00:00:01.367 --> 00:00:06.000
RONALD SMITH: Well, we were
talking about mixing in the

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.700
atmosphere.

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.367
And we did two types
of analysis.

00:00:13.367 --> 00:00:16.800
First of all, we assumed that
there was a turbulence in the

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.967
atmosphere that would mix gases
or particles into a

00:00:21.967 --> 00:00:24.333
larger and larger volume.

00:00:24.333 --> 00:00:26.100
And we did three problems
like that.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:35.033
One was adding a material
to a confined valley.

00:00:35.033 --> 00:00:39.733
The second was adding material
to the atmosphere in an

00:00:39.733 --> 00:00:42.233
unconfined situation.

00:00:42.233 --> 00:00:46.367
Where the turbulence would act
to spread that material out

00:00:46.367 --> 00:00:49.067
progressively with time.

00:00:49.067 --> 00:00:53.400
So the longer the time had
elapsed, the larger would be

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.967
the volume into which the
material had mixed.

00:00:56.967 --> 00:01:01.633
And the more dilute it
would have become.

00:01:01.633 --> 00:01:06.267
The third problem we did was
adding material at a steady

00:01:06.267 --> 00:01:14.233
rate into an atmosphere that has
both turbulence and wind.

00:01:14.233 --> 00:01:18.333
In that case, the added material
forms a kind of a

00:01:18.333 --> 00:01:23.800
plume downwind of the source
point, spreading out as it

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.167
goes horizontally and
vertically, and becoming more

00:01:27.167 --> 00:01:29.333
dilute for that reason.

00:01:29.333 --> 00:01:31.900
It spreads out into more
and more volume as

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.033
it moves down wind.

00:01:33.033 --> 00:01:37.500
So we did problems like
those three last time.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.467
And then I went on to start to
talk about the role of the

00:01:42.467 --> 00:01:45.467
temperature gradient
in mixing.

00:01:45.467 --> 00:01:49.533
It turns out that the
temperature profile in the

00:01:49.533 --> 00:01:53.067
earth's atmosphere plays a very
important role in how

00:01:53.067 --> 00:01:56.833
material mixes into
the atmosphere.

00:01:56.833 --> 00:02:02.933
And that arises because under
certain circumstances, a

00:02:02.933 --> 00:02:11.133
parcel of polluted air will be
able to rise and spread into a

00:02:11.133 --> 00:02:13.133
large volume aloft.

00:02:13.133 --> 00:02:17.433
In other situations, that parcel
if it tries to rise,

00:02:17.433 --> 00:02:21.700
may fall right back down to
where it started and be unable

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:22.900
to mix vertically.

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.967
And this has to do with the
vertical temperature gradient.

00:02:25.967 --> 00:02:29.233
So I'm going to pick up
on that theme today.

00:02:29.233 --> 00:02:31.833
But if there are any questions
on it at this

00:02:31.833 --> 00:02:36.467
point just call out.

00:02:36.467 --> 00:02:36.867
All right.

00:02:36.867 --> 00:02:42.633
So this is the diagram that I
had on the board a little bit

00:02:42.633 --> 00:02:43.133
differently.

00:02:43.133 --> 00:02:48.900
But I was defining atmospheric
stability as the resistance to

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.167
vertical motion.

00:02:53.767 --> 00:02:57.400
And this is a plot of
temperature on the x-axis

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.333
versus height on the y-axis.

00:03:00.333 --> 00:03:05.300
And we put on there a reference
line, which this

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.000
author has written DALR.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.133
That's the dry adiabatic
lapse rate.

00:03:11.133 --> 00:03:13.200
I call it just the adiabatic
lapse rate.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.033
But it's good to call it the
dry adiabatic lapse rate

00:03:17.033 --> 00:03:21.833
because inside a cloud, that
takes on a different slope.

00:03:21.833 --> 00:03:24.133
So this is one when you're
outside a cloud, there's no

00:03:24.133 --> 00:03:25.667
water vapor condensing.

00:03:25.667 --> 00:03:28.933
So we'll call it the dry
adiabatic lapse rate.

00:03:28.933 --> 00:03:34.367
And all these other curves are
possible, actual atmospheric

00:03:34.367 --> 00:03:36.067
lapse rates.

00:03:36.067 --> 00:03:38.267
On Tuesday, maybe
the temperature

00:03:38.267 --> 00:03:40.667
decreases aloft like that.

00:03:40.667 --> 00:03:42.400
On Wednesday, maybe
it's like that.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.733
The next day, maybe
it's like that.

00:03:43.733 --> 00:03:44.900
It might even be like that.

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.700
In other words, from day to day
from hour to hour, you're

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:52.900
going to have different
actual lapse rates.

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.433
And in each case, we're going
to want to compare that with

00:03:56.433 --> 00:04:01.167
this reference curve, the dry
adiabatic lapse rate.

00:04:01.167 --> 00:04:07.333
And as I discussed last time,
all of these that are less

00:04:07.333 --> 00:04:10.900
horizontal, that is more
vertical or more to the right,

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.200
than the dry adiabatic
lapse rate, are going

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.400
to be called stable.

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:20.133
Because if you lift a parcel in
the air, it's going to be

00:04:20.133 --> 00:04:23.900
cooling at a rate of 9.8
degrees per kilometer.

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.533
It's going to end up--

00:04:26.533 --> 00:04:29.433
if I lift it from there to
there, it's new temperature is

00:04:29.433 --> 00:04:30.467
going to be here.

00:04:30.467 --> 00:04:34.600
And that's going to be in all
cases colder than the

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.333
environment into which
it's been lifted.

00:04:38.333 --> 00:04:41.000
If it's colder, it's going to
want to sink back down to

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.233
where it came from.

00:04:42.233 --> 00:04:44.767
So we call that stable.

00:04:44.767 --> 00:04:48.633
The unstable case is where you
have a very strong decrease in

00:04:48.633 --> 00:04:52.033
temperature with height.

00:04:52.033 --> 00:04:56.167
Then if you lift a parcel along
the dry adiabatic lapse

00:04:56.167 --> 00:05:00.700
rate, it's actually getting
warmer than it's environment.

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:03.333
So when it's been lifted a
little bit, it finds itself

00:05:03.333 --> 00:05:05.700
warmer than it's local
environment.

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:06.933
That means it's buoyant.

00:05:06.933 --> 00:05:09.200
And it's going to
rise further.

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:12.400
That's the unstable situation.

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:17.967
So you'll want to practice
sketching these diagrams up to

00:05:17.967 --> 00:05:20.333
be sure that you always get the
right answer about what

00:05:20.333 --> 00:05:22.300
the parcel is going to do.

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:26.400
You might want to practice
lifting a parcel as well as

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.633
pushing a parcel downwards.

00:05:28.633 --> 00:05:33.067
And in all cases, you should be
able to recover this basic

00:05:33.067 --> 00:05:37.667
idea that the atmosphere is
either stable or unstable

00:05:37.667 --> 00:05:42.200
depending on its lapse rate
compared with the reference

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:45.967
value of the adiabatic
lapse rate.

00:05:45.967 --> 00:05:48.833
Questions on that?

00:05:48.833 --> 00:05:49.300
Yes.

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:52.533
STUDENT: Is the dry adiabatic
lapse rate always 9.8?

00:05:52.533 --> 00:05:55.667
PROFESSOR: Yes, in the earth's
atmosphere, it's always 9.8 It

00:05:55.667 --> 00:06:01.833
turns out to be the ratio of the
surface gravity, 9.81, to

00:06:01.833 --> 00:06:04.467
the heat capacity of constant
pressure for

00:06:04.467 --> 00:06:06.533
air, which is 1,004.

00:06:06.533 --> 00:06:09.633
So as long as we're talking
about planet earth, the

00:06:09.633 --> 00:06:12.967
adiabatic lapse rate is
always 9.8, the dry

00:06:12.967 --> 00:06:13.733
adiabatic lapse rate.

00:06:13.733 --> 00:06:16.633
Now if there is moisture
present, then

00:06:16.633 --> 00:06:17.500
it's a different value.

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:19.667
STUDENT: And that's
in what units?

00:06:19.667 --> 00:06:23.300
PROFESSOR: That would be 9.8
would be in degrees Celsius

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:24.533
per kilometer.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:29.333
OK.

00:06:29.333 --> 00:06:34.533
Now I want to apply this
to some situations.

00:06:34.533 --> 00:06:36.067
And let me darken this
a little bit

00:06:36.067 --> 00:06:37.300
so you can see that.

00:06:42.767 --> 00:06:47.733
I want to walk through a typical
diurnal cycle, a day

00:06:47.733 --> 00:06:48.800
night cycle.

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:52.167
And today would be a perfect
example of this, clear sky

00:06:52.167 --> 00:06:55.067
overnight, clear sky
during the day.

00:06:55.067 --> 00:06:58.633
It's going to work very
much like I described

00:06:58.633 --> 00:06:59.767
in these four panels.

00:06:59.767 --> 00:07:06.867
So at 6:00 AM this morning, you
have built up a nocturnal

00:07:06.867 --> 00:07:08.633
boundary layer.

00:07:08.633 --> 00:07:14.367
This is temperature versus
height plotted here with the

00:07:14.367 --> 00:07:15.767
purple curve.

00:07:15.767 --> 00:07:20.033
Notice that there's a positive
lapse rate in the lower part

00:07:20.033 --> 00:07:22.900
of the atmosphere in
the early morning.

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:26.200
The ground has been cooling off
all during the night by

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:29.733
radiating infrared radiation
to space.

00:07:29.733 --> 00:07:34.633
That's drawn heat out of the
lowest few meters of the

00:07:34.633 --> 00:07:35.733
atmosphere.

00:07:35.733 --> 00:07:39.933
And has produced that
positive lapse rate.

00:07:39.933 --> 00:07:42.100
You can call that
an inversion.

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:45.867
In fact, I'm going to call it
a surface level inversion.

00:07:45.867 --> 00:07:49.667
It's an inversion located
right at just above the

00:07:49.667 --> 00:07:51.167
earth's surface.

00:07:51.167 --> 00:07:55.367
And that typically happens
overnight on a clear night

00:07:55.367 --> 00:07:59.367
when the radiation can leave,
can escape the earth's

00:07:59.367 --> 00:08:02.200
atmosphere without
hitting clouds.

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:04.467
So remember where that
fit on the diagram.

00:08:07.067 --> 00:08:09.867
Just to go back.

00:08:09.867 --> 00:08:12.533
That's this.

00:08:12.533 --> 00:08:15.900
So that's a very stable
atmosphere.

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:18.567
And turbulence will
be suppressed.

00:08:18.567 --> 00:08:21.267
There will be very little
turbulence.

00:08:21.267 --> 00:08:23.333
Very little vertical motion.

00:08:23.333 --> 00:08:29.900
And the air will just lie
there quietly in layers.

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:33.600
The wind, which has continued
to blow aloft all during the

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:36.500
day and night, will be
calm at the surface.

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:40.333
Because without the turbulence,
there's no way to

00:08:40.333 --> 00:08:45.133
mix that momentum down to the
surface of the earth.

00:08:45.133 --> 00:08:48.367
Remember the wind aloft
doesn't feel the

00:08:48.367 --> 00:08:50.833
diurnal cycle very much.

00:08:50.833 --> 00:08:52.700
So it blows day and
night typically.

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:55.900
That depends more on the local
weather systems and so on.

00:08:55.900 --> 00:09:00.767
But the winds often go calm at
night at the very surface

00:09:00.767 --> 00:09:03.267
because of this lack of
turbulence to mix

00:09:03.267 --> 00:09:04.767
the momentum down.

00:09:04.767 --> 00:09:07.700
You must have noticed this
if you're a camper

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:10.133
or an outdoors person.

00:09:10.133 --> 00:09:13.400
You will have noticed that very
often, wind decreases to

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:14.800
calm at night.

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:17.133
And then picks up the
next morning.

00:09:17.133 --> 00:09:20.567
I noticed it myself this
morning, for example, sitting

00:09:20.567 --> 00:09:25.667
at home 7:00 in the morning,
looked out, none of the leaves

00:09:25.667 --> 00:09:27.533
were moving.

00:09:27.533 --> 00:09:31.333
And then around 8:00 or 8:30,
suddenly the leaves begin to

00:09:31.333 --> 00:09:32.600
move finally.

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:36.367
Because the earth had heated up
the atmosphere, convection

00:09:36.367 --> 00:09:41.433
began, and you start to get the
wind being brought down.

00:09:41.433 --> 00:09:44.100
And the wind starts to move
at the earth's surface.

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:45.667
So let's go to that
next stage then.

00:09:45.667 --> 00:09:51.367
So 11:00 AM, the sun is
heating the earth.

00:09:51.367 --> 00:09:54.467
If the earth is getting warm
then it's putting heat into

00:09:54.467 --> 00:09:56.700
the lowest few meters
of the atmosphere.

00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:59.933
And that's going to bring that
lapse right around this way,

00:09:59.933 --> 00:10:03.600
hotter below and cooler above.

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:07.967
And that's going to fit into
one of these categories,

00:10:07.967 --> 00:10:10.467
probably that one or that one.

00:10:10.467 --> 00:10:15.067
If it goes unstable, convection
is going to begin.

00:10:15.067 --> 00:10:16.700
And that's what they've
drawn here.

00:10:19.833 --> 00:10:24.433
The heat being provided by the
surface of the earth produces

00:10:24.433 --> 00:10:28.633
a strong negative lapse rate,
pushes the atmosphere into an

00:10:28.633 --> 00:10:32.467
unstable state, and
convection begins.

00:10:32.467 --> 00:10:33.967
The air begins to turn over.

00:10:33.967 --> 00:10:37.667
When it does that, it brings
some of that general wind down

00:10:37.667 --> 00:10:39.833
to the earth's surface.

00:10:39.833 --> 00:10:42.267
That trend continues.

00:10:42.267 --> 00:10:46.733
By 3:00 in the afternoon, that
convection layer has grown to

00:10:46.733 --> 00:10:49.800
a kilometer or a kilometer
and 1/2 deep.

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:54.100
Very often there are cumulus
clouds with their flat bases

00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:56.667
right at the bottom of that--

00:10:56.667 --> 00:11:00.900
or right at the top of that
convective layer.

00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:04.433
So this afternoon, if you look
out, and you see cumulus

00:11:04.433 --> 00:11:07.367
clouds, you'll know that
this has happened.

00:11:07.367 --> 00:11:10.800
And that cloud base is right at
the top of the convection

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:11.567
boundary layer.

00:11:11.567 --> 00:11:15.900
And then when we get to
the evening again,

00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:19.300
the sunlight stops.

00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:23.200
The earth's surface cools
with infrared radiation.

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:26.200
And you start to build
up that surface level

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:28.233
inversion once again.

00:11:28.233 --> 00:11:34.000
So the cycle just repeats day
and night, day and night.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.367
Any questions on this?

00:11:36.367 --> 00:11:36.867
Yes.

00:11:36.867 --> 00:11:38.133
STUDENT: I'm still a little
confused about why the

00:11:38.133 --> 00:11:39.400
inversion one is the
stable atmosphere?

00:11:43.833 --> 00:11:47.567
PROFESSOR: The question is why
is the inversion so stable?

00:11:47.567 --> 00:11:49.333
Well, think of it this way.

00:11:49.333 --> 00:11:53.400
When you lift a parcel, it
gets colder with height.

00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:58.233
And yet if you have a background
lapse rate like

00:11:58.233 --> 00:12:00.667
this, the environment
is actually

00:12:00.667 --> 00:12:03.267
getting warmer with height.

00:12:03.267 --> 00:12:06.267
So you're getting both
things working

00:12:06.267 --> 00:12:08.600
in the stable direction.

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:11.633
The parcel is getting colder
because it's expanding and

00:12:11.633 --> 00:12:14.433
cooling adiabatically.

00:12:14.433 --> 00:12:17.667
Yet, you're pushing it into
an environment which is

00:12:17.667 --> 00:12:20.667
progressively warmer
and warmer.

00:12:20.667 --> 00:12:23.800
So almost certainly, that parcel
is going to find itself

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:25.833
colder than its new
environment.

00:12:25.833 --> 00:12:29.200
And it's going to want to sink
back to where it came from.

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:34.633
So the reason why we say very
stable is because both the

00:12:34.633 --> 00:12:38.000
adiabatic expansion and the
movement into a new

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:43.000
environment both work to make
the parcel want to return to

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.233
where it came from.

00:12:50.367 --> 00:12:52.467
Any questions about
the diurnal cycle?

00:12:57.500 --> 00:12:57.967
Yes.

00:12:57.967 --> 00:12:58.767
STUDENT: Is it just the Earth's
surface temparature

00:12:58.767 --> 00:13:00.100
that drives it?

00:13:04.833 --> 00:13:05.133
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:13:05.133 --> 00:13:06.067
That's right.

00:13:06.067 --> 00:13:10.067
So remember the sun's radiation
is coming through.

00:13:10.067 --> 00:13:11.767
The lower part of the atmosphere
is generally

00:13:11.767 --> 00:13:12.533
transparent.

00:13:12.533 --> 00:13:15.467
And so the sun's radiation is
coming through and hitting the

00:13:15.467 --> 00:13:19.833
earth's surface, warming
it up during the day.

00:13:19.833 --> 00:13:22.867
And that heat is then
transferred immediately from

00:13:22.867 --> 00:13:25.933
the earth's surface to the
first meter or so of the

00:13:25.933 --> 00:13:26.867
atmosphere.

00:13:26.867 --> 00:13:30.267
And that's what causes that
lapse rate to tip over.

00:13:30.267 --> 00:13:32.100
Because you're adding heat
from the bottom.

00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:35.600
Here, you're subtracting heat
from the bottom, giving you

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:37.867
this inversion.

00:13:37.867 --> 00:13:40.767
So you have the earth's
surface playing a very

00:13:40.767 --> 00:13:41.800
important role in this.

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:43.700
That's a good point.

00:13:48.467 --> 00:13:51.467
Now you could also get what's
called an elevated inversion.

00:13:54.867 --> 00:13:57.567
And that's what's
pictured here.

00:13:57.567 --> 00:14:01.267
Whenever you have slow subsiding
air up through the

00:14:01.267 --> 00:14:05.633
troposphere, as you would, for
example, as you do today,

00:14:05.633 --> 00:14:09.233
whenever you have high pressure
and clear skies, you

00:14:09.233 --> 00:14:12.633
can be pretty certain that there
is very slow subsidence.

00:14:12.633 --> 00:14:17.600
The air is slowly descending
through the troposphere.

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:21.167
Well, that air cannot descend
through the earth's surface

00:14:21.167 --> 00:14:22.700
because the earth's
surface is solid.

00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:25.933
So it has to spread out.

00:14:25.933 --> 00:14:29.500
And you get warming here but
not warming at the surface.

00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:34.533
So you end up in this subsidence
situation creating

00:14:34.533 --> 00:14:36.800
an elevated inversion.

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:39.733
If I plotted the temperature,
it would probably look like

00:14:39.733 --> 00:14:45.333
decreasing, then increasing,
and decreasing again in an

00:14:45.333 --> 00:14:47.267
elevated inversion.

00:14:47.267 --> 00:14:50.833
An inversion of this type
too is very stable.

00:14:50.833 --> 00:14:53.400
It's almost impossible
to mix air across it.

00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:56.733
So any pollution put in beneath
will be trapped,

00:14:56.733 --> 00:15:00.533
almost as if it were
a rigid lid.

00:15:00.533 --> 00:15:01.133
But it's not.

00:15:01.133 --> 00:15:02.600
It's air above and air below.

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:06.133
But it's warm air above.

00:15:06.133 --> 00:15:09.333
And therefore parcels that try
to rise up through here find

00:15:09.333 --> 00:15:11.433
themselves too cold,
too dense.

00:15:11.433 --> 00:15:12.700
And they sink back down.

00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:15.567
And they can't mix that
pollutant up into the free

00:15:15.567 --> 00:15:18.400
atmosphere.

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:23.400
Most of the pollution episodes
are connected with these

00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:26.867
elevated inversions.

00:15:26.867 --> 00:15:31.700
For example, some of the most
famous polluted cities in the

00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:35.167
world: Los Angeles; Santiago,
Chile; Mexico

00:15:35.167 --> 00:15:37.533
City; Beijing in China.

00:15:37.533 --> 00:15:39.733
You see pictures of them here.

00:15:39.733 --> 00:15:43.000
In each case, in this case,
you can see the inversion.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.367
Here you can see it as well.

00:15:45.367 --> 00:15:48.167
There is, an elevated inversion
trapping that

00:15:48.167 --> 00:15:52.567
pollutant, preventing it from
being diluted up into the rest

00:15:52.567 --> 00:15:55.367
of the free atmosphere.

00:15:55.367 --> 00:16:01.167
So inversions go together with
air pollution episodes.

00:16:01.167 --> 00:16:04.433
They are very closely linked.

00:16:04.433 --> 00:16:07.267
If the inversion was not there,
this pollution could

00:16:07.267 --> 00:16:09.200
just quickly mix up into
the free atmosphere.

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:12.900
It would be much more
completely diluted.

00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:16.000
And you wouldn't have the
concentration of sulfur

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.567
dioxide, and NO, and ozone,
and so on that you have in

00:16:19.567 --> 00:16:22.100
these polluted episodes.

00:16:25.067 --> 00:16:30.433
I want to give you three
examples of rather famous gas

00:16:30.433 --> 00:16:34.400
releases that kind of illustrate
some of the

00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:37.333
physical principles I'm
discussing today.

00:16:37.333 --> 00:16:46.733
The first two are going to be
brief emissions of toxic gases

00:16:46.733 --> 00:16:50.267
that just happen to take
place at night.

00:16:50.267 --> 00:16:51.567
Now this was a problem.

00:16:51.567 --> 00:16:54.967
If the same thing had happened
during the day, it would not

00:16:54.967 --> 00:16:56.067
have been so much
of a problem.

00:16:56.067 --> 00:17:01.067
But at might remember, you've
got this stable, nocturnal

00:17:01.067 --> 00:17:04.833
surface level inversion that
prevents vertical mixing.

00:17:04.833 --> 00:17:08.667
And therefore, if you emit
something at night, it's not

00:17:08.667 --> 00:17:09.567
going to be diluted.

00:17:09.567 --> 00:17:13.367
It's going to stay in high
concentrations close to the

00:17:13.367 --> 00:17:14.633
earth's surface.

00:17:14.633 --> 00:17:18.200
So unfortunately, these first
two cases, Lake Nyos and

00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:23.133
Bhopal, were both night
time releases.

00:17:23.133 --> 00:17:24.400
Here's the Lake Nyos one.

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:26.267
It's a lake in Africa.

00:17:26.267 --> 00:17:31.233
It's a deep, volcanic lake that
over a period of months

00:17:31.233 --> 00:17:36.033
or years, because the water had
been circulating through

00:17:36.033 --> 00:17:40.900
volcanic rocks beneath, had
built up a high dissolved load

00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:42.833
of carbon dioxide.

00:17:42.833 --> 00:17:46.433
It was dissolved in the liquid
just like it is when you buy a

00:17:46.433 --> 00:17:47.567
can of Coke.

00:17:47.567 --> 00:17:51.933
Most of the CO2 is dissolved
in the liquid.

00:17:51.933 --> 00:17:55.133
And then for some reason, and
no one to this day knows

00:17:55.133 --> 00:18:01.567
exactly why it happened or why
it happened at that point,

00:18:01.567 --> 00:18:07.233
that CO2 one night came out of
solution to form bubbles, rose

00:18:07.233 --> 00:18:10.167
to the surface of the lake,
and then spread

00:18:10.167 --> 00:18:12.600
out across the landscape.

00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:16.533
Remember CO2 has the molecular
weight of 44.

00:18:16.533 --> 00:18:18.033
Air has 29.

00:18:18.033 --> 00:18:20.200
So it's a denser gas than air.

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:23.867
That's going to make it want
to hug the surface as well.

00:18:23.867 --> 00:18:25.367
And because it was a
night, there was a

00:18:25.367 --> 00:18:27.300
surface level inversion.

00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:30.100
That prevented any
vertical mixing.

00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:33.967
So the CO2 stayed in a
concentrated form and just

00:18:33.967 --> 00:18:38.633
spread laterally away from the
lake killing thousands of

00:18:38.633 --> 00:18:43.167
cattle but also hundreds of
people as well as they slept.

00:18:43.167 --> 00:18:47.433
This layer of CO2 just slid over
them and then basically

00:18:47.433 --> 00:18:48.300
suffocated them.

00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:53.133
Because you can't breathe
carbon dioxide.

00:18:53.133 --> 00:18:57.033
I want to make the point again
that this would not have

00:18:57.033 --> 00:19:00.167
happened if the emission had
occurred during the day.

00:19:00.167 --> 00:19:04.433
There would have been enough
mixing, enough convection to

00:19:04.433 --> 00:19:06.800
dilute that carbon dioxide.

00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:10.133
And you wouldn't have
had those deaths.

00:19:10.133 --> 00:19:17.600
The Bhopal incident in India,
some 25 ago, was a Union

00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:24.333
Carbide plant making what's
called MIC, methyl isocyanate.

00:19:24.333 --> 00:19:27.867
It sounds pretty ugly,
and it is.

00:19:27.867 --> 00:19:31.333
There were some storage
tanks that leaked.

00:19:31.333 --> 00:19:37.300
And the normal systems for
capturing that leak were not

00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:38.667
functioning properly.

00:19:38.667 --> 00:19:42.200
And it happened to then get
released into the lower

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:46.433
atmosphere unfortunately
at night.

00:19:46.433 --> 00:19:50.600
So rather than getting mixed and
convectively diluted, it

00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:55.233
spread out as a layer to the
surrounding houses and

00:19:55.233 --> 00:19:59.067
hundreds of people were killed
as they were overtaken by this

00:19:59.067 --> 00:20:02.633
layer of methyl isocyanate.

00:20:02.633 --> 00:20:07.067
And that was a big deal at
the time, front page Time

00:20:07.067 --> 00:20:09.233
magazine and so on.

00:20:09.233 --> 00:20:12.667
I was in India a few months
after that and

00:20:12.667 --> 00:20:13.733
took a lot of abuse.

00:20:13.733 --> 00:20:21.667
Because this incident started
an intensive ten years of

00:20:21.667 --> 00:20:25.533
anti-Americanism in India
because of this incident.

00:20:25.533 --> 00:20:27.267
And it's still remembered
today.

00:20:27.267 --> 00:20:30.633
If you talk to people from India
and mention Bhopal, they

00:20:30.633 --> 00:20:35.800
will talk about how the evil
US chemical corporations

00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:38.967
caused this terrible accident
in their country.

00:20:38.967 --> 00:20:40.333
And they have a good point.

00:20:40.333 --> 00:20:41.833
But there was some luck
involved too,

00:20:41.833 --> 00:20:42.800
bad luck that is.

00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:47.200
Because the release happened to
occur at night rather than

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:50.967
during the day

00:20:50.967 --> 00:20:55.967
So Chernobyl, a different kind
of situation; it was the

00:20:55.967 --> 00:21:00.333
meltdown of a nuclear
power plant.

00:21:00.333 --> 00:21:02.733
It lasted for several days.

00:21:02.733 --> 00:21:06.333
So it's not a question
of day versus night.

00:21:06.333 --> 00:21:10.967
In this case, the warm
radioactive gases released

00:21:10.967 --> 00:21:15.300
from that plant did lift upwards
into the atmosphere

00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:18.033
and then the wind carried
it to great distances.

00:21:18.033 --> 00:21:21.467
So maybe the drawback, perhaps
the drawback of having a

00:21:21.467 --> 00:21:25.000
daytime release is
it gets diluted.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.833
But it also gets up in the
atmosphere where the winds can

00:21:27.833 --> 00:21:29.333
carry it to a greater
distance.

00:21:29.333 --> 00:21:33.533
And if the substance is diluted
to a safe level by

00:21:33.533 --> 00:21:35.533
that mixing process that's OK.

00:21:35.533 --> 00:21:38.267
But in this case, there was so
much radioactive material that

00:21:38.267 --> 00:21:42.400
even though it was spread over
large parts of eastern Europe

00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:46.533
and northern Europe, it still
caused damaging levels of

00:21:46.533 --> 00:21:50.833
radioactivity spread
by the winds.

00:21:50.833 --> 00:21:55.200
This was mostly radioactive
iodine that then settles on

00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:57.867
the grasses and people get
it into their system.

00:21:57.867 --> 00:22:02.600
And they end up with radioactive
induced diseases.

00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:04.633
Same thing happened in this
country during the nuclear

00:22:04.633 --> 00:22:08.833
testing episode back in the 50's
and early 60's when we

00:22:08.833 --> 00:22:11.800
were doing, believe
it or not, aerial

00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:16.633
nuclear tests in Nevada.

00:22:16.633 --> 00:22:19.300
Where in mid latitudes, the
winds are normally west to

00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:20.900
east in these latitudes.

00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:23.833
So this shows some of the
radioactive regions that were

00:22:23.833 --> 00:22:29.700
found coming from aerial
explosions and the wind

00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:35.267
carried that radioactive
material from west to east.

00:22:35.267 --> 00:22:36.533
Any questions on this?

00:22:39.433 --> 00:22:42.433
The point here is just to talk
about what happens when you

00:22:42.433 --> 00:22:44.767
put substances into
the atmosphere.

00:22:44.767 --> 00:22:46.333
How does it get mixed around?

00:22:46.333 --> 00:22:47.933
What conditions control that?

00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:57.400
Forest fires are
a good example.

00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:59.200
You're burning biomass.

00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:01.933
You're producing smoke.

00:23:01.933 --> 00:23:06.100
And depending on the atmospheric
conditions, that

00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:08.900
may hug the surface
and move downwind

00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:09.767
like it's shown there.

00:23:09.767 --> 00:23:15.267
Or it might rise to a higher
altitude and then move across

00:23:15.267 --> 00:23:18.033
through the atmosphere
without polluting

00:23:18.033 --> 00:23:19.167
the very lowest levels.

00:23:19.167 --> 00:23:21.500
Eventually it'll fall back
down to the surface.

00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:24.733
But if it's hot enough material,
it will rise and get

00:23:24.733 --> 00:23:29.100
carried away some kilometers
above the earth's surface.

00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:29.733
Those are the two

00:23:29.733 --> 00:23:33.033
possibilities with forest fires.

00:23:33.033 --> 00:23:34.467
Smokestacks are the same way.

00:23:34.467 --> 00:23:40.733
Now a smokestack is designed to
get this smoke released at

00:23:40.733 --> 00:23:45.000
a point that's above any surface
level inversion.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.300
So then it'll be carried
quickly into the free

00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:50.700
atmosphere and become
rapidly diluted.

00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:55.967
So that protects the local
environment from the negative

00:23:55.967 --> 00:23:57.667
effects of the smoke and
the air pollution.

00:23:57.667 --> 00:24:00.567
But it does, of course, mean
that now the material will be

00:24:00.567 --> 00:24:04.967
carried to greater distances
because you've put it up into

00:24:04.967 --> 00:24:06.933
a level where the winds
are stronger.

00:24:06.933 --> 00:24:09.967
And it will be carried
off downwind.

00:24:09.967 --> 00:24:14.467
As in our little problem we
did last time with a point

00:24:14.467 --> 00:24:16.867
source and the wind
carrying it away.

00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:26.533
During the first Gulf War,
the Kuwaiti oil fires.

00:24:26.533 --> 00:24:29.567
You see them here burning
off patches of

00:24:29.567 --> 00:24:31.033
oil, producing smoke.

00:24:31.033 --> 00:24:32.167
They're rising.

00:24:32.167 --> 00:24:35.133
Typically they're so hot that
they'll rise a couple of

00:24:35.133 --> 00:24:37.033
kilometers up in
the atmosphere.

00:24:37.033 --> 00:24:38.200
And then they'll level out.

00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:42.733
And they'll move horizontally
under the action of the wind.

00:24:42.733 --> 00:24:45.933
In just a moment, I'll talk
about how you can estimate how

00:24:45.933 --> 00:24:51.667
far these things rise before
they start to spread downwind.

00:24:51.667 --> 00:24:57.767
Here's an aerial photo of these
black, sooty, smoky

00:24:57.767 --> 00:25:00.433
plumes from the oil fires being

00:25:00.433 --> 00:25:01.667
carried away by the wind.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.167
So the most recent, interesting
example we've had

00:25:08.167 --> 00:25:10.933
of this are these wonderful
Iceland volcanoes.

00:25:10.933 --> 00:25:14.033
I say wonderful because while
they caused a lot of damage,

00:25:14.033 --> 00:25:15.833
they were amazing to see.

00:25:15.833 --> 00:25:19.000
The pictures were really,
quite remarkable.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:20.900
Here's an example.

00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:22.533
You can't make out the
mountain very well.

00:25:22.533 --> 00:25:25.233
But there's a volcanic plume
coming out of it.

00:25:25.233 --> 00:25:27.700
It's rising to a certain
level and then

00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:31.033
spreading out downwind.

00:25:31.033 --> 00:25:34.633
And I'd like you to think for a
minute about exactly why the

00:25:34.633 --> 00:25:37.733
plume looks like that?

00:25:37.733 --> 00:25:42.267
So I pulled off a balloon
sounding for Iceland.

00:25:42.267 --> 00:25:45.033
It wasn't at the moment
of that eruption.

00:25:45.033 --> 00:25:46.333
It was just from a
couple days ago.

00:25:46.333 --> 00:25:49.667
But I think the story
is the same.

00:25:49.667 --> 00:25:52.167
Here's temperature on
this axis versus

00:25:52.167 --> 00:25:53.267
height on that axis.

00:25:53.267 --> 00:25:57.200
And the temperature is
the black curve here.

00:25:57.200 --> 00:26:01.067
And the blue curves are that
reference line we've been

00:26:01.067 --> 00:26:03.500
using, the dry adiabatic--

00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:08.067
sorry green curves are the
dry adiabatic lapse rate.

00:26:08.067 --> 00:26:15.733
So if I put in an air parcel
at 40 degrees Celsius.

00:26:15.733 --> 00:26:18.400
The air temperature at the
ground is only on that day

00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:22.233
about plus four Celsius.

00:26:22.233 --> 00:26:27.033
That air parcel is going to be
hotter and therefore buoyant.

00:26:27.033 --> 00:26:28.633
It's going to rise.

00:26:28.633 --> 00:26:32.267
As it rises, it's going
to cool adiabatically.

00:26:32.267 --> 00:26:36.667
And eventually, it will come to
the same temperature as the

00:26:36.667 --> 00:26:38.500
environment.

00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:41.433
At that point, it will have
the same density and

00:26:41.433 --> 00:26:42.800
temperature as the
environment.

00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:44.267
It'll stop rising.

00:26:44.267 --> 00:26:47.167
And it'll go flat and
just move downwind.

00:26:47.167 --> 00:26:53.500
So the point is that a hot,
buoyant plume of air will

00:26:53.500 --> 00:27:00.700
rise, cooling as it rises, until
its temperature matches

00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:02.600
that of the environment.

00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:05.533
And then it has found it's
appropriate level, there's no

00:27:05.533 --> 00:27:07.467
reason for it to rise further.

00:27:07.467 --> 00:27:10.000
It'll then spread downwind.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:14.033
Eventually, the particles in
that plume will begin to fall

00:27:14.033 --> 00:27:15.433
out gravitationally.

00:27:15.433 --> 00:27:18.933
But that could take weeks or
even months to get that

00:27:18.933 --> 00:27:19.933
material out.

00:27:19.933 --> 00:27:23.400
So when you see a diagram, you
see a picture like this, just

00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:26.300
be aware that if that
air were even hotter

00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:27.533
it would rise higher.

00:27:27.533 --> 00:27:30.767
If it were cooler, it'll rise
less high and spread out at

00:27:30.767 --> 00:27:31.600
this level.

00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:35.700
That elevation is being
controlled by the properties

00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:38.667
of the air that's
being emitted.

00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:43.333
Questions on that?

00:27:45.467 --> 00:27:45.933
Yes.

00:27:45.933 --> 00:27:47.533
STUDENT: What if there was wind
right at the bottom--

00:27:47.533 --> 00:27:47.567
right above the volcano?

00:27:47.567 --> 00:27:48.833
Would it go that--?

00:27:53.867 --> 00:27:55.300
PROFESSOR: The question
is what if there

00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:55.967
is wind at the surface?

00:27:55.967 --> 00:27:58.133
Well, there may have
been some wind.

00:27:58.133 --> 00:27:59.400
Let's go back to that.

00:28:02.167 --> 00:28:03.667
It looks like it's going
straight up.

00:28:03.667 --> 00:28:07.033
But if there was a wind down
here of course that would tilt

00:28:07.033 --> 00:28:08.000
it as it rose.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.600
Let's say the wind is from left
to right in this diagram.

00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:11.800
That would tilt this plume.

00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:13.700
It already has a
bit of a tilt.

00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:16.600
But still it would rise to this
level and then move off

00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:17.600
horizontally.

00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:20.733
It'll always follow the wind.

00:28:20.733 --> 00:28:24.333
But it will continue to rise
until it has neutral buoyancy.

00:28:24.333 --> 00:28:26.133
And then it'll stay
at that level.

00:28:26.133 --> 00:28:27.367
Was there another question?

00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:31.733
No, OK.

00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:39.133
Sandstorms can do
a similar thing.

00:28:39.133 --> 00:28:40.467
The winds can pick up--

00:28:40.467 --> 00:28:43.133
this is off the west
coast of Africa.

00:28:43.133 --> 00:28:46.733
The wind has picked up some dust
off the Sahara desert and

00:28:46.733 --> 00:28:49.300
carried it out over the ocean.

00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:52.333
And turbulence is keeping
it aloft.

00:28:52.333 --> 00:28:55.633
Eventually, gravitational
settling will make that stuff

00:28:55.633 --> 00:28:58.800
fall back on to the
ocean's surface.

00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:02.433
So you see the same factors
at play in this natural

00:29:02.433 --> 00:29:06.267
phenomenon of just picking up
dust from the earth's surface.

00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:15.133
I want to switch gears and begin
to talk about moisture

00:29:15.133 --> 00:29:16.367
in the atmosphere.

00:29:26.133 --> 00:29:28.600
And we'll continue this subject
next time as well.

00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:32.033
So you should be reading in your
book now about clouds and

00:29:32.033 --> 00:29:35.300
precipitation and water vapor
in the atmosphere.

00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:40.100
And this material will be on
the examination as well.

00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:42.000
So I want to start with
some definitions.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:43.867
And I haven't written
them all out here.

00:29:43.867 --> 00:29:46.133
Because I think your book
does a good job on this.

00:29:46.133 --> 00:29:48.633
Or maybe you already
know these.

00:29:48.633 --> 00:29:50.133
I'm going to run through
them very quickly.

00:29:50.133 --> 00:29:53.600
But you should be aware of
each of these six things.

00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:59.133
They're all alternative ways of
describing how much water

00:29:59.133 --> 00:30:02.067
vapor you have in the air.

00:30:02.067 --> 00:30:08.633
So in fact, if I know any one of
these, I can compute, or in

00:30:08.633 --> 00:30:12.833
some other way determine,
the other five.

00:30:12.833 --> 00:30:14.767
But you should be familiar
with all six of these.

00:30:14.767 --> 00:30:18.933
So one measure of how much water
vapor you have in the

00:30:18.933 --> 00:30:22.833
atmosphere is the partial
pressure.

00:30:22.833 --> 00:30:26.233
What contribution are the water
vapor molecules making

00:30:26.233 --> 00:30:29.833
to the total pressure
of the air?

00:30:29.833 --> 00:30:32.333
It's probably only a
very tiny fraction.

00:30:32.333 --> 00:30:36.367
If the pressure in this room is
at 1,013 millibars, maybe

00:30:36.367 --> 00:30:42.633
only five or six of those
millibars are due to the water

00:30:42.633 --> 00:30:44.233
vapor molecules.

00:30:44.233 --> 00:30:45.533
But you should be able
to compute that.

00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:51.467
The saturation vapor pressure
is not actually a measure of

00:30:51.467 --> 00:30:58.767
how much you have. It's the
maximum amount you can have.

00:30:58.767 --> 00:31:03.067
When you get that amount of
water vapor and try to add

00:31:03.067 --> 00:31:07.700
more, the excess will
condense out.

00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:09.667
And this is a strong function
of temperature.

00:31:09.667 --> 00:31:13.200
I'll be talking about that
in just a moment.

00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:16.333
The dew point is a measure of
how much water vapor you have.

00:31:16.333 --> 00:31:23.267
If you cool the air down to the
dew point then water vapor

00:31:23.267 --> 00:31:25.967
will begin to condense.

00:31:25.967 --> 00:31:29.433
So it's the temperature at which
water vapor begins to

00:31:29.433 --> 00:31:32.333
condense out.

00:31:32.333 --> 00:31:37.867
The specific humidity is the
ratio of the mass of water

00:31:37.867 --> 00:31:39.833
vapor to the mass of air.

00:31:39.833 --> 00:31:43.900
It's like a mixing ratio,
grams per kilogram, or

00:31:43.900 --> 00:31:45.433
kilograms per kilogram.

00:31:45.433 --> 00:31:48.367
For every kilogram of air,
how much water has

00:31:48.367 --> 00:31:50.200
been mixed into it?

00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:52.500
That's the specific humidity.

00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:58.700
The relative humidity is the
ratio of the partial pressure

00:31:58.700 --> 00:32:01.167
of water vapor to the
saturation value.

00:32:01.167 --> 00:32:03.300
It's the ratio of
this to this.

00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:05.367
It's the relative humidity.

00:32:05.367 --> 00:32:08.733
That's important because that
tells you how close you are to

00:32:08.733 --> 00:32:10.933
saturation.

00:32:10.933 --> 00:32:14.800
If you're at 50% relative
humidity, that means you could

00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:18.700
add twice as much water vapor
and just then be bringing it

00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:20.667
to the saturation state.

00:32:20.667 --> 00:32:25.433
If you're at a 100% relative
humidity, there's already just

00:32:25.433 --> 00:32:27.600
as much water vapor
as can be held.

00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:32.933
If you added anymore, you would
have to condense out.

00:32:32.933 --> 00:32:35.667
And you'll recall the wet bulb
depression from the lab

00:32:35.667 --> 00:32:36.867
exercise you did.

00:32:36.867 --> 00:32:40.200
One way of measuring how much
water vapor you have is to

00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:44.333
have a wet bulb and a dry
bulb thermometer.

00:32:44.333 --> 00:32:48.767
If they read the same, you know
there's no evaporation

00:32:48.767 --> 00:32:52.700
from the wet bulb, which means
the humidity is 100%.

00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:56.567
If they read differently, that
means the air is somewhat dry

00:32:56.567 --> 00:33:01.100
is able to evaporate water
from the wetted wick.

00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:03.967
And that'll give you a different
temperature for the

00:33:03.967 --> 00:33:05.133
two thermometers.

00:33:05.133 --> 00:33:06.767
That's the wet bulb
depression.

00:33:06.767 --> 00:33:11.433
And from that you can compute
any of these others, except

00:33:11.433 --> 00:33:11.933
for that one.

00:33:11.933 --> 00:33:15.133
You can compute those
other four.

00:33:15.133 --> 00:33:19.633
Any questions on these measures
of water vapor?

00:33:22.167 --> 00:33:25.100
I'm kind of assuming that you
know this already from a high

00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:26.733
school physics or
chemistry class.

00:33:26.733 --> 00:33:32.667
So this is probably a little
bit of a review here.

00:33:32.667 --> 00:33:37.367
Some other definitions
we're going to need--

00:33:37.367 --> 00:33:44.533
Condensation is when you change
water vapor to liquid.

00:33:44.533 --> 00:33:47.333
Or sometimes we use that
word also when we're

00:33:47.333 --> 00:33:49.067
condensing it to ice.

00:33:49.067 --> 00:33:53.333
But usually it's used when
we condense it to liquid.

00:33:53.333 --> 00:33:55.300
Evaporation is the
reverse of that.

00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:58.933
It's when you take water in the
liquid form and evaporate

00:33:58.933 --> 00:34:00.733
it, put it back in
the vapor state.

00:34:03.233 --> 00:34:07.600
When you do either of those
things, there is heat either

00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:09.833
taken in or released.

00:34:09.833 --> 00:34:13.533
And that heat is called the
latent heat of condensation.

00:34:13.533 --> 00:34:18.167
When you're evaporating water,
you have to put heat in.

00:34:18.167 --> 00:34:21.033
When you're condensing water,
heat comes out.

00:34:25.033 --> 00:34:27.833
I want to make a clear
distinction between cloud

00:34:27.833 --> 00:34:31.267
droplets and raindrops.

00:34:31.267 --> 00:34:36.267
A cloud droplet is a typical
water drop that you see that

00:34:36.267 --> 00:34:37.133
makes up a cloud.

00:34:37.133 --> 00:34:40.133
You look up at a cloud in the
sky, it is composed of

00:34:40.133 --> 00:34:42.333
millions of cloud droplets.

00:34:42.333 --> 00:34:46.067
We put the little suffix "let"
there to remind us

00:34:46.067 --> 00:34:47.600
that these are small.

00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:57.767
A typical cloud droplet is about
ten microns in diameter.

00:34:57.767 --> 00:34:59.700
Ten microns in diameter.

00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:02.200
A micron, remember, is a
millionth of a meter.

00:35:05.333 --> 00:35:09.433
A raindrop is a kind
of liquid drop you

00:35:09.433 --> 00:35:12.433
find falling to earth.

00:35:12.433 --> 00:35:16.033
And they are typically about
a millimeter in size.

00:35:19.167 --> 00:35:23.533
In other words, about a
hundred times larger.

00:35:23.533 --> 00:35:27.333
There is a factor of about one
hundred in the size of these

00:35:27.333 --> 00:35:28.600
two different droplets.

00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:37.700
Questions so far on
these definitions?

00:35:40.567 --> 00:35:44.533
Supercooled liquid water is
liquid water that has been

00:35:44.533 --> 00:35:48.467
cooled down below the normal
freezing point.

00:35:48.467 --> 00:35:55.567
Freezing point for fresh water
is zero degrees Celsius.

00:35:55.567 --> 00:35:59.267
And yet in the atmosphere, we
often find liquid water at

00:35:59.267 --> 00:36:02.200
temperatures of minus
ten, minus 20,

00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:05.233
even minus 30 Celsius.

00:36:05.233 --> 00:36:09.233
It's in the liquid state, and
yet it is below the normal

00:36:09.233 --> 00:36:10.633
freezing point of water.

00:36:10.633 --> 00:36:17.567
We call water in that state
supercooled liquid water.

00:36:17.567 --> 00:36:19.733
It wants to freeze.

00:36:19.733 --> 00:36:22.400
It's at a temperature where
it should be frozen.

00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:26.767
But it needs some kind of a
trigger to get the freezing

00:36:26.767 --> 00:36:28.333
process started.

00:36:28.333 --> 00:36:33.000
And it turns out that plays a
big role in the generation of

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:38.000
precipitation, as I'll be
describing next time.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:41.700
And then this word riming, which
is what happens when a

00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:45.233
super cooled droplet
hits something.

00:36:45.233 --> 00:36:46.667
It wants to freeze.

00:36:46.667 --> 00:36:51.633
When it hits an object, it'll
probably freeze upon impact

00:36:51.633 --> 00:36:56.367
and stick to the object as
a frozen piece of water--

00:36:56.367 --> 00:36:59.000
piece of ice stuck
to the surface.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:04.500
That is called riming, that
process of having super cooled

00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:08.367
water freeze upon impact.

00:37:08.367 --> 00:37:09.633
Questions on this?

00:37:12.500 --> 00:37:14.233
OK, well, that's a lot
of definitions.

00:37:17.367 --> 00:37:20.800
The earth, of course,
is the water planet.

00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:25.100
It's covered by large
oceans of water.

00:37:25.100 --> 00:37:29.367
The water gets up into the
atmosphere and then in areas

00:37:29.367 --> 00:37:34.800
where the air is rising, there
is adiabatic cooling, which

00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:39.300
will drop the air temperature,
drop the saturation vapor

00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:43.000
pressure, and bring that air--
bring the water vapor in that

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:45.800
air to saturation.

00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:49.567
And as that rising air
continues, then the excess

00:37:49.567 --> 00:37:52.300
water vapor will condense
to form cloud droplets.

00:37:52.300 --> 00:37:55.500
So you see clouds scattered
around in the earth's

00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:59.033
atmosphere, you can be almost
certain that every place you

00:37:59.033 --> 00:38:02.567
see a cloud, whether it's
large or small, there is

00:38:02.567 --> 00:38:05.067
rising air.

00:38:05.067 --> 00:38:09.800
And almost every place you find
the sky free of clouds,

00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:13.100
there is sinking air.

00:38:13.100 --> 00:38:17.633
Because remember, rising
air forms clouds

00:38:17.633 --> 00:38:18.933
by adiabatic cooling.

00:38:21.967 --> 00:38:25.167
So you look at something like
this, and well, about half of

00:38:25.167 --> 00:38:25.900
this is cloud.

00:38:25.900 --> 00:38:26.867
And half of it is clear.

00:38:26.867 --> 00:38:28.867
Well, that means half
the air is rising.

00:38:28.867 --> 00:38:30.200
Half the air is sinking.

00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:32.867
The patterns are complicated.

00:38:32.867 --> 00:38:36.833
They're connected with a variety
of things like fronts,

00:38:36.833 --> 00:38:44.333
thunderstorms, deep convection
over the equator.

00:38:44.333 --> 00:38:48.367
But in all cases, it's rising
motion versus sinking motion--

00:38:48.367 --> 00:38:51.833
very clearly displayed when you
look at a map like this.

00:38:55.567 --> 00:39:01.400
So the key thing to understand
about clouds then, or about

00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:06.800
water vapor I should say, is
how do we take air that is

00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:10.600
under saturated or sub-saturated
and bring it to

00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:11.867
the saturated condition?

00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:19.500
And I'm going to run through the
three ways that are active

00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:22.300
in the earth's atmosphere
for bringing air to

00:39:22.300 --> 00:39:25.300
the saturated state.

00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:28.800
Remember you're starting with
air that has a relative

00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:32.067
humidity less than a 100%.

00:39:32.067 --> 00:39:40.233
And you're asking how can I
bring it to 100% and above?

00:39:40.233 --> 00:39:44.433
Probably the most obvious way is
to add moisture, add water

00:39:44.433 --> 00:39:45.700
vapor to that air parcel.

00:39:51.167 --> 00:39:53.033
I'll show some examples
of that but sea

00:39:53.033 --> 00:39:55.567
smoke, contrails, stacks.

00:39:58.233 --> 00:40:02.233
Smokestacks sometimes give
off clouds in this way.

00:40:02.233 --> 00:40:05.867
And human breath, when you
breathe out on a cold day, you

00:40:05.867 --> 00:40:07.433
can create a little
cloud using this

00:40:07.433 --> 00:40:09.867
mechanism of adding moisture.

00:40:09.867 --> 00:40:12.600
Another ways is to cool
by removing heat.

00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:16.200
If you have air that a
sub-saturated, but you remove

00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:20.133
heat, you're going to drop
the temperature.

00:40:20.133 --> 00:40:24.800
If you drop the temperature,
you're going to drop the

00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:28.333
saturation vapor pressure.

00:40:28.333 --> 00:40:31.133
And you keep doing that,
you're going to

00:40:31.133 --> 00:40:32.000
bring the two together.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:34.167
You're going to bring the amount
of partial pressure

00:40:34.167 --> 00:40:38.700
water vapor together with the
saturation partial pressure.

00:40:38.700 --> 00:40:39.600
They'll be equal.

00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:43.133
And you'll have the saturated
condition.

00:40:43.133 --> 00:40:45.633
The third method is by adiabatic
expansion, that is

00:40:45.633 --> 00:40:48.033
by lifting air parcels
up in the atmosphere.

00:40:50.867 --> 00:40:52.500
I'm going to give you examples
of all these.

00:40:56.933 --> 00:41:00.167
So first, I'll be
adding moisture.

00:41:00.167 --> 00:41:04.167
This is something called
sea smoke.

00:41:04.167 --> 00:41:07.333
Here's an aircraft carrier
looking out

00:41:07.333 --> 00:41:08.267
over the ocean's surface.

00:41:08.267 --> 00:41:11.267
It has a very peculiar
appearance.

00:41:11.267 --> 00:41:16.667
It appears to be tufts of cloud
torn apart by turbulence

00:41:16.667 --> 00:41:21.933
but generally hugging
the ocean's surface.

00:41:21.933 --> 00:41:24.667
What's happening there is you
have cold air moving across

00:41:24.667 --> 00:41:25.833
the ocean's surface.

00:41:25.833 --> 00:41:28.267
And the ocean is warm.

00:41:28.267 --> 00:41:32.733
So the ocean is evaporating
its moisture into the

00:41:32.733 --> 00:41:33.633
atmosphere.

00:41:33.633 --> 00:41:38.100
But then as soon as it does
that, the air being so cold

00:41:38.100 --> 00:41:40.900
with that extra water vapor
being added, you've brought

00:41:40.900 --> 00:41:42.233
the air to saturation.

00:41:42.233 --> 00:41:46.867
And you start to form these
little tufts of cloud or fog.

00:41:46.867 --> 00:41:49.200
So that's sometimes
called sea smoke.

00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:50.833
It's not smoke.

00:41:50.833 --> 00:41:52.333
You're not burning anything.

00:41:52.333 --> 00:41:57.233
But because sometimes that's
just the traditional name for

00:41:57.233 --> 00:42:00.833
it is sea smoke.

00:42:00.833 --> 00:42:03.767
Here's another example from
the Northeastern Labrador

00:42:03.767 --> 00:42:09.767
current up off the coast
of Nova Scotia.

00:42:09.767 --> 00:42:15.567
Whenever you get cold air moving
over warm water, you

00:42:15.567 --> 00:42:18.033
are likely to get
this situation.

00:42:18.033 --> 00:42:22.500
Water evaporates from the warm
water, adds moisture to the

00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:25.600
cold air, you've brought
that air to saturation.

00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:30.933
And little clouds appear
to form on the surface.

00:42:30.933 --> 00:42:34.967
A contrail is that way.

00:42:34.967 --> 00:42:40.133
A contrail is a contraction
for condensation trail.

00:42:40.133 --> 00:42:46.167
And here's an aircraft producing
four contrails, one

00:42:46.167 --> 00:42:47.433
from each engine.

00:42:49.867 --> 00:42:55.800
So you're burning hydrocarbons
in the aircraft engine.

00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:58.867
The chemical byproducts of
this burning are carbon

00:42:58.867 --> 00:43:01.467
dioxide and water vapor.

00:43:01.467 --> 00:43:05.000
So the exhaust from the engine
is part water vapor.

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:08.833
You're adding it to this cold
air, which was sub-saturated

00:43:08.833 --> 00:43:09.367
to begin with.

00:43:09.367 --> 00:43:11.267
But you've added enough
water vapor.

00:43:11.267 --> 00:43:14.467
So now you've saturated
the air and beyond.

00:43:14.467 --> 00:43:17.900
And the excess goes into these
tiny condensed particles

00:43:17.900 --> 00:43:19.900
either liquid or ice.

00:43:19.900 --> 00:43:25.767
Those are probably liquid as a
result of adding water vapor

00:43:25.767 --> 00:43:28.233
to cold air.

00:43:28.233 --> 00:43:29.500
Any questions on this?

00:43:35.333 --> 00:43:37.133
There's some contrails
from a distance.

00:43:42.133 --> 00:43:48.433
Now later on, those contrails
may seem to lose their

00:43:48.433 --> 00:43:49.600
contrail appearance.

00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:50.967
They may spread out.

00:43:50.967 --> 00:43:51.900
They may diffuse.

00:43:51.900 --> 00:43:53.367
They may go unstable.

00:43:53.367 --> 00:43:54.900
They may even lead to
what looks like

00:43:54.900 --> 00:43:56.067
natural cirrus clouds.

00:43:56.067 --> 00:43:58.833
But even that more natural
looking cloud, I think, on

00:43:58.833 --> 00:44:02.167
this particular day started
out as a contrail.

00:44:02.167 --> 00:44:05.267
It just spread a bit by
turbulent diffusion.

00:44:08.133 --> 00:44:11.667
If you have a cooling tower
like from a nuclear power

00:44:11.667 --> 00:44:14.067
plant, that's not smoke that's
coming out of it.

00:44:14.067 --> 00:44:18.467
Tha's just hot, moist air.

00:44:18.467 --> 00:44:21.833
You're adding water vapor to a
dry atmosphere bringing it to

00:44:21.833 --> 00:44:25.633
saturation and causing what
appears to be a cloud.

00:44:25.633 --> 00:44:26.533
Again that's not smoke.

00:44:26.533 --> 00:44:32.733
That's just condensed
water in the cloud.

00:44:32.733 --> 00:44:39.267
And you, yourself on a chilly
October or November morning,

00:44:39.267 --> 00:44:43.533
if you breathe out, the water
vapor that's been added to the

00:44:43.533 --> 00:44:49.000
air in your lungs suddenly is
added to the atmosphere

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:50.733
bringing it to saturation.

00:44:50.733 --> 00:44:54.567
And the excess condenses
to form the cloud.

00:44:54.567 --> 00:44:57.867
So this first one--

00:44:57.867 --> 00:45:01.133
Well, I think I'll quit there.

00:45:01.133 --> 00:45:03.533
We're going to continue this
theme next time of looking at

00:45:03.533 --> 00:45:06.200
how water vapor acts
in the atmosphere.

00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:10.467
Our target is to get to a point
where we understand how

00:45:10.467 --> 00:45:12.133
clouds and precipitation form.

00:45:12.133 --> 00:45:15.133
So be reading ahead in your
book about clouds and

00:45:15.133 --> 00:45:16.400
precipitation.

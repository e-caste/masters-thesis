00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:02.850
Prof: Right.
 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.661
Well, last time I was looking
at the vital social distinctions

00:00:07.661 --> 00:00:12.158
that were recognized in the
sixteenth century and also how

00:00:12.158 --> 00:00:15.550
people conceived of society as a
whole.

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:19.126
So today I want to come down to
the other end of the scale and

00:00:19.126 --> 00:00:21.940
look at the most fundamental
unit of society,

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:25.391
the household,
the unit in which most people

00:00:25.391 --> 00:00:29.806
spent their lives and which
governed most of their daily

00:00:29.806 --> 00:00:31.010
activities.
 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:33.880
So let's begin with some
definitions.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.561
The household can be defined in
the first instance as being a

00:00:37.561 --> 00:00:40.381
unit of residence,
of course, but also,

00:00:40.381 --> 00:00:44.980
as I indicated last time,
it was a unit of authority.

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.607
It's a group of people,
some related,

00:00:47.607 --> 00:00:50.599
some unrelated,
living under the same roof

00:00:50.599 --> 00:00:53.810
under the authority of a
household head;

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:57.490
usually a man,
sometimes a widowed woman.

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:00.569
And in addition the household
has been described as a unit

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:05.465
that was 'geared for work',
the work which was necessary to

00:01:05.465 --> 00:01:11.698
satisfy its needs as a unit of
production and of consumption

00:01:11.698 --> 00:01:14.129
and of reproduction.
 

00:01:14.129 --> 00:01:18.150
So all households have that
much in common but they vary

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.313
greatly in their size,
their composition,

00:01:21.313 --> 00:01:25.387
and the complexity of the
relationships contained within

00:01:25.387 --> 00:01:25.980
them.
 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:28.450
If we go to the top of the
social scale,

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.096
the households of the nobility
and the gentry could be very

00:01:32.096 --> 00:01:35.238
large institutions,
indeed sometimes vast

00:01:35.238 --> 00:01:36.410
institutions.
 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:40.271
They were organized to maintain
not only a noble family at an

00:01:40.271 --> 00:01:44.206
expected level of magnificence--
and to be magnificent was one

00:01:44.206 --> 00:01:47.640
of the qualities of a nobleman
in contemporary thought--

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.313
but also they were the centers
for administering landed

00:01:50.313 --> 00:01:52.235
estates;
they were the centers for

00:01:52.235 --> 00:01:56.218
conducting local government;
they were the centers often of

00:01:56.218 --> 00:01:58.780
the exercise of political power.
 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:04.608
To give just one example,
at Pontefract Castle in the--

00:02:04.608 --> 00:02:07.180
more or less in the center of
the country in South Yorkshire,

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.788
up here--Pontefract Castle was
the home of Lord Darcy,

00:02:11.788 --> 00:02:17.020
and a list of his household as
it was in 1521 survives.

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.270
There were eighty people in
Darcy's household--

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.402
eighty: his family,
members of his extended family

00:02:24.402 --> 00:02:27.961
who lived with him,
his household and estate

00:02:27.961 --> 00:02:28.669
officers.
 

00:02:28.669 --> 00:02:33.007
He had living with him a bunch
of young men who were the sons

00:02:33.007 --> 00:02:37.199
of his clients amongst the local
gentry and numerous menial

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:38.139
servants.
 

00:02:38.139 --> 00:02:41.811
When he was called by Henry
VIII to go to war against the

00:02:41.811 --> 00:02:45.810
Scots in 1523 he took with him
twenty-three young men who were

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.220
members of his household as his
personal guard,

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.840
wearing his livery.
 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.839
So such people as Lord Darcy
had a style of life to maintain

00:02:56.839 --> 00:03:01.668
which necessarily elaborated
their domestic establishments

00:03:01.668 --> 00:03:05.990
and these were the great
households of the age.

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:10.157
Those of lesser people were of
course much smaller and much

00:03:10.157 --> 00:03:11.378
less elaborate.
 

00:03:11.378 --> 00:03:14.568
Usually, basically they were
nuclear family households--

00:03:14.568 --> 00:03:17.141
husband, wife,
and children,

00:03:17.141 --> 00:03:21.810
rarely co-resident relatives
living with them--

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.038
and that's a matter of some
significance.

00:03:24.038 --> 00:03:28.077
It reflects the common cultural
assumption that every newly

00:03:28.077 --> 00:03:32.323
married couple should set up its
own independent household and

00:03:32.323 --> 00:03:36.430
indeed that you should not marry
until you could do so;

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.300
you should not cohabit with
your relatives.

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.330
Well, in many ways that sounds
very modern,

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.458
but one mustn't forget that a
large minority of households in

00:03:46.458 --> 00:03:49.949
this period,
although their central core was

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:53.563
a nuclear family,
were also much larger than

00:03:53.563 --> 00:03:57.849
average not because they had
kinsfolk living with them but

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:02.134
because they came to include
people who were linked to the

00:04:02.134 --> 00:04:06.120
household not by blood or birth
but by contract;

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.378
servants, apprentices.
 

00:04:10.378 --> 00:04:14.168
So if sixteenth-century
households look familiar in some

00:04:14.168 --> 00:04:16.831
ways,
a large minority of them were

00:04:16.831 --> 00:04:20.839
also very different and one
could say they differed from

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:24.410
modern households in three
essential respects.

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:27.814
They differed structurally in
that a substantial number of

00:04:27.814 --> 00:04:31.699
them contained people affiliated
to the household by contract,

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:33.899
the servants and apprentices.
 

00:04:33.899 --> 00:04:38.117
They differed conceptually in
that when people talked about

00:04:38.117 --> 00:04:42.699
their family in this period they
meant not their immediate blood

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:45.100
relatives as we use the term.
 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:47.860
They meant all members of their
household.

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.406
Servants and apprentices were
regarded as members of their

00:04:50.406 --> 00:04:53.519
family;
they referred to them as family.

00:04:53.519 --> 00:04:55.540
So they're different
conceptually.

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:58.846
And they're also different
functionally because these

00:04:58.846 --> 00:05:02.598
people were usually taken on for
reasons which go beyond the

00:05:02.598 --> 00:05:05.269
usual functions of a modern
household.

00:05:05.269 --> 00:05:10.035
Whereas we tend to think of a
household as a unit of residence

00:05:10.035 --> 00:05:12.848
and consumption,
child rearing,

00:05:12.848 --> 00:05:16.360
and provision of emotional
support--

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.600
all of that was true in the
sixteenth century too--

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.721
but the household in the
sixteenth century also had more

00:05:21.721 --> 00:05:24.673
extensive functions which we
don't associate with the

00:05:24.673 --> 00:05:25.810
household today.
 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:28.750
They were units of production.
 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:29.939
They were farms.
 

00:05:29.939 --> 00:05:31.399
They were workshops.
 

00:05:31.399 --> 00:05:35.045
They were also places of
education and training where the

00:05:35.045 --> 00:05:37.779
young were trained in particular
tasks,

00:05:37.779 --> 00:05:42.730
and that's what I mean when I
say they were geared for work

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:46.230
for all this larger range of
functions.

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:46.773
Right.
 

00:05:46.773 --> 00:05:51.396
Well, as working units and as
units of residence all

00:05:51.396 --> 00:05:56.019
households were also spheres of
interdependence.

00:05:56.019 --> 00:05:59.507
Their maintenance and their
survival depended on the

00:05:59.507 --> 00:06:02.040
contributions of all their
members.

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:05.812
As we saw last time,
this was in its ideology a

00:06:05.812 --> 00:06:10.163
patriarchal society,
of course, in the sense that

00:06:10.163 --> 00:06:15.355
authority was conventionally
located in the persons of adult

00:06:15.355 --> 00:06:20.899
males in general and adult male
householders in particular,

00:06:20.899 --> 00:06:24.142
and these assumptions about the
structure of authority were also

00:06:24.142 --> 00:06:25.069
embodied in law.
 

00:06:25.069 --> 00:06:30.170
Remember the law of property I
mentioned last time with regard

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:31.089
to women.
 

00:06:31.089 --> 00:06:34.456
But despite these constraints
of ideology and law,

00:06:34.456 --> 00:06:38.577
women's role in the household
was of course indispensable and

00:06:38.577 --> 00:06:40.639
this was fully recognized.
 

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:43.728
It was the duty of the
householder to maintain his

00:06:43.728 --> 00:06:46.788
family by his labor,
to exercise his authority in

00:06:46.788 --> 00:06:50.418
managing its affairs,
to play a part in training

00:06:50.418 --> 00:06:53.879
servants and apprentices and so
forth.

00:06:53.879 --> 00:06:57.598
The duty of the mistress of the
household was generally summed

00:06:57.598 --> 00:07:00.709
up in a contemporary word,
"huswifery."

00:07:00.709 --> 00:07:03.269
It's on your sheet.
 

00:07:03.269 --> 00:07:06.850
"Huswifery"
or "housewifery."

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:11.531
And that comprised a range of
activity very different from the

00:07:11.531 --> 00:07:15.370
modern notion of the housewife
or the homemaker.

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:18.689
It wasn't so focused on the
maintenance of the domestic

00:07:18.689 --> 00:07:19.550
environment.
 

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:21.769
Housing in this period was very
simple.

00:07:21.769 --> 00:07:26.788
Most people seem to have lived
in houses with two or three

00:07:26.788 --> 00:07:30.839
rooms and furnishing was
exceedingly sparse.

00:07:30.839 --> 00:07:34.642
When people died inventories of
their goods were drawn up and

00:07:34.642 --> 00:07:38.699
from them we can learn every
single possession that they had,

00:07:38.699 --> 00:07:43.333
and it's striking how sparse
domestic interiors were in this

00:07:43.333 --> 00:07:44.040
period.
 

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:47.170
To give you one example,
a craftsman from Lincolnshire,

00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:49.906
which is up here,
who died in 1540:

00:07:49.906 --> 00:07:54.733
his inventory survives and he
possessed only twenty-two items

00:07:54.733 --> 00:07:57.100
in all,
twenty-two items,

00:07:57.100 --> 00:08:01.464
and they were items connected
with the three basics of

00:08:01.464 --> 00:08:04.430
household life:
places to sleep,

00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:07.689
places to sit,
and things to eat with,

00:08:07.689 --> 00:08:13.302
horn spoons, wooden bowls;
twenty-two items in all,

00:08:13.302 --> 00:08:15.259
not untypical.
 

00:08:15.259 --> 00:08:19.348
So huswifery as they understood
it in the sixteenth century was

00:08:19.348 --> 00:08:23.107
concerned not so much with
managing a domestic environment

00:08:23.107 --> 00:08:26.403
as with managing the daily
consumption needs of the

00:08:26.403 --> 00:08:27.459
household.
 

00:08:27.459 --> 00:08:31.839
Food preparation of course was
central but also making and

00:08:31.839 --> 00:08:36.143
mending clothes and bedding and
general provision for the

00:08:36.143 --> 00:08:38.678
maintenance of the household.
 

00:08:38.678 --> 00:08:43.053
In 1523, a man called Anthony
Fitzherbert wrote a book called

00:08:43.053 --> 00:08:47.648
The Book of Husbandry and
in it he describes the domestic

00:08:47.648 --> 00:08:51.493
tasks of a rural woman,
and what he describes is a

00:08:51.493 --> 00:08:55.378
myriad of activities involving
the self-provisioning of a

00:08:55.378 --> 00:08:58.638
household at this time:
keeping the pigs and the

00:08:58.638 --> 00:09:01.100
poultry,
running the dairy,

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:04.725
growing hemp and flax,
spinning it into yarn for

00:09:04.725 --> 00:09:08.438
making the linen for the family,
preparing the wool clip,

00:09:08.438 --> 00:09:11.730
laboring in the fields and in
the barn when needed,

00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:13.860
and marketing.
 

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:16.914
Women seem to have taken care
of most of the regular marketing

00:09:16.914 --> 00:09:19.168
of the produce of the household:
the eggs,

00:09:19.168 --> 00:09:21.732
the poultry,
the pigs, the grain,

00:09:21.732 --> 00:09:25.657
and of course buying
necessities which couldn't be

00:09:25.657 --> 00:09:27.340
produced at home.
 

00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:30.765
In the households of urban
craftsmen and tradesmen,

00:09:30.765 --> 00:09:33.850
things were a little
differently organized.

00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:37.307
Women were formally excluded
from the apprenticeship which

00:09:37.307 --> 00:09:40.340
would enable them to learn one
of these trades,

00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:44.355
but very often they learned
many aspects of it informally

00:09:44.355 --> 00:09:48.229
and the records reveal many
glimpses of women active in

00:09:48.229 --> 00:09:51.600
various aspects of their
husbands' trades,

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:54.230
assisting their husbands as
bakers and butchers,

00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:57.732
carrying water and sand for
husbands who were in the

00:09:57.732 --> 00:10:00.799
building trade,
buying raw materials on their

00:10:00.799 --> 00:10:05.178
husbands' behalf,
selling the finished goods and

00:10:05.178 --> 00:10:06.240
so forth.
 

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:07.480
How do we know about things
like this?

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:11.293
Well, lots of records that
survive from the many courts

00:10:11.293 --> 00:10:15.176
which governed many aspects of
local life give us little

00:10:15.176 --> 00:10:17.860
glimpses of what people are
doing.

00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:21.528
We know that women in one
city--well,

00:10:21.528 --> 00:10:24.687
in Norwich actually--might be
down at the water side buying

00:10:24.687 --> 00:10:27.466
wood for husbands who were
carpenters because on one

00:10:27.466 --> 00:10:30.788
occasion a fight broke out and
what they were doing happens to

00:10:30.788 --> 00:10:32.639
be described in the records.
 

00:10:32.639 --> 00:10:37.259
You get these kinds of glimpses
of people's activities.

00:10:37.259 --> 00:10:40.885
The wives of laboring men were
less able to participate in the

00:10:40.885 --> 00:10:44.631
household-based production of a
craftsman's family because their

00:10:44.631 --> 00:10:47.070
households were not productive
units.

00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:50.616
They went out to work for
others, but you also find these

00:10:50.616 --> 00:10:53.975
women engaged in all kinds of
wage labor to make their

00:10:53.975 --> 00:10:56.509
contribution to the domestic
budget.

00:10:56.509 --> 00:10:59.538
They might do seasonal
agricultural labor.

00:10:59.538 --> 00:11:02.813
You might find them spinning
for wages, producing the yarn

00:11:02.813 --> 00:11:04.250
for the cloth industry.
 

00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:07.782
They took in sewing and
knitting and washing and all

00:11:07.782 --> 00:11:10.899
kinds of other activities
outside the home.

00:11:10.899 --> 00:11:13.628
In the city of Chester,
up here in the northwest,

00:11:13.628 --> 00:11:15.958
for example,
at the docks they had a crane

00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:18.120
which was operated by a
treadmill.

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:21.912
Someone had to stand inside a
wheel and tread it to make it

00:11:21.912 --> 00:11:24.070
turn to make the crane operate.
 

00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:25.769
Who was inside the wheel?
 

00:11:25.769 --> 00:11:27.690
Women.
 

00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:31.928
You also find many women
engaged in various forms of

00:11:31.928 --> 00:11:33.259
petty dealing.
 

00:11:33.259 --> 00:11:37.129
One glimpse survives of a woman
called Rose, Rose Hearst.

00:11:37.129 --> 00:11:40.538
She lived in Maldon on the
coast of county of Essex,

00:11:40.538 --> 00:11:45.327
and we learn that twice a week
on market day she went fifteen

00:11:45.327 --> 00:11:48.759
miles to the county town to sell
oysters.

00:11:48.759 --> 00:11:49.950
I hope she had a pony.
 

00:11:49.950 --> 00:11:50.960
&gt;
 

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:55.019
Carrying a basket of oysters
fifteen miles would be no joke.

00:11:55.019 --> 00:11:58.629
But Rose Hearst sold oysters
twice a week.

00:11:58.629 --> 00:12:02.562
So overall women's tasks
extended well beyond the

00:12:02.562 --> 00:12:06.167
domestic sphere to include a
host of forms of

00:12:06.167 --> 00:12:10.346
self-provisioning or
supplementary earning according

00:12:10.346 --> 00:12:15.178
to the circumstances of
different kinds of household.

00:12:15.178 --> 00:12:19.318
The mix would vary,
but the common characteristic

00:12:19.318 --> 00:12:24.062
of their gender role was
flexibility and adaptability in

00:12:24.062 --> 00:12:26.649
what was expected of them.
 

00:12:26.649 --> 00:12:30.196
Mary Prior, who's written an
excellent article on women's

00:12:30.196 --> 00:12:32.350
work in this period,
sums it up.

00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:37.625
She says, "what men did
was definite,

00:12:37.625 --> 00:12:41.100
well defined and limited.
 

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:45.418
What women did was everything
else."

00:12:45.418 --> 00:12:47.210
In a way that's slightly unfair
to men.

00:12:47.210 --> 00:12:52.769
They worked very hard too,
but it's essentially true.

00:12:52.769 --> 00:12:56.716
Well, this constant round of
duties of huswifery were

00:12:56.716 --> 00:13:00.210
conducted in the context of a
further role,

00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:04.606
women's reproductive role,
which is worth dwelling on a

00:13:04.606 --> 00:13:05.340
little.
 

00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:09.144
Most couples in this period got
married in their mid- to late-

00:13:09.144 --> 00:13:09.830
twenties.
 

00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:14.062
They married relatively late
when they were ready to set up

00:13:14.062 --> 00:13:15.668
their own household.
 

00:13:15.668 --> 00:13:18.808
Historical demographers who
researched the parish registers,

00:13:18.808 --> 00:13:21.453
which give us the details of
people's marriages and the

00:13:21.453 --> 00:13:23.558
baptisms of their children and
so forth,

00:13:23.558 --> 00:13:27.464
they've revealed that the
average woman could expect to

00:13:27.464 --> 00:13:31.730
have her first child within
eighteen months of marriage,

00:13:31.730 --> 00:13:35.681
and she could then expect on
average to have another child at

00:13:35.681 --> 00:13:39.500
intervals of two to three years
for the rest of her fertile

00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:43.259
life,
if she lived that long.

00:13:43.259 --> 00:13:44.129
Think about it.
 

00:13:44.129 --> 00:13:48.120
That means that the average
woman in sixteenth-century

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:52.488
England was pregnant for a
quarter to a third of her entire

00:13:52.488 --> 00:13:57.081
adult life and that they were
constantly besieged by the needs

00:13:57.081 --> 00:13:58.889
of small children.
 

00:13:58.889 --> 00:14:01.985
These births being spaced
across an entire adult life

00:14:01.985 --> 00:14:05.498
meant that when some children
were teenagers and ready to go

00:14:05.498 --> 00:14:09.190
out into service others were
still toddlers and so forth--

00:14:09.190 --> 00:14:12.200
constant demands of small
children.

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:15.510
So it's not surprising that,
as Thomas Tusser said in the

00:14:15.510 --> 00:14:19.090
mid sixteenth century,
"huswives' affairs have

00:14:19.090 --> 00:14:22.639
never none ende"--
"huswives' affairs have

00:14:22.639 --> 00:14:25.976
never none ende"--
and despite their legal

00:14:25.976 --> 00:14:30.530
subordination it was of course
on the performance of these

00:14:30.530 --> 00:14:34.311
complex roles--
adapted to circumstances--that

00:14:34.311 --> 00:14:38.447
women's standing as individuals
depended amongst their

00:14:38.447 --> 00:14:41.493
neighbors,
within their families,

00:14:41.493 --> 00:14:46.644
and from the performance of
these roles doubtless that they

00:14:46.644 --> 00:14:49.220
derived their self-esteem.
 

00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:51.889
Well, in an agriculturally
dominated,

00:14:51.889 --> 00:14:55.506
labor-intensive,
low-productivity,

00:14:55.506 --> 00:15:00.769
pre-mechanized and
pre-contraceptive age it could

00:15:00.769 --> 00:15:05.764
hardly be otherwise,
and for the same reasons

00:15:05.764 --> 00:15:10.178
children were expected to play
their part too.

00:15:10.178 --> 00:15:13.116
Only a small minority of
children would have formal

00:15:13.116 --> 00:15:15.350
schooling in the sixteenth
century--

00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:20.720
it's been estimated perhaps 10%
in the early sixteenth century.

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:26.277
Most children would learn their
life skills practically at home

00:15:26.277 --> 00:15:31.386
or as servants and they were
expected to begin that and to

00:15:31.386 --> 00:15:36.317
participate in the domestic
economy as soon as they were

00:15:36.317 --> 00:15:38.110
able to do so.
 

00:15:38.110 --> 00:15:43.120
That may sound exploitative but
one mustn't exaggerate.

00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:46.323
Such participation was an
essential part of their

00:15:46.323 --> 00:15:50.529
education for life and children
tended to be introduced to tasks

00:15:50.529 --> 00:15:52.399
at an appropriate stage.
 

00:15:52.399 --> 00:15:55.620
There's also plenty of evidence
of them playing,

00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:59.418
but from the age of about seven
or eight you find them regularly

00:15:59.418 --> 00:16:02.191
engaged in tasks that they were
able to manage:

00:16:02.191 --> 00:16:05.475
herding sheep and cows,
reaping, gathering fuel,

00:16:05.475 --> 00:16:07.960
fetching and carrying,
picking fruit,

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:11.990
scaring birds in the fields,
and so on and so forth.

00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:17.022
There's a remarkable study by
Barbara Hanawalt of Ohio State

00:16:17.022 --> 00:16:20.778
University of children,
children's working activities

00:16:20.778 --> 00:16:23.860
in this period which is based on
the records of coroners.

00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:28.442
When someone died an untimely
death it had to be investigated

00:16:28.442 --> 00:16:32.730
by the coroner just as today;
they already had that system.

00:16:32.730 --> 00:16:36.125
And the records of coroners
which survive which deal with

00:16:36.125 --> 00:16:39.822
the deaths of children reveal
what they were doing at the time

00:16:39.822 --> 00:16:43.399
that they suffered an accident
leading to their death,

00:16:43.399 --> 00:16:46.553
and so you can look at this and
you have their age and you can

00:16:46.553 --> 00:16:48.519
see what tasks they were engaged
in.

00:16:48.519 --> 00:16:51.135
So for example,
a little boy is helping his

00:16:51.135 --> 00:16:54.687
father to cut down a tree when
the ax head strikes him and

00:16:54.687 --> 00:16:57.839
sadly he's killed,
or a little girl is fetching

00:16:57.839 --> 00:17:01.340
water when she falls down a well
and so on and so forth.

00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:05.067
From evidence like this an
imaginative historian can

00:17:05.067 --> 00:17:08.796
reconstruct the way in which
children were gradually

00:17:08.796 --> 00:17:11.720
introduced in to their working
life.

00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:15.321
Sustained, repetitive labor of
the kind we associate with

00:17:15.321 --> 00:17:18.410
exploitative child labor was
relatively rare--

00:17:18.410 --> 00:17:21.104
though it existed,
especially in the areas which

00:17:21.104 --> 00:17:23.568
were heavily involved in the
cloth trade.

00:17:23.568 --> 00:17:27.433
That's where you find children
carding wool,

00:17:27.433 --> 00:17:30.220
spinning wool for long hours.
 

00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:33.590
So the household in the
sixteenth century was a unit

00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:37.357
geared for work and its members'
roles varied according to

00:17:37.357 --> 00:17:41.192
contemporary ideas and values
regarding the proper roles of

00:17:41.192 --> 00:17:45.890
men,
women and children.

00:17:45.890 --> 00:17:50.721
So let's turn now to the
priorities of households and the

00:17:50.721 --> 00:17:54.259
strategies by which they
achieved them.

00:17:54.259 --> 00:18:00.848
Well, the first priority
obviously enough was survival.

00:18:00.848 --> 00:18:04.486
That meant maintaining the flow
of resources on which the

00:18:04.486 --> 00:18:05.849
household depended.
 

00:18:05.849 --> 00:18:07.720
Today that would be your salary.
 

00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:12.597
In the sixteenth century it
meant various combinations of

00:18:12.597 --> 00:18:17.738
self-provisioning on one hand
and engaging in markets on the

00:18:17.738 --> 00:18:18.608
other.
 

00:18:18.608 --> 00:18:22.750
Most rural households were
still heavily weighted towards

00:18:22.750 --> 00:18:25.710
providing their own basic
subsistence.

00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:29.486
It was still essentially a
subsistence economy of small

00:18:29.486 --> 00:18:33.751
producers relying primarily on
family labor and consuming most

00:18:33.751 --> 00:18:36.618
of their produce in their own
houses.

00:18:36.618 --> 00:18:42.519
Of course, that would vary
regionally and socially.

00:18:42.519 --> 00:18:45.635
In most areas there was a
minority of those large yeoman

00:18:45.635 --> 00:18:47.450
farmers I mentioned last time.
 

00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:52.055
They were attuned to supplying
medium- to long-distance markets

00:18:52.055 --> 00:18:55.950
with agricultural produce,
provisioning the towns and so

00:18:55.950 --> 00:18:58.186
forth,
and they were producers on a

00:18:58.186 --> 00:19:01.200
substantial scale heavily
engaged in marketing.

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:05.250
But it's been estimated by the
agricultural historian Mark

00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:09.019
Overton that about 80% of
English farming in the early

00:19:09.019 --> 00:19:13.425
sixteenth century was actually
oriented towards the subsistence

00:19:13.425 --> 00:19:17.336
of the farm family itself and
only a small part of their

00:19:17.336 --> 00:19:19.538
produce being marketed.
 

00:19:19.538 --> 00:19:23.386
Well, whether the flow of
household resources depended on

00:19:23.386 --> 00:19:27.715
self-provisioning or on selling
in the market it provided people

00:19:27.715 --> 00:19:31.288
with their living and often
quite a bare living.

00:19:31.288 --> 00:19:36.213
Overton, whom I mentioned,
has also calculated the incomes

00:19:36.213 --> 00:19:40.618
that could be expected by
farmers in this period.

00:19:40.618 --> 00:19:44.441
A big yeoman who had a hundred
acres of land growing wheat

00:19:44.441 --> 00:19:48.328
could not only feed his family
but would probably earn,

00:19:48.328 --> 00:19:51.509
Overton reckons,
about seventy pounds a year--

00:19:51.509 --> 00:19:55.470
quite a substantial
income--from his production.

00:19:55.470 --> 00:19:58.704
On the other hand,
a small husbandman with only

00:19:58.704 --> 00:20:03.066
about ten acres would probably
have only enough left to sell to

00:20:03.066 --> 00:20:06.019
yield him two or three pounds a
year--

00:20:06.019 --> 00:20:10.798
so an enormous difference in
the cash income that they could

00:20:10.798 --> 00:20:11.690
generate.
 

00:20:11.690 --> 00:20:15.765
So for many of these families,
the smaller husbandmen,

00:20:15.765 --> 00:20:20.608
they had a fairly narrow margin
and that was in normal times.

00:20:20.608 --> 00:20:25.311
These estimates have to be
transformed when you get the

00:20:25.311 --> 00:20:27.490
event of a bad harvest.
 

00:20:27.490 --> 00:20:30.150
If the harvest failed a big
farmer,

00:20:30.150 --> 00:20:32.747
a big yeoman farmer,
would still be able to feed his

00:20:32.747 --> 00:20:35.650
family and prices would shoot up
because of shortages,

00:20:35.650 --> 00:20:38.500
so he might still make a
considerable income.

00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:41.344
But in such circumstances the
small farmer might not be able

00:20:41.344 --> 00:20:44.333
to feed his own family;
he might fall behind on his

00:20:44.333 --> 00:20:47.145
rent;
he might have to buy grain in

00:20:47.145 --> 00:20:49.730
the market at inflated prices.
 

00:20:49.730 --> 00:20:51.980
It could be a disastrous
circumstance.

00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:56.038
And for landless wage earners
it could be even harder.

00:20:56.038 --> 00:20:59.625
They didn't produce their own
food, they would have to buy it

00:20:59.625 --> 00:21:00.940
at very high prices.
 

00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:05.872
Well, bad years like that were
relatively rare but they were

00:21:05.872 --> 00:21:07.210
unpredictable.
 

00:21:07.210 --> 00:21:10.671
In the 1520s,
there were two very bad years

00:21:10.671 --> 00:21:11.660
like that.
 

00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:14.440
In the 1550s, there were three.
 

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:17.743
There was another run of very
bad harvests in the 1590s and so

00:21:17.743 --> 00:21:18.720
one could go on.
 

00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:20.630
It was one of the hazards of
life.

00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:24.868
One can understand why people
sometimes in the diaries that

00:21:24.868 --> 00:21:29.036
they left behind them are
looking anxiously at the weather

00:21:29.036 --> 00:21:31.230
as the harvest approaches.
 

00:21:31.230 --> 00:21:35.828
Other sources of insecurity
could be equally unpredictable.

00:21:35.828 --> 00:21:41.650
The high mortality rates of the
period could pose a real threat.

00:21:41.650 --> 00:21:46.438
The worst circumstances would
be the outbreak of an epidemic,

00:21:46.438 --> 00:21:49.630
usually an epidemic of bubonic
plague.

00:21:49.630 --> 00:21:54.387
When an epidemic hit a city,
as they periodically did,

00:21:54.387 --> 00:21:59.953
you might get 20 or 30% of the
entire population dying within a

00:21:59.953 --> 00:22:01.838
period of months.
 

00:22:01.838 --> 00:22:04.743
The city of York,
the greatest city of the north

00:22:04.743 --> 00:22:08.587
of England--
up here --York suffered no

00:22:08.587 --> 00:22:15.462
fewer than seven epidemics of
bubonic plague between 1485 and

00:22:15.462 --> 00:22:16.380
1550.
 

00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:21.492
So this was another hazard of
life which would periodically

00:22:21.492 --> 00:22:26.430
strike, devastating the
households that were infected.

00:22:26.430 --> 00:22:29.016
Besides epidemics,
though, there was also the

00:22:29.016 --> 00:22:32.602
constant threat of infectious
diseases which nowadays would be

00:22:32.602 --> 00:22:35.660
cleared up in a matter of days
with antibiotics.

00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:42.759
This meant that death rates
were fairly high for adults.

00:22:42.759 --> 00:22:46.789
Very few people lived 'til
sixty, and also you have the

00:22:46.789 --> 00:22:51.417
hazards of death in childbed for
women and of course accidental

00:22:51.417 --> 00:22:52.240
deaths.
 

00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:57.776
These threats could hit the
prosperous and the poor alike

00:22:57.776 --> 00:23:03.412
and the accident of death at a
bad moment in any household

00:23:03.412 --> 00:23:07.170
could prove absolutely
disastrous.

00:23:07.170 --> 00:23:10.470
This was a period that had no
life insurance.

00:23:10.470 --> 00:23:16.113
It was a period which had no
pensions for those who were left

00:23:16.113 --> 00:23:16.960
behind.
 

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:20.134
Average life expectation at
birth in the sixteenth century

00:23:20.134 --> 00:23:22.029
was actually about thirty-three.
 

00:23:22.029 --> 00:23:23.900
That's average.
 

00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:27.278
If you made it to twenty,
you would probably live 'til

00:23:27.278 --> 00:23:30.594
your forties but most people
died in their forties or

00:23:30.594 --> 00:23:31.359
fifties.
 

00:23:31.359 --> 00:23:33.390
Okay.
 

00:23:33.390 --> 00:23:36.596
All of these somber realities
add up to an environment of risk

00:23:36.596 --> 00:23:40.011
for the household,
threatening its viability and

00:23:40.011 --> 00:23:43.209
survival,
and that inevitably influenced

00:23:43.209 --> 00:23:44.910
people's mentalities.
 

00:23:44.910 --> 00:23:50.103
It's been suggested that people
in this period tended to value

00:23:50.103 --> 00:23:54.190
security and stability over
change and growth.

00:23:54.190 --> 00:23:59.327
Their economic strategies in
particular were often very

00:23:59.327 --> 00:24:05.037
defensive, designed to minimize
risks rather than to maximize

00:24:05.037 --> 00:24:06.750
opportunities.
 

00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:12.028
So, their first priority was
survival.

00:24:12.028 --> 00:24:15.196
The second major priority was
to provide for the future

00:24:15.196 --> 00:24:18.597
well-being of the members of the
household and their future

00:24:18.597 --> 00:24:20.779
capacity,
if they were young,

00:24:20.779 --> 00:24:24.932
to be able to form and sustain
households of their own when

00:24:24.932 --> 00:24:27.509
they reached the appropriate
age.

00:24:27.509 --> 00:24:31.288
And in this process there are
three crucial moments in the

00:24:31.288 --> 00:24:34.738
life of the household:
there's the 'putting forth' of

00:24:34.738 --> 00:24:37.588
children into the world as they
put it;

00:24:37.588 --> 00:24:40.930
there's marriage and the
arrangements associated with it;

00:24:40.930 --> 00:24:45.070
and there was the transmission
of property to the new

00:24:45.070 --> 00:24:47.700
generation through inheritance.
 

00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:51.567
These were all aspects of the
way in which households were

00:24:51.567 --> 00:24:53.058
gradually dispersed.
 

00:24:53.058 --> 00:24:56.028
Let's look first at the aspect
of dispersal involving young

00:24:56.028 --> 00:24:59.525
people,
their leaving home to enter the

00:24:59.525 --> 00:25:04.630
households of others as servants
and as apprentices.

00:25:04.630 --> 00:25:10.256
The institution of service was
well attuned to accommodating

00:25:10.256 --> 00:25:13.690
the needs of different
households.

00:25:13.690 --> 00:25:16.700
At any one point in time some
households,

00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:19.719
often the poorer ones,
would have children who were

00:25:19.719 --> 00:25:23.461
coming to an age at which they
were capable of a fuller working

00:25:23.461 --> 00:25:26.963
role but there wasn't really
enough to usefully employ them

00:25:26.963 --> 00:25:30.098
at home;
their labor wasn't needed.

00:25:30.098 --> 00:25:32.839
Other households,
however, would require

00:25:32.839 --> 00:25:36.212
additional labor either
temporarily because their

00:25:36.212 --> 00:25:39.303
children were young,
too young to work,

00:25:39.303 --> 00:25:43.376
or permanently because their
children had grown and left

00:25:43.376 --> 00:25:43.970
home.
 

00:25:43.970 --> 00:25:49.471
If you look at the back of your
handout you'll see a couple of

00:25:49.471 --> 00:25:53.348
examples of sixteenth-century
households.

00:25:53.348 --> 00:25:55.150
Now that's sixteenth-century
handwriting at the bottom.

00:25:55.150 --> 00:25:57.700
This is from a census which was
made.

00:25:57.700 --> 00:26:01.473
These are households of yeoman
farmers and you'll see that

00:26:01.473 --> 00:26:05.578
there are no children in those
households but there are lots of

00:26:05.578 --> 00:26:06.440
servants.
 

00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:08.338
Some of them are described as
husbandmen.

00:26:08.338 --> 00:26:12.493
They're farm workers living in
the household with these yeoman

00:26:12.493 --> 00:26:15.148
farmers and most of them,
as you'll see,

00:26:15.148 --> 00:26:18.848
are pretty young;
they're in their late teens or

00:26:18.848 --> 00:26:20.058
early twenties.
 

00:26:20.058 --> 00:26:24.759
That's what sixteenth-century
households of this particular

00:26:24.759 --> 00:26:27.190
type would have looked like.
 

00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:31.200
Well, the basic logic of the
system,

00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:34.223
then, was the transfer of
children from one household to

00:26:34.223 --> 00:26:37.806
another according to need,
but there was also more to it

00:26:37.806 --> 00:26:38.558
than that.
 

00:26:38.558 --> 00:26:42.670
Service was also a way in which
young people learned skills.

00:26:42.670 --> 00:26:46.548
It was a way in which they
gained experience and of course

00:26:46.548 --> 00:26:50.288
they earned a small wage which
they could often save.

00:26:50.288 --> 00:26:54.198
It also served to kind of
redistribute the young across an

00:26:54.198 --> 00:26:57.490
area from the village in which
they were born.

00:26:57.490 --> 00:27:03.085
They would move from master to
master around the area in which

00:27:03.085 --> 00:27:06.126
they lived,
and they would become familiar

00:27:06.126 --> 00:27:09.464
with the economic opportunities
available to them in their

00:27:09.464 --> 00:27:12.238
region--
gradually, when they reached

00:27:12.238 --> 00:27:16.093
sufficient age and maturity,
getting a notion of where they

00:27:16.093 --> 00:27:19.301
might settle permanently,
marry and set up their own

00:27:19.301 --> 00:27:20.130
households.
 

00:27:20.130 --> 00:27:23.119
They would often be hired
annually at the servant's hiring

00:27:23.119 --> 00:27:25.134
fair,
and there's been a very good

00:27:25.134 --> 00:27:28.606
study of a hiring fair done by a
woman called Ann Kussmaul who

00:27:28.606 --> 00:27:31.170
has written an excellent book on
servants.

00:27:31.170 --> 00:27:35.328
And she shows how you would
have a little town where the

00:27:35.328 --> 00:27:39.942
hiring fair was and servants who
might be placed in households

00:27:39.942 --> 00:27:44.328
scattered around the area would
come in to get hired,

00:27:44.328 --> 00:27:48.263
and then they might be hired by
a master which would take them

00:27:48.263 --> 00:27:51.875
out to the other side of the
particular catchment area of

00:27:51.875 --> 00:27:53.230
this hiring fair.
 

00:27:53.230 --> 00:27:56.940
So as year gave way to year
servants would be whizzing

00:27:56.940 --> 00:27:59.950
backwards and forwards around
this area,

00:27:59.950 --> 00:28:03.160
and she shows from year to year
how that happened,

00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:07.098
and then eventually they'd
settle.

00:28:07.098 --> 00:28:10.170
Well, a lot of this was
relevant to apprentices also,

00:28:10.170 --> 00:28:12.500
but with the apprenticeship
system,

00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:17.648
of course, the advantaging
mechanism and the skill training

00:28:17.648 --> 00:28:20.578
aspect was much more prominent.
 

00:28:20.578 --> 00:28:23.266
Families invested in the
children who went out as

00:28:23.266 --> 00:28:24.048
apprentices.
 

00:28:24.048 --> 00:28:27.765
They paid a fee to their
masters and they expected that

00:28:27.765 --> 00:28:29.767
in future,
when they had finished their

00:28:29.767 --> 00:28:32.819
apprenticeship,
they would set up as master

00:28:32.819 --> 00:28:34.759
craftsmen themselves.
 

00:28:34.759 --> 00:28:38.665
So service and apprenticeship
were the conventional ways of

00:28:38.665 --> 00:28:42.438
preparing young people for the
future assumption of adult

00:28:42.438 --> 00:28:46.732
responsibilities,
and for most of them that came

00:28:46.732 --> 00:28:48.140
with marriage.
 

00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:51.833
Marriage was the point at which
they were transformed into

00:28:51.833 --> 00:28:54.719
householders and,
like leaving home,

00:28:54.719 --> 00:28:59.930
it was a point of transition at
which individual desires and

00:28:59.930 --> 00:29:04.875
individual ambitions had to be
reconciled with the larger

00:29:04.875 --> 00:29:09.380
strategies of the households
they belonged to.

00:29:09.380 --> 00:29:13.700
The making of a marriage was
quite a complex process.

00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:18.441
It's left a lot of records and
quite a few excellent studies

00:29:18.441 --> 00:29:20.288
have been done of it.
 

00:29:20.288 --> 00:29:24.060
It was rarely simply a matter
of parents arranging the

00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:25.839
marriages of the young.
 

00:29:25.839 --> 00:29:27.710
That was certainly known.
 

00:29:27.710 --> 00:29:32.130
Parents were more than happy to
present potential candidates to

00:29:32.130 --> 00:29:36.123
their children and amongst the
aristocracy arrangement of

00:29:36.123 --> 00:29:39.759
matches amongst their children
was very common.

00:29:39.759 --> 00:29:43.102
These were families in which
marriage might have great social

00:29:43.102 --> 00:29:46.557
and political significance and
it was too important to leave to

00:29:46.557 --> 00:29:48.338
the young people themselves.
 

00:29:48.338 --> 00:29:52.332
But in general young people
were permitted a considerable

00:29:52.332 --> 00:29:56.038
degree of personal choice in
selecting their marriage

00:29:56.038 --> 00:30:00.602
partners provided they did so by
choosing within a pool of people

00:30:00.602 --> 00:30:05.108
who were considered acceptable;
that's to say a pool of

00:30:05.108 --> 00:30:10.230
eligible partners of appropriate
social and economic standing.

00:30:10.230 --> 00:30:12.210
They had an ideal of parity in
marriage;

00:30:12.210 --> 00:30:13.880
like married like.
 

00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:16.430
When they talk of a 'match'
they mean exactly that;

00:30:16.430 --> 00:30:19.068
they're matching social equals.
 

00:30:19.068 --> 00:30:22.517
And, whether the courtships
were initiated by the young

00:30:22.517 --> 00:30:25.771
people themselves or whether
they were responding to

00:30:25.771 --> 00:30:29.473
initiatives and suggestions
taken by their parents or their

00:30:29.473 --> 00:30:32.760
guardians,
the successful completion of a

00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:36.356
match was subject to what one
historian has called

00:30:36.356 --> 00:30:39.000
"multilateral
consent."

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.730
It's not a unilateral matter
for the young people alone.

00:30:41.730 --> 00:30:44.446
It's not a unilateral
arrangement by the parents

00:30:44.446 --> 00:30:44.910
alone.
 

00:30:44.910 --> 00:30:47.788
It's a matter of multilateral
consent,

00:30:47.788 --> 00:30:52.517
that is to say the agreement
and support of all interested

00:30:52.517 --> 00:30:55.711
parties,
notably their parents but also

00:30:55.711 --> 00:30:58.375
their close kin,
sometimes their brothers and

00:30:58.375 --> 00:31:02.598
sisters,
anyone who had an interest.

00:31:02.598 --> 00:31:06.212
That could--that kind of
influence could--sometimes be

00:31:06.212 --> 00:31:09.690
exerted quite sensitively,
but sometimes it could be

00:31:09.690 --> 00:31:11.598
asserted quite brutally.
 

00:31:11.598 --> 00:31:14.625
William Perkins,
the famous puritan preacher,

00:31:14.625 --> 00:31:18.891
advised one young woman who was
worried about the marriage that

00:31:18.891 --> 00:31:21.849
had been proposed to her by her
father.

00:31:21.849 --> 00:31:25.990
He advised her:
"thy virginity is not all

00:31:25.990 --> 00:31:27.910
thine to dispose of.
 

00:31:27.910 --> 00:31:30.089
In part it is thy parents.
 

00:31:30.089 --> 00:31:34.269
Thy father hath a stroke in it;
thy mother hath another,

00:31:34.269 --> 00:31:36.450
and kindred a third.
 

00:31:36.450 --> 00:31:42.463
Fight not against all,
but be his whom they would have

00:31:42.463 --> 00:31:43.940
thee."
 

00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:48.855
Well, in that case all that's
required of her is her consent,

00:31:48.855 --> 00:31:51.970
but it may have been very
unwilling.

00:31:51.970 --> 00:31:54.670
Among families that had little
or no property,

00:31:54.670 --> 00:32:00.028
agreement, or the 'good will',
as they often put it,

00:32:00.028 --> 00:32:04.078
of others was largely a matter
of simply moral force.

00:32:04.078 --> 00:32:08.250
Young people from the poorer
ranks had a good deal more

00:32:08.250 --> 00:32:09.950
freedom of movement.
 

00:32:09.950 --> 00:32:14.147
They provided for their own
independence largely from their

00:32:14.147 --> 00:32:16.900
own earnings and their own
savings,

00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:20.338
and often it took them years to
do so,

00:32:20.338 --> 00:32:26.019
but they were under less
pressure from their families.

00:32:26.019 --> 00:32:30.486
One young woman who was
preparing for her eventual

00:32:30.486 --> 00:32:35.864
independence was a young woman
called Isabel Fowler who died

00:32:35.864 --> 00:32:41.606
unmarried around about 1550 and
whose goods were listed when she

00:32:41.606 --> 00:32:42.608
died.
 

00:32:42.608 --> 00:32:44.710
She was still a servant at the
time.

00:32:44.710 --> 00:32:48.960
She had a chest,
and in her chest she had some

00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:54.058
clothes and some domestic
utensils and some bedding.

00:32:54.058 --> 00:32:57.826
Her master was holding three
pounds of accumulated wages for

00:32:57.826 --> 00:32:58.210
her.
 

00:32:58.210 --> 00:33:03.059
He was kind of acting as her
banker, and in addition she had

00:33:03.059 --> 00:33:07.910
three cows which her master was
allowing her to run with his

00:33:07.910 --> 00:33:08.650
herd.
 

00:33:08.650 --> 00:33:13.314
So Isabel was clearly sort of
getting it together for a

00:33:13.314 --> 00:33:16.769
potential marriage and sadly she
died;

00:33:16.769 --> 00:33:19.707
she never made it,
but she would have been a good

00:33:19.707 --> 00:33:20.869
catch if she had.
 

00:33:20.869 --> 00:33:22.778
&gt;
 

00:33:22.778 --> 00:33:26.807
Well, amongst people with
property whether they were small

00:33:26.807 --> 00:33:31.186
farmers or higher up the social
scale the economic arrangements

00:33:31.186 --> 00:33:33.660
were somewhat more complicated.
 

00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:37.691
One contemporary observer said,
"young folk be come

00:33:37.691 --> 00:33:41.210
together for love,
but parents must cast how they

00:33:41.210 --> 00:33:42.750
shall live."
 

00:33:42.750 --> 00:33:48.769
Together the two families would
provide a conjugal fund.

00:33:48.769 --> 00:33:52.029
The groom was expected--it was
expected that his family would

00:33:52.029 --> 00:33:55.019
help to provide a dwelling and a
means of livelihood.

00:33:55.019 --> 00:33:58.836
The bride would bring what was
called her 'portion',

00:33:58.836 --> 00:34:03.328
her portion of goods or money
or perhaps even land with which

00:34:03.328 --> 00:34:05.650
her family would endow her.
 

00:34:05.650 --> 00:34:09.983
These resources would be partly
accumulated by the young people

00:34:09.983 --> 00:34:14.246
but depended crucially at this
social level upon parental help

00:34:14.246 --> 00:34:18.230
through either inheritance or
transfers of property,

00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:21.639
and the sums involved could be
quite substantial.

00:34:21.639 --> 00:34:25.038
In 1500, for example,
one study shows that the

00:34:25.038 --> 00:34:29.418
portions which were given to
daughters of the gentry in the

00:34:29.418 --> 00:34:32.273
county of Kent,
which is down here in the

00:34:32.273 --> 00:34:36.480
southeast,
averaged around 280 pounds.

00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:39.291
It was quite a lot of money in
the early sixteenth century

00:34:39.291 --> 00:34:42.349
which these gentry families had
to find for their daughters.

00:34:42.349 --> 00:34:47.567
Villagers in the same county,
of course, provided much lower

00:34:47.567 --> 00:34:52.518
sums but it could range up to
twenty or thirty pounds.

00:34:52.518 --> 00:34:55.815
But, whatever the level,
settling these matches involved

00:34:55.815 --> 00:34:59.469
some pretty hard bargaining
amongst the families concerned.

00:34:59.469 --> 00:35:02.139
There's a lot of evidence of
the way in which people

00:35:02.139 --> 00:35:04.599
calculated what their families
could afford,

00:35:04.599 --> 00:35:08.498
how the families of the bride
and groom hammered it out and

00:35:08.498 --> 00:35:12.318
negotiated over the portions,
and all of this of course had

00:35:12.318 --> 00:35:15.599
its implications for the younger
children in the family.

00:35:15.599 --> 00:35:17.239
What would be left for them?
 

00:35:17.239 --> 00:35:18.559
They had a say.
 

00:35:18.559 --> 00:35:21.731
And they also needed to
calculate what the family could

00:35:21.731 --> 00:35:25.018
afford if it was to remain
itself viable economically.

00:35:25.018 --> 00:35:28.905
So it involved a lot of
strategic thinking when a

00:35:28.905 --> 00:35:32.188
marriage was proposed,
and if all of that was

00:35:32.188 --> 00:35:35.110
successfully resolved a match
would be concluded,

00:35:35.110 --> 00:35:39.750
a new household would be
established and endowed.

00:35:39.750 --> 00:35:44.273
If not, the denial of parental
support could be catastrophic

00:35:44.273 --> 00:35:48.489
for the marriage hopes of the
young people concerned.

00:35:48.489 --> 00:35:51.230
If these things interest you,
I recommend in particular a

00:35:51.230 --> 00:35:53.188
book on the reading list by
Diana O'Hara,

00:35:53.188 --> 00:35:54.949
Courtship and
Constraint.

00:35:54.949 --> 00:36:00.730
It's a wonderful study of
sixteenth-century courtship.

00:36:00.730 --> 00:36:04.315
Well, putting your children
forth as adolescents and then

00:36:04.315 --> 00:36:07.773
matchmaking at the time of
marriage were also linked in

00:36:07.773 --> 00:36:11.039
different ways to the question
of inheritance,

00:36:11.039 --> 00:36:15.152
the way in which resources were
transferred between the

00:36:15.152 --> 00:36:16.219
generations.
 

00:36:16.219 --> 00:36:20.146
It's generally true to say that
sixteenth-century English

00:36:20.146 --> 00:36:24.085
society favored primogeniture,
the lion's share going--of the

00:36:24.085 --> 00:36:28.570
family property--
going to the eldest son.

00:36:28.570 --> 00:36:31.730
But they also believed that an
equitable provision should be

00:36:31.730 --> 00:36:34.807
made for younger children;
they should receive some

00:36:34.807 --> 00:36:37.900
portion of goods to help them
into adult life.

00:36:37.900 --> 00:36:42.396
One Tudor lawyer said that in
his view "a good and

00:36:42.396 --> 00:36:47.059
natural loving father"
would exercise "care and

00:36:47.059 --> 00:36:51.139
providence to advance every of
his children,

00:36:51.139 --> 00:36:55.967
according to his ability,
with a portion of living or

00:36:55.967 --> 00:36:57.639
substance".
 

00:36:57.639 --> 00:37:01.724
And nor was it a matter for the
fathers alone because if they

00:37:01.724 --> 00:37:05.742
laid down in their wills the
division of their goods amongst

00:37:05.742 --> 00:37:09.420
their children it's also very
clear that the successful

00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:13.369
completion of these family
strategies usually depended upon

00:37:13.369 --> 00:37:17.659
the sustaining of the household
economy after the father's death

00:37:17.659 --> 00:37:19.429
by their widows.
 

00:37:19.429 --> 00:37:23.755
It was usual in people's wills
for the widow to be named

00:37:23.755 --> 00:37:28.552
executor with full control of
the family property until either

00:37:28.552 --> 00:37:32.880
her death or the age of majority
of the eldest son.

00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:37.929
It was simply assumed that
these women had the experience

00:37:37.929 --> 00:37:42.440
and the capability to do all
that was required,

00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:47.090
and that leads us to a final
aspect of the household,

00:37:47.090 --> 00:37:55.987
the question of authority and
power within this structure of

00:37:55.987 --> 00:37:58.400
relationships.
 

00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:03.336
All of the household strategies
that I've been talking about had

00:38:03.336 --> 00:38:07.255
a certain sort of collective
element you could say,

00:38:07.255 --> 00:38:09.530
the quality of jointness.
 

00:38:09.530 --> 00:38:13.530
The interests of the different
individuals intersect.

00:38:13.530 --> 00:38:18.074
You have to accommodate the
collective interest of the

00:38:18.074 --> 00:38:23.561
household as a unit with that of
the individuals who comprised it

00:38:23.561 --> 00:38:28.449
and had their own expectations
and perhaps ambitions.

00:38:28.449 --> 00:38:33.009
But one might well ask whether
decision making within

00:38:33.009 --> 00:38:35.989
households was truly collective.
 

00:38:35.989 --> 00:38:40.567
Households, like society in
general, were organized on a

00:38:40.567 --> 00:38:44.230
principle of hierarchical
differentiation.

00:38:44.230 --> 00:38:48.525
People's duties and people's
entitlements were conceived of

00:38:48.525 --> 00:38:52.599
in accordance with their place
within that hierarchy.

00:38:52.599 --> 00:38:54.650
The household economy,
as we've seen,

00:38:54.650 --> 00:38:59.324
involved interdependence,
it involved complementary

00:38:59.324 --> 00:39:01.579
effort,
but the contributions of

00:39:01.579 --> 00:39:04.000
members were not necessary of
equal weight;

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:09.556
they weren't necessarily of
equal value in contemporary

00:39:09.556 --> 00:39:10.380
views.
 

00:39:10.380 --> 00:39:14.309
One could say that in many ways
the household was,

00:39:14.309 --> 00:39:18.251
in a sense, a sphere of
altruism in which the interests

00:39:18.251 --> 00:39:21.389
of others were taken into
consideration,

00:39:21.389 --> 00:39:26.297
but at the same time there
could be clashes of personality

00:39:26.297 --> 00:39:30.429
and there could be competition
over resources.

00:39:30.429 --> 00:39:34.128
The law and contemporary
ideology left no doubt about

00:39:34.128 --> 00:39:38.039
where ultimate authority lay in
managing all of this.

00:39:38.039 --> 00:39:42.150
It lay of course with the
household head.

00:39:42.150 --> 00:39:46.255
But it's equally apparent when
one has glimpses of households

00:39:46.255 --> 00:39:50.155
in action that the personal
dynamics of the household were

00:39:50.155 --> 00:39:53.440
often far more complex than that
stereotype.

00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:57.751
We have the stereotype of
uncontested patriarchal

00:39:57.751 --> 00:39:58.920
domination.
 

00:39:58.920 --> 00:40:03.929
The reality turns out to be far
more variegated.

00:40:03.929 --> 00:40:07.530
The fact that women were
subordinated as a sex didn't

00:40:07.530 --> 00:40:10.510
preclude recognition of their
competence;

00:40:10.510 --> 00:40:14.699
it didn't preclude recognition
of their judgment.

00:40:14.699 --> 00:40:17.985
Such qualities were expected of
them and they were daily

00:40:17.985 --> 00:40:21.690
displayed in the conduct of
household affairs as we've seen.

00:40:21.690 --> 00:40:24.510
Accordingly,
you find in the evidence that

00:40:24.510 --> 00:40:28.641
wives were very often far from
being the silent spectators of

00:40:28.641 --> 00:40:32.219
the decisions that were made
regarding their family's

00:40:32.219 --> 00:40:33.389
well-being.
 

00:40:33.389 --> 00:40:38.282
The evidence of matchmaking
shows that they had a very real

00:40:38.282 --> 00:40:43.514
voice in either negotiating the
terms of the marriages of their

00:40:43.514 --> 00:40:48.829
children or in opposing or
approving particular candidates.

00:40:48.829 --> 00:40:52.358
The evidence we have regarding
the making of people's wills

00:40:52.358 --> 00:40:55.280
shows that women were often
heavily involved,

00:40:55.280 --> 00:40:59.592
advising their husbands on the
terms of their wills and

00:40:59.592 --> 00:41:02.309
sometimes indeed disputing them.
 

00:41:02.309 --> 00:41:05.065
They were the ones who would
ultimately have to administer

00:41:05.065 --> 00:41:08.110
and execute those wills and they
had a voice in their making.

00:41:08.110 --> 00:41:12.315
And they appear elsewhere
making their voices heard and

00:41:12.315 --> 00:41:14.420
indeed being listened to.
 

00:41:14.420 --> 00:41:19.072
Outside the context of the
household most women could of

00:41:19.072 --> 00:41:22.710
course exercise little public
authority,

00:41:22.710 --> 00:41:27.501
but within it they clearly had
a recognized role and that

00:41:27.501 --> 00:41:31.864
recognized role conferred
certain rights and certain

00:41:31.864 --> 00:41:33.320
entitlements.
 

00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:36.940
Anthony Fitzherbert in The
Book of Husbandry advised

00:41:36.940 --> 00:41:40.375
that both wife and husband
should from time to time make

00:41:40.375 --> 00:41:42.623
what he called
"reckonings"

00:41:42.623 --> 00:41:44.059
with one another.
 

00:41:44.059 --> 00:41:46.603
He was thinking of their
economic activities,

00:41:46.603 --> 00:41:49.552
that they should make
reckonings of their activities

00:41:49.552 --> 00:41:51.750
with one another,
and he went on:

00:41:51.750 --> 00:41:57.673
"for if one of them should
use to deceive the other he

00:41:57.673 --> 00:42:02.679
deceiveth himself and is not
likely to thrive,

00:42:02.679 --> 00:42:08.268
and therefore they must be true
eyther to other."

00:42:08.268 --> 00:42:13.054
That's just one statement of an
ideal of mutuality within

00:42:13.054 --> 00:42:15.851
marriage,
within the management of the

00:42:15.851 --> 00:42:18.501
household,
which of course found its

00:42:18.501 --> 00:42:23.119
immediate expression every day
in the day-to-day activities of

00:42:23.119 --> 00:42:24.179
households.
 

00:42:24.179 --> 00:42:30.217
That certainly didn't transform
them into spheres of equality of

00:42:30.217 --> 00:42:31.079
course.
 

00:42:31.079 --> 00:42:36.175
But it could and did involve
the development of working

00:42:36.175 --> 00:42:41.460
relationships of mutual support
and mutual respect in the

00:42:41.460 --> 00:42:46.650
pursuit of priorities that were
essentially shared.

00:42:46.650 --> 00:42:49.072
So, in short,
the household was certainly a

00:42:49.072 --> 00:42:52.074
sphere of power,
it was certainly a sphere of

00:42:52.074 --> 00:42:55.373
authority,
but it was one in which their

00:42:55.373 --> 00:43:00.257
exercise was also constantly
influenced by the play of the

00:43:00.257 --> 00:43:04.199
individual personalities of
those involved.

00:43:04.199 --> 00:43:10.342
And I think if one wants to
work on this kind of problem one

00:43:10.342 --> 00:43:16.275
needs to be sensitive to the
balance between these various

00:43:16.275 --> 00:43:17.630
elements.
 

00:43:17.630 --> 00:43:21.126
So, to conclude,
society and economy in the

00:43:21.126 --> 00:43:26.039
early modern period has been
described by one historian,

00:43:26.039 --> 00:43:29.717
David Rollison,
as a "culture of

00:43:29.717 --> 00:43:33.190
households in a landscape."
 

00:43:33.190 --> 00:43:37.827
The household was certainly
fundamental and it was

00:43:37.827 --> 00:43:43.695
fundamental to both continuity
and change in the social history

00:43:43.695 --> 00:43:45.400
of the period.
 

00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:49.117
A lot of the characteristics
that I've been describing

00:43:49.117 --> 00:43:53.327
endured throughout the whole of
the sixteenth and seventeenth

00:43:53.327 --> 00:43:56.315
centuries,
but some aspects of household

00:43:56.315 --> 00:43:57.449
life did change.
 

00:43:57.449 --> 00:44:01.539
They changed with changing
circumstances.

00:44:01.539 --> 00:44:04.989
Some of the changes which took
place in this period in a

00:44:04.989 --> 00:44:09.452
variety of spheres--
in economy, in population,

00:44:09.452 --> 00:44:14.407
in social structure,
in culture--had their influence

00:44:14.407 --> 00:44:16.679
upon household relationships.
 

00:44:16.679 --> 00:44:19.590
Some of them threatened the
viability of household

00:44:19.590 --> 00:44:22.918
economies, some aspects of
economic and population change

00:44:22.918 --> 00:44:23.869
for example.
 

00:44:23.869 --> 00:44:28.079
Some changes provided new
opportunities,

00:44:28.079 --> 00:44:31.199
new opportunities for the
consumption of household goods,

00:44:31.199 --> 00:44:35.878
new opportunities for the
education of children and other

00:44:35.878 --> 00:44:40.639
things which we'll see in due
course in later lectures.

00:44:40.639 --> 00:44:45.601
In general, one could also say
that the course of change in

00:44:45.601 --> 00:44:50.733
this period and the outcomes of
change crucially involved the

00:44:50.733 --> 00:44:55.010
responses to changing
circumstances of thousands of

00:44:55.010 --> 00:44:59.697
households,
and all of their members had a

00:44:59.697 --> 00:45:02.320
hand in those responses.
 

00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:08.472
It was never just a matter of
impersonal social forces acting

00:45:08.472 --> 00:45:10.320
upon households.
 

00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:13.739
Individuals and families made
their decisions,

00:45:13.739 --> 00:45:17.039
adapted their strategies in
accordance with their values,

00:45:17.039 --> 00:45:21.036
in accordance with their
priorities in meeting the

00:45:21.036 --> 00:45:25.425
various changes of the period,
and thinking about it that way

00:45:25.425 --> 00:45:28.137
is helpful,
I think, because when we think

00:45:28.137 --> 00:45:31.893
about it that way we can give
some of the abstractions and

00:45:31.893 --> 00:45:36.045
generalizations about the great
processes that took place in the

00:45:36.045 --> 00:45:40.262
early modern period something of
a human face at the level of the

00:45:40.262 --> 00:45:43.954
household,
and in many ways it's the

00:45:43.954 --> 00:45:48.664
capacity of historians to
recapture the shifting

00:45:48.664 --> 00:45:54.277
expressions on those faces which
makes these things worth

00:45:54.277 --> 00:45:55.679
studying.
 

00:45:55.679 --> 00:45:55.998
Okay.
 

00:45:55.998 --> 00:45:59.389
Well, next time I'll go on to
look at various kinds of

00:45:59.389 --> 00:46:02.523
communities and their
institutions and patterns of

00:46:02.523 --> 00:46:03.739
relationships.
 

00:46:03.739 --> 00:46:09.000

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:10.223
- Okay, good morning, everybody.

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:16.420
Today, we are going to talk
about the housing crisis

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:20.280
and its aftermath, which
could've been subtitled

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:21.863
the tragedy of errors.

00:00:22.793 --> 00:00:26.450
And we're gonna work our way
through the various errors

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:30.910
and the tragedy of it
over the next hour or so.

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.200
I want to start with President Clinton

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.250
speaking in the East
Room of the White House

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.010
at a session with his then Secretary

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:45.010
of Housing and Urban Development,
Henry Cisneros in 1995.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.180
- One of the great successes
of the United States

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.090
in this century has been
the partnership forged

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.820
by the national government
and the private sector

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.310
to steadily expand the dream

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:01.880
of home ownership to all Americans.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.020
In 1934, President Roosevelt created

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:06.120
the Federal Housing Administration

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.620
and made home ownership available

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.220
to millions of Americans who
couldn't afford it before that.

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.290
51 years ago, just this month,

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:16.480
Harry Truman rewarded servicemen and women

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.890
with the G.I. Bill of
Rights, which created

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.310
the VA home loan guarantee program.

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.280
That extended the dream of home ownership

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.023
to a whole new generation of Americans.

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.030
For four decades after
that, in the greatest period

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.030
of expansion of middle class dreams

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.423
any country has ever seen
anywhere in human history,

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.790
home ownership expanded as incomes rose,

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.240
jobs increased, the educational level

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.920
of the American people improved.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.310
But in the 1980s, as
the vice president said,

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.163
that dream began to slip away.

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.550
I ran for president in large measure

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:57.430
because I wanted to restore that dream

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.760
to grow the middle class,
shrink the underclass,

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.920
promote the mainstream values
of work and responsibility,

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.060
family and community,
and reform government

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.070
in a way that would enhance opportunity

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:11.233
and shrink bureaucracy.

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.020
We made good progress, but
we have to do a lot more.

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.460
I ask all of you just one more time

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.553
to look at that chart,

00:02:21.553 --> 00:02:24.040
and I wish I had a lot of other chart

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.053
to show you that would reinforce that.

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.013
Home ownership declines then
stabilizes at a lower level.

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:34.260
At the same time, more
and more American families

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.700
working harder for the same
or lower wages every year

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.470
under new and difficult stresses.

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.030
It seems to me that we have a serious,

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.943
serious unmet obligation to
try to reverse these trend.

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.400
- So there you have
President Clinton in 1995

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.900
bemoaning the decline in home ownership

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.320
that has set in over the
previous several decades

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:07.320
and pledging his
administration to increase it.

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:11.691
And we will see that Clinton was not alone

00:03:11.691 --> 00:03:15.110
that the desire to expand home ownership,

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.770
which is closely
associated, as you can tell,

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:21.780
from his comments there,
with mainstream accounts

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.140
of the American dream has been bipartisan

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:31.140
and pursued by administrations
over a number of decades.

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.900
Our agenda today is to
think about what produced

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.910
the subprime mortgage
crisis that played out

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:44.530
in the financial crisis that
we talked about on Tuesday.

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.880
Think about the results of
the subprime mortgage crisis.

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.880
And what are the lessons
that we should draw,

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:56.880
given the larger narrative
and concerns in our course.

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:00.720
And you really, in order
to get an understanding

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.270
of the housing crisis and how it played,

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:07.470
has played itself out,
we really have to go back

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.650
and understand the place of housing

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:15.070
in fights about justice and particularly

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:18.953
racial justice in America
back to the 1930s.

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:22.470
And what I'm calling here the transition

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.120
from hard to soft
apartheid, or if you like,

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.770
from legalistic to market-based
apartheid in America,

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.950
is something that really
occurred over the course

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:38.950
of a number of decades after the 1930s.

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:44.010
If you go back to the 1930s,
it would not have been unusual

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:47.965
to see signs like this in neighborhoods,

00:04:47.965 --> 00:04:51.360
particularly, but not
exclusively in the south.

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:56.360
And this is what I, this
is the height of Jim Crow

00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:00.410
and the era in which
explicit racial segregation

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:02.890
was the order of the day.

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:05.430
When people bought and sold houses,

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:09.960
they would often contain
so-called restrictive covenants.

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:14.960
Here's a passage from a
deed transferring some land.

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:21.368
It says: None of the said
lands, interests therein

00:05:21.368 --> 00:05:23.340
or improvements thereon shall be sold,

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:25.620
resold, conveyed, leased, rented,

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:28.720
or in any way used, occupied, or acquired

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:32.020
by any person of Negro
blood or to any person

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:35.370
of the Semitic race, blood, or origin,

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:37.330
which racial description shall be deemed

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:42.330
to include Armenians, Jews,
Hebrews, Persians, or Syrians.

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:48.820
So this is a notion of
restrictive covenants

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:53.820
and they were, by the way,
perfectly legal until 1948,

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:59.410
famous Supreme Court decision
Shelley versus Kraemer,

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:03.900
a five to zero decision with
three justices abstaining

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:08.340
because they all own houses
that had restrictive covenants,

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:11.260
and what the court said in that opinion

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:15.050
was that while it was a violation

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:18.180
of the Equal Protection
Clause of the 14th Amendment

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:22.243
for states to enforce these
restrictive covenants,

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:27.770
it was no violation of the Constitution

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:30.780
for people to put them
in the deeds of houses

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:32.710
and voluntary abide by them.

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:37.020
So if you were, wanted to signal to buyers

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:41.620
that this is a Whites only neighborhood

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:46.620
and we shouldn't allow
non-White to come in,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.720
that was not illegal.

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:51.650
And so, and that of course goes back

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:55.290
to something I mentioned to
you in an earlier lecture,

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:57.750
namely after Reconstruction,

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:00.490
we had very restrictive readings

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:02.960
of the civil right, Civil War Amendments

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:04.210
by the Supreme Court

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:07.520
and in particular they
said of the 14th Amendment

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:10.150
that it didn't apply to private action

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:11.440
but only state action.

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:14.180
So Shelley versus Kraemer in 1948

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:16.020
said these restrictive covenants

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:17.970
could no longer be enforced,

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:20.980
but that didn't mean that they went away

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:24.503
and they didn't for some time thereafter.

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:30.430
This is something called
the 8 Mile Wall in Detroit.

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:31.933
Anyone here from Detroit?

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:37.883
Anyone know what the 8 Mile Wall was?

00:07:40.766 --> 00:07:41.660
It was actually half a mile long,

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:44.010
it's not eight miles long,
it's half a mile long,

00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:46.980
but it's on something called 8 Mile Road,

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:49.650
and 8 Mile Road was a physical barrier

00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:54.590
between White and non-White neighborhoods.

00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:57.180
So the idea was to keep African American,

00:07:57.180 --> 00:08:00.590
presumably principally
African American children

00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:03.140
from going into White neighborhoods

00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:06.920
and it since, you can see, has
had been covered in graffiti,

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:10.880
but it's still there as a kind of monument

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:13.350
to the physical segregation,

00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:18.350
what I'm calling hard
apartheid of the Jim Crow era.

00:08:18.570 --> 00:08:22.273
That was actually, the 8
Mile Wall was built in 1941.

00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:29.053
Anyone know what this is?

00:08:33.090 --> 00:08:37.278
It's a map, yeah,
(students mumbling)

00:08:37.278 --> 00:08:38.713
what's all the scribbling on it?

00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:43.910
- Redlining.
- This is so-called redlining,

00:08:43.910 --> 00:08:46.870
and you can see this saying,

00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:50.210
this is an OK place to write mortgages,

00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:54.393
this is OK, this is
super, this is the hood,

00:08:54.393 --> 00:08:55.710
and this is don't even think

00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:59.453
about writing mortgages
in this neighborhood.

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:03.560
And so actually the history of redlining

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:06.540
goes all the way back to the 1930s

00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:10.000
and initially the government
was in fact behind it.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.820
In 1934, we got the National Housing Act

00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:17.750
which created the Federal
Housing Administration,

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:20.450
and the following year, they commissioned

00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:25.450
the Federal Loan Bank Board
to run studies in 239 cities

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:29.290
in the service of underwriting.

00:09:29.290 --> 00:09:31.360
They wanted to help underwriters know

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:35.900
where these risky loans actually were.

00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:40.515
And so the idea was that
mortgage underwriters would know

00:09:40.515 --> 00:09:45.050
what to charge and whether,
and what circumstances

00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:49.640
underwriting would be warranted.

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:52.880
But of course, it soon became a proxy

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:56.950
for denying loans, mortgages in minority

00:09:56.950 --> 00:10:01.603
neighborhoods and to minority lenders.

00:10:03.774 --> 00:10:08.500
So redlining became used for that purpose.

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:12.190
And as you can see, just if you Google up

00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:15.260
redlining on Google Images,

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:18.560
you can find maps of
virtually any American,

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:22.650
and by the way, also Canadian
cities from this period.

00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:25.640
This is one from Seattle,
and you can see there

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:28.480
from the color code, the green is best,

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:30.680
the blue is still desirable,

00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:33.637
the yellow is the declining neighborhoods,

00:10:33.637 --> 00:10:37.810
and the red, hence
redlining, was hazardous.

00:10:37.810 --> 00:10:40.020
And so that's one from Seattle,

00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:41.790
I've just put a few up here,

00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:46.790
one from San Francisco, Buffalo, New York,

00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:51.560
Austin, Texas, and I could've put many,

00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:54.670
many more, many more of these.

00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:59.670
And so this practice of
redlining reinforced, of course,

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:07.080
racial and class-based
segregation of neighborhoods,

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:11.020
because banks would only
want to lend in the areas

00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:15.560
that were least risky and most desirable.

00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:20.560
In 1968, the Fair Housing
Act prohibited discrimination

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:25.980
in lending based on race
and also by neighborhood.

00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:28.740
This was reinforced by even more

00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:32.710
stringent legislation a decade later,

00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:37.710
the 1977 Community Re-investment
Act, reiterated these bans,

00:11:38.110 --> 00:11:43.110
but they're extremely
difficult to actually enforce.

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:46.200
This is what I'm calling
the era of soft apartheid,

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:49.320
you don't necessarily
need restrictive covenants

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:54.320
and we'll see this play
out in four-part harmony

00:11:55.130 --> 00:11:57.890
and in the rest of today's lecture.

00:11:57.890 --> 00:12:02.890
But even though redlining and
loans based on discrimination

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:08.830
either against particular
neighborhoods or by race

00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:11.563
has been illegal since the 1960s,

00:12:12.890 --> 00:12:17.890
as recently as 2015, there were
huge settlements with banks

00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:20.890
who had been caught in this practice.

00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:24.840
For instance, Hudson City Savings Bank,

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:28.360
which services New York,
New Jersey, and Pennsylvania

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:31.303
reached the largest settlement ever

00:12:31.303 --> 00:12:35.310
with the Department of
Justice, $33 million settlement

00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:40.310
for denying loans to African
American and Latino borrowers

00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:47.000
and were required as
part of that settlement

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.800
to open branches in
minority neighborhoods.

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:54.510
And in that same year, there
was actually a $200 million

00:12:54.510 --> 00:12:57.110
settlement with HUD, the
Department of Housing

00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:59.360
and Urban Development, between,

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:02.670
for a bank called Associated Bank

00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:07.140
for doing the same thing
in Chicago and Milwaukee.

00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:10.380
And again, they were
required to open branches.

00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:14.620
So even though redlining
is no longer legal,

00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:18.100
that doesn't mean it doesn't occur.

00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:21.240
And so this is one of the ways in which

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:26.010
it's become possible for markets

00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:27.960
and market practices essentially

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:32.640
to underwrite the
segregation of neighborhoods.

00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:37.030
So I asked you to spend
a little bit of time

00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:42.030
with the Parable of the
Polygons, the Schelling,

00:13:42.071 --> 00:13:43.930
which is a user-friendly version

00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:47.225
of Schelling neighborhood tipping game.

00:13:47.225 --> 00:13:49.040
Who did, did you spend some time with it?

00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:50.693
What did you take away from it?

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:54.880
- [Student] I found it a little depressing

00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:56.770
when I got toward the end.
- What's depressing about it?

00:13:56.770 --> 00:13:59.060
- [Student] Well, that
in most of the scenarios,

00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:02.190
you end up with very
segregated neighborhoods

00:14:02.190 --> 00:14:04.640
and you have--
- But how do we get

00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:06.070
to segregated neighborhood?

00:14:06.070 --> 00:14:08.090
- [Student] Well, there was,
a lot of the rules were about,

00:14:08.090 --> 00:14:12.780
you're only happy if, they
came down with the 1/3 rule,

00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:15.400
so if it went down--
- Just back up a little bit

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:17.567
and explain how it works
for anybody who didn't--

00:14:17.567 --> 00:14:20.190
- [Student] All right, so
there's two types of polygons.

00:14:20.190 --> 00:14:22.210
There's the triangles and the squares.

00:14:22.210 --> 00:14:25.290
And basically the point of
the game was to show you

00:14:25.290 --> 00:14:27.600
at what point, by looking at the map,

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:30.880
when all the triangles and
all the polygons were happy

00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:33.050
based on who their neighbors were.

00:14:33.050 --> 00:14:35.400
And what you discovered was that

00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:37.150
the more you played around with it,

00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:39.830
you needed to have
segregated neighborhoods

00:14:39.830 --> 00:14:42.060
for people to be happy

00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:44.700
or generally happy with their environment.

00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:48.360
- Okay, anyone want to add a point

00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:51.623
that was taken away to what he said?

00:14:55.050 --> 00:14:55.883
Yeah?

00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:02.440
- [Student] Yeah, I was
just really surprised

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:05.110
by how little personal bias it takes

00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:06.300
in order to get--
- Okay, sorry,

00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:08.140
elaborate on that.
- Collective bias.

00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:11.580
Because even though one square or triangle

00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:14.780
might only need to be
surrounded by like 1/3 of people

00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:16.680
who are like them to be happy,

00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:18.600
the way that that ends up playing out

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:20.550
is that in order for everyone to be happy

00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:23.210
it reconfigures so that you're
actually really surrounded

00:15:23.210 --> 00:15:26.210
by people who are mostly like you.

00:15:26.210 --> 00:15:29.880
It doesn't actually factor out to that 1/3

00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:31.860
in like a collective way.

00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:36.860
- Exactly, so he's, just to
summarize what you're saying,

00:15:37.170 --> 00:15:40.360
very mild levels of prejudice,

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:42.700
where mild is understood to mean,

00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:46.883
I just want some of my
neighbors to be like me,

00:15:48.855 --> 00:15:52.650
20% to 1/3 is enough to, of course,

00:15:52.650 --> 00:15:56.580
entire neighborhoods to
segregate completely.

00:15:56.580 --> 00:16:01.580
So very low levels of prejudice
will segregate neighborhoods

00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:04.630
simply by the voluntary
choices that people make.

00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:06.460
You don't need restrictive covenants,

00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:09.400
you don't need all this
other stuff to get it,

00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:11.703
that's what I'm calling soft apartheid.

00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:17.790
And not only that, it's
very difficult to undo,

00:16:17.826 --> 00:16:20.200
it's very difficult to reverse,

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:24.360
and less people have an
active desire to integrate.

00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:27.140
That we have to change their preferences,

00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:32.140
otherwise, with very
low levels of discomfort

00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:37.470
at having large numbers of
your neighbors be unlike you

00:16:37.470 --> 00:16:41.870
is gonna be enough to
segregate neighborhoods.

00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:44.133
And so this is a very famous,

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:48.630
Schelling was a brilliant economist,

00:16:48.630 --> 00:16:50.820
most of his works is on arms races,

00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:53.290
but this neighborhood tipping game

00:16:53.290 --> 00:16:55.170
tells you that if you start off

00:16:55.170 --> 00:16:57.480
with a neighborhood that looks like that

00:16:59.070 --> 00:17:03.600
and people have these
very low levels of desire

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:06.920
to be surrounded by some
people like themselves,

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:11.403
it's gonna wind up in pretty
short order like that.

00:17:12.313 --> 00:17:14.570
And of course, we don't start off

00:17:14.570 --> 00:17:17.040
with something like that
in most American cities,

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:18.410
so it's even tougher.

00:17:18.410 --> 00:17:19.950
What we really start off

00:17:19.950 --> 00:17:21.890
is something much more like this,

00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:25.270
this is a map of Chicago
with neighborhoods

00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:27.670
are already heavily segregated.

00:17:27.670 --> 00:17:32.670
And what would be required
would be to desegregate them

00:17:34.670 --> 00:17:38.100
and that's taking Schelling to heart

00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:41.640
is not going to happen unless you have

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:45.810
pretty radical changes in the population.

00:17:45.810 --> 00:17:49.810
And so in some ways, it
might be said that actually

00:17:49.810 --> 00:17:53.350
soft apartheid is harder to combat

00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:56.173
than hard apartheid or Jim Crow.

00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:00.030
I've given you one reason already,

00:18:00.030 --> 00:18:01.530
first of all, you would really have

00:18:01.530 --> 00:18:05.370
to have active changes
in people's preferences,

00:18:05.370 --> 00:18:08.930
positive desires to
desegregate the neighborhoods,

00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:13.930
not just absence of resistance
to the desires of others.

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:22.680
Any other reasons why soft apartheid

00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:25.100
might actually be harder to fight

00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:27.173
against than hard apartheid?

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:32.770
By hard apartheid, I'm
talking about de jure,

00:18:32.770 --> 00:18:36.560
restrictive covenants,
laws outlawing people

00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:39.600
living in certain neighborhoods and so on.

00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:40.433
Yeah?

00:18:47.130 --> 00:18:50.680
- [Student] Is it more
unconscious, like unconscious bias?

00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:53.830
- It could be, there could be
issues of unconscious bias,

00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:56.420
that might be part of it.

00:18:56.420 --> 00:18:59.533
Anything else, what were you gonna, yeah?

00:19:05.035 --> 00:19:06.340
- [Student] There's an
economic factor now,

00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:09.490
housing prices have gone
so much that it's difficult

00:19:09.490 --> 00:19:12.370
to actually, even though you enforce it,

00:19:12.370 --> 00:19:15.583
to have people move in if
they have lower incomes.

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:18.972
- So people are gonna self-segregate

00:19:18.972 --> 00:19:23.523
by socioeconomic status, yep, okay.

00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:26.203
Anything else?

00:19:28.730 --> 00:19:31.010
- It's much harder to prove.
- Pardon?

00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:33.680
- It's much harder to prove.
- It's harder to prove,

00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:35.833
and it's harder to identify.

00:19:41.746 --> 00:19:45.549
If you think about hard
apartheid, it provides targets.

00:19:45.549 --> 00:19:48.710
If you wanna get rid of
restrictive covenants,

00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:50.500
let's say, we can have a campaign

00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:52.110
to get rid of restrictive covenants,

00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:55.450
gives you a kind of a proximate
goal to organize around

00:19:55.450 --> 00:19:58.400
and to get rid of and
I'm gonna come back more

00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:02.000
and talk about the importance
of proximate goals.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.520
There's also a literature in psychology

00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:07.303
about so-called boundary permeability.

00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:11.040
Academics never say in
words of one syllable

00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:13.970
what can be said in
words of five syllables.

00:20:13.970 --> 00:20:16.513
But here, this is the basic idea.

00:20:18.130 --> 00:20:22.800
If there's a law which
says no Blacks and Jews

00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:25.540
can join a New Haven Lawn Club,

00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:29.890
there will be a campaign
to get rid of that rule.

00:20:29.890 --> 00:20:32.210
There will be a campaign
to have Blacks and Jews

00:20:32.210 --> 00:20:34.863
allowed to join the New Haven Lawn Club.

00:20:35.710 --> 00:20:38.580
If there's no rule, but one Black family

00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:42.340
and one Jewish family is
allowed to join every 15 years,

00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:43.923
there won't be a campaign.

00:20:47.410 --> 00:20:52.270
Similarly, if you have a rule which says

00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:54.703
no junior faculty will get tenure.

00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:58.083
Then you'll get a junior faculty union.

00:20:59.130 --> 00:21:01.790
If you don't have a rule, but in fact,

00:21:01.790 --> 00:21:04.730
only one in eight of the
junior faculty gets tenure,

00:21:04.730 --> 00:21:09.330
which has been a Yale
equilibrium for many decades,

00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:12.986
then you don't get a
junior faculty union, why?

00:21:12.986 --> 00:21:16.530
It's not entirely clear,
but it may well be,

00:21:16.530 --> 00:21:19.590
and this is claim in the
boundary permeability literature,

00:21:19.590 --> 00:21:22.520
everybody thinks I'm gonna be the one,

00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:27.520
I'm gonna be the one, so if you have norms

00:21:27.610 --> 00:21:32.610
or practices that function
so as to produce exclusion

00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:38.100
without actually having formal exclusion,

00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:40.390
it becomes much more difficult

00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:45.540
to get people to organize, to change them.

00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:49.120
And so this is, if you look at something

00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:50.833
like the Civil Rights Act,

00:21:52.107 --> 00:21:57.107
and you say this is 1964 and
the Voting Rights Act of 1965,

00:21:58.096 --> 00:22:01.280
what has been, what's been achieved?

00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:06.280
It's mostly that the de jure,
rather that the de facto

00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:09.570
forms of racial discrimination
that have been stamped out.

00:22:09.570 --> 00:22:14.070
It's much harder to
stamped out the de facto.

00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:19.070
So we have inherited a world
in which the hard apartheid

00:22:19.170 --> 00:22:21.950
of the Jim Crow era has been replaced

00:22:21.950 --> 00:22:25.800
by the much more nebulous,
but in some ways,

00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:28.820
more difficult to deal
with, soft apartheid,

00:22:28.820 --> 00:22:31.330
that gets generated as a byproduct

00:22:31.330 --> 00:22:33.410
of the lack of proximate goals,

00:22:33.410 --> 00:22:38.280
the tipping phenomenon
that Schelling describes,

00:22:39.570 --> 00:22:44.530
and the very big obstacles to
organizing collective action

00:22:44.530 --> 00:22:47.300
in circumstances where you have

00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:50.333
high levels of boundary permeability.

00:22:51.210 --> 00:22:53.650
So that's something to bear in mind

00:22:53.650 --> 00:22:56.560
and we'll come back as we
see how this played out.

00:22:56.560 --> 00:23:01.010
People attempting to combat
the effects of soft apartheid

00:23:01.010 --> 00:23:04.300
played out in the housing crisis.

00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:09.300
Now, if you said, what was the
cause of the housing crisis,

00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:13.340
there's no single answer, it
was really a perfect storm.

00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:18.340
A number of factors came
together to produce this result.

00:23:19.090 --> 00:23:22.083
And I wanna mention four.

00:23:23.390 --> 00:23:25.230
The first one we've already heard

00:23:25.230 --> 00:23:27.090
from President Clinton's mouth,

00:23:27.090 --> 00:23:31.810
and here I, this he wrote
the year before that speech,

00:23:31.810 --> 00:23:34.047
but here you can see, "More Americans

00:23:34.047 --> 00:23:35.627
"should own their own homes,

00:23:35.627 --> 00:23:38.267
"for reasons that are
economic and tangible,

00:23:38.267 --> 00:23:41.097
"and reasons that are
emotional and intangible,

00:23:41.097 --> 00:23:43.697
"but go to the heart of
what it means to harbor,

00:23:43.697 --> 00:23:47.760
"to nourish, and to expand
the American dream."

00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:50.980
Home ownership is part of what people

00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:55.253
who want to realize the
American dream aspire to,

00:23:56.300 --> 00:24:01.300
and a big part of the housing crisis

00:24:03.910 --> 00:24:08.520
grew out of the agenda of extending

00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:11.680
home ownership to previously excluded

00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:14.000
racial and ethnic minorities,

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.620
exactly the people who are
being discriminated against

00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:20.213
as a result of soft apartheid.

00:24:22.729 --> 00:24:26.450
And this graph sort of
reflects the numbers

00:24:26.450 --> 00:24:27.980
that Clinton was talking about,

00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:30.300
you can see that in March of the,

00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:34.780
starting actually at the
beginning of the post-war period,

00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:37.370
you see big increases in home ownership,

00:24:37.370 --> 00:24:42.370
and then it levels off and
successive administrations

00:24:42.770 --> 00:24:46.192
do take actions to increase it.

00:24:46.192 --> 00:24:47.220
Now we're gonna talk about

00:24:48.276 --> 00:24:51.163
till it finally reaches a peak in 2008.

00:24:53.530 --> 00:24:58.530
Second is securitization of
the subprime mortgage market.

00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:05.013
So just to be clear, a
subprime mortgage is,

00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:09.010
we're talking about the
subprime mortgage crisis,

00:25:09.010 --> 00:25:10.393
what is a subprime mortgage?

00:25:10.393 --> 00:25:15.393
A subprime mortgage is a
mortgage that is risky to hold.

00:25:15.510 --> 00:25:18.980
It is risky because it is
being given to somebody

00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:23.310
who either has not a
very good credit history

00:25:23.310 --> 00:25:26.720
or it's being given with
a very low down payment

00:25:27.803 --> 00:25:31.050
so that the home owner doesn't
have a lot of incentive

00:25:31.050 --> 00:25:33.443
to keep paying the mortgage,

00:25:33.443 --> 00:25:35.560
we're looking at more about that later.

00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:39.509
It's a mortgage that it's
risky for a lender to hold.

00:25:39.509 --> 00:25:42.010
It's subprime and so
normally, in a market system,

00:25:42.010 --> 00:25:44.310
subprime mortgages charge higher

00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:46.340
interest rates than regular mortgages

00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:51.340
precisely because they have
to bear the cost of that risk.

00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:54.230
So that's what a subprime mortgage is.

00:25:54.230 --> 00:25:59.230
Now, securitization of subprime mortgages,

00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:03.360
what securitization of
subprime mortgages refers to

00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:06.093
is the following, (coughs)

00:26:07.330 --> 00:26:12.330
if I had wanted to buy a
house, say, in the 1970s,

00:26:12.710 --> 00:26:16.303
I would have gone down to the local bank,

00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:19.997
they would've said, "You want a mortgage?

00:26:19.997 --> 00:26:22.180
"Well, give us your credit history,"

00:26:22.180 --> 00:26:25.130
I would've had an interview
with the bank manager

00:26:25.130 --> 00:26:27.150
and I would have had to put

00:26:27.150 --> 00:26:32.150
20% down on the house,
the bank would have,

00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:34.510
probably the bank manager
would have known me,

00:26:34.510 --> 00:26:36.220
it would have been, I lived in Guilford,

00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:38.110
that would be in the Guilford Savings Bank

00:26:38.110 --> 00:26:41.760
as it in fact was, but they
would run their credit history,

00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:45.890
they would become comfortable
with lending me the money,

00:26:45.890 --> 00:26:48.800
I would take out a 30-year mortgage

00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:52.920
and they would then hold that mortgage

00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:55.480
and service that mortgage
and I would spend

00:26:56.342 --> 00:27:00.320
the next several decades
paying off that mortgage

00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:02.260
back to the Guilford Savings Bank,

00:27:02.260 --> 00:27:06.263
that is basically how
mortgages used to work.

00:27:07.970 --> 00:27:12.610
Securitization is the
process whereby banks

00:27:13.470 --> 00:27:17.010
not only sell, once
they give the mortgage,

00:27:17.010 --> 00:27:22.010
they sell it to another bank
or another financial entity

00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:25.630
and those mortgages then become chopped up

00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:28.760
and sold off in pieces and traded.

00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:32.160
So they start, they become securities.

00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:34.830
And it's important to understand

00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:39.830
that the securitization of mortgages

00:27:39.940 --> 00:27:43.673
actually begins with
the federal government.

00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:49.080
Fannie Mae, Fannie Mae is so-called

00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:51.553
government sponsored entity.

00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:58.410
It was established in basically the 1938

00:27:58.410 --> 00:28:00.810
as part of the second new deal

00:28:00.810 --> 00:28:02.570
in the wake of the depression,

00:28:02.570 --> 00:28:05.720
more than 25% of America's home owners

00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:10.720
had their homes foreclosed
on in the depression,

00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:14.820
and it was extremely difficult for people

00:28:15.666 --> 00:28:18.343
to get mortgages, to buy homes.

00:28:19.254 --> 00:28:20.580
And so the Roosevelt administration

00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:22.490
wanted to make it easier.

00:28:22.490 --> 00:28:26.823
And so what the Freddie,

00:28:28.170 --> 00:28:33.110
Fannie Mae quickly got involved in doing

00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:35.600
was essentially two things.

00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:39.260
One was buying up mortgages from banks,

00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:42.160
and secondly, creating liquidity,

00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:47.160
because if you think about,
if Guilford Savings Bank

00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:52.380
is holding that mortgage for 30 years,

00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:54.630
they can't use that, they can't give

00:28:54.630 --> 00:28:56.660
another mortgage with that same money,

00:28:56.660 --> 00:29:01.660
but if they sell that
mortgage to Fannie Mae,

00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:05.994
they can then use the money
to give out more mortgages.

00:29:05.994 --> 00:29:09.960
So Fannie, starting way back in the 30s,

00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:12.050
but much more in recent decades

00:29:12.050 --> 00:29:14.590
began buying up mortgages

00:29:16.370 --> 00:29:19.230
to create liquidity in
the mortgage market.

00:29:19.230 --> 00:29:23.270
And then they also wanted more money

00:29:23.270 --> 00:29:25.210
with which to do this.

00:29:25.210 --> 00:29:28.450
So they began the process
of securitization.

00:29:28.450 --> 00:29:33.450
Fannie Mae actually started chopping

00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:37.130
these mortgages up and selling them

00:29:37.130 --> 00:29:41.790
and then they would become
traded as securities.

00:29:41.790 --> 00:29:46.250
And it's, it was a government entity,

00:29:46.250 --> 00:29:51.250
but eventually it became
partially privatized.

00:29:51.892 --> 00:29:56.520
So you can trade Fannie Mae stocks

00:29:56.520 --> 00:29:58.455
on the stock exchange now,

00:29:58.455 --> 00:30:03.455
it's a public-private
partnership, if you like,

00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:10.130
and that is part of the
source of its problems.

00:30:10.130 --> 00:30:13.100
But the securitization of mortgages

00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:17.120
essentially got going
because Fannie started

00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:19.770
selling them off and
then they would be resold

00:30:19.770 --> 00:30:22.330
and repackaged and resold and repackaged,

00:30:22.330 --> 00:30:25.010
and more and more finely sliced.

00:30:25.010 --> 00:30:30.010
And they got the great book about this

00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:34.540
is "The Big Short" which
some of you might have read,

00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:37.900
but people had very little understanding

00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:42.097
about internal composition
of these buckets

00:30:43.771 --> 00:30:47.340
of mortgages that were being traded.

00:30:47.340 --> 00:30:50.260
Another thing that nobody
was aware of at the time

00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:52.700
but became obvious in hindsight

00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:55.650
was people had generally
thought of real estate

00:30:55.650 --> 00:30:58.500
as a hedge against the stock market,

00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:03.500
because you don't wanna have
all your eggs in one basket.

00:31:03.550 --> 00:31:06.960
But the more you had the
securitization and trading

00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:09.340
of these mortgages on Wall Street,

00:31:09.340 --> 00:31:12.477
the more actually they
were operating in tandem,

00:31:12.477 --> 00:31:15.630
and so when the real
estate markets crashed,

00:31:15.630 --> 00:31:17.593
so did the stock market.

00:31:21.420 --> 00:31:23.200
The government started to do this,

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:27.360
but then private banks
also started to do this,

00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:30.380
and the big investment
banks got into their own

00:31:30.380 --> 00:31:34.400
securitization and indeed
after 2002, 2003, 2004,

00:31:36.510 --> 00:31:39.010
when regulators were
finally getting nervous

00:31:39.010 --> 00:31:41.430
and started pulling back the government's

00:31:41.430 --> 00:31:43.570
activity in securitization,

00:31:43.570 --> 00:31:48.050
that's when the private sector
securitization ramped up.

00:31:48.050 --> 00:31:50.890
And so the good news was that

00:31:50.890 --> 00:31:53.320
more and more liquidity was being created,

00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:57.723
it was getting easier and
easier to write these mortgages,

00:31:58.620 --> 00:32:03.620
the bad news was that there
was more and more vulnerability

00:32:04.580 --> 00:32:09.580
in the system and people
started to lose the incentive

00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:12.600
to conduct the sort of due diligence

00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:15.780
that you would otherwise
conduct in giving out a loan.

00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:20.210
If the Guilford Savings Bank
is gonna give me a loan,

00:32:20.210 --> 00:32:22.260
they need to be confident

00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:24.680
that I'm gonna be able
to pay that loan back.

00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:27.760
If the Guilford Savings
Bank is gonna sell the loan

00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:30.550
they give me to somebody
else the next day,

00:32:30.550 --> 00:32:32.680
then it doesn't matter to them

00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:35.510
whether two years from now

00:32:35.510 --> 00:32:38.310
I'm not gonna be able to pay my mortgage.

00:32:38.310 --> 00:32:40.320
So they don't have the same incentive

00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:43.520
to do the due diligence
in giving out the loans.

00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:45.770
And it's not just in giving out the loans.

00:32:45.770 --> 00:32:50.770
If you think about appraisals,

00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:54.210
if the Guilford Savings
Bank is giving me a loan,

00:32:54.210 --> 00:32:56.970
they wanna be sure that when they're told

00:32:56.970 --> 00:33:01.970
the house is worth $150,000,
it is worth $150,000.

00:33:03.390 --> 00:33:06.730
If they're gonna sell that
loan, it doesn't really matter,

00:33:06.730 --> 00:33:09.960
and so you started to get
not only the phenomenon

00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:14.600
of drive-by appraisals, but
what the appraisal company

00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:18.520
soon discovered was that if
they didn't give the appraisal,

00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:20.600
that the borrower and lender wanted

00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:23.050
in order to facilitate the transaction,

00:33:23.050 --> 00:33:25.450
they would just go to
another appraisal company.

00:33:26.367 --> 00:33:31.130
And so the appraisal
company's also were complicit,

00:33:31.130 --> 00:33:33.250
and indeed, I can remember

00:33:33.250 --> 00:33:37.303
refinancing a mortgage
in about 2006, 2007,

00:33:40.140 --> 00:33:45.140
I wanted to borrow out the
equity to do this and that,

00:33:45.323 --> 00:33:50.323
and I needed the appraisal
to be some number,

00:33:50.590 --> 00:33:54.853
I've forgotten what it was, $850,000,

00:33:56.859 --> 00:33:57.910
and we got the drive-by appraisal,

00:33:57.910 --> 00:34:00.007
it said it was worth $900,000,

00:34:00.007 --> 00:34:05.007
and I remember sitting
there in signing the papers

00:34:05.030 --> 00:34:08.760
looking around the room,
the guy from the bank,

00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:10.710
from the attorney, and so on, I thought,

00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:15.670
nobody in this room believes
this house is worth $850,000.

00:34:15.670 --> 00:34:18.573
And indeed, it turned
out later it was not.

00:34:18.573 --> 00:34:19.890
(students laughing)

00:34:19.890 --> 00:34:23.020
But there it was, nobody had the incentive

00:34:23.020 --> 00:34:25.320
to do the kind of due diligence.

00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:30.320
So the securitization of
subprime mortgages is,

00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:32.370
and we'll see why we got more and more

00:34:32.370 --> 00:34:34.460
subprime mortgages in a minute,

00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:38.180
but there were a lot of these
very high risk mortgages

00:34:38.180 --> 00:34:41.460
that were being securitized
and being traded

00:34:41.460 --> 00:34:46.260
and there was nobody with enough
so-called skin in the game

00:34:46.260 --> 00:34:51.260
to have the incentive to
do their own due diligence.

00:34:51.378 --> 00:34:54.490
The third component of the crisis

00:34:54.490 --> 00:34:56.630
was what we talked about last time,

00:34:56.630 --> 00:34:59.570
the behavior of the banks,
the relentless drive

00:34:59.570 --> 00:35:04.130
to deregulate them and make it easier

00:35:04.130 --> 00:35:06.750
for investment banks in particular

00:35:06.750 --> 00:35:11.643
to get involved in this activity.

00:35:12.530 --> 00:35:16.150
But the fourth and most
important in many ways piece

00:35:16.150 --> 00:35:19.283
that I wanna emphasize was politics.

00:35:20.190 --> 00:35:23.070
And so the idea that the government

00:35:23.070 --> 00:35:26.320
should get involved in
addressing soft apartheid

00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:29.970
goes back at least to the 1980s.

00:35:29.970 --> 00:35:33.653
This is Jack Kemp, quarterback
for the Buffalo Bills.

00:35:35.210 --> 00:35:40.210
He was actually in 1996,
Bob Dole's running mate

00:35:41.270 --> 00:35:44.510
in his failed attempt to
unseat President Clinton,

00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:48.373
but before that, sorry, after that,

00:35:52.340 --> 00:35:55.450
before that, 1989, he was Secretary

00:35:55.450 --> 00:35:57.410
of Housing and Human Development

00:35:57.410 --> 00:36:02.110
in the George Herbert
Walker Bush administration

00:36:02.110 --> 00:36:05.560
and he called himself a
bleeding heart conservative,

00:36:05.560 --> 00:36:10.053
and he came up with this
idea of HOPE programs,

00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:15.100
Home Ownership for People
Everywhere is what HOPE stood for,

00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:17.050
Home Ownership for People Everywhere.

00:36:17.050 --> 00:36:19.150
And he had this idea that the government

00:36:19.150 --> 00:36:22.710
should sell off, this was
like Margaret Thatcher's

00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:25.540
privatization of council houses in London.

00:36:25.540 --> 00:36:27.300
The government should sell off

00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:29.720
all its public housing to the owners

00:36:31.510 --> 00:36:36.380
and he was beating the drum to do this,

00:36:36.380 --> 00:36:39.050
he actually ran into huge opposition

00:36:39.050 --> 00:36:41.820
within the Bush administration

00:36:41.820 --> 00:36:46.340
from people like Darman
who's managing the budget,

00:36:48.670 --> 00:36:52.370
and Congress was not very
excited about funding it

00:36:52.370 --> 00:36:54.460
and it turned out that just to get

00:36:54.460 --> 00:36:59.330
one of these government owned houses sold

00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:05.040
was gonna cost close to $100,000,

00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:06.750
so it kind of crashed and burn

00:37:06.750 --> 00:37:10.350
but it didn't really work as a policy.

00:37:10.350 --> 00:37:15.350
But Bush did it about
whether to get behind it,

00:37:15.370 --> 00:37:16.980
then we have already seen

00:37:16.980 --> 00:37:19.193
that in the Clinton administration,

00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:23.830
there was a lot of effort
to get behind this.

00:37:23.830 --> 00:37:25.570
And it didn't just come from Clinton,

00:37:25.570 --> 00:37:28.060
it came from the left
of the Democratic Party

00:37:28.060 --> 00:37:30.660
and from minorities in
the Democratic Party.

00:37:30.660 --> 00:37:35.660
This is Barney Frank,
as in Dodd-Frank Frank.

00:37:37.944 --> 00:37:40.860
He was considered a
very liberal congressman

00:37:40.860 --> 00:37:45.420
and he was a huge champion
for saying to Fannie Mae

00:37:45.420 --> 00:37:49.270
that you have to put
pressure on these private

00:37:49.270 --> 00:37:52.070
loan originators to give mortgages

00:37:52.070 --> 00:37:55.280
to low income neighborhoods,
to minority neighborhoods.

00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:58.890
Maxine Waters, congresswoman
from California

00:37:58.890 --> 00:38:02.090
was part of this same group of people,

00:38:02.090 --> 00:38:06.920
and so essentially, what
happened was that Congress

00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:11.020
started putting pressure
on Fannie and Freddie Mac,

00:38:11.020 --> 00:38:14.900
which is a, Freddie Mac is a
younger and smaller Fannie Mae

00:38:14.900 --> 00:38:19.310
created in 1970 to have some
competition in this market,

00:38:19.310 --> 00:38:22.350
but essentially, Congress, under pressure

00:38:22.350 --> 00:38:26.640
from these kinds of people in Congress

00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:31.307
was saying that you have only to make,

00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:38.920
you have only to make
Fannie Mae funds available

00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:41.640
in subprime mortgage markets.

00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:44.630
That is what bankers would
call subprime mortgage markets

00:38:44.630 --> 00:38:47.790
in minority neighborhoods,
in poorer neighborhoods,

00:38:47.790 --> 00:38:50.950
and then came relentless pressure

00:38:50.950 --> 00:38:54.189
to make the subprime more and more sub,

00:38:54.189 --> 00:38:59.189
so reducing down payments
from 20% to 10% to 5%,

00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:02.343
eventually to next to nothing.

00:39:03.370 --> 00:39:08.370
And again, using non-traditional criteria

00:39:08.690 --> 00:39:12.790
for granting people mortgages

00:39:12.790 --> 00:39:17.120
in terms of evaluations
of their credit and so on.

00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:21.450
And when people say, oh, so
it's actually the government

00:39:21.450 --> 00:39:23.550
that caused the financial crisis,

00:39:23.550 --> 00:39:25.810
which conservative sometimes argue,

00:39:25.810 --> 00:39:27.280
this is what they're talking about.

00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:29.180
Because they're essentially saying

00:39:29.180 --> 00:39:32.710
that these practices by Fannie and Freddie

00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:35.450
distorted the whole mortgage market

00:39:35.450 --> 00:39:38.940
because they, after all,

00:39:38.940 --> 00:39:41.230
even though they are publicly traded,

00:39:41.230 --> 00:39:43.390
are underwritten by the taxpayer.

00:39:43.390 --> 00:39:47.690
So they can take more risk than they would

00:39:47.690 --> 00:39:50.640
if they were not
underwritten by the taxpayer.

00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:55.410
But that means that private sector lenders

00:39:55.410 --> 00:39:58.970
have to do the same thing if
they're gonna be competitive.

00:39:58.970 --> 00:40:02.350
So the argument gets
made that these practices

00:40:02.350 --> 00:40:05.740
distorted the entire mortgage market

00:40:05.740 --> 00:40:08.320
and create and even as the government

00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:10.400
started to get out of the business

00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:13.070
of securitizing subprime mortgages

00:40:13.070 --> 00:40:14.923
in the new millennium, nonetheless,

00:40:16.070 --> 00:40:18.360
they had already created this world

00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:20.700
in which the only way in which lenders

00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:25.700
could compete was by giving
more and more risky loans

00:40:26.100 --> 00:40:30.130
and further because of the
process of securitization,

00:40:30.130 --> 00:40:31.810
everybody underprice the risk

00:40:31.810 --> 00:40:33.923
because everybody was passing them on.

00:40:36.159 --> 00:40:38.460
It's one of the reasons
I think Alan Blinder

00:40:38.460 --> 00:40:40.707
called his book that I
was referring to last time

00:40:40.707 --> 00:40:44.380
"After the Music Stopped,"
you don't find out

00:40:44.380 --> 00:40:45.940
who doesn't have a chair to sit on

00:40:45.940 --> 00:40:48.363
until the music actually stops.

00:40:49.463 --> 00:40:54.463
And so that is what they,
that became the game.

00:40:55.260 --> 00:40:58.590
And there was enormous pressure

00:40:58.590 --> 00:41:01.450
in the Clinton administration
and it continued

00:41:01.450 --> 00:41:05.880
into the George W. Bush
administration as well.

00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:10.880
Again, pressure to reduce
underwriting standards and so on.

00:41:12.268 --> 00:41:17.227
And it was heralded just
as Clinton had heralded it

00:41:17.227 --> 00:41:21.740
and Bush had also heralded it as expanding

00:41:21.740 --> 00:41:25.110
the American dream into
minority communities

00:41:25.110 --> 00:41:28.230
and making home ownership available

00:41:28.230 --> 00:41:31.340
on a more equitable basis.

00:41:31.340 --> 00:41:33.790
So let's talk about the aftermath

00:41:33.790 --> 00:41:37.240
when it all came crashing
down for a minute.

00:41:37.240 --> 00:41:42.240
And I wanna have you listen
to a colleague of mine

00:41:42.860 --> 00:41:45.040
in economics department for a few minutes

00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:47.163
by the name of John Geanakoplos.

00:41:48.022 --> 00:41:52.290
He is one of the most
brilliant people at Yale.

00:41:52.290 --> 00:41:53.790
He's one of those people,

00:41:53.790 --> 00:41:55.743
if he's giving a paper, you just go.

00:41:56.600 --> 00:41:58.320
You know you'll learn something.

00:41:58.320 --> 00:42:03.070
He also happens to, he
happens to have a hedge fund

00:42:03.070 --> 00:42:06.750
that invests in mortgage
backed securities,

00:42:06.750 --> 00:42:08.550
so he knows whereof he speaks,

00:42:08.550 --> 00:42:13.550
and this is his post-mortem on
the subprime mortgage crisis.

00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:15.590
- Some errors.

00:42:15.590 --> 00:42:17.820
So what we did right, I guess,

00:42:17.820 --> 00:42:22.820
is we averted a complete
collapse of the banking sector,

00:42:23.610 --> 00:42:26.750
but that is also the source
of what we did wrong,

00:42:26.750 --> 00:42:30.160
because we were so obsessed with the banks

00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:32.520
that we forgot what caused the crisis,

00:42:32.520 --> 00:42:34.647
which was the subprime mortgage market

00:42:34.647 --> 00:42:36.550
and the mortgage market in general,

00:42:36.550 --> 00:42:39.370
home owners and what would
happen to home owners.

00:42:39.370 --> 00:42:44.370
So we've lost about four million
or five million households

00:42:46.270 --> 00:42:50.840
to the crisis who've been
thrown out of their houses,

00:42:50.840 --> 00:42:53.820
and another couple million
more that are on the way out

00:42:53.820 --> 00:42:58.020
that still haven't finished
with the foreclosure process.

00:42:58.020 --> 00:42:59.130
So altogether, they're gonna be

00:42:59.130 --> 00:43:01.260
something like six million or more,

00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:03.830
maybe even will get to
seven million households

00:43:03.830 --> 00:43:06.150
that will have lost their houses.

00:43:06.150 --> 00:43:08.900
If you're thinking three
people per household,

00:43:08.900 --> 00:43:11.523
maybe some people had multiple houses,

00:43:11.523 --> 00:43:12.480
so it might be a slight exaggeration,

00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:17.370
but we're talking about 20
million people lost their homes

00:43:17.370 --> 00:43:19.990
and who would've thought
that America would ever

00:43:19.990 --> 00:43:23.680
have to deal with 20 million
people losing their homes?

00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:25.090
And who would have had to deal

00:43:25.090 --> 00:43:29.030
with this long period of
stagnation and growth,

00:43:29.030 --> 00:43:31.250
which I think is related
to the housing crisis.

00:43:31.250 --> 00:43:33.740
So I think the biggest mistake we made

00:43:33.740 --> 00:43:35.510
was concentrating too much

00:43:35.510 --> 00:43:39.820
on the banks and recapitalizing the banks

00:43:39.820 --> 00:43:42.810
both during the crisis and still now

00:43:42.810 --> 00:43:45.620
and too little on helping the home owners,

00:43:45.620 --> 00:43:48.120
who I think were the heart of the crisis.

00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:52.330
So to give you an example,
we have a lot of data now

00:43:52.330 --> 00:43:54.670
on what happen to people
who lost their homes

00:43:54.670 --> 00:43:56.400
and what happen to the lenders.

00:43:56.400 --> 00:43:59.430
So a typical subprime loan might have been

00:43:59.430 --> 00:44:02.270
for say $160,000 and the house

00:44:02.270 --> 00:44:05.846
originally was worth a
little more than $160,000.

00:44:05.846 --> 00:44:08.810
But during the crisis, housing prices fell

00:44:08.810 --> 00:44:10.690
quite dramatically and that kind of house

00:44:10.690 --> 00:44:13.820
conceivably could have fallen to $100,000.

00:44:13.820 --> 00:44:16.317
So think of yourself
as a subprime borrower

00:44:16.317 --> 00:44:18.590
with a bad credit rating to begin with,

00:44:18.590 --> 00:44:21.600
that's why he is or she
is a subprime borrower,

00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:26.600
who owes 160,000 on a house
that's only worth 100,000

00:44:26.810 --> 00:44:29.380
in a time period where the future

00:44:29.380 --> 00:44:32.420
looks very bleak for
earning money, for example.

00:44:32.420 --> 00:44:37.420
It would be almost crazy for
such a person to keep paying.

00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:41.110
And in fact, most of the
people didn't continue paying

00:44:41.110 --> 00:44:45.020
for a while in 2008 and 2009.

00:44:45.020 --> 00:44:48.970
Six or, people now
position six or 7% a month,

00:44:48.970 --> 00:44:51.490
not a year, six or 7% a month

00:44:51.490 --> 00:44:53.290
were defaulting on their mortgages.

00:44:53.290 --> 00:44:56.230
So every month, there'd
be a new and different set

00:44:56.230 --> 00:45:00.010
of 6% or so who defaulted
on their mortgages.

00:45:00.010 --> 00:45:02.010
So what we did in most cases

00:45:02.010 --> 00:45:04.890
was tell them they'd stop paying.

00:45:04.890 --> 00:45:08.120
The Obama administration
might have lept in

00:45:08.120 --> 00:45:11.197
and said, "Oh, it must be
because you don't have a job,

00:45:11.197 --> 00:45:12.727
"we'll try to reduce your interest

00:45:12.727 --> 00:45:14.500
"payments for a little while."

00:45:14.500 --> 00:45:16.640
But so, imagine again you're that person

00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:19.370
who still owes 160,000, instead of paying

00:45:19.370 --> 00:45:22.700
8% a month, you now pay 4% a month.

00:45:22.700 --> 00:45:25.160
Your house is still worth only 100,000.

00:45:25.160 --> 00:45:29.180
So what happened was 50
to 80% of those people

00:45:29.180 --> 00:45:32.170
after about a year re-defaulted.

00:45:32.170 --> 00:45:35.040
So the plan of helping the homeowners

00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:37.570
by reducing their interest
payments for a while

00:45:37.570 --> 00:45:40.180
till they got over the bad times

00:45:40.180 --> 00:45:42.150
was completely unsuccessful.

00:45:42.150 --> 00:45:43.835
They defaulted.

00:45:43.835 --> 00:45:46.450
And what happened to the
lenders after the default?

00:45:46.450 --> 00:45:49.120
The homeowner didn't just
walk away from his house,

00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:51.150
he sat there until he was thrown out,

00:45:51.150 --> 00:45:54.030
which took on average almost three years,

00:45:54.030 --> 00:45:57.080
during which time the homeowner
didn't pay his mortgage,

00:45:57.080 --> 00:45:58.490
after he found he was
gonna lose his house,

00:45:58.490 --> 00:46:01.380
he didn't pay his mortgage,
he didn't pay his taxes,

00:46:01.380 --> 00:46:04.910
he didn't fix the house, and
on the way out of the house,

00:46:04.910 --> 00:46:06.480
maybe some things got taken

00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:08.890
or the house got ruined on the way out.

00:46:08.890 --> 00:46:12.970
So we have the data now, the
recovery in such a situation

00:46:12.970 --> 00:46:17.800
was in fact, on all the
subprime loans was under 25%.

00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:22.800
So the lender would've gotten
back 40,000 out of the 160.

00:46:22.950 --> 00:46:25.540
Had we forgiven some of the debt,

00:46:25.540 --> 00:46:28.490
had the lenders gotten
together and reduce the debt

00:46:28.490 --> 00:46:32.960
from 160 to 90 and maybe
even slightly subtle,

00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:35.647
more subtly said, "We'll
reduce your debt to 90,

00:46:35.647 --> 00:46:38.697
"but in case the house
goes back up in price,

00:46:38.697 --> 00:46:41.977
"we'll raise the debt, 50%
of the increase in the house

00:46:41.977 --> 00:46:44.400
"we'll add to the debt again."

00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:46.970
Had they done that, they
probably would've gotten their 90

00:46:46.970 --> 00:46:49.160
because the home owner now could've seen

00:46:49.160 --> 00:46:51.947
that his house was worth
more than the debt.

00:46:51.947 --> 00:46:54.349
At worse, the home owner
could've sold the house

00:46:54.349 --> 00:46:56.163
and pay back the 90 and kept 10.

00:46:57.133 --> 00:46:59.370
And so the home owner
would've been better off,

00:46:59.370 --> 00:47:01.210
the lenders would've been better off,

00:47:01.210 --> 00:47:03.440
because they would've
gotten 90 instead of 40,

00:47:03.440 --> 00:47:05.630
and the economy would've
been immeasurably better off,

00:47:05.630 --> 00:47:07.330
and by the way, the banks,
would've been better off,

00:47:07.330 --> 00:47:08.460
because that's where they were losing

00:47:08.460 --> 00:47:10.550
all their money in those kinds of loans.

00:47:10.550 --> 00:47:13.410
So I think our biggest
mistake was that we focused

00:47:13.410 --> 00:47:17.360
on the banking sector and
trying to recapitalize it

00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:19.270
and find enough money for the banks,

00:47:19.270 --> 00:47:21.950
and we didn't focus on the home owners

00:47:21.950 --> 00:47:25.240
whose debts were actually
owned by the banks

00:47:25.240 --> 00:47:26.320
and who were gonna determine

00:47:26.320 --> 00:47:28.170
the fate of the banks at the end anyway.

00:47:28.170 --> 00:47:29.800
And we would've done much better

00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:31.270
concentrating on the home owners.

00:47:31.270 --> 00:47:34.100
I think that is the major mistake,

00:47:34.100 --> 00:47:38.150
major policy blunder that the
Obama administration made.

00:47:38.150 --> 00:47:42.070
And they made it not because
it never occurred to them,

00:47:42.070 --> 00:47:45.350
because people like
me, and I wasn't alone,

00:47:45.350 --> 00:47:46.817
went and talk to them and said,

00:47:46.817 --> 00:47:49.080
"This is what you should do."

00:47:49.080 --> 00:47:51.940
I even testified in Congress a few times.

00:47:51.940 --> 00:47:54.690
And it's not just academics like me

00:47:54.690 --> 00:47:57.880
who were saying things like that,

00:47:57.880 --> 00:48:01.440
it was the business people who
were making the investments

00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:03.010
and who effectively owned the loans

00:48:03.010 --> 00:48:05.400
who also wanted to see the debt forgiven.

00:48:05.400 --> 00:48:09.894
This isn't some pie in
the sky, academic idea,

00:48:09.894 --> 00:48:12.550
there were a number of hedge funds,

00:48:12.550 --> 00:48:15.410
these mortgages, they're
not done individually.

00:48:15.410 --> 00:48:17.484
A bank may give the mortgage,

00:48:17.484 --> 00:48:19.790
but the banks then sells
the mortgage into a pool,

00:48:19.790 --> 00:48:21.600
and it's the shareholders of the pool

00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:23.360
who are effectively lending the money,

00:48:23.360 --> 00:48:24.960
the bank is just the middle man.

00:48:25.828 --> 00:48:27.410
So a bunch of, but these bondholders,

00:48:27.410 --> 00:48:29.530
shareholders of the pools,
they don't know each other,

00:48:29.530 --> 00:48:32.620
so it's very difficult for them
to coordinate any activity.

00:48:32.620 --> 00:48:35.160
That's why we need the
government to coordinate things

00:48:35.160 --> 00:48:37.970
that are difficult to
coordinate otherwise.

00:48:37.970 --> 00:48:41.750
So a bunch of those hedge
funds and other investors

00:48:41.750 --> 00:48:44.480
also testified in Congress
that they would like to see

00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:46.600
the debt forgiven not
because they were good guys

00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:47.770
but because it would help them

00:48:47.770 --> 00:48:49.363
as well as helping the economy.

00:48:50.412 --> 00:48:52.230
And we just weren't
willing to be bold enough

00:48:52.230 --> 00:48:54.730
to listen to those voices
and we didn't take,

00:48:54.730 --> 00:48:57.030
I think, the most important
step we could have

00:48:57.900 --> 00:49:02.900
to make the ensuing
recession less dramatic.

00:49:09.950 --> 00:49:14.950
- So why didn't the politicians
take Geanakoplos's advice?

00:49:18.380 --> 00:49:22.430
He's saying it would've
been an all around win.

00:49:22.430 --> 00:49:25.950
The banks, the home owners,

00:49:25.950 --> 00:49:28.683
the investors would all
have been better off.

00:49:30.360 --> 00:49:32.390
Why didn't the government do that?

00:49:32.390 --> 00:49:33.223
Any,

00:49:35.450 --> 00:49:37.680
any thoughts about why?

00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:38.513
Yeah?

00:49:41.470 --> 00:49:44.100
- [Student] I just feel
that everyone thought

00:49:44.100 --> 00:49:47.190
that they had a good
thing going at that point,

00:49:47.190 --> 00:49:50.750
and they didn't want to put
a monkey wrench in there.

00:49:50.750 --> 00:49:54.540
- Well, but this is when
we were having mortgages

00:49:54.540 --> 00:49:57.243
defaulting at a very alarming rate.

00:49:58.110 --> 00:49:59.960
So that can't be the story.

00:49:59.960 --> 00:50:01.283
Any, yeah?

00:50:08.660 --> 00:50:09.630
- [Student] For me, this is akin

00:50:09.630 --> 00:50:11.240
to getting away with murder.

00:50:11.240 --> 00:50:14.580
So if you know that you can taken a loan

00:50:14.580 --> 00:50:16.210
and they'll cut it to half,

00:50:16.210 --> 00:50:17.650
then why pay the loan at all,

00:50:17.650 --> 00:50:19.920
'cause you know you can get away with it.

00:50:19.920 --> 00:50:23.203
- So you're worried about
the moral hazard problem.

00:50:27.750 --> 00:50:30.090
Well, let's hear elaboration

00:50:30.090 --> 00:50:32.063
of the moral hazard problem here.

00:50:33.060 --> 00:50:35.220
- I tell you what, I have an idea.

00:50:35.220 --> 00:50:38.370
The new administration's big
on computers and technology,

00:50:38.370 --> 00:50:41.050
how about this, President,
new administration,

00:50:41.050 --> 00:50:43.360
why don't you put up a
website to have people

00:50:43.360 --> 00:50:45.830
vote on the internet as a referendum

00:50:45.830 --> 00:50:49.230
to see if we really wanna
subsidize the loser's mortgages

00:50:49.230 --> 00:50:52.960
or would we like to at least
buy cars and buy houses

00:50:52.960 --> 00:50:55.230
in foreclosure and give 'em to people

00:50:55.230 --> 00:50:58.100
that might have a chance to
actually prosper down the road

00:50:58.100 --> 00:51:01.300
and reward people that
could carry the water

00:51:01.300 --> 00:51:02.827
instead of drink the water.

00:51:02.827 --> 00:51:04.760
- Hey Rick, it's a novel idea.

00:51:04.760 --> 00:51:08.690
- Hey, Rick--
(others mumbling)

00:51:08.690 --> 00:51:11.040
They're like putty in your hands.

00:51:11.040 --> 00:51:12.340
Did you hear--
- No, they're not, Joe.

00:51:12.340 --> 00:51:13.870
They're not like putty in our hands.

00:51:13.870 --> 00:51:16.030
This is America, how many of you people

00:51:16.030 --> 00:51:18.110
wanna pay for your neighbor's mortgage

00:51:18.110 --> 00:51:20.800
that has an extra bathroom
and can't pay their bills,

00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:22.902
raise their hand, hello, we all.

00:51:22.902 --> 00:51:24.590
(others booing)

00:51:24.590 --> 00:51:27.230
President Obama, are you listening?

00:51:27.230 --> 00:51:28.900
- How about we all stop
paying our mortgage?

00:51:28.900 --> 00:51:30.390
It's a moral hazard.

00:51:30.390 --> 00:51:31.900
- Hey, Rick, how about the notion

00:51:31.900 --> 00:51:35.640
that Will reported that
you can go down to 2%

00:51:35.640 --> 00:51:37.080
on the mortgage--
- You could go down

00:51:37.080 --> 00:51:40.353
to minus 2%, they can't afford the house.

00:51:40.353 --> 00:51:41.810
- And still have 40% not be able to do it,

00:51:41.810 --> 00:51:42.840
so why are they in the house?

00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:44.393
Why are we trying to
keep 'em in the house?

00:51:44.393 --> 00:51:45.910
- I know Mr. Summers is a great economist,

00:51:45.910 --> 00:51:48.003
but boy, I love the answer to that one.

00:51:49.830 --> 00:51:54.050
- Jason, Jason--
- You're thinking

00:51:54.050 --> 00:51:56.890
of having a Chicago Tea Party in July,

00:51:56.890 --> 00:51:58.420
all you capitalists that wanna show up

00:51:58.420 --> 00:52:01.821
at the Lake Michigan, I'm
gonna start organizing.

00:52:01.821 --> 00:52:02.697
(someone whistling)
- What are you jumping--

00:52:03.870 --> 00:52:08.200
- So that is so-called
Rick Santelli's rant.

00:52:08.200 --> 00:52:11.830
He is a financial commentator,

00:52:11.830 --> 00:52:15.330
that was a morning on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange

00:52:15.330 --> 00:52:18.890
in February of 2009,
the Obama administration

00:52:18.890 --> 00:52:23.700
had just taken office
and it's a famous rant

00:52:23.700 --> 00:52:27.790
because you've heard him
calling for a tea party in July

00:52:27.790 --> 00:52:32.500
and that is often
credited with galvanizing

00:52:32.500 --> 00:52:36.480
what became the Tea Party
movement, Rick Santelli's rant.

00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:38.960
Although some people dispute and say

00:52:38.960 --> 00:52:41.420
his influence has been exaggerated,

00:52:41.420 --> 00:52:46.420
but it's become emblematic of
the scorched earth resistance

00:52:47.390 --> 00:52:50.550
to doing anything remotely like that.

00:52:50.550 --> 00:52:55.550
And so one argument he's making there

00:52:55.660 --> 00:52:57.563
is the moral hazard argument.

00:52:58.538 --> 00:53:00.663
Now, people like Geanakoplos and others,

00:53:02.140 --> 00:53:05.763
they weren't entirely
ignorant of such things,

00:53:07.740 --> 00:53:09.420
and there were ways to address it,

00:53:09.420 --> 00:53:13.800
namely first of all,
to point out to people

00:53:13.800 --> 00:53:18.800
that if you didn't write down these loans,

00:53:19.140 --> 00:53:21.023
say of your neighbor's home,

00:53:21.870 --> 00:53:24.350
your house has become even worse,

00:53:24.350 --> 00:53:26.590
even, it's gonna lose value,

00:53:26.590 --> 00:53:29.090
because it's gonna be
next to a decrepit house.

00:53:29.090 --> 00:53:33.570
And secondly, the people who
did get mortgage assistance,

00:53:33.570 --> 00:53:38.010
for example, what the government,
as John Geanakoplos said,

00:53:38.010 --> 00:53:40.760
they would give them a lower
interest rate for a while,

00:53:40.760 --> 00:53:44.270
it didn't work because of the underlying

00:53:44.270 --> 00:53:46.080
incentives didn't line up,

00:53:46.080 --> 00:53:48.630
but they were put
through humiliating hell.

00:53:48.630 --> 00:53:51.660
It wasn't like you just filled out a form

00:53:51.660 --> 00:53:56.660
and said, now I get my mortgage reduced,

00:53:56.857 --> 00:53:58.920
or my interest rate reduced,

00:53:58.920 --> 00:53:59.753
you went through

00:54:02.552 --> 00:54:05.440
endless interviews with people

00:54:05.440 --> 00:54:07.970
that made you prove your need,

00:54:07.970 --> 00:54:10.930
this is like the sorts
of humiliating things

00:54:10.930 --> 00:54:13.175
people have to go through

00:54:13.175 --> 00:54:15.600
to get out of government assistance.

00:54:15.600 --> 00:54:20.220
So the argument was that there are ways

00:54:21.950 --> 00:54:24.210
to manage the moral hazard, if you like,

00:54:24.210 --> 00:54:29.010
even if you can't make
it entirely go away.

00:54:29.010 --> 00:54:33.260
But the Rick Santelli's
rant, I think is instructive

00:54:33.260 --> 00:54:38.260
for other reasons, which is, go back to,

00:54:38.440 --> 00:54:41.680
remember our discussion
of the Capuchin monkeys

00:54:41.680 --> 00:54:44.750
when I said that the researcher

00:54:44.750 --> 00:54:49.223
misinterpreted the
result of his experiment

00:54:51.330 --> 00:54:53.950
when he said that the angry monkey

00:54:53.950 --> 00:54:56.520
was like a Wall Street protester,

00:54:56.520 --> 00:55:00.560
and it's really people make
much more local comparisons,

00:55:00.560 --> 00:55:04.990
and it's the idea even if
you're gonna be worse off

00:55:04.990 --> 00:55:07.580
because your house is
gonna get less valuable

00:55:07.580 --> 00:55:10.900
being next to a dilapidated house,

00:55:10.900 --> 00:55:12.960
you make the local comparison

00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:16.820
and that becomes the
source of your resentment.

00:55:16.820 --> 00:55:21.480
And so for this reason,
the kind of proposal

00:55:21.480 --> 00:55:26.480
that Geanakoplos and others
were pushing is dead on arrival.

00:55:26.990 --> 00:55:29.240
Even though people are
gonna have to actually

00:55:29.240 --> 00:55:32.740
take an absolute hit for refusing

00:55:32.740 --> 00:55:35.490
this kind of assistance,

00:55:35.490 --> 00:55:40.070
it's not gonna possible to
mobilize them behind that.

00:55:40.070 --> 00:55:42.820
And it might not surprise
you to know that,

00:55:42.820 --> 00:55:45.250
you maybe can guess from his name

00:55:45.250 --> 00:55:50.250
that John Geanakoplos has
over the last number of years

00:55:52.050 --> 00:55:54.350
be in acting for the Greek government

00:55:54.350 --> 00:55:59.350
in its dealings with the
IMF and the European banks

00:55:59.360 --> 00:56:02.090
where he's made exactly the same argument.

00:56:02.090 --> 00:56:07.090
He said the Greeks cannot pay their debts

00:56:07.610 --> 00:56:10.760
and you should write the principal down

00:56:10.760 --> 00:56:13.663
because all we're doing by,

00:56:14.829 --> 00:56:18.043
they just keep rescheduling
it into the future,

00:56:19.055 --> 00:56:20.400
they're not solving the problem.

00:56:20.400 --> 00:56:25.320
What they should be doing is
saying for every euro you pay,

00:56:25.320 --> 00:56:28.270
we will forgive the principal
you owe by two euros,

00:56:28.270 --> 00:56:29.430
or something like that.

00:56:29.430 --> 00:56:32.710
And it won't surprise
you to know that he's got

00:56:32.710 --> 00:56:36.290
no further defending the Greek government

00:56:36.290 --> 00:56:38.820
than he got defending the home owners

00:56:38.820 --> 00:56:41.400
during the mortgage crisis.

00:56:41.400 --> 00:56:46.230
And that is because
brilliant economist as he is,

00:56:46.230 --> 00:56:49.760
he's not paying enough attention

00:56:49.760 --> 00:56:52.720
to the politics of the situation

00:56:52.720 --> 00:56:56.710
and the resentment that
would get generated

00:56:59.100 --> 00:57:03.500
if the government did do
this on a significant scale.

00:57:03.500 --> 00:57:07.090
So even though it makes
pristine economic sense

00:57:07.090 --> 00:57:09.900
and Geanakoplos is right that everybody

00:57:09.900 --> 00:57:11.310
would have been better off,

00:57:11.310 --> 00:57:15.383
it was something that was
politically was dead on arrival.

00:57:16.240 --> 00:57:19.900
And that's scarcely surprising.

00:57:19.900 --> 00:57:22.570
It should also just be said

00:57:22.570 --> 00:57:26.150
that the banks were divided about this.

00:57:26.150 --> 00:57:29.866
They were not as united
as that clip suggests.

00:57:29.866 --> 00:57:31.250
Some of them actually preferred

00:57:31.250 --> 00:57:35.310
the wholesale buyouts,
bailouts of the banks

00:57:35.310 --> 00:57:38.560
rather than worrying
about the home owners,

00:57:38.560 --> 00:57:41.270
partly because there would've
been quite substantial

00:57:41.270 --> 00:57:45.408
transaction cost to doing
it they would have had,

00:57:45.408 --> 00:57:48.440
because the mortgages
are owned by many people

00:57:48.440 --> 00:57:53.090
and so how you're actually
coordinate the writing down.

00:57:53.090 --> 00:57:57.090
At the end of the day, the
really simple way to do it

00:57:57.090 --> 00:57:58.830
would be even harder politically,

00:57:58.830 --> 00:58:01.330
which namely the government
would've just given

00:58:01.330 --> 00:58:03.740
the money to the home owners,

00:58:03.740 --> 00:58:06.370
written them a check, but again, I think,

00:58:06.370 --> 00:58:10.010
for reasons we're gonna go into next week,

00:58:10.010 --> 00:58:11.880
for government to give people checks

00:58:11.880 --> 00:58:14.680
is politically very difficult.

00:58:14.680 --> 00:58:18.210
There's also, was also
some sunk cost fallacy,

00:58:18.210 --> 00:58:21.270
so this is related to loss aversion

00:58:21.270 --> 00:58:23.543
that I've talked to you about,

00:58:23.543 --> 00:58:26.843
which is if a lender writes down a debt,

00:58:27.960 --> 00:58:30.083
you're admitting you made a bad loan.

00:58:31.993 --> 00:58:33.900
Whereas if you hope against hope

00:58:33.900 --> 00:58:36.691
that the market's gonna come back,

00:58:36.691 --> 00:58:41.691
you will not have to own the
fact that you made a bad loan.

00:58:43.610 --> 00:58:46.090
So you see this all the time,

00:58:46.090 --> 00:58:47.460
an economist will tell you

00:58:47.460 --> 00:58:50.570
if you're trying to decide whether or not

00:58:50.570 --> 00:58:53.760
to sell a stock, the only
important question is

00:58:53.760 --> 00:58:55.450
what is it gonna be worth in the future

00:58:55.450 --> 00:58:57.460
if I don't sell it today.

00:58:57.460 --> 00:58:59.590
But nine of 10 people will focus

00:58:59.590 --> 00:59:01.640
on what did I pay for this stock.

00:59:01.640 --> 00:59:03.040
It's the wrong question.

00:59:03.040 --> 00:59:06.140
For an economist, it's a
completely irrelevant question

00:59:06.140 --> 00:59:07.920
what I paid for the stock,

00:59:07.920 --> 00:59:12.430
but Kahneman inference, a
psychologist who understands

00:59:14.100 --> 00:59:17.860
the human psychic cost
of internalizing the fact

00:59:17.860 --> 00:59:19.320
that you've lost something

00:59:20.230 --> 00:59:23.680
means that you will irrationally ignore

00:59:24.540 --> 00:59:26.980
the data that you should
be paying attention to,

00:59:26.980 --> 00:59:30.120
which is not what did I pay for it,

00:59:30.120 --> 00:59:32.340
but whether, what, if
I don't sell it today,

00:59:32.340 --> 00:59:35.100
what will I be able to
sell it for tomorrow.

00:59:35.100 --> 00:59:39.830
So it wasn't only the
issue that Geanakoplos

00:59:39.830 --> 00:59:42.590
was speaking about, but certainly,

00:59:42.590 --> 00:59:46.260
that was a significant part of it.

00:59:46.260 --> 00:59:51.260
So what do we to make of all of this.

00:59:51.270 --> 00:59:54.280
So here, we've had this long history,

00:59:54.280 --> 00:59:57.610
as I said, the transition
from hard to soft apartheid

00:59:57.610 --> 01:00:01.830
did not get rid of class-based

01:00:01.830 --> 01:00:05.610
and race-based discrimination
in housing markets,

01:00:05.610 --> 01:00:08.320
it just made it more
difficult to deal with.

01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:11.870
Here we had decades where
success of administrations,

01:00:11.870 --> 01:00:15.100
Democratic, Republican,
Democratic, Republican,

01:00:15.100 --> 01:00:18.500
sought to address this problem

01:00:18.500 --> 01:00:22.760
by first outlawing discrimination

01:00:22.760 --> 01:00:27.292
based on neighborhood and discrimination

01:00:27.292 --> 01:00:31.563
in who you would give mortgages to.

01:00:32.510 --> 01:00:36.500
This created all this
pressure on Fannie Mae

01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:39.630
from the federal government to restructure

01:00:39.630 --> 01:00:44.233
mortgage markets to make them
more friendly to minorities,

01:00:44.233 --> 01:00:47.930
but when we look at how
this all played out,

01:00:47.930 --> 01:00:50.550
it's not a happy story, if you look here,

01:00:50.550 --> 01:00:53.623
the run up to the financial crisis here,

01:00:55.660 --> 01:01:00.047
you can see that African
Americans and Hispanics

01:01:05.460 --> 01:01:09.590
received a great majority of the increase

01:01:09.590 --> 01:01:12.373
in subprime mortgages.

01:01:13.632 --> 01:01:17.440
And if you look into the
aftermath of the crisis,

01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:20.040
when everything came crashing down,

01:01:20.040 --> 01:01:22.380
Blacks were 47% more likely

01:01:22.380 --> 01:01:24.850
to be facing foreclosure than Whites,

01:01:24.850 --> 01:01:29.850
Latinos were 45% more likely
to be facing foreclosure.

01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:32.060
If you look at the loss of property,

01:01:32.060 --> 01:01:36.620
you see from 2007 to nine,

01:01:36.620 --> 01:01:40.040
nearly 8% of both African
Americans and Latinos

01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:42.133
lost their homes to foreclosures,

01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:45.770
basically double the rate of Whites.

01:01:45.770 --> 01:01:48.260
African Americans were 80% more likely

01:01:48.260 --> 01:01:52.110
to lose their homes compared
to similarly situated Whites

01:01:52.110 --> 01:01:57.110
and Latinos was 70% more,
and if you look, more likely.

01:01:57.449 --> 01:02:00.900
And if you look at the recovery after the,

01:02:00.900 --> 01:02:02.720
that I ended with last time,

01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:07.720
you can see again that
this is household wealth.

01:02:12.020 --> 01:02:16.860
By 2009, it was starting
already to turn around

01:02:16.860 --> 01:02:21.860
for Whites but not so
for African Americans.

01:02:22.860 --> 01:02:26.250
If you look at changes in home equity,

01:02:26.250 --> 01:02:30.700
you can see that in the
run-up to the crisis,

01:02:30.700 --> 01:02:35.700
Whites represented there by the blue bar,

01:02:38.920 --> 01:02:43.710
their increase in equity
slowed relative to Blacks,

01:02:43.710 --> 01:02:48.710
but in the crash, the Whites lost less

01:02:49.370 --> 01:02:52.123
and turned around more quickly,

01:02:54.070 --> 01:02:55.630
turned around more quickly

01:02:55.630 --> 01:02:57.710
than it did for African Americans.

01:02:57.710 --> 01:03:02.710
So not entirely a straightforward story.

01:03:02.740 --> 01:03:07.430
In fact, in 2016, right at the end

01:03:07.430 --> 01:03:09.000
of the Obama administration,

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.180
they did start doing a little bit

01:03:11.180 --> 01:03:13.910
of what Geanakoplos had been advocating.

01:03:13.910 --> 01:03:16.570
Fannie and Freddie
approved a one-time plan

01:03:16.570 --> 01:03:18.710
to reduce mortgage balances

01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:25.963
with unpaid principal
balances of 250,000 or less,

01:03:27.090 --> 01:03:32.090
but 33,000 home owners
were expected to qualify,

01:03:33.395 --> 01:03:36.390
many fewer than that actually
took advantage of it.

01:03:36.390 --> 01:03:39.280
They also, in their
settlements with banks,

01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:43.100
the government gave the
banks some incentives

01:03:43.100 --> 01:03:44.550
to write down principal.

01:03:44.550 --> 01:03:49.550
In 2013, they gave JP
Morgan Chase $1.15 credit

01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:53.040
towards its huge settlement

01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:55.270
for every dollar of loan forgiveness

01:03:55.270 --> 01:03:56.830
that they offered home owners.

01:03:56.830 --> 01:04:00.540
So they did, and they did a
similar thing with Goldman.

01:04:00.540 --> 01:04:03.860
So they did do a little
bit of this at the margin,

01:04:03.860 --> 01:04:05.640
but nothing on the scale

01:04:05.640 --> 01:04:09.670
that would have made
a dent in the problem.

01:04:09.670 --> 01:04:14.420
And if you look at
projections of the effect

01:04:14.420 --> 01:04:19.420
that this has had on the creation
of wealth into the future,

01:04:22.490 --> 01:04:27.490
you can again see that this big wallop

01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:29.880
that African Americans have taken

01:04:31.140 --> 01:04:35.295
during the collapse is gonna cost them

01:04:35.295 --> 01:04:38.580
and their children for many
decades into the future,

01:04:38.580 --> 01:04:43.280
I'm not sure projections
this far out worth that much

01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:45.100
and so I wouldn't put too much stock

01:04:45.100 --> 01:04:47.173
by the absolute numbers,

01:04:48.070 --> 01:04:51.000
but the general trend is clear.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:54.620
If you look, this is
the peak to the trough.

01:04:54.620 --> 01:04:57.710
You can see African
Americans and Hispanics

01:04:57.710 --> 01:05:01.470
lost more value in their homes,

01:05:01.470 --> 01:05:05.440
and then the trough to the
peak, they gained back less.

01:05:05.440 --> 01:05:10.310
And we see, if you look at
home ownership rights by race,

01:05:10.310 --> 01:05:12.513
you can see that African Americans,

01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:16.860
again, the pink line on that graph

01:05:17.770 --> 01:05:22.770
have fallen to levels that
hadn't existed for many decades.

01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:28.570
And this has produced a new
rounds of outrage in people,

01:05:28.570 --> 01:05:30.850
you could be saying, here we go again.

01:05:30.850 --> 01:05:34.040
These are some headlines
from newspapers last year

01:05:34.040 --> 01:05:37.710
complaining that Black home
ownership is as low as it was

01:05:37.710 --> 01:05:41.930
when housing discrimination was legal

01:05:41.930 --> 01:05:43.700
and Black home ownership rates

01:05:43.700 --> 01:05:47.300
are where they were 50 years ago.

01:05:47.300 --> 01:05:50.567
The Urban Institute, a
liberal think tank says,

01:05:50.567 --> 01:05:52.227
"We've made important progress,

01:05:52.227 --> 01:05:55.477
"but we can't claim to have
vanished housing discrimination

01:05:55.477 --> 01:05:58.430
"and its pernicious effects."

01:05:58.430 --> 01:06:03.430
And so here we are again, we
are starting to see pressure

01:06:03.880 --> 01:06:08.880
to make home ownership available
to less advantaged groups.

01:06:14.020 --> 01:06:17.350
Now you might say, well why is
home ownership so important,

01:06:17.350 --> 01:06:22.350
why is it centrally associated
with the American dream?

01:06:24.230 --> 01:06:29.230
And anyone wanna take a shot at that?

01:06:29.580 --> 01:06:33.463
Why do we, why do people care
about home ownership so much?

01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:38.503
Why is it important
that people own a home?

01:06:40.394 --> 01:06:44.718
- [Student] Financial security.

01:06:44.718 --> 01:06:47.490
- Financial security is one answer.

01:06:47.490 --> 01:06:50.570
We'll see how much financial
security it really gives them.

01:06:50.570 --> 01:06:52.760
- [Student] It's a major
avenue for wealth creation.

01:06:52.760 --> 01:06:54.540
- Pardon?
- Wealth creation.

01:06:54.540 --> 01:06:57.120
- Okay, so let's start with that.

01:06:57.120 --> 01:07:00.870
People think that home, it's
a way of creating wealth

01:07:00.870 --> 01:07:03.190
because most people believe

01:07:03.190 --> 01:07:07.410
that the value of homes always goes up.

01:07:07.410 --> 01:07:10.210
People believe that, that's one reason,

01:07:10.210 --> 01:07:14.456
but Shiller's book
"Irrational Exuberance",

01:07:14.456 --> 01:07:16.820
this is Robert Shiller, our colleague

01:07:16.820 --> 01:07:19.900
in the Economic Department,
a Nobel Prize winner,

01:07:19.900 --> 01:07:24.380
he wrote a book, this book
"Irrational Exuberance" in 2000

01:07:24.380 --> 01:07:27.340
right before the dot com bubble burst

01:07:27.340 --> 01:07:31.290
and predicted the dot
com bubble would burst.

01:07:31.290 --> 01:07:33.930
He then wrote a second edition in 2006

01:07:35.490 --> 01:07:37.160
about the mortgage market saying

01:07:37.160 --> 01:07:40.540
they're gonna collapse, and they did.

01:07:40.540 --> 01:07:43.890
You might say, "Why don't
people listen to Shiller?"

01:07:43.890 --> 01:07:46.380
I did hear one economist opine once

01:07:46.380 --> 01:07:48.620
the trouble with Shiller
is that he's predicted

01:07:48.620 --> 01:07:51.515
nine of the last three recessions.

01:07:51.515 --> 01:07:54.790
(students laughing)
But the most famous,

01:07:54.790 --> 01:07:58.360
the most famous graph in
Shiller's book is this one

01:07:59.560 --> 01:08:04.560
where he points out that if you
deflate nominal prices from,

01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:12.760
you control for inflation and you,

01:08:12.910 --> 01:08:15.730
basically the story is that the real value

01:08:15.730 --> 01:08:17.413
of homes does not change,

01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:21.400
they've been flagged for over a century.

01:08:21.400 --> 01:08:23.160
So people think it's gonna go up,

01:08:23.160 --> 01:08:25.660
you might say why would people
think they're gonna go up,

01:08:25.660 --> 01:08:28.760
the price of nothing else just goes up,

01:08:28.760 --> 01:08:31.230
and people would have theories like,

01:08:31.230 --> 01:08:33.850
well, populations are growing and so on,

01:08:33.850 --> 01:08:36.870
but as Shiller points out,

01:08:36.870 --> 01:08:40.480
you've also got a factory and
cost of building comes down,

01:08:40.480 --> 01:08:43.920
all sorts of things, but
so it's just not true.

01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:46.210
It's just not true that assets keep,

01:08:46.210 --> 01:08:50.040
that homes, that real
estate keeps appreciating.

01:08:50.040 --> 01:08:53.460
Goes up and down like other things

01:08:53.460 --> 01:08:57.540
and the actual deflated value by inflation

01:08:57.540 --> 01:09:02.540
is more or less flat
over the last century.

01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:07.030
Another reason you might
think it would lead

01:09:07.030 --> 01:09:12.030
to building up security is
that people are forced to save.

01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:18.080
Americans are notoriously bad savers,

01:09:18.080 --> 01:09:21.350
and if you spend, every month,

01:09:21.350 --> 01:09:22.760
you're sending in your mortgage payment,

01:09:22.760 --> 01:09:25.680
you're paying, you're
building up that nest egg,

01:09:25.680 --> 01:09:28.640
it's forced saving,
so-called the third leg

01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:30.440
in the three legged stool

01:09:30.440 --> 01:09:32.460
that you're gonna need for retirement.

01:09:32.460 --> 01:09:36.943
The other being social security
and your private pension.

01:09:37.856 --> 01:09:39.310
So you build up the nest egg.

01:09:39.310 --> 01:09:43.500
The trouble with this theory
is that it's no longer true.

01:09:43.500 --> 01:09:45.410
And it's no longer true principally

01:09:45.410 --> 01:09:49.150
because of the 1986 Tax Reform.

01:09:49.150 --> 01:09:53.360
The 1986 Tax Reform
was, tax simplification

01:09:57.150 --> 01:10:02.150
was the big issue in
the 1986 Tax Reform law.

01:10:04.971 --> 01:10:08.115
So they were trying to, this
is the Reagan administration,

01:10:08.115 --> 01:10:10.270
they were trying to
greatly simplify the code

01:10:10.270 --> 01:10:14.093
and among other things, they
sought to get rid of the home,

01:10:15.290 --> 01:10:19.940
deductions off your taxes
for paying interest on debts.

01:10:19.940 --> 01:10:22.710
And so they were gonna get rid
of all interest deductions.

01:10:22.710 --> 01:10:25.470
They rapidly ran into the buzzsaw,

01:10:25.470 --> 01:10:28.910
which is that the mortgage,

01:10:28.910 --> 01:10:32.750
the banking lobby is extremely powerful

01:10:33.855 --> 01:10:38.340
and the real estate
industry's extremely powerful,

01:10:38.340 --> 01:10:40.890
and they were strongly
opposed to getting rid

01:10:40.890 --> 01:10:44.160
of the deductibility of home
interest mortgage deduction.

01:10:44.160 --> 01:10:46.410
But the '86 Act did get rid

01:10:46.410 --> 01:10:48.990
of credit card interest deduction.

01:10:48.990 --> 01:10:51.490
Used to be until '86, you could have,

01:10:51.490 --> 01:10:52.870
whatever interest you were paying

01:10:52.870 --> 01:10:54.630
on your Visa card was deductible,

01:10:54.630 --> 01:10:57.473
just like your mortgage
interest is deductible.

01:10:58.640 --> 01:11:03.640
And so the '86 Act got rid
of deduction for credit cards

01:11:03.980 --> 01:11:07.370
and not for home owners, for mortgages.

01:11:07.370 --> 01:11:11.160
Well, enter the HELOC, HELOC,

01:11:11.160 --> 01:11:13.303
you could all remember HELOCs, right.

01:11:14.372 --> 01:11:15.680
The home equity loans.

01:11:15.680 --> 01:11:18.610
So what people would
then do is essentially

01:11:18.610 --> 01:11:21.180
borrow out the equity in their house,

01:11:21.180 --> 01:11:23.020
pay off their credit cards with it

01:11:23.020 --> 01:11:25.930
or spend it on vacations
in the south of France

01:11:25.930 --> 01:11:30.930
or whatever it was, and then
the HELOC would be deductible.

01:11:32.150 --> 01:11:35.803
And so what people started to do was to,

01:11:36.850 --> 01:11:40.780
if you like, the government
gave them a big incentive

01:11:40.780 --> 01:11:45.130
to raid the nest egg, and so
the net result of this was,

01:11:45.130 --> 01:11:49.050
after '86, people would regularly
refinance their mortgages,

01:11:49.050 --> 01:11:51.910
borrow out the equity, and so in effect,

01:11:51.910 --> 01:11:53.940
there wasn't gonna be a,

01:11:53.940 --> 01:11:57.390
there isn't gonna be a nest egg there

01:12:00.349 --> 01:12:02.950
whenever you finally sell the house,

01:12:02.950 --> 01:12:05.710
people essentially were financing this.

01:12:05.710 --> 01:12:07.360
And of course, it should be said,

01:12:07.360 --> 01:12:09.160
going back to what I said right

01:12:09.160 --> 01:12:10.100
at the beginning of the course,

01:12:10.100 --> 01:12:13.550
and forward to what I'm gonna
be talking about next week,

01:12:13.550 --> 01:12:17.310
that as wages stagnated
and people were going

01:12:17.310 --> 01:12:19.630
from one income to two incomes

01:12:19.630 --> 01:12:23.010
to keep the same amount of
money coming in the door,

01:12:23.010 --> 01:12:26.230
the pressure to finance
current consumption

01:12:26.230 --> 01:12:31.230
out of one's home equity
would get ever stronger.

01:12:32.804 --> 01:12:35.520
And this is the source of Rosner,

01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:39.760
he teamed up with Gretchen
Morgenson to write that book

01:12:42.207 --> 01:12:44.280
"Reckless Endangerment" in 2011,

01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:47.000
that's the best political
book on the politics

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.740
of the financial crisis, I think,

01:12:49.740 --> 01:12:53.400
and certainly the best book
on the mortgage crisis.

01:12:53.400 --> 01:12:58.120
He had predicted in that
piece I posted in 2001

01:12:59.250 --> 01:13:04.010
that this market was gonna
become unsustainable.

01:13:04.010 --> 01:13:06.090
In that piece, the subtitle of which

01:13:06.090 --> 01:13:08.597
is called "Housing in the New Millennium"

01:13:08.597 --> 01:13:11.507
and the subtitle is "A Home Without Equity

01:13:11.507 --> 01:13:13.970
"Is Just a Mortgage with Debt."

01:13:13.970 --> 01:13:18.970
so it doesn't give you
any appreciating asset.

01:13:19.530 --> 01:13:20.913
A source of security.

01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:26.920
Not in an era of permanent
employment insecurity.

01:13:26.930 --> 01:13:31.930
So just, let's just listen to
John Travolta for a minute.

01:13:32.140 --> 01:13:34.160
- How many of you work
jobs that just pay the rent

01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:36.720
no matter how many hours you put in?

01:13:36.720 --> 01:13:37.790
I see.

01:13:37.790 --> 01:13:40.660
My momma worked jobs like
that after my daddy died.

01:13:40.660 --> 01:13:42.944
I remember her coming home from work

01:13:42.944 --> 01:13:45.854
just bummed, weary, you know what I mean.

01:13:45.854 --> 01:13:46.690
And I know she wanted to play with me

01:13:46.690 --> 01:13:48.550
and ask me about school,

01:13:48.550 --> 01:13:50.440
but sometimes you're just
too tired to do anything

01:13:50.440 --> 01:13:53.030
but heat up a TV dinner,
blob out in front of tube.

01:13:53.030 --> 01:13:55.130
- You got that one right.
- There you go.

01:13:56.380 --> 01:13:58.100
And I don't have to
tell you how hard it is

01:13:58.100 --> 01:13:59.100
to be looking for work.

01:13:59.100 --> 01:14:02.010
Hey, I don't have to tell you
anything about hard times.

01:14:02.010 --> 01:14:03.620
So you know what I'm gonna do?

01:14:03.620 --> 01:14:06.300
I'm gonna do something really outrageous.

01:14:06.300 --> 01:14:08.091
I'm gonna tell the truth.

01:14:08.091 --> 01:14:10.921
(audience applauding)

01:14:10.921 --> 01:14:12.359
I know, I know what you're thinking.

01:14:12.359 --> 01:14:14.380
You're thinking he must really
be desperate to do that,

01:14:14.380 --> 01:14:17.710
but if you had to swallow enough garbage--

01:14:17.710 --> 01:14:20.249
- You can say shit, we're X-rated.

01:14:20.249 --> 01:14:21.560
(audience laughing)

01:14:21.560 --> 01:14:24.378
- Yeah, me too, if you believe
what you read in the paper.

01:14:24.378 --> 01:14:28.628
(audience laughing and applauding)

01:14:32.983 --> 01:14:35.550
All right, here's the truth.

01:14:35.550 --> 01:14:37.870
No politician can reopen this factory

01:14:37.870 --> 01:14:39.870
or bring back the shipyard jobs

01:14:39.870 --> 01:14:41.570
or make your union strong again.

01:14:41.570 --> 01:14:44.370
No politician can make it
be the way it used to be

01:14:44.370 --> 01:14:46.110
because we're living in a new world now,

01:14:46.110 --> 01:14:48.020
a world without economic borders.

01:14:48.020 --> 01:14:49.570
A guy can push a button in New York

01:14:49.570 --> 01:14:50.910
and move a billion dollars in Tokyo

01:14:50.910 --> 01:14:51.930
in the blink of an eye,

01:14:51.930 --> 01:14:53.830
and in that world, muscle jobs go

01:14:53.830 --> 01:14:56.280
where muscle labor is
cheap and that is not here.

01:14:57.820 --> 01:15:00.180
So if you wanna compete,
you're gonna have to exercise

01:15:00.180 --> 01:15:02.880
a different set of muscles,
the one between your ears.

01:15:03.930 --> 01:15:06.500
- So that is "Primary Colors,"

01:15:06.500 --> 01:15:08.360
an anonymous book, it turned out later

01:15:08.360 --> 01:15:12.960
was written by Joe Klein
about the Clinton candidacy.

01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:15.460
And the reason I put that up there

01:15:15.460 --> 01:15:19.800
is because of the
contrast between Clinton,

01:15:19.800 --> 01:15:21.200
and he did actually say that,

01:15:21.200 --> 01:15:24.463
I couldn't find an actual clip
of the New Hampshire Primary,

01:15:25.540 --> 01:15:27.560
so I took it from the movie,

01:15:27.560 --> 01:15:30.190
but it's a radical contradiction

01:15:30.190 --> 01:15:32.660
between his claim in the clip I showed you

01:15:32.660 --> 01:15:37.070
from 1995 saying he wants
to expand home ownership

01:15:37.070 --> 01:15:40.370
to his argument in the
New Hampshire Primary

01:15:40.370 --> 01:15:44.760
three years earlier that
the era of long term

01:15:44.760 --> 01:15:47.110
permanent employment is gone.

01:15:47.110 --> 01:15:52.110
And if you look, this is data
released earlier this year

01:15:52.640 --> 01:15:56.070
by the Bureau of Labor Statistics

01:15:56.070 --> 01:16:00.597
looking at baby boomers
and the takeaway point here

01:16:01.970 --> 01:16:06.970
is that they change jobs 12
times during their lifetimes.

01:16:07.970 --> 01:16:10.940
And only the first five
or so could be explained

01:16:10.940 --> 01:16:15.370
by summer college employment
or something like that.

01:16:15.370 --> 01:16:20.370
So people are looking at long
term employment insecurity,

01:16:20.680 --> 01:16:24.300
and if you're not gonna
know whether and when

01:16:24.300 --> 01:16:27.400
you're gonna be in a position
to service a mortgage,

01:16:27.400 --> 01:16:32.200
then a home without equity is indeed

01:16:32.200 --> 01:16:35.423
nothing more than a rental with debt.

01:16:36.300 --> 01:16:41.300
Okay, so next we will talk
about backlash, 2016 and beyond.

01:16:43.446 --> 01:16:45.863
(slow music)

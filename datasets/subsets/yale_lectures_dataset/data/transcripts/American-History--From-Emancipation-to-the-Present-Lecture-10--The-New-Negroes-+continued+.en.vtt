00:00:09.567 --> 00:00:13.067
When I lectured on Monday
about Marcus Garvey and a

00:00:13.067 --> 00:00:15.000
little bit about
Father Divine,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.600
what I was trying to get
at--towards the end was the

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.600
complicated texture of, for
the lack of a better phrase,

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.000
of-- pardon me.&nbsp; You know,
one should always remember

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.167
to turn one's
cell phone off,

00:00:27.167 --> 00:00:29.500
especially if you're giving
the lecture.&nbsp; One thing I

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:34.400
wanted to get at was the
complicated texture of that

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:39.367
moment as far as the
position and ideology of

00:00:39.367 --> 00:00:41.100
these important
black leaders,

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.500
their competing
philosophies,

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.200
where their
philosophies overlap,

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.967
and then the maybe sometimes
unpredictable ways that

00:00:46.967 --> 00:00:50.867
their followers might
embrace all or parts of--of

00:00:50.867 --> 00:00:56.667
their political, ideological
agenda.&nbsp; There is no single

00:00:56.667 --> 00:01:01.300
leader for this moment that
I'm talking about for today,

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.100
which is, you know,
loosely called the Harlem

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.000
Renaissance.&nbsp; Now I'll--I'll
unpack that later on.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.800
But it's certainly an era
and a moment filled with all

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.400
kinds of conflicting and
competing narratives.&nbsp; And

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.900
one of my goals--really my
main goal today is to sort

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.767
of begin to add texture to
the Harlem Renaissance and

00:01:21.767 --> 00:01:24.400
add some complicating
narratives that I think get

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.367
us closer to the truth as
it was experienced on the

00:01:27.367 --> 00:01:32.000
ground.&nbsp; To help us
in that direction,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.767
I'm going to start with a
poem.&nbsp; It's actually a very

00:01:35.767 --> 00:01:38.600
long poem, I'm only--and I'm
only going to read a short

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.467
part of it.&nbsp; And there's
many different versions of

00:01:41.467 --> 00:01:42.500
the poem.&nbsp; But what
I'll be--the parts I'll be

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.600
reading from are really
sort of the most common

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.800
overlapping stanzas, as it
were.&nbsp; It's a poem by the

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:57.800
writer Cull--Countee
Cullen.&nbsp; Let me just launch

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.500
right into it.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.100
"What is Africa to me:
Copper sun or scarlet sea,

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.367
Jungle star or jungle track,

00:02:10.367 --> 00:02:15.300
Strong bronzed men, or regal
black Women from whose loins

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.400
I sprang, When the
birds of Eden sang?

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.367
One three centuries removed
From the scenes his

00:02:23.367 --> 00:02:27.700
fathers loved, Spicy
grove, cinnamon tree,

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.067
What is Africa to me?"

00:02:30.067 --> 00:02:31.767
This last line here is
often thought of as,

00:02:31.767 --> 00:02:32.767
you know, "what
is Africa to me?"

00:02:32.767 --> 00:02:34.600
the question.&nbsp; It's thought
of as the title of the

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.300
poem.&nbsp; It's not the title of
the poem.&nbsp; The title's much

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.500
more complicated, as we'll
see in a moment.&nbsp; Cullen

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.200
continues in the
poem: "Africa?

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.600
A book one
thumbs, Listlessly,

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.400
till slumber comes."&nbsp;
He then launches into an

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.100
extended exploration of the
naturalism of the African

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.700
scene that defined to him
what Africa was.&nbsp; You know,

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.700
you would have
herds of animals,

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.067
you know, flowing
through the savannah,

00:03:07.067 --> 00:03:09.200
while, you know,
strong, black,

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.500
beautiful couples were
coupling in the--in the

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.500
savannah.&nbsp; They
were in their element,

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.500
a place of animals.&nbsp; Africa,
as you see in Cullen's poem,

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.000
was not a place that he had
any personal knowledge of,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.400
but it's a place
that is, quote,

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:32.200
"a book one thumbs."&nbsp; It's
a place that you discover

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.400
through someone
else's words,

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.967
through someone else's
interpret--interpretation,

00:03:35.967 --> 00:03:38.800
through knowledge that's
passed down.&nbsp; And in this

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.767
way, Africa is a
place of heritage,

00:03:42.767 --> 00:03:43.900
and that's the
actual name of the poem,

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.467
it's called Heritage.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Continuing along in the

00:03:45.467 --> 00:03:50.200
poem, after going through
these sort of naturalistic,

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:55.400
animalistic, exotic
scenes, Cullen continues,

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.100
"Quaint, outlandish heathen
gods Black men fashion out of

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.967
rods, Clay, and
brittle bits of stone,

00:04:02.967 --> 00:04:05.500
In a likeness
like their own,

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.100
My conversion
came high-priced;

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.500
I belong to
Jesus Christ,

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.300
Preacher of
humility;

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.600
Heathen gods are
naught to me.

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.167
Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
So I make an idle boast;

00:04:19.167 --> 00:04:21.100
Jesus of the
twice-turned cheek,

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.167
Lamb of God, although I speak
With my mouth thus,

00:04:24.167 --> 00:04:27.500
in my heart Do I play a double
part. Ever at Thy glowing altar

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.200
Must my heart grow
sick and falter,

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.067
Wishing He I
served were black,

00:04:34.067 --> 00:04:36.700
Thinking then it would not lack
Precedent of pain to guide it,

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:40.100
Let who would or
might deride it;

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:44.567
Surely then this flesh would
know Yours had bone--

00:04:44.567 --> 00:04:47.667
kindred woe. Lord, I
fashion dark gods, too,

00:04:47.667 --> 00:04:51.700
Daring even to give You
Dark despairing features where,

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:54.100
Crowned with dark
rebellious hair,

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:58.567
Patience wavers just so much
as Mortal grief compels,

00:04:58.567 --> 00:05:00.867
while touches
Quick and hot, of anger,

00:05:00.867 --> 00:05:04.600
rise To smitten cheek
and weary eyes.

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:07.700
Lord, forgive me if my need
Sometimes shapes a

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:10.567
human creed. All day long
and all night through,

00:05:10.567 --> 00:05:15.500
One thing only must I do:
Quench my pride and cool

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.900
my blood, Lest I
perish in the flood.

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:22.267
Lest a hidden ember set
Timber that I thought was wet

00:05:22.267 --> 00:05:25.200
Burning like the driest flax,
Melting like the merest wax,

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.300
Lest the grave restore its dead.
Not yet has my heart or head

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:35.267
In the least way realized
They and I are civilized."

00:05:35.267 --> 00:05:38.600
And now I know I gave you
like four or five stanzas

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:41.900
really quickly here.&nbsp;
There's--A few things that I

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:47.300
hope that you are hearing
in this reading.&nbsp; Cullen

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:49.000
wrestling with the
cost of conversion,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.500
religious conversion, a
complicated recognition of

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:58.867
civilization, and the very
conscious evocation of race

00:05:58.867 --> 00:06:05.200
pride.&nbsp; Cullen writes, "My
conversion came high-priced;

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:10.300
I belong to Jesus Christ."&nbsp;
It's his own recognition,

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.500
I think, that even when
though--even though he's

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:15.500
trained in the technique of
high European arts--this is

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.600
a very formalized
poem after all,

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:23.567
formalistic--the
"blessing," in quotes,

00:06:23.567 --> 00:06:26.600
of training in civilization
came at a high price.

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:27.900
I mean, through
this poem the,

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:32.067
the--you see the, the, the
narrator talking about this

00:06:32.067 --> 00:06:35.400
Africa he doesn't know,
landing in this naturalized,

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:40.000
exotic setting, and then
wrestling with what he sees

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
as religion, thinking,
"Oh, well this is really

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.167
backwards," and
thinking, "Well,

00:06:43.167 --> 00:06:45.300
maybe it's actually
something different.&nbsp; Maybe

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:47.800
I can't actually see it
because of the way I've been

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:51.367
trained."&nbsp; And that
"it" he's talking about is

00:06:51.367 --> 00:06:56.600
civilization.&nbsp; Cullen
acknowledged--or the

00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:01.800
narrator acknowledges,
as the poem goes forward,

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:07.900
that Africans were
civilized.&nbsp; Throughout the

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:09.400
poem--I mean, by
the end of the poem,

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:11.400
you realize that throughout
the poem he's wrestling with

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:13.067
the question,
"Well, you know,

00:07:13.067 --> 00:07:16.667
I know I'm civilized.&nbsp; I've
been converted.&nbsp; I belong to

00:07:16.667 --> 00:07:19.200
Jesus Christ."&nbsp;
But, you know,

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:20.700
these--these
dark--these, these,

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:22.767
these
rods--these, these gods,

00:07:22.767 --> 00:07:26.300
excuse me, they're
fashioning out of "dark and

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:29.000
brittle rods," maybe there's
something to that as well.&nbsp;

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.200
And what he's
really bemoaning,

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:37.567
I think, is the fact
that it took him so long to

00:07:37.567 --> 00:07:41.100
understand that these
Africanist belief systems,

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:42.900
this fashioning of many
different kinds of dark

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:47.000
gods, that he actually saw
something desirable in it as

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
well; that he
often wished his god,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.200
something you can't see and
can't hear in the reading of

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:53.200
it, but you see
in the print,

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:55.167
with, you know, he's
capitalizing "He" and "You"

00:07:55.167 --> 00:07:59.367
often, that he wishes his
god were a god that looked

00:07:59.367 --> 00:08:05.200
black, or looked, you know,
black African.&nbsp; And so it's

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:08.400
the pain of discovery that
he has lost something in the

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:12.167
process of gaining
something.&nbsp; He wished that,

00:08:12.167 --> 00:08:16.300
quote, "He I served were
black" and that if there

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:20.600
were a black god, if
one could imagine it,

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:23.967
one could extend a belief
system such that there'd be

00:08:23.967 --> 00:08:27.067
recognized--a recognition in
the United States that black

00:08:27.067 --> 00:08:30.600
Americans might have
some purchase--a different

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:33.800
interpretation, certainly,
but a purchase--on one of

00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:36.200
those most treasured
things of being civilized,

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:39.500
a formalized
religious belief system,

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:42.367
that a white god could be
a black god and still be a

00:08:42.367 --> 00:08:48.367
god.&nbsp; It's a
powerfully complex poem,

00:08:51.367 --> 00:08:54.100
speaks to all these
different issues: verbalized

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:56.300
pride in the natural
beauty and bounty of Africa,

00:08:56.300 --> 00:09:01.800
at the same time speaking
ashamedly of its simplicity;

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:05.900
illuminating as it does that
heritage is something of

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:09.700
which one can be proud, but
also something about which

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:14.400
one can feel exquisite
pain.&nbsp; And the speaker

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:15.667
clearly feels, by
the end of the poem,

00:09:15.667 --> 00:09:17.800
remorse about being torn
in these two different

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:18.800
directions.

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:21.467
Toward the end of the
poem, he asks forgiveness,

00:09:21.467 --> 00:09:23.900
after all, for the actions
he takes that he feels are

00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:26.967
necessitated by the strange
cruelties and ironies of

00:09:26.967 --> 00:09:31.500
heritage.&nbsp; He says,
"Lord, forgive me if my need

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:36.300
sometimes shapes a human
creed."&nbsp; This last phrase,

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:38.200
"Lord, forgive me if my need
sometimes shapes a human

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:43.600
creed," really is a metaphor
that I want to use.&nbsp; I want

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:47.000
to use it as a metaphor,
deploy it if you will,

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.967
to help us get a purchase on
the New Negro Renaissance.&nbsp;

00:09:49.967 --> 00:09:52.700
And one quick caveat
here--and I've already--in

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:55.200
fact, I've already done
it--I'll talk about the

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:57.000
Harlem Renaissance and
the New Negro--New Negro

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.367
Renaissance.&nbsp; Just
for your understanding,

00:09:59.367 --> 00:10:02.467
I'm talking about the
exact same thing.&nbsp; This is

00:10:02.467 --> 00:10:06.200
actually old habit.&nbsp; For
the longest time when I was

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:09.300
being trained and educated,
if--and we talked about the

00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:13.300
era, it's always about the
Harlem Renaissance.&nbsp; In the

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:15.167
last twenty
years or so, that,

00:10:15.167 --> 00:10:17.800
well probably a
little more than that,

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:22.167
but the--the use of Harlem
Renaissance has faded in

00:10:22.167 --> 00:10:24.300
many quarters, with the
reference to New--to the New

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:28.100
Negro Renaissance as well.&nbsp;
And I--I should be detailing

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:30.300
some of that in today's
lecture.&nbsp; But for me,

00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:32.367
this is
just--it's old habit,

00:10:32.367 --> 00:10:35.267
but with a recognition
of a much more common,

00:10:35.267 --> 00:10:36.900
and I think accurate,
depiction of how you'd

00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:39.600
understand this era,
and that is the--as,

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:43.600
excuse me, the New Negro
Renaissance.&nbsp; Whatever I'm

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:45.867
going to call it
in this lecture,

00:10:45.867 --> 00:10:48.467
I want you to think of
the Renaissance as a moment

00:10:48.467 --> 00:10:51.800
where issues of
culture, where politics,

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:55.100
where economics,
where social psychology,

00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:58.000
and perhaps even social
pathology--not even perhaps,

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.100
certainly social pathology,
come crashing together.&nbsp;

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:05.600
Collectively,
these things, culture,

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:09.000
politics, economics, social
psychology and pathology,

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.967
collectively forging a human
creed out of a human need.

00:11:12.967 --> 00:11:18.300
&nbsp;In the time that remains,
I'm going to canvass the

00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:21.900
Renaissance, hitting some
of the famous high spots,

00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:25.000
calling your attention to
some lesser known moments,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.900
and suggesting some
alternative ways to think

00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:30.967
about what the
Renaissance actually is.

00:11:30.967 --> 00:11:35.000
Let's go back to Countee
Cullen's "Heritage."&nbsp; This

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.567
is seen as one of the
hallmark poems of the

00:11:37.567 --> 00:11:40.167
Renaissance.&nbsp; If you come
across some selections of

00:11:40.167 --> 00:11:41.700
Cullen's poetry
and anthologies,

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:45.667
you'll be sure to see this
poem cited.&nbsp; But there's

00:11:45.667 --> 00:11:48.400
another poem called,
also called "Heritage" that

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:51.600
preceded Cullen's.&nbsp; It was
written by an artist named

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:56.767
Gwendolyn Bennett.&nbsp;
Renaissance historians don't

00:11:56.767 --> 00:11:59.400
really have much to
say about Bennett.

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:01.367
Much of her
work, her paintings,

00:12:01.367 --> 00:12:04.567
her sculpture, her writings,
much of the work was

00:12:04.567 --> 00:12:07.367
destroyed by an angry
father and stepmother,

00:12:07.367 --> 00:12:09.700
who wanted her to do
something "useful" with her

00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:13.567
life.&nbsp; But it's worth
pausing for a moment to

00:12:13.567 --> 00:12:15.100
reflect on her work, and to
think about the fact that

00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:18.467
what we--and, and to think
about the fact that what we

00:12:18.467 --> 00:12:23.267
see here, read,
about the Renaissance,

00:12:23.267 --> 00:12:27.367
has far too little to do
with the women artists

00:12:27.367 --> 00:12:29.167
during the period.&nbsp; There
were a lot of them doing

00:12:29.167 --> 00:12:32.167
important work.

00:12:32.167 --> 00:12:35.000
Anyway, "Heritage" by
Gwendolyn Bennett.&nbsp; It's a

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.300
much shorter poem
but, well you'll see,

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:42.067
you'll see why I read it.

00:12:42.067 --> 00:12:45.000
"I want to see the
slim palm-trees,

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.300
Pulling at the clouds, With
little pointed fingers...

00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:52.300
I want to see lithe Negro
girls, Etched dark against

00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:56.700
the sky, While sunset lingers.

00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:59.200
I want to hear
the silent sands,

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:03.900
Singing to the moon, Before
the Sphinx-still face...

00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:06.100
I want to hear the chanting
Around a heathen fire

00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:09.167
Of a strange black race.

00:13:09.167 --> 00:13:12.400
I want to breathe
the Lotus flow'r,

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:15.500
Sighing to the stars
With tendrils drinking

00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:16.867
at the Nile...

00:13:16.867 --> 00:13:19.367
I want to feel the surging
Of my sad people's soul,

00:13:19.367 --> 00:13:24.467
Hidden by a minstrel-smile."

00:13:24.467 --> 00:13:26.867
Like Cullen--and this is--I
mean Cullen's poem is quite

00:13:26.867 --> 00:13:29.600
famous; this one is sort
of an afterthought.&nbsp; Like

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:32.800
Cullen, Bennett has a highly
romanticized notion of what

00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:36.567
one would find in
Africa.&nbsp; Also like Cullen,

00:13:36.567 --> 00:13:40.600
Bennett has an angry coda in
her poem that recognizes the

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:45.167
painful side of heritage
as well.&nbsp; Africa has exotic

00:13:45.167 --> 00:13:48.167
strength,
natural beauty, grace,

00:13:48.167 --> 00:13:50.967
but it's also been seen as
the birthplace of a people

00:13:50.967 --> 00:13:53.800
who have to hide their pain
behind a "minstrel-smile."&nbsp;

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.100
So if taking these
two poems together,

00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:01.400
black America's heritage
presents such a quandary.&nbsp;

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:06.500
What are we to make of
the New Negro Renaissance?&nbsp;

00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:08.700
There are at least two
critical things to know

00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:12.167
about the Renaissance, at
least for the purposes of

00:14:12.167 --> 00:14:14.900
this class and the
examinations.&nbsp; It needs to

00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:18.600
be thought of as a movement,
and it needs to be thought

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:20.800
of as a movement of
binaries.&nbsp; And I'll be

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:26.800
getting to that in a
moment.&nbsp; I'll be getting

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:34.100
to--I mean, you might want
to take the notes down.&nbsp;

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:35.967
I'll be talking a bit about
the binaries in a moment,

00:14:35.967 --> 00:14:38.500
but these are the binaries
that I--that I think are

00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:44.500
worth thinking about.&nbsp; Now
what makes it a movement?&nbsp;

00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:48.467
As I said at the
beginning of the lecture,

00:14:48.467 --> 00:14:50.467
it has no singular
leader like Garvey,

00:14:50.467 --> 00:14:53.700
or Du Bois, or
Father Divine,

00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:54.700
or Booker T.

00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:56.000
Washington.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.600
But I think we could
consider it a movement,

00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:00.200
because to
understand the Renaissance,

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:02.200
one has to understand a
broad range of things that,

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:05.900
taken together, have
coherence.&nbsp; It's a movement

00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:09.900
involve--that involves
the written word.&nbsp; It's a

00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:13.167
movement that involves the
theater.&nbsp; It's a movement

00:15:13.167 --> 00:15:18.300
that involves music.&nbsp; It's a
movement that involves the

00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:21.767
material arts, sculpture and
painting.&nbsp; It's a movement

00:15:21.767 --> 00:15:25.600
that involves film.&nbsp; It's a
movement that involves club

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:29.367
life, as you see detailed in
this--this very intense book

00:15:29.367 --> 00:15:32.600
I've asked you to read
this week.&nbsp; And it's also a

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:36.700
movement of white
infatuation.&nbsp; Now as I said,

00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:39.667
and I'll start--I'll start
detailing these in a moment,

00:15:39.667 --> 00:15:42.067
it's also a
movement of binaries,

00:15:42.067 --> 00:15:43.900
they're on the screen
there.&nbsp; It's American and

00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:47.800
it's African.&nbsp; It's urban
and it's rural.&nbsp; It embraces

00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:51.867
high culture and low, or
folk culture.&nbsp; It's about

00:15:51.867 --> 00:15:57.500
racial independence and
about patronage.&nbsp; So the

00:15:57.500 --> 00:16:00.667
Renaissance is this moment
of astonishing cultural

00:16:00.667 --> 00:16:03.500
production going in
many different directions,

00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:05.500
expressed in many
different ways,

00:16:08.567 --> 00:16:14.200
but it grows out of certain
real demographic changes,

00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:18.567
political changes, social,
psychological changes as

00:16:18.567 --> 00:16:25.500
well.&nbsp; Very simply, the
migration grows out of--I

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:27.200
mean, excuse me, the
Renaissance grows out of the

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:29.467
Great Migration.

00:16:29.467 --> 00:16:31.200
You can't have the
Renaissance really without

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:33.300
the migration.

00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:36.067
Now remember, the migration
was not literally from a

00:16:36.067 --> 00:16:39.467
field in Alabama to New
York City--New York City's

00:16:39.467 --> 00:16:42.067
Harlem, although some
certainly did make that

00:16:42.067 --> 00:16:45.700
journey in that way.&nbsp; The
migration was moving in fits

00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:47.800
and starts,
forward and back,

00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:50.800
backward and forwards,
North to South again,

00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:54.000
a little further north,
maybe to Midwest to North.&nbsp;

00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:00.600
It's a movement of, sort of
a general level of chaos but

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:02.767
tending and trending
towards the North and urban

00:17:02.767 --> 00:17:07.800
centers.&nbsp; That soup of
the migration is rather

00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:11.100
important because if you are
from the fields in Alabama

00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:13.800
and find yourself six months
later--say you've been

00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:17.700
picking cotton in Alabama
and now you're working in a,

00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:21.567
in a coal field--a coal mine
in West Virginia and you're

00:17:21.567 --> 00:17:25.467
there for another year, it's
not just about your labor,

00:17:25.467 --> 00:17:27.467
but it's about a kind
of cultural exchange,

00:17:27.467 --> 00:17:28.800
your ways of
looking at the world,

00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:30.467
the kind of foods you eat
and the way you prepare

00:17:30.467 --> 00:17:34.200
them, the songs that are
important to you.&nbsp; There is,

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:37.867
with this migration, a
profound cultural sharing of

00:17:37.867 --> 00:17:41.600
experiences, just by
happenstance.&nbsp; When you move

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:45.000
people, their ideas and
their values move with them,

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.100
and they clash or they
mix, depending on the

00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:51.467
circumstance, in generative
ways.&nbsp; So the Renaissance

00:17:51.467 --> 00:17:53.900
develops out of the fact
that the culture is moving

00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:57.000
with the people to different
places.&nbsp; And when you have

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.000
such an intense change
in places like Chicago,

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.800
or Detroit, or New York City
in terms of demographics,

00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:06.000
there's a
heightened sense of,

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000
of, of cultural tension,
and that's what's really so

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.700
important about the
Renaissance's connection to

00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:15.500
the migration, and why
Harlem is often thought of

00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:17.667
as the, as the, as
the--referred to as the

00:18:17.667 --> 00:18:21.500
Harlem Renaissance, because
Harlem does become the focal

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:23.400
point for so much of
these artistic changes,

00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:27.400
although they are happening
everywhere.&nbsp; The Renaissance

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:29.200
develops out of
World War I injustices,

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:35.167
and soldiers returning home,
and the heightened racial

00:18:35.167 --> 00:18:38.400
awareness that grows out
of it.&nbsp; I ended last week's

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:40.100
lecture with
Countee Cullen's,

00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:42.500
you know, "If We Must
Die," often seen as,

00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:45.767
sort of, one of
the, the, the,

00:18:45.767 --> 00:18:49.400
the call to arms in a sense,
for the Harlem Renaissance

00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:55.800
poets, in retrospect.&nbsp; The
Renaissance develops out of

00:18:55.800 --> 00:19:01.900
an intense black political
impatience.&nbsp; I'll explain

00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:04.700
more about that in a
moment.&nbsp; It's--It would be

00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:06.700
nowhere, the Renaissance,
without patronage,

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.967
and it wouldn't--and it
wouldn't be nearly what it

00:19:10.967 --> 00:19:14.800
was if you didn't have
technological developments,

00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:16.400
in terms of the
publication--publishing

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:18.500
industry and
entertainment industry,

00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:21.600
literally, how you
produce records,

00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:24.367
mass marketing.&nbsp; The
Renaissance wouldn't have

00:19:24.367 --> 00:19:26.400
spread as broadly as it
did without these changes as

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:28.400
well.&nbsp; So there's some
technical aspects to it.&nbsp;

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:34.300
Now let me try to narrow
things down a little bit on

00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:35.600
the Renaissance
itself.&nbsp; You know,

00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:37.067
it involves these
different things,

00:19:37.067 --> 00:19:40.000
these different kinds of
artistic expressions.&nbsp; It

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.400
involves the
different forces,

00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:44.467
you know sort of combined in
a such a way to make such an

00:19:44.467 --> 00:19:46.567
important
moment, but, you know,

00:19:46.567 --> 00:19:51.500
what are its boundaries?&nbsp;
The Renaissance--I mean the

00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:53.900
short answer is, we don't
really know.&nbsp; We kind of

00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:57.900
generally agree, we being
people who agree with me.&nbsp;

00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:02.900
The--But most historians
really point to the

00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:06.600
Renaissance starting in
1919.&nbsp; There are certainly

00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:08.200
moments here and
there where you,

00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:10.600
you know, have artists
coming together doing some

00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:13.700
bold and interesting things
prior to that.&nbsp; There's no

00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:16.300
doubt about it.&nbsp;
But in terms of a

00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:19.800
self-consciousness, a
collective self-conscious,

00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:22.600
a will to change, it's when
the black soldiers return

00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:26.200
home.&nbsp; It's when the cities
go up in flames and black

00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:29.400
communities are targeted,
and it's given to Countee

00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:31.700
Cullen publishing
this really spectacular

00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:33.667
poem--excuse
me, Claude McKay,

00:20:33.667 --> 00:20:37.800
publishing "If We Must
Die."&nbsp; And if I said

00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:40.800
earlier--mental rewind--if I
said Countee Cullen with "If

00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:42.067
We Must Die," it
is Claude McKay,

00:20:42.067 --> 00:20:47.567
just to make sure I
didn't misspeak.&nbsp; Now that

00:20:47.567 --> 00:20:48.567
beginning, so
we'll, you know,

00:20:48.567 --> 00:20:50.700
we'll stick with 1919 for
this course.&nbsp; This is a

00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:53.167
pretty accepted start point
for the Harlem Renaissance,

00:20:53.167 --> 00:20:55.767
New Negro Renaissance.&nbsp;
Its endpoint is really much

00:20:55.767 --> 00:20:59.500
murkier.&nbsp; Many will point
to the stock market crash in

00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:02.767
1929, and there's
compelling reasons,

00:21:02.767 --> 00:21:05.600
because once
disposable income dries up,

00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:08.100
it's much harder to
patronize a club or support

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:11.867
an artist.&nbsp; So if the
Renaissance continues after

00:21:11.867 --> 00:21:15.400
1929, it's certainly
diminished.&nbsp; But if you stop

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:19.167
it at 1929, you would
actually cut out from the

00:21:19.167 --> 00:21:21.567
Harlem Renaissance
conversation a lot of its

00:21:21.567 --> 00:21:24.500
most famous artists and
writers whose work really

00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:28.967
comes to be known in the
1930s.&nbsp; So 1929 is a bit

00:21:28.967 --> 00:21:31.800
harsh of a cut off.&nbsp; We
can move it into the 1930s

00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:34.800
easily, with the growth of
the federal government and

00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:37.800
the New Deal and the--and
the support the New Deal

00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:43.800
gives to artists of all
colors and backgrounds.&nbsp; And

00:21:46.767 --> 00:21:48.867
you might even carry it
up to 1941 when the U.S.

00:21:48.867 --> 00:21:52.667
enters the Second World
War.&nbsp; This might even be

00:21:52.667 --> 00:21:56.600
stretching it a little bit.&nbsp;
A few people even say the

00:21:56.600 --> 00:22:00.267
Renaissance never ended; it
just kind of quieted down.&nbsp;

00:22:00.267 --> 00:22:02.967
I think for our purposes,
to have it--a useful

00:22:02.967 --> 00:22:04.700
understanding of
the Renaissance,

00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:06.800
we really need to think
of it as an inter-war

00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:14.000
phenomenon, 1919 to
certainly the early 1930s,

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.900
with less clarity maybe to
1941.&nbsp; The endpoint is less

00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:24.200
important to me.&nbsp; Now within
this vague realm of the

00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:26.000
timeline, there is an
important marker that

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:33.600
there's no debating: 1925 is
universally recognized as a

00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:36.500
pivotal moment in the
history of the Renaissance.&nbsp;

00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:38.400
Maybe it began with
Claude McKay's poem,

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:41.700
but a pivotal moment is
the 1925 publication of a

00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:44.800
journal, a special issue
of a journal called Survey

00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:49.900
Graphic.&nbsp; It was
edited, this special issue,

00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:51.867
edited by this
man, Alain Locke,

00:22:51.867 --> 00:22:58.300
a professor of philosophy at
Howard University.&nbsp; People

00:22:58.300 --> 00:23:01.400
recognized--Locke was one of
these people--that there was

00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:05.100
something happening in terms
of cultural production.&nbsp;

00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:06.700
There were a
lot of, you know,

00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:09.100
art shows, a lot
of new music forms,

00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:13.900
a rise in popularity and
certainly consumption.&nbsp; He

00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:14.967
goes, you know,
"I want to tap,

00:23:14.967 --> 00:23:16.900
I want to gather
up this moment,

00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:20.467
as we can do it in a
journal" and so he gathers a

00:23:20.467 --> 00:23:22.567
collection of poems,
excerpts from plays,

00:23:22.567 --> 00:23:25.767
essays, and short stories,
that represented in Locke's

00:23:25.767 --> 00:23:30.367
mind the new spirit in
black America.&nbsp; The special

00:23:30.367 --> 00:23:35.000
edition of Survey Graphic
is published as a book.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:36.567
It's expanded and
published as a book,

00:23:36.567 --> 00:23:40.000
edited by Locke, that is
recognized as the bible of

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.967
the Renaissance, and
that book is called The New

00:23:41.967 --> 00:23:43.400
Negro.

00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:47.400
&nbsp; Now you remember the, the
phrase New Negro goes back

00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:48.400
to Booker T.

00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:49.967
Washington's, you know,
popularizing of it at the

00:23:49.967 --> 00:23:50.967
turn of the century.

00:23:50.967 --> 00:23:56.000
It becomes more commonplace
with this changing

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.800
mentality.&nbsp;
Soldiers come home,

00:23:57.800 --> 00:24:01.400
World War I, and really
starts to go through the

00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:04.800
culture with Alain Locke's
publication of the New Negro

00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:07.867
in 1926.&nbsp; The journal
becomes--a special issue of

00:24:07.867 --> 00:24:11.267
the journal becomes an
expanded book.&nbsp; I mentioned

00:24:11.267 --> 00:24:12.800
earlier that one of the
things you need to think

00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:16.167
about the--the Renaissance
is thinking of it as a

00:24:16.167 --> 00:24:20.100
movement, a movement
engaging politics.&nbsp; Locke,

00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:24.100
a philosopher, was
convinced that culture,

00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:26.600
that thing he's trying to
gather up in the book New

00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:29.900
Negro¸ culture was a
political battleground.&nbsp; He

00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:33.500
was explicit on these
terms--this issue.&nbsp; The

00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:38.000
Renaissance in Locke's
term, in Locke's opinion,

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.967
was all about a fight for
cultural recognition.&nbsp; And

00:24:41.967 --> 00:24:44.900
then once that
recognition was gained,

00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:50.200
it was about political
freedom and equality.&nbsp; That

00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:53.567
once black Americans could
demonstrate that they have

00:24:53.567 --> 00:24:55.867
something to--something to
contribute to the world from

00:24:55.867 --> 00:24:59.200
a cultural standpoint,
others would have no choice

00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:04.700
but to recognize that
they had something of value,

00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:07.800
and they would be embraced
and given their political

00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:13.867
freedom of full equal
rights.&nbsp; You can hear this

00:25:13.867 --> 00:25:17.500
in the opening and
closing quotes from Locke's

00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:19.567
introduction to the
book, The New Negro.

00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:23.867
On the New Negro
mentality, Locke says,

00:25:23.867 --> 00:25:26.567
"For the younger generation
is vibrant with a new

00:25:26.567 --> 00:25:29.800
psychology; the new spirit
is awake in the masses,

00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:32.267
and under the very eyes of
the professional observers

00:25:32.267 --> 00:25:35.200
is transforming what has
been a perennial problem

00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:39.700
into the progressive phases
of contemporary Negro life."

00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:42.900
On the value of culture
to political possibility,

00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:46.600
Locke says the following:
"It must be increasingly

00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:49.400
recognized that the
Negro has already made very

00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:52.300
substantial contributions,
not only in his folk-art

00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:53.367
music especially--not
only in his folk-art,

00:25:53.367 --> 00:25:59.300
music especially, which has
always found appreciation,

00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:01.067
but in larger,
though humbler and less

00:26:01.067 --> 00:26:02.167
acknowledged ways.

00:26:02.167 --> 00:26:03.167
...

00:26:03.167 --> 00:26:05.900
A second crop of the Negro's
gifts promises still more

00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:06.967
largely.

00:26:06.967 --> 00:26:09.600
He now becomes a conscious
contributor and lays aside

00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:13.200
the status of beneficiary
and ward for that of a

00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:16.800
collaborator and participant
in American civilization.

00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:18.400
...

00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:21.300
The especially cultural
recognition they win should

00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:24.000
in turn prove the key to
that revaluation of the

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:27.100
Negro which must precede or
accompany any considerable

00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:29.700
further betterment of
race relationships."

00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:34.600
Culture is the key for
Locke.&nbsp; So Locke really,

00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:37.700
I mean literally saw the
Renaissance as a political

00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:43.700
movement, shrouded in the
cloth of culture.&nbsp; Locke

00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:48.200
talks as some length about
the folk culture that so

00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:49.900
often defined, for
good or for bad,

00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:51.300
black life in America.

00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:53.800
And to be sure, this is part
of the heritage that many

00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:57.200
Renaissance artists hailed
in their work.&nbsp; But the

00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:59.800
celebration of
folk art styles,

00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:03.900
rhythms, and voices becomes
very complicated when we

00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:08.967
consider white infatuation,
or where scholars will often

00:27:08.967 --> 00:27:11.767
use the phrase, the "white
gaze."&nbsp; "The white gaze."&nbsp;

00:27:11.767 --> 00:27:15.967
What do we mean by the
white gaze?&nbsp; Talking about,

00:27:15.967 --> 00:27:18.167
literally in some ways, the
people who come to Harlem

00:27:18.167 --> 00:27:21.300
clubs to witness
and experience the,

00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:26.100
quote, "delirious" social
scene in Harlem.&nbsp; White

00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:28.000
patrons coming to clubs,
clubs where blacks are

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.600
performing in Harlem, that
blacks could not go into as

00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:37.967
patrons themselves.&nbsp; Now
that's a literal.&nbsp; He's

00:27:37.967 --> 00:27:40.500
talking about white bodies
buying tickets to see black

00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:43.800
performances.&nbsp;
But less literally,

00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:46.600
the gaze I'm talking about
described white patrons'

00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:49.600
fascination, not just with
black cultural performance,

00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:56.100
but cultural ability.&nbsp; You
have prominent patrons like

00:27:56.100 --> 00:27:59.267
Albert Barnes, the
famous art collector,

00:27:59.267 --> 00:28:01.300
a white man who
praised blacks',

00:28:01.300 --> 00:28:04.067
quote, "authentic and native
talent."&nbsp; And these are very

00:28:04.067 --> 00:28:06.300
loaded words.&nbsp; You
know, what is authentic,

00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:07.300
after all?

00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:09.000
What do you mean
when you say native?

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.000
&nbsp;What kind of baggage is
being carried with that?&nbsp;

00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:15.200
Now Barnes was recognized as
a great patron of the arts

00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:17.500
and as a great, as the
phrase was of the time,

00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:20.867
"a friend of the
race."&nbsp; No one doubted,

00:28:20.867 --> 00:28:24.567
you know, his credentials
in that regard.&nbsp; And Locke,

00:28:24.567 --> 00:28:26.767
Locke recognized this and
wanted to have Barnes in his

00:28:26.767 --> 00:28:28.600
collection.&nbsp; He's
an important figure,

00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:31.300
playing an important role in
the cultural development or

00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:34.200
the propagation of African
American cultural skills.&nbsp;

00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:39.367
So Barnes has the second
essay in The New Negro.&nbsp; And

00:28:39.367 --> 00:28:43.667
he says the following: "That
there should have developed

00:28:43.667 --> 00:28:46.800
a distinctively Negro art
in America was natural and

00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:48.200
inevitable.

00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:50.300
A primitive race,
transported into an

00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:53.200
Anglo-Saxon environment and
held in subjection to that

00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:56.667
fundamentally--fundamentally
alien influence,

00:28:56.667 --> 00:28:59.500
was bound to undergo the
soul stirring experiences

00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:01.567
which always find their
expression in great art.

00:29:01.567 --> 00:29:02.567
...

00:29:02.567 --> 00:29:04.300
The most important element
to be considered is the

00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:07.400
psychological complexion of
the Negro as he inherited it

00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:10.400
from his primitive ancestors
and which he maintains to

00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:11.800
this day.

00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:13.967
The outstanding
characteristics are his

00:29:13.967 --> 00:29:15.867
tremendous
emotional endowment,

00:29:15.867 --> 00:29:18.867
his luxuriant and free
imagination and a truly

00:29:18.867 --> 00:29:21.267
great power of
individual expression.

00:29:21.267 --> 00:29:24.600
He has in superlative
measure that fire and light

00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:27.500
which, coming from within,
bathes his whole world,

00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:31.200
colors his images and
impels him to expression.

00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:32.900
The Negro is a
poet by birth.

00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:33.967
...

00:29:33.967 --> 00:29:36.500
The white man in the mass
cannot compete with the

00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:38.600
Negro in
spiritual endowment.

00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:41.067
Many centuries of
civilization have attenuated

00:29:41.067 --> 00:29:44.300
his original gifts and have
made his mind dominate his

00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:46.167
spirit."

00:29:46.167 --> 00:29:48.400
Now I know I've talked about
civilization and civilizing

00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:53.300
ideologies some--you know, a
lot to date in this course.&nbsp;

00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:54.667
But one reason I
share this quote,

00:29:54.667 --> 00:30:00.900
because it is--it is the,
the currency that a lot of

00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:04.700
these--these black leaders
and white leaders share in

00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:06.800
terms of really
who is to be saved,

00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:10.200
who is to be fought for,
who has certain gifts.&nbsp; And

00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:12.867
Barnes, as dated as this
language sounds today,

00:30:12.867 --> 00:30:16.100
and even condescending, he
was being quite clear in his

00:30:16.100 --> 00:30:20.200
admiration of blacks'
cultural gifts.&nbsp; Now he also

00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:22.400
thought that that's because
they were really not quite

00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:24.067
fully civilized, but they
were in touch with something

00:30:24.067 --> 00:30:30.667
more primal than whites.&nbsp;
Whites no longer--they used

00:30:30.667 --> 00:30:37.100
to have it.&nbsp; They could no
longer be in touch with this

00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:44.400
part of their spirit because
their minds had become

00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:48.400
overdeveloped.&nbsp; Now
fascination with--pardon me

00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:54.100
one second here.&nbsp; The--the
fascination from the

00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:57.100
patrons' standpoint would be
complicated in the sense of

00:30:57.100 --> 00:30:59.400
Albert Barnes, an incredibly
important art collector,

00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:03.000
supporter of the arts and
black artistic production,

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.267
but with these sort of
interesting world views.&nbsp;

00:31:05.267 --> 00:31:13.167
You have other patrons
like Charlotte Mason who,

00:31:13.167 --> 00:31:17.600
rather wealthy and supported
the artists in a different

00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:18.600
way than Barnes.

00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:21.100
Barnes would buy their
art; Charlotte Mason,

00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:25.200
you know, had
artists on retainer,

00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:26.767
most famously Zora
Neale Hurston and,

00:31:26.767 --> 00:31:30.000
at one point, Langston
Hughes as well.&nbsp; And Zora

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.300
Neale Hurston, whose most
famous work comes out a

00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:36.967
little bit later in the
1930s--this is sort of the

00:31:36.967 --> 00:31:39.500
issue of stretching
the Renaissance a bit.&nbsp;

00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:40.967
Essentially,
Charlotte Mason would,

00:31:40.967 --> 00:31:44.467
you know, give Zora Neale
Hurston a place--have Zora

00:31:44.467 --> 00:31:46.000
Neale Hurston stay
in her apartment,

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:47.300
and then would give her
assignments.&nbsp; Zora Neale

00:31:47.300 --> 00:31:50.167
Hurston, training as
an anthropologist,

00:31:50.167 --> 00:31:53.800
and Mason would send her
down South to go and explore

00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:59.200
an area, and then come back
and "tell me stories" about

00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:01.800
this native
folk in, you know,

00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:06.167
the backwaters of Georgia.&nbsp;
Now--and Hurston would do

00:32:06.167 --> 00:32:07.867
this.&nbsp; I mean she didn't
have any other resources,

00:32:07.867 --> 00:32:11.167
but there were times when
she would push back against

00:32:11.167 --> 00:32:13.400
the patron who insisted on
being called "Godmother."&nbsp;

00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:15.900
She pushed back
saying, you know,

00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:17.800
"I don't want to do this.&nbsp; I
want to do something else."&nbsp;

00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:19.967
And Mason said, "Well, I
want you to do what I asked

00:32:19.967 --> 00:32:23.200
you to do."&nbsp; So this
patronage thing becomes very

00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:26.700
complicated, especially when
you consider that Mason also

00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:28.567
was asking Hurston to be
her housekeeper at the same

00:32:28.567 --> 00:32:33.700
time.&nbsp; Langston Hughes was
under Mason's umbrella until

00:32:33.700 --> 00:32:35.600
he got in a
fight--Langston Hughes,

00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:38.200
incredibly--sort of
the poet laureate of the

00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:43.500
Renaissance--got in a huge
fight with Mason and with

00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:47.000
Hurston and was sort of
cut off essentially.&nbsp; So

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.500
patronage was complicated
in terms that are quite

00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:51.500
literal, in terms of "I'm no
longer going to put food on

00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:53.300
the table for you," or "I'm
going to kick you out of my

00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:57.367
apartment."&nbsp; Patronage could
be complicated in other ways

00:32:57.367 --> 00:33:02.200
also, and this is actually a
local story.&nbsp; It turns out

00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:05.400
that if you want to study
the Harlem Renaissance,

00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:08.400
the best place in the world
to do so is a few blocks

00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:11.100
away at the Beinecke.&nbsp; It
has the largest collection

00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:12.800
of African
American literature,

00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:16.800
arts, sculpture, and
paintings for this period.&nbsp;

00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:18.767
The other great repository
is down in New York City,

00:33:18.767 --> 00:33:20.200
the Schomburg
Research Center,

00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:23.300
but for the Renaissance, you
need to come to Yale.&nbsp; Carl

00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:27.067
Van Vechten,
white writer, artist,

00:33:27.067 --> 00:33:30.700
photographer, and a great
supporter of the arts in New

00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:32.867
York City in sort
of salon culture,

00:33:32.867 --> 00:33:36.900
really connected a lot of
black artists and white

00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:41.000
artists together, and a lot
of black artists and white

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:42.000
patrons together.

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.400
&nbsp;And he
convinced his friends,

00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:46.567
his black artist
friends, you know,

00:33:46.567 --> 00:33:48.500
"Why don't you give your
papers or your collections

00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:52.900
to Yale when it's time?"&nbsp;
And then he convinced a lot

00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:55.500
of his white artist friends
to give their stuff to Fisk

00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:57.900
University,
historically black college,

00:33:57.900 --> 00:34:00.100
when it was their time.&nbsp;
The thinking was that black

00:34:00.100 --> 00:34:03.300
scholars would study black
artists and vice versa,

00:34:03.300 --> 00:34:05.700
and they would have to go to
these other institutions and

00:34:05.700 --> 00:34:08.067
sort of cross-pollinate
in some sort of way.

00:34:08.067 --> 00:34:10.800
I mean--and there's actually
a lot of truth in what Van

00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:12.500
Vechten set up
as a, as a model.

00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:19.400
It's also rather funny the
way that--that libraries,

00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:20.767
you know, have
this--this coding.

00:34:20.767 --> 00:34:22.767
You all know that, you
know, you'll find U.S.

00:34:22.767 --> 00:34:25.700
History in E185
point whatever.&nbsp; Well,

00:34:25.700 --> 00:34:27.900
in the Beinecke, a lot of
their holdings are--I think

00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:31.367
Z is the beginning
of, of, you know,

00:34:31.367 --> 00:34:35.700
rare books collection--ZA
blank.&nbsp; And for the James

00:34:35.700 --> 00:34:37.700
Weldon Johnson collection,
which is the umbrella for

00:34:37.700 --> 00:34:40.700
the, the works that Van
Vechten got brought over to

00:34:40.700 --> 00:34:43.967
Yale, it's ZAN for
"Negro."&nbsp; I mean,

00:34:43.967 --> 00:34:47.600
it's just this--it's just
the way things get coded.&nbsp; I

00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:50.200
mean this is our culture
in which we live.&nbsp; Anyway,

00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:52.600
Carl Van Vechten was
responsible for having

00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:58.467
created at Yale an amazing
repository of black arts.&nbsp;

00:34:58.467 --> 00:35:01.867
He's also responsible for
writing a very controversial

00:35:04.067 --> 00:35:08.200
book.&nbsp; And this is
not super high quality,

00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:12.367
but a copy of its
cover, Negro--Nigger Heaven,

00:35:12.367 --> 00:35:15.567
a book that a lot of
other black leaders were,

00:35:15.567 --> 00:35:19.367
were horrified that he
would turn on the race in a

00:35:19.367 --> 00:35:22.867
sense.&nbsp; But some are saying,
well--it's about Harlem.&nbsp;

00:35:22.867 --> 00:35:26.200
It's about the Renaissance,
and it's about the--it's

00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:29.900
really not--shall we say,
it's a clumsy book.&nbsp; It's

00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:32.267
very overwrought and
dramatic.&nbsp; It's about,

00:35:32.267 --> 00:35:34.100
you know, the mysterious
beat of the tom-tom,

00:35:34.100 --> 00:35:37.300
and, you know, the, the
whirling dancers and all

00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:40.500
these sort of things, highly
romanticized.&nbsp; You can see

00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:43.200
here, you know, highly
stylized African material

00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:48.100
forms as well.&nbsp; Some black
leaders thought this was,

00:35:48.100 --> 00:35:50.000
you know, spot on,
exactly right.&nbsp; Others,

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:52.667
most, were actually
horrified that Van Vechten

00:35:52.667 --> 00:35:54.300
would publish a
book like this,

00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:59.200
certainly with this title.&nbsp;
So patronage coming in

00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:01.667
different forms
was, was complicated,

00:36:01.667 --> 00:36:04.700
just flat out complicated.&nbsp;
And that's partly what Scene

00:36:04.700 --> 00:36:06.867
of Harlem Cabaret you're
reading for this week is

00:36:06.867 --> 00:36:09.300
getting at.&nbsp; Now I
mentioned earlier,

00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:12.800
we need to think of the
Renaissance as a movement,

00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:14.400
and one that
involved white fascination,

00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:18.700
and also as a movement of
binaries that combined,

00:36:18.700 --> 00:36:20.467
a movement that combined
in one space seeming

00:36:20.467 --> 00:36:22.600
opposites.&nbsp; The most
important binary in this

00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:26.500
regard is America and
Africa.&nbsp; That Africa was

00:36:26.500 --> 00:36:29.300
being hailed and celebrated
at all was revolutionary.&nbsp;

00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:30.900
And I don't want to
dismiss this point of the

00:36:30.900 --> 00:36:34.400
Renaissance, because it's
really quite important.&nbsp;

00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:38.700
That Africa, the lands--the
land mass and its people,

00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:40.800
was being interpreted as
contributing something

00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:47.300
worthwhile to civilization
was a radical break.&nbsp; And

00:36:47.300 --> 00:36:49.600
one can see this often in
the famous work by Aaron

00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:51.700
Douglas, who
actually did this cover,

00:36:51.700 --> 00:36:56.000
but also produced a lot
of other art from the

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:59.000
Renaissance--that is
recognized as some of the

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:01.200
most important
paintings, visual art,

00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:05.500
from the Renaissance.&nbsp; And
you see in Douglas an artist

00:37:05.500 --> 00:37:09.400
doing sort of the heavy
lifting of bringing African

00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:13.200
cultural styles, you
know, starkly angular,

00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:16.267
and bringing them into an
American narr--narration,

00:37:16.267 --> 00:37:19.167
into an American scene.&nbsp; And
we can see this really in

00:37:19.167 --> 00:37:22.100
several murals that he--it's
a six-panel mural that's at

00:37:22.100 --> 00:37:24.600
the Schomburg Research
Center in New York City.&nbsp;

00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:26.667
And there's
several of--these are,

00:37:26.667 --> 00:37:30.200
you know, they're
actually bigger than this,

00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:36.500
large-scale paintings, that
tell a story of the African

00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:40.700
diaspora to the United
States and what this

00:37:40.700 --> 00:37:41.800
diaspora involves.

00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:46.600
In--and I'll show you four
of these panels.&nbsp; In the

00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:49.867
first, you have "The
Negro in an African Setting,

00:37:49.867 --> 00:37:51.900
 an exhortation of the
culturally vibrant African

00:37:51.900 --> 00:37:57.300
past, with the ring shout
religious tradition being

00:37:57.300 --> 00:38:01.400
practiced and drums, dances
in the state of ecstasy.

00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:03.200
And you'll see in these
images I'm going to show you

00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:08.200
here themes of,
well-stylized forms,

00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:13.500
but also circles and light.&nbsp;
That's what ties the images,

00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:15.900
the paintings, together.&nbsp;
You have the arrival of the

00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:21.700
ships in this painting,
Africans now in shackles,

00:38:21.700 --> 00:38:23.300
not knowing what
their future possesses,

00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:28.067
holds for them.&nbsp; Ships
coming to see them.&nbsp; You

00:38:28.067 --> 00:38:30.500
have a beam of light
coming in from the distance,

00:38:30.500 --> 00:38:32.900
as you'll see, sort of
forming a triangle you'll

00:38:32.900 --> 00:38:34.267
see in other images.

00:38:34.267 --> 00:38:37.800
You see it again right away
here.&nbsp; Now you have an ideal

00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:41.900
of the Deep South.&nbsp; We see
echoes of the African past,

00:38:41.900 --> 00:38:46.967
certainly in the body forms
and shapes.&nbsp; We also see,

00:38:46.967 --> 00:38:49.400
right--going from
right--from your right to

00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:56.400
your left,
expressions of hard labor,

00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:58.067
of celebration
in the circle,

00:38:58.067 --> 00:39:01.000
again, invoking
the, the ring circle,

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:05.567
playing African--instruments
with African roots like the

00:39:05.567 --> 00:39:10.000
banjo, but also playing the
guitar.&nbsp; The movement heads

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:13.700
you from right to left,
and you see in the distance,

00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:17.567
to the left, the North
Star.&nbsp; This is that beam of

00:39:17.567 --> 00:39:21.400
light cutting through, the
North Star as a path toward

00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:23.900
freedom.&nbsp; What you
also see though,

00:39:23.900 --> 00:39:25.600
and I can't reach it.

00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:28.600
I'll use the mouse to
get up there.&nbsp; Up here,

00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:34.300
right here, see somebody
hung and a lynch rope coming

00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:39.867
down.&nbsp; So the ideal of the
deep South is hard work,

00:39:39.867 --> 00:39:43.100
cultural
celebration, tragedy,

00:39:43.100 --> 00:39:48.500
horrific tragedy, and a
future elsewhere.&nbsp; And what

00:39:48.500 --> 00:39:54.500
was elsewhere?&nbsp; The promised
land.&nbsp; Shackles are broken

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:05.900
right here.&nbsp; The Civil War
is mentioned visually.&nbsp; The

00:40:05.900 --> 00:40:07.967
promised land, the land of
factories in the future.&nbsp;

00:40:12.500 --> 00:40:14.067
You have in these
images--and I've gone

00:40:14.067 --> 00:40:16.800
through very quickly,
looking at my time--the

00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:18.500
binaries of,
you know, African

00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:23.400
primitive--prim--primitivened
ss--that can't be the right

00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:29.700
word.&nbsp; Civilized,
organized, North,

00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:35.100
freedom, industrial.&nbsp; The
tragedies and the triumphs

00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:37.867
involved in the migration
from one place to another.&nbsp;

00:40:42.467 --> 00:40:45.800
You also have in--and
that's in the visual arts,

00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:48.367
in one sort of expressive
moment--you have this

00:40:48.367 --> 00:40:50.900
binary, this wrestling with
the African-ness and the

00:40:50.900 --> 00:40:53.000
American-ness in
poetry as well.&nbsp; I mean,

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.000
you've heard some of the
messier versions in Countee

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:59.200
Cullen's heritage.&nbsp; Langston
Hughes the--again one of the

00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:03.300
most famous artists of
prose in the Renaissance,

00:41:03.300 --> 00:41:07.400
writes the poem, "Negro
Speaks of Rivers."&nbsp; It's

00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:10.700
often hailed as sort of one
of the great documents of

00:41:10.700 --> 00:41:11.700
the Renaissance.

00:41:11.700 --> 00:41:14.300
Langston
Hughes:&nbsp; The poem is,

00:41:14.300 --> 00:41:16.500
The Negro Speaks of Rivers.&nbsp;
It was written when I was 18

00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:19.100
years old...

00:41:19.100 --> 00:41:19.700
Professor Jonathan
Holloway:&nbsp; No pressure.

00:41:19.700 --> 00:41:20.900
Langston Hughes:&nbsp; ...just
out of high school.&nbsp;

00:41:20.900 --> 00:41:23.700
It goes like this.

00:41:23.700 --> 00:41:27.767
"I've known rivers: I've
known rivers ancient as the

00:41:27.767 --> 00:41:32.467
world and older than the
flow of human blood in human

00:41:32.467 --> 00:41:35.600
veins. My soul has
grown deep like the rivers.

00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:39.267
I bathed in the Euphrates
when dawns were young.

00:41:39.267 --> 00:41:44.500
I built my hut near the Congo
and it lulled me to sleep.

00:41:44.500 --> 00:41:48.500
I looked upon the Nile and
raised the pyramids above it.

00:41:48.500 --> 00:41:50.700
I heard the singing of the
Mississippi when Abe Lincoln

00:41:50.700 --> 00:41:54.500
went down to New Orleans, and
I've seen its muddy bosom turn

00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:57.600
all golden in the sunset.

00:41:57.600 --> 00:42:02.567
I've known rivers:
Ancient, dusky rivers.

00:42:02.567 --> 00:42:04.600
My soul has grown deep
like the rivers."

00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:10.600
I don't think we need to
spend much time interpreting

00:42:12.767 --> 00:42:14.300
this poem, but
it is seen as,

00:42:14.300 --> 00:42:16.600
again, one of these great
documents that ties together

00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:19.667
a lot of the different
strands of the Renaissance.

00:42:21.900 --> 00:42:24.500
Hughes is talking about the
great rivers of the world,

00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:28.400
and he's also talking about
places where there were

00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:31.800
ancient civilizations.&nbsp; And
he's connecting these great

00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:34.267
rivers with ancient
civilizations that were

00:42:34.267 --> 00:42:39.600
black African
civilizations.&nbsp; And he's

00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:41.067
saying, sort of,
deep in my blood,

00:42:41.067 --> 00:42:44.300
I've known them all, I,
sort of the black man,

00:42:44.300 --> 00:42:48.000
the black individual, knows
them all.&nbsp; "My soul has

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:53.867
grown deep like the
rivers."&nbsp; So there is in the

00:42:53.867 --> 00:42:56.267
Renaissance a harkening back
to an ancient time and a

00:42:56.267 --> 00:43:03.300
place.&nbsp; Even in this
poem's simplicity,

00:43:03.300 --> 00:43:05.367
we see this
harkening back and this,

00:43:05.367 --> 00:43:09.700
this reaching for something
of value in a civilized

00:43:09.700 --> 00:43:13.300
past.&nbsp; Now this reaching
back to an African past,

00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:17.400
although remarkable for
even the fact of celebrating

00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:21.100
anything African, was not
without controversy.&nbsp; A

00:43:21.100 --> 00:43:23.100
figure named
George Schuyler,

00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:29.100
popular syndicated
column--columnist and author

00:43:31.767 --> 00:43:33.900
who becomes--who's a
gadfly sort of and becomes

00:43:33.900 --> 00:43:36.100
incredibly conservative over
the next thirty or forty

00:43:36.100 --> 00:43:39.167
years.&nbsp; He's un--politically
unpredictable at this

00:43:39.167 --> 00:43:44.300
point.&nbsp; He writes an essay
called "The Negro Art Hokum"

00:43:44.300 --> 00:43:47.767
in the Nation, the magazine
called the Nation.&nbsp; And he

00:43:47.767 --> 00:43:50.867
says that Negro
Americans, his words,

00:43:50.867 --> 00:43:54.000
were "little more
than lamp--lamp blacked

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:57.667
Anglo-Saxons;" that the
best black artists merely

00:43:57.667 --> 00:44:02.400
imitated white style, highly
stylized European style,

00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:06.267
and failed to demonstrate
their own.&nbsp; That any black

00:44:06.267 --> 00:44:09.400
art worth knowing
was really--you know,

00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:10.967
a white artist would
have done the same thing,

00:44:10.967 --> 00:44:14.967
but maybe with a black
subject.&nbsp; A week later,

00:44:14.967 --> 00:44:16.767
Langston Hughes, who you
just heard him reading his

00:44:16.767 --> 00:44:19.300
own poem, responds with
a very famous document,

00:44:19.300 --> 00:44:23.800
"The Negro Artist and the
Racial Mountain."&nbsp; This is

00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:28.067
in your reading of course.&nbsp;
Seen as also another central

00:44:28.067 --> 00:44:29.067
text of the era.

00:44:29.067 --> 00:44:32.200
&nbsp;And he says in that piece
it's the duty of the black

00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:36.100
artist to reach back, to
sort of speak of rivers,

00:44:36.100 --> 00:44:39.200
if you will, and develop the
culture that defined their

00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:45.067
life, be it African, rural,
or southern.&nbsp; Blacks had to

00:44:45.067 --> 00:44:47.700
make--had to make a
claim, according to Hughes,

00:44:47.700 --> 00:44:49.700
had to make a claim on
their own blackness,

00:44:49.700 --> 00:44:52.400
articulated it in
their own terms,

00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:55.300
and in their own ways.&nbsp;
They were not lamp-blacked

00:44:55.300 --> 00:44:58.700
Anglo-Saxons.&nbsp; They
were their own being.&nbsp; But

00:44:58.700 --> 00:45:01.100
articulating blackness
could mean different things,

00:45:01.100 --> 00:45:06.400
of course.&nbsp; Even if one
distanced himself or herself

00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:11.200
from the highly
stylized African past,

00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:12.900
something that's often
seen in sort of these

00:45:12.900 --> 00:45:15.200
condescending ways, like
through people like Carl Van

00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:18.400
Vechten with his, you know,
mysterious tom-tom and such,

00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:23.400
were black Americans,
if they're not African,

00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:24.967
well, are they southern?&nbsp;
What does it mean to be

00:45:24.967 --> 00:45:27.867
southern?&nbsp; Are they rural?&nbsp;
What does it mean to be

00:45:27.867 --> 00:45:29.300
rural?&nbsp; These are some
of these early things I

00:45:29.300 --> 00:45:31.467
mentioned at the beginning
of the lecture about what

00:45:31.467 --> 00:45:34.167
the Renaissance was.&nbsp; It
was pulling from all these

00:45:34.167 --> 00:45:37.267
different kinds of lived
experiences and imagined

00:45:37.267 --> 00:45:41.100
experiences, but never
without controversy.&nbsp; Black

00:45:41.100 --> 00:45:43.200
leaders were angry at
Langston Hughes and Zora

00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:46.700
Neale Hurston.&nbsp; And if you
remember back a week or so,

00:45:46.700 --> 00:45:50.500
with Sterling Brown even,
for writing in dialect,

00:45:50.500 --> 00:45:55.200
for using folk dialect.&nbsp; So
many black leaders and other

00:45:55.200 --> 00:45:56.200
black artists
are saying, "Look,

00:45:56.200 --> 00:45:59.400
we're not going to be
respected if we start,

00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:05.067
you know, talking like 'the
folk.'&nbsp; We don't want to

00:46:05.067 --> 00:46:06.900
celebrate that.&nbsp; We want
to celebrate these highly

00:46:06.900 --> 00:46:10.600
stylized forms."&nbsp; So what do
you get?&nbsp; You get profoundly

00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:14.000
mixed messages about what is
valued and what is valuable

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:19.500
during this era.&nbsp;
Revealing block--excuse me,

00:46:19.500 --> 00:46:22.600
black folk dialect was
counterproductive to the

00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:25.100
political project that
Du Bois-- that Locke

00:46:25.100 --> 00:46:28.200
envisioned, of demonstrating
black excellence.&nbsp; Just hang

00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:31.167
on with me a couple more
minutes here.&nbsp; The desire to

00:46:31.167 --> 00:46:34.600
move away from the rural
folk experience was also

00:46:34.600 --> 00:46:38.300
accompanied by a heightened
sense of blacks as exotic.&nbsp;

00:46:38.300 --> 00:46:39.867
The white gaze in the U.S.

00:46:39.867 --> 00:46:42.800
and abroad made superstars
out of performers like

00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:46.600
Josephine Baker, who in
the--this publicity still

00:46:46.600 --> 00:46:49.100
you see here, one of her
most famous images that was

00:46:49.100 --> 00:46:54.300
marketed, famous for her
banana dance.&nbsp; Not getting

00:46:54.300 --> 00:46:57.000
any traction in the U.S.,
she goes off to France and

00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:02.400
becomes a humongous star in
France.&nbsp; But it makes you

00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:06.000
wonder at what
cost, you know,

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:07.800
at what cost did
this conversion come,

00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:10.767
harking back to the
beginning of the class?&nbsp;

00:47:10.767 --> 00:47:15.967
What was lost when Baker
develops her power and her

00:47:15.967 --> 00:47:18.200
international fame when
she dons the banana skirt,

00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:25.800
often topless, as a
native African woman,

00:47:25.800 --> 00:47:29.367
using the bananas in her
skirt to entice a sleeping

00:47:29.367 --> 00:47:32.200
white explorer?&nbsp;
What's being lost in the

00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:35.000
transaction, even though
something really quite

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:38.600
amazing is being gained as
well?&nbsp; Is it a step forward

00:47:38.600 --> 00:47:43.200
for one, but a large step
backward of the people?&nbsp; So

00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:47.100
the Renaissance is many
competing narratives,

00:47:47.100 --> 00:47:48.900
as it would inevitably be
with all these different

00:47:48.900 --> 00:47:54.267
people producing arts and
ideas and culture.&nbsp; And then

00:47:54.267 --> 00:47:56.067
it begs the question,
because of these competing

00:47:56.067 --> 00:48:00.200
narratives, who is the
Renaissance for?&nbsp; Was it for

00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:04.000
blacks, was it for whites,
was it for the wealthy,

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:07.300
was it for workers?&nbsp; Was it
just about art and notions

00:48:07.300 --> 00:48:09.800
of beauty?&nbsp; Beauty is
a complicated thing.

00:48:09.800 --> 00:48:12.700
I'm just going very quickly
here.&nbsp; This is also the era

00:48:12.700 --> 00:48:16.200
of celebrating blackness,
celebrating African forms.&nbsp;

00:48:16.200 --> 00:48:17.700
But it also, Madam C.J.

00:48:17.700 --> 00:48:19.700
Walker becomes the
most powerful black

00:48:19.700 --> 00:48:21.700
businesswoman, a
multimillionaire,

00:48:21.700 --> 00:48:23.700
by selling hair
straightening products and

00:48:23.700 --> 00:48:28.000
skin lightening creams,
idealizing white beauty.&nbsp; I

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:31.200
already showed you this
image earlier that the

00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:34.000
Renaissance, the New Negro
mentality is about a certain

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:38.000
kind of anger and political
stance.&nbsp; And then the last

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:42.000
image here, in this
image you start seeing the

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:45.867
Renaissance as being larger
than just the arts.&nbsp; It's

00:48:45.867 --> 00:48:50.100
larger than just Harlem.&nbsp;
It's more than just words.&nbsp;

00:48:50.100 --> 00:48:51.467
This is a picture
of Fredi Washington,

00:48:51.467 --> 00:48:53.300
one of the--one of the
great performers of the

00:48:53.300 --> 00:48:55.200
Renaissance, a
dancer, most famously,

00:48:55.200 --> 00:48:58.300
and an actress.&nbsp; And she
forms--she joins a group

00:48:58.300 --> 00:49:02.067
called the Negro Artists
Guild during this era.&nbsp; You

00:49:02.067 --> 00:49:04.267
know and it's no mistaking
the fact that she has

00:49:04.267 --> 00:49:06.900
lighter skin and she has
"good hair" as the phrase

00:49:06.900 --> 00:49:08.300
would have been, and
actually still is in many

00:49:08.300 --> 00:49:10.867
places.&nbsp; But notice her
armband.&nbsp; She's wearing a

00:49:10.867 --> 00:49:16.567
protest armband.&nbsp; It's of a
person being lynched.&nbsp; That

00:49:16.567 --> 00:49:19.067
there's such
resistance to, you know,

00:49:19.067 --> 00:49:21.800
anti-lynching campaigns that
artists were joining these

00:49:21.800 --> 00:49:24.900
campaigns through their
own artistic slash political

00:49:24.900 --> 00:49:29.300
guilds in this case.&nbsp; So the
Renaissance is all of these

00:49:29.300 --> 00:49:35.167
things, in small ways and,
and going in these different

00:49:35.167 --> 00:49:36.200
directions, but
taken together,

00:49:36.200 --> 00:49:39.500
it is a movement of an
ideology that comes out of a

00:49:39.500 --> 00:49:42.300
movement of people that
wrestles with the current

00:49:42.300 --> 00:49:44.200
sort of racial
ideologies of the time,

00:49:44.200 --> 00:49:46.800
turns them upside down.&nbsp; It
celebrates at the same time

00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:50.700
it dismisses and it engages
in the world in terms of

00:49:50.700 --> 00:49:52.600
producing new
art in new ways,

00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:57.600
but also visiting old
battles in images you see

00:49:57.600 --> 00:50:00.300
like here, with Fredi
Washington protesting

00:50:00.300 --> 00:50:02.900
lynching and the lack of
anti-lynching laws in the

00:50:02.900 --> 00:50:04.867
United States.&nbsp; Thanks for
hanging on a couple more

00:50:04.867 --> 00:50:09.467
minutes, and have
fun in the snow.

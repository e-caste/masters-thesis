00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:05.898
Prof: So today,
as you can see on the syllabus,

00:00:05.898 --> 00:00:10.700
the lecture is titled
"Organizing a War"--

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:16.537
and on this past Thursday,
I talked about the opening

00:00:16.537 --> 00:00:21.240
phases of what basically--
as I described it--is a civil

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:21.510
war.
 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.060
I talked about opening
hostilities,

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.055
including Lexington and
Concord, and I showed how even

00:00:29.055 --> 00:00:34.352
with these opening hostilities,
still we could see how long it

00:00:34.352 --> 00:00:37.700
took before independence was
actually declared.

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.818
Basically, launching a civil
war was not an easy decision,

00:00:41.818 --> 00:00:45.070
or for a time at least,
even a logical one.

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.906
Nor was organizing and fighting
a civil war easy,

00:00:48.906 --> 00:00:53.301
particularly for thirteen
colonies that were not used to

00:00:53.301 --> 00:00:54.980
acting in unison.
 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.340
And as we saw really early on
in the course,

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.972
the colonies tended to come
together for purposes of

00:01:00.972 --> 00:01:05.094
self-defense when necessary,
and then when no longer

00:01:05.094 --> 00:01:09.927
necessary they were definitely
not joined together in joint

00:01:09.927 --> 00:01:12.010
cause past that point.
 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.194
So the colonies and then states
did not naturally fall into a

00:01:15.194 --> 00:01:18.060
union of some kind unless there
was danger at hand--

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.760
and often only when danger was
at hand.

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.944
Well, today what we're going to
be looking at is some of the

00:01:25.944 --> 00:01:29.480
challenges facing these--
well, now they're states,

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.010
now that we've declared
independence--

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:35.301
thirteen states when they came
together in the opening phases

00:01:35.301 --> 00:01:37.769
of this civil war for their
mutual defense.

00:01:37.769 --> 00:01:40.010
And as we're going to see
during the lecture,

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.190
on the one hand,
given that togetherness was not

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.830
really their natural state of
being,

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.537
they did manage to accomplish
quite a bit convened in the

00:01:49.537 --> 00:01:51.060
Continental Congress.
 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.596
But on the other hand,
the process of organizing a war

00:01:54.596 --> 00:01:58.800
did not end up being a very
efficient business in many ways,

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.581
and that's really going to be
the main subject of what I'm

00:02:01.581 --> 00:02:02.950
going to talk about today.
 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.271
And the experience of trying to
accomplish things with only a

00:02:07.271 --> 00:02:11.663
weak Continental Congress acting
as the central organizational

00:02:11.663 --> 00:02:15.480
body actually ended up
convincing some people down the

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.802
road that a stronger government
than that one was going to be

00:02:19.802 --> 00:02:23.620
necessary when people were
trying to figure out a more

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.949
permanent form of government for
these newly independent states.

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:31.705
So one of the things I'll be
showing and talking about by the

00:02:31.705 --> 00:02:34.461
end of the lecture is the ways
in which real life experiences

00:02:34.461 --> 00:02:37.080
were convincing some people or
teaching some people--

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.008
even a better word--lessons
about governance in these new

00:02:41.008 --> 00:02:42.759
states,
and about what they thought

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:44.199
worked and what they thought
didn't.

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:47.400
There was never great uniform
agreement,

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.536
but you'll see why some people
emerged from the Revolutionary

00:02:50.536 --> 00:02:53.200
War effort thinking that
something stronger and more

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.770
centralized was necessary.
 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:55.223
Okay.
 

00:02:55.223 --> 00:02:59.942
So now let's turn to the
Continental Congress and how

00:02:59.942 --> 00:03:02.120
they organized a war.
 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.215
Now the effort really began in
earnest in May of 1775 when the

00:03:06.215 --> 00:03:09.907
Second Continental Congress was
first sitting just after

00:03:09.907 --> 00:03:13.710
Lexington and Concord,
because it was in May of 1775

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:17.485
that the Continental Congress
took direction of colonial

00:03:17.485 --> 00:03:20.848
military resistance to the
British by creating the

00:03:20.848 --> 00:03:22.360
Continental Army.
 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.158
Now, I ended Thursday's lecture
with a quote by John Adams from

00:03:26.158 --> 00:03:29.591
a letter that he wrote to
Abigail in which he was summing

00:03:29.591 --> 00:03:32.408
up some of the challenges facing
Congress.

00:03:32.408 --> 00:03:35.223
I'll repeat it here because
it's going to outline some of

00:03:35.223 --> 00:03:37.986
the things that I'm--we will be
talking about in today's

00:03:37.986 --> 00:03:38.590
lecture.
 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.535
And what Adams wrote was:
"When 50 or 60 Men have a

00:03:42.535 --> 00:03:46.000
Constitution to form for a great
Empire,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.821
at the same Time that they have
a country of 1500 Miles extent

00:03:47.821 --> 00:03:49.988
to fortify,
Millions to arm and train,

00:03:49.988 --> 00:03:53.020
a Naval Power to begin,
an extensive Commerce to

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:56.229
regulate, numerous Tribes of
Indians to negotiate with,

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:59.090
a standing Army of Twenty seven
Thousand Men to raise pay,

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.193
victual, and officer,
I shall really pity those 50 or

00:04:02.193 --> 00:04:03.090
60 men."
 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:03.360
Okay.
 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.122
So that's Adams writing to
Abigail basically saying,

00:04:06.122 --> 00:04:08.343
'Oh, my God,
this is what we have in front

00:04:08.343 --> 00:04:08.939
of us.
 

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:11.180
This will not be easy.'
 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.697
And you can see in that quote
the scope of the task that

00:04:14.697 --> 00:04:17.637
really did lie before the
Continental Congress:

00:04:17.637 --> 00:04:20.899
figuring out how to govern the
thirteen states;

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:23.230
worrying about issues having to
do with commerce;

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:27.000
negotiating with Native
Americans;

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.396
and of course in war time--most
central of all given military

00:04:30.396 --> 00:04:33.850
hostilities that were right at
hand--creating and supplying an

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:34.360
army.
 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:39.250
And it's that latter task that
I'm going to focus on at the

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:40.009
moment.
 

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:42.401
I'm going to be looking at how
the Continental Congress created

00:04:42.401 --> 00:04:43.829
and supplied the Continental
Army,

00:04:43.829 --> 00:04:47.122
because in a lot of ways,
when you look at all of the

00:04:47.122 --> 00:04:51.047
complications and controversies
surrounding the creation of the

00:04:51.047 --> 00:04:54.557
Continental Army,
you get a great case study of

00:04:54.557 --> 00:04:58.867
many of the problems that were
at the heart of any effort at

00:04:58.867 --> 00:05:02.519
unity between the colonies and
then the states.

00:05:02.519 --> 00:05:05.531
And not surprisingly,
as we're going to see down the

00:05:05.531 --> 00:05:08.899
road in this course when we talk
more about the 1780s,

00:05:08.899 --> 00:05:11.500
many of these problems
certainly did persist as

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.990
problems not only through the
Revolution,

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:16.747
but through the 1780s,
through the nation's first

00:05:16.747 --> 00:05:19.470
decades,
and in some cases long

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:20.610
thereafter.
 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:22.865
So in a sense,
you can look at the creation of

00:05:22.865 --> 00:05:25.773
the Continental Army as a kind
of case study in some of the

00:05:25.773 --> 00:05:28.480
problems involved with creating
an American union.

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:33.232
Now given what I've just said
about problems inherent in

00:05:33.232 --> 00:05:36.779
creating a union,
it's not surprising that one of

00:05:36.779 --> 00:05:39.069
the first problems to present
itself,

00:05:39.069 --> 00:05:42.069
as far as the Continental Army
is concerned,

00:05:42.069 --> 00:05:43.680
was regionalism.
 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.795
I'm going to talk in a moment
about localism,

00:05:45.795 --> 00:05:48.199
but for now I'm going to talk
about regionalism.

00:05:48.199 --> 00:05:50.240
You might think that in a
moment of crisis,

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:55.000
regionalism might entirely fall
by the wayside,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.223
and I suppose in some ways it
did, but definitely not

00:05:58.223 --> 00:06:01.076
completely and,
as I'm going to talk about in a

00:06:01.076 --> 00:06:03.100
moment,
you can see this particularly

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:06.141
when you talk about the issue of
who's going to command the

00:06:06.141 --> 00:06:07.189
Continental Army.
 

00:06:07.189 --> 00:06:12.240
I remember when I was first
working on my book,

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.500
which is about politics in the
1790s,

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:18.449
and I thought --without looking
into it very much--

00:06:18.449 --> 00:06:21.230
that what I was going to find
when I started looking at

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:24.528
letters from the period was that
there'd be this little honeymoon

00:06:24.528 --> 00:06:26.639
nationalism moment where
everyone thought:

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:28.639
'well,
we just created a Constitution

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:31.752
and we're not sure about it,
but let's hang in there and be

00:06:31.752 --> 00:06:34.423
national together,
and let's not really focus on

00:06:34.423 --> 00:06:36.370
regionalism for just a little
while.'

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:39.310
And that maybe there'd be this
little honeymoon moment and then

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:42.300
that might sort of wane and then
people would get more back into

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:44.529
their entrenched sort of
regional outlooks.

00:06:44.529 --> 00:06:47.392
And what I found is that no,
there wasn't a honeymoon

00:06:47.392 --> 00:06:48.550
nationalism moment.
 

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:50.209
[laughs]
It just--It never happened--

00:06:50.209 --> 00:06:53.788
that even as soon as the
national government is launched

00:06:53.788 --> 00:06:56.110
in the 1790s,
even when people have decided

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:57.798
to commit,
at least for the present,

00:06:57.798 --> 00:07:01.281
to this new Constitution,
they were still thinking about:

00:07:01.281 --> 00:07:03.363
Southerners,
'I don't know if we trust the

00:07:03.363 --> 00:07:04.439
Northerners'--
Northerners,

00:07:04.439 --> 00:07:06.300
'I don't know if I trust the
Southerners.'

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:10.158
I remember finding a letter
from one Southerner to another

00:07:10.158 --> 00:07:14.221
Southerner from the first year
or two that the government was

00:07:14.221 --> 00:07:16.781
in existence,
and the one Southerner says to

00:07:16.781 --> 00:07:19.567
the other,
'I think we should try as hard

00:07:19.567 --> 00:07:23.987
as we can to get as many young
men in clerkships in this new

00:07:23.987 --> 00:07:28.124
government as possible,
because they're going to

00:07:28.124 --> 00:07:32.000
gradually be promoted into
higher offices,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.685
and sooner or later Southern
men will be in control of most

00:07:33.685 --> 00:07:35.966
of the national offices,
which is much better than being

00:07:35.966 --> 00:07:38.190
governed by a bunch of arrogant
Northerners.'

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:38.375
Okay.
 

00:07:38.375 --> 00:07:40.276
This is the like--the
government hasn't even been in

00:07:40.276 --> 00:07:43.038
existence yet for two years,
and already people are like,

00:07:43.038 --> 00:07:44.889
'I don't know about that
other--

00:07:44.889 --> 00:07:46.000
those Northerners.'
 

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.290
So it doesn't--it waxes and
wanes;

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:51.180
it doesn't go away,
and so it's not surprising,

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:55.411
given that, that it pops up
right at the outset of the whole

00:07:55.411 --> 00:07:59.214
revolutionary enterprise,
particularly when people were

00:07:59.214 --> 00:08:01.752
thinking about a
commander-in-chief of the

00:08:01.752 --> 00:08:02.990
Continental Army.
 

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:05.076
Now obviously,
in and of itself it's an

00:08:05.076 --> 00:08:06.230
important decision.
 

00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:11.079
You want the right man for that
job, but it was complicated by

00:08:11.079 --> 00:08:12.670
regional concerns.
 

00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:16.439
Basically, many New Englanders
felt that since,

00:08:16.439 --> 00:08:18.680
during this early period of the
war,

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:22.629
most of the military action was
happening in New England--

00:08:22.629 --> 00:08:25.480
basically all the hostilities
we've been talking about much of

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:27.490
it certainly is going on in New
England--

00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:33.308
that a New Englander would be
the logical choice to lead the

00:08:33.308 --> 00:08:34.000
Army.
 

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.518
And some people even had the
sneaking suspicion that maybe

00:08:37.518 --> 00:08:40.974
New Englanders wouldn't be
willing to fight under anybody

00:08:40.974 --> 00:08:41.529
else.
 

00:08:41.529 --> 00:08:44.985
People thought about the way
that the New England militia

00:08:44.985 --> 00:08:46.220
operated as units.
 

00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:49.812
One of the striking things
about the New England militia

00:08:49.812 --> 00:08:52.950
was that they actually elected
their officers.

00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:53.193
Right?
 

00:08:53.193 --> 00:08:55.557
They--It wasn't like someone
was sort of enforced upon them

00:08:55.557 --> 00:08:56.250
as an officer.
 

00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:59.509
Militia units elected their own
officers--

00:08:59.509 --> 00:09:01.945
so, given that,
the thought was,

00:09:01.945 --> 00:09:05.009
given that kind of military
culture,

00:09:05.009 --> 00:09:08.154
having a Southerner thrust upon
them might not be welcomed with

00:09:08.154 --> 00:09:09.879
open arms by New England troops.
 

00:09:09.879 --> 00:09:14.038
On a much more minor note,
complicating matters was that--

00:09:14.038 --> 00:09:16.721
not only did some people think
a New Englander made the most

00:09:16.721 --> 00:09:18.994
sense,
but also John Hancock and some

00:09:18.994 --> 00:09:22.785
of his friends actually thought
that he was the guy who should

00:09:22.785 --> 00:09:24.340
be commander-in-chief.
 

00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:26.379
They had pretty much already
decided: John Hancock,

00:09:26.379 --> 00:09:28.866
he's the man,
just a matter of time before he

00:09:28.866 --> 00:09:32.090
gets nominated and made
commander-in-chief of the army.

00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:35.407
So for a variety of reasons
some people thought maybe a

00:09:35.407 --> 00:09:38.538
Southerner would not work as
commander-in-chief,

00:09:38.538 --> 00:09:41.714
but on the other hand there
were other people who felt just

00:09:41.714 --> 00:09:43.938
the opposite,
who actually thought that

00:09:43.938 --> 00:09:47.231
because a lot of what had been
happening so far had been going

00:09:47.231 --> 00:09:49.616
on in New England,
that New Englanders had been

00:09:49.616 --> 00:09:53.264
doing a lot of the fighting,
all the more reason to promote

00:09:53.264 --> 00:09:57.916
unity among the colonies by
finding someone who wasn't a New

00:09:57.916 --> 00:10:00.788
Englander,
by finding a Southerner to be

00:10:00.788 --> 00:10:03.899
commander-in-chief and suggest
that this was a joint

00:10:03.899 --> 00:10:07.009
continental effort and not some
New England war.

00:10:07.009 --> 00:10:09.272
And this kind of logic,
this kind of wondering about

00:10:09.272 --> 00:10:10.870
how do you balance out
positions,

00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:13.135
officerships,
cabinet offices,

00:10:13.135 --> 00:10:16.941
diplomatic posts--
this goes on and on and on

00:10:16.941 --> 00:10:19.009
throughout this period.
 

00:10:19.009 --> 00:10:20.311
The people are always very
concerned--whether you're

00:10:20.311 --> 00:10:21.918
talking about military positions
or whether you're talking about

00:10:21.918 --> 00:10:22.428
civil positions.
 

00:10:22.428 --> 00:10:25.360
Even Presidents had the same
problem.

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:29.240
Washington certainly has it
throughout the war as

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:31.979
commander-in-chief--
with this constant concern

00:10:31.979 --> 00:10:33.750
about trying to balance things
out regionally,

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:36.470
not just oh,
because it would seem fair,

00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:39.399
but actually if you think about
the fact that a union--

00:10:39.399 --> 00:10:43.009
whether you're talking about
the 1770s,

00:10:43.009 --> 00:10:45.361
the 1780s or the 1790s--if you
think about the fact that

00:10:45.361 --> 00:10:47.918
whatever kind of union you have,
it's pretty weak,

00:10:47.918 --> 00:10:51.279
if you actually don't think
about things like balancing

00:10:51.279 --> 00:10:55.014
between regions and different
positions of responsibility and

00:10:55.014 --> 00:10:57.509
authority,
the fear was that maybe parts

00:10:57.509 --> 00:11:00.250
of the union that didn't feel
included and didn't feel

00:11:00.250 --> 00:11:03.200
represented might actually just
pull out of the union.

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:08.230
And throughout this period,
actually later than one would

00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:09.946
think,
that was a constant

00:11:09.946 --> 00:11:12.807
threat--that sections of the
union would threaten to pull out

00:11:12.807 --> 00:11:15.621
because they felt that they
weren't really being included as

00:11:15.621 --> 00:11:16.720
important members.
 

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:21.009
Sort of again and again at key
moments,

00:11:21.009 --> 00:11:23.538
there's a little sort of threat
of secession that raises its

00:11:23.538 --> 00:11:25.980
head and then is sort of shoved
back down until finally it

00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:28.080
raises its head and is not
shoved back down,

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:30.668
but certainly that was a
logical fear.

00:11:30.668 --> 00:11:34.196
And so wondering about balance
was a problem for anyone who was

00:11:34.196 --> 00:11:37.950
in any position of authority or
command throughout this period,

00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:40.629
so in the case of the army,
commander-in-chief,

00:11:40.629 --> 00:11:43.950
obviously this is a big and
typical kind of a decision.

00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:46.870
So some favor Hancock.
 

00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:51.029
Others favored a Virginian
named George Washington.

00:11:51.029 --> 00:11:54.864
We've already seen Washington
did have military experience as

00:11:54.864 --> 00:11:58.379
an officer fighting during the
French and Indian War.

00:11:58.379 --> 00:12:01.220
He made a few choices that
perhaps were not the best.

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:04.985
However, he was someone who did
have extensive military

00:12:04.985 --> 00:12:09.379
experience fighting alongside or
as part of the British army.

00:12:09.379 --> 00:12:12.953
He also was a person--He really
did kind of have a commanding

00:12:12.953 --> 00:12:13.610
presence.
 

00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:18.086
He was someone who seemed like
he ought to be a military

00:12:18.086 --> 00:12:18.820
leader.
 

00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:22.048
A couple--Gosh.
 

00:12:22.048 --> 00:12:26.288
Probably a couple years ago,
I was giving a talk at Mount

00:12:26.288 --> 00:12:30.831
Vernon and they have a new sort
of museum education center at

00:12:30.831 --> 00:12:34.389
Mount Vernon which is actually
really big,

00:12:34.389 --> 00:12:37.230
really impressive--and one of
the things that they did,

00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:41.149
was they created three
life-scale exact models of

00:12:41.149 --> 00:12:44.658
George Washington at sort of key
moments.

00:12:44.658 --> 00:12:48.019
So you have Washington as a
surveyor,

00:12:48.019 --> 00:12:50.178
Washington during the
Revolution, Washington taking

00:12:50.178 --> 00:12:52.951
the oath of office as President,
and they literally measured his

00:12:52.951 --> 00:12:55.230
skull and did whatever they had
to do to make it like,

00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:57.340
exact George Washington.
 

00:12:57.340 --> 00:12:58.720
So I'm the historian.
 

00:12:58.720 --> 00:12:59.558
I'm giving the talk.
 

00:12:59.558 --> 00:13:01.000
I'm like, 'oh,
I have a little bit of time

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.506
before the talk,
I'll go wander around the

00:13:02.506 --> 00:13:04.284
visitor center'--
and I see--you know--there's

00:13:04.284 --> 00:13:06.265
Washington surveyor,
huh, well, who would have

00:13:06.265 --> 00:13:07.833
thought I would have seen--
there he is,

00:13:07.833 --> 00:13:08.860
it's kind of realistic looking.
 

00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:12.269
And then I wander into the
revolution room and--Okay.

00:13:12.269 --> 00:13:13.908
So however long I've been
studying this period,

00:13:13.908 --> 00:13:18.129
you see a bazillion times
people will say,

00:13:18.129 --> 00:13:20.750
"The man was an impressive
figure on a horse."

00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:22.648
Everyone finds a way of saying
that, "My,

00:13:22.648 --> 00:13:25.389
he was an impressive figure on
a horse, up on that white horse.

00:13:25.389 --> 00:13:26.668
What a man."
 

00:13:26.668 --> 00:13:28.206
One way or another,
everyone's sort of,

00:13:28.206 --> 00:13:29.985
'oh, oh, oh'--and I thought
yeah, yeah, okay,

00:13:29.985 --> 00:13:31.642
I know this,
impressive, impressive figure

00:13:31.642 --> 00:13:32.330
on a horse.
 

00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:34.448
So I walk into this room and
there's [laughs]

00:13:34.448 --> 00:13:36.601
Washington on the horse,
and without even thinking I

00:13:36.601 --> 00:13:38.740
said, "Wow,
he's an impressive figure."

00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:40.985
[laughter]
I was like okay,

00:13:40.985 --> 00:13:42.538
it must be true.
 

00:13:42.538 --> 00:13:44.850
[laughter]
I couldn't help myself.

00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:46.399
He was--like, really impressive.
 

00:13:46.399 --> 00:13:49.908
So he looked like someone who
ought to be in command.

00:13:49.908 --> 00:13:55.851
Another useful thing about
George Washington--You'll see

00:13:55.851 --> 00:14:02.120
it's a little complicated,
but he didn't seem ambitious.

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:02.402
Right?
 

00:14:02.402 --> 00:14:04.846
One of the overriding
assumptions of politics at this

00:14:04.846 --> 00:14:06.562
time is,
if you really are openly power

00:14:06.562 --> 00:14:08.734
hungry,
if you really are very openly

00:14:08.734 --> 00:14:10.775
ambitious,
you're the exact person who

00:14:10.775 --> 00:14:14.416
should not be given power,
particularly if you're looking

00:14:14.416 --> 00:14:18.799
at a republic or a confederation
or some kind of a form of

00:14:18.799 --> 00:14:22.028
government that's weak or shaky
or new.

00:14:22.028 --> 00:14:23.578
The thought is you get a
power-hungry person and you give

00:14:23.578 --> 00:14:25.552
that person power,
they're very likely to become a

00:14:25.552 --> 00:14:28.111
tyrant or a despot and then
basically seize control of the

00:14:28.111 --> 00:14:29.729
government and then
"poof,"

00:14:29.729 --> 00:14:32.379
everything is gone and now you
just have a despotism,

00:14:32.379 --> 00:14:35.730
so you don't want to give
ambitious people power.

00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:38.326
And George Washington,
though he did have any number

00:14:38.326 --> 00:14:41.952
of talents and skills,
and though he was certainly

00:14:41.952 --> 00:14:43.753
ambitious,
as you'll see in a moment,

00:14:43.753 --> 00:14:45.548
he wasn't the kind of guy who
seemed to be pulling for power.

00:14:45.548 --> 00:14:47.500
He wasn't the sort of guy who
was campaigning for himself.

00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:51.216
He wasn't the sort of guy who
was sort of pushing himself into

00:14:51.216 --> 00:14:52.009
situations.
 

00:14:52.009 --> 00:14:54.948
He really had kind of a modest
demeanor in how he presented

00:14:54.948 --> 00:14:57.230
himself when up for some kind of
an office.

00:14:57.230 --> 00:15:00.826
And a great example of that is
what happens when he shows up to

00:15:00.826 --> 00:15:03.325
the Continental Congress--
and he's named a delegate to

00:15:03.325 --> 00:15:05.429
the Continental Congress,
and he shows up,

00:15:05.429 --> 00:15:08.658
and he shows up in his military
uniform.

00:15:08.658 --> 00:15:08.990
Okay.
 

00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:11.710
He's the only guy in a military
uniform.

00:15:11.710 --> 00:15:12.095
Right?
 

00:15:12.095 --> 00:15:14.923
He shows up like:
'hi, I'm George Washington,

00:15:14.923 --> 00:15:16.210
guy in a uniform.
 

00:15:16.210 --> 00:15:17.928
Think George,
think command,

00:15:17.928 --> 00:15:20.538
think--He'll--He's not saying
anything.

00:15:20.538 --> 00:15:22.927
He's not campaigning,
but he's definitely putting the

00:15:22.927 --> 00:15:25.225
idea out there like:
'I'm a military guy and you're

00:15:25.225 --> 00:15:27.816
looking for one right now,
and here I am in my uniform

00:15:27.816 --> 00:15:29.629
waiting [laughter]
for you to notice me.'

00:15:29.629 --> 00:15:33.024
So it was a sort of skillful
play on his part to just sort of

00:15:33.024 --> 00:15:35.908
plant the subliminal message in
everyone's mind--

00:15:35.908 --> 00:15:40.090
so surely he wanted to be
commander-in-chief.

00:15:40.090 --> 00:15:44.427
And it ends up being Adams who
nominates Washington for the

00:15:44.427 --> 00:15:47.783
position of commander-in-chief,
which really,

00:15:47.783 --> 00:15:50.660
really irked John Hancock,
who thought that,

00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:53.687
as a Massachusetts man,
when Adams starts talking,

00:15:53.687 --> 00:15:56.230
that obviously Adams must be
talking about him.

00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:58.298
So before Adams says
Washington's name,

00:15:58.298 --> 00:16:00.748
sort of Hancock's like:
'ha, indeed that's me,

00:16:00.748 --> 00:16:02.110
I deserve this post.'
 

00:16:02.110 --> 00:16:04.590
And Adams actually later
recalls this.

00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:06.798
He says he stood up to nominate
Washington.

00:16:06.798 --> 00:16:09.301
He says that Washington,
who was sitting near the door

00:16:09.301 --> 00:16:11.162
of the room,
quote, "As soon as he

00:16:11.162 --> 00:16:13.481
heard me allude to him,
from his usual modesty,

00:16:13.481 --> 00:16:15.379
darted into the
library-room."

00:16:15.379 --> 00:16:15.607
Okay.
 

00:16:15.607 --> 00:16:18.307
So Adams stands up and says,
'I want to talk about commander

00:16:18.307 --> 00:16:20.413
in chief' and Washington goes
"boom,"

00:16:20.413 --> 00:16:21.729
out of the room,
[laughs]

00:16:21.729 --> 00:16:22.850
not that anyone will notice.
 

00:16:22.850 --> 00:16:24.530
It's like, 'no,
no, no, I don't want to be in

00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:24.990
the room.'
 

00:16:24.990 --> 00:16:27.875
So Adams presents his reasons
as to why he thinks this

00:16:27.875 --> 00:16:30.817
particular unnamed person would
be good for the post of

00:16:30.817 --> 00:16:32.070
commander-in-chief.
 

00:16:32.070 --> 00:16:35.389
Hancock thinks clearly that
Adams is talking about him.

00:16:35.389 --> 00:16:37.971
Adams says,
"Mr. Hancock,--who was

00:16:37.971 --> 00:16:39.330
our President...
 

00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:43.048
"--he's presiding over the
Continental Congress--

00:16:43.048 --> 00:16:44.422
"heard me with visible
pleasure,"

00:16:44.422 --> 00:16:46.480
until "I came to describe
Washington for the commander,

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:50.323
I never remarked a more sudden
and striking change of

00:16:50.323 --> 00:16:51.360
countenance.
 

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:54.852
Mortification and resentment
were expressed as forcibly as

00:16:54.852 --> 00:16:57.058
his face could exhibit
them."

00:16:57.058 --> 00:16:57.303
Okay.
 

00:16:57.303 --> 00:16:59.750
That's a really sort of nice
little moment there.

00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:01.158
Hancock was not pleased.
 

00:17:01.158 --> 00:17:06.026
However, Washington was
appointed commander--in-chief of

00:17:06.026 --> 00:17:09.298
the Continental Army,
June 15,1775.

00:17:09.298 --> 00:17:15.009
Now he may have been a good
person for this job.

00:17:15.009 --> 00:17:18.161
This is not to say he didn't
have regional prejudices of his

00:17:18.161 --> 00:17:21.258
own, and I think early in the
course I quoted him about New

00:17:21.258 --> 00:17:22.059
Englanders.
 

00:17:22.059 --> 00:17:23.058
Did I do that?
 

00:17:23.058 --> 00:17:23.471
Student: Yeah..
 

00:17:23.471 --> 00:17:23.808
Prof: Okay.
 

00:17:23.808 --> 00:17:24.108
I thought so.
 

00:17:24.108 --> 00:17:28.192
That's--That quote actually
comes from this moment in the

00:17:28.192 --> 00:17:28.848
course.
 

00:17:28.848 --> 00:17:32.250
That quote comes from when
Washington first goes up to New

00:17:32.250 --> 00:17:36.008
England to take his position as
commander-in-chief and meet this

00:17:36.008 --> 00:17:39.288
New England army that he's been
made commander of,

00:17:39.288 --> 00:17:41.919
and his response to looking at
the army is what I quoted

00:17:41.919 --> 00:17:44.787
before: "New Englanders are
an exceeding dirty and nasty

00:17:44.787 --> 00:17:45.598
people."
 

00:17:45.598 --> 00:17:45.867
Okay.
 

00:17:45.867 --> 00:17:48.388
That's George Washington,
father of our country,

00:17:48.388 --> 00:17:51.446
commander of the Continental
Army, on the army that he has

00:17:51.446 --> 00:17:52.519
just inherited.
 

00:17:52.519 --> 00:17:56.000
So he's not exactly thrilled.
 

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.766
He doesn't--He hasn't
necessarily commanded men like

00:17:58.766 --> 00:18:02.008
this before,
and he's also a little--I don't

00:18:02.008 --> 00:18:04.750
even know what the right word
is--

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:08.491
befuddled, struck,
by the mood or the way in which

00:18:08.491 --> 00:18:11.088
these troops conduct themselves.
 

00:18:11.088 --> 00:18:13.791
As I mentioned before,
New England is like a town

00:18:13.791 --> 00:18:16.888
meeting government kind of a
place, and they're electing

00:18:16.888 --> 00:18:19.308
their officers in their military
units.

00:18:19.308 --> 00:18:22.048
To Washington,
this--he just--this did not

00:18:22.048 --> 00:18:24.318
make sense, electing an officer?
 

00:18:24.318 --> 00:18:27.170
What kind of authority does an
elected officer have?

00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:29.630
He didn't like the idea.
 

00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:32.382
It was pretty foreign as far as
military thinking goes to

00:18:32.382 --> 00:18:34.794
Washington,
and he wasn't entirely sure

00:18:34.794 --> 00:18:38.689
that he could actually tell the
officers apart from the common

00:18:38.689 --> 00:18:40.728
soldiers,
which is probably true if

00:18:40.728 --> 00:18:42.759
they're electing people from
their midst.

00:18:42.759 --> 00:18:46.548
So Washington definitely saw
New Englanders as unfamiliar,

00:18:46.548 --> 00:18:49.471
to say the least,
when he took command of the

00:18:49.471 --> 00:18:51.400
Army--again, regionalism.
 

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:55.935
Regionalism was also apparent
in just the mere appearance of

00:18:55.935 --> 00:18:57.088
the soldiers.
 

00:18:57.088 --> 00:19:02.267
They came from ultimately
different parts of the

00:19:02.267 --> 00:19:04.028
confederation.
 

00:19:04.028 --> 00:19:06.142
Some of them were
striking-looking people who came

00:19:06.142 --> 00:19:08.253
from the frontier,
frontier riflemen from Virginia

00:19:08.253 --> 00:19:09.848
and I think Pennsylvania as
well.

00:19:09.848 --> 00:19:12.318
These were guys who were
dressed in hunting shirts.

00:19:12.318 --> 00:19:15.009
They didn't have formal
uniforms.

00:19:15.009 --> 00:19:17.426
They didn't carry muskets,
but instead they carried

00:19:17.426 --> 00:19:20.086
rifles, which were--seemed to be
sharp shooting--sharper

00:19:20.086 --> 00:19:22.068
shooting, I guess,
than a musket was.

00:19:22.068 --> 00:19:25.686
Some of them carried tomahawks
and they were very proud of

00:19:25.686 --> 00:19:27.210
their shooting skills.
 

00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:28.848
They were kind of a wild bunch.
 

00:19:28.848 --> 00:19:34.556
There is a rather eccentric
American general who will come

00:19:34.556 --> 00:19:37.058
up again in the course.
 

00:19:37.058 --> 00:19:39.057
His name is Charles Lee,
and he always referred to the

00:19:39.057 --> 00:19:40.413
riflemen, quote,
as "that damned

00:19:40.413 --> 00:19:41.130
riffraff."
 

00:19:41.130 --> 00:19:44.761
He just thought they were these
wild and crazy guys from out on

00:19:44.761 --> 00:19:46.930
the frontier armed with rifles
so--

00:19:46.930 --> 00:19:50.519
and Lee I should note--I'll
mention Lee again later.

00:19:50.519 --> 00:19:54.328
Lee--He's--Everyone describes
him as eccentric.

00:19:54.328 --> 00:19:58.029
Even Lee describes himself as
eccentric,

00:19:58.029 --> 00:20:00.570
but maybe one of the more
eccentric things about Charles

00:20:00.570 --> 00:20:03.160
Lee was that he had a pack of
dogs that he loved and that

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:06.528
followed him everywhere he went,
everywhere he went.

00:20:06.528 --> 00:20:10.038
If he went into a lady's
parlor, he had six dogs.

00:20:10.038 --> 00:20:12.534
If he went into a lady's
private chamber,

00:20:12.534 --> 00:20:14.903
apparently, he had six
dogs--[laughter]

00:20:14.903 --> 00:20:18.769
so this was not particularly
popular with the female kind.

00:20:18.769 --> 00:20:23.226
He's an eccentric individual
for a variety of reasons--and he

00:20:23.226 --> 00:20:26.346
ends up having a bad,
bad moment during the

00:20:26.346 --> 00:20:29.019
Revolution, which we'll come to.
 

00:20:29.019 --> 00:20:31.150
But anyway, so Charles--if
Charles Lee is calling people a

00:20:31.150 --> 00:20:33.279
damned riffraff [laughs],
that actually says something.

00:20:33.279 --> 00:20:38.019
So anyway, the riflemen were
kind of a wild crew.

00:20:38.019 --> 00:20:39.424
They saw themselves as the
elite of the army because of

00:20:39.424 --> 00:20:40.048
their shooting skills.
 

00:20:40.048 --> 00:20:43.098
They actually spent some time
sort of taking potshots at

00:20:43.098 --> 00:20:46.094
British officers on the line
until the British officers

00:20:46.094 --> 00:20:49.365
realized that there were these
kind of crazy riflemen taking

00:20:49.365 --> 00:20:52.477
shots at them,
and it would be good not to be

00:20:52.477 --> 00:20:54.098
out in the open anymore.
 

00:20:54.098 --> 00:20:57.108
They also just liked shooting
off their guns for fun.

00:20:57.108 --> 00:21:00.372
Ammunition supplies were very
low and this was not a good

00:21:00.372 --> 00:21:00.778
idea.
 

00:21:00.778 --> 00:21:03.570
I'll come back to this in a
minute, but they were a little

00:21:03.570 --> 00:21:04.108
bit wild.
 

00:21:04.108 --> 00:21:06.960
And they did not necessarily
like to be disciplined,

00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:10.750
so for example in one instance
there was one Virginia rifleman

00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:14.045
who was arrested for not
listening to orders and other

00:21:14.045 --> 00:21:16.778
riflemen stormed the jail and
freed him.

00:21:16.778 --> 00:21:17.077
Okay.
 

00:21:17.077 --> 00:21:20.603
This is not intense military
discipline taking place here at

00:21:20.603 --> 00:21:22.809
this time,
and of course on the other hand

00:21:22.809 --> 00:21:25.287
you couldn't give all kinds of
privileges to the riflemen

00:21:25.287 --> 00:21:27.410
because then all the other
troops would say,

00:21:27.410 --> 00:21:29.500
'Well, why are those guys
getting treated special,

00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:31.078
like they're better than us?'
 

00:21:31.078 --> 00:21:34.222
So the army is kind of a
conglomeration of different

00:21:34.222 --> 00:21:36.257
kinds of people,
different places,

00:21:36.257 --> 00:21:39.769
even different uniforms,
not just different behavior.

00:21:39.769 --> 00:21:44.784
So you can see just in the
matter of managing an army,

00:21:44.784 --> 00:21:49.420
regionalism can add
complications and problems.

00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:53.410
It's also a problem in a
slightly different form,

00:21:53.410 --> 00:21:56.170
and I'm going to call it
localism because I mean it in a

00:21:56.170 --> 00:21:58.630
slightly different way than I
mean regionalism.

00:21:58.630 --> 00:22:03.232
And what I mean by localism is,
people often tended to think of

00:22:03.232 --> 00:22:07.688
their own locality first and
foremost rather necessarily than

00:22:07.688 --> 00:22:11.028
of the good of the entire
American cause.

00:22:11.028 --> 00:22:12.741
So people thought about
wherever they were from first

00:22:12.741 --> 00:22:15.602
and foremost--
and along similar lines,

00:22:15.602 --> 00:22:21.239
they were distrustful about
surrendering local authority to

00:22:21.239 --> 00:22:25.028
any kind of a centralized
authority.

00:22:25.028 --> 00:22:28.920
Now in the Continental Army,
obviously this is going to make

00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:32.809
it extremely complicated to
gather together one united armed

00:22:32.809 --> 00:22:33.470
force.
 

00:22:33.470 --> 00:22:36.048
Every state had its own militia.
 

00:22:36.048 --> 00:22:39.935
State legislatures wanted to
stay in control of their own

00:22:39.935 --> 00:22:40.700
militias.
 

00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:44.188
Some of these militias stayed
separate from the Continental

00:22:44.188 --> 00:22:44.608
Army.
 

00:22:44.608 --> 00:22:48.636
They certainly didn't want to
surrender control of their own

00:22:48.636 --> 00:22:52.528
military defense to some kind of
central organization that

00:22:52.528 --> 00:22:56.009
wouldn't necessarily put their
interests first.

00:22:56.009 --> 00:22:59.253
So the very idea of combining
some of these militias into one

00:22:59.253 --> 00:23:01.525
big united one,
in a sense--the Continental

00:23:01.525 --> 00:23:03.038
Army--was controversial.
 

00:23:03.038 --> 00:23:05.480
And at the start of the war in
many ways,

00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:09.267
the army was kind of a
collection of separate little

00:23:09.267 --> 00:23:12.375
military delegations,
just like the Continental

00:23:12.375 --> 00:23:15.346
Congress in some ways was a
collection of separate little

00:23:15.346 --> 00:23:16.460
state delegations.
 

00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:20.058
This same fear about
surrendering local control and

00:23:20.058 --> 00:23:24.595
about protecting local interests
made it extremely difficult for

00:23:24.595 --> 00:23:28.842
the Continental Congress to
organize and orchestrate the war

00:23:28.842 --> 00:23:32.586
effort because as a body the
Continental Congress had

00:23:32.586 --> 00:23:35.609
virtually no power of
enforcement.

00:23:35.609 --> 00:23:37.410
It could advise the states.
 

00:23:37.410 --> 00:23:39.539
It could ask them for things.
 

00:23:39.539 --> 00:23:41.808
It could make recommendations.
 

00:23:41.808 --> 00:23:46.678
It could not order a state to
do something and then enforce

00:23:46.678 --> 00:23:47.769
that order.
 

00:23:47.769 --> 00:23:49.950
It had no real power of
enforcement.

00:23:49.950 --> 00:23:55.159
And this came to be a
particularly big problem when it

00:23:55.159 --> 00:23:58.009
came to supplying the army.
 

00:23:58.009 --> 00:24:02.426
Given that the states didn't
rush forward to supply soldiers

00:24:02.426 --> 00:24:06.500
from other states,
supplying the Continental Army

00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:10.833
in any kind of a reliable way
sometimes was virtually

00:24:10.833 --> 00:24:12.000
impossible.
 

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.313
So whatever the Congress tried
to do in the way of making

00:24:15.313 --> 00:24:18.450
requests or making
recommendations about supplies--

00:24:18.450 --> 00:24:22.199
like we recommend that each
state provide X pounds of food

00:24:22.199 --> 00:24:26.410
and X number of blankets for the
use of the Continental Army--

00:24:26.410 --> 00:24:30.019
you just absolutely couldn't
tell, on the reality level,

00:24:30.019 --> 00:24:35.009
what would happen as a result
of that kind of an order.

00:24:35.009 --> 00:24:38.220
And this was a big problem,
because there was an enormous

00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:41.201
supply shortage in the
Continental Army as well as in

00:24:41.201 --> 00:24:42.519
the local militias.
 

00:24:42.519 --> 00:24:49.200
The scale of supplies required
by this army was huge.

00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:52.480
So for example,
during three months--

00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:59.009
December of 1777 and January
and February of 1778--

00:24:59.009 --> 00:25:02.450
so during a three-month period,
the army ate more than two

00:25:02.450 --> 00:25:05.589
million pounds of beef,
two million pounds of flour,

00:25:05.589 --> 00:25:08.170
and their horses ate two
million tons of hay.

00:25:08.170 --> 00:25:08.601
Okay.
 

00:25:08.601 --> 00:25:13.086
That's a lot of supplies,
particularly if you have no

00:25:13.086 --> 00:25:16.019
really organized way to get it.
 

00:25:16.019 --> 00:25:20.727
And Americans started the war
deficient in almost every

00:25:20.727 --> 00:25:23.691
necessity: guns,
ammunition, flint,

00:25:23.691 --> 00:25:27.702
artillery, steel for bayonets,
clothing, tents,

00:25:27.702 --> 00:25:29.009
blankets.
 

00:25:29.009 --> 00:25:33.483
The solution obviously would be
for the Continental Congress to

00:25:33.483 --> 00:25:37.019
organize some kind of a central
supply system,

00:25:37.019 --> 00:25:38.336
which they tried to do,
but again, without being able

00:25:38.336 --> 00:25:40.770
to enforce things,
that was not a very effective

00:25:40.770 --> 00:25:41.818
way to proceed.
 

00:25:41.818 --> 00:25:44.779
This wasn't all Congress's
fault.

00:25:44.779 --> 00:25:47.259
Congress wasn't very good at
the implementation.

00:25:47.259 --> 00:25:50.380
The actual shortage of
supplies, ironically enough,

00:25:50.380 --> 00:25:54.734
in part, was caused by the fact
that British imports were no

00:25:54.734 --> 00:25:57.776
longer being taken--
right?--in the colonies and the

00:25:57.776 --> 00:26:00.076
states so that we--
the states had been so busy

00:26:00.076 --> 00:26:02.202
saying,
'No, we do not want those evil

00:26:02.202 --> 00:26:03.589
British imported goods.'
 

00:26:03.589 --> 00:26:04.578
Now they're like.
 

00:26:04.578 --> 00:26:07.900
'uh oh, [laughs],
we kind of might have been able

00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:12.119
to use some of that stuff now
that we're actually fighting the

00:26:12.119 --> 00:26:13.019
British.'
 

00:26:13.019 --> 00:26:16.186
So in time they--when the
states began to encourage other

00:26:16.186 --> 00:26:18.278
countries to bring imported
goods,

00:26:18.278 --> 00:26:21.019
this became a little bit less
extreme,

00:26:21.019 --> 00:26:24.751
but that is sort of a weird,
ironic problem that arose when

00:26:24.751 --> 00:26:26.038
the war broke out.
 

00:26:26.038 --> 00:26:28.497
In the meantime,
there were some American

00:26:28.497 --> 00:26:32.000
soldiers fighting with spears,
fighting with tomahawks.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.759
Benjamin Franklin apparently
thought that bows and arrows

00:26:34.759 --> 00:26:37.420
might be a really good idea,
and he was serious--and he

00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:38.160
calculated.
 

00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:40.200
Okay. He's a calculating guy.
 

00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:42.122
You remember he's the guy who
backed away from George

00:26:42.122 --> 00:26:43.380
Whitefield to see how far--Okay.
 

00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:47.582
So he's calculating again,
and he calculated this time

00:26:47.582 --> 00:26:50.434
that you could--
a single soldier could shoot

00:26:50.434 --> 00:26:53.692
off four arrows in the time that
it took him to load and fire his

00:26:53.692 --> 00:26:55.544
gun,
so that maybe it's even a great

00:26:55.544 --> 00:26:58.200
idea to have the soldiers
fighting with bows and arrows.

00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:01.476
That didn't necessarily go very
far but he was thinking about

00:27:01.476 --> 00:27:01.750
it.
 

00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:06.230
As long as the states were so
wary about surrendering control

00:27:06.230 --> 00:27:09.534
to Congress,
supplies really were a

00:27:09.534 --> 00:27:13.009
seemingly insurmountable
problem,

00:27:13.009 --> 00:27:16.166
and there are actually stories
of Washington's aides literally

00:27:16.166 --> 00:27:19.428
going farmhouse to farmhouse and
knocking on doors to ask people

00:27:19.428 --> 00:27:22.481
for blankets and supplies and
wagons and whatever they could

00:27:22.481 --> 00:27:23.000
get.
 

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:26.558
Literally, the army sometimes
was reduced to that level.

00:27:26.558 --> 00:27:31.344
Given that kind of problem,
it makes sense that the

00:27:31.344 --> 00:27:37.277
experience of fighting the war
convinced many people that there

00:27:37.277 --> 00:27:41.009
did need to be something
stronger,

00:27:41.009 --> 00:27:45.092
something more centralized at
the center of whatever kind of

00:27:45.092 --> 00:27:47.029
confederation was forming.
 

00:27:47.029 --> 00:27:48.575
And particularly people who
were at military headquarters

00:27:48.575 --> 00:27:50.530
with Washington,
which includes Alexander

00:27:50.530 --> 00:27:53.990
Hamilton, since they were the
guys who were seeing problems

00:27:53.990 --> 00:27:57.451
with supplies and how Congress
couldn't seem to do anything

00:27:57.451 --> 00:28:00.894
forcefully and efficiently--
it's not surprising that many

00:28:00.894 --> 00:28:03.945
of those people ended up being
really strong nationalists who

00:28:03.945 --> 00:28:06.538
really wanted a stronger
centralized government.

00:28:06.538 --> 00:28:09.720
Hamilton, frustrated at
headquarters,

00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:12.490
just seeing what he saw as this
sort of amazing,

00:28:12.490 --> 00:28:19.019
potentially deadly inefficiency
of the Continental Congress,

00:28:19.019 --> 00:28:20.335
really early in the war,
he is already coming forward

00:28:20.335 --> 00:28:23.405
and saying,
'We need a stronger centralized

00:28:23.405 --> 00:28:25.433
power;
we need a stronger centralized

00:28:25.433 --> 00:28:28.261
power,' even before anyone is
really thinking about what kind

00:28:28.261 --> 00:28:29.630
of government comes later.
 

00:28:29.630 --> 00:28:31.660
Hamilton's sort of already out
there pounding away,

00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:35.489
and it's partly based on his
real life experience of what

00:28:35.489 --> 00:28:39.659
it's like to try and be governed
by the Continental Army while

00:28:39.659 --> 00:28:42.598
being in the army during a time
of war.

00:28:42.598 --> 00:28:46.519
So this is basically an
interesting and important point.

00:28:46.519 --> 00:28:51.038
It'll come up again towards the
end of the course,

00:28:51.038 --> 00:28:54.526
but basically there were real
life experiences behind people's

00:28:54.526 --> 00:28:57.669
theoretical ideas about what
kind of government would be

00:28:57.669 --> 00:29:00.068
desirable for the new American
nation.

00:29:00.068 --> 00:29:03.375
When we get to the part of the
course where we're talking about

00:29:03.375 --> 00:29:06.681
the Constitution and different
ideas and sort of what led up to

00:29:06.681 --> 00:29:10.200
it and why people thought one
thing or thought another thing,

00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:13.788
some of those ideas are not
sort of highfalutin',

00:29:13.788 --> 00:29:16.678
sort of detached 'thoughts
about federalism,' but they're

00:29:16.678 --> 00:29:19.721
actually based on real life
experiences and real lessons and

00:29:19.721 --> 00:29:22.662
people looking at what has been
happening and then drawing

00:29:22.662 --> 00:29:25.500
conclusions and coming to
different conclusions--

00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:27.897
but still, drawing conclusions,
based on what they've just

00:29:27.897 --> 00:29:31.087
experienced,
about what should be happening

00:29:31.087 --> 00:29:31.598
next.
 

00:29:31.598 --> 00:29:32.044
Okay.
 

00:29:32.044 --> 00:29:35.334
So basically centralized
coordination,

00:29:35.334 --> 00:29:40.403
scary thing for the states--not
good news for organizing a

00:29:40.403 --> 00:29:44.724
continental army;
neither was the complete lack

00:29:44.724 --> 00:29:49.538
of a precedent for what the
Congress was doing in organizing

00:29:49.538 --> 00:29:51.932
this war--
if you think about Great

00:29:51.932 --> 00:29:55.205
Britain, think about all of the
sophisticated administrative

00:29:55.205 --> 00:29:58.868
machinery that they would have
had there for conducting a war,

00:29:58.868 --> 00:30:02.207
and then think about the
American states that have really

00:30:02.207 --> 00:30:03.338
nothing in place.
 

00:30:03.338 --> 00:30:07.000
They're really starting from
scratch,

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:11.184
and the people in Congress who
were responsible for organizing

00:30:11.184 --> 00:30:14.890
the army were not men with vast
military experience.

00:30:14.890 --> 00:30:19.011
Of the roughly sixty-five
congressmen that were in

00:30:19.011 --> 00:30:23.763
attendance in 1775 and 1776,
only five had served with the

00:30:23.763 --> 00:30:26.868
British during the French and
Indian War;

00:30:26.868 --> 00:30:32.891
only one of these five had real
experience in supplies and that

00:30:32.891 --> 00:30:37.925
experience dated back to 1759;
none really had experience with

00:30:37.925 --> 00:30:40.038
medical matters in a time of
war;

00:30:40.038 --> 00:30:43.086
only two had any medical
training and they were not on

00:30:43.086 --> 00:30:46.134
the medical committee,
so bureaucracy even at an early

00:30:46.134 --> 00:30:46.710
point.
 

00:30:46.710 --> 00:30:48.405
[laughs]
'Let's take the two medical

00:30:48.405 --> 00:30:50.539
guys and put them on the grain
committee.'

00:30:50.539 --> 00:30:53.420
Well, I don't know.
 

00:30:53.420 --> 00:30:56.715
So basically,
you have a bunch of people here

00:30:56.715 --> 00:31:00.912
who are trying to figure out
from scratch how to create a

00:31:00.912 --> 00:31:03.009
coordinated army effort.
 

00:31:03.009 --> 00:31:06.884
By 1778, Congress began to try
to improve its administrative

00:31:06.884 --> 00:31:10.826
structure and it did begin to
create boards of war and boards

00:31:10.826 --> 00:31:13.323
of admiralty,
but even once they started to

00:31:13.323 --> 00:31:15.180
have an organized administrative
force,

00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:19.140
habits of individual
congressmen were unpredictable.

00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:22.368
There wasn't even a way to
enforce attendance to the

00:31:22.368 --> 00:31:25.009
Continental Congress--
and again, sometimes

00:31:25.009 --> 00:31:28.478
Continental Congressmen thought
that what was happening at home

00:31:28.478 --> 00:31:31.835
demanded their attention more
than whatever was going on with

00:31:31.835 --> 00:31:36.173
the Continental Congress,
so they just didn't show up--to

00:31:36.173 --> 00:31:40.766
the point that in April of 1778,
Congress actually circulated a

00:31:40.766 --> 00:31:43.776
written statement that was
titled "Engagement of

00:31:43.776 --> 00:31:45.858
Members to Meet
Punctually."

00:31:45.858 --> 00:31:46.230
Okay.
 

00:31:46.230 --> 00:31:49.797
They actually published a
little reminder saying:

00:31:49.797 --> 00:31:52.769
'we really need you guys to
come [laughs]

00:31:52.769 --> 00:31:54.328
to the Congress.
 

00:31:54.328 --> 00:31:56.779
We're kind of having a war and
bad things are happening.

00:31:56.779 --> 00:31:59.400
We really--We'd like you to be
here so you can actually do

00:31:59.400 --> 00:31:59.858
things.'
 

00:31:59.858 --> 00:32:02.654
Even just attendance sometimes
could be a problem,

00:32:02.654 --> 00:32:05.278
and that really didn't
accomplish very much.

00:32:05.278 --> 00:32:08.170
As one historian wrote,
Congress was "too

00:32:08.170 --> 00:32:11.509
inefficient to correct its own
inefficiency."

00:32:11.509 --> 00:32:14.410
That's not good.
 

00:32:14.410 --> 00:32:14.771
Okay.
 

00:32:14.771 --> 00:32:18.318
So obviously things are
somewhat unpredictable,

00:32:18.318 --> 00:32:22.247
occasionally random,
and this made congressional

00:32:22.247 --> 00:32:27.009
control and organization a
problem throughout the war--

00:32:27.009 --> 00:32:31.028
and it wasn't just congressmen
who were inexperienced with this

00:32:31.028 --> 00:32:34.981
kind of issue and were having
problems with the whole question

00:32:34.981 --> 00:32:36.019
of supplies.
 

00:32:36.019 --> 00:32:40.009
Supply issues were complicated
by the behavior of soldiers,

00:32:40.009 --> 00:32:42.240
many of whom for the most part
had not ever been soldiers

00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:44.307
before,
so they're also not following

00:32:44.307 --> 00:32:45.170
any precedent.
 

00:32:45.170 --> 00:32:49.009
It's not like they're a trained
military force--

00:32:49.009 --> 00:32:51.865
and many of them were often far
more interested in protecting

00:32:51.865 --> 00:32:53.769
their locality than in anything
else,

00:32:53.769 --> 00:32:58.303
and their behavior in battle
when far from home was sometimes

00:32:58.303 --> 00:32:59.210
not ideal.
 

00:32:59.210 --> 00:33:02.444
Also, because they were not
always sure of what they were

00:33:02.444 --> 00:33:06.142
doing they were not very careful
with the supplies that they were

00:33:06.142 --> 00:33:06.720
given.
 

00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:09.297
Like the riflemen.,
they fired off their guns for

00:33:09.297 --> 00:33:09.618
fun.
 

00:33:09.618 --> 00:33:14.729
They sold sometimes their
clothes and ammunition if they

00:33:14.729 --> 00:33:16.028
needed cash.
 

00:33:16.028 --> 00:33:19.382
When they were beating a hasty
retreat, they tended to just

00:33:19.382 --> 00:33:22.849
throw anything that was heavy
and getting in their way on the

00:33:22.849 --> 00:33:24.180
ground as they ran.
 

00:33:24.180 --> 00:33:30.058
One soldier who returned to a
place where the army--

00:33:30.058 --> 00:33:32.643
the Continental Army had just
retreated said "the ground

00:33:32.643 --> 00:33:35.686
was literally covered with arms,
knapsacks, staves,

00:33:35.686 --> 00:33:39.019
coats, hats,
and old oil flasks."

00:33:39.019 --> 00:33:41.147
These people--They just dropped
things and ran,

00:33:41.147 --> 00:33:42.490
and left them on the field.
 

00:33:42.490 --> 00:33:46.049
So there's no precedent on so
many levels for what we're

00:33:46.049 --> 00:33:47.410
talking about here.
 

00:33:47.410 --> 00:33:52.029
There was no precedent for an
organized Continental Army,

00:33:52.029 --> 00:33:54.576
there was no precedent for an
organized Continental Army

00:33:54.576 --> 00:33:57.493
administration,
so troops had to learn how to

00:33:57.493 --> 00:34:01.160
behave like an army while
already fighting a war--

00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:07.009
which leads to another problem
at the start of the war,

00:34:07.009 --> 00:34:11.045
and that is the problem of what
certainly one or two European

00:34:11.045 --> 00:34:14.679
visitors saw as the attitude of
the American troops.

00:34:14.679 --> 00:34:17.643
In part, as I just suggested,
many soldiers were just

00:34:17.643 --> 00:34:20.608
ignorant about military
operations, about how an army

00:34:20.608 --> 00:34:22.489
was supposed to be organized.
 

00:34:22.489 --> 00:34:23.710
They hadn't been soldiers.
 

00:34:23.710 --> 00:34:25.900
They didn't know how an army
was supposed to work.

00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:29.280
They had to be trained from
scratch.

00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:35.422
Now Baron von Steuben was a
foreign volunteer that arrived

00:34:35.422 --> 00:34:38.010
in the states in 1777.
 

00:34:38.010 --> 00:34:40.347
Specifically,
he was given the task of

00:34:40.347 --> 00:34:42.369
training the Continental Army.
 

00:34:42.369 --> 00:34:45.768
He was someone who had
experience with European armies.

00:34:45.768 --> 00:34:49.000
He was given the task of
training the American troops.

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:52.530
Steuben didn't speak a lot of
English when he first came here.

00:34:52.530 --> 00:34:54.260
He actually was much better in
French and German,

00:34:54.260 --> 00:34:58.059
and so according to people at
the time,

00:34:58.059 --> 00:35:00.003
when he was training the
troops, he cursed in three

00:35:00.003 --> 00:35:01.559
different languages at the same
time,

00:35:01.559 --> 00:35:03.190
[laughs]
English, French and German,

00:35:03.190 --> 00:35:04.300
and I guess he cursed a lot.
 

00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:07.239
I think he was probably a
little surprised by what the

00:35:07.239 --> 00:35:08.460
troops could not do.
 

00:35:08.460 --> 00:35:11.920
Supposedly, Steuben and others
who were trying to train the

00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:15.501
troops discovered among other
things that it was very hard to

00:35:15.501 --> 00:35:18.545
teach the people to march
because they didn't always

00:35:18.545 --> 00:35:21.469
consistently know left foot and
right foot.

00:35:21.469 --> 00:35:21.652
Right?
 

00:35:21.652 --> 00:35:23.199
If that's something you hadn't
thought about before,

00:35:23.199 --> 00:35:25.018
I suppose you're not thinking
about it as you're walking.

00:35:25.018 --> 00:35:27.601
So--And I'm such a city slicker
here that I don't know the

00:35:27.601 --> 00:35:29.958
difference, and I always--every
year when I say this,

00:35:29.958 --> 00:35:31.590
I count on someone in the
class.

00:35:31.590 --> 00:35:34.036
Maybe one of you will know and
can sort of interpret this for

00:35:34.036 --> 00:35:34.239
me.
 

00:35:34.239 --> 00:35:37.989
Supposedly, or at least
anecdotally,

00:35:37.989 --> 00:35:41.755
one of the things that they did
to train these troops was they

00:35:41.755 --> 00:35:45.518
tied hay on one foot and straw
on the other foot and said,

00:35:45.518 --> 00:35:47.972
'hay foot, straw foot,
hay foot, straw foot,' and that

00:35:47.972 --> 00:35:50.610
was the way that people were
initially taught to march.

00:35:50.610 --> 00:35:54.137
Now of course city slicker me:
What is the difference between

00:35:54.137 --> 00:35:55.079
hay and straw?
 

00:35:55.079 --> 00:35:56.840
[laughter] I would be bad.
 

00:35:56.840 --> 00:35:58.420
I would be even worse.
 

00:35:58.420 --> 00:36:00.750
I would be not knowing how to
march in the Continental Army

00:36:00.750 --> 00:36:02.679
because I wouldn't know which
was my hay foot.

00:36:02.679 --> 00:36:05.134
Does anyone here know the
difference between hay and

00:36:05.134 --> 00:36:05.519
straw?
 

00:36:05.519 --> 00:36:06.780
Oh, yes.
 

00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:07.800
Student: I'm a farm kid.
 

00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:12.639
Straw is just--It's pretty much
just like the stem of the wheat.

00:36:12.639 --> 00:36:16.820
It's all pretty much throwaway
stuff used for bedding.

00:36:16.820 --> 00:36:20.550
Hay actually has grass and
alfalfa--food for animals in it.

00:36:20.550 --> 00:36:21.923
Prof: Okay.
 

00:36:21.923 --> 00:36:26.199
So straw is the--just the stem
of the wheat and hay --

00:36:26.199 --> 00:36:27.820
Student: Straw is all
throwaway stuff.

00:36:27.820 --> 00:36:29.518
Hay has actual food mixed in
with it.

00:36:29.518 --> 00:36:30.760
Prof: Hay has actual
food mixed in.

00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:32.170
Thank you very much.
 

00:36:32.170 --> 00:36:34.847
I knew there had to be [laughs]
someone who knows something

00:36:34.847 --> 00:36:35.539
about a farm.
 

00:36:35.539 --> 00:36:36.260
Thank you very much.
 

00:36:36.260 --> 00:36:37.630
I greatly appreciate that.
 

00:36:37.630 --> 00:36:37.856
Okay.
 

00:36:37.856 --> 00:36:40.260
I'm writing it down for next
time I talk about this.

00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:40.780
Okay.
 

00:36:40.780 --> 00:36:43.699
I have it written down now.
 

00:36:43.699 --> 00:36:46.219
I have my fact for the day that
I learned.

00:36:46.219 --> 00:36:48.090
Thank you very much.
 

00:36:48.090 --> 00:36:51.478
Now von Steuben is one of the
people who looked at the

00:36:51.478 --> 00:36:54.994
Continental soldiers and
commented on what he took to be

00:36:54.994 --> 00:36:57.360
a particularly American
attitude.

00:36:57.360 --> 00:36:59.469
Supposedly, what Steuben said
was,

00:36:59.469 --> 00:37:02.840
in the Prussian army,
officers said to a soldier

00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:07.289
"'Do this,' and he doeth
it: but I am obliged to say...

00:37:07.289 --> 00:37:09.219
'This is the reason why you
ought to do that;'

00:37:09.219 --> 00:37:10.929
and then he does it."
 

00:37:10.929 --> 00:37:14.445
The Americans are operating in
a slightly different way from

00:37:14.445 --> 00:37:17.960
what he considers a traditional
European army's behavior.

00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:21.349
Basically, Americans didn't
always respond well to orders.

00:37:21.349 --> 00:37:22.880
They wanted to take part in
decisions.

00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:25.630
They wanted their opinions to
be represented.

00:37:25.630 --> 00:37:28.201
Obviously, this kind of
political sensibility could

00:37:28.201 --> 00:37:30.927
present problems if you're
trying to command men in an

00:37:30.927 --> 00:37:31.389
army.
 

00:37:31.389 --> 00:37:36.030
It also created problems with
terms of enlistment.

00:37:36.030 --> 00:37:40.416
Soldiers tended to sign on for
one year at a time and when the

00:37:40.416 --> 00:37:43.510
year was over,
they just often went home.

00:37:43.510 --> 00:37:47.242
They were in the army by
choice, and they felt that they

00:37:47.242 --> 00:37:51.313
basically had no need to listen
to any kind of higher command

00:37:51.313 --> 00:37:53.010
telling them to stay.
 

00:37:53.010 --> 00:37:55.117
We'll see a little bit later in
a future lecture Washington

00:37:55.117 --> 00:37:57.190
literally pleading with the men:
'Please don't go home.

00:37:57.190 --> 00:37:58.190
I know you can go home.
 

00:37:58.190 --> 00:37:59.570
Please don't go home.
 

00:37:59.570 --> 00:38:01.659
Please stay just a little bit
longer.'

00:38:01.659 --> 00:38:05.090
So for example,
at the end of 1775,

00:38:05.090 --> 00:38:08.969
a big chunk of the army just
packed up and went home--

00:38:08.969 --> 00:38:13.050
so America essentially changed
armies at the beginning of 1776,

00:38:13.050 --> 00:38:15.619
found new men,
enlisted them for another

00:38:15.619 --> 00:38:18.952
one-year term,
and it was assumed that at the

00:38:18.952 --> 00:38:23.010
end of another year the same
thing would happen again.

00:38:23.010 --> 00:38:25.257
It took a while before Congress
agreed to try and regulate and

00:38:25.257 --> 00:38:26.400
lengthen terms of enlistment.
 

00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:31.112
There was a similar problem
involved with social rank and

00:38:31.112 --> 00:38:32.460
military rank.
 

00:38:32.460 --> 00:38:35.887
I've already mentioned very
early in the course that social

00:38:35.887 --> 00:38:38.318
rank,
hierarchy in the colonies,

00:38:38.318 --> 00:38:42.010
was a little bit more slippery
than in England,

00:38:42.010 --> 00:38:44.286
so that while there certainly
was an elite in the colonies and

00:38:44.286 --> 00:38:46.135
the states,
there wasn't a sort of

00:38:46.135 --> 00:38:49.150
entrenched to-the-manor-born
aristocratic class,

00:38:49.150 --> 00:38:51.550
as there would have been in
England,

00:38:51.550 --> 00:38:55.648
and the difference between a
gentleman and a more common man

00:38:55.648 --> 00:38:58.010
could sometimes be hard to tell.
 

00:38:58.010 --> 00:39:01.434
Well, Washington wanted
gentlemen to serve as commanding

00:39:01.434 --> 00:39:02.119
officers.
 

00:39:02.119 --> 00:39:08.173
Basically, he wanted to use
social rank to enforce military

00:39:08.173 --> 00:39:10.489
rank,
thinking that if you respected

00:39:10.489 --> 00:39:13.447
someone as your social superior
you'd probably respect him as

00:39:13.447 --> 00:39:14.730
your military superior.
 

00:39:14.730 --> 00:39:17.378
As Washington put it,
"the true criterion"

00:39:17.378 --> 00:39:20.336
of judgment about who should be
an officer "when past

00:39:20.336 --> 00:39:22.829
services do not enter into the
competition,

00:39:22.829 --> 00:39:25.907
is, whether the candidate for
office has a just pretension to

00:39:25.907 --> 00:39:28.949
the character of a gentleman,
a proper sense of honor,

00:39:28.949 --> 00:39:30.989
and some reputation to
lose."

00:39:30.989 --> 00:39:31.271
Right?
 

00:39:31.271 --> 00:39:34.039
If he has some reputation to
lose, he's going to worry about

00:39:34.039 --> 00:39:36.619
losing it, so there's a logic
for having an officer.

00:39:36.619 --> 00:39:41.010
Now this may sound logical by
eighteenth-century terms--

00:39:41.010 --> 00:39:43.909
this kind of logic--but it
often presented a problem,

00:39:43.909 --> 00:39:46.943
because sometimes there really
wasn't all that much separating

00:39:46.943 --> 00:39:49.202
socially--
as far as rank is

00:39:49.202 --> 00:39:53.018
concerned--officers from
non-officers.

00:39:53.018 --> 00:39:54.679
And again, think about the New
Englanders promoting people from

00:39:54.679 --> 00:39:55.190
within their own.
 

00:39:55.190 --> 00:39:58.023
Sometimes there wasn't really
much of a social rank

00:39:58.023 --> 00:39:59.949
differentiating officers at all.
 

00:39:59.949 --> 00:40:02.731
There's one historian who
argues that one of the reasons

00:40:02.731 --> 00:40:05.565
why there was dueling prevalent
among some of the younger

00:40:05.565 --> 00:40:08.702
officers in the Continental Army
was because they were actually

00:40:08.702 --> 00:40:10.980
dueling to prove that they could
duel,

00:40:10.980 --> 00:40:14.018
which meant that they were
actually gentlemen,

00:40:14.018 --> 00:40:16.795
or of the gentleman class,
which meant they were actually

00:40:16.795 --> 00:40:19.918
better than some of the men they
were commanding who were pretty

00:40:19.918 --> 00:40:21.010
much their equals.
 

00:40:21.010 --> 00:40:22.710
So dueling was a way for these
young officers to sort of prove

00:40:22.710 --> 00:40:23.630
that they deserved to be elite.
 

00:40:23.630 --> 00:40:27.213
So we're talking about kind of
a fuzzy line here that was not

00:40:27.213 --> 00:40:30.559
helpful for Washington in trying
to figure out how to get

00:40:30.559 --> 00:40:32.768
discipline and order in the
army.

00:40:32.768 --> 00:40:36.739
This is certainly not something
that you would have found in the

00:40:36.739 --> 00:40:40.329
British or French army where
social rank and military rank

00:40:40.329 --> 00:40:43.039
was much more defined and
established,

00:40:43.039 --> 00:40:46.652
and it's one of the reasons why
Europeans came to America to

00:40:46.652 --> 00:40:49.039
fight during the American
Revolution.

00:40:49.039 --> 00:40:52.250
Some of them came because they
were inspired by the cause.

00:40:52.250 --> 00:40:55.385
Some of them came because they
would not have been able to

00:40:55.385 --> 00:40:58.409
promote themselves in the
British or French Army or some

00:40:58.409 --> 00:41:00.628
other army,
but in the Continental Army

00:41:00.628 --> 00:41:02.809
they were Europeans;
they seemed sophisticated;

00:41:02.809 --> 00:41:04.289
they seemed to have experience.
 

00:41:04.289 --> 00:41:06.005
They could go to the
Continental Army,

00:41:06.005 --> 00:41:08.744
say that they would fight for
the cause if they were given a

00:41:08.744 --> 00:41:11.250
commission as an officer,
and they'd be given one.

00:41:11.250 --> 00:41:14.300
And this was enormously
demoralizing for some of the

00:41:14.300 --> 00:41:17.650
Continental Army officers who
were not being promoted.

00:41:17.650 --> 00:41:20.246
They watched these people come
in from other countries and be

00:41:20.246 --> 00:41:21.199
promoted above them.
 

00:41:21.199 --> 00:41:24.094
Alexander Hamilton said it gave
him "pygmy feelings,"

00:41:24.094 --> 00:41:26.990
this idea that these foreigners
could come in because they were

00:41:26.990 --> 00:41:29.840
supposedly better than us and
then get promoted over us,

00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:34.331
and we were just a bunch of
rustic boobs and we didn't get

00:41:34.331 --> 00:41:37.010
promoted as quickly as they did.
 

00:41:37.010 --> 00:41:39.688
So some people from foreign
countries were actually taking

00:41:39.688 --> 00:41:42.226
advantage of the sort of
ambiguity in the states at the

00:41:42.226 --> 00:41:42.650
time.
 

00:41:42.650 --> 00:41:42.998
Okay.
 

00:41:42.998 --> 00:41:46.130
So looking at the process of
organizing a war,

00:41:46.130 --> 00:41:49.748
we've seen regionalism and
localism in action working

00:41:49.748 --> 00:41:53.230
against centralized control and
organization;

00:41:53.230 --> 00:41:56.773
we've seen complications of
social rank and the sort of

00:41:56.773 --> 00:42:00.119
individualism of the troops,
making it hard again to

00:42:00.119 --> 00:42:03.148
organize and command;
and overall we've seen a

00:42:03.148 --> 00:42:06.389
Congress that all in all doesn't
have that much power,

00:42:06.389 --> 00:42:11.724
really struggling to exert some
kind of centralized control over

00:42:11.724 --> 00:42:14.010
a continental war effort.
 

00:42:14.010 --> 00:42:16.119
So in essence,
the things that were

00:42:16.119 --> 00:42:19.965
complicating unity between the
colonies and then the states are

00:42:19.965 --> 00:42:23.501
the same things logically that
are going to complicate and

00:42:23.501 --> 00:42:27.719
confuse efforts to create some
kind of continental war effort.

00:42:27.719 --> 00:42:31.820
We'll see this continuing in a
different way in the 1780s.

00:42:31.820 --> 00:42:34.786
Now we've been looking at--I
want to just take a few minutes

00:42:34.786 --> 00:42:35.139
here.
 

00:42:35.139 --> 00:42:37.885
We've been looking at some of
the realities of the Continental

00:42:37.885 --> 00:42:38.199
Army.
 

00:42:38.199 --> 00:42:41.869
I brought in a handout partly
because I'm very low tech so I

00:42:41.869 --> 00:42:45.632
didn't bring a computer--
but partly because I actually

00:42:45.632 --> 00:42:49.010
really wanted you to hold this
in your hands,

00:42:49.010 --> 00:42:50.951
and while it's being passed out
I'll talk about what it is

00:42:50.951 --> 00:42:52.110
before you get your hands on it.
 

00:42:52.110 --> 00:42:56.811
It's actually a newspaper,
a Connecticut newspaper from

00:42:56.811 --> 00:42:58.030
July 8,1776.
 

00:42:58.030 --> 00:43:02.010
It's the entire newspaper,
as you will see.

00:43:02.010 --> 00:43:03.983
It's a little bit smaller than
it would have been but not

00:43:03.983 --> 00:43:05.639
tremendously smaller than it
would have been.

00:43:05.639 --> 00:43:08.599
But as you'll see,
it's called The Weekly

00:43:08.599 --> 00:43:10.869
so it came out once a week.
 

00:43:10.869 --> 00:43:12.809
It is four pages long.
 

00:43:12.809 --> 00:43:14.760
I'll wait as it sort of gets
passed out here.

00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:19.730
This particular one is The
Connecticut Courant.

00:43:19.730 --> 00:43:26.028
It was printed in Hartford
and as I mentioned the date:

00:43:26.028 --> 00:43:27.550
July 8,1776.
 

00:43:27.550 --> 00:43:31.132
So as you're getting it
you--you'll notice--you look at

00:43:31.132 --> 00:43:32.260
the front page.
 

00:43:32.260 --> 00:43:34.969
Let me get my copy here.
 

00:43:34.969 --> 00:43:38.554
You can see that it contains
"the freshest advices,

00:43:38.554 --> 00:43:40.769
both foreign and
domestic."

00:43:40.769 --> 00:43:44.090
Okay. News, fresh news.
 

00:43:44.090 --> 00:43:46.682
And one of the first things
that you'll see on the front

00:43:46.682 --> 00:43:49.465
page in the left-hand column is
"persons that are being

00:43:49.465 --> 00:43:52.389
held up to public view as
enemies to their country"--

00:43:52.389 --> 00:43:54.309
right off the cuff.
 

00:43:54.309 --> 00:43:58.213
These are probably people who
maybe were treating with

00:43:58.213 --> 00:44:02.632
Loyalists or supplying the enemy
army or denouncing the local

00:44:02.632 --> 00:44:03.590
congress.
 

00:44:03.590 --> 00:44:06.675
Who knows what they were doing,
but whatever they were doing it

00:44:06.675 --> 00:44:09.315
was bad and they're being
publicly shamed on the front

00:44:09.315 --> 00:44:10.659
page of this newspaper.
 

00:44:10.659 --> 00:44:12.972
And it suggests--It says
"confession one

00:44:12.972 --> 00:44:15.181
dollar,"
which suggests that you could

00:44:15.181 --> 00:44:18.389
step forward and confess and
apologize and pay a dollar--

00:44:18.389 --> 00:44:20.789
sort of, 'okay,
I won't do it again.'

00:44:20.789 --> 00:44:23.389
I can't say I've seen any
confession,

00:44:23.389 --> 00:44:26.090
but certainly many,
many issues of this paper when

00:44:26.090 --> 00:44:29.231
I was looking through them
contained that column with more

00:44:29.231 --> 00:44:31.050
people being publicly shamed.
 

00:44:31.050 --> 00:44:31.356
Okay.
 

00:44:31.356 --> 00:44:34.722
So if you look at the paper,
you could see right off the

00:44:34.722 --> 00:44:38.271
cuff you have something being
reprinted from a Pennsylvania

00:44:38.271 --> 00:44:39.190
newspaper.
 

00:44:39.190 --> 00:44:43.018
It actually is a declaration.
 

00:44:43.018 --> 00:44:48.010
Someone's ranting about the
British and then goes on to say,

00:44:48.010 --> 00:44:50.768
'Why doesn't the Continental
Congress reward any British

00:44:50.768 --> 00:44:53.980
officer who deserts the British
army by giving him land here?'

00:44:53.980 --> 00:44:54.646
What a great idea.
 

00:44:54.646 --> 00:44:56.688
We'll get them to desert by
promising them land and then

00:44:56.688 --> 00:44:58.920
they'll come over to our side--
and you can see they have

00:44:58.920 --> 00:45:00.940
different amounts of acres that
they're proposing,

00:45:00.940 --> 00:45:02.500
so it's like a little plan.
 

00:45:02.500 --> 00:45:04.903
I can't say it goes anywhere
but it is an interesting little

00:45:04.903 --> 00:45:05.190
plan.
 

00:45:05.190 --> 00:45:09.480
You can see next that there's
news from London dated March 21.

00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:09.791
Okay.
 

00:45:09.791 --> 00:45:12.480
We're July 8,
so there are several things in

00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:15.918
this paper that are a reminder
of how slow news traveled

00:45:15.918 --> 00:45:20.170
particularly from overseas back
to the states and the colonies.

00:45:20.170 --> 00:45:24.242
This is actually a debate in
Parliament about the death of an

00:45:24.242 --> 00:45:26.911
American general,
General Montgomery,

00:45:26.911 --> 00:45:30.500
which moves in to being a
debate about the rebels,

00:45:30.500 --> 00:45:32.827
and you can see capital
letters, "rebel,"

00:45:32.827 --> 00:45:34.690
"rebel,"
"rebellion,"

00:45:34.690 --> 00:45:36.320
sort of throughout that column.
 

00:45:36.320 --> 00:45:38.059
Then we've got news from
Williamsburg.

00:45:38.059 --> 00:45:40.949
On the bottom there on the
third column,

00:45:40.949 --> 00:45:43.699
we've got a couple little
advertisements for a political

00:45:43.699 --> 00:45:45.849
pamphlet and cash needed for old
cloths--

00:45:45.849 --> 00:45:48.786
basically, so the printing
press folk can clean off the

00:45:48.786 --> 00:45:49.329
presses.
 

00:45:49.329 --> 00:45:53.177
One of the things you'll notice
is that it's sort of random news

00:45:53.177 --> 00:45:55.500
often printed from other
newspapers.

00:45:55.500 --> 00:45:59.460
There on the top of the second
page from North Carolina,

00:45:59.460 --> 00:46:03.527
you actually could see that
North Carolina is instructing

00:46:03.527 --> 00:46:08.175
its delegates in the Continental
Congress that they would be able

00:46:08.175 --> 00:46:10.210
to declare independence.
 

00:46:10.210 --> 00:46:12.559
There's kind of a major
statement, "boom,"

00:46:12.559 --> 00:46:13.940
right there,
sort of by itself,

00:46:13.940 --> 00:46:14.768
no commentary.
 

00:46:14.768 --> 00:46:17.655
You can see one thing
actually--We're running out of

00:46:17.655 --> 00:46:21.052
time, but one of the things you
will not see--July 8,1776--is

00:46:21.052 --> 00:46:23.090
the Declaration of Independence.
 

00:46:23.090 --> 00:46:26.309
It has not gotten here yet in
time to be printed,

00:46:26.309 --> 00:46:28.780
and it's actually not until the
next edition,

00:46:28.780 --> 00:46:32.360
on the 15^(th) of July that you
see the Declaration of

00:46:32.360 --> 00:46:36.010
Independence actually get
printed in this newspaper.

00:46:36.010 --> 00:46:37.097
No commentary,
just sort of like that little

00:46:37.097 --> 00:46:38.335
North Carolina declaration,
just "boom,"

00:46:38.335 --> 00:46:39.119
they just sort of print it.
 

00:46:39.119 --> 00:46:42.860
It takes up about two columns,
and that's it.

00:46:42.860 --> 00:46:46.181
This paper is typical of many
in that it would start out

00:46:46.181 --> 00:46:48.735
having typically,
I suppose--This one has it

00:46:48.735 --> 00:46:51.632
mixed, but sometimes you have
international news and then

00:46:51.632 --> 00:46:54.684
national news and then local
news and then on the back you'd

00:46:54.684 --> 00:46:58.132
have advertisements,
and in a general way this paper

00:46:58.132 --> 00:47:00.369
is kind of following that trend.
 

00:47:00.369 --> 00:47:06.010
Let's see if there's anything
else I want to point out.

00:47:06.010 --> 00:47:09.505
You'll see on the third page
we've got news from Hartford,

00:47:09.505 --> 00:47:12.018
so it's become local by the
third page.

00:47:12.018 --> 00:47:15.481
You'll see on the third column
there "deserted from

00:47:15.481 --> 00:47:17.621
Colonel John Ward's
regiment,"

00:47:17.621 --> 00:47:19.949
one Tillson Mills it looks
like--

00:47:19.949 --> 00:47:21.510
Miller--I'm sorry--a drummer.
 

00:47:21.510 --> 00:47:23.728
He is about 30 years old,
5 foot 6 inches high,

00:47:23.728 --> 00:47:26.045
has a peaked chin "and
something of a guilty

00:47:26.045 --> 00:47:26.768
look."
 

00:47:26.768 --> 00:47:29.369
[laughter]
I love that description.

00:47:29.369 --> 00:47:32.820
You'll see that throughout this
column and the last page there

00:47:32.820 --> 00:47:35.987
are a couple listings about
deserters, people looking for

00:47:35.987 --> 00:47:36.780
deserters.
 

00:47:36.780 --> 00:47:41.489
You'll see someone--Where is he?
 

00:47:41.489 --> 00:47:44.980
Well, maybe he's on the third
page.

00:47:44.980 --> 00:47:48.925
Roger--On the third column on
the third page,

00:47:48.925 --> 00:47:53.768
Roger March of Litchfield
opposed and spoke against the

00:47:53.768 --> 00:47:56.010
measures of Congress.
 

00:47:56.010 --> 00:47:58.842
He's probably going to be enemy
to our country in the first

00:47:58.842 --> 00:48:02.018
column of the first page in the
next edition of this newspaper.

00:48:02.018 --> 00:48:04.344
So basically I--I'm--I've
handed this to you just so that

00:48:04.344 --> 00:48:06.793
you could get a sense of what a
typical newspaper would have

00:48:06.793 --> 00:48:09.434
looked like--
what you would have seen if you

00:48:09.434 --> 00:48:12.969
were in Hartford,
Connecticut, on July 8,1776.

00:48:12.969 --> 00:48:15.353
This would have been what was
at your disposal for whatever

00:48:15.353 --> 00:48:17.724
was happening in Connecticut,
for whatever was happening

00:48:17.724 --> 00:48:20.186
throughout the states,
for whatever was happening

00:48:20.186 --> 00:48:20.760
overseas.
 

00:48:20.760 --> 00:48:23.059
Some of that overseas news goes
back to March.

00:48:23.059 --> 00:48:26.427
But this is how people are
learning about whatever is

00:48:26.427 --> 00:48:28.889
happening in that entire war
effort.

00:48:28.889 --> 00:48:30.809
It's haphazard,
it's kind of random,

00:48:30.809 --> 00:48:34.010
it's slow, and it's often
unreliable--

00:48:34.010 --> 00:48:37.634
so again it's kind of a
dramatic reminder about some of

00:48:37.634 --> 00:48:41.324
the realities of engaging in a
war in a period when even

00:48:41.324 --> 00:48:44.480
communication is complicated and
difficult.

00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:46.559
I will stop there because we
are out of time.

00:48:46.559 --> 00:48:51.530
On Thursday will be the midterm
here.

00:48:51.530 --> 00:48:54.507
Blue books will be here and
ready for you,

00:48:54.507 --> 00:48:56.179
and all will be okay.
 

00:48:56.179 --> 00:48:57.949
I'm saying calming midterm
things.

00:48:57.949 --> 00:48:59.980
It will all be good.
 

00:48:59.980 --> 00:49:05.000

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.050
Prof: This morning we'll
take up one of the themes--

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:08.914
that is to say,
we've described how the course

00:00:08.914 --> 00:00:13.868
is about specific diseases,
but it's also about a number of

00:00:13.868 --> 00:00:17.297
overarching themes,
and one of those is the

00:00:17.297 --> 00:00:21.170
development of various public
health strategies.

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.016
So far, as you'll remember,
we've dealt with three public

00:00:25.016 --> 00:00:26.390
health strategies.
 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:32.253
One was the system of plague
measures: sanitary cordons,

00:00:32.253 --> 00:00:37.480
lazarettos, quarantine,
and all the rest of it.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.175
We've dealt with vaccination as
a public health strategy,

00:00:42.175 --> 00:00:45.530
with regard to smallpox in
particular.

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.484
And we've talked about a third
policy, if we want to dignify it

00:00:50.484 --> 00:00:54.960
in that way, and this was the
strategy of concealment.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.460
This morning I want to talk
about a fourth approach to

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.856
public health,
and this was what's called

00:01:02.856 --> 00:01:05.828
commonly the sanitary movement.
 

00:01:05.828 --> 00:01:11.879
This was pioneered in Britain
in the 1830s and '40s,

00:01:11.879 --> 00:01:17.260
and it was then exported to the
continent in North America,

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.110
assuming particular forms in
France and Italy,

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.420
with the actual rebuilding of
cities in accord with sanitary

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:27.590
principles.
 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:33.093
Now, the sanitary movement was
the first to define itself as a

00:01:33.093 --> 00:01:37.334
public health movement,
and it had two essential

00:01:37.334 --> 00:01:39.680
meanings for its term.
 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:45.126
The first was the prevention of
infectious epidemic diseases,

00:01:45.126 --> 00:01:48.940
and the second was the removal
of filth.

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.680
So, it's based,
in a sense, on the relationship

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.550
of filth and disease.
 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:59.163
Indeed, many people talk about
the filth theory of disease as

00:01:59.163 --> 00:02:02.700
lying at the basis of the
sanitary movement.

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.347
Its focus, therefore,
was on the towns and cities

00:02:07.347 --> 00:02:12.576
that had sprung up with
urbanization and the industrial

00:02:12.576 --> 00:02:14.030
revolution.
 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.677
Epidemic diseases
disproportionately claimed their

00:02:18.677 --> 00:02:23.697
victims in the cities,
and correspondingly the legacy

00:02:23.697 --> 00:02:28.287
of lasting effects was
especially pronounced in urban

00:02:28.287 --> 00:02:31.519
areas,
and the sanitary movement is

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:34.120
one of those lasting legacies.
 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.979
Now, there is a theory that we
may as well look at,

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:43.504
just for a second,
developed by the British

00:02:43.504 --> 00:02:49.030
physician and demographer,
Thomas McKeown--and it's often

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.686
called his thesis--
where he was dealing with the

00:02:53.686 --> 00:02:58.970
demographic fact of what he
called a mortality revolution;

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.699
a demographic transition in
which cities,

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:06.340
for the first time,
become places that are

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.668
dependent for their expansion
not only on inward migration to

00:03:11.668 --> 00:03:15.407
the towns,
but on the fact that the

00:03:15.407 --> 00:03:21.330
longevity and the birthrate come
to exceed the death rate;

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.340
which was something new,
a real demographic revolution.

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.930
And why was this achieved?
 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:34.635
Many people have thought and
postulated that it was due to

00:03:34.635 --> 00:03:39.930
medical science,
to conscious policy and those

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.990
sorts of explanations.
 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:46.500
McKeown instead stresses two
factors.

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.216
He sees this as largely
unplanned and due to improved

00:03:50.216 --> 00:03:54.575
nutrition, but also--and that's
the point this morning--to the

00:03:54.575 --> 00:03:56.220
role of sanitation.
 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.310
In other words,
the population explosion,

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:04.328
the demographic revolution,
is something that he postulates

00:04:04.328 --> 00:04:07.575
was due to,
not to medical science,

00:04:07.575 --> 00:04:10.939
but rather to the sanitary
movement,

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:13.560
and also to nutrition.
 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.819
Well, what was the background
to the sanitary movement?

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:23.112
We've seen and mentioned that
there really was a tremendous

00:04:23.112 --> 00:04:27.766
challenge to health in this
period of the industrial

00:04:27.766 --> 00:04:30.959
revolution in European history.
 

00:04:30.959 --> 00:04:35.819
There were tremendous changes
afoot in British society.

00:04:35.819 --> 00:04:40.625
There was the rise of a modern
commercial agriculture,

00:04:40.625 --> 00:04:45.432
and with it enclosure,
the driving of peasants off the

00:04:45.432 --> 00:04:46.250
land.
 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:50.125
We know about the major
demographic growth that was

00:04:50.125 --> 00:04:53.663
underway by this period,
supported by the new

00:04:53.663 --> 00:04:57.776
agriculture and the fading of
the threat of famine and the

00:04:57.776 --> 00:05:00.230
fading of the threat of plague.
 

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:03.350
There was the rise of
manufacture,

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:07.317
and then the factory system,
especially the textile

00:05:07.317 --> 00:05:10.045
industry,
and the associated and

00:05:10.045 --> 00:05:14.160
unregulated horrors of things
such as long hours,

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.629
low wages, child labor.
 

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:20.110
You know, too,
that across Europe,

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:24.622
urban populations doubled in
the first half of the nineteenth

00:05:24.622 --> 00:05:27.845
century,
and in so doing overwhelmed the

00:05:27.845 --> 00:05:30.379
infrastructure of available
jobs,

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:33.600
the housing stock,
sanitary arrangements,

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.319
and all the rest,
so that we see the rise of

00:05:36.319 --> 00:05:39.560
tenement slums,
sweatshops.

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:45.459
There was a mass movement of
population from countryside to

00:05:45.459 --> 00:05:50.850
town, and with that went
psychological adjustments.

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:55.809
There was a breakdown of older
notions of social relations

00:05:55.809 --> 00:06:00.072
based on paternalism,
of the customary notion of a

00:06:00.072 --> 00:06:03.899
moral economy based on moral
obligation.

00:06:03.899 --> 00:06:08.440
And we see instead the rise of
the principles of impersonal

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:11.209
relations,
of a free-market economy,

00:06:11.209 --> 00:06:14.437
and laissez-faire,
epitomized in the new

00:06:14.437 --> 00:06:18.744
discipline of political economy,
with such figures,

00:06:18.744 --> 00:06:23.562
of course, as Adam Smith,
Ricardo, Jeremy Bentham,

00:06:23.562 --> 00:06:25.430
Thomas Malthus.
 

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:29.577
The result, along with those
transformations,

00:06:29.577 --> 00:06:32.970
was a rise of new social
tensions.

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:37.240
We've talked about the
nineteenth century as the

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:39.149
rebellious century.
 

00:06:39.149 --> 00:06:42.786
Now, in Britain,
there were no social and

00:06:42.786 --> 00:06:48.997
political revolutions,
nothing comparable to 1789 in

00:06:48.997 --> 00:06:52.276
France,
or to what happened on the

00:06:52.276 --> 00:06:57.279
continent in 1830,
and in 1848 and '49.

00:06:57.279 --> 00:07:01.353
But contemporaries weren't
certain at all that this was

00:07:01.353 --> 00:07:04.750
going to be a lasting fortune
for Britain,

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:10.300
and indeed Britain did have a
number of signs of severe social

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:11.939
tension as well.
 

00:07:11.939 --> 00:07:14.778
There were large-scale riots.
 

00:07:14.778 --> 00:07:20.136
One could mention the Chartist
Movement, and in the countryside

00:07:20.136 --> 00:07:23.420
the movement known as Captain
Swing.

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:26.949
So, urban and industrial
centers, also in Britain,

00:07:26.949 --> 00:07:31.449
were perceived as dangerous,
politically,

00:07:31.449 --> 00:07:35.690
for fear of the so-called
dangerous classes who rioted,

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:40.319
perhaps committed crime,
threatened revolution,

00:07:40.319 --> 00:07:43.680
and were dangerous medically,
as well;

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:51.459
that is, they were infected
with cholera and other diseases.

00:07:51.459 --> 00:07:56.348
And it was cholera in
particular that was a real prod

00:07:56.348 --> 00:08:01.990
to action, this new and most
feared disease of the nineteenth

00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:03.120
century.
 

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:06.658
It's not by chance,
then, that the sanitary

00:08:06.658 --> 00:08:11.040
movement begins in the 1830s and
'40s in Britain,

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:16.648
after, that is to say,
the first pandemic and the

00:08:16.648 --> 00:08:19.920
second of Asiatic cholera.
 

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:25.798
And it lasts intermittently
down through the First World

00:08:25.798 --> 00:08:26.439
War.
 

00:08:26.439 --> 00:08:30.439
And this really was a vast
movement.

00:08:30.439 --> 00:08:34.374
It was nothing less than the
retrofitting of the urban

00:08:34.374 --> 00:08:38.884
centers of the nation,
with the specific goal of

00:08:38.884 --> 00:08:43.746
removing filth,
because filth was held to be

00:08:43.746 --> 00:08:46.149
the cause of disease.
 

00:08:46.149 --> 00:08:50.961
So, we're talking about one of
the great public works projects

00:08:50.961 --> 00:08:54.433
of modern history:
the establishment of sewer

00:08:54.433 --> 00:08:58.416
systems,
a whole infrastructure of water

00:08:58.416 --> 00:09:01.129
mains,
of waste removal,

00:09:01.129 --> 00:09:05.470
street cleansing,
improved and less crowded

00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:09.788
housing, the creation of parks
and public spaces.

00:09:09.788 --> 00:09:16.712
We can see that Victorian
Britain truly was preoccupied

00:09:16.712 --> 00:09:22.740
with that combination of
excrement and water.

00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:26.927
All of this,
of course, presupposed as well

00:09:26.927 --> 00:09:30.320
the emergence of a modern state.
 

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:34.586
It was state power that alone
provided the wealth and

00:09:34.586 --> 00:09:39.427
organizational structures that
were needed to carry out this

00:09:39.427 --> 00:09:41.149
enormous project.
 

00:09:41.149 --> 00:09:46.053
And in turn we can see the
causal chain working in both

00:09:46.053 --> 00:09:51.048
ways, because the sanitary
movement was a very important

00:09:51.048 --> 00:09:54.500
factor in reinforcing state
power.

00:09:54.500 --> 00:10:00.248
Its implementation meant that
the state now invaded areas of

00:10:00.248 --> 00:10:05.509
life formerly regarded as
private, and appropriated for

00:10:05.509 --> 00:10:08.528
itself enormous new powers.
 

00:10:08.528 --> 00:10:12.596
And the reformers were
supported by Protestant and

00:10:12.596 --> 00:10:16.250
especially evangelical Christian
churches.

00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:18.879
Well, who were the leaders of
this movement?

00:10:18.879 --> 00:10:23.331
I think we should turn first of
all to this man,

00:10:23.331 --> 00:10:25.320
Sir Edwin Chadwick.
 

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:29.048
This is Edwin,
Sir Edwin, in his younger days.

00:10:29.048 --> 00:10:33.355
This may be a slightly more
familiar picture of him,

00:10:33.355 --> 00:10:35.548
I guess maybe at my age.
 

00:10:35.548 --> 00:10:40.477
In any case,
Sir Edwin wrote a major work

00:10:40.477 --> 00:10:44.056
collaboratively--
he produced it,

00:10:44.056 --> 00:10:49.003
let us say--which was called
"The Report on the Sanitary

00:10:49.003 --> 00:10:53.620
Condition of the Labouring
Population of Great Britain of

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:54.940
1842."
 

00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:58.418
Now, Chadwick wasn't a
physician at all,

00:10:58.418 --> 00:11:03.322
and this is part of the
background perhaps to the thesis

00:11:03.322 --> 00:11:05.908
I was mentioning earlier.
 

00:11:05.908 --> 00:11:11.278
He was instead a lawyer by
training from Manchester.

00:11:11.278 --> 00:11:16.947
And he was already well known,
in particular for his reform of

00:11:16.947 --> 00:11:22.773
welfare provisions in Britain;
that is, he was responsible in

00:11:22.773 --> 00:11:25.370
large part,
for the passage,

00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:30.566
from the old poor law,
which had provided relief as

00:11:30.566 --> 00:11:35.639
the birthright of every citizen
in distress;

00:11:35.639 --> 00:11:42.086
that is, the right to some form
of assistance or aid in time of

00:11:42.086 --> 00:11:43.230
distress.
 

00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:48.529
Chadwick's idea was to
economize, to minimize the cost

00:11:48.529 --> 00:11:54.830
of payments, to discourage the
poor from applying for relief.

00:11:54.830 --> 00:11:58.966
He wanted to make the
experience of receiving relief

00:11:58.966 --> 00:12:03.428
more painful than the experience
of distress itself,

00:12:03.428 --> 00:12:07.668
a principle that was dubbed
"the principle of least

00:12:07.668 --> 00:12:09.210
eligibility."
 

00:12:09.210 --> 00:12:11.960
The workhouse,
in other words,

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:16.322
was to be a place of
punishment, of pain and of

00:12:16.322 --> 00:12:17.649
suffering.
 

00:12:17.649 --> 00:12:20.813
So, work should be,
in the workhouse,

00:12:20.813 --> 00:12:26.000
more unpleasant than any to be
found in the labor market.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.743
And the diet should be
intentionally made to be

00:12:30.743 --> 00:12:36.312
loathsome, more so than what
could be found by the poor

00:12:36.312 --> 00:12:37.548
outside.
 

00:12:37.548 --> 00:12:42.240
The poor law bureaucracy was
also invoked,

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:47.471
and was an essential foundation
of the information on which

00:12:47.471 --> 00:12:52.342
Chadwick relied for the sanitary
report of the laboring

00:12:52.342 --> 00:12:55.230
population of Great Britain.
 

00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:59.460
This was the man who was the
same in both faces,

00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:04.230
with the new poor law and with
the sanitary report.

00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:11.000
The sanitary reform was also a
stark assertion of state power

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.500
as a means of social control.
 

00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:19.706
The intention was to discipline
and civilize the working classes

00:13:19.706 --> 00:13:22.928
in the interests of social
stability.

00:13:22.928 --> 00:13:27.720
Following in the wake of the
report was the establishment of

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:31.129
a Public Health Act of 1848 in
Britain,

00:13:31.129 --> 00:13:36.580
and a general Board of Health,
and such champions of sanitary

00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:42.090
reform as John Simon,
Thomas Southwood Smith and Neil

00:13:42.090 --> 00:13:42.950
Arnott.
 

00:13:42.950 --> 00:13:49.081
Now, let's talk for a minute
about this man's ideology and

00:13:49.081 --> 00:13:50.909
his intentions.
 

00:13:50.909 --> 00:13:55.100
This was a class-based movement.
 

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:59.149
It was top-down and
centralizing.

00:13:59.149 --> 00:14:02.264
In Chadwick's mind,
the poor were largely

00:14:02.264 --> 00:14:04.990
responsible for their own
plight.

00:14:04.990 --> 00:14:09.114
They weren't innocent,
and they certainly weren't

00:14:09.114 --> 00:14:10.058
harmless.
 

00:14:10.058 --> 00:14:15.960
His mission was to cleanse and
civilize the dangerous classes.

00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:21.745
As I said, he wasn't a
physician, and his reforms were

00:14:21.745 --> 00:14:26.548
not based on any new medical
discoveries,

00:14:26.548 --> 00:14:31.671
on scientific experimentation
or observation to determine what

00:14:31.671 --> 00:14:36.371
measures were most effective by
determining the causes of

00:14:36.371 --> 00:14:37.379
disease.
 

00:14:37.379 --> 00:14:41.774
His reform measures,
enormous as they were,

00:14:41.774 --> 00:14:48.263
were based more on what was the
commonsense of the period and a

00:14:48.263 --> 00:14:50.668
priori assumptions.
 

00:14:50.668 --> 00:14:52.878
Public health,
in this way,

00:14:52.878 --> 00:14:57.548
was separate from the
development of medical science.

00:14:57.548 --> 00:15:02.576
His view--and this was widely
accepted--was that medicine was

00:15:02.576 --> 00:15:06.850
about private persons,
not so much public policy.

00:15:06.850 --> 00:15:11.951
And his idea was to use public
policy to cleanse the urban

00:15:11.951 --> 00:15:17.143
environment, but not to deal
with other social and economic

00:15:17.143 --> 00:15:19.649
determinants of disease.
 

00:15:19.649 --> 00:15:21.418
We'll talk about that in a
moment.

00:15:21.418 --> 00:15:25.547
We need to think about not only
about what Chadwick wanted to

00:15:25.547 --> 00:15:27.692
do,
but we also need to think about

00:15:27.692 --> 00:15:31.139
what he decided not to do,
what wasn't important to him.

00:15:31.139 --> 00:15:34.629
And so we should see this as
progress, yes,

00:15:34.629 --> 00:15:39.447
but progress that came at a
cost, and we want to know about

00:15:39.447 --> 00:15:40.860
that as well.
 

00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:45.100
Now, an influence on Chadwick's
thinking was "The Essay on

00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:47.700
Population"
of Thomas Malthus,

00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:52.010
who believed that there was a
law that in every society

00:15:52.010 --> 00:15:56.881
population pressure sooner or
later pressed against the limits

00:15:56.881 --> 00:15:58.399
of subsistence.
 

00:15:58.399 --> 00:16:03.437
So, real improvement for the
poor was likely to be illusory,

00:16:03.437 --> 00:16:07.278
short-term, and perhaps
counter-productive.

00:16:07.278 --> 00:16:10.212
In the long run,
really significant improvement

00:16:10.212 --> 00:16:12.700
couldn't occur,
according to Malthus.

00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:15.629
It might even be
self-defeating,

00:16:15.629 --> 00:16:19.221
leading to disease,
starvation and war,

00:16:19.221 --> 00:16:24.418
those great positive checks on
population increase.

00:16:24.418 --> 00:16:29.392
That idea of the limited nature
of possible improvement was in

00:16:29.392 --> 00:16:35.168
Chadwick's mind;
the poor will always be with us.

00:16:35.168 --> 00:16:39.366
There was also,
as I said, the filth theory of

00:16:39.366 --> 00:16:40.299
disease.
 

00:16:40.299 --> 00:16:41.788
We know it.
 

00:16:41.788 --> 00:16:47.311
We've talked about miasma and
its long history in European

00:16:47.311 --> 00:16:48.279
thought.
 

00:16:48.279 --> 00:16:53.658
Well, filth now was associated
very closely with smell.

00:16:53.658 --> 00:16:57.517
And if you are to read the
report at some point,

00:16:57.517 --> 00:17:02.359
you would notice that smells
constitute an important part of

00:17:02.359 --> 00:17:03.590
the report.
 

00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:08.460
The report is filled with
descriptions of stench.

00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:13.089
The authorities consulted by
Chadwick frequently used phrases

00:17:13.089 --> 00:17:17.127
such as,
"I was assailed by a most

00:17:17.127 --> 00:17:22.025
disagreeable smell,
and it was clear to me that the

00:17:22.025 --> 00:17:25.980
air was full of most injurious
malaria."

00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:30.315
By malaria, that's another word
that occurs throughout the

00:17:30.315 --> 00:17:31.000
report.
 

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.904
And we should note that before
malaria came to mean a specific

00:17:34.904 --> 00:17:37.403
disease,
it meant "bad air,"

00:17:37.403 --> 00:17:39.630
from the Italian mal'
aria,

00:17:39.630 --> 00:17:40.529
bad air.
 

00:17:40.529 --> 00:17:44.242
And, so, this report,
in Britain in the 1840s,

00:17:44.242 --> 00:17:49.029
is filled with descriptions of
what they called malaria.

00:17:49.029 --> 00:17:53.944
Let me give you an example from
the town in the West Country of

00:17:53.944 --> 00:17:54.578
Truro.
 

00:17:54.578 --> 00:17:59.464
Reporting to Chadwick,
the reporting official said,

00:17:59.464 --> 00:18:01.614
"Passing into St.
 

00:18:01.614 --> 00:18:05.913
Mary's Parish,
the proportion of sickness and

00:18:05.913 --> 00:18:10.308
deaths is as great as any part
of Truro.

00:18:10.308 --> 00:18:14.788
But there's no mystery at all
in the causation.

00:18:14.788 --> 00:18:19.278
Ill-constructed houses with
decomposing refuse,

00:18:19.278 --> 00:18:22.519
clothes upon their doors and
windows,

00:18:22.519 --> 00:18:27.088
open drains,
bring the oozings of pigsties

00:18:27.088 --> 00:18:32.548
and filth to stagnate at the
foot of the walls.

00:18:32.548 --> 00:18:36.788
Such are a few of the sources
of disease, which even the

00:18:36.788 --> 00:18:40.490
breezes from the hills cannot
dissipate."

00:18:40.490 --> 00:18:45.529
Everywhere the reports
discovered disease,

00:18:45.529 --> 00:18:51.171
and they correlated the disease
with such findings as poisonous

00:18:51.171 --> 00:18:54.356
vapor,
morbific effluvia,

00:18:54.356 --> 00:19:01.240
filth, obnoxious effluvia,
poisonous exhalations,

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:04.150
miasma and malaria.
 

00:19:04.150 --> 00:19:08.665
The moral of the texts of those
conditions also preoccupied

00:19:08.665 --> 00:19:11.470
those who took part in the
report.

00:19:11.470 --> 00:19:14.415
Vice, alcohol,
intemperance,

00:19:14.415 --> 00:19:18.563
and then more poverty,
and still worse,

00:19:18.563 --> 00:19:20.200
more filth.
 

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:25.528
Poverty was partly the result
of depravity and improvidence,

00:19:25.528 --> 00:19:30.858
and those in turn reinforced
more poverty and more filth.

00:19:30.858 --> 00:19:35.450
Well, there was a political aim
behind the sanitary reform,

00:19:35.450 --> 00:19:40.565
and I think we might call this
a transformation that Chadwick

00:19:40.565 --> 00:19:45.510
was aiming at in the demographic
composition of the British

00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:46.788
population.
 

00:19:46.788 --> 00:19:50.115
In Chadwick's mind,
trade unions,

00:19:50.115 --> 00:19:53.650
which he abhorred,
demonstrations,

00:19:53.650 --> 00:19:58.118
strikes, the Chartist Movement,
and all the rest,

00:19:58.118 --> 00:20:02.267
were called by Chadwick
"wild and dangerous

00:20:02.267 --> 00:20:04.118
assemblages."
 

00:20:04.118 --> 00:20:09.170
But he noted that they were
mainly led by the young.

00:20:09.170 --> 00:20:15.101
Older, experienced workmen,
with family responsibilities,

00:20:15.101 --> 00:20:21.243
he found to be moderate and
temperate, and not to take part

00:20:21.243 --> 00:20:24.740
in strikes and social unrest.
 

00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:29.430
Therefore a high early death
rate,

00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:33.984
and poor sanitary conditions,
were actually politically

00:20:33.984 --> 00:20:37.144
destabilizing,
at least in his mind,

00:20:37.144 --> 00:20:41.170
because they led to the early
death of workmen,

00:20:41.170 --> 00:20:44.646
and hence to an
overrepresentation of the

00:20:44.646 --> 00:20:49.557
dangerous young,
and an under-representation of

00:20:49.557 --> 00:20:52.380
moderating older workmen.
 

00:20:52.380 --> 00:20:56.412
If we want to understand and
explain this view,

00:20:56.412 --> 00:21:01.759
perhaps we could invoke an
anachronism, to make an analogy.

00:21:01.759 --> 00:21:06.364
And we could use the analogy of
a nuclear reactor,

00:21:06.364 --> 00:21:11.907
and compare social unrest to a
meltdown of the reactor core,

00:21:11.907 --> 00:21:15.009
with disastrous consequences.
 

00:21:15.009 --> 00:21:19.596
Well, in terms of the reactor,
to prevent such events reactors

00:21:19.596 --> 00:21:21.545
make use,
as you know,

00:21:21.545 --> 00:21:26.856
of boron control rods that are
inserted to control the rate of

00:21:26.856 --> 00:21:30.079
fission of uranium and
plutonium,

00:21:30.079 --> 00:21:33.769
and to limit chain reactions.
 

00:21:33.769 --> 00:21:37.038
In this way,
what Chadwick wanted to do,

00:21:37.038 --> 00:21:42.423
by analogy, was to use older
people like control rods that

00:21:42.423 --> 00:21:48.280
would have the calming effect of
preventing social meltdown and

00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:50.358
social revolution.
 

00:21:50.358 --> 00:21:54.772
But to do that you had to do
something about infectious

00:21:54.772 --> 00:21:59.186
diseases, to achieve this
demographic transformation of

00:21:59.186 --> 00:22:00.740
the population.
 

00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:06.002
So, if infectious disease was
destabilizing for the state and

00:22:06.002 --> 00:22:09.862
political order,
a population subject to

00:22:09.862 --> 00:22:15.583
infectious disease moreover is
unlikely to be educated and to

00:22:15.583 --> 00:22:20.160
be open to the moral influence
of the clergy.

00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:25.481
And the absence of cleansing in
towns, Chadwick felt,

00:22:25.481 --> 00:22:29.986
would lead also to
demoralization and further

00:22:29.986 --> 00:22:31.420
depravity.
 

00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:37.175
Now, in all of this thinking,
let's remember too at what was

00:22:37.175 --> 00:22:37.858
lost.
 

00:22:37.858 --> 00:22:43.327
A striking feature of
Chadwick's view was the

00:22:43.327 --> 00:22:46.558
narrowness of its focus.
 

00:22:46.558 --> 00:22:50.440
The cause of ill health in
Victorian Britain--

00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:52.368
I think we should say not the
cause--

00:22:52.368 --> 00:22:55.358
the causes were undoubtedly
multiple,

00:22:55.358 --> 00:22:57.750
and one could think about low
wages,

00:22:57.750 --> 00:23:01.538
unregulated factories,
inadequate diet,

00:23:01.538 --> 00:23:04.414
poor clothing,
lack of education,

00:23:04.414 --> 00:23:07.650
working conditions in
sweatshops,

00:23:07.650 --> 00:23:10.239
mines and factories,
child labor,

00:23:10.239 --> 00:23:12.019
overcrowded housing.
 

00:23:12.019 --> 00:23:16.452
These I would call social and
economic determinants of

00:23:16.452 --> 00:23:17.288
disease.
 

00:23:17.288 --> 00:23:21.229
And there were voices,
particularly on the continent,

00:23:21.229 --> 00:23:25.018
for an alternative public
health that would address

00:23:25.018 --> 00:23:27.670
precisely such broad interests.
 

00:23:27.670 --> 00:23:31.512
There was an older tradition of
what was called a "medical

00:23:31.512 --> 00:23:35.212
police" on the continent,
and a current of thought of

00:23:35.212 --> 00:23:38.029
what was called "social
medicine",

00:23:38.029 --> 00:23:42.900
whose most prominent figure was
this man,

00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:48.686
Rudolph Virchow,
a Prussian physician who lived

00:23:48.686 --> 00:23:52.833
from 1821 to 1902,
and was one of the great

00:23:52.833 --> 00:23:55.338
figures of nineteenth century
medicine;

00:23:55.338 --> 00:23:58.396
a physician,
anthropologist,

00:23:58.396 --> 00:24:02.358
biologist and radical
politician.

00:24:02.358 --> 00:24:06.538
Now, his view was that disease
was not simply a biological

00:24:06.538 --> 00:24:09.618
event, but a socially driven
phenomenon.

00:24:09.618 --> 00:24:13.194
And his meaning of the term
"social medicine"

00:24:13.194 --> 00:24:16.571
was that physicians should
treat not just individual

00:24:16.571 --> 00:24:21.815
patients but entire societies,
and that they should pay great

00:24:21.815 --> 00:24:25.519
attention to matters of the
economy,

00:24:25.519 --> 00:24:29.509
to diet, wages,
housing, child labor,

00:24:29.509 --> 00:24:32.150
working conditions.
 

00:24:32.150 --> 00:24:37.480
Virchow was,
in a sense, the anti-Chadwick.

00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:45.067
Chadwick's intention instead
was to focus on the narrow issue

00:24:45.067 --> 00:24:50.664
of filth and water,
and his attention was confined

00:24:50.664 --> 00:24:56.108
to the working classes and the
filth in which they lived.

00:24:56.108 --> 00:25:01.800
At stake was the issue of how
broad should a public health

00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:03.200
movement be?
 

00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:08.289
And perhaps one could say that
one of the sad features of the

00:25:08.289 --> 00:25:13.465
period was the triumph of the
narrowest gauge vision of public

00:25:13.465 --> 00:25:14.400
health.
 

00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:18.152
The solution,
in Chadwick's hands--and this

00:25:18.152 --> 00:25:23.243
was a major event in public
health, there's no doubt about

00:25:23.243 --> 00:25:23.868
it.
 

00:25:23.868 --> 00:25:28.170
I'm trying to say--not that
this was unfortunate--it was

00:25:28.170 --> 00:25:30.358
only unfortunately narrow.
 

00:25:30.358 --> 00:25:36.115
Chadwick's solution involved
technological measures,

00:25:36.115 --> 00:25:40.404
all good in themselves:
drains, sewers,

00:25:40.404 --> 00:25:42.210
water pipes.
 

00:25:42.210 --> 00:25:46.780
But they didn't include social,
economic and educational

00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:47.529
reform.
 

00:25:47.529 --> 00:25:50.650
And the reforms all came from
above,

00:25:50.650 --> 00:25:54.269
and reinforced a centralizing
state,

00:25:54.269 --> 00:25:58.679
rather than finding ways to
empower ordinary people to

00:25:58.679 --> 00:26:02.338
participate in defending their
own health.

00:26:02.338 --> 00:26:05.815
Let me give you an example of a
simple technological

00:26:05.815 --> 00:26:06.769
improvement.
 

00:26:06.769 --> 00:26:11.009
It might be hard to recognize
when you first look at it but--

00:26:11.009 --> 00:26:15.895
and I'm talking about some very
humble movements that have

00:26:15.895 --> 00:26:19.838
enormous political and medical
consequences.

00:26:19.838 --> 00:26:22.880
What we're looking at is a
sewer main,

00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:28.866
and these were established
under the soil of cities in this

00:26:28.866 --> 00:26:31.743
period,
and one of the technological

00:26:31.743 --> 00:26:34.838
inventions was to make the
sewers egg shaped,

00:26:34.838 --> 00:26:39.779
so that you would maximize the
flow and they would be

00:26:39.779 --> 00:26:44.910
self-cleaning and they would
drain most efficiently.

00:26:44.910 --> 00:26:50.558
So, technological innovations
of that sort were part of it.

00:26:50.558 --> 00:26:56.252
Now, the victory of Chadwick's
vision of public health wasn't

00:26:56.252 --> 00:27:00.426
simply automatic,
and so it was worth to keep

00:27:00.426 --> 00:27:02.798
alternatives in mind.
 

00:27:02.798 --> 00:27:07.529
His side was the winning side
in a debate of the early

00:27:07.529 --> 00:27:10.742
nineteenth century,
and a wider view,

00:27:10.742 --> 00:27:13.689
like that of Virchow,
was present,

00:27:13.689 --> 00:27:16.009
but lost the debate.
 

00:27:16.009 --> 00:27:22.028
Let's be clear in summation.
 

00:27:22.028 --> 00:27:26.830
I'd argue that Chadwick's
vision of public health was

00:27:26.830 --> 00:27:31.113
highly successful,
that it was a crucial part of

00:27:31.113 --> 00:27:35.640
the mortality revolution of
nineteenth century Europe,

00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:39.180
but that at the same time
something was lost,

00:27:39.180 --> 00:27:42.868
a broad vision of the causes of
disease,

00:27:42.868 --> 00:27:46.980
and those causes weren't
addressed.

00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:51.313
Although what Chadwick achieved
was a major and positive

00:27:51.313 --> 00:27:54.777
advance,
it perhaps fell short of what

00:27:54.777 --> 00:27:58.480
might have been,
and it demonstrates the

00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:03.118
practical and positive impact of
miasmatic theory.

00:28:03.118 --> 00:28:06.249
And public health,
a theory--and this is perhaps

00:28:06.249 --> 00:28:08.778
something we ought to bear in
mind--

00:28:08.778 --> 00:28:14.278
that a theory that is by now
rejected--

00:28:14.278 --> 00:28:18.940
that is miasmatism,
the filth theory of disease--

00:28:18.940 --> 00:28:25.256
did operate in such a way as to
promote major and positive

00:28:25.256 --> 00:28:27.140
health results.
 

00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:31.782
And one of the causes of this
movement was the epidemic

00:28:31.782 --> 00:28:36.167
disease that we dealt with the
last couple of times,

00:28:36.167 --> 00:28:38.920
and that is Asiatic cholera.
 

00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:44.093
We might note there was a
sidelight that may be of

00:28:44.093 --> 00:28:48.438
interest as well;
that this sanitary movement,

00:28:48.438 --> 00:28:53.979
the literal sanitary movement,
was accompanied in some places

00:28:53.979 --> 00:28:59.240
by what we might call a
figurative sanitary movement,

00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:04.769
and that is moral sanitation.
 

00:29:04.769 --> 00:29:09.061
And one of those was
particularly notable in France

00:29:09.061 --> 00:29:13.440
where there was a great fear of
another disease,

00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:16.690
that we'll be talking about
slightly later in the course,

00:29:16.690 --> 00:29:19.000
and that is syphilis.
 

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:24.391
Remember, the early nineteenth
century, we're dealing with the

00:29:24.391 --> 00:29:28.278
period in the wake of the
Napoleonic wars.

00:29:28.278 --> 00:29:33.047
And with those wars,
as always happens--or

00:29:33.047 --> 00:29:39.791
happened--there was a major
upsurge in socially transmitted

00:29:39.791 --> 00:29:44.558
diseases, and in particular
syphilis.

00:29:44.558 --> 00:29:49.273
And so this sanitary movement
was accompanied by the movement

00:29:49.273 --> 00:29:54.301
for moral sanitation through the
registration and surveillance of

00:29:54.301 --> 00:29:55.558
prostitutes.
 

00:29:55.558 --> 00:30:01.551
And in France those responsible
for moral sanitation actually

00:30:01.551 --> 00:30:06.200
made the link explicit;
that is to say that they

00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:10.590
compared brothels with sewers,
and said that they,

00:30:10.590 --> 00:30:14.175
the brothels,
should become the target of

00:30:14.175 --> 00:30:15.608
sanitation.
 

00:30:15.608 --> 00:30:20.973
So this was a form of moral
sanitation that was an offshoot

00:30:20.973 --> 00:30:26.338
of the literal sanitary movement
that is our main theme.

00:30:26.338 --> 00:30:33.438
The sanitary worldview led also
on the continent to further

00:30:33.438 --> 00:30:38.087
offshoots,
and that--I want to talk now

00:30:38.087 --> 00:30:43.769
about a continental form of the
sanitary movement,

00:30:43.769 --> 00:30:48.009
the rebuilding of cities in
their entirety.

00:30:48.009 --> 00:30:52.579
This was actually much more
comprehensive and systematic.

00:30:52.579 --> 00:30:55.848
It means urban planning.
 

00:30:55.848 --> 00:31:00.364
It's more comprehensive than
what happened in Britain,

00:31:00.364 --> 00:31:05.304
which was the retrofitting of
cities with sewers and drains

00:31:05.304 --> 00:31:07.690
and sanitary provisions.
 

00:31:07.690 --> 00:31:11.829
It entailed the actual leveling
of whole cities,

00:31:11.829 --> 00:31:15.794
or neighborhoods within them,
to start afresh,

00:31:15.794 --> 00:31:19.670
in accordance with a
comprehensive plan.

00:31:19.670 --> 00:31:22.028
There were a number of
prototypes.

00:31:22.028 --> 00:31:27.329
In France, Paris,
Lyon and Marseilles.

00:31:27.329 --> 00:31:29.818
In Belgium, Brussels.
 

00:31:29.818 --> 00:31:32.911
In Naples--that is in Italy,
there was Naples,

00:31:32.911 --> 00:31:34.971
as you know,
but also Florence,

00:31:34.971 --> 00:31:37.170
La Spezia, and other places.
 

00:31:37.170 --> 00:31:43.000
But let's begin in Paris,
because that established the

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:44.098
pattern.
 

00:31:44.098 --> 00:31:50.532
Here again we see the influence
of epidemic cholera,

00:31:50.532 --> 00:31:57.220
which ravaged Paris in the
1830s and again in 1849.

00:31:57.220 --> 00:32:02.192
And this caused an enormous
psychological shock,

00:32:02.192 --> 00:32:08.647
the idea that civilization was
no sure-fire protection against

00:32:08.647 --> 00:32:12.140
sudden and agonizing disease.
 

00:32:12.140 --> 00:32:16.558
There was an unbearable
contradiction that a city,

00:32:16.558 --> 00:32:20.539
that is Paris,
that prided itself at being at

00:32:20.539 --> 00:32:24.430
the heart of European
intellectual life,

00:32:24.430 --> 00:32:29.078
at being the leading city in
the arts and culture,

00:32:29.078 --> 00:32:31.739
a world center,
as you now know,

00:32:31.739 --> 00:32:35.780
of scientific medicine,
could nevertheless be

00:32:35.780 --> 00:32:40.868
devastated by a disease that was
associated with poverty,

00:32:40.868 --> 00:32:46.788
with filth, and with the
colonial world.

00:32:46.788 --> 00:32:51.750
Well, after the revolutions of
1848 to '49,

00:32:51.750 --> 00:32:57.903
we have a reactionary and
authoritarian regime established

00:32:57.903 --> 00:33:03.452
by Louis Napoleon Bonaparte,
or Napoleon III,

00:33:03.452 --> 00:33:08.549
that soon became the Second
Empire,

00:33:08.549 --> 00:33:13.750
that lasted from 1851 'til 1870.
 

00:33:13.750 --> 00:33:16.000
There's Napoleon III.
 

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:20.420
He undertook a major movement
to rebuild Paris.

00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:24.268
And I want to argue that this
had enormous sanitary

00:33:24.268 --> 00:33:26.827
consequences,
intentionally so,

00:33:26.827 --> 00:33:30.809
and that the experience of
epidemic cholera was very

00:33:30.809 --> 00:33:34.088
important in the establishment
of that.

00:33:34.088 --> 00:33:39.042
But I don't want to say that
the rebuilding of Paris was

00:33:39.042 --> 00:33:44.178
solely designed as a health
measure, and solely to prevent

00:33:44.178 --> 00:33:46.519
the return of cholera.
 

00:33:46.519 --> 00:33:49.108
There were other gains as well.
 

00:33:49.108 --> 00:33:54.029
Napoleon III wanted imperial
splendor.

00:33:54.029 --> 00:33:59.385
He wanted a city that would be
worthy of the role of France in

00:33:59.385 --> 00:34:04.304
the world, that would be a
showcase for his new political

00:34:04.304 --> 00:34:05.269
regime.
 

00:34:05.269 --> 00:34:09.389
He too was thinking about
social control.

00:34:09.389 --> 00:34:13.938
So, there was a political aim;
that was, to destroy the

00:34:13.938 --> 00:34:20.099
working class slums that had
been the sites of rebellion.

00:34:20.099 --> 00:34:25.615
The idea was to use urban
renewal to remove workers from

00:34:25.615 --> 00:34:30.130
the center of the city to
distant suburbs,

00:34:30.130 --> 00:34:35.920
and in the center to construct
wide boulevards that could not

00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:40.972
be defended by barricades,
and that the troops could use

00:34:40.972 --> 00:34:43.768
to move quickly across the
cities,

00:34:43.768 --> 00:34:48.273
and cannonballs could fire down
the boulevards to demolish

00:34:48.273 --> 00:34:49.300
barricades.
 

00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:52.840
In other words,
Paris was to be made

00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:57.900
revolution-proof,
or at least that was the goal.

00:34:57.900 --> 00:35:01.530
It was also a project of public
works;

00:35:01.530 --> 00:35:05.429
that is, it was a means of
enormous patronage.

00:35:05.429 --> 00:35:09.949
It would provide employment and
would defuse social tensions as

00:35:09.949 --> 00:35:10.460
well.
 

00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:16.550
So, Paris, under Napoleon III,
became a vast public works

00:35:16.550 --> 00:35:21.119
project, enormous shovel-ready
projects.

00:35:21.119 --> 00:35:26.144
The workers of Paris then would
be employed and therefore

00:35:26.144 --> 00:35:27.849
largely pacified.
 

00:35:27.849 --> 00:35:31.960
It was thought that this would
also have an economic role.

00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:34.958
The new boulevards,
the wide spaces,

00:35:34.958 --> 00:35:40.012
would facilitate the movement
of goods and assist free trade

00:35:40.012 --> 00:35:41.469
and commerce.
 

00:35:41.469 --> 00:35:45.987
And then there was the public
health objective:

00:35:45.987 --> 00:35:50.114
to improve health,
to prevent the return of

00:35:50.114 --> 00:35:52.570
infectious epidemics.
 

00:35:52.570 --> 00:35:58.445
The task was entrusted to this
man, Georges Haussmann,

00:35:58.445 --> 00:36:01.440
the Prefect of the Seine.
 

00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:05.420
And often what was accomplished
is referred to as the

00:36:05.420 --> 00:36:08.559
"Haussmannization"
of Paris,

00:36:08.559 --> 00:36:12.630
with the so-called great works,
or grands travaux,

00:36:12.630 --> 00:36:18.280
that were undertaken from 1852
until 1870.

00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:22.590
Now, this project was
authoritarian.

00:36:22.590 --> 00:36:25.940
The rights of individuals were
disregarded.

00:36:25.940 --> 00:36:30.378
The population was not
consulted about being moved,

00:36:30.378 --> 00:36:34.730
and it was an operation of
colossal complexity.

00:36:34.730 --> 00:36:40.289
All of the affairs of one of
the greatest cities in France,

00:36:40.289 --> 00:36:45.715
the great city in France,
were gathered into a single

00:36:45.715 --> 00:36:48.429
pair of hands:
finance,

00:36:48.429 --> 00:36:52.349
administration,
transport, sanitation,

00:36:52.349 --> 00:36:55.014
engineering,
architecture,

00:36:55.014 --> 00:36:58.893
evictions,
expropriation of land by

00:36:58.893 --> 00:37:02.268
eminent domain,
slum clearance,

00:37:02.268 --> 00:37:06.340
gas fixtures and lighting,
sewers.

00:37:06.340 --> 00:37:11.391
All of this was an enormous
assertion, then,

00:37:11.391 --> 00:37:13.389
of state power.
 

00:37:13.389 --> 00:37:17.739
The means were broad
intersecting boulevards.

00:37:17.739 --> 00:37:21.389
Let me show you the sorts of
plans--

00:37:21.389 --> 00:37:25.619
were to have the great
boulevards of Paris,

00:37:25.619 --> 00:37:32.280
that you can see today--such as
the Rue de Rivoli,

00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:35.130
Boulevard de Strasbourg,
S�bastopol,

00:37:35.130 --> 00:37:36.690
the Boulevard Saint-Michel.
 

00:37:36.690 --> 00:37:40.746
The average size width of a
street in Paris was to be

00:37:40.746 --> 00:37:45.268
doubled, and underneath the
streets there were to be sewers

00:37:45.268 --> 00:37:46.440
and drains.
 

00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:50.413
There was to be water supply,
and there were to be broad

00:37:50.413 --> 00:37:54.460
parks and public spaces,
such as the Bois de Boulogne.

00:37:54.460 --> 00:37:59.449
The aesthetics were the
aesthetics of the straight line.

00:37:59.449 --> 00:38:00.889
We can see that there.
 

00:38:00.889 --> 00:38:03.570
We can see it also here.
 

00:38:03.570 --> 00:38:06.514
And you can see the
intersection of these broad

00:38:06.514 --> 00:38:09.994
boulevards,
and you can see how these were

00:38:09.994 --> 00:38:13.530
multi-purpose and would allow
not only--

00:38:13.530 --> 00:38:17.360
part of the idea was the
miasmatic one,

00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:22.327
that they would allow air and
light to sweep through the city

00:38:22.327 --> 00:38:28.860
and remove the noxious smells,
and purify and cleanse the city.

00:38:28.860 --> 00:38:34.914
And you can see as well that
they would be good for commerce

00:38:34.914 --> 00:38:37.480
and for social control.
 

00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:43.682
So, Paris, after Haussmann,
was clearly much healthier as a

00:38:43.682 --> 00:38:48.282
city than before,
and cholera did not return

00:38:48.282 --> 00:38:51.920
thereafter to the city center.
 

00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:57.617
But there is an irony here,
that cholera did return,

00:38:57.617 --> 00:39:00.969
less vehemently than before.
 

00:39:00.969 --> 00:39:05.733
But in the 1890s it did return,
but not to the center of the

00:39:05.733 --> 00:39:06.300
city.
 

00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:10.172
In other words,
part of the sanitary problem of

00:39:10.172 --> 00:39:14.731
Paris was not entirely solved,
but was exported to the

00:39:14.731 --> 00:39:19.456
suburbs, and it was the suburbs
that experienced the return of

00:39:19.456 --> 00:39:20.929
cholera in 1892.
 

00:39:20.929 --> 00:39:25.579
We have to see this as an
enormous sanitary success,

00:39:25.579 --> 00:39:28.768
but one that we ought to
qualify.

00:39:28.768 --> 00:39:33.889
Let me look at--let's
look--this is a map--a picture

00:39:33.889 --> 00:39:38.809
of the demolition,
to convince you of what a major

00:39:38.809 --> 00:39:41.320
undertaking this was.
 

00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:48.461
And there's a view of the new
open spaces, cleansed with light

00:39:48.461 --> 00:39:51.389
and air, and germ free.
 

00:39:51.389 --> 00:39:57.503
And also in Napoleon III's
mind, it would be also--make

00:39:57.503 --> 00:40:01.239
revolution much more difficult.
 

00:40:01.239 --> 00:40:05.753
Well there was--the political
success, as well as the

00:40:05.753 --> 00:40:11.050
sanitary--was a success but one
that needs to be qualified.

00:40:11.050 --> 00:40:15.454
There was an enormous
resentment among the working

00:40:15.454 --> 00:40:19.230
people of Paris at Haussmann's
project,

00:40:19.230 --> 00:40:24.152
and there was an enormous
history from that time down to

00:40:24.152 --> 00:40:28.179
nearly our own of hostility of
the suburbs.

00:40:28.179 --> 00:40:30.750
Paris becomes,
not by chance,

00:40:30.750 --> 00:40:35.708
surrounded by a red belt of
concluding hostility to the

00:40:35.708 --> 00:40:39.420
regime,
and this exploded in the spring

00:40:39.420 --> 00:40:44.472
of 1871 in the Paris Commune
that brought down the regime and

00:40:44.472 --> 00:40:48.010
led to the establishment of a
republic.

00:40:48.010 --> 00:40:52.179
So, there are also political
qualifications.

00:40:52.179 --> 00:40:56.409
Well, I'll move then to another
example very quickly,

00:40:56.409 --> 00:41:01.983
and one that is in the reading,
and that is the Italian

00:41:01.983 --> 00:41:05.606
version,
and in particular the

00:41:05.606 --> 00:41:11.949
risanamento of Naples,
which was Italy's largest city.

00:41:11.949 --> 00:41:15.764
As you know,
there was a massive epidemic in

00:41:15.764 --> 00:41:19.942
the city--
this is the plan of

00:41:19.942 --> 00:41:27.012
risanamento in Naples--
and as you know,

00:41:27.012 --> 00:41:32.101
it led to the idea--
and here is something that is

00:41:32.101 --> 00:41:35.603
actually unique;
that is to say that we've

00:41:35.603 --> 00:41:40.862
talked about the retrofitting of
British cities and also American

00:41:40.862 --> 00:41:41.518
ones.
 

00:41:41.518 --> 00:41:45.090
We've talked about the
rebuilding of Paris.

00:41:45.090 --> 00:41:50.648
Those were associated with a
variety of disease experiences,

00:41:50.648 --> 00:41:55.550
and they had purposes other
than a single disease.

00:41:55.550 --> 00:42:01.768
One can't see the retrofitting
of British cities as due solely

00:42:01.768 --> 00:42:06.969
to epidemic cholera,
nor the rebuilding of Paris.

00:42:06.969 --> 00:42:11.548
Here in Naples we have
something that's unusual and

00:42:11.548 --> 00:42:16.304
probably unique,
which is the actual rebuilding

00:42:16.304 --> 00:42:22.536
of a major European city for the
specific purpose of preventing

00:42:22.536 --> 00:42:25.050
the return of cholera.
 

00:42:25.050 --> 00:42:30.574
And the way that the plan was
developed reflected the specific

00:42:30.574 --> 00:42:36.010
medical understanding of the
time of the cause of cholera.

00:42:36.010 --> 00:42:42.920
And we see here too a form of
the filth theory of disease.

00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:46.739
The rebuilding of Naples was
for this single purpose,

00:42:46.739 --> 00:42:52.847
and the medical theory behind
the rebuilding project was

00:42:52.847 --> 00:42:58.956
specifically the miasmatic
theory of this physician from

00:42:58.956 --> 00:43:02.101
Bavaria,
Munich in particular,

00:43:02.101 --> 00:43:07.818
who is Max von Pettenkofer,
who had an enormous influence

00:43:07.818 --> 00:43:09.909
on public health.
 

00:43:09.909 --> 00:43:15.713
And one aspect of his influence
was that his theory lay at the

00:43:15.713 --> 00:43:19.139
basis of the rebuilding of
Naples.

00:43:19.139 --> 00:43:22.818
He developed the most
sophisticated of miasmatic

00:43:22.818 --> 00:43:26.889
theories in the nineteenth
century and was aimed--

00:43:26.889 --> 00:43:32.208
the aim then behind the
rebuilding of Naples was to thin

00:43:32.208 --> 00:43:34.239
out the population.
 

00:43:34.239 --> 00:43:39.429
Overcrowding was a cause of
disease,

00:43:39.429 --> 00:43:45.106
and poisonous vapors arising
from underneath the city

00:43:45.106 --> 00:43:50.117
poisoned the air,
people breathed in the poison

00:43:50.117 --> 00:43:56.619
and succumbed to cholera,
in Max Pettenkofer's view.

00:43:56.619 --> 00:44:00.860
The purpose of
risanamento then was

00:44:00.860 --> 00:44:05.929
first of all to raise the level
of the streets;

00:44:05.929 --> 00:44:10.248
that is to say,
the danger and the miasma was,

00:44:10.248 --> 00:44:15.719
if we like, fermenting beneath
the streets of the city.

00:44:15.719 --> 00:44:21.278
So, you want to place a greater
distance between the population

00:44:21.278 --> 00:44:26.750
living above and the poisonous
effluvia arising from below.

00:44:26.750 --> 00:44:31.920
And, so, the aspiration was to
raise the level of the streets

00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:35.110
to the second storey of the
houses.

00:44:35.110 --> 00:44:37.666
And there would be,
if you like,

00:44:37.666 --> 00:44:42.295
then a massive cushion,
including the mortar of the

00:44:42.295 --> 00:44:46.996
streets themselves,
between the population of the

00:44:46.996 --> 00:44:52.436
city and the danger lurking in
the groundwater beneath the

00:44:52.436 --> 00:44:53.199
soil.
 

00:44:53.199 --> 00:44:57.259
In addition,
the idea was that you would

00:44:57.259 --> 00:45:03.088
have Naples--there's a picture
of the old city that's--in

00:45:03.088 --> 00:45:07.670
various aspects--that's been
demolished;

00:45:07.670 --> 00:45:12.028
and here what I wanted to show
was this, the great access at

00:45:12.028 --> 00:45:14.969
the center;
and then there were various

00:45:14.969 --> 00:45:16.070
cross streets.
 

00:45:16.070 --> 00:45:20.981
The great boulevard at the
center was in the direction of

00:45:20.981 --> 00:45:25.222
the prevailing wind,
and it was called a bellows of

00:45:25.222 --> 00:45:29.889
fresh air that would allow the
wind to rush through the city,

00:45:29.889 --> 00:45:36.177
drying up the effluvia and
blowing away the stenches and

00:45:36.177 --> 00:45:41.550
allowing the sunlight to reach
ground level,

00:45:41.550 --> 00:45:46.150
and then it would be crossed by
a series of wide boulevards as

00:45:46.150 --> 00:45:46.679
well.
 

00:45:46.679 --> 00:45:50.199
And then under the--if this
happened above ground,

00:45:50.199 --> 00:45:53.250
there would also be work going
on beneath,

00:45:53.250 --> 00:45:59.266
and you would have a whole
sewage mains being built under

00:45:59.266 --> 00:46:00.449
the city.
 

00:46:00.449 --> 00:46:04.186
So, risanamento,
this enormous project,

00:46:04.186 --> 00:46:08.918
both above and below ground,
was related-- it was a cousin

00:46:08.918 --> 00:46:12.239
of the sanitary movement in
Britain.

00:46:12.239 --> 00:46:17.800
It was a first-cousin of the
rebuilding of Paris and Lyon.

00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:21.876
But it was distinctive too,
because it's the only example

00:46:21.876 --> 00:46:25.659
of a project conducted
exclusively for the purpose of

00:46:25.659 --> 00:46:30.550
defeating a single disease,
and that was cholera.

00:46:30.550 --> 00:46:32.750
Was it a success?
 

00:46:32.750 --> 00:46:35.610
Well, Naples was rebuilt.
 

00:46:35.610 --> 00:46:39.730
And there's no doubt that the
health of the city thereafter

00:46:39.730 --> 00:46:42.429
was greater than it had been
before.

00:46:42.429 --> 00:46:48.530
But unfortunately there too
there were qualifications.

00:46:48.530 --> 00:46:53.512
The rebuilding was marred,
marred perhaps partly by the

00:46:53.512 --> 00:46:57.480
flaws in its conception from the
outset,

00:46:57.480 --> 00:47:03.936
but marred also by the fact of
corruption and the misuse of the

00:47:03.936 --> 00:47:08.000
funds that were used to carry it
out.

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:13.802
And, so, we see thereafter that
although Naples was rebuilt in

00:47:13.802 --> 00:47:18.945
the aftermath of 1884,
that there was a return of

00:47:18.945 --> 00:47:25.539
cholera,
a major epidemic again, in 1911.

00:47:25.539 --> 00:47:32.182
And there was even a small coda
to that, which is another

00:47:32.182 --> 00:47:35.150
outbreak, even in 1973.
 

00:47:35.150 --> 00:47:37.789
So, the irony and conclusion.
 

00:47:37.789 --> 00:47:45.800
The sanitary movement in
Britain, retrofitting of cities,

00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:48.840
the rebuilding of cities in
France,

00:47:48.840 --> 00:47:53.931
the risanamento in
Naples, did achieve major

00:47:53.931 --> 00:47:54.949
success.
 

00:47:54.949 --> 00:48:00.155
But it's worth remembering that
they often weren't based on a

00:48:00.155 --> 00:48:03.280
medical theory that was to
endure.

00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:07.367
And indeed in the case of
Naples, it was a medical theory

00:48:07.367 --> 00:48:11.599
that very soon after the
rebuilding was to be discarded.

00:48:11.599 --> 00:48:16.246
No sooner had Naples been
rebuilt than the theories of

00:48:16.246 --> 00:48:21.070
Pettenkofer were overturned,
with the coming of the germ

00:48:21.070 --> 00:48:23.000
theory of disease.
 

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:26.896
So, when we're--one of the
questions we ask,

00:48:26.896 --> 00:48:31.610
then, was the lasting impact of
epidemic diseases.

00:48:31.610 --> 00:48:37.393
And I would argue that one of
the senses of lasting impact is

00:48:37.393 --> 00:48:43.369
one that's embodied in bricks
and mortar, in urban planning.

00:48:43.369 --> 00:48:49.730
And if you visit these cities,
then you can see the lasting

00:48:49.730 --> 00:48:56.199
legacy of epidemic disease in
the urban landscape itself.

00:48:56.199 --> 00:49:01.000

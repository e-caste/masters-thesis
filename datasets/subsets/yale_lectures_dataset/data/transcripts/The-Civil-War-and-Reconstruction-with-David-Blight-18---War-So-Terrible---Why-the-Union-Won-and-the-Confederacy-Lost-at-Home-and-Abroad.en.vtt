00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:17.252
Professor David Blight:
I want to start with what

00:00:17.252 --> 00:00:20.100
many Americans therefore do with
it.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.393
Some of you in this room may
have grown up Civil War buffs,

00:00:24.393 --> 00:00:28.362
like I did, I confess.
There are millions of Civil War

00:00:28.362 --> 00:00:31.611
tourists.
It has this enduring--the

00:00:31.611 --> 00:00:37.405
military history in particular,
the battle history--has an

00:00:37.405 --> 00:00:41.980
enduring, eternal hold on our
imagination.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.337
But this is a first for me.
I just got this email,

00:00:45.337 --> 00:00:49.137
well, a couple of weeks ago,
from a woman named Nicki

00:00:49.137 --> 00:00:52.280
Blackburn in Charleston,
South Carolina;

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.201
has her photograph on it.
She's a real estate agent,

00:00:57.201 --> 00:01:00.738
a pretty real estate agent.
[Laughter]

00:01:00.738 --> 00:01:06.367
And she wanted me to know as a
Civil War historian that she and

00:01:06.367 --> 00:01:11.543
her firm have put a twenty-four
hour webcam on the Calhoun

00:01:11.543 --> 00:01:16.446
Mansion near Battery Park--on
the cupola of the Calhoun

00:01:16.446 --> 00:01:21.349
Mansion--near Battery Park in
Lower Charleston,

00:01:21.349 --> 00:01:25.903
which looks out directly onto
Fort Sumter, a mile away,

00:01:25.903 --> 00:01:30.878
so that you can dialup on the
Internet and watch Fort Sumter

00:01:30.878 --> 00:01:33.240
twenty four hours a day.

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:44.534
[Laughter]
I've experienced a wide variety

00:01:44.534 --> 00:01:51.206
of bizarre phenomena about the
Civil War with reenactors,

00:01:51.206 --> 00:01:56.330
at sites and so on and so on
and so on.

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:02.156
And if you're on C-SPAN enough
believe me, you get every kind

00:02:02.156 --> 00:02:06.720
of late-night,
crazy American writing to you.

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.132
But that's a first.
Twenty-four hours,

00:02:10.132 --> 00:02:13.644
webcam, Fort Sumter.
I don't know what the hell

00:02:13.644 --> 00:02:16.232
you're supposed to see.
[Laughter]

00:02:16.232 --> 00:02:20.567
Maybe there are ghosts of
Confederates that come out at

00:02:20.567 --> 00:02:24.260
night, and if they have the
right kind of night

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.680
vision…God I don't know.
But she's serious!

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:30.570
I'm sorry.
All right.

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:47.298
In 1863, on the beautiful
little hilltop cemetery on the

00:02:47.298 --> 00:02:53.360
south edge of the town of
Gettysburg,

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.333
Pennsylvania--a small,
sleepy town with a large

00:02:57.333 --> 00:03:02.012
population of German immigrants,
a couple of little shoe

00:03:02.012 --> 00:03:06.101
factories, a crossroads town,
a market town--they had a

00:03:06.101 --> 00:03:08.979
cemetery in this beautiful
setting.

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:13.930
And, over the archway,
or as part of the archway into

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.310
that cemetery that would soon
become famous,

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:24.328
there was a sign that read,
quote, "All persons found using

00:03:24.328 --> 00:03:30.657
firearms on these grounds will
be prosecuted within the utmost

00:03:30.657 --> 00:03:35.410
rigor of the law."
Irony makes the world go 'round.

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.375
Okay, today I want to take up
with you at least the beginnings

00:03:44.375 --> 00:03:48.840
of the question of Confederate
defeat and Union victory.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.099
We're going to focus in
particular on battlefronts.

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:55.170
There are numerous reasons,
explanations,

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:59.316
causal interpretations for
Confederate defeat and Union

00:03:59.316 --> 00:04:03.768
victory that have flowed forth
in Civil War scholarship for

00:04:03.768 --> 00:04:06.648
years.
And we began to have a new kind

00:04:06.648 --> 00:04:09.680
of heated argument about it,
at least in books,

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.484
about 10 years ago,
in part because of a series of

00:04:14.484 --> 00:04:19.780
two books by historians named
Hattaway and Beringer.

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:22.433
They wrote two big tomes.
One was entitled Why the

00:04:22.433 --> 00:04:24.780
North Won the Civil War,
and the other was entitled

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.650
Why the South Lost the Civil
War;

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:31.537
not very subtle titles.
And they were the ones who

00:04:31.537 --> 00:04:34.934
posited, more than anyone ever
had before, in a much more

00:04:34.934 --> 00:04:38.209
sophisticated way--and I want to
come back to that,

00:04:38.209 --> 00:04:42.126
and it's part of exactly what's
at stake in these two wonderful

00:04:42.126 --> 00:04:44.399
books you're reading,
or have read,

00:04:44.399 --> 00:04:47.110
or are about to read,
by Drew Faust and Gary

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.371
Gallagher.
Gallagher's Confederate

00:04:49.371 --> 00:04:52.641
War and Faust's Mothers
of Invention take up this

00:04:52.641 --> 00:04:54.970
question of the so-called loss
of will.

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:59.783
Did the South lose the Civil
War because it ultimately lost

00:04:59.783 --> 00:05:04.766
its will to sustain the fight?
There are many sides to that

00:05:04.766 --> 00:05:08.340
argument, and I'll take it up in
a moment.

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:09.720
I want to do--.

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:31.203
Well anyway,
the Civil War,

00:05:31.203 --> 00:05:35.713
as we've said many times,
is the first great photographed

00:05:35.713 --> 00:05:39.185
event of American history.
There are thousands of

00:05:39.185 --> 00:05:41.614
photographs.
We'd have had thousands more if

00:05:41.614 --> 00:05:44.000
people hadn't destroyed so many
of them.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.194
And, of course,
Ken Burns's film series is in

00:05:47.194 --> 00:05:50.970
part--in great part--reliant on
those photographs,

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:55.124
and he and his cameramen,
of course, they have cameras

00:05:55.124 --> 00:05:59.907
now that can take right inside
almost these old daguerreotypes

00:05:59.907 --> 00:06:04.767
and tintypes and make them live
in ways that they didn't at the

00:06:04.767 --> 00:06:07.815
time.
But that's an image of soldiers

00:06:07.815 --> 00:06:09.790
at the front,
smoking a pipe,

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:12.975
petting his dog.
It's an officer whose wife has

00:06:12.975 --> 00:06:14.819
come to the front,
of course.

00:06:14.819 --> 00:06:19.865
It's winter quarters,
near Culpepper Courthouse,

00:06:19.865 --> 00:06:25.107
Virginia, 1863.
They always built these cabins

00:06:25.107 --> 00:06:29.223
with these chimneys.
They built thousands of these,

00:06:29.223 --> 00:06:32.770
with barrels on top;
those are their chimneys.

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:38.468
Since I've been discussing this
question of mobilization,

00:06:38.468 --> 00:06:40.290
there are many,
many images in the war,

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:42.604
from the war,
that show this kind of

00:06:42.604 --> 00:06:47.025
industrial might of the North.
There's incredible photographs

00:06:47.025 --> 00:06:50.790
of the James River landings in
Virginia by 1864,

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:54.953
and just as far as the horizon
can see supplies,

00:06:54.953 --> 00:06:58.940
the materiel piled up all over
the wharves.

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:03.760
This is an image in Virginia of
the wagon trains of the Potomac,

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:07.740
Army of the Potomac,
by 1864, thousands of wagons.

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:13.370
This is mobilization for total
war.

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:17.072
And I just for the sake of
reality want to show that also

00:07:17.072 --> 00:07:19.452
photographers,
like Matthew Brady and

00:07:19.452 --> 00:07:23.286
Alexander Gardner and their
troops of photographers--it was

00:07:23.286 --> 00:07:27.253
Gardner in particular who went
to Gettysburg after the Battle

00:07:27.253 --> 00:07:30.890
of Gettysburg and photographed
so many of them,

00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:35.105
so many of the dead.
This is a soldier,

00:07:35.105 --> 00:07:38.000
a Union soldier,
killed at Gettysburg.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.363
It became a kind of macabre
fascination, especially in the

00:07:42.363 --> 00:07:47.110
North where these photographs
were often displayed publicly.

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:50.965
Brady first started doing it in
'62 and early '63,

00:07:50.965 --> 00:07:53.720
and hence that famous comment
by,

00:07:53.720 --> 00:08:00.234
I believe, George Templeton
Strong who said it was Brady who

00:08:00.234 --> 00:08:04.430
brought the war into people's
homes,

00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:09.073
into their living rooms,
if they went to witness these

00:08:09.073 --> 00:08:13.160
photographs.
Now, more on that perhaps at

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:15.932
the end.
But go back with me now to this

00:08:15.932 --> 00:08:18.740
question of Union victory,
Confederate defeat.

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:21.808
We're not going to end the war
today, that's next week,

00:08:21.808 --> 00:08:24.819
and we're going to take the war
today through 1863,

00:08:24.819 --> 00:08:27.769
and major military turning
points where you can begin to

00:08:27.769 --> 00:08:30.129
make an argument,
from this point forward.

00:08:30.129 --> 00:08:34.000
From this point forward,
it would be very difficult for

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.368
the Confederacy to win,
although not impossible,

00:08:37.368 --> 00:08:40.893
as we'll see in 1864.
Now on any list--and I'm going

00:08:40.893 --> 00:08:44.072
to just give you a list out
front and then we'll kind of

00:08:44.072 --> 00:08:47.655
take up some of them--but on any
list of why the North wins and

00:08:47.655 --> 00:08:52.146
why the South loses,
of course, are these elements:

00:08:52.146 --> 00:08:57.658
One, resources and numbers.
It goes without saying in a

00:08:57.658 --> 00:09:02.700
world of war that is becoming
more industrialized,

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:06.644
more modern in its weaponry
and, to some extent,

00:09:06.644 --> 00:09:10.840
its tactics--although that's
one of the reasons,

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:14.967
of course, casualties in this
war were so ghastly because they

00:09:14.967 --> 00:09:18.080
were fighting with much more
modern weapons,

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:22.580
repeating rifles and of course
the rifled musket that could

00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:27.235
actually hit something at 800
yards and it could be deadly at

00:09:27.235 --> 00:09:31.039
2 to 300 yards.
Think of that, 2 to 300 yards.

00:09:31.039 --> 00:09:35.659
You could hit something and see
it.

00:09:35.659 --> 00:09:39.665
But they were fighting with old
tactics, line upon line,

00:09:39.665 --> 00:09:42.360
shoulder to shoulder,
double ranks.

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:45.168
If the front of the rank fell,
the second rank was supposed to

00:09:45.168 --> 00:09:48.022
be there, and they were supposed
to have loaded their rifles in

00:09:48.022 --> 00:09:50.463
time to be up front while the
other ones went back and

00:09:50.463 --> 00:09:53.737
reloaded again,
and that a veteran soldier in

00:09:53.737 --> 00:09:58.271
this war could load his muzzle
loader--you had to load the

00:09:58.271 --> 00:10:02.367
minie ball and the cap,
back here, and then with your

00:10:02.367 --> 00:10:06.632
ramrod--a veteran soldier could
do that without pressure about

00:10:06.632 --> 00:10:10.155
three times a minute.
Of course under the pressure of

00:10:10.155 --> 00:10:13.608
battle and being shot at and the
cacophony of sound and the

00:10:13.608 --> 00:10:16.049
terror and fear a soldier went
though,

00:10:16.049 --> 00:10:18.399
sometimes they couldn't perform
that.

00:10:18.399 --> 00:10:22.511
And all over battlefields in
this war they would find dead

00:10:22.511 --> 00:10:26.912
soldiers sometimes with a rifle
they had loaded three and four

00:10:26.912 --> 00:10:30.180
times, and never fired.
They just kept loading.

00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:34.834
They'd sort of lose their minds.
But in a war that is now fought

00:10:34.834 --> 00:10:38.723
with such weaponry--and it's
going to depend on industrial

00:10:38.723 --> 00:10:42.816
production--there is an argument
that this war was won by the

00:10:42.816 --> 00:10:45.750
North in the shoe factories of
Lowell,

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:48.723
Massachusetts,
or the gun factories of New

00:10:48.723 --> 00:10:52.203
Haven, or the gun factories of
Springfield, Mass,

00:10:52.203 --> 00:10:56.482
in the sheer productive--or on
those railroads of the North,

00:10:56.482 --> 00:10:59.679
which was so much better,
more efficient,

00:10:59.679 --> 00:11:01.769
than the railroads of the
South.

00:11:01.769 --> 00:11:05.269
There's certainly an argument
for that.

00:11:05.269 --> 00:11:10.217
Now, that handwriting was on
the wall from the beginning of

00:11:10.217 --> 00:11:13.619
the war.
In a lovely old book that David

00:11:13.619 --> 00:11:17.649
Donald did once called Why
the North Won,

00:11:17.649 --> 00:11:20.087
he quotes on the first page of
the book a newspaper in

00:11:20.087 --> 00:11:23.610
Lynchburg, Virginia,
summer 1861;

00:11:23.610 --> 00:11:26.693
the Battle of Bull Run hasn't
even happened yet,

00:11:26.693 --> 00:11:30.863
and all this fury for war.
The editor of the Lynchburg

00:11:30.863 --> 00:11:34.675
Virginian wrote,
quote: "Dependent upon Europe

00:11:34.675 --> 00:11:39.498
and the North for almost every
yard of cloth and every coat and

00:11:39.498 --> 00:11:42.924
boot and hat that we wear,
for our axes,

00:11:42.924 --> 00:11:47.293
scythes, tubs and buckets,
in short for everything except

00:11:47.293 --> 00:11:50.994
our bread and meat,
it must occur to the South that

00:11:50.994 --> 00:11:54.194
if our relations with the North
are ever severed we

00:11:54.194 --> 00:11:57.907
should"--they'd already been
severed--"we should in all the

00:11:57.907 --> 00:12:00.659
South not be able to clothe
ourselves.

00:12:00.659 --> 00:12:03.992
We could not fill our
firesides, plow our fields,

00:12:03.992 --> 00:12:07.474
nor mow our meadows.
In fact, we should be reduced

00:12:07.474 --> 00:12:11.179
to a state more abject than we
are willing to look at,

00:12:11.179 --> 00:12:14.928
even prospectively,
and yet all these things

00:12:14.928 --> 00:12:19.462
staring us in the face,
we shut our eyes and we go in

00:12:19.462 --> 00:12:23.840
blindfold."
Man, was that prescient.

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:26.340
One of the most remarkable
facts about the American Civil

00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:29.063
War--and James McPherson makes a
big deal of this in Battle

00:12:29.063 --> 00:12:32.398
Cry of Freedom,
over and over--is that despite

00:12:32.398 --> 00:12:36.937
their lack of the industrial
productivity in relation to the

00:12:36.937 --> 00:12:39.987
North,
it is amazing how long the

00:12:39.987 --> 00:12:45.156
South held out and amazing how
close they actually came to

00:12:45.156 --> 00:12:49.690
winning their version or
definition of victory.

00:12:49.690 --> 00:12:55.079
The North had more banking,
more labor capacity,

00:12:55.079 --> 00:12:59.158
everything.
Two, an argument has always

00:12:59.158 --> 00:13:04.622
been made that the North in the
end had superior political

00:13:04.622 --> 00:13:08.169
leadership, i.e.,
Abraham Lincoln.

00:13:08.169 --> 00:13:11.924
Now a lot can be made of this,
and a lot has been made of

00:13:11.924 --> 00:13:15.679
this, in book after book
comparing Lincoln with Davis.

00:13:15.679 --> 00:13:18.392
And there's no question that as
an executive,

00:13:18.392 --> 00:13:20.118
as a leader,
as a politician,

00:13:20.118 --> 00:13:24.378
as a manipulator of people,
in terms of an acumen,

00:13:24.378 --> 00:13:28.969
even a genius for politics and
organization,

00:13:28.969 --> 00:13:33.879
Abraham is about as good as
we've ever had.

00:13:33.879 --> 00:13:36.291
Jefferson Davis,
on the other hand,

00:13:36.291 --> 00:13:40.690
smart and brilliant man that he
was, a long military career,

00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:43.870
long service in the Senate,
the War Department and all

00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:46.929
else, was nevertheless not a
very good executive.

00:13:46.929 --> 00:13:52.566
He always had one foot sort of
tied in the States' Rights

00:13:52.566 --> 00:13:56.289
tradition, and that other foot
now,

00:13:56.289 --> 00:14:00.237
really where his soul was by
1862, '63, '64,

00:14:00.237 --> 00:14:03.450
was in trying to create a
nation,

00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:07.457
a centralized nation state,
doing all the things that the

00:14:07.457 --> 00:14:10.750
States' Rights tradition said he
should not.

00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:14.125
He was not in the end a great
war President,

00:14:14.125 --> 00:14:18.600
in part, some have argued,
because he would have preferred

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:23.309
to be on the battlefield and not
in an executive's role.

00:14:23.309 --> 00:14:27.103
He listened to those generals
who were his friends and didn't

00:14:27.103 --> 00:14:29.570
tend to listen to those who were
not.

00:14:29.570 --> 00:14:34.437
He often made sort of
leadership mistakes such as the

00:14:34.437 --> 00:14:39.586
time he personally went out
West--I'll come to that in a

00:14:39.586 --> 00:14:44.615
moment--during the,
just before the great campaign

00:14:44.615 --> 00:14:48.736
for Chattanooga,
in late summer and then the

00:14:48.736 --> 00:14:52.569
fall of 1863,
for the possession of this

00:14:52.569 --> 00:14:57.080
terribly important strategic
crossroads in southeast

00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:59.623
Tennessee,
to the gateway into the Deep

00:14:59.623 --> 00:15:02.210
South, the crossroads of two
great southern rivers,

00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:05.983
the crossroads of the two main
east/west southern railroads and

00:15:05.983 --> 00:15:08.204
so on.
He goes out there in the wake

00:15:08.204 --> 00:15:11.553
of the fall of Chattanooga,
when Braxton Bragg's army had

00:15:11.553 --> 00:15:13.975
to retreat south,
and he goes to the

00:15:13.975 --> 00:15:17.925
whole--there'd been terrible
dissention in that Confederate

00:15:17.925 --> 00:15:20.556
Army.
All the generals wanted Bragg

00:15:20.556 --> 00:15:24.153
fired and Davis goes out
personally to the camp and

00:15:24.153 --> 00:15:26.960
gathers all the generals around
him,

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:30.286
with Bragg standing there,
and asked all the other

00:15:30.286 --> 00:15:33.749
generals whether they thought
they should have a new

00:15:33.749 --> 00:15:36.439
commander.
And to a man they basically all

00:15:36.439 --> 00:15:38.740
said "yes," in front of their
commander.

00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:43.348
And then Davis re-appointed him.
It was one of the most bizarre

00:15:43.348 --> 00:15:46.639
decisions of the war.
Bragg was a disaster.

00:15:46.639 --> 00:15:50.149
But this is the sort of thing
that--and Davis and Bragg went

00:15:50.149 --> 00:15:52.470
back years and they were old
friends.

00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:55.149
And Davis made some strange
decisions.

00:15:55.149 --> 00:15:57.588
But Davis also was handicapped
tremendously,

00:15:57.588 --> 00:15:59.516
politically,
by this States' Rights

00:15:59.516 --> 00:16:01.620
tradition.
And I would argue one other

00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:03.348
thing;
and it's really a third reason

00:16:03.348 --> 00:16:06.124
you can put on this long list of
why the North's going to win

00:16:06.124 --> 00:16:06.680
this war.

00:16:10.019 --> 00:16:13.464
The North had an existing
political culture,

00:16:13.464 --> 00:16:16.990
it had an existing political
party system.

00:16:16.990 --> 00:16:20.116
Now we can argue that that
political party system was

00:16:20.116 --> 00:16:21.919
greatly divided,
and it was.

00:16:21.919 --> 00:16:26.039
By '63 you've got what are
called Peace Democrats.

00:16:26.039 --> 00:16:29.259
The Democratic Party in the
North is beginning to argue for

00:16:29.259 --> 00:16:31.480
a negotiated peace,
an end to the war;

00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:34.204
a divided America,
a Confederate States of America

00:16:34.204 --> 00:16:37.621
and a United States of America.
And in 1864 they're going to

00:16:37.621 --> 00:16:40.501
run McClellan on that
platform--and we'll talk about

00:16:40.501 --> 00:16:43.100
how pivotal the '64 Election was
next week.

00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:46.782
But you had an existing party
system that could organize

00:16:46.782 --> 00:16:49.460
politics, that could organize
dissent,

00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:54.650
that could channel opposition,
and it also gave Abraham

00:16:54.650 --> 00:16:59.360
Lincoln the cudgel or the whip
of partisanship.

00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:03.170
He could build enough of a
coalition to sustain not only

00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:07.189
the war effort but also to pull
off some of that remarkable

00:17:07.189 --> 00:17:11.000
legislation that I started to
talk about last time,

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.686
especially economic
legislation, that really in some

00:17:14.686 --> 00:17:19.540
ways, for awhile at least,
transformed the American

00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:24.188
central government.
Fourth, one of the principle

00:17:24.188 --> 00:17:28.765
reasons the North's going to win
this war is that it does

00:17:28.765 --> 00:17:31.434
ultimately,
through some remarkable

00:17:31.434 --> 00:17:35.279
diplomacy--especially by Charles
Francis Adams in London,

00:17:35.279 --> 00:17:38.542
the U.S.
Ambassador to Great Britain,

00:17:38.542 --> 00:17:43.165
grandson of John Adams,
son of John Quincy--the fact

00:17:43.165 --> 00:17:48.150
that in the end the Union
government succeeds in keeping

00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:52.319
Great Britain ostensibly out of
the war,

00:17:52.319 --> 00:17:55.678
at least militarily,
mostly, out of the war,

00:17:55.678 --> 00:17:58.880
is absolutely crucial to Union
victory.

00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:02.021
Had Britain--had Lee won at
Antietam--and this is what

00:18:02.021 --> 00:18:04.747
McPherson means,
and many other historians were

00:18:04.747 --> 00:18:06.940
really doing this before Jim
was,

00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:09.448
but he's made it his own
argument--that you can't

00:18:09.448 --> 00:18:12.270
understand Union victory and
Confederate defeat without

00:18:12.270 --> 00:18:14.570
dealing with all kinds of
contingencies,

00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:18.365
moments in the war.
If this hadn't happened then,

00:18:18.365 --> 00:18:20.075
that can't happen;
if that doesn't happen then,

00:18:20.075 --> 00:18:22.527
that can't happen.
And so putting your eggs in any

00:18:22.527 --> 00:18:25.832
one basket to explain this,
or for that matter anything in

00:18:25.832 --> 00:18:29.318
history, is a bad idea.
But one of those contingencies

00:18:29.318 --> 00:18:33.142
is if Lee wins at Antietam,
succeeds in moving further into

00:18:33.142 --> 00:18:35.729
the North,
threatens Northern cities,

00:18:35.729 --> 00:18:38.988
and the British government
formally recognized the

00:18:38.988 --> 00:18:43.044
Confederacy and formally sent
British troops to fight with the

00:18:43.044 --> 00:18:47.101
Confederacy--rather than just in
a sense sending them a shadow

00:18:47.101 --> 00:18:49.215
navy,
which was helping the

00:18:49.215 --> 00:18:52.722
Confederacy, and building them
ships--could've had a very

00:18:52.722 --> 00:18:58.120
different outcome to this war.
If the United States had had to

00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:03.707
fight a second front,
in Canada, against the British,

00:19:03.707 --> 00:19:07.790
just imagine the possible
outcomes.

00:19:07.790 --> 00:19:14.199
So, a very important factor.
Fifth, much has always been

00:19:14.199 --> 00:19:19.297
made about the so called,
in the end, superior military

00:19:19.297 --> 00:19:22.980
leadership of the North,
in the end.

00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:26.521
And we'll deal with this much
more next week,

00:19:26.521 --> 00:19:30.465
and a little bit today,
when Grant and Sherman and

00:19:30.465 --> 00:19:35.295
Sheridan and General Thomas and
a few others actually finally

00:19:35.295 --> 00:19:39.319
become the principal leaders of
this entire,

00:19:39.319 --> 00:19:44.187
ultimately coordinated West and
East strategic effort against

00:19:44.187 --> 00:19:48.243
the South, you can
argue--although I think too much

00:19:48.243 --> 00:19:53.029
is often made of this--you can
argue that in some ways Grant

00:19:53.029 --> 00:19:57.306
won the war.
There are books that literally

00:19:57.306 --> 00:20:03.033
argue that, that want to give
Grant in so many ways credit for

00:20:03.033 --> 00:20:06.550
Union victory,
and that will argue--and I'll

00:20:06.550 --> 00:20:09.730
come back to this next
week--that in some ways,

00:20:09.730 --> 00:20:12.760
as great as Robert E.
Lee was as a battlefield

00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:16.599
commander, as daring as he was,
the risks that he took,

00:20:16.599 --> 00:20:20.286
the ability he had to somehow
see a terrain,

00:20:20.286 --> 00:20:23.800
to see land,
to see the possibilities of a

00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:29.029
landscape and how to move huge
numbers of men through it,

00:20:29.029 --> 00:20:32.925
and the way that he could
inspire through a quite amazing

00:20:32.925 --> 00:20:37.168
level of charisma his officer
staff--there's a lot to the fact

00:20:37.168 --> 00:20:40.020
that Robert E.
Lee himself had a lot to do

00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:44.890
with sustaining the Confederate
war effort as long as it lasted.

00:20:44.890 --> 00:20:48.168
And Gary Gallagher's going to
make a pretty big deal of that

00:20:48.168 --> 00:20:50.279
in your book Confederate
War.

00:20:50.279 --> 00:20:55.179
It's just worth remembering
that Gallagher's source set by

00:20:55.179 --> 00:20:59.220
and large is the officer corps
of Lee's army.

00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:04.905
It's a fine book but you got to
remember where his sources are

00:21:04.905 --> 00:21:07.961
coming from.
These are Lee's lieutenants

00:21:07.961 --> 00:21:11.981
that he's quoting over and over
and over, and they become about

00:21:11.981 --> 00:21:15.743
as loyal to a military commander
as anyone has ever been in

00:21:15.743 --> 00:21:18.268
American history.
And then sixth,

00:21:18.268 --> 00:21:22.517
or whatever number I'm on--and
we've dealt with this a good

00:21:22.517 --> 00:21:25.415
deal already,
we'll come back to it

00:21:25.415 --> 00:21:28.126
later--the policy of
emancipation,

00:21:28.126 --> 00:21:32.891
the transformation of this war
into far beyond its original

00:21:32.891 --> 00:21:36.677
limited aims,
into a war that will become a

00:21:36.677 --> 00:21:39.840
war of conquest.
A war, as Lincoln comes to

00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:43.322
define it in late '62,
and it's absolutely clear in

00:21:43.322 --> 00:21:46.344
'63,
has to be a war to the ultimate

00:21:46.344 --> 00:21:50.349
aim of the unconditional
surrender of the South,

00:21:50.349 --> 00:21:54.485
which means a war on their
resources, on their society,

00:21:54.485 --> 00:21:57.089
on their transportation
systems,

00:21:57.089 --> 00:22:03.066
and on slavery--their labor
system, their greatest source of

00:22:03.066 --> 00:22:08.869
wealth--and war on their cities,
the people;

00:22:08.869 --> 00:22:13.350
or as Sherman will say,
he wanted to make Georgia howl.

00:22:17.150 --> 00:22:20.660
All right, now that's a short
list.

00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:25.753
Now fold into that this
theory--it's a theory--that in

00:22:25.753 --> 00:22:29.789
the end, you add all this
up--resources,

00:22:29.789 --> 00:22:31.556
political leadership,
military leadership,

00:22:31.556 --> 00:22:33.279
the policy of unconditional
surrender,

00:22:33.279 --> 00:22:35.634
emancipation,
keeping Great Britain out of

00:22:35.634 --> 00:22:37.990
the war, diplomacy and so on and
so on,

00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:41.121
and battlefield victories,
as I'll point out in a

00:22:41.121 --> 00:22:44.710
second--you get this argument
for the loss of morale,

00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:48.656
loss of will.
Now, this was fashioned by

00:22:48.656 --> 00:22:52.710
historians really who cut their
teeth on the Vietnam Era.

00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:56.074
And they argue that there are
plenty of examples throughout

00:22:56.074 --> 00:22:59.960
history of insurgencies like the
Confederacy--that's what it was,

00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:03.340
it's a big one,
it's not just a little guerilla

00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:07.455
army pecking away at oil
lines--but they argue that there

00:23:07.455 --> 00:23:12.263
are many cases in history.
And the most obvious one in the

00:23:12.263 --> 00:23:16.210
1970s and '80s to Americans was
North Vietnam,

00:23:16.210 --> 00:23:19.342
which held out for a
generation, really two

00:23:19.342 --> 00:23:23.667
generations, against the French
Empire and then against the

00:23:23.667 --> 00:23:27.483
United States of America,
the biggest military machine in

00:23:27.483 --> 00:23:31.203
the world.
They lost three and half

00:23:31.203 --> 00:23:35.119
million people,
and they won.

00:23:35.119 --> 00:23:38.114
So suddenly through that
experience, through those eyes,

00:23:38.114 --> 00:23:41.325
some American historians began
to look back at the Civil War

00:23:41.325 --> 00:23:44.834
and say, "You know what?
Well wait a minute here,

00:23:44.834 --> 00:23:48.970
why didn't the Confederacy hold
out even longer?"

00:23:48.970 --> 00:23:52.250
Yes, there were bread riots,
there was some starvation,

00:23:52.250 --> 00:23:55.591
there was a hell of a lot of
desertion, but maybe that's

00:23:55.591 --> 00:23:59.460
telling us something.
That in the end it wasn't just

00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:04.319
Marse Robert and his loyal men,
it was the civilians behind the

00:24:04.319 --> 00:24:09.024
war, it was the home front.
This is what Drew Faust went to

00:24:09.024 --> 00:24:13.353
all these women's diaries to try
to test, and the argument

00:24:13.353 --> 00:24:17.910
essentially is that the South
didn't have a sufficient degree

00:24:17.910 --> 00:24:23.263
of nationalism,
of an emotional psychological

00:24:23.263 --> 00:24:30.268
devotion to a historic nation
state that they would do

00:24:30.268 --> 00:24:35.426
anything to save and preserve,
in the ways,

00:24:35.426 --> 00:24:39.211
let's say, that the Germans did
to the absolute bitter end

00:24:39.211 --> 00:24:43.063
against the Russians and the
Allies on the Western Front in

00:24:43.063 --> 00:24:46.537
the Second World War.
Beringer and Hattaway love the

00:24:46.537 --> 00:24:49.897
example of Paraguay;
nobody knows anything about the

00:24:49.897 --> 00:24:53.759
story of Paraguay and the way it
held out against Brazil,

00:24:53.759 --> 00:24:56.793
I think it was,
as an early twentieth century

00:24:56.793 --> 00:24:59.221
example.
And there've been other kinds

00:24:59.221 --> 00:25:01.440
of guerrilla insurgencies over
the years.

00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:05.579
At the bottom of this argument
was why didn't more Confederate

00:25:05.579 --> 00:25:09.311
forces, rather than surrender,
go off and form guerrilla

00:25:09.311 --> 00:25:11.969
bands?
Why didn't the American Civil

00:25:11.969 --> 00:25:16.200
War end the way so many civil
wars end--they never quite end?

00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:19.547
A band of twenty men here and
300 there, going off into the

00:25:19.547 --> 00:25:21.740
hills, supplying themselves
somehow,

00:25:21.740 --> 00:25:29.882
forming a kind of alternative
insurgency that never quite

00:25:29.882 --> 00:25:32.213
dies.
You read a lot of lost cause

00:25:32.213 --> 00:25:34.747
literature by the late
nineteenth century and you would

00:25:34.747 --> 00:25:36.530
almost think that is what
happened.

00:25:36.530 --> 00:25:41.264
But it didn't happen.
And Beringer and Hattaway have

00:25:41.264 --> 00:25:44.066
also argued that,
in part, the South,

00:25:44.066 --> 00:25:47.880
once it begins to lose the war
in '63 and '64,

00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:51.401
that it was Southern Unionists
that began to come to the fore,

00:25:51.401 --> 00:25:54.519
that there were large--and
there were--large pockets of

00:25:54.519 --> 00:25:56.505
unionism,
people who didn't really

00:25:56.505 --> 00:25:59.491
support the Confederate war
effort, in western Virginia and

00:25:59.491 --> 00:26:01.907
western North Carolina,
eastern Tennessee,

00:26:01.907 --> 00:26:04.542
upland Georgia,
in those hills that Sherman's

00:26:04.542 --> 00:26:08.075
Army begins to move through and
discovers there's some white

00:26:08.075 --> 00:26:10.529
folk around who want to support
him.

00:26:10.529 --> 00:26:14.192
In fact, Sherman was much
kinder to those Georgia whites

00:26:14.192 --> 00:26:18.188
than he was to those Georgia
blacks who tried to gain freedom

00:26:18.188 --> 00:26:23.085
by coming to his army.
More on Sherman's racism next

00:26:23.085 --> 00:26:25.537
week.
Now, in the end this is an

00:26:25.537 --> 00:26:29.269
argument that what the South
lacked was a deep mystical

00:26:29.269 --> 00:26:33.354
emotional level of nationalism.
Well that's been countered,

00:26:33.354 --> 00:26:36.309
that's been countered by
numerous historians.

00:26:36.309 --> 00:26:38.783
Drew Faust is one of them,
in an earlier book called

00:26:38.783 --> 00:26:41.160
The Creation of Confederate
Nationalism.

00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:45.577
She's been joined,
or she actually joined a whole

00:26:45.577 --> 00:26:49.349
group of historians studying
this idea.

00:26:49.349 --> 00:26:53.840
It's been one of the recurring,
fascinating questions about the

00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:57.751
Civil War, and the question is
essentially what kind of

00:26:57.751 --> 00:27:01.589
nationalism did the Confederacy
actually develop?

00:27:01.589 --> 00:27:03.509
After all, it only lasted four
years.

00:27:03.509 --> 00:27:07.174
The question really is,
was there a confederate nation

00:27:07.174 --> 00:27:10.978
or were they just a band of
states that came together in

00:27:10.978 --> 00:27:15.699
military defense of homeland?
Well there are arguments on all

00:27:15.699 --> 00:27:19.662
sides of this.
And I'll just say a couple of

00:27:19.662 --> 00:27:23.386
things.
I think those--and it's Drew

00:27:23.386 --> 00:27:28.559
Faust, it's John McCardell,
numerous historians.

00:27:28.559 --> 00:27:31.271
The weight of the best
argument, I think,

00:27:31.271 --> 00:27:35.204
is that the South did indeed,
rather quickly--and there's a

00:27:35.204 --> 00:27:38.797
lot of lessons in this
historically--develop a serious

00:27:38.797 --> 00:27:42.119
level of this mystical kind of
nationalism.

00:27:42.119 --> 00:27:46.594
They developed an ideology that
they said their nation was based

00:27:46.594 --> 00:27:47.866
on.
They said right up front,

00:27:47.866 --> 00:27:49.480
at the beginning of the war,
Jefferson Davis,

00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:50.799
speech after speech after
speech,

00:27:50.799 --> 00:27:55.057
he said the Confederacy is the
logical vessel of the American

00:27:55.057 --> 00:27:58.230
Revolution;
what the Confederacy really was

00:27:58.230 --> 00:28:03.819
was the carryover of 1776.
1861 was 1776.

00:28:03.819 --> 00:28:06.293
That George Washington,
they will argue,

00:28:06.293 --> 00:28:08.640
was the founder of the
Confederacy.

00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:13.205
That true American democracy
was in this resistance to

00:28:13.205 --> 00:28:17.132
centralization.
They created seals and songs

00:28:17.132 --> 00:28:20.914
and images and heroes and
paintings, poetry,

00:28:20.914 --> 00:28:24.475
all over the place.
They used religion,

00:28:24.475 --> 00:28:28.069
the same kind of millennial
Christianity.

00:28:28.069 --> 00:28:30.817
The same kind of theory of a
divine providence that

00:28:30.817 --> 00:28:34.168
Northerners are praying to and
arguing for is the same kind of

00:28:34.168 --> 00:28:37.410
millennialism that Confederates
are going to argue for.

00:28:37.410 --> 00:28:39.990
They're going to say that they
are the chosen nation.

00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:46.989
All over the place,
among Southern clergy,

00:28:46.989 --> 00:28:52.010
that argument is put forth,
especially early in the war.

00:28:52.010 --> 00:28:56.338
And then lastly, slavery.
It is in some ways almost

00:28:56.338 --> 00:29:00.487
amazing how much Southerners
began to defend slavery and the

00:29:00.487 --> 00:29:03.089
ways they began to defend
slavery,

00:29:03.089 --> 00:29:05.488
during the war,
and the ways that they began to

00:29:05.488 --> 00:29:07.730
link it to their nation,
the Confederacy,

00:29:07.730 --> 00:29:11.760
of how the Confederacy was put
into this world to perfect

00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:15.098
slavery, to improve it,
to show the world that this

00:29:15.098 --> 00:29:16.580
slave society,
this system,

00:29:16.580 --> 00:29:20.057
this biracial system where one
race is the labor and the other

00:29:20.057 --> 00:29:23.253
race is the educated,
to show the world the

00:29:23.253 --> 00:29:27.829
possibilities of that.
They even developed a whole

00:29:27.829 --> 00:29:32.829
variety of traveling Confederate
minstrel groups.

00:29:32.829 --> 00:29:36.019
Minstrelsy had been primarily a
phenomenon of the North.

00:29:36.019 --> 00:29:39.664
Often the audiences were
largely white working class,

00:29:39.664 --> 00:29:44.008
but during the war suddenly you
had these Confederate troops of

00:29:44.008 --> 00:29:46.623
minstrels,
all over the place,

00:29:46.623 --> 00:29:51.609
and new songs and new poems
were written that were tied now

00:29:51.609 --> 00:29:55.220
to the sort of fate of the
Confederacy.

00:29:55.220 --> 00:29:59.142
I'll just give you one example.
There was one minstrel troop

00:29:59.142 --> 00:30:03.680
known as--these were whites in
blackface, keeping morale up.

00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:07.470
One of them was called
Lincoln's Intelligent

00:30:07.470 --> 00:30:12.582
Contrabands, and one little
verse ran: "I'd rather work the

00:30:12.582 --> 00:30:17.871
cotton patch and dine on corn
and bacon than live up North on

00:30:17.871 --> 00:30:21.750
good white bread of abolition
makin'."

00:30:21.750 --> 00:30:26.190
And it gets worse and it goes
on and on.

00:30:26.190 --> 00:30:29.523
And the story or the argument
of all these Confederate

00:30:29.523 --> 00:30:33.234
minstrel songs and the poetry
they're based on is that black

00:30:33.234 --> 00:30:37.188
people don't want to be free.
They don't want anything to do

00:30:37.188 --> 00:30:40.821
with this free labor nonsense,
they want to stay where they

00:30:40.821 --> 00:30:43.871
are.
Now, I invite you to read

00:30:43.871 --> 00:30:49.052
Gallagher and Faust on this.
And Gallagher's going to make a

00:30:49.052 --> 00:30:53.220
pretty aggressive argument
against the loss of will thesis,

00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:56.842
and he's going to argue that
Confederate nationalism

00:30:56.842 --> 00:30:59.470
ultimately resided in those
armies,

00:30:59.470 --> 00:31:05.848
the armies that stuck it out
against almost unbelievable

00:31:05.848 --> 00:31:10.596
odds.
All right, but in 1863 the war

00:31:10.596 --> 00:31:15.190
had major military turning
points.

00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:17.721
And let me take you through
some of that,

00:31:17.721 --> 00:31:20.759
well the three major ones,
with some dispatch.

00:31:20.759 --> 00:31:24.191
But these are,
on that short list of I believe

00:31:24.191 --> 00:31:28.308
five major turning points in the
Civil War, I mentioned

00:31:28.308 --> 00:31:32.077
Gettysburg and Vicksburg.
Well, kind of add to that,

00:31:32.077 --> 00:31:34.294
if you would,
the fall of Port Hudson,

00:31:34.294 --> 00:31:37.529
only a week after Vicksburg out
on the Mississippi,

00:31:37.529 --> 00:31:43.073
and then the ultimate fall,
final fall of Chattanooga to

00:31:43.073 --> 00:31:50.160
Union hands by the fall of 1863.
Now, some maps are in order.

00:31:56.460 --> 00:32:04.317
The Confederacy won a major
victory at the Battle of

00:32:04.317 --> 00:32:13.714
Chancellorsville near----just
west of Fredericksburg the first

00:32:13.714 --> 00:32:19.066
week of May 1863.
This was yet again--you'll

00:32:19.066 --> 00:32:22.078
remember the whole,
the previous year,

00:32:22.078 --> 00:32:25.207
a year before this,
McClellan had invaded the

00:32:25.207 --> 00:32:28.417
peninsula up toward Richmond,
the Seven Days Campaign and all

00:32:28.417 --> 00:32:31.620
the rest,
defeated, retreated.

00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:35.810
Lee then invaded the North.
He's going to do exactly the

00:32:35.810 --> 00:32:39.032
same thing in the summer of
1863, in the wake of what was

00:32:39.032 --> 00:32:40.715
truly,
without a question,

00:32:40.715 --> 00:32:43.170
a decisive victory at
Chancellorsville.

00:32:43.170 --> 00:32:47.822
Lee held a Council of War in
Richmond with Davis and other

00:32:47.822 --> 00:32:49.944
generals.
This time, of course,

00:32:49.944 --> 00:32:51.869
Stonewall Jackson was not
there;

00:32:51.869 --> 00:32:56.156
he was shot and killed by his
own men, after the battle,

00:32:56.156 --> 00:33:00.029
at night, of Chancellorsville.
He lived about a week.

00:33:00.029 --> 00:33:03.766
That little house where he died
and they amputated his arm is a

00:33:03.766 --> 00:33:06.692
shrine today.
If you want to see some Civil

00:33:06.692 --> 00:33:10.180
War weirdness go to the
Stonewall Jackson shrine.

00:33:10.180 --> 00:33:14.337
And if you ever saw the movie,
if you ever endured the movie

00:33:14.337 --> 00:33:16.771
Gods and Generals,
all 4½

00:33:16.771 --> 00:33:18.408
hours of it,
which I did because I had to

00:33:18.408 --> 00:33:21.563
write a review of it,
you know that they took almost

00:33:21.563 --> 00:33:24.680
a half hour to have Stonewall
Jackson die.

00:33:28.630 --> 00:33:30.264
[Laughter]
I'm sorry, for those of you who

00:33:30.264 --> 00:33:32.880
are Stonewall Jackson fans.
It's just quite remarkable.

00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:34.846
But at any rate,
Lee lost a terribly important

00:33:34.846 --> 00:33:36.900
commander then,
there's no question about it,

00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:40.169
and it will always live in
Southern lore--what if Jackson

00:33:40.169 --> 00:33:42.248
had lived?
Or what if he'd had Jackson at

00:33:42.248 --> 00:33:44.852
Gettysburg?
What if he'd had Jackson at

00:33:44.852 --> 00:33:47.472
Cold Harbor, wherever?
At any rate,

00:33:47.472 --> 00:33:51.182
Lee went to Davis and said,
"Let me invade the North

00:33:51.182 --> 00:33:53.379
again."
Davis was a little cautious

00:33:53.379 --> 00:33:56.808
because the first time it didn't
work and he almost lost the war

00:33:56.808 --> 00:33:58.604
a year ago.
James Longstreet,

00:33:58.604 --> 00:34:02.315
now second-in-command to Lee in
the Army of Northern Virginia,

00:34:02.315 --> 00:34:05.052
had another idea,
and Longstreet almost always

00:34:05.052 --> 00:34:07.120
did.
And there's a whole debate in

00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:10.372
Civil War military history about
just whether Longstreet should

00:34:10.372 --> 00:34:12.469
have been listened to throughout
'63.

00:34:12.469 --> 00:34:16.051
Longstreet's idea was to take
at least two divisions,

00:34:16.051 --> 00:34:18.599
if not an entire corps of
infantry,

00:34:18.599 --> 00:34:21.385
as many as possible--20,000
men--and move them out West,

00:34:21.385 --> 00:34:24.424
because Longstreet worried that
the war was being lost in the

00:34:24.424 --> 00:34:25.820
West.
And you know what?

00:34:25.820 --> 00:34:29.010
He was right on that.
But Lee said no.

00:34:29.010 --> 00:34:31.829
And always in Civil War
scholarship there's been this

00:34:31.829 --> 00:34:34.811
question, did Lee ultimately
lose the war because of his

00:34:34.811 --> 00:34:37.619
obsession with Virginia,
his home state,

00:34:37.619 --> 00:34:41.058
his homeland,
in not allowing Confederate

00:34:41.058 --> 00:34:44.503
troops to be moved West?
Well they weren't moved West,

00:34:44.503 --> 00:34:47.408
not at this point in time.
All over the war now,

00:34:47.408 --> 00:34:51.303
even though Lee had won this
major victory at

00:34:51.303 --> 00:34:55.551
Chancellorsville,
the Confederacy was potentially

00:34:55.551 --> 00:35:00.516
hemmed in, potentially.
So Lee's response to this was

00:35:00.516 --> 00:35:04.717
daring, and had he won at
Gettysburg decisively we

00:35:04.717 --> 00:35:09.090
wouldn't be--well I don't what
we'd be debating;

00:35:09.090 --> 00:35:12.070
I'm not sure I want to know
what we'd be debating.

00:35:12.070 --> 00:35:14.932
But Lee did decide to go West,
up over into the Upper

00:35:14.932 --> 00:35:17.904
Shenandoah Valley and invade
this time all the way into

00:35:17.904 --> 00:35:23.769
Pennsylvania,
which he did in June, 1863.

00:35:23.769 --> 00:35:29.536
Lincoln's Commander of the Army
of the Potomac,

00:35:29.536 --> 00:35:36.179
now seriously defeated,
was a general named Hooker.

00:35:36.179 --> 00:35:40.240
Hooker resigned on the 28^(th)
of June 1863 and was replaced by

00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:42.730
a general named George Gordon
Meade,

00:35:42.730 --> 00:35:48.556
only three days before what
would become the greatest battle

00:35:48.556 --> 00:35:55.044
of the war.
What Gettysburg became was in

00:35:55.044 --> 00:36:05.272
some ways an attempt by the
Union armies----it's an effort

00:36:05.272 --> 00:36:10.954
by the Union armies,
blue here, of course,

00:36:10.954 --> 00:36:14.655
to catch up with Lee's army as
they invaded up into

00:36:14.655 --> 00:36:18.197
Pennsylvania,
and to stay between Lee's army

00:36:18.197 --> 00:36:22.077
and Washington DC.
It's in some ways a replay of

00:36:22.077 --> 00:36:25.369
what had happened just the year
before.

00:36:25.369 --> 00:36:28.848
Now, they actually ended up
meeting at this little town of

00:36:28.848 --> 00:36:32.050
Gettysburg almost by mistake;
they hadn't planned that.

00:36:32.050 --> 00:36:34.937
Lee wanted to move all of his
troops into Central

00:36:34.937 --> 00:36:37.692
Pennsylvania.
The whole idea here was to live

00:36:37.692 --> 00:36:40.800
off the land and the rich
farmland of Pennsylvania,

00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:45.225
to take the war out of ravaged
Central Virginia,

00:36:45.225 --> 00:36:48.710
relieve Richmond,
and Lee believed,

00:36:48.710 --> 00:36:53.664
tap into the war weariness of
the North and possibly even

00:36:53.664 --> 00:36:56.849
reinvigorate British
intervention.

00:36:56.849 --> 00:37:00.346
There wasn't a lot of
likelihood at that point,

00:37:00.346 --> 00:37:05.210
but he hoped at any rate that
there might be some possibility.

00:37:05.210 --> 00:37:12.650
It was a great calculated risk.
Had it worked, who knows?

00:37:12.650 --> 00:37:16.042
It did not.
They collided near Gettysburg

00:37:16.042 --> 00:37:20.055
because a group of Confederate
infantry were marching toward

00:37:20.055 --> 00:37:24.001
the town from the West on July
1,1863, because they'd heard

00:37:24.001 --> 00:37:28.219
there were shoes in Gettysburg.
And they were confiscating,

00:37:28.219 --> 00:37:32.019
by the way, everything--cattle,
hogs, food, everything they

00:37:32.019 --> 00:37:34.510
could take from Pennsylvania
farms.

00:37:34.510 --> 00:37:38.809
And rather than tapping into
war weariness in the North,

00:37:38.809 --> 00:37:43.108
what Lee accomplished was to
stimulate resistance in the

00:37:43.108 --> 00:37:45.993
North.
Nothing like an army invading

00:37:45.993 --> 00:37:49.766
your land and stealing your
animals to cause you some

00:37:49.766 --> 00:37:53.482
consternation.
Lee's army also took scores of

00:37:53.482 --> 00:37:58.117
free blacks, living in southern
and central Pennsylvania,

00:37:58.117 --> 00:38:03.000
and shuttled them quickly back
into the South as slaves.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:08.418
And when this got into the
press it also had an effect on

00:38:08.418 --> 00:38:11.116
Northern morale.
The first day at

00:38:11.116 --> 00:38:14.761
Gettysburg--and I can't go into
the kind of detail I'd love to

00:38:14.761 --> 00:38:16.638
here,
and I know some of you would

00:38:16.638 --> 00:38:19.633
like me to, although I'm going
to invite those of you who are

00:38:19.633 --> 00:38:22.329
military history enthusiasts to
an evening session,

00:38:22.329 --> 00:38:24.692
perhaps next week,
perhaps the week after,

00:38:24.692 --> 00:38:26.710
on a Wednesday,
if anybody wants,

00:38:26.710 --> 00:38:29.717
where we can go into more
detail on this and you can open

00:38:29.717 --> 00:38:32.940
your veins and get a really good
shot of military history,

00:38:32.940 --> 00:38:34.655
if you'd like.
[Laughter]

00:38:34.655 --> 00:38:38.650
And if you OD,
that's your fault.

00:38:38.650 --> 00:38:42.631
The first day at Gettysburg was
a Confederate victory,

00:38:42.631 --> 00:38:46.630
almost a complete rout.
It's actually nighttime that

00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:49.186
stopped it.
The second day at Gettysburg,

00:38:49.186 --> 00:38:52.591
if you look at this map over
here, you'll note that the Union

00:38:52.591 --> 00:38:55.769
battle line--the Union Army
barely got there in time,

00:38:55.769 --> 00:38:59.440
by the second day,
to actually oppose Lee's Army.

00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:02.746
They had marched all day.
Some of these Union troops had

00:39:02.746 --> 00:39:05.440
marched 30 miles in a day just
to get there.

00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:09.480
But the second day at
Gettysburg were attacks,

00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:13.699
massive attacks,
on the two ends of the line,

00:39:13.699 --> 00:39:16.102
the left flank and the right
flank of the Union armies,

00:39:16.102 --> 00:39:17.659
which were both very high
ground.

00:39:17.659 --> 00:39:19.960
How many of you have been to
Gettysburg?

00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:24.530
You know Little Round Top and
Culp's Hill then--large hills.

00:39:24.530 --> 00:39:29.269
Huge battles were fought on
those hills on July 2,1862,

00:39:29.269 --> 00:39:33.657
with huge numbers of
casualties, especially for the

00:39:33.657 --> 00:39:37.086
Confederates.
By the third day,

00:39:37.086 --> 00:39:42.099
Longstreet urged vehemently
that Lee retreat,

00:39:42.099 --> 00:39:45.917
a strategic retreat,
and move south,

00:39:45.917 --> 00:39:50.548
southward, and then toward
Washington and threaten the U.S.

00:39:50.548 --> 00:39:55.099
capital, but to choose other
ground to fight on because of

00:39:55.099 --> 00:40:00.289
the way these hills and ridges
were set up in front of them.

00:40:00.289 --> 00:40:06.559
Longstreet counseled a kind of
strategic defensive move.

00:40:06.559 --> 00:40:09.210
They are on enemy's land,
enemy territory.

00:40:09.210 --> 00:40:14.976
Every day is a total risk here,
and they've got a real problem

00:40:14.976 --> 00:40:18.506
with their supply line.
But Lee said no,

00:40:18.506 --> 00:40:21.858
his blood was up,
and there's evidence all over

00:40:21.858 --> 00:40:24.700
the dispatches,
Lee wanted to win there,

00:40:24.700 --> 00:40:28.614
he wanted to fight.
And I'll come back to this

00:40:28.614 --> 00:40:33.775
question next week about Lee's
own psyche for war and what they

00:40:33.775 --> 00:40:38.519
said happened to his eyes when
it was time for battle.

00:40:38.519 --> 00:40:42.122
So, on the third day at
Gettysburg he ordered a

00:40:42.122 --> 00:40:46.898
concentration at the center and
it became the largest military

00:40:46.898 --> 00:40:50.162
assault of the war,
the largest infantry assault of

00:40:50.162 --> 00:40:52.946
the Civil War.
It's known as Pickett's Charge

00:40:52.946 --> 00:40:56.960
because it's named for one of
the three Division Commanders

00:40:56.960 --> 00:40:59.929
who led it,
George Pickett--who hid behind

00:40:59.929 --> 00:41:03.927
a barn through the whole damn
thing, by the way--while two of

00:41:03.927 --> 00:41:06.460
his brigade commanders were
killed,

00:41:06.460 --> 00:41:10.561
and all of the thirteen
colonels in his brigade were

00:41:10.561 --> 00:41:13.509
killed or wounded.
So Pickett's Charge,

00:41:13.509 --> 00:41:16.054
the charge of 13,000 men,
for one hour,

00:41:16.054 --> 00:41:20.311
across a wide open field,
slightly rising toward a ridge,

00:41:20.311 --> 00:41:24.305
lasted about one hour,
and almost exactly one-half of

00:41:24.305 --> 00:41:28.914
those 13,000 men were killed or
wounded and never got back to

00:41:28.914 --> 00:41:33.399
the ridge they started from.
It was Lee's greatest mistake

00:41:33.399 --> 00:41:35.599
in the Civil War.
He knew it.

00:41:35.599 --> 00:41:38.873
He rode out in the middle of
this field when the thing was

00:41:38.873 --> 00:41:41.170
over, as the men were straggling
back,

00:41:41.170 --> 00:41:43.461
those who survived,
and he kept going up to them

00:41:43.461 --> 00:41:46.344
and saying, "It's all my fault,
it's all my fault,

00:41:46.344 --> 00:41:49.639
it's all my fault.
Please help me."

00:41:49.639 --> 00:41:53.101
He even offered his resignation
to Jefferson Davis a couple of

00:41:53.101 --> 00:41:56.449
weeks later, but of course Davis
wasn't going to take it.

00:41:56.449 --> 00:42:02.388
The great significance of
Gettysburg is many things,

00:42:02.388 --> 00:42:06.877
it's several things.
It's the greatest battle of the

00:42:06.877 --> 00:42:11.449
war in terms of its sheer scale.
Casualties were ghastly;

00:42:11.449 --> 00:42:14.462
28,000 casualties in three
days--that's dead,

00:42:14.462 --> 00:42:17.679
wounded and missing--on the
Confederate side.

00:42:17.679 --> 00:42:20.980
One-third of all the men
engaged were dead or wounded at

00:42:20.980 --> 00:42:24.191
the end of it.
On the Union side there were

00:42:24.191 --> 00:42:29.619
23,000 casualties;
that's one of every four.

00:42:29.619 --> 00:42:32.171
My guy, Charlie Brewster,
whose letters I edited,

00:42:32.171 --> 00:42:35.344
was actually held in reserve.
They didn't even get there in

00:42:35.344 --> 00:42:38.274
time.
The 10^(th) Mass was brought

00:42:38.274 --> 00:42:42.757
out to be burial crews,
and his letters about the

00:42:42.757 --> 00:42:48.360
fields at Gettysburg are just
quite--almost unbelievable.

00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:53.478
There's a particularly poignant
letter where he--they always

00:42:53.478 --> 00:42:58.424
rifled the pockets of the
dead--he rifles the pockets of a

00:42:58.424 --> 00:43:03.630
dead Confederate soldier and in
his pockets is a letter,

00:43:03.630 --> 00:43:07.927
a love letter home.
And he reads that letter and he

00:43:07.927 --> 00:43:10.427
quotes from it,
to his own mother,

00:43:10.427 --> 00:43:14.289
and then he buries the guy and
saved the letter.

00:43:14.289 --> 00:43:18.312
And this was his job for about
three days in a rainstorm,

00:43:18.312 --> 00:43:20.969
burying Union and Confederate
dead.

00:43:20.969 --> 00:43:25.260
It is the carnage at
Gettysburg, the vast number of

00:43:25.260 --> 00:43:28.949
dead, 56-odd-thousand casualties
overall,

00:43:28.949 --> 00:43:31.787
that forced the United States
Government to create to the

00:43:31.787 --> 00:43:34.980
first national cemetery which
would be created at Gettysburg,

00:43:34.980 --> 00:43:38.660
and that's, of course,
why Lincoln went there the next

00:43:38.660 --> 00:43:41.300
fall to give the Gettysburg
Address.

00:43:41.300 --> 00:43:45.360
Now, but strategically it's
hugely important.

00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:48.179
Lee had to retreat as fast as
he could.

00:43:48.179 --> 00:43:51.513
The great problem now for the
next week was whether Meade,

00:43:51.513 --> 00:43:55.084
the Union Commander,
would follow this up and push

00:43:55.084 --> 00:43:59.179
like hell, in spite of how badly
hurt his army was.

00:43:59.179 --> 00:44:01.683
And Lincoln was sending
dispatch after dispatch to

00:44:01.683 --> 00:44:03.624
Meade, "Please move,
you've got them in

00:44:03.624 --> 00:44:05.770
your"--Lincoln was saying things
like,

00:44:05.770 --> 00:44:07.440
"You've got them in your grip.
Destroy them.

00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:10.130
The war will be over,
the war will be over."

00:44:10.130 --> 00:44:17.789
And Meade didn't move for three
days, and Lee's Army escaped on

00:44:17.789 --> 00:44:23.761
the 13^(th) and 14^(th) of July,
on a pontoon bridge they

00:44:23.761 --> 00:44:27.967
hastily managed to build;
what was left of Lee's Army

00:44:27.967 --> 00:44:32.372
managed to get across the
Potomac River and back into

00:44:32.372 --> 00:44:37.150
Virginia to fight again.
Gettysburg's a major Union

00:44:37.150 --> 00:44:41.269
victory, but it could've been
even bigger.

00:44:41.269 --> 00:44:46.858
Out West--and terribly
important, you could argue even

00:44:46.858 --> 00:44:53.080
more important--were the sieges
and the capture of two major

00:44:53.080 --> 00:44:56.494
places,
I guess you'd call them

00:44:56.494 --> 00:45:01.197
fortresses or ports,
along the Mississippi River,

00:45:01.197 --> 00:45:05.533
Vicksburg and Port Hudson.
Vicksburg was laid under

00:45:05.533 --> 00:45:08.955
siege--Vicksburg had been
brought under siege for months

00:45:08.955 --> 00:45:11.880
by a Union Army Commander,
by Ulysses Grant.

00:45:11.880 --> 00:45:16.133
They had even at one point
tried to alter the course of the

00:45:16.133 --> 00:45:19.280
Mississippi River,
with the biggest military

00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:22.440
engineering scheme the world had
ever hatched.

00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:26.345
And it didn't really work.
That's a big river -- don't

00:45:26.345 --> 00:45:29.761
mess with it.
But finally Grant was able to

00:45:29.761 --> 00:45:32.915
put Vicksburg,
in the spring of 1863,

00:45:32.915 --> 00:45:36.074
under siege,
mostly from the east,

00:45:36.074 --> 00:45:41.258
and it was especially under
complete lockdown siege from May

00:45:41.258 --> 00:45:45.838
22 to the first week of July,
in which time the civilian

00:45:45.838 --> 00:45:49.784
population of Vicksburg that was
left, and a roughly 30,000

00:45:49.784 --> 00:45:53.389
garrison of the Confederate
Army, began to starve.

00:45:53.389 --> 00:45:56.610
The civilians were living in
caves because much of their

00:45:56.610 --> 00:45:59.480
housing was destroyed by
artillery bombardment.

00:45:59.480 --> 00:46:03.990
On June 28 the Confederate
Commander John Pemberton

00:46:03.990 --> 00:46:07.780
received a petition from his own
troops,

00:46:07.780 --> 00:46:11.219
signed by lots of them,
which said in part,

00:46:11.219 --> 00:46:15.969
quote, "If you cannot feed us
you had better surrender."

00:46:15.969 --> 00:46:20.374
And so Pemberton sued for--he
didn't sue--he asked for

00:46:20.374 --> 00:46:24.347
surrender terms.
He met with Grant on the 3^(rd)

00:46:24.347 --> 00:46:29.301
of July, the same afternoon as
Pickett's Charge is happening in

00:46:29.301 --> 00:46:33.616
the East--they don't know
it--and Pemberton surrendered

00:46:33.616 --> 00:46:37.452
30,000 Confederate troops in the
blink of an eye,

00:46:37.452 --> 00:46:39.690
on July 4^(th),
1863.

00:46:39.690 --> 00:46:43.588
Central Mississippi would
within weeks be abandoned by

00:46:43.588 --> 00:46:47.633
Confederate forces and the whole
of central and northern

00:46:47.633 --> 00:46:51.090
Mississippi would come under
Union control.

00:46:51.090 --> 00:46:53.141
And that is,
by the way folks,

00:46:53.141 --> 00:46:56.962
the most densely populated
slave region anywhere in the

00:46:56.962 --> 00:46:59.875
South,
and it is the escape of slaves

00:46:59.875 --> 00:47:04.360
now, by the hundreds and then
thousands, into Grant's lines,

00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:08.030
that forced his hand in the
creation of numerous contraband

00:47:08.030 --> 00:47:11.321
camps all over northern
Mississippi and Tennessee and

00:47:11.321 --> 00:47:14.496
even down the Mississippi.
A few days later,

00:47:14.496 --> 00:47:18.025
on July 8, at Port Hudson,
down the Mississippi,

00:47:18.025 --> 00:47:22.230
just north of Baton Rouge,
a second fort surrendered.

00:47:22.230 --> 00:47:25.829
It too had been under siege
since May.

00:47:25.829 --> 00:47:28.972
And when Port Hudson
surrendered, the Mississippi

00:47:28.972 --> 00:47:32.900
River now was completely in
Union hands and Union control.

00:47:32.900 --> 00:47:36.904
On the 16^(th) of July a
merchant steamboat tied up in

00:47:36.904 --> 00:47:40.606
New Orleans, having successfully
traveled from St.

00:47:40.606 --> 00:47:44.459
Louis all the way down the
river, unharassed at all,

00:47:44.459 --> 00:47:48.236
by Confederate guns,
and Lincoln famously wrote his

00:47:48.236 --> 00:47:51.409
memo or telegraph to Grant
saying,

00:47:51.409 --> 00:47:57.139
"Now the father of waters again
goes unvexed to the sea."

00:47:57.139 --> 00:48:00.659
It's terribly important because
if you just look at a map you

00:48:00.659 --> 00:48:04.413
realize now, that by controlling
the entire Mississippi River and

00:48:04.413 --> 00:48:08.484
the region around it,
you not only are sowing havoc

00:48:08.484 --> 00:48:11.806
into Southern society,
freeing slaves,

00:48:11.806 --> 00:48:16.444
confiscating land and property,
controlling the South's

00:48:16.444 --> 00:48:19.752
greatest seaports,
but you've cut the Confederacy

00:48:19.752 --> 00:48:22.354
in half.
And one of the Confederacy's

00:48:22.354 --> 00:48:24.989
largest supply lines was through
Texas.

00:48:24.989 --> 00:48:28.119
They were actually being
supported, to this point in

00:48:28.119 --> 00:48:30.389
time, by the French through
Mexico;

00:48:30.389 --> 00:48:33.849
well, that was a supply line
that never worked terribly well.

00:48:33.849 --> 00:48:37.159
Now, the clock is running out
on me.

00:48:37.159 --> 00:48:40.682
That's okay because what
happens at Chattanooga doesn't

00:48:40.682 --> 00:48:44.595
happen--that's the end of 1863,
which is a nice place to pick

00:48:44.595 --> 00:48:47.080
it up next time.
But let me leave you with this.

00:48:55.960 --> 00:48:59.000
Across the South this was
horrible news,

00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:02.821
and especially when
Chattanooga's going to fall in

00:49:02.821 --> 00:49:07.515
the fall, it's even worse news.
And these kinds of expressions

00:49:07.515 --> 00:49:11.316
now came from Southern leaders
and privates in the Army and

00:49:11.316 --> 00:49:14.782
women at home.
And here comes your loss of

00:49:14.782 --> 00:49:17.656
morale thesis.
On July 28^(th),

00:49:17.656 --> 00:49:23.630
after the fall of Port Hudson
and Vicksburg and the debacle,

00:49:23.630 --> 00:49:26.537
the disaster at Gettysburg,
the Confederate

00:49:26.537 --> 00:49:29.030
Chief-of-Ordinance,
Josiah Gorgas,

00:49:29.030 --> 00:49:33.769
wrote into his diary.
Quote: "Events have succeeded

00:49:33.769 --> 00:49:36.769
one another with disastrous
rapidity.

00:49:36.769 --> 00:49:40.496
One brief month ago we were
apparently at the point of

00:49:40.496 --> 00:49:42.746
success.
Lee was in Pennsylvania

00:49:42.746 --> 00:49:45.840
threatening Harrisburg and even
Philadelphia.

00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:50.219
Vicksburg seemed to laugh at
all of Grant's efforts to scorn.

00:49:50.219 --> 00:49:54.469
Now the picture is just as
somber as it was bright then.

00:49:54.469 --> 00:49:59.046
It seems incredible that human
power could effect such a change

00:49:59.046 --> 00:50:02.531
in so brief a space.
Yesterday we rode on the

00:50:02.531 --> 00:50:06.618
pinnacle of success.
Today absolute ruin seems to be

00:50:06.618 --> 00:50:11.031
our portion.
The Confederacy totters to its

00:50:11.031 --> 00:50:15.119
destruction."
The war isn't over.

00:50:15.119 --> 00:50:19.823
And I'll argue next week the
Confederacy still could have won

00:50:19.823 --> 00:50:26.781
its version of victory in 1864.
But those battlefield successes

00:50:26.781 --> 00:50:32.000
of '63 were handwriting on the
wall.

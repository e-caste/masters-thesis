00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:06.147
Professor Langdon
Hammer: Crane is a

00:00:06.147 --> 00:00:09.360
challenge.
He's a challenge for you;

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.880
he's a challenge for me as a
teacher.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.510
He's a challenging poet.
 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:17.830
He challenges his reader.
 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:26.360
He challenges us and he makes
invitations to us.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:37.380
He calls to us in various ways,
places demands on us.

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.998
I'd like to talk about a text
I'm not, in fact,

00:00:42.998 --> 00:00:46.585
holding.
Does somebody have an RIS

00:00:46.585 --> 00:00:50.750
packet handy that I could have
in my hands?

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:56.231
Thank you, Jean.
And that is the poem "Legend,"

00:00:56.231 --> 00:01:05.615
which is the poem placed first
in Crane's first and only book

00:01:05.615 --> 00:01:12.340
of lyrics called White
Buildings.

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.191
It's a poem that he used to
introduce himself to the reader,

00:01:16.191 --> 00:01:20.742
as it were.
So, why don't we use it to

00:01:20.742 --> 00:01:28.907
begin thinking about his work:
As silent as a mirror is

00:01:28.907 --> 00:01:32.759
believed
Realities plunge in silence

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:38.920
by...
The poem begins with a kind of

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:46.808
riddle or enigma,
and then the first person comes

00:01:46.808 --> 00:01:50.239
forward:
I am not ready for

00:01:50.239 --> 00:01:54.880
repentance;
Nor to match regrets.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.400
For the moth
Bends no more than the still

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:04.163
Imploring flame.
It's a wonderful idea:

00:02:04.163 --> 00:02:09.039
"I'm not going to repent of
anything;

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.449
I'm not going to regret
anything.

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:19.593
I have not bent any more,
I have nothing more to regret

00:02:19.593 --> 00:02:28.190
than the flame which has drawn
me, which bent as well."

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.710
For the moth
Bends no more than the still

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:33.900
Imploring flame.
And tremorous

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:42.039
In the white falling flakes
Kisses are,--[comma, dash]

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:43.340
The only worth all
granting.

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.389
 
 

00:02:46.389 --> 00:02:52.889
Characteristically here,
for Crane, there's a compressed

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:54.780
set of images.
 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.740
 
 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:04.169
Those "tremorous white falling
flakes" there;

00:03:04.169 --> 00:03:06.990
well, they're almost images,
aren't they,

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:10.304
of a burnt moth,
a moth that's been drawn to the

00:03:10.304 --> 00:03:15.466
flame.
And then those come to be seen

00:03:15.466 --> 00:03:18.139
as, here, kisses.
 

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:22.339
Kisses, if we unpack Crane's
odd syntax, it would seem--the

00:03:22.339 --> 00:03:26.900
sentence would seem to read –
although it's maybe available to

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.027
other constructions – "kisses
are tremorous in the white

00:03:31.027 --> 00:03:35.151
falling flakes."
But these kisses,

00:03:35.151 --> 00:03:42.448
these kisses that are also
emblems of flame and of

00:03:42.448 --> 00:03:48.256
extinction even,
are "the only worth all

00:03:48.256 --> 00:03:53.825
granting";
that is, the only value that

00:03:53.825 --> 00:03:57.280
seems to grant all,
I think.

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.310
Again those words,
"all granting," might be

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:07.340
construed in a couple of
different ways.

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:12.061
Crane says:
It is to be learned [what

00:04:12.061 --> 00:04:16.457
is to be learned?]--
This cleaving and this burning

00:04:16.457 --> 00:04:19.329
[the kind I'm talking
about]…

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:27.090
We must learn to be drawn to
the flame and we must learn to

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:34.718
recover from the flame and renew
our desires and renew our

00:04:34.718 --> 00:04:37.990
quests.
It is to be learned--

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.990
This cleaving and this burning,
But only by the one who

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:45.009
Spends out himself again.
In order to do this,

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:50.339
you've got to spend yourself
repeatedly, over and over again.

00:04:50.339 --> 00:04:58.135
And then he gives us other
images of this kind of repeated

00:04:58.135 --> 00:05:00.420
burning:
Twice and twice

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:04.290
(Again the smoking souvenir,
Bleeding eidolon!

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:11.870
["eidolon" is a Greek word for
"image"]) and yet again.

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:16.139
This activity is repeated and
repeated:

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:18.870
Until the bright logic is
won

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:24.039
Unwhispering [he returns to
that initial enigmatic image]

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:26.939
as a mirror
Is believed.

00:05:26.939 --> 00:05:32.290
Then, drop by caustic drop,
a perfect cry

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:35.839
Shall string some constant
harmony,--

00:05:35.839 --> 00:05:40.928
Relentless caper for all those
[and here we are challenged and

00:05:40.928 --> 00:05:44.540
invited to
meet him and join him] who step

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:49.440
The legend of their youth into
the noon.

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:53.299
Well, it's a hard poem and yet
there are a few,

00:05:53.299 --> 00:05:56.991
I think, simple,
basic ideas that it projects

00:05:56.991 --> 00:06:02.110
that are important to the poet
that Crane saw himself as,

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:10.860
and the one he wants us to
receive and in a sense join.

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:16.663
He presents himself as an
unrepentant visionary,

00:06:16.663 --> 00:06:24.071
Romantic, and lover – since,
after all, these roles are all

00:06:24.071 --> 00:06:28.269
held in some association here.
 

00:06:28.269 --> 00:06:33.395
He talks about here a
willingness that's erotic,

00:06:33.395 --> 00:06:37.430
that's aesthetic,
that's spiritual;

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:42.490
to exhaust oneself in the
pursuit of one's desires;

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:48.410
to "spend out" yourself again
and repeatedly.

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:54.566
There is in this the promise
that by doing it repeatedly,

00:06:54.566 --> 00:07:01.271
"drop by caustic drop," a kind
of lyric voice will emerge that

00:07:01.271 --> 00:07:04.350
will be "a perfect cry."
 

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:13.196
And despite this destruction
and pain and blood,

00:07:13.196 --> 00:07:22.043
"bleeding eidolon",
a "constant harmony "will be

00:07:22.043 --> 00:07:26.635
achieved,
"harmony" invoking,

00:07:26.635 --> 00:07:30.250
of course, more than one voice.
 

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:31.910
And what is this?
 

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:37.711
This is a poetic project,
and it's a project that he

00:07:37.711 --> 00:07:44.310
describes as a "relentless
caper," a "relentless caper."

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:51.634
"Caper" comes from Latin,
in the sense of the goat that

00:07:51.634 --> 00:07:56.924
leaps.
It's also a word that suggests,

00:07:56.924 --> 00:08:04.112
well, some kind of minor
mischief: a "relentless caper

00:08:04.112 --> 00:08:11.978
for all those who step / the
legend of their youth into the

00:08:11.978 --> 00:08:15.541
noon."
And here, Crane presents

00:08:15.541 --> 00:08:20.115
himself as a young person who
would project all of the

00:08:20.115 --> 00:08:24.517
youthful vitality of his vision
and desire into this

00:08:24.517 --> 00:08:29.610
symbolically pregnant moment
that he calls "the noon."

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:34.880
It's a time very important in
Crane's imagination,

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:39.472
I think: idiosyncratically,
individually,

00:08:39.472 --> 00:08:46.040
but also in a way that alludes
to noon in Emily Dickinson's

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:49.384
poems;
Dickinson being a poet that

00:08:49.384 --> 00:08:52.139
Crane shares a great deal with.
 

00:08:52.139 --> 00:09:01.082
The poetry of Hart Crane--it
proposes to approach what he

00:09:01.082 --> 00:09:09.226
calls "noon," which is an
experience of fullness and

00:09:09.226 --> 00:09:12.740
absolute presence.
 

00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:19.137
Now, what does he mean,
he's "not ready for

00:09:19.137 --> 00:09:23.268
repentance"?
Who after all has told him to

00:09:23.268 --> 00:09:23.820
repent?
 

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:26.960
 
 

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:32.730
Who has told him he has
something to regret?

00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:38.718
"Repent" is something that
Crane heard from the culture at

00:09:38.718 --> 00:09:41.450
large in important ways.
 

00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:45.305
Crane is writing in the
mid-twenties,

00:09:45.305 --> 00:09:47.340
or at this point.
 

00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:51.110
I think this is a poem from
1924 or so.

00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:56.580
It is post-war America.
 

00:09:56.580 --> 00:10:04.189
Crane sees himself as a member
of a new youthful world,

00:10:04.189 --> 00:10:10.389
centered in places like
Greenwich Village.

00:10:10.389 --> 00:10:16.418
He sees himself as part of a
young America,

00:10:16.418 --> 00:10:25.031
bound together across place by
a kind of common dedication to

00:10:25.031 --> 00:10:33.500
art and to their will to free
themselves from the sexual and

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:42.112
economic disciplines that he
calls in this letter that I have

00:10:42.112 --> 00:10:50.019
quoted other sentences from,
calls "Puritanism."

00:10:50.019 --> 00:11:00.875
Crane is writing in an era,
the era of the Eighteenth

00:11:00.875 --> 00:11:08.179
Amendment.
Prohibition is in effect.

00:11:08.179 --> 00:11:17.034
There is a range of kinds of
censorship that are a real and

00:11:17.034 --> 00:11:21.610
present threat.
James Joyce's novel

00:11:21.610 --> 00:11:27.760
Ulysses has been banned
from the United States shores

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:29.950
for its obscenity.
 

00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:35.014
There's a way in which
modernist art is mixed up with

00:11:35.014 --> 00:11:37.450
questions of sexuality.
 

00:11:37.450 --> 00:11:42.672
Crane got his copy of
Ulysses smuggled from

00:11:42.672 --> 00:11:46.509
France, which a friend then
stole.

00:11:46.509 --> 00:11:55.070
Crane is living,
too, in a vital and nascent gay

00:11:55.070 --> 00:12:01.809
culture, in New York in
particular,

00:12:01.809 --> 00:12:08.538
and yet within a nation,
then as now,

00:12:08.538 --> 00:12:20.500
that is strongly homophobic and
anti-gay in all sorts of ways.

00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:26.870
Crane's insistence on,
his refusal to repent,

00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:33.820
his refusal to regret,
are assertions of his will

00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:41.350
towards forms of sexual and
imaginative freedom.

00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:47.958
They're also affirmations of a
Romantic poetics,

00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:50.630
essential to him.
 

00:12:50.630 --> 00:12:55.759
 
 

00:12:55.759 --> 00:13:02.767
There's also a literary
historical context for this

00:13:02.767 --> 00:13:10.756
that's important and that I
think you can probably already

00:13:10.756 --> 00:13:13.840
start to guess at.
 

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:20.730
Crane is a deep and a deeply
ambivalent reader of The

00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:23.612
Waste Land and T.S.
 

00:13:23.612 --> 00:13:27.257
Eliot.
He says in this letter to

00:13:27.257 --> 00:13:32.557
Gorham Munson in January 1923:
There's no one writing in

00:13:32.557 --> 00:13:35.975
English who can command so much
respect, to my mind,

00:13:35.975 --> 00:13:38.782
as Eliot.
However, I take Eliot as a

00:13:38.782 --> 00:13:43.018
point of departure towards an
almost complete reverse of

00:13:43.018 --> 00:13:46.287
direction.
His pessimism is amply

00:13:46.287 --> 00:13:49.070
justified in his own case.
 

00:13:49.070 --> 00:13:50.250
[Why? I don't know.
 

00:13:50.250 --> 00:13:55.428
Well, Crane had his fantasies
about Eliot's sexual life,

00:13:55.428 --> 00:13:58.911
I think.]
But I would apply as much of

00:13:58.911 --> 00:14:04.937
his erudition and technique as I
can absorb and assemble toward a

00:14:04.937 --> 00:14:09.553
more positive,
or if I must put it so in a

00:14:09.553 --> 00:14:12.590
skeptical age,
ecstatic goal.

00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:17.277
I should not think of this if a
kind of rhythm and ecstasy were

00:14:17.277 --> 00:14:21.360
not at odd moments and rare a
very real thing to me.

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:24.794
I feel that Eliot ignores
certain spiritual events and

00:14:24.794 --> 00:14:27.515
possibilities,
as real and powerful now as,

00:14:27.515 --> 00:14:29.460
say, in the time of Blake.
 

00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:31.971
[Blake is very important to
Crane.]

00:14:31.971 --> 00:14:36.330
Certainly the man has dug the
ground and buried hope as deep

00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:39.360
and direfully as it can ever be
done.

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:45.396
After this perfection of death
[which is what Crane is--this is

00:14:45.396 --> 00:14:49.096
how he's reading The Waste
Land]

00:14:49.096 --> 00:14:54.938
nothing is possible in motion
but a resurrection of some kind

00:14:54.938 --> 00:14:57.080
[he says].
 

00:14:57.080 --> 00:15:02.629
 
 

00:15:02.629 --> 00:15:10.992
Crane is reading The Waste
Land and he's reading

00:15:10.992 --> 00:15:14.090
Eliot's criticism.
 

00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:20.228
He's responding to--well,
he's responding to a series of

00:15:20.228 --> 00:15:27.259
texts, and I'll just show you
some of what he's reading here.

00:15:27.259 --> 00:15:36.879
This is The Criterion,
the first place Eliot's poetry,

00:15:36.879 --> 00:15:42.330
The Waste Land,
appeared.

00:15:42.330 --> 00:15:46.340
That's in October 1922,
Eliot's own magazine.

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:55.477
The first American publication
of the poem was in The

00:15:55.477 --> 00:16:04.988
Dial in November 1922,
and then the poem appeared in

00:16:04.988 --> 00:16:14.706
– I don't know if you can see
that very well – the poem

00:16:14.706 --> 00:16:23.586
appeared in a New York
publication in book form as its

00:16:23.586 --> 00:16:27.440
own discreet text.
 

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:33.832
When the Liveright edition of
the poem was being prepared,

00:16:33.832 --> 00:16:38.692
as I mentioned last time,
Eliot was asked to make the

00:16:38.692 --> 00:16:41.882
poem a little longer,
because after all it was a

00:16:41.882 --> 00:16:46.205
little too short,
and, or so the story goes,

00:16:46.205 --> 00:16:52.819
this was in part one of his
motives for producing the notes

00:16:52.819 --> 00:16:56.890
to the poem.
As I said last time,

00:16:56.890 --> 00:17:03.383
this is the way the poem looked
in America when it first

00:17:03.383 --> 00:17:10.230
appeared, and of course with
just a few lines per page.

00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:14.549
Last time I called it the
shortest long poem in the

00:17:14.549 --> 00:17:18.606
language.
You can see the way in which

00:17:18.606 --> 00:17:21.269
it's sort of drawn out.
 

00:17:21.269 --> 00:17:27.009
Here's the little section I
ended by talking about,

00:17:27.009 --> 00:17:29.190
"Death by Water."
 

00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:38.439
Well, as I suggested last time,
Eliot's notes suggested and

00:17:38.439 --> 00:17:48.327
created a kind of role for the
poet where the poet was not only

00:17:48.327 --> 00:17:57.895
the creative lyric presence at
the center of the poem but was

00:17:57.895 --> 00:18:05.709
also a kind of scholar and
critic of his own work:

00:18:05.709 --> 00:18:12.060
framing it,
mastering bodies of knowledge,

00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:18.480
and arranging meaning in ways
that the notes emblematize.

00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:23.482
In the process,
Eliot's doing a couple of

00:18:23.482 --> 00:18:28.109
things that Crane is responding
to.

00:18:28.109 --> 00:18:36.262
He is establishing himself in
what I described as a new role,

00:18:36.262 --> 00:18:44.549
and that's very much the role
you see Eliot embodying here;

00:18:44.549 --> 00:18:52.236
that is, the poet as a kind of
scholar poet,

00:18:52.236 --> 00:19:00.102
a figure backed by
institutional authority of

00:19:00.102 --> 00:19:06.770
various kinds.
And this figure's created

00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:14.361
specifically in The Waste
Land through the poem's

00:19:14.361 --> 00:19:20.019
turning away from and turning
against,

00:19:20.019 --> 00:19:25.641
in complicated ways,
its own forms of Romanticism,

00:19:25.641 --> 00:19:31.608
which last time I suggested
were emblematized by that

00:19:31.608 --> 00:19:38.575
drowned Phoenician sailor,
Phlebas, who is a kind of

00:19:38.575 --> 00:19:43.932
figure for what the poem
sacrifices or,

00:19:43.932 --> 00:19:48.999
you might say,
a kind of version of the self

00:19:48.999 --> 00:19:52.130
that Eliot is willing to give
up.

00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:56.855
Crane, encountering the poem,
I think, must have been

00:19:56.855 --> 00:20:04.204
obsessed with the section,
"Death by Water"--must have

00:20:04.204 --> 00:20:14.880
seen, must have heard Eliot
talking to him when Eliot says,

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:24.289
"Consider Phlebas who was once
handsome and tall as you."

00:20:24.289 --> 00:20:30.908
Crane means to reassert the
power of youth,

00:20:30.908 --> 00:20:38.000
reassert the potential for
Romantic vision,

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:43.861
and to do so in a way that he
imagines as a kind of

00:20:43.861 --> 00:20:47.730
resurrection and,
specifically,

00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:54.160
as a kind of passage through
and beyond "Death by Water."

00:20:54.160 --> 00:21:04.022
Drowning is an important
imaginative motif in Crane's

00:21:04.022 --> 00:21:10.068
work.
The poems that I'll concentrate

00:21:10.068 --> 00:21:19.658
on now to explore this idea all
have images of romance quest and

00:21:19.658 --> 00:21:23.920
drowning at their center.
 

00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:31.025
And I mean, first of all,
the very great love poem called

00:21:31.025 --> 00:21:38.214
"Voyages" on page 609,
which Eliot or--excuse me,

00:21:38.214 --> 00:21:48.257
which Crane began in the spring
of 1924, about a year after he's

00:21:48.257 --> 00:21:53.039
read The Waste Land.
 

00:21:53.039 --> 00:21:57.987
And the poem is,
I think, his first sort of

00:21:57.987 --> 00:22:01.639
developed reply,
and it centers,

00:22:01.639 --> 00:22:05.880
as I say, on images of
drowning.

00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:13.713
The poem arises from a love
affair with, as it happens,

00:22:13.713 --> 00:22:22.417
a Danish sailor who was part of
the Bohemian crowd around the

00:22:22.417 --> 00:22:29.089
Provincetown Players in
Greenwich Village.

00:22:29.089 --> 00:22:37.915
Crane's letters are full of
both reflections on Eliot and

00:22:37.915 --> 00:22:47.528
also ecstatic and very moving
accounts of his love affair with

00:22:47.528 --> 00:22:52.456
Emil Opffer.
I'll read you just a few

00:22:52.456 --> 00:22:57.870
sentences from one letter to his
friend, Waldo Frank.

00:22:57.870 --> 00:23:01.182
He says--Crane does:
It will take many letters

00:23:01.182 --> 00:23:03.670
to let you know what I mean,
for myself at least,

00:23:03.670 --> 00:23:08.983
when I say in this relationship
that I have seen the Word made

00:23:08.983 --> 00:23:13.150
flesh.
I mean nothing less.

00:23:13.150 --> 00:23:16.219
And I know now that there is
such a thing as

00:23:16.219 --> 00:23:19.360
indestructibility,
in the deepest sense where

00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:23.358
flesh became transformed through
intensity of response to

00:23:23.358 --> 00:23:27.415
counter-response,
where sex was beaten out,

00:23:27.415 --> 00:23:31.860
where a purity of joy was
reached that included

00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:36.045
tears.
Now, imagery from this and

00:23:36.045 --> 00:23:42.042
other letters that Crane wrote
during the period emerge in

00:23:42.042 --> 00:23:45.357
"Voyages."
The very first section of

00:23:45.357 --> 00:23:48.942
"Voyages" had been,
in fact, sitting on Crane's

00:23:48.942 --> 00:23:53.351
desk for three years:
Above the fresh ruffles

00:23:53.351 --> 00:23:57.483
of the surf
Bright striped urchins flay

00:23:57.483 --> 00:24:00.019
each other with sand.
 

00:24:00.019 --> 00:24:06.619
They have contrived a conquest
for shell shucks,

00:24:06.619 --> 00:24:10.680
And their fingers crumble
fragments of baked weed

00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:13.029
Gaily digging and scattering.
 

00:24:13.029 --> 00:24:16.400
And in answer to their treble
interjections

00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:19.299
The sun beats lightning on the
waves,

00:24:19.299 --> 00:24:22.150
The waves fold thunder in the
sand;

00:24:22.150 --> 00:24:26.900
And could they hear me I would
tell them:

00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:30.950
O brilliant kids,
frisk with your dog,

00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:36.100
Fondle your shells and sticks,
bleached

00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:41.140
By time and the elements;
but there is a line

00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:45.150
You must not cross nor ever
trust beyond it

00:24:45.150 --> 00:24:49.380
Spry cordage of your bodies to
caresses

00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:52.930
Too lichen-faithful from too
wide a breast.

00:24:52.930 --> 00:24:57.380
The bottom of the sea is
cruel.

00:24:57.380 --> 00:25:05.049
The poem begins on shore,
begins with kids playing.

00:25:05.049 --> 00:25:13.486
Their play in all its innocence
seems to imply and gesture

00:25:13.486 --> 00:25:22.513
towards ferocious energies that
are emblematized by the sea in

00:25:22.513 --> 00:25:29.470
all of its thunder and lightning
and power.

00:25:29.470 --> 00:25:32.910
They fondle, they flay.
 

00:25:32.910 --> 00:25:41.985
The shoreline is a place where
there are fragments of debris,

00:25:41.985 --> 00:25:46.069
proof of the sea's force.
 

00:25:46.069 --> 00:25:54.722
The poem begins with a simple
moral injunction or,

00:25:54.722 --> 00:26:00.019
really, a practical warning.
 

00:26:00.019 --> 00:26:06.554
To give yourself over to the
sea would be to enter a field of

00:26:06.554 --> 00:26:10.802
unbounded energy,
to risk your identity,

00:26:10.802 --> 00:26:14.069
to risk being overwhelmed.
 

00:26:14.069 --> 00:26:17.396
Think of Prufrock,
on the shore,

00:26:17.396 --> 00:26:21.259
"shall I wear my trousers
rolled?"

00:26:21.259 --> 00:26:25.174
Crane is there,
in the same place,

00:26:25.174 --> 00:26:32.529
and having issued this warning,
having acknowledged the cruelty

00:26:32.529 --> 00:26:38.492
of the bottom of the sea,
he throws it off and throws it

00:26:38.492 --> 00:26:43.914
behind, and enters the water:
-- And yet [that

00:26:43.914 --> 00:26:51.079
important piece of Cranian
punctuation, the dash--a bit

00:26:51.079 --> 00:26:56.309
of punctuation that separates
and connects elements--pushes

00:26:56.309 --> 00:26:59.942
that
warning away and takes us into

00:26:59.942 --> 00:27:03.859
the sea]
this great wink of eternity,

00:27:03.859 --> 00:27:08.887
Of rimless floods,
become borderless space,

00:27:08.887 --> 00:27:14.871
unfettered leewardings,
Samite sheeted and processioned

00:27:14.871 --> 00:27:18.279
where
Her undinal vast belly…

00:27:18.279 --> 00:27:23.273
Crane images the sea here as a
woman's body and as a kind of

00:27:23.273 --> 00:27:26.319
belly that bends towards the
moon.

00:27:26.319 --> 00:27:31.435
It's a kind of vision of the
open horizon of the sea as,

00:27:31.435 --> 00:27:37.109
you know, it seems to project
the curve of the earth in it.

00:27:37.109 --> 00:27:41.009
Her undinal vast belly
moonward bends,

00:27:41.009 --> 00:27:46.519
Laughing the wrapt inflections
of our love;

00:27:46.519 --> 00:27:54.490
That's a wonderful Cranian
word, "wrapt."

00:27:54.490 --> 00:27:59.014
It would seem to mean both
"wrapped," in the sense of

00:27:59.014 --> 00:28:04.410
"wrapped up," and "rapt," in the
sense of "held in rapture."

00:28:04.410 --> 00:28:07.945
He's kind of combined,
possibly through error,

00:28:07.945 --> 00:28:10.810
these two forms.
Crane makes errors.

00:28:10.810 --> 00:28:15.369
He's unlike the scholarly Eliot.
 

00:28:15.369 --> 00:28:20.400
He continues,
and now gives us instructions:

00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:23.720
Take this Sea,
whose diapason knells

00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:26.299
On scrolls of silver snowy
sentences,

00:28:26.299 --> 00:28:29.460
The sceptred terror of whose
session rends

00:28:29.460 --> 00:28:33.849
As her demeanors motion well or
ill,

00:28:33.849 --> 00:28:38.160
All but the pieties of lovers'
hands.

00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:45.539
Here, being in the space of the
sea is like being in love or in

00:28:45.539 --> 00:28:50.299
the act of love,
as Crane imagines it.

00:28:50.299 --> 00:28:55.437
It's also like being in a
fabulous rhetorical world:

00:28:55.437 --> 00:28:59.769
a space of gorgeous extravagant
language,

00:28:59.769 --> 00:29:08.740
which Crane unleashes here in
all of its terrific force.

00:29:08.740 --> 00:29:15.076
Its language,
which is iambic pentameter,

00:29:15.076 --> 00:29:21.095
unlike Eliot,
is a language as rich and

00:29:21.095 --> 00:29:28.540
ornate as on the English
Renaissance stage.

00:29:28.540 --> 00:29:30.509
Marlowe would have liked this.
 

00:29:30.509 --> 00:29:36.825
It is also a kind of Romantic
diction, and there are elements

00:29:36.825 --> 00:29:41.772
of a sort of late
nineteenth-century British and

00:29:41.772 --> 00:29:46.720
French poetry that Crane is
combining here.

00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:48.483
He says:
And onward,

00:29:48.483 --> 00:29:52.665
as bells off San Salvador
Salute the crocus lustres of

00:29:52.665 --> 00:29:55.860
the stars,
In these poinsettia meadows of

00:29:55.860 --> 00:29:58.665
her tides,--
Adagios of islands,

00:29:58.665 --> 00:30:03.666
O my Prodigal,
Complete the dark confessions

00:30:03.666 --> 00:30:09.646
her veins spell.
Mark how her turning shoulders

00:30:09.646 --> 00:30:15.008
wind the hours,
And hasten while her penniless

00:30:15.008 --> 00:30:18.020
rich palms
Pass superscription of bent

00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:20.945
foam and wave,--
Hasten, while they are true

00:30:20.945 --> 00:30:23.790
[because they will not be true
forever],--

00:30:23.790 --> 00:30:29.104
sleep, death desire,
Close round one instant in one

00:30:29.104 --> 00:30:35.542
floating flower.
Crane understands that love,

00:30:35.542 --> 00:30:39.845
like rhetoric,
casts a spell,

00:30:39.845 --> 00:30:46.759
and that love and poetry create
illusions.

00:30:46.759 --> 00:30:50.380
He does not therefore despise
them;

00:30:50.380 --> 00:30:58.349
different from Eliot,
in a basic way.

00:30:58.349 --> 00:31:05.911
He acknowledges,
as it were, the temporariness

00:31:05.911 --> 00:31:09.789
of his desire.
In fact he says:

00:31:09.789 --> 00:31:15.450
Bind us in time,
O Seasons clear,

00:31:15.450 --> 00:31:19.131
and awe.
O minstrel galleons of Carib

00:31:19.131 --> 00:31:21.318
fire,
What are "minstrel galleons of

00:31:21.318 --> 00:31:23.478
Carib fire"?
Well, maybe they're actual

00:31:23.478 --> 00:31:26.029
ships that he's imagining
passing among.

00:31:26.029 --> 00:31:36.110
Maybe they are the lights of
the moon or sun on the sea.

00:31:36.110 --> 00:31:42.177
He says to the sea:
Bequeath us [I know we're

00:31:42.177 --> 00:31:47.980
going to die]
to no earthly shore [in other

00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:57.301
words, "don't bury us"]
until [and as in legend,

00:31:57.301 --> 00:32:07.619
Crane produces a funny,
syntactic reversal here]

00:32:07.619 --> 00:32:13.279
Is answered in the vortex of
our grave

00:32:13.279 --> 00:32:18.240
The seal's wide spindrift gaze
toward paradise.

00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:23.950
There the subject of the
sentence comes last.

00:32:23.950 --> 00:32:28.576
The sentence is:
"The seal's wide spindrift gaze

00:32:28.576 --> 00:32:32.710
is answered in the vortex of our
grave."

00:32:32.710 --> 00:32:38.656
What Crane has done there is:
he's reversed the syntactic

00:32:38.656 --> 00:32:41.630
order of subject and verb.
 

00:32:41.630 --> 00:32:45.272
By doing so,
he's introduced first the image

00:32:45.272 --> 00:32:50.354
of death by drowning – that
is, the vortex of our grave –

00:32:50.354 --> 00:32:56.037
and he's put that up first;
and then, he's followed it with

00:32:56.037 --> 00:33:01.756
the image of the seal's gaze,
which comes and emerges after

00:33:01.756 --> 00:33:06.629
drowning.
The seal is here a figure of a

00:33:06.629 --> 00:33:14.376
kind of consciousness and desire
expressed through the eyes that

00:33:14.376 --> 00:33:19.237
survives death.
Look back to the poem

00:33:19.237 --> 00:33:24.279
preceding, called "At Melville's
Tomb."

00:33:24.279 --> 00:33:31.331
Here this is an elegy for
Melville which seems to presume,

00:33:31.331 --> 00:33:38.135
falsely, that Melville was
drowned, and is not buried on

00:33:38.135 --> 00:33:44.109
shore, as he is.
And there's an image again of

00:33:44.109 --> 00:33:51.589
drowning in lines 11 and 12,
and again an image of a vortex:

00:33:51.589 --> 00:33:54.768
Then in the circuit calm
of one vast coil [after the

00:33:54.768 --> 00:33:56.720
storm that has wrecked the
ship],

00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:59.887
Its lashings charmed [and those
lashings remind you of the

00:33:59.887 --> 00:34:03.396
flayings of
the kids in "Voyages"]

00:34:03.396 --> 00:34:09.318
and malice reconciled,
Frosted eyes there were that

00:34:09.318 --> 00:34:13.810
lifted altars;
And silent answers crept across

00:34:13.810 --> 00:34:18.789
the stars.
How do eyes lift altars?

00:34:18.789 --> 00:34:24.569
In Crane's letter to Harriet
Munroe, in defense of this poem

00:34:24.569 --> 00:34:28.880
and what he calls "the logic of
metaphor,"

00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:33.034
Crane says, well,
eyes lift altars in the sense

00:34:33.034 --> 00:34:38.454
that they bring the object of
their desire into being through

00:34:38.454 --> 00:34:43.520
their desire;
that is, you raise the altar,

00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:49.972
you create the object of
worship through your yearning

00:34:49.972 --> 00:34:52.651
for it.
This is, again,

00:34:52.651 --> 00:34:57.815
a kind of visionary act,
and it's a version of the one

00:34:57.815 --> 00:35:03.370
that we find at the end of the
second section of "Voyages"

00:35:03.370 --> 00:35:07.559
where we see the
seagull's--excuse me,

00:35:07.559 --> 00:35:14.530
"the seal's wide spindrift gaze
toward paradise."

00:35:14.530 --> 00:35:20.816
"Wide."
"Wide" because it's a gaze that

00:35:20.816 --> 00:35:26.000
is large and takes in much
space;

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:31.203
"wide" because the sea is a
kind of space in which we have

00:35:31.203 --> 00:35:33.119
latitude of action.
 

00:35:33.119 --> 00:35:37.144
"Spindrift":
it's a word that Crane took

00:35:37.144 --> 00:35:41.170
from Moby Dick,
from Melville,

00:35:41.170 --> 00:35:44.943
replacing another word – not
such a good word – which also

00:35:44.943 --> 00:35:47.480
came from Moby Dick:
"finrinny."

00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:49.560
It's good he got rid of that.
 

00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:52.570
"Spindrift" is important.
 

00:35:52.570 --> 00:35:55.040
When you are in the sea,
it is like being in a Crane

00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:56.811
poem.
You don't have the ground under

00:35:56.811 --> 00:35:59.239
your feet.
You spin and you drift;

00:35:59.239 --> 00:36:03.643
you spin and you drift and
words mix and match and create

00:36:03.643 --> 00:36:05.610
words like "spindrift."
 

00:36:05.610 --> 00:36:09.570
This is a condition that Crane
calls, in the next poem,

00:36:09.570 --> 00:36:15.387
"infinite consanguinity,"
where there's a kind of sharing

00:36:15.387 --> 00:36:21.949
of elements, a kind of
transformation through exchange

00:36:21.949 --> 00:36:25.901
that goes on.
This is understood as what

00:36:25.901 --> 00:36:29.798
happens in love.
It's also understood as a kind

00:36:29.798 --> 00:36:32.320
of model for poetic process.
 

00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:39.084
It's imaged here in this poem
in triumphant language as a kind

00:36:39.084 --> 00:36:42.190
of transcendence of death.
 

00:36:42.190 --> 00:36:48.775
Here, describing a moment of
climactic intensity,

00:36:48.775 --> 00:36:51.757
Crane writes:
And so,

00:36:51.757 --> 00:36:54.000
admitted through black swollen
gates

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:56.730
That must arrest all distance
otherwise,--

00:36:56.730 --> 00:37:00.230
Past whirling pillars and lithe
pediments,

00:37:00.230 --> 00:37:03.190
Light wresting there
incessantly with light,

00:37:03.190 --> 00:37:07.940
Star kissing star through wave
on wave unto

00:37:07.940 --> 00:37:12.429
Your body rocking!
 

00:37:12.429 --> 00:37:17.840
and where death,
if shed [like a skin],

00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:21.932
Presumes no carnage [no final
death of the body],

00:37:21.932 --> 00:37:24.150
but [rather]
this single

00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:27.412
change,--
Upon the steep floor flung from

00:37:27.412 --> 00:37:30.814
dawn to dawn
The silken skilled

00:37:30.814 --> 00:37:35.627
transmemberment of song;
Permit me voyage,

00:37:35.627 --> 00:37:40.714
love, into your hands…
"The silken skilled

00:37:40.714 --> 00:37:46.586
transmemberment of song":
this is Crane's final,

00:37:46.586 --> 00:37:51.460
fantastic line of iambic
pentameter,

00:37:51.460 --> 00:37:58.151
where he proclaims a kind of
transformation that is at once

00:37:58.151 --> 00:38:03.927
erotic and rhetorical,
where elements between two

00:38:03.927 --> 00:38:11.098
parties have been exchanged and
reversed just as the "silk" and

00:38:11.098 --> 00:38:17.691
"skill" give us phonemes that
are held in almost a kind of

00:38:17.691 --> 00:38:21.854
mirror relationship and
alliteration:

00:38:21.854 --> 00:38:26.250
the i-l-k,
k-i-l.

00:38:26.250 --> 00:38:31.804
And then Crane introduces us to
another word that he coins:

00:38:31.804 --> 00:38:33.719
"transmemberment."
 

00:38:33.719 --> 00:38:35.623
"Transmemberment":
what does "transmemberment"

00:38:35.623 --> 00:38:36.589
mean?
It seems to be made out

00:38:36.589 --> 00:38:38.426
of--what?
Remember,

00:38:38.426 --> 00:38:42.389
dismember,
transformation.

00:38:42.389 --> 00:38:46.402
He's talking about a kind of
activity that involves all these

00:38:46.402 --> 00:38:51.076
things at once,
and through it achieves a kind

00:38:51.076 --> 00:38:55.085
of vision of union,
which is again,

00:38:55.085 --> 00:39:00.355
as I say,
both linguistic and

00:39:00.355 --> 00:39:06.156
interpersonal.
Well, that seems like a good

00:39:06.156 --> 00:39:08.420
place to stop for now.
 

00:39:08.420 --> 00:39:14.930
We'll carry these poems on as a
way to read his long poem in

00:39:14.930 --> 00:39:21.000
reply to The Waste Land
– The Bridge.

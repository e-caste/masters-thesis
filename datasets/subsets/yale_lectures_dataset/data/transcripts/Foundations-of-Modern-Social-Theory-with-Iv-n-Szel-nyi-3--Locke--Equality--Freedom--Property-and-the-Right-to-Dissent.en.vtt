00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:09.227
Prof: If so,
then let's go on to John Locke,

00:00:09.227 --> 00:00:16.681
another major scientist and
another major founder of

00:00:16.681 --> 00:00:23.550
political and social philosophy
and theory.

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.250
I'll do again what I did with
Hobbes.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.751
We will again do briefly,
for those who are not

00:00:29.751 --> 00:00:32.340
interested in lives and history.
 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:38.189
So first I introduce you,
our friend today,

00:00:38.189 --> 00:00:40.000
John Locke.
 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.970
He was born in 1642 in Somerset.
 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:50.320
His father was a captain in a
parliamentary army;

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:56.661
a kind of small gentry,
not particularly wealthy but

00:00:56.661 --> 00:00:58.900
not poor either.
 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:07.766
In '52, he went to Oxford,
and it was noted that he was

00:01:07.766 --> 00:01:14.500
"idle, unhappy and
unremarkable"

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.799
in Oxford.
 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:22.110
Well if you do not have a 4.0
at Yale, don't panic.

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:22.959
Right?
 

00:01:22.959 --> 00:01:26.080
You still can be John Locke.
 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.810
There are somebody who blossom
later;

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.060
he was a late blossomer.
 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:43.486
But by the end he was doing
well, and in fact he became an

00:01:43.486 --> 00:01:49.057
official;
you know, English universities

00:01:49.057 --> 00:01:52.260
called teachers officials.
 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.775
Officers--even at Yale,
you know, we are called

00:01:56.775 --> 00:02:00.409
officers of Yale
Corporation--kind of,

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:04.140
I think, an old English
tradition.

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.733
Anyway, he was admitted,
and then in '64 he gave an

00:02:08.733 --> 00:02:11.030
address to the college.
 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.872
And this is a very important
address because this is when we

00:02:15.872 --> 00:02:19.318
can learn the views of young
John Locke.

00:02:19.318 --> 00:02:22.620
And quite clear from this
address that,

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:28.354
in fact, early in his life he
was very traditionalist and

00:02:28.354 --> 00:02:33.066
quite authoritarian:
The kings are good and the

00:02:33.066 --> 00:02:35.319
people are beasts.
 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:37.818
So in a way he was Hobbesian.
 

00:02:37.818 --> 00:02:43.160
In fact, you know,
in the Two Treatises he

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.610
stays away discussing Hobbes.
 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.598
But, of course,
the ghost of Hobbes is all over

00:02:51.598 --> 00:02:52.682
the place.
 

00:02:52.682 --> 00:02:53.660
Right?
 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:03:03.786
&lt;&lt;Professor
Szelényi invites students

00:03:03.786 --> 00:03:08.538
to take seats&gt;&gt;
 

00:03:08.538 --> 00:03:15.405
Well, a little about the
times--'49, I already mentioned,

00:03:15.405 --> 00:03:18.470
Charles I was executed.
 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.758
The monarchy was abolished for
a time.

00:03:21.758 --> 00:03:30.658
Oliver Cromwell became Lord
Protector of England.

00:03:30.658 --> 00:03:35.370
But though he was very popular
among many,

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.460
he really could not control the
struggle between the military

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:44.129
and the parliament,
and the chaos--what Hobbes

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:49.129
experienced in the '30s and
early '40s--

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:51.300
in some ways continued.
 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:55.169
It was probably not as bad as
before but was still very bad.

00:03:55.169 --> 00:04:00.122
Well when Cromwell died,
his son tried to become Lord

00:04:00.122 --> 00:04:02.844
Protector--
did not succeed,

00:04:02.844 --> 00:04:08.229
and finally it was decided to
call back Charles I's son,

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:11.400
Charles II, to become King of
England.

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:16.680
So the monarchy was restored.
 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:22.500
So these will remain turbulent
years, and, of course,

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:28.879
the kind of turbulence does
color what Locke stood for.

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:34.333
Well, just a picture of Oliver
Cromwell for you,

00:04:34.333 --> 00:04:39.786
and then Charles II,
who was King of England for

00:04:39.786 --> 00:04:42.339
twenty-five years.
 

00:04:42.339 --> 00:04:46.180
Well there is a New Haven
connection to all of this.

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.480
Not all of you may know that.
 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:55.031
But I'm sure everybody knows
where Whalley Avenue is,

00:04:55.031 --> 00:04:58.019
and where Goffe Street is.
 

00:04:58.019 --> 00:05:05.040
Well this has something to do
with England and John Locke.

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:09.786
Two of the judges of the trial
of Charles I,

00:05:09.786 --> 00:05:16.519
Edward Whalley and William
Goffe, were accused of regicide.

00:05:16.519 --> 00:05:25.819
And they escaped England in
1660, and they went to Boston.

00:05:25.819 --> 00:05:29.199
Well they did the wrong choice,
right?

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:32.833
They went where Harvard is,
rather than going where Yale

00:05:32.833 --> 00:05:33.031
is.
 

00:05:33.031 --> 00:05:33.560
Okay?
 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:41.451
But Boston was an unsafe place,
too much under the control of

00:05:41.451 --> 00:05:43.029
the crown.
 

00:05:43.029 --> 00:05:46.029
So therefore they went to the
right place, right?

00:05:46.029 --> 00:05:46.829
And where can it be?
 

00:05:46.829 --> 00:05:48.779
Of course, New Haven.
 

00:05:48.779 --> 00:05:51.329
So they came to New Haven.
 

00:05:51.329 --> 00:05:54.709
And you probably know where
West Rock is.

00:05:54.709 --> 00:05:58.290
Anybody was up on West Rock?
 

00:05:58.290 --> 00:05:59.250
A few of them.
 

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:04.363
Well, in West Rock you see a
sign which says "Judges'

00:06:04.363 --> 00:06:05.528
Cove."
 

00:06:05.528 --> 00:06:09.267
So if you go there,
there is a little cove and,

00:06:09.267 --> 00:06:13.817
according to the legends,
Whalley and Goffe hided in this

00:06:13.817 --> 00:06:14.550
cove.
 

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:18.959
So here you go,
history comes back home.

00:06:18.959 --> 00:06:22.781
Then they moved actually to
Milford and lived in a house

00:06:22.781 --> 00:06:25.839
there, and I have a picture of
this house.

00:06:25.839 --> 00:06:30.653
I don't swear my life on it
that this is really the house in

00:06:30.653 --> 00:06:34.488
which they hided,
but that's what some historian

00:06:34.488 --> 00:06:35.550
tells me.
 

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:41.855
Okay, then there is a turning
point in the life of John Locke

00:06:41.855 --> 00:06:46.060
in '66 when he meets a
formidable person,

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:50.370
whose name was Anthony Ashley
Cooper.

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:56.271
Well, he was a high aristocrat,
but he nevertheless was

00:06:56.271 --> 00:06:58.019
anti-Royalist.
 

00:06:58.019 --> 00:07:02.999
He joined the parliamentary
forces against Charles I,

00:07:02.999 --> 00:07:07.978
and was also a member of the
State Council during the

00:07:07.978 --> 00:07:09.990
republican times.
 

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:15.992
But he supported the
restoration of the monarchy in

00:07:15.992 --> 00:07:22.235
'66, and held very high offices
between 1660 and '73,

00:07:22.235 --> 00:07:27.759
including the position of Lord
Chancellor.

00:07:27.759 --> 00:07:34.336
Well he became the Earl of
Shaftesbury, out of the grace of

00:07:34.336 --> 00:07:40.345
the King, and usually he is
referred to as the Earl of

00:07:40.345 --> 00:07:42.160
Shaftesbury.
 

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:46.798
Well in '66,
he went to Oxford to have a

00:07:46.798 --> 00:07:53.341
cure for his liver disease,
and this is when he met John

00:07:53.341 --> 00:07:55.959
Locke as a doctor.
 

00:07:55.959 --> 00:07:59.579
And John Locke became his
physician and,

00:07:59.579 --> 00:08:02.920
let's put it this way,
his friend.

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:06.815
Probably a bit of a strong
statement because the social

00:08:06.815 --> 00:08:11.649
status difference was too big to
really call it as a friendship,

00:08:11.649 --> 00:08:16.079
but I will say a word about
their relationship.

00:08:16.079 --> 00:08:20.459
And here is the Earl of
Shaftesbury.

00:08:20.459 --> 00:08:29.146
Now in '67, Locke moved to
Ashley's house at Exeter House

00:08:29.146 --> 00:08:33.178
in the Strand in London.
 

00:08:33.178 --> 00:08:37.096
And I'm sure those of you
who've visited London know

00:08:37.096 --> 00:08:41.636
exactly where the Strand is;
that's still where sort of the

00:08:41.636 --> 00:08:44.918
legal establishment can be found
in London.

00:08:44.918 --> 00:08:47.320
So he lived there in his
household.

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:51.216
Like, you know,
in feudal times clients lived

00:08:51.216 --> 00:08:56.087
with their master's house and
ate on the master's table,

00:08:56.087 --> 00:09:01.743
or with other servants' table;
even high-ranking people

00:09:01.743 --> 00:09:07.470
occasionally were not allowed to
eat with the lord.

00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:12.038
Well he became Ashley's
confidant, advisor and surgeon.

00:09:12.038 --> 00:09:17.433
He performed a surgery,
and I think medical scientists

00:09:17.433 --> 00:09:23.542
are still puzzled whether this
was some path-breaking surgery

00:09:23.542 --> 00:09:27.409
or whether he just had good
luck--

00:09:27.409 --> 00:09:32.928
that he'd helped Ashley.
 

00:09:32.928 --> 00:09:38.836
Ashley had a surplus production
of his liver and he implanted a

00:09:38.836 --> 00:09:44.460
tube into his abdomen area to
let this surplus flow out,

00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:49.058
and certainly Ashley felt much
better after the surgery.

00:09:49.058 --> 00:09:53.676
Well we know that occasionally
the doctors say the surgery was

00:09:53.676 --> 00:09:56.250
successful and the patient died.
 

00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:59.058
Now this was a case when the
patient was cured,

00:09:59.058 --> 00:10:02.724
but we don't know whether the
surgery had anything to do with

00:10:02.724 --> 00:10:02.908
it.
 

00:10:02.908 --> 00:10:03.580
Right?
 

00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:07.519
But for those of you who are in
sciences,

00:10:07.519 --> 00:10:12.129
this is just a proof that in
the seventeenth century,

00:10:12.129 --> 00:10:16.616
you know, there was really no
distinction yet what sciences

00:10:16.616 --> 00:10:20.950
are: what philosophy is,
and what social sciences are.

00:10:20.950 --> 00:10:25.094
There was a difference what
theology was and the rest of

00:10:25.094 --> 00:10:26.298
knowledge was.
 

00:10:26.298 --> 00:10:30.080
But the rest of the knowledge
was all the same,

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:33.450
and sort of Locke was also a
scientist.

00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:36.676
In '67, he wrote an essay,
the "Essay on

00:10:36.676 --> 00:10:38.070
Toleration."
 

00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:41.360
And this is a departure now
from Hobbes.

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:47.038
This actually advocates the
right to dissent.

00:10:47.038 --> 00:10:51.009
As we have seen,
not that Hobbes at all cost

00:10:51.009 --> 00:10:54.056
would have resisted every
dissent.

00:10:54.056 --> 00:10:54.980
Right?
 

00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:58.619
You remember we discussed
that--that Hobbes also

00:10:58.619 --> 00:11:01.950
considered if the king does not
deliver,

00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:05.464
you can transfer your loyalty
from the king to another

00:11:05.464 --> 00:11:06.259
sovereign.
 

00:11:06.259 --> 00:11:09.442
But the "Essay on
Toleration"

00:11:09.442 --> 00:11:14.048
does not simply make it as such
an exceptional case,

00:11:14.048 --> 00:11:18.331
you know, but it makes a big
argument that the right of

00:11:18.331 --> 00:11:21.740
dissent is an important
individual right.

00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:26.418
He was also then elected in '68
as a member of The Royal

00:11:26.418 --> 00:11:27.269
Society.
 

00:11:27.269 --> 00:11:31.865
The Royal Society is like what
in the United States we'd call

00:11:31.865 --> 00:11:35.769
the American Academy of
Sciences--pretty hard to get

00:11:35.769 --> 00:11:40.320
into it;
was then and it is now.

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:47.649
In '79, he was already working
on the Second Treatise.

00:11:47.649 --> 00:11:51.610
Assumedly to some--I will talk
about this--there is some debate

00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:55.442
when the First Treatise
and the Second Treatise

00:11:55.442 --> 00:11:56.529
were written.
 

00:11:56.529 --> 00:12:00.778
And that's not irrelevant,
actually, the timing of the two

00:12:00.778 --> 00:12:01.450
essays.
 

00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:03.381
Well there was,
on the other hand,

00:12:03.381 --> 00:12:06.894
a conflict between Charles II
and the parliament and the Earl

00:12:06.894 --> 00:12:11.453
of Shaftesbury and,
of course, by implication John

00:12:11.453 --> 00:12:12.190
Locke.
 

00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:17.788
Charles II had only
illegitimate children;

00:12:17.788 --> 00:12:20.830
he had quite a few of them,
right?

00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:25.594
I don't know whether he liked
children, but it looks like he

00:12:25.594 --> 00:12:28.259
liked the technology,
at least.

00:12:28.259 --> 00:12:30.168
&gt;
 

00:12:30.168 --> 00:12:35.993
Well therefore,
you know, since the children

00:12:35.993 --> 00:12:41.964
were all illegitimate,
the legitimate heir to the

00:12:41.964 --> 00:12:46.629
throne was his brother,
James, and the only problem

00:12:46.629 --> 00:12:50.100
with James was that he was Roman
Catholic.

00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:54.833
And we already know from Hobbes
that this was a big trouble at

00:12:54.833 --> 00:12:56.620
that time in Britain.
 

00:12:56.620 --> 00:13:01.129
So the parliament,
and Shaftesbury himself,

00:13:01.129 --> 00:13:05.940
feared that Roman Catholics
will restore their influence,

00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:11.019
and therefore the parliament's
role will be reduced.

00:13:11.019 --> 00:13:17.113
And then in '73,
the parliament was considering

00:13:17.113 --> 00:13:20.158
a so-called Test Act.
 

00:13:20.158 --> 00:13:23.736
And this is really an ugly act,
because the Test Act meant that

00:13:23.736 --> 00:13:27.083
you have to be tested whether
you are Roman Catholic or you

00:13:27.083 --> 00:13:30.962
belong to the Church of England,
and if you are Roman Catholic

00:13:30.962 --> 00:13:33.368
then you should not hold certain
offices.

00:13:33.368 --> 00:13:33.908
Right?
 

00:13:33.908 --> 00:13:37.460
This is just straight
discrimination.

00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:40.075
But, you know,
at that time it was kind of a

00:13:40.075 --> 00:13:43.418
defense against the Vatican and
the role of the Pope.

00:13:43.418 --> 00:13:49.176
Well, because of Shaftesbury's
support for this,

00:13:49.176 --> 00:13:53.830
he was dismissed as Lord
Chancellor.

00:13:53.830 --> 00:13:57.600
Nevertheless,
a few years later the

00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:02.370
parliament does pass the
Exclusion Bill,

00:14:02.370 --> 00:14:08.798
and they are supporting James,
one of the illegitimate

00:14:08.798 --> 00:14:14.808
children of Charles,
as a successor to the throne.

00:14:14.808 --> 00:14:20.379
Well, and this is James Stuart,
the brother of Charles II,

00:14:20.379 --> 00:14:24.009
and this is the other James,
the Protestant,

00:14:24.009 --> 00:14:26.750
Shaftesbury's
protégée.

00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:30.299
Well, the Commons passed the
law.

00:14:30.299 --> 00:14:33.669
And what Charles II did?
 

00:14:33.669 --> 00:14:35.980
He dismissed the parliament.
 

00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:41.734
Well, Shaftesbury was
arrested--put into the Tower of

00:14:41.734 --> 00:14:42.730
London.
 

00:14:42.730 --> 00:14:44.986
You probably,
if you were in London,

00:14:44.986 --> 00:14:48.470
you visited the Tower,
or at least had a look at it.

00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:52.490
And after he was released,
he was smarter than to stay in

00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:55.240
England;
he went to a right place--I

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:59.230
actually like his taste--he went
to the Netherlands.

00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:01.705
If I had to be exiled,
I would prefer to be in

00:15:01.705 --> 00:15:03.190
Amsterdam, of all places.
 

00:15:03.190 --> 00:15:05.690
&gt;
 

00:15:05.690 --> 00:15:14.754
Okay, in '83 the Whigs--the
Whigs at that time were kind of

00:15:14.754 --> 00:15:18.350
the Democratic Party.
 

00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:22.164
The Tories were the Republican
Party and the Whigs were the

00:15:22.164 --> 00:15:24.600
equivalent of the Democratic
Party.

00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:29.849
Well the Whigs were accused to
have been involved in a plot to

00:15:29.849 --> 00:15:34.409
overthrow the king,
and some of them were executed.

00:15:34.409 --> 00:15:38.019
That was the Rye House Plot.
 

00:15:38.019 --> 00:15:39.440
Well Locke was smart enough.
 

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:42.868
He knew he may be next in line
so he also made the right

00:15:42.868 --> 00:15:46.639
choice;
he ran to Amsterdam. Right?

00:15:46.639 --> 00:15:51.998
Well again, I don't swear that
this was exactly the house where

00:15:51.998 --> 00:15:53.899
the plot took place.
 

00:15:53.899 --> 00:15:57.005
I'm even not sure that the plot
took place at all,

00:15:57.005 --> 00:16:00.428
or whether this was an
invention by the authorities.

00:16:00.428 --> 00:16:10.835
Well then there is a revolution
in '88, and William of Orange

00:16:10.835 --> 00:16:14.129
becomes the king.
 

00:16:14.129 --> 00:16:19.077
Well the problem was that James
II did not realize that even the

00:16:19.077 --> 00:16:22.769
Tories will not support his
religious agenda.

00:16:22.769 --> 00:16:28.349
So he was actually overthrown,
and then the Republicans and

00:16:28.349 --> 00:16:32.725
Democrats--
I'm sorry, the Tories and

00:16:32.725 --> 00:16:40.100
Whigs--came together and they
invited William to become King

00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:41.850
of England.
 

00:16:41.850 --> 00:16:44.928
And here is,
William III,

00:16:44.928 --> 00:16:50.956
and the co-ruler,
Queen Mary, his wife--was very

00:16:50.956 --> 00:16:56.600
much involved in politics and
important.

00:16:56.600 --> 00:17:05.923
And Locke then now can return
to England, and he felt safe in

00:17:05.923 --> 00:17:08.410
1690 to do so.
 

00:17:08.410 --> 00:17:12.348
Well I will talk about this
later;

00:17:12.348 --> 00:17:18.105
the Second Treatise may
actually be a reflection of the

00:17:18.105 --> 00:17:22.809
change to the House of Orange,
which is a change from

00:17:22.809 --> 00:17:25.630
absolutism to constitutional
monarchy.

00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:29.846
And therefore the Second
Treatise can be read as an

00:17:29.846 --> 00:17:34.578
ideology for a constitutional
monarchy rather than absolutism.

00:17:34.578 --> 00:17:37.319
Whether this is the case,
it is being debated.

00:17:37.319 --> 00:17:40.240
Locke died in 1704.
 

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:46.481
Interestingly,
you know, his major book,

00:17:46.481 --> 00:17:52.565
the Two Treatises on
Government,

00:17:52.565 --> 00:17:59.288
was published in 1690,
but it was published

00:17:59.288 --> 00:18:02.170
anonymously.
 

00:18:02.170 --> 00:18:06.233
He was concerned enough,
even at that time,

00:18:06.233 --> 00:18:11.750
that he may run into trouble if
he publishes this book.

00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:17.082
Okay, now I will be talking
about the Two Treatises

00:18:17.082 --> 00:18:18.858
and the work now.
 

00:18:18.858 --> 00:18:40.838
&lt;&lt;Technical
adjustments&gt;&gt;

00:18:40.838 --> 00:18:45.307
So this is the Two Treatises
of Government,

00:18:45.307 --> 00:18:49.412
which actually was--appeared in
print in 1690,

00:18:49.412 --> 00:18:53.058
as you can see on the First
Edition.

00:18:53.058 --> 00:18:55.413
Now, as I said,
there is a debate about it,

00:18:55.413 --> 00:18:58.497
when the First and the
Second Treatise was

00:18:58.497 --> 00:18:59.170
written.
 

00:18:59.170 --> 00:19:03.680
And there are two major Locke
scholars;

00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:07.890
both spent all of their life
studying Locke.

00:19:07.890 --> 00:19:13.050
Peter Laslett suggested that
the Second Treatise was

00:19:13.050 --> 00:19:15.900
written really first,
in 1679;

00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:20.421
it was all engaged in the
debates about the Exclusion

00:19:20.421 --> 00:19:21.028
Bill.
 

00:19:21.028 --> 00:19:28.272
While Richard Ashcraft--he was
my colleague at UCLA at one

00:19:28.272 --> 00:19:31.150
point;
died unfortunately very young;

00:19:31.150 --> 00:19:36.365
a brilliant scholar--actually
he argued that the Second

00:19:36.365 --> 00:19:39.568
Treatise was written in
1683.

00:19:39.568 --> 00:19:43.853
And it is a revolutionary
work--that this is really the

00:19:43.853 --> 00:19:47.977
theory of constitutional
monarchy and kind of popular

00:19:47.977 --> 00:19:52.338
sovereignty is being formulated
for the first time.

00:19:52.338 --> 00:19:57.170
This is really in strong
clash--almost absolute

00:19:57.170 --> 00:19:59.480
negation--of Hobbes.
 

00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:03.419
Well not quite absolutely;
we'll discuss some overlaps

00:20:03.419 --> 00:20:05.500
between the two arguments.
 

00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:11.509
But they both agree that that
the first treatise was written

00:20:11.509 --> 00:20:18.130
in 1680, that's uncontroversial,
and was published anonymously.

00:20:18.130 --> 00:20:23.440
So the First Treatise.
 

00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:26.450
Well I will not speak too much
about this.

00:20:26.450 --> 00:20:31.082
The Second Treatise is
really the big text everybody

00:20:31.082 --> 00:20:32.519
reads and cites.
 

00:20:32.519 --> 00:20:37.403
But the First Treatise
takes on a book published by

00:20:37.403 --> 00:20:39.460
1680 by Robert Filmer.
 

00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:45.157
This looks to me a very archaic
book, but surprisingly it is

00:20:45.157 --> 00:20:46.798
still in print.
 

00:20:46.798 --> 00:20:51.141
You go on Google and you can
buy Robert Filmer's book,

00:20:51.141 --> 00:20:52.779
Patriarcha.
 

00:20:52.779 --> 00:20:56.353
Well I don't necessarily
recommend it because I think

00:20:56.353 --> 00:21:00.516
this is really archaic,
and I don't think it's got any

00:21:00.516 --> 00:21:05.030
major contribution beyond
challenging Locke to formulate a

00:21:05.030 --> 00:21:08.159
strong position against;
that's, I think,

00:21:08.159 --> 00:21:11.868
the only reason why you may
want to read Patriarcha.

00:21:11.868 --> 00:21:17.085
Well he was very much for
absolutism and the absolute

00:21:17.085 --> 00:21:22.000
monarchy, and he advocated
actually inequality.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.750
He said, "God set some men
above others";

00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:28.068
and he meant men. Right?
 

00:21:28.068 --> 00:21:31.656
Men are set over women,
and older people,

00:21:31.656 --> 00:21:35.782
like me, are set over younger
people, like you.

00:21:35.782 --> 00:21:36.680
Right?
 

00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:40.259
And the king over everybody
else, right?

00:21:40.259 --> 00:21:43.818
So this inequality of power is
coming from God.

00:21:43.818 --> 00:21:49.336
God decided that Adam inherits
the earth, and then descendents

00:21:49.336 --> 00:21:54.855
of Adam, the sons and grandsons,
receive their share of earth.

00:21:54.855 --> 00:21:55.759
Right?
 

00:21:55.759 --> 00:22:01.223
So you have to show your family
tree, going back to Adam,

00:22:01.223 --> 00:22:06.590
who received the world as a
grant, and who was the first

00:22:06.590 --> 00:22:07.470
king.
 

00:22:07.470 --> 00:22:12.663
So the kings should trace their
family trees back to the first

00:22:12.663 --> 00:22:14.623
person of grace of God.
 

00:22:14.623 --> 00:22:15.390
Right?
 

00:22:15.390 --> 00:22:18.310
So there was a scripture
argument.

00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:19.019
Right?
 

00:22:19.019 --> 00:22:24.316
God vested paternal authority
in Adam, gave the earth as a

00:22:24.316 --> 00:22:25.710
grant to him.
 

00:22:25.710 --> 00:22:30.088
And the monarchical absolute
power is inherited this way;

00:22:30.088 --> 00:22:32.910
there is a descent of the
monarchical power.

00:22:32.910 --> 00:22:38.150
As I said, I see very little
relevance of this argument.

00:22:38.150 --> 00:22:44.837
So I--but certainly it was
important for Locke to have a

00:22:44.837 --> 00:22:51.282
straw man he could face his
argument against--probably

00:22:51.282 --> 00:22:56.269
spends too much time debating
Filmer.

00:22:56.269 --> 00:22:59.776
And you may have been a bit
concerned about these

00:22:59.776 --> 00:23:03.939
theological controversies and
theological arguments in the

00:23:03.939 --> 00:23:07.210
book,
but otherwise he's really

00:23:07.210 --> 00:23:13.509
formulating the first big ideas
for modern democratic theory.

00:23:13.509 --> 00:23:25.288
Okay, so now Locke engages
Filmer on a number of levels.

00:23:25.288 --> 00:23:29.515
It actually engages him on the
theological level,

00:23:29.515 --> 00:23:33.036
and he said,
"Well, it's untrue that

00:23:33.036 --> 00:23:36.029
Adam received land as a grant.
 

00:23:36.029 --> 00:23:42.250
It was mankind who received the
land as a grant from God."

00:23:42.250 --> 00:23:50.270
And then he moves on and he
kind of makes a more technical

00:23:50.270 --> 00:23:51.818
argument.
 

00:23:51.818 --> 00:23:56.144
He said, "Well even if we
assume that it was one single

00:23:56.144 --> 00:23:59.368
male who received land and all
authority,

00:23:59.368 --> 00:24:03.818
how on earth you can trace
yourself back to this?"

00:24:03.818 --> 00:24:07.118
This is not a real good way to
legitimate somebody.

00:24:07.118 --> 00:24:11.791
How can Charles II shows that
he has the answers through this

00:24:11.791 --> 00:24:12.259
way?
 

00:24:12.259 --> 00:24:14.880
So that is not the right way to
do.

00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:17.628
And then he said,
"Well, even if it could be

00:24:17.628 --> 00:24:19.577
done, it would be silly to do
that.

00:24:19.577 --> 00:24:20.150
Right?
 

00:24:20.150 --> 00:24:23.230
Just because somebody is the
proper ancestor,

00:24:23.230 --> 00:24:26.519
should not have--should not be
the sovereign.

00:24:26.519 --> 00:24:28.611
What if that person is a jerk?
 

00:24:28.611 --> 00:24:29.098
Right?
 

00:24:29.098 --> 00:24:33.621
Then you really want to have
the right people to exercise

00:24:33.621 --> 00:24:34.913
authority."
 

00:24:34.913 --> 00:24:35.640
Right?
 

00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:41.285
It's, in his time,
you know, a very daring

00:24:41.285 --> 00:24:42.798
argument.
 

00:24:42.798 --> 00:24:48.112
Now let's have a look at the
Second Treatise,

00:24:48.112 --> 00:24:52.798
and the major themes--what he's
engaged in.

00:24:52.798 --> 00:24:56.196
Like Hobbes,
he begins with the statement:

00:24:56.196 --> 00:25:00.090
We are all born equal,
and he has free--free and

00:25:00.090 --> 00:25:00.920
equal.
 

00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:04.076
But, as we will see,
he draws a very different

00:25:04.076 --> 00:25:07.866
conclusion than Hobbes did,
or by and large a different

00:25:07.866 --> 00:25:08.920
conclusion.
 

00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:15.945
And then he does agree with
Locke that we need a common

00:25:15.945 --> 00:25:21.944
superior, a sovereign;
a superior is necessary to

00:25:21.944 --> 00:25:24.598
avoid the state of war.
 

00:25:24.598 --> 00:25:28.420
Then he develops a fascinating
theory of property,

00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:33.638
what we have to deal with,
and then he makes this

00:25:33.638 --> 00:25:40.490
path-breaking argument that what
we need is rule by majority.

00:25:40.490 --> 00:25:44.612
He does not quite identify what
that majority is.

00:25:44.612 --> 00:25:45.298
Right?
 

00:25:45.298 --> 00:25:50.604
This is not popular sovereignty
yet, but the idea of rule by

00:25:50.604 --> 00:25:55.818
majority for the first time is
formulated by John Locke.

00:25:55.818 --> 00:26:01.160
And acceptance of authority can
be done only by consent,

00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:05.220
and what is needed--and this is
the very big contribution of

00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:07.405
Locke--
a separation of power,

00:26:07.405 --> 00:26:08.829
checks and balances.
 

00:26:08.829 --> 00:26:09.400
Right?
 

00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:13.428
This is what is completely
missing in Hobbes,

00:26:13.428 --> 00:26:17.640
and he's making this
path-breaking argument.

00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:20.880
So we are all born free and
equal.

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:23.430
Let me speak to this a little.
 

00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:26.960
Now what is political power?
 

00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:30.590
And he defines the three
elements of political power.

00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:31.150
Right?
 

00:26:31.150 --> 00:26:37.308
Well this is the right to make
law.

00:26:37.308 --> 00:26:42.086
There is also execution of law,
and there is also--politics

00:26:42.086 --> 00:26:46.371
means the defense of the
commonwealth against outside

00:26:46.371 --> 00:26:47.358
enemies.
 

00:26:47.358 --> 00:26:52.009
There are the three functions
politics is serving.

00:26:52.009 --> 00:26:56.428
And this will be very important
in his sort of divisions of

00:26:56.428 --> 00:26:57.798
powers, as such.
 

00:26:57.798 --> 00:27:04.278
Now, well if we want to
understand what political power

00:27:04.278 --> 00:27:07.480
is,
we have to see the origins of

00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:11.704
political power,
and to try to understand why on

00:27:11.704 --> 00:27:15.170
earth people from the state of
nature,

00:27:15.170 --> 00:27:19.785
where they were free and equal,
move into civil society where

00:27:19.785 --> 00:27:23.170
they surrender some of their
freedom and,

00:27:23.170 --> 00:27:26.196
we will see,
will surrender some of their

00:27:26.196 --> 00:27:27.028
equality.
 

00:27:27.028 --> 00:27:33.650
So what is the origins of this
equality?

00:27:33.650 --> 00:27:37.738
Well the first argument is very
much counter-Hobbes.

00:27:37.738 --> 00:27:38.380
Right?
 

00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:44.702
Men are all made by God,
the omnipotent,

00:27:44.702 --> 00:27:46.000
right?
 

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:50.230
And we are his property;
a kind of theological argument.

00:27:50.230 --> 00:27:54.121
And we are not--have not been
created for the pleasures of one

00:27:54.121 --> 00:27:54.759
another.
 

00:27:54.759 --> 00:27:59.299
So there should not be any man
who is a superior,

00:27:59.299 --> 00:28:00.720
by principle.
 

00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:02.950
Because we are free, right?
 

00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:06.559
Locke is a liberal, right?
 

00:28:06.559 --> 00:28:08.910
Hobbes is a conservative.
 

00:28:08.910 --> 00:28:14.349
So what we are experiencing now
is the transition of philosophy

00:28:14.349 --> 00:28:17.509
from conservativism to
liberalism;

00:28:17.509 --> 00:28:22.976
and liberalism,
of course, will emphasize

00:28:22.976 --> 00:28:28.990
particularly freedom is the
primary value.

00:28:28.990 --> 00:28:34.351
And in the state of nature,
he said, we were all governed

00:28:34.351 --> 00:28:35.500
by reason.
 

00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:41.019
And that actually sort
of--because we are all

00:28:41.019 --> 00:28:45.660
reasonable, we are born
reasonable;

00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:48.117
we are born to be able to be
rational.

00:28:48.117 --> 00:28:48.650
Right?
 

00:28:48.650 --> 00:28:52.817
And we should be able to
understand that we are not

00:28:52.817 --> 00:28:55.318
supposed to harm each other.
 

00:28:55.318 --> 00:28:59.884
You see, this is a very
different argument than what we

00:28:59.884 --> 00:29:02.673
have seen from Hobbes,
on Tuesday.

00:29:02.673 --> 00:29:03.519
Right?
 

00:29:03.519 --> 00:29:08.445
Hobbes said that we are
actually learning morality out

00:29:08.445 --> 00:29:14.210
by interacting with others who
are desiring the same stuff what

00:29:14.210 --> 00:29:15.140
we do.
 

00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:18.538
We are learning it from
struggle, right?

00:29:18.538 --> 00:29:23.105
It does not assume that this
comes out of our rationality,

00:29:23.105 --> 00:29:26.630
that we are reasonable and by
nature good.

00:29:26.630 --> 00:29:28.740
He does assume that we are
reasonable.

00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:32.651
Therefore why on earth we
should not know that we should

00:29:32.651 --> 00:29:33.858
respect others?
 

00:29:33.858 --> 00:29:39.886
Well, but--and this then is
where Locke comes the closest to

00:29:39.886 --> 00:29:44.916
converge with Hobbes--
well there is on the other hand

00:29:44.916 --> 00:29:47.910
a danger that there will be a
war,

00:29:47.910 --> 00:29:54.284
and in order to avoid war this
is why we will subject ourselves

00:29:54.284 --> 00:29:59.220
to an authority and leave the
state of nature.

00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:07.240
But he also makes a claim just
to distance himself from Hobbes.

00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:11.690
He said it's not that the state
of nature is necessarily war.

00:30:11.690 --> 00:30:14.619
We have to make a distinction
between the state of war and

00:30:14.619 --> 00:30:17.757
state of nature because in the
state of nature we are good and

00:30:17.757 --> 00:30:22.001
reasonable,
but nevertheless it can turn

00:30:22.001 --> 00:30:24.568
into a state of war.
 

00:30:24.568 --> 00:30:30.894
And that's why we will have to
join civil society and accept an

00:30:30.894 --> 00:30:32.118
authority.
 

00:30:32.118 --> 00:30:35.779
Well, and now comes again a
very big difference.

00:30:35.779 --> 00:30:40.656
So he accepts the danger of
war--he lived in times of

00:30:40.656 --> 00:30:46.660
war--and he accepts that we need
an authority because of this.

00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:51.910
Now, but--and now here comes
the big differences.

00:30:51.910 --> 00:30:59.896
Well we subject ourselves to
authority of others,

00:30:59.896 --> 00:31:05.555
but this has to be done by
consent.

00:31:05.555 --> 00:31:07.220
Right?
 

00:31:07.220 --> 00:31:12.526
Those who are accepting a
sovereign have to consent to

00:31:12.526 --> 00:31:15.930
their subjugation,
to authority.

00:31:15.930 --> 00:31:20.538
And the last citation is also
extremely important:

00:31:20.538 --> 00:31:25.993
"Freedom of man under
government is to have a standing

00:31:25.993 --> 00:31:30.476
rule of liberty,
common to everyone of that

00:31:30.476 --> 00:31:34.476
society,
and made by a legislative power

00:31:34.476 --> 00:31:36.435
erected in it."
 

00:31:36.435 --> 00:31:37.220
Right?
 

00:31:37.220 --> 00:31:40.741
So the legislative power,
now this is the source of

00:31:40.741 --> 00:31:44.194
sovereign, is somehow in a
proper way constituted.

00:31:44.194 --> 00:31:44.900
Right?
 

00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:50.218
This was not a problem really
for Hobbes, not much,

00:31:50.218 --> 00:31:51.068
right?
 

00:31:51.068 --> 00:31:56.603
We could see that we'll be
simply conferring sovereignty to

00:31:56.603 --> 00:31:58.130
a single king.
 

00:31:58.130 --> 00:32:01.605
Now Locke is very interested
how the sovereign,

00:32:01.605 --> 00:32:05.230
the source of power to pass
legislation, is being

00:32:05.230 --> 00:32:06.440
constituted.
 

00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:09.596
And again he's
emphasizing--which was not in

00:32:09.596 --> 00:32:13.413
Hobbes--what is important is
standing rules to assure

00:32:13.413 --> 00:32:14.001
liberty.
 

00:32:14.001 --> 00:32:14.809
Right?
 

00:32:14.809 --> 00:32:17.430
Not simply survival, right?
 

00:32:17.430 --> 00:32:20.358
Though we know Hobbes had it a
more complex way.

00:32:20.358 --> 00:32:26.900
But liberty is the major issue,
what we are seeking for.

00:32:26.900 --> 00:32:30.229
Well, and then he comes with an
interesting idea:

00:32:30.229 --> 00:32:34.321
Why do we submit ourselves to
authority and seek protections

00:32:34.321 --> 00:32:35.710
for our liberty?
 

00:32:35.710 --> 00:32:39.868
Because we want to protect our
property.

00:32:39.868 --> 00:32:44.190
That's the role of the public
authority: to protect property.

00:32:44.190 --> 00:32:48.938
It's a very realistic and
important assumption--a question

00:32:48.938 --> 00:32:53.019
in which he and Karl Marx would
probably agree.

00:32:53.019 --> 00:32:55.269
What is the role of the
government?

00:32:55.269 --> 00:32:58.318
To guarantee the sacredness of
private property.

00:32:58.318 --> 00:33:03.493
And he has interesting ideas
about what property is,

00:33:03.493 --> 00:33:06.640
where that it is coming from.
 

00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:07.549
Very important.
 

00:33:07.549 --> 00:33:10.098
This foreshadows Adam Smith in
some ways.

00:33:10.098 --> 00:33:13.519
Also foreshadows Karl Marx in
another way.

00:33:13.519 --> 00:33:18.332
Well he starts with this idea
that man had given the world to

00:33:18.332 --> 00:33:21.701
man in common,
and therefore all the fruits

00:33:21.701 --> 00:33:24.990
belong to each member of the
society.

00:33:24.990 --> 00:33:29.269
It's almost a socialist
ideology, right?

00:33:29.269 --> 00:33:35.680
And he continues along these
lines.

00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:42.028
He said every man has a
property in his own person,

00:33:42.028 --> 00:33:47.359
and the labor of what you
produce is yours.

00:33:47.359 --> 00:33:48.630
Right?
 

00:33:48.630 --> 00:33:51.750
The product of your labor
belongs to you.

00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:55.640
And we will see it's the first
formulation what we will learn

00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:59.401
from Adam Smith and Karl Marx as
the labor theory of value.

00:33:59.401 --> 00:34:00.048
Right?
 

00:34:00.048 --> 00:34:09.284
Labor belongs to the laborer,
as such, because it was created

00:34:09.284 --> 00:34:14.221
by what is yours;
the only thing what certainly

00:34:14.221 --> 00:34:17.896
is yours, and this is your own
body, and your laboring

00:34:17.896 --> 00:34:18.730
capacity.
 

00:34:18.730 --> 00:34:22.175
He said, and I quote:
"This labor being the

00:34:22.175 --> 00:34:25.619
unquestionable property of the
laborer."

00:34:25.619 --> 00:34:29.289
And then this is a beautiful
citation,

00:34:29.289 --> 00:34:33.818
I just love it:
"Though the water running

00:34:33.818 --> 00:34:40.291
in the fountain be everyone's,
yet who can doubt but that in

00:34:40.291 --> 00:34:45.400
the pitcher is his only who drew
it out?"

00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:47.349
Bingo, right?
 

00:34:47.349 --> 00:34:49.972
How crisply,
in one sentence,

00:34:49.972 --> 00:34:55.217
he can capture this wonderful
idea that labor creates the

00:34:55.217 --> 00:34:55.779
value.
 

00:34:55.779 --> 00:34:56.809
Right?
 

00:34:56.809 --> 00:34:58.949
Wonderfully done.
 

00:34:58.949 --> 00:35:06.213
And, of course,
a great influence on Adam Smith

00:35:06.213 --> 00:35:08.739
and Karl Marx.
 

00:35:08.739 --> 00:35:12.768
Well, but there are also limits
on private property.

00:35:12.768 --> 00:35:16.190
Again, he almost reads like a
socialist.

00:35:16.190 --> 00:35:21.280
He said, "Anyone grows as
much as he will.

00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:24.911
To this I answer,
'not so'."

00:35:24.911 --> 00:35:25.820
Right?
 

00:35:25.820 --> 00:35:29.159
"God has given us all
things richly."

00:35:29.159 --> 00:35:33.110
Well, but how far has he given
it to us?

00:35:33.110 --> 00:35:35.219
To enjoy, right?
 

00:35:35.219 --> 00:35:40.018
And whatever is beyond this is
more than your share.

00:35:40.018 --> 00:35:45.664
You have only in your--belongs
to you, what you can actually

00:35:45.664 --> 00:35:48.929
enjoy;
nothing what you accumulate.

00:35:48.929 --> 00:35:51.460
That's a very radical idea.
 

00:35:51.460 --> 00:35:54.909
He will back-pedal in a minute;
I will show you how he

00:35:54.909 --> 00:35:57.900
back-pedals out of this very
radical idea.

00:35:57.900 --> 00:36:06.260
The chief matter is,
of course, earth.

00:36:06.260 --> 00:36:09.960
He said it's absolutely obvious
that the property belongs to

00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:11.655
those who can cultivate it.
 

00:36:11.655 --> 00:36:12.219
Right?
 

00:36:12.219 --> 00:36:15.472
"As much land as man
tills, plants,

00:36:15.472 --> 00:36:19.474
improves, cultivates and can
use the products of,

00:36:19.474 --> 00:36:22.309
so much is his property."
 

00:36:22.309 --> 00:36:26.675
So the land belongs--it's not a
notion of private ownership of

00:36:26.675 --> 00:36:30.110
the land, it's an ownership by
the cultivator.

00:36:30.110 --> 00:36:32.887
And also let me just point
out--I'm running out of

00:36:32.887 --> 00:36:35.552
time--there is a very important
difference here.

00:36:35.552 --> 00:36:36.119
Right?
 

00:36:36.119 --> 00:36:40.360
What is central for Locke's
argument is the abundance.

00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:43.925
He can make this argument
because the primary assumption

00:36:43.925 --> 00:36:47.556
is that what we desire is
available in great abundance to

00:36:47.556 --> 00:36:48.010
us.
 

00:36:48.010 --> 00:36:51.126
We have seen that Hobbes had
the opposite idea.

00:36:51.126 --> 00:36:51.670
Right?
 

00:36:51.670 --> 00:36:55.690
We are fighting each other
because what we actually desire

00:36:55.690 --> 00:36:58.371
is a scarce good,
too many people want,

00:36:58.371 --> 00:37:00.983
and then we kill each other to
get it.

00:37:00.983 --> 00:37:01.829
Right?
 

00:37:01.829 --> 00:37:04.882
So there is a scarcity
assumption in Hobbes,

00:37:04.882 --> 00:37:08.858
and there is an abundance
hypothesis in Locke,

00:37:08.858 --> 00:37:14.423
and you have to make up your
mind who is appealing to you

00:37:14.423 --> 00:37:15.219
more.
 

00:37:15.219 --> 00:37:19.802
Do you think that the scarcity
assumption is a better one,

00:37:19.802 --> 00:37:25.030
or the abundance argument is an
empirically more appealing one?

00:37:25.030 --> 00:37:28.192
Well, and then,
as I said, now he back-pedals.

00:37:28.192 --> 00:37:30.300
He knows he's going too far.
 

00:37:30.300 --> 00:37:34.949
He said, but God gave the world
to man in common.

00:37:34.949 --> 00:37:40.141
But since he gave them for the
benefit, well he basically did

00:37:40.141 --> 00:37:42.650
it to the industrious ones.
 

00:37:42.650 --> 00:37:46.760
So those who work harder should
get more, rather than who do not

00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:47.869
work that hard.
 

00:37:47.869 --> 00:37:53.420
And then he actually will go
further.

00:37:53.420 --> 00:37:57.289
Well labor creates value, right?
 

00:37:57.289 --> 00:38:01.646
And the argument is that
everything, what has been

00:38:01.646 --> 00:38:06.005
created as a value,
has been created by--or almost

00:38:06.005 --> 00:38:09.704
everything;
that's an interesting kind of

00:38:09.704 --> 00:38:11.336
equation at the end.
 

00:38:11.336 --> 00:38:11.989
Right?
 

00:38:11.989 --> 00:38:15.530
The products of the earth,
useful to life,

00:38:15.530 --> 00:38:20.280
of man, he said nine-tenths are
the effects of labor.

00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:25.387
Well I don't know if we can
base it on--well what that

00:38:25.387 --> 00:38:30.400
really means and why on earth he
makes that claim.

00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:34.954
But--now and here comes a very
big qualification--with the

00:38:34.954 --> 00:38:38.391
invention of money,
accumulation of property

00:38:38.391 --> 00:38:39.750
becomes possible.
 

00:38:39.750 --> 00:38:40.630
Right?
 

00:38:40.630 --> 00:38:45.815
And therefore as accumulation
of money occurs,

00:38:45.815 --> 00:38:52.960
well then wealth can be hoarded
up without injury to anyone.

00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:58.119
And this becomes again very
important for liberal theory.

00:38:58.119 --> 00:39:01.813
You can't do anything by which
you do not injure somebody else,

00:39:01.813 --> 00:39:02.289
right?
 

00:39:02.289 --> 00:39:05.913
That should be prohibited and
the government should step in,

00:39:05.913 --> 00:39:08.614
when they sense injury against
somebody else.

00:39:08.614 --> 00:39:09.230
Right?
 

00:39:09.230 --> 00:39:15.083
Well now in order to preserve
property, you will have to

00:39:15.083 --> 00:39:20.619
transfer power to the community,
to civil society.

00:39:20.619 --> 00:39:23.349
There are some very important
arguments here.

00:39:23.349 --> 00:39:26.552
It has to be by settled,
standing rules,

00:39:26.552 --> 00:39:27.210
right?
 

00:39:27.210 --> 00:39:31.175
It has to be written down,
it has to be agreed upon,

00:39:31.175 --> 00:39:34.922
and it has to be permanency;
there must be a permanency

00:39:34.922 --> 00:39:35.630
closed rule.
 

00:39:35.630 --> 00:39:38.239
You need a predictable
environment.

00:39:38.239 --> 00:39:42.670
And it has to be the same to
all parties.

00:39:42.670 --> 00:39:46.230
You cannot make a law which
applies to the serfs and a law

00:39:46.230 --> 00:39:48.230
which applies to the noblemen.
 

00:39:48.230 --> 00:39:55.909
It has to be the same law for
everyone, as such.

00:39:55.909 --> 00:40:02.019
Well, and this is the origin of
legislative and executive power

00:40:02.019 --> 00:40:04.090
of civil societies.
 

00:40:04.090 --> 00:40:10.172
Well there is a difference
between absolute monarchy and

00:40:10.172 --> 00:40:13.268
constitutional monarchies.
 

00:40:13.268 --> 00:40:17.873
He said in an absolute monarchy
you can appeal to the law to

00:40:17.873 --> 00:40:22.869
restrain violence against you by
another subject of the crown.

00:40:22.869 --> 00:40:27.835
But he said in an absolute
monarchy you cannot really

00:40:27.835 --> 00:40:30.320
appeal against the king.
 

00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:33.635
That's what--you know,
in Communist societies you

00:40:33.635 --> 00:40:35.637
could not sue the government.
 

00:40:35.637 --> 00:40:36.260
Right?
 

00:40:36.260 --> 00:40:40.771
Even in Stalinist Russia you
could sue your neighbor if your

00:40:40.771 --> 00:40:43.829
neighbor did steal something
from you.

00:40:43.829 --> 00:40:46.525
But if the government did steal
anything from you,

00:40:46.525 --> 00:40:48.670
you could not sue the Soviet
government.

00:40:48.670 --> 00:40:49.219
Right?
 

00:40:49.219 --> 00:40:52.599
But a democratic system
means--this is foreshadowed

00:40:52.599 --> 00:40:54.762
here--you can sue the
government.

00:40:54.762 --> 00:40:55.440
Right?
 

00:40:55.440 --> 00:40:58.126
And, of course,
in the United States you can

00:40:58.126 --> 00:40:59.440
sue the government.
 

00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:00.639
Well you can try.
 

00:41:00.639 --> 00:41:04.250
It will not always work
but--good luck.

00:41:04.250 --> 00:41:09.677
Well and then he says--and this
is fun and very,

00:41:09.677 --> 00:41:16.376
very good--well "to think
that men are so foolish that

00:41:16.376 --> 00:41:23.769
they take care to avoid what
mischiefs can be done to them--

00:41:23.769 --> 00:41:27.050
"--like your neighbor--
"polecats or foxes,

00:41:27.050 --> 00:41:31.768
but are content not to think of
the safety of the work by

00:41:31.768 --> 00:41:33.789
lions" is crazy.
 

00:41:33.789 --> 00:41:37.050
Lions are the kings,
the big authorities.

00:41:37.050 --> 00:41:41.764
So don't just seek laws which
protect you against your

00:41:41.764 --> 00:41:46.744
neighbor, seek laws which
protects you against those in a

00:41:46.744 --> 00:41:49.590
position of authority and power.
 

00:41:49.590 --> 00:41:50.570
Right.
 

00:41:50.570 --> 00:41:57.469
And there will be no civil
society unless this happens.

00:41:57.469 --> 00:42:02.454
Well he advocates then the
principle of rule by the

00:42:02.454 --> 00:42:03.351
majority.
 

00:42:03.351 --> 00:42:04.250
Right?
 

00:42:04.250 --> 00:42:08.606
Well what we need--a consent of
every individual who made the

00:42:08.606 --> 00:42:12.018
community in order to create
legitimate rule.

00:42:12.018 --> 00:42:24.458
And once this is arrived at,
consent, that will bound

00:42:24.458 --> 00:42:27.329
everybody.
 

00:42:27.329 --> 00:42:32.440
And one can be subjected to
authority only by consent.

00:42:32.440 --> 00:42:36.876
Well this consent can be tacit;
it is not necessarily always

00:42:36.876 --> 00:42:37.630
explicit.
 

00:42:37.630 --> 00:42:39.730
You are born in the United
States.

00:42:39.730 --> 00:42:43.556
You did not approve the
Constitution of the United

00:42:43.556 --> 00:42:44.260
States.
 

00:42:44.260 --> 00:42:46.583
Nevertheless,
you have to obey the

00:42:46.583 --> 00:42:49.119
Constitution of the United
States.

00:42:49.119 --> 00:42:51.329
You have one chance not to do
so.

00:42:51.329 --> 00:42:55.467
You can move to Afghanistan,
if that's what you prefer.

00:42:55.467 --> 00:42:56.079
Right?
 

00:42:56.079 --> 00:42:58.929
So you don't have to go by
American law;

00:42:58.929 --> 00:43:04.094
you can live under Islamic law
when you move to a country ruled

00:43:04.094 --> 00:43:05.510
by Islamic law.
 

00:43:05.510 --> 00:43:08.896
And then the final major
contribution,

00:43:08.896 --> 00:43:11.369
the separation of powers.
 

00:43:11.369 --> 00:43:15.094
And he makes a distinction
between three types of powers:

00:43:15.094 --> 00:43:17.487
legislative,
executive and federative

00:43:17.487 --> 00:43:18.219
powers.
 

00:43:18.219 --> 00:43:20.679
That's very different from
Montesquieu,

00:43:20.679 --> 00:43:23.119
and different from the American
Constitution--

00:43:23.119 --> 00:43:27.255
that the three branches are
legislative, executive and

00:43:27.255 --> 00:43:28.659
juridical power.
 

00:43:28.659 --> 00:43:33.559
He makes a claim that the third
branch is federative power.

00:43:33.559 --> 00:43:38.239
Federative power is a defense
against outside enemies.

00:43:38.239 --> 00:43:40.650
And he said,
"Look, what is important,

00:43:40.650 --> 00:43:43.577
that legislative power and
executive power has to be

00:43:43.577 --> 00:43:45.300
separated from each other.
 

00:43:45.300 --> 00:43:49.806
It is absolutism if it is the
same person, or the same

00:43:49.806 --> 00:43:55.420
authority, which passes the law
and which also executes the law;

00:43:55.420 --> 00:43:59.090
we have to separate those."
 

00:43:59.090 --> 00:44:06.090
And well I don't have time to
go into this;

00:44:06.090 --> 00:44:08.969
it's clear enough.
 

00:44:08.969 --> 00:44:12.170
And then there is the kind of
federative powers.

00:44:12.170 --> 00:44:16.010
As far as the federative powers
are concerned he said,

00:44:16.010 --> 00:44:19.942
"Well the federative
powers may not be necessarily

00:44:19.942 --> 00:44:22.710
separated from the executive
branch.

00:44:22.710 --> 00:44:26.297
It can be actually held by the
executive branch,

00:44:26.297 --> 00:44:27.518
as such."
 

00:44:27.518 --> 00:44:32.175
As in many ways it is the--it's
very unclear in the United

00:44:32.175 --> 00:44:36.012
States who actually has these
federative powers.

00:44:36.012 --> 00:44:36.829
Right?
 

00:44:36.829 --> 00:44:42.440
By law it is the Congress which
can declare only laws-- wars.

00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:45.643
But, as we have seen,
the United States was engaged

00:44:45.643 --> 00:44:48.268
in a number of major military
actions,

00:44:48.268 --> 00:44:51.847
what commonly we call wars,
though the war was never

00:44:51.847 --> 00:44:52.478
declared.
 

00:44:52.478 --> 00:44:53.110
Right?
 

00:44:53.110 --> 00:44:58.347
And it was the executive branch
which de facto declared

00:44:58.347 --> 00:45:03.195
war and conducts war,
occasionally without the

00:45:03.195 --> 00:45:09.929
consent--occasionally against
the will of the House and the

00:45:09.929 --> 00:45:11.090
Senate.
 

00:45:11.090 --> 00:45:13.429
So it's a complex issue.
 

00:45:13.429 --> 00:45:18.556
But I think he was quite right
that often the federative power

00:45:18.556 --> 00:45:22.590
and the executive power are the
same. 

00:45:22.590 --> 00:45:28.000

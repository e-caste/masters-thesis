00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.777
Professor David Blight:
On the 4^(th) of July,

00:00:18.777 --> 00:00:23.340
1854, in an outdoor park in
Framingham,

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.990
Massachusetts,
which is fifteen,

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:33.819
twenty miles west of Boston,
William Lloyd Garrison and the

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:40.060
Massachusetts Anti-Slavery
Society built a stage.

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:41.330
They had a huge turnout.

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:53.861
And Garrison and his group
performed an act of abolitionist

00:00:53.861 --> 00:00:55.260
theater.

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.490
Anthony Burns had just been
returned to slavery in Virginia.

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:09.961
The Kansas-Nebraska Act had
just been passed in the month of

00:01:09.961 --> 00:01:13.798
May.
Behind him, on the stage--a

00:01:13.798 --> 00:01:19.567
huge array--was first the
insignia of the State of

00:01:19.567 --> 00:01:24.340
Virginia,
then an insignia of the State

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.787
of Massachusetts,
a banner on one side that read

00:01:29.787 --> 00:01:35.162
"Redeem Massachusetts."
Hanging from that sign was

00:01:35.162 --> 00:01:40.797
something labeled "the crepe of
servitude"--nothing very subtle

00:01:40.797 --> 00:01:42.070
about this.

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:49.708
And two flags were on other
side of the rostrum,

00:01:49.708 --> 00:01:53.800
one labeled Kansas and the
other labeled Nebraska,

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:05.521
and behind Garrison was a very
large United States flag,

00:02:05.521 --> 00:02:10.657
upside down.
Now, this was political

00:02:10.657 --> 00:02:17.669
theater, directed by a man who,
as you will remember,

00:02:17.669 --> 00:02:22.614
denounced political parties,
said that participation in

00:02:22.614 --> 00:02:27.010
political parties was complicity
with slavery.

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:36.470
Garrison first read from
scripture--Old Testament,

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.911
Deuteronomy.
Then he proceeded to,

00:02:40.911 --> 00:02:45.620
in three segments,
to burn documents.

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.665
He first held up in his hand
what he said was a copy of The

00:02:49.665 --> 00:02:53.703
Fugitive Slave Act,
which he burned in his hand

00:02:53.703 --> 00:02:58.660
with a lighted match,
threw the ashes on the floor,

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.080
stomped on the ashes,
and the crowd shouted "Amen."

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:08.932
Then he held in his hands the
documents for the rendition--he

00:03:08.932 --> 00:03:11.563
said it was a copy of the
document for the rendition of

00:03:11.563 --> 00:03:14.554
Anthony Burns,
returning Burns as a fugitive

00:03:14.554 --> 00:03:17.192
slave to Virginia.
He burned that,

00:03:17.192 --> 00:03:20.948
threw the ashes on the floor,
stomped on them,

00:03:20.948 --> 00:03:23.620
and the crowd shouted "Amen."

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:31.385
Then he pulled out a copy of
the United States Constitution,

00:03:31.385 --> 00:03:35.878
which he announced--as he had
announced many times over in his

00:03:35.878 --> 00:03:39.517
newspaper,
The Liberator--he called

00:03:39.517 --> 00:03:44.479
it a, quote, "covenant with
death, an agreement with Hell,

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:49.259
so perish all compromisers with
tyranny."

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:52.936
He burned it famously,
or infamously,

00:03:52.936 --> 00:03:59.166
stomped on the ashes all over
the stage, and the crowd shouted

00:03:59.166 --> 00:04:00.290
"Amen."

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:11.610
The Kansas-Nebraska Act had
fuelled a political fervor that

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:19.070
now could never be bottled up
again, it could never be put

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:24.470
back on its shelf.
Why?

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:29.589
Why was that Kansas-Nebraska
Act so troublesome?

00:04:29.589 --> 00:04:32.760
Let me pick that up where I
left you off the other day.

00:04:40.769 --> 00:04:44.001
Now remember,
the Kansas-Nebraska Act had two

00:04:44.001 --> 00:04:47.600
simple resolutions,
although it came about through

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.510
a heightening process.

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:56.257
The first was that it
explicitly repealed the

00:04:56.257 --> 00:05:00.060
36º30' parallel,
or Missouri Compromise line,

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.626
what Northerners--anti-slavery
abolitionist or even,

00:05:03.626 --> 00:05:06.213
in some cases,
hardly-aware-of-slavery

00:05:06.213 --> 00:05:09.290
Northerners--had always referred
as the,

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:13.093
quote, "sacred pledge."
That sacred pledge was now

00:05:13.093 --> 00:05:14.520
thirty-four years old.

00:05:18.029 --> 00:05:22.050
Everybody in the United States
Congress had grown up with it.

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:27.040
It was a template,
it was an assumption;

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:30.600
not unlike you could name
certain great resolutions or

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:34.362
assumptions that became almost
standard parts of American

00:05:34.362 --> 00:05:38.389
political culture,
perhaps in your lifetime,

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:43.583
certainly in my lifetime.
Certain aspects of the New

00:05:43.583 --> 00:05:48.083
Deal, we thought,
were basic American political

00:05:48.083 --> 00:05:53.463
assumptions--like Social
Security, but recently that one

00:05:53.463 --> 00:05:56.720
got challenged.
You could think of others.

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:00.373
The right to collective
bargaining out of the Wagner Act

00:06:00.373 --> 00:06:03.810
in the 1930s.
You can think of others.

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:06.806
Some would say Roe v
Wade, some would say

00:06:06.806 --> 00:06:09.994
affirmative action,
some would say other aspects of

00:06:09.994 --> 00:06:12.800
our political culture born of
the 1960s.

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:18.879
Some would say the '64 Civil
Rights Act, et cetera.

00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:22.999
The Missouri Compromise Line,
as people imagined this slavery

00:06:22.999 --> 00:06:26.364
question in the West,
had been seen by Northerners

00:06:26.364 --> 00:06:30.130
as, quote, "a sacred pledge."
That was now repealed

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:32.775
explicitly in this very
sectionalized,

00:06:32.775 --> 00:06:36.205
divided vote in the
Kansas-Nebraska Act to set up

00:06:36.205 --> 00:06:40.394
the Kansas-Nebraska Territories.
The second part,

00:06:40.394 --> 00:06:44.543
was, of course,
a declaration that any state

00:06:44.543 --> 00:06:50.430
produced, created from Kansas
and Nebraska would be created on

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:54.290
a principle of popular
sovereignty.

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:58.532
There would be a popular
referendum at some stage in the

00:06:58.532 --> 00:07:02.079
territorial process,
to be worked out later.

00:07:02.079 --> 00:07:05.162
It passed the U.S.
Senate thirty-seven to

00:07:05.162 --> 00:07:07.818
fourteen.
That's in great part because

00:07:07.818 --> 00:07:11.694
the Kansas-Nebraska Act became
an absolute test of Democratic

00:07:11.694 --> 00:07:14.860
Party loyalty,
which Stephen Douglas demanded.

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:20.357
He didn't get all Democrats to
support it but he got most of

00:07:20.357 --> 00:07:21.834
them.
And the Whig Party,

00:07:21.834 --> 00:07:24.310
by 1864, in what was still a
fledgling two-party system,

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:28.525
now greatly challenged by a
third party called the American

00:07:28.525 --> 00:07:31.578
Party, or known more
euphemistically as the

00:07:31.578 --> 00:07:35.620
Know-Nothing party,
or known more directly as the

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:40.686
Nativist Party--more on that in
a moment--is really challenging

00:07:40.686 --> 00:07:42.730
that two-party system.

00:07:46.029 --> 00:07:48.536
But it was that vote in the
House that I showed you on a

00:07:48.536 --> 00:07:50.769
graphic the other day that tells
you the story.

00:07:50.769 --> 00:07:54.600
It passed the House of
Representatives 113 to 110,

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:59.925
in a highly sectionalized vote.
Ninety percent of all

00:07:59.925 --> 00:08:06.069
Southerners, on Kansas-Nebraska,
voted for it;

00:08:06.069 --> 00:08:09.730
sixty four percent of all
Northerners, people from Free

00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:13.782
states, voted against it.
The second American party

00:08:13.782 --> 00:08:18.939
system, born out of the struggle
over Jacksonian--so-called

00:08:18.939 --> 00:08:23.740
Jacksonian democracy--from the
1820s into the '30s,

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:27.065
into the '40s,
into the early '50s,

00:08:27.065 --> 00:08:32.053
was now disintegrating,
faster than most people even

00:08:32.053 --> 00:08:34.010
really realized.

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:40.919
The effects of this were
quickly this:

00:08:40.919 --> 00:08:46.033
the Kansas-Nebraska Act now
threw open the vast expanse of

00:08:46.033 --> 00:08:50.877
what was left of the Louisiana
Purchase to the possible

00:08:50.877 --> 00:08:55.708
expansion of slavery.
Secondly, it will destroy the

00:08:55.708 --> 00:08:59.363
Whig Party forever,
and open a huge vacuum in

00:08:59.363 --> 00:09:04.429
American political culture for
some kind of new coalition,

00:09:04.429 --> 00:09:08.787
some kind of new persuasion
that would fill it,

00:09:08.787 --> 00:09:13.903
about this great question of
its time--the expansion of

00:09:13.903 --> 00:09:16.455
slavery.
And then more directly,

00:09:16.455 --> 00:09:19.778
third, it brought overnight the
birth of the Republican

00:09:19.778 --> 00:09:22.240
Party--the original Republican
Party,

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:27.424
I hasten to add--a party formed
literally overnight in reaction

00:09:27.424 --> 00:09:31.614
to the Kansas-Nebraska Act.
It was often first called the

00:09:31.614 --> 00:09:34.529
Anti-Kansas Party.
There are three or four towns

00:09:34.529 --> 00:09:37.441
all over the Midwest in the
United States--Ripon,

00:09:37.441 --> 00:09:39.249
Wisconsin;
Jackson, Michigan,

00:09:39.249 --> 00:09:42.647
and others--that all claim to
be the site of the birth of the

00:09:42.647 --> 00:09:45.386
Republican Party.
And they all have their little

00:09:45.386 --> 00:09:48.491
monuments or their plaques in
town squares and parks to say

00:09:48.491 --> 00:09:51.650
they were the place where the
first Republican Party meeting

00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:54.529
was held.
But the Republican Party was

00:09:54.529 --> 00:09:58.940
really born amidst hundreds of
meetings across the North,

00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:03.779
to discuss the Kansas-Nebraska
Act, to react to it,

00:10:03.779 --> 00:10:08.620
to figure out some way to
politically resist it.

00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:11.407
That "hell of a storm:
that Stephen Douglas had

00:10:11.407 --> 00:10:13.710
predicted, is exactly what
happened,

00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:21.251
but he didn't have any clue the
direction or the ferocity of the

00:10:21.251 --> 00:10:26.039
political storm that this would
cause.

00:10:26.039 --> 00:10:30.475
To so many Northerners now,
who believed--for whom the

00:10:30.475 --> 00:10:33.990
American dream was mobility in
the West,

00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:37.211
availability of cheap if not
free land in the West,

00:10:37.211 --> 00:10:39.659
the possibility of the small
farmer,

00:10:39.659 --> 00:10:44.514
the small mechanic,
moving west and getting land in

00:10:44.514 --> 00:10:50.242
a society without slaves--now
seemed to be completely thrown

00:10:50.242 --> 00:10:53.830
up in the air,
if not denied.

00:10:56.850 --> 00:10:59.541
I don't know what to really
compare it to today,

00:10:59.541 --> 00:11:03.908
that might shock people.
Something you assumed was just

00:11:03.908 --> 00:11:09.569
going to be there and tomorrow
it's not--it's just gone--and

00:11:09.569 --> 00:11:15.230
you basically defined the future
of your children on it.

00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:19.349
Lots of people now wondered
what happened to the Compromise

00:11:19.349 --> 00:11:23.455
of 1850.
Well that was essentially a

00:11:23.455 --> 00:11:26.780
dead letter.
And what was born in that

00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:30.027
Republican Party,
what was born in those meetings

00:11:30.027 --> 00:11:34.018
that formed the Republican Party
in the summer of 1854 was a

00:11:34.018 --> 00:11:38.613
theory,
an idea they called "the slave

00:11:38.613 --> 00:11:43.172
power conspiracy."
It actually wasn't born there,

00:11:43.172 --> 00:11:46.560
that's an old idea,
the idea of a slave power.

00:12:00.139 --> 00:12:04.115
But the idea of a slave power,
this notion of some kind of

00:12:04.115 --> 00:12:06.637
conspiracy, a cadre,
an oligarchy,

00:12:06.637 --> 00:12:10.737
a small number of great
planters in the Deep South that

00:12:10.737 --> 00:12:14.989
nevertheless had tremendously
disproportionate power over

00:12:14.989 --> 00:12:18.030
their own states,
over their own region,

00:12:18.030 --> 00:12:21.707
and then in the Congress and in
the Supreme Count and in the

00:12:21.707 --> 00:12:24.679
Presidency,
was an old idea.

00:12:24.679 --> 00:12:27.185
I've found it as early as the
1820s in an old,

00:12:27.185 --> 00:12:30.414
old article I once wrote where
people were actually already

00:12:30.414 --> 00:12:32.529
using the term,
"the slave power."

00:12:32.529 --> 00:12:38.019
But it really crystallized in
the 1850s.

00:12:38.019 --> 00:12:41.282
This is a poster,
one of hundreds,

00:12:41.282 --> 00:12:46.720
thousands of posters from 1854
calling for a meeting.

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:48.742
It doesn't even use the term
Republican Party anywhere,

00:12:48.742 --> 00:12:50.539
just calling people
together--it's in Chester,

00:12:50.539 --> 00:12:53.236
Pennsylvania I think--just
calling people together to

00:12:53.236 --> 00:12:57.710
discuss the Kansas-Nebraska Act,
to discuss what's really

00:12:57.710 --> 00:13:03.019
happened here,
and to discuss the slave power.

00:13:03.019 --> 00:13:05.156
Classic nineteenth century
broadside with eight things

00:13:05.156 --> 00:13:06.809
going on at once in front of
your eyes,

00:13:06.809 --> 00:13:14.638
but the boldest print is
reserved for the slave power:

00:13:14.638 --> 00:13:19.660
fear, conspiracy,
come together,

00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:22.230
watch out, get ready.

00:13:28.039 --> 00:13:30.453
The fear now,
you see--think closely about

00:13:30.453 --> 00:13:33.220
this--to Northerners was,
"now wait a second,

00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:36.259
if what the Kansas-Nebraska Act
is saying is that the

00:13:36.259 --> 00:13:39.767
Louisiana--all the rest of the
Louisiana Purchase is now open

00:13:39.767 --> 00:13:43.157
to the possible expansion of
slavery--it's got to be rooted

00:13:43.157 --> 00:13:46.548
in a constitutional theory that
probably is supporting that

00:13:46.548 --> 00:13:49.529
Fifth Amendment which is the
right to life,

00:13:49.529 --> 00:13:52.782
liberty, and property,
and the transport of that

00:13:52.782 --> 00:13:57.861
property anywhere you want.
So what's to stop someday,

00:13:57.861 --> 00:14:03.530
somehow, slave holders from
coming into Illinois,

00:14:03.530 --> 00:14:06.720
Ohio, New York,
Boston?"

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:09.626
It might seem a bit
far-fetched, but editorials

00:14:09.626 --> 00:14:12.090
started appearing all over the
North,

00:14:12.090 --> 00:14:15.200
like this one from The New
York Post that predicted,

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:18.951
quote, "Gangs of men and women,
chained together may yet be

00:14:18.951 --> 00:14:22.842
seen now marching up or down
Broadway, or trembling in

00:14:22.842 --> 00:14:24.090
Battery Park."

00:14:27.769 --> 00:14:31.633
What was born in that summer,
and especially that fall,

00:14:31.633 --> 00:14:35.996
was the most rapid third-party
political coalition movement in

00:14:35.996 --> 00:14:39.892
all of American history;
and if you want a prototype for

00:14:39.892 --> 00:14:43.555
any possibility of that kind,
any other time in our political

00:14:43.555 --> 00:14:44.960
history, this is it.

00:14:49.009 --> 00:14:53.371
The Republican Party,
brand new--not six months

00:14:53.371 --> 00:14:59.060
old--will elect 100 people to
the House of Representatives in

00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:05.154
the fall elections of 1854,
and they will begin to draw

00:15:05.154 --> 00:15:10.937
together a remarkable coalition.
They're going to draw first a

00:15:10.937 --> 00:15:14.393
whole lot of old Whigs,
Northern Whigs in particular,

00:15:14.393 --> 00:15:16.720
who don't have any home
anymore.

00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:20.099
This is the old Whig Party of
Henry Clay, but it's also the

00:15:20.099 --> 00:15:23.129
old Whig Party that had a
reformist element to it.

00:15:23.129 --> 00:15:30.059
This was the old John Quincy
Adams wing of the Whig Party.

00:15:30.059 --> 00:15:32.659
And there were some Whigs who
had become genuine

00:15:32.659 --> 00:15:34.430
abolitionists,
in many states,

00:15:38.039 --> 00:15:40.716
and they now were looking for a
real political home in which to

00:15:40.716 --> 00:15:42.529
plant their flag--of not just
free soil,

00:15:42.529 --> 00:15:45.550
but a moral case against
slavery.

00:15:45.550 --> 00:15:49.899
You got the old Free Soilers.
The Free Soil Party had existed

00:15:49.899 --> 00:15:52.539
in 1848 and in the 1852
elections--remember,

00:15:52.539 --> 00:15:54.054
I told you they elected,
what was it,

00:15:54.054 --> 00:15:55.990
four people to the House of
Representatives.

00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:03.168
But more importantly,
that Republican Party now had

00:16:03.168 --> 00:16:06.269
tremendous--we're calling it now
"crossover,"

00:16:06.269 --> 00:16:10.511
aren't we--tremendous crossover
appeal to Northern Democrats,

00:16:10.511 --> 00:16:14.611
lifelong Northern Democrats who
will now break with Stephen

00:16:14.611 --> 00:16:18.872
Douglas,
break with popular sovereignty,

00:16:18.872 --> 00:16:25.588
break with their own political
lives, and join a new free-soil

00:16:25.588 --> 00:16:28.487
anti-slavery party.
David Wilmot,

00:16:28.487 --> 00:16:30.509
the author of the Wilmot
Proviso, you'll remember from a

00:16:30.509 --> 00:16:32.607
week ago,
that Pennsylvania Democrat who

00:16:32.607 --> 00:16:35.921
launched this idea during the
debates on the Mexican War that

00:16:35.921 --> 00:16:39.014
said in any state formed from a
territory gained from the

00:16:39.014 --> 00:16:41.390
Mexican War slavery shall never
exist,

00:16:41.390 --> 00:16:46.054
the basic free soil position.
In 1854, David Wilmot became a

00:16:46.054 --> 00:16:47.260
Republican.

00:16:51.019 --> 00:16:53.265
This new political coalition,
fledging as it was--a lot of

00:16:53.265 --> 00:16:56.498
strange bedfellows here,
guys who had just fought like

00:16:56.498 --> 00:17:01.220
hell with each other for years
in the Congress were now kind of

00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:05.923
forming the same party.
They're forming it around a few

00:17:05.923 --> 00:17:09.466
key ideas.
One is this notion,

00:17:09.466 --> 00:17:17.059
this idea of a slave power that
has to be resisted now.

00:17:17.059 --> 00:17:21.776
As a political force it has to
be resisted, as an expansionist

00:17:21.776 --> 00:17:26.261
migration force it has to be
resisted, as a labor system it

00:17:26.261 --> 00:17:28.924
has to be resisted.
And secondly,

00:17:28.924 --> 00:17:32.597
they are rooting their
political future and ideology in

00:17:32.597 --> 00:17:36.074
what they're calling,
quite explicitly now--and

00:17:36.074 --> 00:17:40.057
they've rehearsed this,
many of them for some years--an

00:17:40.057 --> 00:17:43.819
anti-slavery interpretation of
the Constitution.

00:17:43.819 --> 00:17:48.170
They're going to now really
rehearse publicly the idea that

00:17:48.170 --> 00:17:52.295
"yes, slavery may be protected
constitutionally where it

00:17:52.295 --> 00:17:55.626
already exists,
because slaves are legally

00:17:55.626 --> 00:17:57.512
property.
Okay, we've heard that for

00:17:57.512 --> 00:18:00.930
decades," they're going to say.
But the Federal Government has

00:18:00.930 --> 00:18:04.799
jurisdiction over territories,
it has jurisdiction over the

00:18:04.799 --> 00:18:08.832
District of Columbia,
and the slogan that flows from

00:18:08.832 --> 00:18:12.804
this idea of an anti-slavery
interpretation of the

00:18:12.804 --> 00:18:16.210
Constitution is "make freedom
national,

00:18:16.210 --> 00:18:17.730
slavery sectional."

00:18:23.049 --> 00:18:25.469
That slavery shall forever be,
they say, a regional,

00:18:25.469 --> 00:18:28.961
sectional, local institution,
not a national institution,

00:18:28.961 --> 00:18:33.229
which was an implicit way of
saying the West shall be kept

00:18:33.229 --> 00:18:35.850
free for free labor at all cost.

00:18:39.369 --> 00:18:41.787
And then thirdly,
the Republican party is

00:18:41.787 --> 00:18:45.595
rooted--and this is why it could
become a coalition--it's rooted

00:18:45.595 --> 00:18:49.101
in this cluster of ideas we've
come to call here--and Bruce

00:18:49.101 --> 00:18:52.910
Levine's book is terrific on
this--a free labor ideology.

00:18:56.470 --> 00:19:03.974
A fear of concentrated power,
the defense of the individual,

00:19:03.974 --> 00:19:07.809
the small man.
It was a fanfare for the common

00:19:07.809 --> 00:19:11.292
man, the small farmer or the
small clerk, the small--small in

00:19:11.292 --> 00:19:14.240
the sense of--he has nothing,
he may own nothing,

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:18.586
but he wants to own something.
It's the immigrant with nothing

00:19:18.586 --> 00:19:21.980
who wants to own a farm,
and he must have,

00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:26.119
at least in this America of its
boundless West,

00:19:26.119 --> 00:19:32.890
he must have physical mobility,
geographical mobility.

00:19:32.890 --> 00:19:37.552
And historians have come to
define all of this,

00:19:37.552 --> 00:19:42.315
of course, under this cluster
of notions we call

00:19:42.315 --> 00:19:46.443
Republicanism,
the belief that the United

00:19:46.443 --> 00:19:51.140
States was, if not a democracy,
at least a Republic,

00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:56.017
where the people rule,
where consent of a majority

00:19:56.017 --> 00:19:57.610
really counts.

00:20:02.009 --> 00:20:04.604
And if that majority is
increasingly becoming small

00:20:04.604 --> 00:20:06.420
farmers and clerks and
mechanics,

00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:10.033
and a lot of them immigrants,
then oligarchies ought to be

00:20:10.033 --> 00:20:12.822
put on the run,
whether those oligarchies are

00:20:12.822 --> 00:20:16.690
bankers or those oligarchies are
made up of slaveholders.

00:20:22.079 --> 00:20:27.124
This was in its birth,
and for the next six years,

00:20:27.124 --> 00:20:32.478
one of the most potent
political coalition ideologies

00:20:32.478 --> 00:20:40.039
this country has ever seen.
Now, what happens next?

00:20:40.039 --> 00:20:43.890
What happens to this new
coalition?

00:20:43.890 --> 00:20:48.079
And why are they going to be so
threatening to the South?

00:20:48.079 --> 00:20:52.416
This in some ways is going to
become the planter elite,

00:20:52.416 --> 00:20:56.109
Southern slaveholding class's
greatest fear,

00:20:56.109 --> 00:21:00.687
a genuine Yankee,
anti-slavery Northern political

00:21:00.687 --> 00:21:01.450
party.

00:21:05.009 --> 00:21:07.878
After all, the North now has
close to, pushing,

00:21:07.878 --> 00:21:10.309
a two to one advantage in
population;

00:21:10.309 --> 00:21:14.471
that is if we simply define
that by Free states,

00:21:14.471 --> 00:21:29.456
Slave states.
Now, maybe you've seen this

00:21:29.456 --> 00:21:40.189
picture before.
It's a lithograph of the famous

00:21:40.189 --> 00:21:44.191
beating of Charles Sumner in the
spring of 1856,

00:21:44.191 --> 00:21:48.789
on the floor of the U.S.
Senate, by Preston Brooks.

00:21:48.789 --> 00:21:52.149
Now, how do we get to a scene
in the U.S.

00:21:52.149 --> 00:21:56.516
Senate of a Southern
Congressman beating the hell out

00:21:56.516 --> 00:22:00.703
of a Massachusetts Senator,
beating him literally

00:22:00.703 --> 00:22:04.850
unconscious, bloodying him on
the floor of the Senate,

00:22:08.009 --> 00:22:09.680
while his fellow senators look
down, and some of them in glee?

00:22:13.359 --> 00:22:17.309
There were ninety-one Northern
Democrats in the House of

00:22:17.309 --> 00:22:21.690
Representatives when they voted
on the Kansas-Nebraska Act.

00:22:21.690 --> 00:22:25.435
After the fall elections of
1854 there were only twenty-five

00:22:25.435 --> 00:22:25.880
left.

00:22:29.019 --> 00:22:31.828
This is a political sea change
happening and no one quite knows

00:22:31.828 --> 00:22:35.498
where it's going yet.
And in that same year of 1854,

00:22:35.498 --> 00:22:40.318
this Nativist Party--they
called themselves the American

00:22:40.318 --> 00:22:45.138
Party--a party that stood
essentially for trying to stop

00:22:45.138 --> 00:22:49.169
Catholic--mainly
Catholic--immigration into the

00:22:49.169 --> 00:22:52.349
United States.
This was the moment of

00:22:52.349 --> 00:22:55.757
course--I mean look around
today, we've got a huge debate

00:22:55.757 --> 00:22:59.592
going on about immigration and I
won't go into that--but you can

00:22:59.592 --> 00:23:02.514
see how it's clustering in parts
of our political

00:23:02.514 --> 00:23:06.410
culture--heighten that six times
over to the early 1850s.

00:23:06.410 --> 00:23:10.686
The huge Irish migrations to
the United States had just

00:23:10.686 --> 00:23:15.200
happened between the mid-1840s,
especially the late-1840s,

00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:18.856
and about 1852 to '54.
This is the moment,

00:23:18.856 --> 00:23:22.050
the historical moment,
of the terrible,

00:23:22.050 --> 00:23:25.160
infamous potato famine in
Ireland.

00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:27.469
The Nativist Party was
anti-Catholic,

00:23:27.469 --> 00:23:31.078
anti-immigrant.
They believed that Catholicism

00:23:31.078 --> 00:23:35.191
would undermine American
Protestant values and the

00:23:35.191 --> 00:23:39.292
Protestant work ethic.
They believed that a United

00:23:39.292 --> 00:23:43.000
States of America ought to be a
white, Anglo-Saxon,

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:46.559
Protestant nation,
as it was in its founding.

00:23:46.559 --> 00:23:51.160
They believed in a conspiracy
of Popery;

00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:54.720
crazy as that may seem to some
of us today.

00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:58.989
They believed that Catholics
owed and demonstrated a higher

00:23:58.989 --> 00:24:03.480
loyalty to the Pope in Rome than
they ever would in the United

00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:05.271
States,
to the United States

00:24:05.271 --> 00:24:07.823
Government, and therefore
Catholics could not be true

00:24:07.823 --> 00:24:08.560
Republicans.

00:24:12.059 --> 00:24:14.498
I know, give me a break,
but it is what this party was

00:24:14.498 --> 00:24:15.050
rooted in.

00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:22.541
And man did they succeed.
They won huge electoral

00:24:22.541 --> 00:24:26.606
victories in the fall of 1854,
particularly because there's

00:24:26.606 --> 00:24:29.830
this new vacuum now,
the Whig Party's dead.

00:24:34.029 --> 00:24:37.933
By 1856, in the Presidential
election of '56,

00:24:37.933 --> 00:24:43.080
the Nativist American Party
candidate will win over 800,000

00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:47.960
votes for the presidency--more
on that in a second.

00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:51.447
The American Party won forty
seats in the U.S.

00:24:51.447 --> 00:24:54.660
Congress in 1854.
They dominated a few northern

00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:57.489
state legislatures.
They won the governorship of

00:24:57.489 --> 00:25:00.340
Massachusetts and a majority of
its legislature.

00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:04.765
It shocked people.
It shocked some Northern

00:25:04.765 --> 00:25:08.309
Democrats who weren't
comfortable with this nativism,

00:25:08.309 --> 00:25:12.740
the virulence of this nativism,
to become Republicans instead.

00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:21.118
Now out west,
of course, what's going to

00:25:21.118 --> 00:25:26.375
happen to Kansas and Nebraska?
Kansas now became the object of

00:25:26.375 --> 00:25:31.267
tremendous migration.
It was nothing but a series of

00:25:31.267 --> 00:25:36.563
frontier settlements in 1855,
but large numbers of people

00:25:36.563 --> 00:25:40.886
began to go there.
These were the so-called

00:25:40.886 --> 00:25:44.815
squatters, squatter farmers.
But immediately,

00:25:44.815 --> 00:25:48.889
it became a contest between how
many Yankees and Northerners

00:25:48.889 --> 00:25:53.309
would actually get there and try
to make the place free soil,

00:25:53.309 --> 00:25:57.550
and how many Southerners would
actually get there,

00:25:57.550 --> 00:26:00.320
with slaves,
and try to produce a

00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:04.595
pro-slavery constitution.
Kansas became the great testing

00:26:04.595 --> 00:26:06.360
ground of popular sovereignty.

00:26:13.009 --> 00:26:15.327
Immigrant aid societies
emerged, especially in New

00:26:15.327 --> 00:26:17.159
England.
One famous one that had a lot

00:26:17.159 --> 00:26:20.066
of financial backing behind it,
called the New England Emigrant

00:26:20.066 --> 00:26:22.372
Aid Society,
they recruited settlers,

00:26:22.372 --> 00:26:25.512
they raised money,
they paid people's way out to

00:26:25.512 --> 00:26:28.579
Kansas,
in some cases.

00:26:28.579 --> 00:26:31.580
Kansas now became a kind of
symbol and reality.

00:26:35.009 --> 00:26:37.336
Out on its border,
of course--its eastern border

00:26:37.336 --> 00:26:39.960
was the state of Missouri,
which was a Slave state,

00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:43.730
and Missourians began to flock
across the border into Kansas,

00:26:43.730 --> 00:26:44.610
taking land.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:50.640
By March of 1855,
only one year,

00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:53.128
less than a year,
11 months after the passage of

00:26:53.128 --> 00:26:57.480
the Kansas-Nebraska Act,
they held their first election

00:26:57.480 --> 00:27:03.029
for a territorial legislature in
the Territory of Kansas.

00:27:03.029 --> 00:27:08.990
An estimated 5,000 so-called
border ruffians--or that meant

00:27:08.990 --> 00:27:15.670
Missourians--flocked over into
Kansas for a day or two to vote.

00:27:15.670 --> 00:27:21.615
The census--they took a rapid
census in the early spring of

00:27:21.615 --> 00:27:27.252
1855 in Kansas--recorded 2,905
eligible voters in all of

00:27:27.252 --> 00:27:32.526
Kansas.
In that territorial legislation

00:27:32.526 --> 00:27:39.014
election, 6,307 people voted;
way more than half of the

00:27:39.014 --> 00:27:45.470
people registered to vote voted.
Something was wrong.

00:27:45.470 --> 00:27:49.417
They elected a pro-slavery
legislature, adopted a

00:27:49.417 --> 00:27:52.460
pro-slavery constitution
overnight.

00:27:52.460 --> 00:27:59.369
And Free Soilers cried foul,
formed their own attempt at a

00:27:59.369 --> 00:28:04.734
government that summer.
And by January of 1856,

00:28:04.734 --> 00:28:10.420
the beginning of the next year,
in a sense, in essence,

00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:14.002
there were two fledgling
territorial governments in

00:28:14.002 --> 00:28:16.940
Kansas, one free soil,
one pro-slavery.

00:28:21.019 --> 00:28:24.572
And it was then--that spring of
1856--that what we call Bleeding

00:28:24.572 --> 00:28:28.994
Kansas, this border frontier,
civil war, this village against

00:28:28.994 --> 00:28:32.790
village, river ravine against
river ravine,

00:28:32.790 --> 00:28:39.063
broke out.
Before it played out over about

00:28:39.063 --> 00:28:42.905
a year and a half about 250
people would be killed--many of

00:28:42.905 --> 00:28:46.813
them in nighttime raids and
vigilante violence--and millions

00:28:46.813 --> 00:28:47.940
in treasure.

00:28:51.190 --> 00:28:57.569
I will come back to John Brown
later, next week in fact.

00:28:57.569 --> 00:29:01.970
Our friend John Brown from
upstate New York--or somebody's

00:29:01.970 --> 00:29:06.447
friend, he wasn't easy to be
friends with--had already sent

00:29:06.447 --> 00:29:10.693
out some of his sons--more on
that later--and John Brown

00:29:10.693 --> 00:29:14.089
arrived himself in the winter of
1856.

00:29:14.089 --> 00:29:18.572
John Brown, a genuine,
radical, deeply religious Old

00:29:18.572 --> 00:29:22.440
Testament abolitionist who went
to Kansas,

00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:26.688
make no mistake,
to make Kansas free and to kill

00:29:26.688 --> 00:29:30.934
slaveholders if necessary,
in what he believed was a

00:29:30.934 --> 00:29:32.100
justifiable war.

00:29:36.019 --> 00:29:39.460
That spring,
John Brown with his band of men

00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:44.180
was traveling along the road
when he got news of the beating

00:29:44.180 --> 00:29:49.321
of Charles Sumner in the Senate.
What happened in the Senate is

00:29:49.321 --> 00:29:52.638
that Charles Sumner,
the radical abolitionist

00:29:52.638 --> 00:29:56.601
Senator from Massachusetts,
one of only a tiny

00:29:56.601 --> 00:30:00.570
handful--actually one of only
two or three,

00:30:00.570 --> 00:30:05.390
three or four--real card
carrying abolitionists,

00:30:05.390 --> 00:30:09.984
if we want to call them that,
who had seats in the U.S.

00:30:09.984 --> 00:30:13.109
Senate.
Sumner, deeply well-educated,

00:30:13.109 --> 00:30:15.795
classically educated,
Harvard man,

00:30:15.795 --> 00:30:20.433
began his political life as a
so-called Conscience Whig in

00:30:20.433 --> 00:30:23.868
Massachusetts.
He got elected to the U.S.

00:30:23.868 --> 00:30:28.082
Senate in the fervor over the
Mexican War and in the fervor

00:30:28.082 --> 00:30:33.049
over the expansion of slavery.
In his first few years in the

00:30:33.049 --> 00:30:35.885
Senate, from 1849,
'50, '51, '52,

00:30:35.885 --> 00:30:40.509
they had a virtual gag on him.
Any time Sumner tried to get

00:30:40.509 --> 00:30:44.092
the floor--this went on for
about four years--there were all

00:30:44.092 --> 00:30:47.977
kinds of parliamentary maneuvers
that the opposition could use to

00:30:47.977 --> 00:30:51.979
prevent him from speaking.
They didn't want abolitionist

00:30:51.979 --> 00:30:54.319
rhetoric in the halls of the
U.S.

00:30:54.319 --> 00:30:57.458
Senate.
But with time he got a

00:30:57.458 --> 00:31:02.604
position, that is,
a place where he could speak,

00:31:02.604 --> 00:31:05.670
in the Senate's calendar.

00:31:10.009 --> 00:31:13.748
And he did, he delivered a
speech early that spring called

00:31:13.748 --> 00:31:18.050
"The Crime Against Kansas."
He delivered it in March 1856.

00:31:18.050 --> 00:31:22.281
It took him about six hours.
It was later published in a

00:31:22.281 --> 00:31:24.790
pamphlet form.
It's about 35,40 pages.

00:31:29.009 --> 00:31:33.845
It was the classic free soil
argument of what was now the

00:31:33.845 --> 00:31:37.212
Republican Party,
and Sumner was by now,

00:31:37.212 --> 00:31:41.157
of course, a Republican.
He made all the arguments about

00:31:41.157 --> 00:31:44.164
a slave power conspiracy and an
anti-slavery interpretation of

00:31:44.164 --> 00:31:48.269
the Constitution.
He argued deeply into the

00:31:48.269 --> 00:31:54.009
cluster of ideas we call free
labor ideology.

00:31:54.009 --> 00:31:56.354
But then he laced the speech,
over and over,

00:31:56.354 --> 00:31:59.407
with personal attacks on
Southerners, personal attacks on

00:31:59.407 --> 00:32:02.894
Southern slave holders.
He singled out especially

00:32:02.894 --> 00:32:07.728
Senator Andrew Butler of South
Carolina, and he used Butler's

00:32:07.728 --> 00:32:12.803
alleged fathering of children by
a slave woman as representative

00:32:12.803 --> 00:32:17.960
of what Sumner said was a common
practice across the south.

00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:21.937
You could not imagine laying a
bigger taboo on your fellow

00:32:21.937 --> 00:32:26.509
Southern senators than this one.
He described Butler as,

00:32:26.509 --> 00:32:31.576
"a Don Quixote who had taken
the harlot slavery as his

00:32:31.576 --> 00:32:36.707
mistress."
And then he went on and on with

00:32:36.707 --> 00:32:40.319
that.
He was jeered.

00:32:40.319 --> 00:32:43.923
Southerners started shouting at
him and Sumner just enjoyed it

00:32:43.923 --> 00:32:46.950
and went on;
many of them walked out.

00:32:46.950 --> 00:32:49.559
But he had already had copies
of the speech printed.

00:32:49.559 --> 00:32:55.789
He had copies of the speech on
the street within a few days.

00:32:55.789 --> 00:32:59.359
In the audience that day,
sitting up in the balcony,

00:32:59.359 --> 00:33:03.140
was a member of the U.S.
House of Representatives named

00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:07.059
Preston Brooks who was the
nephew of Senator Butler.

00:33:07.059 --> 00:33:13.039
About a week after this event,
it may have been two weeks,

00:33:13.039 --> 00:33:18.180
Butler decided that he was
going to have honor,

00:33:18.180 --> 00:33:23.999
he was going to exercise an act
of honor and revenge deeply

00:33:23.999 --> 00:33:30.220
rooted in what he believed was
the Old South sense of honor.

00:33:30.220 --> 00:33:32.727
He had thought about
challenging Sumner to a duel,

00:33:32.727 --> 00:33:35.490
but duels by this point in time
were highly illegal,

00:33:35.490 --> 00:33:39.539
even though people did get
challenged--read my colleague

00:33:39.539 --> 00:33:42.896
Joanne Freeman on this.
They're still challenging each

00:33:42.896 --> 00:33:45.020
other to duels all the time in
the 1850s;

00:33:45.020 --> 00:33:48.583
well, a lot of times.
But he decided against

00:33:48.583 --> 00:33:52.255
challenging Sumner to a duel.
Instead, he thought he would

00:33:52.255 --> 00:33:56.234
take a sort of Plan B--he would
meet Sumner at his desk with a

00:33:56.234 --> 00:33:58.060
cane and try to kill him.

00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:06.769
And he did.
Brooks took a cane to

00:34:06.769 --> 00:34:08.715
Sumner--Sumner was sitting at
his desk, literally signing

00:34:08.715 --> 00:34:10.869
copies of "The Crime Against
Kansas" speech to be sent out.

00:34:10.869 --> 00:34:13.139
And he got trapped in the desk,
we're told;

00:34:13.139 --> 00:34:16.600
he couldn't get out of it and
Brooks just kept banging on his

00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:18.918
head, over and over,
just bloodied him into

00:34:18.918 --> 00:34:21.159
unconsciousness,
and Sumner fell on the floor.

00:34:21.159 --> 00:34:23.369
And there are all kinds of
stories--and in fact this

00:34:23.369 --> 00:34:26.234
lithograph tries to capture it,
although I'm not sure you can

00:34:26.234 --> 00:34:29.449
see it very well--there are all
kinds of stories about Senators,

00:34:29.449 --> 00:34:33.057
especially Southerners,
gathering around and saying,

00:34:33.057 --> 00:34:35.250
"Hold me back,
hold me back,"

00:34:35.250 --> 00:34:37.500
as they smiled and watched
Sumner bleed on the floor.

00:34:41.010 --> 00:34:43.814
And finally somebody grabbed
Brook's cane and said,

00:34:43.814 --> 00:34:45.890
"You know, that's probably
enough."

00:34:48.969 --> 00:34:50.949
[Laughter]
I mean, by any definition this

00:34:50.949 --> 00:34:53.869
was an assault with a deadly
weapon, this was an assault and

00:34:53.869 --> 00:34:55.699
battery, it was attempted
murder.

00:34:55.699 --> 00:34:59.607
Preston Brooks went back to the
House of Representatives,

00:34:59.607 --> 00:35:03.585
tendered his resignation and
said he would go back home to

00:35:03.585 --> 00:35:07.283
South Carolina and submit
himself to the people of his

00:35:07.283 --> 00:35:10.340
district.
And he did.

00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:13.530
And they overwhelmingly
re-elected him.

00:35:13.530 --> 00:35:19.899
He also received more than one
hundred commemorative canes in

00:35:19.899 --> 00:35:26.162
the mail, some of which you can
see today at the Caroliniana

00:35:26.162 --> 00:35:30.320
Library in Columbia,
South Carolina.

00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:33.334
This became,
of course, a cause

00:35:33.334 --> 00:35:38.660
célèbre,
a brutal example now of the way

00:35:38.660 --> 00:35:42.780
in which compromise was being
ruined,

00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:48.340
middle realm for moderation,
was perhaps being destroyed.

00:35:48.340 --> 00:35:51.079
Violence had broken out all
over Kansas;

00:35:51.079 --> 00:35:55.834
violence had now broken out in
the U.S.

00:35:55.834 --> 00:35:59.160
Senate.
It led many people to a fearful

00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:04.488
set of expressions;
there are literally hundreds of

00:36:04.488 --> 00:36:09.208
these in the press.
This is one from William Cullen

00:36:09.208 --> 00:36:12.895
Bryant who wrote in The New
York Evening Post,

00:36:12.895 --> 00:36:16.369
after the news broke of the
beating of Sumner;

00:36:16.369 --> 00:36:18.723
I quote him:
"A violence reigns in the

00:36:18.723 --> 00:36:21.755
streets of Washington.
Violence has now found its way

00:36:21.755 --> 00:36:24.890
into the Senate Chamber.
Violence lies in wait all over

00:36:24.890 --> 00:36:28.902
the navigable rivers and all the
railways of Missouri to obstruct

00:36:28.902 --> 00:36:32.099
those who pass from the Free
states into Kansas.

00:36:32.099 --> 00:36:35.151
Violence overhangs the
frontiers of that territory like

00:36:35.151 --> 00:36:37.920
a storm cloud charged with hail
and lightening.

00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:41.206
Violence has carried election
after election in that

00:36:41.206 --> 00:36:44.178
territory.
In short, violence is the order

00:36:44.178 --> 00:36:47.004
of the day.
The North is to be pushed to

00:36:47.004 --> 00:36:50.106
the wall by it,
and this plot will succeed if

00:36:50.106 --> 00:36:53.773
the people of the Free states
are as apathetic as the

00:36:53.773 --> 00:36:56.030
slaveholders are insolent."

00:37:00.099 --> 00:37:05.295
It was news of the beating of
Sumner on the floor of the

00:37:05.295 --> 00:37:11.151
Senate that apparently made John
Brown snap and within 48 hours

00:37:11.151 --> 00:37:16.062
he led what's called the
Pottawattamie Creek Massacre

00:37:16.062 --> 00:37:20.880
where he murdered five
pro-slavery advocates,

00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:23.353
in cold blood,
with broad swords,

00:37:23.353 --> 00:37:28.800
in the dark of the night.
We will return to John Brown's

00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:32.909
exploits next week.
Now, that year was though a

00:37:32.909 --> 00:37:36.787
presidential election year,
and the problem is still just

00:37:36.787 --> 00:37:39.349
laying there out on the
landscape.

00:37:39.349 --> 00:37:46.019
What is to happen with
Kansas-Nebraska?

00:37:46.019 --> 00:37:48.110
What's to be done with Bleeding
Kansas?

00:37:48.110 --> 00:37:49.790
What's to be done with--?

00:37:58.889 --> 00:38:03.282
Now in that election of
1856--this is terribly important

00:38:03.282 --> 00:38:08.154
just to note for a moment--the
Republican Party will mount its

00:38:08.154 --> 00:38:16.010
first effort at the presidency.
And it all but won.

00:38:16.010 --> 00:38:18.553
This had never happened in
American history till then,

00:38:18.553 --> 00:38:21.192
it's never happened since,
a new third party had come so

00:38:21.192 --> 00:38:24.495
close to winning.
The platform of the Republican

00:38:24.495 --> 00:38:26.791
Party in 1856 was,
if anything,

00:38:26.791 --> 00:38:31.229
slightly more radical than it
had been two years earlier in

00:38:31.229 --> 00:38:34.519
those congressional elections of
1854.

00:38:34.519 --> 00:38:39.480
They took a staunch stand about
slavery expansion.

00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:46.119
They took a staunch stand on
keeping Kansas free.

00:38:46.119 --> 00:38:49.918
They announced,
directly, that they would,

00:38:49.918 --> 00:38:54.735
quote, "destroy slavery
wherever Federal jurisdiction

00:38:54.735 --> 00:38:55.940
reigned."

00:38:59.329 --> 00:39:03.806
For President they ran John C.
Fremont, a young,

00:39:03.806 --> 00:39:06.949
dashing, romantic,
heroic type.

00:39:06.949 --> 00:39:09.493
He had been one of the great
surveyors and explorers of the

00:39:09.493 --> 00:39:12.550
West.
He was already known by the

00:39:12.550 --> 00:39:18.559
nickname "the Pathfinder," and
he was the first Senator from

00:39:18.559 --> 00:39:23.049
the state of California.
He's also the son-in-law of

00:39:23.049 --> 00:39:25.561
Thomas Hart Benton,
a very powerful--now

00:39:25.561 --> 00:39:28.799
Republican--from Missouri.
He was well married,

00:39:28.799 --> 00:39:31.060
well connected and
good-looking.

00:39:35.010 --> 00:39:38.934
They centered their
campaign--they borrowed Sumner's

00:39:38.934 --> 00:39:43.321
own language--and they centered
their campaign on what the

00:39:43.321 --> 00:39:47.322
Republican Party itself now
called "the crime against

00:39:47.322 --> 00:39:51.348
Kansas."
They were also for tariffs,

00:39:51.348 --> 00:39:57.354
for the transcontinental
railroad across the West and so

00:39:57.354 --> 00:39:59.124
on.
The American Party,

00:39:59.124 --> 00:40:02.349
known as the Know-Nothings,
by the way, because in their

00:40:02.349 --> 00:40:05.868
origins--if you didn't know this
about the Know-Nothings-- in

00:40:05.868 --> 00:40:09.270
their origins the American
Nativist Party tried to maintain

00:40:09.270 --> 00:40:12.730
a secrecy--they were kind of a
secret society at first-- and

00:40:12.730 --> 00:40:17.070
when asked who they were and how
they met and what they were for,

00:40:17.070 --> 00:40:20.360
the original members would
always say they knew nothing.

00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:23.962
So anytime you hear that term,
Know-nNthingism,

00:40:23.962 --> 00:40:27.799
in American politics,
if somebody throws--if Chris

00:40:27.799 --> 00:40:31.010
Matthews throws that term off at
you,

00:40:31.010 --> 00:40:35.196
showing of his political
history knowledge--it usually

00:40:35.196 --> 00:40:38.751
means nativism,
or it means some kind of third

00:40:38.751 --> 00:40:42.251
party phenomenon.
The Know-Nothings nominated

00:40:42.251 --> 00:40:45.389
that year Millard Fillmore,
former president;

00:40:45.389 --> 00:40:47.760
he'd been the President during
the Compromise of 1850.

00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:51.591
It was a very strange choice.
And the Know-Nothings were now

00:40:51.591 --> 00:40:54.671
in some trouble because of this
powerful new Republican

00:40:54.671 --> 00:40:58.094
coalition which is managing now
to draw some of the Nativists

00:40:58.094 --> 00:41:00.777
into them,
because it turns out some

00:41:00.777 --> 00:41:04.725
Nativists were actually more
afraid of the slaveholding

00:41:04.725 --> 00:41:08.820
oligarchy than they were of this
Catholic conspiracy.

00:41:08.820 --> 00:41:13.290
If they had to choose
conspiracies they were a little

00:41:13.290 --> 00:41:17.159
more frightened of slaveholders
than Popes.

00:41:17.159 --> 00:41:22.791
The Democrats went safe,
they chose a largely

00:41:22.791 --> 00:41:29.190
incompetent James Buchanan to
run for President.

00:41:29.190 --> 00:41:32.980
He was from Pennsylvania--kind
of lower north.

00:41:32.980 --> 00:41:36.202
He was known to have very
strong ties to the South and to

00:41:36.202 --> 00:41:39.309
be what Republicans are already
calling a doughface,

00:41:39.309 --> 00:41:43.059
which meant a Northerner with
Southern sympathies.

00:41:43.059 --> 00:41:46.045
And he had been the United
States Ambassador to Britain

00:41:46.045 --> 00:41:49.252
during the Kansas-Nebraska
crisis, so he had never voted on

00:41:49.252 --> 00:41:53.130
it;
he had no position to defend.

00:41:53.130 --> 00:41:58.030
It was a highly sectionalized
election.

00:41:58.030 --> 00:42:02.274
Buchanan carried every Slave
state except Maryland,

00:42:02.274 --> 00:42:06.009
and then he carried New Jersey,
Pennsylvania,

00:42:06.009 --> 00:42:09.150
Indiana, Illinois and
California.

00:42:09.150 --> 00:42:13.639
The Democratic Party was still
a national party.

00:42:13.639 --> 00:42:18.639
Fremont, the Republican,
carried the rest of the Free

00:42:18.639 --> 00:42:22.100
states and New England
decisively.

00:42:25.860 --> 00:42:29.838
Fremont and Fillmore
together--and Fillmore,

00:42:29.838 --> 00:42:33.910
the Nativist candidate,
got 850,000 votes;

00:42:33.910 --> 00:42:41.191
Buchanan about 1.8 million;
Fremont about 1.5,1.6

00:42:41.191 --> 00:42:48.680
million--no, 1.3 million.
If the Nativist Party had not

00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:51.942
been in this election and if
most of the Nativists had gone

00:42:51.942 --> 00:42:54.479
to Fremont,
the Republican,

00:42:54.479 --> 00:43:00.427
or even two-thirds of them,
Fremont would've won the

00:43:00.427 --> 00:43:05.463
presidency.
This anti-slavery northern

00:43:05.463 --> 00:43:12.010
coalition of free soil advocates
came very close.

00:43:12.010 --> 00:43:14.731
They would even call it,
in its wake,

00:43:14.731 --> 00:43:18.813
a victory within defeat,
for such a brand new political

00:43:18.813 --> 00:43:21.645
party.
Now, out in Kansas they're

00:43:21.645 --> 00:43:24.200
still trying to hold elections;

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:28.991
one corrupt,
fraudulent election after

00:43:28.991 --> 00:43:31.670
another.
Buchanan took office in the

00:43:31.670 --> 00:43:34.746
spring of '57.
He appointed a new governor for

00:43:34.746 --> 00:43:36.873
the Territory of Kansas named
Robert J.

00:43:36.873 --> 00:43:40.233
Walker whose job it was going
to--he was a solid Pennsylvania

00:43:40.233 --> 00:43:43.458
Democrat but nevertheless said,
"I will go out and there and

00:43:43.458 --> 00:43:46.708
enforce popular sovereignty.
We're going to have a true,

00:43:46.708 --> 00:43:49.383
free ballot in Kansas.
Popular sovereignty is still

00:43:49.383 --> 00:43:49.940
going to work."

00:43:54.630 --> 00:43:58.527
The trouble was,
popular sovereignty was now

00:43:58.527 --> 00:44:02.040
dead in the water.
It was tainted, at best.

00:44:05.139 --> 00:44:09.088
In the election of delegates to
yet another attempt at a state

00:44:09.088 --> 00:44:12.583
constitutional writing
convention in Kansas in the fall

00:44:12.583 --> 00:44:16.067
of 1857,
the Free Soilers boycotted the

00:44:16.067 --> 00:44:18.350
election.
So at Lecompton,

00:44:18.350 --> 00:44:23.096
Kansas--and hence the term the
Lecompton Constitution--a

00:44:23.096 --> 00:44:26.980
pro-slavery constitutional
convention met,

00:44:26.980 --> 00:44:30.952
with the Free Soilers all
boycotting, and they drafted--no

00:44:30.952 --> 00:44:33.599
mistake--a pro-slavery
constitution.

00:44:33.599 --> 00:44:38.119
It protected slavery and the
right to slave ownership

00:44:38.119 --> 00:44:42.030
eternally, forever,
in the state of Kansas.

00:44:42.030 --> 00:44:46.994
It excluded from residence in
the state of Kansas any free

00:44:46.994 --> 00:44:51.262
negroes, and it said that it
could not be amended,

00:44:51.262 --> 00:44:54.050
in any way, for seven years.

00:44:58.420 --> 00:45:01.298
This process had taken drastic
liberties with the idea of

00:45:01.298 --> 00:45:04.143
popular sovereignty,
which as you'll remember was

00:45:04.143 --> 00:45:07.875
the idea you're supposed to have
a popular referendum and just

00:45:07.875 --> 00:45:11.179
let the vote determine whether
slavery shall exist.

00:45:11.179 --> 00:45:16.918
This Governor Walker lost
control of the territory,

00:45:16.918 --> 00:45:21.510
violence continued--terrible
violence.

00:45:21.510 --> 00:45:24.722
And Walker came back to
Washington, urged his own

00:45:24.722 --> 00:45:28.202
president, who had appointed
him, to not support this

00:45:28.202 --> 00:45:31.499
Lecompton Constitution.
He said it's just--it's not

00:45:31.499 --> 00:45:35.081
right, it's just too fraudulent.
It was boycotted by half of the

00:45:35.081 --> 00:45:38.603
people, probably more than half
the people, and Buchanan made a

00:45:38.603 --> 00:45:42.010
fateful decision.
He said, "Nope.

00:45:42.010 --> 00:45:44.167
They've had their popular
sovereignty, they've had their

00:45:44.167 --> 00:45:45.579
constitutional writing
convention.

00:45:45.579 --> 00:45:48.559
If the Free Soilers chose not
to participate that's the way it

00:45:48.559 --> 00:45:52.130
goes."
And Buchanan took the Lecompton

00:45:52.130 --> 00:45:57.362
Constitution to Congress and
asked for its approval,

00:45:57.362 --> 00:46:02.557
of Kansas as a Slave state.
Buchanan took huge political

00:46:02.557 --> 00:46:07.094
risks here and didn't--for all
practical purposes--apparently

00:46:07.094 --> 00:46:11.204
know what he was doing.
And here we begin to see now

00:46:11.204 --> 00:46:15.570
the breakup, the tearing apart,
now of even the Democratic

00:46:15.570 --> 00:46:18.172
Party,
because none other than Stephen

00:46:18.172 --> 00:46:21.380
Douglas, father of popular
sovereignty, author of the

00:46:21.380 --> 00:46:26.038
Kansas-Nebraska Act,
the man who had pushed that act

00:46:26.038 --> 00:46:30.739
through, went to Buchanan and
said, "No sir,

00:46:30.739 --> 00:46:33.636
you cannot support the
Lecompton Constitution,

00:46:33.636 --> 00:46:37.495
it's a fraudulent constitution.
The majority of the people in

00:46:37.495 --> 00:46:39.830
that territory are probably free
soil.

00:46:39.830 --> 00:46:44.113
You can't do this."
He broke with his own

00:46:44.113 --> 00:46:49.988
President, and it would be
disastrous for the Democratic

00:46:49.988 --> 00:46:52.875
Party.
The Lecompton Constitution was

00:46:52.875 --> 00:46:54.800
not accepted by the Congress.

00:46:59.059 --> 00:47:04.681
Now, the Dred Scott decision,
which came down that same

00:47:04.681 --> 00:47:10.302
spring of 1857 in the immediate
aftermath of Buchanan's

00:47:10.302 --> 00:47:15.408
election--there's old Dred,
not a great picture of him,

00:47:15.408 --> 00:47:19.513
but it's the only photograph we
have of Dred Scott--the Dred

00:47:19.513 --> 00:47:23.756
Scott decision also came down in
the midst of a major American

00:47:23.756 --> 00:47:27.869
depression.
The so-called Panic of 1857

00:47:27.869 --> 00:47:32.654
broke out that very spring.
The same time as Buchanan is

00:47:32.654 --> 00:47:35.465
being inaugurated,
the Lecompton Constitution is

00:47:35.465 --> 00:47:38.907
being forged out in Kansas,
the Dred Scott decision is

00:47:38.907 --> 00:47:42.139
going to be announced,
the country is falling into a

00:47:42.139 --> 00:47:45.500
horrible economic panic.
There are many causes of it.

00:47:45.500 --> 00:47:46.590
I wish I had the time.

00:47:52.639 --> 00:47:58.040
Actually, I'm going to save the
Panic of 1857 because it sets up

00:47:58.040 --> 00:48:02.070
Lincoln and Douglas in '58,
'59 for me later.

00:48:02.070 --> 00:48:06.844
But I want to leave you--I've
got three minutes I think,

00:48:06.844 --> 00:48:10.403
two minutes,
two, three--with this fateful

00:48:10.403 --> 00:48:13.865
Supreme Court Case;
many people like to say the

00:48:13.865 --> 00:48:16.851
worst Supreme Court decision in
all of American history,

00:48:16.851 --> 00:48:19.619
but I suspect you can get up a
debate over that.

00:48:19.619 --> 00:48:21.090
I think we've had a couple of
others;

00:48:21.090 --> 00:48:27.250
I won't name them.
Who was Dred Scott?

00:48:27.250 --> 00:48:31.260
This man, who was an old man by
the time the Supreme Court ruled

00:48:31.260 --> 00:48:34.889
on him and put his name forever
into American history as a

00:48:34.889 --> 00:48:38.494
symbol,
was born a slave in 1795 in

00:48:38.494 --> 00:48:39.570
Virginia.

00:48:42.820 --> 00:48:47.437
He had moved to Missouri in the
1820s with his master,

00:48:47.437 --> 00:48:51.880
a man--his original master's
name was Peter Blow.

00:48:51.880 --> 00:48:57.108
He was then later owned by a
physician, a doctor named John

00:48:57.108 --> 00:49:00.690
Emerson.
Emerson was an Army surgeon,

00:49:00.690 --> 00:49:05.667
and Emerson traveled from
Missouri all over the upper

00:49:05.667 --> 00:49:11.122
Midwest and into what then was
the Great Plains as an Army

00:49:11.122 --> 00:49:15.429
surgeon working at Army camps
and bases.

00:49:15.429 --> 00:49:19.780
Dred Scott went with him as his
personal servant.

00:49:19.780 --> 00:49:22.659
They traveled to Illinois and
Minnesota.

00:49:22.659 --> 00:49:27.835
Dred Scott lived with his
master from 1834 to 1838,

00:49:27.835 --> 00:49:32.802
four years, with Dr.
Emerson, on various kinds of

00:49:32.802 --> 00:49:36.839
military bases,
especially in Minnesota,

00:49:36.839 --> 00:49:40.088
a free territory.
At one point,

00:49:40.088 --> 00:49:44.233
Dred Scott tried to buy his own
freedom in Minnesota and wasn't

00:49:44.233 --> 00:49:47.657
allowed to do it.
He married a free black woman

00:49:47.657 --> 00:49:50.610
named Harriet while he was in
Minnesota.

00:49:50.610 --> 00:49:55.810
Four years residence on free
soil, an attempt to buy his own

00:49:55.810 --> 00:49:59.159
freedom, marries a free black
woman.

00:49:59.159 --> 00:50:03.816
Emerson brought him back to
Missouri in 1838 and through an

00:50:03.816 --> 00:50:08.793
intricate series of events for
the next five to six years-- not

00:50:08.793 --> 00:50:13.610
the least of which was Missouri
is a very divided place,

00:50:13.610 --> 00:50:17.954
especially St.
Louis--a group of anti-slavery

00:50:17.954 --> 00:50:23.880
folk gathered around Dred Scott
and tried to help him sue for

00:50:23.880 --> 00:50:27.573
his freedom.
In 1846, they moved his case

00:50:27.573 --> 00:50:31.424
through local courts,
and the first decision--was at

00:50:31.424 --> 00:50:36.029
a local court--because of his
residence and free soil for four

00:50:36.029 --> 00:50:40.610
years,
gave Dred Scott his freedom.

00:50:40.610 --> 00:50:44.940
That court decided the case in
1850.

00:50:44.940 --> 00:50:48.667
It was then appealed by the
State of Missouri,

00:50:48.667 --> 00:50:52.230
which was really worried about
this case,

00:50:52.230 --> 00:50:56.741
to the Missouri Supreme Court,
and the Missouri Supreme Court,

00:50:56.741 --> 00:51:03.139
by a decision of two to one,
ruled no, no, no.

00:51:03.139 --> 00:51:07.676
On appeal, Dred Scott's freedom
would be denied--that he did not

00:51:07.676 --> 00:51:11.781
have the right to his freedom
because of residence on free

00:51:11.781 --> 00:51:14.811
soil.
Then, again with the help of an

00:51:14.811 --> 00:51:18.038
anti-slavery group,
and even his own owner,

00:51:18.038 --> 00:51:21.726
believe it or not,
they pushed this appeal to the

00:51:21.726 --> 00:51:23.570
U.S.
Supreme Court.

00:51:23.570 --> 00:51:25.141
Dr.
Emerson was gone,

00:51:25.141 --> 00:51:28.756
Dred was now owned by a man
named John Sanford,

00:51:28.756 --> 00:51:33.000
and hence the case is called
Sanford versus Scott.

00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:35.170
Scott's case came before the
U.S.

00:51:35.170 --> 00:51:38.900
Supreme Court as early as 1854
and got on the docket.

00:51:38.900 --> 00:51:42.219
It would not be decided for
2½ years.

00:51:42.219 --> 00:51:44.840
Most people didn't even know
this was happening.

00:51:44.840 --> 00:51:49.088
I'll leave you here.
Only three days after James

00:51:49.088 --> 00:51:52.844
Buchanan was inaugurated
President, having just only

00:51:52.844 --> 00:51:56.599
narrowly defeated this new
Republican coalition,

00:51:56.599 --> 00:52:01.570
news broke in Washington of
something called the Dred Scott

00:52:01.570 --> 00:52:06.711
decision, and it would electrify
the political culture of the

00:52:06.711 --> 00:52:10.117
country.
It will fuel this Republican

00:52:10.117 --> 00:52:15.467
Party anti-slavery coalition as
much as--in some places--as much

00:52:15.467 --> 00:52:18.780
as the Kansas Nebraska act ever
had,

00:52:18.780 --> 00:52:25.440
and it will inspire Abraham
Lincoln to run for the senate.

00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:26.706
That's it for now.

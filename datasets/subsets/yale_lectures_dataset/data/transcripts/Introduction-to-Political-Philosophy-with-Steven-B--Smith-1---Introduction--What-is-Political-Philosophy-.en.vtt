00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:05.391
Professor Steven Smith:
Let me start today by asking the

00:00:05.391 --> 00:00:08.430
question, "what is political
philosophy?"

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:13.508
Custom dictates that I say
something about the subject

00:00:13.508 --> 00:00:17.150
matter of this course at its
outset.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.974
This in some ways might seem a
case of putting the cart before

00:00:21.974 --> 00:00:25.850
the horse, or the cart before
the course maybe,

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:30.994
because how can you say,
how can we say what political

00:00:30.994 --> 00:00:34.780
philosophy is in advance of
doing it?

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:40.850
Anyway, let me try to say
something that might be useful.

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.903
In one sense,
you could say political

00:00:43.903 --> 00:00:49.161
philosophy is simply a branch or
what we call a subfield of the

00:00:49.161 --> 00:00:53.910
field of political science.
Yes, all right.

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.063
It exists alongside of other
areas of political inquiry like

00:00:59.063 --> 00:01:02.644
American government,
comparative politics,

00:01:02.644 --> 00:01:06.997
and international relations.
Yet in another sense,

00:01:06.997 --> 00:01:10.852
political philosophy is
something much different than

00:01:10.852 --> 00:01:15.242
simply a subfield;
it seems to be the oldest and

00:01:15.242 --> 00:01:19.540
most fundamental part of
political science.

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:24.075
Its purpose is to lay bare,
as it were, the fundamental

00:01:24.075 --> 00:01:28.611
problems, the fundamental
concepts and categories which

00:01:28.611 --> 00:01:33.473
frame the study of politics.
In this respect it seems to me

00:01:33.473 --> 00:01:37.604
much less like just a branch of
political science than the

00:01:37.604 --> 00:01:40.430
foundation of the entire
discipline.

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:48.616
The study of political
philosophy often begins as this

00:01:48.616 --> 00:01:52.950
course will do also,
with the study of the great

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.560
books or some of the great books
of our field.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.144
Political philosophy is the
oldest of the social sciences,

00:02:02.144 --> 00:02:06.647
and it can boast a wealth of
heavy hitters from Plato and

00:02:06.647 --> 00:02:10.377
Aristotle to Machiavelli,
Hobbes, Hegel,

00:02:10.377 --> 00:02:13.870
Tocqueville,
Nietzsche, and so on.

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.093
You might say that the best way
to learn what political

00:02:18.093 --> 00:02:21.612
philosophy is,
is simply to study and read the

00:02:21.612 --> 00:02:25.131
works of those who have shaped
the field--yes,

00:02:25.131 --> 00:02:27.829
right?
But to do that is,

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:30.958
I recognize,
not without dangers,

00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:34.379
often severe dangers of its
own.

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:40.250
Why study just these thinkers
and not others?

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:45.953
Is not any so-called list of
great thinkers or great texts

00:02:45.953 --> 00:02:52.057
likely to be simply arbitrary
and tell us more about what such

00:02:52.057 --> 00:02:56.259
a list excludes than what it
includes?

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:58.761
Furthermore,
it would seem that the study of

00:02:58.761 --> 00:03:01.961
the great books or great
thinkers of the past can easily

00:03:01.961 --> 00:03:04.580
degenerate into a kind of
antiquarianism,

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:09.599
into a sort of pedantry.
We find ourselves easily

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:15.646
intimidated by a list of famous
names and end up not thinking

00:03:15.646 --> 00:03:18.481
for ourselves.
Furthermore,

00:03:18.481 --> 00:03:23.339
doesn't the study of old books,
often very old books,

00:03:23.339 --> 00:03:27.729
risk overlooking the issues
facing us today?

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:32.670
What can Aristotle or Hobbes
tells us about the world of

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.096
globalization,
of terrorism,

00:03:35.096 --> 00:03:38.330
of ethnic conflict and the
like?

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:43.099
Doesn't political science make
any progress?

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:49.039
After all, economists no longer
read Adam Smith.

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:52.961
I hesitate to...
I don't hesitate to say

00:03:52.961 --> 00:03:57.820
that you will never read Adam
Smith in an economics course

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:01.384
here at Yale,
and it is very unlikely that

00:04:01.384 --> 00:04:05.009
you will read Freud in your
psychology classes.

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:09.193
So why then does political
science, apparently uniquely

00:04:09.193 --> 00:04:13.376
among the social sciences,
continue to study Aristotle,

00:04:13.376 --> 00:04:15.700
Locke and other old books?

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:25.091
These are all real questions,
and I raise them now myself

00:04:25.091 --> 00:04:30.172
because they are questions I
want you to be thinking about as

00:04:30.172 --> 00:04:34.660
you do your reading and work
through this course.

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.700
I want you to remain alive to
them throughout the semester.

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:41.470
Yes?
Okay.

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:45.534
One reason I want to suggest
that we continue to read these

00:04:45.534 --> 00:04:49.670
books is not because political
science makes no progress,

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:54.354
or that we are somehow uniquely
fixated on an ancient past,

00:04:54.354 --> 00:04:59.441
but because these works provide
us with the most basic questions

00:04:59.441 --> 00:05:02.430
that continue to guide our
field.

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:07.036
We continue to ask the same
questions that were asked by

00:05:07.036 --> 00:05:10.470
Plato, Machiavelli,
Hobbes, and others.

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:15.740
We may not accept their answers
and it's very likely that we do

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:20.160
not, but their questions are
often put with a kind of

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:25.110
unrivaled clarity and insight.
The fact is that there are

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:28.121
still people in the world,
many people,

00:05:28.121 --> 00:05:31.449
who regard themselves as
Aristotelians,

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:36.656
Thomists, Lockeans,
Kantians, even the occasional

00:05:36.656 --> 00:05:42.730
Marxist can still be found in
Ivy League universities.

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:45.779
These doctrines have not simply
been refuted,

00:05:45.779 --> 00:05:48.690
or replaced,
or historically superceded;

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:52.934
they remain in many ways
constitutive of our most basis

00:05:52.934 --> 00:05:59.041
outlooks and attitudes.
They are very much alive with

00:05:59.041 --> 00:06:04.254
us today, right.
So political philosophy is not

00:06:04.254 --> 00:06:09.544
just some kind of strange
historical appendage attached to

00:06:09.544 --> 00:06:15.798
the trunk of political science;
it is constitutive of its

00:06:15.798 --> 00:06:20.649
deepest problems.
If you doubt the importance of

00:06:20.649 --> 00:06:26.149
the study of political ideas for
politics, consider the works of

00:06:26.149 --> 00:06:29.589
a famous economist,
John Maynard Keynes,

00:06:29.589 --> 00:06:34.690
everyone's heard of him.
Keynes wrote in 1935.

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:37.230
"The ideas of economists and
political philosophers,

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:39.769
both when they are right and
when they are wrong,

00:06:39.769 --> 00:06:44.747
are more powerful than is
commonly understood....Practical

00:06:44.747 --> 00:06:48.637
men," Keynes continues,
practical men "who believe

00:06:48.637 --> 00:06:51.920
themselves to be quite exempt
from any intellectual

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:55.492
influences,
are usually the slave of some

00:06:55.492 --> 00:06:59.262
defunct economist.
Madmen in authority,

00:06:59.262 --> 00:07:04.751
who hear voices in the air,
are distilling their frenzy

00:07:04.751 --> 00:07:10.240
from some academic scribbler of
a few years back" .

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:16.973
So this course will be devoted
to the study of those "academic

00:07:16.973 --> 00:07:23.375
scribblers" who have written
books that continue to impress

00:07:23.375 --> 00:07:28.894
and create the forms of
authority with which we are

00:07:28.894 --> 00:07:32.564
familiar.
But one thing we should not do,

00:07:32.564 --> 00:07:36.595
right, one thing we should not
do is to approach these works as

00:07:36.595 --> 00:07:38.874
if they provide,
somehow, answers,

00:07:38.874 --> 00:07:41.639
ready-made answers to the
problems of today.

00:07:41.639 --> 00:07:45.279
Only we can provide answers to
our problems.

00:07:45.279 --> 00:07:49.760
Rather, the great works provide
us, so to speak,

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:53.954
with a repository of
fundamental or permanent

00:07:53.954 --> 00:07:58.910
questions that political
scientists still continue to

00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:03.835
rely on in their work.
The great thinkers are great

00:08:03.835 --> 00:08:08.992
not because they've created some
set of museum pieces that can be

00:08:08.992 --> 00:08:12.021
catalogued,
admired, and then safely

00:08:12.021 --> 00:08:15.823
ignored like a kind of
antiquities gallery in the

00:08:15.823 --> 00:08:20.042
Metropolitan Museum of Art;
but rather because they have

00:08:20.042 --> 00:08:24.057
defined the problems that all
later thinkers and scholars have

00:08:24.057 --> 00:08:27.939
had to use in order to make
sense of their world at all.

00:08:27.939 --> 00:08:33.386
Again, we still think in terms
of the basic concepts and

00:08:33.386 --> 00:08:38.040
categories that were created for
us long ago.

00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:38.600
Okay?

00:08:42.909 --> 00:08:49.072
So one thing you will quickly
note is that there are no

00:08:49.072 --> 00:08:55.350
permanent answers in a study of
political philosophy.

00:08:55.350 --> 00:09:01.517
A famous mathematician once
said, "Every question must have

00:09:01.517 --> 00:09:06.940
a correct answer,
for every question one answer."

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:12.799
That itself is an eminently
contestable proposition.

00:09:12.799 --> 00:09:17.213
Among the great thinkers there
is profound disagreement over

00:09:17.213 --> 00:09:21.702
the answers to even the most
fundamental questions concerning

00:09:21.702 --> 00:09:24.693
justice,
concerning rights,

00:09:24.693 --> 00:09:29.182
concerning liberty.
In political philosophy,

00:09:29.182 --> 00:09:34.406
it is never a sufficient answer
to answer a question with a

00:09:34.406 --> 00:09:37.740
statement "because Plato says
so,"

00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:43.771
or "because Nietzsche says so."
There are no final authorities

00:09:43.771 --> 00:09:47.590
in that respect in philosophy
because even the greatest

00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:51.480
thinkers disagree profoundly
with one another over their

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:54.277
answers,
and it is precisely this

00:09:54.277 --> 00:09:59.049
disagreement with one another
that makes it possible for us,

00:09:59.049 --> 00:10:02.899
the readers today,
to enter into their

00:10:02.899 --> 00:10:07.671
conversation.
We are called upon first to

00:10:07.671 --> 00:10:12.430
read and listen,
and then to judge "who's

00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:15.590
right?"
"how do we know?"

00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:20.983
The only way to decide is not
to defer to authority,

00:10:20.983 --> 00:10:26.164
whoever's authority,
but to rely on our own powers

00:10:26.164 --> 00:10:31.204
of reason and judgment,
in other words the freedom of

00:10:31.204 --> 00:10:35.800
the human mind to determine for
us what seems right or best.

00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:40.840
Okay?

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:46.720
But what are these problems
that I'm referring to?

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:51.912
What are these problems that
constitute the subject matter of

00:10:51.912 --> 00:10:56.334
the study of politics?
What are the questions that

00:10:56.334 --> 00:10:59.460
political scientists try to
answer?

00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:04.769
Such a list may be long,
but not infinitely so.

00:11:04.769 --> 00:11:10.340
Among the oldest and still most
fundamental questions are:

00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:15.600
what is justice?
What are the goals of a decent

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:19.312
society?
How should a citizen be

00:11:19.312 --> 00:11:23.698
educated?
Why should I obey the law,

00:11:23.698 --> 00:11:30.029
and what are the limits,
if any, to my obligation?

00:11:30.029 --> 00:11:33.660
What constitutes the ground of
human dignity?

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:36.450
Is it freedom?
Is it virtue?

00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:40.642
Is it love, is it friendship?
And of course,

00:11:40.642 --> 00:11:43.944
the all important question,
even though political

00:11:43.944 --> 00:11:48.139
philosophers and political
scientists rarely pronounce it,

00:11:48.139 --> 00:11:52.510
namely, quid sit deus,
what is God?

00:11:52.510 --> 00:11:56.955
Does he exist?
And what does that imply for

00:11:56.955 --> 00:12:01.500
our obligations as human beings
and citizens?

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:05.292
Those are some of the most
basic and fundamental problems

00:12:05.292 --> 00:12:08.204
of the study of politics,
but you might say,

00:12:08.204 --> 00:12:10.710
where does one enter this
debate?

00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:16.191
Which questions and which
thinkers should one pick up for

00:12:16.191 --> 00:12:19.253
oneself?
Perhaps the oldest and most

00:12:19.253 --> 00:12:24.190
fundamental question that I wish
to examine in the course of this

00:12:24.190 --> 00:12:27.740
semester is the question:
what is a regime?

00:12:30.810 --> 00:12:35.470
What are regimes?
What are regime politics?

00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:39.110
The term "regime" is a familiar
one.

00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:43.481
We often hear today about
shaping regimes or about

00:12:43.481 --> 00:12:47.140
changing regimes,
but what is a regime?

00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:52.360
How many kinds are there?
How are they defined?

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:55.435
What holds them together,
and what causes them to fall

00:12:55.435 --> 00:13:00.580
apart?
Is there a single best regime?

00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:04.019
Those are the questions I want
us to consider.

00:13:04.019 --> 00:13:07.738
The concept of the regime is
perhaps the oldest and most

00:13:07.738 --> 00:13:12.820
fundamental of political ideas.
It goes back to Plato and even

00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:15.591
before him.
In fact, the title of the book

00:13:15.591 --> 00:13:18.419
that you will be reading part of
for this semester,

00:13:18.419 --> 00:13:23.761
Plato's Republic,
is actually a translation of

00:13:23.761 --> 00:13:29.410
the Greek word politea
that means constitution or

00:13:29.410 --> 00:13:32.804
regime.
The Republic is a book

00:13:32.804 --> 00:13:37.647
about the regime and all later
political philosophy is a series

00:13:37.647 --> 00:13:41.646
of footnotes to Plato,
and that means that it must

00:13:41.646 --> 00:13:44.905
provide a series of variations,
so to speak,

00:13:44.905 --> 00:13:48.240
on Plato's conception of the
best regime.

00:13:51.510 --> 00:13:53.969
But what is a regime?
Broadly speaking,

00:13:53.969 --> 00:13:58.722
a regime indicates a form of
government, whether it is ruled

00:13:58.722 --> 00:14:01.553
by the one,
a few, the many,

00:14:01.553 --> 00:14:04.853
or as more common,
some mixture,

00:14:04.853 --> 00:14:09.750
a combination of these three
ruling powers.

00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:14.476
The regime is defined in the
first instance by how people are

00:14:14.476 --> 00:14:19.360
governed and how public offices
are distributed by election,

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:23.664
by birth, by lot,
by outstanding personal

00:14:23.664 --> 00:14:29.906
qualities and achievements,
and what constitutes a people's

00:14:29.906 --> 00:14:35.860
rights and responsibilities.
The regime again refers above

00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:40.535
all to a form of government.
The political world does not

00:14:40.535 --> 00:14:44.866
present itself as simply an
infinite variety of different

00:14:44.866 --> 00:14:48.549
shapes.
It is structured and ordered

00:14:48.549 --> 00:14:53.908
into a few basic regime types.
In this, I take it to be one of

00:14:53.908 --> 00:14:57.771
the most important propositions
and insights of political

00:14:57.771 --> 00:14:58.530
science.

00:15:02.910 --> 00:15:07.500
Right?
So far?

00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:12.149
But there is a corollary to
this insight.

00:15:12.149 --> 00:15:16.000
The regime is always something
particular.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:21.318
It stands in a relation of
opposition to other regime

00:15:21.318 --> 00:15:27.250
types, and as a consequence the
possibility of conflict,

00:15:27.250 --> 00:15:33.841
of tension, and war is built in
to the very structure of

00:15:33.841 --> 00:15:36.971
politics.
Regimes are necessarily

00:15:36.971 --> 00:15:41.539
partisan, that is to say they
instill certain loyalties and

00:15:41.539 --> 00:15:46.344
passions in the same way that
one may feel partisanship to the

00:15:46.344 --> 00:15:49.809
New York Yankees or the Boston
Red Sox,

00:15:49.809 --> 00:15:55.679
or to Yale over all rival
colleges and institutions,

00:15:55.679 --> 00:15:57.749
right?
Fierce loyalty,

00:15:57.749 --> 00:16:00.737
partisanship:
it is inseparable from the

00:16:00.737 --> 00:16:04.942
character of regime politics.
These passionate attachments

00:16:04.942 --> 00:16:08.259
are not merely something that
take place, you might,

00:16:08.259 --> 00:16:12.457
say between different regimes,
but even within them,

00:16:12.457 --> 00:16:17.479
as different parties and groups
with loyalties and attachments

00:16:17.479 --> 00:16:23.840
contend for power,
for honor, and for interest.

00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:28.708
Henry Adams once cynically
reflected that politics is

00:16:28.708 --> 00:16:32.360
simply the "organization of
hatreds,"

00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:36.382
and there is more than a grain
of truth to this,

00:16:36.382 --> 00:16:41.516
right, although he did not say
that it was also an attempt to

00:16:41.516 --> 00:16:46.394
channel and redirect those
hatreds and animosities towards

00:16:46.394 --> 00:16:51.486
something like a common good.
This raises the question

00:16:51.486 --> 00:16:55.329
whether it is possible to
transform politics,

00:16:55.329 --> 00:17:00.570
to replace enmity and factional
conflict with friendship,

00:17:00.570 --> 00:17:05.259
to replace conflict with
harmony?

00:17:05.259 --> 00:17:09.878
Today it is the hope of many
people, both here and abroad,

00:17:09.878 --> 00:17:14.885
that we might even overcome,
might even transcend the basic

00:17:14.885 --> 00:17:19.607
structure of regime politics
altogether and organize our

00:17:19.607 --> 00:17:24.930
world around global norms of
justice and international law.

00:17:24.930 --> 00:17:29.048
Is such a thing possible?
It can't be ruled out,

00:17:29.048 --> 00:17:32.334
but such a world,
I would note--let's just say a

00:17:32.334 --> 00:17:36.039
world administered by
international courts of law,

00:17:36.039 --> 00:17:41.354
by judges and judicial
tribunals--would no longer be a

00:17:41.354 --> 00:17:45.775
political world.
Politics only takes place

00:17:45.775 --> 00:17:49.750
within the context of the
particular.

00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:55.960
It is only possible within the
structure of the regime itself.

00:17:55.960 --> 00:18:01.515
But a regime is more than
simply a set of formal

00:18:01.515 --> 00:18:05.769
structures and institutions,
okay?

00:18:05.769 --> 00:18:11.166
It consists of the entire way
of life, the moral and religious

00:18:11.166 --> 00:18:15.589
practices, the habits,
customs, and sentiments that

00:18:15.589 --> 00:18:20.612
make a people what they are.
The regime constitutes an

00:18:20.612 --> 00:18:24.208
ethos,
that is to say a distinctive

00:18:24.208 --> 00:18:28.769
character, that nurtures
distinctive human types.

00:18:28.769 --> 00:18:33.397
Every regime shapes a common
character, a common character

00:18:33.397 --> 00:18:37.049
type with distinctive traits and
qualities.

00:18:37.049 --> 00:18:41.499
So the study of regime politics
is in part a study of the

00:18:41.499 --> 00:18:46.424
distinctive national character
types that constitutes a citizen

00:18:46.424 --> 00:18:49.051
body.
To take an example of what I

00:18:49.051 --> 00:18:52.875
mean, when Tocqueville studied
the American regime or the

00:18:52.875 --> 00:18:55.344
democratic regime,
properly speaking,

00:18:55.344 --> 00:18:58.561
in Democracy in America,
he started first with our

00:18:58.561 --> 00:19:02.410
formal political institutions as
enumerated in the Constitution,

00:19:02.410 --> 00:19:06.057
such things as the separation
of powers, the division between

00:19:06.057 --> 00:19:08.549
state and federal government and
so on,

00:19:08.549 --> 00:19:13.147
but then went on to look at
such informal practices as

00:19:13.147 --> 00:19:17.626
American manners and morals,
our tendency to form small

00:19:17.626 --> 00:19:20.801
civic associations,
our peculiar moralism and

00:19:20.801 --> 00:19:23.558
religious life,
our defensiveness about

00:19:23.558 --> 00:19:27.532
democracy and so on.
All of these intellectual and

00:19:27.532 --> 00:19:32.908
moral customs and habits helped
to constitute the democratic

00:19:32.908 --> 00:19:36.492
regime.
And this regime--in this sense

00:19:36.492 --> 00:19:41.569
the regime describes the
character or tone of a society.

00:19:41.569 --> 00:19:46.020
What a society finds most
praiseworthy,

00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:49.299
what it looks up to,
okay?

00:19:49.299 --> 00:19:54.087
You can't understand a regime
unless you understand,

00:19:54.087 --> 00:19:57.279
so to speak,
what it stands for,

00:19:57.279 --> 00:20:01.948
what a people stand for,
what they look up to as well as

00:20:01.948 --> 00:20:06.616
its, again, its structure of
institutions and rights and

00:20:06.616 --> 00:20:07.890
privileges.

00:20:12.859 --> 00:20:15.904
This raises a further set of
questions that we will consider

00:20:15.904 --> 00:20:19.551
over the term.
How are regimes founded,

00:20:19.551 --> 00:20:24.482
the founding of regimes?
What brings them into being and

00:20:24.482 --> 00:20:28.213
sustains them over time?
For thinkers like Tocqueville,

00:20:28.213 --> 00:20:30.973
for example,
regimes are embedded in the

00:20:30.973 --> 00:20:35.362
deep structures of human history
that have determined over long

00:20:35.362 --> 00:20:39.325
centuries the shape of our
political institutions and the

00:20:39.325 --> 00:20:43.596
way we think about them.
Yet other voices within the

00:20:43.596 --> 00:20:45.827
tradition--Plato,
Machiavelli,

00:20:45.827 --> 00:20:49.673
Rousseau come to mind--believed
that regimes can be

00:20:49.673 --> 00:20:53.981
self-consciously founded through
deliberate acts of great

00:20:53.981 --> 00:20:58.519
statesmen or founding fathers as
we might call them.

00:20:58.519 --> 00:21:03.225
These statesmen--Machiavelli
for example refers to Romulus,

00:21:03.225 --> 00:21:06.632
Moses, Cyrus,
as the founders that he looks

00:21:06.632 --> 00:21:09.294
to;
we might think of men like

00:21:09.294 --> 00:21:13.563
Washington, Jefferson,
Adams and the like--are shapers

00:21:13.563 --> 00:21:17.587
of peoples and institutions.
The very first of the

00:21:17.587 --> 00:21:21.734
Federalist Papers by
Alexander Hamilton even begins

00:21:21.734 --> 00:21:25.299
by posing this question in the
starkest terms.

00:21:25.299 --> 00:21:27.993
"It has been frequently
remarked," Hamilton writes,

00:21:27.993 --> 00:21:31.063
"that it seems to have been
reserved to the people of this

00:21:31.063 --> 00:21:33.789
country,
by their conduct and example,

00:21:33.789 --> 00:21:37.591
to decide the important
question, whether societies of

00:21:37.591 --> 00:21:41.894
men are really capable or not of
establishing good government

00:21:41.894 --> 00:21:46.209
from reflection and choice,
or whether they are forever

00:21:46.209 --> 00:21:50.249
destined to depend for their
political constitutions on

00:21:50.249 --> 00:21:53.965
accident and force."
There we see Hamilton asking

00:21:53.965 --> 00:21:57.457
the basic question about the
founding of political

00:21:57.457 --> 00:21:59.880
institutions:
are they created,

00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:02.818
as he puts it,
by "reflection and choice,"

00:22:02.818 --> 00:22:07.191
that is to say by a deliberate
act of statecraft and conscious

00:22:07.191 --> 00:22:11.228
human intelligence,
or are regimes always the

00:22:11.228 --> 00:22:14.382
product of accident,
circumstance,

00:22:14.382 --> 00:22:16.580
custom, and history?

00:22:20.339 --> 00:22:25.182
But the idea that regimes may
be created or founded by a set

00:22:25.182 --> 00:22:29.779
of deliberate acts raises a
further question that we will

00:22:29.779 --> 00:22:33.155
study,
and is inseparable from the

00:22:33.155 --> 00:22:37.640
study of regimes.
N'est pas?

00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:40.270
Who is a statesman?
What is a statesman?

00:22:43.710 --> 00:22:48.126
Again, one of the oldest
questions of political science,

00:22:48.126 --> 00:22:52.543
very rarely asked by the
political science of today that

00:22:52.543 --> 00:22:56.960
is very skeptical of the
language of statesmanship.

00:22:56.960 --> 00:23:01.189
In its oldest sense,
political science simply was a

00:23:01.189 --> 00:23:05.714
science of statecraft.
It was addressed to statesman

00:23:05.714 --> 00:23:11.220
or potential statesmen charged
with steering the ship of state.

00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:14.514
What are the qualities
necessary for sound

00:23:14.514 --> 00:23:18.349
statesmanship?
How does statecraft differ from

00:23:18.349 --> 00:23:22.617
other kinds of activities?
Must a good statesman,

00:23:22.617 --> 00:23:27.827
as Plato believed for example,
be a philosopher versed in

00:23:27.827 --> 00:23:31.549
poetry, mathematics,
and metaphysics?

00:23:31.549 --> 00:23:35.010
Or is statesmanship,
as Aristotle believed,

00:23:35.010 --> 00:23:39.213
a purely practical skill
requiring judgment based on

00:23:39.213 --> 00:23:41.850
deliberation and experience?

00:23:45.509 --> 00:23:51.756
Is a streak of cruelty and a
willingness to act immorally

00:23:51.756 --> 00:23:57.333
necessary for statecraft,
as Machiavelli infamously

00:23:57.333 --> 00:24:01.378
argued?
Must the statesman be capable

00:24:01.378 --> 00:24:07.500
of literally transforming human
nature, as Rousseau maintains,

00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:14.531
or is the sovereign a more or
less faceless bureaucrat in

00:24:14.531 --> 00:24:19.000
manner of a modern CEO,
as, for example,

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.660
someone like Hobbes seems to
have believed?

00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:24.945
All of our texts that we will
read--the Republic,

00:24:24.945 --> 00:24:27.230
the Politics,
the Prince,

00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:30.353
the Social
Contract--have different

00:24:30.353 --> 00:24:34.465
views on the qualities of
statecraft and what are those

00:24:34.465 --> 00:24:39.263
qualities necessary to found and
maintain states that we will be

00:24:39.263 --> 00:24:41.767
considering.
All of this,

00:24:41.767 --> 00:24:46.704
in a way, is another way of
saying, or at least implying,

00:24:46.704 --> 00:24:49.941
okay,
that political philosophy is an

00:24:49.941 --> 00:24:54.759
imminently practical
discipline, a practical field.

00:24:54.759 --> 00:24:58.735
Its purpose is not simply
contemplation,

00:24:58.735 --> 00:25:04.750
its purpose is not reflection
alone: it is advice giving.

00:25:04.750 --> 00:25:09.062
None of the people we will
study this semester were

00:25:09.062 --> 00:25:13.029
cloistered scholars detached
from the world,

00:25:13.029 --> 00:25:17.799
although this is a very common
prejudice against political

00:25:17.799 --> 00:25:22.653
philosophy, that it is somehow
uniquely sort of "pie in the

00:25:22.653 --> 00:25:25.750
sky" and detached from the
world.

00:25:25.750 --> 00:25:29.349
But the great thinkers were
very far from being just,

00:25:29.349 --> 00:25:31.980
so to speak,
detached intellectuals.

00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:39.681
Plato undertook three long and
dangerous voyages to Sicily in

00:25:39.681 --> 00:25:44.430
order to advise the King
Dionysius.

00:25:44.430 --> 00:25:49.140
Aristotle famously was a tutor
of Alexander the Great.

00:25:49.140 --> 00:25:53.601
Machiavelli spent a large part
of his career in the foreign

00:25:53.601 --> 00:25:58.293
service of his native Florence,
and wrote as an advisor to the

00:25:58.293 --> 00:26:01.941
Medici.
Hobbes was the tutor to a royal

00:26:01.941 --> 00:26:07.365
household who followed the King
into exile during the English

00:26:07.365 --> 00:26:11.195
Civil War.
And Locke was associated with

00:26:11.195 --> 00:26:16.415
the Shaftsbury Circle who also
was forced into exile after

00:26:16.415 --> 00:26:21.359
being accused of plotting
against the English King.

00:26:21.359 --> 00:26:24.736
Rousseau had no official
political connections,

00:26:24.736 --> 00:26:28.700
but he signed his name always
Jean Jacques Rousseau,

00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:32.586
"citizen of Geneva," and was
approached to write

00:26:32.586 --> 00:26:37.299
constitutions for Poland and for
the island of Corsica.

00:26:37.299 --> 00:26:41.666
And Tocqueville was a member of
the French National Assembly

00:26:41.666 --> 00:26:45.885
whose experience of American
democracy deeply affected the

00:26:45.885 --> 00:26:50.671
way he saw the future of Europe.
So the great political thinkers

00:26:50.671 --> 00:26:54.845
were typically engaged in the
politics of their times and help

00:26:54.845 --> 00:26:59.436
in that way to provide us,
okay, with models for how we

00:26:59.436 --> 00:27:01.670
might think about ours.

00:27:22.670 --> 00:27:25.759
But this goes in a slightly
different direction as well.

00:27:25.759 --> 00:27:28.990
Not only is this study of the
regime, as we've seen,

00:27:28.990 --> 00:27:32.765
as I've just tried to indicate,
rooted in, in many ways,

00:27:32.765 --> 00:27:37.119
the practical experience of the
thinkers we'll be looking at;

00:27:37.119 --> 00:27:42.222
but the study of regime
politics either implicitly or

00:27:42.222 --> 00:27:48.111
explicitly raises a question
that goes beyond the boundary of

00:27:48.111 --> 00:27:52.020
any given society.
A regime, as I've said,

00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:56.434
constitutes a people's way of
life, what they believe makes

00:27:56.434 --> 00:28:00.782
their life worth living,
or to put it again slightly

00:28:00.782 --> 00:28:04.009
differently, what a people stand
for.

00:28:04.009 --> 00:28:09.486
Although we are most familiar
with the character of a modern

00:28:09.486 --> 00:28:13.955
democratic regime such as ours,
the study of political

00:28:13.955 --> 00:28:17.660
philosophy is in many ways a
kind of immersion into what we

00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:20.279
might call today comparative
politics;

00:28:20.279 --> 00:28:24.302
that is to say it opens up to
us the variety of regimes,

00:28:24.302 --> 00:28:28.690
each with its own distinctive
set of claims or principles,

00:28:28.690 --> 00:28:34.436
each vying and potentially in
conflict with all the others,

00:28:34.436 --> 00:28:37.692
okay?
Underlying this cacophony of

00:28:37.692 --> 00:28:43.549
regimes is the question always,
which of these regimes is best?

00:28:43.549 --> 00:28:49.232
What has or ought to have a
claim on our loyalty and

00:28:49.232 --> 00:28:53.947
rational consent?
Political philosophy is always

00:28:53.947 --> 00:28:57.670
guided by the question of the
best regime.

00:28:57.670 --> 00:28:59.869
But what is the best
regime?

00:28:59.869 --> 00:29:04.926
Even to raise such a question
seems to pose insuperable

00:29:04.926 --> 00:29:08.209
obstacles.
Isn't that a completely

00:29:08.209 --> 00:29:12.621
subjective judgment,
what one thinks is the best

00:29:12.621 --> 00:29:17.412
regime?
How could one begin such a

00:29:17.412 --> 00:29:20.078
study?
Is the best regime,

00:29:20.078 --> 00:29:23.507
as the ancients tended to
believe, Plato,

00:29:23.507 --> 00:29:28.678
Aristotle, and others,
is it an aristocratic republic

00:29:28.678 --> 00:29:33.119
in which only the few best
habitually rule;

00:29:33.119 --> 00:29:36.942
or is the best regime as the
moderns believe,

00:29:36.942 --> 00:29:42.067
a democratic republic where in
principle political office is

00:29:42.067 --> 00:29:47.539
open to all by virtue of their
membership in society alone?

00:29:47.539 --> 00:29:52.917
Will the best regime be a small
closed society that through

00:29:52.917 --> 00:29:57.275
generations has made a supreme
sacrifice towards

00:29:57.275 --> 00:30:02.390
self-perfection?
Think of that.

00:30:02.390 --> 00:30:06.530
Or will the best regime be a
large cosmopolitan order

00:30:06.530 --> 00:30:10.599
embracing all human beings,
perhaps even a kind of

00:30:10.599 --> 00:30:15.319
universal League of Nations
consisting of all free and equal

00:30:15.319 --> 00:30:16.680
men and women?

00:30:19.799 --> 00:30:23.242
Whatever form the best regime
takes, however,

00:30:23.242 --> 00:30:27.623
it will always favor a certain
kind of human being with a

00:30:27.623 --> 00:30:32.795
certain set of character traits.
Is that type the common man,

00:30:32.795 --> 00:30:37.977
is it found in democracies;
those of acquired taste and

00:30:37.977 --> 00:30:42.509
money, as in aristocracies;
the warrior;

00:30:42.509 --> 00:30:46.630
or even the priest,
as in theocracies?

00:30:46.630 --> 00:30:50.378
No, no question that I can
think of can be more

00:30:50.378 --> 00:30:53.387
fundamental.
And this finally raises the

00:30:53.387 --> 00:30:57.468
question of the relation between
the best regime or the good

00:30:57.468 --> 00:30:59.786
regime,
and what we could say are

00:30:59.786 --> 00:31:02.974
actually existing regimes,
regimes that we are all

00:31:02.974 --> 00:31:06.018
familiar with.
What function does the best

00:31:06.018 --> 00:31:08.460
regime play in political
science?

00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:12.329
How does it guide our actions
here and now?

00:31:12.329 --> 00:31:16.785
This issue received a kind of
classic formulation in

00:31:16.785 --> 00:31:22.115
Aristotle's distinction of what
he called the good human being

00:31:22.115 --> 00:31:25.991
and the good citizen.
For the good citizen--we'll

00:31:25.991 --> 00:31:29.564
read this chapter later on in
the Politics--for the

00:31:29.564 --> 00:31:32.759
good citizen you could say
patriotism is enough,

00:31:32.759 --> 00:31:37.857
to uphold and defend the laws
of your own country simply

00:31:37.857 --> 00:31:42.769
because they are your own
is both necessary and

00:31:42.769 --> 00:31:46.415
sufficient.
Such a view of citizen virtue

00:31:46.415 --> 00:31:51.005
runs into the obvious objection
that the good citizen of one

00:31:51.005 --> 00:31:55.284
regime will be at odds with the
good citizen of another:

00:31:55.284 --> 00:32:00.107
a good citizen of contemporary
Iran will not be the same as the

00:32:00.107 --> 00:32:03.529
good citizen of contemporary
America.

00:32:03.529 --> 00:32:07.282
But the good citizen,
Aristotle goes on to say,

00:32:07.282 --> 00:32:11.279
is not the same as the good
human being, right?

00:32:11.279 --> 00:32:15.001
Where the good citizen is
relative to the regime,

00:32:15.001 --> 00:32:18.956
you might say regime-specific,
the good human being,

00:32:18.956 --> 00:32:21.980
so he believes,
is good everywhere.

00:32:21.980 --> 00:32:26.028
The good human being loves what
is good simply,

00:32:26.028 --> 00:32:31.220
not because it is his own,
but because it is good.

00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:36.615
Some sense of this was
demonstrated in Abraham

00:32:36.615 --> 00:32:42.851
Lincoln's judgment about Henry
Clay, an early idol of

00:32:42.851 --> 00:32:46.313
Lincoln's.
Lincoln wrote of Clay,

00:32:46.313 --> 00:32:51.015
"He loved his country," he
said, "partly because it was his

00:32:51.015 --> 00:32:54.987
own country"--partly
because it was his own

00:32:54.987 --> 00:32:59.690
country--;"but mainly because it
was a free country."

00:32:59.690 --> 00:33:03.013
His point, I think,
is that Clay exhibited,

00:33:03.013 --> 00:33:07.920
at least on Lincoln's telling,
something of the philosopher,

00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:12.269
what he loved was an idea,
the idea of freedom.

00:33:12.269 --> 00:33:17.952
That idea was not the property
of one particular country,

00:33:17.952 --> 00:33:22.619
but it was constitutive of any
good society.

00:33:22.619 --> 00:33:25.635
The good human being,
it would seem,

00:33:25.635 --> 00:33:29.512
would be a philosopher,
or at least would have

00:33:29.512 --> 00:33:33.390
something philosophical about
him or her,

00:33:33.390 --> 00:33:37.940
and who may only be fully at
home in the best regime.

00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:42.620
But of course the best regime
lacks actuality.

00:33:42.620 --> 00:33:45.020
We all know that.
It has never existed.

00:33:49.089 --> 00:33:52.087
The best regime embodies a
supreme paradox,

00:33:52.087 --> 00:33:55.542
it would seem.
It is superior in some ways to

00:33:55.542 --> 00:33:58.703
all actual regimes,
but it has no concrete

00:33:58.703 --> 00:34:02.218
existence anywhere.
This makes it difficult,

00:34:02.218 --> 00:34:05.476
you could say and this is
Aristotle's point,

00:34:05.476 --> 00:34:08.959
I think,
this makes it difficult for the

00:34:08.959 --> 00:34:13.659
philosopher to be a good citizen
of any actual regime.

00:34:13.659 --> 00:34:19.065
Philosophy will never feel
fully or truly at home in any

00:34:19.065 --> 00:34:24.532
particular society.
The philosopher can never be

00:34:24.532 --> 00:34:30.849
truly loyal to anyone or
anything but what is best.

00:34:30.849 --> 00:34:34.308
Think of that:
it raises a question about

00:34:34.308 --> 00:34:37.940
issues of love,
loyalty, and friendship.

00:34:41.670 --> 00:34:45.333
This tension,
of course, between the best

00:34:45.333 --> 00:34:50.921
regime and any actual regime is
the space that makes political

00:34:50.921 --> 00:34:54.870
philosophy possible.
In the best regime,

00:34:54.870 --> 00:35:00.030
if we were to inhabit such,
political philosophy would be

00:35:00.030 --> 00:35:07.079
unnecessary or redundant.
It would wither away.

00:35:07.079 --> 00:35:13.050
Political philosophy exists and
only exists in that...

00:35:13.050 --> 00:35:18.844
call it "zone of indeterminacy"
between the "is" and the

00:35:18.844 --> 00:35:23.480
"ought," between the actual and
the ideal.

00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:27.872
This is why political
philosophy is always and

00:35:27.872 --> 00:35:32.849
necessarily a potentially
disturbing undertaking.

00:35:32.849 --> 00:35:37.751
Those who embark on the quest
for knowledge of the best regime

00:35:37.751 --> 00:35:42.170
may not return the same people
that they were before.

00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:50.021
You may return with very
different loyalties and

00:35:50.021 --> 00:35:54.309
allegiances than you had in the
beginning.

00:35:54.309 --> 00:35:59.840
But there is some compensation
for this, I think.

00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:03.998
The ancients had a beautiful
word, or at least the Greeks had

00:36:03.998 --> 00:36:06.216
a beautiful word,
for this quest,

00:36:06.216 --> 00:36:09.889
for this desire for knowledge
of the best regime.

00:36:09.889 --> 00:36:18.230
They called it eros, or
love, right?

00:36:18.230 --> 00:36:24.446
The quest for knowledge of the
best regime must necessarily be

00:36:24.446 --> 00:36:29.949
accompanied, sustained,
and elevated by eros.

00:36:29.949 --> 00:36:34.367
You may not have realized it
when you walked in to this class

00:36:34.367 --> 00:36:38.343
today, but the study of
political philosophy may be the

00:36:38.343 --> 00:36:40.920
highest tribute we pay to love.

00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:48.904
Think of that.
And while you're thinking about

00:36:48.904 --> 00:36:52.833
it you can start reading Plato's
Apology for Socrates

00:36:52.833 --> 00:36:56.030
which we will discuss for class
on Wednesday.

00:36:56.030 --> 00:37:00.796
Okay?
It's nice to see you back,

00:37:00.796 --> 00:37:05.000
and have a very good but
thoughtful September 11^(th).

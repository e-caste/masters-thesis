00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.312
Prof: Okay,
so we saw last time that Lewis

00:00:05.312 --> 00:00:06.270
wasn't so dumb.
 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.330
He knew about Earnshaw's
theorem, but he still thought

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:14.390
there was an octet of electrons
around the nucleus.

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:16.650
How could he think such a thing?
 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.732
Because if you have
inverse-square force laws you

00:00:19.732 --> 00:00:22.880
can't have static positions of
charged things,

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.790
unless they're right on top of
one another or blown apart.

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:29.900
So what did he think?
 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.360
Student:  It's not an
inverse-square.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.006
Prof: That it's not an
inverse-square force law,

00:00:34.006 --> 00:00:36.849
that Coulomb's law breaks down
when you get to a very small

00:00:36.849 --> 00:00:37.340
scale.
 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.851
And J.J. Thomson thought the
same thing, and wrote here these

00:00:41.851 --> 00:00:43.280
two terms here.
 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.922
The first one is Coulomb's law
indeed, but there's this other

00:00:47.922 --> 00:00:49.470
thing, c/r.
 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.980
So as long as r is very
big you don't compare -- you

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.066
don't care about that term,
as long as it's very big

00:00:56.066 --> 00:00:57.580
compared to c.
 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:01.591
And c is a distance
that's something like the size

00:01:01.591 --> 00:01:02.380
of atoms.
 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:04.882
So once r -- once the
distance of the things that are

00:01:04.882 --> 00:01:08.763
interacting with one another,
the electron and the nucleus

00:01:08.763 --> 00:01:13.090
say, once they get near the
distance c,

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:20.909
then this c/r thing
becomes significant,

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:26.290
if r becomes very small,
and it even changes the sign.

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.159
So what was attractive becomes
repulsive.

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.140
So that would do okay then for
a structure.

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.330
That was in 1923.
 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.183
In 1926, just three years
later, quantum mechanics came

00:01:39.183 --> 00:01:42.679
along and showed that Coulomb's
law was just fine,

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:45.319
nothing wrong with Coulomb's
law.

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:47.644
It goes to much,
much, much, 10^20th,

00:01:47.644 --> 00:01:50.420
smaller distances than the size
of atoms.

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.620
Coulomb's law still works.
 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:57.375
What was wrong was the way they
treated kinetic energy,

00:01:57.375 --> 00:02:01.269
because kinetic energy quantum
mechanics reformulates.

00:02:01.269 --> 00:02:03.819
So it gives you electron clouds.
 

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:07.650
And so what's a cloud is not
the positive charge -- remember,

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.288
J.J. Thomson had a positive
sphere of electricity in which

00:02:11.288 --> 00:02:15.161
he embedded the electrons --
what's a cloud is the

00:02:15.161 --> 00:02:18.240
electrons, and nuclei are put in
it,

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.240
to make molecules.
 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.979
So it really is -- he was right
about plum-puddings,

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:27.620
he just had the charges
backwards.

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.990
Not many people give him credit
for that.

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:34.441
So cubic octets of Lewis and
ad hoc electrostatic

00:02:34.441 --> 00:02:37.458
force laws,
like this c/r term in

00:02:37.458 --> 00:02:39.330
there,
soon disappeared from

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.490
conventional chemistry and
physics;

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:45.860
immediately in fact,
I mean within a month say.

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.583
But the idea of shared-pairs,
and lone-pairs,

00:02:49.583 --> 00:02:53.729
that Lewis came up with,
remained useful tools for

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:56.860
discussing structure and
bonding.

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.141
So we still do it,
and that's why you did problems

00:02:59.141 --> 00:03:00.680
today that had to do with that.
 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:01.960
Yes Niko?
 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:03.158
Student:  Yes.
 

00:03:03.158 --> 00:03:05.430
Can you explain the kinetic
energy theorem again?

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.763
Prof: Yes,
but I won't do it for a week

00:03:08.763 --> 00:03:11.800
still, because it takes a little
while.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:18.246
Okay, so Earnshaw said there's
no structure of minimum energy

00:03:18.246 --> 00:03:21.867
for point charges --
that is, no classical one --

00:03:21.867 --> 00:03:24.474
but if you come to quantum
mechanics and fiddle around with

00:03:24.474 --> 00:03:28.210
kinetic energy,
then you can get it.

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:33.210
But despite Earnshaw,
might Lewis have been right?

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:37.175
Might there still be
shared-pair bonds and

00:03:37.175 --> 00:03:38.250
lone-pairs?
 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.160
What are bonds?
 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.470
And that's what we're going to
try to find out.

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.410
And how do you know,
or how do you know?

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.210
How are we going to know
whether there are electron pairs

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:55.009
that are shared between atoms
and lone-pairs on atoms?

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:58.210
How can we find out?
 

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:59.150
Student: Experiment.
 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:00.379
Prof: Right.
 

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:01.979
You've got to do an experiment.
 

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:03.259
So what kind of experiment?
 

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:05.259
Now these experiments are tough.
 

00:04:05.259 --> 00:04:08.090
Why are the experiments tough?
 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.990
Student: It's so small.
 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.718
Student:  It's really
small.

00:04:09.718 --> 00:04:13.075
Prof: Because things are
-- well we could see,

00:04:13.075 --> 00:04:16.819
or we could feel whether these
electron pairs are there.

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:20.247
But there's a problem,
as you say, that it's

00:04:20.247 --> 00:04:24.074
inconceivably small,
the thing we're looking for,

00:04:24.074 --> 00:04:25.829
to see or to feel.
 

00:04:25.829 --> 00:04:27.028
Okay?
 

00:04:27.028 --> 00:04:31.500
But is it really inconceivable
how small they are?

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.235
When I was in your place
everybody thought yes,

00:04:34.235 --> 00:04:37.029
they're inconceivably small,
we'll forget it.

00:04:37.029 --> 00:04:37.670
Right?
 

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:41.002
But there are more recent
techniques that suggest that you

00:04:41.002 --> 00:04:43.050
can really see things that
small;

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:47.100
at least you can think about
them clearly.

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:53.629
Now, the first idea of seeing
them came from this book here.

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:56.435
Actually this book was
published -- this is a Third

00:04:56.435 --> 00:04:57.670
Edition of the book.
 

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:01.355
The First Edition was 1909 and
the Second was 1919,

00:05:01.355 --> 00:05:05.560
and this is the Third Edition,
which is still in print.

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.709
You can go on the web and buy
this baby,

00:05:07.709 --> 00:05:10.108
Occult Chemistry,
A Series of Clairvoyant

00:05:10.108 --> 00:05:12.620
Observations on the Chemical
Elements,

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:16.310
by Annie Besant and Charles
Leadbeater.

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:20.067
So these are the occult
chemists who started practicing

00:05:20.067 --> 00:05:21.600
their trade in 1895.
 

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.129
"Bishop"
Charles Webster Leadbeater;

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:27.478
he was a bishop of a church he
founded that had -- he was the

00:05:27.478 --> 00:05:31.225
head bishop;
there were like 100 bishops and

00:05:31.225 --> 00:05:34.000
500 members of the religion.
 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.050
This is Annie Besant,
who is one of the most

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:39.819
interesting people in all of
history.

00:05:39.819 --> 00:05:44.588
They closed the stock exchange
in India the day she died,

00:05:44.588 --> 00:05:45.779
for example.
 

00:05:45.779 --> 00:05:51.077
This is in her -- the outfit
she designed to lead the Boy

00:05:51.077 --> 00:05:52.779
Scouts in India.
 

00:05:52.779 --> 00:05:57.860
And she also proposed marriage
to George Bernard Shaw.

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:59.812
There are all sorts of
interesting things about Annie

00:05:59.812 --> 00:06:00.149
Besant.
 

00:06:00.149 --> 00:06:03.488
But one of the things we're
interested in is that she could

00:06:03.488 --> 00:06:04.180
see atoms.
 

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:08.714
And then their helper,
who became leader of the

00:06:08.714 --> 00:06:12.560
operation later on,
was Jinarajadasa.

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.930
Okay, so this is a page from
this book,

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:19.399
from the paper that became the
book in 1895,

00:06:19.399 --> 00:06:22.233
which shows what they could see
for hydrogen,

00:06:22.233 --> 00:06:23.649
oxygen and nitrogen.
 

00:06:23.649 --> 00:06:26.189
Now there are a number of
levels here.

00:06:26.189 --> 00:06:31.567
The very lowest phase is solid,
H O N, then liquid,

00:06:31.567 --> 00:06:32.750
then gas.
 

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:35.146
So this is what,
when they went into sort of a

00:06:35.146 --> 00:06:36.480
trance, they could see.
 

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:38.980
This is the gas.
 

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:43.161
But then there's Ethereal 4,
Ethereal 3, Ethereal 2 and

00:06:43.161 --> 00:06:46.877
Ethereal 1 phases as well,
with higher and higher

00:06:46.877 --> 00:06:48.040
resolution.
 

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:48.930
You can see these.
 

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:52.360
So these, for example,
these little dots that you see

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:55.884
here are what get blown up here,
and the little things inside

00:06:55.884 --> 00:06:58.442
this are what get blown up here,
and the things inside this get

00:06:58.442 --> 00:07:01.153
blown up here,
and the things inside this are

00:07:01.153 --> 00:07:03.701
this;
and that's the same for all

00:07:03.701 --> 00:07:06.528
atoms, that's the fundamental
unit.

00:07:06.528 --> 00:07:11.730
Okay, so here's hydrogen at the
gas resolution level.

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:15.120
So there are wheels in wheels
in wheels here.

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:16.829
And here's what oxygen looks
like;

00:07:16.829 --> 00:07:20.589
it's these little helices.
 

00:07:20.589 --> 00:07:23.600
And now that's the thing you
finally get to,

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:25.699
the thing called anu.
 

00:07:25.699 --> 00:07:28.798
And that they actually ripped
off from this book,

00:07:28.798 --> 00:07:32.735
The Principles of Color,
which was published in America

00:07:32.735 --> 00:07:34.930
in 1878 by Edwin D. Babbitt.
 

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:38.029
And here's his picture of this
thing.

00:07:38.029 --> 00:07:41.074
And lo and behold,
that's what they saw as the

00:07:41.074 --> 00:07:43.509
fundamental constituent of
matter.

00:07:43.509 --> 00:07:45.209
It's fun to look at in detail.
 

00:07:45.209 --> 00:07:47.769
You can look at it at the Web,
if you want to.

00:07:47.769 --> 00:07:52.788
It also has pictures of the
Angel of Innocence here,

00:07:52.788 --> 00:07:58.199
and the psycho-magnetic curves
surrounding your head.

00:07:58.199 --> 00:08:04.035
Okay, now lo and behold the
real confirmation of this thing

00:08:04.035 --> 00:08:09.771
was that if you counted up the
anu in the different

00:08:09.771 --> 00:08:13.142
elements,
there were eighteen anu

00:08:13.142 --> 00:08:16.747
in hydrogen,
290 in oxygen and 261 in

00:08:16.747 --> 00:08:22.009
nitrogen, and if you divide that
by eighteen,

00:08:22.009 --> 00:08:29.560
you get the atomic weights,
Q.E.D. Okay,

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:32.509
so they have pictures in this
book of a bunch of the atoms.

00:08:32.509 --> 00:08:35.147
This is helium,
which has seventy-two

00:08:35.147 --> 00:08:36.100
anu.
 

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:39.360
This is lithium with 127
anu.

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:42.928
Not the bottom part;
this is a model and this is the

00:08:42.928 --> 00:08:44.980
wooden base it sits on.
 

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:49.370
Here's iron, 1008 anu.
 

00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:52.950
Here's neon, 360 anu.
 

00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:59.102
Now look at neon,
and that is a 4f orbital

00:08:59.102 --> 00:09:03.975
electron density,
calculated by quantum

00:09:03.975 --> 00:09:05.769
mechanics.
 

00:09:05.769 --> 00:09:08.976
Now the question is,
why would you believe me,

00:09:08.976 --> 00:09:11.971
or believe a textbook,
or believe a quantum

00:09:11.971 --> 00:09:14.678
mechanician, and not believe
them?

00:09:14.678 --> 00:09:19.970
Because they said they saw it
too.

00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:20.570
Okay?
 

00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:21.798
Well it takes time.
 

00:09:21.798 --> 00:09:25.494
We've talked about this before,
the basis for scientific

00:09:25.494 --> 00:09:28.448
belief: evidence,
you always cross-examine an

00:09:28.448 --> 00:09:31.775
assertion; logic;
and taste, but taste matures

00:09:31.775 --> 00:09:35.610
with experience and at the
beginning you don't know which

00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:38.759
people to believe and which not
to believe.

00:09:38.759 --> 00:09:41.590
It's a problem in politics too.
 

00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:44.408
Okay, there's sodium, 418.
 

00:09:44.408 --> 00:09:49.330
They not only said they saw
atoms, they also saw molecules.

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:52.529
For example,
here is sodium carbonate.

00:09:52.529 --> 00:09:57.129
What do you see in there?
 

00:09:57.129 --> 00:09:59.659
Two sodiums, right?
 

00:09:59.659 --> 00:10:00.750
Okay?
 

00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:03.750
In the back are pieces of a
carbon atom.

00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:05.299
What else do you see?
 

00:10:05.299 --> 00:10:06.490
Students:  Oxygen.
 

00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:08.743
Prof: Ah,
there are three oxygen helices

00:10:08.743 --> 00:10:10.850
wrapped around the sodium and
the carbon.

00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:14.317
And they wrote:
"Note that this triangular

00:10:14.317 --> 00:10:19.067
arrangement of O_3 has just been
deduced by Bragg from his X-ray

00:10:19.067 --> 00:10:21.330
analysis of Calcite."
 

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:24.649
We'll talk about Bragg and what
he was doing next time.

00:10:24.649 --> 00:10:28.389
But they have experimental
evidence that supports what

00:10:28.389 --> 00:10:31.351
they're reporting,
independent experimental

00:10:31.351 --> 00:10:32.269
evidence.
 

00:10:32.269 --> 00:10:36.808
Here's their model of benzene,
and they say about that,

00:10:36.808 --> 00:10:40.452
"Each of the three
valencies of each Carbon are

00:10:40.452 --> 00:10:43.365
satisfied by Hydrogen,
and the fourth valency,

00:10:43.365 --> 00:10:46.153
which some have postulated as
going to the interior of the

00:10:46.153 --> 00:10:49.690
molecule,
does actually do so."

00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:53.419
In fact, Annie Besant was the
first woman to get a degree in

00:10:53.419 --> 00:10:55.950
Chemistry at the University of
London;

00:10:55.950 --> 00:10:56.950
but that's another story.
 

00:10:56.950 --> 00:11:01.275
Her teacher was the guy who
translated Das Kapital

00:11:01.275 --> 00:11:03.980
into English,
and had a lot of other

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:06.528
nefarious things that he did.
 

00:11:06.528 --> 00:11:09.220
Question six will have to do
with that.

00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:12.370
Okay, so here's benzene and its
resonance.

00:11:12.370 --> 00:11:15.529
These were structures that were
first early proposed;

00:11:15.529 --> 00:11:17.600
we'll talk about that later on.
 

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:20.924
But some people didn't like
this idea of going back and

00:11:20.924 --> 00:11:24.450
forth between two things,
and they thought that you just

00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:28.289
have the fourth valence of every
carbon going into the middle,

00:11:28.289 --> 00:11:31.168
all satisfying one another.
 

00:11:31.168 --> 00:11:35.587
So this was what they said that
their model confirmed,

00:11:35.587 --> 00:11:39.923
that the fourth valence of
every carbon goes into the

00:11:39.923 --> 00:11:40.840
middle.
 

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:44.582
Okay, needless to say most
people nowadays don't think too

00:11:44.582 --> 00:11:48.129
much of occult chemistry,
even if you can still buy the

00:11:48.129 --> 00:11:49.178
book online.
 

00:11:49.178 --> 00:11:52.288
This portal you came through
this morning.

00:11:52.288 --> 00:11:56.529
It says "Erected
1921".

00:11:56.529 --> 00:12:00.426
But here's the same place,
in 1923, when the building was

00:12:00.426 --> 00:12:04.669
dedicated, and you notice those
plaques weren't carved yet.

00:12:04.669 --> 00:12:06.908
It didn't say erected 1921.
 

00:12:06.908 --> 00:12:10.048
They were still finishing the
building at the time the

00:12:10.048 --> 00:12:13.543
American Chemical Society had
their national meeting here to

00:12:13.543 --> 00:12:17.038
celebrate the biggest academic
building for chemistry in the

00:12:17.038 --> 00:12:17.750
world.
 

00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:19.000
Okay?
 

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.038
So the slates were clean.
 

00:12:21.038 --> 00:12:24.142
Now if you go down into the
crowd here, you see some

00:12:24.142 --> 00:12:25.418
interesting people.
 

00:12:25.418 --> 00:12:28.533
For example,
there's G.N. Lewis with his

00:12:28.533 --> 00:12:31.330
Philippines' cigar in his hand.
 

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:34.129
He always had a cigar;
he smoked seventeen cigars a

00:12:34.129 --> 00:12:34.470
day.
 

00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:36.759
&gt;
 

00:12:36.759 --> 00:12:38.320
Groan.
 

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:42.443
Okay, but they were trying to
decide how to decorate all these

00:12:42.443 --> 00:12:45.961
plaques around the building,
and they wanted to put the

00:12:45.961 --> 00:12:48.259
names of distinguished American
chemists.

00:12:48.259 --> 00:12:50.428
Had they done that,
it would be pretty much a

00:12:50.428 --> 00:12:53.533
disaster because the people who
were thought to be distinguished

00:12:53.533 --> 00:12:56.392
American chemists in those days
were not so hot actually in

00:12:56.392 --> 00:12:57.230
retrospect.
 

00:12:57.230 --> 00:13:01.169
But they chose a wonderful
group, and the idea came from

00:13:01.169 --> 00:13:05.253
Giuseppe Bruni from Bologna who
had come to the meeting to

00:13:05.253 --> 00:13:05.970
speak.
 

00:13:05.970 --> 00:13:09.166
And he said,
"Don't put living chemists

00:13:09.166 --> 00:13:11.620
there, put dead chemists."
 

00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:13.953
And that's what they did;
in almost all cases they were

00:13:13.953 --> 00:13:14.279
dead.
 

00:13:14.279 --> 00:13:19.147
And it's a wonderful group;
as we've already used Faraday

00:13:19.147 --> 00:13:20.058
over here.
 

00:13:20.058 --> 00:13:22.465
Okay, here's one of them that's
over in that corner of the

00:13:22.465 --> 00:13:22.928
building.
 

00:13:22.928 --> 00:13:27.090
And van't Hoff,
have you heard of van't Hoff?

00:13:27.090 --> 00:13:29.539
You'll have heard a lot of him
by the end of this semester.

00:13:29.539 --> 00:13:30.759
And Gibbs?
 

00:13:30.759 --> 00:13:31.389
Students:  Yes.
 

00:13:31.389 --> 00:13:33.340
Prof: Yes Gibbs,
we'll talk about him too.

00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:36.379
And Mendeleev you've heard of.
 

00:13:36.379 --> 00:13:40.129
But I suspect that Crookes is
not so familiar to you.

00:13:40.129 --> 00:13:42.038
This is Sir William Crookes.
 

00:13:42.038 --> 00:13:47.940
He was a Fellow of the Royal
Society, and FTS.

00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:51.330
In 1861 he discovered the
element thallium.

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:54.524
He also developed the cathode
ray tube, which he's holding

00:13:54.524 --> 00:13:57.549
there, which became the x-ray
tube, and he invented the

00:13:57.549 --> 00:13:58.840
Cooke's radiometer.
 

00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:00.940
I bet every one of you has seen
a Cooke's radiometer.

00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:03.370
Do you know?
 

00:14:03.370 --> 00:14:06.541
There's a picture of a Cooke's
radiometer, to measure the

00:14:06.541 --> 00:14:08.918
intensity of light by how fast
it spins.

00:14:08.918 --> 00:14:12.024
You've seen these things you
buy in novelty stores that sit

00:14:12.024 --> 00:14:13.629
there and spin in the light.
 

00:14:13.629 --> 00:14:15.360
Okay?
 

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:18.596
From 1913 to 1916 he was
President of the Royal Society,

00:14:18.596 --> 00:14:22.129
the same thing that was founded
back by Boyle -- remember?

00:14:22.129 --> 00:14:24.240
-- and Robert Hooke and those
guys.

00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:27.816
In 1898 he was President of the
British Association for the

00:14:27.816 --> 00:14:30.735
Advancement of Science,
and he was also,

00:14:30.735 --> 00:14:34.109
in that year,
President of the Society for

00:14:34.109 --> 00:14:35.918
Psychical Research.
 

00:14:35.918 --> 00:14:41.220
And FTS is Fellow of the
Theosophical Society.

00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:45.258
In his presidential lecture to
the British Association for the

00:14:45.258 --> 00:14:48.923
Advancement of Science,
one of the things he said was,

00:14:48.923 --> 00:14:52.809
"Telepathic research does
not yet enlist the interest of

00:14:52.809 --> 00:14:55.918
the majority of my scientific
brethren."

00:14:55.918 --> 00:15:03.693
But he's the guy who supplied
the samples for Leadbeater and

00:15:03.693 --> 00:15:06.330
Besant to look at.
 

00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:08.658
He supplied them with lithium,
chromium,

00:15:08.658 --> 00:15:11.735
selenium, titanium,
vanadium, boron and beryllium

00:15:11.735 --> 00:15:15.707
samples so that they could draw
these pictures of what they saw

00:15:15.707 --> 00:15:16.990
by clairvoyance.
 

00:15:16.990 --> 00:15:19.120
So you can read more on the Web
if you want to about him,

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:20.340
he's an interesting character.
 

00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:23.788
And there were a lot of semi-,
well really serious scientists.

00:15:23.788 --> 00:15:26.835
Oliver Lodge was another one
who invented radio and was head

00:15:26.835 --> 00:15:28.899
of the Physics Department at
Bristol,

00:15:28.899 --> 00:15:32.818
I think , who was into
communicating with the dead and

00:15:32.818 --> 00:15:34.149
stuff like that.
 

00:15:34.149 --> 00:15:38.298
So it wasn't obvious at the
beginning who you should believe

00:15:38.298 --> 00:15:40.548
and who you shouldn't believe.
 

00:15:40.548 --> 00:15:43.807
But to get back to the point,
and forget clairvoyance for

00:15:43.807 --> 00:15:46.267
awhile,
which I don't believe in,

00:15:46.267 --> 00:15:49.537
the question is,
are molecules unobservably

00:15:49.537 --> 00:15:53.519
small for what Newton called
"vulgar eyes"?

00:15:53.519 --> 00:15:56.893
Is there no way we can see
something and measure it if it's

00:15:56.893 --> 00:15:57.649
that small?
 

00:15:57.649 --> 00:15:59.750
So consider water.
 

00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:04.017
A cubic centimeter of water is
1/18th of a mole,

00:16:04.017 --> 00:16:07.740
since the molecular weight is
eighteen.

00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:13.365
That means it's 6/18^th times
10^23rd molecules,

00:16:13.365 --> 00:16:15.639
in a cc of water.
 

00:16:15.639 --> 00:16:19.013
Now that's a really,
really big number and it sounds

00:16:19.013 --> 00:16:21.592
like they must be just
impossibly small,

00:16:21.592 --> 00:16:24.240
hopeless to try to see such a
thing.

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:28.774
But the difference is between
the cube and the cube root,

00:16:28.774 --> 00:16:32.825
because when we measure
distance we measure linear,

00:16:32.825 --> 00:16:34.038
not volume.
 

00:16:34.038 --> 00:16:37.889
So to get something about
distances you take the cube root

00:16:37.889 --> 00:16:38.970
of the volume.
 

00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:44.376
So if we take the cube root of
that, it's about three times

00:16:44.376 --> 00:16:45.029
10^7.
 

00:16:45.029 --> 00:16:48.990
Now that's still a very big
number, 30,000,000.

00:16:48.990 --> 00:16:49.830
Right?
 

00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:52.808
But it's not impossibly small.
 

00:16:52.808 --> 00:16:56.429
It's about -- 3 angstroms is
this dimension,

00:16:56.429 --> 00:16:59.038
the size of a water molecule.
 

00:16:59.038 --> 00:17:02.443
Remember, we'll talk a lot
about a carbon bond --

00:17:02.443 --> 00:17:05.635
carbon-carbon bond,
being about one and a half

00:17:05.635 --> 00:17:06.630
angstroms.
 

00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:13.932
Okay, now think about 10^5.^(
)So this lecture room is about

00:17:13.932 --> 00:17:16.160
ten meters wide.
 

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:21.702
One of my hairs is order of
magnitude 100 microns in

00:17:21.702 --> 00:17:25.940
diameter, and that's a ratio of
10^5.

00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:26.519
Right?
 

00:17:26.519 --> 00:17:30.069
So 10^5 of my hairs sideways
would go across this room.

00:17:30.069 --> 00:17:32.089
So that's a lot.
 

00:17:32.089 --> 00:17:32.630
Right?
 

00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:35.640
But it's not impossible to
think of lining up hairs to go

00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:38.220
across the room,
or putting them side by side.

00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:40.721
It'd take a while,
but it's not impossible to

00:17:40.721 --> 00:17:43.450
think about that,
a hair compared to the room.

00:17:43.450 --> 00:17:44.368
Right?
 

00:17:44.368 --> 00:17:48.241
But a molecule is about a
nanometer, and a small atom is

00:17:48.241 --> 00:17:51.339
about 1/10 of a nanometer,
or an angstrom.

00:17:51.339 --> 00:17:51.960
Right?
 

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:54.750
And that ratio is 10^5.
 

00:17:54.750 --> 00:18:00.760
So the room to my hair is like
my hair to a molecule,

00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:04.230
or even an atom,
a big atom.

00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:09.124
So it's not impossibly small,
it's just very,

00:18:09.124 --> 00:18:10.568
very small.
 

00:18:10.568 --> 00:18:17.059
In fact, a nucleus is 10
femtometers, which is another

00:18:17.059 --> 00:18:18.528
10^5 down.
 

00:18:18.528 --> 00:18:22.608
So that means if the lecture
room were an atom,

00:18:22.608 --> 00:18:26.690
the nucleus would be the
diameter of a hair;

00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:31.359
very small, but not impossibly
small to conceive of.

00:18:31.359 --> 00:18:32.818
Okay?
 

00:18:32.818 --> 00:18:35.940
Now Newton, in Opticks,
the book we looked at before,

00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:40.321
in 1717 wrote on page 369:
"The thickness of the

00:18:40.321 --> 00:18:43.440
Plate where it appears very
black,

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:48.356
is three eights of the ten
hundred thousandth part of an

00:18:48.356 --> 00:18:49.519
Inch."
 

00:18:49.519 --> 00:18:54.045
"Is"
- that means he knew the size

00:18:54.045 --> 00:18:54.769
of it.
 

00:18:54.769 --> 00:18:58.265
Now how big is three-eighths of
a ten-hundred-thousandth part of

00:18:58.265 --> 00:18:58.818
an inch?
 

00:18:58.818 --> 00:19:01.380
Well ten-hundred-thousand is a
million;

00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:05.309
three-eights of a millionth of
an inch is thirty water

00:19:05.309 --> 00:19:06.200
molecules.
 

00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:10.365
So somehow Newton was able to
measure something,

00:19:10.365 --> 00:19:15.240
in 1717, that was the size of
thirty water molecules.

00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:20.193
Now what tool could Newton
possibly have had in 1717 that

00:19:20.193 --> 00:19:24.529
allowed him to measure something
so very small?

00:19:24.529 --> 00:19:29.640
What?
 

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:30.450
Student:  Glass ring.
 

00:19:30.450 --> 00:19:31.119
Prof: Can't hear very
well.

00:19:31.119 --> 00:19:32.410
Student:  Glass ring.
 

00:19:32.410 --> 00:19:33.548
Prof: Glass springs?
 

00:19:33.548 --> 00:19:34.920
Student:  Ring,
like you would --

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:36.960
Prof: That's right.
 

00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:38.680
Okay, so here it is,
Newton's Rings,

00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:40.338
which really should be called
Hooke's Rings,

00:19:40.338 --> 00:19:44.944
because he's the guy that in
Micrographia published

00:19:44.944 --> 00:19:46.400
how they worked.
 

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:47.949
But remember,
they had different light

00:19:47.949 --> 00:19:48.410
theories.
 

00:19:48.410 --> 00:19:55.358
So here are two pieces of
glass, two disks of glass.

00:19:55.358 --> 00:19:58.598
And I'll change the lights so
we see light through them.

00:19:58.598 --> 00:20:06.140
Now I can't remember which is
which, but let me guess that if

00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:13.430
I put this one over here,
having turned it over -- okay.

00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:15.910
Oh I can see, yes you can see.
 

00:20:15.910 --> 00:20:17.259
See those patterns?
 

00:20:17.259 --> 00:20:20.583
You've seen things like that
with microscope slides,

00:20:20.583 --> 00:20:21.170
colors.
 

00:20:21.170 --> 00:20:22.650
Okay?
 

00:20:22.650 --> 00:20:26.134
So these are two flats against
one another, they get very close

00:20:26.134 --> 00:20:27.088
to one another.
 

00:20:27.088 --> 00:20:33.788
But if I turn the top one over,
you see that it's a little bit

00:20:33.788 --> 00:20:38.400
-- let me -- so that's what we
just saw.

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:42.500
But notice that if I turn it
over there's a little --

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:45.826
there turns out here at the
edge to be a little bit of a

00:20:45.826 --> 00:20:48.095
gap,
because the top one is just

00:20:48.095 --> 00:20:49.598
very slightly curved.
 

00:20:49.598 --> 00:20:55.019
And now let me see if I can see
something.

00:20:55.019 --> 00:21:01.858
I can't see it yet,
let me zoom in.

00:21:01.858 --> 00:21:09.359
We're going to need to focus on
that.

00:21:09.359 --> 00:21:12.650
Ah, see that thing, see that.
 

00:21:12.650 --> 00:21:46.059
&lt;&lt;Technical
adjustment&gt;&gt;

00:21:46.059 --> 00:21:47.440
There.
 

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:53.519
Okay, so here's what you're
seeing.

00:21:53.519 --> 00:21:56.289
In the middle is what's called
Newton's Rings.

00:21:56.289 --> 00:21:57.819
They look like that.
 

00:21:57.819 --> 00:22:00.720
Different colors, right?
 

00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:06.144
And Newton could measure the
thickness of the air gap that

00:22:06.144 --> 00:22:08.618
caused different colors.
 

00:22:08.618 --> 00:22:12.440
The colors repeat in higher
orders.

00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:13.740
Okay?
 

00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:16.868
Now how could he know the
distance?

00:22:16.868 --> 00:22:21.549
So he could associate every
color with a distance.

00:22:21.549 --> 00:22:26.269
How could he know the distance?
 

00:22:26.269 --> 00:22:31.308
Because he could measure the
diameter of the rings.

00:22:31.308 --> 00:22:34.067
And he said this:
"Observation Six:

00:22:34.067 --> 00:22:37.318
The Diameter of the fixth
Ring" (Right?

00:22:37.318 --> 00:22:40.015
One, two, three,
four, five, six) "at the

00:22:40.015 --> 00:22:43.430
most lucid part of its Orbit was
58/100ths of an inch,

00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:47.727
and the Diameter of the Sphere
on which the double convex

00:22:47.727 --> 00:22:51.180
Object-glass was ground was
about 102 Feet;

00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:54.997
hence I gathered the thickness
of the Air or Aereal Interval of

00:22:54.997 --> 00:22:57.029
the Glasses in that Ring."
 

00:22:57.029 --> 00:23:00.442
So in other words,
here's the air gap he's trying

00:23:00.442 --> 00:23:03.430
to measure, which is the sixth
ring out.

00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:07.259
He knows the diameter of that
ring.

00:23:07.259 --> 00:23:11.140
He knows that they touch in the
middle, the two glasses,

00:23:11.140 --> 00:23:15.585
and he knows that it's a sphere
and it has a radius of fifty-one

00:23:15.585 --> 00:23:16.220
feet.
 

00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:21.866
So he can just use trigonometry
to figure out that the air gap,

00:23:21.866 --> 00:23:26.969
if he knows that angle there,
the air gap is 1.8 microns,

00:23:26.969 --> 00:23:27.880
right?
 

00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:30.220
So that's a lot bigger than an
atom;

00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:32.936
but if you go into the first
ring, or even closer,

00:23:32.936 --> 00:23:34.380
then you can measure it.
 

00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:34.970
Right?
 

00:23:34.970 --> 00:23:39.104
So all he needed was a
spherical glass with a very

00:23:39.104 --> 00:23:43.828
large radius that he could
measure his distances from.

00:23:43.828 --> 00:23:48.287
Okay, but here's a simpler
measure of an even smaller

00:23:48.287 --> 00:23:53.859
distance, about 100 years later,
and here's the guy who did it.

00:23:53.859 --> 00:23:55.058
You know who that is?
 

00:23:55.058 --> 00:24:01.450
&lt;&lt;Students speak over one
another&gt;&gt;

00:24:01.450 --> 00:24:03.088
Prof: Benjamin Franklin
of course;

00:24:03.088 --> 00:24:06.250
we'll get back to the artist
later on.

00:24:06.250 --> 00:24:09.212
So he published in the
Philosophical Transactions of

00:24:09.212 --> 00:24:13.294
the Royal Society in 1774 --
the Society is now

00:24:13.294 --> 00:24:17.230
110-years-old,
114-years-old --

00:24:17.230 --> 00:24:24.730
this article on the stilling of
waves by means of oil.

00:24:24.730 --> 00:24:29.240
Can you see what that means?
 

00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:33.650
What's that related to,
a common saying?

00:24:33.650 --> 00:24:34.970
Student:  Separation?
 

00:24:34.970 --> 00:24:38.549
Prof: Pouring oil on
troubled waters;

00:24:38.549 --> 00:24:40.279
have you heard of that one?
 

00:24:40.279 --> 00:24:42.558
So the stilling of waves by
means of oil.

00:24:42.558 --> 00:24:47.250
Extracted from sundry letters
between Franklin and Brownrigg.

00:24:47.250 --> 00:24:49.730
So he wrote to Brownrigg,
1773: "I had,

00:24:49.730 --> 00:24:52.790
when a youth,
read and smiled at Pliny's

00:24:52.790 --> 00:24:57.029
account of a practice among the
seamen of his time,

00:24:57.029 --> 00:25:01.588
to still the waves in a storm
by pouring oil into the sea;

00:25:01.588 --> 00:25:04.618
as well as the use made of oil
by the divers…."

00:25:04.618 --> 00:25:07.470
Pearl divers would fill their
mouth with oil and when they

00:25:07.470 --> 00:25:09.558
went down,
if a breeze came up and ruffled

00:25:09.558 --> 00:25:11.353
the surface,
which made it hard to see

00:25:11.353 --> 00:25:13.640
because the light wouldn't come
through clearly,

00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:15.967
then they'd let oil out of
their mouths that would float to

00:25:15.967 --> 00:25:17.559
the surface,
stop the ripples,

00:25:17.559 --> 00:25:19.890
and they could see to get their
pearls.

00:25:19.890 --> 00:25:21.769
This is what Pliny said.
 

00:25:21.769 --> 00:25:22.318
Right?
 

00:25:22.318 --> 00:25:25.720
But he said he smiled at that,
what a quaint thing to think;

00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:30.730
it's like the occult chemists.
 

00:25:30.730 --> 00:25:35.471
"I think that it has been
of late too much the mode to

00:25:35.471 --> 00:25:38.578
slight the learning of the
ancients.

00:25:38.578 --> 00:25:42.361
The learned,
too, are apt to slight too much

00:25:42.361 --> 00:25:45.000
the knowledge of the vulgar.
 

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:48.646
In 1757, being at sea in a
fleet of ninety-six sail bound

00:25:48.646 --> 00:25:51.838
against Louisbourg,"
(off Cape Breton Island)

00:25:51.838 --> 00:25:55.161
"I observed the wakes of
two of the ships to be

00:25:55.161 --> 00:25:58.210
remarkably smooth,
while all the others were

00:25:58.210 --> 00:26:00.890
ruffled by the wind,
which blew fresh.

00:26:00.890 --> 00:26:03.329
Being puzzled with the
differing appearance,

00:26:03.329 --> 00:26:06.508
I at last pointed it out to our
captain and asked him the

00:26:06.508 --> 00:26:07.528
meaning of it.
 

00:26:07.528 --> 00:26:09.932
'The cooks,' said he,
'have I suppose just been

00:26:09.932 --> 00:26:12.650
emptying their greasy water
through the scuppers,

00:26:12.650 --> 00:26:17.506
which has greased the sides of
those ships a little.'"

00:26:17.506 --> 00:26:22.278
(So there's experimental
evidence for what Pliny said.)

00:26:22.278 --> 00:26:25.519
"Recollecting what I had
formerly read in Pliny,

00:26:25.519 --> 00:26:28.299
I resolved to make some
experiments of the effect of oil

00:26:28.299 --> 00:26:30.930
on water when I should have the
opportunity."

00:26:30.930 --> 00:26:34.950
And when he had the opportunity
was when he was in London.

00:26:34.950 --> 00:26:40.076
So here's London,
and his experiment in 1762 was

00:26:40.076 --> 00:26:44.440
in that place,
on Clapham Common in South

00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:45.640
London.
 

00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:48.684
"At length being at
Clapham, where there is on the

00:26:48.684 --> 00:26:51.730
common a large pond which I
observed one day to be very

00:26:51.730 --> 00:26:54.633
rough with the wind,
I fetched out a cruet of oil

00:26:54.633 --> 00:26:56.818
and dropped a little of it on
the water.

00:26:56.818 --> 00:27:00.256
I saw it spread itself with
surprising swiftness upon the

00:27:00.256 --> 00:27:03.141
surface;
but the effect of smoothing the

00:27:03.141 --> 00:27:05.338
waves was not produced."
 

00:27:05.338 --> 00:27:11.210
(So the experiment was a
failure.)

00:27:11.210 --> 00:27:15.105
"For I had applied it
first on the leeward side of the

00:27:15.105 --> 00:27:17.588
pond where the waves were
greatest;

00:27:17.588 --> 00:27:21.358
and the wind drove my oil back
along the shore."

00:27:21.358 --> 00:27:23.509
So it didn't spread on the
surface.

00:27:23.509 --> 00:27:24.680
So what did he do?
 

00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:26.788
Students:
 Go to the other side.

00:27:26.788 --> 00:27:28.808
Prof: Go the other side,
right?

00:27:28.808 --> 00:27:31.916
"I then went to the
windward side where the waves

00:27:31.916 --> 00:27:36.049
began to form and there the oil,
though not more than a teaspoon

00:27:36.049 --> 00:27:39.012
full,
produced an instant calm over a

00:27:39.012 --> 00:27:43.917
space several yards square which
spread amazingly and extended

00:27:43.917 --> 00:27:47.940
itself gradually till it reached
the lee side,

00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:50.269
making all that quarter of the
pond,

00:27:50.269 --> 00:27:55.942
perhaps half an acre,
as smooth as a looking

00:27:55.942 --> 00:27:57.788
glass."
 

00:27:57.788 --> 00:28:02.019
So a teaspoon is five cubic
centimeters,

00:28:02.019 --> 00:28:08.420
and he stilled half an acre,
which is 2000 square meters,

00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:12.680
which means the thickness of
this layer,

00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:16.750
to spread that many cubic
centimeters over 2000 square

00:28:16.750 --> 00:28:20.540
meters,
would be twenty-five angstroms,

00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:25.707
which is the length of a
molecule of the fat that's in

00:28:25.707 --> 00:28:26.778
the oil.
 

00:28:26.778 --> 00:28:33.067
So Franklin had in fact
measured the length of an oil

00:28:33.067 --> 00:28:35.970
molecule, in this way.
 

00:28:35.970 --> 00:28:38.654
Now he didn't think he had
measured it and didn't claim to

00:28:38.654 --> 00:28:39.548
have measured it.
 

00:28:39.548 --> 00:28:42.550
He said, "When put on the
water it spreads instantly many

00:28:42.550 --> 00:28:45.515
feet around,
becoming so thin as to produce

00:28:45.515 --> 00:28:49.448
the prismatic colours"
(the Newton Ring's colors,

00:28:49.448 --> 00:28:50.190
right?)
 

00:28:50.190 --> 00:28:53.387
"for a considerable space,
and beyond them so much

00:28:53.387 --> 00:28:55.942
thinner"
(it became so thin that you

00:28:55.942 --> 00:28:58.690
didn't even get Newton's colors,
right?)

00:28:58.690 --> 00:29:02.167
"so much thinner as to be
invisible except in its

00:29:02.167 --> 00:29:05.818
effect of smoothing the waves at
much greater distance."

00:29:05.818 --> 00:29:09.288
(So the technique was stilling
the water;

00:29:09.288 --> 00:29:12.220
allowed you to measure how big
the area was.

00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:15.160
Isn't that cool?)
 

00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:18.505
"It seems as if a mutual
repulsion between the particles

00:29:18.505 --> 00:29:21.348
took place as soon as it touched
the water."

00:29:21.348 --> 00:29:23.940
That is, they pressed one
another apart and moved.

00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:27.827
So what he wouldn't have known
was that they pushed one another

00:29:27.827 --> 00:29:31.150
apart but they stayed in contact
with one another,

00:29:31.150 --> 00:29:34.410
to become a monomolecular thick
layer over the water.

00:29:34.410 --> 00:29:39.402
So he didn't claim to have
measured it, but indeed he did

00:29:39.402 --> 00:29:42.788
measure the size of an oil
molecule.

00:29:42.788 --> 00:29:46.113
So molecules are very,
very, very small,

00:29:46.113 --> 00:29:51.310
but they're not inconceivably
small and there are ways you can

00:29:51.310 --> 00:29:52.759
measure them.
 

00:29:52.759 --> 00:29:56.318
So we have this question,
are there electron pairs?

00:29:56.318 --> 00:30:01.747
So let's try first feeling,
with Scanning Probe Microscopy,

00:30:01.747 --> 00:30:02.588
or SPM.
 

00:30:02.588 --> 00:30:05.420
Can we feel individual
molecules?

00:30:05.420 --> 00:30:08.068
Can we feel individual atoms?
 

00:30:08.068 --> 00:30:12.769
Can we see what bonds are by
feeling them?

00:30:12.769 --> 00:30:17.553
So Scanning Tunneling
Microscopy was invented in 1981

00:30:17.553 --> 00:30:21.968
by these guys in Zurich,
Gerd Binnig and Heinrich

00:30:21.968 --> 00:30:22.980
Rohrer.
 

00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:25.420
And here's the first
publication.

00:30:25.420 --> 00:30:29.078
They worked at IBM and here's
the first publication on the

00:30:29.078 --> 00:30:32.416
cover of their journal about a
meeting about this new

00:30:32.416 --> 00:30:35.160
technique,
Scanning Tunneling Microscopy.

00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:37.634
And they got the Nobel Prize
within five years,

00:30:37.634 --> 00:30:43.118
or maybe it was even less;
in very short order, 1986.

00:30:43.118 --> 00:30:47.068
Now how does that Scanning
Tunneling Microscopy,

00:30:47.068 --> 00:30:50.818
which is one type of SPM
scanning probe --

00:30:50.818 --> 00:30:53.390
Scanning Tunneling is one way,
and I'll mention that shortly.

00:30:53.390 --> 00:30:58.068
But first I'm going to talk
about Atomic Force Microscopy.

00:30:58.068 --> 00:31:02.170
And for this you need a little
chip, and I'll show you.

00:31:02.170 --> 00:31:08.619
The chip is in here,
in this little bug box.

00:31:08.619 --> 00:31:09.880
Ah you can't see it here.
 

00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:12.798
Well there's the chip in the
middle, right?

00:31:12.798 --> 00:31:16.288
And I'll pass it around so you
can look at it.

00:31:16.288 --> 00:31:21.662
And if you tilt it so that the
light from the ceiling glints

00:31:21.662 --> 00:31:26.205
off the gold,
and you see it really shining,

00:31:26.205 --> 00:31:32.068
you may be able to see at the
thin end these little v's;

00:31:32.068 --> 00:31:34.118
you can see here at the bottom
little v's.

00:31:34.118 --> 00:31:36.819
The chip is 1.4 millimeters
wide.

00:31:36.819 --> 00:31:39.779
It's a gold-coated silicon chip.
 

00:31:39.779 --> 00:31:43.276
And if you look at those with
even higher magnification you

00:31:43.276 --> 00:31:45.990
see this -- and there's the size
of a hair.

00:31:45.990 --> 00:31:48.338
You can actually see -- did you
see them?

00:31:48.338 --> 00:31:51.223
They're not easy to see and
maybe you will and maybe you

00:31:51.223 --> 00:31:52.640
won't, but they're there.
 

00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:55.608
Okay, so there's the size of a
hair.

00:31:55.608 --> 00:31:59.674
And in any given experiment you
have a choice of five different

00:31:59.674 --> 00:32:03.019
cantilevers, as they're called,
that you can use.

00:32:03.019 --> 00:32:07.067
Here's a higher resolution
electron micrograph that shows

00:32:07.067 --> 00:32:12.516
the tip of one of these v's,
and you see a little bulge

00:32:12.516 --> 00:32:18.845
here, at the bottom,
and if you zoom in on that you

00:32:18.845 --> 00:32:23.210
see this;
it's a little pyramid.

00:32:23.210 --> 00:32:26.864
And so at the bottom of that
pyramid the radius of curvature

00:32:26.864 --> 00:32:30.828
of this tip is only about twenty
nanometers, so about the size of

00:32:30.828 --> 00:32:32.130
twenty molecules.
 

00:32:32.130 --> 00:32:32.670
Right?
 

00:32:32.670 --> 00:32:36.171
It's round on the tip,
it's not truly pointed and come

00:32:36.171 --> 00:32:38.650
to nothing;
it's a little bit rounded.

00:32:38.650 --> 00:32:42.791
You can buy ones that are a
third that size,

00:32:42.791 --> 00:32:45.490
their radius of curvature.
 

00:32:45.490 --> 00:32:48.880
Okay, and then you have this
piece of glass.

00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:55.669
I said, "Do not
touch" when you came in

00:32:55.669 --> 00:33:01.608
because that piece of glass
costs $2000.

00:33:01.608 --> 00:33:05.349
Okay, so there's this piece of
glass, and if I hold it up here

00:33:05.349 --> 00:33:09.029
there's a little chip on the
bottom of the piece of glass.

00:33:09.029 --> 00:33:10.048
I know what I'm looking for.
 

00:33:10.048 --> 00:33:11.970
I don't know if you can see it
or not.

00:33:11.970 --> 00:33:16.660
But anyhow it's held into this
piece of stuff here.

00:33:16.660 --> 00:33:19.076
And those little tips are
pointing up here,

00:33:19.076 --> 00:33:22.700
but in fact the thing is used
upside down so they point down.

00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:25.400
So here's that thing mounted in
an instrument,

00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:28.630
and you see there's a red light
glowing in the glass,

00:33:28.630 --> 00:33:31.848
and the reason is it's being
irradiated by --

00:33:31.848 --> 00:33:35.109
so there's a blown up picture
of one of these tips,

00:33:35.109 --> 00:33:36.769
pointing down.
 

00:33:36.769 --> 00:33:41.279
And laser light comes and
bounces off the shiny gold on

00:33:41.279 --> 00:33:45.288
this tip, and gets reflected up
to a detector.

00:33:45.288 --> 00:33:50.759
Now what would happen if you
pushed up on the tip?

00:33:50.759 --> 00:33:53.440
It would deviate the
reflection, right?

00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:56.970
It would go like this.
 

00:33:56.970 --> 00:34:02.435
And you have a very precise
position detector for the laser

00:34:02.435 --> 00:34:06.490
light up where you see the light
glowing.

00:34:06.490 --> 00:34:12.420
So you can tell the deviation
of that tip, moving up and down,

00:34:12.420 --> 00:34:16.019
by a size that's less than an
atom.

00:34:16.019 --> 00:34:17.889
Isn't that neat?
 

00:34:17.889 --> 00:34:21.869
So now what you do in this is
move this back and forth over

00:34:21.869 --> 00:34:25.918
the sample and watch the little
needle go up and down by the

00:34:25.918 --> 00:34:27.840
reflection of the light.
 

00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:30.932
So if you had,
if the surface was like this,

00:34:30.932 --> 00:34:32.876
they'll click,
click, click,

00:34:32.876 --> 00:34:34.818
click, click,
click, up, up,

00:34:34.818 --> 00:34:37.050
up, and just scan across.
 

00:34:37.050 --> 00:34:39.460
And it's sensitive,
as I say, to less than one

00:34:39.460 --> 00:34:43.090
molecule change in height;
although it doesn't feel an

00:34:43.090 --> 00:34:47.349
individual molecule because the
tip, remember is twenty

00:34:47.349 --> 00:34:48.849
nanometers wide.
 

00:34:48.849 --> 00:34:54.929
So the width of the tip is like
100 or so atoms.

00:34:54.929 --> 00:34:55.670
Right?
 

00:34:55.670 --> 00:34:57.940
So it's touching a bunch of
atoms at any one time.

00:34:57.940 --> 00:35:00.710
But if you come to a ledge,
unlike a crystal ,

00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:02.039
it would be going at a certain
height,

00:35:02.039 --> 00:35:03.704
touching a bunch,
and then it would move up and

00:35:03.704 --> 00:35:06.179
touch a bunch more,
and you'd be able to tell if it

00:35:06.179 --> 00:35:09.657
went up and down,
if that distance was only one

00:35:09.657 --> 00:35:11.010
molecule; easy.
 

00:35:11.010 --> 00:35:13.132
Here's, in fact,
a picture taken by an

00:35:13.132 --> 00:35:14.050
undergraduate.
 

00:35:14.050 --> 00:35:15.739
In fact, it's a movie.
 

00:35:15.739 --> 00:35:17.039
So it's AFM traces.
 

00:35:17.039 --> 00:35:19.353
So what you do,
it's like a TV where you go

00:35:19.353 --> 00:35:21.228
zoom, zoom, zoom,
zoom, zoom, zoom,

00:35:21.228 --> 00:35:22.664
zoom,
zoom, and then you go back to

00:35:22.664 --> 00:35:23.835
the top,
zoom, zoom, zoom,

00:35:23.835 --> 00:35:27.050
zoom, zoom, say how high it is
at every point along the scan,

00:35:27.050 --> 00:35:29.579
and then color code it to show
how high.

00:35:29.579 --> 00:35:33.070
So the width of this is about
600 molecules,

00:35:33.070 --> 00:35:33.719
right?
 

00:35:33.719 --> 00:35:37.527
But the lines you see,
which are ledges that go up and

00:35:37.527 --> 00:35:40.936
down;
each of those ledges is one

00:35:40.936 --> 00:35:46.210
unit cell, 1.7 nanometers,
one set of molecules.

00:35:46.210 --> 00:35:49.849
So these are -- and that,
the thing at the top surface

00:35:49.849 --> 00:35:52.253
where it's flat,
is absolutely flat,

00:35:52.253 --> 00:35:55.139
except for there's little holes
there.

00:35:55.139 --> 00:35:58.864
And those holes were made by
taking this tip and pressing

00:35:58.864 --> 00:36:02.990
down and scratching a little bit
to knock some of the molecules

00:36:02.990 --> 00:36:03.590
away.
 

00:36:03.590 --> 00:36:06.469
So the larger pit is five
nanometers deep,

00:36:06.469 --> 00:36:10.755
which means it's four layers of
molecules that've been knocked

00:36:10.755 --> 00:36:11.949
off in there.
 

00:36:11.949 --> 00:36:15.679
And now this is underwater,
or underwater in propanol.

00:36:15.679 --> 00:36:18.449
So the crystal is dissolving
slowly.

00:36:18.449 --> 00:36:22.949
So those pits open up,
as molecules come away.

00:36:22.949 --> 00:36:26.659
So watch.
 

00:36:26.659 --> 00:36:27.099
Right?
 

00:36:27.099 --> 00:36:29.380
Those are at one-minute
intervals.

00:36:29.380 --> 00:36:34.097
So we're actually feeling
individual molecular heights

00:36:34.097 --> 00:36:35.699
with this thing.
 

00:36:35.699 --> 00:36:39.967
There's an interesting point
here that I'm not going to dwell

00:36:39.967 --> 00:36:43.809
on, but the smallest one did not
lose any molecules.

00:36:43.809 --> 00:36:47.280
If I back up,
watch the smallest one.

00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:50.079
It always stays the same size
as the others dissolve.

00:36:50.079 --> 00:36:52.889
That's an interesting puzzle
isn't it?

00:36:52.889 --> 00:36:55.409
But at any rate, you can do it.
 

00:36:55.409 --> 00:36:59.429
And you can measure the rate at
which different ledges dissolve.

00:36:59.429 --> 00:37:04.210
Some dissolve much faster than
others.

00:37:04.210 --> 00:37:08.050
Here's scanning tunneling
microscopy.

00:37:08.050 --> 00:37:09.340
This is done in a different way.
 

00:37:09.340 --> 00:37:11.510
It's not -- you don't reflect
the laser light.

00:37:11.510 --> 00:37:17.746
What you do is detect the
electrical conductivity through

00:37:17.746 --> 00:37:18.860
a layer.
 

00:37:18.860 --> 00:37:21.942
And if you have an atom there
that is a good conductor of

00:37:21.942 --> 00:37:25.023
electricity, you get more
current through and less and so

00:37:25.023 --> 00:37:25.409
on.
 

00:37:25.409 --> 00:37:28.619
So as you scan a real -- now
this could be a really,

00:37:28.619 --> 00:37:32.460
really sharp tip where the tip
is just one atom or a couple of

00:37:32.460 --> 00:37:33.090
atoms.
 

00:37:33.090 --> 00:37:36.737
So now as you go across you can
feel things that are much

00:37:36.737 --> 00:37:38.039
smaller laterally.
 

00:37:38.039 --> 00:37:38.789
Okay?
 

00:37:38.789 --> 00:37:41.690
So this picture here,
that thing right there,

00:37:41.690 --> 00:37:44.190
which is as you see a repeated
pattern,

00:37:44.190 --> 00:37:47.909
that's one of those molecules,
with 12 carbons and a bromine

00:37:47.909 --> 00:37:48.730
on the end.
 

00:37:48.730 --> 00:37:53.860
And here's a model that shows
what the molecule looks like.

00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:57.744
The yellow is bromine,
the brown are the two oxygens,

00:37:57.744 --> 00:38:01.780
and the green are carbon and
the grey are hydrogens.

00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:05.206
They don't come colored that
way, they come looking like

00:38:05.206 --> 00:38:06.889
this, as to conductivity.
 

00:38:06.889 --> 00:38:09.530
But you can see individual
atoms.

00:38:09.530 --> 00:38:10.190
Right?
 

00:38:10.190 --> 00:38:12.768
Or one of the more dramatic
early examples,

00:38:12.768 --> 00:38:18.489
in 1993, was at the IBM labs at
Almaden in California,

00:38:18.489 --> 00:38:22.840
where they worked on iron atoms
on a surface of copper,

00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:25.916
and they used this tip and
changing the voltage to pick up

00:38:25.916 --> 00:38:28.130
atoms and move them where they
wanted,

00:38:28.130 --> 00:38:30.130
then change the voltage and
drop them there,

00:38:30.130 --> 00:38:31.650
then go back and get another
one and do it.

00:38:31.650 --> 00:38:35.297
So they made this thing they
called a quantum corral of

00:38:35.297 --> 00:38:38.539
whatever, fifty-eight or
something iron atoms.

00:38:38.539 --> 00:38:39.018
Yes?
 

00:38:39.018 --> 00:38:41.771
Student:  Is that along
the lines of when they moved the

00:38:41.771 --> 00:38:43.018
atoms --
Prof: Pardon me?

00:38:43.018 --> 00:38:45.521
Student:  Is this along
the lines of when they moved the

00:38:45.521 --> 00:38:46.530
atoms to spell out IBM?
 

00:38:46.530 --> 00:38:48.860
Prof: Oh yes,
they also spelled out IBM.

00:38:48.860 --> 00:38:52.699
They knew which side their
bread was buttered on too,

00:38:52.699 --> 00:38:55.210
just like the Royal Society
did.

00:38:55.210 --> 00:38:56.449
Okay, so that's neat.
 

00:38:56.449 --> 00:39:01.847
So clearly you can see
individual, or feel individual

00:39:01.847 --> 00:39:05.690
atoms, but you don't see the
bonds.

00:39:05.690 --> 00:39:06.860
The bonds are smaller.
 

00:39:06.860 --> 00:39:09.420
It just looks like a bunch of
balls, right?

00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:12.909
You don't see the electron
pairs between them.

00:39:12.909 --> 00:39:16.820
Here's SNOM.
 

00:39:16.820 --> 00:39:21.789
SNOM stands for Scanning
Near-Field Optical Microscope.

00:39:21.789 --> 00:39:25.699
So this is in a sense seeing,
but actually it's scanning.

00:39:25.699 --> 00:39:27.829
It's like feeling.
 

00:39:27.829 --> 00:39:31.851
So what you have here is a
glass fiber that's drawn down to

00:39:31.851 --> 00:39:35.110
a very sharp point and coated
with aluminum,

00:39:35.110 --> 00:39:38.489
and the hole at the bottom is
just 100 nanometers;

00:39:38.489 --> 00:39:42.018
that's like 100 molecules,
not really, really tiny like

00:39:42.018 --> 00:39:44.369
the scanning tunneling
microscope.

00:39:44.369 --> 00:39:47.086
So what you do is you have
something on the surface of a

00:39:47.086 --> 00:39:49.409
slide here that you want to
probe with this,

00:39:49.409 --> 00:39:53.135
and you send light down the
thing, and if there is a

00:39:53.135 --> 00:39:56.130
molecule where the light's
coming out,

00:39:56.130 --> 00:39:59.389
through this tiny hole,
if there's a molecule there,

00:39:59.389 --> 00:40:03.570
that will take the blue light
and emit red light.

00:40:03.570 --> 00:40:05.829
Then you know when it's under
the tip.

00:40:05.829 --> 00:40:08.260
Suppose there was just one
molecule on the whole slide.

00:40:08.260 --> 00:40:12.190
You scan it around until
suddenly red light comes out.

00:40:12.190 --> 00:40:15.123
Then you know that tip is
pointed toward that particular

00:40:15.123 --> 00:40:15.710
molecule.
 

00:40:15.710 --> 00:40:16.869
Okay?
 

00:40:16.869 --> 00:40:20.219
So red light comes out and you
have a detector that detects it,

00:40:20.219 --> 00:40:23.230
and you scan the sample back
and forth,

00:40:23.230 --> 00:40:27.869
like a TV, and you find out
where such molecules are.

00:40:27.869 --> 00:40:30.219
And here's a picture taken in
that way.

00:40:30.219 --> 00:40:35.900
So this is a scale of microns,
2 x 2 microns;

00:40:35.900 --> 00:40:39.800
in fact it's a distorted scale,
as I see here.

00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:41.070
Okay?
 

00:40:41.070 --> 00:40:43.907
And that arrow,
doubled-headed arrow,

00:40:43.907 --> 00:40:46.510
is the wavelength of red light.
 

00:40:46.510 --> 00:40:49.530
So you're seeing things
significantly smaller than the

00:40:49.530 --> 00:40:52.610
wavelength of the light,
having done it in this way.

00:40:52.610 --> 00:40:57.532
You're not really looking with
your eye, you're doing this

00:40:57.532 --> 00:40:59.000
scanning trick.
 

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:01.170
Okay, so scanning probe
microscopies,

00:41:01.170 --> 00:41:05.469
like atomic force microscopy,
scanning tunneling microscopy,

00:41:05.469 --> 00:41:07.909
scanning near-field optical
microscopy,

00:41:07.909 --> 00:41:11.146
are really powerful,
and you can see individual

00:41:11.146 --> 00:41:11.710
atoms.
 

00:41:11.710 --> 00:41:12.739
Right?
 

00:41:12.739 --> 00:41:17.052
The sharp points can resolve
individual molecules,

00:41:17.052 --> 00:41:19.869
and even atoms,
but not bonds.

00:41:19.869 --> 00:41:24.989
So it's not doing what we need
to do for our purposes.

00:41:24.989 --> 00:41:29.666
Now, that's -- I'm going to
spend the last few minutes going

00:41:29.666 --> 00:41:33.630
over the problem that we were
looking at with --

00:41:33.630 --> 00:41:36.208
remember you were supposed to
draw all the resonance

00:41:36.208 --> 00:41:38.030
structures for H,
C, O, N isomers.

00:41:38.030 --> 00:41:40.239
I think you remember that.
 

00:41:40.239 --> 00:41:41.679
Okay, so let's just look at it.
 

00:41:41.679 --> 00:41:45.579
So what we're going to do is
compare what we see with Lewis

00:41:45.579 --> 00:41:49.414
theory with things that have
been calculated by reasonably

00:41:49.414 --> 00:41:52.375
good quantum mechanics;
not the very,

00:41:52.375 --> 00:41:56.340
very highest level,
but a pretty good level.

00:41:56.340 --> 00:42:03.019
Okay, so we want to try to make
all the possible arrangements

00:42:03.019 --> 00:42:03.800
here.
 

00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:08.335
So we can put the three atoms,
O, C, N, with any one of them

00:42:08.335 --> 00:42:11.795
in the middle,
and then we can put hydrogen on

00:42:11.795 --> 00:42:12.949
either end.
 

00:42:12.949 --> 00:42:15.469
So then we'll do it with
nitrogen in the middle and then

00:42:15.469 --> 00:42:17.670
with oxygen in the middle,
so we'll have done all

00:42:17.670 --> 00:42:18.769
possibilities there.
 

00:42:18.769 --> 00:42:21.050
So here are two possibilities.
 

00:42:21.050 --> 00:42:24.780
Now are these good structures
is what we have to decide?

00:42:24.780 --> 00:42:30.454
Okay, now it would be possible
to shift electrons here and draw

00:42:30.454 --> 00:42:33.199
a different Lewis structure.
 

00:42:33.199 --> 00:42:35.329
Which of those two do you think
is better?

00:42:35.329 --> 00:42:36.239
Student: Probably the
top one.

00:42:36.239 --> 00:42:37.690
Prof: Why?
 

00:42:37.690 --> 00:42:39.360
&lt;&lt;Students speak over one
another&gt;&gt;

00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:41.422
Prof: Okay,
there's separation of charge on

00:42:41.422 --> 00:42:41.969
the bottom.
 

00:42:41.969 --> 00:42:43.719
Okay?
 

00:42:43.719 --> 00:42:46.039
So there's bad charge
separation.

00:42:46.039 --> 00:42:50.581
The most electronegative atom,
oxygen, in fact has a positive

00:42:50.581 --> 00:42:52.929
charge not a negative charge.
 

00:42:52.929 --> 00:42:53.570
Right?
 

00:42:53.570 --> 00:42:57.088
So that's -- not only is there
a charge separation,

00:42:57.088 --> 00:42:59.199
it's in the wrong direction.
 

00:42:59.199 --> 00:43:02.269
But they're all octets that
we've drawn in both structures.

00:43:02.269 --> 00:43:03.440
All atoms have octets.
 

00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:05.820
Now let's try the same trick
over here.

00:43:05.820 --> 00:43:06.940
We can do it that way.
 

00:43:06.940 --> 00:43:08.880
How about that?
 

00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:11.909
Which of those is better?
 

00:43:11.909 --> 00:43:16.235
In both structures we could go
through and count and see that

00:43:16.235 --> 00:43:17.750
they're all octets.
 

00:43:17.750 --> 00:43:21.507
Would you like me to do that,
or is that something that's

00:43:21.507 --> 00:43:23.989
become second nature to you by
now?

00:43:23.989 --> 00:43:25.760
Anybody want me to count them?
 

00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:27.389
Okay, you've got that.
 

00:43:27.389 --> 00:43:29.630
But now which of those two
structures do you think is

00:43:29.630 --> 00:43:30.018
better?
 

00:43:30.018 --> 00:43:34.619
&lt;&lt;Students speak over one
another&gt;&gt;

00:43:34.619 --> 00:43:37.418
Prof: So you say the top
one's better,

00:43:37.418 --> 00:43:40.789
you say, because it doesn't
have charge separation.

00:43:40.789 --> 00:43:44.902
Now, as compared to the case on
the left, which do you think --

00:43:44.902 --> 00:43:48.949
if you have to have charge
separation, which one is better?

00:43:48.949 --> 00:43:49.820
Student:  The right.
 

00:43:49.820 --> 00:43:53.579
Prof: The one on the
right because at least you have

00:43:53.579 --> 00:43:56.949
it with the right atom,
the oxygen being negative.

00:43:56.949 --> 00:44:00.500
You could've drawn the one on
the top too, right?

00:44:00.500 --> 00:44:03.880
And that goes the other way.
 

00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:07.505
Notice that I've introduced
something here that I haven't

00:44:07.505 --> 00:44:11.130
really talked about enough,
the idea of curved arrows.

00:44:11.130 --> 00:44:17.559
Curved arrows show a shift of
electrons, an electron pair.

00:44:17.559 --> 00:44:21.329
What would you draw if you
wanted to show just one electron

00:44:21.329 --> 00:44:24.449
shifting, if you had to think up
the notation?

00:44:24.449 --> 00:44:27.139
Students:
 A dotted curve.

00:44:27.139 --> 00:44:28.889
Prof: A dotted curve
would be one possibility.

00:44:28.889 --> 00:44:29.949
Another possibility?
 

00:44:29.949 --> 00:44:30.820
Sophie?
 

00:44:30.820 --> 00:44:31.780
Student:  Half a head
instead of a full head.

00:44:31.780 --> 00:44:34.856
Prof: Ah,
like a fishhook instead of the

00:44:34.856 --> 00:44:35.860
double arrow.
 

00:44:35.860 --> 00:44:37.889
And that's in fact what's used.
 

00:44:37.889 --> 00:44:41.626
If you want to shift just one
electron you show a single barb,

00:44:41.626 --> 00:44:44.688
and if you do a pair of
electrons you show a double

00:44:44.688 --> 00:44:46.219
barb, a curved arrow.
 

00:44:46.219 --> 00:44:49.550
So curved arrows don't show
atoms moving.

00:44:49.550 --> 00:44:52.460
They don't show this atom goes
to there.

00:44:52.460 --> 00:44:56.137
They show an electron pair
moving, or sometimes a single

00:44:56.137 --> 00:44:59.146
electron moving,
and you can use a double or a

00:44:59.146 --> 00:45:01.420
single barb to show which one.
 

00:45:01.420 --> 00:45:06.090
Okay, so get that straight,
because that's often a problem.

00:45:06.090 --> 00:45:08.733
Okay, so the one on top is much
worse than the one on the

00:45:08.733 --> 00:45:09.159
bottom.
 

00:45:09.159 --> 00:45:12.277
Okay, so there are our
possibilities with C in the

00:45:12.277 --> 00:45:12.849
middle.
 

00:45:12.849 --> 00:45:14.710
Now how about if you put N in
the middle?

00:45:14.710 --> 00:45:17.170
Here are two structures with
octets.

00:45:17.170 --> 00:45:19.836
Now -- oh pardon me,
they don't all have octets,

00:45:19.836 --> 00:45:22.958
that one on the right has a
sestet, because the carbon's

00:45:22.958 --> 00:45:25.597
making two bonds;
so it gets three electrons out

00:45:25.597 --> 00:45:27.744
of those two bonds --
pardon me, it gets two

00:45:27.744 --> 00:45:29.469
electrons out of those two
bonds,

00:45:29.469 --> 00:45:32.110
one from each bond,
that's its share from the

00:45:32.110 --> 00:45:35.219
bookkeeping,
plus an unshared pair.

00:45:35.219 --> 00:45:35.659
Right?
 

00:45:35.659 --> 00:45:38.682
That's only -- what's
associated with it,

00:45:38.682 --> 00:45:42.916
it has only three…
pardon me, I'm saying the wrong

00:45:42.916 --> 00:45:44.050
thing here.
 

00:45:44.050 --> 00:45:46.425
It has four electrons that it
calls its own,

00:45:46.425 --> 00:45:49.688
from a bookkeeping point of
view, one from each bond and two

00:45:49.688 --> 00:45:51.070
in the unshared pair.
 

00:45:51.070 --> 00:45:52.599
So it's not charged.
 

00:45:52.599 --> 00:45:56.396
It came in with four electrons,
it's still got four electrons,

00:45:56.396 --> 00:45:59.760
but participates with only
three pairs of electrons;

00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:00.699
so it's a sestet.
 

00:46:00.699 --> 00:46:02.869
So that's not so good on the
right.

00:46:02.869 --> 00:46:05.728
The one on the left is not so
good because it's

00:46:05.728 --> 00:46:06.909
charge-separated.
 

00:46:06.909 --> 00:46:09.329
At least it's on oxygen,
the negative charge.

00:46:09.329 --> 00:46:11.989
We could draw this other one,
which puts the negative charge

00:46:11.989 --> 00:46:12.530
on carbon.
 

00:46:12.530 --> 00:46:14.340
That's, we would say,
not so good.

00:46:14.340 --> 00:46:15.989
Right?
 

00:46:15.989 --> 00:46:18.690
So that's a bad charge.
 

00:46:18.690 --> 00:46:20.139
Or we could do it that way.
 

00:46:20.139 --> 00:46:22.869
That looks like the best charge
probably;

00:46:22.869 --> 00:46:27.409
better to put positive on
carbon than on nitrogen.

00:46:27.409 --> 00:46:32.699
Okay, but that carbon has a
sestet;

00:46:32.699 --> 00:46:35.219
the others are octet ones.
 

00:46:35.219 --> 00:46:37.409
Okay, we can do this other one
over here.

00:46:37.409 --> 00:46:40.266
Now we've got an octet on the
carbon, but we've got negative

00:46:40.266 --> 00:46:41.380
charge on the carbon.
 

00:46:41.380 --> 00:46:44.469
That's not such a great charge
separation thing.

00:46:44.469 --> 00:46:50.329
Or we can do it this way,
but again we got bad charge.

00:46:50.329 --> 00:46:55.972
Okay, so now if we put O in the
middle we can do these

00:46:55.972 --> 00:47:02.360
structures, both of which you
notice have -- what's bad about

00:47:02.360 --> 00:47:03.320
them?
 

00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:05.750
&lt;&lt;Students speak over one
another&gt;&gt;

00:47:05.750 --> 00:47:09.630
Prof: Sestet there,
sestet on the right too.

00:47:09.630 --> 00:47:13.570
There's a plus charge on oxygen;
that's not so great.

00:47:13.570 --> 00:47:18.170
You can draw curved arrows and
shift the electron pairs around.

00:47:18.170 --> 00:47:21.943
You've now got an octet on
carbon but you got a sestet on

00:47:21.943 --> 00:47:25.110
nitrogen, and bad charge,
negative on carbon;

00:47:25.110 --> 00:47:26.900
not so great.
 

00:47:26.900 --> 00:47:28.469
And over here you could do that.
 

00:47:28.469 --> 00:47:30.610
Sestet again, bad charge.
 

00:47:30.610 --> 00:47:33.621
Or you can make the three heavy
atoms into a ring,

00:47:33.621 --> 00:47:37.000
and then you could put the
hydrogen on any one of the --

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:39.090
coming out of any one of them.
 

00:47:39.090 --> 00:47:43.702
Now the one on the left,
with my computer,

00:47:43.702 --> 00:47:46.289
I can't calculate it.
 

00:47:46.289 --> 00:47:49.190
I can't find an energy minimum
that has that structure.

00:47:49.190 --> 00:47:52.309
So that one is very bad;
which doesn't surprise anyone.

00:47:52.309 --> 00:47:56.121
It's got horrid angles for the
bonds, although we haven't

00:47:56.121 --> 00:47:59.659
really said that we prefer one
angle over another.

00:47:59.659 --> 00:48:03.650
But it also has bad charge
separation.

00:48:03.650 --> 00:48:05.900
Okay?
 

00:48:05.900 --> 00:48:07.130
That one's a bad charge.
 

00:48:07.130 --> 00:48:11.715
So we could draw this other one
here, but it's still got a

00:48:11.715 --> 00:48:14.210
positive on oxygen,
a sestet.

00:48:14.210 --> 00:48:15.510
What do we have here?
 

00:48:15.510 --> 00:48:19.510
A sestet on carbon.
 

00:48:19.510 --> 00:48:26.869
Okay, so here are the bunch of
isomers we've just gone through.

00:48:26.869 --> 00:48:30.012
Now a couple of years ago,
when I first talked about this

00:48:30.012 --> 00:48:32.509
in the class,
and when these things had been

00:48:32.509 --> 00:48:35.333
accurately calc…
or as accurately as people are

00:48:35.333 --> 00:48:38.581
likely to do,
to calculate their true energy

00:48:38.581 --> 00:48:42.347
and structure --
I tested my colleagues in the

00:48:42.347 --> 00:48:45.001
department,
asked them if they could rank

00:48:45.001 --> 00:48:48.123
these things as to what's the
lowest and what's the highest

00:48:48.123 --> 00:48:49.199
energy and so on.
 

00:48:49.199 --> 00:48:53.244
And no one succeeded;
in fact, only a few people get

00:48:53.244 --> 00:48:56.978
the -- know which the lowest one
is, on the basis of their

00:48:56.978 --> 00:48:59.139
familiarity with Lewis theory.
 

00:48:59.139 --> 00:49:03.840
So the point is,
don't be depressed when you are

00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:05.840
trying to do this.
 

00:49:05.840 --> 00:49:08.722
It takes a lot of lore,
and even with all of the lore

00:49:08.722 --> 00:49:10.940
that's been gathered over many
years,

00:49:10.940 --> 00:49:15.036
people can't use Lewis theory
for this purpose because it's

00:49:15.036 --> 00:49:16.518
just not that good.
 

00:49:16.518 --> 00:49:21.423
Okay, but in fact the way I've
drawn them there is their

00:49:21.423 --> 00:49:26.239
energy, according to these
pretty good calculations.

00:49:26.239 --> 00:49:29.974
The very lowest energy is the C
in the middle and H on the

00:49:29.974 --> 00:49:33.710
nitrogen, and then C in the
middle and H on the oxygen.

00:49:33.710 --> 00:49:36.590
Now you can go back and look at
what we said was good and bad

00:49:36.590 --> 00:49:39.521
about these things and convince
yourself that "Ah!

00:49:39.521 --> 00:49:42.498
now you understand why those are
on the bottom and these are on

00:49:42.498 --> 00:49:43.460
the top."
 

00:49:43.460 --> 00:49:46.257
But if it had come out
differently you would have

00:49:46.257 --> 00:49:48.179
convinced yourself differently.
 

00:49:48.179 --> 00:49:49.380
Okay?
 

00:49:49.380 --> 00:49:52.670
So that's enough for today.
 

00:49:52.670 --> 00:49:55.739
Actually, there's a reference
for this if you want to see it.

00:49:55.739 --> 00:49:59.659
The energies were published in
the Journal of Chemical

00:49:59.659 --> 00:50:01.199
Physics in 2004.

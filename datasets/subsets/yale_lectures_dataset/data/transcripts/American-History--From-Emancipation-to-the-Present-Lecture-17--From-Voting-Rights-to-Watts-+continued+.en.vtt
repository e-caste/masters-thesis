00:00:09.567 --> 00:00:13.100
What I'd like to do today
is go back very briefly so

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:17.500
we're all on the same page,
moving from events in 1964

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.867
through 1966 actually.&nbsp;
I'm trying to compress some

00:00:20.867 --> 00:00:24.167
information so we can really
be ready to catch next week

00:00:24.167 --> 00:00:27.967
right where we should
be.&nbsp; Remember in the last

00:00:27.967 --> 00:00:31.800
lecture, I talked about the
events leading up to this

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.000
pivotal summer
of 1964, John F.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.300
Kennedy's assassination,
Lyndon Baines Johnson taking

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.900
up the mantle of
Kennedy's civil rights

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.467
legis--legislation, the
battles over the civil

00:00:42.467 --> 00:00:46.467
rights bill, a bill
being essentially stuck in

00:00:46.467 --> 00:00:50.000
Congress, especially
the Senate filibuster,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.900
student leaders from SNCC
conceptualizing the idea for

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.300
a Freedom Summer, freedom
vote to train people how to

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.500
become--how to fully embrace
their rights as citizens in

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.500
the state of Mississippi,
setting up freedom schools.&nbsp;

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.000
These things all come
together in the summer of

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000
1964.&nbsp; Students from
all around the country,

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.267
Yale included, travel
down to various points in

00:01:16.267 --> 00:01:18.200
Mississippi to begin
Mississippi Freedom

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.800
Democratic--Mississippi,
Mississippi Freedom Summer,

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.100
set up freedom schools, help
organize votes to create a,

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.200
a separate delegation to the
Mississippi Democratic--to

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.200
represent the Mississippi,
Mississippi Democratic Party

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.567
at the Democratic National
Convention in August.&nbsp; And

00:01:36.567 --> 00:01:40.500
the day after Mississippi
Freedom Summer begins,

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.700
three of the
workers, Schwerner,

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.267
Goodman and Chaney,
disappear and are very

00:01:46.267 --> 00:01:52.000
quickly presumed to have
been murdered.&nbsp; During the

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.167
course of the summer, the
Civil Rights Act of '60--the

00:01:54.167 --> 00:01:57.000
Civil Rights Act is
passed, signed into law,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.900
the most comprehensive
law in support of racial

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.400
equality in the nation's
history.&nbsp; There was an

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:10.000
immediate white backlash.&nbsp;
George Wallace declares,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.967
the governor of Alabama,
declares his candidacy.&nbsp;

00:02:13.967 --> 00:02:16.400
Ultimately has strong
showings in Wisconsin,

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.300
Indiana, and Maryland.&nbsp;
Public places in the South

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.400
go private in order to
prevent integration.&nbsp; Civil

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.267
Rights Act had not addressed
the private institutions.&nbsp;

00:02:29.267 --> 00:02:34.467
It's a long summer of riots
in 1964.&nbsp; Riots aren't just

00:02:34.467 --> 00:02:37.700
in southern U.S.&nbsp; In fact,
they're largely urban and

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.600
northern: New York
City; Rochester;

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.567
Paterson, New
Jersey; Elizabeth,

00:02:41.567 --> 00:02:48.700
New Jersey; Philadelphia;
Chicago.&nbsp; It's a time of

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:55.900
trial.&nbsp; And as you'll recall
from my lecture on Monday as

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.000
I was wrapping it up,
weeks before the Democratic

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.567
National
Convention convenes,

00:03:02.567 --> 00:03:04.200
the bodies of Schwerner,
Goodman and Chaney are

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:10.300
found, August 4th.&nbsp; And
they become martyrs of the

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.900
movement, there's no
doubt about it.&nbsp; It's really

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.800
important that you know
that they were found in

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.100
Philadelphia, Mississippi,
for reasons that become very

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.967
important later on in
this course.&nbsp; The bodies are

00:03:19.967 --> 00:03:21.300
found in an earthen
dam in Philadelphia,

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.900
Mississippi.&nbsp; There was
an aspiration to have them

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.800
buried together, but
Mississippi state law said

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.900
the races had to be buried
in separate spaces.&nbsp; David

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:38.900
Dennis, the head of
CORE in Mississippi,

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.067
agrees to give a eulogy
in honor of James Chaney,

00:03:41.067 --> 00:03:42.767
the sole African
American of these,

00:03:42.767 --> 00:03:48.567
of these three people
who were murdered.&nbsp; And he

00:03:48.567 --> 00:03:51.500
agrees to do it and then
he sits down to do it and

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.067
something happens.

00:03:53.067 --> 00:03:58.000
I want to play for
you a clip.&nbsp; It's a

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.500
three-minute-long clip.&nbsp;
It's a little bit longer

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.000
than I normally
like to play,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.100
but you'll actually see the
transformation happen during

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:05.100
the course of the eulogy.

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:09.400
August 7th, 1964.&nbsp; The
funeral of James Chaney in

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:10.400
Meridien, Mississippi.

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:15.100
I feel that he's got his
freedom and we're still

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:16.500
fighting for it.

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:21.700
But what I want to talk
about right now is the

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:26.000
living dead that we have
right among our midst,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.300
not only in the
state of Mississippi,

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.267
but throughout the nation.

00:04:31.267 --> 00:04:34.567
Those are the
people who don't care,

00:04:34.567 --> 00:04:40.267
those who do care but don't
have the guts enough to sign

00:04:40.267 --> 00:04:45.500
up for it, and those
people who are busy up in

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:50.267
Washington and other places
using my freedom and my life

00:04:50.267 --> 00:04:52.167
to play politics with.

00:04:52.167 --> 00:04:56.900
That includes the President
on down to the governor of

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:58.800
the state of Mississippi.

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.100
In my opinion,
as I stand here,

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:07.367
I not only blame the people
who pulled the trigger or

00:05:07.367 --> 00:05:12.100
did the beating or dug
the hole with the shovel,

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:16.867
I bury the people--not bury,
I'm sorry--but I blame the

00:05:16.867 --> 00:05:22.100
people in Washington, D.C.,
and on down in the state of

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:26.367
Mississippi for what
happened just as much as I

00:05:26.367 --> 00:05:29.200
blame those who
pulled the trigger.

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:33.000
You see, I know
what's going to happen.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.267
I feel that even if they
find the people who killed

00:05:38.267 --> 00:05:40.600
those guys in
the summertime,

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:45.867
you got to come back to
the state of Mississippi and

00:05:45.867 --> 00:05:49.200
have a jury, of
all their cousins,

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.100
their aunts, their uncles.

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:54.900
And I know what
they're going to say,

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:59.600
'not guilty' because no one
saw them pull the trigger.

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.500
I'm tired of that.

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:05.300
See, another thing that
makes me even tireder,

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:10.567
though, that is the fact
that we as people here in

00:06:10.567 --> 00:06:14.800
the state and the
country are allowing this to

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:18.600
continue to happen,
even us as black folk.

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:22.467
So I look at the
young kids here,

00:06:22.467 --> 00:06:25.767
that's something else
that I grieve about.

00:06:25.767 --> 00:06:31.000
And little Ben Chaney here
and the other ones like him

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.900
around in this audience.

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:37.667
Well if you want someone
to babysit for your kids,

00:06:37.667 --> 00:06:41.467
hire a black mammy
to hold your baby.

00:06:41.467 --> 00:06:45.267
And as long as
he can do that,

00:06:45.267 --> 00:06:51.400
he can sit down beside me,
he can watch me go up there

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:57.100
and register to vote, and he
can watch me take some type

00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:03.300
of power in this state and
he can sit down as I rule

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:08.067
over him just as he's
ruled over me for years.

00:07:08.067 --> 00:07:10.400
This is our country, too.

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:17.600
We didn't ask to come here;
they brought us over here.

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:18.900
It's cut off at
the last bit there,

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:21.900
but he simply reiterates,
"this is our country too."&nbsp;

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:24.300
Asked about this
eulogy afterwards,

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:26.600
Dave Dennis said he looked
down--he was planning to

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:29.000
abide by the rules and
give sort of a calming and

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.100
reassuring, mournful
and certainly angry,

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:35.167
but in a polite sort of way,
mournful eulogy.&nbsp; And he

00:07:35.167 --> 00:07:37.600
looked down at Ben
Chaney and he just snapped,

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:40.700
"because I can't do this
any longer."&nbsp; What you see

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:44.500
happening in '64 and you'll
see more in '65 as well,

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:47.700
is a fundamental shift in
the tone of the movement.&nbsp;

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:49.700
This is really one of the
most important things to

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:54.367
understand about this moment
in the movement's history.&nbsp;

00:07:54.367 --> 00:07:58.400
You also see in the wake
of great triumphs of the

00:07:58.400 --> 00:07:59.900
movement, like the
Civil Rights Act being

00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:04.400
signed--there's no mistaking
it's a triumph--you also see

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:08.600
a very clear tactical
shift in the movement,

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:10.367
and that's what this
lecture really is about,

00:08:10.367 --> 00:08:13.400
the fundamental tone and
tactical changes in the

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:14.500
movement that
happened in the,

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:18.500
in the '64, '65 moment.&nbsp;
From the standpoint of

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:24.800
tactics, it's clear
to Johnson and to

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:28.200
others--Lyndon Johnson and
to others--that by signing

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:31.800
in the Civil Rights Act,
he was kissing away the

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:33.800
Democratic Party in
the South.&nbsp; This is the,

00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:37.100
this is the real fear.&nbsp; And
the only Democrats who were

00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:40.367
going to vote for him were
African American Democrats.&nbsp;

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:47.467
From the highest levels
of political government,

00:08:47.467 --> 00:08:49.000
organized
government, the notion is,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.167
"you've got to get these
black folks registered."&nbsp;

00:08:52.167 --> 00:08:54.200
Well, as it happened--at
least for the Democratic

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:57.900
Party.&nbsp; On the ground,
that's the agenda as well

00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:00.400
for people in Mississippi,
people who were working on

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:02.600
Mississippi Freedom Summer
and the Mississippi Freedom

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:07.600
Democratic Party.&nbsp;
So the Freedom--MFDP,

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:09.100
Mississippi Freedom
Democratic Party,

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:12.200
an attempt by white
and black activists in

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:14.767
Mississippi, with
support from other places,

00:09:14.767 --> 00:09:17.600
to set up a slate of
candidates to run as the

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:19.800
alternate to the Mississippi
Democratic delegation,

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:22.400
that would
ultimately be seated at the,

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:26.500
at the Democratic National
Convention.&nbsp; The vice chair

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:29.667
of the MFDP, a very famous
activist named Fannie Lou

00:09:29.667 --> 00:09:33.900
Hamer.&nbsp; Fannie Lou Hamer
was the youngest of twenty

00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:38.400
children, sharecropper
all of her life,

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:42.200
no education after
the third grade,

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:48.200
but had powerful presence,
incredibly eloquent,

00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:52.700
captivating
speaker.&nbsp; And sadly,

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:54.800
part of what made her so
captivating is the story she

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:59.500
had to tell was
nightmarish.&nbsp; When I say

00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:01.100
that, you know, she was in
school to the third grade,

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:04.000
the schools were only open
for three or four months,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.300
because the rest of the
time you were working in the

00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:10.400
fields.&nbsp; Well, as other SNCC
activists and SCLC activists

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:14.067
come to, to Mississippi,
they meet this person

00:10:14.067 --> 00:10:18.867
they've been
hearing about, Ms. Hamer,

00:10:18.867 --> 00:10:20.767
and she begins to be
inspired by them and starts

00:10:20.767 --> 00:10:26.767
to try to organize voters on
her own.&nbsp; She's harassed by

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.767
the police.&nbsp; People would
call all day and night on

00:10:32.767 --> 00:10:35.967
her home telephone number
to the point she had to just

00:10:35.967 --> 00:10:38.700
take the phone off the
receiver.&nbsp; Threats with her

00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:41.400
losing her job,
threats against her life,

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:48.000
but she's unfazed.&nbsp;
The Mississippi Freedom

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.600
Democratic Party is
more than just her,

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:57.767
but she embodies so much of
it.&nbsp; As they're marching to

00:10:57.767 --> 00:11:00.300
the Democratic
National Convention,

00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:07.100
the debate is which
Democratic delegation will

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:13.100
the national Democratic
leadership accept?&nbsp; MFDP

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.600
insists that they're
going to be the party to be

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:23.700
recognized.&nbsp; Democratic
established leadership said,

00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:26.567
"That's just not going
to happen."&nbsp; Southern

00:11:26.567 --> 00:11:31.967
delegations in other states
threaten to walk if Lyndon

00:11:31.967 --> 00:11:36.167
Johnson, Democratic National
Committee admit or--yeah,

00:11:36.167 --> 00:11:41.567
admit--MFDP to the floor of
the convention.&nbsp; Johnson's

00:11:41.567 --> 00:11:43.300
already afraid of losing
the South and now this is

00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:46.100
confirmation.&nbsp; And these
were states that are already

00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:48.067
leaning towards
Barry Goldwater anyway,

00:11:48.067 --> 00:11:53.900
the Republican
candidate.&nbsp; Anyway,

00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:57.700
the convention arrives and
Fannie Lou Hamer goes to the

00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:00.600
credentials committee,
representing the MFDP,

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:04.000
and starts to talk with them
about why the MFDP needs to

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.600
be recognized as the proper
delegation.&nbsp; This is the

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:11.300
committee that's setting the
rules for the conference,

00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:14.800
for the convention.&nbsp; And
her statement is captured on

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:18.500
live TV.&nbsp; This is
when you'd have what,

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:19.667
what is it
called?&nbsp; Gavel-to-gavel

00:12:19.667 --> 00:12:23.300
cover--coverage of
conventions and such.&nbsp; And

00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:26.400
she starts telling a
story about her efforts to

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:29.700
organize people to exercise
their full civil rights just

00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:32.567
to vote, get them
to register to vote,

00:12:32.567 --> 00:12:35.267
and being
arrested by the police,

00:12:35.267 --> 00:12:39.567
being taken to jail.&nbsp; And
while she's in jail for

00:12:39.567 --> 00:12:43.500
breaking no law, they
put--the jailors stand by

00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:48.200
and get two black inmates,
bring them over and threaten

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:50.767
them with further punishment
if they did not beat Fannie

00:12:50.767 --> 00:12:56.300
Lou Hamer, and they beat her
senseless.&nbsp; She survives the

00:12:56.300 --> 00:13:01.467
beating, she survives
it, but is physically,

00:13:01.467 --> 00:13:09.267
permanently damaged from the
beating.&nbsp; This is what being

00:13:09.267 --> 00:13:15.300
a citizen meant if you're an
African American activist in

00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:18.200
Mississippi.&nbsp; You could
end up like James Chaney,

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:21.600
could be beaten to an inch
of your life like Fannie Lou

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:26.800
Hamer, certainly sending
signals to the rest of black

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:31.467
Mississippians.&nbsp; Well,
while Hamer is giving this

00:13:31.467 --> 00:13:33.700
testimony to the
credentials committee,

00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:34.867
Lyndon Johnson,
still in Washington,

00:13:34.867 --> 00:13:38.867
D.C., at the White
House, hears about it,

00:13:38.867 --> 00:13:41.200
knows it's going out
live and is furious,

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:43.700
and immediately
calls a press conference

00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:46.400
trying--[student sneezes]
Bless you--trying to simply

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:49.800
distract the media from
what's now airing over the

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:54.000
country.&nbsp; Just a trumped-up
news conference.&nbsp; He had

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.700
nothing to actually talk
about.&nbsp; A lot of the cameras

00:13:56.700 --> 00:14:00.967
stay with Hamer, but Johnson
recognizes that he's losing

00:14:00.967 --> 00:14:05.100
grip of retaining any, any
hope of keeping the white

00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:09.400
South.&nbsp; He asks
his vice president,

00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:11.900
Hubert Humphrey, to get
Walter Mondale to coordinate

00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:15.500
this, a
resolution to a dispute,

00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:18.967
and the resolution says that
the Mississippi--Mississippi

00:14:18.967 --> 00:14:21.100
delegation, the
Democratic delegation,

00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:23.500
Democratic Party would
be seated if they swore

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:26.200
allegiance to Johnson's
civil rights platform.&nbsp;

00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:33.967
But--And in
addition to that,

00:14:33.967 --> 00:14:35.400
two delegates from
the Mississippi Freedom

00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:37.900
Democratic Party would
also join the Mississippi

00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:43.500
Democratic delegation.&nbsp; All
but three of the Mississippi

00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:46.500
Democratic Party delegates,
the "formally" elected

00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:48.200
delegates--this
is an all-white,

00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:49.500
all-white party
in Mississippi,

00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:52.200
I should have said in the
beginning--all but three of

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:54.200
the Mississippi
delegates bolt,

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:58.900
and the MFDP refuses to
compromise.&nbsp; "You either

00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:03.500
seat all of us or none of
us."&nbsp; The Democratic Party

00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:05.867
National Convention
ultimately recognizes just

00:15:05.867 --> 00:15:07.400
three of the delegates
from Mississippi who didn't

00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:10.100
leave.&nbsp; The rest of the
Mississippi delegation votes

00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:14.200
for Barry
Goldwater.&nbsp; The MF--the,

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:17.200
the Mississippi Freedom
Democratic Party delegates

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:18.800
ultimately vote for LBJ.

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:20.500
There's no logical
choice, frankly,

00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:23.000
between LBJ or Goldwater,
as far as their actions were

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:28.300
concerned.&nbsp;
Johnson, of course,

00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:30.567
goes ahead and
gets re-elected,

00:15:30.567 --> 00:15:32.400
or gets elected, I guess,
for the first time in a

00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:38.167
landslide, but he loses five
states in his native South.&nbsp;

00:15:38.167 --> 00:15:40.767
The states that were
threatening to bolt if he

00:15:40.767 --> 00:15:45.867
caved in to the MFDP came
through.&nbsp; He might have lost

00:15:45.867 --> 00:15:48.700
them anyway, but
it becomes very,

00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:50.200
very clear to
Johnson at this point,

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:54.367
to any Democratic activist,
that the black vote is now

00:15:54.367 --> 00:15:56.667
critical in the South, if
there's any hope to hang

00:15:56.667 --> 00:16:02.667
onto a Democratic presence.&nbsp;
So this is the end of the

00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:11.700
summer in 1964.&nbsp; Civil
Rights Act is there,

00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:14.800
but the question of the vote
is unresolved.&nbsp; Civil Rights

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:18.867
Act does not address
voting.&nbsp; Right away,

00:16:18.867 --> 00:16:21.300
activists on the ground and
those at the highest reaches

00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:25.000
of the federal government,
Democratic Party at least,

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.967
hone in on voting.&nbsp;
This is the next,

00:16:27.967 --> 00:16:31.200
this is the next
challenge.&nbsp; Meanwhile,

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:34.400
Martin Luther King is
awarded the Nobel Peace

00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:36.567
Prize.&nbsp; He goes to
Oslo to receive it,

00:16:36.567 --> 00:16:42.167
and he returns in January of
'65 to participate in this

00:16:42.167 --> 00:16:47.100
next wave of challenges, the
vote.&nbsp; He goes--In January

00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:49.900
of '65 he goes to
Selma, Alabama,

00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:52.900
Dallas County,
Selma, Alabama,

00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:55.800
and he announces a new
SCLC initiative to register

00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:59.500
people to vote.&nbsp; The
sheriff in the county,

00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:04.400
a guy named James
Clark, was much like--oh my

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:11.200
goodness--our favorite
punch--punching bag from

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:12.200
Birmingham.

00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:14.000
Bull Connor.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.200
Ah, you guys were paying
attention.&nbsp; Thank you,

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:17.967
Bull Connor--much like
Bull Connor.&nbsp; So he's,

00:17:17.967 --> 00:17:20.100
he's pulling
out cattle prods,

00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:24.767
clubs and tear gas to break
up crowds.&nbsp; I mean he is

00:17:24.767 --> 00:17:28.667
ripe for becoming a target
of national media coverage.&nbsp;

00:17:28.667 --> 00:17:32.200
The situation in
Selma is really quite

00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:36.200
astonishing--in,
in Dallas County,

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:40.800
I should say, not
Selma.&nbsp; The larger district.

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:44.067
In Dallas County, out of
fifteen thousand people who

00:17:44.067 --> 00:17:47.700
are registered to vote,
only three hundred and

00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:49.600
thirty-five of them are
black.&nbsp; Now if you don't

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:52.400
know Alabama, it's
important to understand,

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:54.400
it is a state
with, in many places,

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:56.000
a majority black population,
and in all places,

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.000
a significant black
population.&nbsp; So in Dallas

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.467
County, there is no
black voting presence.

00:18:02.467 --> 00:18:04.467
In Alabama in general,
seventy-seven percent,

00:18:04.467 --> 00:18:06.067
over three quarters
of eligible blacks,

00:18:06.067 --> 00:18:10.300
are still off the voting
rolls.&nbsp; It's a much higher

00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:12.700
percentage than what
you see in other places,

00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:17.767
other southern--throughout
the South in general.&nbsp; So

00:18:17.767 --> 00:18:19.867
King goes down there
to announce a new voter

00:18:19.867 --> 00:18:24.100
registration drive, knowing
that the sheriff would be

00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:28.067
one he could bait
pretty easily.&nbsp; Rallies are

00:18:28.067 --> 00:18:32.200
organized, marches
are planned.&nbsp; Middle of

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:35.367
February, peaceful SCLC
rally in a neighboring,

00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:43.200
neighboring area was
attacked by the police.&nbsp; The

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:46.300
city police, the county
police and the state police.

00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:51.700
And during the melee, one of
the people involved in the

00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:55.900
rally, a twenty-six-year-old
named Jimmie Lee Jackson,

00:18:55.900 --> 00:19:01.100
according to witnesses,
shields his mother who's in

00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:03.100
the process of getting
beaten by a state trooper,

00:19:05.067 --> 00:19:08.567
and he's shot in the stomach
and dies.&nbsp; Now the police

00:19:08.567 --> 00:19:09.900
account of what
happened is different,

00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:12.500
as one would expect, but
the fact of the matter is,

00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:14.600
he's shot in the
stomach, and he dies.&nbsp;

00:19:17.567 --> 00:19:21.200
Guaranteeing--I mean this
would be horrible enough as

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:24.967
it is, and one would
hope gather attention,

00:19:24.967 --> 00:19:27.400
but what guaranteed
gathering the attention to

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:31.667
this fact is that
news cameras were there.

00:19:31.667 --> 00:19:35.100
And in the, in the confusion
of the rally being broken up

00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:38.200
by the police, several
reporters from NBC are

00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:40.367
injured.&nbsp;
Essentially attacked,

00:19:40.367 --> 00:19:42.767
hit--they get beaten up
by the police as well.&nbsp;

00:19:45.067 --> 00:19:50.700
Guarantees national
coverage.&nbsp; A plan evolves

00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:54.200
immediately to
march from Selma,

00:19:57.600 --> 00:19:59.100
where Jimmie Lee
Jackson was murdered,

00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:00.967
from Selma to Montgomery,
the state capital,

00:20:00.967 --> 00:20:05.100
fifty miles away.&nbsp; The
original plan was to take

00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:11.700
Jimmie Lee's body along this
path and leave him at the

00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:14.200
state house stairs.&nbsp;
And, very quickly,

00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:16.567
saner heads prevail.&nbsp;
This is disrespectful to the

00:20:16.567 --> 00:20:22.000
body, of course.&nbsp; But the
fact is the plan for a march

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:29.100
from Selma to Montgomery
is hatched.&nbsp; On March 7th,

00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:36.900
the chairman of the Student
Nonviolent Coordinating

00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:41.767
Committee, John
Lewis, begins a march

00:20:41.767 --> 00:20:46.000
across--begins the march
from Selma to Montgomery.&nbsp;

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:47.900
He's leading in
single file order,

00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:52.300
maybe two or three across,
six hundred protesters over

00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:55.500
the Edmund Pettus Bridge.&nbsp;
It's very important to know

00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:58.167
that Martin Luther
King was not there,

00:20:58.167 --> 00:21:04.167
even though he knows about
the plans.&nbsp; This is the

00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:07.400
march.

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:13.400
Waiting on the other side
were Alabama state troopers,

00:21:19.167 --> 00:21:25.167
under orders from
Governor Wallace to stop the

00:21:30.067 --> 00:21:31.400
marchers.

00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:37.400
Oh, I hit it a second too
late.&nbsp; You can see right

00:21:43.467 --> 00:21:45.767
here in the fading
out, that's John Lewis,

00:21:45.767 --> 00:21:47.500
now
Representative John Lewis,

00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:48.700
in the tan trench coat.

00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:54.700
Clark's posse was
on the sideline.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:07.000
It will be detrimental to
your safety to continue this

00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:27.500
march and I'm saying
that this is an unlawful

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:46.000
assembly.&nbsp; You are to
disperse.&nbsp; You are ordered

00:22:56.467 --> 00:23:02.467
to disperse.&nbsp; Go home or go
to your church.&nbsp; This march

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:25.000
will not continue.&nbsp;
Is that clear to you?

00:23:35.467 --> 00:23:41.467
I've got nothing
further to say to you...

00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:59.367
Tear gas canisters.

00:23:59.367 --> 00:24:01.000
The march, the
disruption of the march,

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.967
is captured on
live TV, of course,

00:24:02.967 --> 00:24:06.400
and shown across the nation,
leading people to ask the

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:08.867
same question that Fannie
Lou Hamer asked when she was

00:24:08.867 --> 00:24:11.700
giving her testimony to the
credentials committee: "is

00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:19.100
this America?"&nbsp; Thousands
flocked to Selma as a

00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:23.100
protest was announced,
"We will march again" from

00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:24.767
across the
country, black, white,

00:24:24.767 --> 00:24:28.300
doesn't matter.&nbsp; They all
come to Selma to right this

00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:32.800
injustice.&nbsp; This day becomes
known as "Bloody Sunday."&nbsp;

00:24:35.167 --> 00:24:36.600
Two days later,
King is there,

00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:41.400
and they're going to march a
second time.&nbsp; And this is a

00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:45.000
pattern that has grown to
become quite irritating to a

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.167
lot of activists
on the ground,

00:24:47.167 --> 00:24:49.267
is that King, for all of
his incredible charisma and

00:24:49.267 --> 00:24:52.800
power, is never
right--really quite there at

00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:55.967
the moment of crisis.&nbsp;
His presence creates a new

00:24:55.967 --> 00:24:59.400
moment of crisis,
no doubt about it,

00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:01.400
but he wasn't there getting
beaten on Bloody Sunday.&nbsp;

00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:06.500
And this is a tension
that has been there in the

00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:09.700
movement for years already,
that when King arrives,

00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:11.067
the cameras show
up; when he leaves,

00:25:11.067 --> 00:25:12.700
the cameras
leave.&nbsp; In this case,

00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:16.567
the cameras were already
there.&nbsp; There's a federal

00:25:16.567 --> 00:25:20.800
order banning the march,
wanting a cool-down period.&nbsp;

00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:24.067
King goes, "We're going to
have a march anyway."&nbsp; A

00:25:24.067 --> 00:25:27.167
bold statement.&nbsp;
So on Tuesday,

00:25:27.167 --> 00:25:34.667
March 9th, King leads a much
larger group of activists

00:25:34.667 --> 00:25:39.367
across the Edmund Pettus
Bridge and starts the march

00:25:39.367 --> 00:25:44.200
to Montgomery.&nbsp; This is not
the famous march though.&nbsp;

00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:47.700
Crosses the bridge, the
police are there like they

00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:51.700
were the last time.&nbsp; They
tell him to turn around,

00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:56.467
the same script.&nbsp; "Go
back to your churches" and

00:25:56.467 --> 00:26:01.300
whatnot.&nbsp; King asks, asks
his followers to kneel and

00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:05.000
pray along with
him and then,

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:09.900
in a complete shock to those
SNCC leaders who are still

00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:12.667
beaten and bloody
from two days earlier,

00:26:12.667 --> 00:26:16.600
King tells them to go back
to their churches.&nbsp; This is

00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:18.067
not what they had bargained
for.&nbsp; They were going to

00:26:18.067 --> 00:26:21.900
press forward and do
this all over again.&nbsp; More

00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:25.900
horrified to discover that
King had negotiated--to keep

00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:28.767
the peace and
respect the federal order,

00:26:28.767 --> 00:26:33.600
King had quietly negotiated
this whole performance,

00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:36.800
so the police knew that if
King stuck to his script,

00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:39.900
he would kneel and
tell his flock to pray,

00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:42.000
you know, create
the visual moment,

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:45.500
and then disperse
peacefully.&nbsp; SNCC leaders

00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:47.767
had no idea about this.&nbsp;
They--so King came in and

00:26:47.767 --> 00:26:50.267
took their
march, hijacked it,

00:26:50.267 --> 00:26:52.667
turned it into his circus,
and then they didn't even

00:26:52.667 --> 00:26:55.600
get to press forward to
honor Jimmie Lee Jackson's

00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:59.367
life.&nbsp; This is a very
important moment in the

00:26:59.367 --> 00:27:03.200
movement.&nbsp; Not one that
is--it's not triumphed as

00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:05.200
the march, the eventual
march to Montgomery that

00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:10.000
happens two weeks later,
under incredible federal

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:17.900
protection by the way.&nbsp; The
slight cracks and fractures

00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:19.867
and fissures that were
there between SNCC and

00:27:19.867 --> 00:27:23.100
SCLC--remember SNCC
being organized under SCLC's

00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:29.000
umbrella just five years
ago at that point--the,

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:33.067
the cracks are now wide
open.&nbsp; And SNCC would no

00:27:33.067 --> 00:27:38.167
longer see itself as being
part of SCLC's organizing

00:27:38.167 --> 00:27:42.600
logic.&nbsp; And SNCC would no
longer kowtow to King's

00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:46.600
declarations.&nbsp; They are
truly--it is truly its own

00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:49.100
organization, and
as we'll soon see,

00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:54.000
takes off on its own path.&nbsp;
So the march does proceed

00:27:54.000 --> 00:28:00.800
in--on the
21st.&nbsp; What's that,

00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:06.000
forty-five years ago and
a, and a few days.&nbsp; But the

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.600
real drama in many ways,
for the movement's sake,

00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:10.700
is the drama that happens
in the two attempts prior to

00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:16.700
that.&nbsp; So the issue is
voting registration.&nbsp; This

00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:22.100
is what these rallies were
about that where Jimmie Lee

00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:24.700
Jackson had been murdered.&nbsp;
This is what the vote to

00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:27.800
Montgomery is, is all about
recognizing the fact that

00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:29.667
African Americans still
don't have access to the

00:28:29.667 --> 00:28:37.600
ballot box.&nbsp; Meanwhile,
a voting rights bill is

00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:43.667
bouncing around Congress,
and Lyndon Johnson keeps

00:28:43.667 --> 00:28:48.800
upping the stakes, and, and
in many ways throwing his

00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:54.700
presidency in harm's way.&nbsp;
He declares between the

00:28:54.700 --> 00:29:01.467
Tuesday turnaround march
and the eventual march,

00:29:01.467 --> 00:29:04.200
he goes to joint session
of Congress and astonishes

00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:08.400
Congress by quoting one
of the famous lines of the

00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:10.000
movement.&nbsp; He
says, you know,

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:11.900
he's basically
saying, "As a nation,

00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:16.100
we cannot abide by treating
our own citizens this way.&nbsp;

00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:20.100
Their struggle is our
struggle and we shall

00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:23.200
overcome."&nbsp; It's an
astonishing moment,

00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:25.700
presidential rhetoric,
Lyndon Johnson saying it.

00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:30.800
&nbsp;In June of the
same year, '65,

00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:32.800
at Howard University's
graduate--graduation

00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:37.800
ceremony, Howard
being the most important,

00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:41.600
largest historically black
college and university,

00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:46.100
essentially mostly funded
by the federal government,

00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:48.400
Johnson at the graduation
ceremony says the following:

00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:53.400
"You do not--[coughs] excuse
me--You do not wipe away the

00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:55.800
scars of
centuries by saying,

00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:57.800
'Now you are free to
go where you want,

00:29:57.800 --> 00:30:02.000
do as you desire, and choose
the leaders you please.' You

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:03.567
do not take a man
who, for years,

00:30:03.567 --> 00:30:07.300
has been hobbled by
chains, liberate him,

00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:09.500
bring him up to the starting
line of a race saying,

00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:12.100
'You are free to
compete with all the others,

00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:15.600
 and still believe that you
have been completely fair.

00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:18.367
This is the next and the
more profound stage of the

00:30:18.367 --> 00:30:19.967
battle for civil rights.

00:30:19.967 --> 00:30:23.400
We seek not just
freedom, but opportunity;

00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:27.700
not just legal
equity, but human ability;

00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:30.767
not just equality as
a right and a theory,

00:30:30.767 --> 00:30:34.267
but equality as a
fact and as a result."

00:30:34.267 --> 00:30:37.600
This is part of LBJ rolling
out affirmative action,

00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:43.600
sort of testing the waters
essentially.&nbsp; But very

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.567
quickly, affirmative action
policies now become woven

00:30:48.567 --> 00:30:54.500
into federal
policies as well.&nbsp; In fact,

00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:56.400
women who have been the
greatest beneficiaries of

00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:58.800
affirmative action,
something I'll probably say

00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:00.900
again in about
three or four weeks,

00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:03.267
were not covered under
the original umbrella of

00:31:03.267 --> 00:31:05.200
affirmative action.&nbsp; It
was actually only added two

00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:07.267
years later and added by
someone who was hostile to

00:31:07.267 --> 00:31:09.100
the whole idea.&nbsp; He
thought, "My god,

00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:10.167
if we just add
women to this thing,

00:31:10.167 --> 00:31:11.700
we'll sink the
whole program,

00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:14.400
 and people went along
with it.&nbsp; He's like,

00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:17.900
"Oh, I misjudged
that one."&nbsp;Anyway,

00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:20.300
back to the summer of '65,
Johnson is going out on a

00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:23.567
limb, essentially, making
clear he is going to be the

00:31:23.567 --> 00:31:25.700
civil rights presidency;
now he's a president,

00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:27.100
president, and many
other things as well,

00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:31.167
but he's definitely the
civil rights president.&nbsp; On

00:31:31.167 --> 00:31:35.400
August 6th of 1965, he
signs the Voting Rights Act,

00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:39.467
an incredible effort to get
it through.&nbsp; And the Voting

00:31:39.467 --> 00:31:42.500
Rights Act prohibited states
from imposing literacy

00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:47.000
requirements as obstacles
for accessing the ballot

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.000
box.&nbsp; It's the most
successful way of cutting

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:52.000
out the vote.&nbsp; And,
most importantly,

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:53.867
and this is the most
important element,

00:31:53.867 --> 00:31:56.800
it allowed the attorney
general to send federal

00:31:56.800 --> 00:32:00.700
examiners in, into any
election where they thought

00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:05.300
voting rights might be
curtailed.&nbsp;The Voting Rights

00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:08.600
Act, just to make clear--and
some of you may get--I mean

00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:12.000
I get, I get this
email about once a year,

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.700
or once every other year,
that the Voting Rights Act

00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:17.200
is coming up before Congress
and it's going--they might

00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:20.200
not approve it, and they'll
end the right to vote for

00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:22.800
African Americans.&nbsp; My
father sent it to me once,

00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:23.800
which drove me
crazy.&nbsp; I'm like,

00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:25.800
"Dad, you know better
than this."&nbsp; The fact is,

00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:27.800
the Voting Rights Act does
not give anybody the right

00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:30.700
to vote.&nbsp; It gives the
federal government the

00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:36.900
authority to protect the
right to vote.&nbsp; It brings

00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:41.300
into bold relief the federal
government's ability and

00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:44.100
right to supersede
in local affairs,

00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:45.900
which has been
the, the nut of the,

00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:49.200
the bone of contention since
the Voting Rights Act was

00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:54.900
passed.&nbsp; The
Voting Rights Act has,

00:32:54.900 --> 00:32:57.667
if you look forward from
the moment of its passage in

00:32:57.667 --> 00:33:02.867
August '65, makes a clear
change.&nbsp; Within four years

00:33:02.867 --> 00:33:07.300
of its passage, three-fifths
of adult blacks are

00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:13.200
registered to vote.&nbsp; It's an
astonishing shift.&nbsp; Between

00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:15.667
1964 and '69, roughly the
same period we're talking

00:33:15.667 --> 00:33:18.267
about here, the number of
registered black voters goes

00:33:18.267 --> 00:33:21.300
from, in Alabama, less
than twenty percent of the

00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:25.300
population to over sixty
percent of the population.

00:33:25.300 --> 00:33:27.700
In Mississippi, it goes to
less than seven percent of

00:33:27.700 --> 00:33:30.800
the population to
over two-thirds of the

00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:35.200
population, within five
years.&nbsp; It's a seismic

00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:37.500
shift, especially when you
consider the number--the

00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:39.200
numbers we're talking about
in terms of the African

00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:42.000
American population.&nbsp; So
there's no disputing the

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:43.567
fact the Voting
Rights Act has a,

00:33:43.567 --> 00:33:48.000
a, a significant
effect, as you look forward,

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:49.300
the crystal
ball, three or four,

00:33:49.300 --> 00:33:51.367
five years from the moment
of its signing.&nbsp; It's also

00:33:51.367 --> 00:33:58.967
clear the Voting Rights Act
had astonishingly no effect

00:33:58.967 --> 00:34:02.700
in the immediate moment, in
those places where blacks

00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:04.100
already had the
right to vote.

00:34:04.100 --> 00:34:05.967
And this was
made very clear,

00:34:05.967 --> 00:34:09.667
five days later, when
the Watts community in Los

00:34:09.667 --> 00:34:15.667
Angeles goes up in flames.&nbsp;
A few words about Watts.&nbsp;

00:34:20.700 --> 00:34:23.900
It's a riot in the, if you
know Los Angeles demography,

00:34:23.900 --> 00:34:27.400
in a portion of the city
that is due south of central

00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:30.767
Los Angeles, a place that
had been the home for the

00:34:30.767 --> 00:34:33.300
longest, for, for a couple
of decades in the wake of

00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:36.100
the Second Great
Migration, World War II,

00:34:36.100 --> 00:34:40.400
where black Los Angeles was
overwhelmingly found.&nbsp; It

00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:43.800
was not a wealthy
part of the city,

00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:49.467
not by any stretch.&nbsp; But
people had the kinds of

00:34:49.467 --> 00:34:51.667
civil rights, citizenship
rights they wouldn't have

00:34:51.667 --> 00:34:53.800
had, African Americans,
they wouldn't have had in

00:34:53.800 --> 00:35:01.000
Mississippi or Alabama or
Georgia.&nbsp; They also had,

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.567
visually, a better quality
of life than those people

00:35:03.567 --> 00:35:06.667
who are stuck in high-rise
slums in Chicago and New

00:35:06.667 --> 00:35:12.000
York City.&nbsp; There's
green spaces.&nbsp; There's,

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.500
well maybe
they're not homeowners,

00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:17.367
but their homes, were living
in homes.&nbsp; They aren't in

00:35:17.367 --> 00:35:19.800
high-rises, certainly.&nbsp;
There's sunshine,

00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:22.200
for goodness' sakes,
there's palm trees.

00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:24.200
But the fact is, there
is incredible economic

00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:28.400
degradation, powerful
sense of hopelessness,

00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:30.500
and a real feeling that
you were not a citizen,

00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:32.000
even though you could, could
vote.&nbsp; But it really had no

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:38.800
great benefit to
you.&nbsp; So in Watts,

00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:42.400
the flashpoint revolves
around an arrest that goes

00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:46.600
bad.&nbsp; Marquette Frye, an
African American man living

00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:49.100
in that neighborhood, is
stopped by the California

00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:52.100
Highway Patrol at night.&nbsp;
He'd been drinking with his

00:35:52.100 --> 00:35:55.200
older brother.&nbsp; Cops pulled
him over and they're about

00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:59.300
to let him go, when
another--this is Marquette

00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:02.000
Frye's version--when another
more belligerent crew of

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:06.167
California Highway Patrol
officers arrive.&nbsp; Frye's

00:36:06.167 --> 00:36:09.100
mother arrives, wanting
to know what's going on,

00:36:09.100 --> 00:36:13.800
trying to get her son.&nbsp; And
these new belligerent cops

00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:18.167
assault the mother.&nbsp; Frye is
hit by a police officer as

00:36:18.167 --> 00:36:19.700
he is trying to
protect his mother,

00:36:19.700 --> 00:36:24.600
thrown into a police
car, sent off.&nbsp; The police

00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:27.600
version is rather
different.&nbsp; Drunken driver,

00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:32.600
they pull Frye over,
radio for assistance.

00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:34.400
Other police arrive.

00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:39.367
Meanwhile, a crowd arrives
of citizens and residents of

00:36:39.367 --> 00:36:44.300
the area.&nbsp; Marquette Frye
makes a play for one of the

00:36:44.300 --> 00:36:48.800
police officers' guns, and
they start wrestling with

00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:50.567
him, throw him
in a car.&nbsp; And,

00:36:50.567 --> 00:36:52.700
immediately, the crowd
that's gathered around,

00:36:52.700 --> 00:36:56.300
a crowd that had been worn
out by police brutality,

00:36:56.300 --> 00:36:58.400
historic police
brutality in that area,

00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:04.400
city, the crowd starts to
explode.&nbsp; What happens,

00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:12.300
ultimately, is that
thirty-four people die the

00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:15.100
next handful of days.&nbsp;
Over a thousand people are

00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:17.700
injured; four
thousand are arrested;

00:37:20.067 --> 00:37:21.900
property damage in excess
of two hundred million,

00:37:21.900 --> 00:37:25.800
which was a ton of money in
1965 if you think about it;

00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:28.200
damage ranging
across a forty-six mile,

00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:31.567
square mile area,
larger than Manhattan or San

00:37:31.567 --> 00:37:35.800
Francisco.&nbsp; Thirty-five
thousand adults are deemed,

00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:40.800
quote, active rioters.&nbsp;
Seventy-two thousand are

00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:44.000
deemed close
spectators.&nbsp; And what,

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.600
why this is important in the
reports that follow is that

00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:49.000
the police are going in
intermittently.&nbsp; It's just

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:52.067
one big logistics mess.&nbsp;
Police are going in now and

00:37:52.067 --> 00:37:54.900
again to try to calm things
down.&nbsp; The riot would be

00:37:54.900 --> 00:37:57.000
sporadic.&nbsp; There'd be
a hot point over here,

00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:58.400
a fire would be
started over there,

00:37:58.400 --> 00:37:59.800
or a fake fire
alarm would be called,

00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:01.900
and police would go over
there.&nbsp; The fire department

00:38:01.900 --> 00:38:04.900
would be called to
a scene and then,

00:38:04.900 --> 00:38:07.700
and then they'd be showered
with bottles and bricks and

00:38:07.700 --> 00:38:13.700
then snipers.&nbsp; It was an
urban battle zone.&nbsp; So a lot

00:38:16.900 --> 00:38:18.767
of people were active
as rioters who never,

00:38:18.767 --> 00:38:21.000
you know, see justice,
according to the police,

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.167
because they're the ones
shooting from windows the

00:38:23.167 --> 00:38:26.367
police can never get to,
for instance.&nbsp; Ultimately,

00:38:26.367 --> 00:38:28.600
sixteen thousand
National Guard,

00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:31.900
LAPD, and California Highway
Patrol officers are brought

00:38:31.900 --> 00:38:35.467
in.&nbsp; They militarize
the zone in order to

00:38:35.467 --> 00:38:39.500
re-establish the peace.&nbsp;
It's a massive property

00:38:39.500 --> 00:38:41.900
riot.&nbsp; Food,
stores that sell food,

00:38:41.900 --> 00:38:43.400
liquor stores,
furniture stores,

00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:45.400
clothing stores
are destroyed,

00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:48.800
especially those owned by
middle- and upper-class

00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:54.200
whites.&nbsp; Churches, homes
and libraries are relatively

00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:55.200
untouched.

00:38:55.200 --> 00:39:01.267
And I say this just to--you
know some people will talk

00:39:01.267 --> 00:39:05.067
about whites--Watts as a
mindless insurrection.&nbsp; I'm

00:39:05.067 --> 00:39:08.767
not defending the riot
at any--to any extent,

00:39:08.767 --> 00:39:12.400
but it wasn't mindless.&nbsp;
Certainly something tactical

00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:16.200
by going after those
institutions that the

00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:21.100
residents thought were
keeping them down.&nbsp; Store

00:39:21.100 --> 00:39:22.967
owners who were
black would write up,

00:39:22.967 --> 00:39:25.067
you know, "soul brother"
in their window to prevent

00:39:25.067 --> 00:39:26.567
their store from being
attacked.&nbsp; Now some of them

00:39:26.567 --> 00:39:29.200
got attacked anyway, because
there's certainly going to

00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:32.900
be some level of chaos in
any kind of riot.&nbsp; But often

00:39:32.900 --> 00:39:38.300
they were passed
over.&nbsp; For white America,

00:39:38.300 --> 00:39:40.867
all of this happens
completely out of the blue.&nbsp;

00:39:42.967 --> 00:39:45.500
After all, Lyndon Baines
Johnson has just signed in

00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:47.600
the Voting Rights Act.&nbsp;
"What else do you people

00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:48.600
want?"

00:39:48.600 --> 00:39:52.000
is essentially the
mentality.&nbsp; "What else could

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:55.000
you want?"&nbsp; And what L.A.

00:39:55.000 --> 00:40:01.200
shows is that there are deep
and fundamental problems,

00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:02.300
that the civil
rights movement,

00:40:02.300 --> 00:40:04.167
as far as its most
famous rhetoric,

00:40:04.167 --> 00:40:07.000
you know, the right
to vote, you know,

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:09.900
the right to go, go into
the front door of a bus--a

00:40:09.900 --> 00:40:12.867
restaurant, ride in a bus
where you want to--L.A.

00:40:12.867 --> 00:40:15.600
had all those things
already.&nbsp; It didn't point to

00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:20.400
more fundamental economic
problems.&nbsp; That's what Watts

00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:27.200
was about.&nbsp; Now Watts, now
whether the riot--I'm not

00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:30.000
going to play counterfactual
history: would the riot have

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:31.000
happened if this or
that hadn't happened?&nbsp; I,

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:33.800
I don't know.&nbsp; But what is
clear is that just as people

00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:36.467
are struggling with this
new tactical change in the

00:40:36.467 --> 00:40:37.900
movement, got to
pursue the black vote,

00:40:37.900 --> 00:40:41.300
people are clearly
struggling with a shift in

00:40:41.300 --> 00:40:44.600
tone.&nbsp; The kind of militancy
and armed militancy that you

00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:50.300
see happening in Watts is
becoming more recognizable

00:40:50.300 --> 00:40:52.800
and more frequent.&nbsp; Part
of it grows out of the

00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:55.900
rhetoric, no
doubt, of Malcolm X,

00:40:55.900 --> 00:40:58.667
even after he disavowed a
lot of the rhetoric.&nbsp; This

00:40:58.667 --> 00:41:02.600
becomes very clear in next
week's reading.&nbsp; And part of

00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:05.667
it is--part of it's growing
out of an increasing U.S.

00:41:05.667 --> 00:41:08.600
military occupation in this
strange place they haven't

00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:10.067
quite figured out
yet called Vietnam,

00:41:10.067 --> 00:41:15.567
and people coming home from
Vietnam with a different

00:41:15.567 --> 00:41:19.600
sense of how to
pursue justice.&nbsp; There's a

00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:22.500
fundamental shift in tone
and you see it embodied in

00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:30.000
Watts, profound impatience.&nbsp;
Now impatience is not just

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:33.867
an urban or western and
northern phenomenon.&nbsp; It's

00:41:33.867 --> 00:41:36.267
an impatience that's in
the, in the heart of,

00:41:36.267 --> 00:41:37.500
quote, "the
movement" as well,

00:41:37.500 --> 00:41:42.600
in the southeastern
United States.&nbsp; Blacks are

00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:46.000
increasingly unhappy about,
or impatient and frustrated

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:49.167
with, the client-patron
relationship in the South,

00:41:49.167 --> 00:41:53.300
and throughout the country
really.&nbsp; And we'll see,

00:41:53.300 --> 00:41:56.200
we'll see next week, when
we start talking about the

00:41:56.200 --> 00:41:57.400
Black Panther Party, how
it becomes articulated in

00:41:57.400 --> 00:42:00.267
Oakland, California.&nbsp;
It's most famously the Black

00:42:00.267 --> 00:42:02.967
Panther Party.&nbsp; But it's
important to take a moment

00:42:02.967 --> 00:42:06.000
to talk about the first
Black Panther Party in the

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:08.500
context of shift and
tones.&nbsp; [computer beeps] Oh,

00:42:08.500 --> 00:42:10.300
that's my--I have
something happening soon,

00:42:10.300 --> 00:42:13.400
I guess, my computer telling
me I have to go.&nbsp; So let's

00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:19.400
look at the first
Black Panther Party.

00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:24.500
You have the march
from Selma to Montgomery,

00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:29.300
the, the famous march.&nbsp;
So much of the political

00:42:29.300 --> 00:42:31.200
rhetoric talks about
how--or historical rhetoric,

00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:34.067
it goes off without a
hitch, incredible federal

00:42:34.067 --> 00:42:37.567
protection.&nbsp; But a hallmark
to how great we are as a

00:42:37.567 --> 00:42:40.500
country because of how
peaceful it was.&nbsp; It wasn't

00:42:40.500 --> 00:42:43.867
so peaceful to everybody.&nbsp;&nbsp;
One of the activists who

00:42:43.867 --> 00:42:45.067
came down to
Selma to help out,

00:42:45.067 --> 00:42:49.067
a woman named Vi--Viola
Liuzzo from Michigan,

00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:54.100
her job was working support
for the march.&nbsp; And her job

00:42:54.100 --> 00:42:57.100
was to, in her car, ferry
people back from Montgomery,

00:42:57.100 --> 00:43:01.467
from Montgomery back to
Selma.&nbsp; She happens to be

00:43:01.467 --> 00:43:04.200
driving her car with
some of the marchers in it,

00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:05.400
driving through
Lowndes County,

00:43:05.400 --> 00:43:09.300
Alabama.&nbsp; A car
pulls up next to her,

00:43:09.300 --> 00:43:11.400
rolls down the window,
pulls out a shotgun,

00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:12.400
blows her away.&nbsp;&nbsp;A young man
named Stokely Carmichael,

00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:18.400
northerner raised in
the, in New York City,

00:43:26.167 --> 00:43:27.800
graduated from
Howard University,

00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:31.100
goes down to participate
in the Freedom Summer,

00:43:31.100 --> 00:43:35.067
rises to the leadership
circle in the Student

00:43:35.067 --> 00:43:36.067
Nonviolent
Coordinating Committee,

00:43:36.067 --> 00:43:37.300
he's sent--Stokely
Carmichael is sent to

00:43:37.300 --> 00:43:41.567
Lowndes County to figure out
what the heck is going on in

00:43:41.567 --> 00:43:46.400
this place.&nbsp; Trying to
organize the black vote,

00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:51.467
partly in honor of Liuzzo's
assassination.&nbsp; What he

00:43:51.467 --> 00:43:56.000
finds in Lowndes is a
population that is a

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:57.467
predominantly
black population,

00:43:57.467 --> 00:44:01.800
eighty-one percent black.&nbsp;
It's a black county.&nbsp; Black

00:44:01.800 --> 00:44:07.900
citizens of
Lowndes were poor,

00:44:07.900 --> 00:44:12.300
they were landless, and
economically dependent on a

00:44:12.300 --> 00:44:16.967
small, white, elite planter
society.&nbsp; It's apartheid.&nbsp;

00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:22.000
Blacks outnumbered
whites overwhelmingly,

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:28.100
eighty-one percent, but they
were not registered to vote,

00:44:28.100 --> 00:44:30.267
and they actually feared
civil rights agitation.&nbsp;

00:44:30.267 --> 00:44:32.400
It's like, "What are you
doing coming in here?&nbsp; Our

00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:38.900
life is horrible, but you're
going to get us killed."&nbsp; As

00:44:38.900 --> 00:44:40.400
Carmichael digs a
little deeper in Lowndes,

00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:43.667
he finds, finds a
different current though,

00:44:43.667 --> 00:44:51.400
and he just discovers that
trying to register black

00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:56.200
Lowndes County citizens to
vote in the Democratic Party

00:44:56.200 --> 00:44:58.100
is something he's really not
going to have much success

00:44:58.100 --> 00:45:00.367
doing.&nbsp; There's such
hostility and such

00:45:00.367 --> 00:45:04.700
hopelessness.&nbsp; But he
also discovers a level of

00:45:04.700 --> 00:45:10.600
militancy there as well.&nbsp; So
they form their own party,

00:45:10.600 --> 00:45:14.600
the Lowndes County
Freedom Organization,

00:45:14.600 --> 00:45:17.100
the LCFO.&nbsp; The
Lowndes County Freedom

00:45:17.100 --> 00:45:22.367
Organization.&nbsp; And it has as
its goal running candidates,

00:45:22.367 --> 00:45:25.700
developing a platform,
becoming a recognized party,

00:45:25.700 --> 00:45:27.700
an alternative to
the Democratic Party,

00:45:27.700 --> 00:45:31.667
which had no relevance to
black Mississippians living

00:45:31.667 --> 00:45:36.700
in Lowndes County.&nbsp; And the
LCFO chooses as its mascot

00:45:36.700 --> 00:45:41.100
the black panther.&nbsp;
And the logic was,

00:45:41.100 --> 00:45:43.200
LCFO leaders talked about
the black panther as an

00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:46.900
animal that retreats
when it's pursued,

00:45:46.900 --> 00:45:49.267
until it's
backed into a corner,

00:45:49.267 --> 00:45:51.567
and then it springs forth
with a life or death battle

00:45:51.567 --> 00:45:56.200
on its mind.&nbsp; And that's how
the Lowndes County farmers,

00:45:56.200 --> 00:45:59.800
they're all farmers,
felt.&nbsp; And importantly,

00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:04.200
they were armed.&nbsp; I mean,
and this is no big deal.&nbsp; I

00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:09.300
mean, farmers in the South,
everybody was armed.&nbsp; You

00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:11.300
shot your meals often.

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:17.467
The party was armed, and it
was uninterested in working

00:46:17.467 --> 00:46:20.900
with whites.&nbsp;
Whites who sympathized,

00:46:20.900 --> 00:46:21.900
who wanted to help
them, it's like,

00:46:21.900 --> 00:46:24.600
"No, forget it."&nbsp;
And this group,

00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:26.600
as we'll see next week,
becomes the inspiration for

00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:32.500
the famous Black Panther
Party.&nbsp; Now very quickly,

00:46:32.500 --> 00:46:36.600
by this point,
'65, SNCC had,

00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:38.567
you know, is
breaking apart from SCLC.

00:46:38.567 --> 00:46:41.000
It becomes
affiliated with the,

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:43.200
sort of the rising New
Left, the radical student

00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:46.967
organizations.&nbsp; It's
exploring other ideological

00:46:46.967 --> 00:46:50.300
options, instead its, its
of what was then certainly

00:46:50.300 --> 00:46:53.667
radical in 1960, you know,
integrating lunch counters,

00:46:53.667 --> 00:46:58.767
integrating places of, of,
of commerce.&nbsp; SNCC links up

00:46:58.767 --> 00:47:01.300
with the Students for
Democratic Society,

00:47:01.300 --> 00:47:03.700
SDS, for a while, but the
racial politics become too

00:47:03.700 --> 00:47:06.900
complex, because SNCC
leaders felt the whites were

00:47:06.900 --> 00:47:09.600
trying to take
control of SDS,

00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:10.900
black leaders in SNCC.

00:47:10.900 --> 00:47:15.700
In January of
1966, Samuel Younge,

00:47:15.700 --> 00:47:19.267
a twenty-year-old Navy
vet, African American,

00:47:19.267 --> 00:47:21.600
recruited by SNCC to be
an organizer in Tuskegee,

00:47:24.767 --> 00:47:29.500
he's killed for using a
white bathroom.&nbsp; At that

00:47:29.500 --> 00:47:33.067
point, SNCC comes out
against the war in Vietnam

00:47:33.067 --> 00:47:36.900
and, in doing so, isolates
itself from mainstream civil

00:47:36.900 --> 00:47:40.100
rights organizations.&nbsp;
Another major break in the

00:47:40.100 --> 00:47:42.100
fabric, rip in the fabric.

00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:45.700
In the wake of this, the
Atlanta cell within SNCC,

00:47:45.700 --> 00:47:46.900
which is
increase--increasingly

00:47:46.900 --> 00:47:51.367
radical, starts getting
racially restless.&nbsp; In the

00:47:51.367 --> 00:47:54.467
spring of '66,
Stokely Carmichael,

00:47:54.467 --> 00:47:56.467
essentially now
the leader of SNCC,

00:47:56.467 --> 00:47:58.800
produces a position
paper that says: "White

00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:01.367
participation, as
practiced in the past,

00:48:01.367 --> 00:48:04.600
is now obsolete.&nbsp; If we
are to proceed toward true

00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:07.067
liberation, we must cut
ourselves off from white

00:48:07.067 --> 00:48:10.167
people.&nbsp; We must form
our own institutions,

00:48:10.167 --> 00:48:13.200
write our own histories."

00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:14.967
"White participation, as
practiced in the past,

00:48:14.967 --> 00:48:18.600
is now obsolete."&nbsp; Stokely
Carmichael is now the chair

00:48:18.600 --> 00:48:23.600
of SNCC.&nbsp; Whites are now
kicked out of the movement.&nbsp;

00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:27.867
I'm going to
stop right there,

00:48:27.867 --> 00:48:29.100
but we are
literally, quite literally,

00:48:29.100 --> 00:48:32.100
at the cusp of the
famous articulation of Black

00:48:32.100 --> 00:48:34.767
Power.&nbsp; Certainly all the
pieces are now in place,

00:48:34.767 --> 00:48:37.600
and the movement, the famous
movement that we've all been

00:48:37.600 --> 00:48:40.900
taught about in our little
grade books and stuff,

00:48:40.900 --> 00:48:43.767
begins its very quick
descent into completely

00:48:43.767 --> 00:48:46.567
splintering apart.&nbsp; Those
are the events from '64 to

00:48:46.567 --> 00:48:48.167
'66.&nbsp; We'll pick
up from there,

00:48:48.167 --> 00:48:50.167
at there on Monday.

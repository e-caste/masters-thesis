00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.090
Prof: I want to start
today with some stories from the

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:06.500
newspapers: to set a tone.
 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.890
It was over the last few years.
 

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:14.480
Tehran: one afternoon Fatima
Eskandari opened the front metal

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.299
gate of the shelter she runs for
runaway girls in central Tehran

00:00:19.299 --> 00:00:24.950
and was confronted with two men,
armed with knives and rifles.

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:26.499
"Who are you?"
 

00:00:26.499 --> 00:00:27.210
She asked.
 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.920
"We are the uncles of a
girl named Ranach,

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.570
we are told that you are
keeping Ranach,"

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.280
and indeed that was true.
 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.097
Ranach was 16 years old,
and she was inside,

00:00:37.097 --> 00:00:40.832
recovering from the bruises
that she suffered at the hands

00:00:40.832 --> 00:00:42.470
of these same uncles.
 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.070
She had run away from home to
escape them.

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.411
The uncles had driven from
Sanandaj in the northwest corner

00:00:49.411 --> 00:00:53.520
of Iran, hundreds of miles away;
they demanded to see their

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.100
niece.
 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.426
The uncle said she had shamed
the family by leaving home a few

00:00:58.426 --> 00:00:59.420
days before.
 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.640
They had come to behead her.
 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.320
They were very open about this.
 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.799
There was no secret.
 

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:08.555
Staten Island,
New York: A 17-year-old girl

00:01:08.555 --> 00:01:11.510
worked as a cashier in a
convenience store.

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.242
The store owner said that the
girl was stealing from the

00:01:14.242 --> 00:01:16.230
register and he was going to
fire her.

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:19.805
The girl went to her father and
said that the store owner had

00:01:19.805 --> 00:01:20.580
groped her.
 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.069
The father flew into a rage,
grabbed a baseball bat and a

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:29.319
gun, went down to the store,
and killed two people.

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:33.928
Islamabad, Pakistan Zahida
Perveen, 21-years-old was

00:01:33.928 --> 00:01:38.265
pregnant in 1998 when her
husband, Mehmood Iqbal,

00:01:38.265 --> 00:01:41.970
bound her hands and feet with a
rope.

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.290
First he shoved a rod in one of
her eyes, blinding her,

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.930
then cut off her nose and ears.
 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.260
He SUSPECTED her of seeing
another man.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:57.122
Tuscaloosa, Alabama:
Felicia Scott already had two

00:01:57.122 --> 00:02:01.930
sons, but she had an obsessive
desire to have another baby.

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.337
She convinced her boyfriend to
help her get one,

00:02:05.337 --> 00:02:08.163
so they went out,
shot a pregnant woman,

00:02:08.163 --> 00:02:11.500
and cut the full term fetus
from her womb.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.341
Saudi Arabia:
New York Times--A young

00:02:14.341 --> 00:02:16.389
woman was raped by seven men.
 

00:02:16.389 --> 00:02:19.008
She pressed charges.
 

00:02:19.008 --> 00:02:24.125
The Saudi Court sentenced HER
to 200 lashes--200 lashes is

00:02:24.125 --> 00:02:26.188
almost a lethal dose.
 

00:02:26.188 --> 00:02:29.544
Dominican Republic:
Crucita Medina is 18,

00:02:29.544 --> 00:02:34.495
she's been married for a year
in which her husband Jose beat

00:02:34.495 --> 00:02:36.090
her constantly.
 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.331
She had the courage to separate
from him but she met with Jose

00:02:40.331 --> 00:02:43.878
after their separation when he
asked her to talk.

00:02:43.878 --> 00:02:46.369
He took her to a desolate
street on his motorcycle and

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:47.449
they had an argument.
 

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:51.727
He grabbed a container he had
filled with - what they call the

00:02:51.727 --> 00:02:54.399
devil's acid,
- a mixture of gasoline,

00:02:54.399 --> 00:02:57.473
hydrochloric acid,
car battery acid,

00:02:57.473 --> 00:03:00.310
urine and other chemicals.
 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.060
He threw it at Crucida.
 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.860
The liquid disfigured her
permanently.

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.524
It burned her face,
her arms, the right side of her

00:03:07.524 --> 00:03:09.389
chest, and a portion of her
legs.

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:13.900
She is still trying to bring
her ex-husband to justice.

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:19.758
Gosarigaon, Bangladesh:
I'm almost done with this.

00:03:19.758 --> 00:03:24.526
The village elders met under a
lychee tree to put a value on a

00:03:24.526 --> 00:03:27.729
Payara Bigum's grotesquely
ruined face.

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:30.389
A young man had become obsessed
with her;

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:33.258
she was married and he was
turned away.

00:03:33.258 --> 00:03:36.354
He took his revenge with
sulfuric acid to erase the

00:03:36.354 --> 00:03:39.943
beauty that had once enchanted
him and to empty her life of

00:03:39.943 --> 00:03:40.810
happiness.
 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.274
Her cheeks melted,
her right eye was blinded and

00:03:44.274 --> 00:03:45.970
hollowed to a crater.
 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.214
The husband had to bribe the
prosecutors before they would

00:03:49.214 --> 00:03:50.580
even take up the case.
 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:55.687
Eventually the perpetrator's
family had to pay a fee of

00:03:55.687 --> 00:03:56.538
$3,000.
 

00:03:56.538 --> 00:03:59.541
In one year,
the year I have statistics for,

00:03:59.541 --> 00:04:03.378
1999, there are 174 acid
attacks in Bangladesh and those

00:04:03.378 --> 00:04:06.658
are the ones that were
officially reported.

00:04:06.658 --> 00:04:10.492
Of course, probably the vast
majority of these never get

00:04:10.492 --> 00:04:11.258
reported.
 

00:04:11.258 --> 00:04:14.126
The article mentioned a
13-year-old girl who was

00:04:14.126 --> 00:04:15.590
attacked as she slept.
 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:18.802
Some victims die,
some are forced to marry their

00:04:18.802 --> 00:04:22.971
attacker, another was forbidden
to come home until she allowed

00:04:22.971 --> 00:04:25.569
her husband to take a second
wife.

00:04:25.569 --> 00:04:30.286
Well these stories are
obviously at the extreme of

00:04:30.286 --> 00:04:34.353
human behavior,
but the purpose of giving you

00:04:34.353 --> 00:04:38.538
all that is to explain that
human sexual behavior has

00:04:38.538 --> 00:04:42.315
extremely deep roots,
very emotional,

00:04:42.315 --> 00:04:46.910
and very hard to change or
manipulate.

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:51.023
Male/female relationships are
very difficult for humans to

00:04:51.023 --> 00:04:51.889
cope with.
 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:55.860
I think it shouldn't
particularly surprise you that

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.069
human sexuality is not
particularly driven by rational

00:05:00.069 --> 00:05:01.338
calculation.
 

00:05:01.338 --> 00:05:05.213
The few stories that I've
pulled out of the newspapers are

00:05:05.213 --> 00:05:07.524
just the tip,
clearly just the tip,

00:05:07.524 --> 00:05:09.834
of an iceberg,
of a very widespread

00:05:09.834 --> 00:05:10.990
phenomenon.
 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:15.125
In the long course of human
history across cultures you see

00:05:15.125 --> 00:05:17.254
are the--
I gave you everything from

00:05:17.254 --> 00:05:20.716
Brooklyn to Bangladesh--
these very similar sorts of

00:05:20.716 --> 00:05:21.920
things happen.
 

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:26.060
Females, through the long
course of history and in most

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:30.892
cultures, where most humans have
lived, females are treated very

00:05:30.892 --> 00:05:31.660
badly.
 

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:33.490
There's a huge amount of
battering.

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:38.610
Battering is the prime human
version of violence,

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:41.824
and females are so
discriminated against that

00:05:41.824 --> 00:05:45.480
statistics indicate that there's
something now,

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:48.970
right now, something like a
hundred million missing females.

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:53.899
That these females are either
aborted before they're born,

00:05:53.899 --> 00:05:58.007
killed by infanticide,
pretty much as soon as they're

00:05:58.007 --> 00:06:00.533
born,
or neglected so that they don't

00:06:00.533 --> 00:06:02.923
get the food,
or they don't get the medical

00:06:02.923 --> 00:06:04.449
care that their brothers get.
 

00:06:04.449 --> 00:06:10.211
There's a dearth of something
like a hundred million women in

00:06:10.211 --> 00:06:11.939
the world today.
 

00:06:11.939 --> 00:06:17.410
These are extreme incidents but
it's an extremely common thing.

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:21.103
One of the purposes of this
course is to try to get you to

00:06:21.103 --> 00:06:23.759
understand what is causing all
of this.

00:06:23.759 --> 00:06:28.663
From a biological point of view
this abuse of females is

00:06:28.663 --> 00:06:30.269
extremely weird.
 

00:06:30.269 --> 00:06:35.461
Males, as you know,
can only reproduce via a female

00:06:35.461 --> 00:06:38.233
and so--
and evolution is--the name of

00:06:38.233 --> 00:06:41.435
the game is reproducing,
so almost all species--what

00:06:41.435 --> 00:06:43.509
kind of female do the males
want?

00:06:43.509 --> 00:06:45.910
They want the healthiest,
most well protected,

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:49.778
the best fed female,
and you'll see some examples of

00:06:49.778 --> 00:06:54.557
the extremes to which males will
go to provide this so that that

00:06:54.557 --> 00:06:58.956
female can produce offspring for
that male and carry on the

00:06:58.956 --> 00:07:00.550
evolution game.
 

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:04.617
In humans, we find that it's
very general that females are

00:07:04.617 --> 00:07:09.166
treated atrociously,
and it just doesn't make sense

00:07:09.166 --> 00:07:14.690
that human males should keep
many of their females hungry,

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:16.629
sick, and abused.
 

00:07:16.629 --> 00:07:19.382
In childbirth,
if a woman does give birth to a

00:07:19.382 --> 00:07:22.014
child they can often be
underweight, sickly,

00:07:22.014 --> 00:07:25.379
and it's because the mother is
not in great health.

00:07:25.379 --> 00:07:29.069
This is all a biological
disaster the way human males

00:07:29.069 --> 00:07:31.980
treat human females and we don't
know--

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:34.934
I mean we do--we have some
idea, why humans do that and the

00:07:34.934 --> 00:07:37.940
first part of the course we'll
talk something about that.

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:41.048
That's on the individual level,
and evolution works on an

00:07:41.048 --> 00:07:44.660
individual level,
but if you think on a species

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:46.920
level,
missing a hundred million of

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:49.918
your breeders,
that does not sound like a

00:07:49.918 --> 00:07:53.310
great tactic for survival of the
species.

00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:55.346
I spent some time,
when I started getting

00:07:55.346 --> 00:07:58.990
interested in this whole topic,
reading the anthropological

00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:01.595
literature,
the sociological literature,

00:08:01.595 --> 00:08:04.675
the feminist literature,
and basically I thought all

00:08:04.675 --> 00:08:06.528
those explanations were a crock.
 

00:08:06.528 --> 00:08:10.490
I don't think they came close
to an answer.

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:15.781
In my own studies I had to go
back to the very beginning and

00:08:15.781 --> 00:08:19.639
understand what sex was really
all about.

00:08:19.639 --> 00:08:23.194
I'm going to tell you a few
important things about sex and

00:08:23.194 --> 00:08:24.129
reproduction.
 

00:08:24.129 --> 00:08:27.017
The first one is that
reproduction turns out to be

00:08:27.017 --> 00:08:28.019
very difficult.
 

00:08:28.019 --> 00:08:31.535
One day I was sitting over in
our botanical garden under a

00:08:31.535 --> 00:08:35.365
beautiful big oak--
huge oak tree that they have,

00:08:35.365 --> 00:08:40.788
and the ground was just covered
with acorns under this tree,

00:08:40.788 --> 00:08:44.120
and I asked one of the forestry
people,

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:46.149
because that's the kind of
things that they know,

00:08:46.149 --> 00:08:49.850
I asked them how many acorns
has this tree produced?

00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:54.477
They said, well the wind--this
spread is so much and this line,

00:08:54.477 --> 00:08:58.658
and you know it's so deep,
and they came up with probably

00:08:58.658 --> 00:09:00.600
750,000 acorns a year.
 

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:04.321
I thought wow,
so I checked the literature and

00:09:04.321 --> 00:09:08.951
found that people that collect
these notes for commercial

00:09:08.951 --> 00:09:11.652
purposes,
a good oak tree can produce

00:09:11.652 --> 00:09:13.879
five hundred pounds of acorns a
year,

00:09:13.879 --> 00:09:18.335
and many sources say that an
oak tree produces millions of

00:09:18.335 --> 00:09:20.288
acorns in its lifetime.
 

00:09:20.288 --> 00:09:24.208
Wow, a lot of reproduction
right, there's got to be sex

00:09:24.208 --> 00:09:25.080
before it.
 

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:28.586
Then I asked myself,
how many of these million

00:09:28.586 --> 00:09:32.559
acorns survive to make a tree
like their parents?

00:09:32.559 --> 00:09:36.538
What's the answer?
 

00:09:36.538 --> 00:09:39.279
Basic biology question,
you might know it.

00:09:39.279 --> 00:09:41.860
Well, what if each tree on
average,

00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:46.928
taking an average of tree made
two acorns,

00:09:46.928 --> 00:09:48.490
how many acorns would there
be--how many oak trees would

00:09:48.490 --> 00:09:50.388
there be in the--
made two acorns that made

00:09:50.388 --> 00:09:53.919
trees--how many oak trees would
there be in the next generation?

00:09:53.919 --> 00:09:58.413
Twice as many as now;
what if they only did--and so

00:09:58.413 --> 00:10:03.258
that can't continue because then
the Earth would immediately fill

00:10:03.258 --> 00:10:07.269
up with oak trees and we'd be
this deep in acorns.

00:10:07.269 --> 00:10:10.653
Similarly, if the trees
produced less on average,

00:10:10.653 --> 00:10:13.543
less than one,
what will happen to the oak

00:10:13.543 --> 00:10:14.389
species?
 

00:10:14.389 --> 00:10:15.850
It goes extinct.
 

00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:21.495
So, over the long time,
on average, each oak tree has

00:10:21.495 --> 00:10:27.684
only one acorn that grows up to
be an acorn producing tree

00:10:27.684 --> 00:10:28.879
itself.
 

00:10:28.879 --> 00:10:33.695
That's an amazing fact--it puts
out millions of acorns and only

00:10:33.695 --> 00:10:34.860
one survives.
 

00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:39.658
Of course this is true not only
for trees but fish,

00:10:39.658 --> 00:10:42.840
which spew out--fish
females--huge numbers,

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:46.048
hundreds, tens of thousands,
hundreds of thousands of eggs;

00:10:46.048 --> 00:10:49.110
or males of many,
many species that spew out

00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:52.245
billions of sperms that,
in a sexual species,

00:10:52.245 --> 00:10:55.307
the way mammals are,
two parents on average,

00:10:55.307 --> 00:10:56.658
two children.
 

00:10:56.658 --> 00:10:59.469
If two parents for a species
average more than two children,

00:10:59.469 --> 00:11:01.897
the world fills up with
squirrels or whatever animal

00:11:01.897 --> 00:11:03.038
we're talking about.
 

00:11:03.038 --> 00:11:06.509
If they have less than two over
a long run, they've gone

00:11:06.509 --> 00:11:07.139
extinct.
 

00:11:07.139 --> 00:11:09.760
Most species,
in fact, in the history have

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:10.720
gone extinct.
 

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:14.846
The average of current species
has got to be 1:1 or 2:2

00:11:14.846 --> 00:11:19.509
depending on how you count,
but for most species it's less

00:11:19.509 --> 00:11:23.460
than that because most species
have gone extinct.

00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:27.960
So, the answer is,
it is brutally difficult to

00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:29.158
reproduce.
 

00:11:29.158 --> 00:11:33.041
If any given individual in a
species produces a lot of

00:11:33.041 --> 00:11:35.077
children,
more than one or two,

00:11:35.077 --> 00:11:37.009
depending on how you're
counting,

00:11:37.009 --> 00:11:40.668
then that means that some other
individuals are having less,

00:11:40.668 --> 00:11:41.950
again, unless the species are
humans,

00:11:41.950 --> 00:11:44.788
which are about the only
species that are increasing

00:11:44.788 --> 00:11:46.678
continuously over the long time.
 

00:11:46.678 --> 00:11:49.684
As an example,
they now, by this genetic

00:11:49.684 --> 00:11:53.154
testing have tested:
how many descendants does

00:11:53.154 --> 00:11:54.850
Genghis Khan have?
 

00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:59.263
The answer is 16 million
descendants, this one guy,

00:11:59.263 --> 00:12:01.470
so that's an awful lot.
 

00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:03.330
Guess how he did it?
 

00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:06.278
By killing a lot of men and
raping their women.

00:12:06.278 --> 00:12:09.724
So he has that many descendants
because an awful lot of men,

00:12:09.724 --> 00:12:12.759
all the men he killed,
don't have any descendants.

00:12:12.759 --> 00:12:15.893
That's just Genghis Khan,
the Mongol Horde had a lot of

00:12:15.893 --> 00:12:19.259
males and I think they spread
their seeds quite widely,

00:12:19.259 --> 00:12:24.118
and a lot of males and
conquered people just didn't

00:12:24.118 --> 00:12:25.090
survive.
 

00:12:25.090 --> 00:12:28.928
Of course every army in the
world has done--

00:12:28.928 --> 00:12:31.940
essentially all--have done a
huge amount of raping,

00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:37.352
and it's a wonderful instrument
of gene flow in the human

00:12:37.352 --> 00:12:38.610
population.
 

00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:42.178
Because reproduction is
actually so difficult,

00:12:42.178 --> 00:12:49.287
species have evolved all kinds
of fantastic mechanisms for

00:12:49.287 --> 00:12:54.649
trying to be successful at
reproduction,

00:12:54.649 --> 00:12:56.389
so that's Point One.
 

00:12:56.389 --> 00:12:59.769
Point Two is that sex is not
fair.

00:12:59.769 --> 00:13:02.460
It's not only difficult but
it's not fair.

00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:09.928
Sex goes way back in evolution
and even bacteria do it.

00:13:09.928 --> 00:13:13.190
This is--the biologists here
are laughing.

00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:17.158
This is the bacteria that are
in your colon and they have sex

00:13:17.158 --> 00:13:20.398
in this manner,
and so right now billions of

00:13:20.398 --> 00:13:24.570
sexual acts are taking place in
your unspeakable parts,

00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:27.750
and this is the way they do it.
 

00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:34.740
Now, in something like this,
actually the exchange of DNA

00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:40.530
can be either way and this is--
even though the hairy guy on

00:13:40.530 --> 00:13:42.918
the left is producing that long
pilus,

00:13:42.918 --> 00:13:47.306
as it's called,
there's more or less equality

00:13:47.306 --> 00:13:49.298
of sexuality here.
 

00:13:49.298 --> 00:13:52.048
But when it comes to higher
organisms you get quite a

00:13:52.048 --> 00:13:53.000
different story.
 

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.950
You all know the story the
chicken and the egg.

00:13:54.950 --> 00:13:58.019
Well the way I tell it is the
poor chicken,

00:13:58.019 --> 00:14:01.908
the chicken has to build this
big egg,

00:14:01.908 --> 00:14:04.881
it has to eat like crazy,
put all that protein and fat

00:14:04.881 --> 00:14:07.635
into the egg which are--
if you're not fed in the

00:14:07.635 --> 00:14:09.690
barnyard--which are hard to come
by,

00:14:09.690 --> 00:14:12.658
and then once the chicken is
hatched guess who sits--

00:14:12.658 --> 00:14:14.980
once the egg comes--out guess
who sits on the egg?

00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:15.799
The female.
 

00:14:15.799 --> 00:14:17.500
Guess who protects the young?
 

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:19.090
The female.
 

00:14:19.090 --> 00:14:20.340
So that's chickens.
 

00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:22.850
You can go all the way up to
humans;

00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:26.398
females have to spend nine
months pregnant and then in most

00:14:26.398 --> 00:14:29.946
societies and most times females
are the ones that have the

00:14:29.946 --> 00:14:32.759
burden of responsibility for the
children.

00:14:32.759 --> 00:14:37.115
Meanwhile in all this,
males just produce a little

00:14:37.115 --> 00:14:40.558
speck of protoplasm,
insert it into the female,

00:14:40.558 --> 00:14:43.419
say, 'bye-bye,
I've had my quickie and I'm

00:14:43.419 --> 00:14:46.744
off,' and--
not in all species--but in most

00:14:46.744 --> 00:14:50.184
species,
the male has a very minimal

00:14:50.184 --> 00:14:55.889
part in reproduction and the
female has this huge burden.

00:14:55.889 --> 00:14:57.220
Now why does that come about?
 

00:14:57.220 --> 00:15:00.061
You'd think evolution would
require that females just

00:15:00.061 --> 00:15:03.230
wouldn't play this game in
evolution and they would require

00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:05.580
a more equal distribution of the
labor.

00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:11.107
Well it turns out it
is--starts--as a division of

00:15:11.107 --> 00:15:12.028
labor.
 

00:15:12.028 --> 00:15:15.048
The first animals to evolve,
first of anything,

00:15:15.048 --> 00:15:17.899
were probably--were almost
certainly in the sea,

00:15:17.899 --> 00:15:22.594
and stuck down on the bottom or
floating around and so they

00:15:22.594 --> 00:15:23.889
couldn't move.
 

00:15:23.889 --> 00:15:27.658
How do you mate if you can't
get up and find your mate?

00:15:27.658 --> 00:15:30.649
Well you just spew out your
sperms into the ocean;

00:15:30.649 --> 00:15:33.953
you spew out your eggs into the
ocean, and you hope that they

00:15:33.953 --> 00:15:34.340
meet.
 

00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:38.437
Not a very efficient mechanism,
but at that stage,

00:15:38.437 --> 00:15:43.624
the male has produced zillions
of sperms, and the female has to

00:15:43.624 --> 00:15:46.048
produce zillions of eggs.
 

00:15:46.048 --> 00:15:49.628
If you're an animal and you
have to produce so many of

00:15:49.628 --> 00:15:53.611
anything, gametes in this case,
each one is going to be very

00:15:53.611 --> 00:15:54.220
tiny.
 

00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:58.129
Two tiny things meet and fuse;
you've still got a tiny thing.

00:15:58.129 --> 00:16:01.350
The odds of survival of a tiny
thing are not very great.

00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:05.650
Evolution doesn't like that
idea of the male and the female

00:16:05.650 --> 00:16:09.730
both spewing out lots and lots
of these tiny gametes.

00:16:09.730 --> 00:16:14.678
What happens eventually is that
the two sexes separate,

00:16:14.678 --> 00:16:17.370
that the female's job is to
make a big enough egg,

00:16:17.370 --> 00:16:20.208
with enough nutrients in it,
so that the organism can

00:16:20.208 --> 00:16:23.349
survive,
and the male's job is to go

00:16:23.349 --> 00:16:24.759
find that egg.
 

00:16:24.759 --> 00:16:28.490
What do males have--what have
the sperms evolved?

00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:33.570
Tails, to take them swimming.
 

00:16:33.570 --> 00:16:37.726
They find--their job is to find
the egg, so there still has to

00:16:37.726 --> 00:16:41.474
be lots of those and they have
to expend a lot of energy

00:16:41.474 --> 00:16:42.360
swimming.
 

00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:47.158
It's still an equal amount of
investment.

00:16:47.158 --> 00:16:50.980
Then the whole animal--once
evolution proceeds,

00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:54.259
the whole animal can now get up
and walk over and find a female,

00:16:54.259 --> 00:16:57.573
or vice versa,
and now they can copulate or do

00:16:57.573 --> 00:17:01.110
some sort of insemination very
close together.

00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:05.640
This now does not require
zillions and zillions of sperms.

00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:08.759
If you're--if the eggs they
already laid,

00:17:08.759 --> 00:17:12.051
like a fish in a nest,
the male just lays the sperms

00:17:12.051 --> 00:17:15.871
right on top of the eggs,
and you need some surplus over

00:17:15.871 --> 00:17:19.961
the number of eggs but nothing
to compensate for the amount of

00:17:19.961 --> 00:17:22.509
energy she's putting into her
eggs.

00:17:22.509 --> 00:17:24.358
You start getting an inequality.
 

00:17:24.358 --> 00:17:32.803
As soon as animals can find
each other and mate in a more

00:17:32.803 --> 00:17:39.587
spatially enclosed way,
then you start getting

00:17:39.587 --> 00:17:41.848
inequality.
 

00:17:41.848 --> 00:17:44.161
Evolution goes down that path
because it's turned out to be a

00:17:44.161 --> 00:17:45.992
very,
very effective path,

00:17:45.992 --> 00:17:49.880
and what you get is that
females make a few eggs,

00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:53.940
her eggs are very expensive,
they are expensive and rare.

00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:57.019
Males still make many,
many sperms;

00:17:57.019 --> 00:18:01.380
his sperms are plentiful and
cheap.

00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:05.318
This is what we call a sexual
dimorphism that males and

00:18:05.318 --> 00:18:09.038
females are taking different
evolutionary routes.

00:18:09.038 --> 00:18:13.625
Once they take different
evolutionary routes then

00:18:13.625 --> 00:18:18.498
different reproductive
strategies come into play for

00:18:18.498 --> 00:18:20.598
males and females.
 

00:18:20.598 --> 00:18:23.230
A male, through the first
billion years of evolution has

00:18:23.230 --> 00:18:26.141
been producing a lot of sperm,
and now all of sudden he

00:18:26.141 --> 00:18:29.634
figures out how to swim over to
a female and he doesn't need all

00:18:29.634 --> 00:18:32.715
those sperms but he's still--
evolution is conservative,

00:18:32.715 --> 00:18:34.980
it's still--
he's still producing all these

00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:35.410
sperms.
 

00:18:35.410 --> 00:18:39.230
What is evolution going to do
with all those sperms?

00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:42.693
One thing they can do is--he
can evolve backwards and just

00:18:42.693 --> 00:18:43.848
make fewer sperm.
 

00:18:43.848 --> 00:18:45.803
That would save him energy,
it would be good for him a

00:18:45.803 --> 00:18:48.267
little bit,
but it wouldn't really get him

00:18:48.267 --> 00:18:51.714
an awful lot more children,
which is the name of the

00:18:51.714 --> 00:18:52.759
evolution game.
 

00:18:52.759 --> 00:18:55.082
Now what he can do with those
excess sperms,

00:18:55.082 --> 00:18:56.269
find another female.
 

00:18:56.269 --> 00:19:00.789
That his limit--there stops
being a limit on the number of

00:19:00.789 --> 00:19:05.627
females that he can inseminate
he spreads his sperm to as many

00:19:05.627 --> 00:19:07.769
females as he can find.
 

00:19:07.769 --> 00:19:12.470
This dimorphism that sperm are
cheap and plentiful,

00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:15.814
while eggs are expensive and
rare, leads to different

00:19:15.814 --> 00:19:19.028
strategies of reproduction in
males and females.

00:19:19.028 --> 00:19:21.273
It also sets up some odd
situations where,

00:19:21.273 --> 00:19:23.298
for instance,
males are expendable.

00:19:23.298 --> 00:19:27.843
If one male can fertilize a lot
of females, females don't need a

00:19:27.843 --> 00:19:29.430
lot of males around.
 

00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:32.380
For instance,
there's a certain female wasp

00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:34.980
that lays its egg in a
caterpillar.

00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:37.730
Wasps are one of the major
predators of caterpillars;

00:19:37.730 --> 00:19:40.917
they lay the egg in,
the egg hatches and starts

00:19:40.917 --> 00:19:42.858
eating up the caterpillar.
 

00:19:42.858 --> 00:19:47.253
All of the eggs that are laid
in a single caterpillar compete

00:19:47.253 --> 00:19:51.430
with each other for the food,
that is, the caterpillar.

00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:55.733
What happens is evolution has
arranged that the females hatch

00:19:55.733 --> 00:19:59.680
first and they eat up all their
brothers except one,

00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:04.229
and then that one male can
fertilize all his sisters and

00:20:04.229 --> 00:20:05.470
things go on.
 

00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:08.400
The males are expendable in
that case,

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:11.028
and if the females just ignored
them and let them live,

00:20:11.028 --> 00:20:14.180
the males would be competing
with the females for food,

00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:15.838
the females would grow less big
and healthy,

00:20:15.838 --> 00:20:22.378
and they would have less eggs
and evolution doesn't like that

00:20:22.378 --> 00:20:24.450
kind of a system.
 

00:20:24.450 --> 00:20:27.394
We'll--all of these things,
if you think,

00:20:27.394 --> 00:20:31.588
it's not very difficult to find
human examples of this.

00:20:31.588 --> 00:20:35.450
Who goes off to war and gets
killed?

00:20:35.450 --> 00:20:38.900
Males, and very often you don't
very any reproductive--any

00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:41.868
change in rate;
the females manages to get

00:20:41.868 --> 00:20:43.660
inseminated, in humans.
 

00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:49.603
In lots and lots of species,
the number of males is really

00:20:49.603 --> 00:20:55.859
not a critical factor in the
amount of reproduction that goes

00:20:55.859 --> 00:20:56.588
on.
 

00:20:56.588 --> 00:20:59.788
Males can inseminate many
females,

00:20:59.788 --> 00:21:03.528
but females want to worry about
the survival of each egg,

00:21:03.528 --> 00:21:07.208
and similarly again,
this is pretty obvious in

00:21:07.208 --> 00:21:10.339
humans that a female,
if she gets pregnant,

00:21:10.339 --> 00:21:12.960
is going to be spending nine
months pregnant,

00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:15.808
and then breast feeds and won't
get pregnant again,

00:21:15.808 --> 00:21:18.719
so it's at least a year and
probably at least a year and a

00:21:18.719 --> 00:21:21.220
half before that female can get
pregnant again.

00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:25.542
We almost always bear only one
child with an occasional twin or

00:21:25.542 --> 00:21:28.038
so forth,
so a very low rate of

00:21:28.038 --> 00:21:32.307
reproduction where a male
doesn't have any such kind of

00:21:32.307 --> 00:21:33.019
limit.
 

00:21:33.019 --> 00:21:36.857
This does not mean that females
are monogamous,

00:21:36.857 --> 00:21:41.779
because there are many other
reasons why a female might want

00:21:41.779 --> 00:21:43.700
to have many mates.
 

00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:45.890
First of all,
we'll see, she might want to

00:21:45.890 --> 00:21:47.598
get resources from many males.
 

00:21:47.598 --> 00:21:51.836
You'll see she sometimes will
not mate with a male unless that

00:21:51.836 --> 00:21:53.990
male gives her some resource.
 

00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:58.289
She might want to mate with a
variety of males because she

00:21:58.289 --> 00:22:01.460
can't tell which one has the
best genes.

00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:04.637
She many want to mate with many
males if her environment is

00:22:04.637 --> 00:22:06.391
unpredictable,
and even if she can tell

00:22:06.391 --> 00:22:08.202
something about his genes,
she doesn't know what the

00:22:08.202 --> 00:22:09.980
environment for her children are
going to be like,

00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:12.630
so she wants to shake up the
deck and try--

00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:17.578
have a variety of children with
a variety of different genes.

00:22:17.578 --> 00:22:20.318
She might want each male to
think that he's the father of

00:22:20.318 --> 00:22:22.862
the children so that he
doesn't--that he protects and

00:22:22.862 --> 00:22:24.329
doesn't kill the children.
 

00:22:24.329 --> 00:22:26.328
There are species who do that.
 

00:22:26.328 --> 00:22:29.917
There's something called sperm
competition where she may want

00:22:29.917 --> 00:22:33.327
to have a whole variety of
different sperms from different

00:22:33.327 --> 00:22:36.019
males in her and then the sperms
compete.

00:22:36.019 --> 00:22:40.308
Even though this sort of comic
book presentation says,

00:22:40.308 --> 00:22:43.858
all males are promiscuous and
males want to go around and have

00:22:43.858 --> 00:22:46.625
a lot of sex,
and the females want one,

00:22:46.625 --> 00:22:50.960
there's many species with many
reasons why a female may also

00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:52.868
want to be promiscuous.
 

00:22:52.868 --> 00:22:56.718
It used to be believed that
many species were in fact

00:22:56.718 --> 00:22:57.680
monogamous.
 

00:22:57.680 --> 00:23:01.617
Birds are a very good example:
what you observe is that a male

00:23:01.617 --> 00:23:05.170
and a female meet at the
beginning of mating season,

00:23:05.170 --> 00:23:07.318
they stay together all mating
season,

00:23:07.318 --> 00:23:10.096
she maybe sits on the eggs,
and he brings worms or some

00:23:10.096 --> 00:23:12.309
combination thereof,
and people thought,

00:23:12.309 --> 00:23:13.450
'Well this is great.
 

00:23:13.450 --> 00:23:17.420
This is monogamy and what
wonderful animals they are.'

00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:22.662
Now we can do DNA testing and
it isn't so--apparently--so they

00:23:22.662 --> 00:23:27.731
call that now social monogamy
and distinguish it from sexual

00:23:27.731 --> 00:23:28.848
monogamy.
 

00:23:28.848 --> 00:23:33.039
While social monogamy is as
we've always believed it to be,

00:23:33.039 --> 00:23:35.930
sexual monogamy is almost
nonexistent.

00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:40.355
In species--when they
measured--it turns out 10% to

00:23:40.355 --> 00:23:45.578
70% of the progeny had been
sired by someone other than what

00:23:45.578 --> 00:23:48.588
they called the resident male.
 

00:23:48.588 --> 00:23:52.594
One article I read claimed that
there's only one species where

00:23:52.594 --> 00:23:56.730
it is known for sure that they
are 100% sexually monogamous,

00:23:56.730 --> 00:23:59.849
and in that case the male and
female physically fuse together,

00:23:59.849 --> 00:24:05.358
so neither can go anywhere.
 

00:24:05.358 --> 00:24:14.460
Males have the job of finding
and gaining access to females.

00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:18.048
They have basically two
strategies.

00:24:18.048 --> 00:24:21.368
One is to let their sperms
compete.

00:24:21.368 --> 00:24:25.328
In that case they make just
more and better sperm,

00:24:25.328 --> 00:24:30.398
and the sexual system in a
species like that will be

00:24:30.398 --> 00:24:33.615
promiscuous,
that the females will mate with

00:24:33.615 --> 00:24:36.913
many males,
they'll have a lot of semen in

00:24:36.913 --> 00:24:41.315
their vagina,
or spermatheca or sac for this,

00:24:41.315 --> 00:24:46.338
and then the sperms will
compete with each other.

00:24:46.338 --> 00:24:49.150
Some scientists believe that in
humans also,

00:24:49.150 --> 00:24:52.640
we have a variety of sperm,
including killer sperm,

00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:56.868
and other kinds of sperm that
go in and facilitate this.

00:24:56.868 --> 00:24:59.938
These killer sperm are supposed
to kill sperm that have a

00:24:59.938 --> 00:25:02.458
different genotype,
and it's very controversial

00:25:02.458 --> 00:25:04.538
about whether this is true or
not.

00:25:04.538 --> 00:25:08.358
The data starts when you look
at sperm they have--human

00:25:08.358 --> 00:25:11.259
sperm--they have very different
shapes.

00:25:11.259 --> 00:25:14.145
And one version is,
well, all these other shapes

00:25:14.145 --> 00:25:16.233
are just damaged,
they're just bad,

00:25:16.233 --> 00:25:19.980
they're not effective and
there's some evidence for that.

00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:24.144
The other story is that,
no, these are doing different

00:25:24.144 --> 00:25:27.758
jobs then fertilization,
and it's a hot area of

00:25:27.758 --> 00:25:28.778
research.
 

00:25:28.778 --> 00:25:32.278
That's strategy Number One,
to engage in sperm competition,

00:25:32.278 --> 00:25:38.210
and you'll see if we get time
that in our related species,

00:25:38.210 --> 00:25:42.175
Bonobos, chimps,
our group of species generally

00:25:42.175 --> 00:25:44.848
engages in sperm competition.
 

00:25:44.848 --> 00:25:48.361
What you get is very large
testes, so you can determine

00:25:48.361 --> 00:25:52.394
this by taking the measure--the
weight of testes--as a fraction

00:25:52.394 --> 00:25:54.019
of total body weight.
 

00:25:54.019 --> 00:25:57.229
If it's very large,
you know there's sperm

00:25:57.229 --> 00:25:59.029
competition going on.
 

00:25:59.029 --> 00:26:02.702
The other strategy of course is
males can compete with each

00:26:02.702 --> 00:26:04.920
other for control of the
females.

00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:09.078
This happens of course in
motile--motile animals--

00:26:09.078 --> 00:26:12.253
sperm competition is the
original thing where you spew

00:26:12.253 --> 00:26:15.250
zillions of sperms and then the
best ones find--

00:26:15.250 --> 00:26:17.769
are the ones that find the
females,

00:26:17.769 --> 00:26:21.054
but once they're motile,
the males can come into contact

00:26:21.054 --> 00:26:24.577
with each other and they can
fight in some way and control a

00:26:24.577 --> 00:26:26.250
territory, for instance.
 

00:26:26.250 --> 00:26:30.413
Coral reef fish control
territories in the coral and the

00:26:30.413 --> 00:26:34.198
females cruise around,
find a male who's got a good

00:26:34.198 --> 00:26:37.529
territory, then come and mate
with them.

00:26:37.529 --> 00:26:41.549
Well generally the males will
actually fight with each other

00:26:41.549 --> 00:26:45.501
for dominance and then use that
dominance to gain access to

00:26:45.501 --> 00:26:46.318
females.
 

00:26:46.318 --> 00:26:48.930
How does this--what are some
examples of how this all works

00:26:48.930 --> 00:26:49.200
out?
 

00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:53.130
The females have also two basic
strategies.

00:26:53.130 --> 00:26:59.491
One is to get the males to
provide resources other than

00:26:59.491 --> 00:27:07.150
sperm, and those resources allow
her to build big healthy eggs.

00:27:07.150 --> 00:27:11.657
One of the really cute examples
of this is in the jungle,

00:27:11.657 --> 00:27:15.038
protein, nitrogen,
is very, very scarce.

00:27:15.038 --> 00:27:18.436
The soils are thin and the
rains wash everything away so

00:27:18.436 --> 00:27:20.598
it's really hard to get
nitrogen.

00:27:20.598 --> 00:27:23.220
Guess what's a great source of
nitrogen?

00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:24.210
Dung.
 

00:27:24.210 --> 00:27:28.098
Any animal takes a dump in the
rain forest, immediately there's

00:27:28.098 --> 00:27:31.738
all kinds of--especially insects
that come and are going to

00:27:31.738 --> 00:27:33.369
utilize that nitrogen.
 

00:27:33.369 --> 00:27:35.390
It's a really scarce resource.
 

00:27:35.390 --> 00:27:39.288
Beetles have--are ones that are
very good at this and there's a

00:27:39.288 --> 00:27:42.119
whole group of beetles called
dung beetles.

00:27:42.119 --> 00:27:43.308
What do they do?
 

00:27:43.308 --> 00:27:47.077
They--as soon as they detect
this--by odor probably,

00:27:47.077 --> 00:27:51.067
they come in and start rolling
it up into little balls,

00:27:51.067 --> 00:27:53.950
because it's much too big for
them.

00:27:53.950 --> 00:28:05.410
Let me show you a picture
of--this is a dung beetle,

00:28:05.410 --> 00:28:07.009
and what he has done--there's a
big pad--

00:28:07.009 --> 00:28:12.261
a big animal pad nearby and
he's cut off with his cutting

00:28:12.261 --> 00:28:16.153
claws this big ball,
and that's what he's going to

00:28:16.153 --> 00:28:17.410
present to a female.
 

00:28:17.410 --> 00:28:20.190
A whole lot of dung beetles
come in,

00:28:20.190 --> 00:28:23.133
they make these balls,
then in the species I'm talking

00:28:23.133 --> 00:28:26.520
about they put it on their back
and sort of parade around with

00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:26.910
it.
 

00:28:26.910 --> 00:28:30.775
Meanwhile, the females are on
the outside, and they're

00:28:30.775 --> 00:28:34.859
watching all this go on and what
males do they choose?

00:28:34.859 --> 00:28:38.578
The ones with the biggest balls.
 

00:28:38.578 --> 00:28:45.420
She wants resources and that's
her resource.

00:28:45.420 --> 00:28:51.108
Now the most extreme case of
this is in praying mantises.

00:28:51.108 --> 00:28:54.297
So a praying mantis is a
beautiful animal,

00:28:54.297 --> 00:28:57.017
as you may know,
here's one of them,

00:28:57.017 --> 00:28:59.348
but they're very solitary.
 

00:28:59.348 --> 00:29:01.950
They have to actually catch
insects.

00:29:01.950 --> 00:29:04.968
They sit on the ends of
branches and--with these

00:29:04.968 --> 00:29:07.792
claws--and they wait for an
insect to fly by,

00:29:07.792 --> 00:29:10.170
and then they grab it and eat
it.

00:29:10.170 --> 00:29:13.089
It's not an easy way to make
your living.

00:29:13.089 --> 00:29:14.914
They're poised;
they're very quiet,

00:29:14.914 --> 00:29:16.868
and they want to capture a
meal.

00:29:16.868 --> 00:29:19.568
They have just a few
milliseconds of something

00:29:19.568 --> 00:29:20.348
buzzing by.
 

00:29:20.348 --> 00:29:24.299
Now a male comes up and wants
to mate with this female but

00:29:24.299 --> 00:29:27.419
she's ready to eat,
so he's got the problem of

00:29:27.419 --> 00:29:30.328
approaching her and not getting
eaten.

00:29:30.328 --> 00:29:36.029
In evolution they sometimes get
eaten and that has led to a very

00:29:36.029 --> 00:29:40.009
interesting form of reproductive
strategy.

00:29:40.009 --> 00:29:44.202
That what you see is that the
male will come on and you can

00:29:44.202 --> 00:29:48.683
see--now that's the male on top
and look how much smaller he is

00:29:48.683 --> 00:29:50.130
then the female.
 

00:29:50.130 --> 00:29:52.616
In many species the male is
bigger, but he's smaller,

00:29:52.616 --> 00:29:55.391
and that's a sign that the
males are not fighting with each

00:29:55.391 --> 00:29:55.868
other.
 

00:29:55.868 --> 00:29:57.878
You'll see later that if the
male is bigger that means

00:29:57.878 --> 00:29:59.700
they're--almost always means
they're fighting.

00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:01.647
She's big because he only has
to make sperm,

00:30:01.647 --> 00:30:02.690
she has to make eggs.
 

00:30:02.690 --> 00:30:08.470
Notice he has his head still
on, she has her head on.

00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:11.020
That's the way it starts,
and you think that something

00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:13.621
normal is going to take place,
when actually in fact,

00:30:13.621 --> 00:30:15.230
she reaches around and grabs
him,

00:30:15.230 --> 00:30:16.410
she's bigger and stronger than
him,

00:30:16.410 --> 00:30:20.548
pulls him off and starts eating
his head.

00:30:20.548 --> 00:30:24.387
What then happens is she allows
him to go back,

00:30:24.387 --> 00:30:28.059
but now you can see she's still
got her head,

00:30:28.059 --> 00:30:30.230
there's no head there.
 

00:30:30.230 --> 00:30:33.740
The way the insect nervous
system is put out;

00:30:33.740 --> 00:30:38.058
all the circuits to coordinate
the copulation are down here.

00:30:38.058 --> 00:30:41.170
What the head actually does is
inhibit that,

00:30:41.170 --> 00:30:43.308
unless it goes and says--well
most situations--

00:30:43.308 --> 00:30:45.450
no this isn't right to start
copulating,

00:30:45.450 --> 00:30:48.358
but only in the very special
situation where it's a female,

00:30:48.358 --> 00:30:53.090
when she eats off his head that
releases those circuits from

00:30:53.090 --> 00:30:56.940
inhibition and he copulates her
to completion.

00:30:56.940 --> 00:31:00.265
Now--and then she can--when
he's done she can eat the rest

00:31:00.265 --> 00:31:00.788
of him.
 

00:31:00.788 --> 00:31:05.771
Now what's really interesting
is--and he doesn't object,

00:31:05.771 --> 00:31:08.400
he doesn't try to get away.
 

00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:10.450
What's going on?
 

00:31:10.450 --> 00:31:14.890
The key thing is that this is a
sparse species.

00:31:14.890 --> 00:31:18.078
How many of you have seen a
praying mantis?

00:31:18.078 --> 00:31:21.048
How many of you have seen a lot
of praying mantis?

00:31:21.048 --> 00:31:23.410
One person, you must study them
or something.

00:31:23.410 --> 00:31:25.230
They're not hard--they're not
easy to find,

00:31:25.230 --> 00:31:26.400
there's not many of them.
 

00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:29.624
If a male is lucky enough to
find a female and get in this

00:31:29.624 --> 00:31:31.384
situation,
man he's in heaven,

00:31:31.384 --> 00:31:34.622
and it's unlikely if he leaves
her he's going to find another

00:31:34.622 --> 00:31:35.000
one.
 

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:36.759
That's just an unlikely event.
 

00:31:36.759 --> 00:31:39.440
How does he maximize his
reproduction?

00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:43.007
Well in my one chance I've got
to have that female produce as

00:31:43.007 --> 00:31:46.368
many eggs with my genes in it,
so he wants her to produce a

00:31:46.368 --> 00:31:48.994
lot of big,
very healthy eggs and so his

00:31:48.994 --> 00:31:52.785
body is the food for her,
including a lot of protein so

00:31:52.785 --> 00:31:55.318
that she can make a whole lot of
eggs.

00:31:55.318 --> 00:31:59.429
In evolution it's worked out
that males who sacrifice their

00:31:59.429 --> 00:32:03.608
bodies to this have more
offspring then males who don't,

00:32:03.608 --> 00:32:07.244
so you see the evolution from
him being prey just because he's

00:32:07.244 --> 00:32:11.058
prey to it being an actual part
of the whole sexual situation.

00:32:11.058 --> 00:32:14.000
The next time someone tells you
that evolution is the survival

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:15.976
of the fittest,
what are you going to tell

00:32:15.976 --> 00:32:16.410
them?
 

00:32:16.410 --> 00:32:20.397
Fitness has--survival has
nothing to do with the price of

00:32:20.397 --> 00:32:21.039
cheese.
 

00:32:21.039 --> 00:32:25.608
That's only one of the ways.
 

00:32:25.608 --> 00:32:30.009
Now, the next strategy of
females--

00:32:30.009 --> 00:32:34.027
the first is to get resources,
the second strategy is for

00:32:34.027 --> 00:32:38.473
females to try to find the male
with the best genes and so that

00:32:38.473 --> 00:32:42.535
she--
her offspring have good genes

00:32:42.535 --> 00:32:45.480
and are very successful.
 

00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:50.145
There's a whole lot of aspects
to this and one is she has to be

00:32:50.145 --> 00:32:54.210
able to control which male is
fertilizing her genes.

00:32:54.210 --> 00:32:57.445
The more separated the male and
the female, when you spew out

00:32:57.445 --> 00:33:00.788
into the ocean eggs and sperm
there's no control whatsoever.

00:33:00.788 --> 00:33:06.278
The closer that you come--the
male and the female come to each

00:33:06.278 --> 00:33:10.328
other the more control that the
female has.

00:33:10.328 --> 00:33:15.327
One of the interesting ways of
looking at this is internal

00:33:15.327 --> 00:33:17.960
fertilization,
as in humans.

00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:24.450
It is among other things a
strategy for female control.

00:33:24.450 --> 00:33:27.820
Internal fertilization and
internal growth of the fetus has

00:33:27.820 --> 00:33:29.098
a lot of advantages.
 

00:33:29.098 --> 00:33:31.752
It protects the fetus,
allows the mother to provide

00:33:31.752 --> 00:33:33.875
nutrition and waste removal
continuously,

00:33:33.875 --> 00:33:34.298
etc.
 

00:33:34.298 --> 00:33:40.910
There are also these aspects to
the female control strategy.

00:33:40.910 --> 00:33:44.363
Generally, if a female won't
allow a mating,

00:33:44.363 --> 00:33:45.970
it doesn't happen.
 

00:33:45.970 --> 00:33:48.259
If a female doesn't allow it
then rape has to happen.

00:33:48.259 --> 00:33:50.490
We'll talk about rape later.
 

00:33:50.490 --> 00:33:53.855
In humans, as you know,
females have a vulva and that's

00:33:53.855 --> 00:33:55.538
the Latin word for valve.
 

00:33:55.538 --> 00:33:58.104
She can open it,
she can close it,

00:33:58.104 --> 00:34:00.278
and that's the whole idea.
 

00:34:00.278 --> 00:34:05.117
If the female wants to mate she
gets excited and she lubricates,

00:34:05.117 --> 00:34:08.496
and the purpose of the
lubrication is to ease

00:34:08.496 --> 00:34:11.570
penetration and ease the sexual
act.

00:34:11.570 --> 00:34:15.257
Behaviorally she's also--aside
from the beginning she's

00:34:15.257 --> 00:34:18.056
receptive, she assumes the
proper posture,

00:34:18.056 --> 00:34:20.380
and everything goes just fine.
 

00:34:20.380 --> 00:34:22.505
But if these things--if she
doesn't want to do it and these

00:34:22.505 --> 00:34:24.574
things don't happen,
there's no lubrication,

00:34:24.574 --> 00:34:27.288
there's no assumption of the
proper posture which is

00:34:27.288 --> 00:34:29.469
necessary for internal
fertilization,

00:34:29.469 --> 00:34:34.981
then it's very hard for the
male to intermit and probably

00:34:34.981 --> 00:34:38.329
sexual intercourse won't happen.
 

00:34:38.329 --> 00:34:40.858
In a real rape,
say among humans,

00:34:40.858 --> 00:34:45.597
the vagina does not lubricate,
and that's why there's so much

00:34:45.597 --> 00:34:49.389
lacerating and tearing of the
vaginal walls.

00:34:49.389 --> 00:34:53.125
That's why it's so dangerous
because it's part of the human

00:34:53.125 --> 00:34:57.052
female strategy to control what
males inseminate her is to not

00:34:57.052 --> 00:35:01.289
lubricate,
but if she's forced there can

00:35:01.289 --> 00:35:04.900
be a lot of damage done to her.
 

00:35:04.900 --> 00:35:08.425
How does a female know which
male has the best genes,

00:35:08.425 --> 00:35:11.139
which male to allow to
inseminate her?

00:35:11.139 --> 00:35:14.981
She has to either watch a
competition or see the male in

00:35:14.981 --> 00:35:17.108
some way,
or know the outcome of some

00:35:17.108 --> 00:35:18.780
competition that she doesn't
see,

00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:23.909
by say, detecting a male's
position in a status hierarchy.

00:35:23.909 --> 00:35:25.865
In some birds,
like flamingos,

00:35:25.865 --> 00:35:29.643
there's a beautiful movie of
flamingos doing this which I

00:35:29.643 --> 00:35:33.851
don't have time to show,
there can be 100 or so males

00:35:33.851 --> 00:35:36.989
can gather together and start
dancing.

00:35:36.989 --> 00:35:39.358
It's what's called a lek,
and many of you may have heard

00:35:39.358 --> 00:35:41.469
of it or seen it in National
Geographic movies.

00:35:41.469 --> 00:35:43.980
The males dance back and forth,
back and forth,

00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:46.981
they show their coordination,
they show how perfect their

00:35:46.981 --> 00:35:49.318
feathers are,
they show their stamina because

00:35:49.318 --> 00:35:51.369
they're doing this for quite a
long time,

00:35:51.369 --> 00:35:54.331
and again, the females stand
around on the outside and try to

00:35:54.331 --> 00:35:56.159
notice a male who's a good
dancer,

00:35:56.159 --> 00:35:59.400
a good strong well coordinated
dancer,

00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:02.650
and then she chooses him and
goes off and mates.

00:36:02.650 --> 00:36:08.275
By choosing these males that
are not creeping around,

00:36:08.275 --> 00:36:14.768
she presumes that she's getting
a male with a good--with good

00:36:14.768 --> 00:36:15.849
genes.
 

00:36:15.849 --> 00:36:24.211
Another way that the females
get to choose a good male is by

00:36:24.211 --> 00:36:30.615
choosing males who have--
in species where males fight as

00:36:30.615 --> 00:36:35.518
part of male strategy then the
females choose the winners.

00:36:35.518 --> 00:36:37.664
Males may fight,
and you set up a dominance

00:36:37.664 --> 00:36:39.536
hierarchy,
but there's nothing that says

00:36:39.536 --> 00:36:41.159
the female has to choose the top
dog,

00:36:41.159 --> 00:36:44.130
maybe she wants to choose the
middle dog or a bottom dog,

00:36:44.130 --> 00:36:47.518
but in general in species,
females choose the top dog.

00:36:47.518 --> 00:36:52.146
They know the result of--in a
variety of ways--the dominance

00:36:52.146 --> 00:36:56.070
fights, and the female then
chooses the top dog.

00:36:56.070 --> 00:37:00.050
In the male fights,
the winner gets the female,

00:37:00.050 --> 00:37:05.072
or maybe gets the whole harem
of females, and the loser may

00:37:05.072 --> 00:37:07.409
get absolutely nothing.
 

00:37:07.409 --> 00:37:10.980
Well the females are very happy
to join the winner's harem.

00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:12.699
Why is that?
 

00:37:12.699 --> 00:37:16.753
Because once that starts in a
species that means that male has

00:37:16.753 --> 00:37:20.010
some genes which allow him to
win these fights.

00:37:20.010 --> 00:37:22.150
He's big, he's strong,
he's vicious,

00:37:22.150 --> 00:37:25.139
he has sharp teeth,
he's a violent character,

00:37:25.139 --> 00:37:29.465
and therefore he is successful
in these battles and the female

00:37:29.465 --> 00:37:32.688
wants her young to also--
wants being in this

00:37:32.688 --> 00:37:36.480
evolutionary sense of if she
does that she passes on her

00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:38.913
genes--
the female wants her offspring

00:37:38.913 --> 00:37:42.460
to have these characteristics of
being able to win a fight,

00:37:42.460 --> 00:37:44.360
i.e., of being very violent.
 

00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:46.800
She will choose the most
violent male,

00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:51.264
the winner of these battles to
father her children because then

00:37:51.264 --> 00:37:53.943
they--
then the odds are that they

00:37:53.943 --> 00:37:57.920
will also become these big,
strong, violent males.

00:37:57.920 --> 00:37:59.969
What happens,
in this case,

00:37:59.969 --> 00:38:04.701
is in evolution males may start
fighting and once the females

00:38:04.701 --> 00:38:09.275
select the fighter's then both
male and female reproductive

00:38:09.275 --> 00:38:13.927
strategy colludes in increasing
the violence a little bit in

00:38:13.927 --> 00:38:15.900
every generation.
 

00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:20.628
It's very interesting that
males and females are colluding

00:38:20.628 --> 00:38:24.280
in the evolution of male on male
violence.

00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:26.070
What else does evolution do?
 

00:38:26.070 --> 00:38:29.722
Well if the males are fighting
each other and reproductive

00:38:29.722 --> 00:38:33.757
success depends on winning these
fights, then males will tend to

00:38:33.757 --> 00:38:34.719
get larger.
 

00:38:34.719 --> 00:38:38.409
You get a large male,
humans, chimpanzees,

00:38:38.409 --> 00:38:43.360
males larger than the female,
and that helps them in the

00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:44.349
fights.
 

00:38:44.349 --> 00:38:49.112
It also opens up a second
strategy for reproductive

00:38:49.112 --> 00:38:51.579
success--
a second strategy for

00:38:51.579 --> 00:38:55.902
reproductive success and that is
that the male is now bigger than

00:38:55.902 --> 00:38:59.349
the female and he can start
coercing the female.

00:38:59.349 --> 00:39:02.309
He may not have to fight the
males;

00:39:02.309 --> 00:39:08.173
he can just coerce,
fight with and coerce this

00:39:08.173 --> 00:39:10.389
smaller female.
 

00:39:10.389 --> 00:39:12.110
Then guess what happens?
 

00:39:12.110 --> 00:39:16.657
If that gets into a species
that the males start coercing

00:39:16.657 --> 00:39:20.880
the females, what is an
evolutionarily wise female to

00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:21.449
do?
 

00:39:21.449 --> 00:39:25.710
She chooses a male who is most
successful at coercing females,

00:39:25.710 --> 00:39:28.505
because again,
her children will then inherit

00:39:28.505 --> 00:39:32.000
those genes which will allow
them to successfully coerce

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:34.922
females and get more
reproduction and have more

00:39:34.922 --> 00:39:35.940
offspring.
 

00:39:35.940 --> 00:39:40.597
Again, we see that not only are
male and female reproductive

00:39:40.597 --> 00:39:44.704
strategies cooperating in an
increase in male on male

00:39:44.704 --> 00:39:47.978
violence,
they also cooperate in

00:39:47.978 --> 00:39:51.530
increasing male on female
violence.

00:39:51.530 --> 00:39:55.735
It's really quite an
interesting way of looking at

00:39:55.735 --> 00:40:00.797
things and explains--starts to
explain some of this violence

00:40:00.797 --> 00:40:04.059
that we see in human
interactions.

00:40:04.059 --> 00:40:08.556
Now the great--we belong to the
great ape line of evolution,

00:40:08.556 --> 00:40:13.204
and it seems that our line of
evolution seems to specialize in

00:40:13.204 --> 00:40:15.340
male on female violence.
 

00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:18.041
Consider rape,
so a lot of political

00:40:18.041 --> 00:40:22.516
correctness about use of the
word rape, but I'm going to do

00:40:22.516 --> 00:40:25.449
it in a straight biological
sense.

00:40:25.449 --> 00:40:29.139
Rape is the coercion of an
unwilling female into

00:40:29.139 --> 00:40:30.239
intercourse.
 

00:40:30.239 --> 00:40:33.949
Outside of mammals there are
only a very few species where

00:40:33.949 --> 00:40:34.860
rape occurs.
 

00:40:34.860 --> 00:40:38.719
Scorpion flies are one of the
best known examples.

00:40:38.719 --> 00:40:42.726
Normal sex occurs when a male
offers a female a dead insect or

00:40:42.726 --> 00:40:45.733
other food mass;
she's getting resources from

00:40:45.733 --> 00:40:46.059
him.
 

00:40:46.059 --> 00:40:52.257
After she accepts she allows
copulation to proceed,

00:40:52.257 --> 00:40:55.110
and it goes smoothly.
 

00:40:55.110 --> 00:40:57.483
Sometimes, however,
sex happens in quite a

00:40:57.483 --> 00:40:58.409
different way.
 

00:40:58.409 --> 00:41:02.248
A male without an offering can
ambush the female and she

00:41:02.248 --> 00:41:05.739
clearly is trying to escape and
the whole time,

00:41:05.739 --> 00:41:08.670
he's got genital claspers to
try to grab onto her,

00:41:08.670 --> 00:41:12.219
and she's trying to get away
and push him away,

00:41:12.219 --> 00:41:13.309
fly away.
 

00:41:13.309 --> 00:41:16.480
In your reading,
there's a description of this

00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:20.425
rape of scorpion flies so I
don't have to go further with

00:41:20.425 --> 00:41:20.920
it.
 

00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:25.030
In vertebrates,
rapes occur in several species

00:41:25.030 --> 00:41:30.239
of ducks and in mammals there
are only three species where

00:41:30.239 --> 00:41:33.070
rape is routine:
elephant seals,

00:41:33.070 --> 00:41:35.630
orangutans and humans.
 

00:41:35.630 --> 00:41:39.244
Rape occurs occasionally in
three other mammal species:

00:41:39.244 --> 00:41:41.856
chimpanzees,
howler monkeys and gorillas

00:41:41.856 --> 00:41:46.110
when they're captive;
it has not been observed in the

00:41:46.110 --> 00:41:46.610
wild.
 

00:41:46.610 --> 00:41:48.969
This is really quite striking.
 

00:41:48.969 --> 00:41:53.184
Of the six species,
mammalian species,

00:41:53.184 --> 00:41:59.221
in which rape has been
observed, five of those are the

00:41:59.221 --> 00:42:01.500
great--are apes.
 

00:42:01.500 --> 00:42:07.144
I'm sorry one is a monkey--of
the five species of primates

00:42:07.144 --> 00:42:12.889
where rape's been observed,
four are great apes like us.

00:42:12.889 --> 00:42:16.739
Those statistics are way out of
the range of chance.

00:42:16.739 --> 00:42:21.525
There is something special
about ape evolution that has led

00:42:21.525 --> 00:42:26.228
to this emphasis on violent
relationship between males and

00:42:26.228 --> 00:42:27.219
females.
 

00:42:27.219 --> 00:42:32.250
Most likely it is the extreme
unavailability of eggs,

00:42:32.250 --> 00:42:36.722
so it's an extremely rare--in
the great apes it's extremely

00:42:36.722 --> 00:42:41.273
rare to find a female who has an
egg ready to be fertilized,

00:42:41.273 --> 00:42:41.889
why?
 

00:42:41.889 --> 00:42:46.559
Well first, primates take many
years to become sexually mature.

00:42:46.559 --> 00:42:52.159
In chimps and humans it's
around 12 to 13 years before a

00:42:52.159 --> 00:42:55.010
female can ovulate an egg.
 

00:42:55.010 --> 00:42:58.268
Then primate mothers have these
long gestation periods,

00:42:58.268 --> 00:43:01.690
eight months in chimps,
nine months in humans,

00:43:01.690 --> 00:43:04.364
and so just counting gestation
and the recovery from

00:43:04.364 --> 00:43:06.655
childbirth,
females can have at most one

00:43:06.655 --> 00:43:09.914
young a year,
which means one egg available

00:43:09.914 --> 00:43:12.840
for fertilization in a whole
year.

00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:16.197
Then the females lactate and
you probably know about

00:43:16.197 --> 00:43:20.215
lactational amenorrhea that when
a female is lactating and the

00:43:20.215 --> 00:43:25.235
baby is sucking on the nipple,
hormones are released and the

00:43:25.235 --> 00:43:29.489
female does not lactate--
does not ovulate again.

00:43:29.489 --> 00:43:33.349
The average for a chimpanzee is
about another four years in

00:43:33.349 --> 00:43:37.467
which the female feeds--
breastfeeds the infant and so

00:43:37.467 --> 00:43:40.679
she doesn't come into fertility
again.

00:43:40.679 --> 00:43:44.570
Then they can sometimes stay
with their young even longer

00:43:44.570 --> 00:43:48.599
time, so the average birth
interval for chimpanzees is five

00:43:48.599 --> 00:43:50.059
and a half years.
 

00:43:50.059 --> 00:43:53.614
That means for any female
there's one egg every five and a

00:43:53.614 --> 00:43:55.860
half years ready to be
fertilized.

00:43:55.860 --> 00:44:00.527
That's Jane Goodall's number,
a Japanese group says it's six

00:44:00.527 --> 00:44:02.760
years,
for orangutans it's eight

00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:06.291
years, and gorilla females have
a baby about once every ten

00:44:06.291 --> 00:44:06.840
years.
 

00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:13.090
There's an extreme dearth of
eggs to get fertilized.

00:44:13.090 --> 00:44:14.980
You have a chimp community,
there's say 40,

00:44:14.980 --> 00:44:18.329
45-55 individuals,
something like that,

00:44:18.329 --> 00:44:20.739
maybe 10 or 12--this is a big
community--

00:44:20.739 --> 00:44:24.505
10 or 12 sexually mature males,
about the same number of

00:44:24.505 --> 00:44:28.621
females,
non-mature males and females,

00:44:28.621 --> 00:44:32.632
and of those then,
given the very long period,

00:44:32.632 --> 00:44:36.396
there's probably going to be
one or two females in that whole

00:44:36.396 --> 00:44:40.286
year who are going to be fertile
and in estrus and ready to get

00:44:40.286 --> 00:44:41.289
fertilized.
 

00:44:41.289 --> 00:44:43.867
These males spend the whole
year, in terms of their

00:44:43.867 --> 00:44:47.445
reproductive evolution,
spend the whole year setting

00:44:47.445 --> 00:44:51.668
themselves up to have that one--
to inseminate that one egg

00:44:51.668 --> 00:44:53.929
that's available in that whole
year.

00:44:53.929 --> 00:44:58.197
You can imagine there's going
to be a huge amount of

00:44:58.197 --> 00:45:02.969
competition, a huge amount of
violence among the males.

00:45:02.969 --> 00:45:09.048
As we've seen that male/male
violence then spills over into

00:45:09.048 --> 00:45:11.460
male/female violence.
 

00:45:11.460 --> 00:45:16.510
Within this group--we belong to
an order called primates,

00:45:16.510 --> 00:45:19.990
as you know,
and within this group monkeys

00:45:19.990 --> 00:45:25.255
are fairly distant relatives but
the rest of the great apes are

00:45:25.255 --> 00:45:26.699
fairly close.
 

00:45:26.699 --> 00:45:30.682
You can see there are a lot of
similarities,

00:45:30.682 --> 00:45:36.056
these are some jokes about the
singles bar, even in biology

00:45:36.056 --> 00:45:40.039
there's some sense of humor
still left.

00:45:40.039 --> 00:45:44.891
Now, this is another professor
at Yale and I always ask

00:45:44.891 --> 00:45:49.565
students--you have too many
advisees--so I asked them

00:45:49.565 --> 00:45:53.070
wouldn't you rather go to this
guy?

00:45:53.070 --> 00:45:56.869
He looks very fatherly and kind
and everything.

00:45:56.869 --> 00:45:58.489
Well that's an orangutan.
 

00:45:58.489 --> 00:46:03.043
Of the great apes,
it's as far a distance from

00:46:03.043 --> 00:46:06.282
humans as--
the most distant species and

00:46:06.282 --> 00:46:10.773
yet looks pretty much--
you can empathize with that as

00:46:10.773 --> 00:46:12.860
almost a human being.
 

00:46:12.860 --> 00:46:16.838
It doesn't take a lot of
evolution to go between these

00:46:16.838 --> 00:46:17.289
two.
 

00:46:17.289 --> 00:46:22.090
There are five species of great
apes.

00:46:22.090 --> 00:46:26.070
That's a young guy.
 

00:46:26.070 --> 00:46:30.242
This is a time scale,
about 15 million years ago

00:46:30.242 --> 00:46:35.657
there was one line of evolution
coming up from a long time ago

00:46:35.657 --> 00:46:41.340
and the first event was that
orangutans split off the tree,

00:46:41.340 --> 00:46:44.289
that the tree split and one
branch became orangutans.

00:46:44.289 --> 00:46:47.898
Then about ten million years
ago another--there was another

00:46:47.898 --> 00:46:51.320
split and gorillas went off,
a group went off and became

00:46:51.320 --> 00:46:52.130
gorillas.
 

00:46:52.130 --> 00:46:56.257
Then about six million years
ago another group came off and

00:46:56.257 --> 00:46:58.179
they evolved into humans.
 

00:46:58.179 --> 00:47:02.469
The most recent split is about
two million years ago and gave

00:47:02.469 --> 00:47:05.972
two species, very similar
species: chimpanzees and

00:47:05.972 --> 00:47:06.829
Bonobos.
 

00:47:06.829 --> 00:47:10.650
The farther distant the split
is the more there's been time to

00:47:10.650 --> 00:47:13.762
evolve differently,
so an orangutan who as that

00:47:13.762 --> 00:47:18.307
nice guy,
is very distant from the other

00:47:18.307 --> 00:47:19.460
species.
 

00:47:19.460 --> 00:47:27.059
That's our family tree and the
difference--this is a fairly

00:47:27.059 --> 00:47:29.679
recent split here.
 

00:47:29.679 --> 00:47:33.208
The genetic difference between
these three species,

00:47:33.208 --> 00:47:37.230
between any pair of those three
species, is about 1.5%.

00:47:37.230 --> 00:47:41.056
If you draw out the DNA
sequence for a chimpanzee and a

00:47:41.056 --> 00:47:43.610
human and look at the base
pairs,

00:47:43.610 --> 00:47:47.422
out of every hundred,
98 or 99 will be identical and

00:47:47.422 --> 00:47:49.739
one or two will be different.
 

00:47:49.739 --> 00:47:55.590
We're extremely similar
genetically.

00:47:55.590 --> 00:47:58.010
Now, what does this difference
mean?

00:47:58.010 --> 00:48:01.460
1.5% or 2%, we don't have the
foggiest idea of what it means.

00:48:01.460 --> 00:48:04.010
Obviously, you can look at a
chimpanzee and say,

00:48:04.010 --> 00:48:06.204
hey it isn't human,
and their behavior is different

00:48:06.204 --> 00:48:08.900
and they can't speak,
and all kinds of things,

00:48:08.900 --> 00:48:12.590
but genetically there's not
that big of a difference.

00:48:12.590 --> 00:48:16.257
I wouldn't draw any particular
conclusions from the genetics

00:48:16.257 --> 00:48:16.630
yet.
 

00:48:16.630 --> 00:48:21.597
This is a rapidly evolving
field and we're going to learn

00:48:21.597 --> 00:48:25.722
an awful lot very quickly,
and one doesn't know what the

00:48:25.722 --> 00:48:27.920
conclusions are going to turn
out to be.

00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:31.570
One thing which may be solid is
that if you look between a man--

00:48:31.570 --> 00:48:36.248
females have two X chromosomes
and males have an X and Y

00:48:36.248 --> 00:48:38.108
chromosome,
so you can ask,

00:48:38.108 --> 00:48:40.469
well what is the genetic
distance between a human male

00:48:40.469 --> 00:48:41.449
and a human female?
 

00:48:41.449 --> 00:48:46.289
Guess what, 1.5%.
 

00:48:46.289 --> 00:48:49.030
Whatever you think of the
difference,

00:48:49.030 --> 00:48:52.353
genetic distance of those
species, you pretty much at this

00:48:52.353 --> 00:48:55.795
current stage of our knowledge
have to think the same as the

00:48:55.795 --> 00:48:59.469
genetic difference between a
human male and a human female.

00:48:59.469 --> 00:49:05.570
That's just for your thinking.
 

00:49:05.570 --> 00:49:11.070
Each of the great ape species
has evolved a different social

00:49:11.070 --> 00:49:14.239
system to organize reproduction.
 

00:49:14.239 --> 00:49:18.159
All but one have an awful lot
of violence associated with it.

00:49:18.159 --> 00:49:21.800
Orangutans are the least social
of apes.

00:49:21.800 --> 00:49:26.661
The males and females generally
stay apart, and the mother and a

00:49:26.661 --> 00:49:29.750
child are the only stable social
unit.

00:49:29.750 --> 00:49:33.154
The offspring stay with the
mother until adolescence,

00:49:33.154 --> 00:49:37.280
very much like the chimpanzee
story and like the human story.

00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:41.130
It's about ten years before the
young separates.

00:49:41.130 --> 00:49:43.701
For most of the eight years
between births,

00:49:43.701 --> 00:49:46.273
the mother has no interest in
males at all,

00:49:46.273 --> 00:49:50.974
no interest in sex at all;
she doesn't really come very

00:49:50.974 --> 00:49:52.510
close to them.
 

00:49:52.510 --> 00:49:54.349
There are two kinds of
orangutan males.

00:49:54.349 --> 00:49:56.989
There's a large one and a small
one.

00:49:56.989 --> 00:50:01.219
The big males are about 200
pounds, the females and the

00:50:01.219 --> 00:50:05.920
small males are less than half
that size, about 90 pounds.

00:50:05.920 --> 00:50:10.742
The small male develops
normally up to adolescence and

00:50:10.742 --> 00:50:14.110
then just stops developing
further.

00:50:14.110 --> 00:50:17.889
Doesn't develop the
characteristics of the full

00:50:17.889 --> 00:50:21.668
male, doesn't grow a beard,
crests of the hair,

00:50:21.668 --> 00:50:23.639
throat pouches,
etc.

00:50:23.639 --> 00:50:26.320
They remain looking like
adolescents.

00:50:26.320 --> 00:50:28.396
But, they are completely
fertile, have a normal

00:50:28.396 --> 00:50:31.184
complement of testosterone,
they're sexually totally

00:50:31.184 --> 00:50:34.771
capable, and they can stay in
this adolescent stage for up to

00:50:34.771 --> 00:50:37.114
18 years,
maybe longer but that's the

00:50:37.114 --> 00:50:39.199
most that anyone has observed
them.

00:50:39.199 --> 00:50:43.510
They probably don't grow into a
big male until the dominant male

00:50:43.510 --> 00:50:47.480
in the region has died or is too
weak to defend himself.

00:50:47.480 --> 00:50:51.851
The females always want
to--When they have a choice they

00:50:51.851 --> 00:50:56.860
always want to mate with the big
males because the big males are

00:50:56.860 --> 00:51:00.126
more successful,
and it's the old story that

00:51:00.126 --> 00:51:03.672
females mate with males of a
type that are already successful

00:51:03.672 --> 00:51:07.219
because that is good for the
genes that her children get.

00:51:07.219 --> 00:51:11.248
In the mating between a female
and a big male,

00:51:11.248 --> 00:51:15.186
sex is very relaxed,
it takes on a languorous

00:51:15.186 --> 00:51:20.289
quality, an erotic quality,
there's not a great rush.

00:51:20.289 --> 00:51:24.628
Matings can begin with oral or
manual manipulation of the

00:51:24.628 --> 00:51:27.773
partner's genitalia,
and it can be initiated by

00:51:27.773 --> 00:51:29.610
either the male or by the
female,

00:51:29.610 --> 00:51:34.697
and when they finally do engage
in intercourse they do it often

00:51:34.697 --> 00:51:37.054
face to face,
missionary style,

00:51:37.054 --> 00:51:39.820
and it takes about as long as
it takes humans:

00:51:39.820 --> 00:51:43.139
an average of 11 minutes and up
to a half an hour,

00:51:43.139 --> 00:51:47.860
just in case you want to
compare.

00:51:47.860 --> 00:51:50.150
Now these big males are
ponderous,

00:51:50.150 --> 00:51:53.818
they can't move fast,
whereas, the females are lithe

00:51:53.818 --> 00:51:56.833
and they can go pretty fast,
so you know the female is

00:51:56.833 --> 00:51:59.166
choosing the male,
because if she didn't want him,

00:51:59.166 --> 00:52:02.579
she could be gone and there's
no way that he could catch her.

00:52:02.579 --> 00:52:06.059
What about the small males?
 

00:52:06.059 --> 00:52:09.878
They are not attractive to
females but they have one

00:52:09.878 --> 00:52:12.949
advantage, they're small and
they're fast,

00:52:12.949 --> 00:52:16.920
and they can run fast and they
can catch females.

00:52:16.920 --> 00:52:20.219
That's what mother evolution
has done.

00:52:20.219 --> 00:52:24.630
They try to catch and rape the
females.

00:52:24.630 --> 00:52:26.989
The females are usually,
as I said,

00:52:26.989 --> 00:52:31.539
alone with their young and if
they're found by a single--

00:52:31.539 --> 00:52:34.565
by one of these small males
they're chased and sometimes

00:52:34.565 --> 00:52:37.659
they get caught,
and then the females show fear

00:52:37.659 --> 00:52:41.539
and they struggle to escape,
and the males sometimes strike

00:52:41.539 --> 00:52:43.777
them or bite them,
and the females scream and the

00:52:43.777 --> 00:52:46.213
young--
they're dependent--the young

00:52:46.213 --> 00:52:48.679
scream,
the females bite back,

00:52:48.679 --> 00:52:53.585
they hit, they pull the hair of
the males while the copulation

00:52:53.585 --> 00:52:59.369
is going on and that lasts --
not more than ten minutes.

00:52:59.369 --> 00:53:01.710
How common is this?
 

00:53:01.710 --> 00:53:04.010
Different--orangutans are very
hard to see.

00:53:04.010 --> 00:53:07.376
They live in a part of Borneo
that's hard to get to and

00:53:07.376 --> 00:53:09.059
they're very hard to see.
 

00:53:09.059 --> 00:53:12.280
There are different studies
coming to different conclusions.

00:53:12.280 --> 00:53:16.322
One ethologist found that about
a third, 1/3 of orangutan

00:53:16.322 --> 00:53:20.800
copulations involve some degree
of forcing of the female by the

00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:21.449
male.
 

00:53:21.449 --> 00:53:25.050
Japanese observers reported
that 88% of the copulations were

00:53:25.050 --> 00:53:27.920
rapes and that these were of the
severe kind.

00:53:27.920 --> 00:53:31.813
A Dutch observer judged half
the copulations to be rape,

00:53:31.813 --> 00:53:34.010
so these are not rare events.
 

00:53:34.010 --> 00:53:39.739
They're a standard part of the
orangutan sexual strategy.

00:53:39.739 --> 00:53:44.197
There's a lot of examples where
orangutans are close enough to

00:53:44.197 --> 00:53:48.583
humans that apparently a lot of
those same sexual signals are

00:53:48.583 --> 00:53:49.460
passing.
 

00:53:49.460 --> 00:53:55.338
A woman primatologist who ran
primatology research in Borneo

00:53:55.338 --> 00:54:01.315
talked about an orangutan who
had lived with humans for a lot

00:54:01.315 --> 00:54:04.485
of his life,
so he was very acculturated to

00:54:04.485 --> 00:54:04.880
humans.
 

00:54:04.880 --> 00:54:08.025
One day apparently he raped one
of the female cooks,

00:54:08.025 --> 00:54:10.061
the orangutan,
the male orangutan,

00:54:10.061 --> 00:54:13.268
raped one of the human female
cooks at the camp.

00:54:13.268 --> 00:54:17.492
Apparently it was a complete
rape with penetration and

00:54:17.492 --> 00:54:18.530
everything.
 

00:54:18.530 --> 00:54:23.161
As you know,
rape is a big embarrassment for

00:54:23.161 --> 00:54:26.034
the female,
as well as the male,

00:54:26.034 --> 00:54:29.202
but in this case,
and this was in Indonesia,

00:54:29.202 --> 00:54:31.425
the husband,
very unusually,

00:54:31.425 --> 00:54:33.210
took it quite easily.
 

00:54:33.210 --> 00:54:36.275
The husband said that since the
rapist was not human,

00:54:36.275 --> 00:54:38.869
the rape should not provoke
shame or rage.

00:54:38.869 --> 00:54:42.389
He said, "Why should my
wife will or I be concerned;

00:54:42.389 --> 00:54:45.750
it wasn't a man."
 

00:54:45.750 --> 00:54:52.632
There are all kinds of stories
that I don't have time to tell

00:54:52.632 --> 00:54:54.010
you about.
 

00:54:54.010 --> 00:54:57.454
Okay, now why doesn't evolution
just keep the big males and the

00:54:57.454 --> 00:54:58.510
females together?
 

00:54:58.510 --> 00:55:02.110
Probably food density because
food is hard to get and

00:55:02.110 --> 00:55:05.920
individuals have to forage alone
to find enough food;

00:55:05.920 --> 00:55:09.512
if they foraged in pairs what
they found would not be enough

00:55:09.512 --> 00:55:10.610
for two of them.
 

00:55:10.610 --> 00:55:14.224
Now gorillas live in a region,
and have an ecology that they

00:55:14.224 --> 00:55:16.429
have more food available to
them,

00:55:16.429 --> 00:55:21.666
so they live in somewhat larger
groups and in gorillas the

00:55:21.666 --> 00:55:24.789
females stick close to the male.
 

00:55:24.789 --> 00:55:30.103
Each male, big silverback male
can have a harem of say three to

00:55:30.103 --> 00:55:31.389
four females.
 

00:55:31.389 --> 00:55:34.141
In these harems,
they spend most of their time

00:55:34.141 --> 00:55:36.099
just the few of them together.
 

00:55:36.099 --> 00:55:38.110
They're quiet;
they're relaxed;

00:55:38.110 --> 00:55:40.590
they're affectionate with each
other;

00:55:40.590 --> 00:55:44.360
the troop is stable with the
one silverback,

00:55:44.360 --> 00:55:49.360
the three or four females and
whatever young they have.

00:55:49.360 --> 00:55:53.121
Very little aggressiveness
of--between the males and the

00:55:53.121 --> 00:55:56.679
females, or female to female,
just hardly happens.

00:55:56.679 --> 00:56:00.030
But, as I said before,
if one male is controlling

00:56:00.030 --> 00:56:04.427
three to four females that means
there's two to three males that

00:56:04.427 --> 00:56:06.940
don't have any mates whatsoever.
 

00:56:06.940 --> 00:56:10.360
What is evolution going to do
with those bachelor males?

00:56:10.360 --> 00:56:12.809
Again, it isn't nice.
 

00:56:12.809 --> 00:56:15.889
The males--so the gorillas
travel through the jungle,

00:56:15.889 --> 00:56:17.369
resting some,
eating some,

00:56:17.369 --> 00:56:19.206
they eat fruits,
they eat roots,

00:56:19.206 --> 00:56:20.510
they eat shoots.
 

00:56:20.510 --> 00:56:24.885
These bachelor males follow the
troop on the uphill side and

00:56:24.885 --> 00:56:28.518
just wait until the silverback
is not watching.

00:56:28.518 --> 00:56:30.702
Then they charge down,
they can make a fair amount of

00:56:30.702 --> 00:56:32.932
noise,
so often the silverback notices

00:56:32.932 --> 00:56:36.641
and goes over and beats the hell
out of the guy and he retreats

00:56:36.641 --> 00:56:37.179
again.
 

00:56:37.179 --> 00:56:41.172
Every so often he's successful;
the male is with another female

00:56:41.172 --> 00:56:44.880
or off--never very far away,
but a little away.

00:56:44.880 --> 00:56:46.349
He goes down and what does he
do?

00:56:46.349 --> 00:56:48.849
He charges downhill,
so he gets up a lot of speed,

00:56:48.849 --> 00:56:52.210
he charges right at a female
with a young,

00:56:52.210 --> 00:56:57.101
he grabs the young immediately
smashes it on the ground and

00:56:57.101 --> 00:57:00.322
kills it;
runs away and doesn't try to do

00:57:00.322 --> 00:57:04.019
anything, but just kills the
young of the female.

00:57:04.019 --> 00:57:04.690
Now what does the female do?
 

00:57:04.690 --> 00:57:07.420
The female's are-- these are
very smart, they're great apes

00:57:07.420 --> 00:57:09.786
so they're very smart;
they recognize each other as

00:57:09.786 --> 00:57:11.896
individuals;
they have long memories,

00:57:11.896 --> 00:57:15.737
so you would expect that this
female would remember this male

00:57:15.737 --> 00:57:18.489
the rest of her life and fear
him, hate him,

00:57:18.489 --> 00:57:19.449
avoid him.
 

00:57:19.449 --> 00:57:21.659
In fact the opposite happens.
 

00:57:21.659 --> 00:57:25.268
What happens is the female
within a few days generally

00:57:25.268 --> 00:57:29.420
leaves the silverback that was
supposed to be guarding her and

00:57:29.420 --> 00:57:32.893
goes with the single male and
they go off and have a

00:57:32.893 --> 00:57:34.119
consortship.
 

00:57:34.119 --> 00:57:38.023
What the message that the male
is delivering to the female is,

00:57:38.023 --> 00:57:41.480
'Look you've put a huge
investment into this infant and

00:57:41.480 --> 00:57:42.760
now it's wasted.
 

00:57:42.760 --> 00:57:45.119
That guy can't protect you.
 

00:57:45.119 --> 00:57:47.101
He has too many females;
he's too old,

00:57:47.101 --> 00:57:50.090
he's too big and slow,
he can't protect you.

00:57:50.090 --> 00:57:52.918
I can--you can stay with him,
get pregnant again and I'm

00:57:52.918 --> 00:57:55.489
going to come down and kill your
next baby too,

00:57:55.489 --> 00:57:57.960
so if you want to reproduce you
come off with me.'

00:57:57.960 --> 00:58:00.485
Of course none of this is
verbal, this is an evolutionary

00:58:00.485 --> 00:58:02.110
story, I hope you understand
that.

00:58:02.110 --> 00:58:06.539
They're not mentating this
stuff that I'm saying.

00:58:06.539 --> 00:58:10.945
What you notice is in a few
days this female leaves and goes

00:58:10.945 --> 00:58:14.978
with the male that has just
killed her young and starts

00:58:14.978 --> 00:58:17.219
reproducing with that one.
 

00:58:17.219 --> 00:58:22.161
That may be stable and last a
long time, or another male may

00:58:22.161 --> 00:58:27.018
come by and in a few months
separate him--separate them.

00:58:27.018 --> 00:58:30.760
Again, these are not isolated
incidents.

00:58:30.760 --> 00:58:36.889
Diane Fossey had data on about
50 infants;

00:58:36.889 --> 00:58:41.733
38% of them died before they
were three, and 37% of those

00:58:41.733 --> 00:58:43.809
were from infanticide.
 

00:58:43.809 --> 00:58:47.438
About one infant in seven dies
from infanticide,

00:58:47.438 --> 00:58:51.996
and each of the female gorillas
she studied had at least one

00:58:51.996 --> 00:58:55.239
infant that was killed by
infanticide.

00:58:55.239 --> 00:58:57.974
In the gorillas,
the females are trapped in this

00:58:57.974 --> 00:59:00.070
vortex of male initiated
violence.

00:59:00.070 --> 00:59:03.681
At any moment a male may come
crashing through the forest and

00:59:03.681 --> 00:59:06.210
kill her young,
and the best way for her to

00:59:06.210 --> 00:59:08.920
prevent this is to go off with
that male.

00:59:08.920 --> 00:59:12.983
She needs protection,
she lives in a world of baby

00:59:12.983 --> 00:59:17.130
killers and she needs some
protection from them.

00:59:17.130 --> 00:59:19.980
Chimpanzees--so we're going
down the list of species,

00:59:19.980 --> 00:59:24.219
and we won't get time to
finish, but chimpanzees have yet

00:59:24.219 --> 00:59:28.838
another solution to this primate
reproductive problem of very,

00:59:28.838 --> 00:59:30.429
very scarce eggs.
 

00:59:30.429 --> 00:59:35.139
Unlike orangutans and gorillas,
the males are not solitary,

00:59:35.139 --> 00:59:39.282
but related males spend their
lifetime together as a

00:59:39.282 --> 00:59:40.420
community.
 

00:59:40.420 --> 00:59:44.750
Chimps live in groups of about
40 individuals,

00:59:44.750 --> 00:59:50.525
with a dozen or so adult males,
and a similar number of adult

00:59:50.525 --> 00:59:51.679
females.
 

00:59:51.679 --> 00:59:54.990
As with the orangutans,
the chimp females spend most of

00:59:54.990 --> 00:59:57.260
their time alone with their
young,

00:59:57.260 --> 01:00:01.246
and they're not separated from
their young until the young are

01:00:01.246 --> 01:00:03.989
several years old,
really into adolescence.

01:00:03.989 --> 01:00:06.231
First they hold them,
they're not physically

01:00:06.231 --> 01:00:09.144
separated for several years,
and then for several years

01:00:09.144 --> 01:00:11.847
they're not out of sight,
and then for several more years

01:00:11.847 --> 01:00:13.380
they're not out of voice
contact,

01:00:13.380 --> 01:00:16.782
so it's really very,
very tight bonding between

01:00:16.782 --> 01:00:18.409
mother and children.
 

01:00:18.409 --> 01:00:21.119
The males defend a rather large
territory,

01:00:21.119 --> 01:00:25.458
numbers of square kilometers,
in which they range and which

01:00:25.458 --> 01:00:28.677
the females range,
and the males spend their time

01:00:28.677 --> 01:00:31.670
searching for food,
patrolling the borders,

01:00:31.670 --> 01:00:34.893
the territory,
and they're often with other

01:00:34.893 --> 01:00:35.380
males.
 

01:00:35.380 --> 01:00:39.474
This patrolling is often--is a
bunch of males together and they

01:00:39.474 --> 01:00:43.108
go around checking on the
females to see which ones have

01:00:43.108 --> 01:00:46.610
come into estrus or if any have
come into estrus.

01:00:46.610 --> 01:00:49.355
As I mentioned,
the females come into estrus

01:00:49.355 --> 01:00:53.570
only about once every six years
after their last young was born.

01:00:53.570 --> 01:00:57.190
They have a 35-day cycle,
very similar to humans,

01:00:57.190 --> 01:01:01.717
and are sexually receptive for
about 15 of these days in each

01:01:01.717 --> 01:01:03.829
of their monthly cycles.
 

01:01:03.829 --> 01:01:08.498
Her fertility increases during
these 15 days and she's most

01:01:08.498 --> 01:01:13.489
fertile the last two or three
days of this receptive period.

01:01:13.489 --> 01:01:17.023
The females do an interesting
thing, have you ever been to a

01:01:17.023 --> 01:01:19.360
zoo and looked at chimpanzee
females?

01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:21.849
What do you see?
 

01:01:21.849 --> 01:01:23.809
Big red rump if they're fertile.
 

01:01:23.809 --> 01:01:26.250
It looks rather disgusting to
humans,

01:01:26.250 --> 01:01:27.518
and I've been looking for a
picture of it,

01:01:27.518 --> 01:01:29.050
and amazingly it's such a
striking thing,

01:01:29.050 --> 01:01:31.518
I cannot find a really good
picture of this.

01:01:31.518 --> 01:01:35.775
You go to a zoo it's very,
very obvious they--they're

01:01:35.775 --> 01:01:38.230
called ano-genital swelling.
 

01:01:38.230 --> 01:01:40.219
They advertise their estrus.
 

01:01:40.219 --> 01:01:42.940
Oppositely to humans;
humans keep their estrus secret;

01:01:42.940 --> 01:01:46.090
neither the male nor the female
knows whether they're in estrus.

01:01:46.090 --> 01:01:48.800
Chimpanzees advertise it,
everybody knows.

01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:50.809
Now why do they do that?
 

01:01:50.809 --> 01:01:53.320
Well what happens is when a
female comes into estrus,

01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:55.719
the males have been waiting all
year for this,

01:01:55.719 --> 01:01:58.632
the males congregate together
and what do the males start

01:01:58.632 --> 01:01:59.050
doing?
 

01:01:59.050 --> 01:02:00.699
Competing for the female.
 

01:02:00.699 --> 01:02:03.902
They're fighting,
the dominant male arrives,

01:02:03.902 --> 01:02:08.297
and it's clear whose dominant,
so the females advertise as a

01:02:08.297 --> 01:02:10.829
way of inciting male violence.
 

01:02:10.829 --> 01:02:13.018
That they want to be able to
choose the dominant male,

01:02:13.018 --> 01:02:15.760
the ones that are in great
fighting form,

01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:17.295
so they say,
'Hey I'm in estrus,

01:02:17.295 --> 01:02:21.815
all you guys come and fight,
and I'm going to sit there and

01:02:21.815 --> 01:02:27.487
choose the best of you,' which
in this case means the most

01:02:27.487 --> 01:02:29.280
violent of you.
 

01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:30.755
Unfortunately,
in this situation,

01:02:30.755 --> 01:02:33.340
all these males are not only
fighting with each other but

01:02:33.340 --> 01:02:35.280
they're trying to get at the
females,

01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:38.079
so the females are herded about.
 

01:02:38.079 --> 01:02:42.563
They have to run around to
escape the clashes with the

01:02:42.563 --> 01:02:43.239
males.
 

01:02:43.239 --> 01:02:47.480
They regularly receive quite a
lot of wounds when they're

01:02:47.480 --> 01:02:51.342
chased they try to climb up
trees to escape this and

01:02:51.342 --> 01:02:54.219
sometimes they fall out of
trees,

01:02:54.219 --> 01:02:57.030
and they have their young with
them,

01:02:57.030 --> 01:02:59.719
and the young sometimes cling
to them and then if they--

01:02:59.719 --> 01:03:01.400
the mothers fall, the kids fall.
 

01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:07.570
It's a very,
very dangerous unpleasant time.

01:03:07.570 --> 01:03:13.429
The violence is so great that
when a male approaches a female,

01:03:13.429 --> 01:03:17.239
she doesn't know whether he's
coming to be--

01:03:17.239 --> 01:03:20.532
to try to mate with her or to
be violent toward her because as

01:03:20.532 --> 01:03:23.878
you'll read in the reading how
the males have a long history of

01:03:23.878 --> 01:03:25.659
being violent to the females.
 

01:03:25.659 --> 01:03:29.295
It's a way of cowing them so
that when they're in this melee,

01:03:29.295 --> 01:03:32.385
when they're in estrus and the
male approaches them,

01:03:32.385 --> 01:03:33.719
they don't resist.
 

01:03:33.719 --> 01:03:38.960
If they do try to resist he
does a lot of violence on them.

01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:41.570
The male has to--when the male
comes and wants to mate with

01:03:41.570 --> 01:03:43.592
female,
he has to signal to her don't

01:03:43.592 --> 01:03:46.516
run away,
I'm not going to try to beat

01:03:46.516 --> 01:03:51.376
you up and he has--
this is--orangutans,

01:03:51.376 --> 01:03:57.130
gorilla, chimpanzee with her
young.

01:03:57.130 --> 01:04:01.929
This is the--this male is
inspecting the female,

01:04:01.929 --> 01:04:04.518
not only is there a red rump
but there's odors,

01:04:04.518 --> 01:04:09.490
chemicals, and he's trying to
see what the status of her cycle

01:04:09.490 --> 01:04:12.061
is,
and this is a male

01:04:12.061 --> 01:04:18.309
displaying--letting a female
know that this is a sexual

01:04:18.309 --> 01:04:19.929
engagement.
 

01:04:19.929 --> 01:04:22.630
Humans have been known to do
the same thing.

01:04:22.630 --> 01:04:26.579
This is a picture from ,
the same sort of advertising,

01:04:26.579 --> 01:04:30.081
with pretty much the same
message, and here's an

01:04:30.081 --> 01:04:32.018
incredible photograph.
 

01:04:32.018 --> 01:04:36.230
I don't know should I leave
that on the board for you?

01:04:36.230 --> 01:04:42.960
I get in trouble leaving things
like that on the--up for too

01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:43.760
long.
 

01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:46.920
Okay, now, so in this great
melee, this great violent melee,

01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:50.079
there's all the males there
trying to get at this female.

01:04:50.079 --> 01:04:53.974
If a male does--let's say that
alpha male is off fighting with

01:04:53.974 --> 01:04:57.360
someone else and the female is
alone for a minute,

01:04:57.360 --> 01:05:00.840
the male--any male that's
around rushes in.

01:05:00.840 --> 01:05:03.713
He's not going to have a lot of
time before the other males

01:05:03.713 --> 01:05:06.389
notice what's going on and rush
into separate them,

01:05:06.389 --> 01:05:12.280
because they're all competing
to inseminate that egg.

01:05:12.280 --> 01:05:16.083
The males have a very short
time in which to complete the

01:05:16.083 --> 01:05:19.887
copulation, and ejaculation
occurs after just 15 seconds,

01:05:19.887 --> 01:05:22.130
with only 8.8 pelvic thrusts.
 

01:05:22.130 --> 01:05:25.230
I think those are very
important numbers you should

01:05:25.230 --> 01:05:29.135
know, but the females make up in
quantity what they don't get in

01:05:29.135 --> 01:05:29.880
quality.
 

01:05:29.880 --> 01:05:32.177
They appear--and there's a
story behind this,

01:05:32.177 --> 01:05:34.840
but they appear to be quite
promiscuous in their sex

01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:35.518
partners.
 

01:05:35.518 --> 01:05:37.679
In the community followed by
Jane Goodall,

01:05:37.679 --> 01:05:40.641
in each estrus cycle,
each female had at least one

01:05:40.641 --> 01:05:43.000
bout of intercourse with every
male,

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:46.094
so all the males are getting
some chance at having

01:05:46.094 --> 01:05:46.980
intercourse.
 

01:05:46.980 --> 01:05:49.889
They average six encounters a
day.

01:05:49.889 --> 01:05:52.577
Don't get excited,
it's still only a minute and a

01:05:52.577 --> 01:05:55.469
half at their rate,
and in each monthly sexual

01:05:55.469 --> 01:05:58.980
cycle they have about 100 or so
bouts of intercourse,

01:05:58.980 --> 01:06:02.070
so there's a lot of sexuality.
 

01:06:02.070 --> 01:06:04.309
Do females have orgasms?
 

01:06:04.309 --> 01:06:07.519
Not known;
there are debates about it,

01:06:07.519 --> 01:06:08.460
but not known.
 

01:06:08.460 --> 01:06:12.840
All right, I guess our time is
running out.

01:06:12.840 --> 01:06:19.903
We will continue on Thursday
and I'll set up sections in

01:06:19.903 --> 01:06:23.630
between, and any questions?
 

01:06:23.630 --> 01:06:26.605
I stay after every lecture for
as long as necessary if people

01:06:26.605 --> 01:06:28.489
want to come down and ask
questions.

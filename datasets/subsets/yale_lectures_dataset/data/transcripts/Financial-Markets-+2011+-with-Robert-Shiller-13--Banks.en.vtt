PROFESSOR ROBERT SHILLER: OK.

00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:06.390
So, today we're going to talk
about banks, banking.

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.530
Before I start, I want just to
remind you that we have Hank

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:15.600
Greenberg coming on Wednesday
[addition: next lecture].

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.299
And we talked about him in a
previous lecture, but he is

00:00:19.299 --> 00:00:22.760
one of the most important
capitalists, I

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.426
think, in the world.

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:32.430
The firm, AIG, which was started
by C.V. Starr, was

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.250
converted into the biggest
insurance company in the world

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.050
by Hank Greenberg.

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.330
Over many years, the two of
them ran AIG exclusively,

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:45.270
first Starr and then
Greenberg.

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:55.510
And Greenberg produced a very
innovative insurance giant.

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.590
It didn't end well,
but I think he --

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:59.910
I talked to him the other day.

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.940
He said he's going to talk about
the end, what he learned

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.190
from the experience.

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:12.510
Once again, no one can control
everything that happens.

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:18.530
And random shocks affect
all of our lives.

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.170
He remains a very important --

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.220
he's no longer at AIG --

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.535
remains a very important
force in our society.

00:01:26.535 --> 00:01:32.730
Now, he's very much involved
with philanthropy and doing

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:37.780
things like lecturing young
people, what he freely does

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.470
out of a sense of commitment.

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.180
So, I think he's a committed
person that has a moral

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:48.160
purpose, that's why
I asked him to

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:49.410
be one of our lecturers.

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.300
But today we're talking
about banks.

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.370
And I wanted to --

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:01.520
The outline my lecture: I'm
going to start with the

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.695
origins of banks, thousands
of years ago.

00:02:05.695 --> 00:02:11.040
Then, I'll talk about the theory
of banks, fractional

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.970
reserves and deposit
insurance.

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.630
Then, bank regulation,
particularly in light of the

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.660
world financial crisis, which
has changed the nature of

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:22.360
regulation.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.250
Changes that will be with
us for decades to come.

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.030
I'll talk about shadow banking,
which is the new

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.150
banking sector that emerged and
escaped regulation until

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.490
the crisis.

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.540
And then, I'll talk at the
end a little bit about a

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:45.710
comparison of financial crises
in the past in various places

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:52.220
around the world, to see how
banks managed in those crises.

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.800
So, the first thing I want to
say is, this is a lecture

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:02.500
about banks, OK, and that means
traditional banks who

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.530
take deposits and lend money.

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.520
It's not about investment
banks.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:08.970
That's another lecture.

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.480
An investment bank, a pure
investment bank, does not

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.330
accept deposits.

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.610
And its most characteristic
thing is underwriting of

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:19.950
securities.

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.960
So, that's a different
lecture.

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:25.690
And I'm not talking about
central banks in this lecture.

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:26.890
That's also --

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:28.870
well, the lecture on
monetary policy.

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.420
Central banks are the government
organizations that

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.510
manage the money supply
of a country.

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:48.720
So, we're talking here about
banks, and I thought I should

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.185
start out by defining a bank.

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.630
The word bank, by the way,
means counter or tabletop

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:02.560
where bankers used to
do their business.

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:08.769
That's the English word that
emerged in the 15th century.

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:13.560
But banks, of course, precede
that with other names.

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:14.840
What is it that is the

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.665
characteristic activity of banks?

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:25.120
I would say, maybe the most
characteristic thing is that

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.140
banks earn spread income.

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:34.050
That is, they borrow at a lower
interest rate, and lend

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:36.370
it out at a higher interest
rate, and they make the

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:37.250
difference.

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:41.910
Your deposit rate is lower than
the rate at which they

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:43.555
charge for the loans
they make.

00:04:43.555 --> 00:04:48.440
So that's the spread
income or margin.

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:54.640
So, that might be considered the
core idea of a bank, that

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.760
you borrow at a lower
rate than you lend.

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:00.090
But I'm not sure that that
summarizes it, either.

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:05.060
There's other aspects of banks
that we'll talk about.

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:11.370
Another aspect of banks,
traditionally,

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:14.340
has been note issue.

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:21.810
That is, they print paper money,
and then it circulates

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.050
and goes --

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:26.910
you have some of these
in your pocket.

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:29.640
They're currency.

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.920
If you stopped a person on the
street a couple hundred years

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:36.620
ago, and said, what is the
essence of a bank?

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:39.800
I suspect, the first thing they
would say is, oh, they

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:41.430
print money.

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:43.510
And that's the paper
money that we use.

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:46.350
But you don't think
of it this way.

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:51.000
Probably not, because most of
that function all over the

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.670
world has been shifted to the
government banks, the central

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:59.300
banks, in the various
countries.

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:03.210
And so, you don't think
of private banks as

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:05.810
issuing bank notes.

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:09.310
But they used to and it
used to be prominent.

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:14.780
The private bank issuing of
notes today in the world, I

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:20.020
believe, is concentrated
primarily in two countries.

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:23.120
One of them is the United
Kingdom, and the

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.090
other one is Hong Kong.

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:27.420
Tell me if there's
another country.

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:29.420
I don't know who else does it.

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:32.810
In the United Kingdom there
are eight banks that still

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:35.090
print pound sterling notes.

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:39.960
And they're not very
prominent.

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:46.650
In Scotland, there are some.

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:49.440
I actually once went through
the Chunnel from England to

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.620
Scotland, oh, from Scotland to
France [correction: from

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:54.260
England to France], and I tried
to spend my Scottish

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.900
sterling notes on the train,
and the guy, who was

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:01.230
French-speaking, stared at
it and said, what's this?

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:02.460
And he wouldn't take it.

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:04.890
So I said, this is
pound sterling.

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:07.930
This is official.

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:13.250
It trades at par with the
Bank of England notes.

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:18.380
Hong Kong has three banks that
issue their bank notes.

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.030
Let's see, Hong Kong Shanghai
Bank [correction: Banking]

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:25.960
Corporation, the Standard
Chartered Bank, and the Bank

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:29.290
of China, Hong Kong.

00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:31.720
Everywhere else, banks
don't issue notes.

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:35.560
And the reason they don't is,
laws have been made to prevent

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:39.820
them, because these notes lost
value so many times in

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:42.790
financial crises that
governments said, it's not

00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:46.130
something that we'll allow
private banks to do.

00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:49.260
So, it's generally gone.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:53.350
If you look at your $1 bills in
your pocket, it will give

00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:55.880
the name of a Federal
Reserve bank.

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:57.580
And there's 12 of them.

00:07:57.580 --> 00:08:00.010
Our Federal Reserve bank
here is the Federal

00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:01.390
Reserve Bank of Boston.

00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:04.340
So, you can look at your dollar
bills and see which

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:06.220
bank issued it.

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:10.130
So, you're probably carrying a
lot of Boston money, but since

00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:12.540
it's all the government, you
know, you don't even notice

00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:12.990
that, right?

00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:14.680
You don't notice.

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:18.210
If this were 1750, and you had
Boston money in your pocket,

00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:19.850
you might -- because we're
in Connecticut --

00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:20.929
you might have a problem.

00:08:20.929 --> 00:08:23.390
You'd have to go to a money
dealer and have it exchanged,

00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:26.840
because they didn't know or
trust the Boston bank.

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:32.450
That's all past. So, note issue
is a matter of history.

00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:38.560
So, there's other aspects of
a bank I want to emphasize.

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:41.060
One is liquidity.

00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:48.770
And this is an essential element
of banking as well,

00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:50.740
and I'll come back to
that when we talk

00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:52.590
about theory in a minute.

00:08:52.590 --> 00:08:58.410
But banks offer liquidity
by borrowing

00:08:58.410 --> 00:09:01.330
short and lending long.

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:03.690
This is different from
spread income.

00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:06.660
I'm saying, the interest rate
is lower on the borrowing of

00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:09.640
the bank than the lending
of the bank.

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:11.020
There's another discrepancy.

00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:15.500
The maturity is longer on the
lending of the bank than the

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:17.120
borrowing of the bank.

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:19.020
So, banks are providers
of liquidity.

00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:22.530
That means, a business wants to
borrow money, or let's say

00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:25.850
a homeowner wants to borrow
money to buy a home.

00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:27.030
Let's take that example.

00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:28.430
That's more familiar.

00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:30.920
You're going to lock up the
money for maybe 30 years.

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:33.710
You don't want to pay the
loan back tomorrow.

00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:36.810
What if the lender says, I need
the money, give it back.

00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:39.470
You can't give it back, or you
don't want to give it back.

00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:44.420
So, what a bank does is, it
takes deposits and allows

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:49.620
people to cash them in
whenever they want.

00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:54.720
It lends the money out long
on 30-year, or so, loans.

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:56.240
So, it generates liquidity.

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:58.750
The borrower has what he
or she wants, which

00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:01.300
is a 30-year loan.

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:03.710
The lender has what they want.

00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:12.620
They have an account they
can get at any time.

00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:15.940
And so this is an important
function of banks.

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:19.510
But the problem with
it is, that there's

00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:20.760
a problem of crises.

00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:26.700
Because if everybody asks to
pull their money out at once,

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:28.890
they can't do it.

00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:32.390
The banks, in normal
circumstances, generate

00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:36.280
liquidity, but they create a
system that's vulnerable.

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:42.910
And so, the banking industry has
been plagued by frequent

00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:45.920
crises throughout history.

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:49.210
So, I wanted to say something
about the very

00:10:49.210 --> 00:10:50.690
beginnings of banking.

00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:51.940
Who did it first? --

00:10:54.850 --> 00:10:55.820
By the way, I should
have written the

00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:57.586
words interest rate.

00:10:57.586 --> 00:11:00.610
When I'm talking about spread
income or margin, I'm talking

00:11:00.610 --> 00:11:03.450
about the difference between
two interest rates.

00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:09.740
But more primitive is the
idea of interest rate.

00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:12.790
So, where did that
idea come from?

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:18.130
Well, I was reading some
economic historians.

00:11:18.130 --> 00:11:21.920
Apparently, the word interest
first appeared in

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:23.345
the Sumerian language.

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:31.490
I guess, the oldest records
are about 2000 BC.

00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:36.140
And they had a word which
they write as mas.

00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:39.440
I guess, that's pronounced mosh,
which was their word for

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:41.960
interest, but it also
means lamb.

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:45.070
And so, one historian was
wondering, why do the

00:11:45.070 --> 00:11:50.370
Sumerians use the same word for
interest as they do for an

00:11:50.370 --> 00:11:51.600
animal, a lamb.

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:56.860
And he thought that maybe it
was because the idea of

00:11:56.860 --> 00:12:01.390
lending money at interest grew
out of an earlier idea of

00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:02.910
renting land.

00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:06.360
So, you would have land that you
weren't using in ancient

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:10.650
Sumeria, and you would rent
it out to somebody who

00:12:10.650 --> 00:12:12.140
would then use it.

00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:14.230
And one of the things that the
person would do with it, is

00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:17.980
raise livestock, raise
sheep, on the land.

00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:20.760
So, you would say, well, I need
some produce from the

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:24.480
land to compensate me for
letting you use it.

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:26.270
So the guy would say, fine,
I'll give you all the

00:12:26.270 --> 00:12:29.080
offspring of our sheep,
the lambs.

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:31.490
That was an old tradition
in Sumeria.

00:12:31.490 --> 00:12:33.960
So, they thought it's basically
the same thing.

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:35.710
It's like giving
over the lambs.

00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:37.900
If I lend you money, I'm
giving you productive

00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:40.020
resources, and it's going
to produce something.

00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:41.550
We'll call it lambs.

00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:42.495
And I want that.

00:12:42.495 --> 00:12:44.630
And you're compensating
me for it.

00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:46.680
So, that's where
the idea began.

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:55.990
And so, you'll find it in the
ancient world, in the near,

00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:58.630
non-oriental ancient world.

00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:01.960
In ancient Greece and Rome,
interest was well-established.

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:03.710
And some kind of banking.

00:13:03.710 --> 00:13:07.230
Now, I don't know whether there
were bankers in Sumeria,

00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:10.410
but there probably were, because
all it takes is that

00:13:10.410 --> 00:13:11.660
you do both sides.

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:15.560
They actually didn't necessarily
lend money in

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:16.380
those days.

00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:20.260
They would lend barley or wheat,
and they would charge

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:23.100
interest in terms of wheat.

00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:24.950
You don't need money
to do banking.

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:32.570
But I suspect that somebody
in ancient Sumeria

00:13:32.570 --> 00:13:33.700
was doing both sides.

00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:36.970
He was borrowing wheat, and
lending it, and earning a

00:13:36.970 --> 00:13:37.735
spread income.

00:13:37.735 --> 00:13:44.410
And so, there must have been
banking in the ancient world.

00:13:44.410 --> 00:13:47.680
But anyway, what about these
kinds of institutions that we

00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:48.350
call banks?

00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:51.900
Oh also, the first --
apparently, if I've got my

00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:57.140
history right, the first record
of interest rates in

00:13:57.140 --> 00:13:58.740
China was Song Dynasty.

00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:07.930
And that was from the
year 960 to 1279.

00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:10.810
They were, at that point,
inventing paper money and

00:14:10.810 --> 00:14:14.240
other financial institutions.

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:16.410
I don't know if they had
institutions called banks.

00:14:16.410 --> 00:14:19.630
But, you know, it often
would be a family

00:14:19.630 --> 00:14:22.910
business lending money.

00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:26.510
If you were a prominent family,
you would often take

00:14:26.510 --> 00:14:31.210
other people's money
for safekeeping.

00:14:31.210 --> 00:14:37.370
And it was also connected with
religious temples in the past.

00:14:37.370 --> 00:14:43.860
But the modern banks seem to
appear in Italy in Renaissance

00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:49.780
times, where they actually had
a banking institution.

00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:51.850
And that's where the
oldest bank in

00:14:51.850 --> 00:14:55.360
the world today exists.

00:14:55.360 --> 00:15:11.720
It's Banca Monte dei
Paschi, in Siena.

00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:16.030
And that means the bank of
the mountain of sheep.

00:15:16.030 --> 00:15:19.070
It's the same analogy,
I guess.

00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:21.720
I don't know if they called
their interest lambs.

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:28.520
And so, that bank was
set up in 1472.

00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:31.120
That's the oldest surviving
bank in the world.

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:31.660
I went there.

00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:33.840
You can go there if you visit
Siena, and they have a little

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:37.570
museum on the first floor
near the lobby.

00:15:37.570 --> 00:15:41.290
And it's actually the third
largest bank in Italy.

00:15:41.290 --> 00:15:44.450
A very old institution.

00:15:44.450 --> 00:15:48.160
It's interesting that this bank,
which was founded in

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:53.580
1472, was founded as a
philanthropic institution to

00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:55.760
lend money to the poor.

00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:59.030
And wealthy donors in
Italy gave money

00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:00.360
to set up this bank.

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:01.560
It goes beyond that now.

00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:04.272
It's not just lending
to the poor.

00:16:04.272 --> 00:16:09.870
The other thing is in
the 1600's, they

00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:11.560
gave it deposit insurance.

00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:13.840
Believe it or not.

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:19.680
The Duke of Siena said he would
guarantee all deposits.

00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:22.420
So, deposit insurance
appears to have been

00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:23.980
invented in Italy as well.

00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:29.240
But a lot of people emphasize,
when they talk about the

00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:32.570
history of banking --

00:16:32.570 --> 00:16:39.015
I was reading, in preparing for
this, economic histories

00:16:39.015 --> 00:16:41.610
to see what they would
say about banking.

00:16:41.610 --> 00:16:46.950
And professor Clive Day, a
professor here at Yale, wrote

00:16:46.950 --> 00:16:54.740
a book called, History
of Commerce, in 1907.

00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:57.380
You can pick up his book, if you
want to, on Google Books.

00:16:57.380 --> 00:16:59.560
It's past its copyright.

00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:02.040
I had great fun reading it.

00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:05.859
He's long gone, a professor
at Yale.

00:17:05.859 --> 00:17:08.990
But his history begins in
England, with the so-called

00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:10.240
goldsmith bankers.

00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:21.390
What happened was, in England in
the maybe 1500's or 1600's,

00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:24.060
somewhere around that,
goldsmiths who made gold

00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:28.460
jewelry had safes or good
places to store gold.

00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:31.930
And so, people would go to the
goldsmith, and maybe they're

00:17:31.930 --> 00:17:34.730
having jewelry made, but then
they'd say, could you keep

00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:37.360
some of my gold in your vault?

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:39.125
And so, the goldsmith banker
would say, all

00:17:39.125 --> 00:17:40.600
right, I'll do that.

00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:44.390
And I'll give you a note saying,
I'll promise to pay

00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:47.580
you this amount of gold
that's in my vault.

00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:49.980
So, sometime when you were out
shopping, the goldsmith

00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:53.705
banker's note would be in your
pocket still, and you'd want

00:17:53.705 --> 00:17:55.130
to buy something.

00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:56.650
So you'd say, well,
I've got this --

00:17:56.650 --> 00:17:58.920
you talk to the merchant and you
say, I've got this gold.

00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:00.160
It's in the goldsmith.

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:01.840
I've got his note here.

00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:05.690
So the merchant would say, all
right, I'll take that, but

00:18:05.690 --> 00:18:07.130
you've got to endorse
it over to me.

00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:11.840
Write a note on the note saying
that this thing is

00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:13.850
being transferred to me.

00:18:13.850 --> 00:18:16.180
And so, I can go to the
goldsmith and get it out.

00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:19.680
That's how paper money got
started in England.

00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:22.710
It started to circulate with
many endorsements on it.

00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:25.140
And then finally, the goldsmith
said, let's forget

00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:27.240
about endorsing it
to one person.

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:29.460
Let's just say, to the bearer.

00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:31.720
And so, paper money started
developing kind of

00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:33.130
spontaneously.

00:18:33.130 --> 00:18:35.710
And then, the goldsmiths
noticed, you know, they've got

00:18:35.710 --> 00:18:38.640
all this gold in their vault,
they can lend it out.

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:39.220
Why not?

00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:41.450
Because nobody ever comes and
asks for it, now that these

00:18:41.450 --> 00:18:44.570
paper notes are circulating.

00:18:44.570 --> 00:18:47.950
Nobody asks for it, so I'll
start lending it out.

00:18:47.950 --> 00:18:50.230
And they didn't have to pay
any interest on the notes,

00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:53.330
because people would hold them
anyway just because they

00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:54.530
valued the safekeeping.

00:18:54.530 --> 00:18:56.360
I guess they were paying
interest in the sense that

00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:58.760
they were providing
the safekeeping.

00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:02.520
So, that's how banking got
started in England, but it was

00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:04.400
really preceded in Italy.

00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:23.960
What has happened is, because
of repeated problems in the

00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:26.490
banking industry, which
gradually grew through time

00:19:26.490 --> 00:19:29.520
into something that's more and
more important, governments

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:32.110
all over the world
regulate them.

00:19:32.110 --> 00:19:35.540
And that means they define
certain specific types of

00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:42.890
banks that differ a little bit
from one country to another.

00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:43.950
And you have to --

00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:46.780
when you decide to
create a bank --

00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:51.240
you have to decide which
type you are.

00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:52.490
So, I wanted to start --

00:19:52.490 --> 00:19:55.750
And in your textbook, Fabozzi
et al., talks a lot about

00:19:55.750 --> 00:19:58.240
types of banks.

00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:04.150
But let me just talk about
the major types.

00:20:04.150 --> 00:20:09.080
I'll talk in the U.S. The most
important type of bank is

00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:11.530
called a commercial bank.

00:20:14.490 --> 00:20:17.550
And these are banks that
take deposits.

00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:19.986
You can put your money in the
bank, and then it will pay you

00:20:19.986 --> 00:20:25.790
interest, and it will also make
loans of various kinds.

00:20:25.790 --> 00:20:30.970
But, most characteristically,
business loans.

00:20:30.970 --> 00:20:35.550
Commercial banks were even
more prominent 100 or 200

00:20:35.550 --> 00:20:37.530
years ago, because they
didn't do mortgages

00:20:37.530 --> 00:20:38.780
and consumer loans.

00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:41.500
It was all business
loans, initially.

00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:42.950
So, this is kind
of the historic

00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:45.860
important kind of bank.

00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:57.280
And in 2010, the total assets
of U.S.-located, commercial

00:20:57.280 --> 00:21:00.690
banks were $14.6 trillion.

00:21:00.690 --> 00:21:05.170
But actually, a lot of that was
foreign commercial banks

00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:07.190
operating in the
United States.

00:21:07.190 --> 00:21:17.030
Of that $14.6 trillion, only
10.1 was U.S.-chartered banks.

00:21:17.030 --> 00:21:19.520
So, bankers operate all
over the world.

00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:22.120
So, we have banks like, I
mentioned Hong Kong and

00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:22.970
Shanghai Bank
[correction: Banking]

00:21:22.970 --> 00:21:26.250
Corporation, or the various
Swiss banks that have big

00:21:26.250 --> 00:21:28.695
operations, or Deutsche
Bank, big operations

00:21:28.695 --> 00:21:29.810
in the United States.

00:21:29.810 --> 00:21:36.620
So, they account for almost a
third of our commercial banks.

00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:38.410
But then, there are other kinds
of banks, and they're

00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:43.830
smaller in terms of -- this
is assets of the banks.

00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:45.415
It's not their market cap.

00:21:45.415 --> 00:21:48.340
The market cap would be much
lower, because remember

00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:51.590
offsetting these assets are
liabilities they owe to the

00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:52.840
depositors.

00:21:56.050 --> 00:21:57.960
But there's other
kinds of banks.

00:21:57.960 --> 00:22:00.140
There are savings banks.

00:22:05.530 --> 00:22:13.735
In the U.S., savings banks
had only $1.2 trillion.

00:22:19.530 --> 00:22:27.260
These savings banks tend to be
old institutions that have

00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:29.290
grown very large over time.

00:22:29.290 --> 00:22:31.720
They're the result of a savings
bank movement in the

00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:34.970
19th century, which was a
philanthropic movement to set

00:22:34.970 --> 00:22:39.050
up banks for lower-income
people.

00:22:39.050 --> 00:22:41.350
Because commercial banks
traditionally wouldn't take

00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:43.220
deposits from small --

00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:44.830
you'd have to have
a minimum size.

00:22:44.830 --> 00:22:48.950
They didn't deal with
ordinary people.

00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:50.670
So, they created savings
banks to

00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:54.870
encourage thrift and saving.

00:22:54.870 --> 00:22:57.610
Actually, it follows on a U.K.
movement, a savings bank

00:22:57.610 --> 00:22:59.830
movement in the U.K. And they're
still with us, but

00:22:59.830 --> 00:23:02.145
they're not so big.

00:23:02.145 --> 00:23:05.940
And there's also
credit unions.

00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:08.470
That's another social
movement.

00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:15.250
And they're only $0.9 trillion,
or about $900

00:23:15.250 --> 00:23:17.190
billion in assets.

00:23:17.190 --> 00:23:21.300
Credit unions are basically
clubs of people that belong

00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:24.210
together in some group.

00:23:24.210 --> 00:23:26.680
If you have a company, you can
set up a credit union for the

00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:27.930
employees of your company.

00:23:32.810 --> 00:23:34.800
Both savings banks and
credit unions make a

00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:36.150
lot of mortgage loans.

00:23:36.150 --> 00:23:42.100
That's kind of their
characteristic business.

00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:46.250
In the U.K., you have the
same kinds of banks.

00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:51.450
Savings banks would be called
building societies, but it's

00:23:51.450 --> 00:23:52.630
the same idea.

00:23:52.630 --> 00:23:54.460
They make loans for building.

00:24:00.490 --> 00:24:07.300
So, I said I would talk about
the theory of banks.

00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:10.410
I've already given you some
indication by describing what

00:24:10.410 --> 00:24:12.690
is it that banks do.

00:24:12.690 --> 00:24:17.590
But I see I have a lot
more to talk about.

00:24:17.590 --> 00:24:21.310
I have to consider
my time here.

00:24:21.310 --> 00:24:22.730
There's so much to
say about banks.

00:24:22.730 --> 00:24:25.500
It's a whole fascinating
subject.

00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:32.763
But I wanted to mention, the
theory of banks was laid out

00:24:32.763 --> 00:24:41.967
in the Diamond-Dybvig model in
the Journal of Political

00:24:41.967 --> 00:24:44.810
Economy, 1988.

00:24:44.810 --> 00:24:46.920
They were both colleagues
of ours at Yale.

00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:48.630
They've moved on.

00:24:48.630 --> 00:24:49.970
So, I know them both.

00:24:49.970 --> 00:24:52.390
Doug Diamond and Phil Dybvig.

00:24:52.390 --> 00:24:54.840
But what they described
is a model --

00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:56.490
I'm not going to give you the
model, just to tell you about

00:24:56.490 --> 00:24:59.280
it -- the theoretical
model of banks as

00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:03.050
providers of liquidity.

00:25:03.050 --> 00:25:06.690
That liquidity is an economic
good that you can somehow get

00:25:06.690 --> 00:25:08.590
for nothing.

00:25:08.590 --> 00:25:11.850
It's just like portfolio
diversification.

00:25:11.850 --> 00:25:14.800
We don't need to expend
any resources to get

00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:16.985
diversification, we just
have to manage

00:25:16.985 --> 00:25:18.710
our portfolios right.

00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:20.570
Similarly, you set up
a bank, and lo and

00:25:20.570 --> 00:25:22.900
behold, liquidity appears.

00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:24.550
And it makes it possible
for people to

00:25:24.550 --> 00:25:26.140
live their lives better.

00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:29.080
I mentioned that you can live
in a house for 30 years, or

00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:30.520
you can move whenever
you want.

00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:35.890
But the problem with this is
that there are multiple

00:25:35.890 --> 00:25:37.850
equilibria.

00:25:37.850 --> 00:25:42.390
Their model has a good
equilibrium and a bad

00:25:42.390 --> 00:25:45.290
equilibrium, and it depends
on expectations.

00:25:45.290 --> 00:25:49.390
If people think that the banking
system is sound and

00:25:49.390 --> 00:25:52.220
it's going to work well,
it works splendidly.

00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:55.590
But the problem is, all it
takes is for people to

00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:58.670
suddenly change their
expectations, and then it all

00:25:58.670 --> 00:26:00.890
falls apart because
you have a run.

00:26:00.890 --> 00:26:02.140
You have a bank run.

00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:09.210
So, what Diamond and Dybvig did
is to provide an economic

00:26:09.210 --> 00:26:13.460
rationale for deposit
insurance.

00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:20.330
Insuring deposits against
default of the bank helps

00:26:20.330 --> 00:26:25.240
prevent bad outcomes, keeps us
in the right equilibrium.

00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:31.062
So, this is an important
paper.

00:26:31.062 --> 00:26:37.850
The problem is that banks runs
can be triggered by random

00:26:37.850 --> 00:26:40.140
shocks to the model.

00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:44.510
And so, what happened in the
latest crisis is, there was a

00:26:44.510 --> 00:26:46.310
real estate bubble.

00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:47.700
It's not something that's
represented

00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:51.110
in Diamond and Dybvig.

00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:55.180
And the bubble, when it burst,
when home prices started

00:26:55.180 --> 00:26:58.880
falling, and commercial real
estate prices started falling,

00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:04.180
the banking system started
to fall apart.

00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:11.525
So, it's not entirely easy to
keep banks under good control.

00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:21.110
You see, Diamond and Dybvig
emphasized that banks are an

00:27:21.110 --> 00:27:24.340
invention that creates
liquidity.

00:27:24.340 --> 00:27:28.330
And liquidity is a positive
economic good that makes us

00:27:28.330 --> 00:27:29.430
run our lives better.

00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:31.720
So, it's an important
invention in

00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:34.550
the history of economics.

00:27:34.550 --> 00:27:38.290
But there's other issues that
banks do, problems they solve.

00:27:38.290 --> 00:27:46.920
One of them is an adverse
selection problem that plagues

00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:48.170
securities.

00:27:51.250 --> 00:27:54.690
I didn't mention that the
alternative to banks for

00:27:54.690 --> 00:27:58.710
raising money, if you're a
business, is, that you could

00:27:58.710 --> 00:28:01.370
issue bonds or commercial
paper.

00:28:01.370 --> 00:28:05.310
You can borrow money directly
from the public without an

00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:08.020
intermediary.

00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:09.560
They do this.

00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:10.730
I'm a company.

00:28:10.730 --> 00:28:13.600
I need money to, say,
build a new factory.

00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:15.480
I go not to a commercial bank.

00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:18.650
I go to an investment bank, and
they help me issue some

00:28:18.650 --> 00:28:21.520
paper to the public.

00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:24.180
And we sell it off
in some market.

00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:30.370
The problem with issuing debt
directly to the public is,

00:28:30.370 --> 00:28:35.880
that the public can't
judge the quality

00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:38.410
of the company easily.

00:28:38.410 --> 00:28:42.780
Most people who are investors
are not good at estimating the

00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:45.720
value or the security
of a company.

00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:48.510
So, they need some
kind of experts.

00:28:48.510 --> 00:28:51.870
If the adverse selection would
happen, see, the experts, the

00:28:51.870 --> 00:28:55.400
people who know, would buy all
the good stuff, and it would

00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:57.500
leave beyond --

00:28:57.500 --> 00:28:59.600
people would start to think,
I'm not going to buy these

00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:03.190
securities, because why are
they being offered to me?

00:29:03.190 --> 00:29:04.100
I don't know anything.

00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:05.530
I'm a sucker.

00:29:05.530 --> 00:29:06.700
That's the idea.

00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:08.980
I'm not a sucker, I
just don't know.

00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:11.550
I may be smart, but I just don't
know what the quality of

00:29:11.550 --> 00:29:13.480
this company is.

00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:16.590
If I just go in there blindly
and pick up whatever seems to

00:29:16.590 --> 00:29:19.680
be out there, I'm going to
suffer an adverse selection.

00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:21.240
I'm going to get the worst
stuff, because

00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:22.060
I'm not looking --

00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:25.750
I can't look, they're going to
dump the bad paper on me.

00:29:25.750 --> 00:29:31.930
So, banks solve that by being in
the community, knowing who

00:29:31.930 --> 00:29:38.080
is borrowing, and having a
reputation, so that instead of

00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:41.160
you suffering this adverse
selection problem, the bank

00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:43.890
has people who know
what's going on.

00:29:43.890 --> 00:29:47.030
So, the thing about banks is,
that they have local loan

00:29:47.030 --> 00:29:50.870
officers who serve in a
particular community.

00:29:50.870 --> 00:29:54.270
And they know all about
that community.

00:29:54.270 --> 00:29:56.270
And they solve the adverse
selection problem.

00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:04.290
So, for example, if you are a
loan officer in a bank, by

00:30:04.290 --> 00:30:08.600
tradition, you are
someone who gets

00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:10.000
involved in the community.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:13.440
You'll find them on the program
at the symphony.

00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:15.100
They're one of the donors.

00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:16.760
They show up for all
kinds of things.

00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:18.010
They know what's going on.

00:30:18.010 --> 00:30:20.720
They play golf with local
business people.

00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:22.160
They hear the gossip.

00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:24.470
So, someone says, you know,
this guy, the CEO of this

00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:27.140
company, I think he's
an alcoholic.

00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:29.740
You better watch this guy, I
don't know what he's doing.

00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:30.590
You hear these things.

00:30:30.590 --> 00:30:31.530
And you know what happens?

00:30:31.530 --> 00:30:34.030
The guy doesn't get a
loan the next day.

00:30:34.030 --> 00:30:38.820
I hate to say it, but they
kind of vouch for the

00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:40.630
character of people.

00:30:40.630 --> 00:30:43.130
I mentioned this in a previous
lecture, that there's all

00:30:43.130 --> 00:30:44.720
kinds of people out there.

00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:47.490
And you can't prove or
judge who's good.

00:30:47.490 --> 00:30:50.340
You can't write it down in
some objective way, who's

00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:53.280
going to be a responsible
business person.

00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:55.920
But banks know that,
so they solve the

00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:59.060
adverse selection problem.

00:30:59.060 --> 00:31:04.365
There's also a moral hazard
problem that banks solve.

00:31:08.090 --> 00:31:13.550
The moral hazard is that a
company may borrow money, and

00:31:13.550 --> 00:31:17.520
then take a big flyer and
do some wild investment.

00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:20.390
Let's take this, for example:
Suppose we owned a small

00:31:20.390 --> 00:31:22.810
company and it's
not doing well.

00:31:22.810 --> 00:31:24.620
We have this great idea.

00:31:24.620 --> 00:31:30.000
Let's borrow $10 million, and
let's go to the racetrack and

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:35.390
let's put it all on
the least likely

00:31:35.390 --> 00:31:36.620
horse to win, all right.

00:31:36.620 --> 00:31:41.600
And, you know, our chance of
winning is only one of 10, but

00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:45.700
if we win, I got $100 million.

00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:47.940
If we lose then, hey,
we just go bankrupt.

00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:49.940
We say, sorry.

00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:51.810
Of course, you really couldn't
do it at the racetrack.

00:31:51.810 --> 00:31:53.980
I mean, you'd be sued
if you did that.

00:31:53.980 --> 00:31:55.780
But you see what I'm saying.

00:31:55.780 --> 00:31:57.090
I could see --

00:31:57.090 --> 00:31:58.470
I wouldn't do that --
but I could see

00:31:58.470 --> 00:31:59.635
wanting to do that, right?

00:31:59.635 --> 00:32:02.070
Your company's going out of
business anyway, you know, you

00:32:02.070 --> 00:32:03.720
don't have any prospects.

00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:07.580
But if we can borrow $10
million, go and bet it on the

00:32:07.580 --> 00:32:10.060
racetrack, and one in ten
we'll be super rich.

00:32:10.060 --> 00:32:11.750
We'll have $90 million, right?

00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:12.560
Pay off the debtors.

00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:13.740
Everything's fine.

00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:15.800
They won't complain
if you win.

00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:18.810
They'll complain if you lose,
but then you say, sorry, you

00:32:18.810 --> 00:32:20.140
know, we're out of business.

00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:22.160
It's limited liability.

00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:25.540
So, what banks do is, they help
solve this problem by

00:32:25.540 --> 00:32:29.820
constant monitoring, and they
make commercial loans that are

00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:34.230
at effectively long-term, but
in practice, officially

00:32:34.230 --> 00:32:34.750
short-term.

00:32:34.750 --> 00:32:38.040
They keep renewing them, and
they can cut you off, when

00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:40.270
they think you're doing
something that

00:32:40.270 --> 00:32:42.220
reflects moral hazard.

00:32:42.220 --> 00:32:47.570
So, the constant monitoring that
banks provide solves the

00:32:47.570 --> 00:32:51.640
moral hazard problem, just as
their information collection

00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:53.476
solves the adverse selection
problem.

00:33:03.330 --> 00:33:05.840
I'm just trying to see, where
I want to go next.

00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:13.900
So, I mentioned deposit
insurance.

00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:19.980
I mentioned that it started in
Italy in the 1600's, but it

00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:25.610
has a long history of
governments backing up

00:33:25.610 --> 00:33:28.790
deposits of banks in order
to prevent banks runs.

00:33:28.790 --> 00:33:30.790
Because bank runs happened
too often.

00:33:30.790 --> 00:33:32.870
People would get a little
scared, and they would go to

00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:34.590
the back and try to pull
all their money out.

00:33:34.590 --> 00:33:37.390
They'd hear a rumor, and
then the whole banking

00:33:37.390 --> 00:33:38.480
system could collapse.

00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:42.480
And so, people in various
governments at various times

00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:44.170
offered guarantees.

00:33:44.170 --> 00:33:46.410
But the problem is,
those guarantees

00:33:46.410 --> 00:33:48.240
can get really expensive.

00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:51.100
So sometimes, they had a limited
guarantee, and so

00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:55.810
sometimes, the deposit insurance
scheme would fail.

00:33:55.810 --> 00:34:02.060
And so, the history of deposit
insurance is a checkered one.

00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:04.480
So, in United States there
were various state

00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:06.380
governments, local governments,
that created

00:34:06.380 --> 00:34:10.580
deposit insurance schemes before
the FDIC, but a lot of

00:34:10.580 --> 00:34:14.150
them failed, and so, people
said this is a crazy idea.

00:34:14.150 --> 00:34:19.239
But the United States
government in 19 --

00:34:19.239 --> 00:34:23.159
I think it was '33, do
I have this right? --

00:34:23.159 --> 00:34:24.810
created --

00:34:24.810 --> 00:34:26.710
I think that's right --

00:34:26.710 --> 00:34:30.389
the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation as part of the New

00:34:30.389 --> 00:34:34.550
Deal under Franklin
Delano Roosevelt.

00:34:34.550 --> 00:34:39.030
And it has never failed
to this date.

00:34:39.030 --> 00:34:40.989
Why didn't it fail?

00:34:40.989 --> 00:34:42.020
It's hard to know, exactly.

00:34:42.020 --> 00:34:46.000
We never had a big back
run since 1933.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:49.590
It seemed to create the
psychology that people stopped

00:34:49.590 --> 00:34:53.070
worrying about bank failures,
because they believed they

00:34:53.070 --> 00:34:53.770
were insured.

00:34:53.770 --> 00:34:58.490
I guess they believed Franklin
Delano Roosevelt.

00:34:58.490 --> 00:35:04.610
And so, if you believe it, then
it's one of those funny

00:35:04.610 --> 00:35:06.520
things, it's the multiple
equilibria that

00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:08.240
Diamond-Dybvig mentioned.

00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:10.340
As long as people believe
the bank system is

00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:11.590
sound, it is sound.

00:35:15.660 --> 00:35:18.970
We also created later, another
deposit insurance, called the

00:35:18.970 --> 00:35:21.552
Federal Savings and Loan
Insurance Corporation

00:35:21.552 --> 00:35:22.740
[addition: abbreviated FSLIC],

00:35:22.740 --> 00:35:26.940
that was doing the savings and
loan associations, which were

00:35:26.940 --> 00:35:29.590
a type of savings bank.

00:35:29.590 --> 00:35:34.140
And that did fail.

00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:37.960
And so, we had a huge crisis in
the United States, called

00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:43.900
the savings and loan crisis,
in the 1980's.

00:35:43.900 --> 00:35:58.080
So, the S&amp;L crisis in the 1980's
was due to a widespread

00:35:58.080 --> 00:36:01.130
failure of savings and loan
associations, and then, kind

00:36:01.130 --> 00:36:04.880
of a run on the savings and
loans, but it wasn't really a

00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:08.310
run, because the FSLIC
was trusted.

00:36:08.310 --> 00:36:14.060
And what ended up happening
is, the FSLIC had reserves

00:36:14.060 --> 00:36:17.360
against a certain amount of
losses from the banks, but

00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:19.030
they went through
them completely.

00:36:19.030 --> 00:36:20.650
And then they were bankrupt.

00:36:20.650 --> 00:36:22.510
So, the insurer went bankrupt.

00:36:22.510 --> 00:36:25.330
What then happened is, the
United States government

00:36:25.330 --> 00:36:27.330
picked up the tab.

00:36:27.330 --> 00:36:33.840
And the total tab was
$150 billion.

00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:35.590
And that restored confidence.

00:36:35.590 --> 00:36:39.610
I guess, the government
had to do that.

00:36:39.610 --> 00:36:42.360
And the FSLIC no
longer exists.

00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:45.520
Savings and loans are now
insured by the Federal Deposit

00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:47.430
Insurance Corporation.

00:36:47.430 --> 00:36:50.290
So, you know, these institutions
really don't

00:36:50.290 --> 00:36:53.680
necessarily represent
the real insurance.

00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:55.520
You have to always see
beyond institutions.

00:36:55.520 --> 00:37:00.350
The FSLIC was encouraging
people to believe in the

00:37:00.350 --> 00:37:03.320
security of the banking system,
but it really wasn't

00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:04.310
the ultimate security.

00:37:04.310 --> 00:37:07.430
The ultimate security wasn't
even written down.

00:37:07.430 --> 00:37:12.610
It was the recognition by the
U.S. government, that if we

00:37:12.610 --> 00:37:17.050
let FSLIC fail, and we let all
these depositors in the

00:37:17.050 --> 00:37:20.150
savings and loans lose their
money, it's going to destroy

00:37:20.150 --> 00:37:23.260
the confidence that has kept
us away from bank runs.

00:37:23.260 --> 00:37:26.020
And the next thing are
commercial banks, or who

00:37:26.020 --> 00:37:28.140
knows, what else will happen.

00:37:28.140 --> 00:37:32.510
So what always happens is, the
government stands behind these

00:37:32.510 --> 00:37:35.380
promises, even if they weren't
made so clearly.

00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:41.970
There's another example, I'll
give you, which is more

00:37:41.970 --> 00:37:45.590
recent, of a bank run.

00:37:45.590 --> 00:37:51.160
And that occurred in the
United Kingdom in 2007.

00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:52.805
The bank was called
Northern Rock.

00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:02.910
And a rumor started -- this was
at the beginning of the

00:38:02.910 --> 00:38:05.970
financial crisis -- a rumor
started that Northern Rock

00:38:05.970 --> 00:38:08.520
held a lot of subprime
securities, and was going to

00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:09.620
go bankrupt.

00:38:09.620 --> 00:38:12.900
So, people rushed to Northern
Rock, and big lines formed

00:38:12.900 --> 00:38:15.020
outside of Northern Rock.

00:38:15.020 --> 00:38:17.080
People, they wanted to get
there first, because you

00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:19.080
thought, they're still handing
out the money.

00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:22.510
I want to be there first. And
then, newspaper photographers

00:38:22.510 --> 00:38:25.490
photographed the crowd outside
the bank, and people thought,

00:38:25.490 --> 00:38:28.810
well, this is just like 1933 and
the huge banking crisis.

00:38:32.460 --> 00:38:40.830
Now, actually, the U.K.
government did have deposit

00:38:40.830 --> 00:38:46.740
insurance, but the deposit
insurance in the U.K. would

00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:53.190
insure fully all deposits
up to GBP 3,000.

00:38:53.190 --> 00:39:04.560
And then, it gave 90% insurance
up to GBP 75,000.

00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:07.120
After that, you were
out of luck.

00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:10.250
So, why was there a bank run
on Northern Rock when there

00:39:10.250 --> 00:39:11.850
was deposit insurance?

00:39:11.850 --> 00:39:12.530
Well, I tell you.

00:39:12.530 --> 00:39:16.170
It was people who had more than
GBP 3,000 in the bank,

00:39:16.170 --> 00:39:18.520
very simple.

00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:22.080
And so, you know, they didn't
really have enough deposit

00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:23.390
insurance to stop a run.

00:39:23.390 --> 00:39:28.120
So Mervyn King, who's head of
the Bank of England, just

00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:31.850
decided, you know what, we'll
bail everybody out.

00:39:31.850 --> 00:39:32.910
No questions.

00:39:32.910 --> 00:39:35.800
Forget our deposit
insurance scheme.

00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:37.620
And that stopped the run.

00:39:37.620 --> 00:39:40.940
So again, it happened the same
way in the United Kingdom.

00:39:40.940 --> 00:39:47.990
The deposit insurance stopped
it, before it was any problem.

00:39:47.990 --> 00:39:52.020
So, the United Kingdom has never
had a bank run failure

00:39:52.020 --> 00:39:56.940
since 1866.

00:39:56.940 --> 00:40:00.620
It's not really because of any
deposit insurance scheme.

00:40:00.620 --> 00:40:03.065
It's about the Bank of England,
which is their

00:40:03.065 --> 00:40:07.670
central bank, and what it does
to maintain confidence.

00:40:07.670 --> 00:40:09.340
Other countries handle
it differently.

00:40:09.340 --> 00:40:19.480
I was going to mention, in
Germany, IKB Deutsche

00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:30.200
Industriebank, in 2007.

00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:32.890
This is a German bank that
German depositors

00:40:32.890 --> 00:40:34.000
put their money in.

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:39.060
And it had invested a lot
in subprime securities.

00:40:39.060 --> 00:40:41.610
And it was in trouble, and
there were starting to be

00:40:41.610 --> 00:40:43.800
worries of a run on them.

00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:47.370
The German government didn't
even wait for a bank run.

00:40:47.370 --> 00:40:58.330
They just bailed them out, and
it cost them EUR 1.5 billion.

00:40:58.330 --> 00:41:00.920
But again, the governments
know that they want to

00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:03.540
maintain confidence,
and so they do it.

00:41:03.540 --> 00:41:06.730
They do what they have to do.

00:41:06.730 --> 00:41:11.130
Now, I want to go to bank
regulation, more generally.

00:41:11.130 --> 00:41:15.716
If you are insuring banks, then
you'd better regulate

00:41:15.716 --> 00:41:18.210
them, because there's a
moral hazard problem.

00:41:18.210 --> 00:41:21.670
I just described a moral hazard
problem for a company

00:41:21.670 --> 00:41:24.480
that borrows money from a bank,
but there's moral hazard

00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:27.240
problems for banks as well.

00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:29.880
Namely, banks can do
the same trick.

00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:31.970
I said, go to the racetrack.

00:41:31.970 --> 00:41:33.720
Borrow money and go
to the racetrack.

00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:35.820
Banks can do that, same thing.

00:41:35.820 --> 00:41:37.560
Except, they wouldn't actually
go to the racetrack.

00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:41.270
They would pick some really
risky business venture.

00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:46.630
And if it fails, then it all
falls to the deposit insurer.

00:41:46.630 --> 00:41:49.240
This is a fundamental lesson
of insurance, whenever you

00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:51.310
insure something, you've got to

00:41:51.310 --> 00:41:53.660
regulate the person insured.

00:41:53.660 --> 00:41:56.430
Because once you've taken a risk
from their shoulders, you

00:41:56.430 --> 00:41:59.730
create moral hazard for them.

00:41:59.730 --> 00:42:04.400
And so, bank regulation
is very important.

00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:08.600
So, I was going to talk mostly
here about the kind of bank

00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:12.630
regulation that has an
international dimension.

00:42:12.630 --> 00:42:17.370
And so, what I wanted to talk
about is the Basel bank

00:42:17.370 --> 00:42:24.500
regulations that were generated
by an international

00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:27.165
organization in Basel,
Switzerland.

00:42:33.370 --> 00:42:40.490
After the savings and loan
crisis was Basel I. It was an

00:42:40.490 --> 00:42:45.030
international meeting that
published a set of

00:42:45.030 --> 00:42:49.670
recommendations for all the
countries of the world to

00:42:49.670 --> 00:42:51.320
regulate their bank.

00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:53.360
The idea was that there
should be some

00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:55.220
coherence across countries.

00:42:55.220 --> 00:42:58.850
If one country regulates its
bank very stiffly, that's

00:42:58.850 --> 00:43:01.110
going to drive business
out of that country

00:43:01.110 --> 00:43:02.860
and into other countries.

00:43:02.860 --> 00:43:05.010
Also, there should be some
standardization.

00:43:05.010 --> 00:43:08.220
It helps the world economy, if
everybody knows that all the

00:43:08.220 --> 00:43:11.250
banks of the world have
similar regulations.

00:43:11.250 --> 00:43:14.000
But Basel, the Basel Committee,
as it's called,

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:15.890
that created the
recommendations,

00:43:15.890 --> 00:43:17.810
had no legal authority.

00:43:17.810 --> 00:43:20.780
All it could do is recommend.

00:43:20.780 --> 00:43:25.160
But it did recommend bank
regulations, and these were

00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:27.760
widely adopted around
the world.

00:43:30.790 --> 00:43:32.610
Each country could make
modifications,

00:43:32.610 --> 00:43:34.060
whatever they want.

00:43:34.060 --> 00:43:37.220
You can't order countries
around, but they often

00:43:37.220 --> 00:43:40.350
followed the Basel
recommendations.

00:43:40.350 --> 00:43:46.850
In Basel II, they met again in
the 2000's, and they issued

00:43:46.850 --> 00:43:51.950
recommendations in 2004.

00:43:51.950 --> 00:43:54.530
What they said in Basel II was,
the banking system was

00:43:54.530 --> 00:43:57.330
getting so much more complicated
that they had to

00:43:57.330 --> 00:43:58.970
think more about how to do it.

00:43:58.970 --> 00:44:01.770
Now, there's all these
complicated derivatives and

00:44:01.770 --> 00:44:07.540
special purpose vehicles, and
so they had to update their

00:44:07.540 --> 00:44:08.830
regulations.

00:44:08.830 --> 00:44:12.760
Unfortunately, Basel II has
suffered a reputation blow,

00:44:12.760 --> 00:44:16.210
because right after Basel
II we had the

00:44:16.210 --> 00:44:17.510
world financial crisis.

00:44:17.510 --> 00:44:19.640
So, they didn't do
something right.

00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:22.930
They didn't really fix the
system in Basel II.

00:44:22.930 --> 00:44:26.670
So, that brought us to
Basel III, which

00:44:26.670 --> 00:44:30.520
is the latest version.

00:44:30.520 --> 00:44:35.190
And they issued their
report in 2010.

00:44:35.190 --> 00:44:40.360
And also in 2010, the G-20
nations meeting in Seoul,

00:44:40.360 --> 00:44:47.070
Korea, expressed their support
for Basel III.

00:44:47.070 --> 00:44:51.300
So, Basel III is the current
world regulation standard.

00:44:55.550 --> 00:44:59.960
But it's phased in gradually,
and it won't be fully phased

00:44:59.960 --> 00:45:02.930
in until 2019.

00:45:02.930 --> 00:45:05.650
They didn't want to put it in
all at once, because the world

00:45:05.650 --> 00:45:08.450
is in a financial crisis, and
it would be too stressful.

00:45:08.450 --> 00:45:12.590
So, it has a slow phase-in.

00:45:12.590 --> 00:45:17.500
And some of the details
haven't even

00:45:17.500 --> 00:45:20.420
been worked out yet.

00:45:20.420 --> 00:45:23.580
The G-20 countries have agreed,
in principle, that

00:45:23.580 --> 00:45:27.990
these regulations are where
we'll go, but details have yet

00:45:27.990 --> 00:45:29.240
to be worked out.

00:45:32.300 --> 00:45:34.240
You know, bank regulation
is a big business.

00:45:34.240 --> 00:45:37.230
We could have a whole
semester on studying

00:45:37.230 --> 00:45:39.380
what these guys do.

00:45:39.380 --> 00:45:42.310
So, I just wanted to give
you kind of a caricature

00:45:42.310 --> 00:45:43.680
of what's in Basel.

00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:45.980
It's also in Fabozzi et al.,
the Fabozzi et al.

00:45:45.980 --> 00:45:49.040
textbook, which is
copyright 2010.

00:45:49.040 --> 00:45:51.430
You'd think this would be
in it, but it's not.

00:45:51.430 --> 00:45:54.350
Basel I and Basel II are
in Fabozzi et al.

00:45:54.350 --> 00:45:57.730
Basel III isn't, because it
didn't come in until the end

00:45:57.730 --> 00:46:03.050
of 2010, and so it didn't
make it in time to

00:46:03.050 --> 00:46:06.220
appear in your book.

00:46:06.220 --> 00:46:13.710
But I wanted to just give you
a simple account of all the

00:46:13.710 --> 00:46:18.130
Basel agreements, and some
sense of where we

00:46:18.130 --> 00:46:21.780
are with Basel III.

00:46:21.780 --> 00:46:25.280
They're all about banks
having enough money.

00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:27.400
You know, not taking
on too much.

00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:29.620
Enough money for the
risks they take.

00:46:29.620 --> 00:46:38.140
Let me start with Basel I,
because part of Basel I is

00:46:38.140 --> 00:46:39.990
enforced in all three of them.

00:46:39.990 --> 00:46:47.010
And there's a concept called
''risk-weighted assets,''

00:46:47.010 --> 00:46:53.630
which is in Basel I, and
Basel II and Basel III,

00:46:53.630 --> 00:46:56.280
essentially the same.

00:46:56.280 --> 00:46:57.690
OK, so, here's the idea.

00:47:00.490 --> 00:47:03.790
We're going to put capital
requirements based on

00:47:03.790 --> 00:47:05.552
risk-weighted assets.

00:47:05.552 --> 00:47:07.050
Now what does that mean?

00:47:07.050 --> 00:47:11.330
That means, that banks cannot
take too many risks.

00:47:14.420 --> 00:47:17.280
They have to have enough money
to back them up for

00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:18.740
the risks they take.

00:47:18.740 --> 00:47:20.970
And we'll call that
money capital.

00:47:20.970 --> 00:47:21.930
It's not money.

00:47:21.930 --> 00:47:26.220
It's not cash, but it's assets
that they can use to get them

00:47:26.220 --> 00:47:29.680
out of trouble, if the risky
assets do badly.

00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:33.120
So, if we're going to have
a requirement on how much

00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:39.700
capital a bank holds, we have
also to define their risks.

00:47:39.700 --> 00:47:45.750
And so, Basel I had a very
simple formula to compute

00:47:45.750 --> 00:47:47.600
risk-weighted assets.

00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:51.070
Well, it's very simple, until
you get into all the details.

00:47:51.070 --> 00:47:53.820
And so, you'll see
the definition of

00:47:53.820 --> 00:47:55.470
risk-weighted assets.

00:47:55.470 --> 00:48:00.110
It's in table 3.3 in
Fabozzi et al.

00:48:00.110 --> 00:48:02.390
But basically, here it is.

00:48:02.390 --> 00:48:05.480
There's four categories
of assets.

00:48:05.480 --> 00:48:10.290
The 0% weight, the 20% weight,
the 50% weight,

00:48:10.290 --> 00:48:12.080
and the 100% weight.

00:48:12.080 --> 00:48:16.220
The higher the weight,
it means more risky.

00:48:16.220 --> 00:48:19.900
So, where will I write these?

00:48:19.900 --> 00:48:21.220
I'll do it up here.

00:48:21.220 --> 00:48:26.740
Now, we're talking about all
three, Basel I, II, and III.

00:48:26.740 --> 00:48:37.530
0% are national -- well, I'll
say OECD government bonds,

00:48:37.530 --> 00:48:40.350
national government bonds.

00:48:40.350 --> 00:48:45.850
The OECD is the organization for
European Cooperation and

00:48:45.850 --> 00:48:47.060
Development.

00:48:47.060 --> 00:48:51.130
And they represent advanced,
stable European countries.

00:48:51.130 --> 00:48:57.320
And U.S. government bonds
are included among them.

00:48:57.320 --> 00:48:58.570
What else?

00:49:05.660 --> 00:49:06.730
Yes, basically that's it.

00:49:06.730 --> 00:49:08.470
Now, there might be something
else in there, and I'm sure

00:49:08.470 --> 00:49:11.990
there is, but this is the
simplest. 0% weight, because

00:49:11.990 --> 00:49:13.860
these have 0% risk.

00:49:13.860 --> 00:49:15.640
There's no risk.

00:49:15.640 --> 00:49:18.730
So, banks can hold all they want
of these and they don't

00:49:18.730 --> 00:49:21.070
have to hold any capital.

00:49:21.070 --> 00:49:29.550
Then, next up is 20% weight, and
that's municipal bonds, or

00:49:29.550 --> 00:49:35.170
local bonds, that's not issued
by the national governments

00:49:35.170 --> 00:49:37.480
but issued by a city or state.

00:49:37.480 --> 00:49:39.940
We're having a municipal
bond crisis now.

00:49:39.940 --> 00:49:42.850
They're suddenly showing their
risk, and we're worried about

00:49:42.850 --> 00:49:45.620
defaults on them, so Basel
I was right to

00:49:45.620 --> 00:49:47.730
give them some weight.

00:49:47.730 --> 00:49:50.660
They gave them a 20% weight,
because they thought,

00:49:50.660 --> 00:49:54.520
municipal bonds are
pretty safe.

00:49:54.520 --> 00:49:57.310
They're not as safe as national
government bonds,

00:49:57.310 --> 00:50:00.550
because there's examples
of default.

00:50:00.550 --> 00:50:02.455
But they're also included --

00:50:02.455 --> 00:50:04.660
there's a long list of
what they include --

00:50:04.660 --> 00:50:09.110
but notably Fannie
and Freddie --

00:50:09.110 --> 00:50:12.080
these are the two mortgage
lenders in the United States--

00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:14.960
were included with
20% weights.

00:50:14.960 --> 00:50:17.040
Because people thought, these
guys are really safe, and

00:50:17.040 --> 00:50:19.130
anyway, the U.S. government
backs them up.

00:50:19.130 --> 00:50:20.690
Although the U.S. government
said, it

00:50:20.690 --> 00:50:21.810
wouldn't back them up.

00:50:21.810 --> 00:50:24.840
But you know, we all know,
they're going to back them up,

00:50:24.840 --> 00:50:27.850
and indeed, they did back them
up when they failed.

00:50:27.850 --> 00:50:33.060
But Fannie and Freddie, prior
to the crisis, started

00:50:33.060 --> 00:50:36.920
increasingly investing in
subprime mortgages.

00:50:40.650 --> 00:50:44.270
And they were issuing subprime
mortgage securities that were

00:50:44.270 --> 00:50:48.130
really very risky and eventually
went kaput.

00:50:48.130 --> 00:50:52.600
Basel I didn't know that, or
Basel II and Basel III still,

00:50:52.600 --> 00:50:54.290
they just gave them
a 20% weight.

00:50:54.290 --> 00:50:57.210
That was a big mistake, and
that's where part of the

00:50:57.210 --> 00:50:59.250
banking crisis comes.

00:50:59.250 --> 00:51:02.520
Then, there's 50% weight,
and that's for

00:51:02.520 --> 00:51:06.500
mortgages, home mortgages.

00:51:06.500 --> 00:51:10.030
The Basel people thought, there
could be some big real

00:51:10.030 --> 00:51:11.760
estate crisis.

00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:15.320
You know, it's something to
worry about, so there's more

00:51:15.320 --> 00:51:16.220
weight than that.

00:51:16.220 --> 00:51:21.100
And then, we have 100% on
everything else, but notably

00:51:21.100 --> 00:51:24.380
loans, like commercial
loans to businesses.

00:51:30.560 --> 00:51:32.740
So, those are the weights.

00:51:32.740 --> 00:51:34.740
And so, I just wanted to go
through a simple example.

00:51:34.740 --> 00:51:43.200
Suppose you are a bank, and
you have $400 million in

00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:47.250
assets on your balance sheet.

00:51:47.250 --> 00:51:49.140
These are things that
you as a bank own.

00:51:49.140 --> 00:51:53.850
And let's say you have 100 in
government bonds, federal

00:51:53.850 --> 00:51:55.770
government bonds.

00:51:55.770 --> 00:52:00.260
100 in Fannie Mae,
$100 million.

00:52:00.260 --> 00:52:06.170
And you have 100 in mortgages
that you own directly.

00:52:06.170 --> 00:52:09.010
And you have 100 in
commercial loans.

00:52:12.380 --> 00:52:16.340
So, your total assets
are $400 million.

00:52:16.340 --> 00:52:19.850
But you've got to know what your
risk-weighted assets are.

00:52:19.850 --> 00:52:21.260
What are your risk-weighted
assets?

00:52:21.260 --> 00:52:23.910
Well I take the 100 -- and
Fabozzi et al. goes through an

00:52:23.910 --> 00:52:26.750
example too, but this
is very easy --

00:52:26.750 --> 00:52:30.300
I multiply the 100
by 0, I get 0.

00:52:30.300 --> 00:52:36.880
I multiply this 100 by
20%, so that gives me

00:52:36.880 --> 00:52:38.210
$20 million, right?

00:52:38.210 --> 00:52:42.020
I multiply the mortgages by 50%,
it gives me $50 million,

00:52:42.020 --> 00:52:45.730
and I've got to throw
all these in.

00:52:45.730 --> 00:52:47.840
So, what does that add up to?

00:52:47.840 --> 00:52:54.280
It's $170 million RWA,
risk-weighted assets.

00:52:54.280 --> 00:53:00.060
It's 0 plus 20, plus
50, plus 100.

00:53:00.060 --> 00:53:04.570
So, those are my risk-weighted
assets, and then, the amount

00:53:04.570 --> 00:53:09.070
of capital that I have to hold
is a percentage of the

00:53:09.070 --> 00:53:10.320
risk-weighted assets.

00:53:12.600 --> 00:53:15.250
I could go through Basel I,
Basel II, Basel III, they kept

00:53:15.250 --> 00:53:18.760
changing these percentages,
as they went along.

00:53:18.760 --> 00:53:21.620
So, I'm just going to talk
about Basel III, because

00:53:21.620 --> 00:53:22.900
that's going forward,
all right?

00:53:25.660 --> 00:53:27.650
And Basel III is complicated,
too.

00:53:27.650 --> 00:53:31.590
I'm going to just talk to
you about common equity

00:53:31.590 --> 00:53:33.870
requirements.

00:53:33.870 --> 00:53:39.900
So, Basel III says --

00:53:39.900 --> 00:53:44.264
it's an interesting and
creative construct --

00:53:44.264 --> 00:54:01.900
common equity must be 4.5%
of RWA at all times.

00:54:01.900 --> 00:54:04.540
But I'll add to that.

00:54:04.540 --> 00:54:17.010
They have plus 2.5%, what
they call a capital

00:54:17.010 --> 00:54:24.725
conservation buffer.

00:54:24.725 --> 00:54:29.860
And so, that adds up to you
7%, and I'll explain.

00:54:29.860 --> 00:54:36.830
You absolutely have to have 4.5%
as common equity, but if

00:54:36.830 --> 00:54:39.380
you don't also have
another 2.5%, you

00:54:39.380 --> 00:54:41.660
can't pay out any dividends.

00:54:41.660 --> 00:54:43.020
That's not so good.

00:54:43.020 --> 00:54:46.930
So, in reality, you
better keep 7%.

00:54:46.930 --> 00:54:50.400
So effectively, Basel III --

00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:58.970
this is Basel III, it's not in
your textbook, but it's coming

00:54:58.970 --> 00:55:02.690
all over the world, 7%.

00:55:02.690 --> 00:55:04.670
Now incidentally, the
interesting thing about Basel

00:55:04.670 --> 00:55:08.620
III, they're thinking
creatively, they added another

00:55:08.620 --> 00:55:12.850
buffer, called a countercyclical
buffer.

00:55:16.540 --> 00:55:17.790
Well, that's not added
automatically.

00:55:20.394 --> 00:55:28.860
And that's another 2.5%, but
only if the regulators in the

00:55:28.860 --> 00:55:30.870
country choose to impose it.

00:55:30.870 --> 00:55:35.040
And here's the idea: We have
to stop bubbles before they

00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:36.640
burst, right?

00:55:36.640 --> 00:55:39.580
So, suppose you think that a
bubble is building up in your

00:55:39.580 --> 00:55:43.000
country, then the regulators
are asked by Basel, if they

00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:47.790
make that judgment, to add
another 2.5% to the capital

00:55:47.790 --> 00:55:51.220
requirement, while
it's booming.

00:55:51.220 --> 00:55:53.940
You don't wait until the crisis
to do this, because

00:55:53.940 --> 00:55:56.240
then they'll all be in trouble,
and if you tighten up

00:55:56.240 --> 00:55:59.110
on banks then, they'll stop
making loans, and that will

00:55:59.110 --> 00:56:00.320
crash the whole economy.

00:56:00.320 --> 00:56:02.630
You have got to tighten up
when times are good.

00:56:02.630 --> 00:56:07.850
So, that adds up to 9.5%.

00:56:07.850 --> 00:56:11.730
So, you'd have to hold capital
equal to 9.5% of your

00:56:11.730 --> 00:56:13.500
risk-weighted assets.

00:56:13.500 --> 00:56:17.265
But presumably, the normal
number is 7%.

00:56:17.265 --> 00:56:21.260
So, let me just go through for
this bank here, which has $400

00:56:21.260 --> 00:56:24.640
million in assets.

00:56:24.640 --> 00:56:26.970
What is their requirement?

00:56:26.970 --> 00:56:30.910
Well, we figured out that they
have $170 million in

00:56:30.910 --> 00:56:33.350
risk-weighted assets.

00:56:33.350 --> 00:56:40.910
Multiply that by 7%, and that
gives you, I think it's $11.9

00:56:40.910 --> 00:56:49.526
million that they have. So,
your common equity must be

00:56:49.526 --> 00:56:55.750
$11.9 million.

00:56:55.750 --> 00:56:57.230
So, you go to your
balance sheet.

00:56:57.230 --> 00:56:59.010
We showed balance sheets
in an earlier --

00:56:59.010 --> 00:57:00.260
STUDENT: It's common equity plus
the first buffer, right?

00:57:02.940 --> 00:57:05.012
PROFESSOR ROBERT SHILLER:
I'm sorry?

00:57:05.012 --> 00:57:06.220
STUDENT: The $ 11.9
million is --

00:57:06.220 --> 00:57:07.360
PROFESSOR ROBERT SHILLER:
Oh, did I do with --

00:57:07.360 --> 00:57:16.220
yes, I'm sorry, that's
7% of $170 million.

00:57:16.220 --> 00:57:21.460
You don't actually have to
hold this buffer, but it

00:57:21.460 --> 00:57:23.020
limits you if you don't.

00:57:23.020 --> 00:57:26.380
And so practically,
most banks will.

00:57:26.380 --> 00:57:28.570
So then, you go to look on your
balance sheet, and you

00:57:28.570 --> 00:57:32.700
see, hey, we're lucky, we
have got $12.9 million.

00:57:32.700 --> 00:57:35.110
Let's say, I just
made that up.

00:57:35.110 --> 00:57:36.360
How do you get common equity?

00:57:36.360 --> 00:57:39.360
You take the total assets in
your balance sheet, you

00:57:39.360 --> 00:57:42.460
subtract off all of the
liabilities, all

00:57:42.460 --> 00:57:44.230
the money you owed.

00:57:44.230 --> 00:57:46.150
And that gives you shareholders'
equity, but that

00:57:46.150 --> 00:57:49.360
has two components, common
equity and preferred equity,

00:57:49.360 --> 00:57:51.690
so you've got to subtract off
the preferred equity.

00:57:51.690 --> 00:57:55.860
But it's a sense of how much
extra resources you have.

00:57:55.860 --> 00:57:58.120
After you've paid off
all your debts, you

00:57:58.120 --> 00:58:04.850
still have $12.9 million.

00:58:04.850 --> 00:58:06.710
You say, hey, we're good.

00:58:06.710 --> 00:58:09.880
We've got an extra
million dollars.

00:58:09.880 --> 00:58:12.410
So then, you bring that up at
the board meeting and say,

00:58:12.410 --> 00:58:15.250
we're satisfying Basel III,
isn't that great?

00:58:15.250 --> 00:58:18.530
But someone at the board might
say, but wait a minute, that

00:58:18.530 --> 00:58:20.910
means we have $1 million
too much.

00:58:20.910 --> 00:58:24.110
It's just sitting there, we're
not even using it.

00:58:24.110 --> 00:58:27.070
Let's lend it out.

00:58:27.070 --> 00:58:29.510
I'm sorry, let's use it
up, not lend it out.

00:58:29.510 --> 00:58:32.210
How do you use it up?

00:58:32.210 --> 00:58:35.280
You've now got more than the
amount of capital required.

00:58:35.280 --> 00:58:37.270
You've got another
million dollars.

00:58:37.270 --> 00:58:39.940
You could lend out $1 million,
but think about it.

00:58:39.940 --> 00:58:45.990
You can borrow more
and lend more.

00:58:45.990 --> 00:58:50.020
Or you can borrow more and
take other assets.

00:58:50.020 --> 00:58:51.340
And you can go beyond
$1 million.

00:58:53.920 --> 00:58:54.895
Let's consider this.

00:58:54.895 --> 00:58:56.450
So, do you understand
the situation?

00:58:56.450 --> 00:58:57.940
That we've done our
accounting.

00:58:57.940 --> 00:59:01.800
We have $170 million in
risk-weighted assets.

00:59:01.800 --> 00:59:06.515
We have a requirement,
therefore, of $11.9 million in

00:59:06.515 --> 00:59:07.440
common equity.

00:59:07.440 --> 00:59:09.540
We have an extra million
dollars.

00:59:09.540 --> 00:59:12.330
Let's consider buying different
kinds of assets.

00:59:12.330 --> 00:59:14.480
How about buying Fannie
Mae bonds?

00:59:20.280 --> 00:59:22.580
How much more can you buy?

00:59:22.580 --> 00:59:24.560
Well, you've got $1 million.

00:59:24.560 --> 00:59:26.830
If you're going to buy more,
you're going to add both

00:59:26.830 --> 00:59:27.890
assets and liability.

00:59:27.890 --> 00:59:30.240
You're going to borrow money,
and you're going to buy more.

00:59:30.240 --> 00:59:32.480
So, you're going to add both
assets and liabilities to your

00:59:32.480 --> 00:59:34.020
balance sheet.

00:59:34.020 --> 00:59:40.060
How far can you go without
violating the capital

00:59:40.060 --> 00:59:40.910
requirement?

00:59:40.910 --> 00:59:46.080
Well, the amount you can buy of
Fannie and Freddie bonds is

00:59:46.080 --> 00:59:53.540
$1 million all over
0.2 times 0.07.

00:59:53.540 --> 00:59:56.855
And that's about $70
million worth of

00:59:56.855 --> 00:59:58.360
Fannie and Freddie bonds.

00:59:58.360 --> 01:00:02.012
Because you add that to this
mix, then it will raise your

01:00:02.012 --> 01:00:06.430
risk-weighted assets by
exactly $1 million.

01:00:06.430 --> 01:00:11.960
So, you can buy $70 million of
Fannie and Freddie bonds

01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:17.135
according to this weighted
asset calculation.

01:00:17.135 --> 01:00:18.120
You see that?

01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:20.360
Well, how about making
loans to small

01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:22.740
businesses in our community?

01:00:22.740 --> 01:00:26.100
Well, that's 100%
risk-weighting.

01:00:26.100 --> 01:00:31.270
So that means, I can make loans
of $1 million all over

01:00:31.270 --> 01:00:36.890
0.07, and that's about
$14 million.

01:00:36.890 --> 01:00:37.880
So, this is what
you would tell.

01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:39.830
You're at a board meeting
and you're saying,

01:00:39.830 --> 01:00:41.280
let's consider that.

01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:45.460
We're going to stay within the
requirements, we can buy $70

01:00:45.460 --> 01:00:49.590
million of Fannie bonds,
or we can make $14

01:00:49.590 --> 01:00:50.860
million more in loans.

01:00:50.860 --> 01:00:53.130
But at the board meeting,
someone might say, you know,

01:00:53.130 --> 01:00:56.120
$70 million sounds better than
$14 million, I think we should

01:00:56.120 --> 01:01:00.220
do Fannie bonds, and tell all
the guys with small businesses

01:01:00.220 --> 01:01:03.200
coming by, tough luck.

01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:06.590
You know, we don't have
any money for you.

01:01:06.590 --> 01:01:07.880
So, we see what it's doing.

01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:09.360
Its pushing people --

01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:12.740
the Basel requirements, and
these are Basel II, or Basel I

01:01:12.740 --> 01:01:16.530
requirements, we're pushing
banks toward investing in

01:01:16.530 --> 01:01:21.770
subprime loans issued by Fannie
Mae as against lending

01:01:21.770 --> 01:01:23.190
to businesses.

01:01:23.190 --> 01:01:26.500
And people are starting to
wonder about that now.

01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:30.170
But you have to say, isn't the
prosperity of the country

01:01:30.170 --> 01:01:34.000
determined by the businesses?

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:37.230
When you're making a subprime
loan, what is a subprime loan?

01:01:37.230 --> 01:01:40.900
It's a loan to someone with
bad credit, with bad

01:01:40.900 --> 01:01:43.490
employment history,
to buy a house.

01:01:43.490 --> 01:01:48.960
So, we have created an incentive
for banks to lend to

01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:52.640
those people rather than
to businesses.

01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:55.690
And so there are critics
of Basel, all the Basel

01:01:55.690 --> 01:01:59.140
agreements, saying, it's
counterproductive.

01:01:59.140 --> 01:02:01.710
We shouldn't have done this.

01:02:01.710 --> 01:02:03.740
These weights were wrong.

01:02:03.740 --> 01:02:06.150
There shouldn't have been so
little risk-weighting on

01:02:06.150 --> 01:02:08.090
Fannie Mae.

01:02:08.090 --> 01:02:10.860
But then, the Basel people would
say, look, we can't get

01:02:10.860 --> 01:02:11.700
it exactly right.

01:02:11.700 --> 01:02:13.710
We thought Fannie and Freddie
-- and we're right, they

01:02:13.710 --> 01:02:14.770
haven't failed.

01:02:14.770 --> 01:02:19.070
Our job at Basel is to prevent a
run on the banks, so we want

01:02:19.070 --> 01:02:20.530
banks to be sound.

01:02:20.530 --> 01:02:23.290
And maybe you're right, maybe
businesses should be

01:02:23.290 --> 01:02:25.480
encouraged, but it's
not our department.

01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:27.760
We're trying to prevent
bank failure.

01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:30.750
So, these rules stick, and
they're still with us today

01:02:30.750 --> 01:02:32.480
under Basel III.

01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:36.090
If you want to subsidize small
businesses, like in the United

01:02:36.090 --> 01:02:39.410
States we have the Small
Business Administration, that

01:02:39.410 --> 01:02:41.100
gives loans to small
businesses.

01:02:41.100 --> 01:02:46.270
But Basel III is not
going to do that.

01:02:46.270 --> 01:02:56.330
So, I said I would talk about
other financial crises, and

01:02:56.330 --> 01:02:58.760
let me talk briefly about a
few, and then I'm going to

01:02:58.760 --> 01:03:01.100
have to wrap up.

01:03:01.100 --> 01:03:08.450
The crisis that we have been
through was a worldwide

01:03:08.450 --> 01:03:16.740
crisis, starting in 2007,
peaking in 2008 and 2009.

01:03:16.740 --> 01:03:19.140
And it caused a worldwide
recession.

01:03:19.140 --> 01:03:21.720
So, it's especially vivid
in our memory.

01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:25.830
But I want to just reflect
that these crises --

01:03:25.830 --> 01:03:31.030
we've had banking crises so
many times in history that

01:03:31.030 --> 01:03:33.970
it's not a unique event.

01:03:33.970 --> 01:03:36.110
And I just wanted to
remind ourselves

01:03:36.110 --> 01:03:40.270
of a few other crises.

01:03:40.270 --> 01:03:46.500
I'm going to start with the
Mexican crisis, our neighbor

01:03:46.500 --> 01:03:56.530
to the south, of 1994 to 1995.

01:03:56.530 --> 01:04:00.960
Under President Salinas,
the government

01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:04.630
privatized Mexican banks.

01:04:04.630 --> 01:04:09.810
Salinas was a Harvard-educated
economist who wanted to

01:04:09.810 --> 01:04:12.580
modernize the Mexican economy.

01:04:12.580 --> 01:04:17.900
And they privatized government
banks, and turned it over to

01:04:17.900 --> 01:04:20.750
the free market, and they
forgot to regulate it.

01:04:20.750 --> 01:04:26.210
And so, it led to a
bank lending boom.

01:04:26.210 --> 01:04:35.420
In 1988, lending
was 10% of GDP.

01:04:35.420 --> 01:04:42.820
In 1994, up to 40% of GDP.

01:04:42.820 --> 01:04:47.540
Salinas did not stop this.

01:04:47.540 --> 01:04:51.630
And it led to a boom in Mexico,
because lending was

01:04:51.630 --> 01:04:55.300
going wild, everything was
happening really fast, and it

01:04:55.300 --> 01:04:58.080
led to a bubble and
a boom in Mexico.

01:04:58.080 --> 01:05:00.570
And there should have
been a regulator who

01:05:00.570 --> 01:05:02.550
said, stop it, anyway.

01:05:02.550 --> 01:05:07.450
But there wasn't effective
regulation, because Mexico had

01:05:07.450 --> 01:05:11.930
deregulated but it hadn't set
up the banking institutions,

01:05:11.930 --> 01:05:14.210
the regulatory institutions.

01:05:14.210 --> 01:05:20.410
So, it developed an atmosphere
in Mexico that, you know, I

01:05:20.410 --> 01:05:23.500
don't worry about the possible
crisis, because the Mexican

01:05:23.500 --> 01:05:25.420
government will bail
everybody out.

01:05:25.420 --> 01:05:29.610
And, you know, they couldn't
bail everyone out, it turns

01:05:29.610 --> 01:05:31.840
out, there was a collapse.

01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:37.780
So, Salinas was replaced by
Yale-educated Ernesto Zedillo.

01:05:37.780 --> 01:05:40.420
I shouldn't put it that way.

01:05:40.420 --> 01:05:45.660
And the Mexican banking system
was destroyed by this crisis.

01:05:45.660 --> 01:05:49.180
And what ended up happening is
that most Mexican banks were

01:05:49.180 --> 01:05:51.700
taken over by foreign banks.

01:05:51.700 --> 01:05:57.080
And it was followed by an
economy that was heavily

01:05:57.080 --> 01:05:58.330
damaged by a crisis.

01:06:04.230 --> 01:06:06.370
But Mexico recovered.

01:06:06.370 --> 01:06:13.330
And 1994 and 1995 was unique
to that country.

01:06:13.330 --> 01:06:18.290
It was a terrible recession
that hit Mexico briefly.

01:06:18.290 --> 01:06:19.540
That's one example.

01:06:21.460 --> 01:06:24.350
But again, it was a regulatory
failure that did it.

01:06:24.350 --> 01:06:27.580
If you allow the moral hazard
to develop, if you allow

01:06:27.580 --> 01:06:31.350
people to think that, hey, let's
make all these loans.

01:06:31.350 --> 01:06:33.840
I think it'll work out, but
maybe it won't, and if it

01:06:33.840 --> 01:06:37.855
doesn't, hey, we have friends
in Mexico City, so we'll all

01:06:37.855 --> 01:06:39.550
be all right.

01:06:39.550 --> 01:06:52.970
The next example is the
Asian crisis of 1997.

01:06:52.970 --> 01:06:55.950
It's a very complicated crisis
involving a number of Asian

01:06:55.950 --> 01:07:00.840
countries, but it was heavily
related to bank lending.

01:07:00.840 --> 01:07:04.240
And international banks
had lent a lot of

01:07:04.240 --> 01:07:07.600
money to Asian countries.

01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:12.880
And the countries then had
loans that were --

01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:14.580
they were dependent
on loans --

01:07:14.580 --> 01:07:18.730
that were withdrawn when a sort
of a bank run occurred.

01:07:18.730 --> 01:07:23.340
It was something like a bank
run, because the international

01:07:23.340 --> 01:07:26.210
investors suddenly wanted to
withdraw their money from the

01:07:26.210 --> 01:07:28.170
Asian countries.

01:07:28.170 --> 01:07:40.100
And the Asian crisis started
in Thailand, and Korea, and

01:07:40.100 --> 01:07:44.015
Indonesia, and then it spread
all over the world.

01:07:44.015 --> 01:07:48.610
It reached Russia as a
consequence, and it's called

01:07:48.610 --> 01:07:50.880
the Russian Debt Crisis.

01:07:50.880 --> 01:07:54.420
It was a contagion effect.

01:07:54.420 --> 01:07:57.940
And it got all the way
down to Brazil.

01:07:57.940 --> 01:08:01.890
You wonder, why was Brazil
affected by an Asian crisis?

01:08:01.890 --> 01:08:07.510
Well, the world, it was
and is interlinked.

01:08:07.510 --> 01:08:12.510
So, it's experiences like this,
that encourages the G-20

01:08:12.510 --> 01:08:17.550
countries now to agree on bank
regulation, that will prevent

01:08:17.550 --> 01:08:20.149
this kind of collapse.

01:08:20.149 --> 01:08:24.899
And the last example I have is,
again, it's not -- this

01:08:24.899 --> 01:08:26.673
one is not so international.

01:08:26.673 --> 01:08:32.920
The Argentine crisis of 2002.

01:08:32.920 --> 01:08:38.630
This was, again, a complicated
crisis.

01:08:38.630 --> 01:08:41.620
But it involved the Argentine
government shutting down the

01:08:41.620 --> 01:08:45.370
banking system in Argentina.

01:08:45.370 --> 01:08:50.620
And I don't have much time
to talk about all this.

01:08:58.399 --> 01:09:02.340
The examples that I gave of
crises around the world, I

01:09:02.340 --> 01:09:06.370
went through them very quickly,
but let me just

01:09:06.370 --> 01:09:09.540
reiterate the themes that
I started out with.

01:09:09.540 --> 01:09:14.819
And that is that banks fill a

01:09:14.819 --> 01:09:17.880
fundamental role in our economy.

01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:19.630
They make things work.

01:09:19.630 --> 01:09:22.370
They solve moral hazard
problems. They solve adverse

01:09:22.370 --> 01:09:28.760
selection problems. They create
liquidity, so that

01:09:28.760 --> 01:09:33.319
businesses can function and
individuals can function.

01:09:33.319 --> 01:09:40.689
When the crisis develops,
we suddenly realize the

01:09:40.689 --> 01:09:45.720
importance of our banking system
in its absence or in

01:09:45.720 --> 01:09:50.190
its poor behavior.

01:09:50.190 --> 01:09:54.540
And so, I think there's an
attitude among a lot of people

01:09:54.540 --> 01:09:56.680
that they don't like regulators,
or they don't

01:09:56.680 --> 01:09:58.420
appreciate regulators.

01:09:58.420 --> 01:10:03.530
But in fact regulators are
people who are managing a very

01:10:03.530 --> 01:10:07.690
complicated system, which is
really important to our

01:10:07.690 --> 01:10:09.400
prosperity.

01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:13.550
If you look at causes of
economic disruptions, it's

01:10:13.550 --> 01:10:17.220
failures in our banking system
that seem often to be

01:10:17.220 --> 01:10:18.490
responsible.

01:10:18.490 --> 01:10:21.490
There's other things, like, for
example, an oil crisis can

01:10:21.490 --> 01:10:23.010
bring on a --

01:10:23.010 --> 01:10:25.410
it seems to be completely
independent of a banking

01:10:25.410 --> 01:10:29.240
crisis, but you take those two
together and you explain most

01:10:29.240 --> 01:10:30.900
economic crises.

01:10:30.900 --> 01:10:34.850
It's a very important thing to
get banks regulated right.

01:10:34.850 --> 01:10:38.710
Now what I didn't talk about in
this lecture is -- and I'm

01:10:38.710 --> 01:10:40.410
going to come back to this --

01:10:40.410 --> 01:10:42.260
is the shadow banking system.

01:10:42.260 --> 01:10:43.840
Let me just mention this
in anticipation.

01:10:52.394 --> 01:10:57.950
And that refers to other kinds
of companies, not officially

01:10:57.950 --> 01:11:02.770
banks, that are doing business
that resembles banking and is

01:11:02.770 --> 01:11:05.230
not regulated.

01:11:05.230 --> 01:11:11.880
So for example, Lehman Brothers
or Bear Stearns,

01:11:11.880 --> 01:11:15.330
which were major failures
that led to this crisis,

01:11:15.330 --> 01:11:17.370
they were not banks.

01:11:17.370 --> 01:11:18.760
Well, they're not commercial
banks.

01:11:18.760 --> 01:11:21.070
They're not under Basel III.

01:11:21.070 --> 01:11:24.310
They are investment banks, which
is a different animal

01:11:24.310 --> 01:11:26.510
and it's not regulated
by Basel III.

01:11:33.515 --> 01:11:38.630
Let me add innovation
in finance.

01:11:38.630 --> 01:11:41.830
It's making the financial world
harder and harder to

01:11:41.830 --> 01:11:42.670
understand.

01:11:42.670 --> 01:11:45.790
That's why we keep having Basel
I, Basel II, Basel III.

01:11:45.790 --> 01:11:50.090
There's going to be a Basel IV.
Financial systems are so

01:11:50.090 --> 01:11:52.000
much more complicated
than they were,

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.030
say, in the 19th century.

01:11:54.030 --> 01:11:55.120
There used to be a bank.

01:11:55.120 --> 01:11:57.430
You can see, there's one in
downtown New Haven that looks

01:11:57.430 --> 01:11:59.170
like a Greek temple.

01:11:59.170 --> 01:12:00.470
You probably didn't
even notice it.

01:12:00.470 --> 01:12:02.130
I looked at the corner stone.

01:12:02.130 --> 01:12:03.900
It was 19th century.

01:12:03.900 --> 01:12:05.790
It's a beautiful old building.

01:12:05.790 --> 01:12:06.830
Banks were like that.

01:12:06.830 --> 01:12:08.750
They had a nice granite
edifice.

01:12:08.750 --> 01:12:11.540
You'd go in and there'd be
a banker sitting there.

01:12:11.540 --> 01:12:13.500
And you could talk
to a person, and

01:12:13.500 --> 01:12:15.650
they'd make a loan.

01:12:15.650 --> 01:12:18.560
But now, we have all these
complicated derivative

01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:21.940
contracts, and they trade all
over the world and it's so

01:12:21.940 --> 01:12:23.190
interconnected.

01:12:25.880 --> 01:12:28.720
And shadow banking, which I'll
come back to later, shadow

01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:31.390
banking is a consequence of --

01:12:31.390 --> 01:12:34.260
it's the kind of thing
that happens.

01:12:34.260 --> 01:12:37.580
Regulators can't keep up with
all these innovations.

01:12:37.580 --> 01:12:40.120
But I don't think the answer is
to shut down innovations.

01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:44.390
We just have to allocate
resources, and that's a trend

01:12:44.390 --> 01:12:45.940
that we are doing.

01:12:45.940 --> 01:12:51.360
And I think that we will
benefit, if we have effective

01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:53.970
and sound regulation that
takes into account the

01:12:53.970 --> 01:12:57.970
subtleties of moral hazard,
adverse selection, importance

01:12:57.970 --> 01:12:58.500
of liquidity.

01:12:58.500 --> 01:13:02.490
These are basic, important
concepts that make for better

01:13:02.490 --> 01:13:04.270
lives for people.

01:13:04.270 --> 01:13:06.690
And we have to expect
that regulation is

01:13:06.690 --> 01:13:08.880
going to get complex.

01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:10.655
Basel III may look complex.

01:13:10.655 --> 01:13:12.620
It's going to get even more
complex, but we'll have

01:13:12.620 --> 01:13:17.130
computers managing the
regulations somewhat, so it'll

01:13:17.130 --> 01:13:18.410
all be doable.

01:13:18.410 --> 01:13:18.800
OK.

01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:19.800
I'll see you again.

01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:22.080
I hope you have a nice
spring vacation.

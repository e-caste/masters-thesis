00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:03.120
Prof: Well,
I'd really better start.

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.637
I can infer,
I think, from looking around

00:00:06.637 --> 00:00:12.002
the room that there is either
post-paper depression at work or

00:00:12.002 --> 00:00:17.980
that having written the paper,
you scarcely had time to read a

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.910
fifteen-page labyrinthine essay
by Lacan.

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.874
That's unfortunate,
and I hope you're able to make

00:00:25.874 --> 00:00:27.250
up for it soon.
 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:32.896
Those of you who are here today
can take such notes as you can

00:00:32.896 --> 00:00:38.728
figure out how to take and then
go back to the text of Lacan and

00:00:38.728 --> 00:00:41.320
try to make use of them.
 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.812
It is a pity that not
everyone's here,

00:00:44.812 --> 00:00:48.400
but we'll fare forward
nevertheless.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:53.483
Now there is an obvious link
between the work of Peter Brooks

00:00:53.483 --> 00:00:59.160
that you had last time and this
particular essay of Lacan which,

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.000
of course, I'd like to begin by
underlining.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.004
It has to do with the part of
the argument of Lacan which

00:01:06.004 --> 00:01:10.079
probably is most accessible to
you after your tour through

00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:13.084
structuralism and related
"-isms"

00:01:13.084 --> 00:01:16.573
and which,
in a way, I think really can be

00:01:16.573 --> 00:01:20.170
used to anchor a certain
understanding of Lacan.

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.712
It's something I am going to
want to spend a lot of time with

00:01:24.712 --> 00:01:26.530
in the long run today.
 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:31.442
In any case,
Brooks understood the fictional

00:01:31.442 --> 00:01:38.299
text and the completed fictional
narrative as a sustaining of

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:44.470
desire through a series of
détours,

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:51.360
detours, inadequate and
improper endpoints overcome,

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.650
resulting in a continuation of
desire,

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:00.170
resulting in a proper
ending--that is to say,

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.608
something corresponding to what
Freud understood as the desire

00:02:05.608 --> 00:02:11.045
of the organism to die in its
own way and not according to the

00:02:11.045 --> 00:02:15.949
modification or pressure of
something from without.

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:20.215
This sequence of
détour in the

00:02:20.215 --> 00:02:25.970
elaboration of a narrative plot
Brooks called metonymy,

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.480
in a way that by this time we
ought to recognize as what

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.156
happens in the putting together
of signs along the axis of

00:02:35.156 --> 00:02:38.930
combination as it's described by
Jakobson.

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.340
But Brooks remarks also that at
the same time,

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:48.470
there is a binding of
this sequence of signs--

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:55.111
of events in the case of a
plot--there is an effect of

00:02:55.111 --> 00:02:58.407
unity,
a feeling that the experience

00:02:58.407 --> 00:03:03.120
one has in reading a fictional
plot is an experience of unity.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.245
This effect he calls
"metaphor":

00:03:06.245 --> 00:03:09.447
that is to say,
our sense of the unity of a

00:03:09.447 --> 00:03:13.030
fictional plot we understand as
metaphoric.

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.889
Some kind of identity,
self-identity,

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:23.140
or close correspondence in the
meaning of the variety of events

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.715
that we have encountered results
in a unity that can be

00:03:27.715 --> 00:03:30.848
understood in metaphorical
terms.

00:03:30.848 --> 00:03:33.996
In other words,
something like what Jakobson

00:03:33.996 --> 00:03:36.629
calls the "poetic
function"

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:41.020
has been superimposed on the
metonymic axis of combination in

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:44.240
such a way that the feeling of
unity,

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:49.669
the sense of the recurrence of
identity in the signs used,

00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:52.240
is something that we can come
away with.

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:56.720
This, Brooks argues,
accounts for our sense of the

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:02.114
unity of the plot even as we
understand it to be a perpetual

00:04:02.114 --> 00:04:05.038
form of the delay of desire.
 

00:04:05.038 --> 00:04:08.788
I speak of the delay of desire:
That's most obvious,

00:04:08.788 --> 00:04:11.477
of course, in a marriage plot,
the marriage plot being the

00:04:11.477 --> 00:04:14.351
heart of fiction,
perhaps, and most immediately

00:04:14.351 --> 00:04:17.502
intelligible--
but of course desire takes many

00:04:17.502 --> 00:04:17.990
forms.
 

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:21.793
There are many sorts of plot,
and they always do in one form

00:04:21.793 --> 00:04:24.307
or another have to do,
in Brooks' sense,

00:04:24.307 --> 00:04:25.339
with desire.
 

00:04:25.339 --> 00:04:31.211
Now I pause in this way over
Brooks because I think you can

00:04:31.211 --> 00:04:33.740
see--
whatever frustration you may

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.339
also be feeling in encountering
Lacan--

00:04:36.339 --> 00:04:40.684
I think you can see that the
same basic movement is at work

00:04:40.684 --> 00:04:44.129
in Lacan's understanding of the
unconscious.

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:50.291
The discourse of desire for
Lacan, the perpetual deferral of

00:04:50.291 --> 00:04:55.831
bringing into consciousness,
into being, into presence,

00:04:55.831 --> 00:05:00.396
the object of desire--
Lacan, too, harkens back to

00:05:00.396 --> 00:05:05.814
Freud as Brooks does,
harkens back to the connection

00:05:05.814 --> 00:05:12.016
made in Freudian thought and
picked up by Jakobson between

00:05:12.016 --> 00:05:19.199
condensation in the dream work
and metaphor in the dream work,

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:22.502
and displacement in the dream
work and metonymy in the dream

00:05:22.502 --> 00:05:25.000
work--
this is central as well to

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.420
Lacan's argument.
 

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:30.867
The deferral of desire,
and for Lacan the impossibility

00:05:30.867 --> 00:05:35.069
of ever realizing one's desire
for a certain kind of

00:05:35.069 --> 00:05:38.942
"other"
that I'm going to be trying to

00:05:38.942 --> 00:05:42.980
identify during the course of
the lecture,

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:48.180
is understood as metonymy,
just as Brooks understands the

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:52.545
movement of metonymy as not a
perpetual but as a

00:05:52.545 --> 00:05:56.911
plot-sustaining
détour or deferral

00:05:56.911 --> 00:05:58.490
of the end.
 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:03.939
So this, too,
one finds in desire in Lacan.

00:06:03.939 --> 00:06:08.199
Metaphor, on the other hand,
he understands to be what he

00:06:08.199 --> 00:06:12.309
calls at one interesting point
"the quilting"

00:06:12.309 --> 00:06:17.240
of the metonymic chain,
the point de capiton or

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:22.562
"quilting button"
that suddenly holds together a

00:06:22.562 --> 00:06:28.165
sequence of disparate signifiers
in such a way that a kind of

00:06:28.165 --> 00:06:33.124
substitution of signs,
as opposed to a displacement of

00:06:33.124 --> 00:06:34.920
signs,
can be accomplished.

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:39.459
We'll come back to this later
on in attempting to understand

00:06:39.459 --> 00:06:44.459
what Lacan has to say about that
line from Victor Hugo's poem,

00:06:44.459 --> 00:06:47.610
"Boaz Asleep,"
the line: "His sheaves

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:49.959
were not miserly nor
spiteful."

00:06:49.959 --> 00:06:51.000
We'll come back to that.
 

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.822
In the meantime,
the point of Lacan and what

00:06:54.822 --> 00:07:00.069
makes Lacan's reading of desire
different from Brooks's,

00:07:00.069 --> 00:07:03.639
and indeed what makes his
reading of desire different from

00:07:03.639 --> 00:07:07.211
that of anyone who thinks of
these structuralist issues in

00:07:07.211 --> 00:07:12.014
psychoanalytic terms,
is that Lacan really doesn't

00:07:12.014 --> 00:07:17.230
believe that we can ever have
what we desire.

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:20.680
He has no doubt that we can
have what we need.

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:24.269
He makes the fundamental
distinction between having what

00:07:24.269 --> 00:07:26.620
we desire and having what we
need.

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:30.028
The distinction is often
put--and when you read Slavoj

00:07:30.028 --> 00:07:33.454
Å―iÅūek next week--
who makes a much more central

00:07:33.454 --> 00:07:35.423
point of this,
it's often put as the

00:07:35.423 --> 00:07:37.228
distinction between the
"big other"--

00:07:37.228 --> 00:07:38.209
&gt;
 

00:07:38.209 --> 00:07:42.779
and later on we'll talk about
why it's big--

00:07:42.779 --> 00:07:46.617
the "big other,"
which one can never appropriate

00:07:46.617 --> 00:07:50.524
as an object of desire because
it is perpetually and always

00:07:50.524 --> 00:07:53.230
elusive,
and the "objet petit

00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:56.500
ā,"
the little object of desire,

00:07:56.500 --> 00:08:00.348
which is not really an object
of desire at all but is

00:08:00.348 --> 00:08:02.420
available to satisfy need.
 

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:06.199
Sociobiologically,
you can get what you need.

00:08:06.199 --> 00:08:10.819
Psychoanalytically,
you cannot get what you desire.

00:08:10.819 --> 00:08:15.939
Now the obvious gloss here,
I think, is the Rolling Stones.

00:08:15.939 --> 00:08:20.238
If Lacan were the Rolling
Stones, he'd have slightly

00:08:20.238 --> 00:08:23.778
rewritten the famous refrain by
saying,

00:08:23.778 --> 00:08:27.430
"You can't ever 'git' what
you want,"

00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:31.160
right: "but sometimes if
you try"--

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:32.870
and you got to try.
 

00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:33.870
Even for what you need,
you got to--

00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:34.557
&gt;
 

00:08:34.557 --> 00:08:34.729
right?
 

00:08:34.729 --> 00:08:35.529
&gt;
 

00:08:35.529 --> 00:08:38.927
You can't just sit
there--"Sometimes if you

00:08:38.927 --> 00:08:41.529
try you 'git' what you
need."

00:08:41.529 --> 00:08:46.861
I'm sure that Mick Jagger had
many sticky fingers in the pages

00:08:46.861 --> 00:08:52.720
of Lacan in order to be able to
make that important distinction,

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:56.765
but I think it's one that
perhaps you might want to salt

00:08:56.765 --> 00:09:00.960
away the next time you feel
confused about the distinction

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:03.019
between desire and need.
 

00:09:03.019 --> 00:09:05.773
Now obviously,
it'd be great if we could just

00:09:05.773 --> 00:09:08.710
stop there,
but we do have to get a little

00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:12.692
closer to the text and try to
figure out why in these terms

00:09:12.692 --> 00:09:16.426
given to us by Lacan,
terms both structuralist and

00:09:16.426 --> 00:09:19.947
psychoanalytic--
we have to figure out why this

00:09:19.947 --> 00:09:23.470
distinction prevails and what it
amounts to,

00:09:23.470 --> 00:09:25.548
so we soldier on.
 

00:09:25.548 --> 00:09:28.649
First of all,
let me just say a couple of

00:09:28.649 --> 00:09:30.200
things in passing.
 

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:36.720
There is for humanistic studies
more than one Jacques Lacan.

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:39.788
There is the Lacan for literary
studies who,

00:09:39.788 --> 00:09:44.070
I think, is very well
represented by the text we have

00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:47.004
before us,
even though some of his most

00:09:47.004 --> 00:09:50.269
important ideas are only hinted
at in this text.

00:09:50.269 --> 00:09:53.149
For example,
we hear nothing in this text

00:09:53.149 --> 00:09:56.820
about his famous triadic
distinction among the real,

00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:59.340
the imaginary and the symbolic.
 

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:03.075
This is something we can't
really explore with only this

00:10:03.075 --> 00:10:04.230
text before us.
 

00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:06.735
There is only the slightest
hint at the very end of the

00:10:06.735 --> 00:10:09.379
essay on the last page of the
distinction I have just made

00:10:09.379 --> 00:10:11.235
between the "big
other" and the

00:10:11.235 --> 00:10:13.370
"objet petit
ā."

00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:15.832
We'll have lots of time to
think about that because it's

00:10:15.832 --> 00:10:18.610
central to the essay of Å―iÅūek
that you'll read next week,

00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:23.205
but for literary studies
focusing on the structuralist

00:10:23.205 --> 00:10:27.120
legacy for Lacan,
this is an exemplary selection.

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:31.090
But there's also the Lacan,
perhaps a more current Lacan--

00:10:31.090 --> 00:10:34.481
one better known,
perhaps, even to some of you in

00:10:34.481 --> 00:10:36.955
film studies:
the Lacan of "the

00:10:36.955 --> 00:10:40.418
gaze," the complicated
dialectic of "the

00:10:40.418 --> 00:10:44.235
gaze" which does very much
involve negotiating the

00:10:44.235 --> 00:10:48.610
distinctions among the real,
the imaginary and the symbolic.

00:10:48.610 --> 00:10:53.273
As I say, this Lacan we're
obliged largely to leave aside

00:10:53.273 --> 00:10:57.604
if only because of the
selectivity of what I've given

00:10:57.604 --> 00:11:02.105
you to read,
but as I say these are Lacans

00:11:02.105 --> 00:11:08.275
with quite different emphases
overlapping only to a certain

00:11:08.275 --> 00:11:09.340
degree.
 

00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:13.490
Now the other thing I want to
say in passing explains some of

00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:16.259
the rather strange tone of this
essay.

00:11:16.259 --> 00:11:19.990
You notice that Lacan is just
sort of bristling with hostility

00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:21.460
&gt;
 

00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:24.690
and, of course,
as well, condescension.

00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:27.989
Of all the big egos in our
syllabus, this is by far the

00:11:27.989 --> 00:11:28.600
biggest.
 

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:32.287
It's just something we have to
live with and come to terms

00:11:32.287 --> 00:11:35.909
with, but the condescension
isn't just toward the natural

00:11:35.909 --> 00:11:38.240
stupidity of all the rest of us.
 

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:40.139
It's toward,
in particular,

00:11:40.139 --> 00:11:43.796
what he takes to be the
distortion of the legacy of

00:11:43.796 --> 00:11:47.889
Freud by most of his
psychoanalytic contemporaries,

00:11:47.889 --> 00:11:52.470
particularly the International
Psychoanalytic Association,

00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:56.113
many members of whom were the
so-called American "ego

00:11:56.113 --> 00:11:57.519
psychologists."
 

00:11:57.519 --> 00:11:59.220
Now what is an ego psychologist?
 

00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:02.330
It's somebody who begins as
Lacan does--

00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:04.820
and this is something we'll
want to come back to--

00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:08.690
somebody who begins with
Freud's famous proposition,

00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:14.250
"Wo es war soll ich
sein": "Where it was,

00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:17.629
there I should be."
 

00:12:17.629 --> 00:12:21.477
In other words,
out of the raw materials of the

00:12:21.477 --> 00:12:24.217
id--
it, es--in the

00:12:24.217 --> 00:12:27.916
unconscious, the ego--
that is to say,

00:12:27.916 --> 00:12:32.318
the capacity of the human
organism to develop into its

00:12:32.318 --> 00:12:35.928
maturity--
should arise.

00:12:35.928 --> 00:12:39.583
In other words,
the relationship between

00:12:39.583 --> 00:12:44.832
instinctual drives and the
proper inhibitions of human or

00:12:44.832 --> 00:12:49.798
adult consciousness should be a
progressive one,

00:12:49.798 --> 00:12:52.205
and the purpose of
psychoanalysis,

00:12:52.205 --> 00:12:56.580
the purpose of bringing people
beyond their entrapment in the

00:12:56.580 --> 00:13:00.807
various infantile stages or
beyond their entrapment in some

00:13:00.807 --> 00:13:05.216
form or another of neurosis,
the idea of progress or

00:13:05.216 --> 00:13:10.024
development in psychoanalysis--
it has to do with the emergence

00:13:10.024 --> 00:13:12.178
and reinforcement of the ego.
 

00:13:12.178 --> 00:13:16.494
Lacan hates this idea,
and the reason he hates it is

00:13:16.494 --> 00:13:21.231
because that idea of the
emergence of a stable and mature

00:13:21.231 --> 00:13:26.224
ego is presupposed by the idea
that there is such a thing as

00:13:26.224 --> 00:13:30.370
stable human subjectivity:
in other words,

00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:35.028
that there is such a thing as
consciousness from which our

00:13:35.028 --> 00:13:40.340
communicative and linguistic and
other sorts of systems derive.

00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:44.230
Lacan takes a completely
different view of consciousness.

00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:47.317
This, of course,
is something to which we will

00:13:47.317 --> 00:13:51.486
turn in a moment,
but the basic disagreement and

00:13:51.486 --> 00:13:57.174
the source of his most intense
hostility throughout this essay

00:13:57.174 --> 00:14:02.864
concerns the question whether or
not there is for each of us a

00:14:02.864 --> 00:14:07.620
stable and by implication unique
subjectivity.

00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:09.158
We are not each other.
 

00:14:09.158 --> 00:14:13.616
We suppose ourselves--indeed,
we complain when we think about

00:14:13.616 --> 00:14:16.780
ethics,
about our isolation from each

00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:18.302
other--
we suppose ourselves to be

00:14:18.302 --> 00:14:19.418
altogether
&gt;

00:14:19.418 --> 00:14:23.976
individual whereas for Lacan,
there is a kind of

00:14:23.976 --> 00:14:29.504
continuousness in consciousness,
the reason for which I'll

00:14:29.504 --> 00:14:32.899
explain, which is not absolute.
 

00:14:32.899 --> 00:14:36.450
In the long run,
in this essay you will find--

00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:39.630
and I hope to be able to
understand this as a kind of

00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:44.783
turn in his argument--
you will find that Lacan does

00:14:44.783 --> 00:14:50.629
actually hold out a limited
sense of individual

00:14:50.629 --> 00:14:54.863
subjectivity,
not really as autonomous

00:14:54.863 --> 00:14:58.813
subjectivity,
not something that can

00:14:58.813 --> 00:15:05.090
authorize a sense of free will
or power of agency,

00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:10.976
but a way in which,
owing simply to the complexity

00:15:10.976 --> 00:15:15.706
of the unconscious,
each of us, as it were,

00:15:15.706 --> 00:15:20.700
inhabits a slightly different
form of that complexity.

00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:25.120
Lacan goes that far in the
direction of the subject,

00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:30.092
or of subjectivity,
but refuses the idea that the

00:15:30.092 --> 00:15:36.000
subject is something that can
emerge from analysis or--

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.048
in the case of,
I suppose, most of us--

00:15:38.048 --> 00:15:41.519
simply through maturation as a
stable,

00:15:41.519 --> 00:15:49.149
coherent, well-organized sense
of self and identity.

00:15:49.149 --> 00:15:50.629
All right.
 

00:15:50.629 --> 00:15:54.236
Let's start,
then, with the one piece of

00:15:54.236 --> 00:15:58.769
really solid clinical work that
Lacan ever did.

00:15:58.769 --> 00:16:01.711
Lacan's psychoanalytic
philosophy is,

00:16:01.711 --> 00:16:05.717
as he would be the first to
admit and even sort of

00:16:05.717 --> 00:16:09.558
cheerfully to endorse,
largely speculative.

00:16:09.558 --> 00:16:12.285
That is to say,
he works in depth with

00:16:12.285 --> 00:16:15.158
philosophical and literary
materials.

00:16:15.158 --> 00:16:19.918
He is not glued to the
analyst's chair.

00:16:19.918 --> 00:16:26.902
He is notoriously impatient
with his analysands and is very

00:16:26.902 --> 00:16:32.558
interested in matters of
analysis either in,

00:16:32.558 --> 00:16:34.525
on the one hand,
shortcuts or,

00:16:34.525 --> 00:16:37.908
on the other hand--
championing Freud's late essay,

00:16:37.908 --> 00:16:41.070
"Analysis Terminable or
Interminable"--

00:16:41.070 --> 00:16:44.389
taking the side that analysis
is, just obviously,

00:16:44.389 --> 00:16:46.179
such is the complexity of the
thing,

00:16:46.179 --> 00:16:47.320
interminable.
 

00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:53.188
But the one really solid piece
of clinical research that Lacan

00:16:53.188 --> 00:16:59.058
did and that is accepted as part
of the psychoanalytic lore is

00:16:59.058 --> 00:17:04.640
the work that he did in the
1930s on the mirror stage.

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:10.382
That work actually does
generate the system of ideas

00:17:10.382 --> 00:17:13.309
that Lacan has to offer.
 

00:17:13.309 --> 00:17:15.318
So what is the mirror stage?
 

00:17:15.318 --> 00:17:19.970
A baby in the anal phase--that
is to say,

00:17:19.970 --> 00:17:23.390
no longer identifying with the
breast of the mother,

00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:27.871
but aware of a sense of
difference between whatever it

00:17:27.871 --> 00:17:32.098
might be and that otherness
which is out there--

00:17:32.098 --> 00:17:35.980
a baby views itself in the
mirror, and maybe it views

00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:39.863
itself like this [turns towards
board with hands up].

00:17:39.863 --> 00:17:40.609
Right?
 

00:17:40.609 --> 00:17:42.380
It can only crawl.
 

00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:44.190
It can barely touch its nose.
 

00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:47.713
It can't feed itself,
and the actual nature of its

00:17:47.713 --> 00:17:50.880
body is still fragmented and
disorganized.

00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:52.298
It lacks coordination.
 

00:17:52.298 --> 00:17:56.539
In fact, it lacks,
in any ordinary sense of the

00:17:56.539 --> 00:17:59.490
term, "uprightness."
 

00:17:59.490 --> 00:18:02.102
But let's say it's looking at
itself in the mirror like this

00:18:02.102 --> 00:18:03.828
[turns towards board with hands
up],

00:18:03.828 --> 00:18:05.727
and so what it sees is
something like this [gestures

00:18:05.727 --> 00:18:06.769
towards diagram on board].
 

00:18:06.769 --> 00:18:10.811
In other words,
it sees something which is

00:18:10.811 --> 00:18:15.940
coherent, coordinated,
and really rather handsome.

00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:17.691
"Oh,"
&gt;

00:18:17.691 --> 00:18:19.207
it says, "Wow,
you know, I'm

00:18:19.207 --> 00:18:20.248
&gt;
 

00:18:20.248 --> 00:18:20.769
okay."
 

00:18:20.769 --> 00:18:22.190
&gt;
 

00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:25.936
It acknowledges itself to be,
it recognizes itself to

00:18:25.936 --> 00:18:29.180
be--it's the object of the
mother's desire.

00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:29.880
Right?
 

00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:34.048
That is the moment in which it
no longer identifies with the

00:18:34.048 --> 00:18:38.077
breast but thinks of itself as
the object of the desire of

00:18:38.077 --> 00:18:41.470
another because it's so pleased
with itself.

00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:43.700
"Somebody's got to desire
me.

00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:45.048
It's probably Mom."
 

00:18:45.048 --> 00:18:47.933
So &gt;
 

00:18:47.933 --> 00:18:52.663
there it is,
and this is the moment of the

00:18:52.663 --> 00:18:54.509
mirror stage.
 

00:18:54.509 --> 00:18:57.670
Now what happens after
that--and by the way,

00:18:57.670 --> 00:19:00.993
the rather wonderful epigraph
from Leonardo da Vinci which

00:19:00.993 --> 00:19:03.269
begins your essay is all about
this--

00:19:03.269 --> 00:19:07.538
what happens after that is
rather tragic.

00:19:07.538 --> 00:19:12.308
The baby falls into
language,

00:19:12.308 --> 00:19:15.588
and in the moment--and I'm
going to come back in a minute

00:19:15.588 --> 00:19:19.220
to the whole question of why it
is language that does this--

00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:22.858
in the moment at which it falls
into language,

00:19:22.858 --> 00:19:29.568
it no longer sees itself as the
ideal I--

00:19:29.568 --> 00:19:33.359
"das
Ideal-Ich"

00:19:33.359 --> 00:19:36.048
in Freud's language.
 

00:19:36.048 --> 00:19:40.872
It comes into the recognition
that it doesn't even have its

00:19:40.872 --> 00:19:43.700
own name, let alone an identity.
 

00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:46.661
It has "the name of the
father,"

00:19:46.661 --> 00:19:50.200
but it doesn't have the phallus
of the father,

00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:55.269
and it begins to recognize
competition in desire.

00:19:55.269 --> 00:20:01.265
It begins to recognize that
what it itself desires is not

00:20:01.265 --> 00:20:07.046
accessible in a kind of
mutuality of desire and that it

00:20:07.046 --> 00:20:12.868
has no choice but to admire--
while at the same time envying

00:20:12.868 --> 00:20:17.675
and indeed forming as an object
of desire because that's what it

00:20:17.675 --> 00:20:19.630
lacks--
the father.

00:20:19.630 --> 00:20:23.797
That's the sense in which--but
it's the father only in a

00:20:23.797 --> 00:20:25.538
phantasmagoric sense.
 

00:20:25.538 --> 00:20:31.587
In Lacan the object of desire
can be just absolutely

00:20:31.587 --> 00:20:39.059
anything depending on the
course of the unraveling of the

00:20:39.059 --> 00:20:44.160
metonymic sequence that desire
follows;

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:47.915
but this is what Lacan
associates with the Oedipal

00:20:47.915 --> 00:20:49.383
phase;
that's why I say,

00:20:49.383 --> 00:20:51.190
in passing, "the
father."

00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:57.173
It does have something to do
with Lacan's revision of Freud

00:20:57.173 --> 00:21:03.260
in saying that the object of
lack that perpetually motivates

00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:07.365
desire,
the desire for what one lacks,

00:21:07.365 --> 00:21:09.660
is not at all physical.
 

00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:14.555
If you make that mistake,
you're right back in sort of

00:21:14.555 --> 00:21:16.680
mindless Freudianism.
 

00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:18.220
You know, it's not the
penis!

00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:21.886
It is, on the contrary,
something which is by nature

00:21:21.886 --> 00:21:27.058
symbolic,
something which is an ego ideal

00:21:27.058 --> 00:21:32.317
but no longer oneself--
that is to say,

00:21:32.317 --> 00:21:34.910
no longer what one has
but what,

00:21:34.910 --> 00:21:37.568
through the gap opened up by
language,

00:21:37.568 --> 00:21:40.160
one recognizes that one
lacks.

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:44.396
So it takes a variety of,
let's just say,

00:21:44.396 --> 00:21:46.940
phallogocentric forms.
 

00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:50.710
In film criticism,
some of you may know the essay,

00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:54.992
the Lacanian essay of Laura
Mulvey in which the female

00:21:54.992 --> 00:21:58.548
object of the spectator's desire
or gaze,

00:21:58.548 --> 00:22:04.269
dressed in a sheath dress,
is actually just like the baby,

00:22:04.269 --> 00:22:05.740
just like anything else that's
upright,

00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:07.500
it is this [points to
the vertical axis on the board].

00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:10.759
In other words,
it is, despite being obviously

00:22:10.759 --> 00:22:14.670
an incredibly different kind of
thing, nevertheless.

00:22:14.670 --> 00:22:18.019
in symbolic terms, the phallus.
 

00:22:18.019 --> 00:22:18.558
All right.
 

00:22:18.558 --> 00:22:23.325
Now the question then is:
why is it that it's

00:22:23.325 --> 00:22:26.900
language that does this?
 

00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:31.805
Lacan speaks of the
impossibility of realizing an

00:22:31.805 --> 00:22:36.097
object of desire,
because the metonymic structure

00:22:36.097 --> 00:22:39.724
of desire follows what he calls
"an asymptotic

00:22:39.724 --> 00:22:42.263
course,"
"asymptotic"

00:22:42.263 --> 00:22:46.688
meaning the line which curves
toward the line it wants to meet

00:22:46.688 --> 00:22:48.720
but never reaches it.
 

00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:53.559
There's a kind of an underlying
punning sense in that word of

00:22:53.559 --> 00:22:58.318
the metonymic course of desire
not revealing the symptom.

00:22:58.318 --> 00:23:01.759
It's asymptotic in that sense
as well.

00:23:01.759 --> 00:23:05.871
The only thing that can reveal
the symptom is those moments of

00:23:05.871 --> 00:23:09.374
quilting,
the moments at the point de

00:23:09.374 --> 00:23:13.416
capiton when metaphor,
as Lacan says on two different

00:23:13.416 --> 00:23:16.990
occasions in the essay,
reveals the symptom.

00:23:16.990 --> 00:23:21.849
So this is what happens when
you can't "git"

00:23:21.849 --> 00:23:25.519
ever--when you can't ever
"git"

00:23:25.519 --> 00:23:27.170
what you want.
 

00:23:27.170 --> 00:23:29.980
But don't worry,
because you can always have

00:23:29.980 --> 00:23:32.269
what you need as long as you
try.

00:23:32.269 --> 00:23:37.078
So the question is:
why does language do this?

00:23:37.078 --> 00:23:43.459
What is it about language that
introduces this problematic

00:23:43.459 --> 00:23:45.250
beyond repair?
 

00:23:45.250 --> 00:23:51.195
Lacan begins the essay with a
claim about the Freudian

00:23:51.195 --> 00:23:54.336
unconscious,
a claim which he takes,

00:23:54.336 --> 00:23:57.375
he says, from The
Interpretation of Dreams

00:23:57.375 --> 00:24:00.223
where Freud speaks of the
relationship between

00:24:00.223 --> 00:24:03.578
condensation and displacement in
the dream work.

00:24:03.578 --> 00:24:07.750
Lacan says, "The
unconscious is structured like a

00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:09.088
language."
 

00:24:09.088 --> 00:24:13.489
That's perhaps the single
expression that people take away

00:24:13.489 --> 00:24:15.492
from Lacan,
and rightly so,

00:24:15.492 --> 00:24:16.910
because it is,
again,

00:24:16.910 --> 00:24:21.601
foundational for what we need
to understand if we're to get

00:24:21.601 --> 00:24:24.756
along with him:
"the unconscious is

00:24:24.756 --> 00:24:27.750
structured like a
language."

00:24:27.750 --> 00:24:28.990
Now what does this mean?
 

00:24:28.990 --> 00:24:32.155
He doesn't say,
"The unconscious is

00:24:32.155 --> 00:24:34.358
a language,"
by the way,

00:24:34.358 --> 00:24:37.290
and he doesn't say that he
means the unconscious is

00:24:37.290 --> 00:24:39.930
structured exclusively like
human language.

00:24:39.930 --> 00:24:43.851
He means that the unconscious
is structured like a semiotic

00:24:43.851 --> 00:24:44.460
system.
 

00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:48.000
In fact, he draws from Freud's
Interpretation of Dreams

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.538
the idea that the way the
dream work works and the way

00:24:51.538 --> 00:24:54.115
everyday life,
in Freud's sense of the

00:24:54.115 --> 00:24:56.240
psychopathology of everyday
life,

00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:59.858
works is like a
rebus--in other words,

00:24:59.858 --> 00:25:04.018
one of those puzzles in which
you can find an underlying

00:25:04.018 --> 00:25:08.480
sentence if you figure out how
to put together drawings,

00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:12.220
numbers, and syllables:
in other words,

00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:17.231
a sequence of signs taken from
different semiotic systems that

00:25:17.231 --> 00:25:20.930
can put themselves together into
a meaning.

00:25:20.930 --> 00:25:26.308
That's how Lacan understands
the dream work and the movements

00:25:26.308 --> 00:25:28.910
of consciousness to unfold.
 

00:25:28.910 --> 00:25:32.663
The unconscious then is
structured like a language,

00:25:32.663 --> 00:25:37.470
which is not the same thing as
to say it is a language.

00:25:37.470 --> 00:25:38.960
Okay.
 

00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:40.338
Structured like a language.
 

00:25:40.338 --> 00:25:44.702
This means--and this is where
there is this enormous gulf

00:25:44.702 --> 00:25:48.131
between Lacan and most other
practitioners of

00:25:48.131 --> 00:25:51.384
psychoanalysis--
the unconscious is not,

00:25:51.384 --> 00:25:54.935
in that case,
to be understood as the seat of

00:25:54.935 --> 00:25:56.118
the instincts.
 

00:25:56.118 --> 00:25:59.759
It's not to be understood as
something prior,

00:25:59.759 --> 00:26:03.089
in other words,
to those forms of derivative

00:26:03.089 --> 00:26:06.020
articulation,
those forms of articulation

00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:09.404
emerging through maturity that
we're accustomed to call

00:26:09.404 --> 00:26:10.910
"language."
 

00:26:10.910 --> 00:26:14.690
If the unconscious is
structured like a language,

00:26:14.690 --> 00:26:21.268
then it--the id,
es--itself is precisely

00:26:21.268 --> 00:26:27.436
the signifier,
the signifier that emerges as

00:26:27.436 --> 00:26:34.140
language: not that it is
foundational to language,

00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:37.297
because Lacan's point,
like the point of many other

00:26:37.297 --> 00:26:42.824
people in our syllabus,
is not that language expresses

00:26:42.824 --> 00:26:43.990
thought.
 

00:26:43.990 --> 00:26:46.990
It's not at all that language
expresses thought,

00:26:46.990 --> 00:26:50.558
but that language constitutes
thought,

00:26:50.558 --> 00:26:54.019
that language brings thought,
consciousness,

00:26:54.019 --> 00:26:57.999
or a sense of things into
being, and that this is

00:26:57.999 --> 00:27:00.568
articulated through language.
 

00:27:00.568 --> 00:27:03.670
Now this, of course,
brings us immediately to

00:27:03.670 --> 00:27:07.897
certain issues of conflict that
Lacan has not just with other

00:27:07.897 --> 00:27:12.759
forms of psychoanalysis but with
a whole philosophical tradition.

00:27:12.759 --> 00:27:15.769
If you are a materialist--in
other words,

00:27:15.769 --> 00:27:20.436
if you believe that things come
first and consciousness comes

00:27:20.436 --> 00:27:24.558
second: that is to say,
if you're a Marxist,

00:27:24.558 --> 00:27:28.338
if you believe that
consciousness,

00:27:28.338 --> 00:27:30.740
ideology, or call it what you
will,

00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:34.880
is determined by existing
material circumstances--

00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:38.388
as one says--you can't very
well think that existing

00:27:38.388 --> 00:27:41.829
material circumstances are
produced by language.

00:27:41.829 --> 00:27:42.578
Whoa.
 

00:27:42.578 --> 00:27:45.490
If by the same token you're a
positivist,

00:27:45.490 --> 00:27:50.532
if you believe that the meaning
of things is something that is

00:27:50.532 --> 00:27:54.519
expressed by language,
something that language is

00:27:54.519 --> 00:27:58.509
brought into being to express:
then also you are giving

00:27:58.509 --> 00:28:01.545
priority to things,
to that which is behind

00:28:01.545 --> 00:28:04.390
language, to that which gives
rise to language--

00:28:04.390 --> 00:28:06.316
rather than,
as Lacan does,

00:28:06.316 --> 00:28:08.538
giving priority to language.
 

00:28:08.538 --> 00:28:12.605
He actually attacks both the
Marxist tradition and the

00:28:12.605 --> 00:28:16.750
positivist tradition at various
points in your text.

00:28:16.750 --> 00:28:21.971
The sideways blow at Marxism is
on page 1130,

00:28:21.971 --> 00:28:24.818
the right-hand column.
 

00:28:24.818 --> 00:28:29.048
The sideways blow at positivism
is on page 1132,

00:28:29.048 --> 00:28:31.210
the right-hand column.
 

00:28:31.210 --> 00:28:37.108
I don't want to pause to quote
them but you can go to them in

00:28:37.108 --> 00:28:38.288
your text.
 

00:28:38.288 --> 00:28:42.328
So what is it,
id, or es?

00:28:42.328 --> 00:28:49.068
What is that which is normally
called "the instinctual

00:28:49.068 --> 00:28:54.182
drives,"
the id, the unmediated wish for

00:28:54.182 --> 00:28:55.808
something?
 

00:28:55.808 --> 00:29:00.368
Well, Lacan says it is nothing
other than the signifier.

00:29:00.368 --> 00:29:04.170
He says, "What do I mean
by literalism?

00:29:04.170 --> 00:29:08.329
How else can I mean it except
literally?

00:29:08.329 --> 00:29:10.068
It is the letter."
 

00:29:10.068 --> 00:29:13.980
That is to say,
consciousness begins with the

00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:14.778
letter.
 

00:29:14.778 --> 00:29:20.285
Remember Levi-Strauss saying in
the text quoted by Derrida that

00:29:20.285 --> 00:29:25.880
language doesn't come into being
just a little bit at a time.

00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:29.060
One day there is no language,
and the next day there is

00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:32.786
language: which is to say,
suddenly there is a way of

00:29:32.786 --> 00:29:36.936
conferring meaning on things,
and that way of conferring

00:29:36.936 --> 00:29:39.288
meaning on things is
differential.

00:29:39.288 --> 00:29:42.127
That is to say,
it introduces the arbitrary

00:29:42.127 --> 00:29:45.778
nature of the sign and the
differential relations among

00:29:45.778 --> 00:29:49.359
signs which are featured in the
work of Saussure.

00:29:49.359 --> 00:29:52.048
So it is for Lacan.
 

00:29:52.048 --> 00:29:58.890
The letter is not that which is
brought into being to express

00:29:58.890 --> 00:30:02.551
things,
not that which is brought into

00:30:02.551 --> 00:30:07.681
being in the service of the ego
to discipline and civilize the

00:30:07.681 --> 00:30:10.727
id,
but rather is "it"

00:30:10.727 --> 00:30:11.430
itself.
 

00:30:11.430 --> 00:30:13.490
That is to say,
it is the beginning.

00:30:13.490 --> 00:30:15.390
"In the beginning was the
word."

00:30:15.390 --> 00:30:19.394
In the beginning was the
letter, which disseminates

00:30:19.394 --> 00:30:23.877
consciousness through the
signifying system that it makes

00:30:23.877 --> 00:30:25.000
available.
 

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:29.650
Now actually I'm hoping that in
saying these things you find me

00:30:29.650 --> 00:30:32.950
merely and rather dully
repeating myself,

00:30:32.950 --> 00:30:35.338
saying things that I've said
before,

00:30:35.338 --> 00:30:39.287
because it seems to me that
this is the part of Lacan which

00:30:39.287 --> 00:30:43.097
is accessible and which is
central to the sorts of things

00:30:43.097 --> 00:30:47.377
that we've been talking about,
which I rather imagine you must

00:30:47.377 --> 00:30:49.400
be getting used to by this time.
 

00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:55.503
Lacan shares a structuralist
understanding of how the

00:30:55.503 --> 00:30:58.440
unconscious discourses.
 

00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:02.354
He accepts Jakobson's
distinction between metaphor and

00:31:02.354 --> 00:31:05.825
metonymy and he sees the
cooperative building-up

00:31:05.825 --> 00:31:10.256
relationship of metaphor and
metonymy in the discourse of the

00:31:10.256 --> 00:31:14.243
unconscious and of the
psychopathology of everyday life

00:31:14.243 --> 00:31:17.788
in much the same way that
Jakobson does.

00:31:17.788 --> 00:31:21.904
Remember Jakobson associates
metaphor and metonymy not just

00:31:21.904 --> 00:31:25.535
with poetry and prose,
not just with certain kinds of

00:31:25.535 --> 00:31:28.098
style,
but actually with pathologies.

00:31:28.098 --> 00:31:32.421
In its extreme forms,
metaphor and metonymy as

00:31:32.421 --> 00:31:37.894
manifest in linguistic practice
take the form of aphasias,

00:31:37.894 --> 00:31:41.300
as Lacan points out;
and so Jakobson,

00:31:41.300 --> 00:31:44.880
too, is concerned with
something sort of built-in,

00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:50.039
hard-wired in the way in which
language works in and as the

00:31:50.039 --> 00:31:53.537
unconscious that,
in its extreme forms,

00:31:53.537 --> 00:31:58.280
is aphasic and always expresses
itself in tendencies either

00:31:58.280 --> 00:32:00.490
metonymic or metaphoric.
 

00:32:00.490 --> 00:32:04.868
Now, of course,
he also draws on Saussure but--

00:32:04.868 --> 00:32:07.690
as your editor rightly points
out in a footnote--

00:32:07.690 --> 00:32:14.578
the way in which he reads
Saussure [draws on chalkboard],

00:32:14.578 --> 00:32:18.102
the signifier,
the big signifier over

00:32:18.102 --> 00:32:20.288
the little,
rather insignificant

00:32:20.288 --> 00:32:23.390
signified--because after all,
what does the signified matter?

00:32:23.390 --> 00:32:28.759
You can never cross the
bar--right?--to get to it.

00:32:28.759 --> 00:32:30.140
You are barred from it.
 

00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:35.390
The signified is that from
which you are forever excluded,

00:32:35.390 --> 00:32:40.640
and we'll go into Lacan's
examples of this in a minute.

00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:45.210
This is actually quite
different from Saussure's [draws

00:32:45.210 --> 00:32:48.426
on chalkboard]
"signified over the

00:32:48.426 --> 00:32:52.404
signifier,"
anchored by a kind of mutuality

00:32:52.404 --> 00:32:57.230
whereby it's never a question
what generates what,

00:32:57.230 --> 00:33:02.558
but rather a question which has
in common,

00:33:02.558 --> 00:33:07.063
I think, with Lacan's so-called
algorithm only in fact

00:33:07.063 --> 00:33:10.102
the bar itself;
the fact that the relationship

00:33:10.102 --> 00:33:14.262
between signifier and signified,
or signified and signifier,

00:33:14.262 --> 00:33:19.069
is an arbitrary one that can't
be crossed by evoking anything

00:33:19.069 --> 00:33:23.718
natural in the nature of the
signified that calls forth the

00:33:23.718 --> 00:33:24.920
signifier.
 

00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:28.848
There they agree,
but as to what produces what:

00:33:28.848 --> 00:33:33.887
Saussure is agnostic about it
and Lacan insists that the big

00:33:33.887 --> 00:33:38.328
S is that which generates
the signified--

00:33:38.328 --> 00:33:43.844
that from which any possibility
of grasping a signified arises

00:33:43.844 --> 00:33:45.108
and derives.
 

00:33:45.108 --> 00:33:51.028
So Lacan's algorithm is,
in fact, rather different from

00:33:51.028 --> 00:33:53.329
Saussure's diagram.
 

00:33:53.329 --> 00:33:54.740
Okay.
 

00:33:54.740 --> 00:33:57.284
Let's exemplify this by going
back to what I said about the

00:33:57.284 --> 00:33:59.827
red light [gestures to the board
repeatedly throughout this

00:33:59.827 --> 00:34:01.597
paragraph]--
right?--because here,

00:34:01.597 --> 00:34:03.430
too, I think we'll have
continuity.

00:34:03.430 --> 00:34:09.302
The red light over a door is a
signifier which has a great deal

00:34:09.302 --> 00:34:11.860
to do with desire,
right?

00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:14.340
This we take for granted.
 

00:34:14.340 --> 00:34:17.659
The red light in other contexts
has nothing to do with desire,

00:34:17.659 --> 00:34:20.994
but the signifier,
"red light over a

00:34:20.994 --> 00:34:25.518
door," suggests desire--
but desire for what?

00:34:25.518 --> 00:34:28.398
Well, we think we know
"desire for what,"

00:34:28.398 --> 00:34:30.010
but look at the signifier.
 

00:34:30.010 --> 00:34:32.969
"Desire for the
door," right?

00:34:32.969 --> 00:34:37.065
What is the relationship
between the signifier and what

00:34:37.065 --> 00:34:39.570
would seem to be the signified?
 

00:34:39.570 --> 00:34:41.949
That's not what you desire.
 

00:34:41.949 --> 00:34:44.628
You don't desire the door,
and it's the same with

00:34:44.628 --> 00:34:46.469
hommes et femmes,
right?

00:34:46.469 --> 00:34:49.289
What is this hommes et
femmes?

00:34:49.289 --> 00:34:50.090
Well, okay.
 

00:34:50.090 --> 00:34:52.411
The little girl says,
"We've arrived at

00:34:52.411 --> 00:34:54.789
Gentlemen,"
and the little boy says,

00:34:54.789 --> 00:34:56.280
"We've arrived at
Ladies."

00:34:56.280 --> 00:34:58.010
Well, that seems to be quite
healthy, right?

00:34:58.010 --> 00:35:02.568
We're on our way to something
like hetero-normative

00:35:02.568 --> 00:35:04.940
desire--great,
terrific.

00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:06.010
But wait a minute.
 

00:35:06.010 --> 00:35:09.610
This hommes here:
what is hommes?

00:35:09.610 --> 00:35:13.373
What does that have to do with
the price of--the only thing you

00:35:13.373 --> 00:35:17.260
can do even behind this door is
restore your personal comfort.

00:35:17.260 --> 00:35:19.960
It has nothing to do with
hommes,

00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:22.869
right, or anything else for
that matter.

00:35:22.869 --> 00:35:27.476
If the visible signified is in
question, well,

00:35:27.476 --> 00:35:32.800
in what sense can we call this
door hommes?

00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:33.500
Right?
 

00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:35.789
It's the same with
femmes.

00:35:35.789 --> 00:35:39.967
There is, in any case,
in Lacan's anecdote the

00:35:39.967 --> 00:35:44.239
wonderful existence of the
railroad tracks,

00:35:44.239 --> 00:35:47.050
which for him constitutes the
bar: that is to say,

00:35:47.050 --> 00:35:49.920
that owing to the nature of
language,

00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:54.166
owing to the arbitrary relation
of the signifier to the

00:35:54.166 --> 00:35:56.670
signified,
the little boy and little

00:35:56.670 --> 00:35:59.398
girl--who are wonderful
characters right out of

00:35:59.398 --> 00:36:03.092
Nabokov's Ada--
I don't know if any of you know

00:36:03.092 --> 00:36:05.715
that novel,
but the little boy is sort of a

00:36:05.715 --> 00:36:07.454
little genius,
obviously Lacan,

00:36:07.454 --> 00:36:09.780
but his sister is even smarter
than he is.

00:36:09.780 --> 00:36:12.911
"Idiot," she says,
just like a character in

00:36:12.911 --> 00:36:17.512
Nabokov, but both this little
boy and little girl are barred

00:36:17.512 --> 00:36:21.500
from desire--
from their desire--because they

00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:26.804
are already putting up with a
substitute precisely insofar as

00:36:26.804 --> 00:36:31.137
they seem to be on track toward
something like the

00:36:31.137 --> 00:36:34.940
hetero-normative expression of
desire.

00:36:34.940 --> 00:36:37.039
It's not an expression of
desire at all.

00:36:37.039 --> 00:36:40.315
It's an expression of need
because they are not able to

00:36:40.315 --> 00:36:42.862
bring into being,
consciousness,

00:36:42.862 --> 00:36:48.291
or before themselves the object
of desire indicated by the

00:36:48.291 --> 00:36:49.530
signifier.
 

00:36:49.530 --> 00:36:54.393
The signifier is always
displaced from the object of

00:36:54.393 --> 00:36:58.780
desire in precisely the ways
that are borne out

00:36:58.780 --> 00:37:02.500
diagrammatically in these
formulas.

00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:03.619
All right.
 

00:37:03.619 --> 00:37:08.030
So what then is desire?
 

00:37:08.030 --> 00:37:13.320
Well, perhaps we've covered it:
it is the endless deferral of

00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:18.436
that which cannot be signified
in the metonymic movement of

00:37:18.436 --> 00:37:20.898
discourse,
of dreaming,

00:37:20.898 --> 00:37:25.639
or of the way in which the
unconscious functions.

00:37:25.639 --> 00:37:29.710
Lacan is very ingenious in,
I think,

00:37:29.710 --> 00:37:32.639
convincingly showing us how it
is that we get from one

00:37:32.639 --> 00:37:34.849
signifier to another:
in other words,

00:37:34.849 --> 00:37:38.289
how what he calls the chain of
the signifier works.

00:37:38.289 --> 00:37:41.489
You have a series of concentric
rings [gestures to the board],

00:37:41.489 --> 00:37:45.780
but each concentric ring is
made up of a lot of little

00:37:45.780 --> 00:37:50.235
concentric rings which hook on
to associated surrounding

00:37:50.235 --> 00:37:53.960
signifiers in ways that could be
variable.

00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:57.099
This, I think,
very nicely re-diagrams

00:37:57.099 --> 00:38:01.429
Saussure's sense of the
associative structure of the

00:38:01.429 --> 00:38:04.400
vertical axis:
that is to say,

00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:07.429
of the synchronic moment of
language,

00:38:07.429 --> 00:38:10.938
the way in which some
signifiers naturally cluster

00:38:10.938 --> 00:38:14.391
with other signifiers,
and not just with one group of

00:38:14.391 --> 00:38:17.159
signifiers but a variety of
groups of signifiers.

00:38:17.159 --> 00:38:21.273
But they don't at all naturally
cluster with just any or all

00:38:21.273 --> 00:38:24.190
signifiers,
so that you get associative

00:38:24.190 --> 00:38:26.780
clusters in the axis of
selection,

00:38:26.780 --> 00:38:29.739
and they are indicated by this
[gestures to board].

00:38:29.739 --> 00:38:32.800
As the chain of signifiers
unfolds,

00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:38.690
the one or another of these
possible associations links on--

00:38:38.690 --> 00:38:43.849
and remember all of these
signifiers are made up,

00:38:43.849 --> 00:38:47.730
in turn, of a chain of
concentric circles.

00:38:47.730 --> 00:38:52.440
So I think this is a rather
good way of understanding the

00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:54.460
unfolding of metonymy.
 

00:38:54.460 --> 00:38:57.300
Now every once in a while you
get metaphor--

00:38:57.300 --> 00:39:02.061
whoa!--and it's a moment to be
celebrated in Lacan because

00:39:02.061 --> 00:39:04.619
it's,
as he says, "poetic"

00:39:04.619 --> 00:39:07.244
and it is also,
as he says, in a number of

00:39:07.244 --> 00:39:10.063
places the manifestation,
the only possible

00:39:10.063 --> 00:39:12.260
manifestation,
of the symptom.

00:39:12.260 --> 00:39:13.268
What is the symptom?
 

00:39:13.268 --> 00:39:19.956
It is the awareness of the lack
of an object of desire expressed

00:39:19.956 --> 00:39:23.572
in a displaced manner--
that is to say,

00:39:23.572 --> 00:39:25.949
expressed in a manner which is
not,

00:39:25.949 --> 00:39:31.190
however, completely obfuscatory
of the lack of the object of

00:39:31.190 --> 00:39:33.862
desire,
just sort of caught up in my

00:39:33.862 --> 00:39:37.324
endless babbling;
but rather is that moment of

00:39:37.324 --> 00:39:42.038
pause in which there is a
gathering together of signifiers

00:39:42.038 --> 00:39:44.398
and,
ultimately, a substitution of

00:39:44.398 --> 00:39:47.679
one signifier for another in
such a way that one says,

00:39:47.679 --> 00:39:48.643
"Aha.
 

00:39:48.643 --> 00:39:49.510
I see it.
 

00:39:49.510 --> 00:39:52.690
I can't grasp it,
I can't have it,

00:39:52.690 --> 00:39:54.329
but I see it.
 

00:39:54.329 --> 00:39:56.320
I see the object of desire.
 

00:39:56.320 --> 00:39:59.753
I see what has been displaced
by the very act of

00:39:59.753 --> 00:40:01.360
signification."
 

00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:03.748
That's what he calls
"metaphor,"

00:40:03.748 --> 00:40:06.896
and he sees metaphor as
appearing at these points de

00:40:06.896 --> 00:40:07.829
capiton.
 

00:40:07.829 --> 00:40:09.320
Think of this as a quilt.
 

00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:19.182
You know what I'm talking
about: quilting knots,

00:40:19.182 --> 00:40:24.219
pins--no, not needles.
 

00:40:24.219 --> 00:40:26.840
That's what you make a quilt
with.

00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:29.675
* Those little
buttons, quilting buttons,

00:40:29.675 --> 00:40:30.079
right?
 

00:40:30.079 --> 00:40:31.469
That's what a quilt is like.
 

00:40:31.469 --> 00:40:35.853
It's filled with something and
then the stuffing is held in

00:40:35.853 --> 00:40:37.289
place by buttons.
 

00:40:37.289 --> 00:40:37.739
Right?
 

00:40:37.739 --> 00:40:42.358
So the stuffing of metonymic
signification is held in place

00:40:42.358 --> 00:40:45.411
usefully for the analyst,
for the reader,

00:40:45.411 --> 00:40:48.204
and for the interpreter by
these quilting buttons or

00:40:48.204 --> 00:40:49.739
points de capiton.
 

00:40:49.739 --> 00:40:55.074
So the example that Lacan gives
is--as I say,

00:40:55.074 --> 00:40:58.469
he gives several examples.
 

00:40:58.469 --> 00:41:01.646
There are wonderful,
dazzling readings,

00:41:01.646 --> 00:41:06.076
both with four lines from
Valéry and of the one

00:41:06.076 --> 00:41:08.250
line from Victor Hugo.
 

00:41:08.250 --> 00:41:11.306
I focus on the Hugo because
it's a little easier,

00:41:11.306 --> 00:41:12.579
just the one line.
 

00:41:12.579 --> 00:41:16.210
He says, "There is
something that happens in this

00:41:16.210 --> 00:41:20.387
line which is metaphoric,"
and I'm delighted that he uses

00:41:20.387 --> 00:41:22.579
the word "sparks."
 

00:41:22.579 --> 00:41:24.514
In other words,
the metaphoric,

00:41:24.514 --> 00:41:27.289
the presence of the metaphor,
is a spark.

00:41:27.289 --> 00:41:30.650
Remember I was talking about,
in Wolfgang Iser,

00:41:30.650 --> 00:41:33.969
the need to gap a sparkplug:
in other words,

00:41:33.969 --> 00:41:37.215
the need to have a certain
distance between two points in

00:41:37.215 --> 00:41:39.070
order for the spark to happen.
 

00:41:39.070 --> 00:41:40.659
If it's too close,
it doesn't happen;

00:41:40.659 --> 00:41:41.969
you just short out.
 

00:41:41.969 --> 00:41:44.782
If it's too distant,
it doesn't happen because the

00:41:44.782 --> 00:41:46.159
distance is too great.
 

00:41:46.159 --> 00:41:49.706
So the spark that Lacan is
talking about is the

00:41:49.706 --> 00:41:52.795
relationship--
"his sheaves were neither

00:41:52.795 --> 00:41:59.480
miserly nor spiteful"--
between Boaz and his sheaves;

00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:01.780
because the sheaves themselves
which give of themselves--

00:42:01.780 --> 00:42:07.224
just as certain other things we
could mention give of

00:42:07.224 --> 00:42:10.998
themselves--
the sheaves themselves which

00:42:10.998 --> 00:42:14.755
give of themselves,
and certainly are not miserly

00:42:14.755 --> 00:42:17.635
or spiteful for that reason--
they're generous,

00:42:17.635 --> 00:42:18.840
they're open,
they give,

00:42:18.840 --> 00:42:23.340
they feed us,
etc., etc., etc.--are supposed,

00:42:23.340 --> 00:42:27.293
in metonymy,
to indicate that Boaz is like

00:42:27.293 --> 00:42:27.969
that.
 

00:42:27.969 --> 00:42:31.268
Look at the munificence of
Boaz's crop.

00:42:31.268 --> 00:42:35.934
It's neither miserly nor
spiteful, but as Lacan points

00:42:35.934 --> 00:42:37.762
out,
the miserliness and

00:42:37.762 --> 00:42:41.400
spitefulness comes back in an
unfortunate way precisely in

00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:44.719
that word "his":
&gt;

00:42:44.719 --> 00:42:49.969
because if he is a possessor of
the sheaf,

00:42:49.969 --> 00:42:57.159
he is--this involves the whole,
as it were,

00:42:57.159 --> 00:43:01.418
structure of capitalist or
Darwinian competition and

00:43:01.418 --> 00:43:04.885
involves,
at least in an underlying way,

00:43:04.885 --> 00:43:08.414
all the elements of thrift,
if you will,

00:43:08.414 --> 00:43:12.467
and competitive envy or spite,
if you will,

00:43:12.467 --> 00:43:16.710
that seem to have been banished
from the sentence.

00:43:16.710 --> 00:43:20.768
In other words,
metaphorically speaking,

00:43:20.768 --> 00:43:23.889
Boaz returns in his absence.
 

00:43:23.889 --> 00:43:26.119
He substitutes.
 

00:43:26.119 --> 00:43:30.829
He is substituted for by the
expression "his

00:43:30.829 --> 00:43:32.400
sheaves."
 

00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:37.311
The possessive means that he is
not the things that he's said to

00:43:37.311 --> 00:43:39.634
be,
metonymically speaking,

00:43:39.634 --> 00:43:44.228
and the sheaves themselves are
precisely what he is in the

00:43:44.228 --> 00:43:46.969
Oedipal phase:
that is to say,

00:43:46.969 --> 00:43:52.795
precisely what he is if he is
objectified by a baby looking at

00:43:52.795 --> 00:43:55.710
him;
but at the same time,

00:43:55.710 --> 00:44:01.059
not at all what or where we
expected him to be.

00:44:01.059 --> 00:44:05.201
In other words,
the point de capiton of

00:44:05.201 --> 00:44:07.501
the sentence,
of the line,

00:44:07.501 --> 00:44:13.206
is the substitution of Boaz for
his sheaves and his sheaves for

00:44:13.206 --> 00:44:14.219
Boaz.
 

00:44:14.219 --> 00:44:18.630
So the line has both a
metonymic reading and a

00:44:18.630 --> 00:44:20.690
metaphoric reading.
 

00:44:20.690 --> 00:44:24.335
Here I think you can see
Lacan's sense of the relation

00:44:24.335 --> 00:44:27.911
between metaphor or metonymy
hovering between that of

00:44:27.911 --> 00:44:30.869
Jakobson or Brooks and that of
de Man,

00:44:30.869 --> 00:44:36.681
because there seems to be an
underlying irreducible tension

00:44:36.681 --> 00:44:42.193
between reading the line as
though it says that Boaz was

00:44:42.193 --> 00:44:47.579
generous and free of spite,
and reading the line as though

00:44:47.579 --> 00:44:50.268
it said that Boaz just
necessarily--

00:44:50.268 --> 00:44:52.949
because he's one who possesses
something--

00:44:52.949 --> 00:44:57.771
is a person who has the
characteristics of miserliness

00:44:57.771 --> 00:44:59.500
and spitefulness.
 

00:44:59.500 --> 00:45:01.367
The tension,
in other words,

00:45:01.367 --> 00:45:05.309
seems to me to be in Lacan an
irreducible one so that,

00:45:05.309 --> 00:45:09.619
at least in that regard,
we can place him closer to de

00:45:09.619 --> 00:45:13.768
Man than we have to,
say, Brooks or Jakobson;

00:45:13.768 --> 00:45:18.130
which isn't to say that
Jakobson is not the primary and

00:45:18.130 --> 00:45:23.056
central influence on Lacan's way
of thinking about the axis of

00:45:23.056 --> 00:45:24.349
combination.
 

00:45:24.349 --> 00:45:29.699
The appearance of metaphor on
the axis of combination,

00:45:29.699 --> 00:45:33.536
the way in which we can
identify these quilting buttons

00:45:33.536 --> 00:45:38.038
on the axis of combination,
is nothing other than what

00:45:38.038 --> 00:45:43.775
Jakobson said and meant when he
said that the poetic function is

00:45:43.775 --> 00:45:48.512
the transference of the
principle of equivalence from

00:45:48.512 --> 00:45:52.885
the axis of selection to the
axis of combination,

00:45:52.885 --> 00:45:54.070
right?
 

00:45:54.070 --> 00:45:57.471
I'm not saying--in speaking in
passing of the sort of

00:45:57.471 --> 00:46:01.394
irreducible conflict one senses
between metonymy and metaphor

00:46:01.394 --> 00:46:04.737
here--
I'm not saying that Jakobson is

00:46:04.737 --> 00:46:10.460
not the primary influence behind
Lacan's thinking in this regard.

00:46:10.460 --> 00:46:11.365
All right.
 

00:46:11.365 --> 00:46:14.719
Now Lacan says language is a
rebus,

00:46:14.719 --> 00:46:17.846
as I've said,
and he says the movement of the

00:46:17.846 --> 00:46:20.510
signifier,
which is the movement of

00:46:20.510 --> 00:46:23.340
desire, is the articulation of a
lack.

00:46:23.340 --> 00:46:26.909
That is to say,
it is in the impossibility,

00:46:26.909 --> 00:46:32.780
as certain kinds of language
philosophers would say,

00:46:32.780 --> 00:46:38.150
of making the signifier hook on
to the signified or,

00:46:38.150 --> 00:46:40.869
as we might say,
hook up with the signified--

00:46:40.869 --> 00:46:45.460
in the impossibility of doing
that is precisely the

00:46:45.460 --> 00:46:49.960
impossibility of realizing an
object of desire.

00:46:49.960 --> 00:46:55.199
So all of this should I hope
now be clear.

00:46:55.199 --> 00:46:59.550
So some of the consequences are
that language--

00:46:59.550 --> 00:47:02.717
the most obvious consequence
is, and this isn't the first

00:47:02.717 --> 00:47:06.226
time or last time that we will
have encountered this in various

00:47:06.226 --> 00:47:10.492
vocabularies and contexts--
that "language thinks

00:47:10.492 --> 00:47:11.460
me."
 

00:47:11.460 --> 00:47:14.237
On page 1142,
the right-hand column,

00:47:14.237 --> 00:47:17.489
for example:
"I think where I am not,

00:47:17.489 --> 00:47:21.139
therefore I am where I do not
think."

00:47:21.139 --> 00:47:25.443
That is to say,
that which brings my thinking

00:47:25.443 --> 00:47:28.769
into being is not present to me.
 

00:47:28.769 --> 00:47:29.579
It is it.
 

00:47:29.579 --> 00:47:31.719
It is the letter.
 

00:47:31.719 --> 00:47:40.088
It is the signified which
perpetually evades us and which

00:47:40.088 --> 00:47:45.320
cannot possibly be present to
us.

00:47:45.320 --> 00:47:47.190
I am not present to myself.
 

00:47:47.190 --> 00:47:52.021
I cannot be present to myself
because what is present is the

00:47:52.021 --> 00:47:57.099
way in which my self comes into
being in discourse which cannot

00:47:57.099 --> 00:47:58.409
identify me.
 

00:47:58.409 --> 00:48:03.000
It cannot identify me either as
subject,

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:08.230
or, in a phase of narcissism,
supposing I can somehow or

00:48:08.230 --> 00:48:12.889
another re-imagine myself in the
mirror phase,

00:48:12.889 --> 00:48:16.250
as an object of desire.
 

00:48:16.250 --> 00:48:17.335
All right.
 

00:48:17.335 --> 00:48:23.201
So I actually think that
without quite having meant to,

00:48:23.201 --> 00:48:29.393
I have pretty much exhausted
what I have to say in outline

00:48:29.393 --> 00:48:31.239
about Lacan.
 

00:48:31.239 --> 00:48:35.353
I haven't said nearly enough
about the relationship between

00:48:35.353 --> 00:48:39.394
desire and need as it plots
itself in our actual lives and

00:48:39.394 --> 00:48:42.655
in fiction,
because the extraordinary thing

00:48:42.655 --> 00:48:46.563
about it is it's not just a
slogan from the Rolling Stones

00:48:46.563 --> 00:48:47.730
or from Lacan.
 

00:48:47.730 --> 00:48:52.643
As we think about it,
it's not that we're not happy

00:48:52.643 --> 00:48:57.556
with our relationship with the
things that we need:

00:48:57.556 --> 00:49:01.373
obviously we are,
but the extraordinary thing

00:49:01.373 --> 00:49:04.130
about it is that we recognize in
our lives,

00:49:04.130 --> 00:49:08.349
in the magical world of
film--that is to say,

00:49:08.349 --> 00:49:12.313
the world of illusion
deliberately promoted by film

00:49:12.313 --> 00:49:16.188
and in fiction--
we recognize the absolutely

00:49:16.188 --> 00:49:20.000
central significance of this
distinction.

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:24.507
That's what's so wonderful and
amazing about the essay by

00:49:24.507 --> 00:49:29.255
Å―iÅūek you'll be reading for
next week called "Courtly

00:49:29.255 --> 00:49:33.280
Love," which I love and
which headlines,

00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:37.965
which features readings of a
series of films in which the

00:49:37.965 --> 00:49:43.239
Lacanian distinction between the
impossibility ever of achieving

00:49:43.239 --> 00:49:46.880
the Big Other--
by the way, there are times in

00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:51.119
various kinds of fictional plots
in which you can actually have

00:49:51.119 --> 00:49:54.684
the object of desire,
but what always happens in

00:49:54.684 --> 00:49:57.679
plots like that is that the
unconscious,

00:49:57.679 --> 00:50:01.289
the psyche, finds ways of
rejecting it.

00:50:01.289 --> 00:50:03.900
I can't have that--it's my
brother;

00:50:03.900 --> 00:50:09.340
or I can't have that--it is in
one form or another forbidden.

00:50:09.340 --> 00:50:11.818
In other words,
in actuality,

00:50:11.818 --> 00:50:17.309
in the way in which the psyche
works according to the structure

00:50:17.309 --> 00:50:21.559
of the films Å―iÅūek undertakes
to analyze--

00:50:21.559 --> 00:50:24.476
and he's so profuse in examples
that he really does leave us

00:50:24.476 --> 00:50:27.195
feeling that there's a kind of
universality in what he's

00:50:27.195 --> 00:50:30.378
saying--
yeah, there are all kinds of

00:50:30.378 --> 00:50:36.018
object choices that can happen
and do happen and may even seem

00:50:36.018 --> 00:50:39.916
satisfactory,
but those are all objects,

00:50:39.916 --> 00:50:44.771
objets petit ā;
whereas the Big Other,

00:50:44.771 --> 00:50:50.396
that which is the true object
of desire, is something that

00:50:50.396 --> 00:50:54.050
will perpetually evade
possession.

00:50:54.050 --> 00:50:54.679
Okay.
 

00:50:54.679 --> 00:50:57.757
So next time we're actually
talking about the anxiety of

00:50:57.757 --> 00:51:01.320
influence in Harold Bloom,
and then in the ensuing lecture

00:51:01.320 --> 00:51:04.889
we'll return in a way to Lacan
when we take up Deleuze,

00:51:04.889 --> 00:51:07.679
Guattari and Slavoj Å―iÅūek.
 

00:51:07.679 --> 00:51:09.000
Thank you.

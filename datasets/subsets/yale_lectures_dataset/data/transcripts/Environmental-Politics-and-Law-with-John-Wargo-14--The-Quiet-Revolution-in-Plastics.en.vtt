00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:03.746
Prof: Today I want to
talk about what I think of as

00:00:03.746 --> 00:00:06.206
one of the most significant
failures of environmental law in

00:00:06.206 --> 00:00:07.290
the twentieth century.
 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.760
And this is the way that we
manage toxic substances.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.587
But this is a story that is
more about not just the

00:00:15.587 --> 00:00:20.027
individual chemicals but also
the products that are created

00:00:20.027 --> 00:00:23.090
when chemicals are merged
together,

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:24.230
they're synthesized.
 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.550
So what is the plastics problem
?

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.030
In part, it's the enormity of
the industry.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:34.986
About 119 billion pounds now
produced each year in the United

00:00:34.986 --> 00:00:35.730
States.
 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.030
This is roughly about a $400
billion industry.

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.324
And I mentioned earlier that
just to give you a point of

00:00:42.324 --> 00:00:44.720
comparison to the pesticide
industry,

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.690
the pesticide industry produces
about ten billion pounds.

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.260
So it's about ten times smaller
than the plastics industry.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.570
And the annual sales from
pesticides are about ten to

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.548
twelve billion dollars per year
in the nation.

00:01:00.548 --> 00:01:04.528
So compared to the attention
that pesticides have been given

00:01:04.528 --> 00:01:07.159
over the past thirty to forty
years,

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:10.596
the plastics problem has been
just about fully neglected by

00:01:10.596 --> 00:01:11.250
Congress.
 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.942
Although it did pass the Toxic
Substance control act back in

00:01:15.942 --> 00:01:16.500
1976.
 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.013
And this law was intended to
encourage premarket testing of

00:01:20.013 --> 00:01:20.739
chemicals.
 

00:01:20.739 --> 00:01:24.572
And what we'll see today is
that the majority of chemicals

00:01:24.572 --> 00:01:27.989
remain untested,
that the ingredients are

00:01:27.989 --> 00:01:30.622
unlabeled,
the country of origin is

00:01:30.622 --> 00:01:32.379
unknown for most products.
 

00:01:32.379 --> 00:01:36.680
The recovery rate is
exceptionally low.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.546
And recycling failure occurs
for many reasons,

00:01:40.546 --> 00:01:45.530
but we'll explore several of
those later in the session.

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.410
Environmental contamination at
a global scale has occurred.

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:54.498
There are plastic particles,
molecules in ambient air

00:01:54.498 --> 00:01:56.230
outside and indoors.
 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:59.938
Plastics have contaminated
underground aquifers as well as

00:01:59.938 --> 00:02:03.780
surface waters in many parts of
the industrialized world.

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.578
There's been universal human
exposure.

00:02:06.578 --> 00:02:09.310
That exposure is chronic,
you get it on a daily basis.

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.403
And the health effects that we
now are beginning to understand

00:02:14.403 --> 00:02:19.750
have to do predominately with
endocrine disrupting compounds,

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.030
chemicals that are mimicking
human hormones.

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.169
We rely, unfortunately,
for the most part on animal

00:02:26.169 --> 00:02:30.061
studies to give us some insight
into what the effects on humans

00:02:30.061 --> 00:02:31.378
are likely to be.
 

00:02:31.378 --> 00:02:35.401
But we rely on that evidence
for many other classes of

00:02:35.401 --> 00:02:36.919
compounds as well.
 

00:02:36.919 --> 00:02:40.675
So this area has received
virtually no attention from the

00:02:40.675 --> 00:02:44.901
Environmental Protection Agency,
and I want to talk a little bit

00:02:44.901 --> 00:02:46.780
today about why that is.
 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:52.020
So 850,000 people employed in
this industry.

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:57.508
That number 379 is now up about
$400 billion per year,

00:02:57.508 --> 00:03:01.400
and plastics comprise seventy
percent of the synthetic

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.938
chemical industry in the nation,
including 500 different resins.

00:03:06.938 --> 00:03:09.060
Plastics labeling is confusing
to many people.

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:14.144
You may not look on the bottom
of a milk carton or you may not

00:03:14.144 --> 00:03:18.562
look on the back of many
different products to look at

00:03:18.562 --> 00:03:20.479
the recycling code.
 

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:23.299
The recycling code in the
United States is completely

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:23.949
voluntary.
 

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:27.750
There is no legal obligation to
post the chemical content,

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.816
the origin of the plastics or
what should be done with it once

00:03:31.816 --> 00:03:33.750
the product is discarded.
 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.449
So, give you an example here.
 

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:40.020
Polyethylene,
PET, has the symbol number one.

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:45.620
So bottled drinks such as Pepsi
and Coca Cola are packaged in

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:46.180
PET.
 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.020
Sometimes it's called PETE,
polyethylene.

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.840
There's a high-density version
of that, which is number two.

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.524
And there's a low density
version of that,

00:03:53.524 --> 00:03:54.470
which is number four.
 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:58.169
So carrier bags and bin liners,
for example,

00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:02.211
are the low-density
polyethylene as opposed to say

00:04:02.211 --> 00:04:07.408
the gallon milk jugs which are
the high-density polyethylene.

00:04:07.408 --> 00:04:11.137
The polyethylenes are the most
likely to be recycled among all

00:04:11.137 --> 00:04:11.810
plastics.
 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:14.959
Polyvinylchloride,
by comparison,

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:19.290
PVC for short,
is contained in many different

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:20.569
products.
 

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:22.706
Water pipes,
and I'll show you some examples

00:04:22.706 --> 00:04:24.050
of that in a few moments.
 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:28.434
It's almost never recycled,
which means that it's either

00:04:28.434 --> 00:04:32.660
buried or it's burned once it is
finally discarded.

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:38.043
Polypropylene,
you may find polypropylene in

00:04:38.043 --> 00:04:38.920
rugs.
 

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:41.762
You can find it also in
margarine tubs,

00:04:41.762 --> 00:04:45.129
different kinds of food
packaging products.

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:48.110
But also in these microwavable
meal trays.

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.110
Polystyrene,
most people understand what

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:52.110
styrene is.
 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.379
You are all familiar with
styrene balls.

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:59.242
But it's also an absorbent
material that's put at the base

00:04:59.242 --> 00:05:01.290
of meats in packaging.
 

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:05.235
And I mentioned to you that the
packaging problem is,

00:05:05.235 --> 00:05:09.180
especially related to food,
is incredibly complex.

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.735
There's no way for you to know
what chemicals are in the

00:05:11.735 --> 00:05:14.338
packaging materials that you buy
in the grocery store.

00:05:14.338 --> 00:05:20.319
Seven is reserved for other
kinds of plastic resins.

00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:23.740
So only those that do not fall
into the other categories are

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.189
given the number seven.
 

00:05:25.189 --> 00:05:28.043
And we'll concentrate on one of
those today, which is called

00:05:28.043 --> 00:05:28.720
bisphenol-A.
 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:32.351
Bisphenol-A is what's used to
form polycarbonate plastic

00:05:32.351 --> 00:05:35.389
that's very dense,
very hard, and often it's in

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:36.379
clear form.
 

00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:37.079
It can be colored.
 

00:05:37.079 --> 00:05:41.512
So Nalgene bottles are a good
example of number seven,

00:05:41.512 --> 00:05:43.269
the polycarbonates.
 

00:05:43.269 --> 00:05:48.403
And also you might think of the
headlamps on a car or a

00:05:48.403 --> 00:05:51.350
motorcycle helmet or a visor.
 

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:53.690
These are all examples of
polycarbonate.

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:59.632
Here is a chart that lists the
recycling rate in yellow for all

00:05:59.632 --> 00:06:02.699
the different classifications.
 

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:06.730
And you basically see PVCs are
at the bottom of the list.

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:10.473
So PVCs are not recycled
because the chemical content is

00:06:10.473 --> 00:06:11.629
so complicated.
 

00:06:11.629 --> 00:06:16.800
The highest degree of recycling
occurs with the polyethylenes.

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:20.124
So the PETE bottles have
roughly a twenty to twenty-five

00:06:20.124 --> 00:06:23.569
percent recycling rate on
average in the United States.

00:06:23.569 --> 00:06:26.610
And this is highly variable by
region in the nation.

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:29.410
And also by time of the year.
 

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:33.569
The polypropylene is almost
never recycled,

00:06:33.569 --> 00:06:35.649
nor is polystyrene.
 

00:06:35.649 --> 00:06:40.386
Polycarbonates,
the hard plastic composite that

00:06:40.386 --> 00:06:43.887
exists, for example,
in my glasses,

00:06:43.887 --> 00:06:48.110
these are also almost never
recycled.

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:49.250
So what happens to them?
 

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:52.413
I'm going to take you on a
quick Cook's Tour of plastic in

00:06:52.413 --> 00:06:53.079
your life.
 

00:06:53.079 --> 00:06:56.017
And you remember that I
challenged you to try to find

00:06:56.017 --> 00:06:59.240
out if you could avoid
purchasing plastics for a week,

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:02.317
and if you are able to do that,
I challenged you to avoid using

00:07:02.317 --> 00:07:03.410
plastics for a week.
 

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:06.480
And I believe that today is a
virtual impossibility.

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:10.562
So I started to do a little
inventory in my own life and

00:07:10.562 --> 00:07:15.166
actually got quite disturbed at
myself and my own ignorance and

00:07:15.166 --> 00:07:17.839
what I had exposed my family to.
 

00:07:17.839 --> 00:07:22.014
And I became extremely
interested in trying to kind of

00:07:22.014 --> 00:07:26.346
reconstruct why I was so
clueless about the thousands of

00:07:26.346 --> 00:07:31.307
different products that had made
their way into my life and into

00:07:31.307 --> 00:07:33.120
my family's life.
 

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:35.420
Contact lenses are a good
example.

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:37.860
There are hard contact lenses
and there are soft contact

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:38.259
lenses.
 

00:07:38.259 --> 00:07:41.401
The hard lenses could contain
bisphenol-A, it's a

00:07:41.401 --> 00:07:42.449
polycarbonate.
 

00:07:42.449 --> 00:07:46.526
The softer contact lenses that
will change their shape with

00:07:46.526 --> 00:07:50.322
your eye or as they rotate
across a surface that is not

00:07:50.322 --> 00:07:53.954
completely even,
those contact lenses normally

00:07:53.954 --> 00:07:55.440
contain phthalates.
 

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:59.622
Phthalates are softeners,
so bisphenol-A is the hardener,

00:07:59.622 --> 00:08:01.639
phthalates are softeners.
 

00:08:01.639 --> 00:08:05.740
And these phthalates are a
particular problem with respect

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:09.122
to one, which is called diethyl
phthalate, DEHP,

00:08:09.122 --> 00:08:12.290
that I'll talk about a little
bit later.

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:15.160
My daughter wears a retainer.
 

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:17.779
She's ten years old,
my youngest daughter.

00:08:17.779 --> 00:08:19.730
And I don't know what's in that.
 

00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:22.170
But I would imagine that it's
predominately polycarbonate.

00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:26.329
She wears it about twelve to
fifteen hours per day.

00:08:26.329 --> 00:08:29.899
And also, most people have
dental sealants.

00:08:29.899 --> 00:08:31.920
Dental sealants are pretty
interesting.

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:36.421
So that you can test people's
saliva after the dental sealants

00:08:36.421 --> 00:08:40.850
are put in and you can find the
bisphenol-A in the saliva.

00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:45.136
Also, there's a protective
characteristic of these

00:08:45.136 --> 00:08:46.100
sealants.
 

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:49.202
They prevent you from getting
cavities that would demand

00:08:49.202 --> 00:08:52.303
putting a different kind of
plastic into your tooth or a

00:08:52.303 --> 00:08:53.320
metal amalgam.
 

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:56.700
And many people in my
generation and my parents'

00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:00.871
generation have fillings in
their mouths that include metal

00:09:00.871 --> 00:09:04.076
amalgams,
including compounds such as

00:09:04.076 --> 00:09:04.808
mercury.
 

00:09:04.808 --> 00:09:07.778
So it's a very interesting kind
of a tradeoff one might make.

00:09:07.778 --> 00:09:12.918
Think about different other
sources of plastic in your life.

00:09:12.918 --> 00:09:15.572
Most of you are probably
familiar with that smell of the

00:09:15.572 --> 00:09:18.514
vinyl shower curtain when you
first open the package and for a

00:09:18.514 --> 00:09:21.070
couple of days it's off gassing
in your bathroom.

00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:24.255
Different kinds of clothing,
raincoats, fabrics,

00:09:24.255 --> 00:09:27.442
GORE-TEX, for example,
are made out of different

00:09:27.442 --> 00:09:28.730
plastic resins.
 

00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:33.850
And these also are generally
non-recyclable.

00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:36.100
And I want you to think about
the built environment.

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:39.251
When a house is built in the
Northeastern part of the U.S.,

00:09:39.251 --> 00:09:41.210
it's generally framed out of
wood.

00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:44.509
You see the plywood there
that's being tacked onto these

00:09:44.509 --> 00:09:46.370
two by fours or two by sixes.
 

00:09:46.370 --> 00:09:50.676
And then you see the plastic
sheathing that is being attached

00:09:50.676 --> 00:09:52.830
made by DuPont called Tyvek.
 

00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:59.649
Tyvek is an interesting product
in that it seals the house from

00:09:59.649 --> 00:10:00.418
mold.
 

00:10:00.418 --> 00:10:04.446
And that also has a protective
effect in that molds are known

00:10:04.446 --> 00:10:08.404
to threaten human health and
induce asthma or exacerbate it,

00:10:08.404 --> 00:10:09.678
as one example.
 

00:10:09.678 --> 00:10:13.200
But this product also is
extremely rarely recycled.

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:17.908
Tyvek also you can find in a
variety of different settings.

00:10:17.908 --> 00:10:22.211
Here's a Tyvek disposable
coverall that is claimed by the

00:10:22.211 --> 00:10:26.283
corporation to protect against
more than 150 hazardous

00:10:26.283 --> 00:10:27.360
chemicals.
 

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:30.000
So for those people that work
with hazardous chemicals,

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.250
here's a product that helps to
protect them.

00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:36.178
The idea of it being disposable
caught my attention.

00:10:36.178 --> 00:10:37.860
It's advertised as being
disposable.

00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:40.381
Certainly most things are
disposable, but that doesn't

00:10:40.381 --> 00:10:43.238
give you any clue about where
they might end up eventually in

00:10:43.238 --> 00:10:44.190
the environment.
 

00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:47.394
In this case,
this will not break down for

00:10:47.394 --> 00:10:50.990
probably hundreds if not
thousands of years.

00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:52.480
Now think about a house.
 

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:56.408
This house has plastic in many
different areas.

00:10:56.408 --> 00:10:59.192
It's got vinyl siding on it,
it has pillars,

00:10:59.192 --> 00:11:03.139
you can see pillars here on the
front and over on the side.

00:11:03.139 --> 00:11:05.634
You might think those pillars
are formed out of wood or

00:11:05.634 --> 00:11:08.500
perhaps that they're ceramic,
but they're generally plastic.

00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:11.788
You see the light post,
that's plastic as well.

00:11:11.788 --> 00:11:16.667
You see the railing on top of
the front porch near the front

00:11:16.667 --> 00:11:17.658
door here.
 

00:11:17.658 --> 00:11:22.500
This is also probably a
polyvinylchloride plastic.

00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:24.778
Also the doors are commonly
plastic.

00:11:24.778 --> 00:11:27.340
The windows,
the window frames are plastic.

00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:28.950
And how do they seal?
 

00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:32.434
When your door shuts,
it doesn't shut with hard

00:11:32.434 --> 00:11:36.681
plastic meeting hard plastic,
it's got a separate liner that

00:11:36.681 --> 00:11:40.264
lies next to the door that will
absorb the shock and also it

00:11:40.264 --> 00:11:42.389
will prevent heat from escaping.
 

00:11:42.389 --> 00:11:46.240
So generally with a window,
you'll have several different

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:48.990
kinds of plastic,
the same with doors.

00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:53.240
The vent that you see up here
near the peak of the roof also

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:54.610
would be plastic.
 

00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:58.457
So that the exterior surfaces
of this structure are

00:11:58.457 --> 00:12:01.230
predominately made out of
plastic.

00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:04.149
Many paints also contain
plastics within them.

00:12:04.149 --> 00:12:09.870
Think also about cord or wire.
 

00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:14.668
Wire is generally coated with
vinyl, polyvinylchloride.

00:12:14.668 --> 00:12:18.996
And just as an example,
there are, in a new building

00:12:18.996 --> 00:12:22.325
like Kroon Hall,
where I've got my office,

00:12:22.325 --> 00:12:26.577
there are probably hundreds of
miles of electrical conduit that

00:12:26.577 --> 00:12:29.460
circulate through that single
building.

00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:34.048
And then think about power
lines and the sheathing that

00:12:34.048 --> 00:12:36.428
exists on the power lines.
 

00:12:36.428 --> 00:12:39.923
Well how many miles of power
line do you think there are in

00:12:39.923 --> 00:12:41.129
the United States?
 

00:12:41.129 --> 00:12:44.958
Well, one thing you could do is
you could just calculate on

00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:47.221
Google,
type in number of miles of

00:12:47.221 --> 00:12:51.014
roads in the United States,
because most roads are also

00:12:51.014 --> 00:12:53.019
corridors for power lines.
 

00:12:53.019 --> 00:12:56.509
So I would estimate that we
probably have hundreds of

00:12:56.509 --> 00:13:00.134
billions of miles of electrical
cable that's sheeted in

00:13:00.134 --> 00:13:03.759
polyvinylchloride,
all of which is not recyclable.

00:13:03.759 --> 00:13:07.071
Interestingly,
the value of copper inside the

00:13:07.071 --> 00:13:10.759
wire is high enough to encourage
its recycling.

00:13:10.759 --> 00:13:13.639
But the value of the PVC is
negligible.

00:13:13.639 --> 00:13:18.970
Now I'd also like you to think
about your own water supply.

00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:20.408
Think about where you grew up.
 

00:13:20.408 --> 00:13:22.250
Do you know where your water
came from?

00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:25.918
Do you know how it was piped to
your facets?

00:13:25.918 --> 00:13:29.375
Well, here's an example of a
water supply being fed by copper

00:13:29.375 --> 00:13:30.470
pipes at the top.
 

00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:34.629
And then there's a distribution
network throughout the house,

00:13:34.629 --> 00:13:38.399
going to say the refrigerator
or going to the kitchen sink,

00:13:38.399 --> 00:13:41.298
going to toilets in different
parts of the house.

00:13:41.298 --> 00:13:45.110
Well this also is made out of
plastic.

00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:48.938
And one would think that
somebody would have demanded

00:13:48.938 --> 00:13:53.211
that these chemicals be tested
to understand whether or not

00:13:53.211 --> 00:13:56.009
they would leach out of the
lines.

00:13:56.009 --> 00:13:58.519
And in many cases,
particularly with newer houses,

00:13:58.519 --> 00:14:00.259
you'll have a filtration
system.

00:14:00.259 --> 00:14:03.000
And you may have seen these
cartridge filtration systems.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.210
They look like canisters.
 

00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:05.870
They come in various sizes.
 

00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:09.000
I've got one in my house that's
a sediment filter as one

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:09.570
example.
 

00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:13.226
And it was put in before I
understood this whole plastics

00:14:13.226 --> 00:14:13.750
issue.
 

00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:16.692
And I also can tell you that
it's almost impossible to find a

00:14:16.692 --> 00:14:18.950
water filter that's not made out
of plastic.

00:14:18.950 --> 00:14:22.269
So within this plastic
canister, it's got a top that

00:14:22.269 --> 00:14:23.048
screws on.
 

00:14:23.048 --> 00:14:27.174
So to change the filtration you
take the filter material out and

00:14:27.174 --> 00:14:31.168
then you put a new one in after
a certain number of months.

00:14:31.168 --> 00:14:35.950
So that most water filters also
are plastic.

00:14:35.950 --> 00:14:37.961
Also, nobody asked the
question, well,

00:14:37.961 --> 00:14:41.058
what's leaching out of the
filters into the water line?

00:14:41.058 --> 00:14:43.730
Now I'd like you to think about
the vehicle environment.

00:14:43.730 --> 00:14:45.399
It's kind of interesting.
 

00:14:45.399 --> 00:14:48.105
I use the phrase that people
are spending in the United

00:14:48.105 --> 00:14:50.710
States about ninety percent of
their time indoors.

00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:53.943
Well it's about eighty-seven
percent of their time indoors

00:14:53.943 --> 00:14:57.121
and it's about three to four
percent of their time within

00:14:57.121 --> 00:14:57.860
vehicles.
 

00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:00.658
And think about the interior
cabins.

00:15:00.658 --> 00:15:05.120
On the upper left here,
a new vehicle,

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:08.827
so that this probably has maybe
a couple of dozen different

00:15:08.827 --> 00:15:12.203
polymers in it,
ranging from the TV screen and

00:15:12.203 --> 00:15:16.207
all of its components down
through the plastic steering

00:15:16.207 --> 00:15:18.456
wheel,
plastic dashboard,

00:15:18.456 --> 00:15:21.720
the plastic console between the
seats.

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:24.822
Different kinds of plastics in
the seat itself,

00:15:24.822 --> 00:15:27.991
including the polyurethane foam
inside the seat,

00:15:27.991 --> 00:15:30.690
almost none of which are
recyclable.

00:15:30.690 --> 00:15:34.027
So eventually most of these
parts that are made out of

00:15:34.027 --> 00:15:36.610
plastic are simply going to be
burned,

00:15:36.610 --> 00:15:40.466
which gives off quite a bit of
energy in an incinerator because

00:15:40.466 --> 00:15:43.080
of a high carbon content in the
plastic.

00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:46.899
So remember that most of these
plastics are derived from what?

00:15:46.899 --> 00:15:48.548
They're petroleum-based.
 

00:15:48.548 --> 00:15:55.322
So that it's very important to
recall that fossil fuels,

00:15:55.322 --> 00:16:00.740
oil is the predominant source
of plastics.

00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:04.605
The interior of a subway or in
this case, and Amtrak train on

00:16:04.605 --> 00:16:07.568
the upper right,
also is predominantly plastic,

00:16:07.568 --> 00:16:10.340
as is the interior of an
airline cabin.

00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:15.394
And this is all for an
interesting and really important

00:16:15.394 --> 00:16:16.330
purpose.
 

00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:18.548
And that is to lighten the
weight of the vehicle.

00:16:18.548 --> 00:16:20.792
So thirty years ago,
vehicles were much heavier than

00:16:20.792 --> 00:16:21.538
they are today.
 

00:16:21.538 --> 00:16:26.240
So an average vehicle today
might be 2,500 pounds,

00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:32.092
but an average vehicle perhaps
forty years ago was perhaps 300

00:16:32.092 --> 00:16:35.259
or 400 pounds more than that.
 

00:16:35.259 --> 00:16:38.875
Indeed, there are about 300
pounds of plastic in every new

00:16:38.875 --> 00:16:39.509
vehicle.
 

00:16:39.509 --> 00:16:42.720
And it's pretty much guaranteed
that that material would not be

00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:43.288
recycled.
 

00:16:43.288 --> 00:16:46.355
Also, I'd like you to think
about coatings,

00:16:46.355 --> 00:16:48.908
the whole idea of coating
things.

00:16:48.908 --> 00:16:54.467
I realized that fairly late in
my career that I hadn't paid any

00:16:54.467 --> 00:16:56.620
attention to coatings.
 

00:16:56.620 --> 00:16:59.528
But if you think about the
number of buildings that exist

00:16:59.528 --> 00:17:01.710
in the world,
the number of buildings in the

00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:03.918
United States,
think like say Sherwin

00:17:03.918 --> 00:17:05.950
Williams, the paint industry.
 

00:17:05.950 --> 00:17:08.130
You know what their phrase is?
 

00:17:08.130 --> 00:17:09.970
You know what their corporate
motto is?

00:17:09.970 --> 00:17:12.308
Their corporate motto is
"Cover the Earth."

00:17:12.308 --> 00:17:16.497
And you see this red paint,
their symbol is red paint that

00:17:16.497 --> 00:17:19.730
is flowing down across the top
of a globe.

00:17:19.730 --> 00:17:23.450
Well, think about the surface
area simply of this room.

00:17:23.450 --> 00:17:25.868
Think about the surface area in
your house.

00:17:25.868 --> 00:17:28.538
The flooring,
think about the walls,

00:17:28.538 --> 00:17:30.519
think about the ceiling.
 

00:17:30.519 --> 00:17:32.824
And if you're an executive for
a paint company,

00:17:32.824 --> 00:17:35.428
you're thinking "Oh my
gosh, we have such a huge

00:17:35.428 --> 00:17:35.980
market.
 

00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:38.589
Everybody is going to want to
paint something a different

00:17:38.589 --> 00:17:40.890
color,
and should we make the paints

00:17:40.890 --> 00:17:44.652
to be more stable or not quite
as stable so that they would

00:17:44.652 --> 00:17:48.348
want to repaint after a certain
number of years?"

00:17:48.348 --> 00:17:51.671
So just as another example,
I've done this myself,

00:17:51.671 --> 00:17:54.788
I've refinished floors,
which is a pretty nasty

00:17:54.788 --> 00:17:55.670
business.
 

00:17:55.670 --> 00:17:59.234
You don't want to spend much of
your life refinishing a floor,

00:17:59.234 --> 00:18:02.450
especially if you are dressed
such as this gentleman is,

00:18:02.450 --> 00:18:03.970
with no respirator on.
 

00:18:03.970 --> 00:18:07.335
Because he's breathing in a
pretty nasty mixture of dusts

00:18:07.335 --> 00:18:09.980
that include of course the wood
flooring,

00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:13.550
but it also includes the
plastic, the polyurethanes that

00:18:13.550 --> 00:18:15.368
are put down on the floor.
 

00:18:15.368 --> 00:18:17.140
You can see them right here up
on the podium.

00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:20.163
You can see the shiny coating
on top of the desk,

00:18:20.163 --> 00:18:23.626
and you can see it also on the
desks on the side of your

00:18:23.626 --> 00:18:24.318
chairs.
 

00:18:24.318 --> 00:18:27.874
So that the number of surface
coatings in the world is

00:18:27.874 --> 00:18:31.094
enormous in area,
and we don't really think about

00:18:31.094 --> 00:18:33.710
the long-term consequences of
that.

00:18:33.710 --> 00:18:36.420
What would happen if we didn't
coat these surfaces?

00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:38.539
What would happen to the floor?
 

00:18:38.539 --> 00:18:39.848
I mean, could you wash it?
 

00:18:39.848 --> 00:18:45.497
Could you not put a coating
like polyurethane or varnish on

00:18:45.497 --> 00:18:47.250
walls like this?
 

00:18:47.250 --> 00:18:50.650
Would they decay or break down
more quickly?

00:18:50.650 --> 00:18:52.279
And the answer is, no.
 

00:18:52.279 --> 00:18:55.981
And I've been wondering about
that and I've been wondering

00:18:55.981 --> 00:18:58.970
about the origin or aesthetic of
smoothness.

00:18:58.970 --> 00:19:02.390
We love smooth things,
whether or not it's skin,

00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:04.720
whether or not it's a surface.
 

00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:08.740
If something is rough and harsh
then it has a negative attitude

00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:09.519
toward it.
 

00:19:09.519 --> 00:19:12.375
So if you're in the business of
making these coatings,

00:19:12.375 --> 00:19:13.400
you play on that.
 

00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:16.239
Also, if you're in the business
of selling cosmetics,

00:19:16.239 --> 00:19:17.549
you also play on that.
 

00:19:17.549 --> 00:19:20.528
What about other sources?
 

00:19:20.528 --> 00:19:22.240
I've mentioned fragrances in
the past.

00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:26.386
These two contain plasticizers,
diethyl phthalate has been

00:19:26.386 --> 00:19:30.607
found in a number of common
perfumes as well as in some air

00:19:30.607 --> 00:19:31.700
fresheners.
 

00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:35.019
And also, think about other
kinds of products in your life.

00:19:35.019 --> 00:19:37.250
Now why is a diaper absorbent?
 

00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:39.858
Why is a personal hygiene
product absorbent?

00:19:39.858 --> 00:19:42.920
Well this diaper has probably
two or three different kinds of

00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:43.940
plastic within it.
 

00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:46.318
And what's going to happen to
this?

00:19:46.318 --> 00:19:48.009
Well certainly,
it's not going to be recycled.

00:19:48.009 --> 00:19:50.089
It's likely to be burned or
buried.

00:19:50.089 --> 00:19:53.630
Think about where you sleep.
 

00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:55.568
What is your mattress made out
of?

00:19:55.568 --> 00:19:59.000
Anybody here know exactly what
your mattress is made out of?

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:03.558
Well, it's a very difficult
thing to discover.

00:20:03.558 --> 00:20:06.917
Again, there's no requirement
to label the content of your

00:20:06.917 --> 00:20:08.450
mattress or your pillow.
 

00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:13.348
You get a broad description of
it, like polyester filled,

00:20:13.348 --> 00:20:17.635
polyurethane foam,
but you really don't know what

00:20:17.635 --> 00:20:22.368
the environmental fate of these
compounds might be.

00:20:22.368 --> 00:20:25.876
So what I'm doing is I'm
painting a picture for you here

00:20:25.876 --> 00:20:29.430
that we're all as innocent,
you're all as innocent as I am

00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:31.338
in thinking that,
well, somebody must have been

00:20:31.338 --> 00:20:32.118
paying attention to this.
 

00:20:32.118 --> 00:20:36.170
Nobody would really want us to
be lying with our noses within a

00:20:36.170 --> 00:20:40.220
half an inch of a surface where
we had no understanding of what

00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:42.049
the chemical content is.
 

00:20:42.049 --> 00:20:43.660
Think about toys.
 

00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:46.383
Ninety percent of the toys
produced in the world now,

00:20:46.383 --> 00:20:49.316
between eighty percent and
ninety percent are produced in

00:20:49.316 --> 00:20:49.838
China.
 

00:20:49.838 --> 00:20:52.920
And increasingly,
they are made out of plastic.

00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:56.904
You know, consider yourself to
be the executive of McDonald's

00:20:56.904 --> 00:21:00.890
and you're thinking about the
introduction of a new meal,

00:21:00.890 --> 00:21:05.946
a new supersized meal or maybe
an environmentally responsible

00:21:05.946 --> 00:21:07.380
downsized meal.
 

00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:08.680
What are you going to do?
 

00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:11.401
Well, one of the first things
you're going to do is you're

00:21:11.401 --> 00:21:14.170
going to try to contract out
with a toy manufacturer to try

00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:17.179
to figure out what the next toy
is going to be that you're going

00:21:17.179 --> 00:21:19.278
to give for free so all the
children,

00:21:19.278 --> 00:21:22.294
when they come to McDonald's,
will sit and play with the toy

00:21:22.294 --> 00:21:23.980
while they eat their hamburger.
 

00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:26.460
Well, what happens to those
toys?

00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:30.461
The overwhelming majority of
them get discarded within a week

00:21:30.461 --> 00:21:32.130
of when they're issued.
 

00:21:32.130 --> 00:21:35.250
And these also are not recycled.
 

00:21:35.250 --> 00:21:37.806
Think about your own
entertainment,

00:21:37.806 --> 00:21:39.308
what you purchase.
 

00:21:39.308 --> 00:21:42.181
And by the way,
all of these toys are wrapped

00:21:42.181 --> 00:21:44.269
in plastic of different forms.
 

00:21:44.269 --> 00:21:46.626
And think about the
polycarbonate CD disc,

00:21:46.626 --> 00:21:50.192
the number of CD discs that you
have lying around your house or

00:21:50.192 --> 00:21:52.318
your apartment or your dorm
room.

00:21:52.318 --> 00:21:55.380
And think about how you bought
it?

00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:58.130
Well, it came in a cover that
looked something like this.

00:21:58.130 --> 00:22:01.866
And it probably was also
wrapped in some other additional

00:22:01.866 --> 00:22:05.688
kind of a vinyl coating,
plastic coating on the outside

00:22:05.688 --> 00:22:09.390
that makes it actually difficult
to get the disc out,

00:22:09.390 --> 00:22:12.368
at least in the store in an
unobtrusive manner.

00:22:12.368 --> 00:22:15.588
So think about your iPhones,
think about your iPods,

00:22:15.588 --> 00:22:18.998
think about your computers,
think about your electronic

00:22:18.998 --> 00:22:19.630
world.
 

00:22:19.630 --> 00:22:22.048
I want to talk a little bit
more about food.

00:22:22.048 --> 00:22:24.032
Because food,
as it turns out,

00:22:24.032 --> 00:22:27.796
is now believed to be the
predominant source of chemical

00:22:27.796 --> 00:22:32.380
components in plastic that are
now measurable in human tissues.

00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:36.834
And I'd like you to think also
about the way that we store

00:22:36.834 --> 00:22:39.248
food,
the way that we buy food,

00:22:39.248 --> 00:22:43.538
the way that it's processed and
how it's packaged and sold.

00:22:43.538 --> 00:22:47.430
And it's done in very specific
ways to promote its freshness

00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:50.726
and to avoid food-borne
illnesses, and this is very

00:22:50.726 --> 00:22:51.650
important.
 

00:22:51.650 --> 00:22:56.156
But we haven't been thinking
ecologically about how to manage

00:22:56.156 --> 00:22:59.855
this problem,
because really no one has

00:22:59.855 --> 00:23:05.643
designed these products so that
the end of the life fate is

00:23:05.643 --> 00:23:07.640
being considered.
 

00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:13.046
Indeed, no producer really has
responsibility for disposal or

00:23:13.046 --> 00:23:16.200
the ultimate fate of the
product.

00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:19.240
Think also about your
electronic world with respect to

00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:19.930
computers.
 

00:23:19.930 --> 00:23:24.952
I became fascinated when I read
that a printer I was using had

00:23:24.952 --> 00:23:25.940
ink in it.
 

00:23:25.940 --> 00:23:27.625
And the ink,
I mean obviously,

00:23:27.625 --> 00:23:30.650
the printer is formed
predominately out of plastic or

00:23:30.650 --> 00:23:33.731
different kinds of plastics,
including the electronics

00:23:33.731 --> 00:23:34.430
board.
 

00:23:34.430 --> 00:23:38.640
But I didn't know that the ink
itself could have plastic in it.

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:40.730
Why would ink have plastic in
it?

00:23:40.730 --> 00:23:43.769
Well, it turns out that the
plastic in bisphenol-A has an

00:23:43.769 --> 00:23:47.190
effect on paper that it prevents
the ink from spreading into the

00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:49.470
fibers of the paper once it's
applied.

00:23:49.470 --> 00:23:55.335
This is apparently more common
with the inkjet printers or the

00:23:55.335 --> 00:24:01.200
heat-driven printers that you
get as a credit card receipt.

00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:07.348
Think also about bisphenol-A
and polycarbonates and the next

00:24:07.348 --> 00:24:12.038
generation of water bottles and
containers.

00:24:12.038 --> 00:24:17.780
So that many people have
recognized now that when infants

00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:22.532
are fed formula,
it's very common for a mom or a

00:24:22.532 --> 00:24:25.880
dad or whoever to fill up a
bottle,

00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:28.286
a plastic bottle,
either with hot water or to put

00:24:28.286 --> 00:24:29.390
it in the microwave.
 

00:24:29.390 --> 00:24:35.215
So that the idea that heating
of these products could energize

00:24:35.215 --> 00:24:41.232
the molecules and cause some of
them to migrate into the food or

00:24:41.232 --> 00:24:44.838
the liquid itself,
this was not tested.

00:24:44.838 --> 00:24:47.442
It was not required to be
tested in a sufficient way by

00:24:47.442 --> 00:24:49.130
the Food and Drug
Administration.

00:24:49.130 --> 00:24:51.614
Although the Food and Drug
Administration has the legal

00:24:51.614 --> 00:24:52.578
authority to do so.
 

00:24:52.578 --> 00:24:55.450
So what I'm doing is painting a
picture here that the

00:24:55.450 --> 00:24:58.540
Environmental Protection Agency
has the responsibility to

00:24:58.540 --> 00:25:01.078
implement the Toxic Substance
Control Act.

00:25:01.078 --> 00:25:03.578
They have not required prior
testing.

00:25:03.578 --> 00:25:08.019
They have not demanded that
hazardous components,

00:25:08.019 --> 00:25:11.267
those chemicals that are found
to adversely affect the health

00:25:11.267 --> 00:25:13.503
of other species,
that they be eliminated from

00:25:13.503 --> 00:25:14.038
the product.
 

00:25:14.038 --> 00:25:19.420
And there's no labeling
involved, either in the country

00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:25.200
of origin or in the chemical
composition of the product.

00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:28.618
So there's absolutely no way
that the consumer has to

00:25:28.618 --> 00:25:32.236
discriminate between a safe or
unsafe or environmentally

00:25:32.236 --> 00:25:33.880
responsible products.
 

00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:36.914
Also, I want you to think a
little bit more about what we

00:25:36.914 --> 00:25:37.618
drink from.
 

00:25:37.618 --> 00:25:42.311
And many of these containers
have some fibers,

00:25:42.311 --> 00:25:44.920
plant material in them.
 

00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:47.940
But they are often coated with
plastic as well.

00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:50.608
This is a typical grocery store.
 

00:25:50.608 --> 00:25:52.996
And the next time you walk into
a supermarket,

00:25:52.996 --> 00:25:54.798
I hope you walk down the
aisles.

00:25:54.798 --> 00:25:58.498
And I want you to pay special
attention and look particularly

00:25:58.498 --> 00:26:01.826
for products that are not
wrapped in plastic or they're

00:26:01.826 --> 00:26:04.230
not stored in plastic
environments.

00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:08.519
The same thing goes with
respect to Coke.

00:26:08.519 --> 00:26:11.950
I gave a lecture similar to
this several months ago.

00:26:11.950 --> 00:26:13.910
And I was struck.
 

00:26:13.910 --> 00:26:17.972
A gentleman came up after the
lecture, he was a very heavyset

00:26:17.972 --> 00:26:18.380
guy.
 

00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:21.505
And he said,
"I drink three to four

00:26:21.505 --> 00:26:24.150
liters of soda every day."
 

00:26:24.150 --> 00:26:26.960
And he said,
"From what you said,

00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:30.009
I'm worried about the plastic
chemicals migrating into the

00:26:30.009 --> 00:26:33.380
liquids and whether or not it's
building up in my body."

00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:35.291
I'm thinking,
oh, three to four liters of

00:26:35.291 --> 00:26:36.009
soda per day.
 

00:26:36.009 --> 00:26:39.578
That's not good with respect to
the sugar alone.

00:26:39.578 --> 00:26:42.648
And he said,
"Well, from what you've

00:26:42.648 --> 00:26:47.176
said, the internal lining of the
cans is lined with an epoxy

00:26:47.176 --> 00:26:50.400
resin that often contains
bisphenol-A.

00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:54.193
Now, should I choose to drink
Coke in cans or should I drink

00:26:54.193 --> 00:26:57.730
the Coke out of these liter
bottles that are made out of

00:26:57.730 --> 00:26:59.210
polyethylene."
 

00:26:59.210 --> 00:27:01.383
Well I said to him,
I thought for a couple of

00:27:01.383 --> 00:27:03.607
minutes and I said,
"Well, you know,

00:27:03.607 --> 00:27:06.319
I think I would avoid the cans
because at least the

00:27:06.319 --> 00:27:09.574
polyethylene does not have a
hormonally active compound in it

00:27:09.574 --> 00:27:10.930
such as bisphenol-A.
 

00:27:10.930 --> 00:27:13.710
Well he was not pleased about
the story.

00:27:13.710 --> 00:27:17.150
But it gives you some insight
into the way that the epoxy

00:27:17.150 --> 00:27:20.773
resins are being used in order
to prevent oxidization on the

00:27:20.773 --> 00:27:22.740
inside of all sorts of cans.
 

00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:25.538
Canned tomatoes,
think about your dining hall,

00:27:25.538 --> 00:27:27.318
any of you work in the dining
hall,

00:27:27.318 --> 00:27:32.208
think about the large cans that
they have their food delivered

00:27:32.208 --> 00:27:32.930
within.
 

00:27:32.930 --> 00:27:37.298
And all these are potential
sources of exposure.

00:27:37.298 --> 00:27:41.078
Think of the way that meats are
packaged, that are wrapped in

00:27:41.078 --> 00:27:44.480
vinyl that are sitting on
polystyrene, none of which is

00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:45.298
recycled.
 

00:27:45.298 --> 00:27:46.960
What happens when you get your
food home?

00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:48.650
Well, you bring it into a
refrigerator.

00:27:48.650 --> 00:27:49.680
And where do you store it?
 

00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:52.048
You store it inside plastic
bins.

00:27:52.048 --> 00:27:57.078
And my refrigerator looks quite
a bit like this.

00:27:57.078 --> 00:28:02.150
And what I am not showing you
here is the water supply.

00:28:02.150 --> 00:28:07.181
So that some refrigerators have
a little interior cut out in the

00:28:07.181 --> 00:28:11.893
front door where you push a
glass into it to get fresh water

00:28:11.893 --> 00:28:14.210
or it's an ice dispenser.
 

00:28:14.210 --> 00:28:18.664
So that tracing the origin of
the water to that will lead you

00:28:18.664 --> 00:28:21.635
to plastic tubing,
which is made out of a

00:28:21.635 --> 00:28:24.308
phthalate, could be bisphenol-A.
 

00:28:24.308 --> 00:28:26.530
What happens to all these
products once we get rid of

00:28:26.530 --> 00:28:26.828
them?
 

00:28:26.828 --> 00:28:29.936
Well, it's kind of ironic that
we take them out and we put them

00:28:29.936 --> 00:28:31.190
in a plastic trash bin.
 

00:28:31.190 --> 00:28:34.884
I just walked in past
Vanderbilt Hall and you all know

00:28:34.884 --> 00:28:35.858
the walkway.
 

00:28:35.858 --> 00:28:39.722
And there are about fifteen or
twenty different plastic garbage

00:28:39.722 --> 00:28:40.970
cans all lined up.
 

00:28:40.970 --> 00:28:42.680
What happens to those when they
crack?

00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:44.598
Where do they end up?
 

00:28:44.598 --> 00:28:49.316
Similarly, most will end up
either underground or they will

00:28:49.316 --> 00:28:51.349
end up in incinerators.
 

00:28:51.349 --> 00:28:53.000
Think about sports.
 

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:54.880
I was thinking about Lindsey
Vonn.

00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:58.682
And as I was skiing over
Christmas break,

00:28:58.682 --> 00:29:02.960
I thought about my own gear
that I have on.

00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:05.880
I had plastic skis on,
I had plastic boots on,

00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:08.180
I had a plastic polycarbonate
helmet on,

00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:11.240
I had plastic goggles on,
on top of my polycarbonate

00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:12.259
plastic lenses.
 

00:29:12.259 --> 00:29:16.576
I had a Gortex jacket on,
I had waterproof pants on that

00:29:16.576 --> 00:29:21.048
not only were synthetic and
formed at least in part out of

00:29:21.048 --> 00:29:23.961
plastic,
but they also had been applied

00:29:23.961 --> 00:29:27.618
with a waterproofing agent that
we talked about earlier,

00:29:27.618 --> 00:29:33.227
a compound that basically is
designed to prevent molecules

00:29:33.227 --> 00:29:35.490
from resting on them.
 

00:29:35.490 --> 00:29:37.913
So that they shed water,
they shed stains,

00:29:37.913 --> 00:29:39.568
stain-resistant chemicals.
 

00:29:39.568 --> 00:29:45.029
And also, I had underwear that
was long underwear that was made

00:29:45.029 --> 00:29:46.440
out of fleece.
 

00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:48.880
Fleece is polyethylene often.
 

00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:51.380
And fleece actually can be
recycled,

00:29:51.380 --> 00:29:53.940
so that some people claim,
such as Patagonia,

00:29:53.940 --> 00:29:56.000
that they use a certain
percentage of recycled

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.430
polyethylene when they make some
of their products.

00:29:58.430 --> 00:30:02.786
The poles themselves are made
often out of plastic,

00:30:02.786 --> 00:30:06.009
as are the handles and the
baskets.

00:30:06.009 --> 00:30:10.491
So that just about any sport
you can imagine is now dependent

00:30:10.491 --> 00:30:12.509
quite heavily on plastic.
 

00:30:12.509 --> 00:30:16.107
The sleds that they use,
the sled that won the Games the

00:30:16.107 --> 00:30:17.808
other night for the U.S.
 

00:30:17.808 --> 00:30:20.449
has an outer shell that would
be polycarbonate,

00:30:20.449 --> 00:30:23.490
so it would have reduced weight
but great strength.

00:30:23.490 --> 00:30:28.713
By the way, I really
appreciated plastic in my car

00:30:28.713 --> 00:30:31.058
about two years ago.
 

00:30:31.058 --> 00:30:34.417
I was driving down ninety-five
and I was rear ended by a maniac

00:30:34.417 --> 00:30:36.855
who was going about ninety-five
miles an hour,

00:30:36.855 --> 00:30:38.210
the police estimated.
 

00:30:38.210 --> 00:30:41.069
And I was doing about seventy
or seventy-five.

00:30:41.069 --> 00:30:45.559
But my car survived quite well.
 

00:30:45.559 --> 00:30:46.460
It's a Toyota.
 

00:30:46.460 --> 00:30:49.943
And the Toyota absorbed the
shock in the back and I

00:30:49.943 --> 00:30:54.057
fishtailed back and forth in the
passing lane and eventually

00:30:54.057 --> 00:30:55.730
brought my car over.
 

00:30:55.730 --> 00:30:59.063
I got out and looked at the
back and the back end was all

00:30:59.063 --> 00:31:00.670
banged up and smashed up.
 

00:31:00.670 --> 00:31:03.916
And that's when I realized,
boy, they really have a system

00:31:03.916 --> 00:31:07.049
down here with these collapsible
bumpers where they have

00:31:07.049 --> 00:31:10.637
different kinds of plastic that
are lined up that have different

00:31:10.637 --> 00:31:14.113
degrees of hardness in them to
basically distribute the energy

00:31:14.113 --> 00:31:15.308
from a crash.
 

00:31:15.308 --> 00:31:20.166
So the use of plastic compounds
for their lightness,

00:31:20.166 --> 00:31:24.643
for their energy conservation,
for their safety,

00:31:24.643 --> 00:31:29.118
it is clearly growing in public
acceptance.

00:31:29.118 --> 00:31:32.059
Think also about other
recreational equipment.

00:31:32.059 --> 00:31:34.380
Many of you may have a Camelbak.
 

00:31:34.380 --> 00:31:35.788
What's in a Camelbak anyway?
 

00:31:35.788 --> 00:31:39.636
Well, it's a plastic bladder
made from polyurethane,

00:31:39.636 --> 00:31:43.410
but it contains no bisphenol-A
or no phthalates.

00:31:43.410 --> 00:31:45.759
There is an antimicrobial
silver lining.

00:31:45.759 --> 00:31:48.913
So when people started
realizing that they didn't want

00:31:48.913 --> 00:31:51.839
to buy the sport bottles,
such as Nalgene because of

00:31:51.839 --> 00:31:54.013
bisphenol-A,
Camelbak was quite fortunate

00:31:54.013 --> 00:31:56.308
that they had chosen a different
material.

00:31:56.308 --> 00:31:59.335
And think about stainless steel
bottles, such as these Klean

00:31:59.335 --> 00:31:59.900
Kanteens.
 

00:31:59.900 --> 00:32:03.830
These are not lined with an
epoxy resin that contains

00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:04.890
bisphenol-A.
 

00:32:04.890 --> 00:32:09.308
And I told you the story about
my own well water.

00:32:09.308 --> 00:32:12.923
But this is a good example here
of a tank that also has a-- this

00:32:12.923 --> 00:32:14.130
is my water supply.
 

00:32:14.130 --> 00:32:18.400
A tank that has an epoxy resin
coating on the inside,

00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:20.170
and then over here on the
right-hand side,

00:32:20.170 --> 00:32:22.046
you can see that canister,
that water filter that I was

00:32:22.046 --> 00:32:23.019
describing to you earlier.
 

00:32:23.019 --> 00:32:27.940
Think about the Brita filter
system.

00:32:27.940 --> 00:32:34.685
Brita also is made out of a
plastic polycarbonate and also a

00:32:34.685 --> 00:32:35.828
styrene.
 

00:32:35.828 --> 00:32:40.450
And if you pay attention to the
Food,

00:32:40.450 --> 00:32:42.670
Drug and Cosmetic Act and the
Safe Drinking Water Act,

00:32:42.670 --> 00:32:45.217
you know that bottled water
curiously is under the

00:32:45.217 --> 00:32:47.920
jurisdiction of the Food and
Drug Administration,

00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:50.838
whereas EPA is responsible for
tap water.

00:32:50.838 --> 00:32:52.298
That really doesn't make a
whole lot of sense.

00:32:52.298 --> 00:32:55.306
There's a separate set of
compounds that one might expect

00:32:55.306 --> 00:32:58.976
in bottled water,
based upon the potential for

00:32:58.976 --> 00:33:04.170
the compounds to leach from the
plastic into the water.

00:33:04.170 --> 00:33:09.180
So overall, the plastic problem
is that it surrounds us,

00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:11.116
we live in it,
we eat from it,

00:33:11.116 --> 00:33:12.844
we drink it,
we play with it,

00:33:12.844 --> 00:33:14.430
we work with it,
we listen to it,

00:33:14.430 --> 00:33:16.480
we watch it, we cook in it.
 

00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:21.009
So where is this material going
in the environment?

00:33:21.009 --> 00:33:24.185
For one of the phthalates,
the DEHP I mentioned earlier,

00:33:24.185 --> 00:33:27.479
here's an example of mean
concentrations detectable now in

00:33:27.479 --> 00:33:28.750
the environmental.
 

00:33:28.750 --> 00:33:30.640
It's detectable in surface
water.

00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:32.740
It's detected in ground water.
 

00:33:32.740 --> 00:33:34.710
It's detected in drinking water.
 

00:33:34.710 --> 00:33:39.242
It's in sediments in the
bottoms of lakes as well as

00:33:39.242 --> 00:33:41.109
streams and rivers.
 

00:33:41.109 --> 00:33:43.130
It's found commonly in soils.
 

00:33:43.130 --> 00:33:45.730
It's found especially in soils
that are beneath landfills.

00:33:45.730 --> 00:33:48.440
So when we buried the plastic
material,

00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:52.358
nobody thought about how bad
the soil contamination might

00:33:52.358 --> 00:33:53.671
get,
how concentrated,

00:33:53.671 --> 00:33:56.376
and where it might migrate and
could it get down into the

00:33:56.376 --> 00:33:57.440
underlying aquifer.
 

00:33:57.440 --> 00:34:02.568
It's found in indoor air,
109 nanograms per cubic meter.

00:34:02.568 --> 00:34:05.355
It's found in outdoor air,
which to me is really quite

00:34:05.355 --> 00:34:06.038
surprising.
 

00:34:06.038 --> 00:34:08.612
Again, this is a function of
the sensitivity of the detection

00:34:08.612 --> 00:34:09.170
technology.
 

00:34:09.170 --> 00:34:12.329
But this is really quite a
comment on our neglect of

00:34:12.329 --> 00:34:15.800
chemicals and misunderstanding
their movement through the

00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:18.280
environment and their ultimate
fate.

00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:21.150
It's detectable inside in house
dust.

00:34:21.150 --> 00:34:22.699
It's detectable in waste water.
 

00:34:22.699 --> 00:34:24.260
That should be no surprise.
 

00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:25.768
And why would that be?
 

00:34:25.768 --> 00:34:29.016
Well, my gosh,
I mean, we're feeding ourselves

00:34:29.016 --> 00:34:32.840
with water that's coming in
pipes that are made out of

00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:35.543
plastics,
and then we're disposing of

00:34:35.543 --> 00:34:39.059
waste, the drainpipes themselves
are polyvinylchloride.

00:34:39.059 --> 00:34:43.090
So why wouldn't you find
residues in the waste water?

00:34:43.090 --> 00:34:47.018
And for me in one way this is
maybe the most disturbing,

00:34:47.018 --> 00:34:49.826
it's in the rainwater,
so that it's detectable in

00:34:49.826 --> 00:34:53.451
rainwater just the same way that
strontium-90 was detectable in

00:34:53.451 --> 00:34:54.268
rainwater.
 

00:34:54.268 --> 00:34:59.465
So here's a case where we've
got an industry that basically

00:34:59.465 --> 00:35:05.469
has a legal framework that most
of the other chemical companies,

00:35:05.469 --> 00:35:07.989
like tobacco,
pesticides, pharmaceutical

00:35:07.989 --> 00:35:11.179
companies,
I mean, they would kill to have

00:35:11.179 --> 00:35:15.349
a legal license such as is being
enjoyed by the plastics

00:35:15.349 --> 00:35:16.260
industry.
 

00:35:16.260 --> 00:35:21.570
This is an example of serious
failure,

00:35:21.570 --> 00:35:23.559
and it would be a really
interesting kind of a

00:35:23.559 --> 00:35:26.259
longer-term research project if
anybody's looking for a senior

00:35:26.259 --> 00:35:28.250
essay down the road to ask the
question,

00:35:28.250 --> 00:35:31.650
especially if you're interested
in political science,

00:35:31.650 --> 00:35:35.585
why wouldn't this industry be
more heavily regulated than it

00:35:35.585 --> 00:35:35.920
is?
 

00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:37.469
How did they escape control?
 

00:35:37.469 --> 00:35:39.710
How do they fly underneath the
radar screen?

00:35:39.710 --> 00:35:42.760
Again, I'm reminded of Dustin
Hoffman's film,

00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:47.197
The Graduate,
where a middle-aged guy walks

00:35:47.197 --> 00:35:52.268
up to Dustin Hoffman and pulls
him aside at a party where

00:35:52.268 --> 00:35:57.429
Mrs. Robinson is hovering
around in the background next to

00:35:57.429 --> 00:35:58.969
the pool.
 

00:35:58.969 --> 00:36:02.413
And he walks up and he says,
"I have one word for you,

00:36:02.413 --> 00:36:02.769
son.
 

00:36:02.769 --> 00:36:04.449
And it's plastics."
 

00:36:04.449 --> 00:36:06.800
Now this was back in the
mid-1960s.

00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:10.715
So that we've had this
explosion of an industry that's

00:36:10.715 --> 00:36:15.000
gotten into hundreds of
thousands of different products.

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.175
The chemicals,
plastic chemicals have gotten

00:36:17.175 --> 00:36:19.653
into the products,
they've made their way into our

00:36:19.653 --> 00:36:20.110
life.
 

00:36:20.110 --> 00:36:23.923
And most of us have recognized
what's plastic and generally

00:36:23.923 --> 00:36:24.780
what's not.
 

00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:27.266
But we really haven't thought
about what it might mean for

00:36:27.266 --> 00:36:29.230
either our health or
environmental quality.

00:36:29.230 --> 00:36:32.891
So I want to spend just a
couple of minutes having you

00:36:32.891 --> 00:36:36.690
think about the hormonal
question that's being raised by

00:36:36.690 --> 00:36:37.590
plastics.
 

00:36:37.590 --> 00:36:43.827
And this was first recognized
by Rachel Carson when she wrote

00:36:43.827 --> 00:36:47.570
Silent Spring back in
1962.

00:36:47.570 --> 00:36:50.780
And I've mentioned this on
occasions before,

00:36:50.780 --> 00:36:53.010
but not with respect to
hormonally active compounds,

00:36:53.010 --> 00:36:58.110
where she discovered along with
colleagues that exposure to a

00:36:58.110 --> 00:37:03.128
variety of pesticides that where
hormonally active prevented

00:37:03.128 --> 00:37:06.190
calcium metabolism in eggshells.
 

00:37:06.190 --> 00:37:10.362
So that it caused reproductive
failure in certain species,

00:37:10.362 --> 00:37:12.340
especially large raptors.
 

00:37:12.340 --> 00:37:16.362
Well that concept--that we need
to worry about reproductive

00:37:16.362 --> 00:37:19.000
effects of some of these
chemicals--

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:22.034
it really escaped much
attention on the part of

00:37:22.034 --> 00:37:26.059
government through the majority
of the '60s and 1970s and then

00:37:26.059 --> 00:37:26.719
1980s.
 

00:37:26.719 --> 00:37:29.119
And then in 1996,
Theo Colburn,

00:37:29.119 --> 00:37:33.518
who also is a wildlife
ecologist like Rachel Carson,

00:37:33.518 --> 00:37:36.347
wrote Our Stolen Future.
So if you're interested in this

00:37:36.347 --> 00:37:39.094
history,
I would encourage you to read

00:37:39.094 --> 00:37:43.585
Our Stolen Future. It's
written as kind of a mystery

00:37:43.585 --> 00:37:45.525
story,
a scientific detective story

00:37:45.525 --> 00:37:46.690
they say in their subtitle.
 

00:37:46.690 --> 00:37:50.048
But she wrote this with Diane
Dumanowski, a longtime reporter

00:37:50.048 --> 00:37:52.568
with the Boston Globe,
and John Meyers,

00:37:52.568 --> 00:37:54.639
who also is a wildlife
ecologist.

00:37:54.639 --> 00:37:59.262
If you want to follow this in
more detail, I recommend Ted

00:37:59.262 --> 00:38:03.965
Shettler's and Gina Solomon's
book called Generations at

00:38:03.965 --> 00:38:05.018
Risk.
 

00:38:05.018 --> 00:38:08.773
So thinking about how our
fertility might be affected by

00:38:08.773 --> 00:38:11.436
these chemicals,
that we're experiencing

00:38:11.436 --> 00:38:15.260
mixtures without our knowledge,
without our consent.

00:38:15.260 --> 00:38:18.980
This is really the subject of
most of these books.

00:38:18.980 --> 00:38:22.097
So I want to look more
carefully at one of these

00:38:22.097 --> 00:38:23.878
compounds,
bisphenol-A,

00:38:23.878 --> 00:38:27.940
because it's one that I think
almost everybody now has

00:38:27.940 --> 00:38:31.389
detectable levels of BPA in
their tissues.

00:38:31.389 --> 00:38:34.110
And it's now recognized to
leach from containers.

00:38:34.110 --> 00:38:36.369
It's in soils and surface water
and fish.

00:38:36.369 --> 00:38:40.289
And it's highest in kids aged
one to six.

00:38:40.289 --> 00:38:42.340
Now that's really pretty
curious.

00:38:42.340 --> 00:38:45.780
Why would it be highest in kids
ages one to six?

00:38:45.780 --> 00:38:50.275
Experts inside EPA and FDA now
believe that food and beverages

00:38:50.275 --> 00:38:53.150
are the dominant sources of
exposure.

00:38:53.150 --> 00:38:56.844
By the way, there is yet no
good answer to the question why

00:38:56.844 --> 00:38:59.139
the kids are more heavily
exposed.

00:38:59.139 --> 00:39:02.974
The effects in animals include
female reproductive tract

00:39:02.974 --> 00:39:07.500
abnormalities,
including abnormalities in the

00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:13.847
ovary and abnormalities of the
reproductive tract in older

00:39:13.847 --> 00:39:20.639
female mice and changed vaginal
morphology among post-pubertal

00:39:20.639 --> 00:39:22.309
offspring.
 

00:39:22.309 --> 00:39:26.182
And it also influences the male
reproductive system in different

00:39:26.182 --> 00:39:27.983
species,
including reduced sperm

00:39:27.983 --> 00:39:31.340
production,
reduced mice testes weight and

00:39:31.340 --> 00:39:34.059
enhanced anogenital distance.
 

00:39:34.059 --> 00:39:39.512
It also has been shown to
induce mammary gland development

00:39:39.512 --> 00:39:40.469
in mice.
 

00:39:40.469 --> 00:39:43.539
So thinking about this chemical
and thinking about the different

00:39:43.539 --> 00:39:46.561
decision making standards that
exist in different environmental

00:39:46.561 --> 00:39:50.385
laws that we've got,
I'm curious about this in that

00:39:50.385 --> 00:39:54.380
in bisphenol-A were being sold
as a biocide,

00:39:54.380 --> 00:39:57.378
as a pesticide,
the EPA could not possibly

00:39:57.378 --> 00:39:59.719
license this chemical for use.
 

00:39:59.719 --> 00:40:03.063
The persistence of the
chemical, its environmental

00:40:03.063 --> 00:40:04.969
fate,
its threat to health as

00:40:04.969 --> 00:40:08.750
evidenced by these studies would
be significant enough to prevent

00:40:08.750 --> 00:40:10.110
that from happening.
 

00:40:10.110 --> 00:40:13.777
It's also been associated more
recently with insulin

00:40:13.777 --> 00:40:17.159
resistance, raising questions
about diabetes.

00:40:17.159 --> 00:40:20.487
And also, there is some
evidence of impaired immune

00:40:20.487 --> 00:40:21.219
function.
 

00:40:21.219 --> 00:40:24.355
Now think about the fact that
we're all being exposed to

00:40:24.355 --> 00:40:27.431
hormonally active chemicals and
mixtures without really

00:40:27.431 --> 00:40:28.630
understanding it.
 

00:40:28.630 --> 00:40:32.190
We don't really know what the
intensity of our exposure is.

00:40:32.190 --> 00:40:36.068
So what are we seeing out there
in terms of fertility or

00:40:36.068 --> 00:40:38.679
diseases of reproduction in
humans?

00:40:38.679 --> 00:40:42.110
Well, we're seeing a rise in
the prevalence of infertility,

00:40:42.110 --> 00:40:44.889
a serious rise over the past
several decades.

00:40:44.889 --> 00:40:51.320
And we're also seeing a rise in
some negative effects in humans,

00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:55.230
in males, particularly in young
males,

00:40:55.230 --> 00:41:00.394
increase in hypospadias,
which means that the opening of

00:41:00.394 --> 00:41:05.280
the penis does not occur at the
end of the penis,

00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:06.539
it occurs further up the shaft.
 

00:41:06.539 --> 00:41:10.789
And also cryptorchidism,
which means that little kids

00:41:10.789 --> 00:41:15.449
don't have fully descended
testicles when they're born.

00:41:15.449 --> 00:41:19.074
So that there are a variety of
different reproductive problems

00:41:19.074 --> 00:41:22.880
occurring in the population at
higher incidence than formerly.

00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:26.407
Well, it's curious when a
debate like this occurs,

00:41:26.407 --> 00:41:29.719
when a product is out there on
the marketplace,

00:41:29.719 --> 00:41:33.320
it's treated globally,
what do we do about it?

00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:36.416
Well, the government,
the regulatory agencies tend to

00:41:36.416 --> 00:41:38.920
call in experts and get expert
opinions.

00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:44.409
So the National Institute for
Environmental Health Sciences,

00:41:44.409 --> 00:41:48.688
NIEHS, convened a panel,
it turned out the panel was put

00:41:48.688 --> 00:41:53.512
together and some of the reading
materials were put together by

00:41:53.512 --> 00:41:58.103
some representatives of the
industry itself so that many had

00:41:58.103 --> 00:42:02.925
a view that this was not really
an independent analysis of what

00:42:02.925 --> 00:42:06.349
the effects of bisphenol-A might
be.

00:42:06.349 --> 00:42:09.289
And they concluded with a
phrase "That there is some

00:42:09.289 --> 00:42:12.230
concern that exposure to
bisphenol-A causes some of these

00:42:12.230 --> 00:42:13.909
reproductive problems."
 

00:42:13.909 --> 00:42:17.875
A second panel was convened of
independent scientists that had

00:42:17.875 --> 00:42:21.579
no connections to the plastics
industry or the bisphenol-A

00:42:21.579 --> 00:42:22.880
industry at all.
 

00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:25.250
And they concluded something
quite different.

00:42:25.250 --> 00:42:28.293
"The wide range of adverse
effects of low doses of BPA in

00:42:28.293 --> 00:42:31.438
laboratory animals exposed both
during development and adulthood

00:42:31.438 --> 00:42:34.184
is a source for concern with
regard to the potential for

00:42:34.184 --> 00:42:36.480
similar adverse effects in
humans."

00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:40.989
So that this idea that you take
a question of science and you

00:42:40.989 --> 00:42:45.425
raise it in front of a group of
experts really forces one to

00:42:45.425 --> 00:42:49.934
think carefully about what the
conflicts of interest might be

00:42:49.934 --> 00:42:51.739
for those experts.
 

00:42:51.739 --> 00:42:54.773
How could you put together a
committee that clearly was

00:42:54.773 --> 00:42:55.559
independent?
 

00:42:55.559 --> 00:42:57.880
Well, full disclosure is one
way of doing that.

00:42:57.880 --> 00:43:01.617
So that demanding the people
disclose their income tax

00:43:01.617 --> 00:43:05.639
records or disclose their
affiliations or their consulting

00:43:05.639 --> 00:43:09.800
relationships with different
industries could clarify in the

00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:14.032
public's mind whether or not
there is a high probability of a

00:43:14.032 --> 00:43:14.949
bias.
 

00:43:14.949 --> 00:43:17.965
Well, remember what I said
about bisphenol-A being the

00:43:17.965 --> 00:43:19.556
hardener,
the phthalate,

00:43:19.556 --> 00:43:22.666
DEHP is a softener,
it's produced in a much lower

00:43:22.666 --> 00:43:25.530
volume,
260 million pounds per year.

00:43:25.530 --> 00:43:27.179
It's also found in our bodies.
 

00:43:27.179 --> 00:43:29.030
It's added to PVC plastic.
 

00:43:29.030 --> 00:43:33.829
And its recycling percentage is
close to zero.

00:43:33.829 --> 00:43:36.619
And it also is widely found in
the environment.

00:43:36.619 --> 00:43:41.347
And it's been found with
similar kinds of adverse effects

00:43:41.347 --> 00:43:45.483
in males, in test animals,
including reduced sperm

00:43:45.483 --> 00:43:49.030
production and early onset of
puberty.

00:43:49.030 --> 00:43:53.224
And all of this exposure is
coming predominately because of

00:43:53.224 --> 00:43:56.768
the failure of the Toxic
Substance Control Act.

00:43:56.768 --> 00:44:00.092
So Congress really recognized
that we needed to test these

00:44:00.092 --> 00:44:03.766
chemicals before they made their
way into the market back in the

00:44:03.766 --> 00:44:04.699
early 1970s.
 

00:44:04.699 --> 00:44:08.980
So they passed TSCA and gave
the authority to EPA to demand

00:44:08.980 --> 00:44:10.530
pre-market testing.
 

00:44:10.530 --> 00:44:12.929
But they didn't do anything
about it.

00:44:12.929 --> 00:44:15.764
So again, the universe of
chemicals is big,

00:44:15.764 --> 00:44:19.141
82,000 chemicals traded in
commerce, they have some

00:44:19.141 --> 00:44:20.559
commercial value.
 

00:44:20.559 --> 00:44:23.630
About 20,000 of those were
added since 1986.

00:44:23.630 --> 00:44:26.010
And what that means is that
this statute,

00:44:26.010 --> 00:44:28.791
the way it's worded,
it granted exemptions as

00:44:28.791 --> 00:44:31.826
chemicals that were
grandfathered or protected in

00:44:31.826 --> 00:44:35.365
the marketplace that couldn't be
removed by EPA to 62,000

00:44:35.365 --> 00:44:37.010
different compounds.
 

00:44:37.010 --> 00:44:41.155
The statute is unusual also
because it places a high burden

00:44:41.155 --> 00:44:45.588
on EPA to demonstrate that there
is a significant danger before

00:44:45.588 --> 00:44:50.380
it can demand from the industry
that they produce the evidence.

00:44:50.380 --> 00:44:53.806
Now, just pharmaceuticals and
like pesticides and other

00:44:53.806 --> 00:44:56.090
products that we've talked
about,

00:44:56.090 --> 00:44:59.469
how much sense does it make to
have the industry producing the

00:44:59.469 --> 00:45:02.349
data themselves and then
presenting their case to the

00:45:02.349 --> 00:45:05.119
Environmental Protection Agency
for licensing?

00:45:05.119 --> 00:45:07.260
Where should this occur?
 

00:45:07.260 --> 00:45:10.760
Should there be some sort of an
independent organization set up

00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:13.639
that would be more protected
from potential bias?

00:45:13.639 --> 00:45:16.052
Well clearly,
there's an economic stake

00:45:16.052 --> 00:45:19.610
involved, and industry is
anxious to spend that money.

00:45:19.610 --> 00:45:22.538
But this high burden on EPA to
demonstrate danger is the

00:45:22.538 --> 00:45:25.733
primary reason for the failure
of the Toxic Substance Control

00:45:25.733 --> 00:45:26.159
Act.
 

00:45:26.159 --> 00:45:30.766
So that over this period of
time, they have demanded testing

00:45:30.766 --> 00:45:33.500
for only 200 different
chemicals.

00:45:33.500 --> 00:45:37.010
And out of those 200,
only five have been prohibited.

00:45:37.010 --> 00:45:40.851
So what are states and other
governmental agencies doing

00:45:40.851 --> 00:45:41.760
about this?
 

00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:44.920
Well, a variety of state
initiatives, including here in

00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:46.909
Connecticut, have been launched.
 

00:45:46.909 --> 00:45:49.572
And a number of us have been
involved in drafting legislation

00:45:49.572 --> 00:45:50.550
in different states.
 

00:45:50.550 --> 00:45:54.483
But here in Connecticut,
we now have a statute on the

00:45:54.483 --> 00:45:58.568
books as of last year that
requires that bisphenol-A be

00:45:58.568 --> 00:46:02.954
taken out of products that are
intended to be used by young

00:46:02.954 --> 00:46:04.090
children.
 

00:46:04.090 --> 00:46:07.989
And similar statutes have been
passed in these other states.

00:46:07.989 --> 00:46:12.500
You can think about regulatory
policy being of testing a

00:46:12.500 --> 00:46:17.666
chemical, figuring how dangerous
it is and then figuring out how

00:46:17.666 --> 00:46:19.800
you might regulate it.
 

00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:21.500
Or you might just say,
here's a clear threshold.

00:46:21.500 --> 00:46:25.719
If a chemical behaves in this
way, say it's persistent,

00:46:25.719 --> 00:46:28.139
it's bioaccumulative,
it's found in human tissues,

00:46:28.139 --> 00:46:31.159
and it's demonstrated to be
hormonally active,

00:46:31.159 --> 00:46:32.690
that that's it.
 

00:46:32.690 --> 00:46:33.880
It's out of the marketplace.
 

00:46:33.880 --> 00:46:35.320
That's a prohibitive policy.
 

00:46:35.320 --> 00:46:38.960
So once you decide not to
employ a prohibitive policy,

00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:43.177
once you decide not to ban,
you basically require the

00:46:43.177 --> 00:46:47.882
regulatory agency to figure out
exactly which uses would be

00:46:47.882 --> 00:46:50.480
allowed and which would not.
 

00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:53.110
And it creates a very expensive
and difficult,

00:46:53.110 --> 00:46:56.326
time consuming monitoring and
enforcement problem for an

00:46:56.326 --> 00:46:56.969
agency.
 

00:46:56.969 --> 00:47:01.402
So the regulation--chemical by
chemical, use by use--is not

00:47:01.402 --> 00:47:06.219
likely to have much effect in
solving a problem such as this.

00:47:06.219 --> 00:47:10.771
California is requiring a
listing of DEHP under its

00:47:10.771 --> 00:47:12.320
Proposition 65.
 

00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:15.659
And this was required in 2008.
 

00:47:15.659 --> 00:47:20.427
And what it's done is,
it's limited the concentration

00:47:20.427 --> 00:47:24.829
of DEHP in products to less than
0.01 percent.

00:47:24.829 --> 00:47:26.250
Now what would that do?
 

00:47:26.250 --> 00:47:30.985
You're going to limit the
concentration of a chemical in a

00:47:30.985 --> 00:47:33.230
product to 0.012 percent.
 

00:47:33.230 --> 00:47:35.960
It's going to force the
government into becoming a

00:47:35.960 --> 00:47:37.409
monitoring organization.
 

00:47:37.409 --> 00:47:40.862
So it's got to go out and it's
got to test in order to find

00:47:40.862 --> 00:47:42.650
products that do not comply.
 

00:47:42.650 --> 00:47:44.940
Again, very expensive,
and a strategy that's not

00:47:44.940 --> 00:47:45.768
likely to work.
 

00:47:45.768 --> 00:47:48.668
Now, the European Union is
taking a very different

00:47:48.668 --> 00:47:49.320
approach.
 

00:47:49.320 --> 00:47:55.550
They have adopted a law in 2006
known as REACH.

00:47:55.550 --> 00:47:59.251
And REACH requires toxicity and
environmental fate testing for

00:47:59.251 --> 00:48:01.739
1,500 of the highest volume
chemicals,

00:48:01.739 --> 00:48:07.963
the highest amount produced
among the 80,000 chemicals that

00:48:07.963 --> 00:48:12.150
are out there that are poorly
tested.

00:48:12.150 --> 00:48:16.150
It's also a program that's been
delayed.

00:48:16.150 --> 00:48:21.829
The endocrine screening program
will not begin until 2012.

00:48:21.829 --> 00:48:23.630
The mixture problem remains.
 

00:48:23.630 --> 00:48:27.201
They still are not going to
tackle the issue that we're

00:48:27.201 --> 00:48:31.170
exposed in mixtures that might
act via the same mechanism.

00:48:31.170 --> 00:48:33.550
And also, they will be
grandfathering many of the

00:48:33.550 --> 00:48:36.329
chemicals that are produced in
the smaller quantities.

00:48:36.329 --> 00:48:40.402
But why would it not make sense
to focus exclusively on the

00:48:40.402 --> 00:48:42.860
high-production volume
chemicals?

00:48:42.860 --> 00:48:46.096
Well, you've got to think about
the fact that there could be

00:48:46.096 --> 00:48:49.003
some chemicals that are
extremely potent and extremely

00:48:49.003 --> 00:48:50.760
dangerous at very low doses.
 

00:48:50.760 --> 00:48:53.909
So plutonium again is a good
example of that.

00:48:53.909 --> 00:48:56.246
Also, corporations are acting
on their own,

00:48:56.246 --> 00:48:59.695
so that PVC corporate phase-out
policies have been adopted by a

00:48:59.695 --> 00:49:01.809
variety of firms,
including these.

00:49:01.809 --> 00:49:04.400
And this is having a very
significant effect.

00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:06.159
Number one, it's educating a
lot of people.

00:49:06.159 --> 00:49:09.449
When they see a label that says
PVC free or BPA free,

00:49:09.449 --> 00:49:12.297
they start to pay attention and
ask questions,

00:49:12.297 --> 00:49:13.690
why that might be.
 

00:49:13.690 --> 00:49:17.451
And I want you to back up and I
want you to think about really

00:49:17.451 --> 00:49:19.610
what the core of this problem
is.

00:49:19.610 --> 00:49:24.159
It really is consumerism,
the fact that we buy much more

00:49:24.159 --> 00:49:25.400
than we need.
 

00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:28.987
We don't pay attention in a way
to the ingredients of different

00:49:28.987 --> 00:49:31.650
products that we bring into our
environment.

00:49:31.650 --> 00:49:35.512
It also has to do with the
ignorance of our effects of our

00:49:35.512 --> 00:49:36.530
own behavior.
 

00:49:36.530 --> 00:49:39.643
When I was preparing this
lecture over the past couple of

00:49:39.643 --> 00:49:42.980
days, I have to admit that I got
really angry with myself.

00:49:42.980 --> 00:49:46.068
I got angry and I got
surprised, because I think of

00:49:46.068 --> 00:49:49.219
myself as somebody that should
have known better.

00:49:49.219 --> 00:49:53.029
I should have adjusted my
lifestyle to what I recognize as

00:49:53.029 --> 00:49:56.833
a potential threat,
not just to the environment,

00:49:56.833 --> 00:50:01.610
not just to the population,
but to my own kids.

00:50:01.610 --> 00:50:05.181
So there are many reasons for
that that don't have to do with

00:50:05.181 --> 00:50:05.480
me.
 

00:50:05.480 --> 00:50:08.559
But I should have known better
than that.

00:50:08.559 --> 00:50:12.128
And hopefully after taking this
course, you will not make this

00:50:12.128 --> 00:50:13.710
kind of problem yourself.
 

00:50:13.710 --> 00:50:18.219
You can think about national
regulation as a partial solution

00:50:18.219 --> 00:50:20.699
because the markets are global.
 

00:50:20.699 --> 00:50:23.885
People are trading these
products and chemicals across

00:50:23.885 --> 00:50:25.809
national borders all the time.
 

00:50:25.809 --> 00:50:28.307
So what does it mean if the
United States passes a law,

00:50:28.307 --> 00:50:30.159
but say Germany does not pass
the law?

00:50:30.159 --> 00:50:33.029
Or Germany's got a more
restrictive statute than the

00:50:33.029 --> 00:50:33.929
United States?
 

00:50:33.929 --> 00:50:37.208
That's a recipe for trade
barriers that are likely to be

00:50:37.208 --> 00:50:38.579
eventually litigated.
 

00:50:38.579 --> 00:50:43.739
So think also about the
concentration and dispersion of

00:50:43.739 --> 00:50:49.474
products and the effect of one
corporation like McDonald's or

00:50:49.474 --> 00:50:54.920
say Toyota to make a choice that
they are going to not use

00:50:54.920 --> 00:50:57.119
certain products.
 

00:50:57.119 --> 00:50:59.728
That they're not going to
distribute a billion new toys

00:50:59.728 --> 00:51:02.289
over the next two years with
their new market line.

00:51:02.289 --> 00:51:07.585
Or that they're going to demand
ultimate accountability for the

00:51:07.585 --> 00:51:11.768
eventual fate or end of life of
their product,

00:51:11.768 --> 00:51:14.481
the way that some of the
printer companies have that have

00:51:14.481 --> 00:51:16.981
demanded the recycling,
or not demanded,

00:51:16.981 --> 00:51:21.331
but offered to take back the
ink cartridges once they are

00:51:21.331 --> 00:51:22.030
empty.
 

00:51:22.030 --> 00:51:25.195
So basically,
the government has been

00:51:25.195 --> 00:51:30.119
neglecting externalities and
there has been an absence of

00:51:30.119 --> 00:51:31.789
accountability.
 

00:51:31.789 --> 00:51:34.760
So here is a list of potential
solutions.

00:51:34.760 --> 00:51:36.409
And I know we're out of time.
 

00:51:36.409 --> 00:51:37.619
Go through these.
 

00:51:37.619 --> 00:51:39.679
These will be up on the website
later this afternoon.

00:51:39.679 --> 00:51:42.965
So I'm going to conclude there
and just remind you that the

00:51:42.965 --> 00:51:46.083
electronic exam will be emailed
out to you today at five

00:51:46.083 --> 00:51:48.282
o'clock,
that you have forty-eight hours

00:51:48.282 --> 00:51:50.697
to return it,
and return it both to the

00:51:50.697 --> 00:51:54.137
Classes*v2 server drop box,
but also please return it to

00:51:54.137 --> 00:51:55.489
your teaching assistants.
 

00:51:55.489 --> 00:51:57.349
Thanks very much, and good luck.
 

00:51:57.349 --> 00:51:59.358
And I probably won't see many
of you before break,

00:51:59.358 --> 00:52:01.079
so I hope you have a really
great break.

00:52:01.079 --> 00:52:07.000

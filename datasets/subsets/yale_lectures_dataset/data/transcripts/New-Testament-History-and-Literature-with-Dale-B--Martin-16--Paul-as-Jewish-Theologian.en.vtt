00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.395
Prof: Paul founded
several, probably small,

00:00:07.395 --> 00:00:11.620
house churches in the area of
Galatia.

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:14.075
There's some debate about
exactly what part of Asia Minor

00:00:14.075 --> 00:00:16.706
he's referring to because there
are different parts that were

00:00:16.706 --> 00:00:17.540
called Galatia.
 

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:19.267
Of course the word
"Galatia"

00:00:19.267 --> 00:00:21.602
you recognize probably just
comes from the word for

00:00:21.602 --> 00:00:25.311
"Gaul",
that is the people who occupied

00:00:25.311 --> 00:00:27.579
France,
later the Gauls were tribes

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:30.778
that tended to be in different
parts of Europe at different

00:00:30.778 --> 00:00:32.656
times,
so there's part of Asia Minor,

00:00:32.656 --> 00:00:34.166
that is,
modern day Turkey,

00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:37.960
the central part of it that was
called Galatia after the Gauls.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.389
Paul was there at some point,
we don't know exactly when,

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:43.410
he founded some churches there.
 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.256
These were all Gentile
churches, there's no record at

00:00:47.256 --> 00:00:51.990
all that he had any contact in
the area with Jews themselves,

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:56.262
and there is no record in the
letter to the Galatians that

00:00:56.262 --> 00:00:59.560
he's addressing Jews at all in
the letter.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:04.420
If you notice from the letter,
also, it's not directed simply

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.578
to one house church or even one
town.

00:01:07.578 --> 00:01:10.700
Galatia refers to an area that
included different towns,

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.144
and so this is something like a
circular letter that would have

00:01:14.144 --> 00:01:15.980
gone around to different parts.
 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:20.257
Other traveling teachers
obviously have come along at

00:01:20.257 --> 00:01:23.349
some point,
and quite reasonable enough,

00:01:23.349 --> 00:01:27.439
they may themselves be Jewish
followers of Jesus or they may

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:31.599
be Gentiles themselves but who
became law observant when they

00:01:31.599 --> 00:01:33.610
started following Jesus.
 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:34.860
This would be natural.
 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.415
I mean if you come along and
say, well you're now worshipping

00:01:37.415 --> 00:01:40.152
the God of Israel,
now you're sort of claiming to

00:01:40.152 --> 00:01:42.950
be followers of Abraham,
you're claiming to be children

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.822
of Abraham,
you're claiming to be followers

00:01:44.822 --> 00:01:45.739
of a Jewish Messiah.
 

00:01:45.739 --> 00:01:48.060
Well, it's okay that you're
followers and its okay that you

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.953
were baptized,
but if you really want to be a

00:01:50.953 --> 00:01:55.232
full citizen in this group you
need to get circumcised like

00:01:55.232 --> 00:01:57.959
other Jews do,
you need to keep kosher;

00:01:57.959 --> 00:01:59.390
you need to follow the Jewish
law.

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.890
The Jewish ethnic laws are
written for Jews;

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.774
they're still enforced,
and if you want to be a part of

00:02:04.774 --> 00:02:07.391
the people of Israel and follow
the God of Israel,

00:02:07.391 --> 00:02:08.938
then keep the Jewish law.
 

00:02:08.938 --> 00:02:13.729
A perfectly natural idea,
but it sends Paul way over the

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:14.340
edge.
 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.919
He writes Galatians to this
group trying to convince them

00:02:18.919 --> 00:02:22.281
not to accept this,
what he calls a new teaching or

00:02:22.281 --> 00:02:25.474
a different Gospel,
and this is where Paul is in

00:02:25.474 --> 00:02:29.516
his most angry and most
vituperative of just about all

00:02:29.516 --> 00:02:30.889
of his letters.
 

00:02:30.889 --> 00:02:33.696
We're going to go through
several parts of it because what

00:02:33.696 --> 00:02:36.846
I'm going to point out right now
is, how did Paul try to convince

00:02:36.846 --> 00:02:37.288
them?
 

00:02:37.288 --> 00:02:41.372
Look at Galatians with me,
we're going to skip around in

00:02:41.372 --> 00:02:42.560
several parts.
 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.083
Galatians 2:15,
the first two chapters you've

00:02:46.083 --> 00:02:50.807
already read because we read it
at the very beginning of the

00:02:50.807 --> 00:02:53.621
semester,
this is when Paul tells the

00:02:53.621 --> 00:02:55.940
story of where he was in
Jerusalem,

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.710
where he was in Damascus,
how he got his own Gospel.

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:02.244
He emphasizes his independence
from the leadership of the

00:03:02.244 --> 00:03:04.371
churches in Judea,
Peter, James,

00:03:04.371 --> 00:03:08.069
John, precisely because it may
well have been that the people

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:11.893
who came to Galatia after he did
and were teaching these people

00:03:11.893 --> 00:03:14.312
otherwise,
they might have said,

00:03:14.312 --> 00:03:16.801
well Paul, sure,
he told you some of the Gospel,

00:03:16.801 --> 00:03:18.919
but Paul's not really one of
the original Apostles.

00:03:18.919 --> 00:03:21.046
The original Apostles are
Peter, and James,

00:03:21.046 --> 00:03:23.530
and John, and we represent
their point of view.

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.796
Paul initially separates
himself from that at all and

00:03:26.796 --> 00:03:28.566
says,
I didn't get my Gospel from

00:03:28.566 --> 00:03:32.022
Peter, James,
and John, they are not the core

00:03:32.022 --> 00:03:34.262
Apostles,
I am just as much an Apostle as

00:03:34.262 --> 00:03:36.432
they are,
I got my Gospel straight from

00:03:36.432 --> 00:03:36.848
Jesus.
 

00:03:36.848 --> 00:03:39.858
Then he goes on to talk about
the law 2:15,

00:03:39.858 --> 00:03:43.509
"We ourselves are Jews by
birth and not Gentile

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:44.800
sinners."
 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.349
"Gentile sinners"
was just like two words that

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:49.992
almost automatically went
together in some Jewish rhetoric

00:03:49.992 --> 00:03:51.568
and propaganda in this period.
 

00:03:51.568 --> 00:03:55.252
Being outside of Israel,
being outside of the people of

00:03:55.252 --> 00:03:58.460
God made you a sinner
practically in itself,

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:00.218
at least according to some
points of view,

00:04:00.218 --> 00:04:03.852
and Paul tends to share that
point of view because he uses

00:04:03.852 --> 00:04:07.229
"Gentile sinners"
himself more than once.

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:10.000
Yet we know that a person is
justified not by works of law

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.750
but through faith in Jesus
Christ.

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.167
We have come to believe in
Jesus Christ so that we might be

00:04:14.167 --> 00:04:16.709
justified by faith in Christ and
not by doing the works of the

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:19.002
law because no one will be
justified by the works of the

00:04:19.002 --> 00:04:19.420
law.
 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:21.848
But if in our effort to be
justified in Christ we ourselves

00:04:21.848 --> 00:04:24.235
have been found to be sinners,
is Christ then a servant of

00:04:24.235 --> 00:04:24.569
sin?
 

00:04:24.569 --> 00:04:25.569
Certainly not!
 

00:04:25.569 --> 00:04:27.940
But if I build up again the
very things that I once tore

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.139
down, then I demonstrate that
I'm a transgressor.

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:34.067
For through the law I died to
the law so that I might live to

00:04:34.067 --> 00:04:34.459
God.
 

00:04:34.459 --> 00:04:35.850
I have been crucified with
Christ.

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:39.480
It is no longer I who live but
it is Christ who lives in me.

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:42.526
The life I now live in the
flesh I live by faith in the Son

00:04:42.526 --> 00:04:43.000
of God.
 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.889
For if justification comes
through the law then Christ died

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:49.230
for nothing
That's a pretty big statement.

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:53.766
If the law gets you anywhere,
then Christ didn't need to die

00:04:53.766 --> 00:04:54.459
at all.
 

00:04:54.459 --> 00:04:59.769
Notice what he says in 3:12,
he gets even worse with what he

00:04:59.769 --> 00:05:02.386
says--3:12:
The law does not rest on faith,

00:05:02.386 --> 00:05:04.355
on the contrary,
whoever does the works of the

00:05:04.355 --> 00:05:05.449
law will live by them.
 

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:08.488
Notice he's separating out
faith and law,

00:05:08.488 --> 00:05:12.439
that's not something that
almost any Jew would do.

00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:17.240
The idea that somehow you don't
have faith in God because you

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:20.839
keep kosher is ridiculous to a
lot of Jews.

00:05:20.839 --> 00:05:24.086
In fact you're keeping kosher,
you're keeping the law is an

00:05:24.086 --> 00:05:25.990
expression of your faith in God.
 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:29.235
And so Paul's saying this,
it might sound almost

00:05:29.235 --> 00:05:33.449
commonsensical if you've been
raised in a Christian church.

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:36.166
But if you put yourself in the
mind of a Jew of the first

00:05:36.166 --> 00:05:37.351
century,
hearing this,

00:05:37.351 --> 00:05:40.360
that somehow the law and faith
are opposed to one another,

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.089
is just very shocking.
 

00:05:42.089 --> 00:05:46.081
Look at 3:15:
Brothers I give an example from

00:05:46.081 --> 00:05:51.038
daily life, once a person's will
has been ratified no one adds to

00:05:51.038 --> 00:05:52.509
it or annuls it.
 

00:05:52.509 --> 00:05:55.199
The promises were made to
Abraham and to his offspring.

00:05:55.199 --> 00:05:57.579
It does not say "and to
offsprings."

00:05:57.579 --> 00:06:00.014
And what he's doing is he's
playing on the Greek word

00:06:00.014 --> 00:06:02.122
"seed"
is what is translated here as

00:06:02.122 --> 00:06:03.338
"offspring."
 

00:06:03.338 --> 00:06:06.278
He's saying this was given to
Abraham's seed and the Greek

00:06:06.278 --> 00:06:08.206
word is singular,
"seed,"

00:06:08.206 --> 00:06:09.896
it doesn't say
"seeds,"

00:06:09.896 --> 00:06:12.430
so that means that it has to
refer to Christ.

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:16.000
Christ is the seed of Abraham
not all the people of Israel.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.968
My point is this,
the law which came four hundred

00:06:18.968 --> 00:06:21.994
thirty years later,
does not annul a covenant

00:06:21.994 --> 00:06:25.790
previously ratified by God so as
to nullify the promise.

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:28.403
For if the inheritance comes
from the law it no longer is

00:06:28.403 --> 00:06:30.226
from promise,
but God granted to Abraham

00:06:30.226 --> 00:06:31.160
through promise.
 

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:34.843
Notice what he's doing here,
he differentiates the law from

00:06:34.843 --> 00:06:38.910
promise, which would be very odd
coming for a Jew at the time.

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:41.851
Separating off the law from
faith, separating off the law

00:06:41.851 --> 00:06:44.687
from promise is counter
intuitive in Jewish theology at

00:06:44.687 --> 00:06:45.370
the time.
 

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:50.255
Then what he also says is the
law came 430 years after God

00:06:50.255 --> 00:06:53.600
made his first covenant with
Abraham.

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:56.218
Abraham just--God justified
Abraham by faith,

00:06:56.218 --> 00:06:59.672
although he was circumcised
later, but the circumcision was

00:06:59.672 --> 00:07:03.276
not what justified him;
it was his faith that justified

00:07:03.276 --> 00:07:04.500
him, even Abraham.
 

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:07.149
He takes all the way back to
the father of the Jews and says,

00:07:07.149 --> 00:07:08.689
God made a commitment with
Abraham,

00:07:08.689 --> 00:07:12.531
the law came 430 years later,
so the law is a late comer in

00:07:12.531 --> 00:07:16.110
the whole system of how God was
dealing with people.

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:18.689
Then look at what he says in
3:19 right after that,

00:07:18.689 --> 00:07:20.290
"Why then the law?"
 

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:23.505
In other words if you had the
covenant with Abraham why did

00:07:23.505 --> 00:07:25.060
the law come about anyway?
 

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:28.202
You didn't need the law to have
the covenant according to his

00:07:28.202 --> 00:07:28.779
theology.
 

00:07:28.779 --> 00:07:30.269
He says,
Why then the law?

00:07:30.269 --> 00:07:32.721
It was added because of
transgressions until the

00:07:32.721 --> 00:07:35.750
offspring would come to whom the
promise had been made,

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:38.860
and it was ordained through
angels by a mediator.

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:40.850
Now this is really weird.
 

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:44.940
"The law came about for
transgressions."

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:48.711
Now there's a way to--there's a
couple ways you could understand

00:07:48.711 --> 00:07:50.613
this,
and the way most modern

00:07:50.613 --> 00:07:54.267
Christians read it is the law
came about to keep people from

00:07:54.267 --> 00:07:54.949
sinning.
 

00:07:54.949 --> 00:07:57.423
You know what you're not
supposed to do by reading the

00:07:57.423 --> 00:07:59.048
law,
so the law comes back to keep

00:07:59.048 --> 00:08:02.060
you from transgressing,
but I don't think that's what

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:05.975
Paul's doing because precisely
in Romans 5:20 when he makes a

00:08:05.975 --> 00:08:09.440
similar statement,
it's very clear there that the

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:12.149
law came in to increase
transgressions.

00:08:12.149 --> 00:08:15.105
What he's saying here is
somehow the law came in after

00:08:15.105 --> 00:08:18.230
the covenant was already
established and it was precisely

00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:22.512
brought in through--
much later and it was added to

00:08:22.512 --> 00:08:25.850
increase sin in the
world.

00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:27.649
It's a very odd thing to say.
 

00:08:27.649 --> 00:08:30.045
Notice what he also says,
"It was ordained by

00:08:30.045 --> 00:08:30.778
angels."
 

00:08:30.778 --> 00:08:33.336
I've talked about this before
when we talked about the speech

00:08:33.336 --> 00:08:33.889
of Stephen.
 

00:08:33.889 --> 00:08:38.166
Paul's saying that God wasn't
even the one who gave the law to

00:08:38.166 --> 00:08:40.408
Moses, it was given by angels.
 

00:08:40.408 --> 00:08:45.168
He says, "It was ordained
through angels by a

00:08:45.168 --> 00:08:46.820
mediator."
 

00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:48.080
Well who was the mediator?
 

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:49.990
Moses right?
 

00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:52.679
"Now a mediator involves
more than one party;

00:08:52.679 --> 00:08:54.590
but God is one."
 

00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:58.346
That's odd, but it seems to
express what would have been

00:08:58.346 --> 00:09:01.490
sort of a legal theory in the
ancient world.

00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:04.898
For example,
if I want to sign a contract

00:09:04.898 --> 00:09:09.330
with all of you we don't have to
have a mediator,

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:12.149
you just basically choose one
of you or a committee of you to

00:09:12.149 --> 00:09:14.658
represent you,
and I represent myself.

00:09:14.658 --> 00:09:17.081
If I want to sign a contract
just with Jude,

00:09:17.081 --> 00:09:20.177
then we don't need a mediator,
we just sign the contract

00:09:20.177 --> 00:09:20.908
together.
 

00:09:20.908 --> 00:09:24.378
But if you have two groups of
people wanting to come to some

00:09:24.378 --> 00:09:26.730
kind of agreement to have a
contract,

00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:30.341
a covenant, you need a mediator
who can be in the middle and not

00:09:30.341 --> 00:09:33.379
represent either of their
interests but be neutral.

00:09:33.379 --> 00:09:36.149
What he's saying is that
there's a mediator here,

00:09:36.149 --> 00:09:38.610
all the Jews know that Moses
was the mediator,

00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:41.889
but if the contract was between
God--

00:09:41.889 --> 00:09:45.159
if the law was between God and
the Israelites you didn't have

00:09:45.159 --> 00:09:47.847
to have a mediator,
and he says that's precisely

00:09:47.847 --> 00:09:50.591
why they had to have mediator,
it wasn't between God and the

00:09:50.591 --> 00:09:52.798
Israelites,
it was between the angels and

00:09:52.798 --> 00:09:53.759
the Israelites.
 

00:09:53.759 --> 00:09:58.029
Notice how demoting this is,
how a certain piety of the law,

00:09:58.029 --> 00:10:01.019
you believe the law came 430
years after the covenant,

00:10:01.019 --> 00:10:05.011
it was given by angels to
Moses, not even directly from

00:10:05.011 --> 00:10:08.986
God,
and it was given in order to

00:10:08.986 --> 00:10:13.678
make sin worse not to get rid of
sin.

00:10:13.678 --> 00:10:17.552
Look what he says in 3:23,
he's digging himself deeper

00:10:17.552 --> 00:10:18.210
though.
 

00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:21.494
He's saying more and more
negative things about the Jewish

00:10:21.494 --> 00:10:21.840
law.
 

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:25.836
3:23: "Before faith came
we were imprisoned and guarded

00:10:25.836 --> 00:10:29.360
under the law until faith would
be revealed."

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:33.558
Now the law becomes a prison
guard that keeps humanity,

00:10:33.558 --> 00:10:36.490
and he seems to talking about
all of humanity not just Jews,

00:10:36.490 --> 00:10:39.158
somehow the law,
the Jewish law put all of

00:10:39.158 --> 00:10:42.740
humanity in prison and kept it
there all those years.

00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:45.817
Look what he says in 3:24,
"Therefore the law was our

00:10:45.817 --> 00:10:49.274
disciplinarian until Christ came
so that we might be justified by

00:10:49.274 --> 00:10:50.139
faith."
 

00:10:50.139 --> 00:10:52.533
Well the word
"disciplinarian"

00:10:52.533 --> 00:10:55.480
there is the Greek word
"pedagogue."

00:10:55.480 --> 00:11:00.951
Does anybody have pedagogue in
your Greek translation there at

00:11:00.951 --> 00:11:01.580
3:24?
 

00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:04.926
Does anybody have a different
translation at 3:24 then

00:11:04.926 --> 00:11:06.000
disciplinarian?
 

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.190
Yes sir in the back.
 

00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:10.649
Student: 
&gt;

00:11:10.649 --> 00:11:13.298
Prof: What is 3:24,
"Therefore the law was

00:11:13.298 --> 00:11:15.472
our--
Student:  The law was

00:11:15.472 --> 00:11:17.120
&gt;
 

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:19.277
Prof: Okay,
it was put in charge,

00:11:19.277 --> 00:11:20.658
so it's someone charge.
 

00:11:20.658 --> 00:11:23.609
It refers to the slave,
because these were almost

00:11:23.609 --> 00:11:26.129
always slaves,
who took care of young boys

00:11:26.129 --> 00:11:28.278
when they were going to school.
 

00:11:28.278 --> 00:11:31.278
A child would,
up to a certain age,

00:11:31.278 --> 00:11:33.976
would under the care--obviously
they were talking about upper

00:11:33.976 --> 00:11:35.820
class people who had slaves and
could--

00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:38.123
and would put their children
into the care of nurses and

00:11:38.123 --> 00:11:38.500
slaves.
 

00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:41.004
The child at a very young age
would be under the care of a

00:11:41.004 --> 00:11:42.654
nurse,
but at a certain age,

00:11:42.654 --> 00:11:45.674
maybe five or six,
the child, the boy especially,

00:11:45.674 --> 00:11:49.508
would be put in the charge of a
slave who basically was assigned

00:11:49.508 --> 00:11:51.029
to watch over the kid.
 

00:11:51.029 --> 00:11:53.606
The "pedagogue,"
contrary to the way this has

00:11:53.606 --> 00:11:56.980
come into English as pedagogue,
didn't refer primarily to the

00:11:56.980 --> 00:11:58.309
teacher of the child.
 

00:11:58.309 --> 00:11:59.639
That was a different term.
 

00:11:59.639 --> 00:12:03.374
The pedagogue was a slave who
just basically took care of the

00:12:03.374 --> 00:12:05.921
boy,
made sure the boy--carried the

00:12:05.921 --> 00:12:08.474
kid's books to school,
had the tablets,

00:12:08.474 --> 00:12:11.769
the wax tablets they wrote on
and the blocks they wrote on,

00:12:11.769 --> 00:12:14.769
kept the kid's stuff in a
little satchel,

00:12:14.769 --> 00:12:17.571
and watched the kid,
took the kid to school to make

00:12:17.571 --> 00:12:20.514
sure the kid got there safely,
make sure no older boys were

00:12:20.514 --> 00:12:22.820
bullies or make sure the kid
didn't get into any trouble,

00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:25.320
and then stayed in school and
sat--maybe sat in the classroom

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:27.570
or sat outside the classroom
until school was over,

00:12:27.570 --> 00:12:29.490
then took the kid back home,
made sure the kid did his

00:12:29.490 --> 00:12:29.889
homework.
 

00:12:29.889 --> 00:12:32.139
And according to a lot of Greek
literature,

00:12:32.139 --> 00:12:34.558
pedagogues are--not only are
they slaves,

00:12:34.558 --> 00:12:36.543
they're ugly,
we have lots and lots of

00:12:36.543 --> 00:12:39.437
artistic representations of
pedagogues in ancient terra

00:12:39.437 --> 00:12:42.687
cotta and that sort of thing,
and they're usually depicted as

00:12:42.687 --> 00:12:44.184
this ugly,
stumped slaves,

00:12:44.184 --> 00:12:47.149
and they're often depicted as
mean and cruel,

00:12:47.149 --> 00:12:48.940
and they beat the kids all the
time.

00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:52.090
By calling the law a pedagogue
here,

00:12:52.090 --> 00:12:54.950
I don't think Paul's saying
that the law was our teacher,

00:12:54.950 --> 00:12:58.038
I think what he's saying is the
law is that slave,

00:12:58.038 --> 00:13:01.700
a serviling who kept us
basically enslaved;

00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:03.000
remember he just said we're
prisoners.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:09.578
Look what he says in 4:3,
"So with us when we were

00:13:09.578 --> 00:13:16.158
minors we were enslaved to the
elemental spirits of the

00:13:16.158 --> 00:13:18.230
cosmos."
 

00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:20.071
The term "elemental
spirits"

00:13:20.071 --> 00:13:22.610
goes back to something I talked
about previously;

00:13:22.610 --> 00:13:25.120
I think it was in my lecture
when I talked about Stephen's

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:25.870
speech in Acts.
 

00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:29.942
This is that Greek word
stoichea,

00:13:29.942 --> 00:13:35.375
stoichea is a very,
very big major Greek word,

00:13:35.375 --> 00:13:39.240
it can used in all kinds of
ways.

00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:41.808
For one thing it just referred
to ranks of soldiers.

00:13:41.808 --> 00:13:45.817
If soldiers were lined up in
different ranks those ranks were

00:13:45.817 --> 00:13:47.418
stoichea, rows.
 

00:13:47.418 --> 00:13:49.009
It could refer to all kinds of
other rows,

00:13:49.009 --> 00:13:51.993
it could refer to letters of an
alphabet that could be talked

00:13:51.993 --> 00:13:54.529
about as stoichea because
what do you do,

00:13:54.529 --> 00:13:56.470
you put them--you put all the
letters of the alphabet in a row

00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:57.592
and you--
and there are different

00:13:57.592 --> 00:13:57.928
elements.
 

00:13:57.928 --> 00:14:01.269
Stoichea also could
refer to what we would call

00:14:01.269 --> 00:14:03.980
chemical elements,
the table of elements;

00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:06.908
those would be called
stoichea in Greek.

00:14:06.908 --> 00:14:09.130
For example,
they took wind,

00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:11.052
fire,
water, and air,

00:14:11.052 --> 00:14:14.250
and sometimes there were other
four--

00:14:14.250 --> 00:14:16.788
earth sometimes,
you've heard this theory right,

00:14:16.788 --> 00:14:19.474
that the Greeks believed and
the ancient people believed

00:14:19.474 --> 00:14:22.110
there were four fundamental
elements of all matter,

00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:25.009
and those--or sometimes they
said six,

00:14:25.009 --> 00:14:26.559
sometimes eight,
sometimes others,

00:14:26.559 --> 00:14:29.379
but quite often they'd settle
on four classical elements--

00:14:29.379 --> 00:14:31.636
and they believed that
everything was made up of some

00:14:31.636 --> 00:14:33.619
combination of earth,
fire, water,

00:14:33.619 --> 00:14:37.298
and air, and everything is some
matter though.

00:14:37.298 --> 00:14:39.548
The thicker stuff has more
earth in it and less air,

00:14:39.548 --> 00:14:41.870
the lighter stuff has more air
in it and less earth,

00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:44.269
but all matter is made up of
these four elements.

00:14:44.269 --> 00:14:48.751
These elements constitute the
whole cosmos but what's really

00:14:48.751 --> 00:14:51.614
interesting is,
at least a lot of people in the

00:14:51.614 --> 00:14:53.350
ancient world believed that
these--

00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:57.730
this term also referred to the
sort of angelic or demonic,

00:14:57.730 --> 00:15:01.759
or godlike beings who
constitute the universe also.

00:15:01.759 --> 00:15:04.155
In other words,
they didn't believe necessarily

00:15:04.155 --> 00:15:06.240
that air was simply an inert
material.

00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:10.230
It also was a god or some kind
of demonic being.

00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:14.042
Or some people would say that
each of these different layers

00:15:14.042 --> 00:15:17.086
of the universe,
say the layer that is earth or

00:15:17.086 --> 00:15:20.042
the layer that is water,
or the layer that is air,

00:15:20.042 --> 00:15:22.308
or the top layer that is fire
or ether,

00:15:22.308 --> 00:15:25.639
that those are all divine
beings themselves,

00:15:25.639 --> 00:15:28.624
or they could talk about them
as being not divine beings

00:15:28.624 --> 00:15:31.120
themselves but being ruled by
divine beings.

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:34.032
Even Jews, for example,
would think that there were

00:15:34.032 --> 00:15:37.351
certain angels who were in
charge of different rows of the

00:15:37.351 --> 00:15:38.110
universe.
 

00:15:38.110 --> 00:15:40.150
For example,
if you--this is what we talked

00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:43.025
about in Gnosticism,
if you wanted to go to God,

00:15:43.025 --> 00:15:46.019
according to some magical texts
for example,

00:15:46.019 --> 00:15:49.138
you had to figure out the
tricks to go through the

00:15:49.138 --> 00:15:52.702
different ranks of demons or
angels that lived in the sky

00:15:52.702 --> 00:15:54.230
between you and God.
 

00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:57.149
One way to do that is to learn
the secret passwords,

00:15:57.149 --> 00:15:59.982
so magical texts often will
give you what look like

00:15:59.982 --> 00:16:01.828
passwords,
because we've had this

00:16:01.828 --> 00:16:04.399
password, and when your soul is
flying up to God,

00:16:04.399 --> 00:16:06.955
you can give the password to
whatever demon or angel is

00:16:06.955 --> 00:16:09.178
guarding different gates between
you and God.

00:16:09.178 --> 00:16:12.678
These stoichea refers to
elements of the universe in a

00:16:12.678 --> 00:16:16.062
physical sense but it also
refers to these spiritual beings

00:16:16.062 --> 00:16:18.923
that rule the cosmos,
or even make up the stuff of

00:16:18.923 --> 00:16:20.889
the cosmos and a lot of ancient
thought.

00:16:20.889 --> 00:16:23.000
Now notice what Paul is saying
here,

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.657
"When we were under the
law we were enslaved to the

00:16:26.657 --> 00:16:29.450
elemental spirits of the
universe."

00:16:29.450 --> 00:16:31.653
Being under the law is being
enslaved to these,

00:16:31.653 --> 00:16:34.048
and he says you want to go back
to that slavery?

00:16:34.048 --> 00:16:36.080
Wait a minute,
what are the Galatians doing?

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:37.772
They're not saying,
we want to go back and serve

00:16:37.772 --> 00:16:38.058
idols.
 

00:16:38.058 --> 00:16:41.381
What Paul is saying is,
when you served idols you were

00:16:41.381 --> 00:16:44.830
actually serving the
stoichea of the universe.

00:16:44.830 --> 00:16:47.330
They weren't real gods they
were fake gods.

00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:50.009
These are some kind of angelic
beings or demonic beings.

00:16:50.009 --> 00:16:52.393
Paul, I think,
believed they were real beings

00:16:52.393 --> 00:16:55.427
behind idols but they were
demons or something like that,

00:16:55.427 --> 00:16:57.538
and the stoichea were
those.

00:16:57.538 --> 00:16:59.859
The Galatians are not wanting
to go back to idol worship

00:16:59.859 --> 00:17:01.629
apparently, what are they
wanting to do?

00:17:01.629 --> 00:17:03.225
They're just thinking,
well we're going to keep the

00:17:03.225 --> 00:17:03.639
Jewish law.
 

00:17:03.639 --> 00:17:08.648
But Paul, not they,
equates keeping the Jewish law,

00:17:08.648 --> 00:17:13.759
if you're a Gentile,
with going back to idolatry.

00:17:13.759 --> 00:17:17.255
That is radical,
for any Jew in the first

00:17:17.255 --> 00:17:21.450
century to equate law
observance, keeping kosher,

00:17:21.450 --> 00:17:26.170
being circumcised with actually
worshipping idols.

00:17:26.170 --> 00:17:31.132
That's radical,
and yet that's what Paul's

00:17:31.132 --> 00:17:34.279
doing here in Galatians.
 

00:17:34.279 --> 00:17:36.818
I say that because in 4:8 he
says,

00:17:36.818 --> 00:17:39.278
"Formerly,
when you did not know God you

00:17:39.278 --> 00:17:42.630
were enslaved to beings that are
by nature not gods."

00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:45.075
That is you're enslaved to
demons or some kind of other

00:17:45.075 --> 00:17:45.890
being like that.
 

00:17:45.890 --> 00:17:47.779
"Now however that you've
come to know God,

00:17:47.779 --> 00:17:51.684
or rather to be known by God,
how can you turn back again to

00:17:51.684 --> 00:17:54.730
the weak and beggarly
stoichea?"

00:17:54.730 --> 00:17:59.750
He's equating their attempt to
keep kosher or be circumcised

00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:02.730
with their returning to
idolatry.

00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:05.291
Then look what he says in his
little exegesis in 4:21,

00:18:05.291 --> 00:18:08.193
here he has a good ten verses
that are important so I'm going

00:18:08.193 --> 00:18:09.788
to read the whole ten verses.
 

00:18:09.788 --> 00:18:14.912
Tell me, you who desire to be
subject to the law will you not

00:18:14.912 --> 00:18:16.618
listen to the law?
 

00:18:16.618 --> 00:18:19.156
[He's going to give you a
little exegesis here.]

00:18:19.156 --> 00:18:21.480
For it is written that Abraham
had two sons,

00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:24.450
one by a slave woman and the
other by a free woman.

00:18:24.450 --> 00:18:26.948
One, the child of a slave,
was born according to the

00:18:26.948 --> 00:18:29.153
flesh, the other,
the child of the free woman,

00:18:29.153 --> 00:18:30.769
was born through the promise.
 

00:18:30.769 --> 00:18:34.509
Now this is an allegory,
these women are two covenants.

00:18:34.509 --> 00:18:37.195
One woman in fact is Hagar from
Mt.

00:18:37.195 --> 00:18:40.118
Sinai bearing children for
slavery.

00:18:40.118 --> 00:18:45.516
Wait minute,
Hagar is the slave of

00:18:45.516 --> 00:18:48.618
Abraham not his wife.
 

00:18:48.618 --> 00:18:53.400
Sarah is the wife of
Abraham not his slave.

00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:58.330
Isaac, who then had Jacob,
who then had Joseph and all the

00:18:58.330 --> 00:19:02.223
brothers, from whom the people
of Israel came,

00:19:02.223 --> 00:19:05.078
came through Sarah not Hagar.
 

00:19:05.078 --> 00:19:08.727
According to Jewish mythology
who were the descendants of

00:19:08.727 --> 00:19:10.028
Hagar and Ishmael?
 

00:19:10.028 --> 00:19:11.309
Student: 
&gt;

00:19:11.309 --> 00:19:13.259
Prof: Pardon?
 

00:19:13.259 --> 00:19:15.308
Who are the--
Student: 

00:19:15.308 --> 00:19:16.170
&gt;
 

00:19:16.170 --> 00:19:18.838
Prof: Not Muslims but
Arabs.

00:19:18.838 --> 00:19:21.596
Yes--because not all
Muslims--but according to Jewish

00:19:21.596 --> 00:19:24.938
mythology Arabs are the ones who
descend from Hagar and Ishmael,

00:19:24.938 --> 00:19:25.838
not the Jews.
 

00:19:25.838 --> 00:19:29.119
Paul equates Hagar with Mt.
 

00:19:29.119 --> 00:19:36.288
Sinai, which is the mountain
from which Moses got the law.

00:19:36.288 --> 00:19:40.881
Why does he connect Hagar who
represents the non-Jews with

00:19:40.881 --> 00:19:43.538
Sinai which represents the law?
 

00:19:43.538 --> 00:19:48.150
You would think he would
represent Sarah with Sinai.

00:19:48.150 --> 00:19:50.079
"Now Hagar is Mt.
 

00:19:50.079 --> 00:19:54.905
Sinai in Arabia and corresponds
to the present Jerusalem

00:19:54.905 --> 00:19:55.960
..."
 

00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:57.400
Jerusalem?
 

00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:02.028
Sarah should correspond to
Jerusalem, "...

00:20:02.028 --> 00:20:06.558
for she is in slavery with her
children, but the other woman

00:20:06.558 --> 00:20:09.858
corresponds to the Jerusalem
above."

00:20:09.858 --> 00:20:13.351
Now he gets another Jerusalem,
now there's some kind of

00:20:13.351 --> 00:20:16.390
heavenly Jerusalem
that's--what's represented by

00:20:16.390 --> 00:20:17.490
Sarah."
 

00:20:17.490 --> 00:20:21.490
She is free and she is our
mother.

00:20:21.490 --> 00:20:23.078
For it is written,
"Rejoice,

00:20:23.078 --> 00:20:24.568
you childless one who bear no
children,

00:20:24.568 --> 00:20:27.210
burst into song and shout,
you who endure no birth pains,

00:20:27.210 --> 00:20:29.193
for the children of the
desolate woman are more numerous

00:20:29.193 --> 00:20:31.068
then the children of the one who
is married."

00:20:31.068 --> 00:20:34.308
Now you my friends are children
of promise like Isaac.

00:20:34.308 --> 00:20:37.190
Now he's talking to Gentiles
here, he's not talking to Jews.

00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:39.807
He's saying,
you Gentiles are children of

00:20:39.807 --> 00:20:42.230
promise, you're connected to
Isaac.

00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:44.904
"But just as that time the
child who was born according to

00:20:44.904 --> 00:20:47.452
the flesh persecuted the child
who was born according to the

00:20:47.452 --> 00:20:49.500
spirit,
so it is now also."

00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:54.159
Wait a minute,
it seems like he's accusing the

00:20:54.159 --> 00:20:59.440
Jews of persecuting non-Jews,
followers of Jesus.

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:02.000
What does the scripture say?
 

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.397
"Drive out the slave and
her child for the child of the

00:21:04.397 --> 00:21:06.553
slave will not share the
inheritance with the child of

00:21:06.553 --> 00:21:07.568
the free woman."
 

00:21:07.568 --> 00:21:10.083
So friends we are children not
of the slave but of the free

00:21:10.083 --> 00:21:10.430
woman.
 

00:21:10.430 --> 00:21:13.618
Drive out the slave woman.
 

00:21:13.618 --> 00:21:18.380
If he's equated the slave woman
Hagar with Mt.

00:21:18.380 --> 00:21:24.114
Sinai, with Jerusalem in Judea,
it seems like he's equating

00:21:24.114 --> 00:21:28.662
Hagar with the Jews,
at least the law observant

00:21:28.662 --> 00:21:32.420
Jews, and he says,
drive them out?

00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:35.618
That is very radical.
 

00:21:35.618 --> 00:21:40.901
And then finally he ends up
later in Chapter 5:4 and then

00:21:40.901 --> 00:21:44.635
I'll move on,
"You who want to be

00:21:44.635 --> 00:21:50.108
justified by the law have cut
yourselves off from Christ,

00:21:50.108 --> 00:21:54.328
you have fallen away from
grace."

00:21:54.328 --> 00:21:58.529
Notice he's not saying that
you're going to fall away from

00:21:58.529 --> 00:21:59.930
grace if you sin.
 

00:21:59.930 --> 00:22:02.250
That doesn't seem to be the
problem.

00:22:02.250 --> 00:22:05.645
He's saying,
if you Gentile followers of

00:22:05.645 --> 00:22:10.785
Jesus even attempt to keep the
Jewish law, you'll be cut off

00:22:10.785 --> 00:22:13.049
from the grace of God.
 

00:22:13.049 --> 00:22:16.278
That's radical.
 

00:22:16.278 --> 00:22:21.450
It's no wonder that all this
stuff got Paul into trouble.

00:22:21.450 --> 00:22:23.977
Now we don't know what happened
with Paul's letters to the

00:22:23.977 --> 00:22:24.509
Galatians.
 

00:22:24.509 --> 00:22:28.539
We don't know whether he
convinced them that he was right

00:22:28.539 --> 00:22:31.420
and the other people who were
coming--

00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:33.730
telling them--teaching them to
obey the law were wrong.

00:22:33.730 --> 00:22:36.028
We don't have second Galatians
unfortunately,

00:22:36.028 --> 00:22:37.230
or any other letters.
 

00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:41.266
It has been pointed by some
scholars that Paul never talks

00:22:41.266 --> 00:22:45.019
about the collection that he
later takes up which--

00:22:45.019 --> 00:22:46.904
among his different churches
which I'll talk about in a

00:22:46.904 --> 00:22:47.220
minute.
 

00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:49.308
He never talks about that in
Galatians,

00:22:49.308 --> 00:22:52.646
nor does he ever mention the
area of Galatians again to any

00:22:52.646 --> 00:22:54.950
of his other churches in other
areas,

00:22:54.950 --> 00:22:57.210
and that's led some people to
suggest,

00:22:57.210 --> 00:23:00.930
well maybe Paul lost the battle
in the churches of Galatia,

00:23:00.930 --> 00:23:03.230
and, therefore,
he just didn't deal with them

00:23:03.230 --> 00:23:04.328
anymore after that.
 

00:23:04.328 --> 00:23:08.020
We have references in his his
letters to churches in Achaea,

00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:08.960
like Corinth.
 

00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:12.259
We have reference to his
churches in Macedonia,

00:23:12.259 --> 00:23:14.078
we have reference to churches
in Ephesus,

00:23:14.078 --> 00:23:16.173
we have reference to different
churches where we know Paul

00:23:16.173 --> 00:23:17.999
founded churches,
but we don't ever have any

00:23:17.999 --> 00:23:19.338
reference elsewhere to Galatia.
 

00:23:19.338 --> 00:23:21.487
Some people have said,
maybe he lost the battle,

00:23:21.487 --> 00:23:24.000
maybe he lost the argument,
and that's why we don't hear

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:24.960
anymore about it.
 

00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:26.440
But we don't know that for sure.
 

00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:29.117
The letter though,
if Paul went around teaching

00:23:29.117 --> 00:23:31.486
this kind of stuff,
it clearly, though,

00:23:31.486 --> 00:23:34.690
got him in trouble with other
people who just thought,

00:23:34.690 --> 00:23:37.710
not only was this wrong but it
sounded antinomian,

00:23:37.710 --> 00:23:42.359
it sounded anti-law in general,
and that leads us to Romans.

00:23:42.359 --> 00:23:44.118
Now turn over to Romans.
 

00:23:44.118 --> 00:23:48.266
Romans is written in a very
different situation,

00:23:48.266 --> 00:23:53.118
but let's first just see,
what does Romans tell us about

00:23:53.118 --> 00:23:57.089
Paul's reputation with regard to
the law?

00:23:57.089 --> 00:24:00.220
Look in Romans 3:8.
 

00:24:07.098 --> 00:24:10.327
Now in chapter 3 he's talking
about a lot of different things

00:24:10.327 --> 00:24:12.830
about justification by faith,
apart from law,

00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:16.009
but just in verse 8 I'm just
going to take a clue out here,

00:24:16.009 --> 00:24:19.565
"But why not say,
as some people slander us by

00:24:19.565 --> 00:24:23.336
saying that we say,
let us do evil that good may

00:24:23.336 --> 00:24:23.808
come?
 

00:24:23.808 --> 00:24:26.690
Their condemnation is
deserved."

00:24:26.690 --> 00:24:30.183
Paul denies the charge,
but is it very hard to imagine

00:24:30.183 --> 00:24:34.009
why some people who may have
heard about the kinds of stuff

00:24:34.009 --> 00:24:37.088
he says about the law,
the law was brought in to

00:24:37.088 --> 00:24:39.509
increase transgression,
and then transgression

00:24:39.509 --> 00:24:42.308
increased so that God could have
more grace and mercy?

00:24:42.308 --> 00:24:45.763
Doesn't that sound like Paul is
saying, let us do evil so that

00:24:45.763 --> 00:24:46.670
good may come?
 

00:24:46.670 --> 00:24:48.568
Apparently some people thought
it did,

00:24:48.568 --> 00:24:51.650
so Paul brings up the charge
and denies it,

00:24:51.650 --> 00:24:54.546
but it shows that Paul had
already developed by this time

00:24:54.546 --> 00:24:56.460
some kind of antinomian
reputation.

00:24:56.460 --> 00:25:00.896
Notice what he says in Romans
6, in the sixth chapter:

00:25:00.896 --> 00:25:05.171
"What then are we to say,
should we continue in sin in

00:25:05.171 --> 00:25:07.058
order that grace may
abound?"

00:25:07.058 --> 00:25:09.556
It sounds like that would be
the logical outcome,

00:25:09.556 --> 00:25:09.920
Paul.
 

00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:14.806
You've just said several times
that as sin increased in the

00:25:14.806 --> 00:25:18.430
world grace increases more,
so let's sin.

00:25:18.430 --> 00:25:21.259
We're not saved by doing good
anyway, we're not saved by

00:25:21.259 --> 00:25:23.627
following the law,
so let's just ignore the law

00:25:23.627 --> 00:25:25.430
and sin, and grace will abound.
 

00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:28.455
Paul again seems to be echoing
something that could be a very

00:25:28.455 --> 00:25:29.920
logical charge against him.
 

00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:31.029
How does he answer it?
 

00:25:31.029 --> 00:25:32.430
"By no means!
 

00:25:32.430 --> 00:25:37.058
How can we who died to sin go
on living in it?"

00:25:37.058 --> 00:25:40.741
Here he goes on to answer the
charge in the rest of Chapter 6

00:25:40.741 --> 00:25:43.413
by saying,
by coming--by being baptized in

00:25:43.413 --> 00:25:47.160
the Christ you have so vacated
the whole realm of sin that it's

00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:49.940
inconceivable that you could go
back to it.

00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:52.255
As long as you're in Christ you
can have nothing to do with the

00:25:52.255 --> 00:25:53.038
whole world of sin.
 

00:25:53.038 --> 00:25:56.048
He gets rid of that charge,
but we can see that some people

00:25:56.048 --> 00:25:59.058
saw that there was a logical
connection between some of the

00:25:59.058 --> 00:26:01.549
things he had said in places
like Galatians.

00:26:01.549 --> 00:26:03.210
He has to deny it.
 

00:26:03.210 --> 00:26:05.519
He does the same thing in 6:15,
"What then?

00:26:05.519 --> 00:26:07.817
Should we sin because we are
not under law but under

00:26:07.817 --> 00:26:08.450
grace?"
 

00:26:08.450 --> 00:26:10.740
He says no, no,
no, no by no means;

00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:12.180
that's not what I mean.
 

00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:17.058
You can see how he got the
accusation.

00:26:17.058 --> 00:26:20.992
Then in 3:20,
some of the other places he

00:26:20.992 --> 00:26:24.140
talks about the law in Romans.
 

00:26:24.140 --> 00:26:27.508
"For no human being will
be justified in his sight by

00:26:27.508 --> 00:26:31.268
deeds prescribed by the law,
for through the law comes

00:26:31.268 --> 00:26:33.118
knowledge of sin."
 

00:26:33.118 --> 00:26:37.375
You can hear Paul's gears
working, he's trying to nuance

00:26:37.375 --> 00:26:42.173
some of the things he's saying
about the law so that it doesn't

00:26:42.173 --> 00:26:46.740
sound quite as radical as he had
sounded in Galatians,

00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:49.180
and that he may likely have
sounded elsewhere.

00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:52.073
Right here he admits,
therefore, well the law is good

00:26:52.073 --> 00:26:54.632
for some things,
through the law came knowledge

00:26:54.632 --> 00:26:56.578
of sin, so that's a good thing.
 

00:26:56.578 --> 00:27:00.308
Look what he says in 3:21,
right below that:

00:27:00.308 --> 00:27:05.164
"But now apart from law
the righteousness of God has

00:27:05.164 --> 00:27:08.563
been disclosed,
and it is attested by the law

00:27:08.563 --> 00:27:09.940
and the prophets."
 

00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:13.335
So both the Torah,
the law, and the prophets at

00:27:13.335 --> 00:27:17.098
least bears witness to the
righteousness of God,

00:27:17.098 --> 00:27:20.323
because, as you'll notice,
throughout both Galatians and

00:27:20.323 --> 00:27:22.484
Romans,
Paul quotes Jewish scripture

00:27:22.484 --> 00:27:25.130
more than he does in any of his
other letters.

00:27:25.130 --> 00:27:29.580
It's precisely when Paul is
dealing with the problem of what

00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:34.032
is the relationship between
non-Jews to Jewish law that Paul

00:27:34.032 --> 00:27:37.578
actually quotes Jewish scripture
the most,

00:27:37.578 --> 00:27:39.380
and that's in Galatians and
Romans.

00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:43.171
Here he's saying we can look at
the law and the prophets to

00:27:43.171 --> 00:27:46.700
learn about this doctrine of
righteousness that I'm now

00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:50.098
saying to you because the law
will attest to it.

00:27:50.098 --> 00:27:53.029
It's a much more positive view
of the law.

00:27:53.029 --> 00:27:56.355
And then he also says,
we uphold the law by doing

00:27:56.355 --> 00:27:56.839
this.
 

00:27:56.839 --> 00:28:08.349
Look at 3:27:
Then what becomes of boasting?

00:28:08.349 --> 00:28:09.039
It is excluded.
 

00:28:09.039 --> 00:28:09.619
By what law?
 

00:28:09.619 --> 00:28:10.279
By that of works?
 

00:28:10.279 --> 00:28:11.160
No, but by the law of faith.
 

00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:13.336
For we hold that a person is
justified by faith apart from

00:28:13.336 --> 00:28:14.558
what is prescribed by the law.
 

00:28:14.558 --> 00:28:17.250
Or is God the God of the Jews
only?

00:28:17.250 --> 00:28:19.180
Is he not God of the Gentiles
also?

00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:21.608
Yes, of Gentiles also,
since God is one.

00:28:21.608 --> 00:28:23.577
Look at the last verse of that
chapter: "Do we then

00:28:23.577 --> 00:28:25.009
overthrow the law by this
faith?"

00:28:25.009 --> 00:28:27.364
You would have thought from
things that he said in Galatians

00:28:27.364 --> 00:28:29.400
that the answer to that would be
"yes."

00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:33.127
"By no means,
on the contrary,

00:28:33.127 --> 00:28:35.980
we uphold the law."
 

00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:39.759
And then look one more place
here 7:12,

00:28:39.759 --> 00:28:49.578
Romans 7:12 --back up one verse
to verse 11,

00:28:49.578 --> 00:28:52.791
"For sin seizing an
opportunity in the commandment

00:28:52.791 --> 00:28:55.470
deceived me and through it
killed me."

00:28:55.470 --> 00:28:57.868
Notice what happens here.
 

00:28:57.868 --> 00:29:01.848
Sin is talked about as this
agent of the cosmos;

00:29:01.848 --> 00:29:04.098
sin is almost like one of the
stoichea,

00:29:04.098 --> 00:29:05.650
kind of an intelligent being.
 

00:29:05.650 --> 00:29:08.568
This is actually a debate among
scholars of Paul.

00:29:08.568 --> 00:29:13.453
Some people really believe that
sin is a hypostatized

00:29:13.453 --> 00:29:17.868
intelligent being of some sort
in the cosmos.

00:29:17.868 --> 00:29:19.718
Other people say no,
no, Paul's talking

00:29:19.718 --> 00:29:22.490
metaphorically when he talks
about sin in these words,

00:29:22.490 --> 00:29:26.978
and we need to see sin not at
this actual hypostatized being

00:29:26.978 --> 00:29:30.598
but simply a metaphor,
a metaphorical being.

00:29:30.598 --> 00:29:34.144
So scholars themselves debate
about what Paul means when he

00:29:34.144 --> 00:29:36.098
talks about sin as this agent.
 

00:29:36.098 --> 00:29:44.209
At least he talks about sin as
the agent who uses the

00:29:44.209 --> 00:29:52.630
commandment, uses the law--where
was I just reading?

00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:53.509
Student:  7:11.
 

00:29:53.509 --> 00:29:55.836
Prof: 7:11 yes,
"Sin seizing an

00:29:55.836 --> 00:29:57.703
opportunity of the
commandment,"

00:29:57.703 --> 00:30:00.711
so sin uses the commandment to
deceive the human beings and

00:30:00.711 --> 00:30:01.490
kill them.
 

00:30:01.490 --> 00:30:04.118
Paul is not talking about
himself personally here;

00:30:04.118 --> 00:30:06.015
he's talking about himself as a
representative of all human

00:30:06.015 --> 00:30:06.308
beings.
 

00:30:06.308 --> 00:30:08.769
Then he says,
"So the law is holy and

00:30:08.769 --> 00:30:11.890
the commandment is holy,
and just, and good."

00:30:11.890 --> 00:30:16.818
Doesn't it strike you that that
little addition of verse 12

00:30:16.818 --> 00:30:21.240
doesn't seem to follow so
logically from verse 11?

00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:27.811
How can the law be holy,
and just, and good if it's

00:30:27.811 --> 00:30:30.308
deceiving people?
 

00:30:30.308 --> 00:30:33.720
What's clearly going on is Paul
is backing off the more radical

00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:37.019
things he's said about the law
and trying to nuance this,

00:30:37.019 --> 00:30:38.269
and that's the question I'll
ask.

00:30:38.269 --> 00:30:41.846
Let's read the rest of that,
For we know that the law is

00:30:41.846 --> 00:30:47.190
spiritual but I am of the flesh,
sold into slavery under sin.

00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:50.876
I do not understand my own
actions, for I do not do what I

00:30:50.876 --> 00:30:52.700
want;
I do the very thing I hate.

00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:55.650
Now if I do what I do not want
I agree that the law is good,

00:30:55.650 --> 00:30:58.500
but in fact it is no longer I
that do it, but the sin that

00:30:58.500 --> 00:30:59.348
dwells in me.
 

00:30:59.348 --> 00:31:01.586
For I know that nothing good
dwells within me,

00:31:01.586 --> 00:31:02.680
that is in my flesh.
 

00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:05.058
I can will what is right,
but I cannot do it.

00:31:05.058 --> 00:31:08.578
For I do not do the good I
want, but the evil I do not want

00:31:08.578 --> 00:31:09.490
is what I do.
 

00:31:09.490 --> 00:31:12.770
Now if I do what I do not want
it is no longer I that do it but

00:31:12.770 --> 00:31:14.200
sin that lives within me.
 

00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:17.924
So I find it to be a law that
when I want to do what is good,

00:31:17.924 --> 00:31:19.538
evil lies close at hand.
 

00:31:19.538 --> 00:31:23.276
For I delight in the law of God
in my inmost self but I see in

00:31:23.276 --> 00:31:26.828
my members another law at work
with the law of my mind,

00:31:26.828 --> 00:31:30.150
making me captive to the law of
sin that dwells in my members.

00:31:30.150 --> 00:31:32.997
Well all of that is very
confusing, and if you want to

00:31:32.997 --> 00:31:35.896
get a PhD you can do the
exegesis of it for the rest of

00:31:35.896 --> 00:31:36.650
your life.
 

00:31:36.650 --> 00:31:41.205
The main thing I'm pointing out
here is that Paul is being very

00:31:41.205 --> 00:31:44.512
careful to nuance a
straightforwardly negative

00:31:44.512 --> 00:31:47.599
depiction of Jewish law and say
that,

00:31:47.599 --> 00:31:49.420
well it's still good in a sense.
 

00:31:49.420 --> 00:31:51.969
It still is true,
it's still holy,

00:31:51.969 --> 00:31:56.527
and he's doing this because I
think he knows that he's got a

00:31:56.527 --> 00:32:00.700
reputation as being anti-law and
being antinomian.

00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:05.108
So why these differences
between Romans and Galatians?

00:32:05.108 --> 00:32:07.046
Well we need to understand a
little bit more about the Roman

00:32:07.046 --> 00:32:07.440
situation.
 

00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:11.190
First, Paul did not found the
church in Rome;

00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:14.420
it grew up on its own by other
people.

00:32:14.420 --> 00:32:16.397
According to church tradition,
according to Roman Catholic

00:32:16.397 --> 00:32:18.095
tradition,
Peter, the Apostle Peter

00:32:18.095 --> 00:32:21.260
founded the church in Rome,
but that's tradition and we

00:32:21.260 --> 00:32:24.400
don't have any historical data
to really prove it.

00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:28.359
And I personally believe that
probably the church in Rome was

00:32:28.359 --> 00:32:32.386
started by anonymous Jews who
happened to hear about Jesus and

00:32:32.386 --> 00:32:36.148
went to Rome and then started
little house groups of Jesus

00:32:36.148 --> 00:32:39.617
followers on their own,
and then Apostles came later,

00:32:39.617 --> 00:32:42.029
just like Paul seems to have
gone there later.

00:32:42.029 --> 00:32:45.425
The Roman church,
at the time Paul is writing

00:32:45.425 --> 00:32:50.288
this letter, is by this time no
longer a purely Jewish group.

00:32:50.288 --> 00:32:53.262
They now seem to be
predominantly Gentile,

00:32:53.262 --> 00:32:56.598
with some Jews in the churches
in Rome also.

00:32:56.598 --> 00:32:58.558
And remember we're not talking
about one church building or

00:32:58.558 --> 00:33:00.268
even one house church;
we're talking about probably

00:33:00.268 --> 00:33:02.257
several different house churches
that met in different people's

00:33:02.257 --> 00:33:03.664
houses,
or in their apartments,

00:33:03.664 --> 00:33:05.500
in tenements and these sorts of
things.

00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:08.430
Maybe some of them had more
Judaism than others.

00:33:08.430 --> 00:33:12.815
But the overall church in Rome
is by now apparently Gentile and

00:33:12.815 --> 00:33:16.279
when Paul writes Romans he
directs his rhetoric to

00:33:16.279 --> 00:33:17.200
Gentiles.
 

00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:20.950
He does say hello to some Jews
in the last chapter.

00:33:20.950 --> 00:33:23.578
He greets the Jews who are
there that he knows.

00:33:23.578 --> 00:33:25.598
But if you look through the
rhetoric of Romans,

00:33:25.598 --> 00:33:28.900
more and more of us scholars
are convinced that the main

00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:32.740
recipients of Paul's rhetoric is
supposed to be Gentile believers

00:33:32.740 --> 00:33:33.519
in Jesus.
 

00:33:33.519 --> 00:33:37.230
Why does Paul write this letter?
 

00:33:37.230 --> 00:33:39.420
Several different reasons,
not just one.

00:33:39.420 --> 00:33:42.118
For one thing he can't write
like he's written most of his

00:33:42.118 --> 00:33:44.440
other letters as talking to a
group he founded.

00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:47.688
He can't talk about himself as
their father in the faith in

00:33:47.688 --> 00:33:50.009
that way,
he can't set himself up as

00:33:50.009 --> 00:33:53.182
their Apostle in a
straightforward way because he's

00:33:53.182 --> 00:33:55.338
never been there at this point.
 

00:33:55.338 --> 00:33:57.088
He didn't found the churches
there,

00:33:57.088 --> 00:33:59.200
so he's writing a letter,
this is one of the very,

00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:02.160
very few things we have of
him--well the only letter

00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:05.585
perhaps where he writes a letter
to a church that he himself

00:34:05.585 --> 00:34:08.059
didn't found,
so that's important.

00:34:08.059 --> 00:34:09.869
What do we find out?
 

00:34:09.869 --> 00:34:10.880
Why is he writing it?
 

00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:13.260
Look at 15--Romans 15:22:
 

00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:23.744
This is the reason I have so
often been hindered from coming

00:34:23.744 --> 00:34:24.170
to you.
 

00:34:24.170 --> 00:34:27.668
[so he's wanted to go to Rome]
But now with no further place

00:34:27.668 --> 00:34:30.809
for me in these regions,
I desire, as I have for many

00:34:30.809 --> 00:34:33.179
years,
to come to you when I go to

00:34:33.179 --> 00:34:33.679
Spain.
 

00:34:33.679 --> 00:34:37.030
For I do hope to see you on my
journey and to be sent on by you

00:34:37.030 --> 00:34:39.949
once I have enjoyed your company
for a little while.

00:34:39.949 --> 00:34:43.547
Paul sees himself as the
Apostle to the Gentiles,

00:34:43.547 --> 00:34:46.469
as Peter was the Apostle to the
Jews.

00:34:46.469 --> 00:34:50.150
So why not?--I mean he didn't
found the church there but if he

00:34:50.150 --> 00:34:53.771
believes that he's already done
all this missionizing in Asia

00:34:53.771 --> 00:34:55.039
Minor and Greece.
 

00:34:55.039 --> 00:34:57.336
It's kind of ironic for Paul to
say this because what had he

00:34:57.336 --> 00:34:57.960
actually done?
 

00:34:57.960 --> 00:35:00.090
Christianity wasn't this big
movement with thousands of

00:35:00.090 --> 00:35:00.880
people everywhere.
 

00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:03.403
It wasn't even like there was a
Christian church in each city or

00:35:03.403 --> 00:35:05.889
town, but Paul seems to act like
he's done everything he can in

00:35:05.889 --> 00:35:06.409
the East.
 

00:35:06.409 --> 00:35:10.536
Yep, everything in Greece and
Asia Minor, my churches are all

00:35:10.536 --> 00:35:14.800
doing great, I got to get out of
here, my work here is done.

00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:16.940
And so he's taking off to the
west.

00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:18.690
It's kind of exaggerating,
I think,

00:35:18.690 --> 00:35:21.309
just exactly what he's
accomplished,

00:35:21.309 --> 00:35:25.043
but in his mind by planting a
few house churches in major

00:35:25.043 --> 00:35:27.641
cities,
he's sort of done the first job

00:35:27.641 --> 00:35:31.318
of evangelization that he saw
himself called by God and sent

00:35:31.318 --> 00:35:32.130
out to do.
 

00:35:32.130 --> 00:35:35.635
Now he's looking to the west,
and he wants to go to Spain,

00:35:35.635 --> 00:35:37.849
and so he's going to stop in
Rome.

00:35:37.849 --> 00:35:39.422
Notice how he says,
"I want you to send me

00:35:39.422 --> 00:35:39.800
on."
 

00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:43.300
That Greek actually means that
he's asking them--

00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:45.099
he's asking them for a
financial contribution,

00:35:45.099 --> 00:35:48.760
sending him along is not just,
hey Paul don't let the door hit

00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:50.380
your butt on the way out!
 

00:35:50.380 --> 00:35:52.989
It's sending him along with
money.

00:35:52.989 --> 00:35:56.795
What he's doing is saying,
I want a little contribution

00:35:56.795 --> 00:36:01.166
from you so I want some support
from you, both symbolic support

00:36:01.166 --> 00:36:03.000
and financial support.
 

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.856
That's what he's--he's writing
to them to talk about his

00:36:05.856 --> 00:36:07.260
further mission to Spain.
 

00:36:07.260 --> 00:36:10.177
He's writing to them also
because Rome is the center of

00:36:10.177 --> 00:36:12.768
the earth for the Romans and for
many people,

00:36:12.768 --> 00:36:16.719
and so he's the Apostle to the
Gentiles of the whole earth.

00:36:16.719 --> 00:36:19.112
So what more likely place for
him to go than to Rome,

00:36:19.112 --> 00:36:21.000
at least sometime,
on his way to Spain.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:24.389
That's one thing he's doing.
 

00:36:24.389 --> 00:36:33.199
We'll keep reading there at
15:25.

00:36:33.199 --> 00:36:35.516
"At present,
however, I am going to

00:36:35.516 --> 00:36:38.250
Jerusalem in a ministry to the
saints."

00:36:38.250 --> 00:36:42.815
A liturgy, he's taking some
help to what he calls "the

00:36:42.815 --> 00:36:45.018
saints" in Jerusalem.
 

00:36:45.018 --> 00:36:47.257
"The saints"
just means "the holy

00:36:47.257 --> 00:36:50.018
ones," he's probably
talking about believing Jews,

00:36:50.018 --> 00:36:52.568
Jews in Judean Jerusalem who
believe that Jesus is the

00:36:52.568 --> 00:36:53.050
Messiah.
 

00:36:53.050 --> 00:36:56.280
So he's taking them some kind
of help too.

00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:59.621
For Macedonia and Achaea
[remember his churches in

00:36:59.621 --> 00:37:02.690
Philippi and Thessalonica or in
Macedonia,

00:37:02.690 --> 00:37:04.989
his church in Corinth is in
Achaea]

00:37:04.989 --> 00:37:08.710
have been pleased to share
their resources with the poor

00:37:08.710 --> 00:37:11.010
among the saints in Jerusalem.
 

00:37:11.010 --> 00:37:13.559
They were pleased to do this,
and indeed they owe it to them.

00:37:13.559 --> 00:37:16.079
For the Gentiles have come to
share in their spiritual

00:37:16.079 --> 00:37:19.027
blessings, they also ought to be
of service to them in material

00:37:19.027 --> 00:37:19.550
things.
 

00:37:19.550 --> 00:37:22.795
He's taking money that he's
been collecting in his different

00:37:22.795 --> 00:37:25.878
churches that are Gentiles
churches back as a gift to the

00:37:25.878 --> 00:37:28.190
poor followers of Jesus in
Jerusalem,

00:37:28.190 --> 00:37:29.050
the Jews.
 

00:37:29.050 --> 00:37:31.289
So when I have completed this
and have delivered to them

00:37:31.289 --> 00:37:33.572
what--has been collected,
I will set out by way of you to

00:37:33.572 --> 00:37:33.980
Spain.
 

00:37:33.980 --> 00:37:36.844
And I know that when I come I
will come in the fullness of the

00:37:36.844 --> 00:37:37.829
blessing of Christ.
 

00:37:37.829 --> 00:37:41.211
This collection was much more
important to Paul than a lot of

00:37:41.211 --> 00:37:43.130
modern Christians seem to think.
 

00:37:43.130 --> 00:37:46.268
It's just kind of--all churches
take up money.

00:37:46.268 --> 00:37:50.994
But remember Paul had agreed
when he met in Jerusalem with

00:37:50.994 --> 00:37:52.481
Peter,
James, and John,

00:37:52.481 --> 00:37:54.336
and other people,
that he would go to the

00:37:54.336 --> 00:37:55.768
Gentiles,
and they didn't have to

00:37:55.768 --> 00:37:56.670
circumcise the Gentiles.
 

00:37:56.670 --> 00:37:57.840
Peter would go to the Jews.
 

00:37:57.840 --> 00:38:01.099
The one thing they said was,
remember the poor.

00:38:01.099 --> 00:38:05.500
And so this was interpreted
that in the different churches

00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:08.280
that Paul founded among
non-Jews,

00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:11.512
he would continue to take up
financial contributions to send

00:38:11.512 --> 00:38:12.610
back to Jerusalem.
 

00:38:12.610 --> 00:38:14.402
This was partly,
just of course,

00:38:14.402 --> 00:38:15.849
they were poorer there.
 

00:38:15.849 --> 00:38:20.038
But it's also apparently seen
by Paul as very symbolically

00:38:20.038 --> 00:38:20.920
important.
 

00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:23.614
The giving of money from the
Gentile churches to the

00:38:23.614 --> 00:38:26.679
Jerusalem churches would be an
acknowledgement by them,

00:38:26.679 --> 00:38:30.440
by the Gentiles,
of the somewhat superiority,

00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:33.039
at least in time in the Gospel.
 

00:38:33.039 --> 00:38:35.250
They got their Gospel from the
Jews;

00:38:35.250 --> 00:38:39.577
it's an acknowledgement of the
importance and the centrality of

00:38:39.577 --> 00:38:42.440
Jews in the Jesus movement by
Gentiles.

00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:44.840
It's also reciprocal.
 

00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:47.588
Remember I talked about--we
talked about the patron client

00:38:47.588 --> 00:38:50.336
structures and we've talked
about gifts, and people giving

00:38:50.336 --> 00:38:51.639
things to other people.
 

00:38:51.639 --> 00:38:54.172
In the ancient world the whole
patron client structure was very

00:38:54.172 --> 00:38:56.010
much centered around giving and
receiving,

00:38:56.010 --> 00:38:59.177
so if I give you something
you're indebted to me and if you

00:38:59.177 --> 00:39:02.730
don't want to be shamed you have
to give something back to me,

00:39:02.730 --> 00:39:05.699
so giving and receiving is
always a very important issue

00:39:05.699 --> 00:39:08.885
with status and relationships
and friendships in the ancient

00:39:08.885 --> 00:39:10.925
world,
whether you're talking about

00:39:10.925 --> 00:39:12.989
equals or people on different
statuses.

00:39:12.989 --> 00:39:15.884
Paul is setting up the
relationship between the Judean

00:39:15.884 --> 00:39:17.702
churches,
predominantly Jewish,

00:39:17.702 --> 00:39:21.079
and his Gentile churches that
he's founded as something like a

00:39:21.079 --> 00:39:24.123
patron client structure where
the Jews gave the Gentiles

00:39:24.123 --> 00:39:26.300
something,
the Gospel;

00:39:26.300 --> 00:39:30.213
now the Gentiles owe it to the
Jewish followers to give them

00:39:30.213 --> 00:39:31.010
something.
 

00:39:31.010 --> 00:39:32.730
So he's taking this collection.
 

00:39:32.730 --> 00:39:35.597
Paul has talked about this
collection in several of his

00:39:35.597 --> 00:39:37.721
letters, it's been very
important to him,

00:39:37.721 --> 00:39:40.429
and so he's on his way to
Jerusalem to do this.

00:39:40.429 --> 00:39:41.679
But now notice what happens.
 

00:39:41.679 --> 00:39:46.101
We know a little bit about
Paul's last trip to Jerusalem as

00:39:46.101 --> 00:39:47.780
is depicted in Acts.
 

00:39:47.780 --> 00:39:49.739
How does Acts portray this?
 

00:39:49.739 --> 00:39:51.987
Paul goes to Jerusalem,
he's got some Gentiles with

00:39:51.987 --> 00:39:53.829
him, he's got some other Jews
with him.

00:39:53.829 --> 00:39:57.409
He goes to the temple purely to
pray, to be a good Jew.

00:39:57.409 --> 00:39:58.887
Other people,
non-believing Jews,

00:39:58.887 --> 00:40:00.965
see him there,
and they think that he's trying

00:40:00.965 --> 00:40:02.719
to bring Gentiles into the
temple.

00:40:02.719 --> 00:40:05.728
So he's arrested,
he's tried, and then he has to

00:40:05.728 --> 00:40:08.610
eventually appeal to Caesar to
get to Rome.

00:40:08.610 --> 00:40:12.150
What does Acts tell us about
the collection?

00:40:12.150 --> 00:40:17.599
What happened to the collection
in Acts?

00:40:17.599 --> 00:40:19.469
We don't know.
 

00:40:19.469 --> 00:40:24.409
The writer of Acts may have
known about this collection.

00:40:24.409 --> 00:40:26.673
It was certainly one of the
most important things to Paul in

00:40:26.673 --> 00:40:27.250
his ministry.
 

00:40:27.250 --> 00:40:28.750
The writer of Acts tells us
nothing.

00:40:28.750 --> 00:40:30.666
Notice also,
Paul seems to be a little

00:40:30.666 --> 00:40:32.789
nervous if you read between the
lines,

00:40:32.789 --> 00:40:36.360
because what happens if he's
collected all this money and he

00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:39.510
takes it to Jerusalem and the
Jewish leaders say,

00:40:39.510 --> 00:40:43.027
Paul do you know what kind of
rumors have been flying about

00:40:43.027 --> 00:40:45.150
what you're saying about the
law?

00:40:45.150 --> 00:40:46.670
Do you know what we've heard?
 

00:40:46.670 --> 00:40:49.139
We're not going to take your
money;

00:40:49.139 --> 00:40:53.139
we're not going to justify your
activities.

00:40:53.139 --> 00:40:57.742
I think Paul was concerned that
the Jerusalem churches wouldn't

00:40:57.742 --> 00:41:01.532
take his money,
and that would be catastrophic

00:41:01.532 --> 00:41:05.050
for his vision of having a
united church,

00:41:05.050 --> 00:41:07.510
that included both Jews and
Gentiles.

00:41:07.510 --> 00:41:12.907
He writes to the Romans partly
because he's going to Spain and

00:41:12.907 --> 00:41:18.750
he wants to prepare the ground
for a trip to Rome and to Spain,

00:41:18.750 --> 00:41:22.496
but also he goes so carefully
to explain what he really

00:41:22.496 --> 00:41:25.550
believes about the law and
justification,

00:41:25.550 --> 00:41:29.260
because I think,
he's afraid of what may happen

00:41:29.260 --> 00:41:30.469
in Jerusalem.
 

00:41:30.469 --> 00:41:32.784
He's, in a sense,
trying to get the Roman

00:41:32.784 --> 00:41:35.909
Christians on his side before
his trip to Jerusalem.

00:41:35.909 --> 00:41:41.219
That takes us to what's become
a new interpretation of Romans.

00:41:41.219 --> 00:41:43.630
I'm going to do this quickly
and we can talk about it maybe

00:41:43.630 --> 00:41:45.945
more after the break,
but the traditional

00:41:45.945 --> 00:41:50.099
interpretation of Romans was
that this was Paul's theological

00:41:50.099 --> 00:41:50.929
treatise.
 

00:41:50.929 --> 00:41:53.219
It didn't have much of anything
to do with the circumstances.

00:41:53.219 --> 00:41:55.603
Paul just kind of decided he
was going to Rome,

00:41:55.603 --> 00:41:58.556
so he sits down and he says,
what's really my Gospel in 16

00:41:58.556 --> 00:41:59.230
chapters?
 

00:41:59.230 --> 00:42:02.884
He writes it up;
he sends it to the churches in

00:42:02.884 --> 00:42:05.059
Rome to present my Gospel to
them.

00:42:05.059 --> 00:42:07.639
This is sort of a theological
treatise,

00:42:07.639 --> 00:42:10.177
and the main point of the
treatise is: you're not

00:42:10.177 --> 00:42:13.550
justified by works of law,
by any works no matter which

00:42:13.550 --> 00:42:16.969
law, you're justified by grace
through faith alone.

00:42:16.969 --> 00:42:18.865
The big Protestant,
the Lutheran,

00:42:18.865 --> 00:42:22.599
the Calvinist reading of Romans
set Romans as the center book of

00:42:22.599 --> 00:42:24.985
the Bible,
and it's thought that what it's

00:42:24.985 --> 00:42:26.869
mainly about is individual
salvation,

00:42:26.869 --> 00:42:28.659
your personal salvation.
 

00:42:28.659 --> 00:42:31.402
You need to recognize that you
won't be saved by your works,

00:42:31.402 --> 00:42:32.380
by anything you do.
 

00:42:32.380 --> 00:42:33.980
Not only you're not saved by
Jewish law;

00:42:33.980 --> 00:42:35.550
you're not saved by Roman
Catholic rules,

00:42:35.550 --> 00:42:38.159
you're not saved by any law,
you're saved by putting your

00:42:38.159 --> 00:42:40.612
faith in Jesus,
accepting Jesus as your Lord

00:42:40.612 --> 00:42:43.170
and personal Savior,
or something like that.

00:42:43.170 --> 00:42:45.494
It's individual salvation,
and it's a doctrine of

00:42:45.494 --> 00:42:48.257
individual salvation by faith
that's the reason Paul wrote

00:42:48.257 --> 00:42:48.789
Romans.
 

00:42:48.789 --> 00:42:51.260
And that's what its central
message is: very

00:42:51.260 --> 00:42:53.043
individualistic,
very doctrinal,

00:42:53.043 --> 00:42:54.250
very theological.
 

00:42:54.250 --> 00:42:57.628
That reading of Romans has been
severely challenged in the last

00:42:57.628 --> 00:42:58.719
forty years or so.
 

00:42:58.719 --> 00:43:01.773
Now people are starting to say
it's not the first few chapters

00:43:01.773 --> 00:43:04.929
of Romans that constitute the
most important part of Romans,

00:43:04.929 --> 00:43:06.420
which has always been the
Protestant interpretation,

00:43:06.420 --> 00:43:09.153
because that's where Paul talks
doctrinally about justification

00:43:09.153 --> 00:43:09.639
by faith.
 

00:43:09.639 --> 00:43:13.969
Scholars have said now,
look to the end of Romans,

00:43:13.969 --> 00:43:16.980
chapter 9-11 the latter part of
Romans,

00:43:16.980 --> 00:43:20.469
that's where you'll see what
the real point of Romans is,

00:43:20.469 --> 00:43:22.400
and it's not about individual
salvation.

00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:25.280
It's about the relationship
between the nations--

00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:27.666
when I say "Gentiles"
remember that's just a term

00:43:27.666 --> 00:43:29.969
that Jews used for all the
nations except themselves,

00:43:29.969 --> 00:43:31.514
so when I say "the
nations"

00:43:31.514 --> 00:43:33.789
I mean all non-Jewish peoples
in the ancient world.

00:43:33.789 --> 00:43:34.954
That's the way the Gentiles
[correction: Jews]

00:43:34.954 --> 00:43:35.369
used the term.
 

00:43:35.369 --> 00:43:38.431
In fact, "Gentiles"
is just sort of Latinized

00:43:38.431 --> 00:43:41.380
translation of the Greek work
"nations."

00:43:41.380 --> 00:43:42.994
When you see
"Gentiles"

00:43:42.994 --> 00:43:45.010
in Paul's text,
read "nations,"

00:43:45.010 --> 00:43:47.079
they refer to the non-Jewish
nations.

00:43:47.079 --> 00:43:50.318
What's the relationship of the
nations to Israel and the God of

00:43:50.318 --> 00:43:50.789
Israel?
 

00:43:50.789 --> 00:43:52.440
Look at a few places.
 

00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:56.137
In chapter 9 Paul basically
gives this apocalyptic

00:43:56.137 --> 00:43:58.851
expectation,
he even quotes Hosea saying,

00:43:58.851 --> 00:44:02.469
"The people who are not my
people will be my people."

00:44:02.469 --> 00:44:05.195
In other words,
again Paul's quoting Jewish

00:44:05.195 --> 00:44:09.286
scripture to enforce his belief
that at the end of time Gentiles

00:44:09.286 --> 00:44:12.856
would become people of God and
this was common in Jewish

00:44:12.856 --> 00:44:14.349
apocalyptic idea.
 

00:44:14.349 --> 00:44:17.302
The basic scenario was,
the Messiah's going to come at

00:44:17.302 --> 00:44:17.860
the end.
 

00:44:17.860 --> 00:44:22.420
The Messiah will bring in--will
overthrow the oppressors of the

00:44:22.420 --> 00:44:24.793
Jews,
and the Messiah will bring in

00:44:24.793 --> 00:44:26.963
all the other nations,
all the nations,

00:44:26.963 --> 00:44:28.179
the Egyptians,
the Greeks,

00:44:28.179 --> 00:44:30.639
the Romans will all come to the
temple in Jerusalem.

00:44:30.639 --> 00:44:33.172
They'll bring gifts;
they'll all worship the God of

00:44:33.172 --> 00:44:33.550
Israel.
 

00:44:33.550 --> 00:44:36.719
You find this in Isaiah;
you find it in Hosea.

00:44:36.719 --> 00:44:40.652
So Jewish scripture itself gave
Jews of Paul's day the idea that

00:44:40.652 --> 00:44:43.960
the apocalyptic end would bring
all the nations in.

00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:47.588
The Messiah had already come
for Paul, so that's why he seems

00:44:47.588 --> 00:44:50.130
himself as going to get the
Gentiles in.

00:44:50.130 --> 00:44:54.019
His whole mission is part of
this end time scenario.

00:44:54.019 --> 00:44:55.000
What does that mean?
 

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:58.378
Look at Romans 11:13:
I'm speaking to you Gentiles,

00:44:58.378 --> 00:45:00.371
[so he turns directly to the
Romans]

00:45:00.371 --> 00:45:03.500
in as much then as I am an
Apostle of the Gentiles,

00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:06.456
I glorify my ministry in order
to make my own people jealous

00:45:06.456 --> 00:45:07.909
and thus save some of them.
 

00:45:07.909 --> 00:45:10.469
For if their rejection is the
reconciliation of the world,

00:45:10.469 --> 00:45:12.940
what will their acceptance be
but life from the dead?

00:45:12.940 --> 00:45:16.655
If a part of dough offered as
first fruits is holy,

00:45:16.655 --> 00:45:18.960
then the whole batch is holy.
 

00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:21.110
If the root is holy then the
branches are also holy.

00:45:21.110 --> 00:45:23.280
Paul gives a theology here of
the remnant.

00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:26.663
Some of the--a lot of the Jews
have not accepted that Jesus is

00:45:26.663 --> 00:45:27.440
the Messiah.
 

00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:30.565
Therefore, they seem to be cut
off, they're like branches of an

00:45:30.565 --> 00:45:32.079
olive tree that are cut off.
 

00:45:32.079 --> 00:45:33.974
And the Gentiles,
who are not natural branches of

00:45:33.974 --> 00:45:35.594
the olive tree,
have been grafted in their

00:45:35.594 --> 00:45:35.989
place.
 

00:45:35.989 --> 00:45:38.409
That means that they're part of
Israel now.

00:45:38.409 --> 00:45:39.849
Notice what this means.
 

00:45:39.849 --> 00:45:43.454
That you may not claim to be
wiser than you are brothers and

00:45:43.454 --> 00:45:46.449
sisters, I want you to
understand this mystery.

00:45:46.449 --> 00:45:50.512
A hardening has come upon part
of Israel [some of the Jews

00:45:50.512 --> 00:45:53.507
don't believe]
until the full number of the

00:45:53.507 --> 00:45:55.289
Gentiles has come in.
 

00:45:55.289 --> 00:45:59.119
[That's his job is trying to
bring in the full number of the

00:45:59.119 --> 00:46:01.389
Gentiles.]
And so all Israel will be

00:46:01.389 --> 00:46:02.039
saved.
 

00:46:02.039 --> 00:46:05.159
Wow, all Israel?
 

00:46:05.159 --> 00:46:08.268
Notice he doesn't explain how
this happens,

00:46:08.268 --> 00:46:11.617
but in Romans 9-11 Paul
presents this magnificent

00:46:11.617 --> 00:46:15.731
scenario that he believes was
prophesied in Jewish scripture

00:46:15.731 --> 00:46:16.500
itself.
 

00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:20.010
That at the end of this cosmos,
the end of this world,

00:46:20.010 --> 00:46:22.753
the Messiah would come,
overthrow the oppressors of the

00:46:22.753 --> 00:46:24.822
Jews,
set up Jerusalem as the center

00:46:24.822 --> 00:46:25.599
of the earth.
 

00:46:25.599 --> 00:46:27.760
And then all the Gentiles,
all the nations,

00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:30.862
would come to the God of
Israel, they would be grafted

00:46:30.862 --> 00:46:33.891
into the nation of Israel,
they would worship the God of

00:46:33.891 --> 00:46:34.260
Israel.
 

00:46:34.260 --> 00:46:38.460
Paul's addition to this myth is
simply that you don't need to

00:46:38.460 --> 00:46:40.909
keep the law in order to do
this.

00:46:40.909 --> 00:46:45.150
All that Paul is saying about
the law is secondary to his main

00:46:45.150 --> 00:46:48.280
point, which is,
you're now part of Israel.

00:46:48.280 --> 00:46:52.340
Paul is not about starting a
new religion.

00:46:52.340 --> 00:46:53.885
There's no
"Christianity"

00:46:53.885 --> 00:46:54.340
in Paul.
 

00:46:54.340 --> 00:46:56.594
There are no
"Christians"

00:46:56.594 --> 00:46:57.920
in Paul's letters.
 

00:46:57.920 --> 00:46:58.940
You can't find the word.
 

00:46:58.940 --> 00:47:00.289
You can't find the concept.
 

00:47:00.289 --> 00:47:01.657
There's no
"Christianity"

00:47:01.657 --> 00:47:03.429
or "Christians"
in Paul's world.

00:47:03.429 --> 00:47:08.005
He believed that he was the
Apostle to the Gentiles to bring

00:47:08.005 --> 00:47:12.268
them into Israel to make the
Gentiles part of Israel.

00:47:12.268 --> 00:47:15.719
Then, as he says right here,
most wildly along he somehow

00:47:15.719 --> 00:47:17.371
believes,
although he doesn't tell us how

00:47:17.371 --> 00:47:19.730
it's going to happen,
that somehow God and God's

00:47:19.730 --> 00:47:23.478
miraculous mercy is going to
figure out a way in the end to

00:47:23.478 --> 00:47:26.130
even bring all of Israel back in
also.

00:47:26.130 --> 00:47:30.199
All Israel, he says,
will be saved.

00:47:30.199 --> 00:47:34.880
Paul's not necessarily the
first Christian theologian.

00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:39.619
He's one of the most radical
Jewish theologians in the

00:47:39.619 --> 00:47:41.050
ancient world.
 

00:47:41.050 --> 00:47:46.210
Okay, we'll stop now and papers
will be handed out.

00:47:46.210 --> 00:47:48.519
You all come up here to hand
out the papers.

00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:06.860
Prof: Ok,
I want to talk about Peter the

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:08.480
Great today.
 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.650
The Russian empire is one of
those empires that continued,

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.650
arguably--;not arguably,
it was the case--after the four

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.310
empires disappeared with World
War I.

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:25.020
The Russian empire continues,
though it continues under a

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:30.730
very different way with what
became the Soviet empire.

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.050
That's what it became.
 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:40.890
With the end of the Soviet
Union in 1991-92,

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.730
the Soviet Empire collapsed,
the Soviet Union collapses,

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.226
and I guess the only remaining
empire in the world is that of

00:00:48.226 --> 00:00:50.635
the United States,
which is a more informal

00:00:50.635 --> 00:00:52.991
empire,
but still one that is out there

00:00:52.991 --> 00:00:56.320
almost everywhere with the
military bases everywhere.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:01.213
So, the rise and fall of
empires is obviously a theme of

00:01:01.213 --> 00:01:02.460
this course.
 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.025
The Russian empire,
the state of Muscovy had

00:01:06.025 --> 00:01:09.972
already expanded greatly,
but it's really Peter the

00:01:09.972 --> 00:01:14.653
Great,
it's the big guy who expanded

00:01:14.653 --> 00:01:20.188
Russia,
its territorial size enormously.

00:01:20.188 --> 00:01:26.435
Muscovy had been one of the
tributaries of the Mongols,

00:01:26.435 --> 00:01:33.144
who sacked Kiev in the 1230s,
after pouring into Russia and

00:01:33.144 --> 00:01:35.920
what now is Ukraine.
 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.780
Muscovy was a princely state.
 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.854
It gradually expanded in size,
reaching to the Southern Ural

00:01:45.854 --> 00:01:50.670
Mountains and the Caspian Sea,
and emerging as a dynastic

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:51.530
state.
 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.397
But yet Muscovy was
considerably less important than

00:01:55.397 --> 00:01:58.430
the commonwealth of
Poland-Lithuania,

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:05.094
which was considerably much
greater and subject to struggles

00:02:05.094 --> 00:02:09.050
with and influence by that
state.

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:16.026
What Peter the Great did was he
pushed back the neighbors who

00:02:16.026 --> 00:02:22.538
had blocked the expansion of
Muscovy, that is Sweden,

00:02:22.538 --> 00:02:27.780
who he defeats in a battle
worth noting in Poltava,

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:33.508
it's in the book, 1709,
Poland and the Ottoman Turks.

00:02:33.508 --> 00:02:37.110
Peter the Great expands
territory beyond the Euro

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.759
mountains along the Caspian Sea
at the expense of the Turks.

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:46.342
Like all of his successors,
he dreamed of conquering the

00:02:46.342 --> 00:02:48.970
Turkish capital of
Constantinople,

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.967
that is, Istanbul,
which would have given him

00:02:53.967 --> 00:03:00.580
control of the Dardanelles
Straits there,

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.120
the passage between Europe and
Asia leading to the Black Sea.

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.563
All this stuff really matters,
because all these events now

00:03:08.563 --> 00:03:10.939
with the problems in Georgia.
 

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:15.349
That's a very, very delicate,
strange situation,

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:18.330
where the great power now,
the United States,

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.167
finds itself rather
incongruously arguing that

00:03:21.167 --> 00:03:24.431
Kosovo--which should be,
obviously, independent--I

00:03:24.431 --> 00:03:28.307
remember going to Pec in Kosovo
when I was a kid--It's a little

00:03:28.307 --> 00:03:32.308
hard to argue that Kosovo should
be independent and that what was

00:03:32.308 --> 00:03:36.060
the territorial unit of Serbia
should not be respected.

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.810
I agree with this,
Kosovo should be independent.

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.680
And to argue that Tibet should
be free, and I agree with that.

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.966
Then to turn around and argue
that the people in Georgia,

00:03:45.966 --> 00:03:49.075
who are not Georgians,
should not have the same rights

00:03:49.075 --> 00:03:51.128
that the people in Kosovo have.
 

00:03:51.128 --> 00:03:54.164
The whole thing--;the
presentation in the press is

00:03:54.164 --> 00:03:56.830
absolutely hypocritical and just
bizarre.

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:59.980
But the only point of that
little diatribe in parentheses

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:03.188
was that the Black Sea really
does still matter a lot,

00:04:03.188 --> 00:04:08.540
and that Peter the Great was
the first of the Russian czars

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:13.985
to dream of this access on to
the Black Sea and then finally

00:04:13.985 --> 00:04:18.230
controlling the Straits of
Constantinople.

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:21.166
And Catherine the Great--they
all like to call themselves

00:04:21.166 --> 00:04:24.420
"the Great"--She would
make this an important part of

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:26.774
her policy,
but she doesn't get there

00:04:26.774 --> 00:04:27.259
either.
 

00:04:27.259 --> 00:04:32.285
In the nineteenth century,
the Russian czars are still

00:04:32.285 --> 00:04:35.129
trying to get there as well.
 

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:38.139
Peter's new fleet,
we'll talk about his new fleet,

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:40.670
which he oversaw and,
in a very minor way,

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:45.230
helped build himself,
sails down the Don River in

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:50.389
1698 and takes the Turkish port
of Azov, A-Z-O-V,

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:54.259
on the Sea of Azov.
 

00:04:54.259 --> 00:04:56.779
This gave them access to the
Black Sea.

00:04:56.779 --> 00:04:59.110
But then they're forced to back
up.

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:04.637
They lose, and they're forced
to surrender Azov to the Turks

00:05:04.637 --> 00:05:07.259
after an unsuccessful war.
 

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:13.422
So, Peter the Great,
despite his dramatic expansion

00:05:13.422 --> 00:05:19.954
of the Russian empire,
does not get this outlet on the

00:05:19.954 --> 00:05:21.680
Black Sea.
 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:25.235
But what does change,
and what the battle represents

00:05:25.235 --> 00:05:28.079
is, of course,
Poltava--is that Russia's

00:05:28.079 --> 00:05:31.942
participation in European
affairs had been totally

00:05:31.942 --> 00:05:32.810
minimal.
 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:36.295
There's a story often told,
indeed told in the book that

00:05:36.295 --> 00:05:39.288
you're kind enough to read,
that--I think it was Louis

00:05:39.288 --> 00:05:43.004
XIV's equivalent of minister of
foreign affairs--sends a formal

00:05:43.004 --> 00:05:46.720
letter to a Russian czar--it
couldn't have been Louis XIV,

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:50.291
but one of those dudes--it
might have been--he sends a

00:05:50.291 --> 00:05:53.930
letter to a czar who had been
dead for twelve years.

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:56.410
Russia was that far away.
 

00:05:56.410 --> 00:06:01.949
It was not in the consciousness
of the great powers.

00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:05.579
But after one of Peter's
victories,

00:06:05.579 --> 00:06:08.826
the Russian ambassador in
Vienna reported that the news of

00:06:08.826 --> 00:06:12.504
Peter's victory,
people began to fear the czar

00:06:12.504 --> 00:06:15.370
as they feared Sweden formerly.
 

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:19.250
It's very difficult for us to
imagine a fear of Sweden.

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:25.060
But that fear--the last
real--Gustavus Adolphus,

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:29.529
during the Thirty Years' War,
was the last really major

00:06:29.529 --> 00:06:33.610
Swedish interlude in the
continental European affairs,

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:41.077
although Poltava doesn't come
until 1709, so

00:06:41.077 --> 00:06:44.899
voilÃ .
 

00:06:44.899 --> 00:06:51.142
But what he does is that
there's no other European state

00:06:51.142 --> 00:06:55.230
expanding their empires
overseas,

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:57.569
in the case of the Spanish and
the English,

00:06:57.569 --> 00:07:03.459
that adds so much territory on
land to its empire.

00:07:03.459 --> 00:07:09.713
Between the 1620s and the
1740s, the land of the Russian

00:07:09.713 --> 00:07:15.627
empire increases from 2.1
million square miles to 5.9

00:07:15.627 --> 00:07:18.470
million square miles.
 

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:22.458
Now, to be sure,
in Siberia in the far reaches

00:07:22.458 --> 00:07:24.860
of the north,
North Asia,

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:28.721
this empire amounted to little
more than a series of trading

00:07:28.721 --> 00:07:30.841
posts,
and it took a very long time

00:07:30.841 --> 00:07:34.014
for any semblance of Russian
authority from Moscow and soon

00:07:34.014 --> 00:07:34.452
from St.
 

00:07:34.452 --> 00:07:37.680
Petersburg, for reasons that
we'll see, to reach there.

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:40.478
But nonetheless,
Peter the Great creates this

00:07:40.478 --> 00:07:43.343
huge empire that will have,
over the long run,

00:07:43.343 --> 00:07:46.269
an enormous influence in
European affairs.

00:07:46.269 --> 00:07:50.863
Because, after all,
European Russia is part of

00:07:50.863 --> 00:07:57.091
Europe and will have an enormous
influence on Asian affairs as

00:07:57.091 --> 00:07:58.009
well.
 

00:07:58.009 --> 00:08:03.660
Witness the Russo-Japanese War
in 1904-1905 that the Russians

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:04.319
lose.
 

00:08:04.319 --> 00:08:10.031
This is a key moment in the
evolution of revolutionary

00:08:10.031 --> 00:08:15.959
politics in Russia as we shall
see a little later on.

00:08:15.959 --> 00:08:17.490
Now, what about Peter the Great?
 

00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:19.952
I used to ask my friend Paul
Bushkovitch to come in and give

00:08:19.952 --> 00:08:23.408
the lecture,
and I got so interested in it

00:08:23.408 --> 00:08:29.362
that I did some reading on my
own---Lindsey Hughes and various

00:08:29.362 --> 00:08:35.412
other people put this together
last semester--because he is not

00:08:35.412 --> 00:08:41.168
a terribly engaging or warm
personality in many ways,

00:08:41.168 --> 00:08:43.649
since he enjoyed watching
people being tortured,

00:08:43.649 --> 00:08:47.139
including his own son;
but, he is an interesting

00:08:47.139 --> 00:08:47.789
person.
 

00:08:47.789 --> 00:08:50.292
One of the things he does,
and I guess this is one of the

00:08:50.292 --> 00:08:52.409
things to be put in neon from
this lecture,

00:08:52.409 --> 00:08:59.551
is he opens up Russia,
which had no secular influences

00:08:59.551 --> 00:09:03.408
at all, to western ideas.
 

00:09:03.408 --> 00:09:08.443
This is an extraordinarily
important and transforming

00:09:08.443 --> 00:09:11.928
accomplishment of Peter the
Great.

00:09:11.928 --> 00:09:15.809
He emerges from the violent
world of Boyars.

00:09:15.809 --> 00:09:18.706
Boyars are the nobles;
the Junkers are the Prussian

00:09:18.706 --> 00:09:19.110
nobles.
 

00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:23.019
Boyars, B-O-Y-A-R,
are the Russian nobles and

00:09:23.019 --> 00:09:24.528
royal politics.
 

00:09:24.528 --> 00:09:28.614
Peter was the first child of
his father's second wife and

00:09:28.614 --> 00:09:33.135
thus a potential threat to the
ambition of the relatives of the

00:09:33.135 --> 00:09:34.230
first wife.
 

00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:39.241
His mother and her allies among
the Boyars, that is the nobles,

00:09:39.241 --> 00:09:41.830
overthrew the regents in 1689.
 

00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:48.320
Peter's rule is from 1682 until
his death in 1725.

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:52.470
There were no strict rules for
the succession of the czar.

00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:58.150
It's basically just kind of an
uncomely family battle royal,

00:09:58.150 --> 00:10:02.870
in which there were bloody
settlings of scores.

00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:05.740
There was no foreign minister.
 

00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:09.157
The Boyars' counsel,
that is the counsel of the

00:10:09.157 --> 00:10:13.019
nobles, literally met in the
throne of the palace.

00:10:13.019 --> 00:10:15.129
It became known as the Duma.
 

00:10:15.129 --> 00:10:20.208
Eventually in 1905,
Nicholas II will be forced to

00:10:20.208 --> 00:10:24.230
grant a Duma,
an assembly to Russia.

00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:28.344
Then he withdraws,
eliminates basically all of its

00:10:28.344 --> 00:10:32.710
rights, and then the Duma will
come back later on.

00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:36.938
Peter is one of those cases in
European history where one

00:10:36.938 --> 00:10:41.017
person's personality and
interest does make an enormous

00:10:41.017 --> 00:10:42.149
difference.
 

00:10:42.149 --> 00:10:43.840
He is an absolute ruler.
 

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:46.158
He can do what he damn well
pleases.

00:10:46.158 --> 00:10:50.210
He is personally responsible
for the reforms,

00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:55.640
the opening up of Russia to a
considerable extent to western

00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:57.389
European ideas.
 

00:10:57.389 --> 00:11:00.009
This is something that he does
himself.

00:11:00.009 --> 00:11:03.658
As a boy, he was very smart and
he was very interested in

00:11:03.658 --> 00:11:04.308
science.
 

00:11:04.308 --> 00:11:06.629
He always wanted to know how
things worked.

00:11:06.629 --> 00:11:11.058
He was fascinated with
astrolabes and was interested in

00:11:11.058 --> 00:11:11.879
sailing.
 

00:11:11.879 --> 00:11:14.330
Russia doesn't have a port.
 

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:18.650
He's interested in sailing and
learns about sailing on lakes,

00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:20.379
and ponds, and rivers.
 

00:11:20.379 --> 00:11:24.250
It does have a port,
but it's frozen all the time.

00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:27.549
His travels took him into
contact with observatories,

00:11:27.549 --> 00:11:30.090
museums, hospitals,
botanical gardens.

00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:31.960
He's fascinated by gardens.
 

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:35.191
When he goes to Europe on his
big sortie,

00:11:35.191 --> 00:11:39.042
on his big-boy trek through
Europe, he goes around and he

00:11:39.042 --> 00:11:41.929
visits all of these botanical
gardens.

00:11:41.929 --> 00:11:42.899
He sketches things.
 

00:11:42.899 --> 00:11:45.544
He's constantly sketching the
way things work,

00:11:45.544 --> 00:11:46.779
the way things are.
 

00:11:46.779 --> 00:11:51.169
He had this intellectual
curiosity that defied the kind

00:11:51.169 --> 00:11:55.884
of orthodox religious skepticism
about any kind of rational

00:11:55.884 --> 00:11:56.779
belief.
 

00:11:56.779 --> 00:11:59.720
This permeated not only the
Russian Orthodox Church,

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:02.428
but it permeates the Catholic
Church as well.

00:12:02.428 --> 00:12:07.945
Look what happens to Galileo,
who was lucky enough to have

00:12:07.945 --> 00:12:12.879
been burned at the stake by his
friend, the pope.

00:12:12.879 --> 00:12:17.554
He was interested in math and
in geography,

00:12:17.554 --> 00:12:21.340
and thus in maps and map
making.

00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:25.580
What he does is he takes this
archaic state structure in which

00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:28.500
literally nothing had been
written down.

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:31.700
It's all just passed down from
word to mouth.

00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:37.230
He transforms Russia into an
European absolute monarchy with

00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:42.480
much in common with Frederick
the Great, with Sweden,

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:44.840
with Austria,
the Austria of the Hapsburgs,

00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:49.629
with Spain, and with France.
 

00:12:49.629 --> 00:12:54.200
He tries not only to copy
European absolutism,

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:57.480
but to open up Russia to
commerce,

00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:01.985
realizing that trade meant
wealth and that wealth meant

00:13:01.985 --> 00:13:06.159
improvements in the lives of the
Russian people.

00:13:06.159 --> 00:13:08.528
More about that in a while.
 

00:13:08.528 --> 00:13:12.730
He makes Russia a military
power.

00:13:12.730 --> 00:13:15.610
Indeed, arguably a modern
military power,

00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:20.072
at least in the seventeenth and
early eighteenth-century sense,

00:13:20.072 --> 00:13:23.529
and he injects European culture
into Russia.

00:13:23.529 --> 00:13:26.296
Now, just as an aside,
but it's one that we'll come

00:13:26.296 --> 00:13:27.808
back to particularly in your
reading,

00:13:27.808 --> 00:13:31.839
the tension in Russia between
an absolute repugnance for

00:13:31.839 --> 00:13:36.014
western influence and the
constant assertion that Russia's

00:13:36.014 --> 00:13:40.264
traditional ways of doing things
are the right way of doing

00:13:40.264 --> 00:13:43.650
things,
long identified with people who

00:13:43.650 --> 00:13:45.860
would be called Slavophiles.
 

00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:49.240
Their tensions with
westernizers would last right

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:52.974
through Russian intellectual
history in the nineteenth

00:13:52.974 --> 00:13:53.820
century.
 

00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:56.408
I remember when I was a student
of one of the biggest classes at

00:13:56.408 --> 00:13:57.970
the University of Michigan--go
blue!

00:13:57.970 --> 00:14:00.761
I am so sad this weekend--it
was Russian intellectual

00:14:00.761 --> 00:14:01.298
history.
 

00:14:01.298 --> 00:14:05.676
We would read the Slavophiles,
and we'd read the westernizers,

00:14:05.676 --> 00:14:09.548
taught by the late scholar of
Russia, Arthur Mendel.

00:14:09.548 --> 00:14:13.041
It was fabulous to read these
people as they debated what will

00:14:13.041 --> 00:14:15.616
happen to Russia,
the kind of westernizers and

00:14:15.616 --> 00:14:16.820
those in between.
 

00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:20.080
A lot of them were writing from
Paris in the nineteenth century.

00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:21.710
Some of them were great,
great writers.

00:14:21.710 --> 00:14:23.379
There was this kind of
intellectual energy.

00:14:23.379 --> 00:14:26.539
But it came down to this theme
that still is so important,

00:14:26.539 --> 00:14:29.760
and was already so important,
which is, what is Russian that

00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:33.490
should be kept uniquely Russian
and closed to outside influence?

00:14:33.490 --> 00:14:37.951
And what is Russian that should
be modified by being open to

00:14:37.951 --> 00:14:42.110
non-religious influences that
come from other places?

00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:46.038
This is not just a uniquely
Russian tale,

00:14:46.038 --> 00:14:47.710
as you can see.
 

00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:49.620
What about Peter himself?
 

00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:53.769
Somebody figured out that he
was at least 6'7".

00:14:53.769 --> 00:14:55.327
Now, that's just huge.
 

00:14:55.327 --> 00:14:57.309
That's tiny in the NBA now.
 

00:14:57.309 --> 00:15:01.221
But the guards,
the "giants,"

00:15:01.221 --> 00:15:04.610
they were called,
who guarded Frederick the Great

00:15:04.610 --> 00:15:08.269
were giants because they were
six feet tall.

00:15:08.269 --> 00:15:15.607
The average person was about
5'3" or 5'4"

00:15:15.607 --> 00:15:17.370
in France.
 

00:15:17.370 --> 00:15:20.302
Napoleon, who was always
considered to be kind of a

00:15:20.302 --> 00:15:22.649
dwarf, a midget,
really wasn't at all.

00:15:22.649 --> 00:15:23.970
He was just sort of corpulent.
 

00:15:23.970 --> 00:15:26.440
He was the average kind of
increasingly corpulent.

00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:30.470
He was the average height of
most people in France.

00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:35.570
Peter the Great was a big guy,
6'7".

00:15:35.570 --> 00:15:39.480
He had extremely small hands,
very small feet,

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:43.558
which meant he sort of lurched
and stumbled sometimes when he

00:15:43.558 --> 00:15:45.614
walked,
particularly because he drank

00:15:45.614 --> 00:15:46.610
enormous quantities.
 

00:15:46.610 --> 00:15:50.841
He had these odd kind of facial
ticks that he couldn't really

00:15:50.841 --> 00:15:51.830
help at all.
 

00:15:51.830 --> 00:15:58.023
We don't have a documentary
showing Peter the Great in

00:15:58.023 --> 00:16:01.528
action, for obvious reasons.
 

00:16:01.528 --> 00:16:05.255
But the people that he visited
when he was snatching huge

00:16:05.255 --> 00:16:08.581
roasts off the table at the
fancy parties in London

00:16:08.581 --> 00:16:12.707
commented on these facial ticks
that he had that would bend his

00:16:12.707 --> 00:16:13.440
face.
 

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:18.370
He had a misshapen lower lip
and his head sometimes when he

00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:22.450
was talking would seem convulsed
to the right.

00:16:22.450 --> 00:16:23.879
It would move to the right all
the time.

00:16:23.879 --> 00:16:25.360
He was so much bigger than
everybody else,

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:29.058
so people really were not taken
aback,

00:16:29.058 --> 00:16:35.739
because this was a time when
physical imperfections were

00:16:35.739 --> 00:16:37.440
commonplace.
 

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:41.323
You couldn't go anywhere
without seeing people who nature

00:16:41.323 --> 00:16:44.793
had given, in many ways,
a very bad deal along with

00:16:44.793 --> 00:16:46.250
crushing poverty.
 

00:16:46.250 --> 00:16:50.691
But the fact that Peter was a
czar and was rather scary in his

00:16:50.691 --> 00:16:54.114
temperament, because he had a
rather bad temper,

00:16:54.114 --> 00:16:57.100
too, meant that he could be
alarming.

00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:58.460
He could be scary.
 

00:16:58.460 --> 00:17:02.370
His generosity was legend,
but so was his cruelty.

00:17:02.370 --> 00:17:07.220
Several times at public
executions in 1698 and 1699,

00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:09.430
he brushed the executioner
away,

00:17:09.430 --> 00:17:11.990
grabbed the axe and did the
dirty work himself,

00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:15.250
chopping off a head or two.
 

00:17:15.250 --> 00:17:19.670
In 1718, he ordered a man kept
alive after being horribly

00:17:19.670 --> 00:17:24.089
tortured, so he could be
tortured some more and suffer as

00:17:24.089 --> 00:17:26.380
long as humanly possible.
 

00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:30.835
All officials from the
chancelleries that he had

00:17:30.835 --> 00:17:36.334
created and all of the officers
were obliged to attend this

00:17:36.334 --> 00:17:40.980
torture scene as a way of
warning them that,

00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:42.578
"You'd better not mess
around."

00:17:42.578 --> 00:17:45.093
Remember, this is a time,
as we'll see in a while,

00:17:45.093 --> 00:17:48.018
where the czar was on the road
a lot, and distances in the

00:17:48.018 --> 00:17:49.660
Russian empire are enormous.
 

00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:51.973
When he is gone from Moscow and
then St.

00:17:51.973 --> 00:17:55.536
Petersburg, there was always
this tendency to have these sort

00:17:55.536 --> 00:17:58.207
of cabales,
to get together and sort of

00:17:58.207 --> 00:17:58.858
plot.
 

00:17:58.858 --> 00:18:02.210
His son has the bad idea of
getting involved in this later,

00:18:02.210 --> 00:18:03.250
as we shall see.
 

00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:07.961
Yet there were incidents that
his merciful side came through

00:18:07.961 --> 00:18:08.759
as well.
 

00:18:08.759 --> 00:18:13.423
But when it came to treason,
he was less likely to be

00:18:13.423 --> 00:18:18.355
merciful, as the case of Alexis,
his ill-fated son would

00:18:18.355 --> 00:18:19.789
demonstrate.
 

00:18:19.789 --> 00:18:21.480
One thing is clear.
 

00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:26.315
Peter the Great had an enormous
ambivalence about his role and

00:18:26.315 --> 00:18:28.058
his image as a czar.
 

00:18:28.058 --> 00:18:31.838
His second wife was a Latvian
peasant maid.

00:18:31.838 --> 00:18:36.804
This horrified the Boyars,
who thought that this was

00:18:36.804 --> 00:18:38.068
unbecoming.
 

00:18:38.068 --> 00:18:42.942
How can you marry a Latvian to
begin with, if you're a Russian

00:18:42.942 --> 00:18:46.140
and marry somebody who was a
commoner?

00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:48.451
He was capable,
and there are a lot of

00:18:48.451 --> 00:18:52.135
paintings of him dressing up and
playing the role of a czar,

00:18:52.135 --> 00:18:54.009
dressing in fancy clothes.
 

00:18:54.009 --> 00:18:57.830
But there are more images of
him identified with horribly

00:18:57.830 --> 00:19:01.448
worn boots with his toes
sometimes sneaking through at

00:19:01.448 --> 00:19:05.680
the end that seemed to reflect
his great personal thrift,

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:09.660
wearing stockings, it was said,
that he darned himself,

00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:14.105
and a battered hat that he kept
on wearing that he had worn at

00:19:14.105 --> 00:19:19.042
the Battle of Poltava in 1709,
complete with a bullet hole

00:19:19.042 --> 00:19:23.828
that supposedly tore through it,
missing his head.

00:19:23.828 --> 00:19:27.109
He liked the company of
ordinary people.

00:19:27.109 --> 00:19:29.160
This was a constant trait.
 

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:32.240
He identified himself with the
Russian people.

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:34.089
More about this in a while.
 

00:19:34.089 --> 00:19:36.279
He avoided carriages.
 

00:19:36.279 --> 00:19:37.720
He liked to walk.
 

00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:41.288
He would leave the carriage
behind, dismissing carriage

00:19:41.288 --> 00:19:44.791
drivers who were more
well-dressed than he was and his

00:19:44.791 --> 00:19:45.519
guards.
 

00:19:45.519 --> 00:19:52.118
He ignored carefully-crafted
seating plans at dinner.

00:19:52.118 --> 00:19:55.846
He jumped from table to table,
eating standing up--he didn't

00:19:55.846 --> 00:19:59.194
like to sit down very much,
his back hurt--;or walking

00:19:59.194 --> 00:19:59.890
around.
 

00:19:59.890 --> 00:20:03.200
He couldn't stay still very
long.

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:06.923
When he was lodged,
he liked living in your basic

00:20:06.923 --> 00:20:09.250
Russian, wooden,
peasant house,

00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:13.440
such as you could find on the
outskirts of Moscow.

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:15.038
One of the things that's very
true about Moscow,

00:20:15.038 --> 00:20:16.358
right into the twentieth
century,

00:20:16.358 --> 00:20:19.923
is that you had all sorts of
peasants living on the edge of

00:20:19.923 --> 00:20:22.319
Moscow living in these wooden
houses.

00:20:22.319 --> 00:20:23.160
He liked that.
 

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:28.036
He said he slept well in these
wooden houses and that probably

00:20:28.036 --> 00:20:32.992
is because of his very unhappy
childhood listening to relatives

00:20:32.992 --> 00:20:37.471
shouting at each other and
plotting to kill each other in

00:20:37.471 --> 00:20:39.069
the big house.
 

00:20:39.069 --> 00:20:40.880
And he never liked Moscow.
 

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:42.450
We'll see more about that in a
minute,

00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:44.964
in part because of its
overwhelming religious influence

00:20:44.964 --> 00:20:49.675
and that's one reason,
besides the quest for a port on

00:20:49.675 --> 00:20:54.779
the sea,
why he builds St. Petersburg

00:20:54.779 --> 00:20:58.757
When traveling abroad,
he refused the fancy lodgings

00:20:58.757 --> 00:21:02.890
that were reserved for such
distinguished visitors.

00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:06.016
In 1717 in Paris,
Lindsey Hughes reports,

00:21:06.016 --> 00:21:10.548
he went to a private house
instead of the Louvre palace.

00:21:10.548 --> 00:21:15.881
The museum had a big palace,
which is, as I said before,

00:21:15.881 --> 00:21:19.468
where the small boy,
Louis XIV, lived,

00:21:19.468 --> 00:21:22.568
and then was burned in 1871.
 

00:21:22.568 --> 00:21:27.013
Instead he just went and rented
a private house and fell asleep

00:21:27.013 --> 00:21:28.519
almost immediately.
 

00:21:28.519 --> 00:21:32.104
He loved sleeping on ships;
he thought that the rocking of

00:21:32.104 --> 00:21:35.779
the waves rocked him to sleep,
so he liked doing that.

00:21:35.779 --> 00:21:40.570
Legend has him eating peasant
food--cabbage soup,

00:21:40.570 --> 00:21:44.660
porridge,
meat with pickled cucumbers,

00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:48.088
ham and cheese,
and kvass, which is a drink

00:21:48.088 --> 00:21:52.578
that I've actually tasted from
fermented black bread.

00:21:52.578 --> 00:21:55.049
But he was not indifferent to
foreign food.

00:21:55.049 --> 00:21:56.670
Somebody found an order.
 

00:21:56.670 --> 00:21:59.940
He ordered 200 bottles of
Hermitage wine.

00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:03.226
Hermitage is a really wonderful
and now just horribly overpriced

00:22:03.226 --> 00:22:06.267
wine from the DrÃ´me,
on the left bank of the Rhone

00:22:06.267 --> 00:22:08.269
not very far away from where we
live.

00:22:08.269 --> 00:22:09.509
But it's totally out of price.
 

00:22:09.509 --> 00:22:13.134
But Hermitage was a wine that
was known by connoisseurs in the

00:22:13.134 --> 00:22:16.578
seventeenth and eighteenth
century, and ever since then.

00:22:16.578 --> 00:22:20.848
For all the talk about eating
cabbage and eating with ordinary

00:22:20.848 --> 00:22:24.348
people, even then Hermitage cost
a lot of money.

00:22:24.348 --> 00:22:27.579
He ordered 200 good bottles of
Hermitage wine.

00:22:27.579 --> 00:22:28.778
So, voilÃ .
 

00:22:28.778 --> 00:22:30.769
I wish I had been invited to
these things.

00:22:30.769 --> 00:22:33.618
He was very informal.
 

00:22:33.618 --> 00:22:37.138
There is this legend that he
used to grab these huge chunks

00:22:37.138 --> 00:22:40.779
of meat and started gnawing on
them like he would on a hotdog

00:22:40.779 --> 00:22:43.509
or something like that at a
Yankee game,

00:22:43.509 --> 00:22:46.952
except that other people were
already dressed up and the meat

00:22:46.952 --> 00:22:50.336
and the gravy was flying over
them as he just sort of walked

00:22:50.336 --> 00:22:52.230
around gnawing on this stuff.
 

00:22:52.230 --> 00:22:54.859
Sofia Charlotte of
Brandenburg--I don't know who

00:22:54.859 --> 00:22:57.788
the hell that is,
but it's got to be some royal

00:22:57.788 --> 00:23:01.594
hanger-on--wrote that "It
is evident that he has not been

00:23:01.594 --> 00:23:03.838
taught how to eat
properly."

00:23:03.838 --> 00:23:07.519
But she liked his natural
manner and informality.

00:23:07.519 --> 00:23:12.185
King Frederick of Denmark found
him ill-mannered and

00:23:12.185 --> 00:23:13.650
inappropriate.
 

00:23:13.650 --> 00:23:15.558
He liked to masquerade.
 

00:23:15.558 --> 00:23:20.332
Again, this is his personal
ambivalence about his own role,

00:23:20.332 --> 00:23:24.856
hanging around with ordinary
people, sleeping in peasant

00:23:24.856 --> 00:23:27.818
lodgings and that sort of thing.
 

00:23:27.818 --> 00:23:32.460
He liked to dress up as a
sailor.

00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:35.674
One thing that he always did
when he went on his grand tour

00:23:35.674 --> 00:23:40.337
is he always took fake names,
as if he was signing into a

00:23:40.337 --> 00:23:41.622
hotel as Mr.
 

00:23:41.622 --> 00:23:44.190
and Mrs. John Smith.
 

00:23:44.190 --> 00:23:46.769
He would take the name of a
commoner.

00:23:46.769 --> 00:23:49.702
He didn't sign into a hotel as
Peter the Great or whatever,

00:23:49.702 --> 00:23:52.180
but he would go in with a name
that wasn't his.

00:23:52.180 --> 00:23:56.837
Again, this is just his
personal ambivalence about who

00:23:56.837 --> 00:24:01.759
he was, and his uncertainty
about the role that he had in

00:24:01.759 --> 00:24:03.430
his own family.
 

00:24:03.430 --> 00:24:08.920
So, this was a play-acting that
was part of his life.

00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:13.114
These ornate masquerades and
charades that are part of his

00:24:13.114 --> 00:24:16.720
complexity reveal something
about his identity.

00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:18.288
Then when you see these
portraits of him,

00:24:18.288 --> 00:24:19.308
he looks very czar-like.
 

00:24:19.308 --> 00:24:23.654
He looks like one of these
royal people that were painted

00:24:23.654 --> 00:24:24.818
all the time.
 

00:24:24.818 --> 00:24:29.509
In 1697 he goes west with the
name of Peter Michaeloff.

00:24:29.509 --> 00:24:32.951
Even in his own account books,
which he kept very carefully

00:24:32.951 --> 00:24:34.848
about how much money he spent.
 

00:24:34.848 --> 00:24:37.250
He wasn't radin,
he wasn't a cheapskate.

00:24:37.250 --> 00:24:43.519
But he paid attention to royal
expenses, personal expenses.

00:24:43.519 --> 00:24:48.595
He refers to himself with a
variety of names and titles,

00:24:48.595 --> 00:24:51.270
as captain this,
colonel that,

00:24:51.270 --> 00:24:52.838
general that.
 

00:24:52.838 --> 00:24:55.130
He's not trying to hide his
identity to the future.

00:24:55.130 --> 00:24:56.920
It was very obvious who he was.
 

00:24:56.920 --> 00:25:00.630
His handwriting is recognized
by experts.

00:25:00.630 --> 00:25:02.868
But role-playing takes on
dimensions of the state.

00:25:02.868 --> 00:25:04.830
I mentioned,
I don't remember in what

00:25:04.830 --> 00:25:07.935
context, the other day that the
most famous example is the

00:25:07.935 --> 00:25:09.078
drunken assembly.
 

00:25:09.078 --> 00:25:12.358
It's sort of a mock parallel
government with his buddies.

00:25:12.358 --> 00:25:15.959
It has personnel who are his
buddies, those in favor,

00:25:15.959 --> 00:25:18.588
lots of eating,
drinking, et cetera.

00:25:18.588 --> 00:25:22.560
It has its statutes,
sort of the mock constitution,

00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:27.009
and its rituals that involve
basically getting wasted.

00:25:27.009 --> 00:25:33.060
Again, this is part of his
split personality about who he

00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:33.710
was.
 

00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:36.705
If Hughes is correct,
this is part of him saying that

00:25:36.705 --> 00:25:39.430
being a czar is more than just
dressing up,

00:25:39.430 --> 00:25:42.980
and playing the role,
and going to fancy dances,

00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:46.882
and hanging around with fancy
people who don't do a damn

00:25:46.882 --> 00:25:47.450
thing.
 

00:25:47.450 --> 00:25:48.710
You have to do the work.
 

00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:50.170
You have to walk the walk.
 

00:25:50.170 --> 00:25:52.288
That he did.
 

00:25:52.288 --> 00:25:55.455
You had to manifest strength,
and firmness,

00:25:55.455 --> 00:25:58.623
and bravery,
and worthy deeds that would be

00:25:58.623 --> 00:26:02.619
recognized as being real deeds
by contemporaries.

00:26:02.619 --> 00:26:05.450
He constantly warns his son,
who was kind of an n'er do

00:26:05.450 --> 00:26:06.782
well,
that, "You better work

00:26:06.782 --> 00:26:08.482
hard," or,
"You better work a little

00:26:08.482 --> 00:26:10.380
harder and pay more attention to
what you're doing.

00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:13.208
You'd better care about
military things more than you

00:26:13.208 --> 00:26:13.480
do.
 

00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:15.680
This is what I'm telling you
you'd better do.

00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:18.048
You'd better listen to what I'm
doing."

00:26:18.048 --> 00:26:22.045
But sometimes he would drink a
lot and eat a lot because he

00:26:22.045 --> 00:26:23.630
just needed to relax.
 

00:26:23.630 --> 00:26:25.088
Being a czar was a busy job.
 

00:26:25.088 --> 00:26:27.019
He got up at 4:00 in the
morning.

00:26:27.019 --> 00:26:29.318
He was at his office before
anybody else was.

00:26:29.318 --> 00:26:31.363
People began,
like in any business,

00:26:31.363 --> 00:26:34.910
to be attentive to whether or
not they were early enough.

00:26:34.910 --> 00:26:38.674
"Does he see me that I am
still here when it's getting

00:26:38.674 --> 00:26:39.519
dark?"
 

00:26:39.519 --> 00:26:43.730
Of course, it gets dark in the
winter in St.

00:26:43.730 --> 00:26:46.078
Petersburg about noon.
 

00:26:46.078 --> 00:26:47.980
But anyway, he loved practical
things.

00:26:47.980 --> 00:26:50.900
He loved firefighting,
for example.

00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:54.670
He had a passion for fireworks,
explosives, cannon fire.

00:26:54.670 --> 00:26:57.118
He played the drums.
 

00:26:57.118 --> 00:26:59.890
He loved dancing and he loved
religious singing.

00:26:59.890 --> 00:27:05.250
He loved the choir music of
Russian Orthodox services.

00:27:05.250 --> 00:27:08.710
He loved to play chess and he
loved to play billiards.

00:27:08.710 --> 00:27:11.066
And, as I already said,
he loved mathematical

00:27:11.066 --> 00:27:12.618
instruments and telescopes.
 

00:27:12.618 --> 00:27:14.910
He carried a telescope with him
wherever he went.

00:27:14.910 --> 00:27:18.019
He knew how to use it and he
knew what he was looking for.

00:27:18.019 --> 00:27:19.308
He loved globes.
 

00:27:19.308 --> 00:27:21.140
He loved to see where things
were.

00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:24.241
He liked to see that they
mapped parts of Siberia that

00:27:24.241 --> 00:27:26.348
people didn't know what was
there.

00:27:26.348 --> 00:27:29.019
It was rather like parts of
Africa before the 1880s.

00:27:29.019 --> 00:27:32.676
You see these big blanks,
because nobody had ever been

00:27:32.676 --> 00:27:33.230
there.
 

00:27:33.230 --> 00:27:35.329
He was interested in that.
 

00:27:35.329 --> 00:27:37.500
He was self-taught.
 

00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:41.028
You didn't have to go to some
fancy school if you were a czar,

00:27:41.028 --> 00:27:42.588
to be a czar in training.
 

00:27:42.588 --> 00:27:45.480
You had tutors,
as all these folks did.

00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:49.410
He made spelling mistakes,
which you can see.

00:27:49.410 --> 00:27:51.386
I don't read Russian,
but he made spelling mistakes

00:27:51.386 --> 00:27:52.019
when he wrote.
 

00:27:52.019 --> 00:27:53.660
His handwriting was awful.
 

00:27:53.660 --> 00:27:57.634
Bad handwriting is the nemesis
of historians,

00:27:57.634 --> 00:27:58.808
to be sure.
 

00:27:58.808 --> 00:28:01.948
But he built a private library,
and it wasn't just full of

00:28:01.948 --> 00:28:02.940
religious books.
 

00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:06.241
It was practical books about
fortifications,

00:28:06.241 --> 00:28:10.390
hydraulics, artillery,
navigation, and shipbuilding.

00:28:10.390 --> 00:28:12.980
But he also sang religious
music.

00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:16.805
He had many religious books,
the kind of standard liturgical

00:28:16.805 --> 00:28:20.940
texts that were the stuff of
religious enthusiasm,

00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:28.038
and more modern theological
works in the Russian Orthodox

00:28:28.038 --> 00:28:29.558
tradition.
 

00:28:29.558 --> 00:28:33.587
Another point about this sort
of ambivalence about being czar

00:28:33.587 --> 00:28:37.414
is that he often made a point of
choosing his most trusted

00:28:37.414 --> 00:28:40.972
advisors from the ranks of
commoners and gave them the

00:28:40.972 --> 00:28:44.933
right to become titled after a
certain amount of time in the

00:28:44.933 --> 00:28:46.680
royal bureaucracy.
 

00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:51.146
But sometimes he had a tendency
to pick people whom he liked a

00:28:51.146 --> 00:28:54.954
lot but were totally
unqualified, military commanders

00:28:54.954 --> 00:28:56.858
who weren't very good.
 

00:28:56.858 --> 00:29:03.442
But what he does is he cuts off
Russian absolutism from this

00:29:03.442 --> 00:29:10.134
totally religious culture that
represented 100 percent of the

00:29:10.134 --> 00:29:15.627
official culture,
in a real sense the

00:29:15.627 --> 00:29:21.460
culture of pre-Petrian,
that is pre-Peter, Russia.

00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:24.099
Russian culture was entirely
religious.

00:29:24.099 --> 00:29:27.036
If you went to Poland,
where I go often,

00:29:27.036 --> 00:29:31.190
as I've said before,
if you went to Krakow,

00:29:31.190 --> 00:29:35.269
where Copernicus worked--I've
been in Copernicus' workroom,

00:29:35.269 --> 00:29:38.288
and it's absolutely
fantastic--in Krakow you had a

00:29:38.288 --> 00:29:39.460
major university.
 

00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:42.479
It was an important center of
learning, a diffusion of

00:29:42.479 --> 00:29:45.555
scientific ideas in the
scientific revolution and later

00:29:45.555 --> 00:29:47.150
of Enlightenment ideals.
 

00:29:47.150 --> 00:29:50.625
In Vilnius, which is the
capital of Lithuania,

00:29:50.625 --> 00:29:53.019
you had a university as well.
 

00:29:53.019 --> 00:29:55.230
But there wasn't a university
in Russia.

00:29:55.230 --> 00:29:58.773
There was no equivalent of the
Royal Society that you're

00:29:58.773 --> 00:30:02.833
reading about in London that was
very important in the diffusion

00:30:02.833 --> 00:30:04.960
of the scientific revolution.
 

00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:09.190
There's nothing like the
AcadÃ©mie des sciences,

00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:13.421
the Academy of Sciences in
Paris, which was founded in

00:30:13.421 --> 00:30:14.140
1666.
 

00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:17.819
There's no legal tradition,
so there's no law school.

00:30:17.819 --> 00:30:19.880
There's no medical school.
 

00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:21.890
There's no secular culture.
 

00:30:21.890 --> 00:30:26.348
Ninety-percent of all the books
that were published before Peter

00:30:26.348 --> 00:30:29.038
were devotional texts in the
church.

00:30:29.038 --> 00:30:32.743
There was no word literally in
Russian for the state,

00:30:32.743 --> 00:30:35.950
or for the monarchy,
or for the government.

00:30:35.950 --> 00:30:38.160
They did not exist.
 

00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:43.175
The state was an abstraction,
but in the person of the czar

00:30:43.175 --> 00:30:44.818
it was a reality.
 

00:30:44.818 --> 00:30:48.111
Now, the Boyars,
in the 1660s and the 1670s,

00:30:48.111 --> 00:30:51.710
some of them began to learn
Latin and Polish.

00:30:51.710 --> 00:30:55.738
Diplomacy is still in Latin
until the end of the seventeenth

00:30:55.738 --> 00:30:57.718
century and then,
as you know,

00:30:57.718 --> 00:30:59.220
it becomes French.
 

00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:01.778
So, what about his
accomplishments,

00:31:01.778 --> 00:31:05.917
besides the ones I've already
mentioned, to which I will

00:31:05.917 --> 00:31:07.950
return in a little bit.
 

00:31:07.950 --> 00:31:12.623
Muscovy had already conquered
the Volga basin in the sixteenth

00:31:12.623 --> 00:31:16.759
century, where the nomadic
Tatars were, T-A-T-A-R-S.

00:31:16.759 --> 00:31:19.405
This is important,
because it's the black earth

00:31:19.405 --> 00:31:21.420
region of rich agriculture
there.

00:31:21.420 --> 00:31:25.720
What happens in Russia is what
happens in Prussia,

00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:28.019
as well, and in other parts of
Eastern Europe,

00:31:28.019 --> 00:31:30.289
particularly in the Hapsburg
domains--you have,

00:31:30.289 --> 00:31:34.313
to make a very bad pun,
a resurfacing of the region by

00:31:34.313 --> 00:31:37.900
people forced into serf
contracts.

00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:39.088
Not contracts.
 

00:31:39.088 --> 00:31:44.318
They become legally part of the
land, literally.

00:31:44.318 --> 00:31:52.048
This follows the arrival of the
expansion of serfdom.

00:31:52.048 --> 00:31:56.460
Serfdom expands along with the
Russian empire.

00:31:56.460 --> 00:32:01.092
They already held Siberia and
they reached the Pacific Ocean

00:32:01.092 --> 00:32:02.269
in the 1640s.
 

00:32:02.269 --> 00:32:06.464
So, I already said what the
number of square miles that were

00:32:06.464 --> 00:32:10.803
increased, but it increases from
six to sixteen million of the

00:32:10.803 --> 00:32:11.868
population.
 

00:32:11.868 --> 00:32:15.011
They expand north to Archangel,
so this gives them a port,

00:32:15.011 --> 00:32:16.058
but a frozen one.
 

00:32:16.058 --> 00:32:19.291
And, as I already said,
south and southeast to the

00:32:19.291 --> 00:32:20.809
expense of the Turks.
 

00:32:20.809 --> 00:32:23.619
But Peter wanted a navy.
 

00:32:23.619 --> 00:32:26.650
It's sort of circular reasoning.
 

00:32:26.650 --> 00:32:28.818
If you want to have a navy,
you have to have a port.

00:32:28.818 --> 00:32:30.924
And if you're going to have a
port, then you have to have a

00:32:30.924 --> 00:32:31.180
navy.
 

00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:33.259
Why not?
 

00:32:33.259 --> 00:32:39.226
He first built a navy on rivers
using Dutch shipmasters from

00:32:39.226 --> 00:32:40.440
Amsterdam.
 

00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:43.513
He once said that if he wasn't
the czar of all the Russians,

00:32:43.513 --> 00:32:46.380
what he would want to be would
be an English admiral.

00:32:46.380 --> 00:32:50.368
He learned Dutch--and Dutch is
a very difficult language--in

00:32:50.368 --> 00:32:51.931
1696,
while the Turkish war went on,

00:32:51.931 --> 00:32:54.702
or one of them,
he went off to Western Europe

00:32:54.702 --> 00:32:57.200
incognito as an embassy soldier.
 

00:32:57.200 --> 00:32:59.734
Again, it was part of his
gamesmanship,

00:32:59.734 --> 00:33:01.068
his pretend games.
 

00:33:01.068 --> 00:33:05.470
There he learned carpentry in a
very serious way.

00:33:05.470 --> 00:33:09.227
He went to the Leiden Medical
School, because he wanted to see

00:33:09.227 --> 00:33:10.890
how you dissected bodies.
 

00:33:10.890 --> 00:33:13.538
He went there, too.
 

00:33:13.538 --> 00:33:17.435
Then he went to London,
along the Thames,

00:33:17.435 --> 00:33:22.990
the major port of the world
then, along with Amsterdam.

00:33:22.990 --> 00:33:27.288
He learned shipbuilding there
as well.

00:33:27.288 --> 00:33:29.700
Because the building of ships
was,

00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:32.420
to him, the application of
rationality,

00:33:32.420 --> 00:33:35.230
of reason, thinking,
and experimentation,

00:33:35.230 --> 00:33:38.519
this got him interested in the
scientific revolution.

00:33:38.519 --> 00:33:40.880
There's nothing too surprising
about that.

00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:43.390
The essence of the scientific
revolution.

00:33:43.390 --> 00:33:46.085
He may have even attended a
Quaker meeting,

00:33:46.085 --> 00:33:48.140
but we're not sure about that.
 

00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:51.663
The problem was if you have a
basically landlocked power and

00:33:51.663 --> 00:33:55.009
want to get to the sea,
then you'd better have a navy.

00:33:55.009 --> 00:33:59.450
He'd learned to sail when he
was young, but on the river.

00:33:59.450 --> 00:34:02.939
This also, by the way,
gets him interested in Baroque

00:34:02.939 --> 00:34:06.762
and these kinds of Baroque
masquerades that he had back in

00:34:06.762 --> 00:34:08.239
Moscow and then in St.
 

00:34:08.239 --> 00:34:09.849
Petersburg as well.
 

00:34:09.849 --> 00:34:14.710
So, in all of this,
what he does is he makes,

00:34:14.710 --> 00:34:17.530
to use an expression that I've
already used before in the

00:34:17.530 --> 00:34:20.349
context of absolutism,
he makes the Boyars,

00:34:20.349 --> 00:34:22.559
while he's building his navy
and expanding Russia,

00:34:22.559 --> 00:34:27.130
he makes the Boyar junior
partners in absolutism.

00:34:27.130 --> 00:34:28.679
That phrase again.
 

00:34:28.679 --> 00:34:33.550
Now, there are only about
200-300 Boyar families.

00:34:33.550 --> 00:34:36.561
They own, by the way,
40,000 serfs,

00:34:36.561 --> 00:34:41.699
own 40,000 serfs,
just these 200 to 300 families.

00:34:41.699 --> 00:34:46.695
They build huge houses in the
seventeenth century in Moscow

00:34:46.695 --> 00:34:50.315
with very old-fashioned
traditional Russian

00:34:50.315 --> 00:34:51.780
architecture.
 

00:34:51.780 --> 00:34:55.623
The Russian empire was rather
like Charlemagne's empire in 800

00:34:55.623 --> 00:34:59.719
in the coronation at Aachen or
Aix-la-Chapelle and all of that.

00:34:59.719 --> 00:35:03.972
You have this bureaucracy
that's--it's not really a

00:35:03.972 --> 00:35:06.356
bureaucracy,
but you've got these royal

00:35:06.356 --> 00:35:08.059
officials representing the royal
will,

00:35:08.059 --> 00:35:11.952
but the actual impact in this
vast expanse of the Russian

00:35:11.952 --> 00:35:13.760
empire isn't that great.
 

00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:17.094
There's nobody telling people
what to do on a day-to-day or

00:35:17.094 --> 00:35:18.820
even a month-to-month basis.
 

00:35:18.820 --> 00:35:24.637
Yet there's an enhanced sense
of obligation to the czar of all

00:35:24.637 --> 00:35:26.639
the Russian people.
 

00:35:26.639 --> 00:35:31.219
There's an advanced sense of
state and of organization.

00:35:31.219 --> 00:35:34.010
That also is one of the things
to put in neon.

00:35:34.010 --> 00:35:37.000
He creates committees of
advisors that,

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:40.076
in many ways,
are not that different than the

00:35:40.076 --> 00:35:43.992
kinds of ministries that would
evolve in western absolute

00:35:43.992 --> 00:35:49.384
rulers--absolute states,
and in non-absolute states as

00:35:49.384 --> 00:35:50.079
well.
 

00:35:50.079 --> 00:35:55.960
By 1708 and 1709 he has created
a more European-style

00:35:55.960 --> 00:36:00.260
administration for this vast
empire.

00:36:00.260 --> 00:36:01.780
He wants to build a capital
city.

00:36:01.780 --> 00:36:03.108
That's where St.
 

00:36:03.108 --> 00:36:05.018
Petersburg comes from.
 

00:36:05.018 --> 00:36:10.545
It had been Swedish territory,
and his victories give him this

00:36:10.545 --> 00:36:11.179
land.
 

00:36:11.179 --> 00:36:16.978
I once went to visit the summer
palace that he created and that

00:36:16.978 --> 00:36:20.159
Nicholas II loved so much there.
 

00:36:20.159 --> 00:36:22.820
He constructs this new capital.
 

00:36:22.820 --> 00:36:24.416
What's important about the
construction of St.

00:36:24.416 --> 00:36:26.333
Petersburg--I don't know how
many of you have ever been

00:36:26.333 --> 00:36:28.224
there;
I haven't been there for a

00:36:28.224 --> 00:36:31.710
very, very long time--this city
is not like Moscow at all.

00:36:31.710 --> 00:36:34.527
When you look at Moscow you see
these old traditional,

00:36:34.527 --> 00:36:37.559
the skyline is dominated by
churches, the influence of the

00:36:37.559 --> 00:36:39.050
Russian Orthodox Church.
 

00:36:39.050 --> 00:36:39.217
St.
 

00:36:39.217 --> 00:36:41.230
Petersburg is completely
different.

00:36:41.230 --> 00:36:49.030
It is an example of classic
great power, absolute urban

00:36:49.030 --> 00:36:50.619
planning.
 

00:36:50.619 --> 00:36:54.579
It has a long boulevard,
the Nevski Prospect,

00:36:54.579 --> 00:36:56.829
very important in 1917.
 

00:36:56.829 --> 00:36:58.840
The most dominant buildings are
not churches;

00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:00.829
they are state buildings.
 

00:37:00.829 --> 00:37:02.480
They are state structures.
 

00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:04.090
It's a different place.
 

00:37:04.090 --> 00:37:06.000
It reminds you of Madrid.
 

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.429
It reminds you of Berlin.
 

00:37:08.429 --> 00:37:12.563
It reminds you of Versailles
and it reminds you of the

00:37:12.563 --> 00:37:16.309
post-Haussman Paris,
that is, post 1850s and 1860

00:37:16.309 --> 00:37:17.090
Paris.
 

00:37:17.090 --> 00:37:22.342
It is an example of what I call
the imperialism of the straight

00:37:22.342 --> 00:37:24.541
line,
where you have large boulevards

00:37:24.541 --> 00:37:26.309
that you can march armies down
to,

00:37:26.309 --> 00:37:28.550
reviewing stands and all of
that,

00:37:28.550 --> 00:37:30.610
totally different than Moscow.
 

00:37:30.610 --> 00:37:35.036
The religious leaders did not
like Peter, because Peter is

00:37:35.036 --> 00:37:38.920
bringing in to Russian culture
foreign elements.

00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:43.248
They were already suspicious of
the implementation or the

00:37:43.248 --> 00:37:46.420
annexation of Baroque religious
forms,

00:37:46.420 --> 00:37:50.608
architectural forms and
liturgical influences from

00:37:50.608 --> 00:37:56.478
Austria and from Central Europe,
and now they've got a guy who's

00:37:56.478 --> 00:38:01.583
telling the Boyars' women to
dress like western European

00:38:01.583 --> 00:38:02.420
women.
 

00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:06.652
At a time when beards meant a
great deal religiously,

00:38:06.652 --> 00:38:10.639
he's telling the men to shave
off their beards.

00:38:10.639 --> 00:38:16.269
He's telling the men to wield
forks and knives as well as

00:38:16.269 --> 00:38:20.393
weapons, and to adopt
non-Russian customs,

00:38:20.393 --> 00:38:23.409
to bring them into Russia.
 

00:38:23.409 --> 00:38:26.079
There's tremendous tension with
the church.

00:38:26.079 --> 00:38:31.625
But he remains--he is a true
believer, but he is bringing

00:38:31.625 --> 00:38:36.972
into Russian religious culture
changes that were deeply

00:38:36.972 --> 00:38:38.260
resented.
 

00:38:38.260 --> 00:38:41.621
Some aristocrats began to put
on western style wigs,

00:38:41.621 --> 00:38:45.050
such as you could find at the
court of Versailles.

00:38:45.050 --> 00:38:48.851
Women had to wear high heels
and they were tottering along

00:38:48.851 --> 00:38:52.989
and falling on the cobblestones
wearing high heels and European

00:38:52.989 --> 00:38:54.190
style dresses.
 

00:38:54.190 --> 00:38:58.539
He promulgates decrees as czar
about daily life.

00:38:58.539 --> 00:39:01.550
This is a big transformation.
 

00:39:01.550 --> 00:39:04.005
As to his son,
his son was more under the

00:39:04.005 --> 00:39:07.320
influence of these traditional
religious influences.

00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:11.159
He is plotting against his own
father.

00:39:11.159 --> 00:39:16.268
Peter, on one of his trips,
has to return back to Russia.

00:39:16.268 --> 00:39:21.503
In 1716 and 1718 Alexis had
taken his mother's side in the

00:39:21.503 --> 00:39:26.920
divorce and did not like the
Latvian peasant second wife.

00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:29.170
He also didn't like military
service.

00:39:29.170 --> 00:39:30.309
He was lazy.
 

00:39:30.309 --> 00:39:32.242
His father said,
"I see you are spending

00:39:32.242 --> 00:39:34.626
more of your time in idleness
than in taking care of business

00:39:34.626 --> 00:39:35.820
at this crucial time."
 

00:39:35.820 --> 00:39:38.710
But Alexis doesn't get the
point.

00:39:38.710 --> 00:39:44.610
He begins to plot in various
ways with dissident Boyars.

00:39:44.610 --> 00:39:47.186
He goes off and gets the
support of the emperor of

00:39:47.186 --> 00:39:49.659
Austria to wage a war against
his own father.

00:39:49.659 --> 00:39:51.070
Terrible idea.
 

00:39:51.070 --> 00:39:54.929
When he returns,
his father orders him tortured.

00:39:54.929 --> 00:39:58.672
Under torture,
Alexis--who probably dies of

00:39:58.672 --> 00:40:03.128
cold, not of torture,
in a very frozen cell-- named

00:40:03.128 --> 00:40:05.090
Boyar accomplices.
 

00:40:05.090 --> 00:40:07.900
These people are toast,
obviously.

00:40:07.900 --> 00:40:12.463
The son probably died of TB,
but it related to all this

00:40:12.463 --> 00:40:15.760
other business in his weakened
state.

00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:17.260
That was the end of the son.
 

00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:22.411
But what lasted longer than
Alexis was the Europeanization

00:40:22.411 --> 00:40:24.309
of Russian culture.
 

00:40:24.309 --> 00:40:29.768
Peter the Great has books
translated from the west,

00:40:29.768 --> 00:40:33.809
including John Locke,
into Russian.

00:40:33.809 --> 00:40:35.492
This, itself,
was a remarkable

00:40:35.492 --> 00:40:36.480
accomplishment.
 

00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:39.353
After all, the Russian Orthodox
churchmen had not been

00:40:39.353 --> 00:40:42.500
interested in the Renaissance at
all, not interested in the

00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:45.179
scientific revolution at all;
and, by 1710,

00:40:45.179 --> 00:40:49.427
Russian students are being sent
abroad to foreign universities,

00:40:49.427 --> 00:40:52.648
particularly in Italy,
but also in France and in

00:40:52.648 --> 00:40:53.539
England.
 

00:40:53.539 --> 00:40:55.949
They're studying practical
things like marble work,

00:40:55.949 --> 00:40:57.443
and metal work,
and copper work,

00:40:57.443 --> 00:40:58.889
and not just shipbuilding.
 

00:40:58.889 --> 00:41:03.400
They're also studying the life
of the mind.

00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:06.489
In a way, it's possible to
argue,

00:41:06.489 --> 00:41:09.179
which is what I'm arguing and
I'm not the first to do it,

00:41:09.179 --> 00:41:10.380
but Peter the Great was,
in many ways,

00:41:10.380 --> 00:41:16.469
himself a child of European
rationalism,

00:41:16.469 --> 00:41:22.110
of a scientific culture of
rationality and of,

00:41:22.110 --> 00:41:26.349
at least in the earlier stages,
the Enlightenment.

00:41:26.349 --> 00:41:29.523
He was not against the church,
but he thought that people were

00:41:29.523 --> 00:41:33.396
wasting time being monks,
and other people were all over

00:41:33.396 --> 00:41:37.440
the place in their Russian
Orthodox equivalent.

00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:40.440
He believed whatever one wag
once set of monks,

00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:42.788
"I sleep,
I eat, I digest,"

00:41:42.788 --> 00:41:44.809
and they prayed,
of course.

00:41:44.809 --> 00:41:47.978
To him this was not useless,
because it didn't serve the

00:41:47.978 --> 00:41:48.440
state.
 

00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:53.139
It didn't serve the dynastic
interests of the dynasty,

00:41:53.139 --> 00:41:57.219
which he identified with the
Russian people.

00:41:57.219 --> 00:42:01.161
He did not ever imagine the
abandonment of the table of

00:42:01.161 --> 00:42:03.985
ranks,
which set everybody in a

00:42:03.985 --> 00:42:06.309
hierarchy,
not for a minute--we're talking

00:42:06.309 --> 00:42:08.590
about the end of the end of the
seventeenth and eighteenth

00:42:08.590 --> 00:42:09.030
century.
 

00:42:09.030 --> 00:42:12.021
But he believed that it was
important to take the tools of

00:42:12.021 --> 00:42:14.101
science,
to take the tools of rational

00:42:14.101 --> 00:42:16.690
thought and apply them to the
good of the state,

00:42:16.690 --> 00:42:20.478
even if you saw that good of
the state as in ships that could

00:42:20.478 --> 00:42:23.889
lob cannonballs even further
against hostile ships,

00:42:23.889 --> 00:42:25.679
and that kind of thing.
 

00:42:25.679 --> 00:42:29.585
But he founds the first Russian
museum, the first school of

00:42:29.585 --> 00:42:32.820
navigation, the first school of
this and that.

00:42:32.820 --> 00:42:36.380
There are 100 times more books,
pamphlets, prints,

00:42:36.380 --> 00:42:40.404
and maps produced in Russia
under the time of Peter the

00:42:40.404 --> 00:42:44.800
Great than there had been in the
whole previous century.

00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:46.940
Peter, as Lindsey Hughes has
argued,

00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:51.340
was highly suspicious of any
alternative to state service,

00:42:51.340 --> 00:42:53.139
especially the monastic way of
life,

00:42:53.139 --> 00:42:55.179
which I've already said.
 

00:42:55.179 --> 00:42:58.844
But he thought that it should
be channeled through state

00:42:58.844 --> 00:43:01.909
obligations, be there taxes or
labor duties.

00:43:01.909 --> 00:43:04.721
At the same time,
he's equally suspicious of the

00:43:04.721 --> 00:43:05.320
godless.
 

00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:10.309
So, he remained very Russian,
but it was the importation of

00:43:10.309 --> 00:43:15.989
more western ways of looking at
things that were very important.

00:43:15.989 --> 00:43:18.059
He wrote once that,
"The chief thing is to

00:43:18.059 --> 00:43:20.677
know your duties and our edicts
by heart and not put off things

00:43:20.677 --> 00:43:22.449
until tomorrow,"
like his son did.

00:43:22.449 --> 00:43:27.010
"For how can a state
government exist if edicts are

00:43:27.010 --> 00:43:28.918
not put into use?"
 

00:43:28.918 --> 00:43:30.909
et cetera, et cetera.
 

00:43:30.909 --> 00:43:34.619
Their lives should be better.
 

00:43:34.619 --> 00:43:39.456
The concept of the state was
fundamentally new to Russia,

00:43:39.456 --> 00:43:42.996
but gradually came into
existence, and his

00:43:42.996 --> 00:43:46.969
accomplishments had a lot to do
with that.

00:43:46.969 --> 00:43:49.429
He wrote his son in 1704,
he said, "I may die

00:43:49.429 --> 00:43:52.543
tomorrow, but be sure that you
have little pleasure if you fail

00:43:52.543 --> 00:43:53.800
to follow my example.
 

00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:56.327
You must love everything that
contributes to the glory and

00:43:56.327 --> 00:43:57.480
honor of the fatherland.
 

00:43:57.480 --> 00:43:59.817
You must love loyal advisors
and servants,

00:43:59.817 --> 00:44:02.324
whether they be foreigners or
our own people,

00:44:02.324 --> 00:44:05.460
and spare no effort to serve
the common good."

00:44:05.460 --> 00:44:08.710
The common good comes right out
of enlightened thought.

00:44:08.710 --> 00:44:11.860
It comes out of Locke and those
folks.

00:44:11.860 --> 00:44:16.434
"If my advice is lost in
the wind and you do not do as I

00:44:16.434 --> 00:44:20.018
wish, I do not recognize you as
my son."

00:44:20.018 --> 00:44:24.320
That, in the end,
is what came in the long run.

00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:26.911
He remained a fanatically
Russian patriot,

00:44:26.911 --> 00:44:28.619
the father of his people.
 

00:44:28.619 --> 00:44:32.237
His admiration for foreign
things and approaches was

00:44:32.237 --> 00:44:35.998
tempered by, as Hughes argues,
his devotion to Russia,

00:44:35.998 --> 00:44:37.489
which he oversaw.
 

00:44:37.489 --> 00:44:41.666
The common good became a real
concept and one that,

00:44:41.666 --> 00:44:45.260
unfortunately,
some of his successors didn't

00:44:45.260 --> 00:44:47.599
take terribly seriously.
 

00:44:47.599 --> 00:44:49.496
In conclusion,
he defiantly,

00:44:49.496 --> 00:44:52.235
deliberately,
and effectively broke with

00:44:52.235 --> 00:44:53.219
tradition.
 

00:44:53.219 --> 00:44:57.119
In doing so he made himself
sort of an outsider to

00:44:57.119 --> 00:45:01.260
traditional Russian ways of
looking at this thing.

00:45:01.260 --> 00:45:03.960
This ambivalence that was part
of his personal life,

00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:06.980
the way he lived,
would be a constant theme in

00:45:06.980 --> 00:45:10.760
subsequent Russian and still,
in many ways, is today.

00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:13.010
Between Slavophiles and
westernizers,

00:45:13.010 --> 00:45:17.342
those are the people that look
inside Russia to finding what

00:45:17.342 --> 00:45:21.601
they think to be eternal truth
and those people who want to

00:45:21.601 --> 00:45:24.980
temper such looks with a look to
the west.

00:45:24.980 --> 00:45:28.681
That, in neon,
is what Peter the Great did

00:45:28.681 --> 00:45:33.559
above all and for which he shall
most be remembered.

00:45:33.559 --> 00:45:36.894
Next time to the Enlightenment,
and some people whom you might

00:45:36.894 --> 00:45:40.340
not think of at first glance
would seem terribly enlightened.

00:45:40.340 --> 00:45:41.139
See you on Wednesday.

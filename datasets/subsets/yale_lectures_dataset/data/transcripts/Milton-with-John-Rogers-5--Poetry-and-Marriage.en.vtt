00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:04.956
Professor John Rogers:
Milton is typically cited

00:00:04.956 --> 00:00:08.129
by literary historians as one of
the first major English poets to

00:00:08.129 --> 00:00:10.510
praise in verse the institution
of marriage.

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:13.071
In this respect,
he seems to have followed

00:00:13.071 --> 00:00:16.508
Spenser -- Edmund Spenser,
whose Faerie Queene is

00:00:16.508 --> 00:00:20.070
in large part a tribute to the
sacrament of marriage,

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.021
although interestingly
The Faerie Queene,

00:00:23.021 --> 00:00:26.767
the great Spenserian poem,
never actually manages to

00:00:26.767 --> 00:00:30.110
feature a marriage between two
human beings.

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:33.531
The only marriage that actually
appears there is a marriage

00:00:33.531 --> 00:00:35.611
between two rivers.
Nonetheless,

00:00:35.611 --> 00:00:39.468
The Faerie Queene can be
said, however strangely,

00:00:39.468 --> 00:00:43.466
to be the first great poetic
celebration in English of the

00:00:43.466 --> 00:00:46.920
institution of marriage.
This was important to Milton,

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.859
and one of the big set-piece
speeches in Paradise Lost

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:52.798
-- and you may remember it if
you've read that poem -- is the

00:00:52.798 --> 00:00:55.770
hymn that begins "Hail,
wedded Love."

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.610
Milton is adamant throughout
the epic in his insistent

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.826
imagining Adam and Eve quite
specifically as a married couple

00:01:01.826 --> 00:01:04.988
and a married couple -- and this
is important to Milton -- a

00:01:04.988 --> 00:01:07.400
married couple with an active
sex life.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.011
They're a couple whose marital
blessing had been granted by

00:01:11.011 --> 00:01:15.650
none other than God himself.
Now the treatises that Milton

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.523
wrote on the rights of divorce
in the 1640s are also

00:01:20.523 --> 00:01:25.324
extravagantly pro-marriage.
A happy marriage for Milton was

00:01:25.324 --> 00:01:28.819
founded on a couple of
like-minded opinions and values,

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:31.499
their ability to converse with
one another -- and so this is

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:34.269
why the notion of divorce for
reasons of incompatibility is so

00:01:34.269 --> 00:01:37.381
important to Milton,
because compatibility in

00:01:37.381 --> 00:01:40.920
marriage is the very essence of
marriage.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.325
I can only imagine though,
at this point in the semester,

00:01:45.325 --> 00:01:49.809
what will become Milton's
eventual championing of marriage

00:01:49.809 --> 00:01:53.946
is pretty hard to imagine,
in part because we're just

00:01:53.946 --> 00:01:57.773
devoting our second class to a
literary work given almost

00:01:57.773 --> 00:02:00.370
entirely to the virtue of
chastity.

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:04.388
And there's every indication
that -- and I mentioned before,

00:02:04.388 --> 00:02:08.202
of course -- there's every
indication that a lot of these

00:02:08.202 --> 00:02:12.220
early works bespeak something
like a serious interest in the

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.035
ideal of a lifelong state of
chastity.Chastity is not

00:02:16.035 --> 00:02:20.257
only an obsessive topic in the
early poems for Milton or in the

00:02:20.257 --> 00:02:24.140
published treatise that we
looked at last time,

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.635
The Apology for Smectymnuus.
It's also a subject that we

00:02:28.635 --> 00:02:33.387
can find in the reading journal
that Milton kept for the better

00:02:33.387 --> 00:02:37.295
part of his life.
The text into which any early

00:02:37.295 --> 00:02:41.637
modern seventeenth-century
writer would jot his or her

00:02:41.637 --> 00:02:44.537
thoughts into,
his reading notes,

00:02:44.537 --> 00:02:47.720
was always called a commonplace
book.

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.547
Milton, like so many of his
contemporaries,

00:02:50.547 --> 00:02:53.712
kept a commonplace book and,
as you can imagine,

00:02:53.712 --> 00:02:56.539
he kept it for the most part in
Latin.

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:58.783
Actually we have Milton's
commonplace book,

00:02:58.783 --> 00:03:01.133
his reading notes,
and you can find it all in

00:03:01.133 --> 00:03:04.177
English translation in volume
one of The Complete Prose

00:03:04.177 --> 00:03:06.839
Works of John Milton.
It's in the CCL

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:10.691
collection.Now one of the
entries in Milton's commonplace

00:03:10.691 --> 00:03:14.478
book that touches on the subject
of chastity strikes me as a

00:03:14.478 --> 00:03:18.780
particularly charged one for its
terrifying image of violence.

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.979
I've never really known what to
do with this.

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:26.060
I think that the entry could be
seen as in some way helpful for

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.830
our understanding of this poem,
the Mask.

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:32.937
So this is what we know.
Sometime in the year 1639,

00:03:32.937 --> 00:03:37.209
Milton read a history book
entitled The General

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:42.354
Chronicle of England in
which there is a discussion in a

00:03:42.354 --> 00:03:47.760
treatise on medieval England --
a discussion of a brutal Danish

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.730
invasion in the ninth century of
a Catholic convent in the

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:57.480
English city of Coldingham.
Milton jots down the historical

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.234
detail from this account that
seems to have caught his

00:04:00.234 --> 00:04:03.620
attention,
and this is what he notes as

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:08.255
particularly memorable:
The nun Ebba cut off her

00:04:08.255 --> 00:04:12.611
nose and lips and urged the
other sisters [the other nuns in

00:04:12.611 --> 00:04:15.565
the convent]
to do the same thing so that

00:04:15.565 --> 00:04:20.070
frustrated in this way the Danes
would make no attempt against

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.643
their virtue.
It's the violence of this

00:04:23.643 --> 00:04:26.885
horrible act of self-sacrifice,
this tragic act of

00:04:26.885 --> 00:04:30.193
self-sacrifice -- an act of
self-sacrifice intended

00:04:30.193 --> 00:04:34.228
obviously to preserve the state
of virginity -- that grabs our

00:04:34.228 --> 00:04:37.470
attention and presumably grabbed
Milton's.

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:40.721
In order to avoid the violation
of their virginity at the hands

00:04:40.721 --> 00:04:44.732
of the brutal Danish brigands,
Ebba leads a convent full of

00:04:44.732 --> 00:04:49.230
nuns to disfigure themselves,
severing nose and lips.

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:51.674
As you can imagine,
there's no historical evidence

00:04:51.674 --> 00:04:53.519
that anything like this took
place,

00:04:53.519 --> 00:04:58.749
and it actually seems to be
something of an urban legend

00:04:58.749 --> 00:05:03.313
among medieval writers
recounting early Christian

00:05:03.313 --> 00:05:06.793
convents.
This same story about the nuns'

00:05:06.793 --> 00:05:11.135
disseveration of their nose and
their lips seems to have been

00:05:11.135 --> 00:05:15.766
told about just all of the early
Christian nunneries -- a strange

00:05:15.766 --> 00:05:19.601
cultural fantasy manifesting
itself in some way -- but

00:05:19.601 --> 00:05:24.232
nonetheless Milton includes this
in his commonplace entry with no

00:05:24.232 --> 00:05:26.724
commentary,
no observation,

00:05:26.724 --> 00:05:30.344
and no interpretation of
it.I think we could make

00:05:30.344 --> 00:05:34.034
some estimation of its
significance if we juxtapose it

00:05:34.034 --> 00:05:38.490
with Comus since The
Mask attempts to tackle,

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:43.940
in a much more expanded form,
so many of the same issues.

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:47.331
Comus is an elaborate
meditation not simply on

00:05:47.331 --> 00:05:50.069
chastity but also on the threat
of rape.

00:05:50.069 --> 00:05:52.563
And of course,
as I mentioned last time,

00:05:52.563 --> 00:05:56.272
Comus himself suggests nothing
more than wanting to get the

00:05:56.272 --> 00:05:59.149
Lady to drink a sip from the
charmed cup,

00:05:59.149 --> 00:06:03.115
but it's clear from his
language that the subtext at

00:06:03.115 --> 00:06:06.069
least behind his seduction
involves,

00:06:06.069 --> 00:06:10.291
in some way at least,
an intimation of the Lady's

00:06:10.291 --> 00:06:14.245
sexual submission.
The potential danger besetting

00:06:14.245 --> 00:06:18.781
the Lady is certainly a subject
of some concern for her dutiful

00:06:18.781 --> 00:06:21.491
brothers.
You remember they're wandering

00:06:21.491 --> 00:06:24.360
around the forest without her
picking berries.

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.511
The younger brother,
the second brother,

00:06:26.511 --> 00:06:29.765
is most concerned about his
sister's safety -- so I want you

00:06:29.765 --> 00:06:34.065
to look at this passage.
This is line 398 of Comus,

00:06:34.065 --> 00:06:37.769
page ninety-nine in the
Hughes.

00:06:37.769 --> 00:06:41.251
So the second brother says
that the Lady is an open target

00:06:41.251 --> 00:06:44.705
out there for an assault:
You may as well spread

00:06:44.705 --> 00:06:48.531
out the unsunn'd heaps
Of Miser's treasure by an

00:06:48.531 --> 00:06:51.472
outlaw's den,
And tell me it is safe,

00:06:51.472 --> 00:06:54.798
as bid me hope
Danger will wink on Opportunity

00:06:54.798 --> 00:06:57.990
[will not allow itself to see
opportunity],

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:00.449
And let a single helpless
maiden pass

00:07:00.449 --> 00:07:05.759
Uninjured in this wild
surrounding waste.

00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:10.228
So notice first here that the
younger brother compares his

00:07:10.228 --> 00:07:13.600
sister's virginity to a miser's
treasure.

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:17.960
In this particularly odd image
you have something like a veiled

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:22.039
accusation -- and it's not
unlike Comus' accusation -- that

00:07:22.039 --> 00:07:25.485
the Lady is hoarding her
God-given treasure of her

00:07:25.485 --> 00:07:28.865
chastity,
with all of the resonances of

00:07:28.865 --> 00:07:33.196
the parable of the talents
that we see in Comus'

00:07:33.196 --> 00:07:36.130
similar language.
But you also notice the sense

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:38.424
of limitation and the
vulnerability associated with

00:07:38.424 --> 00:07:40.259
the physical state of virginity
here.

00:07:40.259 --> 00:07:42.729
As wonderful as the Lady's
chastity might be,

00:07:42.729 --> 00:07:45.816
it's certainly not going to
protect her from the dangers

00:07:45.816 --> 00:07:48.230
lurking in this wild surrounding
waste.

00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:51.626
If anything,
her chastity will only attract

00:07:51.626 --> 00:07:55.670
such injuries.As we saw in
the last lecture,

00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:58.471
the elder brother holds an
entirely different theory of

00:07:58.471 --> 00:08:02.069
chastity, and of course,
it's a lot more optimistic.

00:08:02.069 --> 00:08:06.780
He believes that a virgin like
the Lady is secure or safe from

00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:10.949
the violent attacks imagined by
his younger brother.

00:08:10.949 --> 00:08:14.500
So look at line 423 of
Comus, where the

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:18.732
elder brother explains that the
chaste Lady can actually travel

00:08:18.732 --> 00:08:21.600
anywhere she pleases utterly
unafraid.

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:25.329
"She may trace huge forests" --
I mean, both of these positions

00:08:25.329 --> 00:08:27.013
[laughs]
are voiced with such

00:08:27.013 --> 00:08:29.360
magnificently hyperbolic
rhetoric:

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:31.949
[She]
may trace huge Forests and

00:08:31.949 --> 00:08:35.570
unharbor'd Heaths,
Infamous Hills and sandy

00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:39.107
perilous wilds,
Where through the sacred rays

00:08:39.107 --> 00:08:41.594
of Chastity,
No savage fierce,

00:08:41.594 --> 00:08:46.399
Bandit or mountaineer
Will dare to soil her Virgin

00:08:46.399 --> 00:08:49.456
purity.
He dismisses his brother's

00:08:49.456 --> 00:08:53.110
entirely practical argument,
because for him chastity is a

00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:56.700
lot more than a simple exercise
of sexual abstinence.

00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:00.806
It's a positive force,
and it exerts an actual and

00:09:00.806 --> 00:09:05.080
somehow palpable,
discernible force in the world.

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:08.914
The "sacred rays of chastity"
are going to be emanating from

00:09:08.914 --> 00:09:12.360
the chaste maiden and protecting
her like some magical

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:15.893
force-field,
and actually will keep her safe

00:09:15.893 --> 00:09:19.835
from the physical assaults of a
savage bandit or a

00:09:19.835 --> 00:09:24.259
mountaineer.Now this is just
a thought exercise,

00:09:24.259 --> 00:09:27.843
but were the Elder Brother to
read The General Chronicle of

00:09:27.843 --> 00:09:30.370
England that Milton had read
in 1639,

00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:34.091
I am assuming he would have
found incoherent the story that

00:09:34.091 --> 00:09:37.620
had so interested Milton:
the story about Saint Ebba,

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:41.645
the nun, who was driven to such
terrible lengths to protect

00:09:41.645 --> 00:09:45.809
herself and her fellow sisters
in the nunnery from attack.

00:09:45.809 --> 00:09:49.124
For the Elder Brother,
Ebba's bodily purity should

00:09:49.124 --> 00:09:52.709
itself exude a sufficiently
powerful strength that the

00:09:52.709 --> 00:09:56.565
terrible Danes would be repelled
by the sacred rays of her

00:09:56.565 --> 00:09:59.390
chastity.
So you get something like a

00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:02.139
conflict developing in Milton's
mask.

00:10:02.139 --> 00:10:06.941
It's a tension between the
extravagant virginal idealism of

00:10:06.941 --> 00:10:11.433
the elder brother and what I
have to concede is a much more

00:10:11.433 --> 00:10:16.235
practical sense of virginity's
limitations voiced by the Second

00:10:16.235 --> 00:10:20.038
Brother.
So Milton is actually staging a

00:10:20.038 --> 00:10:24.862
debate between these two
positions, enacted on the stage

00:10:24.862 --> 00:10:29.159
in 1634 by a nine- and an
eleven-year-old boy,

00:10:29.159 --> 00:10:33.985
I'll remind you.The very
presence in a theatrical piece

00:10:33.985 --> 00:10:38.228
of a long and weighty
philosophical debate like this

00:10:38.228 --> 00:10:43.470
one could easily be seen as
having a pretty tedious effect.

00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:45.120
Milton is taking a pretty great
risk here.

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:50.056
It's worth asking what's at
stake because this is such an

00:10:50.056 --> 00:10:53.716
odd thing to find;
and so I want to consider a way

00:10:53.716 --> 00:10:57.264
in which this debate between
these two brothers can be seen

00:10:57.264 --> 00:11:00.568
as related to other debates and
other conflicts between

00:11:00.568 --> 00:11:04.238
competing aspects of Milton's
own consciousness -- that would

00:11:04.238 --> 00:11:07.419
be one perspective -- and maybe
more grandly,

00:11:07.419 --> 00:11:11.218
between opposing factions in
the culture of

00:11:11.218 --> 00:11:15.649
seventeenth-century England at
large.First,

00:11:15.649 --> 00:11:20.549
though, I need to say a couple
of words about the word

00:11:20.549 --> 00:11:25.975
chastity as I've been using
it throughout the discussion so

00:11:25.975 --> 00:11:30.000
far of Comus both today
and Monday.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.032
Up to this point -- and some of
you may have felt this -- I have

00:11:33.032 --> 00:11:35.583
been throwing the word
chastity around a little

00:11:35.583 --> 00:11:38.860
promiscuously.
In throwing it around with this

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:42.436
kind of looseness,
I've been reproducing what I

00:11:42.436 --> 00:11:46.480
take to be a certain sloppiness
in Milton's text.

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:52.300
I've been speaking of chastity
as if chastity and virginity

00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:57.068
were absolute synonyms,
or always synonyms -- just

00:11:57.068 --> 00:12:02.192
forever interchangeable -- and
this simply isn't true in the

00:12:02.192 --> 00:12:05.980
seventeenth century.
Now it goes without saying that

00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:09.876
we all know what virginity is.
Virginity is that bodily state

00:12:09.876 --> 00:12:13.950
that predates an act of sexual
intercourse and therefore,

00:12:13.950 --> 00:12:16.902
at least for most of Milton's
contemporaries,

00:12:16.902 --> 00:12:21.129
that is the bodily state that
predates marriage.Chastity,

00:12:21.129 --> 00:12:24.549
however, was beginning to mean
something new in the period.

00:12:24.549 --> 00:12:27.833
For a lot of Protestants in the
early seventeenth century,

00:12:27.833 --> 00:12:31.174
the word chastity could
also be used to refer to the

00:12:31.174 --> 00:12:33.824
state of what could be called
married chastity:

00:12:33.824 --> 00:12:37.107
married chastity was a type of
bodily purity that could be

00:12:37.107 --> 00:12:40.391
extended -- or a spiritual
purity as well -- that could be

00:12:40.391 --> 00:12:44.399
extended even into marriage.
This is sort of the theory.

00:12:44.399 --> 00:12:47.432
If a couple practiced
temperate, moderate,

00:12:47.432 --> 00:12:51.870
and more or less dispassionate
acts of sexual intercourse,

00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:55.260
they could be said to remain
chaste -- a married couple,

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:58.003
of course.
They could keep for themselves

00:12:58.003 --> 00:13:01.609
the prestigious title of
"chaste" even though they were

00:13:01.609 --> 00:13:05.549
obviously performing an act that
almost anyone in an earlier

00:13:05.549 --> 00:13:10.090
period would assume disqualified
them from being called chaste.

00:13:10.090 --> 00:13:13.691
And so there opens up a kind of
distinction between virginity,

00:13:13.691 --> 00:13:16.867
which is, of course,
actual physical sexual

00:13:16.867 --> 00:13:21.477
abstinence, and chastity,
which for some could actually

00:13:21.477 --> 00:13:26.939
include the moderate practice of
sex within marriage.It's one

00:13:26.939 --> 00:13:31.719
of the interesting and curious
features of the Protestant

00:13:31.719 --> 00:13:35.283
mask,
Comus, that this is a

00:13:35.283 --> 00:13:40.580
distinction that's never really
observed or acknowledged.

00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:44.441
Virginity and chastity seem to
be used often and kind of

00:13:44.441 --> 00:13:47.110
awkwardly, I think,
interchangeably.

00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:51.404
The confusion between these two
words is closely related,

00:13:51.404 --> 00:13:55.085
I propose, to some of the
confusions and dilemmas

00:13:55.085 --> 00:13:58.000
confronted by the work as a
whole.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.148
I'll go so far as to say that
some of the semantic difficulty

00:14:02.148 --> 00:14:06.020
here in our understanding of the
word chastity has

00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:09.754
something to do with an
indisputably awkward element of

00:14:09.754 --> 00:14:13.212
Comus' plot:
and that's the fact that for so

00:14:13.212 --> 00:14:17.268
much of this mask,
 the Lady is stuck to

00:14:17.268 --> 00:14:22.107
her seat.I mentioned at the
beginning of the lecture that

00:14:22.107 --> 00:14:27.188
Milton would go on to become the
English language's premier poet

00:14:27.188 --> 00:14:30.379
of marriage,
but it's important to note that

00:14:30.379 --> 00:14:33.960
the celebration of marriage is
not at all an obvious thing for

00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:37.365
an English poet in Milton's time
to be attempting to strive

00:14:37.365 --> 00:14:39.079
toward.
And in fact,

00:14:39.079 --> 00:14:43.370
it's just at this point in
early modern England that

00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:48.586
marriage is beginning to assert
itself as a cultural ideal -- a

00:14:48.586 --> 00:14:52.120
religiously inflected cultural
ideal.

00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:55.121
Throughout the Renaissance,
throughout the sixteenth

00:14:55.121 --> 00:14:58.887
century, the popular ideas about
marriage and celibacy were still

00:14:58.887 --> 00:15:02.653
firmly tied to the values of the
Roman Catholic Church well after

00:15:02.653 --> 00:15:05.548
the actual Reformation.
Roman doctrine,

00:15:05.548 --> 00:15:10.381
of course, had prized the state
of celibacy, insisting that it

00:15:10.381 --> 00:15:13.549
was the superior state over
marriage.

00:15:13.549 --> 00:15:16.373
Now, it's true that -- and
this has always been the case --

00:15:16.373 --> 00:15:18.787
that a proper marriage was
obviously always one of the

00:15:18.787 --> 00:15:21.892
church's sacraments,
and marriage obviously had

00:15:21.892 --> 00:15:24.909
always received the church's
blessing;

00:15:24.909 --> 00:15:27.310
but nonetheless the higher
ideal would still seem to be

00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:30.068
celibacy.
It was the ideal embraced by

00:15:30.068 --> 00:15:33.795
priests and nuns,
and it was the ideal to which

00:15:33.795 --> 00:15:38.494
all Christians theoretically at
least were in a position to

00:15:38.494 --> 00:15:43.033
aspire to.
It's in the period in which

00:15:43.033 --> 00:15:49.679
Milton is writing that the tide
is beginning to turn.

00:15:49.679 --> 00:15:53.291
The Protestant Reformation,
and especially the rising

00:15:53.291 --> 00:15:57.320
energies of Puritanism in the
early seventeenth century,

00:15:57.320 --> 00:16:01.000
are beginning to do a lot to
change this state of affairs.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.072
And so over the course of the
century, you can see a gradual

00:16:04.072 --> 00:16:07.039
-- as if something like this
could actually be charted.

00:16:07.039 --> 00:16:09.990
Nonetheless,
I think it's safe to say you

00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:13.477
see a gradual decline in the
cultural idealization of

00:16:13.477 --> 00:16:17.299
virginity and a corresponding
increase in the valuation of

00:16:17.299 --> 00:16:21.323
marriage in this new form of
chastity that we can think of as

00:16:21.323 --> 00:16:24.833
married chastity.
It's a transition,

00:16:24.833 --> 00:16:30.539
an evaluation of marriage that
is not at all an easy one,

00:16:30.539 --> 00:16:32.789
however.
There are debates.

00:16:32.789 --> 00:16:36.362
There are disagreements even
among Puritans about which

00:16:36.362 --> 00:16:40.266
state, virginity or married
chastity, is the superior one in

00:16:40.266 --> 00:16:43.612
the eyes of God.
It's in light of this ongoing

00:16:43.612 --> 00:16:46.680
cultural tension in the period
that, I think,

00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:50.725
we can understand some of the
strange confusions concerning

00:16:50.725 --> 00:16:54.282
chastity that we find in the
poem that we're looking

00:16:54.282 --> 00:16:58.327
at.Now one of the moments in
which this tension between

00:16:58.327 --> 00:17:02.441
virginity and chastity seems to
be most pronounced is in the

00:17:02.441 --> 00:17:06.626
encounter between Comus and the
Lady that we looked at in the

00:17:06.626 --> 00:17:10.349
last class.
Comus attempts to seduce the

00:17:10.349 --> 00:17:14.230
Lady, you'll remember,
with something like an economic

00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:18.339
theory of natural beauty.
For Comus, nature has given us

00:17:18.339 --> 00:17:22.319
all of her riches and it's our
duty, it's our obligation,

00:17:22.319 --> 00:17:26.232
to spend them,
to consume them,

00:17:26.232 --> 00:17:31.710
and to luxuriate in nature's
generosity.

00:17:31.710 --> 00:17:35.423
You could think of this,
and this has actually been

00:17:35.423 --> 00:17:38.469
described by critics,
as something like an

00:17:38.469 --> 00:17:41.960
aristocratic theory of natural
expenditure,

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:46.221
because Comus imagines in this
fantasy rhetorical world of his

00:17:46.221 --> 00:17:50.204
something like an almost endless
supply of natural wealth:

00:17:50.204 --> 00:17:54.047
nature's wealth can continually
and forever be spent and

00:17:54.047 --> 00:17:58.029
expended.Now the Lady
responds to what we can think of

00:17:58.029 --> 00:18:02.221
as his aristocratic debauchery
with an economic theory of her

00:18:02.221 --> 00:18:04.632
own,
and we haven't looked at that

00:18:04.632 --> 00:18:06.178
yet.
So this is line 768 of

00:18:06.178 --> 00:18:09.721
Comus, and in the
Hughes edition it's on

00:18:09.721 --> 00:18:11.789
page 108.
This is the Lady's retort.

00:18:11.789 --> 00:18:15.508
She explains that nature,
of course, wants us to "live

00:18:15.508 --> 00:18:19.297
according to her sober laws /
and holy dictate of spare

00:18:19.297 --> 00:18:22.597
Temperance."
In this description of the

00:18:22.597 --> 00:18:27.955
moderate and temperate enjoyment
of nature, the Lady is giving us

00:18:27.955 --> 00:18:31.640
something like a Puritan
economic theory.

00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:37.775
This is her argument, line 768: 
If every just man that

00:18:37.775 --> 00:18:41.102
now pines with want
Had but a moderate and

00:18:41.102 --> 00:18:44.200
beseeming share
Of that which lewdly-pamper'd

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:47.258
Luxury
Now heaps upon some few with

00:18:47.258 --> 00:18:49.808
vast excess,
Nature's full blessings would

00:18:49.808 --> 00:18:52.831
be well dispens't
In unsuperfluous even

00:18:52.831 --> 00:18:57.015
proportion…
I think it's sometimes hard to

00:18:57.015 --> 00:18:59.851
remember in reading a speech
like this that the Lady is

00:18:59.851 --> 00:19:03.542
actually talking about chastity.
Her argument sounds -- and some

00:19:03.542 --> 00:19:06.470
of you may recognize this
argument -- it sounds so

00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:08.859
distinctly like a political
argument,

00:19:08.859 --> 00:19:10.519
an argument from political
economy.

00:19:10.519 --> 00:19:12.475
It actually,
it's been shown,

00:19:12.475 --> 00:19:16.315
seems to foreshadow the
political philosophy of Milton's

00:19:16.315 --> 00:19:21.280
much younger contemporary,
John Locke -- the notion that

00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:27.220
nature demands that every human
individual has just enough,

00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:30.589
is given just enough to be
self-sufficient.

00:19:30.589 --> 00:19:34.491
But when you remember that the
subject at hand is actually in

00:19:34.491 --> 00:19:37.351
some way sex,
then you can begin to associate

00:19:37.351 --> 00:19:40.928
the Lady's image of this
moderate consumption of natural

00:19:40.928 --> 00:19:44.634
wealth with some version of --
if this makes sense -- some

00:19:44.634 --> 00:19:47.819
version of an act of sexual
consummation.

00:19:47.819 --> 00:19:52.671
The Lady's call for a tempered,
moderate distribution and

00:19:52.671 --> 00:19:57.175
consumption of natural goods
seems to point us toward

00:19:57.175 --> 00:20:01.680
something like a particular
attitude toward sex;

00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:05.447
and if this is sex she's
seeming to refer to,

00:20:05.447 --> 00:20:09.299
it's clearly not virginity
that's at stake.

00:20:09.299 --> 00:20:12.279
This isn't sexual abstinence
that the Lady's pointing to.

00:20:12.279 --> 00:20:16.184
With her vision of the moderate
and temperate enjoyment of

00:20:16.184 --> 00:20:19.336
nature's beauty,
the Lady is sketching this new

00:20:19.336 --> 00:20:22.419
seventeenth-century ideal of
married chastity:

00:20:22.419 --> 00:20:27.055
the ideal of the temperate,
moderate indulgence in sexual

00:20:27.055 --> 00:20:31.151
pleasure, of course,
within the sanctified confines

00:20:31.151 --> 00:20:34.099
of marriage.This makes
sense.

00:20:34.099 --> 00:20:37.503
We have to assume that the Lady
is resisting Comus' advances

00:20:37.503 --> 00:20:40.560
because she has before her the
higher ideal of married

00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:43.428
chastity.
One day she will become a wife

00:20:43.428 --> 00:20:47.878
herself, and it's in her husband
that she will eventually invest

00:20:47.878 --> 00:20:52.952
the talent of her bodily wealth,
to use the metaphor that we get

00:20:52.952 --> 00:20:55.811
from Matthew 25.
It's a perfectly reasonable

00:20:55.811 --> 00:20:58.834
sentiment to include in an
example of the particular genre

00:20:58.834 --> 00:21:00.849
that Milton is writing his mask
in.

00:21:00.849 --> 00:21:04.150
The form of this mask is
that of the romance.

00:21:04.150 --> 00:21:08.444
It's a literary genre that
dates back to late classical

00:21:08.444 --> 00:21:12.182
Greece and which typically
charts the trials and

00:21:12.182 --> 00:21:16.119
tribulations of a hero,
in many cases the trials and

00:21:16.119 --> 00:21:18.420
tribulations of a virginal
heroine.

00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:21.961
The romance heroine is often
threatened with rape,

00:21:21.961 --> 00:21:26.152
but by her cleverness or by
good luck or a concatenation of

00:21:26.152 --> 00:21:30.200
forces she can always invariably
avert that tragedy;

00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:34.390
and by the end of the work she
can present herself to her

00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:38.666
future husband as a virgin.
This last twist is without

00:21:38.666 --> 00:21:43.769
question the central element of
the conventional romance plot,

00:21:43.769 --> 00:21:46.353
and this remains a central
element in the Harlequin

00:21:46.353 --> 00:21:48.420
romances, for example,
that are still,

00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:51.899
I think, consumed so
voraciously even today:

00:21:51.899 --> 00:21:56.350
after her brush with danger,
after her brush with sexual

00:21:56.350 --> 00:21:59.013
peril,
the romance heroine always gets

00:21:59.013 --> 00:22:01.970
married in the end.
The story has to end that way.

00:22:01.970 --> 00:22:05.586
And her marriage is invariably
seen as her reward for all the

00:22:05.586 --> 00:22:08.480
trouble she's been
through.Now given this,

00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:11.280
the romance frame of Milton's
Comus, we're not

00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:14.457
surprised actually to see --
even though we don't see at the

00:22:14.457 --> 00:22:16.450
end her actually getting
married,

00:22:16.450 --> 00:22:19.606
we're not surprised to see the
Lady in this speech embracing

00:22:19.606 --> 00:22:22.335
the form of chastity that
promises something like an

00:22:22.335 --> 00:22:25.289
eventual turn to marriage.
This makes sense.

00:22:25.289 --> 00:22:29.716
And it's with this hint at the
state of married chastity --

00:22:29.716 --> 00:22:33.837
this seems like a healthy
perspective -- it's with this

00:22:33.837 --> 00:22:37.348
hint that the Lady ended her
speech at the only

00:22:37.348 --> 00:22:41.470
seventeenth-century performance
of Comus,

00:22:41.470 --> 00:22:43.205
 which,
as you know,

00:22:43.205 --> 00:22:47.009
took place at Ludlow Castle in
1634 on Michelmas night.

00:22:47.009 --> 00:22:50.990
At this original performance of
the mask,

00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:55.129
the Lady's speech read by
the Lady Alice Egerton,

00:22:55.129 --> 00:22:58.950
age fifteen,
ended at line 779 in your text.

00:22:58.950 --> 00:23:02.932
I think after hearing the Lady
end her speech at line 779 that

00:23:02.932 --> 00:23:06.523
the audience could reasonably
expect that the Lady would

00:23:06.523 --> 00:23:09.617
someday get married.
But you can see from the text

00:23:09.617 --> 00:23:12.619
that you have in your Hughes
editions -- or any edition,

00:23:12.619 --> 00:23:16.113
any printed edition now -- the
speech continues in the version

00:23:16.113 --> 00:23:20.752
of the mask that we have.
While Milton wrote most of the

00:23:20.752 --> 00:23:24.880
mask in 1634,
he published it in 1637,

00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:29.029
and it's at this point three
years later that he seems to

00:23:29.029 --> 00:23:31.920
have inserted into the Lady's
speech,

00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:36.793
and also elsewhere in the poem,
certain lines for the published

00:23:36.793 --> 00:23:39.293
version.
So the Lady's speech in the

00:23:39.293 --> 00:23:42.911
printed version continues at
line 779 and this is what the

00:23:42.911 --> 00:23:45.690
Lady asked.
How can you not love this?

00:23:45.690 --> 00:23:50.839
"Shall I go on?
/ Or have I said enough?"

00:23:50.839 --> 00:23:52.881
Clearly, Milton is in some way
[laughs]

00:23:52.881 --> 00:23:55.300
wonderfully speaking through
the Lady here.

00:23:55.300 --> 00:23:57.290
Then we get the Lady again: 
Shall I go on?

00:23:57.290 --> 00:24:00.269
Or have I said enough?
To him that dares

00:24:00.269 --> 00:24:02.539
Arm his profane tongue with
contemptuous words

00:24:02.539 --> 00:24:05.069
Against the Sun-clad power of
Chastity

00:24:05.069 --> 00:24:09.420
Fain would I something say,
yet to what end?

00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:11.819
Thou hast nor Ear nor Soul to
apprehend

00:24:11.819 --> 00:24:14.799
The sublime notion and high
mystery

00:24:14.799 --> 00:24:17.220
That must be utter'd to unfold
the sage

00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:20.900
And serious doctrine of
virginity.

00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:24.695
She's speaking reluctantly here.
She'd love to tell Comus

00:24:24.695 --> 00:24:29.794
something about chastity,
but he has neither ear nor soul

00:24:29.794 --> 00:24:34.529
to apprehend the sublime notion
and high mystery.

00:24:34.529 --> 00:24:36.973
The speech is proceeding rather
smoothly and,

00:24:36.973 --> 00:24:40.250
I think, kind of explicably as
the Lady defends the sun-clad

00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:43.583
power of chastity.But look
at the end of the passage that

00:24:43.583 --> 00:24:48.279
I've just read,
a few lines down.

00:24:48.279 --> 00:24:52.163
The doctrine that the Lady
wishes to advance suddenly seems

00:24:52.163 --> 00:24:55.980
so absolutely not to be a
doctrine of married chastity.

00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:59.529
It's the sage and serious
doctrine of virginity that

00:24:59.529 --> 00:25:03.308
concludes the speech.
It's clear that something's

00:25:03.308 --> 00:25:08.022
happened between 1634 and 1637.
Milton's Lady doesn't proceed

00:25:08.022 --> 00:25:11.551
as we expect her to,
to marshal further arguments

00:25:11.551 --> 00:25:16.109
for the moderate fulfillment of
one's conjugal obligations.

00:25:16.109 --> 00:25:19.214
There's no more talk of
temperate sex or the virtuous

00:25:19.214 --> 00:25:22.737
and the virtuous moderation
that's so important to the ideal

00:25:22.737 --> 00:25:25.856
of married chastity.
The Lady begins to speak

00:25:25.856 --> 00:25:30.001
instead of the unyielding virtue
of sexual abstinence that's

00:25:30.001 --> 00:25:33.515
absolutely central to an
entirely different kind of

00:25:33.515 --> 00:25:37.449
doctrine: the doctrine of
virginity.So we have to ask

00:25:37.449 --> 00:25:40.119
this question:
What's happened?

00:25:40.119 --> 00:25:43.128
The Lady has claimed that she's
hesitant to say anything at this

00:25:43.128 --> 00:25:45.834
point to Comus.
How could such a debauched

00:25:45.834 --> 00:25:49.915
character possibly understand
the mysterious truths about

00:25:49.915 --> 00:25:52.446
chastity?
Interestingly,

00:25:52.446 --> 00:25:59.311
she refuses to unfold for her
audience the sage and serious

00:25:59.311 --> 00:26:04.123
doctrine of virginity,
but she does anticipate what

00:26:04.123 --> 00:26:08.292
that doctrine of virginity would
look like if she were to unfold

00:26:08.292 --> 00:26:10.211
it.
She explains to Comus what

00:26:10.211 --> 00:26:13.839
would happen should she actually
choose to break her silence,

00:26:13.839 --> 00:26:17.462
should she actually choose to
unleash all of the rhetorical

00:26:17.462 --> 00:26:20.210
powers that she has pent up
inside of her.

00:26:20.210 --> 00:26:22.838
In some important way,
I think, the Lady can be seen

00:26:22.838 --> 00:26:25.364
as being in the same position
that Milton had been

00:26:25.364 --> 00:26:28.200
representing himself in so many
of the early poems.

00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:32.045
He was continually imagining
himself to be someone on the

00:26:32.045 --> 00:26:35.959
verge of saying something
spectacular, but he wasn't quite

00:26:35.959 --> 00:26:38.500
there yet.The lady
continues.

00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:42.891
Look at line 792: 
Thou art not fit to hear

00:26:42.891 --> 00:26:46.053
thyself convinc't;
Yet should I try [and she

00:26:46.053 --> 00:26:49.180
means, "should I try to voice
the doctrine of virginity"],

00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:52.306
the uncontrolled worth
Of this pure cause would

00:26:52.306 --> 00:26:55.515
kindle my raptspirits
To such a flame of sacred

00:26:55.515 --> 00:26:58.311
vehemence,
That dumb things would be mov'd

00:26:58.311 --> 00:27:02.186
to sympathize,
And the brute Earth would lend

00:27:02.186 --> 00:27:05.869
her nerves, and shake,
Till all thy magic structures

00:27:05.869 --> 00:27:08.958
rear'd so high,
Were shatter'd into heaps o'er

00:27:08.958 --> 00:27:13.296
thy false head.
She's making a strong a claim

00:27:13.296 --> 00:27:19.089
as is possible to make for her
potential for rhetorical power.

00:27:19.089 --> 00:27:23.330
She implies that she's the
equal to any of the great poetic

00:27:23.330 --> 00:27:27.330
heroes that Milton so admires.
As a virginal orator,

00:27:27.330 --> 00:27:31.915
should she choose to unleash
her powers, she would have the

00:27:31.915 --> 00:27:36.816
power of an Orpheus moving dumb
things to sympathize -- Orpheus

00:27:36.816 --> 00:27:41.243
being one of Milton's most
prized mythological figures of

00:27:41.243 --> 00:27:44.862
the powerful poet.
She'd have the strength of a

00:27:44.862 --> 00:27:47.678
Samson, the biblical hero,
who could shatter huge

00:27:47.678 --> 00:27:50.259
structures over the heads of his
enemies.

00:27:50.259 --> 00:27:54.282
She has way more power than she
needs, it would seem,

00:27:54.282 --> 00:27:58.924
to destroy a petty little mages
like Comus.The power that

00:27:58.924 --> 00:28:03.180
the Lady claims for herself as a
virgin is titanic,

00:28:03.180 --> 00:28:07.141
and it allows us to understand,
I think, why she has slipped

00:28:07.141 --> 00:28:11.237
from her discussion of married
chastity to this new discussion

00:28:11.237 --> 00:28:15.400
of what seems to be -- or what
she claims is -- virginity.

00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:19.244
The lapse makes a certain kind
of sense, I think,

00:28:19.244 --> 00:28:24.050
because it's virginity and not
married chastity that the Lady

00:28:24.050 --> 00:28:28.456
imagines will allow her to
demonstrate such a remarkable

00:28:28.456 --> 00:28:35.023
show of rhetorical strength.
It's almost apocalyptic in its

00:28:35.023 --> 00:28:38.479
force.
It promises something like the

00:28:38.479 --> 00:28:43.513
power of God as he brings the
shattering close of the entire

00:28:43.513 --> 00:28:49.059
Christian narrative to an end at
the Last Judgment and beyond.

00:28:49.059 --> 00:28:52.041
One of the cultural phenomena
fueling, I think,

00:28:52.041 --> 00:28:55.346
this rhetorical burst of the
Lady's is the prevalent

00:28:55.346 --> 00:28:59.299
seventeenth-century anticipation
of the end of the world,

00:28:59.299 --> 00:29:04.750
the millennium -- all of these
apocalyptic beliefs that were

00:29:04.750 --> 00:29:10.293
swirling around almost all of
the sectarian religious figures

00:29:10.293 --> 00:29:14.728
in the seventeenth
century.Given all of these

00:29:14.728 --> 00:29:19.158
cultural resonances,
there's a lot riding on the

00:29:19.158 --> 00:29:22.539
Lady's claim for her rhetorical
powers here.

00:29:22.539 --> 00:29:25.255
You can understand that initial
hesitation when she asks,

00:29:25.255 --> 00:29:26.950
"Shall I go on?
/ Or have I said enough?"

00:29:26.950 --> 00:29:31.720
She's probably said way more
than enough in her testimony to

00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:36.490
the potentially apocalyptic
power of her virginal speech.

00:29:36.490 --> 00:29:40.900
She's making extraordinary
claims for virginal oratory.

00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:45.139
It has all of the power of
prophecy that Milton had been

00:29:45.139 --> 00:29:48.299
associating with the biblical
prophets;

00:29:48.299 --> 00:29:52.827
but, as I mentioned before,
she doesn't deliver this

00:29:52.827 --> 00:29:57.265
anticipated speech and so
virginity's power remains

00:29:57.265 --> 00:30:00.510
untested.
We can't know just what force

00:30:00.510 --> 00:30:04.042
virginity would exude,
and so the speech leaves us

00:30:04.042 --> 00:30:07.116
where we began,
in a state of uncertainty

00:30:07.116 --> 00:30:11.095
concerning the ultimate strength
of this virtue of sexual

00:30:11.095 --> 00:30:14.495
abstinence.
It leaves us where we began:

00:30:14.495 --> 00:30:18.188
asking what,
finally, what is virginity good

00:30:18.188 --> 00:30:21.454
for?
We're reproducing the problem

00:30:21.454 --> 00:30:25.589
that the two brothers were
rehearsing in their

00:30:25.589 --> 00:30:31.009
debate.So the Lady in the
1637 version of this poem,

00:30:31.009 --> 00:30:34.329
of this mask,
is at an impasse.

00:30:34.329 --> 00:30:41.075
She's stuck between competing
ideals of bodily purity just as

00:30:41.075 --> 00:30:46.809
surely and as firmly as she is
stuck to her seat.

00:30:46.809 --> 00:30:51.144
This is a kind of meta-literary
allegorization that I'll be

00:30:51.144 --> 00:30:54.582
performing here:
you could also think of Milton

00:30:54.582 --> 00:30:58.319
the poet as being stuck at this
same juncture.

00:30:58.319 --> 00:31:01.769
He's stuck between two meanings
of chastity -- chastity as

00:31:01.769 --> 00:31:05.013
absolute virginity,
and chastity as the moderate

00:31:05.013 --> 00:31:08.680
and beseeming sexuality
sanctioned within marriage.

00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:12.310
He's also stuck between two
models of speech with which we

00:31:12.310 --> 00:31:15.049
have become quite familiar by
this point.

00:31:15.049 --> 00:31:18.074
On the one hand,
he wants to wait before he

00:31:18.074 --> 00:31:20.339
talks.
He wants to keep anticipating

00:31:20.339 --> 00:31:23.661
producing the great speech,
which is exactly what the Lady

00:31:23.661 --> 00:31:26.976
has been doing;
but on the other hand Milton's

00:31:26.976 --> 00:31:31.661
possessed of a competing desire
to speak and to speak now -- to

00:31:31.661 --> 00:31:35.440
publish, to succeed,
to consummate his talents.

00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:38.802
It's as if Milton were
paralyzed, almost,

00:31:38.802 --> 00:31:42.922
at this moment in his choice
between these various

00:31:42.922 --> 00:31:47.714
alternatives.Now we know
that the Lady doesn't end the

00:31:47.714 --> 00:31:50.925
mask happily.
Imagine [laughs]

00:31:50.925 --> 00:31:53.809
what it would be like if this
were the case.

00:31:53.809 --> 00:31:56.940
She doesn't end the mask stuck
to Comus' chair.

00:31:56.940 --> 00:31:59.744
It's important to figure out
exactly how the Lady gets

00:31:59.744 --> 00:32:02.759
unstuck, and so that's what
we're going to look at now.

00:32:02.759 --> 00:32:05.355
You'll remember there's first
the bungled attempt by the two

00:32:05.355 --> 00:32:08.802
brothers to release her.
They forget to reverse Comus'

00:32:08.802 --> 00:32:11.660
wand when they rush in to his
lair.

00:32:11.660 --> 00:32:15.386
That didn't pan out.
They had even obtained,

00:32:15.386 --> 00:32:19.041
with the help of the attendant
spirit, the magical herb Haemony

00:32:19.041 --> 00:32:21.400
with all of its Homeric
associations,

00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:24.625
but this, too,
seemed inadequate to the task

00:32:24.625 --> 00:32:29.152
of rescuing their sister.
The Lady is only rescued once

00:32:29.152 --> 00:32:33.380
the attendant spirit calls on
the nymph Sabrina,

00:32:33.380 --> 00:32:37.074
the genius loci --the
natural spirit of the Severn

00:32:37.074 --> 00:32:41.230
stream, which is the river that
separates England from Wales.

00:32:41.230 --> 00:32:45.202
Milton uses for his source for
the character Sabrina another

00:32:45.202 --> 00:32:48.635
character named Sabrina from
Spenser's The Faerie

00:32:48.635 --> 00:32:52.001
Queene.There's a
wonderful work of literary

00:32:52.001 --> 00:32:56.310
criticism -- I mentioned it last
time -- on Milton's indebtedness

00:32:56.310 --> 00:33:00.013
to Spenser in the book by John
Guillory called Poetic

00:33:00.013 --> 00:33:02.872
Authority.
I urge you to look at it if

00:33:02.872 --> 00:33:05.193
you're interested.
The fact that Sabrina,

00:33:05.193 --> 00:33:08.676
this little character here,
has her origin in Spenser is

00:33:08.676 --> 00:33:11.772
important.
Spenser is the great early

00:33:11.772 --> 00:33:15.530
Christian poet in English of
holy matrimony,

00:33:15.530 --> 00:33:19.900
and according to Guillory's
brilliant argument,

00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:24.608
he has the power to counteract
-- Spenser does -- the magical

00:33:24.608 --> 00:33:29.630
effect that Shakespeare wields
through the character of Comus.

00:33:29.630 --> 00:33:32.398
The Lady had claimed for
herself a remarkable set of

00:33:32.398 --> 00:33:34.950
powers, but she wasn't yet ready
to use them.

00:33:34.950 --> 00:33:39.092
She was paralyzed in speech
just as she was prevented from

00:33:39.092 --> 00:33:42.152
even moving.
It was almost as if Sabrina's

00:33:42.152 --> 00:33:46.518
assent from the Severn stream to
assist the Lady in her time of

00:33:46.518 --> 00:33:50.462
need suggests Spenser's arrival
from the realm of English

00:33:50.462 --> 00:33:53.350
literature to assist the young
poet,

00:33:53.350 --> 00:33:56.966
John Milton.
Edmund Spenser arrives,

00:33:56.966 --> 00:34:02.405
arises to help Milton overcome
the paralyzing effect of the

00:34:02.405 --> 00:34:06.812
Comus-like power of
Shakespeare.Let's see if

00:34:06.812 --> 00:34:12.179
this makes any sense.
Look at line 852 of Comus.

00:34:12.179 --> 00:34:16.197
This is page 110 in the
Hughes. The attendant

00:34:16.197 --> 00:34:20.799
spirit explains that Sabrina is
in possession of precious vialed

00:34:20.799 --> 00:34:23.940
liquors that have the capacity
to heal.

00:34:23.940 --> 00:34:27.010
So line 852;
Sabrina can unlock: 

00:34:27.010 --> 00:34:30.119
The clasping charm and
thaw the numbing spell

00:34:30.119 --> 00:34:33.059
If she be right invok't in
warbled Song,

00:34:33.059 --> 00:34:35.909
For maid'nhood she loves,
and will be swift

00:34:35.909 --> 00:34:38.260
To aid a Virgin,
such as was herself,

00:34:38.260 --> 00:34:42.219
In hard-besetting need.
This will I try

00:34:42.219 --> 00:34:46.409
And add the power of some
adjuring verse.

00:34:46.409 --> 00:34:49.917
The power of verse has
everything to do with the power

00:34:49.917 --> 00:34:53.690
wielded by Sabrina to save the
Lady from her paralysis.

00:34:53.690 --> 00:34:58.071
If "right invok't in warbled
Song," Sabrina can actually be

00:34:58.071 --> 00:35:01.470
called down for assistance -- or
called up for

00:35:01.470 --> 00:35:05.699
assistance.It's just this
interest in the right,

00:35:05.699 --> 00:35:08.650
the proper form of warbled song
that's so important here.

00:35:08.650 --> 00:35:12.874
She represents a power that
might enable Milton to warble a

00:35:12.874 --> 00:35:16.811
right or proper song.
She represents a power that

00:35:16.811 --> 00:35:21.419
might enable Milton perhaps
someday actually to fulfill,

00:35:21.419 --> 00:35:25.860
to consummate his
much-anticipated poetic promise.

00:35:25.860 --> 00:35:29.630
But how does she do that?
Look at line 910.

00:35:29.630 --> 00:35:34.662
This is page 111 in the
Hughes. Sabrina says to

00:35:34.662 --> 00:35:38.460
the Lady as she rises from the
water:

00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:42.910
Brightest Lady look on me,
Thus I sprinkle on thy breast

00:35:42.910 --> 00:35:47.940
Drops that from my fountain pure
I have kept of precious cure,

00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:51.810
Thrice upon my finger's tip,
Thrice upon my rubied lip;

00:35:51.810 --> 00:35:58.677
Next this marble venom'd seat
Smear'd with gums of glutinous

00:35:58.677 --> 00:36:02.899
heat
I touch with chaste palms moist

00:36:02.899 --> 00:36:06.472
and cold.
Now, if this a scene,

00:36:06.472 --> 00:36:10.149
as it's been argued,
of Sabrina's baptism of the

00:36:10.149 --> 00:36:13.199
Lady, it's a curious baptism
indeed.

00:36:13.199 --> 00:36:17.065
We might think that Sabrina's
"chaste palms moist and cold"

00:36:17.065 --> 00:36:20.930
would only make more frigid and
more frozen the body of the

00:36:20.930 --> 00:36:24.243
Lady,
but in fact it's just the

00:36:24.243 --> 00:36:28.271
opposite that happens.
Think of the delicate,

00:36:28.271 --> 00:36:32.030
really beautiful sensuality
here in Sabrina's speech.

00:36:32.030 --> 00:36:35.659
I don't think we were expecting
this.

00:36:35.659 --> 00:36:38.750
She evokes the beauty of the
Lady's rubied lip.

00:36:38.750 --> 00:36:42.065
How inappropriate!
The eroticization of the Lady's

00:36:42.065 --> 00:36:46.030
beauty has up to this point come
exclusively from Comus.

00:36:46.030 --> 00:36:49.450
In touching the Lady's
fingertip, it's as if Sabrina

00:36:49.450 --> 00:36:52.938
were awakening for the first
time the Lady's sense of

00:36:52.938 --> 00:36:57.494
touch.Now the Lady,
we know, has an exquisite and

00:36:57.494 --> 00:37:02.036
powerful sense of hearing.
She's a poet and she has an

00:37:02.036 --> 00:37:05.421
impeccable ear,
but this fiercely virginal Lady

00:37:05.421 --> 00:37:09.468
has not up to this point even
begun to develop her other

00:37:09.468 --> 00:37:12.305
sensory realms.
When Sabrina touches the

00:37:12.305 --> 00:37:15.720
surprisingly sensual rubied lip
of the Lady, she's in essence

00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:18.593
baptizing,
I think, and sanctioning the

00:37:18.593 --> 00:37:23.239
erotic drives that the Lady has
been so fiercely repressing.

00:37:23.239 --> 00:37:27.238
She baptizes the entire domain
of non-auditory sensual

00:37:27.238 --> 00:37:30.860
experience that the Lady so
forcefully avoids.

00:37:30.860 --> 00:37:35.369
And you can think of Sabrina as
she touches so gently the Lady

00:37:35.369 --> 00:37:38.770
-- this is [laughs]
to use the wonderful phrase

00:37:38.770 --> 00:37:43.280
that John Guillory used actually
in this very room when I took

00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:46.977
the Milton lecture as an
undergraduate -- that what

00:37:46.977 --> 00:37:51.487
Sabrina is doing is (and this
dates John Guillory -- this is a

00:37:51.487 --> 00:37:55.775
very ‘70s phrase) is
activating the Lady's "erogenous

00:37:55.775 --> 00:38:00.340
zones."
There's something to that.

00:38:00.340 --> 00:38:03.300
With this magical touching of
the Lady with her precious

00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:06.099
liquor, Sabrina saves the Lady
from her paralysis.

00:38:06.099 --> 00:38:10.596
Milton's stage direction should
say it all, it's very simple:

00:38:10.596 --> 00:38:14.793
the lady just "rises out of her
seat."I don't want to

00:38:14.793 --> 00:38:18.840
suggest that Sabrina's work is
purely erotic here.

00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:23.071
There's a lot more than sex
implied in this redemptive

00:38:23.071 --> 00:38:26.667
touching.
In touching the Lady's rubied

00:38:26.667 --> 00:38:30.884
lip, she's also,
I think, releasing the lady's

00:38:30.884 --> 00:38:34.704
hesitation to speak.
After Comus' masterful

00:38:34.704 --> 00:38:39.396
seduction, replete with all its
allusions to the parable of the

00:38:39.396 --> 00:38:43.846
talents from Matthew 25,
the Lady, you'll remember,

00:38:43.846 --> 00:38:47.887
had been so hesitant to speak
("I had not thought to have

00:38:47.887 --> 00:38:51.280
unlocked my lips / in this
unhallowed air").

00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:53.986
When she does unlock her lips
ever so slightly [laughs]

00:38:53.986 --> 00:38:55.739
-- when she does unlock her
lips,

00:38:55.739 --> 00:38:59.386
she does so only to anticipate
the effect that her speeches

00:38:59.386 --> 00:39:02.530
would have if she were to unlock
them even more.

00:39:02.530 --> 00:39:05.880
Everything is entirely
conditional and future-oriented.

00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:10.132
Sabrina's touching of the
Lady's lip seems to unlock,

00:39:10.132 --> 00:39:14.221
perhaps permanently,
the rhetorical hesitation that

00:39:14.221 --> 00:39:19.960
has paralyzed the Lady,
and the Lady is liberated.

00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:23.562
Of course, we have no evidence
of the Lady's rhetorical

00:39:23.562 --> 00:39:26.469
liberation.
There's no further speech on

00:39:26.469 --> 00:39:30.039
her part, but it's an important
action, I think,

00:39:30.039 --> 00:39:36.421
nonetheless.The touching of
the Lady's lip touches us in

00:39:36.421 --> 00:39:41.308
other ways as well though,
at least in this lecture,

00:39:41.308 --> 00:39:45.173
because we remember that
unfortunate, that horrifying

00:39:45.173 --> 00:39:50.079
image of the lip that Milton had
noted in the commonplace book.

00:39:50.079 --> 00:39:54.392
Saint Ebba had not only severed
her nose, she had also severed

00:39:54.392 --> 00:39:56.912
her lip.
I think it's worth thinking

00:39:56.912 --> 00:40:00.874
about, at least for a moment,
of the oddity of this terrible

00:40:00.874 --> 00:40:04.625
act of self-mutilation.
The superfluous action suggests

00:40:04.625 --> 00:40:07.666
that there was something more at
stake, perhaps,

00:40:07.666 --> 00:40:11.289
than Saint Ebba's attempt to
ward off sexual assault.

00:40:11.289 --> 00:40:16.504
To disfigure the mouth -- this
is how I would interpret it --

00:40:16.504 --> 00:40:21.631
to disfigure the mouth has a
primary effect in rendering one

00:40:21.631 --> 00:40:26.540
at least temporarily speechless.
I think there's a connection

00:40:26.540 --> 00:40:30.039
here between the image from the
commonplace book and the

00:40:30.039 --> 00:40:33.346
treatment in Milton's mask of
this strangely conjoint

00:40:33.346 --> 00:40:36.400
phenomenon of virginity and
speechlessness.

00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:38.765
In a little scene from the
early English history that

00:40:38.765 --> 00:40:40.539
Milton had selected from his
reading,

00:40:40.539 --> 00:40:44.244
you have an image of silencing,
of a horrifying and

00:40:44.244 --> 00:40:48.542
unredeemable speechlessness that
is so closely connected to

00:40:48.542 --> 00:40:51.447
virginity.
It would seem to be the

00:40:51.447 --> 00:40:56.483
terrible fate of Saint Ebba to
die both speechless and virginal

00:40:56.483 --> 00:41:00.949
that Milton is struggling to
avoid here.So yeah,

00:41:00.949 --> 00:41:04.210
Comus is a celebration
of virginity,

00:41:04.210 --> 00:41:07.704
and it might even be a
celebration of Milton's

00:41:07.704 --> 00:41:12.130
endlessly anticipatory -- the
mood of imaging himself as a

00:41:12.130 --> 00:41:14.530
great poet.
But these virtues,

00:41:14.530 --> 00:41:17.230
however great,
I think, are also associated in

00:41:17.230 --> 00:41:19.690
the mask with the Lady's
petrifaction,

00:41:19.690 --> 00:41:24.769
her fixation on the seat that
Comus has fashioned for her.

00:41:24.769 --> 00:41:29.188
It's one of the duties of the
mask's plot to get the

00:41:29.188 --> 00:41:32.867
Lady out of her seat.
And you can see in the song

00:41:32.867 --> 00:41:36.081
that Sabrina sings something of
the mechanism,

00:41:36.081 --> 00:41:39.580
perhaps, by which this
transition is effected.

00:41:39.580 --> 00:41:42.969
Look at line 897.
We're almost done here.

00:41:42.969 --> 00:41:46.179
Sabrina rises from the water
and appears gradually on the

00:41:46.179 --> 00:41:49.445
land, making a transition a lot
like the one the Lady will

00:41:49.445 --> 00:41:54.190
eventually have to make.
She sings -- Sabrina sings: 

00:41:54.190 --> 00:41:56.260
Whilst from off the
waters fleet

00:41:56.260 --> 00:42:01.099
Thus I set my printless feet
O'er the Cowslip's Velvet head,

00:42:01.099 --> 00:42:04.250
That bends not as I
tread…

00:42:04.250 --> 00:42:07.238
Now her feet are,
of course, printless because

00:42:07.238 --> 00:42:10.824
she's airy and ethereal,
and she leaves no tread on the

00:42:10.824 --> 00:42:14.610
cowslips or the flowers -- but
this is an odd phrase,

00:42:14.610 --> 00:42:16.980
you'll concede:
"printless feet."

00:42:16.980 --> 00:42:19.858
Its oddness is important.
Feet,

00:42:19.858 --> 00:42:22.626
of course, has a lot of
meanings, and Milton's poetic

00:42:22.626 --> 00:42:25.979
feet, the material of the verse
written in six and eight and ten

00:42:25.979 --> 00:42:30.393
syllables in this poem,
are also in 1634 printless --

00:42:30.393 --> 00:42:35.235
they're unpublished.
When Comus is first performed,

00:42:35.235 --> 00:42:40.776
Milton's poetry hasn't yet been
printed, but it's almost as if

00:42:40.776 --> 00:42:46.045
Sabrina seems to have died
printless or unpublished so that

00:42:46.045 --> 00:42:51.324
Milton wouldn't have to.
It's a sacrifice on our poet's

00:42:51.324 --> 00:42:53.784
behalf.
That would be one literarily

00:42:53.784 --> 00:42:57.480
allegorical way to think of
it.Now as I noted earlier,

00:42:57.480 --> 00:43:00.507
there's a difference between
the two existing texts of

00:43:00.507 --> 00:43:03.202
Milton's Comus.
There's the performance

00:43:03.202 --> 00:43:06.019
version of 1634 and the printed
version of 1637,

00:43:06.019 --> 00:43:09.385
and the additions to the text
that Milton is making for the

00:43:09.385 --> 00:43:12.902
published version reflect,
I think, his sense that he,

00:43:12.902 --> 00:43:15.987
like the Lady,
is in the process of making an

00:43:15.987 --> 00:43:20.515
important transition.
He is no longer -- or no longer

00:43:20.515 --> 00:43:24.922
wants to be -- an infans,
a poetic virgin,

00:43:24.922 --> 00:43:29.797
a speechless poet.
There's also another transition

00:43:29.797 --> 00:43:34.170
that he's making,
and this involves the subject

00:43:34.170 --> 00:43:37.402
of virginity:
not a speechlessness,

00:43:37.402 --> 00:43:42.006
but his actual abstinence.
I'll just point you quickly to

00:43:42.006 --> 00:43:45.039
this passage.
Look at line 1003;

00:43:45.039 --> 00:43:48.518
it's on page 113 in the
Hughes. After we have the

00:43:48.518 --> 00:43:51.933
Lady wandering through the
forest, she joins her father

00:43:51.933 --> 00:43:54.400
with her brothers and we get
this:

00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:56.329
But far above in spangled
sheen

00:43:56.329 --> 00:43:59.230
Celestial Cupid,
her fam'd son advanc't,

00:43:59.230 --> 00:44:02.000
Holds his dear Psyche sweet
entranc't

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:07.469
After her wand'ring labors long,
Till free consent the gods among

00:44:07.469 --> 00:44:11.869
Make her his eternal
bride...

00:44:11.869 --> 00:44:15.668
You can see an image here of
Cupid's eventual marriage to

00:44:15.668 --> 00:44:20.010
Psyche as a pointed reference to
the likelihood that the Lady,

00:44:20.010 --> 00:44:25.349
too, will become someone's
eternal bride.

00:44:25.349 --> 00:44:28.217
In 1634, in the first version,
we didn't have this

00:44:28.217 --> 00:44:30.850
anticipation of the Lady's
future marriage.

00:44:30.850 --> 00:44:35.194
This passage didn't exist.
The Lady remained much more

00:44:35.194 --> 00:44:39.247
fixed in her idealization of
virginity and a lot more silent

00:44:39.247 --> 00:44:42.858
in her responses to Comus,
but it's almost as if the

00:44:42.858 --> 00:44:46.937
prospect of publishing this mask
seems to have induced in Milton

00:44:46.937 --> 00:44:50.498
an interest in trying to move
beyond the idealization of

00:44:50.498 --> 00:44:55.248
virginity,
beyond simply the anticipation

00:44:55.248 --> 00:45:00.027
of future power.
And you're getting to see

00:45:00.027 --> 00:45:06.780
something like an intimation of
John Milton the published poet,

00:45:06.780 --> 00:45:11.036
a poet whose energies are going
to be directed toward making his

00:45:11.036 --> 00:45:13.720
poems public.
The poet of anticipation is

00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:17.309
beginning to think of himself as
the poet of achievement,

00:45:17.309 --> 00:45:20.773
and the poet of the radical
power of virginity is beginning

00:45:20.773 --> 00:45:23.997
to redirect a lot of his
interests to the radical power

00:45:23.997 --> 00:45:27.639
of married sexuality.Now it
won't be until another four or

00:45:27.639 --> 00:45:31.460
five years after the publication
of Comus that Milton will

00:45:31.460 --> 00:45:35.093
himself actually be married,
but the transition from

00:45:35.093 --> 00:45:38.962
virginity to married chastity
charted in this poem that we've

00:45:38.962 --> 00:45:42.573
been looking at nonetheless
reflects a marked interest in

00:45:42.573 --> 00:45:46.571
the nature not only of Milton's
personal life but in the nature

00:45:46.571 --> 00:45:50.888
of his literary interests.
He's beginning to put aside all

00:45:50.888 --> 00:45:54.560
of those literary anxieties
induced by his reading of

00:45:54.560 --> 00:45:57.808
Shakespeare,
and it's as if he's more and

00:45:57.808 --> 00:46:01.949
more willing to use as a kind of
literary assistant,

00:46:01.949 --> 00:46:05.003
or helper, Spenser:
the great poet of holy

00:46:05.003 --> 00:46:07.760
matrimony and married sexual
bliss.

00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:10.279
In the works that Milton is
going to be publishing now with

00:46:10.279 --> 00:46:13.505
greater and greater frequency,
it's this Spenserian ideal of

00:46:13.505 --> 00:46:16.480
marriage that will be the new
and, believe me,

00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:21.624
the endlessly complex Miltonic
subject.Now for next time

00:46:21.624 --> 00:46:25.605
we'll be reading Lycidas,
which is about the death of

00:46:25.605 --> 00:46:27.719
a friend -- and the death of a
friend, in fact,

00:46:27.719 --> 00:46:30.449
who died a virgin,
we have to assume.

00:46:30.449 --> 00:46:34.076
It's not about marriage,
and marriage will still seem

00:46:34.076 --> 00:46:35.960
quite a ways off,
I fear,

00:46:35.960 --> 00:46:38.689
when you read Lycidas,
but we will be marking the

00:46:38.689 --> 00:46:41.219
transition to the poetry of
marriage soon enough.

00:46:41.219 --> 00:46:44.762
This is probably the most
difficult poem linguistically

00:46:44.762 --> 00:46:47.190
that we'll be reading all
semester.

00:46:47.190 --> 00:46:51.124
It repays innumerable readings
and re-readings,

00:46:51.124 --> 00:46:54.803
so I urge you to read it
seventy-five times,

00:46:54.803 --> 00:46:59.080
let's say, before you come to
class on Monday.

00:46:59.080 --> 00:47:00.080
Thank you.

00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:04.588
Prof: I'm going to use
today to actually cover some

00:00:04.588 --> 00:00:05.880
introductory material.
 

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.630
We will use most of the fifty
minutes.

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:16.629
The last part of today's
lecture will describe the

00:00:16.629 --> 00:00:21.650
course, its requirements,
and so forth.

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:23.880
So let's begin.
 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.352
Capitalism--we're going to
break the subject today into

00:00:28.352 --> 00:00:29.760
three headings.
 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.140
Capital, capitalism,
and course, three

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.790
"Cs"
if you will.

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:42.560
The--I've chosen,
and I usually do this,

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.985
I've chosen one segment of the
economy as the theme for the

00:00:46.985 --> 00:00:49.815
day,
and today that segment is

00:00:49.815 --> 00:00:52.020
revealed in this slide.
 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:58.890
Calhoun Athletics XXL,
can you interpret the slide?

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.020
Student:  Green
technology.

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.090
Prof: Okay what in
particular?

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.450
Student: 
&gt;

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:12.120
Prof: Okay,
how about Varic bottled water?

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.360
Student:  Like the crop
circles?

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.030
Prof: Okay,
they are indeed crop circles.

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.989
Score one for MBAs.
 

00:01:21.989 --> 00:01:26.473
They are crop circles,
and all of us who travel from

00:01:26.473 --> 00:01:30.870
east to west across the country
have seen them,

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:34.462
but we haven't seen them quite
in this density because this

00:01:34.462 --> 00:01:38.946
photograph is taken from space,
it's a NASA image,

00:01:38.946 --> 00:01:46.209
and it's an extraordinarily
elegant display of something

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:48.190
very simple.
 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.427
Now why would center pivot
agriculture interest us from the

00:01:52.427 --> 00:01:54.620
point of view of capitalism?
 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.940
The mis-formatted slide here
says capital.

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:02.393
This is a definition that comes
down to us through the Oxford

00:02:02.393 --> 00:02:07.587
English Dictionary from the
early seventeenth century and

00:02:07.587 --> 00:02:12.520
let me read it in full and then
we'll boil it down to more

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.723
manageable terms:
"Capital is the

00:02:15.723 --> 00:02:19.620
accumulated wealth of an
individual,

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.747
company, or community used as a
fund to carry on fresh

00:02:23.747 --> 00:02:27.027
production;
wealth in any form used to help

00:02:27.027 --> 00:02:29.370
in producing more wealth."
 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.680
And there's a shift between
those two meanings.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.878
The first is a very broad
understanding of capital.

00:02:37.878 --> 00:02:42.404
The second is very close to the
way you would have to think

00:02:42.404 --> 00:02:46.848
about capital in connection with
an economic system called

00:02:46.848 --> 00:02:48.020
capitalism.
 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.492
So, let's start with the
broader usage,

00:02:51.492 --> 00:02:56.245
"Capital is accumulated
wealth used as a fund in

00:02:56.245 --> 00:02:59.810
carrying on fresh
production."

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.400
That's a very broad idea.
 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.902
It is one which arguably--in
fact I think without much

00:03:08.902 --> 00:03:12.628
argument,
goes back 10,000 years to the

00:03:12.628 --> 00:03:16.050
establishment of agricultural
society,

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.669
and very possibly another
100,000 or 120,000 years to

00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:25.379
organized hunter gatherers using
weapons and tools.

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:32.449
Does this qualify?
 

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:35.539
Is that not capital?
 

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:38.419
What do you think?
 

00:03:38.419 --> 00:03:43.342
Second row purple--
Student: 

00:03:43.342 --> 00:03:47.020
&gt;
 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:48.788
Prof: It is capital.
 

00:03:48.788 --> 00:03:53.848
Sorry, excuse me,
can you hand her this?

00:03:53.848 --> 00:04:07.699
Student: 
&gt;

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:10.953
Prof: Okay,
so the nuts buried in the

00:04:10.953 --> 00:04:15.569
forest floor are accumulated
wealth, so it meets that test.

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:18.550
Does it meet the next test?
 

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:22.379
You need the mic a little
closer to your mouth.

00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:26.329
Student: 
&gt;

00:04:26.329 --> 00:04:29.101
Prof: Okay so what is
the squirrel producing with that

00:04:29.101 --> 00:04:29.379
nut?
 

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:33.069
Student:  Nothing
material.

00:04:33.069 --> 00:04:37.740
Prof: He's producing
squirrel, and that's not really

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:38.949
what we mean.
 

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:45.850
Hand the mic to somebody else
and we'll just--it's the hot

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:46.940
potato.
 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:51.125
Just pass it around and
wherever it is when I ask a

00:04:51.125 --> 00:04:53.470
question that's your turn.
 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:56.440
That'll be good.
 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:03.848
The nest is producing
nestlings, and it's a little

00:05:03.848 --> 00:05:07.629
closer to what we mean.
 

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:12.701
The beaver dam producing a
working environment for beavers

00:05:12.701 --> 00:05:17.000
to carry out their business;
it's closer.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.310
Infrastructure if you will.
 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:23.528
The honeycomb that bees use.
 

00:05:23.528 --> 00:05:30.685
This one is actually the one
that is closest intuitively to

00:05:30.685 --> 00:05:31.920
capital.
 

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:33.470
Right?
 

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:38.730
The accumulated wealth is the
energy and silk required to

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:44.281
weave the nest or weave the web,
and the web is indeed an

00:05:44.281 --> 00:05:48.430
instrument for the work of
capturing prey,

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:53.829
but there's no external product
beyond it,

00:05:53.829 --> 00:05:57.019
so even that is not quite what
we have in mind.

00:05:57.019 --> 00:05:59.430
Now how about seed?
 

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:01.560
The seeds used in agriculture.
 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:06.079
Where's the--where's the mic
right now?

00:06:06.079 --> 00:06:12.339
Fess up.
 

00:06:12.339 --> 00:06:17.180
Come on in guys.
 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:19.009
No, no, no.
 

00:06:19.009 --> 00:06:20.028
You're not passing it off now.
 

00:06:20.028 --> 00:06:22.771
Okay, so do you reckon that
seeds like this constitute

00:06:22.771 --> 00:06:23.290
capital?
 

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:29.620
Student:  Okay,
I don't really think so,

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:30.310
no.
 

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:32.290
Prof: Okay and why not?
 

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:36.798
Student:  Well,
I guess that a seed produces a

00:06:36.798 --> 00:06:39.512
plant,
but it doesn't really--well I

00:06:39.512 --> 00:06:41.860
guess yeah,
maybe the seed produces a

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:45.180
plant, and then the plant
produces more seeds and it sort

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:47.730
of keeps generating more and
more seeds.

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:49.899
Prof: Is that capital?
 

00:06:49.899 --> 00:06:55.810
Student:  I mean it
doesn't look like it to me.

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:57.300
Prof: Why not?
 

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:58.220
Be exact.
 

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:01.175
Student:  Well I guess
that capital is sort of a

00:07:01.175 --> 00:07:03.750
never-ending way of accumulating
more wealth.

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:05.230
Prof: Does it have to go
on forever?

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:07.850
Don't capitalists fail?
 

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:09.476
Student:  Yeah
capitalists fail,

00:07:09.476 --> 00:07:10.720
but good capitalists don't.
 

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:16.420
Prof: Take Mory's,
it's a pretty good example.

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:19.040
It's a really good example,
actually.

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:21.680
Okay, mic please.
 

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:28.079
In this bucket I've got two
kilograms of seed.

00:07:28.079 --> 00:07:36.389
Would anybody say that it isn't
enough to count as capital?

00:07:36.389 --> 00:07:41.413
If--is one seed,
is that enough to make it

00:07:41.413 --> 00:07:42.639
capital?
 

00:07:42.639 --> 00:07:45.738
Student:  What kind of
seeds?.

00:07:45.738 --> 00:07:48.985
Prof: It's--
Student:  I said what

00:07:48.985 --> 00:07:49.889
kind of seed is it?
 

00:07:49.889 --> 00:07:54.990
Prof: Okay,
it is for growing safflower.

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:57.483
If you elicit information from
me you've got to give me

00:07:57.483 --> 00:07:58.269
something back.
 

00:07:58.269 --> 00:08:02.043
Student:  I think seeds
in any quantity can be capital

00:08:02.043 --> 00:08:05.817
because each--once you plant it
and if there isn't successful

00:08:05.817 --> 00:08:10.208
pollination--
Prof: Is the voice loud

00:08:10.208 --> 00:08:11.620
enough here?
 

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:13.004
Student:
You can always use plants to

00:08:13.004 --> 00:08:13.649
produce more seed.
 

00:08:13.649 --> 00:08:16.524
In fact, that's what a lot of
farms do and that's what a lot

00:08:16.524 --> 00:08:19.350
of farms get in trouble for
because other companies want to

00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:20.519
control those seeds.
 

00:08:20.519 --> 00:08:23.656
Prof: Okay,
so there's a patent violation

00:08:23.656 --> 00:08:27.528
issue if I use hybrid seed to
generate more hybrid seed?

00:08:27.528 --> 00:08:30.009
There may be,
there's an argument there.

00:08:30.009 --> 00:08:33.309
Okay, so quantity doesn't
matter at all?

00:08:33.309 --> 00:08:34.759
Yes.
 

00:08:34.759 --> 00:08:37.293
Student:  I'd say
quantity matters if you're a

00:08:37.293 --> 00:08:40.072
subsistence farmer because if
you just have enough seed to

00:08:40.072 --> 00:08:42.008
feed yourself,
that's not capital that's just

00:08:42.008 --> 00:08:43.615
keeping you alive,
you're not producing any

00:08:43.615 --> 00:08:44.548
further wealth from it.
 

00:08:44.548 --> 00:08:48.340
Prof: Okay and if I gave
you just this much seed?

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:51.158
Student:  Well if I'm
not a farmer,

00:08:51.158 --> 00:08:54.067
if I have some other means of
supporting myself that could be

00:08:54.067 --> 00:08:56.634
capital for a side business but
that wouldn't be for a

00:08:56.634 --> 00:08:57.750
subsistence farmer.
 

00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:00.493
Prof: You think it's
really worth having a business

00:09:00.493 --> 00:09:02.129
over twenty-six safflower seeds?
 

00:09:02.129 --> 00:09:04.139
Student:  Well no.
 

00:09:04.139 --> 00:09:06.639
Prof: No,
I don't think so either.

00:09:06.639 --> 00:09:11.341
What I'm driving at here is the
notion of minimum efficient

00:09:11.341 --> 00:09:11.990
scale.
 

00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:17.272
Capital gets--a resource gets
to be capital only when it's

00:09:17.272 --> 00:09:22.369
aggregated to a scale where it
can be effectively enough

00:09:22.369 --> 00:09:26.538
deployed to compete in an actual
economy.

00:09:26.538 --> 00:09:33.610
Now let's take--that's too big
a note, let's take a dollar.

00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:42.450
Have I just given you capital
or not?

00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:47.738
Student:  Technically
yes, but probably that wouldn't

00:09:47.738 --> 00:09:52.220
allow me to set up a budding
business over here.

00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:54.653
Prof: Okay,
how might it become a piece of

00:09:54.653 --> 00:09:55.158
capital?
 

00:09:55.158 --> 00:09:57.418
Student:  Well if
somebody else gives me a dollar

00:09:57.418 --> 00:09:57.830
or more.
 

00:09:57.830 --> 00:10:00.336
Prof: Two dollars is
enough for you to call it

00:10:00.336 --> 00:10:00.820
capital?
 

00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:03.653
Student:  No,
but if I have more investors

00:10:03.653 --> 00:10:06.308
and they will be giving more
than a dollar.

00:10:06.308 --> 00:10:11.051
Prof: Okay,
so you need some aggregation or

00:10:11.051 --> 00:10:12.600
agglomeration.
 

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:17.120
How do we aggregate capital in
an actual economy?

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:19.399
Student:  IPOs.
 

00:10:19.399 --> 00:10:21.750
Prof: IPOs are a big way
to do it.

00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:26.129
In general, the joint stock
corporation is a way to do it.

00:10:26.129 --> 00:10:27.720
How do banks aggregate capital?
 

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:29.360
Student:  Deposits.
 

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:37.500
Prof: Thousands of
little deposits make big funds.

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:43.927
Okay, so we're getting there
with capital and what I want to

00:10:43.927 --> 00:10:49.809
do now is continue the
agricultural theme and see if we

00:10:49.809 --> 00:10:55.802
can relate what we're talking
about to the generation of

00:10:55.802 --> 00:10:59.179
actual wealth in society.
 

00:10:59.179 --> 00:11:04.090
This is called a seed drill.
 

00:11:04.090 --> 00:11:09.057
It is a way of planting
millions of seeds in a very

00:11:09.057 --> 00:11:13.629
systematic, precise,
and cost effective way.

00:11:13.629 --> 00:11:18.610
One characteristic feature of
how capital works is combining

00:11:18.610 --> 00:11:23.254
different factors in the
production of the same thing in

00:11:23.254 --> 00:11:26.038
an extremely intelligent way.
 

00:11:26.038 --> 00:11:30.535
A way that represents the
accumulated experience of

00:11:30.535 --> 00:11:36.110
society and when you do it well
you succeed, and when you do it

00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:37.908
poorly you fail.
 

00:11:37.908 --> 00:11:41.182
You can actually fail even when
you do it well,

00:11:41.182 --> 00:11:45.450
but you're very unlikely to
succeed when you do it poorly.

00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:51.678
Now here I want to compare two
very similar technologies,

00:11:51.678 --> 00:11:59.672
this is a peasant farming in
Tibet and the mode of power here

00:11:59.672 --> 00:12:04.798
is a pair of yaks,
and this is a John Deere

00:12:04.798 --> 00:12:10.133
tractor and the spectacular
difference between these two

00:12:10.133 --> 00:12:13.139
things is obvious to us all.
 

00:12:13.139 --> 00:12:17.684
It is that one of them
is--constitutes a large

00:12:17.684 --> 00:12:20.110
investment of capital.
 

00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:24.668
In the case of that tractor and
the gear with it well over

00:12:24.668 --> 00:12:26.908
$100,000 must be invested.
 

00:12:26.908 --> 00:12:32.610
The yaks, well I don't know
what yaks cost in Tibet,

00:12:32.610 --> 00:12:33.840
but less.
 

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:39.110
We would say that the John
Deere photograph represents

00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:44.678
something that's capital
intensive and the yak photograph

00:12:44.678 --> 00:12:49.649
represents something which is
labor intensive.

00:12:49.649 --> 00:12:57.947
We would expect a much higher
return in food generated per

00:12:57.947 --> 00:13:06.097
hour of labor invested from the
highly mechanized capital

00:13:06.097 --> 00:13:09.009
intensive story.
 

00:13:09.009 --> 00:13:16.139
In the history of the world in
the last thousand years is

00:13:16.139 --> 00:13:23.269
essentially the history of
substitution of the right hand

00:13:23.269 --> 00:13:29.173
picture for the left hand;
of capital intensive,

00:13:29.173 --> 00:13:34.929
highly mechanized means of
production in the place of labor

00:13:34.929 --> 00:13:40.190
intensive, low capitalization
means of production.

00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:52.538
Another comparison,
the capital intensivity here,

00:13:52.538 --> 00:13:58.100
the ratio of that watering cans
capital cost to the center pivot

00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:03.394
that might be as much as 500
meters long would be measured in

00:14:03.394 --> 00:14:06.732
the thousands to one,
the tens of thousands,

00:14:06.732 --> 00:14:08.440
the hundreds of thousands
probably;

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:12.710
enormous difference in the
level of investment.

00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:16.910
Also those of you who are
interested in the environment,

00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:20.960
and all of us should be,
there is a huge difference in

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:22.870
environmental impact.
 

00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:28.216
The labor intensive agriculture
essentially leaves the

00:14:28.216 --> 00:14:32.629
environment unchanged,
whereas, this kind of

00:14:32.629 --> 00:14:37.517
agriculture practiced in--
it's now a world--center pivot

00:14:37.517 --> 00:14:40.629
irrigation is a worldwide
technology.

00:14:40.629 --> 00:14:45.230
And in many places it draws so
much water so fast,

00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:50.861
and so much water is lost to
evaporation, that the underlying

00:14:50.861 --> 00:14:54.428
aquifer is rapidly being
depleted.

00:14:54.428 --> 00:15:01.913
Here are two center pivot
photographs, and they too differ

00:15:01.913 --> 00:15:04.538
in capitalization.
 

00:15:04.538 --> 00:15:11.589
The one on the left is from
Egypt, the one on the right is

00:15:11.589 --> 00:15:19.009
from Iowa, and the difference
between them in the cost of the

00:15:19.009 --> 00:15:22.350
land would be dramatic.
 

00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:28.586
The market price of highly
productive loam soil in one of

00:15:28.586 --> 00:15:34.825
the three or four richest
agricultural zones in the world

00:15:34.825 --> 00:15:40.951
is much higher than in the
margin of the world's largest

00:15:40.951 --> 00:15:42.399
desert.
 

00:15:42.399 --> 00:15:50.061
Here's another--I kind of got
carried away with center pivot

00:15:50.061 --> 00:15:51.879
agriculture.
 

00:15:51.879 --> 00:15:56.990
Here's another slide of the
same kind from the same source,

00:15:56.990 --> 00:15:59.899
and this is in Southern France.
 

00:15:59.899 --> 00:16:01.610
Who's been to Southern France?
 

00:16:01.610 --> 00:16:06.538
Pretty great isn't it?
 

00:16:06.538 --> 00:16:11.744
I have many reservations about
French politics but Southern

00:16:11.744 --> 00:16:16.500
France is one of the nicest
places I've ever been,

00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:21.366
and this summer--we'll meet a
guy here in a month named Paolo

00:16:21.366 --> 00:16:26.054
Zannoni,
who is a robber baron Goldman

00:16:26.054 --> 00:16:30.623
Sachs partner,
and he just built a villa

00:16:30.623 --> 00:16:34.580
overlooking Cannes in Southern
France,

00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:37.529
and I had to be taken away by
security.

00:16:37.529 --> 00:16:44.870
What's striking about this
photograph in comparison with

00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:48.894
the others--
what's the dramatic difference

00:16:48.894 --> 00:16:51.769
between this one and the
Egyptian one,

00:16:51.769 --> 00:16:53.149
and the Iowa one?
 

00:16:53.149 --> 00:16:59.840
Purple?
 

00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:01.990
That's not what I'm fishing for
guys.

00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:05.660
Student:  There's other
things in the middle.

00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:09.541
Prof: Okay you got to
talk really--where's--do I have

00:17:09.541 --> 00:17:10.200
the mic?
 

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:12.950
Here it is.
 

00:17:12.950 --> 00:17:23.180
Would you please pass this over
to him?

00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:27.400
Student:  There's other
things in the middle of the

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:29.400
green and purple circles.
 

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:31.630
Prof: Push the on button
and it'll be on.

00:17:31.630 --> 00:17:33.946
Student: Alright,
there's other things in the

00:17:33.946 --> 00:17:35.808
middle of the green and purple
circles.

00:17:35.808 --> 00:17:40.190
Prof: Okay,
and what are the other things?

00:17:40.190 --> 00:17:42.529
Student:  I can't tell
if they're houses or--

00:17:42.529 --> 00:17:43.588
Prof: Well what are all
these little polygons?

00:17:43.588 --> 00:17:45.828
Look at the right margin,
for example.

00:17:45.828 --> 00:17:54.108
They are--take a guess,
they're not soccer fields.

00:17:54.108 --> 00:17:57.650
Who wants to take a guess at
this?

00:17:57.650 --> 00:17:59.069
Yes.
 

00:17:59.069 --> 00:18:01.250
Student:  Pasture.
 

00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:04.519
Prof: Pasture?
 

00:18:04.519 --> 00:18:05.588
Okay they might be pasture.
 

00:18:05.588 --> 00:18:09.540
What they are more
generally--you have the--we'll

00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:13.410
get better at this microphone
thing as we go.

00:18:13.410 --> 00:18:17.440
What they are is very small
farms.

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:23.903
They're farms where the leaps
and bounds trace back perhaps

00:18:23.903 --> 00:18:26.578
800,1,000,1,200 years.
 

00:18:26.578 --> 00:18:32.018
They were farms which worked
economically when the world was

00:18:32.018 --> 00:18:36.720
less developed in capital
intensive agriculture,

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:42.696
but they have been rendered
marginal by the transformation

00:18:42.696 --> 00:18:45.108
of world agriculture.
 

00:18:45.108 --> 00:18:49.880
Now the question for you--are
you ready for a policy question?

00:18:49.880 --> 00:19:00.318
Okay, your name is now Sarkozy,
and the question is,

00:19:00.318 --> 00:19:05.201
should we increase--let's
suppose that 20% of these farms

00:19:05.201 --> 00:19:08.970
are failing a year,
and we're already subsidizing

00:19:08.970 --> 00:19:10.308
them pretty heavily.
 

00:19:10.308 --> 00:19:15.441
Should we subsidize them more
so that the rate at which they

00:19:15.441 --> 00:19:17.789
close down is diminished?
 

00:19:17.789 --> 00:19:24.308
Mr.***Sarkozy?
 

00:19:24.308 --> 00:19:27.478
Student:  I would say if
you really want to effectively

00:19:27.478 --> 00:19:30.335
decrease the rate at which
they're failing you'd want to

00:19:30.335 --> 00:19:31.788
encourage consolidation.
 

00:19:31.788 --> 00:19:34.710
It looks like the problem here
is real fragmentation.

00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:37.709
Prof: Okay,
the problem is fragmentation,

00:19:37.709 --> 00:19:39.558
that's a really good start.
 

00:19:39.558 --> 00:19:47.275
Now the person immediately to
your right is your political

00:19:47.275 --> 00:19:53.023
consultant,
and she's going to tell you

00:19:53.023 --> 00:20:01.588
whether what you just said is
going to wash in Lyon or not.

00:20:01.588 --> 00:20:07.837
How's the Sarkozy consolidation
program, how's that going to

00:20:07.837 --> 00:20:08.578
play?
 

00:20:08.578 --> 00:20:10.769
Student:  Can you repeat
the question?

00:20:10.769 --> 00:20:15.755
Prof: Okay,
Sarkozy just said these little

00:20:15.755 --> 00:20:21.468
fragments of land are an
extremely inefficient way to do

00:20:21.468 --> 00:20:23.130
agriculture.
 

00:20:23.130 --> 00:20:26.890
He/she was right on that point.
 

00:20:26.890 --> 00:20:31.536
She goes on to say that we
should try to capture the scale

00:20:31.536 --> 00:20:36.019
economies of big fields by
consolidating agriculture.

00:20:36.019 --> 00:20:41.960
Now you are a public official
subject to election.

00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:48.190
What--how is that going to read
for you, that statement that we

00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:54.420
should announce the Sarkozy
Agricultural Consolidation Plan?

00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:58.435
Student:  I don't think
that the public would like it,

00:20:58.435 --> 00:21:00.108
like the small farmers.
 

00:21:00.108 --> 00:21:02.371
Prof: The small farmers
would hate it,

00:21:02.371 --> 00:21:05.403
and do the small farmers play a
special role in the life and

00:21:05.403 --> 00:21:06.740
imagination of France?
 

00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:09.049
Student:  Yes.
 

00:21:09.049 --> 00:21:10.750
Prof: Yes.
 

00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:14.930
Okay so probably it won't
happen and France--

00:21:14.930 --> 00:21:19.240
this is a characteristic fact
about all the capitalist

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:23.550
democracies is that pressure
groups play an enormously

00:21:23.550 --> 00:21:26.480
important role in actual policy.
 

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:29.936
The one book,
which is available for purchase

00:21:29.936 --> 00:21:32.845
at Labyrinth,
but which isn't actually

00:21:32.845 --> 00:21:36.775
required, is Christopher
Buckley's Thank You For

00:21:36.775 --> 00:21:38.190
Smoking.
 

00:21:38.190 --> 00:21:40.640
How many of you have read this
book?

00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:44.369
Student:  Probably
watched the movie.

00:21:44.369 --> 00:21:44.509
Prof: Pardon?
 

00:21:44.509 --> 00:21:46.500
Student:  The movie.
 

00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:48.180
Prof: Oh, the movie!
 

00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:49.299
How many of you have seen the
movie?

00:21:49.299 --> 00:21:54.240
Books!
 

00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:59.923
It's all about the biases of
pressure groups and public

00:21:59.923 --> 00:22:05.500
relations in the capitalist--in
the largest capitalist

00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:08.868
democracy, which is our own.
 

00:22:08.868 --> 00:22:16.160
I just couldn't resist throwing
this one in,

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:21.960
this is the Libyan Desert and
center pivot agriculture plus

00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:25.558
maybe something else that
uncles--

00:22:25.558 --> 00:22:29.900
observers from the sky found
interesting.

00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:37.259
Okay so a general theme here,
Strategy A / Strategy B.

00:22:37.259 --> 00:22:40.868
Strategy A is labor intensive
production.

00:22:40.868 --> 00:22:43.858
Strategy B is capital intensive
production.

00:22:43.858 --> 00:22:49.923
The single biggest story,
and I'm repeating myself here

00:22:49.923 --> 00:22:56.673
because it's such a big point,
in recent world history is the

00:22:56.673 --> 00:23:01.140
substitution of Strategy B for
Strategy A,

00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:06.680
and that happening on an
extremely uneven basis.

00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:11.618
It's happening in a big way and
fast some places,

00:23:11.618 --> 00:23:14.720
and in a little way and slow
other places,

00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:19.759
and that generates an enormous
vertical dimension to the world.

00:23:19.759 --> 00:23:25.186
There are income ratios between
households measured in the

00:23:25.186 --> 00:23:27.955
millions,
millions to one,

00:23:27.955 --> 00:23:33.953
and that provides some of the
interest in the functioning of

00:23:33.953 --> 00:23:38.529
capitalism which brings us to
the subject.

00:23:38.529 --> 00:23:47.910
Now comparing labor intensive,
the red arrow,

00:23:47.910 --> 00:23:50.250
with capital intensive,
the blue arrow,

00:23:50.250 --> 00:23:53.844
we have here a very simple
production function where labor

00:23:53.844 --> 00:23:56.240
expended is on the horizontal
axis,

00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:59.858
and units produced is on the
vertical.

00:23:59.858 --> 00:24:02.480
For those of who are actually
taking this course,

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:07.278
these slides I posted them just
before class and so if you--

00:24:07.278 --> 00:24:10.868
you can just--you don't have to
write this stuff down.

00:24:10.868 --> 00:24:21.020
If you project differences in
rates of return over long

00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:24.443
periods,
here I've put 100 production

00:24:24.443 --> 00:24:28.778
cycles,
and one curve is increasing at

00:24:28.778 --> 00:24:33.446
1%, the red one,
the other is increasing at 4%

00:24:33.446 --> 00:24:37.565
per cycle,
and by the end of the period

00:24:37.565 --> 00:24:44.326
there is a monstrous difference
in the rate at which they are

00:24:44.326 --> 00:24:46.130
accumulating.
 

00:24:46.130 --> 00:24:52.720
In actual fact very small
differences, I've greatly

00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:59.308
overstated them in the
production function here.

00:24:59.308 --> 00:25:05.173
The difference between 4% and
3%, or between 2.5% and 1%,

00:25:05.173 --> 00:25:11.038
are enormously consequential
when projected over time.

00:25:11.038 --> 00:25:15.217
And at a given moment in time,
are enormously consequential

00:25:15.217 --> 00:25:17.808
from a competitive point of
view,

00:25:17.808 --> 00:25:22.420
because if you are not the low
cost producer,

00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:28.316
the low cost producer is in a
position where if she has

00:25:28.316 --> 00:25:32.942
sufficient scale of operation,
she can drive you out of

00:25:32.942 --> 00:25:33.368
business.
 

00:25:33.368 --> 00:25:41.782
Now everything we've said so
far could be true of almost any

00:25:41.782 --> 00:25:44.348
economic system.
 

00:25:44.348 --> 00:25:49.650
I put the grass here to suggest
Tang, China.

00:25:49.650 --> 00:25:52.901
This was one of the great
periods in Chinese cultural and

00:25:52.901 --> 00:25:55.457
economic history,
ending more than a thousand

00:25:55.457 --> 00:25:56.269
years ago.
 

00:25:56.269 --> 00:26:02.269
The use of capital,
not necessarily in the highly

00:26:02.269 --> 00:26:07.250
intensive form,
but the use of capital in this

00:26:07.250 --> 00:26:12.351
economic cycle we're talking
about was a perfectly normal

00:26:12.351 --> 00:26:18.180
practice which the Tang Dynasty
would have understood easily.

00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:22.609
They were, by the way,
just as inventive as we have

00:26:22.609 --> 00:26:26.420
been in the last couple of
hundred years.

00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:30.368
What they didn't have was the
ability to go to scale.

00:26:30.368 --> 00:26:35.221
Or it could have been as
suggested in this Bruegel

00:26:35.221 --> 00:26:38.843
painting,
we could be thinking of Europe

00:26:38.843 --> 00:26:43.627
in the fifteenth century or the
sixteenth century before the

00:26:43.627 --> 00:26:48.575
capitalist revolution because
there was always the reliance on

00:26:48.575 --> 00:26:49.630
capital.
 

00:26:49.630 --> 00:26:54.592
Lower levels of intensivity
because there was less capital

00:26:54.592 --> 00:26:55.548
in total.
 

00:26:55.548 --> 00:27:00.337
And it could even have been,
we could even be talking about

00:27:00.337 --> 00:27:04.548
an agricultural cooperative in
the Soviet Union,

00:27:04.548 --> 00:27:16.618
which used capital in the form
of tractors and land,

00:27:16.618 --> 00:27:21.423
and seed, and so on,
but used it in a very different

00:27:21.423 --> 00:27:25.380
way than it is used in market
economies.

00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:30.430
Two: capitalism.
 

00:27:30.430 --> 00:27:38.890
Let's switch now to the lower
usage here.

00:27:38.890 --> 00:27:45.220
It is the use of accumulated
wealth to produce more wealth.

00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:52.807
Marx makes a big point of this
wealth, commodity,

00:27:52.807 --> 00:27:59.448
wealth--WCW--and sees this as
pathological,

00:27:59.448 --> 00:28:05.140
as a distortion of human
values.

00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:10.380
And we'll talk through Marx in
about a week or ten days.

00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:17.991
The great man--how many of you
have read as many as ten pages

00:28:17.991 --> 00:28:20.528
of Marx's writing?
 

00:28:20.528 --> 00:28:24.880
Where do we read Marx at Yale
these days?

00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:27.470
Student:  Philosophy.
 

00:28:27.470 --> 00:28:29.079
Prof: Philosophy
department.

00:28:29.079 --> 00:28:30.170
Where else?
 

00:28:30.170 --> 00:28:30.778
Student:  Sociology.
 

00:28:30.778 --> 00:28:31.319
Professor Douglas W.
 

00:28:31.319 --> 00:28:32.608
Rae:  Directed studies.
 

00:28:32.608 --> 00:28:35.328
What is directed studies read
of Marx?

00:28:35.328 --> 00:28:35.529
Student: 
&gt;

00:28:35.529 --> 00:28:38.588
Prof: "Communist
Manifesto";

00:28:38.588 --> 00:28:40.519
that's great,
you're well prepared for this

00:28:40.519 --> 00:28:42.769
class because we're going to
read it next week.

00:28:42.769 --> 00:28:46.500
What would you say of Marx as a
writer?

00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:51.515
First of all he wrote in
German, but who's got an

00:28:51.515 --> 00:28:55.799
editorial opinion about Marx's
writing?

00:28:55.799 --> 00:28:59.470
Yes.
 

00:28:59.470 --> 00:29:01.549
Student:  I think--
Prof: You've got to

00:29:01.549 --> 00:29:02.400
shout without the mic.
 

00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:03.730
Student:  A very
talented writer.

00:29:03.730 --> 00:29:04.920
Prof: A very talented
writer.

00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:08.078
I agree;
a very smart guy.

00:29:08.078 --> 00:29:14.415
If you were marking a Marx term
paper up, what would you find

00:29:14.415 --> 00:29:15.788
fault with?
 

00:29:15.788 --> 00:29:20.390
Student:  A bit
long-winded.

00:29:20.390 --> 00:29:24.357
Prof: Very windy and a
little overwrought,

00:29:24.357 --> 00:29:25.019
right?
 

00:29:25.019 --> 00:29:30.095
He really wants to hit you in
the face five times with each

00:29:30.095 --> 00:29:30.970
thought.
 

00:29:30.970 --> 00:29:37.220
But what we'll discover is
interesting is that Marx,

00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:40.285
in the Manifesto,
Marx and Engels,

00:29:40.285 --> 00:29:45.673
look at capitalism in a way
very similar to the way we look

00:29:45.673 --> 00:29:47.160
at it today.
 

00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:52.673
They emphasize its enormous
productive capacity and they

00:29:52.673 --> 00:29:58.586
also emphasize that it is always
on the edge of being out of

00:29:58.586 --> 00:29:59.788
control.
 

00:29:59.788 --> 00:30:05.000
Capitalism, as a word,
comes into the English language

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:10.701
in the middle of the 1800s,
and it comes in because of Marx

00:30:10.701 --> 00:30:13.160
and people like Marx.
 

00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:19.845
It is a pejorative used to
attack the existing economic

00:30:19.845 --> 00:30:20.960
system.
 

00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:26.852
Capitalism is seen not as a
highly productive system but as

00:30:26.852 --> 00:30:31.423
an unjust system,
and it's criticized in other

00:30:31.423 --> 00:30:35.589
ways which I'll tick off in a
moment.

00:30:35.589 --> 00:30:37.480
Anybody recognize this fellow?
 

00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:39.410
Yes.
 

00:30:39.410 --> 00:30:40.069
Student:  J.P.***Morgan.
 

00:30:40.069 --> 00:30:42.108
Prof: It's J.P.
 

00:30:42.108 --> 00:30:46.690
Morgan and does anybody know
who took this photograph?

00:30:46.690 --> 00:30:48.750
That's a little hard;
Steichen.

00:30:48.750 --> 00:30:50.289
And it's a very famous
photograph.

00:30:50.289 --> 00:30:51.890
What's famous about it?
 

00:30:51.890 --> 00:30:56.089
What does--what's striking
about this image?

00:30:56.089 --> 00:31:00.298
Student:  His face.
 

00:31:00.298 --> 00:31:03.309
Prof: Does he look
friendly, warm and fuzzy?

00:31:03.309 --> 00:31:05.750
No, and he wasn't.
 

00:31:05.750 --> 00:31:07.598
I mean this was a very hard
edge guy.

00:31:07.598 --> 00:31:12.359
What seems to be in his left
hand?

00:31:12.359 --> 00:31:14.950
Student:  A chair.
 

00:31:14.950 --> 00:31:18.789
Prof: It is a chair--it
is the arm of a chair,

00:31:18.789 --> 00:31:23.369
but the reflection makes it
look like he's holding a dagger.

00:31:23.369 --> 00:31:26.910
It was no accident.
 

00:31:26.910 --> 00:31:33.505
Steichen was not a fan and this
has been used--this photograph's

00:31:33.505 --> 00:31:38.740
been used thousands of times in
a polemical way.

00:31:38.740 --> 00:31:44.298
Okay, capitalism as seen in the
nineteenth century.

00:31:44.298 --> 00:31:49.880
A disease for which scientific
socialism, that's Marx's term

00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:52.150
for Marx, is the cure.
 

00:31:52.150 --> 00:31:57.266
Of course there were twenty or
thirty other brands of socialism

00:31:57.266 --> 00:32:00.318
that Marx regarded as
unscientific.

00:32:00.318 --> 00:32:05.153
It is a method by which to
steal the labor from the

00:32:05.153 --> 00:32:06.990
exploited masses.
 

00:32:06.990 --> 00:32:11.660
The reasoning,
which we'll review in ten days

00:32:11.660 --> 00:32:15.435
time,
is that capital can never make

00:32:15.435 --> 00:32:20.900
money except by using either
labor now or the accumulated

00:32:20.900 --> 00:32:26.568
fruit of labor from the past,
and if capital ends up with a

00:32:26.568 --> 00:32:29.893
profit,
that profit must be extracted

00:32:29.893 --> 00:32:33.430
from either living or fossilized
labor.

00:32:33.430 --> 00:32:37.430
This is not a thought which I
share.

00:32:37.430 --> 00:32:42.549
It is a system which undermines
traditional society in all its

00:32:42.549 --> 00:32:46.243
forms, and undermines
traditional skill sets,

00:32:46.243 --> 00:32:49.769
and that's a perfectly true
statement.

00:32:49.769 --> 00:32:53.529
When it happens it is very
coercive.

00:32:53.529 --> 00:32:57.588
It is indeed a trademark of the
way capitalism works.

00:32:57.588 --> 00:33:02.969
That a skill set which was
competitive and au

00:33:02.969 --> 00:33:09.493
courant in 1980 may not
command as much as the minimum

00:33:09.493 --> 00:33:11.440
wage in 2009.
 

00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:20.404
This is the kicker for Marx;
it is the claim that capitalism

00:33:20.404 --> 00:33:23.588
inevitably will destroy itself.
 

00:33:23.588 --> 00:33:26.739
It will undermine its own
foundations and ultimately

00:33:26.739 --> 00:33:27.480
disappear.
 

00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:31.470
We'll evaluate that view.
 

00:33:31.470 --> 00:33:38.681
This slide has cut off the main
part of the--of what's here so

00:33:38.681 --> 00:33:42.818
I'll have to remember it for
you.

00:33:42.818 --> 00:33:47.808
Capitalism is the name given to
an economic system by its

00:33:47.808 --> 00:33:51.490
enemies;
point one by its enemies.

00:33:51.490 --> 00:33:58.877
Point two a system which relies
heavily on the private use of

00:33:58.877 --> 00:34:02.945
capital;
heavily on the private use of

00:34:02.945 --> 00:34:09.108
capital combined with the profit
motive founded on self interest

00:34:09.108 --> 00:34:11.260
or family interest.
 

00:34:11.260 --> 00:34:18.824
There are hundreds of
variations on the capitalist

00:34:18.824 --> 00:34:24.291
system,
but the essentials are private

00:34:24.291 --> 00:34:30.735
deployment of capital,
open acknowledgement of profit

00:34:30.735 --> 00:34:35.329
as a motive,
and a sympathetic understanding

00:34:35.329 --> 00:34:38.380
of self or household interest.
 

00:34:38.380 --> 00:34:45.641
Another frequent part of the
package is a tolerance for

00:34:45.641 --> 00:34:47.389
innovation.
 

00:34:47.389 --> 00:34:53.590
One of the characteristic facts
about historical society is a

00:34:53.590 --> 00:34:56.380
resistance to innovation.
 

00:34:56.380 --> 00:35:00.219
And the temptation to resist
change is always there.

00:35:00.219 --> 00:35:06.010
It is absolutely always there
and as people grow older they

00:35:06.010 --> 00:35:12.103
grow more set in their ways and
expectations and less tolerant

00:35:12.103 --> 00:35:14.500
of fresh innovation.
 

00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:18.170
This course.
 

00:35:18.170 --> 00:35:22.425
We're going to start with some
excerpts from the Wealth Of

00:35:22.425 --> 00:35:23.420
Nations.
 

00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:28.260
It is available on Class V2
posted under resources.

00:35:28.260 --> 00:35:33.601
How many of you have read at
least a chapter of Wealth of

00:35:33.601 --> 00:35:34.869
Nations?
 

00:35:34.869 --> 00:35:37.989
Okay, the rest of you are in
for a treat.

00:35:37.989 --> 00:35:42.369
Smith is not only a great
writer but a great thinker.

00:35:42.369 --> 00:35:47.351
He is a much more complex
thinker than we usually imagine

00:35:47.351 --> 00:35:48.420
him to be.
 

00:35:48.420 --> 00:35:55.916
He was not a believer that it's
just fine for the poor to starve

00:35:55.916 --> 00:35:57.940
in the streets.
 

00:35:57.940 --> 00:36:00.972
He actually had very
complicated news about that

00:36:00.972 --> 00:36:04.909
which are broadly analogous to
the philosopher John Rawls,

00:36:04.909 --> 00:36:10.063
and Rawls' difference principle
about what inequalities are

00:36:10.063 --> 00:36:11.992
justified,
namely those which

00:36:11.992 --> 00:36:13.110
&gt;
 

00:36:13.110 --> 00:36:18.182
ultimately in some way to the
benefit of the least favored

00:36:18.182 --> 00:36:20.320
stratum in an economy.
 

00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:24.746
The Manifesto,
already mentioned,

00:36:24.746 --> 00:36:31.250
and in both cases we'll leave
out a good bit.

00:36:31.250 --> 00:36:33.518
Smith is a very old book.
 

00:36:33.518 --> 00:36:36.539
I recommend to you the Bantam
paperback,

00:36:36.539 --> 00:36:43.592
$7.95 of Smith because it has
wonderful little summaries of

00:36:43.592 --> 00:36:50.280
each paragraph in italics which
allow speed reading,

00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:55.148
which is actually a very useful
thing when a book would take a

00:36:55.148 --> 00:36:58.659
week to plow through in a
careful reading.

00:36:58.659 --> 00:37:02.047
We'll focus on just three or
four points there,

00:37:02.047 --> 00:37:05.878
three or four arguments in
Smith, but they are really

00:37:05.878 --> 00:37:08.530
powerful and important readings.
 

00:37:08.530 --> 00:37:12.349
The Constitution of
Liberty is by F.A.

00:37:12.349 --> 00:37:15.820
Hayek and we'll just read two
chapters that will be in a

00:37:15.820 --> 00:37:17.650
packet, which you will get.
 

00:37:17.650 --> 00:37:25.246
Hayek is the arch-conservative,
a market conservative from whom

00:37:25.246 --> 00:37:29.780
most of the conservative
movement--

00:37:29.780 --> 00:37:32.000
not not concerned with social
authority--

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:37.971
but the libertarian side of
American conservatism relies

00:37:37.971 --> 00:37:41.329
primarily on Hayek,
actually.

00:37:41.329 --> 00:37:47.835
Farewell to Alms,
this book, by a guy named

00:37:47.835 --> 00:37:52.481
Gregory Clarke,
is a book which says

00:37:52.481 --> 00:37:57.969
capitalism: more and better;
pour it on.

00:37:57.969 --> 00:38:03.010
As capitalism increases its
reach the world will grow

00:38:03.010 --> 00:38:05.239
wealthier and better.
 

00:38:05.239 --> 00:38:09.590
It is a polemical work,
written by an economist,

00:38:09.590 --> 00:38:13.416
and you will find things to
argue with even if you more or

00:38:13.416 --> 00:38:17.309
less agree with him you will
find many things to argue with

00:38:17.309 --> 00:38:21.539
him about and that will be an
important book in the course.

00:38:21.539 --> 00:38:27.333
The Mystery of Capital
by Hernando DeSoto is an

00:38:27.333 --> 00:38:33.784
argument about why the less
developed countries in the world

00:38:33.784 --> 00:38:38.744
are less developed,
and the gist of it is that

00:38:38.744 --> 00:38:44.043
formal and enforceable property
rights are a precondition to

00:38:44.043 --> 00:38:46.110
capital development.
 

00:38:46.110 --> 00:38:51.940
It's a very powerful piece of
work.

00:38:51.940 --> 00:38:55.742
Richard Posner,
The Failure of

00:38:55.742 --> 00:39:01.208
Capitalism,
Posner--anybody know who Posner

00:39:01.208 --> 00:39:02.039
is?
 

00:39:02.039 --> 00:39:05.840
Tell us loud and clear.
 

00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:07.090
Student:  A judge.
 

00:39:07.090 --> 00:39:10.059
Prof: He's a judge and
he's a judge of what persuasion,

00:39:10.059 --> 00:39:10.840
would you say?
 

00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:15.476
He's a very conservative judge,
teaches at The University of

00:39:15.476 --> 00:39:18.934
Chicago Law School,
and he has written a very

00:39:18.934 --> 00:39:22.630
penetrating analysis of the
current crisis.

00:39:22.630 --> 00:39:27.480
It is--I read maybe 20 books
and picked one on this subject,

00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:34.070
and this is the clearest and
most honest,

00:39:34.070 --> 00:39:37.092
I think, and he doesn't--he
does no ideological distortion

00:39:37.092 --> 00:39:38.420
here that I can detect.
 

00:39:38.420 --> 00:39:44.090
It is just a penetrating and
straightforward analysis of what

00:39:44.090 --> 00:39:48.250
happened, and for that reason
very useful.

00:39:48.250 --> 00:39:52.889
The Bottom Billion by
Paul Collier,

00:39:52.889 --> 00:39:57.110
who is a World Bank economist
who teaches at Oxford,

00:39:57.110 --> 00:40:02.807
and in this maps out a
diagnosis and a strategy for

00:40:02.807 --> 00:40:09.532
using market mechanisms and
capital development to alleviate

00:40:09.532 --> 00:40:13.179
most of the world's poverty.
 

00:40:13.179 --> 00:40:18.483
Finally, The White
Tiger, this is fiction,

00:40:18.483 --> 00:40:24.561
but there are times when
fiction is better at describing

00:40:24.561 --> 00:40:28.429
the real world than nonfiction.
 

00:40:28.429 --> 00:40:35.775
This is a brutally penetrating
novel written from the point of

00:40:35.775 --> 00:40:41.554
view of a very poor,
very smart, and in many ways

00:40:41.554 --> 00:40:45.889
flawed young man in South India.
 

00:40:45.889 --> 00:40:50.530
It won the Man Booker prize
last year for fiction.

00:40:50.530 --> 00:40:56.617
It is, for our age,
it is as good as Dickens and

00:40:56.617 --> 00:41:01.670
Zola were for the nineteenth
century.

00:41:01.670 --> 00:41:03.820
It's just a brilliant book.
 

00:41:03.820 --> 00:41:04.780
I couldn't put it down.
 

00:41:04.780 --> 00:41:09.288
Ten people told me I had to
read it, and I kept shrugging my

00:41:09.288 --> 00:41:13.719
shoulders and that's when I
started, and I read it front to

00:41:13.719 --> 00:41:15.630
back in one long day.
 

00:41:15.630 --> 00:41:20.201
It is--if you want to
understand why there are a

00:41:20.201 --> 00:41:25.842
billion or two billion people
out there for whom capitalism

00:41:25.842 --> 00:41:31.385
looks not like a powerful
mechanism of production but like

00:41:31.385 --> 00:41:34.789
an extremely coercive system.
 

00:41:34.789 --> 00:41:41.219
The White Tiger is a
great way to do that.

00:41:41.219 --> 00:41:44.842
Chris Buckley's,
Thank You For Smoking,

00:41:44.842 --> 00:41:45.969
is optional.
 

00:41:45.969 --> 00:41:50.231
We will also use the case
method and the case method

00:41:50.231 --> 00:41:53.489
occupies about a third of the
course.

00:41:53.489 --> 00:41:59.487
We will use--the ones in white
are straightforward cases,

00:41:59.487 --> 00:42:05.913
the ones in gold we'll have the
people in the room or some of

00:42:05.913 --> 00:42:07.518
the people.
 

00:42:07.518 --> 00:42:14.067
Polaroid is the story of the
land camera and a brilliant

00:42:14.067 --> 00:42:20.018
technology which ultimately
crashed and burned,

00:42:20.018 --> 00:42:24.717
and it's--the case is a hard
business school case about the

00:42:24.717 --> 00:42:29.416
attempt to get that business
through its crisis at the time

00:42:29.416 --> 00:42:31.280
that it went broke.
 

00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:37.268
Goldman Sachs IPO
terrifically--it's a good HBS

00:42:37.268 --> 00:42:41.036
case,
and better yet we'll have Paolo

00:42:41.036 --> 00:42:45.876
Zannoni with us to tell the
story from the inside of the

00:42:45.876 --> 00:42:47.460
Goldman system.
 

00:42:47.460 --> 00:42:53.925
Wanda Rapaczynski is the story
of getting a business going in

00:42:53.925 --> 00:42:58.559
Poland just after the death of
communism.

00:42:58.559 --> 00:43:04.934
A Yale-trained business woman
who created something called

00:43:04.934 --> 00:43:08.376
Agora S.A.,
which is the largest publishing

00:43:08.376 --> 00:43:13.253
company in East Europe,
and how she coped with the

00:43:13.253 --> 00:43:18.003
toxic environment,
the toxic business environment,

00:43:18.003 --> 00:43:19.679
left over by communism.
 

00:43:19.679 --> 00:43:25.010
Selco India is a microfinance
story.

00:43:25.010 --> 00:43:31.197
Cardiothoracic Systems is a
tech story and I'm going to have

00:43:31.197 --> 00:43:37.699
the Dean of SOM come and do it
as a business case with you,

00:43:37.699 --> 00:43:40.139
which means you're going to
need to wear helmets.

00:43:40.139 --> 00:43:43.018
She is an aggressive cold
caller.

00:43:43.018 --> 00:43:48.121
By the way, I'm going to make
two kinds of calls in this

00:43:48.121 --> 00:43:50.590
course,
cold calls are the kind of

00:43:50.590 --> 00:43:53.260
thing I did today where you get
no warning,

00:43:53.260 --> 00:43:59.289
and warm calls I'll send you an
email and say heads up about,

00:43:59.289 --> 00:44:05.217
and in the second case you've
really got to have something to

00:44:05.217 --> 00:44:05.809
say.
 

00:44:05.809 --> 00:44:12.545
Some of the fun in this stuff
is the back and forth between

00:44:12.545 --> 00:44:16.030
you and me, and you and you.
 

00:44:16.030 --> 00:44:21.329
The Enron case,
Jim Alexander is an important

00:44:21.329 --> 00:44:23.860
guy in this course.
 

00:44:23.860 --> 00:44:25.889
Jim would you just stand up and
wave?

00:44:25.889 --> 00:44:32.143
Jim was--Jim is a good friend
of mine who had a career in

00:44:32.143 --> 00:44:36.610
investment banking and then at
Enron,

00:44:36.610 --> 00:44:41.139
and he was Chief Financial
Officer of Enron,

00:44:41.139 --> 00:44:45.391
Global Pipeline &amp; Power,
and he saw what was happening

00:44:45.391 --> 00:44:46.809
and got out.
 

00:44:46.809 --> 00:44:52.958
He is referred to as the fly in
the ointment in Smartest Guys

00:44:52.958 --> 00:44:57.449
in the Room,
which is the popularized story

00:44:57.449 --> 00:44:59.500
of Enron's crash.
 

00:44:59.500 --> 00:45:04.177
He then went on and co-founded
Spinnaker Exploration whose

00:45:04.177 --> 00:45:08.527
operating principle was:
think what Enron would do and

00:45:08.527 --> 00:45:10.170
do the opposite.
 

00:45:10.170 --> 00:45:17.597
Spinnaker became a public
company and was extremely

00:45:17.597 --> 00:45:19.530
successful.
 

00:45:19.530 --> 00:45:22.704
Medley Global Advisors,
this is a case about gathering

00:45:22.704 --> 00:45:25.940
business intelligence and
selling it at high prices.

00:45:25.940 --> 00:45:30.429
Medley is another Yale-trained
person.

00:45:30.429 --> 00:45:34.927
He founded the company and the
case is about his attempt to

00:45:34.927 --> 00:45:37.911
sell the company,
which he did,

00:45:37.911 --> 00:45:41.550
so he's selling a company
that--

00:45:41.550 --> 00:45:47.088
which is posthumously his,
and he actually sold it for

00:45:47.088 --> 00:45:52.643
fifty seven million bucks,
and it's a no venture medley

00:45:52.643 --> 00:45:56.159
story and he's a very
interesting guy.

00:45:56.159 --> 00:46:00.280
Then maybe we'll talk about
Mory's.

00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:04.559
I'm chair of a workout
committee which is trying to put

00:46:04.559 --> 00:46:08.838
more effective business and it
turns out to be a really

00:46:08.838 --> 00:46:10.900
interesting hard case.
 

00:46:10.900 --> 00:46:16.000

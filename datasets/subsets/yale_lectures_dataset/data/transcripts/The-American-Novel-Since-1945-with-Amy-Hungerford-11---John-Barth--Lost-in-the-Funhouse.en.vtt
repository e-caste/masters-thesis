00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:04.463
Professor Amy
Hungerford: Let me ask you a

00:00:04.463 --> 00:00:07.593
question first about John Barth
and the stories that I asked you

00:00:07.593 --> 00:00:10.000
to read.
Which of them was your favorite?

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:18.540
Some cackling I hear.
None of them?

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:19.981
Which of them was your
favorite?Student:

00:00:19.981 --> 00:00:21.954
"Night-Sea Journey."
Professor Amy Hungerford:

00:00:21.954 --> 00:00:22.988
"Night-Sea
Journey."

00:00:22.988 --> 00:00:24.461
Why?Student:
I thought it was the

00:00:24.461 --> 00:00:26.027
profoundest joke I'd ever
read.Professor Amy

00:00:26.027 --> 00:00:31.310
Hungerford: Ah ha.
Yes. Okay. Very good. Yes.

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.070
'The profoundest joke she has
ever heard."

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.490
Who else?
Your favorite story.

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:37.473
Yes.Student:
"Lost in the

00:00:37.473 --> 00:00:38.990
Funhouse."Professor Amy
Hungerford: Okay.

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:41.847
Why is that?Student:
I really liked the tricks

00:00:41.847 --> 00:00:44.552
that Barth played with
vocabulary.Professor Amy

00:00:44.552 --> 00:00:46.598
Hungerford: Uh huh.
Yes.

00:00:46.598 --> 00:00:49.105
Okay.
What else?

00:00:49.105 --> 00:00:54.565
Other favorites?
Did anyone have "Ambrose His

00:00:54.565 --> 00:00:57.770
Mark" as a favorite?
Only one--two of you.

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:05.510
That's extremely surprising.
Why was "Ambrose His Mark" not

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.630
your favorite?
What did you not like about it?

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.843
Anyone?
Yes.Student:

00:01:14.843 --> 00:01:17.758
I actually thought it was
hard to understand,

00:01:17.758 --> 00:01:21.220
just what was happening,
the action part of the story.

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.689
It might have been that I read
it too quickly.

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:26.330
Professor Amy
Hungerford: Uh huh.

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.137
Harder than "Menelaiad"
to

00:01:28.137 --> 00:01:31.129
understand?Student:
No.Professor Amy

00:01:31.129 --> 00:01:32.372
Hungerford: No.
Oh.

00:01:32.372 --> 00:01:34.179
Okay.
Anyone else on "Ambrose His

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:37.580
Mark"?
Comments?

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.552
When I ask this question,
typically, especially when I've

00:01:41.552 --> 00:01:45.455
had students read the whole
thing, "Ambrose His Mark" is

00:01:45.455 --> 00:01:48.080
almost always the favorite
story.

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.920
And the reason for that,
I think, is that it is a

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:59.010
technically perfect short story.
It has wit;

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:04.219
it has developed characters;
it has a coherent narrative.

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:06.627
Even if it has some
difficulties,

00:02:06.627 --> 00:02:10.389
that's probably more due to
things like dialect.

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:13.694
There's a German immigrant
dialect that some of the

00:02:13.694 --> 00:02:18.258
characters speak.
It's full of little tropes,

00:02:18.258 --> 00:02:22.547
little consistencies,
little images,

00:02:22.547 --> 00:02:29.409
the bees, even the word play,
"skep" and "skeptical."

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:35.014
There are words that mirror
some of the major themes of that

00:02:35.014 --> 00:02:39.875
story about naming.
Barth, by offering us a perfect

00:02:39.875 --> 00:02:44.219
short story in that story,
is demonstrating what

00:02:44.219 --> 00:02:49.210
traditional structures of
narrative have always offered

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:51.825
us.
And the fact that it's not your

00:02:51.825 --> 00:02:54.910
favoriteâ€¦maybe we're at a
watershed moment,

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:00.987
that even traditional narrative
can justâ€¦you guys are so

00:03:00.987 --> 00:03:05.081
well beyond that seduction.
Maybe it's Lolita that

00:03:05.081 --> 00:03:07.101
we read.
Maybe it's that you got so

00:03:07.101 --> 00:03:10.804
seduced by Lolita,
or you were so well trained

00:03:10.804 --> 00:03:13.439
to be skeptical of narrative
seduction,

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:15.980
that now nothing can faze you,
nothing can seduce you.

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.479
Maybe that's it.
Give yourself that credit.

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:25.060
John Barth is a teacher,
through and through.

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.447
He actually taught at my alma
mater, Johns Hopkins,

00:03:28.447 --> 00:03:31.699
for over thirty years,
in the writing program.

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:36.609
And I once got from him a
handout that he would give to

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:41.481
his fiction classes,
and it had on it all the

00:03:41.481 --> 00:03:47.582
traditional tricks and
structures of the short story

00:03:47.582 --> 00:03:50.145
form.
It was three or four pages

00:03:50.145 --> 00:03:52.182
single-spaced,
typed: things like,

00:03:52.182 --> 00:03:55.270
"if there are five pistols
hanging on the wall,

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:59.409
by the end of the story,
they all have to go off," these

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:03.925
totally structural observations
about how to write a piece of

00:04:03.925 --> 00:04:06.547
short fiction.
It's so appropriate:

00:04:06.547 --> 00:04:10.222
in my various moves in my life,
I lost this piece of paper,

00:04:10.222 --> 00:04:12.819
and I have never been able to
find it.

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:15.321
And I've tried to be in touch
with him about it,

00:04:15.321 --> 00:04:17.449
and I couldn't get it from him
either.

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:21.292
So, this is one of the sad
things about teaching Barth for

00:04:21.292 --> 00:04:23.480
me.
He was such a teacher.

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:28.585
I think this story collection
is very much a teaching of us

00:04:28.585 --> 00:04:31.871
about narrative.
I'm sorry that I can't now

00:04:31.871 --> 00:04:33.769
produce that,
as your teacher,

00:04:33.769 --> 00:04:34.490
for you.

00:04:38.519 --> 00:04:46.970
I want to do something that
might seem odd as I begin.

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:05.225
Does this shock anyone?
Do you have a visceral sense,

00:05:05.225 --> 00:05:08.475
"oh, don't do that"?
If you do, you were probably

00:05:08.475 --> 00:05:10.970
taught, like me:
"never, never damage a book."

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:13.771
Getting in trouble:
in our house if you damaged a

00:05:13.771 --> 00:05:15.864
book you were in big trouble.
Okay.

00:05:15.864 --> 00:05:18.651
So, what I'm doing is,
I'm taking the mobius strip

00:05:18.651 --> 00:05:21.381
from the beginning,
and I am matching the letters

00:05:21.381 --> 00:05:25.867
here,
capital A--let's see how does

00:05:25.867 --> 00:05:34.243
it go--capital A overlaps with
small A, capital B overlaps with

00:05:34.243 --> 00:05:37.319
small B,
tape it together.

00:05:37.319 --> 00:05:38.774
Okay.
There we go.

00:05:38.774 --> 00:05:43.649
"Once upon a time there was a
story that began once upon a

00:05:43.649 --> 00:05:48.440
time there was a story that
began once upon a time."

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:50.029
Okay.
So, you get the point.

00:05:50.029 --> 00:05:55.290
Why does Barth put this in the
front of his story?

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:58.641
Well, I think there are
several reasons,

00:05:58.641 --> 00:06:02.069
and I'm going to name about
three of them.

00:06:02.069 --> 00:06:07.050
One is that language is
material.

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:10.753
I think we have a visceral
response, sometimes,

00:06:10.753 --> 00:06:14.699
when you cut a book,
because somehow we don't want

00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:19.449
to be reminded that a story is
in a material container.

00:06:19.449 --> 00:06:23.579
But he invites us to do this to
his story.

00:06:23.579 --> 00:06:27.410
So, that's the first point:
It's material.

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:32.423
The second point is that
narrative has a form,

00:06:32.423 --> 00:06:36.880
and that it can be constructed,
built.

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:40.160
It's like a craft.
I had my little tape and my

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.829
little scissors,
my little project,

00:06:42.829 --> 00:06:48.300
my craft project.
So, stories are a craft.

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:52.780
They get built of the material
of language.

00:06:56.019 --> 00:07:04.449
Last point: form is both
endless and closed.

00:07:04.449 --> 00:07:11.076
It is both repetitious and
endlessly filled with

00:07:11.076 --> 00:07:15.350
possibility.
Because, when you read this in

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:19.185
its mobius strip form,
you're repeating a beginning

00:07:19.185 --> 00:07:24.839
over and over and over again,
it gives you that feeling of

00:07:24.839 --> 00:07:28.839
possibility, but it's also
boring.

00:07:28.839 --> 00:07:31.290
This is not an interesting
story.

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:36.537
It doesn't tell us anything.
John Barth runs a certain

00:07:36.537 --> 00:07:40.293
kind of risk in this story
collection, and it's the risk of

00:07:40.293 --> 00:07:43.133
difficulty.
If I had had you read the whole

00:07:43.133 --> 00:07:47.000
thing, you would see even more
the kind of risk he's running.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.916
Some of the stories are
self-consciously,

00:07:51.916 --> 00:07:57.278
boringly metafictional.
They sound like all those

00:07:57.278 --> 00:08:01.948
stories we have about somebody
writing a story about

00:08:01.948 --> 00:08:04.903
themselves,
about themselves writing a

00:08:04.903 --> 00:08:08.700
story who is also writing a
story about themselves writing a

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:10.850
story.
It's very boring.

00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:16.610
There's no kind of life in it.
It's all about that endless

00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:20.820
regress.
So, Barth is taking a risk that

00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:26.512
this little craft project
emphasizes and that the stories

00:08:26.512 --> 00:08:31.210
in the book act out.
Why is it worth it to him to

00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:34.737
take that risk?
What's he trying to teach us

00:08:34.737 --> 00:08:38.859
about narrative and about
language that makes it worth

00:08:38.859 --> 00:08:41.720
this risk?
Now, let me just make the

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:45.548
last point I want to make about
this, and that's that because

00:08:45.548 --> 00:08:48.018
language is material,
it has form,

00:08:48.018 --> 00:08:52.554
it has both closedness and
possibility, it's susceptible to

00:08:52.554 --> 00:08:58.799
the workings of craft,
it's also unpredictable.

00:08:58.799 --> 00:09:00.050
What's going to happen to that
now?

00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:03.610
Who's going to find it?
It's going to sit there.

00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:06.429
It's going to blow from place
to place.

00:09:06.429 --> 00:09:10.246
Again, in other stories that I
didn't have you read,

00:09:10.246 --> 00:09:14.661
the theme of the message in the
bottle returns over and over

00:09:14.661 --> 00:09:17.582
again.
The sense that language is

00:09:17.582 --> 00:09:22.594
material means that it can be
separate from people and have a

00:09:22.594 --> 00:09:27.091
kind of life of its own.
Now, one question for us is:

00:09:27.091 --> 00:09:31.495
is the life of its own that
Barth dreams of for language

00:09:31.495 --> 00:09:36.459
similar to that life of its own
that Nabokov dreamed of for his

00:09:36.459 --> 00:09:39.482
language?
So, that's a question I want

00:09:39.482 --> 00:09:43.058
you to keep in your mind.
Is this the same dream,

00:09:43.058 --> 00:09:46.141
or is it somehow different?
So, I'm going to leave that

00:09:46.141 --> 00:09:47.835
there.
And maybe some--I don't

00:09:47.835 --> 00:09:50.830
know--some chemistry class will
show up in here,

00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:53.379
and someone will wonder what
that is,

00:09:53.379 --> 00:09:58.787
and Barth will have done his
work, or we will have done

00:09:58.787 --> 00:10:03.198
Barth's work for him.
Now, let me ask you another

00:10:03.198 --> 00:10:05.486
question.
Who is the narrator of

00:10:05.486 --> 00:10:08.364
"Night-Sea Journey"?
Student:

00:10:08.364 --> 00:10:11.309
A sperm?Professor
Amy Hungerford:

00:10:11.309 --> 00:10:13.150
Yes.
A sperm.

00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:16.070
Did everyone get that?
No.

00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:18.388
Okay.
The narrator of "Night-Sea

00:10:18.388 --> 00:10:22.581
Journey" is a sperm.
Now, why have a story with a

00:10:22.581 --> 00:10:26.076
sperm as a narrator?
Well, I think there are a

00:10:26.076 --> 00:10:28.518
couple of points,
a couple of reasons why Barth

00:10:28.518 --> 00:10:30.856
wants to do that,
and actually related to your

00:10:30.856 --> 00:10:33.410
initial point about why you
liked this, that it was-- how

00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:35.690
did you say that?--it was the
most--Student:

00:10:35.690 --> 00:10:37.422
Profound
joke--Professor Amy

00:10:37.422 --> 00:10:41.290
Hungerford: Profound joke.
It is a parody of all the

00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:46.612
meanings of life that philosophy
has offered up to us over the

00:10:46.612 --> 00:10:50.624
ages,
so it kind of runs through them

00:10:50.624 --> 00:10:57.038
in the voice of our narrator
sperm's pal, who is now gone and

00:10:57.038 --> 00:11:01.515
dead before him.
So, we get a kind of wisdom in

00:11:01.515 --> 00:11:04.943
a parodic form.
There are other points,

00:11:04.943 --> 00:11:10.299
however, and if you look on
page 4 we can see just a little

00:11:10.299 --> 00:11:15.348
example of one of them.
This sperm has gained quite a

00:11:15.348 --> 00:11:20.737
vocabulary, and it includes this
line: "I have seen the best

00:11:20.737 --> 00:11:24.300
swimmers of my generation go
under."

00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:27.450
Now, where is that from?
Of course it's from

00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:31.784
Howl: "I have seen the
best minds of my

00:11:31.784 --> 00:11:36.556
generationâ€¦."
The point of making a sperm who

00:11:36.556 --> 00:11:41.505
quotes not only Allen Ginsberg,
but also hosts of other prior

00:11:41.505 --> 00:11:45.726
literary texts,
is the point that the tradition

00:11:45.726 --> 00:11:51.059
precedes the individual speaker.
The individual speaker believes

00:11:51.059 --> 00:11:56.233
that he has an original voice.
He believes he's speaking in

00:11:56.233 --> 00:11:59.478
his own voice,
but, lo and behold,

00:11:59.478 --> 00:12:04.663
his words are not his own.
So, just as this is a redaction

00:12:04.663 --> 00:12:08.954
and a compression of all the
various meanings of life that

00:12:08.954 --> 00:12:11.740
Western philosophy has offered
up,

00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:16.658
it is also a demonstration of
how literary tropes,

00:12:16.658 --> 00:12:20.774
literary language,
little packaged bits of

00:12:20.774 --> 00:12:24.031
literature,
quotations, allusions,

00:12:24.031 --> 00:12:28.330
lard the language that is
available to this creature.

00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:42.253
His final reflections on page
12 suggest his ambition as a

00:12:42.253 --> 00:12:51.610
speaker, and it looks a lot like
a modernist ambition.

00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:54.635
The bottom of page 12: 
What has fetched me

00:12:54.635 --> 00:12:58.819
across this dreadful sea is a
single hope, gift of my poor

00:12:58.819 --> 00:13:02.049
dead comrade:
that You may be stronger-willed

00:13:02.049 --> 00:13:04.588
than I,
and that by sheer force of

00:13:04.588 --> 00:13:08.414
concentration I may transmit to
You, along with Your official

00:13:08.414 --> 00:13:12.400
Heritage,
a private legacy of awful

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:16.909
recollection and negative
resolve.

00:13:16.909 --> 00:13:19.599
Mad as it may be,
my dream is that some

00:13:19.599 --> 00:13:23.491
unimaginable embodiment of
myself (or myself plus Her if

00:13:23.491 --> 00:13:27.950
that's how it must be) will come
to find itself expressing,

00:13:27.950 --> 00:13:32.508
in however garbled or radical a
translation, some reflection of

00:13:32.508 --> 00:13:34.420
these reflections.

00:13:37.679 --> 00:13:41.395
It's a dream of changing the
tradition, of having that

00:13:41.395 --> 00:13:44.340
individual voice added to the
tradition,

00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:47.907
to have it become part of the
official heritage and yet at

00:13:47.907 --> 00:13:50.850
odds with it,
casting a different light back.

00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:55.913
This is precisely that
modernist dream specifically

00:13:55.913 --> 00:14:00.571
articulated by T.S.
Eliot in "Tradition and the

00:14:00.571 --> 00:14:06.343
Individual Talent" that the
contribution of the individual

00:14:06.343 --> 00:14:11.710
adds to and changes the
tradition in one swoop.

00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:17.169
Is this going to be Barth's
ambition, too?

00:14:17.169 --> 00:14:20.891
This is a question for us,
again, that I want to,

00:14:20.891 --> 00:14:24.379
kind of, keep up on the shelf
in your mind.

00:14:24.379 --> 00:14:27.962
In some way it's a parody of
that modernist effort,

00:14:27.962 --> 00:14:32.403
when it comes in the voice of a
sperm, because this whole story

00:14:32.403 --> 00:14:34.942
is a parody.
So, you have to ask that

00:14:34.942 --> 00:14:37.029
question and be somewhat
skeptical.

00:14:37.029 --> 00:14:41.884
For all that Barth looks like,
he embodies that traditional

00:14:41.884 --> 00:14:45.901
modernist ambition of
difficulty, of working with

00:14:45.901 --> 00:14:50.188
tradition and so on.
He looks like a classic late

00:14:50.188 --> 00:14:52.630
modernist, but is he,
really?

00:14:52.630 --> 00:14:53.550
This is the question.

00:14:56.669 --> 00:15:01.402
"Ambrose His Mark"
purports to be the story of

00:15:01.402 --> 00:15:06.226
the birth of that being when the
sperm from "Night-Sea

00:15:06.226 --> 00:15:10.139
Journey" is united with
the egg.

00:15:10.139 --> 00:15:15.248
So, this is Ambrose's
conception that we see the

00:15:15.248 --> 00:15:21.100
preamble to.
And in "Ambrose His Mark,"

00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:29.909
if you look on page 19,
you will see that Ambrose has,

00:15:29.909 --> 00:15:35.274
in some sense,
inherited some aspect of that

00:15:35.274 --> 00:15:40.389
sperm's remarkable linguistic
facility.

00:15:40.389 --> 00:15:42.140
He says: "All that
winterâ€¦."

00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:45.040
This is the middle of the page: 
All that winter,

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:49.016
as I grew in mother's womb,
grandfather fretted with his

00:15:49.016 --> 00:15:51.980
scheme [to get Willie Erdmann's
bees];

00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:55.684
when the spring's first bees
appeared on our pussy willows,

00:15:55.684 --> 00:15:58.686
on our alder catkins,
he was off with Hector and

00:15:58.686 --> 00:16:01.049
Konrad, saucepan and
cheesecloth.

00:16:01.049 --> 00:16:03.504
Their researches led them
through fresh-marsh,

00:16:03.504 --> 00:16:05.632
through pine-woods,
over stile and under

00:16:05.632 --> 00:16:08.360
trestle--but never a bee-tree
they discovered,

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:12.464
only swampy impasses or the
hives of some part-time

00:16:12.464 --> 00:16:16.092
apiarist.
He's narrating in great detail

00:16:16.092 --> 00:16:19.070
what happened while he was in
the womb.

00:16:19.070 --> 00:16:21.549
Where does this knowledge come
from?

00:16:21.549 --> 00:16:27.092
It's as if his knowledge of his
own conception,

00:16:27.092 --> 00:16:30.827
his own birth,
his own babyhood,

00:16:30.827 --> 00:16:37.544
is a natural knowledge.
But we must know that it had to

00:16:37.544 --> 00:16:43.019
come from someone,
from someone telling stories.

00:16:43.019 --> 00:16:50.038
The stories then become part of
Ambrose's own account of his own

00:16:50.038 --> 00:16:55.720
naming, an account of the origin
of his identity.

00:16:55.720 --> 00:17:02.820
That name, "Ambrose His Mark,"
is a reference to Moby-Dick.

00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:07.977
In Moby-Dick,
when Queequeg signs on to

00:17:07.977 --> 00:17:12.625
the Pequod, he makes a mark,
because he is illiterate,

00:17:12.625 --> 00:17:16.094
in place of writing his name,
signing his name,

00:17:16.094 --> 00:17:18.960
and in the novel it says
"Queequeg,

00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:22.722
his mark."
That's what's written

00:17:22.722 --> 00:17:29.543
underneath it on the contract.
With that mark Queequeg signs

00:17:29.543 --> 00:17:37.460
on to the whole trajectory of
Ahab's mad pursuit of the whale.

00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:39.668
We can think of that in another
way, as well,

00:17:39.668 --> 00:17:41.115
though.
With that mark,

00:17:41.115 --> 00:17:44.232
Queequeg signs on to the whole
trajectory of the

00:17:44.232 --> 00:17:49.177
nineteenth-century novel,
that whole narrative excess

00:17:49.177 --> 00:17:55.124
that Melville offers,
and that whole sense of destiny

00:17:55.124 --> 00:17:59.470
that is bound up with Ahab's
story.

00:17:59.470 --> 00:18:05.309
What does Ambrose sign up for
with his mark?

00:18:05.309 --> 00:18:09.012
Well, the first thing to notice
is that, unlike Queequeg,

00:18:09.012 --> 00:18:12.196
he does not sign that mark.
The mark, here,

00:18:12.196 --> 00:18:17.430
is what he's marked by,
not what he marks with.

00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:25.136
And so, it's as if the whole
tradition comes out and grabs

00:18:25.136 --> 00:18:28.709
him and names him.
And so, Uncle Karl's efforts to

00:18:28.709 --> 00:18:30.420
interpret the incident of the
bee and its relation to the mark

00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:31.795
on his face suggests the way
that certain kinds of

00:18:31.795 --> 00:18:33.170
tradition--that Uncle Karl has
been reading,

00:18:45.079 --> 00:18:49.574
probably in the Book of
Knowledge encyclopedia that

00:18:49.574 --> 00:18:54.068
he sells door to door (he's a
sort of scholarly guy)--that

00:18:54.068 --> 00:19:00.501
that tradition has named him.
He has no agency in this

00:19:00.501 --> 00:19:07.520
trajectory he's entering upon.
The effort to take the

00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:12.379
story of his birth and tell it
as if it were natural knowledge

00:19:12.379 --> 00:19:16.680
is the effort to fight against
that lack of agency.

00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:20.630
He takes those stories and he
makes them his own.

00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:25.340
That's an effort at gaining
control over what he cannot know

00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:30.690
about his own origin and what he
cannot choose in his own origin.

00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:40.008
I think that's also why Barth
chose to write this story in the

00:19:40.008 --> 00:19:44.601
perfect short story form.
And that form is also given to

00:19:44.601 --> 00:19:48.312
us in Lost in the
Funhouse, on page 95,

00:19:48.312 --> 00:19:51.809
when we get the diagram of
Freitag's Triangle.

00:19:51.809 --> 00:19:57.338
So, if you look at it here on
95, we're told in the course of

00:19:57.338 --> 00:20:02.130
the story about Ambrose and
Magda and the family:

00:20:02.130 --> 00:20:04.970
The action of
conventional dramatic narrative

00:20:04.970 --> 00:20:08.209
may be represented by a diagram
called Freitag's Triangle:

00:20:08.209 --> 00:20:10.019
A,
B, C--[And remember those are

00:20:10.019 --> 00:20:12.551
the letters from the mobius
strip as well]--or more

00:20:12.551 --> 00:20:14.730
accurately by a variant of that
diagram,

00:20:14.730 --> 00:20:16.586
A, B, C, D, with A,
B representing the

00:20:16.586 --> 00:20:20.410
expositionâ€¦
[and so on and so forth.]

00:20:20.410 --> 00:20:24.997
If you read on down in that
paragraph, you will see that

00:20:24.997 --> 00:20:30.085
Ambrose in his frustration--in
his effort to control the story

00:20:30.085 --> 00:20:32.919
that is always,
in this story,

00:20:32.919 --> 00:20:37.382
spinning out of control--he
wants to be able to use

00:20:37.382 --> 00:20:41.577
Freitag's Triangle to prop up
what has become an

00:20:41.577 --> 00:20:46.039
uncontrollable narrative and
give it a shape.

00:20:46.039 --> 00:20:49.929
He retellsâ€¦even
from one sentence to the next,

00:20:49.929 --> 00:20:53.295
he changes his mind.
He says, "This can't go on much

00:20:53.295 --> 00:20:54.789
longer.
It can go on forever."

00:20:54.789 --> 00:20:57.430
He died telling stories to
himself in the dark."

00:20:57.430 --> 00:20:59.429
He's dreaming about what will
happen to him in the funhouse.

00:20:59.429 --> 00:20:59.700
.
.

00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:01.301
.
years later when that vast

00:21:01.301 --> 00:21:03.725
suspected area of the funhouse
came to light,

00:21:03.725 --> 00:21:06.589
the first expedition found his
skeleton in one of its

00:21:06.589 --> 00:21:09.563
labyrinthine corridors and
mistook it for a part of the

00:21:09.563 --> 00:21:12.335
entertainment.
He died of starvation telling

00:21:12.335 --> 00:21:14.920
himself stories in the dark;
but unbeknownst,

00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:17.773
unbeknownst to him,
an assistant operator of the

00:21:17.773 --> 00:21:20.140
funhouse, happening to overhear
him,

00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:23.624
crouched just behind the
plyboard partition and wrote

00:21:23.624 --> 00:21:26.091
down every word.
The operator's daughter,

00:21:26.091 --> 00:21:29.351
an exquisite young woman with a
figure unusually well developed

00:21:29.351 --> 00:21:31.519
for her age,
crouched just behind the

00:21:31.519 --> 00:21:34.279
partition and transcribed his
every word.

00:21:34.279 --> 00:21:38.130
He changes the story from one
sentence to the next.

00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:43.309
Freitag's Triangle won't help
him at all.

00:21:43.309 --> 00:21:47.245
So, just knowing the form that
the story is supposed to take,

00:21:47.245 --> 00:21:50.460
and then knowing that language
has grabbed you,

00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:54.593
all these formulaic little
phrases, "a figure unusually

00:21:54.593 --> 00:21:58.620
well developed for her age,"
these little stock phrases.

00:22:01.690 --> 00:22:06.700
They are what he has to work
with, even though they are what

00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:11.880
defeat him in his effort to make
sense of this experience with

00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:14.558
Magda.
And it is the experience

00:22:14.558 --> 00:22:18.279
with Magda that produces the
problem in the first place.

00:22:18.279 --> 00:22:30.175
And so, if we look at page 84,
you can see the,

00:22:30.175 --> 00:22:40.519
sort of, primal scene of this
problem.

00:22:40.519 --> 00:22:47.205
This is when he and Magda were
having a sort of erotic game one

00:22:47.205 --> 00:22:52.040
summer in the shed.
They were playing slaves and

00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:57.089
masters, and he was the master,
and she was the slave.

00:22:57.089 --> 00:23:03.969
So, he's imagining their future
and talking about it with Magda

00:23:03.969 --> 00:23:06.300
when they're older.

00:23:10.309 --> 00:23:12.809
I'm going to start sort of in
the middle of the page.

00:23:12.809 --> 00:23:15.670
He would be quite famous
in his line of work.

00:23:15.670 --> 00:23:19.145
Whether Magda was his wife or
not, one evening when he was

00:23:19.145 --> 00:23:22.559
wise-lined and gray at the
temples he'd smile gravely,

00:23:22.559 --> 00:23:25.662
at a fashionable dinner party,
and remind her of his youthful

00:23:25.662 --> 00:23:27.607
passion.
The time they went with his

00:23:27.607 --> 00:23:30.164
family to Ocean City;
the erotic fantasies he

00:23:30.164 --> 00:23:33.164
used to have about her.
How long ago it seemed and

00:23:33.164 --> 00:23:35.102
childish!
Yet tender too,

00:23:35.102 --> 00:23:38.000
n'est-ce pas?
[That's a Humbert moment.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.499
That's Humbert.]
Would she have imagined that

00:23:40.499 --> 00:23:43.738
the world famous whatever
remembered how many strings were

00:23:43.738 --> 00:23:47.089
on the lyre on the bench beside
the girl on the label of the

00:23:47.089 --> 00:23:51.010
cigar box he'd stated at in the
tool shed at age ten while she,

00:23:51.010 --> 00:23:55.106
age eleven.
Even then, he had felt wise

00:23:55.106 --> 00:23:57.731
beyond his years;
[Another stock phrase.]

00:23:57.731 --> 00:24:00.835
he'd stroked her hair and said
in his deepest voice and

00:24:00.835 --> 00:24:03.837
correctest English,
as to a dear child,

00:24:03.837 --> 00:24:07.130
"I shall never forget this
moment."

00:24:07.130 --> 00:24:11.584
But though he had breathed
heavily, groaned as if ecstatic,

00:24:11.584 --> 00:24:15.654
what he'd really felt
throughout was an odd detachment

00:24:15.654 --> 00:24:18.650
as though someone else were
Master.

00:24:18.650 --> 00:24:22.620
Strive as he might to be
transported, he had heard his

00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:26.816
mind take notes upon the scene:
This is what they call

00:24:26.816 --> 00:24:30.940
passion.
I am experiencing it.

00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:34.285
Many of the digger machines
were out of order in the penny

00:24:34.285 --> 00:24:37.337
arcades and could not be
repaired or replaced for the

00:24:37.337 --> 00:24:39.064
duration.
Moreover, the prizes,

00:24:39.064 --> 00:24:40.579
made now in
U.S.Aâ€¦.

00:24:40.579 --> 00:24:43.319
It goes off in this strange
digression.

00:24:43.319 --> 00:24:46.030
It seems like his mind has
simply wandered,

00:24:46.030 --> 00:24:49.579
as it does, from one version of
the story to another.

00:24:49.579 --> 00:24:53.559
But the mention of the machines
is not incidental.

00:24:53.559 --> 00:24:56.950
Narrative becomes a kind of
machine.

00:24:56.950 --> 00:25:01.113
You put your penny in the slot
and it works to produce the

00:25:01.113 --> 00:25:04.088
narrative.
And that's that first part that

00:25:04.088 --> 00:25:07.947
I read, where he's looking back
fondly with Magda from his

00:25:07.947 --> 00:25:09.968
eminence,
later in life,

00:25:09.968 --> 00:25:14.803
and it seems safely past and
something that can be talked

00:25:14.803 --> 00:25:17.322
about.
But the problem is that,

00:25:17.322 --> 00:25:21.680
even if he could produce that
kind of comforting narrative,

00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:26.780
the problem it produced at the
level of identity will never be

00:25:26.780 --> 00:25:29.665
repaired.
Self-alienation,

00:25:29.665 --> 00:25:33.890
in Barth's work,
is the product of desire.

00:25:33.890 --> 00:25:37.026
Desire, love:
that's the moment when you're

00:25:37.026 --> 00:25:39.640
supposed to be perfectly
present.

00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:45.084
And what happens to Ambrose?
That's the moment when he is

00:25:45.084 --> 00:25:50.079
perfectly, distressingly
alienated from himself.

00:25:50.079 --> 00:25:54.765
And, it's the moment when
language comes in and is the

00:25:54.765 --> 00:25:59.804
product of that alienation,
or perhaps when language comes

00:25:59.804 --> 00:26:05.469
in and causes that alienation.
So, he can't experience an

00:26:05.469 --> 00:26:10.889
erotic moment without also
experiencing it through the

00:26:10.889 --> 00:26:16.393
screen of language,
and what he ends up doing is

00:26:16.393 --> 00:26:20.809
experiencing language instead of
sex.

00:26:20.809 --> 00:26:26.819
So, this is the problem that's
never solved in Lost in the

00:26:26.819 --> 00:26:32.930
Funhouse, and it has
all kinds of ramifications.

00:26:32.930 --> 00:26:36.339
This is on 83,
just the page before.

00:26:36.339 --> 00:26:40.748
Remember, this whole story
takes place under the aegis of

00:26:40.748 --> 00:26:46.966
his alienation from himself.
He's thinking about what he'd

00:26:46.966 --> 00:26:51.916
like to do in the funhouse.
If you knew your way

00:26:51.916 --> 00:26:54.699
around in the funhouse like your
own bedroom, you could wait

00:26:54.699 --> 00:26:57.623
until a girl came along and then
slip away without ever getting

00:26:57.623 --> 00:26:59.724
caught,
even if her boyfriend was right

00:26:59.724 --> 00:27:02.599
with her.
She'd think he did it!

00:27:02.599 --> 00:27:06.187
It would be better to be the
boyfriend, and act outraged,

00:27:06.187 --> 00:27:10.150
and tear the funhouse apart.
Not act;

00:27:10.150 --> 00:27:14.153
be.
"He's a master diver," Ambrose

00:27:14.153 --> 00:27:16.970
said.
In feigned admiration.

00:27:16.970 --> 00:27:20.640
"You really have to slave away
at it to get that good." 

00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:22.289
He's playing with Freudian
slips.

00:27:22.289 --> 00:27:25.529
Of course, what he's thinking
about all the time is the

00:27:25.529 --> 00:27:28.289
master-slave game,
and so here it comes out,

00:27:28.289 --> 00:27:31.166
when he's talking about his
brother's diving:

00:27:31.166 --> 00:27:34.268
"He's a master diver.
You really have to slave away

00:27:34.268 --> 00:27:37.467
at it."
He can't control the emergence

00:27:37.467 --> 00:27:41.052
of his desire,
his memory of the desire,

00:27:41.052 --> 00:27:46.497
back into his daily speech.
So, he can't control that

00:27:46.497 --> 00:27:50.797
Freudian slip,
and he also has to correct

00:27:50.797 --> 00:27:53.074
himself,
remind himself,

00:27:53.074 --> 00:27:57.597
that what he wants to do in the
funhouse is actually not act

00:27:57.597 --> 00:28:01.755
like the outraged boyfriend
but be the outraged

00:28:01.755 --> 00:28:04.657
boyfriend.
This is always the problem for

00:28:04.657 --> 00:28:08.380
Ambrose.
He can't just be something;

00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:12.789
he is always conscious of
inhabiting a performance.

00:28:12.789 --> 00:28:16.630
And it's usually a verbal
performance.

00:28:16.630 --> 00:28:23.755
These are the problems that
plague Menelaus so

00:28:23.755 --> 00:28:30.880
terribly in that final story
that I asked you to read.

00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:34.276
So, one of the problems with
narrative, I said earlier when

00:28:34.276 --> 00:28:37.789
we talked about the mobius
strip, is that it's repetition.

00:28:37.789 --> 00:28:41.325
This suggests a kind of
exhaustion of language and

00:28:41.325 --> 00:28:45.365
Ambrose's use of these packaged
phrases in Lost in the

00:28:45.365 --> 00:28:49.405
Funhouse suggests the
impossibility of using all that

00:28:49.405 --> 00:28:53.253
tradition,
all that stock of language,

00:28:53.253 --> 00:28:58.839
to adequately encounter what
daily life will bring you,

00:28:58.839 --> 00:29:06.019
and especially to adequately
inhabit something like desire.

00:29:06.019 --> 00:29:09.255
Barth wrote a famous essay just
the year before these stories

00:29:09.255 --> 00:29:12.245
came out all in one volume.
They had been written over a

00:29:12.245 --> 00:29:13.926
series of years,
about five years,

00:29:13.926 --> 00:29:16.003
in the '60s.
And he wrote a very famous

00:29:16.003 --> 00:29:18.580
essay--got a lot of
exposure--called "The Literature

00:29:18.580 --> 00:29:20.490
of Exhaustion."
And there,

00:29:20.490 --> 00:29:24.137
he criticized a lot of the work
that was being done,

00:29:24.137 --> 00:29:26.640
and these are the terms he
uses.

00:29:30.039 --> 00:29:33.180
He said there were two kinds of
artists: ones who are

00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:36.200
"technically up to date," and
ones that are not.

00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:40.001
Those who are not write
turn of the century-type

00:29:40.001 --> 00:29:44.623
novels, only in more or less mid
twentieth-century language and

00:29:44.623 --> 00:29:47.680
about contemporary people and
topics.

00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:51.091
This makes them less
interesting to me than excellent

00:29:51.091 --> 00:29:54.240
writers who are also technically
contemporary,

00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:56.691
Joyce and Kafka,
for instance,

00:29:56.691 --> 00:30:00.410
in their time,
and in ours Samuel Beckett and

00:30:00.410 --> 00:30:04.848
Jorge Luis Borges.
What exhausts language is

00:30:04.848 --> 00:30:10.183
the failure to keep technically
up to date, and that means in

00:30:10.183 --> 00:30:14.450
innovation in form.
"Menelaiad" is where

00:30:14.450 --> 00:30:18.216
Barth really stakes his claim
for innovation:

00:30:18.216 --> 00:30:21.896
those nested layers of
narrative that are so

00:30:21.896 --> 00:30:26.945
off-putting on the page that I
have to send you a handout to

00:30:26.945 --> 00:30:32.170
help you over the weekend.
(Otherwise I worry that people

00:30:32.170 --> 00:30:37.130
will be really lost.) It's very
off-putting, but it's precisely

00:30:37.130 --> 00:30:41.849
those nested stories that allow
him to do some of the really

00:30:41.849 --> 00:30:46.410
pleasurable things that he can
do in that story and,

00:30:46.410 --> 00:30:49.907
I would say,
get at some of the very deep

00:30:49.907 --> 00:30:54.980
questions raised by the earlier
stories that he finally,

00:30:54.980 --> 00:31:01.595
kind of, gets hold of (to use
his own words) in this last

00:31:01.595 --> 00:31:04.433
story.
So, I want to begin by

00:31:04.433 --> 00:31:07.928
thinking about Menelaus's
predicament with Helen,

00:31:07.928 --> 00:31:09.530
and this is on 146.

00:31:12.609 --> 00:31:18.188
So, he spares Helen's life in
Troy and brings her home,

00:31:18.188 --> 00:31:23.250
and this is the story that he
has been telling.

00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:33.104
So, he says,
"I decided that I would spare

00:31:33.104 --> 00:31:38.050
her life and accept her
groveling for forgiveness

00:31:38.050 --> 00:31:40.285
instead."
So, this is the story he's

00:31:40.285 --> 00:31:41.042
telling himself:.
.

00:31:41.042 --> 00:31:42.926
.
I forbore, resolved to accept

00:31:42.926 --> 00:31:46.480
in lieu of her death a modest
portion of heartfelt grovel.

00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:49.899
Further, once she'd flung
herself at my knees and kissed

00:31:49.899 --> 00:31:53.753
my hem I would order her supine
and mount more as one who loves

00:31:53.753 --> 00:31:56.413
than one who conquers;
not impossibly,

00:31:56.413 --> 00:32:00.098
should she acquit herself well
and often, I would even

00:32:00.098 --> 00:32:03.436
entertain a plea for her
eventual forgiveness and

00:32:03.436 --> 00:32:08.100
restoration to the Atrean house.
Accordingly I drew myself up to

00:32:08.100 --> 00:32:10.933
discharge her
objection--whereupon she gave

00:32:10.933 --> 00:32:15.250
over cleaning her nails and set
to drumming them on one knee.

00:32:15.250 --> 00:32:18.777
""""""Let your repentance
salt my shoe leather," I said

00:32:18.777 --> 00:32:22.317
presently, "and then,
as I lately sheathed my blade

00:32:22.317 --> 00:32:26.089
of anger, so sheath you my blade
of love." 

00:32:26.089 --> 00:32:27.920
"""""I only just came
aboard," she replied.

00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:32.733
"I haven't unpacked yet." 
 """"With a roar I went

00:32:32.733 --> 00:32:35.551
up the companionway,
dashed stern to stem,

00:32:35.551 --> 00:32:38.596
close-hauled the main,
flogged a smile from my

00:32:38.596 --> 00:32:42.000
navigator, and clove us through
the pastures of the squid.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.891
Leagues thereafter,
when the moon changed phase I

00:32:44.891 --> 00:32:47.542
overtook myself,
determined shrewdly that her

00:32:47.542 --> 00:32:50.934
Troy chests were secured,
and vowing this time to grant

00:32:50.934 --> 00:32:53.713
the trull no quarter,
at the second watch of night

00:32:53.713 --> 00:32:56.720
burst into her cubby and forgave
her straight out.

00:32:56.720 --> 00:33:00.089
"Of the unspeakable we'll speak
no further," I declared.

00:33:00.089 --> 00:33:04.009
"I here extend to you what no
other in my position would:

00:33:04.009 --> 00:33:07.202
my outright pardon."
To which, some moments after,

00:33:07.202 --> 00:33:09.481
I briskly appended:
"Disrobe and receive,

00:33:09.481 --> 00:33:12.099
it for the sake of pity!
This offer won't stand forever."

00:33:12.099 --> 00:33:15.714
[And of course there are lots
of phallic jokes here,

00:33:15.714 --> 00:33:17.912
so I hope you're getting
those.]

00:33:17.912 --> 00:33:21.357
There I had her;
she yawned and responded:

00:33:21.357 --> 00:33:23.950
"It's late.
I'm tired." 

00:33:23.950 --> 00:33:26.804
 """"Up the mast half a
dozen times I stormed and

00:33:26.804 --> 00:33:28.759
shinnied, took oar to my
navigator,

00:33:28.759 --> 00:33:31.242
lost sight of Nestor,
thundered and lightninged

00:33:31.242 --> 00:33:34.873
through Poseidon's finny fief.
When next I came to season,

00:33:34.873 --> 00:33:38.680
I stood a night slyly by while
she dusk-to-dawned it,

00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:42.174
then saluted with this
challenge her opening eyes:

00:33:42.174 --> 00:33:44.599
"Man born of woman is
imperfect.

00:33:44.599 --> 00:33:47.449
On the three thousand two
hundred eighty-seventh night of

00:33:47.449 --> 00:33:52.273
your Parisian affair,
as I lay in Simois-mud picking

00:33:52.273 --> 00:33:59.460
vermin off the wound I got that
day from cunning Pandarus,

00:33:59.460 --> 00:34:03.539
exhaustion closed my eyes.
I dreamed myself was pretty

00:34:03.539 --> 00:34:07.019
Paris, plucked by Aphrodite from
the field and dropped into

00:34:07.019 --> 00:34:09.847
Helen's naked lap.
There we committed sweet

00:34:09.847 --> 00:34:13.110
adultery;
I woke wet, wept. . ." 

00:34:13.110 --> 00:34:16.316
 """"Here I paused in my
fiction to shield my eyes and

00:34:16.316 --> 00:34:19.360
stanch the arrow-straight tracks

Then, as one who'd waited
precisely for her maledict voice

00:34:22.842 --> 00:34:26.631
to hoarsen, I outshouted her in
these terms: "Therefore come to

00:34:26.631 --> 00:34:28.698
bed,
my equal, uncursing,

00:34:28.698 --> 00:34:31.758
uncursed!" 
""""The victory was mine,

I still believe,

winded Helen shook her head,
declaring, "I have the curse."

00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:41.880
[She has her period.] 
 """"My taffrail oaths

00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:45.570
took Triton's stamp-ground;
I fed to the fish my navigator,

knocked my head against the
mast and others;

00:34:47.849 --> 00:34:51.720
hollered up a gale that blew us
from Laconic Melea to Egypt.

00:34:51.720 --> 00:34:55.056
My crew grew restive;
when the storm was spent and I

00:34:55.056 --> 00:34:57.667
had done flogging me with
halyard, I chose a moment

00:34:57.667 --> 00:34:59.599
somewhere off snakÃ¨d
Libya,

00:34:59.599 --> 00:35:02.535
slipped my cloak,
rapped at Helen's cabin,

00:35:02.535 --> 00:35:05.900
and in measured tones declared:
"Forgive me."

00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:08.860
Adding firmly:
"Are you there?"

00:35:08.860 --> 00:35:12.679
He's pathetic!
He runs through all these

00:35:12.679 --> 00:35:17.679
stories about himself,
and as each one fails to win

00:35:17.679 --> 00:35:23.780
him back into Helen's cabin,
he comes up with another one.

00:35:23.780 --> 00:35:28.190
This is a certain kind of
exhausted narrative.

00:35:28.190 --> 00:35:33.894
It's the failure of any of
these stock narratives to have

00:35:33.894 --> 00:35:40.720
the effect of restoring love and
desire, but it's more than that.

00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:44.389
It's playful.
It's funny.

00:35:44.389 --> 00:35:49.496
Barth's effort at showing us
the exhaustion of narrative

00:35:49.496 --> 00:35:53.860
produces a kind of new pleasure
in narrative.

00:35:53.860 --> 00:35:58.284
So it's by pointing it out,
and then parodying it,

00:35:58.284 --> 00:36:02.890
that he begins to renew the
resources of fiction.

00:36:08.019 --> 00:36:11.234
There are deeper and more
difficult issues at stake,

00:36:11.234 --> 00:36:15.533
though, and this is in 155.
We get a more serious version

00:36:15.533 --> 00:36:20.920
of the scene with Magda and the
problem of self-alienation.

00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:28.389
And this is what is really at
the heart of Menelaus's story.

00:36:28.389 --> 00:36:34.205
So, remember that the story is
that he is obsessed with this

00:36:34.205 --> 00:36:39.428
question of why Helen chose him
among all her suitors:

00:36:39.428 --> 00:36:44.293
why did she choose him?
And, when he asks on their

00:36:44.293 --> 00:36:47.852
wedding night,
she gives him an answer that

00:36:47.852 --> 00:36:52.090
only makes him more obsessed
with the question.

00:36:56.139 --> 00:36:59.370
So, at the top of 155,
he's asked his question.

00:36:59.370 --> 00:37:03.340
"'Speak,' he commanded.
She whispered, 'Love.'"

00:37:03.340 --> 00:37:07.020
Now, the problem with that is
that answer;

00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:13.957
it's a verb and a noun.
And Menelaus doesn't know how

00:37:13.957 --> 00:37:19.430
to take it, so here it becomes a
verb:

00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:22.829
He held her fast;
she took him willy-nilly to her;

00:37:22.829 --> 00:37:25.719
I feel her yet,
one endless instant,

00:37:25.719 --> 00:37:29.929
Menelaus was no more,
never has been since.

00:37:29.929 --> 00:37:34.279
This is like that moment of
erotic play with Magda for

00:37:34.279 --> 00:37:37.770
Ambrose.
It eradicates identity,

00:37:37.770 --> 00:37:42.040
eradicates sense of self.
It's gone forever,

00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:44.820
and you can see the change in
pronouns.

00:37:44.820 --> 00:37:46.780
"She took him willy-nilly to
her."

00:37:46.780 --> 00:37:50.300
He's telling a story about
himself, seemingly,

00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:53.820
but who is the "I," then,
that's left over?

00:37:53.820 --> 00:37:59.737
"I feel her yet."
There is some residual identity

00:37:59.737 --> 00:38:04.619
left over that can still have a
sense of embodiment.

00:38:04.619 --> 00:38:05.385
.
.

00:38:05.385 --> 00:38:07.717
.
In his red ear then she

00:38:07.717 --> 00:38:11.131
whispered, "Why'd I wed you?"
Less what than who,

00:38:11.131 --> 00:38:13.220
et cetera?"""""
"""My very

00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:15.672
question."
"""""""Speak," Menelaus

Elysium, to fade forever among
the fadeless asphodel;

00:38:44.650 --> 00:38:48.469
his curious fancy alone
remained unlaid;

00:38:48.469 --> 00:38:53.617
when he came to himself it
still asked softly:

00:38:53.617 --> 00:38:58.855
"why?""""""".
And don't I cry out to me

00:38:58.855 --> 00:39:00.502
every hour since.

00:39:00.502 --> 00:39:01.599
.
.

00:39:01.599 --> 00:39:08.380
So, that self-alienation causes
him to lose his love.

00:39:08.380 --> 00:39:13.599
We're told later that he stops
sleeping with her because he

00:39:13.599 --> 00:39:16.840
just can't get it out of his
mind.

00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:22.683
He'd rather sit and wonder.
His curious fancy is more

00:39:22.683 --> 00:39:26.583
active than his desire.
Or, you might say,

00:39:26.583 --> 00:39:30.889
his desire to know is more
active than his desire to love.

00:39:30.889 --> 00:39:35.510
But there is yet a complication
to this problem.

00:39:35.510 --> 00:39:40.150
It's not just about Menelaus
and what he chooses to do with

00:39:40.150 --> 00:39:43.482
his desire.
It's also about Helen and her

00:39:43.482 --> 00:39:49.710
action and her answer.
On 156 he reflects.

00:39:53.260 --> 00:39:55.611
Seven years of this,
more or less,

00:39:55.611 --> 00:39:58.386
not much conversation,
something wrong with the

00:39:58.386 --> 00:40:01.220
marriage.
Helen he could hold;

00:40:01.220 --> 00:40:06.570
how hold Menelaus?
To love is easy;

00:40:06.570 --> 00:40:11.750
to be loved as if one were
real, on the order of others:

00:40:11.750 --> 00:40:15.750
fearsome mystery!
Unbearable responsibility!

00:40:15.750 --> 00:40:19.178
To her Menelaus
signified something

00:40:19.178 --> 00:40:22.440
recognizable,
as Helen to him.

00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:28.203
Whatever was it?
There is that sense that the

00:40:28.203 --> 00:40:34.320
other person looking at you,
loving you, assures you somehow

00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:38.214
of your reality,
that you're real,

00:40:38.214 --> 00:40:42.289
that you're not an imaginary
being.

00:40:42.289 --> 00:40:47.162
So, it's a way of reminding you
that you're not really

00:40:47.162 --> 00:40:52.218
alienated, but this is what
Menelaus cannot get his head

00:40:52.218 --> 00:40:56.722
around.
He cannot understand that he

00:40:56.722 --> 00:41:04.704
could be loved for no reason and
Proteus sort of gives us a sense

00:41:04.704 --> 00:41:09.070
of how we could understand this.

00:41:13.860 --> 00:41:18.910
This is on 161.
Helen chose you without

00:41:18.910 --> 00:41:22.369
reason because she loves you
without cause;

00:41:22.369 --> 00:41:26.200
embrace her without question
and watch your weather change.

00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:30.800
Let go.
It's a failure of faith in

00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:35.275
Aphrodite.
So, to accept love is to accept

00:41:35.275 --> 00:41:40.516
your being and to have faith
that love affirms it,

00:41:40.516 --> 00:41:45.232
affirms that being.
Remember that self-admonition:

00:41:45.232 --> 00:41:49.090
not act like the
boyfriend but be.

00:41:49.090 --> 00:41:52.750
This is what Menelaus has to
ask forgiveness for.

00:41:52.750 --> 00:41:58.391
He didn't have enough faith in
love just to be and to accept

00:41:58.391 --> 00:42:03.362
the affirmation of his being
that Helen's reasonless,

00:42:03.362 --> 00:42:09.387
causeless love embodies.
Barth is asking a really

00:42:09.387 --> 00:42:16.083
serious question about the
compatibility between life and

00:42:16.083 --> 00:42:20.149
voice.
Remember that in "Ambrose His

00:42:20.149 --> 00:42:26.127
Mark" Ambrose is saved
from the bees lighting on his

00:42:26.127 --> 00:42:31.590
mouth because his mouth is on
his mother's breast.

00:42:31.590 --> 00:42:37.987
He's asleep there having nursed.
It's as if the bees which

00:42:37.987 --> 00:42:42.487
signify eloquence if they land
on your mouth,

00:42:42.487 --> 00:42:47.500
they land on his eyes and on
his ears instead.

00:42:47.500 --> 00:42:52.317
He can't have both that
connection with his mother and

00:42:52.317 --> 00:42:55.739
that kind of eloquence.
It's one or the other.

00:42:55.739 --> 00:42:58.517
You can't have love and
language somehow,

00:42:58.517 --> 00:43:02.405
and this is a very Freudian
understanding of how language

00:43:02.405 --> 00:43:05.278
works.
He tells a story about a child

00:43:05.278 --> 00:43:08.183
playing what's called the
"Fort-Da" game:

00:43:08.183 --> 00:43:10.710
here, away.
He has a little ball.

00:43:10.710 --> 00:43:14.059
A little two- or three-year-old
kid has a ball.

00:43:14.059 --> 00:43:16.920
He throws it away and then
retrieves it,

00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:21.468
he throws it away and retrieves
it, and Freud theorizes that he

00:43:21.468 --> 00:43:24.256
does that and he says,
"Fort, da, fort,

00:43:24.256 --> 00:43:26.569
da."
He does that because the

00:43:26.569 --> 00:43:30.518
language is a way of controlling
his mother's absence and the

00:43:30.518 --> 00:43:34.022
ball stands in for the mother.
It disappears and then it comes

00:43:34.022 --> 00:43:36.161
back.
It disappears and comes back,

00:43:36.161 --> 00:43:39.471
and at that time his mother,
who is actually Freud's

00:43:39.471 --> 00:43:42.976
daughter,
was going out to work for the

00:43:42.976 --> 00:43:48.147
first time on some days,
and the boy was getting used to

00:43:48.147 --> 00:43:52.008
letting her go.
So, language arises from

00:43:52.008 --> 00:43:55.333
that loss.
And Ambrose is only named once

00:43:55.333 --> 00:44:00.443
he's separated from his mother
and no longer nurses as a result

00:44:00.443 --> 00:44:05.457
of the bee incident,
and he also only gains a male

00:44:05.457 --> 00:44:09.725
name at that time.
And so, I think it's important

00:44:09.725 --> 00:44:14.473
that the masculinity of language
asserted with a talking sperm at

00:44:14.473 --> 00:44:18.553
the very beginning of this
collection is consistent with

00:44:18.553 --> 00:44:23.449
this sense that you become male
when you enter into language.

00:44:23.449 --> 00:44:27.329
Somehow when you're unnamed
you're not part of language;

00:44:27.329 --> 00:44:29.139
you're still connected to the
mother.

00:44:29.139 --> 00:44:30.420
And he actually had a female
name.

00:44:30.420 --> 00:44:33.730
Remember he's called Christine
for a while.

00:44:33.730 --> 00:44:40.719
So he becomes a boy after he's
separated from his mother.

00:44:40.719 --> 00:44:46.322
Menelaus's problem with Helen
suggests that incompatibility of

00:44:46.322 --> 00:44:51.246
being connected to the other,
and here across the line of

00:44:51.246 --> 00:44:55.860
gender, connected with the other
and somehow being able to be

00:44:55.860 --> 00:45:01.760
assimilated into language,
and the silence of the oracle

00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:05.429
on the question,
"Who am I?"

00:45:05.429 --> 00:45:08.133
This is on 158,
and you just get that blank,

00:45:08.133 --> 00:45:11.781
silence, and you can see it
enclosed in all those quotation

00:45:11.781 --> 00:45:14.830
marks.
This is Barth's effort to

00:45:14.830 --> 00:45:18.420
enclose the silence into
something readable,

00:45:18.420 --> 00:45:23.679
to contain that impossibility
in the structure of the story.

00:45:23.679 --> 00:45:27.739
So all the quotation marks
suggest human voice.

00:45:27.739 --> 00:45:33.143
I want to suggest to you
finally that Barth is interested

00:45:33.143 --> 00:45:39.320
in the oral tradition above all
other traditions in this book.

00:45:39.320 --> 00:45:43.772
He's using Greek epic as the
source of his literary canon,

00:45:43.772 --> 00:45:47.674
here, and his canon of stories,
of narratives,

00:45:47.674 --> 00:45:53.162
because it's oral tradition
that brings the human voice and

00:45:53.162 --> 00:45:56.334
the human being,
the fact of a person,

00:45:56.334 --> 00:46:00.037
together most closely.
That's what fascinates him

00:46:00.037 --> 00:46:04.093
about the spoken word,
as opposed to the word you

00:46:04.093 --> 00:46:07.217
read.
And in other stories in this

00:46:07.217 --> 00:46:12.550
collection Barth experimented
with recording them with tape.

00:46:12.550 --> 00:46:15.168
So, these are stories,
some of them for voice and

00:46:15.168 --> 00:46:18.387
tape, and he'd do readings where
he'd go and he'd put a tape

00:46:18.387 --> 00:46:21.770
recorder on the podium and he'd
stand next to the tape recorder

00:46:21.770 --> 00:46:24.880
as his voice read the story from
the tape recorder.

00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:29.976
And it was all to dramatize the
problematic relationship between

00:46:29.976 --> 00:46:34.309
voice, story and person.
But I think the dream of

00:46:34.309 --> 00:46:38.371
Menelaus is that somehow that
voice can be residual,

00:46:38.371 --> 00:46:42.492
that somehow it can survive.
And, in that sense,

00:46:42.492 --> 00:46:47.626
I think it has something in
common with Nabokov's fantasy of

00:46:47.626 --> 00:46:52.855
the living artwork.
But, unlike Nabokov's fantasy,

00:46:52.855 --> 00:46:59.377
it requires this concept of
love, because love is what makes

00:46:59.377 --> 00:47:03.857
being into narrative.
It takes two,

00:47:03.857 --> 00:47:09.460
and it takes desire.
Desire moves narrative.

00:47:09.460 --> 00:47:13.009
And so at the end,
the comic ending of

00:47:13.009 --> 00:47:18.861
"Menelaiad," which echoes
the comic ending of Odysseus'

00:47:18.861 --> 00:47:22.027
trip back home,
of The Odyssey,

00:47:22.027 --> 00:47:25.660
he says:
Menelaus's story itself

00:47:25.660 --> 00:47:29.156
in ten or ten thousand years
expires, yet I'll survive it

00:47:29.156 --> 00:47:33.434
[Who is this "I"?],
I, in Proteus's terrifying last

00:47:33.434 --> 00:47:37.088
disguise, Beauty" spouse"s,
odd Elysium:

00:47:37.088 --> 00:47:42.375
the absurd,
unending possibility of

00:47:42.375 --> 00:47:47.759
love.
If you think that Barth in all

00:47:47.759 --> 00:47:52.943
his heady, intellectual,
canonical difficulty is

00:47:52.943 --> 00:47:58.679
uninterested in the world
outside of his fiction,

00:47:58.679 --> 00:48:03.993
I think you could argue that
it's on this notion of desire

00:48:03.993 --> 00:48:08.840
that he stakes his work's
connection to the world.

00:48:08.840 --> 00:48:12.104
And the echo of that desire is,
I would say,

00:48:12.104 --> 00:48:14.989
pleasure: something like,
in this case,

00:48:14.989 --> 00:48:19.164
Nabokov's aesthetic bliss,
but here it's more funny than

00:48:19.164 --> 00:48:20.000
that.

00:48:23.010 --> 00:48:27.376
It's not even so much the
transportation and the nostalgic

00:48:27.376 --> 00:48:30.900
quality of Nabokov's
description, sometimes.

00:48:30.900 --> 00:48:33.226
It's that wit,
that pleasurable wit,

00:48:33.226 --> 00:48:36.883
the pleasure we get reading,
being absorbed by something

00:48:36.883 --> 00:48:39.409
that we have to work hard to
read,

00:48:39.409 --> 00:48:42.560
and yet repays us with that
pleasure.

00:48:45.699 --> 00:48:49.884
When you read Crying of Lot
49 I'd like you to think

00:48:49.884 --> 00:48:54.501
about what that novel represents
in the relation between language

00:48:54.501 --> 00:48:56.960
and the world.
Is it similar?

00:48:56.960 --> 00:49:00.872
Barth and Pynchon are often
talked about as part of the same

00:49:00.872 --> 00:49:04.056
metafictional movement in this
couple of decades,

00:49:04.056 --> 00:49:06.790
'60s and '70s.
Are they assimilable to one

00:49:06.790 --> 00:49:10.000
another in these terms?
Think about that as you read.

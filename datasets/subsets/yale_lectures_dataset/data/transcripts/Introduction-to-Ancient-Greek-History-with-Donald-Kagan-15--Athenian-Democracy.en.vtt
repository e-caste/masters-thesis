00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:04.407
Professor Donald
Kagan: Okay,

00:00:04.407 --> 00:00:08.297
we were talking about the
development of the Athenian

00:00:08.297 --> 00:00:12.487
Empire changing from the
original character of the Delian

00:00:12.487 --> 00:00:15.262
League.
I think we had gotten to the

00:00:15.262 --> 00:00:18.289
Battle of Eurymedon,
which is generally dated to

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:21.976
469,
a great victory at land and sea

00:00:21.976 --> 00:00:27.510
over the Persians and the
feeling that it generated,

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.613
certainly in some portions of
the empire, that the threat from

00:00:32.613 --> 00:00:36.828
Persia was over,
and that created the problem of

00:00:36.828 --> 00:00:41.984
keeping the allies satisfied and
willing to make the kind of

00:00:41.984 --> 00:00:45.480
contribution that had been
necessary.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.789
The Athenians certainly had no
plan of abandoning the league,

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:54.215
of abandoning their leadership,
of giving up their assaults on

00:00:54.215 --> 00:00:58.195
the Persians and all of that.
So, that if there was a falling

00:00:58.195 --> 00:01:01.673
away the Athenians would be
wanting to do something about

00:01:01.673 --> 00:01:04.276
that.
Still another turning point

00:01:04.276 --> 00:01:08.489
in the character of the league,
a very important one I think,

00:01:08.489 --> 00:01:14.798
occurred in the year 465 when
the Island of Thasos in the

00:01:14.798 --> 00:01:21.147
northern Aegean Sea rebelled,
and this time the quarrel was

00:01:21.147 --> 00:01:27.158
not about doing the duty that
the members of the league had to

00:01:27.158 --> 00:01:30.263
do.
It was not something about an

00:01:30.263 --> 00:01:33.989
issue not wanting to take part
in campaigns,

00:01:33.989 --> 00:01:38.670
not wanting to make payments,
no nothing like that.

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.558
There was a quarrel between the
Athenians and the Thasians about

00:01:44.558 --> 00:01:49.980
some mines that were worked on
the land opposite Thasos.

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:54.318
Gold and silver,
very rich precious metal

00:01:54.318 --> 00:01:58.440
sources for the ancient Greek
world,

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.520
of which there were not many,
located on Mount Pangaean on

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.497
the mainland opposite Thasos.
Both states claimed those mines

00:02:07.497 --> 00:02:12.389
and it was a quarrel that was
really just about money.

00:02:12.389 --> 00:02:17.270
It was also a trading post up
there that both sides claimed to

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.866
have.
The Athenians had

00:02:19.866 --> 00:02:25.878
established a colony at a place
on the Strymon River up in that

00:02:25.878 --> 00:02:29.370
region called
ennea-hodoi,

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.426
the nine roads,
which would later,

00:02:31.426 --> 00:02:35.289
when the Athenians established
it as the colony would be called

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:38.690
Amphipolis.
All of that led to--and the

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.523
Thasians didn't like that.
The Athenians were moving into

00:02:42.523 --> 00:02:45.590
their sphere of influence and
giving them trouble.

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.813
So Thasos, as a consequence of
all of these quarrels,

00:02:49.813 --> 00:02:53.875
rebelled and it was a very
difficult siege that the

00:02:53.875 --> 00:02:57.862
Athenians had to employ.
Thasos is a relatively big

00:02:57.862 --> 00:03:00.651
island.
The Thasians were a pretty

00:03:00.651 --> 00:03:04.739
tough group to put down,
and the siege actually,

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:09.610
the war between Athens and
Thasos actually took something

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.129
like two years,
which is quite a long stretch

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:16.443
for any Greek combat and
certainly had not been typical

00:03:16.443 --> 00:03:19.758
of what the Athenians had been
able to do against other

00:03:19.758 --> 00:03:23.673
rebellions.
When the Thasians were finally

00:03:23.673 --> 00:03:28.268
forced to surrender,
the Athenians gave them the

00:03:28.268 --> 00:03:32.180
usual treatment to rebellious
states.

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.576
They made them take down
their walls, to give up their

00:03:36.576 --> 00:03:41.108
ships, and of course,
the Athenians took control of

00:03:41.108 --> 00:03:45.960
the mines and placed an
indemnity on the Thasians,

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:50.714
requiring that they should pay
the costs of the war for Athens,

00:03:50.714 --> 00:03:54.548
and imposed upon them
thereafter the same kind of a

00:03:54.548 --> 00:03:59.380
tribute that they imposed on
what came more and more to be,

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:03.938
and we call subject states.
Well, that wasn't the first

00:04:03.938 --> 00:04:07.888
time such a thing had happened
to one of the members of the

00:04:07.888 --> 00:04:10.809
league,
but what made it different was

00:04:10.809 --> 00:04:15.363
that the quarrel was not over
anything that had to do with the

00:04:15.363 --> 00:04:18.970
league.
It could easily be seen and

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:24.598
certainly was a way in which the
Athenians used the forces and

00:04:24.598 --> 00:04:29.303
the funds of the league to
achieve strictly Athenian

00:04:29.303 --> 00:04:32.461
advantages.
After all, there was no way

00:04:32.461 --> 00:04:36.197
that the league benefited from
having either Athens or Thasos

00:04:36.197 --> 00:04:39.175
exploit those mines.
It was not an issue for the

00:04:39.175 --> 00:04:41.751
league at all,
and yet the Athenians had taken

00:04:41.751 --> 00:04:45.529
their position as leaders of the
league to gain that advantage,

00:04:45.529 --> 00:04:49.470
and that's I think a very
important turning point.

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:53.562
We shall see that in the course
of that siege of Thasos,

00:04:53.562 --> 00:04:58.399
important events were happening
back in the mainland at Greece,

00:04:58.399 --> 00:05:00.800
which would change the nature
of things too,

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.759
but if we just think about the
league for a moment,

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:07.629
I think the Thasian rebellion
is a critical moment.

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:12.409
That is a good place for us to
look at the evaluation that the

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:15.699
ancient writers made of this
transition.

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:18.931
Our two sources,
our major source,

00:05:18.931 --> 00:05:23.910
of course, Thucydides and then
also Diodorus of Sicily,

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:28.669
deriving his opinions from
contemporary writers too,

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:34.175
come up with descriptions and
explanations of why the league

00:05:34.175 --> 00:05:39.214
changed from what had been a
free association of states

00:05:39.214 --> 00:05:44.440
pursuing a common goal to what
was legitimately called an

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:48.526
empire.
Here is what Diodorus says,

00:05:48.526 --> 00:05:52.406
"In general,
Athenians were making great

00:05:52.406 --> 00:05:57.678
gains in power and no longer
treated their allies with

00:05:57.678 --> 00:06:03.745
decency as they had done before.
Instead, they ruled with

00:06:03.745 --> 00:06:07.414
arrogance and violence.
For this reason,

00:06:07.414 --> 00:06:12.231
most of their allies could not
bear their harshness and spoke

00:06:12.231 --> 00:06:17.390
to one another of rebellion.
Some of them even disdained the

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:22.300
league council and acted
according to their own wishes."

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:27.125
So, Diodorus depicts a combined
situation of which there are

00:06:27.125 --> 00:06:31.870
thoughts of defection and actual
defections from Athens,

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:37.387
and blames this on the behavior
of the Athenians of a kind of a

00:06:37.387 --> 00:06:40.913
tyrannical sort.
Here's what Thucydides

00:06:40.913 --> 00:06:44.910
says, "Now, while there were
other causes of revolts,

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:50.064
the principal ones were the
failures in bringing in the

00:06:50.064 --> 00:06:55.075
tribute or their quota of ships,
and in some cases,

00:06:55.075 --> 00:07:00.083
refusal of military service.
For the Athenians exacted the

00:07:00.083 --> 00:07:04.038
tribute strictly and gave
offense by applying coercive

00:07:04.038 --> 00:07:08.141
measures to any who were
accustomed or unwilling to bear

00:07:08.141 --> 00:07:12.838
the hardships of service.
In some other respects too,

00:07:12.838 --> 00:07:18.209
the Athenians were no longer
equally agreeable as leaders.

00:07:18.209 --> 00:07:22.980
They would not take part in
expeditions on terms of equality

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:27.750
and they found it easy to reduce
those who had revolted."

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:32.613
Now, here's where Thucydides
differs from Diodorus,

00:07:32.613 --> 00:07:36.504
"For all this,
the allies themselves were

00:07:36.504 --> 00:07:42.242
responsible for most of them on
account of their aversion to

00:07:42.242 --> 00:07:46.675
military service,
in order to avoid being away

00:07:46.675 --> 00:07:51.144
from home got themselves rated
in sums of money instead of

00:07:51.144 --> 00:07:53.593
ships,
which they should pay in as

00:07:53.593 --> 00:07:55.790
their proportion of
contribution.

00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:58.672
Consequently,
the fleet of the Athenians was

00:07:58.672 --> 00:08:01.889
increased by the funds which
they contributed,

00:08:01.889 --> 00:08:05.735
while they themselves,
whenever they revolted entered

00:08:05.735 --> 00:08:09.949
on the war without preparation
and without experience."

00:08:09.949 --> 00:08:14.109
So, Thucydides certainly
agrees with what Diodorus says

00:08:14.109 --> 00:08:18.484
about the high handed manner in
which the Athenians had become

00:08:18.484 --> 00:08:22.357
accustomed to behave and the
offense they gave to their

00:08:22.357 --> 00:08:25.246
allies.
Well, he points out that the

00:08:25.246 --> 00:08:28.180
allies had gotten themselves
into that fix,

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:32.371
because many of them--and this
is an element Diodorus doesn't

00:08:32.371 --> 00:08:34.591
mention,
voluntarily said,

00:08:34.591 --> 00:08:38.450
okay, we're not going to do
this service anymore.

00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:41.334
Instead of supplying ships,
manning them,

00:08:41.334 --> 00:08:45.373
doing the service ourselves,
we'll pay the equivalent sum

00:08:45.373 --> 00:08:48.980
into the league treasury and
when they did so,

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:52.863
the Athenians took that money
and used it to pay for Athenian

00:08:52.863 --> 00:08:57.773
ships with Athenian rowers,
so that as the league forces

00:08:57.773 --> 00:09:02.649
grew smaller,
the Athenian navy grew bigger.

00:09:02.649 --> 00:09:05.340
So, Thucydides says,
it's their own fault.

00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:09.514
In some cases it was not,
but certainly in many a case,

00:09:09.514 --> 00:09:12.162
it was.
I think we should not think of

00:09:12.162 --> 00:09:15.482
Diodorus and Thucydides as
contradicting each other,

00:09:15.482 --> 00:09:19.837
they really are complimentary.
They're both telling the same

00:09:19.837 --> 00:09:23.490
story, but emphasizing a
different perspective.

00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:26.524
One looked at it from the
Athenian point of view,

00:09:26.524 --> 00:09:28.799
one from the allied point of
view.

00:09:28.799 --> 00:09:32.138
But they certainly are telling
it as it was,

00:09:32.138 --> 00:09:36.720
and if we look ahead toward the
end of the fifth century,

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:39.993
by the time we get to the
Peloponnesian War,

00:09:39.993 --> 00:09:44.789
of all the hundred and fifty or
more states that were members of

00:09:44.789 --> 00:09:50.661
the original Delian League,
only three still had a navy and

00:09:50.661 --> 00:09:55.759
real autonomy by the time the
war broke out.

00:09:55.759 --> 00:09:59.648
The three great islands off the
coast of Asia Minor,

00:09:59.648 --> 00:10:03.080
Lesbos, Chios,
and Samos were those states,

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:08.363
and sorry, I should have said
two, because by 440-439 Samos

00:10:08.363 --> 00:10:12.687
lost its independence.
So, there were only two states

00:10:12.687 --> 00:10:16.631
in that category.
Looking ahead that's what will

00:10:16.631 --> 00:10:21.155
happen, that's will be the end
of the Delian League,

00:10:21.155 --> 00:10:25.679
it will be the Athenian empire
in every respect.

00:10:25.679 --> 00:10:29.944
Now, while this development
was taking place we need to take

00:10:29.944 --> 00:10:33.870
a look at what was happening
back in the Greek world on the

00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:39.006
mainland,
and chiefly I think we should

00:10:39.006 --> 00:10:45.834
focus on Athens at this time.
There was right after the

00:10:45.834 --> 00:10:50.682
Persian War, as I said a few
words about it before,

00:10:50.682 --> 00:10:56.113
a rising competition for a
place of standing in the Greek

00:10:56.113 --> 00:10:58.313
world.
That is to say,

00:10:58.313 --> 00:11:02.015
before the Persian Wars were
over, Sparta had been

00:11:02.015 --> 00:11:06.624
unquestionably the leader of the
Greeks, when challenged by an

00:11:06.624 --> 00:11:09.363
outside force.
After the war,

00:11:09.363 --> 00:11:13.365
Themistocles,
you recall, and obviously with

00:11:13.365 --> 00:11:18.111
the Athenians at his back
asserted at the very least

00:11:18.111 --> 00:11:23.503
equality with the Spartans,
and certainly independence of

00:11:23.503 --> 00:11:27.663
any position following the
Spartans or any grant of

00:11:27.663 --> 00:11:32.493
leadership to the Spartans.
As I think I mentioned last

00:11:32.493 --> 00:11:37.310
time, the next fifty years or so
are the story of the competition

00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:41.827
between these two great powers
within the Greek world for who

00:11:41.827 --> 00:11:46.117
would be the leader and there
would be many a clash in the

00:11:46.117 --> 00:11:49.995
course of that time.
In Athens, the remarkable thing

00:11:49.995 --> 00:11:53.269
is, if you look at the internal
development of Athens,

00:11:53.269 --> 00:11:58.207
I think you would have said in
479, Themistocles is bound to

00:11:58.207 --> 00:12:03.480
rise to the top and become the
dominant politician in Athens,

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:08.477
because of his extraordinary
role in bringing victory to the

00:12:08.477 --> 00:12:11.055
Greeks.
But these things don't always

00:12:11.055 --> 00:12:13.966
happen that way.
I think of course about the

00:12:13.966 --> 00:12:17.044
Second World War,
where one might have thought

00:12:17.044 --> 00:12:20.942
the same thing about Winston
Churchill's future in English

00:12:20.942 --> 00:12:24.524
politics,
but no sooner was the war won

00:12:24.524 --> 00:12:29.683
and I think Churchill would have
had to gain and was given

00:12:29.683 --> 00:12:34.299
enormous credit for bringing
about that victory.

00:12:34.299 --> 00:12:38.127
There was an election,
almost immediately after the

00:12:38.127 --> 00:12:42.108
war, and Churchill was thrown
out and replaced by his

00:12:42.108 --> 00:12:45.967
opponents,
which tells you about the first

00:12:45.967 --> 00:12:51.003
rule of democratic politics,
the first important question

00:12:51.003 --> 00:12:55.500
that has to be put to all
politicians which is,

00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:57.289
what have you done for me
lately?

00:12:57.289 --> 00:12:58.919
Well, he had done quite a
lot lately.

00:12:58.919 --> 00:13:01.059
So, there's another question
that you have to put is,

00:13:01.059 --> 00:13:02.500
what are going to do for me
next?

00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:06.049
I think that was really what
was Churchill's problem.

00:13:06.049 --> 00:13:10.130
That was not Themistocles
problem, Themistocles ran into

00:13:10.130 --> 00:13:14.803
trouble because he was a kind of
a maverick in Athenian politics

00:13:14.803 --> 00:13:17.735
anyway,
although on at least on one

00:13:17.735 --> 00:13:21.811
side of his family he was a
nobleman like the typical

00:13:21.811 --> 00:13:26.542
Athenian leader.
He was not of the real sort of

00:13:26.542 --> 00:13:32.555
center of the aristocracy;
he was some kind of a less than

00:13:32.555 --> 00:13:37.149
extraordinary nobility in part
of his family,

00:13:37.149 --> 00:13:43.210
and his personality amid his
rivals found troubling,

00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:50.339
because he was not averse to
basking in the glory that he had

00:13:50.339 --> 00:13:52.976
won.
But think back,

00:13:52.976 --> 00:13:56.972
in the eighties,
in the years between Marathon

00:13:56.972 --> 00:14:02.032
and Salamis, on the one hand
Themistocles had been able to

00:14:02.032 --> 00:14:06.738
convince the Athenians to do
what they needed to do to

00:14:06.738 --> 00:14:10.389
survive,
to build that great fleet out

00:14:10.389 --> 00:14:15.269
of the silver mines that they
had been lucky enough to have.

00:14:15.269 --> 00:14:20.083
But also, he had managed,
if my reading of the facts is

00:14:20.083 --> 00:14:25.698
correct, to get rid of everyone
of his major political opponents

00:14:25.698 --> 00:14:29.710
by making use of the device of
ostracism.

00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:34.062
If you look at the eighties,
you will see that just about

00:14:34.062 --> 00:14:38.258
every important Athenian
political figure is ostracized

00:14:38.258 --> 00:14:41.289
with the exception of
Themistocles,

00:14:41.289 --> 00:14:45.512
who was left in great shape
while the other folks are gone,

00:14:45.512 --> 00:14:49.954
and when the Persians come the
ostracized men are recalled and

00:14:49.954 --> 00:14:54.011
play a role in the war,
and when the war is over it's

00:14:54.011 --> 00:14:57.257
obvious, I think,
that they are both not happy

00:14:57.257 --> 00:15:01.296
with what Themistocles had
achieved against them and also

00:15:01.296 --> 00:15:05.696
worried about their prospects
for the future with Themistocles

00:15:05.696 --> 00:15:08.870
being a bigger hero than he ever
was.

00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:11.055
So what,
I think, we need to understand

00:15:11.055 --> 00:15:14.230
is in Athenian politics in the
years after the Persian War,

00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:18.357
we must understand that there
is some kind of a coalition,

00:15:18.357 --> 00:15:22.615
formal or otherwise,
in which all the great leaders

00:15:22.615 --> 00:15:27.859
of the Athenian political world
combine to keep Themistocles

00:15:27.859 --> 00:15:29.823
down.
Amazingly enough,

00:15:29.823 --> 00:15:33.732
when we take a look at the
early actions of the Delian

00:15:33.732 --> 00:15:35.945
League,
and which in every case,

00:15:35.945 --> 00:15:38.097
you remember,
the commander of every

00:15:38.097 --> 00:15:41.741
expedition is an Athenian,
it's never Themistocles whom

00:15:41.741 --> 00:15:45.463
you would have imagined would
have been leading all these

00:15:45.463 --> 00:15:48.303
expeditions.
He just didn't have the

00:15:48.303 --> 00:15:51.429
political clout to get the
assignment.

00:15:51.429 --> 00:15:55.925
The man who did was a
relatively young man by the name

00:15:55.925 --> 00:15:59.875
of Cimon, a nobleman,
he was the son of Miltiades,

00:15:59.875 --> 00:16:04.299
the great hero at Marathon and
he started out his political

00:16:04.299 --> 00:16:09.493
career with problems.
His father had been condemned

00:16:09.493 --> 00:16:15.408
just before his death,
he had also left a very great

00:16:15.408 --> 00:16:21.919
debt that Cimon had to repay,
but Cimon established himself

00:16:21.919 --> 00:16:28.000
as a great figure in the Persian
Wars and very soon afterward,

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:33.305
we see him taking the lead in
every campaign pretty much that

00:16:33.305 --> 00:16:38.169
the Delian League launches.
He is stunningly successful;

00:16:38.169 --> 00:16:42.990
he's obviously a great
commander on land and at sea.

00:16:42.990 --> 00:16:46.850
He's in charge of the great
victory at Eurymedon.

00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:50.914
So, as Athens goes from
greatness to greatness,

00:16:50.914 --> 00:16:54.980
from success to success,
and glory to glory,

00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:58.863
and from wealth to wealth,
Cimon becomes this

00:16:58.863 --> 00:17:02.570
extraordinarily popular with the
masses.

00:17:02.570 --> 00:17:06.967
It's interesting,
because he was not the sort of

00:17:06.967 --> 00:17:10.990
a man, who appealed to the lower
classes.

00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:14.757
He was a nobleman himself and
he never backed off that,

00:17:14.757 --> 00:17:17.130
and as we shall see in a
moment,

00:17:17.130 --> 00:17:21.841
his prejudices about foreign
relations were not the popular

00:17:21.841 --> 00:17:24.561
ones.
He was a great supporter of

00:17:24.561 --> 00:17:28.706
Sparta, a great friend of
Sparta, who regularly spoke

00:17:28.706 --> 00:17:33.009
about the virtues of Sparta and
the Spartan system,

00:17:33.009 --> 00:17:36.240
and how Athens could learn
something from Sparta.

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:41.085
How such a man could have
been elected general year after

00:17:41.085 --> 00:17:45.607
year by the masses of the
Athenians is a question we need

00:17:45.607 --> 00:17:49.025
to approach.
But the virtues that he had

00:17:49.025 --> 00:17:53.119
were to some considerable degree
personal, that is,

00:17:53.119 --> 00:17:55.537
not only was,
I think first and foremost,

00:17:55.537 --> 00:17:58.981
was the enormous success he had
in commanding the Athenian

00:17:58.981 --> 00:18:02.184
forces that brought all the
things I had mentioned and

00:18:02.184 --> 00:18:05.471
wealth,
because the league expeditions

00:18:05.471 --> 00:18:09.890
attacking various Persian
territories brought booty,

00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:14.535
which was to some extent,
divided up among the armies

00:18:14.535 --> 00:18:18.857
that did the fighting.
So, the Athenian soldiers and

00:18:18.857 --> 00:18:23.286
sailors actually made a profit
out of these conquests of the

00:18:23.286 --> 00:18:27.190
Persian territory,
or raids on Persian territory.

00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:31.662
Naturally, their commander was
popular on that score,

00:18:31.662 --> 00:18:36.306
but he had those personal
skills that are successful in

00:18:36.306 --> 00:18:39.690
democratic politics.
People liked him.

00:18:39.690 --> 00:18:45.209
I'm reminded of the same
political phenomenon in America

00:18:45.209 --> 00:18:49.855
in the case of Eisenhower.
Eisenhower, of course,

00:18:49.855 --> 00:18:54.110
had first become a popular
politician because of his

00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:58.186
victory in the Second World War.
He was in command of the

00:18:58.186 --> 00:19:01.124
European theater and got all the
credit or a lot of the credit

00:19:01.124 --> 00:19:04.240
for the victory,
but he had these qualities that

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:07.862
made people like him,
of which trivial things can be

00:19:07.862 --> 00:19:11.514
very important.
In Eisenhower's case they liked

00:19:11.514 --> 00:19:15.190
his smile, people talked about
it all the time.

00:19:15.190 --> 00:19:20.106
It turned out he was unbeatable
in politics and it was a little

00:19:20.106 --> 00:19:23.039
bit like that in the case of
Cimon.

00:19:23.039 --> 00:19:25.830
Even though,
again, Eisenhower was not on

00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:29.180
the sort of the populous side of
these things,

00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:33.394
he was after all a republican
and it turned out he was pretty

00:19:33.394 --> 00:19:37.206
orthodox in that sense.
Well, Cimon held to a very

00:19:37.206 --> 00:19:40.564
conservative position,
as I will tell you about in

00:19:40.564 --> 00:19:41.730
just a moment,

00:19:44.759 --> 00:19:48.980
but the fact is he becomes the
dominant politician in Athens.

00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:54.649
If you think of him rising to
the top as early as 479 when the

00:19:54.649 --> 00:19:59.853
war is over and then we know
that his period of political

00:19:59.853 --> 00:20:03.849
success in Athens ends in the
year 462;

00:20:03.849 --> 00:20:07.487
that's a seventeen-year
stretch, which is a very,

00:20:07.487 --> 00:20:12.033
very long time for a politician
to continue to be the leading

00:20:12.033 --> 00:20:16.402
figure in the state in Athens.
Remember, an Athenian general,

00:20:16.402 --> 00:20:19.510
and it turns out that the
development of the Athenian

00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:22.019
democracy was that it was the
generals,

00:20:22.019 --> 00:20:27.378
who came to be the leading
figures politically in the

00:20:27.378 --> 00:20:33.150
state, and the generals have to
be elected every year.

00:20:33.150 --> 00:20:37.817
So think about how consistently
you have to be popular with the

00:20:37.817 --> 00:20:42.260
masses in order to achieve the
leadership that Cimon did.

00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:48.711
His pro-Spartan foreign
policy I think is a very

00:20:48.711 --> 00:20:51.205
critical part of the tale,
and I think things would have

00:20:51.205 --> 00:20:52.819
been very,
very different,

00:20:52.819 --> 00:20:55.955
if Themistocles had been the
dominant politician,

00:20:55.955 --> 00:20:59.940
because it was clear that from
what he'd already done and what

00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:03.860
he will do later that he was
anti-Spartan and urging Athenian

00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:07.780
independence from Sparta and
really hostility between the two

00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:11.440
sides.
Cimon--to the contrary;

00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:14.844
he was the official
representative of Sparta in

00:21:14.844 --> 00:21:17.960
Athens.
He had long family associations

00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:20.709
with them;
he went around explaining,

00:21:20.709 --> 00:21:24.975
as I said, the virtues of the
Spartans and how good it would

00:21:24.975 --> 00:21:27.940
be for Athens to emulate some of
them,

00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:32.663
but more important than that,
he was always in favor of a

00:21:32.663 --> 00:21:37.049
policy that had Athens and
Sparta allies together,

00:21:37.049 --> 00:21:43.319
equals as they had been in his
mind, in the great Persian War

00:21:43.319 --> 00:21:49.170
when fundamentally the Spartans
had led and won the great

00:21:49.170 --> 00:21:54.751
victory on land at Plataea,
the Athenians had led and won

00:21:54.751 --> 00:21:58.627
the victory at Salamis at sea,
and the two states

00:21:58.627 --> 00:22:02.362
collaborated,
cooperated, that's how the

00:22:02.362 --> 00:22:06.119
Greeks were free from the
Persian menace,

00:22:06.119 --> 00:22:11.097
and that's how Greece would
prosper and be safe in the

00:22:11.097 --> 00:22:15.989
future and it worked.
Some part of the fact that

00:22:15.989 --> 00:22:20.887
the Spartans did not object to
the developments in the Aegean

00:22:20.887 --> 00:22:25.786
and across the Aegean in which
Athens moved from being merely

00:22:25.786 --> 00:22:30.930
the leader of the coalition to
becoming an imperial power,

00:22:30.930 --> 00:22:34.984
stronger everyday.
The Spartans didn't do a thing

00:22:34.984 --> 00:22:37.789
about it in those early years.
Why not?

00:22:37.789 --> 00:22:42.307
I think a major reason was
because Cimon was the dominant

00:22:42.307 --> 00:22:46.220
figure in Athens.
They trusted Cimon;

00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:50.832
they knew that so long as he
was in that position he would

00:22:50.832 --> 00:22:55.768
not be a menace to Sparta and
that they could indeed live side

00:22:55.768 --> 00:23:00.140
by side in this way.
It was a stretch of time

00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:04.046
fifteen, seventeen,
something like that years,

00:23:04.046 --> 00:23:09.167
which was peaceful and as I say
probably would not have been

00:23:09.167 --> 00:23:14.374
without the phenomenon of the
internal developments in Athens

00:23:14.374 --> 00:23:15.590
itself.

00:23:18.589 --> 00:23:23.870
Cimon also--his control of
Athenian affairs by virtue of

00:23:23.870 --> 00:23:29.439
his personal standing and his
persuasive abilities are also

00:23:29.439 --> 00:23:34.151
surprising.
Marathon was a victory for

00:23:34.151 --> 00:23:36.794
hoplites.
It was the farmers,

00:23:36.794 --> 00:23:40.292
the middling group,
and those above them that had

00:23:40.292 --> 00:23:43.571
won that battle,
but Salamis was a victory for

00:23:43.571 --> 00:23:48.047
the poor in Athens.
Of course that vast fleet was

00:23:48.047 --> 00:23:53.032
rode by poor Athenians,
and now they had the glory for

00:23:53.032 --> 00:23:57.294
the victory and,
of course, after the war,

00:23:57.294 --> 00:24:03.630
when the fleet became the basis
of Athenian strength and glory,

00:24:03.630 --> 00:24:08.484
it was the common man and the
poorest of the Athenians,

00:24:08.484 --> 00:24:13.339
who was involved in achieving
that desirable status.

00:24:13.339 --> 00:24:17.629
So, you would have thought,
and if Themistocles had been in

00:24:17.629 --> 00:24:21.987
control, I'm sure he would have
been right that there would be a

00:24:21.987 --> 00:24:26.000
movement towards greater
democratization of the state.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:29.764
Remember where we are before
the wars begin is Cleisthenic

00:24:29.764 --> 00:24:33.329
democracy, which is pretty much
a hoplite democracy,

00:24:33.329 --> 00:24:37.872
which excludes the poor from
many of the activities of the

00:24:37.872 --> 00:24:41.240
state.
Cimon ran against that.

00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:47.289
He never tried to unravel
Athenian democracy.

00:24:47.289 --> 00:24:49.420
He was not an enemy of Athenian
democracy;

00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:55.601
he was in favor of keeping it
the way it was and in some ways

00:24:55.601 --> 00:25:00.650
actually rolling back some
degree of democracy.

00:25:00.650 --> 00:25:06.704
The way it was somewhat rolled
back was that--and not by any

00:25:06.704 --> 00:25:09.578
legal position,
legal action,

00:25:09.578 --> 00:25:15.119
but rather by sort of the way
events went forward.

00:25:15.119 --> 00:25:18.648
Aristotle in the
Constitution of the Athenians

00:25:18.648 --> 00:25:22.609
describes the stretch of time
that I'm talking about,

00:25:22.609 --> 00:25:27.175
about 479 to 462,
as the period of the

00:25:27.175 --> 00:25:33.570
Areopagites' constitution.
What that means is the old

00:25:33.570 --> 00:25:38.659
aristocratic council,
consisting of former top

00:25:38.659 --> 00:25:46.009
magistrates, gained unofficial,
informal, but very real power.

00:25:46.009 --> 00:25:49.673
Scholars have had a hard time
understanding exactly what it

00:25:49.673 --> 00:25:52.200
was that was the nature of that
power,

00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:56.203
but it looks as though a couple
of elements were certainly there

00:25:56.203 --> 00:26:00.446
and they were very critical.
That is, the Areopagus,

00:26:00.446 --> 00:26:04.711
it was said,
sort of regained the oversight

00:26:04.711 --> 00:26:08.258
of magistrates.
They were, as in the

00:26:08.258 --> 00:26:12.295
aristocratic past,
in the position of being able

00:26:12.295 --> 00:26:17.450
to criticize magistrates and to
take action against them,

00:26:17.450 --> 00:26:22.619
if they acted in a way that the
Areopagus did not approve.

00:26:22.619 --> 00:26:25.931
It also seems very
plausible that even though there

00:26:25.931 --> 00:26:28.630
continued to be a council of
five hundred,

00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:31.402
which was continuing to
function as it had,

00:26:31.402 --> 00:26:35.430
ever since the Cleisthenic
Constitution had established it,

00:26:35.430 --> 00:26:40.141
the fact is that more and more
the Areopagus was taking

00:26:40.141 --> 00:26:45.533
decisions about foreign policy,
was putting to the assembly

00:26:45.533 --> 00:26:50.747
when they desired motions,
they were usurping some of the

00:26:50.747 --> 00:26:55.159
powers of the five hundred.
They were not doing this,

00:26:55.159 --> 00:26:58.009
as I keep saying,
by any change of the law.

00:26:58.009 --> 00:27:00.804
They were doing it,
because they thought they

00:27:00.804 --> 00:27:03.089
could, and the people accepted
it.

00:27:03.089 --> 00:27:06.413
One reason for it,
according to Aristotle,

00:27:06.413 --> 00:27:10.952
is that they had played a
particularly heroic role in the

00:27:10.952 --> 00:27:16.140
Persian Wars at the moment when
the Persians invaded Attica,

00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:19.749
and the Athenians were forced
to flee their homes,

00:27:19.749 --> 00:27:23.211
and to go to Salamis,
and to the Peloponnesus to

00:27:23.211 --> 00:27:26.867
escape for that moment.
Now, the poor had no

00:27:26.867 --> 00:27:31.107
wherewithal to keep themselves
alive when they went into exile

00:27:31.107 --> 00:27:34.647
in this way,
and so the Areopagites used

00:27:34.647 --> 00:27:40.105
their own money to keep the poor
alive and in good condition

00:27:40.105 --> 00:27:45.493
during that period of time.
They volunteered that action,

00:27:45.493 --> 00:27:50.450
and that generosity and
patriotism, and goodwill allowed

00:27:50.450 --> 00:27:55.227
the development of this
Areopagite Constitution in the

00:27:55.227 --> 00:27:59.209
years that came,
and that's what Cimon I think

00:27:59.209 --> 00:28:04.212
really had in mind.
He wanted to have this sort of

00:28:04.212 --> 00:28:10.029
dual policy of conservative,
moderate democracy.

00:28:10.029 --> 00:28:14.800
Conservative in that it did not
take any recognition of the

00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:19.241
changing circumstances that
would have given the poor a

00:28:19.241 --> 00:28:24.093
better claim to political power
and also conservative in the

00:28:24.093 --> 00:28:29.028
sense that it was not going to
challenge the dualism of Greek

00:28:29.028 --> 00:28:33.925
international relations,
as it had emerged from the

00:28:33.925 --> 00:28:39.067
Persian War, and that's the
policy that Athens followed with

00:28:39.067 --> 00:28:44.121
tremendous success during the
late career of Cimon while he

00:28:44.121 --> 00:28:47.641
was at the head of affairs.
Remember,

00:28:47.641 --> 00:28:50.850
I keep saying he's at the head
of affairs and he's running

00:28:50.850 --> 00:28:53.664
things, but remember he's just
one of ten generals,

00:28:53.664 --> 00:28:58.707
who is elected every year.
So all his power--it's better

00:28:58.707 --> 00:29:04.960
to speak of his influence
because it's all unofficial.

00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:09.352
He is able to have these things
happen because people do what he

00:29:09.352 --> 00:29:12.420
urges them to do,
when they don't need to.

00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:17.242
There's no compulsion necessary;
he is the one who sets the tone

00:29:17.242 --> 00:29:20.350
and they follow him.
Centuries later,

00:29:20.350 --> 00:29:24.076
when Augustus becomes the boss
of the Roman world,

00:29:24.076 --> 00:29:28.258
his own statement of the
situation put the way he wanted

00:29:28.258 --> 00:29:33.614
people to think about it,
was that he was foremost not in

00:29:33.614 --> 00:29:39.566
power, potestas is the
Latin word, but rather in terms

00:29:39.566 --> 00:29:44.310
of his influence.
He wanted to say it was not a

00:29:44.310 --> 00:29:49.831
tyranny, it was not a monarchy,
it was a republic as it had

00:29:49.831 --> 00:29:54.292
always been and,
I Augustus, as the leading

00:29:54.292 --> 00:30:00.721
citizen in the eyes of my fellow
Romans am able persuade them to

00:30:00.721 --> 00:30:04.150
do these things,
not because they have to,

00:30:04.150 --> 00:30:07.434
but because they want to.
Well, that was his story and it

00:30:07.434 --> 00:30:10.680
wasn't true, because he had a
great big army at his back,

00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:12.755
and if you wanted to move him
out of anything,

00:30:12.755 --> 00:30:14.829
you would just have to get
yourself killed.

00:30:14.829 --> 00:30:18.160
This was not the situation with
Cimon.

00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:20.865
Cimon could have made that
speech and it would have been

00:30:20.865 --> 00:30:24.794
true.
So, all that cruises along

00:30:24.794 --> 00:30:30.170
until we get to the Thasian
Rebellion.

00:30:30.170 --> 00:30:34.772
Cimon is in charge of that
expedition and it proves to be a

00:30:34.772 --> 00:30:39.450
much tougher problem than any
that he has had to face before.

00:30:39.450 --> 00:30:43.420
The war extends for a long time;
there's no success.

00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:46.391
There's expense and no payoff,
and of course,

00:30:46.391 --> 00:30:50.511
there's some question as to the
legitimacy and decency of what

00:30:50.511 --> 00:30:54.770
is going on here.
So the enemies of Cimon--in a

00:30:54.770 --> 00:30:59.961
moment I'll tell you about them,
take advantage of the

00:30:59.961 --> 00:31:05.544
discontent that the Thasian
Rebellion is causing to launch

00:31:05.544 --> 00:31:11.518
an attack on Cimon politically
for the first time in anybody's

00:31:11.518 --> 00:31:14.286
memory.
The opponents,

00:31:14.286 --> 00:31:19.674
these enemies of Cimon,
are in the first instance a man

00:31:19.674 --> 00:31:25.960
called Ephialtes and very soon
it becomes clear that he has,

00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:30.707
as a kind of a lieutenant,
a younger man who was important

00:31:30.707 --> 00:31:35.456
but subordinate to Ephialtes.
That young man is Pericles,

00:31:35.456 --> 00:31:39.467
the son of Xanthippus,
Xanthippus the great Persian

00:31:39.467 --> 00:31:42.929
War hero.
We are told--it's very hard

00:31:42.929 --> 00:31:46.960
to disentangle the effects from
the stories here,

00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:51.200
but Ephialtes was supposed to
have been associated with

00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:54.184
Themistocles,
and that's very plausible

00:31:54.184 --> 00:31:58.660
because certainly Ephialtes
deserves to be thought of as a

00:31:58.660 --> 00:32:03.450
democratic leader with the
underlining of the democrat.

00:32:03.450 --> 00:32:06.769
He is clearly attempting to
make a change in the

00:32:06.769 --> 00:32:09.593
constitution,
de facto at the very

00:32:09.593 --> 00:32:12.935
least,
which would allow the naval

00:32:12.935 --> 00:32:18.498
crowd, the poor people of
Athens, who row in the fleets to

00:32:18.498 --> 00:32:22.890
have more political power and
opportunity,

00:32:22.890 --> 00:32:27.332
and he is also very strongly
anti-Spartan,

00:32:27.332 --> 00:32:33.833
so that he is opposed to both
halves of the Cimonian approach

00:32:33.833 --> 00:32:37.550
to things,
and he works at trying to

00:32:37.550 --> 00:32:42.423
undermine and to defeat Cimon.
He had no luck at all until

00:32:42.423 --> 00:32:45.950
Thasos, and then they bring
charges against Cimon.

00:32:45.950 --> 00:32:49.562
He hadn't done anything wrong.
All he had done was not win the

00:32:49.562 --> 00:32:51.813
war very quickly,
but you know you make up

00:32:51.813 --> 00:32:53.789
charges in the world of
politics.

00:32:53.789 --> 00:32:58.540
You've heard of that once or
twice, and they said,

00:32:58.540 --> 00:33:04.357
well, the reason he hadn't won
the war so quickly was because

00:33:04.357 --> 00:33:08.720
had been bribed by the King of
Macedonia,

00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:11.070
which is right behind the
territory we're talking about;

00:33:11.070 --> 00:33:14.950
not to conquer Macedonia.
Well, guess what?

00:33:14.950 --> 00:33:17.529
He wasn't under orders to
conquer Macedonia.

00:33:17.529 --> 00:33:22.105
He had no plan to conquer
Macedonia, didn't need to be

00:33:22.105 --> 00:33:26.597
bribed not to conquer Macedonia,
on top of which it would be

00:33:26.597 --> 00:33:29.943
pretty hard to bribe Cimon,
because although he had started

00:33:29.943 --> 00:33:32.019
out poor from his father's
debts,

00:33:32.019 --> 00:33:36.092
he was now an enormously rich
guy, because of the booty which

00:33:36.092 --> 00:33:40.233
he had legitimately acquired in
his role as commander of those

00:33:40.233 --> 00:33:42.642
expeditions.
Everybody knew he was

00:33:42.642 --> 00:33:45.762
incredibly rich and he was very
generous with his riches and

00:33:45.762 --> 00:33:47.720
gave it away in all sorts of
ways.

00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:51.705
If you want to say that a
Rockefeller is a no good,

00:33:51.705 --> 00:33:54.180
low down polecat;
that's fine.

00:33:54.180 --> 00:33:56.687
But if you want to say he's
being bribed with money all

00:33:56.687 --> 00:33:59.242
you're going to do is get
laughter out of something like

00:33:59.242 --> 00:34:02.817
that,
and in some way that is the

00:34:02.817 --> 00:34:09.030
situation with Cimon.
So, a trial is nonetheless

00:34:09.030 --> 00:34:16.449
launched against Cimon,
the complainant is Pericles,

00:34:16.449 --> 00:34:20.251
this young up and coming
democratic politician who makes

00:34:20.251 --> 00:34:23.540
the case against Cimon.
He loses;

00:34:23.540 --> 00:34:28.508
of course, he loses.
Cimon has not lost his support

00:34:28.508 --> 00:34:33.577
and the case is absurd.
It's just a sign that for the

00:34:33.577 --> 00:34:38.339
first time, there's some kind of
serious political opposition and

00:34:38.339 --> 00:34:42.463
who is involved in it.
Even before that trial

00:34:42.463 --> 00:34:47.076
Ephialtes had tried another
technique by attacking the

00:34:47.076 --> 00:34:51.690
Areopagus through a tax on
particular Areopagites.

00:34:51.690 --> 00:34:55.443
If you don't have any success
in the general political arena,

00:34:55.443 --> 00:34:58.634
one device that is as old as
the hills and as new as

00:34:58.634 --> 00:35:01.670
yesterday,
is you try to discredit

00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:06.929
individuals in the regime that
you're trying to unseat,

00:35:06.929 --> 00:35:09.295
and so various charges were
brought against,

00:35:09.295 --> 00:35:10.890
in particular,
Areopagites.

00:35:10.890 --> 00:35:12.940
They have had merit;
they might not.

00:35:12.940 --> 00:35:16.280
The goal was to discredit the
Areopagus as a whole.

00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:20.373
Again, did not succeed in the
years that I am talking about,

00:35:20.373 --> 00:35:24.190
these are just the signs of
what we're talking about,

00:35:24.190 --> 00:35:31.740
which takes us to the years
just after the putting down of

00:35:31.740 --> 00:35:36.582
the Thasian Rebellion.
This is an enormous

00:35:36.582 --> 00:35:40.703
argument among scholars that
never will go away about just

00:35:40.703 --> 00:35:44.679
what is the date of the terrible
earthquake that hit the

00:35:44.679 --> 00:35:51.674
Peloponnesus in whatever time.
The most common opinion is that

00:35:51.674 --> 00:35:58.300
it was around 464 and that
appeals to me too.

00:35:58.300 --> 00:36:02.627
The earthquake was so serious
as to disrupt life in Sparta and

00:36:02.627 --> 00:36:07.507
in Spartan territory in general,
and thereby to encourage a

00:36:07.507 --> 00:36:12.347
great helot rebellion,
so that the latter even after

00:36:12.347 --> 00:36:17.442
the earthquake was over,
was what occupied and terrified

00:36:17.442 --> 00:36:20.954
the Spartans,
and it was serious enough that

00:36:20.954 --> 00:36:25.611
they sent out to their allies,
and I'm not now talking merely

00:36:25.611 --> 00:36:28.750
about their allies in the
Peloponnesian League,

00:36:28.750 --> 00:36:32.660
in their allies who had joined
them in the Greek League against

00:36:32.660 --> 00:36:35.119
Persia, which was still on the
books,

00:36:35.119 --> 00:36:38.658
asking them to send help
against the helots,

00:36:38.658 --> 00:36:43.748
and a number of them did.
It's indicative of what the

00:36:43.748 --> 00:36:49.484
relationship between Athens and
Sparta was that they also asked

00:36:49.484 --> 00:36:54.328
for help to Athens.
There was a great debate in the

00:36:54.328 --> 00:36:59.584
Athenian assembly as to what
answer to give the Spartans in

00:36:59.584 --> 00:37:03.741
their request for help,
and Cimon of course,

00:37:03.741 --> 00:37:07.253
made the case for doing so,
and in fact,

00:37:07.253 --> 00:37:12.836
he proposed that the Athenians
send a very large force as these

00:37:12.836 --> 00:37:18.239
things go in the Greek world of
four thousand hoplites.

00:37:18.239 --> 00:37:21.793
That's a very big army,
the Athenians very rarely sent

00:37:21.793 --> 00:37:25.950
an army of that size outside of
Athens into the Peloponnesus to

00:37:25.950 --> 00:37:28.699
help the Spartans against the
helots.

00:37:28.699 --> 00:37:35.108
He made the case that
Athens should not abandon its

00:37:35.108 --> 00:37:40.291
former ally;
he spoke in panhellenic terms

00:37:40.291 --> 00:37:47.576
using a nice folk expression he
said, Greece should not allow

00:37:47.576 --> 00:37:53.413
this kind of a split.
Athens should not lose its yoke

00:37:53.413 --> 00:37:58.789
fellow, and the image was a team
of oxen drawing a plow,

00:37:58.789 --> 00:38:02.932
Athens and Sparta being that
team, and so long as they're in

00:38:02.932 --> 00:38:05.460
the same yoke and doing the
thing,

00:38:05.460 --> 00:38:08.599
all will be well;
Greece will be safe.

00:38:08.599 --> 00:38:10.950
There will be no internal
strife.

00:38:10.950 --> 00:38:13.829
There will be no war;
that's what we ought to do.

00:38:13.829 --> 00:38:19.341
Ephialtes spoke bitterly
against that and spoke in terms

00:38:19.341 --> 00:38:25.320
of--this story is all told in
Plutarch's Life of Cimon,

00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:27.280
if you want to have a look at
that.

00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:31.112
He seems to have evidence about
what was said at this debate in

00:38:31.112 --> 00:38:34.943
the assembly,
and Ephialtes is supposed to

00:38:34.943 --> 00:38:40.646
have said something like the
arrogance of Sparta must be

00:38:40.646 --> 00:38:45.519
trampled underfoot and he lost
the argument.

00:38:45.519 --> 00:38:48.550
Cimon once again won the
argument.

00:38:48.550 --> 00:38:52.785
Athens sends a force of the
four thousand hoplites down into

00:38:52.785 --> 00:38:55.246
the Peloponnesus.
They were called on

00:38:55.246 --> 00:38:58.880
especially--The Spartans wanted
them, because the helots had run

00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:03.680
away to Mount Ethoni in Mycenae,
which was a fortified place on

00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:08.563
a mountain, very hard to attack.
The Spartans had failed in

00:39:08.563 --> 00:39:12.559
their efforts to besiege or to
storm the position there,

00:39:12.559 --> 00:39:16.293
and the Athenians had a
reputation now of being very

00:39:16.293 --> 00:39:19.374
good at siege warfare,
which they had gained at the

00:39:19.374 --> 00:39:22.126
end of the Persian War.
As you remember,

00:39:22.126 --> 00:39:26.894
Xanthippus had besieged and
taken Sestos in a very effective

00:39:26.894 --> 00:39:29.465
way.
Well, the Athenians went and

00:39:29.465 --> 00:39:32.544
had a shot at it and failed,
at which point,

00:39:32.544 --> 00:39:37.199
the Spartans were a little bit
less keen on having them there,

00:39:37.199 --> 00:39:41.702
and then very soon after that
the Spartans went to the

00:39:41.702 --> 00:39:45.695
Athenians and said,
thank you very much for your

00:39:45.695 --> 00:39:50.177
contribution,
we have no further need of your

00:39:50.177 --> 00:39:55.132
services, have a nice trip home.
Instead of being very grateful

00:39:55.132 --> 00:39:57.889
and happy that they didn't have
to fight anymore,

00:39:57.889 --> 00:40:01.954
the Athenians were insulted.
None of the other allies was

00:40:01.954 --> 00:40:04.639
asked to leave;
none of the others were gone.

00:40:04.639 --> 00:40:08.683
The Athenians clearly had been
sent away not out of friendly

00:40:08.683 --> 00:40:12.726
reasons, and Thucydides tells us
what was on the mind of the

00:40:12.726 --> 00:40:15.329
Spartans who made these
decisions.

00:40:15.329 --> 00:40:19.428
They had developed a fear
of the Athenian soldiers who

00:40:19.428 --> 00:40:21.370
were in the Peloponnesus.

00:40:24.469 --> 00:40:28.559
Typically, Spartans don't get
to see or know anybody else.

00:40:28.559 --> 00:40:31.604
The only time they ever get to
see foreigners is if they happen

00:40:31.604 --> 00:40:33.469
to be fighting side by side
briefly.

00:40:33.469 --> 00:40:36.847
But now you can imagine the
scene where these ordinary

00:40:36.847 --> 00:40:40.670
everyday Athenians having been
born and raised in a democracy

00:40:40.670 --> 00:40:44.429
where there was absolute freedom
and freedom of speech,

00:40:44.429 --> 00:40:50.675
and where their style of life
is not bad for Greeks by Greek

00:40:50.675 --> 00:40:57.237
standards, and you can imagine
inviting these Athenian soldiers

00:40:57.237 --> 00:41:02.530
in for a meal and feeding them a
Spartan meal,

00:41:02.530 --> 00:41:09.611
black soup and the Athenians
think, this is what you give the

00:41:09.611 --> 00:41:12.572
helots, right.
You're not going to eat that

00:41:12.572 --> 00:41:14.650
stuff.
You want us to eat that stuff?

00:41:14.650 --> 00:41:18.172
I wouldn't feed it to a pig.
I'm inventing the

00:41:18.172 --> 00:41:20.856
conversation,
but you got the general idea,

00:41:20.856 --> 00:41:24.500
and the Spartans couldn't have
enjoyed that very much.

00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:28.898
Then as they looked around and
saw what kind of state this was

00:41:28.898 --> 00:41:32.360
in which there were all these
enslaved people,

00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:35.613
these vast numbers of enslaved
people, not the kind of slaves

00:41:35.613 --> 00:41:38.394
they knew about,
the ones who were like a

00:41:38.394 --> 00:41:43.206
handyman who assisted you on the
farm--vast numbers of them doing

00:41:43.206 --> 00:41:46.889
all the work while the Spartans
didn't do any.

00:41:46.889 --> 00:41:50.760
Then they saw that business was
run by a small group of people,

00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:54.256
that the average Spartan
solider had nothing to say about

00:41:54.256 --> 00:41:58.195
what was going on,
and being Athenians they no

00:41:58.195 --> 00:42:04.117
doubt said something about that.
Thucydides says that the

00:42:04.117 --> 00:42:09.591
Spartans became fearful that
they would in fact help the

00:42:09.591 --> 00:42:15.663
helots in a rebellion against
the Spartans and that in general

00:42:15.663 --> 00:42:20.840
the Spartans feared their
revolutionary spirit,

00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:23.679
and it was on that ground that
they sent them away.

00:42:23.679 --> 00:42:26.039
In any case,
there was no doubt in the minds

00:42:26.039 --> 00:42:28.617
of the Athenians,
they had been sent away not in

00:42:28.617 --> 00:42:31.769
an honorable way,
in which friends treat friends,

00:42:31.769 --> 00:42:35.421
but they had been dismissed.
When they came home they were

00:42:35.421 --> 00:42:38.309
furious that they had gone in
the first place,

00:42:38.309 --> 00:42:41.845
angry with Cimon for sending
them and for,

00:42:41.845 --> 00:42:46.070
of course, his pro-Spartan
position in general.

00:42:46.070 --> 00:42:53.730
In the spring of 462--461 is it?
I think it's 461.

00:42:53.730 --> 00:42:59.119
They ostracized Cimon and off
he went.

00:42:59.119 --> 00:43:05.766
That was the deadly stroke
in what was now--what could

00:43:05.766 --> 00:43:11.829
fairly be called a political
revolution in Athens.

00:43:11.829 --> 00:43:14.739
It was not brought about by
force;

00:43:14.739 --> 00:43:19.307
it was brought about in the
constitutional way,

00:43:19.307 --> 00:43:25.065
but it nonetheless put an end
to a whole stretch of time in

00:43:25.065 --> 00:43:30.923
which the state was run in a
certain way and brought about a

00:43:30.923 --> 00:43:36.858
new development let us say,
a development towards a fuller

00:43:36.858 --> 00:43:41.910
democracy, but it's immediate
consequences were a complete

00:43:41.910 --> 00:43:46.414
breach with Sparta.
The Athenians renounced their

00:43:46.414 --> 00:43:50.730
old alliance made in the
Hellenic League in 481.

00:43:50.730 --> 00:43:55.947
That was over.
They turned around and made

00:43:55.947 --> 00:44:00.720
alliances with Argos,
Sparta's bitter Peloponnesian

00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:03.284
enemy.
They made an alliance with

00:44:03.284 --> 00:44:05.644
people in the north,
the Thessalians,

00:44:05.644 --> 00:44:08.070
who were famous for their
cavalry,

00:44:08.070 --> 00:44:12.663
and the implication of that
being that the Athenians had

00:44:12.663 --> 00:44:17.090
warlike intentions against the
Spartans signing up,

00:44:17.090 --> 00:44:20.138
first of all,
with their most famous local

00:44:20.138 --> 00:44:24.152
enemy and then signing up for
the opportunity to have a

00:44:24.152 --> 00:44:28.341
cavalry to use as well,
and indeed as we will see,

00:44:28.341 --> 00:44:33.291
it did lead very soon to a war
between Athens and Sparta and

00:44:33.291 --> 00:44:38.660
their two sets of allies in what
modern historians call the first

00:44:38.660 --> 00:44:43.115
Peloponnesian War.
But before we get to that,

00:44:43.115 --> 00:44:47.746
I think we want to attend to
the great changes in Athens

00:44:47.746 --> 00:44:53.050
internally that were brought
about by this great revolution.

00:44:53.050 --> 00:44:57.499
I think first thing we need to
do is, to dispose of Ephialtes,

00:44:57.499 --> 00:45:01.220
which is what his enemies did
almost immediately.

00:45:01.220 --> 00:45:04.852
He was murdered;
somebody came and stuck a knife

00:45:04.852 --> 00:45:07.429
in him.
It's very interesting;

00:45:07.429 --> 00:45:12.622
this is the only political
assassination that we know of in

00:45:12.622 --> 00:45:16.829
the entire history of the
Athenian democracy.

00:45:16.829 --> 00:45:21.920
When you think of how few were
the methods for protecting

00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:26.920
anybody in the Athenian state,
it really is a remarkable

00:45:26.920 --> 00:45:29.708
thing.
Sometimes I think when you look

00:45:29.708 --> 00:45:33.161
back at the history of the
United States and the number of

00:45:33.161 --> 00:45:36.293
presidents,
who have either been killed or

00:45:36.293 --> 00:45:39.110
shot at, attempts made to kill
them;

00:45:39.110 --> 00:45:43.157
it's quite extraordinary that
the Athenians--this is the only

00:45:43.157 --> 00:45:47.383
case we know.
Nobody knows to this day who

00:45:47.383 --> 00:45:51.484
committed it;
there were various rumors of

00:45:51.484 --> 00:45:57.007
which one is obviously inspired
by political considerations and

00:45:57.007 --> 00:46:00.615
hard to believe,
claims that Pericles killed him

00:46:00.615 --> 00:46:03.950
in order to clear the way for
his own leadership of the

00:46:03.950 --> 00:46:06.436
democratic faction.
I don't think we need to

00:46:06.436 --> 00:46:08.167
take that seriously,
but that was one of the

00:46:08.167 --> 00:46:10.762
charges.
More likely the murder was

00:46:10.762 --> 00:46:14.902
brought about by disgruntled
Cimonians, disgruntled

00:46:14.902 --> 00:46:17.992
conservatives,
disgruntled aristocrats,

00:46:17.992 --> 00:46:21.917
people who were very angry at
the turn of events that had

00:46:21.917 --> 00:46:27.308
changed everything in Athens.
But if we look at the situation

00:46:27.308 --> 00:46:32.893
in Athens in 461,460 and so on,
we are seeing a movement

00:46:32.893 --> 00:46:38.579
towards a democratic--I don't
want to say revolution,

00:46:38.579 --> 00:46:45.674
I suppose, but a rapid movement
to make the city of Athens more

00:46:45.674 --> 00:46:49.679
democratic than it ever had
been.

00:46:49.679 --> 00:46:56.183
I'd like to turn next to the
story of what that full blown

00:46:56.183 --> 00:47:01.660
Athenian democracy was like and
how it worked.

00:47:04.659 --> 00:47:08.920
Let me just remind you that
in the decade before 500,

00:47:08.920 --> 00:47:12.039
if we go back to the
Cleisthenic world,

00:47:12.039 --> 00:47:15.567
the Greeks who lived in the
city state called Athens

00:47:15.567 --> 00:47:19.440
established the world's first
democratic constitution.

00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:25.468
But this new kind of government
was carried to its classical

00:47:25.468 --> 00:47:31.904
stage by the reforms of Pericles
a half a century later in these

00:47:31.904 --> 00:47:36.641
years between 460 and 450;
that's really when most of the

00:47:36.641 --> 00:47:40.518
action took place.
It was in the Athens shaped by

00:47:40.518 --> 00:47:45.874
Pericles that the greatest
achievements of the Greek world

00:47:45.874 --> 00:47:49.335
took place.
We should remember that the

00:47:49.335 --> 00:47:54.420
rest of the world continued to
be characterized by monarchical,

00:47:54.420 --> 00:48:00.274
rigidly, hierarchical command
societies, while in Athens

00:48:00.274 --> 00:48:07.300
democracy was carried as far as
it would go before modern times.

00:48:07.300 --> 00:48:11.196
Perhaps,
if you look at it in a certain

00:48:11.196 --> 00:48:16.856
way, further than at any other
place and time and I'm going to

00:48:16.856 --> 00:48:22.701
start asking you to be aware of
your prejudices and to hold them

00:48:22.701 --> 00:48:25.960
lightly,
so that you can have the most

00:48:25.960 --> 00:48:29.949
full understanding of things
that may have the same names,

00:48:29.949 --> 00:48:33.106
but really were very different
from things that we are

00:48:33.106 --> 00:48:37.277
accustomed to.
One thing that's worth pointing

00:48:37.277 --> 00:48:43.193
out right away was in Athenian
democracy the access to the

00:48:43.193 --> 00:48:49.733
political process was limited in
Athens to adult males of native

00:48:49.733 --> 00:48:54.425
parentage.
Athenian citizenship granted

00:48:54.425 --> 00:49:01.031
full and active participation in
every decision of the state

00:49:01.031 --> 00:49:07.750
without regard to the wealth or
the class of the citizen.

00:49:07.750 --> 00:49:10.481
In the 450s,
under Pericles leadership,

00:49:10.481 --> 00:49:14.252
the Athenian assembly passed a
series of laws that went far

00:49:14.252 --> 00:49:17.243
towards establishing a
constitution that was as

00:49:17.243 --> 00:49:20.820
thoroughly democratic as the
world has ever seen.

00:49:20.820 --> 00:49:26.306
It gave direct and ultimate
power to the citizens in the

00:49:26.306 --> 00:49:32.590
assembly and in the popular law
courts where the people made all

00:49:32.590 --> 00:49:36.579
decisions by a simple majority
vote,

00:49:36.579 --> 00:49:42.699
and it provided for the
selection of most public offices

00:49:42.699 --> 00:49:49.041
by allotment for the direct
election of a very special few

00:49:49.041 --> 00:49:55.160
and for short terms of office
and close control over all

00:49:55.160 --> 00:49:59.073
public officials.
We need to have a clear

00:49:59.073 --> 00:50:02.073
understanding of the kind of
regime Pericles reforms

00:50:02.073 --> 00:50:04.437
produced.
For I don't think it's easy

00:50:04.437 --> 00:50:07.591
for citizens of what are called
democracies in the twentieth

00:50:07.591 --> 00:50:09.448
century,
twenty-first century,

00:50:09.448 --> 00:50:13.134
to comprehend the character of
the democracy of ancient Athens

00:50:13.134 --> 00:50:16.699
and the role that it played in
the life of its citizens.

00:50:16.699 --> 00:50:22.202
To a degree that's hard for us
to grasp, politics was primary

00:50:22.202 --> 00:50:27.795
in the ancient Greek city and
the form of the constitution was

00:50:27.795 --> 00:50:33.940
understood and expected to shape
the character of its citizens.

00:50:33.940 --> 00:50:36.842
The art, the literature,
the philosophy,

00:50:36.842 --> 00:50:41.457
and all the great achievements
of Periclean in Athens cannot be

00:50:41.457 --> 00:50:45.302
fully understood,
apart from their political and

00:50:45.302 --> 00:50:49.410
constitutional context,
in the democracy established by

00:50:49.410 --> 00:50:53.289
Cleisthenes and then extended by
Pericles later.

00:50:53.289 --> 00:50:58.241
I think a place to start with a
description of the Athenian

00:50:58.241 --> 00:51:03.449
democracy is with some attempt
at a definition of the term.

00:51:03.449 --> 00:51:07.173
Developments in the modern
world make that really hard,

00:51:07.173 --> 00:51:11.309
for the word has become debased
and is almost meaningless.

00:51:11.309 --> 00:51:15.333
Few modern states will
admit to being anything but

00:51:15.333 --> 00:51:18.138
democratic.
That is confusing enough,

00:51:18.138 --> 00:51:20.829
but there are further
complications.

00:51:20.829 --> 00:51:25.767
Many people today would insist
that to qualify as a democracy,

00:51:25.767 --> 00:51:29.895
a state must offer full
constitutional and political

00:51:29.895 --> 00:51:34.751
protections and opportunities to
all who have legal permanent

00:51:34.751 --> 00:51:39.769
residence within its borders and
who desire citizenship.

00:51:39.769 --> 00:51:44.222
But the Athenians limited the
right to vote,

00:51:44.222 --> 00:51:48.570
to hold office,
to serve on juries to adult

00:51:48.570 --> 00:51:54.136
males who were citizens.
Slaves, resident aliens,

00:51:54.136 --> 00:52:00.693
women, and male citizens under
the age of twenty were denied

00:52:00.693 --> 00:52:05.206
all these privileges.
Modern critics of ancient

00:52:05.206 --> 00:52:08.773
Athens question the democratic
character of the Periclean

00:52:08.773 --> 00:52:11.337
regime,
because of the presence of

00:52:11.337 --> 00:52:15.489
slavery and the exclusion of
women from political life.

00:52:15.489 --> 00:52:20.818
In excluding such groups,
the Athenians were like every

00:52:20.818 --> 00:52:26.147
other society since the
invention of civilization about

00:52:26.147 --> 00:52:29.550
3000 B.C.
until just recently.

00:52:29.550 --> 00:52:33.902
So, it's really not too
interesting or amazing to point

00:52:33.902 --> 00:52:37.610
out this shortcoming from our
point of view.

00:52:37.610 --> 00:52:42.294
What sets the Athenians apart,
are not these exclusions,

00:52:42.294 --> 00:52:47.149
but the unusually large degree
of inclusion as well as the

00:52:47.149 --> 00:52:52.515
extraordinarily significant and
rewarding participation of those

00:52:52.515 --> 00:52:56.675
who were included.
It's useful to remember

00:52:56.675 --> 00:53:01.064
that what has been called the
Jacksonian Democracy in the

00:53:01.064 --> 00:53:04.983
United States coexisted with
slavery in its fullest

00:53:04.983 --> 00:53:09.215
moments--that women were
everywhere denied the right to

00:53:09.215 --> 00:53:12.349
vote until the twentieth
century,

00:53:12.349 --> 00:53:18.340
and that we continued to limit
political participation to those

00:53:18.340 --> 00:53:22.621
of a specified age.
To deny the title of democracy

00:53:22.621 --> 00:53:26.599
to Pericles in Athens,
because of those excluded would

00:53:26.599 --> 00:53:31.102
be to employ a parochial and an
anachronistic set of criteria

00:53:31.102 --> 00:53:34.030
that produced paradoxical
results.

00:53:34.030 --> 00:53:39.349
Certainly no contemporary Greek
doubted that Athens was a

00:53:39.349 --> 00:53:42.938
democracy.
The only argument was whether a

00:53:42.938 --> 00:53:47.361
democracy was good or bad,
which is almost an unthinkable

00:53:47.361 --> 00:53:51.604
question to put in our time.
To look at it from the

00:53:51.604 --> 00:53:55.539
other end, the Athenians would
have been astonished at the

00:53:55.539 --> 00:53:58.300
claim of modern states to that
title,

00:53:58.300 --> 00:54:01.440
even such states as the United
States and Great Britain.

00:54:01.440 --> 00:54:04.827
For, to them,
an essential feature of

00:54:04.827 --> 00:54:10.474
democracy was the direct and
full sovereignty of the majority

00:54:10.474 --> 00:54:13.895
of citizens.
Government by elected

00:54:13.895 --> 00:54:17.180
representatives,
checks and balances,

00:54:17.180 --> 00:54:22.684
separation of powers,
appointment to important

00:54:22.684 --> 00:54:27.105
offices, unelected
bureaucracies,

00:54:27.105 --> 00:54:32.851
judicial life tenure,
terms for elective office of

00:54:32.851 --> 00:54:36.934
more than one year,
all of these would have seen

00:54:36.934 --> 00:54:41.711
clear and deadly enemies of what
reasonable people might

00:54:41.711 --> 00:54:46.622
understand by democracy.
So, these differences between

00:54:46.622 --> 00:54:51.737
ancient and modern ideas require
a brief examination of how the

00:54:51.737 --> 00:54:55.491
Athenian democracy worked,
if we are to shed our

00:54:55.491 --> 00:54:58.474
prejudices and grasp the
character of a form of

00:54:58.474 --> 00:55:02.690
government that is as rare as
any in the history of the world,

00:55:02.690 --> 00:55:08.348
and that probably never existed
in anything like the same form

00:55:08.348 --> 00:55:11.780
after the end of Athenian
autonomy.

00:55:11.780 --> 00:55:16.077
So I like to use a helpful,
if an anachronistic advice by

00:55:16.077 --> 00:55:20.304
considering the three familiar
branches into which we divide

00:55:20.304 --> 00:55:24.719
government: legislative,
executive, and judiciary.

00:55:24.719 --> 00:55:28.645
At the heart of what we would
call the legislative branch of

00:55:28.645 --> 00:55:31.440
the Athenian democracy was the
assembly;

00:55:31.440 --> 00:55:36.285
their word was ecclesia.
It was open to all the adult

00:55:36.285 --> 00:55:39.809
male citizens of Athens,
during Pericles lifetime;

00:55:39.809 --> 00:55:46.800
these may have been 40,000
possibly as many as 50,000 men.

00:55:46.800 --> 00:55:51.900
Now, most Athenians lived many
miles from the city.

00:55:51.900 --> 00:55:56.638
Few owned horses;
so attendance required a very

00:55:56.638 --> 00:55:59.694
long walk to town.
So as a result,

00:55:59.694 --> 00:56:04.599
the number taking part normally
was well short of that.

00:56:04.599 --> 00:56:10.989
It was probably from 5,000 to
6,000 people.

00:56:10.989 --> 00:56:15.603
One reason for saying that
is there was a quorum for some

00:56:15.603 --> 00:56:19.139
actions that you had to have at
6,000 votes.

00:56:19.139 --> 00:56:22.741
On the one hand that tells us,
I think, that there were

00:56:22.741 --> 00:56:26.210
probably more than that who
attended the assembly.

00:56:26.210 --> 00:56:28.747
You wouldn't make a quorum
being everybody who ever

00:56:28.747 --> 00:56:30.980
attended the place,
but on the other hand,

00:56:30.980 --> 00:56:35.813
it suggests that were many
assemblies with fewer than 6,000

00:56:35.813 --> 00:56:38.405
votes.
The meetings took place

00:56:38.405 --> 00:56:43.259
outside, on a hill called the
Pnyx, not far from the

00:56:43.259 --> 00:56:47.110
Acropolis and overlooking the
agora.

00:56:47.110 --> 00:56:52.667
Citizens sat on the earth of
this sharply sloping hill and

00:56:52.667 --> 00:56:56.469
the speakers stood on a low
platform.

00:56:56.469 --> 00:57:00.630
It was not easy for them to
make themselves heard.

00:57:00.630 --> 00:57:03.840
You can imagine,
it's an outdoor place;

00:57:03.840 --> 00:57:07.560
they don't have microphones.
The great fourth century

00:57:07.560 --> 00:57:10.432
orators are said to have
practiced--well,

00:57:10.432 --> 00:57:13.054
Demosthenes,
the greatest of them,

00:57:13.054 --> 00:57:17.098
was said to have practices
speaking at the seashore over

00:57:17.098 --> 00:57:21.510
the crashing surf to make his
voice strong enough to be heard

00:57:21.510 --> 00:57:25.233
on the Pnyx.
A good loud voice was really a

00:57:25.233 --> 00:57:28.780
terrific asset for an Athenian
politician.

00:57:28.780 --> 00:57:32.555
You get some idea of the
opening of these meetings from a

00:57:32.555 --> 00:57:36.599
comic version that is given to
us in Aristophanes' comedy,

00:57:36.599 --> 00:57:39.960
Acharnians,
performed in the year 425.

00:57:39.960 --> 00:57:44.325
The speaker is a typical
aristophanic comic hero,

00:57:44.325 --> 00:57:48.468
an old fashioned farmer from
the back woods who complains

00:57:48.468 --> 00:57:51.914
about the war,
the war is now about six years

00:57:51.914 --> 00:57:55.932
old, because it keeps him in
Athens, away from his farm in

00:57:55.932 --> 00:57:58.681
the country.
I quote now from the

00:57:58.681 --> 00:58:03.840
aristophanic passage,
"it is the day of an assembly,"

00:58:03.840 --> 00:58:06.693
he says--by the way,
he's sitting there all by

00:58:06.693 --> 00:58:09.420
himself on the Pnyx,
nobody has come yet,

00:58:09.420 --> 00:58:13.267
and there he is complaining.
"It is the day of an assembly

00:58:13.267 --> 00:58:16.099
and already morning,
but the Pnyx is deserted.

00:58:16.099 --> 00:58:18.728
They are chattering in the
agora,

00:58:18.728 --> 00:58:22.839
dodging the rope dripping with
red dye"--that's a reference to

00:58:22.839 --> 00:58:26.546
the fact the Athenians were
always slow to come from the

00:58:26.546 --> 00:58:28.630
marketplace,
the agora,

00:58:28.630 --> 00:58:31.243
the city center and make it up
the hill to the Pynx,

00:58:31.243 --> 00:58:34.111
because they were so busy
talking that they just wouldn't

00:58:34.111 --> 00:58:37.439
get going.
So, the officials had some guys

00:58:37.439 --> 00:58:40.329
carrying a rope dipped in red
dye.

00:58:40.329 --> 00:58:43.825
They circle the agora,
and they kept closing the

00:58:43.825 --> 00:58:48.189
circle until everybody was out.
You would be running from them

00:58:48.189 --> 00:58:51.180
in the first place,
because you wouldn't want to

00:58:51.180 --> 00:58:54.554
get your coat full of red dye,
and so that's what he's

00:58:54.554 --> 00:58:56.400
referring to.
He said,

00:58:56.400 --> 00:58:59.494
"even the presidents of the
assembly have not arrived,

00:58:59.494 --> 00:59:02.593
they will be late,
and when they finally come they

00:59:02.593 --> 00:59:06.219
will push and fight each other
for a seat in the front row,

00:59:06.219 --> 00:59:09.760
streaming down altogether,
you can't imagine how.

00:59:09.760 --> 00:59:13.436
But they will say nothing about
making peace,

00:59:13.436 --> 00:59:16.944
oh my Athens,
I am always the first to make

00:59:16.944 --> 00:59:21.539
the return voyage to the
assembly and take my seat.

00:59:21.539 --> 00:59:25.734
Since I am alone,
I groan, I yawn,

00:59:25.734 --> 00:59:31.580
I stretch my legs,
I fart, I don't know what to

00:59:31.580 --> 00:59:34.635
do,
I write, I pull out my loose

00:59:34.635 --> 00:59:38.889
hairs, I add up my accounts,
looking off at my fields,

00:59:38.889 --> 00:59:41.976
longing for peace,
hating the town,

00:59:41.976 --> 00:59:45.969
sick for my village home which
never said,

00:59:45.969 --> 00:59:48.442
buy my charcoal,
my vinegar, my oil,

00:59:48.442 --> 00:59:52.539
the word buy is unknown there
where everything is free."

00:59:52.539 --> 00:59:56.904
"So, I have come here fully
prepared to shout,

00:59:56.904 --> 01:00:00.289
to interrupt,
to abuse the speakers,

01:00:00.289 --> 01:00:04.258
if they talk about anything but
peace, but here come these

01:00:04.258 --> 01:00:07.309
noon-time presidents.
Didn't I tell you?

01:00:07.309 --> 01:00:09.840
Didn't I predict how they would
come?

01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:12.550
Everyone jostling up to the
front seat.

01:00:12.550 --> 01:00:16.148
Next, the herald of the
assembly says,

01:00:16.148 --> 01:00:20.719
move up, move up within the
consecrated area,

01:00:20.719 --> 01:00:24.359
and then he recites the formula
that regularly begins debate in

01:00:24.359 --> 01:00:27.070
the assembly.
He simply says,

01:00:27.070 --> 01:00:31.902
'Who wishes to speak?'"
At which somebody raises a hand

01:00:31.902 --> 01:00:35.231
and the game gets started.
Okay, that's the comic

01:00:35.231 --> 01:00:37.651
version;
but the real meanings on the

01:00:37.651 --> 01:00:41.401
Pynx were rarely comic.
They dealt with serious

01:00:41.401 --> 01:00:44.617
questions.
The assembly had four fixed

01:00:44.617 --> 01:00:49.376
meetings in each of the ten
periods, into which the official

01:00:49.376 --> 01:00:52.737
year was divided,
and also special additional

01:00:52.737 --> 01:00:55.389
meetings were called for when
necessary.

01:00:55.389 --> 01:00:59.992
Topics included the approval or
disapproval of treaties,

01:00:59.992 --> 01:01:03.901
making declarations of war,
assigning generals to

01:01:03.901 --> 01:01:07.853
campaigns, deciding what forces
and resources they should

01:01:07.853 --> 01:01:10.407
command,
confirming officials or

01:01:10.407 --> 01:01:14.813
removing them from office,
deciding whether or to not hold

01:01:14.813 --> 01:01:18.775
an ostracism,
questions concerning religion,

01:01:18.775 --> 01:01:23.500
questions of inheritance,
in fact, anything else that

01:01:23.500 --> 01:01:27.679
anybody wanted to bring up in
the assembly.

01:01:27.679 --> 01:01:30.783
It's especially amazing for
a citizen of a modern

01:01:30.783 --> 01:01:34.364
representative democracy to read
of these great town meetings

01:01:34.364 --> 01:01:37.886
dealing directly with questions
of foreign policy that could

01:01:37.886 --> 01:01:41.288
mean life or death for those
present at the debate and for

01:01:41.288 --> 01:01:44.309
their entire city.
To get some idea of the

01:01:44.309 --> 01:01:47.184
distance between ancient and
modern democracy,

01:01:47.184 --> 01:01:50.059
we need only to consider how an
emergency,

01:01:50.059 --> 01:01:54.093
say the seizure of an American
embassy, would be dealt with

01:01:54.093 --> 01:01:58.183
today in the United States.
It probably arrived first as

01:01:58.183 --> 01:02:02.404
secret information at some
bureau of the government's vast

01:02:02.404 --> 01:02:05.070
and complex intelligence
service,

01:02:05.070 --> 01:02:08.688
although it could also just
show up on CNN before the

01:02:08.688 --> 01:02:11.698
government knows.
But it would be treated as

01:02:11.698 --> 01:02:15.528
highly confidential and revealed
only to a few people in the

01:02:15.528 --> 01:02:18.840
White House, the state,
and defense departments.

01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:23.214
Policy would be discussed
in a small closed group and the

01:02:23.214 --> 01:02:27.297
decision made by one man
ultimately, the President of the

01:02:27.297 --> 01:02:30.736
United States.
If there were no leaks,

01:02:30.736 --> 01:02:36.190
a big if, people would hear of
it only when the die had been

01:02:36.190 --> 01:02:39.015
cast.
A model for those of my vintage

01:02:39.015 --> 01:02:42.647
was the Cuban Missile Crisis,
which was kept as a great

01:02:42.647 --> 01:02:44.694
secret.
In those days the press

01:02:44.694 --> 01:02:48.519
actually would keep secrets on
behalf of the national security.

01:02:48.519 --> 01:02:50.440
Can you imagine such an old
fashioned approach?

01:02:53.489 --> 01:02:56.816
Then they had been kicking it
around for a week when the

01:02:56.816 --> 01:03:00.565
President got on television and
told us what the menace was and

01:03:00.565 --> 01:03:03.730
what he was doing about it.
It was too late to have any

01:03:03.730 --> 01:03:06.550
discussion or argument about,
but that's the way it works in

01:03:06.550 --> 01:03:09.525
our system.
Questions of war and peace

01:03:09.525 --> 01:03:14.444
rose more than once in Periclean
Athens and each time the popular

01:03:14.444 --> 01:03:18.625
assembly had a full debate,
and made the decision by

01:03:18.625 --> 01:03:23.550
raising their hands in a vote
determined by a simple majority.

01:03:23.550 --> 01:03:26.745
I don't think there's any
stronger evidence of the full

01:03:26.745 --> 01:03:30.000
and final sovereignty of the
Athenian people on the most

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:33.432
important questions than the
fact that that is the way they

01:03:33.432 --> 01:03:37.011
made those decisions.
An assembly of thousands of

01:03:37.011 --> 01:03:40.460
course could not do its business
without help.

01:03:40.460 --> 01:03:44.430
For that it relied on the
council of five hundred chosen

01:03:44.430 --> 01:03:47.030
by lot from all Athenian
citizens.

01:03:47.030 --> 01:03:50.923
Although it performed many
public functions that the larger

01:03:50.923 --> 01:03:53.340
body could not handle
efficiently,

01:03:53.340 --> 01:03:57.726
its main responsibility was to
prepare legislation for

01:03:57.726 --> 01:04:01.558
consideration by the people.
In this respect,

01:04:01.558 --> 01:04:05.521
as in all others,
the council was the servant of

01:04:05.521 --> 01:04:08.564
the assembly.
The assembly could vote

01:04:08.564 --> 01:04:12.204
down a bill drafted by the
council, they could change it on

01:04:12.204 --> 01:04:15.033
the floor,
they could send it back with

01:04:15.033 --> 01:04:19.132
instructions for redrafting,
or they could replace it with

01:04:19.132 --> 01:04:23.752
an entirely different bill.
Full sovereignty and a real

01:04:23.752 --> 01:04:28.495
exercise of public authority
rested directly with the

01:04:28.495 --> 01:04:31.380
assembly.
Almost no constitutional

01:04:31.380 --> 01:04:34.664
barrier prevented a majority of
the citizens,

01:04:34.664 --> 01:04:39.364
assembled on the Pynx,
on a particular day from doing

01:04:39.364 --> 01:04:43.700
anything they wanted to do.
Turning to the executive,

01:04:43.700 --> 01:04:46.849
as what we would call the
executive, these distinctions

01:04:46.849 --> 01:04:50.127
did not exist for the Athenians.
They didn't make these

01:04:50.127 --> 01:04:53.163
divisions, but to help us
understand it I'm using these

01:04:53.163 --> 01:04:55.510
terms.
What we might call the

01:04:55.510 --> 01:05:00.112
executive was severely limited
in extent, in discretion,

01:05:00.112 --> 01:05:02.922
and power.
The distinction between

01:05:02.922 --> 01:05:06.817
legislative and judicial
authority was far less clear

01:05:06.817 --> 01:05:09.951
than in our own society.
To begin with,

01:05:09.951 --> 01:05:13.208
there was no president,
no prime minister,

01:05:13.208 --> 01:05:16.266
no cabinet;
there was not any elected

01:05:16.266 --> 01:05:20.471
official responsible for the
management of the state in

01:05:20.471 --> 01:05:24.909
general for formulating or
proposing a general policy.

01:05:24.909 --> 01:05:28.263
Nothing that Americans would
call an administration or that

01:05:28.263 --> 01:05:30.460
the British would call a
government.

01:05:30.460 --> 01:05:34.553
The chief elected officials
were ten generals,

01:05:34.553 --> 01:05:38.842
voted for a one year term.
As their title indicated,

01:05:38.842 --> 01:05:42.208
they were basically military
officials, who commanded the

01:05:42.208 --> 01:05:45.812
army and the navy.
They could be reelected without

01:05:45.812 --> 01:05:50.574
limit and extraordinary men like
Cimon and Pericles were elected

01:05:50.574 --> 01:05:54.579
almost every year,
but they were very exceptional.

01:05:54.579 --> 01:05:58.829
The political power such men
exercised was limited to their

01:05:58.829 --> 01:06:02.932
personal ability to persuade
their fellow citizens in the

01:06:02.932 --> 01:06:07.396
assembly to follow their advice.
They had no special political

01:06:07.396 --> 01:06:10.230
or civil authority,
and except on military and

01:06:10.230 --> 01:06:13.001
naval campaigns,
they couldn't give orders to

01:06:13.001 --> 01:06:15.988
anybody.
Even in military matters the

01:06:15.988 --> 01:06:19.550
powers of the generals were
severely limited.

01:06:19.550 --> 01:06:24.597
Leaders of expeditions were
selected by vote of the full

01:06:24.597 --> 01:06:29.002
Athenian assembly,
which also determined the size

01:06:29.002 --> 01:06:33.500
of the force and what goals it
should pursue.

01:06:33.500 --> 01:06:37.118
Before the generals took office
they were subjected to a

01:06:37.118 --> 01:06:41.460
scrutiny of their qualifications
by the council of five hundred.

01:06:41.460 --> 01:06:46.098
After completing their year
of service, their performance on

01:06:46.098 --> 01:06:50.516
the job, and especially their
financial accounts were subject

01:06:50.516 --> 01:06:54.639
to audit in a special process
called euthuna.

01:06:54.639 --> 01:06:58.438
Nor was this the only control
by the people over the few

01:06:58.438 --> 01:07:02.879
officials chosen by election.
Ten times a year the popular

01:07:02.879 --> 01:07:07.723
assembly voted to determine
whether the general's conduct of

01:07:07.723 --> 01:07:11.090
military affairs appears
satisfactory,

01:07:11.090 --> 01:07:15.209
and if the people vote against
someone's confirmation in

01:07:15.209 --> 01:07:17.980
office, he is tried in a law
court.

01:07:17.980 --> 01:07:21.989
If he is found guilty they
assess his punishment or fine.

01:07:21.989 --> 01:07:25.230
If he is acquitted,
he resumes office.

01:07:25.230 --> 01:07:30.086
Since elected office conferred
prestige, elected officials were

01:07:30.086 --> 01:07:33.611
carefully controlled,
rather, lest they should

01:07:33.611 --> 01:07:36.510
undermine the rule of the
people.

01:07:36.510 --> 01:07:39.861
That's what's behind all of
this careful check on the

01:07:39.861 --> 01:07:42.573
generals.
Even with these severe

01:07:42.573 --> 01:07:47.125
controls, the Athenians
fulfilled only a few public

01:07:47.125 --> 01:07:50.864
offices by election.
Choosing their military

01:07:50.864 --> 01:07:54.439
officials, their naval
architects, and only some of

01:07:54.439 --> 01:07:58.061
their treasurers,
as well as the superintendent

01:07:58.061 --> 01:08:01.159
of the city water supply in that
manner;

01:08:01.159 --> 01:08:05.037
all other officials,
and there were a good number of

01:08:05.037 --> 01:08:08.427
them, were chosen by lot.
Allotment was the

01:08:08.427 --> 01:08:11.931
characteristic device by which
the Athenians chose their

01:08:11.931 --> 01:08:14.958
officials,
in accordance with the dominant

01:08:14.958 --> 01:08:17.794
democratic principle,
which was equality,

01:08:17.794 --> 01:08:22.119
which held that any citizen who
is capable of performing civil

01:08:22.119 --> 01:08:26.430
responsibilities well enough,
and it's corollary that feared

01:08:26.430 --> 01:08:29.535
allowing executive or
administrative power to fall

01:08:29.535 --> 01:08:32.957
into the hands of a few men,
even those who were

01:08:32.957 --> 01:08:35.949
experienced, or had special
abilities.

01:08:35.949 --> 01:08:39.944
For these reasons,
the Athenians filled the bulk

01:08:39.944 --> 01:08:44.789
of their offices by lot and
limited tenure to one term per

01:08:44.789 --> 01:08:50.060
man in each office except for
the council of five hundred,

01:08:50.060 --> 01:08:54.829
where a man could serve twice
in the course of his life.

01:08:54.829 --> 01:08:58.227
Generals, however,
could be reelected forever,

01:08:58.227 --> 01:09:02.909
because it was so obvious that
issues of skill and ability were

01:09:02.909 --> 01:09:07.062
literally vital in that job and
so that was the one real

01:09:07.062 --> 01:09:11.140
exception to being limited to a
very short term.

01:09:11.140 --> 01:09:14.336
To a degree that is amazing to
the modern mind,

01:09:14.336 --> 01:09:18.019
the Athenians kept the
management of their public life

01:09:18.019 --> 01:09:20.659
in the hands of ordinary
citizens,

01:09:20.659 --> 01:09:24.640
away from professors,
professionals,

01:09:24.640 --> 01:09:29.189
experts, bureaucrats,
and politicians.

01:09:29.189 --> 01:09:34.000
I'll pick up the rest of the
story next time.

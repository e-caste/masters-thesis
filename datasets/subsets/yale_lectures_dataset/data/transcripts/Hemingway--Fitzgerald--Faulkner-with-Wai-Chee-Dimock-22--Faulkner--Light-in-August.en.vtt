WAI CHEE DIMACK: OK.

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:07.667
So we're starting on our
final novel and I'm

00:00:07.667 --> 00:00:09.967
very glad its Faulkner.

00:00:09.967 --> 00:00:13.367
There's so many stories to
tell about Faulkner, just

00:00:13.367 --> 00:00:16.733
about the composition
of the novel.

00:00:16.733 --> 00:00:20.000
So this started out having
a different title.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.200
It started out being
called Dark House.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.100
So you can see that it really is
right on the other side of

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.467
the spectrum.

00:00:27.467 --> 00:00:29.467
And it's a really an interesting
thing that actually

00:00:29.467 --> 00:00:33.933
this novel could be described
as either Dark House

00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:37.867
or Light in August. So really,
light and dark obviously are

00:00:37.867 --> 00:00:40.600
have the two constitutive
parts of the novel, even

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.700
though it's the light that has
been highlighted in the

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.833
present title.

00:00:45.833 --> 00:00:49.000
In fact, it could just as
well have been dark.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.600
This is what Faulkner says about
the title that we now

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:59.767
have, Light in August. This is
much later when he was talking

00:00:59.767 --> 00:01:05.767
about it at the University
of Virginia in 1957.

00:01:05.767 --> 00:01:09.967
"In August, in Mississippi
there's a few days somewhere

00:01:09.967 --> 00:01:13.367
about the middle of the month
when actually there's a

00:01:13.367 --> 00:01:14.700
foretaste of fall.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.867
It's cool, there's a lambence,
a luminous quality to the

00:01:18.867 --> 00:01:24.433
light, as though it came not
from today, but from back in

00:01:24.433 --> 00:01:27.167
the old classic times.

00:01:27.167 --> 00:01:31.333
It might have fauns and satyrs
and the gods from Greece.

00:01:31.333 --> 00:01:34.533
And that's all that
the title meant.

00:01:34.533 --> 00:01:38.833
It was just to me a pleasant,
evocative title, because it

00:01:38.833 --> 00:01:44.133
reminded me of that time of the
luminosity older than our

00:01:44.133 --> 00:01:46.800
Christian civilization.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.867
Maybe the connection is with
Lena Grove, who has something

00:01:50.867 --> 00:01:52.700
of that pagan quality."

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.933
This a great entry point
to the novel.

00:01:57.933 --> 00:02:00.867
It's about quality of light
in Mississippi.

00:02:00.867 --> 00:02:05.033
So it has this very important,
local dimension to it.

00:02:05.033 --> 00:02:10.933
But it also sees itself as
completely looking back to an

00:02:10.933 --> 00:02:15.033
extremely long literary
tradition, going back to the

00:02:15.033 --> 00:02:16.900
classic times.

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.567
And in fact, it predates
Christianity.

00:02:19.567 --> 00:02:22.800
So that's very important to
consider this, that while

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.367
Christianity is very, very
important in this novel, but

00:02:26.367 --> 00:02:28.600
it's very important to remember
that Faulkner

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.800
actually also has a reference
point that is older than

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.267
Christianity.

00:02:33.267 --> 00:02:35.100
So because Faulkner was talking

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.600
about fauns and satyrs.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.267
I think that those words are
just words to most of us, so I

00:02:40.267 --> 00:02:42.933
just found some illustrations.

00:02:42.933 --> 00:02:47.267
This is from the Roman
mosaics, the satyr.

00:02:47.267 --> 00:02:53.133
So you see basically it's like
human beings, except, the feet

00:02:53.133 --> 00:02:55.367
are the hooves of a goat.

00:02:55.367 --> 00:03:00.800
So this is not a very pretty
image of the faun.

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.967
I think that in our minds, we
tend to think of the faun as

00:03:04.967 --> 00:03:09.667
very delicate and graceful, but
actually it has kind of an

00:03:09.667 --> 00:03:12.067
animalistic dimension to it.

00:03:12.067 --> 00:03:17.000
And this is probably looking
more like our stereotypical

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.333
image of the faun, very
graceful, but nonetheless with

00:03:20.333 --> 00:03:22.467
the hooves of a goat.

00:03:22.467 --> 00:03:27.033
So in As I Lay Dying, we
talked a lot about the

00:03:27.033 --> 00:03:30.067
relation between animals
and humans.

00:03:30.067 --> 00:03:32.700
So it's very important to keep
that in mind as well, just in

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.333
the reference to the faun.

00:03:36.333 --> 00:03:41.933
Faulkner is invoking that whole
uncertain boundary, and

00:03:41.933 --> 00:03:46.967
certain in betweenness between
human and animal.

00:03:46.967 --> 00:03:50.867
And the satyr actually has
an even long history.

00:03:50.867 --> 00:03:53.600
The faun basically is Roman.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.967
Satyr, it goes back to
the fifth century BC.

00:03:56.967 --> 00:03:59.000
Basically it's Greek.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.200
And there's a whole genre called
the satyr comedies,

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.567
featuring this creature.

00:04:05.567 --> 00:04:10.333
It's again, looking for most
part like a human being, but

00:04:10.333 --> 00:04:17.033
having the tail of a horse, and
also the ears of a donkey.

00:04:17.033 --> 00:04:21.400
Just to see the way in which
the satyr has been

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.867
reactivated, and picked
up and reincarnated in

00:04:24.867 --> 00:04:26.300
the twentieth century.

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.233
Here is someone with the
years of a satyr.

00:04:30.233 --> 00:04:34.067
We call them Vulcan's ears, but
looking exactly like the

00:04:34.067 --> 00:04:36.433
ears of a satyr.

00:04:36.433 --> 00:04:39.167
And here is another image,
basically the ears are the

00:04:39.167 --> 00:04:40.867
giveaway of this creature.

00:04:40.867 --> 00:04:45.700
Also it's small, not very noble
looking compared to a

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:48.567
human being, or to a god.

00:04:48.567 --> 00:04:52.000
So but Faulkner, even though
he's interested in the satyr

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.200
and fauns, he's not really
writing about them.

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:59.233
He's mostly interested in Lena
and the fact that she is a

00:04:59.233 --> 00:05:01.833
pagan character to him.

00:05:01.833 --> 00:05:04.033
So the more on Lena.

00:05:04.033 --> 00:05:08.133
"She was never ashamed of that
child whether it had any

00:05:08.133 --> 00:05:12.967
father or not, she was simply
going to the conventional laws

00:05:12.967 --> 00:05:13.833
at the time...

00:05:13.833 --> 00:05:16.000
and find its father.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.467
But as far as she was concerned,
she didn't

00:05:18.467 --> 00:05:22.133
especially need any father
for it anymore

00:05:22.133 --> 00:05:23.567
than the women that--

00:05:23.567 --> 00:05:28.767
on whom Jupiter begot children
were anxious for home and a

00:05:28.767 --> 00:05:29.567
father."

00:05:29.567 --> 00:05:34.833
So Faulkner seems to be really
interested in women who get

00:05:34.833 --> 00:05:36.833
pregnant out of wedlock.

00:05:36.833 --> 00:05:44.400
We've seen this in As I Lay
Dying, in Dewey Dell, and the

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.433
way in which that is the
constant burden on her mind.

00:05:48.433 --> 00:05:50.700
And it seems that now
he has gone to the

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:52.967
other side of the spectrum.

00:05:52.967 --> 00:05:58.000
If pregnancy was a constant
burden on Dewey Dell's mind,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.933
here it appears that it
is not a burden at

00:06:02.933 --> 00:06:05.200
all on Lena's mind.

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:07.867
And maybe that's why
she's a pagan.

00:06:07.867 --> 00:06:11.933
It's that it's completely OK to
be pregnant out of wedlock,

00:06:11.933 --> 00:06:16.833
not to have a father, not to
have a wedded father as the

00:06:16.833 --> 00:06:18.867
father of your child.

00:06:18.867 --> 00:06:22.667
And the reason that is this case
is that Jupiter has had

00:06:22.667 --> 00:06:28.733
this long history of having
fathered many children who can

00:06:28.733 --> 00:06:30.567
point to Jupiter
as the father--

00:06:30.567 --> 00:06:32.100
Jupiter or Zeus--

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:34.633
as the father, but otherwise
not having a human father.

00:06:34.633 --> 00:06:38.900
So it's a completely honorable
thing to have a baby when you

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:41.333
don't know who the father is.

00:06:41.333 --> 00:06:46.767
And the most famous example of
course is someone called Leda.

00:06:46.767 --> 00:06:48.567
So you guys know--

00:06:48.567 --> 00:06:52.900
picking two very chaste
illustrations of Leda and the

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:56.767
swan, Tht swan being
Zeus, obviously.

00:06:56.767 --> 00:06:59.933
But if you would just go and
look it up, you can find

00:06:59.933 --> 00:07:01.800
numerous other illustrations--

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:03.400
some not so chaste--

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:04.900
showing Leda and the swan.

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:07.400
And this is the most
famous example.

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:10.133
Leda was married to someone
else, and Zeus was just

00:07:10.133 --> 00:07:11.133
enamored of her.

00:07:11.133 --> 00:07:15.000
So he comes to her in
the form of a swan.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.933
And the offspring, one of the
most famous offspring from

00:07:18.933 --> 00:07:21.267
that union, was Helen.

00:07:21.267 --> 00:07:25.367
So basically the whole of The
Iliad, the whole of The

00:07:25.367 --> 00:07:31.033
Odyssey really comes from this
union between Leda and Zeus.

00:07:31.033 --> 00:07:34.500
And there would have been no
epic at all if there had not

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:37.867
been this union between
Leda and someone

00:07:37.867 --> 00:07:39.967
who's not quite human.

00:07:39.967 --> 00:07:41.367
So here's another
illustration.

00:07:41.367 --> 00:07:45.867
This one is Greek and this one
is Roman, once again Roman

00:07:45.867 --> 00:07:50.367
mosaic, and many modern
incarnations as well.

00:07:50.367 --> 00:07:53.000
Yeats also has a poem
about Leda.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.700
So basically someone who goes
down in history as--

00:08:00.333 --> 00:08:02.667
even though it's not presented
in this is way, but she's

00:08:02.667 --> 00:08:06.400
really going down in history as
the most honorable instance

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:10.767
of pregnancy outside wedlock.

00:08:10.767 --> 00:08:15.500
But Faulkner is also not
writing Leda's story.

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:18.167
He's writing Lena's story.

00:08:18.167 --> 00:08:23.733
So this is very much a case of
the American Lena's updating

00:08:23.733 --> 00:08:29.500
the Greek Leda, even though
maybe she doesn't know the

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:32.833
father, or maybe she's not
sure that she can get the

00:08:32.833 --> 00:08:36.733
legitimate wedded husband to
be the father of the child.

00:08:36.733 --> 00:08:38.800
She's definitely going
to go and she's

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:39.967
going to get someone.

00:08:39.967 --> 00:08:44.167
So, "It was her destiny to have
a husband and children

00:08:44.167 --> 00:08:47.867
and she knew it, and so she went
out and attended to it."

00:08:47.867 --> 00:08:49.333
Completely matter of fact.

00:08:49.333 --> 00:08:52.567
This is the American case,
it's not the old

00:08:52.567 --> 00:08:54.000
classic times anymore.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.133
In twentieth century America,
you need to find a guy.

00:08:57.133 --> 00:09:03.933
So she's on the road to find
this guy, whom she still

00:09:03.933 --> 00:09:07.367
thinks ought to be the
actual father.

00:09:07.367 --> 00:09:13.667
So today's lecture is really
about the updating of the old

00:09:13.667 --> 00:09:16.167
classic unwed mother.

00:09:16.167 --> 00:09:19.767
And this is the structure of
today's lecture, the way that

00:09:19.767 --> 00:09:21.600
I've been talking about it,
obviously you know that this

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:24.300
is going to be a comedy
on the part of Lena.

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:27.567
So it's comedy and essentially
sex as comic.

00:09:27.567 --> 00:09:32.433
But because this is a road
novel, one of many, it also

00:09:32.433 --> 00:09:35.333
has an epic dimension to it.

00:09:35.333 --> 00:09:39.667
And another innovation that
Faulkner is bringing to bear

00:09:39.667 --> 00:09:45.767
on the novel and that really is
a serious updating of the

00:09:45.767 --> 00:09:48.433
classic epic comedy --

00:09:48.433 --> 00:09:51.300
is the introduction
of two allegorical

00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:54.000
names, Byron and Burden.

00:09:56.667 --> 00:10:00.900
I want to go back still, just
linger with the classics for a

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:04.600
moment in defining comedy
in a particular way.

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:07.800
Usually we just in think of
comedy as like a Jane Austen.

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:10.833
That would be comedy, it
has a happy ending.

00:10:10.833 --> 00:10:15.600
But actually in the Poetics,
Aristotle defines comedy in a

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:18.633
slightly different way that
actually is closer to the way

00:10:18.633 --> 00:10:22.600
that I would like to talk about
comedy in this class.

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:26.133
In the Poetics he says, "The
participants in comedy were

00:10:26.133 --> 00:10:31.000
called komoidoi not from their
being revelers, but because

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.267
they wander from one
village to another.

00:10:35.267 --> 00:10:37.267
So wandering, on the road.

00:10:37.267 --> 00:10:43.600
Persons who are inferior, not
however going all the way to

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:49.233
full villainy, but imitating
the ugly of which the

00:10:49.233 --> 00:10:51.567
ludicrous is one part.

00:10:51.567 --> 00:10:57.067
The ludicrous that is, is the
failing or a piece of ugliness

00:10:57.067 --> 00:11:00.133
which causes no pain
or destruction."

00:11:00.133 --> 00:11:02.233
So this is a very
counter-intuitive

00:11:02.233 --> 00:11:04.267
definition of comedy.

00:11:04.267 --> 00:11:07.367
A lot of it is not that nice.

00:11:07.367 --> 00:11:11.333
It has to do with villainous
people, but not going all the

00:11:11.333 --> 00:11:13.800
way to full villain.

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:17.633
Ugly people, but again, not
going all the way so they're

00:11:17.633 --> 00:11:18.500
utterly despicable.

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:21.600
It has a lot to do with people
who are not noble.

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:25.267
And that really is the classic
definition of comedy.

00:11:25.267 --> 00:11:29.800
The emphasis really lands on the
happy ending, that on the

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:35.367
fact that they are low born,
that they are low in another

00:11:35.367 --> 00:11:41.400
way, that they don't rise to the
tragic height of nobility,

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:47.567
which is the elevation
proper to tragedy.

00:11:47.567 --> 00:11:51.433
Comedy is of a much
lower elevation.

00:11:51.433 --> 00:11:54.967
So they are sometimes ludicrous,
they are basically

00:11:54.967 --> 00:11:56.967
not admirable people.

00:11:56.967 --> 00:12:04.233
But one result of not being
completely admirable is that

00:12:04.233 --> 00:12:06.533
they actually survive
quite well.

00:12:06.533 --> 00:12:12.000
They actually manage
to hang in there.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.833
So they bring no pain or
destruction either to

00:12:16.833 --> 00:12:19.100
themselves, or to
other people.

00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:21.600
Don't forget, this is the exact
opposite of tragedy.

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:25.400
We have mass destruction at
the end of tragedy --

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:28.967
if you think about the tragedy
of Troy, or the tragedies

00:12:28.967 --> 00:12:31.400
based on the story of Troy
-- mass destruction.

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:35.467
Here a comedy suggests that
everyone is going to be able

00:12:35.467 --> 00:12:36.833
to survive.

00:12:36.833 --> 00:12:43.000
So with that definition in mind,
let's think about the

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:48.200
ways in which Lena is pagan,
especially in relation to her

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:52.767
sexuality, and way that Faulkner
represents this

00:12:52.767 --> 00:12:56.500
aspect of the human condition.

00:12:56.500 --> 00:13:00.333
This is the story of how
Lena gets pregnant.

00:13:00.333 --> 00:13:03.633
"She slept in a leanto room
at the back of house.

00:13:03.633 --> 00:13:06.600
It had a window, which she
learned to open and close

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:09.833
again in the dark, without
making noise.

00:13:09.833 --> 00:13:13.000
She had lived there eight years
before she opened the

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.033
window for the first time.

00:13:15.033 --> 00:13:18.567
She had not opened it a dozen
times hardly before she

00:13:18.567 --> 00:13:21.433
discovered that she should not
have opened it at all.

00:13:21.433 --> 00:13:24.300
She said to herself, that's
just my luck.

00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:27.733
Two weeks later, she climbed
again through the window.

00:13:27.733 --> 00:13:30.333
It was a little difficult
this time.

00:13:30.333 --> 00:13:33.233
If it had been this hard to do
before, I reckon I would not

00:13:33.233 --> 00:13:35.067
be doing it now, she thought."

00:13:35.067 --> 00:13:39.733
So the entire story what could
have been seen as tragic,

00:13:39.733 --> 00:13:44.467
traumatic, devastation in
person's life, one whose

00:13:44.467 --> 00:13:48.300
life's been ruined, all that
is told through Lena's

00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:52.133
relation to the window, that she
can open it without making

00:13:52.133 --> 00:13:54.833
a noise, that's she's done it
a few times, and then she

00:13:54.833 --> 00:13:57.500
realized she shouldn't have done
it, and then the final

00:13:57.500 --> 00:13:59.567
time it's very hard.

00:13:59.567 --> 00:14:03.100
But she wished that it had been
that hard to begin with.

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:10.067
So it's all told through this
completely off focus off

00:14:10.067 --> 00:14:13.267
center relation to
the main event.

00:14:13.267 --> 00:14:18.667
And it doesn't seem especially
bad, really, even though it's

00:14:18.667 --> 00:14:20.567
a matter of inconvenience.

00:14:20.567 --> 00:14:24.267
And that really is what the
pregnancy is to Lena.

00:14:24.267 --> 00:14:26.500
It is a matter of
inconvenience.

00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:29.867
It is a nuisance, that it is not
so easy for her to get out

00:14:29.867 --> 00:14:32.167
the window at this time.

00:14:32.167 --> 00:14:36.967
And just to remind us that
Faulkner doesn't always write

00:14:36.967 --> 00:14:40.833
about sexuality in this way,
let's just go back to a

00:14:40.833 --> 00:14:44.333
character who is completely
non-pagan.

00:14:44.333 --> 00:14:52.033
And there's no more striking
example than Quentin in The

00:14:52.033 --> 00:14:53.667
Sound and the Fury.

00:14:53.667 --> 00:14:56.700
So this is what he thinks
about women's sexuality.

00:14:56.700 --> 00:15:00.567
"Delicate equilibrium of
periodic filth between two

00:15:00.567 --> 00:15:02.067
moons balanced.

00:15:02.067 --> 00:15:04.433
Moons he said full and
yellow as harvest

00:15:04.433 --> 00:15:06.167
moons her hips thighs...

00:15:06.167 --> 00:15:10.467
Liquid putrefaction like drowned
things floating like

00:15:10.467 --> 00:15:14.267
pale rubber, flabbily filled
getting in odor of honeysuckle

00:15:14.267 --> 00:15:15.733
all mixed up."

00:15:15.733 --> 00:15:23.000
So for Quentin and indeed for
most non-pagan characters,

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.033
there's a good part of the world
that is repugnant, that

00:15:26.033 --> 00:15:29.200
is just really repulsive.

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:34.167
And it turns out that women's
sexuality is part of that very

00:15:34.167 --> 00:15:37.000
repugnant world.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.700
So it's not great to live
in a world like that.

00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:44.567
And that's really why Quentin
does what he does.

00:15:44.567 --> 00:15:49.333
For someone like Lena who is
pagan, much of the world, in

00:15:49.333 --> 00:15:53.367
fact probably all the world
is not repugnant.

00:15:53.367 --> 00:15:56.300
It's inconvenient, sometimes
it's a little ugly, it's a

00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:58.667
little messy, but it's
not repugnant.

00:15:58.667 --> 00:16:02.400
And that's why she
is what she is.

00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:06.133
So this is one way we can
think about Lena.

00:16:06.133 --> 00:16:09.367
And I should tell you that she's
not the only character.

00:16:09.367 --> 00:16:13.200
So this novel is actually not
that comic, but her share of

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:17.033
the novel is comic
in that way.

00:16:17.033 --> 00:16:23.133
But even though Aristotle
defines comedy as basically

00:16:23.133 --> 00:16:28.733
the journey that is undertaken
by ignoble persons, the more

00:16:28.733 --> 00:16:32.333
recognizable model obviously
is the epic journey.

00:16:32.333 --> 00:16:35.433
So any time we think of someone
traveling on the road,

00:16:35.433 --> 00:16:37.500
we think of the epic genre.

00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:39.067
And that is very much in play.

00:16:39.067 --> 00:16:41.700
We've seen it in play elsewhere
in Faulkner.

00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:44.600
It's very much in play
here as well.

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:47.833
And this actually a kind
of not so funny--

00:16:47.833 --> 00:16:51.167
It's interesting to see what
the tone of this is, of the

00:16:51.167 --> 00:16:54.033
description of Lena
being on the road.

00:16:54.033 --> 00:16:58.267
"Though the mules plod in
a steady and unflagging

00:16:58.267 --> 00:17:02.433
hypnosis, the vehicle does
not seem to progress...

00:17:02.433 --> 00:17:06.967
like a shabby bead upon the
mile red string of road.

00:17:06.967 --> 00:17:10.633
So much so is this that in the
watching of it the eyes loses

00:17:10.633 --> 00:17:14.933
it as sight and sense drowsily
merge and blend, like the rode

00:17:14.933 --> 00:17:19.500
itself, with all the peaceful
and monotonous changes between

00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:24.400
darkness and day, like already
measured thread being rewound

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:25.867
onto a spool.

00:17:25.867 --> 00:17:29.633
So that at last, as though
out of some trivial and

00:17:29.633 --> 00:17:34.033
unimportant region beyond even
distance, the sound of it

00:17:34.033 --> 00:17:38.300
seems to come slow and terrific
and without meaning,

00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:42.300
as though it were a ghost
traveling a half mile ahead of

00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:43.633
its own shape."

00:17:43.633 --> 00:17:46.033
Great description.

00:17:46.033 --> 00:17:49.067
And it's on a different
register.

00:17:49.067 --> 00:17:51.867
We can see that it's really on
a different tonal register

00:17:51.867 --> 00:17:55.633
from Lena having trouble
climbing out the window.

00:17:55.633 --> 00:18:00.933
And I would say that there's a
complicated relation between

00:18:00.933 --> 00:18:05.033
the epic genre and the comic
genre in this novel.

00:18:05.033 --> 00:18:10.633
On the whole, what the epic
genre brings to this novel is

00:18:10.633 --> 00:18:15.867
the sense of a journey that
somebody has to go on.

00:18:15.867 --> 00:18:20.767
It's not even especially
pleasurable.

00:18:20.767 --> 00:18:23.833
It just stretches on.

00:18:23.833 --> 00:18:27.700
Yesterday listening more in
terms of paradigms that we've

00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:29.067
been using.

00:18:29.067 --> 00:18:32.167
Tomorrow is going to be exactly
like today, and going

00:18:32.167 --> 00:18:34.467
to be exactly like yesterday.

00:18:34.467 --> 00:18:40.133
It's the repetition of the same
that defines this kind of

00:18:40.133 --> 00:18:41.467
epic journey.

00:18:41.467 --> 00:18:44.400
So it is peaceful
and monotonous.

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:48.467
And the image that Faulkner
uses is that it's like an

00:18:48.467 --> 00:18:53.633
already measured thread being
rewound onto a spool.

00:18:53.633 --> 00:18:56.800
There's absolutely nothing
new under the sun.

00:18:56.800 --> 00:19:03.933
It is just an old story being
told over and over again, and

00:19:03.933 --> 00:19:10.367
the complete exclusion of
anything that is dramatic from

00:19:10.367 --> 00:19:12.100
this sense of the journey.

00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:15.833
So in many ways it's very hard
to write a novel based on the

00:19:15.833 --> 00:19:17.333
fact that it's completely
monotonous.

00:19:17.333 --> 00:19:18.867
And that's part the challenge.

00:19:18.867 --> 00:19:21.933
Although I promise you, the rest
of the novel actually is

00:19:21.933 --> 00:19:23.433
anything but monotonous.

00:19:23.433 --> 00:19:28.900
But Lena's part of it actually
aspires to be monotonous in a

00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:29.900
good sense.

00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:32.033
In a sense that there's
really--

00:19:32.033 --> 00:19:32.967
It's good.

00:19:32.967 --> 00:19:34.833
There's no dramatic
development.

00:19:34.833 --> 00:19:36.433
There's no catastrophe.

00:19:36.433 --> 00:19:39.333
That's really what Faulkner has
at the back of his head,

00:19:39.333 --> 00:19:42.967
is that catastrophe is
what defines tragedy.

00:19:42.967 --> 00:19:46.367
Non-catastrophe is what
defines comedy.

00:19:46.367 --> 00:19:51.867
So just to give you a sense of
the way in which this epic

00:19:51.867 --> 00:19:56.033
journey is being incarnated and
reincarnated in American

00:19:56.033 --> 00:19:56.667
literature.

00:19:56.667 --> 00:20:01.000
Two other very famous novels,
Jack Kerouac's On the Road,

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:05.200
and more recently this
apocalyptic instance of that,

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:08.433
Cormac McCarthy, The Road.

00:20:08.433 --> 00:20:11.867
Faulkner's On the
Road is a little

00:20:11.867 --> 00:20:13.667
different from those two.

00:20:13.667 --> 00:20:17.633
So today we'll think all the
ingredients that go into his

00:20:17.633 --> 00:20:20.467
making of his road novel.

00:20:20.467 --> 00:20:24.767
It has to do with kindness of
strangers, it has to do

00:20:24.767 --> 00:20:30.200
something like switchability; if
the journey is going to be

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:33.233
pretty monotonous for
Lena, there's

00:20:33.233 --> 00:20:35.200
got to be some variation.

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:37.233
It has to alternate with
something else.

00:20:37.233 --> 00:20:40.900
So it turns out that actually
even though the protagonist

00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:44.833
herself too is peaceful for
this story to be very

00:20:44.833 --> 00:20:48.467
dramatic, there will be other
people, the supporting cast

00:20:48.467 --> 00:20:50.200
actually, who supplies
the drama.

00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:53.600
So there's kind of a
switchability between when the

00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:56.333
action or where the drama
is going to come from.

00:20:56.333 --> 00:20:58.733
As far as Lena's concerned, the
drama's going to come from

00:20:58.733 --> 00:21:02.567
the supporting cast, rather
than from Lena herself.

00:21:02.567 --> 00:21:06.167
And this further switchability
in terms of the relation

00:21:06.167 --> 00:21:07.967
between the weighty
and the mundane.

00:21:07.967 --> 00:21:09.667
And then I'll talk about
gerunds as well.

00:21:09.667 --> 00:21:12.800
So there's the outline
of what is to come.

00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:16.167
But let's just stay with the
kindness of strangers for a

00:21:16.167 --> 00:21:17.367
little bit.

00:21:17.367 --> 00:21:19.767
Lena has come quite far.

00:21:19.767 --> 00:21:25.367
And the reason that the journey
is so peaceful and

00:21:25.367 --> 00:21:29.833
monotonous is that there's an
endless supply of people who

00:21:29.833 --> 00:21:34.267
would do things for her, who
will be the supplies of

00:21:34.267 --> 00:21:38.367
hospitality to keep
Lena going.

00:21:38.367 --> 00:21:39.900
And that's who is very Greek.

00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:45.367
We know that hospitality is
one of the key virtues in

00:21:45.367 --> 00:21:46.567
Greek culture.

00:21:46.567 --> 00:21:50.100
When a stranger comes, you're
supposed to feed them, shelter

00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:52.933
them, give them presents
when they go away.

00:21:52.933 --> 00:21:57.000
That is the understanding, the
basic mode of exchange between

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.900
human beings, is that you're
good to people you are seeing

00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:03.300
for the first time, and that
you never see again.

00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:06.533
So the quality, there's
something of that in a way

00:22:06.533 --> 00:22:08.733
that Lena is being treated.

00:22:08.733 --> 00:22:14.700
"The evocation of far is the
peaceful corridor paved with

00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:19.167
unflagging and tranquil faith
and peopled with kind and

00:22:19.167 --> 00:22:22.033
nameless faces and voices.

00:22:22.033 --> 00:22:23.133
Lucas Burch.

00:22:23.133 --> 00:22:23.700
I don't know.

00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:26.633
I don't know of anybody by
that name around here.

00:22:26.633 --> 00:22:27.267
This road?

00:22:27.267 --> 00:22:28.967
It goes to Pocahontas.

00:22:28.967 --> 00:22:29.767
He might be there.

00:22:29.767 --> 00:22:30.767
It's possible.

00:22:30.767 --> 00:22:32.933
Here's a wagon that's going
a piece of the way.

00:22:32.933 --> 00:22:34.733
It will take you that far."

00:22:34.733 --> 00:22:38.267
So these people are completely
faceless and nameless.

00:22:38.267 --> 00:22:40.933
They really are complete
strangers.

00:22:40.933 --> 00:22:43.567
They are not meant to be
remembered or to be

00:22:43.567 --> 00:22:47.033
encountered again, even though
Faulkner sometimes actually

00:22:47.033 --> 00:22:49.367
picks up some of them
in his other novels.

00:22:49.367 --> 00:22:53.167
But they're meant to recede into
the background as part of

00:22:53.167 --> 00:22:57.567
that peaceful and monotonous
corridor, which it is

00:22:57.567 --> 00:23:02.000
completely safe for
Lena to travel.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.033
So it's the sense of guaranteed
safety due to the

00:23:06.033 --> 00:23:10.233
guaranteed hospitality
of strangers.

00:23:10.233 --> 00:23:16.833
But we know that the kindness of
strangers has got to take a

00:23:16.833 --> 00:23:21.600
dramatic turn for there to be
a good story to the novel.

00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:24.833
So we're actually seeing
it very soon.

00:23:24.833 --> 00:23:30.367
And it comes about
through Lena's

00:23:30.367 --> 00:23:32.233
interaction with a couple.

00:23:32.233 --> 00:23:35.833
She's been taken in
by this couple.

00:23:35.833 --> 00:23:40.800
And it turns out that the
arrival of Lena creates a

00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:44.900
major upheaval in the life
of this married couple.

00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:48.633
So all of the sudden, Lena
recedes into the background.

00:23:48.633 --> 00:23:51.967
So we can add to switchability,
the

00:23:51.967 --> 00:23:54.900
switchability between foreground
and background.

00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:59.000
Lena recedes into the background
as the supporting

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.300
cast comes to the foreground.

00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:05.100
so this is the exchange
between the Armstids.

00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:07.867
"He cannot tell from
her voice if she's

00:24:07.867 --> 00:24:09.800
watching him or not now.

00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:13.367
He towels himself with
a split floursack.

00:24:13.367 --> 00:24:14.800
Maybe she will.

00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:18.000
If it's running away from her
he's after, I reckon he's

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.967
going to find out he made a bad
mistake when he stopped

00:24:21.967 --> 00:24:25.467
before he put the Mississippi
River between them.

00:24:25.467 --> 00:24:29.733
And now he knows that she is
watching him, the gray woman

00:24:29.733 --> 00:24:34.900
not plump and not thin, manhard,
workhard, in a

00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:39.667
serviceable gray garment worn
savage and brusque, her hands

00:24:39.667 --> 00:24:43.200
on her hips, her face like those
of generals who have

00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:46.400
been defeated in battle.

00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:48.000
You men, she says.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.200
What do you want
to do about it?

00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:49.900
Turn her out?

00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:51.467
Let her sleep in
the barn maybe?

00:24:51.467 --> 00:24:52.867
You men, she says.

00:24:52.867 --> 00:24:55.600
You durn men."

00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:57.967
So this is all we're
going to--

00:24:57.967 --> 00:25:00.800
I mean, we'll get one more,
a little bit more of this.

00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:05.033
But this is really as far as
Faulkner is concerned, this is

00:25:05.033 --> 00:25:07.767
completely adequate
freestanding

00:25:07.767 --> 00:25:10.900
snapshot of the marriage.

00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:14.533
And I would say that it is as
interesting as the marriage

00:25:14.533 --> 00:25:22.133
between Cora and her husband,
Tull, except that it is at the

00:25:22.133 --> 00:25:24.233
moment a tension between
the two.

00:25:24.233 --> 00:25:27.067
So we know that what kind of
people these are, they are the

00:25:27.067 --> 00:25:32.733
poor white, more people who
can't afford a towel and use a

00:25:32.733 --> 00:25:36.167
split floursack for a towel.

00:25:36.167 --> 00:25:42.267
And the way that they actually
know each other very well.

00:25:42.267 --> 00:25:52.967
So Armstid doesn't have to look
usually, to see if she's

00:25:52.967 --> 00:25:55.067
watching him or not.

00:25:55.067 --> 00:25:59.700
It really says a lot about what
kind of a relationship it

00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:03.433
is, that you can just tell by
the tone of voice whether or

00:26:03.433 --> 00:26:05.400
not the person's
looking at you.

00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:11.867
So that for me is a measure of
how good the marriage is, that

00:26:11.867 --> 00:26:14.067
you know your companion
that well.

00:26:14.067 --> 00:26:16.567
Just a tone of voice will be
able to tell you exactly the

00:26:16.567 --> 00:26:20.800
posture, the physical posture
of this person.

00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:24.600
So initially we can't really
tell, but then once he said

00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:28.367
something, once he said, hey
this guy is not going to be

00:26:28.367 --> 00:26:32.100
able to escape from Lena, once
he said that then she knew

00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:36.633
instantly that she's
looking at him.

00:26:36.633 --> 00:26:44.367
And we know what she looks like,
sort of a more stern

00:26:44.367 --> 00:26:50.033
version, I think, of Addie, but
very much belonging to the

00:26:50.033 --> 00:26:57.633
same socioeconomic group, in
a gray garment, working

00:26:57.633 --> 00:26:58.800
hard all her life.

00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:03.267
But also not just workhard and
all these interesting coined

00:27:03.267 --> 00:27:06.233
adjectives, coined
by Faulkner.

00:27:06.233 --> 00:27:07.133
Manhard--

00:27:07.133 --> 00:27:09.367
I don't exactly know
what that means.

00:27:09.367 --> 00:27:10.367
Manhard.

00:27:10.367 --> 00:27:12.367
Maybe she is completely
resistant to

00:27:12.367 --> 00:27:13.900
the charms of men.

00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:17.500
Maybe that's one definition of
what it means to be manhard.

00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:19.867
Certainly, she's worked
hard all her life.

00:27:19.867 --> 00:27:22.900
And maybe the two adjectives
are related in that way.

00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:26.867
There's a way in which if you
work so hard all your life

00:27:26.867 --> 00:27:28.900
you're kind of immune to
the charms of other

00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:31.233
people, men and women.

00:27:31.233 --> 00:27:37.533
So she is immune to the charms
of her husband, and her face

00:27:37.533 --> 00:27:41.600
is like the face of
generals who've

00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:44.467
been defeated in battle.

00:27:44.467 --> 00:27:48.333
It is a weird reference.

00:27:48.333 --> 00:27:52.767
The Civil War is really not
important in this--

00:27:52.767 --> 00:27:53.600
Well no actually.

00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:55.433
The Civil War is very, very
important to another

00:27:55.433 --> 00:27:58.900
character, but it's not
important to Lena.

00:27:58.900 --> 00:28:01.233
The Civil War is front and
center for another character,

00:28:01.233 --> 00:28:05.767
but it oddly intrudes into this
moment when it really is

00:28:05.767 --> 00:28:08.333
not the reference point.

00:28:08.333 --> 00:28:13.567
But the entire history of the
South is indexed in this

00:28:13.567 --> 00:28:17.033
reference of Mrs. Armstid's
face looking

00:28:17.033 --> 00:28:19.133
like the face of generals.

00:28:19.133 --> 00:28:26.433
So in many ways, she's more like
a man than like a woman.

00:28:26.433 --> 00:28:29.467
I know there's actually
that --

00:28:29.467 --> 00:28:33.267
when I came to this sections
last week and I enjoyed them

00:28:33.267 --> 00:28:36.067
very much, some of you mentioned
that Nicole is

00:28:36.067 --> 00:28:39.733
financially more like a man
and so is Rosemary.

00:28:39.733 --> 00:28:42.433
Rosemary is financially
more like a man.

00:28:42.433 --> 00:28:45.700
So Fitzgerald has also thought
about the ways in which there

00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:48.567
could be a cross-gender dynamics
in people who are

00:28:48.567 --> 00:28:51.100
otherwise completely feminine.

00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:55.200
And here she doesn't look
especially feminine, and the

00:28:55.200 --> 00:29:00.533
cross-gender dynamics are much,
much more powerful here.

00:29:00.533 --> 00:29:04.333
So she's like a general who's
been defeated in battle.

00:29:04.333 --> 00:29:07.700
So maybe she's been defeated
in life, just because it's

00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:13.800
been such a hard life, or just
that it didn't go exactly the

00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:15.300
way she wanted.

00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:20.033
We don't know the contents of
that phrase, that why her face

00:29:20.033 --> 00:29:23.767
is like the face of generals
who have been defeated.

00:29:23.767 --> 00:29:26.067
We also don't know, but that's
the least of it.

00:29:26.067 --> 00:29:30.833
We don't know why she's suddenly
saying what she's

00:29:30.833 --> 00:29:35.267
saying to her husband.
"You durn men."

00:29:35.267 --> 00:29:38.333
Armstid's really not
contemplating having

00:29:38.333 --> 00:29:40.500
an affair with Lena.

00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:43.167
So the durn men is not really a

00:29:43.167 --> 00:29:46.933
complaint against her husband.

00:29:46.933 --> 00:29:53.167
It is a grievance that is
probably directed against the

00:29:53.167 --> 00:29:59.200
entire half of the human
population, men, that this is

00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:04.400
what men would do to women,
and her husband, being an

00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:05.400
instance of that.

00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:08.567
Although, obviously there are
many other episodes in the

00:30:08.567 --> 00:30:11.900
marriage that might be in
the back of her mind.

00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:15.367
But in any case, this completely
out of the blue,

00:30:15.367 --> 00:30:21.733
out of context, outburst from
Mrs. Armstid suggests that

00:30:21.733 --> 00:30:25.433
this is both a very good
marriage, but also a

00:30:25.433 --> 00:30:28.900
complicated marriages as all
marriages would have to that

00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:30.733
have lasted for a long time.

00:30:30.733 --> 00:30:35.467
So these two people know
each other very well.

00:30:35.467 --> 00:30:38.800
And he seems to know, he knows
better than we do exactly what

00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:44.167
is going on in her mind when
she says, "You durn men."

00:30:44.167 --> 00:30:48.100
And then there's a further
development to this episode.

00:30:52.233 --> 00:30:55.667
Now we're getting dramatic
action from Mrs. Armstid.

00:30:55.667 --> 00:30:59.400
"What are you fixing to do with
your eggmoney this time

00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:00.533
of night, he says.

00:31:00.533 --> 00:31:03.400
I reckon it's mine to
do with what I like.

00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:07.000
She stoops into a lamp, her
face hushed, bitter.

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:08.967
God knows it was me
who sweated over

00:31:08.967 --> 00:31:10.200
them and nursed them.

00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:11.933
You never lifted no hand.

00:31:11.933 --> 00:31:13.133
Sho, he says.

00:31:13.133 --> 00:31:16.067
I reckon it ain't any human in
this country is going to

00:31:16.067 --> 00:31:19.433
dispute them hens with you,
lessen it's the possum and the

00:31:19.433 --> 00:31:21.767
snakes, that rooster bank,
neither, he says.

00:31:21.767 --> 00:31:25.800
Because, stooping suddenly,
she jerks off one shoe the

00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:29.533
strikes the china bank a
single shattering blow.

00:31:29.533 --> 00:31:33.433
From the bed, reclining, Armstid
watches her gather the

00:31:33.433 --> 00:31:38.567
remaining coins from among the
china fragments and drop them

00:31:38.567 --> 00:31:43.367
with the others into the sack
and knot it and reknot it

00:31:43.367 --> 00:31:48.700
three or four times with
savage finality."

00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:53.067
This is one of the most
satisfying representations of

00:31:53.067 --> 00:31:56.233
almsgiving, or people being
charitable, and looking

00:31:56.233 --> 00:31:59.467
completely not charitable
when they're doing it.

00:31:59.467 --> 00:32:04.700
So this is the only way this
woman will allow herself to be

00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:12.267
charitable is by looking as
harsh and bitter as she could.

00:32:12.267 --> 00:32:16.767
So before that, answer
her thought.

00:32:16.767 --> 00:32:21.833
Well maybe she's just in kind
of a jealous mood and she's

00:32:21.833 --> 00:32:24.433
not going to allow Lena
to stay in the house.

00:32:24.433 --> 00:32:28.233
But it turns out that it's
quite the opposite.

00:32:28.233 --> 00:32:34.133
And it probably was a kind of
a complex combination of

00:32:34.133 --> 00:32:36.767
recognizing that, yes this
is a young woman, very

00:32:36.767 --> 00:32:40.133
attractive, that she's not
that young woman, very

00:32:40.133 --> 00:32:41.433
attractive.

00:32:41.433 --> 00:32:50.000
But recognizing maybe in some
sense that this woman is

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:55.867
embodying a long nursed
grievance that she has against

00:32:55.867 --> 00:32:56.800
men in general.

00:32:56.800 --> 00:33:05.467
Whatever is the psychology,
she is in solidarity with

00:33:05.467 --> 00:33:12.333
Lena, without ever wanting to
betray that solidarity.

00:33:12.333 --> 00:33:16.867
So it is that complicated kind
of behavior that you want to

00:33:16.867 --> 00:33:20.333
do something for that person,
but you never want to give

00:33:20.333 --> 00:33:23.400
yourself away as doing
something.

00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:30.400
So it really is the most
interesting and dramatic and

00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:33.967
psychologically and behaviorally
complicated kind

00:33:33.967 --> 00:33:38.667
of kindness of strangers, is
that it's not, definitely not,

00:33:38.667 --> 00:33:42.067
the traditional kind
of almsgiving.

00:33:42.067 --> 00:33:45.700
So in terms of the narrative
dynamics, we can say that the

00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:49.967
Armstids have completely taken
over the narrative.

00:33:49.967 --> 00:33:54.500
There's a complete switch
between Lena, the supposed

00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:58.567
protagonist, and the two of
them being the supporting

00:33:58.567 --> 00:34:02.967
cast. It turns out that
the supporting cast --

00:34:02.967 --> 00:34:07.267
that Faulkner probably spends
more time thinking about the

00:34:07.267 --> 00:34:10.933
supporting cast, than he
does thinking about the

00:34:10.933 --> 00:34:11.567
protagonist.

00:34:11.567 --> 00:34:14.233
And that is a really interesting
way to define the

00:34:14.233 --> 00:34:17.833
protagonist, is that maybe a
protagonist is someone you can

00:34:17.833 --> 00:34:21.667
actually afford not to spend a
lot of time thinking about.

00:34:21.667 --> 00:34:25.567
And that it is really the
supporting cast that you have

00:34:25.567 --> 00:34:27.133
to give your energy to.

00:34:27.133 --> 00:34:31.133
It's a very interesting
definition of reversibility,

00:34:31.133 --> 00:34:35.033
of the distribution of space,
distribution of attention

00:34:35.033 --> 00:34:37.033
within the story.

00:34:37.033 --> 00:34:39.033
And we're seeing many
instances of this.

00:34:39.033 --> 00:34:43.233
So because we've just done with
Fitzgerald, just wanted

00:34:43.233 --> 00:34:46.800
to remind you of a very
obvious instance of

00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:51.433
switchability in Tender Is the
Night, in the description of

00:34:51.433 --> 00:34:56.467
Nicole, that her brown back is
hanging from the pearls.

00:34:56.467 --> 00:35:00.867
The human body is hanging from
the appendage, a completely

00:35:00.867 --> 00:35:06.867
switched, reversed degree of
importance between the person

00:35:06.867 --> 00:35:10.133
who's supposedly the protagonist
and that what is

00:35:10.133 --> 00:35:12.033
supposed to be just
an appendage.

00:35:12.033 --> 00:35:14.933
And of course that switchability
is played out

00:35:14.933 --> 00:35:18.767
not only in terms of that one
particular detail, but also in

00:35:18.767 --> 00:35:21.700
terms of the entire narrative
of Tender Is the Night.

00:35:21.700 --> 00:35:25.533
It turns out that Dick Diver
is completely upstaged by

00:35:25.533 --> 00:35:31.333
Nicole as she becomes really the
main actor in the novel.

00:35:31.333 --> 00:35:34.600
That is has becomes her story,
that she gets to dictate the

00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:36.200
outcome of that story.

00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:40.867
And he becomes her appendage,
dispensable appendage at the

00:35:40.867 --> 00:35:41.800
end of the novel

00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:45.133
So we're seeing this
in Faulkner.

00:35:45.133 --> 00:35:48.967
Basically on a very large macro
scale, in terms of the

00:35:48.967 --> 00:35:52.500
entire narrative structure
of Tender Is the Night.

00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:54.500
In Faulkner, it is
much more local.

00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:57.867
It is just this one moment
that there's this switch

00:35:57.867 --> 00:36:03.233
relation between protagonist
and supporting cast. But it

00:36:03.233 --> 00:36:09.900
also plays out on different
registers in Light in August.

00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:13.633
So we'll look at one other
also local instance of

00:36:13.633 --> 00:36:14.900
switchability.

00:36:18.167 --> 00:36:22.100
If the Armstids represent the
dramatic arm of the novel,

00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:25.200
where Faulkner can give us
high, human psychological

00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:31.867
drama, when it comes to Lena,
what he gives us is kind of

00:36:31.867 --> 00:36:38.167
very small upheavals on what is
basically a level platform.

00:36:38.167 --> 00:36:41.867
But even on that very level
platform, they have mild

00:36:41.867 --> 00:36:45.367
upheavals, and it has to do with
the switchability between

00:36:45.367 --> 00:36:48.467
the weighty and the mundane.

00:36:48.467 --> 00:36:51.933
"So she seems to muse upon the
mounting road while the

00:36:51.933 --> 00:36:57.367
slowspitting and squatting men
watch her covertly, believing

00:36:57.367 --> 00:37:00.433
that she is thinking about the
man and the approaching

00:37:00.433 --> 00:37:05.767
crisis, when in reality she is
waging a mild battle with the

00:37:05.767 --> 00:37:10.733
providential caution of the old
earth of and with and by

00:37:10.733 --> 00:37:12.400
which she lives.

00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:14.367
This time she conquers.

00:37:14.367 --> 00:37:18.467
She rises and walking a little
awkwardly, a little carefully,

00:37:18.467 --> 00:37:22.967
she traverses the ranked battery
of maneyes and enters

00:37:22.967 --> 00:37:25.400
the store, the clerk
following.

00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:28.267
I'm a-going to do it, she
thinks, even while ordering

00:37:28.267 --> 00:37:29.667
the cheese and crackers.

00:37:29.667 --> 00:37:32.033
"I'm a-going to do
it, saying aloud.

00:37:32.033 --> 00:37:33.467
And a box of sardines.

00:37:33.467 --> 00:37:35.533
She calls them sour-deens.

00:37:35.533 --> 00:37:37.333
And a nickle box."

00:37:37.333 --> 00:37:44.733
So this is the essence of the
drama in the to be or not to

00:37:44.733 --> 00:37:47.667
be, or in this case to
do or not to do.

00:37:47.667 --> 00:37:52.800
The to do or not to do in Lena's
consciousness revolves

00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:55.600
around a box of sardines.

00:37:55.600 --> 00:38:00.133
And that is completely
OK for Faulkner.

00:38:00.133 --> 00:38:05.533
It qualifies her to be the
protagonist of his novel.

00:38:05.533 --> 00:38:10.167
So we really have to give some
thought to what it is that

00:38:10.167 --> 00:38:14.700
entitles a person to be the
protagonist of a novel.

00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:18.267
We know that in Greek tragedy,
a person has to be noble and

00:38:18.267 --> 00:38:23.200
to have a very drastic downfall
in order to qualify

00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:26.000
to be the hero of a tragedy.

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:29.633
In the modern comic novel,
nothing like that.

00:38:29.633 --> 00:38:33.967
Just a very, very minor
upheaval is OK.

00:38:33.967 --> 00:38:39.467
So I think that it is because
of that very level platform,

00:38:39.467 --> 00:38:48.300
because of that basic, very
reliable continuum that is

00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:51.933
backed up, supported, by the
kindness of strangers, it's

00:38:51.933 --> 00:38:55.433
because of that continuum that
we get a really interesting

00:38:55.433 --> 00:38:58.733
linguistic practice, and a
kind of a stylistic tick

00:38:58.733 --> 00:39:03.233
almost in this particular
novel.

00:39:03.233 --> 00:39:05.633
We've seen a little bit of that
in the other novels, but

00:39:05.633 --> 00:39:08.133
this novel it's really
pronounced.

00:39:08.133 --> 00:39:11.733
It has to do with the use of
gerunds, especially turning

00:39:11.733 --> 00:39:14.133
verbs into nouns.

00:39:14.133 --> 00:39:16.467
We've seen a little bit of that
earlier in the passage,

00:39:16.467 --> 00:39:19.733
but here it becomes
in the foreground.

00:39:19.733 --> 00:39:23.800
"That far within my hearing
before my seeing...

00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:27.600
I will be riding within the
hearing of Lucas Burch before

00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:28.433
his seeing.

00:39:28.433 --> 00:39:31.700
He will hear the wagon,
but he won't know.

00:39:31.700 --> 00:39:36.033
So there will be one within his
hearing before his seeing.

00:39:36.033 --> 00:39:38.700
And then he will see me and
he will be excited.

00:39:38.700 --> 00:39:42.067
And so there will be two within
his seeing before his

00:39:42.067 --> 00:39:43.400
remembering."

00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:45.100
Highly stylized.

00:39:45.100 --> 00:39:49.233
Basically, there's no way we can
not notice the fact that

00:39:49.233 --> 00:39:53.400
the verbs are being used as
nouns in this instance.

00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:59.433
So the way that we can maybe try
to make sense of this very

00:39:59.433 --> 00:40:02.967
self conscious practice on
Faulkner's part, is by

00:40:02.967 --> 00:40:08.200
noticing how different an image
of Lucas Burch we're

00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:09.567
getting from Lena.

00:40:09.567 --> 00:40:12.900
How different from the image
that we've getting just a

00:40:12.900 --> 00:40:13.867
moment ago.

00:40:13.867 --> 00:40:17.533
No, actually just a moment
later from Armstid.

00:40:17.533 --> 00:40:20.433
Armstid knows exactly
what Lucas is doing.

00:40:20.433 --> 00:40:22.467
He's running away from her.

00:40:22.467 --> 00:40:25.100
He's just really unlucky that he
hasn't put the Mississippi

00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:28.033
River in between himself
and this woman.

00:40:28.033 --> 00:40:33.267
So Armstid has a completely
accurate diagnosis and

00:40:33.267 --> 00:40:37.333
portrait of what kind of
a man Lucas Burch is.

00:40:37.333 --> 00:40:42.600
Lena has a completely
unrealistic, out of touch with

00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:45.733
reality portrait of Lucas.

00:40:45.733 --> 00:40:49.167
She things that he'll be very
glad to see her and he'll be

00:40:49.167 --> 00:40:51.300
excited that in fact it's
not just one person

00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:53.967
who's coming, but two.

00:40:53.967 --> 00:40:58.233
And so in many ways what
Faulkner is giving us in this

00:40:58.233 --> 00:41:02.167
very stylized, linguistic
practice, is to create a kind

00:41:02.167 --> 00:41:09.967
of linguistic cocoon around
Lena, that she is insulated by

00:41:09.967 --> 00:41:14.400
this unidiomatic use of
English, just as she's

00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:20.000
insulated by an interpretation
of reality that really has

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:23.567
very little to do with the
reality which is the truth

00:41:23.567 --> 00:41:25.267
about Lucas Burch.

00:41:25.267 --> 00:41:30.467
It is very much a kind of
linguistic shelter, in which

00:41:30.467 --> 00:41:35.067
she can afford to keep on
thinking in this way about the

00:41:35.067 --> 00:41:37.533
man who keeps running
away from her.

00:41:37.533 --> 00:41:42.967
And this is why she can afford
and why can she be continued

00:41:42.967 --> 00:41:51.167
to be completely unworried,
unanxious about her pregnancy.

00:41:51.167 --> 00:41:54.900
This is how she can do avoid,
she can prevent that from

00:41:54.900 --> 00:41:57.300
becoming a burden on her.

00:41:57.300 --> 00:42:03.667
So we can think of this as one
element, Faulkner is very

00:42:03.667 --> 00:42:07.867
artistic, intervening to make
certain things possible for

00:42:07.867 --> 00:42:10.633
one character that would not
be possible for other

00:42:10.633 --> 00:42:11.100
characters.

00:42:11.100 --> 00:42:13.900
And this particular
intervention, the use of

00:42:13.900 --> 00:42:18.967
gerunds, is one stylistic device
to make sure that Lena

00:42:18.967 --> 00:42:21.833
is preserved in a state of
constant well-being.

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:29.233
But he's also clear-eyed enough
to know that she really

00:42:29.233 --> 00:42:34.133
is completely dead wrong
about Lucas Burch.

00:42:34.133 --> 00:42:35.000
Sorry.

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:38.400
Fast forwarding to a
much later moment.

00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:42.733
But this is just to bring
Faulkner into a discussion

00:42:42.733 --> 00:42:45.433
that we've been having all
through the semester which is

00:42:45.433 --> 00:42:51.000
about types, where certain
people, characters, can be

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:55.300
classified, they belong to
broader groups, groups that

00:42:55.300 --> 00:42:57.033
have labels.

00:42:57.033 --> 00:43:00.400
So it turns out that he's also
quite conscious of the fact

00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:05.833
that Lucas Burch actually is not
so much an individual as a

00:43:05.833 --> 00:43:08.667
type, a type of man.

00:43:08.667 --> 00:43:12.900
And this is his commentary--

00:43:12.900 --> 00:43:15.467
This is actually Hightower's
commentary, but it's as good

00:43:15.467 --> 00:43:17.067
as Faulkner's--

00:43:17.067 --> 00:43:20.433
commentary on the fate
of Lena Grove.

00:43:20.433 --> 00:43:23.400
"For the Lena Groves,
there are always

00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:25.433
two men in the world.

00:43:25.433 --> 00:43:28.300
And the number is legion.

00:43:28.300 --> 00:43:32.400
Lucas Burches and Byron
Bunches." There's all of them

00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:34.333
are suddenly appearing
in the plural.

00:43:34.333 --> 00:43:37.367
So Lena Grove is a type.

00:43:37.367 --> 00:43:39.833
They have the Lena Groves
of the world.

00:43:39.833 --> 00:43:43.967
And then there's the Lucas
Burches and Byron Bunches.

00:43:43.967 --> 00:43:48.133
And this is really what saves
Lena, is that she actually is

00:43:48.133 --> 00:43:50.533
one of the Lena Groves.

00:43:50.533 --> 00:43:55.467
And her fate is to be unlucky
in one sense, in that she's

00:43:55.467 --> 00:43:58.367
stuck with a man like
Lucas Burch.

00:43:58.367 --> 00:44:02.333
But she's lucky in a sense
that you can just know.

00:44:02.333 --> 00:44:05.400
It's almost kind of a
statistical point, that to

00:44:05.400 --> 00:44:10.533
every Lucas Burch, there will be
a Byron Bunch who will take

00:44:10.533 --> 00:44:11.667
care of her.

00:44:11.667 --> 00:44:14.767
So she was saved in this way
that there always will be the

00:44:14.767 --> 00:44:19.000
pairing of two kinds
of men in her life.

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:25.333
So here is the allegory thick
and fast, definitely very

00:44:25.333 --> 00:44:27.733
heavy handed and meant
to be noticed.

00:44:27.733 --> 00:44:34.800
Byron, Lord Byron, the
stereotypical romantic poet.

00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:38.400
And with the added little
joke, I think, that he

00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:41.900
actually died in Missolonghi,
Italy.

00:44:41.900 --> 00:44:44.800
So it has some reference,
some affinity to

00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:46.233
Mississippi, as well.

00:44:46.233 --> 00:44:48.767
And I'm sure that it is not
beyond Faulkner to think that

00:44:48.767 --> 00:44:50.667
that's a nice connection.

00:44:50.667 --> 00:44:59.700
So here's Byron being the
namesake for Byron Bunch.

00:44:59.700 --> 00:45:05.167
And sure enough, he lives
up to his namesake, the

00:45:05.167 --> 00:45:07.600
romanticism of his namesake.

00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:09.467
"Then Byron fell in love.

00:45:09.467 --> 00:45:13.267
He fell in love contrary to
all the tradition of his

00:45:13.267 --> 00:45:16.600
austere and jealous country
raising, which demands in the

00:45:16.600 --> 00:45:19.267
object physical inviolability.

00:45:19.267 --> 00:45:22.333
It happens on a Saturday
afternoon while he's

00:45:22.333 --> 00:45:24.033
alone at the mill.

00:45:24.033 --> 00:45:28.467
Two miles away the house is
still burning, the yellow

00:45:28.467 --> 00:45:32.733
smoke standing straight as a
monument on the horizon.

00:45:32.733 --> 00:45:36.167
They saw it before noon, when
the smoke first rose above the

00:45:36.167 --> 00:45:40.733
trees, before the whistle blew
and the others departed.

00:45:40.733 --> 00:45:44.067
I reckon Byron'll quit
too today, they said.

00:45:44.067 --> 00:45:49.167
With a free fire to watch."

00:45:49.167 --> 00:45:53.600
This switchability is in
high gear in here.

00:45:53.600 --> 00:46:00.233
It starts out with Byron falling
in love, but that

00:46:00.233 --> 00:46:05.567
romantic side of this story
doesn't even get to control

00:46:05.567 --> 00:46:08.233
the entire paragraph.

00:46:08.233 --> 00:46:12.467
Basically it just gets
two sentences.

00:46:12.467 --> 00:46:16.500
And then the rest of the
paragraph is taken over by

00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:20.800
something that has nothing
to do with romantic love.

00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:25.333
And all of a sudden we realize
that yes, Byron is falling in

00:46:25.333 --> 00:46:30.067
love at the same time
as a very--

00:46:30.067 --> 00:46:32.667
that's dramatic enough
in his life.

00:46:32.667 --> 00:46:38.600
But this drama in Byron's life
is taking part with a drama

00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:41.333
that's going to overtake the
entire town, which is the

00:46:41.333 --> 00:46:44.067
burning of a house.

00:46:44.067 --> 00:46:45.800
And it says something --

00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:48.400
and we're also getting another
glimpse of what kind of people

00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:53.533
are living in this town in
the reference to the

00:46:53.533 --> 00:46:55.000
free fire to watch.

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:59.567
This is not the strangers who
are kind to other strangers.

00:46:59.567 --> 00:47:03.000
It's a very different portrait
of the local community.

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:07.967
So it turns out that Byron is
not the only person who has an

00:47:07.967 --> 00:47:11.100
allegorical name, but a young
character who does as well.

00:47:11.100 --> 00:47:13.767
"It's a big fire, another
said, what can it be?

00:47:13.767 --> 00:47:17.000
I don't remember anything coming
out that way big enough

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:20.600
to make all that smoke except
the Burden house.

00:47:20.600 --> 00:47:22.467
Maybe that's what it
is, another said.

00:47:22.467 --> 00:47:27.633
"My pappy says he can remember
how 50 years ago folks said it

00:47:27.633 --> 00:47:32.500
ought to burned, and with a
little human fat meant to

00:47:32.500 --> 00:47:34.067
start it good.

00:47:34.067 --> 00:47:37.867
Maybe your pappy slipped it out
there and set it afire, a

00:47:37.867 --> 00:47:38.433
third said.

00:47:38.433 --> 00:47:39.233
They laughed."

00:47:39.233 --> 00:47:42.433
So this is the others
allegorical name, that Byron's

00:47:42.433 --> 00:47:47.400
always going to be paired with
someone whose name is Burden.

00:47:47.400 --> 00:47:51.167
And Burden is not as--

00:47:51.167 --> 00:47:55.167
There's no Byron
to clue us in.

00:47:55.167 --> 00:47:59.833
There's actually a very famous
poem that will suggest to us

00:47:59.833 --> 00:48:03.000
the origins of that name,
Kipling's poem, "White Man's

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:07.000
Burden." "Take up the white
man's burden / and reap his

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:13.667
old reward: / The blame of those
ye better, / the hate of

00:48:13.667 --> 00:48:14.933
those ye guard."

00:48:14.933 --> 00:48:18.267
I think we have a completely
misguided, wrongheaded notion

00:48:18.267 --> 00:48:20.133
actually of Kipling's
White Man's Burden.

00:48:20.133 --> 00:48:24.633
It's not really about how great
it is to take up the

00:48:24.633 --> 00:48:28.333
white man's burden, but how
awful it is and that you incur

00:48:28.333 --> 00:48:31.567
the hatred of lots of people.

00:48:31.567 --> 00:48:38.033
So this is one of the
allegorical names, how they

00:48:38.033 --> 00:48:41.133
function in Light in August
and how Faulkner's really

00:48:41.133 --> 00:48:46.633
updating the old classic story,
is that it really is

00:48:46.633 --> 00:48:51.500
the story about the fate of
someone called Byron and the

00:48:51.500 --> 00:48:53.533
fate of someone called Burden.

00:48:53.533 --> 00:48:58.133
And obviously there are other
characters who are invoked

00:48:58.133 --> 00:49:02.533
through those two characters,
but they're both on fire.

00:49:02.533 --> 00:49:05.633
Byron is on fire because
he's falling in love.

00:49:05.633 --> 00:49:09.467
Joanna Burden actually is on
fire in that she's being

00:49:09.467 --> 00:49:10.533
burned alive.

00:49:10.533 --> 00:49:12.033
She's dead by that point.

00:49:12.033 --> 00:49:16.533
But she's on fire, her
body's on fire.

00:49:16.533 --> 00:49:22.633
So that is also what contributes
to the Light in August

00:49:22.633 --> 00:49:26.367
and that's why the other
alternative title, Dark

00:49:26.367 --> 00:49:28.467
House, is just as appropriate.

00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:04.086
Prof: Okay,
so we have the promise of the

00:00:04.086 --> 00:00:07.301
knowledge of everything,
at least everything within a

00:00:07.301 --> 00:00:10.171
certain category,
and we saw how we could see

00:00:10.171 --> 00:00:12.982
quantized energy last time,
and structure,

00:00:12.982 --> 00:00:19.629
and structure-related dynamics,
how nuclei vibrate and how it's

00:00:19.629 --> 00:00:23.680
different for heavier atoms.
 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.852
Today we're going to look again
at a different kind of dynamics,

00:00:27.852 --> 00:00:29.310
and also at bonding.
 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.410
So in the one-dimensional world
this is the payoff.

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.210
We have to go to the
three-dimensional world.

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.476
Okay, so you did problem sets
for today and you're now

00:00:40.476 --> 00:00:42.510
familiar with things like this.
 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:49.280
What do you know about the blue
curve and the red curve here?

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.122
Anybody got a suggestion of
what to do, or what they tell

00:00:53.122 --> 00:00:55.730
you about what the true solution
is?

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:56.500
Yes Angela?
 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.668
Student:  It looks like
the true solution is somewhere

00:00:58.668 --> 00:00:59.210
between them.
 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:00.039
Prof: I can't hear very
well.

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:01.881
Student:  It looks like
the true solution will be

00:01:01.881 --> 00:01:03.590
somewhere between them,
because it looks like --

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:05.111
Prof: Yes,
the true solution should be

00:01:05.111 --> 00:01:05.629
between them.
 

00:01:05.629 --> 00:01:11.099
The red one is too hot and the
blue one is too cold.

00:01:11.099 --> 00:01:11.640
Right?
 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.403
So there'll be,
in between them,

00:01:13.403 --> 00:01:16.702
there'll be one that'll just
come back down to the baseline

00:01:16.702 --> 00:01:17.840
for Hooke's law.
 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.245
Now the problem is that this
isn't Hooke's law,

00:01:21.245 --> 00:01:24.650
because I didn't show you the
whole picture.

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.060
It's in fact a double minimum.
 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.680
Right?
 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:34.519
And those are both true
solutions.

00:01:34.519 --> 00:01:37.459
So the correct
single minimum

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:40.120
energy would lie between those
two,

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.180
but for the double minimum
there's one,

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.673
there's a solution that's lower
in energy and a solution that's

00:01:46.673 --> 00:01:48.050
higher in energy.
 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:51.580
Now what would happen if we
moved the wells further apart?

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.940
Here you see the separation of
the two wells as 0.6 angstroms.

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:02.329
Suppose we moved it apart to be
1.3 angstroms.

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:03.040
Right?
 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.650
Now we have blue and red
solutions.

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.601
But now you notice the blue
solution (or the red solution,

00:02:09.601 --> 00:02:13.622
they're the same in the left),
they're both the same as the

00:02:13.622 --> 00:02:14.938
single minimum.
 

00:02:14.938 --> 00:02:18.189
So if you get the wells far
enough apart they look like

00:02:18.189 --> 00:02:21.259
single minima with respect to
their wavefunction.

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:23.580
Okay?
 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.340
Now, closer wells.
 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.250
If we move the wells closer
together, we get a lower minimum

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.099
energy than for the single well
solution.

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:34.758
Okay?
 

00:02:34.758 --> 00:02:38.770
And we get a higher energy for
the next higher one.

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.060
But they both look like the
single minimum --

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.150
but they both started when the
wells were far apart,

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.900
looking like the single minimum
solution,

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.889
one with no nodes,
one with one node.

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:53.274
When the wells were far apart
they had the same energy as the

00:02:53.274 --> 00:02:55.986
single minimum,
but when the wells come

00:02:55.986 --> 00:02:59.900
together, the one with no nodes
has less curvature,

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.816
less kinetic energy and is
lower energy than the single

00:03:02.816 --> 00:03:05.239
minimum,
and the other one has one node,

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:07.659
more curvature than the single
minimum,

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:10.526
and a higher energy;
that is to say,

00:03:10.526 --> 00:03:14.900
there's a splitting between the
energy of these two.

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.883
If the wells are far apart,
they're the same as the single

00:03:17.883 --> 00:03:19.320
minimum,
both of them,

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.038
the no-nodes and the one-node
solution,

00:03:22.038 --> 00:03:24.310
are the same as the single
minimum,

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.702
but if you bring them together
the no-nodes is lower in energy

00:03:28.702 --> 00:03:31.508
and the one-node is higher in
energy.

00:03:31.508 --> 00:03:36.607
So the energies split about the
original single minimum

00:03:36.607 --> 00:03:37.740
structure.
 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:42.139
Now that's really important
because that's what makes bonds.

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:43.150
Right?
 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:51.560
So if we have two atoms or
one-dimensional wells far apart,

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.800
say A and B,
and we get a solution in A and

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.985
a solution in B,
and if we want the solution for

00:03:58.985 --> 00:04:02.193
the whole thing,
we just put them together that

00:04:02.193 --> 00:04:04.348
way,
no nodes.

00:04:04.348 --> 00:04:08.026
Or we could flip B upside down,
multiply it by minus one,

00:04:08.026 --> 00:04:10.979
add them together then and we
get one node.

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:15.180
But they have the same energy
as the single ones would do.

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:16.040
Right?
 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:20.464
But if we bring them together
the energy gets lower,

00:04:20.464 --> 00:04:21.939
less curvature.
 

00:04:21.939 --> 00:04:22.528
Right?
 

00:04:22.528 --> 00:04:25.677
And that consists,
or gives rise,

00:04:25.677 --> 00:04:29.319
to a stabilization of the
particle.

00:04:29.319 --> 00:04:32.613
The particle is more stable
when the wells are closer

00:04:32.613 --> 00:04:33.310
together.
 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:34.430
Right?
 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:35.740
What would you call that?
 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:36.769
Student:  A bond.
 

00:04:36.769 --> 00:04:38.060
Prof: That's a bond.
 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.740
The energy is lower when
they're close together.

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.848
So that holds A and B together
because the energy of the

00:04:43.848 --> 00:04:46.899
particle is lower when the wells
are close together.

00:04:46.899 --> 00:04:48.810
So that's bonding.
 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:52.406
And part and parcel of this,
the flipside of this,

00:04:52.406 --> 00:04:54.901
is that you have this
wavefunction,

00:04:54.901 --> 00:04:56.370
which is higher.
 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:57.899
What will we call that?
 

00:04:57.899 --> 00:04:59.370
Student:  Antibonding.
 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:01.600
Prof: Antibonding.
 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.752
So you get a combination of
bonding and an antibonding

00:05:04.752 --> 00:05:08.322
combination because the kinetic
energy changes when the wells

00:05:08.322 --> 00:05:09.810
come closer together.
 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:14.050
You get one that's less curved,
one that's more curved.

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:16.129
Okay, now that's bonding.
 

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:17.839
How about dynamics?
 

00:05:17.839 --> 00:05:21.699
Well, suppose we have this
double minimum and suppose we

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:25.560
put a particle in and stop it
there so it has zero --

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.882
that's our zero of energy --
and then we're going to let it

00:05:28.882 --> 00:05:29.170
go.
 

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:32.379
What will it do if it's
classical?

00:05:32.379 --> 00:05:34.540
It'll roll back and forth,
right?

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:35.959
Bingo, let it go.
 

00:05:35.959 --> 00:05:38.576
Roll across,
to the same height,

00:05:38.576 --> 00:05:42.711
and roll back again,
and then roll across again to

00:05:42.711 --> 00:05:44.399
the same height.
 

00:05:44.399 --> 00:05:48.180
With no friction it goes on
forever, right?

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:54.141
But here's what happens
special, in real quantum

00:05:54.141 --> 00:06:02.103
mechanical systems --
oops, it went too far -- and

00:06:02.103 --> 00:06:11.470
now it's going to roll back and
forth on the right;

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:16.632
but every once in awhile it
goes across, from one well to

00:06:16.632 --> 00:06:17.740
the other.
 

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:22.678
Now, this is called tunneling,
for obvious reasons.

00:06:22.678 --> 00:06:23.470
Right?
 

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:26.470
But the word tunneling I hate.
 

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:27.990
It's one of my pet peeves.
 

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:31.297
It's misleading and
mischievous, because it suggests

00:06:31.297 --> 00:06:34.800
there's something weird about
the potential energy,

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:38.769
that you can tunnel through and
have a potential energy lower

00:06:38.769 --> 00:06:42.740
than you would've guessed from
the potential energy curve.

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:44.930
But that's not right.
 

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:48.819
What happens is when it's in
the middle you have negative

00:06:48.819 --> 00:06:50.000
kinetic energy.
 

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.086
You have the potential energy
that the curve shows,

00:06:53.086 --> 00:06:55.370
but the kinetic energy is
negative.

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:59.680
The potential energy can be
higher than the total.

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:01.819
And this happens in every bond
and wavefunction,

00:07:01.819 --> 00:07:07.033
as you saw in your problem set,
that the waves always go out

00:07:07.033 --> 00:07:12.161
into that forbidden region of
negative kinetic energy where

00:07:12.161 --> 00:07:15.519
they curve away from the
baseline.

00:07:15.519 --> 00:07:18.464
So there's the forbidden
region, out to the left,

00:07:18.464 --> 00:07:21.165
to the right,
and also in the middle for that

00:07:21.165 --> 00:07:21.595
energy.
 

00:07:21.595 --> 00:07:22.269
Right?
 

00:07:22.269 --> 00:07:27.115
And what really happens is that
you go to negative kinetic

00:07:27.115 --> 00:07:31.959
energy and high positive energy
to get over that hump,

00:07:31.959 --> 00:07:34.810
and then you get across to the
other side.

00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:38.379
Now how often does that happen?
 

00:07:38.379 --> 00:07:42.319
It turns out that the time to
get from one well to the other,

00:07:42.319 --> 00:07:46.300
which I won't be able to prove
to you because it requires

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:48.860
time-dependent quantum
mechanics,

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:51.483
and we're talking about
time-independent quantum

00:07:51.483 --> 00:07:53.634
mechanics,
but let me just tell you that

00:07:53.634 --> 00:07:55.970
the answer is,
if you know the energy

00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:58.930
difference between the blue and
the red,

00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:05.980
that the rate of getting across
is 5*10^-14 seconds,

00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:08.040
divided by whatever that energy
is,

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:10.608
expressed in kilocalories/mole.
 

00:08:10.608 --> 00:08:11.189
Right?
 

00:08:11.189 --> 00:08:13.824
This is just an assertion,
and it's based on

00:08:13.824 --> 00:08:15.970
time-dependent quantum
mechanics.

00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:18.620
It's true, but I'm not telling
you why.

00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:21.100
So you won't be satisfied,
I hope.

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:22.028
Okay?
 

00:08:22.028 --> 00:08:26.990
So the energy difference here
is 1.4 kilocalories/mole.

00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:30.790
So how rapidly does a particle
then get from -- if it started

00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:33.642
out in the left,
how long do you have to wait,

00:08:33.642 --> 00:08:36.428
on average, until it's in the
right one?

00:08:36.428 --> 00:08:40.605
You have to wait 5*10^-14
divided by 1.4,

00:08:40.605 --> 00:08:45.408
which means about 4*10^-14
seconds it takes to,

00:08:45.408 --> 00:08:50.735
quote, "tunnel";
although it really doesn't bore

00:08:50.735 --> 00:08:54.418
through, it goes over with
negative kinetic energy.

00:08:54.418 --> 00:08:56.830
Okay, so there's something else
about dynamics.

00:08:56.830 --> 00:09:00.535
And we're hoping soon to get to
reactivity, but that'll come

00:09:00.535 --> 00:09:03.299
after the exam,
after we talk about atoms and

00:09:03.299 --> 00:09:04.178
molecules.
 

00:09:04.178 --> 00:09:07.308
So now it looks like we're in a
pretty powerful position,

00:09:07.308 --> 00:09:09.710
at least with respect to one
dimension,

00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:14.532
because with this Erwin
program we can find satisfactory

00:09:14.532 --> 00:09:18.110
wavefunctions for any
complicated potential.

00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:20.616
We could make it anything we
would like and just follow the

00:09:20.616 --> 00:09:23.250
recipe,
find out allowed energies,

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:27.419
shapes of wavefunctions,
probability density,

00:09:27.419 --> 00:09:31.139
rates of tunneling,
all this kind of stuff,

00:09:31.139 --> 00:09:35.158
and we can rank all the
wavefunctions by their energy,

00:09:35.158 --> 00:09:38.750
or their curvature - the number
of nodes they have.

00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:43.250
Here's an unsatisfactory
wavefunction.

00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:47.210
What do you notice that's bad
about it, just to show that

00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:49.120
you've learned something?
 

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:49.629
Yes?
 

00:09:49.629 --> 00:09:51.509
Student:  It doesn't
start at the baseline.

00:09:51.509 --> 00:09:53.950
Prof: It doesn't start
at the baseline,

00:09:53.950 --> 00:09:54.710
on the left.
 

00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:56.879
How about on the right,
does it look okay on the right?

00:09:56.879 --> 00:09:59.909
&lt;&lt;Students speak over one
another&gt;&gt;

00:09:59.909 --> 00:10:00.778
Prof: Lucas?
 

00:10:00.778 --> 00:10:02.168
Student:  It tends to be
going down.

00:10:02.168 --> 00:10:08.091
Prof: Ah,
it crosses the baseline,

00:10:08.091 --> 00:10:11.940
in the forbidden region.
 

00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:14.919
If it crosses the baseline
while curving away,

00:10:14.919 --> 00:10:18.760
it's bound to go to negative
infinity, or positive infinity

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:21.144
if it crosses in the other
direction.

00:10:21.144 --> 00:10:21.940
Right?
 

00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:26.578
And on the left,
because it didn't get to the

00:10:26.578 --> 00:10:32.799
baseline when it became flat,
it's going to keep curving and

00:10:32.799 --> 00:10:35.120
go up to infinity.
 

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:38.320
So you've internalized a lot of
this stuff now.

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:41.850
Congratulations on doing well
on the problem set.

00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:42.940
Okay?
 

00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:43.960
So that was a bad one.
 

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:46.830
Okay, so it looks like we're in
pretty good shape.

00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:50.217
We even can handle multiple
minima and understand tunneling

00:10:50.217 --> 00:10:50.918
and so on.
 

00:10:50.918 --> 00:10:55.114
The unfortunate thing is this
curve tracing recipe doesn't

00:10:55.114 --> 00:10:57.690
work if you have more
dimensions.

00:10:57.690 --> 00:11:02.388
Remember, the reason it would
work is if you knew the

00:11:02.388 --> 00:11:06.956
potential and the total energy,
then you knew the kinetic

00:11:06.956 --> 00:11:09.591
energy, and you could assign it
to curvature.

00:11:09.591 --> 00:11:10.129
Right?
 

00:11:10.129 --> 00:11:13.537
But if you have two dimensions,
then there are two different

00:11:13.537 --> 00:11:17.059
curvatures you could assign it
to, and you don't know how much

00:11:17.059 --> 00:11:18.620
to put in each of them.
 

00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:21.544
So it's no longer such a
clear-cut problem if you have

00:11:21.544 --> 00:11:23.532
more dimensions,
especially 3n

00:11:23.532 --> 00:11:24.360
dimensions.
 

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:27.643
So when there are many
curvatures, it's not clear how

00:11:27.643 --> 00:11:29.788
to partition the kinetic energy.
 

00:11:29.788 --> 00:11:32.259
But Schrödinger had no
trouble.

00:11:32.259 --> 00:11:35.865
The Schrödinger equation
is what's called a differential

00:11:35.865 --> 00:11:37.849
equation, it involves
derivatives.

00:11:37.849 --> 00:11:38.450
Right?
 

00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:44.240
And how many people have had
differential equations?

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:47.437
Okay, maybe a fifth of you I
guess, or fewer.

00:11:47.437 --> 00:11:48.019
Right?
 

00:11:48.019 --> 00:11:50.605
So the rest of you are feeling,
"Gee I wish I knew

00:11:50.605 --> 00:11:53.480
differential equations because
then I could do this."

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:58.047
But you don't have to,
because people already have

00:11:58.047 --> 00:11:58.980
done it.
 

00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:01.687
You don't have to develop this
from ground zero,

00:12:01.687 --> 00:12:02.149
right?
 

00:12:02.149 --> 00:12:05.619
And Schrödinger didn't
solve the differential equations

00:12:05.619 --> 00:12:06.029
either.
 

00:12:06.029 --> 00:12:06.558
Right?
 

00:12:06.558 --> 00:12:09.763
He knew what the solutions
were, because people had been

00:12:09.763 --> 00:12:13.003
studying them forever,
and the reason they studied it

00:12:13.003 --> 00:12:15.440
was because of studying acoustic
waves,

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:17.600
and light also.
 

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:21.710
And Chladni is the guy who
originated this.

00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:26.210
And here we have a book by
Chladni called Acoustics.

00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:27.850
I got it out of the library.
 

00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:36.019
This is in fact the new,
unchanged edition from 1830.

00:12:36.019 --> 00:12:39.898
The original edition was
something like 1805 or something

00:12:39.898 --> 00:12:43.216
like that;
actually we'll see it here I

00:12:43.216 --> 00:12:43.840
think.
 

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:46.323
There's Chladni,
Ernst Florens Friedrich

00:12:46.323 --> 00:12:49.381
Chladni, and this is the title
page of that book,

00:12:49.381 --> 00:12:53.409
Acoustics;
the original one was 1803,

00:12:53.409 --> 00:12:54.860
ours is 1830.
 

00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:58.803
Okay, now what he did was take
plates of different -- he also

00:12:58.803 --> 00:13:02.750
did violin strings and timpani
heads and things like that.

00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:05.028
He was interested in all kinds
of acoustics.

00:13:05.028 --> 00:13:08.690
But the particular experiment
we're interested in was he would

00:13:08.690 --> 00:13:12.048
take a plate and suspend it in
the middle and touch it in

00:13:12.048 --> 00:13:15.336
different places,
while he was bowing it with a

00:13:15.336 --> 00:13:17.440
violin bow to make it vibrate.
 

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:18.970
Okay?
 

00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:20.480
So you bow it in different
places,

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:24.605
and he put sand on the surface
of this thing to see what

00:13:24.605 --> 00:13:28.580
patterns would be formed when
the thing vibrated --

00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:31.830
this is why violins have the
shape they have,

00:13:31.830 --> 00:13:37.201
so that they'll vibrate in
certain ways when you bow to

00:13:37.201 --> 00:13:41.250
make them vibrate --
and the sand collects where the

00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:44.431
plate isn't vibrating,
because when it's vibrating it

00:13:44.431 --> 00:13:45.360
shakes it away.
 

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:48.440
So you get a picture of the
pattern of vibration.

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:53.879
Now, I'm going to try to show
this to you.

00:13:53.879 --> 00:14:01.778
But it might not work,
and just in case I can go to

00:14:01.778 --> 00:14:03.360
the Web.
 

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:06.604
So what we have here is a -- I
can't play a violin,

00:14:06.604 --> 00:14:08.940
but as you know I can play a
bell.

00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:12.769
In fact, I can play a bell in
several ways;

00:14:12.769 --> 00:14:18.100
not only that,
&gt;

00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:29.259
I can do it this way too.
 

00:14:29.259 --> 00:14:44.340
&gt;
 

00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:47.129
Now, that's not a very pleasing
sound.

00:14:47.129 --> 00:14:50.259
Why?
 

00:14:50.259 --> 00:14:54.070
Why is it -- what's noise?
 

00:14:54.070 --> 00:14:56.429
I'm not very good at playing
the bell.

00:14:56.429 --> 00:15:01.168
&gt;
 

00:15:01.168 --> 00:15:04.120
Why does dry ice make a bell
ring?

00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:09.842
This was discovered in London
by an ice-cream vendor who had a

00:15:09.842 --> 00:15:14.254
bell on his cart,
and he asked a physics teacher,

00:15:14.254 --> 00:15:17.522
a woman in London,
why his bell rang when the

00:15:17.522 --> 00:15:19.720
dry-ice from his ice-cream hit
it.

00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:22.038
&gt;
 

00:15:22.038 --> 00:15:24.139
See, when you touch metal like
that,

00:15:24.139 --> 00:15:29.356
it gives heat to the dry ice,
which causes it to give off the

00:15:29.356 --> 00:15:32.182
pressure of gas,
but when it gives off the

00:15:32.182 --> 00:15:33.870
pressure and the metal moves
away,

00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:37.470
then heat's not being
transferred, so it stops.

00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:41.820
So you get rapid pulses of
CO_2, which make the thing ring.

00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:43.428
But depending on how you touch
it,

00:15:43.428 --> 00:15:45.053
you get noise,
because there are many

00:15:45.053 --> 00:15:47.758
different patterns of vibration
at different frequencies that

00:15:47.758 --> 00:15:48.840
are being generated.
 

00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:52.182
If I could do it just right,
I would generate just one pure

00:15:52.182 --> 00:15:55.181
tone and then you'd say,
"What a great player of

00:15:55.181 --> 00:15:56.450
bells he is."
 

00:15:56.450 --> 00:15:59.993
Okay, now I'm going to try
this, and I may fail in the same

00:15:59.993 --> 00:16:02.558
way, to do an experiment like
Chladni's.

00:16:02.558 --> 00:16:10.744
But instead of using a violin
bow -- I'm going to put sand on

00:16:10.744 --> 00:16:18.654
here -- instead of using a
violin bow I'm going to use this

00:16:18.654 --> 00:16:21.519
piece of dry ice.
 

00:16:21.519 --> 00:16:22.038
Okay?
 

00:16:22.038 --> 00:16:25.072
And I have to -- if I just
touch it, it won't do anything

00:16:25.072 --> 00:16:28.428
because I'll be touching sand
and I won't get heat transfer.

00:16:28.428 --> 00:16:32.131
So I have to brush a little bit
to get a clean part of the

00:16:32.131 --> 00:16:35.120
brass, and then let's see what
happens here.

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:43.250
&gt;
 

00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:44.817
Now I'm doing the same thing I
did with the bell,

00:16:44.817 --> 00:16:45.080
right?
 

00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:48.629
It's just noise.
 

00:16:48.629 --> 00:16:56.559
But let me try someplace else
here.

00:16:56.559 --> 00:16:58.269
This is an empirical science.
 

00:16:58.269 --> 00:17:12.568
&gt;
 

00:17:12.568 --> 00:17:19.490
&lt;&lt;amazed sounds and
laughter&gt;&gt;

00:17:19.490 --> 00:17:24.789
  Try something else
here.

00:17:24.789 --> 00:17:29.720
Spread some around here.
 

00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:35.940
If you're lucky,
this is really great.

00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:50.119
Hear that pure one?
 

00:17:50.119 --> 00:17:59.618
Maybe it's not sharp enough.
 

00:17:59.618 --> 00:18:14.269
We don't want to spend too much
time doing this.

00:18:14.269 --> 00:18:16.009
&gt;
 

00:18:16.009 --> 00:18:17.882
I want to try one more and then
we're going to -- you can go to

00:18:17.882 --> 00:18:19.118
the website and see a much
better once.

00:18:19.118 --> 00:18:23.088
Once I played just the lost
chord, a really beautiful tone;

00:18:23.088 --> 00:18:25.819
and it's on,
you can see it on the Web.

00:18:25.819 --> 00:18:29.890
&gt;
 

00:18:29.890 --> 00:18:33.340
I'm trying to find where and
how hard to touch so that I get

00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:34.569
a really pure tone.
 

00:18:34.569 --> 00:18:47.160
&gt;
 

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:49.500
Well, you can get patterns that
way.

00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:52.730
Okay, you can get much prettier
patterns and prettier tones than

00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:55.140
I'm able to coax out of the
thing right now,

00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:58.769
and you can look at it on the
Web to see it.

00:18:58.769 --> 00:19:23.548
&lt;&lt;projection
adjustments&gt;&gt;

00:19:23.548 --> 00:19:28.282
Okay, so these are some crude
Chladni figures that I've made

00:19:28.282 --> 00:19:32.928
in the past, three rings;
two rings with a line through

00:19:32.928 --> 00:19:34.980
the middle, vertically.
 

00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:36.901
That's the one we just made
now, I think,

00:19:36.901 --> 00:19:37.430
isn't it?
 

00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:39.609
Isn't it the same number?
 

00:19:39.609 --> 00:19:42.009
A ring and three diameters.
 

00:19:42.009 --> 00:19:45.940
And there's a circle and four
diameters.

00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:48.818
I actually made that in class
last year.

00:19:48.818 --> 00:19:53.769
Okay, these are ones that
Chladni did back in the late

00:19:53.769 --> 00:19:57.506
eighteenth century,
taken from that book,

00:19:57.506 --> 00:19:58.440
right?
 

00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:01.044
And here, the first ones are
just diameters,

00:20:01.044 --> 00:20:04.557
and the next ones are rings,
together with a certain number

00:20:04.557 --> 00:20:06.920
of diameters,
or two or more rings.

00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:10.068
Now let's see what that picture
means.

00:20:10.068 --> 00:20:14.230
Below you see a vertical
diameter and two rings.

00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:17.596
On top you see color coded as
to whether the plane,

00:20:17.596 --> 00:20:21.503
at an instant of vibration,
whether it's toward you or away

00:20:21.503 --> 00:20:24.558
from you, as it's vibrating;
that's the pattern.

00:20:24.558 --> 00:20:28.545
Because those lines don't move,
but either side of the line,

00:20:28.545 --> 00:20:31.720
one side moves up,
the other side moves down.

00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:32.440
Okay?
 

00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:35.470
Or you could look at it this
way.

00:20:35.470 --> 00:20:38.980
The dotted patterns and the
circles and the line don't move

00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:41.098
as the rest of the thing
deforms.

00:20:41.098 --> 00:20:45.420
This would be like a drum head
on a timpani.

00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:49.519
Got the idea?
 

00:20:49.519 --> 00:20:52.038
So that's the pattern of motion.
 

00:20:52.038 --> 00:20:58.618
Now Chladni was interested in
sound, right?

00:20:58.618 --> 00:21:03.336
So he found what pitch each of
these different patterns

00:21:03.336 --> 00:21:04.910
corresponded to.
 

00:21:04.910 --> 00:21:09.230
So this table shows the number
of diameters that are nodes,

00:21:09.230 --> 00:21:13.153
the number of circular nodes,
and what pitch it corresponds

00:21:13.153 --> 00:21:15.236
to,
and the little lines may mean

00:21:15.236 --> 00:21:17.490
it's a little sharp or a little
flat,

00:21:17.490 --> 00:21:18.650
something like that.
 

00:21:18.650 --> 00:21:22.626
For example,
the one with two diameters and

00:21:22.626 --> 00:21:25.089
no rings is the pitch C.
 

00:21:25.089 --> 00:21:26.920
Got the idea?
 

00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:29.539
So then he tried to figure out
if there's a mathematical

00:21:29.539 --> 00:21:31.160
relationship among these things.
 

00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:35.670
These were fourty-seven
patterns that he observed there.

00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:38.017
So here he says:
"The pitch relationships

00:21:38.017 --> 00:21:40.730
agree approximately with the
squares of the following

00:21:40.730 --> 00:21:41.670
numbers."
 

00:21:41.670 --> 00:21:44.538
So how many diameters,
how many circles,

00:21:44.538 --> 00:21:49.644
and what he sees is the
frequency is roughly the number

00:21:49.644 --> 00:21:53.046
of diameter nodes,
plus twice the number of

00:21:53.046 --> 00:21:55.759
circular nodes,
squared.

00:21:55.759 --> 00:21:58.160
This is his empirical
observation.

00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:02.597
So, for example,
you could have two diameters or

00:22:02.597 --> 00:22:07.695
one circle,
both would give the number two,

00:22:07.695 --> 00:22:12.451
which you then square,
to get something proportional

00:22:12.451 --> 00:22:13.523
to the frequency.
 

00:22:13.523 --> 00:22:14.028
Right?
 

00:22:14.028 --> 00:22:18.327
So there are two different ways
to get the same pitch -- that's

00:22:18.327 --> 00:22:21.240
what's crucial -- either rings
or lines.

00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:25.038
Or you can have a combination
of rings and lines.

00:22:25.038 --> 00:22:28.123
So for higher frequencies you
can get more and more

00:22:28.123 --> 00:22:30.588
combinations that give the same
pitch.

00:22:30.588 --> 00:22:32.016
For example,
the number eight,

00:22:32.016 --> 00:22:34.819
you can have four circles,
three circles and two lines;

00:22:34.819 --> 00:22:37.089
two circles and four lines;
a circle and six lines;

00:22:37.089 --> 00:22:38.170
or eight lines.
 

00:22:38.170 --> 00:22:41.334
All of them give the number
eight and all give the same

00:22:41.334 --> 00:22:43.210
pitch, at least approximately.
 

00:22:43.210 --> 00:22:44.210
Okay?
 

00:22:44.210 --> 00:22:48.040
So this is what he -- but the
lesson we want to take is that

00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:51.547
there are different ways of
getting the same frequency,

00:22:51.547 --> 00:22:53.818
by combinations of these nodes.
 

00:22:53.818 --> 00:22:57.983
Okay, now Chladni didn't solve
his problem mathematically about

00:22:57.983 --> 00:23:00.940
how plates or strings or
whatever vibrate.

00:23:00.940 --> 00:23:03.769
But there were great
mathematicians working on this,

00:23:03.769 --> 00:23:06.651
like Bernoulli,
Lagrange, Euler,

00:23:06.651 --> 00:23:11.019
who not only made a Communist
Germany stamp,

00:23:11.019 --> 00:23:14.130
he also made a Swiss ten-franc
note.

00:23:14.130 --> 00:23:15.650
Okay?
 

00:23:15.650 --> 00:23:19.759
Okay, so the Î¨s for
one-electron atoms --

00:23:19.759 --> 00:23:22.058
now we're going from one
dimension into three dimensions,

00:23:22.058 --> 00:23:24.970
for a real atom,
electron and an atom --

00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:27.964
so for one-electron atom
there's going to be three

00:23:27.964 --> 00:23:29.319
variables,
x, y,

00:23:29.319 --> 00:23:32.077
z for the electron,
and the solutions,

00:23:32.077 --> 00:23:36.154
the waves we're going to get,
involve what are called

00:23:36.154 --> 00:23:39.762
spherical harmonics,
and they're 3D analogues of

00:23:39.762 --> 00:23:41.470
Chladni's 2D figures.
 

00:23:41.470 --> 00:23:45.638
These mathematicians could work
in three dimensions as well as

00:23:45.638 --> 00:23:46.048
two.
 

00:23:46.048 --> 00:23:49.950
Okay, so a 3-dimensional H-atom
wavefunction,

00:23:49.950 --> 00:23:54.534
Î¨,
can be written as a product of

00:23:54.534 --> 00:23:57.545
three functions,
an R function,

00:23:57.545 --> 00:24:00.660
a Î˜ function,
and a Î¦ function.

00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:05.028
And these were available from
other old-time mathematicians.

00:24:05.028 --> 00:24:08.082
The R function is called
the Associated Laguerre

00:24:08.082 --> 00:24:10.740
Function, and it's named for
Edmond Laguerre.

00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:16.704
And the Î˜ function
is called the normalized

00:24:16.704 --> 00:24:23.430
Associated Legendre Polynomial,
after Adrien-Marie Legendre.

00:24:23.430 --> 00:24:24.039
Okay?
 

00:24:24.039 --> 00:24:26.410
Now here are the solutions.
 

00:24:26.410 --> 00:24:30.240
Schrödinger didn't find
these, he just looked them up.

00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:33.039
These guys had already done it,
from acoustics,

00:24:33.039 --> 00:24:35.111
for 3-dimensional things
vibrating.

00:24:35.111 --> 00:24:35.720
Right?
 

00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:39.078
So here's a table that
you can use,

00:24:39.078 --> 00:24:41.838
the same way Schrödinger
would've used it,

00:24:41.838 --> 00:24:47.390
to find out what wavefunctions
for electrons in one-electron

00:24:47.390 --> 00:24:49.930
atoms actually look like.
 

00:24:49.930 --> 00:24:53.256
In all your books you've seen
pictures of these things but

00:24:53.256 --> 00:24:56.109
you've never seen --
my guess is -- you've never

00:24:56.109 --> 00:24:59.047
seen the real thing,
and you should wonder,

00:24:59.047 --> 00:25:02.739
"Are these pictures that
people have shown me

00:25:02.739 --> 00:25:03.868
right?"
 

00:25:03.868 --> 00:25:09.839
&lt;&lt;projection
adjustments&gt;&gt;

00:25:09.839 --> 00:25:11.400
Now how do you understand?
 

00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:13.731
This looks pretty complicated,
this table, and in a sense it

00:25:13.731 --> 00:25:13.930
is.
 

00:25:13.930 --> 00:25:18.220
But if you look at it the right
way it's really pretty simple.

00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:21.773
It relates to the position of
an electron, shown on the right

00:25:21.773 --> 00:25:23.730
there, relative to the nucleus.
 

00:25:23.730 --> 00:25:27.827
And there's only one electron;
it's a one-electron atom,

00:25:27.827 --> 00:25:31.028
otherwise we have more
dimensions.

00:25:31.028 --> 00:25:33.670
But the nucleus can have any
charge you want it to.

00:25:33.670 --> 00:25:37.958
So it's a one-electron atom of
any nuclear charge,

00:25:37.958 --> 00:25:42.334
and we have the coordinates,
x, y, z, and we have a

00:25:42.334 --> 00:25:43.558
potential.
 

00:25:43.558 --> 00:25:49.730
What's the potential law that's
given to us, whose law?

00:25:49.730 --> 00:25:50.568
Student:  Coulomb's.
 

00:25:50.568 --> 00:25:52.382
Prof: Coulomb's law.
 

00:25:52.382 --> 00:25:53.858
So it's 1/r^2.
 

00:25:53.858 --> 00:25:55.029
And how do you write
r^2?;

00:25:55.029 --> 00:25:59.589
r^2 is x^2 + y^2 +
z^2.

00:25:59.589 --> 00:26:02.549
Right, everybody know that?
 

00:26:02.549 --> 00:26:03.859
Everybody know that?
 

00:26:03.859 --> 00:26:06.818
Good, nod, yes;
good, okay we're on the same

00:26:06.818 --> 00:26:07.548
page here.
 

00:26:07.548 --> 00:26:10.888
Okay, but that's a pretty
complicated function,

00:26:10.888 --> 00:26:11.470
right?
 

00:26:11.470 --> 00:26:14.875
So the equations that involve
that are going to be really,

00:26:14.875 --> 00:26:16.130
really complicated.
 

00:26:16.130 --> 00:26:20.410
But there's a clever way to get
around this.

00:26:20.410 --> 00:26:25.368
Do you know what that way is?
 

00:26:25.368 --> 00:26:30.880
What's the clever way of
getting around this?

00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:34.452
The clever way of getting
around it is to change the

00:26:34.452 --> 00:26:38.728
coordinates of the system that
you're using to one that's more

00:26:38.728 --> 00:26:40.690
natural for the problem.
 

00:26:40.690 --> 00:26:45.441
And the one that's natural for
the problem is spherical polar

00:26:45.441 --> 00:26:46.548
coordinates.
 

00:26:46.548 --> 00:26:48.650
So the three dimensions are
r,

00:26:48.650 --> 00:26:50.690
the distance,
and Î¸,

00:26:50.690 --> 00:26:53.279
the angle down from the z axis,
and Ï†,

00:26:53.279 --> 00:26:56.640
the angle rotated around from
the x axis.

00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:58.279
Student:  Isn't it the
other way around?

00:26:58.279 --> 00:26:59.970
Prof: Well you can
define it any way you want to.

00:26:59.970 --> 00:27:02.769
This is the way it's defined
for these purposes.

00:27:02.769 --> 00:27:05.038
Okay?
 

00:27:05.038 --> 00:27:11.008
Now, so that simplifies the
expression for potential

00:27:11.008 --> 00:27:12.528
enormously.
 

00:27:12.528 --> 00:27:16.261
Instead of being
1/âˆšx^2 + y^2/c^2,

00:27:16.261 --> 00:27:20.319
it's 1/r,
or some constant over r.

00:27:20.319 --> 00:27:21.200
Okay?
 

00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:25.756
And what that means is -- and
this is the mathematical payoff

00:27:25.756 --> 00:27:29.660
--
that the wavefunction can be

00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:35.058
written as a product of three
functions,

00:27:35.058 --> 00:27:38.858
each of which is the function
of only one variable.

00:27:38.858 --> 00:27:41.232
Instead of having x^2^(
)and y^2^( )and^( )

00:27:41.232 --> 00:27:43.435
z^2^(2) all mixed
together in this complicated

00:27:43.435 --> 00:27:45.961
function,
you have a function only of

00:27:45.961 --> 00:27:49.019
r,
a function only of Î¸,

00:27:49.019 --> 00:27:53.115
and a function only of Ï†,
and you multiply them together

00:27:53.115 --> 00:27:56.808
and you get the solution to the
Schrödinger equation for a

00:27:56.808 --> 00:27:58.058
one-electron atom.
 

00:27:58.058 --> 00:28:04.798
Now, that -- this table --
gives you those functions,

00:28:04.798 --> 00:28:06.428
the R function,
the Î˜ function,

00:28:06.428 --> 00:28:07.470
and the Î¦ function.
 

00:28:07.470 --> 00:28:10.324
It's like a restaurant where
you get to choose one from

00:28:10.324 --> 00:28:13.390
column A, one from column B,
one from column C -- right?

00:28:13.390 --> 00:28:17.046
-- here's your appetizer,
your main course and your

00:28:17.046 --> 00:28:18.288
dessert, right?
 

00:28:18.288 --> 00:28:21.011
So you choose one of these,
one of these,

00:28:21.011 --> 00:28:23.461
one of these,
multiply them together,

00:28:23.461 --> 00:28:25.570
and you have the true function.
 

00:28:25.570 --> 00:28:26.318
Right?
 

00:28:26.318 --> 00:28:28.548
Now they look very,
very complicated.

00:28:28.548 --> 00:28:31.720
You can't choose any
combination you want to.

00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:36.140
Once you've chosen one -- once
you've chosen your appetizer --

00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:38.960
you can only have certain main
courses,

00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:41.388
and once you've chosen that,
you can only have certain

00:28:41.388 --> 00:28:43.578
desserts,
to get solutions. Right?

00:28:43.578 --> 00:28:46.041
This is what these
mathematicians had all figured

00:28:46.041 --> 00:28:46.349
out.
 

00:28:46.349 --> 00:28:47.630
Okay?
 

00:28:47.630 --> 00:28:52.509
And so how do we go about doing
it?

00:28:52.509 --> 00:28:56.095
Well we can name the
Î¨ we're going to get

00:28:56.095 --> 00:28:59.308
by a nickname,
like 1s or 2p_x

00:28:59.308 --> 00:29:03.481
or something like that,
but you can also name it by the

00:29:03.481 --> 00:29:07.170
numbers that name these
individual functions,

00:29:07.170 --> 00:29:09.160
and those are n,
l and m,

00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:13.299
which I think you've
encountered before probably.

00:29:13.299 --> 00:29:16.000
So let's make a try at it.
 

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.781
No, actually notice something
about the complicated form of

00:29:18.781 --> 00:29:19.548
the functions.
 

00:29:19.548 --> 00:29:24.950
First, every one of them has
Z/a_0 to the 3/2 power.

00:29:24.950 --> 00:29:29.355
Z is the nuclear charge;
a_0 is a unit of length

00:29:29.355 --> 00:29:31.859
of about half an angstrom about.
 

00:29:31.859 --> 00:29:36.220
Okay, so to the 3/2 power;
that's pretty weird.

00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:38.450
But remember what you're going
to do with the wavefunction?

00:29:38.450 --> 00:29:40.173
What do you do with
wavefunctions,

00:29:40.173 --> 00:29:41.480
other than find energy?
 

00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:43.058
Students:  Probability.
 

00:29:43.058 --> 00:29:46.087
Prof: Get probability
density, and what do you do to

00:29:46.087 --> 00:29:46.819
do that Sam?
 

00:29:46.819 --> 00:29:47.789
Student:  Square it.
 

00:29:47.789 --> 00:29:48.930
Prof: You square it.
 

00:29:48.930 --> 00:29:52.507
So when you square it,
it's going to be

00:29:52.507 --> 00:29:56.180
(Z/a_0)^3,
when you square it.

00:29:56.180 --> 00:29:58.450
Everybody with me on that?
 

00:29:58.450 --> 00:30:03.445
Okay, so what that means is
you're going to get units that

00:30:03.445 --> 00:30:08.117
are Z^3 per unit volume;
because remember a_0 is

00:30:08.117 --> 00:30:08.829
a distance.
 

00:30:08.829 --> 00:30:11.740
So a_0^3 is a volume.
 

00:30:11.740 --> 00:30:15.084
So it's going to get a number
-- the nuclear charge is a

00:30:15.084 --> 00:30:17.830
number Z,
the atomic number is a number

00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:20.630
-- so it's going to get a number
per unit volume,

00:30:20.630 --> 00:30:25.809
which is the right units to
have for probability density.

00:30:25.809 --> 00:30:27.869
What is it per unit volume?
 

00:30:27.869 --> 00:30:28.730
Okay?
 

00:30:28.730 --> 00:30:33.019
So this is just the bit that
scales it right so that you get

00:30:33.019 --> 00:30:35.930
the right density and the right
units.

00:30:35.930 --> 00:30:39.526
So you can drop that out,
that's not something very

00:30:39.526 --> 00:30:41.538
fundamentally interesting.
 

00:30:41.538 --> 00:30:44.859
Okay, let's try making up a
1s orbital.

00:30:44.859 --> 00:30:48.230
Where do you start?
 

00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:50.619
Can somebody tell me where to
choose?

00:30:50.619 --> 00:30:51.890
It's not hard.
 

00:30:51.890 --> 00:30:53.838
They're labeled with red, right?
 

00:30:53.838 --> 00:30:56.519
If you want 1s,
you choose the top one.

00:30:56.519 --> 00:30:57.858
Okay?
 

00:30:57.858 --> 00:31:05.851
And now if you've done that,
n is one and l is

00:31:05.851 --> 00:31:06.798
zero.
 

00:31:06.798 --> 00:31:11.558
So when you come to the next
one, l has to be zero.

00:31:11.558 --> 00:31:16.880
Now m can be either zero
or one;

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:20.304
or no, actually wait a second,
if it's 1 -- no,

00:31:20.304 --> 00:31:23.952
if l is zero,
then m has to be zero,

00:31:23.952 --> 00:31:26.410
it says in the second column.
 

00:31:26.410 --> 00:31:28.829
Does everybody see that?
 

00:31:28.829 --> 00:31:30.028
See up at the top?
 

00:31:30.028 --> 00:31:34.471
It says if l is zero,
then m can be zero;

00:31:34.471 --> 00:31:35.460
lm.
 

00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:36.160
Okay?
 

00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:40.372
For m,
pardon me, to be non-zero,

00:31:40.372 --> 00:31:46.636
like here, you have to have an
l that's greater than

00:31:46.636 --> 00:31:47.609
zero.
 

00:31:47.609 --> 00:31:48.640
Okay?
 

00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:52.428
So to get a solution,
if you chose n one and

00:31:52.428 --> 00:31:56.280
l had to be zero --
because remember that's the

00:31:56.280 --> 00:31:58.885
only choice here,
you can't have a higher

00:31:58.885 --> 00:32:02.019
l -- then m is
also going to be zero.

00:32:02.019 --> 00:32:05.150
So you've got to take this
times this times this.

00:32:05.150 --> 00:32:06.450
Okay?
 

00:32:06.450 --> 00:32:13.338
Now how complicated are those
functions?

00:32:13.338 --> 00:32:16.904
Okay, âˆš2/2,
that's just a constant,

00:32:16.904 --> 00:32:19.028
that's a nothing function.
 

00:32:19.028 --> 00:32:24.118
Or 1/âˆš(2Ï€),
big deal.

00:32:24.118 --> 00:32:26.118
Why do you have these constants
in there?

00:32:26.118 --> 00:32:31.164
Why do you care what constant
you multiply the wavefunction

00:32:31.164 --> 00:32:31.599
by?
 

00:32:31.599 --> 00:32:32.400
Student:  No idea.
 

00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:33.470
Prof: For what purpose?
 

00:32:33.470 --> 00:32:34.470
Student:  Normalization.
 

00:32:34.470 --> 00:32:36.019
Prof: For normalization,
right?

00:32:36.019 --> 00:32:38.949
If you want to get -- but if
all you want is the shape,

00:32:38.949 --> 00:32:39.980
forget constants.
 

00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:45.529
So what's the real working part
of the 1s wavefunction?

00:32:45.529 --> 00:32:47.420
What's the part that varies?
 

00:32:47.420 --> 00:32:49.569
We have here the
(Z/a_0)^3/2;

00:32:49.569 --> 00:32:51.867
forget that;
two, forget that,

00:32:51.867 --> 00:32:54.452
âˆš2/2 forget that,
in fact the 2s would

00:32:54.452 --> 00:32:56.587
cancel;
âˆš2 here would cancel that

00:32:56.587 --> 00:32:59.529
âˆš2;
so it's 1/âˆšÏ€

00:32:59.529 --> 00:33:05.180
times this, times what?;
e^(-Ï /2).

00:33:05.180 --> 00:33:08.028
That's the real working part of
it.

00:33:08.028 --> 00:33:08.700
Right?
 

00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:12.401
When you square it,
what are you going to get,

00:33:12.401 --> 00:33:14.538
for e^(-Ï /2)?
 

00:33:14.538 --> 00:33:19.920
What's e^(-Ï /2)
squared?

00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:21.538
Yes Alex?
 

00:33:21.538 --> 00:33:23.579
Student: 
e^-Ï .

00:33:23.579 --> 00:33:24.068
Prof: e^-Ï .
 

00:33:24.068 --> 00:33:27.406
Okay, so the probability
density is going to be

00:33:27.406 --> 00:33:30.019
e^-Ï ,
times a constant.

00:33:30.019 --> 00:33:31.308
Okay, so here we got it.
 

00:33:31.308 --> 00:33:34.380
It's a constant times
e^(-Ï /2);

00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:36.558
when we square it,
it's e^-Ï .

00:33:36.558 --> 00:33:39.692
Now, there's something -- there
are two things

00:33:39.692 --> 00:33:41.180
that are interesting here.
 

00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:43.493
One, we wanted to get a
function of r,

00:33:43.493 --> 00:33:45.125
Î¸ and
Ï†,

00:33:45.125 --> 00:33:46.807
but we don't have r in
it.

00:33:46.807 --> 00:33:47.440
Right?
 

00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:49.558
We have Ï  instead.
 

00:33:49.558 --> 00:33:53.329
Why do we substitute r
by Ï ?

00:33:53.329 --> 00:33:55.160
There's a good reason for that.
 

00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:58.368
Ï  is defined --
which is, indeed,

00:33:58.368 --> 00:34:02.549
the Greek version of r is
Ï  -- it's defined as

00:34:02.549 --> 00:34:04.788
r times a constant.
 

00:34:04.788 --> 00:34:07.461
The constant is twice the
atomic number,

00:34:07.461 --> 00:34:10.201
divided by n,
the quantum level n,

00:34:10.201 --> 00:34:12.119
times that distance a_0.
 

00:34:12.119 --> 00:34:13.949
And why do you do it that way?
 

00:34:13.949 --> 00:34:19.610
It's because if you do it that
way, then the same Ï 

00:34:19.610 --> 00:34:23.601
works, no matter what the
nuclear charge is,

00:34:23.601 --> 00:34:26.849
and no matter what n is.
 

00:34:26.849 --> 00:34:31.039
So you get the same -- so it
makes the table very compact,

00:34:31.039 --> 00:34:35.014
because you use the same thing
no matter what atom you're

00:34:35.014 --> 00:34:37.514
dealing with,
if you work in units of

00:34:37.514 --> 00:34:39.590
Ï  rather than
r;

00:34:39.590 --> 00:34:43.159
that is scale r,
to take into account the fact

00:34:43.159 --> 00:34:46.179
that you can have various
nuclear charges.

00:34:46.179 --> 00:34:49.626
Okay, allows using the same
e^(-Ï /2) for any

00:34:49.626 --> 00:34:52.500
nuclear charge (Z) and
any n.

00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:58.362
And notice, every one of these
has e^(-Ï /2)^( )on

00:34:58.362 --> 00:34:58.860
it.
 

00:34:58.860 --> 00:35:00.920
Now, why does that make sense?
 

00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:07.070
Why is it no surprise that
these things have e^-r?

00:35:07.070 --> 00:35:14.119
Have we ever seen that before,
e^-x as a wavefunction?

00:35:14.119 --> 00:35:17.822
What kind of wavefunction --
what does that mean when you

00:35:17.822 --> 00:35:19.079
have e^-r?
 

00:35:19.079 --> 00:35:21.059
&lt;&lt;Students speak over one
another&gt;&gt;

00:35:21.059 --> 00:35:26.639
Prof: That's a constant
negative kinetic energy,

00:35:26.639 --> 00:35:29.923
constant negative kinetic
energy, which is going to be the

00:35:29.923 --> 00:35:32.460
situation for any nucleus and an
electron.

00:35:32.460 --> 00:35:36.739
Once the electron gets pretty
far away, the energy stops

00:35:36.739 --> 00:35:37.438
changing.
 

00:35:37.438 --> 00:35:38.139
Right?
 

00:35:38.139 --> 00:35:40.952
So the potential energy is
constant, the kinetic energy is

00:35:40.952 --> 00:35:41.396
constant.
 

00:35:41.396 --> 00:35:41.840
Right?
 

00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:46.414
If the electron is bound to the
nucleus, that means it can't

00:35:46.414 --> 00:35:49.050
just fly off to infinity,
right?

00:35:49.050 --> 00:35:53.010
So it's below the ultimate
potential energy.

00:35:53.010 --> 00:35:56.914
Then you have constant negative
kinetic energy,

00:35:56.914 --> 00:36:00.480
when you're far from the
nucleus, right?

00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:01.820
So e^-Ï ^(.
 

00:36:01.820 --> 00:36:04.597
) So it doesn't surprise you
that every one of these has

00:36:04.597 --> 00:36:05.809
e^-Ï  in it.
 

00:36:05.809 --> 00:36:11.659
Okay, now let's just look at
this scaling quickly.

00:36:11.659 --> 00:36:14.907
Okay, so here's
e^-Ï ^( )and Ï 

00:36:14.907 --> 00:36:17.659
-- as a function of
Ï .

00:36:17.659 --> 00:36:18.250
Okay?
 

00:36:18.250 --> 00:36:21.199
Now suppose -- so we can
rearrange this.

00:36:21.199 --> 00:36:22.530
r is that.
 

00:36:22.530 --> 00:36:26.273
If we wanted to make a new
plot, which has the horizontal

00:36:26.273 --> 00:36:29.282
axis being r,
being distance instead of

00:36:29.282 --> 00:36:30.420
Ï .
 

00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:34.539
Okay now, so r for a
hydrogen atom,

00:36:34.539 --> 00:36:37.409
the 1s orbital of a
hydrogen atom,

00:36:37.409 --> 00:36:43.210
is 0.53 -- so n is one,
a_0 is half an angstrom,

00:36:43.210 --> 00:36:47.072
Z is one;
so it's .53/2 times

00:36:47.072 --> 00:36:48.349
Ï .
 

00:36:48.349 --> 00:36:51.159
So we could just put a new
scale on there.

00:36:51.159 --> 00:36:55.117
So here's half an angstrom for
a hydrogen, here's one angstrom

00:36:55.117 --> 00:36:56.219
for a hydrogen.
 

00:36:56.219 --> 00:36:59.733
Everybody with me on this so
far, how I did that?

00:36:59.733 --> 00:37:00.320
Right?
 

00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:04.353
I just went through and found
out for any given Ï 

00:37:04.353 --> 00:37:05.849
here,
that I already had,

00:37:05.849 --> 00:37:08.150
one, two, three,
four, five, e^-Ï .

00:37:08.150 --> 00:37:10.963
For any give Ï ,
what would the r be if I

00:37:10.963 --> 00:37:12.789
were talking about a hydrogen
atom?

00:37:12.789 --> 00:37:13.309
Okay?
 

00:37:13.309 --> 00:37:14.989
And I just put a new scale on
there.

00:37:14.989 --> 00:37:18.010
Now if I were talking about a
carbon atom,

00:37:18.010 --> 00:37:21.260
which has a nuclear charge of
plus six,

00:37:21.260 --> 00:37:27.110
then this number Z is
going to be much bigger,

00:37:27.110 --> 00:37:28.809
it's going to be six times as
big.

00:37:28.809 --> 00:37:34.159
What effect will that have on
the scale?

00:37:34.159 --> 00:37:39.409
So suppose we're at five,
for Ï .

00:37:39.409 --> 00:37:43.943
Instead of dividing by one,
for Z here,

00:37:43.943 --> 00:37:47.369
I'm going to be dividing by
six.

00:37:47.369 --> 00:37:51.130
So I'm going to get much
shorter distances,

00:37:51.130 --> 00:37:54.713
real distances,
rather than Ï .

00:37:54.713 --> 00:37:55.610
Right?
 

00:37:55.610 --> 00:38:00.148
Does that surprise you -- that
the function is going to squash

00:38:00.148 --> 00:38:03.199
in if I have a plus six nuclear
charge?

00:38:03.199 --> 00:38:05.719
Does it surprise you or not?
 

00:38:05.719 --> 00:38:06.719
It's what you expect.
 

00:38:06.719 --> 00:38:10.190
A bigger charge is going to
suck the electrons in more.

00:38:10.190 --> 00:38:10.900
Okay?
 

00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:15.221
So if I do it for carbon,
I get .53/12 instead of .53/2,

00:38:15.221 --> 00:38:18.599
and the scale is going to look
like that.

00:38:18.599 --> 00:38:21.778
Instead of this being 0.5 here
for hydrogen,

00:38:21.778 --> 00:38:23.110
it's 0.1, right?
 

00:38:23.110 --> 00:38:26.056
So then if I squash it in so
that they're on the same scale

00:38:26.056 --> 00:38:27.800
--
those are different angstrom

00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:29.670
scales for carbon and hydrogen
--

00:38:29.670 --> 00:38:34.041
if I make them the same scale,
the bigger nuclear charge sucks

00:38:34.041 --> 00:38:36.980
the 1s function in by a factor
of six,

00:38:36.980 --> 00:38:39.110
and it looks like that.
 

00:38:39.110 --> 00:38:41.376
But now, of course,
if I want the real,

00:38:41.376 --> 00:38:44.121
the normalized function,
it's got to be higher,

00:38:44.121 --> 00:38:46.449
so that the total area is the
same.

00:38:46.449 --> 00:38:49.590
I have the squared function
here, e^-Ï ;

00:38:49.590 --> 00:38:52.719
remember that the wavefunction
was e^(-Ï /2);

00:38:52.719 --> 00:38:54.559
the density is e^-Ï .
 

00:38:54.559 --> 00:38:58.070
To get the same thing I'm going
to have to multiply that by six.

00:38:58.070 --> 00:39:00.340
So it's going to look like that.
 

00:39:00.340 --> 00:39:04.130
So that's how the radial
distribution,

00:39:04.130 --> 00:39:05.659
probability density
distribution,

00:39:05.659 --> 00:39:08.987
looks different,
for a one-electron atom with a

00:39:08.987 --> 00:39:12.130
plus one or a plus six nuclear
charge.

00:39:12.130 --> 00:39:15.512
Carbon holds its core electrons
in much more tightly than

00:39:15.512 --> 00:39:18.809
hydrogen does;
no big surprise there.

00:39:18.809 --> 00:39:20.820
Okay.
 

00:39:20.820 --> 00:39:23.980
So here's something to think
about.

00:39:23.980 --> 00:39:28.492
How would it differ if instead
of talking about the 1s

00:39:28.492 --> 00:39:31.576
orbital of carbon,
I was talking about the

00:39:31.576 --> 00:39:33.681
2s orbital of carbon?
 

00:39:33.681 --> 00:39:34.510
Right?
 

00:39:34.510 --> 00:39:36.670
Now, Ï  is going to
be different,

00:39:36.670 --> 00:39:39.190
and here, instead of one,
it's going to be twp.

00:39:39.190 --> 00:39:41.929
So it's going to change the
scale by a factor of two.

00:39:41.929 --> 00:39:46.409
So the 2s are further
out.

00:39:46.409 --> 00:39:50.239
Okay, so for Wednesday I want
you to do these problems --

00:39:50.239 --> 00:39:53.039
you can do them in groups if
you want to --

00:39:53.039 --> 00:39:57.295
some about Chladni Figures,
and then some things about

00:39:57.295 --> 00:40:00.670
energy and some atomic orbital
problems.

00:40:00.670 --> 00:40:01.260
Okay?
 

00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:03.409
Now we already looked at the
1s.

00:40:03.409 --> 00:40:07.340
Let's look at some other atomic
orbitals.

00:40:07.340 --> 00:40:09.552
Incidentally,
this function,

00:40:09.552 --> 00:40:13.896
the Coulombic function,
is simpler in three dimensions

00:40:13.896 --> 00:40:16.518
than it is in one dimension.
 

00:40:16.518 --> 00:40:19.614
It was that complicated thing
in one-dimension,

00:40:19.614 --> 00:40:21.969
remember that had the cusp on
it.

00:40:21.969 --> 00:40:24.929
It was a really complicated
function, but it's really simple

00:40:24.929 --> 00:40:27.137
in three dimensions,
it's just exponential in

00:40:27.137 --> 00:40:27.789
r.
 

00:40:27.789 --> 00:40:30.340
How does it vary with
Î¸?

00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:34.202
As you come down from the axis,
how does the wavefunction vary,

00:40:34.202 --> 00:40:35.199
the 1s?
 

00:40:35.199 --> 00:40:36.860
What does it say?
 

00:40:36.860 --> 00:40:38.719
How does it depend on
Î¸?

00:40:38.719 --> 00:40:39.289
Student:  It doesn't.
 

00:40:39.289 --> 00:40:39.829
Prof: It doesn't.
 

00:40:39.829 --> 00:40:41.159
How does it depend on
Ï†?

00:40:41.159 --> 00:40:41.710
Student:  It doesn't.
 

00:40:41.710 --> 00:40:42.320
Prof: It doesn't.
 

00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:44.119
So what shape does it have?
 

00:40:44.119 --> 00:40:44.610
Student:  A sphere.
 

00:40:44.610 --> 00:40:47.451
Prof: It's spherically
symmetric, it depends only on

00:40:47.451 --> 00:40:47.989
r.
 

00:40:47.989 --> 00:40:51.349
And the dependence on r
is as easy as pie,

00:40:51.349 --> 00:40:54.800
it's just e^-r^( )(or
Ï  --

00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:56.739
it depends on what units you
measure r in).

00:40:56.739 --> 00:40:59.050
Okay, now let's look at
2s.

00:40:59.050 --> 00:41:00.320
Now tell me what to do.
 

00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:03.860
How do I write a 2s
function from this table?

00:41:03.860 --> 00:41:06.210
First I have to choose the
appetizer.

00:41:06.210 --> 00:41:07.269
Where do I go?
 

00:41:07.269 --> 00:41:08.070
Student:  Second one.
 

00:41:08.070 --> 00:41:09.909
Prof: Second one down is
2s.

00:41:09.909 --> 00:41:11.268
Okay?
 

00:41:11.268 --> 00:41:14.753
So I take this one,
and now 2s,

00:41:14.753 --> 00:41:17.579
that means l is zero.
 

00:41:17.579 --> 00:41:21.849
So where do I go;
what direction do I go?

00:41:21.849 --> 00:41:22.900
Here.
 

00:41:22.900 --> 00:41:24.949
And then what direction do I go?
 

00:41:24.949 --> 00:41:25.440
Student:  Straight
across.

00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:27.489
Prof: Straight across,
because m is zero.

00:41:27.489 --> 00:41:29.010
Okay.
 

00:41:29.010 --> 00:41:32.309
So here's -- there's 2s;
multiply those together.

00:41:32.309 --> 00:41:37.300
Now what's interesting,
there are a bunch of constants

00:41:37.300 --> 00:41:42.010
that are going to give me --
make it normalized.

00:41:42.010 --> 00:41:43.730
So that's a constant,
that's a constant,

00:41:43.730 --> 00:41:46.219
just like they were before;
this is a constant,

00:41:46.219 --> 00:41:47.429
that's a constant.
 

00:41:47.429 --> 00:41:53.297
But this part is interesting:
(2-Ï ) times

00:41:53.297 --> 00:41:55.829
e^(-Ï /2).
 

00:41:55.829 --> 00:41:58.554
That's the function that we're
interested in,

00:41:58.554 --> 00:42:01.340
(2-Ï ) times
e^(-Ï /2).

00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:02.518
That has an interesting thing.
 

00:42:02.518 --> 00:42:06.530
What happens when Ï 
has the value two?

00:42:06.530 --> 00:42:10.760
It has the e^(-Ï /2);
that's just decaying,

00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:12.820
all of them have that.
 

00:42:12.820 --> 00:42:14.570
But how about the
2-Ï ?

00:42:14.570 --> 00:42:17.018
That gives an interesting thing.
 

00:42:17.018 --> 00:42:19.730
What's its value when Ï 
is two?

00:42:19.730 --> 00:42:20.239
Student:  Zero.
 

00:42:20.239 --> 00:42:21.159
Prof: Zero.
 

00:42:21.159 --> 00:42:23.980
So there's a node.
 

00:42:23.980 --> 00:42:25.949
What shape is the node?
 

00:42:25.949 --> 00:42:28.103
Is it a point,
is it a line,

00:42:28.103 --> 00:42:29.940
is it a wiggly thing?
 

00:42:29.940 --> 00:42:30.690
Student:  A sphere.
 

00:42:30.690 --> 00:42:32.791
Prof: It's a sphere,
it's spherically symmetric

00:42:32.791 --> 00:42:33.110
again.
 

00:42:33.110 --> 00:42:34.590
So there's a spherical node.
 

00:42:34.590 --> 00:42:38.760
So inside -- and at a node,
the wavefunction changes sign.

00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:42.800
So inside it's one sign,
outside it's the opposite sign.

00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:46.909
Okay?
 

00:42:46.909 --> 00:42:50.030
Now how about a 2p_z
orbital?

00:42:50.030 --> 00:42:52.250
So where are we going to go?
 

00:42:52.250 --> 00:42:56.068
2p, we'll start with
this, and for p_z,

00:42:56.068 --> 00:42:59.152
we do this one,
and for z we do this

00:42:59.152 --> 00:42:59.739
one.
 

00:42:59.739 --> 00:43:01.480
So it's this times this times
this.

00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:02.960
I think I have that circled
here;

00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:04.389
let's see, yeah.
 

00:43:04.389 --> 00:43:06.070
Is this one interesting?
 

00:43:06.070 --> 00:43:06.510
Student:  No.
 

00:43:06.510 --> 00:43:07.250
Prof: No.
 

00:43:07.250 --> 00:43:08.030
Is this one interesting?
 

00:43:08.030 --> 00:43:08.989
Student:  Yes.
 

00:43:08.989 --> 00:43:11.269
Prof: What part of it is
interesting?

00:43:11.269 --> 00:43:12.309
Student:  Cosine.
 

00:43:12.309 --> 00:43:13.322
Prof:
cos(Î¸) is

00:43:13.322 --> 00:43:13.949
interesting, right?
 

00:43:13.949 --> 00:43:15.760
That's real variation.
 

00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:19.360
And what part's interesting
here?

00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:23.460
It's Ï  times
e^(-Ï /2).

00:43:23.460 --> 00:43:26.668
Okay, so it's some constant
times Ï  times the

00:43:26.668 --> 00:43:29.760
cosine of Î¸ times
e^(-Ï /2).

00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:31.340
You always have the
e^(-Ï /2);

00:43:31.340 --> 00:43:32.579
forget that.
 

00:43:32.579 --> 00:43:34.579
It just means it decays as you
go out.

00:43:34.579 --> 00:43:37.130
Now Ï  times
cos(Î¸).

00:43:37.130 --> 00:43:40.344
What does that mean?;
Ï ,

00:43:40.344 --> 00:43:45.664
which is this distance,
times the cos(Î¸),

00:43:45.664 --> 00:43:47.269
what is that?
 

00:43:47.269 --> 00:43:48.280
Russell?
 

00:43:48.280 --> 00:43:50.860
It's z.
 

00:43:50.860 --> 00:43:55.561
So I can simplify this a lot,
if I mix my metaphors between

00:43:55.561 --> 00:43:59.693
polar and Cartesian coordinates,
it's z times

00:43:59.693 --> 00:44:01.639
e^(-Ï /2).
 

00:44:01.639 --> 00:44:04.400
That's the 2p_z orbital.
 

00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:11.914
Now, can you guess what the
2p_x and the 2p_y

00:44:11.914 --> 00:44:13.469
look like?
 

00:44:13.469 --> 00:44:15.750
Can somebody guess the
2p_y?

00:44:15.750 --> 00:44:16.590
Josh?
 

00:44:16.590 --> 00:44:18.820
Student:  You replace
x with --

00:44:18.820 --> 00:44:19.909
Prof: Replace what?
 

00:44:19.909 --> 00:44:21.260
Student:  Replace
z with x.

00:44:21.260 --> 00:44:22.710
Prof: Replace z
with x,

00:44:22.710 --> 00:44:23.860
you get the 2p_x
orbital;

00:44:23.860 --> 00:44:27.032
replace z with y,
you get the 2p_y

00:44:27.032 --> 00:44:27.619
orbital.
 

00:44:27.619 --> 00:44:31.719
Pretty straightforward
functions.

00:44:31.719 --> 00:44:35.659
Now how about -- you've seen
pictures of p orbitals.

00:44:35.659 --> 00:44:38.813
Now that you know what the
functions look like,

00:44:38.813 --> 00:44:43.065
it's interesting to go back to
the pictures you've seen and see

00:44:43.065 --> 00:44:44.369
what they mean.
 

00:44:44.369 --> 00:44:48.389
How do they relate to the
actual formula?

00:44:48.389 --> 00:44:50.766
So you could plot -- remember,
it's three parts,

00:44:50.766 --> 00:44:53.143
an R function,
a Î˜ function,

00:44:53.143 --> 00:44:54.559
a Î¦ function.
 

00:44:54.559 --> 00:44:57.315
We could look at each of those
functions separately,

00:44:57.315 --> 00:44:58.289
if we wanted to.
 

00:44:58.289 --> 00:44:58.639
Okay?
 

00:44:58.639 --> 00:45:00.722
We've been talking about the
R function,

00:45:00.722 --> 00:45:01.719
how it would behave.
 

00:45:01.719 --> 00:45:03.728
But how would the
Î˜ function behave

00:45:03.728 --> 00:45:05.139
in this, cosine Î¸?
 

00:45:05.139 --> 00:45:08.641
So we'll do a polar plot that
shows the value of cosine

00:45:08.641 --> 00:45:11.820
Î¸ as a function of
Î¸.

00:45:11.820 --> 00:45:13.570
Everybody with me?
 

00:45:13.570 --> 00:45:16.989
Okay, so what is it when
Î¸ is zero;

00:45:16.989 --> 00:45:18.300
what's cosine of Î¸?
 

00:45:18.300 --> 00:45:18.780
Student:  One.
 

00:45:18.780 --> 00:45:19.409
Prof: One.
 

00:45:19.409 --> 00:45:22.708
Okay, so there it is,
and we'll put a point there,

00:45:22.708 --> 00:45:23.179
okay?
 

00:45:23.179 --> 00:45:26.409
Now let's go to + and -30°.
 

00:45:26.409 --> 00:45:31.690
Cosine is 0.86,
and we'll put points there.

00:45:31.690 --> 00:45:36.947
And let's go to 45Â°,
it's the âˆšÂ½,

00:45:36.947 --> 00:45:39.630
0.71, put points there.
 

00:45:39.630 --> 00:45:43.090
At 60°, it's ½;
put points there.

00:45:43.090 --> 00:45:48.210
What is it if it's 90°?
 

00:45:48.210 --> 00:45:50.159
If it's 90°,
the cosine is zero.

00:45:50.159 --> 00:45:51.940
So we got a point at the origin.
 

00:45:51.940 --> 00:45:52.409
Right?
 

00:45:52.409 --> 00:45:55.340
So you can see what the shape
is.

00:45:55.340 --> 00:45:59.396
What if you go the other
direction, what if you go beyond

00:45:59.396 --> 00:46:02.150
90°, what happens to the
cosine?

00:46:02.150 --> 00:46:02.630
Student:  It's negative.
 

00:46:02.630 --> 00:46:03.619
Prof: Changes sign.
 

00:46:03.619 --> 00:46:05.922
So you've got another circle
that's negative on the other

00:46:05.922 --> 00:46:06.210
side.
 

00:46:06.210 --> 00:46:07.530
So there's a p orbital.
 

00:46:07.530 --> 00:46:11.382
But I'm not showing the whole
p orbital,

00:46:11.382 --> 00:46:15.320
I'm just showing how the
angular part varies.

00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:17.775
So you've seen pictures like
that of p orbitals,

00:46:17.775 --> 00:46:19.550
which is the Î˜
function.

00:46:19.550 --> 00:46:23.360
Or I could square it,
in order to look at probability

00:46:23.360 --> 00:46:26.293
density, as a function of
Î¸,

00:46:26.293 --> 00:46:28.639
and it would look like that.
 

00:46:28.639 --> 00:46:31.159
So you've seen pictures more or
less like that.

00:46:31.159 --> 00:46:36.775
Or I could make a picture like
that, which is a contour plot

00:46:36.775 --> 00:46:41.061
showing how big it is,
on a slice, through the

00:46:41.061 --> 00:46:41.822
nucleus.
 

00:46:41.822 --> 00:46:42.869
Right?
 

00:46:42.869 --> 00:46:45.467
So it's Ï  times
e^(-Ï /2) times

00:46:45.467 --> 00:46:48.608
cos(Î¸);
that multiplied by a constant

00:46:48.608 --> 00:46:50.070
is the wavefunction.
 

00:46:50.070 --> 00:46:53.001
Okay, so you can see it's
positive up at the top,

00:46:53.001 --> 00:46:54.530
negative at the bottom.
 

00:46:54.530 --> 00:46:56.768
And let's look at it a little
bit.

00:46:56.768 --> 00:46:59.224
And, notice it doesn't depend
on Ï†,

00:46:59.224 --> 00:47:01.190
the angle of rotation around
here.

00:47:01.190 --> 00:47:03.987
So we can take that picture and
rotate it to give a

00:47:03.987 --> 00:47:05.610
three-dimensional dumbbell.
 

00:47:05.610 --> 00:47:07.289
Okay?
 

00:47:07.289 --> 00:47:11.139
We're just looking at one slice
here, in order to be explicit.

00:47:11.139 --> 00:47:14.070
Okay, now so there's a certain
point there that has a certain

00:47:14.070 --> 00:47:16.268
Ï  and a certain
Î¸,

00:47:16.268 --> 00:47:18.900
and therefore it has a certain
value.

00:47:18.900 --> 00:47:23.659
Now, let's find the maximum,
of that function.

00:47:23.659 --> 00:47:24.489
Okay?
 

00:47:24.489 --> 00:47:27.010
So first it depends on
cos(Î¸).

00:47:27.010 --> 00:47:30.000
What will Î¸ be in
order for this to be a maximum?

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:30.360
Student:  Zero.
 

00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:31.619
Prof: Zero.
 

00:47:31.619 --> 00:47:34.019
So it has to be along the axis.
 

00:47:34.019 --> 00:47:34.929
Okay?
 

00:47:34.929 --> 00:47:37.320
Now, so Î¸ has to
be equal to zero.

00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:40.407
Okay, now how do we find where
it's going to be maximum with

00:47:40.407 --> 00:47:41.768
respect to Ï ?
 

00:47:41.768 --> 00:47:44.306
We take the derivative with
respect to Ï ,

00:47:44.306 --> 00:47:45.449
set it equal to zero.
 

00:47:45.449 --> 00:47:48.335
So that's this,
or simplified that,

00:47:48.335 --> 00:47:51.670
or simplified that;
Ï =2.

00:47:51.670 --> 00:47:54.469
So there's the maximum.
 

00:47:54.469 --> 00:47:59.347
And if we put the constants in,
we could find the true

00:47:59.347 --> 00:48:03.670
probability density anywhere;
just plug in Î¸,

00:48:03.670 --> 00:48:05.510
plug in Ï ,
and square it,

00:48:05.510 --> 00:48:07.139
multiply it by the constant.
 

00:48:07.139 --> 00:48:10.882
That's the electron density at
any given, at the point you're

00:48:10.882 --> 00:48:11.880
talking about.
 

00:48:11.880 --> 00:48:14.972
Now, or you could have a
computer do it for you,

00:48:14.972 --> 00:48:18.001
and that's where we're indebted
to Dean Dauger,

00:48:18.001 --> 00:48:19.449
who's a physicist.
 

00:48:19.449 --> 00:48:22.467
He went to Occidental College
and actually wrote this program

00:48:22.467 --> 00:48:24.730
while he was there,
but then he got a Ph.D.

00:48:24.730 --> 00:48:27.563
at UCLA in Physics,
and he wrote this for

00:48:27.563 --> 00:48:29.760
physicists, but we'll use it.
 

00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:32.289
Okay, here's a picture of Dean
Dauger.

00:48:32.289 --> 00:48:34.170
He also juggles.
 

00:48:34.170 --> 00:48:37.467
And here's a picture of him at
an Apple Developer Conference,

00:48:37.467 --> 00:48:40.050
and he's juggling,
the guy on the left there.

00:48:40.050 --> 00:48:43.780
He also drops one of the pins,
he's not perfect.

00:48:43.780 --> 00:48:44.500
Okay.
 

00:48:44.500 --> 00:48:46.360
So this is his program.
 

00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:48.679
He's at the Apple Developer
Conference.

00:48:48.679 --> 00:48:51.539
It works only on an Apple,
so if you don't have an Apple,

00:48:51.539 --> 00:48:53.940
borrow somebody's Apple and
look at the program,

00:48:53.940 --> 00:48:55.369
because it's really fun.
 

00:48:55.369 --> 00:48:59.465
This is the screen of the
program, and I don't have time

00:48:59.465 --> 00:49:03.340
to take you through it now,
but you should try it.

00:49:03.340 --> 00:49:06.478
So look at the PowerPoint of
this on the next few slides to

00:49:06.478 --> 00:49:09.454
learn what all the different
information is that's being

00:49:09.454 --> 00:49:12.135
given here,
and the kinds of questions you

00:49:12.135 --> 00:49:12.679
can ask.
 

00:49:12.679 --> 00:49:15.369
There's a 1s orbital,
right?

00:49:15.369 --> 00:49:17.110
And it's as if the thing were
really --

00:49:17.110 --> 00:49:20.561
the electron were really
colored, and it's a picture of

00:49:20.561 --> 00:49:24.590
how it would actually look if
you could see electron density.

00:49:24.590 --> 00:49:27.190
But all, of course,
he's done is used fancy

00:49:27.190 --> 00:49:30.659
computer graphics to plot the
square of the wavefunction.

00:49:30.659 --> 00:49:31.280
Right?
 

00:49:31.280 --> 00:49:33.369
But it's a really nice program.
 

00:49:33.369 --> 00:49:35.070
We'll talk about this a little
more next time.

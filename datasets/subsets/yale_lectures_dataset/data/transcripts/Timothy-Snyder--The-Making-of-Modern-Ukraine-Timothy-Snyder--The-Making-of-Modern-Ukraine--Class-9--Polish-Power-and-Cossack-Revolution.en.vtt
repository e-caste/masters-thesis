00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.437
- Okay, greetings
everybody, happy Tuesday.

00:00:15.437 --> 00:00:19.620
You have an exam, not this Thursday,

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.560
but the one after that.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.540
It will be a 50 minute exam in this space.

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:32.540
You will have blue books.

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.160
Very exciting.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.912
The TFs and I are gonna
remember to get blue books.

00:00:39.912 --> 00:00:42.270
And if you have an
accommodation for this exam,

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.550
please make sure that
your TF knows about it

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:45.960
between now and then,

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.220
so we can make sure that everyone

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:49.800
is set up the way they need to be set up.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.210
The format will be very simple.

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.280
There'll be a shorter essay.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.300
There'll be a longer essay.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.880
There'll probably be some
IDs, maybe some dates.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.283
But nothing very confusing.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.010
Okay, any questions about the
practical side of this class?

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.060
The exam?

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.260
Sections?

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.163
Everything's good?

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:13.950
I was just waiting to see
how long it would take

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.420
for you guys to nod.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.420
I was like letting the blank stares go by,

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.130
waiting for you to realize you had to nod.

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.963
Okay, good.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.230
What we're gonna try to do today

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:30.230
is bring the Polish factor into our class.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.630
And this is a very important thing to do

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.980
because without the
Polish factor, no Ukraine,

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.040
no Ukraine as it exists today.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.880
I hope by now you've gotten
used to the idea that nations

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.330
are not vertical constructions,
which were born a long time,

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.693
and then continue continuously
over the same territory

00:01:51.693 --> 00:01:53.820
in the boring way that it's presented

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.250
to you in your school textbooks.

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.540
I hope you've gotten used to the idea

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.040
that nations are a result of
encounters of larger units

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.480
and things bouncing off each other,

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.953
and unexpected reactions
and counterreactions.

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:10.770
We've already worked through how

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.990
at the basis of Ukrainian history,

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.920
we have this encounter

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.620
between the Franks and the Byzantines,

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.200
with the Vikings kind of
sliding from one to the other.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.573
Without that encounter, no Ukraine.

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.680
We've then worked through
how in the 13th century there

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.530
was the progress of the
Teutonic Knights from the West,

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.070
the Mongols from the East,
and in that encounter,

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.440
Lithuania ends up controlling most

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.840
of what had been the territories of Rus.

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.310
Again, without that encounter,

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.760
no Ukraine as we understand it.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.980
We're now moving into another encounter,

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.190
the encounter between
Lithuania and Poland.

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.220
And in this encounter
between Lithuania and Poland,

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.730
Ukraine, for the first
time begins to emerge

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.550
as something like a distinct entity.

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.017
So at the end of this lecture,

00:02:58.017 --> 00:03:01.920
it should be pretty clear that
there will be the emergence

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.800
of some distinct Ukrainian
political features,

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:09.150
which are recognizable up to the present.

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.180
Now, I'm gonna give you just
a few things very abstractly

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.107
before I get into the historical part.

00:03:14.107 --> 00:03:17.190
We need Poland for a lot of reasons,

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.370
but very briefly, like telegraphically,

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.100
the things that are going to
come in from the Polish side

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.710
have to do with the West.

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:28.230
They have to do with the Franks,

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.250
the Holy Roman Empire,
Western Christianity, right?

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.980
Like in a way, when
Poland enters the story,

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.000
it's like a delayed, you
know, six centuries delayed,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.870
but it's delayed
encounter with the Franks,

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.520
the Frankish version of Europe,

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.560
with the Western Christian
version of Europe,

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.810
because Poland, as you'll remember,

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.490
converts to not Eastern,
but Western Christianity.

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:57.570
So from Poland, we are
going to get Catholicism,

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.930
an encounter with Catholicism,
with Roman Catholicism.

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.790
We're also going to get
the emergence of something

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.320
called Greek Catholicism,

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.072
which still exists in Ukraine today.

00:04:08.072 --> 00:04:12.750
From Poland we are going
to get the Polish language

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:17.100
and a Polish version of the Renaissance.

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.480
And from Poland, we're going
to get the idea of a republic.

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:25.680
It is a very important
idea, a very ambiguous idea.

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.600
A republic means a state,
which is for the public,

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:31.800
which sounds wonderful.

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.022
Republic, res publica,
rzeczpospolita in Polish,

00:04:35.022 --> 00:04:38.559
respublika, if you insist in Ukrainian.

00:04:38.559 --> 00:04:41.370
It means the common matter, right?

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.130
But it means the public,
the public matter.

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:45.930
But who is the public?

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.330
Is the tricky question
for republics, you know,

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:49.980
right down to and including the republic

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:53.070
in which we are inhabiting,
which we are inhabiting today.

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:56.370
So, if the republic is a state,

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:59.520
which is not for just a
king, not just for a monarch,

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.510
but it's for a public, who's the public?

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:05.160
Who's in and who's out?

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:09.600
That political question is
posed very powerfully in Poland.

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:13.860
As we're gonna see, it's gonna
be posed vis-a-vis Ukraine.

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:15.990
And in some sense, an attempt to answer

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:17.760
that question by the Cossacks

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.580
is where a clear national history,

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:25.110
or at least anticolonial
history of Ukraine begins.

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:27.240
So Poland has a structure,

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.880
and this is my very
last preliminary remark,

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.080
and then we're gonna dive in.

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:35.310
Poland has a structure which
is different from Muscovy.

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:36.720
So we're gonna see these points.

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:37.920
We're gonna see the contact

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:41.130
between Poland and Muscovy
over and over again.

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:43.050
But if you think of Muscovy

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:46.650
as being founded as a post-Mongol state

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:51.150
with a very centralized
vertical type of regime,

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:52.380
Poland is something else.

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:57.380
Poland is a horizontal
regime in which the nobles

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:00.990
are much more important than the monarch,

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:04.110
in which the nobles have
rights, unlike in Muscovy,

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:07.440
in which the nobles
rights increase over time.

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:09.090
And in which by the end of this lecture,

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:10.260
actually around the middle,

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.140
the nobles are actually
selecting the monarch

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:14.550
rather than the other way around.

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:16.659
In Muscovy, the monarch
selects the nobles.

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:19.860
In Poland, the the nobles
select the monarch.

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:24.020
And that's a very, very
different kind of setup.

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:29.020
And with this notion of a
republic and the notion of nobles

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:33.210
who belong to the republic
comes the idea of rights.

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:36.480
Again, not rights for everyone,

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:40.285
but rights for the people who
belong to the noble estate.

00:06:40.285 --> 00:06:44.070
That's a Polish notion.

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:45.840
We're gonna see how it emerges over time.

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:47.490
But again, you have to see the difference

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:50.460
between that and Muscovy where the notion

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:55.140
that anyone has rights is
really not present at all

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:57.123
until much, much, much later.

00:06:57.123 --> 00:07:01.110
And the Cassocks, the Ukrainian Cassocks

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:02.220
are gonna emerge in this story,

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:04.260
and who we saw a bit
of in the last lecture,

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.980
the Ukrainian Cassocks
are somewhere in between.

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:10.530
The Ukrainian Cassocks are
going to get their idea,

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:14.880
some ideas about rights from
the contact with Poland.

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:17.490
And the Cassocks in some
way are going to want to,

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:18.570
they're gonna be a group that wants

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:21.360
to get inside this system in order

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.520
to enjoy the rights of
being inside the system,

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:25.980
but are not going to be able to do so,

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:28.290
but are going to be able to rebel.

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:30.720
And that's where we're going to end, okay.

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:34.080
So let's, so, for the purposes of,

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:35.910
so you get the method, right?

00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:37.500
This is a class about Ukraine,

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:40.120
but there is no way to do national history

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:44.580
by just doing national history, right?

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:46.650
If you try to tell, so you
might have noticed this,

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:49.140
like you go to a party
and you meet a new person,

00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:50.130
and what do you do?

00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:53.580
You talk about yourself
the whole time, right?

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:55.530
And when you talk about your
yourself the whole time,

00:07:55.530 --> 00:07:56.370
what happens?

00:07:56.370 --> 00:07:59.100
The other person falls in
love with you instantly

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:01.500
and everything goes great, right?

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:03.540
So, national history is like that.

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:04.680
You can't just say,

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:07.140
oh, there's just me,
me, me, me, me, right?

00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:09.180
If you just say Ukraine,
Ukraine, Ukraine, Ukraine,

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:10.740
Ukraine, Ukraine, Ukraine, Ukraine,

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:13.080
I might get a lot of
like thumbs up, you know,

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:15.450
from like certain Ukrainian
nationalists or whatever.

00:08:15.450 --> 00:08:19.260
But, you can't make sense of yourself

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:20.820
without other people, right?

00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:23.100
And you can't make sense of
yourself without listening,

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:24.720
and you can't make sense
of who you really are

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:27.060
without understanding what
influences are coming in

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:28.710
from where and what circumstances.

00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:31.200
So if we're gonna get to Ukraine,

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:33.000
but if we're gonna understand the Ukraine

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.670
of the 16th, 17th, 18th centuries,

00:08:35.670 --> 00:08:37.080
we really have to fundamentally

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:38.670
understand the Polish system.

00:08:38.670 --> 00:08:40.507
So we're gonna work on the Polish system

00:08:40.507 --> 00:08:43.260
or the Polish-Lithuanian system, okay.

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.330
So, the first thing to know about Poland,

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:48.990
where I just left off, the
rise of the noble estate,

00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:51.434
very important historical
difference from Muscovy

00:08:51.434 --> 00:08:54.480
and from other countries
like France, for example.

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:56.746
The rise of the noble estate.

00:08:56.746 --> 00:09:00.360
The noble estate is in Poland,

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:05.100
first of all, very big,
about 10% of the population,

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:07.800
which means that by the
time the noble estate

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:09.900
has a parliament and can vote,

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:12.930
more people in Poland can vote
than in any other country.

00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:16.797
So it's a more representative
system than any other country

00:09:16.797 --> 00:09:20.340
until British parliamentary
reform in the 19th century.

00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:22.230
More people can vote in
Poland than anywhere else.

00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:25.650
10% by early modern
standards is a huge number

00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:29.068
to participate in politics, okay.

00:09:29.068 --> 00:09:30.660
So it's very large.

00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:34.200
By the 15th century, the
membership has been stabilized.

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:37.110
So all of these groups that are like,

00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:40.062
that are very selective, you know,

00:09:40.062 --> 00:09:42.000
you know what I'm talking about.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.160
You're at Yale, like all
these selective groups,

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:46.500
you know, that you can't
get in all those groups.

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:51.150
So all these groups at one
time were very open, right?

00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:53.250
Like, so the trick of it,
like all the things which used

00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:56.130
to be which are now exclusive
were once inclusive,

00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:57.210
maybe not all, okay?

00:09:57.210 --> 00:09:58.710
But you get the basic idea.

00:09:58.710 --> 00:10:00.930
Historically, there's
often a period where you

00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:04.170
can join something and
then that group decides,

00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:05.850
okay, no one can join anymore.

00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:08.130
The nobility in Poland
is an example of that.

00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:09.270
So in the 15th century,

00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:12.267
the nobility in Poland had
managed to define who it was.

00:10:12.267 --> 00:10:16.320
The nobility is gonna pass
on from father to son,

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:17.850
no one else is going to join.

00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:19.710
Membership is stabilized.

00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:23.108
And the nobility has by the
15th century at the latest,

00:10:23.108 --> 00:10:27.540
a sense of a common identity in Poland.

00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:31.290
Now, what happens in the Polish system

00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:33.630
is that the power of the nobility

00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:37.050
only ever ratchets upwards.

00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:39.690
It only ever goes upwards
until the 18th century

00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:41.790
when they have a constitution
and they break it.

00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:43.290
And they have a very interesting moment

00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:45.330
of political thought, which
goes on for a few years.

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:47.017
And then the Russians
come and it's all over.

00:10:47.017 --> 00:10:48.510
If this were a Polish history class,

00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:50.550
we'd spent a lot of time on that.

00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:52.080
I just spent 15 seconds.

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:53.820
So, but for now, what we need to know

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:55.980
is that the power of the
nobility ratchets upward.

00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:57.900
And there are logics to this.

00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:02.900
One logic is that the Grand
Dukes of Lithuania, okay?

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:05.490
So, oh yeah, the essence
of the Polish system

00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:09.060
is that they have a
Lithuanian monarch, right?

00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:09.930
You remember that, right?

00:11:09.930 --> 00:11:13.170
They have a Lithuanian
monarch Jogaila or Jagiello,

00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:18.170
from 1385 until until 1572.

00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:21.090
So for almost two full centuries,

00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:25.080
they are governed by a
Lithuanian dynasty, right?

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:26.670
So the, the greatest,

00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:29.790
or at least the most interesting
period of Polish history

00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:33.000
is when they had Lithuanian monarchs.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.920
This is very important
for our class, right?

00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:38.130
Because it's because there's
a Lithuanian connection

00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:40.920
for Poland that there's a
Ukrainian connection for Poland.

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:43.530
Because when Lithuania
and Poland come together,

00:11:43.530 --> 00:11:46.410
Lithuania controls most
of what is today Ukraine.

00:11:46.410 --> 00:11:48.390
So, it's through the monarch,

00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:50.940
it's through Jagiello and his descendants,

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:53.280
descendants, descendants
for almost 200 years

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:55.920
that Ukraine and Poland
are in the same state.

00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:58.950
It's through the body
of the Lithuanian ruler,

00:11:58.950 --> 00:12:01.239
but the Lithuanian Grand Duke,

00:12:01.239 --> 00:12:03.699
in order to become the Polish king

00:12:03.699 --> 00:12:06.537
had to make promises
to the nobility, okay?

00:12:06.537 --> 00:12:09.360
And so every time, I'm
simplifying a little bit

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:11.850
that basically every time
the Lithuanian ruler dies,

00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:15.060
the Lithuanian ruler then has
to go to the Polish nobility.

00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:16.830
They make tours, actually.

00:12:16.830 --> 00:12:18.630
They travel from castle to castle.

00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:20.010
It's not you imagine because of, you know,

00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:22.020
you imagine that the king has a big castle

00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:23.220
and everyone comes to him.

00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:24.270
That's a little bit later.

00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:25.920
These were actually itinerant monarchs.

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:28.380
They would, you know, you'd
travel from place to place.

00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:30.690
You'd go like seasonally,
you'd hunt with this person,

00:12:30.690 --> 00:12:32.310
you'd fish with this person,
and that's what you would do.

00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:34.560
You travel the entire
time if you were king.

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:35.400
It's kind of interesting.

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:38.070
And so they would have to campaign

00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:39.570
to become kings of Poland.

00:12:39.570 --> 00:12:40.403
And what do you do?

00:12:40.403 --> 00:12:42.090
What do you promise people?

00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:44.433
Well, you say things like,

00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:49.350
okay, if I agree to give you a privilege

00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:51.600
in exchange for taxes.

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:53.520
So there are no regular taxes.

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:55.260
Now think about how the
state's gonna operate.

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:56.520
There are no regular taxes.

00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:58.830
Every time a tax is
levied on the nobility,

00:12:58.830 --> 00:13:00.480
the monarch has to give them something.

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:02.310
But the nobility has a sense

00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:04.380
of its own interests and is smart.

00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:06.843
And unlike the monarch who's kind of a,

00:13:06.843 --> 00:13:08.700
it's in a one-off situation,

00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:10.260
the nobility is thinking long term.

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.300
And so what do you trade the taxes for?

00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:13.980
You trade them for rights.

00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:16.740
You say, okay, we'll
pay taxes as a one-off,

00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:20.310
but in exchange, we are gonna get rights

00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:22.800
and these rights last forever.

00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:24.480
And they're gonna last
forever because we're

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:26.040
gonna have pieces of paper

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:29.223
with beautiful cursive and wax, right?

00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:34.113
Okay, that's not really
why, but they did have that.

00:13:35.497 --> 00:13:37.560
But, you see the notion, you
see the logic here, right?

00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:41.021
And so those rights then
only accumulate over time.

00:13:41.021 --> 00:13:45.090
And so then there's another
logic to this, okay?

00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:49.110
The other logic to this
besides election is that there

00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:52.620
are a few very powerful families,

00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:56.250
most of them, Lithuanian
or Ukrainian, actually.

00:13:56.250 --> 00:14:00.180
A few powerful nobles
who are called magnates,

00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:03.180
M-A-G-N-A-T-E, magnates.

00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:05.880
Magnateria was the Polish
word for this group.

00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:09.883
That if you think oligarchy
today, you won't be far off.

00:14:09.883 --> 00:14:14.883
So, and the king would be
in many ways less powerful

00:14:14.970 --> 00:14:17.430
than these most powerful nobles

00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:20.700
who would tend to own
hundreds of thousands of acres

00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:22.860
and have tens of thousands of serfs

00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:24.990
and be able to raise private armies

00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:26.190
of their own when they wanted to.

00:14:26.190 --> 00:14:27.900
And so, if you're the king,

00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:31.470
you need to counterbalance
the force of these magnates,

00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:32.303
of these great nobles.

00:14:32.303 --> 00:14:33.136
And so what do you do?

00:14:33.136 --> 00:14:37.080
Again, you give rights to
the nobility as a whole.

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:38.790
You try to bring the lesser nobility,

00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:40.680
the middle nobility over to your side.

00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:44.700
And so in order to do
that, you give them rights.

00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:47.490
So some of these rights as
they accumulate over time,

00:14:47.490 --> 00:14:48.740
are listed on your sheet.

00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:54.870
There's the Czerwinsk Privilege of 1422,

00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:58.485
which is about property
rights, very familiar concept.

00:14:58.485 --> 00:15:00.750
And it's a big concept, right?

00:15:00.750 --> 00:15:03.000
Property rights is a very important thing.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.040
Again, remember the difference in Muscovy.

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:08.130
In Muscovy, if you die, I can just decide

00:15:08.130 --> 00:15:10.110
that your property is
gonna go to somebody else.

00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:11.010
I mean, you don't even have to die,

00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:12.480
but you don't have to do
me the courtesy of dying.

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:13.410
I can just decide.

00:15:13.410 --> 00:15:15.600
But if you die, you'll
only own the property

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:17.250
in a contingent way.

00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:20.040
Whereas in 1422, the Polish nobility

00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:21.690
is already arranged for something,

00:15:21.690 --> 00:15:25.709
which it looks very much like
property rights at Czerwinsk.

00:15:25.709 --> 00:15:29.640
1430, they get the right that they

00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:32.280
cannot be imprisoned for no reason.

00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:33.870
Again, you might be
thinking, or you might not

00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:35.100
be thinking depending
on where you come from,

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:36.030
what your background is.

00:15:36.030 --> 00:15:37.350
That doesn't seem like a big deal,

00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:39.920
but that's a very, very big deal.

00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:41.460
In the English tradition
that will be known

00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:43.050
later as habeas corpus,

00:15:43.050 --> 00:15:45.090
that you can't just imprison somebody

00:15:45.090 --> 00:15:46.710
without giving a reason.

00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:50.070
Again, the difference between
this and Muscovy is stark.

00:15:50.070 --> 00:15:53.430
So these basic rights
that you can have property

00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:55.770
and that your body can't
just be put behind bars

00:15:55.770 --> 00:15:59.640
for no reason, that
establishes a fundamental kind

00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:03.540
of political, let's
call it, dignity, okay.

00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:05.610
So, and then a third thing which happens,

00:16:05.610 --> 00:16:09.300
and this is under Casimir the Jagiellon.

00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:12.000
I think I listed these
characters on your sheet.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.740
Casimir the Jagiellon ruled

00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:16.143
in the middle end of the 15th century.

00:16:16.143 --> 00:16:21.143
He encouraged the lower nobility

00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:24.273
to create local parliaments.

00:16:25.290 --> 00:16:26.400
Very big deal.

00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:29.610
Because when you talk
about how this is something

00:16:29.610 --> 00:16:31.380
which is cool about the
early modern period.

00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:33.660
When you talk about how
there's like democracy

00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:36.300
or assemblies, you have
to look very carefully

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:37.980
to see what's meant by this.

00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:39.870
Because very often, and the Cossacks

00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:41.010
are a good example of this,

00:16:41.010 --> 00:16:44.430
very often when you say, okay,
there was popular approval,

00:16:44.430 --> 00:16:46.140
there was voting, there was an assembly,

00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:49.170
what's really meant is like,
one guy gets to stand up

00:16:49.170 --> 00:16:52.180
on a chair or at the top of a
palace, which is even cooler,

00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:55.950
and like, shout out what's gonna happen.

00:16:55.950 --> 00:16:58.200
And then ideally with a spear, you know,

00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:01.650
and then everyone else says, yeah, right?

00:17:01.650 --> 00:17:04.830
And so like, in this form
of democracy, you're like,

00:17:04.830 --> 00:17:07.860
your role is reduced to saying, yeah!

00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:09.330
You don't have to do that.

00:17:09.330 --> 00:17:12.042
Actually, you know, definitely
don't do that actually,

00:17:12.042 --> 00:17:14.940
'cause like, we'll all
regret it later if you do.

00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:19.940
But, so acclimation is one
form of participation, right?

00:17:19.950 --> 00:17:24.930
And traditionally, the king and
the royal council in Poland,

00:17:24.930 --> 00:17:27.270
in the capital, which
at the time was Krakow,

00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:29.400
they would announce a
decision and then there would

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:31.620
be like a lot of shaking
of spears and shouting.

00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:33.791
And that would be approval, right?

00:17:33.791 --> 00:17:38.791
But under Casimir the Jagiellonian,
the idea was that you can,

00:17:39.630 --> 00:17:42.840
you as the nobility can organize yourself

00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:45.900
into local parliaments,
which were called Sejmikis

00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:48.450
or dietines in English.

00:17:48.450 --> 00:17:53.040
Very awkward word, diet sounds
like a regimen of eating.

00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:55.230
But a diet is another
name for a parliament.

00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:56.670
And then the diminutive of a diet,

00:17:56.670 --> 00:17:59.130
a little diet is a dietine, okay?

00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:00.583
You definitely learned
something today, right?

00:18:00.583 --> 00:18:02.100
A dietine, so if you wanna
tell your friends, like,

00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:04.380
I'm just going on diet, only on Thursdays,

00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:05.520
you can call it dietine.

00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:07.017
And they'll be like,
wow, what's a dietine?

00:18:07.017 --> 00:18:08.820
And you can say, well, my
History of Ukraine class,

00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:10.990
I learned that under
Casimir the Jagiellon,

00:18:10.990 --> 00:18:14.280
the minor Polish nobility was
encouraged to organize itself

00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:17.603
into local assemblies,
which were called dietines.

00:18:17.603 --> 00:18:19.110
Okay, now you know, you'll never forget.

00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:23.583
So, but the, no, I don't plan these jokes.

00:18:25.765 --> 00:18:30.060
So, but this is important
because it's moving

00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:33.090
towards representation, right?

00:18:33.090 --> 00:18:35.430
Not just acclimation, but representation.

00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:39.750
And these dietines then
elect representatives

00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:42.720
who go to the central diet or in Polish,

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:45.000
very important word in Polish,

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:50.000
Lithuanian too, also
exist at Ukrainian, Sejm,

00:18:50.223 --> 00:18:51.330
that's the name of the parliament,

00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:53.160
the lower house of the
parliament, the Sejm.

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:57.840
And so if, you know, you
guys were all minor nobles

00:18:57.840 --> 00:18:58.740
in a certain region,

00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:00.720
you could elect one of you to go to the,

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:03.166
so then you actually do have something

00:19:03.166 --> 00:19:07.172
which is like representative democracy.

00:19:07.172 --> 00:19:10.350
And that's a step so then you
can discuss your interests

00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:11.190
over the course of the year.

00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:14.129
You send your representative
and you actually get to vote.

00:19:14.129 --> 00:19:16.515
The voting still had to be unanimous,

00:19:16.515 --> 00:19:18.750
which we'll talk about maybe later,

00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:19.920
that can pose a problem,

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:21.853
as the European Union sometimes notices.

00:19:21.853 --> 00:19:25.530
But, you had a vote,
you actually had a vote.

00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:27.839
You were, you were represented, okay.

00:19:27.839 --> 00:19:32.839
In foreign policy, three
questions for Poland.

00:19:32.850 --> 00:19:35.215
Very quickly, I just want you
to know about these things.

00:19:35.215 --> 00:19:40.215
Mazovia, Mazovia is the
central district of Poland.

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:45.440
It's where the current
capital of Poland, Warsaw is.

00:19:45.572 --> 00:19:48.330
Warsaw is not the historic
capital of Poland.

00:19:48.330 --> 00:19:50.380
The historic capital of Poland is Krakow.

00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:54.930
Warsaw becomes the capital
of Poland after 1569.

00:19:54.930 --> 00:19:57.900
Krakow is the capital
of Poland, historically.

00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:01.830
Mazovia is only added the Poland in 1526.

00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:04.920
So, the Dukes of Mazovia die out

00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:07.920
and Mazovia becomes
part of Poland in 1526.

00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:09.183
Okay. just so you know.

00:20:10.432 --> 00:20:12.150
Second thing I need you to know,

00:20:12.150 --> 00:20:15.303
and we'll return to these
guys in a couple of lectures,

00:20:16.410 --> 00:20:18.150
the Habsburgs.

00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:22.050
There's a very important
central European family

00:20:22.050 --> 00:20:24.690
called the Habsburgs
who are going to emerge

00:20:24.690 --> 00:20:28.710
and they're going to be in
competition with the Poles for,

00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:30.780
you know, only about half a millennium.

00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:35.610
And they are going to, in
general be making alliances

00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:37.050
with the Russians or later,

00:20:37.050 --> 00:20:41.352
with the Prussians against Poland.

00:20:41.352 --> 00:20:44.613
And as a result of this rivalry,

00:20:45.691 --> 00:20:50.691
we get these two very interesting
moments that define Poland

00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:56.760
as an East European and not
a Central European country.

00:20:56.760 --> 00:21:00.570
The first is very early,
we already talked about it,

00:21:00.570 --> 00:21:05.570
when the, the Polish king
Jadwiga marries Jagiello.

00:21:07.786 --> 00:21:10.200
Jadwiga's a she, she marries Jagiello

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:11.910
instead of marrying a Habsburg.

00:21:11.910 --> 00:21:14.670
We talked about that
a couple lectures ago.

00:21:14.670 --> 00:21:17.220
Because Jadwiga marries Jagiello

00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:18.930
instead of marrying a Habsburg,

00:21:18.930 --> 00:21:22.020
Poland then becomes an East
European country, right?

00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:23.370
Poland and Lithuania together

00:21:23.370 --> 00:21:26.130
instead of Poland and the
Habsburg are together.

00:21:26.130 --> 00:21:31.130
The second moment like
this is 1515 and 1526,

00:21:31.710 --> 00:21:35.550
the early 16th century,
when as part of an attempt

00:21:35.550 --> 00:21:37.830
to make peace with the Habsburgs,

00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:40.020
there is a complicated marriage deal,

00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:41.880
which I have to spend
basically a whole lecture

00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:42.990
explaining in my other class.

00:21:42.990 --> 00:21:44.190
And I'm not gonna do that now,

00:21:44.190 --> 00:21:47.893
I'm just gonna say
complicated marriage deal.

00:21:47.893 --> 00:21:52.893
The result of which is that a
Pole dies in a battle in 1526.

00:21:56.730 --> 00:21:59.190
And this is something you
never wanna have happen.

00:21:59.190 --> 00:22:02.790
His brother-in-law then
inherits all of his claims.

00:22:02.790 --> 00:22:07.530
And these include the claims
to Bohemia and Hungary,

00:22:07.530 --> 00:22:09.930
which from 1526 onward are

00:22:09.930 --> 00:22:13.260
at least theoretically part
of the Habsburg domain.

00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:17.160
So that's the next part of
Poland becoming an East European

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:21.153
rather than a Central
European power, okay.

00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:25.170
The third little thing in
foreign affairs that again,

00:22:25.170 --> 00:22:26.640
I just need you to note

00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:29.670
because it's gonna become important later,

00:22:29.670 --> 00:22:33.600
before we can get to,
you know, Angela Merkel,

00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:35.700
and you know, Willy Brandt,

00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:40.590
and Hitler, and the Second Reich,

00:22:40.590 --> 00:22:43.440
and the unification of Germany
and all of these nice things,

00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:45.210
we have to get to Prussia.

00:22:45.210 --> 00:22:49.140
Prussia is the bit, the little tiny bit,

00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:51.030
the little tiny German state originally,

00:22:51.030 --> 00:22:53.160
which eventually will grow and expand

00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:55.983
and unite Germany in January of 1871.

00:22:57.300 --> 00:22:59.532
Prussia at this time in the 16th century

00:22:59.532 --> 00:23:04.532
is a a little tiny state, which
Poland recognizes in 1563.

00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:14.970
And Poland accepts a family
called the Hohenzollerns.

00:23:14.970 --> 00:23:16.230
I didn't write that down.

00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:19.510
The Hohenzollerns will
be allowed to govern.

00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:29.010
That family is then going
to be the princes of Prussia

00:23:29.010 --> 00:23:31.140
then the kings of Prussia, and
then eventually they're going

00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:32.940
to be the rulers of Germany.

00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:35.490
It's under them that Germany
is going to be unified.

00:23:35.490 --> 00:23:38.790
So I just mention this because later on,

00:23:38.790 --> 00:23:40.530
Prussia is gonna take advantage of moments

00:23:40.530 --> 00:23:42.240
of Polish weakness to
become more important

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:43.560
to declare itself a kingdom,

00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:45.150
declare itself independent of Poland,

00:23:45.150 --> 00:23:46.560
and so on and so on and so on,

00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:48.690
until later in the 18th century,

00:23:48.690 --> 00:23:51.170
Prussia will take part
in partitioning Poland,

00:23:51.170 --> 00:23:53.970
and then Prussia will
become a great power.

00:23:53.970 --> 00:23:55.290
It will become Germany and so on.

00:23:55.290 --> 00:23:59.850
Okay, so that's Poland in domestic

00:23:59.850 --> 00:24:01.863
and in foreign policy, very briefly.

00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:06.060
What about the relationship
between Poland and Lithuania?

00:24:06.060 --> 00:24:07.350
This is also very important.

00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:09.690
When Poland and Lithuania come together,

00:24:09.690 --> 00:24:12.120
it raises the question
of what Lithuania is

00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:14.670
and how Lithuania is
different from Poland.

00:24:14.670 --> 00:24:17.402
On the one side, Lithuanian nobles

00:24:17.402 --> 00:24:21.150
take something from Poland,
which is the idea of rights,

00:24:21.150 --> 00:24:23.048
a pretty important thing to take.

00:24:23.048 --> 00:24:26.936
So the Polish noble clans adopt,

00:24:26.936 --> 00:24:29.850
join themselves with
Lithuanian noble families.

00:24:29.850 --> 00:24:32.700
And the Lithuanian noble
families take the idea

00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:33.720
that they have rights.

00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:36.753
Up until that point,
they had not had rights.

00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:42.810
But at the same time, Lithuania
remained a distinct state

00:24:42.810 --> 00:24:46.260
in the sense that you had
to be a Lithuanian to serve

00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:48.674
in office under the
Grand Duke of Lithuania.

00:24:48.674 --> 00:24:50.760
And here's an important one,

00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:53.681
which we have to remember
for the Cossacks later on.

00:24:53.681 --> 00:24:56.820
In order to own land in Lithuania,

00:24:56.820 --> 00:24:58.470
you had to be a Lithuanian.

00:24:58.470 --> 00:25:01.320
So, and remember Lithuania
at the time I'm talking about

00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:04.710
means not Lithuania, today's
Belaya Rus, all the way down

00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:07.080
into most of what's today's Ukraine.

00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:08.880
So in order to own land in those places,

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:12.690
you had to be Lithuanian, okay.

00:25:12.690 --> 00:25:17.050
So the encounter between
Poland and Lithuania

00:25:18.210 --> 00:25:20.400
is kind of a two way thing.

00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:25.230
A Lithuanian family is ruling
Poland for almost 200 years.

00:25:25.230 --> 00:25:26.490
Fine.

00:25:26.490 --> 00:25:28.920
The Lithuanians preserve the court

00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:30.300
of the Grand Duke in Vilnius

00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:32.100
and they have their own administration,

00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:36.093
they have their own
language of law, which is,

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:40.590
I'm gonna be so happy
if you guys know this.

00:25:40.590 --> 00:25:43.890
Chancery Slavonic, but you
took the last class, right?

00:25:43.890 --> 00:25:46.380
I'm outing you, okay.

00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:47.400
Chancery Slavonic.

00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:51.333
So, this would be a great
exam question, by the way.

00:25:52.650 --> 00:25:55.263
The Chancery Slavonic comes from where?

00:25:56.130 --> 00:25:58.050
Cyril and Methodius trying

00:25:58.050 --> 00:26:00.960
to convert the Moravians, failing,

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:05.280
their successors, taking
the language to Bulgaria,

00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:09.180
that language coming to Kyiv
as the language of religion.

00:26:09.180 --> 00:26:11.160
Kyivan Rus taking that language

00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:13.560
and turning it into a
language of politics and law.

00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:15.420
After the fall of Kyiv to the Mongols,

00:26:15.420 --> 00:26:17.400
that language migrates to north Vilnius.

00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:20.820
And so in this grand
circle, right, which lasts,

00:26:20.820 --> 00:26:22.710
you know, eight centuries or so,

00:26:22.710 --> 00:26:24.780
by the time the Lithuanian statutes

00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:26.730
are written in the 16th century,

00:26:26.730 --> 00:26:28.680
there are three statutes of Lithuania.

00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:30.270
And they are there in part

00:26:30.270 --> 00:26:32.820
to distinguish Lithuanian
law from Polish law.

00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:35.343
They're written in Chancery Slavonic,

00:26:36.330 --> 00:26:39.390
so the point is, this is an
inheritance from Kyiv, right?

00:26:39.390 --> 00:26:41.850
This is an inheritance from Rus.

00:26:41.850 --> 00:26:46.822
So, things are going both
ways, but in general,

00:26:46.822 --> 00:26:51.510
the high culture is
spreading from west to east.

00:26:51.510 --> 00:26:53.880
So people in Poland are
not learning Lithuanian,

00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:56.280
but people, nobles in Lithuania

00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:59.310
are learning the Polish language.

00:26:59.310 --> 00:27:03.780
And this is a time in which
the Polish language is very,

00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:06.570
is flowering thanks to the Renaissance

00:27:06.570 --> 00:27:09.720
and is also a powerful
language of disputation,

00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:11.370
thanks to the Reformation.

00:27:11.370 --> 00:27:14.300
So the Polish language
becomes the language

00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:17.010
of the literate people in
the Grand Duchy of Lithuania,

00:27:17.010 --> 00:27:19.560
which includes, again,
Belaya Rus and Ukraine.

00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:22.530
By about, as far as we can tell,

00:27:22.530 --> 00:27:26.220
by about 1640 most serious discussions

00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:28.920
in what's now Ukraine among theologians,

00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:32.760
educated people were taking
place in the Polish language.

00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:37.760
Okay, so this brings us to
the attitude towards Moscow.

00:27:40.537 --> 00:27:45.447
So in Lithuania, the
attitude towards Moscow

00:27:47.070 --> 00:27:50.130
was necessarily different
than in Poland, why?

00:27:50.130 --> 00:27:52.530
Because Lithuania was a
direct neighbor of Moscow.

00:27:52.530 --> 00:27:54.330
The Lithuanians were
more or less constantly

00:27:54.330 --> 00:27:57.510
fighting wars with
Moscow, the Lithuanians,

00:27:57.510 --> 00:28:02.510
most of them were Orthodox, and
very often they were related

00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:04.470
to people on the other side.

00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:06.510
And the Lithuanians, until the time,

00:28:06.510 --> 00:28:07.590
many Lithuanians at least

00:28:07.590 --> 00:28:09.030
until the time of Ivan the Terrible

00:28:09.030 --> 00:28:12.210
had the idea that we can make a deal

00:28:12.210 --> 00:28:13.950
with the Muscovites, right?

00:28:13.950 --> 00:28:15.480
The Poles might not be involved.

00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:18.488
We can make some kind of separate
deal with the Muscovites.

00:28:18.488 --> 00:28:22.560
When this ends and when
Poland and the Lithuania

00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:26.020
are brought together is
with Ivan the Terrible

00:28:26.020 --> 00:28:29.070
and the Livonian wars.

00:28:29.070 --> 00:28:30.570
I think I mentioned this
a couple of lectures ago.

00:28:30.570 --> 00:28:33.900
It's a very interesting thing
to think about right now.

00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:36.720
When Russia is fighting a war in Europe,

00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:38.640
which has had this surprising consequence

00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:41.216
of bringing European powers together.

00:28:41.216 --> 00:28:43.560
And everyone is making
historical analogies.

00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:45.480
Is this like the first World War?

00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:46.890
Is it like the second World War?

00:28:46.890 --> 00:28:48.450
You know, is it like 1917?

00:28:49.937 --> 00:28:51.300
Is it like the Russian Revolution?

00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:54.390
But, one analogy, which
people aren't making a lot,

00:28:54.390 --> 00:28:55.800
but which you guys are
gonna be able to make

00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:57.834
and I'm sure you will,
like, at your next party

00:28:57.834 --> 00:28:59.700
when you're talking about yourself.

00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:00.840
I wanna tell you all about me.

00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:02.313
I know about the 1560s.

00:29:06.195 --> 00:29:09.120
In the Livonian Wars, that's
when Ivan the Terrible,

00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:12.810
as you'll remember, that's
when he overreaches, right?

00:29:12.810 --> 00:29:13.950
He has that fateful thing

00:29:13.950 --> 00:29:15.660
that you don't wanna
do, which is overreach.

00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:18.693
And the problem with overreaching
is that you never know,

00:29:18.693 --> 00:29:20.580
you never know until you've done

00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:21.540
and then until it's too late.

00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:23.520
Like that's the tragedy of overreach.

00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:24.540
Like, should I talk about myself

00:29:24.540 --> 00:29:26.070
for five minutes or 10 minutes?

00:29:26.070 --> 00:29:28.260
Oh no, it should have been five minutes!

00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:30.960
So he overreaches in the Livonian Wars,

00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:32.460
and this has the consequence

00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:35.310
of bringing Lithuania and Poland together.

00:29:35.310 --> 00:29:36.720
So we're now gonna tell this story not

00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:38.190
from the Muscovite point of view,

00:29:38.190 --> 00:29:40.680
but from the Lithuanian
Polish point of view.

00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:44.160
The Livonian Wars were
the great opportunity

00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:48.090
for probably the greatest
Polish King, who was Zygmunt II.

00:29:48.090 --> 00:29:50.197
Sigismund II, Zygmunt II,

00:29:50.197 --> 00:29:53.520
who ruled technically from
1520 when he was crowned

00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:56.941
as a boy until 1572.

00:29:56.941 --> 00:30:00.873
So Zigmunt II Grand Duke of
Lithuania, king of Poland,

00:30:01.890 --> 00:30:06.890
he is the big winner in the Livonian Wars,

00:30:07.170 --> 00:30:09.942
whereas Ivan is the big loser.

00:30:09.942 --> 00:30:11.606
So Livonia, you'll remember.

00:30:11.606 --> 00:30:13.890
it sounds like a fairy tale name, right?

00:30:13.890 --> 00:30:17.013
Livonia, it's basically
Latvia Estonia today.

00:30:18.180 --> 00:30:21.510
The Livonian state is the successor

00:30:21.510 --> 00:30:24.900
of the Teutonic state in the Baltic.

00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:27.180
Livonia exists as a German-speaking state

00:30:27.180 --> 00:30:29.850
because of the Teutonic Knights.

00:30:29.850 --> 00:30:33.390
These are Baltic territories,
which they do seize,

00:30:33.390 --> 00:30:35.910
where the Lithuanians don't stop them,

00:30:35.910 --> 00:30:39.873
they then convert to
Protestantism as many Germans did.

00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:42.540
We have to remember, I know it's tough,

00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:43.710
but like while I'm talking,

00:30:43.710 --> 00:30:45.960
the Renaissance and the
Reformation are taking place,

00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:48.510
you know, not in the background,
but also in the foreground.

00:30:48.510 --> 00:30:50.721
So they convert to Protestantism

00:30:50.721 --> 00:30:54.078
and the Grandmaster of the Livonian Order

00:30:54.078 --> 00:30:56.670
asks for Polish protection.

00:30:56.670 --> 00:30:59.760
And then they also ask in the
north for Swedish protection,

00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:02.058
which leads to this very complicated war.

00:31:02.058 --> 00:31:04.620
But from the Polish point of view,

00:31:04.620 --> 00:31:06.090
what happens is that this

00:31:06.090 --> 00:31:07.950
brings Poland and Lithuania together.

00:31:07.950 --> 00:31:09.900
And the Livonian Wars,
the Lithuanian nobles

00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:11.730
understand we have to fight Muscovy.

00:31:11.730 --> 00:31:13.170
We're not gonna be making a deal.

00:31:13.170 --> 00:31:17.760
And their Grand Duke, also
the Polish king Zygmunt II

00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:19.620
goes to the Polish parliament and says,

00:31:19.620 --> 00:31:21.960
we need to fight a war,
we need to raise taxes.

00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:24.630
It's an interesting
moment because he appears,

00:31:24.630 --> 00:31:26.250
this is a very kind of
modern political moment.

00:31:26.250 --> 00:31:30.450
He appears in Polish
dress, right, in order.

00:31:30.450 --> 00:31:32.460
So how you dress and
what language you speak,

00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:33.293
very important.

00:31:33.293 --> 00:31:35.160
He appears in Polish
dress to make the speech

00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:36.600
about how we have to go to the field.

00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:37.893
We have to raise taxes.

00:31:38.730 --> 00:31:41.460
Oh, what is, okay, this
one is really hard.

00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:43.530
All right, although I
just dropped a keyword.

00:31:43.530 --> 00:31:45.063
What did he normally wear?

00:31:50.850 --> 00:31:52.763
What did he normally wear, do you think?

00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:56.090
- [Student] Lithuanian clothes.

00:31:56.090 --> 00:31:58.290
- Okay, 200 years ago, that was right.

00:31:58.290 --> 00:32:00.870
Like that's where they,
when Jagiello was showed up,

00:32:00.870 --> 00:32:03.030
he was like, he was wearing fur

00:32:03.030 --> 00:32:05.223
and like unmistakably Lithuanian.

00:32:08.100 --> 00:32:10.383
What was cool in the 1560s?

00:32:11.250 --> 00:32:12.210
Yeah.

00:32:12.210 --> 00:32:15.000
- [Student] Well, in
Polish, but basically it's

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:16.500
something they got as a contribution

00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:18.027
from Turks and the Macedonians.

00:32:18.027 --> 00:32:18.860
- Okay.

00:32:18.860 --> 00:32:20.009
- [Student] In Turkish fashion.

00:32:20.009 --> 00:32:22.020
- All right, in combat, that's true.

00:32:22.020 --> 00:32:23.832
And we'll talk about that.

00:32:23.832 --> 00:32:27.483
He was wearing Italianate
Renaissance costume.

00:32:28.350 --> 00:32:29.760
That's what he normally wore.

00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:32.520
He normally wore Italian
Renaissance costume.

00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:35.820
That's what he, you know, puffy hat.

00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:36.900
That's what he normally wore.

00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:40.350
So on, exception because this
was the Renaissance, right?

00:32:40.350 --> 00:32:41.940
I realize we hadn't enough
time to get into all of this,

00:32:41.940 --> 00:32:43.800
but this was the Renaissance.

00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:44.640
This was the Renaissance.

00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:48.663
His mother was Italian, his
court was largely Italian.

00:32:49.860 --> 00:32:52.650
He normally wore it as
one did at the time,

00:32:52.650 --> 00:32:54.960
he normally looked Italian, okay?

00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:57.580
So with the Zygmunt II
dresses in Polish garb,

00:32:57.580 --> 00:33:01.140
calls parliament in order
to raise taxes, right?

00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:03.240
So, remember this is the
way it works back then.

00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:04.426
Parliament shows up.

00:33:04.426 --> 00:33:06.330
What are you gonna give me?

00:33:06.330 --> 00:33:08.370
We're gonna give you
some land after a war.

00:33:08.370 --> 00:33:10.260
What else are you gonna give me?

00:33:10.260 --> 00:33:12.510
Okay, I'm gonna give you a bunch of land

00:33:12.510 --> 00:33:13.710
that was also part of the deal.

00:33:13.710 --> 00:33:16.350
Zygmunt II gave the
nobles a bunch of land.

00:33:16.350 --> 00:33:17.490
What else are you gonna give me?

00:33:17.490 --> 00:33:19.394
Okay, we'll let you elect the kings.

00:33:19.394 --> 00:33:21.570
Promise, you can elect the next king,

00:33:21.570 --> 00:33:22.650
because theoretically they've been

00:33:22.650 --> 00:33:23.850
electing kings for a long time.

00:33:23.850 --> 00:33:25.470
But somehow it always worked out

00:33:25.470 --> 00:33:27.060
that even though there was an election,

00:33:27.060 --> 00:33:28.437
it was always a Jagiello.

00:33:28.437 --> 00:33:29.940
It was like one Jagiello
after another for,

00:33:29.940 --> 00:33:31.576
so, you know, for 200 years.

00:33:31.576 --> 00:33:34.320
Okay, fine, next time you
can really elect the king.

00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:36.000
And that actually the
next time they really

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:37.620
did elect the king,
which is another chapter

00:33:37.620 --> 00:33:38.580
which we're gonna get to.

00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:42.930
So Zygmunt II, this is like
a wonderful story of like,

00:33:42.930 --> 00:33:46.890
of a king achieving,
overcoming his own youth.

00:33:46.890 --> 00:33:49.740
In his youth, he had like
various Lithuanian romances,

00:33:49.740 --> 00:33:51.870
and there was a Lithuanian prince

00:33:51.870 --> 00:33:53.400
who thought he had 'em in his back pocket

00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:56.636
because of these romances,
but no, Zygmunt II

00:33:56.636 --> 00:33:58.800
gathers the Lithuanians and the Poles,

00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:00.180
goes to the battlefield,

00:34:00.180 --> 00:34:02.670
they win the Livonian Wars, basically.

00:34:02.670 --> 00:34:05.923
Poland expands northward into Livonia,

00:34:05.923 --> 00:34:10.023
and Lithuania takes
part, Poland takes part.

00:34:11.339 --> 00:34:15.583
And in trying to then establish
a new political equilibrium,

00:34:16.530 --> 00:34:20.190
Zygmunt II does the thing which begins

00:34:20.190 --> 00:34:22.200
to define what Ukraine is going to be.

00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:25.860
And that is that Zygmunt II in something

00:34:25.860 --> 00:34:30.860
called the Union of Lublin,
1569 recreates Poland-Lithuania,

00:34:32.781 --> 00:34:34.740
not as a personal union.

00:34:34.740 --> 00:34:36.990
So for 200 years, it's
been a personal union.

00:34:36.990 --> 00:34:39.440
You're the Grand Duke and
you're the Polish King.

00:34:41.490 --> 00:34:43.530
Now it's gonna be a constitutional union.

00:34:43.530 --> 00:34:46.197
So by definition, the leader of Poland

00:34:46.197 --> 00:34:48.075
and the leader of Lithuania,

00:34:48.075 --> 00:34:51.330
you're gonna be the same
person constitutionally, okay?

00:34:51.330 --> 00:34:53.970
And that person's gonna be elected, great.

00:34:53.970 --> 00:34:55.230
And we're gonna call it a republic.

00:34:55.230 --> 00:34:57.830
It's the Polish-Lithuanian
Republic, Rzeczpospolita.

00:35:00.124 --> 00:35:00.957
But, and here's the but,

00:35:00.957 --> 00:35:03.243
which is crucial to Ukrainian history.

00:35:04.290 --> 00:35:06.570
Zygmunt II in the Union of Lublin,

00:35:06.570 --> 00:35:08.340
and it seems like a footnote to the Poles

00:35:08.340 --> 00:35:09.720
and also sometimes the Lithuanians,

00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:12.150
but for the Ukrainians
is not a footnote at all.

00:35:12.150 --> 00:35:13.891
In the Union of Lublin,

00:35:13.891 --> 00:35:17.250
it's still a Polish Lithuanian state.

00:35:17.250 --> 00:35:19.260
But the border between
Poland and Lithuania

00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:21.090
is changed drastically,

00:35:21.090 --> 00:35:24.122
such that now the Ukrainian part

00:35:24.122 --> 00:35:26.580
is part of the Polish crown,

00:35:26.580 --> 00:35:30.000
and Lithuania is much
smaller than it was before.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:31.590
Why is this so important?

00:35:31.590 --> 00:35:35.402
This is hugely important
because it means that suddenly,

00:35:35.402 --> 00:35:39.690
no longer is there
Lithuanian law in Ukraine,

00:35:39.690 --> 00:35:42.180
but now there is Polish law in Ukraine.

00:35:42.180 --> 00:35:44.973
So just to give you a very
important central example.

00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:50.520
Now, Polish nobles can own
land in Ukraine, which is,

00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:53.250
it's like the opening of
the frontier, basically.

00:35:53.250 --> 00:35:54.780
In fact, it is like an
opening in the frontier

00:35:54.780 --> 00:35:58.470
because these are rich
lands, agricultural lands.

00:35:58.470 --> 00:36:01.020
And again, I know this stuff
is happening in the background

00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:04.710
and is tough, but this is
also the age of discovery,

00:36:04.710 --> 00:36:05.940
the age of exploration.

00:36:05.940 --> 00:36:09.030
It's the first globalization,
the 16th century,

00:36:09.030 --> 00:36:10.818
and all that grain that you can raise

00:36:10.818 --> 00:36:13.050
by enserfing Ukrainian peasants,

00:36:13.050 --> 00:36:14.910
you can then sell on the world market

00:36:14.910 --> 00:36:16.560
and get gold and silver.

00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:19.998
So suddenly, it's like a globalization,

00:36:19.998 --> 00:36:22.530
which involves the Ukrainian steppe.

00:36:22.530 --> 00:36:24.900
Okay, and so anyway, but I wanna be clear,

00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:27.810
there's now a new line
which didn't exist before.

00:36:27.810 --> 00:36:29.253
There was never a line.

00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:32.595
If you imagine the northern
border of Ukraine now,

00:36:32.595 --> 00:36:37.110
Ukrainian Belaya Rus, that
line was never there before.

00:36:37.110 --> 00:36:39.870
As of 1569, there is
something like that line.

00:36:39.870 --> 00:36:42.960
As of 1569, the notions
of Ukraine and Belaya Rus

00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:44.220
start to make sense.

00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:46.588
That old territory,
which is all part of Rus,

00:36:46.588 --> 00:36:49.830
now will follow two distinct routes.

00:36:49.830 --> 00:36:52.137
The Belaya Russian part will
have more to do with Lithuania.

00:36:52.137 --> 00:36:56.040
The Ukrainian part will
have more to do with Poland,

00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:57.450
dramatically to do with Poland.

00:36:57.450 --> 00:36:59.640
Okay, what's all the drama?

00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:01.110
What's all the drama?

00:37:01.110 --> 00:37:03.663
Number one, the drama is language.

00:37:05.430 --> 00:37:07.260
The drama is language.

00:37:07.260 --> 00:37:08.996
In the Renaissance,

00:37:08.996 --> 00:37:11.578
there's something called
the language question,

00:37:11.578 --> 00:37:16.050
which is fateful for,
you know, many of us.

00:37:16.050 --> 00:37:18.060
The written language question is,

00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:23.060
do you keep using Latin or
do you take the vernacular

00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:24.660
and you turn the vernacular

00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:26.700
into a language of
literature and education?

00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:28.380
So up until that time, it was normal

00:37:28.380 --> 00:37:31.242
for universities to be using Latin,

00:37:31.242 --> 00:37:34.260
and it was normal to write, even novels,

00:37:34.260 --> 00:37:35.940
correspondence in Latin.

00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:39.925
But in the language question,
which was answered by Dante,

00:37:39.925 --> 00:37:43.350
and the answer was, make up
Italian, create in Italian,

00:37:43.350 --> 00:37:45.660
which is, it sounds easy
when I say it that way,

00:37:45.660 --> 00:37:47.280
but it's actually an
extraordinary achievement

00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:49.410
to take a vernacular and
turn it to a written language

00:37:49.410 --> 00:37:51.000
and then have that version
of the written language

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:52.140
be accepted by everyone.

00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:53.820
It's an extraordinary thing, right?

00:37:53.820 --> 00:37:56.021
In England, it's largely
a matter of Shakespeare

00:37:56.021 --> 00:37:59.100
or the King James Bible.

00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:02.040
But, you know, so the language question,

00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:03.420
what's the answer, right?

00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:05.310
So some places it might seem
more or less obvious, like,

00:38:05.310 --> 00:38:07.946
okay, you take a version of
French or version of English,

00:38:07.946 --> 00:38:10.890
but in Ukraine, what's the answer?

00:38:10.890 --> 00:38:13.380
What's the answer to the
language question in Ukraine?

00:38:13.380 --> 00:38:14.820
You have old church Slavonic,

00:38:14.820 --> 00:38:16.380
which is still around somewhere.

00:38:16.380 --> 00:38:18.900
You have the Ukrainian vernacular,

00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:21.203
which is perfectly well exists.

00:38:21.203 --> 00:38:23.640
And you have Polish.

00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:25.410
And all these things are possible, right?

00:38:25.410 --> 00:38:27.900
These are all possible answers
to the language question.

00:38:27.900 --> 00:38:29.040
But the way it's answered,

00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:30.570
the actual answer to the language question

00:38:30.570 --> 00:38:34.020
in Ukraine is Polish, as I said before.

00:38:34.020 --> 00:38:36.990
So people start writing in a language

00:38:36.990 --> 00:38:39.420
which isn't an ancient
language, which is not Greek,

00:38:39.420 --> 00:38:42.750
it's not old church Slavonic,
it's not Latin, it's Polish.

00:38:42.750 --> 00:38:45.240
But this answer to the language question

00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:49.290
is fundamentally different from
the other answers elsewhere.

00:38:49.290 --> 00:38:53.280
If the answer to the language
question in Poland is Polish,

00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:55.440
that means suddenly everybody
has the same, not everybody,

00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:57.390
but many people have the same language,

00:38:57.390 --> 00:38:58.590
top to bottom, right?

00:38:58.590 --> 00:38:59.910
The nobles and the peasants

00:38:59.910 --> 00:39:01.470
can be speaking the same language.

00:39:01.470 --> 00:39:02.490
In France, the same.

00:39:02.490 --> 00:39:03.720
England, the same,

00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:05.100
Germany the same.

00:39:05.100 --> 00:39:06.780
But in Ukraine, if the answer

00:39:06.780 --> 00:39:09.120
to the language question is Polish,

00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:12.240
then suddenly roughly one to two,

00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:14.790
maybe three percent of the
population has one language,

00:39:14.790 --> 00:39:19.230
and 97% and 98% has another.

00:39:19.230 --> 00:39:22.200
That's a very different social outcome,

00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:23.100
very different social outcome.

00:39:23.100 --> 00:39:25.050
So the language question
always gets answered

00:39:25.050 --> 00:39:26.730
in terms of the modern language,

00:39:26.730 --> 00:39:27.960
but it doesn't always get answered

00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:29.460
in terms of the vernacular, right?

00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:31.140
So that's one thing which is very dramatic

00:39:31.140 --> 00:39:31.973
about the situation.

00:39:31.973 --> 00:39:34.800
Secondly, which is very
dramatic, is religion.

00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:36.690
So again, while I'm telling you

00:39:36.690 --> 00:39:39.000
about the Czerwinsk Privilege,

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:40.789
while I'm telling you
about these Polish details,

00:39:40.789 --> 00:39:43.200
the Reformation is going on.

00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:45.390
And the Reformation is
going on also in Poland.

00:39:45.390 --> 00:39:48.060
And in Poland in the 16th century,

00:39:48.060 --> 00:39:50.850
most of the nobility
actually goes Protestant.

00:39:50.850 --> 00:39:52.080
So like during the period,

00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:53.910
which the Poles find themselves
find the most interesting,

00:39:53.910 --> 00:39:56.280
which is the 16th century,
they had a Lithuanian dynasty,

00:39:56.280 --> 00:39:58.020
and they had a Protestant parliament,

00:39:58.020 --> 00:39:59.640
which is just worth remembering,

00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:01.390
small talk for your Polish friends.

00:40:02.430 --> 00:40:06.690
And in Ukraine, you also
have the Reformation.

00:40:06.690 --> 00:40:09.870
But in the Reformation in Ukraine

00:40:09.870 --> 00:40:12.840
is going to involve Protestants,

00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:15.630
it's going to involve Catholics
in the Counter-Reformation,

00:40:15.630 --> 00:40:18.690
but the population is
mostly Orthodox, right?

00:40:18.690 --> 00:40:21.450
This is Rus, this is Eastern Christianity.

00:40:21.450 --> 00:40:24.480
So you have a Reformation
and a Counter-Reformation,

00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:27.090
which are overlaying onto this population,

00:40:27.090 --> 00:40:28.440
which is mainly Orthodox.

00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:30.870
And the Reformation
and Counter-Reformation

00:40:30.870 --> 00:40:32.430
are gonna go through
all kinds of gymnastics.

00:40:32.430 --> 00:40:33.870
And the elite families are gonna,

00:40:33.870 --> 00:40:35.100
they're first gonna go Protestant,

00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:36.450
and then they're gonna go Catholic.

00:40:36.450 --> 00:40:38.082
And it's all very interesting.

00:40:38.082 --> 00:40:40.140
But at the end of the
day, what happens is that

00:40:40.140 --> 00:40:41.894
after about three generations of this,

00:40:41.894 --> 00:40:44.220
you're going to have a top layer

00:40:44.220 --> 00:40:47.940
of the Ukrainian population,
generally the richest nobles.

00:40:47.940 --> 00:40:51.088
The people who also own a lot
of land and a lot of serfs,

00:40:51.088 --> 00:40:52.863
they're gonna be Roman Catholic,

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:55.020
and they're also gonna be the same people

00:40:55.020 --> 00:40:56.760
who are speaking Polish, right?

00:40:56.760 --> 00:40:58.770
So that's the second thing which happens.

00:40:58.770 --> 00:41:01.263
There's a new religious question.

00:41:01.263 --> 00:41:04.380
And then the final thing
which is going to happen,

00:41:04.380 --> 00:41:07.683
which I've already suggested,
is the social question.

00:41:09.330 --> 00:41:13.110
Suddenly, Poles can own land in Ukraine.

00:41:13.110 --> 00:41:15.420
So if you're an ambitious Polish noble

00:41:15.420 --> 00:41:18.570
with maybe not enough
land, you go east, right?

00:41:18.570 --> 00:41:22.530
And you go east with European
land management practices,

00:41:22.530 --> 00:41:24.330
and you go east with your

00:41:24.330 --> 00:41:27.480
almost certainly Jewish
manager, right, and his family,

00:41:27.480 --> 00:41:31.747
and you go off and you
colonize and you make money.

00:41:31.747 --> 00:41:35.310
And then the local Ukrainians
who see what you were doing,

00:41:35.310 --> 00:41:36.750
the local Ukrainian nobles,

00:41:36.750 --> 00:41:38.550
they immediately copy what you're doing.

00:41:38.550 --> 00:41:39.930
They also insert their peasants.

00:41:39.930 --> 00:41:41.730
They also take a surplus.

00:41:41.730 --> 00:41:44.310
They also sell it up to the
Vistula River into Europe

00:41:44.310 --> 00:41:46.456
and the wider world if they can.

00:41:46.456 --> 00:41:51.456
And so the result of this is that you have

00:41:51.780 --> 00:41:55.650
suddenly a population
which is ever less free,

00:41:55.650 --> 00:41:58.380
which enserfed, which
is bound to the land.

00:41:58.380 --> 00:42:00.810
And you have a noble
class, which is small.

00:42:00.810 --> 00:42:02.460
So I said in Poland as a whole,

00:42:02.460 --> 00:42:04.842
10% of the population is noble, yes.

00:42:04.842 --> 00:42:06.540
In some places, more.

00:42:06.540 --> 00:42:09.090
Mazovia, it's like 25%, right?

00:42:09.090 --> 00:42:11.070
So basically in Mazovia,
if you're not a noble,

00:42:11.070 --> 00:42:12.360
you have some explaining to do.

00:42:12.360 --> 00:42:16.503
But, in Ukraine, 1%, 2%, okay?

00:42:17.964 --> 00:42:22.440
So 1%, 2% of the population owns the land,

00:42:24.510 --> 00:42:27.172
controls much of the
rest of the population,

00:42:27.172 --> 00:42:31.050
largely speaks Polish, and
is largely Roman Catholic.

00:42:31.050 --> 00:42:35.310
And that whole transformation
takes place very quickly.

00:42:35.310 --> 00:42:40.310
Three generations from
about 1569 to the 1640s.

00:42:40.380 --> 00:42:42.300
That's the Polish connection.

00:42:42.300 --> 00:42:45.540
So, on the one side Polish connection,

00:42:45.540 --> 00:42:46.743
very beautiful, right?

00:42:48.300 --> 00:42:51.330
The Polish connection means variety.

00:42:51.330 --> 00:42:54.030
The Polish connection
means the Renaissance.

00:42:54.030 --> 00:42:56.130
The Polish connection means a whole lot

00:42:56.130 --> 00:42:58.680
of really interesting
theological disputes.

00:42:58.680 --> 00:43:01.890
The Polish connection means
that the Ukrainian clerics

00:43:01.890 --> 00:43:05.291
start their own academies and use Greek,

00:43:05.291 --> 00:43:07.740
force themselves to learn
Greek, which they'd been,

00:43:07.740 --> 00:43:09.510
you know, lazy about for
the previous six centuries.

00:43:09.510 --> 00:43:11.850
But now they do it and they learn Latin,

00:43:11.850 --> 00:43:14.010
and they learn Polish,
and they learn French.

00:43:14.010 --> 00:43:17.413
And you know, and they become
some most interesting debaters

00:43:17.413 --> 00:43:19.830
because they have a lot, frankly,
they have a lot to handle.

00:43:19.830 --> 00:43:20.970
They have to handle the Reformation

00:43:20.970 --> 00:43:22.320
and the Counter-Reformation.

00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:24.867
They also have to handle after 1596,

00:43:24.867 --> 00:43:27.030
something called the Union of Brest,

00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:29.280
which is an attempt to bring the Catholic

00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:31.410
and the Orthodox churches together.

00:43:31.410 --> 00:43:32.430
They have a lot to talk about,

00:43:32.430 --> 00:43:34.362
and they learn how to do it, right?

00:43:34.362 --> 00:43:37.380
The Polish connection means the Baroque.

00:43:37.380 --> 00:43:39.783
It means fabulous architecture, right?

00:43:42.014 --> 00:43:44.250
The Saint Sophia, as
it stands today in Kyiv

00:43:44.250 --> 00:43:46.976
is not the same one, which was built sadly

00:43:46.976 --> 00:43:49.050
in the 11th century.

00:43:49.050 --> 00:43:50.940
It's a kind of Baroque reconstruction,

00:43:50.940 --> 00:43:52.650
and it's very beautiful.

00:43:52.650 --> 00:43:54.000
And there are lots of churches in Ukraine

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:55.980
that are very beautiful,
but they're in a kind

00:43:55.980 --> 00:43:59.430
of Orthodox Baroque style, right?

00:43:59.430 --> 00:44:01.410
So the, the Polish connection
is very interesting.

00:44:01.410 --> 00:44:02.340
It's very beautiful.

00:44:02.340 --> 00:44:06.960
It's also hugely polarizing
because it puts a small number

00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:10.320
of people with one
language and one religion,

00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:13.350
and who have property rights
against a much larger group

00:44:13.350 --> 00:44:16.350
of people who have none
of those three people,

00:44:16.350 --> 00:44:18.420
which leads us to the Cassocks.

00:44:18.420 --> 00:44:23.420
So, the Cassocks are free people

00:44:23.858 --> 00:44:26.940
who manage to escape this system.

00:44:26.940 --> 00:44:30.570
They escape the system in which either you

00:44:30.570 --> 00:44:32.640
are a noble or a serf, right?

00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:34.410
That's the Polish system.

00:44:34.410 --> 00:44:37.950
They escape that system by
going into the steppe, right,

00:44:37.950 --> 00:44:41.343
into the steppe into what's
now the southeast of Ukraine.

00:44:42.210 --> 00:44:45.030
They have their headquarters
and what they call the Sich

00:44:45.030 --> 00:44:48.150
in the middle of the
Dniepr River, they farm,

00:44:48.150 --> 00:44:51.156
they fish, and they raid.

00:44:51.156 --> 00:44:52.830
They raid the Crimean Khanate,

00:44:52.830 --> 00:44:54.000
which we're gonna talk about.

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:56.793
Sometimes they even try to raid Istanbul.

00:45:00.030 --> 00:45:02.643
And they survive by being out of reach.

00:45:03.540 --> 00:45:06.390
They are at the fringes
though of the Polish system,

00:45:06.390 --> 00:45:08.400
and they understand the Polish system,

00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:12.870
and many of them are educated
by some of them anyway,

00:45:12.870 --> 00:45:17.850
like Bohdan Khmelnytsky, they're
educated by Jesuits, right?

00:45:17.850 --> 00:45:19.590
They know the Polish system

00:45:19.590 --> 00:45:23.070
and they have the idea of
rights, very important idea.

00:45:23.070 --> 00:45:24.630
They have the idea of rights.

00:45:24.630 --> 00:45:28.120
They have the idea that if we were nobles,

00:45:28.120 --> 00:45:30.960
we would have rights, right?

00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:33.660
And the Cossacks wanna
be in the Polish system,

00:45:33.660 --> 00:45:35.280
but they're not allowed
into the Polish system

00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:36.840
because the existing Polish nobility

00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:38.580
won't let them into the Polish system.

00:45:38.580 --> 00:45:41.250
So there's a compromise, which is struck,

00:45:41.250 --> 00:45:44.580
which is called being
a registered Cossack.

00:45:44.580 --> 00:45:47.280
So, there was a list of
a few thousand Cossacks

00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:50.250
who had some kind of
status in the Polish state,

00:45:50.250 --> 00:45:53.070
and then the rest of them were
called unregistered Cossacks,

00:45:53.070 --> 00:45:55.920
and they had no kind of
status in the Polish state.

00:45:55.920 --> 00:45:58.200
Every time Poland wanted to fight a war,

00:45:58.200 --> 00:46:00.750
the Cossacks suddenly
became very important.

00:46:00.750 --> 00:46:02.520
And this, by the way, was the period

00:46:02.520 --> 00:46:05.880
when the Poles were
extraordinarily successful

00:46:05.880 --> 00:46:07.650
on the battlefield, late 16th century,

00:46:07.650 --> 00:46:11.370
early 17th century, when they
were defeating the Ottomans

00:46:11.370 --> 00:46:13.140
and they were defeating the Russians.

00:46:13.140 --> 00:46:15.480
In the early 17th century circa 1620,

00:46:15.480 --> 00:46:17.610
Poland is bigger than it ever will be,

00:46:17.610 --> 00:46:19.410
ever will be before or again.

00:46:19.410 --> 00:46:21.000
And that's when the Cossacks

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:23.992
are essentially serving as infantry.

00:46:23.992 --> 00:46:27.360
And the Polish nobility
is serving as cavalry.

00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:29.752
And they fight
extraordinarily well together.

00:46:29.752 --> 00:46:31.800
It's not a combination you would wish

00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:33.720
to face on the battlefield.

00:46:33.720 --> 00:46:37.620
But in 1648, this all breaks up.

00:46:37.620 --> 00:46:39.690
And you've heard some about this already.

00:46:39.690 --> 00:46:43.560
The underlying reasons
are what I talked about,

00:46:43.560 --> 00:46:48.560
the social, religious, and
linguistic differences.

00:46:48.990 --> 00:46:51.270
The precipitating reason has

00:46:51.270 --> 00:46:53.100
to do with the Cossacks themselves

00:46:53.100 --> 00:46:54.660
and whether or not Cossacks

00:46:54.660 --> 00:46:56.520
are part of the Polish state or not.

00:46:56.520 --> 00:46:59.640
In particular, this guy
whose name I probably forget

00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:02.457
to write down, write
down Khmelnytsky Bohdan.

00:47:12.510 --> 00:47:15.880
He has a claim which has to
do with his wife and property.

00:47:15.880 --> 00:47:19.740
And he's unable to get his
claim through the Polish courts.

00:47:19.740 --> 00:47:22.710
And at least, in legend,
the king laughs at him,

00:47:22.710 --> 00:47:26.002
you know, and he naturally
thinks, if I were a Polish noble,

00:47:26.002 --> 00:47:28.230
I would have access to the Polish courts.

00:47:28.230 --> 00:47:31.020
And he doesn't, and so he does what you do

00:47:31.020 --> 00:47:32.850
when you don't have access to the law,

00:47:32.850 --> 00:47:34.650
which is that he rebels.

00:47:34.650 --> 00:47:38.850
But he rebels at a
time, this is the 1640s,

00:47:38.850 --> 00:47:41.970
at a time when the Cossacks
were all gathered anyway

00:47:41.970 --> 00:47:43.830
on the field for what was going

00:47:43.830 --> 00:47:45.780
to be a war against the Ottoman Empire.

00:47:45.780 --> 00:47:48.180
And instead of fighting
against the Ottoman Empire,

00:47:48.180 --> 00:47:52.170
Khmelnytsky rouses them to
fight against the Poles.

00:47:52.170 --> 00:47:56.730
This happens at a time
when the Polish king dies,

00:47:56.730 --> 00:47:59.820
which means that there's
a while when the Cossacks

00:47:59.820 --> 00:48:01.789
have a great deal of
success on the battlefield

00:48:01.789 --> 00:48:03.630
fighting whom?

00:48:03.630 --> 00:48:04.890
This is important.

00:48:04.890 --> 00:48:09.510
Fighting generally the Polish
speaking Roman Catholic,

00:48:09.510 --> 00:48:11.340
Ukrainian nobility, right?

00:48:11.340 --> 00:48:12.960
This is largely a, this is not how it

00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:14.280
is in the Ukrainian textbooks,

00:48:14.280 --> 00:48:17.220
but this is largely a
Ukrainian-Ukrainian Civil War.

00:48:17.220 --> 00:48:18.180
At least at the beginning.

00:48:18.180 --> 00:48:20.724
It's the Cossacks against the Ukrainized,

00:48:20.724 --> 00:48:23.250
the Polandized Roman Catholic

00:48:23.250 --> 00:48:25.860
Polish-speaking local Ukrainian nobility,

00:48:25.860 --> 00:48:27.900
until the Polish army eventually shows up

00:48:27.900 --> 00:48:29.584
and turns the tide.

00:48:29.584 --> 00:48:32.280
When the Polish army shows
up and turns the tide,

00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:33.900
we have a very fateful moment.

00:48:33.900 --> 00:48:36.450
And the very fateful
moment is that the Cossacks

00:48:36.450 --> 00:48:38.430
have to seek an ally.

00:48:38.430 --> 00:48:40.950
Up until about that time, their ally had

00:48:40.950 --> 00:48:44.313
been the Crimean Tatars,
the Crimean Khanate.

00:48:45.153 --> 00:48:50.153
As of 1654, the Crimean
Khanate has withdrawn,

00:48:50.561 --> 00:48:53.640
the Cossacks are losing
to the Polish state.

00:48:53.640 --> 00:48:55.290
And so they need an ally.

00:48:55.290 --> 00:48:59.280
And for an ally, they
find this fairly exotic

00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:00.990
and unknown to them state,

00:49:00.990 --> 00:49:02.220
which we've talked about a little bit.

00:49:02.220 --> 00:49:03.053
And we'll talk about more

00:49:03.053 --> 00:49:05.370
in the next lecture, which is Muscovy.

00:49:05.370 --> 00:49:07.520
And after that, everything
changes, thanks.

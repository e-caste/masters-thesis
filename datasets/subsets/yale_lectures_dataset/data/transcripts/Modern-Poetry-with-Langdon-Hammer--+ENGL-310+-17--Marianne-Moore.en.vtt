00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:04.748
Professor Langdon
Hammer: I was wanting to

00:00:04.748 --> 00:00:07.270
carry over more Williams today.
 

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:09.856
Poor Williams,
he only got a day,

00:00:09.856 --> 00:00:14.058
like Langston Hughes,
but it's hard to give everybody

00:00:14.058 --> 00:00:17.807
their day.
And I think on reflection I'd

00:00:17.807 --> 00:00:23.492
rather give two full lectures to
Marianne Moore because first of

00:00:23.492 --> 00:00:26.290
all, she's a difficult poet.
 

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:32.026
"Oh good," you're saying,
"as opposed to all these other

00:00:32.026 --> 00:00:35.680
people."
She's difficult in a different

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.030
way, and in some ways she
doesn't seem difficult,

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:46.655
as you get started,
but she's idiosyncratic and I'd

00:00:46.655 --> 00:00:54.739
like to give her a chance to get
your attention and give you a

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:59.510
chance to learn how to read her.
 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.211
It also strikes me that we
haven't read a lot of women

00:01:04.211 --> 00:01:07.049
poets in this course,
have we?

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:12.397
We've read H.D.,
but that's really about it so

00:01:12.397 --> 00:01:18.417
far.
The giants of modern poetry,

00:01:18.417 --> 00:01:25.810
they're men:
Yeats, Eliot and company.

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:31.459
Moore has a claim to stature
like theirs.

00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:37.656
I think she is a remarkable
poet, and one who interestingly,

00:01:37.656 --> 00:01:43.328
I think, has had as much or
perhaps even more practical

00:01:43.328 --> 00:01:49.209
influence and effect over the
development of poetry since

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:53.484
modernism,
as much or more than any of the

00:01:53.484 --> 00:01:55.660
poets we've been reading.
 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:01.067
The general question of the
position of women and of women

00:02:01.067 --> 00:02:06.189
poets in modern poetry is
interesting and important,

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:10.360
and an important context for
thinking about Moore.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:18.647
Women in the modernist literary
culture that we've been studying

00:02:18.647 --> 00:02:26.541
are identified very frequently
with popular and gentile forms

00:02:26.541 --> 00:02:31.413
of writing and taste;
think about Hart Crane

00:02:31.413 --> 00:02:35.518
complaining to Harriet Monroe,
the editor of Poetry

00:02:35.518 --> 00:02:39.190
magazine, as if she's just too
square to get it.

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.479
This is not an unusual attitude.
 

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:47.428
Women are associated to a
degree with political writing of

00:02:47.428 --> 00:02:51.030
the period, certain kinds of
experimental writing,

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:57.554
and also above all with the
legacy of the nineteenth-century

00:02:57.554 --> 00:03:02.177
poetess.
James Joyce said The Waste

00:03:02.177 --> 00:03:08.000
Land "ended the idea of
poetry for ladies";

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.290
this is its achievement.
 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:16.952
Poor ladies!
Well, you maybe get the idea in

00:03:16.952 --> 00:03:23.419
Joyce's comment that here was a
poem that broke with a

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:30.739
nineteenth-century culture of
poetry that was in certain ways

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:35.413
feminized,
at least as imagined here by

00:03:35.413 --> 00:03:39.780
Joyce and certainly by other
modern poets.

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:45.150
At the same time you can think
about the very rich and

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:51.026
complicated role of women in
The Waste Land in order

00:03:51.026 --> 00:03:56.397
to get some sense of the
complexity of the position of

00:03:56.397 --> 00:04:00.449
women in modern poetry in
general.

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:05.345
Think of the ways in which
Eliot as a poet draws on female

00:04:05.345 --> 00:04:09.768
speakers and female voices and,
you might say,

00:04:09.768 --> 00:04:15.215
even aspires to sound like
Isolde or Philomel or,

00:04:15.215 --> 00:04:21.569
well, one of his own inventions
in "The Fire Sermon."

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:26.757
In general, you could say that
the modern poets we've been

00:04:26.757 --> 00:04:31.488
reading aggressively and
self-consciously masculinize

00:04:31.488 --> 00:04:35.876
poetry,
in particular by trying to

00:04:35.876 --> 00:04:42.779
disassociate poetry from what is
commercial, polite,

00:04:42.779 --> 00:04:47.172
soft, dreamy,
ideal, leisured – all

00:04:47.172 --> 00:04:54.492
qualities and attitudes gendered
in their imagination – and

00:04:54.492 --> 00:05:01.689
instead connect poetry to what
is technically rigorous,

00:05:01.689 --> 00:05:05.689
advanced, learned,
unsentimental,

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:11.190
hard, and often hard work:
terms that are,

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:14.149
again, clearly gendered.
 

00:05:14.149 --> 00:05:17.142
H.D.
in her own distinctive way is

00:05:17.142 --> 00:05:20.680
also doing this,
taking part in this.

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:26.286
Modern poetry wanted to make
poetry culturally central and

00:05:26.286 --> 00:05:31.892
powerful, to reposition it,
to achieve for it the power to

00:05:31.892 --> 00:05:35.040
define and describe culture.
 

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:38.674
And this was very often,
as I'm suggesting,

00:05:38.674 --> 00:05:41.790
played out in very gendered
terms,

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:49.505
trying to claim for poetry a
set of capacities that were

00:05:49.505 --> 00:05:56.379
strongly gendered in these
poets' imaginations.

00:05:56.379 --> 00:05:58.952
At the same time this desire,
as I'm saying,

00:05:58.952 --> 00:06:02.242
is conflicted and complicated,
and we need only think of

00:06:02.242 --> 00:06:05.965
Eliot's case,
but you could look back to

00:06:05.965 --> 00:06:11.999
Yeats's relationship to women
speakers, his own complicated

00:06:11.999 --> 00:06:16.889
set of identifications with
them, and so on.

00:06:16.889 --> 00:06:20.269
How does Marianne Moore fit in
this?

00:06:20.269 --> 00:06:25.329
What did it mean for her to be
a modern poet and a woman?

00:06:25.329 --> 00:06:30.081
These are questions that I'll
take up today,

00:06:30.081 --> 00:06:36.269
first of all addressing this
question specifically of,

00:06:36.269 --> 00:06:40.319
well, what did it mean to write
from the position of a woman,

00:06:40.319 --> 00:06:43.867
for Moore?
And then I want to go on and

00:06:43.867 --> 00:06:48.754
talk about Moore as an American
poet, which she was

00:06:48.754 --> 00:06:54.396
self-consciously,
and then to begin to talk about

00:06:54.396 --> 00:06:59.629
Moore as a nature poet,
which she also was.

00:06:59.629 --> 00:07:04.875
Let's get started by looking at
one of her earliest

00:07:04.875 --> 00:07:09.177
publications,
a poem that like many of the

00:07:09.177 --> 00:07:14.737
other important early poems by
these poets appeared in

00:07:14.737 --> 00:07:21.439
Poetry magazine,
this time I think in 1919;

00:07:21.439 --> 00:07:23.800
I'm not sure,
I'll check the date.

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:29.879
I'm talking about the poem
called "A Grave" on page 440.

00:07:29.879 --> 00:07:36.142
It's a great poem and it's a
poem that announces a speaker

00:07:36.142 --> 00:07:42.404
that sounds like no one else,
and sounds like certainly no

00:07:42.404 --> 00:07:45.589
one we have been reading.
 

00:07:45.589 --> 00:07:51.320
Think about "The Seafarer,"
another poem about the sea.

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:52.589
How did that sound?
 

00:07:52.589 --> 00:07:56.390
"Bitter breast-cares have I
abided, nigh on the

00:07:56.390 --> 00:08:00.895
night-watch."
You remember Pound's sonorous

00:08:00.895 --> 00:08:07.426
and even perhaps ponderous,
heroic Anglo-Saxon alliterative

00:08:07.426 --> 00:08:10.574
meter,
which I talked about as,

00:08:10.574 --> 00:08:14.487
in Pound's case,
a deliberate and interesting

00:08:14.487 --> 00:08:19.734
evasion of iambic pentameter
norms – blank verse as a kind

00:08:19.734 --> 00:08:22.579
of model for heroic speech.
 

00:08:22.579 --> 00:08:24.953
Well, so is this,
but it sounds nothing like

00:08:24.953 --> 00:08:26.876
that.
It's on the other end of the

00:08:26.876 --> 00:08:29.030
spectrum, right?
It sounds like what?

00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:33.957
Prose, in certain ways;
a remarkable,

00:08:33.957 --> 00:08:39.532
elevated prose,
but prose, prose that uses

00:08:39.532 --> 00:08:47.009
words like "consciousness" or
"volition," "however."

00:08:47.009 --> 00:08:51.179
When was the last time you saw
a poem that said "however"?

00:08:51.179 --> 00:08:55.895
It really announces a speaker
who is using a kind of

00:08:55.895 --> 00:08:57.930
expository language.
 

00:08:57.930 --> 00:09:02.389
There are Latinate words.
 

00:09:02.389 --> 00:09:08.889
There's obviously no meter and
rhyme.

00:09:08.889 --> 00:09:14.804
At the same time there is a
developed and,

00:09:14.804 --> 00:09:22.450
as almost always in Moore,
intricate formal design,

00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:27.798
an idiosyncratic formal design
that is operating in the poem,

00:09:27.798 --> 00:09:29.760
but almost secretly.
 

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:32.370
What's it look like on the page?
 

00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:34.750
A lot of long lines, right?
 

00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:38.090
A lot of long lines,
some of which run over.

00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:44.431
Well, this, like other Moore
poems, is a poem structured

00:09:44.431 --> 00:09:49.850
around counting syllables per
line and counting,

00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:53.309
in fact, numbers of lines.
 

00:09:53.309 --> 00:09:58.272
This is not a kind of formal
organization that you hear,

00:09:58.272 --> 00:10:03.320
and it's even difficult to see,
but it's an operative one for

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:07.820
her and it's one of the ways in
which she organizes her verse.

00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:12.178
It's as if Moore has in some
sense set up her own rules,

00:10:12.178 --> 00:10:15.190
clung to them,
and kept them secret.

00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:16.649
She doesn't always keep them
secret;

00:10:16.649 --> 00:10:21.758
sometimes they're quite
conspicuous and even flashy in

00:10:21.758 --> 00:10:24.940
certain poems in their designs.
 

00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:27.559
But here it's quite
inconspicuous.

00:10:27.559 --> 00:10:32.662
What you have is a poem that is
made up of two eleven-line

00:10:32.662 --> 00:10:36.960
groups, two eleven-line stanzas
or paragraphs,

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:40.225
each beginning with a short
seven-syllable line:

00:10:40.225 --> 00:10:45.026
"Man looking into the sea,"
"for their bones have not

00:10:45.026 --> 00:10:48.392
lasted."
This is the pattern that

00:10:48.392 --> 00:10:50.460
structures the poem.
 

00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:54.887
In all these ways that I'm
describing – the syllable

00:10:54.887 --> 00:11:00.483
count, the expository writing,
the Latinate diction,

00:11:00.483 --> 00:11:06.469
the self-conscious,
prose-like nature of the

00:11:06.469 --> 00:11:11.153
language,
all those semi-colons – this

00:11:11.153 --> 00:11:17.279
is poetry that has distanced
itself from traditions of song,

00:11:17.279 --> 00:11:22.166
and certainly from
nineteenth-century traditions of

00:11:22.166 --> 00:11:25.710
versification.
The form of the poem is,

00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:30.250
again, not something you see or
even hear necessarily.

00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:33.769
It's there almost as a kind of
absence.

00:11:33.769 --> 00:11:37.595
Now, there's also,
wonderfully,

00:11:37.595 --> 00:11:40.909
a certain combativeness.
 

00:11:40.909 --> 00:11:46.070
Moore is a combative and
pugnacious poet.

00:11:46.070 --> 00:11:52.122
You, again, may not see this
immediately because of the

00:11:52.122 --> 00:11:58.541
poem's impersonality,
the way in which it seems to

00:11:58.541 --> 00:12:06.225
present itself and the often
intricate forms of syntax or

00:12:06.225 --> 00:12:08.970
oblique approach.
 

00:12:08.970 --> 00:12:15.022
But she is a fighter,
and this poem is really a kind

00:12:15.022 --> 00:12:18.820
of fighting that we're seeing.
 

00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:22.669
The poem begins in irritation.
 

00:12:22.669 --> 00:12:27.407
It begins as a complaint – a
complaint that's addressed to

00:12:27.407 --> 00:12:29.810
whom?
To man;

00:12:29.810 --> 00:12:32.720
"Man looking into the sea."
 

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:38.190
"Man" suggests,
well, maybe humankind.

00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:41.878
You think about the people on
the shore in Frost's poem,

00:12:41.878 --> 00:12:45.901
"Neither Out Far Nor In Deep,"
who are standing there looking

00:12:45.901 --> 00:12:47.309
out at the water.
 

00:12:47.309 --> 00:12:51.799
Well, Moore might be addressing
them.

00:12:51.799 --> 00:12:59.559
But I think there's a more
specific and particular "man"

00:12:59.559 --> 00:13:05.909
that is the irritant that sets
the poem going:

00:13:05.909 --> 00:13:08.979
a man,
the figure of a man who,

00:13:08.979 --> 00:13:12.367
like a romantic poet,
has arrogated to himself the

00:13:12.367 --> 00:13:17.163
position to take in the view,
to stand like the figure in a

00:13:17.163 --> 00:13:22.419
Caspar David Friedrich painting
and gaze into the sublime.

00:13:22.419 --> 00:13:28.310
Meanwhile, Moore is somewhere
else.

00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:32.991
Where is she?
She's somewhere behind him,

00:13:32.991 --> 00:13:38.559
because he's blocked her view:
"Man looking into the sea,

00:13:38.559 --> 00:13:41.588
/ taking the view from those
who have as much right to it as

00:13:41.588 --> 00:13:42.820
you have to yourself."
 

00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:47.816
Well, "it is human nature to
stand in the middle of a thing,"

00:13:47.816 --> 00:13:51.230
she says, trying to make sense
of this.

00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:57.918
Moore has a couple of comments
here that describe the origins

00:13:57.918 --> 00:14:01.223
of this poem.
It's the first quotation on

00:14:01.223 --> 00:14:03.059
your handout.
She says:

00:14:03.059 --> 00:14:07.417
As for "A Grave," it has
a significance apart from the

00:14:07.417 --> 00:14:11.110
literal origin [but here is the
literal origin],

00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:15.338
which was a man who placed
himself between my mother and

00:14:15.338 --> 00:14:19.489
me, and the surf we were
watching from the middle ledge

00:14:19.489 --> 00:14:23.179
of rocks on Monhegan Island
after the storm.

00:14:23.179 --> 00:14:25.669
("Don't be annoyed," my mother
said.

00:14:25.669 --> 00:14:29.019
"It is human nature to stand in
the middle of a thing.")

00:14:29.019 --> 00:14:33.549
It is important that,
however, Moore was annoyed.

00:14:33.549 --> 00:14:36.555
She was annoyed into poetry,
you could say,

00:14:36.555 --> 00:14:39.059
and she took her mother with
her.

00:14:39.059 --> 00:14:44.766
The poem is really written from
the perspective of a daughter

00:14:44.766 --> 00:14:50.662
and mother, and a daughter with
an intimate relationship to her

00:14:50.662 --> 00:14:55.486
mother who absorbs,
here and very often elsewhere

00:14:55.486 --> 00:14:59.578
in her poetry,
actual quotations from but even

00:14:59.578 --> 00:15:04.760
more importantly a style of
speech and attitude associated

00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:09.207
with her mother,
who talks a lot like Dr.

00:15:09.207 --> 00:15:15.233
Samuel Johnson or some other
eighteenth-century figure and

00:15:15.233 --> 00:15:17.559
moralist like that.
 

00:15:17.559 --> 00:15:22.314
Mrs.
Moore is someone whom Marianne

00:15:22.314 --> 00:15:26.929
always identified with herself.
 

00:15:26.929 --> 00:15:31.865
It's significant here that
Moore is using a quotation from

00:15:31.865 --> 00:15:37.059
her mother and not acknowledging
it in any particular way,

00:15:37.059 --> 00:15:42.769
as if the two women had one
voice and one perspective.

00:15:42.769 --> 00:15:47.373
The man who blocks their point
of view, and blocks their point

00:15:47.373 --> 00:15:51.459
of view, you could say,
in many senses – their

00:15:51.459 --> 00:15:56.866
literal point of view of the
water – but also the point of

00:15:56.866 --> 00:16:02.090
view he takes in effect ignores
and suppresses theirs.

00:16:02.090 --> 00:16:05.308
He is standing in the posture,
as I suggest,

00:16:05.308 --> 00:16:09.574
of a kind of conventional,
romantic visionary staring into

00:16:09.574 --> 00:16:11.970
the sea, emblem of infinity.
 

00:16:11.970 --> 00:16:16.567
Well, it might be Hart Crane
writing "At Melville's Tomb,"

00:16:16.567 --> 00:16:21.649
although Crane wouldn't write
that poem for a few more years;

00:16:21.649 --> 00:16:23.518
and when he did,
incidentally,

00:16:23.518 --> 00:16:27.061
he sent it to Marianne Moore,
who was then the editor of

00:16:27.061 --> 00:16:29.960
The Dial,
who sent it back and rejected

00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:32.040
it.
Moore's poem is,

00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:36.916
in fact, as I suggested,
an early poem of hers and an

00:16:36.916 --> 00:16:42.355
early act of self-definition
that's quite important in both

00:16:42.355 --> 00:16:47.887
the impersonality of the point
of view and yet the insistent

00:16:47.887 --> 00:16:51.920
individuality of that point of
view.

00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:54.059
Moore's poems are like this.
 

00:16:54.059 --> 00:16:59.427
They seem impersonal and yet
they're at the same time deeply

00:16:59.427 --> 00:17:02.429
personal and deeply individual.
 

00:17:02.429 --> 00:17:09.017
Here she celebrates the power
of the sea to resist the

00:17:09.017 --> 00:17:16.351
imposition of the observer's
will, or the will of the sailor

00:17:16.351 --> 00:17:21.145
or seafarer;
you can even think of Odysseus

00:17:21.145 --> 00:17:23.109
or Pound's seafarer.
 

00:17:23.109 --> 00:17:28.406
The sea is "a collector,
quick to return a rapacious

00:17:28.406 --> 00:17:32.665
look": i.e.
if you want to take possession

00:17:32.665 --> 00:17:37.962
of the sea in some way,
well, don't think you can do

00:17:37.962 --> 00:17:44.297
that because this is a grander
force than you and it will take

00:17:44.297 --> 00:17:51.544
you up and drown you,
which is what the poem goes on

00:17:51.544 --> 00:17:56.117
to describe.
The sea has here the force that

00:17:56.117 --> 00:18:00.974
it does in other great poems by
Moore like "The Fish" or

00:18:00.974 --> 00:18:03.270
"Sojourn in the Whale."
 

00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:06.650
It seems to stand for death.
 

00:18:06.650 --> 00:18:12.819
It is a grave;
it is a grave in which you

00:18:12.819 --> 00:18:16.648
could say a certain idea of
romantic and,

00:18:16.648 --> 00:18:21.817
I think, specifically male
subjectivity is overcome and

00:18:21.817 --> 00:18:24.690
buried, shown its limits.
 

00:18:24.690 --> 00:18:31.397
In this poem the human,
imagined finally as something

00:18:31.397 --> 00:18:36.299
that twists and turns in the
depths,

00:18:36.299 --> 00:18:42.812
is converted by natural forces
into a part of the natural world

00:18:42.812 --> 00:18:49.010
that it sought through the man's
perspective to dominate.

00:18:49.010 --> 00:18:53.710
Moore sent this poem to Pound.
 

00:18:53.710 --> 00:18:56.210
These poets are always sending
their poems to Pound.

00:18:56.210 --> 00:19:01.471
He responded with admiration in
that second quotation there,

00:19:01.471 --> 00:19:03.789
and he says:
"Thank God,

00:19:03.789 --> 00:19:09.198
I think you can be trusted not
to pour out a flood (in the

00:19:09.198 --> 00:19:12.519
manner of dear Amy and
Masters),"

00:19:12.519 --> 00:19:18.815
who though not a woman was a
sentimental regionalist and not

00:19:18.815 --> 00:19:21.910
an international modernist.
 

00:19:21.910 --> 00:19:26.690
Pound is approving of Moore
here.

00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:33.839
He approves that she does not
gush, she does not emote.

00:19:33.839 --> 00:19:36.180
She has not written a
sentimental poem.

00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:40.000
In fact, in certain ways she's
written an anti-sentimental

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.402
poem.
I think it's important that

00:19:43.402 --> 00:19:49.809
Moore's rhetorical choices have
prevented her from doing so,

00:19:49.809 --> 00:19:56.759
that the poem has the kind of
formal self-discipline it does.

00:19:56.759 --> 00:20:03.230
Again, these are aspects of
restraint in the poetry.

00:20:03.230 --> 00:20:08.299
Moore is dry in all respects.
 

00:20:08.299 --> 00:20:13.311
At the same time,
these are modernist values,

00:20:13.311 --> 00:20:18.550
values that Pound would
describe in his Imagist

00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:21.740
manifesto and elsewhere.
 

00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:27.002
At the same time,
Moore gets her dryness not by

00:20:27.002 --> 00:20:33.295
disavowing femininity or
suppressing it or attacking it,

00:20:33.295 --> 00:20:37.299
as one of her peers might have.
 

00:20:37.299 --> 00:20:40.726
She does it,
rather, specifically in this

00:20:40.726 --> 00:20:43.039
act of challenging "man."
 

00:20:43.039 --> 00:20:52.635
Let me look with you at the
letter that Moore wrote to Pound

00:20:52.635 --> 00:21:03.369
in response that acts as a kind
of, now, letter of introduction.

00:21:03.369 --> 00:21:08.121
And it has a lot of interesting
things in it and it's probably a

00:21:08.121 --> 00:21:11.590
good introduction to who she is
for us, too.

00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:16.691
She says:
I was born in 1887 and

00:21:16.691 --> 00:21:20.993
brought up in the home of my
grandfather, a clergyman of the

00:21:20.993 --> 00:21:22.670
Presbyterian church.
 

00:21:22.670 --> 00:21:27.178
[She comes from a Christian and
God-fearing home.]

00:21:27.178 --> 00:21:31.779
I am Irish by descent [and
that's where some of the

00:21:31.779 --> 00:21:36.190
combativeness comes from],
possibly Scotch also,

00:21:36.190 --> 00:21:39.804
but purely Celtic,
was graduated from Bryn Mawr

00:21:39.804 --> 00:21:44.518
[where she knew and befriended
H.D.]… and taught shorthand,

00:21:44.518 --> 00:21:48.665
typewriting….
[She's worked for a living.]

00:21:48.665 --> 00:21:51.975
In 1916 my mother [Mary Warner
Moore]

00:21:51.975 --> 00:21:57.309
and I left home in Carlisle to
be with… [her brother,

00:21:57.309 --> 00:21:59.458
a]
Chaplain of the battleship

00:21:59.458 --> 00:22:03.773
Rhode Island….
[There's a lot of Christianity

00:22:03.773 --> 00:22:07.077
in the family.
She says that she's living with

00:22:07.077 --> 00:22:10.219
her mother in New York,
and indeed she would spend the

00:22:10.219 --> 00:22:13.480
rest of her life living with her
mother in New York,

00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:17.900
in Greenwich Village and in
Brooklyn in a small apartment.]

00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:23.017
[C]ontrary to your impression,
I am altogether blond and have

00:22:23.017 --> 00:22:26.625
red hair.
[Pound had asked whether she

00:22:26.625 --> 00:22:30.795
was Ethiopian,
after he read the poem "Black

00:22:30.795 --> 00:22:36.807
Earth": read "Black Earth" and
decide whether Marianne Moore is

00:22:36.807 --> 00:22:40.519
an Ethiopian.]
[This is important.

00:22:40.519 --> 00:22:43.183
She says]
…Any verse that I have

00:22:43.183 --> 00:22:48.349
written, has been an arrangement
of stanzas, each stanza being an

00:22:48.349 --> 00:22:51.740
exact duplicate of every other
stanza.

00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:55.185
[This is not always true but
she claims it is.]

00:22:55.185 --> 00:22:59.529
I have occasionally been at
pains to make an arrangement of

00:22:59.529 --> 00:23:03.049
lines and rhymes that I like
repeat itself,

00:23:03.049 --> 00:23:06.531
but the form of the original
stanza of anything I have

00:23:06.531 --> 00:23:09.289
written has been a matter of
expediency,

00:23:09.289 --> 00:23:14.079
hit upon as being approximately
suitable to the subject matter.

00:23:14.079 --> 00:23:17.096
The resemblance of my progress
to your beginnings is an

00:23:17.096 --> 00:23:18.269
accident….

00:23:18.269 --> 00:23:22.195
"I wasn't influenced by you,
Pound, when I started writing

00:23:22.195 --> 00:23:25.983
syllabic verse" because Pound
had experimented with this

00:23:25.983 --> 00:23:29.004
himself.
There're a couple of ideas here

00:23:29.004 --> 00:23:30.420
that are important.
 

00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:33.737
First of all,
that Moore identifies,

00:23:33.737 --> 00:23:38.665
as it were, two moments of
creativity involved in the

00:23:38.665 --> 00:23:40.940
making of her poems.
 

00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:47.107
One is a moment of spontaneity
and expediency in which lines,

00:23:47.107 --> 00:23:51.630
almost like some kind of
channeled speech,

00:23:51.630 --> 00:23:56.989
arrive in a certain form,
and then she makes that form in

00:23:56.989 --> 00:24:01.869
its contingency and
accidentalness repeat itself.

00:24:01.869 --> 00:24:10.877
She goes on and what came by
chance she repeats through will,

00:24:10.877 --> 00:24:14.029
through discipline.
 

00:24:14.029 --> 00:24:22.467
This is significant and it's
related to, well,

00:24:22.467 --> 00:24:32.029
her originality of form,
which is something that,

00:24:32.029 --> 00:24:36.684
as it were, comes to her
naturally and that she builds on

00:24:36.684 --> 00:24:40.507
self-consciously and through a
kind of rigorous

00:24:40.507 --> 00:24:43.413
self-discipline.
She says then,

00:24:43.413 --> 00:24:45.099
"I do not appear."
 

00:24:45.099 --> 00:24:48.890
She meant, "I don't appear in
literary periodicals;

00:24:48.890 --> 00:24:51.329
you can't find my poems
anywhere."

00:24:51.329 --> 00:24:56.354
But the sentence itself is
wonderfully suggestive and

00:24:56.354 --> 00:24:59.059
simple, "I do not appear."
 

00:24:59.059 --> 00:25:03.174
And in fact,
Moore does not appear very much

00:25:03.174 --> 00:25:06.794
in her poems.
She is interestingly

00:25:06.794 --> 00:25:11.491
backgrounded or even invisible
in her poems,

00:25:11.491 --> 00:25:15.860
in the ways that she is in "A
Grave."

00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:19.268
And then she says:
I grow less and less

00:25:19.268 --> 00:25:23.303
desirous of being published,
produce less and have a strong

00:25:23.303 --> 00:25:27.059
feeling for letting alone what
little I do produce.

00:25:27.059 --> 00:25:31.566
[And then she continues]
…To capitalize the first word

00:25:31.566 --> 00:25:35.254
of every line is rather slavish
[as they do in

00:25:35.254 --> 00:25:39.678
nineteenth-century poetry]
and I have substituted small

00:25:39.678 --> 00:25:44.185
letters for capitals in the
enclosed versions of the two

00:25:44.185 --> 00:25:46.480
poems that you have.
 

00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:51.571
[This is another sort of
distinctive, formal choice Moore

00:25:51.571 --> 00:25:56.936
makes, not to capitalize her
first lines--something Williams

00:25:56.936 --> 00:26:00.730
does, too.]
…In "A Graveyard," [she goes

00:26:00.730 --> 00:26:05.429
on, now talking about the poem
"A Grave" (a grave is better

00:26:05.429 --> 00:26:08.426
than a graveyard,
don't you think?)]

00:26:08.426 --> 00:26:11.562
[the change]
that I have made is to end of

00:26:11.562 --> 00:26:14.162
the line [the very end of the
poem]

00:26:14.162 --> 00:26:17.910
as you suggest and for the sake
of symmetry,

00:26:17.910 --> 00:26:22.450
have altered the arrangement of
lines in the preceding stanzas.

00:26:22.450 --> 00:26:27.144
I realize that by writing
consciousness and volition [this

00:26:27.144 --> 00:26:32.251
is the order of the words that
Pound had proposed at the end of

00:26:32.251 --> 00:26:35.463
that poem]
emphasis is obtained which is

00:26:35.463 --> 00:26:40.569
sacrificed by retaining the
order which I have [that is,

00:26:40.569 --> 00:26:43.032
Moore's order,
"volition" and then

00:26:43.032 --> 00:26:46.389
"consciousness"],
and I am willing to make the

00:26:46.389 --> 00:26:49.283
change,
though I prefer the original

00:26:49.283 --> 00:26:51.949
order [which,
in fact, ultimately she

00:26:51.949 --> 00:26:55.523
kept].
Let's look at the end of the

00:26:55.523 --> 00:27:03.319
poem again.
I'll read from line 20:

00:27:03.319 --> 00:27:06.705
Pound said, "Well,
that ending just doesn't quite

00:27:06.705 --> 00:27:08.579
do it.
Why don't you switch

00:27:08.579 --> 00:27:10.740
'consciousness' and 'volition'?"
 

00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:12.690
With what implication?
 

00:27:12.690 --> 00:27:19.155
That somehow "volition" is more
important than "consciousness,"

00:27:19.155 --> 00:27:25.411
that it's the last thing to go
and the most dramatic thing to

00:27:25.411 --> 00:27:27.534
lose.
Moore, however,

00:27:27.534 --> 00:27:30.220
insists: no,
that's not the case;

00:27:30.220 --> 00:27:32.069
it's the other way around.
 

00:27:32.069 --> 00:27:35.039
"Consciousness" is more
important than "volition."

00:27:35.039 --> 00:27:37.800
In fact, that's really what
this whole poem is about,

00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:41.818
you could say.
Pound wanted the emphasis,

00:27:41.818 --> 00:27:47.423
to take Moore's word,
that comes with stressing

00:27:47.423 --> 00:27:51.809
"volition" as most important
and,

00:27:51.809 --> 00:27:55.359
in fact, volition is nothing
but a kind of expression of

00:27:55.359 --> 00:27:57.196
emphasis.
She says no,

00:27:57.196 --> 00:28:01.889
"consciousness" is more
important, and as she does,

00:28:01.889 --> 00:28:03.859
she emphasizes it.
 

00:28:03.859 --> 00:28:09.904
She introduces another kind of
emphasis, one associated not

00:28:09.904 --> 00:28:16.054
specifically with volition so
much as the drama and power of

00:28:16.054 --> 00:28:23.220
consciousness,
which she insists on here.

00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:30.584
Although Moore's poem could be,
in fact, read as a kind of

00:28:30.584 --> 00:28:38.077
rebuke in advance to Hart Crane
and his poem "At Melville's

00:28:38.077 --> 00:28:40.541
Tomb,"
Moore, in fact,

00:28:40.541 --> 00:28:43.819
got to know and like Crane in
the twenties,

00:28:43.819 --> 00:28:48.347
sometimes acting as his editor
when he sent poems to The

00:28:48.347 --> 00:28:50.690
Dial for publication.
 

00:28:50.690 --> 00:28:53.310
She turned back "At Melville's
Tomb."

00:28:53.310 --> 00:28:55.210
She accepted other poems.
 

00:28:55.210 --> 00:28:59.683
One poem she accepted,
"The Wine Menagerie," was a

00:28:59.683 --> 00:29:01.509
poem in quatrains.
 

00:29:01.509 --> 00:29:05.585
She accepted it and then
converted the poem into free

00:29:05.585 --> 00:29:08.720
verse and reduced it by half its
size.

00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:13.625
Crane accepted it,
accepted this publication along

00:29:13.625 --> 00:29:17.230
with ten dollars,
which he needed.

00:29:17.230 --> 00:29:22.658
But both Crane and Moore,
like Williams,

00:29:22.658 --> 00:29:28.087
were, I think,
self-consciously American

00:29:28.087 --> 00:29:31.622
poets,
and their American-ness is

00:29:31.622 --> 00:29:36.319
important to how they define
themselves as modern poets.

00:29:36.319 --> 00:29:42.151
And there is really in all of
them a certain kind of

00:29:42.151 --> 00:29:49.356
combative, cultural nationalism,
which has aesthetic and ethical

00:29:49.356 --> 00:29:52.760
implications.
As an example,

00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:58.500
let's turn a page back and look
at the poem "England."

00:29:58.500 --> 00:30:06.819
Okay, the poem begins here as a
series of national caricatures

00:30:06.819 --> 00:30:14.730
and then eventually it will move
from these caricatures,

00:30:14.730 --> 00:30:19.813
which suggest ways of life and
also aesthetic dispositions,

00:30:19.813 --> 00:30:24.019
ways of doing and thinking
about art, I think;

00:30:24.019 --> 00:30:28.293
she'll move from that to talk
about America,

00:30:28.293 --> 00:30:30.579
and what is American.
 

00:30:30.579 --> 00:30:33.855
And this is,
you could say,

00:30:33.855 --> 00:30:36.880
her real subject here.
 

00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:42.000
And then she will go on and
describe America.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:46.815
She will go on and contrast
everything that she has just

00:30:46.815 --> 00:30:51.630
caricatured in a polite but
essentially negative way,

00:30:51.630 --> 00:30:56.485
in each of those cases,
with the American,

00:30:56.485 --> 00:31:03.710
and specifically with American
speech and American English.

00:31:03.710 --> 00:31:06.414
In other words,
just because Americans who say

00:31:06.414 --> 00:31:09.659
"psalm" or "calm" sound like
that instead of "psalm" or

00:31:09.659 --> 00:31:11.862
"calm,"
that doesn't mean they're

00:31:11.862 --> 00:31:14.269
stupid or that the rest of
America is.

00:31:14.269 --> 00:31:17.303
In other words,
if you don't think you can get

00:31:17.303 --> 00:31:20.000
poetry in America,
you haven't looked.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:21.869
It's a wonderful poem.
 

00:31:21.869 --> 00:31:27.657
It's a defense of America and
American creativity,

00:31:27.657 --> 00:31:30.019
American language.
 

00:31:30.019 --> 00:31:34.940
It is an attack on Eurocentric,
cultural snobs.

00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:40.115
At the same time,
Moore is not only or merely

00:31:40.115 --> 00:31:45.289
adding America as one among
other nations.

00:31:45.289 --> 00:31:51.437
Rather, America is the locality
where this principle of hers is

00:31:51.437 --> 00:31:56.890
honored, a place that
incorporates many other places,

00:31:56.890 --> 00:32:01.768
many other cultures,
many other ways of feeling and

00:32:01.768 --> 00:32:04.109
thinking and speaking.
 

00:32:04.109 --> 00:32:07.748
This principle,
the idea that inspiration has

00:32:07.748 --> 00:32:10.890
never been confined to one
locality,

00:32:10.890 --> 00:32:14.586
to one place,
affirms a kind of art that is

00:32:14.586 --> 00:32:18.899
not only a matter of high
culture but that is also

00:32:18.899 --> 00:32:22.815
vernacular,
regional, heterogeneous,

00:32:22.815 --> 00:32:28.440
popular, and includes in it all
kinds of materials.

00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:34.595
And you remember the quotation
I pointed to in the first day of

00:32:34.595 --> 00:32:39.460
class when I quoted from Moore's
poem "Poetry"?

00:32:39.460 --> 00:32:43.455
And she was talking about all
the things that should go in

00:32:43.455 --> 00:32:47.029
poetry, even business documents
and school books.

00:32:47.029 --> 00:32:51.046
Well, America is a place where
you can put those things in

00:32:51.046 --> 00:32:54.204
poems.
This is a proud,

00:32:54.204 --> 00:32:58.420
also a comical principle.
 

00:32:58.420 --> 00:33:01.340
It's a democratic principle for
Moore.

00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:06.039
Is it maybe also a feminist one?
 

00:33:06.039 --> 00:33:12.940
I think so, in so far as Moore
defines what is American as

00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:20.567
specifically and distinctively a
non-hierarchical point of view:

00:33:20.567 --> 00:33:24.607
that is,
not so much a woman's point of

00:33:24.607 --> 00:33:29.782
view so much as a point of view
that accommodates that of the

00:33:29.782 --> 00:33:34.261
woman among others,
within a multiplicity of human

00:33:34.261 --> 00:33:37.273
perspectives and,
in fact, non-human

00:33:37.273 --> 00:33:41.636
perspectives.
She's serious about including

00:33:41.636 --> 00:33:43.799
those cats and dogs.
 

00:33:43.799 --> 00:33:46.680
Why is the poem called
"England"?

00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:52.231
By incorporating the title into
the first line of the poem,

00:33:52.231 --> 00:33:55.390
Moore makes it seem accidental.
 

00:33:55.390 --> 00:34:03.190
The device foregrounds Moore's
concision and practicality.

00:34:03.190 --> 00:34:07.190
Why waste any extra words on
the title?

00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:10.785
Pound wants you to use no word
that does not contribute to the

00:34:10.785 --> 00:34:15.139
presentation;
okay, then we'll make the title

00:34:15.139 --> 00:34:18.610
part of the presentation,
too.

00:34:18.610 --> 00:34:25.518
The gesture is also of a piece,
I think, with Moore's distrust

00:34:25.518 --> 00:34:28.010
of hierarchy itself.
 

00:34:28.010 --> 00:34:32.135
She says, in effect,
the title is not more important

00:34:32.135 --> 00:34:34.400
than the rest of the poem.
 

00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:39.639
It doesn't stand outside it or
above it, it's just part of it;

00:34:39.639 --> 00:34:44.437
just as Moore found it slavish
and probably pretentious to

00:34:44.437 --> 00:34:48.730
capitalize the first word of
every line of verse.

00:34:48.730 --> 00:34:51.254
She wants to,
in that sense,

00:34:51.254 --> 00:34:56.489
give dignity to the lowercase,
to non-capital letters.

00:34:56.489 --> 00:35:01.809
At the same time Moore is very
wily and clever.

00:35:01.809 --> 00:35:06.269
England really is important
here;

00:35:06.269 --> 00:35:10.408
that is, it's not merely the
first nation in an arbitrarily

00:35:10.408 --> 00:35:13.495
arranged list.
She's defending America and

00:35:13.495 --> 00:35:17.890
American English specifically
against the noted superiority of

00:35:17.890 --> 00:35:22.142
England and English literature,
where of course Pound,

00:35:22.142 --> 00:35:26.892
Eliot, Frost and others had
gone to establish themselves as

00:35:26.892 --> 00:35:30.451
poets.
And to this extent she's saying

00:35:30.451 --> 00:35:35.367
that the title is not so
important that it stands above

00:35:35.367 --> 00:35:38.587
the poem;
England is not so important

00:35:38.587 --> 00:35:41.659
that it stands over and above
America.

00:35:41.659 --> 00:35:45.541
And in this sense the title,
in fact, turns out to be

00:35:45.541 --> 00:35:49.199
important and to give us
important information,

00:35:49.199 --> 00:35:55.227
because she's out here to make
England less important and to

00:35:55.227 --> 00:35:58.190
deny it its pride of place.
 

00:35:58.190 --> 00:36:05.986
Well, we've got just a few
minutes left to start a long,

00:36:05.986 --> 00:36:14.208
difficult and truly marvelous
poem called "An Octopus" that

00:36:14.208 --> 00:36:22.856
exemplifies Moore as a nature
poet and exemplifies many of the

00:36:22.856 --> 00:36:28.810
distinctive features of her
writing.

00:36:28.810 --> 00:36:32.420
Again, this is on page 441.
 

00:36:32.420 --> 00:36:38.530
The title of the poem is the
first line.

00:36:38.530 --> 00:36:43.255
We might think that this is
going to be a poem about an

00:36:43.255 --> 00:36:46.840
octopus.
Well, not exactly.

00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:54.378
In effect, the title is a kind
of riddle that the poem will go

00:36:54.378 --> 00:36:58.210
on and explain and expand on.
 

00:36:58.210 --> 00:37:03.744
It's a poem about Mount
Rainier, Mount Rainier where

00:37:03.744 --> 00:37:08.409
Moore went with her brother John
in 1922,

00:37:08.409 --> 00:37:12.862
that same year that Joyce
published Ulysses and

00:37:12.862 --> 00:37:17.567
Eliot ended the idea of poetry
for ladies in The Waste

00:37:17.567 --> 00:37:21.609
Land.
The poem involves a kind of

00:37:21.609 --> 00:37:28.599
essential contradiction which it
works through in complex ways.

00:37:28.599 --> 00:37:33.472
On the one hand,
the mountain that Moore calls

00:37:33.472 --> 00:37:40.184
an octopus, that she's writing
about here, is something that is

00:37:40.184 --> 00:37:43.579
exactly "other."
It's outside the poet;

00:37:43.579 --> 00:37:48.300
it's out there,
like the sea in "A Grave."

00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:51.560
It's objectified;
it's something Moore has to

00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:55.616
stand apart from,
perhaps try to conquer in the

00:37:55.616 --> 00:38:00.906
form of climbing it or conquer
in the form of representing it

00:38:00.906 --> 00:38:05.009
in her writing.
And yet, in the course of the

00:38:05.009 --> 00:38:09.365
poem, the mountain and its
glacier, which is really the

00:38:09.365 --> 00:38:12.269
octopus that she's talking
about,

00:38:12.269 --> 00:38:17.865
is something that Moore
identifies herself with,

00:38:17.865 --> 00:38:23.579
that comes to look like Moore
in certain ways.

00:38:23.579 --> 00:38:30.019
It comes to be identified with
the force of her art.

00:38:30.019 --> 00:38:35.582
So, it's both a kind of version
of herself and it's a version of

00:38:35.582 --> 00:38:37.789
something "other," too.
 

00:38:37.789 --> 00:38:44.175
The poem is filled with an
extraordinary and bewildering

00:38:44.175 --> 00:38:51.025
detail that evokes the natural
world as one of extraordinary

00:38:51.025 --> 00:38:54.159
and bewildering detail.
 

00:38:54.159 --> 00:38:59.160
At the same time,
it combines and creates a

00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:06.780
fantastic collage of quotation
from a wild variety of sources.

00:39:06.780 --> 00:39:13.252
It's hard to know where to
start and stop in this poem,

00:39:13.252 --> 00:39:15.769
what its parts are.
 

00:39:15.769 --> 00:39:19.433
It's a question that,
in a sense, Moore is asking

00:39:19.433 --> 00:39:21.570
about the mountain itself.
 

00:39:21.570 --> 00:39:26.052
There's in general a kind of
analogy throughout the poem

00:39:26.052 --> 00:39:30.289
between the mountain and the
woman who admires it,

00:39:30.289 --> 00:39:34.611
whose mind itself can seem
octopus-like,

00:39:34.611 --> 00:39:41.371
and reaches out in these long
tentacle-like lines to grasp the

00:39:41.371 --> 00:39:44.042
world,
make it her own,

00:39:44.042 --> 00:39:49.704
freeze it in poetic language,
even while she's insisting on

00:39:49.704 --> 00:39:53.610
the wonderful otherness of the
world.

00:39:53.610 --> 00:39:59.194
I won't start reading now at
the end of class but let me say

00:39:59.194 --> 00:40:05.157
a couple of further things about
the poem and ask you to re-read

00:40:05.157 --> 00:40:10.405
it,
and to, knowing that it's hard,

00:40:10.405 --> 00:40:18.539
re-read it more than once,
and maybe not continuously.

00:40:18.539 --> 00:40:21.559
It's a very hard poem to read
continuously.

00:40:21.559 --> 00:40:26.009
Be sure to read the last
paragraph of it carefully that

00:40:26.009 --> 00:40:27.739
begins on page 444.
 

00:40:27.739 --> 00:40:34.610
And let me say something before
we stop about quotation.

00:40:34.610 --> 00:40:43.177
You remember that the sea in "A
Grave" mocked the rapacious

00:40:43.177 --> 00:40:47.637
collector.
Moore herself was a great

00:40:47.637 --> 00:40:50.061
collector.
She collected,

00:40:50.061 --> 00:40:52.900
among other things,
quotations.

00:40:52.900 --> 00:40:58.330
She engrosses them;
she gathers them to her;

00:40:58.330 --> 00:41:05.960
she masters her reading.
 

00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:10.130
She brings them into this poem
in, as I say,

00:41:10.130 --> 00:41:12.070
a kind of collage.
 

00:41:12.070 --> 00:41:17.060
It gives the poem a kind of,
well, a very strange

00:41:17.060 --> 00:41:20.990
polyvocality.
There's many, many voices here.

00:41:20.990 --> 00:41:22.500
Think of The Waste Land.
 

00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:25.739
Well, Moore rivals it in this
poem;

00:41:25.739 --> 00:41:30.732
many voices that again
democratically allow for,

00:41:30.732 --> 00:41:34.556
you could say,
multiple perspectives,

00:41:34.556 --> 00:41:37.849
multiple kinds of material.
 

00:41:37.849 --> 00:41:44.518
Unlike The Waste Land,
Moore is not quoting only high

00:41:44.518 --> 00:41:49.831
art sources by and large;
well, Eliot has his popular

00:41:49.831 --> 00:41:53.264
culture, too,
but we know that it's pretty

00:41:53.264 --> 00:41:55.610
much a high culture poem.
 

00:41:55.610 --> 00:41:59.770
Well, Moore is making her poem
out of magazines,

00:41:59.770 --> 00:42:04.550
out of a pamphlet from The
National Parks Portfolio,

00:42:04.550 --> 00:42:11.880
through her reading in Ruskin
and many other sources.

00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:16.064
And it treats those various
texts, you could say,

00:42:16.064 --> 00:42:20.074
non-hierarchically,
without a kind of regard to

00:42:20.074 --> 00:42:22.079
generic valuations.
 

00:42:22.079 --> 00:42:26.697
She doesn't play off high and
low as Eliot does in "A Game of

00:42:26.697 --> 00:42:28.389
Chess," for example.
 

00:42:28.389 --> 00:42:33.360
It makes the sources of poetic
language and of poetry

00:42:33.360 --> 00:42:39.000
continuous with ordinary life,
her activities of reading;

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:43.591
and at the same time,
it makes Moore's inspiration

00:42:43.591 --> 00:42:47.808
deeply personal,
because who else but Marianne

00:42:47.808 --> 00:42:51.650
Moore would have read all this
stuff,

00:42:51.650 --> 00:42:54.769
or just these things?
 

00:42:54.769 --> 00:43:03.580
Like Pound, a kind of visionary
scholar who found his muse in a

00:43:03.580 --> 00:43:09.254
translated Homer,
Moore, knowing that literary

00:43:09.254 --> 00:43:13.822
inspiration is not confined to
any locality,

00:43:13.822 --> 00:43:18.710
finds it all over the place in
her reading.

00:43:18.710 --> 00:43:21.933
But again, what she's reading
is something different from

00:43:21.933 --> 00:43:25.145
Eliot and Pound.
And I'll say more about that

00:43:25.145 --> 00:43:26.000
next time.

00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:03.206
Professor Christine
Hayes: So we were talking

00:00:03.206 --> 00:00:05.536
last time about the
Deuteronomistic historian and

00:00:05.536 --> 00:00:08.109
their interpretation of the
events that befell Israel,

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:11.022
a very special interpretation
that would make it possible for

00:00:11.022 --> 00:00:13.838
Israel to remain intact after
the destruction of the state,

00:00:13.838 --> 00:00:16.800
the temple and the national
basis of their society.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.874
And according to the
Deuteronomist,

00:00:18.874 --> 00:00:21.803
it's the sin of idolatry,
specifically the sin of

00:00:21.803 --> 00:00:25.160
idolatry and particularly the
idolatry of the king,

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.188
for which the nation is
punished with exile and

00:00:28.188 --> 00:00:30.421
destruction.
Punishments come for other

00:00:30.421 --> 00:00:32.640
sorts of sins,
but the national punishment of

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.161
exile and destruction follows
upon the idolatry and

00:00:35.161 --> 00:00:37.330
particularly the idolatry of the
king.

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:41.087
So in the book of 2 Kings,
a king who permits sacrifice

00:00:41.087 --> 00:00:45.193
only at the Jerusalem Temple is
praised no matter what other

00:00:45.193 --> 00:00:49.104
faults he may or may not have,
and one who does not is

00:00:49.104 --> 00:00:53.200
condemned, no matter what other
accomplishments he may have to

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.340
his credit.
Now the Deuteronomistic

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.314
historian is aware that the
historical record doesn't lend

00:00:58.314 --> 00:01:01.079
itself very easily to this kind
of interpretation.

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.089
Because there are some good
kings who reigned very briefly,

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:06.580
and there are some very bad
kings, on their view,

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.500
who reigned for a very long
time.

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:09.670
Manasseh is a case in point.
 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.054
He reigned for over 50 years
and is viewed as the most wicked

00:01:13.054 --> 00:01:15.401
of all kings.
Sometimes disaster would strike

00:01:15.401 --> 00:01:18.209
right after the rule of a king
that the Deuteronomist would

00:01:18.209 --> 00:01:21.260
view as a good king because of
their faithfulness to Yahweh,

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:26.267
and sometimes it would not
strike after the rule of a king

00:01:26.267 --> 00:01:29.430
that was viewed to be very
wicked.

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.441
So the Deuteronomist sounds the
theme of delayed punishment--

00:01:33.441 --> 00:01:36.250
delayed punishment,
deferred punishment.

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.538
So for example,
Solomon's misdeeds in allowing

00:01:39.538 --> 00:01:43.630
the building of altars for the
worship of foreign gods to

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.469
please his many wives,
his foreign wives,

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:48.660
is blamed for the division of
the kingdoms,

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.791
but the punishment was deferred
until after his death and the

00:01:51.791 --> 00:01:54.426
time of his sons,
and then you have this

00:01:54.426 --> 00:01:57.245
split between north and south
with Jeroboam and Rehoboam

00:01:57.245 --> 00:01:58.745
reigning,
respectively,

00:01:58.745 --> 00:02:00.379
in the north and south.
 

00:02:00.379 --> 00:02:03.904
The Deuteronomist sees Israel's
defeat at the hands of the

00:02:03.904 --> 00:02:07.737
Assyrians in 722 as deferred or
delayed punishment for the sins

00:02:07.737 --> 00:02:10.296
of Jeroboam I.
Jeroboam I, 922 or so,

00:02:10.296 --> 00:02:13.782
came to the throne and
installed two cultic centers at

00:02:13.782 --> 00:02:16.610
Dan and Beth-El,
erecting golden calves.

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.968
This is seen as a sin,
for which the nation was

00:02:19.968 --> 00:02:21.939
punished 200 years later.
 

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:25.356
As for the southern kingdom of
Judah: you had some good kings

00:02:25.356 --> 00:02:28.090
in the view of the Deuteronomist
in the south.

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.580
Hezekiah--he's judged to be a
good king;

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.285
he instituted sweeping reforms
and got rid of idolatrous altars

00:02:34.285 --> 00:02:37.573
and managed to maintain Judah's
independence against the

00:02:37.573 --> 00:02:39.548
Assyrians.
But his son Manasseh,

00:02:39.548 --> 00:02:42.314
who reigned for a large part of
the seventh century,

00:02:42.314 --> 00:02:44.430
is viewed as extraordinarily
wicked.

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.988
He turned the Jerusalem temple
into a pagan temple,

00:02:47.988 --> 00:02:52.045
and it was a time of great
misery for those who were loyal

00:02:52.045 --> 00:02:54.750
to Yahweh, a time of great
terror.

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.620
And yet, he reigned a long time.
 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.084
His eight-year-old grandson,
Josiah, came to the throne upon

00:03:01.084 --> 00:03:04.490
his death, sometime,
probably, in the 630s.

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:07.650
And the Deuteronomist views
Josiah as a good king.

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.668
We've already heard about,
or read the story which is

00:03:11.668 --> 00:03:15.553
reported in 2 Kings 22,
of the refurbishing of the

00:03:15.553 --> 00:03:19.909
temple, which happens when he's
about 25 or 26 years old;

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:22.692
discovers the book of the law,
reads it, and is distressed

00:03:22.692 --> 00:03:24.840
because its terms are not being
fulfilled.

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.192
And so Josiah orders the
abolition of outlying altars and

00:03:28.192 --> 00:03:30.889
pagan cults.
He brings all of the priests to

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:34.370
Jerusalem and centralizes all
worship there in Jerusalem.

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.015
So in the Deuteronomist's view,
Josiah is believed to be a very

00:03:38.015 --> 00:03:41.072
good king for purging the
country of these idolatrous

00:03:41.072 --> 00:03:43.129
rites and centralizing worship.
 

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:47.870
But the sin of Manasseh was too
great and it had to be punished.

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.184
So a prophetess,
a prophetess named Hulda,

00:03:51.184 --> 00:03:56.034
tells Josiah that God plans to
bring evil punishment on Judah

00:03:56.034 --> 00:03:59.575
for these sins,
but it will be after Josiah's

00:03:59.575 --> 00:04:02.409
lifetime as something of a mercy
to him.

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:04.104
And, in fact,
it's in the next generation

00:04:04.104 --> 00:04:04.909
that Judah falls.
 

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:09.106
In 586 the walls of Jerusalem
are breached and the Temple is

00:04:09.106 --> 00:04:11.879
destroyed, and the king at that
time,

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:15.546
King Zedekiah,
is blinded and taken in chains

00:04:15.546 --> 00:04:17.879
into exile with his court.
 

00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:20.439
And only the poor are left
behind.

00:04:20.439 --> 00:04:25.642
This is the Deuteronomist's
attempt to account for these

00:04:25.642 --> 00:04:29.899
anomalies within their
historiosophic view.

00:04:29.899 --> 00:04:33.170
And the result of the
Deuteronomist's interpretation

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:35.898
was remarkable.
Because if the defeat of the

00:04:35.898 --> 00:04:39.293
nation were to be seen as the
defeat of the nation's god by

00:04:39.293 --> 00:04:41.399
the god of the conquering
nation,

00:04:41.399 --> 00:04:44.361
then the Israelites would have
turned from the worship of their

00:04:44.361 --> 00:04:47.480
god, Yahweh,
and embraced the new ascendant

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.373
god Marduk.
And undoubtedly,

00:04:49.373 --> 00:04:51.600
there were Israelites who did
do this.

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.834
That would have been the
argument of history in their

00:04:54.834 --> 00:04:57.490
view.
But not all did.

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:01.424
For some, defeat did not lead
to despair or apostasy because

00:05:01.424 --> 00:05:05.158
it could be explained by the
likes of the Deuteronomistic

00:05:05.158 --> 00:05:09.026
historian or the Deuteronomistic
School as fitting into the

00:05:09.026 --> 00:05:10.759
monotheistic scheme.
 

00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:14.603
This did not impugn God's
kingship or lordship over the

00:05:14.603 --> 00:05:16.810
universe, it was proof of it.
 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:19.776
God was punishing Israel for
the sin of idolatry,

00:05:19.776 --> 00:05:22.310
which was in violation of his
covenant.

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:24.940
And to punish Israel,
he had raised the Babylonians.

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:26.779
They were merely his tool.
 

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:31.191
The historiosophy of the
Deuteronomistic historian finds

00:05:31.191 --> 00:05:34.240
it classic expression in 2 Kings
17.

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.881
I'm going to skim through
sections of it so you can see

00:05:36.881 --> 00:05:38.740
the argument that's laid out
there:

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:41.259
In the ninth year of
Hoshea, the king of Assyria

00:05:41.259 --> 00:05:43.970
captured Samaria [the capital of
the northern kingdom].

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:47.459
He deported the Israelites to
Assyria and settled them

00:05:47.459 --> 00:05:49.040
in…[various places].
 

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:51.275
This happened because the
Israelites sinned against the

00:05:51.275 --> 00:05:53.014
Lord their God,
who had freed them from the

00:05:53.014 --> 00:05:55.425
land of Egypt,
from the hand of Pharaoh king

00:05:55.425 --> 00:05:57.362
of Egypt.
They worshipped other gods and

00:05:57.362 --> 00:06:00.269
followed…the customs which the
kings of Israel had practiced.

00:06:00.269 --> 00:06:02.599
Putting, again,
the blame on the kings as the

00:06:02.599 --> 00:06:03.870
head of this idolatry.
 

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:06.345
The Israelites committed
against the Lord their God acts

00:06:06.345 --> 00:06:08.415
which were not right:
They built for themselves

00:06:08.415 --> 00:06:10.079
shrines in all their
settlements,

00:06:10.079 --> 00:06:12.370
from watchtowers to fortified
cities;

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:15.820
they set up pillars and sacred
posts for themselves on every

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:18.160
lofty hill and under every leafy
tree;

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.761
and they offered sacrifices
there, at all the shrines,

00:06:20.761 --> 00:06:23.608
like the nations whom the Lord
had driven into exile before

00:06:23.608 --> 00:06:25.228
them.
So now he's going to follow

00:06:25.228 --> 00:06:27.759
through since they behaved the
same way, to drive them into

00:06:27.759 --> 00:06:29.654
exile also.
They committed wicked acts to

00:06:29.654 --> 00:06:31.514
vex the Lord,
and they worshipped fetishes,

00:06:31.514 --> 00:06:33.374
concerning which the Lord had
said to them,

00:06:33.374 --> 00:06:34.879
"You must not do this thing."
 

00:06:34.879 --> 00:06:38.289
The Lord warned Israel and
Judah by every prophet [and]

00:06:38.289 --> 00:06:40.492
every seer,
So God didn't just stand by

00:06:40.492 --> 00:06:41.929
idly.
He was constantly sending

00:06:41.929 --> 00:06:44.277
prophets, messengers to tell
them to turn back to the

00:06:44.277 --> 00:06:46.281
covenant.
And we'll start talking about

00:06:46.281 --> 00:06:47.389
those prophets today.
 

00:06:47.389 --> 00:06:49.354
He sent warnings by "every
prophet [and]

00:06:49.354 --> 00:06:51.313
every seer,"
saying, "Turn back from your

00:06:51.313 --> 00:06:53.730
wicked ways, and observe My
commandments and My laws,

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:56.419
according to all the Teaching
that I commanded your fathers

00:06:56.419 --> 00:06:58.830
and that I transmitted to you
through My servants the

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:00.860
prophets."
But they did not obey;

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:03.338
they stiffened their necks,
like their fathers who did not

00:07:03.338 --> 00:07:04.860
have faith in the Lord their
God;

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:07.348
they spurned His laws and the
covenant that He had made with

00:07:07.348 --> 00:07:09.500
their fathers and the warnings
He had given them.

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:12.937
They went after delusion and
were deluded;…they made molten

00:07:12.937 --> 00:07:15.000
idols for themselves--two
calves--

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.478
and specifically now,
the sin of Jeroboam at Dan and

00:07:17.478 --> 00:07:19.810
Beth-El, two calves,
"and they made a sacred post

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:22.240
and they bowed down to all the
host of heaven,

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:23.420
and they worshipped Baal."
 

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:25.379
(We'll hear more about that
today.)

00:07:25.379 --> 00:07:28.160
They consigned their sons and
daughters to the fire;

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:31.207
they practiced augury and
divination, and gave themselves

00:07:31.207 --> 00:07:34.310
over to what was displeasing to
the Lord and vexed him.

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:36.667
The Lord was incensed at Israel
and he banished them from His

00:07:36.667 --> 00:07:38.969
presence;
none was left but the tribe of

00:07:38.969 --> 00:07:40.747
Judah alone.
Nor did Judah keep the

00:07:40.747 --> 00:07:42.329
commandments of the Lord their
God;

00:07:42.329 --> 00:07:44.699
they followed the customs that
Israel had practiced.

00:07:44.699 --> 00:07:47.291
So the Lord spurned all the
offspring of Israel and He

00:07:47.291 --> 00:07:49.736
afflicted them and delivered
them into the hands of

00:07:49.736 --> 00:07:52.292
plunderers,
and finally He cast them out

00:07:52.292 --> 00:07:55.420
from His presence.
It's a very depressing ending

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:58.420
of things that started so
auspiciously back in Genesis 1.

00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:01.780
But if the Deuteronomist laid
the blame for the tragic history

00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:04.920
of the two kingdoms at the door
of the sin of idolatry,

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:07.327
and particularly the idolatry
of the royal house,

00:08:07.327 --> 00:08:10.135
a different answer will be
provided by Israel's classical

00:08:10.135 --> 00:08:13.069
prophets--no less an answer,
no less an interpretation,

00:08:13.069 --> 00:08:16.034
and no less an interpretation
that was intended to shore up

00:08:16.034 --> 00:08:19.459
faith in this God that one might
think had abandoned His people.

00:08:19.459 --> 00:08:22.811
We'll be turning to the
prophetic answer to this great

00:08:22.811 --> 00:08:26.290
crisis that faced the Israelites
in the next lecture.

00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:28.852
In this lecture,
I first want to talk about the

00:08:28.852 --> 00:08:32.194
phenomenon of prophecy and some
of the prophets who appear in

00:08:32.194 --> 00:08:33.809
the historical narrative.
 

00:08:33.809 --> 00:08:36.896
So, in the historical books
that we've been looking at in

00:08:36.896 --> 00:08:40.480
the section of the Bible we call
the Former Prophets--remember,

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:43.534
the section called the Prophets
we divide into Former Prophets

00:08:43.534 --> 00:08:45.837
and Latter Prophets:
the section we call Former

00:08:45.837 --> 00:08:47.789
Prophets is a historical
narrative;

00:08:47.789 --> 00:08:50.811
it runs from Joshua through 2
Kings, and it reads like a

00:08:50.811 --> 00:08:54.181
narrative--in that material,
you have several prophets who

00:08:54.181 --> 00:08:57.625
appear, and they play a very
important role in the national

00:08:57.625 --> 00:08:59.904
drama.
The prophets of the tenth

00:08:59.904 --> 00:09:04.092
century, the ninth century BCE
were associated with religious

00:09:04.092 --> 00:09:06.120
shrines.
On occasion they were

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:08.100
associated with the royal court.
 

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:10.888
But starting in about the
eighth century,

00:09:10.888 --> 00:09:14.793
you have prophets whose words
were eventually set down in

00:09:14.793 --> 00:09:17.540
writing,
and they come to be in the

00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:22.021
books that now bear the names of
the prophets to whom they are

00:09:22.021 --> 00:09:24.279
attributed.
So these prophets,

00:09:24.279 --> 00:09:27.763
the ones whose words get
recorded in books that bear

00:09:27.763 --> 00:09:30.257
their name,
these prophets we call the

00:09:30.257 --> 00:09:32.801
literary prophets or the
classical prophets,

00:09:32.801 --> 00:09:36.350
in contrast to the prophets who
are characters in the stories

00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:39.129
that we read from Genesis
through 2 Kings.

00:09:39.129 --> 00:09:40.950
So there are two kinds of
prophets.

00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:43.695
The literary prophets:
those books are collected

00:09:43.695 --> 00:09:46.850
together in the section we call
the Latter Prophets.

00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:48.090
I hope this is making sense.
 

00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:50.775
So Former Prophets is the
historical narrative,

00:09:50.775 --> 00:09:54.219
which happens to feature kings
and prophets as characters in

00:09:54.219 --> 00:09:56.622
the narrative.
The Latter Prophets,

00:09:56.622 --> 00:10:00.206
those are the books of
prophetic oracles that bear the

00:10:00.206 --> 00:10:03.993
name of the person who gave the
utterance, or the oracle.

00:10:03.993 --> 00:10:05.706
Okay?
And as I just said,

00:10:05.706 --> 00:10:08.432
the literary prophets,
just like the Deuteronomist,

00:10:08.432 --> 00:10:11.377
struggle to make sense of
Israel's suffering and defeat

00:10:11.377 --> 00:10:14.103
and to come up with an
explanation and a message of

00:10:14.103 --> 00:10:17.042
consolation.
And we will get to that next

00:10:17.042 --> 00:10:18.937
time.
Today we'll look at the

00:10:18.937 --> 00:10:22.494
phenomenon of prophecy in
ancient Israel by comparing or

00:10:22.494 --> 00:10:26.179
examining narratives in Samuel
and Kings particularly,

00:10:26.179 --> 00:10:28.480
narratives that feature
prophets.

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:31.273
And that will provide very
important background for the

00:10:31.273 --> 00:10:33.393
next lecture,
when we turn to the books of

00:10:33.393 --> 00:10:36.290
the literary or classical
prophets and the themes of that

00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:38.646
literature.
Now, prophecy was very

00:10:38.646 --> 00:10:41.129
widespread in the Ancient Near
East.

00:10:41.129 --> 00:10:43.884
It took different forms in
different societies,

00:10:43.884 --> 00:10:45.860
but ultimately very widespread.
 

00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:50.488
We know of ecstatic prophets
from Second Millennium BCE texts

00:10:50.488 --> 00:10:54.671
in Mesopotamia.
Seventh-century Assyria also

00:10:54.671 --> 00:10:57.029
has ecstatic prophets.
 

00:10:57.029 --> 00:11:02.522
Their primary focus was on
delivering oracles for kings,

00:11:02.522 --> 00:11:04.519
usually favorable.
 

00:11:04.519 --> 00:11:08.320
It was always wise to give a
favorable oracle to your king.

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:11.047
And we have ecstatic prophecy
in the Bible also,

00:11:11.047 --> 00:11:13.600
among the earliest prophets in
particular.

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:16.963
The term ecstasy,
when it's used in this context,

00:11:16.963 --> 00:11:20.816
refers to the state of being
overcome with such powerful

00:11:20.816 --> 00:11:24.110
emotions that reason seems to be
suspended,

00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:27.317
self-control is suspended,
what we might think of as,

00:11:27.317 --> 00:11:29.230
you know, normative behavior.
 

00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:30.748
These things,
normal behavior,

00:11:30.748 --> 00:11:31.899
these are suspended.
 

00:11:31.899 --> 00:11:34.990
Ecstatics would employ music
and dance;

00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:41.490
they would induce a sort of
emotional seizure or frenzy.

00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:44.394
They would often be left
writhing and raving,

00:11:44.394 --> 00:11:48.221
and the Bible attributes this
kind of ecstatic state to the

00:11:48.221 --> 00:11:51.056
Spirit of the Lord,
the Spirit of Yahweh,

00:11:51.056 --> 00:11:54.253
which falls upon a prophet or
rushes upon a prophet,

00:11:54.253 --> 00:11:57.575
comes upon a prophet and
transforms him then into some

00:11:57.575 --> 00:12:01.399
sort of carrier or instrument of
the Divine Will or the Divine

00:12:01.399 --> 00:12:03.960
message.
We'll see that we have bizarre

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:05.960
behavior among many of the
prophets.

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:09.941
We even have bizarre behavior
among many of the later literary

00:12:09.941 --> 00:12:11.960
prophets.
Ezekiel, for example,

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:14.872
will engage in all kinds of
unusual, outrageous,

00:12:14.872 --> 00:12:18.464
dramatic behavior as a vehicle
for the communication of his

00:12:18.464 --> 00:12:20.557
message.
And I think this is the

00:12:20.557 --> 00:12:23.693
heritage of the ecstatic
prophecy that was so much a part

00:12:23.693 --> 00:12:25.710
of Ancient Near Eastern
prophecy.

00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:29.600
But not all biblical prophecy
has this ecstatic character.

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:32.607
The Hebrew word for prophet is
a navi,

00:12:32.607 --> 00:12:36.434
and the word navi seems
to mean one who is called,

00:12:36.434 --> 00:12:38.690
or perhaps one who announces.
 

00:12:38.690 --> 00:12:42.214
That's important because it
signals to us that a prophet is

00:12:42.214 --> 00:12:45.009
someone who is called to
proclaim a message,

00:12:45.009 --> 00:12:47.860
to announce something,
called by God to carry a

00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:50.506
message.
And so in the Bible we have

00:12:50.506 --> 00:12:54.559
this phenomenon of what we call
"apostolic prophecy."

00:12:54.559 --> 00:12:56.779
An apostle is merely a
messenger.

00:12:56.779 --> 00:12:59.080
The word "apostle" means
messenger, one sent with a

00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:01.529
message.
So apostolic prophecy--this

00:13:01.529 --> 00:13:03.740
refers to messenger prophets.
 

00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:06.309
They are called by God and
charged with a mission.

00:13:06.309 --> 00:13:08.879
They can even be elected
against their will.

00:13:08.879 --> 00:13:12.360
They must bring the word of God
to the world.

00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:16.436
This is very different from
prophets who are consulted by a

00:13:16.436 --> 00:13:19.600
client and given a fee to divine
something.

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:20.480
This is different.
 

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:26.015
This is the deity now charging
a prophet with a message to a

00:13:26.015 --> 00:13:28.813
people.
So these apostolic prophets are

00:13:28.813 --> 00:13:32.594
represented in the Bible as the
instrument of God's desire to

00:13:32.594 --> 00:13:36.059
reveal himself and to reveal his
will to his people.

00:13:36.059 --> 00:13:38.821
And many scholars have noted
that, in a way,

00:13:38.821 --> 00:13:42.738
Moses is really the first in a
long line of apostolic prophets

00:13:42.738 --> 00:13:44.844
in the Bible.
In some ways,

00:13:44.844 --> 00:13:49.446
his call and his response are
paradigmatic for some of these

00:13:49.446 --> 00:13:51.629
later classical prophets.
 

00:13:51.629 --> 00:13:54.534
In many of the literary
prophets you will read,

00:13:54.534 --> 00:13:57.312
they will contain some account
of their call,

00:13:57.312 --> 00:14:00.279
of the sudden,
dramatic encounter with God.

00:14:00.279 --> 00:14:05.440
Usually the call consists of
certain standard stages.

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:08.379
You first have this unexpected
encounter with God.

00:14:08.379 --> 00:14:13.985
Maybe a vision of some kind or
a voice that issues a summons or

00:14:13.985 --> 00:14:16.626
a calling.
And then you have the

00:14:16.626 --> 00:14:18.850
reluctance of the individual.
 

00:14:18.850 --> 00:14:20.940
And that was also paradigmatic
with Moses, wasn't it?

00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:24.057
The reluctance of the
individual concerned to answer

00:14:24.057 --> 00:14:27.297
this, but ultimately the
individual is overwhelmed and

00:14:27.297 --> 00:14:30.720
eventually surrenders to God and
his persuasiveness.

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:32.899
That happens in many of the
prophetic books.

00:14:32.899 --> 00:14:36.660
So in the Bible this kind of
apostolic prophecy is a little

00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:38.929
different from ecstatic
prophecy.

00:14:38.929 --> 00:14:41.250
It's also distinct from
divination.

00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:46.579
Divination is an attempt to
uncover the divine through some

00:14:46.579 --> 00:14:49.059
technique, or,
excuse me,

00:14:49.059 --> 00:14:51.710
the divine will,
through some technique,

00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:55.039
perhaps the manipulation of
certain substances,

00:14:55.039 --> 00:14:58.950
perhaps inspecting the entrails
of a sacrificed animal.

00:14:58.950 --> 00:15:03.838
Divination of this type as well
as sorcery and spell casting and

00:15:03.838 --> 00:15:08.028
consulting with ghosts and
spirits are all condemned by

00:15:08.028 --> 00:15:10.869
Deuteronomy.
This is a very important part

00:15:10.869 --> 00:15:14.233
of the Deuteronomist's diatribe
against the practices of other

00:15:14.233 --> 00:15:16.532
nations.
But the fact that Deuteronomy

00:15:16.532 --> 00:15:19.626
polemicizes so vehemently
against these practices is a

00:15:19.626 --> 00:15:22.778
sure sign that they were
practiced--they were practiced

00:15:22.778 --> 00:15:24.179
at a popular level.
 

00:15:24.179 --> 00:15:27.315
This is probably what
Israelite-Judean religion

00:15:27.315 --> 00:15:29.360
consisted of to some degree.
 

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:31.983
And some of you will be looking
in section, I know,

00:15:31.983 --> 00:15:35.131
at the story of the Witch of
Endor--when Saul goes to a witch

00:15:35.131 --> 00:15:38.902
to conjure up the spirit of,
the ghost of Samuel to consult

00:15:38.902 --> 00:15:42.528
with him.
Moreover, we do have divination

00:15:42.528 --> 00:15:45.080
in the Yahweh cult itself.
 

00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:48.220
But this was performed by
priests.

00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:53.059
They consulted some sort of
divinely designated oracular

00:15:53.059 --> 00:15:54.820
object or objects.
 

00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:57.340
We call these the urim
and the tummim,

00:15:57.340 --> 00:16:00.009
which should be familiar to all
of you here at Yale.

00:16:00.009 --> 00:16:01.595
But urim and
tummim are usually

00:16:01.595 --> 00:16:03.433
untranslated in your text,
because actually we don't

00:16:03.433 --> 00:16:04.549
really know what they mean.
 

00:16:04.549 --> 00:16:06.949
They might be related to the
word for light,

00:16:06.949 --> 00:16:08.959
which is or,
and the word for,

00:16:08.959 --> 00:16:11.358
you know, integrity,
perhaps, or perfection,

00:16:11.358 --> 00:16:12.809
which is tam.
 

00:16:12.809 --> 00:16:15.263
It's probably something like
abracadabra,

00:16:15.263 --> 00:16:18.082
a little bit of a nonsense
syllable that plays on words

00:16:18.082 --> 00:16:19.440
that did have meaning.
 

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:21.093
We don't really know what the
urim and the

00:16:21.093 --> 00:16:22.540
tummim were,
but they are said to be

00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:23.868
assigned by God.
We think they,

00:16:23.868 --> 00:16:26.603
it may have been colored stones
that were manipulated in some

00:16:26.603 --> 00:16:29.201
way by the priest to give a "yes
or no" determination to a

00:16:29.201 --> 00:16:31.374
question.
But these were said to be

00:16:31.374 --> 00:16:34.811
assigned by God as a means that
he himself authorizes for

00:16:34.811 --> 00:16:36.100
divining his will.
 

00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:39.059
And so, the Deuteronomist
accepts these.

00:16:39.059 --> 00:16:41.115
But in general,
it's the view of the

00:16:41.115 --> 00:16:43.700
Deuteronomistic historian that
divination,

00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:45.842
sorcery and the like are not
only prohibited,

00:16:45.842 --> 00:16:48.519
they're quite distinct from the
activity of prophets.

00:16:48.519 --> 00:16:52.276
That's not what the prophets
were about, according to the

00:16:52.276 --> 00:16:54.490
Deuteronomistic representation.
 

00:16:54.490 --> 00:16:58.799
The Hebrew prophet wasn't
primarily a fortuneteller.

00:16:58.799 --> 00:17:01.659
And I think this is a very
common misconception.

00:17:01.659 --> 00:17:03.573
The navi,
the prophet,

00:17:03.573 --> 00:17:07.537
was addressing a very specific
historical situation and was

00:17:07.537 --> 00:17:10.339
addressing it in very concrete
terms.

00:17:10.339 --> 00:17:14.181
He was revealing God's
immediate intentions as a

00:17:14.181 --> 00:17:17.450
response to the present
circumstances.

00:17:17.450 --> 00:17:20.927
And the purpose of doing this
was to inspire the people to

00:17:20.927 --> 00:17:24.710
change, to come back to faithful
observance of the covenant.

00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:28.884
Any predictions that the
prophet might make had reference

00:17:28.884 --> 00:17:32.686
to the immediate future as a
response to the present

00:17:32.686 --> 00:17:35.297
situation.
So in reality the prophet's

00:17:35.297 --> 00:17:38.779
message was a message about the
present, what is wrong now,

00:17:38.779 --> 00:17:43.456
what has to be done to avert
the impending doom or to avert a

00:17:43.456 --> 00:17:46.645
future calamity?
There were some women prophets

00:17:46.645 --> 00:17:48.743
in Israel.
None of them are found among

00:17:48.743 --> 00:17:51.321
the literary prophets,
that is to say none of those

00:17:51.321 --> 00:17:54.518
books bearing the names of the
prophets who uttered the oracles

00:17:54.518 --> 00:17:56.220
in them are named for women.
 

00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:58.686
So we have no women among the
literary prophets,

00:17:58.686 --> 00:18:01.835
but you do have prophetic or
prophesying women besides Miriam

00:18:01.835 --> 00:18:02.990
in the Pentateuch.
 

00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:06.323
There's also Deborah,
who was a tribal leader and a

00:18:06.323 --> 00:18:08.789
prophet featured in Judges 4 and
5.

00:18:08.789 --> 00:18:11.852
I mentioned Hulda,
her advice is sought during the

00:18:11.852 --> 00:18:13.290
reign of King Josiah.
 

00:18:13.290 --> 00:18:14.750
And you also have Noadiah.
 

00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:17.009
Noadiah prophesied in the
post-exilic period.

00:18:17.009 --> 00:18:22.339
So this doesn't seem to be
limited to males.

00:18:22.339 --> 00:18:25.870
Prophecy and kingship are
closely connected in ancient

00:18:25.870 --> 00:18:28.214
Israel.
And this is going to be very

00:18:28.214 --> 00:18:29.642
important.
You'll recall,

00:18:29.642 --> 00:18:31.871
first of all,
that the king is the anointed

00:18:31.871 --> 00:18:33.993
one of Yahweh,
and it's the prophet who's

00:18:33.993 --> 00:18:35.319
doing the anointing.
 

00:18:35.319 --> 00:18:39.141
And that makes the connection
between kingship and prophecy

00:18:39.141 --> 00:18:41.518
quite strong.
If you think about Israel's

00:18:41.518 --> 00:18:43.936
first two kings,
you also see a strong link with

00:18:43.936 --> 00:18:45.480
the phenomenon of prophecy.
 

00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:48.184
The first king,
Saul, who was anointed by the

00:18:48.184 --> 00:18:50.029
prophet Samuel,
is in addition,

00:18:50.029 --> 00:18:53.717
said to have prophesied himself
in the manner of the ecstatic

00:18:53.717 --> 00:18:56.341
prophets.
When he is anointed king,

00:18:56.341 --> 00:18:59.200
he's then seized by the spirit
of Yahweh.

00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:03.180
He joins a band of men--and
this is in 1 Samuel 10:5;

00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:06.498
they're playing harp,
tambourine, flute and lyre,

00:19:06.498 --> 00:19:10.369
and he joins them and this
induces an ecstatic frenzy,

00:19:10.369 --> 00:19:12.896
a religious frenzy,
that transforms him into

00:19:12.896 --> 00:19:15.069
another man, according to the
text.

00:19:15.069 --> 00:19:18.091
And on another occasion during
his ecstatic prophesying,

00:19:18.091 --> 00:19:19.630
Saul strips himself naked.
 

00:19:19.630 --> 00:19:22.954
We have other accounts in the
Bible of ecstatic prophets who

00:19:22.954 --> 00:19:24.869
would engage in self-laceration.
 

00:19:24.869 --> 00:19:28.044
David, the second king,
is also said to prophesy

00:19:28.044 --> 00:19:30.304
himself.
He also receives Yahweh's

00:19:30.304 --> 00:19:33.915
spirit or charisma from time to
time, in addition to being

00:19:33.915 --> 00:19:35.500
anointed by a prophet.
 

00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:38.650
Subsequent monarchs aren't said
to prophesy themselves.

00:19:38.650 --> 00:19:40.079
So that ends really with David.
 

00:19:40.079 --> 00:19:42.450
It's only Saul and David who
are among the prophets.

00:19:42.450 --> 00:19:45.566
But even so,
though subsequent monarchs,

00:19:45.566 --> 00:19:49.962
do not themselves prophesy,
the connection with prophecy

00:19:49.962 --> 00:19:52.279
remains very,
very close.

00:19:52.279 --> 00:19:54.869
And it's exemplified in several
ways.

00:19:54.869 --> 00:19:59.105
Again, prophets not only anoint
kings, but they also announce

00:19:59.105 --> 00:20:00.799
their fall from power.
 

00:20:00.799 --> 00:20:03.549
They are kingmakers and
king-breakers to some degree.

00:20:03.549 --> 00:20:07.516
Also, you have a remarkable
motif that runs through so much

00:20:07.516 --> 00:20:10.594
of biblical narrative,
and that's the motif of

00:20:10.594 --> 00:20:12.920
prophetic opposition to kings.
 

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:16.400
Every king had his prophetic
thorn in the side.

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:19.920
So you have Samuel against Saul.
 

00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:22.390
You have Nathan against King
David.

00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:23.970
We'll talk about him a bit
later.

00:20:23.970 --> 00:20:26.638
You have other prophets,
Elijah, of course,

00:20:26.638 --> 00:20:28.990
against Ahab,
Micaiah against Ahab.

00:20:28.990 --> 00:20:31.579
You have Elisha against the
House of Ahab.

00:20:31.579 --> 00:20:35.991
Jeremiah is going to also stand
against the king quite

00:20:35.991 --> 00:20:39.083
dramatically.
So that prophetic opposition to

00:20:39.083 --> 00:20:42.414
the monarch, to the king,
sort of God's watchdog over the

00:20:42.414 --> 00:20:44.187
king,
is an important theme

00:20:44.187 --> 00:20:47.089
throughout the stories of the
former prophets.

00:20:47.089 --> 00:20:50.478
And it sets the stage for us to
understand the writings of the

00:20:50.478 --> 00:20:52.589
named prophets that will come
later.

00:20:52.589 --> 00:20:57.381
Those are very often given in
opposition to official policy or

00:20:57.381 --> 00:20:59.922
royal policy.
Very often you have this

00:20:59.922 --> 00:21:03.160
literary motif that introduces
the prophet's opposition.

00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:07.523
The Word of the Lord came to X,
prophet X, against Y,

00:21:07.523 --> 00:21:10.561
against king Y.
And then you get the content of

00:21:10.561 --> 00:21:12.953
it: because you have sinned I
will destroy you,

00:21:12.953 --> 00:21:15.450
I will wrest the kingship from
you and so on.

00:21:15.450 --> 00:21:18.472
I want to take a quick look,
though, at some of the roles

00:21:18.472 --> 00:21:21.980
that are played by prophets in
the stories in Samuel and Kings.

00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:25.589
And I have them listed over on
the far side of the board.

00:21:25.589 --> 00:21:29.867
The first thing I want to
consider is the notion of what I

00:21:29.867 --> 00:21:33.319
call "yes-men," as opposed to
true prophets.

00:21:33.319 --> 00:21:37.752
Like the kings of Assyria,
the kings of Israel and Judah

00:21:37.752 --> 00:21:41.460
found it politic to employ
prophetic guilds.

00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:46.037
And in many cases these court
prophets, who were in the king's

00:21:46.037 --> 00:21:50.390
employ, were little more than
endorsers of royal policy.

00:21:50.390 --> 00:21:54.181
So on numerous occasions we see
these professional prophets,

00:21:54.181 --> 00:21:57.459
these royal prophets,
at odds with figures that the

00:21:57.459 --> 00:22:00.190
biblical writer will view as
true prophets.

00:22:00.190 --> 00:22:03.122
They are truly proclaiming the
word of God and not just

00:22:03.122 --> 00:22:04.480
endorsing royal policy.
 

00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:06.890
And they proclaim it whether
the king wants to hear it or

00:22:06.890 --> 00:22:09.000
not, whether the people want to
hear it or not.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:13.099
And the classic example is
Micaiah, the son of Imlah.

00:22:13.099 --> 00:22:16.626
Micaiah prophesies the truth
from Yahweh even though it

00:22:16.626 --> 00:22:20.152
displeases the king and
ultimately is going to cost him

00:22:20.152 --> 00:22:23.810
his freedom--not to be confused
with Micah: Micaiah.

00:22:23.810 --> 00:22:27.180
His story is told in 1 Kings 22.
 

00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:31.162
This story is a pointed
critique of the prophetic

00:22:31.162 --> 00:22:34.896
yes-men who are serving as court
prophets for,

00:22:34.896 --> 00:22:39.460
and automatically endorse the
policy of, King Ahab.

00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:43.085
He's the king in the northern
kingdom of Israel in the ninth

00:22:43.085 --> 00:22:45.328
century.
And during King Ahab's reign,

00:22:45.328 --> 00:22:48.698
the kingdoms of the north and
the south, of Israel and Judah,

00:22:48.698 --> 00:22:50.720
have decided to form an
alliance.

00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:53.806
They want to try to recapture
some of the territory that has

00:22:53.806 --> 00:22:56.160
been lost to the north,
territory in Syria.

00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:59.941
But you didn't undertake any
military expedition without

00:22:59.941 --> 00:23:03.309
first obtaining a favorable word
from the Lord.

00:23:03.309 --> 00:23:07.230
So King Ahab's prophets--and he
has 400 of them--they are

00:23:07.230 --> 00:23:10.696
called, and the King asks them,
"Shall I march upon

00:23:10.696 --> 00:23:13.617
Ramoth-gilead," this is this
region in the north,

00:23:13.617 --> 00:23:15.339
"for battle?
Or shall I not?"

00:23:15.339 --> 00:23:18.226
"March," they said,
"and the Lord will deliver it

00:23:18.226 --> 00:23:19.970
into Your Majesty's hands".
 

00:23:19.970 --> 00:23:22.500
So we see that prophecy here is
an institution.

00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:25.660
It is functioning as a source
of royal advice.

00:23:25.660 --> 00:23:28.094
But the King of Judah,
King Jehoshaphat,

00:23:28.094 --> 00:23:32.089
he had been perhaps hoping for
an oracle against the campaign.

00:23:32.089 --> 00:23:34.358
And he says,
"Isn't there another prophet of

00:23:34.358 --> 00:23:36.680
the Lord here through whom we
can inquire?

00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:40.044
And the King of Israel answered
Jehoshaphat, "There is one more

00:23:40.044 --> 00:23:42.539
man through whom we can inquire
of the Lord;

00:23:42.539 --> 00:23:45.052
but I hate him,
because he never prophesies

00:23:45.052 --> 00:23:48.103
anything favorable about me,
only disaster--Micaiah,

00:23:48.103 --> 00:23:52.161
son of Imlah".
Well, Jehoshaphat insists and

00:23:52.161 --> 00:23:54.319
Micaiah is summoned.
 

00:23:54.319 --> 00:23:56.813
And he's warned by the
messenger who summons him that

00:23:56.813 --> 00:23:59.306
he'd better speak a favorable
word like all the other

00:23:59.306 --> 00:24:00.845
prophets.
The messenger says,

00:24:00.845 --> 00:24:03.834
"the words of the prophets with
one accord are favorable to the

00:24:03.834 --> 00:24:05.628
king.
Let your word be like the word

00:24:05.628 --> 00:24:07.849
of one of them;
and speak favorably" .

00:24:07.849 --> 00:24:10.637
It's almost an open admission
that the prophets are,

00:24:10.637 --> 00:24:12.660
you know, little more than
yes-men.

00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:15.971
So Micaiah answers the king's
question when he asks about the

00:24:15.971 --> 00:24:18.180
advisability of marching to the
north.

00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:20.059
And he says, "March and triumph!
 

00:24:20.059 --> 00:24:22.759
The Lord will deliver into Your
Majesty's hands."

00:24:22.759 --> 00:24:25.304
He's done what he's been told
to do: give the same answer as

00:24:25.304 --> 00:24:26.210
the other prophets.
 

00:24:26.210 --> 00:24:28.599
But he doesn't use the
prophetic formula.

00:24:28.599 --> 00:24:31.438
He doesn't say,
"Thus says the Lord" or some

00:24:31.438 --> 00:24:34.210
other indication that he's had a
vision,

00:24:34.210 --> 00:24:36.566
that he's prophesying,
that he's actually conveying

00:24:36.566 --> 00:24:37.650
the word of the Lord.
 

00:24:37.650 --> 00:24:40.840
And the king seems to sense
this and sense this deception,

00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:43.135
and he says,
"How many times must I adjure

00:24:43.135 --> 00:24:46.829
you to tell me nothing but the
truth in the name of the Lord?"

00:24:46.829 --> 00:24:50.811
So Micaiah lets the king have
it, and he tells of this vision

00:24:50.811 --> 00:24:54.831
that he received from God,
a vision of Israel scattered

00:24:54.831 --> 00:24:58.459
among, I'm sorry,
of Israel scattered over hills

00:24:58.459 --> 00:25:00.681
like sheep.
So he's seeing sheep,

00:25:00.681 --> 00:25:02.150
right, without a shepherd.
 

00:25:02.150 --> 00:25:04.407
The implication being that
Israel's shepherd,

00:25:04.407 --> 00:25:06.819
who is the king,
is going to be killed in battle

00:25:06.819 --> 00:25:09.138
and,
like the sheep spread on the

00:25:09.138 --> 00:25:11.319
hill, Israel will be scattered.
 

00:25:11.319 --> 00:25:15.069
So the king is very irritated
by Micaiah's prophecy.

00:25:15.069 --> 00:25:17.977
He says, "Didn't I tell
you…he would not prophesy good

00:25:17.977 --> 00:25:20.039
fortune for me,
but only misfortune?"

00:25:20.039 --> 00:25:23.487
What's interesting is,
in the section that follows,

00:25:23.487 --> 00:25:26.934
Micaiah gives an explanation
for why he is the lone

00:25:26.934 --> 00:25:29.564
dissenter.
He doesn't accuse the other

00:25:29.564 --> 00:25:31.660
prophets of being false
prophets.

00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:34.660
He represents them instead as
being misled,

00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:37.660
and as being misled by God,
if you will.

00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:42.050
So for the second time Micaiah
utters the word of the Lord.

00:25:42.050 --> 00:25:43.740
He has a second vision.
 

00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:47.791
And this vision is a vision of
God, who is seated on a throne

00:25:47.791 --> 00:25:51.099
and the host of heaven are
gathered around him.

00:25:51.099 --> 00:25:54.158
And God asks,
"Who will entice Ahab so that

00:25:54.158 --> 00:25:57.290
he will march and fall at
Ramoth-gilead?"

00:25:57.290 --> 00:26:00.624
And a certain one comes forward;
he volunteers for this task,

00:26:00.624 --> 00:26:02.559
and he tells how he's going to
do this.

00:26:02.559 --> 00:26:06.295
He says, "I will go out and be
a lying spirit in the mouth of

00:26:06.295 --> 00:26:07.539
all his prophets."
 

00:26:07.539 --> 00:26:09.328
And God says,
"You will entice,

00:26:09.328 --> 00:26:10.700
and you will prevail.
 

00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:12.500
Go out and do it."
 

00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:14.809
So Micaiah concludes this
vision by saying,

00:26:14.809 --> 00:26:18.109
"So the Lord has put a lying
spirit in the mouth of all these

00:26:18.109 --> 00:26:20.836
prophets of yours;
for the Lord has decreed

00:26:20.836 --> 00:26:22.100
disaster upon you."
 

00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:23.700
It's all part of God's plan.
 

00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:27.246
God is setting up Ahab for
disaster, presumably as

00:26:27.246 --> 00:26:31.313
punishment for his many sins,
just as he set up Pharaoh by

00:26:31.313 --> 00:26:33.854
hardening his heart,
so that he would be

00:26:33.854 --> 00:26:37.762
punished--hardening his heart
against Moses' pleas to let the

00:26:37.762 --> 00:26:40.775
Israelites go.
This is God's way of insuring

00:26:40.775 --> 00:26:43.470
their demise and insuring their
punishment.

00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:44.960
The king's a little upset.
 

00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:47.269
He doesn't know whom to believe.
 

00:26:47.269 --> 00:26:49.220
So he doesn't kill Micaiah on
the spot.

00:26:49.220 --> 00:26:51.880
He imprisons him;
he puts him on rations of bread

00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:55.205
and water, just to see what the
outcome of the battle will be

00:26:55.205 --> 00:26:57.450
first.
And Micaiah agrees to this.

00:26:57.450 --> 00:27:00.753
He says, "If you ever come home
safe, then the Lord has not

00:27:00.753 --> 00:27:01.950
spoken through me".
 

00:27:01.950 --> 00:27:04.990
His prophecy proves accurate,
of course.

00:27:04.990 --> 00:27:07.699
The king tries to disguise
himself so that no one will know

00:27:07.699 --> 00:27:10.456
that he is king and no one will
be able to target him in the

00:27:10.456 --> 00:27:12.390
battle.
So he disguises himself.

00:27:12.390 --> 00:27:15.420
Nevertheless,
he is killed in the battle and

00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:16.829
his army scatters.
 

00:27:16.829 --> 00:27:21.186
The story of Micaiah is
polemicizing against what the

00:27:21.186 --> 00:27:25.962
biblical writer perceived to be
the nationalization or the

00:27:25.962 --> 00:27:29.230
co-optation of the prophetic
guild.

00:27:29.230 --> 00:27:32.800
And in the process,
it paints a portrait of what

00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:35.079
the true prophet looks like.
 

00:27:35.079 --> 00:27:38.632
Micaiah is someone who is
determined to deliver God's

00:27:38.632 --> 00:27:42.594
word, even if it's opposed to
the wishes of the king or the

00:27:42.594 --> 00:27:46.009
view of the king and the view of
the majority.

00:27:46.009 --> 00:27:48.613
He's going to proclaim God's
judgment, and it will be a

00:27:48.613 --> 00:27:50.060
judgment against the nation.
 

00:27:50.060 --> 00:27:51.529
It will be a message of doom.
 

00:27:51.529 --> 00:27:55.153
And interestingly enough,
this will eventually become

00:27:55.153 --> 00:27:58.150
understood as the mark of a true
prophet.

00:27:58.150 --> 00:28:00.174
You know, the prophet of doom
is the one who's the true

00:28:00.174 --> 00:28:01.674
prophet.
As you can imagine,

00:28:01.674 --> 00:28:04.930
this kind of negativity didn't
sit well with established

00:28:04.930 --> 00:28:07.177
interests.
But at a later point in time

00:28:07.177 --> 00:28:09.446
looking back,
the tradition would single out

00:28:09.446 --> 00:28:12.560
some of these prophets as the
ones who had spoken truly.

00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:13.710
So that's one role.
 

00:28:13.710 --> 00:28:17.373
The true prophet stands up
against the prophetic guilds,

00:28:17.373 --> 00:28:20.369
the prophets who are employed
by the kings.

00:28:20.369 --> 00:28:25.232
A second role that we see
prophets playing in this section

00:28:25.232 --> 00:28:29.326
of historical narrative:
we see prophets as God's

00:28:29.326 --> 00:28:31.693
zealots.
And here again there's a

00:28:31.693 --> 00:28:34.549
contrast between true prophets
and false prophets.

00:28:34.549 --> 00:28:38.757
You find it particularly in
those zealous Yahwists,

00:28:38.757 --> 00:28:40.440
Elijah and Elisha.
 

00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:49.279
The Elijah stories are found in
1 Kings 17-19 and 21.

00:28:49.279 --> 00:28:53.803
The Elisha stories appear
towards the beginning of 2 Kings

00:28:53.803 --> 00:28:56.740
2-9 and a little bit in chapter
13.

00:28:56.740 --> 00:28:59.822
These materials are good
examples again of independent

00:28:59.822 --> 00:29:02.381
units of tradition,
popular stories that were

00:29:02.381 --> 00:29:05.290
incorporated into the
Deuteronomistic history.

00:29:05.290 --> 00:29:10.343
They are highly folkloristic;
they have lots of drama and

00:29:10.343 --> 00:29:14.213
color, plenty of miracles,
animals who behave in

00:29:14.213 --> 00:29:15.859
interesting ways.
 

00:29:15.859 --> 00:29:18.975
That this material began as a
set of folk stories is also

00:29:18.975 --> 00:29:22.147
suggested by the fact that
there's a great deal of overlap

00:29:22.147 --> 00:29:25.430
in the depiction of the
activities of the two prophets.

00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:28.369
So you have both of the
prophets multiplying food,

00:29:28.369 --> 00:29:31.130
both of them predict the death
of Ahab's queen,

00:29:31.130 --> 00:29:34.442
Queen Jezebel.
Both of them part water and so

00:29:34.442 --> 00:29:36.595
on.
But in their final form the

00:29:36.595 --> 00:29:40.787
stories have been interspersed
with historical footnotes about

00:29:40.787 --> 00:29:44.430
the two prophets and then set
into this framework,

00:29:44.430 --> 00:29:47.279
this larger framework,
of the history of the kings of

00:29:47.279 --> 00:29:48.539
the northern kingdom.
 

00:29:48.539 --> 00:29:51.797
So they've been appropriated by
the Deuteronomistic School,

00:29:51.797 --> 00:29:53.483
which, remember,
is a southern,

00:29:53.483 --> 00:29:55.730
Judean-based Deuteronomistic
School.

00:29:55.730 --> 00:29:58.900
They've been appropriated for
its purposes,

00:29:58.900 --> 00:30:02.674
which include a strong
condemnation of the northern

00:30:02.674 --> 00:30:06.599
kingdom, of Israel and her
kings, as idolatrous.

00:30:06.599 --> 00:30:09.750
So Elijah, Elijah the
Tishbite--which means that he

00:30:09.750 --> 00:30:12.460
comes from the city of Tishbeh
in Gilead,

00:30:12.460 --> 00:30:15.512
which is the other side of the
Jordan--Elijah is a very

00:30:15.512 --> 00:30:16.700
dramatic character.
 

00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:19.369
He comes across the Jordan.
 

00:30:19.369 --> 00:30:23.240
He's dressed in a garment of
hair and a leather girdle.

00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:26.344
At the end of his story he's
sort of whisked away,

00:30:26.344 --> 00:30:30.019
one of the king's servants
surmises, by the wind of God.

00:30:30.019 --> 00:30:33.950
He does battle with the cult of
Baal and Asherah.

00:30:33.950 --> 00:30:37.634
We associate Elijah most with
the battle with the cult of Baal

00:30:37.634 --> 00:30:40.202
and Asherah.
This had been introduced by

00:30:40.202 --> 00:30:43.135
King Ahab to please his
Baal-worshipping queen,

00:30:43.135 --> 00:30:46.568
Queen Jezebel.
And as his first act,

00:30:46.568 --> 00:30:49.700
Elijah announces a drought.
 

00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:52.289
He announces a drought in the
name of Yahweh.

00:30:52.289 --> 00:30:55.283
Now, this is a direct challenge
to Baal, because Baal is

00:30:55.283 --> 00:30:56.970
believed to control the rain.
 

00:30:56.970 --> 00:31:00.952
He's believed to control the
general fertility of the land

00:31:00.952 --> 00:31:03.783
and life itself.
So Elijah's purpose is

00:31:03.783 --> 00:31:07.360
presumably to show that it is
Yahweh, and not Baal,

00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:09.220
who controls fertility.
 

00:31:09.220 --> 00:31:12.029
We have very good evidence that
Baal was in fact worshipped in

00:31:12.029 --> 00:31:14.470
the northern Kingdom right down
to the destruction.

00:31:14.470 --> 00:31:17.069
This is something we've touched
on earlier as well.

00:31:17.069 --> 00:31:20.562
It's quite possible that
Israelites in the northern

00:31:20.562 --> 00:31:24.752
kingdom saw no real conflict
between the cult of Baal and the

00:31:24.752 --> 00:31:27.884
cult of Yahweh.
But in the Elijah story the

00:31:27.884 --> 00:31:31.493
Deuteronomistic historian
represents these two cults as

00:31:31.493 --> 00:31:33.900
being championed by
exclusivists.

00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:35.859
It's one or the other.
 

00:31:35.859 --> 00:31:40.062
Jezebel, Ahab's queen,
kept a retinue of 450 Baal

00:31:40.062 --> 00:31:44.789
prophets and was killing off the
prophets of Yahweh.

00:31:44.789 --> 00:31:47.722
And by the same token,
Elijah is equally zealous for

00:31:47.722 --> 00:31:49.824
Yahweh.
He refuses to tolerate the

00:31:49.824 --> 00:31:53.114
worship of any god but Yahweh,
and he performs miracles

00:31:53.114 --> 00:31:56.830
constantly in the name of Yahweh
to show that it is Yahweh and

00:31:56.830 --> 00:31:59.390
not Baal who gives life,
for example.

00:31:59.390 --> 00:32:03.334
He raises a dead child;
he multiplies oil and flour and

00:32:03.334 --> 00:32:06.885
so on, all of this in the name
of the Lord to show that it is

00:32:06.885 --> 00:32:09.430
Yahweh, and not Baal who has
true power.

00:32:09.430 --> 00:32:13.691
But as I've mentioned before,
there are some scholars who

00:32:13.691 --> 00:32:17.119
argue that biblical religion,
again as opposed to

00:32:17.119 --> 00:32:20.384
Israelite-Judean religion--what
actual people were doing in

00:32:20.384 --> 00:32:22.424
Israel and Judah,
that's one thing,

00:32:22.424 --> 00:32:25.273
but biblical religion,
which is this exclusive Yahwism

00:32:25.273 --> 00:32:28.123
or the tendency towards
monotheism--there are some who

00:32:28.123 --> 00:32:30.918
believe that that biblical
religion originated in the

00:32:30.918 --> 00:32:33.983
activity of zealous prophets
like Elijah and Elisha in the

00:32:33.983 --> 00:32:37.730
north,
doing battle with Baal worship.

00:32:37.730 --> 00:32:40.729
After the fall of the northern
kingdom, those traditions,

00:32:40.729 --> 00:32:43.881
those Yahweh-only traditions,
came south and were eventually

00:32:43.881 --> 00:32:45.869
absorbed in the Deuteronomistic
School.

00:32:45.869 --> 00:32:49.259
So this in fact may be the
origin of some:

00:32:49.259 --> 00:32:53.311
this Yahweh-only party
represented by figures like

00:32:53.311 --> 00:32:55.130
Elijah and Elisha.
 

00:32:55.130 --> 00:32:59.245
The conflict between the two
cults, the Yahweh cult and the

00:32:59.245 --> 00:33:03.289
Baal cult, reaches a climax in
the story in 1 Kings 18,

00:33:03.289 --> 00:33:07.884
this wonderful story in which
Elijah challenges the prophets

00:33:07.884 --> 00:33:10.609
of Baal and Asherah to a
contest.

00:33:10.609 --> 00:33:14.919
We have to remember that a
severe drought has fallen on the

00:33:14.919 --> 00:33:19.599
land, which Elijah attributes to
God's punishment for Ahab's sin

00:33:19.599 --> 00:33:23.240
in introducing Baal worship on a
broad scale.

00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:26.273
Now, Elijah is hiding from the
king, who's very angry with him

00:33:26.273 --> 00:33:28.660
for declaring this drought in
the name of God.

00:33:28.660 --> 00:33:31.410
After three years he returns to
Ahab.

00:33:31.410 --> 00:33:33.307
Ahab sees Elijah,
and he says,

00:33:33.307 --> 00:33:35.990
"Is that you,
you troubler of Israel?".

00:33:35.990 --> 00:33:38.907
And the prophet responds,
"It is not I who have brought

00:33:38.907 --> 00:33:41.229
trouble on Israel,
but you and your father's

00:33:41.229 --> 00:33:43.472
House,
by forsaking the commandments

00:33:43.472 --> 00:33:45.819
of the Lord and going after the
Baalim.

00:33:45.819 --> 00:33:48.937
Now summon all Israel to join
me at Mount Carmel together,

00:33:48.937 --> 00:33:52.219
with the four hundred and fifty
prophets of Baal and the four

00:33:52.219 --> 00:33:55.336
hundred prophets of Asherah,
who eat at Jezebel's table"

00:33:55.336 --> 00:33:57.309
that are supported by the royal
house.

00:33:57.309 --> 00:34:01.390
When all of these people are
gathered, Elijah challenges the

00:34:01.390 --> 00:34:04.018
Israelites.
He says, "'How long will you

00:34:04.018 --> 00:34:06.180
keep hopping between two
opinions?

00:34:06.180 --> 00:34:09.800
If the Lord is God, follow him;
and if Baal, follow him!'".

00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:11.400
You're hopping between two
opinions.

00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:13.699
So it seems that at the popular
level there is no problem with

00:34:13.699 --> 00:34:16.409
integrating these two cults,
but you have the prophets of

00:34:16.409 --> 00:34:19.060
both that are demanding a
certain exclusivity.

00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:20.590
He's met with silence.
 

00:34:20.590 --> 00:34:25.300
So Elijah prepares for a
dramatic contest.

00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:28.737
Two bulls are slaughtered,
and they are laid on altars,

00:34:28.737 --> 00:34:31.920
one an altar to Baal and one an
altar to Yahweh.

00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:36.217
And the 450 prophets of Baal
are to invoke their god and

00:34:36.217 --> 00:34:40.515
Elijah will invoke his God to
send a fire to consume the

00:34:40.515 --> 00:34:43.675
sacrifice.
The god who answers first,

00:34:43.675 --> 00:34:47.489
or the god who answers with
fire, is truly God.

00:34:47.489 --> 00:34:50.445
So the Baal prophets invoke
their god morning to noon,

00:34:50.445 --> 00:34:52.173
and they're shouting,
"Oh, Baal.

00:34:52.173 --> 00:34:54.396
Answer us."
And the description that

00:34:54.396 --> 00:34:56.360
follows is wonderfully
satirical.

00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:59.550
But there was no sound,
and none who responded;

00:34:59.550 --> 00:35:02.672
so they performed a hopping
dance about the altar that had

00:35:02.672 --> 00:35:04.425
been set up.
When noon came,

00:35:04.425 --> 00:35:07.250
Elijah mocked them,
saying, "Shout louder!

00:35:07.250 --> 00:35:08.309
After all he is a god.
 

00:35:08.309 --> 00:35:11.653
But he may be in conversation,
or he may be relieving himself

00:35:11.653 --> 00:35:14.106
[in the bathroom],
or he may be on a journey,

00:35:14.106 --> 00:35:16.670
or perhaps he is asleep and
will wake up."

00:35:16.670 --> 00:35:19.906
So they shouted louder,
and gashed themselves with

00:35:19.906 --> 00:35:22.944
knives and spears,
according to their practice,

00:35:22.944 --> 00:35:25.519
until the blood streamed over
them.

00:35:25.519 --> 00:35:27.448
When noon passed,
they kept raving until the hour

00:35:27.448 --> 00:35:28.733
of presenting the meal offering.
 

00:35:28.733 --> 00:35:30.300
[1 Kings 18:26-29;
see note 2]

00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:34.016
So more hours have gone by and
still there's no sound and none

00:35:34.016 --> 00:35:35.600
who responded or heeded.
 

00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:37.460
And then it's Elijah's turn.
 

00:35:37.460 --> 00:35:41.110
Elijah sets up 12 stones to
represent the 12 tribes;

00:35:41.110 --> 00:35:43.690
he lays the bull out on the
altar.

00:35:43.690 --> 00:35:46.384
He then digs a trench around
the altar and he orders water to

00:35:46.384 --> 00:35:48.764
be poured over the whole thing
so that it's completely

00:35:48.764 --> 00:35:51.010
saturated and the trench is
filled with water.

00:35:51.010 --> 00:35:53.840
This is going to highlight,
of course, the miracle that's

00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:56.486
about to occur.
And then he calls upon the name

00:35:56.486 --> 00:35:59.599
of the Lord, and instantly a
fire descends from God and

00:35:59.599 --> 00:36:01.617
consumes everything:
offering, wood,

00:36:01.617 --> 00:36:03.750
stone, earth,
water, everything.

00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:06.651
And the people prostrate
themselves and declare,

00:36:06.651 --> 00:36:07.948
"Yahweh alone is God.
 

00:36:07.948 --> 00:36:09.429
Yahweh alone is God."
 

00:36:09.429 --> 00:36:13.320
The prophets of Baal are all
seized and slaughtered.

00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:17.682
Elijah expects an end to the
drought, and a servant comes to

00:36:17.682 --> 00:36:22.192
report to him that "A cloud as
small as a man's hand is rising

00:36:22.192 --> 00:36:25.190
in the west,"
and the sky grows black and

00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:28.928
there's a strong wind and a
heavy storm, and the drought is

00:36:28.928 --> 00:36:31.443
finally over.
The language that's used to

00:36:31.443 --> 00:36:34.246
describe this storm is the
language that's typically

00:36:34.246 --> 00:36:36.170
employed for the storm god Baal.
 

00:36:36.170 --> 00:36:38.578
It drives home the point of the
whole satire,

00:36:38.578 --> 00:36:41.480
that Yahweh is the real god of
the storm, not Baal.

00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:43.910
Yahweh controls nature,
not Baal.

00:36:43.910 --> 00:36:47.456
It's God who is effective;
Baal is silent and powerless,

00:36:47.456 --> 00:36:49.849
and Israel's choice should be
clear.

00:36:49.849 --> 00:36:54.556
Yahweh should be the only God
for Israel, just as he is for

00:36:54.556 --> 00:36:59.099
Elijah, who's name El-i-yahu
means "my God is Yahweh."

00:36:59.099 --> 00:37:03.820
So Jezebel is pretty upset and
she threatens Elijah with

00:37:03.820 --> 00:37:06.629
execution.
He flees into the desert,

00:37:06.629 --> 00:37:10.827
and he will spend 40 days and
40 nights on a mountain called

00:37:10.827 --> 00:37:13.007
Horeb, or Sinai.
That, of course,

00:37:13.007 --> 00:37:15.179
is the site of God's revelation
to Moses.

00:37:15.179 --> 00:37:18.072
Moses also spent 40 days and 40
nights there,

00:37:18.072 --> 00:37:21.753
and many scholars have pointed
out the numerous parallels

00:37:21.753 --> 00:37:23.659
between Elijah and Moses.
 

00:37:23.659 --> 00:37:27.161
It seems that there was a
conscious literary shaping of

00:37:27.161 --> 00:37:29.950
the Elijah traditions on the
model of Moses,

00:37:29.950 --> 00:37:32.350
in more ways than just these
two.

00:37:32.350 --> 00:37:34.000
We'll see a few coming up.
 

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:37.070
Elijah is in great despair at
Sinai.

00:37:37.070 --> 00:37:40.896
He wants to die.
He feels that he has failed in

00:37:40.896 --> 00:37:42.510
his fight for God.
 

00:37:42.510 --> 00:37:45.888
And so he hides himself in a
rocky cleft, and this is also

00:37:45.888 --> 00:37:49.444
reminiscent of the cleft that
Moses hides himself in in order

00:37:49.444 --> 00:37:52.230
to catch a glimpse of God as God
passes by.

00:37:52.230 --> 00:37:57.206
Similarly, Elijah hides in a
cleft where he will encounter

00:37:57.206 --> 00:38:01.398
God.
This passage is in 1 Kings

00:38:01.398 --> 00:38:04.437
19:9-12:
Then the Word of the Lord

00:38:04.437 --> 00:38:05.890
came to him.
He said to him,

00:38:05.890 --> 00:38:07.329
"Why are you here,
Elijah?"

00:38:07.329 --> 00:38:09.866
He replied, "I am moved by zeal
for the Lord,

00:38:09.866 --> 00:38:12.173
the God of Hosts,
for the Israelites have

00:38:12.173 --> 00:38:14.867
forsaken Your covenant,
torn down Your altars,

00:38:14.867 --> 00:38:16.730
and put Your prophets to the
sword.

00:38:16.730 --> 00:38:19.908
I alone am left,
and they are out to take my

00:38:19.908 --> 00:38:21.665
life."
"Come out," He called,

00:38:21.665 --> 00:38:24.050
"and stand on the mountain
before the Lord."

00:38:24.050 --> 00:38:26.030
And lo, the Lord passed by.
 

00:38:26.030 --> 00:38:28.501
There was a great and mighty
wind, splitting mountains and

00:38:28.501 --> 00:38:30.409
shattering rocks by the power of
the Lord;

00:38:30.409 --> 00:38:32.260
but the Lord was not in the
wind.

00:38:32.260 --> 00:38:35.973
After the wind--an earthquake;
but the Lord was not in the

00:38:35.973 --> 00:38:38.389
earthquake.
After the earthquake--;fire;

00:38:38.389 --> 00:38:40.519
but the Lord was not in the
fire.

00:38:40.519 --> 00:38:43.150
And after the fire--a soft
murmuring sound.

00:38:43.150 --> 00:38:44.300
Or perhaps a still, small voice.
 

00:38:44.300 --> 00:38:48.570
A lot of translations use that
phrase, which is very poetic.

00:38:48.570 --> 00:38:51.770
When Elijah heard it,
he wrapped his mantle about his

00:38:51.770 --> 00:38:55.710
face and went out and stood at
the entrance of the cave.

00:38:55.710 --> 00:38:59.530
Elijah seems to be renewed
somehow at Sinai.

00:38:59.530 --> 00:39:02.910
This was the mountain that was
the source of Israel's covenant

00:39:02.910 --> 00:39:04.964
with God.
But whereas the earlier

00:39:04.964 --> 00:39:08.857
theophonies there at Sinai had
involved earthquake and wind and

00:39:08.857 --> 00:39:10.872
fire,
the narrative here seems to be

00:39:10.872 --> 00:39:13.949
making a point of saying that
God is not in the earthquake and

00:39:13.949 --> 00:39:15.210
the wind and the fire.
 

00:39:15.210 --> 00:39:17.460
He is in the lull after the
storm.

00:39:17.460 --> 00:39:21.356
This might then be providing a
kind of balance or corrective to

00:39:21.356 --> 00:39:24.813
the preceding story that we've
just had of Mount Carmel,

00:39:24.813 --> 00:39:26.510
Elijah on Mount Carmel.
 

00:39:26.510 --> 00:39:30.339
God may be the master of the
storm, and Elijah dramatically

00:39:30.339 --> 00:39:33.407
demonstrated that,
but he isn't to be identified

00:39:33.407 --> 00:39:36.179
with the storm in the same way
that Baal was.

00:39:36.179 --> 00:39:39.850
He's not a nature god,
and he's known only in silence.

00:39:39.850 --> 00:39:42.920
A kind of awesome vocal silence.
 

00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:45.594
In the theophony then that
follows to Elijah,

00:39:45.594 --> 00:39:47.600
God instructs Elijah to return.
 

00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:49.980
He has to leave Sinai;
he has to return to the people.

00:39:49.980 --> 00:39:52.631
He has work to do;
he has to foment rebellion,

00:39:52.631 --> 00:39:55.389
or revolution I should say,
in the royal house.

00:39:55.389 --> 00:39:57.840
This task is one that Elijah
will not complete.

00:39:57.840 --> 00:40:00.429
His disciple Elisha will end up
completing it.

00:40:00.429 --> 00:40:03.444
But the importance in this
scene I think is its emphasis on

00:40:03.444 --> 00:40:06.200
God as the God of history rather
than a nature god.

00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:10.058
Israel's God acts in history;
he's made known to humans by

00:40:10.058 --> 00:40:11.519
his acts in history.
 

00:40:11.519 --> 00:40:14.860
His prophet cannot withdraw to
a mountain retreat.

00:40:14.860 --> 00:40:19.638
He has to return and he has to
play his part in God's plans for

00:40:19.638 --> 00:40:22.932
the nation.
So we've discussed the prophet

00:40:22.932 --> 00:40:26.448
as God's zealot,
particularly as illustrated or

00:40:26.448 --> 00:40:29.199
exemplified by Elijah and
Elisha.

00:40:29.199 --> 00:40:32.903
The prophets also had other
roles, and we'll see this in

00:40:32.903 --> 00:40:35.469
Elisha.
Elisha succeeds Elijah.

00:40:35.469 --> 00:40:39.513
The cycle of stories about
Elijah ends with Elijah's ascent

00:40:39.513 --> 00:40:42.860
into Heaven on a fiery chariot
in a whirlwind.

00:40:42.860 --> 00:40:46.181
That's a detail in the story
that has contributed to the

00:40:46.181 --> 00:40:48.900
longstanding belief that Elijah
never died.

00:40:48.900 --> 00:40:51.949
And so Elijah will be the
harbinger of the Messiah.

00:40:51.949 --> 00:40:55.110
He will come back to announce
the coming of the Messiah.

00:40:55.110 --> 00:40:59.979
Elijah left his prophetic cloak
to his disciple and successor

00:40:59.979 --> 00:41:02.673
Elisha.
Elisha's involvement in the

00:41:02.673 --> 00:41:06.745
political arena was also
important and highlights another

00:41:06.745 --> 00:41:09.800
prophetic role we've touched on
before,

00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:12.420
that of kingmaker and
king-breaker.

00:41:12.420 --> 00:41:16.128
So just as Samuel anointed Saul
king and then David king in

00:41:16.128 --> 00:41:18.750
private meetings,
you also have Elisha.

00:41:18.750 --> 00:41:23.795
He sends an associate to
secretly anoint Jehu (Jehu is

00:41:23.795 --> 00:41:28.269
one of Ahab's ex-captains) as
king of Israel.

00:41:28.269 --> 00:41:31.570
This is going to initiate a
very bloody civil war.

00:41:31.570 --> 00:41:34.804
Jehu is going to massacre all
of Ahab's family,

00:41:34.804 --> 00:41:38.110
all of his supporters,
his retinue in Israel.

00:41:38.110 --> 00:41:42.089
He also assembles all of the
Baal worshippers in a great

00:41:42.089 --> 00:41:45.199
temple that was built by Ahab in
Samaria,

00:41:45.199 --> 00:41:47.710
and then he orders all of them
killed and the temple

00:41:47.710 --> 00:41:50.098
demolished.
So it is a pitched battle,

00:41:50.098 --> 00:41:53.594
an all-out war between the
Yahweh-only party the Baal

00:41:53.594 --> 00:41:56.171
party.
We're not going to be looking

00:41:56.171 --> 00:41:59.911
at Elisha in great detail,
but I will just point out one

00:41:59.911 --> 00:42:03.922
last aspect of his prophetic
profile that I think is notable

00:42:03.922 --> 00:42:06.030
here in the book of Kings.
 

00:42:06.030 --> 00:42:12.000
And that is the characteristic
of prophets as miracle workers.

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:14.430
Like Elijah,
Elisha performs miracles.

00:42:14.430 --> 00:42:18.920
He causes an iron axe to float;
he raises a child from the dead;

00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:20.990
he fills jars of oil.
 

00:42:20.990 --> 00:42:23.480
He makes poison soup edible.
 

00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:27.203
He causes 20 loaves of barley
to feed a hundred men,

00:42:27.203 --> 00:42:28.809
and he heals lepers.
 

00:42:28.809 --> 00:42:33.349
These legendary stories,
in which divine intentions are

00:42:33.349 --> 00:42:38.309
effected by means of the
supernatural powers of holy men,

00:42:38.309 --> 00:42:40.909
this represents a popular
religiosity.

00:42:40.909 --> 00:42:43.609
People would turn to
wonder-working holy men when

00:42:43.609 --> 00:42:46.590
they were sick or in crisis,
when they needed help.

00:42:46.590 --> 00:42:49.690
And this kind of religious
activity--which was clearly

00:42:49.690 --> 00:42:53.318
widespread in the Ancient Near
East and in Israel--this kind of

00:42:53.318 --> 00:42:55.665
popular belief,
this fascination with

00:42:55.665 --> 00:42:59.135
wonder-working charismatics,
it's also seen very prominently

00:42:59.135 --> 00:43:01.429
in the gospels of the New
Testament.

00:43:01.429 --> 00:43:07.076
A final prophetic role is very
well-illustrated by the prophet

00:43:07.076 --> 00:43:10.005
Nathan.
Nathan is the classic example

00:43:10.005 --> 00:43:13.980
of a prophet who serves as the
conscience of the king.

00:43:13.980 --> 00:43:18.264
In 2 Samuel:
11-12, we have the dramatic

00:43:18.264 --> 00:43:21.670
story of David and Bathsheba.
 

00:43:21.670 --> 00:43:24.919
King David's illicit union with
Bathsheba--as you know,

00:43:24.919 --> 00:43:28.650
she's the wife of Uriah who is
fighting in the king's army--his

00:43:28.650 --> 00:43:32.139
illicit union with Bathsheba
results in her pregnancy.

00:43:32.139 --> 00:43:35.494
And when David learns that
Bathsheba is pregnant,

00:43:35.494 --> 00:43:38.010
he first tries to avoid the
issue.

00:43:38.010 --> 00:43:42.269
He grants Uriah a leave from
the frontlines.

00:43:42.269 --> 00:43:46.059
He says: Come on home and have
a conjugal visit with your wife.

00:43:46.059 --> 00:43:48.977
And Uriah is very pious (and it
leaves you to wonder who knew

00:43:48.977 --> 00:43:50.679
what when).
It's a great story.

00:43:50.679 --> 00:43:52.710
It's told with a lot of
subtlety and indirection.

00:43:52.710 --> 00:43:54.614
But Uriah is very pious,
and he refuses:

00:43:54.614 --> 00:43:57.690
No, how could I enjoy myself
when people are out there dying?

00:43:57.690 --> 00:44:00.591
which is an implicit criticism
of the king, who just did that

00:44:00.591 --> 00:44:03.361
very thing.
And so David is foiled there,

00:44:03.361 --> 00:44:06.610
and he plans to then just
dispose of Uriah.

00:44:06.610 --> 00:44:09.315
So he orders Uriah's commanders
to place Uriah in the front

00:44:09.315 --> 00:44:11.834
lines of the battle and then
pull back so that Uriah is

00:44:11.834 --> 00:44:14.260
basically left on his own and he
will be killed.

00:44:14.260 --> 00:44:15.690
And indeed he is.
 

00:44:15.690 --> 00:44:18.670
So David adds murder to
adultery.

00:44:18.670 --> 00:44:22.480
But not even the king is above
God's law, and God sends his

00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:25.239
prophet Nathan to tell the king
a fable.

00:44:25.239 --> 00:44:29.539
This is in 2 Samuel 12:1
through 14.

00:44:29.539 --> 00:44:32.581
"There were two men in
the same city,

00:44:32.581 --> 00:44:34.320
one rich and one poor.
 

00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:37.074
And the rich man had very large
flocks and herds,

00:44:37.074 --> 00:44:40.288
but the poor man had only one
little ewe lamb that he had

00:44:40.288 --> 00:44:42.351
bought.
He tended it and it grew up

00:44:42.351 --> 00:44:45.266
together with him and his
children: it used to share his

00:44:45.266 --> 00:44:47.333
morsel of bread,
and drink from his cup,

00:44:47.333 --> 00:44:51.150
and nestle in his bosom;
it was like a daughter to him.

00:44:51.150 --> 00:44:53.964
One day, a traveler came to the
rich man, but he was loathe to

00:44:53.964 --> 00:44:56.456
take anything from his own
flocks or herds to prepare a

00:44:56.456 --> 00:44:58.440
meal for the guest who had come
to him;

00:44:58.440 --> 00:45:02.275
so he took the poor man's lamb
and prepared it for the man who

00:45:02.275 --> 00:45:03.469
had come to him."
 

00:45:03.469 --> 00:45:06.570
David flew into a rage against
the man and said to Nathan,

00:45:06.570 --> 00:45:09.181
"As the Lord lives,
the man who did this deserves

00:45:09.181 --> 00:45:11.253
to die!
He shall pay for the lamb four

00:45:11.253 --> 00:45:14.150
times over because he did such a
thing and showed no pity.

00:45:14.150 --> 00:45:18.119
And Nathan said to David,
"That man is you."

00:45:18.119 --> 00:45:21.936
It's such a wonderful story,
and it's wonderful to think

00:45:21.936 --> 00:45:25.059
that Nathan wasn't struck down
on the spot.

00:45:25.059 --> 00:45:27.800
He escaped with his life after
this accusation.

00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:31.097
But it's symptomatic of the
biblical narrator's view of

00:45:31.097 --> 00:45:34.150
monarchy, the subjugation of the
king to Yahweh,

00:45:34.150 --> 00:45:37.173
to Yahweh's teachings,
to Yahweh's commandments,

00:45:37.173 --> 00:45:40.905
to Yahweh's true prophets that
we don't hear that Nathan is

00:45:40.905 --> 00:45:44.639
carted off,
but instead David acknowledges

00:45:44.639 --> 00:45:47.039
his guilt and he repents.
 

00:45:47.039 --> 00:45:49.050
He doesn't escape all
punishment.

00:45:49.050 --> 00:45:52.367
For this deed the child of the
union does in fact die,

00:45:52.367 --> 00:45:55.934
and there's a great deal of
future strife and treachery in

00:45:55.934 --> 00:45:59.783
David's household as we know,
and the writer does blame a

00:45:59.783 --> 00:46:04.010
good deal of that on the deeds,
these terrible sins of David's.

00:46:04.010 --> 00:46:07.800
Elijah similarly is going to
function as the conscience of

00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:09.530
King Ahab in 1 Kings 21.
 

00:46:09.530 --> 00:46:11.639
There you have a story of a
vineyard.

00:46:11.639 --> 00:46:15.300
The king covets this particular
vineyard of a particular man.

00:46:15.300 --> 00:46:18.550
So the king's wife Jezebel
falsely accuses the man of

00:46:18.550 --> 00:46:21.001
blasphemy.
That is a capital crime and the

00:46:21.001 --> 00:46:23.856
man is stoned to death,
even though these are trumped

00:46:23.856 --> 00:46:27.150
up charges, and his property is
transferred to the crown.

00:46:27.150 --> 00:46:29.605
Shortly after that,
Elijah appears,

00:46:29.605 --> 00:46:33.578
and he pronounces doom upon
Ahab and his descendants for

00:46:33.578 --> 00:46:35.240
this terrible deed.
 

00:46:35.240 --> 00:46:36.810
Ahab admits the sin.
 

00:46:36.810 --> 00:46:39.428
He repents.
And so his punishment is

00:46:39.428 --> 00:46:42.965
delayed, but as we've seen he is
later killed in battle at

00:46:42.965 --> 00:46:45.950
Ramoth-Gilead.
So in these stories we see the

00:46:45.950 --> 00:46:49.360
prophets functioning as
troublers of Israel--certainly

00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:51.420
from the royal point of view.
 

00:46:51.420 --> 00:46:54.300
And their relationships with
the royal house--these

00:46:54.300 --> 00:46:56.489
relationships are quite
adversarial.

00:46:56.489 --> 00:46:59.871
So we're ready to move into
what we call the period of

00:46:59.871 --> 00:47:02.869
classical prophecy and the
literary prophets.

00:47:02.869 --> 00:47:05.824
And that's a period that begins
with two prophets,

00:47:05.824 --> 00:47:08.356
Amos and Hosea,
whom we'll be talking about

00:47:08.356 --> 00:47:10.701
next time.
The last prophet of the

00:47:10.701 --> 00:47:12.789
classical prophets was Malachi.
 

00:47:12.789 --> 00:47:15.690
So you have about a 320-year
period.

00:47:15.690 --> 00:47:19.269
You have the prophets
prophesying from about 750 down

00:47:19.269 --> 00:47:20.989
to about 430,320 years.
 

00:47:20.989 --> 00:47:25.293
That's the span of time covered
by these books of the literary

00:47:25.293 --> 00:47:27.267
prophets.
And these prophets were

00:47:27.267 --> 00:47:30.130
responding to urgent crises in
the life of the nation.

00:47:30.130 --> 00:47:33.387
It's easiest if we think of
them as being grouped around

00:47:33.387 --> 00:47:36.170
four periods of crisis or four
critical periods,

00:47:36.170 --> 00:47:37.769
which I've listed here.
 

00:47:37.769 --> 00:47:40.050
First we have prophets of the
Assyrian crisis.

00:47:40.050 --> 00:47:42.668
Right?
Remember the fall of Israel in

00:47:42.668 --> 00:47:45.900
722--so around that,
clustering around that time.

00:47:45.900 --> 00:47:47.980
We have prophets of the
Babylonian crisis,

00:47:47.980 --> 00:47:49.705
the destruction,
of course, is 586,

00:47:49.705 --> 00:47:52.140
so we have prophets who cluster
around that time,

00:47:52.140 --> 00:47:53.460
a little bit before.
 

00:47:53.460 --> 00:47:56.904
Then you have prophets of the
Exile, the years that are spent

00:47:56.904 --> 00:47:59.889
in exile in Babylon,
and that's primarily Ezekiel.

00:47:59.889 --> 00:48:03.487
And then we have prophets of
the post-exilic or restoration

00:48:03.487 --> 00:48:07.023
community, when the Israelites
are allowed to come back to

00:48:07.023 --> 00:48:08.760
restore their community.
 

00:48:08.760 --> 00:48:11.019
And we'll see certain prophets
there.

00:48:11.019 --> 00:48:14.340
So in the eighth century,
the Assyrian Empire is

00:48:14.340 --> 00:48:16.530
threatening Israel and Judah.
 

00:48:16.530 --> 00:48:19.699
You have two northern prophets,
Amos and Hosea.

00:48:19.699 --> 00:48:21.925
The N is for north,
so Amos and Hosea are

00:48:21.925 --> 00:48:24.819
prophesying in the north,
and they're warning of this

00:48:24.819 --> 00:48:26.390
doom.
It's going to come as

00:48:26.390 --> 00:48:28.940
punishment for violations of the
Mosaic Covenant.

00:48:28.940 --> 00:48:31.139
Israel fell in 722.
 

00:48:31.139 --> 00:48:34.021
You have a similar threat being
posed by the Assyrians to the

00:48:34.021 --> 00:48:35.269
southern kingdom,
Judah.

00:48:35.269 --> 00:48:39.019
And so you have two Judean
prophets, Isaiah and Micah.

00:48:39.019 --> 00:48:41.480
They carry a similar message to
the Judeans.

00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:44.469
So those four we associate with
the Assyrian crisis.

00:48:44.469 --> 00:48:47.837
With the fall of Nineveh the
capital of Assyria--that fall is

00:48:47.837 --> 00:48:51.429
in 612 and that's something that
the prophet Nahum celebrates;

00:48:51.429 --> 00:48:55.368
then Babylon is the master of
the region--Judah becomes a

00:48:55.368 --> 00:48:57.760
vassal state but tries to rebel.
 

00:48:57.760 --> 00:49:01.105
And the prophets Habakkuk and
Jeremiah, they prophesy in the

00:49:01.105 --> 00:49:02.750
southern kingdom,
in Judah.

00:49:02.750 --> 00:49:06.461
Jeremiah, he urges political
submission to Babylon because he

00:49:06.461 --> 00:49:09.739
sees Babylon as the agent of
God's just punishment.

00:49:09.739 --> 00:49:12.760
We'll come back and look at all
these messages in great detail.

00:49:12.760 --> 00:49:14.831
Post-exilic prophet,
or exilic prophet,

00:49:14.831 --> 00:49:17.338
Ezekiel as I said,
a prophet of the exile who's

00:49:17.338 --> 00:49:19.900
consoling the people in exile in
Babylonia,

00:49:19.900 --> 00:49:23.010
but also asserting the justice
of what has happened.

00:49:23.010 --> 00:49:26.093
And then finally at the end of
the sixth century when the first

00:49:26.093 --> 00:49:28.480
exiles are returning to restore
the community,

00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:31.159
returning to the homeland,
they face a very harsh life.

00:49:31.159 --> 00:49:34.258
And you have Haggai,
Zechariah promising a better

00:49:34.258 --> 00:49:36.629
future.
You have prophets like Joel and

00:49:36.629 --> 00:49:39.515
Malachi who bring some
eschatological hope into the

00:49:39.515 --> 00:49:41.017
mix.
So that can help frame--those

00:49:41.017 --> 00:49:42.719
are the ones we're going to
touch on mostly.

00:49:42.719 --> 00:49:44.713
We're not going to hit all of
the prophetic books,

00:49:44.713 --> 00:49:46.340
but these are the main ones
we'll hit.

00:49:46.340 --> 00:49:50.000
And we'll start with Amos next
time.

00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:02.213
Prof: Okay.
 

00:00:02.213 --> 00:00:03.380
Good morning,
ladies and gentlemen.

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:06.736
My name is Craig Wright and
this is "Listening to

00:00:06.736 --> 00:00:10.283
Music," the most basic
course that the Department of

00:00:10.283 --> 00:00:11.740
Music has to offer.
 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:14.660
Its aim is to teach you how to
listen to music.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.430
"Wait a minute,"
you say.

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:17.990
"That's preposterous.
 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:20.170
I listen to music all the time.
 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:23.593
I've got, what,
my iPod, I'm downloading mp3

00:00:23.593 --> 00:00:26.460
files, continually swapping
files.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.140
I've got my car..."
 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.750
(What do we call those things
in the automobile where you--

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.880
Is it a DAT tape that you can
take your iPod and plug it in to

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.141
the--
your--the stereo system in your

00:00:37.141 --> 00:00:37.510
car?)
 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:38.184
"I've got that.
 

00:00:38.184 --> 00:00:39.837
I listen to music in my dorm
room off my computer,

00:00:39.837 --> 00:00:40.850
in the bookstore,
wherever.

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.378
I bet I listen to a lot more
music than you do,

00:00:44.378 --> 00:00:45.990
you old goat."
 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:47.630
And you're right.
 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:49.140
You probably do.
 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.710
But what kind of music are you
listening to?

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.040
Well, probably pop music and
that's fine;

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.206
that's okay,
fair enough,

00:00:56.206 --> 00:00:56.790
pop music.
 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.551
But are you getting the most
out of this particular

00:01:00.551 --> 00:01:01.530
experience?
 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.450
Are you getting the most out of
your listening experience?

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.754
I contend that perhaps you are
not, that you are not maximizing

00:01:10.754 --> 00:01:13.810
the time, using that time most
profitably.

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.459
How do I know this?
 

00:01:16.459 --> 00:01:20.010
What makes me think that you
are not getting as much as you

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.030
possibly can out of your music?
 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.188
Well, experience,
to some degree,

00:01:24.188 --> 00:01:27.830
but also an experiment that I
did just last weekend.

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:29.040
I have four children.
 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.068
The last of the four has now
turned seventeen so I said last

00:01:33.068 --> 00:01:35.459
weekend--
he's always with the iPod

00:01:35.459 --> 00:01:37.700
on--"Chris,
what are you listening to?"

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.019
"Go away.
 

00:01:39.019 --> 00:01:40.500
You're bothering me." Okay.
 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.000
"You're ruining my life
again."

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.099
So &gt;
 

00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:44.867
"Well now,
come on.

00:01:44.867 --> 00:01:45.670
Let me listen to this.
 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:46.170
Let me listen to it.
 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.150
What are you listening to?"
 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:48.530
So I listened to it and I said,
"All right.

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.938
Here, you listen to this and
tell me what you're

00:01:50.938 --> 00:01:51.760
hearing."
 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.440
And what did--what was he
tracking?

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.242
He was tracking the text;
he was tracking the beat of the

00:01:57.242 --> 00:01:57.810
piece.
 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.831
I asked him,
"Well, what's the mode of

00:01:59.831 --> 00:02:00.409
the piece?
 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:02.700
What's the meter of the piece?
 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:03.790
What's the bass doing?
 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.250
Can you follow the bass line
there?

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.669
Can you identify any chords in
this particular piece?"

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:10.000
Nothing. Zero.
 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.715
And this from a reasonably
sophisticated kid who's had

00:02:13.715 --> 00:02:16.590
twelve years of serious cello
lessons,

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.685
and that brings up,
I suppose, a point:

00:02:19.685 --> 00:02:24.653
that although I don't know much
about your music I think I can

00:02:24.653 --> 00:02:28.807
teach you a great deal about
your music by using the

00:02:28.807 --> 00:02:31.658
paradigms of classical music.
 

00:02:31.658 --> 00:02:34.498
So I'm going to tell you a lot
about classical music in here:

00:02:34.498 --> 00:02:35.729
Mozart, Bach,
Beethoven.

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:38.889
It will be the locus of our
course.

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:41.780
How many of you already listen
to classical music?

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:42.580
Raise your hand.
 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:43.229
Okay. Great.
 

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:45.210
A lot of you and that's
wonderful.

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:47.310
I'd be interested to know,
gentleman down here,

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.270
how do you do this?
 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.690
Is it streaming off of your
computer?

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.009
Are you downloading mp3 files
and saving them?

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:55.720
How--Tell me. How do you do it?
 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.080
Student: I just go to
YouTube.

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.127
Prof: You go to YouTube.
 

00:02:58.127 --> 00:02:58.500
All right.
 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:59.520
Very interesting.
 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:00.900
I should have known that but I
didn't.

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.449
You go to YouTube and you
listen there.

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:05.875
Anybody else do it a different
way?

00:03:05.875 --> 00:03:06.479
Yes?
 

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:07.259
Student: On the radio.
 

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:08.719
Prof: On the radio. Okay.
 

00:03:08.719 --> 00:03:09.710
That's interesting.
 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:11.389
We'll come back to that point.
 

00:03:11.389 --> 00:03:12.688
Anything else, anybody?
 

00:03:12.688 --> 00:03:12.846
Yes?
 

00:03:12.846 --> 00:03:14.568
Student: My parents' CDs
or records.

00:03:14.568 --> 00:03:15.275
Prof: Okay.
 

00:03:15.275 --> 00:03:16.449
Your parents' CDs or records.
 

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:17.378
That's wonderful.
 

00:03:17.378 --> 00:03:21.186
They have sort of the old
technology here but some of

00:03:21.186 --> 00:03:24.699
those old recordings might be
very, very good.

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:26.318
Now here is a question for you.
 

00:03:26.318 --> 00:03:29.680
Why would we want to listen to
classical music?

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.525
Why do--why--who just answered
a question for me,

00:03:32.525 --> 00:03:34.599
those folks who raised your
hand?

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:36.318
What--gentleman here again.
 

00:03:36.318 --> 00:03:38.508
I'll--you're my sacrificial
lamb this morning.

00:03:38.508 --> 00:03:41.770
Why do you like to listen and
why would you want to listen to

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:42.750
classical music?
 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.169
Student: It relaxes me.
 

00:03:44.169 --> 00:03:45.229
Prof: Okay.
 

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:46.288
Very interesting.
 

00:03:46.288 --> 00:03:50.829
National Public Radio asked
exactly this question in a

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:55.882
survey a year or so ago and they
got the following principal

00:03:55.882 --> 00:03:57.508
responses back.
 

00:03:57.508 --> 00:03:58.870
Why do people listen to
classical music?

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.344
One, it helps them relax and
relieve stress,

00:04:02.344 --> 00:04:05.740
so this is perhaps the
principal reason.

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:09.969
Two, it helps us center the
mind, allowing the listener to

00:04:09.969 --> 00:04:11.008
concentrate.
 

00:04:11.008 --> 00:04:15.908
Three, classical music provides
a vision of a better world,

00:04:15.908 --> 00:04:21.278
a refuge of beauty,
of majesty, perhaps of even--

00:04:21.278 --> 00:04:24.569
of love--and sometimes,
at least for me personally,

00:04:24.569 --> 00:04:27.639
it suggests that there might be
something out there,

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:31.730
God or whatever,
bigger than ourselves,

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:36.240
and it asks us to think
sometimes, think about things.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.735
That's what I think these great
fine arts do,

00:04:39.735 --> 00:04:42.435
great literature,
poetry, painting,

00:04:42.435 --> 00:04:43.230
music.
 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:47.725
They show what human beings can
be, the capacity of the human

00:04:47.725 --> 00:04:48.399
spirit.
 

00:04:48.399 --> 00:04:51.858
They suggest to us as indicated
maybe there is something,

00:04:51.858 --> 00:04:55.502
a larger spirit out there than
ourselves, and they get us to

00:04:55.502 --> 00:04:56.120
think.
 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:59.466
They get me to think frequently
about what I'm doing on this

00:04:59.466 --> 00:04:59.920
earth.
 

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.459
What are you doing on this
earth?

00:05:02.459 --> 00:05:03.898
&gt;
 

00:05:03.898 --> 00:05:05.139
Don't answer that.
 

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:08.505
What am I doing on this earth
with regard to this particular

00:05:08.505 --> 00:05:09.019
course?
 

00:05:09.019 --> 00:05:12.199
What am I trying to accomplish
in here?

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:15.990
Well, maybe two things.
 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:21.269
One, change your personality.
 

00:05:21.269 --> 00:05:23.709
I want to make you a richer
person,

00:05:23.709 --> 00:05:28.127
a broader person,
by instilling you with an

00:05:28.127 --> 00:05:33.492
unending deep and abiding
understanding of classical

00:05:33.492 --> 00:05:35.978
music,
so that's part of this,

00:05:35.978 --> 00:05:39.269
and not just here for Yale but
for your life after Yale.

00:05:39.269 --> 00:05:44.129
I would hope that how you lead
your life ten years from now,

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:45.819
twenty years from now,
thirty years from now,

00:05:45.819 --> 00:05:49.831
would have been significantly
influenced by this particular

00:05:49.831 --> 00:05:51.769
experience in this course.
 

00:05:51.769 --> 00:05:54.557
And secondly,
if I'm successful in my

00:05:54.557 --> 00:05:58.430
teaching I will accomplish this
second aim here.

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:02.209
I will impart to you a love of
classical music.

00:06:02.209 --> 00:06:06.269
You, through,
later on after Yale,

00:06:06.269 --> 00:06:10.206
your attendance at concerts,
buying of one fashion or

00:06:10.206 --> 00:06:12.096
another,
downloading mp3 files,

00:06:12.096 --> 00:06:13.920
iTunes or whatever it happens
to be,

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:16.560
maybe being members of your
local symphony board,

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:17.970
opera company,
something like that,

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:20.649
maybe giving music lessons to
your children,

00:06:20.649 --> 00:06:25.550
you will become the purveyors
of classical music thereafter.

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:27.959
You, the intelligentsia of the
next generation,

00:06:27.959 --> 00:06:33.185
will be those that preserve
this great treasure of Western

00:06:33.185 --> 00:06:38.319
culture and it is a great
treasure of Western culture.

00:06:38.319 --> 00:06:38.524
Okay.
 

00:06:38.524 --> 00:06:40.000
How are we going to do all of
this?

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.675
How are we going to accomplish
these two things on our list of

00:06:43.675 --> 00:06:44.519
agenda here?
 

00:06:44.519 --> 00:06:46.920
What are the mechanics of the
course?

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:48.310
Did you all get a syllabus?
 

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:53.569
Everybody's got a syllabus?
 

00:06:53.569 --> 00:06:57.363
The first three or four weeks
or so we'll be following the

00:06:57.363 --> 00:07:00.625
elements of music:
rhythm, melody and harmony--and

00:07:00.625 --> 00:07:01.689
then a test.
 

00:07:01.689 --> 00:07:05.762
Next we will deal with what's
the--arguably--the single most

00:07:05.762 --> 00:07:09.903
important thing when we listen
to any piece of music and that

00:07:09.903 --> 00:07:11.560
is its musical form.
 

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:13.199
Here is a question for you.
 

00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:16.151
I was thinking about this the
other day as I was preparing the

00:07:16.151 --> 00:07:17.120
lecture for today.
 

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:21.569
What's the most common type of
musical form in pop music?

00:07:21.569 --> 00:07:26.642
When you listen to pop music do
you ever think about the form of

00:07:26.642 --> 00:07:27.610
the music?
 

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:33.690
Can anybody name a form of pop
music, any one form?

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:36.370
Well, maybe verse and chorus?
 

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:37.290
Think about that.
 

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:39.699
That shows up in a lot of stuff
and we'll come back to that.

00:07:39.699 --> 00:07:42.762
We'll talk about verse and
chorus when we get to the issue

00:07:42.762 --> 00:07:43.300
of form.
 

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:47.613
And then toward the end of the
course we will turn to the

00:07:47.613 --> 00:07:49.769
question of musical style.
 

00:07:49.769 --> 00:07:53.553
How does a piece of pop music
differ from a piece of classical

00:07:53.553 --> 00:07:54.050
music?
 

00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:57.305
We sort of all know this
intuitively but can we

00:07:57.305 --> 00:07:58.509
articulate why?
 

00:07:58.509 --> 00:08:01.754
This particular difference
about musical style was driven

00:08:01.754 --> 00:08:03.319
home to me the other day.
 

00:08:03.319 --> 00:08:04.399
It was last Friday.
 

00:08:04.399 --> 00:08:08.779
I was walking across the
campus--maybe you saw this too,

00:08:08.779 --> 00:08:11.009
corner of Elm and College.
 

00:08:11.009 --> 00:08:13.764
There was a large flatbed truck
out there and there were these

00:08:13.764 --> 00:08:15.389
people on this truck getting
you--

00:08:15.389 --> 00:08:17.540
trying to sell you audio
equipment,

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:20.528
and they had a big banner up
there.

00:08:20.528 --> 00:08:23.110
It said "Pump Up Your
Room."

00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:24.750
Okay?
 

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:28.379
So then to encourage you to
"pump up your room"

00:08:28.379 --> 00:08:32.335
they had music playing and this
is the kind of music that they

00:08:32.335 --> 00:08:34.279
had on that flatbed truck.
 

00:08:34.279 --> 00:08:37.559
 
 

00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:47.250
&gt;
 

00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:47.537
Okay.
 

00:08:47.537 --> 00:08:50.408
I'm feeling very pumped up at
that particular point

00:08:50.408 --> 00:08:51.960
&gt;
 

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:54.210
and my cell phone rings.
 

00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:56.538
Okay. My--This is true.
 

00:08:56.538 --> 00:09:01.116
My cell phone rings and because
one has the capacity nowadays to

00:09:01.116 --> 00:09:03.658
select your own ring
tone--right?

00:09:03.658 --> 00:09:07.825
I have mine selected not to
that sound but to Mozart,

00:09:07.825 --> 00:09:10.950
so I hear this sound on my
telephone.

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:14.259
 
 

00:09:14.259 --> 00:09:17.244
And it will give us a sense of
the difference in style between

00:09:17.244 --> 00:09:18.808
pop music and classical music.
 

00:09:18.808 --> 00:09:22.214
How does this,
what we're about to hear,

00:09:22.214 --> 00:09:23.000
differ?
 

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.691
Can you give me,
say, three or four reasons why

00:09:24.691 --> 00:09:26.860
what we're about to hear differs
from what we just heard?

00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:36.594
&gt;
 

00:09:36.594 --> 00:09:38.943
Mozart.
 

00:09:38.943 --> 00:09:49.350
&gt;
 

00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:50.210
Can anyone tell me?
 

00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:53.230
What's the difference between
these two?

00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:56.330
What's the--what did the pop
piece have?

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:57.870
That's Rave 'Til Dawn.
 

00:09:57.870 --> 00:09:59.524
That's my--I own that album,
I'll have you know,

00:09:59.524 --> 00:10:00.370
Rave 'Til Dawn.
 

00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:01.870
Gentleman back here.
 

00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:05.090
Student: In classical
music there's much more

00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:06.480
attention to detail.
 

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:09.154
Prof: Yes,
that's probably true as a

00:10:09.154 --> 00:10:11.635
general observation,
whether it comes through

00:10:11.635 --> 00:10:14.642
clearly on these two--
this comparison--I'm not quite

00:10:14.642 --> 00:10:16.830
so sure,
but there--I wouldn't say

00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:19.789
there's a great deal of detail
in the first one.

00:10:19.789 --> 00:10:21.090
There's a lot of repetition.
 

00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:24.517
That's where I--once that gets
going, it goes for a long period

00:10:24.517 --> 00:10:25.070
of time.
 

00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:26.169
Anything else?
 

00:10:26.169 --> 00:10:26.620
Yes?
 

00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:27.269
Student: A melody?
 

00:10:27.269 --> 00:10:28.294
Prof: Oh,
melody.

00:10:28.294 --> 00:10:29.500
Which one had the melody?
 

00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:30.528
Student: The classical
music.

00:10:30.528 --> 00:10:32.028
Prof: Yeah.
 

00:10:32.028 --> 00:10:33.860
&gt;
 

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:35.659
The first I couldn't pick out
any melody at all.

00:10:35.659 --> 00:10:39.230
It was all what?
 

00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:40.509
Rhythm and beat.
 

00:10:40.509 --> 00:10:41.460
Okay?
 

00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:43.462
So repetitious,
rhythm, beats,

00:10:43.462 --> 00:10:45.190
strong pulsation to it.
 

00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:47.009
What was making that sound?
 

00:10:47.009 --> 00:10:49.929
What were the instruments
playing in the--

00:10:49.929 --> 00:10:50.450
Student: Violins.
 

00:10:50.450 --> 00:10:53.320
Prof: Okay,
in the Mozart there were

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:56.530
violins, so acoustical
instruments as opposed to

00:10:56.530 --> 00:10:59.879
synthetic sound with regard to
the pop music.

00:10:59.879 --> 00:11:02.868
So what we will be doing is
differentiating pop from

00:11:02.868 --> 00:11:05.798
classical and also
differentiating within styles of

00:11:05.798 --> 00:11:06.970
classical music.
 

00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:09.600
You're driving down the road,
you ...

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:11.889
who is the FM listener?
 

00:11:11.889 --> 00:11:12.590
Over there ...
 

00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:15.595
You turn on your radio,
your car radio,

00:11:15.595 --> 00:11:19.470
to your FM classical music
station and what number

00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:22.159
approximately would you go to?
 

00:11:22.159 --> 00:11:25.149
Student: In New Haven?
 

00:11:25.149 --> 00:11:26.966
Prof: Yeah,
okay, or anywhere,

00:11:26.966 --> 00:11:28.379
your hometown,
but just--

00:11:28.379 --> 00:11:29.710
Student: All right. 98.7.
 

00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:31.200
Prof: Okay. 98.
 

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:32.490
That's pretty high.
 

00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:33.710
What town is that?
 

00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:34.010
Do you know?
 

00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:34.639
Student: Chicago.
 

00:11:34.639 --> 00:11:35.110
Prof: Oh, that's Chicago.
 

00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:38.470
Well, they're Elevated people
in Chicago I'm sure.

00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:39.700
&gt;
 

00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:42.928
Normally, where you go is all
the way down in the low numbers.

00:11:42.928 --> 00:11:46.397
Particularly,
here in Connecticut it's

00:11:46.397 --> 00:11:47.990
89.5,90.1,90.5.
 

00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:50.820
My favorite is 91.5 (WMRN).
 

00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:53.056
Generally speaking,
when you want to find classical

00:11:53.056 --> 00:11:55.740
music you go to the left of your
FM dial and fish around down

00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:57.529
there in your National Public
Radio.

00:11:57.529 --> 00:11:58.399
Okay?
 

00:11:58.399 --> 00:11:59.937
So that's how we do it,
but you got your car radio

00:11:59.937 --> 00:12:00.190
going.
 

00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:01.840
The music comes on.
 

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:03.529
Is it baroque or romantic?
 

00:12:03.529 --> 00:12:04.950
Is it medieval or modern?
 

00:12:04.950 --> 00:12:06.298
Is it Bach or is it Beethoven?
 

00:12:06.298 --> 00:12:09.480
Well, those sorts of answers,
those sorts of issues,

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:12.355
are the sorts of things that
we'll get to when we come to the

00:12:12.355 --> 00:12:15.090
question of musical style toward
the end of the course.

00:12:15.090 --> 00:12:15.889
Okay.
 

00:12:15.889 --> 00:12:17.139
Materials.
 

00:12:17.139 --> 00:12:18.580
Textbook.
 

00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:20.178
Here is the textbook.
 

00:12:20.178 --> 00:12:23.936
It is my own textbook,
Listening to Music,

00:12:23.936 --> 00:12:26.049
now in the fifth edition.
 

00:12:26.049 --> 00:12:29.000
I'm very proud of it.
 

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.158
Actually, it's used all across
the United States and used

00:12:32.158 --> 00:12:34.811
across the world,
about to come out in a Chinese

00:12:34.811 --> 00:12:36.559
edition for heaven's sakes.
 

00:12:36.559 --> 00:12:40.029
What was it?
 

00:12:40.029 --> 00:12:42.110
It was simply my lecture notes
from this particular course that

00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:43.519
I've been teaching here for a
long time.

00:12:43.519 --> 00:12:45.621
I had these lecture notes;
I had all of these listening

00:12:45.621 --> 00:12:47.429
exercises;
I basically just put it in a

00:12:47.429 --> 00:12:47.918
textbook.
 

00:12:47.918 --> 00:12:50.977
So this is all material for
Yale students,

00:12:50.977 --> 00:12:55.230
Yale--material designed here at
Yale for Yale students.

00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:58.426
At the back of the book--I
think I took mine out but at the

00:12:58.426 --> 00:13:01.567
back of the book you will see
wrapped with it an intro CD,

00:13:01.567 --> 00:13:02.668
introductory CD.
 

00:13:02.668 --> 00:13:05.475
You might be interested to know
that a lot of the material there

00:13:05.475 --> 00:13:07.389
actually recorded by Yale
undergraduates.

00:13:07.389 --> 00:13:08.668
We paid them for it.
 

00:13:08.668 --> 00:13:11.990
We paid people across the
street at the School of Music

00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:15.620
but this again is kind of native
local Yale produce here.

00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:19.363
So we have to--We get the
textbook and then with the

00:13:19.363 --> 00:13:23.620
textbook we recommend getting
access to this six-CD set.

00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:28.251
This material will be necessary
to do the listening exercises

00:13:28.251 --> 00:13:31.649
for the course,
which is sort of the backbone

00:13:31.649 --> 00:13:33.038
of the course.
 

00:13:33.038 --> 00:13:35.923
There are a couple of copies of
this on reserve in the music

00:13:35.923 --> 00:13:38.417
library and you can go over
there inside of Sterling

00:13:38.417 --> 00:13:41.399
Memorial Library and do the
listening there if you want,

00:13:41.399 --> 00:13:43.830
but one way or another you've
got to get a hold of this.

00:13:43.830 --> 00:13:47.676
If you decide to buy it,
it has one particular virtue

00:13:47.676 --> 00:13:52.115
and that is you end up with an
excellent library of classical

00:13:52.115 --> 00:13:55.370
music that will last you for a
lifetime.

00:13:55.370 --> 00:13:59.471
Years after the fact,
I get e-mail from--e-mails from

00:13:59.471 --> 00:14:00.340
students.
 

00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:03.629
Nowadays they usually begin,
"Hey, Professor"

00:14:03.629 --> 00:14:05.336
or "Yo,
Professor,"

00:14:05.336 --> 00:14:06.798
something like this.
 

00:14:06.798 --> 00:14:11.480
"I lost CD four to my
six-CD set.

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:13.330
Can you get me a
replacement?"

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:16.297
Yes, I can, and I do send them
a replacement,

00:14:16.297 --> 00:14:19.399
not too hard to do,
send them a replacement.

00:14:19.399 --> 00:14:22.547
So if you get the CD set,
not only do you get a wonderful

00:14:22.547 --> 00:14:25.864
beginning library of classical
music but in effect you get a

00:14:25.864 --> 00:14:28.000
lifetime service contract with
it.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.960
&gt;
 

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:32.409
Okay.
 

00:14:32.409 --> 00:14:33.308
Requirements.
 

00:14:33.308 --> 00:14:34.570
You can see this on the sheets
too.

00:14:34.570 --> 00:14:36.220
You've got a couple of tests
here.

00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:38.320
We have to write a short music
paper.

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:40.649
We're all going to go to a
concert.

00:14:40.649 --> 00:14:43.922
I think this year we're going
to go hear the Saybrook Youth

00:14:43.922 --> 00:14:44.600
Orchestra.
 

00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:48.322
And I put on the sheet this
year--I think I'm going to try

00:14:48.322 --> 00:14:51.460
to count five percent for class
participation.

00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:54.279
We will be taking attendance in
the lecture.

00:14:54.279 --> 00:14:55.620
Yeah, I know. It's babyish.
 

00:14:55.620 --> 00:14:58.220
I'm sorry, but I take this very
seriously.

00:14:58.220 --> 00:14:58.840
I really do.
 

00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:04.289
It's my lifeblood and I want
you to take this seriously too.

00:15:04.289 --> 00:15:05.808
I want you to come to class.
 

00:15:05.808 --> 00:15:09.399
I want you to come to lectures,
so we have the two lectures

00:15:09.399 --> 00:15:11.379
each week that you'll come to.
 

00:15:11.379 --> 00:15:14.129
Sections are also mandatory.
 

00:15:14.129 --> 00:15:18.129
We have three wonderful
specially selected TAs in here.

00:15:18.129 --> 00:15:20.080
I'll introduce you to them next
time.

00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:22.520
So come to two lectures,
one section,

00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:24.419
and do the work regularly.
 

00:15:24.419 --> 00:15:25.759
Now, sections.
 

00:15:25.759 --> 00:15:28.710
They start on Thursday and go
through a Monday cycle.

00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:30.500
They do not start tonight.
 

00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:32.759
They start next Thursday in the
cycle.

00:15:32.759 --> 00:15:36.073
You can go online and sign up
there but you're still shopping

00:15:36.073 --> 00:15:38.340
so we're not starting sections
tonight.

00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:41.450
You may not--may or may not be
taking this course.

00:15:41.450 --> 00:15:45.254
Do the assignments,
these listening exercises,

00:15:45.254 --> 00:15:46.100
on time.
 

00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:51.418
Music is an aurally perceived
phenomenon.

00:15:51.418 --> 00:15:56.288
You can't cram information
about music,

00:15:56.288 --> 00:15:59.606
the sound of music,
into your head the night before

00:15:59.606 --> 00:16:03.589
a test the way you might be able
to in an English course or a

00:16:03.589 --> 00:16:04.850
history course.
 

00:16:04.850 --> 00:16:09.505
The way we hear music,
the way our mind processes

00:16:09.505 --> 00:16:12.260
music,
is very, very different from

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:17.457
this other kind of information,
very different from history or

00:16:17.457 --> 00:16:18.548
economics.
 

00:16:18.548 --> 00:16:21.708
To make this point,
let me see if we can get my

00:16:21.708 --> 00:16:23.962
helper here,
technical person,

00:16:23.962 --> 00:16:28.614
to bring up a slide for me,
and my question to you is--as

00:16:28.614 --> 00:16:32.527
this slide comes up--
is the following:

00:16:32.527 --> 00:16:38.200
where in the brain is music
processed primarily?

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:41.168
Where do we process--Anybody
know the answer to that?

00:16:41.168 --> 00:16:44.489
Anybody who take psychology
courses, neurobiological

00:16:44.489 --> 00:16:45.139
courses?
 

00:16:45.139 --> 00:16:46.149
Yes, young lady out here.
 

00:16:46.149 --> 00:16:47.149
Do you have a sense of that?
 

00:16:47.149 --> 00:16:49.629
Student: I think it's
the left side--

00:16:49.629 --> 00:16:50.678
Prof: The left side of
the brain.

00:16:50.678 --> 00:16:53.163
That sounds like,
well, maybe the old creativity

00:16:53.163 --> 00:16:53.639
theory.
 

00:16:53.639 --> 00:16:55.740
Could we--And that's possible.
 

00:16:55.740 --> 00:16:59.100
In a way it's correct.
 

00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:02.100
Anything more specific?
 

00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:02.960
All right. Here's our brain.
 

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:04.650
We took this off of the
internet.

00:17:04.650 --> 00:17:05.450
All right?
 

00:17:05.450 --> 00:17:08.105
That's why it's all in French,
because it's not copyrighted,

00:17:08.105 --> 00:17:10.805
and we have to be careful with
that in here with these camera

00:17:10.805 --> 00:17:12.108
rolling--cameras rolling.
 

00:17:12.108 --> 00:17:16.376
So we have the tronc
cérébral down

00:17:16.376 --> 00:17:17.009
there.
 

00:17:17.009 --> 00:17:19.819
It just means the brainstem and
the cerebellum and then the

00:17:19.819 --> 00:17:21.323
temporal lobe,
the frontal lobe,

00:17:21.323 --> 00:17:23.308
the parietal and the occipital
lobes.

00:17:23.308 --> 00:17:25.730
Now where is music and language
processed?

00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:26.450
Anybody?
 

00:17:26.450 --> 00:17:27.868
And there is--Is somebody
raising their hand?

00:17:27.868 --> 00:17:31.320
Student: Well,
the temporal lobe is where your

00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:32.450
hearing occurs.
 

00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:35.059
Prof: Yes,
the temporal lobe is where your

00:17:35.059 --> 00:17:36.038
hearing goes on.
 

00:17:36.038 --> 00:17:38.440
It doesn't matter whether
you're hearing language or

00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:39.900
whether you're hearing music.
 

00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:45.082
This sort of processing happens
in the primary auditory cortex,

00:17:45.082 --> 00:17:48.759
both left and right,
of the temporal lobe.

00:17:48.759 --> 00:17:53.150
Let's say I had to remember to
play something at the keyboard.

00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:55.559
Well, there I might be
factoring in the frontal lobe

00:17:55.559 --> 00:17:58.395
because much of the short-term
memory in particular is in the

00:17:58.395 --> 00:17:59.200
frontal lobe.
 

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:05.630
Let's say I went to play a
piece &lt;&lt;music

00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:08.059
playing&gt;&gt;
 

00:18:08.059 --> 00:18:09.038
Now I didn't think about that.
 

00:18:09.038 --> 00:18:11.597
Actually, a minute ago I didn't
even know what I was going to

00:18:11.597 --> 00:18:12.750
play but I remember that.
 

00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:14.692
Am I thinking back there,
"Well, it starts in C and

00:18:14.692 --> 00:18:16.460
that's got an E up there and
it's got a G"?

00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:17.390
No.
 

00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:18.910
It's like athletes.
 

00:18:18.910 --> 00:18:22.009
It's muscle memory.
 

00:18:22.009 --> 00:18:23.996
You do that eight billion times
in your life and you can hit a

00:18:23.996 --> 00:18:24.808
good top spin backhand.
 

00:18:24.808 --> 00:18:28.483
It's muscle memory and that
happens in the--that's mostly in

00:18:28.483 --> 00:18:29.730
the parietal lobe.
 

00:18:29.730 --> 00:18:33.204
Here I've got to scroll up here
if I'm looking and then I've got

00:18:33.204 --> 00:18:34.750
the visual cortex engaged.
 

00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:36.400
So doing music,
if I'm sight reading,

00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:38.480
playing, it's a very complex
thing,

00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:45.083
but most of the--most of this
music and language processing

00:18:45.083 --> 00:18:50.083
happens in these--
the--as I mentioned--the left

00:18:50.083 --> 00:18:52.618
and right auditory cortex.
 

00:18:52.618 --> 00:18:55.490
Therefore--Where am I going
with all this?

00:18:55.490 --> 00:18:59.246
Therefore, the pedagogical
techniques that we use in

00:18:59.246 --> 00:19:03.075
teaching "Listening to
Music" are virtually

00:19:03.075 --> 00:19:07.200
identical to those that we use
in teaching language.

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:09.586
There is a great deal of
similarity here because it's

00:19:09.586 --> 00:19:10.690
just processing sound.
 

00:19:10.690 --> 00:19:13.537
This was a point--I was
listening to some National

00:19:13.537 --> 00:19:15.630
Public Radio thing the other
day--

00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:21.780
and listening to something that
had a psychologist talking about

00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:25.980
the correlation between sound
and music,

00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:27.108
and he said it was something
about--

00:19:27.108 --> 00:19:29.009
he said music is sometimes very
strange,

00:19:29.009 --> 00:19:33.160
sometimes very strange,
sometimes very strange,

00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:36.538
&gt;
 

00:19:36.538 --> 00:19:39.900
, and that sort of brought home
to me the text is irrelevant,

00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:43.259
the idea that music really is
sound and that language is just

00:19:43.259 --> 00:19:43.818
sound.
 

00:19:43.818 --> 00:19:47.215
There's a very thin line
between the two and we therefore

00:19:47.215 --> 00:19:50.976
use the same pedagogical methods
in the sense that we've got to

00:19:50.976 --> 00:19:52.250
do the following.
 

00:19:52.250 --> 00:19:55.608
If you ever read the course
descriptions of French 115 or

00:19:55.608 --> 00:19:57.823
Chinese language,
basic intro to Chinese,

00:19:57.823 --> 00:19:59.630
they say--I think I wrote it
down here,

00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:02.380
this process of gradual
assimilation.

00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:03.038
Yes.
 

00:20:03.038 --> 00:20:06.799
Daily participation in language
labs required.

00:20:06.799 --> 00:20:09.058
So daily is the key thing here.
 

00:20:09.058 --> 00:20:11.400
You've got to do this gradual
assimilation.

00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:14.182
So learning to listen to music
is just like listening to

00:20:14.182 --> 00:20:14.740
language.
 

00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:16.538
We've got to do a little bit
every day.

00:20:16.538 --> 00:20:19.930
You've got to turn in these
listening exercises in a regular

00:20:19.930 --> 00:20:21.539
fashion and come to class.
 

00:20:21.539 --> 00:20:22.980
This is a beginning course.
 

00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:26.183
I assume that you know nothing,
starting from ground zero here

00:20:26.183 --> 00:20:27.130
and build it up.
 

00:20:27.130 --> 00:20:27.986
All right.
 

00:20:27.986 --> 00:20:30.900
I've talked--I've droned on
here.

00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:34.273
Let me ask you if you have
questions about the course in

00:20:34.273 --> 00:20:37.710
general and do you have
questions of me at this point?

00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:40.799
 
 

00:20:40.799 --> 00:20:41.798
Yes, the gentleman in the back.
 

00:20:41.798 --> 00:20:44.058
Student: What are the
formats of the tests?

00:20:44.058 --> 00:20:47.558
Prof: The formats of the
tests will be very clearly laid

00:20:47.558 --> 00:20:48.348
out for you.
 

00:20:48.348 --> 00:20:49.750
There'll be a little bit of
written work.

00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:52.400
There'll be a fair amount of
listening.

00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:55.337
You will be given a list of
pieces that you'll have to

00:20:55.337 --> 00:20:58.554
prepare for a little bit and
then we will play out of those

00:20:58.554 --> 00:21:01.547
particular pieces,
but most importantly,

00:21:01.547 --> 00:21:04.000
I will give you a prep sheet.
 

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.403
Each test comes in advance with
a prep sheet telling you how to

00:21:06.403 --> 00:21:07.839
get ready for that particular
test.

00:21:07.839 --> 00:21:08.869
Good question though.
 

00:21:08.869 --> 00:21:09.740
Thank you.
 

00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:12.559
Anything else?
 

00:21:12.559 --> 00:21:13.098
Okay.
 

00:21:13.098 --> 00:21:15.450
If not, let's go on to the
following.

00:21:15.450 --> 00:21:17.671
We're going to have a
diagnostic quiz and you are

00:21:17.671 --> 00:21:19.058
taking a quiz the first day.
 

00:21:19.058 --> 00:21:22.078
Now that's on the back of your
handout there.

00:21:22.078 --> 00:21:24.396
This is not really a quiz
'cause we're not going to

00:21:24.396 --> 00:21:25.000
collect it.
 

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.130
You can throw it away going out.
 

00:21:28.130 --> 00:21:32.130
It's in here to--intended to do
two things: One,

00:21:32.130 --> 00:21:36.573
to show you something about the
method that we will be using in

00:21:36.573 --> 00:21:39.548
here and two,
to show you something of the

00:21:39.548 --> 00:21:42.410
level of this course--
the level of the course.

00:21:42.410 --> 00:21:48.460
The questions that I'm asking
on this quiz--

00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:51.473
the questions asked on the
quiz--are the types of things we

00:21:51.473 --> 00:21:54.230
would expect you to know at the
end of the course--

00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:56.660
not now, but at the end of the
course.

00:21:56.660 --> 00:21:58.019
Some of these are difficult.
 

00:21:58.019 --> 00:22:02.925
So if you find yourself getting
most of these answers correct,

00:22:02.925 --> 00:22:05.338
then don't take this course.
 

00:22:05.338 --> 00:22:07.538
You'd be wasting your time,
wasting your money here,

00:22:07.538 --> 00:22:10.708
so don't do this if you find at
the end of this you've got

00:22:10.708 --> 00:22:12.923
sixteen,
seventeen, eighteen of these

00:22:12.923 --> 00:22:13.440
correct.
 

00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:14.058
All right.
 

00:22:14.058 --> 00:22:18.105
Let's start with a little bit
of classical music here and this

00:22:18.105 --> 00:22:20.230
engages questions one and two.
 

00:22:20.230 --> 00:22:23.993
Who is the composer of the
piece that you're about to hear

00:22:23.993 --> 00:22:26.900
and what is its title or what's
it called?

00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:44.670
&gt;
 

00:22:44.670 --> 00:22:44.938
Okay.
 

00:22:44.938 --> 00:22:48.102
So let's--I'm going to ask them
to queue the next piece here

00:22:48.102 --> 00:22:50.568
while we talk about that just
for a moment.

00:22:50.568 --> 00:22:53.210
The composer--Anybody know the
composer of this?

00:22:53.210 --> 00:22:54.170
Raise your hand.
 

00:22:54.170 --> 00:22:54.839
Okay.
 

00:22:54.839 --> 00:22:56.049
Some people do.
 

00:22:56.049 --> 00:22:57.298
Some people don't.
 

00:22:57.298 --> 00:22:59.049
Gentleman over here,
in the dark shirt.

00:22:59.049 --> 00:23:00.118
Student: Beethoven?
 

00:23:00.118 --> 00:23:00.825
Prof: Okay.
 

00:23:00.825 --> 00:23:02.353
That is Beethoven,
Ludwig van Beethoven,

00:23:02.353 --> 00:23:03.960
and do you know the name of the
piece?

00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:05.118
Student: Fifth Symphony?
 

00:23:05.118 --> 00:23:05.967
Prof: Okay.
 

00:23:05.967 --> 00:23:06.530
Symphony no.
 

00:23:06.530 --> 00:23:06.720
5.
 

00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:08.566
Now if you're sitting next to
this gentleman--Oh,

00:23:08.566 --> 00:23:09.720
god, this guy knows so much.
 

00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:12.098
I'm going to go down the tube
in this course.

00:23:12.098 --> 00:23:12.249
No.
 

00:23:12.249 --> 00:23:13.740
Don't be intimidated by this.
 

00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:17.500
As I say, we're going to build
everybody up here together.

00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:20.586
So that was Beethoven's Fifth
Symphony, the beginning of it,

00:23:20.586 --> 00:23:23.358
a famous passage in the history
of classical music.

00:23:23.358 --> 00:23:26.480
Let's listen to another
composition here.

00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:30.578
Who is the composer of this and
what--in what composition is

00:23:30.578 --> 00:23:31.829
this piece used?
 

00:23:31.829 --> 00:24:05.240
&gt;
 

00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:06.490
So who is the composer of that?
 

00:24:06.490 --> 00:24:07.859
Does anybody know the answer?
 

00:24:07.859 --> 00:24:10.650
Fewer people do.
 

00:24:10.650 --> 00:24:13.453
Young lady out here in the
green, did you have your hand

00:24:13.453 --> 00:24:13.710
up?
 

00:24:13.710 --> 00:24:14.630
Student: Beethoven.
 

00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:15.548
Prof: Again Beethoven.
 

00:24:15.548 --> 00:24:19.116
What's--what's the--in what
composition does Beethoven use

00:24:19.116 --> 00:24:20.619
this particular piece?
 

00:24:20.619 --> 00:24:21.630
Does anybody know?
 

00:24:21.630 --> 00:24:22.549
Gentleman here?
 

00:24:22.549 --> 00:24:23.420
Student: Ninth Symphony.
 

00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:23.910
Prof: Okay.
 

00:24:23.910 --> 00:24:25.891
In the Ninth Symphony again and
you're saying,

00:24:25.891 --> 00:24:28.049
"Oh, I'm getting really
worried now."

00:24:28.049 --> 00:24:30.640
Don't be worried here.
 

00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:32.358
Okay. So Ninth Symphony.
 

00:24:32.358 --> 00:24:37.396
Now I believe that music works
a magical potion,

00:24:37.396 --> 00:24:39.970
a magical spell on us.
 

00:24:39.970 --> 00:24:43.680
Music gets us to do particular
kinds of things,

00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:47.390
gets us to feel particular
kinds of ways,

00:24:47.390 --> 00:24:50.759
and I think these two pieces by
the same composer get--

00:24:50.759 --> 00:24:55.150
cause--us to feel very,
very different,

00:24:55.150 --> 00:24:57.397
cause a different mood,
a different psychological

00:24:57.397 --> 00:24:59.170
state,
to come over us.

00:24:59.170 --> 00:25:08.000
One of them goes this way:
&gt;

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.880
Okay? And the other.
 

00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:17.450
&gt;
 

00:25:17.450 --> 00:25:22.652
I want to do a little
experiment, have never done this

00:25:22.652 --> 00:25:28.638
before but I'd like to do the
following and that is to ask you

00:25:28.638 --> 00:25:35.019
to think about what mood each
piece causes you to fall into,

00:25:35.019 --> 00:25:37.980
and I've put some adjectives up
on the board up there and I've

00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:40.700
grouped them by Rs and Ls
because I'm going to ask you to

00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:43.516
raise your right hand if you
respond one way to a piece and

00:25:43.516 --> 00:25:45.750
your left hand if you respond
the other.

00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:48.338
So under the R group there
we've got positive,

00:25:48.338 --> 00:25:49.259
happy, secure.
 

00:25:49.259 --> 00:25:52.583
Under the L group we've got
negative, anxious,

00:25:52.583 --> 00:25:53.470
unsettled.
 

00:25:53.470 --> 00:25:57.193
So I've chosen pieces maybe
with slightly different feels

00:25:57.193 --> 00:25:57.660
here.
 

00:25:57.660 --> 00:25:59.650
Let's see what we do with this.
 

00:25:59.650 --> 00:26:07.589
Now piece number one:
&gt;

00:26:07.589 --> 00:26:09.118
How do you feel about that?
 

00:26:09.118 --> 00:26:14.818
Now here's piece two:
&gt;

00:26:14.818 --> 00:26:15.352
All right.
 

00:26:15.352 --> 00:26:17.799
So here's one if--I'm going to
play it again.

00:26:17.799 --> 00:26:23.328
&gt;
 

00:26:23.328 --> 00:26:27.224
If you raise your right hand or
left hand as your response to

00:26:27.224 --> 00:26:27.680
that.
 

00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:30.848
Okay.
 

00:26:30.848 --> 00:26:38.470
Here's piece one:
&gt;

00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:39.529
Right hand or left hand.
 

00:26:39.529 --> 00:26:41.118
All right.
 

00:26:41.118 --> 00:26:43.750
So those of you that are
raising your hand,

00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:49.048
and some aren't raising their
hands but that's okay,

00:26:49.048 --> 00:26:52.530
those of you almost unanimously
say that the Beethoven Fifth

00:26:52.530 --> 00:26:55.009
Symphony sounds somewhat ominous
to us,

00:26:55.009 --> 00:26:57.046
somewhat fateful to us,
and the Beethoven Ninth

00:26:57.046 --> 00:26:59.568
Symphony conversely has a
different sort of feel to it.

00:26:59.568 --> 00:27:02.578
Indeed, does anybody know the
title of the Beethoven Ninth

00:27:02.578 --> 00:27:03.160
Symphony?
 

00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:06.078
It was the setting of a poem by
Friedrich Schiller called--

00:27:06.078 --> 00:27:07.170
Student: Ode to
Joy?

00:27:07.170 --> 00:27:08.519
Prof: Ode to Joy.
 

00:27:08.519 --> 00:27:12.547
So how does Beethoven go
about making the Ode to Joy

00:27:12.547 --> 00:27:13.450
joyful?
 

00:27:13.450 --> 00:27:16.118
What does he do here?
 

00:27:16.118 --> 00:27:18.068
This is what we're going to be
doing in our course.

00:27:18.068 --> 00:27:19.848
We're going to be zeroing in on
this music.

00:27:19.848 --> 00:27:23.191
Can anybody tell me why to a
person in this room we all

00:27:23.191 --> 00:27:26.842
responded positively to the
Ninth Symphony and somewhat more

00:27:26.842 --> 00:27:29.069
anxiously to the Fifth Symphony?
 

00:27:29.069 --> 00:27:31.670
You have to tell me one thing.
 

00:27:31.670 --> 00:27:32.640
Student: Major and minor?
 

00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:33.971
Prof: Okay.
 

00:27:33.971 --> 00:27:35.230
Major and minor.
 

00:27:35.230 --> 00:27:40.038
Now once again you--you're out
here in front.

00:27:40.038 --> 00:27:42.892
You've been listening to your
parents' records and CDs and so

00:27:42.892 --> 00:27:45.710
maybe--
I'm delighted that you know

00:27:45.710 --> 00:27:51.109
this, but maybe this is too far
below your dignity here so--

00:27:51.109 --> 00:27:52.180
but good for you.
 

00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:52.676
All right.
 

00:27:52.676 --> 00:27:54.368
So: &lt;&lt;music
playing&gt;&gt;

00:27:54.368 --> 00:27:58.025
we've got this idea of major
chords and minor chords so let

00:27:58.025 --> 00:27:59.160
me ask you this.
 

00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:02.097
Which--I think this is a quiz
question here,

00:28:02.097 --> 00:28:03.670
probably number five.
 

00:28:03.670 --> 00:28:04.598
Which is this?
 

00:28:04.598 --> 00:28:11.690
A major chord or a minor chord
&gt;

00:28:11.690 --> 00:28:12.589
as opposed to?
 

00:28:12.589 --> 00:28:17.910
&gt;
 

00:28:17.910 --> 00:28:20.089
The first one is a minor chord.
 

00:28:20.089 --> 00:28:23.710
The second one is a major chord.
 

00:28:23.710 --> 00:28:26.309
We can call them triads and
we'll be talking about what that

00:28:26.309 --> 00:28:28.690
is before--so that's one reason:
major versus minor.

00:28:28.690 --> 00:28:29.940
Here's a question for you.
 

00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:31.240
What about this?
 

00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:32.950
&gt;
 

00:28:32.950 --> 00:28:34.200
Let me take the rhythm out of
it.

00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:37.210
&gt;
 

00:28:37.210 --> 00:28:39.000
That's a bit skippy, isn't it?
 

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:42.048
Doesn't that move around a lot?
 

00:28:42.048 --> 00:28:47.361
Whereas the--if I take the
rhythm out of the Ninth Symphony

00:28:47.361 --> 00:28:50.200
&gt;
 

00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:53.693
really Beethoven there is just
going up and down a scale so

00:28:53.693 --> 00:28:54.960
it's very conjunct.
 

00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:58.404
We have the difference between
conjunct music with the

00:28:58.404 --> 00:29:00.420
&gt;
 

00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:04.278
and disjunct music
&gt;

00:29:04.278 --> 00:29:07.484
and that perhaps adds to the
unsettled quality of the

00:29:07.484 --> 00:29:09.150
Beethoven Fifth Symphony.
 

00:29:09.150 --> 00:29:13.435
Here's something else and I
guess it's a quiz question I

00:29:13.435 --> 00:29:17.799
think I'm asking you there,
and it has to do about a home

00:29:17.799 --> 00:29:18.578
pitch.
 

00:29:18.578 --> 00:29:25.557
Music gravitates around a home
pitch and in the Beethoven Fifth

00:29:25.557 --> 00:29:30.058
Symphony &lt;&lt;music
playing&gt;&gt;

00:29:30.058 --> 00:29:31.308
we still haven't gotten the
home pitch.

00:29:31.308 --> 00:29:33.220
We go that far and we still
haven't heard the home pitch.

00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:35.038
Can anybody sing the home pitch?
 

00:29:35.038 --> 00:29:36.816
&gt;
 

00:29:36.816 --> 00:29:39.480
&gt;
 

00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:43.665
But he hasn't given it to us
and maybe that's why this sounds

00:29:43.665 --> 00:29:48.808
so disjunct and so unsettled,
apart from the skippy nature of

00:29:48.808 --> 00:29:51.589
the melody,
is that we are not given at the

00:29:51.589 --> 00:29:54.410
outset the home pitch whereas
with the Ninth Symphony,

00:29:54.410 --> 00:29:59.338
&gt;
 

00:29:59.338 --> 00:30:01.463
second phrase,
that's the home pitch there and

00:30:01.463 --> 00:30:03.730
we all feel sort of secure in
that home pitch.

00:30:03.730 --> 00:30:06.951
There's another reason I think
these two sound differently and

00:30:06.951 --> 00:30:08.220
that is the following.
 

00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:11.910
What's the direction generally
of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony?

00:30:11.910 --> 00:30:16.490
&gt;
 

00:30:16.490 --> 00:30:17.759
Student: Down.
 

00:30:17.759 --> 00:30:18.220
Prof: Down.
 

00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:18.910
It's generally going down.
 

00:30:18.910 --> 00:30:22.635
So the direction that music
goes can also affect how we feel

00:30:22.635 --> 00:30:26.362
about it, our mood about it,
so I think the next question--I

00:30:26.362 --> 00:30:28.318
play another piece for you.
 

00:30:28.318 --> 00:30:31.535
I want to play this one with
the piano a little bit and I ask

00:30:31.535 --> 00:30:34.000
you the name of the composer of
this piece--

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.200
it's a bit less well known but
maybe not--

00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:41.439
what it's called and when in
the history of music it was

00:30:41.439 --> 00:30:42.210
written.
 

00:30:42.210 --> 00:31:00.960
&gt;
 

00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:04.380
Anybody know that piece and the
name of the composer?

00:31:04.380 --> 00:31:04.661
Yeah?
 

00:31:04.661 --> 00:31:06.799
Student:
*

00:31:06.799 --> 00:31:07.848
Prof: Okay.
 

00:31:07.848 --> 00:31:11.124
Debussy, a French composer
writing at the end of the

00:31:11.124 --> 00:31:14.269
nineteenth century in the
Impressionist style,

00:31:14.269 --> 00:31:16.380
and the piece is called
Moonlight--

00:31:16.380 --> 00:31:19.917
Clair de Lune--but again
you may- you'll come out of this

00:31:19.917 --> 00:31:21.612
course--
four months from now you'll

00:31:21.612 --> 00:31:22.618
know all of this stuff.
 

00:31:22.618 --> 00:31:25.808
Now you're not supposed to know
any of this.

00:31:25.808 --> 00:31:29.390
What I'm interested in is your
emotional response to this.

00:31:29.390 --> 00:31:31.460
How do you feel about this
music?

00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:33.819
What kind of mood does it put
you in?

00:31:33.819 --> 00:32:09.450
&gt;
 

00:32:09.450 --> 00:32:10.750
Now how do you feel about that?
 

00:32:10.750 --> 00:32:14.190
Anybody want to tell me about
that?

00:32:14.190 --> 00:32:14.476
Student: --serene..
 

00:32:14.476 --> 00:32:14.838
Prof: I beg your
pardon.

00:32:14.838 --> 00:32:19.279
Oops, I heard--Nice and loud
please.

00:32:19.279 --> 00:32:20.390
Student: Serene?
 

00:32:20.390 --> 00:32:21.329
Prof: Serene.
 

00:32:21.329 --> 00:32:21.859
Yeah, serene.
 

00:32:21.859 --> 00:32:24.578
Why does it feel serene?
 

00:32:24.578 --> 00:32:27.960
Boy, I wish I could play my
Rave 'Til Dawn CD now.

00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:28.538
Right?
 

00:32:28.538 --> 00:32:34.920
&lt;&lt;simulates playing
music&gt;&gt;

00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:36.460
Okay. There's no beat to it.
 

00:32:36.460 --> 00:32:37.338
All right.
 

00:32:37.338 --> 00:32:40.490
It's very languid in terms of
the pulse here.

00:32:40.490 --> 00:32:44.259
It's very understated in terms
of a beat.

00:32:44.259 --> 00:32:48.787
You'd be hard pressed to
identify what the meter of that

00:32:48.787 --> 00:32:53.029
is so that's one reason,
and of course what--where am I

00:32:53.029 --> 00:32:57.067
going with the next important
point about what's happening in

00:32:57.067 --> 00:32:58.009
this music?
 

00:32:58.009 --> 00:33:06.477
It makes us feel serene,
relaxed, because it's all going

00:33:06.477 --> 00:33:12.019
down &lt;&lt;music
playing&gt;&gt;

00:33:12.019 --> 00:33:21.450
and only when we get here
&gt;

00:33:21.450 --> 00:33:24.720
do our spirits soar upward at
that particular point.

00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:29.037
So again, direction in music
also is important with how we

00:33:29.037 --> 00:33:30.250
respond to it.
 

00:33:30.250 --> 00:33:31.789
So what are we going over here?
 

00:33:31.789 --> 00:33:32.829
Major versus minor?
 

00:33:32.829 --> 00:33:35.980
Disjunct versus conjunct?
 

00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:36.890
What else?
 

00:33:36.890 --> 00:33:41.058
Strongly felt tonal key,
which is called--

00:33:41.058 --> 00:33:42.730
I don't know if I mentioned
this or not--

00:33:42.730 --> 00:33:44.692
the tonic key,
the tonic pitch,

00:33:44.692 --> 00:33:48.367
the tonic pitch there,
and this idea of the direction

00:33:48.367 --> 00:33:49.318
of the music.
 

00:33:49.318 --> 00:33:53.887
All of these we'll have to be
thinking about as we listen to

00:33:53.887 --> 00:33:55.670
music in this course.
 

00:33:55.670 --> 00:34:02.430
Okay. Now let's see.
 

00:34:02.430 --> 00:34:08.380
I think I want to do the
following.

00:34:08.380 --> 00:34:09.659
Yeah.
 

00:34:09.659 --> 00:34:10.989
Here's a question for you.
 

00:34:10.989 --> 00:34:14.472
Here's a question,
a completely different subject

00:34:14.472 --> 00:34:14.980
here.
 

00:34:14.980 --> 00:34:17.969
What are the two dimensions of
music?

00:34:17.969 --> 00:34:21.514
Think about dimensions of
painting or architecture perhaps

00:34:21.514 --> 00:34:24.190
but what are the two dimensions
of music?

00:34:24.190 --> 00:34:25.969
Have you thought about that?
 

00:34:25.969 --> 00:34:28.760
Can anybody give me one?
 

00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:31.860
Well, pitch--Oh, yeah.
 

00:34:31.860 --> 00:34:33.349
I'm sorry. Okay.
 

00:34:33.349 --> 00:34:34.010
Pitch.
 

00:34:34.010 --> 00:34:36.159
And what would the other one be?
 

00:34:36.159 --> 00:34:37.050
Time.
 

00:34:37.050 --> 00:34:41.010
Okay, pitch and time and pitch
and duration,

00:34:41.010 --> 00:34:42.670
excellent, so those are the two
dimensions of music and well,

00:34:42.670 --> 00:34:45.813
indeed we could even call them
the axes of music because we

00:34:45.813 --> 00:34:48.199
tend to think of pitch on a
vertical axis.

00:34:48.199 --> 00:34:50.715
We talk in terms of high pitch
and low pitch although we'll

00:34:50.715 --> 00:34:53.422
fine tune that next time,
and then we have this idea of

00:34:53.422 --> 00:34:57.061
duration or time,
which we tend to write out in

00:34:57.061 --> 00:35:01.010
symbols that move from your left
to right.

00:35:01.010 --> 00:35:04.413
So what I'd like to do now is
focus on a piece that

00:35:04.413 --> 00:35:07.409
emphasizes--foregrounds--just
the first axis,

00:35:07.409 --> 00:35:08.090
pitch.
 

00:35:08.090 --> 00:35:11.030
Here is a question for you.
 

00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:17.782
How many of you have heard
Richard Strauss's Also Sprach

00:35:17.782 --> 00:35:19.880
Zarathustra?
 

00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:21.480
Okay.
 

00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:24.666
How many--and be courageous
here--how many have not heard

00:35:24.666 --> 00:35:27.570
Richard Strauss's Also Sprach
Zarathustra?

00:35:27.570 --> 00:35:28.960
Raise your hand nice and big.
 

00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:32.699
Okay, the overwhelming majority
of people say they have not.

00:35:32.699 --> 00:35:33.800
Wrong.
 

00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:35.980
You all have heard this many
times.

00:35:35.980 --> 00:35:39.340
It's used continuously as a
movie score, television,

00:35:39.340 --> 00:35:40.659
radio commercials.
 

00:35:40.659 --> 00:35:42.378
It's all over the place,
and as soon as I start to play

00:35:42.378 --> 00:35:44.452
it,
at least once we get in to it,

00:35:44.452 --> 00:35:45.659
you'll say,
"Oh, yeah,

00:35:45.659 --> 00:35:46.260
I've heard that."
 

00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:51.664
So this is a piece by Strauss
where he's trying to resurrect

00:35:51.664 --> 00:35:53.882
the content,
or mirror the content,

00:35:53.882 --> 00:35:55.800
of a philosophical novel by
Friedrich Nietzsche,

00:35:55.800 --> 00:36:00.266
Thus Spoke Zarathustra,
and it's about the unleashing

00:36:00.266 --> 00:36:04.807
of human capacity as it comes
forth from the primordial earth

00:36:04.807 --> 00:36:05.489
here.
 

00:36:05.489 --> 00:36:09.673
And in Strauss in attempting to
do this will use the orchestra

00:36:09.673 --> 00:36:13.378
to depict here in this
particular case perhaps the rise

00:36:13.378 --> 00:36:16.302
of human power,
maybe as metaphorically

00:36:16.302 --> 00:36:20.681
represented by the sun,
so here is Strauss depicting

00:36:20.681 --> 00:36:22.699
the rise of the sun.
 

00:36:22.699 --> 00:36:27.257
And the first question I think
that you have on the quiz here

00:36:27.257 --> 00:36:30.597
is the following:
what keyboard instrument is

00:36:30.597 --> 00:36:31.889
playing here?
 

00:36:31.889 --> 00:36:33.268
It's a keyboard instrument.
 

00:36:33.268 --> 00:36:35.500
So let's listen to just a
little bit of this please right

00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:35.739
now.
 

00:36:35.739 --> 00:36:44.739
 
 

00:36:44.739 --> 00:36:51.880
&gt;
 

00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:54.666
What that is,
is an organ pipe of the type of

00:36:54.666 --> 00:36:57.389
organ that we have over in
Woolsey Hall,

00:36:57.389 --> 00:37:01.768
thirty-two feet tall,
this gigantic sound of

00:37:01.768 --> 00:37:04.010
&gt;
 

00:37:04.010 --> 00:37:06.070
down there so that's what he's
trying to set up.

00:37:06.070 --> 00:37:07.280
Okay?
 

00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:11.422
Then a brass instrument enters
and what is the name of this

00:37:11.422 --> 00:37:12.780
brass instrument?
 

00:37:12.780 --> 00:37:35.710
&gt;
 

00:37:35.710 --> 00:37:37.289
And a percussion instrument.
 

00:37:37.289 --> 00:37:54.090
&gt;
 

00:37:54.090 --> 00:37:59.570
So the brass instrument is
the--is a--trumpet.

00:37:59.570 --> 00:38:00.219
Okay?
 

00:38:00.219 --> 00:38:01.099
That's what that is.
 

00:38:01.099 --> 00:38:02.070
It's coming up there.
 

00:38:02.070 --> 00:38:04.170
Let's talk about what we've
done on the board here.

00:38:04.170 --> 00:38:10.360
We can see we have these low
pitches, &gt;

00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:11.340
What did I just sing?
 

00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:13.340
&gt;
 

00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:14.914
Almost the same sounding pitch.
 

00:38:14.914 --> 00:38:15.269
Right?
 

00:38:15.269 --> 00:38:16.079
Well, we'll talk about this.
 

00:38:16.079 --> 00:38:17.500
This is called an octave.
 

00:38:17.500 --> 00:38:18.719
&gt;
 

00:38:18.719 --> 00:38:21.639
It has to do with frequency
ratios that we'll go in to a

00:38:21.639 --> 00:38:22.860
little bit next time.
 

00:38:22.860 --> 00:38:25.730
So he's coming up initially
just through octaves.

00:38:25.730 --> 00:38:27.579
&gt;
 

00:38:27.579 --> 00:38:30.139
Then the next pitch on the
trumpet &gt;

00:38:30.139 --> 00:38:32.969
is actually an interval of a
fifth.

00:38:32.969 --> 00:38:34.440
&gt;
 

00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:35.929
That's a fourth
&gt;

00:38:35.929 --> 00:38:38.010
but it happens to produce an
octave &gt;

00:38:38.010 --> 00:38:39.639
against that.
 

00:38:39.639 --> 00:38:41.949
Then the first time
&gt;

00:38:41.949 --> 00:38:45.927
so he came up a major third
there and then quickly backed

00:38:45.927 --> 00:38:50.260
off with just a half step below
it, which completely gave it a

00:38:50.260 --> 00:38:51.610
different feel.
 

00:38:51.610 --> 00:38:54.208
So a bright,
shiny major and then dark

00:38:54.208 --> 00:38:54.769
minor.
 

00:38:54.769 --> 00:38:57.440
&gt;
 

00:38:57.440 --> 00:38:59.769
Then a percussion instrument
came in.

00:38:59.769 --> 00:39:03.710
Anybody know what that was?
 

00:39:03.710 --> 00:39:05.639
Okay.
 

00:39:05.639 --> 00:39:07.420
Tell me what it was.
 

00:39:07.420 --> 00:39:08.322
Nice and loud.
 

00:39:08.322 --> 00:39:09.550
Yell it out there.
 

00:39:09.550 --> 00:39:10.070
Student: Timpani?
 

00:39:10.070 --> 00:39:12.010
Prof: Timpani or as it's
sometimes called a kettle drum,

00:39:12.010 --> 00:39:14.820
and it was playing two
different pitches,

00:39:14.820 --> 00:39:17.150
actually sort of playing this
pitch and this pitch,

00:39:17.150 --> 00:39:20.159
the octave and then the fifth.
 

00:39:20.159 --> 00:39:25.188
The fifth degree of the scale
after the tonic is the next most

00:39:25.188 --> 00:39:28.980
important and it's called the
dominant note.

00:39:28.980 --> 00:39:29.750
Okay?
 

00:39:29.750 --> 00:39:32.230
So that's what that is in that
particular question.

00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:38.920
So the timpani comes in and it
goes crazy &gt;

00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:42.255
and comes back to the tonic at
which point the trumpet takes

00:39:42.255 --> 00:39:42.989
over again.
 

00:39:42.989 --> 00:39:45.469
So let's listen to just a
little bit more and I

00:39:45.469 --> 00:39:46.980
think--Well, let's listen.
 

00:39:46.980 --> 00:39:48.699
I forget where we left off.
 

00:39:48.699 --> 00:40:02.010
&gt;
 

00:40:02.010 --> 00:40:05.755
Now at this point what happens
is the trumpet

00:40:05.755 --> 00:40:07.630
&gt;
 

00:40:07.630 --> 00:40:08.409
all the way up there.
 

00:40:08.409 --> 00:40:09.519
It's going to jump way, way up.
 

00:40:09.519 --> 00:40:13.090
So let's listen to that.
 

00:40:13.090 --> 00:40:34.280
&gt;
 

00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:36.559
What's happening and interests
me acoustically,

00:40:36.559 --> 00:40:38.925
and again we'll come back to
it, is that we're getting up

00:40:38.925 --> 00:40:40.940
toward here,
and notice how these pitches in

00:40:40.940 --> 00:40:43.789
terms of the ratio frequencies
are getting very close together.

00:40:43.789 --> 00:40:47.949
So we're going to go
&gt;

00:40:47.949 --> 00:40:49.190
You sing the next note.
 

00:40:49.190 --> 00:40:51.980
&gt;
 

00:40:51.980 --> 00:40:52.860
There it is up there.
 

00:40:52.860 --> 00:40:53.469
Okay? Good.
 

00:40:53.469 --> 00:40:54.329
You got it. Come on. Louder.
 

00:40:54.329 --> 00:40:55.849
&gt;
 

00:40:55.849 --> 00:40:57.150
Coraggio!
 

00:40:57.150 --> 00:40:58.150
Okay. So there we are there.
 

00:40:58.150 --> 00:41:00.579
My question on the quiz is
what's this one called?

00:41:00.579 --> 00:41:05.920
&gt;
 

00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:06.233
Okay.
 

00:41:06.233 --> 00:41:09.989
So this is a leading tone going
in to that particular note.

00:41:09.989 --> 00:41:24.911
So let's listen to here again
just the very end of this with

00:41:24.911 --> 00:41:38.063
the spectacular sound of the
orchestra, &lt;&lt;music

00:41:38.063 --> 00:41:42.869
playing&gt;&gt;
 

00:41:42.869 --> 00:41:45.884
and there at the end you could
hear the organ a little bit

00:41:45.884 --> 00:41:46.360
better.
 

00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:51.398
So that's how using some of
these basic ratios gives us this

00:41:51.398 --> 00:41:56.010
primordial type of music and
it's quite spectacular.

00:41:56.010 --> 00:41:59.393
It's quite spectacular because
here in the 1890s we have the

00:41:59.393 --> 00:42:02.202
apex of the Western classical
orchestra, this big,

00:42:02.202 --> 00:42:04.210
beautiful, powerful instrument.
 

00:42:04.210 --> 00:42:04.753
Okay.
 

00:42:04.753 --> 00:42:09.550
We've talked a little bit about
pitch here.

00:42:09.550 --> 00:42:15.815
Let's go on to talk about the
other axis of music and that is

00:42:15.815 --> 00:42:18.010
rhythm or duration.
 

00:42:18.010 --> 00:42:22.773
Now in music as you probably
know--we've already talked a

00:42:22.773 --> 00:42:27.880
little bit about this--we have
the importance of the beat.

00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:31.726
The beat's very important in
music and generally speaking,

00:42:31.726 --> 00:42:33.820
in music, we divide the beat.
 

00:42:33.820 --> 00:42:35.530
We organize it into groups.
 

00:42:35.530 --> 00:42:37.210
The beat's kind of like the
heartbeat.

00:42:37.210 --> 00:42:42.989
It's kind of like the basic
pulse of &gt;

00:42:42.989 --> 00:42:47.010
but, given our psychological
makeup,

00:42:47.010 --> 00:42:49.585
we tend to divide these up into
units: so generally two and

00:42:49.585 --> 00:42:52.846
generally three,
and if we have groups of two we

00:42:52.846 --> 00:42:56.117
call that duple meter;
groups of three we call that of

00:42:56.117 --> 00:42:57.119
course triple meter.
 

00:42:57.119 --> 00:42:58.510
How do we indicate these?
 

00:42:58.510 --> 00:43:00.679
Well, by some kind of
conducting pattern.

00:43:00.679 --> 00:43:01.429
We'll come back to this.
 

00:43:01.429 --> 00:43:02.820
You'll all be conducting in
here.

00:43:02.820 --> 00:43:08.637
So duple is just one,
two, one two,

00:43:08.637 --> 00:43:14.969
one two, one,
&gt;

00:43:14.969 --> 00:43:17.034
, one strong beat,
one weak beat,

00:43:17.034 --> 00:43:18.467
strong,
weak, strong,

00:43:18.467 --> 00:43:22.420
weak, in that fashion,
and conversely of course triple

00:43:22.420 --> 00:43:24.717
is strong,
weak, weak, strong,

00:43:24.717 --> 00:43:28.769
weak, weak, with two weak beats
between each strong beat.

00:43:28.769 --> 00:43:31.530
So here's a question for you.
 

00:43:31.530 --> 00:43:34.402
Who wrote the musical,
and it's on your quiz there,

00:43:34.402 --> 00:43:35.380
Chicago?
 

00:43:35.380 --> 00:43:36.750
Anybody know the answer to that?
 

00:43:36.750 --> 00:43:37.523
How--Okay.
 

00:43:37.523 --> 00:43:42.170
How many don't know--a rousing
show of hands here--don't know

00:43:42.170 --> 00:43:44.340
who wrote Chicago?
 

00:43:44.340 --> 00:43:45.679
This is amazing to me.
 

00:43:45.679 --> 00:43:48.230
This guy is the stealth bomber
of music.

00:43:48.230 --> 00:43:51.416
How nobody could know the name
of this person that has given us

00:43:51.416 --> 00:43:53.307
so much great music,
Cabaret,

00:43:53.307 --> 00:43:55.530
Chicago,
songs that you go on singing,

00:43:55.530 --> 00:43:58.380
have in your ear all the time,
John Kander,

00:43:58.380 --> 00:44:01.300
lives down in New York City,
writes a lot of this stuff.

00:44:01.300 --> 00:44:06.052
So we're going to listen to a
track out of John Kander's

00:44:06.052 --> 00:44:09.903
Chicago here,
and the question that's at--in

00:44:09.903 --> 00:44:13.260
play at the moment is what's the
meter of this cut from

00:44:13.260 --> 00:44:14.380
Chicago?
 

00:44:14.380 --> 00:44:25.070
&gt;
 

00:44:25.070 --> 00:44:25.465
Okay.
 

00:44:25.465 --> 00:44:28.630
Here's something that may
interest you.

00:44:28.630 --> 00:44:31.570
We'll be playing a lot of pop
music in here but they will

00:44:31.570 --> 00:44:33.670
generally be short clips of pop
music.

00:44:33.670 --> 00:44:38.849
Why is that the case?
 

00:44:38.849 --> 00:44:42.369
For copyright reasons,
that's right.

00:44:42.369 --> 00:44:44.210
So we've heard a passage here.
 

00:44:44.210 --> 00:44:48.030
What was the meter of that
section?

00:44:48.030 --> 00:44:50.215
Gentleman down here,
you seem to be moving with the

00:44:50.215 --> 00:44:51.440
music, which is very good.
 

00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:52.152
What did you think?
 

00:44:52.152 --> 00:44:52.789
Duple or triple?
 

00:44:52.789 --> 00:44:53.849
Student: Duple.
 

00:44:53.849 --> 00:44:55.557
Prof: Okay,
duple.

00:44:55.557 --> 00:44:58.050
Now I would come--That's
correct.

00:44:58.050 --> 00:45:00.811
I would come right back to you
with yeah, you intuited that but

00:45:00.811 --> 00:45:02.860
can you explain to me what you
were hearing?

00:45:02.860 --> 00:45:07.126
What did you hear that allowed
your brain to instantly go to

00:45:07.126 --> 00:45:10.309
that decision,
make that correct decision?

00:45:10.309 --> 00:45:11.639
Any ideas?
 

00:45:11.639 --> 00:45:12.869
Anybody.
 

00:45:12.869 --> 00:45:15.230
Student: Cut time--
Prof: Okay, cut time.

00:45:15.230 --> 00:45:16.007
Student: Accent on one..
 

00:45:16.007 --> 00:45:16.510
Prof: What?
 

00:45:16.510 --> 00:45:19.054
Accent on one,
but what part of the music were

00:45:19.054 --> 00:45:20.130
you listening to?
 

00:45:20.130 --> 00:45:23.829
Student:
&gt;

00:45:23.829 --> 00:45:24.478
Prof: Yeah.
 

00:45:24.478 --> 00:45:25.090
Yeah, that's it.
 

00:45:25.090 --> 00:45:27.570
Somebody's up there going
&gt;

00:45:27.570 --> 00:45:29.992
and it's actually the bass so
we'll be wanting to zero in on

00:45:29.992 --> 00:45:32.170
the bass in a big way in music
&gt;

00:45:32.170 --> 00:45:34.909
because that's oftentimes
giving us much more information

00:45:34.909 --> 00:45:35.789
than the melody.
 

00:45:35.789 --> 00:45:37.210
&gt;
 

00:45:37.210 --> 00:45:39.170
So there we had an example of
duple.

00:45:39.170 --> 00:45:39.860
Let's see.
 

00:45:39.860 --> 00:45:41.260
Have we got another excerpt
here?

00:45:41.260 --> 00:45:43.150
Let's listen to a little bit of
that.

00:45:43.150 --> 00:45:54.130
&gt;
 

00:45:54.130 --> 00:45:56.000
So what about that one?
 

00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:57.230
Student: Triple.
 

00:45:57.230 --> 00:45:57.585
Prof: Yeah.
 

00:45:57.585 --> 00:45:58.079
You know the setup here.
 

00:45:58.079 --> 00:45:59.590
We did duple and now we've got
to do triple.

00:45:59.590 --> 00:46:00.306
Okay.
 

00:46:00.306 --> 00:46:07.050
So that's strong,
weak, weak, in that fashion.

00:46:07.050 --> 00:46:07.679
All right?
 

00:46:07.679 --> 00:46:09.599
Now let's listen to a little
bit more of this,

00:46:09.599 --> 00:46:11.650
and something interesting
happens to the beat.

00:46:11.650 --> 00:46:13.030
It slows down.
 

00:46:13.030 --> 00:46:17.552
What do we call the passage of
music in which the beat slows

00:46:17.552 --> 00:46:18.090
down?
 

00:46:18.090 --> 00:46:19.150
What's being applied?
 

00:46:19.150 --> 00:46:20.489
What's being affected here?
 

00:46:20.489 --> 00:46:22.500
What's being used here?
 

00:46:22.500 --> 00:46:31.809
&gt;
 

00:46:31.809 --> 00:46:34.960
Okay, a very simple word there:
Ritard.

00:46:34.960 --> 00:46:38.010
Okay? So the music is retarded.
 

00:46:38.010 --> 00:46:42.289
We have the pulse being slowed
down and almost like a law of

00:46:42.289 --> 00:46:46.317
physics or something,
now comes a reaction--now John

00:46:46.317 --> 00:46:50.052
Kander makes the music
accelerate so let's watch a

00:46:50.052 --> 00:46:53.179
wonderful example of accelerando
here.

00:46:53.179 --> 00:47:00.313
&gt;
 

00:47:00.313 --> 00:47:04.250
Let me hear it.
 

00:47:04.250 --> 00:47:05.239
Okay.
 

00:47:05.239 --> 00:47:09.637
So at that point the music
begins to speed up with the

00:47:09.637 --> 00:47:10.800
accelerando.
 

00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:11.920
Now &lt;&lt;music
playing&gt;&gt;

00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:14.760
getting close
&gt;

00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:16.190
drive to the end.
 

00:47:16.190 --> 00:47:17.699
Do you ever notice this in
musical compositions?

00:47:17.699 --> 00:47:19.909
Keep an eye out for this,
particularly in pop music.

00:47:19.909 --> 00:47:22.760
They've got an idea but they've
got to fill up a track.

00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:27.010
They really need a good three
minutes and thirty seconds here.

00:47:27.010 --> 00:47:30.067
They'll have something going
and then almost unbeknownst to

00:47:30.067 --> 00:47:33.177
you they will take that and lift
it up in terms of the pitch

00:47:33.177 --> 00:47:33.809
content.
 

00:47:33.809 --> 00:47:38.213
What is that called when you
change the fundamental pitch in

00:47:38.213 --> 00:47:41.500
a piece, going to a different
pitch level?

00:47:41.500 --> 00:47:43.190
Anybody know about that?
 

00:47:43.190 --> 00:47:46.326
Called modulation and this is
sort of where we'll be really,

00:47:46.326 --> 00:47:48.559
really four months from now,
modulation.

00:47:48.559 --> 00:47:50.619
It's very subtle.
 

00:47:50.619 --> 00:47:54.541
A lot of what we were doing
today is very straightforward,

00:47:54.541 --> 00:47:58.737
the idea of duple versus triple
meter, but most modulations we

00:47:58.737 --> 00:48:00.320
don't usually hear.
 

00:48:00.320 --> 00:48:04.643
So let's listen to--We've got
two more cuts to do and then

00:48:04.643 --> 00:48:06.010
I'll let you go.
 

00:48:06.010 --> 00:48:08.693
Let's listen to John Kander sit
on one pitch level and then

00:48:08.693 --> 00:48:10.360
suddenly raise the whole thing
up.

00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:14.539
Raising up music builds
excitement.

00:48:14.539 --> 00:48:33.909
&gt;
 

00:48:33.909 --> 00:48:36.500
Now he builds--I think this is
the last question.

00:48:36.500 --> 00:48:38.929
What do we call this last chord?
 

00:48:38.929 --> 00:48:40.628
What &lt;&lt;music
playing&gt;&gt;

00:48:40.628 --> 00:48:41.039
chord?
 

00:48:41.039 --> 00:48:44.369
It's the--Anybody remember the
second most important pitch?

00:48:44.369 --> 00:48:45.639
The dominant.
 

00:48:45.639 --> 00:48:59.510
So let's watch John Kander sit
on the dominant chord now

00:48:59.510 --> 00:49:07.329
&gt;
 

00:49:07.329 --> 00:49:10.010
and now you sing the tonic.
 

00:49:10.010 --> 00:49:11.505
&gt;
 

00:49:11.505 --> 00:49:13.750
&gt;
 

00:49:13.750 --> 00:49:17.239
And okay, hit the tonic.
 

00:49:17.239 --> 00:49:18.679
&gt;
 

00:49:18.679 --> 00:49:28.110
&gt;
 

00:49:28.110 --> 00:49:28.920
Okay.
 

00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:30.840
So these are the kinds of
things we will be doing.

00:49:30.840 --> 00:49:33.864
If you decide to take this
course, get a hold of the

00:49:33.864 --> 00:49:37.246
materials for next Tuesday,
do listening exercises one and

00:49:37.246 --> 00:49:38.670
nine through eleven.
 

00:49:38.670 --> 00:49:39.519
I'll see you then.
 

00:49:39.519 --> 00:49:45.000

00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:05.260
Prof: Before we start
today's lecture,

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:10.130
I just wanted to explain to you
that at the end of the class,

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:14.710
I have to run out and catch a
plane.

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:17.822
So if you have to discuss any
other administrative matters,

00:00:17.822 --> 00:00:20.613
you should do it now,
because you won't find me after

00:00:20.613 --> 00:00:21.150
class.
 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.240
I couldn't take this weather.
 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.020
You know where I'm going?
 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.420
Seattle.
 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:33.640
That's the story of my life.
 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.780
So nothing else?
 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:36.870
Yes?
 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.568
Student:  Is there going
to be an equation sheet for the

00:00:39.568 --> 00:00:41.570
midterm and if so,
is it possible to get it?

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:42.560
Prof: You will get the
equation sheet.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:43.460
Do you want it now?
 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:44.110
No.
 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:44.960
With the exam?
 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.720
Yeah.
 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:52.206
I don't give it out before,
but you will have all the

00:00:52.206 --> 00:00:56.110
reasonable equations on that
sheet.

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:58.810
You know the reason for that,
right?

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:03.655
The reason is that some of you
may be going into medicine and

00:01:03.655 --> 00:01:08.260
you control the anesthesia on
me, one of these days in the

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:09.150
future.
 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.313
If I held back the equation
sheet, I know you will hold back

00:01:14.313 --> 00:01:15.890
the painkillers.
 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.539
It's just making a deal,
the way things are done

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:19.159
nowadays.
 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:22.860
I made a deal with you guys.
 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.519
I couldn't sleep last night,
because today is when we're

00:01:26.519 --> 00:01:30.180
going to solve Maxwell's
equations and get the waves.

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.629
I just couldn't wait to get to
work.

00:01:31.629 --> 00:01:32.019
It's great.
 

00:01:32.019 --> 00:01:36.532
No matter how many times I talk
about it, I just find it so

00:01:36.532 --> 00:01:37.310
amazing.
 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.720
So here are these great Maxwell
equations.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:41.840
I'm going to write them down.
 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:02:23.199
 
 

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:26.090
Those are the equations.
 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.397
The first one tells you that if
you draw any surface and

00:02:29.397 --> 00:02:31.894
integrate
B over that surface,

00:02:31.894 --> 00:02:35.705
namely, you're counting the net
number of lines coming out,

00:02:35.705 --> 00:02:37.348
you're going to get 0.
 

00:02:37.348 --> 00:02:40.496
That's because lines begin and
end with charges and there are

00:02:40.496 --> 00:02:41.650
no magnetic charges.
 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.747
If you look at any magnetic
field problem,

00:02:43.747 --> 00:02:46.050
the lines don't have a
beginning or an end.

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.199
They end on themselves.
 

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:51.791
So if you put any surface
there, whatever goes in has to

00:02:51.791 --> 00:02:52.508
come out.
 

00:02:52.508 --> 00:02:55.020
That's the statement of no
magnetic charges.

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.193
This one says,
yes, there are things that

00:02:57.193 --> 00:02:59.910
manufacture electric field lines
called charges.

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.718
They make them and they eat
them.

00:03:01.718 --> 00:03:05.936
Depending on how many got in
the volume, the net will decide

00:03:05.936 --> 00:03:08.080
the flux out of that volume.
 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.269
This one, without that,
used to say electric field is a

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:12.508
conservative field.
 

00:03:12.508 --> 00:03:14.878
It defines a potential and so
on.

00:03:14.878 --> 00:03:17.543
But then we found in the time
dependent problem,

00:03:17.543 --> 00:03:20.943
E⋅dl,
we said rate of change of the

00:03:20.943 --> 00:03:22.020
magnetic field.
 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:25.740
So changing magnetic field
sustains an electric field.

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:29.229
And this one says a changing
electric field can produce a

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:30.288
magnetic field.
 

00:03:30.288 --> 00:03:32.801
In addition,
a current can also produce a

00:03:32.801 --> 00:03:33.870
magnetic field.
 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:39.090
This is what we have to begin
with.

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.628
Now I'm going to eventually
focus on free space.

00:03:43.628 --> 00:03:49.949
Free space means we're nowhere
near charges and currents.

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:52.400
And the equations become more
symmetric.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.244
This has got no surface
integral, that has got no

00:03:55.244 --> 00:03:56.370
surface integral.
 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.730
The line integral of this guy
is essentially the rate of

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.258
change of flux of that.
 

00:04:01.258 --> 00:04:08.555
And the line integral of that
guy is - the rate of change of

00:04:08.555 --> 00:04:10.408
flux of this.
 

00:04:10.408 --> 00:04:14.431
If I'm going to get a wave
equation, the triumphant moment

00:04:14.431 --> 00:04:18.949
is when I do this and do that
and out comes the wave equation.

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:23.254
But if at that moment you have
not seen the wave equation,

00:04:23.254 --> 00:04:26.050
you're not going to get the
thrill.

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.177
So I have to know,
how many people remember the

00:04:29.177 --> 00:04:32.579
wave equation from the first
part of the course?

00:04:32.579 --> 00:04:36.430
Okay, so I think I have to
remind you of what that is.

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.177
It's a bit like explaining a
joke, but still,

00:04:39.177 --> 00:04:42.235
I have to do that,
because otherwise we won't have

00:04:42.235 --> 00:04:43.860
that climactic moment.
 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.389
So let me tell you one example
of a wave equation.

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:49.029
People have seen them before.
 

00:04:49.029 --> 00:04:50.980
Here is the simplest example.
 

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:54.995
You take a string,
you tie it between two fixed

00:04:54.995 --> 00:04:58.399
points and it has a tension
T.

00:04:58.399 --> 00:05:02.269
Tension is the force with which
the two ends are being pulled.

00:05:02.269 --> 00:05:06.853
Then you distort it in some
form and you release it,

00:05:06.853 --> 00:05:09.278
and you see what happens.
 

00:05:09.278 --> 00:05:16.478
Now let's measure x as
the distance from the left end

00:05:16.478 --> 00:05:22.699
and y as the height at
that time t.

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:27.432
The wave equation tells you an
equation governing the behavior

00:05:27.432 --> 00:05:28.519
of y.
 

00:05:28.519 --> 00:05:31.778
It tells you how y
varies.

00:05:31.778 --> 00:05:35.086
Now if you want to do that,
you may think you have to

00:05:35.086 --> 00:05:37.250
invent new stuff,
but you don't.

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:40.009
Everything comes from Newton's
laws.

00:05:40.009 --> 00:05:43.786
That's to me the amazing part,
that you have these equations,

00:05:43.786 --> 00:05:46.620
then of course the Lorentz
force equations.

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:49.367
Then you've got Newton's laws
and that's all we have up to

00:05:49.367 --> 00:05:50.670
this point in the course.
 

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:53.942
So there should be no need to
invoke anything beyond Newton's

00:05:53.942 --> 00:05:56.290
laws to find out the fate of
this string.

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:59.000
And namely, we are going to
apply F = ma,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.519
but not to the whole string at
one time,

00:06:01.519 --> 00:06:04.036
because a is the
acceleration and whose

00:06:04.036 --> 00:06:06.050
acceleration are we talking
about?

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:07.889
Piece of string here,
piece of string there?

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:10.490
It can all be moving at
different rates.

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:14.360
So you pick a tiny portion,
which I'm going to blow up for

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:15.379
your benefit.
 

00:06:15.379 --> 00:06:17.620
That's a piece of string.
 

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:21.411
Its interval,
it lies under region of length

00:06:21.411 --> 00:06:22.470
dx.
 

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:25.910
In other words,
you take a dx here and

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:27.629
look at that string.
 

00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:32.572
It is being pulled like that
with a tension T and it's

00:06:32.572 --> 00:06:37.019
being pulled like this with a
tension T here.

00:06:37.019 --> 00:06:40.860
That's the meaning of tension,
pulled at both ends.

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:43.648
If this was a perfectly
straight segment,

00:06:43.648 --> 00:06:47.553
there'll be no net force on it,
because these forces will

00:06:47.553 --> 00:06:48.319
cancel.
 

00:06:48.319 --> 00:06:52.821
But if it's slightly curved,
then this line and that line

00:06:52.821 --> 00:06:57.242
are not quite in the same
direction and the forces don't

00:06:57.242 --> 00:06:58.769
have to cancel.
 

00:06:58.769 --> 00:07:03.028
So let's take that force and
write its vertical part.

00:07:03.028 --> 00:07:06.860
If this angle is
θ,

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:12.297
T times
sinθ is the force

00:07:12.297 --> 00:07:13.410
here.
 

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:18.365
-T times (because
T is pointing the

00:07:18.365 --> 00:07:21.872
opposite way)--
let me call this

00:07:21.872 --> 00:07:28.333
θ_1 and
θ_2 is

00:07:28.333 --> 00:07:31.290
the angle you have here.
 

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:32.209
Do you understand?
 

00:07:32.209 --> 00:07:36.476
The vertical force is restoring
the strength to where it was is

00:07:36.476 --> 00:07:37.990
what I'm focused on.
 

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:40.622
So you resolve that force into
a vertical part,

00:07:40.622 --> 00:07:43.199
up and this one has the
vertical part down.

00:07:43.199 --> 00:07:45.523
Now if θ_1 =
θ_2 they

00:07:45.523 --> 00:07:46.980
cancel and that's what I just
said.

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:48.565
But θ_1
and θ_2

00:07:48.565 --> 00:07:50.730
are generally not equal,
because if I go to the top of

00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:52.273
the string,
for example,

00:07:52.273 --> 00:07:56.110
this end is pulling this way,
that end is pulling that way.

00:07:56.110 --> 00:07:58.420
There's a net force down.
 

00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:02.533
So you have a net force because
this angle or the tangent to the

00:08:02.533 --> 00:08:04.819
string is changing with
position.

00:08:04.819 --> 00:08:06.930
That's why they don't cancel.
 

00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:10.910
Now the approximation I'm going
to make is that theta is small,

00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:14.250
measured in radians,
and I remind you that

00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:19.055
sinθ is essentially
θ - very small

00:08:19.055 --> 00:08:20.360
corrections.
 

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:24.975
And cosine θ is 1
− θ^(2)/2

00:08:24.975 --> 00:08:26.089
corrections.
 

00:08:26.089 --> 00:08:29.682
And tanθ,
which is the ratio of these

00:08:29.682 --> 00:08:32.908
guys, is θ other
corrections.

00:08:32.908 --> 00:08:35.173
For a very small
θ,

00:08:35.173 --> 00:08:37.730
you forget that,
you forget that.

00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:42.529
You keep things of order theta
in every equation.

00:08:42.529 --> 00:08:44.500
So for small angles,
cosine is just 1,

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:46.740
and sinθ is
θ.

00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:48.970
If you do that,
and sinθ and

00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:52.590
tanθ being equal,
I can write it as

00:08:52.590 --> 00:08:59.190
tanθ_1 -
tanθ_2.

00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:01.660
But that's in the
approximation,

00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:05.090
where tan and sine are all
roughly equal.

00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:11.552
That is really T times
dy/dx at the point x

00:09:11.552 --> 00:09:15.825
dx −
dy/dx at the point

00:09:15.825 --> 00:09:17.250
x.
 

00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:17.620
Are you with me?
 

00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:20.259
dy/dx from calculus,
you remember,

00:09:20.259 --> 00:09:21.250
is the slope.
 

00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:23.590
It's a partial derivative.
 

00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:25.799
Why is it a partial derivative
now?

00:09:25.799 --> 00:09:28.950
Can you tell me?
 

00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:29.798
Yes?
 

00:09:29.798 --> 00:09:30.519
Student:  It's all
dependent on time.

00:09:30.519 --> 00:09:33.091
Prof: It can depend on
time and I'm doing F = ma

00:09:33.091 --> 00:09:34.399
at one instant in time.
 

00:09:34.399 --> 00:09:36.726
So I don't want to take this
guy's slope now and that guy's

00:09:36.726 --> 00:09:37.610
slope an hour later.
 

00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:42.309
I want them at the same time,
at a fixed time.

00:09:42.309 --> 00:09:46.490
Now what do I do with this?
 

00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:52.298
Have I taught you guys how to
handle a difference like this?

00:09:52.298 --> 00:09:56.129
There's one legacy I want to
leave behind is what to do when

00:09:56.129 --> 00:09:58.789
confronted with a difference
like this.

00:09:58.789 --> 00:10:03.490
You have any idea what to do?
 

00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:04.320
Pardon me?
 

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:07.350
Student:  Multiply by
one.

00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:10.659
Prof: Multiply by one.
 

00:10:10.659 --> 00:10:13.009
Then what do you do with that?
 

00:10:13.009 --> 00:10:15.985
I'm asking you to evaluate the
difference between this guy at

00:10:15.985 --> 00:10:18.120
x dx - the same thing at
x.

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:25.695
What is it equal to
approximately for small

00:10:25.695 --> 00:10:27.860
dx?
 

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:29.470
Let me ask you another question.
 

00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:34.078
Suppose I have f of x
dx and I subtract from it

00:10:34.078 --> 00:10:37.460
f of x,
what is it equal to?

00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:48.428
Student: 
&gt;

00:10:48.428 --> 00:10:51.424
Prof: If I divide by
Δx and take the

00:10:51.424 --> 00:10:53.158
limit, it becomes a derivative.
 

00:10:53.158 --> 00:10:55.345
If I don't divide by
Δx,

00:10:55.345 --> 00:10:58.450
this is then df/dx
times Δx.

00:10:58.450 --> 00:11:02.485
There may be other corrections,
but when Δx goes

00:11:02.485 --> 00:11:05.090
to 0, you may make that
approximation.

00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:06.950
That is the meaning of the rate
of change.

00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:08.773
If I tell you,
here's a function and that's

00:11:08.773 --> 00:11:10.988
the same function somewhere to
the right, what's the

00:11:10.988 --> 00:11:11.639
difference?
 

00:11:11.639 --> 00:11:13.777
That's what the role of the
derivative is,

00:11:13.777 --> 00:11:15.548
to tell you how much it
changes.

00:11:15.548 --> 00:11:17.690
This slope changes from here to
there,

00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:20.767
therefore it's a derivative of
something which is already a

00:11:20.767 --> 00:11:24.214
derivative,
so it's d^(2)y/dx^(2)

00:11:24.214 --> 00:11:26.629
times Δx.
 

00:11:26.629 --> 00:11:29.455
In other words,
the f I'm using here is itself

00:11:29.455 --> 00:11:32.467
dy/dx and the
df/dx is then the

00:11:32.467 --> 00:11:33.850
second derivative.
 

00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:36.649
So that's the force.
 

00:11:36.649 --> 00:11:43.190
Now that force we must equate
to ma.

00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:44.240
That's the easy part.
 

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:48.330
What is the mass of this
section, this portion of string?

00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:54.221
If the mass per unit length is
μ, that's the mass of that

00:11:54.221 --> 00:11:55.220
section.
 

00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:57.308
Then what's the acceleration.
 

00:11:57.308 --> 00:12:00.610
Acceleration is the rate at
which y is going up and down.

00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:05.519
That is d^(2)y/dt^(2).
 

00:12:05.519 --> 00:12:14.916
Canceling the Δx,
we get this wave equation which

00:12:14.916 --> 00:12:23.095
says d^(2)y/dx^(2) -
μ over T

00:12:23.095 --> 00:12:29.662
d^(2)y/dt^(2) is 0,
and that's the origin of the

00:12:29.662 --> 00:12:30.288
wave equation.
 

00:12:30.288 --> 00:12:34.530
Any time you get something like
this, you call it the wave

00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:35.350
equation.
 

00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:42.436
I'm going to write this as
d^(2)y/dx^(2) - 1 over

00:12:42.436 --> 00:12:47.590
v^(2) d^(2)y/dt^(2 )= 0
where v is

00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:51.070
√(T/μ).
 

00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:54.482
I use the symbol v,
because this will turn out to

00:12:54.482 --> 00:12:57.090
be the velocity of waves on that
string.

00:12:57.090 --> 00:13:00.162
Namely, if you pluck the string
and make a little bump here,

00:13:00.162 --> 00:13:03.234
let it go, the bump will move
and v is going to be the speed

00:13:03.234 --> 00:13:04.379
at which it moves.
 

00:13:04.379 --> 00:13:08.443
The speed of waves is
determined by the tension and

00:13:08.443 --> 00:13:10.639
the mass per unit length.
 

00:13:10.639 --> 00:13:14.495
Now I want to show you that
this really is the velocity of

00:13:14.495 --> 00:13:15.240
the wave.
 

00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:17.009
How do we know that's the
velocity?

00:13:17.009 --> 00:13:19.917
It's got dimensions of
velocity, but maybe it's not the

00:13:19.917 --> 00:13:21.210
velocity of this wave.
 

00:13:21.210 --> 00:13:23.080
Maybe it's something else.
 

00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:26.690
I want to show you that
v stands for the velocity

00:13:26.690 --> 00:13:28.658
of the waves in this medium.
 

00:13:28.658 --> 00:13:33.039
The way you do that is you ask
yourself, what is the nature of

00:13:33.039 --> 00:13:35.408
the solutions to this equation?
 

00:13:35.408 --> 00:13:41.196
If y(x,t) satisfied the
equation, what can you say about

00:13:41.196 --> 00:13:43.250
its functional form?
 

00:13:43.250 --> 00:13:46.178
What functions do you think
will play a role?

00:13:46.178 --> 00:13:53.384
Does anybody have any idea what
kind of functions may play a

00:13:53.384 --> 00:13:54.240
role?
 

00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:55.379
Student:  Sine function?
 

00:13:55.379 --> 00:13:57.029
Prof: Sines maybe.
 

00:13:57.029 --> 00:13:59.255
With single oscillators,
when you have something

00:13:59.255 --> 00:14:01.481
something is d/dt
squared, you had cosine

00:14:01.481 --> 00:14:02.428
ωt.
 

00:14:02.428 --> 00:14:04.960
Whatever you can do for t
you can do for x.

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:06.558
You can have a cosine in
x.

00:14:06.558 --> 00:14:09.293
So you might think it is all
sines and cosines and

00:14:09.293 --> 00:14:10.129
exponentials.
 

00:14:10.129 --> 00:14:14.424
All that is true,
but it turns out the range of

00:14:14.424 --> 00:14:17.879
solutions is much bigger than
that.

00:14:17.879 --> 00:14:20.702
I'm going to write down for you
the most generation solution to

00:14:20.702 --> 00:14:22.933
the wave equation,
namely what's the constraint it

00:14:22.933 --> 00:14:24.210
imposes on the function?
 

00:14:24.210 --> 00:14:31.907
The answer is this - y
can be any function you want of

00:14:31.907 --> 00:14:33.960
x - vt.
 

00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:37.538
I don't care what function it
is.

00:14:37.538 --> 00:14:42.774
So if I call z as a
single variable x - vt,

00:14:42.774 --> 00:14:47.726
y can be a function of
this single combination,

00:14:47.726 --> 00:14:49.408
x - vt.
 

00:14:49.408 --> 00:14:51.221
In other words,
y can depend on x

00:14:51.221 --> 00:14:53.269
and y can depend on
t. If it depends on

00:14:53.269 --> 00:14:55.120
x and t in an
arbitrary way,

00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:57.320
of course it won't satisfy this
equation.

00:14:57.320 --> 00:15:00.952
But I'm telling you that if it
depends on x and t

00:15:00.952 --> 00:15:03.532
only through this combination,
x - vt,

00:15:03.532 --> 00:15:05.759
it will satisfy the wave
equation.

00:15:05.759 --> 00:15:07.379
In other words,
here's the function.

00:15:07.379 --> 00:15:11.299
You don't even have to
think, x - vt squared

00:15:11.299 --> 00:15:14.750
over some number
x_0^(2).

00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:17.649
That's a completely good
solution to the wave equation.

00:15:17.649 --> 00:15:21.958
I guarantee if you took this,
it would satisfy the wave

00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:26.028
equation, because it's a
function only of x - vt.

00:15:26.028 --> 00:15:30.186
A function that's not a good
function is y = e^(

00:15:30.186 --> 00:15:33.178
−x2) −
v^(2)t^(2).

00:15:33.178 --> 00:15:35.558
That's not a function of x -
vt.

00:15:35.558 --> 00:15:42.340
That won't satisfy the wave
equation.

00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:46.860
So why is that true is what I
want to show you.

00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:51.710
Let us take dy/dx.
 

00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:58.351
Remember, y depends only
on this combination z,

00:15:58.351 --> 00:16:04.330
therefore it equals df/dz
times dz/dx.

00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:09.318
But z is x - vt,
dz/dx is 1,

00:16:09.318 --> 00:16:12.230
so it's just df/dz.
 

00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:14.879
Now let me rush through this
and do it one more time.

00:16:14.879 --> 00:16:16.570
Everything will go the same way.
 

00:16:16.570 --> 00:16:21.250
You will get this.
 

00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:27.690
But how about dy/dt?
 

00:16:27.690 --> 00:16:33.107
If you want dy/dt,
again you take df/dz

00:16:33.107 --> 00:16:35.928
times dz/dt.
 

00:16:35.928 --> 00:16:40.647
But that gives you--this should
be written as a

00:16:40.647 --> 00:16:46.389
partial--dz/dt is
df/dz times -v.

00:16:46.389 --> 00:16:47.889
Can you see that?
 

00:16:47.889 --> 00:16:50.221
By the chain rule,
you take any function you have,

00:16:50.221 --> 00:16:52.460
first differentiate with
respect to z.

00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:54.908
Then differentiate z
with respect to x and

00:16:54.908 --> 00:16:56.110
with respect to t.
 

00:16:56.110 --> 00:16:57.629
If you do an x
derivative, you get 1.

00:16:57.629 --> 00:16:59.562
If you do a t
derivative,

00:16:59.562 --> 00:17:00.808
you get -v.
 

00:17:00.808 --> 00:17:03.732
Now if I do it twice--again,
I don't want to spend too much

00:17:03.732 --> 00:17:05.951
time--if I do it twice,
I'm going to skip the

00:17:05.951 --> 00:17:07.058
intermediate step.
 

00:17:07.058 --> 00:17:12.058
I'll get a -v and a
−v^(2).

00:17:12.058 --> 00:17:15.880
It follows then that if I took
1/v^(2) times that,

00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:17.450
can you see that now?
 

00:17:17.450 --> 00:17:27.458
1/v^(2) d^(2)y/dt^(2) is
the same as v^(2)y

00:17:27.458 --> 00:17:29.960
dx^(2).
 

00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:32.160
Therefore to satisfy the wave
equation,

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:35.724
it can be any function at all,
as long as it depends on

00:17:35.724 --> 00:17:39.490
x and t in the
combination x - vt.

00:17:39.490 --> 00:17:40.828
That is just a mathematical
fact.

00:17:40.828 --> 00:17:43.506
You just have to do the chain
rule, you will find that it's

00:17:43.506 --> 00:17:43.828
true.
 

00:17:43.828 --> 00:17:46.612
But more importantly,
I want you to understand what

00:17:46.612 --> 00:17:48.950
it tells you about the wave
propagation.

00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:51.608
Let me pick x_0
= 1 for convenience.

00:17:51.608 --> 00:17:55.890
Let me plot this guy at time
t = 0.

00:17:55.890 --> 00:18:00.619
This solution looks like
e to the -x

00:18:00.619 --> 00:18:06.220
squared, which is a function
like that, at t = 0.

00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:10.160
What does it look like at t
= 1 second?

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:11.519
Think about it.
 

00:18:11.519 --> 00:18:15.493
t = 1 second looks like
e to the -x - v

00:18:15.493 --> 00:18:16.940
whole squared.
 

00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:22.390
That means it's the same bump,
shifted by an amount v.

00:18:22.390 --> 00:18:25.796
See this function x - v
squared behaves with respect to

00:18:25.796 --> 00:18:28.700
x = v the same as the
original function around

00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:29.650
x = 0.
 

00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:32.761
Whatever happens to this guy
here happens to that guy at

00:18:32.761 --> 00:18:34.630
distance v to the right.
 

00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:37.492
You can see that if you wait
t seconds,

00:18:37.492 --> 00:18:40.230
it would have moved a distance
vt.

00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:43.730
That's why you understand that
vt,

00:18:43.730 --> 00:18:45.900
v is the velocity of
propagation,

00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:49.053
because what this is telling
you is that if you start the

00:18:49.053 --> 00:18:52.150
system out with some
configuration at time t,

00:18:52.150 --> 00:18:55.070
t = 0,
later on the function looks

00:18:55.070 --> 00:18:58.722
like the same function
translated to the right at a

00:18:58.722 --> 00:19:00.328
velocity v.
 

00:19:00.328 --> 00:19:04.124
That means its profile,
whatever profile you have,

00:19:04.124 --> 00:19:06.368
is just moved to the right.
 

00:19:06.368 --> 00:19:16.241
Now can you think of another
family of solutions besides this

00:19:16.241 --> 00:19:17.230
one?
 

00:19:17.230 --> 00:19:21.720
Why should the wave move to the
right?

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:22.608
Yes?
 

00:19:22.608 --> 00:19:25.098
Student:  It's x
vt.

00:19:25.098 --> 00:19:27.348
Prof: Do you understand
that if it was x vt,

00:19:27.348 --> 00:19:30.252
you go through this derivation,
you'd get a v^(2)

00:19:30.252 --> 00:19:32.758
instead of a
−v^(2) and that

00:19:32.758 --> 00:19:33.838
doesn't matter.
 

00:19:33.838 --> 00:19:37.126
So the answer is,
the most general solution to

00:19:37.126 --> 00:19:40.853
the wave equation is any
function you like of x -

00:19:40.853 --> 00:19:44.358
vt any function you like of
x vt.

00:19:44.358 --> 00:19:46.220
This will describe waves going
to the right;

00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:48.713
that will describe waves going
to the left, and you can

00:19:48.713 --> 00:19:49.500
superpose them.
 

00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:53.509
Because it's a linear equation,
you can add solutions.

00:19:53.509 --> 00:19:55.848
This is what I want you to know
about the wave equation.

00:19:55.848 --> 00:20:01.108
This is one example of how the
wave equation comes and what the

00:20:01.108 --> 00:20:03.568
meaning of the symbol v is.
 

00:20:03.568 --> 00:20:08.480
Now let me go to the old
Maxwell equations.

00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:11.910
Now I want to do them and ask
myself.

00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:16.474
I'm going to write down a
solution and I'm going to see if

00:20:16.474 --> 00:20:19.680
it obeys these four Maxwell
equations.

00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:23.429
If I write down a solution for
the electric field and the

00:20:23.429 --> 00:20:26.241
magnetic field,
they have to obey all those

00:20:26.241 --> 00:20:28.720
conditions, those four
equations.

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:32.356
That means, let's take first
the case of working in a vacuum,

00:20:32.356 --> 00:20:35.509
when there is no current,
when there is no charge.

00:20:35.509 --> 00:20:37.240
So you want a surface integral
of

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:43.751
E on any surface to be 0
and the surface integral of

00:20:43.751 --> 00:20:47.568
B on any surface to be 0.
 

00:20:47.568 --> 00:20:50.819
Look at the surface integral
first.

00:20:50.819 --> 00:20:51.338
Do you understand?
 

00:20:51.338 --> 00:20:53.470
This was never going to be
non-zero.

00:20:53.470 --> 00:20:56.150
This will be non-zero near
matter but we are far from any

00:20:56.150 --> 00:20:58.829
charges, so there is nothing to
enclose in the volume.

00:20:58.829 --> 00:21:01.079
There are no charges there.
 

00:21:01.079 --> 00:21:02.170
Look at those equations.
 

00:21:02.170 --> 00:21:05.224
I give you a function and I
say, "Tell me if it

00:21:05.224 --> 00:21:07.321
satisfies Maxwell's
equations,"

00:21:07.321 --> 00:21:08.940
what do you have to do?
 

00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:14.618
Operationally,
what is it that you have to do?

00:21:14.618 --> 00:21:24.559
Any ideas on what you must do
at this point to test?

00:21:24.559 --> 00:21:26.078
Any ideas?
 

00:21:26.078 --> 00:21:33.269
What do you have to see of a
potential solution?

00:21:33.269 --> 00:21:34.509
Come on, this is not the New
York subway.

00:21:34.509 --> 00:21:36.630
You can make eye contact.
 

00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:38.250
What is this?
 

00:21:38.250 --> 00:21:41.269
You have no idea what you may
have to do?

00:21:41.269 --> 00:21:45.372
What if I give you a function
and say, "See if it

00:21:45.372 --> 00:21:47.926
satisfies the wave
equation,"

00:21:47.926 --> 00:21:49.940
what will you do then?
 

00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:51.329
Take the function and then what?
 

00:21:51.329 --> 00:21:52.170
Yes?
 

00:21:52.170 --> 00:21:53.500
Student:  Differentiate
it and see--

00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:54.140
Prof: Yes!
 

00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:56.165
Take x derivative,
y derivative and all

00:21:56.165 --> 00:21:57.180
that, second derivative.
 

00:21:57.180 --> 00:21:59.229
If it vanishes,
you'll say it satisfies it,

00:21:59.229 --> 00:21:59.618
right?
 

00:21:59.618 --> 00:22:01.430
That's what it means to satisfy
it.

00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:05.053
If I give you fields
E and B that

00:22:05.053 --> 00:22:10.010
depends on space and time and I
want you to verify if it

00:22:10.010 --> 00:22:13.435
satisfies this,
what do you have to do,

00:22:13.435 --> 00:22:15.598
is what I'm asking?
 

00:22:15.598 --> 00:22:17.700
Student:  Come up with a
situation?

00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:18.875
Prof: No,
it must be true in every

00:22:18.875 --> 00:22:19.230
situation.
 

00:22:19.230 --> 00:22:22.074
In other words,
what's the surface on which

00:22:22.074 --> 00:22:23.700
this integral is done?
 

00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:26.849
On what surface do we do the
integral?

00:22:26.849 --> 00:22:27.509
Pardon me?
 

00:22:27.509 --> 00:22:28.569
Student:  Closed.
 

00:22:28.569 --> 00:22:29.588
Prof: Closed.
 

00:22:29.588 --> 00:22:31.210
But beyond closed,
anything else?

00:22:31.210 --> 00:22:31.980
Where is it located?
 

00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:36.480
How big is it?
 

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:37.078
Pardon me?
 

00:22:37.078 --> 00:22:41.019
Student: 
&gt;

00:22:41.019 --> 00:22:42.259
Prof: I didn't hear that.
 

00:22:42.259 --> 00:22:43.210
Student:  It's
everywhere.

00:22:43.210 --> 00:22:46.041
Prof: It could be
anywhere and it could have any

00:22:46.041 --> 00:22:46.410
size.
 

00:22:46.410 --> 00:22:47.920
It could have any shape.
 

00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:52.029
And it must be true for all
those surfaces.

00:22:52.029 --> 00:22:54.387
So if I just give you a field,
E (x,y,z and

00:22:54.387 --> 00:22:56.170
t), it's a lot of work,
right?

00:22:56.170 --> 00:22:58.150
Draw all possible surfaces.
 

00:22:58.150 --> 00:23:01.471
On them, you can take the
surface, divide it into patches,

00:23:01.471 --> 00:23:04.853
do the surface integral patch
by patch, and you better keep

00:23:04.853 --> 00:23:05.670
getting 0.
 

00:23:05.670 --> 00:23:08.980
When you're done with that,
then you take the magnetic

00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:09.480
field.
 

00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:12.712
Then the other two Maxwells
tell you, take a loop,

00:23:12.712 --> 00:23:16.868
any loop, go round that and do
the line integral of B.

00:23:16.868 --> 00:23:19.534
That should be the flux
crossing it, the electric flux

00:23:19.534 --> 00:23:20.490
or magnetic flux.
 

00:23:20.490 --> 00:23:23.660
And it should be done for every
loop and for every surface.

00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:26.348
You realize that looks
impossible.

00:23:26.348 --> 00:23:30.910
But there is a quicker way to
verify all of these equations,

00:23:30.910 --> 00:23:37.976
and the quick way is the
following - if these equations

00:23:37.976 --> 00:23:42.951
are true for a tiny loop,
in this case,

00:23:42.951 --> 00:23:48.599
true for a tiny volume or a
tiny surface enclosing a tiny

00:23:48.599 --> 00:23:54.298
volume,
then it's true for big ones.

00:23:54.298 --> 00:23:59.459
And likewise,
if true for a tiny loop,

00:23:59.459 --> 00:24:04.480
it is true for any arbitrary
loop.

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:06.846
In other words,
if I can show that at any

00:24:06.846 --> 00:24:10.561
arbitrary point,
if I pick an infinitesimal loop

00:24:10.561 --> 00:24:14.244
or infinitesimal surface,
and these guys satisfy these

00:24:14.244 --> 00:24:16.180
equations on an infinitesimal
thing,

00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:19.519
it's going to satisfy it on a
macroscopic thing.

00:24:19.519 --> 00:24:21.529
That's what we want to
understand.

00:24:21.529 --> 00:24:24.200
How does that come about?
 

00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:29.166
It comes about due to a very
beautiful way in which we define

00:24:29.166 --> 00:24:31.319
the sum of two surfaces.
 

00:24:31.319 --> 00:24:35.769
So here is a surface.
 

00:24:35.769 --> 00:24:37.855
I'm going to take everything to
be a cube, but it's not

00:24:37.855 --> 00:24:38.319
important.
 

00:24:38.319 --> 00:24:40.078
Here's a surface.
 

00:24:40.078 --> 00:24:41.779
Let's call it
S_1.

00:24:41.779 --> 00:24:43.680
And it's got its outward normal.
 

00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:47.157
That's the definition of
surface integral is you draw the

00:24:47.157 --> 00:24:49.457
normals pointing outwards and
you take

00:24:49.457 --> 00:24:52.873
E⋅dA
on every face of the cube

00:24:52.873 --> 00:24:53.930
and add it.
 

00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:58.936
The area vector is defined to
be outward pointing normal to

00:24:58.936 --> 00:25:00.059
every face.
 

00:25:00.059 --> 00:25:01.890
So you take the little cube.
 

00:25:01.890 --> 00:25:05.396
E may be pointing this
way there or that way there,

00:25:05.396 --> 00:25:09.089
but you take the dot product of
the area and you add them.

00:25:09.089 --> 00:25:16.059
Then I take a second cube here.
 

00:25:16.059 --> 00:25:21.940
Let's see.
 

00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:24.259
It's got its own outward normal.
 

00:25:24.259 --> 00:25:27.920
This is surface 2.
 

00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:33.289
Now imagine gluing this guy to
this guy, so it looks like this.

00:25:33.289 --> 00:25:40.460
You glue this common face.
 

00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:46.327
Bring that surface over and
glue them with that face common

00:25:46.327 --> 00:25:47.338
to both.
 

00:25:47.338 --> 00:25:51.586
Then I claim that the surface
integral on this one the surface

00:25:51.586 --> 00:25:55.693
integral on that one is the
surface integral on the union of

00:25:55.693 --> 00:25:56.529
the two.
 

00:25:56.529 --> 00:26:02.355
In other words,
let's see, take one cube,

00:26:02.355 --> 00:26:09.345
take another cube,
and that surface integral will

00:26:09.345 --> 00:26:14.880
be the same as on a longer
object.

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:18.980
I don't know what this is
called, something over that.

00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:24.440
The two cubes used to be
sharing this.

00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:25.578
Do you understand why?
 

00:26:25.578 --> 00:26:28.882
Let's understand why the
integral on this guy,

00:26:28.882 --> 00:26:32.404
which is, if you want,
two cubes joined to form a

00:26:32.404 --> 00:26:34.019
rectangular solid.
 

00:26:34.019 --> 00:26:38.252
That surface integral is the
sum of these two surface

00:26:38.252 --> 00:26:39.230
integrals.
 

00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:43.440
Think for a minute about why
that is true.

00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:46.256
If you compare them,
piece by piece,

00:26:46.256 --> 00:26:48.670
this face matches that face.
 

00:26:48.670 --> 00:26:50.380
This face matches that half.
 

00:26:50.380 --> 00:26:51.940
This one matches that half.
 

00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:54.671
But something is missing in
this that's present here,

00:26:54.671 --> 00:26:55.460
do you agree?
 

00:26:55.460 --> 00:26:59.230
What is it we don't have?
 

00:26:59.230 --> 00:27:00.069
What's missing in the equal
union?

00:27:00.069 --> 00:27:00.578
Yes?
 

00:27:00.578 --> 00:27:01.868
Student:  Two sides
equal _________.

00:27:01.868 --> 00:27:05.317
Prof: The two common
faces are missing in the big

00:27:05.317 --> 00:27:07.450
surface, but it does not matter.
 

00:27:07.450 --> 00:27:10.420
The two common faces do not
matter because when you do the

00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:13.490
surface on the first one,
the outward normal will point

00:27:13.490 --> 00:27:15.099
out of that,
whereas if you do it on the

00:27:15.099 --> 00:27:17.151
second one,
the outward normal will point

00:27:17.151 --> 00:27:18.288
into the other one.
 

00:27:18.288 --> 00:27:22.492
When you glue them together,
the common face is opposite

00:27:22.492 --> 00:27:23.640
orientations.
 

00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:27.598
Consequently,
the surface integral on the big

00:27:27.598 --> 00:27:33.269
solid is equal to the sum of the
surface in integrals in the two

00:27:33.269 --> 00:27:34.799
small solids.
 

00:27:34.799 --> 00:27:35.450
Do you follow that?
 

00:27:35.450 --> 00:27:36.390
That's the way it works.
 

00:27:36.390 --> 00:27:40.161
Then you can go on adding more
and more pieces to this,

00:27:40.161 --> 00:27:43.653
right, and you can build like
Legos and arbitrarily

00:27:43.653 --> 00:27:45.118
complicated blob.
 

00:27:45.118 --> 00:27:47.432
Remember, these are all very,
very tiny volumes,

00:27:47.432 --> 00:27:49.990
so you can build them up to
look like a big thing.

00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:50.930
It may look like a pyramid.
 

00:27:50.930 --> 00:27:53.910
If you look very closely,
you'll have the steps like in a

00:27:53.910 --> 00:27:56.199
real pyramid,
but the steps here can be made

00:27:56.199 --> 00:27:57.368
arbitrarily small.
 

00:27:57.368 --> 00:28:00.721
Therefore if the surface
integral was 0 on every little

00:28:00.721 --> 00:28:03.019
piece that made up the big
object,

00:28:03.019 --> 00:28:04.720
then it's going to be 0 on the
big object,

00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:08.589
because the integral on the big
object is the integral of the

00:28:08.589 --> 00:28:11.298
tiny pieces that make up the big
object.

00:28:11.298 --> 00:28:14.983
This is a very profound idea,
because the big object has

00:28:14.983 --> 00:28:17.528
fewer surfaces than the small
ones,

00:28:17.528 --> 00:28:21.558
because when you cut it,
you create two new surfaces,

00:28:21.558 --> 00:28:24.029
but they don't contribute
between the two of them,

00:28:24.029 --> 00:28:26.838
because they cancel.
 

00:28:26.838 --> 00:28:29.979
And in particular,
if the surface integral had not

00:28:29.979 --> 00:28:32.953
been 0,
but because of matter it was

00:28:32.953 --> 00:28:37.402
equal to charge inside volume 1,
and this right hand side of

00:28:37.402 --> 00:28:39.910
this one was the charge inside
volume 2,

00:28:39.910 --> 00:28:43.249
you can see that the surface
integral on the bigger surface

00:28:43.249 --> 00:28:45.380
will be the sum of the two
charges.

00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:47.890
So anything you're trying to
prove about surface integrals,

00:28:47.890 --> 00:28:50.068
even if the right hand side is
not 0,

00:28:50.068 --> 00:28:52.984
if it is true in a tiny cube,
true in a union of two cubes

00:28:52.984 --> 00:28:55.849
and then in a union of any
number of these tiny guys,

00:28:55.849 --> 00:28:59.079
therefore on any surface.
 

00:28:59.079 --> 00:29:00.460
That's the thing to remember.
 

00:29:00.460 --> 00:29:04.150
What we will do then is not to
take arbitrary surfaces,

00:29:04.150 --> 00:29:07.244
but infinitesimal surfaces and
we'll prove for them that the

00:29:07.244 --> 00:29:10.497
Maxwell equations are satisfied
for the solution that I come up

00:29:10.497 --> 00:29:10.970
with.
 

00:29:10.970 --> 00:29:14.932
Then you're guaranteed that it
will work for an arbitrary

00:29:14.932 --> 00:29:15.640
surface.
 

00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:18.858
When you do line
integrals--this is for surface

00:29:18.858 --> 00:29:21.730
integral--line integral is even
easier.

00:29:21.730 --> 00:29:26.665
Suppose I'm taking the line
integral of some function around

00:29:26.665 --> 00:29:27.670
this loop.
 

00:29:27.670 --> 00:29:29.150
This is loop
L_1.

00:29:29.150 --> 00:29:34.509
I take a line integral of some
field on L_1.

00:29:34.509 --> 00:29:38.565
Then somebody wants to do a
line integral on

00:29:38.565 --> 00:29:42.808
L_2 that looks
like this,

00:29:42.808 --> 00:29:46.029
E⋅dl
on line 2.

00:29:46.029 --> 00:29:51.276
You agree that this that really
is the same as the line integral

00:29:51.276 --> 00:29:55.940
on the union of the two loops
where you delete the common

00:29:55.940 --> 00:29:56.690
edge.
 

00:29:56.690 --> 00:29:58.358
You have to understand this.
 

00:29:58.358 --> 00:30:00.980
I will not leave any child
behind.

00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:03.108
You have to know why this is
true.

00:30:03.108 --> 00:30:06.230
I'm taking a lot of time so you
know where it's coming from.

00:30:06.230 --> 00:30:08.936
If you compare an integral of
any field on the big rectangle

00:30:08.936 --> 00:30:12.363
compared to the two squares,
the only difference is that the

00:30:12.363 --> 00:30:15.623
two squares had these two sides,
but they were doing them in

00:30:15.623 --> 00:30:19.470
opposite directions,
so it does not matter.

00:30:19.470 --> 00:30:21.588
So if the line integral of
this, for example,

00:30:21.588 --> 00:30:23.759
was some flux coming out of
this one,

00:30:23.759 --> 00:30:26.238
and the line integral of that
was the rate of change of flux

00:30:26.238 --> 00:30:28.065
coming out of that one,
if it was true,

00:30:28.065 --> 00:30:30.663
then it's guaranteed that the
line integral on the big

00:30:30.663 --> 00:30:33.801
rectangle will be the sum of the
fluxes or the rate of the change

00:30:33.801 --> 00:30:35.470
of fluxes coming out of both.
 

00:30:35.470 --> 00:30:38.971
So any Maxwell equation,
if it's true for a tiny square,

00:30:38.971 --> 00:30:42.219
infinitesimal square,
will be also true for anything

00:30:42.219 --> 00:30:42.920
bigger.
 

00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:46.202
There's only one subtlety when
you do loops and that's the

00:30:46.202 --> 00:30:48.680
following - if you're living in
a plane,

00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:51.906
you can prove the result for
the plane in the plane of the

00:30:51.906 --> 00:30:55.155
blackboard,
because there no loop I cannot

00:30:55.155 --> 00:30:57.450
form by joining these guys.
 

00:30:57.450 --> 00:31:02.209
But we live in three dimensions
so that we may have a loop like

00:31:02.209 --> 00:31:05.048
this, floating in three
dimensions.

00:31:05.048 --> 00:31:08.607
Then what you have to do is,
you've got to find any surface

00:31:08.607 --> 00:31:11.368
with a loop as a boundary,
maybe this dome.

00:31:11.368 --> 00:31:14.660
Then the integral on--let me
hide this for you.

00:31:14.660 --> 00:31:18.078
This is the part behind;
this is the part you can see.

00:31:18.078 --> 00:31:22.624
That's the same as tiling it
into little squares and doing an

00:31:22.624 --> 00:31:25.730
integral on each one of them
like this.

00:31:25.730 --> 00:31:28.750
You have a dome of some big
building, you take little tiles

00:31:28.750 --> 00:31:30.210
and you tile the building.
 

00:31:30.210 --> 00:31:35.291
Then all the interior edges
cancel, and all that remains is

00:31:35.291 --> 00:31:39.848
the edge that is the edge of the
original surface.

00:31:39.848 --> 00:31:42.847
So even in 3D it's going to
work, but now you should be

00:31:42.847 --> 00:31:46.180
ready for loops that are not
lying in the xy plane.

00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:49.568
So you will have to prove it
for the three independent loops.

00:31:49.568 --> 00:31:52.454
You will have to prove it for
an infinitesimal loop in that

00:31:52.454 --> 00:31:55.241
plane, infinitesimal in that
plane, infinitesimal in that

00:31:55.241 --> 00:31:55.740
plane.
 

00:31:55.740 --> 00:31:58.816
If it's true for three
independent directions,

00:31:58.816 --> 00:32:02.849
then by combining those little
pieces, you can make yourself

00:32:02.849 --> 00:32:04.558
any surface you want.
 

00:32:04.558 --> 00:32:06.773
In other words,
I'm saying, given a rim,

00:32:06.773 --> 00:32:10.009
you can build any surface with
the rim as the boundary.

00:32:10.009 --> 00:32:13.573
If you can take the little flat
pieces in any orientation,

00:32:13.573 --> 00:32:16.636
and it's enough to have them in
the xy, yz,

00:32:16.636 --> 00:32:18.200
and zx planes.
 

00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:20.210
So the strategy that I'm going
to follow,

00:32:20.210 --> 00:32:23.345
this is something one can skip,
but I wanted you to know the

00:32:23.345 --> 00:32:25.055
details,
if you really want to know

00:32:25.055 --> 00:32:26.308
where everything comes from.
 

00:32:26.308 --> 00:32:29.349
I'm going to write down or
search for a solution to Maxwell

00:32:29.349 --> 00:32:29.980
equations.
 

00:32:29.980 --> 00:32:32.500
I'm going to make it have a
certain form.

00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:34.818
You remember how we do this
with equations.

00:32:34.818 --> 00:32:37.579
We assume a certain form,
stick it into the equation,

00:32:37.579 --> 00:32:39.808
play with some parameters till
it works.

00:32:39.808 --> 00:32:42.638
I'm going to make it work on
infinitesimal loops and

00:32:42.638 --> 00:32:45.578
infinitesimal cubes and that's
going to be enough,

00:32:45.578 --> 00:32:47.250
because if it works on this
tiny loop,

00:32:47.250 --> 00:32:49.338
it works in a big loop,
works in a tiny cube,

00:32:49.338 --> 00:32:54.480
works on a big cube or
arbitrary surface.

00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:59.854
So let us write down the
functional form that I'm going

00:32:59.854 --> 00:33:00.750
to use.
 

00:33:00.750 --> 00:33:08.338
The functional form that I'm
going to use looks like this.

00:33:08.338 --> 00:33:12.924
I'm going to take an electric
field that is entirely in the

00:33:12.924 --> 00:33:17.273
z direction and the
z field will depend on

00:33:17.273 --> 00:33:19.328
y and t.
 

00:33:19.328 --> 00:33:22.373
And I'm going to take a
magnetic field which is going to

00:33:22.373 --> 00:33:25.804
be in the x direction and
the B field is going to

00:33:25.804 --> 00:33:29.180
depend on the y and
t. So let me tell you how my

00:33:29.180 --> 00:33:30.730
axes are defined here.
 

00:33:30.730 --> 00:33:36.190
This is x, this is
y, this is z.

00:33:36.190 --> 00:33:39.390
The electric and magnetic
fields, the electric field will

00:33:39.390 --> 00:33:41.618
always point along the z
axis.

00:33:41.618 --> 00:33:46.318
The magnetic field will always
point along the x axis.

00:33:46.318 --> 00:33:50.336
They will not vary,
as you vary x or

00:33:50.336 --> 00:33:51.390
z.
 

00:33:51.390 --> 00:33:56.750
They'll vary only if you vary
y by assumption.

00:33:56.750 --> 00:33:58.279
In general, it can vary with
everything,

00:33:58.279 --> 00:34:02.781
but I'm trying as a modest goal
to find a simple solution which

00:34:02.781 --> 00:34:07.430
has a dependence on only two of
the four possible coordinates.

00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:10.753
It depends on only y and
t, rather than x,

00:34:10.753 --> 00:34:12.130
y, z and t.
 

00:34:12.130 --> 00:34:13.880
Let's get any solution.
 

00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:15.219
We cannot get every possible
one;

00:34:15.219 --> 00:34:18.425
let's get something and
something, I assume,

00:34:18.425 --> 00:34:19.619
has this form.
 

00:34:19.619 --> 00:34:23.210
So this is called a plane wave,
because if you take the plane

00:34:23.210 --> 00:34:25.483
y = 0,
E and B are

00:34:25.483 --> 00:34:27.099
constant on that plane.
 

00:34:27.099 --> 00:34:29.226
Because when y is fixed
or some value,

00:34:29.226 --> 00:34:32.027
E and B are not
changing as you vary x

00:34:32.027 --> 00:34:32.849
and z.
 

00:34:32.849 --> 00:34:36.059
So you should think of it as
plane after plane and on each

00:34:36.059 --> 00:34:38.199
plane, the field is doing
something.

00:34:38.199 --> 00:34:39.099
It's doing the same thing.
 

00:34:39.099 --> 00:34:43.409
If I draw a plane here,
that field is a constant.

00:34:43.409 --> 00:34:45.992
E is a constant and that
plane and B is a constant

00:34:45.992 --> 00:34:46.650
on that plane.
 

00:34:46.650 --> 00:34:49.842
On another plane,
it could be a different

00:34:49.842 --> 00:34:54.949
constant, but within the plane,
it varies from plane to plane.

00:34:54.949 --> 00:34:57.860
So that is not an axiom,
that's not a law.

00:34:57.860 --> 00:35:02.550
That's an assumed simplicity in
the function I'm looking at.

00:35:02.550 --> 00:35:06.041
There's no theorem that says
that every solution to Maxwell

00:35:06.041 --> 00:35:08.268
equations much obey this
condition.

00:35:08.268 --> 00:35:10.878
In general, these functions
will be functions of x,

00:35:10.878 --> 00:35:12.059
y, z and t.
 

00:35:12.059 --> 00:35:14.420
The trick will be superposition.
 

00:35:14.420 --> 00:35:16.833
If I can get a solution that
depends only y and

00:35:16.833 --> 00:35:18.465
t,
and you can get a solution that

00:35:18.465 --> 00:35:19.690
depends on z and
t,

00:35:19.690 --> 00:35:21.829
I can add them up and they will
still be a solution,

00:35:21.829 --> 00:35:23.739
because the wave equation is
linear.

00:35:23.739 --> 00:35:24.900
You can add solutions.
 

00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:27.869
Then our sum of the two
solutions will be a function of

00:35:27.869 --> 00:35:29.190
y and z.
 

00:35:29.190 --> 00:35:30.820
You can bring in the x
and so on.

00:35:30.820 --> 00:35:34.530
So you do the simplest one,
then you can add them.

00:35:34.530 --> 00:35:39.068
So here is my function and I
have to know what I can say

00:35:39.068 --> 00:35:41.380
about these two functions.
 

00:35:41.380 --> 00:35:42.760
You understand?
 

00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:45.012
In general, the electric field
has three components,

00:35:45.012 --> 00:35:46.869
the magnetic field has three
components.

00:35:46.869 --> 00:35:49.027
Each of them depends on four
quantities, x,

00:35:49.027 --> 00:35:50.179
y, z and t.
 

00:35:50.179 --> 00:35:51.440
Big mess.
 

00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:54.842
In our simplified solution,
the only unknown component of

00:35:54.842 --> 00:35:56.969
E is
E_z.

00:35:56.969 --> 00:35:58.934
I'm assuming there is no
E_x and there

00:35:58.934 --> 00:35:59.989
is no E_y.
 

00:35:59.989 --> 00:36:02.623
And there is no
B_y and there

00:36:02.623 --> 00:36:04.320
is no B_z.
 

00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:06.329
Now you might say,
"Why don't you go a little

00:36:06.329 --> 00:36:06.739
further?
 

00:36:06.739 --> 00:36:09.110
Kill the B also."
 

00:36:09.110 --> 00:36:09.789
You can try that.
 

00:36:09.789 --> 00:36:12.806
If you kill the B,
you will find the only solution

00:36:12.806 --> 00:36:14.530
is to get everything equals 0.
 

00:36:14.530 --> 00:36:17.262
So by trial and error,
we know this is the first time

00:36:17.262 --> 00:36:19.469
you can get something
interesting going.

00:36:19.469 --> 00:36:21.869
If you make it simpler than
that, you get nothing.

00:36:21.869 --> 00:36:26.489
You can make it more
complicated, but not simpler.

00:36:26.489 --> 00:36:30.849
So now, will this satisfy the
surface integral condition?

00:36:30.849 --> 00:36:32.690
Let's check that?
 

00:36:32.690 --> 00:36:35.199
So what do I need to do for
that?

00:36:35.199 --> 00:36:39.019
I have to take a cube, right?
 

00:36:39.019 --> 00:36:41.000
Let me take the cube.
 

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.326
It's infinitesimal,
but I'm just keeping it near

00:36:43.326 --> 00:36:43.969
the origin.
 

00:36:43.969 --> 00:36:47.260
It can be anywhere you want,
but I'm drawing it near the

00:36:47.260 --> 00:36:47.800
origin.
 

00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:51.668
It's a surface,
and it's got these outward

00:36:51.668 --> 00:36:53.179
going normals.
 

00:36:53.179 --> 00:37:00.920
And I must take E ⋅
surface area for every face.

00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:02.679
And I've got to get 0.
 

00:37:02.679 --> 00:37:09.570
That's the condition.
 

00:37:09.570 --> 00:37:11.110
So is that going to work or not?
 

00:37:11.110 --> 00:37:12.610
Let us see.
 

00:37:12.610 --> 00:37:16.858
There are six faces in this
cube, so I'm going to draw 1,2

00:37:16.858 --> 00:37:20.659
and 3 that I can see,
and -1, -2 and -3 refer to the

00:37:20.659 --> 00:37:22.969
faces on the opposite side.
 

00:37:22.969 --> 00:37:26.579
This is 3, that's -3.
 

00:37:26.579 --> 00:37:28.280
So I can only show you 1,2 and
3.

00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:33.219
Let's look at surface 1 and ask
what I get from the surface

00:37:33.219 --> 00:37:35.179
integral of E.
 

00:37:35.179 --> 00:37:38.699
Do you agree that E
points this way?

00:37:38.699 --> 00:37:41.025
So
E⋅dA

00:37:41.025 --> 00:37:44.079
is a non-zero contribution on
surface 1.

00:37:44.079 --> 00:37:48.849
But on surface -1,
E still points up,

00:37:48.849 --> 00:37:51.972
but dA points down,
because E doesn't vary

00:37:51.972 --> 00:37:54.300
from the upper face to the lower
face,

00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:56.059
because in going from upper to
lower,

00:37:56.059 --> 00:37:57.880
I'm varying the coordinate
z,

00:37:57.880 --> 00:38:00.909
but nothing depends on z.
 

00:38:00.909 --> 00:38:03.925
The same electric field is
sitting on the upper plane of

00:38:03.925 --> 00:38:06.449
this cube as on the lower plane
of the cube.

00:38:06.449 --> 00:38:10.764
Therefore the surface integrals
will cancel and give you 0,

00:38:10.764 --> 00:38:13.739
because the area vectors are
opposite.

00:38:13.739 --> 00:38:16.186
That is a simple statement,
that if you've got a constant

00:38:16.186 --> 00:38:17.889
electric field going through a
cube,

00:38:17.889 --> 00:38:21.469
the net flux will be 0 because
what's coming in on one side

00:38:21.469 --> 00:38:23.260
goes out of the other side.
 

00:38:23.260 --> 00:38:28.170
So that's the cancelation of 1
and -1 giving me 0.

00:38:28.170 --> 00:38:33.280
But there are other faces,
like 3 and -3.

00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:35.989
What surface integral will I
get from 3?

00:38:35.989 --> 00:38:39.779
The area vector looks like
this, the electric field looks

00:38:39.779 --> 00:38:42.079
like that, the dot product is 0.
 

00:38:42.079 --> 00:38:44.195
In other words,
the field lines are parallel to

00:38:44.195 --> 00:38:46.539
this face, so they are not going
to penetrate it.

00:38:46.539 --> 00:38:47.969
You're not going to get any
flux.

00:38:47.969 --> 00:38:50.688
Or the area vector is
perpendicular to the field

00:38:50.688 --> 00:38:51.210
vector.
 

00:38:51.210 --> 00:38:53.333
So on this face,
E is 0,

00:38:53.333 --> 00:38:55.670
on the opposite face is also 0.
 

00:38:55.670 --> 00:39:00.349
The same thing goes for 2 and
-2.

00:39:00.349 --> 00:39:03.606
If you go to face number 2
here, the electric field is

00:39:03.606 --> 00:39:06.617
pointing like that,
but there is no flux and there

00:39:06.617 --> 00:39:08.829
is no flux on the opposite face.
 

00:39:08.829 --> 00:39:13.045
So if you get 0,
either because the field is

00:39:13.045 --> 00:39:16.626
parallel to the face,
or if it's perpendicular,

00:39:16.626 --> 00:39:18.690
it has the same value on
opposite faces,

00:39:18.690 --> 00:39:22.001
with opposite pointing normals,
or opposite pointing area

00:39:22.001 --> 00:39:23.420
vectors and you get 0.
 

00:39:23.420 --> 00:39:27.494
That's how you get the surface
integral of E to be 0 on

00:39:27.494 --> 00:39:28.630
this tiny cube.
 

00:39:28.630 --> 00:39:31.400
But if it's 0 on a tiny cube,
it's 0 on anything you can

00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:32.710
build out of tiny cubes.
 

00:39:32.710 --> 00:39:35.880
That means 0 on any surface.
 

00:39:35.880 --> 00:39:38.652
If you repeat the calculation
for B,

00:39:38.652 --> 00:39:42.744
you'll get pretty much the same
logic, except that B now

00:39:42.744 --> 00:39:44.130
points like this.
 

00:39:44.130 --> 00:39:46.427
So on the top face,
B will have no flux

00:39:46.427 --> 00:39:48.369
because it's running along the
face.

00:39:48.369 --> 00:39:49.980
There is no flow through that.
 

00:39:49.980 --> 00:39:51.789
Top and bottom are 0 and 0.
 

00:39:51.789 --> 00:39:55.840
The only faces that matter are
2 and -2, because 2 is coming

00:39:55.840 --> 00:39:59.889
out of the board and B is
coming out of the board.

00:39:59.889 --> 00:40:02.333
But on the other face,
which you cannot see,

00:40:02.333 --> 00:40:05.403
the -2, B is still going
this way, but E,

00:40:05.403 --> 00:40:08.018
the area vector is going the
opposite way.

00:40:08.018 --> 00:40:10.579
The key to this is that
B does not vary.

00:40:10.579 --> 00:40:14.670
You see, if the flux was not
constant,

00:40:14.670 --> 00:40:17.972
if the field was not constant,
the fact that you've got two

00:40:17.972 --> 00:40:21.217
faces with opposite pointing
area vectors doesn't mean the

00:40:21.217 --> 00:40:22.130
answer is 0.
 

00:40:22.130 --> 00:40:23.440
Even though the area vectors
are opposite,

00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:25.619
the field strength would be
bigger on one face,

00:40:25.619 --> 00:40:28.277
smaller on the opposite face,
in which case they won't

00:40:28.277 --> 00:40:28.730
cancel.
 

00:40:28.730 --> 00:40:32.240
But the field is not varying in
the coordinate in which I've

00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:33.610
displaced the planes.
 

00:40:33.610 --> 00:40:39.570
That's the reason you get 0 for
both of those.

00:40:39.570 --> 00:40:41.429
All right.
 

00:40:41.429 --> 00:40:46.619
So far what I've shown you is
that the solution I have

00:40:46.619 --> 00:40:51.809
automatically satisfies 0
surface integral without any

00:40:51.809 --> 00:40:54.159
further assumptions.
 

00:40:54.159 --> 00:40:57.295
Of course, it's very important
that E did not vary with

00:40:57.295 --> 00:40:58.530
x and z.
 

00:40:58.530 --> 00:41:00.699
But with the assumed form,
I don't have to worry.

00:41:00.699 --> 00:41:03.815
I still have to only worry
about the other two Maxwell

00:41:03.815 --> 00:41:05.989
equations involving line
integrals.

00:41:05.989 --> 00:41:09.500
I've got to make sure that
works out.

00:41:09.500 --> 00:41:14.670
So let's see.
 

00:41:14.670 --> 00:41:18.268
So here I have to take loops
and I told you,

00:41:18.268 --> 00:41:21.110
when you take loops now,
you've got to take loops in

00:41:21.110 --> 00:41:23.996
that plane,
that plane, and that plane,

00:41:23.996 --> 00:41:28.831
because it takes three kinds of
little flat Lego pieces to form

00:41:28.831 --> 00:41:30.860
a curved surface in 3D.
 

00:41:30.860 --> 00:41:33.159
So let me take this loop first.
 

00:41:33.159 --> 00:41:41.409
I want to take an infinitesimal
loop that looks like this.

00:41:41.409 --> 00:41:44.603
I choose the orientation of
this so that if I do the right

00:41:44.603 --> 00:41:47.684
hand rule, the area vector is
pointing in the positive y

00:41:47.684 --> 00:41:48.469
direction.
 

00:41:48.469 --> 00:41:52.764
In other words,
this is a tiny loop of size

00:41:52.764 --> 00:41:55.730
Δy--let's see.
 

00:41:55.730 --> 00:42:01.539
Δx this way and
Δz that way.

00:42:01.539 --> 00:42:06.349
The area vector is coming out
like that.

00:42:06.349 --> 00:42:10.737
So I have to now look at the
line integral of

00:42:10.737 --> 00:42:15.324
E⋅dl
and equate it to

00:42:15.324 --> 00:42:21.010
-dΦ
_B /dt.

00:42:21.010 --> 00:42:25.610
I have to see,
is that true or false?

00:42:25.610 --> 00:42:30.686
Well, take this loop and look
at the line integral of E

00:42:30.686 --> 00:42:32.599
and see what happens.
 

00:42:32.599 --> 00:42:36.389
There is an E going up
this face.

00:42:36.389 --> 00:42:38.425
E is perpendicular to
that face , and E is

00:42:38.425 --> 00:42:39.500
perpendicular to that edge.
 

00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:41.500
E is anti-parallel to
this edge.

00:42:41.500 --> 00:42:42.630
You see that?
 

00:42:42.630 --> 00:42:46.829
If E is pointing up,
it cancels between these two.

00:42:46.829 --> 00:42:48.722
These two have no contribution,
because E is

00:42:48.722 --> 00:42:49.820
perpendicular to dl.
 

00:42:49.820 --> 00:42:52.000
But these two cancel.
 

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:54.739
They cancel again because the
E that you have here

00:42:54.739 --> 00:42:57.577
going up is the same E
that you have here also going

00:42:57.577 --> 00:42:59.831
up,
but the dl is going in

00:42:59.831 --> 00:43:01.179
opposite directions.
 

00:43:01.179 --> 00:43:04.648
Therefore
E⋅dl

00:43:04.648 --> 00:43:08.030
around this tiny loop is
actually 0.

00:43:08.030 --> 00:43:09.719
You understand why it is 0?
 

00:43:09.719 --> 00:43:13.393
Cancelation between opposite
edges, and two edges that don't

00:43:13.393 --> 00:43:14.639
give you anything.
 

00:43:14.639 --> 00:43:18.079
So what we hope for is that on
the right hand side,

00:43:18.079 --> 00:43:21.920
there better not be any
magnetic flux coming out of this

00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:24.494
thing,
because otherwise right hand

00:43:24.494 --> 00:43:27.550
side will give you a non-zero
contribution.

00:43:27.550 --> 00:43:29.559
But luckily,
that is the case,

00:43:29.559 --> 00:43:32.679
because the magnetic field
looks like this.

00:43:32.679 --> 00:43:34.820
It's in the plane of this loop.
 

00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:39.827
The dot product of the area
vector, which is perpendicular

00:43:39.827 --> 00:43:45.099
to the loop and the B
field is 0, so that's also 0.

00:43:45.099 --> 00:43:50.268
So this is identically
satisfied on that loop.

00:43:50.268 --> 00:43:52.505
Now if you take line integral
of

00:43:52.505 --> 00:43:56.545
B⋅dl,
and that's supposed to be

00:43:56.545 --> 00:43:59.085
μ_0
ε_0

00:43:59.085 --> 00:44:02.449
dΦ/dt of
the electric flux,

00:44:02.449 --> 00:44:05.179
again, you should try to do the
exercise with me.

00:44:05.179 --> 00:44:07.498
Magnetic field,
I said, is going in the

00:44:07.498 --> 00:44:09.978
x direction,
so it has nothing to do with

00:44:09.978 --> 00:44:12.130
those two edges,
because they are perpendicular

00:44:12.130 --> 00:44:14.902
to it,
but it cancels between these

00:44:14.902 --> 00:44:15.329
two.
 

00:44:15.329 --> 00:44:17.541
It cancels because the edges
are going in the opposite

00:44:17.541 --> 00:44:19.963
direction, but B doesn't
vary from this edge to that

00:44:19.963 --> 00:44:20.340
edge.
 

00:44:20.340 --> 00:44:24.360
It varies only with y,
so again you get 0.

00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:26.851
And there is no electric flux
coming out of this surface,

00:44:26.851 --> 00:44:29.389
because electric field lines
also lie in the plane of that

00:44:29.389 --> 00:44:29.789
loop.
 

00:44:29.789 --> 00:44:31.949
They don't cross it.
 

00:44:31.949 --> 00:44:38.079
So those equations are also
satisfied.

00:44:38.079 --> 00:44:40.630
But I'm not done,
because I still have to

00:44:40.630 --> 00:44:44.139
consider loops in this plane and
loops in that plane.

00:44:44.139 --> 00:44:46.730
So far I've gotten no
conditions at all.

00:44:46.730 --> 00:44:49.733
What this means so far is that
there are no further

00:44:49.733 --> 00:44:53.579
restrictions on E_z
and B_x.

00:44:53.579 --> 00:44:54.969
They can be anything you like.
 

00:44:54.969 --> 00:44:59.277
But I'm going to get
restrictions by finally

00:44:59.277 --> 00:45:05.090
considering loops in this plane
and loops in that plane.

00:45:05.090 --> 00:45:11.940
So let's see how you get
conditions on one of them.

00:45:11.940 --> 00:45:15.190
This is x, y, z.
 

00:45:15.190 --> 00:45:22.780
So let's take a loop that looks
like this.

00:45:22.780 --> 00:45:25.916
I've chosen it so that with the
right hand rule,

00:45:25.916 --> 00:45:29.255
the area vector is
perpendicular and coming out the

00:45:29.255 --> 00:45:29.989
x axis.
 

00:45:29.989 --> 00:45:35.208
I remind you once again,
E looks like that,

00:45:35.208 --> 00:45:38.510
and B looks like this.
 

00:45:38.510 --> 00:45:44.139
So let me give the edges a
name, 1,2, 3,4.

00:45:44.139 --> 00:45:50.244
And let's take the condition
E⋅dl =

00:45:50.244 --> 00:45:54.010
- d/dt of the magnetic
flux.

00:45:54.010 --> 00:45:57.199
Now this loop has dimension
dy in this direction,

00:45:57.199 --> 00:45:58.940
dz in that direction.
 

00:45:58.940 --> 00:46:00.800
This is an infinitesimal loop.
 

00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:04.590
I've drawn it so you can see
it, but it's infinitesimal.

00:46:04.590 --> 00:46:09.860
Okay, so what do I get on the
right hand side?

00:46:09.860 --> 00:46:13.994
Right hand side says
−d/dt of the

00:46:13.994 --> 00:46:17.670
magnetic flux coming out of the
board.

00:46:17.670 --> 00:46:23.469
The magnetic flux is coming out
like this, right?

00:46:23.469 --> 00:46:25.722
It's coming out of the
blackboard, so there really is a

00:46:25.722 --> 00:46:26.389
magnetic flux.
 

00:46:26.389 --> 00:46:30.472
That magnetic flux is the
number I wrote down,

00:46:30.472 --> 00:46:36.369
B_x times the
loop area which is dy/dz.

00:46:36.369 --> 00:46:41.141
That gives me -
ΔyΔz

00:46:41.141 --> 00:46:44.369
B_x dt.
 

00:46:44.369 --> 00:46:49.320
That's the right hand side.
 

00:46:49.320 --> 00:46:53.119
This loop is so tiny,
I am approximating B by

00:46:53.119 --> 00:46:55.949
the value at the center if you
like.

00:46:55.949 --> 00:46:57.344
You might say,
"Look, I don't think

00:46:57.344 --> 00:46:58.670
B is a constant on the
loop.

00:46:58.670 --> 00:47:00.090
B is varying.
 

00:47:00.090 --> 00:47:01.820
Why do you take the value of
the center?"

00:47:01.820 --> 00:47:04.967
Well, if it varies,
the variation is proportional

00:47:04.967 --> 00:47:06.409
to Δx .
 

00:47:06.409 --> 00:47:08.380
I'm to Δy or
Δz,

00:47:08.380 --> 00:47:10.835
therefore that will be a term
proportional to Δy

00:47:10.835 --> 00:47:12.349
squared or Δz
squared.

00:47:12.349 --> 00:47:16.182
But we are going to keep things
to first order in Δy

00:47:16.182 --> 00:47:19.250
and Δz,
so it doesn't matter.

00:47:19.250 --> 00:47:21.550
Now how about the left hand
side?

00:47:21.550 --> 00:47:25.213
If you look at the left hand
side, I hope you'll try to do

00:47:25.213 --> 00:47:25.920
this one.
 

00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:30.170
If you go like that on edge 2,
you will get

00:47:30.170 --> 00:47:35.940
E_z times
Δz --I'm sorry.

00:47:35.940 --> 00:47:39.726
Let me write it as
Δz times

00:47:39.726 --> 00:47:45.650
E_z at the
point y Δy.

00:47:45.650 --> 00:47:50.155
And on this edge,
I will get - Δz

00:47:50.155 --> 00:47:56.199
times E_z
at the point y.

00:47:56.199 --> 00:47:58.396
In other words,
the electric field is

00:47:58.396 --> 00:48:01.018
everywhere, going up,
so it goes up here.

00:48:01.018 --> 00:48:04.802
E is parallel to it,
so that should be that times

00:48:04.802 --> 00:48:06.039
Δz.
 

00:48:06.039 --> 00:48:08.157
These two don't contribute,
because E and

00:48:08.157 --> 00:48:09.643
ΔL are
perpendicular,

00:48:09.643 --> 00:48:10.500
so forget that.
 

00:48:10.500 --> 00:48:12.284
But this one,
it goes in the opposite

00:48:12.284 --> 00:48:14.159
direction,
so I subtract it,

00:48:14.159 --> 00:48:17.920
but I bear in mind that this is
y Δy,

00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:19.889
but that's only y.
 

00:48:19.889 --> 00:48:22.530
So here I hope you guys will
know what to do.

00:48:22.530 --> 00:48:27.172
You will say that is then
roughly equal to

00:48:27.172 --> 00:48:32.719
dE_z/dy times
Δy.

00:48:32.719 --> 00:48:36.422
Therefore the line integral of
the electric field is

00:48:36.422 --> 00:48:40.632
proportional to the derivative
of dz with respect to

00:48:40.632 --> 00:48:43.610
y, times the area of the
loop.

00:48:43.610 --> 00:48:49.373
And the surface integral of the
flux change is also proportional

00:48:49.373 --> 00:48:52.576
to the area of the loop,
and you get

00:48:52.576 --> 00:48:55.230
dB_x/dt.
 

00:48:55.230 --> 00:49:02.376
So this is the final equation
you get by considering that

00:49:02.376 --> 00:49:03.268
loop.
 

00:49:03.268 --> 00:49:07.416
So what is remarkable is the
line integral and the surface

00:49:07.416 --> 00:49:10.690
integral are both proportional
to the area.

00:49:10.690 --> 00:49:13.483
The surface integral being
proportional to the area of the

00:49:13.483 --> 00:49:15.443
loop is obvious,
because it's the surface

00:49:15.443 --> 00:49:16.079
integral.
 

00:49:16.079 --> 00:49:18.480
Why is the line integral
proportional to the area?

00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:22.092
Because one part of the line
integral is the width of the

00:49:22.092 --> 00:49:23.498
loop,
Δz,

00:49:23.498 --> 00:49:26.612
other one comes in because the
extent to which they don't

00:49:26.612 --> 00:49:30.005
cancel is due to the derivative
of the field in the transverse

00:49:30.005 --> 00:49:30.840
direction.
 

00:49:30.840 --> 00:49:33.079
That brings you a
Δy.

00:49:33.079 --> 00:49:35.864
So if you cancel all of this,
you get the equation that I'm

00:49:35.864 --> 00:49:43.936
interested in,
which is very important -

00:49:43.936 --> 00:49:59.610
dE_z/dy =
-dB_x/dt.

00:49:59.610 --> 00:50:03.489
This came from looking at this
equation.

00:50:03.489 --> 00:50:06.083
The last one,
another loop equation,

00:50:06.083 --> 00:50:09.045
I'm going to go through
somewhat quickly,

00:50:09.045 --> 00:50:11.639
because it's going to be 0 = 0.
 

00:50:11.639 --> 00:50:15.965
Suppose I take the integral of
the magnetic field around this

00:50:15.965 --> 00:50:16.469
loop.
 

00:50:16.469 --> 00:50:18.510
Do you understand why it is 0?
 

00:50:18.510 --> 00:50:20.920
The magnetic field is coming
out of the blackboard.

00:50:20.920 --> 00:50:26.476
dl's are all lying in
the plane, so line integral of

00:50:26.476 --> 00:50:28.489
B is then 0.
 

00:50:28.489 --> 00:50:30.987
And that better be equal to
-μ_0

00:50:30.987 --> 00:50:33.007
ε_0
dΦ

00:50:33.007 --> 00:50:35.239
_electric
/dt.

00:50:35.239 --> 00:50:37.382
That is the case,
because there is no electric

00:50:37.382 --> 00:50:38.860
flux coming out of this face.
 

00:50:38.860 --> 00:50:40.739
The electric lines are in the
plane of the loop.

00:50:40.739 --> 00:50:43.657
There is no electric flux,
there is no rate of change,

00:50:43.657 --> 00:50:44.539
so it's 0 = 0.
 

00:50:44.539 --> 00:50:49.255
So from this loop,
I've managed to get one

00:50:49.255 --> 00:50:50.518
equation.
 

00:50:50.518 --> 00:50:53.425
So my plan now is,
I don't want to do yet another

00:50:53.425 --> 00:50:56.996
loop, because you've got the
idea, or it's not going to help

00:50:56.996 --> 00:50:58.570
to draw one more loop.
 

00:50:58.570 --> 00:51:03.289
But I would just say that if
you draw the last loop,

00:51:03.289 --> 00:51:05.789
which lies in what plane?
 

00:51:05.789 --> 00:51:10.440
Which lies in this plane.
 

00:51:10.440 --> 00:51:11.409
You will get one more equation.
 

00:51:11.409 --> 00:51:14.739
I'm just going to tell you what
it is.

00:51:14.739 --> 00:51:33.579
I got dE_z/dy
is -dB_x/dt.

00:51:33.579 --> 00:51:38.826
You'll get another equation,
dB_x/dy = -

00:51:38.826 --> 00:51:42.760
μ_0ε
_0dE

00:51:42.760 --> 00:51:45.010
_z/dt.
 

00:51:45.010 --> 00:51:47.485
So I confess,
that I've not derived this one,

00:51:47.485 --> 00:51:50.916
but it's going to involve just
drawing one more loop and doing

00:51:50.916 --> 00:51:51.309
it.
 

00:51:51.309 --> 00:51:54.275
Now it's really up to you guys
how much you want to do this,

00:51:54.275 --> 00:51:56.940
but you should at least have
some idea what we did.

00:51:56.940 --> 00:52:02.849
It turns out these are the only
restrictions I have to satisfy.

00:52:02.849 --> 00:52:07.338
If this is true of my field,
I'm done, because I've

00:52:07.338 --> 00:52:10.480
satisfied every Maxwell
equation.

00:52:10.480 --> 00:52:13.831
Every surface integral was 0 on
every tiny cube and therefore 0

00:52:13.831 --> 00:52:15.940
everywhere for E and
B.

00:52:15.940 --> 00:52:18.460
The line integrals,
some were identically

00:52:18.460 --> 00:52:20.289
satisfied, some were 0 = 0.
 

00:52:20.289 --> 00:52:24.847
There were some that led to non
trivial conditions and it's

00:52:24.847 --> 00:52:25.789
these two.
 

00:52:25.789 --> 00:52:28.420
Therefore I'm told that if the
fields that I pick,

00:52:28.420 --> 00:52:31.867
that depend on y and t,
have the property that the y

00:52:31.867 --> 00:52:35.789
derivative of this guy is the t
derivative of that guy,

00:52:35.789 --> 00:52:37.695
and the y derivative of
B_x is up to

00:52:37.695 --> 00:52:39.827
some constant,
the -t derivative of the other

00:52:39.827 --> 00:52:41.340
guy,
you're done.

00:52:41.340 --> 00:52:45.010
That's all you require of that
function.

00:52:45.010 --> 00:52:48.925
So let's do the following -
take this equation,

00:52:48.925 --> 00:52:52.159
take its y derivative on both
sides.

00:52:52.159 --> 00:52:54.737
IN other words,
I want to take y derivative of

00:52:54.737 --> 00:52:57.429
this and I want to take y
derivative of that.

00:52:57.429 --> 00:53:05.826
Then here you will get
d^(2)E _z/dy

00:53:05.826 --> 00:53:13.329
^(2) = -dB_x/dy
dt.

00:53:13.329 --> 00:53:15.518
Take the d/dz of this.
 

00:53:15.518 --> 00:53:19.094
Now you know partial
derivatives, you can take the

00:53:19.094 --> 00:53:23.034
derivatives in any order you
like, so let's write it as

00:53:23.034 --> 00:53:25.150
d/dt, d/dy.
 

00:53:25.150 --> 00:53:28.507
But dB_x/dy is
μ_0dE

00:53:28.507 --> 00:53:29.929
_z/dt.
 

00:53:29.929 --> 00:53:37.440
Another dt makes it
μ_0ε

00:53:37.440 --> 00:53:43.699
_0d^(2)E
_z/dt^(2).

00:53:43.699 --> 00:53:47.074
Take first the y derivative,
dB_x/dy,

00:53:47.074 --> 00:53:49.429
is that one single time
derivative.

00:53:49.429 --> 00:53:52.289
Take one more time derivative,
you get this.

00:53:52.289 --> 00:53:55.706
Now we get this wonderful--we
really have the wave equation

00:53:55.706 --> 00:53:58.844
now,
because I get d^(2)E

00:53:58.844 --> 00:54:05.239
_z/dy ^(2) -
μ_0ε

00:54:05.239 --> 00:54:11.280
_0d^(2)E
_z/dt^(2) = 0,

00:54:11.280 --> 00:54:17.500
which you recognize to be the
wave equation.

00:54:17.500 --> 00:54:22.817
That's what the wave equation
looks like in the top of the

00:54:22.817 --> 00:54:24.030
blackboard.
 

00:54:24.030 --> 00:54:27.335
But the things that are
oscillating now are not some

00:54:27.335 --> 00:54:27.920
string.
 

00:54:27.920 --> 00:54:31.909
It is really the electric field
oscillating.

00:54:31.909 --> 00:54:33.829
It's not a medium that's
oscillating.

00:54:33.829 --> 00:54:34.679
There's nothing there.
 

00:54:34.679 --> 00:54:37.110
This is all in vacuum.
 

00:54:37.110 --> 00:54:39.820
So let's find the velocity.
 

00:54:39.820 --> 00:54:47.280
v^(2) will be
1/μ_0ε

00:54:47.280 --> 00:54:51.159
_0,
right?

00:54:51.159 --> 00:54:57.166
Because this thing that comes
with our equation is the

00:54:57.166 --> 00:54:59.659
1/v^(2) term.
 

00:54:59.659 --> 00:55:01.813
Then you go back to your
electrostatics and

00:55:01.813 --> 00:55:04.530
magnetostatics and find out what
these numbers are.

00:55:04.530 --> 00:55:09.431
And I remind you that
¼Πε

00:55:09.431 --> 00:55:13.027
_0 is 9�10^(9)
and

00:55:13.027 --> 00:55:17.929
μ_0/4Π is
10^(-7).

00:55:17.929 --> 00:55:21.735
So let's write this as
4Π/μ_0

00:55:21.735 --> 00:55:25.539
times ¼Πε
_0,

00:55:25.539 --> 00:55:27.969
because we know what those guys
are.

00:55:27.969 --> 00:55:32.739
¼Πε
_0 is 9ï¿½10^(9).

00:55:32.739 --> 00:55:37.081
And 4Π/μ
_0_ is

00:55:37.081 --> 00:55:40.130
10^(7), so you get 9�10^(16).
 

00:55:40.130 --> 00:55:49.239
Or the velocity is 3�10^(8)
meters per second.

00:55:49.239 --> 00:55:53.963
So this was the big moment in
physics, when you suddenly

00:55:53.963 --> 00:55:59.030
realize that these things are
propagating at the velocity of

00:55:59.030 --> 00:55:59.889
light.
 

00:55:59.889 --> 00:56:02.550
So people knew the velocity of
light from other measurements.

00:56:02.550 --> 00:56:04.480
They had a fairly good idea
what it was.

00:56:04.480 --> 00:56:07.510
They know μ_0 by
doing experiments with currents.

00:56:07.510 --> 00:56:10.110
They knew ε_0
from Coulomb's law.

00:56:10.110 --> 00:56:13.119
It's one of the greatest
syntheses that you put them

00:56:13.119 --> 00:56:15.480
together and out comes an
explanation.

00:56:15.480 --> 00:56:19.159
Now this doesn't mean that
electromagnetic waves are the

00:56:19.159 --> 00:56:20.230
same as light.
 

00:56:20.230 --> 00:56:23.617
You agree that if you run next
to a buffalo at the same speed,

00:56:23.617 --> 00:56:24.949
you are not a buffalo.
 

00:56:24.949 --> 00:56:27.409
You just happen to have the
same speed.

00:56:27.409 --> 00:56:30.860
So that was a bit of a leap to
say it is really light.

00:56:30.860 --> 00:56:33.690
But it was also known that
whenever you have sparks in

00:56:33.690 --> 00:56:36.199
electrical circuits and so on,
you see light.

00:56:36.199 --> 00:56:38.784
So it took a little more than
that, but it's quite amazing,

00:56:38.784 --> 00:56:41.369
because gravity waves also
travel at the speed of light.

00:56:41.369 --> 00:56:44.179
You cannot assume that the
speed means the same phenomenon.

00:56:44.179 --> 00:56:45.670
But they were really right this
time.

00:56:45.670 --> 00:56:48.760
It really was the speed of
light.

00:56:48.760 --> 00:56:52.150
So we now have a new
understanding of what light it.

00:56:52.150 --> 00:56:57.119
Light is simply electromagnetic
waves traveling at the speed.

00:56:57.119 --> 00:57:01.559
It consists of electric and
magnetic fields.

00:57:01.559 --> 00:57:06.059
What we have is an example of a
simple wave,

00:57:06.059 --> 00:57:08.983
but one can show in general
that if you took the most

00:57:08.983 --> 00:57:11.570
general E and B
you can have,

00:57:11.570 --> 00:57:14.010
you will get similar wave
equations.

00:57:14.010 --> 00:57:17.090
You will get it for every
component of E and every

00:57:17.090 --> 00:57:18.409
component of B.
 

00:57:18.409 --> 00:57:21.880
So waves in three dimensions
will satisfy the general wave

00:57:21.880 --> 00:57:22.550
equation.
 

00:57:22.550 --> 00:57:25.532
But I'm not interested in the
most general case,

00:57:25.532 --> 00:57:29.659
because this is enough to show
you where everything comes from.

00:57:29.659 --> 00:57:31.840
So you have to think about how
wonderful this is,

00:57:31.840 --> 00:57:34.400
because you do experiments with
charges,

00:57:34.400 --> 00:57:36.690
with currents,
and you describe the

00:57:36.690 --> 00:57:39.050
phenomenology as best as you
can.

00:57:39.050 --> 00:57:45.440
Then Maxwell added that extra
term from logical consistency,

00:57:45.440 --> 00:57:47.889
by taking this capacitor and
drawing different surfaces,

00:57:47.889 --> 00:57:51.309
and realizing that unless you
added the second term,

00:57:51.309 --> 00:57:52.989
dΦ
_E /dt

00:57:52.989 --> 00:57:53.559
it didn't work.
 

00:57:53.559 --> 00:57:56.780
And without the second term,
you don't get the wave.

00:57:56.780 --> 00:58:00.773
It's only by adding the second
term and then fiddling with

00:58:00.773 --> 00:58:04.980
equations, he was able to
determine that waves can travel.

00:58:04.980 --> 00:58:08.010
So the reason that
electromagnetic waves travel in

00:58:08.010 --> 00:58:10.983
space without any charges is,
once you've got an E

00:58:10.983 --> 00:58:12.309
field or B field
somewhere,

00:58:12.309 --> 00:58:15.050
it cannot just disappear.
 

00:58:15.050 --> 00:58:16.610
It's like the LC circuit.
 

00:58:16.610 --> 00:58:20.215
If your capacitor is charged,
by the time it discharges,

00:58:20.215 --> 00:58:22.969
it has driven a current in the
inductor.

00:58:22.969 --> 00:58:25.480
Inductor is like a mass and
it's moving with velocity.

00:58:25.480 --> 00:58:28.099
Current is like velocity,
so it won't stop.

00:58:28.099 --> 00:58:30.865
So the current keeps going till
it charges the capacitor the

00:58:30.865 --> 00:58:31.570
opposite way.
 

00:58:31.570 --> 00:58:33.849
Then they go back and forth.
 

00:58:33.849 --> 00:58:36.485
They are the only 1 degree of
freedom, which is the charge in

00:58:36.485 --> 00:58:39.340
the capacitor or the current in
the circuit, which are related.

00:58:39.340 --> 00:58:42.579
Here E and B are
variables defined everywhere,

00:58:42.579 --> 00:58:45.710
but you cannot kill E
because the minute you try to

00:58:45.710 --> 00:58:49.070
destroy E,
you will produce a B.

00:58:49.070 --> 00:58:53.132
The minute you try to destroy
B, you'll produce an

00:58:53.132 --> 00:58:57.123
E, so they keep on
swapping energy and going back

00:58:57.123 --> 00:58:58.139
and forth.
 

00:58:58.139 --> 00:59:02.335
So it is self sustaining and
it's an oscillation if you like,

00:59:02.335 --> 00:59:05.202
but it's an oscillation over
all of space,

00:59:05.202 --> 00:59:08.210
and not over 1 or 2 degrees of
freedom.

00:59:08.210 --> 00:59:13.750
So I'm going to now write down
a specific form.

00:59:13.750 --> 00:59:20.452
The specific form I'm going to
write down looks like E = k

00:59:20.452 --> 00:59:23.039
times E_0.
 

00:59:23.039 --> 00:59:28.213
Now I'm going to pick a
particular function,

00:59:28.213 --> 00:59:33.626
ky - ωt,
and I'm going to take B to be I

00:59:33.626 --> 00:59:38.800
times B_0 sine ky -
ωt.

00:59:38.800 --> 00:59:45.639
Now I'm making a very special
function of y and t.

00:59:45.639 --> 00:59:47.829
Till now, I just said it's a
function of y and t.

00:59:47.829 --> 00:59:49.440
All I needed was it's a
function of y and t.

00:59:49.440 --> 00:59:51.900
That was enough to get me all
this.

00:59:51.900 --> 00:59:55.079
I'm going to find a relation
between these constants,

00:59:55.079 --> 00:59:57.090
E_0 and
B_0,

00:59:57.090 --> 01:00:02.619
by putting them into these two
Maxwell equations I had.

01:00:02.619 --> 01:00:04.800
That's all I want to do now.
 

01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:12.510
So one condition I had was
dE_z/dy was

01:00:12.510 --> 01:00:16.510
-dB_x/dt.
 

01:00:16.510 --> 01:00:20.110
Then I had
dB_x/dy is

01:00:20.110 --> 01:00:24.293
-μ_0ε
_0dE

01:00:24.293 --> 01:00:26.630
_z/dt.
 

01:00:26.630 --> 01:00:31.110
These are the two equations.
 

01:00:31.110 --> 01:00:35.744
I'm going to demand that these
particular functions obey these

01:00:35.744 --> 01:00:36.960
two equations.
 

01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:39.612
If they obey these two
equations, they will obey the

01:00:39.612 --> 01:00:41.744
wave equation,
because when I combine this

01:00:41.744 --> 01:00:44.239
equation with that,
I got the wave equation.

01:00:44.239 --> 01:00:45.329
Do you understand?
 

01:00:45.329 --> 01:00:48.726
I have an equation A and an
equation B, if I put one into

01:00:48.726 --> 01:00:50.969
the other, I got the wave
equation.

01:00:50.969 --> 01:00:53.746
But you really should satisfy
separately equation A and

01:00:53.746 --> 01:00:56.677
equation B, because it's not
enough to satisfy the one you

01:00:56.677 --> 01:00:58.530
get by shoving one in the other.
 

01:00:58.530 --> 01:01:00.480
They should be true
independently.

01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:06.730
So let's demand that this be
true and demand that be true.

01:01:06.730 --> 01:01:09.460
So what is
dE_z/dy?

01:01:09.460 --> 01:01:13.402
If I take the d/dy of
this, this is what I call

01:01:13.402 --> 01:01:16.219
E_z and this is
what I call

01:01:16.219 --> 01:01:17.980
B_x.
 

01:01:17.980 --> 01:01:20.423
dE_z/dy,
if you take the d/dy of

01:01:20.423 --> 01:01:22.425
that,
will give me

01:01:22.425 --> 01:01:29.009
kE_0cos(ky -
ωt). And we want that

01:01:29.009 --> 01:01:33.070
to be =
-dB_x/dt.

01:01:33.070 --> 01:01:35.409
So take the d/dt of this
guy.

01:01:35.409 --> 01:01:40.518
d/dt of this guy is
B_0 -

01:01:40.518 --> 01:01:44.989
ωcos(ky -
ωt).

01:01:44.989 --> 01:01:47.954
So these things cancel out,
then I get

01:01:47.954 --> 01:01:50.360
B_0ω.
 

01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:57.530
So this tells you that
E_0 = ω/k

01:01:57.530 --> 01:02:00.400
B_0.
 

01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:03.217
It tells you about the
magnitude of the E and

01:02:03.217 --> 01:02:05.757
B vectors,
what size they should bear in

01:02:05.757 --> 01:02:07.250
relation to each other.
 

01:02:07.250 --> 01:02:09.980
This is one condition.
 

01:02:09.980 --> 01:02:11.170
I'm almost done.
 

01:02:11.170 --> 01:02:16.650
So I want to take this
condition now.

01:02:16.650 --> 01:02:21.760
So dB_x/dy,
what is that equal to?

01:02:21.760 --> 01:02:27.112
B_0kcos(ky
- ωt) = -

01:02:27.112 --> 01:02:31.481
μ_0
ε_0

01:02:31.481 --> 01:02:37.380
dE_z/dt which will
be - ωE_0

01:02:37.380 --> 01:02:41.969
cos(ky -
ωt).

01:02:41.969 --> 01:02:44.864
Cosines cancel,
then I get a condition

01:02:44.864 --> 01:02:48.856
B_0k =
μ_0ε

01:02:48.856 --> 01:02:53.159
_0ω
times E_0.

01:02:53.159 --> 01:02:57.724
But that equals ω/c
squared times

01:02:57.724 --> 01:03:01.018
E_0,
because μ_0

01:03:01.018 --> 01:03:02.449
ε_0 is
1/c^(2).

01:03:02.449 --> 01:03:06.342
So I get a second condition
which I can write as

01:03:06.342 --> 01:03:10.402
E_0 =
c^(2)/ω

01:03:10.402 --> 01:03:12.969
times B_0.
 

01:03:12.969 --> 01:03:17.389
So these are the two conditions
in the end.

01:03:17.389 --> 01:03:20.320
If you want the function to
look like this traveling wave,

01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:24.097
with sine waves in it,
then the amplitude for E

01:03:24.097 --> 01:03:28.019
and the amplitude for B
have to satisfy these two

01:03:28.019 --> 01:03:29.090
conditions.
 

01:03:29.090 --> 01:03:31.380
But look at these two equations.
 

01:03:31.380 --> 01:03:32.800
They're both telling you
something about

01:03:32.800 --> 01:03:33.639
E_0.
 

01:03:33.639 --> 01:03:35.782
One says E_0
should be ω/k times

01:03:35.782 --> 01:03:36.590
B_0.
 

01:03:36.590 --> 01:03:38.041
The other says
E_0 should be

01:03:38.041 --> 01:03:39.690
c^(2)/ω times
B_0.

01:03:39.690 --> 01:03:44.717
That means ω/k
better equal c^(2)--I

01:03:44.717 --> 01:03:48.099
bet I dropped a k
somewhere.

01:03:48.099 --> 01:03:50.630
Student: You had
B_0k in the--

01:03:50.630 --> 01:03:52.880
Prof: Thank you, yes.
 

01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:59.920
So c^(2)k/ω.
 

01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:05.431
That tells me that
ω^(2)=

01:04:05.431 --> 01:04:11.110
k^(2)c^(2)ω
= kc or -.

01:04:11.110 --> 01:04:12.679
Or if you like,
k is

01:04:12.679 --> 01:04:14.010
ï¿½ω/c.
 

01:04:14.010 --> 01:04:17.291
It doesn't matter how you write
it, but you can see what that

01:04:17.291 --> 01:04:17.730
means.
 

01:04:17.730 --> 01:04:25.168
What this is telling you is
that if you take the function

01:04:25.168 --> 01:04:31.929
sine ky - ωt,
and if ω = kc,

01:04:31.929 --> 01:04:39.190
it becomes sine of ky -
kct.

01:04:39.190 --> 01:04:45.523
That becomes sine of k
times y - ct which is a

01:04:45.523 --> 01:04:48.530
function of y - ct.
 

01:04:48.530 --> 01:04:51.425
In other words,
we knew this was going to

01:04:51.425 --> 01:04:54.335
happen,
because the wave equation says

01:04:54.335 --> 01:04:58.344
the function should be a
function only of y - ct.

01:04:58.344 --> 01:05:01.480
That will happen if ω
= kc.

01:05:01.480 --> 01:05:02.010
You see that?
 

01:05:02.010 --> 01:05:04.342
If ω
= kc, you pull the k

01:05:04.342 --> 01:05:05.880
out, you get y - ct.
 

01:05:05.880 --> 01:05:10.500
Or you can have y ct,
but my solution was y -

01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:11.269
ct.
 

01:05:11.269 --> 01:05:12.110
I'm almost done.
 

01:05:12.110 --> 01:05:15.518
So the last thing I want to get
from this same equation,

01:05:15.518 --> 01:05:18.987
now that that condition is
satisfied, if ω =

01:05:18.987 --> 01:05:23.373
kc, I get
E_0 = c

01:05:23.373 --> 01:05:26.159
times B_0.
 

01:05:26.159 --> 01:05:27.610
So now I'm going to summarize
this.

01:05:27.610 --> 01:05:29.159
Don't worry about the details.
 

01:05:29.159 --> 01:05:35.210
I will tell you the part you
should know all the time.

01:05:35.210 --> 01:05:37.768
So I know this is somewhat
heavy.

01:05:37.768 --> 01:05:41.099
I had to do this calculation at
home to make sure I got all the

01:05:41.099 --> 01:05:41.960
- signs right.
 

01:05:41.960 --> 01:05:43.750
There's an orgy of - signs.
 

01:05:43.750 --> 01:05:45.250
I'm not that interested in that.
 

01:05:45.250 --> 01:05:48.072
I know that you guys,
unless you're going to major in

01:05:48.072 --> 01:05:51.490
physics and want to do it for a
lifetime, don't want to know all

01:05:51.490 --> 01:05:51.980
that.
 

01:05:51.980 --> 01:05:54.250
So what should you know?
 

01:05:54.250 --> 01:05:57.166
What you should know is that by
doing a few experiments,

01:05:57.166 --> 01:05:59.340
one wrote down these Maxwell
equations.

01:05:59.340 --> 01:06:02.302
You've got to understand a
little bit where everything came

01:06:02.302 --> 01:06:02.659
from.
 

01:06:02.659 --> 01:06:06.246
Then the whole class was
demonstrating that they implied

01:06:06.246 --> 01:06:10.159
some waves and the demonstration
was shown for proving it for

01:06:10.159 --> 01:06:13.487
infinitesimal loops and
infinitesimal cubes and then

01:06:13.487 --> 01:06:15.768
seeing what conditions I had.
 

01:06:15.768 --> 01:06:19.722
And I found that I could get a
set of functions that are

01:06:19.722 --> 01:06:23.387
dependent on y and t,
and that they really travel at

01:06:23.387 --> 01:06:25.039
the speed of light.
 

01:06:25.039 --> 01:06:26.260
So that was the bottom line.
 

01:06:26.260 --> 01:06:29.179
Actual derivatives and how
everything happened is really

01:06:29.179 --> 01:06:31.730
not something I expect you to
carry in your head,

01:06:31.730 --> 01:06:34.119
so don't let the exams ruin
that for you.

01:06:34.119 --> 01:06:35.090
I don't care.
 

01:06:35.090 --> 01:06:40.070
I will not quiz you on that
part of this derivation.

01:06:40.070 --> 01:06:43.139
But you must understand that
the structure of physics was

01:06:43.139 --> 01:06:46.264
such that it was an interplay
between some experiments and

01:06:46.264 --> 01:06:48.952
some purely theoretical
reasoning on the nature of

01:06:48.952 --> 01:06:49.829
equations.
 

01:06:49.829 --> 01:06:54.021
And you put them together and
what makes it worthwhile in the

01:06:54.021 --> 01:06:57.865
end is to get fantastic
productions like this that unify

01:06:57.865 --> 01:07:01.639
electricity and magnetism and
light into one shot.

01:07:01.639 --> 01:07:04.559
So the picture I get now,
if you look at all of this,

01:07:04.559 --> 01:07:10.791
the final answer is E
looks like k times some

01:07:10.791 --> 01:07:17.559
number E_0 sine
ky - ωt.

01:07:17.559 --> 01:07:22.730
But I want you to know that
ω = kc there.

01:07:22.730 --> 01:07:27.367
Then I get B =
IB_0

01:07:27.367 --> 01:07:31.534
also the same sine,
with the extra restriction that

01:07:31.534 --> 01:07:35.570
B_0 times
c = E_0.

01:07:35.570 --> 01:07:40.050
So here is what the
electromagnetic wave looks like.

01:07:40.050 --> 01:07:45.110
One guy, the electric field,
is always living in this plane.

01:07:45.110 --> 01:07:46.880
This is the E field.
 

01:07:46.880 --> 01:07:49.016
At one instant,
if you take a snapshot,

01:07:49.016 --> 01:07:51.489
that's what it will be doing,
going up there,

01:07:51.489 --> 01:07:53.570
coming down here,
going up there.

01:07:53.570 --> 01:07:56.179
That's E.
 

01:07:56.179 --> 01:08:04.626
B field looks like this,
lies horizontal here,

01:08:04.626 --> 01:08:09.500
goes like hat and comes out.
 

01:08:09.500 --> 01:08:13.469
So this is in that plane and
that is in the vertical plane.

01:08:13.469 --> 01:08:17.170
That's horizontal plane,
that's the vertical plane.

01:08:17.170 --> 01:08:20.118
So that is E and this is
B.

01:08:20.118 --> 01:08:23.707
And the point is,
E over B =

01:08:23.707 --> 01:08:24.670
C.
 

01:08:24.670 --> 01:08:27.408
In other words,
E is much bigger than

01:08:27.408 --> 01:08:28.109
B.
 

01:08:28.109 --> 01:08:32.319
The ratio of them is the
velocity of light.

01:08:32.319 --> 01:08:35.436
This is interesting,
because if you took the force

01:08:35.436 --> 01:08:39.255
on a charge, you remember is
q times E v

01:08:39.255 --> 01:08:40.210
x B.
 

01:08:40.210 --> 01:08:43.585
That means if you took an
electron and you left it in the

01:08:43.585 --> 01:08:46.840
electromagnetic field,
the field comes and hits you.

01:08:46.840 --> 01:08:48.657
If E field is
oscillating one way,

01:08:48.657 --> 01:08:51.020
the B field is
oscillating perpendicularly.

01:08:51.020 --> 01:08:54.279
The wave is traveling in a
direction perpendicular to both.

01:08:54.279 --> 01:08:55.912
If you want,
it's in the direction of

01:08:55.912 --> 01:08:58.224
E x B,
is the direction of propagation

01:08:58.224 --> 01:08:58.948
of the wave.
 

01:08:58.948 --> 01:09:01.872
If it hits an electron there,
the oscillating up and down

01:09:01.872 --> 01:09:04.850
electric field will make the
electron move up and down.

01:09:04.850 --> 01:09:07.359
It will also be feeling a
magnetic force,

01:09:07.359 --> 01:09:08.738
V x B.
 

01:09:08.738 --> 01:09:12.134
But notice that the size of
B is the size of E

01:09:12.134 --> 01:09:13.399
divided by c.
 

01:09:13.399 --> 01:09:16.721
So the electric force to
magnetic force ratio,

01:09:16.721 --> 01:09:20.710
or magnetic electric will be
the ratio of v over

01:09:20.710 --> 01:09:21.670
c.
 

01:09:21.670 --> 01:09:24.359
So for most velocities,
for electrons and circuits and

01:09:24.359 --> 01:09:27.101
so on, the velocity is much
tinier than the velocity of

01:09:27.101 --> 01:09:27.609
light.
 

01:09:27.609 --> 01:09:29.670
So when a radio wave hits your
antenna,

01:09:29.670 --> 01:09:32.560
gets the electric charges in
action,

01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:34.819
it's the electric field that
does most of the forcing,

01:09:34.819 --> 01:09:37.078
not the magnetic field.
 

01:09:37.078 --> 01:09:38.960
But in astrophysics and cosmic
ray physics,

01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:42.287
where particles can travel at
velocities comparable to that of

01:09:42.287 --> 01:09:44.978
light,
then these forces can become

01:09:44.978 --> 01:09:45.920
comparable.
 

01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:51.000

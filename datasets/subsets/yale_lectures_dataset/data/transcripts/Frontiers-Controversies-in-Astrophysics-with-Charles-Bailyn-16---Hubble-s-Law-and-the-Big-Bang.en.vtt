00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.484
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Welcome to part

00:00:02.484 --> 00:00:05.071
three of the course.
This is going to be about

00:00:05.071 --> 00:00:07.867
cosmology.
One of the most amazing things

00:00:07.867 --> 00:00:11.695
that's happened over the past
half century or so is that

00:00:11.695 --> 00:00:14.736
cosmology,
which is the study of the

00:00:14.736 --> 00:00:18.410
Universe as a whole,
has become a scientific

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:21.346
subject,
and something that one can say

00:00:21.346 --> 00:00:24.939
something about in scientific
terms, rather than merely

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:27.755
philosophical terms.
In recent years,

00:00:27.755 --> 00:00:31.931
in the past ten years or so,
there has been kind of a

00:00:31.931 --> 00:00:36.323
revolution in cosmology,
which has come about because of

00:00:36.323 --> 00:00:40.556
the discovery that the vast
majority of the Universe is made

00:00:40.556 --> 00:00:44.000
out of stuff that we have no
idea what it is.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.070
So, the discovery is,
we have no idea what the

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.396
Universe is made of.
And that actually,

00:00:51.396 --> 00:00:54.070
you know, it doesn't sound so
good.

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.153
It sounds like this is a big
failure of science,

00:00:57.153 --> 00:00:59.055
somehow.
But scientists are clever,

00:00:59.055 --> 00:01:03.053
so we describe it differently.
What we claim is that what has

00:01:03.053 --> 00:01:07.160
happened is that we have
discovered dark energy.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.260
Dark energy, what is that?
We don't have a clue,

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.482
but it's most of the Universe.
And we've discovered that it

00:01:15.482 --> 00:01:17.744
exists.
So, that's kind of where we are

00:01:17.744 --> 00:01:20.391
right now.
What I want to do over the next

00:01:20.391 --> 00:01:23.848
four or five weeks is talk about
the discovery of dark

00:01:23.848 --> 00:01:28.257
energy--how that was done.
And now that we know that it's

00:01:28.257 --> 00:01:33.376
there, but we don't what it is,
what people intend to do about

00:01:33.376 --> 00:01:34.928
it.
And this is,

00:01:34.928 --> 00:01:38.074
I should say,
only a relatively small

00:01:38.074 --> 00:01:43.217
fraction of modern cosmology.
If you want to know about many

00:01:43.217 --> 00:01:47.989
of the other interesting things
that are going in cosmology,

00:01:47.989 --> 00:01:51.072
you have to take a whole
course, or several courses,

00:01:51.072 --> 00:01:53.470
on this topic.
Such courses exist.

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:59.311
I recommend Astro 170 or 220 if
you find yourself interested in

00:01:59.311 --> 00:02:02.158
this kind of thing.
But nevertheless,

00:02:02.158 --> 00:02:03.895
this one particular
discovery--and,

00:02:03.895 --> 00:02:06.807
in fact, what I'm going to be
focusing on is not just dark

00:02:06.807 --> 00:02:09.845
energy,
but one particular way that

00:02:09.845 --> 00:02:14.003
dark energy--the first way.
There are now other indications

00:02:14.003 --> 00:02:16.399
that exist.
One particular way in which

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:20.482
dark energy has been discovered.
And so, it's a fairly narrow

00:02:20.482 --> 00:02:24.692
focus that I'll be taking here,
but that will enable us to get

00:02:24.692 --> 00:02:28.349
into some depth about how this
discovery was made.

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:33.210
So, let me let you in on the
secret before we even begin.

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:36.170
Dark energy is something that
you can't see.

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.520
That's sort of its name.
We've done this twice already,

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.027
right?
We've discovered planets around

00:02:43.027 --> 00:02:45.980
other stars--that you couldn't
see the planets.

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.966
How do you do that?
You look at the star--the

00:02:47.966 --> 00:02:50.371
motion of the star.
We've discovered the existence

00:02:50.371 --> 00:02:52.790
of black holes which,
of course, you can't see.

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.126
How do you do that?
You look at the motion of some

00:02:56.126 --> 00:03:00.000
star that is influenced by the
existence of the black hole.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.319
So, what are we going to do
about dark energy?

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:04.560
Well, this isn't hard to
extrapolate.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.546
What we're going to do is we're
going to look at the motion of

00:03:08.546 --> 00:03:12.011
things that we can see,
and infer the presence of dark

00:03:12.011 --> 00:03:13.286
energy.
And of course,

00:03:13.286 --> 00:03:15.759
how do we look at the motion?
We look at Doppler shifts.

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:18.169
That will be another recurring
theme.

00:03:18.169 --> 00:03:22.700
And so, the plan of action here
is actually not so different

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.770
from something we've done a
couple of times before,

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:30.250
although the context and the
implications,

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.900
and the particular details,
needless to say,

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.500
are.
Okay.

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:41.312
So, let's go back in time
almost ninety years,

00:03:41.312 --> 00:03:43.250
back to 1920.

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:50.395
So, supposing one were to give
a course in Frontiers and

00:03:50.395 --> 00:03:54.069
Controversies in Astrophysics in
the year 1920.

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:56.650
What would one have been
talking about?

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.717
Frontiers and Controversies.
The big issue,

00:04:01.717 --> 00:04:07.224
at least in terms of cosmology,
was the question of the

00:04:07.224 --> 00:04:10.080
so-called spiral nebulae.

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:17.169
These had been discovered over
the previous few decades after

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:20.837
the invention of photography,
allowed pictures of the sky to

00:04:20.837 --> 00:04:23.569
be created.
And as people took pictures of

00:04:23.569 --> 00:04:27.170
the sky, what they discovered
was, scattered all over the sky

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:31.819
are these little spiral clouds,
the so-called spiral nebulae.

00:04:31.819 --> 00:04:33.690
What are these things,
they wondered.

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.500
And, in particular,
where are these things?

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.319
And there were two basic
hypotheses.

00:04:39.319 --> 00:04:45.680
One was that these are,
sort of, clouds--shining clouds

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.590
of gas.
These were known to exist in

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:54.748
other kinds of shapes.
So, these are clouds of some

00:04:54.748 --> 00:05:02.866
kind of glowing gas,
and that they are part of our

00:05:02.866 --> 00:05:07.735
so-called galaxy.
Galaxy comes from the Greek

00:05:07.735 --> 00:05:10.691
word for milk.
It's basically Greek for Milky

00:05:10.691 --> 00:05:13.638
Way.
The Milky Way is this band of

00:05:13.638 --> 00:05:17.598
stars across the sky.
It looks like just a white

00:05:17.598 --> 00:05:19.975
streak.
You can't see it in the city

00:05:19.975 --> 00:05:23.149
with city lights.
You know, if you've never seen

00:05:23.149 --> 00:05:27.069
this, go somewhere dark.
Wait until the Moon goes down.

00:05:27.069 --> 00:05:29.470
Get your eyes adapted and then
look for the Milky Way.

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:32.436
It's really very spectacular.
If you really want to do this

00:05:32.436 --> 00:05:35.690
right, do it in the southern
hemisphere, because the center

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:39.149
of our galaxy is down there.
It's quite spectacular.

00:05:39.149 --> 00:05:42.747
Anyway, it had been known since
Galileo's time that what the

00:05:42.747 --> 00:05:45.430
Milky Way really was,
was a band of stars.

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:48.421
And so--that there's this huge
bunch of stars out there,

00:05:48.421 --> 00:05:51.630
so faint, so packed together,
we see it just as a continuous

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:54.772
band of light.
And so, all these stars--that's

00:05:54.772 --> 00:05:57.223
our galaxy.
And the question was whether

00:05:57.223 --> 00:06:00.567
these spiral nebulae might be
little clouds of something or

00:06:00.567 --> 00:06:02.699
other scattered around our
galaxy.

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:06.156
The alternative,
less popular at the time,

00:06:06.156 --> 00:06:11.131
but perhaps more spectacular,
is that the spiral nebulae are

00:06:11.131 --> 00:06:15.600
galaxies themselves--are whole
galaxies of stars,

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:18.850
different from our own galaxy.
These were sometimes referred

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:20.250
to as island universes.

00:06:23.399 --> 00:06:26.661
So, the Milky Way is our own
galaxy, and each one of these

00:06:26.661 --> 00:06:29.350
tiny little spiral things is a
galaxy itself,

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:31.123
located much,
much further away,

00:06:31.123 --> 00:06:34.040
obviously, than any of the
stars that we can see.

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:37.753
And you can see that this is a
question of some importance,

00:06:37.753 --> 00:06:40.185
in particular,
to how big you think the

00:06:40.185 --> 00:06:43.533
Universe is.
If all these spiral nebulae are

00:06:43.533 --> 00:06:47.356
part of our own galaxy,
then maybe what the Universe

00:06:47.356 --> 00:06:50.045
is, is one galaxy.
And at that time,

00:06:50.045 --> 00:06:53.850
it was already starting to be
known how big the galaxy was,

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:57.564
and so forth.
But if each one of them is its

00:06:57.564 --> 00:07:02.359
own galaxy, then obviously,
the entire Universe must be

00:07:02.359 --> 00:07:03.929
much,
much bigger,

00:07:03.929 --> 00:07:07.297
because it contains thousands,
perhaps millions,

00:07:07.297 --> 00:07:11.590
of individual galaxies,
each of them more or less like

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:14.307
our own.
So, we know what the answer's

00:07:14.307 --> 00:07:18.582
going to turn out to be.
This is correct [points to

00:07:18.582 --> 00:07:22.129
"island universes" on slide
notes].

00:07:22.129 --> 00:07:25.279
But they didn't know that in
1920.

00:07:25.279 --> 00:07:28.657
And, in fact,
they staged what was called the

00:07:28.657 --> 00:07:31.881
Great Debate in 1920,
between a very famous

00:07:31.881 --> 00:07:36.180
astronomer named Harlow Shapley,
who was at Harvard.

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:42.186
And he maintained that the
spiral nebulae must be part of

00:07:42.186 --> 00:07:46.471
our own galaxy.
And so, he had many good

00:07:46.471 --> 00:07:50.851
reasons to think this.
There was a lot of evidence

00:07:50.851 --> 00:07:54.670
that the spiral nebulae couldn't
be that far away.

00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:56.589
They must be really quite
nearby.

00:07:56.589 --> 00:08:00.566
And so, Shapely had,
in the true Harvard manner,

00:08:00.566 --> 00:08:05.220
all of the right arguments,
and was completely wrong.

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:07.706
And his opponent,
a man named Curtis,

00:08:07.706 --> 00:08:10.607
educated at Yale,
but at that point working

00:08:10.607 --> 00:08:13.411
somewhere else,
turned out to be entirely

00:08:13.411 --> 00:08:16.753
right, but totally lost the
debate because he just didn't

00:08:16.753 --> 00:08:19.259
have that much evidence backing
him up.

00:08:19.259 --> 00:08:21.920
So, the intuition of the Yale
man comes through.

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:27.430
So, this is a famous incident
in the history of science.

00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:30.730
It garnered enormous attention
at the time.

00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:34.691
Remember, this is a year after
the eclipse expedition has

00:08:34.691 --> 00:08:38.299
verified Einstein's Theory of
General Relativity,

00:08:38.299 --> 00:08:41.023
so people are pretty excited
about modern science at the

00:08:41.023 --> 00:08:43.421
time.
And this was reported widely in

00:08:43.421 --> 00:08:47.246
the press.
So, this is another one of our,

00:08:47.246 --> 00:08:52.340
sort of, science fables,
here, "The Great Debate."

00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:58.626
And one version of the moral of
this story might be,

00:08:58.626 --> 00:09:04.542
you can have all the right
arguments and still be

00:09:04.542 --> 00:09:10.706
wrong--have many good arguments
and still be wrong,

00:09:10.706 --> 00:09:15.389
as Mr.
Shapley turned out to be.

00:09:15.389 --> 00:09:16.658
Interestingly,
at the time,

00:09:16.658 --> 00:09:19.244
in 1920, they thought,
you know, it's going to take us

00:09:19.244 --> 00:09:21.488
a long time to really get to the
truth of this,

00:09:21.488 --> 00:09:23.440
and turned out not to be the
case.

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:26.824
Within just a few years after
the debate had taken place,

00:09:26.824 --> 00:09:28.879
this problem was totally
solved.

00:09:28.879 --> 00:09:34.069
And the man who solved it was
perhaps the greatest

00:09:34.069 --> 00:09:40.529
observational astronomer of the
twentieth century--a man named

00:09:40.529 --> 00:09:45.065
Edwin Hubble,
after whom a telescope was

00:09:45.065 --> 00:09:50.213
subsequently named.
And what helped solve this was

00:09:50.213 --> 00:09:53.810
simply better equipment.
And, in fact,

00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:58.950
starting kind of a trend that
has continued for a century now,

00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:02.125
what happened was-- So,
Hubble was out in California,

00:10:02.125 --> 00:10:04.629
where there are nice,
clear skies,

00:10:04.629 --> 00:10:09.851
and persuaded a rich man to
give a lot of money to build a

00:10:09.851 --> 00:10:13.960
really big telescope.
This was a 100" telescope.

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:19.700
That's the diameter of the--the
diameter of the mirror.

00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:22.733
This is actually still in use,
although the site is no good

00:10:22.733 --> 00:10:25.820
because it's way too near to the
lights of San Francisco.

00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:29.580
But he took this brand new
telescope.

00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:33.468
He looked at the spiral nebulae.
And he did the same thing to

00:10:33.468 --> 00:10:37.279
the spiral nebulae that Galileo
had done to the Milky Way.

00:10:37.279 --> 00:10:39.690
He resolved it into individual
stars.

00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:44.547
And he could see the individual
stars in these spiral nebulae,

00:10:44.547 --> 00:10:49.244
and discovered in the nearest
of them that they were made up

00:10:49.244 --> 00:10:51.614
of stars.
And then, he noticed that the

00:10:51.614 --> 00:10:54.100
stars that were making them up
were incredibly faint.

00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:56.838
And that even the brightest
stars in these things were

00:10:56.838 --> 00:10:59.203
incredibly faint.
And so, he inferred the

00:10:59.203 --> 00:11:01.668
distance to these things by
assuming that,

00:11:01.668 --> 00:11:03.622
you know,
they're kind of ordinary stars,

00:11:03.622 --> 00:11:05.610
like any other kind of stars,
except they're way,

00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:07.804
way fainter,
and therefore they must be much

00:11:07.804 --> 00:11:10.412
further away.
And this was compelling

00:11:10.412 --> 00:11:14.576
evidence that these spiral
nebulae really were island

00:11:14.576 --> 00:11:17.460
universes--galaxies like our
own.

00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:22.163
And the key thing to do--that
is, to have a telescope powerful

00:11:22.163 --> 00:11:26.789
enough to resolve some of the
nearby examples into individual

00:11:26.789 --> 00:11:31.259
stars.
So, there are many galaxies.

00:11:31.259 --> 00:11:39.200
This was known shortly after
the Great Debate took place.

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:42.491
And that made the Universe very
much larger than people had

00:11:42.491 --> 00:11:45.215
previously suspected,
because there are all these

00:11:45.215 --> 00:11:48.324
galaxies around.
So, Hubble was the great expert

00:11:48.324 --> 00:11:51.019
at observing galaxies.
And so, the next thing he

00:11:51.019 --> 00:11:53.528
decided he would look at
is--okay, now we know these

00:11:53.528 --> 00:11:56.248
things are galaxies,
let's check out their-- you

00:11:56.248 --> 00:11:58.720
know, he took Doppler shift
measurements.

00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:01.510
He's trying to figure out the
motions of galaxies.

00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:11.799
And so, he discovered a very
strange thing.

00:12:11.799 --> 00:12:15.070
Namely, that they are all going
away from us.

00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:18.840
Every galaxy he measured was
redshifted.

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:22.150
And so, by the usual Doppler
shift interpretation of these

00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:24.880
things, they must all be moving
away from us.

00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:36.851
And Hubble went further,
and he created one of the most

00:12:36.851 --> 00:12:40.279
famous diagrams in all of
astronomy,

00:12:40.279 --> 00:12:44.585
in which he plots
redshift--which is to say

00:12:44.585 --> 00:12:51.144
Z, which is to say radial
velocity divided by the speed of

00:12:51.144 --> 00:12:54.197
light,
at least in the Newtonian

00:12:54.197 --> 00:12:57.279
approximation,
which he was working in,

00:12:57.279 --> 00:13:00.560
versus distance.
So, he figured out how far away

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:04.159
these galaxies were.
He measured their redshift.

00:13:04.159 --> 00:13:07.653
And what he discovered is that
these things were very tightly

00:13:07.653 --> 00:13:09.944
correlated.
So, if you plot each galaxy,

00:13:09.944 --> 00:13:12.740
measure a distance and a
redshift for each galaxy,

00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:15.783
for a large number of galaxies,
what you find is that they line

00:13:15.783 --> 00:13:16.520
up like this.

00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:27.659
This is the so-called Hubble
Diagram, and it's basically the

00:13:27.659 --> 00:13:33.970
thing we're going to be talking
about for the next five weeks or

00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:38.978
so--is Hubble Diagrams,
and what you can infer from

00:13:38.978 --> 00:13:43.033
them.
And the Hubble Diagram can be,

00:13:43.033 --> 00:13:46.480
sort of, summed up in an
equation.

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:51.328
If this is a straight line,
then it must be true that the

00:13:51.328 --> 00:13:55.830
velocity of a given galaxy is
equal to a constant,

00:13:55.830 --> 00:13:59.360
which was given the letter
H, for the Hubble

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:03.760
Constant, times the distance.
This is Hubble's Constant.

00:14:07.669 --> 00:14:13.232
And that just basically says in
algebra what this says

00:14:13.232 --> 00:14:19.529
pictorially, that these things
line up in a straight line.

00:14:19.529 --> 00:14:23.179
The Hubble Constant is an
extremely important number.

00:14:23.179 --> 00:14:26.378
You measure it by creating
these Hubble Diagrams and just

00:14:26.378 --> 00:14:30.348
measuring the slope of the line.
And the primary scientific

00:14:30.348 --> 00:14:34.873
purpose of the Hubble Space
Telescope, the largest and most

00:14:34.873 --> 00:14:38.149
expensive science project ever
created,

00:14:38.149 --> 00:14:40.516
was to get an accurate
measurement of the Hubble

00:14:40.516 --> 00:14:42.174
Constant.
So, all these beautiful

00:14:42.174 --> 00:14:45.240
pictures you see are byproducts.
The purpose of the thing was to

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:47.149
measure the Hubble Constant
accurately.

00:14:47.149 --> 00:14:48.779
There had been,
for many years,

00:14:48.779 --> 00:14:51.169
a dispute over what the correct
value was.

00:14:51.169 --> 00:14:54.115
This was resolved by the Space
Telescope and other things

00:14:54.115 --> 00:14:58.009
within the past decade.
And this was a big success.

00:14:58.009 --> 00:14:59.789
We now know what the Hubble
Constant is.

00:14:59.789 --> 00:15:02.659
It's measured in somewhat weird
units.

00:15:02.659 --> 00:15:07.863
It's seventy or so kilometers
per second, per megaparsec

00:15:07.863 --> 00:15:09.539
[Mpc].
All right.

00:15:09.539 --> 00:15:11.409
Now, let's pause there for just
a moment.

00:15:11.409 --> 00:15:16.139
You can see why they use this
peculiar unit.

00:15:16.139 --> 00:15:19.279
Because you want to--they're
measuring velocity in kilometers

00:15:19.279 --> 00:15:21.582
per second, and they're
measuring distance in

00:15:21.582 --> 00:15:23.511
megaparsecs.
Mega, of course,

00:15:23.511 --> 00:15:26.160
doesn't just mean big.
It's a technical term.

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:32.000
It means a million.
It means 10^(6) parsecs.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:39.015
A parsec, you will remember,
is about three light years,

00:15:39.015 --> 00:15:45.519
or 3 x 10^(16) meters,
or 3 x 10^(13) kilometers.

00:15:45.519 --> 00:15:49.479
And so, for each megaparsec
that a given galaxy is away--and

00:15:49.479 --> 00:15:52.970
notice, now, we've changed our
units from parsecs,

00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:55.429
which we used for stars,
to megaparsecs.

00:15:55.429 --> 00:15:58.920
That's basically the change in
the scale of the Universe that

00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:02.353
came about when people realized
that the spiral nebulae were

00:16:02.353 --> 00:16:05.042
galaxies.
So, now you have to talk about

00:16:05.042 --> 00:16:07.924
megaparsecs.
In fact, now we also talk,

00:16:07.924 --> 00:16:10.755
from time to time,
about gigaparsecs,

00:16:10.755 --> 00:16:15.311
which are billions of parsecs.
For each megaparsec that a

00:16:15.311 --> 00:16:19.007
galaxy is away from us,
it moves 70 kilometers per

00:16:19.007 --> 00:16:22.569
second more away from us.
So, something that's 10

00:16:22.569 --> 00:16:25.909
megaparsecs away ought to be
moving 700 kilometers per

00:16:25.909 --> 00:16:27.838
second.
Something that's 100

00:16:27.838 --> 00:16:31.865
megaparsecs away would be moving
7,000 kilometers a second away

00:16:31.865 --> 00:16:34.373
from us.
And that's just an expression

00:16:34.373 --> 00:16:37.314
of what this relationships is.
Hubble, by the way,

00:16:37.314 --> 00:16:40.900
got this quite wrong.
He correctly lined them all up,

00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:45.468
but his value for the Hubble
Constant turned out to be about

00:16:45.468 --> 00:16:47.039
500,
in these units,

00:16:47.039 --> 00:16:50.609
which was quite wrong,
and we'll talk about that--why

00:16:50.609 --> 00:16:52.932
that was, later on.
But, by now,

00:16:52.932 --> 00:16:56.518
with the Hubble Space
Telescope, we totally know this,

00:16:56.518 --> 00:17:00.680
and that's an important result.
Now, this diagram and this

00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:04.903
relationship are basically the
key to what we're going to be

00:17:04.903 --> 00:17:07.064
talking about.
So, in fact,

00:17:07.064 --> 00:17:11.393
the fact that there's this
linear relationship tells you

00:17:11.393 --> 00:17:14.466
several things.
It tells you that the Universe

00:17:14.466 --> 00:17:15.240
is expanding.

00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:22.786
And because of that,
it tells you that

00:17:22.786 --> 00:17:26.656
the--indirectly,
there's other evidence that has

00:17:26.656 --> 00:17:30.609
to be brought to bear,
as well, that the Big Bang

00:17:30.609 --> 00:17:33.951
exists.
So, this is the basis of Big

00:17:33.951 --> 00:17:36.748
Bang cosmology.
I don't want to talk about that

00:17:36.748 --> 00:17:38.970
right now.
We'll talk about the Big Bang

00:17:38.970 --> 00:17:40.737
on Tuesday.
We'll have a whole big

00:17:40.737 --> 00:17:43.453
question-and-answer session,
so, bring all your questions

00:17:43.453 --> 00:17:45.200
about the Big Bang and
cosmology.

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:49.516
We'll do that all up on Tuesday.
What I want to talk about now

00:17:49.516 --> 00:17:52.938
is much more mundane.
Namely, how do you measure

00:17:52.938 --> 00:17:55.840
these points?
How do you do this?

00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:59.788
How do you create this diagram?
This diagram has these fabulous

00:17:59.788 --> 00:18:02.378
implications,
but in order to understand

00:18:02.378 --> 00:18:05.608
what's going on,
you'd better know how you get

00:18:05.608 --> 00:18:10.880
the diagram in the first place.
Now, part of it's clear.

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:14.759
The x-axis we understand
fairly well.

00:18:14.759 --> 00:18:23.550
Measuring radial
velocity--that's easy.

00:18:23.550 --> 00:18:25.340
That's just the Doppler shift.

00:18:29.069 --> 00:18:34.192
So, that comes directly out of
a particular kind of measurement

00:18:34.192 --> 00:18:37.957
that you can readily do.
The y-axis is the

00:18:37.957 --> 00:18:40.450
biggest problem in all of
astronomy;

00:18:40.450 --> 00:18:42.950
namely, how do you measure the
distance to something?

00:18:42.950 --> 00:18:46.006
And, if you think about it,
that's what this Great Debate

00:18:46.006 --> 00:18:48.798
was all about.
Some people thought that the

00:18:48.798 --> 00:18:52.361
distances to these spiral
nebulae were a few hundred,

00:18:52.361 --> 00:18:54.759
or maybe a few thousand
parsecs.

00:18:54.759 --> 00:18:58.278
Other people thought they were
millions of parsecs away,

00:18:58.278 --> 00:19:00.710
and it wasn't clear which was
right.

00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:03.530
And if you think about looking
up into the sky,

00:19:03.530 --> 00:19:07.331
looking at stars in the sky at
night, you can see where there's

00:19:07.331 --> 00:19:09.359
a problem.
You look up there.

00:19:09.359 --> 00:19:11.899
You see a bunch of stars,
and suddenly one of them shoots

00:19:11.899 --> 00:19:14.750
across the sky.
It's a shooting star.

00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:18.329
Except for the motion across
the sky, they don't look that

00:19:18.329 --> 00:19:21.406
different, and yet,
some of them--the fixed stars,

00:19:21.406 --> 00:19:23.730
are hundreds of light years
away.

00:19:23.730 --> 00:19:27.308
The planets,
which look much the same to the

00:19:27.308 --> 00:19:30.554
naked eye are,
you know, a million times

00:19:30.554 --> 00:19:32.854
closer.
And that shooting star is in

00:19:32.854 --> 00:19:36.256
the top of the atmosphere.
And it's very hard to tell what

00:19:36.256 --> 00:19:39.790
the distance is when you just
kind of look up there.

00:19:39.790 --> 00:19:42.860
And so, distance is hard.

00:19:51.769 --> 00:19:56.183
And that's basically the
problem I want to talk about for

00:19:56.183 --> 00:19:59.590
the rest of today's class.
How do you measure distances?

00:19:59.590 --> 00:20:02.068
Yes?
Student: You said that

00:20:02.068 --> 00:20:04.579
redshift was easy,
but how do we know what the

00:20:04.579 --> 00:20:06.781
original wavelength is?
Professor Charles

00:20:06.781 --> 00:20:08.245
Bailyn: Oh,
how do you know what the

00:20:08.245 --> 00:20:11.130
original wavelength was?
You make the assumption that

00:20:11.130 --> 00:20:15.404
atomic physics and chemistry are
the same in the distant galaxies

00:20:15.404 --> 00:20:17.595
as they are here,
and therefore,

00:20:17.595 --> 00:20:21.320
hydrogen should emit lines at
the same frequency as they do in

00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:24.403
the atmosphere.
Now, one of the things you can

00:20:24.403 --> 00:20:28.170
do if you don't like what the
cosmological implications of

00:20:28.170 --> 00:20:29.559
things is,
you can say,

00:20:29.559 --> 00:20:31.677
well, rather than interpreting
this as cosmology,

00:20:31.677 --> 00:20:34.280
let's just say that in distant
portions of the Universe,

00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:37.259
physics is different.
If you go down that road,

00:20:37.259 --> 00:20:39.779
you can get any answer you
want.

00:20:39.779 --> 00:20:47.280
And this has been seriously
discussed from time to time.

00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:52.130
All right.
So, how do you measure distance?

00:20:52.130 --> 00:20:52.830
That's the key.

00:21:01.910 --> 00:21:04.265
Well, there's one,
and only one,

00:21:04.265 --> 00:21:08.140
kind of, direct way you could
imagine doing this.

00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:11.723
Here's the Sun.
Here's the Earth going around

00:21:11.723 --> 00:21:12.280
the Sun.

00:21:16.570 --> 00:21:23.526
Here's a nearby star.
And here are a bunch of other,

00:21:23.526 --> 00:21:27.111
much further away stars.
They're all scattered around

00:21:27.111 --> 00:21:29.832
the sky.
And you observe this nearby

00:21:29.832 --> 00:21:32.809
star during the course of the
year.

00:21:32.809 --> 00:21:35.390
As the year goes on,
you observe it repeatedly.

00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:38.140
You observe it from here,
for example.

00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:43.043
And when you observe it from
here, it's in this direction,

00:21:43.043 --> 00:21:46.312
and therefore,
it appears to be in that

00:21:46.312 --> 00:21:49.839
position relative to the other
stars.

00:21:49.839 --> 00:21:53.948
Whereas, when you observe it
here, it's in a little bit of a

00:21:53.948 --> 00:21:57.640
different position with respect
to the other stars.

00:21:57.640 --> 00:22:00.483
It looks like it's here.
And so, if you observe this

00:22:00.483 --> 00:22:04.257
star repeatedly over the course
of the year, it appears to move

00:22:04.257 --> 00:22:07.910
back and forth against the
background of the other stars.

00:22:07.910 --> 00:22:11.986
This is a triangle.
We know what to do about

00:22:11.986 --> 00:22:15.112
triangles.
You can measure this angle

00:22:15.112 --> 00:22:20.513
because that's just the angular
separation of the two apparent

00:22:20.513 --> 00:22:23.790
positions of this star in the
sky.

00:22:23.790 --> 00:22:27.210
We know this distance.
That's 1 Astronomical Unit,

00:22:27.210 --> 00:22:30.109
because this is the Earth going
around the Sun.

00:22:30.109 --> 00:22:34.147
And then, what we want to know
is the distance to this star,

00:22:34.147 --> 00:22:35.755
D.
Let's call that

00:22:35.755 --> 00:22:38.416
D_1.
And we know the equation for

00:22:38.416 --> 00:22:40.369
this already.
We've done this before.

00:22:40.369 --> 00:22:43.183
This is α =
D_2 /

00:22:43.183 --> 00:22:47.155
D_1,
where D_2,

00:22:47.155 --> 00:22:51.210
in this case,
is exactly 1 Astronomical Unit.

00:22:51.210 --> 00:22:56.505
And you may recall that if you
measure this in arc seconds,

00:22:56.505 --> 00:22:59.609
and you measure this in
parsecs,

00:22:59.609 --> 00:23:04.081
and you measure this in AU,
you get a consistent set of

00:23:04.081 --> 00:23:10.361
answers.
And so, the way it works out is

00:23:10.361 --> 00:23:20.210
1 / α, in arc seconds,
equals the distance in parsecs.

00:23:20.210 --> 00:23:22.904
And the reason that works is
because D_2,

00:23:22.904 --> 00:23:24.559
by this method,
is always equal to 1

00:23:24.559 --> 00:23:27.116
Astronomical Unit.
If you try this on Jupiter,

00:23:27.116 --> 00:23:30.150
you have to account for the
fact that Jupiter's further

00:23:30.150 --> 00:23:32.196
away.
This is called the parallax

00:23:32.196 --> 00:23:32.670
method.

00:23:36.050 --> 00:23:38.895
It's common in surveying.
You know, you look at the same

00:23:38.895 --> 00:23:42.000
thing from two different places.
You can figure out distances by

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:43.849
basically trigonometry,
here.

00:23:43.849 --> 00:23:45.980
This is called the parallax
method.

00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:53.408
And a parsec--this is the
definition of a parsec--is one

00:23:53.408 --> 00:23:57.160
parallax second.
It's a contraction.

00:23:57.160 --> 00:24:00.511
Because you measure an arc
second and the distance is one

00:24:00.511 --> 00:24:02.417
parsec.
And that is the definition of a

00:24:02.417 --> 00:24:04.518
parsec.
That's why we use parsec as a

00:24:04.518 --> 00:24:07.592
distance measurement,
because it comes naturally out

00:24:07.592 --> 00:24:11.182
of this parallax method.
And so, that's a fairly direct

00:24:11.182 --> 00:24:14.359
geometric method.
This is a surveying technique.

00:24:14.359 --> 00:24:16.647
This is how--and this is a
straightforward way of getting

00:24:16.647 --> 00:24:18.473
the distance.
And the problem with this is

00:24:18.473 --> 00:24:20.769
that it only works on things
that are really nearby.

00:24:20.769 --> 00:24:23.352
Because we can measure,
you know, maybe,

00:24:23.352 --> 00:24:26.465
a hundredth of an arc second
change in position,

00:24:26.465 --> 00:24:29.929
but no better than that.
And so, you can only get

00:24:29.929 --> 00:24:33.752
measurements of distances in
this way out to a few hundred

00:24:33.752 --> 00:24:37.525
parsecs.
Works to a kind of maximum,

00:24:37.525 --> 00:24:43.033
given our current
instrumentation of a few hundred

00:24:43.033 --> 00:24:44.270
parsecs.

00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:51.599
But the center of our galaxy is
8,000 parsecs away.

00:24:51.599 --> 00:24:55.170
These other galaxies are
megaparsecs away.

00:24:55.170 --> 00:24:58.086
We can't be measuring 1
one-millionth of an arc second,

00:24:58.086 --> 00:25:00.839
at least not at the moment,
in terms of parallax.

00:25:00.839 --> 00:25:04.349
So, this only works for the
very nearest stars.

00:25:04.349 --> 00:25:08.203
And that's why there was all
this confusion about the spiral

00:25:08.203 --> 00:25:10.945
nebulae because,
you know, if they were 500

00:25:10.945 --> 00:25:13.950
parsecs away,
you'd never be able to tell.

00:25:13.950 --> 00:25:17.734
So, most other distance
measurements--methods of

00:25:17.734 --> 00:25:21.920
distance--are some form of
what's called the Standard

00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:23.370
Candle Method.

00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:35.480
So, here's how the Standard
Candle Method works.

00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:41.529
It's a three-step process.
Part one, you look at something.

00:25:41.529 --> 00:25:49.690
You know how bright something
is--how bright something is.

00:25:49.690 --> 00:25:53.209
This is basically a version of
what Hubble did when he figured

00:25:53.209 --> 00:25:55.690
out that the spiral nebulae must
be very,

00:25:55.690 --> 00:25:57.634
very distant,
and must, therefore,

00:25:57.634 --> 00:26:00.116
be island universes.
You know how bright something

00:26:00.116 --> 00:26:01.545
is.
In the case of Hubble,

00:26:01.545 --> 00:26:04.480
he's looking at the brightest
stars in the galaxy.

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:07.397
He figures they're about as
bright as the brightest stars in

00:26:07.397 --> 00:26:09.524
our own galaxy,
so, he knows how bright they

00:26:09.524 --> 00:26:15.289
are.
Part two, you measure how

00:26:15.289 --> 00:26:20.660
bright the object looks.

00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:25.660
You take a picture of it,
or you count photons,

00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:28.110
or whatever it is that you do,
and you figure out how bright

00:26:28.110 --> 00:26:29.520
it looks.
And obviously,

00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:32.939
for something of a given
brightness, the further away it

00:26:32.939 --> 00:26:35.847
is, the fainter it looks.
And we know exactly how that

00:26:35.847 --> 00:26:37.789
works.
It's a distance-squared thing.

00:26:37.789 --> 00:26:41.559
If it's twice as far away,
it's a fourth as bright.

00:26:41.559 --> 00:26:44.509
If it's three times further
away, it's 1/9th as bright.

00:26:44.509 --> 00:26:46.540
It goes as one over the
distance, squared.

00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:50.617
This is a well-known fact.
You can try this out with light

00:26:50.617 --> 00:26:53.908
bulbs at home.
And so, if you know how bright

00:26:53.908 --> 00:26:57.805
it is, and you measure how
bright it appears to be,

00:26:57.805 --> 00:27:00.690
then you can compute the
distance.

00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:11.186
Okay.
And this is why it's called a

00:27:11.186 --> 00:27:14.942
standard candle--oh,
so, the way this is--how do you

00:27:14.942 --> 00:27:17.029
know this?
That's the big question.

00:27:17.029 --> 00:27:19.440
How do you know how bright the
thing is in the first place?

00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:23.578
And the answer is,
usually, that you're looking at

00:27:23.578 --> 00:27:28.140
something which is an example of
a class of objects,

00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:36.340
like stars, or bright stars,
whose brightness is known.

00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:44.670
And that's why you use the
term, standard candle.

00:27:44.670 --> 00:27:47.140
Because here's a bunch of
things.

00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:49.754
They're all the same brightness.
They all have the same standard

00:27:49.754 --> 00:27:52.020
candle power.
Some of them look fainter than

00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:54.650
others, but ones that look
fainter obviously have to be

00:27:54.650 --> 00:27:56.842
further away.
And if you know the true

00:27:56.842 --> 00:28:00.257
brightness of this class of
objects, you can figure out how

00:28:00.257 --> 00:28:03.660
far away any example of it is.
Hence, standard candles.

00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:13.204
And the problem with this is
this phrase here,

00:28:13.204 --> 00:28:19.862
as you can pretty clearly see.
If you get it wrong--if you

00:28:19.862 --> 00:28:24.529
make the wrong assumption about
how bright these objects are,

00:28:24.529 --> 00:28:27.784
you're going to screw this up
completely, and that's what

00:28:27.784 --> 00:28:30.157
Hubble did.
Hubble was looking at a

00:28:30.157 --> 00:28:34.308
particular kind of bright star,
which he thought he knew how

00:28:34.308 --> 00:28:36.769
bright it was,
and he was wrong.

00:28:36.769 --> 00:28:40.480
And so, he got the wrong Hubble
Constant.

00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:43.559
Now, because he used the same
kind of star in all his

00:28:43.559 --> 00:28:46.757
galaxies, he got it the same
amount wrong for all these

00:28:46.757 --> 00:28:49.809
different galaxies.
So, they still lined up.

00:28:49.809 --> 00:28:52.750
They just lined up along the
wrong track.

00:28:52.750 --> 00:28:55.593
So, it was still true that
something that he thought was

00:28:55.593 --> 00:28:58.644
twice as far away as something
else was in fact twice as far

00:28:58.644 --> 00:29:01.980
away as something else.
He just got both of those

00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:04.620
numbers wrong by the same
factor.

00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:07.513
Okay.
This brings us to the awkward

00:29:07.513 --> 00:29:10.580
question of, "How do you measure
brightness?"

00:29:17.849 --> 00:29:23.477
And now, we have to talk about
one of the great impediments to

00:29:23.477 --> 00:29:28.089
learning astronomy--namely,
the magnitude scale.

00:29:28.089 --> 00:29:36.170
Astronomers count brightness
upside down and logarithmically.

00:29:36.170 --> 00:29:39.634
And I am now obliged,
by my membership in the

00:29:39.634 --> 00:29:43.650
astronomical community,
to inflict this upon you.

00:29:43.650 --> 00:29:46.380
So, the magnitude scale--this
is how we measure brightness.

00:29:46.380 --> 00:29:48.119
It's upside down and
logarithmic.

00:29:48.119 --> 00:29:54.999
And the key numerical
relationship that works looks

00:29:54.999 --> 00:29:58.470
like this.
If you subtract the magnitude

00:29:58.470 --> 00:30:01.985
of one object from another,
that equals minus five halves

00:30:01.985 --> 00:30:05.438
times the log of the ratio of
the brightnesses [-5/2 log

00:30:05.438 --> 00:30:08.640
(b_1/
b_2)].

00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:15.297
Don't panic.
The magic word,

00:30:15.297 --> 00:30:19.459
here, is "help sheet," which
will be posted later this

00:30:19.459 --> 00:30:22.220
afternoon.
So, this is a key equation.

00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:24.069
So, let me just define the
terms.

00:30:24.069 --> 00:30:32.068
This is the magnitude of two
different objects and this is

00:30:32.068 --> 00:30:37.119
the brightness of the two
objects.

00:30:37.119 --> 00:30:39.985
Whereby "brightness," I mean
something sensible,

00:30:39.985 --> 00:30:43.400
like how many photons per
second do you get from them,

00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:49.829
or some other kind of true
measure of how bright they are.

00:30:49.829 --> 00:30:53.438
Now, this is a somewhat awkward
equation, because it's a

00:30:53.438 --> 00:30:56.072
relative equation.
It doesn't tell you what the

00:30:56.072 --> 00:30:58.150
magnitude of either one of these
things is.

00:30:58.150 --> 00:31:02.771
What it tells you is the
magnitude of one compared to

00:31:02.771 --> 00:31:05.001
another.
So, in order to figure out the

00:31:05.001 --> 00:31:07.371
magnitude of something,
you have to know the magnitude

00:31:07.371 --> 00:31:10.082
of something else.
And so, you need one other

00:31:10.082 --> 00:31:13.013
piece of information to have
this be useful,

00:31:13.013 --> 00:31:16.831
which is that they have defined
a particular star to have

00:31:16.831 --> 00:31:22.770
magnitude 0.
The star, Vega,

00:31:22.770 --> 00:31:34.524
is defined to have magnitude 0.
So, if you start with Vega,

00:31:34.524 --> 00:31:37.404
you can figure out the
magnitude of any other given

00:31:37.404 --> 00:31:37.980
object.

00:31:44.150 --> 00:31:47.804
Actually, this is now causing
trouble, because it turns out

00:31:47.804 --> 00:31:50.640
that in the far infrared,
Vega is variable.

00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:54.312
And that's kind of unfortunate
for the basis of the whole

00:31:54.312 --> 00:31:57.329
magnitude system to turn out to
be variable.

00:31:57.329 --> 00:32:00.660
But, they've coped with that in
various ways.

00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:03.483
All right.
Let me pause and remind you of

00:32:03.483 --> 00:32:07.910
some things about logarithms,
which you may have forgotten.

00:32:07.910 --> 00:32:11.904
What's the definition here?
The logarithm of 10^(x)

00:32:11.904 --> 00:32:15.012
= x.
That's the definition of a

00:32:15.012 --> 00:32:18.360
logarithm.
So, for example,

00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:26.956
the logarithm of 3 x 10^(2) is
equal to the logarithm of

00:32:26.956 --> 00:32:36.344
10^(1/2) that's 3 times 10^(2),
is equal to the logarithm of

00:32:36.344 --> 00:32:39.877
10^(2.5).
Because when you multiply

00:32:39.877 --> 00:32:44.532
10^(x) by 10^(y)
you get 10^(x) + y,

00:32:44.532 --> 00:32:47.790
which is equal to 2.5.
That's an example.

00:32:47.790 --> 00:32:51.783
More examples on the help sheet.
Just, in general,

00:32:51.783 --> 00:32:57.683
log (10^(x) x
10^(y)) = x +

00:32:57.683 --> 00:33:01.224
y.
Because when you add those

00:33:01.224 --> 00:33:06.670
together, that's how it works.
log (10^(x) /

00:33:06.670 --> 00:33:12.410
10^(y)) = x -
y.

00:33:12.410 --> 00:33:15.930
Again, because of the way
logarithms multiply together.

00:33:15.930 --> 00:33:21.118
And the logarithm of--let's
see, 10^(x),

00:33:21.118 --> 00:33:26.303
raised to the mth power,
is equal to mx

00:33:26.303 --> 00:33:29.089
[log([10^(x)]^(m)) =
mx].

00:33:29.089 --> 00:33:31.637
This, by the way,
is why logarithms are so

00:33:31.637 --> 00:33:34.910
incredibly useful.
You should always do all your

00:33:34.910 --> 00:33:38.035
arithmetic in logarithms.
You should just automatically

00:33:38.035 --> 00:33:40.240
convert everything in your head
into logarithms.

00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:43.125
In fact, in the days before
calculators, this is how people

00:33:43.125 --> 00:33:45.877
used to do arithmetic.
This is how slide rules work,

00:33:45.877 --> 00:33:47.803
I should say.
They mark the thing off

00:33:47.803 --> 00:33:50.609
logarithmically and then you
move them back and forth.

00:33:50.609 --> 00:33:53.141
And people, you know--if you
memorize, like,

00:33:53.141 --> 00:33:55.789
ten logarithms of a few
convenient numbers,

00:33:55.789 --> 00:33:58.907
you can do all sorts of
calculations in your head

00:33:58.907 --> 00:34:01.829
because multiplication turns
into addition,

00:34:01.829 --> 00:34:03.390
which is much,
much easier to do.

00:34:03.390 --> 00:34:06.472
And so, if you can convert
things into logarithms in your

00:34:06.472 --> 00:34:09.060
head, then all you have to do is
add numbers.

00:34:09.060 --> 00:34:11.825
That's easy.
Similarly, taking something to

00:34:11.825 --> 00:34:13.635
the mth power,
for example,

00:34:13.635 --> 00:34:15.719
taking the square root of a
number,

00:34:15.719 --> 00:34:18.786
or taking the cube of a number,
or something like that,

00:34:18.786 --> 00:34:22.452
reduces down to multiplication.
It's hard to take a square root

00:34:22.452 --> 00:34:25.343
of a number in your head,
but it's easy to divide a

00:34:25.343 --> 00:34:27.656
number by two,
which is the equivalent of

00:34:27.656 --> 00:34:30.248
taking a square root.
So, if you're thinking in

00:34:30.248 --> 00:34:32.469
logarithms, all you got to do is
divide it by two,

00:34:32.469 --> 00:34:35.272
and you can amaze your friends
by doing square roots in your

00:34:35.272 --> 00:34:38.074
head--if your friends are the
kinds of people who are amazed

00:34:38.074 --> 00:34:42.600
by that kind of thing.
Mine are.

00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:46.203
And so, I recommend this to you.
If you have to prove that

00:34:46.203 --> 00:34:49.115
you've learned something in
college, spend a half hour

00:34:49.115 --> 00:34:52.027
memorizing ten different
logarithms and then just blow

00:34:52.027 --> 00:34:54.830
people's minds by taking square
roots on bets.

00:34:54.830 --> 00:34:56.460
Okay.

00:34:59.650 --> 00:35:05.239
Or you can do problem sets in
Astronomy 160.

00:35:05.239 --> 00:35:10.255
For example,
Sirius--the star Sirius,

00:35:10.255 --> 00:35:18.475
which is the brightest star in
the sky, is about three times

00:35:18.475 --> 00:35:23.740
brighter than Vega.
So, what's its magnitude?

00:35:30.530 --> 00:35:33.636
What's its magnitude?
Well, let's write down the

00:35:33.636 --> 00:35:36.718
equation.
Magnitude of Sirius minus the

00:35:36.718 --> 00:35:41.415
magnitude of Vega is equal to
-5/2 log of the brightness of

00:35:41.415 --> 00:35:45.059
Sirius, divided by the
brightness of Vega.

00:35:45.059 --> 00:35:49.512
Now, any time you see three
times brighter or twenty times

00:35:49.512 --> 00:35:54.199
fainter, or anything of that
kind, what you're really talking

00:35:54.199 --> 00:35:57.268
about is a ratio.
If Sirius is three times

00:35:57.268 --> 00:36:00.065
brighter than Vega,
that means the brightness of

00:36:00.065 --> 00:36:03.219
Sirius divided by the brightness
of Vega is three.

00:36:03.219 --> 00:36:04.869
That's what that statement
means.

00:36:04.869 --> 00:36:08.120
And so, we can just plug it
right in.

00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:13.739
-5/2 log (3).
Because Sirius is three times

00:36:13.739 --> 00:36:16.950
brighter than Vega,
so that ratio is equal to 3.

00:36:16.950 --> 00:36:22.409
What's the log of 3?
One half. Thank you very much.

00:36:22.409 --> 00:36:27.389
This is equal to - 5/2 log
(10^(1/2)).

00:36:27.389 --> 00:36:29.889
You will remember that the
square root of 10 is 3.

00:36:29.889 --> 00:36:33.542
So, 3 is also equal to π,
but for logarithms,

00:36:33.542 --> 00:36:38.331
the important thing is that 3
is equal to the square root of

00:36:38.331 --> 00:36:43.210
10.
And so, this is (-5/2) x (1/2).

00:36:43.210 --> 00:36:48.952
-5/4.
Now, the magnitude of Vega,

00:36:48.952 --> 00:36:51.559
we know.
That's 0.

00:36:51.559 --> 00:36:58.489
So, the magnitude of Sirius is
equal to -5/4.

00:36:58.489 --> 00:37:01.760
This is what I mean by the fact
that the scale is upside down.

00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:04.684
The brighter the star is,
the lower--or,

00:37:04.684 --> 00:37:08.360
if it goes through 0,
the more negative the number

00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:12.569
becomes.
Minus 1 is a brighter star than

00:37:12.569 --> 00:37:15.420
0.
0 is a brighter star than 2;

00:37:15.420 --> 00:37:18.860
2 is a brighter star than 5,
and so forth.

00:37:18.860 --> 00:37:23.795
So, low numbers are bright.
The magnitude of the Sun,

00:37:23.795 --> 00:37:26.974
obviously extremely bright when
we look at it,

00:37:26.974 --> 00:37:30.636
turns out to be -26.5.
And the magnitude of the

00:37:30.636 --> 00:37:35.219
faintest star that can be seen
with the Hubble Telescope is

00:37:35.219 --> 00:37:38.380
about +30, which is incredibly
faint.

00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:40.346
And that, by the way,
is why, again,

00:37:40.346 --> 00:37:42.369
why logarithms are such good
news.

00:37:42.369 --> 00:37:46.346
Because the entire range of
things we can see in the sky

00:37:46.346 --> 00:37:49.305
goes from -26 to +30.
Those are numbers you can get

00:37:49.305 --> 00:37:51.987
your mind around.
In fact, the difference in

00:37:51.987 --> 00:37:56.321
brightness between those things
is a number that I can't even

00:37:56.321 --> 00:38:00.315
pronounce.
And so, much easier to deal

00:38:00.315 --> 00:38:05.719
with magnitudes.
All right.

00:38:05.719 --> 00:38:09.788
Now, that has to do with how
bright things are,

00:38:09.788 --> 00:38:14.829
how bright things appear to be,
or how bright they are.

00:38:14.829 --> 00:38:17.590
But remember what we're trying
to do.

00:38:17.590 --> 00:38:20.437
We're trying to compare how
bright something is,

00:38:20.437 --> 00:38:22.860
intrinsically,
to how bright it looks.

00:38:22.860 --> 00:38:26.432
And this gets you into the
question of--there are actually

00:38:26.432 --> 00:38:32.751
two kinds of magnitude.
The intrinsic brightness of an

00:38:32.751 --> 00:38:39.877
object is something called
absolute magnitude,

00:38:39.877 --> 00:38:48.904
whereas the observed brightness
is referred to as apparent

00:38:48.904 --> 00:38:53.389
magnitude.
And now, the astronomers screw

00:38:53.389 --> 00:38:56.060
you up again,
because we have different

00:38:56.060 --> 00:38:59.575
symbols for the apparent
magnitude and the absolute

00:38:59.575 --> 00:39:03.430
magnitude.
The absolute magnitude is given

00:39:03.430 --> 00:39:08.398
a symbol capital M,
and the apparent magnitude is

00:39:08.398 --> 00:39:13.026
given the symbol small m.
And the problem is that you

00:39:13.026 --> 00:39:15.960
can't actually tell the
difference between those two in

00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:18.460
my handwriting,
and probably yours as well.

00:39:18.460 --> 00:39:23.162
So, this leads to untold
confusion, but that's the way

00:39:23.162 --> 00:39:25.609
life is.
And the relationship between

00:39:25.609 --> 00:39:27.670
these two has to relate to
distance.

00:39:27.670 --> 00:39:29.893
Okay.
Before we get there,

00:39:29.893 --> 00:39:32.200
the definition of absolute
magnitude.

00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:41.875
You'll notice that in the
previous comparison of Sirius to

00:39:41.875 --> 00:39:44.280
Vega, I was talking about
apparent magnitude.

00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:51.160
How bright it looks in the sky.
Absolute magnitude is defined

00:39:51.160 --> 00:40:01.916
as the apparent magnitude if the
object in question were exactly

00:40:01.916 --> 00:40:07.105
10 parsecs away.
So, the Sun has an apparent

00:40:07.105 --> 00:40:11.139
magnitude, as I said before,
-26.5, but it's actually not

00:40:11.139 --> 00:40:15.228
that bright of a star.
If you took the Sun out to a

00:40:15.228 --> 00:40:19.314
distance of 10 parsecs,
its magnitude would be 4.7,

00:40:19.314 --> 00:40:24.300
which is among the fainter
stars you could see in the sky.

00:40:24.300 --> 00:40:28.766
And so, the absolute magnitude
of the Sun is 4.7,

00:40:28.766 --> 00:40:33.139
even though its apparent
magnitude is - 26.5.

00:40:33.139 --> 00:40:36.011
So, it turns,
for example,

00:40:36.011 --> 00:40:41.409
that the star Sirius is about 3
parsecs away.

00:40:41.409 --> 00:40:44.289
And so--oh, I haven't told you
an important thing yet.

00:40:44.289 --> 00:40:45.559
We'll come back to this in a
second, though.

00:40:45.559 --> 00:40:48.864
The problem set problem
obviously is going to be what is

00:40:48.864 --> 00:40:52.288
the absolute magnitude of
Sirius, but I have to write down

00:40:52.288 --> 00:40:55.001
the formula first.
Little m,

00:40:55.001 --> 00:40:59.261
that's the apparent magnitude,
minus big M,

00:40:59.261 --> 00:41:05.695
that's the absolute magnitude,
is equal to 5 times the

00:41:05.695 --> 00:41:12.360
logarithm of the distance over
10 parsecs.

00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:16.583
Now, notice what happens.
If the distance is equal to 10

00:41:16.583 --> 00:41:20.320
parsecs, then you've got the log
of 1.

00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:22.680
What's the log of 1?
Zero.

00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:26.291
Thank you very much.
Because this is the log of

00:41:26.291 --> 00:41:28.989
10^(0).
log 10^(0) = 0.

00:41:28.989 --> 00:41:33.621
And so, if the log of this
thing is 0, then this right-hand

00:41:33.621 --> 00:41:36.056
side is 0.
So, at a distance of 10

00:41:36.056 --> 00:41:39.585
parsecs, the apparent magnitude
is equal to the absolute

00:41:39.585 --> 00:41:41.893
magnitude,
because m - M =

00:41:41.893 --> 00:41:44.180
0, which is exactly what the
definition was.

00:41:44.180 --> 00:41:47.870
So, that works.
So, example.

00:41:47.870 --> 00:41:55.208
Sirius.
So, what is the absolute

00:41:55.208 --> 00:42:01.780
magnitude of Sirius?
All right.

00:42:01.780 --> 00:42:04.971
Here we go.
The apparent magnitude,

00:42:04.971 --> 00:42:07.896
we figured out just a minute
ago, is - 5/4,

00:42:07.896 --> 00:42:11.935
minus the absolute magnitude,
which is what we're trying to

00:42:11.935 --> 00:42:16.307
figure out.
5 log (3 /10),

00:42:16.307 --> 00:42:23.752
which is 1/3,
which is equal to 5

00:42:23.752 --> 00:42:31.290
log(10^(-1/2)).
3 = 10^(1/2);

00:42:31.290 --> 00:42:39.260
1/3 = 10^(-1/2), which is - 5/2.
That 5 comes from here.

00:42:39.260 --> 00:42:45.394
The -1/2 comes from here.
So, M = 5/2,

00:42:45.394 --> 00:42:53.880
let's see, minus 5/4,
is equal to 5/4.

00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:58.580
And that is the absolute
magnitude.

00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:06.140
I'm sorry.
Oh you want me to do--okay,

00:43:06.140 --> 00:43:09.230
sure.
So, we okay to here?

00:43:09.230 --> 00:43:12.395
Student: [Inaudible]
Professor Charles

00:43:12.395 --> 00:43:14.820
Bailyn: So oh,
oh, okay, fine.

00:43:14.820 --> 00:43:17.780
Log of--this is actually an
important point.

00:43:17.780 --> 00:43:24.046
Log(1/3), that's what we're
going to try and do,

00:43:24.046 --> 00:43:31.935
is equal to log (1/10^(1/2)).
1/10^(n) =

00:43:31.935 --> 00:43:36.670
10^(-n).
That's the key thing.

00:43:36.670 --> 00:43:43.146
And so, this is the log of 10
to the minus one half

00:43:43.146 --> 00:43:48.844
[log(10^(-1/2))]
That, then, means that 5 log

00:43:48.844 --> 00:43:54.480
(1/3) = 5 x (-1/2) = - 5/2.
Yes?

00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:56.973
Student: [Inaudible]
Professor Charles

00:43:56.973 --> 00:43:59.943
Bailyn: There are no
units--yeah, magnitudes are just

00:43:59.943 --> 00:44:01.860
numbers.
Yes?

00:44:01.860 --> 00:44:06.428
Student: [Inaudible]
Professor Charles

00:44:06.428 --> 00:44:10.218
Bailyn: Ah,
well, what I did--sorry,

00:44:10.218 --> 00:44:14.090
I skipped a step.
To start from that.

00:44:14.090 --> 00:44:23.440
-5/4 - M = -5/2.
So, I multiply both sides by

00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:31.300
negative 1, then I subtract 5/4
from both sides.

00:44:31.300 --> 00:44:32.800
You got to keep the minus signs
straight.

00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:34.973
The easiest way to make
mistakes in this is to get the

00:44:34.973 --> 00:44:37.639
thing upside down and lose track
of where your minus signs are,

00:44:37.639 --> 00:44:40.567
which is really easy to do,
because the whole scale is

00:44:40.567 --> 00:44:42.881
backwards.
So, you know,

00:44:42.881 --> 00:44:47.710
-5/4 is bright,
whereas 5/4 is faint.

00:44:47.710 --> 00:44:50.905
And so, you're--one is
constantly getting these things

00:44:50.905 --> 00:44:53.070
upside down.
Be careful.

00:44:53.070 --> 00:44:55.800
Look at your answers to see it
makes sense.

00:44:55.800 --> 00:45:00.403
If some incredibly faint galaxy
turns out to have a magnitude of

00:45:00.403 --> 00:45:04.349
-50, that's almost certainly
wrong, because that's much

00:45:04.349 --> 00:45:07.860
brighter than the Sun.
All right.

00:45:07.860 --> 00:45:11.311
So, now.
Now, we can actually do the

00:45:11.311 --> 00:45:19.679
Standard Candle Method.
Here's the key problem.

00:45:19.679 --> 00:45:26.259
If you observe a star like
Sirius and you--I don't know,

00:45:26.259 --> 00:45:30.951
you take its spectrum,
or some alien comes down and

00:45:30.951 --> 00:45:35.114
tells you this star is just like
Sirius, or however you work this

00:45:35.114 --> 00:45:39.009
out.
If you observe a star like

00:45:39.009 --> 00:45:45.889
Sirius and measure its apparent
magnitude to be 8.75,

00:45:45.889 --> 00:45:48.800
how far away is it?

00:45:52.869 --> 00:45:55.799
And now, we're back to where we
were twenty minutes ago,

00:45:55.799 --> 00:45:57.769
before I started all this
nonsense.

00:45:57.769 --> 00:46:01.889
Namely, we're trying to measure
the distance of something,

00:46:01.889 --> 00:46:05.430
which was the whole purpose,
as you may recall.

00:46:05.430 --> 00:46:10.070
So, how far away is it?
Let's see.

00:46:10.070 --> 00:46:17.260
m - M = 5 log
(D /10 parsecs).

00:46:17.260 --> 00:46:24.014
The apparent magnitude is 8.75.
The absolute magnitude,

00:46:24.014 --> 00:46:29.390
we just figured out,
is 5/4--1.25--is equal to 5 log

00:46:29.390 --> 00:46:32.965
(D / 10 pc).
And you'll notice I've chosen

00:46:32.965 --> 00:46:35.130
my numbers carefully,
because this is going to work

00:46:35.130 --> 00:46:37.253
out well.
This is 7.5,

00:46:37.253 --> 00:46:42.730
and I'm going to divide both
sides by 5;

00:46:42.730 --> 00:46:48.159
7.5 / 5 = log (D / 10
pc).

00:46:48.159 --> 00:46:54.330
Or, 1.5 = log (D / 10
pc).

00:46:54.330 --> 00:46:59.380
Now what do I do?
Yeah, exactly.

00:46:59.380 --> 00:47:03.730
You have to take 10 to the
power of both sides.

00:47:03.730 --> 00:47:06.447
Whenever you're stuck with log
of something and you don't want

00:47:06.447 --> 00:47:10.628
the log of the something,
you want the actual something

00:47:10.628 --> 00:47:15.455
itself, what you got to do is
10^(1.5) = 10^(log

00:47:15.455 --> 00:47:19.092
(D/10pc)).
Ten to the log of anything is

00:47:19.092 --> 00:47:23.130
equal to itself.
So, this is D / 10

00:47:23.130 --> 00:47:28.390
parsecs.
And thus, what's 10^(1.5)?

00:47:28.390 --> 00:47:30.138
Student: Thirty.
Professor Charles

00:47:30.138 --> 00:47:31.199
Bailyn: Thirty,
yes.

00:47:31.199 --> 00:47:39.920
10^(1.5) = 10^(1) x 10^(1/2) =
3 x 10^(1) = 30.

00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:46.913
So, 30 = D / 10 parsecs.
And D is equal to 300

00:47:46.913 --> 00:47:49.710
parsecs.
And for the person who asked

00:47:49.710 --> 00:47:52.289
about units, which was a very
good question,

00:47:52.289 --> 00:47:54.510
this is where the units come
back.

00:47:54.510 --> 00:47:58.309
It's because there's this 10
parsecs embedded inside the

00:47:58.309 --> 00:48:02.449
equation.
And so, the unit of length

00:48:02.449 --> 00:48:06.272
comes back here.
And so, that's how you measure

00:48:06.272 --> 00:48:08.812
distance.
You know how bright something

00:48:08.812 --> 00:48:13.370
is, probably by having looked at
some other, more nearby example.

00:48:13.370 --> 00:48:18.395
You measure how bright it looks.
You compare those two things,

00:48:18.395 --> 00:48:21.553
and out pops the distance.
So, this is done,

00:48:21.553 --> 00:48:26.192
usually, in the form of what's
called the distance ladder,

00:48:26.192 --> 00:48:30.179
which we will talk about much
more in section.

00:48:30.179 --> 00:48:32.389
So, you'll get many more
opportunities to do this.

00:48:32.389 --> 00:48:35.517
Nearby stars,
you measure the distance in

00:48:35.517 --> 00:48:38.410
parallax--from the parallax
method.

00:48:43.510 --> 00:48:51.170
Then you find examples of
similar stars.

00:48:51.170 --> 00:48:59.610
You measure the apparent
magnitude.

00:48:59.610 --> 00:49:03.576
You assume the absolute
magnitude to be the same as the

00:49:03.576 --> 00:49:07.835
absolute magnitude for things
you already know the distance

00:49:07.835 --> 00:49:10.217
to.
You assume the absolute

00:49:10.217 --> 00:49:16.480
magnitude.
And you compute the distance.

00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:24.524
This, then, gets you new--this
tells you that you learned from

00:49:24.524 --> 00:49:31.250
this, the absolute magnitudes of
brighter things.

00:49:31.250 --> 00:49:33.500
Not just stars,
but whole galaxies,

00:49:33.500 --> 00:49:36.677
supernovae, all sorts of
things--brighter things,

00:49:36.677 --> 00:49:39.590
which you can then measure
further away.

00:49:45.679 --> 00:49:49.819
And just to conclude,
you can see pretty clearly that

00:49:49.819 --> 00:49:53.719
this method is fraught with
potential problems.

00:49:53.719 --> 00:50:02.922
Because every time you go
through this--you know,

00:50:02.922 --> 00:50:11.640
that's a swear word in science.
You're making an assumption,

00:50:11.640 --> 00:50:15.139
and that assumption can lead
you astray.

00:50:15.139 --> 00:50:19.573
And so, the whole history of
cosmology, since 1925,

00:50:19.573 --> 00:50:23.188
is in that word.
Assuming the absolute magnitude

00:50:23.188 --> 00:50:27.030
of things for which you're
trying to measure the distance,

00:50:27.030 --> 00:50:29.430
so you can put them on the
Hubble Diagram,

00:50:29.430 --> 00:50:33.119
so that you can deduce the rate
of expansion of the Universe,

00:50:33.119 --> 00:50:35.780
and thus its age and ultimate
fate.

00:50:35.780 --> 00:50:40.177
So, it all rests on this little
point embedded inside the

00:50:40.177 --> 00:50:44.025
Standard Candle Method,
which will be discussed at

00:50:44.025 --> 00:50:48.000
great length.
Okay, that's it for today.

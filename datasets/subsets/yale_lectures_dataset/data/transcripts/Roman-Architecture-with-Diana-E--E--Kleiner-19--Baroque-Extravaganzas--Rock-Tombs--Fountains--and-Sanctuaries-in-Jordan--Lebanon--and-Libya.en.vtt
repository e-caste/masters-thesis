00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:03.540
Prof: Good morning
everybody.

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.812
Today I am going to--well
actually let me step back for a

00:00:08.812 --> 00:00:09.660
second.
 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.562
I have been mentioning to you,
in the last several weeks I've

00:00:12.562 --> 00:00:14.846
been mentioning to you,
more than once,

00:00:14.846 --> 00:00:18.419
the fact that we are--
we have been beginning to see

00:00:18.419 --> 00:00:21.867
what I've described as the
baroque element in Roman

00:00:21.867 --> 00:00:25.106
architecture,
the baroque element in Roman

00:00:25.106 --> 00:00:26.140
architecture.
 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.575
And I want to concentrate on
that particular aspect of Roman

00:00:30.575 --> 00:00:33.736
architecture today,
which is why I've called the

00:00:33.736 --> 00:00:36.050
lecture "Baroque
Extravaganzas."

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.937
I want to make--at the
beginning, at the outset,

00:00:38.937 --> 00:00:40.780
I want to make a few points.
 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:46.086
I want to highlight what I see
as the three major features of

00:00:46.086 --> 00:00:49.890
baroque architecture in the
Roman period.

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.267
The first of these is that
those buildings that are

00:00:53.267 --> 00:00:55.779
baroque,
or at least the architects and

00:00:55.779 --> 00:00:59.022
patrons who designed buildings
that we think of today as

00:00:59.022 --> 00:01:01.066
Baroque,
or we might define as Baroque

00:01:01.066 --> 00:01:04.903
buildings,
they used the traditional

00:01:04.903 --> 00:01:09.715
vocabulary of architecture;
they used the traditional

00:01:09.715 --> 00:01:10.989
vocabulary of architecture.
 

00:01:10.989 --> 00:01:14.608
And by that I mean the
traditional vocabulary of Greek

00:01:14.608 --> 00:01:17.819
and Etruscan architecture,
for the most part.

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:21.626
I'm speaking now of columns,
I'm speaking of pediments,

00:01:21.626 --> 00:01:25.575
and I'm also speaking of
lintels and entablatures and the

00:01:25.575 --> 00:01:26.209
like.
 

00:01:26.209 --> 00:01:29.224
They use all of that
traditional vocabulary,

00:01:29.224 --> 00:01:32.170
but they use it in a very
different way.

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:33.379
That's number one.
 

00:01:33.379 --> 00:01:39.141
Number two is that ancient
Roman baroque buildings tend to

00:01:39.141 --> 00:01:45.310
be decorated in a very ornate
fashion -- almost too ornate.

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.385
In fact, we'll see that these
buildings are covered with

00:01:48.385 --> 00:01:51.197
decoration,
so much so that they seem to

00:01:51.197 --> 00:01:54.890
dematerialize some of the
architectural elements,

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.782
including those ones that make
up that traditional vocabulary

00:01:58.782 --> 00:01:59.950
of architecture.
 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.840
The third, and in some respects
the most important,

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.507
is the fact that they use these
traditional elements of

00:02:08.507 --> 00:02:11.506
architecture to--
they use them in a way to

00:02:11.506 --> 00:02:13.716
enliven the surface,
to create motion,

00:02:13.716 --> 00:02:15.688
to create a sense of
undulation.

00:02:15.688 --> 00:02:19.066
And that in and out,
the in-and-out projection and

00:02:19.066 --> 00:02:22.650
recession that I've mentioned on
a few occasions,

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.848
we see that interjected into
these works of architecture of

00:02:26.848 --> 00:02:29.020
the so-called Baroque style.
 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.596
So keep those three
characteristics in mind,

00:02:32.596 --> 00:02:36.090
as we look at a host of
buildings today.

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.798
I also want to mention that
we'll focus primarily today on

00:02:39.798 --> 00:02:43.774
the eastern part of the Empire,
where we see a particularly

00:02:43.774 --> 00:02:46.520
large number of these baroque
buildings,

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.460
in large part because there was
a strong tradition in that part

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:53.764
of the world for using that
traditional vocabulary of

00:02:53.764 --> 00:02:56.565
architecture,
because of the very strong

00:02:56.565 --> 00:02:59.430
impact of Greece and of Greek
architecture,

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:05.919
and of access to high quality
marble,

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:10.122
from that part of the world,
which of course is needed for

00:03:10.122 --> 00:03:11.818
columns and the like.
 

00:03:11.818 --> 00:03:15.878
So we'll focus on the eastern
part of the Empire.

00:03:15.878 --> 00:03:20.306
I also want to make the point
that when one thinks about

00:03:20.306 --> 00:03:24.282
Baroque architecture,
in general, one thinks not of

00:03:24.282 --> 00:03:27.610
Roman antiquity,
but rather of the seventeenth

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:28.889
century in Italy.
 

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:32.631
One thinks, in particular,
of two master architects,

00:03:32.631 --> 00:03:37.105
two great architectural giants,
who were on the world stage at

00:03:37.105 --> 00:03:38.940
that particular time.
 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.629
And that is Bernini,
Gian Lorenzo Bernini,

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:49.580
and also Francesco Borromini,
Francesco Borromini;

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:53.139
Bernini and Borromini,
who were themselves rivals,

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:56.869
architectural rivals;
put up buildings in fact that

00:03:56.869 --> 00:03:59.710
are often in dialogue with one
another.

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:01.930
I think in particular of the
Piazza Navona,

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.860
where we have Bernini's Four
Rivers Fountain,

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:10.408
and Borromini's Church of
Sant'Agnese there in Agone,

00:04:10.408 --> 00:04:14.468
and the way in which they were
set up to speak to one another.

00:04:14.468 --> 00:04:16.879
I don't know if any of you--I'm
sure many of you know the Four

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:19.353
Rivers Fountain,
where one of the rivers has his

00:04:19.353 --> 00:04:22.350
hand up,
like this, to protect himself.

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:25.740
And the implication is he needs
to protect himself;

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.398
he's facing Bernini's building,
he's facing--excuse me,

00:04:29.398 --> 00:04:33.057
he's facing Borromini's church,
and he needs to protect

00:04:33.057 --> 00:04:35.545
himself;
that is, Bernini's river needs

00:04:35.545 --> 00:04:38.060
to protect himself from
Borromini's church,

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.269
the implication being that if
he doesn't--

00:04:40.269 --> 00:04:43.083
he needs to hold up his hand
because Borromini's church is

00:04:43.083 --> 00:04:46.589
going to collapse,
because it's so poorly executed.

00:04:46.589 --> 00:04:50.120
So this very interesting
dialogue between the two men.

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.322
And again we think of that
primarily when we think of

00:04:53.322 --> 00:04:53.940
Baroque.
 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:55.509
And just a couple of examples.
 

00:04:55.509 --> 00:04:58.702
I show here--and I'll show you
a number of them in the course

00:04:58.702 --> 00:05:01.622
of the lecture today,
especially Borromini's

00:05:01.622 --> 00:05:05.581
work--but I wanted to focus
right at the moment on St.

00:05:05.581 --> 00:05:07.300
Peter's, San Pietro.
 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:08.692
You see it here,
St.

00:05:08.692 --> 00:05:13.088
Peter's as designed--the dome
is designed, as we've discussed

00:05:13.088 --> 00:05:15.139
before, by Michelangelo.
 

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:17.999
The façade design by
Carlo Maderno,

00:05:17.999 --> 00:05:20.720
also a seventeenth-century
architect.

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:25.995
But most interesting are the
embracing oval arms of Bernini's

00:05:25.995 --> 00:05:27.050
colonnade.
 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:30.269
And you can see that so well in
the view on the upper left,

00:05:30.269 --> 00:05:32.600
the embracing arms of that
colonnade,

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:36.696
and all the motion and the
in-and-out movement that we find

00:05:36.696 --> 00:05:40.440
both on the façade and in
the embracing arms is

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.547
characteristic of
seventeenth-century Baroque

00:05:43.547 --> 00:05:44.889
architecture.
 

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:47.644
But I want to maintain today,
as I've maintained in the

00:05:47.644 --> 00:05:49.785
course of the semester,
that the Romans,

00:05:49.785 --> 00:05:52.639
there wasn't anything that the
Romans didn't do first,

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:56.290
and that it is Roman baroque
architecture,

00:05:56.290 --> 00:06:00.682
as we're going to define it
today, that had a huge impact on

00:06:00.682 --> 00:06:03.660
architects like Borromini and
Bernini.

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:06.560
And I remind you of a couple of
instances of that.

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.892
Think back;
the whole idea of using

00:06:08.892 --> 00:06:12.127
hemicycles,
curves in architecture is begun

00:06:12.127 --> 00:06:15.728
by the Romans,
of course, in such buildings as

00:06:15.728 --> 00:06:19.720
the Sanctuary of Fortuna
Primigenia at Palestrina,

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:22.089
where you see one of the
hemicycles up there.

00:06:22.089 --> 00:06:25.288
And you'll remember that from
our discussion of the paper

00:06:25.288 --> 00:06:28.009
topics,
that in Gerasa there was an

00:06:28.009 --> 00:06:33.961
oval piazza or oval forum,
well before the oval colonnade

00:06:33.961 --> 00:06:35.449
of Bernini.
 

00:06:35.449 --> 00:06:39.353
So again, what I'm going to try
to demonstrate today is how

00:06:39.353 --> 00:06:42.920
important this baroque
architecture in Roman antiquity

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:45.447
is,
not only in its own right,

00:06:45.447 --> 00:06:49.574
but also as a model and a spur
to the architects of the

00:06:49.574 --> 00:06:52.019
seventeenth century in Italy.
 

00:06:52.019 --> 00:06:57.766
We have touched upon the
beginnings of Roman baroque

00:06:57.766 --> 00:07:00.985
architecture--
incipient, we might call it

00:07:00.985 --> 00:07:03.029
incipient Roman baroque
architecture--

00:07:03.029 --> 00:07:04.778
in a few instances.
 

00:07:04.778 --> 00:07:07.149
And I just want to remind you
of those today.

00:07:07.149 --> 00:07:10.670
Think back to Second Style
Roman wall painting.

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:14.430
I remind you of the Room of the
Masks in the House of Augustus,

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:18.149
where you see this theatrical
façade,

00:07:18.149 --> 00:07:22.865
done in paint,
that represents columns with

00:07:22.865 --> 00:07:28.370
projecting elements or lintels
on either side,

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:31.839
and then a kind of a pediment
up above.

00:07:31.839 --> 00:07:36.103
We saw our first explorations
of this kind of thing in

00:07:36.103 --> 00:07:40.848
painting, already in 60 to 50
B.C., and then in this case in

00:07:40.848 --> 00:07:42.699
the '30s to 20 B.C.
 

00:07:42.699 --> 00:07:46.312
And we maintained at that point
that there was probably a direct

00:07:46.312 --> 00:07:49.867
relationship between theatrical
architecture and these kinds of

00:07:49.867 --> 00:07:50.670
paintings.
 

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:53.490
But we don't have much in the
way of preserved,

00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:57.233
built architecture at that time
that partakes of some of these

00:07:57.233 --> 00:07:58.459
characteristics.
 

00:07:58.459 --> 00:08:01.480
But we think it's possible that
there may have been,

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:03.892
as I mentioned then,
some wooden,

00:08:03.892 --> 00:08:08.110
some scaenae frons,
with these kinds of effects

00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:11.220
done in wood,
that no longer survive today.

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:15.538
You'll remember also that we
looked at the Forum Transitorium

00:08:15.538 --> 00:08:19.639
in Rome: the forum first of
Domitian and then completed by

00:08:19.639 --> 00:08:20.360
Nerva.
 

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:22.209
And I show you a detail of that
again.

00:08:22.209 --> 00:08:25.204
And this is when we really
begin to see,

00:08:25.204 --> 00:08:28.968
in built architecture,
this move toward what we're

00:08:28.968 --> 00:08:33.269
defining today as the baroque in
Roman architecture.

00:08:33.269 --> 00:08:37.178
And you can see that what we
have here are the traditional,

00:08:37.178 --> 00:08:39.405
the traditional vocabulary of
architecture:

00:08:39.405 --> 00:08:41.389
columns,
in this case Corinthian

00:08:41.389 --> 00:08:44.250
columns, with projecting
entablatures on top,

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:50.292
creating a system of receding
and progressing bays across the

00:08:50.292 --> 00:08:53.100
surface,
which created a kind of

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:56.870
undulating movement across the
sides of the forum.

00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:59.779
And then you'll remember also,
if you look at the frieze,

00:08:59.779 --> 00:09:04.427
that the frieze continues along
the sides of the columns as

00:09:04.427 --> 00:09:07.364
well,
and then in a relief of

00:09:07.364 --> 00:09:09.360
Minerva, up on top.
 

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:13.313
It's not quite--I wouldn't call
it overly ornate quite yet,

00:09:13.313 --> 00:09:14.610
but it is ornate.
 

00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:17.197
And you'll remember that during
the Flavian period,

00:09:17.197 --> 00:09:19.370
for example,
there was a lot of interest in

00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:20.509
ornate decoration.
 

00:09:20.509 --> 00:09:23.990
So we're beginning to see some
exploration of this kind of

00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:24.480
thing.
 

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:28.691
And then it comes full-blown,
in the early third century

00:09:28.691 --> 00:09:32.365
A.D., the Septizodium,
the façade that was

00:09:32.365 --> 00:09:37.419
designed for Septimius Severus
to add to the Palatine Palace,

00:09:37.419 --> 00:09:40.977
that had been built by Domitian;
this incredible façade

00:09:40.977 --> 00:09:43.610
that is more show than anything
else.

00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:45.519
We think it may also have
served as a fountain,

00:09:45.519 --> 00:09:47.917
as I mentioned,
very much looking like a

00:09:47.917 --> 00:09:51.510
theater set,
with three very large niches,

00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:55.779
columns on the curve,
and then a series of columns,

00:09:55.779 --> 00:09:59.456
placed in three tiers,
with wings on either side,

00:09:59.456 --> 00:10:03.538
and we have a sense that this
too was quite decorative.

00:10:03.538 --> 00:10:06.340
So all of those elements:
the use of the traditional

00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:09.360
language of architecture,
columns, lintels and so on;

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:13.399
an interest in a very
decorative surface;

00:10:13.399 --> 00:10:18.413
and then above all this
interjection of motion into the

00:10:18.413 --> 00:10:20.486
structure--
projecting bay,

00:10:20.486 --> 00:10:22.278
receding bay,
projecting bay,

00:10:22.278 --> 00:10:26.075
receding bay--all using the
traditional language of

00:10:26.075 --> 00:10:28.745
architecture,
the traditional vocabulary of

00:10:28.745 --> 00:10:31.470
architecture,
namely columns and the like.

00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:36.046
Then I also showed you the
tomb, the second-century Tomb of

00:10:36.046 --> 00:10:39.440
the Caetennii,
under the Vatican in Rome.

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:43.551
And we looked at this
axonometric view in Ward-Perkins

00:10:43.551 --> 00:10:47.428
showing the brick-faced concrete
façade,

00:10:47.428 --> 00:10:52.350
with the exposed brick that was
popular at that time.

00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:55.710
But we focused in on the
interior of the structure,

00:10:55.710 --> 00:11:00.778
where I mentioned that through
architectonic means the

00:11:00.778 --> 00:11:06.706
architects had embellished this
surface and created interesting

00:11:06.706 --> 00:11:09.288
motion in that surface.
 

00:11:09.288 --> 00:11:12.509
And you see here this same idea
of split--

00:11:12.509 --> 00:11:14.928
as we see in the paintings of
the Second Style,

00:11:14.928 --> 00:11:19.225
a triangular pediment has been
split apart to reveal another

00:11:19.225 --> 00:11:22.140
triangular pediment inside,
with a niche,

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:24.335
as you can see,
and the rest of the wall

00:11:24.335 --> 00:11:25.908
embellished with columns.
 

00:11:25.908 --> 00:11:29.484
So once again this sense of
in-and-out movement,

00:11:29.484 --> 00:11:32.450
across the sides of that
wall--walls.

00:11:32.450 --> 00:11:35.490
And here you see a view of it
as it looks today.

00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:38.240
The columns and so on are no
longer there,

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:41.210
but you can reconstruct them in
your mind's eye,

00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:44.566
underneath these capitals,
and get a very good sense of

00:11:44.566 --> 00:11:48.552
this articulation;
what we might call a kind of

00:11:48.552 --> 00:11:51.980
baroque articulation of the
walls.

00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:56.352
I mentioned already that most
of our best examples of Roman,

00:11:56.352 --> 00:12:00.282
ancient Roman baroque
architecture can be found in the

00:12:00.282 --> 00:12:02.580
eastern part of the Empire.
 

00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:04.778
And I'd like to concentrate on
those today;

00:12:04.778 --> 00:12:06.860
although we'll look--we won't
look at those exclusively.

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:10.970
I do have a couple of examples
from the West as well.

00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:15.698
I'm going to actually start in
the West, at a place called

00:12:15.698 --> 00:12:17.940
Santa Maria Capua Vetere.
 

00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:21.190
And I show it to you on the map
here.

00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:25.147
It is close to all the sites in
Campania that we've been talking

00:12:25.147 --> 00:12:26.528
about this semester.
 

00:12:26.528 --> 00:12:30.349
You see Pompeii and Herculaneum
and Oplontis and Baia,

00:12:30.349 --> 00:12:32.440
for example,
and Benevento.

00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:34.279
And over here Naples.
 

00:12:34.279 --> 00:12:38.559
And you can see the proximity
of Santa Maria Capua Vetere,

00:12:38.559 --> 00:12:41.940
to all of those that we've
already covered.

00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:46.306
And in Santa Maria Capua Vetere
has been found an extremely

00:12:46.306 --> 00:12:49.904
well-preserved Roman tomb,
and you see it here in the

00:12:49.904 --> 00:12:53.320
center of the screen --
a Roman tomb that dates to the

00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:57.399
late first century A.D. It is
very clear that it is made of

00:12:57.399 --> 00:13:00.706
concrete construction,
and that it is faced with

00:13:00.706 --> 00:13:04.433
opus incertum work,
which you can see here very

00:13:04.433 --> 00:13:05.629
clearly.
 

00:13:05.629 --> 00:13:09.469
But you can also see that some
brick has been used,

00:13:09.469 --> 00:13:12.155
around the niches,
and as a molding,

00:13:12.155 --> 00:13:16.840
both for these cylinders and
for the tholos above.

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:19.178
This has confused scholars.
 

00:13:19.178 --> 00:13:21.990
They don't know when to date
this;

00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:25.024
also because of these so-called
baroque characteristics where

00:13:25.024 --> 00:13:27.100
you see this undulating
façade,

00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:30.240
with the use of--well they're
not really columns,

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:33.065
they're more like cylinders,
and in that sense similar to

00:13:33.065 --> 00:13:35.789
the cylinders that we saw in the
Tomb of the Baker,

00:13:35.789 --> 00:13:36.879
these cylinders.
 

00:13:36.879 --> 00:13:38.710
But the undulating
façade,

00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:41.984
the use of architectural
elements, the interest in

00:13:41.984 --> 00:13:44.812
decoration,
and the cylinders,

00:13:44.812 --> 00:13:49.476
have confused scholars,
as I said, and they have been

00:13:49.476 --> 00:13:52.639
betwixt and between when to date
this thing.

00:13:52.639 --> 00:13:56.488
And some have said that it
dates at the time of such

00:13:56.488 --> 00:14:00.261
buildings as the Sanctuary of
Fortuna Primigenia at

00:14:00.261 --> 00:14:02.342
Palestrina,
because of the opus

00:14:02.342 --> 00:14:02.899
incertum.
 

00:14:02.899 --> 00:14:06.609
Others have said because of the
use of brick here--which we

00:14:06.609 --> 00:14:10.575
actually think in this case was
stuccoed over--that it might be

00:14:10.575 --> 00:14:12.428
later second century A.D.
 

00:14:12.428 --> 00:14:16.466
But this is actually more like
the tile brick that we saw in

00:14:16.466 --> 00:14:20.710
Pompeii, rather than the kind of
brick that we see in Ostia.

00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:24.832
So I favor the first-century
date, late first-century A.D.

00:14:24.832 --> 00:14:25.340
date.
 

00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:28.330
But we have to think of it as
very prescient of what is to

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:29.339
come,
experimenting,

00:14:29.339 --> 00:14:31.613
as did some of those other
buildings that I just showed

00:14:31.613 --> 00:14:33.217
you--
the Forum Transitorium,

00:14:33.217 --> 00:14:35.783
for example--
with the sort of thing that is

00:14:35.783 --> 00:14:39.312
going to become particularly
popular in the second and third

00:14:39.312 --> 00:14:40.330
centuries A.D.
 

00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:43.629
Now I juxtapose this tomb--and
by the way,

00:14:43.629 --> 00:14:45.340
this tomb, the nickname of this
tomb,

00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:47.269
as you can see from your
Monument List,

00:14:47.269 --> 00:14:49.070
is "La Conocchia."
 

00:14:49.070 --> 00:14:52.267
La Conocchia means "the
distaff,"

00:14:52.267 --> 00:14:55.692
and a distaff is used in
spinning and weaving,

00:14:55.692 --> 00:14:58.129
a spinning thread primarily.
 

00:14:58.129 --> 00:15:00.740
And it looks like an ancient
distaff.

00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:08.000
So that's how it got its
nickname, La Conocchia.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.830
Whether that means that that
was intended by the designers,

00:15:09.830 --> 00:15:13.850
and that this was a tomb of
perhaps a woman who was--

00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:18.899
or a man working in a factory
who spun thread.

00:15:18.899 --> 00:15:21.460
I think that's very
far-fetched, I think it's highly

00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:23.570
unlikely, but I just throw it
out there.

00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:25.740
But that is what its nickname
is.

00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:28.567
But you can see by the
juxtaposition of it with the

00:15:28.567 --> 00:15:32.076
Tomb of the Baker on the right,
and with the Monument of the

00:15:32.076 --> 00:15:34.740
Julii in Saint Rémy,
in the south of France--which

00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:37.914
we haven't looked at,
but which we will look at in a

00:15:37.914 --> 00:15:42.172
lecture next week on Roman
architecture in the south of

00:15:42.172 --> 00:15:45.753
France,
primarily--you will see that it

00:15:45.753 --> 00:15:48.730
makes reference to both of
these.

00:15:48.730 --> 00:15:49.799
Both of these are earlier.
 

00:15:49.799 --> 00:15:53.063
This is, as you know, Augustan;
the one on the left is from the

00:15:53.063 --> 00:15:54.889
late--the time of Julius Caesar.
 

00:15:54.889 --> 00:15:57.360
And you can see that it takes
elements--

00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:01.009
I'm not saying it looked at
these in particular,

00:16:01.009 --> 00:16:04.355
but just that these kinds of
elements were already in the air

00:16:04.355 --> 00:16:07.730
when this building was built,
in the late first century A.D.

00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:10.019
The great cylinders of the Tomb
of Eurysaces.

00:16:10.019 --> 00:16:14.096
But it is more similar actually
to this one, because the Julii

00:16:14.096 --> 00:16:18.105
Monument, and also La Conocchia,
are examples of what we call

00:16:18.105 --> 00:16:19.710
the tower-tomb type.
 

00:16:19.710 --> 00:16:23.548
The tower-tomb type is taller
than it is wide.

00:16:23.548 --> 00:16:26.662
It has a series of stories,
in this case a plain story,

00:16:26.662 --> 00:16:28.967
then a central story,
with the cylinders,

00:16:28.967 --> 00:16:31.389
and then the tholos at
the top.

00:16:31.389 --> 00:16:34.364
And we see the same sort of
thing in the Julii Monument:

00:16:34.364 --> 00:16:37.216
stepped base,
socle here with sculptural

00:16:37.216 --> 00:16:39.445
decoration,
a quadrifrons,

00:16:39.445 --> 00:16:43.240
and then a tholos at the
very apex.

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:48.009
But it's interesting to see the
differences between the two,

00:16:48.009 --> 00:16:51.205
because what we see in this
monument again is much more what

00:16:51.205 --> 00:16:54.056
we would call baroque,
in the sense that we have the

00:16:54.056 --> 00:16:57.485
undulating façade,
we have the use of what looked

00:16:57.485 --> 00:16:59.288
like,
in a general way,

00:16:59.288 --> 00:17:02.808
the traditional vocabulary of
architecture,

00:17:02.808 --> 00:17:05.150
with these cylinders,
with the niches,

00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:06.548
with the pediments.
 

00:17:06.548 --> 00:17:08.038
But look at the way the
tholos is treated.

00:17:08.038 --> 00:17:09.880
When you look at the
tholos in the Julii

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:11.726
Monument,
you see that it really does

00:17:11.726 --> 00:17:14.499
look like a shrine,
and it has statues inside,

00:17:14.499 --> 00:17:15.880
like a shrine would.
 

00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:19.640
This one has blind windows,
as you can see.

00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:22.700
You can't see into it;
there's nothing inside.

00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:26.077
So they're treating the
tholos more as a

00:17:26.077 --> 00:17:30.412
decorative motif than they are
treating it as something that

00:17:30.412 --> 00:17:34.525
has the purpose of holding some
either religious items or

00:17:34.525 --> 00:17:39.813
statues or honorific statues,
as it does in this particular

00:17:39.813 --> 00:17:40.358
case.
 

00:17:40.358 --> 00:17:44.954
Another view of La Conocchia,
a detail which I think shows

00:17:44.954 --> 00:17:49.711
you what I mean about motion
being introduced into monuments

00:17:49.711 --> 00:17:50.838
like this.
 

00:17:50.838 --> 00:17:54.160
In this case we are dealing
with concrete,

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:57.215
and that is somewhat different,
the use of concrete to create

00:17:57.215 --> 00:18:00.094
undulation,
than the use of the traditional

00:18:00.094 --> 00:18:02.048
vocabulary of architecture.
 

00:18:02.048 --> 00:18:05.240
But here we see a combination:
the concrete wall,

00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:07.160
faced with the opus
incertum,

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:10.181
the great cylinders on the
edge, and then the

00:18:10.181 --> 00:18:15.279
aedicula here,
with the pediment and the niche

00:18:15.279 --> 00:18:16.058
below.
 

00:18:16.058 --> 00:18:18.500
And you can also see very well
the cylinders that are located

00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:21.261
between the blind windows,
as well as this combination of

00:18:21.261 --> 00:18:26.198
opus incertum work,
and also the tile brick that is

00:18:26.198 --> 00:18:31.220
used to represent the moldings
and the like.

00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:35.999
I want to compare the central
zone of La Conocchia with a

00:18:35.999 --> 00:18:40.009
seventeenth-century Baroque
building in Rome.

00:18:40.009 --> 00:18:44.019
This is Francesco Borromini's
Sant'Ivo in Rome,

00:18:44.019 --> 00:18:48.452
taken from an angle that
accentuates the curvature of the

00:18:48.452 --> 00:18:51.952
façade,
and the contrast between the

00:18:51.952 --> 00:18:56.720
concavity of that curvature and
the convexity of the outside of

00:18:56.720 --> 00:19:00.519
the dome,
that you see up above -- the

00:19:00.519 --> 00:19:03.019
same sort of thing here.
 

00:19:03.019 --> 00:19:07.750
So once again architects of the
seventeenth century very much

00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:12.246
inspired by these kinds of
motifs that survived from Roman

00:19:12.246 --> 00:19:13.348
antiquity.
 

00:19:13.348 --> 00:19:16.214
On the left-hand side of the
screen--you'll all remember

00:19:16.214 --> 00:19:18.952
this;
this is the elliptical fountain

00:19:18.952 --> 00:19:23.240
from the Palace of Domitian on
the Palatine Hill that was

00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:25.036
located--
that he could see,

00:19:25.036 --> 00:19:27.884
through his window,
out of the triclinium,

00:19:27.884 --> 00:19:28.828
when he dined.
 

00:19:28.828 --> 00:19:31.977
And you'll remember here also
in this case made out of

00:19:31.977 --> 00:19:34.710
concrete construction,
designed by Rabirius.

00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:38.832
You see the elliptical wall and
the convexity of that elliptical

00:19:38.832 --> 00:19:41.423
wall;
the central element also

00:19:41.423 --> 00:19:45.779
convex, but with these
interesting concavities,

00:19:45.779 --> 00:19:49.098
scallops, that Rabirius has
created,

00:19:49.098 --> 00:19:53.298
through concrete faced with
brick around the structure.

00:19:53.298 --> 00:19:57.179
So in that case--all I'm trying
to do here is show you that you

00:19:57.179 --> 00:20:00.682
can create similar effects,
either in concrete or through

00:20:00.682 --> 00:20:02.308
columnar architecture.
 

00:20:02.308 --> 00:20:05.637
But what separates
revolutionary concrete

00:20:05.637 --> 00:20:08.573
architecture,
as we've discussed it today,

00:20:08.573 --> 00:20:11.798
and baroque architecture,
as I'm going to define it this

00:20:11.798 --> 00:20:14.105
morning,
is that in baroque architecture

00:20:14.105 --> 00:20:16.190
they're relying on the
traditional--

00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:19.172
not on concrete--but on the
traditional vocabulary of

00:20:19.172 --> 00:20:20.969
architecture--
namely, of course,

00:20:20.969 --> 00:20:22.630
columns, pediments and the
like--

00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:24.130
to create their effects.
 

00:20:24.130 --> 00:20:27.929
A place where it all comes
together you'll recall is at

00:20:27.929 --> 00:20:29.900
Hadrian's Villa at Tivoli.
 

00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:32.028
We're looking here at the
Piazza d'Oro,

00:20:32.028 --> 00:20:35.348
a plan of the Piazza d' Oro:
the octagonal vestibule,

00:20:35.348 --> 00:20:38.608
the great open rectangular
space that you can see here,

00:20:38.608 --> 00:20:42.720
and then the aula or the
audience hall on the far right.

00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:46.625
And you'll remember the
aula had these wonderful

00:20:46.625 --> 00:20:48.000
undulating walls.
 

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.037
But what separated the
aula from other

00:20:50.037 --> 00:20:52.768
undulating walls that we had
seen earlier is that it was not

00:20:52.768 --> 00:20:55.818
done with concrete,
but was done with columns.

00:20:55.818 --> 00:20:59.704
You'll remember the columns
were placed in such a way that

00:20:59.704 --> 00:21:03.521
they followed the curved shape,
and then they supported a

00:21:03.521 --> 00:21:04.750
concrete dome.
 

00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:09.030
So this wonderful combination
of the use of traditional

00:21:09.030 --> 00:21:12.996
language of architecture,
along an undulating form,

00:21:12.996 --> 00:21:16.009
and then with concrete at the
top.

00:21:16.009 --> 00:21:18.084
So we can see already in the
Hadrianic period further

00:21:18.084 --> 00:21:19.519
exploration of this kind of
thing.

00:21:19.519 --> 00:21:23.913
I also want to show you a very
interesting painting,

00:21:23.913 --> 00:21:27.704
painted room,
and this is in the House of the

00:21:27.704 --> 00:21:29.858
Labyrinth at Pompeii.
 

00:21:29.858 --> 00:21:33.150
It's early in date;
it dates to 50 B.C.

00:21:33.150 --> 00:21:34.849
But it's an extraordinary room.
 

00:21:34.849 --> 00:21:38.038
It's the atrium of the house.
 

00:21:38.038 --> 00:21:39.568
And we talked about several
different kinds of atria.

00:21:39.568 --> 00:21:43.122
We talked about the atrium that
had no columns at all,

00:21:43.122 --> 00:21:46.808
and we talked about the
tetrastyle atrium which had four

00:21:46.808 --> 00:21:49.288
columns around the central
basin.

00:21:49.288 --> 00:21:54.577
What you see here are a host of
columns surrounding that central

00:21:54.577 --> 00:21:55.250
basin.
 

00:21:55.250 --> 00:21:58.878
And when you have a number of
columns like this,

00:21:58.878 --> 00:22:02.353
more than four,
we call it a Corinthian atrium

00:22:02.353 --> 00:22:06.058
-- a Corinthian atrium with lots
of columns.

00:22:06.058 --> 00:22:09.885
And what you can see the artist
and patron have done here is to

00:22:09.885 --> 00:22:13.465
orchestrate the relationship of
those real columns with the

00:22:13.465 --> 00:22:16.798
fictive architecture that is
painted on the wall,

00:22:16.798 --> 00:22:20.297
and to play them up in such a
way that as you're standing in

00:22:20.297 --> 00:22:23.854
the room you are looking through
the real columns to see this

00:22:23.854 --> 00:22:27.292
view that lies behind of a
tholos which you can view

00:22:27.292 --> 00:22:30.019
through the broken triangular
pediments.

00:22:30.019 --> 00:22:32.618
I show it to you for a couple
of reasons: one,

00:22:32.618 --> 00:22:35.906
just to remind you that we saw
this kind of thing in painting

00:22:35.906 --> 00:22:38.099
very early on:
this is again 50 B.C.,

00:22:38.099 --> 00:22:42.038
in the Republic still.
 

00:22:42.038 --> 00:22:44.438
As we see, the architects
taking the traditional

00:22:44.438 --> 00:22:46.990
vocabulary of architecture and
playing with it,

00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:49.634
breaking it up,
opening it and revealing

00:22:49.634 --> 00:22:55.048
something that lies behind,
in this case the tholos.

00:22:55.048 --> 00:22:57.690
But look also at the way in
which the tholos looks

00:22:57.690 --> 00:22:59.009
like it's in the distance.
 

00:22:59.009 --> 00:23:01.432
You get the sense that you are
looking through an opening in

00:23:01.432 --> 00:23:03.940
the wall, a window in which you
can see that tholos.

00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:09.019
It seems to lie behind the
broken triangular pediment.

00:23:09.019 --> 00:23:11.240
The pediment has been broken
open to allow you to see a vista

00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:12.730
that lies behind,
and you get the sense,

00:23:12.730 --> 00:23:15.175
as you look at this painting,
that the tholos is

00:23:15.175 --> 00:23:18.633
surrounded by a peristyle,
and that there's also some

00:23:18.633 --> 00:23:20.828
greenery and so on out there.
 

00:23:20.828 --> 00:23:23.771
And then to accentuate this
idea of the view through the

00:23:23.771 --> 00:23:25.983
wall,
they have then added the

00:23:25.983 --> 00:23:28.778
columns here,
so that you're looking through

00:23:28.778 --> 00:23:30.807
real columns,
to fictive columns,

00:23:30.807 --> 00:23:35.336
to broken triangular pediment,
to the tholos that lies

00:23:35.336 --> 00:23:36.009
behind.
 

00:23:36.009 --> 00:23:40.267
You'll see the relevance of
this when we look at some

00:23:40.267 --> 00:23:42.150
additional monuments.
 

00:23:42.150 --> 00:23:46.166
I want to move--I want to now
go now east to look at some of

00:23:46.166 --> 00:23:49.980
the most spectacular examples
that survive of what we are

00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:53.930
calling baroque architecture in
Roman antiquity today.

00:23:53.930 --> 00:23:59.730
And I want to begin in a site
that is in modern Jordan.

00:23:59.730 --> 00:24:02.788
I'm showing you a map of the
Eastern Roman Empire,

00:24:02.788 --> 00:24:06.068
and we see the site in
question, Petra,

00:24:06.068 --> 00:24:08.369
or some say Petra:
you can call it either one,

00:24:08.369 --> 00:24:09.538
Petra or Petra.
 

00:24:09.538 --> 00:24:15.220
You see Petra over here,
which is in Jordan today.

00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:17.910
And you can see its
relationship to the Red Sea,

00:24:17.910 --> 00:24:22.818
to Egypt, to Alexandria,
to Judaea,

00:24:22.818 --> 00:24:25.242
modern Israel,
and to some of these other

00:24:25.242 --> 00:24:26.500
sites --
one, in fact,

00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:28.500
a couple of others that we'll
look at,

00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:31.509
Baalbek, today,
and the site of Gerasa,

00:24:31.509 --> 00:24:35.750
which is where that oval pizza
or forum comes from.

00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:39.185
Here's another map of Petra,
just to show you where it is

00:24:39.185 --> 00:24:41.173
located today,
within Jordan,

00:24:41.173 --> 00:24:44.699
its relationship to Amman,
and to the ancient site of

00:24:44.699 --> 00:24:47.343
Gerasa --
as you can see up at the

00:24:47.343 --> 00:24:51.118
bottom, fairly close to the
Israeli border,

00:24:51.118 --> 00:24:54.430
as you can see,
as well as to Aqaba down below.

00:24:54.430 --> 00:25:00.480
Just to get you in the mood for
Petra, we are walking here.

00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:04.041
There are incredible cliffs
here, as well as desert,

00:25:04.041 --> 00:25:07.394
incredible cliffs,
and we're walking here through

00:25:07.394 --> 00:25:10.048
what is known as the Siq in
Petra.

00:25:10.048 --> 00:25:13.459
And I want to mention that this
is one of those interesting

00:25:13.459 --> 00:25:16.926
provinces where in order to
understand the architecture that

00:25:16.926 --> 00:25:19.220
was built during the Roman
period,

00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:21.900
you have to have a sense of the
local customs,

00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:25.143
of what happened here before,
the buildings that were built

00:25:25.143 --> 00:25:26.710
prior to the Roman period.
 

00:25:26.710 --> 00:25:29.269
And we know that the so-called
Nabataeans--

00:25:29.269 --> 00:25:35.538
n-a-b-a-t, nabat,
n-a-b-a-t, Nabataeans,

00:25:35.538 --> 00:25:40.392
a-e-a-n-s, Nabataeans--lived
here, inhabited this part of the

00:25:40.392 --> 00:25:43.400
world,
before the Romans got there.

00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:46.631
And we know that the Nabataeans
built architecture,

00:25:46.631 --> 00:25:49.732
and that they built
architecture primarily out of

00:25:49.732 --> 00:25:52.900
the stone of the cliffs,
and also out of mud.

00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:57.195
And one can imagine the kinds
of things that you see here,

00:25:57.195 --> 00:26:00.436
the rock-cut tombs,
already begun during the

00:26:00.436 --> 00:26:02.019
Nabataean period.
 

00:26:02.019 --> 00:26:05.826
And it's interesting,
if you look very closely at

00:26:05.826 --> 00:26:09.000
some of the detailed decoration
here,

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.935
you can see something that any
of you who wrote your paper on

00:26:10.935 --> 00:26:12.259
the Temple of Bel at Palmyra
remember,

00:26:12.259 --> 00:26:15.858
the sort of stepped,
the stepped motif decoration.

00:26:15.858 --> 00:26:19.048
We see the same sort of thing
here.

00:26:19.048 --> 00:26:22.313
But just important for you to
know that the Nabataeans were

00:26:22.313 --> 00:26:25.690
building with stone and with mud
before the Roman period,

00:26:25.690 --> 00:26:29.891
and so when the Romans came in
and began to build their own

00:26:29.891 --> 00:26:32.871
architecture,
obviously the impact of what

00:26:32.871 --> 00:26:36.838
had been built there earlier had
made an impression on them.

00:26:36.838 --> 00:26:42.663
They too decided to build their
tombs out of the living rock of

00:26:42.663 --> 00:26:45.262
Petra,
and they are among the most

00:26:45.262 --> 00:26:48.900
spectacular and unusual tombs
that survive from the Roman

00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:49.548
period.
 

00:26:49.548 --> 00:26:53.220
And I want to show two of them
to you today:

00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:57.060
the so-called Deir,
D-e-i-r, and the so-called

00:26:57.060 --> 00:26:59.108
Khazne, K-h-a-z-n-e.
 

00:26:59.108 --> 00:27:04.038
We will look at both of them,
with the Deir first.

00:27:04.038 --> 00:27:06.851
And if you look at the Deir,
and the way in which it has

00:27:06.851 --> 00:27:09.558
been created by carving it out
of the living rock,

00:27:09.558 --> 00:27:13.167
you should not only be
impressed, but you should say to

00:27:13.167 --> 00:27:16.521
yourself,
"Wow, this is Roman

00:27:16.521 --> 00:27:23.009
facadism at its greatest,"
at its most obvious as well.

00:27:23.009 --> 00:27:25.048
This is really Roman facadism,
because all there is is the

00:27:25.048 --> 00:27:26.410
façade,
there's nothing else.

00:27:26.410 --> 00:27:29.048
The tomb itself is located
inside the rock.

00:27:29.048 --> 00:27:31.720
The tomb chambers are inside
the rock.

00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:34.962
They didn't do anything to them
except hollow them out --

00:27:34.962 --> 00:27:36.470
nothing much else there.
 

00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:39.236
They've concentrated all of
their efforts on the

00:27:39.236 --> 00:27:41.827
façade,
which seems to grow out of the

00:27:41.827 --> 00:27:43.769
rock, almost as if by nature.
 

00:27:43.769 --> 00:27:48.009
And if you look at this tomb,
the Deir,

00:27:48.009 --> 00:27:52.569
you should also be struck
immediately by the way in which

00:27:52.569 --> 00:27:56.969
what the Romans have created
here is a version in built

00:27:56.969 --> 00:28:01.528
architecture of what we saw
already in 60 to 50 B.C.

00:28:01.528 --> 00:28:05.230
in Second Style Roman wall
painting.

00:28:05.230 --> 00:28:09.768
It is exactly the same kind of
thing: this idea of breaking a

00:28:09.768 --> 00:28:14.231
triangular pediment open to
reveal a tholos that lies

00:28:14.231 --> 00:28:18.890
inside,
in this case on a second story.

00:28:18.890 --> 00:28:21.528
We see all of the elements that
I've already mentioned,

00:28:21.528 --> 00:28:24.460
or most of the other elements
that I've already mentioned.

00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:26.818
We see here,
in this façade,

00:28:26.818 --> 00:28:30.132
the use of the traditional
vocabulary of architecture:

00:28:30.132 --> 00:28:33.797
the columns,
the entablature above,

00:28:33.797 --> 00:28:38.259
and pediments and so on down
here,

00:28:38.259 --> 00:28:42.009
triangular pediments down here.
 

00:28:42.009 --> 00:28:43.878
We see all of those,
but used in a way that the

00:28:43.878 --> 00:28:45.140
Greeks would never have done.
 

00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:47.769
And we see less in this one.
 

00:28:47.769 --> 00:28:50.612
I'll show you better examples
of this interest in over

00:28:50.612 --> 00:28:51.470
ornamentation.
 

00:28:51.470 --> 00:28:54.095
There is ornamentation here,
but it's actually fairly

00:28:54.095 --> 00:28:54.548
simple.
 

00:28:54.548 --> 00:28:57.806
So this one doesn't partake of
that, as much as others that I

00:28:57.806 --> 00:28:58.618
can show you.
 

00:28:58.618 --> 00:29:01.692
But it does definitely,
by using the traditional

00:29:01.692 --> 00:29:05.891
vocabulary of architecture;
the surface is enlivened by

00:29:05.891 --> 00:29:08.618
creating elements that project.
 

00:29:08.618 --> 00:29:10.509
Look at these columns on either
side,

00:29:10.509 --> 00:29:12.509
with their projecting
entablatures,

00:29:12.509 --> 00:29:15.941
standing alone--or more
pilasters than columns in this

00:29:15.941 --> 00:29:17.325
case--
standing alone,

00:29:17.325 --> 00:29:19.705
projecting--a receding bay,
a projecting bay,

00:29:19.705 --> 00:29:21.160
a receding bay,
a projecting bay--

00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:25.278
instilling motion across this
surface,

00:29:25.278 --> 00:29:29.380
by means of the traditional
vocabulary of architecture,

00:29:29.380 --> 00:29:32.970
again in this case on two
levels.

00:29:32.970 --> 00:29:38.160
Here's another view of the
façade of the Deir,

00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:40.058
on the left-hand side of the
screen,

00:29:40.058 --> 00:29:43.085
and you can see the material
used is obviously the rock

00:29:43.085 --> 00:29:43.588
itself.
 

00:29:43.588 --> 00:29:48.009
This has been literally carved
out of the living rock,

00:29:48.009 --> 00:29:51.410
so that it's obviously the same
stone and the same color as the

00:29:51.410 --> 00:29:53.660
rock that still serves as its
backdrop.

00:29:53.660 --> 00:29:56.292
And then over here,
the House of the Labyrinth

00:29:56.292 --> 00:29:59.015
again,
just to show you again the

00:29:59.015 --> 00:30:03.743
close resemblance of this sort
of thing in the mid-second

00:30:03.743 --> 00:30:08.128
century A.D.,
in what is now Jordan,

00:30:08.128 --> 00:30:13.088
to Second Style Roman wall
painting.

00:30:13.088 --> 00:30:15.338
And I show you again the
tholos within the broken

00:30:15.338 --> 00:30:16.240
triangular pediment.
 

00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:20.009
But the main difference between
the two--

00:30:20.009 --> 00:30:22.031
and here is where we do get
into this whole concept of

00:30:22.031 --> 00:30:23.519
decoration and even over
decoration--

00:30:23.519 --> 00:30:25.911
the main difference between the
two is when you're standing

00:30:25.911 --> 00:30:27.519
again in the House of the
Labyrinth,

00:30:27.519 --> 00:30:30.808
looking through the actual
columns,

00:30:30.808 --> 00:30:34.246
toward the painting,
and you see that the triangular

00:30:34.246 --> 00:30:38.019
pediment has been broken to
reveal the tholos,

00:30:38.019 --> 00:30:40.054
as I mentioned before,
you still have a sense of space

00:30:40.054 --> 00:30:41.588
and you still have a sense of
reality.

00:30:41.588 --> 00:30:42.970
Even though the pediment has
been broken,

00:30:42.970 --> 00:30:45.220
you seem to be--you are looking
at a tholos,

00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:48.855
and you're meant to think that
that tholos lies inside a

00:30:48.855 --> 00:30:50.856
peristyle court,
or a garden,

00:30:50.856 --> 00:30:54.772
that is outside the house,
that you're seeing through a

00:30:54.772 --> 00:30:55.298
window.
 

00:30:55.298 --> 00:30:57.821
So you read the tholos,
or at least I read the

00:30:57.821 --> 00:31:00.005
tholos,
as further back than the broken

00:31:00.005 --> 00:31:01.170
triangular pediment.
 

00:31:01.170 --> 00:31:03.279
That is entirely different here.
 

00:31:03.279 --> 00:31:05.680
Yes, there's a tholos;
yes, there's a broken

00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:06.769
triangular pediment.
 

00:31:06.769 --> 00:31:11.780
But the tholos has been
turned into a decorative motif,

00:31:11.780 --> 00:31:12.848
among many.
 

00:31:12.848 --> 00:31:15.357
It is a tholos,
yes, but it doesn't look like a

00:31:15.357 --> 00:31:17.108
working tholos,
so to speak.

00:31:17.108 --> 00:31:20.718
You can see that it has a niche
in the center of it,

00:31:20.718 --> 00:31:24.681
just like the other bays have
niches that probably held a

00:31:24.681 --> 00:31:25.460
statue.
 

00:31:25.460 --> 00:31:30.038
But you don't have a sense that
there is any space in there.

00:31:30.038 --> 00:31:33.757
It is a decoration on the
surface, on the façade,

00:31:33.757 --> 00:31:36.528
of this structure,
just like all the other

00:31:36.528 --> 00:31:37.608
decorations.
 

00:31:37.608 --> 00:31:41.040
And that is a major difference
between the way in which the

00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:44.413
tholos is used in the
Deir and the tholos is

00:31:44.413 --> 00:31:47.548
used in typical Second Style
Roman wall painting.

00:31:47.548 --> 00:31:50.410
You may also have noticed some
of the decoration;

00:31:50.410 --> 00:31:54.030
and I'm going to show you some
details now, so that we can look

00:31:54.030 --> 00:31:55.200
at those together.
 

00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:59.907
Here you get a very good sense
of the color of the stone,

00:31:59.907 --> 00:32:02.009
of the rocks,
of Petra.

00:32:02.009 --> 00:32:04.348
But you also see here a capital
that is unlike any capital that

00:32:04.348 --> 00:32:05.180
we have seen before.
 

00:32:05.180 --> 00:32:08.848
And this is where we see the
influence of the Nabataeans.

00:32:08.848 --> 00:32:12.009
The Nabataeans were building
buildings that had capitals that

00:32:12.009 --> 00:32:14.526
looked this,
sort of interesting undulating

00:32:14.526 --> 00:32:16.396
capitals,
but very plain:

00:32:16.396 --> 00:32:20.932
plain with a concave side and
then a kind of knob in the

00:32:20.932 --> 00:32:23.358
center,
as you can see here.

00:32:23.358 --> 00:32:27.163
These are Nabataean capitals,
and in this mid-second century

00:32:27.163 --> 00:32:27.421
A.D.
 

00:32:27.421 --> 00:32:31.417
tomb you can see that they are
looking, they're clearly looking

00:32:31.417 --> 00:32:33.029
at models from Rome.
 

00:32:33.029 --> 00:32:37.632
They are clearly looking at the
kinds of paintings that I have

00:32:37.632 --> 00:32:41.647
already reminded you of,
but at the same time--or let's

00:32:41.647 --> 00:32:45.670
say drawings made from those
paintings that are circulated,

00:32:45.670 --> 00:32:48.038
or the architects may have
access to.

00:32:48.038 --> 00:32:50.338
But they are combined with
local elements,

00:32:50.338 --> 00:32:52.470
in this case the Nabataean
capitals.

00:32:52.470 --> 00:32:54.798
And then if you look at this
detail over here,

00:32:54.798 --> 00:33:00.108
you will see that they've used
a kind of triglyph and metope

00:33:00.108 --> 00:33:02.260
system,
with the panels and then the

00:33:02.260 --> 00:33:04.942
triple striated bands that we
saw was characteristic of Greek

00:33:04.942 --> 00:33:06.730
Doric architecture;
that's used here.

00:33:06.730 --> 00:33:08.368
But look at what's in the
metope.

00:33:08.368 --> 00:33:12.490
We don't see anything like this
in Greek or Roman architecture;

00:33:12.490 --> 00:33:14.632
the metopes,
in fact, in Greek architecture

00:33:14.632 --> 00:33:17.538
are usually filled with figural
scenes, figural panels.

00:33:17.538 --> 00:33:22.653
But here we see these large
disks, and a disk in each one of

00:33:22.653 --> 00:33:24.559
these square panels.
 

00:33:24.559 --> 00:33:27.140
These are Nabataean disks.
 

00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:30.009
They are used in earlier
Nabataean architecture.

00:33:30.009 --> 00:33:34.064
So once again this very
interesting and very fruitful

00:33:34.064 --> 00:33:38.586
coming together of Nabataean
elements and of Roman elements

00:33:38.586 --> 00:33:43.029
in this extraordinary tomb of
the mid-second century.

00:33:43.029 --> 00:33:45.067
And then I show you,
on the left-hand side of the

00:33:45.067 --> 00:33:47.150
screen, the finial that caps the
tholos.

00:33:47.150 --> 00:33:50.625
And a fellow sitting over here,
at the base of the finial,

00:33:50.625 --> 00:33:54.099
is very helpful to us because
he gives us a sense of human

00:33:54.099 --> 00:33:54.710
scale.
 

00:33:54.710 --> 00:33:59.099
This is this man;
he's small compared to the

00:33:59.099 --> 00:34:00.019
finial.
 

00:34:00.019 --> 00:34:01.791
So you can imagine how small he
is in relationship to the tomb

00:34:01.791 --> 00:34:02.170
as a whole.
 

00:34:02.170 --> 00:34:06.740
So once again bigger is better
reigns supreme in Jordan,

00:34:06.740 --> 00:34:10.193
as it did in Rome,
where we can see that the

00:34:10.193 --> 00:34:14.610
Romans are building very large
in the second century.

00:34:14.610 --> 00:34:18.320
If we look at this finial here,
this decoration at the apex,

00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:21.804
we see that they have used one
of these Nabataean capitals

00:34:21.804 --> 00:34:25.264
again here,
and that that supports a kind

00:34:25.264 --> 00:34:29.039
of fat vase on the top,
with a top on it.

00:34:29.039 --> 00:34:33.750
And that, you see that sort of
thing in Roman art;

00:34:33.750 --> 00:34:38.039
you see it sometimes in Second
Style Roman wall paintings.

00:34:38.039 --> 00:34:41.425
It's probably a Greco-Roman
motif that has been combined

00:34:41.425 --> 00:34:43.518
with the Nabataean capital here.
 

00:34:43.518 --> 00:34:45.900
And you can also see,
from looking at this,

00:34:45.900 --> 00:34:49.461
as well as the tomb as a whole,
that the architect is really

00:34:49.461 --> 00:34:52.842
treating these buildings almost
more as sculpture than as

00:34:52.842 --> 00:34:55.260
architecture,
molding them in a way that a

00:34:55.260 --> 00:34:56.018
sculptor might.
 

00:34:56.018 --> 00:34:58.960
And that's not so different
from what we saw Rabirius,

00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:03.012
for example,
doing in his octagonal room and

00:35:03.012 --> 00:35:08.010
in the fountain at the Palace on
the Palatine Hill.

00:35:08.010 --> 00:35:11.646
Here again Borromini,
Francesco Borromini's Sant'Ivo,

00:35:11.646 --> 00:35:15.351
the uppermost part of that,
just to show you again the

00:35:15.351 --> 00:35:18.010
kind--these are by no means
exact;

00:35:18.010 --> 00:35:19.528
there's no exact relationship
between these two at all,

00:35:19.528 --> 00:35:20.880
and this one has different
features than that.

00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:25.210
But just to show you that it's
this kind of thing that

00:35:25.210 --> 00:35:29.702
unquestionably inspires
architects like Borromini in the

00:35:29.702 --> 00:35:34.768
seventeenth century in Italy to
create the kind of lanterns and

00:35:34.768 --> 00:35:39.590
so on that they do for the
churches that they design.

00:35:39.590 --> 00:35:41.260
Here's another interesting
comparison.

00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:44.760
This is a wonderful view of the
Deir in Petra,

00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:49.150
which shows you I guess best of
all the way in which it is

00:35:49.150 --> 00:35:53.927
carved out of and still embedded
into the rock of Petra itself;

00:35:53.927 --> 00:35:55.159
magnificent.
 

00:35:55.159 --> 00:35:59.139
And I compare it here too to
another Borromini church.

00:35:59.139 --> 00:36:03.788
This is the famous Church of
San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane,

00:36:03.788 --> 00:36:07.648
better known as San Carlino,
the Little San Carlo,

00:36:07.648 --> 00:36:10.250
San Carlino,
as you see here.

00:36:10.250 --> 00:36:12.429
And you see what Borromini has
done.

00:36:12.429 --> 00:36:14.768
He has the undulating
façade--

00:36:14.768 --> 00:36:17.280
he's using the traditional
vocabulary of architecture,

00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:21.193
just like these architects are,
these nameless architects are:

00:36:21.193 --> 00:36:24.659
the columns and the
entablatures and the pediments,

00:36:24.659 --> 00:36:25.860
and so on and so forth.
 

00:36:25.860 --> 00:36:27.599
He's using all of those here.
 

00:36:27.599 --> 00:36:33.626
He even has a tholos in
the second--in the upper story,

00:36:33.626 --> 00:36:35.010
right there.
 

00:36:35.010 --> 00:36:38.847
And he is also very taken with
the whole idea of an actual

00:36:38.847 --> 00:36:41.742
undulating wall,
as you can see also in this

00:36:41.742 --> 00:36:42.349
view.
 

00:36:42.349 --> 00:36:46.152
But he is doing the same sort
of thing that we see architects

00:36:46.152 --> 00:36:48.673
doing here,
and I don't think there's any

00:36:48.673 --> 00:36:51.606
question that the sort of
building that we see on the

00:36:51.606 --> 00:36:53.708
right,
the Deir, had impact on

00:36:53.708 --> 00:36:56.320
architects in the seventeenth
century.

00:36:56.320 --> 00:36:59.248
We know that some of them
traveled to this part of the

00:36:59.248 --> 00:36:59.690
world.
 

00:36:59.690 --> 00:37:04.030
We know that drawings were
made, that books were made,

00:37:04.030 --> 00:37:06.000
that these were brought back,
these were seen by people in

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:07.210
Rome in the seventeenth
century--

00:37:07.210 --> 00:37:09.480
and of course they had local
things to see as well in Italy--

00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:13.230
and that they were influenced
by what they saw.

00:37:13.230 --> 00:37:15.382
The other rock-cut tomb,
the other very

00:37:15.382 --> 00:37:17.989
impressive--there are many of
them in Petra;

00:37:17.989 --> 00:37:21.619
I'm only showing you two out of
a fairly nice variety.

00:37:21.619 --> 00:37:26.543
But I want to show you the
other most famous one,

00:37:26.543 --> 00:37:28.800
the Khazne in Petra.
 

00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:31.989
It also dates to the mid-second
century A.D.

00:37:31.989 --> 00:37:34.969
Once again carved out of the
living rock.

00:37:34.969 --> 00:37:38.913
Once again pure facadism;
this is nothing more than a

00:37:38.913 --> 00:37:39.659
façade.
 

00:37:39.659 --> 00:37:45.550
You can see how in this
case--once again two-storied--

00:37:45.550 --> 00:37:49.420
a very similar scheme to what
we saw at the Deir--

00:37:49.420 --> 00:37:52.034
two-storied,
with a temple front down below

00:37:52.034 --> 00:37:55.360
and a tholos above,
that is revealed by the

00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:57.940
splitting of the triangular
pediment,

00:37:57.940 --> 00:37:59.599
as you can see well.
 

00:37:59.599 --> 00:38:02.565
Once again the tholos
definitely treated as a

00:38:02.565 --> 00:38:03.670
decorative motif.
 

00:38:03.670 --> 00:38:06.090
Yes, in this case it has a
statue on a base,

00:38:06.090 --> 00:38:09.670
but a statue on a base that is
not a real statue on a base,

00:38:09.670 --> 00:38:17.050
but a statue on a base that is
carved onto the stone.

00:38:17.050 --> 00:38:19.273
So once again we get a sense
that this is a decorative motif

00:38:19.273 --> 00:38:21.610
rather than an actual statue
standing in the tholos,

00:38:21.610 --> 00:38:25.369
and the same for the items on
the bases on either side.

00:38:25.369 --> 00:38:27.699
You can see the triangular
pediment very well.

00:38:27.699 --> 00:38:30.981
You can see the way it has been
split aside to reveal the

00:38:30.981 --> 00:38:31.920
tholos.
 

00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:34.512
You can see down below a real
temple front,

00:38:34.512 --> 00:38:35.440
in this case.
 

00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:38.860
This one is much closer to its
Roman prototypes,

00:38:38.860 --> 00:38:43.010
in the sense that even the
decorative motifs are Roman.

00:38:43.010 --> 00:38:45.882
Unlike in the Deir,
where we saw the Nabataean

00:38:45.882 --> 00:38:49.264
capitals and the disks,
here we see actual versions of

00:38:49.264 --> 00:38:52.739
the Corinthian order used;
the Corinthian order used here.

00:38:52.739 --> 00:38:55.027
This looks very much like a
real temple front,

00:38:55.027 --> 00:38:57.773
with an actual pediment;
sculptural decoration,

00:38:57.773 --> 00:38:58.940
a frieze as well.
 

00:38:58.940 --> 00:39:00.829
We're beginning to see,
in this one,

00:39:00.829 --> 00:39:03.626
not only the use of the
traditional vocabulary of

00:39:03.626 --> 00:39:06.293
architecture,
and not only the enlivening of

00:39:06.293 --> 00:39:09.007
the surface using that
traditional vocabulary of

00:39:09.007 --> 00:39:13.257
architecture through these--
in such a way that it creates

00:39:13.257 --> 00:39:15.463
motion--
projection, recession,

00:39:15.463 --> 00:39:19.554
projection, recession--
but we also are seeing here,

00:39:19.554 --> 00:39:23.059
in a way that we did not in the
Deir,

00:39:23.059 --> 00:39:25.085
this interest in excess
ornamentation:

00:39:25.085 --> 00:39:27.880
ornamenting every surface that
you possibly can,

00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:31.260
with sculptural friezes,
with pedimental sculpture,

00:39:31.260 --> 00:39:36.630
with statuary carved into the
stone in all of the niches.

00:39:36.630 --> 00:39:39.561
But then again,
a much closer relationship to

00:39:39.561 --> 00:39:42.492
earlier Roman precedence by the
temple front,

00:39:42.492 --> 00:39:45.090
by the use of the Corinthian
order.

00:39:45.090 --> 00:39:48.423
But this one too,
a very similar finial at the

00:39:48.423 --> 00:39:52.498
top of the tholos,
but using a kind of Corinthian

00:39:52.498 --> 00:39:55.760
capital, with one of those vases
on top;

00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:59.019
vases, by the way,
that we often see in Second

00:39:59.019 --> 00:40:01.050
Style Roman wall painting.
 

00:40:01.050 --> 00:40:05.655
Once again, one could come up
with a lot of comparisons for

00:40:05.655 --> 00:40:09.626
the Khazne with monuments,
with seventeenth-century

00:40:09.626 --> 00:40:12.010
Baroque buildings in Rome.
 

00:40:12.010 --> 00:40:14.786
This may not be the best,
but it's one of my favorites

00:40:14.786 --> 00:40:17.039
and I decided to show it in this
context.

00:40:17.039 --> 00:40:19.039
But it's the Church of Santa
Maria--it's right near the

00:40:19.039 --> 00:40:21.224
Piazza Navona--Santa Maria della
Pace, designed by Pietro da

00:40:21.224 --> 00:40:21.670
Cortona.
 

00:40:21.670 --> 00:40:26.422
Same sort of idea;
you know, the temple front down

00:40:26.422 --> 00:40:27.030
below.
 

00:40:27.030 --> 00:40:28.572
Yes, this is a different kind
of temple front,

00:40:28.572 --> 00:40:30.559
because it's a round temple and
not one with a pediment.

00:40:30.559 --> 00:40:33.619
But the same general idea of
having a temple front below,

00:40:33.619 --> 00:40:36.780
and then a second story above,
all of this enlivened with

00:40:36.780 --> 00:40:39.150
traditional vocabulary of
architecture--

00:40:39.150 --> 00:40:42.201
columns, columns,
pilasters, a window in the

00:40:42.201 --> 00:40:44.675
niche,
right up there a very

00:40:44.675 --> 00:40:50.010
interesting segmental pediment
inside a triangular pediment.

00:40:50.010 --> 00:40:52.568
Just to show you that this kind
of experimentation that we see

00:40:52.568 --> 00:40:54.539
in seventeenth-century Baroque
architecture,

00:40:54.539 --> 00:40:57.090
mostly in church building but
also in palaces,

00:40:57.090 --> 00:41:02.943
is so clearly inspired,
let's say, by the baroque

00:41:02.943 --> 00:41:07.090
architecture of Roman antiquity.
 

00:41:07.090 --> 00:41:10.018
A couple more details here.
 

00:41:10.018 --> 00:41:13.271
Here's a wonderful view from
down below showing you the

00:41:13.271 --> 00:41:15.679
tholos of the Khazne at
Petra,

00:41:15.679 --> 00:41:19.090
and comparing it to,
once again, some of the

00:41:19.090 --> 00:41:22.659
confections of baroque
architects in Rome,

00:41:22.659 --> 00:41:26.190
of the seventeenth century,
namely Sant'Ivo again,

00:41:26.190 --> 00:41:33.110
with its curved façade
and wonderful eight-sided dome,

00:41:33.110 --> 00:41:39.074
and some of the interior
decoration also of Sant'Ivo

00:41:39.074 --> 00:41:40.010
above.
 

00:41:40.010 --> 00:41:42.380
Staying on the--staying in the
Eastern Empire,

00:41:42.380 --> 00:41:47.530
I want to go now to ancient
Asia Minor,

00:41:47.530 --> 00:41:52.297
to two sites on the coast,
on the western coast of what is

00:41:52.297 --> 00:41:55.626
now Turkey,
Ephesus and Miletus,

00:41:55.626 --> 00:41:57.889
Ephesus and Miletus.
 

00:41:57.889 --> 00:42:02.222
And I want to begin in Ephesus,
to show you one building there

00:42:02.222 --> 00:42:05.632
of considerable interest I
think, in terms of its

00:42:05.632 --> 00:42:07.480
relationships to Rome.
 

00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:13.244
It is the Temple of Hadrian,
so called, that dates to around

00:42:13.244 --> 00:42:14.710
120 to 130 A.D.
 

00:42:14.710 --> 00:42:16.079
in Ephesus.
 

00:42:16.079 --> 00:42:20.010
We know Hadrian visited Ephesus.
 

00:42:20.010 --> 00:42:22.411
We know that those who lived
there wanted to honor him by

00:42:22.411 --> 00:42:23.570
building a temple to him.
 

00:42:23.570 --> 00:42:25.780
It is actually more a shrine
than a temple.

00:42:25.780 --> 00:42:30.246
This is not a bigger is better;
this is actually a fairly small

00:42:30.246 --> 00:42:32.121
structure, as I said,
more a shrine than it is a

00:42:32.121 --> 00:42:32.518
temple.
 

00:42:32.518 --> 00:42:34.860
It's a kind of street side
temple.

00:42:34.860 --> 00:42:37.282
You're walking along the street
and then there,

00:42:37.282 --> 00:42:38.599
all of a sudden,
it is.

00:42:38.599 --> 00:42:43.112
But what's interesting about it
is the fact that it makes use of

00:42:43.112 --> 00:42:45.969
the arcuated lintel,
as you can see here,

00:42:45.969 --> 00:42:50.204
straight and curved,
just as we saw it used at the

00:42:50.204 --> 00:42:53.010
Canopus at Hadrian's Villa.
 

00:42:53.010 --> 00:42:56.463
So a motif that we see in
Italy, being used also in Asia

00:42:56.463 --> 00:42:59.039
Minor for another Hadrianic
building --

00:42:59.039 --> 00:43:03.036
so it's becoming associated,
in the minds of designers,

00:43:03.036 --> 00:43:04.739
with Hadrian himself.
 

00:43:04.739 --> 00:43:07.559
So traditional vocabulary of
architecture,

00:43:07.559 --> 00:43:11.204
but used in a different way,
by using the straight and

00:43:11.204 --> 00:43:13.199
arcuated lintel together.
 

00:43:13.199 --> 00:43:17.215
This is a very good example of
this interest in

00:43:17.215 --> 00:43:19.050
over-ornamentation.
 

00:43:19.050 --> 00:43:23.931
Every single square inch is
used by the architects to

00:43:23.931 --> 00:43:29.155
decorate: as you can see,
the architrave and also the

00:43:29.155 --> 00:43:34.059
lintel in the back and the
pilasters in the back,

00:43:34.059 --> 00:43:37.824
all of them decorated to the
point where the decoration

00:43:37.824 --> 00:43:41.309
almost dematerializes the
architectural members.

00:43:41.309 --> 00:43:45.465
Another detail where I think
you can see that particularly

00:43:45.465 --> 00:43:46.961
well,
here on the right,

00:43:46.961 --> 00:43:49.900
this dematerialization of the
architectural members through

00:43:49.900 --> 00:43:50.559
sculpture.
 

00:43:50.559 --> 00:43:57.083
And you'll remember this same
approach in the Severan Basilica

00:43:57.083 --> 00:43:59.010
in Leptis Magna.
 

00:43:59.010 --> 00:44:02.360
This is a detail of the piers
that we believe were added

00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:05.530
during the time of Caracalla --
so around 216 A.D.

00:44:05.530 --> 00:44:09.539
Obviously much later in date,
but we see already here this

00:44:09.539 --> 00:44:13.690
interest in this sort of thing,
that's going to culminate at

00:44:13.690 --> 00:44:15.309
places like Leptis.
 

00:44:15.309 --> 00:44:18.541
And also just to make the point
that this same use of the

00:44:18.541 --> 00:44:21.699
straight and arcuated lintel,
that we see in Hadrianic

00:44:21.699 --> 00:44:24.286
architecture,
turns up also in

00:44:24.286 --> 00:44:28.039
seventeenth-century Baroque
Rome.

00:44:28.039 --> 00:44:30.123
I show you the interior of San
Carlino here,

00:44:30.123 --> 00:44:32.838
where you can see again the
straight and arcuated lintels

00:44:32.838 --> 00:44:33.469
combined.
 

00:44:33.469 --> 00:44:37.422
So clearly seventeenth-century
Baroque architects looking back

00:44:37.422 --> 00:44:38.719
at Roman examples.
 

00:44:38.719 --> 00:44:42.264
I want to show you briefly a
gate at Miletus,

00:44:42.264 --> 00:44:45.650
also, as you saw,
in ancient Asia Minor.

00:44:45.650 --> 00:44:51.538
It's the gate to the South
Agora or marketplace of Miletus,

00:44:51.538 --> 00:44:54.279
and it dates to around A.D.
 

00:44:54.279 --> 00:44:54.989
160.
 

00:44:54.989 --> 00:44:59.030
It is no longer in Miletus.
 

00:44:59.030 --> 00:45:02.137
It was moved some years ago,
as antiquities sometimes are,

00:45:02.137 --> 00:45:04.320
from its country of origin to
Germany.

00:45:04.320 --> 00:45:09.010
It now can be seen in the
museum in Berlin.

00:45:09.010 --> 00:45:11.382
They also have a great model in
Berlin that shows you the

00:45:11.382 --> 00:45:13.800
relationship of the gate to the
rest of the Roman city;

00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:16.650
and you can see the gate way up
there.

00:45:16.650 --> 00:45:21.244
An incredible showpiece for the
city, this gate that allowed one

00:45:21.244 --> 00:45:23.579
to enter into the South Agora.
 

00:45:23.579 --> 00:45:27.221
I show it to you as
reconstructed in the museum in

00:45:27.221 --> 00:45:27.889
Berlin.
 

00:45:27.889 --> 00:45:32.010
It is quite an impressive piece.
 

00:45:32.010 --> 00:45:33.925
You can see here,
it is that, it is a gate,

00:45:33.925 --> 00:45:36.525
and it shows that you could
apply these baroque facades to

00:45:36.525 --> 00:45:38.349
just about any kind of
architecture.

00:45:38.349 --> 00:45:42.447
You see that the gate has a
triple opening down below,

00:45:42.447 --> 00:45:44.690
three blind windows on top.
 

00:45:44.690 --> 00:45:46.619
It is made entirely out of
stone.

00:45:46.619 --> 00:45:50.858
It uses the traditional
vocabulary of architecture:

00:45:50.858 --> 00:45:52.809
columns and capitals.
 

00:45:52.809 --> 00:45:56.527
You can see the capitals in
this case are--seem to be

00:45:56.527 --> 00:45:58.030
composite capitals.
 

00:45:58.030 --> 00:46:01.554
And it is very much the
theater, the theater scaenae

00:46:01.554 --> 00:46:05.001
frons idea,
with a series of projecting

00:46:05.001 --> 00:46:09.672
elements on top of two columns,
with wings on either side,

00:46:09.672 --> 00:46:10.909
also projecting.
 

00:46:10.909 --> 00:46:13.469
Down below, the lintels are
straight,

00:46:13.469 --> 00:46:17.713
but up above they have combined
full triangular pediments in the

00:46:17.713 --> 00:46:20.119
wings,
with a broken triangular

00:46:20.119 --> 00:46:21.920
pediment in the center.
 

00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:24.677
And the broken triangular
pediment in the center is

00:46:24.677 --> 00:46:27.543
particularly interesting,
because you can see the two

00:46:27.543 --> 00:46:29.530
sides, left and right,
up above.

00:46:29.530 --> 00:46:32.860
But you can also see that
they've included the center of

00:46:32.860 --> 00:46:35.463
the pediment,
but in a plane that is further

00:46:35.463 --> 00:46:36.010
back.
 

00:46:36.010 --> 00:46:38.940
So you get this kind of zigzag
motif,

00:46:38.940 --> 00:46:43.443
where you begin--the pediment
begins in the front zone and

00:46:43.443 --> 00:46:48.125
then zigzags to the back zone,
which injects even further,

00:46:48.125 --> 00:46:52.900
even a greater motion,
into the overall scheme.

00:46:52.900 --> 00:46:56.369
Once again we see the
projection, the recession,

00:46:56.369 --> 00:46:59.840
projection, recession,
all using the traditional

00:46:59.840 --> 00:47:02.130
vocabulary of architecture.
 

00:47:02.130 --> 00:47:06.016
It's interesting to compare
this to a much earlier gate in

00:47:06.016 --> 00:47:06.630
Greece.
 

00:47:06.630 --> 00:47:09.800
I show you the Propylaia,
the gateway to the Athenian

00:47:09.800 --> 00:47:13.217
Acropolis, fifth century B.C.,
where you can see it's all

00:47:13.217 --> 00:47:14.010
function.
 

00:47:14.010 --> 00:47:17.652
They've used the Doric order
here, and the columns support

00:47:17.652 --> 00:47:20.610
the roof above;
triglyphs and metopes.

00:47:20.610 --> 00:47:23.777
The whole idea--it's very
beautiful--but the whole idea is

00:47:23.777 --> 00:47:25.780
to use these columns
functionally.

00:47:25.780 --> 00:47:29.429
Very different in this gate in
Miletus,

00:47:29.429 --> 00:47:32.951
in the second century A.D.,
where you can see that the

00:47:32.951 --> 00:47:36.539
columns are no longer used for
structural purposes,

00:47:36.539 --> 00:47:40.757
but mainly to decorate and to
enliven and to add motion to the

00:47:40.757 --> 00:47:44.490
structure in a way that is
entirely out of keeping with

00:47:44.490 --> 00:47:47.050
these important Greek
precedents.

00:47:47.050 --> 00:47:52.802
Here you see a detail:
some tourists looking at this

00:47:52.802 --> 00:47:55.860
and other things,
in the museum in Berlin,

00:47:55.860 --> 00:47:57.795
which gives you again a sense
of the colossal scale of this

00:47:57.795 --> 00:47:58.230
structure.
 

00:47:58.230 --> 00:48:04.010
Here you can see also very well
the composite capitals,

00:48:04.010 --> 00:48:07.193
as well as once again this
interest in an almost overly

00:48:07.193 --> 00:48:10.376
decorative surface that is so
characteristic of baroque

00:48:10.376 --> 00:48:11.380
architecture.
 

00:48:11.380 --> 00:48:15.844
A number of you embarked on the
Library of Celsus as your paper

00:48:15.844 --> 00:48:18.378
topic;
so I'm sure you know everything

00:48:18.378 --> 00:48:20.210
there is to know about that.
 

00:48:20.210 --> 00:48:23.364
But I want to show it to you
quickly, in the context of this

00:48:23.364 --> 00:48:26.199
lecture, because it's an
important monument for all of

00:48:26.199 --> 00:48:27.429
you to be aware of.
 

00:48:27.429 --> 00:48:31.501
Lest you think that it has
always looked the way it looks

00:48:31.501 --> 00:48:33.788
now,
I show you a view that was

00:48:33.788 --> 00:48:37.139
taken, well by now twenty-five
years ago or so,

00:48:37.139 --> 00:48:39.559
before the building was
re-erected,

00:48:39.559 --> 00:48:42.480
which it has been since then.
 

00:48:42.480 --> 00:48:46.570
The building--this is what the
Library of Celsus looked like

00:48:46.570 --> 00:48:48.650
twenty-five or so years ago.
 

00:48:48.650 --> 00:48:52.103
But fortunately,
even though everything had

00:48:52.103 --> 00:48:56.050
fallen down, it was all there,
as you can see.

00:48:56.050 --> 00:48:58.393
There were fragments strewn
everywhere: hundreds and

00:48:58.393 --> 00:49:00.599
hundreds of fragments strewn
around the site,

00:49:00.599 --> 00:49:04.239
and enough fragments so that
basically the building was

00:49:04.239 --> 00:49:04.780
there.
 

00:49:04.780 --> 00:49:07.396
And what they eventually
decided to do was use those

00:49:07.396 --> 00:49:10.320
fragments to re-erect it,
which took a number of years.

00:49:10.320 --> 00:49:12.829
And the results have been truly
spectacular.

00:49:12.829 --> 00:49:17.018
I show you a view of Ephesus as
it looks today,

00:49:17.018 --> 00:49:23.000
looking back toward the
re-erected Library of Celsus,

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:24.615
and then a better view here,
where you can see what all of

00:49:24.615 --> 00:49:26.840
those pieces,
the giant jigsaw puzzle that

00:49:26.840 --> 00:49:29.179
all of those pieces ultimately
made.

00:49:29.179 --> 00:49:33.282
You can see here this
incredible façade of the

00:49:33.282 --> 00:49:35.730
Library of Celsus in Ephesus.
 

00:49:35.730 --> 00:49:39.800
And you can see the scheme is
the same as I've just showed you

00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:43.672
in the South Agora Market Gate
at Miletus, in this case two

00:49:43.672 --> 00:49:44.340
tiers.
 

00:49:44.340 --> 00:49:48.884
The bottom tier is very similar
to what we saw there,

00:49:48.884 --> 00:49:54.039
just two columns supporting a
straight entablature above.

00:49:54.039 --> 00:49:57.347
And then in the second story,
the addition of more decorative

00:49:57.347 --> 00:49:58.777
elements,
with segmental,

00:49:58.777 --> 00:50:01.440
two segmental pediments
flanking a rectangular one in

00:50:01.440 --> 00:50:04.215
the center,
with separate individual

00:50:04.215 --> 00:50:07.757
columns at either end,
like we saw in the Deir,

00:50:07.757 --> 00:50:10.320
with supporting projecting
entablature.

00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:13.054
Once again using the
traditional vocabulary of

00:50:13.054 --> 00:50:15.972
architecture to create motion
across the surface:

00:50:15.972 --> 00:50:18.949
projection, recession,
projection, recession.

00:50:18.949 --> 00:50:23.106
But here, one very interesting
feature is that if you look at

00:50:23.106 --> 00:50:26.916
the second story and the
placement of those second story

00:50:26.916 --> 00:50:31.132
elements on top of those below,
you can see that the ones at

00:50:31.132 --> 00:50:34.579
the top are not directly above
the ones at the bottom,

00:50:34.579 --> 00:50:38.197
as we saw in the market gate,
but they straddle the space

00:50:38.197 --> 00:50:40.179
below,
which is very interesting.

00:50:40.179 --> 00:50:42.179
So instead of having the two
columns,

00:50:42.179 --> 00:50:46.150
with a pediment above,
right above this,

00:50:46.150 --> 00:50:48.800
you can see the columns with
the pediment above are right

00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:52.206
above the space,
so they're straddling the

00:50:52.206 --> 00:50:53.010
spaces.
 

00:50:53.010 --> 00:50:55.387
Which, if you look at it for
awhile, you'll see adds an

00:50:55.387 --> 00:50:58.119
additional sense of motion to
the surface of this structure.

00:50:58.119 --> 00:51:01.711
I think you can also see from
this general view the interest

00:51:01.711 --> 00:51:02.869
in ornamentation.
 

00:51:02.869 --> 00:51:05.780
You can see that perhaps much
better here, in these details.

00:51:05.780 --> 00:51:08.119
Here's a detail of one of the
niches.

00:51:08.119 --> 00:51:11.920
Some of the statues are still
preserved, with the names of the

00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:13.789
figures in Greek down below.
 

00:51:13.789 --> 00:51:16.849
You can see the way in which
they have essentially

00:51:16.849 --> 00:51:20.659
dematerialized the piers by
decorating them so extensively.

00:51:20.659 --> 00:51:23.728
And this wonderful view up,
where you can see the

00:51:23.728 --> 00:51:26.159
variegated marble that is used
here.

00:51:26.159 --> 00:51:27.889
You can see the coffered
ceiling.

00:51:27.889 --> 00:51:32.282
You can see the deep
undercutting of the capitals,

00:51:32.282 --> 00:51:36.585
and the entablature,
and how overly ornamental it

00:51:36.585 --> 00:51:38.018
actually is.
 

00:51:38.018 --> 00:51:40.626
And you can also see that in
the uppermost part actually what

00:51:40.626 --> 00:51:43.108
they've created here,
in this particular building,

00:51:43.108 --> 00:51:44.960
is something that looks very
much,

00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:49.052
I think, like the architectural
cages at the upper tier of the

00:51:49.052 --> 00:51:50.059
Fourth Style.
 

00:51:50.059 --> 00:51:54.010
And I remind you of a detail of
one of those,

00:51:54.010 --> 00:51:56.885
from that fragment from
Herculaneum that shows the same

00:51:56.885 --> 00:51:59.070
sort of coffered ceiling and
elements,

00:51:59.070 --> 00:52:02.199
as well as the split triangular
pediment,

00:52:02.199 --> 00:52:07.219
that we see also in built
architecture in the second

00:52:07.219 --> 00:52:08.400
century A.D.
 

00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:09.780
in Ephesus.
 

00:52:09.780 --> 00:52:12.590
The inside of the structure
looked like this.

00:52:12.590 --> 00:52:15.840
This is from Ward-Perkins,
showing you one main niche;

00:52:15.840 --> 00:52:19.336
a couple of other tiers with
columns, much simpler inside,

00:52:19.336 --> 00:52:20.380
as you can see.
 

00:52:20.380 --> 00:52:24.052
The niches had shelves,
and this is where the scrolls

00:52:24.052 --> 00:52:26.030
were kept, in the library.
 

00:52:26.030 --> 00:52:31.760
And here a niche,
beneath which was a place for

00:52:31.760 --> 00:52:36.119
the last resting place of
Celsus.

00:52:36.119 --> 00:52:38.469
I mentioned this to you when we
talked about the paper topics,

00:52:38.469 --> 00:52:42.936
that Celsus wanted--he built
this library as a benefaction to

00:52:42.936 --> 00:52:45.985
his city,
to benefit the citizenry

00:52:45.985 --> 00:52:49.121
obviously of the city,
as well as to have a building

00:52:49.121 --> 00:52:49.800
to put his name on.
 

00:52:49.800 --> 00:52:52.161
But he liked it so much,
and it meant so much to him,

00:52:52.161 --> 00:52:54.070
that he decided to make it his
own tomb.

00:52:54.070 --> 00:52:57.719
He was buried in his library,
beneath that central niche;

00:52:57.719 --> 00:53:01.061
you see it in plan here,
the location of that central

00:53:01.061 --> 00:53:05.199
niche--
so as he could be in the midst

00:53:05.199 --> 00:53:10.422
of this extraordinary building
that he built,

00:53:10.422 --> 00:53:12.440
in perpetuity.
 

00:53:12.440 --> 00:53:16.351
Another showpiece done in this
same ancient Roman baroque style

00:53:16.351 --> 00:53:19.380
is the one that you see here,
in a restored view,

00:53:19.380 --> 00:53:21.590
from the Ward-Perkins textbook.
 

00:53:21.590 --> 00:53:24.829
It dates to the early second
century A.D.

00:53:24.829 --> 00:53:27.914
It's a nymphaeum,
or a fountain,

00:53:27.914 --> 00:53:30.429
located at Miletus in Turkey.
 

00:53:30.429 --> 00:53:32.489
We see it here.
 

00:53:32.489 --> 00:53:36.510
And it was also an
extraordinary structure.

00:53:36.510 --> 00:53:40.239
It was much more ostentatious
than it needed to be;

00:53:40.239 --> 00:53:42.550
it could get the job done with
a lot less.

00:53:42.550 --> 00:53:44.769
Its purpose was to serve as a
fountain.

00:53:44.769 --> 00:53:46.199
You've got the basin down below.
 

00:53:46.199 --> 00:53:49.409
You could do this with a single
story certainly.

00:53:49.409 --> 00:53:52.659
But they built up three stories
in this particular place.

00:53:52.659 --> 00:53:55.420
They've been as ostentatious as
they possibly can.

00:53:55.420 --> 00:53:57.579
They've spent as much money as
they possibly can.

00:53:57.579 --> 00:54:02.793
Because I think it was a form
of one-upsmanship from one city

00:54:02.793 --> 00:54:05.025
to the next;
you know, I have a better

00:54:05.025 --> 00:54:07.057
fountain than you've got,
or I've got a more ornate

00:54:07.057 --> 00:54:09.010
fountain than you've got,
was the whole idea;

00:54:09.010 --> 00:54:12.603
our city is doing particular
well, because you can see what

00:54:12.603 --> 00:54:16.443
prosperity has wrought by this
amazing fountain that we've been

00:54:16.443 --> 00:54:19.726
able to build for the
benefaction of the people of the

00:54:19.726 --> 00:54:21.090
city of Miletus.
 

00:54:21.090 --> 00:54:25.050
And you can see that the scheme
is the same.

00:54:25.050 --> 00:54:26.985
It looks back certainly to the
theatrical architecture,

00:54:26.985 --> 00:54:29.065
to the Second Style painting
and Fourth Style painting that

00:54:29.065 --> 00:54:30.070
we've talked about here.
 

00:54:30.070 --> 00:54:34.650
The same general idea,
with the first story a series

00:54:34.650 --> 00:54:39.409
of double columns with straight
entablatures above;

00:54:39.409 --> 00:54:44.010
in the second story the
addition of pediments,

00:54:44.010 --> 00:54:46.900
in this case triangular
pediments combined with these

00:54:46.900 --> 00:54:50.349
interesting scroll motifs over
some of the pairs of columns.

00:54:50.349 --> 00:54:54.625
And then in the uppermost
story, triangular pediments once

00:54:54.625 --> 00:54:58.016
again,
niches behind them and between

00:54:58.016 --> 00:54:59.489
them,
with statuary,

00:54:59.489 --> 00:55:02.673
as you can also see,
and then pilasters,

00:55:02.673 --> 00:55:06.010
decorative pilasters on the
wall.

00:55:06.010 --> 00:55:08.244
This one also has wings,
but you can see that the wings

00:55:08.244 --> 00:55:10.809
are even more elaborate than the
wings we've seen in any of the

00:55:10.809 --> 00:55:12.900
other structures,
and they, in fact,

00:55:12.900 --> 00:55:16.641
have pediments that face in
toward the central part of the

00:55:16.641 --> 00:55:19.530
structure and toward the
fountain proper.

00:55:19.530 --> 00:55:23.851
Ward-Perkins has added a few
figures here that give you a

00:55:23.851 --> 00:55:28.481
sense once again of the enormity
of the scale of this amazing

00:55:28.481 --> 00:55:31.260
fountain in the city of Miletus.
 

00:55:31.260 --> 00:55:35.190
I mentioned that although I was
going to concentrate today on

00:55:35.190 --> 00:55:38.989
baroque architecture in the
eastern part of the Empire,

00:55:38.989 --> 00:55:43.519
I would show at least one
example from the West,

00:55:43.519 --> 00:55:46.449
and I show that to you here.
 

00:55:46.449 --> 00:55:49.882
It takes us back to North
Africa, to a place called

00:55:49.882 --> 00:55:54.072
Sabratha, which is located in
between Timgad and Leptis Magna,

00:55:54.072 --> 00:55:56.268
that we looked at last time.
 

00:55:56.268 --> 00:56:00.123
Here's the site of Sabratha,
and you can see that it too is

00:56:00.123 --> 00:56:01.518
located on the sea.
 

00:56:01.518 --> 00:56:07.050
An extraordinary theater was
built there,

00:56:07.050 --> 00:56:09.947
and it's another example of the
way in which these baroque

00:56:09.947 --> 00:56:13.050
façades could be used for
a whole host of buildings;

00:56:13.050 --> 00:56:17.076
it could be used for theaters
and for temples and for

00:56:17.076 --> 00:56:21.179
fountains and for libraries and
so on and so forth.

00:56:21.179 --> 00:56:25.940
But theater architecture it was
particularly appropriate for,

00:56:25.940 --> 00:56:28.630
because we've seen,
from the very beginning of

00:56:28.630 --> 00:56:31.653
Rome,
that these kinds of ornate

00:56:31.653 --> 00:56:37.134
columnar schemes were used quite
frequently in theatrical

00:56:37.134 --> 00:56:38.699
architecture.
 

00:56:38.699 --> 00:56:42.449
We are looking at the exterior
of the Theater at Sabratha,

00:56:42.449 --> 00:56:46.134
which you can see from your
Monument List dates to around

00:56:46.134 --> 00:56:46.396
A.D.
 

00:56:46.396 --> 00:56:46.989
200.
 

00:56:46.989 --> 00:56:49.070
It has been re-erected.
 

00:56:49.070 --> 00:56:51.597
Much of it had fallen down,
but once again there was quite

00:56:51.597 --> 00:56:54.081
a bit of--the stone was there,
and so they re-erected the

00:56:54.081 --> 00:56:54.880
façade.
 

00:56:54.880 --> 00:56:57.389
You can see that it,
like pretty much everything

00:56:57.389 --> 00:57:00.219
we've looked at today,
was made out of local stone.

00:57:00.219 --> 00:57:05.050
And you can also see two tiers.
 

00:57:05.050 --> 00:57:07.489
And you can see that although
it's made out of local stone,

00:57:07.489 --> 00:57:10.056
it is very similar to the sort
of thing we saw much earlier in

00:57:10.056 --> 00:57:10.730
Rome itself.
 

00:57:10.730 --> 00:57:14.010
Think of the Theater of
Marcellus.

00:57:14.010 --> 00:57:17.141
Think of the Colosseum:
the scheme of arches with

00:57:17.141 --> 00:57:20.990
pilasters or columns in between
them, engaged into the wall,

00:57:20.990 --> 00:57:23.079
as you can see so well here.
 

00:57:23.079 --> 00:57:24.659
If you look at the view on the
left,

00:57:24.659 --> 00:57:27.909
you will see however that the
stage building of the Theater at

00:57:27.909 --> 00:57:30.199
Sabratha is particularly well
preserved,

00:57:30.199 --> 00:57:35.050
and I want to show you two
views, two spectacular views,

00:57:35.050 --> 00:57:37.617
this one in particular,
which shows you what this

00:57:37.617 --> 00:57:40.612
structure looked like in
antiquity and what it looks like

00:57:40.612 --> 00:57:41.039
now.
 

00:57:41.039 --> 00:57:44.320
And it is another one of these
extraordinary baroque facades,

00:57:44.320 --> 00:57:46.889
again so typical for theatrical
architecture.

00:57:46.889 --> 00:57:49.730
We see the three great niches,
as we often do--

00:57:49.730 --> 00:57:52.822
think of the plan of the
Augustan Theater at Leptis

00:57:52.822 --> 00:57:54.885
Magna,
for example--three great

00:57:54.885 --> 00:57:57.960
niches, these columnar elements
on either side,

00:57:57.960 --> 00:58:00.320
in three stories,
no straddling here,

00:58:00.320 --> 00:58:03.679
they are just on top one
another, as you can see well,

00:58:03.679 --> 00:58:06.809
but a series of four instead of
the usual two.

00:58:06.809 --> 00:58:10.795
But then within the niches
they've also created these

00:58:10.795 --> 00:58:15.010
elements, in this case with two
columns that project;

00:58:15.010 --> 00:58:17.737
they're inside the niche,
they're contained inside the

00:58:17.737 --> 00:58:20.054
niche, but they project in front
of the niche,

00:58:20.054 --> 00:58:22.630
adding even more enlivenment to
the structure.

00:58:22.630 --> 00:58:26.010
Look down below also.
 

00:58:26.010 --> 00:58:28.353
We rarely have the bottom of
the stage preserved,

00:58:28.353 --> 00:58:31.380
but we have it preserved here,
and preserved extremely well.

00:58:31.380 --> 00:58:33.380
The bottom of the stage has
been scalloped.

00:58:33.380 --> 00:58:38.010
It has projecting elements,
with columns.

00:58:38.010 --> 00:58:41.748
And the whole thing is
decorated with sculpture -- so

00:58:41.748 --> 00:58:46.280
many figures that those figures
seem to almost dematerialize the

00:58:46.280 --> 00:58:47.000
stone.
 

00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:48.284
A crowd of figures,
not just a few figures that you

00:58:48.284 --> 00:58:50.764
can read very well,
but a whole host,

00:58:50.764 --> 00:58:54.217
crowds of figures,
that show again this interest

00:58:54.217 --> 00:58:56.159
in over-decoration in these
baroque buildings.

00:58:56.159 --> 00:58:58.760
Here's another view,
not quite as clear,

00:58:58.760 --> 00:59:01.440
but I think a very good one,
that also gives you a very good

00:59:01.440 --> 00:59:03.097
sense,
not only of the stage

00:59:03.097 --> 00:59:05.949
decoration, but of the scale of
the structure,

00:59:05.949 --> 00:59:10.010
because we've got a few
tourists standing here,

00:59:10.010 --> 00:59:14.563
which show you that once again
bigger is better is clearly the

00:59:14.563 --> 00:59:16.579
rallying call of the day.
 

00:59:16.579 --> 00:59:20.760
Here's a detail of some of that
decoration: gods and goddesses

00:59:20.760 --> 00:59:21.789
and the like.
 

00:59:21.789 --> 00:59:24.159
We see the Three Graces here,
for example.

00:59:24.159 --> 00:59:26.570
But you can see the way they
are crowded in,

00:59:26.570 --> 00:59:31.889
to give one a sense of a kind
of excess ornamentation,

00:59:31.889 --> 00:59:36.000
which was obviously very
popular during this period.

00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:39.364
The last set of buildings that
I want to show you are in many

00:59:39.364 --> 00:59:41.610
respects the most interesting of
all,

00:59:41.610 --> 00:59:44.525
and this is a group of
buildings that are part of a

00:59:44.525 --> 00:59:48.309
complex in what is now Lebanon,
the city of Baalbek.

00:59:48.309 --> 00:59:52.387
The so- called Sanctuary of
Jupiter Heliopolitanus at

00:59:52.387 --> 00:59:56.545
Baalbek, which was constructed
over a 200-year period,

00:59:56.545 --> 00:59:59.289
from the mid-first century A.D.
 

00:59:59.289 --> 01:00:02.579
to the mid-third century A.D.
 

01:00:02.579 --> 01:00:07.572
The location of Baalbek is
right over here,

01:00:07.572 --> 01:00:11.260
as I said, in modern Lebanon.
 

01:00:11.260 --> 01:00:15.309
And the remains are incredible,
the remains are incredible.

01:00:15.309 --> 01:00:17.820
Every so often there's,
you know, often fighting.

01:00:17.820 --> 01:00:20.496
This is the Bekaa Valley,
so there's often fighting that

01:00:20.496 --> 01:00:22.980
breaks out in this particular
part of the world,

01:00:22.980 --> 01:00:26.179
and one worries about these
monuments,

01:00:26.179 --> 01:00:31.411
but so far they seem to have
withstood some of the

01:00:31.411 --> 01:00:38.030
difficulties that that area has
experienced in recent years.

01:00:38.030 --> 01:00:40.543
And you see some of them here
in the--it's nicely silhouetted

01:00:40.543 --> 01:00:41.550
against the landscape.
 

01:00:41.550 --> 01:00:45.030
But this gives you a better
idea of what the complex looked

01:00:45.030 --> 01:00:47.849
like in antiquity,
and I show it to you here.

01:00:47.849 --> 01:00:49.960
Again, it was built over a
series of years.

01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:52.637
But let's just talk about it as
a whole, and then I'll break

01:00:52.637 --> 01:00:54.000
down the chronology for you.
 

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:57.090
It had a grand entranceway,
with a single staircase;

01:00:57.090 --> 01:01:02.860
façade orientation,
with an arcuated lintel here,

01:01:02.860 --> 01:01:06.010
contained within a pediment.
 

01:01:06.010 --> 01:01:10.039
Then, interestingly enough,
you went from that entranceway

01:01:10.039 --> 01:01:13.010
into a hexagonal court,
open to the sky.

01:01:13.010 --> 01:01:15.106
From the hexagonal court,
into this great open

01:01:15.106 --> 01:01:17.110
rectangular space,
surrounded by columns.

01:01:17.110 --> 01:01:23.010
A very large altar right here,
to Jupiter,

01:01:23.010 --> 01:01:25.307
because the main temple in this
complex was the Temple to

01:01:25.307 --> 01:01:26.956
Jupiter,
and you see it also in the

01:01:26.956 --> 01:01:28.199
restored view at the back.
 

01:01:28.199 --> 01:01:30.590
So the Altar to Jupiter,
the Temple to Jupiter.

01:01:30.590 --> 01:01:34.050
If you look at the Temple to
Jupiter,

01:01:34.050 --> 01:01:36.550
you will see it's very similar
to the temples that we've been

01:01:36.550 --> 01:01:38.302
looking at over the course of
the semester:

01:01:38.302 --> 01:01:40.057
very tall podium,
single staircase,

01:01:40.057 --> 01:01:43.643
façade orientation,
deep porch, freestanding

01:01:43.643 --> 01:01:47.039
columns in that porch,
and the like.

01:01:47.039 --> 01:01:49.786
And you can also see that there
is another temple right outside

01:01:49.786 --> 01:01:50.849
the walls of this one.
 

01:01:50.849 --> 01:01:52.849
This is the so-called Temple of
Bacchus,

01:01:52.849 --> 01:01:56.139
which is one of the three that
was part of this complex,

01:01:56.139 --> 01:01:59.010
that also seems to have had its
own little courtyard.

01:01:59.010 --> 01:02:01.434
And then down here,
out of the picture,

01:02:01.434 --> 01:02:05.199
a round Temple to Venus that
we're also going to look at.

01:02:05.199 --> 01:02:06.679
This is a restored view of the
same,

01:02:06.679 --> 01:02:09.639
showing you the entranceway,
the hexagonal court,

01:02:09.639 --> 01:02:12.780
the large Temple to Jupiter,
the smaller Temple to Bacchus,

01:02:12.780 --> 01:02:14.840
and the forecourt that it too
would have had,

01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:18.989
as well as this much less
elaborate entranceway into the

01:02:18.989 --> 01:02:20.500
Temple of Bacchus.
 

01:02:20.500 --> 01:02:23.114
This is perhaps the most
spectacular view I've shown you

01:02:23.114 --> 01:02:26.362
all semester of anything;
this is really an awesome

01:02:26.362 --> 01:02:29.579
photograph, I think,
taken from the air.

01:02:29.579 --> 01:02:31.483
Needless to say,
I can't lay credit to this,

01:02:31.483 --> 01:02:32.989
since it was taken from the
air.

01:02:32.989 --> 01:02:37.039
But you see it here,
and it is an amazing,

01:02:37.039 --> 01:02:39.309
amazing photograph,
that really gives you a better

01:02:39.309 --> 01:02:41.949
sense than anything else might
of the current remains,

01:02:41.949 --> 01:02:44.440
where you can see the entrance
gate.

01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:48.369
You can see that the staircase
is a shadow of what it once was;

01:02:48.369 --> 01:02:49.840
it was once much wider.
 

01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:52.400
You can see the hexagonal court
from above.

01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:54.699
You can see the open
rectangular space.

01:02:54.699 --> 01:02:57.579
You can see the bare remains of
the altar.

01:02:57.579 --> 01:03:02.054
And you can see the Temple of
Jupiter, which has its podium,

01:03:02.054 --> 01:03:05.998
not much of its staircase,
and only six columns still

01:03:05.998 --> 01:03:07.059
surviving.
 

01:03:07.059 --> 01:03:09.344
But the Temple of Bacchus
outside the walls,

01:03:09.344 --> 01:03:12.108
much better preserved,
and gives us a very good sense

01:03:12.108 --> 01:03:13.809
of these temples as a whole.
 

01:03:13.809 --> 01:03:15.891
A plan over here,
showing the same:

01:03:15.891 --> 01:03:19.007
the entrance court,
the hexagonal entranceway,

01:03:19.007 --> 01:03:23.541
the open rectangular space,
at A the Temple of Jupiter,

01:03:23.541 --> 01:03:26.010
B, the Temple of Bacchus.
 

01:03:26.010 --> 01:03:29.567
And here an engraving showing
the entranceway,

01:03:29.567 --> 01:03:33.916
with this arcuated lintel,
just as we saw popular in the

01:03:33.916 --> 01:03:37.000
Hadrianic period,
and the pediment.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.393
Now the chronology is that the
Temple of Jupiter was built

01:03:39.393 --> 01:03:40.989
first, in the mid-first century
A.D.

01:03:40.989 --> 01:03:43.096
That's way back,
that's like the time of

01:03:43.096 --> 01:03:45.420
Claudius and Nero:
mid-first century A.D.

01:03:45.420 --> 01:03:52.619
Then in the second century
there were other additions,

01:03:52.619 --> 01:03:58.175
and it was in the third century
that the propylon and the

01:03:58.175 --> 01:04:01.389
hexagonal court--
the second century actually was

01:04:01.389 --> 01:04:04.010
the open rectangular space was
added in the second century,

01:04:04.010 --> 01:04:06.485
and then in the third century
they added the hexagonal court

01:04:06.485 --> 01:04:07.409
and the entranceway.
 

01:04:07.409 --> 01:04:12.010
So moving from the back toward
the front.

01:04:12.010 --> 01:04:14.739
These are the six columns that
are preserved of the Temple of

01:04:14.739 --> 01:04:15.739
Jupiter, at Baalbek.
 

01:04:15.739 --> 01:04:19.750
They are incredibly--the whole
structure is incredibly large.

01:04:19.750 --> 01:04:23.500
This is the biggest building
we've seen thus far.

01:04:23.500 --> 01:04:26.213
We know there were ten columns
in the front,

01:04:26.213 --> 01:04:27.730
nineteen on the sides.
 

01:04:27.730 --> 01:04:31.039
They're again made out of honey
colored local limestone;

01:04:31.039 --> 01:04:36.039
I think, as you can see so well
in both of these views.

01:04:36.039 --> 01:04:39.139
In this case the podium was 44
feet tall, 44 feet tall.

01:04:39.139 --> 01:04:44.625
The podium at the Temple of the
Divi, at the Forum at Leptis

01:04:44.625 --> 01:04:49.739
Magna, was 19 feet tall,
and we thought that was big.

01:04:49.739 --> 01:04:55.041
This is 44 feet tall,
and the columns were 65 feet

01:04:55.041 --> 01:04:55.800
tall.
 

01:04:55.800 --> 01:04:59.969
And remember those columns that
Sulla stole from Greece,

01:04:59.969 --> 01:05:03.228
55 feet tall,
for the Temple of Jupiter OMC,

01:05:03.228 --> 01:05:06.639
these are ten--are much taller
than that.

01:05:06.639 --> 01:05:10.192
So it gives you some sense of
the incredible scale of this

01:05:10.192 --> 01:05:10.940
structure.
 

01:05:10.940 --> 01:05:14.309
Here's a plan of the Temple of
Bacchus, the second temple that

01:05:14.309 --> 01:05:16.905
I want to show you,
that dates to the mid-second

01:05:16.905 --> 01:05:17.789
century A.D.
 

01:05:17.789 --> 01:05:19.210
We see it here.
 

01:05:19.210 --> 01:05:23.010
You can get a very good sense
of its structure,

01:05:23.010 --> 01:05:25.255
and you can see the way in
which it combines typical Roman

01:05:25.255 --> 01:05:26.869
with Greek features:
single staircase,

01:05:26.869 --> 01:05:29.351
façade orientation,
deep porch, freestanding

01:05:29.351 --> 01:05:34.010
columns in the porch,
single cella.

01:05:34.010 --> 01:05:36.909
But it has a peripteral
colonnade, as one finds in Greek

01:05:36.909 --> 01:05:37.699
architecture.
 

01:05:37.699 --> 01:05:40.097
But it doesn't have a
peripteral staircase,

01:05:40.097 --> 01:05:43.440
as I'll show in a moment;
it has rather a high podium.

01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:44.460
Here you see it.
 

01:05:44.460 --> 01:05:46.389
It is very well preserved.
 

01:05:46.389 --> 01:05:51.010
You can see the columns
encircling the whole building.

01:05:51.010 --> 01:05:52.800
But you can see there is no
staircase circling the whole

01:05:52.800 --> 01:05:53.940
building, but a very high
podium.

01:05:53.940 --> 01:05:55.750
A few people here for scale.
 

01:05:55.750 --> 01:05:58.217
This is a big building,
and this building is much

01:05:58.217 --> 01:06:00.119
smaller than the Temple of
Jupiter.

01:06:00.119 --> 01:06:04.039
These buildings are so big that
someone,

01:06:04.039 --> 01:06:06.697
I guess tongue in cheek,
wrote an article at one point

01:06:06.697 --> 01:06:10.010
suggesting that this could not
have been built by human beings,

01:06:10.010 --> 01:06:12.306
Romans or otherwise,
and was definitely built by

01:06:12.306 --> 01:06:15.141
Martians who came down in a
spaceship and built it and then

01:06:15.141 --> 01:06:16.978
left,
but left us with something

01:06:16.978 --> 01:06:19.719
quite extraordinary,
if that was indeed the case.

01:06:19.719 --> 01:06:24.050
Once again overly decorative,
overly decorative.

01:06:24.050 --> 01:06:25.960
If you look at--we could look
at a whole host of details,

01:06:25.960 --> 01:06:28.010
but if you look at them you
will see extraordinary things.

01:06:28.010 --> 01:06:31.090
We're looking up in one of the
vaults, and you can see how it's

01:06:31.090 --> 01:06:33.623
been nearly pretty much eaten
away by this excessive

01:06:33.623 --> 01:06:34.369
decoration.
 

01:06:34.369 --> 01:06:37.760
The same here with this
wonderful Medusa head in the

01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:38.360
center.
 

01:06:38.360 --> 01:06:45.010
No inch is left undecorated by
these architects.

01:06:45.010 --> 01:06:47.248
This is one of the
best-preserved interiors of a

01:06:47.248 --> 01:06:49.679
Roman temple that we have,
the Temple of Bacchus.

01:06:49.679 --> 01:06:51.179
We are looking through the
doorway.

01:06:51.179 --> 01:06:53.110
If you look at the jambs of the
doorway,

01:06:53.110 --> 01:06:57.070
you will see how decorated they
are,

01:06:57.070 --> 01:07:00.286
and again the way in which they
have been dematerialized through

01:07:00.286 --> 01:07:01.360
that ornamentation.
 

01:07:01.360 --> 01:07:08.081
Looking into the interior--and
I can show you a better view

01:07:08.081 --> 01:07:10.554
here--
you get a very good sense of

01:07:10.554 --> 01:07:12.981
what this structure looked like
in antiquity:

01:07:12.981 --> 01:07:15.300
the truly colossal Corinthian
columns,

01:07:15.300 --> 01:07:17.929
in this particular case,
the niches on two stories,

01:07:17.929 --> 01:07:21.675
with arcuated pediments and
with triangular pediments up

01:07:21.675 --> 01:07:26.346
above--
the extraordinary scale of this

01:07:26.346 --> 01:07:30.010
highly decorative interior.
 

01:07:30.010 --> 01:07:32.101
And I can show you a restored
view of what we think this

01:07:32.101 --> 01:07:33.130
looked like in antiquity.
 

01:07:33.130 --> 01:07:36.610
At first glance it doesn't look
so different from the sort of

01:07:36.610 --> 01:07:39.782
Basilica Ulpia idea in Rome,
with the flat ceiling,

01:07:39.782 --> 01:07:45.039
the coffered ceiling,
the giant columns and so on.

01:07:45.039 --> 01:07:46.148
But, of course,
it has no aisles,

01:07:46.148 --> 01:07:47.465
since it's--I mean,
it does, I'm sorry,

01:07:47.465 --> 01:07:48.469
it does have aisles here.
 

01:07:48.469 --> 01:07:51.965
But you can see the arcuations;
you can see the pediments,

01:07:51.965 --> 01:07:54.070
with the sculpture inside.
 

01:07:54.070 --> 01:07:56.039
You can see the Corinthian
capitals.

01:07:56.039 --> 01:08:00.039
And you can see no clerestory
here.

01:08:00.039 --> 01:08:03.340
But you can see a very
interesting feature at the end.

01:08:03.340 --> 01:08:07.806
The focus of everyone who came
into this temple was the

01:08:07.806 --> 01:08:10.693
so-called adyton,
a-d-y-t-o-n,

01:08:10.693 --> 01:08:12.981
adyton,
which is a kind of shrine in

01:08:12.981 --> 01:08:16.359
which the cult statue of Bacchus
would have been presented.

01:08:16.359 --> 01:08:20.038
You can see it well here.
 

01:08:20.038 --> 01:08:24.050
And you can see the use of the
broken triangular pediment,

01:08:24.050 --> 01:08:26.091
but one that is very similar to
that market gate in that the

01:08:26.091 --> 01:08:27.595
central element,
with its triangle,

01:08:27.595 --> 01:08:30.161
still preserved,
but preserved in a plane that

01:08:30.161 --> 01:08:33.801
is further back --
so that kind of zigzag motion

01:08:33.801 --> 01:08:35.359
that we see here.
 

01:08:35.359 --> 01:08:40.265
The great archivolt underneath,
the paired columns on either

01:08:40.265 --> 01:08:43.010
side, the shrine in the center.
 

01:08:43.010 --> 01:08:46.000
A very elaborate motif,
done in the style that we have

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.988
described as baroque for this
incredible structure.

01:08:48.988 --> 01:08:52.680
I want to end today by showing
you my favorite of all the

01:08:52.680 --> 01:08:55.250
buildings that I've shown you
today,

01:08:55.250 --> 01:08:59.320
because it's so eccentric,
and that is the Temple of Venus

01:08:59.320 --> 01:09:00.250
at Baalbek.
 

01:09:00.250 --> 01:09:04.475
It's the small temple that lies
outside the complex,

01:09:04.475 --> 01:09:08.038
to the left of the complex,
in the front.

01:09:08.038 --> 01:09:11.653
And it's the latest of the
three temples--it probably dates

01:09:11.653 --> 01:09:15.079
to early--to mid-third century
A.D.--and also by far the

01:09:15.079 --> 01:09:19.373
smallest;
it's very small in relationship

01:09:19.373 --> 01:09:21.060
to the others.
 

01:09:21.060 --> 01:09:22.780
It is also a round temple,
unlike them,

01:09:22.780 --> 01:09:24.819
which are the traditional
rectangular temples,

01:09:24.819 --> 01:09:25.680
a round temple.
 

01:09:25.680 --> 01:09:29.038
But a round temple with a
difference.

01:09:29.038 --> 01:09:30.899
If we look at the plan,
we will see it has a single

01:09:30.899 --> 01:09:32.759
staircase, a façade
orientation, deep porch,

01:09:32.759 --> 01:09:34.210
freestanding columns in that
porch.

01:09:34.210 --> 01:09:37.490
It also is peripteral;
it has columns that go all the

01:09:37.490 --> 01:09:38.060
way around.
 

01:09:38.060 --> 01:09:40.698
It is a round structure with a
round cella.

01:09:40.698 --> 01:09:46.349
But you can see in plan that
the architect has scalloped the

01:09:46.349 --> 01:09:50.448
outside of the structure,
in a very interesting way,

01:09:50.448 --> 01:09:53.615
and you can see that also in
these restored views over here

01:09:53.615 --> 01:09:55.149
--
that scalloping,

01:09:55.149 --> 01:09:59.484
both on the base and also in
the area of the entablature

01:09:59.484 --> 01:10:01.140
above the columns.
 

01:10:01.140 --> 01:10:06.747
You can also see that the
architect has placed niches on

01:10:06.747 --> 01:10:11.697
the outside of the structure,
with statues in them,

01:10:11.697 --> 01:10:16.197
which is another example of
this desire to decorate every

01:10:16.197 --> 01:10:19.010
surface that one possibly could.
 

01:10:19.010 --> 01:10:21.458
There's a great deal of
controversy as to what the porch

01:10:21.458 --> 01:10:23.685
actually looked like:
whether the porch had what we

01:10:23.685 --> 01:10:26.384
see here,
which is an arcuated lintel

01:10:26.384 --> 01:10:28.689
inside a triangular pediment.
 

01:10:28.689 --> 01:10:29.779
That's possible.
 

01:10:29.779 --> 01:10:35.010
It may not have had that,
we're not absolutely sure.

01:10:35.010 --> 01:10:38.413
But at the very least we have
this combination of what seems

01:10:38.413 --> 01:10:42.050
like a relatively traditional
porch, with an innovative body.

01:10:42.050 --> 01:10:43.761
It is, in a sense,
a small version,

01:10:43.761 --> 01:10:46.430
and a very eccentric version,
of the Pantheon in Rome,

01:10:46.430 --> 01:10:49.198
with that traditional porch and
revolutionary body.

01:10:49.198 --> 01:10:52.231
But this is not made out of
concrete, it is made entirely

01:10:52.231 --> 01:10:53.368
out of local stone.
 

01:10:53.368 --> 01:10:56.422
And again it has these
wonderful features,

01:10:56.422 --> 01:10:58.359
like the scalloped base.
 

01:10:58.359 --> 01:11:02.010
And I show you a detail.
 

01:11:02.010 --> 01:11:03.936
It's very well preserved today,
as are the other buildings,

01:11:03.936 --> 01:11:05.500
or at least the Temple of
Bacchus at Baalbek.

01:11:05.500 --> 01:11:06.630
We see it here.
 

01:11:06.630 --> 01:11:08.390
You can see its stone
construction.

01:11:08.390 --> 01:11:11.800
Unfortunately it's black and
white, but you can get a sense;

01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:13.819
it's the same honey colored
stone as the others.

01:11:13.819 --> 01:11:15.739
You can see the way it looks
here.

01:11:15.739 --> 01:11:18.930
You can see the scalloped base;
the scalloped,

01:11:18.930 --> 01:11:22.046
the wonderful scalloped
entablature, and,

01:11:22.046 --> 01:11:26.100
the overly decorative nature of
that entablature.

01:11:26.100 --> 01:11:29.060
Above, in this case Corinthian
capitals, as you can see.

01:11:29.060 --> 01:11:32.109
Some traditional motifs,
like these hanging garlands.

01:11:32.109 --> 01:11:35.408
The niches here with the
statuary, making the whole into

01:11:35.408 --> 01:11:39.439
a kind of decorative motif;
even the outside of the cella

01:11:39.439 --> 01:11:41.020
becomes decorative.
 

01:11:41.020 --> 01:11:44.738
But look very carefully and you
will see that the bases of the

01:11:44.738 --> 01:11:47.908
columns are five-sided,
to make them work better with

01:11:47.908 --> 01:11:49.310
the scalloped wall.
 

01:11:49.310 --> 01:11:52.408
This is the second time we've
seen bases like this.

01:11:52.408 --> 01:11:55.994
We saw them in the Tomb of
Annia Regilla in Rome,

01:11:55.994 --> 01:12:00.029
a base that had multiple--more
sides than was usual.

01:12:00.029 --> 01:12:02.524
We see that here,
and it's a testimony again to

01:12:02.524 --> 01:12:05.130
the eccentricity of this
particular designer,

01:12:05.130 --> 01:12:08.298
but also to the sort of
anything-goes approach that we

01:12:08.298 --> 01:12:11.408
see in so much of this Roman
baroque architecture.

01:12:11.408 --> 01:12:15.131
And I just, in closing,
the last two images that I'd

01:12:15.131 --> 01:12:20.020
like to show you are a detail of
the Temple of Venus at Baalbek,

01:12:20.020 --> 01:12:24.220
with a temple--with a detail of
a Borromini structure.

01:12:24.220 --> 01:12:26.359
This one is the Borromini
structure.

01:12:26.359 --> 01:12:28.130
This one is the Temple of Venus.
 

01:12:28.130 --> 01:12:30.198
But I think when you look at
views like this,

01:12:30.198 --> 01:12:33.207
you can see the close--you can
see what I mean by defining

01:12:33.207 --> 01:12:36.925
these as baroque buildings,
already in Roman antiquity --

01:12:36.925 --> 01:12:40.608
but you can see the
extraordinary impact that these

01:12:40.608 --> 01:12:44.289
amazing Roman creations had on
the minds and on the

01:12:44.289 --> 01:12:47.310
oeuvres of great
architects,

01:12:47.310 --> 01:12:51.832
like Bernini and Borromini,
in the seventeenth century in

01:12:51.832 --> 01:12:52.479
Italy.
 

01:12:52.479 --> 01:12:53.500
Thank you very much.

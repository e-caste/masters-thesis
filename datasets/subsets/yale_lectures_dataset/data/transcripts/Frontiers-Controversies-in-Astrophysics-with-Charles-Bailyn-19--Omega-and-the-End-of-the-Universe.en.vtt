00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:04.004
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Okay,

00:00:04.004 --> 00:00:08.590
we're talking about the origin
and fate of the Universe.

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:11.680
And let me remind you of the
story so far.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.805
There are basically two sets of
observations that are important

00:00:28.805 --> 00:00:32.298
here.
One is the existence of the

00:00:32.298 --> 00:00:38.783
Hubble Diagram and Hubble's Law,
which is the observational

00:00:38.783 --> 00:00:45.380
relationship between distance
and velocity for galaxies.

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:50.520
And this leads you to the idea
of a universal expansion.

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.631
And the other is what we
discussed last time:

00:01:00.631 --> 00:01:04.900
that if you look back into the
past,

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:11.418
if you observe at a large
distance--that is to say,

00:01:11.418 --> 00:01:19.110
a large lookback time--what you
discover is that things were

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.500
different in the past.

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.979
That the Universe,
as a whole, looked somewhat

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.790
different and,
in particular,

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:40.174
was significantly denser,
which is exactly what you would

00:01:40.174 --> 00:01:44.019
predict if the Universe was
expanding.

00:01:44.019 --> 00:01:52.237
And these two things--these two
observational facts put together

00:01:52.237 --> 00:02:00.193
are really what lead to the idea
of a Universe with a Big Bang

00:02:00.193 --> 00:02:02.020
cosmology.

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.570
And this is great because you
can then use this assumption

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.328
that everything is governed by
the scale factor of the

00:02:14.328 --> 00:02:16.861
Universe.
And the scale factor starts

00:02:16.861 --> 00:02:19.069
either at zero,
or very close to zero,

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:22.912
and gets bigger with time.
And you can use that concept to

00:02:22.912 --> 00:02:25.230
do all sorts of wonderful
things.

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.460
You can describe the past.

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.669
And in particular,
one of the things we did last

00:02:33.669 --> 00:02:36.724
time was to calculate the age of
the Universe from the

00:02:36.724 --> 00:02:39.030
observations of the Hubble
Constant.

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.240
And you can predict the future.

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.837
And the future depends on how
the expansion of the scale

00:02:51.837 --> 00:02:54.620
factor changes.
If the scale factor just

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.863
continues to expand at its
current rate,

00:02:56.863 --> 00:03:00.372
the Universe will continue to
expand and gradually get sparser

00:03:00.372 --> 00:03:02.537
and sparser,
and colder and colder,

00:03:02.537 --> 00:03:06.280
and more and more boring.
But it's not expected that the

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.703
expansion rate stays the same.
It's expected that the

00:03:09.703 --> 00:03:11.995
expansion rate will change.
And, in particular,

00:03:11.995 --> 00:03:14.880
it's expected that the
expansion rate will slow down.

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.368
Why?
Because there's matter in the

00:03:17.368 --> 00:03:20.415
Universe, and matter exerts
gravity, and gravity tends to

00:03:20.415 --> 00:03:24.631
pull things back together again.
And so, this is where we ended

00:03:24.631 --> 00:03:28.766
up last time.
If you assume that gravity is

00:03:28.766 --> 00:03:34.773
the dominant force--that is to
say that any changes in the

00:03:34.773 --> 00:03:40.780
expansion rate of the Universe
will be due to gravity,

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.381
then, you can derive this
critical density,

00:03:44.381 --> 00:03:48.754
which we did last time,
which is a quantity equal to

00:03:48.754 --> 00:03:53.270
3H^(2) / 8 π G.
H, you measure.

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:56.274
The other things are just
constants, and you can calculate

00:03:56.274 --> 00:03:59.360
what this quantity is.
Now, at this point,

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.959
let me write down a piece of
astronomical jargon,

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:09.323
which I didn't do last time.
The actual density of the

00:04:09.323 --> 00:04:13.345
Universe, divided by this
critical density,

00:04:13.345 --> 00:04:19.247
is given a letter of its own.
This is written down as a

00:04:19.247 --> 00:04:22.712
capital Omega.
So Ω is the true--the actual

00:04:22.712 --> 00:04:25.993
density of the Universe,
whatever that turns out to be,

00:04:25.993 --> 00:04:28.120
divided by the critical
density.

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.870
And then, you can describe the
future of the Universe,

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.821
depending on what Ω is.
If Ω is greater than 1,

00:04:33.821 --> 00:04:37.425
that means that the density's
greater than the critical

00:04:37.425 --> 00:04:41.101
density.
And this leads to re-collapse

00:04:41.101 --> 00:04:46.274
and the "Big Crunch"--whereas,
if Ω is less than 1,

00:04:46.274 --> 00:04:49.520
the Universe expands forever.

00:04:56.579 --> 00:04:59.999
Somebody asked,
what happens if Ω is exactly

00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:01.856
equal to 1?
In that case,

00:05:01.856 --> 00:05:05.263
there is no Big Crunch.
The Universe expands forever,

00:05:05.263 --> 00:05:08.759
but the expansion rate
asymptotically approaches zero.

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:10.419
But, of course,
in real life,

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:13.679
it's very hard to get something
that's exactly some--any

00:05:13.679 --> 00:05:16.347
physical quantity to be
precisely equal to any

00:05:16.347 --> 00:05:19.918
theoretical value.
And so, with this in mind,

00:05:19.918 --> 00:05:24.876
it then becomes very important
to actually go out and measure

00:05:24.876 --> 00:05:28.759
the average density of the
Universe because,

00:05:28.759 --> 00:05:32.420
then, you could divide it by
this critical density.

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:35.279
We've already measured
H, so we know what this

00:05:35.279 --> 00:05:37.066
quantity is.
And then, you could figure out

00:05:37.066 --> 00:05:40.187
what's going to happen.
So, the goal here is to

00:05:40.187 --> 00:05:44.100
determine the density of the
Universe.

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:55.675
And conceptually,
this isn't such a hard thing to

00:05:55.675 --> 00:05:57.844
do.
You go out and measure the mass

00:05:57.844 --> 00:06:01.605
of everything you can see.
You try and do it over a large

00:06:01.605 --> 00:06:06.040
volume, because what you want to
avoid--the mistake you want to

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:10.474
avoid is to measure the density
of a piece of the Universe that

00:06:10.474 --> 00:06:13.550
doesn't represent the overall
average.

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:17.041
If we measured the density of
material in this room,

00:06:17.041 --> 00:06:21.148
it would be something like 27
orders of magnitude bigger than

00:06:21.148 --> 00:06:24.021
the critical density.
And if we assume that the

00:06:24.021 --> 00:06:26.065
Universe were just like this
room, obviously,

00:06:26.065 --> 00:06:28.240
it would re-collapse.
In fact, it would have

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:30.864
re-collapsed long ago.
But, we don't do that because,

00:06:30.864 --> 00:06:33.640
of course, most of the Universe
is not like this room.

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:35.933
Most of the Universe is empty.
So, you say,

00:06:35.933 --> 00:06:39.332
well, we better include a lot
of stars and the empty spaces

00:06:39.332 --> 00:06:41.544
between them.
But even that's a mistake,

00:06:41.544 --> 00:06:43.800
because you're measuring stars
in our galaxy.

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:46.595
So, you say,
well, we better include lots of

00:06:46.595 --> 00:06:49.519
galaxies and the empty spaces
between them.

00:06:49.519 --> 00:06:52.727
That still doesn't work for a
while, because there are

00:06:52.727 --> 00:06:56.296
clusters of galaxies.
There are clusters of clusters

00:06:56.296 --> 00:06:59.142
of galaxies.
And so, you have to go really,

00:06:59.142 --> 00:07:01.868
quite far out,
before you have a fair sample

00:07:01.868 --> 00:07:05.610
of what the average conditions
in the Universe are like.

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:08.216
But, in principle,
that's certainly possible to

00:07:08.216 --> 00:07:09.879
do.
You just keep measuring things

00:07:09.879 --> 00:07:12.685
further and further and further
away, until you get to a point

00:07:12.685 --> 00:07:14.134
where,
if you increase the

00:07:14.134 --> 00:07:16.585
distance--where,
as you increase the distance,

00:07:16.585 --> 00:07:18.709
that density doesn't change
anymore.

00:07:18.709 --> 00:07:22.130
So, you're out to the part
where you've really achieved the

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:23.889
average.
How do you know you've achieved

00:07:23.889 --> 00:07:25.950
the average?
Well, you look out twice as far

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:30.578
and you get the same answer.
And so, in principle,

00:07:30.578 --> 00:07:38.698
the way you do this is,
you add up all the mass in some

00:07:38.698 --> 00:07:45.917
sizeable chunk of the
Universe--in a sufficiently

00:07:45.917 --> 00:07:53.570
large chunk of the Universe,
where sufficiently large is

00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:59.550
sufficiently large to average
over any local perturbations.

00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:04.629
So, you add up all the mass and
you divide by the volume.

00:08:04.629 --> 00:08:08.899
You divide by the volume that
that mass occupies.

00:08:08.899 --> 00:08:11.289
And so, obviously,
you have to identify all the

00:08:11.289 --> 00:08:14.639
different kinds of mass.
And you have to make sure that

00:08:14.639 --> 00:08:18.439
whatever volume you've taken,
you've found all the mass in

00:08:18.439 --> 00:08:19.670
it.
You add it all up.

00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:22.504
You divide by volume.
You determine--that gives you a

00:08:22.504 --> 00:08:25.279
value for density.
You divide by the critical

00:08:25.279 --> 00:08:29.010
density and you know what's
going to happen to the Universe.

00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:33.919
Okay.
Now, how do you find the mass

00:08:33.919 --> 00:08:36.549
of things?
Determining mass.

00:08:36.549 --> 00:08:44.539
Well, one way you can do it is
you can just go out and measure

00:08:44.539 --> 00:08:48.600
how bright – yes,
go ahead.

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:50.340
Student: Can you put the
other slide up?

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:52.718
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Oh,

00:08:52.718 --> 00:08:56.250
put this back for a second.
Top part?

00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:58.073
Bottom part?
What do you- Student:

00:08:58.073 --> 00:08:59.318
[Inaudible]
if you don't mind putting it

00:08:59.318 --> 00:09:00.728
on.
Professor Charles

00:09:00.728 --> 00:09:02.190
Bailyn: Yeah,
yeah.

00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:04.796
So, you've determined the
density of the Universe by

00:09:04.796 --> 00:09:08.309
adding up the mass.
Divide it by volume.

00:09:08.309 --> 00:09:10.970
And then, the question becomes,
"How do you determine the

00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:11.350
mass?"

00:09:16.029 --> 00:09:21.984
And one way you can do it is,
you look at how bright things

00:09:21.984 --> 00:09:26.220
are.
Add up the light you see.

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:33.325
And then, you assume some value
for the amount of mass it takes

00:09:33.325 --> 00:09:37.679
to create a certain amount of
light.

00:09:37.679 --> 00:09:41.370
So, that's assuming what's
called a mass-to-light ratio.

00:09:47.299 --> 00:09:49.129
And so, you can do that,
you know.

00:09:49.129 --> 00:09:52.400
If it's the Sun,
then one solar mass produces

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:55.485
one solar luminosity.
If all stars--if all objects

00:09:55.485 --> 00:09:58.137
are exactly like the Sun,
then everything would be like

00:09:58.137 --> 00:10:00.149
that.
It turns out that isn't the

00:10:00.149 --> 00:10:03.690
case, but you can take local
samples of stars and figure out

00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:06.269
what the average mass-to-light
ratio is.

00:10:06.269 --> 00:10:09.216
And if you have some value that
you're happy with,

00:10:09.216 --> 00:10:12.464
of mass-to-light ratio,
then you multiply the amount of

00:10:12.464 --> 00:10:14.690
light by the mass-to-light
ratio,

00:10:14.690 --> 00:10:18.296
and this gives you a mass.
Student: Do you need to

00:10:18.296 --> 00:10:20.472
adjust for distance?
Professor Charles

00:10:20.472 --> 00:10:21.618
Bailyn: Sorry.
Student: Do you need to

00:10:21.618 --> 00:10:22.925
adjust for distance?
Professor Charles

00:10:22.925 --> 00:10:24.701
Bailyn: Well,
what you mean by light is

00:10:24.701 --> 00:10:26.519
the--do you need to adjust for
distance?

00:10:26.519 --> 00:10:29.629
What you mean by light is the
intrinsic light.

00:10:29.629 --> 00:10:32.151
You mean the equivalent of the
absolute magnitude,

00:10:32.151 --> 00:10:34.210
which takes the distance into
account.

00:10:34.210 --> 00:10:37.534
So, what you need to ask is not
how bright it looks,

00:10:37.534 --> 00:10:41.120
but its intrinsic brightness in
this particular case.

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:43.519
Yes.
So, you do need to account for

00:10:43.519 --> 00:10:46.143
the distance,
and so, you need to be thinking

00:10:46.143 --> 00:10:49.423
about absolute magnitude rather
than apparent magnitude,

00:10:49.423 --> 00:10:52.290
yes.
And that's one of the problems.

00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:54.719
That's hard to do.
The other problem,

00:10:54.719 --> 00:10:58.716
of course, is this awkward
word, here ["assume"],

00:10:58.716 --> 00:11:03.379
which is the kind of thing that
makes people nervous,

00:11:03.379 --> 00:11:05.549
because you could get that
wrong.

00:11:05.549 --> 00:11:08.868
If you're looking at one kind
of star and it's actually some

00:11:08.868 --> 00:11:11.739
other kind of star,
which happens to be much more

00:11:11.739 --> 00:11:14.592
massive but dimmer,
like white dwarfs or something

00:11:14.592 --> 00:11:17.714
like that,
then you're going to make a

00:11:17.714 --> 00:11:20.507
mess of this.
So, there's an alternative

00:11:20.507 --> 00:11:23.220
method, which you may already
have considered,

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:26.716
because we've done it in both
of the previous parts of this

00:11:26.716 --> 00:11:33.399
class,
which is, you measure orbits.

00:11:33.399 --> 00:11:37.264
And you do the same thing we
did with--in part one and part

00:11:37.264 --> 00:11:40.184
two of the class.
You find some star in the

00:11:40.184 --> 00:11:44.090
distant portion of the galaxy,
orbiting around the galaxy.

00:11:44.090 --> 00:11:46.590
You figure out how fast the
thing is going.

00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:48.700
You figure out how far the
thing is going.

00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:55.569
You use Kepler's Laws.
And you determine the mass from

00:11:55.569 --> 00:12:01.393
orbital theory,
from Kepler's Laws,

00:12:01.393 --> 00:12:05.213
basically.
And, in particular,

00:12:05.213 --> 00:12:09.489
you know, V^(2) =
GM/a. And so,

00:12:09.489 --> 00:12:13.430
you can measure this from the
Doppler shift.

00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:17.045
You can determine this;
basically, in the case of

00:12:17.045 --> 00:12:18.840
galaxies, galaxies are big
objects.

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:23.740
You can physically measure the
angular separation on the sky.

00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:26.085
Use the small angle formula,
if you know the distance,

00:12:26.085 --> 00:12:28.961
to determine this.
So, this can also be measured,

00:12:28.961 --> 00:12:31.550
and therefore,
this can be calculated.

00:12:37.179 --> 00:12:40.650
And so, you go and do that for
a whole bunch of galaxies.

00:12:40.650 --> 00:12:43.734
And this has been done.
And let me give you some

00:12:43.734 --> 00:12:47.132
examples, here.
Let me actually write down some

00:12:47.132 --> 00:12:49.220
numbers and do some
calculations.

00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:58.974
Supposing you have a galaxy at
a distance of 20 megaparsecs

00:12:58.974 --> 00:13:04.463
[Mpc].
And supposing it has an

00:13:04.463 --> 00:13:11.129
apparent magnitude of,
something like,

00:13:11.129 --> 00:13:14.775
14.
These are kind of typical

00:13:14.775 --> 00:13:18.470
numbers for nearby galaxy
clusters.

00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:22.578
There's a particular--the
nearest big galaxy cluster to us

00:13:22.578 --> 00:13:25.605
is a cluster in the
constellation of Virgo,

00:13:25.605 --> 00:13:29.049
known as the Virgo cluster.
If you want to know about the

00:13:29.049 --> 00:13:30.341
Virgo cluster,
ask Hugh Crowll [

00:13:30.341 --> 00:13:32.176
a graduate teaching assistant
for the course]

00:13:32.176 --> 00:13:34.635
who is devoting his life to the
study of this object and the

00:13:34.635 --> 00:13:37.267
galaxies within it.
But these are sort of

00:13:37.267 --> 00:13:41.098
quasi-typical numbers,
adjusted slightly because it's

00:13:41.098 --> 00:13:44.340
actually 17 Mpc,
which is kind of a pain.

00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:48.365
All right.
So, what do you know about the

00:13:48.365 --> 00:13:51.296
mass?
What can you determine about

00:13:51.296 --> 00:13:55.122
the mass of such a galaxy?
Well--oh, and let me warn you

00:13:55.122 --> 00:13:58.050
before we even begin that,
of course, astronomers have

00:13:58.050 --> 00:14:00.039
played you a dirty
trick--namely,

00:14:00.039 --> 00:14:04.629
that the symbol we use for
magnitude is M.

00:14:04.629 --> 00:14:07.889
The symbol we use for mass is
also M.

00:14:07.889 --> 00:14:10.260
So, you've got to keep those
clear in your mind.

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:13.190
All right.
So, what do we know about this?

00:14:13.190 --> 00:14:16.573
We know the relationship
between apparent and absolute

00:14:16.573 --> 00:14:18.963
magnitude.
And, as I said just a minute

00:14:18.963 --> 00:14:22.673
ago, it's the absolute magnitude
that we need to know in order to

00:14:22.673 --> 00:14:28.421
actually determine anything.
m - M = 5 log

00:14:28.421 --> 00:14:34.081
(D / 10 parsecs).
So, let's figure out the

00:14:34.081 --> 00:14:40.620
right-hand side first.
That's 5 log (2 x 10^(7)).

00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:44.750
That's 20 Mpc.
1 Mpc is 10^(6).

00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:51.760
Over 10.
That's 5 log (2 x 10^(6)).

00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:54.029
Now, what do I do about that?
Let's see.

00:14:54.029 --> 00:15:02.730
That's 5 times log of 10^(6),
that's pretty straightforward,

00:15:02.730 --> 00:15:07.488
plus the log of 2.
Because, if you add logs,

00:15:07.488 --> 00:15:11.250
then you multiply the thing
inside the parentheses.

00:15:11.250 --> 00:15:15.120
So, log (2) + log (10^(6)) =
log (2 x 10^(6)).

00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:22.950
log (10^(6)) = 6.
log (2) = .3.

00:15:22.950 --> 00:15:24.290
It's just a useful number to
know.

00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:29.920
The log of 2 is around .3.
The log of 3 is around .5.

00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:34.679
The log of 5 is around .7.
You could look it up.

00:15:34.679 --> 00:15:39.920
And so, this is equal to 5 x
6.3.

00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:43.640
5 x 6 = 30.
5 x .3 = 1.5.

00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:50.361
So, this is 31.5.
Let me caution you at this

00:15:50.361 --> 00:15:54.007
point.
So, let me give you a little

00:15:54.007 --> 00:16:01.530
side note, here.
Do not approximate magnitudes.

00:16:05.050 --> 00:16:08.925
Why not?
I mean, we approximate

00:16:08.925 --> 00:16:13.017
everything else in this course.
Magnitudes are a logarithmic

00:16:13.017 --> 00:16:17.208
quantity, right?
And so, you don't approximate

00:16:17.208 --> 00:16:23.144
magnitudes for the same reason
that you don't approximate the

00:16:23.144 --> 00:16:25.727
exponents.
You can't say,

00:16:25.727 --> 00:16:30.205
10^(7) is equal to 10^(6).
You can say 7 equals 6,

00:16:30.205 --> 00:16:34.070
but you can't say 10^(7) is
equal to 10^(6),

00:16:34.070 --> 00:16:37.310
because that's a factor of 10
difference, whereas the

00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:41.050
difference between 7 and 6 is
just a little more than 10%.

00:16:41.050 --> 00:16:45.246
Similarly, this .3.
You would have been tempted to

00:16:45.246 --> 00:16:46.820
get rid of it,
right?

00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:50.950
Because who cares about the
difference between 6 and 6.3?

00:16:50.950 --> 00:16:54.440
But, in fact,
it comes out of this log of 2.

00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:59.259
And so, .3 in the log is
actually a factor of 2.

00:16:59.259 --> 00:17:02.960
And so, you got to not
approximate the exponents.

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:04.700
This is important.
Yes?

00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:06.452
Student: Does this mean
we should also try to be more

00:17:06.452 --> 00:17:07.789
precise when we're dealing with
magnitudes?

00:17:07.789 --> 00:17:09.072
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Well,

00:17:09.072 --> 00:17:10.663
yes.
That's saying--I guess that's

00:17:10.663 --> 00:17:12.720
saying the same thing.
You should be more precise.

00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:14.130
That means you shouldn't
approximate.

00:17:14.130 --> 00:17:19.360
Yeah, so, I guess.
But, it's for the same reason

00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:24.329
that you don't approximate the
exponents.

00:17:24.329 --> 00:17:27.690
And it's also true that the
numbers are easier to work with,

00:17:27.690 --> 00:17:31.163
because it turns out that you
add them rather than multiplying

00:17:31.163 --> 00:17:34.410
them most of the time,
so, it's not such a bad thing.

00:17:34.410 --> 00:17:38.930
Anyway, here we are at 31.5,
so what have we got?

00:17:38.930 --> 00:17:45.660
We've m - M =
31.5.

00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:50.440
This M was stated in the
problem to be 14.

00:17:50.440 --> 00:18:00.300
So, 14 - 31.5 = M.
So, M = -17.5.

00:18:05.670 --> 00:18:09.350
Okay.
That's not such a bad number.

00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:12.745
We can work with that.
So, now we know the absolute

00:18:12.745 --> 00:18:14.960
magnitude.
We know how bright the thing is.

00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:18.734
So, now we can figure out how
many times brighter than the Sun

00:18:18.734 --> 00:18:20.779
it is.
Why is that a useful thing?

00:18:20.779 --> 00:18:22.971
Because if you then make the
assumption that the

00:18:22.971 --> 00:18:25.069
mass-to-light ratio is the same
as the Sun,

00:18:25.069 --> 00:18:27.916
that this galaxy consists
entirely of Sun-like stars,

00:18:27.916 --> 00:18:30.270
then you can determine how
massive it is.

00:18:30.270 --> 00:18:36.218
So, let's do that.
How many Suns--and this is the

00:18:36.218 --> 00:18:41.087
other magnitude equation.
This is, you know,

00:18:41.087 --> 00:18:44.583
M_1 –
M_2 is equal

00:18:44.583 --> 00:18:49.803
to--for two different objects,
is equal to -5/2 log of the

00:18:49.803 --> 00:18:55.440
brightness of 1 over the
brightness of the other.

00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:58.609
But I think I want it in the
other form.

00:18:58.609 --> 00:19:03.824
I think I want it in the form
of 10^(-0.4),

00:19:03.824 --> 00:19:09.286
or 10^(-2/5 (M1-M2)) =
b_1 /

00:19:09.286 --> 00:19:14.083
b_2.
This is the exact same

00:19:14.083 --> 00:19:18.392
equation, as you'll recall,
just having been--getting rid

00:19:18.392 --> 00:19:20.927
of the log,
taking everything,

00:19:20.927 --> 00:19:24.410
putting it into 10 to the
something power.

00:19:24.410 --> 00:19:27.689
The reason I want it in this
form is that this is the answer

00:19:27.689 --> 00:19:29.014
I want.
I want b_1 /

00:19:29.014 --> 00:19:33.210
b_2.
I want one to be the galaxy.

00:19:33.210 --> 00:19:38.666
I want two to be the Sun.
So, then, I've got 10^(-2/5),

00:19:38.666 --> 00:19:44.240
and then, the galaxy is -17.5,
that's the absolute magnitude.

00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:50.890
The Sun is 5,
has an absolute magnitude of 5.

00:19:50.890 --> 00:19:54.524
And that's going to give me the
brightness of the galaxy over

00:19:54.524 --> 00:20:03.660
the brightness of the Sun.
That's 10^(-2/5 (22.5)) .

00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:05.269
Let's see.
The minuses cancel out,

00:20:05.269 --> 00:20:06.960
so that's a plus,
actually.

00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:12.100
2/5 x 22.5 – well, let's see.
2 x 22.5 = 45.

00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:18.519
A fifth of 45 is 9.
So, this is equal to 10^(9).

00:20:18.519 --> 00:20:22.235
So, this galaxy is a billion
times brighter than the Sun,

00:20:22.235 --> 00:20:24.690
10^(9) times brighter than the
Sun.

00:20:24.690 --> 00:20:27.295
So, if it were made out of
Sun-like stars,

00:20:27.295 --> 00:20:30.410
it would have a mass of a
billion solar masses.

00:20:30.410 --> 00:20:40.769
So, mass would equal 10^(9)
times the mass of the Sun,

00:20:40.769 --> 00:20:46.952
if all Sun-like stars.
But, it turns out that galaxies

00:20:46.952 --> 00:20:49.650
tend to be somewhat dimmer than
the Sun, per unit mass.

00:20:49.650 --> 00:20:53.793
Most stars are a little bit
less massive than the Sun,

00:20:53.793 --> 00:20:57.611
but a lot less bright.
This is just the way stars turn

00:20:57.611 --> 00:21:00.401
out to be.
And so, typical mass-to-light

00:21:00.401 --> 00:21:04.749
ratios of populations of stars
tend to be on the order of 10,

00:21:04.749 --> 00:21:07.720
or something like that,
times the Sun.

00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:12.551
So, probably it needs to be
more massive,

00:21:12.551 --> 00:21:18.470
because typical stars are
fainter than the Sun.

00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:26.117
Typically, stars are fainter.
So, you could guess and say,

00:21:26.117 --> 00:21:29.636
mass, maybe,
should be, I don't know,

00:21:29.636 --> 00:21:34.720
10 times greater than that,
10^(10) solar masses.

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:38.472
And you can see why this
particular line of reasoning

00:21:38.472 --> 00:21:42.585
starts to get pretty dubious,
because I picked this number

00:21:42.585 --> 00:21:46.253
completely out of the air.
There's actually some modest

00:21:46.253 --> 00:21:48.239
basis for it,
but you could pick other

00:21:48.239 --> 00:21:50.448
numbers.
You could argue about this

00:21:50.448 --> 00:21:53.000
endlessly and you wouldn't get
very far.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.520
Why should it be 10 times the
Sun?

00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:56.290
Maybe it's 100.
Maybe it's 1,000.

00:21:56.290 --> 00:21:59.210
Maybe it's less than the Sun.
How would you really know?

00:21:59.210 --> 00:22:04.644
And so, let's go back and do
the other approach--namely,

00:22:04.644 --> 00:22:09.980
figure out its mass from orbits
of things around it.

00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:13.279
So, let's look at--supposing
it's an edge-on galaxy.

00:22:13.279 --> 00:22:16.572
Here's the center of the
galaxy, or--and,

00:22:16.572 --> 00:22:20.029
actually, let's look at it from
the top.

00:22:20.029 --> 00:22:22.930
So, here's a nice spiral galaxy
of some kind.

00:22:22.930 --> 00:22:24.430
Here's the center of the spiral
galaxy.

00:22:24.430 --> 00:22:27.359
Here's some star way out on the
edge.

00:22:27.359 --> 00:22:31.029
That star is moving around the
center of the galaxy.

00:22:31.029 --> 00:22:32.829
It has to be,
or it's going to fall in.

00:22:32.829 --> 00:22:35.020
So, it's orbiting around the
center of the galaxy,

00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:36.630
presumably in some circular
orbit.

00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:40.190
You're down here,
looking at this thing.

00:22:40.190 --> 00:22:42.247
And, of course,
you can measure the velocity of

00:22:42.247 --> 00:22:44.932
that star by the Doppler shift,
because it's moving away from

00:22:44.932 --> 00:22:47.743
you.
And so, one can measure this

00:22:47.743 --> 00:22:52.269
velocity.
You can measure this distance.

00:22:52.269 --> 00:22:55.660
That would be the equivalent of
a in our formulas,

00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:59.051
because it's the distance
between the orbiting object and

00:22:59.051 --> 00:23:01.541
the center.
Stars are much less massive

00:23:01.541 --> 00:23:05.174
than galaxies so we don't have
to worry about the motion of the

00:23:05.174 --> 00:23:08.058
galaxy.
And you can use a familiar

00:23:08.058 --> 00:23:11.859
equation--namely,
V^(2) = GM /

00:23:11.859 --> 00:23:15.194
a.
So, now, let's give this some

00:23:15.194 --> 00:23:17.745
numbers.
Typical velocities of things

00:23:17.745 --> 00:23:21.634
orbiting around the galaxy turn
out to be something like 200

00:23:21.634 --> 00:23:27.569
kilometers a second,
or 2 x 10^(5) meters per second.

00:23:27.569 --> 00:23:30.416
And the size of a typical
galaxy, you know,

00:23:30.416 --> 00:23:33.670
out to where it stops being
easy to see stars is,

00:23:33.670 --> 00:23:37.060
oh, I don't know,
what number did I take here?

00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:48.019
Yeah.
Let's call it 20 kiloparsecs,

00:23:48.019 --> 00:23:55.386
which is 2 x 10^(4) parsecs.
And a parsec is 3 x 10^(16)

00:23:55.386 --> 00:24:00.329
meters.
So, this is 6 x 10^(20) meters.

00:24:00.329 --> 00:24:03.660
So, now, let's calculate
M.

00:24:03.660 --> 00:24:14.546
M = V^(2) a /
G. [(2 x 10^(5))^(2)(6 x

00:24:14.546 --> 00:24:19.990
10^(20))]
/ (7 x 10^(-11)).

00:24:19.990 --> 00:24:30.694
Get rid of those--let's see,
that's (4 x 10^(30)) /

00:24:30.694 --> 00:24:34.398
10^(-11).
4 x 10^(41),

00:24:34.398 --> 00:24:39.315
this is in kilograms.
One solar mass,

00:24:39.315 --> 00:24:45.642
you recall, is 2 x 10^(30).
So, this mass,

00:24:45.642 --> 00:24:51.935
in units of the Sun,
(4 x 10^(41)) / (2 x 10^(30)),

00:24:51.935 --> 00:24:58.480
which is something like 2 x
10^(11) solar masses.

00:25:03.109 --> 00:25:06.269
And now, we have a problem,
right?

00:25:06.269 --> 00:25:09.779
You probably don't remember
what the answer to the previous

00:25:09.779 --> 00:25:13.289
version of this problem was,
where we did it with light.

00:25:13.289 --> 00:25:19.570
That came out to a magnitude
of--the brightness was about

00:25:19.570 --> 00:25:24.110
10^(9) times the Sun.
Maybe the mass is 10^(10) times

00:25:24.110 --> 00:25:26.298
the Sun.
But now we've just calculated

00:25:26.298 --> 00:25:28.250
it in this other,
more reliable way,

00:25:28.250 --> 00:25:31.989
and it's 2 x 10^(11).
It's 20 times more massive than

00:25:31.989 --> 00:25:36.787
you thought it was going to be,
given how bright the light from

00:25:36.787 --> 00:25:39.150
this thing was.
Yes, question?

00:25:39.150 --> 00:25:39.970
Student: [Inaudible]
mass of the galaxy?

00:25:39.970 --> 00:25:42.083
Professor Charles
Bailyn: This is the mass of

00:25:42.083 --> 00:25:44.601
the galaxy, yes.
Now, before I go on let me just

00:25:44.601 --> 00:25:47.973
point out--those of you who have
taken a look at the problem

00:25:47.973 --> 00:25:51.200
set--what I've just done here,
this calculation I've just

00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:53.829
done, is problem one of the
problem set, except done

00:25:53.829 --> 00:25:55.992
backwards.
On the problem set,

00:25:55.992 --> 00:25:59.214
what I did is,
I told you what the density

00:25:59.214 --> 00:26:02.200
was, what the critical density
was,

00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:07.204
and then, you had to derive
characteristics of the galaxies

00:26:07.204 --> 00:26:09.560
from that.
Here I've told you what the

00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:13.208
galaxies are like.
We figured out how big--how

00:26:13.208 --> 00:26:17.489
massive they are.
If we divide by the volume,

00:26:17.489 --> 00:26:20.364
we'll get a density.
So, we're doing the same

00:26:20.364 --> 00:26:21.872
problem backwards.
I should say,

00:26:21.872 --> 00:26:24.303
the numbers I've chosen here
are different,

00:26:24.303 --> 00:26:27.835
so, you can't know the answer
to the problem set by looking at

00:26:27.835 --> 00:26:30.440
the premises of these particular
things.

00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:34.480
But, what I'm doing is the
exact same set of calculations,

00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:38.432
only done backwards.
So, that may or may not be

00:26:38.432 --> 00:26:41.955
helpful.
But let's pause here for a

00:26:41.955 --> 00:26:47.140
moment, because this is
now--we're now up to--we're

00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:51.672
making progress.
We're now up to Frontiers and

00:26:51.672 --> 00:26:53.970
Controversies circa 1985.

00:27:01.829 --> 00:27:03.581
You'll remember,
in 1920, they were worried

00:27:03.581 --> 00:27:06.000
about whether the spiral nebulae
were actually galaxies.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.238
In 1950 they were worried
about, maybe the "steady state"

00:27:09.238 --> 00:27:14.162
was the correct response.
And by the time 1985 rolls

00:27:14.162 --> 00:27:22.569
around, the big issue is mass is
determined by orbital rotation.

00:27:22.569 --> 00:27:30.793
So, what you might call
dynamical masses--that is to

00:27:30.793 --> 00:27:39.500
say, determined by orbits of
things around galaxies.

00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:44.625
Orbits around galaxies.
And also, I should say,

00:27:44.625 --> 00:27:47.995
galaxy clusters.
You can have galaxies orbiting

00:27:47.995 --> 00:27:51.947
around each other and galaxies
orbiting around whole clusters

00:27:51.947 --> 00:27:54.779
of galaxies, and the same thing
is true.

00:27:54.779 --> 00:28:05.861
And so, around galaxies and
galaxy clusters--are much bigger

00:28:05.861 --> 00:28:14.690
than you expect from the light
they give off.

00:28:14.690 --> 00:28:20.220
And therefore--by about a
factor of 10.

00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:24.159
By approximately a factor of 10.
So, there's 10 times more mass

00:28:24.159 --> 00:28:27.180
than you can account for by
adding up all the stars.

00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:30.090
Now, there's mass in other
forms than stars.

00:28:30.090 --> 00:28:34.369
There's also dust.
There's also gas.

00:28:34.369 --> 00:28:36.740
These are things you can detect
in other ways.

00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:41.678
You add them all up and you're
still off by about a factor of

00:28:41.678 --> 00:28:44.071
10.
So, there's 10 times more mass

00:28:44.071 --> 00:28:46.779
than you have any way of
accounting for.

00:28:46.779 --> 00:28:52.480
This is the so-called dark
matter problem.

00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:56.730
So, this is Frontiers and
Controversies in 1985.

00:28:56.730 --> 00:29:00.964
There's all this dark matter.
Most of the matter in galaxies

00:29:00.964 --> 00:29:03.250
is in some form that we can't
detect.

00:29:03.250 --> 00:29:05.560
It's dark matter,
and what is it?

00:29:09.279 --> 00:29:12.760
Now, unlike Frontiers and
Controversies in 1920 and 1950,

00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:16.366
this is one that we haven't
solved yet, so I don't know the

00:29:16.366 --> 00:29:18.655
answer.
For a quarter of a century,

00:29:18.655 --> 00:29:21.570
people have been busy trying to
figure this out.

00:29:21.570 --> 00:29:25.122
There's still no good answer.
And ten years ago,

00:29:25.122 --> 00:29:28.520
when I taught this course,
this question of what is the

00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:32.170
dark matter was a big focus of
this part of the course.

00:29:32.170 --> 00:29:36.362
Now, I'm going to talk about it
only in this class,

00:29:36.362 --> 00:29:40.134
only in one lecture,
because we got way bigger

00:29:40.134 --> 00:29:42.650
problems, even,
than this.

00:29:42.650 --> 00:29:45.967
That's saying a lot.
I've just told you that we

00:29:45.967 --> 00:29:49.059
don't know what 90% of the mass
in the Universe is,

00:29:49.059 --> 00:29:52.089
and then, we've got bigger
problems than that.

00:29:52.089 --> 00:29:56.207
So, things are getting a little
murky, here, and not just

00:29:56.207 --> 00:30:01.480
because the matter is dark.
Okay.

00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:03.968
But, let me pause a little bit
on dark matter,

00:30:03.968 --> 00:30:06.069
because it's an interesting
problem.

00:30:06.069 --> 00:30:09.471
And, as I say,
we have no idea what this stuff

00:30:09.471 --> 00:30:11.700
is.
What are the possibilities?

00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:20.875
So, here's a hypothesis.
Hypothesis #1 is that what this

00:30:20.875 --> 00:30:29.400
stuff is, is some kind of
unknown sub-atomic particle.

00:30:34.859 --> 00:30:37.148
And it has to have two
characteristics,

00:30:37.148 --> 00:30:39.980
this sub-atomic particle,
for it to work out.

00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:43.240
It has to have mass.
That's pretty basic.

00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:45.779
If you're using it to explain
mass, you can't have photons,

00:30:45.779 --> 00:30:48.180
right?
Photons don't carry any mass.

00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:53.565
It has to have mass,
but it has to not interact with

00:30:53.565 --> 00:31:01.740
light.
No interaction with light.

00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:03.823
If it absorbs light,
it would be opaque,

00:31:03.823 --> 00:31:06.974
and we would know it was there,
because galaxies behind this

00:31:06.974 --> 00:31:09.743
stuff would look dim.
Alternatively,

00:31:09.743 --> 00:31:13.940
if it gives off light,
then we'd see it.

00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:17.958
And so, it has to not interact
with light, or interact with

00:31:17.958 --> 00:31:24.190
light only very weakly.
And so, these are given the

00:31:24.190 --> 00:31:31.525
name, generically,
Weakly Interactive Massive

00:31:31.525 --> 00:31:37.233
Particles, or WIMPs.
So, here's the hypothesis:

00:31:37.233 --> 00:31:41.440
the Universe is 90% WIMPs.
This is not such a crazy idea

00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:43.700
as it might, at first,
seem.

00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:47.437
There are known sub-atomic
particles that have these

00:31:47.437 --> 00:31:49.760
properties.
There's something called the

00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:51.512
neutrino.
There are trillions of them

00:31:51.512 --> 00:31:53.289
going through this room every
second.

00:31:53.289 --> 00:31:57.705
They have mass and they don't
interact very much with

00:31:57.705 --> 00:32:00.367
anything.
They're known to exist from

00:32:00.367 --> 00:32:03.630
particle accelerator
experiments, and they have been

00:32:03.630 --> 00:32:07.373
detected from celestial sources.
Now, we know that--for various

00:32:07.373 --> 00:32:10.380
reasons, that the dark matter
doesn't consist of neutrinos.

00:32:10.380 --> 00:32:14.200
But, there could be many other
kinds of particles with these

00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:17.762
kinds of characteristics,
and indeed, some are predicted

00:32:17.762 --> 00:32:21.479
by current particle theories.
As I say, WIMPs have been

00:32:21.479 --> 00:32:24.575
detected--I'm sorry,
WIMPs have not been detected,

00:32:24.575 --> 00:32:26.850
but neutrinos have been
detected.

00:32:26.850 --> 00:32:28.761
Here's how they do it.
It's kind of an amazing

00:32:28.761 --> 00:32:31.842
experiment.
They took a mineshaft in South

00:32:31.842 --> 00:32:35.569
Dakota and filled it with
cleaning fluid.

00:32:35.569 --> 00:32:38.866
And the reason they did that
was that every so

00:32:38.866 --> 00:32:42.823
often--neutrinos don't interact
with light, but they do

00:32:42.823 --> 00:32:46.339
interact, occasionally,
with chlorine atoms.

00:32:46.339 --> 00:32:50.192
And the effect of a neutrino
banging into a chlorine atom is

00:32:50.192 --> 00:32:53.644
to turn it into argon.
And so, this happens--there

00:32:53.644 --> 00:32:56.505
are--as I say,
trillions of neutrinos flow

00:32:56.505 --> 00:32:59.399
this mine every second.
Once a day or so,

00:32:59.399 --> 00:33:02.385
one of them will hit a chlorine
atom just right,

00:33:02.385 --> 00:33:05.049
create an argon atom.
So, here's what you do.

00:33:05.049 --> 00:33:07.184
You fill your mineshaft with
cleaning fluid,

00:33:07.184 --> 00:33:09.914
a large fraction of which is
chlorine, and you count the

00:33:09.914 --> 00:33:11.900
argon atoms that bubble off the
top.

00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:16.705
And this has been successful.
They detected neutrinos emitted

00:33:16.705 --> 00:33:19.959
from the Sun.
The Sun is--all stars that have

00:33:19.959 --> 00:33:24.023
nuclear reactions going on in
them, emit neutrinos as part of

00:33:24.023 --> 00:33:26.799
the output of these nuclear
reactions.

00:33:26.799 --> 00:33:30.357
And then, they had a problem,
because they had predicted how

00:33:30.357 --> 00:33:34.155
many neutrinos you ought to see
from the Sun in an experiment of

00:33:34.155 --> 00:33:36.458
this kind,
and they didn't see enough of

00:33:36.458 --> 00:33:38.740
them.
They only saw a third of them.

00:33:38.740 --> 00:33:41.514
And it turns out--and then,
there was a big debate for a

00:33:41.514 --> 00:33:43.637
long time.
This is Frontiers and

00:33:43.637 --> 00:33:47.557
Controversies circa about 1975.
There was a big debate for a

00:33:47.557 --> 00:33:49.184
while.
Where are all the solar

00:33:49.184 --> 00:33:51.385
neutrinos?
Is it possible that we don't

00:33:51.385 --> 00:33:53.750
understand nuclear reactions in
the Sun?

00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:57.966
Is it possible that we don't
understand the chemistry of

00:33:57.966 --> 00:34:00.793
chlorine or argon?
After all, you're counting

00:34:00.793 --> 00:34:03.381
individual argon atoms,
so that's kind of a difficult

00:34:03.381 --> 00:34:05.640
task.
No, it turned out that what was

00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:08.400
going on was,
we didn't understand neutrinos.

00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:10.760
And it turns out there are
three kinds of neutrinos.

00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:14.013
And neutrinos switch back and
forth between these different

00:34:14.013 --> 00:34:17.380
kinds, and you could only detect
one kind by the chlorine.

00:34:17.380 --> 00:34:21.983
And so, they were all emitted
from the Sun as if they were in

00:34:21.983 --> 00:34:26.280
the form that you would have
been able to detect them.

00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:29.529
But as they traveled from the
Sun to us, some fraction of them

00:34:29.529 --> 00:34:32.460
flipped back and forth between
all these other kinds,

00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:35.309
and you ended up only with
about a third of them.

00:34:35.309 --> 00:34:37.770
So, it was a big piece of
particle physics that was

00:34:37.770 --> 00:34:40.259
discovered.
We have also detected,

00:34:40.259 --> 00:34:44.630
by now, neutrinos coming from
supernova explosions.

00:34:44.630 --> 00:34:48.083
So, there are--11 of them,
I think, were detected,

00:34:48.083 --> 00:34:50.854
all at once.
And if you're detecting things,

00:34:50.854 --> 00:34:53.906
sort of, once per day,
and then you suddenly detect 11

00:34:53.906 --> 00:34:56.440
of them over the course of a few
minutes,

00:34:56.440 --> 00:34:59.170
you've seen something exciting
occur.

00:34:59.170 --> 00:35:03.588
And that is now known to be
this supernova explosion that

00:35:03.588 --> 00:35:06.349
occurred in a neighboring
galaxy.

00:35:06.349 --> 00:35:09.484
And so, there are a bunch
of--so, by analogy with that,

00:35:09.484 --> 00:35:12.561
people are looking for the
WIMPs that make up the dark

00:35:12.561 --> 00:35:14.501
matter.
If all this dark matter is in

00:35:14.501 --> 00:35:16.701
WIMPs, there are lots,
and lots, and lots of these

00:35:16.701 --> 00:35:19.079
things, and they're going
through us every second.

00:35:19.079 --> 00:35:23.133
So, there are a whole bunch of
experiments with the same basic

00:35:23.133 --> 00:35:25.772
characteristics.
You have a huge vat of

00:35:25.772 --> 00:35:28.789
something, and something is
supposed to happen,

00:35:28.789 --> 00:35:31.479
occasionally,
when one of these WIMPs hits

00:35:31.479 --> 00:35:34.698
whatever's in the vat.
So, the Japanese have,

00:35:34.698 --> 00:35:37.333
sort of, a cubic mile of
distilled water,

00:35:37.333 --> 00:35:41.350
and they're looking for little
light flashes when the neutrino

00:35:41.350 --> 00:35:44.968
runs into the water molecule.
They busted all their detectors

00:35:44.968 --> 00:35:46.969
recently, and they had a sort of
earthquake,

00:35:46.969 --> 00:35:49.747
and it was bad for the little
light detectors they had put on

00:35:49.747 --> 00:35:52.919
the inside of these things.
But there are a lot of such

00:35:52.919 --> 00:35:54.517
experiments.
Dan McKinsey,

00:35:54.517 --> 00:35:58.050
here in the Physics Department,
is a big player in one of them.

00:35:58.050 --> 00:36:02.404
And the hope is that you will
see the interaction between one

00:36:02.404 --> 00:36:05.306
of these WIMPs,
of which there must be an

00:36:05.306 --> 00:36:08.500
incredibly large number,
with something.

00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:13.023
This has, so far, failed.
So, there is no direct evidence

00:36:13.023 --> 00:36:14.427
from WIMPs.
The other hope,

00:36:14.427 --> 00:36:16.197
I should say,
is that every time you build a

00:36:16.197 --> 00:36:18.021
bigger collider,
you make new kinds of

00:36:18.021 --> 00:36:20.401
sub-atomic particles,
and that they'll eventually

00:36:20.401 --> 00:36:23.030
make something that looks like
it could be a WIMP.

00:36:23.030 --> 00:36:25.420
And that hasn't been--happened
either.

00:36:25.420 --> 00:36:35.989
So, no detections yet.
No direct detections.

00:36:35.989 --> 00:36:38.980
With considerable effort,
you know, this is going to turn

00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:41.329
out to be 90% of the mass in the
Universe.

00:36:41.329 --> 00:36:44.013
So, you would like to detect it
because if you do,

00:36:44.013 --> 00:36:47.538
they'll give you a Nobel Prize.
All right, that's one

00:36:47.538 --> 00:36:51.190
hypothesis.
There's another hypothesis.

00:36:51.190 --> 00:36:54.230
So, here's Hypothesis #2.

00:36:58.559 --> 00:37:01.408
It's just, you know,
dark chunks of something that

00:37:01.408 --> 00:37:05.599
doesn't glow.
Ordinary matter--chunks.

00:37:05.599 --> 00:37:07.593
Student: Do these
hypotheses exist today or

00:37:07.593 --> 00:37:08.855
[inaudible]
Professor Charles

00:37:08.855 --> 00:37:10.727
Bailyn: Yes,
yes, yes, all of the--we don't

00:37:10.727 --> 00:37:12.517
know what it is,
and so, nothing has yet been

00:37:12.517 --> 00:37:14.735
ruled out.
What happens is that they--you

00:37:14.735 --> 00:37:17.210
know, they continue to conduct
these experiments,

00:37:17.210 --> 00:37:19.236
so, you can rule out WIMPs with
certain kinds of

00:37:19.236 --> 00:37:21.262
characteristics,
because you would have detected

00:37:21.262 --> 00:37:22.619
them.
Similarly, you can rule out

00:37:22.619 --> 00:37:24.594
some of these other things with
certain characteristics,

00:37:24.594 --> 00:37:26.389
because you would have noticed
they were there.

00:37:26.389 --> 00:37:29.820
But both of these hypotheses
are still more or less viable.

00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:35.510
Chunks of ordinary matter that
just don't glow,

00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:40.690
that don't emit light.
Now, there's some limitations.

00:37:40.690 --> 00:37:46.174
These chunks can't be too
small, because if what you've

00:37:46.174 --> 00:37:49.728
got are tiny,
you know, micron-sized

00:37:49.728 --> 00:37:53.874
particles, we call that dust.
And, basically,

00:37:53.874 --> 00:37:56.119
that's what it is.
It would just be dust.

00:37:56.119 --> 00:37:59.411
The problem with dust is,
dust in large quantities is

00:37:59.411 --> 00:38:01.880
opaque, and you can't see
through it.

00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:04.735
And therefore,
you would know it was there,

00:38:04.735 --> 00:38:08.269
because it obscures the light
of things behind it.

00:38:08.269 --> 00:38:10.563
And, indeed,
we see cosmic dust this way all

00:38:10.563 --> 00:38:12.588
the time.
It's just, there isn't nearly

00:38:12.588 --> 00:38:15.713
enough of it to account for any
substantial fraction of the dark

00:38:15.713 --> 00:38:21.701
matter.
So, dust would be observed

00:38:21.701 --> 00:38:33.873
because it--by obscuring light.
And it also tends to glow in

00:38:33.873 --> 00:38:38.111
the infrared.
And so, we know that dusts

00:38:38.111 --> 00:38:40.881
exists but we can count how much
of it there is,

00:38:40.881 --> 00:38:44.357
because it obscures light and
it makes its presence known in

00:38:44.357 --> 00:38:47.173
other ways.
It's also true that these

00:38:47.173 --> 00:38:50.469
chunks of ordinary matter can't
be too big.

00:38:50.469 --> 00:38:54.627
They can't be the size of whole
galaxies, or even a substantial

00:38:54.627 --> 00:38:58.560
fraction of a galaxy.
You can't take all your dark

00:38:58.560 --> 00:39:03.684
matter and put it into one lump
per galaxy, or even 100 lumps

00:39:03.684 --> 00:39:08.210
per galaxy because if they were
very large masses,

00:39:08.210 --> 00:39:14.892
you'd see it,
because it would disrupt the

00:39:14.892 --> 00:39:20.760
orbits of stars around the
galaxy.

00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:23.702
So, if there was some huge
unknown mass,

00:39:23.702 --> 00:39:26.570
you'd see things orbiting
around it.

00:39:26.570 --> 00:39:29.441
And, in fact, we do.
We see these supermassive black

00:39:29.441 --> 00:39:32.250
holes in the centers of galaxies
and we know they're there,

00:39:32.250 --> 00:39:35.951
because we see stars orbiting
around them, just like the

00:39:35.951 --> 00:39:40.550
problem on the last Midterm.
And so, it can't be too small.

00:39:40.550 --> 00:39:43.295
It can't be too big.
But, you could,

00:39:43.295 --> 00:39:47.843
perhaps, have,
sort of, a bunch of star

00:39:47.843 --> 00:39:52.160
massed;
so, you could have sort of a

00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:57.621
bunch of star massed,
or planet massed dark things

00:39:57.621 --> 00:40:01.895
in--it would have to be,
for various technical reasons

00:40:01.895 --> 00:40:04.165
that I won't go into,
it has to be in the outer parts

00:40:04.165 --> 00:40:09.449
of galaxies,
in the halos of galaxies.

00:40:09.449 --> 00:40:11.090
So, that, in principle is
possible.

00:40:11.090 --> 00:40:13.190
We wouldn't have any direct way
of detecting them.

00:40:13.190 --> 00:40:24.181
These things are called Massive
Astrophysical Compact Halo

00:40:24.181 --> 00:40:28.949
Objects.
[Laughter] Some people get it.

00:40:28.949 --> 00:40:31.199
Massive, because they have to
carry mass.

00:40:31.199 --> 00:40:33.219
Astrophysical,
because they're not particles.

00:40:33.219 --> 00:40:35.543
Compact, because if they were
big you'd--you know,

00:40:35.543 --> 00:40:37.440
they'd block light and you'd
see them.

00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:40.280
Halo, because that's the part
of the galaxy they're in.

00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:44.795
These are MACHOs, right?
And so, the alternative to

00:40:44.795 --> 00:40:47.414
WIMPs is MACHOs.
And so, the alternative

00:40:47.414 --> 00:40:51.039
explanation is that 90% of the
Universe is MACHOs.

00:40:51.039 --> 00:40:54.938
There's been a very clever
experiment carried out to try

00:40:54.938 --> 00:40:58.699
and find these things.
Here's how you do it.

00:40:58.699 --> 00:41:00.660
You do it with gravitational
lensing.

00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:16.010
Lensing MACHO searches;
remember gravitational lensing?

00:41:16.010 --> 00:41:19.190
This is this business that mass
bends light.

00:41:19.190 --> 00:41:23.719
So, here you are.
You're looking at some star.

00:41:23.719 --> 00:41:28.740
And, in between you and the
star is a MACHO of some kind.

00:41:28.740 --> 00:41:32.294
So, here's the MACHO.
You can't see the MACHO,

00:41:32.294 --> 00:41:37.507
but the presence of the MACHO
changes the direction of the

00:41:37.507 --> 00:41:41.011
light.
So, it comes into you like

00:41:41.011 --> 00:41:45.239
this, and it basically acts like
a lens.

00:41:45.239 --> 00:41:50.625
And, in particular,
the way it acts like a lens,

00:41:50.625 --> 00:41:56.355
in the case of MACHOs lensing
stars, is it makes it

00:41:56.355 --> 00:42:00.710
brighter--makes the star
brighter.

00:42:00.710 --> 00:42:03.886
Now, in order for this to work,
the alignment has to be

00:42:03.886 --> 00:42:07.055
essentially perfect.
All of these objects are moving

00:42:07.055 --> 00:42:09.432
around.
They're orbiting the galaxy and

00:42:09.432 --> 00:42:16.001
stuff.
So, the alignment holds for a

00:42:16.001 --> 00:42:21.987
few weeks, typically.
So, what you'll see is,

00:42:21.987 --> 00:42:24.469
you'll see this star become
much brighter.

00:42:24.469 --> 00:42:26.998
And it can really become much
brighter--we're talking tens to

00:42:26.998 --> 00:42:29.190
hundreds of times brighter than
it ordinarily was.

00:42:29.190 --> 00:42:32.710
This lasts for a few weeks,
and then, it goes away.

00:42:32.710 --> 00:42:36.164
These have been observed.
These lensing events have been

00:42:36.164 --> 00:42:44.320
observed.
Lensing events observed.

00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:54.210
But there are too few of them
to explain the dark matter.

00:42:54.210 --> 00:42:56.190
Now, there are still ways out.
Let's see.

00:42:56.190 --> 00:42:59.967
If you have particularly low
mass MACHOs, so--supposing the

00:42:59.967 --> 00:43:04.070
whole Universe is filled with
things about the mass of Earth,

00:43:04.070 --> 00:43:11.210
those cause lensing events that
might be too small to see.

00:43:11.210 --> 00:43:13.603
Alternatively,
supposing you have things that

00:43:13.603 --> 00:43:16.269
are many thousands of times the
mass of a star,

00:43:16.269 --> 00:43:20.020
but not big enough to totally
disrupt galactic orbits,

00:43:20.020 --> 00:43:24.550
then, there are many fewer of
them for a given amount of mass,

00:43:24.550 --> 00:43:27.490
and there aren't enough MACHO
events that you would have

00:43:27.490 --> 00:43:30.110
expected to see any substantial
number of them.

00:43:30.110 --> 00:43:33.817
So, there's still a way around
the result of these experiments,

00:43:33.817 --> 00:43:35.910
if you want to believe in
MACHOs.

00:43:35.910 --> 00:43:45.260
But it's getting very tough.
So, no WIMPs detected so far.

00:43:45.260 --> 00:43:46.460
No MACHOs.

00:43:49.849 --> 00:43:53.689
You could still postulate kinds
of WIMPs and kinds of MACHOs

00:43:53.689 --> 00:43:57.529
that might explain the dark
matter, but it's getting kind of

00:43:57.529 --> 00:43:59.281
tough.
Most people,

00:43:59.281 --> 00:44:05.034
I think, believe in WIMPs.
Most people tend to believe in

00:44:05.034 --> 00:44:07.882
this.
But, and as far as I can tell,

00:44:07.882 --> 00:44:12.047
that's because the particle
physicists keep coming up with

00:44:12.047 --> 00:44:14.969
new candidate WIMPs that might
exist,

00:44:14.969 --> 00:44:17.909
but that we haven't quite been
able to see, so far.

00:44:17.909 --> 00:44:22.725
And so, there's a theoretical
basis for the existence of these

00:44:22.725 --> 00:44:25.408
things, whereas,
with these MACHOs,

00:44:25.408 --> 00:44:29.039
if you ask the astronomers –
well, fine.

00:44:29.039 --> 00:44:33.052
So, you want to have 90% of the
Universe be in little Earth-like

00:44:33.052 --> 00:44:37.000
things just floating around with
no star, how did they--how did

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:39.369
that happen?
How did these come into being?

00:44:39.369 --> 00:44:41.789
We really have no answer at all
for that.

00:44:41.789 --> 00:44:45.325
So, there's no theoretical
basis for any of the

00:44:45.325 --> 00:44:48.170
still-allowed categories of
MACHOs.

00:44:48.170 --> 00:44:51.192
And so, at the moment,
people tend to believe WIMPs

00:44:51.192 --> 00:44:54.940
over MACHOs, although there's no
direct evidence for either.

00:44:54.940 --> 00:44:57.316
Yes?
Student: If 90% of the

00:44:57.316 --> 00:45:00.604
matter of the Universe is made
of little Earth-like objects,

00:45:00.604 --> 00:45:04.059
then wouldn't that be 90% of
the Universe is made of metal?

00:45:04.059 --> 00:45:05.647
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Oh,

00:45:05.647 --> 00:45:08.346
Earth.
Earth-mass objects is what I

00:45:08.346 --> 00:45:10.152
meant.
I don't care what it's made out

00:45:10.152 --> 00:45:12.322
of.
Yeah, maybe there are little

00:45:12.322 --> 00:45:16.080
Earth-sized balls of hydrogen.
That would be fine too.

00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:20.163
Except how do you get them?
We know something about how

00:45:20.163 --> 00:45:23.670
balls of hydrogen form and what
they become.

00:45:23.670 --> 00:45:26.739
They turn into stars.
This is well known.

00:45:26.739 --> 00:45:30.756
And one of the popular kinds of
MACHOs was just very,

00:45:30.756 --> 00:45:33.503
very dim stars.
And this is one of the things

00:45:33.503 --> 00:45:36.567
that the space telescope helped
to rule out, because it can see

00:45:36.567 --> 00:45:38.940
really faint objects,
and they weren't there.

00:45:38.940 --> 00:45:43.230
And so, no WIMPs.
No MACHOs.

00:45:43.230 --> 00:45:48.710
And so, we don't know what's
going on.

00:45:48.710 --> 00:45:55.308
That was a digression.
And what I digressed from was

00:45:55.308 --> 00:46:02.361
the fact that this galaxy that
we had measured the mass of

00:46:02.361 --> 00:46:07.930
turned out to be 2 x 10^(11)
solar masses,

00:46:07.930 --> 00:46:16.472
or around 4 x 10^(41) kilograms.
If you have these things,

00:46:16.472 --> 00:46:24.395
one such galaxy every--I don't
know, 2 Mpc, or so,

00:46:24.395 --> 00:46:30.539
what's the density of the
Universe?

00:46:30.539 --> 00:46:34.090
Remember, that's where we
started--of the Universe.

00:46:34.090 --> 00:46:36.719
So, now, let's finish this
calculation.

00:46:36.719 --> 00:46:41.750
Let's see the density is equal
to M/V.

00:46:41.750 --> 00:46:47.019
4 x 10^(41),
from observing these orbits.

00:46:47.019 --> 00:46:51.269
And the volume,
down here, is going to 2 Mpc

00:46:51.269 --> 00:46:54.997
cubed.
That's 2 x 10^(6),

00:46:54.997 --> 00:47:00.710
times 2--sorry,
times 3 x 10^(16).

00:47:00.710 --> 00:47:06.680
That's 1 parsec.
So, this is 6 x 10^(22).

00:47:06.680 --> 00:47:09.670
I want to cube it.
6^(3).

00:47:09.670 --> 00:47:14.780
6 x 6 = 36, times another 6,
is 200.

00:47:14.780 --> 00:47:23.210
So, that's 200 x 10^(66),
or 2 x 10^(68).

00:47:23.210 --> 00:47:25.599
So, then, the density of the
Universe.

00:47:25.599 --> 00:47:35.446
(4 x 10^(41)) / (2 x 10^(68)),
that's equal to 2 x 10^(-27)

00:47:35.446 --> 00:47:43.097
kilograms per meter cubed.
And real critical can be

00:47:43.097 --> 00:47:49.497
calculated--turns out to be,
as you'll discover on the

00:47:49.497 --> 00:47:54.809
problem set, 6 x 10^(-27) in
these units.

00:47:54.809 --> 00:48:00.110
ρ over ρ_critical
is equal to about 1/3.

00:48:00.110 --> 00:48:04.478
So, if you buy that,
the Universe is going to keep

00:48:04.478 --> 00:48:09.203
expanding, because Ω,
the ratio of the density to the

00:48:09.203 --> 00:48:12.679
critical density is only about
1/3.

00:48:12.679 --> 00:48:15.370
But the problem is,
we've got all this dark matter

00:48:15.370 --> 00:48:18.610
around and what we're doing is,
we're adding up galaxies.

00:48:18.610 --> 00:48:21.501
How do you know that there
isn't a whole bunch of dark

00:48:21.501 --> 00:48:23.519
matter where there aren't
galaxies?

00:48:23.519 --> 00:48:26.003
And where there's nothing to
see orbiting around,

00:48:26.003 --> 00:48:27.969
you have no idea what this
stuff is.

00:48:27.969 --> 00:48:30.213
And, indeed,
most of the WIMP kinds of

00:48:30.213 --> 00:48:32.759
ideas, sort of,
postulate some kind of dark

00:48:32.759 --> 00:48:35.670
matter that, kind of,
pervades the Universe.

00:48:35.670 --> 00:48:38.783
And so, you'd expect there to
be somewhat more of it than you

00:48:38.783 --> 00:48:42.531
can see in any given galaxy.
Well, somewhat more than 1/3

00:48:42.531 --> 00:48:45.269
gets you into dangerous
territory;

00:48:45.269 --> 00:48:48.043
namely near one,
which is the thing we're trying

00:48:48.043 --> 00:48:51.760
to distinguish--whether this
number is greater than 1 or not.

00:48:51.760 --> 00:48:55.631
And so, you need a new approach.
This isn't going to get you the

00:48:55.631 --> 00:48:57.993
answer.
And so, there is a different

00:48:57.993 --> 00:49:01.201
approach.
And that's what we'll talk

00:49:01.201 --> 00:49:05.156
about next time.
And that will finally bring us

00:49:05.156 --> 00:49:08.154
up to Frontiers and
Controversies in the

00:49:08.154 --> 00:49:09.620
twenty-first century.

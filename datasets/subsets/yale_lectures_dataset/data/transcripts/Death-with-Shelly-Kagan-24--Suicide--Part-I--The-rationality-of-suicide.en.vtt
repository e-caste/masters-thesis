00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:04.643
Professor Shelly Kagan:
Last time, we talked about how

00:00:04.643 --> 00:00:07.446
you should live your life,
in light of the fact of

00:00:07.446 --> 00:00:10.533
our--your mortality.
How does the fact that we will

00:00:10.533 --> 00:00:13.390
die--how should that affect the
way that we live?

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:16.801
What we're going to turn to
now, our final topic for the

00:00:16.801 --> 00:00:19.985
semester, is the flip side.
The fact of our mortality

00:00:19.985 --> 00:00:23.087
raises the question as to
whether or not we should put an

00:00:23.087 --> 00:00:24.987
end to our life.
Strictly speaking,

00:00:24.987 --> 00:00:27.105
I suppose it's not the fact
that we're mortal,

00:00:27.105 --> 00:00:29.836
per se, it's one of those extra
features of death that I've

00:00:29.836 --> 00:00:33.680
discussed previously,
the variability of death.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.145
And more particularly still,
the fact that we can control

00:00:38.145 --> 00:00:41.786
how long we live.
We face the possibility of

00:00:41.786 --> 00:00:46.120
ending our life earlier than it
would end otherwise.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.667
That's suicide, of course.
And so our final topic is,

00:00:49.667 --> 00:00:53.584
under what circumstances,
if any, does suicide make

00:00:53.584 --> 00:00:55.618
sense?
Under what circumstances,

00:00:55.618 --> 00:00:57.850
if any, is it an appropriate
thing to do?

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.475
Now, it's a fairly widespread
feature of our culture that

00:01:02.475 --> 00:01:07.099
suicide is looked upon with such
a mixture of disdain,

00:01:07.099 --> 00:01:11.247
fear, finding it offensive,
that it's very hard,

00:01:11.247 --> 00:01:16.189
often, to think clearly and
discuss the topic clearly.

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:19.202
Most people think it's either
that you've got to be crazy to

00:01:19.202 --> 00:01:21.652
kill yourself.
The very fact that you are

00:01:21.652 --> 00:01:24.980
contemplating suicide is
evidence that you're crazy.

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:27.745
And if you're not crazy,
then it shows that you're

00:01:27.745 --> 00:01:30.527
immoral.
Suicide is clearly never,

00:01:30.527 --> 00:01:33.720
never right,
the right thing to do.

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.381
So, what I want to propose is
that we take some time and look

00:01:37.381 --> 00:01:40.860
at the questions on both sides
with a fair bit of care.

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.138
And the very first thing to do,
I think, in thinking about the

00:01:44.138 --> 00:01:47.872
topic of suicide,
is to distinguish questions of

00:01:47.872 --> 00:01:51.489
rationality from questions of
morality.

00:01:51.489 --> 00:01:53.900
That is, I want us to take a
look at, initially,

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.849
the question,
under what circumstances,

00:01:55.849 --> 00:01:58.670
if ever, would suicide be the
rational thing to do?

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.663
And then later turn to the
question, when,

00:02:01.663 --> 00:02:05.898
if ever, would suicide be a
morally legitimate or a morally

00:02:05.898 --> 00:02:09.550
permissible or morally
acceptable thing to do?

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.800
In posing this distinction,
I'm obviously presupposing that

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.051
these questions can come apart,
or at least they need to be

00:02:18.051 --> 00:02:21.363
examined separately.
Questions of rationality on the

00:02:21.363 --> 00:02:23.870
one hand, and questions of
morality on the other.

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.700
These are both questions about
oughts, as we might put it.

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.846
They're evaluative questions.
But at least most people are

00:02:30.846 --> 00:02:33.901
inclined to think that we are
drawing on different evaluative

00:02:33.901 --> 00:02:36.550
standards when we raise the one
set of questions,

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.500
as opposed to when we raise the
other.

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.933
In many cases,
no doubt, rationality and

00:02:41.933 --> 00:02:46.362
morality go hand in hand.
And there are philosophical

00:02:46.362 --> 00:02:50.468
views about the nature of
rationality and the nature of

00:02:50.468 --> 00:02:55.030
morality, according to which
they always go hand in hand.

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.419
But many of us are inclined to
think that they can come apart.

00:02:57.419 --> 00:02:59.763
Take, for example,
given the season of the year

00:02:59.763 --> 00:03:02.310
that it is, consider doing your
income taxes or,

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.860
more particularly still,
cheating on your income taxes.

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.990
The rate at which income tax
forms get audited is very,

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:14.346
very slight.
And so--and the fines tend to

00:03:14.346 --> 00:03:18.259
not be especially egregious,
even if you do get caught.

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:22.157
So that from a rational point
of view, many of us might think

00:03:22.157 --> 00:03:25.080
it might well be a
rational decision to

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.930
cheat.
You're not likely to get caught.

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:32.000
Even if you do get caught,
how bad's the fine anyway?

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.493
But even if we were to agree
that it was rational to cheat,

00:03:35.493 --> 00:03:38.624
most of us would then
immediately want to follow that

00:03:38.624 --> 00:03:42.178
remark up by pointing out that
doesn't at all mean that it's

00:03:42.178 --> 00:03:45.370
morally acceptable to cheat on
your income tax.

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.175
There's a case perhaps where
you're morally required to do

00:03:49.175 --> 00:03:52.780
something that you're not
rationally required to do.

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.479
Or, take a choice from the
other point of view.

00:03:55.479 --> 00:04:00.402
There you are,
trying to decide between--there

00:04:00.402 --> 00:04:06.527
you are, trying to decide
between your various choices of

00:04:06.527 --> 00:04:10.178
college.
And you've gotten into Yale on

00:04:10.178 --> 00:04:13.608
the one hand,
and perhaps some crummy school,

00:04:13.608 --> 00:04:17.350
your second-rate backup school,
on the other.

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:21.629
And you're trying to decide
what to do there.

00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:25.447
Well, you might think to
yourself, morally I have no

00:04:25.447 --> 00:04:27.937
obligations here.
There's no particular

00:04:27.937 --> 00:04:30.783
obligation, moral requirement,
to go to the better school

00:04:30.783 --> 00:04:33.233
rather than the worse school.
But for all that,

00:04:33.233 --> 00:04:35.365
it would be irrational
of me, perhaps,

00:04:35.365 --> 00:04:38.159
to go to the worse school.
So there's a case where there's

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:40.087
no moral requirement,
but there's a rational

00:04:40.087 --> 00:04:42.227
requirement.
Again, we could debate the

00:04:42.227 --> 00:04:45.388
details of the two examples,
but the point's just to show

00:04:45.388 --> 00:04:47.011
that,
in principle at least,

00:04:47.011 --> 00:04:49.460
on the face of it,
these two questions can come

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.362
apart.
Sometimes it's rationally

00:04:51.362 --> 00:04:53.980
acceptable to do something,
but it's immoral.

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:56.395
Sometimes it's morally
acceptable to do something,

00:04:56.395 --> 00:04:59.312
but it's irrational.
So in thinking about suicide,

00:04:59.312 --> 00:05:02.850
we need to pose the two
questions, one after the other.

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:05.239
So, let's start with the
question about the

00:05:05.239 --> 00:05:09.043
rationality of suicide.
When, if ever,

00:05:09.043 --> 00:05:14.709
is suicide a rational decision
to make?

00:05:14.709 --> 00:05:17.551
Now, once again,
the first thing I want to do in

00:05:17.551 --> 00:05:21.300
thinking about the rationality
of suicide is to distinguish two

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.399
different issues,
or two different questions.

00:05:24.399 --> 00:05:26.389
The first question is going to
be this.

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:31.867
When, if ever,
would it be true that you are

00:05:31.867 --> 00:05:36.399
better off dead?
Could it be the case that your

00:05:36.399 --> 00:05:40.430
life is going so badly that
you'd be better off dead?

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:43.268
Second question,
assuming that the answer to the

00:05:43.268 --> 00:05:45.502
first question is,
under such and such

00:05:45.502 --> 00:05:48.679
circumstances,
you would be better off dead,

00:05:48.679 --> 00:05:52.282
we still have to ask,
could it ever be rational for

00:05:52.282 --> 00:05:56.029
you to trust your
judgment that this is one of

00:05:56.029 --> 00:05:59.560
those cases in which you're
better off dead?

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:04.009
Could it ever be rational for
you to kill yourself?

00:06:04.009 --> 00:06:09.562
Conceivably,
the answer to the second might

00:06:09.562 --> 00:06:11.190
be no.
All right.

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:15.684
So, the question was this.
It's conceivable you might have

00:06:15.684 --> 00:06:19.780
a thought like the following.
In those circumstances in which

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:23.478
life has gotten so horrible that
you'd be better off dead,

00:06:23.478 --> 00:06:27.244
you can't think clearly.
And the very fact that you

00:06:27.244 --> 00:06:31.969
can't think clearly would entail
that you shouldn't trust your

00:06:31.969 --> 00:06:35.610
judgment that you are in one of
those cases.

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:39.027
Whether that's a good argument
or not is something we'll have

00:06:39.027 --> 00:06:41.307
to turn to later.
But it's because of the

00:06:41.307 --> 00:06:44.432
possibility of that argument
that I wanted to distinguish the

00:06:44.432 --> 00:06:46.776
initial question,
could it be true that you're

00:06:46.776 --> 00:06:49.396
better off dead?
from the secondary question,

00:06:49.396 --> 00:06:52.339
even if it could be true that
you're better off dead,

00:06:52.339 --> 00:06:56.121
could it ever be a reasonable
or rational decision for you to

00:06:56.121 --> 00:06:59.209
believe that you're in one of
those situations?

00:06:59.209 --> 00:07:02.757
Unless we've got the two things
in place, it doesn't seem likely

00:07:02.757 --> 00:07:05.910
that it's ever going to be
rational to commit suicide.

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:09.364
So, the very first topic we
have to look at is,

00:07:09.364 --> 00:07:13.420
could it ever be true that
you'd be better off dead?

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:17.263
And immediately,
there's a kind of logical worry

00:07:17.263 --> 00:07:22.005
that may occur to some of you,
certainly has been raised by

00:07:22.005 --> 00:07:27.001
various philosophers.
And that's to say that the very

00:07:27.001 --> 00:07:32.238
judgment, the very claim,
that Jones would be better off

00:07:32.238 --> 00:07:37.039
dead can't make any sense.
On the assumption that,

00:07:37.039 --> 00:07:41.117
look, in order to make
comparisons--better off,

00:07:41.117 --> 00:07:43.328
worse off;
here he is in such and such a

00:07:43.328 --> 00:07:45.208
situation;
he'd be better off in that

00:07:45.208 --> 00:07:48.279
other situation--you've got to
be able to talk about,

00:07:48.279 --> 00:07:51.807
on the one hand,
what condition or state the

00:07:51.807 --> 00:07:56.811
person is before and what
condition or state the person

00:07:56.811 --> 00:08:00.903
would be in afterwards,
if they were to make that

00:08:00.903 --> 00:08:03.453
choice.
Call this the two-state

00:08:03.453 --> 00:08:05.996
requirement.
Normally, when we make

00:08:05.996 --> 00:08:09.337
judgments about whether
something would leave you better

00:08:09.337 --> 00:08:11.827
off or worse off,
we satisfy the two-state

00:08:11.827 --> 00:08:15.387
requirement.
You're trying to decide whether

00:08:15.387 --> 00:08:18.615
or not to lose some weight.
And you think,

00:08:18.615 --> 00:08:22.259
well, here's how well off I am
now, being overweight.

00:08:22.259 --> 00:08:26.068
Here's how well off I would be
later, if I were to lose that

00:08:26.068 --> 00:08:28.429
weight.
I can compare the two states,

00:08:28.429 --> 00:08:31.620
say the second state's better
than the first state.

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:36.720
That's what makes it true that
I'd be better off.

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:41.601
Trying to decide whether or not
to marry the person or break up

00:08:41.601 --> 00:08:46.009
with the person or pick this
career or change careers.

00:08:46.009 --> 00:08:49.939
You've got the state you're in
and you compare it to the state

00:08:49.939 --> 00:08:52.950
you would be in.
You compare the two states.

00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:57.051
That's what allows us to say,
"Yeah, I'd be better off" or

00:08:57.051 --> 00:09:01.205
"No, I'd be worse off."
But when we're talking about

00:09:01.205 --> 00:09:03.645
cases of suicide,
cases where,

00:09:03.645 --> 00:09:08.249
well, here I am now,
the before state

00:09:08.249 --> 00:09:14.169
requirement's in place,
but if we contrast that with

00:09:14.169 --> 00:09:18.580
the after state
requirement,

00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:20.769
well, that part's not met,
right?

00:09:20.769 --> 00:09:24.821
When you--On the assumption
that death is the end,

00:09:24.821 --> 00:09:28.210
that you won't exist,
nonexistence isn't a

00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:31.269
state that you will be
in.

00:09:31.269 --> 00:09:35.583
It's not a condition of
you, because states and

00:09:35.583 --> 00:09:39.560
conditions presuppose existence.
We can talk about are you happy?

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:41.470
Are you sad?
Are you bored?

00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:44.353
Are you excited?
All of those things presuppose

00:09:44.353 --> 00:09:46.840
your existence.
Even are you sleeping?

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:51.100
is a state or condition you can
be in, because you exist.

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:54.399
But if I kill myself,
I won't exist.

00:09:54.399 --> 00:09:59.379
There is no second state to
compare.

00:09:59.379 --> 00:10:02.683
So, how could we possibly say,
the objection goes,

00:10:02.683 --> 00:10:06.460
how could we possibly say that
I'd be better off dead?

00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:09.461
That seems to presuppose that
there's a second state that we

00:10:09.461 --> 00:10:12.723
can compare to my actual state.
Since there isn't one,

00:10:12.723 --> 00:10:15.314
the judgment,
I'd be better off dead,

00:10:15.314 --> 00:10:21.385
can't even get off the ground.
It's got a logical mistake

00:10:21.385 --> 00:10:26.409
built right into it.
Well, that's the objection.

00:10:26.409 --> 00:10:27.774
And, as I say,
there are a number of

00:10:27.774 --> 00:10:29.139
philosophers who are drawn to
it.

00:10:29.139 --> 00:10:30.690
Maybe some of you are drawn to
it as well.

00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:33.820
It seems to me that it's
mistaken.

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:37.665
Consider what we wanted to say
when we talked about the

00:10:37.665 --> 00:10:41.155
deprivation account,
the central account of what's

00:10:41.155 --> 00:10:43.959
bad about death.
For most of us,

00:10:43.959 --> 00:10:48.466
dying would be bad,
because it would deprive us of

00:10:48.466 --> 00:10:53.892
the good things in life that we
would get, if only we didn't

00:10:53.892 --> 00:10:56.702
die.
That seemed like a natural

00:10:56.702 --> 00:10:59.880
thing to say.
It seemed like an appropriate

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:02.515
thing to say.
Of course, we might ask,

00:11:02.515 --> 00:11:06.688
if we believe in the two-state
requirement, how could we

00:11:06.688 --> 00:11:09.991
have said that?
After all, given the two-state

00:11:09.991 --> 00:11:13.059
requirement, to say that death
is bad for me,

00:11:13.059 --> 00:11:15.500
I'd be better off staying
alive.

00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:19.115
If we believe in the two-state
requirement, we've got to say,

00:11:19.115 --> 00:11:22.093
Oh, so had I died,
I would have been in some state

00:11:22.093 --> 00:11:25.355
that I could compare to my
current state and say that it's

00:11:25.355 --> 00:11:26.686
worse.
But, of course,

00:11:26.686 --> 00:11:30.271
death isn't a state.
So, the two-state requirement's

00:11:30.271 --> 00:11:32.726
not met.
Well, we might say this should

00:11:32.726 --> 00:11:34.943
give us some pause.
If the two-state

00:11:34.943 --> 00:11:38.829
requirement--It would be one
thing if all that the two-state

00:11:38.829 --> 00:11:41.993
requirement said was,
you know, we can't ever say

00:11:41.993 --> 00:11:44.582
we'd be better off dead.
But it turns out the two-state

00:11:44.582 --> 00:11:46.340
requirement's got more
implications than that.

00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:49.875
It's got the implication that
you can't even say you're better

00:11:49.875 --> 00:11:53.869
off staying alive.
And that's very,

00:11:53.869 --> 00:11:59.300
very hard to believe.
Imagine that you've got some

00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:02.362
happy person,
some incredibly happy person

00:12:02.362 --> 00:12:06.618
with a wonderful life filled
with whatever goods you think

00:12:06.618 --> 00:12:11.248
are worth having in life--love
and accomplishment and knowledge

00:12:11.248 --> 00:12:16.017
and whatever it is.
He's walking across the street

00:12:16.017 --> 00:12:19.600
and he's about to get hit by a
truck.

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:22.840
And so, at some risk to
yourself, you leap into the way,

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:25.549
pushing him out of the way,
saving his life.

00:12:25.549 --> 00:12:29.950
And happily,
you don't get hurt either.

00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:32.971
He looks up,
realizes he was this close from

00:12:32.971 --> 00:12:35.220
death and he says,
"Thank you.

00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:40.428
Thank you for saving my life."
And now what you have to say

00:12:40.428 --> 00:12:43.039
is, "I'm afraid you're rather
confused.

00:12:43.039 --> 00:12:46.759
Because to say ‘thank you'
for my saving your life is to

00:12:46.759 --> 00:12:49.629
presuppose I've benefited you in
some way.

00:12:49.629 --> 00:12:53.118
To presuppose I've benefited
you in some way is to assume

00:12:53.118 --> 00:12:56.980
that you're--it's a good thing
that your life has continued.

00:12:56.980 --> 00:12:58.294
But, you see,
given the two-state

00:12:58.294 --> 00:13:00.635
requirement, we can't say it's a
good thing that your life

00:13:00.635 --> 00:13:02.365
continued,
because the two-state

00:13:02.365 --> 00:13:05.503
requirement says we can only
make that kind of remark when

00:13:05.503 --> 00:13:07.980
there's a before state and an
after state.

00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:09.950
And the after state would have
been nonexistence.

00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:12.064
So, you see,
you're really rather

00:13:12.064 --> 00:13:15.962
philosophically confused in
thinking that I've done you some

00:13:15.962 --> 00:13:18.539
sort of favor by saving your
life."

00:13:18.539 --> 00:13:24.110
I can't take that argument
seriously.

00:13:24.110 --> 00:13:28.741
It seems to me that--and I hope
that none of you would take it

00:13:28.741 --> 00:13:31.488
seriously, either.
Of course,

00:13:31.488 --> 00:13:35.461
you are doing somebody a favor
when you save their life,

00:13:35.461 --> 00:13:40.012
given the assumption that their
life has been and would continue

00:13:40.012 --> 00:13:44.077
to be wonderful.
And what that shows is not that

00:13:44.077 --> 00:13:49.171
so nonexistence really is a kind
of spooky, super thin state or

00:13:49.171 --> 00:13:51.050
condition.
No, of course it isn't.

00:13:51.050 --> 00:13:54.136
Nonexistence is nonexistence.
It's no kind of condition or

00:13:54.136 --> 00:13:58.499
state at all.
What it shows is the two-state

00:13:58.499 --> 00:14:05.070
requirement isn't a genuine
requirement on these sorts of

00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:09.057
evaluations.
We don't have to say that if

00:14:09.057 --> 00:14:14.230
you had died--when you point to
the person whose life you saved,

00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:20.851
we don't have to say that had
you died, you would have been in

00:14:20.851 --> 00:14:26.060
some inferior state.
We simply have to say the life

00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:30.762
you would have had,
had I saved you and indeed will

00:14:30.762 --> 00:14:35.840
have, given that I have saved
you, is a great life.

00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:41.570
Since it's good,
to lose it would be bad.

00:14:41.570 --> 00:14:48.542
Since losing it would be bad,
saving it for you is benefiting

00:14:48.542 --> 00:14:53.340
you.
It's doing you a favor.

00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:55.500
Two-state requirement says
otherwise.

00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:57.879
Two-state requirement's got to
go.

00:14:57.879 --> 00:15:01.568
But, having gotten rid of it,
we can say the same thing in

00:15:01.568 --> 00:15:05.613
principle on the other side.
Imagine there was somebody

00:15:05.613 --> 00:15:09.981
whose life was horrible,
full of pain and suffering and

00:15:09.981 --> 00:15:12.059
misery.
Now, whether there could be

00:15:12.059 --> 00:15:14.128
such a person,
again, that's a question we'll

00:15:14.128 --> 00:15:17.778
turn to in a second.
But if there were such a

00:15:17.778 --> 00:15:23.128
person, then we can say,
for their life to continue

00:15:23.128 --> 00:15:27.379
isn't good for them;
it's bad for them.

00:15:27.379 --> 00:15:31.640
Their life is full of misery
and suffering and frustration

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:35.057
and disappointment.
And the more and more of that,

00:15:35.057 --> 00:15:37.090
the worse and worse the life
is.

00:15:37.090 --> 00:15:41.874
To lead a life of 100 years,
where every moment is torture

00:15:41.874 --> 00:15:46.995
and pain, is worse than a life
of 30 years, where every moment

00:15:46.995 --> 00:15:51.709
is torture and pain.
So, if you had such a person,

00:15:51.709 --> 00:15:55.620
for their life to go longer
would be bad.

00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:58.972
In which case,
for their life to be going

00:15:58.972 --> 00:16:01.990
shorter, would be better for
them.

00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:06.210
And that's all we mean when we
say they'd be better off dead.

00:16:06.210 --> 00:16:11.437
Not that there's some spooky
super thin and hard to describe

00:16:11.437 --> 00:16:15.690
condition that they'd be in if
they were dead.

00:16:15.690 --> 00:16:19.854
But simply, we look back at the
two possible lives they could

00:16:19.854 --> 00:16:22.139
have.
Just with the person whose life

00:16:22.139 --> 00:16:23.906
we saved.
The first person,

00:16:23.906 --> 00:16:28.233
we compare the great life that
lasts 100 years versus the great

00:16:28.233 --> 00:16:32.282
life that only lasts 20 years
because you didn't save their

00:16:32.282 --> 00:16:35.076
life.
We say, oh, the life of 100

00:16:35.076 --> 00:16:39.394
years, better life.
And so, saving their life is a

00:16:39.394 --> 00:16:43.162
good thing for them.
Similarly, we compare the lives

00:16:43.162 --> 00:16:46.590
of misery, the long life versus
the short life of misery.

00:16:46.590 --> 00:16:49.705
And we say, oh,
the long life of misery is a

00:16:49.705 --> 00:16:53.399
worse life to have than the
short life of misery.

00:16:53.399 --> 00:16:57.091
And that being the case,
we simply can say you'd be

00:16:57.091 --> 00:16:59.850
better off dead.
Not that you'd be in some

00:16:59.850 --> 00:17:02.439
condition that's a good one.
It's simply,

00:17:02.439 --> 00:17:06.700
you'd avoid this
condition, which is a bad one.

00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:09.243
And if the two-state
requirement says otherwise,

00:17:09.243 --> 00:17:11.950
so much the worse for the two
state requirement.

00:17:11.950 --> 00:17:13.878
All right.
So this is by way of the

00:17:13.878 --> 00:17:16.373
logical worry,
that we can't even get off the

00:17:16.373 --> 00:17:19.719
ground in talking about the
possibility that you'd be better

00:17:19.719 --> 00:17:22.309
off dead.
I think if we believe in the

00:17:22.309 --> 00:17:25.539
two-state requirement,
maybe we'd have to say that.

00:17:25.539 --> 00:17:29.927
But the cost of accepting the
two-state requirement is so

00:17:29.927 --> 00:17:34.706
implausible, that the person's
dying of a heart attack and you

00:17:34.706 --> 00:17:37.110
perform CPR.
Instead of saying "Thank you,"

00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:38.836
they say, "Oh,
I'm really no better off than I

00:17:38.836 --> 00:17:40.754
would have been if I died,
even though I'm having a

00:17:40.754 --> 00:17:43.027
wonderful life."
The two-state requirement's

00:17:43.027 --> 00:17:45.309
just so implausible,
we should let it go.

00:17:45.309 --> 00:17:49.233
Now, having done that,
of course, doesn't yet tell us

00:17:49.233 --> 00:17:51.119
that it could,
in fact,

00:17:51.119 --> 00:17:55.338
be the case that somebody's
life could be so bad that they'd

00:17:55.338 --> 00:17:59.904
be better off dead,
that the existence that they've

00:17:59.904 --> 00:18:03.759
got is worse than not existing
at all.

00:18:03.759 --> 00:18:06.460
All we've done so far is leave
open the door;

00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:10.178
open the door to the
possibility of saying that

00:18:10.178 --> 00:18:13.160
coherently.
But that doesn't mean it's true.

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:19.204
Whether or not there could be
such lives depends on your view

00:18:19.204 --> 00:18:24.140
about what's the correct account
of well-being.

00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:29.740
What is it that goes into
making somebody's life

00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:33.385
worthwhile?
Now, as we've seen previously,

00:18:33.385 --> 00:18:38.069
this is a controversial topic.
People disagree about the

00:18:38.069 --> 00:18:41.900
ingredients of the best kind of
life.

00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:46.181
And because of these
differences, we're going to get

00:18:46.181 --> 00:18:51.051
philosophical differences of
opinion with regard to whether

00:18:51.051 --> 00:18:56.005
or not a life could be so bad
that it would be better for it

00:18:56.005 --> 00:18:59.233
to come to an end.
I'm not going to try to

00:18:59.233 --> 00:19:01.660
rehearse all the possible
theories there are.

00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:03.452
Or, for that matter,
even all the theories that

00:19:03.452 --> 00:19:06.951
we've talked about previously.
But to give you an illustration

00:19:06.951 --> 00:19:10.366
of how it could be true,
imagine, go back to our

00:19:10.366 --> 00:19:13.490
simplest theory of
well-being--hedonism,

00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:18.319
according to which your quality
of life is a matter of adding up

00:19:18.319 --> 00:19:22.000
all the pleasure and subtracting
all the pain.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.994
And we need to take into
account how long the pleasures

00:19:24.994 --> 00:19:28.043
and the pains last and how
intense the pleasures and the

00:19:28.043 --> 00:19:30.630
pains are.
But still, we add up the total

00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:33.347
amount of pleasure,
add up the total amount of

00:19:33.347 --> 00:19:35.824
pain,
subtract the pain from the

00:19:35.824 --> 00:19:39.660
pleasure and look to see what
our grand total is.

00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:41.450
If it's positive,
your life's worth living.

00:19:41.450 --> 00:19:44.749
And the greater the number,
the greater the positive

00:19:44.749 --> 00:19:47.660
number, the more your life is
worth living.

00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:51.885
If it's negative though,
if your life is filled with

00:19:51.885 --> 00:19:55.779
pain and suffering,
or at least so much pain and

00:19:55.779 --> 00:20:00.585
suffering that it outweighs
whatever pleasures you may have

00:20:00.585 --> 00:20:04.160
in your life,
so that your balance is a

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:07.279
negative one,
then your life's not worth

00:20:07.279 --> 00:20:09.816
living.
Having that go longer and

00:20:09.816 --> 00:20:13.079
longer is just more and more
negative balance.

00:20:13.079 --> 00:20:17.336
That's a life that's bad for
you to have and you'd be better

00:20:17.336 --> 00:20:20.425
off not having it.
You'd be better off having your

00:20:20.425 --> 00:20:25.130
life come to an end.
You'd be better off dead.

00:20:25.130 --> 00:20:29.289
And, of course,
the more and more negative the

00:20:29.289 --> 00:20:33.079
grand total is,
the worse your life is.

00:20:33.079 --> 00:20:36.760
And so the more it's true that
you'd be better off dead.

00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:39.739
Well, that's what hedonism says.
If we're not hedonists,

00:20:39.739 --> 00:20:42.091
and of course,
previously I've argued that we

00:20:42.091 --> 00:20:44.977
shouldn't be hedonists,
then we need a more complicated

00:20:44.977 --> 00:20:47.722
theory of the good.
We need to throw in other

00:20:47.722 --> 00:20:50.119
things, perhaps,
certain external goods.

00:20:50.119 --> 00:20:52.631
It's not just a matter of
getting the insides right--the

00:20:52.631 --> 00:20:55.326
pleasure and the pain and the
other mental states--there are

00:20:55.326 --> 00:20:57.792
various facts about your
objective hookup with the rest

00:20:57.792 --> 00:21:00.087
of the world.
Are you really climbing Mount

00:21:00.087 --> 00:21:02.497
Everest?
Are you really accomplishing

00:21:02.497 --> 00:21:04.562
things?
Do people really love you,

00:21:04.562 --> 00:21:08.582
and so forth and so on?
Whatever your list is of those

00:21:08.582 --> 00:21:13.409
other objective goods--well
you'll probably also want to

00:21:13.409 --> 00:21:18.059
have a list of other objective
bads, besides pain.

00:21:18.059 --> 00:21:21.150
But still, the same basic idea
is going to be in place.

00:21:21.150 --> 00:21:25.634
We're going to want to somehow
add up all of the various

00:21:25.634 --> 00:21:28.732
objective goods,
add up all the various

00:21:28.732 --> 00:21:32.890
objective bads,
and see where the balance lies.

00:21:32.890 --> 00:21:35.853
Do the goods outweigh the bad?
If the goods outweigh the bad,

00:21:35.853 --> 00:21:37.869
that's great.
Your life's worth living.

00:21:37.869 --> 00:21:43.746
But if the bads outweigh the
good, then your life is not

00:21:43.746 --> 00:21:48.019
worth living,
or not worth continuing.

00:21:48.019 --> 00:21:51.658
Now, as we've noted before,
there are philosophical

00:21:51.658 --> 00:21:54.859
theories which go on to
claim--pessimists,

00:21:54.859 --> 00:21:58.316
various versions of pessimistic
views, which say,

00:21:58.316 --> 00:22:00.980
for everybody in all
circumstances,

00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:06.059
life is so bad that they'd be
better off dead.

00:22:06.059 --> 00:22:08.690
Life's so full of suffering and
misery, that whatever pleasures

00:22:08.690 --> 00:22:10.940
there are and other goods there
may be in the life,

00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:14.369
they get outweighed by the
objective bads.

00:22:14.369 --> 00:22:19.290
There are philosophical views
like that, but I suppose the

00:22:19.290 --> 00:22:23.213
commonsense view is,
well, even if some lives may be

00:22:23.213 --> 00:22:27.392
so bad that the person is better
off dead, that's not true of all

00:22:27.392 --> 00:22:31.913
lives.
It depends on the facts of the

00:22:31.913 --> 00:22:35.121
case.
So, let's focus on that

00:22:35.121 --> 00:22:37.537
possibility.
Of course, even here,

00:22:37.537 --> 00:22:40.032
we still have to return to
another issue that we've

00:22:40.032 --> 00:22:46.112
considered before.
Namely, is life itself worth

00:22:46.112 --> 00:22:50.176
having?
Is the very fact that you're

00:22:50.176 --> 00:22:53.868
alive itself a good thing?
These are the valuable

00:22:53.868 --> 00:22:55.976
container theories,
which I've previously

00:22:55.976 --> 00:22:58.609
contrasted with the neutral
container theories.

00:22:58.609 --> 00:23:02.356
You'll recall that according to
the neutral container theories,

00:23:02.356 --> 00:23:05.195
in thinking about the quality
of someone's life,

00:23:05.195 --> 00:23:08.734
you just look at the contents.
Life itself is only a

00:23:08.734 --> 00:23:12.412
container, good or bad,
depending on what it's filled

00:23:12.412 --> 00:23:15.202
up with.
But opposed to the neutral

00:23:15.202 --> 00:23:18.607
container theories,
we had valuable container

00:23:18.607 --> 00:23:23.172
theories which say the very fact
that you're alive adds some

00:23:23.172 --> 00:23:27.661
positive value above and beyond
whatever's going on in your

00:23:27.661 --> 00:23:29.750
life.
Now, even the valuable

00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:32.230
container theories came in
different versions.

00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:35.811
There were more modest
versions, where in principle,

00:23:35.811 --> 00:23:39.953
the positive value of being
alive could be outweighed if the

00:23:39.953 --> 00:23:43.643
contents got bad enough.
And we contrast that with

00:23:43.643 --> 00:23:47.709
fantastic container theories,
according to which being alive

00:23:47.709 --> 00:23:50.930
is so valuable,
that it doesn't matter how bad

00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:53.834
the contents get,
the grand total is always a

00:23:53.834 --> 00:23:57.286
positive one.
Now look, if you accept a

00:23:57.286 --> 00:24:01.790
fantastic container theory,
then pretty clearly,

00:24:01.790 --> 00:24:07.349
it's never true that somebody
could be better off dead.

00:24:07.349 --> 00:24:11.334
Because no matter how bad the
contents get,

00:24:11.334 --> 00:24:14.940
the fact that they're alive,
per se,

00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:19.385
is so valuable,
it outweighs that subtotal,

00:24:19.385 --> 00:24:23.089
giving us a positive grand
total.

00:24:23.089 --> 00:24:26.606
So pretty clearly,
from the perspective of

00:24:26.606 --> 00:24:32.009
fantastic container theories,
suicide will never be rational,

00:24:32.009 --> 00:24:35.080
because it's never true that
you're better off dead,

00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:38.089
because it's never true that
your life over all,

00:24:38.089 --> 00:24:42.025
taking everything that's
relevant into consideration,

00:24:42.025 --> 00:24:44.809
gives us a negative.
Yeah, question.

00:24:44.809 --> 00:24:52.017
Student: [inaudible]
Professor Shelly Kagan:

00:24:52.017 --> 00:24:56.216
The question was,
on the fantastic container

00:24:56.216 --> 00:24:59.670
theories, what's so incredible
about life itself?

00:24:59.670 --> 00:25:01.660
Are we saying it's
intrinsically valuable?

00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:03.930
And yes, the answer is:
precisely.

00:25:03.930 --> 00:25:08.256
The fans of the valuable
container theories are saying

00:25:08.256 --> 00:25:11.834
being alive itself is valuable.
You may recall that I

00:25:11.834 --> 00:25:13.730
previously said although people
talk that way,

00:25:13.730 --> 00:25:15.710
they probably don't actually
mean it, right?

00:25:15.710 --> 00:25:17.621
If you told them,
okay, you can be alive as a

00:25:17.621 --> 00:25:19.055
blade of grass,
they wouldn't say,

00:25:19.055 --> 00:25:20.620
"Oh, wouldn't that be
wonderful?

00:25:20.620 --> 00:25:23.691
That's worth having."
Most fans of the claim that

00:25:23.691 --> 00:25:26.706
being alive, per se,
is valuable don't really mean

00:25:26.706 --> 00:25:31.811
life per se.
They mean something more like

00:25:31.811 --> 00:25:36.507
life as a person.
Being the kind of entity who

00:25:36.507 --> 00:25:40.650
can think and plan,
even if your plans go wrong,

00:25:40.650 --> 00:25:45.427
at least you were a person able
to experience things,

00:25:45.427 --> 00:25:48.000
know things,
and so forth.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:52.752
Of course, if that's the reason
for accepting the fantastic

00:25:52.752 --> 00:25:56.180
container theory,
then we might wonder what

00:25:56.180 --> 00:26:00.521
should we say about those cases
where the P-functioning has

00:26:00.521 --> 00:26:04.711
decayed and the person is no
longer able to continue as a

00:26:04.711 --> 00:26:09.029
person,
but perhaps can still feel pain?

00:26:09.029 --> 00:26:11.215
In that case,
perhaps, life could cease to be

00:26:11.215 --> 00:26:13.478
worth living.
Though whether or not we should

00:26:13.478 --> 00:26:16.222
describe it in that way also
depends on these complicated

00:26:16.222 --> 00:26:18.280
issues that we've discussed
previously,

00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:20.980
about would that still be you?
Would you still exist?

00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:23.470
Would you still be alive under
those circumstances?

00:26:23.470 --> 00:26:27.319
So, the basic idea behind
valuable container theories is

00:26:27.319 --> 00:26:29.910
that life, or the life of a
person,

00:26:29.910 --> 00:26:32.713
or something like that,
has intrinsic value above and

00:26:32.713 --> 00:26:35.840
beyond the question of what's
going on within your life.

00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:43.416
If we accept the fantastic
container theory,

00:26:43.416 --> 00:26:47.970
maybe nobody's life is ever so
bad, grand total.

00:26:47.970 --> 00:26:50.953
Because--so that suicide would
be the rational thing to

00:26:50.953 --> 00:26:54.212
do--because the value of life,
per se, is so incredible that

00:26:54.212 --> 00:26:57.037
it outweighs the contents.
It has to outweigh the

00:26:57.037 --> 00:26:59.380
contents.
That's a philosophical view at

00:26:59.380 --> 00:27:01.710
the opposite end of the
pessimists.

00:27:01.710 --> 00:27:04.553
The pessimist said,
"As a matter of philosophical

00:27:04.553 --> 00:27:07.929
reflection, we can see that
everybody's life is worse than

00:27:07.929 --> 00:27:10.582
nothing."
The fantastic container fans

00:27:10.582 --> 00:27:14.077
are saying, "As a matter of
philosophical reflection,

00:27:14.077 --> 00:27:18.109
we can see that everybody's
life is better than nothing."

00:27:18.109 --> 00:27:21.066
Most of us, I imagine,
find ourselves somewhere in

00:27:21.066 --> 00:27:23.026
between.
Either we believe in the

00:27:23.026 --> 00:27:26.304
neutral container theory and
think it's a contingent matter

00:27:26.304 --> 00:27:29.299
whether the contents are
sufficiently good or bad.

00:27:29.299 --> 00:27:33.394
Or, we may accept the modest
version of the valuable

00:27:33.394 --> 00:27:36.040
container theory.
On that theory,

00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:39.027
of course, life has some
intrinsic value,

00:27:39.027 --> 00:27:42.089
but it's got a finite intrinsic
value.

00:27:42.089 --> 00:27:44.712
And in principle,
even that could be

00:27:44.712 --> 00:27:47.460
outweighed if the contents get
bad enough.

00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:49.294
And so again,
it would be an empirical

00:27:49.294 --> 00:27:52.955
question.
We have to take a look and see,

00:27:52.955 --> 00:27:57.680
in which cases do the contents
get bad enough?

00:27:57.680 --> 00:28:01.740
Now, I guess I'm one of these
people in the middle.

00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:04.911
I'm inclined to think it's not
true that everybody's life is

00:28:04.911 --> 00:28:07.703
worse than nothing.
Nor is it true that everybody's

00:28:07.703 --> 00:28:11.980
life is better than nothing.
It varies from person to person.

00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:14.311
And indeed, not just--since
we're thinking about suicide,

00:28:14.311 --> 00:28:16.309
we're not talking about their
life as a whole,

00:28:16.309 --> 00:28:21.380
but really, what does life
promise from here on out?

00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:24.054
Sadly enough,
sad to say, it seems to me

00:28:24.054 --> 00:28:27.003
there are cases,
and probably most of us are

00:28:27.003 --> 00:28:30.871
familiar with cases,
where the correct description,

00:28:30.871 --> 00:28:35.314
given the--your favorite theory
of well-being--is going to be

00:28:35.314 --> 00:28:38.691
that for this person,
here on out,

00:28:38.691 --> 00:28:42.476
what life has to offer is
sufficiently bad,

00:28:42.476 --> 00:28:47.073
so that the contents are
sufficiently negative as to

00:28:47.073 --> 00:28:51.759
outweigh whatever value life
itself might have.

00:28:51.759 --> 00:28:56.866
We could imagine somebody in
the terminal stages of some

00:28:56.866 --> 00:29:02.251
illness, where their cancer
perhaps is causing them a great

00:29:02.251 --> 00:29:05.526
deal of pain.
And the pain is so bad that

00:29:05.526 --> 00:29:08.289
they can't really do much of
anything else.

00:29:08.289 --> 00:29:11.968
It's not as though they could
continue working on their novel

00:29:11.968 --> 00:29:15.339
or continue talking with the
members of their family,

00:29:15.339 --> 00:29:19.513
because they're just distracted
by the pain and wishing it would

00:29:19.513 --> 00:29:21.988
come to an end.
Horribly enough,

00:29:21.988 --> 00:29:26.707
many degenerative diseases
leave the person less and less

00:29:26.707 --> 00:29:31.089
capable of doing the things that
give life value.

00:29:31.089 --> 00:29:35.218
And the very realization that
you're in that situation and no

00:29:35.218 --> 00:29:38.039
longer able to spend time doing
things,

00:29:38.039 --> 00:29:40.552
or hanging out with your
family, or talking with them,

00:29:40.552 --> 00:29:44.676
or whatever it is may,
itself, be a source of more

00:29:44.676 --> 00:29:49.365
frustration and pain.
There are medical conditions

00:29:49.365 --> 00:29:53.635
where, horribly enough,
infants get born where they're

00:29:53.635 --> 00:29:58.549
just in continual pain and they
never develop cognitively.

00:29:58.549 --> 00:30:00.569
Their brain doesn't develop and
then they die.

00:30:00.569 --> 00:30:05.211
And you look at these lives and
you say these are lives--I want

00:30:05.211 --> 00:30:09.180
to say, these are lives that
were not worth having.

00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:13.252
These children would have been
better off never having been

00:30:13.252 --> 00:30:17.114
born at all, certainly not any
kind of favor for them to

00:30:17.114 --> 00:30:21.806
continue their lives.
Well, let's focus on some case

00:30:21.806 --> 00:30:25.885
like the terminal patient.
A person's got a disease--at

00:30:25.885 --> 00:30:28.039
least, that would be a nice easy
example.

00:30:28.039 --> 00:30:30.250
Not easy to live through,
but easy philosophically.

00:30:30.250 --> 00:30:32.801
Easy example to think
about--some terminally ill

00:30:32.801 --> 00:30:35.569
patient whose disease is getting
worse and worse.

00:30:35.569 --> 00:30:39.385
And so, there are fewer and
fewer of the good things in life

00:30:39.385 --> 00:30:43.945
that the future holds for them.
Instead, what the future holds

00:30:43.945 --> 00:30:47.503
is more and more pain,
suffering, incapacity,

00:30:47.503 --> 00:30:50.771
and frustration.
When it gets bad enough,

00:30:50.771 --> 00:30:53.729
it seems to me,
in some of those cases the

00:30:53.729 --> 00:30:57.013
person can correctly say,
or we, at least,

00:30:57.013 --> 00:31:01.280
can correctly say of them,
they'd be better off dead.

00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:06.251
All right.
Let me try to draw some

00:31:06.251 --> 00:31:09.183
examples.
Again, we're bracketing the

00:31:09.183 --> 00:31:12.950
question: Can the person think
clearly about their case?

00:31:12.950 --> 00:31:16.752
That'll come later.
Let's just try to talk about

00:31:16.752 --> 00:31:22.230
when would suicide make sense?
When would it be sort of a

00:31:22.230 --> 00:31:26.040
rational thing to do to end your
life?

00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:26.790
A couple of different cases.

00:31:31.530 --> 00:31:32.620
I'm going to draw graphs.

00:31:37.130 --> 00:31:42.400
We'll let the x-axis represent
time.

00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:48.778
And the y-axis represents how
good or bad your life is at that

00:31:48.778 --> 00:31:49.510
time.

00:31:53.569 --> 00:31:57.098
For those of us who are fans of
the neutral container theory,

00:31:57.098 --> 00:32:00.332
the thing to say is this
represents the overall goodness

00:32:00.332 --> 00:32:03.920
of your contents or the overall
badness of your contents.

00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:05.380
The higher up,
the better the contents.

00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:08.329
The lower down,
the worse the contents.

00:32:08.329 --> 00:32:12.415
For those who are fans of the
modest container theory,

00:32:12.415 --> 00:32:15.190
this represents the grand
balance.

00:32:15.190 --> 00:32:20.950
So it's contents plus the extra
bit you get from being alive.

00:32:20.950 --> 00:32:23.022
But of course,
if you're a fan of the modest

00:32:23.022 --> 00:32:25.240
container theory,
then even if the contents are

00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:27.940
negative, the grand balance
might still be positive.

00:32:27.940 --> 00:32:32.545
But this represents the overall
bottom line, whether you accept

00:32:32.545 --> 00:32:37.150
the neutral container theory or
the modest container theory.

00:32:37.150 --> 00:32:41.069
So, here's an example of what a
life might look like.

00:32:41.069 --> 00:32:45.180
It's going along pretty well
and then things get worse.

00:32:45.180 --> 00:32:50.409
And things sort of deteriorate.
And let's suppose this point

00:32:50.409 --> 00:32:54.940
represents when you would die of
natural causes,

00:32:54.940 --> 00:32:57.629
natural death.
So, towards the end,

00:32:57.629 --> 00:33:00.828
life's not as great as it was
when you were young and vigorous

00:33:00.828 --> 00:33:03.398
and healthy and had all sorts of
opportunities and

00:33:03.398 --> 00:33:08.469
accomplishments.
But still, till the very end,

00:33:08.469 --> 00:33:13.577
it stays positive.
Well, if that's what your

00:33:13.577 --> 00:33:17.588
lifeline would look like,
pretty clearly,

00:33:17.588 --> 00:33:21.500
suicide doesn't ever make any
sense.

00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:24.025
In particular,
you wouldn't want to say oh,

00:33:24.025 --> 00:33:26.972
look, here's the place where I
should kill myself,

00:33:26.972 --> 00:33:30.099
because here is where things
start to get worse.

00:33:30.099 --> 00:33:34.963
Yes, things are beginning to
get worse, but they never get so

00:33:34.963 --> 00:33:41.543
bad that you're better off dead.
So, suicide wouldn't make any

00:33:41.543 --> 00:33:45.811
sense at all.
For suicide to make sense,

00:33:45.811 --> 00:33:51.211
it's got to be the case that
your life takes a turn for the

00:33:51.211 --> 00:33:54.732
worse.
Not just any old turn for the

00:33:54.732 --> 00:34:00.190
worse, but a turn so much for
the worse, that for some chunk

00:34:00.190 --> 00:34:03.696
of your life,
your life is worse than

00:34:03.696 --> 00:34:06.076
nonexistence,
the zero line,

00:34:06.076 --> 00:34:08.120
the x-axis.
All right.

00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:11.159
Imagine that's what's happened.
Here you are.

00:34:11.159 --> 00:34:12.627
You're healthy,
you're vigorous,

00:34:12.627 --> 00:34:14.853
you're accomplishing things,
but you've got some

00:34:14.853 --> 00:34:17.551
degenerative disease that's
going to make things worse and

00:34:17.551 --> 00:34:19.218
worse.
Here's the period in which it's

00:34:19.218 --> 00:34:21.501
getting worse.
And then after a while,

00:34:21.501 --> 00:34:25.309
your existence is going to be
worse than nothing.

00:34:25.309 --> 00:34:28.641
Here, we can at least broach
the question in an intelligible

00:34:28.641 --> 00:34:31.900
way.
Might suicide make sense?

00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:36.320
Suppose this is the point where
the downturn begins.

00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:39.540
Should you kill yourself at
that stage?

00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:42.424
No.
Because, after all,

00:34:42.424 --> 00:34:46.590
even though there's a downturn,
things are getting worse,

00:34:46.590 --> 00:34:49.279
there's still going to be
another period of life,

00:34:49.279 --> 00:34:51.519
another chunk of whatever it
is--year,

00:34:51.519 --> 00:34:55.566
five years, six months,
whatever it is--where although

00:34:55.566 --> 00:34:58.850
life isn't as good as it had
been before,

00:34:58.850 --> 00:35:04.886
it's still better than nothing.
Killing yourself at this

00:35:04.886 --> 00:35:07.826
earlier moment is,
we might say,

00:35:07.826 --> 00:35:11.380
premature.
It's throwing away a chunk of

00:35:11.380 --> 00:35:14.500
life that would still be worth
having.

00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:16.980
It's not the right thing to do.
It doesn't make sense

00:35:16.980 --> 00:35:17.540
rationally.

00:35:21.130 --> 00:35:23.120
Well, if not that moment,
what about this moment?

00:35:26.420 --> 00:35:31.488
Here's the precise point at
which your life is becoming

00:35:31.488 --> 00:35:34.730
worse than nothing.
For some initial stretch of

00:35:34.730 --> 00:35:36.989
that, it won't be very much
worse than nothing.

00:35:36.989 --> 00:35:41.090
But still, overall,
it's a negative.

00:35:41.090 --> 00:35:43.969
Up to that moment,
your life was worth living.

00:35:43.969 --> 00:35:47.483
From that moment on,
your life is worse than

00:35:47.483 --> 00:35:50.975
nothing.
If you've got complete control

00:35:50.975 --> 00:35:56.147
over when to kill yourself,
well, that would be the time to

00:35:56.147 --> 00:36:01.018
do it.
Suppose you don't have complete

00:36:01.018 --> 00:36:04.362
control.
It's straightforward enough to

00:36:04.362 --> 00:36:08.471
say if your life is going to
become worse than nothing and

00:36:08.471 --> 00:36:12.579
you have complete control over
when you kill yourself,

00:36:12.579 --> 00:36:16.424
it seems pretty plausible to
say the precise moment at which

00:36:16.424 --> 00:36:20.333
suicide would become rational
would be exactly that moment at

00:36:20.333 --> 00:36:23.199
which your life became not worth
having.

00:36:23.199 --> 00:36:26.120
But you might not have that
kind of control.

00:36:29.130 --> 00:36:34.120
Suppose that what you've got is
a degenerative disease that is

00:36:34.120 --> 00:36:39.193
going to progressively strip you
of the ability to control your

00:36:39.193 --> 00:36:41.920
body.
Still, your mind works for a

00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:45.387
much longer time.
And so, for a period of time,

00:36:45.387 --> 00:36:49.537
you're basically stuck in your
hospital bed being fed by

00:36:49.537 --> 00:36:52.217
somebody else.
But perhaps you're able to

00:36:52.217 --> 00:36:55.710
listen to your family talk about
things, have books read to you.

00:36:55.710 --> 00:36:57.224
Maybe you can engage in
conversation,

00:36:57.224 --> 00:36:59.369
even though you can't use your
arms and so forth.

00:36:59.369 --> 00:37:03.536
Your life's still worth living,
but the time's going to come

00:37:03.536 --> 00:37:06.289
when your life won't be worth
living.

00:37:06.289 --> 00:37:10.226
And at that point,
you'll no longer have the

00:37:10.226 --> 00:37:15.260
ability to kill yourself,
because you won't have control

00:37:15.260 --> 00:37:18.410
over your body.
It raises the question of--I'm

00:37:18.410 --> 00:37:21.136
sure you can all see at this
point, the question of suicide

00:37:21.136 --> 00:37:22.969
also turns into or comes up
against,

00:37:22.969 --> 00:37:26.199
the question about euthanasia,
mercy killing.

00:37:26.199 --> 00:37:29.180
Under what circumstances is it
ever rational to ask somebody

00:37:29.180 --> 00:37:31.899
else to kill you?
Under what circumstances,

00:37:31.899 --> 00:37:35.347
if ever, is it morally
legitimate to kill somebody

00:37:35.347 --> 00:37:38.339
else?
But let's continue to focus on

00:37:38.339 --> 00:37:42.755
the case of suicide.
Suppose you live in a society

00:37:42.755 --> 00:37:48.280
which is so unenlightened as to
have ruled out euthanasia.

00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:50.420
In fact, you live in our
society.

00:37:50.420 --> 00:37:54.825
And so, what we don't allow is
the possibility of somebody else

00:37:54.825 --> 00:37:58.449
coming along and killing you
when the time comes.

00:37:58.449 --> 00:38:03.206
So, you know the time is going
to come at which you'd be better

00:38:03.206 --> 00:38:05.646
off dead.
But once you're there,

00:38:05.646 --> 00:38:08.040
once you're here,
it's too late.

00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:10.582
You can't do it.
You won't have the ability to

00:38:10.582 --> 00:38:12.975
kill yourself,
and nobody else will be able to

00:38:12.975 --> 00:38:15.198
do it for you.
In that case,

00:38:15.198 --> 00:38:20.170
killing yourself earlier might
still make sense.

00:38:20.170 --> 00:38:21.910
Take this earlier point,
for example.

00:38:24.969 --> 00:38:29.372
Here, if you kill yourself now,
you're throwing away some life

00:38:29.372 --> 00:38:33.219
that's worth living.
But if this is the last moment

00:38:33.219 --> 00:38:36.911
at which you're going to be able
to kill yourself,

00:38:36.911 --> 00:38:40.000
it might still make sense,
rationally.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:44.920
Because your choice is not end
it here or end it there.

00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:48.796
We're assuming you don't have
the possibility of ending it

00:38:48.796 --> 00:38:52.673
here, at the precise moment at
which life became no longer

00:38:52.673 --> 00:38:54.721
worth having.
Your choice,

00:38:54.721 --> 00:38:59.812
instead, is really just this.
End it here and throw away this

00:38:59.812 --> 00:39:04.414
whole last bit.
Or not end it and then continue

00:39:04.414 --> 00:39:10.103
until you die from the disease.
So, your question is only,

00:39:10.103 --> 00:39:14.840
what do I think about the value
of this last bit?

00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:17.103
On the whole,
it's got a good part and it's

00:39:17.103 --> 00:39:20.229
god a bad part.
Is it better to have the good

00:39:20.229 --> 00:39:24.190
part and the bad part or better
to have none of it?

00:39:24.190 --> 00:39:26.748
And the answer,
of course, is well,

00:39:26.748 --> 00:39:30.285
if the bad part's going to
continue long enough,

00:39:30.285 --> 00:39:36.380
it's better to have none of it.
The bad outweighs the good.

00:39:36.380 --> 00:39:40.091
So that the rational thing to
do would be to decide to end

00:39:40.091 --> 00:39:42.500
your life then,
when you still can,

00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:47.364
rather than condemn yourself to
the long final stretch of life

00:39:47.364 --> 00:39:48.880
not worth living.

00:39:53.599 --> 00:40:00.361
Well, what if the last time
that you could actually control

00:40:00.361 --> 00:40:06.190
it was way back here,
for whatever reason it is.

00:40:06.190 --> 00:40:09.962
Here, you've got access to the
means of killing yourself and

00:40:09.962 --> 00:40:13.737
you won't have access later.
Your life's still going to be

00:40:13.737 --> 00:40:17.045
great for a very long time.
And then, inevitably,

00:40:17.045 --> 00:40:19.570
it'll be bad for a period of
time.

00:40:19.570 --> 00:40:22.566
But at least if I've drawn it
right, if not,

00:40:22.566 --> 00:40:25.590
we can shorten this.
I suppose death would come here.

00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:34.050
Here's a case where if you
don't kill yourself now,

00:40:34.050 --> 00:40:38.480
you're condemning yourself to
the whole rest of the story.

00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:42.265
But we might say, "All right.
Although, admittedly,

00:40:42.265 --> 00:40:47.028
the end of the story's going to
be negative, the only way to

00:40:47.028 --> 00:40:51.871
avoid that negative last part is
to throw away this very long

00:40:51.871 --> 00:40:56.030
great initial part."
That doesn't make sense.

00:40:56.030 --> 00:41:00.679
Although your life is now still
going to be a mixture of good

00:41:00.679 --> 00:41:04.787
and bad, and you wish there were
a way to end it here,

00:41:04.787 --> 00:41:08.519
you don't have that choice.
It's throw away the good

00:41:08.519 --> 00:41:10.679
and the bad,
or keep them both.

00:41:10.679 --> 00:41:14.235
And in this story,
obviously enough,

00:41:14.235 --> 00:41:18.400
the good is enough to outweigh
the bad.

00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:24.070
So, suicide doesn't make sense
in that situation.

00:41:24.070 --> 00:41:29.100
Here's a rather different way
the story might go.

00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:39.388
Suppose your life's going along
really great and it takes a turn

00:41:39.388 --> 00:41:43.190
for the worse but then is going
to get better.

00:41:43.190 --> 00:41:48.810
So, it ends here with death by
natural causes.

00:41:48.810 --> 00:41:55.152
Could suicide make sense here?
Does it make sense to say,

00:41:55.152 --> 00:41:58.423
"Look, I'm going to kill myself
in order to avoid the downturn"

00:41:58.423 --> 00:42:03.379
or indeed,
even if the recovery wasn't so

00:42:03.379 --> 00:42:10.210
long a recovery,
could suicide make sense here,

00:42:10.210 --> 00:42:13.179
because you're about to take
this big dip down and be

00:42:13.179 --> 00:42:16.663
condemned to most of the rest of
your life being significantly

00:42:16.663 --> 00:42:22.109
worse than it was before?
No, suicide doesn't make sense

00:42:22.109 --> 00:42:26.575
in this situation.
Because even though what you're

00:42:26.575 --> 00:42:30.640
going to have during this period
is a life worse than the life

00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:34.190
you had before,
the life you've got here is

00:42:34.190 --> 00:42:38.809
still above the x-axis.
It's still a life worth living.

00:42:38.809 --> 00:42:41.186
This point, I think,
is probably crucial enough that

00:42:41.186 --> 00:42:43.190
it's worth taking a moment to
reflect on.

00:42:43.190 --> 00:42:47.468
The fact that your life is less
good than it had been,

00:42:47.468 --> 00:42:51.908
less good than indeed maybe all
the lives around you are

00:42:51.908 --> 00:42:56.589
having--all the people around
you are having lives that are

00:42:56.589 --> 00:43:01.513
better than yours--still doesn't
mean that your life is so bad

00:43:01.513 --> 00:43:05.493
that you're better off dead.
It's easy to lose sight of

00:43:05.493 --> 00:43:08.710
that, right?
Here we are sliding down and

00:43:08.710 --> 00:43:13.210
all we see is the fact that
we're moving down.

00:43:13.210 --> 00:43:18.031
It's natural to get caught up
in the thought "I'm better off

00:43:18.031 --> 00:43:22.380
dead," but it's a mistake.
You're not better off dead.

00:43:22.380 --> 00:43:24.769
This situation,
I suppose, is probably--I

00:43:24.769 --> 00:43:28.413
always worry when I spend--when
I end this class talking about

00:43:28.413 --> 00:43:30.812
suicide,
because what's the major cause

00:43:30.812 --> 00:43:33.610
of death among teenagers?
Well, it's suicide.

00:43:33.610 --> 00:43:36.609
That's not really so all that
surprising, because teenagers

00:43:36.609 --> 00:43:38.420
are pretty healthy,
as people go.

00:43:38.420 --> 00:43:42.743
And so the--you're either going
to get killed by an accident or

00:43:42.743 --> 00:43:46.440
you're going to get killed by
doing it to yourself.

00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:51.332
The kind of mistake that I
think leads most teenagers into

00:43:51.332 --> 00:43:55.110
killing themselves is something
like this.

00:43:55.110 --> 00:43:57.400
They've broken up with their
girlfriend.

00:43:57.400 --> 00:44:01.731
They've flunked out of school.
They didn't get into medical

00:44:01.731 --> 00:44:04.769
school or law school or what
have you.

00:44:04.769 --> 00:44:07.867
And they think to themselves,
"Oh, from here on out,

00:44:07.867 --> 00:44:10.874
my life's not worth living."
And the answer is,

00:44:10.874 --> 00:44:13.704
no, that's actually,
as an objective matter,

00:44:13.704 --> 00:44:16.974
probably not the case.
Even if your life would be less

00:44:16.974 --> 00:44:20.171
worth living than you had hoped
it would be, it's still better

00:44:20.171 --> 00:44:23.673
than nothing.
Of course, in the typical case,

00:44:23.673 --> 00:44:27.539
I suppose what it really looks
like is this.

00:44:27.539 --> 00:44:31.260
Small dip then continues
wonderfully.

00:44:31.260 --> 00:44:35.062
But you lose sight of all the
good stuff yet to come while

00:44:35.062 --> 00:44:39.165
you're in the middle of the dip.
So, although I'm taking time

00:44:39.165 --> 00:44:43.162
now to talk about the question,
under what circumstances might

00:44:43.162 --> 00:44:45.849
suicide be a rationally
justified one?

00:44:45.849 --> 00:44:51.421
I should hasten to add the
remark that I'm fairly confident

00:44:51.421 --> 00:44:55.551
that for nobody in this class
would suicide,

00:44:55.551 --> 00:44:59.010
in fact, be a rational
decision.

00:44:59.010 --> 00:45:02.375
Now, that doesn't mean it
couldn't turn out to be a

00:45:02.375 --> 00:45:05.000
rational decision later in your
life,

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:09.283
but that, very likely,
overwhelmingly likely,

00:45:09.283 --> 00:45:12.956
is not one now.
Well, a couple other cases that

00:45:12.956 --> 00:45:15.154
I still want to have us
consider, but I think that's

00:45:15.154 --> 00:45:17.568
probably enough for today,
so we'll take it up there next

00:45:17.568 --> 00:45:18.568
time.

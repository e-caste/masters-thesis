00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:04.350
Prof: Coming in to the
home stretch.

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.380
We're moving towards the
Constitution;

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:09.290
it's kind of amazing,
kind of weird.

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.230
And so, as a matter of fact,
that's what we're going to be

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.240
doing with today's lecture,
which is going to get us on the

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.660
road to the Federal Convention.
 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.430
Now just a quick review before
we plunge down the road.

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.330
On Thursday,
as I hope you all remember,

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.651
I talked about some of the
problems of the Articles of

00:00:31.651 --> 00:00:35.599
Confederation and I talked about
things that caused confusion or

00:00:35.599 --> 00:00:38.670
complications like boundaries
between states;

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.937
I talked about Vermont;
I talked about the state of

00:00:41.937 --> 00:00:43.870
Franklin;
I talked about Shays'

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:46.470
Rebellion, toward the end of the
lecture.

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.180
And throughout that lecture,
from time to time,

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.962
I talked about some people who
were strong advocates for a

00:00:54.962 --> 00:00:59.410
stronger central government for
the Confederation--

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:00.950
and I mentioned a few names in
passing.

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.628
I think I mentioned James
Madison, and I mentioned

00:01:03.628 --> 00:01:05.870
Alexander Hamilton,
and I mentioned George

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:06.689
Washington.
 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.280
Obviously, there are others.
 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.250
Those are just three big-name
contenders.

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:11.250
There are others.
 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.469
Though at first,
we're not talking about a

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:15.150
massive group of people here.
 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.450
We're talking about a select
group of people who really

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.239
believe that there has to be a
stronger national government.

00:01:22.239 --> 00:01:25.592
Now these men saw a host of
problems with the Articles of

00:01:25.592 --> 00:01:26.549
Confederation.
 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.950
I mentioned some of them on
Thursday.

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.379
One of them you'll actually see
a couple of times in the course

00:01:33.379 --> 00:01:34.879
of today's lecture.
 

00:01:34.879 --> 00:01:38.256
So these nationalists--they saw
problems with things like

00:01:38.256 --> 00:01:40.958
currency,
congressional indecision,

00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:45.470
the fact that Congress was
powerless to enforce things,

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.290
obviously boundary
complications between states,

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:52.890
and a host of other problems
that, at least to them,

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.792
signaled the really obvious
need for some kind of

00:01:55.792 --> 00:01:59.601
wide-ranging national political
reform that would put more power

00:01:59.601 --> 00:02:00.688
at the center.
 

00:02:00.688 --> 00:02:04.674
And for years and years and
years these people kept calling

00:02:04.674 --> 00:02:08.179
for some kind of a national
convention to reform the

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:09.210
government.
 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:12.744
Now, as I mentioned just a
minute ago when I said sort of a

00:02:12.744 --> 00:02:15.443
select group,
it's important to note that

00:02:15.443 --> 00:02:18.763
this drive for a stronger
national government was not

00:02:18.763 --> 00:02:21.653
initially widespread,
and as a matter of fact,

00:02:21.653 --> 00:02:24.460
there were any number of
reasons for people really to

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.590
fear the idea of strengthening
the national government.

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.585
And you're going to get a sense
of some of these reasons next

00:02:30.585 --> 00:02:33.780
week when you look at some of
the Federalist essays,

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.542
because part of what the
Federalist essays are

00:02:36.542 --> 00:02:39.508
doing is explaining and
promoting the new Constitution,

00:02:39.508 --> 00:02:40.940
or hopefully,
what will be the new

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:41.590
Constitution.
 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.571
But the other thing that the
Federalist essays are

00:02:44.571 --> 00:02:47.810
doing is they're actually trying
to calm people's fears down.

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.026
Like: 'okay,
you think that if you approve

00:02:50.026 --> 00:02:53.066
of this new Constitution,
horrible things will happen,

00:02:53.066 --> 00:02:56.120
but here's yet another way in
which horrible things won't

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.720
happen.'
 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.276
So you'll see that kind of as a
running subtheme in the

00:02:59.276 --> 00:03:02.258
Federalist essays too,
when you read them next week.

00:03:02.258 --> 00:03:05.139
And, as I suggested in the
lecture,

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:09.177
I think on Thursday's lecture,
obviously after you'd fought a

00:03:09.177 --> 00:03:13.080
Revolution against what you
perceived to be as a tyrannical

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.837
centralized power--
right?--the British

00:03:15.837 --> 00:03:19.782
monarchy--it would make perfect
sense in general to be a little

00:03:19.782 --> 00:03:22.008
worried about centralized power.
 

00:03:22.008 --> 00:03:28.091
Plus, many people assumed that
America was just bound to drift

00:03:28.091 --> 00:03:31.680
back into what it had been
before.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.520
And this fear goes actually
even into the 1790s.

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.361
People assumed that because
people in America were so used

00:03:37.361 --> 00:03:40.080
to one way of things,
it was kind of a nifty little

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.560
experiment they were undertaking
now,

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.479
but as a matter of fact,
over time,

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:45.895
when push came to shove,
everything would sort of drift

00:03:45.895 --> 00:03:47.150
back to where it had been.
 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.772
So the assumption is:
waiting out there in the wings

00:03:49.772 --> 00:03:52.500
somewhere there is an
aristocracy that's going to leap

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.586
up and take over as soon as they
have an opportunity and then

00:03:55.586 --> 00:03:58.030
suddenly--
poof--we'll have an aristocracy

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.852
and maybe a monarchy and
everything will go back to the

00:04:00.852 --> 00:04:01.949
way it was before.
 

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:05.141
So it makes sense that people
were nervous about centralized

00:04:05.141 --> 00:04:06.966
power,
and it makes sense that the

00:04:06.966 --> 00:04:09.639
states would be nervous too
about centralized power,

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:13.537
because they'd be nervous about
giving up power to whatever this

00:04:13.537 --> 00:04:16.629
stronger centralized government
was going to be.

00:04:16.629 --> 00:04:21.274
So what today's lecture is
going to do is look at how

00:04:21.274 --> 00:04:26.100
things evolved over the course
of just a few years,

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.514
so that by 1787,
which is where we're going to

00:04:27.514 --> 00:04:30.726
be on Thursday,
there actually was a call for a

00:04:30.726 --> 00:04:35.509
national convention to reform or
amend the government,

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:38.793
and then ultimately,
the new nation really did end

00:04:38.793 --> 00:04:42.680
up strengthening the national
government significantly,

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.589
which is all in all pretty
remarkable.

00:04:44.589 --> 00:04:47.141
When you think about some of
what I've just been talking

00:04:47.141 --> 00:04:48.689
about,
it is pretty remarkable that

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:50.060
there was that much change
over--

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:54.079
in the end--what isn't that
huge an expanse of time.

00:04:54.079 --> 00:04:56.975
And, as you'll see,
part of what's important to

00:04:56.975 --> 00:04:59.379
think about--
and I'll mention it a couple

00:04:59.379 --> 00:05:01.519
times in the course of today's
lecture--

00:05:01.519 --> 00:05:06.149
is the way in which America
found its way into strengthening

00:05:06.149 --> 00:05:09.363
the government because,
as you're going to see,

00:05:09.363 --> 00:05:12.528
there's a series of individual
events or individual meetings.

00:05:12.528 --> 00:05:17.069
None of them really focused on
centralizing,

00:05:17.069 --> 00:05:19.620
strengthening,
the central national

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:22.238
government,
although over time each one of

00:05:22.238 --> 00:05:24.689
these decisions,
as you're going to see today,

00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:26.410
pushed things in that
direction.

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:29.264
So in a sense what you're going
to see in today's lecture

00:05:29.264 --> 00:05:32.591
particularly,
is how the new nation backed

00:05:32.591 --> 00:05:36.629
its way into a stronger central
government,

00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:38.180
one decision at a time.
 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:40.569
They didn't leap into a new
stronger government.

00:05:40.569 --> 00:05:43.817
They backed their way in,
aided of course by some really

00:05:43.817 --> 00:05:47.242
strong nationalists in the
background trying to push things

00:05:47.242 --> 00:05:50.473
in that direction like Madison,
Hamilton, Washington,

00:05:50.473 --> 00:05:53.000
and the other crew of really
firm nationalists.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.911
So basically that's kind of the
subtheme, or one of them at

00:05:56.911 --> 00:05:58.800
least, of today's lecture.
 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:03.168
It's how the new nation backed
its way in to a new stronger

00:06:03.168 --> 00:06:06.560
central government,
one decision at a time.

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:10.288
And in a sense,
it shouldn't be surprising that

00:06:10.288 --> 00:06:14.745
one of the main issues that
pushed this series of events

00:06:14.745 --> 00:06:18.720
into operation was commence,
the question of commerce.

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:23.305
With thirteen different states,
each with its own arrangement

00:06:23.305 --> 00:06:27.278
of commerce, there were bound to
be complications.

00:06:27.278 --> 00:06:29.930
And obviously,
commerce is a big deal.

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:31.250
Right? Commerce matters.
 

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:32.300
Commerce is prosperity.
 

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:34.110
Commerce is livelihoods.
 

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:37.500
Commerce is going to make or
break individual states and make

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:38.970
or break the new nation.
 

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:41.220
If you think back to the
Revolution,

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:44.552
and think back to some of the
things that people were upset

00:06:44.552 --> 00:06:46.399
about,
again, you're going to realize

00:06:46.399 --> 00:06:49.190
commerce is underlying a lot of
what we're talking about here.

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:49.920
Right?
 

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:53.194
Rights are intermingled with
these thoughts about

00:06:53.194 --> 00:06:56.744
commerce--but we talked about
taxation, direct taxes,

00:06:56.744 --> 00:06:58.860
imports, exports,
shipping.

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:02.247
All of these kinds of things
and more were among the many

00:07:02.247 --> 00:07:05.391
central components that were
also helping to fuel the

00:07:05.391 --> 00:07:06.300
Revolution.
 

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:10.206
So it shouldn't be a really big
surprise that they continued to

00:07:10.206 --> 00:07:13.800
play a major role in the
development of the new nation.

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:17.500
And so what we're going to see
in today's lecture is that the

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:21.261
strong nationalists pushing for
a stronger national government

00:07:21.261 --> 00:07:24.899
would find that problems of
commerce sometimes opened little

00:07:24.899 --> 00:07:28.168
doors of opportunity for
political reform in ways that

00:07:28.168 --> 00:07:30.449
might not have been expected.
 

00:07:30.449 --> 00:07:30.757
Okay.
 

00:07:30.757 --> 00:07:32.540
So that's what I want to do.
 

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:35.221
I want to sort of show the
little process of reform,

00:07:35.221 --> 00:07:37.800
or, the process of change over
time and action.

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:41.797
And one major moment of
opportunity that I'm going to

00:07:41.797 --> 00:07:46.639
start by talking about here for
these nationalists took place in

00:07:46.639 --> 00:07:50.637
1785 because of a local
complication between Virginia

00:07:50.637 --> 00:07:54.790
and Maryland about navigating
the Potomac River.

00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:55.067
Okay.
 

00:07:55.067 --> 00:07:58.283
So this is--It's local and it
also has to do with shipping,

00:07:58.283 --> 00:07:59.560
again more commerce.
 

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:03.911
So in response to this
question, both Virginia and

00:08:03.911 --> 00:08:08.709
Maryland named commissioners to
meet in Alexandria,

00:08:08.709 --> 00:08:12.449
Virginia, to discuss the issue
and work out some kind of a

00:08:12.449 --> 00:08:13.040
policy.
 

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:16.439
So it doesn't seem necessarily
like a really big deal.

00:08:16.439 --> 00:08:20.730
There were a total of seven men
named to be at this meeting.

00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:22.060
There were three from Maryland.
 

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:25.360
There were four from Virginia,
including James Madison.

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:28.509
Unfortunately,
Virginia Governor Patrick Henry

00:08:28.509 --> 00:08:31.870
somehow or other managed to
fumble something,

00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:36.058
so he basically didn't tell the
four Virginia delegates when the

00:08:36.058 --> 00:08:40.048
meeting was happening and where
the meeting was happening.

00:08:40.048 --> 00:08:42.126
It's one of those
administrative mistakes that you

00:08:42.126 --> 00:08:44.840
don't realize when you make it,
it will be remembered forever.

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:46.499
[laughs]
Sorry, Governor Henry,

00:08:46.499 --> 00:08:47.440
but you goofed.
 

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:50.078
So the Virginia delegation is
never told about where or when

00:08:50.078 --> 00:08:50.840
the meeting is.
 

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:54.561
The Maryland delegates arrive
in Alexandria and find nobody

00:08:54.561 --> 00:08:55.779
waiting for them.
 

00:08:55.779 --> 00:08:57.710
It's like: 'we're here.'
 

00:08:57.710 --> 00:09:00.320
And ultimately,
two Virginia delegates,

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:02.408
the ones who lived closest to
Alexandria,

00:09:02.408 --> 00:09:05.006
managed to make their way there
as soon as they found out they

00:09:05.006 --> 00:09:06.200
were supposed to be there.
 

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:08.759
Madison was not one of the
people who ended up being there.

00:09:08.759 --> 00:09:12.288
So now you have five people,
three from Maryland,

00:09:12.288 --> 00:09:15.028
two from Virginia,
meeting in Alexandria and now

00:09:15.028 --> 00:09:18.469
they begin talking about the
problem and maybe entering into

00:09:18.469 --> 00:09:20.158
some kind of negotiation.
 

00:09:20.158 --> 00:09:24.514
Now meanwhile,
George Washington knew about

00:09:24.514 --> 00:09:26.379
this conference.
 

00:09:26.379 --> 00:09:30.460
And given that Mount Vernon is
not that far away--

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:33.379
just down the road from the
town of Alexandria--

00:09:33.379 --> 00:09:38.033
he invited the commissioners
out to Mount Vernon to meet

00:09:38.033 --> 00:09:38.710
there.
 

00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:43.220
Now Washington wasn't just
being hospitable.

00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:48.346
He actually had a really keen
interest in having a canal built

00:09:48.346 --> 00:09:51.721
on the Potomac,
partly to promote its use and

00:09:51.721 --> 00:09:55.125
hopefully thus to make
Alexandria an important link to

00:09:55.125 --> 00:09:58.658
the West and thus a big center
of shipping in the United

00:09:58.658 --> 00:09:59.428
States.
 

00:09:59.428 --> 00:10:02.222
So Washington's thinking about
promoting the importance of

00:10:02.222 --> 00:10:04.870
Alexandria through doing
something with the Potomac.

00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:07.657
And he had been interested in
this idea of building a canal

00:10:07.657 --> 00:10:08.330
for a while.
 

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:12.187
And he had met with engineers,
and he had served in various

00:10:12.187 --> 00:10:14.587
committees,
and this was really something

00:10:14.587 --> 00:10:16.360
that he felt very strongly
about--

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:19.200
enough so that apparently
during a certain period of time,

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:22.702
anyone who went to visit him at
Mount Vernon ended up just

00:10:22.702 --> 00:10:24.730
getting talked to about canals.
 

00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:24.970
Right?
 

00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:26.889
You just knew in that phase of
Washington's life,

00:10:26.889 --> 00:10:29.009
if you visit him at Mount
Vernon, you're going to hear

00:10:29.009 --> 00:10:29.730
about canals.
 

00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:32.571
So, as one visitor to Mount
Vernon put it at the time,

00:10:32.571 --> 00:10:34.928
"Hearing little else for
two days ...

00:10:34.928 --> 00:10:39.308
I confess completely infected
me with canal mania."

00:10:39.308 --> 00:10:39.572
Okay.
 

00:10:39.572 --> 00:10:42.149
So Washington is suffering from
canal mania too.

00:10:42.149 --> 00:10:45.293
So he invites these
commissioners to meet at his

00:10:45.293 --> 00:10:48.692
home at Mount Vernon,
knowing that there he can wine

00:10:48.692 --> 00:10:51.623
and dine them and hopefully
encourage some kind of

00:10:51.623 --> 00:10:54.104
compromise,
and maybe even promote the

00:10:54.104 --> 00:10:55.808
development of the Potomac.
 

00:10:55.808 --> 00:10:59.394
The meeting at Mount Vernon was
ultimately known as,

00:10:59.394 --> 00:11:02.769
logically enough,
the Mount Vernon Conference.

00:11:02.769 --> 00:11:03.980
Surprise, surprise.
 

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:05.937
This should be an easy one to
remember, the Mount Vernon

00:11:05.937 --> 00:11:06.399
Conference.
 

00:11:06.399 --> 00:11:13.750
It took place on March 25,1785,
and continued for three days.

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:18.100
Mount Vernon Conference,
March 25,1785.

00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:22.764
In the end, the Mount Vernon
Conference not only settled some

00:11:22.764 --> 00:11:26.355
matters of navigation,
but it also dealt with things

00:11:26.355 --> 00:11:28.908
like customs duties between the
two states,

00:11:28.908 --> 00:11:32.250
trade regulations between the
two states,

00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:36.073
and made recommendations about
somehow or other coordinating

00:11:36.073 --> 00:11:39.639
one state's currency with the
other state's currency.

00:11:39.639 --> 00:11:43.533
And the delegates also
recommended that they meet

00:11:43.533 --> 00:11:48.158
annually to keep channels of
cooperation and communication

00:11:48.158 --> 00:11:48.889
open.
 

00:11:48.889 --> 00:11:51.322
There's the key to the Mount
Vernon Conference:

00:11:51.322 --> 00:11:53.490
let's meet annually to talk
about this.

00:11:53.490 --> 00:11:58.158
So although it wasn't intended
to set any kind of a precedent,

00:11:58.158 --> 00:12:03.308
that conference ends up being a
step in the direction of some

00:12:03.308 --> 00:12:07.772
kind of regular interstate
cooperation apart from the

00:12:07.772 --> 00:12:10.090
Confederation Congress.
 

00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:12.964
It's not just a local
conference about the Potomac and

00:12:12.964 --> 00:12:13.668
two states.
 

00:12:13.668 --> 00:12:17.375
Now it's proposing some kind of
long-term something in which two

00:12:17.375 --> 00:12:20.787
states get together and sort of
figure out how to cooperate

00:12:20.787 --> 00:12:22.139
amongst themselves.
 

00:12:22.139 --> 00:12:25.693
And a little side note that
actually won't really play a

00:12:25.693 --> 00:12:29.442
role in today's lecture but
it'll sort of echo something in

00:12:29.442 --> 00:12:31.769
Thursday's lecture:
In a sense,

00:12:31.769 --> 00:12:34.845
the Mount Vernon Conference
ended up kind of violating

00:12:34.845 --> 00:12:37.629
Virginia's instructions to its
commissioners,

00:12:37.629 --> 00:12:39.774
because the Virginia assembly,
in appointing the

00:12:39.774 --> 00:12:41.690
commissioners,
had said, 'Okay.

00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:45.091
So for you to approve of
something, three out of the four

00:12:45.091 --> 00:12:48.371
of you have to approve of
it--right?--but only two guys

00:12:48.371 --> 00:12:49.769
actually showed up.
 

00:12:49.769 --> 00:12:53.080
So even though the two guys
were there and voted and things

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:56.620
happened, three out of four of
them didn't vote on anything.

00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:56.937
Right?
 

00:12:56.937 --> 00:12:58.633
So officially,
formally speaking,

00:12:58.633 --> 00:13:01.546
they weren't abiding by the
mandate that they had gotten

00:13:01.546 --> 00:13:04.279
from their home state,
and I only mention this now

00:13:04.279 --> 00:13:06.871
because this will echo with some
of things that happen in

00:13:06.871 --> 00:13:08.908
conjunction with the Federal
Convention,

00:13:08.908 --> 00:13:12.298
the Constitutional Convention,
on Thursday too.

00:13:12.298 --> 00:13:12.643
Okay.
 

00:13:12.643 --> 00:13:16.351
So let's pause here for a
minute just to note how these

00:13:16.351 --> 00:13:19.649
people backed their way into
this agreement,

00:13:19.649 --> 00:13:22.706
because the Mount Vernon
Conference didn't consist of

00:13:22.706 --> 00:13:26.408
five really ardent nationalists
just trying to find a sneaky way

00:13:26.408 --> 00:13:29.524
to do something that'll push
people towards being more

00:13:29.524 --> 00:13:31.700
organized in a centralized way.
 

00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:34.467
The conference wasn't branded
as anything other than a meeting

00:13:34.467 --> 00:13:36.918
for commissioners from Maryland
and Virginia to discuss

00:13:36.918 --> 00:13:37.600
navigation.
 

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:40.418
That led into a conversation
about interstate trade.

00:13:40.418 --> 00:13:44.053
That led into a decision to
maybe meet regularly and talk

00:13:44.053 --> 00:13:45.740
about this more broadly.
 

00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:48.554
So in a sense,
what begins this chain of

00:13:48.554 --> 00:13:53.029
events--a somewhat significant
interstate agreement--is kind of

00:13:53.029 --> 00:13:54.330
unintentional.
 

00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:56.879
It's something really practical
that gets it going.

00:13:56.879 --> 00:13:58.509
We've seen this a lot in this
course--

00:13:58.509 --> 00:14:00.714
right?--something very
practical that moves people to

00:14:00.714 --> 00:14:02.850
take action,
and then there are really

00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:06.149
interesting outcomes from that
response to something,

00:14:06.149 --> 00:14:07.548
some really practical need.
 

00:14:07.548 --> 00:14:10.596
And as we'll see,
given all of the fears about

00:14:10.596 --> 00:14:13.958
centralized power,
in some ways it's this kind of

00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:16.527
informal,
indirect way of proceeding

00:14:16.527 --> 00:14:20.172
that's maybe the best way for
people to move towards

00:14:20.172 --> 00:14:24.673
centralizing or to move towards
giving a central government more

00:14:24.673 --> 00:14:25.460
power.
 

00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:28.058
We're going to see that again
and again today.

00:14:28.058 --> 00:14:28.441
Okay.
 

00:14:28.441 --> 00:14:31.645
So it's informal,
it's indirect in a sense,

00:14:31.645 --> 00:14:36.148
but the Mount Vernon Conference
did have the support of some

00:14:36.148 --> 00:14:37.980
eager nationalists.
 

00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:40.056
So certainly James Madison was
in favor of it,

00:14:40.056 --> 00:14:42.779
even though he didn't make
it--but he was in favor of it.

00:14:42.779 --> 00:14:46.023
He should have been there,
and of course George Washington

00:14:46.023 --> 00:14:48.982
is the host--so yet another
strong nationalist who is

00:14:48.982 --> 00:14:50.519
clearly in favor of it.
 

00:14:50.519 --> 00:14:53.984
Both men certainly would have
done their best to usher the

00:14:53.984 --> 00:14:56.720
agreement through the Virginia
legislature.

00:14:56.720 --> 00:15:01.028
It also passed the Maryland
legislature as well.

00:15:01.028 --> 00:15:05.753
Even more significant,
Maryland proposed bringing

00:15:05.753 --> 00:15:08.274
Delaware in,
the next time they

00:15:08.274 --> 00:15:11.470
met--inviting them to attend the
next year's meeting--

00:15:11.470 --> 00:15:14.318
and the commissioners
themselves when they were at

00:15:14.318 --> 00:15:17.365
Mount Vernon,
they thought maybe they should

00:15:17.365 --> 00:15:19.129
invite Pennsylvania too.
 

00:15:19.129 --> 00:15:19.498
Okay.
 

00:15:19.498 --> 00:15:23.922
So now we potentially have four
states maybe agreeing to meet

00:15:23.922 --> 00:15:27.830
every year to talk about
interstate trade matters.

00:15:27.830 --> 00:15:31.178
Now James Madison,
who's thinking nationally,

00:15:31.178 --> 00:15:34.957
hoped that the Virginia
legislature would agree to

00:15:34.957 --> 00:15:39.200
submit this agreement to the
Confederation Congress,

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:42.162
and then maybe all of the
states would agree to meet in

00:15:42.162 --> 00:15:43.370
this way every year.
 

00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:46.080
And of course that idea did not
happen;

00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:46.965
it failed.
 

00:15:46.965 --> 00:15:50.770
Instead, the Virginia
legislature proposed a

00:15:50.770 --> 00:15:55.373
resolution that called on the
other states to appoint

00:15:55.373 --> 00:15:57.817
delegates,
and to deliberately sit back

00:15:57.817 --> 00:16:00.470
and consider,
quote, "the trade of the

00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:02.860
United States"
as a group,

00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:06.605
and to propose some kind of an
act regarding the issue that

00:16:06.605 --> 00:16:09.575
could be sent to the
Confederation Congress for

00:16:09.575 --> 00:16:10.350
passage.
 

00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:14.604
So clearly, amidst fears about
centralized power at the time,

00:16:14.604 --> 00:16:18.647
this is a pretty significant
suggestion on the part of the

00:16:18.647 --> 00:16:20.418
Virginia legislature.
 

00:16:20.418 --> 00:16:24.342
And it's worth noting that even
the mere suggestion of something

00:16:24.342 --> 00:16:28.142
like this had to be helped along
in its passage by some really

00:16:28.142 --> 00:16:29.450
careful strategy.
 

00:16:29.450 --> 00:16:33.066
So although Madison really
clearly wanted this proposal to

00:16:33.066 --> 00:16:36.346
go through the legislature,
Madison is not the guy who

00:16:36.346 --> 00:16:38.034
proposed it,
because if Madison,

00:16:38.034 --> 00:16:39.941
Mr. Nationalist,
stood up and said,

00:16:39.941 --> 00:16:42.320
'Hey, I really think that we
should all meet,

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:44.711
all of the states together,
and consider the trade of the

00:16:44.711 --> 00:16:46.590
United States,' everyone would
have said,

00:16:46.590 --> 00:16:48.009
'Oh, it's Mr. Nationalist
speaking.

00:16:48.009 --> 00:16:48.759
I'm sorry.
 

00:16:48.759 --> 00:16:49.918
We don't trust you.'
 

00:16:49.918 --> 00:16:52.850
So instead another
man--actually John Tyler,

00:16:52.850 --> 00:16:55.678
who is the father of a future
President Tyler--

00:16:55.678 --> 00:16:59.019
is not particularly known for
his nationalist sentiments,

00:16:59.019 --> 00:17:01.379
so his motives wouldn't be held
suspect,

00:17:01.379 --> 00:17:03.918
and he's the guy who actually
makes this proposal.

00:17:03.918 --> 00:17:06.952
So even just to recommend
something along these lines,

00:17:06.952 --> 00:17:08.900
people are being very
strategic.

00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:12.417
So ultimately there is a
decision to hold a meeting about

00:17:12.417 --> 00:17:15.118
American trade,
a meeting that supposedly is

00:17:15.118 --> 00:17:17.568
going to include all of the
states.

00:17:17.568 --> 00:17:22.631
It's agreed to by the Virginia
legislature and it's scheduled

00:17:22.631 --> 00:17:26.426
to meet in Annapolis,
Maryland, the next year,

00:17:26.426 --> 00:17:28.028
September 1786.
 

00:17:28.028 --> 00:17:28.423
Okay.
 

00:17:28.423 --> 00:17:31.420
So that's been going on in the
South.

00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:33.075
We have Virginia,
we have Maryland,

00:17:33.075 --> 00:17:34.730
maybe Delaware and
Pennsylvania.

00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:37.789
But it's not as though none of
this sort of activity or none of

00:17:37.789 --> 00:17:40.160
these fears have been happening
in the North,

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:42.750
and they had been,
also involving trade.

00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:45.413
So at roughly the same time
that all of this is going on in

00:17:45.413 --> 00:17:48.119
the South,
the Massachusetts legislature

00:17:48.119 --> 00:17:52.486
ended up proposing their own
resolution to think more broadly

00:17:52.486 --> 00:17:56.532
about the national government,
again, spurred by trade

00:17:56.532 --> 00:17:57.558
complications.
 

00:17:57.558 --> 00:18:01.892
Basically, Northerners,
and in particular merchants in

00:18:01.892 --> 00:18:04.008
Boston,
found themselves affected by

00:18:04.008 --> 00:18:06.557
British trade restrictions in
some ways that they really

00:18:06.557 --> 00:18:08.095
didn't like,
and they wanted the

00:18:08.095 --> 00:18:10.190
Confederation Congress to do
something about it,

00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:13.171
and they also realized the
Confederation Congress probably

00:18:13.171 --> 00:18:15.838
didn't have enough power to do
anything about it.

00:18:15.838 --> 00:18:18.500
So the Massachusetts
legislature, thinking along

00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:21.160
these lines, proposed something
more broadly.

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:24.474
So instead of just saying,
'Well, let's get together and

00:18:24.474 --> 00:18:27.608
talk about trade,' the
Massachusetts state government

00:18:27.608 --> 00:18:30.804
asked the Massachusetts
delegates in the Confederation

00:18:30.804 --> 00:18:34.480
Congress to suggest calling a
general convention of all of the

00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:38.460
states to revise the Articles of
Confederation as a whole.

00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:40.588
Okay. That's a big suggestion.
 

00:18:40.588 --> 00:18:43.465
So the Massachusetts
legislature basically asks its

00:18:43.465 --> 00:18:45.940
delegates in the Confederation
Congress,

00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:48.510
'Hey, would you--here's a
proposal for us to call some

00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:51.179
kind of meeting for all of the
states just to revise the

00:18:51.179 --> 00:18:51.808
Articles.
 

00:18:51.808 --> 00:18:54.068
Would you present it to the
Confederation Congress?'

00:18:54.068 --> 00:18:57.868
And the response of the three
Massachusetts delegates in the

00:18:57.868 --> 00:19:00.960
Confederation Congress is really
interesting,

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:04.633
because it shows you why it
seemingly took things happening

00:19:04.633 --> 00:19:08.496
outside of official channels,
like the Mount Vernon

00:19:08.496 --> 00:19:13.220
Conference, for there to be
broad interstate changes.

00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:16.121
Because basically,
in short, the Massachusetts

00:19:16.121 --> 00:19:19.666
delegates responded by just
refusing to submit the whole

00:19:19.666 --> 00:19:22.440
proposal to the Confederation
Congress.

00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:24.670
And their written response is
really interesting.

00:19:24.670 --> 00:19:26.259
I'm going to quote just a
couple sentences from it here--

00:19:26.259 --> 00:19:29.635
and this is what the delegates
in the Confederation Congress

00:19:29.635 --> 00:19:32.440
responded to the people back in
Massachusetts:

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:35.749
"Many are of opinion,
the States have not yet had

00:19:35.749 --> 00:19:39.067
experience sufficient to
determine the extent of powers

00:19:39.067 --> 00:19:41.710
vested in Congress by the
Confederation;

00:19:41.710 --> 00:19:44.498
&amp; therefore that every
measure at this time,

00:19:44.498 --> 00:19:46.990
proposing an alteration is
premature ...

00:19:46.990 --> 00:19:50.510
The present Confederation with
all its inconveniences is

00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:53.840
preferable to the risque of
general dissentions &amp;

00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:56.713
animosities,
which may approach to Anarchy

00:19:56.713 --> 00:19:59.358
&amp; prepare the way to a
ruinous system of

00:19:59.358 --> 00:20:00.588
Government."
 

00:20:00.588 --> 00:20:03.516
And what specifically did these
guys think when they said

00:20:03.516 --> 00:20:06.130
"general dissentions and
animosities"?

00:20:06.130 --> 00:20:11.078
Well, in part they meant the
following, again their words:

00:20:11.078 --> 00:20:13.818
"We are apprehensive &amp;
it is our duty,

00:20:13.818 --> 00:20:15.970
to declare it,
that such a measure"--

00:20:15.970 --> 00:20:18.345
reforming the
Articles--"would produce

00:20:18.345 --> 00:20:21.211
thro'out the Union,
an exertion of the friends of

00:20:21.211 --> 00:20:24.512
an Aristocracy to Send members
who would promote a change of

00:20:24.512 --> 00:20:27.029
Government: &amp;
we can form some judgment of

00:20:27.029 --> 00:20:29.741
the plan,
which Such members would report

00:20:29.741 --> 00:20:30.890
to Congress."
 

00:20:30.890 --> 00:20:31.152
Okay.
 

00:20:31.152 --> 00:20:33.671
So essentially the
Massachusetts delegates to the

00:20:33.671 --> 00:20:35.558
Confederation Congress say:
'No,

00:20:35.558 --> 00:20:38.425
we're not even going to
consider this idea of revising

00:20:38.425 --> 00:20:41.564
the Articles because it's going
to result in what they call

00:20:41.564 --> 00:20:43.619
"baleful
aristocracies."

00:20:43.619 --> 00:20:45.308
Right? This is dangerous.
 

00:20:45.308 --> 00:20:47.357
It's opening things up so that
it's going to get more

00:20:47.357 --> 00:20:47.910
centralized.
 

00:20:47.910 --> 00:20:50.190
Scary aristocratic types are
going to take over.

00:20:50.190 --> 00:20:51.180
Bad things will happen.
 

00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:53.920
"Poof"--spirit of the
Revolution all gone.

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:58.858
So here in 1785,
we have Maryland,

00:20:58.858 --> 00:21:01.700
we have Virginia,
we have Pennsylvania,

00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:05.957
we have Delaware trying to do
something centralizing about

00:21:05.957 --> 00:21:08.455
trade,
and Massachusetts also

00:21:08.455 --> 00:21:13.271
suggesting some pretty bold
reform because of problems with

00:21:13.271 --> 00:21:14.019
trade.
 

00:21:14.019 --> 00:21:18.203
What was still pending at this
time was the meeting that had

00:21:18.203 --> 00:21:22.390
been scheduled to meet in
Annapolis in September of 1786.

00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:27.640
Now, Madison for one was not
overly optimistic about whatever

00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:30.788
was going to happen at
Annapolis,

00:21:30.788 --> 00:21:32.894
because he basically
assumed--and he probably was

00:21:32.894 --> 00:21:35.424
smart to assume it--
as soon as you ask all of the

00:21:35.424 --> 00:21:37.910
states to agree to meet and
decide anything,

00:21:37.910 --> 00:21:39.829
it's not going to work, right?
 

00:21:39.829 --> 00:21:41.470
You're just bound to fail.
 

00:21:41.470 --> 00:21:44.165
And indeed, he gets to
Annapolis and things just don't

00:21:44.165 --> 00:21:44.980
look too good.
 

00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:48.154
As he wrote to his brother:
"I came to this place a

00:21:48.154 --> 00:21:50.809
day or two ago,
where I found two commissioners

00:21:50.809 --> 00:21:51.328
only.
 

00:21:51.328 --> 00:21:53.894
A few more have since come in,
but the prospect of a

00:21:53.894 --> 00:21:54.700
sufficient no.
 

00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:58.038
to make the meeting respectable
is not flattering."

00:21:58.038 --> 00:22:01.653
And sure enough,
ultimately only five states

00:22:01.653 --> 00:22:06.108
sent delegates who arrived in
time for the meeting.

00:22:06.108 --> 00:22:08.224
Even Maryland,
the host state,

00:22:08.224 --> 00:22:12.528
did not send delegates to the
Annapolis Convention--okay;

00:22:12.528 --> 00:22:16.563
that's a real snub--out of fear
that it transcended the power of

00:22:16.563 --> 00:22:18.420
the Confederation Congress.
 

00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:20.901
So the host state wasn't
represented at the

00:22:20.901 --> 00:22:22.970
Annapolis--Maryl
and--convention.

00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:26.117
Three other states besides
Maryland also chose not to send

00:22:26.117 --> 00:22:30.453
delegates: South Carolina,
Georgia, and Connecticut--yay,

00:22:30.453 --> 00:22:33.708
Connecticut--
all decided they would not send

00:22:33.708 --> 00:22:34.410
delegates.
 

00:22:34.410 --> 00:22:38.010
And then delegates from some of
the states that were at the

00:22:38.010 --> 00:22:40.337
outer edges of the Union--
Massachusetts,

00:22:40.337 --> 00:22:41.598
New Hampshire,
Rhode Island,

00:22:41.598 --> 00:22:46.108
North Carolina--they arrived
too late to take part.

00:22:46.108 --> 00:22:47.978
[laughs]
All these people having these

00:22:47.978 --> 00:22:50.150
sort of weird administrative bad
moments.

00:22:50.150 --> 00:22:52.155
Sorry, guys,
you didn't take place in the

00:22:52.155 --> 00:22:55.214
historic convention in Annapolis
because you left home late or

00:22:55.214 --> 00:22:58.220
whatever it is they did;
they didn't plan well.

00:22:58.220 --> 00:23:01.144
So all of those states are not
represented at the Annapolis

00:23:01.144 --> 00:23:01.798
Convention.
 

00:23:01.798 --> 00:23:03.858
But so, they had all this
fanfare.

00:23:03.858 --> 00:23:05.830
All these nationalists were
like: 'wow, we really need to

00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:06.500
meet about this.'
 

00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:07.558
They finally get a meeting.
 

00:23:07.558 --> 00:23:11.413
It's scheduled for Annapolis,
and now it seems like nobody's

00:23:11.413 --> 00:23:12.588
going to attend.
 

00:23:12.588 --> 00:23:15.122
So as one Delaware delegate
wrote to a friend:

00:23:15.122 --> 00:23:17.880
Should half of the states fail
to participate,

00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:21.388
quote, "How ridiculous
will all this parade

00:23:21.388 --> 00:23:22.509
appear?"
 

00:23:22.509 --> 00:23:24.930
So they're getting ready in
Annapolis to be mortified.

00:23:24.930 --> 00:23:29.180
That after all their efforts:
big deal, nobody cares.

00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:31.945
Now, before we see what
actually transpired in the

00:23:31.945 --> 00:23:34.768
Annapolis Convention,
I want to have a little brief

00:23:34.768 --> 00:23:36.180
James Madison moment.
 

00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:37.759
This is kind of a James Madison
lecture.

00:23:37.759 --> 00:23:38.519
He's going to shine.
 

00:23:38.519 --> 00:23:41.700
But I want to have a little
moment for him here,

00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:44.154
because, as you're going to see
throughout the rest of this

00:23:44.154 --> 00:23:47.244
lecture and also on Thursday,
he does a number of really

00:23:47.244 --> 00:23:50.849
interesting things and
ultimately some really important

00:23:50.849 --> 00:23:53.833
things in 1786 and 1787,
all of them in one way or

00:23:53.833 --> 00:23:56.150
another bound up with
strengthening the government.

00:23:56.150 --> 00:23:58.849
And I brought a very
sophisticated visual aid.

00:23:58.849 --> 00:24:02.598
 
 

00:24:02.598 --> 00:24:03.282
Okay.
 

00:24:03.282 --> 00:24:08.338
So [laughter]
this is James Madison.

00:24:08.338 --> 00:24:11.358
I bring this James Madison
because a graduate student gave

00:24:11.358 --> 00:24:14.114
this to me years ago,
and what really amuses me about

00:24:14.114 --> 00:24:16.180
this--I don't know if you can
tell.

00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:19.387
This is a GI Joe body with a
Madison head stuck on top

00:24:19.387 --> 00:24:21.507
[laughter]
and you can't see really,

00:24:21.507 --> 00:24:24.108
because of the lace covering
his hands.

00:24:24.108 --> 00:24:26.555
He has the kung fu grip thing
going, [laughter]

00:24:26.555 --> 00:24:28.470
like he wants to be holding a
gun.

00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:31.308
So this is buff James Madison.
 

00:24:31.308 --> 00:24:33.140
[laughter]
This is a macho Madison.

00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:36.355
It is the weirdest-looking
thing with this little,

00:24:36.355 --> 00:24:39.180
tiny scholarly head sort of
stuck on top.

00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:41.864
[laughter]
This is my high-tech visual

00:24:41.864 --> 00:24:42.298
aid.
 

00:24:42.298 --> 00:24:42.453
Here.
 

00:24:42.453 --> 00:24:43.410
We'll stick Madison over here.
 

00:24:43.410 --> 00:24:44.720
He actually has a little--Oh.
 

00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:47.499
Look, he's missing a shoe--his
little stand--[laughter]

00:24:47.499 --> 00:24:48.940
this little Madison stand.
 

00:24:48.940 --> 00:24:49.559
Poor guy.
 

00:24:49.559 --> 00:24:50.440
There's no respect.
 

00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:52.627
He's not even getting respect
now in the class during his

00:24:52.627 --> 00:24:52.980
moment.
 

00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:54.038
He's shoeless.
 

00:24:54.038 --> 00:24:54.987
[laughter]
Okay.

00:24:54.987 --> 00:24:57.259
So we're giving Madison some
love.

00:24:57.259 --> 00:24:57.557
Okay.
 

00:24:57.557 --> 00:25:00.824
I do want to look at what
Madison was doing in the month

00:25:00.824 --> 00:25:04.328
before the Annapolis Convention
because it's actually really

00:25:04.328 --> 00:25:05.339
interesting.
 

00:25:05.339 --> 00:25:06.240
He does this twice.
 

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:08.630
He does this for two different
summers.

00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:10.884
He's think--obviously thinking
to himself: okay,

00:25:10.884 --> 00:25:13.665
I don't know what's coming down
the road but there might be

00:25:13.665 --> 00:25:16.130
actual reform happening;
this is very exciting.

00:25:16.130 --> 00:25:19.258
So I'd better prepare myself
for the possibility of

00:25:19.258 --> 00:25:20.509
government reform.
 

00:25:20.509 --> 00:25:24.478
So in this summer of 1786,
he basically does a little

00:25:24.478 --> 00:25:27.912
research project,
and he decides he's going to

00:25:27.912 --> 00:25:30.660
study confederacies of all time.
 

00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:30.816
Right?
 

00:25:30.816 --> 00:25:31.778
He's going to look at ancient
times.

00:25:31.778 --> 00:25:33.029
He's going to look at modern
times.

00:25:33.029 --> 00:25:36.529
He's going to look at every
confederacy that ever existed,

00:25:36.529 --> 00:25:40.088
and then list in some way their
virtues and their vices.

00:25:40.088 --> 00:25:42.998
So in essence,
Madison is going to look over

00:25:42.998 --> 00:25:47.259
all time and then come up with
these rules of confederacies,

00:25:47.259 --> 00:25:49.175
right?--what works,
what doesn't,

00:25:49.175 --> 00:25:52.349
and then hopefully once he
figures that out somehow or

00:25:52.349 --> 00:25:55.942
other maybe it'll help him in
making suggestions to create or

00:25:55.942 --> 00:25:57.740
improve the present one.
 

00:25:57.740 --> 00:26:01.180
Now this is real--This is age
of reason thinking,

00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:05.858
this idea that if you can
figure out the patterns of the

00:26:05.858 --> 00:26:08.123
past,
you can figure out the laws of

00:26:08.123 --> 00:26:10.920
nature and the way that things
are supposed to work.

00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:12.519
And there's a great example.
 

00:26:12.519 --> 00:26:14.828
When I was in grad school,
I guess,

00:26:14.828 --> 00:26:17.237
I read a book that at the time
I thought was really

00:26:17.237 --> 00:26:19.061
fascinating,
which I guess means I'm

00:26:19.061 --> 00:26:21.700
destined to be a professor of
early American history,

00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:23.808
because I am the only one who
finds it fascinating.

00:26:23.808 --> 00:26:25.109
But--and I thought it was
really fascinating.

00:26:25.109 --> 00:26:27.180
It's actually by Adam Smith.
 

00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:28.910
It's called A Theory of
Moral Sentiments,

00:26:28.910 --> 00:26:30.710
and what amazed me about it
was,

00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:35.104
it's Adam Smith coming up with
a sort of theory for patterns of

00:26:35.104 --> 00:26:37.160
human emotion and morality.
 

00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:40.328
So that's, again,
"Age of Reason"

00:26:40.328 --> 00:26:41.160
thinking.
 

00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:43.702
Adam Smith is like:
'okay, I'm going to come up

00:26:43.702 --> 00:26:46.578
with a theory of moral
sentiments and then present it

00:26:46.578 --> 00:26:49.509
to you as to how morality works
in human nature.'

00:26:49.509 --> 00:26:51.608
What I found really interesting
about it was just,

00:26:51.608 --> 00:26:54.798
if you're trying to figure out
the mindset of people in the

00:26:54.798 --> 00:26:56.695
eighteenth--
late eighteenth century,

00:26:56.695 --> 00:26:57.730
that book is helpful.
 

00:26:57.730 --> 00:27:00.575
It may not present the all-time
tried and true theory,

00:27:00.575 --> 00:27:02.240
but it is really interesting.
 

00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:03.940
It says all kinds of sort of
quirky,

00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:06.830
interesting things in there
that--even if some people felt

00:27:06.830 --> 00:27:08.913
that way,
that's really interesting,

00:27:08.913 --> 00:27:12.086
really--because another time
period is really a different

00:27:12.086 --> 00:27:12.710
mindset.
 

00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:16.240
So the Smith book is kind of in
the same spirit as Madison's

00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:19.233
efforts to study all
confederacies and then come up

00:27:19.233 --> 00:27:21.150
with these amazing patterns.
 

00:27:21.150 --> 00:27:23.318
So he's reading through book
after book after book.

00:27:23.318 --> 00:27:26.105
He's keeping record--keeping
little notes about various

00:27:26.105 --> 00:27:29.200
confederations and what he likes
and what he doesn't like and

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:31.160
what worked and what didn't
work--

00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:34.840
really, really trying to figure
out some kind of pattern that's

00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:36.858
going to help the United States.
 

00:27:36.858 --> 00:27:40.738
And supposedly he recorded his
notes in a little notebook that

00:27:40.738 --> 00:27:44.363
was about forty pages long,
that maybe he intended to have

00:27:44.363 --> 00:27:48.035
with him during debate;
maybe he intended to have it

00:27:48.035 --> 00:27:50.900
with him as a sort of writing
reference.

00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:55.058
I love just the whole system
and operation of this.

00:27:55.058 --> 00:27:55.368
Right?
 

00:27:55.368 --> 00:27:58.157
I will figure it all out and
then I will carry it in my

00:27:58.157 --> 00:28:00.946
pocket, my knowledge about all
confederacies over time,

00:28:00.946 --> 00:28:02.598
well, let me look in--Yeah.
 

00:28:02.598 --> 00:28:04.660
So this is very Madison,
very typical Madison.

00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:06.413
And actually,
little bits of that end up

00:28:06.413 --> 00:28:08.528
appearing in the
Federalist essays,

00:28:08.528 --> 00:28:10.335
so if he was thinking it was
going to be a help in his

00:28:10.335 --> 00:28:11.819
writing,
he was right;

00:28:11.819 --> 00:28:13.490
he actually does draw on it.
 

00:28:13.490 --> 00:28:15.864
And so he looks at all these
confederacies,

00:28:15.864 --> 00:28:17.730
and so it's not a big surprise.
 

00:28:17.730 --> 00:28:20.230
What does Madison discover?
 

00:28:20.230 --> 00:28:23.561
Well, basically everywhere he
looks he finds jealousies and

00:28:23.561 --> 00:28:26.779
animosities between member
states of whatever confederacy

00:28:26.779 --> 00:28:28.160
we're talking about.
 

00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:30.970
He sees domestic turmoil.
 

00:28:30.970 --> 00:28:33.380
He sees international
humiliation.

00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:37.848
He sees basically weak unions
or problem unions.

00:28:37.848 --> 00:28:41.049
That's the lesson he draws from
his little survey.

00:28:41.049 --> 00:28:43.279
So this is on his mind.
 

00:28:43.279 --> 00:28:43.670
Right?
 

00:28:43.670 --> 00:28:47.450
He does this little studying
project, and then he heads out

00:28:47.450 --> 00:28:51.358
to Annapolis to join the
Convention in September of 1786.

00:28:51.358 --> 00:28:54.804
Only five states were
represented: New York,

00:28:54.804 --> 00:28:58.890
New Jersey, Pennsylvania,
Delaware, and Virginia.

00:28:58.890 --> 00:29:01.367
I'll repeat that for you:
New York, New Jersey,

00:29:01.367 --> 00:29:03.470
Pennsylvania,
Delaware, and Virginia.

00:29:03.470 --> 00:29:06.871
A total of twelve delegates,
so we're not talking about

00:29:06.871 --> 00:29:08.950
massive numbers of people here.
 

00:29:08.950 --> 00:29:11.682
And logically enough you get
the twelve guys there from the

00:29:11.682 --> 00:29:14.382
five states,
and the first thing they do is,

00:29:14.382 --> 00:29:17.788
they compare what their home
states told them to do.

00:29:17.788 --> 00:29:18.077
Okay.
 

00:29:18.077 --> 00:29:20.088
'Why did your state send you
here?

00:29:20.088 --> 00:29:21.890
Why did your state send you
here?

00:29:21.890 --> 00:29:24.019
Is there actually anything that
we have in common?'

00:29:24.019 --> 00:29:27.865
What they discovered was that
four of the five states had

00:29:27.865 --> 00:29:31.988
instructions from their home
states confining their attention

00:29:31.988 --> 00:29:33.980
to just matters of trade.
 

00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:34.385
Right?
 

00:29:34.385 --> 00:29:34.724
Okay.
 

00:29:34.724 --> 00:29:37.910
Go to Annapolis and talk about
trade, period.

00:29:37.910 --> 00:29:39.910
But we're going to have a New
Jersey moment.

00:29:39.910 --> 00:29:42.790
Is there--Are there New Jersey
people--Oh, we've got New Jersey

00:29:42.790 --> 00:29:43.210
people.
 

00:29:43.210 --> 00:29:44.250
Yes. Okay.
 

00:29:44.250 --> 00:29:46.430
This is a New Jersey--a shining
New Jersey moment.

00:29:46.430 --> 00:29:50.009
So four of the five just said,
'Just consider trade.'

00:29:50.009 --> 00:29:54.117
New Jersey--New Jersey has
three magical words in their

00:29:54.117 --> 00:29:56.019
instructions from home.
 

00:29:56.019 --> 00:29:59.519
And the New Jersey instructions
say: yeah, go ahead,

00:29:59.519 --> 00:30:02.743
consider trade and,
quote, "other important

00:30:02.743 --> 00:30:03.980
matters."
 

00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:04.726
[laughs]
Okay.

00:30:04.726 --> 00:30:06.910
That's the only opening they
needed.

00:30:06.910 --> 00:30:08.519
It's like: 'oh,
other important matters.'

00:30:08.519 --> 00:30:11.018
[laughs]
In that case we can think more

00:30:11.018 --> 00:30:12.858
broadly than trade,
right?

00:30:12.858 --> 00:30:16.409
So New Jersey has the little,
tiny key that lets these people

00:30:16.409 --> 00:30:19.900
meeting at Annapolis at least
think about moving beyond just

00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:21.318
talking about trade.
 

00:30:21.318 --> 00:30:24.207
They talk for three days about
whether they should really

00:30:24.207 --> 00:30:27.249
proceed along any line because
of the magical three words in

00:30:27.249 --> 00:30:28.900
the New Jersey instructions.
 

00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:32.032
They finally decide that yes,
they will take advantage of

00:30:32.032 --> 00:30:35.390
that little opening to talk
about other important matters.

00:30:35.390 --> 00:30:38.865
So they prepared an address to
their own states and to all the

00:30:38.865 --> 00:30:41.430
other states that had decided
not to come,

00:30:41.430 --> 00:30:44.846
or that hadn't made it on time,
that are rushing somewhere from

00:30:44.846 --> 00:30:48.045
North Carolina--
and the address was prepared by

00:30:48.045 --> 00:30:50.634
Alexander Hamilton,
obviously yet another one of

00:30:50.634 --> 00:30:51.690
these strong nationalists.
 

00:30:51.690 --> 00:30:54.038
He's trying,
I think as early as 1780:

00:30:54.038 --> 00:30:56.068
we need a stronger government.
 

00:30:56.068 --> 00:31:01.085
So Hamilton's address asked the
states to name delegates to meet

00:31:01.085 --> 00:31:04.348
in Philadelphia the following
year to,

00:31:04.348 --> 00:31:07.621
quote, "take into
consideration the situation of

00:31:07.621 --> 00:31:10.393
the United States;
to devise such further

00:31:10.393 --> 00:31:14.315
provisions as shall appear to
them necessary to render the

00:31:14.315 --> 00:31:17.961
Constitution of the Federal
Government adequate to the

00:31:17.961 --> 00:31:20.368
exigencies of the Union."
 

00:31:20.368 --> 00:31:20.747
Okay.
 

00:31:20.747 --> 00:31:23.991
So basically,
we need to meet and just think

00:31:23.991 --> 00:31:27.915
more broadly about the
government, is what Hamilton's

00:31:27.915 --> 00:31:29.348
proposal says.
 

00:31:29.348 --> 00:31:33.729
Now again, look at how almost
accidental what we're looking at

00:31:33.729 --> 00:31:37.318
here is, right?--this
significant proposal to alter

00:31:37.318 --> 00:31:38.538
the Articles.
 

00:31:38.538 --> 00:31:41.818
With only a handful of men
present at Annapolis,

00:31:41.818 --> 00:31:44.335
this suggestion almost is more
a matter of desperation like:

00:31:44.335 --> 00:31:46.509
'well we have to come out of
this with something;

00:31:46.509 --> 00:31:49.352
thanks to New Jersey we can do
something, so here,

00:31:49.352 --> 00:31:52.950
let's make a proposal and send
it out and see what happens.'

00:31:52.950 --> 00:31:58.497
And this bold move is grounded
on three words in the New Jersey

00:31:58.497 --> 00:31:59.838
instructions.
 

00:31:59.838 --> 00:32:03.946
Again, it's all of these sort
of out-of-formal-channels,

00:32:03.946 --> 00:32:08.426
informal ways in which people
are promoting some kind of more

00:32:08.426 --> 00:32:10.220
centralizing agenda.
 

00:32:10.220 --> 00:32:13.060
So once the move is taken,
they send this out--the address

00:32:13.060 --> 00:32:13.759
is sent out.
 

00:32:13.759 --> 00:32:17.965
Nationalists like Hamilton and
Madison and others throughout

00:32:17.965 --> 00:32:21.960
the states take full advantage
of it and really push,

00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:24.598
so that something will come of
this;

00:32:24.598 --> 00:32:26.969
there'll be some kind of an
attempt to actually strengthen

00:32:26.969 --> 00:32:28.048
the national government.
 

00:32:28.048 --> 00:32:31.987
In eight states nationalists
managed to get their state

00:32:31.987 --> 00:32:36.654
legislatures to pass resolutions
suggesting precisely the kind of

00:32:36.654 --> 00:32:40.592
broad agenda for a conference
that the Annapolis people

00:32:40.592 --> 00:32:41.538
wanted.
 

00:32:41.538 --> 00:32:43.335
So eight states are like:
'yeah, okay,

00:32:43.335 --> 00:32:45.712
we could get behind a
conference to reconsider the

00:32:45.712 --> 00:32:46.490
government.'
 

00:32:46.490 --> 00:32:49.548
Which brings us to Shays'
Rebellion momentarily,

00:32:49.548 --> 00:32:52.279
because in a really handy
stroke of timing,

00:32:52.279 --> 00:32:54.655
Shays' Rebellion happens right
in the middle of what we're

00:32:54.655 --> 00:32:55.740
talking about right now.
 

00:32:55.740 --> 00:32:55.959
Right?
 

00:32:55.959 --> 00:32:57.568
So they're like:
'well, let's push to try and

00:32:57.568 --> 00:32:58.740
make the government stronger.
 

00:32:58.740 --> 00:33:00.368
Oh, Shays' Rebellion.'
 

00:33:00.368 --> 00:33:00.734
Right?
 

00:33:00.734 --> 00:33:03.602
So the nationalists are like:
'we hate this but,

00:33:03.602 --> 00:33:04.088
yes.'
 

00:33:04.088 --> 00:33:05.692
[laughs]
It's like: 'this is really bad

00:33:05.692 --> 00:33:07.971
but wow, this is a handy PR
tool'--because now they can

00:33:07.971 --> 00:33:09.869
point to Shays' Rebellion and
say, 'Look.

00:33:09.869 --> 00:33:12.538
We're collapsing into chaos.
 

00:33:12.538 --> 00:33:12.788
Wow.
 

00:33:12.788 --> 00:33:15.519
Do we need a stronger national
government.'

00:33:15.519 --> 00:33:18.211
So the timing of it,
if you're a guy who really

00:33:18.211 --> 00:33:21.198
wants a stronger national
government in this period,

00:33:21.198 --> 00:33:23.130
was a good stroke of fortune.
 

00:33:23.130 --> 00:33:26.711
So again, as we're looking at
ultimately what's going to

00:33:26.711 --> 00:33:29.968
become the Constitutional
Convention or the Federal

00:33:29.968 --> 00:33:33.019
Convention,
you can see here some of the

00:33:33.019 --> 00:33:37.039
problems of having a central
government with such diffuse

00:33:37.039 --> 00:33:39.190
powers,
because even now,

00:33:39.190 --> 00:33:40.950
someone says,
'Well,

00:33:40.950 --> 00:33:42.700
let's strengthen the
government'--and then Congress

00:33:42.700 --> 00:33:44.940
takes a long time to think about
the possibility of strengthening

00:33:44.940 --> 00:33:46.910
the government,
surprise, surprise.

00:33:46.910 --> 00:33:51.962
So a committee is appointed to
consider this idea in October of

00:33:51.962 --> 00:33:56.772
1786, and in February of 1787
the committee finally issues a

00:33:56.772 --> 00:33:57.670
report.
 

00:33:57.670 --> 00:34:02.156
And the report says:
well, revising the Articles

00:34:02.156 --> 00:34:03.588
maybe, right?
 

00:34:03.588 --> 00:34:05.190
None of this,
let's review everything.

00:34:05.190 --> 00:34:08.228
Revising the Articles,
okay, maybe we can go along

00:34:08.228 --> 00:34:11.887
with that and the states should
name delegates to attend the

00:34:11.887 --> 00:34:14.679
conference to just improve the
Articles,

00:34:14.679 --> 00:34:17.000
not to just evaluate the needs
of the Union.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:22.869
So four states ultimately
follow that formula.

00:34:22.869 --> 00:34:23.335
Right?
 

00:34:23.335 --> 00:34:25.739
They say, 'Okay,
only revise.'

00:34:25.739 --> 00:34:28.471
Other states follow the
Annapolis formula and say,

00:34:28.471 --> 00:34:29.139
'Oh, okay.
 

00:34:29.139 --> 00:34:31.289
Let's actually reconsider the
government.'

00:34:31.289 --> 00:34:33.775
So the meeting at
Philadelphia--what ends up being

00:34:33.775 --> 00:34:37.779
the Constitutional Convention--
starts out with a confused,

00:34:37.779 --> 00:34:41.262
contradictory mandate,
because there's no general

00:34:41.262 --> 00:34:43.989
agreement about number one,
what the meeting is really

00:34:43.989 --> 00:34:45.760
supposed to accomplish and
number two,

00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:48.010
how it's even supposed to be
planned.

00:34:48.010 --> 00:34:52.239
So eight states get the call
from Annapolis and respond.

00:34:52.239 --> 00:34:55.231
The other states are--A number
of the other states wait until

00:34:55.231 --> 00:34:58.324
the Confederation Congress says
something and then they respond

00:34:58.324 --> 00:35:00.420
to the Confederation Congress
instead.

00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:02.757
So ironically,
in a meeting that's supposed to

00:35:02.757 --> 00:35:05.510
repair shortcomings of the
Confederation Congress,

00:35:05.510 --> 00:35:08.675
that meeting itself is being
complicated by shortcomings of

00:35:08.675 --> 00:35:10.260
the Confederation Congress.
 

00:35:10.260 --> 00:35:14.884
You can see how it's very hard
to do anything in a really

00:35:14.884 --> 00:35:18.268
national manner with all of the
states.

00:35:18.268 --> 00:35:21.916
So obviously the nationalists
are really hoping things are

00:35:21.916 --> 00:35:24.539
going to follow the Annapolis
formula,

00:35:24.539 --> 00:35:26.239
as Washington put it,
revising the--

00:35:26.239 --> 00:35:29.221
not just revising the Articles,
but probing "the defects

00:35:29.221 --> 00:35:31.059
of the Constitution to the
bottom,

00:35:31.059 --> 00:35:33.000
and providing radical
cures."

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.130
So that's what the nationalists
want.

00:35:35.130 --> 00:35:38.300
As we're going to see on
Thursday,

00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:41.585
strong nationalists were really
active in the month before the

00:35:41.585 --> 00:35:44.139
Convention,
planning and preparing to push

00:35:44.139 --> 00:35:45.460
forward their agenda.
 

00:35:45.460 --> 00:35:48.217
And here we have James Madison,
shoeless [laughs]

00:35:48.217 --> 00:35:51.664
James Madison--where did his
shoe go?--shoeless James Madison

00:35:51.664 --> 00:35:52.929
moment number two.
 

00:35:52.929 --> 00:35:54.699
Well, see, I guess that he
makes professors happy,

00:35:54.699 --> 00:35:56.980
because he liked studying,
all by himself,

00:35:56.980 --> 00:35:58.570
like: I'll do a summer study
project,

00:35:58.570 --> 00:36:00.329
which--He's a scholarly founder.
 

00:36:00.329 --> 00:36:02.099
Scholars like James Madison.
 

00:36:02.099 --> 00:36:06.300
So scholarly project number
two: He decides that now--

00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:08.706
just like before he was looking
for virtues and vices of

00:36:08.706 --> 00:36:12.206
confederacies over time--
now he's going to look at vices

00:36:12.206 --> 00:36:15.956
in the American confederacy,
and he actually titles this

00:36:15.956 --> 00:36:18.748
document "Vices of the
Political System of the

00:36:18.748 --> 00:36:21.150
U.***States,"
or the United States.

00:36:21.150 --> 00:36:23.985
So he again comes up with a
list of vices,

00:36:23.985 --> 00:36:27.858
problems in the American
system, and he lists things like

00:36:27.858 --> 00:36:31.039
states trespassing on each
other's rights;

00:36:31.039 --> 00:36:35.376
like a lack of unity between
states even when unity is

00:36:35.376 --> 00:36:39.775
desperately required;
like the fact that states can

00:36:39.775 --> 00:36:44.719
encroach on federal authority
without any repercussions;

00:36:44.719 --> 00:36:48.827
states violate treaties and
again--well, who's going to do

00:36:48.827 --> 00:36:50.268
anything about it?
 

00:36:50.268 --> 00:36:54.110
So he's making a list of all
these vices and some of them,

00:36:54.110 --> 00:36:57.420
again, ultimately end up being
talked about in the essays that

00:36:57.420 --> 00:36:59.809
he contributes to the
Federalist.

00:36:59.809 --> 00:37:03.860
So Madison basically has this
long-term study project in

00:37:03.860 --> 00:37:08.204
preparation for what comes to be
known as the Constitutional

00:37:08.204 --> 00:37:09.309
Convention.
 

00:37:09.309 --> 00:37:12.750
As we'll talk about on
Thursday, he also arrives--

00:37:12.750 --> 00:37:14.518
in addition to all of his
studying--

00:37:14.518 --> 00:37:17.153
with a draft plan of
government, so in case he hasn't

00:37:17.153 --> 00:37:19.789
done enough: now I will arrive
with the draft plan of

00:37:19.789 --> 00:37:20.550
government.
 

00:37:20.550 --> 00:37:24.849
And we will talk more about
what his plan suggests for an

00:37:24.849 --> 00:37:27.920
entirely new Constitution on
Thursday.

00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:33.670
In the last bit of the course
of today's class,

00:37:33.670 --> 00:37:35.927
I want to mention one other
thing I think just because I

00:37:35.927 --> 00:37:38.105
don't think I'm going to have
time to talk about it on

00:37:38.105 --> 00:37:39.690
Thursday,
but I don't want to go without

00:37:39.690 --> 00:37:41.693
mentioning it,
because it's yet another one of

00:37:41.693 --> 00:37:44.208
the sort of weird,
interesting things that Madison

00:37:44.208 --> 00:37:46.891
does associated with the
Constitutional Convention and

00:37:46.891 --> 00:37:49.726
it'll have more meaning after
Thursday's lecture but I'll

00:37:49.726 --> 00:37:50.739
mention it now.
 

00:37:50.739 --> 00:37:53.179
And some of you may already
know this,

00:37:53.179 --> 00:37:55.969
because you may have used this
in papers or things for classes,

00:37:55.969 --> 00:37:59.510
but Madison took notes and he
didn't just take notes;

00:37:59.510 --> 00:38:00.650
he really took notes.
 

00:38:00.650 --> 00:38:05.039
He noted almost all of the
proceedings of the Convention.

00:38:05.039 --> 00:38:08.452
Of all of the delegates,
he ended up taking the most

00:38:08.452 --> 00:38:10.940
careful,
the most consistent,

00:38:10.940 --> 00:38:14.641
not quite minute by minute,
not quite comprehensive,

00:38:14.641 --> 00:38:17.690
but really thorough notes of
what went on at that Convention,

00:38:17.690 --> 00:38:20.190
of what people said,
of how they argued,

00:38:20.190 --> 00:38:22.530
about what they argued about,
about what was done.

00:38:22.530 --> 00:38:23.639
His notes are really amazing.
 

00:38:23.639 --> 00:38:24.400
They're published.
 

00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:25.050
They're easy to find.
 

00:38:25.050 --> 00:38:26.440
They're even on the Internet.
 

00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:29.809
The Library of Congress has--I
think they're called

00:38:29.809 --> 00:38:33.922
Farrand's Notes of Debate
or something but they're--you

00:38:33.922 --> 00:38:37.389
can see Madison's notes;
you can read Madison's notes.

00:38:37.389 --> 00:38:39.780
He actually invented some kind
of a little shorthand,

00:38:39.780 --> 00:38:42.041
so during the day with his
little shorthand he was copying

00:38:42.041 --> 00:38:43.469
down everything that people
said,

00:38:43.469 --> 00:38:46.320
and then at night he was
transposing that back into real

00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:46.840
writing.
 

00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:50.056
And again, this was like his
project of the Constitutional

00:38:50.056 --> 00:38:50.789
Convention.
 

00:38:50.789 --> 00:38:53.554
And his notes--They're
published and they're easy to

00:38:53.554 --> 00:38:56.755
find, but the fact is his actual
notes are at the Library of

00:38:56.755 --> 00:38:57.460
Congress.
 

00:38:57.460 --> 00:39:01.534
And, a million years ago--I'm
not going to say how many years

00:39:01.534 --> 00:39:02.856
ago--
many years ago,

00:39:02.856 --> 00:39:05.000
I worked at the Library of
Congress,

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.579
and I worked on exhibits at the
Library of Congress,

00:39:07.579 --> 00:39:09.800
museum exhibits, curating them.
 

00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:11.744
And the Library of Congress is
an amazing place to do that

00:39:11.744 --> 00:39:13.833
because,
how much fun is it to be able

00:39:13.833 --> 00:39:17.559
to pick stuff from the Library
of Congress to put in exhibits?

00:39:17.559 --> 00:39:18.760
They have everything.
 

00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:19.710
They have amazing stuff.
 

00:39:19.710 --> 00:39:22.677
They have the contents of
Abraham Lincoln's pockets on the

00:39:22.677 --> 00:39:23.510
night he died.
 

00:39:23.510 --> 00:39:26.722
They have drafts of the
Gettysburg Address and the

00:39:26.722 --> 00:39:30.329
Declaration of--and it's just
amazing, amazing stuff.

00:39:30.329 --> 00:39:34.436
I remember one exhibit I worked
on, on the Bicentennial of

00:39:34.436 --> 00:39:35.230
Congress.
 

00:39:35.230 --> 00:39:38.889
We had a little room where we
were stacking stuff for the

00:39:38.889 --> 00:39:40.827
exhibit,
and it was like well,

00:39:40.827 --> 00:39:44.309
it's space instruments from the
first voyage into space and a

00:39:44.309 --> 00:39:48.184
draft of the Gettysburg Address,
and here is--it was like aah,

00:39:48.184 --> 00:39:50.710
[laughter]
like waves of history emanating

00:39:50.710 --> 00:39:51.880
out of the room.
 

00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:57.800
So they have Madison's notes
there and the Library,

00:39:57.800 --> 00:39:59.630
and--I don't know if the same
thing exists now--

00:39:59.630 --> 00:40:01.210
but I know that a million years
ago,

00:40:01.210 --> 00:40:04.409
when I worked at the library,
they had the top treasures--

00:40:04.409 --> 00:40:06.411
I think it was the top twelve
treasures of the Library of

00:40:06.411 --> 00:40:08.130
Congress,
and they kept them in a vault.

00:40:08.130 --> 00:40:11.666
And it was like,
the Gutenberg Bible,

00:40:11.666 --> 00:40:15.597
Madison's notes,
Jefferson's draft of the

00:40:15.597 --> 00:40:17.170
declaration.
 

00:40:17.170 --> 00:40:19.599
What else?
 

00:40:19.599 --> 00:40:22.876
George Mason's Virginia
Declaration of Rights,

00:40:22.876 --> 00:40:26.081
just like: aah,
sort of objects in this vault

00:40:26.081 --> 00:40:28.340
in the Library of Congress.
 

00:40:28.340 --> 00:40:30.994
And supposedly,
when these items come out of

00:40:30.994 --> 00:40:34.512
the vault, they are supposed to
be accompanied by an armed

00:40:34.512 --> 00:40:35.130
guard.
 

00:40:35.130 --> 00:40:38.289
Okay, which I thought was a
rule, but like,

00:40:38.289 --> 00:40:39.777
'ha, ha, sure,
armed guard,

00:40:39.777 --> 00:40:42.063
okay, high security'--
but lo and behold,

00:40:42.063 --> 00:40:45.007
when I wanted to get some of
George Mason's notes to put in

00:40:45.007 --> 00:40:47.295
the exhibit,
there was a guy with a gun

00:40:47.295 --> 00:40:48.429
walking next to me.
 

00:40:48.429 --> 00:40:49.686
[laughter]
It was like:

00:40:49.686 --> 00:40:52.443
George Mason,
we're protecting George Mason

00:40:52.443 --> 00:40:53.855
from--
I don't know who is going to

00:40:53.855 --> 00:40:55.820
come running down the halls of
the Library of Congress--

00:40:55.820 --> 00:40:57.960
but anyway they really meant it
with the armed guard.

00:40:57.960 --> 00:41:01.452
But so, for that same exhibit,
I got to look through Madison's

00:41:01.452 --> 00:41:01.909
notes.
 

00:41:01.909 --> 00:41:05.106
I got to pick a page from
Madison's notes to put in the

00:41:05.106 --> 00:41:05.699
exhibit.
 

00:41:05.699 --> 00:41:08.300
And it's just amazing to see
them because--

00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:10.809
okay, they're the notes from
the moment,

00:41:10.809 --> 00:41:13.643
so there's the guy basically
recording how the Constitution's

00:41:13.643 --> 00:41:14.400
being created.
 

00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:17.382
And Madison--[laughs]
I was about to say something

00:41:17.382 --> 00:41:19.329
which this doesn't illustrate.
 

00:41:19.329 --> 00:41:20.929
He's actually a little guy.
 

00:41:20.929 --> 00:41:24.039
[laughs/laughter]
He's not GI Joe.

00:41:24.039 --> 00:41:26.373
He's a small man,
a quiet man,

00:41:26.373 --> 00:41:30.556
sort of bookish kind of a guy,
so he has this little,

00:41:30.556 --> 00:41:33.210
tiny, bookish,
perfect, meticulous

00:41:33.210 --> 00:41:34.659
handwriting.
 

00:41:34.659 --> 00:41:36.867
His handwriting was just like
you think James Madison's

00:41:36.867 --> 00:41:37.929
handwriting ought to be.
 

00:41:37.929 --> 00:41:40.719
You look at it and you're like,
'that must be James Madison.'

00:41:40.719 --> 00:41:44.563
And so, there is this box of
these little slips of paper with

00:41:44.563 --> 00:41:48.215
his little, meticulous Madison
notes of what he saw at the

00:41:48.215 --> 00:41:49.690
Federal Convention.
 

00:41:49.690 --> 00:41:52.876
For some magical reason--I
think it was long enough ago

00:41:52.876 --> 00:41:56.829
that nobody will get fired by my
saying this--there was no guard.

00:41:56.829 --> 00:41:58.710
[laughs]
They just left me with the box,

00:41:58.710 --> 00:42:03.309
so I was sort of like:
aah, Madison's notes,

00:42:03.309 --> 00:42:05.704
this is so exciting--like,
yeah, I think it'll take me an

00:42:05.704 --> 00:42:07.820
hour to find a page,
so that I could leaf through

00:42:07.820 --> 00:42:08.630
and see everything.
 

00:42:08.630 --> 00:42:10.940
It's kind of an amazing
artifact.

00:42:10.940 --> 00:42:14.871
And the fact of the matter is,
Madison was doing that for a

00:42:14.871 --> 00:42:16.429
very specific reason.
 

00:42:16.429 --> 00:42:20.420
Madison--This whole generation
tends to think about posterity.

00:42:20.420 --> 00:42:23.630
I'll talk about that a little
bit in the last lecture as well,

00:42:23.630 --> 00:42:26.768
but they're very posterity
minded so part of the reason why

00:42:26.768 --> 00:42:30.123
Madison goes through all of this
trouble to record what's going

00:42:30.123 --> 00:42:32.637
on at the Convention--
although I think he actually

00:42:32.637 --> 00:42:33.510
doesn't record jokes.
 

00:42:33.510 --> 00:42:36.159
I think some other people's
notes--

00:42:36.159 --> 00:42:38.280
now that I'm thinking about
it--some other people's notes

00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:40.440
suggest that Madison did not
think constitution-making was

00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:40.820
funny.
 

00:42:40.820 --> 00:42:42.786
[laughter]
There will be no jokes in

00:42:42.786 --> 00:42:43.800
Madison's notes.
 

00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:45.340
They're pretty sad jokes.
 

00:42:45.340 --> 00:42:47.820
Eighteenth-century jokes often
are not like:

00:42:47.820 --> 00:42:49.610
ha, ha--and it's like
[laughter]

00:42:49.610 --> 00:42:50.130
okay.
 

00:42:50.130 --> 00:42:52.420
[laughs] It's kind of sad.
 

00:42:52.420 --> 00:42:54.824
There is a book called
something like George

00:42:54.824 --> 00:42:57.806
Washington Laughing,
but it's George Washington

00:42:57.806 --> 00:43:00.420
laughing at other people's jokes
because [laughter]

00:43:00.420 --> 00:43:02.199
I guess he didn't tell them.
 

00:43:02.199 --> 00:43:05.320
Anyway, so I think Madison
expunged the humor out of the

00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:07.510
whole situation,
but he's thinking about

00:43:07.510 --> 00:43:10.070
posterity--not necessarily by
taking out the jokes--

00:43:10.070 --> 00:43:13.115
but he's really thinking about
the fact that somewhere down the

00:43:13.115 --> 00:43:14.748
road,
if this actually works,

00:43:14.748 --> 00:43:18.199
if this Constitution actually
survives and actually functions,

00:43:18.199 --> 00:43:20.179
it's going to be this amazing
thing.

00:43:20.179 --> 00:43:22.677
It's going to be a room of
people that deliberated and

00:43:22.677 --> 00:43:25.128
thought about government and
then created it based on

00:43:25.128 --> 00:43:27.250
deliberating in a really
purposeful way,

00:43:27.250 --> 00:43:29.699
which almost never happens when
you're creating a government,

00:43:29.699 --> 00:43:32.550
and then they created what
Madison hoped would be a fair,

00:43:32.550 --> 00:43:35.780
just, small "r"
republican government.

00:43:35.780 --> 00:43:37.804
So he's thinking:
well, if I take all of these

00:43:37.804 --> 00:43:39.726
notes,
and I record this whole process

00:43:39.726 --> 00:43:41.376
down,
it's almost like a little

00:43:41.376 --> 00:43:44.097
guidebook to future countries
that might want to make

00:43:44.097 --> 00:43:47.050
republican governments--
like: here's how we did it.

00:43:47.050 --> 00:43:49.963
And that was the idea behind
what he was doing--was,

00:43:49.963 --> 00:43:53.391
he really did want to preserve
the process, and that's pretty

00:43:53.391 --> 00:43:55.449
much what he did with his notes.
 

00:43:55.449 --> 00:43:57.733
So those of you who are
interested, again they're kind

00:43:57.733 --> 00:43:59.460
of easy to find;
they're all over the place.

00:43:59.460 --> 00:44:00.960
F-a-r-r-a-n-d,
Max Farrand,

00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:03.385
I think is the most famous
version of them,

00:44:03.385 --> 00:44:05.349
but they're very easy to find.
 

00:44:05.349 --> 00:44:08.614
I think I will end there;
I will not move on to talk

00:44:08.614 --> 00:44:09.539
about Madison's plan.
 

00:44:09.539 --> 00:44:13.369
I will talk about the plan and
the Constitution on Thursday.

00:44:13.369 --> 00:44:16.940
Those of you have not yet
handed in papers should be

00:44:16.940 --> 00:44:20.579
handing in papers--and I will
see you on Thursday.

00:44:20.579 --> 00:44:26.000

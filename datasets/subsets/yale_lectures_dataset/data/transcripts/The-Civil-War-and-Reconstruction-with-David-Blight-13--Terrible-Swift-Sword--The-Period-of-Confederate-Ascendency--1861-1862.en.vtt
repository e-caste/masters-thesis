00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:14.806
Professor David Blight:
This week you're reading

00:00:14.806 --> 00:00:18.785
Hospital Sketches,
the short and in some ways

00:00:18.785 --> 00:00:25.890
extraordinary little novel,
written by Louisa May Alcott,

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.041
based upon her--Louisa May
Alcott of Little Women

00:00:30.041 --> 00:00:34.600
fame, if you happen to have
grown up on that book,

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:40.024
daughter of Bronson Alcott,
a famous and extremely

00:00:40.024 --> 00:00:46.444
eccentric New England reformer
and utopian--but she went to

00:00:46.444 --> 00:00:51.547
war,
as a young nurse--couldn't stay

00:00:51.547 --> 00:01:00.117
away--and she kept her sketches
about her experiences of a young

00:01:00.117 --> 00:01:07.599
woman confronting the horror of
Civil War hospitals.

00:01:07.599 --> 00:01:12.747
This is a photograph of--it is
not Louisa May Alcott,

00:01:12.747 --> 00:01:18.785
I don't think--of one of those
young nurses sitting in a Civil

00:01:18.785 --> 00:01:25.950
War hospital in 1863,
probably writing a letter;

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:32.615
they spent a lot of their time
writing letters for sick or

00:01:32.615 --> 00:01:37.970
dying or wounded soldiers.
I think what you can find in

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.388
Alcott's novel,
among other things--it's almost

00:01:41.388 --> 00:01:44.360
like a descriptive documentary
novel;

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.915
it's almost like she summed up
her diary--is the human

00:01:48.915 --> 00:01:52.010
encounter, particularly a
woman's,

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:59.411
a young woman's encounter with
what war does to the human body,

00:01:59.411 --> 00:02:05.060
the human psyche,
to human beings.

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.267
Now, good Lord,
it is eighteen years ago,

00:02:09.267 --> 00:02:15.157
Ken Burns produced--can it
really be?--a series on Public

00:02:15.157 --> 00:02:19.680
Television called The Civil
War,

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.449
as every opening of it says,
brought to you by General

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:27.969
Motors.
Nine episodes and eleven hours,

00:02:27.969 --> 00:02:32.689
garnered the largest Public
Television audience ever.

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:36.924
The estimate was that the first
time through about thirty

00:02:36.924 --> 00:02:41.385
million Americans watched it,
and then it's been rerun many,

00:02:41.385 --> 00:02:45.054
many times.
I went to Germany to teach for

00:02:45.054 --> 00:02:49.530
a year in 1992 and '93,
and when I arrived in the Fall

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.182
of 1992,
on German National Television

00:02:52.182 --> 00:02:55.923
they were running the Ken Burns
film series, all eleven hours of

00:02:55.923 --> 00:02:59.310
it,
dubbed into German.

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.912
And it was weird,
because there was one male

00:03:03.912 --> 00:03:09.050
voice and one female voice for
all the voices.

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.720
And of course one of the
tricks, or one of the

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.163
techniques, one of the quite
brilliant techniques of Burns'

00:03:15.163 --> 00:03:18.664
film was the many different
voices he used--Garrison Keillor

00:03:18.664 --> 00:03:21.618
for Walt Whitman,
Sam Waterson for Abraham

00:03:21.618 --> 00:03:25.722
Lincoln, et cetera--voices that
you, in many ways--or Americans

00:03:25.722 --> 00:03:29.760
in many ways--were comfortable
with in their living rooms.

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.135
They knew Sam Waterson;
they didn't know him as well as

00:03:32.135 --> 00:03:34.160
they know him now from Law
&amp; Order;

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.448
but they knew Garrison
Keillor's voice,

00:03:37.448 --> 00:03:41.342
and when Garrison Keillor came
on every night,

00:03:41.342 --> 00:03:44.468
it was Walt Whitman.
At any rate,

00:03:44.468 --> 00:03:48.400
I was astonished at the
reaction in Germany.

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.083
There were articles in the
paper, editorials and so on and

00:03:52.083 --> 00:03:54.542
so on.
I had one German student come

00:03:54.542 --> 00:03:57.757
up to me one day,
after watching an episode of it

00:03:57.757 --> 00:04:00.370
and listening to one of my
lectures,

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:04.210
and he said,
"Why were there so many sunsets

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:08.050
and moon rises in that
documentary film?"

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:12.689
I said, "Wellâ€¦"--he
caught me off guard.

00:04:12.689 --> 00:04:15.270
I said, "Well it's a good
question."

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:19.398
Probably because Burns is a
sentimental filmmaker,

00:04:19.398 --> 00:04:24.199
and there's a great deal of
sentiment in the structure,

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:29.860
and in the music and in the
mode of that film series.

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.604
And I defy you to watch one or
two hours and not be humming be

00:04:34.604 --> 00:04:38.960
the "Ashokan Farewell" in the
shower the next morning.

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:55.835
It is a haunting violin.
It wasn't, as some people say,

00:04:55.835 --> 00:04:58.930
written for that film series,
it's much older.

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.842
At any rate,
it is assigned in the course,

00:05:02.842 --> 00:05:08.403
at least major parts of it.
You can access it--I'm actually

00:05:08.403 --> 00:05:12.640
going to assign you episodes two
through nine;

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:18.394
that's eight out of the nine.
If you skip one or two only the

00:05:18.394 --> 00:05:20.450
gods will know,
I'm sure, but they will know.

00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:28.044
It is all available on the
Internet, at Yale,

00:05:28.044 --> 00:05:32.391
through the Film Archive.
How many of you have done this

00:05:32.391 --> 00:05:35.699
before for courses?
Fabulous, you've done this.

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:39.222
All right, I checked this
morning, the URL--if you can

00:05:39.222 --> 00:05:41.583
read this;
I don't know if you can read

00:05:41.583 --> 00:05:45.060
this, can you read this?
Yes, in the front.

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:47.960
In the back?
No.

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:54.190
How about now?
Whoa!

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:58.382
yale.edu/clabs--c-labs,
I don't know what

00:05:58.382 --> 00:06:02.050
that--something--that stands
for.

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:06.221
That's for Macs.
They tell me that this is

00:06:06.221 --> 00:06:09.036
better on PCs,
easier on PCs than Macs,

00:06:09.036 --> 00:06:13.480
and you might have to download
a patch to do it on a Mac.

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:17.699
True, false?
Don't know?

00:06:17.699 --> 00:06:20.740
Anybody done it recently,
in a course?

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:23.964
Help?
You all raised your hands,

00:06:23.964 --> 00:06:25.780
you've done this before.
Don't remember?

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:28.750
That's also easy.
Okay, good.

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:32.673
Over the next five--including
Spring Break week--you're in

00:06:32.673 --> 00:06:37.166
Jamaica, Spring Break week,
you can access Ken Burns' film,

00:06:37.166 --> 00:06:41.917
you can be humming the "Ashokan
Farewell" in the shower with

00:06:41.917 --> 00:06:44.803
somebody in Jamaica.
[Laughter]

00:06:44.803 --> 00:06:49.663
That's terrible,
the best laugh I've had in this

00:06:49.663 --> 00:06:54.626
course was--[Laughter]
You're just like everybody

00:06:54.626 --> 00:06:56.341
else.
At any rate,

00:06:56.341 --> 00:06:58.386
that's the URL,
ladies and gentleman,

00:06:58.386 --> 00:07:01.680
and then you--you need to use
your net ID to access it.

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:05.166
If you have any problem with
this let us know immediately and

00:07:05.166 --> 00:07:08.086
we will help you.
It is assigned,

00:07:08.086 --> 00:07:13.447
and we're going to discuss it.
I love a final exam

00:07:13.447 --> 00:07:18.270
question--don't always use
it--that actually draws upon it

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:23.850
as a source;
just thought I'd say that.

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:26.759
Okay, there also is in the
syllabus this week,

00:07:26.759 --> 00:07:29.734
of course, a very vague
reading--you're reading

00:07:29.734 --> 00:07:32.716
Hospital Sketches,
which is short,

00:07:32.716 --> 00:07:36.997
but then it says selective
choices or selections from about

00:07:36.997 --> 00:07:41.351
fifty pages of documents in the
Gienapp book and about forty

00:07:41.351 --> 00:07:45.409
pages of dispatches and
documents and letters by Lincoln

00:07:45.409 --> 00:07:49.038
in the Lincoln reader.
We're going to pin that down

00:07:49.038 --> 00:07:52.282
for you at our lunch today and
you'll be fired an email before

00:07:52.282 --> 00:07:54.523
this afternoon,
perhaps--and then maybe

00:07:54.523 --> 00:07:57.928
individualized by your teaching
assistant as to which of those

00:07:57.928 --> 00:08:01.110
documents you might especially
want to concentrate on.

00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:03.643
But in those two sections of
Gienapp and Johnson,

00:08:03.643 --> 00:08:06.439
if you haven't looked yet--and
you should--you get,

00:08:06.439 --> 00:08:10.615
day by day in some cases,
you get Lincoln's orders and

00:08:10.615 --> 00:08:14.882
dispatches to his generals,
his attempt to become the War

00:08:14.882 --> 00:08:19.051
President, including that first
document in that section where

00:08:19.051 --> 00:08:23.015
Lincoln lays--right after the
disaster at Bull Run--he lays

00:08:23.015 --> 00:08:25.750
out nine or ten very direct
orders,

00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:28.641
all beginning with the word
"let": let there be this,

00:08:28.641 --> 00:08:30.810
let there be that,
let there by this,

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:34.912
let there by that.
And you also find in these

00:08:34.912 --> 00:08:38.572
documents, especially in the
Gienapp Reader,

00:08:38.572 --> 00:08:43.168
some of those incredibly
megalomaniac letters by George

00:08:43.168 --> 00:08:44.700
B.
McClellan.

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:47.936
If ever there was a more vain
character in American military

00:08:47.936 --> 00:08:50.733
history, and political
history--well there've been a

00:08:50.733 --> 00:08:53.860
lot of vain characters in
American political history,

00:08:53.860 --> 00:09:02.476
God knows--but if ever anybody
left more egregiously vain,

00:09:02.476 --> 00:09:10.941
utterly self-serving letters
and dispatches about his own

00:09:10.941 --> 00:09:15.864
sense of self-glory,
it is McClellan,

00:09:15.864 --> 00:09:20.640
who by all rights probably
should've been court-martialed,

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:24.859
but wasn't;
that's another story we'll come

00:09:24.859 --> 00:09:25.300
back to.

00:09:28.419 --> 00:09:32.200
"Mine eyes have seen the glory
of the coming of the Lord.

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:38.219
He has loosed the fateful
lightning with his terrible

00:09:38.219 --> 00:09:42.492
swift sword.
He is trampling out the vintage

00:09:42.492 --> 00:09:45.830
where the grapes of wrath are
stored."

00:09:45.830 --> 00:09:49.790
It's possibly the most famous
poetry in American music.

00:09:49.790 --> 00:10:00.669
It's also apocalyptic;
some would say purple in its

00:10:00.669 --> 00:10:04.234
blood.
Julia Ward Howe wrote the

00:10:04.234 --> 00:10:08.336
famous "Battle Hymn of the
Republic" in early 1862 while

00:10:08.336 --> 00:10:13.142
overlooking an encampment,
a huge encampment of the Union

00:10:13.142 --> 00:10:17.998
Army near Washington.
And she stayed until sunset and

00:10:17.998 --> 00:10:21.858
saw the fires,
which she called "the watch

00:10:21.858 --> 00:10:24.819
fires."
And she wrote the great

00:10:24.819 --> 00:10:27.980
apocalyptic paean of the Civil
War.

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:31.870
We will come back to this
question, especially next week,

00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:35.970
when we deal with the story,
the problem of emancipation.

00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:39.906
At the beginning of this war,
as we'll see in a moment,

00:10:39.906 --> 00:10:42.750
most people expected something
short,

00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:46.370
might even just be a lot of
fun, a summer outing,

00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:49.840
an adventure,
a chance to whip some Yankees,

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:57.263
maybe shoot a Rebel or two.
But if it became very long at

00:10:57.263 --> 00:11:02.009
all--and that's the point--if it
became very long at all,

00:11:02.009 --> 00:11:04.100
its aims, its goals,
its strategies,

00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:06.250
its purposes would have to
change.

00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:12.169
That's why the thinking people
of 1861 feared a long war.

00:11:12.169 --> 00:11:18.120
Lincoln most definitely and
most prominently;

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:21.270
he feared what,
as he said in his--well,

00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:24.259
he said it in the Second
Inaugural;

00:11:24.259 --> 00:11:29.099
he said it also earlier in his
annual message at the end of

00:11:29.099 --> 00:11:32.603
1861--he feared a long,
quote, "remorseless

00:11:32.603 --> 00:11:36.094
revolutionary struggle."
Because a long,

00:11:36.094 --> 00:11:39.171
remorseless,
revolutionary struggle would

00:11:39.171 --> 00:11:42.480
have very different fundamental
results.

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:45.537
In that Second Inaugural,
again one of those famous

00:11:45.537 --> 00:11:48.455
passages from that speech,
Lincoln said all had

00:11:48.455 --> 00:11:51.830
hoped--that was at the end of
it--"All hoped," he said,

00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:57.570
for, quote, "a result less
fundamental and astounding."

00:11:57.570 --> 00:12:02.699
But because this war will not
be short, it will become all out

00:12:02.699 --> 00:12:07.745
and total, depending on whose
interpretation and argument you

00:12:07.745 --> 00:12:10.510
accept,
in terms of what is modern

00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:13.980
total war--and we'll come back
to that question.

00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:21.950
The results would become
fundamental, and transformative.

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:34.441
Now we always steal titles from
Julia Ward Howe,

00:12:34.441 --> 00:12:42.680
just like we do from Lincoln.

00:12:45.879 --> 00:12:50.080
That's actually a photograph of
Bull Run Creek.

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:53.302
I know it could be a creek
anywhere, I know,

00:12:53.302 --> 00:12:56.149
but trust me,
that's Bull Run Creek.

00:12:56.149 --> 00:13:00.999
There were 523 West Point
graduates who fought in the

00:13:00.999 --> 00:13:05.963
Mexican War, and that war,
back in 1846 to '48 had become

00:13:05.963 --> 00:13:10.122
a kind of, if you like,
military primer for so many of

00:13:10.122 --> 00:13:13.169
them,
and the vast majority of those

00:13:13.169 --> 00:13:18.090
would end up in the Civil War,
on both sides--Ulysses Grant,

00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:21.400
Class of '43;
William Tecumseh Sherman,

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:24.374
Class of '40;
Winfield Scott Hancock,

00:13:24.374 --> 00:13:28.850
Class of '44;
George Thomas, Class of '40;

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:33.690
George S. Meade, Class of '35;
Joseph Hooker, Class of '30;

00:13:33.690 --> 00:13:37.940
John Sedgwick, Class of '37;
Joseph E. Johnston;

00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:42.611
most notably Robert E.
Lee, Class of 1829,

00:13:42.611 --> 00:13:48.649
first in his class,
later commandant at West Point.

00:13:48.649 --> 00:13:51.525
They'd all learned a kind of
warrior culture,

00:13:51.525 --> 00:13:56.169
if you like.
They all take a very deep and

00:13:56.169 --> 00:13:59.759
abiding oath.
It was a very difficult thing

00:13:59.759 --> 00:14:02.906
to do for West Point graduates
on the southern side,

00:14:02.906 --> 00:14:05.929
to abandon that oath and go
with their states.

00:14:05.929 --> 00:14:13.750
But of course many,
many, many of them did.

00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:17.172
As Oliver Otis Howard--a West
Point graduate,

00:14:17.172 --> 00:14:21.684
later Union Corps Commander,
lost his arm in the Petersburg

00:14:21.684 --> 00:14:25.884
Campaign and later first
leader--head of the Freedmen's

00:14:25.884 --> 00:14:30.474
Bureau after the Civil War and
for whom Howard University is

00:14:30.474 --> 00:14:34.419
named--said,
quote, "Probably no other place

00:14:34.419 --> 00:14:39.275
existed where men grappled more
sensitively with the troublesome

00:14:39.275 --> 00:14:42.380
problems of secession."
No kidding.

00:14:46.019 --> 00:14:52.810
Now the numbers of this--there
was a kind of a stampede of West

00:14:52.810 --> 00:14:59.710
Point cadets back to the South,
at least to a certain degree.

00:14:59.710 --> 00:15:04.964
An Ohio cadet named Tully McRae
wrote to his sweetheart--this is

00:15:04.964 --> 00:15:09.968
April 1861: "This has been an
eventful week in the history of

00:15:09.968 --> 00:15:13.011
West Point.
There has been such a stampede

00:15:13.011 --> 00:15:15.220
of cadets as was never known
before.

00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:19.201
Thirty-two resigned and were
relieved from duty on Monday,

00:15:19.201 --> 00:15:23.462
April 22, and since then enough
to increase the number to more

00:15:23.462 --> 00:15:27.356
than forty.
There are now few cadets from

00:15:27.356 --> 00:15:32.360
any southern state left here."
In all, seventy-four southern

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:36.012
cadets resigned and were
dismissed for refusing to take

00:15:36.012 --> 00:15:39.190
the Oath of Allegiance to the
United States;

00:15:39.190 --> 00:15:44.128
but twenty-one southern cadets,
from slave states,

00:15:44.128 --> 00:15:49.370
remained and would eventually
fight for the Union.

00:15:49.370 --> 00:15:54.768
This was a far higher
proportion of loyalist than

00:15:54.768 --> 00:16:00.279
southern students at Harvard,
Yale or Columbia.

00:16:00.279 --> 00:16:04.720
At Princeton not one southern
student remained at the

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:09.161
college--it's an old southern
tradition at Princeton,

00:16:09.161 --> 00:16:13.248
make no mistake.
There are many extraordinary

00:16:13.248 --> 00:16:16.900
witnesses to these breakups at
West Point.

00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:23.479
Here's just one of them.
The cadet, George Armstrong

00:16:23.479 --> 00:16:28.144
Custer, Class of 1861--that
Custer--recalled walking

00:16:28.144 --> 00:16:33.266
sentinel duty in June of '61 and
seeing fifteen defecting

00:16:33.266 --> 00:16:38.479
southern cadets marching toward
a steamboat landing on the

00:16:38.479 --> 00:16:40.726
Hudson.
I quote him:

00:16:40.726 --> 00:16:45.234
"Too far off to exchange verbal
'adieu,' even if military

00:16:45.234 --> 00:16:50.064
discipline had permitted it,
they caught sight of me as step

00:16:50.064 --> 00:16:53.754
by step I reluctantly paid the
penalty of offended

00:16:53.754 --> 00:16:57.972
regulations"--that's why he's
doing this guard duty--"and

00:16:57.972 --> 00:17:01.059
raised their hats in token
farewell,

00:17:01.059 --> 00:17:05.722
to which, first casting my eyes
about to see that no watchful

00:17:05.722 --> 00:17:10.267
superior was in view,
I responded by bringing my

00:17:10.267 --> 00:17:12.600
musket to a present."

00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:24.371
Custer would later be proud of
how many southerners he had

00:17:24.371 --> 00:17:28.080
killed.
Now, the next whole section of

00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:33.824
this course I want to suggest
some questions that we want to

00:17:33.824 --> 00:17:38.009
hope that we leave you with
answers for;

00:17:38.009 --> 00:17:39.236
and you can write these down
and hold me to it,

00:17:39.236 --> 00:17:41.129
if you want.
We can disagree about those

00:17:41.129 --> 00:17:44.000
answers, but that's what
history's ultimately for.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:49.760
(1) Why did the North win this
war?

00:17:49.760 --> 00:18:00.308
(2) Why did the South lose it?
(3) What did making war,

00:18:00.308 --> 00:18:06.685
and experiencing it,
mean to common soldiers,

00:18:06.685 --> 00:18:10.091
to officers,
to their families,

00:18:10.091 --> 00:18:14.400
to the women left at home and
the women who went to the front?

00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:24.501
(4) How did the war unleash or
reinforce or reshape nineteenth

00:18:24.501 --> 00:18:30.331
century values and attitudes?
When Americans of the 1860s

00:18:30.331 --> 00:18:35.021
confronted war on this scale,
eighty percent of all white

00:18:35.021 --> 00:18:39.795
males in the American South
between the age of sixteen and

00:18:39.795 --> 00:18:44.150
forty-five will be in the
army--eighty percent.

00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:48.243
In the northern states,
fifty percent--a much higher

00:18:48.243 --> 00:18:53.140
population--of all white males
between eighteen and forty-five

00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:58.486
will be in the Army or the Navy.
Can you imagine if we had fifty

00:18:58.486 --> 00:19:03.241
percent of the American--let's
just count the white males--in

00:19:03.241 --> 00:19:07.599
the United States today under
arms, through a draft?

00:19:07.599 --> 00:19:11.940
A whole lot of you wouldn't be
here.

00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:15.769
(5) What did the war itself
mean on both sides?

00:19:15.769 --> 00:19:22.623
Its cause, its purpose,
that developing sense of the

00:19:22.623 --> 00:19:27.470
reason people fight.
What was it about?

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:37.509
(6) What were the war's
results, what were its

00:19:37.509 --> 00:19:42.362
consequences?
Do wars have meanings that we

00:19:42.362 --> 00:19:50.010
are obliged to discern?
Yes.

00:19:50.010 --> 00:19:58.315
(7) Why were the slaves freed?
How did emancipation come,

00:19:58.315 --> 00:20:01.599
when it came,
the way it came?

00:20:01.599 --> 00:20:06.786
(8) Was the American Civil War
a second American

00:20:06.786 --> 00:20:11.200
Revolution--yes,
no, maybe in between?

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:16.019
Is it the wrong term,
is there a better one?

00:20:16.019 --> 00:20:24.923
(9) What is the place of this
pivotal, transformative event in

00:20:24.923 --> 00:20:32.335
America's national memory?
And (10)--God I hope we can

00:20:32.335 --> 00:20:38.740
answer some of these--was the
Civil War a just war?

00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:46.156
Okay, when the war came--back
to that little picture of Bull

00:20:46.156 --> 00:20:51.309
Run in a moment--but when the
war came,

00:20:51.309 --> 00:21:02.910
of course, Americans had to now
decide how to fight a war.

00:21:02.910 --> 00:21:05.355
They had never mobilized
for--like they're going to

00:21:05.355 --> 00:21:08.607
mobilize in this war;
although at the beginning no

00:21:08.607 --> 00:21:13.016
one really had any clue of the
scale of the mobilization in

00:21:13.016 --> 00:21:17.044
industry and resources and
transportation and in human

00:21:17.044 --> 00:21:22.270
power that the war would bring.
Let's examine just for a moment

00:21:22.270 --> 00:21:25.885
this question of Union
advantages and Southern

00:21:25.885 --> 00:21:28.523
advantages,
strengths and weaknesses on

00:21:28.523 --> 00:21:31.829
both sides, at the outset of the
war, and even through it.

00:21:31.829 --> 00:21:35.157
It has a great deal to do with
ultimately explaining Union

00:21:35.157 --> 00:21:38.776
victory and Confederate defeat,
although it is not by itself an

00:21:38.776 --> 00:21:41.420
explanation;
the North didn't just win the

00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:43.955
war because it had more
industrial capacity,

00:21:43.955 --> 00:21:47.375
or as Ken Burns has Shelby
Foote say at one point--the star

00:21:47.375 --> 00:21:51.150
of his film--has Shelby Foote
say at one point in the film,

00:21:51.150 --> 00:21:54.500
"The North fought that war with
one hand behind its back."

00:21:58.009 --> 00:22:00.529
Bullshit Shelby,
they really did not fight that

00:22:00.529 --> 00:22:02.609
war with one hand behind their
back.

00:22:02.609 --> 00:22:05.289
[Laughter]
But it helps make a nice

00:22:05.289 --> 00:22:09.623
explanation, or the beginnings
of a nice explanation for

00:22:09.623 --> 00:22:12.180
southern defeat.
There were many Union

00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:15.650
advantages.
Let me just tick off several.

00:22:15.650 --> 00:22:19.166
First in finances,
the North had--most of this in

00:22:19.166 --> 00:22:23.636
New York City and a couple of
other cities--had four times the

00:22:23.636 --> 00:22:26.640
bank deposits as the southern
states,

00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:30.194
even though most of the
southern states had their bank

00:22:30.194 --> 00:22:33.802
deposits in northern banks.
In manufacturing,

00:22:33.802 --> 00:22:38.596
there were 110,000
manufacturing establishments in

00:22:38.596 --> 00:22:44.171
the northern states with 1.2
million industrial workers in

00:22:44.171 --> 00:22:48.315
1860.
The North had four times--oh I

00:22:48.315 --> 00:22:52.113
already said that,
the bank deposits,

00:22:52.113 --> 00:22:56.687
forgive me.
The North--excuse me--there

00:22:56.687 --> 00:23:03.456
were as many factories in the
North as there were industrial

00:23:03.456 --> 00:23:08.635
workers in the South;
in the neighborhood of 100,000

00:23:08.635 --> 00:23:13.083
or so small manufacturing
industrial workers of one kind

00:23:13.083 --> 00:23:16.559
and another in southern towns
and cites;

00:23:16.559 --> 00:23:19.539
the northern states had that
many manufacturing

00:23:19.539 --> 00:23:22.542
establishments.
Eighty percent of all

00:23:22.542 --> 00:23:27.614
industrial capacity in the
United States were in the free

00:23:27.614 --> 00:23:31.129
states.
One Connecticut county,

00:23:31.129 --> 00:23:37.030
New Haven County--this town,
and its county--produced

00:23:37.030 --> 00:23:43.725
firearms valued at ten times the
entire southern capacity to

00:23:43.725 --> 00:23:48.864
produce firearms in 1860.
Now the South's going to

00:23:48.864 --> 00:23:52.623
improve that greatly through the
Tredegar Iron Works,

00:23:52.623 --> 00:23:56.019
in Richmond in particular,
and other places.

00:23:56.019 --> 00:23:58.637
But New Haven,
Connecticut produced ten times

00:23:58.637 --> 00:24:01.970
the firearms as the entire South
put together in 1860.

00:24:01.970 --> 00:24:05.098
Those shells of some of those
old factories in this town,

00:24:05.098 --> 00:24:08.100
that are no longer factories,
were gun factories,

00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:11.310
and man did they get rich
during the Civil War.

00:24:15.039 --> 00:24:17.447
In transportation,
eighty percent of all railroad

00:24:17.447 --> 00:24:20.055
miles in the United States,
the former United States,

00:24:20.055 --> 00:24:24.968
were in the northern states.
Of the 470 locomotives made in

00:24:24.968 --> 00:24:31.144
the United States by 1860,
only nineteen of them had been

00:24:31.144 --> 00:24:35.435
made in the South.
The North had the vast,

00:24:35.435 --> 00:24:39.473
vast majority of skilled
mechanics who worked on

00:24:39.473 --> 00:24:42.185
railroads.
The North tended to have

00:24:42.185 --> 00:24:45.643
uniform gauges to their
railroads, three or four feet

00:24:45.643 --> 00:24:48.705
wide to the track.
In the South they had this

00:24:48.705 --> 00:24:51.588
ridiculous problem,
frankly, and they will not

00:24:51.588 --> 00:24:54.301
solve it very quickly,
that the South built its

00:24:54.301 --> 00:24:56.523
railroads haphazardly,
state by state by state by

00:24:56.523 --> 00:24:58.122
state,
at all kinds of different

00:24:58.122 --> 00:25:00.630
gauges, three and a half feet
here, four feet there,

00:25:00.630 --> 00:25:03.223
four and a half feet there.
You'd go into one town with a

00:25:03.223 --> 00:25:06.069
railroad gauge that's one width
but it goes out the other side

00:25:06.069 --> 00:25:08.170
of town with a gauge that's
another width.

00:25:08.170 --> 00:25:12.526
You had to switch locomotives
and switch trains,

00:25:12.526 --> 00:25:17.610
as ridiculous as that sounds.
They found out in a hurry what

00:25:17.610 --> 00:25:21.403
a misery that would cause.
Another northern advantage was

00:25:21.403 --> 00:25:24.829
simply in manpower--just look at
the population numbers.

00:25:24.829 --> 00:25:29.435
The population of the North was
approximately twenty-two and a

00:25:29.435 --> 00:25:34.750
half million people in 1860.
The population of the South was

00:25:34.750 --> 00:25:41.048
slightly over nine million white
people and about four and a half

00:25:41.048 --> 00:25:45.210
million black people;
about 4.2 million of whom were

00:25:45.210 --> 00:25:47.692
slaves;
the other 250 to 300,000 who

00:25:47.692 --> 00:25:48.980
were free blacks.

00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:58.364
The northern states produced
ninety-four of all cloth in the

00:25:58.364 --> 00:26:01.674
United States in 1860,
ninety-three percent of all pig

00:26:01.674 --> 00:26:04.497
iron, and on and on and on;
boats, ships,

00:26:04.497 --> 00:26:07.638
it's all eighty,
ninety, ninety-five percent in

00:26:07.638 --> 00:26:11.158
favor of the North.
William Tecumseh Sherman was

00:26:11.158 --> 00:26:14.763
sitting in New Orleans,
where he was stationed when

00:26:14.763 --> 00:26:18.243
secession occurred,
and the war broke out in April

00:26:18.243 --> 00:26:22.029
1861, and according to his
testimony he said to his friend,

00:26:22.029 --> 00:26:24.179
who had actually been a West
Point buddy of his,

00:26:24.179 --> 00:26:27.387
he warned him and he said,
quote, "No nation of

00:26:27.387 --> 00:26:32.977
agriculturalists ever made war
on a nation of mechanics and

00:26:32.977 --> 00:26:36.416
survived."
Yes, it's very prescient,

00:26:36.416 --> 00:26:41.312
but I don't want you to think
that Confederate success or

00:26:41.312 --> 00:26:45.509
victory was somehow determined
at the outset,

00:26:45.509 --> 00:26:51.143
because of all these economic,
financial, industrial

00:26:51.143 --> 00:26:54.915
advantages.
The North had certain political

00:26:54.915 --> 00:26:57.613
advantages.
It did not have to create a

00:26:57.613 --> 00:26:59.729
government;
it already had one,

00:26:59.729 --> 00:27:02.019
it had a functioning
government.

00:27:02.019 --> 00:27:04.997
Now eleven of those states are
no longer going to be

00:27:04.997 --> 00:27:08.675
represented, they're going to be
gone, but there's a functioning

00:27:08.675 --> 00:27:10.309
U.S.
Federal Government.

00:27:10.309 --> 00:27:14.486
The South has to create that
government overnight and it has

00:27:14.486 --> 00:27:18.946
to create it out of a political
culture rooted in states' rights

00:27:18.946 --> 00:27:21.884
and localism.
And furthermore--and I think

00:27:21.884 --> 00:27:24.735
this is a very important
point--the North had a

00:27:24.735 --> 00:27:27.089
functioning political party
system.

00:27:27.089 --> 00:27:30.281
There were still functioning
Democrats in the North,

00:27:30.281 --> 00:27:33.160
very strong in certain pockets
of the North.

00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:35.920
They will be a genuine
opposition party to Lincoln's

00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:39.203
Republicans during the war.
They will make a comeback in

00:27:39.203 --> 00:27:45.799
the Congress in 1862;
they got clobbered in 1860.

00:27:45.799 --> 00:27:49.079
The South doesn't have a party
system;

00:27:49.079 --> 00:27:53.210
the South has a one-party
system--they appointed Jefferson

00:27:53.210 --> 00:27:55.721
Davis.
The South will not hold a

00:27:55.721 --> 00:27:59.892
general election for its
presidency and vice-presidency

00:27:59.892 --> 00:28:03.119
during this war.
Why is that important?

00:28:03.119 --> 00:28:05.557
Well, when you have a
functioning political party

00:28:05.557 --> 00:28:08.350
system you have a way of
organizing power and organizing

00:28:08.350 --> 00:28:10.230
patronage and organizing
loyalty.

00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:16.571
We'll see this soon, Thursday.
One of Jefferson Davis's

00:28:16.571 --> 00:28:20.661
greatest problems and biggest
crises throughout the war is

00:28:20.661 --> 00:28:24.750
trying to get the southern
states to go along with various

00:28:24.750 --> 00:28:30.537
Confederate federal policies,
and in the end he will fail at

00:28:30.537 --> 00:28:33.678
much of that.
Now, the South was not without

00:28:33.678 --> 00:28:36.880
advantages.
Look at the map.

00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:40.482
You could argue that the South
had a great advantage of

00:28:40.482 --> 00:28:45.530
geography, if they used it well.
The South is a huge expansive

00:28:45.530 --> 00:28:49.118
territory, huge;
thousands of--what is it,

00:28:49.118 --> 00:28:53.896
almost a 2,000 mile coastline,
1,500 mile coastline I believe,

00:28:53.896 --> 00:28:57.970
if you add up Florida all the
way up to Virginia.

00:28:57.970 --> 00:29:02.540
And when Lincoln announced the
call for 75,000 volunteers in

00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:05.483
April of '61,
he also announced a naval

00:29:05.483 --> 00:29:09.656
blockade of the entire South.
Now this will forever be a

00:29:09.656 --> 00:29:12.826
tricky legal story and an
interesting constitutional

00:29:12.826 --> 00:29:14.634
problem.
Lincoln says the southern

00:29:14.634 --> 00:29:16.795
states could not
constitutionally secede from the

00:29:16.795 --> 00:29:19.654
Union;
they were not therefore a

00:29:19.654 --> 00:29:23.412
legitimate belligerent.
He was not in any way

00:29:23.412 --> 00:29:26.617
recognizing them as a legitimate
government, but,

00:29:26.617 --> 00:29:30.566
oh, by the way,
he was going to put a total

00:29:30.566 --> 00:29:34.329
naval blockade on them
nevertheless.

00:29:34.329 --> 00:29:36.388
Now, foreign countries,
especially Great Britain,

00:29:36.388 --> 00:29:38.809
will look at this and say,
"well you may not--secession

00:29:38.809 --> 00:29:40.987
you may not think is
constitutional in your country

00:29:40.987 --> 00:29:43.339
and you may not call the
confederacy a belligerent,

00:29:43.339 --> 00:29:47.009
but you sure as hell are
treating them like one."

00:29:47.009 --> 00:29:49.674
At any rate,
a blockade around that entire

00:29:49.674 --> 00:29:53.524
coastline will never be easy.
And we know that it was very

00:29:53.524 --> 00:29:56.996
porous in the first year,
even into the second year of

00:29:56.996 --> 00:29:59.420
the war, through 1862 very
porous.

00:29:59.420 --> 00:30:03.982
But the naval blockade
eventually was relatively

00:30:03.982 --> 00:30:08.059
successful, by 1864 and into
early 1865.

00:30:08.059 --> 00:30:12.259
But it's a huge expansive
territory.

00:30:12.259 --> 00:30:17.636
The South had rivers it could
use, and it will use them

00:30:17.636 --> 00:30:20.450
effectively;
of course so will the North,

00:30:20.450 --> 00:30:24.559
once they invade the South.
Geography was an advantage to

00:30:24.559 --> 00:30:28.824
the southern cause,
as many military historians

00:30:28.824 --> 00:30:33.739
have argued ever since,
if and when they stayed on the

00:30:33.739 --> 00:30:36.847
defensive.
When they chose to invade the

00:30:36.847 --> 00:30:39.750
North, as Lee will twice,
two fateful invasions,

00:30:39.750 --> 00:30:44.356
the one resulting at Antietam
in September of '62 and the

00:30:44.356 --> 00:30:47.400
other at Gettysburg in July of
'63,

00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:51.283
he was giving up that advantage
of the defensive position,

00:30:51.283 --> 00:30:55.166
forcing the larger armies of
the North to come to them and

00:30:55.166 --> 00:30:59.240
attack on southern ground,
on southern soil.

00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:04.861
This has always been a
debate--had the South remained

00:31:04.861 --> 00:31:11.347
utterly defensive in this war,
could the North have stood it,

00:31:11.347 --> 00:31:15.387
held out long enough?
Thirdly, you could argue that

00:31:15.387 --> 00:31:17.970
the South has an advantage in
its cause or its purpose.

00:31:17.970 --> 00:31:21.960
And perhaps at first maybe they
did, or even later,

00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:26.269
after a terrible degree of war
weariness had set in.

00:31:26.269 --> 00:31:29.072
The argument is simply that the
South didn't have to win the

00:31:29.072 --> 00:31:31.210
war, they didn't have to conquer
the North,

00:31:31.210 --> 00:31:36.009
they simply had to fight long
enough as an insurgent.

00:31:36.009 --> 00:31:38.910
They were the insurgent,
the Confederacy was an

00:31:38.910 --> 00:31:43.009
insurgency, let's use that term,
that's exactly what they were.

00:31:43.009 --> 00:31:46.388
If they could hold out long
enough and force the North into

00:31:46.388 --> 00:31:50.236
a degree of war weariness,
into some kind of economic

00:31:50.236 --> 00:31:53.559
trauma, they might just sue for
peace.

00:31:53.559 --> 00:31:59.844
After all, the goal of the
Confederacy was national

00:31:59.844 --> 00:32:03.518
independence.
Some have said their cause was

00:32:03.518 --> 00:32:07.260
clearer, less abstract;
defense of the homeland,

00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:11.786
defense of hearth,
is in some ways less abstract

00:32:11.786 --> 00:32:17.370
than defense of the Union or the
Constitution or the social

00:32:17.370 --> 00:32:20.479
order.
How many of you want your sons

00:32:20.479 --> 00:32:24.240
to die for the social order?
Well maybe you do,

00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:27.843
not for me to say.
If they had stayed on the

00:32:27.843 --> 00:32:32.099
defensive--and they know this;
this is one of those testy

00:32:32.099 --> 00:32:35.359
questions about Robert E.
Lee's legacy.

00:32:35.359 --> 00:32:38.888
They had an advantage here now
of this new, relatively new

00:32:38.888 --> 00:32:42.106
invention--thousands upon
thousands upon thousands of

00:32:42.106 --> 00:32:45.325
which were made in this
town--and that was the rifled

00:32:45.325 --> 00:32:48.958
musket.
Until the late 1840s and into

00:32:48.958 --> 00:32:54.809
the 1850s almost all firearms,
all muskets were smoothbore.

00:32:54.809 --> 00:32:59.065
The shell or the bullet or the
minie ball that came out of

00:32:59.065 --> 00:33:03.021
them, came out of a just a
barrel that was flat on the

00:33:03.021 --> 00:33:06.680
inside and it would only go 100
to 200 yards;

00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:10.034
200 yards maximum.
But with the creation of the

00:33:10.034 --> 00:33:13.814
rifled musket--and eventually
rifled cannon--a rifled musket

00:33:13.814 --> 00:33:16.890
could hit something as far as
800 years away;

00:33:16.890 --> 00:33:20.761
it didn't mean you could see
what you were shooting at,

00:33:20.761 --> 00:33:24.490
but it was extremely deadly at
2 to 300 yards now,

00:33:24.490 --> 00:33:28.024
in a war that's still going to
be fought with these hideous old

00:33:28.024 --> 00:33:31.160
Napoleonic tactics of lining up
men by the thousands,

00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:35.554
arm to arm, elbow to elbow,
and simply moving across

00:33:35.554 --> 00:33:39.483
fields.
The defensive position with the

00:33:39.483 --> 00:33:44.059
rifled musket was a huge
advantage, if used.

00:33:44.059 --> 00:33:47.316
Many have said over and over
that the South had superior

00:33:47.316 --> 00:33:50.809
generalship in the first
especially two years of the war,

00:33:50.809 --> 00:33:53.859
and I don't think there's much
question that they did.

00:33:53.859 --> 00:34:00.876
And then of course some have
argued that the South simply had

00:34:00.876 --> 00:34:06.372
the yeoman soldier--better
soldiers, better men,

00:34:06.372 --> 00:34:09.823
so-called.
Now they thought they did,

00:34:09.823 --> 00:34:13.659
and let me give you a couple of
illustrations of that.

00:34:13.659 --> 00:34:18.961
They thought they did,
in their rhetoric and in their

00:34:18.961 --> 00:34:21.000
war fever of 1861.

00:34:32.980 --> 00:34:36.433
One young Confederate officer
wrote home from the summer of

00:34:36.433 --> 00:34:39.170
1861.
He said, "Just throw three or

00:34:39.170 --> 00:34:43.570
four shells among those
blue-bellied Yankees and they'll

00:34:43.570 --> 00:34:48.579
scatter like sheep."
So was the theory.

00:34:48.579 --> 00:34:52.839
"It was not the improved arm
but the improved man," wrote

00:34:52.839 --> 00:34:57.480
Governor Henry Wise of Virginia,
"which would win the day."

00:34:57.480 --> 00:35:01.327
He's writing this in 1861.
"Let brave men advance with

00:35:01.327 --> 00:35:05.079
flint locks and old-fashioned
bayonets on the popinjays of

00:35:05.079 --> 00:35:09.030
Northern cities and he would
answer for it with his life.

00:35:09.030 --> 00:35:14.510
The Yankees," he says,
"will break and run."

00:35:14.510 --> 00:35:17.890
The Yankees won't fight,
or so was the theory.

00:35:22.010 --> 00:35:24.010
Now, I don't know,
at times I suppose there was an

00:35:24.010 --> 00:35:26.985
advantage.
There was a certain warrior

00:35:26.985 --> 00:35:30.513
culture in the South.
There were perhaps more hunters

00:35:30.513 --> 00:35:32.890
per capita in the South than
maybe in the North;

00:35:32.890 --> 00:35:38.593
but don't make much of that one.
The South had awesome problems

00:35:38.593 --> 00:35:41.733
though to fight this war as
well, and let me tick them off

00:35:41.733 --> 00:35:44.957
quickly.
They'll have a tremendous

00:35:44.957 --> 00:35:49.460
problem of supply,
as the war gets bigger.

00:35:49.460 --> 00:35:54.340
Johnny Reb will never be very
well clad, never very well fed.

00:35:54.340 --> 00:36:00.320
Always reliant on captured
blankets and captured boots and

00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:04.411
captured food,
and even captured medical

00:36:04.411 --> 00:36:09.427
supplies at times.
In the South they will truly,

00:36:09.427 --> 00:36:14.096
in a biblical sense,
have to make ploughshares into

00:36:14.096 --> 00:36:17.357
swords.
They actually accomplished

00:36:17.357 --> 00:36:22.280
amazing things in the creation
of weapons, of ordinance,

00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:26.040
of gun powder,
of shells, by the thousands,

00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:29.496
almost overnight.
They will also buy a lot from

00:36:29.496 --> 00:36:31.803
Great Britain,
from the French to some extent,

00:36:31.803 --> 00:36:34.623
and much of that will get in
through the blockade in the

00:36:34.623 --> 00:36:37.516
first two years.
They had a huge disadvantage of

00:36:37.516 --> 00:36:40.275
not having a Navy.
They had to somehow create a

00:36:40.275 --> 00:36:43.682
Navy--and we'll come back to
this later when we look at the

00:36:43.682 --> 00:36:49.199
role of Europe in this.
They will go to Britain and try

00:36:49.199 --> 00:36:54.090
to buy ships,
and they will--ironclads,

00:36:54.090 --> 00:36:56.461
rams,
and, ultimately,

00:36:56.461 --> 00:37:00.066
battleships,
that will prey upon and destroy

00:37:00.066 --> 00:37:02.330
hundreds of Union ships.

00:37:06.010 --> 00:37:09.724
And then you might say that
they had a real political

00:37:09.724 --> 00:37:13.652
disadvantage--I guess I've
already mentioned it--in that

00:37:13.652 --> 00:37:17.010
they were born of a states'
rights impulse,

00:37:17.010 --> 00:37:20.893
and overnight now they have to
try to centralize a government,

00:37:20.893 --> 00:37:26.485
to fight a highly centralized,
coordinated war over a vast

00:37:26.485 --> 00:37:30.756
thousand mile front.
And Georgians are supposed to

00:37:30.756 --> 00:37:33.822
cooperate with Virginians who
are supposed to cooperate with

00:37:33.822 --> 00:37:36.940
Tennesseans who are supposed to
cooperate with Arkansans.

00:37:36.940 --> 00:37:42.687
And it didn't always work.
And last but not least,

00:37:42.687 --> 00:37:49.150
would slavery be an advantage
or a disadvantage in the South's

00:37:49.150 --> 00:37:52.780
war efforts?
To some degree it was an

00:37:52.780 --> 00:37:57.628
advantage, and thousands upon
thousands of American slaves

00:37:57.628 --> 00:38:02.050
will be put to work for the
Confederate military,

00:38:02.050 --> 00:38:06.952
for the Confederate industry.
If you visited a Confederate

00:38:06.952 --> 00:38:10.733
army from 1861 on,
if it was above 1000 men,

00:38:10.733 --> 00:38:16.010
you would see plenty of black
guys, and some black women.

00:38:16.010 --> 00:38:19.040
If you were on a southern train
by 1863, you'd see plenty of

00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:21.659
black workers on that train,
most of them slaves.

00:38:21.659 --> 00:38:25.573
If you were in a field hospital
in Georgia by '63 and '64,

00:38:25.573 --> 00:38:28.883
during Sherman's March,
if you were in a Confederate

00:38:28.883 --> 00:38:31.329
hospital you'd see plenty of
black nurses;

00:38:31.329 --> 00:38:36.331
about forty percent of all the
nurses in Confederate hospitals,

00:38:36.331 --> 00:38:39.800
from '63 on,
in Georgia were slave women.

00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:45.864
They were impressed into
Confederate service by the

00:38:45.864 --> 00:38:49.130
thousands.
So there's an advantage in that.

00:38:49.130 --> 00:38:54.842
But I think as we'll see next
week, slavery ultimately was the

00:38:54.842 --> 00:38:59.150
Achilles heel of the Confederate
war effort,

00:38:59.150 --> 00:39:02.158
because once the Union
leadership--and that's going to

00:39:02.158 --> 00:39:04.940
happen, it's going to take a
year into the war,

00:39:04.940 --> 00:39:09.281
but that's going to happen by
1862, and certainly '63--will

00:39:09.281 --> 00:39:13.848
come to see that the only way
they can truly win the war is by

00:39:13.848 --> 00:39:17.964
destroying slavery.
And once the Union war effort

00:39:17.964 --> 00:39:23.250
becomes an effort to destroy the
social structure of the South,

00:39:23.250 --> 00:39:29.114
including its labor system,
and an effort to destroy

00:39:29.114 --> 00:39:35.900
slavery, it becomes an all-out
and total war of conquest.

00:39:35.900 --> 00:39:40.170
Now, quickly,
to the extent there was an

00:39:40.170 --> 00:39:44.988
opening grand strategy,
soon to be abandoned,

00:39:44.988 --> 00:39:47.632
it was this.
Winfield Scott,

00:39:47.632 --> 00:39:50.131
the "Old Rough and Ready," as
he was known,

00:39:50.131 --> 00:39:53.940
the old General of the Mexican
War--he's very ancient by now,

00:39:53.940 --> 00:39:57.093
he's eighty-years-old,
he's big and he's fat and he's

00:39:57.093 --> 00:40:00.914
immobile--but he was the General
of the Army and he came up with

00:40:00.914 --> 00:40:03.280
what he called the "Anaconda
Plan."

00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:07.784
The Anaconda Plan was basically
to envelop the South,

00:40:07.784 --> 00:40:10.730
surround it by a naval
blockade,

00:40:10.730 --> 00:40:15.087
use gunboats to penetrate the
rivers down the Ohio,

00:40:15.087 --> 00:40:19.010
the Mississippi,
the Missouri if necessary,

00:40:19.010 --> 00:40:21.650
from the west,
and up those rivers of Virginia

00:40:21.650 --> 00:40:23.880
and down the coast of the
Carolinas,

00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:28.995
and, in effect,
suffocate the South from

00:40:28.995 --> 00:40:33.648
outside, over time.
It might take a year,

00:40:33.648 --> 00:40:39.192
it might even take two years.
The idea here was to surround

00:40:39.192 --> 00:40:44.760
the South and to force them
ultimately to not just see the

00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:51.110
error of their ways but to see
that they had no chance to win.

00:40:51.110 --> 00:40:56.047
This was a plan now that would
not invade the South with major

00:40:56.047 --> 00:40:59.769
armies and seek major
battlefield victories,

00:40:59.769 --> 00:41:04.909
it was almost a kind of an
economic plan to win a war.

00:41:04.909 --> 00:41:08.609
It would take time,
patience and an ever-growing

00:41:08.609 --> 00:41:11.022
Navy.
But the American people

00:41:11.022 --> 00:41:14.129
wouldn't have it.
The northern people wouldn't

00:41:14.129 --> 00:41:15.861
have it.
They wanted an army forming

00:41:15.861 --> 00:41:16.929
around Washington,
D.C.

00:41:16.929 --> 00:41:19.897
in April, May,
and June, 1861,

00:41:19.897 --> 00:41:22.278
to move, to act.
Horace Greeley,

00:41:22.278 --> 00:41:24.396
the most important editor of
the most important newspaper in

00:41:24.396 --> 00:41:25.776
the United States,
the New York

00:41:25.776 --> 00:41:27.070
Herald-Tribune,
in New York,

00:41:27.070 --> 00:41:31.568
published that famous headline,
"On To Richmond"--or "Forward

00:41:31.568 --> 00:41:36.067
to Richmond," it said.
Attack that Confederate army,

00:41:36.067 --> 00:41:38.550
stop the insurgency,
whip them once,

00:41:38.550 --> 00:41:42.488
end the rebellion,
punish its leaders and get this

00:41:42.488 --> 00:41:45.410
thing over before the end of
summer.

00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:53.001
Now, the problem here is not
unlike--think about it--the

00:41:53.001 --> 00:41:55.719
problem in the American
Revolution.

00:41:55.719 --> 00:42:00.593
If the British could've ended
that American insurgency in the

00:42:00.593 --> 00:42:03.988
American Revolution quickly,
in the first year or two,

00:42:03.988 --> 00:42:05.982
instead of letting these
American armies under George

00:42:05.982 --> 00:42:08.130
Washington and others keep
retreating away from them,

00:42:08.130 --> 00:42:11.178
and not engaging in any real
pitched battles,

00:42:11.178 --> 00:42:14.019
and continuing to give up their
cities,

00:42:14.019 --> 00:42:17.580
and retreat inland and inland
and inland, the Americans would

00:42:17.580 --> 00:42:19.480
not have won their revolution.

00:42:25.030 --> 00:42:29.328
As long as the Confederate
armies could exist,

00:42:29.328 --> 00:42:34.869
the Confederacy could exist,
if indeed we interpret it as a

00:42:34.869 --> 00:42:39.324
revolutionary insurgency;
and, ultimately,

00:42:39.324 --> 00:42:45.010
that is virtually how they will
interpret themselves.

00:42:45.010 --> 00:42:49.690
And, hence, we can see that if
this war lasts very long,

00:42:49.690 --> 00:42:53.010
if it lasted frankly beyond one
year,

00:42:53.010 --> 00:42:58.064
it had all the potential of
becoming a war of conquest,

00:42:58.064 --> 00:43:02.369
all out and total,
requiring the destruction of

00:43:02.369 --> 00:43:07.329
the southern infrastructure and
southern society.

00:43:07.329 --> 00:43:12.928
Now, both sides in this
war--and I'll get around to Bull

00:43:12.928 --> 00:43:17.916
Run and the way the war broke
out in the west in a

00:43:17.916 --> 00:43:24.329
moment--both sides in this war
will engage in conscription,

00:43:24.329 --> 00:43:29.666
they will create the draft for
the first time in American

00:43:29.666 --> 00:43:33.790
history.
The Confederates were first to

00:43:33.790 --> 00:43:36.166
do it.
The first Conscription Act in

00:43:36.166 --> 00:43:39.609
American history is passed in
April of 1862 by the Confederate

00:43:39.609 --> 00:43:42.320
Government.
It said that all able-bodied

00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:46.093
men eighteen to thirty-five,
later raised to forty-five,

00:43:46.093 --> 00:43:49.659
would be conscripted into three
years of service.

00:43:49.659 --> 00:43:54.134
They allowed the hiring of a
substitute, which led to the

00:43:54.134 --> 00:43:57.329
charge of elitism,
which was accurate.

00:43:57.329 --> 00:44:01.659
There were brokers and all
kinds of dishonest substitutes.

00:44:01.659 --> 00:44:06.681
One man is alleged to have sold
himself twenty times for the

00:44:06.681 --> 00:44:09.829
bounty that he got paid to get
out.

00:44:09.829 --> 00:44:14.359
There were exemptions in the
Confederate conscription--public

00:44:14.359 --> 00:44:16.725
servants, ministers,
teachers, editors,

00:44:16.725 --> 00:44:18.451
nurses, factory and railroad
workers, miners,

00:44:18.451 --> 00:44:21.839
and telegraph operators.
Among the Confederate troops

00:44:21.839 --> 00:44:26.248
out at the front they called
these people "bomb-proof"

00:44:26.248 --> 00:44:28.802
positions.
And then, worst of all,

00:44:28.802 --> 00:44:32.641
in the Confederate Conscription
Law in 1863, they passed what

00:44:32.641 --> 00:44:36.545
was known as the Twenty Negro
Law: if you owned twenty or more

00:44:36.545 --> 00:44:39.170
slaves you were exempt from
service.

00:44:39.170 --> 00:44:42.487
The reason for that was the
deep fear setting in,

00:44:42.487 --> 00:44:45.804
in 1862 across the South,
that if all these white

00:44:45.804 --> 00:44:49.743
men--eighty percent of white
males in the South will be in

00:44:49.743 --> 00:44:53.821
the Army--and if all these white
men left the plantations it

00:44:53.821 --> 00:44:58.590
would be black men left on the
plantations running the place.

00:44:58.590 --> 00:45:02.444
Any man who had twenty or more
slaves was exempt,

00:45:02.444 --> 00:45:05.909
if he chose to be.
This will cause tremendous

00:45:05.909 --> 00:45:10.273
resentment in the Confederate
armies and ultimately become one

00:45:10.273 --> 00:45:15.028
of the causes of desertion.
The Union Conscription Law came

00:45:15.028 --> 00:45:18.309
later, it didn't come until
early '63.

00:45:18.309 --> 00:45:21.718
It drafted every able-bodied
man twenty years of age to

00:45:21.718 --> 00:45:25.737
forty-five years of age.
It had--its exemptions were

00:45:25.737 --> 00:45:30.621
more limited.
You could escape if you could

00:45:30.621 --> 00:45:35.993
find a substitute and pay $300;
hence the charge,

00:45:35.993 --> 00:45:38.602
not inaccurate,
that in the North,

00:45:38.602 --> 00:45:42.159
this "people's war," as Lincoln
called it,

00:45:42.159 --> 00:45:47.050
this war to save democracy,
became a rich man's war and a

00:45:47.050 --> 00:45:51.490
poor man's fight.
Generous bounties were paid if

00:45:51.490 --> 00:45:55.383
you enlisted,
and in the end only about six

00:45:55.383 --> 00:46:01.500
percent of all the Union forces
in the Civil War were draftees.

00:46:01.500 --> 00:46:05.741
The social pressure in some
communities, since regiments

00:46:05.741 --> 00:46:08.439
were formed locally,
was tremendous,

00:46:08.439 --> 00:46:11.369
especially in the first two
years.

00:46:11.369 --> 00:46:17.634
Approximately twenty percent of
all Confederates were draftees

00:46:17.634 --> 00:46:21.639
and only six percent of Union
troops.

00:46:21.639 --> 00:46:28.958
Now, I only have a few minutes
left, and I'm sorry for that,

00:46:28.958 --> 00:46:35.159
but I wanted to lay out our
aims and goals here.

00:46:35.159 --> 00:46:38.736
But let me leave you with how
this first battle of the war

00:46:38.736 --> 00:46:40.707
actually came;
and we'll pick it up there

00:46:40.707 --> 00:46:44.610
Thursday;
it makes as much sense Thursday.

00:46:44.610 --> 00:46:48.078
Along that creek--you can see
the picture here,

00:46:48.078 --> 00:46:53.532
an extraordinary photograph,
actually taken in 1862,

00:46:53.532 --> 00:46:59.779
of four children,
two of them wearing what are

00:46:59.779 --> 00:47:08.107
probably Union kepis--hats--and
seven Union cavalrymen across

00:47:08.107 --> 00:47:12.970
the creek,
as though they're at attention

00:47:12.970 --> 00:47:18.635
for the photographer.
It's a remarkable picture of,

00:47:18.635 --> 00:47:23.885
it seems to me,
the influence of war on the

00:47:23.885 --> 00:47:27.359
young.
But it was along that creek on

00:47:27.359 --> 00:47:31.039
the 21^(st) of July,
1861, a Sunday afternoon,

00:47:31.039 --> 00:47:33.268
that the first collision of
amateur armies occurred,

00:47:33.268 --> 00:47:35.760
and the first major battle of
the Civil War came about.

00:47:35.760 --> 00:47:38.358
Lincoln, under the pressure of
public opinion,

00:47:38.358 --> 00:47:40.610
forced his commander,
Irvin McDowell,

00:47:40.610 --> 00:47:43.510
to move this army,
that was not very well trained,

00:47:43.510 --> 00:47:46.410
it wasn't prepared to
fight--they hadn't even been

00:47:46.410 --> 00:47:49.307
taught how to retreat,
which they're about to

00:47:49.307 --> 00:47:52.414
demonstrate.
McDowell complained to Lincoln,

00:47:52.414 --> 00:47:56.949
he said, "These people can't
fight, we haven't learned this,

00:47:56.949 --> 00:47:58.775
we haven't learned that,
we're not ready,

00:47:58.775 --> 00:48:00.564
don't make us move."
And Lincoln said,

00:48:00.564 --> 00:48:02.179
"I have no choice,
you must move."

00:48:02.179 --> 00:48:06.829
And he wrote to McDowell and he
said, quote, "You are green,

00:48:06.829 --> 00:48:12.940
it is true, but they are green.
You are all green alike."

00:48:12.940 --> 00:48:15.089
Well, thanks a lot,
McDowell probably said,

00:48:15.089 --> 00:48:17.852
and off he marched about twenty
miles south and west of

00:48:17.852 --> 00:48:20.974
Washington to collide with this
Confederate army that had been

00:48:20.974 --> 00:48:23.840
forming now for three months in
northern Virginia,

00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:29.739
threatening the U.S. capital.
It was a summer outing.

00:48:29.739 --> 00:48:31.989
A couple of hundred civilians
in carriages,

00:48:31.989 --> 00:48:34.989
many of them congressmen and
their wives and families,

00:48:34.989 --> 00:48:37.242
got in carriages,
packed picnic lunches,

00:48:37.242 --> 00:48:41.920
went down to watch the battle.
They sat on hillsides to watch

00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:45.540
this spectacle;
you stay far enough away you

00:48:45.540 --> 00:48:48.985
wouldn't see any blood.
Oh, there's going to be some

00:48:48.985 --> 00:48:51.730
casualties but that's--there's
supposed to be.

00:48:51.730 --> 00:48:55.190
They took picnics.
Two U.S.

00:48:55.190 --> 00:48:59.255
congressmen wound up captured
and spent the next year in a

00:48:59.255 --> 00:49:03.320
Richmond prison.
It was a crazy battle.

00:49:03.320 --> 00:49:08.156
It lasted only three hours,
and both commanding generals,

00:49:08.156 --> 00:49:13.252
Beauregard on the Confederate
side and McDowell on the Union

00:49:13.252 --> 00:49:15.086
side,
had the same plan,

00:49:15.086 --> 00:49:17.670
a fake to the right and a move
to the left.

00:49:17.670 --> 00:49:21.348
This was old-fashioned stuff.
Now, if they both had managed

00:49:21.348 --> 00:49:23.280
to pull it off and their men had
known what they were doing,

00:49:23.280 --> 00:49:26.815
they'd have simply moved each
other around and the Confederate

00:49:26.815 --> 00:49:29.250
army could've walked up into
Washington.

00:49:29.250 --> 00:49:34.897
But nothing came off as planned.
At first the Union forces took

00:49:34.897 --> 00:49:36.969
several hundred yards of the
field;

00:49:36.969 --> 00:49:40.067
it looked like,
in these field glasses people

00:49:40.067 --> 00:49:44.010
were using, that this was going
to be a Union victory.

00:49:44.010 --> 00:49:45.332
First clash,
a Union victory,

00:49:45.332 --> 00:49:47.882
send the Confederate Army
retreating back into Virginia

00:49:47.882 --> 00:49:50.562
and end the rebellion.
But then as fast as that

00:49:50.562 --> 00:49:53.829
happened it turned around,
and a counter-attack came.

00:49:53.829 --> 00:49:57.373
It was led by a general named
Thomas Jackson,

00:49:57.373 --> 00:50:02.204
who gets his name at Bull Run,
Stonewall Jackson--more on him

00:50:02.204 --> 00:50:04.693
later.
And suddenly these Union

00:50:04.693 --> 00:50:08.691
soldiers--knew nothing of
retreat--they threw down rifles,

00:50:08.691 --> 00:50:13.110
they ran through creeks and
found the first road they could.

00:50:13.110 --> 00:50:16.194
So they broke ranks,
and they retreated,

00:50:16.194 --> 00:50:20.781
many of them running the rest
of that afternoon and through

00:50:20.781 --> 00:50:23.629
into the evening,
back to Washington,

00:50:23.629 --> 00:50:26.909
D.C.
in utter defeat and retreat.

00:50:26.909 --> 00:50:31.660
It was so bad that the wagons
and the caissons of the

00:50:31.660 --> 00:50:35.039
artillery started running over
men.

00:50:35.039 --> 00:50:37.467
Albion Tourgee,
later to become the most

00:50:37.467 --> 00:50:40.890
important novelist and writer of
the Reconstruction era,

00:50:40.890 --> 00:50:44.261
was badly wounded;
he had his shoulder smashed and

00:50:44.261 --> 00:50:48.199
broken by the wheel of a caisson
in the retreat from Bull Run,

00:50:48.199 --> 00:50:51.039
and would have to leave the war
for year;

00:50:51.039 --> 00:50:53.287
he'll return to it,
but he'd never be able to use

00:50:53.287 --> 00:50:55.159
one of his shoulders very
effectively.

00:50:55.159 --> 00:51:02.056
Bull Run--First Bull Run--was a
complete Confederate victory,

00:51:02.056 --> 00:51:05.664
a Union defeat.
The Union Army retreated into

00:51:05.664 --> 00:51:08.289
the national capital,
a shock to the country.

00:51:08.289 --> 00:51:13.441
The casualties were this:
460 killed on the Union side,

00:51:13.441 --> 00:51:17.829
over 1100 wounded,
and 1300 men missing for the

00:51:17.829 --> 00:51:23.627
next month;
a total of almost 2900

00:51:23.627 --> 00:51:27.425
casualties.
On the Confederate side,

00:51:27.425 --> 00:51:30.550
387 killed, 1500 wounded,
and only thirteen missing;

00:51:30.550 --> 00:51:37.132
about 1900 total casualties.
In the wake of Bull Run,

00:51:37.132 --> 00:51:41.406
Lincoln brings George B.
McClellan, this vainglorious

00:51:41.406 --> 00:51:45.516
but handsome as hell,
smart, West Point graduate of

00:51:45.516 --> 00:51:49.380
thirty-four years-old,
to the White House.

00:51:49.380 --> 00:51:52.853
He'd had a couple of small
little victories out in Western

00:51:52.853 --> 00:51:56.509
Virginia where there'd been a
couple of clashes with southern

00:51:56.509 --> 00:51:58.601
troops,
and he brought this

00:51:58.601 --> 00:52:03.238
gold-sash-wearing young officer
to the White House and gave him

00:52:03.238 --> 00:52:07.427
command of this army that they
then named The Army of the

00:52:07.427 --> 00:52:09.657
Potomac.
And the army was being

00:52:09.657 --> 00:52:12.458
increased daily now with
hundreds and hundreds and

00:52:12.458 --> 00:52:14.630
thousands of troops from the
North.

00:52:14.630 --> 00:52:17.862
And McClellan put them into
camp, Camp Brightwood,

00:52:17.862 --> 00:52:21.159
among others--huge
camps--outside of Washington,

00:52:21.159 --> 00:52:28.249
and he'll start training them,
for months and months and

00:52:28.249 --> 00:52:32.830
months.
And the Civil War got longer

00:52:32.830 --> 00:52:38.414
and longer and longer.
And McClellan's not going to

00:52:38.414 --> 00:52:43.369
move that army for another ten
months, nine months,

00:52:43.369 --> 00:52:48.387
until the late Spring of 1862.
Meanwhile, the war is going to

00:52:48.387 --> 00:52:51.300
break out in the West too,
and we'll return to that

00:52:51.300 --> 00:52:52.300
Thursday.

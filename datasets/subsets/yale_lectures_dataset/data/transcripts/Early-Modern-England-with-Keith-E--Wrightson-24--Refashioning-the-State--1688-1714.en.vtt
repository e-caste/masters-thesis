00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.073
Prof: Okay.
 

00:00:04.073 --> 00:00:06.030
Let's get started.
 

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:10.206
When I was at school we were
often told that one of the great

00:00:10.206 --> 00:00:14.590
things about British history was
that the country had never been

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:18.349
successfully invaded by a
foreign power since 1066 when

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:22.246
William the Conqueror and the
Normans conquered the Saxon

00:00:22.246 --> 00:00:24.566
kingdom,
and this was part of the

00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:25.940
national story as we got it.
 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.704
There was a great deal of
emphasis upon successfully

00:00:29.704 --> 00:00:32.951
resisting foreign powers,
the Spanish Armada,

00:00:32.951 --> 00:00:35.240
Napoleon, Hitler,
whatever.

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.737
So no successful foreign
invasion since 1066,

00:00:38.737 --> 00:00:43.029
and this makes a good story,
but unfortunately it's not

00:00:43.029 --> 00:00:44.460
actually true.
 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.298
Britain was very successfully
invaded in November 1688 by a

00:00:50.298 --> 00:00:56.439
largely Dutch army under William
of Orange, Stadtholder of the

00:00:56.439 --> 00:00:58.050
Netherlands.
 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.539
But that of course didn't count.
 

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:07.492
The whole events of 1688 had
been successfully repackaged as

00:01:07.492 --> 00:01:12.530
the essential prelude to the
English Revolution Part Two,

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:18.078
the Glorious Revolution of
1688, taken in the classic Whig

00:01:18.078 --> 00:01:22.947
interpretation of national
history as a fundamental

00:01:22.947 --> 00:01:24.310
watershed.
 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.712
Before 1688,
the country had been beset with

00:01:27.712 --> 00:01:32.379
chronic political instability
and indeed social conflict.

00:01:32.379 --> 00:01:34.849
1688 cleared the way.
 

00:01:34.849 --> 00:01:38.438
It cleared the way for the
establishment of a stable

00:01:38.438 --> 00:01:43.260
constitutional monarchy;
cleared the way for political

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:44.190
liberty.
 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.650
It cleared the way for
religious toleration and

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.334
cultural pluralism,
the triumph of Whig principles

00:01:51.334 --> 00:01:55.105
in that respect;
and security of property and

00:01:55.105 --> 00:01:59.635
growing economic opulence and
the formation of the United

00:01:59.635 --> 00:02:03.599
Kingdom by the Union of England
and Scotland,

00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:08.198
and finally the successful
assertion of national power

00:02:08.198 --> 00:02:12.968
internationally and the growth
of an overseas empire.

00:02:12.968 --> 00:02:16.460
Well, these are some of the key
elements classically stressed

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:20.009
from the eighteenth century
onwards in Whig historiography.

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:23.597
It's a bit of a myth;
a particular,

00:02:23.597 --> 00:02:27.204
rather self-serving,
interpretation of the national

00:02:27.204 --> 00:02:31.532
past with a strong ideological
message about what it is to be

00:02:31.532 --> 00:02:32.470
British.
 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:37.252
But like all historiographical
myths of that kind it did have a

00:02:37.252 --> 00:02:41.044
kernel of truth,
even if it airbrushed out an

00:02:41.044 --> 00:02:45.198
awful lot of the real
complexities of the story and

00:02:45.198 --> 00:02:49.682
tended to represent as being
almost inevitable a set of

00:02:49.682 --> 00:02:53.919
outcomes which were in fact far
more complex,

00:02:53.919 --> 00:02:58.384
far more hesitant,
far more messy than was usually

00:02:58.384 --> 00:02:59.568
recognized.
 

00:02:59.568 --> 00:03:04.573
But still, be that as it may,
these are the processes that we

00:03:04.573 --> 00:03:08.908
need to consider in the final
days of this course.

00:03:08.908 --> 00:03:13.520
Well, as you'll remember,
by 1688 King James II had

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:19.052
succeeded in undermining the
initial strength of his position

00:03:19.052 --> 00:03:23.939
when he came to the crown by
utterly alienating what's

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:29.012
usually referred to as the Tory
Anglican majority in the

00:03:29.012 --> 00:03:34.184
political nation,
people upon whom Charles II had

00:03:34.184 --> 00:03:39.732
counted when he faced down the
Whig opposition in the Exclusion

00:03:39.732 --> 00:03:41.970
Crisis of 1678 to '81.
 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.008
And, at the same time as he
alienated those people,

00:03:46.008 --> 00:03:50.257
James had failed to win the
trust and support of the

00:03:50.257 --> 00:03:55.035
Protestant dissenters,
the low church Anglicans who

00:03:55.035 --> 00:04:00.620
had been the backbone of the
Whig and exclusionist cause.

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.424
The extent of this general
alienation from the King and his

00:04:04.424 --> 00:04:08.294
policies was of course revealed
in the fact that some of the

00:04:08.294 --> 00:04:12.426
leaders of the political nation
were willing to actively support

00:04:12.426 --> 00:04:15.508
intervention by a foreign power
in 1688,

00:04:15.508 --> 00:04:20.129
indeed to invite it in their
famous letter to William III.

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:24.122
And even more,
including James II's own army,

00:04:24.122 --> 00:04:28.478
were willing at least to
acquiesce in the face of

00:04:28.478 --> 00:04:30.930
William's intervention.
 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:34.230
They sat on their hands.
 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:39.357
To this extent one could say
that the Revolution of 1688 was

00:04:39.357 --> 00:04:44.050
in different ways both a Whig
and a Tory revolution.

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.279
It was in part an elite coup
d'etat;

00:04:47.279 --> 00:04:51.199
it was in part a country
revolution.

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:56.120
It merged a range of political
opinion in opposition to James,

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:00.959
in opposition to the specter of
"popery and arbitrary

00:05:00.959 --> 00:05:02.149
power."
 

00:05:02.149 --> 00:05:07.120
And the political settlement as
it emerged reflected that

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.670
composite character of the
Revolution.

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:16.312
On the 22^(nd) of January 1689,
a Convention Parliament met to

00:05:16.312 --> 00:05:19.550
begin working out the
settlement.

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:24.697
It had, it's estimated,
319 members of broadly Whig

00:05:24.697 --> 00:05:30.666
sympathy and 232 of broadly Tory
sympathy plus the House of

00:05:30.666 --> 00:05:34.076
Lords,
but the debates as they went on

00:05:34.076 --> 00:05:38.553
seemed to have become largely
dominated by those of the middle

00:05:38.553 --> 00:05:43.105
ground who managed to hold the
minorities of extremists of both

00:05:43.105 --> 00:05:45.750
political persuasions in check.
 

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:49.680
It seems to have been one of
those rare but instructive

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:54.339
situations in history when the
center is tough and holds firm.

00:05:54.339 --> 00:05:58.160
The Convention's formal
definition of the situation

00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:59.459
reflected that.
 

00:05:59.459 --> 00:06:03.324
It resolved -- and I'm quoting
-- it resolved almost

00:06:03.324 --> 00:06:06.490
unanimously that,
"King James II,

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:11.524
having attempted to subvert the
constitution of the kingdom by

00:06:11.524 --> 00:06:16.064
breaking the contract between
king and people and by the

00:06:16.064 --> 00:06:20.769
advice of Jesuits and other
wicked persons having violated

00:06:20.769 --> 00:06:25.721
the fundamental laws and having
withdrawn himself out of this

00:06:25.721 --> 00:06:30.261
kingdom has abdicated the
government and that the throne

00:06:30.261 --> 00:06:33.149
is thereby vacant."
 

00:06:33.149 --> 00:06:36.225
That's what they resolved,
and note carefully in those

00:06:36.225 --> 00:06:38.779
words;
it's another masterpiece of

00:06:38.779 --> 00:06:42.730
ambiguity comparable to the
communion service in the

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:46.990
Anglican Prayer Book of 1559,
which you'll remember.

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:51.043
They say that James broke the
contract between king and

00:06:51.043 --> 00:06:51.720
people.
 

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:55.449
That's Whig ideology,
the notion of a contract.

00:06:55.449 --> 00:06:59.697
But he also withdrew himself
and abdicated,

00:06:59.697 --> 00:07:05.160
so he hadn't actually been
deposed for his offenses.

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.439
That's an appeal to Tory
sympathy.

00:07:07.439 --> 00:07:10.793
They didn't believe in
resistance to a divinely

00:07:10.793 --> 00:07:15.509
appointed and anointed king;
so he'd abdicated.

00:07:15.509 --> 00:07:19.081
As for the Jesuits and so
forth, well, everyone could

00:07:19.081 --> 00:07:20.180
agree on that.
 

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:25.855
And in all of this of course
the status of the baby Prince

00:07:25.855 --> 00:07:29.339
James was conveniently
forgotten.

00:07:29.339 --> 00:07:32.536
Now this kind of
interpret-it-your-own-way

00:07:32.536 --> 00:07:37.449
attitude also suffused a lot of
the rest of the settlement as it

00:07:37.449 --> 00:07:39.790
unfolded in 1689 and 1690.
 

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:44.744
William was not content to be
simply a regent,

00:07:44.744 --> 00:07:51.240
but he and Mary shared the
crown until her death in 1694.

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:55.430
He was king in effect but he
wasn't an elected king.

00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:59.649
He held the crown in right of
his wife who was a legitimate

00:07:59.649 --> 00:08:03.576
Stuart heir, the Protestant
daughter of James II by his

00:08:03.576 --> 00:08:04.959
first marriage.
 

00:08:04.959 --> 00:08:07.720
And it was agreed that Mary's
youngest sister,

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:11.189
Princess Anne,
would be the next heir,

00:08:11.189 --> 00:08:15.942
ahead of any children that
William and Mary themselves

00:08:15.942 --> 00:08:17.110
might have.
 

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:21.750
Again, all very odd.
 

00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:25.115
The Convention also drew up a
Declaration of Rights later

00:08:25.115 --> 00:08:27.519
passed into law as the Bill of
Rights.

00:08:27.519 --> 00:08:31.007
It was clear on some matters
which found almost universal

00:08:31.007 --> 00:08:35.178
assent, but it was also cautious
and ambiguous in other respects.

00:08:35.178 --> 00:08:37.220
The power of the monarch,
for example,

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:41.260
to suspend the laws was
declared to be illegal but the

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:45.779
dispensing power of the monarch,
the traditional dispensing

00:08:45.779 --> 00:08:49.835
power, was illegal "only as
it hath been exercised of

00:08:49.835 --> 00:08:53.788
late," i.e.,
as it had been exercised by

00:08:53.788 --> 00:08:54.700
James II.
 

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:58.331
Parliaments should be called
frequently and should be freely

00:08:58.331 --> 00:09:02.027
elected, but as yet there were
no specific measures to ensure

00:09:02.027 --> 00:09:03.690
that that would happen.
 

00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:06.671
Roman Catholics were to be
excluded from the crown,

00:09:06.671 --> 00:09:09.711
but as yet there was no
specific provision to ensure

00:09:09.711 --> 00:09:11.620
that that would be the case.
 

00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:14.671
And, above all,
the status of the whole

00:09:14.671 --> 00:09:17.080
document was rather obscure.
 

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:22.038
It looked rather like a
contract with the new monarchs,

00:09:22.038 --> 00:09:26.145
but in fact the offer of the
crown to William and Mary was

00:09:26.145 --> 00:09:29.100
not made conditional upon
accepting it.

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:32.640
The offer of the crown was
actually made on the 13^(th) of

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:36.493
February before the Declaration
of Rights had been presented to

00:09:36.493 --> 00:09:39.600
William and Mary,
and they hadn't formally

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:43.662
accepted it before they were
proclaimed monarchs the next

00:09:43.662 --> 00:09:44.168
day.
 

00:09:44.168 --> 00:09:48.633
So 1689 saw a series of
measures intended to advance the

00:09:48.633 --> 00:09:53.259
transfer of power to William and
Mary and that was rapidly

00:09:53.259 --> 00:09:58.210
consolidated with other acts of
Parliament which again reflect

00:09:58.210 --> 00:10:03.080
the coalition of interests
involved in the Revolution.

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:04.808
They passed a Mutiny Act.
 

00:10:04.808 --> 00:10:09.280
That laid down that no standing
army would be permitted in peace

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:12.048
time unless authorized by
Parliament.

00:10:12.048 --> 00:10:16.078
They voted income to the crown
by taxation but the sums which

00:10:16.078 --> 00:10:20.176
were voted were well known to be
inadequate for even peacetime

00:10:20.176 --> 00:10:23.081
administration,
let alone war time,

00:10:23.081 --> 00:10:27.769
and so Parliament would always
be needed in order to grant

00:10:27.769 --> 00:10:30.320
additional necessary supply.
 

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:32.538
They passed a Toleration Act.
 

00:10:32.538 --> 00:10:36.519
Protestant dissenters were
allowed to worship publicly,

00:10:36.519 --> 00:10:40.563
and by the end of 1690 some
9,000 dissenting meeting houses

00:10:40.563 --> 00:10:44.465
had been opened,
but they were still not

00:10:44.465 --> 00:10:47.600
accorded full civil rights.
 

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:51.340
The Church of England remained
the legally established church,

00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:55.648
the Test Acts were still there
to exclude nonmembers of the

00:10:55.648 --> 00:10:59.139
Church of England from holding
public office.

00:10:59.139 --> 00:11:03.363
But Protestant dissenters were
allowed to worship openly and

00:11:03.363 --> 00:11:06.942
meanwhile Roman Catholics,
Unitarians and Jews were

00:11:06.942 --> 00:11:09.519
permitted to worship in private.
 

00:11:09.519 --> 00:11:12.710
They were tolerated, officially.
 

00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:18.323
Altogether the settlement of
1688 and '9 constituted a kind

00:11:18.323 --> 00:11:21.808
of pragmatic compromise
designed,

00:11:21.808 --> 00:11:24.937
obviously enough,
to appeal to as many people as

00:11:24.937 --> 00:11:28.330
possible and to alienate as few
as possible from the

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:30.259
Revolutionary Settlement.
 

00:11:30.259 --> 00:11:36.200
John Morrill has put it well,
he calls it "a centrist

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:40.889
compromise and a constitutional
blur."

00:11:40.889 --> 00:11:44.285
And as with the Elizabethan
religious settlement of 1559 it

00:11:44.285 --> 00:11:47.917
was full of inconsistencies and
it remained to be seen just how

00:11:47.917 --> 00:11:50.259
they would work it out in
practice,

00:11:50.259 --> 00:11:54.144
how it would be worked out by
political groups who had

00:11:54.144 --> 00:11:57.736
somewhat different
interpretations of just what it

00:11:57.736 --> 00:11:59.129
actually meant.
 

00:11:59.129 --> 00:12:02.210
But worked out it was.
 

00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:06.966
And in the course of the next
twenty-five years or so that

00:12:06.966 --> 00:12:11.307
involved a significant
refashioning of the state as a

00:12:11.307 --> 00:12:16.039
result,
and the emergence by 1714 of a

00:12:16.039 --> 00:12:23.500
British state of a shape and
structure which no one had quite

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:26.360
anticipated in 1688.
 

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:31.244
Well, that British state was
shaped partly by political

00:12:31.244 --> 00:12:32.418
principles.
 

00:12:32.418 --> 00:12:36.570
It was shaped partly by
political and religious

00:12:36.570 --> 00:12:41.533
prejudices, and partly also by
the constraining force of

00:12:41.533 --> 00:12:44.058
immediate circumstances.
 

00:12:44.058 --> 00:12:48.600
And of those circumstances the
dominant circumstance was war.

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:52.105
The modern British state,
it could be said,

00:12:52.105 --> 00:12:55.360
was forged under the stresses
of war.

00:12:55.360 --> 00:13:00.469
William of Orange hadn't
intervened in 1688 out of his

00:13:00.469 --> 00:13:05.000
deep personal concern for
England's religion and

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.350
liberties.
 

00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:10.311
His intervention was part and
parcel of his life's mission of

00:13:10.311 --> 00:13:14.008
containing the threatened
hegemony of the French monarchy

00:13:14.008 --> 00:13:17.969
of Louis XIV and in particular
the threat it posed to his own

00:13:17.969 --> 00:13:20.710
country,
the Netherlands.

00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:26.840
And the price of William's
intervention was war.

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:30.275
War first of all to defend the
Revolutionary Settlement against

00:13:30.275 --> 00:13:33.621
Jacobite risings --
Jacobites being supporters of

00:13:33.621 --> 00:13:37.517
James --
Jacobite risings in Scotland in

00:13:37.517 --> 00:13:41.312
1689 to '90,
then to oust James II from

00:13:41.312 --> 00:13:46.360
Ireland where he'd landed with
an army in 1689 to '91,

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:49.558
culminating in the Battle of
the Boyne at which James was

00:13:49.558 --> 00:13:51.558
defeated and fled back to
France.

00:13:51.558 --> 00:13:57.058
Then war in the Netherlands
against Louis XIV between 1688

00:13:57.058 --> 00:14:02.365
and 1697 to contain the French
who were James' principal

00:14:02.365 --> 00:14:06.830
supporters,
and then again after William

00:14:06.830 --> 00:14:13.298
III's death in 1702 renewed war
between 1702 and 1713 to defeat

00:14:13.298 --> 00:14:17.678
the renewed menace of French
hegemony,

00:14:17.678 --> 00:14:22.624
which included French
recognition of the claims of

00:14:22.624 --> 00:14:24.340
James II's son.
 

00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:27.320
James had died in 1701.
 

00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:30.097
His son and heir,
James III, to those who

00:14:30.097 --> 00:14:33.008
supported him,
was known as "The

00:14:33.008 --> 00:14:36.386
Pretender"
to the crowns of England and

00:14:36.386 --> 00:14:39.719
Scotland;
thirteen years old when his

00:14:39.719 --> 00:14:40.870
father died.
 

00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:47.509
So then between 1688 and 1713
we have a whole generation of

00:14:47.509 --> 00:14:54.149
major wars being fought on land
and sea, mostly against the

00:14:54.149 --> 00:14:55.408
French.
 

00:14:55.408 --> 00:14:59.070
Given its commitment to the
Revolution,

00:14:59.070 --> 00:15:02.115
the political nation
represented in Parliament was

00:15:02.115 --> 00:15:05.418
willing,
though very reluctant,

00:15:05.418 --> 00:15:09.940
to recognize the need for these
wars.

00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:13.729
But at the same time Parliament
was acutely sensitive to the

00:15:13.729 --> 00:15:17.582
danger that they might lead to a
buildup of royal power which

00:15:17.582 --> 00:15:23.884
might threaten its own position,
might raise again that specter

00:15:23.884 --> 00:15:26.500
of arbitrary power.
 

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:30.501
Out of the interaction of that
necessity to fight the wars and

00:15:30.501 --> 00:15:33.389
that anxiety about where they
might lead,

00:15:33.389 --> 00:15:37.428
there eventually emerged what
was, on the one hand,

00:15:37.428 --> 00:15:41.620
a far more powerful state
apparatus --

00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:45.764
it's been described famously by
John Brewer as the "fiscal

00:15:45.764 --> 00:15:49.240
military state"
which emerges at this time --

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:54.337
and yet, on the other hand,
it was a more powerful state

00:15:54.337 --> 00:15:59.437
apparatus which remained very
firmly under parliamentary

00:15:59.437 --> 00:16:00.548
control.
 

00:16:00.548 --> 00:16:02.899
The key to the whole process,
as you'll be aware,

00:16:02.899 --> 00:16:06.716
was finance,
but to understand that we have

00:16:06.716 --> 00:16:12.440
to step back first a little bit
in time and look at what's known

00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:15.528
as the 'Financial Revolution'.
 

00:16:15.528 --> 00:16:19.105
Now, as you know,
by the standards of the day

00:16:19.105 --> 00:16:23.980
England was a relatively rich
country by the late seventeenth

00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:26.500
century and getting richer.
 

00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:30.253
Earlier in the century,
however, governments had rarely

00:16:30.253 --> 00:16:34.216
succeeded in tapping that wealth
effectively for their own

00:16:34.216 --> 00:16:35.120
purposes.
 

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:38.702
The late seventeenth and early
eighteenth centuries and the

00:16:38.702 --> 00:16:42.225
so-called Financial Revolution
saw a transformation of the

00:16:42.225 --> 00:16:46.653
'fiscal capacity' of the state,
that is its ability to raise

00:16:46.653 --> 00:16:50.298
money for its purposes,
and consequently a

00:16:50.298 --> 00:16:55.240
transformation of its capacity
for effective action.

00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:57.220
And this was the outcome of
developments which,

00:16:57.220 --> 00:17:00.340
in the words of one recent
historian of the Financial

00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:03.070
Revolution,
"transformed the

00:17:03.070 --> 00:17:06.660
willingness,
rather than the ability,

00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:10.740
of the English people to pay
high taxes,

00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:14.306
lend large sums,
and above all repose great

00:17:14.306 --> 00:17:17.957
trust in the financial
institutions of their

00:17:17.957 --> 00:17:20.930
parliamentary government."
 

00:17:20.930 --> 00:17:24.730
That's Henry Roseveare I'm
quoting.

00:17:24.730 --> 00:17:30.520
Parliamentary government and
the trust which it could inspire

00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:35.828
was perhaps indeed the key to
this whole development.

00:17:35.828 --> 00:17:38.967
Under Charles II,
Parliament's ultimate control

00:17:38.967 --> 00:17:42.650
of the public purse was of
course not in doubt but,

00:17:42.650 --> 00:17:45.355
as you know,
suspicion of the crown's

00:17:45.355 --> 00:17:49.191
policies could mean that
Parliament was unwilling to

00:17:49.191 --> 00:17:50.470
grant supply.
 

00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:55.046
Indeed, in 1672 the situation
in royal finances had become so

00:17:55.046 --> 00:17:57.015
bad,
the crown became so

00:17:57.015 --> 00:18:01.519
overstretched as a debtor,
that it led to what's known as

00:18:01.519 --> 00:18:05.982
the 'Stop of the Exchequer' in
which Charles II postponed

00:18:05.982 --> 00:18:09.650
repayments of his debts to
private lenders.

00:18:09.650 --> 00:18:13.548
Many London bankers were
completely ruined as a result.

00:18:13.548 --> 00:18:19.502
It was a very severe blow to
the crown's credit and its

00:18:19.502 --> 00:18:22.259
ability to raise money.
 

00:18:22.259 --> 00:18:26.230
Well after 1688 that kind of
situation was transformed,

00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:29.519
transformed in less than ten
years,

00:18:29.519 --> 00:18:33.509
in the face of the need to
raise money for the wars fought

00:18:33.509 --> 00:18:36.380
to defend the Revolutionary
Settlement.

00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:41.263
It's a long and complex story,
but the essence of it all was

00:18:41.263 --> 00:18:46.065
quite nicely contained in a
statement made by Lord Macaulay

00:18:46.065 --> 00:18:50.368
in his history of all this
written back in 1848.

00:18:50.368 --> 00:18:53.809
Macaulay wrote,
"from a period of

00:18:53.809 --> 00:18:59.480
immemorial antiquity it has been
the practice of every English

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:02.548
government to contract debts.
 

00:19:02.548 --> 00:19:08.391
What the Revolution introduced
was the practice of honestly

00:19:08.391 --> 00:19:10.910
paying them back."
 

00:19:10.910 --> 00:19:16.005
Parliament was now fully in
control not only of grant of

00:19:16.005 --> 00:19:18.970
supply but of its expenditure.
 

00:19:18.970 --> 00:19:21.470
Annual estimates were made of
need.

00:19:21.470 --> 00:19:23.318
Supply was voted.
 

00:19:23.318 --> 00:19:27.980
The accounts were audited by
parliamentary commissioners.

00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:32.896
Revenue was now regarded as the
public revenue rather than the

00:19:32.896 --> 00:19:34.509
monarch's revenue.
 

00:19:34.509 --> 00:19:38.875
And from 1698 even the ordinary
day-to-day expenses of the crown

00:19:38.875 --> 00:19:41.509
were controlled by an annual
grant,

00:19:41.509 --> 00:19:44.982
the so-called 'Civil List',
the money paid for running the

00:19:44.982 --> 00:19:47.359
day-to-day business of the
monarchy,

00:19:47.359 --> 00:19:49.818
as still happens.
 

00:19:49.818 --> 00:19:55.780
Parliament sanctioned a whole
series of devices to raise money

00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:57.150
for the war.
 

00:19:57.150 --> 00:20:01.459
In 1690, it voted a Land Tax,
a quite heavy tax on landowners

00:20:01.459 --> 00:20:04.618
which brought in a reliable
annual income.

00:20:04.618 --> 00:20:09.233
Loans were raised on the
security of parliamentary

00:20:09.233 --> 00:20:10.269
taxation.
 

00:20:10.269 --> 00:20:14.510
Longer term borrowing was
achieved by means of the sale of

00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:18.678
annuities to the public with the
regular payment of those

00:20:18.678 --> 00:20:22.250
annuities secured by
parliamentary taxation.

00:20:22.250 --> 00:20:25.213
They tried out lotteries as a
way of raising money,

00:20:25.213 --> 00:20:27.288
again with Parliament's
sanction.

00:20:27.288 --> 00:20:32.759
In 1694, the Bank of England
was chartered.

00:20:32.759 --> 00:20:37.275
Lenders were brought to
subscribe to a 1.2 million pound

00:20:37.275 --> 00:20:41.790
loan with the interest and the
eventual repayment of the

00:20:41.790 --> 00:20:44.828
capital guaranteed from
taxation.

00:20:44.828 --> 00:20:49.111
The Bank of England was not a
central bank in the modern

00:20:49.111 --> 00:20:53.548
sense, but it was a vehicle
devised to raise money for the

00:20:53.548 --> 00:20:55.338
needs of the state.
 

00:20:55.338 --> 00:20:58.740
There was also the development
of a market in various forms of

00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:01.137
state securities,
these new state securities

00:21:01.137 --> 00:21:02.700
which were being issued.
 

00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:07.315
They could be sold on to third
parties and it was at the core

00:21:07.315 --> 00:21:11.930
of the emergence of dealings in
stocks, the beginnings of the

00:21:11.930 --> 00:21:13.930
London Stock Exchange.
 

00:21:13.930 --> 00:21:17.755
All of this was initiated in a
piecemeal and a rather

00:21:17.755 --> 00:21:21.252
improvised manner,
year by year they dreamed up

00:21:21.252 --> 00:21:25.230
something new as a way of
raising the money they needed.

00:21:25.230 --> 00:21:29.009
But gradually by the early
eighteenth century it had

00:21:29.009 --> 00:21:33.310
coalesced into a system,
and fundamental to the whole

00:21:33.310 --> 00:21:37.748
emerging edifice was an
effective tax system which made

00:21:37.748 --> 00:21:41.940
possible the servicing of a
growing public debt.

00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:45.240
Initially the Land Tax,
quite heavy,

00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:49.279
about 20% on landed income in
the richest counties,

00:21:49.279 --> 00:21:52.490
and then increasingly the use
of the Excise,

00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:56.211
which was indirect taxes
collected by a growing corpus of

00:21:56.211 --> 00:22:00.868
public officials,
Excise Men as they were known.

00:22:00.868 --> 00:22:05.838
And as this system developed
there was a growth of confidence

00:22:05.838 --> 00:22:10.558
in the financial probity and
reliability of the state,

00:22:10.558 --> 00:22:15.106
and that growing confidence
transformed people's willingness

00:22:15.106 --> 00:22:18.190
to lend their money to the
government.

00:22:18.190 --> 00:22:22.730
Public revenues increased
massively.

00:22:22.730 --> 00:22:26.790
By 1700, it's been estimated
that about 9% of national income

00:22:26.790 --> 00:22:30.857
was being taken in taxation,
and by the same year about a

00:22:30.857 --> 00:22:35.215
third of the revenue raised by
the state was being used to fund

00:22:35.215 --> 00:22:36.130
the debts.
 

00:22:36.130 --> 00:22:41.460
By 1714, the national debt had
risen to 48 million pounds,

00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:44.380
a massive sum by the standards
of the day,

00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:48.534
most of it funded by
parliamentary pledges to pay the

00:22:48.534 --> 00:22:51.730
interest and eventually the
principal.

00:22:51.730 --> 00:22:56.019
In 1717, after the end of the
War of the Spanish Succession,

00:22:56.019 --> 00:23:01.306
a variety of sinking funds were
established to pay off parts of

00:23:01.306 --> 00:23:04.643
the debt,
but it was generally recognized

00:23:04.643 --> 00:23:08.804
that a public debt of some size,
reliably serviced in the way

00:23:08.804 --> 00:23:12.744
I've described,
would be a permanent fact of

00:23:12.744 --> 00:23:14.538
life thereafter.
 

00:23:14.538 --> 00:23:18.980
In short, what they'd done in
the Financial Revolution was to

00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:22.228
create,
gradually, a stable system of

00:23:22.228 --> 00:23:26.986
public credit based upon
parliamentary taxation and with

00:23:26.986 --> 00:23:31.742
it a regime which has been
described as having "the

00:23:31.742 --> 00:23:37.099
political support,
the administrative capacity and

00:23:37.099 --> 00:23:42.497
the fiscal base required to
accumulate and service a

00:23:42.497 --> 00:23:45.990
perpetual national debt."
 

00:23:45.990 --> 00:23:51.873
So in the years after 1688 the
fiscal capacity of the state was

00:23:51.873 --> 00:23:55.288
rapidly and massively
transformed.

00:23:55.288 --> 00:23:58.676
John Brewer calls this a
"fiscal military

00:23:58.676 --> 00:24:03.269
state" because so much of
the enhanced public revenue was

00:24:03.269 --> 00:24:04.548
spent on war.
 

00:24:04.548 --> 00:24:09.461
Military expenditure as a
proportion of national income

00:24:09.461 --> 00:24:14.009
was about 2% at the death of
Charles II in 1685.

00:24:14.009 --> 00:24:18.391
By 1700 it was 4%,
in 1710 at the height of the

00:24:18.391 --> 00:24:23.630
War of the Spanish Succession it
peaked at over 14%,

00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:30.544
and then it settled down after
peace came in 1714 at about 5%

00:24:30.544 --> 00:24:35.114
even in peace time,
mostly as a result of the

00:24:35.114 --> 00:24:39.997
regular expenditure which was
maintaining the Royal Navy as a

00:24:39.997 --> 00:24:42.519
permanent military presence.
 

00:24:42.519 --> 00:24:47.890
Now all of this could have been
potentially destabilizing,

00:24:47.890 --> 00:24:51.657
and there were times in the
1690s as they went from year to

00:24:51.657 --> 00:24:55.296
year trying to raise money that
the whole thing sometimes

00:24:55.296 --> 00:24:58.348
teetered on the edge of
potential collapse.

00:24:58.348 --> 00:25:01.743
There was a real risk in 1696
that they wouldn't be able to

00:25:01.743 --> 00:25:03.558
raise enough money,
for example,

00:25:03.558 --> 00:25:04.730
to pay the army.
 

00:25:04.730 --> 00:25:07.568
But they managed to sustain it.
 

00:25:07.568 --> 00:25:10.838
They improvised their way
through and eventually,

00:25:10.838 --> 00:25:14.144
as I said, it coalesced into a
system which provided the

00:25:14.144 --> 00:25:17.567
underpinning for the emergence
of England as a significant

00:25:17.567 --> 00:25:23.730
military power,
a significant world power.

00:25:23.730 --> 00:25:27.913
But if Parliament was willing
to provide the resources which

00:25:27.913 --> 00:25:31.599
made possible that kind of
growth in the power of the

00:25:31.599 --> 00:25:35.720
state,
Parliament also exacted a price.

00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:40.420
It exacted a price politically.
 

00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:43.750
As John Brewer shows,
the prevalent suspicion of

00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:47.862
central government amongst
parliamentarians meant that they

00:25:47.862 --> 00:25:51.617
exerted themselves to try to
shape this emergent state

00:25:51.617 --> 00:25:55.090
apparatus in ways that would
accord with their own

00:25:55.090 --> 00:25:58.391
preferences,
their so-called country

00:25:58.391 --> 00:26:02.328
attitudes, their suspicion of
central government.

00:26:02.328 --> 00:26:05.916
The need for annual
parliamentary supply meant that

00:26:05.916 --> 00:26:10.077
Parliament became a permanent
part of the government of the

00:26:10.077 --> 00:26:10.940
country.
 

00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:14.900
They had to have parliamentary
sessions every single year.

00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:16.750
No one had anticipated that.
 

00:26:16.750 --> 00:26:20.990
It just happened;
it was necessary.

00:26:20.990 --> 00:26:24.586
The money which was granted to
the government by these

00:26:24.586 --> 00:26:28.385
parliaments was very carefully
monitored according to the

00:26:28.385 --> 00:26:31.715
system of 'appropriation',
the principle of

00:26:31.715 --> 00:26:33.019
'appropriation'.
 

00:26:33.019 --> 00:26:37.364
That's to say parliamentary
grants could be used only for

00:26:37.364 --> 00:26:41.009
the purposes for which they had
been granted.

00:26:41.009 --> 00:26:47.637
Therefore, policy had to be in
accord with Parliament's wishes,

00:26:47.637 --> 00:26:51.058
to meet Parliament's approval.
 

00:26:51.058 --> 00:26:54.654
Royal ministers might be chosen
by the crown but,

00:26:54.654 --> 00:26:59.147
again, they needed to be men
who could command the support of

00:26:59.147 --> 00:27:02.068
a majority in the House of
Commons.

00:27:02.068 --> 00:27:05.092
If they had no majority in the
House of Commons,

00:27:05.092 --> 00:27:08.693
they were unable to achieve
anything, they were unable to

00:27:08.693 --> 00:27:11.009
get the supply that they needed.
 

00:27:11.009 --> 00:27:15.442
And in other more specific
ways, as Brewer puts it,

00:27:15.442 --> 00:27:20.494
"fiscal control put the
bite into the bark of country

00:27:20.494 --> 00:27:22.180
politics."
 

00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:26.420
Sometimes they would tack on to
revenue bills a Place Act.

00:27:26.420 --> 00:27:29.768
That was an act which attempted
to exclude government officials

00:27:29.768 --> 00:27:32.414
from the House of Commons in
order to preserve the

00:27:32.414 --> 00:27:34.088
independence of Parliament.
 

00:27:34.088 --> 00:27:40.349
In 1694, William III was forced
to accept a new and strengthened

00:27:40.349 --> 00:27:44.316
Triennial Act,
under which Parliament should

00:27:44.316 --> 00:27:49.103
be not only called every three
years but should not sit longer

00:27:49.103 --> 00:27:52.400
than three years without new
elections.

00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:54.828
So they had to have elections
every three years,

00:27:54.828 --> 00:27:59.325
a very significant curtailment
of the royal prerogative to call

00:27:59.325 --> 00:28:03.240
and then to dissolve Parliament
when the king chose.

00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:07.691
William resisted it strongly
but he had to give way in the

00:28:07.691 --> 00:28:08.160
end.
 

00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:11.884
By 1700, the relationship
between the ministers in the

00:28:11.884 --> 00:28:16.472
royal government,
those who sat in the Cabinet,

00:28:16.472 --> 00:28:21.633
and Parliament,
had become the crucial axis of

00:28:21.633 --> 00:28:23.390
political life.
 

00:28:23.390 --> 00:28:26.819
And the struggle of those
ministers to establish and to

00:28:26.819 --> 00:28:29.680
maintain a working majority in
Parliament,

00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:34.452
above all in the House of
Commons, was giving rise to an

00:28:34.452 --> 00:28:39.397
increasingly vigorous brand of
organized party politics in

00:28:39.397 --> 00:28:40.700
Parliament.
 

00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:44.269
The old abusive labels,
Whig and Tory,

00:28:44.269 --> 00:28:47.352
which, as you know,
had first appeared to hurl

00:28:47.352 --> 00:28:50.640
against your enemies in the
Exclusion Crisis,

00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:55.259
these were now revived and
perpetuated to describe

00:28:55.259 --> 00:28:59.229
different groupings,
groupings which had different

00:28:59.229 --> 00:29:02.392
interpretations of the meaning
of the Revolution and

00:29:02.392 --> 00:29:05.929
differences of view about how
the Revolutionary Settlement

00:29:05.929 --> 00:29:07.480
should be developed.
 

00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:11.057
By 1700, the Whigs and the
Tories were fairly organized

00:29:11.057 --> 00:29:14.503
groups: they had their own
favorite meeting places in

00:29:14.503 --> 00:29:18.153
London,
they had their own newspapers,

00:29:18.153 --> 00:29:21.960
they had their own national
followings.

00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:26.208
The adversarial politics of
Whigs and Tories influenced

00:29:26.208 --> 00:29:31.086
political life at the level of
the city, at the level of county

00:29:31.086 --> 00:29:32.108
politics.
 

00:29:32.108 --> 00:29:37.454
It erupted periodically in the
vigorous contests of the many

00:29:37.454 --> 00:29:42.710
general elections which were
held between 1695 and 1715.

00:29:42.710 --> 00:29:45.443
There were ten general
elections in those years in

00:29:45.443 --> 00:29:48.903
which it's estimated something
like a quarter of the adult male

00:29:48.903 --> 00:29:52.419
population exercised their votes
and the election campaigns were

00:29:52.419 --> 00:29:56.791
full of competing --
of competition -- for seats in

00:29:56.791 --> 00:30:02.150
which the Whigs and Tories
organized their supporters.

00:30:02.150 --> 00:30:05.278
These alignments were even such
that in the city of York,

00:30:05.278 --> 00:30:09.060
where they had assembly rooms
where polite society met to hold

00:30:09.060 --> 00:30:12.500
balls and other occasions,
concerts and so forth,

00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:16.673
there was one assembly room for
the Whigs and one for the

00:30:16.673 --> 00:30:17.420
Tories.
 

00:30:17.420 --> 00:30:22.519
But if Whigs and Tories fought
furiously for dominance in both

00:30:22.519 --> 00:30:25.528
Parliament and in local
politics,

00:30:25.528 --> 00:30:32.565
there were also vital areas in
which they were fundamentally at

00:30:32.565 --> 00:30:36.538
one,
and that was revealed in 1701

00:30:36.538 --> 00:30:41.690
when the death of Princess
Anne's only child,

00:30:41.690 --> 00:30:46.471
the ultimate heir to the
throne, called into question the

00:30:46.471 --> 00:30:49.288
future succession of the crown.
 

00:30:49.288 --> 00:30:56.058
This precipitated the so-called
Act of Settlement of 1701.

00:30:56.058 --> 00:30:59.471
It's known as the Act of
Settlement but the actual title

00:30:59.471 --> 00:31:01.578
of the act is quite significant.
 

00:31:01.578 --> 00:31:06.973
It was actually called "An
Act for the Further Limitation

00:31:06.973 --> 00:31:12.900
of the Crown and Better Securing
the Rights of the Subject".

00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:16.696
This act, which obtained
support from both sides

00:31:16.696 --> 00:31:19.837
politically,
passed over fifty-seven

00:31:19.837 --> 00:31:24.868
possible claimants to the crown
on the grounds that they were

00:31:24.868 --> 00:31:29.817
Roman Catholics and it fixed the
succession on the Electress

00:31:29.817 --> 00:31:33.970
Sophia of Hanover,
ruler of a small north German

00:31:33.970 --> 00:31:37.660
principality who was descended
from King James I.

00:31:37.660 --> 00:31:43.557
Sophia of Hanover and her heirs
were chosen as the nearest

00:31:43.557 --> 00:31:46.038
Protestant successors.
 

00:31:46.038 --> 00:31:49.261
The Act also required that
future monarchs should be

00:31:49.261 --> 00:31:51.788
communicants of the Church of
England;

00:31:51.788 --> 00:31:55.788
it forbade their marriage to
Roman Catholics;

00:31:55.788 --> 00:31:59.403
it restricted the movements of
the monarch outside the kingdom,

00:31:59.403 --> 00:32:02.548
they could not leave the
kingdom without permission;

00:32:02.548 --> 00:32:06.030
and, in addition,
it made royal privy councilors

00:32:06.030 --> 00:32:10.070
more accountable to Parliament,
restricted the election of

00:32:10.070 --> 00:32:13.288
placemen from the government to
the House of Commons,

00:32:13.288 --> 00:32:16.468
and declared that,
in future, judges in the law

00:32:16.468 --> 00:32:20.614
courts should enjoy their tenure
during good behavior and not

00:32:20.614 --> 00:32:23.240
merely at the will of the
monarch.

00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:26.613
So a specific contingency,
the problem over the

00:32:26.613 --> 00:32:30.808
succession,
gave rise to a far-reaching set

00:32:30.808 --> 00:32:36.839
of statutory restrictions on the
crown's actions which found

00:32:36.839 --> 00:32:39.088
widespread support.
 

00:32:39.088 --> 00:32:42.367
In sum then,
by the time Queen Anne came to

00:32:42.367 --> 00:32:46.192
the throne in 1702 with the
prospect of the future

00:32:46.192 --> 00:32:50.098
Hanoverian succession,
which actually eventually took

00:32:50.098 --> 00:32:52.740
place in 1714 when Electress
Sophia's son,

00:32:52.740 --> 00:32:56.529
George, became king,,
with all of that it can be said

00:32:56.529 --> 00:33:00.683
that some of the fundamental
political issues which had so

00:33:00.683 --> 00:33:04.472
disturbed the seventeenth
century were close to being

00:33:04.472 --> 00:33:08.244
resolved,
with general acceptance of

00:33:08.244 --> 00:33:10.150
those resolutions.
 

00:33:10.150 --> 00:33:15.285
The issue of the security of
the Protestant religion and of

00:33:15.285 --> 00:33:20.509
the toleration of religious
dissenters had been resolved.

00:33:20.509 --> 00:33:25.297
The issue of Parliament's role
and its permanence in the

00:33:25.297 --> 00:33:28.170
constitution had been resolved.
 

00:33:28.170 --> 00:33:32.356
The issue of the royal
prerogative in matters of state

00:33:32.356 --> 00:33:36.150
and how far it could be
controlled or reduced.

00:33:36.150 --> 00:33:39.618
The problem of effective
government finance.

00:33:39.618 --> 00:33:44.089
The problem of how to contain
differences of political

00:33:44.089 --> 00:33:48.982
principle without those partisan
differences leading to the

00:33:48.982 --> 00:33:54.127
breakdown of government or to
civil war had been resolved with

00:33:54.127 --> 00:33:55.900
party politics.
 

00:33:55.900 --> 00:34:00.885
The structures and practices of
the English state had been

00:34:00.885 --> 00:34:06.047
refashioned in a manner which
both enhanced the power of the

00:34:06.047 --> 00:34:11.121
state and at the same time
contained the power of the state

00:34:11.121 --> 00:34:16.719
in ways which would be conducive
to safeguarding the liberties of

00:34:16.719 --> 00:34:18.469
the subject.
 

00:34:18.469 --> 00:34:22.150
Well, one final element remains.
 

00:34:22.150 --> 00:34:28.340
From 1707, this emergent state
was not just an English but a

00:34:28.340 --> 00:34:32.851
British state,
with the constitutional union

00:34:32.851 --> 00:34:37.050
in May 1707 of England and
Scotland.

00:34:37.050 --> 00:34:44.452
Ireland remained technically a
separate kingdom until 1801,

00:34:44.452 --> 00:34:50.579
though one ruled by a
Protestant landed elite.

00:34:50.579 --> 00:34:53.989
Now in Scotland much of the
kingdom,

00:34:53.989 --> 00:34:58.940
particularly lowland Scotland
and some parts of the Highlands,

00:34:58.940 --> 00:35:02.813
those parts of the western
Highlands of Scotland which were

00:35:02.813 --> 00:35:06.753
dominated by the Clan Campbell
who were both Protestants and

00:35:06.753 --> 00:35:11.172
Whigs in politics,
much of Scotland then had

00:35:11.172 --> 00:35:14.980
welcomed the Revolution of 1688.
 

00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:19.992
And rebellions by some of the
Jacobite clans of highland

00:35:19.992 --> 00:35:23.730
Scotland were swiftly put down
in 1690.

00:35:23.730 --> 00:35:29.286
But in the years that followed,
if the 1690s witnessed a kind

00:35:29.286 --> 00:35:34.472
of resurgence of Scotland's
political independence it was

00:35:34.472 --> 00:35:39.380
also a profoundly traumatic
decade for the Scots.

00:35:39.380 --> 00:35:44.070
Scotland remained a relatively
poor country;

00:35:44.070 --> 00:35:48.460
magnificent landscape but
somewhat barren.

00:35:48.460 --> 00:35:53.699
It was largely a subsistence
economy in the rural areas and

00:35:53.699 --> 00:35:56.230
it was a very fragile one.
 

00:35:56.230 --> 00:35:59.894
In 1695 to '99,
Scotland suffered dreadful

00:35:59.894 --> 00:36:05.260
famine known as the "ill
Years of King William."

00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:09.030
It's possible that as much as
13% of the population of

00:36:09.030 --> 00:36:13.297
Scotland died in those years and
indeed much more in the most

00:36:13.297 --> 00:36:15.289
marginal highland areas.
 

00:36:15.289 --> 00:36:18.340
In the highland Aberdeenshire
up here,

00:36:18.340 --> 00:36:22.119
the highland areas of
northeastern Scotland,

00:36:22.119 --> 00:36:27.927
it's estimated that perhaps a
third of the population died in

00:36:27.927 --> 00:36:29.090
the 1690s.
 

00:36:29.090 --> 00:36:32.340
Scotland had relatively little
manufacturing industry.

00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:33.800
It was little developed.
 

00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:38.710
The most important sector was
the manufacture of linen on

00:36:38.710 --> 00:36:43.360
Tayside up here and over near
Glasgow in the west,

00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:48.135
and this was an industry which
was principally dependent upon

00:36:48.135 --> 00:36:51.320
selling that linen to English
markets.

00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:54.400
Overseas trade was also
relatively limited.

00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:59.891
Scotland was excluded from
England's colonial trade as a

00:36:59.891 --> 00:37:04.400
separate kingdom,
and efforts made by some Scots

00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:09.420
in the 1690s to try to establish
a colonial foothold of their

00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:11.371
own,
when they attempted to

00:37:11.371 --> 00:37:15.990
establish a colony in Panama,
the Darien scheme in 1695 to

00:37:15.990 --> 00:37:21.715
'99, unfortunately those efforts
proved to be a disastrous

00:37:21.715 --> 00:37:22.820
failure.
 

00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:27.255
Not least because the English
government refused to help a

00:37:27.255 --> 00:37:31.846
venture which antagonized Spain
by attempting to establish a

00:37:31.846 --> 00:37:36.514
Scottish colonial presence in
territories regarded as part of

00:37:36.514 --> 00:37:38.460
the Spanish empire.
 

00:37:38.460 --> 00:37:44.097
Well, all of these unhappy
events provided the political

00:37:44.097 --> 00:37:48.610
and economic context of the
Union of 1707.

00:37:48.610 --> 00:37:52.333
The Scots were extremely
conscious, of course,

00:37:52.333 --> 00:37:56.719
of their distinctive national
identity and history.

00:37:56.719 --> 00:38:01.650
They were anxious to preserve
their national integrity.

00:38:01.650 --> 00:38:04.742
In the 1690s,
the Scottish Parliament was

00:38:04.742 --> 00:38:09.536
enjoying a greater independence
from the crown than it had ever

00:38:09.536 --> 00:38:11.159
done so hitherto.
 

00:38:11.159 --> 00:38:15.996
But economically the most
dynamic sectors of the Scottish

00:38:15.996 --> 00:38:21.351
economy were heavily dependent
upon England and some Scots were

00:38:21.351 --> 00:38:25.931
also attracted to the
possibility of obtaining greater

00:38:25.931 --> 00:38:30.681
access to English markets and
participation as equals in

00:38:30.681 --> 00:38:33.360
English colonial trade.
 

00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:37.635
Meanwhile, the English
government was interested in a

00:38:37.635 --> 00:38:42.074
closer union with Scotland for
quite different reasons,

00:38:42.074 --> 00:38:44.869
for largely political reasons.
 

00:38:44.869 --> 00:38:49.139
In 1701, when the Act of
Settlement was passed fixing the

00:38:49.139 --> 00:38:51.960
succession in the Hanoverian
line,

00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:58.030
the Scottish Parliament did not
at first follow England's lead

00:38:58.030 --> 00:39:02.309
in recognizing the Hanoverian
succession.

00:39:02.309 --> 00:39:05.161
This raised,
in the early years of the

00:39:05.161 --> 00:39:08.400
eighteenth century,
a potentially dangerous

00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:09.480
situation.
 

00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:15.398
What if the Scottish Parliament
decided to recognize a Stuart

00:39:15.398 --> 00:39:19.126
succession,
decided to vest their crown in

00:39:19.126 --> 00:39:22.018
the old line,
the Stuart line,

00:39:22.018 --> 00:39:24.809
after Queen Anne's death?
 

00:39:24.809 --> 00:39:28.800
If that happened it could
potentially provide a major

00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:30.030
security risk.
 

00:39:30.030 --> 00:39:33.981
It could return to a situation
in which the two kingdoms,

00:39:33.981 --> 00:39:38.074
which had been joined only in
the person of their monarchs,

00:39:38.074 --> 00:39:39.840
might fully separate.
 

00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:44.911
That might pose a new threat to
England from the north,

00:39:44.911 --> 00:39:50.076
especially if the Scots had a
Stuart crown allied to the

00:39:50.076 --> 00:39:51.110
French.
 

00:39:51.110 --> 00:39:54.184
The English government
therefore began to put on

00:39:54.184 --> 00:39:58.371
pressure for a union which would
remove that threat and they were

00:39:58.371 --> 00:40:01.840
willing to use economic leverage
to try to do so.

00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:05.809
In 1705, the English parliament
passed the Alien Acts,

00:40:05.809 --> 00:40:11.222
which excluded the Scots from
English markets unless they

00:40:11.222 --> 00:40:15.670
commenced negotiations for a
possible union.

00:40:15.670 --> 00:40:19.195
And, on the other hand,
it held out the prospect of

00:40:19.195 --> 00:40:23.780
economic advantages for Scotland
if they were willing to do so.

00:40:23.780 --> 00:40:28.871
Now in Scotland the issue was
very passionately debated both

00:40:28.871 --> 00:40:33.099
in Parliament and in the streets
of Edinburgh,

00:40:33.099 --> 00:40:37.547
but in those debates the
economic advantages of union

00:40:37.547 --> 00:40:40.030
soon came well to the fore.
 

00:40:40.030 --> 00:40:43.619
As one opponent of the union,
Alexander Fletcher of Saltoun,

00:40:43.619 --> 00:40:49.404
put it, the economic issues
were "the bait that covers

00:40:49.404 --> 00:40:51.099
the hook."
 

00:40:51.099 --> 00:40:55.045
And, in the event,
that carried the day with those

00:40:55.045 --> 00:40:59.474
of the Scottish elite in
Scotland's Parliament who ended

00:40:59.474 --> 00:41:01.650
up making the decision.
 

00:41:01.650 --> 00:41:06.701
In 1707, after protracted
negotiations a Treaty of Union

00:41:06.701 --> 00:41:08.630
was at last agreed.
 

00:41:08.630 --> 00:41:13.686
There would be a single United
Kingdom of Great Britain with a

00:41:13.686 --> 00:41:17.170
single flag, the "Union
Jack."

00:41:17.170 --> 00:41:21.070
You'll see, lovingly drawn on
the bottom of your handout,

00:41:21.070 --> 00:41:21.557
the St.
 

00:41:21.557 --> 00:41:23.648
George flag of England,
the St.

00:41:23.648 --> 00:41:27.409
Andrew's flag of Scotland,
and how they merged together

00:41:27.409 --> 00:41:31.554
into the Union Jack,
a flag now familiar to us on

00:41:31.554 --> 00:41:35.320
the tops of mini-cars and on
swimming costumes.

00:41:35.320 --> 00:41:37.139
&gt;
 

00:41:37.139 --> 00:41:42.568
The Hanoverian succession to
the united throne was

00:41:42.568 --> 00:41:44.010
recognized.
 

00:41:44.010 --> 00:41:47.789
The Scots would join a single
parliament for the United

00:41:47.789 --> 00:41:50.099
Kingdom meeting in Westminster.
 

00:41:50.099 --> 00:41:53.342
Sixteen members would be sent
to the House of Lords,

00:41:53.342 --> 00:41:56.965
forty-five to the House of
Commons, in rough proportion to

00:41:56.965 --> 00:41:57.920
population.
 

00:41:57.920 --> 00:42:02.295
The Scottish legal system,
however, would retain its full

00:42:02.295 --> 00:42:04.639
jurisdictional independence.
 

00:42:04.639 --> 00:42:09.521
The Scottish church,
the Kirk, would also retain its

00:42:09.521 --> 00:42:13.349
independence as a Presbyterian
church.

00:42:13.349 --> 00:42:18.094
But fifteen of the twenty-five
articles of the Treaty of Union

00:42:18.094 --> 00:42:20.739
concerned economic arrangements.
 

00:42:20.739 --> 00:42:25.869
The Scots would be granted full
access to English trade.

00:42:25.869 --> 00:42:30.465
Lower taxes would be levied in
Scotland, because of the

00:42:30.465 --> 00:42:35.829
relative economic poverty of
Scotland as compared to England.

00:42:35.829 --> 00:42:40.219
Scotland's industries would be
protected.

00:42:40.219 --> 00:42:45.536
Substantial compensation would
be paid to those Scots who had

00:42:45.536 --> 00:42:49.967
lost heavily through their
investment in the Darien

00:42:49.967 --> 00:42:52.360
adventure of the 1690s.
 

00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:58.226
And so on the first of May,
1707, Scotland's Parliament

00:42:58.226 --> 00:43:03.012
dissolved itself,
not to meet again until the

00:43:03.012 --> 00:43:08.239
year 1999 when it was reinstated
as part of the current

00:43:08.239 --> 00:43:13.659
constitutional reconfiguration
of the United Kingdom.

00:43:13.659 --> 00:43:17.110
So the Union had taken place.
 

00:43:17.110 --> 00:43:21.500
Was it, one might ask,
a union of absorption,

00:43:21.500 --> 00:43:24.159
a union in which Scotland was
to be dominated by England,

00:43:24.159 --> 00:43:28.487
a union of absorption,
or was it to be a union of

00:43:28.487 --> 00:43:32.925
fusion,
one of cooperation rather than

00:43:32.925 --> 00:43:34.340
domination?
 

00:43:34.340 --> 00:43:40.400
Many Scots at the time feared
that it would be the former.

00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:44.480
In the long run I think it
turned out to be more the

00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:45.199
latter.
 

00:43:45.199 --> 00:43:49.264
Scots certainly proved to have
a quite disproportionately large

00:43:49.264 --> 00:43:51.168
role,
almost from the beginning of

00:43:51.168 --> 00:43:53.784
the Union,
in the running of the British

00:43:53.784 --> 00:43:55.179
Empire for example.
 

00:43:55.179 --> 00:43:59.038
But in the early eighteenth
century it was not yet quite

00:43:59.038 --> 00:43:59.670
either.
 

00:43:59.670 --> 00:44:03.668
England was not actually much
interested in dominating

00:44:03.668 --> 00:44:06.989
Scotland beyond the question of
security,

00:44:06.989 --> 00:44:12.103
and indeed Scottish affairs
remained largely in the hands of

00:44:12.103 --> 00:44:13.750
Scots themselves.
 

00:44:13.750 --> 00:44:17.452
Conversely, it took a while
before Scotland was able to

00:44:17.452 --> 00:44:20.880
fully exploit the economic
advantages of Union,

00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:24.983
though by the 1750s they were
indeed doing so very

00:44:24.983 --> 00:44:26.239
successfully.
 

00:44:26.239 --> 00:44:30.833
The emergence of Glasgow as one
of the major Atlantic ports is

00:44:30.833 --> 00:44:34.826
one of the biggest success
stories of that part of the

00:44:34.826 --> 00:44:35.579
Union.
 

00:44:35.579 --> 00:44:37.693
The Union then,
one could say,

00:44:37.693 --> 00:44:42.210
confirmed neither the fears nor
initially the full hopes of the

00:44:42.210 --> 00:44:44.469
Scots who had agreed to it.
 

00:44:44.469 --> 00:44:49.329
But from the English point of
view it had resolved a pressing

00:44:49.329 --> 00:44:53.543
security problem and it
completed the refashioning of

00:44:53.543 --> 00:44:57.998
the state which had been
introduced by the Revolution of

00:44:57.998 --> 00:44:58.889
1688.
 

00:44:58.889 --> 00:45:03.663
Culturally, there was an
England and a Scotland and a

00:45:03.663 --> 00:45:06.614
Wales,
as there still is,

00:45:06.614 --> 00:45:12.753
but politically by 1714 there
was what Jonathan Swift

00:45:12.753 --> 00:45:19.365
described as that "crazy
double-bottomed realm Great

00:45:19.365 --> 00:45:21.610
Britain."
 

00:45:21.610 --> 00:45:27.559
And crazy it was in many ways;
a monarchy which was actually

00:45:27.559 --> 00:45:32.675
run by a Parliament,
truly a monarchical republic,

00:45:32.675 --> 00:45:37.806
in which the king after 1701
actually had fewer powers than

00:45:37.806 --> 00:45:42.849
were later granted to presidents
of the United States.

00:45:42.849 --> 00:45:47.445
A confessional state and yet a
confessional state which

00:45:47.445 --> 00:45:51.018
actually had two established
religions,

00:45:51.018 --> 00:45:54.494
the Church of England in
England, the Presbyterian Church

00:45:54.494 --> 00:45:58.032
of Scotland in Scotland,
and which, by 1714,

00:45:58.032 --> 00:46:03.719
was headed by a king who was
actually a German Lutheran,

00:46:03.719 --> 00:46:08.153
but was an Anglican when he was
in England and a Presbyterian

00:46:08.153 --> 00:46:12.208
when he was in Scotland,
and meanwhile practicing

00:46:12.208 --> 00:46:17.530
greater religious freedom than
was tolerated by any other state

00:46:17.530 --> 00:46:19.590
save the Netherlands.
 

00:46:19.590 --> 00:46:24.849
An offshore island deeply
hostile to foreign involvement,

00:46:24.849 --> 00:46:30.362
deeply hostile to militarism,
and yet which was playing a key

00:46:30.362 --> 00:46:36.059
role in destroying the threat of
Louis XIV's monarchy and which

00:46:36.059 --> 00:46:39.920
had emerged as a great military
power.

00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:45.360
It was all very confusing,
but there it was.

00:46:45.360 --> 00:46:50.208
They had finally muddled
through to something that

00:46:50.208 --> 00:46:51.099
worked.
 

00:46:51.099 --> 00:46:56.000

00:00:01.233 --> 00:00:01.700
J. MICHAEL MCBRIDE: OK. 

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:04.333
So we're going to finish up on
nucleophilic substitution, 

00:00:04.333 --> 00:00:07.567
SN2, where we're spending so
much time looking at how you 

00:00:07.567 --> 00:00:08.733
prove a mechanism. 

00:00:08.733 --> 00:00:12.700
And then look at the
elimination, that's second 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.267
order, and then the substitution
and elimination 

00:00:15.267 --> 00:00:16.967
that are first order
kinetically. 

00:00:19.533 --> 00:00:23.333
We've looked at proving
mechanisms, that is disproving 

00:00:23.333 --> 00:00:27.933
mechanisms by stereochemistry,
by rate law, by rate constant, 

00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:30.867
varying all the different
components of the reaction. 

00:00:30.867 --> 00:00:34.067
And finally there's another way,
which is to look at 

00:00:34.067 --> 00:00:37.900
structure, which you can do
either with quantum mechanics 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.633
or by X-ray. 

00:00:44.033 --> 00:00:47.767
The problem, remember, is this
really subtle distinction, one 

00:00:47.767 --> 00:00:49.933
that probably doesn't make much
difference. 

00:00:49.933 --> 00:00:52.733
But if you're really looking
carefully at mechanism and 

00:00:52.733 --> 00:00:55.233
want to understand them it's an
interesting question, which 

00:00:55.233 --> 00:00:58.300
is, is there an energy minimum
at the top? 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:03.333
Is there an intermediate in the
concerted SN2 reaction, or 

00:01:03.333 --> 00:01:05.167
is it just a transition state? 

00:01:05.167 --> 00:01:09.867
And of course they blend into
one another as the stability 

00:01:09.867 --> 00:01:12.233
of the pentavalent intermediate,
if there were 

00:01:12.233 --> 00:01:17.000
one, gets less and less. 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.933
The interesting thing is when
you have the nucleophile, a 

00:01:19.933 --> 00:01:23.400
leaving group and a carbon in
the middle, trivalent carbon, 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.800
is it actually a pentavalent
carbon? 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.900
Is there some stability
associated with that? 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.033
You could imagine arranging
groups like oxygens, so there 

00:01:32.033 --> 00:01:35.267
are unshared pairs are on the
left and right, and a planar 

00:01:35.267 --> 00:01:38.100
carbon cation in the middle and
see whether 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.867
there's a bond there. 

00:01:39.867 --> 00:01:42.433
How are you going to get them? 

00:01:42.433 --> 00:01:46.267
Remember the non-bonded
distances between atoms, when 

00:01:46.267 --> 00:01:49.467
they're in contact, is about
twice as big as bonded 

00:01:49.467 --> 00:01:51.533
distances, right? 

00:01:51.533 --> 00:01:56.100
So if the thing is only
marginally stable, what's going

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.533
to keep it from flying apart? 

00:01:57.533 --> 00:02:00.467
How will that last long enough
for you to look at it? 

00:02:00.467 --> 00:02:03.633
Well, you can put other things
in a molecule that hold those 

00:02:03.633 --> 00:02:08.233
pieces in place, like this set
of three aromatic rings of the 

00:02:08.233 --> 00:02:10.500
anthracene system. 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.400
Now we've got the groups up
there on top where we want and

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.100
the question is going to be--

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.967
Well first, how do we get them
there? 

00:02:17.967 --> 00:02:21.633
The thing in the middle started
as an ester, right? 

00:02:21.633 --> 00:02:24.233
But we want it to be a cation
with a vacant p 

00:02:24.233 --> 00:02:26.000
orbital in the middle. 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.800
So what you do is react it with
a molecule we've talked 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.433
about before, Meerwein's
reagent, which is a way of 

00:02:32.433 --> 00:02:33.633
giving methyl groups. 

00:02:33.633 --> 00:02:35.500
It's got a great leaving group
on it. 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.500
A dimethyl ether is the leaving
group. 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.467
We can have a substitution
reaction and put a methyl 

00:02:42.467 --> 00:02:45.233
group on and now the carbon has
a positive charge. 

00:02:45.233 --> 00:02:48.100
Although if you want to be
careful about it, not all the 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.233
positive charge is on carbon
because the unshared pairs on 

00:02:52.233 --> 00:02:54.733
the adjacent oxygens, of course,
are mixing with that 

00:02:54.733 --> 00:02:57.433
vacant orbital. 

00:02:57.433 --> 00:03:01.700
We've got our trivalent carbon
cation in the middle. 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.167
There we see it. 

00:03:04.167 --> 00:03:08.500
There should be this anion that
was left from the 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.167
original Meerwein salt. 

00:03:10.167 --> 00:03:13.000
And the people who did the X-ray
work we're surprised to 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.733
find that it was not BF4 minus,
but B2F7 minus. 

00:03:18.733 --> 00:03:21.667
It had gotten together with
another BF3. 

00:03:21.667 --> 00:03:24.100
That's neither here nor there,
but it's what was 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.000
there in the crystal. 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.400
They have the oxygens next to
the central carbon. 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.867
And remember, calculated when
you had a cation with waters 

00:03:34.867 --> 00:03:39.967
on both sides of a trivalent
carbon, was that at the 

00:03:39.967 --> 00:03:44.800
symmetrical pentavalent, quote,
"geometry," it was a 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.333
transition state. 

00:03:46.333 --> 00:03:47.900
OK? 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.200
If you believed in the theory,
you wouldn't expect there to 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.633
be stability here now. 

00:03:52.633 --> 00:03:54.633
How do you know if there's
stability? 

00:03:54.633 --> 00:03:57.400
How do you know if there are
bonds there? 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.100
Well, you can look in the paper
that's cited down there 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.767
on the bottom right, and it
shows a picture and you can 

00:04:02.767 --> 00:04:05.867
see that indeed there are bonds
there. 

00:04:05.867 --> 00:04:07.800
Right? 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.833
That's supposed to engender a
laugh. 

00:04:09.833 --> 00:04:11.500
I see Chris smiling. 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.033
Why do you smile? 

00:04:13.033 --> 00:04:14.000
STUDENT: They just drew
the bonds.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.767
PROFESSOR: They just drew the
bonds, right? 

00:04:15.767 --> 00:04:17.967
How do you know there are bonds
there? 

00:04:17.967 --> 00:04:19.467
Well there's one interesting
thing. 

00:04:19.467 --> 00:04:23.133
This structure is symmetrical,
as drawn. 

00:04:23.133 --> 00:04:26.433
And, you notice these funny
shapes the atoms have. What 

00:04:26.433 --> 00:04:31.433
they are, are ellipses with an
octant cut out of them to show 

00:04:31.433 --> 00:04:33.433
the size of the axes. 

00:04:33.433 --> 00:04:36.267
And one thing you measure in
X-ray is how 

00:04:36.267 --> 00:04:40.233
much the atoms vibrate. 

00:04:40.233 --> 00:04:42.733
Those show how much it vibrates
in the three 

00:04:42.733 --> 00:04:46.200
principal directions for
vibration. 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:50.200
If we look at that C19, the
central carbon there, notice 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:51.433
it's not elongated. 

00:04:54.033 --> 00:04:58.200
It would be elongated if it
vibrated with great amplitude 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.567
back and forth. 

00:05:00.567 --> 00:05:03.133
It would move a lot in that
direction. 

00:05:03.133 --> 00:05:06.300
So it could be-- remember in
X-ray, what you see is the 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.033
average structure over many
molecules-- 

00:05:09.033 --> 00:05:11.833
it could have been that one of
them is like this another one 

00:05:11.833 --> 00:05:13.867
is like this, another one was
like this, 

00:05:13.867 --> 00:05:15.133
another is like this. 

00:05:15.133 --> 00:05:18.400
And the average would appear to
be in the middle. 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.400
But it would have a long
displacement, on the 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:22.800
average, you see. 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.367
But that's not what you see
there. 

00:05:24.367 --> 00:05:27.167
It could be like this bell
clapper or sometimes there, 

00:05:27.167 --> 00:05:29.800
sometimes there, but on average
in the middle. 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:34.233
But it's not because it's not
stretched out that way. 

00:05:34.233 --> 00:05:36.333
That still didn't answer the
question, whether they're 

00:05:36.333 --> 00:05:37.067
bonds there. 

00:05:37.067 --> 00:05:41.100
It could be in the middle, but
no bonds. 

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:45.733
So let's look right edge-on at
the central carbon. 

00:05:45.733 --> 00:05:50.133
And ask the question, how far
apart are those two oxygens? 

00:05:50.133 --> 00:05:55.200
If the interaction is repulsive
then they should 

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:56.267
move apart. 

00:05:56.267 --> 00:05:59.300
If it's attractive they should
move together. 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:00.967
Compared to what? 

00:06:00.967 --> 00:06:03.900
Well, the authors compared it
with the two carbons they were 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:08.833
attached to, which are 5.02
angstroms apart. 

00:06:08.833 --> 00:06:12.400
And the white is 4.86. 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.267
So, they've been drawn together.

00:06:14.267 --> 00:06:18.200
The distance is shortened by
0.16 angstoms, as if they're 

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:21.700
being sucked in. 

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:24.167
That looks like there's a
pentavalent carbon that's 

00:06:24.167 --> 00:06:27.133
actually attracting those
adjacent oxygens. 

00:06:27.133 --> 00:06:29.267
This was published in a
distinguished journal, the 

00:06:29.267 --> 00:06:31.633
Journal of the American Chemical
Society. 

00:06:31.633 --> 00:06:35.033
And notice that it's not only
that distance but you can see 

00:06:35.033 --> 00:06:38.333
also that the angles are
distorted. 

00:06:38.333 --> 00:06:41.600
Instead of those being 120
degree angles out on the left 

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:44.267
there, one of them is larger and
one of them 

00:06:44.267 --> 00:06:45.733
is 7 degrees smaller. 

00:06:45.733 --> 00:06:49.167
It's bent in, as if it's being
sucked by the central carbon, 

00:06:49.167 --> 00:06:50.700
so that there's a bond there. 

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:54.400
So pentavalence seemed to be a
safe inference, and that was 

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:57.300
the subject of this paper. 

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:02.167
But, if they did compared to
what, and just had hydrogen in 

00:07:02.167 --> 00:07:05.900
the middle instead of that
positive carbon, it turned out 

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:08.800
they were sucked in even
further. 

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:14.867
So instead of being 4.84,
whatever it is, it's 4.75 

00:07:14.867 --> 00:07:19.667
angstroms. So much for that
proof, that these groups are 

00:07:19.667 --> 00:07:21.233
being sucked in. 

00:07:21.233 --> 00:07:23.467
With nothing in the middle, just
the hydrogen, 

00:07:23.467 --> 00:07:25.667
they're sucked in? 

00:07:28.667 --> 00:07:32.533
Now, notice that there wasn't
just that 

00:07:32.533 --> 00:07:33.633
positive carbon there. 

00:07:33.633 --> 00:07:35.967
There were these other things,
the oxygens, and the methyls. 

00:07:35.967 --> 00:07:38.233
There was some space to that
which could have 

00:07:38.233 --> 00:07:41.133
pushed things apart. 

00:07:41.133 --> 00:07:46.333
Now lacking that push apart,
they come together closer. 

00:07:46.333 --> 00:07:49.267
From one point of view, that's
reasonable, but why should they

00:07:49.267 --> 00:07:50.367
come together? 

00:07:50.367 --> 00:07:53.333
It's not a pull to the central
carbon. 

00:07:53.333 --> 00:07:55.433
It seems to be a push. 

00:07:55.433 --> 00:07:57.133
Where is the push coming from? 

00:07:57.133 --> 00:07:58.400
Can anybody see? 

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:07.967
What pushes those methoxy
groups, the oxygens, toward 

00:08:07.967 --> 00:08:10.400
the center? 

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:11.767
Helen? 

00:08:11.767 --> 00:08:12.633
STUDENT: Maybe it's the steric
hinderance or the strain of 

00:08:12.633 --> 00:08:13.867
the two methyls. 

00:08:17.233 --> 00:08:21.200
PROFESSOR: What are the methyls
being pushed by? 

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:22.433
STUDENT: ... 

00:08:24.933 --> 00:08:30.267
PROFESSOR: It must be some push
to bend those angles in. 

00:08:30.267 --> 00:08:32.067
Anybody got an idea? 

00:08:32.067 --> 00:08:32.400
Chris? 

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:33.800
STUDENT: Is it with the
hydrogens? 

00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:35.633
PROFESSOR: Ah, the hydrogens. 

00:08:35.633 --> 00:08:36.667
Right? 

00:08:36.667 --> 00:08:37.767
They're eclipsed. 

00:08:37.767 --> 00:08:42.200
And there's repulsion there that
causes them to bend in. 

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:46.533
Now, you can put instead of a
positive carbon, you can put 

00:08:46.533 --> 00:08:49.867
oxygen in the middle with this
extra group on it. 

00:08:49.867 --> 00:08:53.667
And that, you see, does push
them further apart. 

00:08:53.667 --> 00:08:57.167
But still they're bent in a
little bit as 

00:08:57.167 --> 00:08:59.100
compared to the carbon. 

00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:03.267
But the central oxygen is only
slightly repulsive, compared 

00:09:03.267 --> 00:09:03.933
to the carbon. 

00:09:03.933 --> 00:09:06.333
So the carbon's not pulling
things in at all. 

00:09:06.333 --> 00:09:09.900
It's pushing them out trying to
fight against that hydrogen 

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:13.967
pushing into the methyl out on
the side. 

00:09:13.967 --> 00:09:17.767
If you have BF3 in the middle,
which clearly has the vacant 

00:09:17.767 --> 00:09:21.667
orbital on boron, has very small
other things on the 

00:09:21.667 --> 00:09:24.133
boron, so they're not pushing
apart. 

00:09:24.133 --> 00:09:27.633
And those other things are
fluorine, so not only are they 

00:09:27.633 --> 00:09:30.500
small, but they're withdrawing
electrons and making that B 

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:33.167
orbital especially low in
energy. 

00:09:33.167 --> 00:09:38.567
Then you can see them genuinely
being sucked in, 

00:09:38.567 --> 00:09:43.700
further than in any of the other
cases, as compared there 

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:46.967
to the positive carbon in the
middle. 

00:09:46.967 --> 00:09:51.367
Now, if you try to make the
things on the outside more 

00:09:51.367 --> 00:09:54.167
willing to give up their
electrons, that is higher 

00:09:54.167 --> 00:09:58.000
HOMOs to make stronger bonds,
and make it O 

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.567
minus rather than CH3O. 

00:10:01.567 --> 00:10:04.933
So we have the minus charge
raising those HOMOs. 

00:10:04.933 --> 00:10:08.500
Then indeed, it forms a bond,
but not two bonds. 

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:09.767
It's unsymmetrical. 

00:10:12.533 --> 00:10:15.067
One of them is a reasonable
bond. 

00:10:15.067 --> 00:10:19.067
The other one is just a
non-bonded interaction. 

00:10:19.067 --> 00:10:22.000
In fact it turns out that this
is a salt. 

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.700
It's an anion. 

00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:28.467
So there's a positive cation
nearby, a potassium, which 

00:10:28.467 --> 00:10:30.100
makes it a little bit
unsymmetrical. 

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:33.033
So it's better to have the minus
charge on the right near 

00:10:33.033 --> 00:10:35.767
the potassium cation than on the
left. 

00:10:35.767 --> 00:10:39.100
That also helps distort it. 

00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:42.733
Now remember that as compared to
the anion that was 

00:10:42.733 --> 00:10:46.833
calculated, which again, was
said to be by calculation a 

00:10:46.833 --> 00:10:48.100
transition state. 

00:10:50.933 --> 00:10:53.267
Here are a whole bunch of things
they studied, and I 

00:10:53.267 --> 00:10:54.833
don't want to spend the time
going through 

00:10:54.833 --> 00:10:56.133
this in great detail. 

00:10:56.133 --> 00:10:57.667
But compared to what? 

00:10:57.667 --> 00:11:01.200
Compared to just having a
hydrogen in the middle-- to see

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:03.033
what these distances are. 

00:11:03.033 --> 00:11:06.133
Then in the case where C+ was in
the middle-- 

00:11:06.133 --> 00:11:11.033
they made the C+ that way-- but
it's not such a great C+ 

00:11:11.033 --> 00:11:15.733
because of the vacant orbital on
the carbon being mixed with 

00:11:15.733 --> 00:11:19.100
the unshared pairs on the
adjacent oxygens. 

00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:20.367
But if you have-- 

00:11:23.733 --> 00:11:27.600
if the central atom is bonded to
oxygen or sulfur, which has 

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:30.467
these extra electrons, that
seems to use 

00:11:30.467 --> 00:11:32.233
up the vacant orbital. 

00:11:32.233 --> 00:11:34.233
So it's not so good at bonding
and therefore 

00:11:34.233 --> 00:11:36.000
sucking things in. 

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.867
If you have fluorine on boron
then, as we said, the electron 

00:11:40.867 --> 00:11:44.133
withdrawal lowers the energy and
indeed it does seem to 

00:11:44.133 --> 00:11:45.433
suck it in to give a 

00:11:45.433 --> 00:11:47.500
pentavalent atom in the middle.

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:52.833
But if you have higher HOMOs on
the neighbor of the boron, 

00:11:52.833 --> 00:11:56.733
giving their electrons to the
boron, then that's a better 

00:11:56.733 --> 00:11:59.200
source of electrons for the
boron than the 

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:00.833
neighboring atoms are. 

00:12:00.833 --> 00:12:03.500
And you can see in these cases.

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:06.167
If you look at this whole bunch
of things plotted in 

00:12:06.167 --> 00:12:10.200
this particular way, you can
see, for example, there's 

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:14.000
boron with two chlorines in the
middle and methoxides on 

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.633
both sides. 

00:12:15.633 --> 00:12:19.500
The bar then shows the two
different bond distances. 

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:20.733
So it's unsymmetrical. 

00:12:20.733 --> 00:12:22.233
One is short, one is long. 

00:12:22.233 --> 00:12:25.133
It's not a pentavalent carbon. 

00:12:25.133 --> 00:12:27.400
There's some that are like that
on the right, very 

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:29.300
different and unsymmetrical. 

00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:32.433
Then there's some on the left
that are about equal bond 

00:12:32.433 --> 00:12:36.833
distances, right and left or
symmetrical. 

00:12:36.833 --> 00:12:40.800
There's our reference with
hydrogen in the middle. 

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:45.667
And it's pressed in to give
somewhat short distances by 

00:12:45.667 --> 00:12:48.433
the hydrogen pushing on the
methyl as 

00:12:48.433 --> 00:12:50.200
we spoke about before. 

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:52.700
If you have boron in the middle
it's not 

00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:55.367
sucked in very much. 

00:12:55.367 --> 00:12:59.767
Unless you have that case with
fluorine on the boron, and then

00:12:59.767 --> 00:13:02.700
it attracts enough that you
could make a pentavalent atom 

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:05.000
in the middle. 

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.933
But most of the borons are
tetracoordinate, that is 

00:13:08.933 --> 00:13:15.100
unsymmetrical not a single
minimum but a double minimum. 

00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:18.933
If you look at the two cases of
carbon, the one with 

00:13:18.933 --> 00:13:24.367
oxygens on each side there on
the left, is 

00:13:24.367 --> 00:13:27.433
symmetrical but not short. 

00:13:27.433 --> 00:13:32.067
And the one on the right is
short, one of them is short, 

00:13:32.067 --> 00:13:33.133
but the other is long. 

00:13:33.133 --> 00:13:34.567
It's not symmetrical. 

00:13:34.567 --> 00:13:39.933
There's no sign from this
exercise for a pentavalent 

00:13:39.933 --> 00:13:43.300
intermediate of the SN2 sort
being stable. 

00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:47.967
It seems genuinely to be just a
maximum on the way across. 

00:13:50.967 --> 00:13:53.567
So it's a transition state as
calculated by quantum 

00:13:53.567 --> 00:13:56.867
mechanics, so that should give
us a little more confidence, 

00:13:56.867 --> 00:14:00.133
perhaps, in the reliability of
quantum mechanics, which of 

00:14:00.133 --> 00:14:03.367
course, can't take into account
all the neighbors 

00:14:03.367 --> 00:14:04.633
around the molecule. 

00:14:07.833 --> 00:14:10.200
That's as far as we're going to
go looking at the mechanism 

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:11.500
of the SN2. 

00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:14.900
Now we're going to look at
alternative paths of reaction, 

00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:17.500
the elimination reaction, which
we already mentioned 

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:21.600
last semester and also first
order nucleophilic 

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:23.600
substitution and elimination. 

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:27.467
First E2, or beta-elimination. 

00:14:27.467 --> 00:14:30.167
Now, this is from last semester.

00:14:30.167 --> 00:14:33.700
You remember, you can attack
here with a high HOMO, 

00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:35.333
antibonding here, antibonding
here. 

00:14:35.333 --> 00:14:36.500
You break off flouride. 

00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:39.600
You break off hydrogen, and form
the carbon-carbon bond, 

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:41.467
as shown by the curved arrows
here. 

00:14:41.467 --> 00:14:43.467
We said last semester that
that's the 

00:14:43.467 --> 00:14:45.033
E2 elimination mechanism. 

00:14:47.667 --> 00:14:50.167
What influences the rate? 

00:14:50.167 --> 00:14:53.300
The rate is influenced by the
base. 

00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:55.233
That's what makes it second
order. 

00:14:55.233 --> 00:14:57.700
It depends not only on the
concentration of this 

00:14:57.700 --> 00:15:02.267
substrate but also on the
concentration of hydroxide. 

00:15:02.267 --> 00:15:05.300
The two must be getting together
in the rate-limiting 

00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:08.467
step, or before the
rate-limiting step in a 

00:15:08.467 --> 00:15:11.700
preliminary equilibrium that
gets drawn off. 

00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:15.533
That's the same thinking as we
had on the SN2, that both 

00:15:15.533 --> 00:15:18.600
things are involved in the
rate-limiting, or before, the 

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:20.300
rate-limiting step. 

00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:22.467
It depends on the nature of the
leaving group. 

00:15:22.467 --> 00:15:25.000
A better leaving group reacts
faster. 

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.733
So that means that the fluoride
is leaving in the 

00:15:28.733 --> 00:15:33.233
rate-limiting step, or before
the rate-limiting step in a 

00:15:33.233 --> 00:15:35.267
pre-equilibrium. 

00:15:35.267 --> 00:15:39.533
There's a hydrogen isotope
effect, called a kinetic 

00:15:39.533 --> 00:15:40.567
isotope effect. 

00:15:40.567 --> 00:15:44.833
If you change hydrogen for
deuterium, you change the rate,

00:15:44.833 --> 00:15:47.633
and this has special
implication, 

00:15:47.633 --> 00:15:48.933
as you can see here. 

00:15:48.933 --> 00:15:52.433
These others only meant it was
at the transition state, or 

00:15:52.433 --> 00:15:55.867
before the transition state,
that something was happening. 

00:15:55.867 --> 00:15:59.333
But if this makes a difference
it shows that bond is being 

00:15:59.333 --> 00:16:03.800
broken during the transition
state. 

00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:05.633
We know the leaving group is
leaving, 

00:16:05.633 --> 00:16:09.767
we know the base is
coming in, those

00:16:09.767 --> 00:16:11.433
two things either
before or at the

00:16:11.433 --> 00:16:14.767
transition state, and now we
know the hydrogen is leaving 

00:16:14.767 --> 00:16:19.267
at the transition state, and
let's see how that works. 

00:16:19.267 --> 00:16:22.633
We saw in "Erwin Meets
Goldilocks that you have a 

00:16:22.633 --> 00:16:25.433
vibrational potential surface. 

00:16:25.433 --> 00:16:28.967
And you'd have also a
vibrational potential surface 

00:16:28.967 --> 00:16:31.267
for the hydrogen that's being
transferred after it's 

00:16:31.267 --> 00:16:31.867
transferred. 

00:16:31.867 --> 00:16:34.800
It's stuck first place to the
carbon, in the second place to 

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:37.100
the oxygen. 

00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:40.600
But halfway across, when the
bond is being broken, it's 

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:43.867
between the two so it's not
being bound to either. 

00:16:43.867 --> 00:16:45.600
It's very low-- 

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:47.500
It's easy to move back and forth
when 

00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:50.100
it's halfway between. 

00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:54.600
What implication does this have
for the kinetic energy of 

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:56.233
that hydrogen? 

00:16:56.233 --> 00:16:58.900
Remember, there's a lowest
possible kinetic energy, the 

00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:04.867
one that gives no nodes in the
wave. It'll be here in that 

00:17:04.867 --> 00:17:09.200
case, here in the oxygen case,
but when it's very easy to 

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:13.467
move you can stretch the wave
way out, very little 

00:17:13.467 --> 00:17:16.467
curvature, very little kinetic
energy. 

00:17:16.467 --> 00:17:20.433
So you can have much lower
minimum kinetic energy when 

00:17:20.433 --> 00:17:23.700
the hydrogen bond is being
broken than when it's either 

00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:28.533
attached to the carbon or
attached to the oxygen. 

00:17:28.533 --> 00:17:30.567
What's the implication of that?

00:17:30.567 --> 00:17:33.167
When you do the reaction you
have to get to the transition 

00:17:33.167 --> 00:17:35.333
state so you have to put in that
much energy. 

00:17:38.067 --> 00:17:40.600
What's the implication if we
change 

00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:41.833
from hydrogen to deuterium? 

00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:50.767
You remember what happens when
you change the mass in "Erwin 

00:17:50.767 --> 00:17:53.767
Meets Goldilocks to the lowest
energy? 

00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:02.600
If you make them into
deuteriums, then you have a 

00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:07.100
wave that looks like this, but
the bigger mass means it has 

00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:08.333
lower energy. 

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:16.033
So, we have lower energy here,
lower energy here, and lower 

00:18:16.033 --> 00:18:19.833
energy here, but it can't be
lower than the minimum. 

00:18:19.833 --> 00:18:22.500
There's hardly any change in the
energy here, when you go 

00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:25.733
from hydrogen to deuterium, but
there's a substantial change 

00:18:25.733 --> 00:18:27.567
here and a substantial change
here. 

00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:32.733
If you look at the energy that's
required for the 

00:18:32.733 --> 00:18:36.133
reaction, more energy is
required for the deuterium, 

00:18:36.133 --> 00:18:38.467
because it started lower. 

00:18:38.467 --> 00:18:41.533
If you were talking about an
equilibrium between here and 

00:18:41.533 --> 00:18:45.267
here, then that difference would
cancel out. 

00:18:45.267 --> 00:18:48.667
It's only in that transition
stage, which has the very low 

00:18:48.667 --> 00:18:52.967
potential, that means that
there's something special 

00:18:52.967 --> 00:18:55.733
about the deuterium, or perhaps
you should say 

00:18:55.733 --> 00:18:58.767
something NOT special about the
deuterium. 

00:18:58.767 --> 00:19:01.867
When it's bonded, it's unusually
low in energy, but 

00:19:01.867 --> 00:19:03.800
when it's not tightly bonded,
then it has the 

00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:05.067
same energy as hydrogen. 

00:19:07.367 --> 00:19:11.033
Because you have more of a
barrier for deuterium, the 

00:19:11.033 --> 00:19:13.600
reaction should be slower. 

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:17.767
Hydrogen is faster than
deuterium if that is the 

00:19:17.767 --> 00:19:19.667
rate-limiting step. 

00:19:19.667 --> 00:19:22.133
If that's not the rate-limiting
step, if it 

00:19:22.133 --> 00:19:28.200
happens before this or after
this, then you don't have the 

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:30.433
difference between hydrogen and
deuterium. 

00:19:30.433 --> 00:19:35.133
It's only when the hydrogen is
being broken away during the 

00:19:35.133 --> 00:19:38.533
transition state, during the
rate-determining step, that 

00:19:38.533 --> 00:19:40.067
you can see it. 

00:19:40.067 --> 00:19:43.700
You get that difference in
rates, that so-called kinetic 

00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:47.467
isotope effect, only if bond is
being weakened in the 

00:19:47.467 --> 00:19:51.100
rate-determining transition
state. 

00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:54.600
There's another interesting
implication as there was in 

00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:58.700
SN2, which is stereochemistry. 

00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:01.200
So we have a hydrogen and a
leaving group that are going 

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:02.767
to come off. 

00:20:02.767 --> 00:20:04.767
And if we look at that from the
end with the Newman 

00:20:04.767 --> 00:20:07.433
projection, we see them anti to
one another. 

00:20:07.433 --> 00:20:10.833
We can imagine pulling the two
off and forming a bond by 

00:20:10.833 --> 00:20:12.033
what's left. 

00:20:12.033 --> 00:20:14.800
They could've been syn to one
another in an eclipsed 

00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:16.367
conformation. 

00:20:16.367 --> 00:20:18.000
Which should be better? 

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.067
Should we pull them off anti to
one another 

00:20:21.067 --> 00:20:23.800
or syn to one another? 

00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:26.833
Well of course, the top
conformation 

00:20:26.833 --> 00:20:31.133
would involve eclipsing. 

00:20:31.133 --> 00:20:34.233
So that would be higher in
energy than the anti. 

00:20:34.233 --> 00:20:37.400
And furthermore it turns out,
although we don't have time to 

00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:42.100
talk about it right now, that
anti orbitals overlap with one 

00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:45.333
another better than syn
orbitals. 

00:20:45.333 --> 00:20:47.333
To me, that seems
counterintuitive. 

00:20:47.333 --> 00:20:49.433
You'd think when they're like
this, they'd overlap better 

00:20:49.433 --> 00:20:51.000
than when they're like that. 

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.867
But in fact they overlap better
when they're anti. 

00:20:53.867 --> 00:20:58.667
By both accounts, one would
expect the anti to be the 

00:20:58.667 --> 00:21:02.267
preferred mode for elimination.

00:21:02.267 --> 00:21:03.600
But is it true? 

00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:06.200
How could you test it
experimentally? 

00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:09.100
How could you tell whether they
had been pulled off, or 

00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:12.233
were being pulled off, from the
same side or 

00:21:12.233 --> 00:21:13.500
from opposite sides? 

00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:19.133
Well, if you look at the title
of the slide you use 

00:21:19.133 --> 00:21:20.400
stereochemistry. 

00:21:25.833 --> 00:21:39.233
Notice then, that if we put R
groups on here, then when we 

00:21:39.233 --> 00:21:43.433
lose H and L here these two R's
will be on the same side. 

00:21:43.433 --> 00:21:46.000
But if it's rotated into this
form, then they'll be on 

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.767
opposite sides of the new double
bond that's being made 

00:21:48.767 --> 00:21:51.433
across the middle. 

00:21:51.433 --> 00:21:54.567
We can start, for syn
elimination of this particular 

00:21:54.567 --> 00:21:58.967
compound, where notice this
configuration is S and that 

00:21:58.967 --> 00:22:03.667
one also is S. It's rotated into
a conformation where the 

00:22:03.667 --> 00:22:07.100
leaving groups are syn to one
another. 

00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:08.800
Of course it could rotate, and
they could 

00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:10.833
be anti to one another. 

00:22:10.833 --> 00:22:15.500
And the question is, which one
really happens? 

00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:19.433
We can look at the product and
find that the two methyls are 

00:22:19.433 --> 00:22:22.367
on the same side of the double
bond as they are 

00:22:22.367 --> 00:22:23.700
here, both in back. 

00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:27.867
Where as here, one's in front,
the other's in back. 

00:22:27.867 --> 00:22:31.400
This suggests then that the fact
that one gets the E 

00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:36.933
isomer of the alkene that it was
the anti form that gave 

00:22:36.933 --> 00:22:38.033
rise to it. 

00:22:38.033 --> 00:22:40.767
Stereochemistry showed that it's
anti 

00:22:40.767 --> 00:22:43.000
elimination in this case. 

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.167
Of course there could have been
another reason for anti 

00:22:45.167 --> 00:22:46.533
elimination. 

00:22:46.533 --> 00:22:50.133
It could've been that this
product is more stable than 

00:22:50.133 --> 00:22:52.433
the one where the phenyl group
is near the methyl. 

00:22:55.233 --> 00:22:58.833
How can we discriminate whether
it's just that it's 

00:22:58.833 --> 00:23:02.533
the preferred conformation and
anti is good for the reason 

00:23:02.533 --> 00:23:05.667
shown here, or whether the only
reason you get that one 

00:23:05.667 --> 00:23:07.467
is because it's more stable? 

00:23:07.467 --> 00:23:09.367
Can anybody see how you can test
that? 

00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:17.700
You could use a different
stereochemistry on the 

00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:23.033
starting material and see if it
still gives that one. 

00:23:23.033 --> 00:23:28.467
So maybe E is just more stable
than the Z isomer. 

00:23:28.467 --> 00:23:31.200
Here we can change the
configuration on the right to 

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:35.033
make it R. The methyl is now in
back and the hydrogen in 

00:23:35.033 --> 00:23:37.533
front here. 

00:23:37.533 --> 00:23:40.000
So now the syn is the one
that should give

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.667
the E isomer,
and the anti

00:23:42.667 --> 00:23:49.600
should give the Z. In fact, you
see it is Z. So no matter 

00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:51.067
which way-- 

00:23:51.067 --> 00:23:54.700
it can't be just because this
one is more stable, because if 

00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:57.867
you change it you get that one.

00:23:57.867 --> 00:24:02.667
It has to be that it favors the
anti conformation for the 

00:24:02.667 --> 00:24:03.933
elimination. 

00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:11.533
There's anti stereochemistry but
nature is not dogmatic 

00:24:11.533 --> 00:24:12.533
about this. 

00:24:12.533 --> 00:24:19.000
If you can't do the anti, then
the syn is still OK. 

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:25.300
And here's an example of that
taken from the Jones textbook. 

00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:29.233
Notice that in this case, the
treatment with base to 

00:24:29.233 --> 00:24:31.967
eliminate hydrogen or deuterium
from this side and 

00:24:31.967 --> 00:24:36.100
tosylate from that side, removes
the deuterium, leaving 

00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:37.733
two hydrogens. 

00:24:37.733 --> 00:24:43.500
It gives that a 98% yield even
though those two are required 

00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:47.167
to be syn to one another
because, again, this bicyclic 

00:24:47.167 --> 00:24:50.900
framework, the same one used by
Bartlett and Knox, that idea 

00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:56.367
of holding things in place that
way, doesn't allow 

00:24:56.367 --> 00:24:58.433
conformational change around
here. 

00:24:58.433 --> 00:25:01.967
So these have to be syn to one
another. 

00:25:01.967 --> 00:25:07.833
It loses DOTs not HOTs despite
the kinetic isotope effect. 

00:25:07.833 --> 00:25:10.633
Remember hydrogen is eliminated
in preference to 

00:25:10.633 --> 00:25:14.067
deuterium, other things being
equal. 

00:25:14.067 --> 00:25:16.433
Other things aren't equal as you
can look here. 

00:25:16.433 --> 00:25:19.600
If you do a sort of semi-Newman
projection along 

00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:24.400
this bond you can see the D and
OTs, their bonds are in 

00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:25.833
the same plane. 

00:25:25.833 --> 00:25:30.300
So in this rigid, eclipsed case
the overlap of sigma-star 

00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:34.300
here, which is losing its
electrons 

00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:36.800
that is, as the OTs minus leaves

00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:40.200
this vacant orbital is able to
overlap well and stabilize the 

00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:43.933
sigma orbitals in this bond, so
it takes away those 

00:25:43.933 --> 00:25:46.133
electrons and D+ leaves. 

00:25:46.133 --> 00:25:51.800
So, the eclipsed D is better
than H which would be better 

00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:53.333
if it could be anti. 

00:25:53.333 --> 00:25:55.900
But this framework doesn't allow
it to be anti. 

00:25:55.900 --> 00:25:58.900
There's not good overlap between
the H and the OTs. 

00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:00.200
It's anticlinal. 

00:26:02.067 --> 00:26:05.000
Notice in this case you don't
have to pay a penalty for 

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.200
having the starting
material for the

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:09.433
syn elimination eclipsed. 

00:26:09.433 --> 00:26:13.200
It's required to be eclipsed by
the nature of the linkage 

00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:14.433
among the carbons. 

00:26:16.967 --> 00:26:20.267
That's a question of
stereochemistry, whether you 

00:26:20.267 --> 00:26:23.700
get E or Z isomer. 

00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:26.733
There's also a question of
what's called regiochemistry. 

00:26:26.733 --> 00:26:29.333
Where does the double bond
appear? 

00:26:29.333 --> 00:26:32.033
If the leaving group is here on
the second carbon, and you 

00:26:32.033 --> 00:26:36.400
treat it with base to remove H
and L, then you can get the 

00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:40.200
double bond either in this
position, or in this position. 

00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:42.733
And that can be both cis and
trans. 

00:26:42.733 --> 00:26:47.067
I draw only the trans isomer. 

00:26:47.067 --> 00:26:50.767
You could remove a blue hydrogen
or a red hydrogen. 

00:26:50.767 --> 00:26:53.700
And this is the kind of thing,
where before people knew 

00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:57.500
anything about mechanism, people
tried to figure out how 

00:26:57.500 --> 00:27:02.400
you can get a certain product
and different pathways. 

00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:04.067
This was just lore: 

00:27:04.067 --> 00:27:05.033
this would do this: 

00:27:05.033 --> 00:27:06.467
this would do this. 

00:27:06.467 --> 00:27:08.467
There were two kinds of rules. 

00:27:08.467 --> 00:27:10.967
One was the rule due the
Hofmann. 

00:27:10.967 --> 00:27:14.567
The other was the rule due to
Saytzeff. 

00:27:14.567 --> 00:27:18.467
So there was the Saytzeff rule,
which said you should take off 

00:27:18.467 --> 00:27:20.100
the blue hydrogen. 

00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:23.233
And there was the Hofmann rule
that you should take off the 

00:27:23.233 --> 00:27:25.633
red hydrogen. 

00:27:25.633 --> 00:27:28.967
Some cases did one, and some
cases did the other. 

00:27:28.967 --> 00:27:32.100
And it was your business if you
were a synthetic chemist 

00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:35.300
to know which ones did which, so
you would know what kind of 

00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:40.500
leaving group to choose or what
kind of base to choose to 

00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:44.300
get the particular products you
were desirous of. 

00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:46.967
If you have the leaving group of
the halogens, iodine, 

00:27:46.967 --> 00:27:49.433
bromine, chlorine, you see
they're Saytzeff. 

00:27:49.433 --> 00:27:54.333
The dominant isomer you get is
in the second position not the 

00:27:54.333 --> 00:27:56.500
terminal position. 

00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:59.600
But notice as we go iodine,
bromine, chlorine it gets less 

00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:01.600
and less Saytzeff. 

00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:05.100
In fact if you go to fluoride it
turns around and it becomes 

00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:08.500
Hofmann in its orientation. 

00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:12.333
The same is true for the leaving
group being 

00:28:12.333 --> 00:28:13.833
trimethylamine. 

00:28:13.833 --> 00:28:20.300
The trimethyl ammonium starting
material loses this 

00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:26.467
trimethylamine and this proton,
so it's 98% of Hofmann 

00:28:26.467 --> 00:28:27.633
orientation. 

00:28:29.567 --> 00:28:32.467
This big group seems to be
Hofmann. 

00:28:32.467 --> 00:28:35.667
Iodide seems to be Saytzeff. 

00:28:35.667 --> 00:28:38.000
Let's look a little bit about
the energetics that are 

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.233
involved here. 

00:28:40.233 --> 00:28:42.333
This is a ratio of about 4:1. 

00:28:42.333 --> 00:28:44.567
This is about 1:50. 

00:28:44.567 --> 00:28:48.067
The whole range, which is very
important, what you're 

00:28:48.067 --> 00:28:52.367
going to be getting, is only a
factor of 200 

00:28:52.367 --> 00:28:54.867
between 4:1 and 1:50. 

00:28:54.867 --> 00:29:00.300
So 400 means a factor of 10^2.3,
which means that it's 

00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:04.133
about three kilocalories change
in energy that makes it 

00:29:04.133 --> 00:29:08.900
from going 4:1 one way, to 50:1
the other way. 

00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:11.400
A change of just three
kilocalories. 

00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:12.633
Remember that a hydrogen bond--

00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:17.733
not a particularly strong
hydrogen bond--is worth three 

00:29:17.733 --> 00:29:18.733
kilocalories. 

00:29:18.733 --> 00:29:20.867
So you can see that subtle
things are going 

00:29:20.867 --> 00:29:23.333
to enter into this. 

00:29:23.333 --> 00:29:27.933
It's not surprising that there
are not hard and fast rules, 

00:29:27.933 --> 00:29:33.200
that sometimes it's Saytzeff and
sometimes it's Hofmann. 

00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:34.400
This is a very subtle thing. 

00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:39.633
It's important for synthesis,
but it's not a big factor that 

00:29:39.633 --> 00:29:41.800
you could be confident, that you
could put your finger on 

00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:44.000
it and say that's the reason it
went that way. 

00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:50.267
You can have E2 versus SN2. 

00:29:50.267 --> 00:29:53.400
You could have the high HOMO
come in, either attack a 

00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:55.433
carbon or take a hydrogen. 

00:29:55.433 --> 00:29:59.800
How well do we understand what
does that? 

00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:01.033
Suppose we take t-butyl. 

00:30:03.967 --> 00:30:07.267
To do an SN2 reaction you'd have
to attack there, but 

00:30:07.267 --> 00:30:09.333
we've seen this picture before
and you know 

00:30:09.333 --> 00:30:10.733
that's sterically hindered. 

00:30:10.733 --> 00:30:12.333
You can't get in there. 

00:30:12.333 --> 00:30:19.100
Steric hindrance tends to
disfavor SN2 processes. 

00:30:19.100 --> 00:30:23.800
But it's much easier to get to
the neighboring hydrogen and 

00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:24.533
pull it off. 

00:30:24.533 --> 00:30:26.767
It's on the surface of the
molecule. 

00:30:26.767 --> 00:30:31.100
Steric hindrance favors E2 over
SN2. 

00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:34.000
It does it by disfavoring SN2. 

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.467
If you have a very hindered
center, you tend to get 

00:30:36.467 --> 00:30:39.467
elimination, not substitution. 

00:30:39.467 --> 00:30:41.467
That makes perfect sense. 

00:30:41.467 --> 00:30:46.733
Furthermore, remember when we
looked at nucleophilicity, how 

00:30:46.733 --> 00:30:50.267
good things are at attacking
carbon, we tried to see 

00:30:50.267 --> 00:30:53.400
whether it would be the same as
attacking hydrogen. 

00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:57.167
There wasn't such good
parallelism. Some things were 

00:30:57.167 --> 00:31:01.700
more dramatic in their pKa in
attacking hydrogen than they 

00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:04.833
were in attacking carbon. 

00:31:04.833 --> 00:31:07.867
That obviously means that if you
take something that's a 

00:31:07.867 --> 00:31:12.867
fairly weak nucleophile,
compared to how basic it is, 

00:31:12.867 --> 00:31:17.100
the pKa, if you look at those
which are grossly out of whack,

00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:20.500
then they could be ones that
would prefer 

00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:22.067
attacking the hydrogen. 

00:31:22.067 --> 00:31:24.733
For example, hydroxide is of
that case. 

00:31:24.733 --> 00:31:28.400
It's a strong base but not as
good a nucleophile as you 

00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:30.433
would expect for such a strong
base. 

00:31:30.433 --> 00:31:34.700
So hydroxide, or alkoxide, tends
to do elimination rather 

00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:36.300
than substitution. 

00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:39.367
But always these are a balancing
act and it could depend on 

00:31:39.367 --> 00:31:40.700
other factors as well. 

00:31:46.433 --> 00:31:51.533
I've given the title of these
next things Synthesis Games 

00:31:51.533 --> 00:31:57.100
because synthesis is for many
people the real goal of 

00:31:57.100 --> 00:32:01.300
organic chemistry is how to make
new molecules, or make 

00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:02.967
old molecules in better ways. 

00:32:08.633 --> 00:32:12.933
One of the best ways is to
follow lore. 

00:32:12.933 --> 00:32:15.000
But it's also guided by
understanding. 

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:20.000
There has been lots of progress
made in the last 

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:23.967
fifty years because of people
having studied mechanism. 

00:32:23.967 --> 00:32:26.867
If something isn't going right
you have some idea what you 

00:32:26.867 --> 00:32:30.933
might change in order to make
it, not just looking up in the 

00:32:30.933 --> 00:32:34.200
literature to see what people
did before, although that 

00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:37.033
remains a very important
procedure. 

00:32:37.033 --> 00:32:40.533
We saw all these different
nucleophilic substitution 

00:32:40.533 --> 00:32:43.400
reactions, and the question then
if you're trying to apply 

00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:47.333
somebody else's work to yours,
is how general they are. 

00:32:47.333 --> 00:32:49.667
For example, the Williamson
ether synthesis, 

00:32:49.667 --> 00:32:51.467
how general is it? 

00:32:51.467 --> 00:32:54.267
For example here's the compound,
MTBE. 

00:32:54.267 --> 00:32:56.200
Have you ever heard of that? 

00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:59.733
I bet you've seen the word. 

00:32:59.733 --> 00:33:01.567
Or the acronym. 

00:33:01.567 --> 00:33:04.333
It's methyl t-butyl ether. 

00:33:04.333 --> 00:33:07.533
Have you ever seen MTBE? 

00:33:07.533 --> 00:33:10.167
Where did you see it? 

00:33:10.167 --> 00:33:10.367
STUDENTS: Lab. 

00:33:10.367 --> 00:33:11.600
PROFESSOR: On the gasoline pump.

00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:15.200
This is an additive to gasoline.

00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:19.067
So it's made in enormous
quantities. 

00:33:19.067 --> 00:33:21.800
Here, you want to make this
ether. 

00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:22.733
Here's a way to do it. 

00:33:22.733 --> 00:33:27.567
You can start with methanol,
treat it with sodium hydride. 

00:33:27.567 --> 00:33:31.667
There is a high HOMO which can
attack the proton and take it 

00:33:31.667 --> 00:33:35.333
away as H2, leaving the sodium
salt of methoxide. 

00:33:35.333 --> 00:33:37.333
We have a nucleophile. 

00:33:37.333 --> 00:33:40.333
Now if we want to make this bond
here, the one between the 

00:33:40.333 --> 00:33:43.533
oxygen and the tertiary carbon,
then we would react it 

00:33:43.533 --> 00:33:46.367
with t-butyl bromide. 

00:33:46.367 --> 00:33:49.367
Are you going to get rich in the
petroleum industry, making 

00:33:49.367 --> 00:33:51.733
MTBE that way? 

00:33:51.733 --> 00:33:52.967
Are there any problems? 

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:08.867
What have we just been talking
about? 

00:34:08.867 --> 00:34:14.067
The competition between
substitution and elimination. 

00:34:14.067 --> 00:34:19.167
And what are the factors that
favor E2 over SN2? 

00:34:19.167 --> 00:34:19.600
Amy? 

00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:20.433
STUDENT: Steric hindrance. 

00:34:20.433 --> 00:34:22.367
PROFESSOR: Steric hindrance. 

00:34:22.367 --> 00:34:22.800
Right? 

00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:23.867
Crowded here. 

00:34:23.867 --> 00:34:26.567
It's hard for this oxygen to get
at the carbon. 

00:34:26.567 --> 00:34:29.300
And what else? 

00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:33.467
If you have an anion, a
nucleophile, that's even 

00:34:33.467 --> 00:34:36.367
better as a base, taking
hydrogen. 

00:34:36.367 --> 00:34:38.633
Here we have the worst of all
possible worlds. 

00:34:38.633 --> 00:34:41.467
We have something that wants to
take hydrogen, and something 

00:34:41.467 --> 00:34:45.233
that doesn't want to be attacked
at the carbon. 

00:34:45.233 --> 00:34:46.500
So you get elimination. 

00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:50.933
It's too hindered for SN2, and
the strong base favors E2. 

00:34:50.933 --> 00:34:55.867
All you get is the double bond
compound. 

00:34:55.867 --> 00:34:58.833
You don't get methyl t-butyl
ether. 

00:34:58.833 --> 00:35:02.567
Does the Williamson synthesis
then not work? 

00:35:02.567 --> 00:35:04.133
Do you just throw up your hands,
if 

00:35:04.133 --> 00:35:05.367
you're a synthetic chemist? 

00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:10.667
We said we wanted to make MTBE.

00:35:10.667 --> 00:35:14.300
We wanted to make that
oxygen-carbon bond. 

00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:15.533
Can you see any alternative? 

00:35:18.867 --> 00:35:20.133
To make this ether? 

00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:28.900
You can make that oxygen-carbon
bond. 

00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:33.633
There's more than one way to
skin this kind of cat. 

00:35:33.633 --> 00:35:35.933
That one won't work. 

00:35:35.933 --> 00:35:40.467
But if we do it the other way
around and make this anion, 

00:35:40.467 --> 00:35:43.733
which again would prefer to
eliminate rather than 

00:35:43.733 --> 00:35:46.200
substitute. 

00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:49.933
But you attack methyl bromide
which can't eliminate because 

00:35:49.933 --> 00:35:52.533
it doesn't have a hydrogen on
the other carbon because it 

00:35:52.533 --> 00:35:55.667
doesn't have another carbon. 

00:35:55.667 --> 00:35:59.467
Now you've got the MTBE in high
yield although nobody 

00:35:59.467 --> 00:36:00.733
makes it that way. 

00:36:00.733 --> 00:36:03.800
The stuff that's made for
petroleum is made a different 

00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:06.833
way, and we'll talk about that a
little later on. 

00:36:06.833 --> 00:36:10.367
Anyhow, this illustrates that
often there are different ways 

00:36:10.367 --> 00:36:13.167
of choosing putting the reagents
together. 

00:36:13.167 --> 00:36:16.033
One will work and one won't work
for reasons that you can 

00:36:16.033 --> 00:36:18.867
understand mechanistically. 

00:36:18.867 --> 00:36:22.767
Here's another interesting
synthetic intermediate which 

00:36:22.767 --> 00:36:26.367
is, if you start with a compound
that has OH and 

00:36:26.367 --> 00:36:31.333
chlorine on adjacent atoms and
notice it has one in the front 

00:36:31.333 --> 00:36:34.400
and one in the back. 

00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:37.100
You treat this with base. 

00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:40.467
It gives this funny ether, an
ether that's a 

00:36:40.467 --> 00:36:42.967
three-membered ring. 

00:36:42.967 --> 00:36:45.633
It does so in pretty good yield.

00:36:45.633 --> 00:36:47.033
How does it do it? 

00:36:47.033 --> 00:36:52.133
Well, hydroxide takes off this
proton and can you see what 

00:36:52.133 --> 00:36:53.400
happens next? 

00:37:01.433 --> 00:37:03.433
It's a reaction that's familiar
to you. 

00:37:07.033 --> 00:37:10.000
We want to make this bond. 

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:14.567
How do we make that second bond,
the new bond, in the 

00:37:14.567 --> 00:37:15.833
three-membered ring? 

00:37:18.033 --> 00:37:21.500
It's an SN2 reaction. 

00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:28.233
This HOMO attacks sigma-star
backside, so it's an 

00:37:28.233 --> 00:37:32.267
intramolecular SN2 reaction. 

00:37:32.267 --> 00:37:35.300
And chloride leaves to generate
this 

00:37:35.300 --> 00:37:36.500
three-membered ring. 

00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:40.800
The three-membered ether is
called sometimes epoxide, 

00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:43.067
sometimes oxirane. 

00:37:43.067 --> 00:37:47.100
Some people call it one, some
call it the other. 

00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:53.500
In fact, epoxides are very
useful synthetic intermediates,

00:37:53.500 --> 00:38:02.933
because, although R-O minus is a
crummy leaving group, in 

00:38:02.933 --> 00:38:06.033
this case it's helped by losing
the ring strain. 

00:38:06.033 --> 00:38:10.900
So it's spring-loaded to open
up. 

00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:15.200
You can attack here with some
nucleophile, break the bond, 

00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:19.867
the O minus comes away, and this
gives a way of adding 

00:38:19.867 --> 00:38:22.800
C-C-O to a nucleophile. 

00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:26.800
You bring some nucleophile in,
and it adds to the nucleophile 

00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:29.467
two carbons and then an oxygen.

00:38:29.467 --> 00:38:33.500
Synthetic chemists often think,
what is it? 

00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:39.400
If I want to get this product,
that's something plus C-C-O. 

00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:41.400
How could I do that? 

00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:43.133
Ethylene oxide. 

00:38:43.133 --> 00:38:46.000
That epoxide can do it. 

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.900
In fact we're going to talk more
about that as a synthetic 

00:38:48.900 --> 00:38:50.467
intermediate later. 

00:38:50.467 --> 00:38:54.033
For example, that's the stuff
from which you make crown 

00:38:54.033 --> 00:38:58.800
ethers because it has, remember,
C-C-O, C-C-O, C-C-O, 

00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:03.367
but we'll talk about that in a
few lectures further on. 

00:39:03.367 --> 00:39:06.733
For synthetic purposes a
particularly useful set of 

00:39:06.733 --> 00:39:11.533
nucleophiles is cyanide,
acetylide, the thing you get 

00:39:11.533 --> 00:39:15.700
by losing a proton from
acetylene, and this other type 

00:39:15.700 --> 00:39:20.200
of anion, which has an
alpha-anion. 

00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:23.000
It's lost a proton adjacent to
carbonyls. 

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:25.200
We talked about that one before.

00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:28.133
The reason these are interesting
is because they 

00:39:28.133 --> 00:39:32.000
are nucleophiles that form
carbon-carbon bonds. 

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:37.100
Most of the things we've talked
about replace one 

00:39:37.100 --> 00:39:38.533
functional group by another. 

00:39:38.533 --> 00:39:40.100
A leaving group goes away. 

00:39:40.100 --> 00:39:41.500
The new one comes in. 

00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:43.933
The new one is typically
something 

00:39:43.933 --> 00:39:46.533
like oxygen or nitrogen. 

00:39:46.533 --> 00:39:51.367
But these anions have carbon
coming in and that means you 

00:39:51.367 --> 00:39:53.400
make a new carbon skeleton. 

00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:56.900
That's something that's very
important in putting together 

00:39:56.900 --> 00:39:58.900
organic molecules. 

00:39:58.900 --> 00:40:03.833
Notice that these two both have
a pKa of 9. 

00:40:03.833 --> 00:40:05.700
You put the starting material--

00:40:05.700 --> 00:40:08.900
that is, the protonated forms
have a pKa of 9-- 

00:40:08.900 --> 00:40:10.967
put them in with base and you
get the anion 

00:40:10.967 --> 00:40:13.633
and it does its trick. 

00:40:13.633 --> 00:40:14.433
Acetylide 

00:40:14.433 --> 00:40:17.033
is pKa of 25. 

00:40:17.033 --> 00:40:18.767
You can't use that in water. 

00:40:18.767 --> 00:40:21.933
It would immediately take the
proton away from water. 

00:40:21.933 --> 00:40:26.067
So it's a base, and it actually
tends to do elimination 

00:40:26.067 --> 00:40:29.533
sometimes rather than
substitution. 

00:40:29.533 --> 00:40:32.533
So you need a stronger base if
you want to pull off a proton 

00:40:32.533 --> 00:40:34.000
and do that. 

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:38.433
You can do it with sodium amide
notice that this is the 

00:40:38.433 --> 00:40:41.867
anion coming from NH3 as the
acid. 

00:40:41.867 --> 00:40:44.133
And NH3 then is the product
after it's 

00:40:44.133 --> 00:40:45.567
pulled off this proton. 

00:40:45.567 --> 00:40:49.667
And it is a much, much stronger
base, a much weaker 

00:40:49.667 --> 00:40:53.500
acid by nine powers of 10 than
the acetylide is. 

00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:55.133
You could make it that way. 

00:40:55.133 --> 00:40:57.033
These could be important in
synthesis. 

00:40:57.033 --> 00:41:00.367
We'll see later on in the course
how very important 

00:41:00.367 --> 00:41:02.467
nucleophiles that are carbon are
in 

00:41:02.467 --> 00:41:05.900
putting molecules together. 

00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:09.000
Now if we look at the rate of
the reaction of sodium 

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:11.767
hydroxide with an alkyl bromide,

00:41:11.767 --> 00:41:13.000
for different R groups. 

00:41:16.367 --> 00:41:19.300
We're going to look at a log
scale so we can cover five 

00:41:19.300 --> 00:41:21.267
powers of 10 in the rate. 

00:41:21.267 --> 00:41:28.733
And it's how much of R-Br gets
converted to HO-R per minute. 

00:41:28.733 --> 00:41:29.733
We're going to do it in 

00:41:29.733 --> 00:41:34.433
ethanol/water, 4:1 at 55
degrees. 

00:41:34.433 --> 00:41:44.933
We see 1% about 10^-2, of methyl
bromide is converted to 

00:41:44.933 --> 00:41:46.167
this ether-- 

00:41:46.167 --> 00:41:50.933
or pardon me, to the alcohol--
per minute, 1% per minute. 

00:41:50.933 --> 00:41:57.533
If we make it ethyl bromide,
it's only a tenth of a percent 

00:41:57.533 --> 00:41:59.933
per minute. 

00:41:59.933 --> 00:42:01.267
What would you expect for
isopropyl? 

00:42:03.733 --> 00:42:05.033
Looks good. 

00:42:05.033 --> 00:42:06.300
What do you expect for t-butyl?

00:42:11.867 --> 00:42:12.933
So there's something funny. 

00:42:12.933 --> 00:42:15.700
Something has changed when we
went from methyl, ethyl, 

00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:16.967
isopropyl, and t-butyl. 

00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:25.633
This was done with 0.01 molar
sodium hydroxide 

00:42:25.633 --> 00:42:27.267
getting these rates. 

00:42:27.267 --> 00:42:30.400
It turns out that the rate of
these depends on how much 

00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:31.667
hydroxide there is. 

00:42:31.667 --> 00:42:34.067
That doesn't surprise you, it's
SN2. 

00:42:34.067 --> 00:42:38.500
Depends on how much of the
nucleophile there is. 

00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:42.733
In fact, if you looked at the
second-order rate constant, 

00:42:42.733 --> 00:42:46.900
which takes into account the
concentration of base, then 

00:42:46.900 --> 00:42:50.867
you see these fall on a nice
curve and it's slowed down by 

00:42:50.867 --> 00:42:54.233
crowding, the steric hindrance
that we talked about before. 

00:42:54.233 --> 00:42:57.533
But you'd expect t-butyl to be
down here someplace. 

00:42:57.533 --> 00:43:00.767
In fact, it's up there. 

00:43:00.767 --> 00:43:05.900
That's because that one is not
dependent on hydroxide. 

00:43:05.900 --> 00:43:07.967
It's not SN2. 

00:43:07.967 --> 00:43:10.100
The rate doesn't depend both on
the 

00:43:10.100 --> 00:43:12.533
halide and the hydroxide. 

00:43:12.533 --> 00:43:16.300
It depends only on the halide. 

00:43:16.300 --> 00:43:18.933
At the rate-determining step,
the base hasn't gotten 

00:43:18.933 --> 00:43:20.167
involved yet. 

00:43:23.033 --> 00:43:25.700
Notice that it's accelerated by
crowding. 

00:43:25.700 --> 00:43:28.200
When you get to the most crowded
one, that mechanism 

00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:37.167
goes really fast. It can happen
because the cation is 

00:43:37.167 --> 00:43:40.300
more stable when it's more
substituted. 

00:43:40.300 --> 00:43:43.467
It's also accelerated by a polar
solvent. 

00:43:43.467 --> 00:43:46.333
If you try a solvent that's not
polar, it's harder to make 

00:43:46.333 --> 00:43:48.600
ions in it. 

00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:54.333
But the ethanol and water is a
reasonably polar solvent. 

00:43:54.333 --> 00:43:59.333
"This is the SN1 reaction, as
opposed to SN2. 

00:43:59.333 --> 00:44:05.433
This categorization was
formulated, SN1, SN2, in 

00:44:05.433 --> 00:44:11.667
England, in London, in the 1930s
by Hughes and Ingold. 

00:44:11.667 --> 00:44:15.000
That rate actually wasn't
measured at that temperature. 

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:17.167
They measured at a lower
temperature and figured out 

00:44:17.167 --> 00:44:20.400
what it would be at this
temperature. 

00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:24.233
This is how much is converted to
HO-R but some of the 

00:44:24.233 --> 00:44:27.900
starting material is not
converted to HO-R. Some of it 

00:44:27.900 --> 00:44:30.333
undergoes elimination. 

00:44:30.333 --> 00:44:36.267
At this stage 19%, about
one-fifth of the product, is 

00:44:36.267 --> 00:44:40.000
in fact the elimination product,
E2. 

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:43.300
The base attacks the adjacent
hydrogen rather than waiting 

00:44:43.300 --> 00:44:45.100
for it to ionize. 

00:44:45.100 --> 00:44:49.400
And we know it's E2 because the
amount you get depends on 

00:44:49.400 --> 00:44:52.233
how much hydroxide you put in
there. 

00:44:52.233 --> 00:44:55.600
The rate of forming the alcohol,
the rate of the 

00:44:55.600 --> 00:44:59.633
substitution, doesn't depend on
the hydroxide. 

00:44:59.633 --> 00:45:01.767
But the rate of forming the
alkene does 

00:45:01.767 --> 00:45:03.633
depend on the hydroxide. 

00:45:03.633 --> 00:45:06.733
You change the ratio of the
products by changing the 

00:45:06.733 --> 00:45:09.533
hydroxide concentration. 

00:45:09.533 --> 00:45:14.700
Now you can have SN1 and E1 as
well. 

00:45:14.700 --> 00:45:18.200
In that case we just talked
about, if you put more 

00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:21.433
hydroxide in, the starting
material goes away more 

00:45:21.433 --> 00:45:25.533
rapidly because the elimination
is 

00:45:25.533 --> 00:45:27.233
dependent on hydroxide. 

00:45:27.233 --> 00:45:30.867
But in the case here where it's
cyanide, that's the high 

00:45:30.867 --> 00:45:33.833
HOMO, that's doing the
attacking, you find that you 

00:45:33.833 --> 00:45:37.633
get not only the cyanide
substitution but you also get 

00:45:37.633 --> 00:45:38.900
substitution by water. 

00:45:43.267 --> 00:45:47.267
The product ratio depends on how
much cyanide you put in. 

00:45:47.267 --> 00:45:48.267
That doesn't surprise you. 

00:45:48.267 --> 00:45:50.700
You put in more cyanide, the
formation of 

00:45:50.700 --> 00:45:53.267
this product is faster. 

00:45:53.267 --> 00:45:54.933
But the rate doesn't change. 

00:45:58.267 --> 00:46:01.133
The rate of destroying the
starting material doesn't 

00:46:01.133 --> 00:46:03.700
change when you do this. 

00:46:03.700 --> 00:46:06.100
Can anybody see how that could
be? 

00:46:06.100 --> 00:46:09.133
How could you change the
products but 

00:46:09.133 --> 00:46:10.400
not change the rate? 

00:46:15.667 --> 00:46:16.100
Matt? 

00:46:16.100 --> 00:46:17.333
STUDENT: Because even though you
have a different ratio, it 

00:46:17.333 --> 00:46:18.600
could be doing a different
mechanism, possibly. 

00:46:25.367 --> 00:46:27.033
PROFESSOR: Let's try it here. 

00:46:27.033 --> 00:46:30.000
We have this starting material
and these two products. 

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:32.933
We're going to draw a reaction
coordinate diagram to get from 

00:46:32.933 --> 00:46:35.333
the starting material to the
products. 

00:46:35.333 --> 00:46:40.800
Here we formed, as in SN1, an
intermediate cation. 

00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:43.867
And then it goes on, if there's
cyanide around, to 

00:46:43.867 --> 00:46:48.267
give that product or with water
to give that product. 

00:46:48.267 --> 00:46:50.967
What determines the rate of the
process? 

00:46:50.967 --> 00:46:53.933
What's the rate-determining
step? 

00:46:53.933 --> 00:46:56.333
The red one, right? 

00:46:56.333 --> 00:47:00.133
That happens before you decide
which product you get. 

00:47:00.133 --> 00:47:02.933
If you have more cyanide in
there, more of it 

00:47:02.933 --> 00:47:05.500
will go this way. 

00:47:05.500 --> 00:47:10.600
You can change the products
without changing the rate, if 

00:47:10.600 --> 00:47:12.700
you have this cation
intermediate. 

00:47:12.700 --> 00:47:15.600
So if the product is determined
after the rate, by 

00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:20.100
competition for the short lived
cation, that's evidence 

00:47:20.100 --> 00:47:22.533
that you have a cation
intermediate in this 

00:47:22.533 --> 00:47:25.200
substitution. 

00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:29.233
Here's silver nitrate helping to
pull off the 

00:47:29.233 --> 00:47:31.567
leaving group, iodide. 

00:47:31.567 --> 00:47:34.533
Notice what's funny in this
case. 

00:47:34.533 --> 00:47:37.767
Whoops, what's funny is I've
talked my head off here. 

00:47:40.533 --> 00:47:42.633
There are a few more slides that
I think it would be 

00:47:42.633 --> 00:47:49.233
helpful to have to make the exam
coherent. 

00:47:49.233 --> 00:47:51.367
Since the exam's going to be on
Friday, why don't we put a 

00:47:51.367 --> 00:47:55.333
few more of them onto the next
and I apologize. 

00:47:55.333 --> 00:47:56.433
I'll let you go now. 

00:47:56.433 --> 00:48:00.800
We'll do a few more slides next
time for the exam. 

00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:03.067
And there will be a review
session on Wednesday.

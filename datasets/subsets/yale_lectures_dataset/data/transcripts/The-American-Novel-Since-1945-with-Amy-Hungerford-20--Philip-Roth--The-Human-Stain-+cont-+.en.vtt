00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:04.331
Professor Amy
Hungerford: Today I'm going

00:00:04.331 --> 00:00:07.410
to talk about censorship in the
United States since 1945,

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.751
in the period that we're
studying, and I'm going to

00:00:10.751 --> 00:00:14.894
connect that with The Human
Stain and some of my general

00:00:14.894 --> 00:00:18.770
thoughts about Roth's work at
the very end of lecture.

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:23.420
So, I'll give you a little bit
of history and then a little bit

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.127
of meditation on Roth.
I asked you,

00:00:26.127 --> 00:00:30.813
for today, to go around to the
various bookstores in New Haven,

00:00:30.813 --> 00:00:34.820
choose one and go,
and observe what you saw there.

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.372
And in particular I asked you
to think about what you are not

00:00:39.372 --> 00:00:42.884
seeing there.
So, does anyone want to tell me

00:00:42.884 --> 00:00:46.560
what they saw on their little
observation trip?

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:47.240
What did you observe?

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:54.870
Yes.Student:
I went to Labyrinth,

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.760
and they had a ton of history,
historiography,

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.990
cultural studies,
all in the front,

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:05.729
that seemed very deliberately
diverse.Professor Amy

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.009
Hungerford: Diverse in what
way?Student:

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:13.102
Diverse,
culturally, as far as the

00:01:13.102 --> 00:01:18.432
history books that I looked at.
They ranged anything from

00:01:18.432 --> 00:01:21.765
Germany during the Weimar
Republic, to the history of

00:01:21.765 --> 00:01:25.799
tragedy,
to death in the Atlantic slave

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:32.569
trade, to all sorts of other
things, though mainly European.

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:36.186
What was not there,
which I found interesting,

00:01:36.186 --> 00:01:38.677
which I looked for
specifically,

00:01:38.677 --> 00:01:43.739
because I thought it might not
be there, was Mein Kampf.

00:01:43.739 --> 00:01:44.969
Professor Amy
Hungerford: Did you look

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:46.385
back in the stacks too?
Uh huh.Student:

00:01:46.385 --> 00:01:47.660
Yeah, I looked in the
stacks.

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:49.179
I didn't see it there,
or in the library at all,

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:50.440
so I guess they don't support
Hitler,

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.171
which I approve
of.Professor Amy

00:01:52.171 --> 00:01:54.906
Hungerford: You approve of
Mein Kampf not being in

00:01:54.906 --> 00:01:56.338
Labyrinth bookstore.
Student:

00:01:56.338 --> 00:01:57.397
I approve of not supporting
Hitler, I guess,

00:01:57.397 --> 00:01:58.411
Mein Kampf…
Professor Amy

00:01:58.411 --> 00:01:59.753
Hungerford: Very good.
Okay.

00:01:59.753 --> 00:02:04.900
What else?
What else did people notice?

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:10.000
What did you notice about the
bookstore?

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.688
Yes.Student:
There is a table that has

00:02:12.688 --> 00:02:15.097
works by Yale
graduates.Professor Amy

00:02:15.097 --> 00:02:18.457
Hungerford: Which bookstore
did you go to?Student:

00:02:18.457 --> 00:02:22.313
Barnes and Noble.
Yeah, so just clearly trying to

00:02:22.313 --> 00:02:25.942
sell to the market they
know.Professor Amy

00:02:25.942 --> 00:02:28.740
Hungerford: By Yale
graduates.

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.778
But here's a question:
not by Yale

00:02:30.778 --> 00:02:33.064
professors?Student:
I'm not

00:02:33.064 --> 00:02:35.968
sure.Professor Amy
Hungerford: It's a

00:02:35.968 --> 00:02:40.290
significant difference.
What else did you notice?

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:47.710
Yes. Local market.
What else did you notice?

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:49.498
Someone--Yes,
Eli.Student:

00:02:49.498 --> 00:02:52.627
I guess that I really
haven't thought about this this

00:02:52.627 --> 00:02:55.475
much,
but how much of a decision it

00:02:55.475 --> 00:02:59.520
is to decide what kind of shelf
the book goes in,

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.724
like history versus philosophy,
and I guess it's probably the

00:03:02.724 --> 00:03:04.782
publishers who do that,
or, I don't know,

00:03:04.782 --> 00:03:06.737
but--Professor Amy
Hungerford: Well,

00:03:06.737 --> 00:03:09.074
this is a really important
question: where to shelve the

00:03:09.074 --> 00:03:10.746
book.
Now, it's not just about

00:03:10.746 --> 00:03:13.343
categories, although it is
partly about categories,

00:03:13.343 --> 00:03:15.680
what subject matter does a book
belong to;

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.629
it's also about what kind of
shelf, physically.

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:23.548
So those tables that we're
thinking about in Labyrinth,

00:03:23.548 --> 00:03:27.919
with that array of literature,
who chose that?

00:03:27.919 --> 00:03:33.640
Does anyone know who chose that
literature to put on that table?

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.360
I can tell you in a minute.
One question is: who chose that?

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.599
Now, those tables are in Barnes
and Noble, too.

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:42.344
So, you walk into the bookstore
on the ground level,

00:03:42.344 --> 00:03:45.465
and there are all those tables,
and the stacks go up really

00:03:45.465 --> 00:03:47.907
high.
There are all these elaborate

00:03:47.907 --> 00:03:50.810
ways of getting books' covers to
face you.

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.643
Okay.
Then there are all the stacks

00:03:53.643 --> 00:03:58.060
and shelves up on the upper
level, and those books are

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.310
interspersed with smaller
displays.

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:03.928
So, if you go up there,
you'll begin to see some very

00:04:03.928 --> 00:04:06.103
interesting things.
There's a little table,

00:04:06.103 --> 00:04:07.659
for example,
up on the right.

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:12.801
Maybe you noticed this,
right as you come up the stairs

00:04:12.801 --> 00:04:17.276
in Barnes and Noble,
and it's promoted as "urban

00:04:17.276 --> 00:04:20.746
literature."
Well, in my experience,

00:04:20.746 --> 00:04:25.909
having seen it over the years,
it's really just code for black

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:29.180
writers,
somehow, so it's all these

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:34.310
books about the black history of
New Haven, or whatever.

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:37.129
So, you have these little
tables around.

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:40.256
Now, the big tables in
front of Barnes and Noble,

00:04:40.256 --> 00:04:45.362
who chooses what goes on there?
That space is bought and paid

00:04:45.362 --> 00:04:49.670
for by publishers,
bought and paid for.

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:53.310
It's part of the contract with
the publisher to stock that book

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:55.600
that it be displayed in certain
ways.

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.725
You know those nice discounts
that you get,

00:04:58.725 --> 00:05:02.744
20% off the New York Times
bestseller books when

00:05:02.744 --> 00:05:06.483
they're in hardback?
Those are possible at Barnes

00:05:06.483 --> 00:05:10.810
and Noble because of the huge
buying power of that bookstore.

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:15.804
So, they buy in huge volume.
Now, a store like Labyrinth or

00:05:15.804 --> 00:05:20.246
its predecessor,
Book Haven, wasn't able to have

00:05:20.246 --> 00:05:25.541
that kind of volume in sales,
and so they couldn't negotiate

00:05:25.541 --> 00:05:28.569
with a publisher that sort of
discount.

00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:31.157
So, that means that a smaller
bookstore, because of its

00:05:31.157 --> 00:05:34.361
smaller buying power,
can't provide a competitive

00:05:34.361 --> 00:05:39.110
price in a market where Barnes
and Noble is right next door.

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:42.677
Now, there were ways that
independent bookstores try to

00:05:42.677 --> 00:05:45.665
compensate for that,
especially in this market,

00:05:45.665 --> 00:05:49.500
by giving discounts to faculty
members stocking their books at

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.301
the bookstore.
This is somewhat controversial,

00:05:52.301 --> 00:05:55.373
although it's Barnes and Noble
that has tried to make it

00:05:55.373 --> 00:05:59.060
controversial by bringing it up
with the university and saying,

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:01.759
"Now, isn't this a kind of
bribery?"

00:06:01.759 --> 00:06:05.117
But that's the way that a store
like Labyrinth,

00:06:05.117 --> 00:06:09.536
or like Book Haven before it,
was able to try to be price

00:06:09.536 --> 00:06:14.170
competitive among people it knew
wanted to buy from them,

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:17.311
those professors who stock
their book at an independent

00:06:17.311 --> 00:06:19.407
bookstore.
So, back to this question

00:06:19.407 --> 00:06:22.201
of who decides what's on the
table: at Labyrinth I went in,

00:06:22.201 --> 00:06:24.610
and I said, "Who decides what's
on this table?"

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:27.017
And they said,
"Oh, she's over there," and I

00:06:27.017 --> 00:06:30.322
went and talked to her and I
said, "How do you decide what's

00:06:30.322 --> 00:06:32.536
on the table?"
She said, "Well,

00:06:32.536 --> 00:06:37.060
you know, I had a good general
education as a young person,

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:40.678
and I kind of know who's who in
the intellectual circles in

00:06:40.678 --> 00:06:44.176
Europe and in the United States.
And so I browse the lists,

00:06:44.176 --> 00:06:46.399
and I talk to sales reps when
they come in,

00:06:46.399 --> 00:06:48.730
and I read,
and I look at what certain

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:51.545
courses are stocking,
and I see what people are

00:06:51.545 --> 00:06:54.319
reading on campus,
and then I decide."

00:06:54.319 --> 00:06:58.898
That's really different from
that space being bought and paid

00:06:58.898 --> 00:07:03.019
for by a publisher as part of a
marketing agreement.

00:07:03.019 --> 00:07:06.552
Those tables are very powerful,
for browsers,

00:07:06.552 --> 00:07:10.004
in shaping what browsers might
possibly buy,

00:07:10.004 --> 00:07:12.975
or think about,
when they come in to a

00:07:12.975 --> 00:07:15.909
bookstore.
So, that space is

00:07:15.909 --> 00:07:19.207
particularly key to a
bookstore's presence,

00:07:19.207 --> 00:07:23.263
culturally, in the community.
And Sarah's point,

00:07:23.263 --> 00:07:28.238
about the Yale graduates on the
bookshelf: that is a nod to

00:07:28.238 --> 00:07:31.670
Barnes and Noble's immediate
context.

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:34.220
So, there is that local
marketing piece.

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:41.435
But, think about this.
There are just a few fiction

00:07:41.435 --> 00:07:46.718
buyers who work with publishers
to decide what novels will end

00:07:46.718 --> 00:07:49.853
up in Barnes and Noble.
So, writers,

00:07:49.853 --> 00:07:53.610
when they're thinking about,
"can I sell my book?"

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:58.671
instead of thinking,
"I wonder if I can impress the

00:07:58.671 --> 00:08:04.240
owner of the Seminary Co-op in
Hyde Park in Chicago,"

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:07.312
--a very famous,
huge, wonderful bookstore,

00:08:07.312 --> 00:08:11.482
not a chain--instead of saying,
"I want to sell my book in

00:08:11.482 --> 00:08:13.436
Chicago.
It's set there,

00:08:13.436 --> 00:08:17.510
and maybe it'll be appealing.
I wonder if I can impress the

00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:21.550
owner of that bookstore," and
having a strategy that addresses

00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:24.928
those kinds of individual
circumstances in different

00:08:24.928 --> 00:08:29.743
spaces-- Powell's in Seattle,
Labyrinth in New York--they

00:08:29.743 --> 00:08:35.630
have to say, "I wonder if I can
impress the buy from Barnes and

00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:38.506
Noble."
So, instead of many people

00:08:38.506 --> 00:08:42.506
making that decision about
whether a novel is worthy of

00:08:42.506 --> 00:08:45.100
being promoted,
it's one person.

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:50.685
That person becomes extremely
powerful in shaping what

00:08:50.685 --> 00:08:56.059
literary texts reach us,
what comes to our attention

00:08:56.059 --> 00:09:00.425
through the bookstore.
Now, have you ever

00:09:00.425 --> 00:09:05.153
wondered, as you're driving down
the street, why there might be a

00:09:05.153 --> 00:09:08.774
Dunkin' Donuts here,
and a Dunkin' Donuts just two

00:09:08.774 --> 00:09:11.980
blocks away?
Have you ever noticed that?

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:14.699
There are various stores that
you'll see this:

00:09:14.699 --> 00:09:17.419
gas stations sometimes,
fast food restaurants,

00:09:17.419 --> 00:09:20.775
sometimes Wal-Mart.
Bookstores are another that you

00:09:20.775 --> 00:09:23.980
will sometimes see this.
Why is that?

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:28.675
Well, what they're doing is
competing in an overwhelming way

00:09:28.675 --> 00:09:31.539
with another store in that
market.

00:09:31.539 --> 00:09:34.668
Usually this happens when
they're trying to drive another

00:09:34.668 --> 00:09:38.115
store out of business.
So, they're a big enough chain,

00:09:38.115 --> 00:09:42.053
they can absorb losses from an
unproductive second store to

00:09:42.053 --> 00:09:45.424
saturate a market,
and then they can absorb the

00:09:45.424 --> 00:09:49.314
closing of that second store
once the competitor has been

00:09:49.314 --> 00:09:52.964
driven out of business.
So that's why that market

00:09:52.964 --> 00:09:56.220
saturation happens.
It's not because they think

00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:59.384
it's going to be profitable,
that there's another

00:09:59.384 --> 00:10:03.275
hundred-percent increase when
they add that second store one

00:10:03.275 --> 00:10:06.570
block over.
It's all about market

00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:10.169
saturation.
It's getting it as close to a

00:10:10.169 --> 00:10:14.679
hundred percent as possible.
So, those kinds of tactics are

00:10:14.679 --> 00:10:18.692
possible for chain stores,
and they are not possible for

00:10:18.692 --> 00:10:22.410
independent bookstores.
And this is how many

00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:28.146
independent bookstores have been
taken off the map in our cities

00:10:28.146 --> 00:10:33.274
and in the suburbs.
So, this is one way that

00:10:33.274 --> 00:10:39.076
censorship comes to us:
not in that old-fashioned way

00:10:39.076 --> 00:10:43.093
of censorship laws,
but in a new way,

00:10:43.093 --> 00:10:48.374
market censorship.
This has always been part of

00:10:48.374 --> 00:10:52.350
how things work in a capitalist
economy.

00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:56.128
It's true that in the past
literary enterprises--be they

00:10:56.128 --> 00:11:00.388
selling books or writing books
or publishing books--had to make

00:11:00.388 --> 00:11:02.929
a profit in order to stay
afloat.

00:11:02.929 --> 00:11:07.822
But the way that profit was
made has changed from the early

00:11:07.822 --> 00:11:12.884
twentieth century until this
point, and I'm going to say more

00:11:12.884 --> 00:11:15.927
about that.
So, just by going in to the

00:11:15.927 --> 00:11:19.941
bookstore, I want you to think
about--the next time you go in,

00:11:19.941 --> 00:11:23.429
think about how things are
being presented to you.

00:11:23.429 --> 00:11:27.475
Now, how many of you get most
of the books you buy--not for

00:11:27.475 --> 00:11:30.614
classes…well,
let's just ask this,

00:11:30.614 --> 00:11:35.509
blanket, and then I'll break it
down--how many of you get most

00:11:35.509 --> 00:11:38.800
of the books you buy from a
bookstore?

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:42.526
Still quite a few of you.
How many of you get them mostly

00:11:42.526 --> 00:11:47.299
over the internet?
Okay, not a majority.

00:11:47.299 --> 00:11:50.945
Taking out classes,
books you buy for pleasure,

00:11:50.945 --> 00:11:55.303
your own decision to buy them,
how many of you are still

00:11:55.303 --> 00:11:59.259
buying those in bookstores?
Okay, actually a lot of you.

00:11:59.259 --> 00:12:02.495
So, that really,
even, tips the scale in favor

00:12:02.495 --> 00:12:05.730
of bookstores,
so that's interesting to me.

00:12:05.730 --> 00:12:08.149
I wasn't sure what you would
say.

00:12:08.149 --> 00:12:13.472
That suggests that bookstores
are still powerful purveyors of

00:12:13.472 --> 00:12:16.585
culture;
they still shape what you think

00:12:16.585 --> 00:12:19.388
about and what you read.
It's browsing,

00:12:19.388 --> 00:12:23.712
or maybe that you've read about
something, and you go looking

00:12:23.712 --> 00:12:27.100
for it, that brings you in to
the bookstore.

00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:34.433
Censorship does have a
legal history in this part of

00:12:34.433 --> 00:12:39.620
the century.
And so now I want to just give

00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:42.940
you a little rundown of that.

00:12:47.009 --> 00:12:49.896
So, this is actually a title of
a chapter of a book that I will

00:12:49.896 --> 00:12:53.099
be writing on the post-45 novel,
and I'm going to have this as

00:12:53.099 --> 00:12:56.660
the last chapter of that book.
The reason for that is that

00:12:56.660 --> 00:13:00.524
censorship and what I'm calling
censure--that's the public

00:13:00.524 --> 00:13:05.132
outcry against literature,
even not on legal grounds--is a

00:13:05.132 --> 00:13:09.480
way for the culture to speak
back to the literary.

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:12.623
So, I spend a lot of time in
this class, and in my teaching

00:13:12.623 --> 00:13:15.930
in general, and in my writing,
talking about what books say to

00:13:15.930 --> 00:13:18.524
us.
But what do we say back to

00:13:18.524 --> 00:13:23.920
those books as a society?
Well, censorship and its

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:30.679
companion, censure,
do a lot of that talking back.

00:13:30.679 --> 00:13:33.470
So, there are two sides of
access to literature.

00:13:33.470 --> 00:13:37.424
I've just been talking a little
bit about market constraints on

00:13:37.424 --> 00:13:40.905
what can be published and read,
and now I'm going to talk a

00:13:40.905 --> 00:13:42.740
little bit about legal
constraints.

00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:47.503
I'm going to get back to the
market constraints in a little

00:13:47.503 --> 00:13:50.319
while.
Since the early twentieth

00:13:50.319 --> 00:13:54.490
century, a lot of the legal
constraints on publishing and

00:13:54.490 --> 00:13:57.320
distributing literature have
eased.

00:13:57.320 --> 00:14:02.248
In the 1870s,
the Comstock laws in the United

00:14:02.248 --> 00:14:08.072
States aimed to regulate the use
of the mails for the

00:14:08.072 --> 00:14:12.440
dissemination of obscene
materials.

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:18.381
These laws were used in 1914 to
indict Margaret Sanger for

00:14:18.381 --> 00:14:23.697
sending information about
contraception across state

00:14:23.697 --> 00:14:26.678
lines,
and she had to flee,

00:14:26.678 --> 00:14:31.039
and she left the country to
protect herself.

00:14:31.039 --> 00:14:35.080
So, just the description of how
contraception worked was a

00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:40.413
violation of the Comstock laws;
so of course we're happily out

00:14:40.413 --> 00:14:44.465
of that moment.
In 1933, for literature there

00:14:44.465 --> 00:14:49.293
was a major decision by Judge
Woolsey declaring that James

00:14:49.293 --> 00:14:52.850
Joyce's Ulysses was not
obscene.

00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:58.730
Often censorship in literature
would have to do with the import

00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:02.429
of literature into the United
States.

00:15:02.429 --> 00:15:05.740
So, this is sort of on the same
logic as the Comstock laws.

00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:09.563
The Comstock laws regulate the
traveling of obscene literature

00:15:09.563 --> 00:15:13.359
across state lines.
Customs regulations regulated

00:15:13.359 --> 00:15:16.950
obscenity coming in to the
United States.

00:15:16.950 --> 00:15:20.325
Why is obscenity important?
Well, obscenity is largely

00:15:20.325 --> 00:15:24.811
recognized by legal scholars as
not being protected by the

00:15:24.811 --> 00:15:30.080
Fourteenth Amendment;
it is not protected speech.

00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:34.201
So, that's why it was important
for someone who wanted to keep

00:15:34.201 --> 00:15:38.120
Ulysses out of American
hands to call it obscene.

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:42.712
Now, it's very interesting to
read what Woolsey says about

00:15:42.712 --> 00:15:43.760
Ulysses.

00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:51.188
It just shows you how the
learned reading of literature

00:15:51.188 --> 00:15:54.480
comes to have a legal impact in
the world.

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:59.613
So, this is Woolsey on Joyce: 
Joyce has attempted,

00:15:59.613 --> 00:16:02.064
it seems to me,
with astonishing success,

00:16:02.064 --> 00:16:04.700
to show how the screen of
consciousness,

00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:08.120
with its ever-shifting
kaleidoscopic impressions,

00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:11.470
carries, as it were,
on a plastic palimpsest,

00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:15.003
not only what is in the focus
of each man's observation of the

00:16:15.003 --> 00:16:18.855
actual things about him,
but also on a penumbral zone

00:16:18.855 --> 00:16:23.712
residual of past impressions,
some recent and some drawn up

00:16:23.712 --> 00:16:26.272
by association,
from the domain of the

00:16:26.272 --> 00:16:28.696
subconscious.
He's talking about the

00:16:28.696 --> 00:16:32.629
stream-of-consciousness method
of narration in Ulysses.

00:16:32.629 --> 00:16:35.888
He shows how each of these
impressions affects the life and

00:16:35.888 --> 00:16:38.620
the behavior of the character
which he is describing,

00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:42.794
and I'm going to skip down.
He goes on to detail more about

00:16:42.794 --> 00:16:46.651
Joyce's technique:
"It is because Joyce has been

00:16:46.651 --> 00:16:51.082
loyal to his technique and has
not funked its necessary

00:16:51.082 --> 00:16:54.242
implications,
but has honestly attempted to

00:16:54.242 --> 00:16:57.666
tell fully what his characters
think about, that he has been

00:16:57.666 --> 00:17:01.638
the subject of so many attacks,
and that his purpose has been

00:17:01.638 --> 00:17:04.670
so often misunderstood and
misrepresented."

00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:10.473
So, here, Woolsey takes a very
serious view of Joyce's artistic

00:17:10.473 --> 00:17:15.620
project, and he takes as the
mark of its success what he

00:17:15.620 --> 00:17:20.019
calls the loyalty of Joyce to
that project,

00:17:20.019 --> 00:17:23.986
of showing exactly what
characters think in their

00:17:23.986 --> 00:17:27.754
subconscious associations,
as those rise into

00:17:27.754 --> 00:17:35.042
consciousness and into language.
That principle is furthered in

00:17:35.042 --> 00:17:42.900
the United States in 1957 with a
case called Roth.

00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:47.543
It's Roth v.
United States,

00:17:47.543 --> 00:17:55.746
and in this case Woolsey's
approach to the literary is

00:17:55.746 --> 00:18:04.259
enshrined in American law,
affirmed as a precedent.

00:18:04.259 --> 00:18:10.371
So, according to the Roth case,
something can be judged obscene

00:18:10.371 --> 00:18:13.920
only if it meets three
conditions,

00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:18.255
and those are these:
The books' descriptions of

00:18:18.255 --> 00:18:24.098
nudity or sex must go beyond the
limits of taste established by

00:18:24.098 --> 00:18:27.654
community standards.
So that phrase,

00:18:27.654 --> 00:18:32.572
"community standards," will
become very important in later

00:18:32.572 --> 00:18:36.109
law, and I'll mention how in a
minute.

00:18:36.109 --> 00:18:40.000
"It must not appeal to the
interests of the average adult."

00:18:43.009 --> 00:18:47.676
So, you have to be really
aberrant in order to meet this

00:18:47.676 --> 00:18:50.133
standard;
it can't appeal to the

00:18:50.133 --> 00:18:55.209
interests of the average adult.
That's what makes it obscene,

00:18:55.209 --> 00:19:00.140
so--I don't know--necrophilia,
maybe that counts.

00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:04.788
And lastly--this is the
kicker--it must have no

00:19:04.788 --> 00:19:09.640
redeeming social or literary
value whatsoever.

00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:14.082
That means if you can prove
just that one,

00:19:14.082 --> 00:19:17.659
you're safe.
So, no matter what it is,

00:19:17.659 --> 00:19:22.107
even if it is necrophilia,
if you can prove that it has

00:19:22.107 --> 00:19:25.320
literary value it cannot be
obscene.

00:19:29.049 --> 00:19:32.962
And so this particular
standard comes in to play when

00:19:32.962 --> 00:19:36.664
Allen Ginsberg's Howl
goes on trial in--I think

00:19:36.664 --> 00:19:41.337
it's 1959--it goes on trial.
Similarly, a customs case and a

00:19:41.337 --> 00:19:45.741
case about selling the book:
it was bought at City Lights

00:19:45.741 --> 00:19:50.182
bookstore in San Francisco,
and the poor sales clerk was

00:19:50.182 --> 00:19:53.902
indicted for selling it,
and also the bookstore was

00:19:53.902 --> 00:19:57.690
indicted for importing it.
It had been published in Europe.

00:19:57.690 --> 00:20:02.190
All they had to do in that
trial, and it's very funny to

00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:07.004
read the transcript,
is to prove that Ginsberg in

00:20:07.004 --> 00:20:13.248
Howl was doing anything
remotely resembling literary

00:20:13.248 --> 00:20:16.004
work.
And it's very funny to see

00:20:16.004 --> 00:20:18.920
people trying to argue that he
was not.

00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:22.872
So, it's not enough to say that
he uses the word "cock," for

00:20:22.872 --> 00:20:28.009
example, in that poem;
that's not enough.

00:20:28.009 --> 00:20:31.539
And the prosecutor tries to
make the case on the basis of

00:20:31.539 --> 00:20:34.375
individual words,
and then you see them having

00:20:34.375 --> 00:20:38.156
these hilarious conversations
about how individual words work

00:20:38.156 --> 00:20:41.559
in metaphors and how they mean
different things.

00:20:41.559 --> 00:20:46.674
This standard really saves
literature from any kind of

00:20:46.674 --> 00:20:52.287
continuing legal censorship.
But, there are other ways

00:20:52.287 --> 00:20:56.744
of producing censorship;
that "community standards"

00:20:56.744 --> 00:20:59.754
comes to be a problem in,
for example,

00:20:59.754 --> 00:21:03.672
textbook design.
So, there are these huge

00:21:03.672 --> 00:21:08.516
markets in public schools in
Florida and Texas and

00:21:08.516 --> 00:21:12.073
California,
and so textbook publishers have

00:21:12.073 --> 00:21:15.720
to appeal to the community
standards of those huge,

00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:19.000
powerful markets,
and that has an impact on

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:23.529
what's available to school
systems all over the country.

00:21:23.529 --> 00:21:27.943
So, there is a way that those
community standards,

00:21:27.943 --> 00:21:33.527
while in the Roth case they're
redeeming--they help to make the

00:21:33.527 --> 00:21:38.248
case against censorship,
against a too-wide definition

00:21:38.248 --> 00:21:42.492
of obscenity--it does have an
impact in other ways in the

00:21:42.492 --> 00:21:45.694
opposite direction.
Since the 1990s,

00:21:45.694 --> 00:21:50.873
in the wake of these changes,
libraries have become the

00:21:50.873 --> 00:21:55.190
primary place where legal cases
are based.

00:21:55.190 --> 00:22:01.717
So, in 1982 the school board of
Long Island, in Island Trees,

00:22:01.717 --> 00:22:05.089
Long Island,
tries to remove,

00:22:05.089 --> 00:22:08.000
or actually does remove
Black Boy,

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.720
Slaughterhouse 5,
and various other sort of

00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:16.365
books of the 1960s,
mainly about politics,

00:22:16.365 --> 00:22:22.569
mostly has them removed from
the school library.

00:22:22.569 --> 00:22:27.895
And a suit is brought against
that school system for doing

00:22:27.895 --> 00:22:31.096
that.
The decision in that case

00:22:31.096 --> 00:22:36.539
affirms that even though public
school systems are within their

00:22:36.539 --> 00:22:41.807
rights in the context of the
classroom to restrict what is on

00:22:41.807 --> 00:22:46.483
the syllabi of their teachers,
that the school library

00:22:46.483 --> 00:22:50.039
represents what they call a
"special environment."

00:22:50.039 --> 00:22:54.150
The special environment is a
place of voluntary study;

00:22:54.150 --> 00:22:57.729
it is a place where the
Fourteenth Amendment cannot be

00:22:57.729 --> 00:22:59.682
suspended.
And as they say,

00:22:59.682 --> 00:23:02.968
sort of poetically,
students do not leave their

00:23:02.968 --> 00:23:06.758
rights at the school door.
And so school libraries can't

00:23:06.758 --> 00:23:10.289
be regulated in that way.
But these things come up over

00:23:10.289 --> 00:23:14.475
and over, and what's interesting
about that particular case is

00:23:14.475 --> 00:23:18.730
that the objection was that
these books were anti-American.

00:23:18.730 --> 00:23:22.004
How far have we come since
Black Boy had to be

00:23:22.004 --> 00:23:23.762
truncated?
Not that far,

00:23:23.762 --> 00:23:27.774
in certain sectors of the
country, in certain ways of

00:23:27.774 --> 00:23:30.200
thinking.
Black Boy was cut in

00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:33.700
half because it didn't seem like
a good reflection on America.

00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:37.753
It's still a problem for some
books in being accepted and

00:23:37.753 --> 00:23:38.260
read.

00:23:44.289 --> 00:23:47.103
So, I began to talk about
market constraints,

00:23:47.103 --> 00:23:50.678
and I want to just say a little
bit more about that and how it

00:23:50.678 --> 00:23:54.019
affects the writing of
literature and the publishing,

00:23:54.019 --> 00:23:58.690
even before you arrive at the
bookstore.

00:23:58.690 --> 00:24:03.048
Traditional publishing has
undergone a huge consolidation

00:24:03.048 --> 00:24:05.672
since the 1980s.
So, there are large

00:24:05.672 --> 00:24:09.470
multinational corporations that
have bought up publishers.

00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:14.175
The one signal example of this
is when Bertelsmann,

00:24:14.175 --> 00:24:18.410
a German company,
bought up Pantheon Books.

00:24:18.410 --> 00:24:24.558
This is written about in a book.
Now I'm forgetting the name of

00:24:24.558 --> 00:24:29.349
it.
It'll come to me.

00:24:29.349 --> 00:24:35.180
One of the Pantheon editors led
a revolt when this happened.

00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:42.102
It became clear that
Bertelsmann was going to impose

00:24:42.102 --> 00:24:49.839
a new standard of profitability
on the lists in Pantheon's

00:24:49.839 --> 00:24:53.897
portfolio.
So it used to be in old-time

00:24:53.897 --> 00:24:58.829
publishing, sort of mid century
publishing and up to the 1980s,

00:24:58.829 --> 00:25:02.297
that the list,
a literature list (and that's

00:25:02.297 --> 00:25:06.330
the list of books that any
publisher publishes),

00:25:06.330 --> 00:25:14.045
the list should be profitable.
That does not mean that every

00:25:14.045 --> 00:25:18.009
single item on that list will be
profitable.

00:25:18.009 --> 00:25:24.499
So editors in the old-time mode
could work with writers who they

00:25:24.499 --> 00:25:28.619
found to be difficult and
interesting,

00:25:28.619 --> 00:25:32.044
path breaking,
unusual, not catering to what

00:25:32.044 --> 00:25:35.157
was popular.
They could work with writers

00:25:35.157 --> 00:25:39.295
and cultivate them and they knew
that they were taking on a

00:25:39.295 --> 00:25:42.720
book--say it's a collection of
short stories;

00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:47.057
these are notoriously hard to
sell--they were taking on a book

00:25:47.057 --> 00:25:49.759
that was not going to make a
profit.

00:25:49.759 --> 00:25:54.252
But then they would also take
on The Joy of Cooking--or

00:25:54.252 --> 00:25:58.327
The Joy of Sex,
 since it's censorship

00:25:58.327 --> 00:26:03.023
day--and they knew that the
profit from a popular book could

00:26:03.023 --> 00:26:07.559
help to carry and balance those
less profitable books,

00:26:07.559 --> 00:26:11.869
or not-at-all-profitable books,
that they had on the list.

00:26:11.869 --> 00:26:17.715
So, there was a management of
lists that could be tilted to

00:26:17.715 --> 00:26:23.359
allow different kinds of books
into the public domain.

00:26:23.359 --> 00:26:27.978
When publishers were taken
over by multinational

00:26:27.978 --> 00:26:32.960
corporations that were very
distant from the interaction

00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:38.885
between an editor and a writer,
they looked at the numbers and

00:26:38.885 --> 00:26:43.110
they started to demand that
every book have its

00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:48.620
profit-and-loss analysis and
that a very strict regulation be

00:26:48.620 --> 00:26:53.764
followed in ensuring that all
titles were going to make a

00:26:53.764 --> 00:26:56.861
profit.
That's a very different

00:26:56.861 --> 00:27:01.428
standard, and it had a huge
impact on what kind of latitude

00:27:01.428 --> 00:27:05.917
editors had in working with
writers who they thought might

00:27:05.917 --> 00:27:09.539
be a little unusual or not so
marketable.

00:27:09.539 --> 00:27:13.898
At the same time,
agents began to have a role in

00:27:13.898 --> 00:27:17.686
the publishing business.
In the 1950s,

00:27:17.686 --> 00:27:23.511
when editors were encouraging
literary writers directly,

00:27:23.511 --> 00:27:28.913
they had a much more
collaborative relationship with

00:27:28.913 --> 00:27:32.005
writers.
But as profit became more

00:27:32.005 --> 00:27:36.396
important writers needed to turn
to someone else who wasn't going

00:27:36.396 --> 00:27:39.210
to pressure them to follow the
market,

00:27:39.210 --> 00:27:43.960
and agents came to have a role.
Now, it's interesting.

00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:49.973
There is yet a third role that
has just begun to emerge in this

00:27:49.973 --> 00:27:53.660
structure, and that is of the
coach,

00:27:53.660 --> 00:27:57.107
the writing coach:
so you can now pay big bucks,

00:27:57.107 --> 00:28:00.629
if you're a writer,
to have someone who will call

00:28:00.629 --> 00:28:04.150
you up every week and say,
"Hey, how's the book going?

00:28:04.150 --> 00:28:08.359
Let's talk about your ideas.
Are you writing today?"

00:28:08.359 --> 00:28:12.930
It used to be that agents took
that kind of active role.

00:28:12.930 --> 00:28:16.751
Well, agents are very busy now,
with their clients selling

00:28:16.751 --> 00:28:22.016
movie rights and such things.
Movie rights are where a lot of

00:28:22.016 --> 00:28:25.819
the profit in a book sale come
from.

00:28:25.819 --> 00:28:29.715
So, agents began to be what the
old-time editor was,

00:28:29.715 --> 00:28:34.068
and I think we have yet to see
whether coaches become what

00:28:34.068 --> 00:28:38.592
agents used to be in turn.
But, as profitability becomes

00:28:38.592 --> 00:28:43.210
more and more of an issue in
selling a book to a publisher,

00:28:43.210 --> 00:28:50.120
there is an ever ongoing search
for that person who will be the

00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:56.474
ally of the literary in this
process.I've talked about

00:28:56.474 --> 00:29:00.710
the consolidation in book
selling,

00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:03.834
the rise of the chains,
and I've also talked about

00:29:03.834 --> 00:29:07.213
those financial relationships
between book sellers and

00:29:07.213 --> 00:29:09.430
publishers,
were space is bought.

00:29:09.430 --> 00:29:13.322
They also have incentives that
publishers give,

00:29:13.322 --> 00:29:17.385
sometimes give money for
readings to be held at a

00:29:17.385 --> 00:29:20.220
bookstore.
So, sometimes those things are

00:29:20.220 --> 00:29:23.300
bought also, those kinds of
events, promotional events.

00:29:30.089 --> 00:29:33.929
There is, of course,
this whole context of the rise

00:29:33.929 --> 00:29:37.308
of the internet,
and all kinds of competition

00:29:37.308 --> 00:29:40.380
from the film industry,
other media.

00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:45.633
Market constraints are
sometimes paradoxically produced

00:29:45.633 --> 00:29:50.400
by that overload that we get
from the internet.

00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:59.460
So what that means is the
culture is finding new arbiters.

00:29:59.460 --> 00:30:04.577
So, you have this huge volume
of information and cultural

00:30:04.577 --> 00:30:09.934
offerings being given to you.
In that welter of information

00:30:09.934 --> 00:30:14.983
we all look to some arbiter to
tell us, "How do I sort this

00:30:14.983 --> 00:30:18.323
out?"
Nobody has the time to read all

00:30:18.323 --> 00:30:23.779
the blogs and decide which one
they're going to read regularly.

00:30:23.779 --> 00:30:26.854
So you might get a link from
someone else's page,

00:30:26.854 --> 00:30:29.928
someone you are friends with,
someone you admire,

00:30:29.928 --> 00:30:33.922
a writer you've seen elsewhere.
You might read certain print

00:30:33.922 --> 00:30:37.551
publications and from there
follow them in to the internet,

00:30:37.551 --> 00:30:40.624
into cyberspace.
Most books now come with a web

00:30:40.624 --> 00:30:43.440
address somewhere on them.
A lot of films do;

00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:48.520
most films do.
This is still in a period of

00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:52.183
development.
How profit gets connected up

00:30:52.183 --> 00:30:57.097
with those arbiters isn't yet
very clear, so companies are

00:30:57.097 --> 00:31:00.890
experimenting with paying for
placements,

00:31:00.890 --> 00:31:04.461
like when you do the Google
search and there are certain

00:31:04.461 --> 00:31:06.799
Google-sponsored links at the
top.

00:31:06.799 --> 00:31:11.832
That's like having the space in
the front of your store bought

00:31:11.832 --> 00:31:14.280
and paid for.
So you think that you're

00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:17.559
getting--or, I think we all know
that those are sponsored links,

00:31:17.559 --> 00:31:21.188
now, but at the beginning
people didn't really quite know

00:31:21.188 --> 00:31:24.947
that, so it looked like you were
getting-- the product of a

00:31:24.947 --> 00:31:29.548
disinterested electronic search,
but in fact you were getting a

00:31:29.548 --> 00:31:32.560
promotion.
So the internet experiments

00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:37.243
with all kinds of both new and
tried and true ways of using

00:31:37.243 --> 00:31:42.250
money to create prominence among
the welter of information.

00:31:42.250 --> 00:31:46.397
Then there is another
rising problem in question,

00:31:46.397 --> 00:31:51.103
and that is of intellectual
property and access as books are

00:31:51.103 --> 00:31:53.683
digitized.
So, I don't know if you have

00:31:53.683 --> 00:31:56.244
heard of the Google Book
Project, and also all the

00:31:56.244 --> 00:31:59.817
digital libraries initiatives.
There are various ones,

00:31:59.817 --> 00:32:04.235
but the Google Book Project is
digitizing with a special

00:32:04.235 --> 00:32:07.068
technology.
People think it's probably a

00:32:07.068 --> 00:32:10.731
robotic technology--it's kept
secret--for scanning books that

00:32:10.731 --> 00:32:14.033
are in the public domain,
and they've made agreements

00:32:14.033 --> 00:32:17.220
with lots of university
libraries including Stanford,

00:32:17.220 --> 00:32:20.964
Cornell, Michigan,
to digitize all the books that

00:32:20.964 --> 00:32:25.723
are beyond the copyright that
are in their collections to make

00:32:25.723 --> 00:32:30.383
a huge digital library.
And the dream is that this will

00:32:30.383 --> 00:32:34.760
be a sort of bonanza of access.
It'll be searchable.

00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:39.621
It'll be--well, maybe--free.
It'll be accessible all over

00:32:39.621 --> 00:32:43.628
the world.
So, there is a dream here

00:32:43.628 --> 00:32:48.181
that's very noble.
Publishers and writers' groups,

00:32:48.181 --> 00:32:52.619
unions, are very worried about
copyright infringement,

00:32:52.619 --> 00:32:57.958
because Google has stepped over
the line and is interested in

00:32:57.958 --> 00:33:03.119
pushing the envelope into
scanning copyrighted material.

00:33:03.119 --> 00:33:08.558
So, what has started to happen
is that individual publishers

00:33:08.558 --> 00:33:14.089
have made deals with Google to
let Google digitize their list

00:33:14.089 --> 00:33:18.133
for a fee.
But, see, now that money starts

00:33:18.133 --> 00:33:23.195
to come into this arrangement,
it starts to look less like

00:33:23.195 --> 00:33:27.369
free access and more like an
access that is,

00:33:27.369 --> 00:33:31.990
once again, shaped by these
financial considerations.

00:33:31.990 --> 00:33:36.365
It's not at all clear how the
nobility of the project and the

00:33:36.365 --> 00:33:40.230
financial context are going to
work themselves out,

00:33:40.230 --> 00:33:43.796
and it's not at all clear yet
what the general approach of

00:33:43.796 --> 00:33:46.799
educational institutions will be
towards this.

00:33:46.799 --> 00:33:50.208
Yale has not signed onto this,
for example,

00:33:50.208 --> 00:33:56.009
so some universities have;
some haven't.

00:33:56.009 --> 00:33:59.575
These are huge,
looming questions that will

00:33:59.575 --> 00:34:03.140
impact what we get to see as
literature,

00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:08.099
how much access we have among
the vast choices that the

00:34:08.099 --> 00:34:13.441
internet makes available to us.
I want to just mention one

00:34:13.441 --> 00:34:17.369
more thing, and that's about
internationalization.

00:34:17.369 --> 00:34:23.528
One thing that you didn't
probably see at the bookstore is

00:34:23.528 --> 00:34:28.411
fiction in translation,
contemporary fiction in

00:34:28.411 --> 00:34:32.679
translation, notoriously
impossible to sell.

00:34:32.679 --> 00:34:38.309
There is a press called the New
Press that was founded after

00:34:38.309 --> 00:34:43.461
some of the Pantheon editors
left and they founded this

00:34:43.461 --> 00:34:46.778
nonprofit press.
That is the only kind of

00:34:46.778 --> 00:34:50.123
fiction that the New Press
publishes, contemporary fiction

00:34:50.123 --> 00:34:53.410
in translation,
because they knew that only a

00:34:53.410 --> 00:34:56.180
nonprofit press could publish
this.

00:34:56.180 --> 00:34:59.689
It will never sell.
One of the objections to the

00:34:59.689 --> 00:35:03.260
Google Book Project is that the
vast majority of its texts are

00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:06.523
in English,
and it seems to present an

00:35:06.523 --> 00:35:11.130
English-centric vision of the
world's knowledge,

00:35:11.130 --> 00:35:15.004
'cause it does have pretensions
to be the repository of the

00:35:15.004 --> 00:35:17.447
world's knowledge.
In the reception of

00:35:17.447 --> 00:35:20.240
literature there are other
forces, and here's when we start

00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:22.599
to move in to the realm of
The Human Stain.

00:35:22.599 --> 00:35:26.425
In the 1990s,
there was a very lively and

00:35:26.425 --> 00:35:31.467
often acrimonious debate in
academia and among intellectual

00:35:31.467 --> 00:35:36.335
commentators about whether
literature was the purveyor of

00:35:36.335 --> 00:35:38.650
ideology,
political ideology.

00:35:42.010 --> 00:35:44.372
So, the question is,
does literature have a message

00:35:44.372 --> 00:35:48.560
that it's trying to tell us?
And one way to think about this

00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:53.029
is to think about English 125,
major British poets,

00:35:53.029 --> 00:35:57.766
the picture of what the
old-fashioned canon might look

00:35:57.766 --> 00:36:02.010
like.
It's all white guys.

00:36:02.010 --> 00:36:05.107
I think there might be one
woman that you can put on the

00:36:05.107 --> 00:36:07.360
syllabus in the Spring,
a modern poet.

00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:11.361
You can probably teach Bishop.
I think people do teach Bishop

00:36:11.361 --> 00:36:13.579
in the second term of English
125.

00:36:13.579 --> 00:36:17.670
Did those poets represent the
communication of an ideology?

00:36:21.969 --> 00:36:26.464
Because a lot of contemporary
fiction became the object of

00:36:26.464 --> 00:36:30.880
contention: along with these
very traditional syllabi,

00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:33.579
are you going to include Toni
Morrison on your syllabus?

00:36:33.579 --> 00:36:38.039
Well, this is no longer
controversial.

00:36:38.039 --> 00:36:40.858
She's such an overwhelmingly
powerful author,

00:36:40.858 --> 00:36:43.420
at this time,
by the sheer quality of her

00:36:43.420 --> 00:36:47.519
work, but early in her career it
would have been a question.

00:36:47.519 --> 00:36:50.177
One of the striking things,
of course, about American

00:36:50.177 --> 00:36:52.739
fiction in the second half of
the twentieth century,

00:36:52.739 --> 00:36:55.824
and into the twenty-first,
is the demographic really does

00:36:55.824 --> 00:36:58.332
change.
Writers of color are much more

00:36:58.332 --> 00:37:02.834
prominent;
there are many more points of

00:37:02.834 --> 00:37:07.980
view present in that canon.
So, is literature sociological?

00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:13.147
Does it speak to society,
or is it an aesthetic object,

00:37:13.147 --> 00:37:17.836
something that we should
understand as part of the

00:37:17.836 --> 00:37:21.927
history of an art form?
Do you have to choose between

00:37:21.927 --> 00:37:24.442
these two?
And I cite here what became an

00:37:24.442 --> 00:37:28.467
incredibly important book.
It's really a wonderful book by

00:37:28.467 --> 00:37:31.480
actually a Yale graduate,
John Guillory.

00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:34.804
The title is Cultural
Capital: The Problem of Literary

00:37:34.804 --> 00:37:37.851
Canon Formation,
published right at the

00:37:37.851 --> 00:37:41.000
height of the culture wars,
of the canon wars.

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:46.168
In it, he argues that in the
mid twentieth century,

00:37:46.168 --> 00:37:50.820
literature was a kind of social
elite good,

00:37:50.820 --> 00:37:54.976
and that the aesthetic,
if it had an ideology,

00:37:54.976 --> 00:37:59.039
it was an ideology of bourgeois
privilege.

00:37:59.039 --> 00:38:03.109
So, it wasn't that the content
of particular poems would be

00:38:03.109 --> 00:38:07.320
communicating something about an
elite bourgeois ideology,

00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:11.034
but rather that the very act of
being in the institution where

00:38:11.034 --> 00:38:13.469
you would study such a thing (at
Yale,

00:38:13.469 --> 00:38:20.070
in English 125) that was the
repository of the elite power of

00:38:20.070 --> 00:38:23.387
these texts.
So it had much more to do with

00:38:23.387 --> 00:38:26.882
institutions than it did about
the content of any particular

00:38:26.882 --> 00:38:29.790
literary work.
And it makes some very

00:38:29.790 --> 00:38:34.800
persuasive readings of canonical
poems that demonstrate the

00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:37.909
undecidability of their
ideology,

00:38:37.909 --> 00:38:41.166
or the way that they resist how
they've been cast,

00:38:41.166 --> 00:38:44.090
how those poems have been cast
by critics.

00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:54.420
There are also ways that
novels were received and

00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:59.340
complained about that become
part of this picture.

00:38:59.340 --> 00:39:01.320
So, we've talked about Black
Boy.

00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:05.763
I mentioned how
controversial Woman Warrior

00:39:05.763 --> 00:39:10.480
was because of its impurity
as a Chinese text.

00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:15.692
Toni Morrison became a real
advocate of writing by women of

00:39:15.692 --> 00:39:20.275
color, in particular,
and also as a literary critic

00:39:20.275 --> 00:39:25.219
she mounted an argument about
how whiteness functions as a

00:39:25.219 --> 00:39:29.989
central part of the traditional
canon of literature.

00:39:29.989 --> 00:39:34.433
And she wrote Playing in the
Dark: Whiteness and the Literary

00:39:34.433 --> 00:39:38.030
Imagination in 1992,
a very influential text.

00:39:38.030 --> 00:39:41.560
Internationally,
we had the phenomenon of Salman

00:39:41.560 --> 00:39:45.541
Rushdie's persecution,
the fatwa issued against him by

00:39:45.541 --> 00:39:50.123
the Ayatollah Khomeini after the
publication of The Satanic

00:39:50.123 --> 00:39:53.690
Verses,
for its depiction of Islam.

00:39:53.690 --> 00:39:59.261
That kind of persecution
becomes a feature of this more

00:39:59.261 --> 00:40:04.730
internationalized debate about
what is okay to say,

00:40:04.730 --> 00:40:08.400
especially about religions,
and then of course we have the

00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:11.923
Danish cartoon episode,
with the cartoons of Muhammad

00:40:11.923 --> 00:40:14.960
that are now
seemingly…it's resurgent.

00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:19.575
There is another question about
a film about Muhammad's life,

00:40:19.575 --> 00:40:22.692
I believe it is.
Then there is Roth's work,

00:40:22.692 --> 00:40:26.889
and here's where I just want to
meditate for a minute on Roth.

00:40:26.889 --> 00:40:30.794
Philip Roth's work has been
defined by these kinds of

00:40:30.794 --> 00:40:34.420
objections, that censure that I
was talking about.

00:40:34.420 --> 00:40:38.623
He was very widely acclaimed in
1960 when Goodbye,

00:40:38.623 --> 00:40:42.099
Columbus won the National
Book Award.

00:40:42.099 --> 00:40:47.239
Goodbye, Columbus is a
set of stories mostly about

00:40:47.239 --> 00:40:52.837
young Jewish protagonists living
in a Jewish context in Jewish

00:40:52.837 --> 00:40:56.599
communities in Newark or in New
York.

00:40:56.599 --> 00:41:01.958
It included a story called "The
Conversion of the Jews" in which

00:41:01.958 --> 00:41:05.847
a young boy (actually,
well, a little older than young

00:41:05.847 --> 00:41:08.530
boy, maybe he's a teenager),
Ozzie Freedman,

00:41:08.530 --> 00:41:14.220
becomes extremely agitated
because all his questions to his

00:41:14.220 --> 00:41:20.010
family and to his rabbi about
Christianity are dismissed;

00:41:20.010 --> 00:41:21.731
he finally comes to be punished
for asking these kinds of

00:41:21.731 --> 00:41:24.502
questions.
So, Ozzie stages his revolt by

00:41:24.502 --> 00:41:28.987
climbing to the top of the
synagogue roof and threatening

00:41:28.987 --> 00:41:33.403
to jump off if his family,
all the assembled students from

00:41:33.403 --> 00:41:35.564
his Hebrew school,
and the rabbi,

00:41:35.564 --> 00:41:38.130
won't kneel down and pray to
Jesus,

00:41:38.130 --> 00:41:42.590
which of course they do because
he's about to jump off.

00:41:42.590 --> 00:41:46.083
This story was quite
controversial,

00:41:46.083 --> 00:41:51.323
as you might imagine,
so there was a taste of Roth's

00:41:51.323 --> 00:41:57.179
vexed relationship to Jewish
community in that story.

00:41:57.179 --> 00:42:01.677
So, it was all about how a
hidebound Jewish community was

00:42:01.677 --> 00:42:05.934
preventing and circumscribing
the curiosity of a young

00:42:05.934 --> 00:42:09.300
American boy,
and it really highlighted

00:42:09.300 --> 00:42:13.239
Ozzie's Americanness.
And Roth has always emphasized

00:42:13.239 --> 00:42:16.289
that about himself:
He's an American

00:42:16.289 --> 00:42:20.575
writer.Like Saul Bellow
before him--Saul Bellow had been

00:42:20.575 --> 00:42:24.860
his mentor and teacher for a
brief time at the University of

00:42:24.860 --> 00:42:28.419
Chicago--Bellow insisted on
bringing into American

00:42:28.419 --> 00:42:32.124
literature the voice and
sensibility of an immigrant

00:42:32.124 --> 00:42:35.842
Jewish family.
Bellow was from a Russian

00:42:35.842 --> 00:42:40.483
Jewish family that immigrated to
Canada in the early twentieth

00:42:40.483 --> 00:42:42.732
century.
Bellow was told he would

00:42:42.732 --> 00:42:46.205
neve--because of his heritage,
when he was at the University

00:42:46.205 --> 00:42:49.913
of Chicago--he was told he would
never have the ear for language

00:42:49.913 --> 00:42:52.679
that would allow him to write
beautifully,

00:42:52.679 --> 00:42:56.914
because of his linguistic
background and because he was

00:42:56.914 --> 00:43:00.119
Jewish.
Well, Bellow pioneered the way

00:43:00.119 --> 00:43:04.952
of bringing in a particularly
Jewish and European notion of

00:43:04.952 --> 00:43:09.867
literature and a sensibility
about the body that could enter

00:43:09.867 --> 00:43:14.783
American literature and change
it from its either WASPish or

00:43:14.783 --> 00:43:18.587
southern genteel quality.
And, certainly,

00:43:18.587 --> 00:43:22.227
this was a very powerful
current, and Roth is the

00:43:22.227 --> 00:43:26.170
continuation of that current in
American letters.

00:43:26.170 --> 00:43:30.610
Roth comes out in 1969 with
Portnoy's Complaint.

00:43:30.610 --> 00:43:34.739
Portnoy is quite a novel.
It's really all about

00:43:34.739 --> 00:43:38.219
masturbation.
It's about Alex Portnoy jacking

00:43:38.219 --> 00:43:42.748
off in the bathroom to every
possible provocative thought he

00:43:42.748 --> 00:43:46.628
can have,
and it's told as if to Alex's

00:43:46.628 --> 00:43:52.240
psychiatrist in a sort of
ranting, over-the-top style,

00:43:52.240 --> 00:43:58.083
very explicit.
This got Roth into big trouble,

00:43:58.083 --> 00:44:04.110
partly because Alex lives in a
very tight-knit Jewish family,

00:44:04.110 --> 00:44:09.840
and this enters into the whole
story of his obsession with sex.

00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:12.673
Irving Howe,
a very prominent Jewish

00:44:12.673 --> 00:44:15.587
literary critic,
public intellectual,

00:44:15.587 --> 00:44:19.391
wrote a famous essay in 1972
called "Philip Roth

00:44:19.391 --> 00:44:23.519
Reconsidered." And he
basically said that the

00:44:23.519 --> 00:44:28.133
adulation given to Roth was
entirely inappropriate--he now

00:44:28.133 --> 00:44:32.150
saw on reflection,
now that he had read

00:44:32.150 --> 00:44:35.915
Portnoy's
Complaint--because Roth had

00:44:35.915 --> 00:44:40.730
an unfocused hostility towards
the Jewish community.

00:44:40.730 --> 00:44:48.326
This enraged Roth.
That rage fueled huge portions

00:44:48.326 --> 00:44:53.077
of his career.
When, in The Human Stain,

00:44:53.077 --> 00:44:57.293
Roth has Coleman Silk say,
"All of Western literature

00:44:57.293 --> 00:45:01.771
began with a quarrel,
the wrath of Achilles," in a

00:45:01.771 --> 00:45:07.210
certain way he is describing his
own origin as a writer.

00:45:07.210 --> 00:45:11.890
Now, if you'll go with me:
Do you have just five minutes?

00:45:11.890 --> 00:45:17.180
I want to get to one last point.
Roth, in case you haven't

00:45:17.180 --> 00:45:20.130
noticed, is a very misogynist
writer.

00:45:20.130 --> 00:45:25.740
Did you notice?
Hard to miss that.

00:45:25.740 --> 00:45:31.446
Why do I like Roth?
In this context where writers

00:45:31.446 --> 00:45:36.137
are taken to task for their
offensiveness on cultural

00:45:36.137 --> 00:45:38.665
grounds,
on gender grounds,

00:45:38.665 --> 00:45:41.394
on the grounds of
identification,

00:45:41.394 --> 00:45:45.829
how can you like someone who
has this major flaw,

00:45:45.829 --> 00:45:48.971
who seems to see all women as
sexual objects,

00:45:48.971 --> 00:45:52.898
who is unembarrassed about
saying his writing is about a

00:45:52.898 --> 00:45:55.739
man's life,
the life of men;

00:45:55.739 --> 00:45:59.580
it's not about the life of
women?

00:45:59.580 --> 00:46:02.682
So, why do I like Roth?
This has actually baffled me

00:46:02.682 --> 00:46:05.300
for years.
Why doesn't it bother me?

00:46:05.300 --> 00:46:10.372
There are parts in The Human
Stain that really are quite

00:46:10.372 --> 00:46:15.137
amazingly objectionable.
My favorite is the gift of the

00:46:15.137 --> 00:46:17.614
molestation.
Do you remember this when they

00:46:17.614 --> 00:46:20.059
are talking about Faunia,
and how great she is in bed,

00:46:20.059 --> 00:46:23.052
and what she is like at
breakfast afterwards,

00:46:23.052 --> 00:46:25.840
and they speculate,
Coleman and Nathan,

00:46:25.840 --> 00:46:30.369
that maybe that was the gift of
her having been molested?

00:46:30.369 --> 00:46:33.710
Well, molestation is never a
gift.

00:46:33.710 --> 00:46:37.678
If there is anything that comes
from living through a hard life,

00:46:37.678 --> 00:46:41.269
it is not the gift of the
molestation, but the gift of the

00:46:41.269 --> 00:46:44.930
person who survived it.
This is insane.

00:46:44.930 --> 00:46:49.878
Why do I still like Roth?
Well, partly it's that,

00:46:49.878 --> 00:46:54.276
like no one else,
he can take me into a voice,

00:46:54.276 --> 00:46:58.989
seamlessly draw me in.
Some of his ranting voices are

00:46:58.989 --> 00:47:02.263
more or less convincing.
Some are more or less

00:47:02.263 --> 00:47:05.137
caricatured;
of course the women's are more

00:47:05.137 --> 00:47:07.936
caricatured than the men's.
Nevertheless,

00:47:07.936 --> 00:47:11.743
he can take me in there,
and the way his sentences work

00:47:11.743 --> 00:47:15.480
are really sometimes just
astonishingly beautiful.

00:47:15.480 --> 00:47:18.392
There is a part of The Human
Stain that I particularly

00:47:18.392 --> 00:47:21.500
like, and you'll get to it as
you finish the novel for Monday,

00:47:21.500 --> 00:47:24.675
and that's when he's describing
Coleman and Faunia at

00:47:24.675 --> 00:47:27.657
Tanglewood.
So, just think about that when

00:47:27.657 --> 00:47:30.940
you read that,
pause for a minute over that.

00:47:30.940 --> 00:47:34.802
I think what it is ultimately
is that I'm very moved by two

00:47:34.802 --> 00:47:38.869
things in Roth's writing;
that is the meditation on

00:47:38.869 --> 00:47:43.226
mortality and what goes along
with that, I think:

00:47:43.226 --> 00:47:47.219
the focus on and the dignity of
the body.

00:47:47.219 --> 00:47:51.768
There is a very Whitmanian
sense to his understanding of

00:47:51.768 --> 00:47:55.160
sex and the body in all its
complexity.

00:47:55.160 --> 00:48:01.067
I appreciate that.
I am moved by that sense of the

00:48:01.067 --> 00:48:05.440
inaccessibility of the other
person--this is from my lecture

00:48:05.440 --> 00:48:09.591
on Monday--the way you always
get the other fellow's life

00:48:09.591 --> 00:48:12.360
somehow wrong.
That speaks to me about the

00:48:12.360 --> 00:48:14.729
difference between my
consciousness and anyone I

00:48:14.729 --> 00:48:19.878
encounter in the world.
That to me is profound and

00:48:19.878 --> 00:48:22.220
moving.
It reminds me that,

00:48:22.220 --> 00:48:25.517
for all Roth's linguistic
energy and skill as a writer,

00:48:25.517 --> 00:48:28.875
there is still that great
divide that language is trying

00:48:28.875 --> 00:48:31.801
to cross.
And that's what I appreciate

00:48:31.801 --> 00:48:36.166
about literature in general,
that it's that great attempt to

00:48:36.166 --> 00:48:39.538
cross that divide.
I can overlook the misogyny for

00:48:39.538 --> 00:48:43.119
those things.
Am I like Roth?

00:48:43.119 --> 00:48:49.110
Probably not,
but that's why I like him.

00:48:49.110 --> 00:48:55.148
I read to see what I'm not,
not to see what I am,

00:48:55.148 --> 00:49:00.179
and so Roth's very difference
from me,

00:49:00.179 --> 00:49:03.131
his misogyny,
is part of what allows me to

00:49:03.131 --> 00:49:06.369
feel that I am entering,
however partially,

00:49:06.369 --> 00:49:11.473
however always in a compromised
way, into the consciousness of

00:49:11.473 --> 00:49:14.820
another person through that
beautiful,

00:49:14.820 --> 00:49:20.601
amazing medium of language.
So, that's why I like Roth,

00:49:20.601 --> 00:49:23.934
and I would encourage you to
think about your own responses

00:49:23.934 --> 00:49:26.289
to the books that we've read
together,

00:49:26.289 --> 00:49:31.252
think about what it means about
you as a reader that you respond

00:49:31.252 --> 00:49:34.090
in certain ways.
So we'll pick this up on Monday;

00:49:34.090 --> 00:49:35.690
thank you for waiting.

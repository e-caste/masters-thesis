00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.100
Now you remember from
last week that we're in the

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.500
moment of phasing
out of the 1960s,

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:21.667
moving into the
1970s, but of course,

00:00:21.667 --> 00:00:23.767
human actions,
inactions, chronology,

00:00:23.767 --> 00:00:26.000
is not simply as
neat as dates on a,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.367
on a calendar as a
timeline.&nbsp; A lot of the

00:00:28.367 --> 00:00:34.300
social confusion, violence,
and cultural excitement

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.600
actually, of this era,
of the late sixties,

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.900
is right there in the
1970s.&nbsp; And this lecture's

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.500
actually trying to canvass
some of the political

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.567
turmoil and its, its
marriage to popular culture

00:00:47.567 --> 00:00:52.300
in the early 1970s.&nbsp; By
way of context though,

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:57.900
let me start in the spring
of 1970.&nbsp; On April 30th--and

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.067
actually, let
me focus--it's,

00:01:00.067 --> 00:01:03.300
frankly, just focus on two
weeks in 1970.&nbsp; On April

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.800
30th, President Nixon
announces the invasion of

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.667
Cambodia, escalation of
the war in Southeast Asia in

00:01:11.667 --> 00:01:16.300
general, and the need
for one hundred and fifty

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.800
thousand more troops to
find a lasting peace.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.000
In response, the campus
at Kent State in Ohio,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.800
the ROTC building is set
on fire.&nbsp; The Ohio governor

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.367
dispatches National Guard
to make sure that the campus

00:01:33.367 --> 00:01:40.200
remains
peaceful.&nbsp; On to May 4th,

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.300
this attempt to keep
the peace on Kent State

00:01:44.367 --> 00:01:49.000
evaporates, when
twenty-eight Guardsmen open

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.700
fire on Kent State students,
killing four and wounding

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:59.300
nine.&nbsp;
Immediately--immediately

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.867
being a day--five hundred
colleges are shut down

00:02:03.867 --> 00:02:07.167
across the country, or
they're disrupted from

00:02:07.167 --> 00:02:12.367
protests.&nbsp; Our country,
according to college

00:02:12.367 --> 00:02:18.367
protestors, our country is
now attacking us.&nbsp; It makes

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:26.467
tremendous
headlines.&nbsp; On May 14th,

00:02:26.467 --> 00:02:28.500
ten days--[student sneezes]
bless you--ten days after

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:35.000
Kent State, at
Jackson State University,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.300
a historically
black university,

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.700
during a student protest,
state and highway patrolmen

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.200
open fire with automatic
weapons into dormitories.&nbsp;

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.267
Allegations are that someone
was sniping at them.&nbsp; No

00:02:47.267 --> 00:02:49.600
evidence was
ever found to that,

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:55.767
to that end.&nbsp; They opened
fire without any warning,

00:02:55.767 --> 00:03:01.400
killed two students and
wounded nine.&nbsp; The scale of

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.700
national attention is
not commensurate with what

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.600
happens at Kent
State.&nbsp; So for,

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.500
in the African
American community,

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.800
there is a sense
that the police state,

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.500
in this case, state
and highway patrolmen,

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.500
could kill our college
students without anybody

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.600
worrying too much,
but at Kent State,

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.700
also inexcusable, that
if you kill the students,

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.100
it becomes a national
catastrophe.&nbsp; Meanwhile,

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.000
in New Haven, just about
two blocks from here--well,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.700
actually, all throughout
New Haven--the Black Panther

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:46.467
Party and the FBI are at a
standoff.&nbsp; Black Panther

00:03:46.467 --> 00:03:50.000
Party and fellow travelers
had come to New Haven,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.267
essentially to protest the
murder trial of Bobby Seale,

00:03:55.267 --> 00:03:59.700
who's accused of authorizing
the murder of Alex Rackley,

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.100
member of the
Black Panther Party,

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:06.600
people believed to have been
an informant to the FBI.&nbsp;

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.700
Fifteen thousand people
descend upon the Green,

00:04:11.567 --> 00:04:15.200
Panthers,
Panther supporters,

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.300
sort of anarchist
hippies, called the Yippies,

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:21.300
by--led by Abbie Hoffman,
fellow travel--travelers of

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:24.567
all sorts.&nbsp; And there was a
real fear that the city is

00:04:24.567 --> 00:04:30.100
going to be collapsed into a
race riot.&nbsp; The university,

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:31.500
under the leadership
of Kingman Brewster,

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.200
the president at the time,
does something that people

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:36.667
never expected, and actually
opened its doors to the

00:04:36.667 --> 00:04:41.500
Black Panthers.&nbsp; It
created a mechanism,

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.500
it felt--Brewster felt, that
would relieve some of the

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:52.900
pent-up anxiety and tension
over what's happening around

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:57.667
the country and then
locally.&nbsp; Classes are

00:04:57.667 --> 00:05:00.200
canceled; there's student
strikes.&nbsp; I think two or

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.800
three pipe bombs go off at
Ingalls Rink.&nbsp; It's a level

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:09.100
of chaos that you, that
you are not familiar with.&nbsp;

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:13.067
Kingman Brewster declares
that he actually doubts--and

00:05:13.067 --> 00:05:15.467
I'm paraphrasing
here--whether a black person

00:05:15.467 --> 00:05:19.100
can get a fair trial
anywhere in America.&nbsp;

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:20.900
Immediately, the
alums start phoning in,

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:25.067
calling for his resignation,
for his outlandish

00:05:25.067 --> 00:05:28.367
statement.&nbsp; It's
a national event,

00:05:28.367 --> 00:05:34.100
student unrest; it's a local
story as well.&nbsp; In this

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:41.600
spirit of what's going on in
the country on the college

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:45.400
campuses, and the
nation, the call for federal

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.300
troops--excuse me, for
more military troops,

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:53.167
the invasion of Cambodia,
you have an astonishing,

00:05:53.167 --> 00:05:58.867
almost sort of a call
and response by a lot of

00:05:58.867 --> 00:06:02.900
cultural artists.&nbsp; Most
famous in this regard--well,

00:06:06.867 --> 00:06:10.567
most famous to me at least,
in this regard--is Marvin

00:06:10.567 --> 00:06:17.100
Gaye.&nbsp; Marvin Gaye, who had
made a career at Motown by

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:21.800
piecing together and
performing love songs,

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:25.300
branches out a year later in
May of 1971 with something

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:26.800
really quite different.&nbsp;
So he's known for,

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:30.100
for this: [Marvin
Gaye, Tammi Terrell,

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:34.800
"Ain't No Mountain High
Enough" excerpt plays.]

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:38.800
Listen, baby Ain't no mountain
high Ain't no valley low

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:42.800
Aint no river wide enough,

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:49.467
baby If you need me, call me
No matter where you are

00:06:49.467 --> 00:06:53.467
No matter how
far Don't worry,

00:06:53.467 --> 00:06:57.767
baby I mean, really
catchy love songs,

00:06:57.767 --> 00:07:00.100
really quite--you know,
they're actually important

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:05.200
in the history of the
evolution of rock music and

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:10.767
the Motown sound.&nbsp; But
by--when we get into 1970,

00:07:10.767 --> 00:07:15.000
Gaye is
wrestling with, well,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.300
partly exhaustion
from churning out these

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:23.300
saccharine-laden songs,
but also he's wrestling with

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:24.567
what's going on
in the country,

00:07:24.567 --> 00:07:27.900
and he wants to aspire to do
something quite different.&nbsp;

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:33.467
And he earns, secures
himself a new contract with

00:07:33.467 --> 00:07:35.600
Motown and he's
given creative license,

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:37.900
which is astonishing.&nbsp; This
is the big sort of rupture

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:40.600
in Motown.&nbsp; He's
given creative license,

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:43.667
and he turns--and he
generates a concept album.&nbsp;

00:07:43.667 --> 00:07:49.200
The album's called What's
Going On?&nbsp; It's dealing with

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:52.700
Vietnam, it's dealing
with economic despair,

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:57.067
with incredible inflation
going on in the country.&nbsp;

00:07:57.067 --> 00:07:59.100
It's dealing with
ecological despair,

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:01.700
and this is a few years
before Earth Day would

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:03.900
actually take effect, when
people are wondering what

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:07.900
we're doing to this
particular planet.&nbsp; In fact,

00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:12.000
I've often, when I've given
this lecture--and I wanted,

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.300
I hadn't given a, a cultural
politics lecture for years,

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:16.867
and I finally realized it
was time to do so.&nbsp; And I

00:08:16.867 --> 00:08:18.700
listened to What's Going On?

00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:20.000
Just to see if I
wanted to play a clip,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.467
and I realized, I could
actually just put the CD on,

00:08:22.467 --> 00:08:24.500
leave the room, have
you guys understand the

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:28.200
nineteen, early 1970s by the
time the album was over.&nbsp;

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:33.100
But, well, I have to get up
and say something.&nbsp; So you

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:36.700
have a moment of
escalating war in Vietnam,

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:39.900
fear of, of
destruction of the planet,

00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:43.067
ecologically speaking,
environmentally speaking,

00:08:43.067 --> 00:08:44.900
hyperinflation in
the United States,

00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:52.300
poverty, urban decay.&nbsp; And
Marvin Gaye starts writing

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:56.100
these pieces, or produces
these songs.&nbsp; They merge one

00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:57.500
into another in
What's Going On?

00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:59.600
and, in fact, if you do want
to learn about the 1970s,

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:02.400
just go out and--I used to
say buy the album at the

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:04.200
record store, then
you could buy the CD,

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:06.467
and now it's just,
you know, go to iTunes,

00:09:06.467 --> 00:09:11.500
I suppose.&nbsp; Although you
should patronize Cutler's,

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:19.500
the local record store.&nbsp;
[Students laugh]&nbsp; One of his

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:21.700
signature songs
from the album,

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:22.700
"What's Happening,
Brother?"&nbsp; It's the story of

00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:26.200
a returning vet,
comes back from Vietnam,

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:29.700
trying to figure out what
is happening on the street,

00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:33.000
really trying to get back
into the mundane routine

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
of life.

00:09:36.167 --> 00:09:37.167
I'll play a clip of it.

00:09:37.167 --> 00:09:43.600
Hey baby, what you know good
I'm just getting back,

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:48.800
but you knew I
would War is hell,

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:54.667
when will it end, When
will people start getting

00:09:54.667 --> 00:09:59.100
together again, Are things
really getting better,

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:05.700
like the newspaper said
Whatelse is new my friend,

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:10.867
besides what I read,
Can't find no work,

00:10:10.867 --> 00:10:17.500
can't find no job my friend,
Money is tighter than

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:23.367
it's ever been Say man, I
just don't understand

00:10:23.367 --> 00:10:29.267
What's going on across this land
Ah what's happening brother,

00:10:29.267 --> 00:10:35.100
Oh yeah, what's happening,
what's happening my man?

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:42.500
If you have the lyrics
sheet in front of you,

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:48.400
it's self-evident.&nbsp; For
those of you who don't,

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:55.067
the guy's just come back
from war.&nbsp; He's wondering,

00:10:55.067 --> 00:10:56.200
if he's reading
the newspaper,

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:57.200
if what he's
reading is true,

00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:58.300
and he's talking
about civil rights here,

00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:01.267
of things actually getting
better.&nbsp; Can't find a job

00:11:01.267 --> 00:11:03.700
though, money is tight.&nbsp;
"I don't understand what's

00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:07.967
going on around here."&nbsp;
And then just wondering,

00:11:07.967 --> 00:11:10.500
you know, are they still
doing stuff they used to do,

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:14.167
going to the dances?&nbsp; Do you
think anybody has a chance

00:11:14.167 --> 00:11:17.100
to succeed, in this case, a
ball club?&nbsp; "I want to know

00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:20.167
what's going on, what's
happening."&nbsp; Someone who's

00:11:20.167 --> 00:11:23.700
lost and trying to
find his way.&nbsp; Very soon,

00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:25.300
you get an answer
in the same album,

00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:29.700
in the song "Inner City
Blues."&nbsp; Harkening back to

00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:32.300
Gil Scott-Heron,
"Whitey on the Moon."

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:38.400
Dah, dah, dah,
dah, dah, dah, dah

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:45.600
Rockets, moon shots
Spend it on the have nots.

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:49.700
Money, we make it;

00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:56.900
'Fore we see it you take it.

00:11:56.900 --> 00:12:02.900
Oh, make me wanna holler
The way they do my life.

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:13.100
Make me wanna holler, The way
they do my life.This ain't

00:12:16.367 --> 00:12:21.500
living, This ain't
living No,no baby,

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:26.600
this ain't living
No,no, no. Inflation,

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:33.800
no chance, To increase
finance. Bills pile up sky high.

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:39.800
Send that boy off to die.
Make me wanna holler.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:48.000
The way they do my life
Make me wanna holler

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:57.200
The way they do my life.

00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:59.800
Sending people to the moon?&nbsp;
Spend it on people who don't

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:03.800
have anything, please,
instead.&nbsp; People taking all

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:05.800
of our money.&nbsp; This is
exactly Gil Scott-Heron's

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:10.700
lament from the same
era.&nbsp; He closes the song,

00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:17.100
throwing up both my hands in
a lament.&nbsp; Now if you think

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:18.700
I'm stretching this
just a little bit,

00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:19.700
I mean, this is
just one album,

00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:23.600
after all, let me share with
you a personal story.&nbsp; It's

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:28.767
happening in 1971, '72,
and '73.&nbsp; I was too young to

00:13:28.767 --> 00:13:33.300
remember it, actually,
but in 1990--let me think,

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:37.100
when would this
have been--1997 or so,

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:38.900
I was living in Los
Angeles.&nbsp; My father and

00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:42.700
mother had come to
visit me and my wife,

00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:44.600
and we're driving.&nbsp; We go
out to--he'd lived in L.A.

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:48.200
for a while when--during
this era--we drive out to

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:50.500
visit some old friends
of his in Los Angeles,

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:52.800
have a great
night.&nbsp; Come back,

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:55.200
we're driving back and I
happen just to put on this

00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:58.767
album.&nbsp; I listen to it all
the time.&nbsp; He and my mother

00:13:58.767 --> 00:14:00.700
riding in the back
seat and after a while,

00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:03.700
I realize what--something
doesn't sound quite right.&nbsp;

00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:06.200
And then I realize, what I'm
hearing in the back seat is

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:10.567
weeping, I mean, flat out
weeping.&nbsp; I turn down the

00:14:10.567 --> 00:14:13.667
music, ask what's going
on, and my father just says,

00:14:13.667 --> 00:14:14.900
"I can't--you know,
I just can't talk,

00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:18.600
can't talk about it."&nbsp; Get
back to the house.&nbsp; I've

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:21.367
never seen this guy cry in
my entire life.&nbsp; I don't

00:14:21.367 --> 00:14:24.600
know what, what has actually
happened.&nbsp; I sit down with

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:25.667
him and my mother
says, "Wendell,

00:14:25.667 --> 00:14:27.267
just tell him what's
going--what happened

00:14:27.267 --> 00:14:29.800
there."&nbsp; And my
father essentially had a

00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:32.800
flashback.&nbsp; He was a
Vietnam vet himself,

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:36.667
fought--flew in the Air
Force.&nbsp; And he's saying that

00:14:36.667 --> 00:14:38.200
album just brought
everything back.&nbsp; I mean,

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:39.800
"You just don't, you
just don't understand,

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:45.400
 he tells me, "what it was
like."&nbsp; People going off and

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:47.900
trying to--risking their
lives for their country,

00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:50.500
and being treated the way
they were treated upon their

00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:52.600
return.&nbsp; And Marvin Gaye
really understood the sense

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:54.800
of confusion
that many people,

00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:56.300
not just the vets, but
certainly in his case,

00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:58.700
the vets come back trying to
figure out what is going on

00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:02.000
in this country, what do
they actually fight for?&nbsp;

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.900
Feeling a sense of moral
confusion as well.&nbsp; My

00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:07.300
father even
talked about the,

00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:10.200
you know, the economy and
the ecological landscape,

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:11.400
all in that same
moment.&nbsp; He goes,

00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:15.100
"That album really captured
it all.&nbsp; Marvin Gaye

00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:21.100
understood what was
going on."&nbsp; Now this album,

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.700
What's Going On?, fluctuates
between the international

00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:36.500
critique and also
things happening in U.S.

00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:40.000
cities, again, this
economic despair,

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.600
I keep coming back to
it.&nbsp; It's really one of the

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:46.467
defining elements of
the time.&nbsp; You also have,

00:15:46.467 --> 00:15:48.700
during this
moment, this rise of,

00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:52.600
in, in line with the
Black Panther Party,

00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:55.500
certainly, this rise of
a celebration of black

00:15:55.500 --> 00:16:01.367
masculinity, black virility,
and also black cultural

00:16:01.367 --> 00:16:03.700
celebration.&nbsp; Quite a
different one than the

00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:04.767
Harlem
Renaissance, certainly,

00:16:04.767 --> 00:16:10.300
but a black cultural
celebration all the same.&nbsp;

00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:12.100
Take these
elements together,

00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:15.467
sort of this
culturally rich moment,

00:16:15.467 --> 00:16:19.200
the notion of
abiding economic troubles,

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:23.000
and also
determination that we,

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.300
in this case the black
man--and I use that phrase

00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:28.467
quite intentionally--are
going to turn the system

00:16:28.467 --> 00:16:29.700
over.&nbsp; We're going to
be something different.

00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:34.100
You end up with an
incredibly popular movie and

00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:36.900
character.&nbsp; The character's
name is John Shaft,

00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:42.500
and the movie isShaft.&nbsp; I'll
play for you some lyrics,

00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:47.200
show you a clip, and then
explain a bit of what is

00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:49.200
actually happening
in this piece.

00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:11.467
Who's the black private dick
That's a sex machine to all

00:18:11.467 --> 00:18:12.467
the chicks?

00:18:12.467 --> 00:18:13.467
Shaft!

00:18:13.467 --> 00:18:14.467
You're damn right!

00:18:14.467 --> 00:18:17.900
Who is the man that
would risk his neck

00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:19.700
For his brother man?

00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:21.900
Shaft! Can you dig it?

00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:25.000
Who's the cat that
won't cop out

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.200
When there's
danger all about?

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:28.200
Shaft!

00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:29.200
Right on!

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:32.500
They say this cat Shaft
is a bad mother--

00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:33.500
Shut your mouth!

00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:34.700
But I'm talking about Shaft.

00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:35.700
Then we can dig it!

00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:37.367
He's a complicated man 
But no one understands him but

00:18:37.367 --> 00:18:38.367
his woman - John Shaft!

00:18:38.367 --> 00:18:39.467
Every year when I play
this, I forget to do a vocal

00:18:39.467 --> 00:18:40.467
boost, because the
lyrics--Isaac Hayes's voice

00:18:40.467 --> 00:18:41.467
is so deep, that you
lose out on the lyrics.

00:18:41.467 --> 00:18:42.467
"Who's the private--who's
the black private dick

00:18:42.467 --> 00:18:43.467
That's a sex machine to
all the chicks?&nbsp;&nbsp;(You're

00:18:43.467 --> 00:18:44.467
supposed to say "Shaft!")
[Students laugh.] You're

00:18:44.467 --> 00:18:45.467
damn right!

00:18:45.467 --> 00:18:46.467
Who is the man that
would risk his neck.

00:18:46.467 --> 00:18:47.467
For his brother man?

00:18:47.467 --> 00:18:48.467
" "Shaft!"

00:18:48.467 --> 00:18:49.467
Thank you.&nbsp; [Students
laugh] "Can you dig it?

00:18:49.467 --> 00:18:50.467
Who's the cat
that won't cop out.

00:18:50.467 --> 00:18:51.467
When there's
danger all about?"

00:18:51.467 --> 00:18:52.467
"Shaft!"

00:18:52.467 --> 00:18:53.467
"Right On!

00:18:53.467 --> 00:18:54.467
You see, this cat is--this
Shaft is a bad mother."

00:18:54.467 --> 00:18:55.467
"Shut your mouth!"

00:18:55.467 --> 00:18:56.467
"But I'm
talking about Shaft."

00:18:56.467 --> 00:18:57.467
All right, you
get it.&nbsp; Anyway,

00:18:57.467 --> 00:18:58.467
I mean it is,
it is humorous,

00:18:58.467 --> 00:18:59.467
especially when
looking like this,

00:18:59.467 --> 00:19:00.467
and being what I am,
and singing this song.&nbsp;

00:19:00.467 --> 00:19:01.467
[Students laugh]&nbsp; But,
but the song was incredibly

00:19:01.467 --> 00:19:02.467
important.&nbsp; Isaac
Hayes breaks out as well,

00:19:02.467 --> 00:19:03.467
out of the
Motown sort of trap,

00:19:03.467 --> 00:19:04.467
and comes out with this
album that electrifies

00:19:04.467 --> 00:19:05.467
people.&nbsp; He's talking about
a kind of individual they

00:19:05.467 --> 00:19:06.467
had not seen before, they
had not been around before.&nbsp;

00:19:06.467 --> 00:19:07.467
And then the movie comes
out.&nbsp; I mean this was the

00:19:07.467 --> 00:19:13.900
soundtrack to the movie.&nbsp;So
you're walking through New

00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:16.367
York, Time Square,
which used to be a complete

00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:20.700
cesspool.

00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:25.567
I'll fix it.&nbsp;Come on,
get out of the way.

00:19:25.567 --> 00:19:29.700
Want a timepiece, brother?

00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:35.700
Now I played the extended
clip here.&nbsp; There's a couple

00:19:56.867 --> 00:20:02.867
of moments that are rather
important.&nbsp; One is just the

00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:21.467
street scene that Shaft is
walking through.&nbsp; New York

00:21:21.467 --> 00:21:24.100
City, Time Square, is not
the place you've come to

00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:29.800
know with its, with its sort
of carnival atmosphere.&nbsp; It

00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:34.167
was a place of, you know,
triple-X movie theaters,

00:21:34.167 --> 00:21:38.500
prostitutes, drug use and
such.&nbsp; And John Shaft comes

00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:41.300
up, emerges in
this landscape,

00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:44.267
and walks through it, a man
on a mission.&nbsp; Thirty-four

00:21:44.267 --> 00:21:46.800
seconds into this clip,
into the start of the movie,

00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:51.067
you may have seen it or
not.&nbsp; I don't know if the

00:21:51.067 --> 00:21:52.067
lights were down
enough yet for you,

00:21:52.067 --> 00:21:54.500
but he crosses the street
and someone comes up about

00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:56.100
to hit him.&nbsp; He stops
the car and gives them the

00:21:56.100 --> 00:22:00.100
finger.&nbsp; You know, in the
grand scheme of things,

00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:02.400
especially with what we
see today in our movies,

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:04.100
in our YouTube
clips, this is,

00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:07.100
this doesn't even register.&nbsp;
This was a mind-blowing

00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:12.200
moment in American cinema,
when this movie comes out.&nbsp;

00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:15.800
A black man, walking through
a place like he owns it,

00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:18.100
giving the finger to
a white guy in a car,

00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:21.000
and he continues walking.&nbsp;
He's walking through,

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.300
his long, leather black
coat.&nbsp; Certainly reminiscent

00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:24.567
of the Panthers, but
he looks a little bit

00:22:24.567 --> 00:22:26.800
different.&nbsp; And
it turns out,

00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:29.100
when this guy tries to
sell him a hot timepiece,

00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:32.900
that he's a cop.&nbsp;
So the question is,

00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:33.900
who's the man?

00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:34.900
Shaft!

00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:39.800
Yeah, thank you!&nbsp; [Students
laugh]&nbsp; Well played,

00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:45.300
yes.&nbsp; That Shaft is
the man.&nbsp; He's virile,

00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:47.500
he's masculine.&nbsp;
As the lyrics say,

00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:52.300
"he's a complicated man."&nbsp;
And so you have a new kind

00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:55.267
of visual representation
of blackness.&nbsp; [Student

00:22:55.267 --> 00:22:58.400
sneezes] Bless you.&nbsp;
Now Shaft is one of the,

00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:05.800
the finer productions of
a, of a cultural moment in

00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:07.867
cinema called
Black--blaxploitation.&nbsp;

00:23:07.867 --> 00:23:14.900
Pardon me, I have to
multitask a little bit

00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:18.100
here.&nbsp; Blaxploitation
begins in 1971,

00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:24.100
begins, you know, all in
this moment.&nbsp; It begins with

00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:38.100
the movie, really an art
piece by a man named Melvin,

00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:42.800
Melvin Van Peebles.&nbsp;
The movie's called Sweet

00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:44.567
Sweetback's Badasssss Song.

00:23:44.567 --> 00:23:52.400
The movie is--I find it
very difficult to watch,

00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:57.200
just from the kind of
messages it's giving,

00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:59.567
and also because of
its cinematic qualities,

00:23:59.567 --> 00:24:02.600
and because it's
in some way--well,

00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:03.800
I don't care for the movie.

00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:07.900
But anyway, it's incredibly
important.&nbsp; It starts with

00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:11.400
the unnamed
narrator, or protagonist,

00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:15.867
I suppose, seen being
raised by prostitutes,

00:24:15.867 --> 00:24:19.600
he becomes a hustler.&nbsp; He
becomes witness to a moment

00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:27.000
of po--police brutality.&nbsp; He
kills a bad cop and because

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:28.600
he committed one of
the ultimate offenses,

00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:31.567
he has to go on the run.&nbsp;
And the movie is essentially

00:24:31.567 --> 00:24:33.300
him--it's a flight movie.

00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:35.300
He's going through all
these different scenes,

00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:42.267
trying to keep one step in
front of the man.&nbsp; And the

00:24:42.267 --> 00:24:43.700
man, as it turns
out in this case,

00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:47.200
is powerfully corrupt.&nbsp;
There's a lot of power;

00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:52.700
but that power has corrupted
him.&nbsp; And you see Melvin Van

00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:54.700
Peebles, he's the
lead in his own movie,

00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:57.067
you know, going through I
mean any kind of slice of

00:24:57.067 --> 00:24:59.967
life you can imagine,
representing the 1970s: drug

00:24:59.967 --> 00:25:05.100
use, sex scenes,
pimping, prostitution,

00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:07.900
crime, always trying to stay
one step in front of the

00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:12.000
man.&nbsp;And the movie becomes
an inspiration for the

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.500
formula that
becomes blaxploitation.

00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:18.000
It's a movie that
dismisses assimilation,

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:23.100
that declares the system's
corrupt.&nbsp; It is a reflection

00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:28.367
of Black Power militancy, no
matter what it's a counter

00:25:28.367 --> 00:25:33.100
to white hegemony.&nbsp; This is
how you could characterize

00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:36.000
most of the blaxploitation
films.&nbsp; There are wrinkles;

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.500
we'll get to that in a
moment.&nbsp; But I want to play

00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:44.500
for you one of the last few
clips of the movie.&nbsp; What

00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:58.900
you're seeing here, it's
a, it's a strange close up,

00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:01.300
the camera looking
down in a shallow creek,

00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:04.300
panning up to
see a, to see a,

00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:07.267
a gutted, a gutted police
dog that had come to hunt

00:26:07.267 --> 00:26:11.400
down the narrator.&nbsp; You
see it from a slightly

00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:13.000
comfortable distance.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.300
And again, it's a, it's a
movie that's about flight.

00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:21.300
It's actually hard to watch
because of the dissonance

00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:50.500
and the rough film quality.

00:26:50.500 --> 00:26:55.467
Well, the movie's shot on a
five hundred thousand dollar

00:26:55.467 --> 00:27:01.067
budget, shot in the
course of two weeks,

00:27:03.767 --> 00:27:08.300
has an all-black crew.&nbsp; So
it's giving a message about

00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:10.500
sort of a
non-assimilationist black

00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:13.300
pride and it's actually
doing it as well.&nbsp; And the

00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:18.700
movie--oh and I think it
aspires for an X rating,

00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:20.300
which had a different
connotation early seventies

00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:23.367
than it does now, because
that way they could get

00:27:23.367 --> 00:27:27.067
outside of the union system,
and then have an all-black

00:27:27.067 --> 00:27:28.700
crew.&nbsp; Shot for
five hundred grand,

00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:30.800
grosses two million--ten
million dollars,

00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:32.100
excuse me, ten
million dollars,

00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:34.767
a tremendous return on
investment.&nbsp; And this is

00:27:34.767 --> 00:27:36.667
what really launches this
five-year period of the

00:27:36.667 --> 00:27:40.600
genre.&nbsp; They are
often low budget,

00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:44.700
Shaft being really a
different creature in this

00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:46.700
regard, it's a high budget
film.&nbsp; Most of them are low

00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:51.400
budget.&nbsp; They make a ton
of money.&nbsp; The production

00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:54.067
values aren't that
wonderful.&nbsp; They're mostly

00:27:54.067 --> 00:27:57.600
action films.&nbsp; They're
very simplistic in its

00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:02.500
construction: black is good,
white is black--bad.&nbsp; They

00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:10.167
are hyper-masculine, and
they're misogynist.&nbsp;So when

00:28:10.167 --> 00:28:12.167
people think
about blaxploitation,

00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:17.600
is it about black identity,
about a certain kind of

00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:21.900
blackness?&nbsp; Is it about
cultural production?&nbsp; Or was

00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:25.300
it a co-opted capitalist
venture?&nbsp; AfterSweet

00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:27.667
Sweetback's Badasssss Song,
most of the blaxploitation

00:28:27.667 --> 00:28:33.900
film--films become studio
productions.&nbsp; No matter what

00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:35.400
you decide
blaxploitation is,

00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:38.200
it's important to think
about the images that it

00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:45.300
presents.&nbsp; They all weren't
about revolutionaries or

00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:49.200
tough upstanding men.&nbsp;
They're about different

00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:55.200
kinds of people.&nbsp; I'll play
a clip from the movie Super

00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:09.800
Fly as a way to access
this particular part of the

00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:10.800
narrative.

00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:16.900
I'm your mama,
I'm your daddy,

00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:23.500
I'm that nigga in the alley.

00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:29.500
I'm your doctor when
you need want some coke,

00:29:33.467 --> 00:29:39.467
have some weed.You
know me, I'm your friend.

00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:48.900
Your main boy,
thick and thin.

00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:55.500
I'm your pusherman,
I'm your pusherman.

00:29:55.500 --> 00:30:03.267
Ain't I clean, bad
machine super cool,

00:30:03.267 --> 00:30:05.467
super mean.

00:30:05.467 --> 00:30:10.967
Feeling good for the man.

00:30:10.967 --> 00:30:16.500
Super Fly here I stand.

00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:22.500
Secret stash, heavy bread,
baddest bitches in the bed.

00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:29.700
I'm your pusherman.

00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:33.867
I'm your pusherman.

00:30:33.867 --> 00:30:37.600
So this is a song
celebrating a pusher.&nbsp;"I'm

00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:39.500
your mama, I'm your daddy,
I'm that nigga in the alley.

00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:42.167
I'm your doctor when
you need want some coke,

00:30:42.167 --> 00:30:43.967
have some weed.

00:30:43.967 --> 00:30:45.200
You know me,
I'm your friend.

00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:48.500
Your main boy,
thick and thin."

00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:49.800
So who is the pusherman?

00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:55.800
I'll play the opening
montage from Super Fly.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:09.000
The main character is
getting out of his car.

00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:18.567
That is the main,
lead character.

00:31:18.567 --> 00:31:24.567
You with me or not?

00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:36.367
Yeah.

00:31:36.367 --> 00:31:42.367
Next mother
fucker come in here,

00:31:57.400 --> 00:32:03.400
we off him, right.

00:32:11.467 --> 00:32:17.467
You got that shit?

00:32:26.167 --> 00:32:27.600
The filmmakers
didn't need a set;

00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:31.200
they had New York
City.&nbsp; Used it as a perfect

00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:33.200
backdrop.

00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:54.500
So I played this extended
clip the same way I played

00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:56.267
Shaft.&nbsp; I mean these
movies are coming out at

00:33:56.267 --> 00:33:58.100
essentially the same time,
but they're telling quite a

00:33:58.100 --> 00:34:00.200
different story.&nbsp; Walking
through different parts of

00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:03.000
New York City, certainly.&nbsp;
Shaft walking with power and

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:04.800
authority, since
he is the man,

00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:07.800
and the pusherman doing
something really entirely

00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:10.900
quite different.&nbsp; Still,
also walking through New

00:34:10.900 --> 00:34:13.467
York City and its
economic--sights of economic

00:34:13.467 --> 00:34:16.700
devastation.&nbsp; Right
before this clip,

00:34:16.700 --> 00:34:21.600
you see the pusherman
getting out of bed.&nbsp; He has,

00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:23.567
as the lyrics in the
Curtis Mayfield song,

00:34:23.567 --> 00:34:27.300
"the baddest
bitches in the bed,

00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:28.467
 getting out of bed
with a white woman,

00:34:28.467 --> 00:34:31.000
which is of course
important for all the racial

00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:36.300
narratives about that kind
of coupling possibility,

00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:38.300
living in a very
fancy apartment,

00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:40.467
and he's really trying to
get out.&nbsp; He's made enough

00:34:40.467 --> 00:34:43.300
money, trying to get out of
the system.&nbsp; Then he's got

00:34:43.300 --> 00:34:45.400
to get these petty thieves
who are trying to take some

00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:49.367
of his, his dope.&nbsp;The story
is then about a pusherman

00:34:49.367 --> 00:34:53.367
trying to exit the high
life.&nbsp; He's going to make

00:34:53.367 --> 00:34:56.600
one final score
and retire.&nbsp; But he,

00:34:56.600 --> 00:35:00.700
as the story goes through,
he discovers that the people

00:35:00.700 --> 00:35:02.600
who are actually
the drug pins,

00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:05.800
kingpins in New York City,
the ones he has to make this

00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:08.700
final score with, are the
police.&nbsp; The commissioner of

00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:10.800
the police is the
biggest kingpin,

00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:16.300
drug kingpin in the city,
and the pusherman comes to

00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:19.400
the heroic
conclusion, by framing,

00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:23.800
or setting up, the police
commissioner.&nbsp; So you have

00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:27.767
here perhaps a hero, perhaps
an antihero.&nbsp; It's really

00:35:27.767 --> 00:35:29.200
quite unclear, but you
certainly--I mean in terms

00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:30.867
of what's being celebrated
here--but you certainly have

00:35:30.867 --> 00:35:36.500
the lingering part
of blaxploitation,

00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:39.600
that the man, when it is the
white man--not John Shaft of

00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:43.267
course--the man, usually a
person of great authority,

00:35:43.267 --> 00:35:49.000
structurally in the system,
is the cause of degradation

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:55.000
in the black community.&nbsp;Now,
I've talked about the fact

00:35:58.567 --> 00:36:05.400
that blaxploitation is
celebrating manhood of a

00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:11.400
complicated nature.&nbsp; It's
also doing something quite

00:36:13.700 --> 00:36:18.700
different.&nbsp; You know, people
often point to Pam Grier as

00:36:18.700 --> 00:36:23.000
a wonderful example of a
blaxploitation film star.&nbsp;

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:29.400
You know, she's always
winning in the end.&nbsp; One of

00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:30.467
her first movies
in this regard,

00:36:30.467 --> 00:36:37.300
Foxy Brown, is a story about
Foxy.&nbsp; Her brother is set up

00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:39.300
by drug kingpins.&nbsp; This is
one of the great narratives

00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:46.367
of blaxploitation.&nbsp; Her
boyfriend is killed by the

00:36:46.367 --> 00:36:50.567
man, and she's going to
infiltrate the mob to exact

00:36:50.567 --> 00:36:52.967
her revenge.&nbsp; And the
way she infiltrates it is

00:36:52.967 --> 00:36:54.000
becoming a prostitute.

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:56.100
In fact, at the
beginning of the movie,

00:36:56.100 --> 00:36:58.000
before this stuff
un, un, unwinds,

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:01.100
you have Pam Grier getting
out of bed with the phone

00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:04.900
ring, phone rings.&nbsp; And
within a few seconds,

00:37:04.900 --> 00:37:08.667
she's bare-chested.&nbsp; I mean
this is what blaxploitation

00:37:08.667 --> 00:37:11.867
and white--and, and female
power is suggested by Pam

00:37:11.867 --> 00:37:14.400
Grier, her sexuality
is her power.&nbsp; Anyway,

00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:17.600
I want to play the last
couple of minutes from Foxy

00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:21.200
Brown.&nbsp; It has a twist on
this narrative of who's the

00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:27.500
man, in fact, how Black
Power is interwoven in this,

00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:35.100
in interesting ways.&nbsp;What
you're seeing here is the

00:37:35.100 --> 00:37:40.867
drug kingpin's boyfriend
being stopped.&nbsp; Black

00:37:40.867 --> 00:37:48.500
mobsters have taken
over.&nbsp; Posing as the police,

00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:53.300
and now they've caught him.

00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:59.300
What are you going to do?&nbsp;
What do you want?&nbsp; What are

00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:10.800
you guys going to
do?&nbsp; What are you crazy?

00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:18.200
What do
you--He's ready, sister.

00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:26.000
No, you--You're crazy.&nbsp; You
can't do this!&nbsp; You can't do

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:27.300
that!&nbsp; No!&nbsp; No,
Foxy!&nbsp; Oh no,

00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:29.500
you can't.&nbsp; [Screams.] And
this is the drug kingpin,

00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:35.500
as it turns out, the
person behind Foxy Brown's

00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:47.100
boyfriend's
murder, her brother,

00:38:47.100 --> 00:38:49.500
her brother being
set up as well.

00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:55.500
The alarm's been tripped.

00:38:57.967 --> 00:39:03.967
Hold it right there, spook.

00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:24.900
You're going to be a spook
for real pretty soon.&nbsp; Hands

00:39:38.767 --> 00:39:43.967
up.

00:39:43.967 --> 00:39:50.900
Don't pinch the
fruit, faggot.

00:39:50.900 --> 00:39:54.567
You watch your mouth
or I'll--No Eddie,

00:39:54.567 --> 00:39:55.567
later.

00:39:55.567 --> 00:39:59.200
I want to know what
she's doing here.

00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:01.800
I'll take that thing now.

00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:05.267
Sure, I brought it
for you, Ms. Pimp.

00:40:05.267 --> 00:40:11.267
Like I said, it's a present
from your faggot boyfriend.

00:40:15.067 --> 00:40:19.967
See what it is, Eddie.

00:40:24.867 --> 00:40:27.800
[Man 2 opens the
bag]&nbsp; What is it?

00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:33.800
I don't know, it looks like
a pickle jar or something,

00:40:38.567 --> 00:40:44.400
Bring it here.&nbsp; Oh, Steve!

00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:50.400
[screams] [Foxy pulls her
gun out and shoots Man 1 and

00:40:54.200 --> 00:41:00.200
Man 2.&nbsp; Woman 1 grabs a
knife.&nbsp; Foxy shoots at

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:10.000
her.]&nbsp; Why don't you
kill me too?&nbsp; Go on,

00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:19.667
shoot, I don't
want to live anymore.

00:41:19.667 --> 00:41:25.667
I know.&nbsp; That's the idea.&nbsp;
The rest of your boyfriend

00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:35.400
is still around.&nbsp; And I hope
you two live a long time.&nbsp;

00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:47.200
And then maybe you get to
feel what I feel.&nbsp; Death is

00:41:52.900 --> 00:41:58.900
too easy for you, bitch.&nbsp;
I want you to suffer.

00:42:02.700 --> 00:42:07.600
Super bad.The
party's over, Oscar,

00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:09.567
let's go.

00:42:09.567 --> 00:42:15.800
So you have in this clip
justice being exacted along

00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:18.467
the terms that in the
black--blaxploitation

00:42:18.467 --> 00:42:23.000
vernacular made the
most sense.&nbsp; But still,

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:26.667
what kind of messages are
being offered here?&nbsp; And

00:42:26.667 --> 00:42:28.800
when you were in
the movie theater,

00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:30.867
I mean the production
value, the acting and such,

00:42:30.867 --> 00:42:33.067
you know, in the, the gun
being pulled out of the

00:42:33.067 --> 00:42:35.600
afro, these are
all humorous,

00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:38.567
but in the movie theater,
these are moments of

00:42:38.567 --> 00:42:40.400
celebration.&nbsp; This is a
whole different kind of

00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:44.100
cultural logic that
people had not seen before,

00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:49.300
not on a screen, and they
wanted to celebrate it.&nbsp;

00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:53.900
It's an era of great
struggle for the nation,

00:42:53.900 --> 00:42:58.100
truly.&nbsp; We're still not out
of that moment.&nbsp; And you'd

00:42:58.100 --> 00:43:01.000
see it articulated with its
great cultural products of

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:03.700
the age.&nbsp; It's a
moment of despair,

00:43:03.700 --> 00:43:06.400
it's despair that's
certainly likely what urged

00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:10.200
Stevie Wonder to write
some of the most socially

00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:12.300
conscious lyrics of the
era.&nbsp; And are--and these

00:43:12.300 --> 00:43:15.267
are, you won't be surprised,
these are not the ones that

00:43:15.267 --> 00:43:17.800
are heard on the radio
when people play back,

00:43:17.800 --> 00:43:20.467
you know, Stevie Wonder
reflections.&nbsp;Wonder had

00:43:20.467 --> 00:43:25.200
negotiated a new contract,
just like Marvin Gaye had

00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:28.767
done before, that broke him
out of the studio system in

00:43:28.767 --> 00:43:32.267
Motown, and re--and the
result was about a six-year

00:43:32.267 --> 00:43:34.900
cycle of albums that
was nothing short of

00:43:34.900 --> 00:43:37.867
astonishing.&nbsp; I mean,
one, that the albums are

00:43:37.867 --> 00:43:40.500
released, so many are
released in just a five-year

00:43:40.500 --> 00:43:44.267
window--actually, just a
four-year window when you

00:43:44.267 --> 00:43:50.300
think about it.&nbsp; Albums are
Music on My Mind in 1972.&nbsp;

00:43:50.300 --> 00:43:54.500
He's only 21 years old.&nbsp;
Talking Bookreleased the

00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:57.200
same year, in '72.&nbsp;
Innervisions is released in

00:43:57.200 --> 00:44:01.300
'73.&nbsp; Fulfillingness'
First Finale in '74,

00:44:01.300 --> 00:44:04.767
Songs in the Key of Life in
'76.&nbsp; This is not the Little

00:44:04.767 --> 00:44:08.400
Stevie Wonder of--he's
coming out with Motown

00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:12.267
with--I'm forgetting the
name of the song--playing

00:44:12.267 --> 00:44:15.967
his harmonica, but a Motown
sort of dance tune.&nbsp; This is

00:44:15.967 --> 00:44:18.000
not the Stevie
Wonder in later years of,

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:19.467
you know,
"Don't Drive Drunk,

00:44:19.467 --> 00:44:21.900
 thing.&nbsp; This is Stevie
Wonder of a different kind

00:44:21.900 --> 00:44:24.600
of political vintage.&nbsp; You
can hear it here in this

00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:25.600
song "Big Brother."

00:44:25.600 --> 00:44:31.600
Your name is big brother,
You say that you got me all

00:44:40.567 --> 00:44:46.567
in your notebook,
Writing it down every day,

00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:56.600
Your name is I'll see you,
(Your name is I'll see you,

00:45:05.667 --> 00:45:11.667
 I'll change if you
vote me in as the pres,

00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:24.200
President of your soul
I live in the ghetto,

00:45:29.500 --> 00:45:35.500
You just come to visit
me 'round election time.

00:45:40.767 --> 00:45:46.767
I live in the ghetto,
Someday I will move on my

00:45:54.567 --> 00:46:01.800
feet to the other side.

00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:03.667
The sound quality's much
better.&nbsp; I had the settings

00:46:03.667 --> 00:46:06.667
off on this, I apologize.&nbsp;
But in this song itself,

00:46:06.667 --> 00:46:08.600
he's going on, You know,
"I live in the ghetto,

00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:10.867
Someday I will move on my
feet to the other side,

00:46:10.867 --> 00:46:13.200
My name is secluded, we live
in a house the size of a

00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:17.800
matchbox, Roaches live
with us wall to wall" He

00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:19.400
concludes the song with,
"You've killed all our

00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:20.600
leaders.

00:46:20.600 --> 00:46:23.100
I don't even have to
do nothing to you;

00:46:23.100 --> 00:46:26.767
You'll cause your
own country to fall."

00:46:26.767 --> 00:46:28.167
This is a different
kind of Stevie Wonder,

00:46:28.167 --> 00:46:30.600
of course.

00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:36.600
Now, Wonder is using lyrics
that are call and response

00:46:39.400 --> 00:46:40.400
to Jesse Jackson.

00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:42.367
Now we've not talked about
Jesse Jackson pretty much at

00:46:42.367 --> 00:46:43.800
all in this course.&nbsp;
We'll be talking about it,

00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:47.767
I think, next week.&nbsp; But
Jackson has made a name for

00:46:47.767 --> 00:46:50.567
himself with a
famous call and response,

00:46:50.567 --> 00:46:53.100
"I am somebody."&nbsp; "I
am," and the audience says,

00:46:53.100 --> 00:46:55.667
"Somebody."&nbsp; Trying to boost
up in these rallies sort of

00:46:55.667 --> 00:46:58.200
the notion of self-esteem.&nbsp;
And Wonder's saying,

00:46:58.200 --> 00:47:01.000
"No, my name is Nobody.&nbsp;
My name is Secluded."&nbsp;

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:08.100
Incredible economic violence
and despair.&nbsp; "You have

00:47:08.100 --> 00:47:10.367
killed all of our leaders.&nbsp;
I don't have to do nothing

00:47:10.367 --> 00:47:14.200
to you to cause your own
country to fall.&nbsp; The nation

00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:17.300
is going to
collapse in upon itself.

00:47:17.300 --> 00:47:19.567
"&nbsp;So you have, then, across
in the early years of the

00:47:19.567 --> 00:47:22.300
1970s, and this lecture's
really focused on about four

00:47:22.300 --> 00:47:24.400
years, three years, three
or four years in the 1970s,

00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:29.167
a moment of incredible
cultural production,

00:47:29.167 --> 00:47:32.100
but of a type
that sends, well,

00:47:32.100 --> 00:47:34.800
a range of messages, I
suppose.&nbsp; It's talking about

00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:38.300
black virility and at a
moment of rising black

00:47:38.300 --> 00:47:40.567
feminism, which we'll be
talking about on Wednesday,

00:47:40.567 --> 00:47:42.600
sends very
interesting message,

00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:45.067
"interesting" in quotes,
interesting not in a good

00:47:45.067 --> 00:47:50.000
way, messages about the role
of the black woman.&nbsp; Still

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:54.600
wrestling with tensions
over who "the man" is,

00:47:54.600 --> 00:47:59.000
what the man looks like,
what the man does.&nbsp; Who's to

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:01.800
be blamed for the
excesses?&nbsp; In a sense,

00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:05.467
profoundly co--confusing
messages about the cultural

00:48:05.467 --> 00:48:10.200
celebration of people who
are putting drugs into the

00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:16.300
community and destroying
that community.&nbsp; As you walk

00:48:16.300 --> 00:48:18.700
out, I'll be playing
"Village Ghetto Land" from

00:48:18.700 --> 00:48:22.967
Wonder in 1976.&nbsp; He was
inviting people to come with

00:48:22.967 --> 00:48:25.567
him down to his
dead end street,

00:48:25.567 --> 00:48:29.167
to Village Ghetto Land: See
the people lock their doors,

00:48:29.167 --> 00:48:31.267
While robbers
laugh and steal,

00:48:31.267 --> 00:48:35.267
Beggars watch and eat their
meals--from garbage cans,

00:48:35.267 --> 00:48:39.200
Broken glass is everywhere,
It's a bloody scene,

00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:42.000
Killing
plays--plagues the citizens,

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:44.967
Unless they own police."

00:48:44.967 --> 00:48:46.100
Not the most
uplifting lecture,

00:48:46.100 --> 00:48:48.800
I know, but this is the
cultural moment of the early

00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:51.000
1970s.&nbsp; We'll overlap and
we'll start talking about

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:55.000
black feminism in the same
moment and see a series of

00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:57.767
conflicting messages
about blackness in the

00:48:57.767 --> 00:49:03.767
early 1970s.&nbsp; Class is over.&nbsp;

00:49:11.567 --> 00:49:16.367
Would you like to
go with me,

00:49:16.367 --> 00:49:26.200
Down my dead end street,
Would you like to come with

00:49:26.200 --> 00:49:28.200
me, To Village Ghetto Land,

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:07.345
Prof: So one way you can
think about comparisons between

00:00:07.345 --> 00:00:12.363
Marxism and the utilitarian
tradition is that both have a

00:00:12.363 --> 00:00:15.410
micro story and a macro story.
 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:19.933
So when you think about the
utilitarian tradition we have

00:00:19.933 --> 00:00:24.052
the micro story of the Pareto
principle and how each

00:00:24.052 --> 00:00:29.128
individual transaction will go,
and then we have a macro story

00:00:29.128 --> 00:00:33.393
that if you allow people to
transact freely you get the most

00:00:33.393 --> 00:00:36.430
efficient utilitarian result
over time.

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.523
And so you get the
rights-utility synthesis,

00:00:39.523 --> 00:00:41.610
at least in the aspiration.
 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.958
Another way of putting that is
what Adam Smith famously

00:00:45.958 --> 00:00:49.340
referred to as an invisible hand
theory;

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.162
that while no individual
participant is interested in

00:00:53.162 --> 00:00:56.470
generating an efficient
aggregate outcome,

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:00.174
indeed, each individual
participant is just trying to

00:01:00.174 --> 00:01:03.810
get on as high an indifference
curve as possible.

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:08.444
The byproduct of their
collective individually selfish

00:01:08.444 --> 00:01:12.379
actions is that beneficent
overall result,

00:01:12.379 --> 00:01:15.866
and so that's the invisible
hand of the market that Smith

00:01:15.866 --> 00:01:18.730
talks about in The Wealth of
Nations.

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:22.720
Marx, too, has a micro story,
a macro story,

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.691
and an invisible hand theory,
and that's what we're going to

00:01:26.691 --> 00:01:31.000
spend today's lecture and next
Monday's lecture talking about.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.819
Today, principally,
we're going to focus on his

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:37.029
micro story,
his story of how wealth gets

00:01:37.029 --> 00:01:40.790
created at the micro level under
capitalism,

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:46.800
and then we will link it on
Monday to his macro story,

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.810
and he too, you will see,
has an invisible hand theory.

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.839
That is to say the particular
players at the micro level

00:01:55.839 --> 00:01:59.430
confront incentives to behave in
certain ways,

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.950
and the byproduct of their
actions is a macro result which

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.050
nobody understands or intends.
 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.756
The difference is we'll see
that for Marx the invisible hand

00:02:12.756 --> 00:02:14.990
isn't entirely benevolent.
 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:19.104
It's benevolent for a while,
but then it start to become

00:02:19.104 --> 00:02:23.520
malevolent over time because of
the way that the dynamics of

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.139
capitalism play themselves out.
 

00:02:26.139 --> 00:02:30.020
So that's the sort of where
we're headed in the medium-term

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.229
in the next couple of lectures.
 

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:35.637
I want, though,
before heading into the micro

00:02:35.637 --> 00:02:39.199
story to make a couple of
conceptual points.

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:43.257
Remember that when we look at
Enlightenment thinkers we're

00:02:43.257 --> 00:02:47.456
concerned first and foremost
with the fact that they are all

00:02:47.456 --> 00:02:50.946
motivated by the idea of
individual freedom as the

00:02:50.946 --> 00:02:54.522
highest good,
and basing politics on

00:02:54.522 --> 00:02:59.810
scientific principles rather
than appeals to custom,

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.775
or natural law,
or religion,

00:03:01.775 --> 00:03:05.538
or tradition,
or anything else.

00:03:05.538 --> 00:03:09.657
And I just want to highlight
what Marx's assumptions about

00:03:09.657 --> 00:03:11.318
those two things are.
 

00:03:11.318 --> 00:03:15.335
I've actually mentioned these
in one way or another in last

00:03:15.335 --> 00:03:18.324
Monday's lecture,
but just to emphasize,

00:03:18.324 --> 00:03:22.194
first of all,
the idea of freedom in Marx is

00:03:22.194 --> 00:03:27.283
captured beautifully in this
very famous passage that he

00:03:27.283 --> 00:03:30.521
wrote,
actually a relatively young

00:03:30.521 --> 00:03:35.146
Marx, his critique of the
Hegelians and their followers

00:03:35.146 --> 00:03:40.030
Feuerbach in a work called
The German Ideology.

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:45.182
He has this very vivid
description of what he means by

00:03:45.182 --> 00:03:49.169
unfreedom, the antithesis of his
ideal.

00:03:49.169 --> 00:03:52.765
He says, [T]he division of
labour (which we talked about

00:03:52.765 --> 00:03:55.970
last time) offers us the first
example of how,

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:59.330
as long as man remains in
natural society,

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:02.402
that is, as long as a cleavage
exists between the particular

00:04:02.402 --> 00:04:05.201
and the common interest,
as long, therefore,

00:04:05.201 --> 00:04:08.675
as activity is not voluntarily,
but naturally,

00:04:08.675 --> 00:04:13.500
divided, man's own deed becomes
an alien power opposed to him,

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.970
which enslaves him instead of
being controlled by him.

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:20.009
For as soon as the division of
labour comes into being,

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:24.569
each man has a particular,
exclusive sphere of activity,

00:04:24.569 --> 00:04:40.589
which is forced upon him and
from which he cannot escape.

00:04:40.589 --> 00:04:42.492
He is a hunter,
a fisherman,

00:04:42.492 --> 00:04:46.507
a herdsman, or a critical
critic, and must remain so if he

00:04:46.507 --> 00:04:50.029
does not want to lose his means
of livelihood;

00:04:50.029 --> 00:04:54.170
while in communist society
(this is his utopian ideal),

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:58.857
where nobody has one exclusive
sphere of activity but each can

00:04:58.857 --> 00:05:02.470
become accomplished in any
branch he wishes,

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:06.060
society regulates the general
production and thus makes it

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:10.026
possible for me to do one thing
today and another tomorrow (this

00:05:10.026 --> 00:05:13.240
is maybe the most famous line in
all of Marx),

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.449
to hunt in the morning,
fish in the afternoon,

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:20.199
rear cattle in the evening,
criticise after dinner,

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:23.800
just as I have a mind,
without ever becoming hunter,

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:27.860
fisherman, herdsman or critic.
 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:32.826
So this is a utopian Marx,
this idea that as soon as you

00:05:32.826 --> 00:05:37.160
have a division of labor we're
no longer free.

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:41.101
We're enslaved to our
particular place in the division

00:05:41.101 --> 00:05:41.920
of labor.
 

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:46.134
Remember what I read to you
from Adam Smith's description of

00:05:46.134 --> 00:05:47.420
the pin factory?
 

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:51.891
Somebody spends their whole
life stretching that wire for

00:05:51.891 --> 00:05:52.690
the pin.
 

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:56.077
Somebody spends their whole
life putting the heads on the

00:05:56.077 --> 00:05:56.440
pin.
 

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:00.127
That's the sense in which Marx
wants to say we're alienated

00:06:00.127 --> 00:06:03.879
from our true selves once the
division of labor sets in,

00:06:03.879 --> 00:06:09.391
and we can only return to being
fully rounded human beings at

00:06:09.391 --> 00:06:14.721
one with ourselves when the
division of labor ultimately is

00:06:14.721 --> 00:06:19.101
abolished,
and a precondition for that is

00:06:19.101 --> 00:06:25.108
the super abundance of wealth
that capitalism is historically

00:06:25.108 --> 00:06:27.310
destined to create.
 

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:32.742
And how we will finally get
there is the story Marx believed

00:06:32.742 --> 00:06:37.440
of how his macro theory would
play out over time.

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:41.848
And we will only reach a
communist society where people

00:06:41.848 --> 00:06:46.911
can be genuinely free once the
need for a division of labor has

00:06:46.911 --> 00:06:52.300
been obviated by the existence
of a super abundance of wealth.

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:56.589
So all of that's coming,
but this is just to underscore

00:06:56.589 --> 00:07:00.720
that his basic ideal is freedom
and not equality,

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:05.278
and his argument is going to
be, as I said to you last time,

00:07:05.278 --> 00:07:10.867
that the condition for the free
development of each is the free

00:07:10.867 --> 00:07:12.759
development of all.
 

00:07:12.759 --> 00:07:18.420
Second, just to come back to
his and underscore his theory of

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:21.629
science, Marx is an objectivist.
 

00:07:21.629 --> 00:07:27.380
He believes that there are
forces operating in history,

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:32.918
which he calls the materialist
conception of history,

00:07:32.918 --> 00:07:37.180
which shape the way history
unfolds.

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:38.720
History has a direction.
 

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:42.759
It's moving through a variety
of phases,

00:07:42.759 --> 00:07:46.579
each of which has internal
contradictions,

00:07:46.579 --> 00:07:50.920
and the way they play
themselves out is going to

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:53.230
determine what happens.
 

00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:58.913
So the tension in a feudal
society between the peasants and

00:07:58.913 --> 00:08:04.697
the lords is going to determine
the way in which conflict in

00:08:04.697 --> 00:08:07.050
that society occurs.
 

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:10.119
Then you'll get the emergence
of a bourgeoisie class and they

00:08:10.119 --> 00:08:13.153
will create capitalism,
but that will bring forth a

00:08:13.153 --> 00:08:16.560
working class who will get into
conflicts with them,

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:20.685
and as those conflicts play out
you'll eventually get communism

00:08:20.685 --> 00:08:21.750
and socialism.
 

00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:23.939
It's a reductionist theory.
 

00:08:23.939 --> 00:08:27.920
As I said to you before,
think of Bill Clinton's line,

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:30.850
"It's the economy,
stupid."

00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:34.283
Most of what happens,
if not all of what happens,

00:08:34.283 --> 00:08:38.004
that's of any importance in
politics is determined by

00:08:38.004 --> 00:08:39.649
economic interests.
 

00:08:39.649 --> 00:08:44.052
Whether people understand this
or not, or agree with it or not

00:08:44.052 --> 00:08:45.639
is beside the point.
 

00:08:45.639 --> 00:08:51.428
And that brings us to a third
element of this Marxian science

00:08:51.428 --> 00:08:56.428
that I just want to underscore,
which will be relevant for

00:08:56.428 --> 00:08:59.333
today's lecture,
is that Marx makes a

00:08:59.333 --> 00:09:02.934
distinction between a
class-in-itself and a

00:09:02.934 --> 00:09:04.649
class-for-itself.
 

00:09:04.649 --> 00:09:07.649
I want to spend a couple of
minutes on, first,

00:09:07.649 --> 00:09:11.250
his definition of class,
and then this "in-itself/

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:13.450
for-itself"
distinction.

00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:19.940
A lot of people say that Marx
is anti-individual.

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:23.808
He's not individualist because
he thinks about things in terms

00:09:23.808 --> 00:09:25.840
of classes and class conflict.
 

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:30.158
That is a very superficial
reading of Marx.

00:09:30.158 --> 00:09:34.783
As a very eminent scholar
called Jon Elster has pointed

00:09:34.783 --> 00:09:39.408
out in many books that he's
written on the subject,

00:09:39.408 --> 00:09:43.806
actually Marx is an
individualist because if you

00:09:43.806 --> 00:09:49.511
look at how he defines classes
he defines them by reference to

00:09:49.511 --> 00:09:54.188
the way in which individuals
relate to the means of

00:09:54.188 --> 00:09:55.779
production.
 

00:09:55.779 --> 00:09:58.965
So what is it that makes you
working class as opposed to a

00:09:58.965 --> 00:10:00.808
member of the capitalist class?
 

00:10:00.808 --> 00:10:04.568
What makes you working class is
if you have to sell your

00:10:04.568 --> 00:10:07.850
labor-power to somebody else in
order to live.

00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:11.407
So if you want to know whether
somebody is working class you

00:10:11.407 --> 00:10:14.003
say,
"Does he have to sell his

00:10:14.003 --> 00:10:18.350
labor-power to somebody else in
order to live or not?"

00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:20.778
If the answer's yes,
he's working class.

00:10:20.778 --> 00:10:25.320
If the answer's no,
he's not working class.

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:29.224
So you might say,
"Hmm, well,

00:10:29.224 --> 00:10:36.558
I have to come here and work
everyday to get paid my salary.

00:10:36.558 --> 00:10:41.423
I have to sell my labor to the
university in that sense,

00:10:41.423 --> 00:10:43.899
but I'm not working class.
 

00:10:43.899 --> 00:10:46.615
Somebody else might tell me I'm
working class,

00:10:46.615 --> 00:10:48.789
but they can speak for
themselves.

00:10:48.789 --> 00:10:51.230
I drive a nice car.
 

00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:52.190
I live in the suburbs.
 

00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:55.190
I'm not working class."
 

00:10:55.190 --> 00:11:00.489
Marx's answer is to appeal to
this distinction between a

00:11:00.489 --> 00:11:04.440
class-in-itself and a
class-for-itself.

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:06.404
The answer is,
"Shapiro,

00:11:06.404 --> 00:11:07.950
you're just deluded.
 

00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:10.544
You might think you're not
working class,

00:11:10.544 --> 00:11:13.984
but that's because you don't
understand your objective

00:11:13.984 --> 00:11:16.450
position in the division of
labor.

00:11:16.450 --> 00:11:20.928
You are working class whether
you understand it or not.

00:11:20.928 --> 00:11:25.851
And that a class I'm a working
class in the class-in-itself

00:11:25.851 --> 00:11:26.528
sense.
 

00:11:26.528 --> 00:11:30.572
I'm not working class in the
class-for-itself if I don't

00:11:30.572 --> 00:11:33.000
believe that I'm working class.
 

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.950
So the "in-itself"
represents the objective

00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:41.769
definition of class,
the "for-itself"

00:11:41.769 --> 00:11:45.158
is the subjective;
whether people actually believe

00:11:45.158 --> 00:11:48.703
they're working class and
perceive themselves to be

00:11:48.703 --> 00:11:49.908
working class.
 

00:11:49.908 --> 00:11:53.666
But what matters for the
movement of history is the

00:11:53.666 --> 00:11:55.470
"in-itself."
 

00:11:55.470 --> 00:12:00.357
What's ultimately going to
drive everything is the

00:12:00.357 --> 00:12:04.048
objective logic of class
conflict,

00:12:04.048 --> 00:12:07.770
not the subjective logic of
what people think is their

00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:10.788
position in the social division
of labor.

00:12:10.788 --> 00:12:16.058
So it's important to keep those
two things separate.

00:12:16.058 --> 00:12:18.370
Now, Marx, as I've I already
said,

00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:22.556
was a utopian thinker,
and he does ultimately want to

00:12:22.556 --> 00:12:25.514
say,
for reasons that I'll get into

00:12:25.514 --> 00:12:28.870
later today and in more depth on
Monday,

00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:33.168
he does ultimately want to say
that what differentiates a

00:12:33.168 --> 00:12:37.542
communist revolution from all
previous revolutions is that

00:12:37.542 --> 00:12:40.918
these two things will become
synonymous;

00:12:40.918 --> 00:12:45.226
that for the first time in
history the working

00:12:45.226 --> 00:12:50.394
class-for-itself will come to
see itself as the working

00:12:50.394 --> 00:12:52.308
class-in-itself.
 

00:12:52.308 --> 00:12:55.928
We will understand our
objective position in the

00:12:55.928 --> 00:12:59.932
division of labor and
self-consciously create the new

00:12:59.932 --> 00:13:02.660
order,
whereas in all previous modes

00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:05.841
of production,
people don't really understand

00:13:05.841 --> 00:13:10.057
their position in the objective
scheme of things and so they

00:13:10.057 --> 00:13:12.700
create orders as invisible
hands,

00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:14.860
to go back to Adam Smith's term.
 

00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:19.105
They create orders as
byproducts of their intended

00:13:19.105 --> 00:13:24.129
activities, not as products of
their intentional design.

00:13:24.129 --> 00:13:27.722
And so that's that distinction
between "in-itself"

00:13:27.722 --> 00:13:29.490
and "for-itself."
 

00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:32.230
Now, you might listen to all of
this and you could say,

00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:38.330
"Well, it's a kind of
quaint nineteenth-century idea,

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:42.984
but it doesn't have much to do
with the way people live in the

00:13:42.984 --> 00:13:44.509
world today."
 

00:13:44.509 --> 00:13:48.745
After all, as we have all
noticed with great intensity in

00:13:48.745 --> 00:13:52.678
the past year and a half of the
financial crisis,

00:13:52.678 --> 00:13:59.197
many people who work for wages
also have money in the stock

00:13:59.197 --> 00:14:00.210
market.
 

00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:04.534
Well, but then they're
capitalists, aren't they,

00:14:04.534 --> 00:14:07.019
because stock is capital?
 

00:14:07.019 --> 00:14:10.761
So I have my retirement money
in my TIAA-CREF,

00:14:10.761 --> 00:14:14.837
as college professors get it,
in the stock market,

00:14:14.837 --> 00:14:19.080
so I'm an owner of capital as
well as a worker.

00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:23.638
And this sort of binary
distinction between the working

00:14:23.638 --> 00:14:28.620
class and the capitalist class
is just too simple-minded.

00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:33.269
What do you think Marx would
say to that?

00:14:33.269 --> 00:14:36.190
Anybody?
 

00:14:36.190 --> 00:14:39.009
Any takers?
 

00:14:39.009 --> 00:14:43.865
I'm not really working class
because I've got money,

00:14:43.865 --> 00:14:48.529
and I have stocks invested in
all kinds of things,

00:14:48.529 --> 00:14:52.147
mutual funds,
so I'm not really working

00:14:52.147 --> 00:14:53.288
class.
 

00:14:53.288 --> 00:14:57.710
Anyone think what Marx might
say to that?

00:14:57.710 --> 00:15:01.649
It's not easy.
 

00:15:01.649 --> 00:15:03.418
I think that what he would say
is this.

00:15:03.418 --> 00:15:06.267
He would say,
"Well, the definition of

00:15:06.267 --> 00:15:10.198
working class is that you have
to work for somebody else in

00:15:10.198 --> 00:15:11.418
order to live.
 

00:15:11.418 --> 00:15:15.379
Not that you choose to work for
somebody else in order to live.

00:15:15.379 --> 00:15:19.988
So if I have enough money in my
TIAA-CREF invested in the stock

00:15:19.988 --> 00:15:23.554
market that I can quit tomorrow
and do just fine,

00:15:23.554 --> 00:15:25.860
then I'm not working class.
 

00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:29.370
So it's this element of
compulsion that makes you

00:15:29.370 --> 00:15:30.538
working class.
 

00:15:30.538 --> 00:15:36.384
So it's not important from
Marx's point of view that some

00:15:36.384 --> 00:15:41.023
of us might own stocks,
but if we really owned enough

00:15:41.023 --> 00:15:45.004
stock that we were not in this
position of having to work for

00:15:45.004 --> 00:15:49.250
somebody else in order to live
we wouldn't be working class,

00:15:49.250 --> 00:15:52.889
and so people could move in and
out of the working class.

00:15:52.889 --> 00:15:57.274
Indeed, I know people on the
Yale faculty who two years ago

00:15:57.274 --> 00:16:02.190
were about to retire and live
off their accumulated TIAA-CREF,

00:16:02.190 --> 00:16:05.667
and then it went up in smoke
when the wheels came off the

00:16:05.667 --> 00:16:08.490
economy,
and now they're not retiring.

00:16:08.490 --> 00:16:10.389
So what Marx would say is,
"Well,

00:16:10.389 --> 00:16:13.480
the managed to get out of the
working class in theory,

00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:15.648
in principle,
but then they fell back down

00:16:15.648 --> 00:16:16.970
into the working class.
 

00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:20.580
So it's this element of
compulsion.

00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:23.618
They're not retiring because
they don't have enough,

00:16:23.618 --> 00:16:27.192
and therefore they have to work
for somebody else in order to

00:16:27.192 --> 00:16:27.730
live.
 

00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:33.181
So that's the distinction
between a class-in-itself and a

00:16:33.181 --> 00:16:37.269
class-for-itself that drives his
theory.

00:16:37.269 --> 00:16:40.309
Okay, so what is the theory?
 

00:16:40.309 --> 00:16:45.299
 
 

00:16:45.299 --> 00:16:47.610
We're back to Locke.
 

00:16:47.610 --> 00:16:50.655
Those of you who read chapter
five of The Second

00:16:50.655 --> 00:16:54.990
Treatise carefully,
when we looked at Locke and his

00:16:54.990 --> 00:17:00.047
theory of property saw how for
Locke the workmanship ideal

00:17:00.047 --> 00:17:05.459
plays out in the economic realm
with the proposition that most

00:17:05.459 --> 00:17:09.630
of the value of a product comes
from work.

00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:12.355
Very crude in Locke;
at one point he says,

00:17:12.355 --> 00:17:15.490
"Ninety percent of it
comes from work.

00:17:15.490 --> 00:17:17.358
The rest is natural
resources."

00:17:17.358 --> 00:17:20.423
At another point he says,
"Ninety-nine percent of it

00:17:20.423 --> 00:17:21.410
comes from work.
 

00:17:21.410 --> 00:17:23.900
The rest is natural
resources."

00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:29.144
But Locke doesn't really have
any mechanism by which labor

00:17:29.144 --> 00:17:31.630
supposedly creates value.
 

00:17:31.630 --> 00:17:34.471
And in the seventeenth and
eighteenth century there were

00:17:34.471 --> 00:17:36.538
really three theories floating
around.

00:17:36.538 --> 00:17:39.920
There were, as I think I
mentioned to you on Monday,

00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:43.118
there were in Europe,
particularly France,

00:17:43.118 --> 00:17:46.730
the physiocrats who said value
comes from the land,

00:17:46.730 --> 00:17:49.638
but there were English
theorists who looked at them and

00:17:49.638 --> 00:17:50.561
said,
"No.

00:17:50.561 --> 00:17:53.571
That can't be right because
look how rich Holland is and

00:17:53.571 --> 00:17:56.582
they don't have a lot of
land," and so they thought

00:17:56.582 --> 00:17:58.058
value came from trade.
 

00:17:58.058 --> 00:18:01.317
But then the third group,
starting in the seventeenth

00:18:01.317 --> 00:18:03.990
century with Hobbes,
Sir William Petty,

00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:08.558
Locke and others said,
"No, value comes from work.

00:18:08.558 --> 00:18:14.065
The source of value is
work," and that's what Marx

00:18:14.065 --> 00:18:19.470
picks up on in trying to develop
a theory of value.

00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:23.855
And his theory is more refined
than Locke's,

00:18:23.855 --> 00:18:28.651
more refined than Smith's,
and more refined than

00:18:28.651 --> 00:18:30.078
Ricardo's.
 

00:18:30.078 --> 00:18:35.359
It starts with this idea of
socially necessary labor time,

00:18:35.359 --> 00:18:40.641
or SNLT, and he defines SNLT as
the labor time required to

00:18:40.641 --> 00:18:43.048
produce any use-value.
 

00:18:43.048 --> 00:18:50.088
Anyone remind us what is a
use-value?

00:18:50.088 --> 00:18:55.509
Monday's lecture,
what's a...

00:18:55.509 --> 00:18:56.284
Yes?
 

00:18:56.284 --> 00:18:57.640
Yes?
 

00:18:57.640 --> 00:18:58.759
Student:  Is it useful?
 

00:18:58.759 --> 00:19:00.023
Prof: Right.
 

00:19:00.023 --> 00:19:03.220
So anything with utility is a
use-value, right?

00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:07.612
So it's the amount of labor
time required to produce any use

00:19:07.612 --> 00:19:11.930
value under the conditions of
production normal for a given

00:19:11.930 --> 00:19:16.396
society and with the average
degree of skill and intensity of

00:19:16.396 --> 00:19:19.450
the labor prevalent in the
society.

00:19:19.450 --> 00:19:27.858
So let's suppose Leonid and I
are making typewriters.

00:19:27.858 --> 00:19:32.755
One of the big sort of
conundrums of labor theories of

00:19:32.755 --> 00:19:36.878
value have been,
well, what if Leonid is a

00:19:36.878 --> 00:19:41.713
perfectionist and he spends
twice as long making his

00:19:41.713 --> 00:19:46.170
typewriter as I spend making my
typewriter,

00:19:46.170 --> 00:19:51.007
but most of the perfectionism
is actually in his own head

00:19:51.007 --> 00:19:55.240
because at the end of the day
they're the same?

00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:59.449
Marx would say--he would not
say Leonid's typewriter was

00:19:59.449 --> 00:20:04.041
worth twice Shapiro's typewriter
because he put twice as much

00:20:04.041 --> 00:20:05.420
labor into it.
 

00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:11.608
No, because half of his labor
would be socially unnecessary.

00:20:11.608 --> 00:20:15.940
So it's socially necessary
labor time.

00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:20.730
Or if a new labor saving device
was created so that the keys

00:20:20.730 --> 00:20:25.846
could be made much more quickly
than our laborious doing it with

00:20:25.846 --> 00:20:28.440
file,
and I use the new machine,

00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:31.617
the labor saving device,
and Leonid doesn't,

00:20:31.617 --> 00:20:34.930
so my typewriters get produced
more quickly.

00:20:34.930 --> 00:20:40.016
His typewriter is not going to
sell for more than my typewriter

00:20:40.016 --> 00:20:43.788
because, again,
he's using socially unnecessary

00:20:43.788 --> 00:20:44.608
labor.
 

00:20:44.608 --> 00:20:47.509
So that's the notion of
"the average degree of

00:20:47.509 --> 00:20:50.930
skill and intensity of labor
prevalent in the society at the

00:20:50.930 --> 00:20:51.798
time."
 

00:20:51.798 --> 00:20:56.627
So that's what's going to
determine the value of

00:20:56.627 --> 00:21:00.253
commodities,
the long-term--remember we

00:21:00.253 --> 00:21:05.740
talked about the natural value,
the long-term equilibrium price

00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:09.471
of a commodity,
is going to be determined by

00:21:09.471 --> 00:21:14.284
the amount of labor power that
is socially necessary to produce

00:21:14.284 --> 00:21:14.750
it.
 

00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:17.846
And this idea of "socially
necessary"

00:21:17.846 --> 00:21:21.279
includes everybody working at
the same or an average

00:21:21.279 --> 00:21:24.262
intensity,
and it includes using available

00:21:24.262 --> 00:21:26.808
technologies because if some use
them,

00:21:26.808 --> 00:21:30.852
and others don't,
those who don't are going to be

00:21:30.852 --> 00:21:35.738
deploying unnecessary labor time
and that's not going to be

00:21:35.738 --> 00:21:40.875
reflected in the value of the
product because in a competitive

00:21:40.875 --> 00:21:45.929
market the most cheaply priced
commodity is going to beat the

00:21:45.929 --> 00:21:47.529
others out.
 

00:21:47.529 --> 00:21:50.635
Important to remember,
Marx works with a model of a

00:21:50.635 --> 00:21:54.178
perfectly competitive economy,
right, in which equivalents

00:21:54.178 --> 00:21:55.980
exchange for equivalents.
 

00:21:55.980 --> 00:22:00.150
No cheating;
I mentioned that on Monday.

00:22:00.150 --> 00:22:02.770
His model is a perfectly
competitive economy,

00:22:02.770 --> 00:22:04.440
at least at the beginning.
 

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:08.105
He's got a view about how
economies evolve over time to

00:22:08.105 --> 00:22:11.230
become uncompetitive,
and we'll get to that.

00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:14.028
But initially,
and in his analytic story,

00:22:14.028 --> 00:22:17.662
in a competitive economy the
most cheaply produced products

00:22:17.662 --> 00:22:20.920
are going to drive out the less
cheaply produced,

00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:24.430
and so it's socially necessary
labor time,

00:22:24.430 --> 00:22:27.130
not actual.
 

00:22:27.130 --> 00:22:31.683
It doesn't matter how much
blood, sweat and tears Leonid

00:22:31.683 --> 00:22:33.009
actually uses.
 

00:22:33.009 --> 00:22:36.561
What counts is how much he
needs to use,

00:22:36.561 --> 00:22:37.200
okay?
 

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:39.308
So that--you could say,
"Okay,

00:22:39.308 --> 00:22:44.183
but that's not the beginning of
the whole story,"

00:22:44.183 --> 00:22:49.884
and to get into that we have to
go a step further with Marx and

00:22:49.884 --> 00:22:54.298
look not just at the labor
theory of value,

00:22:54.298 --> 00:22:58.279
but the labor theory of surplus
value.

00:22:58.279 --> 00:23:01.490
This is where the rubber meets
the road for Marx.

00:23:01.490 --> 00:23:07.566
What he wants to say is,
"Living human labor-power

00:23:07.566 --> 00:23:14.430
is the only source of fresh
value, of exchange value."

00:23:14.430 --> 00:23:19.016
So this is the workmanship
ideal on crack,

00:23:19.016 --> 00:23:19.798
okay?
 

00:23:19.798 --> 00:23:27.690
Living human labor-power is the
only source of fresh value.

00:23:27.690 --> 00:23:31.618
So when Locke said,
"Work is ninety percent,

00:23:31.618 --> 00:23:34.818
or maybe it's ninety-nine
percent of the value of

00:23:34.818 --> 00:23:38.286
commodities and the rest comes
from the common,"

00:23:38.286 --> 00:23:41.480
Marx is going to say,
"It's a hundred percent.

00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:46.480
All exchange value comes from
work."

00:23:46.480 --> 00:24:00.048
And what he's thinking of here
is two things.

00:24:00.048 --> 00:24:03.714
One is he wants to say,
"If you look at all the

00:24:03.714 --> 00:24:08.172
commodities that are produced in
a market economy the one thing

00:24:08.172 --> 00:24:12.198
they all have in common is that
they're products of human

00:24:12.198 --> 00:24:13.420
work."
 

00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:25.619
It's the single common
denominator, right?

00:24:25.619 --> 00:24:29.390
 
 

00:24:29.390 --> 00:24:36.946
The capacity to work is a
commodity like any other so

00:24:36.946 --> 00:24:40.195
that,
we'll get into this in more

00:24:40.195 --> 00:24:43.900
detail in a minute,
but when you think about what

00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:48.807
it is that people are paid,
what is it that a worker is

00:24:48.807 --> 00:24:55.200
paid, it's determined like the
value of any other commodity.

00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:58.210
So when we say,
"What is the value of a

00:24:58.210 --> 00:24:59.118
book?"
 

00:24:59.118 --> 00:25:03.460
It's determined by the amount
of labor power necessary to

00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:05.009
produce that book.
 

00:25:05.009 --> 00:25:07.413
And when we say,
"What is the value of a

00:25:07.413 --> 00:25:08.558
steel worker?"
 

00:25:08.558 --> 00:25:11.960
It's determined by the amount
of labor power necessary to

00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:13.660
produce that steel worker.
 

00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:17.952
The worker is a commodity in
just the same sense as the book

00:25:17.952 --> 00:25:19.190
is a commodity.
 

00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:25.410
So wages are determined by the
cost of producing the worker,

00:25:25.410 --> 00:25:31.945
and the reason a physicist gets
paid more than a manual laborer

00:25:31.945 --> 00:25:33.950
then is simple.
 

00:25:33.950 --> 00:25:37.462
It costs more to produce the
physicist than it costs to

00:25:37.462 --> 00:25:39.348
produce the manual laborer.
 

00:25:39.348 --> 00:25:41.365
All the training,
and education,

00:25:41.365 --> 00:25:44.070
and so on,
that goes into the physicist

00:25:44.070 --> 00:25:47.795
costs more than the training and
education that goes into

00:25:47.795 --> 00:25:49.788
producing a manual laborer.
 

00:25:49.788 --> 00:25:54.115
So wages are not explained by
the value of what the worker

00:25:54.115 --> 00:25:54.950
produces.
 

00:25:54.950 --> 00:25:57.558
This is one of the things
people often get wrong.

00:25:57.558 --> 00:26:03.509
Values are explained by the
cost of producing the worker.

00:26:03.509 --> 00:26:04.432
I'll say that again.
 

00:26:04.432 --> 00:26:05.170
It's important.
 

00:26:05.170 --> 00:26:11.744
Wages are explained not by the
value of what the worker

00:26:11.744 --> 00:26:18.930
produces, but rather by the cost
of producing the worker.

00:26:18.930 --> 00:26:21.859
So what do you think of that?
 

00:26:21.859 --> 00:26:28.368
What would somebody say?
 

00:26:28.368 --> 00:26:32.930
Somebody who thought this
was--what would Marx say about,

00:26:32.930 --> 00:26:37.598
"Why is a Michelangelo
painting worth so much,

00:26:37.598 --> 00:26:44.790
or why does a professional
baseball player get tens of

00:26:44.790 --> 00:26:49.376
millions,
maybe hundreds of millions of

00:26:49.376 --> 00:26:52.538
dollars if this is true?"
 

00:26:52.538 --> 00:26:55.490
Anyone think of what Marx would
say?

00:26:55.490 --> 00:27:00.720
 
 

00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:06.039
Anyone want to guess?
 

00:27:06.039 --> 00:27:07.720
Yeah?
 

00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:11.444
Student:  Would he say
it's because like how much time

00:27:11.444 --> 00:27:14.425
they had to practice,
and how much money and time

00:27:14.425 --> 00:27:16.910
they put into learning their
skills?

00:27:16.910 --> 00:27:19.682
Prof: That would be part
of it, but still there are only

00:27:19.682 --> 00:27:20.798
so many hours in a day.
 

00:27:20.798 --> 00:27:29.348
How do you get up to a hundred
million dollar salary?

00:27:29.348 --> 00:27:33.230
I mean, you're on the right
track.

00:27:33.230 --> 00:27:37.185
What else goes into the
creation of a major league

00:27:37.185 --> 00:27:38.640
baseball player?
 

00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:44.713
Why don't they have very good
major league baseball players in

00:27:44.713 --> 00:27:45.710
Britain?
 

00:27:45.710 --> 00:27:47.380
Because they don't have minor
leagues,

00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:50.951
they don't have farm teams,
there's this huge cost

00:27:50.951 --> 00:27:55.105
associated with getting the one
brilliant best of all time

00:27:55.105 --> 00:27:58.132
player,
so that's what he would have to

00:27:58.132 --> 00:27:58.480
say.
 

00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:02.595
Or if you think about the value
of a Michelangelo painting it's

00:28:02.595 --> 00:28:05.250
not just the training of
Michelangelo.

00:28:05.250 --> 00:28:09.590
It's all those failed painters
that all those pubs wasted all

00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:11.980
that money investing in,
right?

00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:18.153
That all goes in,
in some indirect sense,

00:28:18.153 --> 00:28:22.630
into the wage differential.
 

00:28:22.630 --> 00:28:26.588
So that's sort of what--of
course it is a stretch,

00:28:26.588 --> 00:28:33.807
and one thing that Marx did not
think about was what we call in

00:28:33.807 --> 00:28:38.618
economics today,
winner-take-all markets.

00:28:38.618 --> 00:28:42.000
Anyone know what a
winner-take-all market is?

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:46.059
What's a winner take all market?
 

00:28:46.059 --> 00:28:52.319
 
 

00:28:52.319 --> 00:28:54.680
What is the phrase suggesting?
 

00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:57.549
What do you think a winner take
all market could be?

00:28:57.549 --> 00:29:06.190
 
 

00:29:06.190 --> 00:29:09.079
Think about the wage
differential between the major

00:29:09.079 --> 00:29:11.220
leagues and minor leagues
baseball.

00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:12.490
It's huge, right?
 

00:29:12.490 --> 00:29:16.058
That's a winner-take-all market.
 

00:29:16.058 --> 00:29:23.433
The way you can think about it
is, before the advent of the

00:29:23.433 --> 00:29:29.028
gramophone record,
being a really pretty good

00:29:29.028 --> 00:29:34.750
opera singer could--you'd do
pretty well.

00:29:34.750 --> 00:29:38.010
Every major city would have an
opera with a pretty good opera

00:29:38.010 --> 00:29:39.858
singer who'd make a good living.
 

00:29:39.858 --> 00:29:44.390
Once you have the gramophone
record then everybody can buy

00:29:44.390 --> 00:29:45.900
Pavarotti, right?
 

00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:50.509
So then whether or not the
difference between Pavarotti,

00:29:50.509 --> 00:29:54.616
and the next best,
and the third best opera singer

00:29:54.616 --> 00:29:57.298
becomes much more important.
 

00:29:57.298 --> 00:30:00.540
So that's the idea of a
winner-take-all market,

00:30:00.540 --> 00:30:03.430
and Marx had nothing to say
about them.

00:30:03.430 --> 00:30:06.978
So he would have to reach for
this rather contorted logic of

00:30:06.978 --> 00:30:10.272
saying,
"It just costs much more

00:30:10.272 --> 00:30:15.753
to produce the best baseball
player in the world because you

00:30:15.753 --> 00:30:21.048
have to run everything that goes
into that production;

00:30:21.048 --> 00:30:24.294
not only his own practicing and
training, but everything that

00:30:24.294 --> 00:30:25.430
goes with it."
 

00:30:25.430 --> 00:30:26.778
So that's the first point.
 

00:30:26.778 --> 00:30:31.473
Labor power is a commodity and
its exchange value or its price

00:30:31.473 --> 00:30:34.859
is determined what it costs to
produce it.

00:30:34.859 --> 00:30:38.210
But then this is the magic.
 

00:30:38.210 --> 00:30:41.849
This is the workmanship ideal
on crack.

00:30:41.849 --> 00:30:42.910
This is the idea.
 

00:30:42.910 --> 00:30:48.114
He wants to say that living
human labor power is a unique

00:30:48.114 --> 00:30:53.039
commodity in that its
consumption as a use-value leads

00:30:53.039 --> 00:30:57.130
to the creation of fresh
exchange value.

00:30:57.130 --> 00:30:58.740
What does this mean?
 

00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:05.973
It means that suppose I have
some money and I spend a

00:31:05.973 --> 00:31:12.930
thousand dollars on a wonderful
meal, good wine?

00:31:12.930 --> 00:31:15.980
 
 

00:31:15.980 --> 00:31:20.859
At the end of that meal it's
gone, right?

00:31:20.859 --> 00:31:23.839
I pay the check and it's gone.
 

00:31:23.839 --> 00:31:26.940
I've consumed it.
 

00:31:26.940 --> 00:31:32.880
Whereas, if I had spent that
thousand dollars hiring one of

00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:39.230
you to paint one wall in my home
when it's done my home's worth

00:31:39.230 --> 00:31:45.069
something more because it has a
freshly painted wall.

00:31:45.069 --> 00:31:48.160
That's what he means, okay?
 

00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:51.557
So that living human
labor-power differs from other

00:31:51.557 --> 00:31:55.294
commodities in that its
consumption as a use-value leads

00:31:55.294 --> 00:31:57.943
to the creation of fresh
exchange value,

00:31:57.943 --> 00:31:58.759
right?
 

00:31:58.759 --> 00:32:01.633
You eat the meal,
it's gone, but you consume the

00:32:01.633 --> 00:32:04.630
labor-power of the person
painting your house,

00:32:04.630 --> 00:32:09.701
or the person working in your
factory and it's not gone,

00:32:09.701 --> 00:32:10.440
right?
 

00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:15.384
I mean, the labor-power's gone
in the sense that it's been

00:32:15.384 --> 00:32:16.338
expended.
 

00:32:16.338 --> 00:32:19.738
Those calories have been spent,
but you have something of

00:32:19.738 --> 00:32:20.710
greater value.
 

00:32:20.710 --> 00:32:24.788
You have a house that's worth
more than it was before you

00:32:24.788 --> 00:32:28.503
hired that person to paint it,
and that's what makes

00:32:28.503 --> 00:32:30.690
labor-power unique,
right?

00:32:30.690 --> 00:32:40.542
He wants to say it is the only
source of fresh value,

00:32:40.542 --> 00:32:41.868
okay?
 

00:32:41.868 --> 00:32:44.788
So a couple of just terms here
to get straight.

00:32:44.788 --> 00:32:48.849
His archaic language--you
probably read--he makes a

00:32:48.849 --> 00:32:53.154
distinction between what he
calls constant capital and

00:32:53.154 --> 00:32:54.858
variable capital.
 

00:32:54.858 --> 00:32:59.994
All you need to think about
there is capital is what the

00:32:59.994 --> 00:33:04.288
capitalist spends in the
productive process.

00:33:04.288 --> 00:33:09.160
Variable capital is wages,
and constant capital is

00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:10.950
everything else.
 

00:33:10.950 --> 00:33:14.843
Sometimes he uses these
symbols: C means all capital,

00:33:14.843 --> 00:33:18.788
big C means all capital;
little c means everything the

00:33:18.788 --> 00:33:21.960
capitalist spends on things
other than wages;

00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:25.130
and V is spent on wages.
 

00:33:25.130 --> 00:33:28.788
And why he might call it
variable?

00:33:28.788 --> 00:33:34.070
So the idea is that wages are
always driven toward

00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:35.579
subsistence.
 

00:33:35.579 --> 00:33:39.720
This is an empirical assumption.
 

00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:42.740
Marx makes a few empirical
assumptions.

00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:46.328
Of all the empirical
assumptions he makes this is the

00:33:46.328 --> 00:33:49.160
one that actually is the most
accurate.

00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:52.280
He wants to say there are
always some unemployed in

00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:55.355
capitalist economies,
and because there are always

00:33:55.355 --> 00:33:57.720
some unemployed in capitalist
economies,

00:33:57.720 --> 00:34:00.630
wages will be driven towards
subsistence.

00:34:00.630 --> 00:34:05.528
Because if you have,
say, a union that organizes and

00:34:05.528 --> 00:34:11.101
drives up wages the employer
will then go and hire nonunion

00:34:11.101 --> 00:34:14.860
workers and say,
"Well, will you work for

00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:17.800
me at something lower than the
union wage?"

00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:22.913
and the answer will be yes,
because the unemployed worker

00:34:22.913 --> 00:34:25.469
won't have a choice,
okay?

00:34:25.469 --> 00:34:29.230
So wages will be driven towards
subsistence.

00:34:29.230 --> 00:34:32.000
Now that puts on the table
another question.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:35.590
Well, what is subsistence?
 

00:34:35.590 --> 00:34:37.739
What is subsistence?
 

00:34:37.739 --> 00:34:41.757
And Marx does say, "Well,
it has a social and historical

00:34:41.757 --> 00:34:44.773
element,"
so that is to say in a society

00:34:44.773 --> 00:34:48.681
like ours a definition of
subsistence might include having

00:34:48.681 --> 00:34:52.659
enough money to buy a car in
order to drive to work,

00:34:52.659 --> 00:34:56.137
whereas obviously that was not
true in nineteenth-century

00:34:56.137 --> 00:34:59.010
Britain,
so what counts as subsistence

00:34:59.010 --> 00:34:59.690
changes.
 

00:34:59.690 --> 00:35:05.007
And we will see there are other
features of Marx's theory of

00:35:05.007 --> 00:35:10.143
capitalism which show that
there's actually an impetus for

00:35:10.143 --> 00:35:13.840
what counts as subsistence to go
up,

00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:19.199
but at any given time the
accepted level of subsistence,

00:35:19.199 --> 00:35:23.545
and the wages will be driven
toward that because of the

00:35:23.545 --> 00:35:27.489
existence of what he
flamboyantly describes as the

00:35:27.489 --> 00:35:30.869
reserve army of the unemployed,
right?

00:35:30.869 --> 00:35:35.480
That's what keeps wages at
subsistence or close to it in a

00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:37.260
competitive economy.
 

00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:48.780
Okay, let's do a little micro
transaction.

00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:52.590
Suppose there's a working day,
okay?

00:35:52.590 --> 00:36:02.559
And suppose the accepted
working day is ten hours long.

00:36:02.559 --> 00:36:05.077
Marx says, "Well think
about what the worker is

00:36:05.077 --> 00:36:05.768
doing."
 

00:36:05.768 --> 00:36:09.260
The worker is producing cotton,
let's say;

00:36:09.260 --> 00:36:11.309
it doesn't really matter what.
 

00:36:11.309 --> 00:36:17.070
And for some portion of that
working day the cotton that he's

00:36:17.070 --> 00:36:22.925
producing, when eventually sold,
is going to cover the cost of

00:36:22.925 --> 00:36:24.268
his wages.
 

00:36:24.268 --> 00:36:28.550
So the worker produces cotton
all day long,

00:36:28.550 --> 00:36:32.099
and the capitalist eventually
sells the cotton,

00:36:32.099 --> 00:36:37.891
right, and gets something for
it, and then he's got to pay his

00:36:37.891 --> 00:36:39.599
worker his wage.
 

00:36:39.599 --> 00:36:44.478
And we're just going to say for
the purposes of this example

00:36:44.478 --> 00:36:49.442
that the work that's done in the
first four hours is going to

00:36:49.442 --> 00:36:53.985
cover the wage bill,
and the rest is what Marx

00:36:53.985 --> 00:36:55.570
called surplus.
 

00:36:55.570 --> 00:36:58.541
So that's the difference
between necessary and surplus

00:36:58.541 --> 00:36:59.268
labor time.
 

00:36:59.268 --> 00:37:02.545
And Marx has the idea of a rate
of exploitation,

00:37:02.545 --> 00:37:06.449
which is the ratio of necessary
to surplus labor time.

00:37:06.449 --> 00:37:11.438
You could even make a little
index, and so you'd say it's one

00:37:11.438 --> 00:37:12.518
point five.
 

00:37:12.518 --> 00:37:17.219
Okay, so this is the value
that's produced that covers the

00:37:17.219 --> 00:37:18.210
wage bill.
 

00:37:18.210 --> 00:37:19.369
This is the rest.
 

00:37:19.369 --> 00:37:22.559
Of course this isn't all
profit, right?

00:37:22.559 --> 00:37:26.429
Why isn't it profit?
 

00:37:26.429 --> 00:37:29.239
Why isn't all that profit,
somebody?

00:37:29.239 --> 00:37:32.550
 
 

00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:34.081
Think about it.
 

00:37:34.081 --> 00:37:36.125
You're a capitalist.
 

00:37:36.125 --> 00:37:36.840
Yeah?
 

00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:39.222
Student: Because some money
goes to the actual,

00:37:39.222 --> 00:37:42.432
I guess, building where they're
working or even material needed

00:37:42.432 --> 00:37:43.780
to create the product.
 

00:37:43.780 --> 00:37:44.945
Professor Ian Shapiro:
Exactly.

00:37:44.945 --> 00:37:46.579
The capitalist has to buy raw
material,

00:37:46.579 --> 00:37:50.123
has to do advertising,
has to have a system of

00:37:50.123 --> 00:37:53.322
managers,
research and development,

00:37:53.322 --> 00:37:56.929
all of that has to be paid out
of this.

00:37:56.929 --> 00:38:02.407
So profit is some subset of
this, but it's not all of this,

00:38:02.407 --> 00:38:03.070
okay.
 

00:38:03.070 --> 00:38:09.434
Okay, so we're in the cotton
business, and it's a competitive

00:38:09.434 --> 00:38:14.632
business, and so another cotton
manufacturer says,

00:38:14.632 --> 00:38:17.179
"You know what?
 

00:38:17.179 --> 00:38:19.760
I think these workers are
slacking.

00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:24.617
I'm going to say from now on to
my workers, 'You work eleven

00:38:24.617 --> 00:38:27.333
hours.'"
Wages are already at

00:38:27.333 --> 00:38:30.380
subsistence by assumption,
right?

00:38:30.380 --> 00:38:34.965
So the workers might say,
"No we're not,"

00:38:34.965 --> 00:38:37.887
and they can say,
"Goodbye,

00:38:37.887 --> 00:38:41.307
I'll somebody unemployed to do
it then,"

00:38:41.307 --> 00:38:41.929
okay?
 

00:38:41.929 --> 00:38:48.239
So if you do that we now have
an eleven-hour working day.

00:38:48.239 --> 00:38:52.193
The rate of exploitation goes
up, right, because now there are

00:38:52.193 --> 00:38:56.081
seven hours of surplus labor
rather than six hours of surplus

00:38:56.081 --> 00:38:56.730
labor.
 

00:38:56.730 --> 00:39:00.443
Now you might say, "Well,
the worker's going to get worn

00:39:00.443 --> 00:39:04.677
out sooner and die sooner,"
but let's just suspend

00:39:04.677 --> 00:39:07.775
disbelief about that,
and say, in fact,

00:39:07.775 --> 00:39:11.989
so this capitalist is going to
do better than this capitalist;

00:39:11.989 --> 00:39:19.367
so this capitalist is going to
be able to sell his or product

00:39:19.367 --> 00:39:24.530
more cheaply,
and therefore this capitalist

00:39:24.530 --> 00:39:28.219
is going to be in trouble.
 

00:39:28.219 --> 00:39:32.581
People think in Marxism,
capitalists are afraid of the

00:39:32.581 --> 00:39:33.900
working class.
 

00:39:33.900 --> 00:39:34.414
No.
 

00:39:34.414 --> 00:39:42.639
On Marx's theory who is a
capitalist afraid of?

00:39:42.639 --> 00:39:47.030
Who is the capitalist looking
over his should at?

00:39:47.030 --> 00:39:48.510
Student: The other capitalist.
 

00:39:48.510 --> 00:39:50.686
Professor Ian Shapiro:
Yeah, the capitalist down the

00:39:50.686 --> 00:39:51.070
street.
 

00:39:51.070 --> 00:39:53.382
He couldn't care less
about--he's not worried about

00:39:53.382 --> 00:39:54.030
the workers.
 

00:39:54.030 --> 00:39:58.414
He's worried about the
capitalist who can come into his

00:39:58.414 --> 00:40:02.150
industry and produce more
effectively, okay?

00:40:02.150 --> 00:40:07.153
So if you can make these
workers work an extra hour,

00:40:07.153 --> 00:40:09.510
you're going to do it.
 

00:40:09.510 --> 00:40:13.364
And then everybody else is
going to have to do it,

00:40:13.364 --> 00:40:17.139
right, or they're going to go
out of business.

00:40:17.139 --> 00:40:21.829
And this is why Marx wants to
say, this is what he calls an

00:40:21.829 --> 00:40:24.739
increasing absolute surplus
value.

00:40:24.739 --> 00:40:28.036
This is why Marx says,
"Under primitive

00:40:28.036 --> 00:40:30.409
capitalism,
in the early stages of

00:40:30.409 --> 00:40:33.896
capitalism, the battles are
going to be over things like the

00:40:33.896 --> 00:40:35.610
length of the working day.
 

00:40:35.610 --> 00:40:39.059
If any of you've done
nineteenth-century British

00:40:39.059 --> 00:40:42.949
history you will know that one
of the big battles--

00:40:42.949 --> 00:40:47.041
this starts with the chartists
in the early nineteenth century

00:40:47.041 --> 00:40:47.980
and goes on.
 

00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:49.030
What are they pushing for?
 

00:40:49.030 --> 00:40:52.409
The Ten Hours Bill,
they want the Ten Hours Bill.

00:40:52.409 --> 00:40:56.628
They want Parliament to come in
and say, "Working day's ten

00:40:56.628 --> 00:40:58.570
hours," to limit this.
 

00:40:58.570 --> 00:41:02.788
So to the extent that the
workers can organize politically

00:41:02.788 --> 00:41:07.449
and put pressure to get a Ten
Hours Bill then you limit this.

00:41:07.449 --> 00:41:09.702
But in any case,
Marx wants to say,

00:41:09.702 --> 00:41:13.416
"There are only so many
hours in a day and people do

00:41:13.416 --> 00:41:15.670
have to sleep after all."
 

00:41:15.670 --> 00:41:20.360
So you're not going to get much
out of this.

00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:27.117
The real secret to capitalism's
dynamism is not the move from A

00:41:27.117 --> 00:41:27.880
to B.
 

00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:32.079
It's the move from A to C."
 

00:41:32.079 --> 00:41:35.099
Notice here we're back at a Ten
Hours Day,

00:41:35.099 --> 00:41:40.007
but now, by assumption,
I'm saying the capitalist is

00:41:40.007 --> 00:41:45.588
going to cover his wage bill for
that worker in three hours

00:41:45.588 --> 00:41:47.610
rather than four.
 

00:41:47.610 --> 00:41:49.309
How is he going to do that?
 

00:41:49.309 --> 00:41:50.590
Yeah? Student: Reduce wages.
 

00:41:50.590 --> 00:41:51.936
Professor Ian Shapiro:
Pardon?

00:41:51.936 --> 00:41:53.050
Student: Reduce wages.
 

00:41:53.050 --> 00:41:55.206
Professor Ian Shapiro:
But you can't reduce wages

00:41:55.206 --> 00:41:57.139
because wages are already at
subsistence.

00:41:57.139 --> 00:42:02.239
So you're going to have to,
by assumption,

00:42:02.239 --> 00:42:10.199
you have to pay the same wages,
so how are you going to do it?

00:42:10.199 --> 00:42:11.195
Student: Technology.
 

00:42:11.195 --> 00:42:13.389
Professor Ian Shapiro:
Technology, exactly.

00:42:13.389 --> 00:42:15.260
The name of the game is
technology.

00:42:15.260 --> 00:42:19.364
Somebody's going to go and buy
a spinning jenny and put it in

00:42:19.364 --> 00:42:22.833
his factory,
and then the workers will work

00:42:22.833 --> 00:42:27.385
way more productively,
and as a result of that,

00:42:27.385 --> 00:42:33.230
the capitalist will cover his
wage bill more quickly.

00:42:33.230 --> 00:42:36.596
And of course,
the minute one capitalist put

00:42:36.596 --> 00:42:41.293
the spinning jenny in everybody
has to put the spinning jenny

00:42:41.293 --> 00:42:43.500
in,
right, or else they're going to

00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:44.518
go out of business.
 

00:42:44.518 --> 00:42:48.626
Because the capitalist that's
covering his wage bill in three

00:42:48.626 --> 00:42:52.184
hours of that worker's work,
rather than four,

00:42:52.184 --> 00:42:56.996
is going to be able to sell the
cotton more cheaply in the

00:42:56.996 --> 00:43:01.893
market and therefore outcompete
the capitalist who is still

00:43:01.893 --> 00:43:04.090
using the old system.
 

00:43:04.090 --> 00:43:08.994
And so the way capitalism works
is that there's constant

00:43:08.994 --> 00:43:12.650
pressure for technological
innovation,

00:43:12.650 --> 00:43:17.688
because this is not a very
effective way of increasing

00:43:17.688 --> 00:43:19.780
productivity,
right?

00:43:19.780 --> 00:43:21.550
In the early stages you'll see
that,

00:43:21.550 --> 00:43:23.820
but there will be political
limits,

00:43:23.820 --> 00:43:25.869
Ten Hours Bill,
they'll be natural limits,

00:43:25.869 --> 00:43:29.612
human capacity,
so then all the pressure is on

00:43:29.612 --> 00:43:31.360
dynamic innovation.
 

00:43:31.360 --> 00:43:41.130
Okay, now this is where it gets
interesting,

00:43:41.130 --> 00:43:46.364
because what he wants to say
is, "But we know that only

00:43:46.364 --> 00:43:51.068
living human labor power
produces surplus value,"

00:43:51.068 --> 00:43:55.860
so as you become more and more
capital intensive,

00:43:55.860 --> 00:43:59.269
the capitalist is spending more
and more on constant capital and

00:43:59.269 --> 00:44:01.219
less and less on variable
capital.

00:44:01.219 --> 00:44:05.175
To put it in modern jargon,
production's becoming more

00:44:05.175 --> 00:44:06.670
capital intensive.
 

00:44:06.670 --> 00:44:14.405
You're spending more and more
of your investment on something

00:44:14.405 --> 00:44:18.789
that does not produce new value.
 

00:44:18.789 --> 00:44:21.619
So another way you can think
about this,

00:44:21.619 --> 00:44:25.570
and remember I said to you last
time,

00:44:25.570 --> 00:44:28.788
all the classical political
economists thought they had to

00:44:28.788 --> 00:44:31.949
explain the declining tendency
and the rate of profit.

00:44:31.949 --> 00:44:40.079
What Marx wants to say is,
if this is the status quo,

00:44:40.079 --> 00:44:44.344
okay, and one capitalist in the
cotton industry puts in the

00:44:44.344 --> 00:44:48.018
spinning jenny and this becomes
the status quo,

00:44:48.018 --> 00:44:51.251
this capitalist will have
higher profits than this

00:44:51.251 --> 00:44:52.570
capitalist, right?
 

00:44:52.570 --> 00:44:55.619
But once they've all put in the
spinning jenny,

00:44:55.619 --> 00:44:59.202
the rate of profit in the
cotton industry will be lower

00:44:59.202 --> 00:45:01.590
than it was up here,"
okay?

00:45:01.590 --> 00:45:05.753
So there's a short-run/long-run
conflict of interest for

00:45:05.753 --> 00:45:09.992
capitalists because in the
short-run at the margin I will

00:45:09.992 --> 00:45:13.018
innovate and my profits will go
up,

00:45:13.018 --> 00:45:17.862
but then everybody will copy me
and the rate of profit in the

00:45:17.862 --> 00:45:20.929
cotton industry will fall over
time.

00:45:20.929 --> 00:45:26.309
Now, there are some dubious
assumptions,

00:45:26.309 --> 00:45:30.750
which I'm going to come back to
on Monday,

00:45:30.750 --> 00:45:35.800
but I first want to just draw
your attention to some of the

00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:38.239
normative aspects of this.
 

00:45:38.239 --> 00:45:41.737
What Marx calls the rate of
exploitation,

00:45:41.737 --> 00:45:46.809
as I said, is the ratio of
surplus to necessary labor time,

00:45:46.809 --> 00:45:50.920
but now look down the right
hand side here.

00:45:50.920 --> 00:45:56.929
He's got all this jargon but
you can unpack it here.

00:45:56.929 --> 00:45:59.179
S over V is the rate of
exploitation.

00:45:59.179 --> 00:46:03.469
All these things are basically
equivalent ratio.

00:46:03.469 --> 00:46:07.268
But look down here,
and now think about this.

00:46:07.268 --> 00:46:12.351
Suppose I was a capitalist and
you were a worker working for

00:46:12.351 --> 00:46:13.300
me, okay?
 

00:46:13.300 --> 00:46:17.268
And suppose I said,
"Times are tough in the

00:46:17.268 --> 00:46:18.789
cotton industry.
 

00:46:18.789 --> 00:46:20.730
You've got a choice.
 

00:46:20.730 --> 00:46:24.500
We can go to here or we can go
to here.

00:46:24.500 --> 00:46:30.329
We can pick B or we can pick C,
but A is no longer an option.

00:46:30.329 --> 00:46:36.690
A means I'm moving to Mexico,
can't do A anymore.

00:46:36.690 --> 00:46:39.800
So take your pick B or C."
 

00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:41.699
How many are going to pick B?
 

00:46:41.699 --> 00:46:43.530
Hands up.
 

00:46:43.530 --> 00:46:45.320
How many are going to pick C?
 

00:46:45.320 --> 00:46:48.329
Everybody.
 

00:46:48.329 --> 00:46:52.239
But then it seems like this is
very counter intuitive,

00:46:52.239 --> 00:46:53.199
doesn't it?
 

00:46:53.199 --> 00:47:00.489
Because you all went for
something that,

00:47:00.489 --> 00:47:03.092
according to Marx,
has a higher rate of

00:47:03.092 --> 00:47:07.237
exploitation,
two point three-three as

00:47:07.237 --> 00:47:11.429
opposed to one point seven-five.
 

00:47:11.429 --> 00:47:15.090
 
 

00:47:15.090 --> 00:47:16.599
How can that be?
 

00:47:16.599 --> 00:47:19.360
How can that make any sense?
 

00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:23.449
Okay, I'm going to go two
minutes over here to leave you

00:47:23.449 --> 00:47:27.539
with this to think about,
and then we'll pick up with it

00:47:27.539 --> 00:47:28.579
on Monday.
 

00:47:28.579 --> 00:47:30.260
This is the intuition.
 

00:47:30.260 --> 00:47:38.266
If you think about how people
think about how well off they

00:47:38.266 --> 00:47:44.333
are the Pareto system says,
"Am I on a higher or lower

00:47:44.333 --> 00:47:47.250
indifference curve than I was on
before?"

00:47:47.250 --> 00:47:52.163
It's a bit like when Ronald
Reagan was running for

00:47:52.163 --> 00:47:55.284
reelection in 1984,
his slogan was,

00:47:55.284 --> 00:47:58.880
"Are you better off than
you were four years ago,"

00:47:58.880 --> 00:47:59.429
right?
 

00:47:59.429 --> 00:48:01.940
You look at your situation and
you say, "What was my

00:48:01.940 --> 00:48:02.480
situation?
 

00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:05.130
Is it better? Is it worse?"
 

00:48:05.130 --> 00:48:07.619
a self-referential comparison.
 

00:48:07.619 --> 00:48:11.083
Marx says, "No,
that's not the relevant

00:48:11.083 --> 00:48:12.130
comparison.
 

00:48:12.130 --> 00:48:15.829
The relevant comparison is
other referential."

00:48:15.829 --> 00:48:20.106
You decide how well off you are
not just by reference to what

00:48:20.106 --> 00:48:23.530
you get compared to with what
you got before,

00:48:23.530 --> 00:48:26.820
but by reference to what others
are getting.

00:48:26.820 --> 00:48:29.539
So that in this kind of
situation if you say,

00:48:29.539 --> 00:48:32.260
"Which is worse for the
worker?"

00:48:32.260 --> 00:48:36.791
they may well say that a
situation in which they have

00:48:36.791 --> 00:48:42.021
more is worse than a situation
in which they have less if the

00:48:42.021 --> 00:48:44.550
capitalist has even more.
 

00:48:44.550 --> 00:48:48.119
So Marx wants to say,
"We're inherently

00:48:48.119 --> 00:48:49.780
other-referential.
 

00:48:49.780 --> 00:48:53.867
What's going to make us more or
less happy is not just what we

00:48:53.867 --> 00:48:57.420
have, but what we have in
relation to others."

00:48:57.420 --> 00:49:02.018
So now, and it turns out on
this matter he was half-right.

00:49:02.018 --> 00:49:07.994
He was half-right,
we see, from a hundred years of

00:49:07.994 --> 00:49:10.800
studies of sociology.
 

00:49:10.800 --> 00:49:17.710
What people find acceptable and
desirable is connected to what

00:49:17.710 --> 00:49:21.275
others have,
but usually it's connected,

00:49:21.275 --> 00:49:23.900
and this is where he was
half-wrong,

00:49:23.900 --> 00:49:28.244
it's usually connected to what
people who are similarly

00:49:28.244 --> 00:49:30.659
situated to themselves have.
 

00:49:30.659 --> 00:49:35.052
So workers in the steel
industry will compare themselves

00:49:35.052 --> 00:49:39.672
to workers in the auto industry,
but workers in the auto

00:49:39.672 --> 00:49:44.188
industry will not compare
themselves to what executives in

00:49:44.188 --> 00:49:46.170
the auto industry get.
 

00:49:46.170 --> 00:49:48.436
So people are
other-referential,

00:49:48.436 --> 00:49:50.849
but in a more horizontal sense.
 

00:49:50.849 --> 00:49:54.099
And this is true up and down
the occupational scale.

00:49:54.099 --> 00:49:59.208
So if you have been a Yale
administrator one thing you will

00:49:59.208 --> 00:50:04.494
learn is it will matter much
more to a professor if he or she

00:50:04.494 --> 00:50:09.425
learns he's being paid two
thousand dollars less than the

00:50:09.425 --> 00:50:14.523
professor down the corridor,
than if he or she learns he or

00:50:14.523 --> 00:50:18.483
she is being paid two hundred
thousand dollars less than the

00:50:18.483 --> 00:50:21.170
attorney who lives next door to
them.

00:50:21.170 --> 00:50:25.168
People compare themselves to
others, but they compare

00:50:25.168 --> 00:50:28.400
themselves to similarly-situated
others.

00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:32.351
Why that is,
is an immensely complicated and

00:50:32.351 --> 00:50:36.579
interesting subject,
but it means that Marx was

00:50:36.579 --> 00:50:41.449
right to think we're basically
other-referential.

00:50:41.449 --> 00:50:45.364
We don't just ask the question
"Has my utility gone up or

00:50:45.364 --> 00:50:46.199
down?"
 

00:50:46.199 --> 00:50:50.764
We do compare ourselves to
others, but he was mistaken in

00:50:50.764 --> 00:50:54.679
thinking that workers would
compare themselves to

00:50:54.679 --> 00:50:59.733
capitalists rather than to other
workers in deciding whether or

00:50:59.733 --> 00:51:03.978
not they were well off,
and that would feed into his

00:51:03.978 --> 00:51:07.835
assumptions about the conditions
under which workers would be

00:51:07.835 --> 00:51:09.699
likely to become militant.
 

00:51:09.699 --> 00:51:13.940
Okay, we'll start with that
issue on Monday.

00:51:13.940 --> 00:51:19.000

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:06.086
Professor Donald
Kagan: We were discussing,

00:00:06.086 --> 00:00:09.759
in the broadest sense,
the emergence and the

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:14.712
development of the polis
and specifically I had been

00:00:14.712 --> 00:00:19.581
telling you about Hanson's
theory about the development of

00:00:19.581 --> 00:00:23.766
the family farm and the
individuals who worked the

00:00:23.766 --> 00:00:28.720
family farm as a critical
element in that story.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:34.318
Now, that same individual who
produced the economic

00:00:34.318 --> 00:00:40.700
wherewithal that would support
independent individuals,

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.969
who are not nobleman,
and who could conduct their

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:47.987
lives in an autonomous way and
who fought ultimately--fought

00:00:47.987 --> 00:00:51.733
their way onto governmental
bodies which allowed them to

00:00:51.733 --> 00:00:54.390
participate in the key
decisions,

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.532
political decisions,
and all other decisions in the

00:00:57.532 --> 00:01:01.304
state that served the element of
their character and of their

00:01:01.304 --> 00:01:04.069
place in the world.
That is the one that I want to

00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:07.178
turn to today.
Their role as soldiers,

00:01:07.178 --> 00:01:13.033
fighting for the common
cause--and that common cause now

00:01:13.033 --> 00:01:17.847
being not an individual goal,
not a family goal,

00:01:17.847 --> 00:01:21.132
but the goal of the entire
civic community,

00:01:21.132 --> 00:01:26.058
which was coming into being and
I suppose would have had to come

00:01:26.058 --> 00:01:30.343
into being,
in order to have this role,

00:01:30.343 --> 00:01:34.050
fighting for one's
polis.

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:40.116
The style of warfare that
emerges in this period,

00:01:40.116 --> 00:01:46.658
apparently for the first time,
is what we call the hoplite

00:01:46.658 --> 00:01:52.170
phalanx and each half of that
needs to be explained.

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.515
Hoplite comes from the Greek
word hoplites and

00:01:56.515 --> 00:02:01.697
hoplites is built around
the word hoplon which is

00:02:01.697 --> 00:02:06.209
the name of a kind of shield
that the infantrymen,

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:13.625
and we are talking about an
infantry formation here,

00:02:13.625 --> 00:02:16.387
carried.
You want to get out of your

00:02:16.387 --> 00:02:19.147
head the notion of a shield
that's a little thing that you

00:02:19.147 --> 00:02:21.810
can move around with one hand,
like that, real easy;

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:27.104
that's not what it was.
It was a great round shield

00:02:27.104 --> 00:02:35.729
about three feet across and it
had--let me step out here so

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:41.830
that I can show you.
Can you hear me back there?

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.274
Is that all right?
Imagine a round shield of the

00:02:46.274 --> 00:02:49.615
size I've talked about and one
of the things that's important

00:02:49.615 --> 00:02:51.620
is that at the end of the
shield,

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.268
the right end from my
perspective has a grip on it,

00:02:56.268 --> 00:02:59.430
but in the middle of the
shield,

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.832
there is also a kind of a loose
piece of leather thong that you

00:03:03.832 --> 00:03:07.935
can put your arm through,
so that the shield is resting

00:03:07.935 --> 00:03:12.759
in part on that grip and on the
grip that you hold at this end.

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:17.271
You need to do that to be able
to control the shield that's as

00:03:17.271 --> 00:03:19.860
big as that and as heavy as
that,

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.159
because it is made
fundamentally of a heavy wood,

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:27.267
typically covered by leather,
sometimes with some bronze,

00:03:27.267 --> 00:03:30.710
a bronze sheet across the front
of it as well.

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:36.215
That is a very heavy thing and
it will weigh you down after a

00:03:36.215 --> 00:03:38.637
while.
It's going to be really hard

00:03:38.637 --> 00:03:42.132
for you to maintain that grip on
that thing all through the

00:03:42.132 --> 00:03:46.157
course of a whole battle,
but that shield is the key,

00:03:46.157 --> 00:03:51.440
this hoplon which gives
the name to the word hoplite,

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.930
or hoplites,
which is hoplite.

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:59.238
Phalanx means that
these men, each man carrying his

00:03:59.238 --> 00:04:03.066
hoplon,
are lined up first of all in a

00:04:03.066 --> 00:04:06.449
line,
but that line is reproduced

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:11.360
going back, so that you end with
about--typically,

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.291
a phalanx would have
been eight men deep,

00:04:15.291 --> 00:04:19.139
eight rows deep,
and that block of soldiers,

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:24.210
however long it is,
or is made up--is called the

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:29.819
phalanx, which means
something like roller.

00:04:29.819 --> 00:04:32.237
It's because the phalanx
would have looked,

00:04:32.237 --> 00:04:34.949
if you were up on a hill
somewhere watching it go by,

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:39.782
as though something was rolling
across the plain as the men went

00:04:39.782 --> 00:04:42.850
forward and looking pretty
formidable,

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:46.996
so that anything in its way
would be mowed down in the

00:04:46.996 --> 00:04:50.974
normal course of events.
So that is what we mean by the

00:04:50.974 --> 00:04:55.474
hoplite phalanx.
It's a core of heavily armed

00:04:55.474 --> 00:05:01.293
infantrymen in a solid block.
Okay, when did this come

00:05:01.293 --> 00:05:04.907
into effect?
I'm going to start out today's

00:05:04.907 --> 00:05:09.424
talk by giving you what has been
the standard and orthodox

00:05:09.424 --> 00:05:14.100
interpretation of how the
hoplite phalanx worked,

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:17.592
which, I think,
again Hanson has given us the

00:05:17.592 --> 00:05:20.370
clearest and most useful
account.

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:23.182
But as you know already,
from what you've read,

00:05:23.182 --> 00:05:26.607
this has come into great
dispute in recent years and I'll

00:05:26.607 --> 00:05:30.276
just say a little bit about the
dispute before we get through

00:05:30.276 --> 00:05:32.580
today.
But what I'm giving you is the

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.779
old fashioned traditional
interpretation.

00:05:34.779 --> 00:05:38.863
By that view,
the phalanx would have

00:05:38.863 --> 00:05:44.600
come into being somewhere
between about 700 and 650 B.C.,

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:48.112
which is to say after the
earliest poleis are in

00:05:48.112 --> 00:05:51.300
business, and according to this
interpretation,

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:54.180
you really have them growing up
together.

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:58.459
Nobody could be exactly sure
about how this process worked.

00:05:58.459 --> 00:06:03.079
One of the big arguments that
is part of this story is when

00:06:03.079 --> 00:06:07.620
did this development of new way
of fighting come about;

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:10.994
rather quickly,
over a matter of a few years,

00:06:10.994 --> 00:06:14.600
or did it stretch out over
quite a long time.

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:18.334
The most extreme critics of the
traditional point of view would

00:06:18.334 --> 00:06:20.990
say over centuries,
that you don't get the

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:23.962
full-blown hoplite
phalanx that I will be

00:06:23.962 --> 00:06:27.700
describing to you,
even until you get the fifth

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:32.113
century B.C.
But again, let's take it in the

00:06:32.113 --> 00:06:35.878
traditional way.
So, if you imagine this is

00:06:35.878 --> 00:06:38.946
growing up as the polis
comes into being,

00:06:38.946 --> 00:06:42.472
let me describe what a hoplite
was like and then try to

00:06:42.472 --> 00:06:46.519
describe what the phalanx
was like and how they operated

00:06:46.519 --> 00:06:49.914
and what are some of the
consequences of their coming

00:06:49.914 --> 00:06:53.634
into being.
The hoplite himself is marked

00:06:53.634 --> 00:06:57.629
by, first of all,
the shield and second of all,

00:06:57.629 --> 00:07:03.490
as we continue to think about
his defensive capacities,

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:09.459
he has a certain amount of
armor to protect his body.

00:07:09.459 --> 00:07:13.487
He has on top of his head a
helmet made of bronze,

00:07:13.487 --> 00:07:18.420
perhaps weighing about five
pounds, these are approximate;

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:21.790
they would have differed from
person to person to some degree.

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:26.100
A very important element,
he would have had a breast

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:30.579
plate made of bronze,
perhaps as much as 40 pounds.

00:07:30.579 --> 00:07:34.557
He would have snapped across
his shins, greaves,

00:07:34.557 --> 00:07:39.126
sort of like the shin guards
that a catcher in baseball

00:07:39.126 --> 00:07:43.150
wears, also made of bronze.
The shield itself,

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:47.895
as I've told you is made of a
heavy wood, covered by a leather

00:07:47.895 --> 00:07:51.240
or bronze sheet about three feet
across,

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:56.000
something in the neighborhood
of 16 to 20 pounds worth of

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.569
shield and gripped as I told you
before.

00:07:59.569 --> 00:08:03.736
So you want to think about
his hoplite, when he has

00:08:03.736 --> 00:08:07.439
everything on and when the
shield is in place,

00:08:07.439 --> 00:08:11.240
again let me sort of try to
demonstrate this,

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:16.249
he ought to be covered by some
kind of defense from head to

00:08:16.249 --> 00:08:19.596
toe.
The top is this helmet that

00:08:19.596 --> 00:08:24.810
comes up over his face and
covers it pretty totally.

00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:31.327
It's made of strong metal,
it's got very thin slits to be

00:08:31.327 --> 00:08:36.100
able to see straight ahead,
covered up;

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:40.481
everything else is covered up,
a good one will cover your neck

00:08:40.481 --> 00:08:43.845
as well.
It's very hard to see very much

00:08:43.845 --> 00:08:48.539
and you can't anywhere pretty
much but straight ahead.

00:08:48.539 --> 00:08:52.676
You shouldn't be able to hear
very much either,

00:08:52.676 --> 00:08:58.070
and it mustn't have been too
delightful to breathe out of the

00:08:58.070 --> 00:09:01.072
thing,
although your nose is free,

00:09:01.072 --> 00:09:03.720
but it's covered by a nose
piece.

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:07.208
So there's this guy with this
helmet, it must weigh--I'm

00:09:07.208 --> 00:09:09.878
trying to think.
I always want to--modern

00:09:09.878 --> 00:09:13.571
football helmets which are
monstrous--I'm so old we used to

00:09:13.571 --> 00:09:16.500
play with leather ones without a
face mask.

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:18.230
What do they weigh?
Got any football players here?

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:22.390
I think they weigh a lot.

00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:27.765
I think they're very heavy,
indeed, but I don't know how

00:09:27.765 --> 00:09:30.085
much they weigh.
Anyway, if you imagine sort of

00:09:30.085 --> 00:09:33.184
putting on a modern football
helmet, with that mask in front

00:09:33.184 --> 00:09:35.696
of you,
you would begin to get an idea,

00:09:35.696 --> 00:09:39.347
only begin to get an idea of
what it was like to have that

00:09:39.347 --> 00:09:43.240
bronze helmet on your head.
So there you are with that.

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:48.350
Then you remember that you got
shin guards down to your feet;

00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:53.305
you have this breastplate.
Now, between your waist and

00:09:53.305 --> 00:09:58.727
your shin guard there's some
very delicate territory,

00:09:58.727 --> 00:10:04.019
and there's no armor.
That's what your shield is for.

00:10:04.019 --> 00:10:06.980
Your shield should cover that
territory.

00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:11.064
You want that shield up so that
it pretty well meets your

00:10:11.064 --> 00:10:15.440
helmet, so it's going to be at a
certain distance but it will

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:19.159
also go down to where it needs
to go down here.

00:10:19.159 --> 00:10:23.496
If everything goes right your
enemy won't be able to penetrate

00:10:23.496 --> 00:10:27.690
you, but you should be aware
that there are two places where

00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:30.960
you are relatively vulnerable
for openers,

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:34.666
and that is,
if somebody can come in above

00:10:34.666 --> 00:10:40.000
your shield, your throat is
going to be available to him,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.493
and if somebody can come in
under your shield then your

00:10:43.493 --> 00:10:46.340
vulnerable area will be
vulnerable indeed.

00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:50.956
So, those are places where you
see people get wounded and

00:10:50.956 --> 00:10:55.423
killed, if that can be done.
One other very important

00:10:55.423 --> 00:10:59.624
thing to understand about this
defensive problem and this is

00:10:59.624 --> 00:11:03.611
one of the debatable issues
between the old guard and the

00:11:03.611 --> 00:11:07.072
traditional interpretation;
I'm still giving you the

00:11:07.072 --> 00:11:09.633
traditional view.
If you imagine that your

00:11:09.633 --> 00:11:13.676
hoplite is standing with his
left foot slightly extended in

00:11:13.676 --> 00:11:16.911
front of his right,
and we'll see in a moment it

00:11:16.911 --> 00:11:20.680
pretty well has to be in order
to deal with the spear that he's

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:23.551
grasping,
and if he's holding his shield

00:11:23.551 --> 00:11:27.050
as he must this far,
then he's got a half a shield

00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:30.905
sticking out in this direction
so that he's pretty well

00:11:30.905 --> 00:11:35.498
protected on the left side,
but he's got nothing protecting

00:11:35.498 --> 00:11:38.835
his right side.
If somebody can come at him

00:11:38.835 --> 00:11:42.094
from this side,
he is very vulnerable from

00:11:42.094 --> 00:11:44.623
there.
Now, that's a very important

00:11:44.623 --> 00:11:48.575
point, because why in the world
would you give a shield of the

00:11:48.575 --> 00:11:52.399
kind I am describing,
for a man to defend himself,

00:11:52.399 --> 00:11:56.370
if you imagine him standing by
himself anywhere,

00:11:56.370 --> 00:12:00.210
if you imagine him any distance
from the rest of the guys

00:12:00.210 --> 00:12:03.920
fighting alongside of him.
This has been one of the major

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:07.261
reasons for explaining the
function of the phalanx

00:12:07.261 --> 00:12:10.543
as I will explain it to
you.What are you going to do

00:12:10.543 --> 00:12:13.049
about the vulnerability on this
side?

00:12:13.049 --> 00:12:16.546
Well, the answer is,
in the traditional view,

00:12:16.546 --> 00:12:20.440
is that he was never meant to
stand by himself.

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:25.049
A hoplite only makes sense in a
phalanx.

00:12:25.049 --> 00:12:30.093
A phalanx understood in
this way only makes sense if you

00:12:30.093 --> 00:12:34.173
imagine very close order.
Basically, ideally,

00:12:34.173 --> 00:12:40.021
the right side of my shield is
being met by the left side of

00:12:40.021 --> 00:12:45.572
the shield of the guy to my
right so that we make a solid

00:12:45.572 --> 00:12:51.519
block of soldiers able to defend
ourselves imperfectly,

00:12:51.519 --> 00:12:54.009
but really essentially quite
well.

00:12:54.009 --> 00:12:55.763
Obviously, some of us are going
to get killed,

00:12:55.763 --> 00:12:58.218
some of us are going to go down
and we'll cope with that in just

00:12:58.218 --> 00:13:00.745
a few minutes,
but if you think of us as a

00:13:00.745 --> 00:13:03.990
unit we have a way of
maintaining our security,

00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:09.515
our safety, so long as we
remain in the proper formation

00:13:09.515 --> 00:13:14.259
that I have been describing.
Let me talk about the

00:13:14.259 --> 00:13:17.971
offensive aspect of it.
The idea of going into battle

00:13:17.971 --> 00:13:20.590
is not merely to avoid being
killed;

00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:23.480
the purpose is to kill the
other fellow.

00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:27.914
How do you do it?
The hoplite has two weapons of

00:13:27.914 --> 00:13:32.456
which the most important by far
is a pike, I guess,

00:13:32.456 --> 00:13:36.691
is what we would call it.
It's a spear that you don't

00:13:36.691 --> 00:13:40.741
throw.
It's a spear that you thrust

00:13:40.741 --> 00:13:47.964
and it's got a bronze point,
which is the business end of

00:13:47.964 --> 00:13:52.362
the weapon.
Its length might be anywhere

00:13:52.362 --> 00:13:55.509
from six to eight feet in
length.

00:13:55.509 --> 00:13:59.202
I said bronze,
but actually the tip was

00:13:59.202 --> 00:14:03.769
usually iron,
but it could be bronze as well.

00:14:03.769 --> 00:14:08.272
In addition,
it had a butt made also of

00:14:08.272 --> 00:14:13.129
bronze, which could be a lethal
weapon.

00:14:13.129 --> 00:14:17.480
If I strike you in a vulnerable
place with a stick that has a

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:20.669
bronze butt on it,
it could well kill you.

00:14:20.669 --> 00:14:25.641
It would happen because the
spear itself was made of wood

00:14:25.641 --> 00:14:31.057
and that meant you can count on
it often breaking in the midst

00:14:31.057 --> 00:14:33.070
of battle,
in which case,

00:14:33.070 --> 00:14:36.259
if you have one end of it or
the other you can still have a

00:14:36.259 --> 00:14:39.559
point that you can use to help
yourself in this scrum that it

00:14:39.559 --> 00:14:41.760
is a hoplite phalanx
battle.

00:14:45.509 --> 00:14:49.153
Although I don't quite
understand--I should say,

00:14:49.153 --> 00:14:53.297
there's many things about how
the fighting went on which we

00:14:53.297 --> 00:14:57.512
can only attempt to imagine
because we just don't have films

00:14:57.512 --> 00:15:01.379
of ancient hoplite battles,
I'm sorry to say.

00:15:01.379 --> 00:15:04.450
We have people inventing them,
but even the ones that are

00:15:04.450 --> 00:15:07.576
invented aren't very helpful,
because it's awfully hard to

00:15:07.576 --> 00:15:11.476
know how they did what they did.
But I think we can imagine some

00:15:11.476 --> 00:15:13.899
part of it more easily than the
other.

00:15:13.899 --> 00:15:16.782
What I was going to say is that
you could, at least

00:15:16.782 --> 00:15:19.146
theoretically,
strike with your spear in a

00:15:19.146 --> 00:15:22.490
overhand manner or you could
strike with it in an underhand

00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:24.544
manner,
the only thing is I don't know

00:15:24.544 --> 00:15:26.937
how you do that underhand when
you're in the middle of a

00:15:26.937 --> 00:15:29.633
phalanx.
So, I will be talking about the

00:15:29.633 --> 00:15:32.164
overhand stroke,
which I find it easier to

00:15:32.164 --> 00:15:32.720
grasp.

00:15:36.129 --> 00:15:40.181
So, let's see if I can,
again, give you some sense of

00:15:40.181 --> 00:15:41.740
what this is like.

00:15:46.539 --> 00:15:53.405
Here's a hoplite standing like
this, and when he comes into

00:15:53.405 --> 00:16:00.626
contact with the opposing army,
he will presumably strike down

00:16:00.626 --> 00:16:03.964
in this way.
There are other things that he

00:16:03.964 --> 00:16:05.512
can do.
His shield,

00:16:05.512 --> 00:16:08.457
in addition to being a
defensive thing,

00:16:08.457 --> 00:16:11.789
is also potentially an
offensive weapon.

00:16:11.789 --> 00:16:16.021
He can belt you with that
shield, and if he's stronger

00:16:16.021 --> 00:16:19.134
than you are,
or better prepared or more

00:16:19.134 --> 00:16:22.778
balanced than you are,
he could knock your shield out

00:16:22.778 --> 00:16:25.470
of your hand.
He could knock you back and

00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:28.375
open up a space,
he could knock you down,

00:16:28.375 --> 00:16:32.732
and so you should imagine that
there's at least one chance to

00:16:32.732 --> 00:16:37.386
give a guy shot with the shield,
and after that you could just

00:16:37.386 --> 00:16:41.320
be using it as something to
press the other fellow back and

00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:45.186
you would meanwhile be whacking
away with this in the most

00:16:45.186 --> 00:16:49.324
simple picture that you can have
of how the hoplite would have

00:16:49.324 --> 00:16:53.063
conducted himself.
The other weapon was a short

00:16:53.063 --> 00:16:57.441
sword that he kept at his side,
which presumably he would not

00:16:57.441 --> 00:17:01.820
use so long as he had a spear,
which was a better weapon.

00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:04.313
But if that broke,
if that wasn't available to

00:17:04.313 --> 00:17:06.529
him, he could turn to his short
sword,

00:17:06.529 --> 00:17:11.006
which was a thrusting sword,
not like the Roman short sword

00:17:11.006 --> 00:17:13.940
which was double edged and
slashing.

00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:19.526
You had to stick somebody with
this hoplite phalanx

00:17:19.526 --> 00:17:22.075
sword.
Now, that gives you the

00:17:22.075 --> 00:17:25.985
picture of the individual;
I hope you can get some sense

00:17:25.985 --> 00:17:30.127
of what the phalanx might
be like, but as I try to

00:17:30.127 --> 00:17:33.160
describe how the fighting really
went,

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:36.103
I always find it necessary to
ask for some audience

00:17:36.103 --> 00:17:38.634
participation,
so that you can get some idea

00:17:38.634 --> 00:17:41.460
of what it might have looked
like in a very,

00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:44.774
very limited way.
So, I would like to ask for

00:17:44.774 --> 00:17:48.673
some volunteer hoplites.
The Greeks, as far as I know,

00:17:48.673 --> 00:17:52.950
did not allow anybody to be
left handed in a phalanx;

00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:56.560
think about the problem.
But we don't care;

00:17:56.560 --> 00:17:57.060
you can be a lefty.

00:18:00.890 --> 00:18:03.320
Of course, the Greeks only
allowed men to fight in the

00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:05.338
phalanx,
but we are much more elevated

00:18:05.338 --> 00:18:08.187
than that.
So, I could ask any of you who

00:18:08.187 --> 00:18:12.970
have the courage to come forward
and fight in my phalanx?

00:18:12.970 --> 00:18:14.970
Nobody?
Just come forward.

00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:20.550
I think we got more room here.

00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:48.260
Okay, why don't I have the
shorter people comes toward me

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:51.240
and the taller people go into
the back.

00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:52.650
I think this will make it a
little easier for us,

00:18:52.650 --> 00:18:53.650
just line up next to each
other.

00:18:59.950 --> 00:19:02.160
Right behind him in perfect
order;

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:06.460
the biggest guys in the back,
go ahead.

00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:11.250
Make it a third row;
there's enough for a third row.

00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:12.900
Are we all set?
Back up.

00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:14.681
Make sure you're behind
somebody, directly behind

00:19:14.681 --> 00:19:16.120
somebody.
How many we got up front?

00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:19.609
Four?
Have we got four?

00:19:19.609 --> 00:19:22.080
So we'll have three in the back
that'll be all right.

00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:25.045
Get right behind that guy;
you got to be--boy you got to

00:19:25.045 --> 00:19:29.872
be lined up.
Now, get into your hoplite

00:19:29.872 --> 00:19:35.867
stance, left foot forward.
Okay, now when you're

00:19:35.867 --> 00:19:39.937
fighting, if you're fortunate
enough, and the Greeks were

00:19:39.937 --> 00:19:43.862
sometimes fortunate enough to
fight people who were not

00:19:43.862 --> 00:19:47.437
hoplites,
like when the Persians came at

00:19:47.437 --> 00:19:51.529
them they fought hoplites
against non-hoplites.

00:19:51.529 --> 00:19:55.529
Boy, that's a nice day for a
hoplite.

00:19:55.529 --> 00:19:58.426
The Persian infantry did not
have heavy armor,

00:19:58.426 --> 00:20:01.967
they did not have that kind of
a shield, they had wicker

00:20:01.967 --> 00:20:03.722
shields;
fortunately,

00:20:03.722 --> 00:20:07.490
we have vase paintings that
show us Persians.

00:20:07.490 --> 00:20:10.523
For one thing they're not
dressed like civilized people in

00:20:10.523 --> 00:20:12.280
a dress, they're wearing pants.

00:20:15.799 --> 00:20:19.694
But their shields are made of
wicker and they don't have that

00:20:19.694 --> 00:20:22.680
kind of metal body armor and all
that stuff.

00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:27.680
So, you could blow through that
infantry like butter.

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:32.824
Probably never that easy but
really, you're just not going to

00:20:32.824 --> 00:20:37.453
lose, and the truth of the
matter is that hoplites beat

00:20:37.453 --> 00:20:42.426
non-hoplites in all battles that
are fought on flat land in

00:20:42.426 --> 00:20:45.769
battles that the Greeks fight
in.

00:20:45.769 --> 00:20:50.028
I just want to tell you
about--in Herodotus,

00:20:50.028 --> 00:20:55.012
he tells the tale about how the
fighting went versus the

00:20:55.012 --> 00:20:58.307
Persians,
and here's the line he says,

00:20:58.307 --> 00:21:02.843
"Once the Greeks go to war they
choose the best and smoothest

00:21:02.843 --> 00:21:06.700
place to go down and have their
battle on that."

00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:10.372
That wasn't just because they
sort of had an aesthetic

00:21:10.372 --> 00:21:14.554
pleasure in nice flat fields.
That's what you need for a

00:21:14.554 --> 00:21:17.527
phalanx,
because to maintain the

00:21:17.527 --> 00:21:21.771
integrity of the hoplite line,
you can't have bumps and

00:21:21.771 --> 00:21:24.680
grooves, and trees and rivers in
the way;

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:27.887
it will break things up.
So, they do,

00:21:27.887 --> 00:21:31.968
in fact, seek such a field.
So if you're fighting a

00:21:31.968 --> 00:21:34.869
non-hoplite infantry crowd,
you're in great shape.

00:21:34.869 --> 00:21:39.384
But what the Greeks spent most
of their time doing was fighting

00:21:39.384 --> 00:21:43.243
each other, one hoplite
phalanx against another

00:21:43.243 --> 00:21:47.240
hoplite phalanx.
So, you have to imagine

00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:51.527
that this thing started with
these guys back in their camp

00:21:51.527 --> 00:21:54.460
and the other army back in its
camp,

00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:58.482
and they both have to agree
that they want to have a battle,

00:21:58.482 --> 00:22:01.838
for a battle to take place,
and they will have picked a

00:22:01.838 --> 00:22:04.750
place that is flat where they
can do what they're doing.

00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:08.961
Usually, the battle took place
over some land that was being

00:22:08.961 --> 00:22:13.387
contested on a frontier and they
would go down to that area and

00:22:13.387 --> 00:22:18.170
pick a spot and there they would
go and fight with one another.

00:22:18.170 --> 00:22:22.480
So now, the two armies are
lined up.

00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:28.156
Here's an interesting question:
how wide is the line going to

00:22:28.156 --> 00:22:31.192
be?
Well, that's not an answer that

00:22:31.192 --> 00:22:36.069
is entirely at the disposal of
the general, because he's got

00:22:36.069 --> 00:22:40.119
two considerations that he has
to worry about.

00:22:40.119 --> 00:22:44.538
One is, he can't afford to have
his hoplite line outflanked,

00:22:44.538 --> 00:22:48.881
because if I can come around
and take care of this guy from

00:22:48.881 --> 00:22:52.023
this side,
he is engaged with a guy who's

00:22:52.023 --> 00:22:55.442
right opposite him,
I can just kill him no problem

00:22:55.442 --> 00:22:58.643
at all.
So, he has got to at least try

00:22:58.643 --> 00:23:02.982
to be equal with the guy who's
furthest on this side,

00:23:02.982 --> 00:23:06.569
and same with the guy on the
other side.

00:23:06.569 --> 00:23:10.191
So, that means he's got to make
his line unless he comes up with

00:23:10.191 --> 00:23:13.180
some clever trick,
the same size as the other guy.

00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:18.769
Well, typically the two
armies aren't identical in size.

00:23:18.769 --> 00:23:23.157
So, if you're going to try to
be the same breadth across the

00:23:23.157 --> 00:23:26.950
field that's going to affect how
deep you can be,

00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:31.849
and depth as we shall see once
we get started fighting is

00:23:31.849 --> 00:23:35.700
relevant in ways that we need to
work out,

00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:38.982
but if one phalanx is
eight deep and the other

00:23:38.982 --> 00:23:43.000
phalanx is 12 deep,
the 12 deep phalanx has

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.608
an advantage.
So, numbers count,

00:23:45.608 --> 00:23:50.802
but it's not an easy one-to-one
question, various issues will

00:23:50.802 --> 00:23:56.157
determine who comes out ahead.
Okay, now let's make this first

00:23:56.157 --> 00:24:01.313
battle I'm going to describe for
you to be as clear cut as we can

00:24:01.313 --> 00:24:05.180
make it, and it probably never
was like that.

00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:09.245
Let's imagine my army is the
same size as theirs precisely,

00:24:09.245 --> 00:24:12.750
so that the line is the same
size on both sides;

00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:19.986
therefore, also the same depth.
So, we'll just do this

00:24:19.986 --> 00:24:21.720
imaginary perfect battle.

00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:31.057
As the two armies approach each
other, I should make it clear,

00:24:31.057 --> 00:24:34.509
they start out walking at a
certain clip.

00:24:34.509 --> 00:24:38.039
By the way, it's critical that
they should stay in formation;

00:24:38.039 --> 00:24:39.750
nobody should get ahead of
anybody else.

00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:43.046
How do you do that?
With rhythm and in subsequent

00:24:43.046 --> 00:24:46.944
armies later in history,
they used drums to maintain

00:24:46.944 --> 00:24:50.178
that technique.
The Greeks did it by the

00:24:50.178 --> 00:24:54.825
playing of a flute like or oboe
like instrument that played a

00:24:54.825 --> 00:24:59.085
military tune that had you
marching forward at the right

00:24:59.085 --> 00:25:01.410
pace.
That was very, very important.

00:25:01.410 --> 00:25:04.035
So you're marching forward
at that pace,

00:25:04.035 --> 00:25:07.088
but now as you get closer and
closer to each other,

00:25:07.088 --> 00:25:10.020
various items begin to affect
your behavior.

00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:16.880
One is, I would think, fear.
In fact, I know--fear.

00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:21.003
So, what do you do,
supposing, if you feel like

00:25:21.003 --> 00:25:24.435
running?
Can you boys in the first row

00:25:24.435 --> 00:25:27.410
run anywhere?
You got seven guys behind you;

00:25:27.410 --> 00:25:29.912
that's not even an option and
that's a very important aspect

00:25:29.912 --> 00:25:32.500
of the phalanx.
That's not even an issue.

00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:34.150
So, if you're afraid,
what are you afraid of?

00:25:34.150 --> 00:25:37.298
Well, the other guy has got
people--I should have mentioned

00:25:37.298 --> 00:25:39.832
on the sidelines,
one way or another,

00:25:39.832 --> 00:25:43.628
shooting arrows at you,
throwing javelins at you,

00:25:43.628 --> 00:25:47.045
things like that.
You want to get through that as

00:25:47.045 --> 00:25:49.650
fast as you can,
and engage with the enemy.

00:25:49.650 --> 00:25:53.470
But there's another reason why
you want to get there fast is

00:25:53.470 --> 00:25:57.351
because, well by now,
I should have pointed out that

00:25:57.351 --> 00:26:02.374
we know that before you started
out the battle that your general

00:26:02.374 --> 00:26:06.759
gave you a meal and he also gave
you plenty of wine,

00:26:06.759 --> 00:26:10.855
so that by the time you're in
this position,

00:26:10.855 --> 00:26:14.569
you've had a few and there's--I
mean,

00:26:14.569 --> 00:26:17.030
there's a science to that too
as perhaps some of you know.

00:26:17.030 --> 00:26:19.826
No you don't.
College students do not have a

00:26:19.826 --> 00:26:22.333
science of this at all,
they just pour the stuff down

00:26:22.333 --> 00:26:25.226
their throats with the goal of
becoming drunk as fast as they

00:26:25.226 --> 00:26:28.316
can.
That's barbaric in the

00:26:28.316 --> 00:26:31.731
technical sense.
I mean, the Greeks

00:26:31.731 --> 00:26:33.710
didn't--Plato's
Symposium,

00:26:33.710 --> 00:26:37.670
all of these guys are sitting
around having a drinking party.

00:26:37.670 --> 00:26:41.954
That's all they do all night,
but they also are talking and

00:26:41.954 --> 00:26:45.500
they're talking very well as a
matter of fact,

00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:49.079
and the goal of this
conversation is,

00:26:49.079 --> 00:26:54.052
or of this party rather,
symposium means by the way

00:26:54.052 --> 00:26:57.919
drinking together.
So they're drinking and they're

00:26:57.919 --> 00:27:01.116
talking, and both of these are
supposed to go on at the same

00:27:01.116 --> 00:27:02.759
time.
And here's the thing;

00:27:02.759 --> 00:27:08.960
the idea is to drink as much as
you can without passing out and

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:13.960
at the end of Plato's
Symposium everybody is

00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:16.296
out,
except for Socrates who looks

00:27:16.296 --> 00:27:18.681
around and says,
"oh well no more conversation

00:27:18.681 --> 00:27:21.182
everybody's asleep."
Off he goes,

00:27:21.182 --> 00:27:26.009
and we know who won that one.
Why could they do that?

00:27:26.009 --> 00:27:31.317
Well, they weren't ignorant
undergraduates,

00:27:31.317 --> 00:27:35.240
but beyond that they drank
wine,

00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:38.501
not those barbarian liquids
that you drink,

00:27:38.501 --> 00:27:41.839
and also they mixed that wine
with water,

00:27:41.839 --> 00:27:44.960
so that it shouldn't get them
drunk too fast.

00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:49.220
Think about how the world has
decayed, since those days.

00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:54.237
So anyway, it still has its
alcoholic consequences,

00:27:54.237 --> 00:28:00.157
and I like to think that the
trick for these guys was to get

00:28:00.157 --> 00:28:05.876
to that level of inebriation
before it affects your nerves

00:28:05.876 --> 00:28:09.789
and your physical ability to
act.

00:28:09.789 --> 00:28:15.244
But it's worked on your brain
to the point where you get to

00:28:15.244 --> 00:28:19.853
that sort of what I like to
think of that bar room

00:28:19.853 --> 00:28:22.477
militancy,
whereby if a guy says,

00:28:22.477 --> 00:28:25.450
"would you pass the peanuts,"
you say, "oh yeah!"

00:28:31.619 --> 00:28:36.200
I'd like to think that's the
ideal hoplite mode.

00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:39.699
So, I think that's working on
them, they want to get at those

00:28:39.699 --> 00:28:42.790
SOBs on the other side,
and they want to kill them;

00:28:42.790 --> 00:28:46.379
that's their mood.
Well, all of that is working on

00:28:46.379 --> 00:28:48.664
both sides.
And so that when they come

00:28:48.664 --> 00:28:50.839
together, they come together in
a trot.

00:28:50.839 --> 00:28:53.825
You have to imagine they're
moving along quicker than you

00:28:53.825 --> 00:28:56.277
would by walking,
so that they will go bang and

00:28:56.277 --> 00:28:58.358
we can see what happens.
However,

00:28:58.358 --> 00:29:01.445
there's one other variable that
you want to be aware of and that

00:29:01.445 --> 00:29:04.440
is,
he knows he ought to be going

00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:09.188
straight ahead like that,
but he also knows that his

00:29:09.188 --> 00:29:12.951
right flank is open.
Well, he would love to be

00:29:12.951 --> 00:29:15.547
fighting at the edge of the
Grand Canyon,

00:29:15.547 --> 00:29:19.309
so that he doesn't have to
worry about his right flank,

00:29:19.309 --> 00:29:21.380
but he's out there in the
middle of a field.

00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:24.639
Now, he knows that first step
ought to be like this,

00:29:24.639 --> 00:29:28.089
but he's only human,
so the first step is like this,

00:29:28.089 --> 00:29:30.980
and so is the guy on the other
end on that side.

00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:33.064
So, in fact,
as Thucydides tells us

00:29:33.064 --> 00:29:36.129
beautifully in Book V,
when the two armies actually

00:29:36.129 --> 00:29:40.359
hit each other they have already
made a slight turn to the right.

00:29:40.359 --> 00:29:43.236
Everybody moves to the right,
these guys move to the right,

00:29:43.236 --> 00:29:46.163
those guys move to the right
and they're smacking each other

00:29:46.163 --> 00:29:50.940
at something like that angle.
Okay so much for that.

00:29:50.940 --> 00:29:56.199
Now, here we go.
I'm coming at this guy and what

00:29:56.199 --> 00:29:59.859
I want to do,
if I can, I want to kill him.

00:29:59.859 --> 00:30:04.597
If I can't, I want to knock him
back, because what I really need

00:30:04.597 --> 00:30:07.380
to do is to get him out of the
way.

00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:11.046
Let me imagine that I've been
lucky enough to get you out of

00:30:11.046 --> 00:30:14.402
the way--you're fighting him you
can't even look at me,

00:30:14.402 --> 00:30:15.770
but I can do that.

00:30:20.930 --> 00:30:22.967
But let's face it.
In order to kill you,

00:30:22.967 --> 00:30:25.509
I'd have to earn the privilege
by knocking him back.

00:30:25.509 --> 00:30:29.083
Now, let's imagine I've been
very lucky and gotten to

00:30:29.083 --> 00:30:33.177
you--just get down on your knee.
Imagine she's very badly

00:30:33.177 --> 00:30:35.960
wounded or dead,
but she's out of it.

00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:39.970
Now, here's where the ballgame
can really be determined.

00:30:39.970 --> 00:30:41.947
First of all,
let's consider the man behind

00:30:41.947 --> 00:30:44.880
you.
Is that you?

00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:48.162
Now, if you are standing there
with your--by the way the first

00:30:48.162 --> 00:30:50.799
three rows have a chance of
hitting each other.

00:30:50.799 --> 00:30:54.678
So, he's banging away over
somebody's head at the guy on

00:30:54.678 --> 00:30:57.780
the other side,
but you see this guy in front

00:30:57.780 --> 00:31:00.460
of you has just been knocked
down.

00:31:00.460 --> 00:31:04.591
The blood is spurting out of
her neck or her side or whatever

00:31:04.591 --> 00:31:07.690
and she's groaning down there on
the thing.

00:31:07.690 --> 00:31:08.620
What is your instinct?

00:31:13.650 --> 00:31:17.630
What's your instinct?
Tell me.

00:31:17.630 --> 00:31:21.306
Get out of here!
They just killed this guy in

00:31:21.306 --> 00:31:23.849
front of me and they're coming
after me.

00:31:23.849 --> 00:31:27.653
I always think of that
wonderful scene in--how many of

00:31:27.653 --> 00:31:30.190
you ever saw the Longest
Day?

00:31:30.190 --> 00:31:32.446
It is about D-Day;
there's a wonderful scene where

00:31:32.446 --> 00:31:35.534
this German officer comes down;
he's in charge of the defensive

00:31:35.534 --> 00:31:39.006
arrangements there at Normandy;
he's in a bunker,

00:31:39.006 --> 00:31:43.703
and he's reporting back to
headquarters and it's dark,

00:31:43.703 --> 00:31:48.754
and suddenly there's enough
light that he sees suddenly on

00:31:48.754 --> 00:31:53.539
the horizon is 5,000 ships,
the whole damn fleet.

00:31:53.539 --> 00:31:55.718
As he calls back and he says,
"they're coming,

00:31:55.718 --> 00:31:59.170
they're coming."
They say, "how many?"

00:31:59.170 --> 00:32:01.910
He says, "thousands of them."
They say, "in what direction?"

00:32:01.910 --> 00:32:04.350
He says, "auf mich zu direct."

00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:13.006
That's the way it looks to him.
So that's what his tendency is,

00:32:13.006 --> 00:32:16.919
but if he does that,
it's very bad news for his

00:32:16.919 --> 00:32:20.719
city.
What he has been trained to

00:32:20.719 --> 00:32:27.059
do, what he knows he needs to do
is to fight forward and somehow

00:32:27.059 --> 00:32:29.614
step over her,
step on her,

00:32:29.614 --> 00:32:32.710
do whatever he has to do to
fill this hole.

00:32:32.710 --> 00:32:36.360
He's got to come forward and
take the danger and take the

00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:39.929
blows and close the line.
Because if not--now,

00:32:39.929 --> 00:32:45.357
I am in the situation where the
guy next to me has beaten you

00:32:45.357 --> 00:32:48.616
up,
but I can now get her and I can

00:32:48.616 --> 00:32:52.208
step in here,
and the guy behind me can do

00:32:52.208 --> 00:32:55.631
the same,
and so we can create a wedge in

00:32:55.631 --> 00:33:00.450
which we are doing the killing
and they are doing the falling.

00:33:00.450 --> 00:33:05.344
If enough of that happens,
after awhile some sense of

00:33:05.344 --> 00:33:10.332
what's happening up front
quickly works its way to the

00:33:10.332 --> 00:33:12.900
back,
and there can be a moment,

00:33:12.900 --> 00:33:16.210
and there always is a moment in
a hoplite battle,

00:33:16.210 --> 00:33:21.320
where the guys in the back say,
"uh-oh we have lost this

00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:24.514
battle."
So, the guys in the back turn

00:33:24.514 --> 00:33:29.200
and run, which is the only thing
you can possibly do once you

00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:32.089
feel our phalanx is
broken.

00:33:32.089 --> 00:33:34.910
We can't stand against them
anymore and when you start

00:33:34.910 --> 00:33:38.264
running, the only thing the guys
who are left up front can do is

00:33:38.264 --> 00:33:42.588
run.
Now, think of what it's like to

00:33:42.588 --> 00:33:47.781
run with this in your hand.
Can you make much speed that

00:33:47.781 --> 00:33:51.019
way?
No, and speed is what you want.

00:33:51.019 --> 00:33:54.810
And so the big issue is--this
is what you must never do,

00:33:54.810 --> 00:33:58.601
but this is what you got to do
if your phalanx is

00:33:58.601 --> 00:34:02.305
broken.
You got to drop your shield and

00:34:02.305 --> 00:34:04.344
run.
Then I'm on the winning side,

00:34:04.344 --> 00:34:07.690
and what I want to do is kill
as many of these guys as I can.

00:34:07.690 --> 00:34:12.465
However, there's this great
question of how far do the

00:34:12.465 --> 00:34:15.710
Greeks pursue in a hoplite
battle?

00:34:15.710 --> 00:34:18.893
Thucydides has an interesting
passage in there,

00:34:18.893 --> 00:34:22.422
in which he says that the
Spartans win the Battle of

00:34:22.422 --> 00:34:26.574
Mantinea and Thucydides says
that the Spartans did not pursue

00:34:26.574 --> 00:34:29.502
the hoplite.
The Spartans never pursue their

00:34:29.502 --> 00:34:32.202
enemies very far.
It's as though he's explaining,

00:34:32.202 --> 00:34:34.980
giving an answer to a question
that somebody asked,

00:34:34.980 --> 00:34:37.980
"why didn't the Spartans do
better in that battle?"

00:34:37.980 --> 00:34:41.367
To which there could many
answers at the Battle of

00:34:41.367 --> 00:34:45.099
Mantinea, but it seems there's a
much easier answer.

00:34:45.099 --> 00:34:50.340
Basically, the Greeks couldn't
pursue very hotly with infantry.

00:34:50.340 --> 00:34:52.718
They don't want to throw their
shields away,

00:34:52.718 --> 00:34:55.593
they want to keep their
shields, so guys with shields

00:34:55.593 --> 00:34:57.639
are chasing guys without
shields.

00:34:57.639 --> 00:35:00.179
So, they're not going to chase
them very far.

00:35:00.179 --> 00:35:04.606
Now, another issue that
emerges in discussion of these

00:35:04.606 --> 00:35:07.480
kinds of battles is the
casualties.

00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:11.636
For a long, long time the
general wisdom was there were

00:35:11.636 --> 00:35:16.332
not heavy casualties in hoplite
battles--people calculating on

00:35:16.332 --> 00:35:21.293
what I was just talking about.
But then an old Yalie who took

00:35:21.293 --> 00:35:25.511
this course when he was very
young, and later became an

00:35:25.511 --> 00:35:30.250
ancient Greek historian,
took the wonderfully outlandish

00:35:30.250 --> 00:35:33.219
device of answering this
question.

00:35:33.219 --> 00:35:37.184
He simply took all the battles
in Greek history that we have a

00:35:37.184 --> 00:35:41.150
record of, and which we know
what the casualties were like,

00:35:41.150 --> 00:35:45.710
and counted and he
concluded--anybody can check

00:35:45.710 --> 00:35:51.559
because there they are--that
casualties could run as high as

00:35:51.559 --> 00:35:57.737
15% at a hoplite battle.
That's a high casualty rate and

00:35:57.737 --> 00:36:02.367
many a military unit will break
if they have that many

00:36:02.367 --> 00:36:06.777
casualties.
Actually, what he finds is the

00:36:06.777 --> 00:36:13.365
winning side would lose about 5%
and the losing side would lose

00:36:13.365 --> 00:36:18.360
maybe as much 15%,
and so you get some idea.

00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:21.810
But don't imagine that these
were anything like bloodless or

00:36:21.810 --> 00:36:23.870
easy.
They were bloody,

00:36:23.870 --> 00:36:28.239
although the actual amount
would vary with the

00:36:28.239 --> 00:36:32.460
circumstances.
Now, you know the battle is

00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:36.810
over in a variety of ways.
One, the enemy ran away;

00:36:36.810 --> 00:36:39.939
that's pretty good.
But for the Greeks it was very

00:36:39.939 --> 00:36:43.090
important that things should be
really official.

00:36:43.090 --> 00:36:47.702
There were, and there's a lot
of debate about what I'm going

00:36:47.702 --> 00:36:51.923
to say next, there were
protocols of fighting that were

00:36:51.923 --> 00:36:54.983
followed.
Some people want to have these

00:36:54.983 --> 00:36:57.844
to be many and for them to be
very binding,

00:36:57.844 --> 00:37:01.659
others want them to be very few
and not very binding,

00:37:01.659 --> 00:37:04.489
and that's an argument one can
get into.

00:37:04.489 --> 00:37:07.432
But some things seem to be
indisputable,

00:37:07.432 --> 00:37:10.525
for instance,
if I say we won the battle I

00:37:10.525 --> 00:37:13.770
can prove that to you most of
the time.

00:37:13.770 --> 00:37:17.619
Why?
Because I now occupy the land

00:37:17.619 --> 00:37:22.118
that we fought on.
Therefore, I can do what they

00:37:22.118 --> 00:37:23.399
did.
Take a stick,

00:37:23.399 --> 00:37:26.739
bang it into the ground,
hang on that stick a captured

00:37:26.739 --> 00:37:27.370
helmet,

00:37:33.059 --> 00:37:36.278
or a captured corselet,
something that represents the

00:37:36.278 --> 00:37:39.930
military equipment that the
losers had that were left on the

00:37:39.930 --> 00:37:41.440
field.
We hang it up;

00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:47.101
that is called a trophy.
The word trophy comes from the

00:37:47.101 --> 00:37:51.245
word that means to turn,
trepho,

00:37:51.245 --> 00:37:57.898
and it means that this is the
place where the enemy turned and

00:37:57.898 --> 00:38:00.639
ran.
We own that property now,

00:38:00.639 --> 00:38:03.946
we own their equipment,
and therefore we won the

00:38:03.946 --> 00:38:06.468
battle.
Another tangible way of

00:38:06.468 --> 00:38:09.634
understanding who won the battle
and who didn't,

00:38:09.634 --> 00:38:12.607
is we winners,
because we own the field,

00:38:12.607 --> 00:38:16.921
we can pick up the casualties,
take care of those who can be

00:38:16.921 --> 00:38:19.956
saved,
bury the ones who have been

00:38:19.956 --> 00:38:22.681
killed;
we don't have to ask anybody's

00:38:22.681 --> 00:38:26.539
permission.
Burial is very critical.

00:38:26.539 --> 00:38:30.217
If you remember from reading
the Iliad and

00:38:30.217 --> 00:38:33.512
Odyssey,
it is absolutely critical in

00:38:33.512 --> 00:38:37.650
the Greek religion that people
be properly buried,

00:38:37.650 --> 00:38:41.317
because if they're not,
then their shade goes on

00:38:41.317 --> 00:38:45.627
forever in misery and pain.
They cannot rest quietly in

00:38:45.627 --> 00:38:49.420
Hades unless their body has been
properly buried;

00:38:49.420 --> 00:38:54.493
so you got to do it.
The losing side must come to

00:38:54.493 --> 00:38:59.554
the winning side and they must
ask permission to pick up their

00:38:59.554 --> 00:39:03.369
dead and bury them.
Typically, that is granted and

00:39:03.369 --> 00:39:06.751
they can then do it,
but they are of course humbling

00:39:06.751 --> 00:39:10.995
themselves by making the request
and coming down under the orders

00:39:10.995 --> 00:39:15.239
of the winners and taking their
dead away and being buried.

00:39:15.239 --> 00:39:17.880
So it's very,
very clear who won and who lost

00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:21.480
and that's--I think it's a very
important point because Greek

00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:25.287
hoplite warfare,
which is the characteristic

00:39:25.287 --> 00:39:30.694
warfare of the Greeks from the
eighth century on into the

00:39:30.694 --> 00:39:34.084
fourth,
never loses its character as a

00:39:34.084 --> 00:39:37.721
kind of a game,
in which there are winners and

00:39:37.721 --> 00:39:40.551
losers,
and the winners are given the

00:39:40.551 --> 00:39:43.480
prize and the losers don't get
the prize.

00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:47.776
It's a contest just like
everything else in Greek society

00:39:47.776 --> 00:39:52.215
and there's a tremendous amount
of pride that goes into victory

00:39:52.215 --> 00:39:56.440
and a tremendous amount of shame
that goes into defeat.

00:39:56.440 --> 00:39:59.184
But we said the same thing
about the Homeric heroes,

00:39:59.184 --> 00:40:01.440
didn't we?
Here's the difference;

00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:05.570
they're not fighting for
themselves, they're not fighting

00:40:05.570 --> 00:40:09.430
for their families,
and only to limited extent are

00:40:09.430 --> 00:40:14.130
they fighting for their personal
glory, their kleios;

00:40:14.130 --> 00:40:19.438
they are fighting for their
city, and they will be honored

00:40:19.438 --> 00:40:23.630
by their city in victory or even
in defeat,

00:40:23.630 --> 00:40:27.646
if they perform very
heroically, and of course,

00:40:27.646 --> 00:40:31.140
what about if they were very
shameful?

00:40:31.140 --> 00:40:36.494
What about if they run away?
I think I want to save the

00:40:36.494 --> 00:40:40.090
illustration of that one until
we talk about Sparta.

00:40:40.090 --> 00:40:45.567
What Tyrtaeus tells us very,
very specifically how bad that

00:40:45.567 --> 00:40:47.679
is;
it's bad.

00:40:47.679 --> 00:40:52.870
So, you have this tremendous
continuity between the sort of

00:40:52.870 --> 00:40:58.150
the honor code that was so
dominant in the Homeric world,

00:40:58.150 --> 00:41:01.639
which has now been shifted to
the larger unit,

00:41:01.639 --> 00:41:06.158
which is the polis.
If you can see it,

00:41:06.158 --> 00:41:09.970
all adult males fought.
I should back up;

00:41:09.970 --> 00:41:13.463
that's not quite true.
There's an important point I

00:41:13.463 --> 00:41:16.635
didn't make.
Not everybody gets to fight in

00:41:16.635 --> 00:41:20.209
the hoplite phalanx.
The town, the city,

00:41:20.209 --> 00:41:24.510
the polis does not
provide the fighters with their

00:41:24.510 --> 00:41:27.493
defensive armor.
They might sometime give them

00:41:27.493 --> 00:41:29.909
their weapons,
but not their defensive armor.

00:41:29.909 --> 00:41:32.997
You can't fight as a hoplite,
in other words,

00:41:32.997 --> 00:41:36.856
unless you can afford to pay
for your equipment and that

00:41:36.856 --> 00:41:40.715
excludes a goodly number of
citizens who are too poor to

00:41:40.715 --> 00:41:44.248
fight in the phalanx.
This becomes a very,

00:41:44.248 --> 00:41:48.919
very large issue because the
notion that there should be a

00:41:48.919 --> 00:41:53.179
real connection between
citizenship in the full sense

00:41:53.179 --> 00:41:58.260
and military performance is
totally a Greek idea--I mean,

00:41:58.260 --> 00:42:01.210
the Greeks just totally accept
that idea.

00:42:01.210 --> 00:42:04.560
Actually, later on at the end
of the fourth century when

00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:07.179
Aristotle is writing his
Politics,

00:42:07.179 --> 00:42:10.712
he makes really a very clear
connection as to the style of

00:42:10.712 --> 00:42:14.059
fighting and the kind of
constitution that you have.

00:42:14.059 --> 00:42:18.603
He said very clearly,
if you use cavalry as your

00:42:18.603 --> 00:42:22.789
major arm, your state will be an
aristocracy.

00:42:22.789 --> 00:42:26.887
If you use hoplites,
your state will be,

00:42:26.887 --> 00:42:32.349
what he calls a politea,
a moderate regime.

00:42:32.349 --> 00:42:37.379
If you use a navy,
your state will be a democracy

00:42:37.379 --> 00:42:41.780
in which the lower classes are
dominant.

00:42:41.780 --> 00:42:44.292
So, there's this real
connection and that's the way

00:42:44.292 --> 00:42:47.567
they really thought about it.
So, what we will see as the

00:42:47.567 --> 00:42:51.001
polis is invented,
moving away from aristocratic

00:42:51.001 --> 00:42:54.053
rule in the pre-polis
days or in the early

00:42:54.053 --> 00:42:58.060
polis days--you will see
a middling group of citizens who

00:42:58.060 --> 00:42:59.917
are,
according to this

00:42:59.917 --> 00:43:02.914
interpretation,
Hanson's farmers who are also

00:43:02.914 --> 00:43:06.796
going to gain the political
capacity to participate in the

00:43:06.796 --> 00:43:11.138
town councils,
and who are the hoplites but it

00:43:11.138 --> 00:43:15.956
will exclude the poor,
who will not have political

00:43:15.956 --> 00:43:18.266
rights.
Most Greek states,

00:43:18.266 --> 00:43:22.909
just as they never moved beyond
the hoplite style of fighting,

00:43:22.909 --> 00:43:27.010
never go beyond the
oligarchical style of

00:43:27.010 --> 00:43:33.264
constitution which gives only
hoplites political rights in the

00:43:33.264 --> 00:43:36.208
state.
Okay, stay there because who

00:43:36.208 --> 00:43:40.320
knows, there are 20 million
other things I might have said,

00:43:40.320 --> 00:43:43.912
but instead let me give you the
opportunity to ask questions

00:43:43.912 --> 00:43:47.244
that you would like to raise,
particularly if you want to ask

00:43:47.244 --> 00:43:49.201
about how they fought,
as long as we have a

00:43:49.201 --> 00:43:52.090
phalanx here we might as
well use it if we need too.

00:43:52.090 --> 00:43:56.394
Are there any questions?
Yeah?Student: How

00:43:56.394 --> 00:43:58.425
would they practice because
weren't they prominently

00:43:58.425 --> 00:44:00.814
farmers?Professor Donald
Kagan: The answer is they

00:44:00.814 --> 00:44:04.203
damn near didn't.
That is, you've got a very key

00:44:04.203 --> 00:44:06.567
point;
there was very little military

00:44:06.567 --> 00:44:08.137
training.
On the other hand,

00:44:08.137 --> 00:44:10.974
you don't need very much.
Think about it,

00:44:10.974 --> 00:44:14.920
what are the skills?
What are the technicalities?

00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:21.230
If I'm the general and so I
say--what do I say?

00:44:21.230 --> 00:44:25.923
Charge!
Now we're engaging each other,

00:44:25.923 --> 00:44:30.019
what do I say?
Fight harder men!

00:44:30.019 --> 00:44:34.800
Now we're in trouble and I say,
don't run away!

00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:38.147
There are no techniques,
there are no maneuvers,

00:44:38.147 --> 00:44:41.921
there are no--you can't do
anything and so they didn't

00:44:41.921 --> 00:44:46.675
practice very much,
except one stunning exception,

00:44:46.675 --> 00:44:50.239
the Spartans.
They were not farmers as we

00:44:50.239 --> 00:44:53.911
shall see, and therefore,
they spent their lives

00:44:53.911 --> 00:44:56.720
practicing warfare.
It paid off;

00:44:56.720 --> 00:44:59.843
they usually won.
So, the answer is basically

00:44:59.843 --> 00:45:03.059
that the ordinary Greeks did not
engage in very much

00:45:03.059 --> 00:45:06.781
practice.Student: If
they're all fighting in this

00:45:06.781 --> 00:45:09.647
hoplite style,
how do all of these great Greek

00:45:09.647 --> 00:45:12.550
military personas develop,
who are famed for being such

00:45:12.550 --> 00:45:14.735
wonderful,
individual soldiers,

00:45:14.735 --> 00:45:17.038
if there's no real
hand-to-hand,

00:45:17.038 --> 00:45:21.050
one-on-one?Professor
Donald Kagan: Well,

00:45:21.050 --> 00:45:23.820
there is nobody out there that
you could see.

00:45:23.820 --> 00:45:26.190
Typically, we don't have guys
like that.

00:45:26.190 --> 00:45:29.540
The guys who are famous are the
generals who get credit for

00:45:29.540 --> 00:45:32.428
putting together a nice
formation when it's not the

00:45:32.428 --> 00:45:37.517
simple one I've just given you.
Just to be a little bit more

00:45:37.517 --> 00:45:40.631
plain about that.
In the famous battle of

00:45:40.631 --> 00:45:43.460
Marathon, which I will tell you
about when we get there,

00:45:43.460 --> 00:45:47.670
one of its features is that
because the Greeks were

00:45:47.670 --> 00:45:51.460
numerically badly inferior to
the Persians,

00:45:51.460 --> 00:45:53.429
they had this problem of
covering the line.

00:45:53.429 --> 00:45:56.796
So, they could have thinned out
their entire phalanx,

00:45:56.796 --> 00:45:59.935
but that would have given the
Persians a chance to break

00:45:59.935 --> 00:46:06.582
through anywhere and everywhere,
and so what Miltiades did was

00:46:06.582 --> 00:46:14.975
to make his wings heavier,
deeper and very dangerously

00:46:14.975 --> 00:46:19.880
thin in the middle.
It was a gamble.

00:46:19.880 --> 00:46:25.251
The gamble was our wings will
crush their wings and turn in on

00:46:25.251 --> 00:46:28.510
them from behind and from the
side,

00:46:28.510 --> 00:46:33.559
and set them a running before
they break through our middle.

00:46:33.559 --> 00:46:40.739
As Wellington said at Waterloo,
it was a damn near thing.

00:46:40.739 --> 00:46:45.751
The Persians broke through the
middle but just before that,

00:46:45.751 --> 00:46:50.590
the Athenian wings crushed the
Persian wings and set them

00:46:50.590 --> 00:46:54.898
running for their ships.
So, everybody says what a

00:46:54.898 --> 00:47:00.366
genius Miltiades was.
Similarly, in naval battles

00:47:00.366 --> 00:47:08.120
Themistocles at Salamis comes up
with a clever device.

00:47:08.120 --> 00:47:10.539
So, you see what I'm driving at;
we know those guys.

00:47:10.539 --> 00:47:14.847
You never really hear of Joe
Blow who killed thirty-four guys

00:47:14.847 --> 00:47:18.451
in the phalanx.
There must have been some guys

00:47:18.451 --> 00:47:21.900
like that but you just don't
hear about those fellows.

00:47:21.900 --> 00:47:24.406
Any other questions?
Yeah.Student: When

00:47:24.406 --> 00:47:26.048
do they just pull out their
swords and start

00:47:26.048 --> 00:47:28.262
hacking?Professor Donald
Kagan: When they had no

00:47:28.262 --> 00:47:30.140
spear.Student: So,
the spears

00:47:30.140 --> 00:47:32.754
broke?Professor Donald
Kagan: Yeah,

00:47:32.754 --> 00:47:35.889
they would--these spears must
have broken like mad.

00:47:35.889 --> 00:47:38.750
And so the thing to do,
unless you have something else,

00:47:38.750 --> 00:47:41.451
you would go for your
sword.Student: It's

00:47:41.451 --> 00:47:44.523
not like you go out and you
start fighting people with just

00:47:44.523 --> 00:47:46.960
your body shield and you're
happy there.

00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:49.050
Professor Donald Kagan:
Always, oh yes always.

00:47:49.050 --> 00:47:52.258
You never, according to my
understanding of this,

00:47:52.258 --> 00:47:55.599
you never, never want to be
without your shield.

00:47:55.599 --> 00:47:57.951
That means, you never want to
be away from your

00:47:57.951 --> 00:48:00.869
phalanx.
This is disputed.

00:48:00.869 --> 00:48:05.022
This is exactly--these are the
grounds on which this new

00:48:05.022 --> 00:48:09.250
school--one of the ways in which
they argue otherwise.

00:48:09.250 --> 00:48:12.234
I'll say a little bit about
that, when I get through with

00:48:12.234 --> 00:48:13.538
phalanx.
I just want

00:48:13.538 --> 00:48:15.460
to--yeah.Student:
What about projectiles?

00:48:15.460 --> 00:48:17.652
Professor Donald
Kagan: These guys don't have

00:48:17.652 --> 00:48:20.295
any projectiles.
However, there are light arm

00:48:20.295 --> 00:48:24.559
troops made up of those two poor
to be in the phalanx,

00:48:24.559 --> 00:48:31.709
who do use projectiles and the
projectiles are arrows,

00:48:31.709 --> 00:48:36.969
javelins, or stones thrown by
slings.

00:48:36.969 --> 00:48:40.890
The trouble with them is none
of them has any range.

00:48:40.890 --> 00:48:46.069
Think about that for a moment.
Get out of your mind Henry V,

00:48:46.069 --> 00:48:51.307
forget the Battle of Agincourt.
They don't have--those men in

00:48:51.307 --> 00:48:56.423
Lincoln green with the enormous
long bows, made out of good

00:48:56.423 --> 00:49:01.244
English composite whatever,
who can fire the thing

00:49:01.244 --> 00:49:07.469
thousands of yards and penetrate
and kill the French nobility.

00:49:07.469 --> 00:49:12.533
How many of you have seen Henry
V in the Laurence Olivier

00:49:12.533 --> 00:49:15.479
version 1945?
They got this miserable modern

00:49:15.479 --> 00:49:18.551
one with the sort of Vietnam
like conditions that they have

00:49:18.551 --> 00:49:21.064
out there;
it's raining all through the

00:49:21.064 --> 00:49:23.988
God-damned battle of Agincourt.
Great battle,

00:49:23.988 --> 00:49:27.407
it's got to have sunshine,
blue skies, terrific--well,

00:49:27.407 --> 00:49:32.159
never mind.
They had very poor bows and

00:49:32.159 --> 00:49:34.955
arrows.
They didn't have the composite

00:49:34.955 --> 00:49:37.887
bow, didn't have power.
It would have had a hard time

00:49:37.887 --> 00:49:41.269
getting through the shields and
it didn't have any distance.

00:49:41.269 --> 00:49:44.110
But they were worth something
because they did this.

00:49:44.110 --> 00:49:47.944
Actually, those guys would be
useful, not so much,

00:49:47.944 --> 00:49:51.466
hardly at all during the scrum
of the phalanx,

00:49:51.466 --> 00:49:54.440
but should one side be
retreating.

00:49:54.440 --> 00:49:58.237
That's where they do it harm.
Once you throw your shield away

00:49:58.237 --> 00:50:00.477
and you're running,
anybody who's got a weapon can

00:50:00.477 --> 00:50:02.260
take you out,
and that's what would have

00:50:02.260 --> 00:50:03.784
happened.
Yeah?Student: So,

00:50:03.784 --> 00:50:05.584
is it unlikely that someone
like the fellow that was named

00:50:05.584 --> 00:50:06.995
begin with M.
that we read about from the

00:50:06.995 --> 00:50:08.940
selection.Professor
Donald Kagan: Do you mean,

00:50:08.940 --> 00:50:10.799
Miltiades?Student:
No, the archer in the

00:50:10.799 --> 00:50:12.770
Iliad.Professor
Donald Kagan: Oh,

00:50:12.770 --> 00:50:14.574
in the Iliad.
Student: Is it

00:50:14.574 --> 00:50:16.279
unlikely that people would
actually have been able to do

00:50:16.279 --> 00:50:17.550
anything like
that?Professor Donald

00:50:17.550 --> 00:50:20.081
Kagan: Yes,
of course, the Iliad has

00:50:20.081 --> 00:50:23.718
various people who are very good
archers, who could kill the

00:50:23.718 --> 00:50:27.033
other guy.
I'm sure there were bows and

00:50:27.033 --> 00:50:31.431
arrows at that time,
but they did not yet have the

00:50:31.431 --> 00:50:36.010
kind of armor that they would
have in this time.

00:50:36.010 --> 00:50:38.999
So, they would have been more
vulnerable and you wouldn't have

00:50:38.999 --> 00:50:42.067
to have such a powerful bow.
Of course Paris,

00:50:42.067 --> 00:50:46.460
isn't he the one who kills
Achilles, right?

00:50:46.460 --> 00:50:48.909
But Achilles,
of course, he got him in the

00:50:48.909 --> 00:50:51.180
heel where he didn't have any
armor.

00:50:51.180 --> 00:50:54.426
Anything else?
Yeah?Student: I

00:50:54.426 --> 00:50:58.138
mean, isn't it somewhat
inefficient to load it really

00:50:58.138 --> 00:50:59.679
deep,
because I assume if a spear is

00:50:59.679 --> 00:51:01.166
only six feet long,
what are people in the back

00:51:01.166 --> 00:51:02.460
going to be
doing?Professor Donald

00:51:02.460 --> 00:51:04.784
Kagan: Very good yes,
and that's a big argument that

00:51:04.784 --> 00:51:08.705
nobody has a good answer for.
The traditional answer is that

00:51:08.705 --> 00:51:13.836
these guys actually did press up
against the rows in front of

00:51:13.836 --> 00:51:18.711
them and that this provided a
momentum that gave the front

00:51:18.711 --> 00:51:23.500
line an advantage in beating the
enemy facing them.

00:51:23.500 --> 00:51:24.650
You can see all kinds of
troubles.

00:51:24.650 --> 00:51:26.809
Why didn't the guys in the
middle get crushed?

00:51:26.809 --> 00:51:31.469
I don't have any very good
answers for that and yet it is

00:51:31.469 --> 00:51:35.630
one part of the traditional
explanation is this,

00:51:35.630 --> 00:51:38.976
and it's a very important one
and much debated,

00:51:38.976 --> 00:51:43.268
that at a critical time in the
battle one technique would be

00:51:43.268 --> 00:51:46.469
one side would give one great
big shove.

00:51:46.469 --> 00:51:49.394
The word in Greek is
othismos,

00:51:49.394 --> 00:51:52.969
and if that was successful as
it might be,

00:51:52.969 --> 00:51:56.831
it could knock down the lines
of the front guys and get the

00:51:56.831 --> 00:51:59.552
other side running.
There's ancient evidence,

00:51:59.552 --> 00:52:02.515
there's an ancient source for
that, that says that's what

00:52:02.515 --> 00:52:05.530
happened and that's one of the
things that we have to deal

00:52:05.530 --> 00:52:07.516
with.
The critics of this point of

00:52:07.516 --> 00:52:10.219
view would say that's impossible
and inconceivable.

00:52:10.219 --> 00:52:13.768
Another possible
explanation of the significance

00:52:13.768 --> 00:52:16.969
of depth is, remember,
our poor victim here.

00:52:16.969 --> 00:52:21.436
If you multiply her,
then you want to have as much

00:52:21.436 --> 00:52:26.539
depth to fill in behind to close
that hole as you can,

00:52:26.539 --> 00:52:30.200
so that that would make your
phalanx more sturdy,

00:52:30.200 --> 00:52:34.060
because you could take more
casualties without breaking,

00:52:34.060 --> 00:52:39.012
that seems reasonable to me.
But again, I can't imagine how

00:52:39.012 --> 00:52:41.900
these guys fought in these
circumstances.

00:52:41.900 --> 00:52:46.503
I really can't see it.
I mean, it's a pity we can't

00:52:46.503 --> 00:52:50.991
kill people in experiments
deliberately anymore,

00:52:50.991 --> 00:52:56.719
because we need to see how this
works, but I can't do it.

00:52:56.719 --> 00:53:00.079
But I do think that that makes
a reasonable amount of sense.

00:53:00.079 --> 00:53:02.389
Anything else on the mechanics
of our phalanx?

00:53:02.389 --> 00:53:06.216
Yes?Student: How did
they determine when two armies

00:53:06.216 --> 00:53:09.101
would charge each
other?Professor Donald

00:53:09.101 --> 00:53:14.599
Kagan: To charge each other,
is that what you're saying?

00:53:14.599 --> 00:53:21.168
Well, what happens is one army
is invading the land of the

00:53:21.168 --> 00:53:23.358
other.
So, it's--In a way,

00:53:23.358 --> 00:53:27.229
it decided when the fighting is
going to take place up to a

00:53:27.229 --> 00:53:29.429
point.
Namely, it's going to happen

00:53:29.429 --> 00:53:32.687
this summer, because we're
coming and it's going to happen

00:53:32.687 --> 00:53:35.620
this week;
it's going to happen tomorrow,

00:53:35.620 --> 00:53:39.606
if you don't run away.
So, now, the defenders have to

00:53:39.606 --> 00:53:43.990
do it, in a perfect situation,
I am marching towards their

00:53:43.990 --> 00:53:47.297
corn crop,
grain crop, at the time just

00:53:47.297 --> 00:53:50.840
before the grain is going to be
harvested.

00:53:50.840 --> 00:53:54.699
If we cut down that grain you
don't eat this winter.

00:53:54.699 --> 00:53:58.349
You get in front of the grain,
when we say.

00:53:58.349 --> 00:54:02.050
So, that would be the classic
way of determining how it works.

00:54:02.050 --> 00:54:05.515
It's never--it probably wasn't
quite that easy but the invading

00:54:05.515 --> 00:54:08.981
side goes for something that the
other side will have to defend

00:54:08.981 --> 00:54:12.000
and that determines when the
fighting takes place.

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:16.167
Yes sir?Student: How
long would most of these battles

00:54:16.167 --> 00:54:19.739
last?Professor Donald
Kagan: Hard to say.

00:54:19.739 --> 00:54:26.784
Hard to imagine anybody doing
this for more than a couple of

00:54:26.784 --> 00:54:29.525
hours.
So that would be my guess,

00:54:29.525 --> 00:54:33.167
but nobody knows for sure.
But I think if you can imagine,

00:54:33.167 --> 00:54:35.820
up to a couple of hours would
be about right.

00:54:35.820 --> 00:54:39.280
That's worth mentioning,
how long is a war?

00:54:39.280 --> 00:54:42.545
A couple of hours,
because typically there's just

00:54:42.545 --> 00:54:45.363
one battle;
one side beats the other and

00:54:45.363 --> 00:54:47.705
that's the war for now.
Until we get,

00:54:47.705 --> 00:54:50.289
of course, this is early days,
until we get to the

00:54:50.289 --> 00:54:53.454
Peloponnesian War when things
change radically in fighting in

00:54:53.454 --> 00:54:55.309
general,
but this is your standard.

00:54:55.309 --> 00:54:58.557
Yes sir?Student: You
had mentioned that the losing

00:54:58.557 --> 00:55:00.992
side casualty numbers were
approximately about

00:55:00.992 --> 00:55:03.590
15%?Professor Donald
Kagan: Yeah,

00:55:03.590 --> 00:55:04.993
it could be that
bad.Student: If

00:55:04.993 --> 00:55:06.429
you're fighting for an hour or
two hours,

00:55:06.429 --> 00:55:08.045
it just seems like that would
be such a low

00:55:08.045 --> 00:55:09.929
number.Professor Donald
Kagan: Well,

00:55:09.929 --> 00:55:13.047
you got to realize that much of
the time, until the

00:55:13.047 --> 00:55:16.165
phalanx breaks,
there's not a lot of killing

00:55:16.165 --> 00:55:18.999
that can go on.
You can only kill just a few

00:55:18.999 --> 00:55:22.180
people while they're still
defending themselves in this

00:55:22.180 --> 00:55:25.379
manner.
I have to believe that the bulk

00:55:25.379 --> 00:55:30.515
of the killing took place on the
flight and so that's why that

00:55:30.515 --> 00:55:33.663
works out.
Student: What do you

00:55:33.663 --> 00:55:36.416
do the rest of the time?
Just push?Professor

00:55:36.416 --> 00:55:38.820
Donald Kagan: If you're not
hitting, you're pushing,

00:55:38.820 --> 00:55:40.761
that's the
theory.Student: An

00:55:40.761 --> 00:55:43.199
hour?Professor Donald
Kagan: Or two.

00:55:43.199 --> 00:55:46.128
Yes?Student: How do
they decide who went in front

00:55:46.128 --> 00:55:48.461
and who went in the
back?Professor Donald

00:55:48.461 --> 00:55:50.050
Kagan: No,
that's right.

00:55:50.050 --> 00:55:54.047
They would have decided on the
basis of what was most effective

00:55:54.047 --> 00:55:57.969
and you would not want old guys.
By the way, how old are the

00:55:57.969 --> 00:56:00.340
people out there is a good
question.

00:56:00.340 --> 00:56:06.902
Typically, the youngest guys
are twenty, and typically the

00:56:06.902 --> 00:56:11.558
oldest guys are 45,
but everybody was liable to

00:56:11.558 --> 00:56:16.449
military service in these states
until they were about 60.

00:56:16.449 --> 00:56:20.331
So, you can imagine in certain
circumstances there would be

00:56:20.331 --> 00:56:24.012
guys that old back there,
but fundamentally it's between

00:56:24.012 --> 00:56:27.365
20 and 45.
Okay, I would have thought that

00:56:27.365 --> 00:56:30.950
the front row would exclude the
older people.

00:56:30.950 --> 00:56:34.728
You want tough guys up front;
you don't want your front line

00:56:34.728 --> 00:56:37.208
being broken.
So, the guys up front are

00:56:37.208 --> 00:56:40.877
going--the younger you are,
chances are you're going to be

00:56:40.877 --> 00:56:43.579
more physically strong than
older guys.

00:56:43.579 --> 00:56:46.045
Probably, though,
you wouldn't want to have the

00:56:46.045 --> 00:56:49.155
very youngest guys up front,
because another thing you want

00:56:49.155 --> 00:56:52.078
is experience.
People who have seen this

00:56:52.078 --> 00:56:55.211
before, done it before,
lived through it,

00:56:55.211 --> 00:56:59.050
and now you can count on them
not to run away,

00:56:59.050 --> 00:57:02.069
better than you can on a fresh
recruit who's never done this

00:57:02.069 --> 00:57:04.472
before.
So, I would have thought--so

00:57:04.472 --> 00:57:07.456
you see I'm speculating to a
certain degree,

00:57:07.456 --> 00:57:11.550
but I would have thought you
would have guys 25 to 35 in the

00:57:11.550 --> 00:57:15.395
front couple or three lines,
and then behind them younger

00:57:15.395 --> 00:57:18.230
men and then maybe the older men
at the very back,

00:57:18.230 --> 00:57:21.766
or maybe because you wanted to
be sure that that last row

00:57:21.766 --> 00:57:24.039
didn't turn and run away too
fast,

00:57:24.039 --> 00:57:27.728
you might have some who were
not quite so old at the very

00:57:27.728 --> 00:57:31.679
back, but it's all a question of
what's effective and why;

00:57:31.679 --> 00:57:32.920
that would be my thinking about
that.

00:57:32.920 --> 00:57:36.868
Yes?Student:
[Inaudible]Professor

00:57:36.868 --> 00:57:40.079
Donald Kagan: In what?
Normally.

00:57:40.079 --> 00:57:42.429
I say that a typical
phalanx is eight;

00:57:42.429 --> 00:57:46.144
however, by the time you get
down to the fourth century and

00:57:46.144 --> 00:57:49.860
people are doing all kinds of
new and innovative things,

00:57:49.860 --> 00:57:56.124
we hear that the left wing of
the Boeotian army at Leuktra was

00:57:56.124 --> 00:58:00.262
fifty men deep.
Now, what are you going to do

00:58:00.262 --> 00:58:03.230
with that?
But it's clearly a fact.

00:58:03.230 --> 00:58:07.292
There were previous examples of
people trying to have a deep

00:58:07.292 --> 00:58:11.770
wing that would do things,
but if you take me back to my

00:58:11.770 --> 00:58:17.047
primitive phalanx here
about 600-650 they're not doing

00:58:17.047 --> 00:58:20.583
that stuff yet.
But I think that depth would

00:58:20.583 --> 00:58:24.840
have been determined by how many
soldiers you had available.

00:58:24.840 --> 00:58:29.195
You would have made your
phalanx as deep as you

00:58:29.195 --> 00:58:33.139
could, and once you had the
width established.

00:58:33.139 --> 00:58:37.537
Yeah?Student: Would
the winner of the war slaughter

00:58:37.537 --> 00:58:41.502
the enemy that would fall behind
or would they give them

00:58:41.502 --> 00:58:45.827
back?Professor Donald
Kagan: The question is would

00:58:45.827 --> 00:58:49.648
the defeated army--would the
winning army kill all the

00:58:49.648 --> 00:58:54.550
defeated guys who were still on
the battlefield at the time?

00:58:54.550 --> 00:58:57.030
It would vary.
They could capture them.

00:58:57.030 --> 00:58:59.230
There's a reason to capture
them.

00:58:59.230 --> 00:59:02.409
You could demand ransom for
them.

00:59:02.409 --> 00:59:05.614
So, there would be some
inclination to capture men

00:59:05.614 --> 00:59:08.706
rather than to kill them.
On the other hand,

00:59:08.706 --> 00:59:12.464
guys who were engaged in a
fight of the kind we must

00:59:12.464 --> 00:59:16.345
imagine get very angry;
these guys killed a buddy next

00:59:16.345 --> 00:59:18.456
to you.
So, there would have been a

00:59:18.456 --> 00:59:21.218
certain amount of just furious
killing going on,

00:59:21.218 --> 00:59:24.567
but I don't think that would
have been the way you planned

00:59:24.567 --> 00:59:27.379
the game.
You kill enough guys to achieve

00:59:27.379 --> 00:59:30.909
your goal and if you're still
rational you take the rest

00:59:30.909 --> 00:59:33.920
prisoner.
I think would be the way to go.

00:59:33.920 --> 00:59:38.231
Yes?Student: What
would stop an opposing army from

00:59:38.231 --> 00:59:41.249
flanking you?Professor
Donald Kagan:

00:59:41.249 --> 00:59:45.417
What would stop it would
be--why didn't they flank each

00:59:45.417 --> 00:59:48.699
other?
Boy, if they could, they would.

00:59:48.699 --> 00:59:52.395
But the difficulty is,
if you take your left flank and

00:59:52.395 --> 00:59:55.323
move it out here so you can
flank this guy,

00:59:55.323 --> 00:59:58.739
one of two things has to happen
to your army.

00:59:58.739 --> 01:00:02.074
Either you open a nice hole
between yourself and the rest of

01:00:02.074 --> 01:00:05.012
your army, in which case
somebody's going to get very

01:00:05.012 --> 01:00:08.460
badly killed and you're going to
be on the run very soon,

01:00:08.460 --> 01:00:11.117
or you have to somehow
communicate to the rest of the

01:00:11.117 --> 01:00:13.110
army, "everybody come over this
way,"

01:00:13.110 --> 01:00:17.099
which will still leave that
flank open to being flanked by

01:00:17.099 --> 01:00:20.090
the other side.
That's what prevents that from

01:00:20.090 --> 01:00:22.730
happening, we just don't see
that going on.

01:00:22.730 --> 01:00:26.374
Yeah?Student: Was it
just the Greek sense of honor

01:00:26.374 --> 01:00:29.896
and propriety that kept them
from doing more creative sneak

01:00:29.896 --> 01:00:33.662
attack?Professor Donald
Kagan: It used to be thought

01:00:33.662 --> 01:00:36.820
before people were very
careful--we know that they do

01:00:36.820 --> 01:00:40.889
every terrible thing in the
world in the Peloponnesian War.

01:00:40.889 --> 01:00:44.238
Whatever the rules were before,
they're off when we get into

01:00:44.238 --> 01:00:47.177
the Peloponnesian War.
There's just no dirty trick

01:00:47.177 --> 01:00:49.280
that anybody fails to do if it
can.

01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:54.019
But they surely must have done
it before too.

01:00:54.019 --> 01:00:57.794
When you're serious,
any way to win will do,

01:00:57.794 --> 01:01:02.360
but mostly you could make a
virtue of a necessity.

01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:04.673
The kind of battle I've been
describing to you,

01:01:04.673 --> 01:01:06.836
a nice flat field,
two armies coming at each

01:01:06.836 --> 01:01:08.918
other,
there's not much you can do in

01:01:08.918 --> 01:01:11.601
the way of trickery,
and so you can take a high tone

01:01:11.601 --> 01:01:13.944
and say,
anybody who fights any other

01:01:13.944 --> 01:01:17.690
way is a no good coward.
In fact, we have some claim,

01:01:17.690 --> 01:01:22.264
and a Roman writer later on,
that there was a treaty back in

01:01:22.264 --> 01:01:27.336
the eighth century B.C.
between a couple of states in

01:01:27.336 --> 01:01:33.553
Euboea, that said they would
never use missiles of any kind,

01:01:33.553 --> 01:01:38.839
because that was cowardly.
The only legitimate fighting is

01:01:38.839 --> 01:01:41.573
man against man,
shield against shield,

01:01:41.573 --> 01:01:45.170
chest against chest,
everybody else is a pussy.

01:01:45.170 --> 01:01:50.926
So, I think that became--and
whatever the reality was,

01:01:50.926 --> 01:01:57.117
that story was always being
told, that's the way for a man

01:01:57.117 --> 01:02:01.394
to fight;
anything other than that is

01:02:01.394 --> 01:02:05.324
open to suspicion.
Okay, thank you very much

01:02:05.324 --> 01:02:07.810
hoplites.
A little hand for the hoplites.

01:02:17.180 --> 01:02:19.970
Just a few more little details.

01:02:25.230 --> 01:02:26.984
The situation begins
at--remember,

01:02:26.984 --> 01:02:29.641
the two sides are opposite each
other in the field,

01:02:29.641 --> 01:02:33.578
probably in the morning.
Each side conducts sacrifices

01:02:33.578 --> 01:02:38.389
in which they ask the gods for
assistance in the battle,

01:02:38.389 --> 01:02:42.464
sometimes they hope that there
will be a favorable omen

01:02:42.464 --> 01:02:46.849
suggesting they're going to win.
They have breakfast,

01:02:46.849 --> 01:02:51.763
they drink, and they advance
typically to a battle song

01:02:51.763 --> 01:02:56.949
called the paeon which we
have, what they sang.

01:02:56.949 --> 01:03:02.460
I don't have the tune but I
have the words.

01:03:02.460 --> 01:03:04.720
Does that sound like a good
thing to march into battle?

01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:09.710
Sounds good to me, I like that.
Then would come the battle.

01:03:09.710 --> 01:03:13.239
I talked to you about the
pursuit, the aftermath.

01:03:13.239 --> 01:03:16.670
There's just one more thing you
need to know about this

01:03:16.670 --> 01:03:23.020
phalanx mode of fighting.
When the phalanx fought

01:03:23.020 --> 01:03:30.562
against any other infantry
formation the phalanx

01:03:30.562 --> 01:03:34.128
wins;
from the time we first hear of

01:03:34.128 --> 01:03:38.290
Greeks fighting non-Greeks,
when the Greeks have the

01:03:38.290 --> 01:03:42.383
phalanx,
I think I'm right in saying

01:03:42.383 --> 01:03:47.172
they never lose a battle.
Finally they do in the,

01:03:47.172 --> 01:03:51.947
I think it's the second century
B.C., when King Phillip of

01:03:51.947 --> 01:03:56.639
Macedon has his phalanx
fighting against the Roman

01:03:56.639 --> 01:04:00.459
legion and the legion wins,
but believe me,

01:04:00.459 --> 01:04:04.560
it was no easy thing for the
legion to win even in that

01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:08.421
battle.
There was nothing automatic

01:04:08.421 --> 01:04:12.215
about that.
So great was the military

01:04:12.215 --> 01:04:18.013
success of the phalanx
that the King of Persia who was

01:04:18.013 --> 01:04:23.328
always getting into wars and
hiring troops--whenever the

01:04:23.328 --> 01:04:28.740
kings could they hired Greek
hoplites to fight for

01:04:28.740 --> 01:04:32.018
them.
When prince Cyrus seeks to

01:04:32.018 --> 01:04:36.663
overthrow his brother right
after the Peloponnesian War he

01:04:36.663 --> 01:04:41.308
signs up 10,000 veterans of the
Peloponnesian War from the

01:04:41.308 --> 01:04:44.405
Peloponnesus,
because with 10,000 Greek

01:04:44.405 --> 01:04:49.213
hoplites, he believes that he
can conquer the Persian Empire

01:04:49.213 --> 01:04:53.608
and make himself king,
even though the numbers are

01:04:53.608 --> 01:04:56.246
fabulous.
And those Greeks marched 1,500

01:04:56.246 --> 01:04:59.037
miles into the center of the
Persian Empire,

01:04:59.037 --> 01:05:02.544
down into Babylonia,
fight the army of the Persian

01:05:02.544 --> 01:05:05.392
king, defeat the army of the
Persian king,

01:05:05.392 --> 01:05:09.143
but unfortunately the prince
who led them down there is

01:05:09.143 --> 01:05:12.326
killed in the battle,
making the victory rather

01:05:12.326 --> 01:05:15.409
pointless, because the whole
idea was to make him king.

01:05:15.409 --> 01:05:20.296
So then you have Xenophon
writing his Anabasis,

01:05:20.296 --> 01:05:24.445
The March Back,
telling the story of how those

01:05:24.445 --> 01:05:29.239
1,500--those 10,000 Greeks
rather got back home.

01:05:29.239 --> 01:05:34.808
Just a word for the other
side of the argument,

01:05:34.808 --> 01:05:40.599
I want to read you a quotation
from Hans Van Wees,

01:05:40.599 --> 01:05:44.322
who is the leading critic of
the traditional orthodox

01:05:44.322 --> 01:05:48.511
explanation I just gave you.
Here's one, "It is clear that

01:05:48.511 --> 01:05:52.947
the emergence of the hoplite was
only the beginning of a lengthy

01:05:52.947 --> 01:05:56.750
process which certainly lasted
more than a century,

01:05:56.750 --> 01:06:00.061
and may have lasted more than
two centuries,

01:06:00.061 --> 01:06:04.296
leading to the creation of a
close ordered hoplites only

01:06:04.296 --> 01:06:08.305
phalanx.
The classical hoplite formation

01:06:08.305 --> 01:06:12.411
then was not the long lived
military institution of

01:06:12.411 --> 01:06:16.379
scholarly tradition,
but merely one phase in a

01:06:16.379 --> 01:06:21.285
history of almost four centuries
of slow change towards ever

01:06:21.285 --> 01:06:25.860
denser and more cohesive heavy
infantry formations."

01:06:25.860 --> 01:06:31.346
I'll read you one more of his
statements, "Those who favor an

01:06:31.346 --> 01:06:37.016
early date for the emergence of
the hoplite phalanx rely

01:06:37.016 --> 01:06:42.047
on one argument above all,
the new type of shield adopted

01:06:42.047 --> 01:06:46.090
in the late eighth century,
unlike its predecessors,

01:06:46.090 --> 01:06:50.961
could be used effectively only
in an extremely close and rigid

01:06:50.961 --> 01:06:54.142
formation.
Double grip shields thus

01:06:54.142 --> 01:06:59.050
presupposed or imposed an
extremely dense formation.

01:06:59.050 --> 01:07:04.507
The tacit assumption is that
hoplites stood frontally opposed

01:07:04.507 --> 01:07:09.581
to their enemies like wrestlers,
rather than sideways on,

01:07:09.581 --> 01:07:13.131
like fencers,
holding their shields parallel

01:07:13.131 --> 01:07:17.142
to their bodies,
but artistic representations

01:07:17.142 --> 01:07:20.980
show that this is not how
hoplites fought."

01:07:20.980 --> 01:07:25.284
I would say that the crux,
the kernel of the critique,

01:07:25.284 --> 01:07:29.286
a lot of things you can argue
about--The kernel of the

01:07:29.286 --> 01:07:33.967
critique lies in this assertion
which derives its force from an

01:07:33.967 --> 01:07:37.289
interpretation of pictures on
pottery.

01:07:37.289 --> 01:07:40.947
You can see I'm not too
friendly to that interpretation,

01:07:40.947 --> 01:07:43.940
but it is being taken very,
very seriously.

01:07:43.940 --> 01:07:48.096
So seriously,
you fortunate Yalies,

01:07:48.096 --> 01:07:54.329
that they will be here on April
9 and 10 of 2008,

01:07:54.329 --> 01:07:58.809
an international conference on
the subject of the hoplite

01:07:58.809 --> 01:08:03.050
phalanx and the emergence
of the city state.

01:08:03.050 --> 01:08:08.171
It will be a classic Greek
agonal confrontation,

01:08:08.171 --> 01:08:14.710
because among the other stars
who are going to be engaged,

01:08:14.710 --> 01:08:20.579
Curtis Easton will be one of
them, the main event will be a

01:08:20.579 --> 01:08:26.550
one-on-one between Victor Davis
Hanson and Hans Van Wees.

01:08:26.550 --> 01:08:30.190
You're all very welcome to come
on that occasion.

01:08:30.190 --> 01:08:31.523
See you next time.

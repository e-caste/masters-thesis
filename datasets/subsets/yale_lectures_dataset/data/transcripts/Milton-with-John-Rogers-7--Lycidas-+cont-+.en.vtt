00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:04.337
Professor John Rogers:
"Lycidas" is

00:00:04.337 --> 00:00:07.393
probably the most difficult poem
that we'll be reading all

00:00:07.393 --> 00:00:10.358
semester.
But, as I mentioned briefly in

00:00:10.358 --> 00:00:13.457
the last class,
the notorious difficulties

00:00:13.457 --> 00:00:18.220
attending this poem seem to have
very little to do with Milton's

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.320
grief over the death of Edward
King,

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.810
which may well not have been
all that troubled or

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.210
complicated.
We have no evidence,

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.318
and I mentioned this before,
that there was a particularly

00:00:31.318 --> 00:00:34.752
close relation between these two
young men.The difficulty of

00:00:34.752 --> 00:00:39.567
the poem lies to a great degree,
I think, in something that Dr.

00:00:39.567 --> 00:00:45.442
Johnson had noted in his attack
or in his criticism on "Lycidas"

00:00:45.442 --> 00:00:51.261
that I mentioned on Monday.
Its difficulty lies in Milton's

00:00:51.261 --> 00:00:55.256
tendency in this poem to seek
out what Dr.

00:00:55.256 --> 00:00:59.740
Johnson wonderfully calls
remote allusions.

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:05.480
This is by far the most learned
and the most demanding lyric

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:10.443
poem that Milton writes.
It's a poem deeply invested in

00:01:10.443 --> 00:01:14.743
the tradition of pastoral
poetry, pastoral poetry from

00:01:14.743 --> 00:01:19.115
Theocritus and Virgil onward.
It's a poem deeply invested,

00:01:19.115 --> 00:01:23.110
in fact, in the entire Western
tradition of poetry in general.

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.930
Finally, I think it can be said
that it's a poem whose deepest

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.435
investment is actually in
Milton's mastery over the entire

00:01:32.435 --> 00:01:37.310
Western tradition of literature.
Milton -- this will be the

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.996
working assumption that I bring
to my reading of this poem --

00:01:41.996 --> 00:01:45.980
Milton sets out to prove
something in "Lycidas,"

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:50.356
 and the most important
thing that he proves is his

00:01:50.356 --> 00:01:54.809
control over the learning that
he has accumulated.Now I

00:01:54.809 --> 00:01:59.340
spoke last time about the
familiar sense of hesitation,

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.909
that apology with which Milton
had opened the elegy.

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.760
We hear in the 1637
"Lycidas" those same

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:11.112
cries of unripeness and
under-preparation that we had

00:02:11.112 --> 00:02:15.160
heard in the 1631 sonnet,
"How Soon Hath Time,

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.404
the Subtle Thief of Youth."
When Milton opens "Lycidas"

00:02:19.404 --> 00:02:22.563
with that phrase,
"Yet once more," one of the

00:02:22.563 --> 00:02:26.249
things that he's telling the
reader is that yet once more

00:02:26.249 --> 00:02:29.870
he'll be making the same
argument for unreadiness;

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.133
the same argument for nervous
anticipation that he'd made a

00:02:33.133 --> 00:02:36.048
number of times before.
And so as a way of

00:02:36.048 --> 00:02:40.323
understanding what at this point
is really the sheer

00:02:40.323 --> 00:02:44.766
repetitiveness of this
disclaimer, I want to propose a

00:02:44.766 --> 00:02:48.233
metaphor.
I propose that we think of

00:02:48.233 --> 00:02:53.349
Milton at the opening of
"Lycidas" as being stuck,

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:56.394
stuck at a particular point in
the imagined,

00:02:56.394 --> 00:03:00.360
the projected or fantasized,
trajectory of his career.

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.403
I'm using the word "stuck," of
course, because the Lady had

00:03:04.403 --> 00:03:07.401
been stuck so famously and so
prominently in

00:03:07.401 --> 00:03:11.305
Comus.You may
remember that I had suggested in

00:03:11.305 --> 00:03:15.348
the lecture on the Nativity
Ode that Milton may have

00:03:15.348 --> 00:03:19.949
thought of his career as if it
were something like a race.

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:23.772
I think here that the
particular image of a career as

00:03:23.772 --> 00:03:28.110
a race still holds but with a
little bit of a difference.

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:32.420
What seems so obvious,
at least to me here in reading

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:37.643
"Lycidas," is that
at this point in 1637 there's a

00:03:37.643 --> 00:03:42.866
stumbling block or a hurdle that
Milton in his race simply can't

00:03:42.866 --> 00:03:46.876
get over.
Now the surest sign of a hurdle

00:03:46.876 --> 00:03:52.409
is one of those pointed literary
allusions that Milton makes in

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:55.047
"Lycidas,"
 one of those remote

00:03:55.047 --> 00:03:57.509
allusions that Johnson had
complained about.

00:03:57.509 --> 00:04:00.716
It's an allusion that has
everything to do with Milton's

00:04:00.716 --> 00:04:04.039
own sense of his unreadiness,
and I'm thinking of that.

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:06.812
Oh, it's just -- it's
wonderful, that strange moment

00:04:06.812 --> 00:04:09.150
that happens fairly early on in
the poem.

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:14.542
This is line seventy-six.
In the Hughes edition,

00:04:14.542 --> 00:04:19.009
it's page 122.
It's that moment in which

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:23.750
Phoebus Apollo makes a sudden
and unexpected appearance.

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:27.155
Now not only does Phoebus
Apollo make a sudden appearance,

00:04:27.155 --> 00:04:30.261
but he seems actually to
interrupt the speaker of the

00:04:30.261 --> 00:04:33.487
poem in order to correct
him.Let's remind ourselves

00:04:33.487 --> 00:04:37.138
what's been happening.
Milton has just been lamenting

00:04:37.138 --> 00:04:41.294
the fact that the laborious days
of the poet might not result in

00:04:41.294 --> 00:04:44.431
a sudden blaze of fame.
What good is it -- you'll

00:04:44.431 --> 00:04:46.706
remember -- what good is it,
Milton asks,

00:04:46.706 --> 00:04:49.550
"to tend the homely slighted
shepherd's trade";

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:52.271
that's, of course,
the vocation of poetry if that

00:04:52.271 --> 00:04:55.672
shepherd-poet is just going to
be struck down in his prime as

00:04:55.672 --> 00:04:59.884
Edward King had been?
You'll remember that Milton had

00:04:59.884 --> 00:05:05.472
complained that "the thin-spun
life" could be so easily slit --

00:05:05.472 --> 00:05:10.430
but look at line seventy-six:
"'But not the praise,'

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:15.600
/ Phoebus repli'd,
and touch'd my trembling ears."

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.790
Okay.
[laughs] What's happened?

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:22.076
Phoebus Apollo,
the god of the sun and,

00:05:22.076 --> 00:05:25.621
not unimportant,
also the god of poetry --

00:05:25.621 --> 00:05:31.069
Phoebus Apollo bursts in to the
text and corrects the poet,

00:05:31.069 --> 00:05:34.062
corrects the poet's youthful
interest in earthly fame:

00:05:34.062 --> 00:05:36.830
"'Fame is no plant that grows
on mortal soil.'"

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:40.708
True fame exists only in heaven.
The only reputation that

00:05:40.708 --> 00:05:44.551
matters is the praise you
ultimately receive from God or "

00:05:44.551 --> 00:05:48.461
all-judging Jove;
/ as he pronounces lastly on

00:05:48.461 --> 00:05:51.915
each deed."
And as in all of these early

00:05:51.915 --> 00:05:56.627
lyrics, Jove conventionally
throughout the Renaissance is

00:05:56.627 --> 00:06:01.339
used as a name within these
classical fictions to signify

00:06:01.339 --> 00:06:06.051
the Christian God.Now this
moment is striking in part

00:06:06.051 --> 00:06:10.932
because we had no idea -- how
could we possibly have had an

00:06:10.932 --> 00:06:13.648
idea?
-- that Phoebus Apollo was

00:06:13.648 --> 00:06:16.490
actually eavesdropping on the
poet's discourse.

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:20.571
I think we're taken aback here.
We're taken aback by the rude

00:06:20.571 --> 00:06:26.136
interruption in the otherwise
seamless flow of the poet's

00:06:26.136 --> 00:06:29.564
lament.
This moment is also striking

00:06:29.564 --> 00:06:33.910
because Milton has lifted this
entire scene of this

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:37.040
interruption from somewhere
else.

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:41.470
He has taken it from one of the
pastoral poems of Virgil.

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:46.214
The image of a poet interrupted
and chided by the god of poetry

00:06:46.214 --> 00:06:50.041
comes straight out of the
opening of Virgil's Sixth

00:06:50.041 --> 00:06:53.214
Eclogue.
Virgil had written a poem in

00:06:53.214 --> 00:06:56.515
the Sixth Eclogue that had
touched Milton,

00:06:56.515 --> 00:07:00.892
and it had touched Milton,
I think, because it begins with

00:07:00.892 --> 00:07:04.781
Virgil's own brooding meditation
on the course of his poetic

00:07:04.781 --> 00:07:07.617
career.
Now we all know what Virgil's

00:07:07.617 --> 00:07:10.620
poetic career would go on to
look like.

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:14.131
Virgil would go on to be a
great epic poet but not until

00:07:14.131 --> 00:07:17.835
after he had written these
pastoral eclogues and then after

00:07:17.835 --> 00:07:20.067
that,
after he had written the

00:07:20.067 --> 00:07:23.176
georgic poems,
only then does he write finally

00:07:23.176 --> 00:07:27.044
the great epic poem The
Aeneid.Now in Virgil's

00:07:27.044 --> 00:07:29.390
early poem,
the Sixth Eclogue,

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:33.386
the speaker explains that the
writing of pastoral poetry is

00:07:33.386 --> 00:07:37.573
the stuff that young poets do.
Poets begin their careers with

00:07:37.573 --> 00:07:40.763
easy pastoral poems,
but Virgil's speaker says that

00:07:40.763 --> 00:07:45.339
he is more ambitious now.
He's starting to champ at the

00:07:45.339 --> 00:07:47.506
bit.
He's ready to write an epic

00:07:47.506 --> 00:07:50.878
poem on much more important
subjects than shepherds and

00:07:50.878 --> 00:07:54.118
shepherdesses.
He wants to write about kings

00:07:54.118 --> 00:07:56.905
and wars.
As soon as he has expressed

00:07:56.905 --> 00:08:01.202
this epic ambition -- Virgil
explains that as soon as he's

00:08:01.202 --> 00:08:05.197
expressed this Phoebus Apollo,
the god of poetry,

00:08:05.197 --> 00:08:09.098
stepped in and chided him.
So this is Virgil:

00:08:09.098 --> 00:08:13.196
"When I was fain to sing of
kings and battles,

00:08:13.196 --> 00:08:18.294
the Cynthian god" -- that's
Phoebus Apollo -- "plucked my

00:08:18.294 --> 00:08:22.503
ear and warned me."
Apollo warns Virgil that a

00:08:22.503 --> 00:08:26.550
pastoral poet simply shouldn't
overstep his bounds.

00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:29.606
This is Virgil:
"He should sing thin [little,

00:08:29.606 --> 00:08:33.495
fine]- spun lays and he should
be content feeding his fat

00:08:33.495 --> 00:08:36.317
sheep."
The god told Virgil that he

00:08:36.317 --> 00:08:40.584
wasn't ready yet for the manly,
the adult, and the public

00:08:40.584 --> 00:08:42.870
world,
the important world,

00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:47.669
of epic poetry.All of this
anxiety, and when you think of

00:08:47.669 --> 00:08:50.462
it,
all of this shame as well as

00:08:50.462 --> 00:08:55.169
the shame of ambition -- all of
this gets packed into this

00:08:55.169 --> 00:09:00.125
allusion to Virgil that Milton
brings to this very disturbing

00:09:00.125 --> 00:09:03.229
moment in "Lycidas."
It's important,

00:09:03.229 --> 00:09:07.111
I think, that this Virgilian
scene with Apollo appears so

00:09:07.111 --> 00:09:11.226
early in Milton's "Lycidas."
Milton's "Lycidas"

00:09:11.226 --> 00:09:16.563
doesn't end up all soaked in
this unhealthy brew of --

00:09:16.563 --> 00:09:21.899
neurotic brew of anxiety and
shame and naked ambition.

00:09:21.899 --> 00:09:25.470
I think it's one of our jobs
here to figure out why that's

00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:28.451
the case.
Why doesn't -- this is one way

00:09:28.451 --> 00:09:33.110
of putting the question -- why
doesn't Apollo harass or bother

00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:37.081
Milton at the end of
"Lycidas" in the same way

00:09:37.081 --> 00:09:41.129
that he harasses Milton at the
poem's beginning?

00:09:41.129 --> 00:09:44.951
Now I think you may be
rather happy to hear that this

00:09:44.951 --> 00:09:49.113
is the last time -- I'm pretty
sure that this is the last time

00:09:49.113 --> 00:09:53.249
-- that we will have to discuss,
at least at any length,

00:09:53.249 --> 00:09:56.535
Milton's worries about his
unreadiness and his

00:09:56.535 --> 00:09:58.981
un-preparation.
It's safe to say that

00:09:58.981 --> 00:10:02.162
"Lycidas" is one of the
last poetic works of Milton's

00:10:02.162 --> 00:10:04.480
that's really consumed with his
problem,

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:06.750
the problem of fruitless
anticipation.

00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:10.946
In some ways I think that
that's because the poem

00:10:10.946 --> 00:10:16.191
"Lycidas" seems in some ways to
solve the problem of Milton's

00:10:16.191 --> 00:10:19.436
waiting,
this problem that he has of

00:10:19.436 --> 00:10:23.165
needing to wait.
And so one of the things that

00:10:23.165 --> 00:10:28.259
needs to be explored here is why
this poem is the last poem that

00:10:28.259 --> 00:10:33.316
Milton is not prepared to write.
What does Milton do -- this is

00:10:33.316 --> 00:10:37.250
what I see as our project,
our interpretive project,

00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:43.282
as we approach this poem --
what does Milton do to get

00:10:43.282 --> 00:10:49.769
himself unstuck from this seat
of anxious anticipation?

00:10:49.769 --> 00:10:53.436
That's the project.So we
looked last time at the oddity,

00:10:53.436 --> 00:10:56.108
the peculiarity,
of Milton's choice of genre

00:10:56.108 --> 00:10:59.987
here, the pastoral genre.
Milton was the only Cambridge

00:10:59.987 --> 00:11:03.856
poet to honor Edward King in
that memorial anthology by

00:11:03.856 --> 00:11:06.649
writing a poem in the pastoral
mode.

00:11:06.649 --> 00:11:10.144
A pastoral, of course,
features shepherds and

00:11:10.144 --> 00:11:14.750
shepherdesses as its most
distinguishing characteristic.

00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:19.313
The word pastoral comes
from the Latin pastor,

00:11:19.313 --> 00:11:22.019
which literally means
"shepherd,"

00:11:22.019 --> 00:11:25.667
and Milton knew perfectly well
how artificial his use of the

00:11:25.667 --> 00:11:29.068
pastoral mode of poetry would
seem as well as how out of

00:11:29.068 --> 00:11:31.194
fashion,
how completely outdated,

00:11:31.194 --> 00:11:33.618
it would seem.
One of the motives for his

00:11:33.618 --> 00:11:36.196
selection of this genre,
the pastoral genre,

00:11:36.196 --> 00:11:39.853
is the tradition -- and it's a
tradition that goes all the way

00:11:39.853 --> 00:11:43.570
back to Theocritus and Virgil --
that associates shepherds with

00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:45.904
poets.
This has always been a part of

00:11:45.904 --> 00:11:48.795
the pastoral genre.
To speak of shepherds and

00:11:48.795 --> 00:11:53.324
shepherding in a pastoral poem
seems almost invariably to be a

00:11:53.324 --> 00:11:58.149
strategy or a way to speak of
poets and their craft of poetry.

00:11:58.149 --> 00:12:02.209
This is a kind of literary
self-consciousness that we're

00:12:02.209 --> 00:12:06.416
all familiar with.But
there's another meaning given to

00:12:06.416 --> 00:12:09.655
shepherds as well.
After the long sway of

00:12:09.655 --> 00:12:12.885
Theocritus' and Virgil's
pastorals, of course

00:12:12.885 --> 00:12:16.850
Christianity entered the scene,
a new dispensation;

00:12:16.850 --> 00:12:20.927
and Christianity began to load
this pastoral literary tradition

00:12:20.927 --> 00:12:23.230
with its own set of
associations.

00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:29.549
Shepherds came to represent not
only poets.

00:12:29.549 --> 00:12:32.797
They came to stand for
ministers, they came to signify

00:12:32.797 --> 00:12:36.781
allegorically ministers as well.
So priests, ministers or

00:12:36.781 --> 00:12:40.981
pastors -- we still call them
pastors -- had long been

00:12:40.981 --> 00:12:44.790
referred to as shepherds.
They are leaders of their

00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:47.402
flocks.
And so it seemed a natural move

00:12:47.402 --> 00:12:51.539
for early Christian writers to
use this existing pastoral form

00:12:51.539 --> 00:12:55.540
when they wanted to speak on
subject of priests or ministers

00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:58.863
or affairs of the
church.Milton is essentially

00:12:58.863 --> 00:13:01.779
inheriting both of these
traditions,

00:13:01.779 --> 00:13:05.615
both of these sets of
associations with pastoral

00:13:05.615 --> 00:13:08.579
poetry.
When we consider the particular

00:13:08.579 --> 00:13:12.750
circumstances that occasioned
the poem "Lycidas," we

00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:16.130
can see why Milton,
I think, chose this pastoral

00:13:16.130 --> 00:13:17.901
form.
Edward King,

00:13:17.901 --> 00:13:21.055
the young man,
the elegized deceased,

00:13:21.055 --> 00:13:26.750
was a minor poet on his way to
begin his career as a minister,

00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:31.447
and the figure of the shepherd,
the pastor, fuses into one

00:13:31.447 --> 00:13:36.310
person or into one figurative
entity both of these callings:

00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:41.419
the vocation of the poet and
the vocation of the minister.

00:13:41.419 --> 00:13:44.487
We've looked before at Milton's
Reason of Church

00:13:44.487 --> 00:13:47.988
Government.
That's the political treatise

00:13:47.988 --> 00:13:51.108
written in 1642.
We've seen Milton's account

00:13:51.108 --> 00:13:54.899
there of how he had attempted to
reconcile, on the one hand,

00:13:54.899 --> 00:13:58.501
his obligation to become a
minister and his desire,

00:13:58.501 --> 00:14:01.959
on the other hand,
to become a poet.I want to

00:14:01.959 --> 00:14:06.353
back up now because I think it's
important to fill in a little

00:14:06.353 --> 00:14:10.603
bit of the historical context
behind that long but important

00:14:10.603 --> 00:14:14.792
prose treatise.
It's not irrelevant to our

00:14:14.792 --> 00:14:18.927
understanding of "Lycidas."
The subject of The

00:14:18.927 --> 00:14:22.307
Reason of Church Government
is Milton's feelings about

00:14:22.307 --> 00:14:25.629
the hierarchical structure of
the Church of the England.

00:14:25.629 --> 00:14:28.565
In the early years of the
English Revolution,

00:14:28.565 --> 00:14:32.700
one of the hottest flash points
of political contention was the

00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:36.570
degree of appropriate state
involvement in the church.

00:14:36.570 --> 00:14:39.326
As with almost all of the
issues of contemporary and

00:14:39.326 --> 00:14:41.919
political struggle in the
seventeenth century,

00:14:41.919 --> 00:14:45.671
Milton's own views really pull
decidedly to the left,

00:14:45.671 --> 00:14:49.350
to the progressive end of the
political spectrum.

00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:54.270
Beginning in the late 1630s at
the moment in which "Lycidas"

00:14:54.270 --> 00:14:58.397
is being written,
Milton is becoming increasingly

00:14:58.397 --> 00:15:00.814
radical.
We can think of it -- this is

00:15:00.814 --> 00:15:03.389
an anachronistic term -- but
increasingly leftist,

00:15:03.389 --> 00:15:08.791
and he's becoming one of those
figures that we can now identify

00:15:08.791 --> 00:15:12.973
with this label of
"Puritan."Puritans at this

00:15:12.973 --> 00:15:16.720
moment in English history were
placing,

00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:20.862
when thinking about how things
should work at church,

00:15:20.862 --> 00:15:23.970
more and more emphasis on the
sermon,

00:15:23.970 --> 00:15:27.453
the institution of the sermon.
The act of preaching sermons

00:15:27.453 --> 00:15:30.727
for Puritans was becoming more
important, actually,

00:15:30.727 --> 00:15:34.198
than following the ceremonial
rituals of the Church of

00:15:34.198 --> 00:15:37.477
England.
So in the years just before

00:15:37.477 --> 00:15:42.601
1637, the English court under
James I and then later under

00:15:42.601 --> 00:15:47.904
Charles I -- the English crown
had been cracking down on the

00:15:47.904 --> 00:15:52.129
delivery of Puritan sermons in
the church.

00:15:52.129 --> 00:15:56.052
In 1633, William Laud had been
appointed the Archbishop of

00:15:56.052 --> 00:16:00.042
Canterbury, and he had been
granted an extraordinary set of

00:16:00.042 --> 00:16:07.179
arbitrary powers of suppression,
actually, by the monarch.

00:16:07.179 --> 00:16:11.668
Laud took his mission as
the head of the Church of

00:16:11.668 --> 00:16:16.580
England to be the squelching of
this Puritan opposition.

00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:22.553
The most outrageous action in
Laud's crackdown was his move to

00:16:22.553 --> 00:16:27.450
ban -- his attempt to ban
preaching in churches.

00:16:27.450 --> 00:16:31.320
So under Archbishop Laud,
only the official liturgy could

00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:34.942
be recited in church.
As you can imagine,

00:16:34.942 --> 00:16:39.244
this was controversial.
A struggle breaks out in the

00:16:39.244 --> 00:16:42.776
church, and Milton naturally
takes the Puritan position in

00:16:42.776 --> 00:16:45.656
favor of preaching.
The church shouldn't be under

00:16:45.656 --> 00:16:48.792
the control of the bishops --
this is Milton's argument -- or

00:16:48.792 --> 00:16:51.293
prelates,
a common seventeenth-century

00:16:51.293 --> 00:16:54.506
word for bishops,
but the church should be led by

00:16:54.506 --> 00:16:58.186
preachers: men who were chosen
by their congregations to

00:16:58.186 --> 00:17:00.741
preach.
Eventually this is where we get

00:17:00.741 --> 00:17:03.170
the notion of
congregationalism.So given

00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:06.389
all of the controversies raging
around the question of the

00:17:06.389 --> 00:17:11.359
proper government of the church,
and Milton is deeply invested

00:17:11.359 --> 00:17:15.629
in these matters,
Milton feels obliged to do

00:17:15.629 --> 00:17:18.777
something.
This is one of the reasons that

00:17:18.777 --> 00:17:21.833
he writes The Reason
of Church Government,

00:17:21.833 --> 00:17:25.069
this intense sense of
obligation that he feels.

00:17:25.069 --> 00:17:29.852
He feels duty-bound to
participate materially in this

00:17:29.852 --> 00:17:35.002
political controversy rather
than merely remaining in his

00:17:35.002 --> 00:17:38.881
studious retirement,
however pleasant that is,

00:17:38.881 --> 00:17:41.721
at his father's house.
Were Milton not to fight in

00:17:41.721 --> 00:17:44.420
some way to defend what he takes
to be the true church,

00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:47.420
he would simply not be
investing those talents that God

00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:50.617
had given him.
This is the Miltonic logic that

00:17:50.617 --> 00:17:55.009
we're familiar with.So this
is the situation that Milton

00:17:55.009 --> 00:17:59.772
finds himself in as he's writing
"Lycidas." He's under the

00:17:59.772 --> 00:18:04.759
greatest pressure of his life to
do something with his talent.

00:18:04.759 --> 00:18:09.091
He wants of course -- at least
we assume that he still wants to

00:18:09.091 --> 00:18:11.176
be a poet.
At the same time,

00:18:11.176 --> 00:18:15.430
he fears that being a poet
means -- and this is a fear that

00:18:15.430 --> 00:18:19.829
literate young men and women
have to this very day -- to be a

00:18:19.829 --> 00:18:23.716
poet means in some way not to be
acting responsibly or

00:18:23.716 --> 00:18:27.126
politically.
So Milton explains in The

00:18:27.126 --> 00:18:31.590
Reason of Church Government --
he tries to mend this breach

00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:35.407
and so he argues in this
treatise that "Poetry has" --

00:18:35.407 --> 00:18:39.511
and I'm quoting him here --
"Poetry has a power beside the

00:18:39.511 --> 00:18:43.197
office of the pulpit."
Milton even claims that poetry

00:18:43.197 --> 00:18:45.912
is equal to preaching in its
ability to move people,

00:18:45.912 --> 00:18:48.894
to get them to do something,
to make things happen in the

00:18:48.894 --> 00:18:50.362
world.
Of course,

00:18:50.362 --> 00:18:54.017
this is a lot of pressure to
put on poetry and especially a

00:18:54.017 --> 00:18:57.736
lot of pressure to put on a
pastoral elegy that's ostensibly

00:18:57.736 --> 00:19:02.136
about shepherds and sheep;
but it is the duty of this poem

00:19:02.136 --> 00:19:06.870
"Lycidas" to show that
poetry can exert a power beside

00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:10.980
the office of the pulpit,
that it can do the same kind of

00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:14.779
work that a preacher is able to
accomplish behind the pulpit.

00:19:14.779 --> 00:19:19.017
Milton has to develop a poetic
voice that can actually combine

00:19:19.017 --> 00:19:21.517
those two vocations,
the two offices,

00:19:21.517 --> 00:19:25.130
the office of poetry and the
office of ministry.

00:19:25.130 --> 00:19:29.643
If we want to think of it in
the more familiar domestic

00:19:29.643 --> 00:19:34.575
context, Milton has to begin a
career that could please both

00:19:34.575 --> 00:19:39.173
himself and his father.Now
last time I mentioned the

00:19:39.173 --> 00:19:44.315
dramatic structure of this poem.
You'll remember it features a

00:19:44.315 --> 00:19:48.177
succession of four mourners,
and we could think of each of

00:19:48.177 --> 00:19:52.446
these mourners providing Milton
with an opportunity to try out a

00:19:52.446 --> 00:19:56.343
different voice.
One of the voices utterly mops

00:19:56.343 --> 00:19:59.890
the floor [laughs]
with all of the others.

00:19:59.890 --> 00:20:04.930
Certainly, it stands far
outside the generally pastoral

00:20:04.930 --> 00:20:08.250
framework of the poem.
The most striking,

00:20:08.250 --> 00:20:11.069
the most powerful,
of all of the mourning voices

00:20:11.069 --> 00:20:15.440
here is that of Saint Peter.
This is the figure that Milton

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:19.541
refers to in line 109 as the
Pilot of the Galilean

00:20:19.541 --> 00:20:24.059
Lake.Now what's Saint Peter
doing in this poem?

00:20:24.059 --> 00:20:27.769
The very mention of Saint Peter
naturally violates the

00:20:27.769 --> 00:20:30.710
classical, pastoral fiction of
the poem.

00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:32.807
Up to this point,
the Christian God has been

00:20:32.807 --> 00:20:36.315
referred to as Jove.
That's how the poem works since

00:20:36.315 --> 00:20:40.713
it's within the pagan world,
the pagan fictional world of

00:20:40.713 --> 00:20:45.269
the classical pastoral that this
Christian poem is set.

00:20:45.269 --> 00:20:49.847
To speak both of Jove and of
Christ is obviously in some ways

00:20:49.847 --> 00:20:54.730
to mix your metaphors and the
effect can only be disorienting.

00:20:54.730 --> 00:20:58.421
The character of Peter brought
directly out of the New

00:20:58.421 --> 00:21:02.113
Testament is really slicing
through the poem's fictive

00:21:02.113 --> 00:21:05.181
veneer.
Peter cuts a figure so daunting

00:21:05.181 --> 00:21:09.412
and so terrifying that we're
almost led to forget that the

00:21:09.412 --> 00:21:13.049
poem we're reading is a pastoral
elegy at all,

00:21:13.049 --> 00:21:16.500
so unbelievable is Peter's
discourse.

00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:21.065
Okay, line 109: 
Last came,

00:21:21.065 --> 00:21:24.759
and last did go, The Pilot
of the Galilean Lake.

00:21:24.759 --> 00:21:28.597
Two massy Keys he bore of
metals twain (The Golden

00:21:28.597 --> 00:21:32.975
opes, the Iron shuts amain).
He shook his Mitred locks,

00:21:32.975 --> 00:21:37.950
and stern bespake…
Now this is important to Milton.

00:21:37.950 --> 00:21:41.838
This is decidedly the last of
all the funeral mourners,

00:21:41.838 --> 00:21:45.943
and Peter provides Milton's
poem with an important element

00:21:45.943 --> 00:21:49.343
of finality, of closure.
Peter wields the keys of the

00:21:49.343 --> 00:21:52.307
kingdom of heaven and can open
and shut the doors of personal

00:21:52.307 --> 00:21:55.596
salvation,
just as he can open and shut

00:21:55.596 --> 00:22:01.359
the doors of the church.
That's his function.

00:22:01.359 --> 00:22:04.830
It's the sentiments that Peter
utters that, I think,

00:22:04.830 --> 00:22:08.441
most powerfully grab us,
and they grab us because they

00:22:08.441 --> 00:22:11.680
are so angry -- they're so
violent in their anger.

00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:15.759
As the head of the true church,
Peter's voicing here his

00:22:15.759 --> 00:22:20.505
disgust that the virtuous Edward
King, soon to become a minister,

00:22:20.505 --> 00:22:23.311
had been lost at sea.
Think of the logic of what

00:22:23.311 --> 00:22:25.940
Peter's saying here.
He would gladly have traded

00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:29.798
dozens -- he would have traded
dozens of corrupt Anglican

00:22:29.798 --> 00:22:32.830
ministers for the simple and
honest King.

00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:36.700
Look at line 113.
This is where Peter is

00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:40.449
addressing Edward King himself:
How well could I have

00:22:40.449 --> 00:22:43.373
spared for thee,
young swain, Enough of such

00:22:43.373 --> 00:22:47.579
as for their bellies' sake,
 Creep and intrude and

00:22:47.579 --> 00:22:51.746
climb into the fold?
The corrupt clergy of today,

00:22:51.746 --> 00:22:55.343
under the malign influence of
the horrible Archbishop Laud,

00:22:55.343 --> 00:22:58.630
are interested only in
satisfying their own greed.

00:22:58.630 --> 00:23:02.267
In order to fill their own
bellies, so greedy are they,

00:23:02.267 --> 00:23:06.375
they intruded into the church's
fold and devour for themselves

00:23:06.375 --> 00:23:10.214
-- this is how the allegory
works -- devour for themselves

00:23:10.214 --> 00:23:14.053
the nourishment that of course
they should be sharing with

00:23:14.053 --> 00:23:16.882
their flock.But this wish
that [laughs]

00:23:16.882 --> 00:23:21.530
other shepherds had died and
not Edward King is so strange.

00:23:21.530 --> 00:23:24.356
You can't deny it.
There is something here of a

00:23:24.356 --> 00:23:28.554
kind of indecorous tone of
malice, that the priests and the

00:23:28.554 --> 00:23:32.970
prelates of the church are so
corrupt according to Saint Peter

00:23:32.970 --> 00:23:37.240
that we're led to assume almost
-- not that this is a direct

00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:41.120
charge but implicitly,
I think, this is what Peter is

00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:44.680
conveying -- it's almost as if
they're responsible for Edward

00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:47.199
King's death;
as if by creeping into the

00:23:47.199 --> 00:23:49.916
church's fold,
somehow they've managed to push

00:23:49.916 --> 00:23:52.089
poor Edward King out of the
fold.

00:23:52.089 --> 00:23:56.256
It's a hint at the malevolent
agency of these priests,

00:23:56.256 --> 00:24:00.659
and it should point us to the
true outrageousness of this

00:24:00.659 --> 00:24:04.962
speech, maybe its irrationality.
We already know that Edward

00:24:04.962 --> 00:24:08.015
King -- of course he wasn't
killed by the prelates of the

00:24:08.015 --> 00:24:10.961
Church of England!
He was drowned and the drowning

00:24:10.961 --> 00:24:14.171
was an accident.
The poem never questions that,

00:24:14.171 --> 00:24:18.539
and it's ridiculous to lay his
death at the church's door.

00:24:18.539 --> 00:24:23.936
The poem nonetheless harbors
this wonderfully primitive and

00:24:23.936 --> 00:24:28.175
irrational accusation.
There's a lapse in logic here,

00:24:28.175 --> 00:24:32.120
and this lapse should focus our
interest all the more on the

00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:35.330
urgency that we feel in Saint
Peter's speech.

00:24:35.330 --> 00:24:39.576
This isn't just a speech.
This is a vitriolic tirade,

00:24:39.576 --> 00:24:43.869
and it gets ugly.
Milton needs to get ugly here.

00:24:43.869 --> 00:24:47.653
He needs to voice this tirade,
and he needs to write this

00:24:47.653 --> 00:24:51.031
politically motivated
harangue.As you'll see it

00:24:51.031 --> 00:24:55.220
starts to pick up more and more
enemies as it moves along.

00:24:55.220 --> 00:24:59.440
Look at line 119: 
Blind mouths!

00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:02.856
that scarce themselves know how
to hold A Sheep-hook,

00:25:02.856 --> 00:25:06.516
or have learn'd aught else the
least That to the faithful

00:25:06.516 --> 00:25:10.259
Herdman's art belongs!"
The faithful herdman's art in

00:25:10.259 --> 00:25:13.606
"Lycidas" is a double one.
It's the Christian art of

00:25:13.606 --> 00:25:17.564
ministering to a religious
flock, it's that of the pastor,

00:25:17.564 --> 00:25:20.690
and it's the more classical art
of poetry.

00:25:20.690 --> 00:25:24.655
The men against whom Saint
Peter is really spitting his

00:25:24.655 --> 00:25:28.400
venom are bad pastors in every
sense of the word.

00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:31.225
They're corrupt not only as
ministers but they are also

00:25:31.225 --> 00:25:33.600
corrupt as poets.
They're bad poets.

00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:41.502
Look at line 123.
These are such great lines:

00:25:41.502 --> 00:25:47.478
"And when they list,
their lean and flashy songs /

00:25:47.478 --> 00:25:53.819
grate on their scrannel Pipes of
wretched straw."

00:25:53.819 --> 00:25:57.162
I have to read these lines
again: "And when they list,

00:25:57.162 --> 00:26:01.008
their lean and flashy songs /
grate on their scrannel Pipes of

00:26:01.008 --> 00:26:04.260
wretched straw."
It seems to be the case that

00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:07.529
Milton's made this word up,
this wonderful word

00:26:07.529 --> 00:26:10.127
scrannel.
It seems to mean something like

00:26:10.127 --> 00:26:11.859
"scrawny."
At least that's what the OED

00:26:11.859 --> 00:26:14.488
tells us;
the only example that they can

00:26:14.488 --> 00:26:17.813
find of the word scrannel
is in Milton's

00:26:17.813 --> 00:26:22.006
"Lycidas."This last line
that I've read seems itself to

00:26:22.006 --> 00:26:24.970
have been grated on a scrannel
pipe.

00:26:24.970 --> 00:26:29.107
It's such an unpleasant line.
It's always worth asking

00:26:29.107 --> 00:26:32.921
yourself what a line of poetry
that is as aggressively

00:26:32.921 --> 00:26:36.160
unpleasant as this one is doing
in a poem.

00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:40.472
The sheer cacophony of the
clustered consonants in this

00:26:40.472 --> 00:26:44.624
line sets off -- or has the
potential to set off -- a

00:26:44.624 --> 00:26:49.457
powerful cluster of feelings.
The anger here is directed

00:26:49.457 --> 00:26:53.936
against the superficial,
the flashy, liturgies read by

00:26:53.936 --> 00:26:57.917
the Laudian priests,
but I think it's also being

00:26:57.917 --> 00:27:02.594
directed at the lean and flashy
songs that are being written by

00:27:02.594 --> 00:27:07.059
Milton's poetic contemporaries,
his rival poets.

00:27:07.059 --> 00:27:12.199
Saint Peter has arrived from
heaven into this poem to express

00:27:12.199 --> 00:27:17.338
perhaps for the first time the
envy and the anger that Milton

00:27:17.338 --> 00:27:21.963
seems successfully to have
suppressed up to this point:

00:27:21.963 --> 00:27:27.102
envy and anger not only at the
state of the Church of England

00:27:27.102 --> 00:27:32.155
in the late 1630s but also the
state of poetry in England at

00:27:32.155 --> 00:27:37.980
this time.So Saint Peter
concludes with -- it goes on,

00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:42.260
and he concludes with a couplet
that is as terrifying in its

00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:46.396
threat of finality as it is for
me utterly baffling in its

00:27:46.396 --> 00:27:49.748
significance.
Look at the last two lines:

00:27:49.748 --> 00:27:54.613
"But that two-handed engine at
the door / stands ready to smite

00:27:54.613 --> 00:27:58.319
once, and smite no more."
Now we will never know,

00:27:58.319 --> 00:28:01.796
and don't let anyone ever
suggest to you that you will

00:28:01.796 --> 00:28:04.478
ever know,
what Milton could possibly mean

00:28:04.478 --> 00:28:08.075
by this deliberately perplexing
image of the two-handed engine

00:28:08.075 --> 00:28:10.607
at the door.
If you ever want to take a look

00:28:10.607 --> 00:28:13.530
at -- and I urge you to --
The Variorum Commentary on

00:28:13.530 --> 00:28:16.400
the Poems of John Milton in
the CCL collection,

00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:19.108
you should peruse it.
It's a massive,

00:28:19.108 --> 00:28:22.605
wonderful multi-volume work
that catalogs all of the

00:28:22.605 --> 00:28:26.581
critical commentary on Milton's
shorter poems up until some

00:28:26.581 --> 00:28:31.314
point in the ‘70s.
There are no less than twenty

00:28:31.314 --> 00:28:36.519
pages devoted to the critical
debate on these two lines:

00:28:36.519 --> 00:28:41.440
what the hell Saint Peter's
two-handed engine is,

00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:43.572
what it looks like,
what it [laughs]

00:28:43.572 --> 00:28:46.009
does, what -- and everything
about it.

00:28:46.009 --> 00:28:49.578
We have no idea what this
menacing contraption actually is

00:28:49.578 --> 00:28:52.958
supposed to look like or what
it's actually intended to

00:28:52.958 --> 00:28:55.438
signify,
but we can know,

00:28:55.438 --> 00:29:01.920
I think, with some certainty
that it's not scrannel.

00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:06.026
Size matters here;
and this -- the two-handed

00:29:06.026 --> 00:29:08.479
engine -- is big,
and it works,

00:29:08.479 --> 00:29:12.158
and it's able to put an
apocalyptic end to all

00:29:12.158 --> 00:29:16.738
corruption and in fact it's able
to put something like an

00:29:16.738 --> 00:29:21.572
apocalyptic end to all life.
It stands ready to smite once

00:29:21.572 --> 00:29:25.518
and smite no more.Now we
began this poem with the sense

00:29:25.518 --> 00:29:29.259
of the dreary repetitiveness in
that opening phrase,

00:29:29.259 --> 00:29:34.433
"Yet once more," but here very
close to the poem's end we have

00:29:34.433 --> 00:29:38.927
a vision of an end to all those
fruitless exercises of

00:29:38.927 --> 00:29:42.135
repetition.
Milton corrects -- it's as if

00:29:42.135 --> 00:29:46.139
he's correcting the sense of
monotony with which he had begun

00:29:46.139 --> 00:29:50.275
the poem,
and he corrects that sense of

00:29:50.275 --> 00:29:55.220
monotony by rewriting that
initial phrase.

00:29:55.220 --> 00:30:01.316
Whatever the two-handed engine
is, it will smite once and smite

00:30:01.316 --> 00:30:04.129
no more.
It's incapable of repeating

00:30:04.129 --> 00:30:07.042
itself.Now,
I think there's a deliberate

00:30:07.042 --> 00:30:11.378
confusion here about these lines
because their precise historical

00:30:11.378 --> 00:30:14.630
significance isn't what's most
significant.

00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:20.052
What may be most important here
is the mere fact that Milton is

00:30:20.052 --> 00:30:24.250
expressing these political
convictions at all.

00:30:24.250 --> 00:30:28.150
The speech of Saint Peter
seems, I think,

00:30:28.150 --> 00:30:33.806
in a lot of ways to be a lot
more like a fire and brimstone

00:30:33.806 --> 00:30:38.779
sermon than it is a passage in a
pastoral poem.

00:30:38.779 --> 00:30:42.780
The strangely sermonic tone
that this speech assumes is,

00:30:42.780 --> 00:30:47.158
I think, exactly the point.
Milton is able in this speech

00:30:47.158 --> 00:30:50.757
to combine, I think,
for the first time the two

00:30:50.757 --> 00:30:55.059
associations borne by that Latin
word pastor.

00:30:55.059 --> 00:30:58.333
So in this guise with the mask
of Saint Peter on he's --

00:30:58.333 --> 00:31:01.190
Milton's -- able to be both poet
and minister.

00:31:01.190 --> 00:31:05.112
He's investing his rhetorical
talent in an art that's actually

00:31:05.112 --> 00:31:08.046
doing something.
It's capable of moving people

00:31:08.046 --> 00:31:10.680
to action, or so Milton may have
believed.

00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:13.630
It's as if Milton is saying,
"Look at me.

00:31:13.630 --> 00:31:17.366
I may be a poet.
I may actually -- I'm simply

00:31:17.366 --> 00:31:21.566
writing a pastoral poem,
but I'm actually doing

00:31:21.566 --> 00:31:25.319
something in the world.
I'm ministering to a flock.

00:31:25.319 --> 00:31:30.171
I'm preaching just as my father
and just as all of my Cambridge

00:31:30.171 --> 00:31:32.910
classmates had advised me to
do."

00:31:32.910 --> 00:31:36.642
This outburst allows Milton to
solve what may have seemed up to

00:31:36.642 --> 00:31:39.953
this point an insoluble
conflict: the insoluble conflict

00:31:39.953 --> 00:31:43.685
between the two meanings of the
word vocation that we've

00:31:43.685 --> 00:31:47.543
been exploring.
So this passage is extreme and

00:31:47.543 --> 00:31:49.791
Milton's poem,
wonderfully,

00:31:49.791 --> 00:31:55.065
is perfectly able to identify
it as such.Look what happens

00:31:55.065 --> 00:31:57.895
next.
After the passage is over,

00:31:57.895 --> 00:32:02.054
Milton addresses Alpheus,
a river god -- the god who was

00:32:02.054 --> 00:32:06.742
noted for plunging the course of
his river underground in order

00:32:06.742 --> 00:32:11.960
to chase the nymph Arethuse who
had been turned into a fountain.

00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:15.462
Alpheus is also the god of
erotic pastoral poetry,

00:32:15.462 --> 00:32:18.535
it turns out,
and this god is literally gone

00:32:18.535 --> 00:32:22.252
underground during the
terrifying appearance of Saint

00:32:22.252 --> 00:32:24.687
Peter.
It's here although we didn't

00:32:24.687 --> 00:32:26.453
know the god was there.
[laughs]

00:32:26.453 --> 00:32:29.500
This is another familiar and
strange feature of this poem.

00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:32.164
We didn't know the god was
there, and we didn't know he was

00:32:32.164 --> 00:32:34.920
underground until Milton tells
us that he's coming up now.

00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:39.398
It's here, once that speech is
over, that Milton can bid

00:32:39.398 --> 00:32:42.329
Alpheus return,
line 132: "Return,

00:32:42.329 --> 00:32:46.993
Alpheus, the dread voice is
past / that shrunk thy

00:32:46.993 --> 00:32:52.323
streams…"The dread
voice of the angry sermonic

00:32:52.323 --> 00:32:55.913
Milton,
the ministerial Milton,

00:32:55.913 --> 00:32:59.270
has passed.
It has passed and it is past.

00:32:59.270 --> 00:33:03.634
It's part of the past.
And it's at this point,

00:33:03.634 --> 00:33:05.581
and I think it's,
importantly,

00:33:05.581 --> 00:33:09.011
not before this point,
that Milton's able to throw

00:33:09.011 --> 00:33:11.930
himself fully into that
eroticized conjecture,

00:33:11.930 --> 00:33:15.887
that catalog of all the flowers
that was to be thrown onto the

00:33:15.887 --> 00:33:19.910
hearse bearing Lycidas' body
that we looked at last time.

00:33:19.910 --> 00:33:23.360
I mentioned in the last lecture
that the famous flower passage

00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:25.849
here of course is -- this is
pure fantasy.

00:33:25.849 --> 00:33:30.361
Lycidas' body is nowhere to be
found, and there's nothing,

00:33:30.361 --> 00:33:33.289
of course, to throw the flowers
on;

00:33:33.289 --> 00:33:38.132
but I think we can see now a
way in which Milton has

00:33:38.132 --> 00:33:44.400
permitted himself the fantasy of
this -- of a recovered body or,

00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:48.283
as he says, this is line 153,
he has allowed his "frail

00:33:48.283 --> 00:33:51.160
thoughts to dally with false
surmise."

00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:56.086
Milton can allow himself a
literary indulgence in the rich

00:33:56.086 --> 00:34:00.367
sensuality of this passage
because he has mastered the

00:34:00.367 --> 00:34:03.988
dread voice,
he has mastered the fatherly

00:34:03.988 --> 00:34:07.964
sternness of Saint Peter.
It's as if Milton -- we can

00:34:07.964 --> 00:34:10.719
think of Milton as having paid
his dues.

00:34:10.719 --> 00:34:13.852
He's accomplished his
ministerial duty as a zealous

00:34:13.852 --> 00:34:17.674
and a politically oriented poet,
and now he's earned the right

00:34:17.674 --> 00:34:21.319
to dally with false surmise.
He's earned the right to treat

00:34:21.319 --> 00:34:24.489
himself to this absolutely
lovely -- what must have been an

00:34:24.489 --> 00:34:27.549
extraordinary amount of fun to
write -- lovely catalog of

00:34:27.549 --> 00:34:30.830
flowers.
It's almost as if the flower

00:34:30.830 --> 00:34:36.340
passage is Milton's reward for
having written the Saint Peter

00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:38.986
passage.
And I'm trying to suggest that

00:34:38.986 --> 00:34:42.259
Milton's composition of this
poem is actually doing something

00:34:42.259 --> 00:34:44.859
for him,
that it gets him somewhere,

00:34:44.859 --> 00:34:48.932
and that it's functional in a
genuine sense.It's our

00:34:48.932 --> 00:34:52.710
obligation now to look at the
poem's conclusion.

00:34:52.710 --> 00:34:57.160
Where does "Lycidas" lead
Milton?

00:34:57.160 --> 00:35:01.226
Look at line 183.
Milton imagines Lycidas in

00:35:01.226 --> 00:35:03.860
heaven now.
It's a Christian poem.

00:35:03.860 --> 00:35:07.940
Then it imagines Lycidas a
little differently as the

00:35:07.940 --> 00:35:11.940
genius loci,
the natural classical spirit of

00:35:11.940 --> 00:35:15.517
the place,
the genius loci of the

00:35:15.517 --> 00:35:17.909
Irish Sea.
This is line 183: 

00:35:17.909 --> 00:35:23.697
Henceforth thou art the
Genius of the shore, In thy

00:35:23.697 --> 00:35:28.038
large recompense,
and shalt be good To all

00:35:28.038 --> 00:35:31.800
that wander in that perilous
flood.

00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:37.397
[Period.] 
Thus sang the uncouth

00:35:37.397 --> 00:35:41.436
Swain to th'Oaks and rills,
While the still morn went out

00:35:41.436 --> 00:35:45.007
with Sandals gray;
He touch't the tender stops of

00:35:45.007 --> 00:35:49.034
various Quills, With eager
thought warbling his Doric

00:35:49.034 --> 00:35:53.349
lay: And now the Sun had
stretch't out all the hills,

00:35:53.349 --> 00:35:56.710
 And now was dropt into the
Western bay;

00:35:56.710 --> 00:36:00.653
At last he rose,
and twitch't his Mantle

00:36:00.653 --> 00:36:06.719
blue: Tomorrow to fresh
Woods, and Pastures new.

00:36:06.719 --> 00:36:11.340
I want to draw your attention
to line 186.

00:36:11.340 --> 00:36:16.474
This is the line that begins
the poem's final verse paragraph

00:36:16.474 --> 00:36:21.351
and it has to be one of the most
amazing moments in all of

00:36:21.351 --> 00:36:26.589
English literature.
"Thus sang" -- these five

00:36:26.589 --> 00:36:31.560
words: "Thus sang the uncouth
swain."

00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:32.940
Okay.
What are we being told here?

00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:37.762
This poem, this entire poem
before this point hasn't been

00:36:37.762 --> 00:36:42.024
sung by John Milton at all.
We naturally thought that it

00:36:42.024 --> 00:36:45.993
was the poet John Milton who was
speaking the first 185 lines of

00:36:45.993 --> 00:36:48.313
the poem.
We naturally assumed that it

00:36:48.313 --> 00:36:50.994
was Milton himself who was
describing his college

00:36:50.994 --> 00:36:53.340
friendship with "Lycidas"'
Edward King.

00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:58.343
We naturally assumed that the
poet was speaking,

00:36:58.343 --> 00:37:04.102
even behind the pastoral mask,
because we'd been given no idea

00:37:04.102 --> 00:37:08.732
whatsoever of any alternative to
the poet's responsibility for

00:37:08.732 --> 00:37:12.907
all of these words being uttered
over the course of this

00:37:12.907 --> 00:37:16.713
admittedly very long poem;
but with little ado [laughs]

00:37:16.713 --> 00:37:19.582
this just happens.
Milton suddenly and

00:37:19.582 --> 00:37:24.139
unexpectedly shatters all of our
assumptions.

00:37:24.139 --> 00:37:29.525
He tells us that everything
that we've read up to this point

00:37:29.525 --> 00:37:34.090
that has been spoken by a
third-person narrator.

00:37:34.090 --> 00:37:37.123
We didn't know this.
It has been spoken by the

00:37:37.123 --> 00:37:39.400
uncouth swain,
a rustic shepherd.

00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:42.876
Everything that we had thought
that Milton was telling us in

00:37:42.876 --> 00:37:45.409
the lyric present -- telling us
directly,

00:37:45.409 --> 00:37:51.493
now -- suddenly gets shoved
back into the narrative past:

00:37:51.493 --> 00:37:56.407
"thus sang the uncouth swain."
The past tense is important

00:37:56.407 --> 00:37:58.048
there.
This is the first moment,

00:37:58.048 --> 00:38:00.179
right now, "thus sang the
uncouth swain."

00:38:00.179 --> 00:38:02.867
This is the first moment that
the poet John Milton is actually

00:38:02.867 --> 00:38:05.291
speaking in his own voice,
and he's speaking directly to

00:38:05.291 --> 00:38:08.002
us.
We don't actually hear John

00:38:08.002 --> 00:38:12.719
Milton until we hear this line:
"Thus sang the uncouth

00:38:12.719 --> 00:38:15.993
swain."Well,
we should be shocked,

00:38:15.993 --> 00:38:20.744
and I think beyond that we have
every right to feel a little bit

00:38:20.744 --> 00:38:24.400
betrayed,
because Milton quite simply has

00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:28.747
-- and he's doing this
deliberately -- he has just

00:38:28.747 --> 00:38:33.175
violated an important law.
We could think of it as the

00:38:33.175 --> 00:38:37.159
contractual relation that a
writer makes with his reader.

00:38:37.159 --> 00:38:40.951
When there's a speaker of a
poem who is not to be confused

00:38:40.951 --> 00:38:44.278
with the poet himself,
there is typically a framing

00:38:44.278 --> 00:38:46.614
device.
You can easily imagine Milton

00:38:46.614 --> 00:38:49.328
employing a framing device here.
He could have begun

00:38:49.328 --> 00:38:51.572
"Lycidas" with this,
with something like a

00:38:51.572 --> 00:38:53.489
description of the uncouth
swain: "Oh,

00:38:53.489 --> 00:38:55.739
let me tell you about this
uncouth swain."

00:38:55.739 --> 00:38:59.354
Then he could tell us the
mournful lay that the uncouth

00:38:59.354 --> 00:39:03.103
swain sang, and then he could
say, "Thus sang the uncouth

00:39:03.103 --> 00:39:06.007
swain."
There would be an opening

00:39:06.007 --> 00:39:10.949
framing device and then,
of course, an end frame device.

00:39:10.949 --> 00:39:12.507
But Milton's framing device
[laughs]

00:39:12.507 --> 00:39:14.599
in "Lycidas" only frames the
end of the poem.

00:39:14.599 --> 00:39:18.101
It's asymmetrical.I think
we're fully entitled to ask why:

00:39:18.101 --> 00:39:21.545
why Milton waits for the last
eight lines of his poem to tell

00:39:21.545 --> 00:39:26.249
us that there's a difference,
that there's a difference

00:39:26.249 --> 00:39:30.070
between the poet and the
speaker.

00:39:30.070 --> 00:39:37.523
Why hadn't Milton pressed on
this possible distinction

00:39:37.523 --> 00:39:40.756
earlier?
The answer to the question,

00:39:40.756 --> 00:39:44.949
I think, gets at the very heart
of the meaning of this elegy.

00:39:44.949 --> 00:39:48.552
I think the answer may involve
the possibility that at the

00:39:48.552 --> 00:39:51.982
beginning of the poem,
there simply wasn't a clear

00:39:51.982 --> 00:39:55.239
distinction between the poet and
the speaker.

00:39:55.239 --> 00:39:58.632
It's as if the distinction
between John Milton and the

00:39:58.632 --> 00:40:02.090
speaker of "Lycidas"
wasn't really operative.

00:40:02.090 --> 00:40:06.947
There wasn't an uncouth swain
at the beginning.You'll

00:40:06.947 --> 00:40:11.804
remember that I mentioned
several minutes ago that Milton

00:40:11.804 --> 00:40:17.469
appears -- literary historians,
I think, have rightly seen the

00:40:17.469 --> 00:40:22.903
Milton who had written "Lycidas"
as a different figure than the

00:40:22.903 --> 00:40:26.409
poet before having written
"Lycidas."

00:40:26.409 --> 00:40:29.294
Milton seems to have
accomplished something in

00:40:29.294 --> 00:40:33.204
writing "Lycidas," almost
as if he accomplishes it over

00:40:33.204 --> 00:40:37.156
the course of this very poem;
and one of the things that he's

00:40:37.156 --> 00:40:40.710
accomplished is his ability to
see himself as someone who has

00:40:40.710 --> 00:40:43.949
accomplished something.
He's just written this poem.

00:40:43.949 --> 00:40:47.264
And instead of this continual
anticipation of writing

00:40:47.264 --> 00:40:50.197
something great,
Milton's able to look back and

00:40:50.197 --> 00:40:53.130
find closure in something
already written.

00:40:53.130 --> 00:40:58.102
At the very end of the poem,
the uncouth swain "rose,

00:40:58.102 --> 00:41:03.648
and twitch't his Mantle blue:
/ tomorrow to fresh Woods and

00:41:03.648 --> 00:41:07.094
Pastures new."
You get an image of Milton here

00:41:07.094 --> 00:41:10.041
twitching his blue mantle,
his cape over his shoulder,

00:41:10.041 --> 00:41:12.933
and dusting his hands and
letting us know that that's

00:41:12.933 --> 00:41:14.869
over.
He's finished.

00:41:14.869 --> 00:41:17.240
He has completed this lyric
poem.

00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:21.358
He's finished with his pastoral.
Perhaps, even,

00:41:21.358 --> 00:41:24.710
he has completed the youthful
phase of his literary

00:41:24.710 --> 00:41:28.264
career.Now we began
"Lycidas" with an image

00:41:28.264 --> 00:41:32.152
of a poet who could only write
this poem -- this is what we

00:41:32.152 --> 00:41:35.170
were told -- with forced fingers
rude.

00:41:35.170 --> 00:41:39.914
This was an act of compulsion,
and the poet had to be forced

00:41:39.914 --> 00:41:42.889
to press this lyric out of
himself.

00:41:42.889 --> 00:41:47.011
By the end of the poem we have
progressed from the image of

00:41:47.011 --> 00:41:51.275
"forc'd fingers rude" -- this is
an argument that's been made

00:41:51.275 --> 00:41:54.260
brilliantly by the critic Peter
Sacks,

00:41:54.260 --> 00:41:57.691
the author of a book called
The English Elegy --

00:41:57.691 --> 00:42:01.244
we've progressed from the
image of "forc'd fingers rude"

00:42:01.244 --> 00:42:04.555
to an image of the poet who
"touch't the tender stops of

00:42:04.555 --> 00:42:08.387
various Quills."
The poet's fingers by the end

00:42:08.387 --> 00:42:11.500
of "Lycidas" aren't forced or
rude.

00:42:11.500 --> 00:42:15.190
They're capable of these
extraordinarily delicate feats

00:42:15.190 --> 00:42:18.198
of dexterity,
and that's because the poet has

00:42:18.198 --> 00:42:21.224
mastered his touch.
This tactile mastery attests to

00:42:21.224 --> 00:42:23.944
something remarkable that's
happened over the course of the

00:42:23.944 --> 00:42:26.315
poem,
somewhere below the surface of

00:42:26.315 --> 00:42:28.909
the poem, somewhere between the
lines.

00:42:28.909 --> 00:42:34.677
Milton has mastered his poetic
touch, perhaps because Milton

00:42:34.677 --> 00:42:40.444
himself has been touched.Let
me remind you of that other

00:42:40.444 --> 00:42:45.803
intrusive moment in the poem,
the moment when a figure whose

00:42:45.803 --> 00:42:49.857
presence we hadn't been aware of
suddenly made -- suddenly

00:42:49.857 --> 00:42:52.432
asserted himself.
That was, of course,

00:42:52.432 --> 00:42:54.909
Phoebus Apollo,
the great god of the sun and

00:42:54.909 --> 00:42:59.202
the god of poetry,
who touched the trembling ears

00:42:59.202 --> 00:43:04.854
of the ambitious young Milton
much as he had a couple of

00:43:04.854 --> 00:43:10.506
centuries before touched the
ears of the ambitious young

00:43:10.506 --> 00:43:13.825
Virgil.
Apollo had touched Milton in a

00:43:13.825 --> 00:43:18.205
way that I think we can actually
measure by the end of this poem

00:43:18.205 --> 00:43:22.237
because Milton at the conclusion
of "Lycidas" seems to have

00:43:22.237 --> 00:43:27.059
assumed the authority of Apollo.
It's as if he's become Apollo

00:43:27.059 --> 00:43:30.860
as he himself takes over the
action of touching.

00:43:30.860 --> 00:43:33.652
The speaker has internalized
the authority of the god of

00:43:33.652 --> 00:43:37.333
poetry.
First he was touched and now he

00:43:37.333 --> 00:43:41.584
touches.
He touches the stops of various

00:43:41.584 --> 00:43:46.190
quills.
Look at the final lines: 

00:43:46.190 --> 00:43:49.255
And now the Sun had
stretch't out all the hills,

00:43:49.255 --> 00:43:51.460
And now was dropt into the
Western bay;

00:43:51.460 --> 00:43:54.779
At last he rose,
and [touched -- no:

00:43:54.779 --> 00:43:59.427
At last he rose and]
twitch't his Mantle blue:

00:43:59.427 --> 00:44:04.360
Tomorrow to fresh Woods,
and Pastures new.

00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:08.650
I'm interested in the temporal
clause "and now."

00:44:08.650 --> 00:44:12.187
Milton shows us he's fully
escaped from the repetitiveness

00:44:12.187 --> 00:44:14.360
of the "yet once
more"-beginning.

00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:18.322
This coda suggests something
like a victory over all of those

00:44:18.322 --> 00:44:22.284
worries of unpreparedness as the
worried rhetoric of "not yet

00:44:22.284 --> 00:44:26.247
there" gives way to a much more
confident language of present

00:44:26.247 --> 00:44:28.940
completion,
the "now."

00:44:28.940 --> 00:44:32.208
And now the Sun had
stretch't out all the hills,

00:44:32.208 --> 00:44:34.560
And now was dropt into the
Western bay;

00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:41.196
At last he rose…
[Laughs]

00:44:41.196 --> 00:44:48.580
"At last he rose":
at last who rose?

00:44:48.580 --> 00:44:51.276
Who rose?
The sun that was just dropped

00:44:51.276 --> 00:44:54.349
into the west or the uncouth
swain?

00:44:54.349 --> 00:44:57.044
This is my question to
you.Now we learn,

00:44:57.044 --> 00:45:00.740
of course, by the second half
of this line that it has to be

00:45:00.740 --> 00:45:04.500
the uncouth swain who rose and
twitched his mantle blue;

00:45:04.500 --> 00:45:09.271
but for a moment the "he" in
line 192 seems to be able to

00:45:09.271 --> 00:45:12.510
refer to either the poet or the
sun.

00:45:12.510 --> 00:45:15.240
Maybe it could refer to either
the poet or the sun throughout

00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:17.863
the entire line,
if you think of the mantle blue

00:45:17.863 --> 00:45:21.471
as being the actual sky that the
sun is able to twitch over his

00:45:21.471 --> 00:45:23.760
shoulder.
I don't know.

00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:26.148
It's at this point of a
possible confusion,

00:45:26.148 --> 00:45:28.594
at least a momentary,
provisional confusion,

00:45:28.594 --> 00:45:31.949
that we know that the poet has
identified with the sun.

00:45:31.949 --> 00:45:35.866
He's absorbed the touching
authority of Phoebus Apollo,

00:45:35.866 --> 00:45:39.880
the god of the sun.
Milton -- why is that important?

00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:44.469
Milton can no longer be chided
or be criticized by Phoebus

00:45:44.469 --> 00:45:48.093
because he's become
Phoebus.This momentary

00:45:48.093 --> 00:45:52.763
switch-off between the sun and
the poet is just one of this

00:45:52.763 --> 00:45:56.625
poem's many substitutions.
You saw earlier Saint Peter

00:45:56.625 --> 00:45:58.387
making a related set of
substitutions,

00:45:58.387 --> 00:46:00.779
and it was crazy.
Peter was lamenting Edward

00:46:00.779 --> 00:46:03.050
King's death,
and he claimed that he would

00:46:03.050 --> 00:46:05.930
gladly have spared an entire
slew of corrupt Anglican

00:46:05.930 --> 00:46:08.798
priests.
He would gladly have sacrificed

00:46:08.798 --> 00:46:12.957
them in order to keep the much
more virtuous and pure Lycidas

00:46:12.957 --> 00:46:16.490
-- a gruesome proposal,
but it's a gruesome proposal

00:46:16.490 --> 00:46:20.199
that suggests a primitive desire
for a quid pro quo.

00:46:20.199 --> 00:46:24.908
It's the same desire for some
kind of sacrificial substitution

00:46:24.908 --> 00:46:28.460
that, I think,
is fueling the poem's ending.

00:46:28.460 --> 00:46:31.977
The dynamic of the entire poem
is one of sacrifice and

00:46:31.977 --> 00:46:34.791
recompense.
Edward King gave his life,

00:46:34.791 --> 00:46:39.144
and he's recompensed by his new
status as the genius of the

00:46:39.144 --> 00:46:41.205
shore.
But John Milton is also

00:46:41.205 --> 00:46:43.977
recompensed and,
by the weird sacrificial logic

00:46:43.977 --> 00:46:47.110
that Saint Peter has already
sketched out for us,

00:46:47.110 --> 00:46:50.536
you can see a really [laughs]
disturbing way in which Milton

00:46:50.536 --> 00:46:54.255
has benefited as well.
It's as if Lycidas has died so

00:46:54.255 --> 00:46:57.900
that Milton could live to become
a great poet.

00:46:57.900 --> 00:47:02.633
Lycidas' untimely death seems
to enable Milton to master his

00:47:02.633 --> 00:47:06.124
own fears of untimeliness.
Lycidas' death -- remember this

00:47:06.124 --> 00:47:07.969
is the poem that Milton didn't
want to write,

00:47:07.969 --> 00:47:11.961
he was "forc'd" to write it --
Lycidas' death allows the

00:47:11.961 --> 00:47:15.010
uncouth swain to grow up and to
move on.

00:47:15.010 --> 00:47:20.198
The last eight lines announce
the course of this new poet's

00:47:20.198 --> 00:47:25.476
life -- announce the fact that
this poet's course in life is

00:47:25.476 --> 00:47:29.949
about to undergo a drastic
change.In fact,

00:47:29.949 --> 00:47:33.019
biographically this is what
happens to Milton.

00:47:33.019 --> 00:47:37.010
Finally, John Milton leaves his
father's house.

00:47:37.010 --> 00:47:39.516
He moves out and he goes on --
and of course,

00:47:39.516 --> 00:47:42.707
he's still being supported
quite generously by his father

00:47:42.707 --> 00:47:46.474
-- nonetheless,
he goes on an extended tour

00:47:46.474 --> 00:47:50.842
through France and Italy.
He manages to discard that

00:47:50.842 --> 00:47:54.545
youthful, that uncouth,
affection for chastity that had

00:47:54.545 --> 00:47:57.219
been such a part of his
imagination,

00:47:57.219 --> 00:48:01.340
and he marries a young woman
named Mary Powell.

00:48:01.340 --> 00:48:04.402
Now it's still going to be
another twenty-five years before

00:48:04.402 --> 00:48:07.585
Milton writes the great epic,
but Milton will no longer

00:48:07.585 --> 00:48:11.110
express the same degree of
anxiety about under-preparation

00:48:11.110 --> 00:48:14.387
to write the great epic.
In fact, this is an argument

00:48:14.387 --> 00:48:17.833
that's been made a number of
times, and I think there's a lot

00:48:17.833 --> 00:48:21.336
of sense to it -- the last eight
lines of "Lycidas" are

00:48:21.336 --> 00:48:24.896
written in a very specific line
form: the Italian scheme of the

00:48:24.896 --> 00:48:28.220
ottava rima.
It's the ottava rima in

00:48:28.220 --> 00:48:31.576
which all of the great Italian
romance epics by poets --

00:48:31.576 --> 00:48:35.236
favorite poets of Milton's like
Ariosto and Tasso -- had been

00:48:35.236 --> 00:48:37.884
written.
The appearance of this

00:48:37.884 --> 00:48:42.437
semi-epic rhyme scheme here at
the end of Milton's poem

00:48:42.437 --> 00:48:46.990
suggests his readiness,
and he's ready only here at the

00:48:46.990 --> 00:48:51.329
end of "Lycidas" to embark on
the epic project.Okay,

00:48:51.329 --> 00:48:57.036
quickly I'm going to ask you to
turn to the very beginning of

00:48:57.036 --> 00:49:00.460
"Lycidas," page 120 in the
Hughes.

00:49:00.460 --> 00:49:02.780
So "Lycidas" was
published along,

00:49:02.780 --> 00:49:05.041
as you know,
with the other poems about

00:49:05.041 --> 00:49:08.496
Edward King in 1637,
but Milton himself publishes

00:49:08.496 --> 00:49:12.550
the poem a second time in his
own volume of poems that he

00:49:12.550 --> 00:49:16.272
publishes in 1645.
It's for this second printing

00:49:16.272 --> 00:49:20.450
that Milton adds the headnote
that you see here that now

00:49:20.450 --> 00:49:23.641
begins the poem:
"In this Monody the Author

00:49:23.641 --> 00:49:28.413
bewails a learned Friend,
unfortunately drown'd in his

00:49:28.413 --> 00:49:32.599
Passage from Chester on the
Irish Seas, 1637."

00:49:32.599 --> 00:49:36.314
It's interesting that Milton
certainly begins this headnote

00:49:36.314 --> 00:49:40.092
with suggesting directly to us
that it's Milton speaking and

00:49:40.092 --> 00:49:45.327
not a fictional uncouth swain.
That aside, let me continue:

00:49:45.327 --> 00:49:48.530
"…
on the Irish Seas, 1637.

00:49:48.530 --> 00:49:52.463
And by occasion foretells the
ruin of our corrupted Clergy,

00:49:52.463 --> 00:49:56.125
then in their height."Eight
years after its initial

00:49:56.125 --> 00:49:58.726
composition,
Milton looks back at this

00:49:58.726 --> 00:50:01.578
elegy, rereads it,
and picks out the Saint Peter

00:50:01.578 --> 00:50:05.339
passage on the corrupted clergy
as that specific feature of the

00:50:05.339 --> 00:50:08.070
poem worth singling out and
introducing.

00:50:08.070 --> 00:50:10.659
Of course, in a lot of ways
this is just good marketing.

00:50:10.659 --> 00:50:14.209
Since the poem's initial
appearance, the institution of

00:50:14.209 --> 00:50:18.219
episcopacy, or church hierarchy,
has been seriously eroded.

00:50:18.219 --> 00:50:21.305
The first English civil war has
already broken out,

00:50:21.305 --> 00:50:24.824
setting Puritans like Milton
against the royalists and the

00:50:24.824 --> 00:50:27.909
supporters of the state control
of the church,

00:50:27.909 --> 00:50:32.208
like the king and like the
king's dread Archbishop of

00:50:32.208 --> 00:50:37.259
Canterbury, William Laud.
When Milton writes this little

00:50:37.259 --> 00:50:41.112
headnote in 1645,
Archbishop Laud has been

00:50:41.112 --> 00:50:43.847
executed.
He's been sacrificed to the

00:50:43.847 --> 00:50:46.321
Puritan cause.
And Milton reasonably alerts

00:50:46.321 --> 00:50:49.878
his reader to the timeliness of
a lot of the material that would

00:50:49.878 --> 00:50:53.436
be covered in this poem.But
this headnote goes a lot further

00:50:53.436 --> 00:50:56.090
simply than that:
"And by occasion foretells the

00:50:56.090 --> 00:51:00.610
ruin of our corrupted Clergy."
Milton is -- this is outrageous!

00:51:00.610 --> 00:51:04.195
He's actually claiming that
this poem had been prophetic,

00:51:04.195 --> 00:51:07.780
that "Lycidas" foretold
the ruin of the clergy.

00:51:07.780 --> 00:51:11.254
It's possible that Milton's
actually suggesting,

00:51:11.254 --> 00:51:15.320
I think, that this poem helped
bring that ruin about.

00:51:15.320 --> 00:51:18.249
You know that Milton had been
entertaining this fantasy of

00:51:18.249 --> 00:51:21.126
becoming a great biblical
prophet like Isaiah as early as

00:51:21.126 --> 00:51:23.786
the Nativity Ode.
He'd seen himself as a

00:51:23.786 --> 00:51:26.803
Jeremiah or as an Isaiah,
and there were all those early

00:51:26.803 --> 00:51:31.140
gestures of prophecy.
But now he's able to tell us

00:51:31.140 --> 00:51:35.239
that he has already become
prophetic.

00:51:35.239 --> 00:51:38.628
He throws his high prophetic
talents into the construction of

00:51:38.628 --> 00:51:41.078
the Saint Peter speech;
and in 1645,

00:51:41.078 --> 00:51:44.971
historical circumstances being
what they were,

00:51:44.971 --> 00:51:49.988
he was able to look back at
this passage and actually claim

00:51:49.988 --> 00:51:54.659
that it had been a genuinely
prophetic utterance.

00:51:54.659 --> 00:51:57.613
He's made good on all of his
promises.Of course,

00:51:57.613 --> 00:52:00.219
it's a sleazy move for Milton
to have made,

00:52:00.219 --> 00:52:03.283
to claim [laughs]
that he had actually

00:52:03.283 --> 00:52:07.340
prophesied, let's say,
the execution of Archbishop

00:52:07.340 --> 00:52:11.397
Laud -- but Milton will
capitalize and exploit any

00:52:11.397 --> 00:52:16.696
evidence he can possibly find to
assure himself that he is on the

00:52:16.696 --> 00:52:21.498
appropriate path to become the
great prophetic poet that he

00:52:21.498 --> 00:52:26.466
knows he is entitled to become
and that he has been chosen to

00:52:26.466 --> 00:52:30.722
become.
Finally, Milton has revised and

00:52:30.722 --> 00:52:36.000
undone the anticipatory logic of
the great career narrative.

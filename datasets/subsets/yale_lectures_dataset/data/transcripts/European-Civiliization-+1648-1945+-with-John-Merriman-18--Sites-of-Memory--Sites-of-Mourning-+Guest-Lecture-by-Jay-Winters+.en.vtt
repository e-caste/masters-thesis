00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:07.963
Prof: What I'd like to
do today is to talk to you about

00:00:07.963 --> 00:00:14.114
what it is that distinguishes
European ideas about the shared

00:00:14.114 --> 00:00:19.650
history of the last century and
the United States.

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.000
What makes Europe European and
what makes its sense of history

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.930
different from ours.
 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:32.439
I think the primary difference
between Europe and the United

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:36.270
States will be seen in about six
days,

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.860
on the 11^(th) of November,
when Armistice Day is

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.390
commemorated all over Europe.
 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.150
In fact, it's now commemorated
in Eastern Europe as well as in

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.971
Western Europe,
since it took the fall of the

00:00:48.971 --> 00:00:52.100
Soviet Union to remind people
that two million Russian

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.520
soldiers died in the First World
War,

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.628
and that the Eastern Front was
the place where the German army

00:00:58.628 --> 00:01:02.466
won the war and where the
Russian Revolution came directly

00:01:02.466 --> 00:01:03.408
out of it.
 

00:01:03.408 --> 00:01:06.858
So, the First World War is what
made Europe in the twentieth

00:01:06.858 --> 00:01:07.968
century European.
 

00:01:07.968 --> 00:01:14.727
And the war created a series of
wounds that, to a degree,

00:01:14.727 --> 00:01:18.709
have never healed,
to a degree.

00:01:18.709 --> 00:01:21.747
The primary reason for that is
the bloodshed,

00:01:21.747 --> 00:01:25.958
is the staggering casualties of
a degree and magnitude that no

00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:27.959
one had ever seen before.
 

00:01:27.959 --> 00:01:32.601
When we talk about losses on
the scale of the First World

00:01:32.601 --> 00:01:35.420
War, we enter a surreal terrain.
 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.935
I have great difficulty getting
my mind around figures of one

00:01:39.935 --> 00:01:43.171
million casualties for the
Battle of Verdun,

00:01:43.171 --> 00:01:45.510
in 1916,
or just about the same number

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:46.870
for the Battle of the Somme.
 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:50.066
The Battle of Verdun between
February 1916 and November was

00:01:50.066 --> 00:01:51.830
the longest battle in history.
 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:53.239
It was ten months without a
break.

00:01:53.239 --> 00:01:55.530
There was nothing like it in
the Second World War.

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.376
It pushed soldiers,
human beings,

00:01:57.376 --> 00:01:59.629
beyond the limits of human
endurance.

00:01:59.629 --> 00:02:05.713
The primary way in which this
wound has been remembered is in

00:02:05.713 --> 00:02:10.682
terms of an array of
commemorative practices which

00:02:10.682 --> 00:02:16.159
describe what European identity
is, not only was,

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:17.060
but is.
 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.645
I want to suggest that there
are many reasons why the

00:02:19.645 --> 00:02:22.729
remembrance of the First World
War is carried on throughout the

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:24.720
twentieth century in a defining
way.

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.348
The first is technology.
 

00:02:27.348 --> 00:02:31.937
It's an accident that the First
World War happened at the very

00:02:31.937 --> 00:02:36.376
moment that the film industry
became the centerpiece of mass

00:02:36.376 --> 00:02:37.729
entertainment.
 

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:41.740
Hence, this was the very first
filmic war.

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:45.348
It was filmic in a fictional
way.

00:02:45.348 --> 00:02:47.982
That is to say,
the technology of the day

00:02:47.982 --> 00:02:51.402
provided motion picture cameras
for all major armies,

00:02:51.402 --> 00:02:54.758
and indeed they were used in
all kinds of ways.

00:02:54.758 --> 00:02:57.848
The problem was they never
filmed battle,

00:02:57.848 --> 00:03:00.319
or almost never filmed battle.
 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:01.580
There are one or two exceptions.
 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.501
But the important point is that
generals and their staffs didn't

00:03:05.501 --> 00:03:10.306
want cameras on the battlefield,
partly because it might produce

00:03:10.306 --> 00:03:14.460
evidence that would be useful to
the other side.

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:19.180
The other part of it is that
the film might get back home.

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.500
If families got to see it,
then what would happen?

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.292
There's a famous story of the
fictional film representation of

00:03:27.292 --> 00:03:31.613
war which is one reason why I
think it is so iconic as a

00:03:31.613 --> 00:03:36.720
descriptive element in European
consciousness about the past.

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.763
In 1916, in the middle of the
Battle of the Somme--which was a

00:03:40.763 --> 00:03:44.674
six-month quagmire started by
the British army on the 1st of

00:03:44.674 --> 00:03:47.788
July 1916 and ended roughly
November 1916,

00:03:47.788 --> 00:03:51.283
for no gain whatsoever and a
million casualties--in the

00:03:51.283 --> 00:03:54.777
middle of it,
a part of the British

00:03:54.777 --> 00:03:59.053
propaganda office,
it wasn't a ministry until

00:03:59.053 --> 00:04:03.587
1918--it was all done more or
less informally until then--they

00:04:03.587 --> 00:04:07.378
decided to make a film to buck
up public morale.

00:04:07.378 --> 00:04:10.857
What they did was they filmed
the Battle of the Somme while it

00:04:10.857 --> 00:04:11.938
was being fought.
 

00:04:11.938 --> 00:04:13.538
But they didn't film the
fighting.

00:04:13.538 --> 00:04:18.649
They filmed mock episodes where
soldiers in training would go

00:04:18.649 --> 00:04:23.759
over the top in a totally
fictional representation of war.

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:29.235
The problem was that the people
who saw this didn't know that it

00:04:29.235 --> 00:04:30.278
was phony.
 

00:04:30.278 --> 00:04:34.600
When the film was shown in the
middle of 1916,

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.826
in August-September 1916--the
battle started on the 1^(st) of

00:04:37.826 --> 00:04:39.870
July--it was shown all over
Britain.

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:43.339
Twenty million people saw it.
 

00:04:43.339 --> 00:04:46.629
That is half of the population
of the country.

00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:50.411
There has never been a film
that was seen by half of the

00:04:50.411 --> 00:04:55.019
population of any country in the
world before that date or since.

00:04:55.019 --> 00:04:57.930
It broke all box office records.
 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:01.348
What it showed in silence was
the preparation for the battle,

00:05:01.348 --> 00:05:04.423
the huge artillery barrage,
and then men going over the

00:05:04.423 --> 00:05:04.879
top.
 

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:07.600
Because of this phony--there
were men who went over the top,

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.040
stopped for a moment and then
slid right down again,

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:13.778
which caused women in the
theaters that saw that to faint.

00:05:13.778 --> 00:05:17.005
They didn't know that this was
simply nonsense,

00:05:17.005 --> 00:05:18.550
that it was fiction.
 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:21.427
I think the critical point to
bear in mind,

00:05:21.427 --> 00:05:25.675
therefore, is that as a filmic
war, the war turned into myth at

00:05:25.675 --> 00:05:28.759
the very moment that it was
being fought.

00:05:28.759 --> 00:05:32.677
Nobody had ever seen the
landscape of the dark side of

00:05:32.677 --> 00:05:37.038
the moon that was created by
industrialized war between 1914

00:05:37.038 --> 00:05:38.000
and 1918.
 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.860
The way it was represented by
film was completely fictional.

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.259
Film comes straight out of
theater.

00:05:45.259 --> 00:05:47.720
It has a proscenium arch and it
has a vanishing point.

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:50.875
Anyone who's ever been anywhere
near a battle will realize that

00:05:50.875 --> 00:05:52.810
battles don't have vanishing
points.

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:54.725
People vanish in them,
but they go in every

00:05:54.725 --> 00:05:55.819
conceivable direction.
 

00:05:55.819 --> 00:06:00.437
The representation of war
became a matter of myth right in

00:06:00.437 --> 00:06:02.949
the middle of the war itself.
 

00:06:02.949 --> 00:06:05.519
It became a battle of myth to
be remembered.

00:06:05.519 --> 00:06:09.906
I'll give you another example
which makes the point really

00:06:09.906 --> 00:06:12.370
powerful, very,
very powerful.

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:16.617
In February 1916 the German
army decided to push through

00:06:16.617 --> 00:06:18.550
French lines at Verdun.
 

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:21.427
This big ten-month battle,
which is the biggest of all

00:06:21.427 --> 00:06:22.459
time, took place.
 

00:06:22.459 --> 00:06:26.281
In the course of it a series of
completely made-up stories

00:06:26.281 --> 00:06:27.689
turned into legend.
 

00:06:27.689 --> 00:06:29.759
One is called the Trench of the
Bayonets.

00:06:29.759 --> 00:06:32.776
What it shows is there were no
trenches in the Battle of

00:06:32.776 --> 00:06:33.269
Verdun.
 

00:06:33.269 --> 00:06:35.810
There were isolated pockets of
men in big underground forts.

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:38.524
There was simply artillery
barrage going on day and night

00:06:38.524 --> 00:06:39.350
for ten months.
 

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:42.091
Little pockets of men would be
caught in one part of the

00:06:42.091 --> 00:06:45.182
battle, and they stayed put to
make sure that the Germans would

00:06:45.182 --> 00:06:46.180
not get through.
 

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:49.170
The French line was in ils
ne passeront pas.

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:50.800
They won't get through and they
didn't.

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:54.547
One group of such men were
almost certainly buried by a

00:06:54.547 --> 00:06:55.379
landslide.
 

00:06:55.379 --> 00:06:59.454
The weight of artillery barrage
in the mud would mean the earth

00:06:59.454 --> 00:07:01.230
would move when,
indeed,

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:05.228
the artillery barrage hit a
particularly wet part of the

00:07:05.228 --> 00:07:05.810
front.
 

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:09.293
So, a group of men were buried
alive, which is a very normal

00:07:09.293 --> 00:07:12.129
practice in the course of the
First World War.

00:07:12.129 --> 00:07:16.160
The German group of soldiers,
the platoon that took it,

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:20.088
put bayonets basically sticking
up out of the ground to indicate

00:07:20.088 --> 00:07:22.769
to the Frenchmen where to find
the dead,

00:07:22.769 --> 00:07:26.420
so that they could be buried
during a lull in the fighting.

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:29.339
The French didn't interpret it
that way.

00:07:29.339 --> 00:07:31.994
What they said was,
"Here are fifteen French

00:07:31.994 --> 00:07:34.870
men who stood with their
bayonets there until they were

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:38.067
buried alive and they didn't
move an inch in the passeront

00:07:38.067 --> 00:07:39.079
pas."
 

00:07:39.079 --> 00:07:42.040
This is a completely made up
story.

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:48.213
But it became a sacred site
commemorated every 22^(nd) of

00:07:48.213 --> 00:07:51.190
February 1917,1918,
1919.

00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:53.509
In other words,
the war itself created a mythic

00:07:53.509 --> 00:07:56.184
set of representations of war
that have come up to the

00:07:56.184 --> 00:07:56.790
present.
 

00:07:56.790 --> 00:08:00.519
The Great War created myth in
other ways.

00:08:00.519 --> 00:08:03.709
Another one came from the
landing in Gallipoli.

00:08:03.709 --> 00:08:08.502
Gallipoli was a Turkish
peninsula south of Istanbul,

00:08:08.502 --> 00:08:10.569
Constantinople then.
 

00:08:10.569 --> 00:08:13.459
It's about a four-hour taxi
drive in lousy traffic.

00:08:13.459 --> 00:08:14.970
It probably took longer then.
 

00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:18.540
The idea of the Allies was to
knock Turkey out of the war,

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:21.612
help Russia and possibly
encircle Germany by not

00:08:21.612 --> 00:08:24.750
attacking directly through the
western front,

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:26.819
but coming around through Asia
Minor.

00:08:26.819 --> 00:08:31.129
This landing was a catastrophic
failure.

00:08:31.129 --> 00:08:33.807
It was the brainchild of
Winston Churchill who,

00:08:33.807 --> 00:08:37.066
until 1940 when Hitler made him
the great man that we all

00:08:37.066 --> 00:08:39.220
remember, was a complete
failure.

00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:41.340
politically and in military
affairs.

00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:45.623
Gallipoli was his idea,
and he shared in the form of

00:08:45.623 --> 00:08:51.533
what is now called Orientalism,
a complete underestimation of

00:08:51.533 --> 00:08:55.009
the capacity of Muslim
populations,

00:08:55.009 --> 00:08:57.110
Asian populations,
brown people,

00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:58.480
to fight against Europeans.
 

00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:01.285
So, nobody had a look at the
ground where the Allies were

00:09:01.285 --> 00:09:02.889
supposed to land at Gallipoli.
 

00:09:02.889 --> 00:09:06.436
They didn't actually take
account of the fact that there

00:09:06.436 --> 00:09:08.500
were very big cliffs to climb.
 

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:10.826
When they got there,
they just reproduced trench

00:09:10.826 --> 00:09:12.559
warfare that had already
existed.

00:09:12.559 --> 00:09:13.990
It was a complete failure.
 

00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:19.302
The landing, though,
took place on the night of the

00:09:19.302 --> 00:09:24.336
25^(th) of April 1915,
and the people used for it were

00:09:24.336 --> 00:09:26.908
Australian and New Zealand
troops,

00:09:26.908 --> 00:09:28.740
alongside British and French
ones.

00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:33.120
That landing was the birth of
the Australian nation.

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:35.972
To this day,
Anzac Day--Australia,

00:09:35.972 --> 00:09:40.730
New Zealand Expeditionary
Corps--Anzac Day is sacred.

00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:44.519
It's the 4^(th) of July in
Australia.

00:09:44.519 --> 00:09:47.320
It's the moment of celebration,
through the shedding of blood,

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:48.788
the winning of national pride.
 

00:09:48.788 --> 00:09:52.458
The point I'm trying to make
initially is that remembering

00:09:52.458 --> 00:09:55.806
the First World War is
remembering sacred themes that

00:09:55.806 --> 00:09:57.029
define nations.
 

00:09:57.029 --> 00:10:00.427
The oddity of the First World
War is that these nations were

00:10:00.427 --> 00:10:03.538
defined first of all because
they're a part of imperial

00:10:03.538 --> 00:10:06.192
powers,
but this war was at the one and

00:10:06.192 --> 00:10:10.370
the same time the apogee and the
beginning and the end of empire.

00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:13.607
Hence, nations that affirm
their loyalty to Britain by

00:10:13.607 --> 00:10:15.870
dying on the beaches of
Gallipoli,

00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:19.485
or in the hills of Gallipoli,
earned the right to break away

00:10:19.485 --> 00:10:20.428
from Britain.
 

00:10:20.428 --> 00:10:25.610
This sacred moment is how the
Great War turned into myth.

00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:30.690
If you think this is light,
you're mistaken.

00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:34.269
This is big-time politics to
this day.

00:10:34.269 --> 00:10:37.649
Yesterday, in the Sydney
Morning Herald,

00:10:37.649 --> 00:10:40.917
two Australian politicians
virtually came to blows about

00:10:40.917 --> 00:10:44.615
how to remember Gallipoli,
because it is at the core of

00:10:44.615 --> 00:10:48.570
the notion or of the idea of
what the nation has to be.

00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:52.024
The first point I want to make
is remembering the First World

00:10:52.024 --> 00:10:54.269
War is remembering a series of
myths.

00:10:54.269 --> 00:10:57.168
They're iconic in the sense
that they describe not just what

00:10:57.168 --> 00:11:01.226
happened at a particular moment,
but they describe what the rest

00:11:01.226 --> 00:11:05.298
of the twentieth century might
become and did become.

00:11:05.298 --> 00:11:08.008
And that is the second point I
think I'd like to draw to your

00:11:08.008 --> 00:11:08.548
attention.
 

00:11:08.548 --> 00:11:12.173
What makes remembering the
First World War so important is

00:11:12.173 --> 00:11:15.990
that it became the way in which
war was configured throughout

00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:18.278
the twentieth century in Europe.
 

00:11:18.278 --> 00:11:21.136
In many respects,
this is a defining difference

00:11:21.136 --> 00:11:23.558
between the United States and
Europe.

00:11:23.558 --> 00:11:27.149
The Second World War in this
country is quite different from

00:11:27.149 --> 00:11:27.879
the First.
 

00:11:27.879 --> 00:11:32.966
The United States didn't really
suffer the injuries of any major

00:11:32.966 --> 00:11:36.360
European country in the First
World War.

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:40.947
One hundred thousand American
soldiers died in the First World

00:11:40.947 --> 00:11:41.399
War.
 

00:11:41.399 --> 00:11:43.625
Perhaps 40,000 of them,
and there's a dispute on this,

00:11:43.625 --> 00:11:45.811
but perhaps 40,000 of them died
from the Spanish Flu,

00:11:45.811 --> 00:11:47.659
the worst influenza epidemic in
history.

00:11:47.659 --> 00:11:48.679
It hit everybody.
 

00:11:48.679 --> 00:11:49.730
It hit civilians.
 

00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:50.840
It hit soldiers.
 

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:54.691
But it particularly preyed,
as many mutant viruses do,

00:11:54.691 --> 00:11:56.000
on young adults.
 

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.600
So, it got soldiers.
 

00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:00.485
Well, 100,000 dead was roughly,
just roughly,

00:12:00.485 --> 00:12:04.486
what the British army suffered
in three weeks on the Battle of

00:12:04.486 --> 00:12:06.389
the Somme, in one battle.
 

00:12:06.389 --> 00:12:10.999
The scale of casualties in the
First World War is what makes it

00:12:10.999 --> 00:12:12.710
everybody's business.
 

00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:15.278
The second reason why
remembering the First World War

00:12:15.278 --> 00:12:17.549
is iconic is that it is
universal in Europe.

00:12:17.549 --> 00:12:19.058
It's family history.
 

00:12:19.058 --> 00:12:22.509
Let me give you an example of
what that means.

00:12:22.509 --> 00:12:26.695
If you ever visit the
extraordinary power of

00:12:26.695 --> 00:12:31.756
individual graveyards at the
scene of the landings at

00:12:31.756 --> 00:12:35.095
Normandy,
you will find that there are

00:12:35.095 --> 00:12:38.975
graves of 3,000 American
soldiers who died in the course

00:12:38.975 --> 00:12:43.350
of the first day of the landing
on the 6^(th) of June 1944.

00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:47.110
That landing on the 6^(th) of
June 1944 was terrible.

00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:49.519
It was an extraordinary day.
 

00:12:49.519 --> 00:12:53.100
It was a day that should be
remembered and is remembered.

00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:57.961
If any of you see the Steven
Spielberg film Saving Private

00:12:57.961 --> 00:13:00.070
Ryan, you'll see it.
 

00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:01.029
It is iconic.
 

00:13:01.029 --> 00:13:01.960
It should be.
 

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:06.708
The first day of the Battle of
the Somme, on the 1^(st) of July

00:13:06.708 --> 00:13:09.620
1916, was 20,000 British men
killed.

00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:14.366
The first day of the landing at
Normandy, 3,000 Americans

00:13:14.366 --> 00:13:15.129
killed.
 

00:13:15.129 --> 00:13:18.553
The landing at Normandy,
compared to the Battle of the

00:13:18.553 --> 00:13:20.899
Somme,
shows us that the iconic battle

00:13:20.899 --> 00:13:24.634
for Britain of the First World
War was six times as murderous

00:13:24.634 --> 00:13:27.250
in one day as the landings at
Normandy.

00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:32.065
That sheer scale of casualties
means that remembering the Great

00:13:32.065 --> 00:13:36.337
War means remembering loss of
life that became universal

00:13:36.337 --> 00:13:39.950
throughout families,
throughout Europe.

00:13:39.950 --> 00:13:42.288
This is extraordinary in many
respects.

00:13:42.288 --> 00:13:46.279
Until 1914, war was not
democratic.

00:13:46.279 --> 00:13:49.330
Military service was not
democratic.

00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:53.154
Either it was aristocratic and
rural, in terms of the officer

00:13:53.154 --> 00:13:56.279
corps, that's why the cavalry
mattered so much.

00:13:56.279 --> 00:13:57.558
They came from the land.
 

00:13:57.558 --> 00:14:02.953
Or it was more or less the men
whom the general who defeated

00:14:02.953 --> 00:14:05.879
Napoleon, Wellington,
put it,

00:14:05.879 --> 00:14:07.259
who were "the scum of the
earth."

00:14:07.259 --> 00:14:12.578
Either the unemployable
overpopulation of major cities,

00:14:12.578 --> 00:14:17.899
or indeed the unemployable
populations of rural life in

00:14:17.899 --> 00:14:19.870
Europe, as well.
 

00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:23.428
Now, what happens in 1914 is
conscription,

00:14:23.428 --> 00:14:27.607
universal conscription
antedating the war presented

00:14:27.607 --> 00:14:32.788
armies of a size that had never
before been pulled together.

00:14:32.788 --> 00:14:37.980
These armies suffered
casualties of roughly one out of

00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:42.288
eight killed and one out of
three wounded.

00:14:42.288 --> 00:14:46.950
We're talking about seventy
million men in uniform in the

00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:50.278
First World War,
nine million men killed,

00:14:50.278 --> 00:14:53.940
roughly twenty-five million men
wounded.

00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:57.229
One out of every two men who
served in the First World War

00:14:57.229 --> 00:14:58.210
was a casualty.
 

00:14:58.210 --> 00:15:00.250
There were eight million
prisoners of war.

00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:04.840
In those camps illness was
likely to kill you more than

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:06.200
anything else.
 

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:09.279
The critical thing to bear in
mind, therefore,

00:15:09.279 --> 00:15:12.908
is that the First World War
created an astonishing and

00:15:12.908 --> 00:15:15.990
unprecedented challenge of
commemoration.

00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:19.720
The first challenge was the
missing.

00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:23.008
I want to take you through the
commemorative forms that the

00:15:23.008 --> 00:15:25.807
First World War created,
which created cultural

00:15:25.807 --> 00:15:28.519
practices that are still very
important today.

00:15:28.519 --> 00:15:32.125
Anybody going to England
today--and I mean today,

00:15:32.125 --> 00:15:36.107
I was there last weekend in
Oxford--will see everybody

00:15:36.107 --> 00:15:39.490
wearing a little red poppy in
your lapel.

00:15:39.490 --> 00:15:42.908
This is what you buy for a
couple of pennies,

00:15:42.908 --> 00:15:45.809
whatever you want to give as a
contribution to a charity called

00:15:45.809 --> 00:15:48.548
The Royal British Legion,
the biggest charity in Britain.

00:15:48.548 --> 00:15:51.816
It is still to this day the
biggest charity for those

00:15:51.816 --> 00:15:54.019
families,
and indeed survivors,

00:15:54.019 --> 00:15:57.626
and successive generations of
those who served their country

00:15:57.626 --> 00:15:59.889
and who were wounded or died in
it.

00:15:59.889 --> 00:16:03.389
The critical thing to bear in
mind about this is that the

00:16:03.389 --> 00:16:06.730
mythic representation of war,
which came out of film,

00:16:06.730 --> 00:16:09.835
has been matched by what I
would call a family

00:16:09.835 --> 00:16:14.044
representation of war that comes
through cultural practices of

00:16:14.044 --> 00:16:15.149
remembrance.
 

00:16:15.149 --> 00:16:19.035
We should never ever get away
from the fact that remembering

00:16:19.035 --> 00:16:20.090
is a business.
 

00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:21.750
People make money out of it.
 

00:16:21.750 --> 00:16:24.788
That's why films sell so well.
 

00:16:24.788 --> 00:16:28.950
The History Channel is
dominated by stories about war.

00:16:28.950 --> 00:16:32.062
It's an important thing to bear
in mind that people make money

00:16:32.062 --> 00:16:33.389
out of representing war.
 

00:16:33.389 --> 00:16:35.690
It's an important thing to keep
in mind.

00:16:35.690 --> 00:16:39.265
But that's too cynical to
suffice for a discussion of how

00:16:39.265 --> 00:16:41.629
the First World War was
remembered.

00:16:41.629 --> 00:16:44.830
It was remembered and still is
remembered within families.

00:16:44.830 --> 00:16:46.788
The answer to "Why is
that?"

00:16:46.788 --> 00:16:49.509
It's because of the
universalization of bereavement.

00:16:49.509 --> 00:16:51.529
What's the problem?
 

00:16:51.529 --> 00:16:52.679
The problems are threefold.
 

00:16:52.679 --> 00:16:54.308
The first is the missing.
 

00:16:54.308 --> 00:16:56.095
The second is,
in some sense,

00:16:56.095 --> 00:16:59.538
the irrelevance of conventional
religious practices.

00:16:59.538 --> 00:17:02.711
The third is the search for
some kind of collective

00:17:02.711 --> 00:17:04.869
statement of why these men died.
 

00:17:04.869 --> 00:17:05.920
For what?
 

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:07.630
What price, victory?
 

00:17:07.630 --> 00:17:09.108
The missing.
 

00:17:09.108 --> 00:17:12.247
Half of those men who died in
the First World War,

00:17:12.247 --> 00:17:15.704
and we're talking about nine
million men, have no known

00:17:15.704 --> 00:17:16.410
graves.
 

00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:19.380
Not a trace of them exists.
 

00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:23.327
This, by the way,
is exactly the same proportion

00:17:23.327 --> 00:17:27.528
of those who were killed at
Ground Zero on 9-11.

00:17:27.528 --> 00:17:30.230
Half of them have vanished
completely.

00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:35.170
There are traces that matter a
great deal to the families of

00:17:35.170 --> 00:17:38.184
the survivors,
the survivors who need

00:17:38.184 --> 00:17:41.200
something to remember,
to mourn.

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:45.505
The fact that roughly four
million men died without a trace

00:17:45.505 --> 00:17:48.920
made commemorating war very,
very difficult.

00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:52.517
Conventional religious
practices require a site,

00:17:52.517 --> 00:17:55.667
a grave,
a place to go to where

00:17:55.667 --> 00:18:02.279
individuals can honor those who
die and take their lives up once

00:18:02.279 --> 00:18:05.118
again,
let the loss go.

00:18:05.118 --> 00:18:08.789
What possible ways do they have
to handle this?

00:18:08.789 --> 00:18:10.390
During the war, nothing.
 

00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:13.615
Because the confusion over
casualties of war,

00:18:13.615 --> 00:18:17.430
which always happens in
wartime, was overwhelming.

00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:19.848
If a family got a message
saying,

00:18:19.848 --> 00:18:21.380
"Your husband,"
"Your brother,"

00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:22.757
"Your son,"
"Your fiancé

00:18:22.757 --> 00:18:24.440
is missing in action,"
it could mean anything.

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:28.367
It could mean that the
individual was in a prison camp

00:18:28.367 --> 00:18:30.740
on the other side of the line.
 

00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:32.798
It could mean that the
individual was in a hospital.

00:18:32.798 --> 00:18:36.480
It could mean that there was a
confusion of identity and that

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:40.038
the person was still alive,
but somebody else found his dog

00:18:40.038 --> 00:18:40.529
tag.
 

00:18:40.529 --> 00:18:43.605
It could mean that the person
had been blown to pieces and

00:18:43.605 --> 00:18:45.818
there was nothing that remained
of him.

00:18:45.818 --> 00:18:47.810
None of that could be sorted
until the end of the war,

00:18:47.810 --> 00:18:49.390
and even then it couldn't be
sorted out.

00:18:49.390 --> 00:18:53.339
The loss of knowledge,
the lack of knowledge about the

00:18:53.339 --> 00:18:56.663
most fundamental question of war
is the most poignant origin of a

00:18:56.663 --> 00:18:59.470
series of commemorative
practices that followed it.

00:18:59.470 --> 00:19:04.622
Given the scale of the losses,
the conventional churches were

00:19:04.622 --> 00:19:08.553
not able to handle the problem
of helping the bereaved or those

00:19:08.553 --> 00:19:11.279
who were, as it were,
in no man's land,

00:19:11.279 --> 00:19:12.519
in Purgatory.
 

00:19:12.519 --> 00:19:15.250
In fact, Purgatory is an
interesting idea.

00:19:15.250 --> 00:19:18.041
If you think about it,
it's centered to a certain kind

00:19:18.041 --> 00:19:20.730
of popular Catholicism in the
nineteenth century.

00:19:20.730 --> 00:19:25.163
Purgatory means that people who
are on the way to heaven have to

00:19:25.163 --> 00:19:27.140
wait a while,
and maybe,

00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:29.619
maybe just the good works that
you and I might do will help

00:19:29.619 --> 00:19:31.549
them get there sooner,
rather than later.

00:19:31.549 --> 00:19:32.450
It's a medieval idea.
 

00:19:32.450 --> 00:19:35.608
The Catholic Church had to
jettison the idea of Purgatory,

00:19:35.608 --> 00:19:37.348
which died in the First World
War,

00:19:37.348 --> 00:19:40.396
because no one wanted to put up
with the idea that an individual

00:19:40.396 --> 00:19:43.395
who died for his country had to
wait for 100 years in Purgatory

00:19:43.395 --> 00:19:45.380
in order to be able to get to
heaven.

00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:48.527
Religious practices had to
change to handle the

00:19:48.527 --> 00:19:50.578
unprecedented losses of war.
 

00:19:50.578 --> 00:19:53.874
Those who went to the churches
for solace found very little,

00:19:53.874 --> 00:19:56.778
because there was very little
the churchmen could do,

00:19:56.778 --> 00:19:57.559
could say.
 

00:19:57.559 --> 00:19:59.869
Why did I lose three sons?
 

00:19:59.869 --> 00:20:01.460
What did they die for?
 

00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:04.413
The phrases,
the noble phrases of patriotism

00:20:04.413 --> 00:20:07.712
last only so long,
and most of the time don't get

00:20:07.712 --> 00:20:09.500
you through the night.
 

00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:12.130
Well, what did individuals do?
 

00:20:12.130 --> 00:20:15.905
The first thing they did was to
move to the pagan perimeters of

00:20:15.905 --> 00:20:16.818
Christianity.
 

00:20:16.818 --> 00:20:21.544
John Merriman referred you to a
wonderful film by Abel Gance

00:20:21.544 --> 00:20:25.307
about the return of the dead
called J'Accuse,

00:20:25.307 --> 00:20:27.900
I Accuse,
which is accusing war,

00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:29.630
accusing the sun of not
stopping war.

00:20:29.630 --> 00:20:33.920
It's accusing everybody of this
insanity that had no end to it.

00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:40.553
Well, the pagan perimeters of
Christianity are the areas where

00:20:40.553 --> 00:20:42.618
the occult lives.
 

00:20:42.618 --> 00:20:46.463
It's the areas where people
believe, faute de mieux,

00:20:46.463 --> 00:20:50.308
because they have no choice in
extra sensory perception.

00:20:50.308 --> 00:20:54.063
This is a period not just of
the film industry,

00:20:54.063 --> 00:20:56.430
but the emergence of radio.
 

00:20:56.430 --> 00:21:01.115
It's a world where telegraphy
was a quite normal means of

00:21:01.115 --> 00:21:04.295
communication,
with underground cables,

00:21:04.295 --> 00:21:08.480
Reuters dispatched stories all
over the world.

00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:12.339
For millions of families the
idea of getting in touch with

00:21:12.339 --> 00:21:15.660
the missing or the dead seemed
quite appealing.

00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:17.598
These are not fools.
 

00:21:17.598 --> 00:21:21.270
These are not people who are,
as it were, bought by the Elmer

00:21:21.270 --> 00:21:22.740
Gantrys of this world.
 

00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:26.035
These are ordinary people or
very intelligent people who are

00:21:26.035 --> 00:21:29.442
prepared to suspend disbelief
about extrasensory perception in

00:21:29.442 --> 00:21:31.788
order to be able to find some
solace,

00:21:31.788 --> 00:21:34.730
some way of understanding the
world in which they live.

00:21:34.730 --> 00:21:37.574
There was an extraordinary
efflorescence,

00:21:37.574 --> 00:21:41.058
development of spiritualism,
of séances.

00:21:41.058 --> 00:21:45.299
One of the great carriers of
this message was Arthur Conan

00:21:45.299 --> 00:21:50.061
Doyle, who was the author of the
great, the ultimate rationalist,

00:21:50.061 --> 00:21:51.548
Sherlock Holmes.
 

00:21:51.548 --> 00:21:54.902
When his son died and was
missing, completely missing,

00:21:54.902 --> 00:21:58.382
he became one of the great
figures in the development of

00:21:58.382 --> 00:22:00.278
the spiritualist movement.
 

00:22:00.278 --> 00:22:03.561
Churches have no part in that
because speaking to the dead has

00:22:03.561 --> 00:22:04.368
no mediation.
 

00:22:04.368 --> 00:22:07.660
Christianity couldn't be
interested in this.

00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:09.548
Jewish religion has no time for
it.

00:22:09.548 --> 00:22:11.960
Islam has no time for it
whatsoever.

00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:15.698
But it just shows you that the
scale of the catastrophe of the

00:22:15.698 --> 00:22:19.130
human loss of the First World
War challenged conventional

00:22:19.130 --> 00:22:22.378
institutions and frameworks for
understanding what was

00:22:22.378 --> 00:22:23.358
happening.
 

00:22:23.358 --> 00:22:29.674
If séances are a kind of
collective remembrance,

00:22:29.674 --> 00:22:32.950
they created,
as it were,

00:22:32.950 --> 00:22:36.705
the precedent for the ones that
have left their most powerful

00:22:36.705 --> 00:22:39.134
marks,
not only on Europe but beyond

00:22:39.134 --> 00:22:39.970
it, as well.
 

00:22:39.970 --> 00:22:41.690
These are war memorials.
 

00:22:41.690 --> 00:22:46.721
The need to create a substitute
tomb, a substitute place in

00:22:46.721 --> 00:22:50.452
front of which to mourn,
is what creates the

00:22:50.452 --> 00:22:54.009
extraordinary vogue of war
memorials.

00:22:54.009 --> 00:22:57.068
You don't have to go very far
to see them.

00:22:57.068 --> 00:22:59.366
All you have to do is go
through Commons,

00:22:59.366 --> 00:23:02.355
and you'll see two war
memorials that were created at

00:23:02.355 --> 00:23:04.825
the same moment,
right after the First World

00:23:04.825 --> 00:23:05.400
War.
 

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:10.828
When you see the names of Civil
War vets who were Yale men,

00:23:10.828 --> 00:23:13.700
when you go through Commons on
the walls,

00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:16.460
you should recognize that was
completed in the 1920s,

00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:19.578
at the same time as there is a
façade,

00:23:19.578 --> 00:23:22.902
a war memorial in front of
Commons with the names of the

00:23:22.902 --> 00:23:25.500
battles that American soldiers
fought in.

00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:28.410
In front of that is a cenotaph.
 

00:23:28.410 --> 00:23:30.391
The cenotaph,
an empty tomb,

00:23:30.391 --> 00:23:34.059
says that these men died for
liberty, and so on.

00:23:34.059 --> 00:23:35.680
It is an empty tomb.
 

00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:37.430
This is the critical point to
bear in mind.

00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:40.680
The enormous development of
commemorative forms,

00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:43.922
in particular sculptured,
architectural war memorials in

00:23:43.922 --> 00:23:46.890
the twentieth century,
comes from the First World War.

00:23:46.890 --> 00:23:51.413
Anyone who goes--and I think
it's marvelous that we can talk

00:23:51.413 --> 00:23:54.250
about this in this particular
room.

00:23:54.250 --> 00:23:57.729
Anyone who goes to see Maya
Linn's Vietnam Veterans Memorial

00:23:57.729 --> 00:24:01.503
will see an outcome of a lecture
on First World War commemoration

00:24:01.503 --> 00:24:05.338
that took place in this room,
where Maya Linn was a student.

00:24:05.338 --> 00:24:10.384
She studied First World War
memorials in order to create the

00:24:10.384 --> 00:24:12.779
Vietnam Veterans Memorial.
 

00:24:12.779 --> 00:24:13.578
Why?
 

00:24:13.578 --> 00:24:15.865
If you go to the Vietnam
Veterans Memorial you'll

00:24:15.865 --> 00:24:18.578
understand the genius of First
World War commemoration.

00:24:18.578 --> 00:24:21.849
The only thing that matters are
the names.

00:24:21.849 --> 00:24:24.528
The names are what matters.
 

00:24:24.528 --> 00:24:29.114
The highly-polished granite
surface of the Vietnam Veterans

00:24:29.114 --> 00:24:33.618
Memorial has your own reflection
forced back upon you,

00:24:33.618 --> 00:24:39.259
to touch the names is the way
to find a means,

00:24:39.259 --> 00:24:42.349
inadequate perhaps,
symbolic perhaps,

00:24:42.349 --> 00:24:46.434
to bring the dead back home,
to bring them to the center of

00:24:46.434 --> 00:24:49.719
American history in the middle
of the Mall at the intersection

00:24:49.719 --> 00:24:52.950
between the Lincoln Memorial and
the Washington memorial.

00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:57.788
It is an extraordinary
gathering together of the bones,

00:24:57.788 --> 00:25:03.163
of the remains of the dead who
were buried in Europe or never

00:25:03.163 --> 00:25:04.059
found.
 

00:25:04.059 --> 00:25:06.240
Why does this matter?
 

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:09.490
It matters because the
universalization of mourning,

00:25:09.490 --> 00:25:13.123
of bereavement in the First
World War meant that these war

00:25:13.123 --> 00:25:15.289
memorials are all over Europe.
 

00:25:15.289 --> 00:25:16.470
They're everywhere.
 

00:25:16.470 --> 00:25:19.950
There are 38,000 of them in
England.

00:25:19.950 --> 00:25:21.868
Every village has one.
 

00:25:21.868 --> 00:25:24.400
Every commune,
I think, bar twelve in all of

00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:24.930
France.
 

00:25:24.930 --> 00:25:27.578
There are 30,000 of them in
France alone.

00:25:27.578 --> 00:25:31.618
These war memorials are
extraordinary in many respects.

00:25:31.618 --> 00:25:33.160
I want to tell you about them
today.

00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:37.336
They are places where,
next Tuesday,

00:25:37.336 --> 00:25:43.900
on the 11^(th) of November,
there will be ceremonies.

00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:50.970
It's a public holiday in France.
 

00:25:50.970 --> 00:25:53.557
The mayor of the town will be
at the head of a

00:25:53.557 --> 00:25:56.144
procession--this is
choreographed all over the

00:25:56.144 --> 00:25:59.537
country--in which there will be
100 school children who will

00:25:59.537 --> 00:26:02.720
march in the rain and the sleet,
it doesn't matter,

00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:04.170
to the local war memorial.
 

00:26:04.170 --> 00:26:08.057
What happens then is that the
mayor reads out the names of

00:26:08.057 --> 00:26:11.875
those from a small village or
from a town who died in the

00:26:11.875 --> 00:26:13.240
First World War.
 

00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:17.244
The children in the school
after the name of Cohen Albert

00:26:17.244 --> 00:26:21.179
will say "pr&amp;eacu
te;sent," will answer

00:26:21.179 --> 00:26:23.538
for the men who aren't there.
 

00:26:23.538 --> 00:26:27.048
This bonding between the living
and the dead,

00:26:27.048 --> 00:26:31.029
the bringing back of the dead
to their own villages,

00:26:31.029 --> 00:26:33.663
to their homes,
was a substitute burial

00:26:33.663 --> 00:26:37.240
ceremony for the ones that could
never take place.

00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:40.740
How did it all happen?
 

00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:45.914
The first point that has to be
made is that the commemorative

00:26:45.914 --> 00:26:49.970
wave took place through
political leadership.

00:26:49.970 --> 00:26:52.848
Politics means many things.
 

00:26:52.848 --> 00:26:56.486
The first thing it has to mean
is that there is a fundamental

00:26:56.486 --> 00:27:00.122
difference between the way in
which men are remembered in the

00:27:00.122 --> 00:27:01.940
winners and in the losers.
 

00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:04.538
In the case of Germany,
where there were two million

00:27:04.538 --> 00:27:07.698
soldiers who died in the First
World War, this is an enormously

00:27:07.698 --> 00:27:08.818
difficult problem.
 

00:27:08.818 --> 00:27:14.941
The reason is that you not only
need to remember the dead,

00:27:14.941 --> 00:27:21.063
but you have to find a way and
a form to answer an eternal

00:27:21.063 --> 00:27:22.460
question.
 

00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:26.537
The question is:
how is it possible to glorify

00:27:26.537 --> 00:27:31.338
those who die in war without
glorifying war itself?

00:27:31.338 --> 00:27:36.420
The extraordinary wave of
commemorative activity,

00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:39.602
the cultural practices of
commemoration that were

00:27:39.602 --> 00:27:43.645
universal in Europe in the 1920s
and 1930s have many different

00:27:43.645 --> 00:27:44.838
answers to it.
 

00:27:44.838 --> 00:27:49.098
Most of the time what happens
is that politics became local,

00:27:49.098 --> 00:27:54.213
that small groups of people in
small towns and villages took it

00:27:54.213 --> 00:27:59.000
upon themselves to answer the
question: What will we do?

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:00.950
How will we remember the men of
our village?

00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:05.682
Given the numbers,
we're talking about three,

00:28:05.682 --> 00:28:09.338
four brothers in agrarian
towns.

00:28:09.338 --> 00:28:12.160
We're talking about fathers and
sons who never came back.

00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:16.140
We're talking about the
absolutely personal,

00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:19.750
face-to-face culture of village
life.

00:28:19.750 --> 00:28:21.799
Everyone knew the names.
 

00:28:21.799 --> 00:28:24.058
Everybody knew the families.
 

00:28:24.058 --> 00:28:29.040
What this means is that it may
be the case that high politics

00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:33.357
set out certain lines--the
cabinets, the politicians,

00:28:33.357 --> 00:28:34.769
the generals.
 

00:28:34.769 --> 00:28:38.414
But what's extraordinary about
Europe between the wars is how

00:28:38.414 --> 00:28:42.237
democratic commemoration was,
and how much life there was in

00:28:42.237 --> 00:28:45.930
civil society in order to create
forms that were separate.

00:28:45.930 --> 00:28:47.759
That's why I mentioned the
poppy fund.

00:28:47.759 --> 00:28:49.130
This is a private organization.
 

00:28:49.130 --> 00:28:50.259
It's not a public charity.
 

00:28:50.259 --> 00:28:51.259
It's not the state.
 

00:28:51.259 --> 00:28:54.972
It's civil society speaking its
compassionate language of

00:28:54.972 --> 00:28:58.553
remembering not only the fallen,
but those left behind,

00:28:58.553 --> 00:29:01.140
the widows, the orphans,
and so on.

00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:05.640
I'll give you an example of how
civil society and state power

00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:06.990
differ and vary.
 

00:29:06.990 --> 00:29:13.078
On the 14^(th) of July 1919,
just two weeks after the

00:29:13.078 --> 00:29:17.328
signing of the peace treaty on
the 28^(th) of June 1919,

00:29:17.328 --> 00:29:19.878
when the Germans were forced to
accept the terms of the Treaty

00:29:19.878 --> 00:29:22.950
of Versailles,
there was a victory parade in

00:29:22.950 --> 00:29:23.519
Paris.
 

00:29:23.519 --> 00:29:27.778
That victory parade had a march
past the Champs-Elysées,

00:29:27.778 --> 00:29:29.838
through the Arc de Triomphe.
 

00:29:29.838 --> 00:29:32.272
It's only happened twice in
history and this was one of

00:29:32.272 --> 00:29:33.759
them, to celebrate the victory.
 

00:29:33.759 --> 00:29:35.750
The French were there.
 

00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:36.849
The Americans were there.
 

00:29:36.849 --> 00:29:37.660
The Brits were there.
 

00:29:37.660 --> 00:29:39.799
The Italians were there.
 

00:29:39.799 --> 00:29:41.078
All the Allies were there.
 

00:29:41.078 --> 00:29:43.088
There are two things that
happened.

00:29:43.088 --> 00:29:45.460
One was that Georges
Clemenceau,

00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:47.930
the French prime minister,
decided in this spectacle,

00:29:47.930 --> 00:29:50.730
"We need a symbol of the
lost generation."

00:29:50.730 --> 00:29:53.558
So, he had a
papier-mâché

00:29:53.558 --> 00:29:57.000
catafalque built,
a very big ornate plinth.

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.622
On top of it was a cenotaph,
an empty tomb,

00:29:59.622 --> 00:30:03.305
to symbolize the tombs of all
those soldiers who died in the

00:30:03.305 --> 00:30:05.990
war, half of whom have no known
graves.

00:30:05.990 --> 00:30:12.166
To start the victory parade,
Clemenceau insisted that the

00:30:12.166 --> 00:30:17.695
people who lead the way are the
most badly mutilated men of the

00:30:17.695 --> 00:30:18.488
war,
the

00:30:18.488 --> 00:30:20.569
gueules-cassés,
men with broken faces,

00:30:20.569 --> 00:30:22.940
the men without arms,
the men without legs.

00:30:22.940 --> 00:30:29.285
The use of this vanguard of the
suffering transformed a victory

00:30:29.285 --> 00:30:32.559
parade into a day of mourning.
 

00:30:32.559 --> 00:30:34.079
This was extraordinary.
 

00:30:34.079 --> 00:30:35.838
It was absolutely extraordinary.
 

00:30:35.838 --> 00:30:39.477
The Brits decided if there's
going to be something on the

00:30:39.477 --> 00:30:42.140
14^(th) of July,
we'd better do something,

00:30:42.140 --> 00:30:42.660
too.
 

00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:44.630
It'll take five days for us to
get everybody back over.

00:30:44.630 --> 00:30:47.626
On the 19^(th) of July we need
a victory parade,

00:30:47.626 --> 00:30:48.009
too.
 

00:30:48.009 --> 00:30:51.558
Three-quarters of a million
British men died in the war,

00:30:51.558 --> 00:30:55.108
another 250,000 from the empire
and so on, dominions.

00:30:55.108 --> 00:30:57.836
A million men from the British
forces died in the First World

00:30:57.836 --> 00:30:58.109
War.
 

00:30:58.109 --> 00:30:59.140
We need a victory parade.
 

00:30:59.140 --> 00:31:02.098
So, they asked the architect,
Edwin Lutyens,

00:31:02.098 --> 00:31:05.308
to put together another
papier-mâché

00:31:05.308 --> 00:31:08.410
memorial called The Cenotaph,
an empty tomb.

00:31:08.410 --> 00:31:12.355
They put it right in the middle
of Whitehall,

00:31:12.355 --> 00:31:15.215
official London,
right next to 10 Downing

00:31:15.215 --> 00:31:17.509
Street,
next to Buckingham Palace,

00:31:17.509 --> 00:31:21.890
basically a small stroll down
to the houses of parliament,

00:31:21.890 --> 00:31:23.839
right in the middle of official
London.

00:31:23.839 --> 00:31:25.940
They had their parade.
 

00:31:25.940 --> 00:31:27.759
But that wasn't the end of it.
 

00:31:27.759 --> 00:31:31.823
Two million people came to it,
and they all deposited whatever

00:31:31.823 --> 00:31:34.887
they had to offer to the dead of
the Great War,

00:31:34.887 --> 00:31:37.220
because this was an empty tomb.
 

00:31:37.220 --> 00:31:40.789
It wasn't the empty tomb of
Christ.

00:31:40.789 --> 00:31:43.848
It was a Greek form.
 

00:31:43.848 --> 00:31:47.743
This drove the churchmen
leading the Church of England

00:31:47.743 --> 00:31:48.700
apoplectic.
 

00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:52.398
It meant that the language of
commemoration was ecumenical and

00:31:52.398 --> 00:31:53.369
not Christian.
 

00:31:53.369 --> 00:31:55.019
Why should that be?
 

00:31:55.019 --> 00:31:57.940
Lutyens was the man who
designed New Delhi.

00:31:57.940 --> 00:32:00.568
He was the architect of empire.
 

00:32:00.568 --> 00:32:04.622
He wanted a memorial that would
suffice for Hindu soldiers who

00:32:04.622 --> 00:32:06.532
had died,
Muslim soldiers,

00:32:06.532 --> 00:32:08.968
Jewish soldiers,
Anglican, Catholic,

00:32:08.968 --> 00:32:11.650
Irish, whatever,
people of no belief at all,

00:32:11.650 --> 00:32:12.420
and he found it.
 

00:32:12.420 --> 00:32:15.568
He found the simplest possible
way.

00:32:15.568 --> 00:32:18.375
As a result of this
extraordinary outpouring of

00:32:18.375 --> 00:32:22.036
feeling, literally flowers they
kept on having to shovel away

00:32:22.036 --> 00:32:24.660
because there were so many
things left.

00:32:24.660 --> 00:32:25.769
Understandably.
 

00:32:25.769 --> 00:32:30.715
These are families who finally
found a way to express perhaps a

00:32:30.715 --> 00:32:32.950
form of symbolic exchange.
 

00:32:32.950 --> 00:32:35.140
It happens in the Vietnam Wall,
too.

00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:35.940
People leave things.
 

00:32:35.940 --> 00:32:36.848
Why?
 

00:32:36.848 --> 00:32:40.656
These people whose names are on
the wall, those people who died,

00:32:40.656 --> 00:32:43.799
represented by the cenotaph
have given everything.

00:32:43.799 --> 00:32:45.299
I need to give something.
 

00:32:45.299 --> 00:32:46.349
Pilgrimage is hard.
 

00:32:46.349 --> 00:32:47.289
It's not tourism.
 

00:32:47.289 --> 00:32:48.400
It should be difficult.
 

00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:50.960
You should give, not just get.
 

00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:54.086
The critical thing there is
that clearly the British people

00:32:54.086 --> 00:32:57.000
voted with their feet for the
national war memorial.

00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:58.548
So, the cabinet said,
"Lutyens,

00:32:58.548 --> 00:33:00.759
could you do it again,
this time in stone?"

00:33:00.759 --> 00:33:02.130
He did.
 

00:33:02.130 --> 00:33:04.019
He did it again in stone.
 

00:33:04.019 --> 00:33:07.502
A year later when the Unknown
Soldier was buried in

00:33:07.502 --> 00:33:10.358
Westminster Abbey,
where did people go?

00:33:10.358 --> 00:33:11.920
They went and paid their
respects.

00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:13.098
You can still do it today.
 

00:33:13.098 --> 00:33:15.028
The Abbey is the home of kings
and poets.

00:33:15.028 --> 00:33:19.134
No, the people's monument is
The Cenotaph in Whitehall,

00:33:19.134 --> 00:33:23.390
not the church of the kings,
but it's the sacred space of

00:33:23.390 --> 00:33:24.529
the people.
 

00:33:24.529 --> 00:33:26.588
It remains so to this day.
 

00:33:26.588 --> 00:33:28.867
Now, that man,
Edwin Lutyens,

00:33:28.867 --> 00:33:33.586
designed another set of war
memorials that lead us directly

00:33:33.586 --> 00:33:34.970
to Maya Linn.
 

00:33:34.970 --> 00:33:39.122
Thiepval, T-H-I-E-P-V-A-L is a
small village that no longer

00:33:39.122 --> 00:33:42.130
exists in the Somme,
in northern France.

00:33:42.130 --> 00:33:44.520
There he was asked,
eighteen years later,

00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:48.048
to do a memorial for the 73,000
British soldiers who died in

00:33:48.048 --> 00:33:50.798
that one battle,
and have no known graves.

00:33:50.798 --> 00:33:53.855
What he created was an
extraordinary arc,

00:33:53.855 --> 00:33:57.750
an Arc of Triumph that
basically has small arches on

00:33:57.750 --> 00:34:00.118
top of it and then nothing.
 

00:34:00.118 --> 00:34:03.960
He reduced the Arc of Triumph
to nothingness.

00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:06.967
The only thing you do is when
you walk up to it,

00:34:06.967 --> 00:34:10.550
my eyesight is dreadful,
but younger people do it too.

00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:11.469
It just depends.
 

00:34:11.469 --> 00:34:15.059
When you get close--for me it's
very close,

00:34:15.059 --> 00:34:18.081
for other people it's further
away--you all of a sudden see

00:34:18.081 --> 00:34:20.998
that the walls of this arch that
he built in Thiepval are

00:34:20.998 --> 00:34:22.768
completely covered with names.
 

00:34:22.768 --> 00:34:26.429
There's a vanishing point where
you suddenly see them.

00:34:26.429 --> 00:34:27.719
From a distance you can't see
it.

00:34:27.719 --> 00:34:28.739
It just looks like a
façade.

00:34:28.739 --> 00:34:29.909
There are the names.
 

00:34:29.909 --> 00:34:34.860
It's that which Maya Linn heard
about in this lecture hall,

00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:39.300
when Vincent Scully talked
about Lutyens and commemoration,

00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:43.219
that inspired her to create the
Vietnam Veterans Memorial.

00:34:43.219 --> 00:34:47.010
She's told me what it felt like
to sit in this room and do it.

00:34:47.010 --> 00:34:51.490
She actually submitted her
design for that memorial as the

00:34:51.490 --> 00:34:55.501
design that was ultimately the
winning design in the

00:34:55.501 --> 00:34:56.760
competition.
 

00:34:56.760 --> 00:34:57.920
It was anonymous.
 

00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:01.320
By the way, she got a B for it
in her class.

00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:03.070
I'll leave that aside.
 

00:35:03.070 --> 00:35:05.739
"'Judgment is mine,'
sayeth the Lord."

00:35:05.739 --> 00:35:09.882
All I can do is to tell you
that the forms that were created

00:35:09.882 --> 00:35:13.885
in the cenotaph were ones that
have endured throughout the

00:35:13.885 --> 00:35:17.820
twentieth century to describe
how war is remembered.

00:35:17.820 --> 00:35:21.039
Now, The Cenotaph,
as I say, is pre-Christian.

00:35:21.039 --> 00:35:25.090
It's one more move away from
the institutionalization of

00:35:25.090 --> 00:35:25.900
religion.
 

00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:30.320
It's not that the sacred died
in twentieth-century Europe;

00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:31.639
it moved out of the churches.
 

00:35:31.639 --> 00:35:33.530
It can be found elsewhere.
 

00:35:33.530 --> 00:35:37.713
One of the places where it will
be found next Tuesday is in

00:35:37.713 --> 00:35:41.826
front of war memorials that were
placed all over villages,

00:35:41.826 --> 00:35:44.820
towns, marketplaces,
all over Europe.

00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:46.250
Let me return to that process.
 

00:35:46.250 --> 00:35:47.570
The first I said is political.
 

00:35:47.570 --> 00:35:49.599
Small groups of people,
the busybodies,

00:35:49.599 --> 00:35:51.918
the committeemen that always
exist in small towns with

00:35:51.918 --> 00:35:55.659
nothing better to do,
retired men or men of leisure,

00:35:55.659 --> 00:35:56.619
sometimes women.
 

00:35:56.619 --> 00:35:59.932
What they did was,
"We want to design this

00:35:59.932 --> 00:36:01.230
ourselves."
 

00:36:01.230 --> 00:36:04.257
The first thing you have to
figure out is:

00:36:04.257 --> 00:36:06.030
How much does it cost?
 

00:36:06.030 --> 00:36:09.309
Hence, we should always
recognize that commemoration is

00:36:09.309 --> 00:36:10.099
a business.
 

00:36:10.099 --> 00:36:13.940
The cost factor actually
matters substantially.

00:36:13.940 --> 00:36:17.481
The reason why it matters
substantially is that if you

00:36:17.481 --> 00:36:20.711
want something sculptural,
if you want something like a

00:36:20.711 --> 00:36:24.382
piece of architecture,
the cheapest possible form of

00:36:24.382 --> 00:36:26.239
stone is an obelisk.
 

00:36:26.239 --> 00:36:28.239
You don't have to do much.
 

00:36:28.239 --> 00:36:30.349
You just hack it here or there
and that's it.

00:36:30.349 --> 00:36:32.940
It has a great advantage,
which is that it's Egyptian;

00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:33.969
it's pre-Christian again.
 

00:36:33.969 --> 00:36:36.259
It doesn't require you to
distinguish between Protestant,

00:36:36.259 --> 00:36:37.650
Catholic, Jews,
or anybody else.

00:36:37.650 --> 00:36:41.239
It's an ecumenical form and
it's the most popular one.

00:36:41.239 --> 00:36:44.570
The second problem is that in
France,

00:36:44.570 --> 00:36:47.286
in particular--Germany has its
own headaches--but in France,

00:36:47.286 --> 00:36:49.347
in particular,
church and state had been

00:36:49.347 --> 00:36:52.679
separated in 1905,
and rather violently separated.

00:36:52.679 --> 00:36:56.018
No crosses, except in some
Catholic areas where they said,

00:36:56.018 --> 00:36:57.659
"I don't really care.
 

00:36:57.659 --> 00:36:59.277
We're going to have a cross no
matter what,"

00:36:59.277 --> 00:37:01.099
which is true in Catholic
Brittany, in the northwest of

00:37:01.099 --> 00:37:01.639
the country.
 

00:37:01.639 --> 00:37:03.690
Most of the time there are not
crosses.

00:37:03.690 --> 00:37:07.840
What they show primarily are
two kinds of representations.

00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:12.079
The first is of a Gallic
rooster, which again could be

00:37:12.079 --> 00:37:16.000
bought through a mail order
catalog, or a soldier,

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:17.679
the poilu.
 

00:37:17.679 --> 00:37:21.599
The British liked to see their
soldiers shaved.

00:37:21.599 --> 00:37:23.844
For the French,
the idea of a soldier should be

00:37:23.844 --> 00:37:25.894
somebody who's a hairy one,
a poilu,

00:37:25.894 --> 00:37:27.360
somebody who never shaved.
 

00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:30.431
Having a beard is being
masculine, being a tough guy,

00:37:30.431 --> 00:37:32.440
being a soldier who won the
war.

00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:36.190
A poilu could be bought,
again, on a mail order catalog.

00:37:36.190 --> 00:37:39.581
Overwhelmingly,
and this is a very important

00:37:39.581 --> 00:37:43.840
point, overwhelmingly,
the images are not triumphal.

00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:45.340
They are mournful.
 

00:37:45.340 --> 00:37:48.717
Again, these were decided by
small groups of people who put

00:37:48.717 --> 00:37:51.981
together money in order to
describe the ways in which war

00:37:51.981 --> 00:37:55.389
memorials should be organized,
should be designed,

00:37:55.389 --> 00:37:57.230
and, indeed,
should be paid for.

00:37:57.230 --> 00:38:01.019
They were paid for by popular
subscription overwhelmingly,

00:38:01.019 --> 00:38:03.347
pennies, sous,
francs, deutschmarks,

00:38:03.347 --> 00:38:05.409
whatever, whatever you had.
 

00:38:05.409 --> 00:38:06.929
That's the way it was done.
 

00:38:06.929 --> 00:38:09.550
What about the inscriptions?
 

00:38:09.550 --> 00:38:12.793
Once more I want to reinforce
the point that I made earlier

00:38:12.793 --> 00:38:14.920
about the democratic nature of
loss.

00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:18.710
Ninety-five percent of war
memorials list people either

00:38:18.710 --> 00:38:22.922
alphabetically or by the year or
the time in which they died,

00:38:22.922 --> 00:38:25.170
the sequence of their death.
 

00:38:25.170 --> 00:38:28.523
Only five percent of all war
memorials in Europe that I've

00:38:28.523 --> 00:38:30.487
ever seen,
and I've tried to collect

00:38:30.487 --> 00:38:32.309
material all over the place on
this,

00:38:32.309 --> 00:38:34.518
have men listed by rank.
 

00:38:34.518 --> 00:38:41.023
There is a democracy of death
and of commemoration in highly

00:38:41.023 --> 00:38:43.889
inegalitarian societies.
 

00:38:43.889 --> 00:38:48.686
It is something extraordinary
that goes on when loss is so

00:38:48.686 --> 00:38:53.822
general it becomes apparent that
it isn't possible to separate

00:38:53.822 --> 00:38:57.610
those who died in uniform,
in high rank,

00:38:57.610 --> 00:39:00.460
from those who died as private
soldiers.

00:39:00.460 --> 00:39:05.695
One important point to bear in
mind is that once the choice of

00:39:05.695 --> 00:39:08.932
place was made,
and the choice of form was

00:39:08.932 --> 00:39:11.657
made,
and the money was gathered

00:39:11.657 --> 00:39:16.804
together and paid to the artist
or the sculptor who would do

00:39:16.804 --> 00:39:20.639
this,
then we come to the third part

00:39:20.639 --> 00:39:23.690
of the commemorative process.
 

00:39:23.690 --> 00:39:24.969
The first is political.
 

00:39:24.969 --> 00:39:28.130
By that I mean small politics
more than big politics.

00:39:28.130 --> 00:39:32.121
The second is business,
the money, the commissioning,

00:39:32.121 --> 00:39:35.039
the putting together of the
project.

00:39:35.039 --> 00:39:36.940
The third is the ritual.
 

00:39:36.940 --> 00:39:40.275
What do people do when they
stand in front of a war

00:39:40.275 --> 00:39:41.010
memorial?
 

00:39:41.010 --> 00:39:43.768
The answer is very different
things.

00:39:43.768 --> 00:39:48.597
The first thing that happens in
the front of war memorials,

00:39:48.597 --> 00:39:52.260
and it still happens,
is that women enter the

00:39:52.260 --> 00:39:54.010
narrative of war.
 

00:39:54.010 --> 00:39:58.050
Women are at the center of the
commemorative practice.

00:39:58.050 --> 00:40:02.449
They are not at the center of
the narratives of war from the

00:40:02.449 --> 00:40:05.434
battlefield or,
indeed, from the military

00:40:05.434 --> 00:40:07.150
perspective itself.
 

00:40:07.150 --> 00:40:09.650
There are those who believe
that, indeed,

00:40:09.650 --> 00:40:13.985
the gendering of the narratives
of war separates the stories

00:40:13.985 --> 00:40:18.028
told by soldiers in novels and
memoirs from those of the

00:40:18.028 --> 00:40:22.440
societies for which they fought
and for which they died.

00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:24.030
I'm not sure if that is true or
not.

00:40:24.030 --> 00:40:26.280
But what we can say,
and there are thousands of

00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:29.619
photographs that show it,
is that the ritual that happens

00:40:29.619 --> 00:40:32.789
in front of memorials are
rituals of families.

00:40:32.789 --> 00:40:36.405
In conventional terms,
by that I mean historically

00:40:36.405 --> 00:40:40.166
overdetermined ways,
women have been associated with

00:40:40.166 --> 00:40:43.340
mourning practices since the
Egyptians.

00:40:43.340 --> 00:40:47.510
There are tombs in the Valley
of the Queens in Luxor that show

00:40:47.510 --> 00:40:50.554
professional mourners,
women who have tears painted on

00:40:50.554 --> 00:40:54.420
their cheeks,
from the time of the pharaohs.

00:40:54.420 --> 00:40:58.751
Whether that is true or not,
the notion of Mater Dolorosa,

00:40:58.751 --> 00:41:01.235
Stabat Mater,
"His mother was

00:41:01.235 --> 00:41:04.648
there," is a Catholic trope
of great power and importance in

00:41:04.648 --> 00:41:07.900
understanding how societies
configure loss of life in war.

00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:10.528
So, the first point is that
women and children,

00:41:10.528 --> 00:41:11.730
families are there.
 

00:41:11.730 --> 00:41:14.820
The second is there is a
didactic function.

00:41:14.820 --> 00:41:16.489
School children come there.
 

00:41:16.489 --> 00:41:18.161
This, I think,
is a very important point to

00:41:18.161 --> 00:41:18.760
bear in mind.
 

00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:21.425
Overwhelmingly,
and this is true in Germany

00:41:21.425 --> 00:41:24.516
until the 1930s,
Italy it's true until the late

00:41:24.516 --> 00:41:26.385
1920s,
and it's true all over Britain

00:41:26.385 --> 00:41:29.699
and France,
and certainly in the dominions.

00:41:29.699 --> 00:41:36.570
The rituals have a by-word that
dominates the message.

00:41:36.570 --> 00:41:40.577
It is "never again,"
the phrase we frequently

00:41:40.577 --> 00:41:45.179
associate with the Holocaust,
with the war against genocide.

00:41:45.179 --> 00:41:48.777
Yes, that's true,
but the phrase "never

00:41:48.777 --> 00:41:52.710
again" comes out of the
First World War.

00:41:52.710 --> 00:41:56.706
It's what dominates the
commemorative practices of the

00:41:56.706 --> 00:41:58.139
inter-war period.
 

00:41:58.139 --> 00:42:00.590
This is the war to end all wars.
 

00:42:00.590 --> 00:42:03.429
This is the war that makes war
impossible.

00:42:03.429 --> 00:42:07.190
This is a war so dreadful that
it is not at all the purpose of

00:42:07.190 --> 00:42:10.519
those who go to commemorative
forms to prepare the next

00:42:10.519 --> 00:42:12.369
generation for their turn.
 

00:42:12.369 --> 00:42:13.539
On the contrary.
 

00:42:13.539 --> 00:42:16.719
The notion of commemoration in
inter-war Europe is "never

00:42:16.719 --> 00:42:17.449
again."
 

00:42:17.449 --> 00:42:20.617
That explains why the
commemorative power of the

00:42:20.617 --> 00:42:24.527
period around the First World
War is not repeated after the

00:42:24.527 --> 00:42:25.268
Second.
 

00:42:25.268 --> 00:42:28.110
In France you can see this
anywhere.

00:42:28.110 --> 00:42:29.289
In Britain it's there, too.
 

00:42:29.289 --> 00:42:30.925
In Germany there are more
difficult reasons,

00:42:30.925 --> 00:42:31.989
obviously, to handle this.
 

00:42:31.989 --> 00:42:33.784
In Eastern Europe,
where the massacres were so

00:42:33.784 --> 00:42:35.179
gigantic, it's almost
impossible.

00:42:35.179 --> 00:42:38.396
What happens in Western Europe
is that the names of those who

00:42:38.396 --> 00:42:41.559
die in the Second World War are
tacked on to First World War

00:42:41.559 --> 00:42:42.309
memorials.
 

00:42:42.309 --> 00:42:44.550
Part of the reason is financial.
 

00:42:44.550 --> 00:42:46.664
If the First World War
impoverished Europe,

00:42:46.664 --> 00:42:48.530
the Second World War bankrupted
it.

00:42:48.530 --> 00:42:50.320
Without the Marshall Plan,
who knows?

00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:53.610
The important point is that
there's another reason.

00:42:53.610 --> 00:42:56.320
How many times can you say,
"never again"?

00:42:56.320 --> 00:42:59.329
If the idea was that these men
died to make war impossible,

00:42:59.329 --> 00:43:01.833
in other words,
their sacrifices were such as

00:43:01.833 --> 00:43:05.239
to eliminate the need for their
children to go to war again,

00:43:05.239 --> 00:43:06.659
then what do you do in 1939?
 

00:43:06.659 --> 00:43:10.923
This is true in Germany, too,
where the 1^(st) of September,

00:43:10.923 --> 00:43:12.751
1939,
the outbreak of the Second

00:43:12.751 --> 00:43:15.001
World War was not greeted by
marching bands,

00:43:15.001 --> 00:43:16.690
and parades,
and so on.

00:43:16.690 --> 00:43:20.427
It was a day of sadness in
Germany as it was elsewhere,

00:43:20.427 --> 00:43:23.889
because everybody knew,
and they knew the costs;

00:43:23.889 --> 00:43:26.750
the Great War had told them
what war is.

00:43:26.750 --> 00:43:30.940
The conclusion I want to draw
on is this.

00:43:30.940 --> 00:43:35.869
Remembering the First World War
has taken many different forms.

00:43:35.869 --> 00:43:38.960
I've dealt with the filmic
mystification of it.

00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:41.878
There's a big business in
novels, in memoirs,

00:43:41.878 --> 00:43:45.461
in an area of what we might
call factoids that are half

00:43:45.461 --> 00:43:47.320
fictional and half true.
 

00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:50.105
Robert Graves' Goodbye to
All That is still in print

00:43:50.105 --> 00:43:51.690
eighty years after he wrote it.
 

00:43:51.690 --> 00:43:54.768
There are many such novels,
All Quiet on the Western

00:43:54.768 --> 00:43:57.219
Front, that are enormous
bestsellers.

00:43:57.219 --> 00:44:00.099
We should accept the fact that
the media matters.

00:44:00.099 --> 00:44:04.481
I think the critical point to
bear in mind is that the

00:44:04.481 --> 00:44:09.193
casualties of the First World
War were so devastating that

00:44:09.193 --> 00:44:13.822
even the losses of the Second
World War didn't change the

00:44:13.822 --> 00:44:18.864
landscape of remembrance that
was constructed between 1918 and

00:44:18.864 --> 00:44:19.940
1939.
 

00:44:19.940 --> 00:44:24.610
War means something in Europe
that it doesn't mean in this

00:44:24.610 --> 00:44:25.429
country.
 

00:44:25.429 --> 00:44:28.773
The reasons can be found in all
of these commemorative

00:44:28.773 --> 00:44:29.530
practices.
 

00:44:29.530 --> 00:44:32.681
It is clear to me that
political culture follows

00:44:32.681 --> 00:44:36.166
history, follows the
understandings people develop of

00:44:36.166 --> 00:44:38.380
the world in which they live.
 

00:44:38.380 --> 00:44:41.659
Europeans see war differently
from Americans.

00:44:41.659 --> 00:44:44.050
It doesn't stop there from
being militaristic groups,

00:44:44.050 --> 00:44:46.679
and those like the Nazis who
wanted to "get it right

00:44:46.679 --> 00:44:49.215
this time around,"
and reverse the verdict of 1918

00:44:49.215 --> 00:44:50.860
under the Treaty of Versailles.
 

00:44:50.860 --> 00:44:54.369
But there's no doubt in my mind
that the First World War message

00:44:54.369 --> 00:44:57.099
of "never again"
survived the Nazis,

00:44:57.099 --> 00:45:00.327
survived Stalin,
to create a different kind of

00:45:00.327 --> 00:45:02.980
Europe in which armies don't
matter anymore.

00:45:02.980 --> 00:45:05.000
They're there.
 

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:07.760
But in the question of a great
historian,

00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:10.501
James Sheehan from Stanford,
who just wrote a history of

00:45:10.501 --> 00:45:13.039
twentieth century,
and the question that he put in

00:45:13.039 --> 00:45:14.849
his title, we have,
I think,

00:45:14.849 --> 00:45:18.032
the final legacy of the
commemoration of the First World

00:45:18.032 --> 00:45:18.380
War.
 

00:45:18.380 --> 00:45:21.599
His book is entitled Where
Have All the Soldiers Gone?

00:45:21.599 --> 00:45:24.898
In late-twentieth-century
Europe, states are defined in

00:45:24.898 --> 00:45:28.501
terms of the way in which they
defend the wellbeing of their

00:45:28.501 --> 00:45:29.480
populations.
 

00:45:29.480 --> 00:45:32.905
No longer are states defined in
terms of the military force that

00:45:32.905 --> 00:45:35.949
they can deploy in defense of
their national interests or

00:45:35.949 --> 00:45:37.309
their imperial power.
 

00:45:37.309 --> 00:45:40.590
The First World War put,
as it were,

00:45:40.590 --> 00:45:44.119
the beginnings--hammered in the
nails in the coffin of the old

00:45:44.119 --> 00:45:47.242
vision that the state is that
institution which has the

00:45:47.242 --> 00:45:50.309
monopoly on the legitimate use
of physical force.

00:45:50.309 --> 00:45:55.800
The story of warfare killed the
old idea of state sovereignty.

00:45:55.800 --> 00:45:59.364
It wasn't dead before the Nazis
made it necessary for us to

00:45:59.364 --> 00:46:01.210
develop something different.
 

00:46:01.210 --> 00:46:04.681
But it is the remembrance of
the First World War which left

00:46:04.681 --> 00:46:07.914
traces in families,
which are the most powerful

00:46:07.914 --> 00:46:11.956
reasons why the First World War
has become and remains the

00:46:11.956 --> 00:46:16.282
iconic disaster that has created
a Europe that no one had ever

00:46:16.282 --> 00:46:19.059
seen before,
and that was vastly different,

00:46:19.059 --> 00:46:20.469
in the minds of ordinary
people,

00:46:20.469 --> 00:46:23.320
than the Europe that existed in
1914.

00:46:23.320 --> 00:46:24.809
Thank you very much.
 

00:46:24.809 --> 00:46:25.809
&gt;

00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:04.546
Prof: Now,
today I am giving a lecture,

00:00:04.546 --> 00:00:07.250
on which you're not going to be
tested.

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:07.760
Okay?
 

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.890
So I'm being an idealistic,
academic intellectual today,

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:14.586
and I'm talking about stuff
which is of general interest and

00:00:14.586 --> 00:00:17.030
is not going to be on the final
exam.

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:21.347
So I want you to kick back and
enjoy this final lecture before

00:00:21.347 --> 00:00:24.319
Spring Break,
and perhaps it will stimulate

00:00:24.319 --> 00:00:27.080
some things for you to think
about.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.380
If you want to read further
about this,

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.537
you can go to the Resources
page and look up Major

00:00:33.537 --> 00:00:37.581
Transitions,
right here, and you'll pick up

00:00:37.581 --> 00:00:42.571
a commentary written in
Evolution to which this talk is

00:00:42.571 --> 00:00:45.039
relevant;
it's structured a little bit

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:45.670
differently.
 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.984
Now I want to give you a little
bit of background on my current

00:00:49.984 --> 00:00:53.741
thinking about this area,
because I'm likely to run out

00:00:53.741 --> 00:00:56.619
of time towards the end;
so I better tell it to you at

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:58.030
the beginning,
otherwise you won't hear it.

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:59.710
&gt;
 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.603
I began worrying about this
issue of whether we're stuck in

00:01:02.603 --> 00:01:04.400
the middle of a major
transition,

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.015
between individual and group,
about now fifteen to eighteen

00:01:09.015 --> 00:01:09.968
years ago.
 

00:01:09.968 --> 00:01:14.230
And in 2005/2006,
after I finished being chair of

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:17.135
the department,
Yale very kindly gave me a

00:01:17.135 --> 00:01:20.031
full-year sabbatical,
and I spent the year reading

00:01:20.031 --> 00:01:23.830
widely in how evolutionary
thought had impacted psychology,

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:25.682
anthropology,
political science,

00:01:25.682 --> 00:01:27.799
economics;
all of these cognate fields

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:30.290
that have something to do with
human behavior,

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.739
and that bear on the issue of
whether or not we have been

00:01:33.739 --> 00:01:37.190
selected to behave in certain
ways in social contexts.

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.757
And I'm going to give you today
a talk that describes my

00:01:41.757 --> 00:01:46.161
motivation to do that,
and the preliminary conclusions

00:01:46.161 --> 00:01:47.739
that I came to.
 

00:01:47.739 --> 00:01:50.869
And you can read about that in
more detail in that commentary

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:52.330
in Evolution,
if you wish.

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.690
You just download the PDF from
the website.

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.496
When I finished all that
process, and I thought about

00:02:00.496 --> 00:02:04.713
sitting down to write a book,
which I did last summer,

00:02:04.713 --> 00:02:09.633
what I discovered is that there
were certain key elements in the

00:02:09.633 --> 00:02:13.227
logic of the argument that
simply were not well

00:02:13.227 --> 00:02:16.818
scientifically established at
this point.

00:02:16.818 --> 00:02:24.008
And I therefore had to make a
decision: Do I remain agnostic,

00:02:24.008 --> 00:02:30.960
or do I go for a colorful and
publication worthy thrill?

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.810
I decided to remain agnostic.
 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.452
I could have published a book
that made claims that probably

00:02:38.452 --> 00:02:43.410
would've gotten into the New
York Times fairly easily.

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.080
And I decided not to.
 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.504
And basically the reason for
that is that I'm a natural

00:02:47.504 --> 00:02:50.298
scientist,
and I don't want to make

00:02:50.298 --> 00:02:54.068
claims, to the broadly educated
public,

00:02:54.068 --> 00:02:56.258
about the nature of the human
condition,

00:02:56.258 --> 00:03:02.461
without having all the links in
the chain of logic pinned down

00:03:02.461 --> 00:03:04.188
by experiments.
 

00:03:04.188 --> 00:03:07.300
I think it's perfectly valid to
do what I'm doing today.

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.740
I'm going to advance some
hypotheses.

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:12.387
I'm going to tell you where
they are or where they are not

00:03:12.387 --> 00:03:15.075
well established;
and I think that by doing that

00:03:15.075 --> 00:03:18.627
I can show you that there are
some really fascinating issues

00:03:18.627 --> 00:03:19.110
here.
 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:23.843
But I don't think it would be
responsible for me to go out and

00:03:23.843 --> 00:03:27.336
publish a book,
in the general trade industry,

00:03:27.336 --> 00:03:29.818
that made the central claim.
 

00:03:29.818 --> 00:03:31.764
This is the central claim:
That we're stuck in a major

00:03:31.764 --> 00:03:32.720
evolutionary transition.
 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.400
We're feeling the pain.
 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.595
The pain is caused by the fact
that there is a conflict between

00:03:37.595 --> 00:03:39.758
individual interest and group
interest,

00:03:39.758 --> 00:03:45.300
and that conflict has not been
resolved,

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.699
and the selection mechanisms
that have been pushing us in

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:51.370
that direction are starting to
break down.

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:55.340
So it's an interesting idea.
 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.575
And, in fact,
the feedback I've had from that

00:03:57.575 --> 00:04:00.219
commentary is that people were
absolutely amazed that

00:04:00.219 --> 00:04:02.610
Evolution allowed me to
publish it,

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:04.598
and it was deeply interesting
and troubling,

00:04:04.598 --> 00:04:07.150
but that clearly it's still an
open issue.

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.561
So I think that the colleagues
I have in the evolutionary

00:04:10.561 --> 00:04:14.400
biology community agree that
it's interesting and unresolved.

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.240
So all of that upfront.
 

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:17.778
Okay, let's go.
 

00:04:17.778 --> 00:04:21.005
This has to do with the impact
of evolutionary thought on the

00:04:21.005 --> 00:04:23.156
social sciences,
and its implications for

00:04:23.156 --> 00:04:24.769
understanding what we are.
 

00:04:28.089 --> 00:04:31.494
I begin with some of the
remarkable observations that led

00:04:31.494 --> 00:04:32.709
me to these ideas.
 

00:04:32.709 --> 00:04:34.910
I was an early Vietnam War
protestor.

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:38.103
I was deeply concerned with the
issue of why I should die for my

00:04:38.103 --> 00:04:42.279
country;
back in 1966/1967.

00:04:42.279 --> 00:04:45.985
Well here are some,
to me, really incredible

00:04:45.985 --> 00:04:49.089
observations about human
behavior.

00:04:49.089 --> 00:04:51.528
The first day of the Battle of
the Somme, July 1^(st),

00:04:51.528 --> 00:04:51.850
1916.
 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:52.949
One day.
 

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:55.916
The British Expeditionary Force
lost 58,000 men,

00:04:55.916 --> 00:04:56.800
in 24 hours.
 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.956
That's as many as were killed-
American were killed in the

00:05:00.956 --> 00:05:04.240
entire Vietnam War,
over about eight years.

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.870
The British continued to attack
until winter.

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:09.110
They lost another 420,000 men.
 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:11.269
During that time the French
lost 200,000;

00:05:11.269 --> 00:05:12.959
the Germans lost half a million.
 

00:05:12.959 --> 00:05:16.339
So, over six months more than a
million people,

00:05:16.339 --> 00:05:19.500
led by idiots,
died in useless slaughter.

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:23.105
And here's the point:
throughout the next two years,

00:05:23.105 --> 00:05:26.783
young males continued to
volunteer for service and to

00:05:26.783 --> 00:05:28.410
obey their leaders.
 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:30.800
That's one hell of an
observation.

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.759
It tells you something very
deep about humans.

00:05:34.759 --> 00:05:39.235
Now, we are susceptible to lots
of other social emotions besides

00:05:39.235 --> 00:05:40.160
patriotism.
 

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.512
We express love,
empathy, compassion,

00:05:42.512 --> 00:05:44.278
guilt, shame,
embarrassment,

00:05:44.278 --> 00:05:48.632
duty and honor;
and we do it by the age of

00:05:48.632 --> 00:05:49.470
three.
 

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:54.269
Paul Bloom, in the Psych
Department,

00:05:54.269 --> 00:05:56.930
has watched the development of
the moral emotions in humans,

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:59.504
in his own children,
and says that by age three they

00:05:59.504 --> 00:06:02.230
had already committed all of the
Seven Deadly Sins,

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:03.439
except lust.
 

00:06:03.439 --> 00:06:05.430
Okay?
 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:09.507
So it looks like the
susceptibility to moral emotions

00:06:09.507 --> 00:06:10.449
is innate.
 

00:06:10.449 --> 00:06:14.555
People who lack moral emotions
we call psychopaths,

00:06:14.555 --> 00:06:15.870
or sociopaths.
 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:18.519
They commit crimes and end up
in prison.

00:06:18.519 --> 00:06:23.812
We will trust strangers enough
to engage in economic

00:06:23.812 --> 00:06:27.675
transactions;
we'll even do it on the web,

00:06:27.675 --> 00:06:29.569
with our credit cards.
 

00:06:29.569 --> 00:06:32.889
That's pretty amazing too.
 

00:06:32.889 --> 00:06:36.149
There's a great story in Paul
Seabright's book about this,

00:06:36.149 --> 00:06:40.206
where about 1500 years ago
traders show up on the banks of

00:06:40.206 --> 00:06:43.420
the Volga River,
to trade with the Khazars;

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:46.156
and the Khazars are a
bloodthirsty people,

00:06:46.156 --> 00:06:47.759
but they've got money.
 

00:06:47.759 --> 00:06:48.720
Right?
 

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:50.740
So the goods are put down on
the bank of the river.

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:51.779
The traders go away.
 

00:06:51.779 --> 00:06:53.709
The Khazars come back,
look at the goods.

00:06:53.709 --> 00:06:57.920
They place a pile of money over
there.

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:00.129
The people never see each other.
 

00:07:00.129 --> 00:07:01.889
They go back and forth for two
or three days,

00:07:01.889 --> 00:07:04.745
kind of bargaining,
by just putting stuff down on

00:07:04.745 --> 00:07:07.401
the ground,
until finally a stake is

00:07:07.401 --> 00:07:09.559
pounded in,
and it's a deal,

00:07:09.559 --> 00:07:13.651
and one side takes the money
and the other side takes the

00:07:13.651 --> 00:07:14.310
goods.
 

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:18.992
It is not clear under what
circumstances people can trust

00:07:18.992 --> 00:07:23.759
each other enough to engage in
an economic transaction;

00:07:23.759 --> 00:07:29.019
especially not since Bernie
Madoff.

00:07:29.019 --> 00:07:32.173
We are willing to pay taxes to
the government,

00:07:32.173 --> 00:07:36.170
in return for services that
benefit the entire country;

00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:38.940
not just ourselves,
not just our relatives.

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:42.446
And if you look at the major
religions of the world,

00:07:42.446 --> 00:07:46.639
you'll find that their central
moral messages are mostly about

00:07:46.639 --> 00:07:48.839
stabilizing social behavior.
 

00:07:48.839 --> 00:07:49.569
Okay?
 

00:07:49.569 --> 00:07:51.879
So in Christianity we've got
the Sermon on the Mount.

00:07:51.879 --> 00:07:53.860
So you should be gentle.
 

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:56.531
You should be merciful;
that means you should be

00:07:56.531 --> 00:07:56.990
forgiving.
 

00:07:56.990 --> 00:08:00.134
You should make peace;
so you should stabilize social

00:08:00.134 --> 00:08:00.639
conflict.
 

00:08:00.639 --> 00:08:02.600
If you got angry with your
brother,

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:04.129
you're going to be guilty
before the court,

00:08:04.129 --> 00:08:08.139
and the central Sermon on the
Mount statement is do unto

00:08:08.139 --> 00:08:11.459
others as you would have them do
unto you.

00:08:11.459 --> 00:08:14.980
If we look at Islam--this is in
the Koran--

00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:18.485
so do good to your parents
and kinsfolk and orphans and

00:08:18.485 --> 00:08:20.120
needy,
and to the neighbor of your kin

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:21.339
and the neighbor not of your
kin,

00:08:21.339 --> 00:08:23.379
and to the fellow neighbor,
and to the wayfarer.

00:08:23.379 --> 00:08:26.588
Look at how that sentence
neatly expands the moral circle

00:08:26.588 --> 00:08:30.516
that Peter Singer talks about,
of how far, how distantly

00:08:30.516 --> 00:08:33.940
related does something have to
be to us,

00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:37.500
for us to feel like we should
behave morally towards them?

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:41.658
And the Koran lays that out
very explicitly.

00:08:41.658 --> 00:08:43.610
Forgive people who offend
you.

00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:44.908
Give to those who refuse you.
 

00:08:44.908 --> 00:08:47.668
Stretch a hand of peace to the
one who quarrels with you;

00:08:47.668 --> 00:08:49.470
very much like turn the other
cheek.

00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:50.120
Okay?
 

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:53.230
Another great tradition,
Confucianism.

00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:56.096
Love others;
be benevolent,

00:08:56.096 --> 00:08:57.080
charitable and kind.
 

00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:57.590
 Okay?
 

00:08:57.590 --> 00:09:00.028
We're now in sixth century BC
China.

00:09:00.028 --> 00:09:03.179
Do your duty to honor your
family and neighbors;

00:09:03.179 --> 00:09:05.830
social relationships.
 

00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:09.057
And what you don't want for
yourself, don't do to

00:09:09.057 --> 00:09:09.879
others.
 

00:09:09.879 --> 00:09:14.375
So a neat little inversion of
the Golden Rule in the Sermon on

00:09:14.375 --> 00:09:17.620
the Mount, in Confucius 500
years earlier.

00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:23.130
Well the idea behind this is
that things like nationalism and

00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:28.000
religion are culturally
transmitted value systems,

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.782
and biology is providing
handles on which those value

00:09:32.782 --> 00:09:34.529
systems can pull.
 

00:09:34.529 --> 00:09:40.375
And the way it does it is very
probably by genetic influence on

00:09:40.375 --> 00:09:43.298
hormones and their receptors.
 

00:09:43.298 --> 00:09:45.346
There are probably other
mechanisms as well,

00:09:45.346 --> 00:09:48.057
but that's at least one of
them, and some of this stuff is

00:09:48.057 --> 00:09:50.009
now under experimental
investigation.

00:09:50.009 --> 00:09:52.490
So, for example, oxytocin.
 

00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:56.523
If I want to stabilize trust,
I can give people lots of

00:09:56.523 --> 00:09:58.926
oxytocin,
and they'll cooperate and trust

00:09:58.926 --> 00:10:01.937
each other a lot more than they
will if I give them an overdose

00:10:01.937 --> 00:10:03.590
of something like testosterone.
 

00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:05.110
Okay?
 

00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:08.833
So testosterone is more or less
more aggression,

00:10:08.833 --> 00:10:12.399
and oxytocin is more trust and
cooperation.

00:10:12.399 --> 00:10:14.682
In other words,
we contain within ourselves

00:10:14.682 --> 00:10:17.399
physiological mechanisms that if
genes want to,

00:10:17.399 --> 00:10:19.620
they can dial up and down like
rheostats,

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:22.735
and that will have some kind of
indirect influence on the

00:10:22.735 --> 00:10:25.350
general level of either
aggression or trust,

00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:27.038
in a group.
 

00:10:27.038 --> 00:10:30.350
So my questions about these
kinds of problems are,

00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:34.404
are we in fact stuck in a major
transition between individual

00:10:34.404 --> 00:10:35.350
and group?
 

00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:39.966
Has it gotten stuck because the
selection mechanisms have broken

00:10:39.966 --> 00:10:40.480
down?
 

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:43.322
Has the breakdown left us in a
state of tension,

00:10:43.322 --> 00:10:46.408
caused by conflicts between
individual and group?

00:10:46.408 --> 00:10:50.068
And do these individual group
conflicts define a significant

00:10:50.068 --> 00:10:51.928
part of the human condition?
 

00:10:51.928 --> 00:10:54.158
You know, once you've seen that
list,

00:10:54.158 --> 00:10:57.090
it's easy to start telling
just-so stories,

00:10:57.090 --> 00:11:00.802
and throwing up lists of
things: unions in conflict with

00:11:00.802 --> 00:11:03.019
management;
Democrats in conflict with

00:11:03.019 --> 00:11:06.009
Republicans over the role of the
individual and the role of

00:11:06.009 --> 00:11:08.330
society in constructing
government policy;

00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:14.291
Communism versus Capitalism;
the way I feel about whether or

00:11:14.291 --> 00:11:19.350
not I should donate to a charity
or keep the money for my wine

00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:20.179
cellar.
 

00:11:20.179 --> 00:11:20.960
You know?
 

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:24.741
There's lots of different
contexts in which that can

00:11:24.741 --> 00:11:25.408
happen.
 

00:11:25.408 --> 00:11:27.440
You can ask yourself,
well what would happen if we

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:29.470
really went right through the
major transition?

00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:32.970
Well, some things have.
 

00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:36.889
Eusocial insect colonies have
gone through this transition;

00:11:36.889 --> 00:11:40.830
and they are defined by
reproductive suppression.

00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:45.071
So if you were living in a
state in which the opportunity

00:11:45.071 --> 00:11:49.236
to reproduce was in fact
determined by the group and not

00:11:49.236 --> 00:11:52.522
by the individual,
that would probably be a pretty

00:11:52.522 --> 00:11:55.158
strong signal that you had
completed the transition.

00:11:55.158 --> 00:11:57.110
We're nowhere near that at the
moment.

00:11:57.110 --> 00:12:02.155
However, we are certainly in a
circumstance in which some of

00:12:02.155 --> 00:12:03.440
that happens.
 

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:05.960
The Chinese One-Child Policy is
an indication of that.

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:09.173
The sort of political
correctness of the environmental

00:12:09.173 --> 00:12:12.874
movement that encourages people
towards zero-population growth

00:12:12.874 --> 00:12:16.210
and only having two children is
that kind of thing.

00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:20.912
So we haven't made the
transition, but certainly there

00:12:20.912 --> 00:12:24.548
are signals that we're partway
into it.

00:12:24.548 --> 00:12:27.200
So here are the hallmarks of
major transitions.

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:28.480
And I want to remind you of
this;

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:31.534
this is from the lecture on
genetic conflict,

00:12:31.534 --> 00:12:35.840
and it's also from the lecture
on major events in evolution.

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:38.702
In a major transition,
things that were previously

00:12:38.702 --> 00:12:41.625
independent fuse into a larger
whole and lose their

00:12:41.625 --> 00:12:42.620
independence.
 

00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:46.611
Then units in that larger whole
specialize on different

00:12:46.611 --> 00:12:49.485
functions;
they achieve a division of

00:12:49.485 --> 00:12:50.019
labor.
 

00:12:50.019 --> 00:12:52.645
That division of labor has to
be stabilized,

00:12:52.645 --> 00:12:56.311
and it then integrates the new
unit and improves performance,

00:12:56.311 --> 00:12:58.450
in competition with like units.
 

00:12:58.450 --> 00:13:03.230
And the cohesive integration,
that's needed within the group,

00:13:03.230 --> 00:13:05.769
requires suppression of
intra-group conflict,

00:13:05.769 --> 00:13:08.509
among previously independent
units,

00:13:08.509 --> 00:13:11.476
so that you can be effective at
competing with other similar

00:13:11.476 --> 00:13:11.928
groups.
 

00:13:11.928 --> 00:13:15.109
Often during this process a new
system of information

00:13:15.109 --> 00:13:16.759
transmission will emerge.
 

00:13:16.759 --> 00:13:20.263
So this is something that's
happened four or five times in

00:13:20.263 --> 00:13:22.658
evolution: prokaryotes to
eukaryotes;

00:13:22.658 --> 00:13:26.009
single-celled eukaryotes to
multi-cellular organisms;

00:13:26.009 --> 00:13:29.970
multi-cellular organisms into
family groups;

00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:33.490
family groups into insect
societies;

00:13:33.490 --> 00:13:38.562
and in mammals into naked
African mole rats and dwarf

00:13:38.562 --> 00:13:41.490
mongooses, things like that.
 

00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:46.542
And in humans the new system of
information transmission is

00:13:46.542 --> 00:13:49.940
cultural transmission,
with language.

00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:53.378
So we now have a parallel
genetic and language

00:13:53.378 --> 00:13:57.581
transmission of information,
and they can be in conflict

00:13:57.581 --> 00:13:59.110
with each other.
 

00:13:59.110 --> 00:14:03.268
So to see if these ideas make
any sense, we need to evaluate

00:14:03.268 --> 00:14:05.028
hierarchical selection.
 

00:14:05.028 --> 00:14:07.460
That sets up conflict between
individual and group.

00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:11.431
We need to see what kind of
cultural group selection might

00:14:11.431 --> 00:14:14.985
be going on, to select for
cohesion, promoting group

00:14:14.985 --> 00:14:16.100
performance.
 

00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:19.547
We need to see how conflicts
are generated and resolved,

00:14:19.547 --> 00:14:23.003
in a selective hierarchy;
so the origins of group

00:14:23.003 --> 00:14:23.769
cohesion.
 

00:14:23.769 --> 00:14:26.601
That brings us to the
contentious subject of whether

00:14:26.601 --> 00:14:29.432
there are tribal social
instincts and how they might

00:14:29.432 --> 00:14:30.210
originate.
 

00:14:30.210 --> 00:14:34.260
I would claim that if I were to
take you guys and put you on a

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:37.328
desert island,
and call half of you greens and

00:14:37.328 --> 00:14:40.471
half of you blues,
and divide the territory of the

00:14:40.471 --> 00:14:42.706
island in two,
that you would develop green

00:14:42.706 --> 00:14:45.298
identity and blue identity,
within about six hours,

00:14:45.298 --> 00:14:47.428
and start organizing for
competition.

00:14:47.428 --> 00:14:49.918
I think humans self-organize to
do that real quick.

00:14:49.918 --> 00:14:51.720
There have been experiments
done on that.

00:14:54.899 --> 00:14:58.115
Then, as part of the claim of
the overall hypothesis that

00:14:58.115 --> 00:15:01.562
we're stuck in the transition
and we're probably not going to

00:15:01.562 --> 00:15:03.793
complete it,
is group selection,

00:15:03.793 --> 00:15:06.586
biological and cultural,
breaking down,

00:15:06.586 --> 00:15:08.820
in our current civilization?
 

00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:12.450
So let's run through that.
 

00:15:12.450 --> 00:15:16.750
Here are the basic issues in
hierarchical selection.

00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:21.182
The thing you need to focus on
is the distribution of variation

00:15:21.182 --> 00:15:22.970
within and among units.
 

00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:28.678
So if most of the variation in
the population is within each

00:15:28.678 --> 00:15:31.144
group,
and the groups don't differ too

00:15:31.144 --> 00:15:33.701
much from each other--
they're all kind of motley,

00:15:33.701 --> 00:15:35.480
but they're all similarly
motley--

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:39.032
then you won't really have very
much opportunity for group

00:15:39.032 --> 00:15:39.779
selection.
 

00:15:39.779 --> 00:15:43.890
But if the variation in the
population is homogenous within

00:15:43.890 --> 00:15:46.206
groups,
and different between groups,

00:15:46.206 --> 00:15:49.308
you have a much bigger
opportunity for group selection.

00:15:49.308 --> 00:15:53.128
The strength of selection,
in part, is going to be

00:15:53.128 --> 00:15:57.570
determined by the rate at which
units are born and die.

00:15:57.570 --> 00:15:59.399
So if the little units,
inside the groups,

00:15:59.399 --> 00:16:01.798
do things very rapidly,
and the big units,

00:16:01.798 --> 00:16:04.792
the groups, do things very
slowly, then that's going to

00:16:04.792 --> 00:16:07.894
prejudice things towards the
individual and away from the

00:16:07.894 --> 00:16:10.009
group;
and vice-versa.

00:16:10.009 --> 00:16:11.778
Okay?
 

00:16:11.778 --> 00:16:14.158
Then you need to look at the
correlation of reproductive

00:16:14.158 --> 00:16:16.149
success, with trait variation at
each level.

00:16:16.149 --> 00:16:18.710
That just takes us back to the
first lecture in the course.

00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:19.740
Right?
 

00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:23.730
Conditions, four conditions,
for natural selection.

00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:28.460
And when we think about how
cultural selection might work,

00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:32.870
when biological group selection
is usually ineffective--

00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:34.566
and, by the way,
there've been a lot of

00:16:34.566 --> 00:16:38.192
publications on this recently,
and they've been in high-end

00:16:38.192 --> 00:16:40.027
journals,
like Nature and

00:16:40.027 --> 00:16:42.445
Science--
we can see that one of the

00:16:42.445 --> 00:16:45.883
things that happens is that
social norms spread rapidly

00:16:45.883 --> 00:16:47.220
through imitation.
 

00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:50.960
So if, within a group,
a new social norm arises,

00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:54.509
it can spread through that
group and homogenize that group

00:16:54.509 --> 00:16:57.490
pretty rapidly,
simply because we are creatures

00:16:57.490 --> 00:17:00.433
that learn rapidly,
and we imitate others,

00:17:00.433 --> 00:17:03.190
and we respond to social
pressure,

00:17:03.190 --> 00:17:05.269
and to things like political
correctness.

00:17:05.269 --> 00:17:07.726
This is essentially a
description of the spread of

00:17:07.726 --> 00:17:08.930
political correctness.
 

00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:16.461
You can accelerate that spread
with moralistic punishment,

00:17:16.461 --> 00:17:20.150
and that will--that's a very,
very powerful force.

00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:24.592
Moralistic or altruistic
punishment is the following:

00:17:24.592 --> 00:17:29.461
I notice that Blake is doing
something that is violating a

00:17:29.461 --> 00:17:32.880
group norm, and I punish her for
it.

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:37.288
Blake doesn't like that,
and she elicits a- imposes a

00:17:37.288 --> 00:17:41.950
cost on me, for having the
effrontery to having punished

00:17:41.950 --> 00:17:43.900
her for doing that.
 

00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:46.433
However, my punishment
continues, and is strong enough

00:17:46.433 --> 00:17:48.730
finally to force Blake to obey
the group norm.

00:17:48.730 --> 00:17:52.797
In the process I have--she's
really elicited quite a bit of

00:17:52.797 --> 00:17:53.849
cost from me.
 

00:17:53.849 --> 00:17:55.160
Okay?
 

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:57.980
Perhaps I'm battered and
miserable, but she's behaving

00:17:57.980 --> 00:17:58.298
now.
 

00:17:58.298 --> 00:18:02.182
Well that's benefited everybody
in the group,

00:18:02.182 --> 00:18:03.328
at my cost.
 

00:18:03.328 --> 00:18:08.819
If there is any selection for
people who behave that way,

00:18:08.819 --> 00:18:11.096
who go around going, "Nah,
nah, nah, nah,

00:18:11.096 --> 00:18:15.625
nah," that will actually
accelerate the spread of social

00:18:15.625 --> 00:18:20.380
norms,
and rapidly make them uniform,

00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:22.380
within groups.
 

00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:26.940
Now part of the process of
cultural group selection would

00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:32.068
be the extinction of a group,
or the reproduction of a group.

00:18:32.068 --> 00:18:35.038
And the extinction of a group
culturally doesn't require

00:18:35.038 --> 00:18:36.660
biological group extinction.
 

00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:41.327
The Gauls did not die when they
were conquered by the Roman

00:18:41.327 --> 00:18:46.075
Empire, and stopped speaking
Celtic, and started speaking in

00:18:46.075 --> 00:18:46.880
Latin.
 

00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:51.153
There was a horizontal
transmission of a language that

00:18:51.153 --> 00:18:54.942
Latinized France and made it no
longer a Celtic,

00:18:54.942 --> 00:18:57.118
quasi-Germanic society.
 

00:18:57.118 --> 00:18:59.539
The people didn't die,
but the culture died.

00:19:03.058 --> 00:19:05.914
Or think of Tibet,
if you want a current day

00:19:05.914 --> 00:19:06.579
example.
 

00:19:09.778 --> 00:19:13.067
And cultural group reproduction
doesn't require biological group

00:19:13.067 --> 00:19:13.848
reproduction.
 

00:19:13.848 --> 00:19:16.363
So the Romans basically
reproduced their culture in

00:19:16.363 --> 00:19:17.619
France, 2000 years ago.
 

00:19:23.099 --> 00:19:25.029
A horrible statement, isn't it?
 

00:19:25.029 --> 00:19:26.890
Very true.
 

00:19:26.890 --> 00:19:29.884
I would challenge you to find
any individual who has ever

00:19:29.884 --> 00:19:32.588
lived on this planet,
who has lived at a time in

00:19:32.588 --> 00:19:35.318
which no war was going on
anywhere on the planet.

00:19:35.318 --> 00:19:39.354
Their own particular local
group might not have been in

00:19:39.354 --> 00:19:43.238
warfare, but it's almost
impossible to find a time in

00:19:43.238 --> 00:19:45.480
which war is not going on.
 

00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:49.135
I could put up a slide like
this, by the way,

00:19:49.135 --> 00:19:52.958
for China, and I'd have to
redefine the Y-axis,

00:19:52.958 --> 00:19:57.279
because the number of deaths is
so much greater.

00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:05.176
It's difficult to reconstruct
the demography of Central Asia,

00:20:05.176 --> 00:20:08.247
or of Africa,
but one can be pretty sure that

00:20:08.247 --> 00:20:10.690
similar graphs would be put up.
 

00:20:10.690 --> 00:20:17.200
And the take-home message,
when you look at this history,

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:23.256
is that humans--we think about
how nice we are and how

00:20:23.256 --> 00:20:27.369
aggressive those chimpanzees
are,

00:20:27.369 --> 00:20:28.818
and stuff like that.
 

00:20:28.818 --> 00:20:34.479
But if you were another
species, looking at the human

00:20:34.479 --> 00:20:40.029
race, you would say,
"Oh, they are B-A-M-Fs;

00:20:40.029 --> 00:20:42.460
they are bad-assed
mother-fuckers.

00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:44.170
&gt;
 

00:20:44.170 --> 00:20:46.769
And I use that--I thought,
should I use that term in an

00:20:46.769 --> 00:20:48.598
introductory biology lecture or
not?

00:20:48.598 --> 00:20:51.690
Should I drop that particular
linguistic bomb into the mix?

00:20:51.690 --> 00:20:53.872
And I decided yes,
because I want you to remember

00:20:53.872 --> 00:20:54.099
it.
 

00:20:54.099 --> 00:20:55.299
Okay?
 

00:20:55.299 --> 00:20:56.690
That's why I did it.
 

00:20:56.690 --> 00:20:59.400
Now we have some other evidence.
 

00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:01.048
Troy and Jericho.
 

00:21:01.048 --> 00:21:04.210
You go back in Jericho and you
go through forty-two layers of

00:21:04.210 --> 00:21:05.788
Jericho getting burned down.
 

00:21:05.788 --> 00:21:09.229
I've been to the museum in
Istanbul and I have looked at

00:21:09.229 --> 00:21:11.230
the excavation layers of Troy.
 

00:21:11.230 --> 00:21:13.470
The Trojan War was sack number
nine;

00:21:13.470 --> 00:21:16.358
or no, sack number six I think.
 

00:21:16.358 --> 00:21:22.618
And so Troy was burned down a
total of about fifteen times.

00:21:22.618 --> 00:21:26.961
You look into our great
mythologies, and they are all

00:21:26.961 --> 00:21:30.219
structured around warfare:
Iliad,

00:21:30.219 --> 00:21:33.558
Mahabharata,
Niebelungenlied.

00:21:33.558 --> 00:21:37.036
You look into the histories of
any of the civilizations that we

00:21:37.036 --> 00:21:39.559
have at hand,
you'll find that there's war.

00:21:39.559 --> 00:21:40.160
Okay?
 

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:43.509
So there's a lot of opportunity
for group performance to be

00:21:43.509 --> 00:21:45.298
tested by lethal competition.
 

00:21:45.298 --> 00:21:49.358
That's the take-home message of
the prevalence of warfare.

00:21:49.358 --> 00:21:52.696
Now the genetic differences
between early human groups

00:21:52.696 --> 00:21:56.538
probably were long enough- large
enough for lethal inter-group

00:21:56.538 --> 00:22:00.001
competition to account for the
evolution of altruism and

00:22:00.001 --> 00:22:02.269
cooperation within the groups.
 

00:22:02.269 --> 00:22:04.682
In other words,
we all have to band together,

00:22:04.682 --> 00:22:07.147
because if we don't cooperate
with each other,

00:22:07.147 --> 00:22:09.890
those guys next door are going
to wipe us out.

00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:12.368
And the necessary condition for
that,

00:22:12.368 --> 00:22:15.449
in the theoretical models,
is reproductive leveling within

00:22:15.449 --> 00:22:17.468
groups,
that's generated by food

00:22:17.468 --> 00:22:19.808
sharing beyond the immediate
family,

00:22:19.808 --> 00:22:23.223
that's generated by monogamy
and generated by other

00:22:23.223 --> 00:22:24.588
cooperative means.
 

00:22:24.588 --> 00:22:27.671
So this is--I told you,
this stuff is getting published

00:22:27.671 --> 00:22:29.839
in Science and
Nature.

00:22:29.839 --> 00:22:30.910
This is Sam Bowles.
 

00:22:30.910 --> 00:22:32.588
Sam's a Yale College graduate.
 

00:22:32.588 --> 00:22:38.702
His dad was Ambassador to
India, under John Kennedy,

00:22:38.702 --> 00:22:41.700
and Sam's an economist.
 

00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:44.220
And he's actually a fairly
committed group selectionist--

00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:49.182
so mainstream evolutionary
biologists look on his work with

00:22:49.182 --> 00:22:53.602
some skepticism,
because of that--but he's very

00:22:53.602 --> 00:22:59.280
much concerned about whether or
not there were conditions that

00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:04.773
would tend to take the selfish
Darwinian model of short-term

00:23:04.773 --> 00:23:08.034
selfishness--
homo economicus;

00:23:08.034 --> 00:23:11.086
strictly short-term,
selfish, rational--and tend to

00:23:11.086 --> 00:23:14.212
convert that into a person who
is more socially empathetic and

00:23:14.212 --> 00:23:17.344
more cooperative,
at least within the immediate

00:23:17.344 --> 00:23:17.838
group.
 

00:23:17.838 --> 00:23:23.460
So he's concerned with that
kind of process.

00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:27.006
Well we would very much like to
know, if this is going on,

00:23:27.006 --> 00:23:29.991
how a social norm,
like food sharing or monogamy,

00:23:29.991 --> 00:23:31.609
gets fixed in a group.
 

00:23:31.609 --> 00:23:33.680
Culture is very real.
 

00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:36.967
Cultural transmission is there,
and it's important,

00:23:36.967 --> 00:23:40.584
and it's different from
biological genetic transmission,

00:23:40.584 --> 00:23:42.819
and it's a fact on the ground.
 

00:23:42.819 --> 00:23:43.759
Okay?
 

00:23:43.759 --> 00:23:49.076
And you will find that,
if you look across the face of

00:23:49.076 --> 00:23:53.390
the earth, tremendous cultural
variation.

00:23:53.390 --> 00:23:58.138
And a group of people,
who are centered around Sam

00:23:58.138 --> 00:24:03.761
Bowles and Pete Richardson and
Rob Boyd and Joe Henrich and

00:24:03.761 --> 00:24:07.272
some others,
are arguing that cultural group

00:24:07.272 --> 00:24:10.400
selection will explain the
spread of social norms,

00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:13.308
that promote group cohesion and
group performance.

00:24:13.308 --> 00:24:17.250
So that one of the things that
happened is--

00:24:17.250 --> 00:24:19.613
language and cultural
transmission emerged in the

00:24:19.613 --> 00:24:21.973
human lineage,
and became important probably

00:24:21.973 --> 00:24:24.130
between about 100 and 50,000
years ago--

00:24:24.130 --> 00:24:26.480
is that this process could
start.

00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:29.618
And it's been commented on.
 

00:24:29.618 --> 00:24:35.400
There's a great Muslim
historiographer named Ibn

00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:36.630
Khaldun.
 

00:24:36.630 --> 00:24:38.890
He was kind of the Henry
Kissinger of his day.

00:24:38.890 --> 00:24:44.068
He was born in Andalucia,
in Southern Spain,

00:24:44.068 --> 00:24:47.420
and he was active politically
in kingdoms there,

00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:50.442
and in North Africa,
and he became the leading

00:24:50.442 --> 00:24:53.130
professor on the Law Faculty in
Cairo.

00:24:53.130 --> 00:24:56.769
And when Tamerlane,
Timur the Lame,

00:24:56.769 --> 00:25:00.830
invaded Syria--Timur the Lame
was one of Genghis Khan's

00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:04.388
descendants--
Ibn Khaldun went up,

00:25:04.388 --> 00:25:09.351
with the army from Egypt,
the Muslim army from Egypt,

00:25:09.351 --> 00:25:12.492
to defend Damascus,
and he was in Damascus when it

00:25:12.492 --> 00:25:14.934
was besieged,
and Tamerlane asked to meet

00:25:14.934 --> 00:25:17.140
him, because he was such a
famous guy.

00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:19.565
So he got lowered over the
walls of Damascus,

00:25:19.565 --> 00:25:21.770
in a basket,
and was taken to Tamerlane's

00:25:21.770 --> 00:25:24.416
camp, and gave us the only
written description of

00:25:24.416 --> 00:25:25.298
Tamerlane.
 

00:25:25.298 --> 00:25:27.490
Tamerlane himself was
illiterate.

00:25:27.490 --> 00:25:28.690
Okay?
 

00:25:28.690 --> 00:25:30.220
So this guy had an interesting
life.

00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:33.806
He also had the tragedy of
standing on the breakwater at

00:25:33.806 --> 00:25:35.573
Alexandria,
watching the ship,

00:25:35.573 --> 00:25:38.230
that was bringing his wife and
children in from Spain,

00:25:38.230 --> 00:25:40.470
sink in front of his eyes,
and they all drowned,

00:25:40.470 --> 00:25:42.019
in front of his eyes.
 

00:25:42.019 --> 00:25:47.189
So he was a guy who was marked
by intense political and human

00:25:47.189 --> 00:25:48.308
experience.
 

00:25:48.308 --> 00:25:53.022
And what he said was this:
It's religious propaganda that

00:25:53.022 --> 00:25:55.380
gives a dynasty its power.
 

00:25:55.380 --> 00:25:58.896
And he claims that that's how
the Arabs managed to achieve

00:25:58.896 --> 00:26:01.922
these great victories,
at the beginning of their

00:26:01.922 --> 00:26:04.040
conquests in 632,
when they radiated,

00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:06.487
after the death--
well it started with Muhammad,

00:26:06.487 --> 00:26:09.299
but shortly after his death
there was a real breakout and

00:26:09.299 --> 00:26:12.315
they conquered the Middle East
and spread across North Africa

00:26:12.315 --> 00:26:13.220
very rapidly.
 

00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:18.930
And in one case they were
fighting at Yarmouk,

00:26:18.930 --> 00:26:22.252
with 30,000,
against 120,000,

00:26:22.252 --> 00:26:26.710
and against Heracleus,
who was in the Eastern Roman

00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:29.653
Empire,
against 400,000 and neither of

00:26:29.653 --> 00:26:34.500
those big armies could withstand
the 30,000 Muslims who were

00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:38.558
fighting them,
and he claims it was religious

00:26:38.558 --> 00:26:43.288
propaganda that gave that
cultural force to that army.

00:26:43.288 --> 00:26:45.490
I recommend the
Muqaddimah.

00:26:45.490 --> 00:26:47.538
It's a very interesting piece
of work,

00:26:47.538 --> 00:26:52.417
a brilliant piece of work,
by a guy who was writing

00:26:52.417 --> 00:26:57.685
generally about problems of
politics and aggression and

00:26:57.685 --> 00:27:01.325
stabilization,
role of culture,

00:27:01.325 --> 00:27:06.345
in human life,
long before the Social Sciences

00:27:06.345 --> 00:27:10.920
really emerged as a field in the
West.

00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:12.618
How does a norm spread through
a group?

00:27:12.618 --> 00:27:15.335
How does something like that
propaganda spread through a

00:27:15.335 --> 00:27:15.730
group?
 

00:27:15.730 --> 00:27:19.279
Well we have--and this is one
of the places where perhaps

00:27:19.279 --> 00:27:23.147
biology is providing a handle
for culture--we have a number of

00:27:23.147 --> 00:27:24.670
learning mechanisms.
 

00:27:24.670 --> 00:27:27.597
One of them is to copy the
successful, the dominant,

00:27:27.597 --> 00:27:28.460
the frequent.
 

00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:31.490
You may not have thought
explicitly about it,

00:27:31.490 --> 00:27:35.134
but the whole point of
education is to try to keep you

00:27:35.134 --> 00:27:38.848
from having to learn everything
by trial and error,

00:27:38.848 --> 00:27:41.202
so that you don't have to
repeat all the mistakes of all

00:27:41.202 --> 00:27:43.940
of the previous generations of
all the humans who ever lived,

00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:45.740
in order to get to a certain
state of enlightenment,

00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:47.390
by the time you're
twenty-one-years-old.

00:27:47.390 --> 00:27:49.039
Well how do you do it?
 

00:27:49.039 --> 00:27:52.259
One of the ways is this.
 

00:27:52.259 --> 00:27:56.845
But that won't explain the
spread of an individually costly

00:27:56.845 --> 00:28:01.667
norm, like me trying to punish
somebody for violating a social

00:28:01.667 --> 00:28:02.380
norm.
 

00:28:05.578 --> 00:28:08.643
One can punish defectors from
group norms, even if it costs

00:28:08.643 --> 00:28:08.960
you.
 

00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:13.789
That's a very powerful force,
and it's powerful enough to

00:28:13.789 --> 00:28:17.500
overcome inherited biological
tendencies.

00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:20.176
So it's powerful enough to
explain why we get celibate nuns

00:28:20.176 --> 00:28:21.686
and priests,
why we get to declining

00:28:21.686 --> 00:28:23.608
birthrates,
why we get other things that

00:28:23.608 --> 00:28:25.589
reduce lifetime reproductive
success.

00:28:25.589 --> 00:28:29.160
How do we get it?
 

00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:32.098
Well it's not clear.
 

00:28:32.098 --> 00:28:35.505
By the way, there are now--if
you ever wanted to write a paper

00:28:35.505 --> 00:28:37.506
on this,
there are three or four models

00:28:37.506 --> 00:28:40.000
in the literature about how
altruistic punishment might

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:41.748
evolve,
and under what conditions it

00:28:41.748 --> 00:28:42.500
would be stable.
 

00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:46.349
You need to have pretty strong
inter-group conflict for it to

00:28:46.349 --> 00:28:46.799
work.
 

00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:52.940
And why would that happen?
 

00:28:52.940 --> 00:28:54.400
Why would we get altruism?
 

00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:57.613
Okay, here's Nathan Hale,
and his individual fitness was

00:28:57.613 --> 00:29:01.236
strikingly in conflict with the
social cohesion that was needed

00:29:01.236 --> 00:29:04.859
for the revolutionary American
army to resist the British.

00:29:04.859 --> 00:29:05.578
Okay?
 

00:29:05.578 --> 00:29:08.709
So this guy graduates from
Yale, and he's a school teacher

00:29:08.709 --> 00:29:10.903
down in New York,
and he's spying for the

00:29:10.903 --> 00:29:13.430
American Army,
and gets caught and hanged.

00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:16.380
And he was executed at age
twenty-one.

00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:17.660
He left no children.
 

00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:19.884
He said famously,
"I only regret that I have

00:29:19.884 --> 00:29:21.740
one life to give for my
country."

00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:24.000
And he's a social hero and a
Darwinian madman.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:25.230
&gt;
 

00:29:25.230 --> 00:29:26.410
Okay?
 

00:29:26.410 --> 00:29:27.000
That's the tension.
 

00:29:31.598 --> 00:29:33.788
So how can you resolve that
kind of conflict?

00:29:33.788 --> 00:29:35.440
Well there are actually a lot
of ways to do it.

00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:37.548
I've mentioned some of them
already, in the course.

00:29:37.548 --> 00:29:42.000
You can convert individual
stakes into common stakes,

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:45.640
so that whatever an individual
is going to get,

00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:48.951
out of living its life,
is going to be identified with

00:29:48.951 --> 00:29:52.200
whatever a group can get out of
performing better.

00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:57.269
Ecological constraint can be
imposed on the group;

00:29:57.269 --> 00:30:05.303
the threat of outside risk will
stabilize interactions within a

00:30:05.303 --> 00:30:06.338
group.
 

00:30:06.338 --> 00:30:10.808
One can cooperate with and
sacrifice for kin;

00:30:10.808 --> 00:30:13.160
that's just straightforward kin
selection.

00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:15.019
You all now know how that works.
 

00:30:15.019 --> 00:30:18.577
You can punish defectors;
that's the punishment of

00:30:18.577 --> 00:30:22.509
violators of social norms,
altruistic punishment.

00:30:22.509 --> 00:30:25.210
You can stabilize the division
of labor;

00:30:25.210 --> 00:30:27.308
that will certainly reduce
conflict,

00:30:27.308 --> 00:30:30.851
by making sure that say all the
people who are making shoes are

00:30:30.851 --> 00:30:34.450
not in conflict with all of the
people who are making shirts.

00:30:34.450 --> 00:30:35.900
They're actually cooperating
with each other;

00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:38.339
they're each making something
that the other one needs.

00:30:38.339 --> 00:30:40.420
It's win-win, for them.
 

00:30:40.420 --> 00:30:42.380
You can promote reciprocity.
 

00:30:42.380 --> 00:30:45.432
There could be cultural norms
to promote reciprocity,

00:30:45.432 --> 00:30:49.684
and that is the basis of trust;
and trust is the basis of

00:30:49.684 --> 00:30:50.890
cooperation.
 

00:30:50.890 --> 00:30:53.068
I'll step through these.
 

00:30:53.068 --> 00:30:55.328
How do you convert separate
stakes into common stakes?

00:30:55.328 --> 00:30:57.038
Well you know one of them
already.

00:30:57.038 --> 00:30:58.740
That's how you randomize
success.

00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:01.118
That's meiosis in the
parliament of the genes.

00:31:01.118 --> 00:31:04.869
Once you set up a mechanism
that means that every single

00:31:04.869 --> 00:31:09.097
gene in the genome has the same
probability of getting into the

00:31:09.097 --> 00:31:13.364
next generation,
then that is a structure that

00:31:13.364 --> 00:31:17.759
imposes homogeneity of success,
on all of those genes.

00:31:17.759 --> 00:31:25.130
Meiotic drivers violate it,
meiosis stabilizes it.

00:31:25.130 --> 00:31:27.753
At the cultural level you can
homogenize success with

00:31:27.753 --> 00:31:28.308
monogamy.
 

00:31:28.308 --> 00:31:30.200
So we have the Chinese
One-Child Law.

00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:32.230
You can share food with non-kin.
 

00:31:32.230 --> 00:31:36.099
And if competition within a
group is not an option,

00:31:36.099 --> 00:31:40.588
then the only path to better
performance is the performance

00:31:40.588 --> 00:31:42.368
of the whole group.
 

00:31:42.368 --> 00:31:47.519
So that's the rising tide lifts
all boats part of it.

00:31:47.519 --> 00:31:50.212
An example of imposing
ecological constraint:

00:31:50.212 --> 00:31:53.250
We can see in the meerkats,
they have sentinels,

00:31:53.250 --> 00:31:56.608
that altruistically look out
for predators and give alarm

00:31:56.608 --> 00:31:59.394
calls,
and larger groups of meerkats

00:31:59.394 --> 00:32:01.880
have better defense and offense.
 

00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:04.778
And if you leave the
group--this is a Cape Cobra;

00:32:04.778 --> 00:32:09.558
here are six meerkats
confronting a Cape Cobra.

00:32:09.558 --> 00:32:12.122
The six of them together have a
much better chance of dealing

00:32:12.122 --> 00:32:13.828
with it, than would one of them
alone.

00:32:13.828 --> 00:32:17.509
And there are Batteleur Eagles
and things like that,

00:32:17.509 --> 00:32:20.260
that are cruising the landscape
and that pick off meerkats cats

00:32:20.260 --> 00:32:22.450
pretty quickly,
if they're on their own.

00:32:22.450 --> 00:32:25.807
So if you- if it's very risky
not to be in a group,

00:32:25.807 --> 00:32:29.099
that will increase your
willingness to bear a cost

00:32:29.099 --> 00:32:31.250
imposed by group membership.
 

00:32:31.250 --> 00:32:34.298
In this particular species,
the cost imposed by group

00:32:34.298 --> 00:32:36.759
membership is that you can't
reproduce,

00:32:36.759 --> 00:32:38.665
if you're a female,
so long as the dominant

00:32:38.665 --> 00:32:39.619
female's in charge.
 

00:32:39.619 --> 00:32:41.690
She won't let you in the group.
 

00:32:41.690 --> 00:32:43.289
She'll kick you out if you try
to have a baby.

00:32:43.289 --> 00:32:44.538
That's a pretty strong cost.
 

00:32:44.538 --> 00:32:46.676
Nevertheless,
meerkats go into

00:32:46.676 --> 00:32:50.140
groups--okay?--because the
alternative is death,

00:32:50.140 --> 00:32:52.720
within about twenty-four hours.
 

00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:56.140
You can cooperate with and
sacrifice for kin.

00:32:56.140 --> 00:32:58.712
So multi-cellular organisms
integrate very easily,

00:32:58.712 --> 00:33:01.759
because they are clones that
originate in a single cell.

00:33:01.759 --> 00:33:03.730
So they're all 100% related to
each other.

00:33:03.730 --> 00:33:05.460
And you can see the division of
labor here,

00:33:05.460 --> 00:33:10.450
between the chlorophyll
producing cell,

00:33:10.450 --> 00:33:14.315
cells that are producing
carbohydrates and cells that are

00:33:14.315 --> 00:33:17.490
going to be actually reproducing
that group.

00:33:17.490 --> 00:33:20.180
This is in a multi-cellular
alga.

00:33:20.180 --> 00:33:22.798
This is a model for the origin
of multi-cellularity.

00:33:22.798 --> 00:33:25.364
It's well known,
from anthropological work,

00:33:25.364 --> 00:33:28.721
that many hunter-gatherer
groups consist mostly of close

00:33:28.721 --> 00:33:29.210
kin.
 

00:33:29.210 --> 00:33:32.737
There are interesting analyses
of asymmetries in that,

00:33:32.737 --> 00:33:35.798
and there's big controversy
over some of it.

00:33:35.798 --> 00:33:39.156
But it is nevertheless,
I think, a pretty safe broad

00:33:39.156 --> 00:33:43.240
generalization that many human
groups consist of close kin,

00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:45.835
and therefore we can expect
that kin selection has been

00:33:45.835 --> 00:33:48.375
operative,
and that it has been promoting

00:33:48.375 --> 00:33:51.068
cooperation,
altruism and sacrifice.

00:33:51.068 --> 00:33:55.297
You can punish defectors,
and in a multi-cellular body

00:33:55.297 --> 00:33:59.365
one can, for example,
eliminate the defecting cancer

00:33:59.365 --> 00:34:01.598
cells through apoptosis.
 

00:34:01.598 --> 00:34:04.844
So there certainly are ways
that the immune system does

00:34:04.844 --> 00:34:08.510
attack, and partially succeeds
in controlling cancer cells.

00:34:08.510 --> 00:34:13.210
And in social groups one can
punish those who break social

00:34:13.210 --> 00:34:13.869
norms.
 

00:34:13.869 --> 00:34:17.539
So I'm going through a series
now of analogies between

00:34:17.539 --> 00:34:20.864
multi-cellular organisms and
potentially emerging

00:34:20.864 --> 00:34:24.119
cultural-level group integration
in humans.

00:34:24.119 --> 00:34:26.989
You can stabilize the division
of labor.

00:34:26.989 --> 00:34:31.000
In biology that's done with
epigenetic mechanisms;

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:35.041
epigenetic information is what
stabilizes development and makes

00:34:35.041 --> 00:34:38.887
sure that brain cells stay brain
cells, and liver cells stay

00:34:38.887 --> 00:34:39.929
liver cells.
 

00:34:39.929 --> 00:34:42.391
And in culture we've got things
over history,

00:34:42.391 --> 00:34:43.956
like guilds,
classes, castes,

00:34:43.956 --> 00:34:45.860
professions,
job descriptions.

00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:48.795
There are all kinds of ways
that the division of labor gets

00:34:48.795 --> 00:34:50.010
stabilized culturally.
 

00:34:50.010 --> 00:34:52.579
You can promote reciprocity.
 

00:34:52.579 --> 00:34:55.034
In evolutionary biology it's
much easier to promote

00:34:55.034 --> 00:34:58.175
reciprocity in a two-dimensional
surface where people are playing

00:34:58.175 --> 00:35:01.699
against their neighbors,
than in a very well mixed kind

00:35:01.699 --> 00:35:02.469
of liquid.
 

00:35:02.469 --> 00:35:05.960
That's the basic take-home
message of Martin Nowak's work

00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:08.079
on the evolution of cooperation.
 

00:35:08.079 --> 00:35:11.391
And a way to stabilize
reciprocity culturally is

00:35:11.391 --> 00:35:13.929
through win-win economic
exchange.

00:35:13.929 --> 00:35:17.400
So transactions in which both
sides profit;

00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:19.420
that's the basis of business.
 

00:35:19.420 --> 00:35:23.137
So lots of ways to resolve or
suppress conflict,

00:35:23.137 --> 00:35:25.510
but there are some problems.
 

00:35:25.510 --> 00:35:28.248
If you're going to stabilize
conflict within a group,

00:35:28.248 --> 00:35:30.039
you very probably need a
leader.

00:35:30.039 --> 00:35:32.806
You need the leader both to
direct the collective within the

00:35:32.806 --> 00:35:35.134
group,
and you need the leader to

00:35:35.134 --> 00:35:39.235
basically take over foreign
policy &gt;

00:35:39.235 --> 00:35:42.460
, to deal with extra group
relationships.

00:35:42.460 --> 00:35:45.846
And in the multi-cellular body,
that's been done by the central

00:35:45.846 --> 00:35:48.286
nervous system,
and in the emerging social

00:35:48.286 --> 00:35:51.090
group, that's done by something
like a president.

00:35:51.090 --> 00:35:54.880
Well this guy wasn't selected
at random, and there are some

00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:55.469
issues.
 

00:35:55.469 --> 00:35:57.829
Groups need leaders.
 

00:35:57.829 --> 00:36:02.177
A psychological predisposition
to defer to authority is what

00:36:02.177 --> 00:36:06.010
would permit a strong,
unrelated leader to emerge.

00:36:06.010 --> 00:36:08.976
You might trust your dad or
your uncle, but the issue here

00:36:08.976 --> 00:36:11.735
is why is it that in groups
humans actually will trust

00:36:11.735 --> 00:36:13.610
somebody unrelated to lead them?
 

00:36:13.610 --> 00:36:16.554
That's, in other words,
going beyond the kin selection

00:36:16.554 --> 00:36:17.000
model.
 

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:20.043
Most of us, around the world,
really just want to be left

00:36:20.043 --> 00:36:22.722
alone to do our own thing,
and we would like to delegate

00:36:22.722 --> 00:36:24.938
to leaders this business,
this complicated business,

00:36:24.938 --> 00:36:26.539
of interacting with other
groups,

00:36:26.539 --> 00:36:28.280
particularly if it's aggressive.
 

00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:31.130
But that's a double-edged sword.
 

00:36:31.130 --> 00:36:32.179
Okay?
 

00:36:32.179 --> 00:36:34.670
Deference, which may have
evolved--

00:36:34.670 --> 00:36:39.364
this may be one of the human
social instincts that's kind of

00:36:39.364 --> 00:36:42.389
a handle on which culture can
pull--

00:36:42.389 --> 00:36:45.503
deference to leadership will
let a selfish leader exploit the

00:36:45.503 --> 00:36:45.969
public.
 

00:36:45.969 --> 00:36:48.239
And selfish leaders invade.
 

00:36:48.239 --> 00:36:50.989
They've got to be controlled,
while they're leading.

00:36:50.989 --> 00:36:53.490
And this is what the
U.S. Constitution is all

00:36:53.490 --> 00:36:54.059
about.
 

00:36:54.059 --> 00:36:56.960
A group that constrains its
leaders to pursue public

00:36:56.960 --> 00:37:00.543
interest will have a competitive
advantage, because they will be

00:37:00.543 --> 00:37:01.909
internally cohesive.
 

00:37:01.909 --> 00:37:05.757
If you have a long series of
defecting leaders who are

00:37:05.757 --> 00:37:09.170
corrupt and who subvert the
public interest,

00:37:09.170 --> 00:37:13.050
you will have the breakdown in
social reciprocity and trust,

00:37:13.050 --> 00:37:15.755
and you will end up with
situations which are similar

00:37:15.755 --> 00:37:18.380
today to Zimbabwe,
to the Congo,

00:37:18.380 --> 00:37:22.500
to Sudan, and other failed
states.

00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:25.893
So this defection is a recipe
for the creation of a failed

00:37:25.893 --> 00:37:26.369
state.
 

00:37:26.369 --> 00:37:28.875
Nevertheless,
leaders are motivated to

00:37:28.875 --> 00:37:30.840
defect, if they're selfish.
 

00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:36.045
Well let's take a quick look at
some very idealistic people in

00:37:36.045 --> 00:37:41.679
history who have tried to say we
should work for the group good.

00:37:41.679 --> 00:37:45.882
Christ; the invasion of the
Christian Church by the Borgia

00:37:45.882 --> 00:37:48.742
family,
and the remarkable situation of

00:37:48.742 --> 00:37:52.510
corruption in fourteenth and
fifteenth century Italy,

00:37:52.510 --> 00:37:56.467
where the Borgia's essentially
managed to make a personal

00:37:56.467 --> 00:37:59.929
fiefdom out of about a third of
Northern Italy.

00:37:59.929 --> 00:38:04.014
Karl Marx, who said a lot of
things that were quite similar

00:38:04.014 --> 00:38:06.733
to Christ,
and who tried to describe a

00:38:06.733 --> 00:38:10.876
very idealistic world in which
people were sharing property and

00:38:10.876 --> 00:38:14.619
were really cooperative and were
helping each other,

00:38:14.619 --> 00:38:17.050
getting subverted by the
nomenklatura;

00:38:17.050 --> 00:38:21.942
and again and again,
you find that selfish mutants

00:38:21.942 --> 00:38:23.440
are invading.
 

00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:28.239
The French Revolution, in 1789;
Liberté,

00:38:28.239 --> 00:38:31.025
Equalité,
Fraternité,

00:38:31.025 --> 00:38:35.516
was a very idealistic attempt
to overthrow a selfish

00:38:35.516 --> 00:38:39.628
aristocracy and establish--
kind of wipe the slate

00:38:39.628 --> 00:38:43.637
clean--and establish a new sort
of society that was much more

00:38:43.637 --> 00:38:44.639
egalitarian.
 

00:38:44.639 --> 00:38:47.851
And it rapidly got invaded by
this guy, who probably was

00:38:47.851 --> 00:38:51.355
responsible for more deaths of
young Frenchman than any other

00:38:51.355 --> 00:38:52.639
person in history.
 

00:38:52.639 --> 00:38:57.519
I think that Napoleon's armies
lost somewhere between 20,25

00:38:57.519 --> 00:38:59.539
million people;
a lot.

00:38:59.539 --> 00:39:03.293
A very dramatic and very
effective piece of data

00:39:03.293 --> 00:39:07.204
presentation showing the width
of Napoleon's army,

00:39:07.204 --> 00:39:10.320
as it went to Moscow and came
back.

00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:12.856
And it goes in as a river and
it comes back as a little line

00:39:12.856 --> 00:39:13.460
on the page.
 

00:39:16.809 --> 00:39:20.119
So there's a problem with
defecting leadership.

00:39:20.119 --> 00:39:24.547
And when you think about that,
you think about deference,

00:39:24.547 --> 00:39:26.840
patriotism, empathy,
trust;

00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:28.909
where do those emotions come
from?

00:39:28.909 --> 00:39:31.840
Where did guilt come from?
 

00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:33.280
Why do we get embarrassed?
 

00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:36.597
Do you think that it's
conceivable that an adult male

00:39:36.597 --> 00:39:39.340
grizzly bear is capable of
embarrassment?

00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:41.409
No way in hell.
 

00:39:41.409 --> 00:39:44.679
He's going to eat all those
babies wherever he can get them.

00:39:44.679 --> 00:39:47.449
Ditto male lion.
 

00:39:47.449 --> 00:39:49.010
Okay?
 

00:39:49.010 --> 00:39:51.219
I will forbear commentary on
provosts.

00:39:51.219 --> 00:39:55.300
Now outrage at defection,
where does that come from?

00:39:55.300 --> 00:39:56.530
Why do we want to punish
defectors?

00:39:56.530 --> 00:39:58.360
We're very sensitive to
defectors.

00:39:58.360 --> 00:40:03.590
We're very, very sensitive to
people who deceive us.

00:40:03.590 --> 00:40:05.900
Why do we have a desire for
revenge?

00:40:05.900 --> 00:40:11.150
Often that is a spiteful,
self-defeating kind of a thing.

00:40:11.150 --> 00:40:12.849
Why do we have an impulse to
conform?

00:40:12.849 --> 00:40:15.036
There's been lots of good
psychological studies on this

00:40:15.036 --> 00:40:16.503
one;
we have a frightening impulse

00:40:16.503 --> 00:40:17.010
to conform.
 

00:40:21.429 --> 00:40:24.331
Well the tribal social
instincts hypothesis,

00:40:24.331 --> 00:40:28.246
that Richardson and Boyd have
advanced, attempts to explain

00:40:28.246 --> 00:40:29.800
this kind of thing.
 

00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:32.440
They claim basically that gene
culture co-evolution built

00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:34.139
social imperatives into our
genes;

00:40:34.139 --> 00:40:37.007
that genes use hormones that
create emotions,

00:40:37.007 --> 00:40:40.934
that manipulate our phenotypes;
and that those emotions then

00:40:40.934 --> 00:40:44.170
are the biological handles on
which culture pulls.

00:40:44.170 --> 00:40:45.119
Okay?
 

00:40:45.119 --> 00:40:48.436
So that would be an assertion
that our minds are not blank

00:40:48.436 --> 00:40:50.438
slates,
and that we entered the world

00:40:50.438 --> 00:40:52.630
partially pre-programmed,
and that some of the

00:40:52.630 --> 00:40:54.369
programming is for social
interactions.

00:40:54.369 --> 00:40:56.670
That's a big claim.
 

00:40:56.670 --> 00:41:02.559
There's some evidence.
 

00:41:02.559 --> 00:41:04.961
Joe Henrich was one of Rob
Boyd's Ph.D.

00:41:04.961 --> 00:41:08.690
students, and Joe and Rob and
Pete Richardson and Sam Bowles

00:41:08.690 --> 00:41:12.295
and others got money from the
MacArthur Foundation to fund

00:41:12.295 --> 00:41:16.086
fifteen anthropologists to go
out and play the Ultimatum Game

00:41:16.086 --> 00:41:18.489
in fifteen different cultures.
 

00:41:18.489 --> 00:41:23.619
So the Ultimatum Game basically
works like this.

00:41:23.619 --> 00:41:27.155
I walk into a room with you
guys, and I've got in my hand

00:41:27.155 --> 00:41:29.619
enough money to make you
interested--

00:41:29.619 --> 00:41:32.373
let's say I've got
$1000.00--and I give the

00:41:32.373 --> 00:41:35.092
$1000.00 to Blake,
and I say, "Blake,

00:41:35.092 --> 00:41:36.320
here's how it works.
 

00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:38.909
You make him an offer,
and if he accepts it,

00:41:38.909 --> 00:41:41.199
that's the deal,
you get to keep it.

00:41:41.199 --> 00:41:42.822
If he turns it down,
neither of you gets

00:41:42.822 --> 00:41:43.530
anything."
 

00:41:43.530 --> 00:41:47.813
If Blake is homo-economicus,
a selfish Darwinian model,

00:41:47.813 --> 00:41:51.143
Blake will keep $999.00,
and offer him one,

00:41:51.143 --> 00:41:55.190
on the hypothesis that one is
better than zero.

00:41:55.190 --> 00:41:57.599
Okay?
 

00:41:57.599 --> 00:41:59.139
So that's the Ultimatum Game.
 

00:41:59.139 --> 00:42:01.469
And if he says,
"That's totally unfair.

00:42:01.469 --> 00:42:02.690
I'm not accepting it.
 

00:42:02.690 --> 00:42:03.559
Go to hell."
 

00:42:03.559 --> 00:42:04.539
Then neither of them gets
anything.

00:42:04.539 --> 00:42:05.780
Okay?
 

00:42:05.780 --> 00:42:08.260
That's why it's called the
Ultimatum Game.

00:42:08.260 --> 00:42:12.050
Well all cultures tested
rejected complete selfishness.

00:42:12.050 --> 00:42:13.829
Everybody demanded some degree
of fairness.

00:42:13.829 --> 00:42:18.340
The worst that anybody was able
to accept was 200 bucks;

00:42:18.340 --> 00:42:24.110
so 800/200, that was the worst.
 

00:42:24.110 --> 00:42:27.269
They varied in how much
selfishness they tolerated,

00:42:27.269 --> 00:42:30.809
and the amount of selfishness
was actually related to the

00:42:30.809 --> 00:42:32.579
cohesion of the culture.
 

00:42:32.579 --> 00:42:35.619
So the ones that demanded the
most--

00:42:35.619 --> 00:42:38.530
so, for example,
the one that would say--

00:42:38.530 --> 00:42:42.599
say Blake offers you $500.00,
and you say no,

00:42:42.599 --> 00:42:44.750
but she offers you 600 and you
say yes,

00:42:44.750 --> 00:42:47.711
and she only gets 400--that
would be the Lamalera whale

00:42:47.711 --> 00:42:48.920
hunters of Malaysia.
 

00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:51.529
They get into small boats,
unrelated people get into a

00:42:51.529 --> 00:42:54.434
small boat and go out to hunt
whales, and their lives depend

00:42:54.434 --> 00:42:56.679
upon each other;
it's dangerous business.

00:42:56.679 --> 00:42:59.215
So unrelated people are
cooperating, and they're

00:42:59.215 --> 00:43:00.780
literally in the same boat.
 

00:43:00.780 --> 00:43:01.380
Okay?
 

00:43:01.380 --> 00:43:04.360
They're the ones that demand
the most fairness.

00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:07.159
The ones that demand the least,
the twenty-percenters,

00:43:07.159 --> 00:43:10.500
are scattered,
wandering, single-family groups

00:43:10.500 --> 00:43:14.360
of Native American Indians in
the Peruvian jungle.

00:43:14.360 --> 00:43:17.963
They have very little social
interchange and very little

00:43:17.963 --> 00:43:20.844
economic life,
and they are willing to accept

00:43:20.844 --> 00:43:21.969
20%;
but that's the minimum.

00:43:21.969 --> 00:43:24.909
Okay?
 

00:43:24.909 --> 00:43:28.490
So it seems that for social
emotions, biology is important,

00:43:28.490 --> 00:43:30.530
culture does make a difference.
 

00:43:30.530 --> 00:43:31.949
Biology is providing a
principle;

00:43:31.949 --> 00:43:33.619
culture's setting the
parameters.

00:43:33.619 --> 00:43:37.367
That's kind of like language,
the way that Chomsky thought of

00:43:37.367 --> 00:43:37.679
it.
 

00:43:37.679 --> 00:43:41.760
And it looks like we display a
lot of symptoms of group

00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:42.820
adaptations.
 

00:43:42.820 --> 00:43:45.590
The mechanisms that might have
selected them are plausible;

00:43:45.590 --> 00:43:48.179
they're not yet strongly
supported.

00:43:48.179 --> 00:43:50.639
So are we going to fuse into a
group identity,

00:43:50.639 --> 00:43:53.376
or are we going to remain torn
between private interests and

00:43:53.376 --> 00:43:55.280
those of the group to which we
belong,

00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:57.460
which is our current state?
 

00:43:57.460 --> 00:44:00.760
Well, when we went from
transition- when we transitioned

00:44:00.760 --> 00:44:04.059
from hunger-gatherers into
agricultural settlements,

00:44:04.059 --> 00:44:06.460
the relationships among group
members decreased,

00:44:06.460 --> 00:44:08.880
group size increased,
and the average encounter was

00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:11.400
no longer with a relative but
with a non-relative.

00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:12.469
That's a big city.
 

00:44:12.469 --> 00:44:13.179
Okay?
 

00:44:13.179 --> 00:44:17.130
There weren't any cities before
agriculture.

00:44:17.130 --> 00:44:21.239
Now we then started getting
engaged in large-scale economic

00:44:21.239 --> 00:44:25.277
exchange, and it both reinforces
and erodes cultural group

00:44:25.277 --> 00:44:26.268
selection.
 

00:44:26.268 --> 00:44:29.550
So exchange within groups
promotes group cohesion;

00:44:29.550 --> 00:44:32.699
exchange among groups erodes
group boundaries.

00:44:32.699 --> 00:44:36.429
This is a diagram of global
trade a few years ago;

00:44:36.429 --> 00:44:39.530
the width of the arrows is how
much is flowing.

00:44:39.530 --> 00:44:44.023
It shows, as the current
economic crisis just shows so

00:44:44.023 --> 00:44:47.922
clearly, that we are now
globally integrated by

00:44:47.922 --> 00:44:49.110
economics.
 

00:44:49.110 --> 00:44:52.773
So group boundaries are being
strongly eroded by

00:44:52.773 --> 00:44:54.018
globalization.
 

00:44:54.018 --> 00:44:56.820
Our group identity is now
multi-dimensional.

00:44:56.820 --> 00:44:58.840
So it used to be,
if you were in a

00:44:58.840 --> 00:45:01.157
hunter-gatherer band,
or even if you were in a

00:45:01.157 --> 00:45:03.280
medieval guild,
that your ethnicity,

00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:07.309
your religion and your politics
pretty much overlap.

00:45:07.309 --> 00:45:12.019
But it's now possible for
people to belong to different

00:45:12.019 --> 00:45:16.119
dimensions of identity,
all at the same time.

00:45:16.119 --> 00:45:22.355
So you can be a Black Catholic
Democrat, or you can be a Black

00:45:22.355 --> 00:45:24.400
Muslim Republican.
 

00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:26.800
Right?
 

00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:28.329
And that didn't used to be
possible.

00:45:28.329 --> 00:45:30.619
Those things are now breaking
apart.

00:45:30.619 --> 00:45:34.253
So the power of cultural group
selection is decreasing,

00:45:34.253 --> 00:45:38.021
because these things are not
adding up to push all in the

00:45:38.021 --> 00:45:40.280
same direction;
they're pushing in different

00:45:40.280 --> 00:45:40.699
directions.
 

00:45:43.860 --> 00:45:45.530
In the evolutionary social
sciences,

00:45:45.530 --> 00:45:47.936
by which I mean basically
economic psychology and

00:45:47.936 --> 00:45:50.148
political science,
we're stuck in the major

00:45:50.148 --> 00:45:52.130
transition between individual
and group.

00:45:52.130 --> 00:45:53.929
There's quite a bit of support
for that.

00:45:53.929 --> 00:45:57.021
The transition stalled,
and the breakdown has left us

00:45:57.021 --> 00:45:58.449
in a state of tension.
 

00:45:58.449 --> 00:46:02.353
But, these conclusions are
supported by plausibility

00:46:02.353 --> 00:46:04.764
arguments,
and these plausibility

00:46:04.764 --> 00:46:08.690
arguments basically only achieve
the level of consistency with

00:46:08.690 --> 00:46:09.719
the evidence.
 

00:46:09.719 --> 00:46:13.030
Consistency is a weak logical
criterion.

00:46:13.030 --> 00:46:16.458
There's a lot of stuff that's
consistent, but not necessarily

00:46:16.458 --> 00:46:16.860
true.
 

00:46:16.860 --> 00:46:19.777
It is much more difficult to
demonstrate necessity and

00:46:19.777 --> 00:46:20.550
sufficiency.
 

00:46:20.550 --> 00:46:23.105
Basically to do that,
you have to take the Social

00:46:23.105 --> 00:46:26.139
Sciences and transform them into
the Natural Sciences,

00:46:26.139 --> 00:46:29.268
with the same standards of
experimental demonstration and

00:46:29.268 --> 00:46:30.610
admission of evidence.
 

00:46:30.610 --> 00:46:34.420
Well that is a long-term,
big project.

00:46:34.420 --> 00:46:35.690
That's not easy.
 

00:46:35.690 --> 00:46:39.257
So I say that,
at the end, because I don't

00:46:39.257 --> 00:46:44.130
want to leave you with the
impression that this idea,

00:46:44.130 --> 00:46:46.050
that we're stuck in a major
transition,

00:46:46.050 --> 00:46:47.969
is well established.
 

00:46:47.969 --> 00:46:51.356
I think that it is consistent
with the evidence that I know

00:46:51.356 --> 00:46:54.099
of, but I don't think the
evidence is strong.

00:46:58.699 --> 00:47:00.074
And of course,
down in my gut,

00:47:00.074 --> 00:47:01.780
when I take off my scientist
hat,

00:47:01.780 --> 00:47:04.987
and my teacher hat,
and I am sitting there alone

00:47:04.987 --> 00:47:08.021
quietly at 2:00 in the morning,
in my house,

00:47:08.021 --> 00:47:10.929
thinking about this,
I think it's probably true.

00:47:10.929 --> 00:47:12.219
&gt;
 

00:47:12.219 --> 00:47:13.019
Okay.

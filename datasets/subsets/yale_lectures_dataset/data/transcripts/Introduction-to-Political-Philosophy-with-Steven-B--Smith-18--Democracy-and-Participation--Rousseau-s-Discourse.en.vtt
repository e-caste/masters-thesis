00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:07.730
Professor Steven Smith:
I hope that everybody followed

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:11.488
Rousseau's advice and yesterday
exercised your rights as

00:00:11.488 --> 00:00:13.470
citizens of a free state.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.282
We hope so.
I begin today with an apology

00:00:23.282 --> 00:00:29.086
and that is for the particular
edition that you're using for

00:00:29.086 --> 00:00:33.120
this section of the class on
Rousseau.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.887
This is the only edition that
I've assigned in the course that

00:00:37.887 --> 00:00:43.130
I don't like.
Why did I assign it?

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.992
Because I want us to read the
Second Discourse,

00:00:46.992 --> 00:00:50.710
the Discourse on
Inequality and the Social

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.937
Contract and this is the
only edition that I could find

00:00:54.937 --> 00:00:59.091
where they are both in the same
volume and I don't have to

00:00:59.091 --> 00:01:04.694
assign two separate books.
So, in order to keep your costs

00:01:04.694 --> 00:01:10.137
down, I bit the bullet and
assigned a translation in an

00:01:10.137 --> 00:01:14.269
edition I don't particularly
care for.

00:01:14.269 --> 00:01:17.610
A far superior edition is found
in this.

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:23.141
This is one of the two volumes,
the Cambridge Bluebook series

00:01:23.141 --> 00:01:26.737
as it's called,
edited and translated by

00:01:26.737 --> 00:01:30.433
Gourevitch.
If anybody wants to do more

00:01:30.433 --> 00:01:34.887
advanced work in Rousseau,
you will no doubt get this

00:01:34.887 --> 00:01:37.154
edition,
better translations,

00:01:37.154 --> 00:01:40.663
better notes and so on,
of the Second Discourse

00:01:40.663 --> 00:01:44.040
and The Social Contract
and for anybody who's

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.408
interested,
I've decided because Rousseau

00:01:48.408 --> 00:01:54.569
has become so important to me,
that next year I will be

00:01:54.569 --> 00:02:00.502
offering an undergraduate
seminar entirely devoted to

00:02:00.502 --> 00:02:04.173
Rousseau.
He's one of the handful of

00:02:04.173 --> 00:02:06.885
writers, of political
philosophers,

00:02:06.885 --> 00:02:10.449
to whom one could,
in all justice,

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:17.756
devote an entire semester to
his writings and that's what I

00:02:17.756 --> 00:02:24.686
want to do next year.
So if any of you should get the

00:02:24.686 --> 00:02:31.239
bug, the Rousseau bug,
next year we'll do Rousseau in

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:35.020
many more texts,
in detail.

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:40.370
So with that having been said,
I'm going to talk today about a

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.580
remarkable, remarkable human
being and writer.

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:49.977
It's a very common way of
entering the thought of Rousseau

00:02:49.977 --> 00:02:53.669
to see him as a critic of
liberalism,

00:02:53.669 --> 00:02:59.988
of the kind of property owning,
rights-based society given

00:02:59.988 --> 00:03:06.528
expression by John Locke and I
will talk about that a little

00:03:06.528 --> 00:03:10.666
bit later.
But to see Rousseau as a critic

00:03:10.666 --> 00:03:16.005
of Lockean liberalism would be I
think very shortsighted and very

00:03:16.005 --> 00:03:19.589
unfair.
Rousseau was a product not of

00:03:19.589 --> 00:03:24.805
liberal society but rather of
the ancien régime,

00:03:24.805 --> 00:03:30.259
the old regime in France.
Rousseau was born in 1712.

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:34.384
It was two years before the
death of the famous Sun King,

00:03:34.384 --> 00:03:38.509
Louis XIV, a man who symbolized
the age of absolutism,

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:43.817
and he died in 1778
approximately a decade before

00:03:43.817 --> 00:03:48.240
the outbreak of the French
Revolution.

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:52.862
His life, in other words,
was lived entirely within the

00:03:52.862 --> 00:03:56.714
waning decades,
the waning years of the age of

00:03:56.714 --> 00:04:01.080
absolutism in France and in
continental Europe.

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:06.283
Rousseau was deeply aware that
he lived in an age of transition

00:04:06.283 --> 00:04:11.569
but what precisely would come
after he was by no means clear.

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:17.348
He wrote, as you will see,
with the passion and the

00:04:17.348 --> 00:04:24.283
intensity of someone who fully
expected to be instrumental in

00:04:24.283 --> 00:04:31.217
the coming of a new historical
and political epoch and indeed

00:04:31.217 --> 00:04:34.560
he was.
Rousseau was Swiss.

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.440
He was not French.
He was a Swiss.

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.613
He signed many of his most
important words simply

00:04:42.613 --> 00:04:46.612
citoyen de Gèneve,
a citizen of Geneva,

00:04:46.612 --> 00:04:49.829
after the city where he was
born.

00:04:49.829 --> 00:04:55.236
He was the son of an artisan
who abandoned his family after a

00:04:55.236 --> 00:04:59.832
falling out with the local
authorities and the young

00:04:59.832 --> 00:05:05.509
Rousseau was apprenticed to an
engraver but he left Geneva;

00:05:05.509 --> 00:05:11.720
he fled Geneva for good at the
age of 16.

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:17.069
For the following 16 years,
Rousseau lived a kind of

00:05:17.069 --> 00:05:22.420
vagabond varied life doing many
different things,

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:27.149
working as a music instructor
and a transcriber.

00:05:27.149 --> 00:05:32.726
He was the secretary to the
French Ambassador in the city of

00:05:32.726 --> 00:05:38.492
Venice and he was also the lover
of a wealthy woman many years

00:05:38.492 --> 00:05:43.350
his senior.
After moving to Paris in 1744,

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:48.970
Rousseau spent several years
eking out a living,

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:55.056
sort of on the margins of the
Parisian literary scene until

00:05:55.056 --> 00:05:58.730
1750 when he published his
first,

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:02.399
although quite brief major
essay, a work called The

00:06:02.399 --> 00:06:05.490
Discourse on the Arts and the
Sciences,

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:10.829
which catapulted him to
literary fame.

00:06:10.829 --> 00:06:14.254
That work made his name so it
was--it came to be called the

00:06:14.254 --> 00:06:18.361
First Discourse.
That work was followed five

00:06:18.361 --> 00:06:24.012
years later in 1755 by the work
we will be reading starting

00:06:24.012 --> 00:06:26.690
today,
The Discourse on the Origins

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:29.071
of Inequality,
often simply called the

00:06:29.071 --> 00:06:32.685
Second Discourse,
and that work was followed

00:06:32.685 --> 00:06:37.092
later on in 1762 with the
Social Contract and also

00:06:37.092 --> 00:06:41.734
the same year that Rousseau
published his major massive work

00:06:41.734 --> 00:06:45.747
on political education called
Émile or On

00:06:45.747 --> 00:06:49.279
Education,
both in 1762.

00:06:49.279 --> 00:06:54.294
During this period,
Rousseau fathered five

00:06:54.294 --> 00:06:58.844
children.
He abandoned all of them to an

00:06:58.844 --> 00:07:02.216
orphanage.
He did so with a common-law

00:07:02.216 --> 00:07:06.853
wife with whom he lived and
during this times the writings

00:07:06.853 --> 00:07:11.246
I've mentioned are only a small
portion although a very

00:07:11.246 --> 00:07:15.639
important portion of the
writings which he lived.

00:07:15.639 --> 00:07:18.393
He was also the author of a
very large novel,

00:07:18.393 --> 00:07:20.959
Heloise,
The New Heloise,

00:07:20.959 --> 00:07:24.481
La Nouvelle Heloise,
which was a bestseller in his

00:07:24.481 --> 00:07:28.066
time and it was a kind of
philosophical novel that helped-

00:07:28.066 --> 00:07:32.101
that explored many of his ideas.
He was the composer of an

00:07:32.101 --> 00:07:35.786
opera, Le Devin du
Village, that was performed

00:07:35.786 --> 00:07:40.026
at the court of Louis XV.
He also wrote several very

00:07:40.026 --> 00:07:44.540
important and interesting
volumes of autobiography,

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:48.368
the most--the best known of
which is simply called

00:07:48.368 --> 00:07:52.899
Confessions after the
work of Saint Augustine of the

00:07:52.899 --> 00:07:57.743
title--a book of the same name
and he also wrote another volume

00:07:57.743 --> 00:08:02.353
of autobiography in a dialog
form called Rousseau Juge de

00:08:02.353 --> 00:08:06.650
Jean Jacques in which he
divides himself up into two

00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:10.917
different people,
Rousseau and Jean Jacques,

00:08:10.917 --> 00:08:14.899
in a kind of internal
interrogation of himself.

00:08:14.899 --> 00:08:20.695
Rousseau wrote in many and
varied genres and his work spans

00:08:20.695 --> 00:08:23.992
the entire gamut of
philosophical,

00:08:23.992 --> 00:08:30.144
literary and political themes.
He was also the writer of

00:08:30.144 --> 00:08:34.000
different constitutional
projects.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.790
He was consulted by heads of
state in his period and wrote

00:08:38.790 --> 00:08:43.748
constitutions for Poland and for
the small island country of

00:08:43.748 --> 00:08:48.622
Corsica which he said in the
Social Contract was the

00:08:48.622 --> 00:08:53.748
only place in Europe that one
might expect great things and of

00:08:53.748 --> 00:08:57.529
course he was right as anybody
knows,

00:08:57.529 --> 00:09:00.958
a generation or two later the
famous Corsican,

00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:04.540
yes, who put an end…Who am I
talking about?

00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:09.370
Napoleon, of course.
You might say he was right.

00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:14.374
He helped to substitute the
general's will for the general

00:09:14.374 --> 00:09:19.283
will but that was Rousseau.
People have been very baffled

00:09:19.283 --> 00:09:23.440
by exactly the nature of
Rousseau's contributions.

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:26.920
What did he believe?
What did he stand for?

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:31.680
What do his writings represent?
Was he a revolutionary whose

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:35.904
work helped to inspire the
radical phases of the French

00:09:35.904 --> 00:09:37.727
Revolution?
Just remember,

00:09:37.727 --> 00:09:39.858
for example,
you've probably all heard the

00:09:39.858 --> 00:09:42.820
famous opening sentence of the
Social Contract,

00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:47.620
"man is born free but is
everywhere in chains," his

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:53.187
appeal to the severe political
ethics of ancient Sparta and

00:09:53.187 --> 00:09:57.700
Rome as well as his belief that
the people,

00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:02.435
in their collective capacity,
are the only legitimate source

00:10:02.435 --> 00:10:07.212
of sovereignty.
All of these seemed to pave the

00:10:07.212 --> 00:10:13.377
way for the revolutionary
politics of the late eighteenth

00:10:13.377 --> 00:10:17.340
century and up into our own
time.

00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:21.056
So is Rousseau a kind of
incendiary and revolutionary or

00:10:21.056 --> 00:10:25.313
did his writings seek to release
us altogether from the bonds of

00:10:25.313 --> 00:10:29.570
society as he appears to do in
the Second Discourse,

00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:31.330
in the Discourse on
Inequality?

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:34.775
In this work,
Rousseau seems to lay the basis

00:10:34.775 --> 00:10:38.769
for the kind of romantic
individualism that would be

00:10:38.769 --> 00:10:43.232
associated with people like
Wordsworth in England or Henry

00:10:43.232 --> 00:10:48.271
David Thoreau in America.
Rousseau's direct appeals to

00:10:48.271 --> 00:10:53.215
Nature as well as his
celebration of the simplicity of

00:10:53.215 --> 00:10:58.719
peasant life and rural life
seemed to open the door later on

00:10:58.719 --> 00:11:04.316
to writers like Tolstoy as well
as to various kinds of social

00:11:04.316 --> 00:11:09.539
experiments in rural communal
utopianism such as,

00:11:09.539 --> 00:11:12.509
for example,
the Israeli kibbutz movement,

00:11:12.509 --> 00:11:16.710
which is in its own way a
direct descendant of Rousseau.

00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:21.460
So my suggestion is Rousseau's
writings are varied and his

00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:25.460
influence has been manifold,
to say the least.

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:33.558
He both helps to bring to
fruition and completion the

00:11:33.558 --> 00:11:37.669
political and intellectual
movement that we know as the

00:11:37.669 --> 00:11:41.255
Enlightenment.
He brings this to its highest

00:11:41.255 --> 00:11:43.775
phase of perfection,
in many ways,

00:11:43.775 --> 00:11:47.518
and at the same time he was a
severe critic of the

00:11:47.518 --> 00:11:51.152
Enlightenment.
He was a close friend and

00:11:51.152 --> 00:11:56.302
associate of men like Diderot,
who was the general editor of

00:11:56.302 --> 00:12:01.330
the Encyclopedia,
the great French contribution

00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:06.580
to the age of the Enlightenment,
and yet he excoriated the

00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:12.105
progress of the arts and the
sciences and worried about their

00:12:12.105 --> 00:12:16.250
effect on the moral life of
communities.

00:12:16.250 --> 00:12:19.129
He was a writer who wore
different hats.

00:12:19.129 --> 00:12:23.677
He defended what he called the
savage, sauvage,

00:12:23.677 --> 00:12:28.519
against the civilized man.
He took the side of the poor

00:12:28.519 --> 00:12:33.487
and the dispossessed against the
elites and he adopted the

00:12:33.487 --> 00:12:38.454
posture of the loyal son and
citizen of Geneva against the

00:12:38.454 --> 00:12:43.159
sophisticated Parisian
intellectuals of his time.

00:12:43.159 --> 00:12:47.149
So who was Rousseau and what
did he stand for?

00:12:47.149 --> 00:12:51.348
That's what I want us to begin
to try to find out a little

00:12:51.348 --> 00:12:52.380
about today.

00:13:04.909 --> 00:13:08.965
The Second Discourse,
the Discourse on

00:13:08.965 --> 00:13:12.847
Inequality,
is in the eyes of many readers

00:13:12.847 --> 00:13:17.316
Rousseau's greatest work.
I'm not sure if that's true but

00:13:17.316 --> 00:13:21.388
many people believe it is.
It is what writers in the

00:13:21.388 --> 00:13:26.009
eighteenth century called a
conjectural history.

00:13:26.009 --> 00:13:29.538
It is, that is to say,
a kind of philosophical

00:13:29.538 --> 00:13:34.479
history, really that is to say a
philosophical reconstruction of

00:13:34.479 --> 00:13:37.632
history,
but not of what actually

00:13:37.632 --> 00:13:41.975
happened in the past.
It's not a history of facts and

00:13:41.975 --> 00:13:46.231
dates but it is a history
Rousseau believes of what had to

00:13:46.231 --> 00:13:50.191
have happened for,
in a way, human beings to

00:13:50.191 --> 00:13:53.539
evolve to their current
condition.

00:13:53.539 --> 00:13:57.934
Rousseau begins the work by
comparing the effects of history

00:13:57.934 --> 00:14:02.105
on us to the statue of Glaucus
that he says the winds and

00:14:02.105 --> 00:14:06.574
storms had so disfigured that it
scarcely looked like a human

00:14:06.574 --> 00:14:10.329
being at all.
This is what history and time

00:14:10.329 --> 00:14:13.446
has done to us.
It has so affected and

00:14:13.446 --> 00:14:18.759
transformed human nature that if
we want to understand what human

00:14:18.759 --> 00:14:22.432
nature really is,
he argues, it is necessary to

00:14:22.432 --> 00:14:26.110
reconstruct it through a kind of
thought experiment.

00:14:53.789 --> 00:15:01.485
Rousseau compares the
Second--Oh,

00:15:01.485 --> 00:15:04.070
God.
Oh, dear.

00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:20.861
All right.
Rousseau--Bad to laugh at your

00:15:20.861 --> 00:15:26.866
own jokes.
He compares the Second

00:15:26.866 --> 00:15:30.702
Discourse to an experiment
like those undertaken by

00:15:30.702 --> 00:15:35.037
physicists and cosmologists in
his own day who speculate about

00:15:35.037 --> 00:15:38.802
the origins of the universe in
the same way that he is

00:15:38.802 --> 00:15:43.350
speculating about the original
condition of human nature.

00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:46.308
That is to say,
there is no empirical or

00:15:46.308 --> 00:15:50.783
physical evidence to draw on to
understand how the world was

00:15:50.783 --> 00:15:53.516
actually framed.
We can only make,

00:15:53.516 --> 00:15:57.095
he says, intelligent guesses,
certain inferences or

00:15:57.095 --> 00:16:01.389
conjectures based on the
evidence that we find around us.

00:16:01.389 --> 00:16:04.577
And so Rousseau remarks,
in one of the most arresting

00:16:04.577 --> 00:16:08.372
passages from his book,
and Rousseau was a man known

00:16:08.372 --> 00:16:12.089
for writing arresting
paradoxical and ingenious

00:16:12.089 --> 00:16:15.214
sentences,
he writes, "let us therefore

00:16:15.214 --> 00:16:19.732
begin by putting aside all the
facts, let us put all the facts

00:16:19.732 --> 00:16:23.139
aside for they have no bearing
on the case.

00:16:23.139 --> 00:16:26.827
The investigation that may be
undertaken concerning this

00:16:26.827 --> 00:16:30.379
subject should not be taken for
historical truths,"

00:16:30.379 --> 00:16:34.208
he says, "but only for
hypothetical and conditional

00:16:34.208 --> 00:16:36.321
reasonings."
In other words,

00:16:36.321 --> 00:16:40.070
what he's saying is that the
history that he intends to

00:16:40.070 --> 00:16:42.639
unfold is an experiment much
like,

00:16:42.639 --> 00:16:46.454
again, that undertaken by
geologists who try to infer the

00:16:46.454 --> 00:16:50.268
development of plant or animal
life from the existence of

00:16:50.268 --> 00:16:53.470
certain fossil remains or
skeletal remains.

00:16:53.470 --> 00:16:56.980
And yet, at the same time,
while Rousseau speaks of his

00:16:56.980 --> 00:16:59.190
work as tentative,
experimental,

00:16:59.190 --> 00:17:02.312
conjectural,
he has only hazarded some

00:17:02.312 --> 00:17:06.364
guesses, he writes,
you cannot help but be struck

00:17:06.364 --> 00:17:10.246
by the certain tone of
confidence with which he

00:17:10.246 --> 00:17:13.516
presents his findings.
In particular,

00:17:13.516 --> 00:17:17.466
he discusses and rejects quite
emphatically the investigations

00:17:17.466 --> 00:17:20.509
of his predecessors both ancient
and modern.

00:17:20.509 --> 00:17:23.641
"The philosophers," he writes,
"who have examined the

00:17:23.641 --> 00:17:27.376
foundations of society have all
felt the necessity of returning

00:17:27.376 --> 00:17:30.990
to the state of nature but none
of them has reached it,"

00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:35.119
Rousseau says.
He believes that he alone has

00:17:35.119 --> 00:17:38.250
finally, as it were,
struck gold.

00:17:38.250 --> 00:17:41.980
"Oh, man," he exclaims,
"oh, man, whatever country you

00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:44.935
may be from, whatever your
opinions may be,

00:17:44.935 --> 00:17:48.254
listen.
Here is your history as I have

00:17:48.254 --> 00:17:52.494
thought to read it,
not in the books of your fellow

00:17:52.494 --> 00:17:56.820
men who are liars but in nature
who never lies."

00:17:56.820 --> 00:18:00.116
That's a remarkable sentence.
For the first time,

00:18:00.116 --> 00:18:03.232
Rousseau says,
human nature will be revealed

00:18:03.232 --> 00:18:07.000
and the history of civil society
explained to us.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.900
Listen.
Here is your history,

00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:13.071
as I have read it,
not through other books but

00:18:13.071 --> 00:18:17.389
through nature,
he says, that seems to speak

00:18:17.389 --> 00:18:22.400
directly to me or to which I
have an insight.

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:26.130
So what is the state of nature,
a term that we've been looking

00:18:26.130 --> 00:18:29.586
at in Hobbes and Locke?
What is it that Rousseau thinks

00:18:29.586 --> 00:18:32.569
he has found that that eluded
his predecessors?

00:18:32.569 --> 00:18:35.900
In many ways we have already
seen, I've already suggested.

00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:39.010
Rousseau follows in the
footsteps of his great

00:18:39.010 --> 00:18:42.190
predecessors,
particularly Hobbes and Locke,

00:18:42.190 --> 00:18:47.871
in attempting to understand the
original condition by referring

00:18:47.871 --> 00:18:52.819
to this hypothetical or
conjectural state of nature.

00:18:52.819 --> 00:18:55.930
In many ways,
he praises and follows Hobbes

00:18:55.930 --> 00:19:00.225
and Locke in doing this but
suggests that they never really

00:19:00.225 --> 00:19:03.779
took the problem of nature
seriously enough.

00:19:03.779 --> 00:19:06.752
What does it mean,
Rousseau seems to ask us,

00:19:06.752 --> 00:19:08.688
to take nature,
human nature,

00:19:08.688 --> 00:19:11.799
the state of nature,
what does it mean to take

00:19:11.799 --> 00:19:13.390
nature seriously?

00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:21.754
Again to understand it,
to understand human nature,

00:19:21.754 --> 00:19:25.288
what it originally is,
is to conduct a sort of thought

00:19:25.288 --> 00:19:29.089
experiment where we peel away
almost like the layers of an

00:19:29.089 --> 00:19:31.757
onion,
everything that we have

00:19:31.757 --> 00:19:35.980
acquired through the influence
of time, of history,

00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:40.778
of custom and tradition,
in order to discover what is

00:19:40.778 --> 00:19:44.769
naturally there.
So when Hobbes tells us or when

00:19:44.769 --> 00:19:49.053
he attributes to natural man
certain warlike propensities,

00:19:49.053 --> 00:19:52.509
Rousseau figures that this
cannot be right.

00:19:52.509 --> 00:19:57.125
War and the passions that give
rise to war can only come into

00:19:57.125 --> 00:20:01.538
being once we are in society.
The state of war is really

00:20:01.538 --> 00:20:06.306
simply the state of society.
This cannot be told for natural

00:20:06.306 --> 00:20:10.106
man because the natural
conditions had no social

00:20:10.106 --> 00:20:15.037
relationships of this sort and
you might say his statement was

00:20:15.037 --> 00:20:19.278
ditto for John Locke.
When Locke attributes to us in

00:20:19.278 --> 00:20:22.985
the state of nature certain
qualities of rationality,

00:20:22.985 --> 00:20:25.480
of industry,
of acquisitiveness.

00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:29.737
These too, Rousseau complains,
are only qualities that we can

00:20:29.737 --> 00:20:34.004
acquire in the light of society.
Property entails social

00:20:34.004 --> 00:20:38.037
relations between persons,
relations of justice and

00:20:38.037 --> 00:20:43.359
injustice, and man in a state of
nature is not a social animal.

00:20:43.359 --> 00:20:47.786
So it is clear for Rousseau
that human nature is something

00:20:47.786 --> 00:20:51.591
infinitely more remote and
strange than any of his

00:20:51.591 --> 00:20:56.507
predecessors had ever imagined.
What was the condition of

00:20:56.507 --> 00:21:00.346
natural man?
Rousseau's captivated readers,

00:21:00.346 --> 00:21:04.841
in his time and since,
by showing that the original

00:21:04.841 --> 00:21:09.965
condition of human nature was
far more like an animal than

00:21:09.965 --> 00:21:14.369
anything identifiably or
recognizably human.

00:21:14.369 --> 00:21:19.640
Rousseau takes great delight in
animalizing human nature,

00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:23.440
animalizing us.
When Aristotle said that man is

00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:27.629
the rational being because we
possess speech or logos

00:21:27.629 --> 00:21:31.827
Rousseau says "wrong again."
Language is dependent upon

00:21:31.827 --> 00:21:35.745
society and could only have
developed over literally

00:21:35.745 --> 00:21:40.278
thousands of generations and
cannot be a property of natural

00:21:40.278 --> 00:21:42.382
man.
Human nature is little

00:21:42.382 --> 00:21:45.336
different from animal nature
and, in many ways,

00:21:45.336 --> 00:21:49.060
Rousseau delights in…you can
see this in his footnotes in

00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:52.720
particular…in investigating
stories about orangutans and

00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:56.092
other species that he believes,
in many ways,

00:21:56.092 --> 00:21:59.018
are our distant ancestors.
You might say,

00:21:59.018 --> 00:22:02.899
a century before Darwin,
Rousseau could just have easily

00:22:02.899 --> 00:22:06.640
entitled his second discourse
On the Origins of the

00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:07.840
Species.

00:22:11.029 --> 00:22:13.115
In many ways,
the whole science of

00:22:13.115 --> 00:22:16.150
evolutionary biology is already,
in many ways,

00:22:16.150 --> 00:22:19.619
implicit here and yet for all
of our features,

00:22:19.619 --> 00:22:22.779
our common features with other
species,

00:22:22.779 --> 00:22:27.099
Rousseau specifies two
qualities that set us apart.

00:22:27.099 --> 00:22:31.699
The first is the quality of
freedom or what he calls free

00:22:31.699 --> 00:22:36.710
agency although he understands
this in a very specific way.

00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:39.740
Let me read a relevant or
crucial passage.

00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:43.943
"In any animal," Rousseau
writes, "in any animal I see

00:22:43.943 --> 00:22:49.019
nothing but an ingenious machine
to which nature has given senses

00:22:49.019 --> 00:22:53.620
in order for it to renew its
strength and to protect itself

00:22:53.620 --> 00:22:58.299
to a certain point from all that
tends to disturb it.

00:22:58.299 --> 00:23:02.095
I am aware of precisely the
same thing in the human

00:23:02.095 --> 00:23:04.237
machine."
In other words,

00:23:04.237 --> 00:23:09.641
he says animals are just simply
little machines that operate by

00:23:09.641 --> 00:23:14.871
mechanical or physical impulses
and needs and desires and the

00:23:14.871 --> 00:23:19.461
same is true,
he says, in the human machine

00:23:19.461 --> 00:23:24.046
with this difference,
"that nature alone does

00:23:24.046 --> 00:23:29.464
everything in the operations of
an animal whereas man

00:23:29.464 --> 00:23:35.299
contributes as a free agent to
his own operations."

00:23:35.299 --> 00:23:39.710
What does he mean there in
saying that man is a free agent?

00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:43.725
This idea of free agency in
many ways sounds similar,

00:23:43.725 --> 00:23:47.932
and indeed it is similar,
to Hobbes and Locke,

00:23:47.932 --> 00:23:54.406
both of whom who said freedom
of will, some kind of freedom is

00:23:54.406 --> 00:24:00.880
a characteristic of natural man
or natural pre social man.

00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:04.089
But Rousseau seems to add to
this something different.

00:24:04.089 --> 00:24:08.660
Freedom for Hobbes or Locke
simply means the freedom to

00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:13.378
choose to do this or that,
the freedom to exercise the

00:24:13.378 --> 00:24:18.250
will and not to be interfered
with by others around us.

00:24:18.250 --> 00:24:22.346
Rousseau also believes that but
in many ways he adds something

00:24:22.346 --> 00:24:24.657
else to it.
He connects freedom,

00:24:24.657 --> 00:24:28.394
in this same passage,
to what he calls the phenomenon

00:24:28.394 --> 00:24:31.627
or the quality,
the faculty of perfectibility,

00:24:31.627 --> 00:24:35.856
perfectibilité.
What does he mean in connecting

00:24:35.856 --> 00:24:38.930
freedom with what he calls
perfectibility?

00:24:38.930 --> 00:24:41.702
Perfectibility,
for Rousseau,

00:24:41.702 --> 00:24:46.652
suggests an openness,
a sort of virtually unlimited

00:24:46.652 --> 00:24:51.680
openness to change.
We are the species who not only

00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:57.091
have the freedom to do this or
that but we are the species who

00:24:57.091 --> 00:25:01.172
have the freedom,
as it were, to become this or

00:25:01.172 --> 00:25:04.593
that.
And it is our very openness to

00:25:04.593 --> 00:25:08.900
change that accounts for our
mutability over time.

00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:11.094
As a species,
in other words,

00:25:11.094 --> 00:25:14.464
we are you might say,
uniquely undetermined,

00:25:14.464 --> 00:25:19.167
meaning that our nature is not
confined in advance to what it

00:25:19.167 --> 00:25:22.205
may become;
rather, our nature,

00:25:22.205 --> 00:25:26.154
for Rousseau,
is uniquely suited to alter and

00:25:26.154 --> 00:25:30.553
transform itself as
circumstances change and as we

00:25:30.553 --> 00:25:35.400
adapt and adopt to new and
unforeseen situations.

00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:40.113
Perfectibility for Rousseau is
not so much a feature of the

00:25:40.113 --> 00:25:43.119
individual as it is of the
species.

00:25:43.119 --> 00:25:46.921
And again, whereas Hobbes or
Locke assumed that human nature

00:25:46.921 --> 00:25:50.723
itself remained more or less
constant in the transition from

00:25:50.723 --> 00:25:54.589
what they called the state of
nature to the civil state,

00:25:54.589 --> 00:25:59.257
Rousseau believed that human
nature has undergone manifold

00:25:59.257 --> 00:26:03.680
revolutions as he called it over
the source of time.

00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:08.755
What we are at any one phase of
human history or human evolution

00:26:08.755 --> 00:26:12.300
will be very,
very different from what we are

00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:17.335
at any other particular phase.
And it is this what he calls

00:26:17.335 --> 00:26:22.008
distinctive and unlimited
faculty that he says is also the

00:26:22.008 --> 00:26:24.960
source of all of our
misfortunes.

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:28.191
So when he says that we are
characterized by freedom and

00:26:28.191 --> 00:26:30.599
associates freedom with
perfectibility,

00:26:30.599 --> 00:26:36.155
he doesn't necessarily mean by
"perfectibility" that which

00:26:36.155 --> 00:26:39.846
perfects us.
He also says it is that which

00:26:39.846 --> 00:26:44.180
is at the source of our miseries
and our discontents.

00:26:44.180 --> 00:26:46.465
In many ways,
if you wanted to give this book

00:26:46.465 --> 00:26:48.907
another title I've already
suggested one for it,

00:26:48.907 --> 00:26:50.829
The Origin of the
Species.

00:26:50.829 --> 00:26:54.466
It could just as well have been
called more than a century

00:26:54.466 --> 00:26:56.763
before Freud,
Civilization and its

00:26:56.763 --> 00:26:59.872
Discontents,
which is many ways Freud's

00:26:59.872 --> 00:27:04.101
attempt to rewrite Rousseau's
account of the evolution of the

00:27:04.101 --> 00:27:06.880
human species.
But Rousseau notes,

00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:10.871
in this same part,
that freedom or perfectibility

00:27:10.871 --> 00:27:15.196
is not our sole natural
characteristic although it is

00:27:15.196 --> 00:27:17.329
responsible,
in some way,

00:27:17.329 --> 00:27:19.910
for almost everything that we
have become.

00:27:19.910 --> 00:27:23.080
Everything that we have become
is due to this openness to

00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:25.871
change.
In addition to perfectibility

00:27:25.871 --> 00:27:30.750
and freedom is the quality that
Rousseau calls pitié,

00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:33.446
or pity, compassion,
and here is,

00:27:33.446 --> 00:27:37.660
in a sense, Rousseau at his
most characteristic.

00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:39.628
You could say,
here is Rousseau,

00:27:39.628 --> 00:27:41.470
the founder of Romanticism.

00:27:45.099 --> 00:27:49.517
Man is not the rational animal,
the thinking being,

00:27:49.517 --> 00:27:54.111
the being with logos,
but we are the sensitive

00:27:54.111 --> 00:27:57.684
creature.
Rousseau finds all kinds of

00:27:57.684 --> 00:28:02.263
evidence for assuming that
compassion is part of our

00:28:02.263 --> 00:28:06.178
original nature.
He notes, in other species,

00:28:06.178 --> 00:28:10.921
a reluctance to witness the
pain or suffering of another of

00:28:10.921 --> 00:28:15.716
its own kind,
how an animal will not wish to

00:28:15.716 --> 00:28:20.829
walk near a dead member of its
own species.

00:28:20.829 --> 00:28:25.086
That seems to indicate to
Rousseau, even in the other

00:28:25.086 --> 00:28:29.670
species, a kind of natural core
of compassion or pity.

00:28:29.670 --> 00:28:34.390
The fact that we cry at the
misfortunes of others who have

00:28:34.390 --> 00:28:38.365
nothing to do with us is
evidence of our original

00:28:38.365 --> 00:28:42.591
sensitivity.
Do we not enjoy crying in

00:28:42.591 --> 00:28:46.462
movies?
Has someone in here ever cried

00:28:46.462 --> 00:28:49.789
in a movie?
Yeah, I thought we all have.

00:28:49.789 --> 00:28:53.940
Even at people or objects that
don't exist.

00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:59.990
Did we not feel pity for King
Kong when we saw that movie?

00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:04.105
Did we not feel pity for a
fictional creature that could

00:29:04.105 --> 00:29:08.819
not exist but yet whose fate
somehow affected us in some way?

00:29:08.819 --> 00:29:12.130
And Rousseau completely
understands this.

00:29:12.130 --> 00:29:15.484
In giving man tears,
Rousseau writes,

00:29:15.484 --> 00:29:21.075
nature bears witness that she
gave the human race the softest

00:29:21.075 --> 00:29:24.711
of hearts.
Man is a sensitive creature,

00:29:24.711 --> 00:29:29.541
so much so that Rousseau finds
evidence in this for what he

00:29:29.541 --> 00:29:32.539
believes is our natural
goodness.

00:29:32.539 --> 00:29:37.363
The natural goodness of man in
the state of nature is to some

00:29:37.363 --> 00:29:42.266
degree borne out by this quality
of pity or compassion that we

00:29:42.266 --> 00:29:47.291
even share with other species.
Why does Rousseau emphasize

00:29:47.291 --> 00:29:51.622
this quality?
Because it is deeply important

00:29:51.622 --> 00:29:55.967
to him.
You might say long before Dr.

00:29:55.967 --> 00:30:02.739
Phil and thousands of other
self-help gurus and self-help

00:30:02.739 --> 00:30:10.599
manuals, Rousseau taught us to
get in touch with our feelings.

00:30:10.599 --> 00:30:14.704
While natural man may be
compassionate and kind,

00:30:14.704 --> 00:30:18.109
however, that sentiment,
he tells us,

00:30:18.109 --> 00:30:22.997
is easily overpowered by more
powerful passions once we enter

00:30:22.997 --> 00:30:27.069
society, once we become
civilized or socialized.

00:30:27.069 --> 00:30:31.239
We cease, once we are in
society, to care about others

00:30:31.239 --> 00:30:35.880
and we become calculating and
mercenary in other motives.

00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:39.547
Selfishness and egoism are in
fact reinforced for him by the

00:30:39.547 --> 00:30:42.779
development of reason.
Reason, he writes,

00:30:42.779 --> 00:30:48.190
is what engenders egoism and
reflection strengthens it.

00:30:48.190 --> 00:30:52.585
The development of rationality,
he thinks, simply hastens our

00:30:52.585 --> 00:30:56.834
corruption by the assisting in
the development of different

00:30:56.834 --> 00:31:00.789
vices and the task of the
Second Discourse,

00:31:00.789 --> 00:31:05.106
at least its rhetorical task,
is in many ways to recover our

00:31:05.106 --> 00:31:07.565
natural selves,
compassionate,

00:31:07.565 --> 00:31:10.431
gentle, kind,
from the artificial,

00:31:10.431 --> 00:31:15.381
corrupt and calculating selves
we have all become in civil

00:31:15.381 --> 00:31:19.328
society.
And who can't read that in

00:31:19.328 --> 00:31:25.940
Rousseau without realizing that
there is a significant germ of

00:31:25.940 --> 00:31:30.251
truth in what he says?
Did Rousseau believe it

00:31:30.251 --> 00:31:34.500
possible then or desirable to
return to the state of nature,

00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:38.482
to return to some kind of
prelapsarian condition before

00:31:38.482 --> 00:31:43.352
the beginnings of civil society?
He is frequently read as saying

00:31:43.352 --> 00:31:45.753
this.
When Voltaire wrote--read,

00:31:45.753 --> 00:31:49.043
rather, the Second
Discourse, he said,

00:31:49.043 --> 00:31:53.678
"never has so much intelligence
been expended in the attempt to

00:31:53.678 --> 00:31:57.864
turn us back into brutes" and
that is clever but it's not

00:31:57.864 --> 00:32:02.513
really right.
Voltaire surely knew that 150

00:32:02.513 --> 00:32:07.951
years before Rousseau,
there was a French writer by

00:32:07.951 --> 00:32:12.210
the name of Montaigne,
Michel de Montaigne,

00:32:12.210 --> 00:32:16.832
who had written an important
essay called On Cannibals

00:32:16.832 --> 00:32:21.300
in which he described Indian
tribes off the coast of Brazil

00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:26.154
whom he praised against the true
savagery and barbarism of their

00:32:26.154 --> 00:32:29.661
European conquers.
When he calls that essay,

00:32:29.661 --> 00:32:32.696
that famous essay,
Michel called--Montaigne calls

00:32:32.696 --> 00:32:35.985
it Of Cannibals,
it is an open question of who

00:32:35.985 --> 00:32:39.518
the cannibals are.
Are they the natives of the

00:32:39.518 --> 00:32:44.059
Brazilian coast or are they
again the European conquerors?

00:32:44.059 --> 00:32:48.248
And Montaigne,
like Rousseau but a century or

00:32:48.248 --> 00:32:51.769
more before, praised,
in many ways,

00:32:51.769 --> 00:32:55.082
the qualities and the
capacities of these

00:32:55.082 --> 00:32:59.389
sauvage that he
discovered and contrasted them

00:32:59.389 --> 00:33:04.690
to the bloodthirsty cruelty of
the Europeans of his own day.

00:33:04.690 --> 00:33:08.303
Rousseau was deeply influenced
by this particular essay and

00:33:08.303 --> 00:33:12.041
it's a short essay and I would
suggest at some point when you

00:33:12.041 --> 00:33:15.004
have a chance you read it.
But in any case,

00:33:15.004 --> 00:33:19.244
Rousseau makes it plain that a
return to the state of nature or

00:33:19.244 --> 00:33:23.143
some kind of pre-social or
pre-civil state is no longer an

00:33:23.143 --> 00:33:26.637
option for civilized beings.
In one of the footnotes,

00:33:26.637 --> 00:33:29.474
and I encourage you to read the
footnote, very important

00:33:29.474 --> 00:33:31.434
footnotes in his book,
Rousseau writes,

00:33:31.434 --> 00:33:34.296
"What then?
Must we destroy societies,

00:33:34.296 --> 00:33:38.839
annihilate thine and mine and
return to live in the forests

00:33:38.839 --> 00:33:41.818
with the bears?
A conclusion," he writes,

00:33:41.818 --> 00:33:44.892
"in the style of my
adversaries, which I prefer to

00:33:44.892 --> 00:33:48.970
anticipate rather than to leave
to them the shame of drawing."

00:33:48.970 --> 00:33:50.842
And, he says,
in other words no,

00:33:50.842 --> 00:33:53.996
we can't do that.
A return to the state of nature

00:33:53.996 --> 00:33:57.622
is impossible for us for the
same reason it would be like

00:33:57.622 --> 00:34:00.730
returning a domestic animal back
to the wild.

00:34:00.730 --> 00:34:04.119
They and we have simply lost
our instinct for

00:34:04.119 --> 00:34:07.528
self-preservation.
It has been dulled by continual

00:34:07.528 --> 00:34:09.820
association and dependence on
others.

00:34:09.820 --> 00:34:14.918
We would not last a single day.
So if a return to nature is

00:34:14.918 --> 00:34:19.656
impossible, the only alternative
in some way is to remain in

00:34:19.656 --> 00:34:23.086
society.
But before we can learn how to

00:34:23.086 --> 00:34:26.651
live in society,
Rousseau wants to tell the

00:34:26.651 --> 00:34:31.320
story of how it is man became
civilized so to speak,

00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:35.762
how the transition from nature
to culture or from nature to

00:34:35.762 --> 00:34:37.830
society in fact occurred.

00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:51.269
In one sense,
Rousseau's account of this

00:34:51.269 --> 00:34:57.409
story can be given in a single
word: Property.

00:34:57.409 --> 00:35:02.260
The first sentence of Part II
of the Discourse reads as

00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:07.429
follows: "The first person who
having enclosed a piece of land,

00:35:07.429 --> 00:35:11.761
took it into his head to say
this is mine and found people

00:35:11.761 --> 00:35:16.092
simple enough to believe him was
the true founder of civil

00:35:16.092 --> 00:35:19.288
society."
Locke would certainly agree,

00:35:19.288 --> 00:35:22.602
in some respects,
but Rousseau continues as

00:35:22.602 --> 00:35:24.620
follows.
"What crimes,

00:35:24.620 --> 00:35:28.605
wars, murders,
what miseries and horrors would

00:35:28.605 --> 00:35:34.183
the human race have been spared
had someone pulled up the stakes

00:35:34.183 --> 00:35:39.495
or filled in the ditch and cried
out to his fellow men do not

00:35:39.495 --> 00:35:44.540
listen to this impostor.
You are lost if you forget that

00:35:44.540 --> 00:35:49.289
the fruits of the earth belong
to all and the earth to no one."

00:35:49.289 --> 00:35:52.464
There you see,
in a germ, in many ways,

00:35:52.464 --> 00:35:56.533
his repudiation of Locke.
Rousseau was not a communist

00:35:56.533 --> 00:36:00.680
although this sounds very much
in some respects like Karl Marx.

00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:04.226
He was not a communist.
He did not feel it was either

00:36:04.226 --> 00:36:08.988
again possible or desirable to
do away with private property or

00:36:08.988 --> 00:36:13.749
to collectivize property in the
manner of a Plato or a Marx but

00:36:13.749 --> 00:36:17.819
there is no one of whom I am
aware who is a more acute

00:36:17.819 --> 00:36:22.042
observer of the ills of class
and the effects of private

00:36:22.042 --> 00:36:26.207
property than Rousseau.
He believed that there was

00:36:26.207 --> 00:36:30.280
something deeply wrong with the
conception of government as the

00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:34.025
protector of private property
that intervenes as little as

00:36:34.025 --> 00:36:37.966
necessary with the affairs of
individuals leaving them simply

00:36:37.966 --> 00:36:41.794
free to pursue life,
liberty and estate as they

00:36:41.794 --> 00:36:44.450
would see fit.
Rousseau, in many ways,

00:36:44.450 --> 00:36:47.456
points back to an older,
you might say classical

00:36:47.456 --> 00:36:51.484
conception of government of the
ancient polis and ancient

00:36:51.484 --> 00:36:54.871
republic,
one for which politics had the

00:36:54.871 --> 00:36:59.438
task, among other things,
of supervising the pursuit and

00:36:59.438 --> 00:37:04.475
acquisition of property,
mitigating the harshest effects

00:37:04.475 --> 00:37:08.481
of economic inequalities.
And a single sentence from

00:37:08.481 --> 00:37:11.996
Rousseau's first discourse,
The Discourse on the Arts

00:37:11.996 --> 00:37:13.913
and Sciences,
in many ways,

00:37:13.913 --> 00:37:16.853
says it all.
"Ancient politicians," he

00:37:16.853 --> 00:37:20.190
wrote, "spoke only about morals
and virtues.

00:37:20.190 --> 00:37:25.619
Ours speak only of commerce and
money."

00:37:25.619 --> 00:37:30.659
That was Rousseau's complaint,
no talk any longer of civic

00:37:30.659 --> 00:37:32.870
virtue and citizenship.

00:37:36.809 --> 00:37:40.924
Locke's view,
recall from just a couple of

00:37:40.924 --> 00:37:45.740
days ago, is that the
emancipation of acquisition

00:37:45.740 --> 00:37:50.286
makes everyone better.
In Locke's famous formula,

00:37:50.286 --> 00:37:54.531
a day laborer in England is
housed, clothed and fed better

00:37:54.531 --> 00:37:58.625
than a king of the Americas.
And Rousseau believed that from

00:37:58.625 --> 00:38:01.907
a strictly, you might say,
economic point of view there is

00:38:01.907 --> 00:38:03.980
certainly a lot of truth to
this.

00:38:03.980 --> 00:38:08.317
But he also realized that from
the economic point of view or

00:38:08.317 --> 00:38:12.582
that the economic point of view
barely began to scratch the

00:38:12.582 --> 00:38:16.756
surface of things.
Rousseau is far more impressed,

00:38:16.756 --> 00:38:19.890
you might say,
by the proud dignity and

00:38:19.890 --> 00:38:24.591
independence of the native
American king than with all the

00:38:24.591 --> 00:38:29.374
luxuries and conveniences that
have made European kings and

00:38:29.374 --> 00:38:33.498
even some European day laborers
soft and dependent,

00:38:33.498 --> 00:38:37.004
in his word.
Rousseau was deeply impressed,

00:38:37.004 --> 00:38:40.317
and again you see this in his
footnotes, with the kind of

00:38:40.317 --> 00:38:42.980
inassimilable character of
native peoples,

00:38:42.980 --> 00:38:46.809
Icelanders, Greenlanders,
Hottentots, he writes,

00:38:46.809 --> 00:38:50.801
all of their refusal to
assimilate in many ways to

00:38:50.801 --> 00:38:55.119
European religion and custom.
They prefer their "personal

00:38:55.119 --> 00:38:58.380
independence," he writes,
"to the comforts and luxuries

00:38:58.380 --> 00:39:01.618
of modern civilization."
Consider the following passage,

00:39:01.618 --> 00:39:04.628
which is one of the passages I
love in this book that comes

00:39:04.628 --> 00:39:07.446
from his footnotes.
He says, "savages have often

00:39:07.446 --> 00:39:10.320
been brought to Paris,
London and other cities.

00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:13.292
People have been eager to
display our luxury,

00:39:13.292 --> 00:39:17.480
our wealth and all our most
useful and curious arts to them.

00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:21.712
None of this has ever excited
in them anything but a stupid

00:39:21.712 --> 00:39:25.800
admiration without the least
stirring of covetousness.

00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:28.670
I recall, among others,
the story of a chief of some

00:39:28.670 --> 00:39:32.216
North Americans who was brought
to the court of England about 30

00:39:32.216 --> 00:39:35.861
years ago," he writes.
"A thousand things were made to

00:39:35.861 --> 00:39:39.942
pass before his eyes in an
attempt to give him some present

00:39:39.942 --> 00:39:43.952
that could please him but
nothing was found about which he

00:39:43.952 --> 00:39:47.349
seemed to care.
Our weapons seemed heavy and

00:39:47.349 --> 00:39:49.830
cumbersome to him.
Our shoes hurt his feet.

00:39:49.830 --> 00:39:53.260
Our clothes restricted him.
He rejected everything.

00:39:53.260 --> 00:39:56.460
Finally, it was noticed that
having taken a wool blanket,

00:39:56.460 --> 00:39:59.659
he seemed to take some pleasure
in wrapping it around his

00:39:59.659 --> 00:40:02.085
shoulders.
‘You will agree at least,'

00:40:02.085 --> 00:40:05.569
someone immediately said to him,
‘on the usefulness of this

00:40:05.569 --> 00:40:07.741
furnishing.'
‘Yes,' he replies,

00:40:07.741 --> 00:40:11.320
‘this seems to be nearly as
good as an animal skin.'

00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:14.654
However," Rousseau says,
"he would not have said that

00:40:14.654 --> 00:40:17.219
had he worn both of them in the
rain."

00:40:17.219 --> 00:40:21.892
And there's kind of Rousseau's
sense of the virtue,

00:40:21.892 --> 00:40:25.145
again.
The proud independence,

00:40:25.145 --> 00:40:30.809
of the native of the
sauvage, as he calls him,

00:40:30.809 --> 00:40:34.404
to the decadence,
the corruptness,

00:40:34.404 --> 00:40:38.869
the softness of the modern
European.

00:40:38.869 --> 00:40:42.750
Rousseau's assertion that
market economies and the

00:40:42.750 --> 00:40:47.342
governments that protect them do
in a sense make all people

00:40:47.342 --> 00:40:52.014
better off and yet despite this
fact he realized that market

00:40:52.014 --> 00:40:56.449
economies also introduced vast
inequalities between human

00:40:56.449 --> 00:41:01.200
beings and this is a trade off
that Rousseau seemed unwilling

00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:06.030
to make or wished to make even
though I would have to say most

00:41:06.030 --> 00:41:10.940
Americans seem fairly happy with
this trade off perhaps because

00:41:10.940 --> 00:41:15.770
we have--we either are or have
become kind of natural Lockeans

00:41:15.770 --> 00:41:19.498
but that,
again, is a bargain or a

00:41:19.498 --> 00:41:23.650
tradeoff that Rousseau was at
least unwilling to accept.

00:41:23.650 --> 00:41:28.383
He was not only impressed with
what was gained by the progress

00:41:28.383 --> 00:41:32.030
of civilization but more
impressed, so to speak,

00:41:32.030 --> 00:41:36.043
by what was lost.
Its inequalities increase,

00:41:36.043 --> 00:41:39.985
we are forced to become greedy,
calculating,

00:41:39.985 --> 00:41:43.436
acquisitive,
again our natural pity or

00:41:43.436 --> 00:41:48.670
compassion is easily overcome by
these more powerful passions.

00:41:48.670 --> 00:41:54.179
What becomes of our original
goodness and natural decency?

00:41:54.179 --> 00:41:56.254
Natural man,
for Rousseau,

00:41:56.254 --> 00:42:01.400
thought of himself but only of
himself whereas civilized man is

00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:06.380
forced to think of others but we
do only in a calculating and

00:42:06.380 --> 00:42:09.826
mercenary way,
thinking of them as means to

00:42:09.826 --> 00:42:12.630
our own ends.
Even the social bond itself,

00:42:12.630 --> 00:42:16.247
even the social contract,
is simply an agreement among

00:42:16.247 --> 00:42:18.639
business partners,
so to speak,

00:42:18.639 --> 00:42:21.360
the most bourgeois of
institutions,

00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:24.995
the contract.
The fact is Rousseau believes

00:42:24.995 --> 00:42:29.544
under modern conditions natural
man is transformed into a

00:42:29.544 --> 00:42:33.501
bourgeois.
Rousseau is one of the first to

00:42:33.501 --> 00:42:38.365
use that term in quite that way.
Locke's rational and

00:42:38.365 --> 00:42:41.296
industrious man was,
for Rousseau,

00:42:41.296 --> 00:42:46.090
simply the calculating
bourgeois and unlike the natural

00:42:46.090 --> 00:42:48.673
man,
who thinks only of himself,

00:42:48.673 --> 00:42:51.646
or of the classical citizen of
Rome or Sparta,

00:42:51.646 --> 00:42:55.610
who thinks only of the common
good and his public duties,

00:42:55.610 --> 00:42:59.531
the bourgeois inhabits a kind
of halfway house,

00:42:59.531 --> 00:43:04.390
neither capable of original or
spontaneous goodness nor of

00:43:04.390 --> 00:43:07.800
political heroism or
self-sacrifice.

00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:12.534
In short, our modern people
have become kind of nullities,

00:43:12.534 --> 00:43:14.527
nowhere men,
nowhere man,

00:43:14.527 --> 00:43:18.016
you might say,
in the title of the Beatles'

00:43:18.016 --> 00:43:20.579
song.
How did that happen?

00:43:20.579 --> 00:43:25.800
How did we become put in this
situation?

00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:29.452
I have suggested one answer or
Rousseau suggests one answer,

00:43:29.452 --> 00:43:33.544
the development of property.
But that's only part of the

00:43:33.544 --> 00:43:38.593
story and what I want to do for
next week is tell another very

00:43:38.593 --> 00:43:41.216
important,
in some respects even more

00:43:41.216 --> 00:43:44.843
important, part of that story of
how we have become the way we

00:43:44.843 --> 00:43:47.460
are.
So anyway, have a good weekend.

00:43:47.460 --> 00:43:51.161
Go to the football game and
we're going to win against

00:43:51.161 --> 00:43:52.161
Princeton.

00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:05.031
Professor Shelly Kagan:
At the end of last class,

00:00:05.031 --> 00:00:07.973
we started sketching an
argument that comes from

00:00:07.973 --> 00:00:11.289
Descartes, the Cartesian
argument, that says merely by

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:14.669
the process of thinking,
on the basis of thought alone,

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:18.048
it tends to show that the
mind--We all agree that there

00:00:18.048 --> 00:00:21.607
are minds.
What the argument attempts to

00:00:21.607 --> 00:00:26.700
show is that this mind must be
something separate from my body.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.497
And what's amazing about the
argument is that it works on the

00:00:30.497 --> 00:00:32.840
basis of a pure thought
experiment.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.662
The thought experiment,
you recall, was one in which I

00:00:36.662 --> 00:00:40.990
imagine, I tell myself a story
in which what I'm doing is I'm

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:44.380
imagining my mind existing
without my body.

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:48.410
It doesn't seem especially
difficult to do that.

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.310
But then, we add this extra
philosophical premise.

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:55.455
If I can imagine one thing
without the other,

00:00:55.455 --> 00:00:59.600
then it must be that those are
two things.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:05.074
So my mind must not be my body.
My mind must not be the same

00:01:05.074 --> 00:01:08.629
thing as my body or a way of
talking about my body,

00:01:08.629 --> 00:01:14.073
because of course if my mind
just was--talking about my mind

00:01:14.073 --> 00:01:18.040
just was--a way of talking about
my body,

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.494
then to try to imagine my mind
without my body would be trying

00:01:21.494 --> 00:01:23.590
to imagine my body without my
body.

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.710
And that, obviously,
can't happen.

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:31.211
Look.
Suppose we try to imagine a

00:01:31.211 --> 00:01:38.040
world in which Shelly exists but
Kagan doesn't.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.307
You can't, right?
Because of course,

00:01:40.307 --> 00:01:42.879
they're just a single thing,
Shelly Kagan.

00:01:42.879 --> 00:01:45.829
And so if you've imagined
Shelly existing then of course

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:48.402
you're imagining that single
thing, Shelly Kagan,

00:01:48.402 --> 00:01:50.834
existing.
And if you imagine Kagan not

00:01:50.834 --> 00:01:53.871
existing, then you're imagining
that single thing,

00:01:53.871 --> 00:01:55.730
Shelly Kagan,
not existing.

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:59.568
So you can't even imagine a
world in which Shelly exists but

00:01:59.568 --> 00:02:02.094
Kagan doesn't.
Now, it's important not to be

00:02:02.094 --> 00:02:05.158
confused about this.
We can easily imagine a world

00:02:05.158 --> 00:02:09.340
in which I don't have the last
name Kagan or perhaps to switch

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.763
it around, Shelly's not my name.
Suppose my parents had named me

00:02:13.763 --> 00:02:15.370
Bruce.
Nothing would be easier.

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.709
Imagine a world in which Kagan
exists, but Shelly doesn't

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:21.870
exist, because nobody in the
world is named Shelly.

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.860
The question is not,
"Can you imagine me with a

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.735
different name?"
Bruce instead of Shelly,

00:02:27.735 --> 00:02:29.524
easy enough.
It's rather,

00:02:29.524 --> 00:02:33.559
"Can you imagine a world in
which the very thing that you

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:37.449
really are picking out when you
refer to me by the name

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:41.628
Shelly--namely this thing--can
you imagine a world in which

00:02:41.628 --> 00:02:44.800
that thing exists,
but the thing that you're

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.870
picking up when you use the word
Kagan does not exist?"

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.019
And that you can't do,
because in the real world of

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:52.770
course Shelly and Kagan pick out
just two different names of this

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.599
very same thing.
This thing right here.

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:58.612
So imagining a world in which
Shelly exists but Kagan doesn't

00:02:58.612 --> 00:03:00.469
or Kagan exists but Shelly
doesn't,

00:03:00.469 --> 00:03:03.326
that's trying to imagine a
world in which I exist but I

00:03:03.326 --> 00:03:05.548
don't.
And that's, of course,

00:03:05.548 --> 00:03:08.099
incoherent.
So if you can--On the other

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:10.576
hand, contrast.
Can I imagine a world in which

00:03:10.576 --> 00:03:13.050
my left hand exists,
but my right hand doesn't?

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.280
Easy.
Why is it so easy?

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.099
Because of course there's two
different things.

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:20.718
Of course, that doesn't mean
that in the real world one of

00:03:20.718 --> 00:03:22.740
them does exist and the other
one doesn't.

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:25.479
But it does show that in the
real world they are two

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:29.087
different things.
That's why I could imagine a

00:03:29.087 --> 00:03:32.229
world with one but not the
other.

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:40.614
Try to imagine a world in which
somebody's smile exists but

00:03:40.614 --> 00:03:45.410
their body doesn't.
You can't do it.

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:50.000
You can't have the smile
without the body.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.860
And of course,
no mystery about that.

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:56.477
That's because the smile isn't
really some separate thing from

00:03:56.477 --> 00:03:58.516
the body.
Talking about smiles,

00:03:58.516 --> 00:04:01.504
as we've noted before,
is just a way of talking about

00:04:01.504 --> 00:04:05.010
either what the body can do or
what a certain area of the body

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.400
can do.
You can try to imagine it.

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.556
In Alice in Wonderland,
the Cheshire Cat disappears and

00:04:11.556 --> 00:04:14.040
all we have left,
the last thing that disappears,

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.925
is the smile.
But of course,

00:04:15.925 --> 00:04:20.449
when you imagine the Cheshire
Cat only having the smile there,

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:24.421
you're still imagining the
cat's lips, teeth,

00:04:24.421 --> 00:04:27.220
maybe tongue,
whatever it is.

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.197
If you try to imagine a smile
with no body at all,

00:04:31.197 --> 00:04:33.740
it can't be done.
Why?

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.169
Because the smile isn't
something separate from the

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:40.269
body.
"Try to imagine my mind," says

00:04:40.269 --> 00:04:44.620
Descartes, "without my body."
Easy.

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:50.507
From which it follows that my
mind and my body must not be one

00:04:50.507 --> 00:04:53.280
thing.
They must, in fact,

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.096
be two things.
That's why it's possible to

00:04:56.096 --> 00:04:57.699
imagine the one without the
other.

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:03.010
So this Cartesian argument
seems to show us that the mind

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:07.286
is something separate from,
distinct from,

00:05:07.286 --> 00:05:11.867
not reducible to,
not just a way of talking

00:05:11.867 --> 00:05:15.472
about, my body.
So it's got to be something

00:05:15.472 --> 00:05:18.800
extra above and beyond my body.
It's a soul.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.953
That's what Descartes argued.
And as I say,

00:05:20.953 --> 00:05:23.935
to this day,
philosophers disagree about

00:05:23.935 --> 00:05:26.839
whether this argument works or
not.

00:05:26.839 --> 00:05:30.594
I don't think it does work and
in a second I'll give you a

00:05:30.594 --> 00:05:33.190
counter example.
And then, having given the

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:36.391
counter exampleâ€¦ That is to
say, what I'm going to give is

00:05:36.391 --> 00:05:38.670
an example of an argument just
like it,

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:41.247
or at least an argument that
seems to be just like it where

00:05:41.247 --> 00:05:43.870
we can pretty easily see that
that argument doesn't work.

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:48.456
And so something must go wrong
with Descartes' argument as

00:05:48.456 --> 00:05:51.652
well.
Well, here's the counter

00:05:51.652 --> 00:05:53.323
example.
Some of you,

00:05:53.323 --> 00:05:55.486
I'm sure most of you,
maybe all of you,

00:05:55.486 --> 00:05:57.649
are familiar with the Evening
Star.

00:05:57.649 --> 00:06:00.280
The Evening Star is the,
roughly speaking,

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:03.810
first heavenly body that's
visible in the sky as it gets

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:06.890
dark, at least at certain times
of the year.

00:06:11.089 --> 00:06:14.197
And I'm sure you're also
familiar then with the Morning

00:06:14.197 --> 00:06:16.251
Star.
The Morning Star is that

00:06:16.251 --> 00:06:20.174
heavenly body which is the last
heavenly body that's still

00:06:20.174 --> 00:06:23.959
visible as dawn comes in and it
begins to get light.

00:06:23.959 --> 00:06:28.061
So as a first pass,
the Evening Star is the first

00:06:28.061 --> 00:06:32.847
star that's visible and the
Morning Star is the last star

00:06:32.847 --> 00:06:37.120
that's visible at the right
times of the year.

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:40.997
The world that we live in has
both the Evening Star and the

00:06:40.997 --> 00:06:44.288
Morning Star.
But try to imagine a world in

00:06:44.288 --> 00:06:49.180
which the Evening Star exists,
but the Morning Star does not.

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:51.069
Seems fairly straightforward,
right?

00:06:51.069 --> 00:06:55.250
I get up in the morning as
dawn's approaching.

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:57.560
I look around and the Morning
Star is not there.

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:02.018
There is no star where the
Morning Star had been or where

00:07:02.018 --> 00:07:05.759
people have claimed it would be
or something.

00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:07.199
But the Evening Star still
exists.

00:07:07.199 --> 00:07:11.111
When I go out as sun sets and
dusk falls, there is the Evening

00:07:11.111 --> 00:07:12.196
Star.
So, as I say,

00:07:12.196 --> 00:07:14.743
it's a trivial matter to
imagine a world in which the

00:07:14.743 --> 00:07:17.339
Evening Star exists and the
Morning Star does not.

00:07:17.339 --> 00:07:20.972
And so we've got a--we could
imagine then a--Descartes-like

00:07:20.972 --> 00:07:23.740
argument saying,
"If I can imagine the Evening

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:27.191
Star without the Morning Star,
that shows the Evening Star and

00:07:27.191 --> 00:07:30.530
the Morning Star must be two
different heavenly bodies."

00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:35.488
But in fact, that's not so.
The Evening Star and the

00:07:35.488 --> 00:07:40.180
Morning Star are the very same
heavenly body.

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:42.910
In fact, it's not a star at all.
It's a planet.

00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:47.190
It's Venus, if I recall
correctly.

00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:52.710
So look, there's only one thing.
The Evening Star is Venus.

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:56.814
The Morning Star is Venus.
So there couldn't be a world in

00:07:56.814 --> 00:08:00.089
which the Evening Star exists,
but the Morning Star doesn't,

00:08:00.089 --> 00:08:04.424
because that would be a world
in which Venus exists and Venus

00:08:04.424 --> 00:08:07.800
doesn't exist.
Obviously, that's not possible.

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:12.360
Of course what you can imagine
is a world in which Venus isn't

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:15.872
visible in the morning.
Still, that's not a world in

00:08:15.872 --> 00:08:19.392
which the Morning Star doesn't
exist, given that what we mean

00:08:19.392 --> 00:08:22.149
by the Morning Star is that
heavenly object,

00:08:22.149 --> 00:08:25.814
whatever it is,
that in this world we pick out

00:08:25.814 --> 00:08:30.050
at that time in the morning
looking up at the sky.

00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:33.827
So when I refer to the Morning
Star, I'm talking about Venus,

00:08:33.827 --> 00:08:36.220
whether or not I realize it's
Venus.

00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:40.524
When I talk about the Evening
Star, I'm referring to Venus,

00:08:40.524 --> 00:08:44.830
whether or not I realize that
Venus is the Evening Star.

00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:48.602
So as long as Venus is around,
well, there's the Evening Star,

00:08:48.602 --> 00:08:51.200
there's the Morning Star,
there's Venus.

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:56.436
You can't have a world in which
the Morning Star doesn't exist

00:08:56.436 --> 00:08:59.960
but the Evening Star does.
Although you could have a world

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:01.660
in which Venus doesn't show up
in the morning.

00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:08.828
Still, from the fact that I can
imagine the world in which I

00:09:08.828 --> 00:09:11.740
look around for the Morning
Star--there it isn't.

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:13.610
I look around for the Evening
Star--there it is.

00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:16.570
You might have thought that
showed--didn't Descartes prove

00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:19.374
to us that that shows--the
Evening Star and the Morning

00:09:19.374 --> 00:09:23.340
Star are two different things?
Well no, obviously it didn't.

00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:24.570
So let's think about what that
means.

00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:29.250
So we've got this argument that
Descartes puts forward.

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:33.039
I can imagine my mind without
my body.

00:09:33.039 --> 00:09:35.199
And Descartes says that shows
that, in fact,

00:09:35.199 --> 00:09:37.460
my mind is something separate
from my body.

00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:47.033
Well, I can imagine the Evening
Star without the Morning Star,

00:09:47.033 --> 00:09:50.668
so Son of Descartes,
"Descarteson," has to say,

00:09:50.668 --> 00:09:54.389
"Oh, so that shows that the
Morning Star and the Evening

00:09:54.389 --> 00:09:58.856
Star are two different things."
But "Descarteson" would be

00:09:58.856 --> 00:10:01.889
wrong when he says that.
The Morning Star and the

00:10:01.889 --> 00:10:03.549
Evening Star aren't two
different things.

00:10:03.549 --> 00:10:08.120
They're just one thing,
namely Venus.

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:10.311
In fact, the sentence,
"They are one thing," is

00:10:10.311 --> 00:10:11.510
slightly misleading,
right?

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:16.490
It's just one thing, Venus.
If that argument,

00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:21.799
if the argument--If trying to
run the Cartesian argument for

00:10:21.799 --> 00:10:25.797
astronomy fails,
yet it seems to be an exactly

00:10:25.797 --> 00:10:29.584
analogous argument,
we ought to conclude that the

00:10:29.584 --> 00:10:34.554
argument for the distinctness of
the mind and the body must fail

00:10:34.554 --> 00:10:37.215
as well.
Now, that seems to me to be

00:10:37.215 --> 00:10:39.652
right.
I think the Cartesian argument

00:10:39.652 --> 00:10:42.161
does fail.
And I think the example of the

00:10:42.161 --> 00:10:45.290
Evening Star and the Morning
Star--which is not at all

00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:47.830
original to me--that this
example shows,

00:10:47.830 --> 00:10:50.970
this counter example shows,
that Descartes' original

00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:54.397
argument doesn't work either.
At least, that's how it seems

00:10:54.397 --> 00:10:57.012
to me, though as I say,
there are philosophers that

00:10:57.012 --> 00:10:58.529
say, "No, no.
That's not right.

00:10:58.529 --> 00:11:01.855
Maybe somehow we misunderstood
how the argument goes and it

00:11:01.855 --> 00:11:05.410
doesn't exactly--although these
two arguments seem parallel,

00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:09.733
they're not, in fact, parallel.
There's some subtle differences

00:11:09.733 --> 00:11:12.840
that if we're not looking
carefully, we'll overlook."

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:16.809
But, as I say,
the debate goes on.

00:11:16.809 --> 00:11:22.694
One of the reasons for thinking
it's not clear whether the

00:11:22.694 --> 00:11:28.269
argument fails or not is because
it's hard to pin down,

00:11:28.269 --> 00:11:34.849
where exactly did it go wrong?
Look, take the argument of the

00:11:34.849 --> 00:11:40.580
planets, the Morning Star and
the Evening Star example.

00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:43.642
I take it that we all agree
that when we attempt to run the

00:11:43.642 --> 00:11:46.916
Cartesian argument in terms of
the Morning Star and the Evening

00:11:46.916 --> 00:11:50.322
Star, it fails.
But it's harder to say what

00:11:50.322 --> 00:11:52.770
went wrong?
How did it go wrong?

00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:55.610
Why did it go wrong?
What are the possibilities?

00:11:55.610 --> 00:11:57.149
Well, we said,
look, first claim,

00:11:57.149 --> 00:12:00.200
first premise.
I can imagine a world in which

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:04.379
the Evening Star exists,
but the Morning Star doesn't.

00:12:04.379 --> 00:12:06.780
Well, I suppose one possible
response would be,

00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:08.919
"You know, you couldn't really
do that.

00:12:08.919 --> 00:12:12.698
You thought you were imagining
a world in which the Evening

00:12:12.698 --> 00:12:15.500
Star exists and the Morning Star
doesn't,

00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:18.680
but you weren't really
imagining a world in which the

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:21.799
Evening Star exists and the
Morning Star doesn't.

00:12:21.799 --> 00:12:27.519
You misdescribed what it is
you've imagined."

00:12:27.519 --> 00:12:31.919
That's not a silly thing to say
about the astronomy case.

00:12:31.919 --> 00:12:34.549
Maybe that's the right
diagnosis.

00:12:34.549 --> 00:12:38.397
Could we similarly say,
"I didn't really imagine a

00:12:38.397 --> 00:12:42.559
world in which my mind exists
but my body doesn't"?

00:12:42.559 --> 00:12:46.034
That little story I told last
time, I thought I was describing

00:12:46.034 --> 00:12:49.110
a world in which my mind exists
and my body doesn't,

00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:52.850
but it wasn't really imagining
a world like that.

00:12:52.850 --> 00:12:56.409
That doesn't seem so persuasive
over there.

00:12:56.409 --> 00:13:01.419
It did seem as though I was
imagining it.

00:13:01.419 --> 00:13:04.990
What else could go wrong with
the astronomy example?

00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:09.162
Well, maybe I did imagine a
world in which the Morning Star

00:13:09.162 --> 00:13:12.111
exists and the Evening Star
doesn't exist,

00:13:12.111 --> 00:13:15.779
but maybe imagining doesn't
mean it's possible.

00:13:15.779 --> 00:13:17.664
Normally, we think,
if we imagine something,

00:13:17.664 --> 00:13:19.405
it means it's possible.
Here I don't mean,

00:13:19.405 --> 00:13:20.590
of course, empirically
possible.

00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:22.740
I could imagine a world with
unicorns.

00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:24.491
It doesn't mean I think
unicorns are physically

00:13:24.491 --> 00:13:26.969
possible.
All we mean here is logically

00:13:26.969 --> 00:13:28.886
possible.
I can imagine a world with

00:13:28.886 --> 00:13:30.927
unicorns.
It seems to follow that

00:13:30.927 --> 00:13:35.762
unicorns are logically possible.
Imagination seems to be a guide

00:13:35.762 --> 00:13:39.720
to possibility;
but maybe not always.

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:44.056
Maybe sometimes we can imagine
something that's really

00:13:44.056 --> 00:13:48.508
impossible.
Try to imagine--can you do that

00:13:48.508 --> 00:13:54.630
or can you not do that?--try to
imagine a round square.

00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:56.289
Can you imagine it?
Can you not imagine it?

00:13:56.289 --> 00:13:59.027
In certain moods,
I sort of feel I can just begin

00:13:59.027 --> 00:14:01.188
to imagine it.
Of course, it doesn't really

00:14:01.188 --> 00:14:03.320
mean it's possible.
It seems like it's impossible.

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:07.110
So maybe imagination is a
flawed guide to possibility.

00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:10.190
So maybe that's what we should
say about the mind-body case.

00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:15.583
"Yeah, I can imagine a world in
which my mind exists but my body

00:14:15.583 --> 00:14:18.398
doesn't.
But that doesn't show that it's

00:14:18.398 --> 00:14:21.178
really possible,
logically possible to have a

00:14:21.178 --> 00:14:24.590
world in which my mind exists
and my body doesn't."

00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:27.600
Maybe that's where the argument
goes wrong.

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:31.249
On the other hand,
isn't imagination our best

00:14:31.249 --> 00:14:34.987
guide to logical possibility?
Isn't the reason I think

00:14:34.987 --> 00:14:38.053
unicorns are logically coherent
is because I can imagine them so

00:14:38.053 --> 00:14:38.540
easily?

00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:44.374
Another possibility.
Maybe we should say,

00:14:44.374 --> 00:14:48.084
the mere fact that it's
possible for A and B to be

00:14:48.084 --> 00:14:51.870
separate--for A to exist without
B for example,

00:14:51.870 --> 00:14:54.846
that's clearly where they're
separate--the mere fact that

00:14:54.846 --> 00:14:57.876
it's possible for them to be
separate doesn't mean that in

00:14:57.876 --> 00:14:59.950
the actual world they are
separate.

00:14:59.950 --> 00:15:05.578
Maybe the argument goes wrong
by assuming that identity--when

00:15:05.578 --> 00:15:09.237
A is equal to B,
it's always equal to B,

00:15:09.237 --> 00:15:12.331
no matter what.
Maybe identity,

00:15:12.331 --> 00:15:17.750
as philosophers like to put it,
maybe identity is contingent.

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:23.274
Maybe A could be the same thing
as B in this logically possible

00:15:23.274 --> 00:15:28.531
world, but we could imagine a
completely different logically

00:15:28.531 --> 00:15:33.700
coherent world in which A was
not the same thing as B.

00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:36.653
If that's right,
then maybe the conclusion

00:15:36.653 --> 00:15:38.886
should be "well,
you know, yeah,

00:15:38.886 --> 00:15:42.344
the Cartesian thought
experiment shows that there

00:15:42.344 --> 00:15:46.883
could be a world in which there
are minds that are not identical

00:15:46.883 --> 00:15:49.834
to bodies.
But that doesn't mean that in

00:15:49.834 --> 00:15:52.629
this world the mind is not
identical to my body.

00:15:52.629 --> 00:15:56.297
Maybe in this world,
minds and bodies are identical,

00:15:56.297 --> 00:16:00.469
even though in other logically
possible worlds the identity

00:16:00.469 --> 00:16:04.227
comes apart.
Identity is not necessary,

00:16:04.227 --> 00:16:08.740
but contingent,
as the philosophers put it."

00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:10.629
It's not clear that that's
right either.

00:16:10.629 --> 00:16:13.500
The notion of contingent
identity is very puzzling.

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:17.300
After all, if A really is B,
how could they come apart?

00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:19.830
There's only one thing there.
There's nothing to come apart.

00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:22.340
There's just A equals B,
that single thing.

00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:26.758
What's to come apart?
So where exactly does the

00:16:26.758 --> 00:16:29.948
argument break down?
Is it that I'm not really

00:16:29.948 --> 00:16:32.000
imagining?
I'm just thinking I'm imagining?

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.523
Is it that imagination's not
really a good guide to

00:16:34.523 --> 00:16:36.568
possibility?
I just--Often it is,

00:16:36.568 --> 00:16:39.244
but not always.
Is it that identity is

00:16:39.244 --> 00:16:42.650
contingent?
The interesting thing about

00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:48.460
Descartes' argument is that it's
easy to see something has gone

00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:54.269
wrong in the case of the Morning
Star and the Evening Star,

00:16:54.269 --> 00:16:59.750
but it's difficult to pin down
what exactly went wrong.

00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:02.948
Different philosophers agree
that something's gone wrong in

00:17:02.948 --> 00:17:05.430
the Morning Star and the Evening
Star case,

00:17:05.430 --> 00:17:11.563
but disagree about the best
diagnosis of where the mistake

00:17:11.563 --> 00:17:14.578
went in.
Armed with your pet diagnosis

00:17:14.578 --> 00:17:18.387
of where the argument goes wrong
there, you've got to ask,

00:17:18.387 --> 00:17:21.930
"Does it also go wrong in the
mind and body case?"

00:17:21.930 --> 00:17:26.049
Well, we could spend more time,
but I'm not going to.

00:17:26.049 --> 00:17:29.480
I think Descartes' argument
fails.

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:34.511
I think the Morning Star,
Evening Star case shows us that

00:17:34.511 --> 00:17:37.925
arguments like this,
at the very least,

00:17:37.925 --> 00:17:42.223
can't be taken at face value.
Just because it looks as though

00:17:42.223 --> 00:17:44.676
we can imagine it and just
because it seems as though from

00:17:44.676 --> 00:17:47.000
the fact that we can imagine one
without the other,

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.645
it just won't necessarily
follow that we really do have

00:17:51.645 --> 00:17:57.410
two things that are separate and
not identical in the real world.

00:17:57.410 --> 00:18:00.266
I'd be happy to discuss with
you, outside class,

00:18:00.266 --> 00:18:03.487
at greater length my favorite
theories as to where the

00:18:03.487 --> 00:18:06.586
argument goes wrong and why I
think it goes wrong in

00:18:06.586 --> 00:18:11.034
Descartes' case as well.
But I suggest that the argument

00:18:11.034 --> 00:18:14.960
goes wrong.
It's not right.

00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:19.646
And so, Descartes' attempt to
establish the distinctness of

00:18:19.646 --> 00:18:23.039
the mind, the immateriality of
the mind,

00:18:23.039 --> 00:18:26.296
on the basis of this Cartesian
thought experiment,

00:18:26.296 --> 00:18:29.467
I think that's unsuccessful.
Well, we've spent--Let's step

00:18:29.467 --> 00:18:30.930
back and think of where we've
been.

00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:34.553
We've spent the last week and a
half or so, maybe a bit more,

00:18:34.553 --> 00:18:37.814
two weeks, talking about
arguments for the existence of

00:18:37.814 --> 00:18:40.730
the soul.
And unsurprisingly--since I

00:18:40.730 --> 00:18:45.544
announced this was going to be
the result before the class had

00:18:45.544 --> 00:18:50.120
barely gotten started--I don't
think any of these arguments

00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:52.992
work.
I believe the attempts to

00:18:52.992 --> 00:18:57.740
establish the existence of a
soul, an immaterial object,

00:18:57.740 --> 00:19:01.858
the house of consciousness
separate and distinct from the

00:19:01.858 --> 00:19:04.579
body, I think those arguments
fail.

00:19:04.579 --> 00:19:09.068
But I recognize that this is
something that reasonable people

00:19:09.068 --> 00:19:11.730
can disagree about.
And so this is,

00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:15.583
as will be many times the case
over the course of this

00:19:15.583 --> 00:19:19.291
semester, something that I
invite you to continue to

00:19:19.291 --> 00:19:23.692
reflect on for yourself.
If you believe in a soul,

00:19:23.692 --> 00:19:28.617
what's the argument for it?
Well, what we're about to turn

00:19:28.617 --> 00:19:33.254
to is Plato's discussion of
these issues in the dialogue the

00:19:33.254 --> 00:19:37.853
Phaedo,
which, as I told you last week,

00:19:37.853 --> 00:19:44.064
purports to lay out the final
day's discussion with Socrates

00:19:44.064 --> 00:19:50.802
before he is killed by--he kills
himself--by drinking the hemlock

00:19:50.802 --> 00:19:56.381
in accordance with the
punishment that's been given to

00:19:56.381 --> 00:19:59.913
him.
Now, in the course of this

00:19:59.913 --> 00:20:05.026
discussion, Socrates and his
disciples argue about not so

00:20:05.026 --> 00:20:10.426
much the existence of the soul,
but the question really is the

00:20:10.426 --> 00:20:14.516
immortality of the soul.
After all, even if you believe

00:20:14.516 --> 00:20:18.941
in a soul, as I have remarked
previously, that doesn't give us

00:20:18.941 --> 00:20:23.148
yet any reason to believe the
soul continues to exist after

00:20:23.148 --> 00:20:27.661
the death of your body.
The kind of dualist position

00:20:27.661 --> 00:20:32.713
that we are considering in this
class is an interactionist

00:20:32.713 --> 00:20:36.789
position, where the soul
commands the body.

00:20:36.789 --> 00:20:39.430
That's what makes my fingers
move right now.

00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:43.319
And the body can affect the
soul.

00:20:43.319 --> 00:20:48.680
If I poke my body,
I feel it in my mind.

00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:51.022
So the mind,
the soul, and the body are

00:20:51.022 --> 00:20:53.180
obviously very tightly
connected.

00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:57.586
And so it could be--even if the
soul is something separate from

00:20:57.586 --> 00:21:01.779
the body--that when the body
dies, the soul dies as well.

00:21:01.779 --> 00:21:07.016
That's the question that's
driving the discussion in the

00:21:07.016 --> 00:21:10.666
Phaedo.
Do we have any good reason to

00:21:10.666 --> 00:21:14.259
believe the soul survives the
death of the body?

00:21:14.259 --> 00:21:19.408
And more particularly still,
do we have good reason to

00:21:19.408 --> 00:21:24.071
believe it's immortal?
Socrates believes in the

00:21:24.071 --> 00:21:28.347
immortality of the soul.
And so, he attempts to defend

00:21:28.347 --> 00:21:31.215
this position,
justify it to his disciples who

00:21:31.215 --> 00:21:33.700
are worried that it may not be
true.

00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:36.717
It's important to realize--as
you read the dialogue,

00:21:36.717 --> 00:21:39.439
it becomes fairly
apparent--that there isn't so

00:21:39.439 --> 00:21:42.220
much any defense of the belief
in the soul.

00:21:42.220 --> 00:21:44.799
There's some of it,
but it's not the primary goal.

00:21:44.799 --> 00:21:49.611
For the most part,
the existence of the soul is

00:21:49.611 --> 00:21:53.900
just taken for granted in the
dialogue.

00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:58.006
Plato, as a dualist,
portrays Socrates as being a

00:21:58.006 --> 00:22:01.769
dualist and that's just taken
for granted.

00:22:01.769 --> 00:22:04.985
The question that the
philosophical discussion turns

00:22:04.985 --> 00:22:08.861
on is not, "Is there a soul?"
but rather, "Does it survive

00:22:08.861 --> 00:22:12.970
the death of the body?
Is it immortal?"

00:22:12.970 --> 00:22:18.003
Now, as I said,
this is Socrates' last day on

00:22:18.003 --> 00:22:23.610
earth and you'd expect him to be
pretty bummed.

00:22:23.610 --> 00:22:28.221
You'd expect him to be sad.
And one of the just striking

00:22:28.221 --> 00:22:33.008
things is that Socrates is in a
very happy, indeed jovial,

00:22:33.008 --> 00:22:36.690
mood, joking with his friends.
Why is that?

00:22:36.690 --> 00:22:38.766
Well, of course,
it's because he thinks,

00:22:38.766 --> 00:22:40.842
first of all,
there's a soul and it will

00:22:40.842 --> 00:22:43.697
survive and it's immortal.
But more importantly

00:22:43.697 --> 00:22:47.594
still--those are all crucial but
there's an extra ingredient as

00:22:47.594 --> 00:22:50.799
well--he thinks he's got good
reason to believe,

00:22:50.799 --> 00:22:54.903
when he dies he's going to go,
basically, to what we'd call

00:22:54.903 --> 00:22:57.427
heaven.
He thinks there's a realm

00:22:57.427 --> 00:23:01.880
populated by good gods and maybe
other philosophical kindred

00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:04.873
souls.
And if you got your stuff

00:23:04.873 --> 00:23:09.592
together here on life,
you'll get to go to that when

00:23:09.592 --> 00:23:13.380
you die.
And so he's excited.

00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:14.690
He's pleased.

00:23:18.079 --> 00:23:22.109
Why does he think he's going to
go?

00:23:22.109 --> 00:23:25.405
Well, in thinking about
Socrates' belief in the

00:23:25.405 --> 00:23:29.130
existence of a soul,
it's important to understand,

00:23:29.130 --> 00:23:32.813
it's important to notice,
that his take on which stuff

00:23:32.813 --> 00:23:36.038
gets assigned to the body,
what are the bodily things

00:23:36.038 --> 00:23:39.038
versus what are the soul-like
things, is rather different from

00:23:39.038 --> 00:23:40.694
the way,
I think, most of us nowadays

00:23:40.694 --> 00:23:41.530
would draw the line.

00:23:45.059 --> 00:23:47.561
When I talked about arguments
for the existence of a soul,

00:23:47.561 --> 00:23:49.580
I said, "Look,
here's one possible argument.

00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:52.594
I see colors.
No physical object could,

00:23:52.594 --> 00:23:55.490
no purely physical object could
see colors.

00:23:55.490 --> 00:23:59.869
I can taste tastes and have the
smell of coffee and so forth."

00:23:59.869 --> 00:24:04.849
But Socrates thinks all those
bodily sensations--that's all

00:24:04.849 --> 00:24:07.940
stuff that the body takes care
of.

00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:12.039
So unlike those modern dualists
who think we need to appeal to

00:24:12.039 --> 00:24:16.140
something immaterial in order to
explain bodily sensations,

00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:19.468
Socrates thinks no,
no, the body takes care of all

00:24:19.468 --> 00:24:22.662
the bodily sensations,
all the desirings and the

00:24:22.662 --> 00:24:27.010
wantings and the emotions and
the feelings and the cravings.

00:24:27.010 --> 00:24:34.769
That's all body stuff.
What the soul does--Socrates

00:24:34.769 --> 00:24:40.599
thinks--the soul thinks.
The soul, in its essence,

00:24:40.599 --> 00:24:44.723
is rational.
It takes care of the thinking

00:24:44.723 --> 00:24:46.210
side of things.

00:24:51.290 --> 00:24:57.283
What does the soul think about?
Well, the soul thinks about all

00:24:57.283 --> 00:24:59.210
sorts of things,
doubtless.

00:24:59.210 --> 00:25:02.879
But one of the things that it
can do, one of the things that

00:25:02.879 --> 00:25:05.180
sort of provides the
underpinnings,

00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:08.699
as we'll see,
for Plato's arguments for the

00:25:08.699 --> 00:25:13.809
immortality of the soul is the
soul can think about--;well,

00:25:13.809 --> 00:25:17.559
here I'll have to introduce a
word of philosophical jargon.

00:25:17.559 --> 00:25:20.866
Sometimes the idea,
sometimes the term is called

00:25:20.866 --> 00:25:24.627
"ideas."
Sometimes the term is called

00:25:24.627 --> 00:25:29.047
"forms."
But the thought is that the

00:25:29.047 --> 00:25:36.048
soul can think about certain
pure concepts or ideas like

00:25:36.048 --> 00:25:41.078
justice itself,
or beauty itself,

00:25:41.078 --> 00:25:47.200
or goodness itself,
or health itself.

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:53.435
So to explain all this we need
now a sort of crash course in

00:25:53.435 --> 00:25:57.253
Plato's metaphysics.
Obviously, this will be rather

00:25:57.253 --> 00:25:59.491
superficial.
Those of you who would like to

00:25:59.491 --> 00:26:01.771
know more about it,
I recommend reading more

00:26:01.771 --> 00:26:05.060
Platonic dialogues or taking a
class in ancient philosophy.

00:26:05.060 --> 00:26:10.642
But here's the basic idea.
There's all sorts of beautiful

00:26:10.642 --> 00:26:15.667
objects in the world.
Objects can vary in terms of

00:26:15.667 --> 00:26:20.490
how beautiful they are.
But Plato's got the idea that

00:26:20.490 --> 00:26:25.269
there's nothing in this world
that's perfectly beautiful.

00:26:25.269 --> 00:26:30.363
And yet for all that,
we can think about beauty

00:26:30.363 --> 00:26:33.150
itself.
Well, we might put it this way.

00:26:33.150 --> 00:26:36.085
We might say,
ordinary, humdrum,

00:26:36.085 --> 00:26:41.010
everyday, physical objects are
somewhat beautiful.

00:26:41.010 --> 00:26:44.388
They're partially beautiful.
As, sometimes,

00:26:44.388 --> 00:26:48.970
Platonists put it,
they "participate" in beauty.

00:26:48.970 --> 00:26:53.059
They partake of beauty to
varying degrees.

00:26:53.059 --> 00:26:58.440
But none of them should be
confused with beauty itself.

00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:03.796
Or, take justice.
There are various arrangements,

00:27:03.796 --> 00:27:06.666
social arrangements,
that can be just or unjust to

00:27:06.666 --> 00:27:09.410
varying degrees.
But we don't think anywhere in

00:27:09.410 --> 00:27:12.289
the world there's any society
that's perfectly just.

00:27:12.289 --> 00:27:15.820
Yet for all that,
the mind can think about

00:27:15.820 --> 00:27:19.248
perfect justice.
And notice how ordinary

00:27:19.248 --> 00:27:24.230
empirical social arrangements
fall short of perfect justice.

00:27:24.230 --> 00:27:29.812
So whatever perfect justice is,
it's not one more thing in the

00:27:29.812 --> 00:27:32.960
empirical world.
It's something we can think

00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:35.311
about.
It's something that things in

00:27:35.311 --> 00:27:38.964
the empirical world can
participate in or partake of to

00:27:38.964 --> 00:27:42.249
varying degrees.
But we shouldn't confuse the

00:27:42.249 --> 00:27:46.177
physical things which can be
just, the people who can be

00:27:46.177 --> 00:27:48.819
virtuous to one degree or
another,

00:27:48.819 --> 00:27:51.769
with perfect virtue or perfect
justice.

00:27:51.769 --> 00:27:55.273
That's something that only the
mind can think about,

00:27:55.273 --> 00:27:59.394
that we don't actually have in
the world, the empirical world

00:27:59.394 --> 00:28:03.309
itself.
Or take being round.

00:28:03.309 --> 00:28:08.839
The mind can think about
perfect circularity.

00:28:08.839 --> 00:28:13.589
But no physical object is
perfectly circular.

00:28:13.589 --> 00:28:17.171
There are only things that are
circular to a greater or lesser

00:28:17.171 --> 00:28:20.128
degree.
So, by thinking about it,

00:28:20.128 --> 00:28:25.859
by thinking about these kinds
of issues, we can see that the

00:28:25.859 --> 00:28:30.620
mind has some kind of handle on
these perfect,

00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:31.997
well, we need a word.
And as I say,

00:28:31.997 --> 00:28:33.910
Plato gives us a word,
"ideas."

00:28:33.910 --> 00:28:36.769
Sometimes it's translated as
"ideas" or "forms."

00:28:36.769 --> 00:28:42.065
These things that we can think
about that are the template,

00:28:42.065 --> 00:28:46.540
or at least the standard,
or maybe at the very least it's

00:28:46.540 --> 00:28:50.365
that which the ordinary humdrum
things can participate in to

00:28:50.365 --> 00:28:52.700
varying degrees:
perfect justice,

00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:54.995
justice itself,
beauty itself,

00:28:54.995 --> 00:28:57.765
goodness itself,
circularity itself,

00:28:57.765 --> 00:29:01.956
health itself.
All of these things are,

00:29:01.956 --> 00:29:07.950
as philosophers nowadays call
them, Platonic forms.

00:29:07.950 --> 00:29:12.997
Ordinary material objects of
this world can partake of the

00:29:12.997 --> 00:29:17.780
various Platonic forms,
but they should not be confused

00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:22.383
with the Platonic forms.
But we still--even though we

00:29:22.383 --> 00:29:26.553
don't bump into the Platonic
forms in this world--we can

00:29:26.553 --> 00:29:31.681
think about them.
Our mind has a kind of grasp of

00:29:31.681 --> 00:29:35.006
them.
Of course, the problem is,

00:29:35.006 --> 00:29:41.168
we're distracted by the comings
and goings, the hurly burly of

00:29:41.168 --> 00:29:46.995
the ordinary everyday world.
And so we don't have a very

00:29:46.995 --> 00:29:50.390
good grasp of the Platonic
forms.

00:29:50.390 --> 00:29:56.490
We're able to think about them,
but we're distracted.

00:29:56.490 --> 00:30:01.333
What the philosopher tries to
do--this is Socrates' thought,

00:30:01.333 --> 00:30:06.176
or Plato's thought that he puts
in Socrates' mouth--what the

00:30:06.176 --> 00:30:11.101
philosopher tries to do is free
himself from the distractions

00:30:11.101 --> 00:30:14.960
that the body poses--the desire
for food,

00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:18.640
the craving for sex,
being concerned about pain.

00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:22.938
All this stuff,
hungering after pleasure,

00:30:22.938 --> 00:30:29.385
all this stuff gets in the way
of thinking about the Platonic

00:30:29.385 --> 00:30:32.893
forms.
What the philosopher tries to

00:30:32.893 --> 00:30:37.509
do, then, so as to better focus
on these ideal things,

00:30:37.509 --> 00:30:42.662
is to disregard the body,
put it aside,

00:30:42.662 --> 00:30:49.170
separate his mind as much as
possible from it.

00:30:49.170 --> 00:30:54.440
That's what Socrates says he's
been trying to do.

00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:59.204
And so because of that,
he's got a better handle on

00:30:59.204 --> 00:31:03.046
these ideal forms.
And then, he believes,

00:31:03.046 --> 00:31:08.241
when death comes and the final
separation occurs of the mind

00:31:08.241 --> 00:31:11.365
and the body,
his mind gets to go up,

00:31:11.365 --> 00:31:14.869
his soul gets to go up to this
heavenly realm.

00:31:14.869 --> 00:31:17.759
Philosophers nowadays call it
"Plato's heaven."

00:31:17.759 --> 00:31:21.135
He gets to go up to Plato's
heaven where he can have more

00:31:21.135 --> 00:31:24.210
direct contact with these
things, with the forms.

00:31:28.049 --> 00:31:34.313
Now, I don't have the time here
to say enough to try and make it

00:31:34.313 --> 00:31:39.782
clear why this Platonic
metaphysical view is a view that

00:31:39.782 --> 00:31:43.660
not only is worth taking
seriously,

00:31:43.660 --> 00:31:46.606
but to this day,
many, many philosophers think

00:31:46.606 --> 00:31:49.160
that, at least in it's basic
strokes,

00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:53.857
must be right.
But let me at least give you

00:31:53.857 --> 00:31:57.310
one example that may give you a
feel for it.

00:31:57.310 --> 00:32:02.429
Think of math.
Think of some simple

00:32:02.429 --> 00:32:05.839
mathematical claim like 2 + 2 =
4.

00:32:05.839 --> 00:32:11.078
When we say that 2 + 2 = 4 or 2
+ 3 = 5, we're saying something

00:32:11.078 --> 00:32:15.050
about numbers that our mind is
able to grasp.

00:32:15.050 --> 00:32:22.250
But what are numbers anyway?
They're certainly not physical

00:32:22.250 --> 00:32:24.320
objects.
It's not as though someday

00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:27.605
you're going to open up an issue
of National Geographic

00:32:27.605 --> 00:32:30.460
where the cover story's going to
be "At long last,

00:32:30.460 --> 00:32:34.380
explorers have discovered the
number two."

00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:40.441
It's not as though the number
two is something that you see or

00:32:40.441 --> 00:32:43.920
hear or taste or could bump
into.

00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:50.397
Whatever the number two is,
it's something that our mind

00:32:50.397 --> 00:32:56.640
can grasp but isn't actually in
the physical world.

00:32:56.640 --> 00:33:01.380
That's the Platonic take on
mathematics.

00:33:01.380 --> 00:33:05.210
There are numbers.
The mind can think about them.

00:33:05.210 --> 00:33:10.998
Things can partake of them.
If I were to hold up two pieces

00:33:10.998 --> 00:33:15.621
of paper, there's a sense in
which they are participating in

00:33:15.621 --> 00:33:17.771
"twohood."
But of course,

00:33:17.771 --> 00:33:20.440
this is not the number two
here.

00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:23.891
If I were to rip these pieces
of paper, I wouldn't be

00:33:23.891 --> 00:33:27.045
destroying the number two.
So the number two,

00:33:27.045 --> 00:33:29.493
the numbers,
three, whatever it is,

00:33:29.493 --> 00:33:32.732
whatever they are,
are these Platonic abstract

00:33:32.732 --> 00:33:36.259
entities that don't exist in
space and time.

00:33:36.259 --> 00:33:40.690
Yet, for all that,
the mind can think about them.

00:33:40.690 --> 00:33:43.700
That's the idea.
And it's not a silly idea.

00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:49.659
It seems like a very compelling
account of what's going on in

00:33:49.659 --> 00:33:53.637
mathematics.
What mathematicians are doing

00:33:53.637 --> 00:33:58.721
is using their mind to think
about these Platonic ideas of

00:33:58.721 --> 00:34:02.453
mathematics.
Except Plato's thought was,

00:34:02.453 --> 00:34:06.000
everything is like that.
It's not just math,

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.309
but justice itself is like
that.

00:34:08.309 --> 00:34:10.739
There are just or unjust things
in the world.

00:34:10.739 --> 00:34:14.405
The mind can think about them,
but justice itself--this

00:34:14.405 --> 00:34:18.411
perfect, this idea of being
perfectly just--that's something

00:34:18.411 --> 00:34:21.800
the mind can think about,
but it's not here in the world.

00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:26.460
It's another abstract Platonic
form.

00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:31.511
So that's the picture.
Plato's idea is that if we

00:34:31.511 --> 00:34:38.436
start doing enough metaphysics,
we can see there must be this

00:34:38.436 --> 00:34:43.400
realm of Platonic ideas,
Platonic forms.

00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:50.400
And we can see that we are able
to grasp them through the mind.

00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:54.098
This can't be a job the body
does, because the body's only

00:34:54.098 --> 00:34:56.369
got its bodily capacities,
right?

00:34:56.369 --> 00:34:59.030
It's able to do the five-senses
thing.

00:34:59.030 --> 00:35:04.260
It's the soul that thinks about
the Platonic forms.

00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:08.749
And as Plato's then going to go
on to try to argue,

00:35:08.749 --> 00:35:12.789
given this picture of what the
mind can do,

00:35:12.789 --> 00:35:16.583
he thinks he can persuade us
that the mind,

00:35:16.583 --> 00:35:21.370
the soul, not only survives the
death of your body,

00:35:21.370 --> 00:35:25.840
but will last forever.
It's perfect.

00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:30.400
It's immaterial and can't be
destroyed.

00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:33.690
It's immortal.
So he offers a series of

00:35:33.690 --> 00:35:37.070
arguments for that conclusion,
for that position,

00:35:37.070 --> 00:35:40.521
and starting next time,
we'll work our way through

00:35:40.521 --> 00:35:41.654
those arguments.

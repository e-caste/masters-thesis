00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:06.350
Prof: So for those of
you who weren't here yesterday--

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:07.845
or, last class,
first class,

00:00:07.845 --> 00:00:10.450
I'll say a couple words about
what happened,

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:12.700
basically four words.
 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.820
The course is really made of up
four different elements.

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.970
The first part is the standard
financial theory course that

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.550
grew up in the last ten years at
a lot of major universities,

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.801
pioneered by a bunch of guys
who won Nobel Prizes in business

00:00:29.801 --> 00:00:30.510
schools.
 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.562
And it's the method,
some of them quite clever and I

00:00:33.562 --> 00:00:36.974
think fun, methods for pricing
financial assets and making

00:00:36.974 --> 00:00:38.890
optimal financial decisions.
 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.363
So you're going to learn all
these tricks and how the

00:00:42.363 --> 00:00:45.208
financial system works,
and you'll learn it both from a

00:00:45.208 --> 00:00:47.993
theoretical point of view,
the way they thought of it in

00:00:47.993 --> 00:00:51.693
these finance schools,
and also from a practical point

00:00:51.693 --> 00:00:56.069
of view since many of these very
same problems come up all the

00:00:56.069 --> 00:00:59.010
time in the hedge fund I helped
start.

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.100
So that'll be the main part of
the course, but there are three

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.090
other things that I want to
concentrate on in the course.

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:07.819
So the second point is
reexamining the logic of

00:01:07.819 --> 00:01:09.659
laissez-faire and regulation.
 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.772
This is a dramatic moment in
our history now where there's

00:01:13.772 --> 00:01:17.548
tremendous pressure on--
temporarily anyway--on the

00:01:17.548 --> 00:01:21.489
government to establish all
sorts of new regulations.

00:01:21.489 --> 00:01:23.754
There's also tremendous
resistance to establishing the

00:01:23.754 --> 00:01:24.909
new sorts of regulations.
 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:28.528
So there's a debate going on
now in Congress and in the halls

00:01:28.528 --> 00:01:32.025
of academia about what kind of
regulations should we put in

00:01:32.025 --> 00:01:34.185
place,
what regulations would have

00:01:34.185 --> 00:01:36.790
prevented the crisis we've just
lived through.

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.373
The crisis, by the way,
which I don't think we're done

00:01:39.373 --> 00:01:39.910
with yet.
 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:42.160
So there's a very powerful
argument in economics.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.099
The most famous argument in
economics,

00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:48.138
the invisible hand argument
that basically says markets work

00:01:48.138 --> 00:01:52.450
best when they're not encumbered
by government interventions.

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.334
So we're going to reexamine
that argument in the context of

00:01:55.334 --> 00:01:56.330
financial markets.
 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.596
Then the third thing I'm going
to discuss in this course at

00:01:59.596 --> 00:02:02.920
some length is the mortgage
market and the recent crisis.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.239
After all, my hedge fund is a
mortgage hedge fund.

00:02:06.239 --> 00:02:12.110
We founded it in 1994,
by the way, which was--

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.169
the five years before that I
was running the Fixed Income

00:02:15.169 --> 00:02:17.408
Research Department at Kidder
Peabody,

00:02:17.408 --> 00:02:20.241
which was the biggest player in
the mortgage market then on the

00:02:20.241 --> 00:02:20.788
sell side.
 

00:02:20.788 --> 00:02:24.163
The hedge funds buy mortgages,
investment banks create and

00:02:24.163 --> 00:02:26.000
sell the mortgage securities.
 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.294
So I was running the research
department at the firm that did

00:02:30.294 --> 00:02:34.160
twenty percent of the market in
what's called CMOs,

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.272
and then I changed to the buy
side and was at a hedge fund

00:02:38.272 --> 00:02:42.470
that bought those kinds of CMOs,
and bought sub-prime mortgage,

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:43.750
CDOs,
everything.

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.875
So it seems I suffered greatly
through the last two years of

00:02:47.875 --> 00:02:52.210
the mortgage crisis and it would
just be foolish not to explain

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:56.264
what was going on and what it
felt like to be in a mortgage

00:02:56.264 --> 00:03:01.158
hedge fund while the rest of the
world was collapsing around us.

00:03:01.158 --> 00:03:03.925
And for quite a while it's
given me some great

00:03:03.925 --> 00:03:06.628
embarrassment to have been part
of it all.

00:03:06.628 --> 00:03:09.730
On the other hand,
now I feel like one of those

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:10.538
survivors.
 

00:03:10.538 --> 00:03:16.258
Hundreds of our counter-parties
and much bigger mortgage players

00:03:16.258 --> 00:03:19.710
went out of business and we
didn't,

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:22.370
so I don't feel quite as bad
about it as I did before.

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.836
And I don't know every detail
of what went on in my hedge

00:03:24.836 --> 00:03:26.492
fund,
because after all I'm only part

00:03:26.492 --> 00:03:28.848
time there,
but there's a lot I do know

00:03:28.848 --> 00:03:32.128
about and so I'll try and tell
you some of that.

00:03:32.128 --> 00:03:35.110
And then the fourth thing is
Social Security.

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:40.443
This is the biggest government
program and it's a financial

00:03:40.443 --> 00:03:44.030
problem what to do about
retirement,

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.960
and Social Security is the
biggest government program of

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:47.280
all.
 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.485
The only thing close is the
military budget in terms of

00:03:51.485 --> 00:03:53.199
annual expenditures.
 

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:56.050
And so I'm going to explain how
that works, and what the problem

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:58.312
is, and how it arose,
and what I think the solution

00:03:58.312 --> 00:03:58.628
is.
 

00:03:58.628 --> 00:04:00.674
So those are the four things
the course is going to

00:04:00.674 --> 00:04:01.370
concentrate on.
 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:03.378
The mechanics of the course,
again,

00:04:03.378 --> 00:04:06.633
are homeworks,
every week there's going to be

00:04:06.633 --> 00:04:11.219
a homework with little problems
illustrating what we're talking

00:04:11.219 --> 00:04:11.960
about.
 

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.662
So there's one already on the
web, Tuesday,

00:04:13.662 --> 00:04:15.770
today, every Tuesday there will
be one on the web.

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:17.540
It'll be due the next Tuesday.
 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:21.613
The sections will always meet
between Thursday and Monday,

00:04:21.613 --> 00:04:24.399
so the problem set will come
Tuesday.

00:04:24.399 --> 00:04:27.348
You'll have two days of classes
on the material that the problem

00:04:27.348 --> 00:04:30.064
set will cover and then you can
talk to the TAs about stuff

00:04:30.064 --> 00:04:32.687
between Thursday and Tuesday
when I presume you'll do the

00:04:32.687 --> 00:04:33.529
problem set.
 

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:35.170
And that's twenty percent of
the grade.

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:36.660
Twenty percent is the first
midterm.

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.321
Twenty percent is the second
midterm and forty percent is the

00:04:40.321 --> 00:04:40.810
final.
 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:44.180
Two midterms takes a lot of
class time, on the other hand,

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.790
and it also takes a tremendous
amount of effort by the TAs.

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:51.130
And so I appreciate their
willingness to grade two

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:53.428
midterms,
but I think you'll find it's

00:04:53.428 --> 00:04:56.543
helpful to study the course in
two pieces than try to do the

00:04:56.543 --> 00:05:00.985
whole thing--
It'll be much better for you I

00:05:00.985 --> 00:05:05.779
found in the past to have two
midterms.

00:05:05.779 --> 00:05:07.149
Oh, and one warning.
 

00:05:07.149 --> 00:05:09.800
The course doesn't require
difficult mathematics,

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.740
but for me, as I said in the
first class,

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:17.238
it's very interesting that
there are so many subtle things

00:05:17.238 --> 00:05:20.079
that affect a financial
decision,

00:05:20.079 --> 00:05:22.238
and you have to think about
what you know and all the

00:05:22.238 --> 00:05:23.399
different things you know.
 

00:05:23.399 --> 00:05:25.516
You have to think about what
the other guy knows who's taking

00:05:25.516 --> 00:05:26.610
the other side of the market.
 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:29.959
You have to think about what he
knows about what you know,

00:05:29.959 --> 00:05:31.887
and you have to think about
what he knows about what you

00:05:31.887 --> 00:05:34.175
know about what he knows,
and all that thing in the end

00:05:34.175 --> 00:05:36.269
boils down to one number,
the price.

00:05:36.269 --> 00:05:40.331
So it's a philosophically
interesting problem,

00:05:40.331 --> 00:05:42.769
interactive epistemology.
 

00:05:42.769 --> 00:05:45.461
Some people have described
economics as interactive

00:05:45.461 --> 00:05:46.269
epistemology.
 

00:05:46.269 --> 00:05:48.923
It's more complicated than
standard epistemology and

00:05:48.923 --> 00:05:52.148
philosophy because there they go
in circles thinking about what

00:05:52.148 --> 00:05:55.476
one person knows and whether you
can know that you know and stuff

00:05:55.476 --> 00:05:56.310
like that.
 

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:58.110
In economics you have to worry
about what you know,

00:05:58.110 --> 00:05:59.983
what the other guy knows,
what you know about what he

00:05:59.983 --> 00:06:01.389
knows about what you know
etcetera.

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:04.464
So it's a more complex problem,
and yet at the end there's just

00:06:04.464 --> 00:06:06.500
one number which can be right or
wrong.

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:10.516
And so when I was a freshman
here at Yale my roommate who was

00:06:10.516 --> 00:06:14.399
a classics major said that his
subject was much harder than

00:06:14.399 --> 00:06:16.927
mine--
that was math--because all I

00:06:16.927 --> 00:06:18.519
had to do was be right.
 

00:06:18.519 --> 00:06:21.937
And so I'm going to take
advantage of that simplicity and

00:06:21.937 --> 00:06:25.720
every problem is going to have a
number that you're supposed to

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:26.269
find.
 

00:06:26.269 --> 00:06:30.526
And so it's not complicated
mathematics, but it involves

00:06:30.526 --> 00:06:31.920
lots of numbers.
 

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:34.410
And so if you hate numbers you
shouldn't take this course.

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:37.043
And as I said before,
there have always been people

00:06:37.043 --> 00:06:39.100
who, you know,
you can be very smart.

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:43.625
You can also have a great
future in finance and not like

00:06:43.625 --> 00:06:44.449
numbers.
 

00:06:44.449 --> 00:06:47.293
You can like making deals and
things like that not thinking in

00:06:47.293 --> 00:06:48.180
terms of numbers.
 

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:50.894
So just because you don't like
numbers and maybe shouldn't take

00:06:50.894 --> 00:06:53.303
this course doesn't mean you
should be discouraged about

00:06:53.303 --> 00:06:53.829
finance.
 

00:06:53.829 --> 00:06:56.536
It's just how I happen to teach
the course because that's what's

00:06:56.536 --> 00:06:57.440
comfortable for me.
 

00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:58.850
So I'm just warning you about
it.

00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:05.088
It won't be hard,
but it'll be relentless.

00:07:05.088 --> 00:07:07.749
I want to talk today about that
second problem,

00:07:07.749 --> 00:07:11.101
about the logic of the free
market and to do that I'm going

00:07:11.101 --> 00:07:13.009
to have to introduce a model.
 

00:07:13.009 --> 00:07:15.639
So it raises the question of
what is a model in economics.

00:07:15.639 --> 00:07:17.709
Many of you have taken
economics before.

00:07:17.709 --> 00:07:20.637
You sort of know what this idea
is, but I think it's worth

00:07:20.637 --> 00:07:23.773
spending a minute on it because
it represented a revolution in

00:07:23.773 --> 00:07:24.389
thought.
 

00:07:24.389 --> 00:07:28.110
So for an economist a model
means you distinguish exogenous

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:30.550
variables from endogenous
variables.

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:32.949
The exogenous things people
can't control.

00:07:32.949 --> 00:07:34.879
They're just the weather and
things like that.

00:07:34.879 --> 00:07:37.889
The endogenous variables are
things they can control and

00:07:37.889 --> 00:07:41.009
you're trying to predict what
the endogenous variables are

00:07:41.009 --> 00:07:43.992
going to turn out to be like,
what will the prices be,

00:07:43.992 --> 00:07:46.389
what will the consumptions be,
things like that.

00:07:46.389 --> 00:07:47.589
How much income will people
have?

00:07:47.589 --> 00:07:49.379
Those are the endogenous
variables.

00:07:49.379 --> 00:07:51.009
So you have a theory.
 

00:07:51.009 --> 00:07:54.889
So the theory is couched in
terms of equilibrium.

00:07:54.889 --> 00:07:59.077
There's a bunch of equations
which have to be satisfied,

00:07:59.077 --> 00:08:00.220
F of E and X.
 

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:02.862
So given the endogenous
variables and the exogenous

00:08:02.862 --> 00:08:04.632
variables,
exogenous and endogenous,

00:08:04.632 --> 00:08:07.346
I wrote them in that order,
there's a set of simultaneous

00:08:07.346 --> 00:08:10.028
equations,
F, that have to be satisfied.

00:08:10.028 --> 00:08:13.396
And so you find equilibrium
when given the exogenous

00:08:13.396 --> 00:08:17.091
variables E you find the
endogenous variables X of E that

00:08:17.091 --> 00:08:20.259
solve that system of
simultaneous equations.

00:08:20.259 --> 00:08:23.339
All our equilibrium models are
going to have that form,

00:08:23.339 --> 00:08:27.639
and one very important thing
they allow you to do,

00:08:27.639 --> 00:08:30.730
which is the heart of economic
analysis is comparative statics.

00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:36.130
If you change the exogenous
variable E it'll require a

00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:39.798
different X to solve the
equation.

00:08:39.798 --> 00:08:45.110
So E has an effect on X in
order to restore equilibrium.

00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:49.030
And so the prediction that a
change in E has a certain effect

00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:51.450
on X is called comparative
statics.

00:08:51.450 --> 00:08:53.600
Now, how would a historian
describe that?

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:55.187
A historian would say,
"Well, that's

00:08:55.187 --> 00:08:56.259
counterfactual reasoning.
 

00:08:56.259 --> 00:08:57.600
The environment is E.
 

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:00.106
Why are you bothering to tell
me about what would happen if

00:09:00.106 --> 00:09:02.269
the environment changed from E
to E-prime?"

00:09:02.269 --> 00:09:04.649
Well, that's the heart of
economic analysis.

00:09:04.649 --> 00:09:07.528
So in history you hardly ever
get much.

00:09:07.528 --> 00:09:10.950
People talk about it a little
just to raise the question.

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:13.909
How would the Vietnam War have
gone if Kennedy hadn't been

00:09:13.909 --> 00:09:14.690
assassinated?
 

00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:18.100
So they all bring that up,
but you get two sentences.

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:19.749
"Oh, he was really going
to pull out,"

00:09:19.749 --> 00:09:21.013
or "Oh,
he had been sending more

00:09:21.013 --> 00:09:21.470
advisors.
 

00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:23.330
It would have gone the same
way."

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:24.528
That's about it.
 

00:09:24.528 --> 00:09:27.798
In economics the heart of the
thing is to go off on a tangent

00:09:27.798 --> 00:09:31.124
and figure out what would have
happened if the environment had

00:09:31.124 --> 00:09:32.159
been different.
 

00:09:32.159 --> 00:09:34.350
So why do a model?
 

00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:38.664
Well, because many different
settings can be described by the

00:09:38.664 --> 00:09:39.600
same model.
 

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:40.919
So it just saves time.
 

00:09:40.919 --> 00:09:45.399
It makes things much simpler.
 

00:09:45.399 --> 00:09:48.206
From the counterfactual
reasoning you're making

00:09:48.206 --> 00:09:49.059
predictions.
 

00:09:49.059 --> 00:09:51.100
It helps your understanding.
 

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:53.812
And then for the purposes of
the next few lectures the most

00:09:53.812 --> 00:09:56.620
important thing is there's some
properties of equilibrium.

00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:58.883
Like, for example,
equilibrium is so good you

00:09:58.883 --> 00:10:01.918
wouldn't want to interfere with
equilibrium because it makes

00:10:01.918 --> 00:10:04.748
everyone so well off and it
would be a terrible thing to

00:10:04.748 --> 00:10:05.519
regulate.
 

00:10:05.519 --> 00:10:08.452
So those properties of
equilibrium are what we have to

00:10:08.452 --> 00:10:09.558
test the logic of.
 

00:10:09.558 --> 00:10:14.129
So there's an obvious critique
you can make of modeling.

00:10:14.129 --> 00:10:17.243
The first person to make a
model was Ricardo,

00:10:17.243 --> 00:10:21.418
who you I'm sure have heard of,
the principle of comparative

00:10:21.418 --> 00:10:22.408
advantage.
 

00:10:22.408 --> 00:10:25.000
He was the first guy who didn't
write verbally.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.067
He said, "Okay,
I'm talking about international

00:10:27.067 --> 00:10:28.769
trade and why free trade is a
good idea.

00:10:28.769 --> 00:10:30.269
I could make a verbal argument.
 

00:10:30.269 --> 00:10:32.635
That's what everyone else has
done, but I'm not going to do

00:10:32.635 --> 00:10:32.840
it.
 

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:36.293
I'm going to say,
'Suppose that England produced

00:10:36.293 --> 00:10:40.629
with one hour of labor three
bottles of wine' and so on,

00:10:40.629 --> 00:10:43.120
" and he had a little
numerical example.

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:46.240
And he solved it and he showed
that in that numerical example

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:49.412
it's better to have free trade
as paradoxical as it might have

00:10:49.412 --> 00:10:50.658
sounded at the time.
 

00:10:50.658 --> 00:10:53.844
The Portuguese had such lower
labor costs why shouldn't

00:10:53.844 --> 00:10:57.264
English workers be afraid of
being thrown out of their jobs

00:10:57.264 --> 00:11:00.686
when trading with Portugal where
the labor was so much less

00:11:00.686 --> 00:11:01.629
expensive.
 

00:11:01.629 --> 00:11:04.061
Well he explained why that
turned out not to be the case,

00:11:04.061 --> 00:11:05.190
but in terms of a model.
 

00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:07.259
So Malthus, who you've also
heard of,

00:11:07.259 --> 00:11:11.149
a contemporary of his and his
rival but also his friend,

00:11:11.149 --> 00:11:14.638
said, "This model stuff is
ridiculous because if you start

00:11:14.638 --> 00:11:18.068
making a model the point of a
model is to make deductions from

00:11:18.068 --> 00:11:19.398
it,
and to analyze it,

00:11:19.398 --> 00:11:21.514
and analyze it deeper,
and deeper, and deeper,

00:11:21.514 --> 00:11:23.856
and of course the model to
begin with is going to be wrong

00:11:23.856 --> 00:11:26.363
and as you go deeper and deeper
into the analysis of the model

00:11:26.363 --> 00:11:28.623
the error that you made at the
beginning is going to get

00:11:28.623 --> 00:11:29.610
compounded."
 

00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:31.840
Like he said,
"The tailors of Laputa,

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:34.960
who by a slight mistake at the
outset"--

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:37.720
doing their stitches,
go wrong--the stitch goes

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:40.647
further and further wrong--
you "arrive at conclusions

00:11:40.647 --> 00:11:42.178
the most distance from the
truth."

00:11:42.178 --> 00:11:44.379
Anyway, that's what you might
think is wrong with models,

00:11:44.379 --> 00:11:48.100
and the very first model was
critiqued by that reasoning,

00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:50.628
but it's turned out
historically that modeling is

00:11:50.628 --> 00:11:53.524
the way to make progress in
economics and everybody does

00:11:53.524 --> 00:11:54.418
modeling now.
 

00:11:54.418 --> 00:11:56.897
You'll find out as I talk more
about it that the Cowles

00:11:56.897 --> 00:11:59.212
Foundation,
which has been at Yale since

00:11:59.212 --> 00:12:02.023
1955, was founded by a Cowles
[correction: Yale]

00:12:02.023 --> 00:12:03.038
undergraduate.
 

00:12:03.038 --> 00:12:04.139
You'll hear the whole history
of it.

00:12:04.139 --> 00:12:06.009
I was the director of it for
nine years.

00:12:06.009 --> 00:12:08.905
That was the one most important
institution in the world

00:12:08.905 --> 00:12:11.538
promoting the uses of
mathematics in economics,

00:12:11.538 --> 00:12:15.154
and the revolution succeeded
and now all economists use

00:12:15.154 --> 00:12:16.830
models and mathematics.
 

00:12:16.830 --> 00:12:19.820
Anyway, let's take an example
of the simplest model.

00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:24.995
There are so many different
ways of organizing price and

00:12:24.995 --> 00:12:25.750
trade.
 

00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:28.278
At a supermarket the seller
just sets the price and you

00:12:28.278 --> 00:12:29.168
decide to buy it.
 

00:12:29.168 --> 00:12:31.605
If you go to Jerusalem or
something in the old city you

00:12:31.605 --> 00:12:33.590
know that you're haggling over
everything.

00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:36.830
You offer this and the guy says
no and you walk away,

00:12:36.830 --> 00:12:39.379
and you come back and it takes
a half a day to argue the price,

00:12:39.379 --> 00:12:42.000
but that's another way of
arguing the price.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.178
Then there's--the government
could set the price.

00:12:44.178 --> 00:12:49.197
In the Paris Bourse the way it
worked is there would be a

00:12:49.197 --> 00:12:53.678
temporary price set and then
supply and demand--

00:12:53.678 --> 00:12:55.360
people would announce how much
they wanted to buy,

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:57.658
and if the supply didn't equal
demand the price would get

00:12:57.658 --> 00:12:58.070
changed.
 

00:12:58.070 --> 00:13:00.009
So it was--tâtonnement
means groping,

00:13:00.009 --> 00:13:01.038
or groping to the price.
 

00:13:01.038 --> 00:13:03.538
There's the commodities futures
just like the experiment we ran

00:13:03.538 --> 00:13:04.908
where people yell at each other.
 

00:13:04.908 --> 00:13:09.730
There's computer bid/ask prices
where you do everything online.

00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:12.418
There's the specialist in the
stock exchange.

00:13:12.418 --> 00:13:15.494
There's one guy everybody has
to come to, and so he's

00:13:15.494 --> 00:13:17.798
responsible for clearing the
markets.

00:13:17.798 --> 00:13:21.226
So I might, in fact,
mention a little bit of the

00:13:21.226 --> 00:13:23.558
history of this sort of thing.
 

00:13:23.558 --> 00:13:25.019
I don't know if I can hit
escape.

00:13:25.019 --> 00:13:30.528
It might be somewhat
interesting.

00:13:30.528 --> 00:13:35.783
So the first people who had
these well-developed markets and

00:13:35.783 --> 00:13:38.009
money were the Lydians.
 

00:13:38.009 --> 00:13:40.700
They invented money in 640 B.C.
 

00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:43.546
and they had gold coins,
and with all this money and

00:13:43.546 --> 00:13:46.951
trading they got very quickly to
gambling and prostitution for

00:13:46.951 --> 00:13:47.509
money.
 

00:13:47.509 --> 00:13:53.539
And Midas, the Midas touch was
everything turned to gold was

00:13:53.539 --> 00:13:54.460
Lydian.
 

00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:58.711
They've discovered all these
mints where their capital was so

00:13:58.711 --> 00:14:02.822
they know that they were making
all this money and gold and

00:14:02.822 --> 00:14:04.240
stuff like that.
 

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:05.649
So they had open-air markets.
 

00:14:05.649 --> 00:14:07.759
They invented the retail
markets.

00:14:07.759 --> 00:14:10.695
Croesus was one of the most
famous Lydian kings,

00:14:10.695 --> 00:14:14.379
and he's the guy--rich as
Croesus is a famous expression.

00:14:14.379 --> 00:14:17.796
He's the one who went to the
Delphic oracle and asked if he

00:14:17.796 --> 00:14:21.791
should fight the great Persian,
Cyrus the Great and the Delphic

00:14:21.791 --> 00:14:25.389
oracle as usual mysteriously
said a great kingdom will be

00:14:25.389 --> 00:14:27.827
destroyed,
and since it was Cyrus the

00:14:27.827 --> 00:14:31.139
Great he figured it must be
Cyrus' and it was his kingdom

00:14:31.139 --> 00:14:32.440
that was destroyed.
 

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:33.990
So the Greeks copied a lot of
that stuff.

00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:37.474
They had their agora which was
the open market and they had

00:14:37.474 --> 00:14:40.118
lots of trade,
and they understood supply and

00:14:40.118 --> 00:14:41.500
demand, by the way.
 

00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:44.470
This isn't the modern example.
 

00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:48.855
In the politics there's a story
of Thales who predicts a bad

00:14:48.855 --> 00:14:49.600
harvest.
 

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:52.038
He's a great mathematician and
astronomer,

00:14:52.038 --> 00:14:55.020
and he predicts a bad harvest
and he figures if he corners the

00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:56.830
wheat market he'll make a
fortune,

00:14:56.830 --> 00:14:58.668
which he does.
 

00:14:58.668 --> 00:15:01.664
Aristotle was famous for
saying, "Money is just a

00:15:01.664 --> 00:15:02.399
convention.
 

00:15:02.399 --> 00:15:03.870
It's not really worth anything.
 

00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:06.629
People just agree it's worth
something even if it's just

00:15:06.629 --> 00:15:09.591
pieces of paper or coins that
worth much more than the coins

00:15:09.591 --> 00:15:12.251
and how could that be,"
and anyway there's a long

00:15:12.251 --> 00:15:15.307
political connection to that,
the difference between nature

00:15:15.307 --> 00:15:17.477
and convention,
but anyhow he also said,

00:15:17.477 --> 00:15:20.953
"Loaning at interest was
unnatural and terrible,"

00:15:20.953 --> 00:15:24.311
but all the while he was saying
it the Delphic oracle was

00:15:24.311 --> 00:15:25.808
lending at interest.
 

00:15:25.808 --> 00:15:28.471
Economics is a Greek word,
household management,

00:15:28.471 --> 00:15:30.678
Xenophon wrote a whole book
about it.

00:15:30.678 --> 00:15:34.450
And just one more little
history or historical thing,

00:15:34.450 --> 00:15:38.750
Hermes, the messenger god,
the god of information,

00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:42.120
so remember the modern
financial view of information,

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:44.370
markets and information,
anyway he was the Greek god,

00:15:44.370 --> 00:15:46.100
messenger god,
and god of information.

00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:48.080
The word commerce comes from
Hermes.

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:52.543
And the Romans who took over
the same god and called him

00:15:52.543 --> 00:15:57.740
Mercury that's where we get the
word merchant from and market.

00:15:57.740 --> 00:16:05.538
Anyway, all right I'm not going
to bother with all this.

00:16:05.538 --> 00:16:07.700
I used to go on and on about
this.

00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:11.068
So the point is that in ancient
times the market was already

00:16:11.068 --> 00:16:14.323
established and this idea of
supply and demand had already

00:16:14.323 --> 00:16:17.980
been created but there are many
different kinds of markets,

00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:21.960
as I've just said,
and they work in many different

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:25.279
ways,
but we're going to describe

00:16:25.279 --> 00:16:27.158
them in one model.
 

00:16:27.158 --> 00:16:29.700
So just to mention a couple of
others,

00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:32.821
the model, the experiment we
ran in the class last time is

00:16:32.821 --> 00:16:36.458
called the double auction,
and the experiment I told you

00:16:36.458 --> 00:16:40.346
about and had you do was
actually an experiment that has

00:16:40.346 --> 00:16:41.690
been run before.
 

00:16:41.690 --> 00:16:44.304
And for the last ten or twenty
years many economists have run

00:16:44.304 --> 00:16:45.570
these sorts of experiments.
 

00:16:45.570 --> 00:16:48.207
It's amazing that before that,
before twenty or thirty years

00:16:48.207 --> 00:16:49.639
ago no one thought to do that.
 

00:16:49.639 --> 00:16:52.467
You didn't think that students
with no training and no

00:16:52.467 --> 00:16:55.990
experience could ever be led to
do something that was sensible,

00:16:55.990 --> 00:16:58.100
but actually you did quite
brilliantly.

00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:00.397
And by the way,
I've been told that those of

00:17:00.397 --> 00:17:02.841
you who performed,
maybe you're still in the first

00:17:02.841 --> 00:17:04.434
two rows,
you have to sign,

00:17:04.434 --> 00:17:08.474
even those of you who were left
at the end unable to trade you

00:17:08.474 --> 00:17:12.250
have to sign a release form so
you can't sue Yale for your

00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:16.288
disappointed faces appearing on
the internet afterwards.

00:17:16.288 --> 00:17:18.873
So anyway, the fact is we're
going to see that the people who

00:17:18.873 --> 00:17:21.069
were left at the end were
actually very rational.

00:17:21.069 --> 00:17:23.670
In fact nobody made a mistake.
 

00:17:23.670 --> 00:17:26.834
I've done this experiment now
ten or twenty times and I would

00:17:26.834 --> 00:17:29.945
say that half the time somebody
buys something for more than

00:17:29.945 --> 00:17:31.160
it's worth to them.
 

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:33.814
Nobody made a mistake and it
almost came out exactly as it

00:17:33.814 --> 00:17:35.910
should, but we'll come to that
in a second.

00:17:35.910 --> 00:17:40.125
Anyway, that double auction is
the most complicated kind of

00:17:40.125 --> 00:17:44.048
auction, but auctions have been
run for a long time.

00:17:44.048 --> 00:17:47.180
The first recorded auction you
may have heard about

00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:51.000
was--Herodotus describes the
Babylonian auction in 500 B.C.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.901
These are all going to be very
politically incorrect,

00:17:52.901 --> 00:17:54.730
but a lot of economics is
politically incorrect.

00:17:54.730 --> 00:17:57.348
Anyway, the first auction in
500 B.C.

00:17:57.348 --> 00:18:01.509
was the Babylonians auctioned
off all the 18-year-old women as

00:18:01.509 --> 00:18:05.875
wives and they auctioned them in
order of most beautiful to least

00:18:05.875 --> 00:18:06.828
beautiful.
 

00:18:06.828 --> 00:18:10.009
And so they got a very high
price and the price went down

00:18:10.009 --> 00:18:13.414
and down and down until it hit
zero and then it started going

00:18:13.414 --> 00:18:16.384
negative,
but they used the revenue from

00:18:16.384 --> 00:18:20.807
the first wives to subsidize the
husbands who would accept the

00:18:20.807 --> 00:18:23.490
other wives as it kept going
down.

00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:27.807
The next most awful auction was
the Roman Empire itself was

00:18:27.807 --> 00:18:29.000
auctioned off.
 

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.858
So if you saw the movie
Gladiator you may

00:18:31.858 --> 00:18:35.009
remember that Marcus Aurelius is
the great emperor,

00:18:35.009 --> 00:18:38.019
and he dies,
and then the evil Commodus

00:18:38.019 --> 00:18:42.327
takes over,
and he dies as a gladiator

00:18:42.327 --> 00:18:43.190
there.
 

00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:46.548
And then there's the senator
who you sort of hardly ever see,

00:18:46.548 --> 00:18:49.519
but you know he's the good
senator who somehow--

00:18:49.519 --> 00:18:52.279
he appears a few times--you
know that he's a good guy and

00:18:52.279 --> 00:18:53.558
he's going to take over.
 

00:18:53.558 --> 00:18:56.098
So his name is Pertinax,
and he does take over.

00:18:56.098 --> 00:18:59.160
But he's a good guy and he gets
killed almost immediately by the

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:01.733
Praetorian Guard and the
Praetorian Guard then doesn't

00:19:01.733 --> 00:19:04.940
know who to make emperor so they
auction the whole empire off.

00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:09.169
And so it's bought by Didius
Julianus, and he doesn't last

00:19:09.169 --> 00:19:11.838
very long, and he gets killed
too.

00:19:11.838 --> 00:19:13.808
The Roman legions come back and
kill him.

00:19:13.808 --> 00:19:18.156
So anyway, I grew up in Urbana,
Illinois and I used to go to

00:19:18.156 --> 00:19:22.210
these livestock auctions where
they'd sell something.

00:19:22.210 --> 00:19:24.809
They'd talk incredibly fast
&lt;&lt;speaking gibberish very

00:19:24.809 --> 00:19:26.288
fast like an auctioneer&gt;&gt;
 

00:19:26.288 --> 00:19:28.247
They talk like that and I don't
know how anybody can understand

00:19:28.247 --> 00:19:30.000
them,
and then there's the famous

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.890
slave auction,
so--where they'd actually

00:19:31.890 --> 00:19:33.922
auction slaves,
and you've seen it in the

00:19:33.922 --> 00:19:34.680
movies maybe.
 

00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:36.200
And that's where the
expression, "Going once,

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:38.087
going twice,
third and last call,

00:19:38.087 --> 00:19:39.646
going,
going, gone,"

00:19:39.646 --> 00:19:42.558
that's what they used to say at
the slave auction.

00:19:42.558 --> 00:19:46.880
So the double auction that we
saw was kind of what happened at

00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:50.279
the beginnings of the New York
Stock Exchange.

00:19:50.279 --> 00:19:52.881
The first traded
securities--there were only five

00:19:52.881 --> 00:19:54.670
of them, so how did they start?
 

00:19:54.670 --> 00:19:56.670
There was the Revolutionary War.
 

00:19:56.670 --> 00:19:59.834
A lot of states had borrowed
money and issued their bonds,

00:19:59.834 --> 00:20:02.499
and there are two banks,
Bank of New York and the

00:20:02.499 --> 00:20:04.109
National Bank of the U.S.
 

00:20:04.109 --> 00:20:05.269
that had issued bonds.
 

00:20:05.269 --> 00:20:08.298
Those were the only tradable
securities.

00:20:08.298 --> 00:20:10.900
And so a bunch of states had
issued bonds.

00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:15.834
So what happened was after the
Revolutionary War most people

00:20:15.834 --> 00:20:19.430
expected the bonds wouldn't be
paid back.

00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:21.252
After all, there was a huge
expense fighting the

00:20:21.252 --> 00:20:22.028
Revolutionary War.
 

00:20:22.028 --> 00:20:24.328
The government didn't have very
much money.

00:20:24.328 --> 00:20:29.057
The price of the bonds had
already collapsed,

00:20:29.057 --> 00:20:32.390
and Jefferson wanted the U.S.
 

00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:34.747
to just, you know,
wanted to leave the states and

00:20:34.747 --> 00:20:35.680
let them default.
 

00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:38.750
And Hamilton said that that
would be terrible,

00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:41.798
that the reputation of the
country was going to be made at

00:20:41.798 --> 00:20:44.740
what happened at the very
founding of the country and it

00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:46.400
was important that the U.S.
 

00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:48.048
never break a debt.
 

00:20:48.048 --> 00:20:51.836
So he persuaded Washington to
have the federal government buy

00:20:51.836 --> 00:20:55.558
all the debt of the states and
basically pay it all off,

00:20:55.558 --> 00:20:57.848
so none of the debts were
broken.

00:20:57.848 --> 00:20:59.759
Jefferson argued,
"That's crazy.

00:20:59.759 --> 00:21:01.332
The people who originally
bought the bonds,

00:21:01.332 --> 00:21:03.428
who lent the money to the
government, the farmers who did

00:21:03.428 --> 00:21:05.000
it they didn't own the bonds any
more.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.828
They probably all sold it for
twenty dollars.

00:21:06.828 --> 00:21:09.880
It was all this despicable
speculators who held the bonds.

00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:12.200
You're only going to enrich
them by paying them off."

00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:14.608
So he just wouldn't budge.
 

00:21:14.608 --> 00:21:17.185
And finally Hamilton,
supposedly--this is a famous

00:21:17.185 --> 00:21:19.503
story,
I assume it's true--Hamilton

00:21:19.503 --> 00:21:22.460
went to Washington and said,
"All right,

00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:25.278
move the capitol from New York
to Washington.

00:21:25.278 --> 00:21:27.824
That'll make Jefferson happy
because it's near his dear

00:21:27.824 --> 00:21:30.746
Virginia and in exchange get him
to concede that we have to pay

00:21:30.746 --> 00:21:31.828
off the debt."
 

00:21:31.828 --> 00:21:35.673
So Washington brokered that
deal and the debt was paid,

00:21:35.673 --> 00:21:36.670
and the U.S.
 

00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:40.355
since then has never defaulted
on its debt and virtually no

00:21:40.355 --> 00:21:42.200
other country can say that.
 

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:44.759
For example,
Russia has never paid a

00:21:44.759 --> 00:21:46.150
thirty-year debt.
 

00:21:46.150 --> 00:21:51.147
It always has defaulted,
and we'll come back to that a

00:21:51.147 --> 00:21:56.430
little later when we talk about
the crisis of '97-'98.

00:21:56.430 --> 00:21:59.069
Anyway, so these five
securities--three government

00:21:59.069 --> 00:22:01.926
bonds and these two from the
Revolutionary War and two

00:22:01.926 --> 00:22:03.724
banks--
were the only securities sold

00:22:03.724 --> 00:22:06.259
and they used to be sold every
day in a double auction exactly

00:22:06.259 --> 00:22:08.587
as the kind that we described
where people would yell and

00:22:08.587 --> 00:22:10.998
scream at each other and the
whole thing would be over in a

00:22:10.998 --> 00:22:12.843
few minutes,
and that would be it for the

00:22:12.843 --> 00:22:15.123
day, and then the next day they
would do the same thing over and

00:22:15.123 --> 00:22:15.630
over again.
 

00:22:15.630 --> 00:22:19.210
Well, they had to stop that
when Alexander Duer,

00:22:19.210 --> 00:22:21.993
who was Hamilton's assistant,
started using his inside

00:22:21.993 --> 00:22:25.093
information about whether the
government was or wasn't going

00:22:25.093 --> 00:22:28.140
to make all its payments and
whether they're going to issue

00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:31.868
new bonds and stuff like that to
try and speculate on the market.

00:22:31.868 --> 00:22:33.720
And he would do it all by
borrowing.

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:36.393
He'd borrow a huge amount of
money and with the borrowed

00:22:36.393 --> 00:22:39.053
money he'd buy bonds,
and if the price went against

00:22:39.053 --> 00:22:41.680
him he'd lose a lot more because
he was leveraged.

00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:47.270
And so it caused gigantic
gyrations in the market and the

00:22:47.270 --> 00:22:53.261
whole thing had to be changed,
and it was made a much smaller

00:22:53.261 --> 00:22:55.259
group of people.
 

00:22:55.259 --> 00:22:57.618
Anyway, so that was the
beginnings of it.

00:22:57.618 --> 00:23:00.760
And we're going to come back to
that because that view of the

00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:03.953
gyrations of the market being
caused by too much borrowing and

00:23:03.953 --> 00:23:06.884
speculation is exactly the view
that I'm going to take in

00:23:06.884 --> 00:23:08.980
explaining the most recent
crisis.

00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:13.890
So anyway, you remember what we
did in our experiment.

00:23:13.890 --> 00:23:18.156
We had eight buyers whose
reservation prices are those

00:23:18.156 --> 00:23:20.170
eight numbers up there.
 

00:23:20.170 --> 00:23:22.710
That's what each person thought
it was worth to him.

00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:25.480
Each person knew his own price,
but not any of the others.

00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:28.630
I told you almost nothing about
what was going on.

00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:29.880
There was some context.
 

00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:33.067
I gave an example of a person
who thought it was worth

00:23:33.067 --> 00:23:34.762
fifteen,
so you had some idea,

00:23:34.762 --> 00:23:37.470
probably, from that example
that the numbers weren't ten

00:23:37.470 --> 00:23:39.970
thousand,
plus you knew your own number.

00:23:39.970 --> 00:23:42.358
But other than that you knew
absolutely nothing and each

00:23:42.358 --> 00:23:45.009
buyer knew her own number and
not any of the other numbers.

00:23:45.009 --> 00:23:47.798
So here we have sixteen
different pieces of information.

00:23:47.798 --> 00:23:52.078
Everybody has an incentive to
keep her information secret.

00:23:52.078 --> 00:23:55.470
Why should anybody admit that
she's willing to sell at six?

00:23:55.470 --> 00:23:57.519
She'll get a worse price.
 

00:23:57.519 --> 00:24:00.410
She's going to lie and say the
thing is much more.

00:24:00.410 --> 00:24:02.801
She's going to make an argument
that says, "Well,

00:24:02.801 --> 00:24:05.103
these are football,"
okay, I better try the guy

00:24:05.103 --> 00:24:05.509
here.
 

00:24:05.509 --> 00:24:07.922
The forty-four guy,
he's going to say,

00:24:07.922 --> 00:24:10.529
"This is a football
ticket."

00:24:10.529 --> 00:24:11.319
No, sorry.
 

00:24:11.319 --> 00:24:11.960
What am I going to do?
 

00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:14.509
Let's say she's a forty-four.
 

00:24:14.509 --> 00:24:16.152
She's going to say,
"Football tickets,

00:24:16.152 --> 00:24:17.599
they're completely
worthless."

00:24:17.599 --> 00:24:18.250
I'm doing a stereotype.
 

00:24:18.250 --> 00:24:19.259
"These are completely
worthless.

00:24:19.259 --> 00:24:20.630
Who would want to go to a
football game?

00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:21.868
I certainly don't want to go to
a football game.

00:24:21.868 --> 00:24:25.088
They can't be worth any more
than twelve or something."

00:24:25.088 --> 00:24:27.190
So all the buyers,
the blue buyers,

00:24:27.190 --> 00:24:29.631
are going to be making
arguments suggesting the price

00:24:29.631 --> 00:24:31.670
should be low,
reasons why the stuff really

00:24:31.670 --> 00:24:32.690
isn't worth very much.
 

00:24:32.690 --> 00:24:35.381
All the sellers are going to be
making arguments saying the

00:24:35.381 --> 00:24:37.470
stuff is intrinsically
incredibly valuable.

00:24:37.470 --> 00:24:39.269
Football tickets are incredibly
important.

00:24:39.269 --> 00:24:42.608
So that's the facts.
 

00:24:42.608 --> 00:24:45.519
Now you need a model and a
theory that fits the facts,

00:24:45.519 --> 00:24:48.125
and I'm belaboring the obvious,
but the obvious is always

00:24:48.125 --> 00:24:51.480
central to everything,
the obvious theory would go

00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:54.419
something like,
well, somehow these people are

00:24:54.419 --> 00:24:57.433
going to get matched up and
maybe thirty-eight will sell to

00:24:57.433 --> 00:24:59.930
forty-four and all eight things
will be sold.

00:24:59.930 --> 00:25:02.470
And the more transactions you
have the better.

00:25:02.470 --> 00:25:05.930
And what else might a theory
say, a wrong theory?

00:25:05.930 --> 00:25:09.012
It might say the more people in
red, or the more people making

00:25:09.012 --> 00:25:12.046
arguments that the price should
be higher the more compelling

00:25:12.046 --> 00:25:13.308
the argument will be.
 

00:25:13.308 --> 00:25:15.618
You'll be overwhelmed by
numbers and you'll think that

00:25:15.618 --> 00:25:17.929
the price should be higher
because more people will be

00:25:17.929 --> 00:25:19.278
arguing for a higher price.
 

00:25:19.278 --> 00:25:21.710
But the theory,
the economic theory is the

00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:23.430
exact opposite of all that.
 

00:25:23.430 --> 00:25:28.413
So the economic theory is quite
a shocking theory,

00:25:28.413 --> 00:25:29.430
I think.
 

00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:32.358
It starts with a situation
where people are arguing and

00:25:32.358 --> 00:25:33.769
talking about the price.
 

00:25:33.769 --> 00:25:36.742
They're not doing anything else
but making arguments about the

00:25:36.742 --> 00:25:38.788
price and making offers about
the price.

00:25:38.788 --> 00:25:40.548
They're haggling about the
price.

00:25:40.548 --> 00:25:44.138
The whole of the activity is
about the price and how to

00:25:44.138 --> 00:25:46.400
change it and what it should be.
 

00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:48.338
The economic theory,
the first theory,

00:25:48.338 --> 00:25:49.858
the most important theory of
economics,

00:25:49.858 --> 00:25:54.928
supply and demand,
is that--so that describes what

00:25:54.928 --> 00:25:57.608
happened,
is the exact opposite.

00:25:57.608 --> 00:26:02.319
The theory says let's suppose
that a price appeared out of

00:26:02.319 --> 00:26:03.230
thin air.
 

00:26:03.230 --> 00:26:05.380
There was no arguing about the
price.

00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:08.384
Nobody even thinks they have
any chance of changing the

00:26:08.384 --> 00:26:08.828
price.
 

00:26:08.828 --> 00:26:11.740
Somehow a price gets into
everybody's head,

00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:15.164
the price of twenty-five and at
that price of twenty-five

00:26:15.164 --> 00:26:18.528
everybody who wants to buy buys
as much as they want.

00:26:18.528 --> 00:26:22.440
So mister forty-four he thinks
the ticket is worth forty-four.

00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:25.150
If he can buy it for
twenty-five he'll want to buy.

00:26:25.150 --> 00:26:27.653
Forty thinks it's worth forty
and the price is only

00:26:27.653 --> 00:26:29.807
twenty-five so,
again, he's going to gain by

00:26:29.807 --> 00:26:31.308
buying, he'll want to buy.
 

00:26:31.308 --> 00:26:33.279
Twelve thinks it's only worth
twelve.

00:26:33.279 --> 00:26:35.480
He's not going to pay
twenty-five for it.

00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:37.478
And similarly the sellers,
seller number ten,

00:26:37.478 --> 00:26:39.295
she's going to say,
"Okay, I can get

00:26:39.295 --> 00:26:40.339
twenty-five for it.
 

00:26:40.339 --> 00:26:42.348
It was worth ten.
 

00:26:42.348 --> 00:26:43.950
It's a good deal for me to
do."

00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:47.381
So the theory says somehow
miraculously the price comes out

00:26:47.381 --> 00:26:48.210
of thin air.
 

00:26:48.210 --> 00:26:49.140
It's given.
 

00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:53.133
Everybody taking that price as
given, figuring they have no

00:26:53.133 --> 00:26:56.507
power to change it,
buys or sells all they want at

00:26:56.507 --> 00:26:57.539
that price.
 

00:26:57.539 --> 00:26:59.130
And so that's the theory.
 

00:26:59.130 --> 00:27:02.069
So it's price taking,
out of thin air.

00:27:02.069 --> 00:27:03.288
The price comes from somewhere.
 

00:27:03.288 --> 00:27:08.584
Everybody acts by maximizing,
doing the best for them given

00:27:08.584 --> 00:27:09.680
the price.
 

00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:13.673
They all understand what the
price is, and the price has

00:27:13.673 --> 00:27:17.740
miraculously been imagined at
exactly the level that will

00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:19.630
clear all the markets.
 

00:27:19.630 --> 00:27:21.631
So everyone who wants to buy is
able to, and everyone who wants

00:27:21.631 --> 00:27:22.309
to sell is able to.
 

00:27:22.309 --> 00:27:23.690
That's the theory.
 

00:27:23.690 --> 00:27:26.747
The theory's completely the
opposite of what common sense

00:27:26.747 --> 00:27:29.243
suggests since,
as I said, the whole thing was

00:27:29.243 --> 00:27:32.321
this grappling and groping and
pushing and shoving and yelling

00:27:32.321 --> 00:27:35.401
and arguing about what the price
should be and the theory says

00:27:35.401 --> 00:27:37.420
nobody says a word about the
price.

00:27:37.420 --> 00:27:40.779
They just take it as given and
then they act after that.

00:27:40.779 --> 00:27:44.496
So the most basic economic
model is a paradox,

00:27:44.496 --> 00:27:48.460
and good economics is almost
always a paradox.

00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:51.272
If you want to make a
convincing economic argument you

00:27:51.272 --> 00:27:53.608
almost always say it in a
paradoxical way.

00:27:53.608 --> 00:27:57.398
And so going back to the very
beginning where we said what a

00:27:57.398 --> 00:27:59.834
model is,
the standard economic model is

00:27:59.834 --> 00:28:03.026
you take the exogenous things,
which in this case are the

00:28:03.026 --> 00:28:05.150
reservation prices of all the
people,

00:28:05.150 --> 00:28:07.818
you have to solve equations
which are here,

00:28:07.818 --> 00:28:10.386
supply equals demand,
which determines the endogenous

00:28:10.386 --> 00:28:12.769
variables,
which are the price and who

00:28:12.769 --> 00:28:14.058
buys and who sells.
 

00:28:14.058 --> 00:28:17.690
And the reason the theory is
always often paradoxical is if

00:28:17.690 --> 00:28:20.943
you change some exogenous
variable it looks like it's

00:28:20.943 --> 00:28:24.450
going to move things in a
commonsensical direction,

00:28:24.450 --> 00:28:27.190
but then when people react to
the changed environment--

00:28:27.190 --> 00:28:31.230
X is a reaction to the change
in E--

00:28:31.230 --> 00:28:34.116
and the change in X might be so
big and so important that it

00:28:34.116 --> 00:28:35.880
reverses the apparent change in
E.

00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:38.880
So you get these surprising
conclusions.

00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:40.858
"If everybody tries to
save more,"

00:28:40.858 --> 00:28:43.505
Keynes said,
"It may be that everyone

00:28:43.505 --> 00:28:46.808
will end up saving less,"
things like that.

00:28:46.808 --> 00:28:51.053
So economics at its best takes
advantage of its paradoxical

00:28:51.053 --> 00:28:55.369
nature at its heart and uses
that as a rhetorical device.

00:28:55.369 --> 00:28:56.990
So it's a non-obvious theory.
 

00:28:56.990 --> 00:28:58.318
Now, why do we believe the
theory?

00:28:58.318 --> 00:29:02.325
Well, all those different
examples I gave you of markets

00:29:02.325 --> 00:29:04.000
they all seem to fit.
 

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:07.682
I forgot where they were and I
don't even remember what they

00:29:07.682 --> 00:29:08.119
were.
 

00:29:08.119 --> 00:29:12.230
I don't remember what they were.
 

00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:15.039
The shopping center thing,
the haggling,

00:29:15.039 --> 00:29:18.675
the tâtonnement Bourse,
the commodities futures,

00:29:18.675 --> 00:29:22.001
all that, if you look after the
fact at what people wanted to do

00:29:22.001 --> 00:29:24.798
and what price emerged it seems
to fit the theory.

00:29:24.798 --> 00:29:27.221
So there's overwhelming
evidence that this theory seems

00:29:27.221 --> 00:29:27.670
to work.
 

00:29:27.670 --> 00:29:31.832
And you saw that in our own
example, in our experiment where

00:29:31.832 --> 00:29:35.430
you had no training at all,
it came pretty close.

00:29:35.430 --> 00:29:41.078
So all these five red sellers
they all sold,

00:29:41.078 --> 00:29:44.164
I think, and the five buyers
the only difference was that

00:29:44.164 --> 00:29:46.700
instead of twenty-six buying
twenty bought,

00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:49.328
and the prices were all between
twenty and twenty-five,

00:29:49.328 --> 00:29:51.029
so they weren't exactly
twenty-five,

00:29:51.029 --> 00:29:52.808
but they were very close to
twenty-five.

00:29:52.808 --> 00:29:55.701
And the ten people who were
supposed to have bought and

00:29:55.701 --> 00:29:58.858
sold, well nine out of the ten
actually did buy and sell.

00:29:58.858 --> 00:30:02.696
So it's pretty hard to match a
theory like that with so little

00:30:02.696 --> 00:30:03.390
practice.
 

00:30:03.390 --> 00:30:12.440
I mean, I've always found it
quite astonishing.

00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:15.858
Why is this happening?
 

00:30:15.858 --> 00:30:22.025
Does anyone want to make a
comment or ask a question about

00:30:22.025 --> 00:30:23.538
this theory?
 

00:30:23.538 --> 00:30:25.788
All right, well what are the
properties of equilibrium you

00:30:25.788 --> 00:30:26.500
get out of this?
 

00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:28.920
Well, everyone trades at one
price.

00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:31.390
So this is going to be very
important for finance,

00:30:31.390 --> 00:30:33.858
the idea that there's one price
for everything.

00:30:33.858 --> 00:30:42.809
Then you can also define
the--so you know what the theory

00:30:42.809 --> 00:30:43.608
is.
 

00:30:43.608 --> 00:30:48.060
I already told you the
exogenous variables are the

00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:49.970
reservation values.
 

00:30:49.970 --> 00:30:53.067
The endogenous variable is the
price that emerges and who buys

00:30:53.067 --> 00:30:53.880
and who sells.
 

00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:56.700
So why is this such a good
outcome?

00:30:56.700 --> 00:30:58.108
It seems like a terrible
outcome.

00:30:58.108 --> 00:31:01.034
There are those six people
standing there at the end unable

00:31:01.034 --> 00:31:02.576
to trade,
facing the camera,

00:31:02.576 --> 00:31:05.596
looking slightly embarrassed
that all their friends managed

00:31:05.596 --> 00:31:08.354
to buy and sell and they
couldn't do it and what's the

00:31:08.354 --> 00:31:09.500
matter with them.
 

00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:10.450
So they feel bad.
 

00:31:10.450 --> 00:31:12.140
They feel discriminated against.
 

00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:14.390
It doesn't look like it's such
a great thing.

00:31:14.390 --> 00:31:17.578
We know that there's another
way of making all eight buyers

00:31:17.578 --> 00:31:20.990
purchase from all eight sellers
just by doing the corresponding

00:31:20.990 --> 00:31:21.759
one above.
 

00:31:21.759 --> 00:31:23.920
What's so good about the market
outcome?

00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:25.338
It actually doesn't sound so
great.

00:31:25.338 --> 00:31:30.092
Well, the answer is it is great
and what's great about is that

00:31:30.092 --> 00:31:34.611
within two minutes the market
figured out enough about what

00:31:34.611 --> 00:31:39.207
everybody valued the football
tickets at to put the football

00:31:39.207 --> 00:31:43.960
tickets in the ten peoples'
hands who valued them most.

00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:48.328
All right, so in the end those
five blue guys--

00:31:48.328 --> 00:31:55.078
almost without that one
exception--and the one,

00:31:55.078 --> 00:32:00.705
two, three red sellers,
those three sellers and those

00:32:00.705 --> 00:32:03.671
five buyers,
the top eight people ended up

00:32:03.671 --> 00:32:06.538
with the eight football tickets
and the bottom eight didn't end

00:32:06.538 --> 00:32:08.019
up with any football tickets.
 

00:32:08.019 --> 00:32:10.737
So the football tickets got put
into the hands of the people who

00:32:10.737 --> 00:32:11.730
valued them the most.
 

00:32:11.730 --> 00:32:14.250
And so, as I said,
if you just simply sat there

00:32:14.250 --> 00:32:17.594
and went through sixteen tickets
and sorted them into most and

00:32:17.594 --> 00:32:20.771
least and then tried to arrange
all the football tickets it

00:32:20.771 --> 00:32:24.352
would have taken almost as long,
and that would have been with

00:32:24.352 --> 00:32:26.588
benefit of knowing what all the
numbers are.

00:32:26.588 --> 00:32:29.713
Here the market does it not
knowing what the numbers are and

00:32:29.713 --> 00:32:33.103
the only accessed information is
through people who don't want to

00:32:33.103 --> 00:32:36.400
reveal their numbers,
and still the market figured it

00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:36.710
out.
 

00:32:36.710 --> 00:32:41.150
All right, so that's the
message.

00:32:41.150 --> 00:32:43.980
So we have a model which is
surprising,

00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:48.751
which seems to describe the
facts, and which gives us a

00:32:48.751 --> 00:32:54.318
surprising conclusion and an
incredibly important conclusion.

00:32:54.318 --> 00:32:57.955
The market is an extremely
useful mechanism of eliciting

00:32:57.955 --> 00:33:01.790
information and turning the
information into something that

00:33:01.790 --> 00:33:05.564
allocates things efficiently,
and you couldn't do better than

00:33:05.564 --> 00:33:05.858
that.
 

00:33:05.858 --> 00:33:10.894
No other arrangement would have
put football tickets in the

00:33:10.894 --> 00:33:14.278
hands of people who like them
better.

00:33:14.278 --> 00:33:21.666
So Hayek described the market
as a great calculating machine,

00:33:21.666 --> 00:33:24.130
and well so it is.
 

00:33:24.130 --> 00:33:26.800
Now, there are a couple other
things that you can get out of

00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:27.390
this model.
 

00:33:27.390 --> 00:33:34.256
Another lesson of this model is
that the equilibrium price is

00:33:34.256 --> 00:33:40.548
equal not to the average of the
price of the buyers,

00:33:40.548 --> 00:33:42.130
or the average of the price of
the sellers,

00:33:42.130 --> 00:33:44.480
or the average of all the
prices or something like that.

00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:49.038
It's equal to what the marginal
buyer thinks it's worth.

00:33:49.038 --> 00:33:51.940
So there's a critical marginal
buyer and marginal seller.

00:33:51.940 --> 00:33:54.670
They're almost indifferent to
buying or selling.

00:33:54.670 --> 00:33:55.670
They could go either way.
 

00:33:55.670 --> 00:33:57.170
They're pretty close to buying
or selling.

00:33:57.170 --> 00:34:02.464
The price is going to turn out
to be very close to that

00:34:02.464 --> 00:34:05.798
valuation of the marginal buyer.
 

00:34:05.798 --> 00:34:09.746
So somehow the margin is going
to play a big--so the word

00:34:09.746 --> 00:34:14.045
marginal, this is an invention
in 1871, is going to play a big

00:34:14.045 --> 00:34:16.230
role in economic reasoning.
 

00:34:16.230 --> 00:34:18.530
So it gives us a completely
different understanding.

00:34:18.530 --> 00:34:21.208
You might think that the price
of tickets has something to do

00:34:21.208 --> 00:34:23.708
with their total value or
average value or something like

00:34:23.708 --> 00:34:24.110
that.
 

00:34:24.110 --> 00:34:27.215
It's got to do with the value
of a marginal person,

00:34:27.215 --> 00:34:29.079
the person just on the edge.
 

00:34:29.079 --> 00:34:31.760
So then the comparative statics
are that the,

00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:34.329
as I said, the surprising thing
that if you change a

00:34:34.329 --> 00:34:36.543
non-marginal person,
you take mister forty-four,

00:34:36.543 --> 00:34:39.110
the buyer at the top,
you change him to fifty.

00:34:39.110 --> 00:34:41.567
Looks like the buyers are now
more desperate to buy,

00:34:41.567 --> 00:34:43.349
won't have any effect on the
price.

00:34:43.349 --> 00:34:46.534
You change that seller,
miss six, you change her to two

00:34:46.534 --> 00:34:48.847
or to eight,
again, it'll have no effect on

00:34:48.847 --> 00:34:51.090
the price,
because those two people,

00:34:51.090 --> 00:34:54.030
the guy at forty-four and the
lady at six,

00:34:54.030 --> 00:34:57.820
they're not marginal so they
don't affect the price.

00:34:57.820 --> 00:35:00.954
You add some more buyers you
might think that they're arguing

00:35:00.954 --> 00:35:04.811
for the price to be lower,
as I said you're going to end

00:35:04.811 --> 00:35:09.090
up raising the price or else
having no effect on it if

00:35:09.090 --> 00:35:11.030
they're not marginal.
 

00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:13.260
Now one more thing,
one last thing,

00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:15.679
one last message of this model,
if you didn't know--

00:35:15.679 --> 00:35:19.416
we knew the reservation prices
ourselves because I set up the

00:35:19.416 --> 00:35:22.327
experiment,
but if you didn't know it you

00:35:22.327 --> 00:35:25.000
could infer something from the
price.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:27.260
So part of finance is going in
the backwards direction.

00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:29.710
The theory says take the
exogenous variables.

00:35:29.710 --> 00:35:32.429
Predict what the equilibrium's
going to be.

00:35:32.429 --> 00:35:34.835
Financial theory does that,
but often it goes in the

00:35:34.835 --> 00:35:35.780
reverse direction.
 

00:35:35.780 --> 00:35:37.489
We can see what the prices are.
 

00:35:37.489 --> 00:35:42.659
That must tell us something
about the exogenous valuations.

00:35:42.659 --> 00:35:45.465
So financial theory says,
"Well if the price is such

00:35:45.465 --> 00:35:48.523
and such it must mean that at
least the marginal person values

00:35:48.523 --> 00:35:51.530
it at such and such and so
that's why the price is that.

00:35:51.530 --> 00:35:54.400
It's the value of some special
persons."

00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:57.219
So we'll come back to that
argument.

00:35:57.219 --> 00:36:03.202
So that lesson of economics,
that's the first economic

00:36:03.202 --> 00:36:05.523
model,
the most important economic

00:36:05.523 --> 00:36:08.514
model, we're going to now have
to generalize it in all kinds of

00:36:08.514 --> 00:36:10.222
ways,
but it's always going to come

00:36:10.222 --> 00:36:11.409
back to that same message.
 

00:36:11.409 --> 00:36:14.398
And so Adam Smith he was the
one who first invented the

00:36:14.398 --> 00:36:15.340
invisible hand.
 

00:36:15.340 --> 00:36:17.518
There was nothing mathematical
in what he said.

00:36:17.518 --> 00:36:21.320
Ricardo was the first one to
make a model.

00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:23.489
Marx said, I don't have time to
talk about Marx,

00:36:23.489 --> 00:36:25.780
but he had quite elaborate
models, actually,

00:36:25.780 --> 00:36:31.900
and his verbal arguments
conceal a huge mathematical

00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:33.340
apparatus.
 

00:36:33.340 --> 00:36:35.902
On his deathbed,
by the way, he was trying to

00:36:35.902 --> 00:36:37.710
learn calculus,
incidentally.

00:36:37.710 --> 00:36:41.670
So Jevons, Menger and Walras
1871 right after Marx's famous

00:36:41.670 --> 00:36:45.632
Kapital came out in
1867 they invented the idea of

00:36:45.632 --> 00:36:49.730
the margin and things like that
and the critique therefore of

00:36:49.730 --> 00:36:51.793
Marx,
and Marx was trying to figure

00:36:51.793 --> 00:36:53.079
out what they were all about.
 

00:36:53.079 --> 00:36:56.034
Anyway, Marshall was a great
economist, Fisher,

00:36:56.034 --> 00:36:58.219
Samuelson, Hicks,
Arrow, Debreu;

00:36:58.219 --> 00:37:01.673
these are the most famous
people who extended this model

00:37:01.673 --> 00:37:05.567
and the logic of laissez faire
and regulation which we're going

00:37:05.567 --> 00:37:06.510
to come to.
 

00:37:06.510 --> 00:37:08.693
Now what are the two ways we
have to generalize,

00:37:08.693 --> 00:37:11.250
there are three ways we have to
generalize the model.

00:37:11.250 --> 00:37:16.340
We have to think of many
commodities, not just one.

00:37:16.340 --> 00:37:18.876
We have to think of people
buying more than one unit of a

00:37:18.876 --> 00:37:19.420
commodity.
 

00:37:19.420 --> 00:37:21.900
That's called general
equilibrium.

00:37:21.900 --> 00:37:24.409
And then we have to put in
financial things.

00:37:24.409 --> 00:37:27.429
We have to put in stocks and
bonds and things like that.

00:37:27.429 --> 00:37:30.572
It sounds like things are going
to get so complicated,

00:37:30.572 --> 00:37:33.893
but in fact it turns out I'm
going to spend another class

00:37:33.893 --> 00:37:35.909
after this talking about this.
 

00:37:35.909 --> 00:37:38.329
There's not that much
complication to get all those

00:37:38.329 --> 00:37:38.909
things in.
 

00:37:38.909 --> 00:37:40.829
There'll be two more classes
about this.

00:37:40.829 --> 00:37:43.376
So I'm recapitulating all that
you have to know for the

00:37:43.376 --> 00:37:45.876
purposes of this class from
introductory economics and

00:37:45.876 --> 00:37:47.150
intermediate economics.
 

00:37:47.150 --> 00:37:50.184
The only thing you have to know
you'll hear now in these two

00:37:50.184 --> 00:37:53.219
classes and some of you will
find it's incomprehensible,

00:37:53.219 --> 00:37:56.000
and so that's one good reason
for doing it now.

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:58.313
You find out right at the
beginning whether it's too

00:37:58.313 --> 00:37:59.630
complicated to bother with.
 

00:37:59.630 --> 00:38:05.599
So anyway, I'm going to keep
going now to extend the model.

00:38:05.599 --> 00:38:09.369
So the biggest advance,
the next advance,

00:38:09.369 --> 00:38:14.090
sort of, which was related to
this is Adam Smith said,

00:38:14.090 --> 00:38:18.112
"How could it be that
water which is so valuable has

00:38:18.112 --> 00:38:21.077
such a low price,
and diamonds which are so

00:38:21.077 --> 00:38:24.440
useless, basically,
to everybody has such a high

00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:24.960
price?
 

00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:28.393
I mean, there's not some
marginal buyer who thinks that

00:38:28.393 --> 00:38:32.018
diamonds are somehow more
important to him than water,

00:38:32.018 --> 00:38:35.121
so how could it be that water's
got a much lower price than

00:38:35.121 --> 00:38:38.599
diamonds and everybody would say
that it's more valuable?"

00:38:38.599 --> 00:38:44.175
Well, to answer that question
what we have to do is we have to

00:38:44.175 --> 00:38:50.210
imagine that people are capable
of consuming more than one good.

00:38:50.210 --> 00:38:55.101
So for instance,
let's imagine that there's good

00:38:55.101 --> 00:39:00.304
X here which is the football
tickets we had before,

00:39:00.304 --> 00:39:03.739
and you remember our numbers.
 

00:39:03.739 --> 00:39:05.739
Let's just go back to the
numbers for a second.

00:39:05.739 --> 00:39:07.469
I'll stay here for a while.
 

00:39:07.469 --> 00:39:10.610
The first buyer thought one
ticket was worth forty-four.

00:39:10.610 --> 00:39:13.130
A second ticket was useless to
that buyer.

00:39:13.130 --> 00:39:28.239
Well, suppose we write utility
here.

00:39:28.239 --> 00:39:32.630
Now, this first buyer--let's
put this forty-four here--this

00:39:32.630 --> 00:39:36.717
first buyer you might say got
utility of forty-four for

00:39:36.717 --> 00:39:38.460
holding one ticket.
 

00:39:38.460 --> 00:39:41.340
If he held half a ticket maybe
his utility would be twenty-two.

00:39:41.340 --> 00:39:44.255
Now, in fact we know that half
a ticket doesn't get you into a

00:39:44.255 --> 00:39:46.309
game so his utility would really
be zero.

00:39:46.309 --> 00:39:49.701
When we're talking about
thousands of tickets to a

00:39:49.701 --> 00:39:53.300
football game a half or one it's
not so important.

00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:58.954
Let's just say his utility went
up linearly with the quantity of

00:39:58.954 --> 00:40:00.480
tickets he had.
 

00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:04.016
To make a discrete variable a
continuous variable his utility

00:40:04.016 --> 00:40:07.199
goes up linear at the rate of
forty-four per ticket.

00:40:07.199 --> 00:40:11.173
Well, after one ticket he gets
no extra utility out of holding

00:40:11.173 --> 00:40:15.409
any more tickets so his utility
might look something like that.

00:40:15.409 --> 00:40:19.197
But now let's imagine he wanted
two tickets and that the first

00:40:19.197 --> 00:40:23.047
ticket was important to him and
the second ticket he could take

00:40:23.047 --> 00:40:27.400
his girlfriend,
let's say, but he's not quite

00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:30.940
as worried about her as himself.
 

00:40:30.940 --> 00:40:34.833
So let's say that he,
for the second ticket,

00:40:34.833 --> 00:40:37.369
gets an extra forty utils.
 

00:40:37.369 --> 00:40:40.710
So after you get to ticket
number two his utility is going

00:40:40.710 --> 00:40:44.050
to be up to eighty-four,
which is forty-four and forty.

00:40:44.050 --> 00:40:48.751
Now you notice that the rate of
increase of utility per unit of

00:40:48.751 --> 00:40:53.150
ticket is forty-four here and
then it switches to forty.

00:40:53.150 --> 00:41:01.469
Okay, now, why do I--why do
I--okay, and if he wanted one

00:41:01.469 --> 00:41:10.382
more ticket maybe he'd only get
utility of one-twenty for the

00:41:10.382 --> 00:41:12.760
last ticket.
 

00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:16.358
So for a third ticket his
utility would--three goes up

00:41:16.358 --> 00:41:19.280
like that, utility would go up
like this.

00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:26.518
It's a little flatter again.
 

00:41:26.518 --> 00:41:29.893
So here we have a utility
function which is increasing the

00:41:29.893 --> 00:41:31.610
number of tickets you hold.
 

00:41:31.610 --> 00:41:33.780
It's not restricted to just
having one ticket,

00:41:33.780 --> 00:41:36.637
but the rate of increase goes
down as you get more and more

00:41:36.637 --> 00:41:39.150
tickets from the rate of
increase of forty-four,

00:41:39.150 --> 00:41:42.090
to the rate of increase of
forty, to the rate of increase

00:41:42.090 --> 00:41:42.929
of thirty-six.
 

00:41:42.929 --> 00:41:45.911
Now, if you ask this person how
many tickets does he want to

00:41:45.911 --> 00:41:47.679
buy, well what's he going to
say?

00:41:47.679 --> 00:41:49.750
How's he going to figure out
how much to buy?

00:41:49.750 --> 00:41:53.713
This is his utility,
but now I claim this person

00:41:53.713 --> 00:41:58.943
buying multiple tickets is going
to behave exactly like the top

00:41:58.943 --> 00:42:02.739
three people up there would have
behaved.

00:42:02.739 --> 00:42:05.909
So his utility at the top for
three tickets is one-twenty,

00:42:05.909 --> 00:42:08.579
for two is eighty-four,
for one is forty-four.

00:42:08.579 --> 00:42:10.909
Those sound like important
numbers, his total utility,

00:42:10.909 --> 00:42:12.889
but actually they're not
important numbers.

00:42:12.889 --> 00:42:16.110
The important number is the
marginal utility.

00:42:16.110 --> 00:42:19.505
So the marginal utility,
so if you go one,

00:42:19.505 --> 00:42:23.398
two and three here,
the marginal utility for the

00:42:23.398 --> 00:42:26.050
first ticket was forty-four.
 

00:42:26.050 --> 00:42:29.744
The marginal utility for the
second ticket was forty,

00:42:29.744 --> 00:42:34.219
and the marginal utility for
the third ticket was thirty-six.

00:42:34.219 --> 00:42:37.018
So those are the important
numbers, the same numbers that

00:42:37.018 --> 00:42:37.769
are up there.
 

00:42:37.769 --> 00:42:38.650
Why is that?
 

00:42:38.650 --> 00:42:40.480
Well, let's ask the guy.
 

00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:43.190
This person who now likes three
tickets,

00:42:43.190 --> 00:42:46.809
after here let's say he's flat
so it goes down to zero,

00:42:46.809 --> 00:42:50.811
let's ask him how many tickets
would he buy at the price of

00:42:50.811 --> 00:42:51.639
forty-two.
 

00:42:51.639 --> 00:42:55.989
Well, from this utility
function you have to say if I

00:42:55.989 --> 00:43:01.010
bought one ticket I'd have a
utility of forty-four minus--

00:43:01.010 --> 00:43:06.101
let's say my utility function
now is U of X and money is this

00:43:06.101 --> 00:43:07.460
function of X.
 

00:43:07.460 --> 00:43:08.929
I'll call this U of X.
 

00:43:08.929 --> 00:43:10.030
I don't want to write it out.
 

00:43:10.030 --> 00:43:14.150
This is U of X plus M for money.
 

00:43:14.150 --> 00:43:17.193
So he says, "If I buy one
ticket at a price of forty-four

00:43:17.193 --> 00:43:20.152
I lose forty-two from here,
but I gain forty-four from

00:43:20.152 --> 00:43:22.570
here, so I probably should buy
one ticket.

00:43:22.570 --> 00:43:25.887
If I buy a second ticket this
number goes up to eighty-four

00:43:25.887 --> 00:43:28.690
and now this one goes down by
forty-two twice,

00:43:28.690 --> 00:43:30.989
so maybe it's not such a great
idea."

00:43:30.989 --> 00:43:32.610
So what is he actually thinking?
 

00:43:32.610 --> 00:43:35.925
All he's doing is he's looking
at the price in this axis and

00:43:35.925 --> 00:43:39.186
comparing it to his marginal
utility, the extra utility out

00:43:39.186 --> 00:43:40.929
of getting an extra ticket.
 

00:43:40.929 --> 00:43:43.219
So if the price is forty-two
here he's going to say,

00:43:43.219 --> 00:43:45.465
"Well, at a price of
forty-two the first one's

00:43:45.465 --> 00:43:46.139
worthwhile.
 

00:43:46.139 --> 00:43:48.050
I'm getting more utility out of
that.

00:43:48.050 --> 00:43:50.436
After that it's stupid to buy
another ticket because I'm

00:43:50.436 --> 00:43:52.692
getting extra utility of forty
compared to a price of

00:43:52.692 --> 00:43:53.559
forty-two."
 

00:43:53.559 --> 00:43:59.702
So he's going to do exactly the
same thing as our single ticket

00:43:59.702 --> 00:44:02.079
buyers did over there.
 

00:44:02.079 --> 00:44:05.849
One guy whose utility goes from
forty-four to eighty-four to

00:44:05.849 --> 00:44:08.469
one-twenty is going to behave
exactly--

00:44:08.469 --> 00:44:12.061
provided he's got enough money
to afford to buy at these going

00:44:12.061 --> 00:44:14.619
prices--
his behavior will be exactly

00:44:14.619 --> 00:44:18.489
the same as the three separate
individuals over there.

00:44:18.489 --> 00:44:22.809
So in fact the marginal
revolution--

00:44:22.809 --> 00:44:30.695
so Jevons, Menger,
and Walras in 1871 all came up

00:44:30.695 --> 00:44:41.210
with the idea at the same time
of diminishing margin utility,

00:44:41.210 --> 00:44:44.385
and they said if you have
people who consume multiple

00:44:44.385 --> 00:44:48.050
amounts of every commodity but
they have diminishing marginal

00:44:48.050 --> 00:44:51.777
utility they're going to behave
very much the same way as this

00:44:51.777 --> 00:44:53.059
little example.
 

00:44:53.059 --> 00:44:56.088
So this little example,
in fact, is going to be

00:44:56.088 --> 00:44:57.670
extremely instructive.
 

00:44:57.670 --> 00:45:00.614
In fact it contains all the
kernels of truth of a more

00:45:00.614 --> 00:45:03.670
general model where people
consume huge amounts of every

00:45:03.670 --> 00:45:04.170
good.
 

00:45:04.170 --> 00:45:08.750
Just that they have diminishing
marginal utility.

00:45:08.750 --> 00:45:15.217
So I'm going to now describe a
slightly more complicated--so

00:45:15.217 --> 00:45:20.920
I'm going to describe this more
complicated model.

00:45:20.920 --> 00:45:25.090
So what's the way of building a
much more general,

00:45:25.090 --> 00:45:29.327
but hopefully still very simple
abstract model of general

00:45:29.327 --> 00:45:33.717
equilibrium that will capture
and generalize the example we

00:45:33.717 --> 00:45:34.929
already had?
 

00:45:34.929 --> 00:45:41.110
Well, the idea is to start with
the exogenous variables--

00:45:41.110 --> 00:45:43.650
this isn't going to move so I
don't want to do that--

00:45:43.650 --> 00:45:56.507
do this--the exogenous
variables are going to be the

00:45:56.507 --> 00:46:00.425
people,
so I'll have individuals,

00:46:00.425 --> 00:46:02.659
i in I, so let's call them
individuals.

00:46:02.659 --> 00:46:09.469
So you see why I use the word I.
 

00:46:09.469 --> 00:46:17.016
i in I, and what is it that
characterizes every individual,

00:46:17.016 --> 00:46:19.750
a utility function.
 

00:46:19.750 --> 00:46:27.731
So each individual is
characterized by a utility and

00:46:27.731 --> 00:46:30.079
an endowment.
 

00:46:30.079 --> 00:46:35.382
So to start with let's say--so
the individuals and we'll call

00:46:35.382 --> 00:46:38.829
the individuals and the goods c
in C.

00:46:38.829 --> 00:46:44.260
So let's just say there are two
goods X and Y.

00:46:44.260 --> 00:46:48.456
So an individual's going to be
characterized by utility

00:46:48.456 --> 00:46:53.458
function,
it's a welfare function of X

00:46:53.458 --> 00:47:01.739
and Y equals u_i of X
plus v_i of Y.

00:47:01.739 --> 00:47:05.076
And an endowment,
E_i equals

00:47:05.076 --> 00:47:08.952
E_i of X and
E_i of Y or

00:47:08.952 --> 00:47:12.289
(E_iX,
E_iY).

00:47:12.289 --> 00:47:16.248
So for example you could have,
I don't know,

00:47:16.248 --> 00:47:20.206
you could have,
this could be--so let's just

00:47:20.206 --> 00:47:22.139
think about this.
 

00:47:22.139 --> 00:47:25.469
So this is exactly the kind of
situation we had before.

00:47:25.469 --> 00:47:27.699
We had precisely this going on
before.

00:47:27.699 --> 00:47:28.969
What was the endowment?
 

00:47:28.969 --> 00:47:31.820
Every person began with money.
 

00:47:31.820 --> 00:47:41.010
It could have been money before
and with football tickets.

00:47:41.010 --> 00:47:44.905
And we said that the story
that--so these original

00:47:44.905 --> 00:47:49.516
marginalists argued that it's
part of human nature that the

00:47:49.516 --> 00:47:54.367
more you get of something the
less and less extra advantage it

00:47:54.367 --> 00:47:55.719
brings you.
 

00:47:55.719 --> 00:47:57.280
There may be exceptions.
 

00:47:57.280 --> 00:47:59.179
Maybe you need two of something.
 

00:47:59.179 --> 00:48:02.494
You need both shoes in order
for the shoes to help,

00:48:02.494 --> 00:48:06.342
but every pair of shoes after
that was going to be less and

00:48:06.342 --> 00:48:08.000
less valuable to you.
 

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:11.500
And so beside from these small
blips that come from

00:48:11.500 --> 00:48:15.840
indivisibilities or things like
that peoples' utility increases

00:48:15.840 --> 00:48:19.480
but at a smaller and smaller
rate as they get more of

00:48:19.480 --> 00:48:20.670
everything.
 

00:48:20.670 --> 00:48:22.170
That's just human nature,
they claim.

00:48:22.170 --> 00:48:26.260
They even tried to measure
utility.

00:48:26.260 --> 00:48:28.974
So they would try and measure
the temperature of the skin and

00:48:28.974 --> 00:48:31.735
things like that and see how it
increased when you gave people

00:48:31.735 --> 00:48:34.315
more of something and whether
the rate of increase and how

00:48:34.315 --> 00:48:37.166
much they smiled and stuff like
that whether that would actually

00:48:37.166 --> 00:48:39.744
change in a lesser and lesser
way as you add more and more

00:48:39.744 --> 00:48:40.559
utility.
 

00:48:40.559 --> 00:48:42.670
Well, they abandoned that sort
of thing eventually.

00:48:42.670 --> 00:48:45.949
But anyway, they kept the idea
of diminishing marginal utility.

00:48:45.949 --> 00:48:50.483
So we want to keep the idea
that u_i of X and

00:48:50.483 --> 00:48:55.099
v_i of Y show
diminishing marginal utility.

00:48:55.099 --> 00:48:58.150
So the way of saying that,
I told you this is one of the--

00:48:58.150 --> 00:49:01.809
so the first handout in the
reading list was review of

00:49:01.809 --> 00:49:05.820
mathematics you should know,
or if you don't know you have

00:49:05.820 --> 00:49:07.623
to learn,
diminishing marginal utility

00:49:07.623 --> 00:49:09.110
means something that looks like
that.

00:49:09.110 --> 00:49:10.449
It's a concave function.
 

00:49:10.449 --> 00:49:11.849
So here's X.
 

00:49:11.849 --> 00:49:15.114
Here's utility,
and here's u_i of X,

00:49:15.114 --> 00:49:15.550
say.
 

00:49:15.550 --> 00:49:19.550
It goes up as you get more X,
but at a rate that declines.

00:49:19.550 --> 00:49:21.619
So the slope is getting smaller
and smaller.

00:49:21.619 --> 00:49:23.739
That's diminishing marginal
utility.

00:49:23.739 --> 00:49:26.251
So this curve that's
increasing, but a lesser and

00:49:26.251 --> 00:49:29.494
lesser rate we can approximate
with a continuous differentiable

00:49:29.494 --> 00:49:32.820
curve that looks like that,
so it doesn't have the kinks

00:49:32.820 --> 00:49:36.181
here, and that's exactly the
kind of assumption that seems

00:49:36.181 --> 00:49:39.679
reasonable to fit the facts,
and at least for consumption.

00:49:39.679 --> 00:49:41.692
Our main interest,
of course, is at the bottom

00:49:41.692 --> 00:49:44.197
here in financial equilibrium,
but we have to know what's

00:49:44.197 --> 00:49:45.449
going on in the economy.
 

00:49:45.449 --> 00:49:49.606
All these finance professors,
as I said in business schools,

00:49:49.606 --> 00:49:51.719
they ignored the part above.
 

00:49:51.719 --> 00:49:54.110
They started right away with
the assets and the bonds.

00:49:54.110 --> 00:49:57.141
Said they didn't need to pay
any attention to what was going

00:49:57.141 --> 00:49:59.661
on in the economy,
because everything was going to

00:49:59.661 --> 00:50:00.329
be great.
 

00:50:00.329 --> 00:50:02.728
But we're going to find that
there's a big interaction

00:50:02.728 --> 00:50:05.219
between the financial sector and
the economic sector.

00:50:05.219 --> 00:50:07.974
That's going to be the heart of
what we're doing even though it

00:50:07.974 --> 00:50:09.840
was ignored in finance most of
the time.

00:50:09.840 --> 00:50:16.465
So anyway, diminishing marginal
utility for both of these,

00:50:16.465 --> 00:50:23.090
so for instance we could have a
hundred X minus one half X

00:50:23.090 --> 00:50:25.300
squared plus Y.
 

00:50:25.300 --> 00:50:32.989
That's one example of a utility
function.

00:50:32.989 --> 00:50:35.672
So that's going to be a
standard kind of utility

00:50:35.672 --> 00:50:36.300
function.
 

00:50:36.300 --> 00:50:40.806
So the only two ones I'm ever
going to use are things like

00:50:40.806 --> 00:50:44.679
this, or one-third log X plus
two-thirds log Y.

00:50:44.679 --> 00:50:54.619
Whenever I write log I mean
natural log.

00:50:54.619 --> 00:50:57.190
This is linear quadratic.
 

00:50:57.190 --> 00:51:02.898
So this is quadratic,
in fact linear quadratic,

00:51:02.898 --> 00:51:08.233
so maybe both will be
quadratic, and this is

00:51:08.233 --> 00:51:10.219
logarithmic.
 

00:51:10.219 --> 00:51:13.530
Now both of these have this
property of diminishing marginal

00:51:13.530 --> 00:51:16.280
utility because I can take
derivative of this,

00:51:16.280 --> 00:51:22.588
the derivative of one hundred X
minus one half X squared so the

00:51:22.588 --> 00:51:28.389
marginal utility of X is equal
to one hundred minus X,

00:51:28.389 --> 00:51:30.820
and that obviously declines.
 

00:51:30.820 --> 00:51:32.849
So it's diminishing marginal
utility.

00:51:32.849 --> 00:51:37.090
And then the derivative
here--the marginal utility with

00:51:37.090 --> 00:51:39.840
respect to X depends on X
again--

00:51:39.840 --> 00:51:43.668
is going to be one-third times
one over X because the

00:51:43.668 --> 00:51:46.539
derivative of the log is one
over X,

00:51:46.539 --> 00:51:49.539
and as X gets bigger that also
declines.

00:51:49.539 --> 00:51:52.255
So these are the two functions
that we're going to use over and

00:51:52.255 --> 00:51:54.884
over again because I want to
make things concrete with actual

00:51:54.884 --> 00:51:55.409
numbers.
 

00:51:55.409 --> 00:51:58.202
So we'll always solve examples
with quadratic stuff,

00:51:58.202 --> 00:52:00.612
maybe everything will be
quadratic or linear,

00:52:00.612 --> 00:52:02.309
and with logarithmic stuff.
 

00:52:02.309 --> 00:52:04.681
Those are the only two
functions you really have to be

00:52:04.681 --> 00:52:05.889
totally comfortable with.
 

00:52:05.889 --> 00:52:07.710
So you have to understand what
a derivative is.

00:52:07.710 --> 00:52:09.460
This is a partial derivative.
 

00:52:09.460 --> 00:52:12.829
So how much extra utility do
you get out of consuming more X?

00:52:12.829 --> 00:52:16.382
If you've already got a certain
amount of X in your possession

00:52:16.382 --> 00:52:17.840
it's a hundred minus X.
 

00:52:17.840 --> 00:52:20.900
How much more utility do you
get out of consuming more X?

00:52:20.900 --> 00:52:25.088
If this is your utility when
you're consumption's already a

00:52:25.088 --> 00:52:28.989
certain amount of X it's
one-third times one over X.

00:52:28.989 --> 00:52:33.067
So those are the two things you
have to be comfortable with

00:52:33.067 --> 00:52:33.630
using.
 

00:52:33.630 --> 00:52:36.550
So that's utility.
 

00:52:36.550 --> 00:52:39.130
What else do we need to
describe a person?

00:52:39.130 --> 00:52:42.268
It's his endowment.
 

00:52:42.268 --> 00:52:48.132
So with only two goods,
so here's X and here's Y,

00:52:48.132 --> 00:52:53.507
so we could have an endowment
E_iX,

00:52:53.507 --> 00:52:55.829
E_iY.
 

00:52:55.829 --> 00:53:01.938
That's the endowment of X and Y
of a certain person,

00:53:01.938 --> 00:53:06.250
E_iX and
E_iY.

00:53:06.250 --> 00:53:08.929
So this person,
let's say it's this top guy--

00:53:08.929 --> 00:53:11.000
a hundred X minus one over two
X squared plus Y--

00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:13.746
he has a certain utility
function, he's got a certain

00:53:13.746 --> 00:53:14.380
endowment.
 

00:53:14.380 --> 00:53:17.574
Maybe there's somebody else
over here who I can put in a

00:53:17.574 --> 00:53:18.619
different color.
 

00:53:18.619 --> 00:53:24.659
Aha, I think pink is a good
color.

00:53:24.659 --> 00:53:35.527
So another person might be over
here and this is E_jY

00:53:35.527 --> 00:53:39.210
and E_iX.
 

00:53:39.210 --> 00:53:42.659
So J has a lot more of Y,
and I has a lot more of X.

00:53:42.659 --> 00:53:45.099
They're two different people,
but you could imagine not two

00:53:45.099 --> 00:53:47.623
people you could imagine 150 of
you with different endowments

00:53:47.623 --> 00:53:50.538
and different utility functions,
or 300 million of you with

00:53:50.538 --> 00:53:53.360
different endowments and
different utility functions.

00:53:53.360 --> 00:53:56.820
And what general equilibrium is
about is saying,

00:53:56.820 --> 00:53:59.771
well, if you've got all these
people with well defined utility

00:53:59.771 --> 00:54:01.148
functions,
those are the data,

00:54:01.148 --> 00:54:03.438
we may not know them but they
know them themselves with all

00:54:03.438 --> 00:54:05.530
those utility functions and all
those endowments,

00:54:05.530 --> 00:54:08.809
and you throw 300 million of
them together,

00:54:08.809 --> 00:54:12.556
or 150 of you together,
can you predict what's going to

00:54:12.556 --> 00:54:16.719
happen and is the thing that
happens good for the society.

00:54:16.719 --> 00:54:19.139
So that's the problem of
general equilibrium.

00:54:19.139 --> 00:54:23.556
And it turns out that with
these simple utility functions

00:54:23.556 --> 00:54:26.949
it's very easy to solve for
equilibrium,

00:54:26.949 --> 00:54:29.974
predict what'll happen,
and things look great until you

00:54:29.974 --> 00:54:31.710
get to financial equilibrium.
 

00:54:31.710 --> 00:54:35.639
And we'll be able to solve them
either by hand or on a computer,

00:54:35.639 --> 00:54:37.684
and we're going to take
advantage of that because we

00:54:37.684 --> 00:54:39.530
want concrete answers to
concrete problems,

00:54:39.530 --> 00:54:44.050
and we want to interact it with
the financial world to see what

00:54:44.050 --> 00:54:44.780
happens.
 

00:54:44.780 --> 00:54:49.719
So remember,
what's the next step?

00:54:49.719 --> 00:54:52.110
The first step is exogenous
variables.

00:54:52.110 --> 00:54:54.250
So we define the exogenous
variables.

00:54:54.250 --> 00:54:56.768
The next step is endogenous
variables.

00:54:56.768 --> 00:55:03.969
So what are the endogenous
variables going to be?

00:55:03.969 --> 00:55:11.152
And the endogenous variables
are going to be the prices and

00:55:11.152 --> 00:55:15.610
the trades, or final
consumptions.

00:55:15.610 --> 00:55:20.315
You can always deduce a trade
from a final consumption because

00:55:20.315 --> 00:55:23.532
if you know your endowment,
the exogenous thing,

00:55:23.532 --> 00:55:26.152
and you're consuming more of X
than you're endowed with you

00:55:26.152 --> 00:55:28.230
must have bought that difference
somewhere.

00:55:28.230 --> 00:55:32.364
And if you're consuming less Y
than you started with you must

00:55:32.364 --> 00:55:36.570
have sold some of that Y in
order to end up consuming less.

00:55:36.570 --> 00:55:39.840
So the endogenous variables are
the prices and the trades.

00:55:39.840 --> 00:55:44.494
Now, how can we make a general
theory that for an arbitrary

00:55:44.494 --> 00:55:47.800
number of people,
an arbitrary number of goods,

00:55:47.800 --> 00:55:51.027
you can solve and figure out
what's going to happen that

00:55:51.027 --> 00:55:54.605
looks very much like the example
and has as a special case the

00:55:54.605 --> 00:55:56.599
example we did to begin with?
 

00:55:56.599 --> 00:55:59.251
That's what happened with
general equilibrium,

00:55:59.251 --> 00:56:01.079
and I'm about to describe it.
 

00:56:01.079 --> 00:56:09.556
So the next step is always to
write down the equilibrium as a

00:56:09.556 --> 00:56:14.360
bunch of simultaneous equations.
 

00:56:14.360 --> 00:56:17.052
So what are all the equilibrium
equations going to be,

00:56:17.052 --> 00:56:20.150
and that's what's going to be
our model of what happens in the

00:56:20.150 --> 00:56:20.659
world.
 

00:56:20.659 --> 00:56:23.019
Are there any questions?
 

00:56:23.019 --> 00:56:24.070
How are you all doing here?
 

00:56:24.070 --> 00:56:28.130
Is this painfully repetitive of
what you know.

00:56:28.130 --> 00:56:29.929
I need some feedback here.
 

00:56:29.929 --> 00:56:33.280
How many of you haven't seen
this before?

00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:35.340
Everybody's seen this before?
 

00:56:35.340 --> 00:56:38.610
What about all these people who
e-mailed me and said they were

00:56:38.610 --> 00:56:41.989
scientists and philosophers and
psychologists and they wanted to

00:56:41.989 --> 00:56:43.760
take economics the first day.
 

00:56:43.760 --> 00:56:45.059
So you're one of those people.
 

00:56:45.059 --> 00:56:45.860
Maybe you didn't e-mail me.
 

00:56:45.860 --> 00:56:49.271
So this is a first for you,
but everybody else you've all

00:56:49.271 --> 00:56:50.429
seen this before.
 

00:56:50.429 --> 00:56:53.280
Well, that's good.
 

00:56:53.280 --> 00:56:54.239
I can move along here.
 

00:56:54.239 --> 00:57:00.150
So I'll keep looking at you as
I proceed here.

00:57:00.150 --> 00:57:03.079
So don't feel bashful.
 

00:57:03.079 --> 00:57:05.500
Speak up if it's not making
sense.

00:57:05.500 --> 00:57:09.980
So what was the great
conceptual advance?

00:57:09.980 --> 00:57:13.880
It was--one conceptual advance
was the budget set.

00:57:13.880 --> 00:57:17.630
Now, this will turn out to be,
in economics--

00:57:17.630 --> 00:57:21.429
the rest of the 140 of them
have all got this down,

00:57:21.429 --> 00:57:24.117
but as soon as we turn it into
a financial problem they're not

00:57:24.117 --> 00:57:26.893
going to be able to do it again
even though it's going to be the

00:57:26.893 --> 00:57:27.510
same idea.
 

00:57:27.510 --> 00:57:31.264
So this budget set was an
extremely clever idea which I'll

00:57:31.264 --> 00:57:34.889
now repeat for them and tell you
for the first time,

00:57:34.889 --> 00:57:37.789
but I can almost guarantee that
although they all think it's

00:57:37.789 --> 00:57:39.592
obvious,
when we do the first financial

00:57:39.592 --> 00:57:42.161
problem they aren't going to be
able to do it even though it's

00:57:42.161 --> 00:57:43.130
the exact same idea.
 

00:57:43.130 --> 00:57:44.329
So what's the idea?
 

00:57:44.329 --> 00:57:46.795
You begin with your endowment,
E_iX and

00:57:46.795 --> 00:57:47.670
E_iy.
 

00:57:47.670 --> 00:57:51.309
So this person has to buy and
sell X and Y.

00:57:51.309 --> 00:57:54.753
So the person says to himself,
"I've started with this X

00:57:54.753 --> 00:57:57.739
and Y, I might like something
that's better."

00:57:57.739 --> 00:58:02.170
Now how can you illustrate
what's better for this person?

00:58:02.170 --> 00:58:06.612
Well, Edgeworth,
as I mentioned,

00:58:06.612 --> 00:58:14.639
Edgeworth invented the idea of
the indifference curve.

00:58:14.639 --> 00:58:18.637
So he says, "All the goods
that are of the same utility can

00:58:18.637 --> 00:58:21.809
be described by this
indifference curve X."

00:58:21.809 --> 00:58:25.532
This person,
her utility is one-third log X

00:58:25.532 --> 00:58:30.164
plus two-thirds log Y,
well if she consumes less of X,

00:58:30.164 --> 00:58:34.606
enough extra Y will make her
just indifferent to where she

00:58:34.606 --> 00:58:39.050
was before because there's a
tradeoff between X and Y.

00:58:39.050 --> 00:58:40.559
Economics is all about
tradeoffs.

00:58:40.559 --> 00:58:42.159
So this is her indifference
curve.

00:58:42.159 --> 00:58:45.469
Maybe his indifference curve
looks like that,

00:58:45.469 --> 00:58:48.480
a different slope,
entirely different.

00:58:48.480 --> 00:58:52.230
So he thinks a lot of Y.
 

00:58:52.230 --> 00:58:54.686
A little diminution in Y you
better get a lot of X to

00:58:54.686 --> 00:58:55.489
compensate him.
 

00:58:55.489 --> 00:58:58.005
She's kind of more balanced in
things, X and Y,

00:58:58.005 --> 00:59:01.068
unless she starts to get too
much of X in which case Y is

00:59:01.068 --> 00:59:02.489
more important to her.
 

00:59:02.489 --> 00:59:04.409
She in general is more balanced
than he is.

00:59:04.409 --> 00:59:06.061
But anyway, so they have
different tastes,

00:59:06.061 --> 00:59:08.320
different utility functions,
and different endowments.

00:59:08.320 --> 00:59:10.018
So what's going to happen in
the end?

00:59:10.018 --> 00:59:12.730
Well, the budget set describes
what she can do.

00:59:12.730 --> 00:59:14.719
We're going to assume,
as we did before,

00:59:14.719 --> 00:59:18.190
that cornerstone of economic
reasoning,

00:59:18.190 --> 00:59:20.099
somehow when these hundred
million people,

00:59:20.099 --> 00:59:23.521
300 million people get together
they're going to miraculously

00:59:23.521 --> 00:59:24.719
discover the price.
 

00:59:24.719 --> 00:59:26.114
They're going to be screaming
at each other,

00:59:26.114 --> 00:59:27.119
but we don't care about that.
 

00:59:27.119 --> 00:59:30.266
We just say for the purpose of
the big picture,

00:59:30.266 --> 00:59:33.210
some price of X and Y is going
to emerge.

00:59:33.210 --> 00:59:36.849
So equilibrium is going to be a
price of X and a price of Y.

00:59:36.849 --> 00:59:40.449
It's going to emerge and now
what can she do?

00:59:40.449 --> 00:59:45.318
Well, she can say,
"Given my X I can buy more

00:59:45.318 --> 00:59:50.585
X than I started with,
and if I do that the price of X

00:59:50.585 --> 00:59:53.268
is P_X."
 

00:59:53.268 --> 00:59:56.420
So if I want to buy more--I
have this already.

00:59:56.420 --> 00:59:58.809
So I want to end up consuming
X_i,

00:59:58.809 --> 01:00:02.280
so final consumptions will be
X_i and Y_i,

01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:06.730
this is the final consumption,
so my trade,

01:00:06.730 --> 01:00:09.556
if I want to buy more,
I can express the idea that I'm

01:00:09.556 --> 01:00:12.702
buying more by saying my final
consumption is bigger than my

01:00:12.702 --> 01:00:13.449
endowment.
 

01:00:13.449 --> 01:00:16.286
So I've had to buy,
I've had to trade to get this

01:00:16.286 --> 01:00:19.713
much more which means I had to
pay P_X times this

01:00:19.713 --> 01:00:20.599
difference.
 

01:00:20.599 --> 01:00:23.730
Now, how did I get the money
for that?

01:00:23.730 --> 01:00:28.329
Well, I got the money for that
by selling some of Y.

01:00:28.329 --> 01:00:30.170
So I sold Y.
 

01:00:30.170 --> 01:00:35.101
I started with E_iY
and I sold some of it because I

01:00:35.101 --> 01:00:38.059
ended up with less than I
started.

01:00:38.059 --> 01:00:42.420
So the money I got by selling Y
I can use to spend on buying X.

01:00:42.420 --> 01:00:43.929
That's the basic budget
constraint.

01:00:43.929 --> 01:00:46.518
Now, the cleverness is in
realizing that it doesn't matter

01:00:46.518 --> 01:00:49.469
which one--So here X_i
is bigger than E_iX.

01:00:49.469 --> 01:00:50.840
You're buying X.
 

01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:52.349
Here Y_i is less than
E_iY.

01:00:52.349 --> 01:00:54.079
You're selling Y.
 

01:00:54.079 --> 01:00:57.420
And so the revenue you get from
selling Y equals the expenditure

01:00:57.420 --> 01:00:58.639
you make on buying X.
 

01:00:58.639 --> 01:01:01.351
So the cleverness is in
realizing it doesn't matter what

01:01:01.351 --> 01:01:02.139
the signs are.
 

01:01:02.139 --> 01:01:05.632
If X_i is less than
E_iX this equation

01:01:05.632 --> 01:01:09.250
still makes sense because then
you get a negative number.

01:01:09.250 --> 01:01:11.804
You've gotten money by
consuming less X than you

01:01:11.804 --> 01:01:14.630
started with so that's money you
can use to buy Y.

01:01:14.630 --> 01:01:18.842
And then Y_i--you'll
be able to buy more Y than you

01:01:18.842 --> 01:01:23.054
started with so this number will
also be negative by the same

01:01:23.054 --> 01:01:24.389
amount as this.
 

01:01:24.389 --> 01:01:25.909
This is the extra value on Y.
 

01:01:25.909 --> 01:01:27.340
This is the extra value on X.
 

01:01:27.340 --> 01:01:31.021
So whether the X's and the Y's
are bigger or smaller than the

01:01:31.021 --> 01:01:34.030
E_iX's or
E_iY's this equation

01:01:34.030 --> 01:01:37.590
defines the budget trading
opportunities of the agent.

01:01:37.590 --> 01:01:39.880
Did that go too fast?
 

01:01:39.880 --> 01:01:40.989
You got that.
 

01:01:40.989 --> 01:01:44.445
So you can write that a little
bit more simply by saying,

01:01:44.445 --> 01:01:47.099
putting a plus here and
reversing the order,

01:01:47.099 --> 01:01:48.889
making it more symmetric.
 

01:01:48.889 --> 01:01:53.300
So this is Y_i minus
E_iY equals zero.

01:01:53.300 --> 01:02:01.179
So that's the budget set of
agent i.

01:02:01.179 --> 01:02:06.018
And in the diagram the budget
set--I'm out of colors that show

01:02:06.018 --> 01:02:09.869
up I think--
all the others got vetoed,

01:02:09.869 --> 01:02:14.092
I think orange was okay--
the budget set,

01:02:14.092 --> 01:02:18.639
then, will be something that
looks like this.

01:02:18.639 --> 01:02:21.590
That looks terrible.
 

01:02:21.590 --> 01:02:25.110
How bad can you get?
 

01:02:25.110 --> 01:02:31.498
So that budget set might look
something like--let's make it

01:02:31.498 --> 01:02:32.710
this way.
 

01:02:32.710 --> 01:02:33.840
It looks something like that.
 

01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:38.505
It's a linear line that goes
up--just forget this guy's

01:02:38.505 --> 01:02:39.630
budget set.
 

01:02:39.630 --> 01:02:40.460
We'll do the other one.
 

01:02:40.460 --> 01:02:41.630
I can get it better in the
picture.

01:02:41.630 --> 01:02:45.032
So this one's budget set,
his budget set might look

01:02:45.032 --> 01:02:46.530
something like that.
 

01:02:46.530 --> 01:02:48.744
So his budget set,
never mind hers,

01:02:48.744 --> 01:02:52.001
it goes off the page,
his budget set he starts with

01:02:52.001 --> 01:02:53.239
this endowment.
 

01:02:53.239 --> 01:02:56.719
If the prices are given
P_X and P_Y,

01:02:56.719 --> 01:03:00.074
P_X and P_Y
define a linear tradeoff between

01:03:00.074 --> 01:03:02.894
X_i and Y_i,
in this case j,

01:03:02.894 --> 01:03:06.719
because the more X you consume
the less Y you have to consume

01:03:06.719 --> 01:03:10.670
and there's going to be a linear
tradeoff between the two given

01:03:10.670 --> 01:03:12.710
by rearranging these terms.
 

01:03:12.710 --> 01:03:15.389
P_X and P_Y
are fixed,

01:03:15.389 --> 01:03:17.304
so this is just a linear
equation in X_i and

01:03:17.304 --> 01:03:19.806
Y_i,
and so that tradeoff is given

01:03:19.806 --> 01:03:21.110
by that budget set.
 

01:03:21.110 --> 01:03:25.757
So mister pink is going to try,
given his opportunities on this

01:03:25.757 --> 01:03:29.655
budget set, to pick the
combination of X and Y that's

01:03:29.655 --> 01:03:30.929
best for him.
 

01:03:30.929 --> 01:03:34.797
And so that's going to turn out
to be something that's right

01:03:34.797 --> 01:03:38.271
here because no other
combination of X and Y will give

01:03:38.271 --> 01:03:40.369
him as much utility as that.
 

01:03:40.369 --> 01:03:42.610
Did that make sense?
 

01:03:42.610 --> 01:03:44.039
All right, so that's it.
 

01:03:44.039 --> 01:03:46.349
That's the main lesson.
 

01:03:46.349 --> 01:03:50.929
So how do you describe now the
whole equilibrium conditions?

01:03:50.929 --> 01:03:56.398
Well, so equilibrium now,
if you can see this,

01:03:56.398 --> 01:04:00.409
equilibrium is defined by what?
 

01:04:00.409 --> 01:04:06.356
It's defined by P_X,
P_Y,

01:04:06.356 --> 01:04:13.518
and X_i and
Y_i for all i in I.

01:04:13.518 --> 01:04:16.981
It's just the prices that
emerge and final consumptions

01:04:16.981 --> 01:04:19.289
that everybody chooses of X and
Y.

01:04:19.289 --> 01:04:21.010
There are only two goods here.
 

01:04:21.010 --> 01:04:23.844
So the price of X,
the price of Y what every

01:04:23.844 --> 01:04:27.340
person i ends up with
X_i and Y_i,

01:04:27.340 --> 01:04:29.449
and what has to be the case?
 

01:04:29.449 --> 01:04:30.260
What has to be the case?
 

01:04:30.260 --> 01:04:34.452
The first equation is going to
be that the final consumptions

01:04:34.452 --> 01:04:38.226
of everybody have to equal the
final endowments because

01:04:38.226 --> 01:04:42.000
everyone who buys has to be met
by another seller.

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:45.510
Remember equilibrium was price
taking, agent optimization,

01:04:45.510 --> 01:04:48.219
rational expectations and
market clearing.

01:04:48.219 --> 01:04:50.923
Price taking means everybody
knows what the prices are,

01:04:50.923 --> 01:04:53.128
miraculously P_X and
P_Y,

01:04:53.128 --> 01:04:54.130
before they act.
 

01:04:54.130 --> 01:04:56.489
Agent optimization we're going
to come to.

01:04:56.489 --> 01:04:59.130
It means they do the best thing
they can.

01:04:59.130 --> 01:05:01.722
Rational expectations means
even though they're only buying

01:05:01.722 --> 01:05:04.494
one good and there are thousands
in the economy they understand

01:05:04.494 --> 01:05:06.632
all the prices,
and when they act they're

01:05:06.632 --> 01:05:09.518
taking into account all of the
tradeoffs they could make.

01:05:09.518 --> 01:05:11.329
So they realize the whole
vector of prices.

01:05:11.329 --> 01:05:14.750
And market clearing means for
any buyer there's a seller,

01:05:14.750 --> 01:05:19.005
so market clearing means
summation from i in I of

01:05:19.005 --> 01:05:23.349
X_i has to equal
summation i in I of the

01:05:23.349 --> 01:05:26.449
endowment,
E_iX of X.

01:05:26.449 --> 01:05:32.449
So in this picture if I added
this to this,

01:05:32.449 --> 01:05:36.644
this is the endowment,
so I add this vector to that

01:05:36.644 --> 01:05:39.750
vector I get this thing over
here,

01:05:39.750 --> 01:05:50.619
and this is going to be the
total endowment in the economy.

01:05:50.619 --> 01:05:52.842
So this total endowment
E_iX,

01:05:52.842 --> 01:05:56.119
I add over every person i what
the total endowment is.

01:05:56.119 --> 01:05:59.182
So I add his endowment of X to
this guy's endowment of X and I

01:05:59.182 --> 01:06:00.739
get the total endowment of X.
 

01:06:00.739 --> 01:06:05.574
I add her endowment of Y to his
endowment of Y and I get the

01:06:05.574 --> 01:06:07.460
total endowment of Y.
 

01:06:07.460 --> 01:06:13.099
So the first two equations are
summation i in I.

01:06:13.099 --> 01:06:18.800
Y_i equals summation
i in I of E_iY.

01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:23.186
The third equation is everybody
is going to choose on their

01:06:23.186 --> 01:06:24.170
budget set.
 

01:06:24.170 --> 01:06:26.860
Everyone, this person--mister
pink here--

01:06:26.860 --> 01:06:30.360
he's going to choose not inside
his budget set,

01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:33.860
he can't choose outside of it
because there's no point in

01:06:33.860 --> 01:06:34.860
wasting money.
 

01:06:34.860 --> 01:06:37.581
He's going to buy the
combination of X and Y that lies

01:06:37.581 --> 01:06:40.510
on his budget set that does as
well as he possibly can.

01:06:40.510 --> 01:06:46.405
So the equation here is going
to be that P_X times

01:06:46.405 --> 01:06:50.204
X_i minus
E_iX plus

01:06:50.204 --> 01:06:54.001
P_Y times
Y_i minus

01:06:54.001 --> 01:06:57.800
E_iY is equal to zero.
 

01:06:57.800 --> 01:07:01.117
I could do this for j too just
since I've got a picture

01:07:01.117 --> 01:07:04.250
of--this is P_X,
this is P_Y.

01:07:04.250 --> 01:07:07.079
P_X times
X_j minus

01:07:07.079 --> 01:07:09.704
E_jX,
so I'm doing a special case now

01:07:09.704 --> 01:07:14.161
with two people,
Y_j minus

01:07:14.161 --> 01:07:19.630
E_jX equals zero.
 

01:07:19.630 --> 01:07:21.989
Everybody's on their budget set.
 

01:07:21.989 --> 01:07:27.472
So he's on his budget set,
she's going to be on her budget

01:07:27.472 --> 01:07:28.050
set.
 

01:07:28.050 --> 01:07:30.737
Her budget set,
by the way, is better than his

01:07:30.737 --> 01:07:33.661
because her budget set is going
to look like this,

01:07:33.661 --> 01:07:34.260
right?
 

01:07:34.260 --> 01:07:37.452
It's got to be parallel to his
because the prices she faces are

01:07:37.452 --> 01:07:40.130
the same and her endowment is
worth more than his.

01:07:40.130 --> 01:07:43.849
So her budget set is further
out.

01:07:43.849 --> 01:07:46.132
So that's what he does,
that's what she does,

01:07:46.132 --> 01:07:48.570
or that's what she does,
that's what he does.

01:07:48.570 --> 01:07:52.277
And now the fifth one--so now
we have the two mysterious

01:07:52.277 --> 01:07:54.030
equations that are left.
 

01:07:54.030 --> 01:07:58.478
So how do we express the idea
that the choices X_i

01:07:58.478 --> 01:08:04.039
and Y_i by i,
that's her--and she's going to

01:08:04.039 --> 01:08:08.480
optimize by choosing here
somewhere.

01:08:08.480 --> 01:08:10.559
This is her indifference curve,
right, looked like that.

01:08:10.559 --> 01:08:12.239
So that's what she's going to
do.

01:08:12.239 --> 01:08:15.650
And remember he's going to
choose here.

01:08:15.650 --> 01:08:20.680
So how can you turn her choice
and his choice into an equation?

01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:27.182
Well, this was invented by a
German guy Gossen in 1851 and

01:08:27.182 --> 01:08:32.345
then rediscovered by Jevons,
Menger and Walras,

01:08:32.345 --> 01:08:36.500
the same three I mentioned
several times now.

01:08:36.500 --> 01:08:38.658
This is the marginal revolution
in economics.

01:08:38.658 --> 01:08:43.430
What they said is you can turn
the behavior of individuals,

01:08:43.430 --> 01:08:46.533
of humans as Gossen said,
"I can do for the bodies

01:08:46.533 --> 01:08:49.810
on earth what Copernicus did for
the bodies in heaven,

01:08:49.810 --> 01:08:52.689
find equations that describe
their motion."

01:08:52.689 --> 01:08:54.520
What is it that people are
going to do?

01:08:54.520 --> 01:08:57.621
To say that you're choosing the
best possible thing means that

01:08:57.621 --> 01:09:00.469
the slope of the budget set is
equal to the slope of your

01:09:00.469 --> 01:09:02.730
indifference curve,
but what is the slope of your

01:09:02.730 --> 01:09:03.448
indifference curve?
 

01:09:03.448 --> 01:09:05.779
That's the tradeoff between X
and Y.

01:09:05.779 --> 01:09:07.770
So what does it mean?
 

01:09:07.770 --> 01:09:13.157
If you get a little bit less X
you're losing the marginal

01:09:13.157 --> 01:09:14.600
utility of X.
 

01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:17.863
If you get a little bit more of
Y you're gaining the marginal

01:09:17.863 --> 01:09:18.680
utility of Y.
 

01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:22.230
If the price of X and Y are the
same then it had better be that

01:09:22.230 --> 01:09:25.667
the marginal utility of X is
equal to the marginal utility of

01:09:25.667 --> 01:09:29.219
Y because you can always give up
one unit of X and get one unit

01:09:29.219 --> 01:09:29.850
of Y.
 

01:09:29.850 --> 01:09:32.884
If this is optimal,
and you can give up one unit of

01:09:32.884 --> 01:09:35.823
X and get two units--
sorry, if the marginal utility

01:09:35.823 --> 01:09:38.909
of Y was double the marginal
utility of X then you would give

01:09:38.909 --> 01:09:41.997
up that one unit of X and you'd
get two extra utils by taking

01:09:41.997 --> 01:09:45.600
the one unit of Y which you can
afford by selling one unit of X,

01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:48.328
and the utility would be much
higher than it was here.

01:09:48.328 --> 01:09:52.170
And so you wouldn't be
optimizing by doing that.

01:09:52.170 --> 01:09:58.667
So the final equation is you're
optimizing if and only if the

01:09:58.667 --> 01:10:04.841
marginal utility of i of X
divided by the marginal utility

01:10:04.841 --> 01:10:10.689
of i of Y equals P_X
over P_Y.

01:10:10.689 --> 01:10:14.328
And the last equation is the
same thing for j,

01:10:14.328 --> 01:10:21.140
the marginal utility of j of X
divided by the marginal utility

01:10:21.140 --> 01:10:27.060
of Y has to equal P_X
over P_Y.

01:10:27.060 --> 01:10:27.920
So why is that again?
 

01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:29.750
That's the trickiest equation.
 

01:10:29.750 --> 01:10:34.310
That's the one that Marx and
Adam Smith and not even Ricardo,

01:10:34.310 --> 01:10:35.250
the most brilliant one of them
all,

01:10:35.250 --> 01:10:37.390
not even Ricardo could figure
that out,

01:10:37.390 --> 01:10:41.328
this equation marginal utility,
wait until 1871.

01:10:41.328 --> 01:10:44.046
And again, to repeat it,
it's of course very obvious now

01:10:44.046 --> 01:10:46.712
but wasn't at the time,
how can you describe what these

01:10:46.712 --> 01:10:47.750
people are doing?
 

01:10:47.750 --> 01:10:49.658
You have to figure out the
budget constraint,

01:10:49.658 --> 01:10:52.301
that's what they can afford,
and then they're going to

01:10:52.301 --> 01:10:55.490
choose the point on their budget
constraint which maximizes their

01:10:55.490 --> 01:10:56.090
utility.
 

01:10:56.090 --> 01:10:58.404
But that just means in the
picture it makes the

01:10:58.404 --> 01:11:00.819
indifference curve tangent to
the budget set,

01:11:00.819 --> 01:11:05.546
which means that you set--so
and what is the slope of the

01:11:05.546 --> 01:11:07.319
indifference curve?
 

01:11:07.319 --> 01:11:10.309
Well, the tradeoff between X
and Y that leaves you

01:11:10.309 --> 01:11:14.029
indifferent--how much X do you
have to give up to get an extra

01:11:14.029 --> 01:11:16.408
unit of Y and still be
indifferent?

01:11:16.408 --> 01:11:20.051
It's determined by the ratio of
the marginal utility of X to the

01:11:20.051 --> 01:11:22.770
marginal utility of Y because
those are the,

01:11:22.770 --> 01:11:24.837
you know, when you give up a
unit of X you're losing the

01:11:24.837 --> 01:11:25.738
marginal utility of X.
 

01:11:25.738 --> 01:11:28.337
When you're getting a unit of Y
you're getting the marginal

01:11:28.337 --> 01:11:29.010
utility of Y.
 

01:11:29.010 --> 01:11:33.524
If you can trade them off in
the market at 3:1 you optimize

01:11:33.524 --> 01:11:37.962
when, in your own personal
evaluation, you're trading them

01:11:37.962 --> 01:11:40.220
off on the margin at 3:1.
 

01:11:40.220 --> 01:11:41.770
You really follow that?
 

01:11:41.770 --> 01:11:45.369
That's an idea that took fifty
years to figure out and you

01:11:45.369 --> 01:11:48.149
claim you figured it out now in
five minutes,

01:11:48.149 --> 01:11:49.350
so that's good.
 

01:11:49.350 --> 01:11:54.479
So you'll have a chance in the
problem set to get practice.

01:11:54.479 --> 01:11:56.229
So those are the equations.
 

01:11:56.229 --> 01:12:00.788
We now basically have described
economic equilibrium.

01:12:00.788 --> 01:12:04.908
So we now have the ability to
play with all kinds of models,

01:12:04.908 --> 01:12:06.850
as we'll start in the next
class doing,

01:12:06.850 --> 01:12:09.787
solving for economic
equilibrium, figuring out what

01:12:09.787 --> 01:12:12.045
will happen,
and then complicating it by

01:12:12.045 --> 01:12:15.050
adding a financial sector and
see how that affects what goes

01:12:15.050 --> 01:12:16.119
on in equilibrium.
 

01:12:16.119 --> 01:12:22.000

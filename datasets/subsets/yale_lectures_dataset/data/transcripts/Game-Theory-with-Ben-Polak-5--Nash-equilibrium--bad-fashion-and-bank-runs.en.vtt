00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:04.729
Professor Ben Polak:
Okay, so last time we came

00:00:04.729 --> 00:00:07.595
across a new idea,
although it wasn't very new for

00:00:07.595 --> 00:00:13.879
a lot of you,
and that was the idea of Nash

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:17.604
Equilibrium.
What I want to do today is

00:00:17.604 --> 00:00:19.949
discuss Nash Equilibrium,
see how we find that

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.190
equilibrium into rather simple
examples.

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:24.804
And then in the second half of
the day I want to look at an

00:00:24.804 --> 00:00:27.600
application where we actually
have some fun and play a game.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.791
At least I hope it's fun.
But let's start by putting down

00:00:31.791 --> 00:00:35.343
a formal definition.
We only used a rather informal

00:00:35.343 --> 00:00:38.260
one last week,
so here's a formal one.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:44.448
A strategy profile--remember a
profile is one strategy for each

00:00:44.448 --> 00:00:48.940
player, so it's going to be
S_1*,

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.853
S_2*,
all the way up to

00:00:51.853 --> 00:00:57.042
S_M* if there are M
players playing the game--so

00:00:57.042 --> 00:01:01.868
this profile is a Nash
Equilibrium (and I'm just going

00:01:01.868 --> 00:01:07.148
to write NE in this class for
Nash Equilibrium from now on)

00:01:07.148 --> 00:01:11.727
if,
for each i â€“so for each

00:01:11.727 --> 00:01:19.129
player i, her choice--so her
choice here is S_i*,

00:01:19.129 --> 00:01:34.130
i is part of that profile is a
best response to the other

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:41.663
players' choices.
Of course, the other players'

00:01:41.663 --> 00:01:45.623
choices here are
S_--i* so everyone is

00:01:45.623 --> 00:01:49.330
playing a best response to
everyone else.

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:54.186
Now, this is by far the most
commonly used solution concept

00:01:54.186 --> 00:01:56.740
in Game Theory.
So those of you who are

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.639
interviewing for McKenzie or
something, you're going to find

00:01:59.639 --> 00:02:02.439
that they're going to expect you
to know what this is.

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:04.635
So one reason for knowing what
it is, is because it's in the

00:02:04.635 --> 00:02:06.829
textbooks, it's going to be used
in lots of applications,

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:08.520
it's going to be used in your
McKenzie interview.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.501
That's not a very good reason
and I certainly don't want you

00:02:11.501 --> 00:02:14.078
to jump to the conclusion that
now we've got to Nash

00:02:14.078 --> 00:02:17.110
Equilibrium everything we've
done up to know is in some sense

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.009
irrelevant.
That's not the case.

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:22.304
It's not always going to be the
case that people always play a

00:02:22.304 --> 00:02:23.907
Nash Equilibrium.
For example,

00:02:23.907 --> 00:02:26.648
when we played the numbers
game, the game when you chose a

00:02:26.648 --> 00:02:28.477
number,
we've already discussed last

00:02:28.477 --> 00:02:30.691
week or last time,
that the equilibrium in that

00:02:30.691 --> 00:02:32.520
game is for everyone to choose
one,

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.437
but when we actually played the
game, the average was much

00:02:35.437 --> 00:02:37.740
higher than that:
the average was about 13.

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.646
It is true that when we played
it repeatedly,

00:02:39.646 --> 00:02:41.120
it seemed to converge towards
1,

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.279
but the play of the game when
we played it just one shot first

00:02:44.279 --> 00:02:47.222
time, wasn't a Nash Equilibrium.
So we shouldn't form the

00:02:47.222 --> 00:02:50.030
mistake of thinking people
always play Nash Equilibrium or

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.789
people, "if they're rational,"
play Nash Equilibrium.

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:54.819
Neither of those statements are
true.

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:56.792
Nevertheless,
there are some good reasons for

00:02:56.792 --> 00:02:59.617
thinking about Nash Equilibrium
other than the fact it's used by

00:02:59.617 --> 00:03:02.594
other people,
and let's talk about those a

00:03:02.594 --> 00:03:05.480
bit.
So I want to put down some

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:11.034
motivations here--the first
motivation we already discussed

00:03:11.034 --> 00:03:15.004
last time.
In fact, somebody in the

00:03:15.004 --> 00:03:20.227
audience mentioned it,
and it's the idea of "no

00:03:20.227 --> 00:03:22.800
regrets."
So what is this idea?

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.720
It says, suppose we're looking
at a Nash Equilibrium.

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.715
If we hold the strategies of
everyone else fixed,

00:03:31.715 --> 00:03:36.190
no individual i has an
incentive to deviate,

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.660
to move away.
Alright, I'll say it again.

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:42.544
Holding everyone else's actions
fixed, no individual has any

00:03:42.544 --> 00:03:45.832
incentive to move away.
Let me be a little more careful

00:03:45.832 --> 00:03:47.456
here;
no individual has any

00:03:47.456 --> 00:03:49.819
strict incentive to move
away.

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:51.370
We'll see if that actually
matters.

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:58.050
So no individual can do
strictly better by moving away.

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:13.859
No individual can do strictly
better by deviating,

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:24.830
holding everyone else's
actions.

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:27.433
So why I call that "no regret"?
It means, having played the

00:04:27.433 --> 00:04:29.949
game, suppose you did in fact
play a Nash Equilibrium and then

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:31.600
you looked back at what you had
done,

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.258
and now you know what everyone
else has done and you say,

00:04:34.258 --> 00:04:36.378
"Do I regret my actions?"
And the answer is,

00:04:36.378 --> 00:04:39.172
"No, I don't regret my actions
because I did the best I could

00:04:39.172 --> 00:04:41.760
given what they did."
So that seems like a fairly

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.920
important sort of central idea
for why we should care about

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.246
Nash Equilibrium.
Here's a second idea,

00:04:47.246 --> 00:04:50.250
and we'll see others arise in
the course of today.

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:59.738
A second idea is that a Nash
Equilibrium can be thought of as

00:04:59.738 --> 00:05:05.134
self-fulfilling beliefs.
So, in the last week or so

00:05:05.134 --> 00:05:07.209
we've talked a fair amount about
beliefs.

00:05:07.209 --> 00:05:10.606
If I believe the goal keeper's
going to dive this way I should

00:05:10.606 --> 00:05:13.555
shoot that way and so on.
But of course we didn't talk

00:05:13.555 --> 00:05:16.113
about any beliefs in particular.
These beliefs,

00:05:16.113 --> 00:05:19.464
if I believe that--if everyone
in the game believes that

00:05:19.464 --> 00:05:23.181
everyone else is going to play
their part of a particular Nash

00:05:23.181 --> 00:05:26.221
Equilibrium then everyone,
will in fact,

00:05:26.221 --> 00:05:29.940
play their part of that Nash
Equilibrium.

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:33.709
Now, why?
Why is it the case if everyone

00:05:33.709 --> 00:05:36.638
believes that everyone else is
playing their part of this

00:05:36.638 --> 00:05:39.933
particular Nash Equilibrium that
that's so fulfilling and people

00:05:39.933 --> 00:05:43.980
actually will play that way?
Why is that the case?

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:48.399
Anybody?
Can we get this guy in red?

00:05:48.399 --> 00:05:50.995
Student: Because your
Nash Equilibrium matches the

00:05:50.995 --> 00:05:53.437
best response against both.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:05:53.437 --> 00:05:55.754
Exactly, so it's really--it's
almost a repeat of the first

00:05:55.754 --> 00:05:57.534
thing.
If I think everyone else is

00:05:57.534 --> 00:06:00.205
going to play their
particular--if I think players 2

00:06:00.205 --> 00:06:02.771
through N are going to play
S_2* through

00:06:02.771 --> 00:06:05.547
S_N*--then by
definition my best response is

00:06:05.547 --> 00:06:08.900
to play S_1* so I will
in fact play my part in the Nash

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:11.397
Equilibrium.
Good, so as part of the

00:06:11.397 --> 00:06:14.920
definition, we can see these are
self-fulfilling beliefs.

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:18.983
Let's just remind ourselves how
that arose in the example we

00:06:18.983 --> 00:06:22.319
looked at the end last time.
I'm not going to go back and

00:06:22.319 --> 00:06:24.360
re-analyze it,
but I just want to sort of make

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:28.405
sure that we followed it.
So, we had this picture last

00:06:28.405 --> 00:06:34.055
time in the partnership game in
which people were choosing

00:06:34.055 --> 00:06:37.724
effort levels.
And this line was the best

00:06:37.724 --> 00:06:42.149
response for Player 1 as a
function of Player 2's choice.

00:06:42.149 --> 00:06:46.445
And this line was the best
response of Player 2 as a

00:06:46.445 --> 00:06:50.363
function of Player 1's choice.
This is the picture we saw last

00:06:50.363 --> 00:06:51.884
time.
And let's just look at how

00:06:51.884 --> 00:06:54.602
those--it's no secret here what
the Nash Equilibrium is:

00:06:54.602 --> 00:06:57.567
the Nash Equilibrium is where
the lines cross--but let's just

00:06:57.567 --> 00:07:00.680
see how it maps out to those two
motivations we just said.

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:02.660
So, how about self-fulfilling
beliefs?

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:06.671
Well, if Player--sorry,
I put 1, that should be 2--if

00:07:06.671 --> 00:07:10.837
Player 1 believes that Player 2
is going to choose this

00:07:10.837 --> 00:07:13.730
strategy,
then Player 1 should choose

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:16.082
this strategy.
If Player 1 thinks Player 2

00:07:16.082 --> 00:07:18.639
should take this strategy,
then Player 1 should choose

00:07:18.639 --> 00:07:20.603
this strategy.
If Player 1 thinks Player 2 is

00:07:20.603 --> 00:07:22.510
choosing this strategy,
then Player I should choose

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:24.772
this strategy and so on;
that's what it means to be best

00:07:24.772 --> 00:07:28.162
response.
But if Player 1 thinks that

00:07:28.162 --> 00:07:34.811
Player 2 is playing exactly her
Nash strategy then Player 1's

00:07:34.811 --> 00:07:41.459
best response is to respond by
playing his Nash strategy.

00:07:41.459 --> 00:07:45.297
And conversely,
if Player 2 thinks Player 1 is

00:07:45.297 --> 00:07:49.988
playing his Nash strategy,
then Player 2's best response

00:07:49.988 --> 00:07:53.399
indeed is to play her Nash
strategy.

00:07:53.399 --> 00:07:55.050
So, you can that's a
self-fulfilling belief.

00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:57.961
If both people think that's
what's going to happen,

00:07:57.961 --> 00:08:00.290
that is indeed what's going to
happen.

00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:02.200
How about the idea of no
regrets?

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:03.731
So here's Player 1;
she wakes up the next

00:08:03.731 --> 00:08:05.170
morning--oh I'm sorry it was a
he wasn't it?

00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:07.954
He wakes up the next morning
and he says, "I chose

00:08:07.954 --> 00:08:10.000
S_1*,
do I regret this?"

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.110
Well, now he knows what Player
2 chose;

00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:14.685
Player 2 chose S_2*
and he says, "no that's the best

00:08:14.685 --> 00:08:16.797
I could have done.
Given that Player 2 did in fact

00:08:16.797 --> 00:08:18.636
choose S_2*,
I have no regrets about

00:08:18.636 --> 00:08:21.666
choosing S_1*;
that in fact was my best

00:08:21.666 --> 00:08:24.186
response."
Notice that wouldn't be true at

00:08:24.186 --> 00:08:26.573
the other outcome.
So, for example,

00:08:26.573 --> 00:08:31.156
if Player 1 had chosen
S_1* but Player 2 had

00:08:31.156 --> 00:08:35.840
chosen some other strategy,
let's say S_2 prime,

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:38.210
then Player I would have
regrets.

00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:40.322
Player I would wake up the next
morning and say,

00:08:40.322 --> 00:08:42.929
"oh I thought Player 1 was
going to play S_2*;

00:08:42.929 --> 00:08:45.600
in fact, she chose
S_2 prime.

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:47.980
I regret having chosen
S_1*;

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:51.720
I would have rather chosen
S_1 prime.

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:54.930
So, only at the Nash
Equilibrium are there no

00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:56.580
regrets.
Everyone okay with that?

00:08:56.580 --> 00:09:00.302
This is just revisiting really
what we did last time and

00:09:00.302 --> 00:09:03.536
underlining these points.
So, I want to spend quite a lot

00:09:03.536 --> 00:09:06.350
of time today just getting used
to the idea of Nash Equilibrium

00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:08.120
and trying to find Nash
Equilibrium.

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:12.025
(I got to turn off that
projector that's in the way

00:09:12.025 --> 00:09:14.127
there.
Is that going to upset the

00:09:14.127 --> 00:09:17.139
lights a lot?) So okay,
so what I want to do is I want

00:09:17.139 --> 00:09:20.265
to look at some very simple
games with a small number of

00:09:20.265 --> 00:09:22.996
players to start with,
and a small number of

00:09:22.996 --> 00:09:26.473
strategies, and I want us to get
used to how we would find the

00:09:26.473 --> 00:09:28.809
Nash Equilibria in those simple
games.

00:09:28.809 --> 00:09:32.200
We'll start slowly and then
we'll get a little faster.

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:37.401
So, let's start with this game,
very simple game with two

00:09:37.401 --> 00:09:39.403
players.
Each player has three

00:09:39.403 --> 00:09:42.060
strategies and I'm not going to
motivate this game.

00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:46.304
It's just some random game.
Player 1 can choose up,

00:09:46.304 --> 00:09:50.735
middle, or down,
and Player 2 can choose left,

00:09:50.735 --> 00:09:59.032
center,
and right and the payoffs are

00:09:59.032 --> 00:10:13.658
as follows: (0,4) (4,0) (5,3)
(4,0) (0,4) (5,3) again (3,5)

00:10:13.658 --> 00:10:19.856
(3,5) and (6,6).
So, we could discuss--if we had

00:10:19.856 --> 00:10:22.578
more time, we could actually
play this game--but isn't a very

00:10:22.578 --> 00:10:25.170
exciting game,
so let's leave our playing for

00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:28.083
later, and instead,
let's try and figure out what

00:10:28.083 --> 00:10:31.784
are the Nash Equilibria in this
game and how we're going to go

00:10:31.784 --> 00:10:34.531
about finding it.
The way we're going to go about

00:10:34.531 --> 00:10:36.990
finding them is going to mimic
what we did last time.

00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:39.610
Last time, we had a more
complicated game which was two

00:10:39.610 --> 00:10:41.600
players with a continuum of
strategies,

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:44.654
and what we did was we figured
out Player 1's best responses

00:10:44.654 --> 00:10:47.606
and Player 2's best responses:
Player 1's best response to

00:10:47.606 --> 00:10:50.919
what Player 2's doing and Player
2's best response to what Player

00:10:50.919 --> 00:10:53.394
1 is doing;
and then we looked where they

00:10:53.394 --> 00:10:55.870
coincided and that was the Nash
Equilibrium.

00:10:55.870 --> 00:10:59.458
We're going to do exactly the
same in this simple game here,

00:10:59.458 --> 00:11:02.986
so we're going to start off by
figuring out what Player 1's

00:11:02.986 --> 00:11:08.230
best response looks like.
So, in particular,

00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:19.253
what would be Player 1's best
response if Player 2 chooses

00:11:19.253 --> 00:11:23.709
left?
Let's get the mikes up so I can

00:11:23.709 --> 00:11:27.670
sort of challenge people.
Anybody?

00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:32.210
Not such a hard question.
Do you want to try the woman in

00:11:32.210 --> 00:11:35.474
the middle?
Who's closest to the woman in

00:11:35.474 --> 00:11:37.230
the middle?
Yeah.

00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:39.908
Student: The middle.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:11:39.908 --> 00:11:43.533
Okay, so Player 1's best
response in this case is middle,

00:11:43.533 --> 00:11:47.029
because 4 is bigger than 0,
and it's bigger than 3.

00:11:47.029 --> 00:11:52.937
So, to mark that fact what we
can do is--let's put a

00:11:52.937 --> 00:11:59.075
circle--let's make it
green--let's put a circle around

00:11:59.075 --> 00:12:02.059
that 3.
Not hard, so let's do it again.

00:12:02.059 --> 00:12:11.945
What is Player 1's best
response if Player 2 chooses

00:12:11.945 --> 00:12:15.608
center?
Let's get somebody on the other

00:12:15.608 --> 00:12:17.456
side.
(Somebody should feel free to

00:12:17.456 --> 00:12:20.512
cold call somebody here.) How
about cold calling the guy with

00:12:20.512 --> 00:12:23.690
the Yale football shirt on?
There we go.

00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:26.114
Student: Up.
Professor Ben Polak: All

00:12:26.114 --> 00:12:27.700
right, so up is the correct
answer.

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:29.590
(So, one triumph for Yale
football).

00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:34.389
So 4 is bigger than 3,
bigger than 0,

00:12:34.389 --> 00:12:38.840
so good, thank you.
Ale why don't you do the same?

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:44.696
Why don't you cold call
somebody who's going to tell me

00:12:44.696 --> 00:12:50.010
what's the best response for
Player 1 to right.

00:12:50.010 --> 00:12:51.940
Shout it out.
Student: Down.

00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:54.785
Professor Ben Polak:
Down, okay so best response is

00:12:54.785 --> 00:12:57.680
down because 6 is bigger than 5,
which is bigger than 5;

00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:01.960
I mean 6 is bigger than 5.
So what we've done here is

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:04.042
we've found Player 1's best
response to left,

00:13:04.042 --> 00:13:07.497
best response to center,
and best response to right and

00:13:07.497 --> 00:13:11.925
in passing notice that each of
Player 1 strategies is the best

00:13:11.925 --> 00:13:15.633
response to something,
so nothing would be knocked out

00:13:15.633 --> 00:13:18.871
by our domination arguments
here, and nothing would be

00:13:18.871 --> 00:13:22.414
knocked out by our never a best
response arguments here for

00:13:22.414 --> 00:13:24.590
Player 1.
Let's do the same for Player 2;

00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:30.943
so why don't I keep the mikes
doing some cold calling,

00:13:30.943 --> 00:13:37.896
so why don't we--you want to
cold call somebody at the back

00:13:37.896 --> 00:13:44.970
to tell me what is Player 2's
best response against up?

00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:47.694
Student: Left.
Professor Ben Polak: So,

00:13:47.694 --> 00:13:49.804
the gentleman in blue says left
because 4 is bigger 3,

00:13:49.804 --> 00:13:54.174
and 3 is bigger than 0.
Let's switch colors and switch

00:13:54.174 --> 00:13:58.509
polygons and put squares around
these.

00:13:58.509 --> 00:13:59.879
I don't insist on the circles
and the squares.

00:13:59.879 --> 00:14:02.478
If you have a thing for
hexagons you can do that

00:14:02.478 --> 00:14:06.174
to0--whatever you want.
What's Player 2's--let's write

00:14:06.174 --> 00:14:10.109
it in here--the answer,
the answer was that the best

00:14:10.109 --> 00:14:15.696
response was left,
and Player 2's best response to

00:14:15.696 --> 00:14:22.350
middle--so do you want to grab
somebody over there?

00:14:22.350 --> 00:14:24.539
Shout it out!
Student: Center.

00:14:24.539 --> 00:14:27.852
Professor Ben Polak:
Because 4 is bigger than 3,

00:14:27.852 --> 00:14:30.490
and 3 is bigger than 0,
so that's center.

00:14:30.490 --> 00:14:34.238
So, in my color coding that
puts me at--that gives me a

00:14:34.238 --> 00:14:36.910
square here.
And finally,

00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:41.730
Player 2's best response to
down?

00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:50.030
And your turn Ale,
let's grab somebody.

00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:53.351
Student: Left--right.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:14:53.351 --> 00:14:56.248
Right, okay good.
Because 6 is bigger than 5

00:14:56.248 --> 00:15:00.301
again, so here we go.
What we've done now is found

00:15:00.301 --> 00:15:03.927
Player 1's best response
function that was just the

00:15:03.927 --> 00:15:07.990
analog of finding the best
response line we did here.

00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:10.337
Here we drew it as a straight
line in white,

00:15:10.337 --> 00:15:13.613
but we could have drawn it as a
sequence of little circles in

00:15:13.613 --> 00:15:16.389
green;
it would have looked like this.

00:15:16.389 --> 00:15:18.060
The same idea,
I'm not going to do the whole

00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:20.430
thing but there would be a whole
bunch of circles looking like

00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:22.129
this.
And then we found Player 2's

00:15:22.129 --> 00:15:24.876
best response for each choice of
Player 1 and we used pink

00:15:24.876 --> 00:15:27.720
rectangles and that's the same
idea as we did over here.

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:30.068
Here we did it in continuous
strategies in calculus,

00:15:30.068 --> 00:15:32.647
but it's the same idea.
So, imagine I'm drawing lots of

00:15:32.647 --> 00:15:35.216
pink rectangles.
And again, I'm not going to do

00:15:35.216 --> 00:15:37.420
it, but you can do it in your
notes;

00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:40.504
same basic idea.
Just as the Nash Equilibrium

00:15:40.504 --> 00:15:43.542
must be where these best
response lines coincided here

00:15:43.542 --> 00:15:46.808
because that's the point at
which each player is playing a

00:15:46.808 --> 00:15:51.165
best response to each other,
so the Nash Equilibrium over

00:15:51.165 --> 00:15:55.039
here is--do you want to cold
call somebody?

00:15:55.039 --> 00:15:58.758
Do you want to just grab
somebody in the row behind you

00:15:58.758 --> 00:16:00.480
or something,
wherever?

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:03.774
Anybody?
Yeah, I think you in the Italia

00:16:03.774 --> 00:16:05.949
soccer shirt;
I think you're going to get

00:16:05.949 --> 00:16:08.990
picked on, so okay what's the
Nash Equilibrium here?

00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:11.470
Student: The down right.
Professor Ben Polak: So

00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:14.899
the down-right square.
So, the Nash Equilibrium here

00:16:14.899 --> 00:16:20.600
is--no prizes--no World Cup for
that one--is down right.

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:21.980
So, why is that the Nash
Equilibrium?

00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:25.350
Because at that point Player 1
is playing a best response to

00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:28.950
Player 2 and Player 2 is playing
a best response to Player I.

00:16:28.950 --> 00:16:32.259
Now, I want to try and convince
you, particularly those of you

00:16:32.259 --> 00:16:35.569
who are worried by the homework
assignments, that that was not

00:16:35.569 --> 00:16:38.757
rocket science.
It's not hard to find Nash

00:16:38.757 --> 00:16:42.450
Equilibria in games.
It didn't take us very long,

00:16:42.450 --> 00:16:44.820
and we went pretty slow
actually.

00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:49.179
So let's look at another
example.

00:16:49.179 --> 00:16:51.212
Oh, before I do,
notice this--before I leave

00:16:51.212 --> 00:16:53.669
this game I'm just going to make
one other remark.

00:16:53.669 --> 00:16:57.122
Notice that in this game that
each strategy of Player 1 is a

00:16:57.122 --> 00:17:00.438
best response to something,
and each strategy of Player 2

00:17:00.438 --> 00:17:03.710
is a best response to something.
So, had we used the methods of

00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:05.522
earlier on in the class,
that's to say,

00:17:05.522 --> 00:17:08.382
deleting dominated strategies
or deleting strategies that are

00:17:08.382 --> 00:17:12.092
never a best response,
we'd have gotten nowhere in

00:17:12.092 --> 00:17:14.380
this game.
So, Nash Equilibrium goes a

00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:16.789
little further in narrowing down
our predictions.

00:17:16.789 --> 00:17:18.240
But we also learned something
from that.

00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:20.643
We argued last time,
in the last few weeks,

00:17:20.643 --> 00:17:23.161
that rationality,
or even mutual knowledge of

00:17:23.161 --> 00:17:26.023
rationality or even common
knowledge of rationality

00:17:26.023 --> 00:17:29.342
couldn't really get us much
further than deleting dominated

00:17:29.342 --> 00:17:31.309
strategies,
or if you like,

00:17:31.309 --> 00:17:34.299
deleting strategies that are
never best responses.

00:17:34.299 --> 00:17:37.800
So, here we've concluded that
the Nash Equilibrium of this

00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:41.174
game is down right,
a very particular prediction,

00:17:41.174 --> 00:17:44.840
but notice a perfectly rational
player could here,

00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:47.181
could choose middle.
The reason they could choose

00:17:47.181 --> 00:17:50.014
middle, Player 1 could choose
middle is--could be that-- they

00:17:50.014 --> 00:17:52.846
say (rationally) they should
choose middle because they think

00:17:52.846 --> 00:17:54.873
Player 2 is choosing left.
Then you say,

00:17:54.873 --> 00:17:57.170
"well, why would you think
Player 2 is going to choose

00:17:57.170 --> 00:17:58.612
left?"
Player 1 could say,

00:17:58.612 --> 00:18:01.768
"I think Player 2 is going to
choose left because Player 2

00:18:01.768 --> 00:18:04.413
thinks I'm going to play up."
And then you say,

00:18:04.413 --> 00:18:07.239
"but how could Player 2
possibly think that you're going

00:18:07.239 --> 00:18:09.462
to play up?"
And then Player 1 would say,

00:18:09.462 --> 00:18:12.523
"I think Player 2 thinks I'm
going to play up because Player

00:18:12.523 --> 00:18:15.480
2 thinks that I think that he's
going to play center."

00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:17.065
And then you could say,
"how could Player 2 play

00:18:17.065 --> 00:18:18.009
â€¦" etc.,
etc., etc.

00:18:18.009 --> 00:18:20.034
And you could see you could
work around a little cycle

00:18:20.034 --> 00:18:21.466
there.
Nobody would be irrational

00:18:21.466 --> 00:18:23.373
about anything:
Everything would be perfectly

00:18:23.373 --> 00:18:25.019
well justified in terms of
beliefs.

00:18:25.019 --> 00:18:27.549
It's just we wouldn't have a
nice fixed point.

00:18:27.549 --> 00:18:30.420
We wouldn't have a nice point
where it's a simple argument.

00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:33.263
In the case of down right,
Player 1 thinks it's okay to

00:18:33.263 --> 00:18:36.160
play down because he thinks 2 is
going to play right,

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:38.226
and Player 2 thinks they're
going to play right because he

00:18:38.226 --> 00:18:39.640
thinks Player 1's going to play
down.

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:43.289
So, just to underline what I'm
saying rather messily there,

00:18:43.289 --> 00:18:45.806
rationality,
and those kinds of arguments

00:18:45.806 --> 00:18:48.763
should not lead us to the
conclusion that people

00:18:48.763 --> 00:18:51.280
necessarily play Nash
Equilibrium.

00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:54.111
We need a little bit more;
we need a little bit more than

00:18:54.111 --> 00:18:56.049
that.
Nevertheless,

00:18:56.049 --> 00:19:03.150
we are going to focus on Nash
Equilibrium in the course.

00:19:03.150 --> 00:19:11.950
Let's have a look at another
example.

00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:15.736
Again, we'll keep it simple for
now and we'll keep to a

00:19:15.736 --> 00:19:21.524
two-player, three-strategy game;
up, middle, down,

00:19:21.524 --> 00:19:30.337
left, center,
right and this time the payoffs

00:19:30.337 --> 00:19:39.350
are as follows:
(0,2) (2,3) (4,3) (11,1) (3,2)

00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:47.376
(0,0) (0,3) (1,0) and (8,0).
So, this is a slightly messier

00:19:47.376 --> 00:19:49.194
game.
The numbers are really just

00:19:49.194 --> 00:19:52.319
whatever came into my head when
I was writing it down.

00:19:52.319 --> 00:19:56.506
Once again, we want to find out
what the Nash Equilibrium is in

00:19:56.506 --> 00:19:59.680
this game and our method is
exactly the same.

00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:01.624
We're going to,
for each player,

00:20:01.624 --> 00:20:05.513
figure out their best responses
for each possible choice of the

00:20:05.513 --> 00:20:08.534
other player.
So, rather than write it out on

00:20:08.534 --> 00:20:12.444
the--let me just go to my green
circles and red squares and let

00:20:12.444 --> 00:20:16.102
me get my mikes up again,
so we can cold call people a

00:20:16.102 --> 00:20:19.369
bit.
Can we get the--where's the

00:20:19.369 --> 00:20:21.529
mike?
Thank you.

00:20:21.529 --> 00:20:25.861
So, Ale do you want to just
grab somebody and ask them

00:20:25.861 --> 00:20:29.130
what's the best response against
left?

00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:31.750
Grab anybody.
What's the best one against

00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:32.700
left?
Student: Middle.

00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:33.619
Professor Ben Polak:
Middle, okay.

00:20:33.619 --> 00:20:37.093
Good, so middle is the best
response against left,

00:20:37.093 --> 00:20:40.101
because 11 is bigger than 0.
Myto , do you want to grab

00:20:40.101 --> 00:20:42.066
somebody?
What's the best response

00:20:42.066 --> 00:20:43.910
against center?
Student: Middle.

00:20:43.910 --> 00:20:46.193
Professor Ben Polak:
Middle again because 3 is bigger

00:20:46.193 --> 00:20:49.495
than 2 is bigger than 1.
And grab somebody at the back

00:20:49.495 --> 00:20:53.690
and tell me what the best
response is against right?

00:20:53.690 --> 00:20:58.960
Anybody just dive in, yep.
Student: Down.

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:01.880
Professor Ben Polak:
Okay down, good.

00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:06.676
Let's do the same for the
column player,

00:21:06.676 --> 00:21:10.736
so watch the column
player's--Ale,

00:21:10.736 --> 00:21:14.857
find somebody;
take the guy who is two rows

00:21:14.857 --> 00:21:18.943
behind you who is about to fall
asleep and ask him what's the

00:21:18.943 --> 00:21:22.659
best response to up?
Student: Best response

00:21:22.659 --> 00:21:24.834
is--for which player?
Professor Ben Polak: For

00:21:24.834 --> 00:21:26.941
Player 2.
What's Player 2's best response

00:21:26.941 --> 00:21:28.133
for up?
Sorry that's unfair,

00:21:28.133 --> 00:21:31.020
pick on somebody else.
That's all right;

00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:33.490
get the guy right behind you.
What's the best response for up?

00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:35.563
Student: So it's
[inaudible]

00:21:35.563 --> 00:21:39.282
Professor Ben Polak: So,
this is a slightly more tricky

00:21:39.282 --> 00:21:42.839
one.
The best response to up is

00:21:42.839 --> 00:21:46.563
either c or r.
This is why we got you to sign

00:21:46.563 --> 00:21:49.890
those legal forms.
Best ones to up is either c or

00:21:49.890 --> 00:21:53.950
r.
The best response to middle?

00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:56.651
Student: Center.
Professor Ben Polak: Is

00:21:56.651 --> 00:22:04.160
center, thank you.
And the best response to down?

00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:07.140
Student: Left.
Professor Ben Polak: So,

00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:09.150
the best response to down is
left.

00:22:09.150 --> 00:22:10.540
Here again, it didn't take us
very long.

00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:14.082
We're getting quicker at this.
The Nash Equilibrium in this

00:22:14.082 --> 00:22:18.502
case is--let's go back to the
guy who was asleep and give him

00:22:18.502 --> 00:22:22.750
an easier question this time.
So the Nash Equilibrium in this

00:22:22.750 --> 00:22:24.634
case is?
Student: Nash

00:22:24.634 --> 00:22:27.238
Equilibrium would be the two
[inaudible]

00:22:27.238 --> 00:22:30.709
Professor Ben Polak:
Exactly, so the middle of

00:22:30.709 --> 00:22:32.243
center.
Notice that this is a Nash

00:22:32.243 --> 00:22:33.690
Equilibrium.
Why is it the Nash Equilibrium?

00:22:33.690 --> 00:22:36.220
Because each player is playing
a best response to each other.

00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:39.472
If I'm Player 1 and I think
that Player 2 is playing center,

00:22:39.472 --> 00:22:41.356
I should play middle.
If I'm Player 2,

00:22:41.356 --> 00:22:43.589
I think Player 1 is playing
middle, I should play center.

00:22:43.589 --> 00:22:46.162
If, in fact,
we play this way neither person

00:22:46.162 --> 00:22:47.889
has any regrets.
Notice they didn't do

00:22:47.889 --> 00:22:49.634
particularly well in this game.
In particular,

00:22:49.634 --> 00:22:52.381
Player 1 would have liked to
get this 11 and this 8,

00:22:52.381 --> 00:22:54.859
but they don't regret their
action because,

00:22:54.859 --> 00:22:58.791
given that Player 2 played
center, the best they could have

00:22:58.791 --> 00:23:01.910
got was 3, which they got by
playing middle.

00:23:01.910 --> 00:23:07.922
Notice in passing in this game,
that best responses needn't be

00:23:07.922 --> 00:23:10.609
unique.
Sometimes they can be a tie in

00:23:10.609 --> 00:23:13.900
your best response.
It could happen.

00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:15.631
So, what have we seen?
We've seen how to find Nash

00:23:15.631 --> 00:23:18.004
Equilibrium.
And clearly it's very closely

00:23:18.004 --> 00:23:21.960
related to the idea of best
response, which is an idea we've

00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:24.910
been developing over the last
week or so.

00:23:24.910 --> 00:23:28.564
But let's go back earlier in
the course, and ask how does it

00:23:28.564 --> 00:23:32.443
relate to the idea of dominance?
This will be our third concept

00:23:32.443 --> 00:23:34.502
in this course.
We had a concept about

00:23:34.502 --> 00:23:36.879
dominance, we had a concept
about best response,

00:23:36.879 --> 00:23:38.750
and now we're at Nash
Equilibrium.

00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:40.886
It's, I think,
obvious how it relates to best

00:23:40.886 --> 00:23:43.119
response: it's when best
responses coincide.

00:23:43.119 --> 00:23:46.690
How about how it relates to
dominance?

00:23:46.690 --> 00:23:54.208
Well, to do that let's go back.
What we're going to do is we're

00:23:54.208 --> 00:24:00.416
going to relate the Nash
Equilibrium to our idea of

00:24:00.416 --> 00:24:03.247
dominance,
or of domination,

00:24:03.247 --> 00:24:07.758
and to do that an obvious place
to start is to go back to a game

00:24:07.758 --> 00:24:13.475
that we've seen before.
So here's a game where Player 1

00:24:13.475 --> 00:24:21.185
and Player 2 are choosing Î¬
and Î² and the payoffs are

00:24:21.185 --> 00:24:26.609
(0,0) (3,-1) (-1,3) and (1,1).
So, this is the game we saw the

00:24:26.609 --> 00:24:29.420
first time.
This is the Prisoner's Dilemma.

00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:36.202
We know in this game--I'm not
going to bother to cold call

00:24:36.202 --> 00:24:41.676
people for it--we know in this
game that Î²

00:24:41.676 --> 00:24:48.339
is dominated â€“is strictly
dominated by Î¬.

00:24:48.339 --> 00:24:50.509
It's something that we learned
the very first time.

00:24:50.509 --> 00:24:53.405
Just to check:
so against Î¬,

00:24:53.405 --> 00:24:56.392
choosing Î¬
gets you 0, Î²

00:24:56.392 --> 00:24:58.554
gets you -1.
Against Î²

00:24:58.554 --> 00:25:00.238
choosing Î¬
gets you 3, Î²

00:25:00.238 --> 00:25:03.299
gets you 1, and in either case
Î¬ is strictly better,

00:25:03.299 --> 00:25:06.153
so Î¬ strictly dominates
Î², and of course it's the

00:25:06.153 --> 00:25:09.450
same for the column player since
the game's completely symmetric.

00:25:09.450 --> 00:25:11.200
So now, let's find the Nash
Equilibrium in this game.

00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:15.003
I think we know what it's going
to be, but let's just do it in

00:25:15.003 --> 00:25:20.074
this sort of slow way.
So, the best response to Î¬

00:25:20.074 --> 00:25:24.796
must be Î¬.
The best response to Î²

00:25:24.796 --> 00:25:29.484
must be Î¬,
and for the column player the

00:25:29.484 --> 00:25:33.960
best response to Î¬
must be Î¬,

00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:37.130
and the best response to Î²
must be Î¬.

00:25:37.130 --> 00:25:39.660
Everyone okay with that?
I'm just kind of--I'm rushing

00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:43.049
it a bit because it's kind of
obvious, is that right?

00:25:43.049 --> 00:25:49.637
So, the Nash Equilibrium in
this game is (Î¬,

00:25:49.637 --> 00:25:51.859
Î¬).
In other words,

00:25:51.859 --> 00:25:55.370
it's what we would have arrived
at had we just deleted strictly

00:25:55.370 --> 00:25:58.230
dominated strategies.
So, here's a case where Î¬

00:25:58.230 --> 00:26:00.529
strictly dominates Î²,
and sure enough Nash

00:26:00.529 --> 00:26:03.785
Equilibrium coincides,
it gives us the same answer,

00:26:03.785 --> 00:26:06.650
both people choose Î¬
in this game.

00:26:06.650 --> 00:26:09.813
So, there's nothing--there's no
news here, I'm just checking

00:26:09.813 --> 00:26:12.440
that we're not getting anything
weird going on.

00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:15.789
So, let's just be a bit more
careful.

00:26:15.789 --> 00:26:19.812
How do we know it's the
case--I'm going to claim it's

00:26:19.812 --> 00:26:24.298
the case, that no strictly
dominated strategy--in this case

00:26:24.298 --> 00:26:29.016
Î²--no strictly dominated
strategy could ever be played in

00:26:29.016 --> 00:26:32.768
a Nash Equilibrium.
I claim--and that's a good

00:26:32.768 --> 00:26:36.824
thing because we want these
ideas to coincide--I claim that

00:26:36.824 --> 00:26:41.161
no strictly dominated strategy
could ever be played in the Nash

00:26:41.161 --> 00:26:43.270
Equilibrium.
Why is that the case?

00:26:43.270 --> 00:26:46.866
There's a guy up here, yeah.
Student: The strictly

00:26:46.866 --> 00:26:49.640
dominated strategy isn't the
best response of anything.

00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:50.650
Professor Ben Polak:
Good.

00:26:50.650 --> 00:26:53.005
Student: It should be
the best response to find the

00:26:53.005 --> 00:26:54.464
Nash Equilibrium.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:26:54.464 --> 00:26:56.168
Good, very good.
So a strictly dominated

00:26:56.168 --> 00:26:58.779
strategy is never a best
response to anything.

00:26:58.779 --> 00:27:00.942
In particular,
the thing that dominates it

00:27:00.942 --> 00:27:02.894
always does better.
So, in particular,

00:27:02.894 --> 00:27:05.661
it can't be a best response to
the thing being played in the

00:27:05.661 --> 00:27:08.442
Nash Equilibrium.
So that's actually a very good

00:27:08.442 --> 00:27:11.635
proof that proves that no
strictly dominated strategy

00:27:11.635 --> 00:27:14.460
could ever be played in a Nash
Equilibrium.

00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:17.418
But now we have,
unfortunately,

00:27:17.418 --> 00:27:20.672
a little wrinkle,
and the wrinkle,

00:27:20.672 --> 00:27:24.813
unfortunately,
is weakly dominated--is weak

00:27:24.813 --> 00:27:27.640
domination.
So we've argued,

00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:31.524
it was fairly easy to argue,
that no strictly dominated

00:27:31.524 --> 00:27:35.407
strategy is ever going to
reappear annoyingly in a Nash

00:27:35.407 --> 00:27:37.858
Equilibrium.
But unfortunately,

00:27:37.858 --> 00:27:41.680
the same is not true about
weakly dominated strategies.

00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:44.026
And in some sense,
you had a foreshadowing of this

00:27:44.026 --> 00:27:46.420
problem a little bit on the
homework assignment,

00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:49.146
where you saw on one of the
problems (I think it was the

00:27:49.146 --> 00:27:52.220
second problem on the homework
assignment) that deleting weakly

00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:55.244
dominated strategies can lead
you to do things that might make

00:27:55.244 --> 00:27:58.953
you feel a little bit uneasy.
So weak domination is really

00:27:58.953 --> 00:28:02.125
not such a secure notion as
strict domination,

00:28:02.125 --> 00:28:05.720
and we'll see here as a trivial
example of that.

00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:08.242
And again, so here's the
trivial example,

00:28:08.242 --> 00:28:11.900
not an interesting example,
but it just makes the point.

00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:17.289
So here's a 2 x 2 game.
Player 1 can choose up or down

00:28:17.289 --> 00:28:24.032
and Player 2 can choose left or
right, and the payoffs are

00:28:24.032 --> 00:28:29.119
really trivial:
(1,1) (0,0) (0,0) (0,0).

00:28:29.119 --> 00:28:32.324
So, let's figure out what the
Nash Equilibrium is in this game

00:28:32.324 --> 00:28:35.740
and I'm not going to bother cold
calling because it's too easy.

00:28:35.740 --> 00:28:41.485
So the best response for Player
1, if Player 2 plays left is

00:28:41.485 --> 00:28:46.258
clear to choose up.
And the best response of Player

00:28:46.258 --> 00:28:51.451
1 if Player 2 chooses right
is--well, either up or down will

00:28:51.451 --> 00:28:54.619
do, because either way he gets
0.

00:28:54.619 --> 00:28:57.270
So these are both best
responses.

00:28:57.270 --> 00:28:58.560
Is that correct?
They're both best responses;

00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:04.055
they both did equally well.
Conversely, Player 2's best

00:29:04.055 --> 00:29:09.019
response if Player 1 chooses up
is, sure enough,

00:29:09.019 --> 00:29:11.713
to choose left,
and that's kind of the answer

00:29:11.713 --> 00:29:14.099
we'd like to have,
but unfortunately,

00:29:14.099 --> 00:29:20.014
when Player 1 plays down,
Player 2's best response is

00:29:20.014 --> 00:29:23.870
either left or right.
It makes no difference.

00:29:23.870 --> 00:29:30.906
They get 0 either way.
So, what are the Nash

00:29:30.906 --> 00:29:34.032
Equilibria in this game?
So, notice the first

00:29:34.032 --> 00:29:36.890
observation is that there's more
than one Nash Equilibrium in

00:29:36.890 --> 00:29:40.319
this game.
We haven't seen that before.

00:29:40.319 --> 00:29:43.355
There's a Nash Equilibrium with
everybody in the room I think,

00:29:43.355 --> 00:29:46.242
I hope, thinks it's kind of the
sensible prediction in this

00:29:46.242 --> 00:29:47.405
game.
In this game,

00:29:47.405 --> 00:29:49.994
I think all of you,
I hope, all of you if you're

00:29:49.994 --> 00:29:53.519
Player 1 would choose up and all
of you for Player 2 would choose

00:29:53.519 --> 00:29:54.980
left.
Is that right?

00:29:54.980 --> 00:29:58.216
Is that correct?
It's hard to imagine coming up

00:29:58.216 --> 00:30:01.969
with an argument that wouldn't
lead you to choose up and left

00:30:01.969 --> 00:30:06.939
in this game.
However, unfortunately,

00:30:06.939 --> 00:30:15.396
that is--this isn't
unfortunate, up left is a Nash

00:30:15.396 --> 00:30:21.609
Equilibrium but so is down
right.

00:30:21.609 --> 00:30:26.335
If Player 2 is choosing right,
your best response weakly is to

00:30:26.335 --> 00:30:29.893
choose down.
If Player 1 is choosing down,

00:30:29.893 --> 00:30:34.329
Player 2's best response weakly
is to choose right.

00:30:34.329 --> 00:30:39.140
Here, this is arriving because
of the definition of Nash;

00:30:39.140 --> 00:30:44.039
it's a very definite definition.
I deleted it now.

00:30:44.039 --> 00:30:45.429
When we looked at the
definition we said,

00:30:45.429 --> 00:30:47.478
something is a Nash Equilibrium
was each person is playing a

00:30:47.478 --> 00:30:50.949
best response to each other;
another way of saying that is

00:30:50.949 --> 00:30:54.609
no player has a strict incentive
to deviate.

00:30:54.609 --> 00:30:57.450
No player can do strictly
better by moving away.

00:30:57.450 --> 00:31:02.069
So here at down right Player 1
doesn't do strictly better;

00:31:02.069 --> 00:31:05.160
it's just a tie if she moves
away.

00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:08.835
And Player 2 doesn't do
strictly better if he moves

00:31:08.835 --> 00:31:10.220
away.
It's a tie.

00:31:10.220 --> 00:31:12.816
He gets 0 either way.
So, here we have something

00:31:12.816 --> 00:31:14.829
which is going to worry us going
on in the course.

00:31:14.829 --> 00:31:17.989
Sometimes we're getting--not
only are we getting many Nash

00:31:17.989 --> 00:31:21.259
Equilibria, that's something
which--that shouldn't worry us,

00:31:21.259 --> 00:31:25.005
it's a fact of life.
But in this case one of the

00:31:25.005 --> 00:31:28.895
Nash Equilibria seems silly.
If you went and tried to

00:31:28.895 --> 00:31:32.082
explain to your roommates and
said, "I predict both of these

00:31:32.082 --> 00:31:34.619
outcomes in this game," they'd
laugh at you.

00:31:34.619 --> 00:31:39.023
It's obvious in some sense that
this has to be the sensible

00:31:39.023 --> 00:31:42.789
prediction.
So, just a sort of worrying

00:31:42.789 --> 00:31:47.304
note before we move on.
So, this was pretty formal and

00:31:47.304 --> 00:31:51.394
kind of not very exciting so
far, so let's try and move on to

00:31:51.394 --> 00:31:55.279
something a little bit more fun.
So, what I want to do now is I

00:31:55.279 --> 00:31:56.980
want to look at a different
game.

00:31:56.980 --> 00:31:58.771
Again, we're going to try and
find Nash Equilibrium in this

00:31:58.771 --> 00:32:00.130
game but we're going to do more
than that,

00:32:00.130 --> 00:32:03.634
we're going to talk about the
game a bit, and a feature of

00:32:03.634 --> 00:32:06.830
this game which is--to
distinguish it from what we've

00:32:06.830 --> 00:32:10.519
done so far--is the game we're
about to look at involves many

00:32:10.519 --> 00:32:13.457
players,
although each player only has a

00:32:13.457 --> 00:32:16.610
few strategies.
So, what I want to do is I want

00:32:16.610 --> 00:32:20.302
to convince you how to find--to
discuss how to find Nash

00:32:20.302 --> 00:32:23.471
Equilibria in the game which,
unlike these games,

00:32:23.471 --> 00:32:25.674
doesn't just have two
players--it has many

00:32:25.674 --> 00:32:31.510
players--but fortunately,
not many strategies per player.

00:32:31.510 --> 00:32:41.909
So let me use this board.
So this is going to be called

00:32:41.909 --> 00:32:47.719
The Investment Game and we're
going to play this game,

00:32:47.719 --> 00:32:53.774
although not for real.
So, the players in this game,

00:32:53.774 --> 00:32:59.489
as I've just suggested,
the players are going to be

00:32:59.489 --> 00:33:01.765
you.
So, everyone who is getting

00:33:01.765 --> 00:33:05.207
sleepy just looking at this kind
of analysis should wake up now,

00:33:05.207 --> 00:33:09.003
you have to play.
The strategies in this game are

00:33:09.003 --> 00:33:14.410
very simple, the strategy sets,
or the strategy alternatives.

00:33:14.410 --> 00:33:26.736
Each of you can choose between
investing nothing in a class

00:33:26.736 --> 00:33:34.444
project, $0, or invest $10.
So, I'm sometimes going to

00:33:34.444 --> 00:33:36.999
refer to investing nothing as
not investing,

00:33:36.999 --> 00:33:39.710
is that okay?
That seems like a natural to do.

00:33:39.710 --> 00:33:42.759
You're either going to invest
$10 or nothing,

00:33:42.759 --> 00:33:46.386
you're not going to invest.
So that's the players and those

00:33:46.386 --> 00:33:48.681
are the strategies,
so as usual we're missing

00:33:48.681 --> 00:33:51.974
something.
What we're missing are the

00:33:51.974 --> 00:33:56.539
payoffs.
So here are the payoffs;

00:33:56.539 --> 00:34:02.920
so the payoffs are as follows:
if you don't invest,

00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:08.024
if you do not invest,
you invest nothing,

00:34:08.024 --> 00:34:14.240
then your payoff is $0.
So nothing ventured nothing

00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:19.678
gained: natural thing.
But if you do invest $10,

00:34:19.678 --> 00:34:26.083
remember each of you is going
to invest $10 then your

00:34:26.083 --> 00:34:30.640
individual payoffs are as
follows.

00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:37.126
Here's the good news.
You're going to get a profit of

00:34:37.126 --> 00:34:39.439
$5.
The way this is going to work

00:34:39.439 --> 00:34:43.034
is you're going to invest $10 so
you'll make a gross profit of

00:34:43.034 --> 00:34:46.630
$15 minus the $10 you originally
invested for a net of $5.

00:34:46.630 --> 00:34:53.510
So a net profit--so $5 net
profit, that's the good news.

00:34:53.510 --> 00:34:59.900
But that requires more than 90%
of the class to invest,

00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:06.289
greater than or equal to 90% of
the class to invest.

00:35:06.289 --> 00:35:13.599
If more than 90% of the class
invests, you're going to make

00:35:13.599 --> 00:35:18.751
essentially 50% profit.
Unfortunately,

00:35:18.751 --> 00:35:25.182
the bad news is you're going to
lose your $10,

00:35:25.182 --> 00:35:33.615
get nothing back so this is a
net loss, if fewer than 90% of

00:35:33.615 --> 00:35:38.429
the class invest.
I mean a key rule here;

00:35:38.429 --> 00:35:41.905
you're not allowed to talk to
each other: no communication in

00:35:41.905 --> 00:35:44.325
the class.
No hand signals,

00:35:44.325 --> 00:35:47.670
no secret winks,
nothing else.

00:35:47.670 --> 00:35:50.610
So, everyone understand the
game?

00:35:50.610 --> 00:35:54.469
Including up in the balcony,
everyone understand the game?

00:35:54.469 --> 00:35:56.934
So, what I want you to do--I
should say first of all,

00:35:56.934 --> 00:35:59.636
we can't play this game for
real because there's something

00:35:59.636 --> 00:36:02.860
like 250 of you and I don't have
that kind of cash lying around.

00:36:02.860 --> 00:36:06.949
So we're not--pretend we're
playing this for real.

00:36:06.949 --> 00:36:11.723
So, without communicating I
want each of you to write on the

00:36:11.723 --> 00:36:16.820
corner of your notepad whether
you're going to invest or not.

00:36:16.820 --> 00:36:22.242
You can write Y if you're going
to and N if you're not going to

00:36:22.242 --> 00:36:23.707
invest.
Don't discuss it with each

00:36:23.707 --> 00:36:26.233
other;
just write down on the corner

00:36:26.233 --> 00:36:30.921
of your notepad Y if you're
going to invest and N if you're

00:36:30.921 --> 00:36:36.780
not going to invest.
Don't discuss it guys.

00:36:36.780 --> 00:36:44.574
Now, show your neighbor what
you did, just so you can--your

00:36:44.574 --> 00:36:50.626
neighbor can make you honest.
Now, let's have a show of

00:36:50.626 --> 00:36:55.228
hands, so what I want to do is I
want to have a show of hands,

00:36:55.228 --> 00:36:57.730
everybody who invested.
Don't look around;

00:36:57.730 --> 00:37:00.340
just raise your hands,
everyone who invested?

00:37:00.340 --> 00:37:04.280
Everyone who didn't invest!
Oh that's more than 10%.

00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:07.785
Let's do that again.
So everyone who invested raised

00:37:07.785 --> 00:37:10.908
their hands â€¦
and everyone who didn't invest

00:37:10.908 --> 00:37:14.190
raise their hands.
So I don't know what that is,

00:37:14.190 --> 00:37:18.019
maybe that's about half.
So now I'm thinking we should

00:37:18.019 --> 00:37:21.665
have played this game for real.
I want to get some discussion

00:37:21.665 --> 00:37:24.321
going about this.
I'm going to discuss this for a

00:37:24.321 --> 00:37:26.466
while;
there's a lot to be said about

00:37:26.466 --> 00:37:29.090
this game.
Let me borrow that,

00:37:29.090 --> 00:37:32.820
can I borrow this?
So this guy;

00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:36.730
so what did you do?
Student: I invested.

00:37:36.730 --> 00:37:40.230
Professor Ben Polak: Why
did you invest?

00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:45.599
Student: Because I think
I can lose $10.

00:37:45.599 --> 00:37:47.757
Professor Ben Polak: All
right, so he's rich,

00:37:47.757 --> 00:37:51.559
that's okay.
You can pay for lunch.

00:37:51.559 --> 00:37:53.360
Who didn't invest,
non-investors?

00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:56.230
Yeah, here's one,
so why didn't you invest?

00:37:56.230 --> 00:37:57.780
Shout it out so everyone can
hear.

00:37:57.780 --> 00:38:01.972
Student: I didn't invest
because to make a profit there

00:38:01.972 --> 00:38:05.889
needs to be at least a 2:1
chance that everyone else--that

00:38:05.889 --> 00:38:07.680
90% invest.
Professor Ben Polak: You

00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:09.314
mean to make an expected profit?
Student: Yeah,

00:38:09.314 --> 00:38:11.630
you only get half back but you
would lose the whole thing.

00:38:11.630 --> 00:38:13.747
Professor Ben Polak: I
see, okay so you're doing some

00:38:13.747 --> 00:38:17.240
kind of expected calculation.
Other reasons out there?

00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:21.289
What did you do?
Student: I invested.

00:38:21.289 --> 00:38:22.410
Professor Ben Polak: I'm
finding the suckers in the room.

00:38:22.410 --> 00:38:26.437
Okay, so you invested and why?
Student: You usually

00:38:26.437 --> 00:38:28.675
stand to gain something.
I don't see why anybody would

00:38:28.675 --> 00:38:31.909
just not invest because they
would never gain anything.

00:38:31.909 --> 00:38:33.950
Professor Ben Polak:
Your name is?

00:38:33.950 --> 00:38:35.365
Student: Clayton.
Professor Ben Polak: So

00:38:35.365 --> 00:38:37.085
Clayton's saying only by
investing can I gain something

00:38:37.085 --> 00:38:39.314
here,
not investing seems kind of--it

00:38:39.314 --> 00:38:41.480
doesn't seem brave in some
sense.

00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:45.460
Anyone else?
Student: It's basically

00:38:45.460 --> 00:38:49.829
the same game as the (1,1) (0,0)
game in terms they're both Nash

00:38:49.829 --> 00:38:53.503
Equilibrium,
but the payoffs aren't the same

00:38:53.503 --> 00:38:58.599
scale and you have to really be
risk adverse not to invest,

00:38:58.599 --> 00:39:00.366
so I thought it would be--
Professor Ben Polak: So

00:39:00.366 --> 00:39:01.535
you invested?
Student: I invested,

00:39:01.535 --> 00:39:02.915
yeah.
Professor Ben Polak: All

00:39:02.915 --> 00:39:05.287
right, so let me give this to
Ale before I screw up the sound

00:39:05.287 --> 00:39:07.289
system here.
Okay, so we got different

00:39:07.289 --> 00:39:10.071
answers out there.
Could people hear each other's

00:39:10.071 --> 00:39:11.989
answer a bit?
Yeah.

00:39:11.989 --> 00:39:13.659
So, we have lots of different
views out here.

00:39:13.659 --> 00:39:16.530
We have half the people
investing and half the people

00:39:16.530 --> 00:39:19.069
not investing roughly,
and I think you can make

00:39:19.069 --> 00:39:21.327
arguments either way.
So we'll come back to whether

00:39:21.327 --> 00:39:22.750
it's exactly the same as the
game we just saw.

00:39:22.750 --> 00:39:25.291
So the argument that-- I'm
sorry your name--that Patrick

00:39:25.291 --> 00:39:27.739
made is it looks a lot like the
game we saw before.

00:39:27.739 --> 00:39:29.469
We'll see it is related,
clearly.

00:39:29.469 --> 00:39:32.090
It's related in one sense which
we'll discuss now.

00:39:32.090 --> 00:39:48.740
So, what are the Nash
Equilibria in this game?

00:39:48.740 --> 00:39:54.101
Let me get the woman up here?
Student: No one invests

00:39:54.101 --> 00:39:56.039
and everyone's happy they didn't
lose anything;

00:39:56.039 --> 00:39:59.210
or everyone invests and
nobody's happy.

00:39:59.210 --> 00:40:01.200
Professor Ben Polak:
Good, I've forgotten your name?

00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:03.493
Student: Kate.
Professor Ben Polak: So

00:40:03.493 --> 00:40:06.616
Kate's saying that there are two
Nash Equilibria and (with

00:40:06.616 --> 00:40:09.739
apologies to Jude) I'm going to
put this on the board.

00:40:09.739 --> 00:40:21.699
There are two Nash Equilibria
here, one is all invest and

00:40:21.699 --> 00:40:30.188
another one is no one invest.
These are both Nash Equilibria

00:40:30.188 --> 00:40:32.838
in this game.
And let's just check that they

00:40:32.838 --> 00:40:35.269
are exactly the argument that
Kate said.

00:40:35.269 --> 00:40:38.574
That if everyone invests then
no one would have any regrets,

00:40:38.574 --> 00:40:41.150
everyone's best response would
be to invest.

00:40:41.150 --> 00:40:43.624
If nobody invests,
then everyone would be happy

00:40:43.624 --> 00:40:46.530
not to have invested,
that would be a best response.

00:40:46.530 --> 00:40:48.399
It's just--in terms of what
Patrick said,

00:40:48.399 --> 00:40:50.689
it is a game with two
equilibria like the previous

00:40:50.689 --> 00:40:53.165
game and there were other
similarities to the previous

00:40:53.165 --> 00:40:54.974
game,
but it's a little bit--the

00:40:54.974 --> 00:40:57.861
equilibria in this case are not
quite the same as the other

00:40:57.861 --> 00:40:59.668
game.
In the other game that other

00:40:59.668 --> 00:41:02.335
equilibrium, the (0,0)
equilibrium seemed like a silly

00:41:02.335 --> 00:41:04.945
equilibrium.
It isn't like we'd ever predict

00:41:04.945 --> 00:41:08.117
it happening.Whereas here,
the equilibrium with nobody

00:41:08.117 --> 00:41:11.409
investing actually is quite a
plausible equilibrium.

00:41:11.409 --> 00:41:16.630
If I think no one else is
investing then I strictly prefer

00:41:16.630 --> 00:41:19.470
not to invest,
is that right?

00:41:19.470 --> 00:41:25.340
So, two remarks about this.
Do you want to do more before I

00:41:25.340 --> 00:41:28.706
do two remarks?
Well, let's have one remark at

00:41:28.706 --> 00:41:31.443
least.
How did we find those Nash

00:41:31.443 --> 00:41:34.791
Equilibria?
What was our sophisticated

00:41:34.791 --> 00:41:39.814
mathematical technique for
finding the Nash Equilibria on

00:41:39.814 --> 00:41:44.207
this game?
We should - can you get the

00:41:44.207 --> 00:41:48.630
mike on - is it Kate,
is that right?

00:41:48.630 --> 00:41:51.059
So how do you find the Nash
Equilibria?

00:41:51.059 --> 00:41:55.565
Student: [Inaudible]
Professor Ben Polak: All

00:41:55.565 --> 00:41:59.992
right, so in principle you
could--I mean that works but in

00:41:59.992 --> 00:42:02.331
principle,
you could have looked at every

00:42:02.331 --> 00:42:05.000
possible combination and there's
lots of possible combinations.

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:08.247
It could have been a
combination where 1% invested

00:42:08.247 --> 00:42:11.230
and 99% didn't,
and 2% invested and 98% didn't

00:42:11.230 --> 00:42:14.014
and so on and so forth.
We could have checked

00:42:14.014 --> 00:42:16.713
rigorously what everyone's best
response was in each case,

00:42:16.713 --> 00:42:19.270
but what did we actually end up
doing in this game?

00:42:19.270 --> 00:42:27.510
What's the method?
The guy in--yeah.

00:42:27.510 --> 00:42:32.322
Student: [Inaudible]
Professor Ben Polak:

00:42:32.322 --> 00:42:36.690
That's true, so that certainly
makes it easier.

00:42:36.690 --> 00:42:39.271
I claim, however--I mean you're
being--both of you are being

00:42:39.271 --> 00:42:41.634
more rigorous and more
mathematical than I'm tempted to

00:42:41.634 --> 00:42:45.006
be here.
I think the easy method

00:42:45.006 --> 00:42:51.690
here--the easy sophisticated
math here is "to guess."

00:42:51.690 --> 00:42:54.800
My guess is the easy thing to
do is to guess what flight would

00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:56.840
be the equilibrium here and then
what?

00:42:56.840 --> 00:43:02.237
Then check;
so a good method here in these

00:43:02.237 --> 00:43:06.821
games is to guess and check.
And guess and check is really

00:43:06.821 --> 00:43:08.800
not a bad way to try and find
Nash Equilibria.

00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:14.599
The reason it's not a bad way
is because checking is fairly

00:43:14.599 --> 00:43:16.220
easy.
Guessing is hard;

00:43:16.220 --> 00:43:17.941
you might miss something.
There might be a Nash

00:43:17.941 --> 00:43:19.810
Equilibrium hidden under a stone
somewhere.

00:43:19.810 --> 00:43:22.671
In America it's a "rock."
It may hidden under a rock

00:43:22.671 --> 00:43:24.564
somewhere.
But checking with something

00:43:24.564 --> 00:43:26.782
that you--some putative
equilibrium, some candid

00:43:26.782 --> 00:43:28.385
equilibrium,
checking whether it is an

00:43:28.385 --> 00:43:30.500
equilibrium is easy because all
you have to do is check that

00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:33.099
nobody wants to move,
nobody wants to deviate.

00:43:33.099 --> 00:43:35.082
So again, in practice that's
what you're going to end up

00:43:35.082 --> 00:43:37.038
doing in this game,
and it turns out to be very

00:43:37.038 --> 00:43:39.301
easy to guess and check,
which is why you're able to

00:43:39.301 --> 00:43:41.571
find it.
So guess and check is a very

00:43:41.571 --> 00:43:45.389
useful method in these games
where there are lots and lots of

00:43:45.389 --> 00:43:49.064
players,
but not many strategies per

00:43:49.064 --> 00:43:52.809
player, and it works pretty
well.

00:43:52.809 --> 00:43:54.811
Okay, now we've got this game
up on the board,

00:43:54.811 --> 00:43:57.213
I want to spend a while
discussing it because it's kind

00:43:57.213 --> 00:44:00.011
of important.
So, what I want to do now is I

00:44:00.011 --> 00:44:02.870
want to remind us what happened
just now.

00:44:02.870 --> 00:44:06.580
So, what happened just now?
Can we raise the yeses again,

00:44:06.580 --> 00:44:09.532
the invest again.
Raise the not invested,

00:44:09.532 --> 00:44:12.181
not invest.
And I want to remind you guys

00:44:12.181 --> 00:44:15.453
you all owe me $10.
What I want to do is I want to

00:44:15.453 --> 00:44:17.976
play it again.
No communication,

00:44:17.976 --> 00:44:22.798
write it down again on the
corner of your notepad what

00:44:22.798 --> 00:44:27.980
you're going to do.
Don't communicate you guys;

00:44:27.980 --> 00:44:34.685
show your neighbor.
And now we're going to poll

00:44:34.685 --> 00:44:37.333
again, so ready.
Without cheating,

00:44:37.333 --> 00:44:42.531
without looking around you,
if you invested--let Jude get a

00:44:42.531 --> 00:44:47.640
good view of you--if you
invested raise your hand now.

00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:52.533
If you didn't invest--okay.
All right, can I look at the

00:44:52.533 --> 00:44:55.389
investors again?
Raise your hands honestly;

00:44:55.389 --> 00:44:57.916
we've got a few investors
still, so these guys really owe

00:44:57.916 --> 00:44:59.179
me money now,
that's good.

00:44:59.179 --> 00:45:04.550
Let's do it again,
third time, hang on a second.

00:45:04.550 --> 00:45:08.264
So third time,
write it down,

00:45:08.264 --> 00:45:14.990
and pretend this is real cash.
Now, if you invested the third

00:45:14.990 --> 00:45:19.253
time raise your hand.
There's a few suckers born

00:45:19.253 --> 00:45:23.659
everyday but basically.
So, where are we heading here?

00:45:23.659 --> 00:45:26.349
Where are we heading pretty
rapidly?

00:45:26.349 --> 00:45:29.039
We're heading towards an
equilibrium;

00:45:29.039 --> 00:45:30.920
let's just make sure we confirm
that.

00:45:30.920 --> 00:45:33.748
So everyone who didn't invest
that third time raise your

00:45:33.748 --> 00:45:35.250
hands.
That's pretty close;

00:45:35.250 --> 00:45:40.070
that show of hands is pretty
close to a Nash Equilibrium

00:45:40.070 --> 00:45:43.823
strategy, is that right?
So, here's an example of a

00:45:43.823 --> 00:45:46.826
third reason from what we
already mentioned last time,

00:45:46.826 --> 00:45:49.773
but a third reason why we might
be interested in Nash

00:45:49.773 --> 00:45:52.588
Equilibria.
There are certain circumstances

00:45:52.588 --> 00:45:56.280
in which play converges in the
natural sense--not in a formal

00:45:56.280 --> 00:45:59.420
sense but in a natural sense--to
an equilibrium.

00:45:59.420 --> 00:46:02.846
With the exception of a few
dogged people who want to pay

00:46:02.846 --> 00:46:05.110
for my lunch,
almost everyone else was

00:46:05.110 --> 00:46:12.502
converging to an equilibrium.
So play converged fairly

00:46:12.502 --> 00:46:21.289
rapidly to the Nash Equilibrium.
But we discussed there were two

00:46:21.289 --> 00:46:23.925
Nash Equilibria in this game.;
Is one of these Nash

00:46:23.925 --> 00:46:27.446
Equilibria, ignoring me for a
second, is one of these Nash

00:46:27.446 --> 00:46:29.670
Equilibria better than the
other?

00:46:29.670 --> 00:46:32.398
Yeah, clearly the "everyone
investing" Nash Equilibrium is

00:46:32.398 --> 00:46:33.930
the better one,
is that right?

00:46:33.930 --> 00:46:36.302
Everyone agree?
Everyone investing is a better

00:46:36.302 --> 00:46:40.287
Nash Equilibrium for everyone in
the class, than everyone not

00:46:40.287 --> 00:46:43.326
investing, is that correct?
Nevertheless,

00:46:43.326 --> 00:46:47.190
where we were converging in
this case was what?

00:46:47.190 --> 00:46:50.760
Where we're converging was the
bad equilibrium.

00:46:50.760 --> 00:46:53.924
We were converging rapidly to a
very bad equilibrium,

00:46:53.924 --> 00:46:56.420
an equilibrium which no one
gets anything,

00:46:56.420 --> 00:46:59.220
which all that money is left on
the table.

00:46:59.220 --> 00:47:02.273
So how can that be?
How did we converge to this bad

00:47:02.273 --> 00:47:04.471
equilibrium?
To be a bit more formal,

00:47:04.471 --> 00:47:07.307
the bad equilibrium and no
invest equilibrium here,

00:47:07.307 --> 00:47:10.369
is pareto dominated by
the good equilibrium.

00:47:10.369 --> 00:47:13.991
Everybody is strictly better
off at the good equilibrium than

00:47:13.991 --> 00:47:17.168
the bad equilibrium.
It pareto dominates,

00:47:17.168 --> 00:47:21.070
to use an expression you
probably learned in 150 or 115.

00:47:21.070 --> 00:47:22.940
Nevertheless,
we're going to the bad one;

00:47:22.940 --> 00:47:24.380
we're heading to the bad
equilibrium.

00:47:24.380 --> 00:47:28.924
Why did we end up going to the
bad equilibrium rather than the

00:47:28.924 --> 00:47:34.579
good equilibrium?
Can we get the guy in the gray?

00:47:34.579 --> 00:47:37.460
Student: Well,
it was a bit of [inaudible]

00:47:37.460 --> 00:47:40.340
Professor Ben Polak:
Just now you mean?

00:47:40.340 --> 00:47:42.680
Say what you mean a bit more,
yeah that's good.

00:47:42.680 --> 00:47:47.320
Just say a bit more.
Student: So it seemed

00:47:47.320 --> 00:47:54.198
like people didn't have a lot of
confidence that other people

00:47:54.198 --> 00:47:58.365
were going to invest.
Professor Ben Polak: So

00:47:58.365 --> 00:48:01.242
one way of saying that was when
we started out we were roughly

00:48:01.242 --> 00:48:03.365
even,
roughly half/half but that was

00:48:03.365 --> 00:48:06.972
already bad for the people who
invested and then--so we started

00:48:06.972 --> 00:48:10.870
out at half/half which was below
that critical threshold of 90%,

00:48:10.870 --> 00:48:13.302
is that right?
From then on in,

00:48:13.302 --> 00:48:17.675
we just tumbled down.
So one way to say this--one way

00:48:17.675 --> 00:48:21.443
to think about that is it may
matter, in this case,

00:48:21.443 --> 00:48:24.810
where we started.
Suppose the first time we

00:48:24.810 --> 00:48:27.936
played the game in this class
this morning,

00:48:27.936 --> 00:48:31.360
suppose that 93% of the class
had invested.

00:48:31.360 --> 00:48:34.302
In which case,
those 93% would all have made

00:48:34.302 --> 00:48:36.791
money.
Now I'm--my guess is--I can't

00:48:36.791 --> 00:48:40.205
prove this, my guess is,
we might have converged the

00:48:40.205 --> 00:48:43.820
other way and converged up to
the good equilibrium.

00:48:43.820 --> 00:48:46.774
Does that make sense?
So people figured out that

00:48:46.774 --> 00:48:49.461
they--people who didn't invest
the first time--actually they

00:48:49.461 --> 00:48:52.239
played the best response to the
class, so they stayed put.

00:48:52.239 --> 00:48:54.458
And those of you did invest,
a lot of you started not

00:48:54.458 --> 00:48:56.847
investing as you caught up in
this spiral downward and we

00:48:56.847 --> 00:48:59.701
ended up not investing.
But had we started off above

00:48:59.701 --> 00:49:02.800
the critical threshold,
the threshold here is 90%,

00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:04.689
and had you made money the
first time around,

00:49:04.689 --> 00:49:07.094
then it would have been the
non-investors that would have

00:49:07.094 --> 00:49:09.412
regretted that choice and they
might have switched into

00:49:09.412 --> 00:49:11.198
investing,
and we might have--I'm not

00:49:11.198 --> 00:49:13.100
saying necessarily,
but we might have gone the

00:49:13.100 --> 00:49:15.289
other way.
Yeah, can we get a mike on?

00:49:15.289 --> 00:49:17.956
Student: What if it had
been like a 30/70 thing or

00:49:17.956 --> 00:49:19.766
[inaudible]
Professor Ben Polak:

00:49:19.766 --> 00:49:22.723
Yes, that's a good question.
Suppose we had been close to

00:49:22.723 --> 00:49:25.590
the threshold but below,
so I don't know is the answer.

00:49:25.590 --> 00:49:27.927
We didn't do the experiment but
it seems likely that the

00:49:27.927 --> 00:49:30.434
higher--the closer we got to the
threshold the better chance

00:49:30.434 --> 00:49:32.050
there would have been in going
up.

00:49:32.050 --> 00:49:34.765
My guess is--and this is a
guess--my guess is if we started

00:49:34.765 --> 00:49:37.059
below the threshold we probably
have come down,

00:49:37.059 --> 00:49:38.841
and if was from above the
threshold, we would probably

00:49:38.841 --> 00:49:40.219
have gone up,
but that's not a theorem.

00:49:40.219 --> 00:49:42.769
I'm just speculating on what
might have happened;

00:49:42.769 --> 00:49:45.949
speculating on your
speculations.

00:49:45.949 --> 00:49:48.392
So, here we have a game with
two equilibria,

00:49:48.392 --> 00:49:49.869
one is good,
one is bad;

00:49:49.869 --> 00:49:53.030
one is really quite bad,
its pareto dominated.

00:49:53.030 --> 00:49:56.378
Notice that what happened here,
the way we spiraled down

00:49:56.378 --> 00:49:59.969
coincides with something we've
talked about Nash Equilibrium

00:49:59.969 --> 00:50:04.155
already,
it coincides with this idea of

00:50:04.155 --> 00:50:09.422
a self-fulfilling prediction.
Provided you think other people

00:50:09.422 --> 00:50:12.519
are not going to invest,
you're not going to invest.

00:50:12.519 --> 00:50:15.576
So, it's a self-fulfilling
prediction to take you down to

00:50:15.576 --> 00:50:17.895
not investing.
Conversely, provided everyone

00:50:17.895 --> 00:50:21.034
thinks everyone else is going to
invest, then you're going to go

00:50:21.034 --> 00:50:23.869
up to the good equilibrium.
I think that corresponds to

00:50:23.869 --> 00:50:26.648
what the gentleman said in the
middle about a bare market

00:50:26.648 --> 00:50:28.730
versus a bull market.
If it was a bare market,

00:50:28.730 --> 00:50:30.697
it looked like everyone else
didn't have confidence in

00:50:30.697 --> 00:50:33.787
everyone else investing,
and then that was a

00:50:33.787 --> 00:50:40.489
self-fulfilling prophesy and we
ended up with no investment.

00:50:40.489 --> 00:50:43.730
Now, we've seen bad outcomes in
the class before.

00:50:43.730 --> 00:50:46.317
For example,
the very first day we saw a

00:50:46.317 --> 00:50:49.511
Prisoner's Dilemma.
But I claim that though we're

00:50:49.511 --> 00:50:52.803
getting a bad outcome here in
the class, this is not a

00:50:52.803 --> 00:50:56.864
Prisoner's Dilemma.
Why is this not a Prisoner's

00:50:56.864 --> 00:50:58.873
Dilemma?
What's different between--I

00:50:58.873 --> 00:51:00.989
mean both games have an
equilibrium which is bad.

00:51:00.989 --> 00:51:03.729
Prisoner's Dilemma has the bad
equilibrium when nobody tidies

00:51:03.729 --> 00:51:06.469
their room or both guys go to
jail, but I claim this is not a

00:51:06.469 --> 00:51:10.239
Prisoner's Dilemma.
Get the guy behind you.

00:51:10.239 --> 00:51:13.980
Student: No one suffered
but no one gets any payoffs.

00:51:13.980 --> 00:51:15.470
Professor Ben Polak:
Okay, so maybe the outcome isn't

00:51:15.470 --> 00:51:16.811
quite so bad.
That's fair enough,

00:51:16.811 --> 00:51:19.747
I could have made it worse,
I could have made it sort of--I

00:51:19.747 --> 00:51:22.733
could have made that--I could
have lowered the payoffs until

00:51:22.733 --> 00:51:24.730
they were pretty bad.
Why else is this not a

00:51:24.730 --> 00:51:27.719
Prisoner's Dilemma?
The woman who's behind you.

00:51:27.719 --> 00:51:29.670
Student: Because there's
no strictly dominated strategy.

00:51:29.670 --> 00:51:30.610
Professor Ben Polak:
Good;

00:51:30.610 --> 00:51:33.071
so in Prisoner's Dilemma
playing Î¬

00:51:33.071 --> 00:51:36.815
was always a best response.
What led us to the bad outcome

00:51:36.815 --> 00:51:40.610
in Prisoner's Dilemma was that
Î¬, the defense strategy,

00:51:40.610 --> 00:51:43.863
the non-cooperative strategy,
the not helping tidy your room

00:51:43.863 --> 00:51:46.289
strategy, was always the best
thing to do.

00:51:46.289 --> 00:51:49.977
Here, in some sense the "good
thing," the "moral thing" in

00:51:49.977 --> 00:51:53.470
some sense, is to invest but
it's not the case that not

00:51:53.470 --> 00:51:56.976
investing dominates investing.
In fact, if all the people

00:51:56.976 --> 00:51:59.739
invest in the room you ought to
invest, is that right?

00:51:59.739 --> 00:52:03.909
So this is a social problem,
but it's not a social problem

00:52:03.909 --> 00:52:06.690
of the form of a Prisoner's
Dilemma.

00:52:06.690 --> 00:52:11.155
So what kind of problem is this?
What kind of social problem is

00:52:11.155 --> 00:52:13.519
this?
The guy in front of you.

00:52:13.519 --> 00:52:15.980
Student: Perhaps it's
one of cooperation.

00:52:15.980 --> 00:52:16.739
Professor Ben Polak:
It's one of--okay.

00:52:16.739 --> 00:52:19.394
So it's--it would help if
people cooperated here but I'm

00:52:19.394 --> 00:52:26.084
looking for a different term.
The term that came up the first

00:52:26.084 --> 00:52:35.300
day--coordination,
this is a coordination game.

00:52:35.300 --> 00:52:39.652
For those people that read the
New Yorker,

00:52:39.652 --> 00:52:43.370
I'll put an umlaut over the
second "o."

00:52:43.370 --> 00:52:47.565
Why is it a coordination game?
Because you'd like everyone in

00:52:47.565 --> 00:52:51.960
the class to coordinate their
responses on invest.

00:52:51.960 --> 00:52:54.962
In fact, if they did that,
they all would be happy and no

00:52:54.962 --> 00:52:58.180
one would have an incentive to
defect and there would in fact

00:52:58.180 --> 00:53:00.206
be an equilibrium.
But unfortunately,

00:53:00.206 --> 00:53:02.230
quite often,
we fail to have coordination.

00:53:02.230 --> 00:53:05.245
Either everyone plays
non-invest or,

00:53:05.245 --> 00:53:10.242
as happened the first time in
class, we get some split with

00:53:10.242 --> 00:53:14.309
people losing money.
So, I claim that actually this

00:53:14.309 --> 00:53:16.909
is not a rare thing in society
at all.

00:53:16.909 --> 00:53:19.659
There are lots of coordination
problems in society.

00:53:19.659 --> 00:53:22.550
There are lots of things that
look like coordination games.

00:53:22.550 --> 00:53:26.182
And often, in coordination
games bad outcomes result and I

00:53:26.182 --> 00:53:30.070
want to spend most of the rest
of today talking about that,

00:53:30.070 --> 00:53:33.562
because I think it's important,
whether you're an economist or

00:53:33.562 --> 00:53:35.909
whatever, so let's talk about it
a bit.

00:53:35.909 --> 00:53:38.753
What else has the structure of
a coordination game,

00:53:38.753 --> 00:53:41.711
and therefore can have the
outcome that people can be

00:53:41.711 --> 00:53:44.840
uncoordinated or can coordinate
in the wrong place,

00:53:44.840 --> 00:53:47.610
and you end up with a bad
equilibrium?

00:53:47.610 --> 00:53:51.480
What else looks like that?
Let's collect some ideas.

00:53:51.480 --> 00:53:55.626
I got a hand way at the back.
Can you get the guy who is just

00:53:55.626 --> 00:53:58.791
way, way, way at the back,
right up against the--yes,

00:53:58.791 --> 00:54:00.800
there you go,
great thank you.

00:54:00.800 --> 00:54:03.219
Wait until the mike gets to you
and then yell.

00:54:03.219 --> 00:54:06.670
Student: A party on
campus is a coordination game.

00:54:06.670 --> 00:54:08.090
Professor Ben Polak:
Yeah, good okay.

00:54:08.090 --> 00:54:10.554
So a party on campus is a
coordination game because

00:54:10.554 --> 00:54:13.167
what--because you have to
coordinate being at the same

00:54:13.167 --> 00:54:16.180
place, is that right?
That's the idea you had?

00:54:16.180 --> 00:54:20.988
Go ahead.
Student: [inaudible]

00:54:20.988 --> 00:54:27.630
Professor Ben Polak:
Good, okay that's good.

00:54:27.630 --> 00:54:29.851
So that's another in
which--there's two ways in which

00:54:29.851 --> 00:54:31.559
a party can be a coordination
problem.

00:54:31.559 --> 00:54:33.751
One is the problem that if
people don't show up it's a

00:54:33.751 --> 00:54:35.570
lousy party, so you don't want
to show up.

00:54:35.570 --> 00:54:37.469
Conversely, if everyone is
showing up, it's great,

00:54:37.469 --> 00:54:39.097
it's a lot of fun,
it's the place to be and

00:54:39.097 --> 00:54:41.330
everyone wants to show up.
Second--so there's two

00:54:41.330 --> 00:54:43.519
equilibria there,
showing up and--everyone not

00:54:43.519 --> 00:54:45.320
showing up or everyone showing
up.

00:54:45.320 --> 00:54:47.314
Similar idea,
the location of parties which

00:54:47.314 --> 00:54:49.877
is what I thought you were
driving at, but this similar

00:54:49.877 --> 00:54:52.028
idea can occur.
So it used to the case in New

00:54:52.028 --> 00:54:54.310
Haven that there were
different--actually there aren't

00:54:54.310 --> 00:54:56.979
many anymore--but there used to
be different bars around campus

00:54:56.979 --> 00:54:58.960
(none of which you were allowed
to go to,

00:54:58.960 --> 00:55:01.021
so you don't know about) but
anyway, lots of different bars

00:55:01.021 --> 00:55:03.336
around campus.
And there's a coordination game

00:55:03.336 --> 00:55:06.322
where people coordinate on
Friday night--or to be more

00:55:06.322 --> 00:55:09.590
honest, the graduate students
typically Thursday night.

00:55:09.590 --> 00:55:11.788
So it used to be the case that
one of those bars downtown was

00:55:11.788 --> 00:55:13.400
where the drama school people
coordinated,

00:55:13.400 --> 00:55:16.539
and another one was where the
economists coordinated,

00:55:16.539 --> 00:55:19.557
and it was really good
equilibrium that they didn't

00:55:19.557 --> 00:55:22.965
coordinate at the same place.
So one of the things you have

00:55:22.965 --> 00:55:25.746
to learn when you go to a new
town is where is the meeting

00:55:25.746 --> 00:55:28.039
point for the kind of party I
want to go to.

00:55:28.039 --> 00:55:32.666
Again, you're going to have a
failure of coordination,

00:55:32.666 --> 00:55:37.380
everyone's wandering around the
town getting mugged.

00:55:37.380 --> 00:55:39.559
What other things look like
coordination problems like that?

00:55:39.559 --> 00:55:44.267
Again, way back in the corner
there, right behind you,

00:55:44.267 --> 00:55:47.255
there you go.
Student: Maybe warring

00:55:47.255 --> 00:55:49.710
parties in the Civil War signing
a treaty.

00:55:49.710 --> 00:55:51.452
Professor Ben Polak:
Okay, that could be a--that

00:55:51.452 --> 00:55:54.460
could be a coordination problem.
It has a feeling of being a bit

00:55:54.460 --> 00:55:58.219
Prisoner's Dilemmerish and in
some sense, it's my disarming,

00:55:58.219 --> 00:56:00.397
my putting down my arms before
you putting down your arms,

00:56:00.397 --> 00:56:02.422
that kind of thing.
So it could be a coordination

00:56:02.422 --> 00:56:04.700
problem, but it has a little bit
of a flavor of both.

00:56:04.700 --> 00:56:11.300
Go ahead, go on.
Okay, other examples?

00:56:11.300 --> 00:56:14.228
There's a guy there.
While you're there why don't

00:56:14.228 --> 00:56:16.932
you get the guy who is behind
you right there by the door,

00:56:16.932 --> 00:56:18.448
great.
Student: Big sports

00:56:18.448 --> 00:56:20.833
arena, people deciding whether
or not they want to start a

00:56:20.833 --> 00:56:22.800
chant or [inaudible]
Professor Ben Polak:

00:56:22.800 --> 00:56:24.661
Yeah, okay.
I'm not quite sure which is the

00:56:24.661 --> 00:56:27.335
good outcome or the bad outcome.
So there's this thing called,

00:56:27.335 --> 00:56:29.519
The Wave.
There's this thing called The

00:56:29.519 --> 00:56:32.917
Wave that Americans insist on
doing, and I guess they think

00:56:32.917 --> 00:56:41.750
that's the good outcome.
Other things?

00:56:41.750 --> 00:56:43.500
Student: Battle of the
sexes.

00:56:43.500 --> 00:56:44.869
Professor Ben Polak:
Let's come back to that one.

00:56:44.869 --> 00:56:46.739
Hold that thought and we'll
come back to it next time.

00:56:46.739 --> 00:56:50.560
You're right that's a good--but
let's come back to it next time.

00:56:50.560 --> 00:56:54.891
Anything else?
Let me try and expand on some

00:56:54.891 --> 00:56:58.339
of these meeting place ideas.
We talked about pubs to meet

00:56:58.339 --> 00:57:01.820
at, or parties to meet at,
but think about online sites.

00:57:01.820 --> 00:57:04.448
Online sites which are chat
sites or dating sites,

00:57:04.448 --> 00:57:07.266
or whatever.
Those are--those online sites

00:57:07.266 --> 00:57:10.260
clearly have the same feature of
a party.

00:57:10.260 --> 00:57:15.369
You want people to coordinate
on the same site.

00:57:15.369 --> 00:57:17.469
What about some other economic
ideas?

00:57:17.469 --> 00:57:20.500
What about some other ideas
from economics?

00:57:20.500 --> 00:57:26.922
What else has that kind of
externality like a meeting

00:57:26.922 --> 00:57:29.472
place?
Student: I mean it's

00:57:29.472 --> 00:57:32.425
excluding some people,
but things like newspapers or

00:57:32.425 --> 00:57:36.130
something, like we might want
only one like global news site.

00:57:36.130 --> 00:57:37.799
Professor Ben Polak: So,
that's an interesting thought,

00:57:37.799 --> 00:57:40.208
because it can go both ways.
It could be a bad thing to have

00:57:40.208 --> 00:57:43.079
one newspaper for obvious
reasons, but in terms of having

00:57:43.079 --> 00:57:46.154
a good conversation about what
was in the newspaper yesterday

00:57:46.154 --> 00:57:48.556
around the--over lunch,
it helps that everyone's read

00:57:48.556 --> 00:57:50.454
the same thing.
Certainly, there's a bandwagon

00:57:50.454 --> 00:57:53.396
effect to this with TV shows.
If everybody in America watches

00:57:53.396 --> 00:57:55.685
the same TV show,
which apparently is American

00:57:55.685 --> 00:57:58.076
Idol these days,
then you can also talk about it

00:57:58.076 --> 00:58:01.823
over lunch.
Notice that's a really horrible

00:58:01.823 --> 00:58:04.969
place to coordinate.
There are similar examples to

00:58:04.969 --> 00:58:07.504
the American Idol example.
When I was growing up in

00:58:07.504 --> 00:58:10.110
England, again I'm going to
reveal my age;

00:58:10.110 --> 00:58:14.043
everybody decided that to be an
"in" person in England,

00:58:14.043 --> 00:58:16.519
you had to wear flared
trousers.

00:58:16.519 --> 00:58:19.320
This was--and so to be in you
had to wear flared trousers.

00:58:19.320 --> 00:58:23.889
This is a horrible coordination
problem, right?

00:58:23.889 --> 00:58:26.226
So for people who don't believe
that could ever have happened in

00:58:26.226 --> 00:58:28.414
England that you could ever
these sort of fashion goods that

00:58:28.414 --> 00:58:30.639
you end up at a horrible
equilibrium at the wrong place,

00:58:30.639 --> 00:58:35.576
if you don't believe that could
ever happen think about the

00:58:35.576 --> 00:58:39.520
entirety of the Midwest.
I didn't say that,

00:58:39.520 --> 00:58:44.040
we're going to cut that out of
the film later.

00:58:44.040 --> 00:58:48.542
What else is like this?
I'm going to get a few ideas

00:58:48.542 --> 00:58:50.883
now, this gentleman here.
Student: The

00:58:50.883 --> 00:58:53.355
establishment of monopolies,
because a lot of people use

00:58:53.355 --> 00:58:54.988
Microsoft,
say then everything is

00:58:54.988 --> 00:58:57.610
compatible with Microsoft so
more people would use it.

00:58:57.610 --> 00:58:59.310
Professor Ben Polak:
Good, I've forgotten your name.

00:58:59.310 --> 00:59:01.438
Student: Steven.
Professor Ben Polak: So,

00:59:01.438 --> 00:59:04.061
Steven's pointing out that
certain software can act this

00:59:04.061 --> 00:59:07.007
way by being a network good.
The more people who use

00:59:07.007 --> 00:59:10.006
Microsoft and Microsoft
programs, the bigger the

00:59:10.006 --> 00:59:13.627
advantage to me using Microsoft,
and therefore--because I can

00:59:13.627 --> 00:59:15.857
exchange programs,
I can exchange files if I'm

00:59:15.857 --> 00:59:17.840
working with my co-authors and
so on,

00:59:17.840 --> 00:59:20.799
and so you can have different
equilibria coordinating on

00:59:20.799 --> 00:59:23.050
different software,
and again, you could end up at

00:59:23.050 --> 00:59:24.850
the wrong one.
I think a lot of people would

00:59:24.850 --> 00:59:27.416
argue--but I'm going to stay
neutral on this--a lot of people

00:59:27.416 --> 00:59:29.683
would argue that Microsoft
wasn't necessarily the best

00:59:29.683 --> 00:59:32.506
place for the world to end up.
There are other technological

00:59:32.506 --> 00:59:34.671
network goods like this.
These are called network

00:59:34.671 --> 00:59:37.072
externalities.
An example here would be high

00:59:37.072 --> 00:59:39.415
definition television.
You want to have one

00:59:39.415 --> 00:59:42.063
technological standard that
everyone agrees on for things

00:59:42.063 --> 00:59:44.759
like high definition televisions
because then everyone can

00:59:44.759 --> 00:59:47.643
produce TVs to that standard and
goods that go along with that

00:59:47.643 --> 00:59:50.090
standard,
and of course it--each company

00:59:50.090 --> 00:59:53.527
who's producing a TV and has a
standard line would like theirs

00:59:53.527 --> 00:59:56.767
to be chosen as the standard.
Again, you could end up at the

00:59:56.767 --> 00:59:59.745
wrong place.
You could end up with a bad

00:59:59.745 --> 01:00:02.929
equilibrium.
How about political bandwagons?

01:00:02.929 --> 01:00:04.945
In politics,
particularly in primaries,

01:00:04.945 --> 01:00:07.809
there may be advantage on the
Democratic side or on the

01:00:07.809 --> 01:00:10.149
Republican side,
in having you all vote for the

01:00:10.149 --> 01:00:12.709
same candidate in the primary,
so they get this big boost and

01:00:12.709 --> 01:00:14.969
it doesn't seem like your
party's split and so on.

01:00:14.969 --> 01:00:17.374
And that could end up--and
again, I'm going to remain

01:00:17.374 --> 01:00:20.195
neutral on this--it just could
end up with the wrong candidate

01:00:20.195 --> 01:00:22.538
winning.
There's a political bandwagon

01:00:22.538 --> 01:00:26.424
effect, the person who wins New
Hampshire and Iowa tends then to

01:00:26.424 --> 01:00:29.200
win everything,
so that's another example.

01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:37.950
Any other economic examples?
Can we get this guy in here?

01:00:37.950 --> 01:00:41.192
Student: Stock exchange.
Professor Ben Polak:

01:00:41.192 --> 01:00:43.840
Yeah, okay, so in particular
which stock exchange to list on.

01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:46.597
So there's a huge advantage
having lots of stocks in the

01:00:46.597 --> 01:00:49.010
same stock exchange.
There are shared fixed costs;

01:00:49.010 --> 01:00:52.820
there's also liquidity issues
and lots of issues of that form

01:00:52.820 --> 01:00:55.170
but mostly the form of fixed
costs.

01:00:55.170 --> 01:00:58.239
So there's a tendency to end up
with one stock exchange.

01:00:58.239 --> 01:01:01.094
We're not there yet but we do
seem to be going that way quite

01:01:01.094 --> 01:01:02.899
rapidly.
The problem of course being,

01:01:02.899 --> 01:01:05.605
that might not be the best
stock exchange or it might give

01:01:05.605 --> 01:01:07.409
that stock exchange monopoly
power.

01:01:07.409 --> 01:01:10.550
Let me give one--let me try one
more example.

01:01:10.550 --> 01:01:18.370
What about bank runs?
What's a bank run?

01:01:18.370 --> 01:01:25.242
Somebody--what's a bank run?
Student: It's when the

01:01:25.242 --> 01:01:30.358
public loses confidence
in--because their security of

01:01:30.358 --> 01:01:34.982
their money in banks,
then they rush to withdraw

01:01:34.982 --> 01:01:37.342
their deposits.
Professor Ben Polak:

01:01:37.342 --> 01:01:38.909
Good.
So you can imagine a bank as a

01:01:38.909 --> 01:01:41.030
natural case where there's two
equilibria.

01:01:41.030 --> 01:01:43.663
There's a good equilibrium,
everyone has confidence in the

01:01:43.663 --> 01:01:46.019
bank, everyone leaves their
deposits in the bank.

01:01:46.019 --> 01:01:48.889
The bank is then able to lend
some of that money out on a

01:01:48.889 --> 01:01:51.617
higher rate of interest on it.
The bank doesn't want to keep

01:01:51.617 --> 01:01:53.079
all that money locked up in the
vault.

01:01:53.079 --> 01:01:56.989
It wants to lend it out to
lenders who can pay interest.

01:01:56.989 --> 01:01:59.559
That's a good equilibrium for
everybody.

01:01:59.559 --> 01:02:02.763
However, if people lose
confidence in the bank and start

01:02:02.763 --> 01:02:06.375
drawing their deposits out then
the bank hasn't got enough cash

01:02:06.375 --> 01:02:09.520
in its vaults to cover those
deposits and the bank goes

01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:11.589
under.
Now, I used to say at this

01:02:11.589 --> 01:02:14.224
point in the class,
none of you will have ever seen

01:02:14.224 --> 01:02:17.332
a bank run because they stopped
happening in America more or

01:02:17.332 --> 01:02:20.054
less in the mid 30s.
There were lots and lots of

01:02:20.054 --> 01:02:23.329
bank runs in America before the
1930s, but since federal deposit

01:02:23.329 --> 01:02:25.409
insurance came in,
there's far fewer.

01:02:25.409 --> 01:02:28.354
However, I really can't say
that today because there's a

01:02:28.354 --> 01:02:31.140
bank run going on right now.
There's as bank run going on

01:02:31.140 --> 01:02:33.205
actually in England with a
company called Northern

01:02:33.205 --> 01:02:35.346
Security--no,
Northern Rock--it's called

01:02:35.346 --> 01:02:36.812
Northern Rock,
as we speak,

01:02:36.812 --> 01:02:39.970
and it really is a bank run.
I mean, if you looked at the

01:02:39.970 --> 01:02:42.489
newspaper yesterday on The
New York Times,

01:02:42.489 --> 01:02:46.232
you'll see a line of depositors
lined up, outside the offices in

01:02:46.232 --> 01:02:48.982
London of this bank,
trying to get their deposits

01:02:48.982 --> 01:02:50.756
out.
And you see the Bank of England

01:02:50.756 --> 01:02:52.860
trying to intervene to restore
confidence.

01:02:52.860 --> 01:02:54.980
Just be clear,
this isn't simple--this isn't a

01:02:54.980 --> 01:02:57.289
simple case of being about the
mortgage crisis.

01:02:57.289 --> 01:02:59.276
This bank does do mortgages but
it doesn't seem to be

01:02:59.276 --> 01:03:01.569
particularly involved in the
kind of mortgages that have been

01:03:01.569 --> 01:03:04.622
attracting all the publicity.
It really seems to be a shift

01:03:04.622 --> 01:03:07.031
in confidence.
A move from the good

01:03:07.031 --> 01:03:10.142
equilibrium of everyone
remaining invested,

01:03:10.142 --> 01:03:14.659
to the bad equilibrium of
everyone taking their money out.

01:03:14.659 --> 01:03:18.981
Now, there are famous bank runs
in American culture,

01:03:18.981 --> 01:03:22.913
in the movies anyway.
What is the famous bank run in

01:03:22.913 --> 01:03:25.435
the movies, in American movies?
Student: It's a

01:03:25.435 --> 01:03:26.314
Wonderful Life.
Professor Ben Polak:

01:03:26.314 --> 01:03:27.694
It's a Wonderful Life;
there's actually--there's one

01:03:27.694 --> 01:03:29.090
in Mary Poppins as well,
but we'll do It's a

01:03:29.090 --> 01:03:31.115
Wonderful Life.
How many of you have seen

01:03:31.115 --> 01:03:33.574
It's A Wonderful Life?
How many have you not seen

01:03:33.574 --> 01:03:35.510
It's a Wonderful Life?
Let me get a poll here.

01:03:35.510 --> 01:03:37.465
How many people have not
seen--keep your hands up a

01:03:37.465 --> 01:03:40.669
second, keep your hands up.
You need to know that if you're

01:03:40.669 --> 01:03:43.808
on a green card,
you can lose your green card if

01:03:43.808 --> 01:03:47.079
you haven't sent It's a
Wonderful Life.

01:03:47.079 --> 01:03:49.545
So, in It's a Wonderful
Life there's a run on the

01:03:49.545 --> 01:03:52.100
bank--actually it's a savings
and loan, but never mind.

01:03:52.100 --> 01:03:56.308
We'll think of it as a bank.
Luckily, it doesn't end up with

01:03:56.308 --> 01:03:59.400
the savings or loan,
or bank, going under.

01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:04.740
Why doesn't the bank go under
in It's a Wonderful Life?

01:04:04.740 --> 01:04:07.550
Why doesn't it go under?
Yeah, the guy in green?

01:04:07.550 --> 01:04:15.104
Can we get the guy in green?
Student: Everyone agrees

01:04:15.104 --> 01:04:17.226
to only take as much as they
need [inaudible]

01:04:17.226 --> 01:04:20.360
Professor Ben Polak: For
the people who didn't hear it,

01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:23.124
everyone agrees only to take
out a small amount,

01:04:23.124 --> 01:04:26.360
perhaps even nothing and
therefore the bank run ends.

01:04:26.360 --> 01:04:28.141
Everyone realizes the bank
isn't going to collapse,

01:04:28.141 --> 01:04:30.030
and they're happy to leave
their money in the bank.

01:04:30.030 --> 01:04:32.470
Now, it's true everyone agrees
but what do they agree?

01:04:32.470 --> 01:04:38.039
What makes them agree?
What makes them agree is Jimmy

01:04:38.039 --> 01:04:40.340
Stewart, right?
Everyone remember the movie?

01:04:40.340 --> 01:04:43.269
So Jimmy Stewart gets up there
and he says--he gives a speech,

01:04:43.269 --> 01:04:44.230
and he says,
look,

01:04:44.230 --> 01:04:45.911
more or less,--I mean he
doesn't say it in these words

01:04:45.911 --> 01:04:47.909
but he would have done it if he
had taken the class--he says,

01:04:47.909 --> 01:04:52.059
look there are two equilibria
in this game.

01:04:52.059 --> 01:04:54.328
(I can't do the--whatever it
is, the West Pennsylvania

01:04:54.328 --> 01:04:56.940
accent, is that what it is,
or whatever it is.) But anyway;

01:04:56.940 --> 01:04:58.010
there are two equilibria in
this game;

01:04:58.010 --> 01:05:00.336
there's a bad one where we all
draw our money out and we all

01:05:00.336 --> 01:05:02.434
lose our homes eventually,
and there's a good one where we

01:05:02.434 --> 01:05:04.230
all leave our money in and
that's better for everyone.,

01:05:04.230 --> 01:05:07.993
So let's all leave our money in.
But he gives this--he's a bit

01:05:07.993 --> 01:05:12.211
more motivationally stimulating
than me--but he leads people

01:05:12.211 --> 01:05:15.552
leaving their money in.
So, what I want to do is,

01:05:15.552 --> 01:05:18.637
I want to pick on somebody in
the class now--everyone

01:05:18.637 --> 01:05:21.124
understands this game,
everyone understands there's

01:05:21.124 --> 01:05:22.703
two equilibria,
everyone understands that one

01:05:22.703 --> 01:05:24.610
equilibrium is better.
Let's play the game again.

01:05:24.610 --> 01:05:28.493
Let's choose the game again,
but before I do I'm going to

01:05:28.493 --> 01:05:32.446
give the mike to Patrick here
and Patrick is going to have

01:05:32.446 --> 01:05:35.290
exactly five seconds to persuade
you.

01:05:35.290 --> 01:05:38.285
Stand up.
Patrick's going to have five

01:05:38.285 --> 01:05:41.348
seconds to persuade you to tell
you whatever he likes starting

01:05:41.348 --> 01:05:42.710
now.
Student: Okay,

01:05:42.710 --> 01:05:45.165
so clearly if we all invest
we're always better off,

01:05:45.165 --> 01:05:47.382
so everybody should invest.
Professor Ben Polak: All

01:05:47.382 --> 01:05:48.480
right, now let's see if this is
going work.

01:05:48.480 --> 01:05:55.429
Okay, so let's see what happens
now.

01:05:55.429 --> 01:06:00.709
Everybody who is going to
invest raise their hands and

01:06:00.709 --> 01:06:05.590
everyone who's not investing
raise their hands.

01:06:05.590 --> 01:06:08.360
Oh we almost made it.
We must have almost made it.

01:06:08.360 --> 01:06:11.596
So notice what happened here.
Give another round of applause

01:06:11.596 --> 01:06:18.090
for Patrick.
I think he did a good job there.

01:06:18.090 --> 01:06:21.927
But there's a lesson here;
the lesson here is the game

01:06:21.927 --> 01:06:24.309
didn't change.
It's the same game that we've

01:06:24.309 --> 01:06:26.902
played three times already.
This was the fourth time we've

01:06:26.902 --> 01:06:28.795
played it.
We had a totally different

01:06:28.795 --> 01:06:31.567
response in playing this time.
Almost all of you,

01:06:31.567 --> 01:06:34.332
the vast majority of you,
perhaps even 90% of you

01:06:34.332 --> 01:06:37.789
invested this time and you did
so in response to Patrick.

01:06:37.789 --> 01:06:40.087
But Patrick wasn't putting any
money down, he wasn't bribing

01:06:40.087 --> 01:06:41.840
you, he wasn't writing a
contract with you,

01:06:41.840 --> 01:06:45.289
he wasn't threatening to break
your legs, he just was pointing

01:06:45.289 --> 01:06:47.920
out it's a good idea.
Now, remember the Prisoner's

01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:50.487
Dilemma, in the Prisoner's
Dilemma, if Patrick--Patrick

01:06:50.487 --> 01:06:53.148
could have got up in the
Prisoner's Dilemma and given the

01:06:53.148 --> 01:06:56.510
same speech and said look guys,
we're all better off if we

01:06:56.510 --> 01:06:59.239
choose Î²
in the Prisoner's Dilemma than

01:06:59.239 --> 01:07:02.570
if we choose Î¬;
roughly the same speech.

01:07:02.570 --> 01:07:06.199
What will you have done in the
Prisoner's Dilemma?

01:07:06.199 --> 01:07:08.550
You would have all chosen
Î¬ anyway.

01:07:08.550 --> 01:07:12.482
So Patrick tried to persuade
you, or Patrick communicating to

01:07:12.482 --> 01:07:15.104
you that you do better by
choosing Î²

01:07:15.104 --> 01:07:18.774
in the Prisoner's Dilemma
doesn't work but here--don't go

01:07:18.774 --> 01:07:20.809
yet.
Here it does work.

01:07:20.809 --> 01:07:25.682
Why does Patrick--why is
Patrick persuasive in this game

01:07:25.682 --> 01:07:30.289
but he isn't persuasive in the
Prisoner's Dilemma?

01:07:30.289 --> 01:07:34.090
Can we get the mike on Katie
again?

01:07:34.090 --> 01:07:35.949
Why is Patrick persuasive in
this game and not before?

01:07:35.949 --> 01:07:38.424
Student: He's not trying
to get you to play a strictly

01:07:38.424 --> 01:07:39.981
dominated strategy.
Professor Ben Polak:

01:07:39.981 --> 01:07:41.516
He's not trying to get you play
a strictly dominated strategy

01:07:41.516 --> 01:07:44.136
and more than that,
he's trying to persuade you to

01:07:44.136 --> 01:07:47.570
play what?
To play a Nash Equilibrium.

01:07:47.570 --> 01:07:52.024
So, there's a lesson here,
in coordination problems,

01:07:52.024 --> 01:07:56.673
unlike Prisoner's Dilemma,
communication--just

01:07:56.673 --> 01:08:01.892
communication,
no contracts--communication can

01:08:01.892 --> 01:08:04.169
help.
And in particular,

01:08:04.169 --> 01:08:08.815
what we can persuade each other
to do is to play the other Nash

01:08:08.815 --> 01:08:11.816
Equilibrium.
Now, this gives us one more

01:08:11.816 --> 01:08:14.250
motivation for a Nash
Equilibrium.

01:08:14.250 --> 01:08:17.205
In a Prisoner's Dilemma,
to get out of it we needed a

01:08:17.205 --> 01:08:20.218
contract, we needed side
payments, we needed to change

01:08:20.218 --> 01:08:29.396
the payoffs of the game.
But a Nash Equilibrium can be a

01:08:29.396 --> 01:08:37.694
self-enforcing agreement.
We can agree that we're going

01:08:37.694 --> 01:08:41.564
to play invest in this game,
and indeed we will play invest

01:08:41.564 --> 01:08:44.668
without any side payments,
without anybody threatening to

01:08:44.668 --> 01:08:46.109
break your leg,
without any contracts,

01:08:46.109 --> 01:08:47.550
without any regulation or the
law.

01:08:47.550 --> 01:08:49.729
I'm assuming Patrick isn't that
violent.

01:08:49.729 --> 01:08:55.510
We're going to end up doing the
right thing here because it's in

01:08:55.510 --> 01:08:59.870
our own interest to do so.
So coordination problems which

01:08:59.870 --> 01:09:03.032
we've agreed are all over
society, whether it comes to

01:09:03.032 --> 01:09:05.300
bank runs or bubbles in the
market,

01:09:05.300 --> 01:09:08.840
or fashion in the Midwest,
they're all over society.

01:09:08.840 --> 01:09:12.555
Communication can make a
difference and we'll pick that

01:09:12.555 --> 01:09:13.888
theme up on Monday.

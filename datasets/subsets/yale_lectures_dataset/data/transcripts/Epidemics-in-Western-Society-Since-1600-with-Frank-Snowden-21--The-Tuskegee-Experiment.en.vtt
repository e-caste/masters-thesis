00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.180
Professional Frank Snowden:
This morning I want in a

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.219
way to circle back in time to
cover an issue that's been

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:14.700
lurking in the background but
we've never faced directly.

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.151
You will remember that when we
talked about the Paris School of

00:00:18.151 --> 00:00:21.144
Medicine,
there was the ethical issue

00:00:21.144 --> 00:00:26.222
raised of the relationship of
the patients to the physicians

00:00:26.222 --> 00:00:30.010
who were using them for medical
studies,

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:33.754
and we've talked about this as
well in a variety of other

00:00:33.754 --> 00:00:34.490
contexts.
 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:37.670
For example,
in the breakthrough of the

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.525
mosquito theory of transmission
of malaria, we've seen that

00:00:42.525 --> 00:00:46.710
there were human experiments
involved in that.

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.496
But there wasn't really an
ethical framework of a formal

00:00:51.496 --> 00:00:55.500
kind until well into the
twentieth century,

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.960
and it's that development that
I want to look at this morning--

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.733
the development of a framework
of bioethical experimentation

00:01:05.733 --> 00:01:09.846
for human studies--
and to do that,

00:01:09.846 --> 00:01:16.839
I'd like to look at the
Tuskegee syphilis study from

00:01:16.839 --> 00:01:21.232
1932 to 1972,
which was, if we like,

00:01:21.232 --> 00:01:26.575
the catalyst around which a
framework of biomedical ethics

00:01:26.575 --> 00:01:28.170
was developed.
 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:34.060
Now, the Tuskegee study was a
complex story.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:40.616
It captured the national
imagination, because it seemed

00:01:40.616 --> 00:01:48.144
to embody everybody's fears as a
worst-case scenario in medical

00:01:48.144 --> 00:01:49.480
ethics.
 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:54.900
Tuskegee as a study embodied a
number of features that

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.150
contributed to that.
 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:01.790
Clearly it demonstrates,
as I think we'll see,

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:07.462
the corrupting influence of
commercial considerations on

00:02:07.462 --> 00:02:10.968
medicine and medical research.
 

00:02:10.968 --> 00:02:20.068
It demonstrates the negative
impacts of scientific arrogance.

00:02:20.068 --> 00:02:27.104
It brings out the dangers of a
military chain of command model

00:02:27.104 --> 00:02:32.294
of public health,
in which no one questions or

00:02:32.294 --> 00:02:37.370
resists decisions from higher
authority.

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:44.031
It shows the exploitation of
the poor and disadvantaged by

00:02:44.031 --> 00:02:50.692
powerful interests and the
government, and it also clearly

00:02:50.692 --> 00:02:53.030
embodies racism.
 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:58.366
This is an experiment that
began with an idea that racial

00:02:58.366 --> 00:03:02.560
groups are a serious biological
category,

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.909
not just a social one,
but that races are biological

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:12.006
entities,
and that the differences from

00:03:12.006 --> 00:03:17.091
one group to another are so
significant that diseases

00:03:17.091 --> 00:03:22.860
themselves follow different
paths in the bodies of different

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.720
racial groups.
 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:34.035
Well, the place where this
unfolded was in Macon County,

00:03:34.035 --> 00:03:41.486
Alabama in the 1930s,
and Tuskegee is here in

00:03:41.486 --> 00:03:43.520
Alabama.
 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.139
Let me look a little more
closely.

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:52.970
That's Macon County in the
state of Alabama.

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:57.634
There are a number of features
we need to think about when we

00:03:57.634 --> 00:04:01.948
remember Macon County,
and we need to take off our

00:04:01.948 --> 00:04:07.211
twenty-first century spectacles
and think back to a different

00:04:07.211 --> 00:04:12.074
world in the 1930s,
when this experiment got

00:04:12.074 --> 00:04:13.258
underway.
 

00:04:13.258 --> 00:04:16.970
And at that time,
Macon County was one of the

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:22.199
most disadvantaged places in the
whole of the United States.

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:26.762
It had a large population of
poor and illiterate

00:04:26.762 --> 00:04:32.103
African-American sharecroppers,
and this was the time of

00:04:32.103 --> 00:04:34.920
apartheid in our country.
 

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:40.185
Studies had revealed in
connection with the social

00:04:40.185 --> 00:04:46.850
conditions of the sharecroppers
in Macon County an overwhelming

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:50.720
burden of disease and suffering.
 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.394
In a rigidly segregated
environment, the

00:04:54.394 --> 00:05:00.519
African-American population was
also overwhelmingly illiterate.

00:05:00.519 --> 00:05:07.040
In fact, the state of Alabama
spent sixty-five dollars a year

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:11.278
on each white student in the
county,

00:05:11.278 --> 00:05:18.509
but less than seven dollars for
every African-American student.

00:05:18.509 --> 00:05:23.345
Venereal diseases,
and especially syphilis,

00:05:23.345 --> 00:05:27.490
were also rampant in Macon
County.

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:31.833
Well, the story that unfolds is
a pretty awful one,

00:05:31.833 --> 00:05:36.350
but paradoxically,
it begins with good intentions.

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:41.262
The good intentions were those
of a philanthropic program

00:05:41.262 --> 00:05:45.384
established by an
organization--I guess we would

00:05:45.384 --> 00:05:49.420
call it an NGO--the Julius
Rosenwald Fund.

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:54.345
Rosenwald at the time was the
president of the Sears &amp;

00:05:54.345 --> 00:05:57.887
Roebuck Company,
and under these auspices,

00:05:57.887 --> 00:05:58.579
Dr.
 

00:05:58.579 --> 00:06:05.141
Thomas Parran conducted a study
of syphilis in the south in 1929

00:06:05.141 --> 00:06:10.560
and '30, and this study had a
clear moral purpose.

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:14.940
The idea was that it was to
begin by demonstrating the

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:19.526
burden of syphilis,
and that this would be a first

00:06:19.526 --> 00:06:24.507
step that would pave the way for
the federal government

00:06:24.507 --> 00:06:29.673
subsequently to step in and
establish a national syphilis

00:06:29.673 --> 00:06:31.980
eradication program.
 

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:35.057
The vision was this:
in year one,

00:06:35.057 --> 00:06:40.637
there would be a Wasserman test
survey of six states in the

00:06:40.637 --> 00:06:46.163
south of this country;
that is, establishing the

00:06:46.163 --> 00:06:50.639
extent, the prevalence,
of syphilis.

00:06:50.639 --> 00:06:55.540
In the second year,
there would begin a program of

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:58.440
treatment and of education.
 

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:03.379
Let's look at what was found in
the beginning of the study year

00:07:03.379 --> 00:07:08.730
one was actually completed,
and it found that the United

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:15.288
States had a national rate for
syphilis of 4 for every 1,000 of

00:07:15.288 --> 00:07:16.769
population.
 

00:07:16.769 --> 00:07:23.413
On the other hand,
for African-Americans,

00:07:23.413 --> 00:07:31.718
the rate was 7.2 for every
1,000 of population were

00:07:31.718 --> 00:07:34.209
syphilitic.
 

00:07:34.209 --> 00:07:38.107
But if we come now to Macon
County, Alabama,

00:07:38.107 --> 00:07:42.730
and that's the point,
the statistics were absolutely

00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:44.089
staggering.
 

00:07:44.089 --> 00:07:48.430
Fully 360--and no,
I'm not making a mistake--

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:53.774
360 per 1,000 of population of
the African-American population

00:07:53.774 --> 00:07:58.286
of Macon County,
Alabama was found to be

00:07:58.286 --> 00:08:01.379
afflicted with syphilis.
 

00:08:01.379 --> 00:08:03.860
So, Macon County--and this is
the point--

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:10.541
was clearly placed on the map
as the very ideal place if you

00:08:10.541 --> 00:08:16.545
were interested in how syphilis
affected the bodies of

00:08:16.545 --> 00:08:20.973
African-Americans,
and particular,

00:08:20.973 --> 00:08:23.889
African-American males.
 

00:08:23.889 --> 00:08:30.519
Well, the year two of the
philanthropic program never got

00:08:30.519 --> 00:08:31.939
under way.
 

00:08:31.939 --> 00:08:36.804
The reason was simple:
it was the Great Depression,

00:08:36.804 --> 00:08:40.600
and funding for the program
vanished.

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:45.254
The phase that had been
intended of education,

00:08:45.254 --> 00:08:49.600
of treatment,
and hopefully of eradication,

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:51.980
never materialized.
 

00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:57.538
What remained was only the
initial study.

00:08:57.538 --> 00:09:03.801
At this point in the wake of
the activity of the Rosenwald

00:09:03.801 --> 00:09:06.941
Fund,
United States Public Health

00:09:06.941 --> 00:09:11.515
Service intervened,
and it had, as we'll see,

00:09:11.515 --> 00:09:15.009
two very different objectives.
 

00:09:15.009 --> 00:09:23.296
The first was associated with
this man, and the idea of the

00:09:23.296 --> 00:09:28.440
syphilis study was his
brainchild.

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:35.809
This is Tagliaferro Clark,
and his idea was to have a

00:09:35.809 --> 00:09:40.629
scientific and racial curiosity.
 

00:09:40.629 --> 00:09:45.817
There had been at the turn of
the century a Scandinavian study

00:09:45.817 --> 00:09:50.580
on the course of untreated
syphilis in the human body.

00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:55.457
That was conducted in
Scandinavia, and Dr. Clark

00:09:55.457 --> 00:10:01.166
thought that since the early
study had involved a Nordic

00:10:01.166 --> 00:10:04.828
people,
it would be really intriguing,

00:10:04.828 --> 00:10:08.794
really neat,
to do a companion study to show

00:10:08.794 --> 00:10:14.381
the natural history of syphilis
untreated in the body of the

00:10:14.381 --> 00:10:16.750
African-American male.
 

00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:20.820
And if you wanted to do that
kind of study in this country,

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:25.850
what place could possibly be
better than Macon County,

00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:30.350
which offered unlimited
material for just such

00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:31.850
observations.
 

00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:37.667
Clark started with a profoundly
racist hypothesis that he wished

00:10:37.667 --> 00:10:41.673
to demonstrate,
and that is the simple one that

00:10:41.673 --> 00:10:46.288
the African-American male was
racially distinct from the white

00:10:46.288 --> 00:10:49.697
male,
and was so in ways that could

00:10:49.697 --> 00:10:55.434
be demonstrated by studying the
natural history of syphilis in

00:10:55.434 --> 00:10:56.940
their bodies.
 

00:10:56.940 --> 00:11:00.139
It was thought,
or at least he thought,

00:11:00.139 --> 00:11:04.946
that African-American men had
such a high incidence of

00:11:04.946 --> 00:11:09.116
syphilis because of their
irresistible furor

00:11:09.116 --> 00:11:13.522
sexualis,
and their deficient cranial

00:11:13.522 --> 00:11:18.965
capacity that didn't really
leave enough room for gray

00:11:18.965 --> 00:11:21.428
matter to control it.
 

00:11:21.428 --> 00:11:27.655
Secondly, once established in
the body of the African-American

00:11:27.655 --> 00:11:29.798
man, syphilis,
Dr.

00:11:29.798 --> 00:11:34.215
Clark believed,
ran a different course than it

00:11:34.215 --> 00:11:40.201
would in the body of the white
man, and he had an idea of what

00:11:40.201 --> 00:11:43.928
he expected that difference to
be.

00:11:43.928 --> 00:11:49.745
In the body of white males,
the damage was overwhelmingly

00:11:49.745 --> 00:11:54.625
to their more highly
evolved--and therefore more

00:11:54.625 --> 00:11:58.259
vulnerable--neurologic systems.
 

00:11:58.259 --> 00:12:03.177
He expected that the result in
African-American males would be

00:12:03.177 --> 00:12:07.014
very different,
being less neurologically

00:12:07.014 --> 00:12:11.333
sophisticated,
their bodies would experience

00:12:11.333 --> 00:12:17.019
damage instead primarily to
their cardiovascular systems,

00:12:17.019 --> 00:12:21.914
and proof was to be gained by
studying the natural course of

00:12:21.914 --> 00:12:24.820
the disease in a group of
males--

00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:29.129
African-American males--who
were systematically untreated.

00:12:29.129 --> 00:12:34.282
So, let's keep this in mind:
it's to be in the bodies of

00:12:34.282 --> 00:12:38.684
African males that are
systematically not

00:12:38.684 --> 00:12:39.808
treated.
 

00:12:39.808 --> 00:12:45.710
Let's remember that this is a
study that was based not on any

00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:48.070
therapeutic objective.
 

00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:52.726
On the contrary,
the main interest of the

00:12:52.726 --> 00:12:58.547
syphilis study conducted at
Tuskegee was to examine

00:12:58.547 --> 00:13:03.668
syphilitic black male bodies
postmortem.

00:13:03.668 --> 00:13:07.928
For this reason,
as the biomedical ethicist,

00:13:07.928 --> 00:13:11.695
Susan Lederer,
explains, the real purpose of

00:13:11.695 --> 00:13:17.124
the study was not to treat the
African-American men involved as

00:13:17.124 --> 00:13:21.086
subjects,
or even as bodies,

00:13:21.086 --> 00:13:28.080
but rather as cadavers that had
not yet died.

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:33.422
Let me quote the words of one
of the physicians involved in

00:13:33.422 --> 00:13:37.029
the study,
who wrote the following:

00:13:37.029 --> 00:13:42.952
"The most important phase
of the study was to follow as

00:13:42.952 --> 00:13:48.875
many patients as possible to
postmortem examination in order

00:13:48.875 --> 00:13:54.597
to determine the prevalence and
severity of the syphilitic

00:13:54.597 --> 00:13:57.509
disease process."
 

00:13:57.509 --> 00:14:02.475
One physician of the
U.S. Public Health Service

00:14:02.475 --> 00:14:08.306
expressed the thought very
succinctly and with chilling

00:14:08.306 --> 00:14:09.710
candor.
 

00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:14.253
He said, "Once the study
was established,

00:14:14.253 --> 00:14:19.804
the subjects had no more
interest for us until they were

00:14:19.804 --> 00:14:21.320
dead."
 

00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:25.548
Well, what's the second
objective of the study?

00:14:25.548 --> 00:14:33.149
The second aim of the study is
often not remembered so clearly.

00:14:33.149 --> 00:14:37.570
It was more commercially driven
and less well known.

00:14:37.570 --> 00:14:43.668
Remember--cast your mind back
to the 1930s--

00:14:43.668 --> 00:14:49.351
and worldwide at that time,
there was a vast and stable

00:14:49.351 --> 00:14:54.928
demand for a reliable diagnostic
test for syphilis.

00:14:54.928 --> 00:14:57.759
The demand was created,
first of all,

00:14:57.759 --> 00:15:02.259
by law--laws that required,
for example,

00:15:02.259 --> 00:15:06.750
testing for syphilis before
marriage,

00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:12.710
testing for syphilis before
induction into the army.

00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:17.288
And still at this time,
at the start of the 1930s,

00:15:17.288 --> 00:15:22.427
there was no absolutely
reliable diagnostic test for the

00:15:22.427 --> 00:15:23.548
disease.
 

00:15:23.548 --> 00:15:27.523
Furthermore,
developing such a test was

00:15:27.523 --> 00:15:32.648
scientifically challenging
because of a feature of

00:15:32.648 --> 00:15:37.972
Treponema pallidum,
the spirochete that,

00:15:37.972 --> 00:15:42.452
as you know,
that's the pathogen responsible

00:15:42.452 --> 00:15:44.120
for syphilis.
 

00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:48.360
The Treponema pallidum,
as one of its features,

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:50.279
has extreme fragility.
 

00:15:50.279 --> 00:15:55.604
It could not really be
cultivated in the laboratory at

00:15:55.604 --> 00:15:56.808
this time.
 

00:15:56.808 --> 00:16:01.538
So, there was an alternative,
the experimenters thought,

00:16:01.538 --> 00:16:08.537
and that was a simple one:
to keep a ready supply of serum

00:16:08.537 --> 00:16:15.043
available through regular blood
samples from untreated

00:16:15.043 --> 00:16:17.990
syphilitic subjects.
 

00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:21.096
I started to say patients,
but the point is they aren't

00:16:21.096 --> 00:16:21.730
patients.
 

00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:26.298
They weren't to be treated,
they were subjects.

00:16:26.298 --> 00:16:31.230
And indeed, in the course of
the Tuskegee study itself,

00:16:31.230 --> 00:16:36.820
two new reliable tests were
developed using Tuskegee blood,

00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:41.009
and they were successfully
marketed.

00:16:41.009 --> 00:16:45.505
These two tests were the
venereal disease research

00:16:45.505 --> 00:16:49.759
laboratory test--
was one--and the other was

00:16:49.759 --> 00:16:55.357
called "the fluorescent
treponemal antibody absorption

00:16:55.357 --> 00:16:56.710
test."
 

00:16:56.710 --> 00:17:02.416
And needless to say,
the subjects of this experiment

00:17:02.416 --> 00:17:08.233
were never paid for this
particular service that they

00:17:08.233 --> 00:17:10.920
rendered to science.
 

00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:18.538
Well, a problem faced
Tagliaferro Clark and his

00:17:18.538 --> 00:17:21.190
experimenters.
 

00:17:21.190 --> 00:17:26.799
The problem was to recruit
volunteers, volunteers to take

00:17:26.799 --> 00:17:31.808
part in a study that had no
therapeutic purpose.

00:17:31.808 --> 00:17:35.318
Why would you volunteer,
you might ask,

00:17:35.318 --> 00:17:40.140
to take part in a study that
has no benefit for you,

00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:45.547
but whose purpose,
in fact, was to use your living

00:17:45.547 --> 00:17:49.630
body as a natural history
exhibit,

00:17:49.630 --> 00:17:56.318
to observe pathology while the
subjects received no treatment,

00:17:56.318 --> 00:18:02.358
and while their blood serum was
used as a culture medium?

00:18:02.358 --> 00:18:07.211
Well, they thought of a
solution, and that was to make

00:18:07.211 --> 00:18:12.980
use of the ample availability of
African-American males in Macon

00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:18.382
County who were vulnerable to
manipulation because they were

00:18:18.382 --> 00:18:23.261
desperately poor,
because they were illiterate,

00:18:23.261 --> 00:18:28.442
because they had almost no
access to medical care and the

00:18:28.442 --> 00:18:31.976
medical profession,
and because,

00:18:31.976 --> 00:18:37.719
at this very moment,
they had a substantial and as

00:18:37.719 --> 00:18:43.734
yet unfulfilled expectation--
the expectation created

00:18:43.734 --> 00:18:47.380
unknowingly by the Rosenwald
study--

00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:52.496
that there would soon be a
therapeutic intervention of the

00:18:52.496 --> 00:18:54.920
United States government.
 

00:18:54.920 --> 00:19:01.201
What the United States Public
Health Service did was to send

00:19:01.201 --> 00:19:07.058
out mass postings to black
churches in Macon County,

00:19:07.058 --> 00:19:11.955
and these letters and placards
let it be known that the

00:19:11.955 --> 00:19:17.848
government was embarking on the
long-awaited treatment program.

00:19:17.848 --> 00:19:21.656
Let me be clear again about
that: the announcement by the

00:19:21.656 --> 00:19:26.009
Public Health Service was that
the second phase was underway,

00:19:26.009 --> 00:19:31.160
and that what was coming was a
program of treatment--

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:34.430
treatment for anyone who
thought that he or she--

00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:37.731
well, in this case,
he--had what was called

00:19:37.731 --> 00:19:39.618
"bad blood."
 

00:19:39.618 --> 00:19:42.808
Now, "bad blood"
in Macon County,

00:19:42.808 --> 00:19:47.630
Alabama, was not a scientific
term,

00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:51.328
but a really elastic term,
local term,

00:19:51.328 --> 00:19:56.571
borrowed from popular culture
that had a number of

00:19:56.571 --> 00:19:59.140
inconsistent meanings.
 

00:19:59.140 --> 00:20:02.848
Bad blood might mean anemia.
 

00:20:02.848 --> 00:20:07.240
It might mean simple
indigestion.

00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:10.328
It might mean venereal disease.
 

00:20:10.328 --> 00:20:16.181
So, if you had bad blood,
whatever that was,

00:20:16.181 --> 00:20:19.720
treatment is on the way.
 

00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:23.028
And in addition to treatment,
volunteers,

00:20:23.028 --> 00:20:28.146
if you volunteered,
were promised that in due

00:20:28.146 --> 00:20:32.317
course,
they would be provided will all

00:20:32.317 --> 00:20:36.098
funeral expertise courtesy of
the U.S.

00:20:36.098 --> 00:20:40.981
government, provided they
allowed their bodies to be

00:20:40.981 --> 00:20:45.163
subjected to autopsy--
the famous postmortem

00:20:45.163 --> 00:20:50.730
examination that Tagliaferro
Clark was so enthusiastic about.

00:20:50.730 --> 00:20:55.896
They would also be provided
with free meals occasionally,

00:20:55.896 --> 00:21:00.048
and free transport to the
treatment center.

00:21:00.048 --> 00:21:05.720
So, what was on offer might not
seem enormously expansive,

00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:11.140
and I think it's a reflection
of the dramatic conditions,

00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:14.909
social conditions,
of people at the time that

00:21:14.909 --> 00:21:18.250
large numbers of people came
forward.

00:21:18.250 --> 00:21:22.719
And approximately 600 were
selected, and they were regarded

00:21:22.719 --> 00:21:26.650
by those who were rejected as
the fortunate ones.

00:21:26.650 --> 00:21:27.950
They were lucky.
 

00:21:27.950 --> 00:21:32.960
They'd been taken into a
treatment program of the U.S.

00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:34.190
government.
 

00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:40.064
And after selection,
the 600 were divided into two

00:21:40.064 --> 00:21:45.220
groups: 399 were found to have
syphilis,

00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:51.702
and they formed the study
group, 200 without syphilis

00:21:51.702 --> 00:21:54.318
served as controls.
 

00:21:54.318 --> 00:22:00.089
Now, this raises an ethical
issue immediately.

00:22:00.089 --> 00:22:02.930
Were these volunteers?
 

00:22:02.930 --> 00:22:08.477
I would argue that these 600
African-American males can only

00:22:08.477 --> 00:22:13.553
by some stretch of the
imagination be called volunteers

00:22:13.553 --> 00:22:18.630
for a really simple reason:
you can't be a volunteer if

00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:24.460
you're lied to about that for
which you're volunteering.

00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:28.459
In other words,
they volunteered for one thing,

00:22:28.459 --> 00:22:33.848
and what was put in place was
something radically different.

00:22:33.848 --> 00:22:38.835
They were promised treatment,
but treatment was precisely

00:22:38.835 --> 00:22:44.087
what they were to be denied
systematically for the remainder

00:22:44.087 --> 00:22:45.779
of their lives.
 

00:22:45.779 --> 00:22:50.990
Let me quote Tagliaferro Clark,
who presided over the first

00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:55.212
year of the study,
and directly approved the use

00:22:55.212 --> 00:22:57.190
of this deception.
 

00:22:57.190 --> 00:23:03.750
He wrote this to a colleague:
"These negroes are very,

00:23:03.750 --> 00:23:08.615
very ignorant,
and easily influenced by things

00:23:08.615 --> 00:23:13.372
that would be of minor
significance to a more

00:23:13.372 --> 00:23:16.400
intelligent group."
 

00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:20.710
Now, what was the site of the
study?

00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:27.388
This is a picture of one of the
buildings of Tuskegee Institute,

00:23:27.388 --> 00:23:31.099
now known as Tuskegee
University.

00:23:31.099 --> 00:23:33.980
It had a very honorable history.
 

00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:38.265
It was founded by Booker
T.***Washington for the

00:23:38.265 --> 00:23:42.460
education of freed men after the
civil war,

00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:47.372
and it was induced to cooperate
by the idea that such

00:23:47.372 --> 00:23:53.229
cooperation with the study would
enhance its prestige and would

00:23:53.229 --> 00:23:57.480
gain access for it to government
funding.

00:23:57.480 --> 00:24:01.288
And there was an
African-American nurse--

00:24:01.288 --> 00:24:09.088
we see here her with a
doctor--a Eunice Rivers,

00:24:09.088 --> 00:24:12.369
who was the local
African-American nurse who

00:24:12.369 --> 00:24:16.566
served as the intermediary
between the physicians of the

00:24:16.566 --> 00:24:21.220
Public Health Service and the
subjects of the experiment.

00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:26.701
A lot's been written about
Nurse Rivers and her role in the

00:24:26.701 --> 00:24:27.930
experiment.
 

00:24:27.930 --> 00:24:33.070
I think that we ought to
remember the context of the time

00:24:33.070 --> 00:24:38.672
and the training in which nurses
were trained not to question,

00:24:38.672 --> 00:24:41.608
but to do as they were told.
 

00:24:41.608 --> 00:24:46.203
Now, at the outset,
something also paradoxical

00:24:46.203 --> 00:24:49.891
happened,
and I would argue that it in

00:24:49.891 --> 00:24:55.516
fact, even if you wanted to have
an entirely cold-blooded look at

00:24:55.516 --> 00:24:59.118
scientific validity for such a
study,

00:24:59.118 --> 00:25:05.384
this particular study was made
scientifically invalid from the

00:25:05.384 --> 00:25:06.308
outset.
 

00:25:06.308 --> 00:25:10.219
At the beginning,
the experimenters ruined any

00:25:10.219 --> 00:25:15.518
possibility that the study could
ever produce valid scientific

00:25:15.518 --> 00:25:20.382
results because the government
doctors began the study by

00:25:20.382 --> 00:25:26.288
administering a small dose of
the accepted therapy of the day.

00:25:26.288 --> 00:25:30.153
In other words,
the experiment is to begin to

00:25:30.153 --> 00:25:33.490
have a study of untreated
syphilis,

00:25:33.490 --> 00:25:39.375
and they begin by administering
a small dose of the established

00:25:39.375 --> 00:25:42.890
therapeutic medication of the
day,

00:25:42.890 --> 00:25:49.557
which is a combination of
arsenic and mercury compounds

00:25:49.557 --> 00:25:51.410
plus bismuth.
 

00:25:51.410 --> 00:25:57.746
So, this ruined the premise of
observing purely untreated

00:25:57.746 --> 00:25:59.328
syphilitics.
 

00:25:59.328 --> 00:26:03.118
Then further weakening the
scientific--

00:26:03.118 --> 00:26:07.981
if we call it that--validity of
this study was the fact that

00:26:07.981 --> 00:26:12.268
some members of the control
group contracted venereal

00:26:12.268 --> 00:26:14.700
disease,
and they were simply

00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:16.808
transferred to the test group.
 

00:26:16.808 --> 00:26:22.656
They shuffled the deck between
the study group and a control

00:26:22.656 --> 00:26:23.450
group.
 

00:26:23.450 --> 00:26:28.773
Well, thereafter nonetheless,
this particular study continued

00:26:28.773 --> 00:26:32.557
for forty years,
down until 1972,

00:26:32.557 --> 00:26:40.558
and the volunteers thereafter
received no further treatment.

00:26:40.558 --> 00:26:45.741
They were subject to regular
annual physical examination and

00:26:45.741 --> 00:26:48.748
blood tests,
and to spinal taps,

00:26:48.748 --> 00:26:54.259
and they were given something
that they thought was medicine.

00:26:54.259 --> 00:26:58.304
It was called "pink
medicine,"

00:26:58.304 --> 00:27:03.904
and they took it regularly,
and actually what it was is

00:27:03.904 --> 00:27:05.150
aspirin.
 

00:27:05.150 --> 00:27:10.578
Let me give you a primary
source.

00:27:10.578 --> 00:27:14.740
This is the Macon County Health
Department, and this is the

00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:18.759
notice that was given to those
who were experimenting.

00:27:18.759 --> 00:27:22.440
It says, "Dear Sir,
some time ago,

00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:25.000
you were given a thorough
examination,

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:30.326
and since that time we hope
you've gotten a great deal of

00:27:30.326 --> 00:27:32.798
treatment for bad blood.
 

00:27:32.798 --> 00:27:36.778
You will now be given your last
chance to get a second

00:27:36.778 --> 00:27:37.828
examination.
 

00:27:37.828 --> 00:27:41.240
This examination is a very
special one,

00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:44.688
and after it is finished,
you will be given a special

00:27:44.688 --> 00:27:48.535
treatment (I underline that
word) if it is believed you are

00:27:48.535 --> 00:27:50.990
in a condition to stand
it."

00:27:50.990 --> 00:27:54.615
And let me just look at the
very bottom, in case you missed

00:27:54.615 --> 00:27:56.180
anything along the way.
 

00:27:56.180 --> 00:28:01.057
At the bottom you could read,
"Remember this is your

00:28:01.057 --> 00:28:04.630
last chance for special free
treatment.

00:28:04.630 --> 00:28:09.778
Be sure to meet the nurse."
 

00:28:09.778 --> 00:28:18.048
So, the deception in this study
was systematic and extended.

00:28:18.048 --> 00:28:22.979
In fact, there was a time when
there was a great threat to this

00:28:22.979 --> 00:28:26.538
Tuskegee study,
and that was when America

00:28:26.538 --> 00:28:31.955
entered the Second World War,
because at that time there was

00:28:31.955 --> 00:28:37.323
the danger that the members of
the study group risked being

00:28:37.323 --> 00:28:42.295
drafted into the Army,
and that would entail blood

00:28:42.295 --> 00:28:42.960
tests.
 

00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:47.673
Their syphilis would be
discovered, and the Army would

00:28:47.673 --> 00:28:51.500
provide treatment,
ending the experiment.

00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:55.803
So, the assistant surgeon
general of the United States

00:28:55.803 --> 00:29:00.594
intervened on behalf of the
study and provided the Selective

00:29:00.594 --> 00:29:05.384
Service Board of Macon County
with the list of all those men

00:29:05.384 --> 00:29:12.290
included in the study,
and they were exempted from the

00:29:12.290 --> 00:29:14.640
military draft.
 

00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:20.988
Now, at the outset of this
experiment, what was the therapy

00:29:20.988 --> 00:29:22.630
for syphilis?
 

00:29:22.630 --> 00:29:27.395
What is the treatment that
these men were being deprived

00:29:27.395 --> 00:29:27.828
of?
 

00:29:27.828 --> 00:29:31.960
And we have to say that by
contemporary standards,

00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:37.440
the treatment at the time was
not highly effective,

00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:42.977
and the most that we can say is
that the members of the study at

00:29:42.977 --> 00:29:48.074
the outset were being denied the
best available care of the

00:29:48.074 --> 00:29:50.358
standards of the time.
 

00:29:50.358 --> 00:29:54.873
This was the metal therapy,
as it was called,

00:29:54.873 --> 00:29:57.539
that I mentioned before.
 

00:29:57.539 --> 00:30:00.608
But what about later on?
 

00:30:00.608 --> 00:30:07.250
This study continues from '32
to '72.

00:30:07.250 --> 00:30:11.951
By later in the 1940s,
penicillin, a highly

00:30:11.951 --> 00:30:17.503
efficacious remedy for syphilis,
was developed,

00:30:17.503 --> 00:30:24.394
and it was determined that the
members of the study would be

00:30:24.394 --> 00:30:30.000
systematically denied the
antibiotic as well.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:35.509
Local doctors in Macon County
were all provided with the names

00:30:35.509 --> 00:30:41.301
of the members of the study,
and they were instructed by the

00:30:41.301 --> 00:30:46.708
Public Health Service that those
men were not to be given

00:30:46.708 --> 00:30:48.058
penicillin.
 

00:30:48.058 --> 00:30:54.911
So, the study continued for
twenty-five more years,

00:30:54.911 --> 00:30:59.568
when a therapy actually
existed.

00:30:59.568 --> 00:31:02.943
Well, by 1972,
at the conclusion,

00:31:02.943 --> 00:31:08.638
twenty-eight of the men in the
study died directly from

00:31:08.638 --> 00:31:10.009
syphilis.
 

00:31:10.009 --> 00:31:16.949
A hundred others died of
complications related to

00:31:16.949 --> 00:31:18.538
syphilis.
 

00:31:18.538 --> 00:31:24.907
Forty wives of members of the
study were infected with

00:31:24.907 --> 00:31:30.028
syphilis,
and nineteen children fathered

00:31:30.028 --> 00:31:37.390
by members of the study were
more with congenital syphilis.

00:31:37.390 --> 00:31:41.990
There was, however,
no intention in the Public

00:31:41.990 --> 00:31:47.614
Health Service to terminate the
study, and this was not,

00:31:47.614 --> 00:31:51.500
strictly speaking,
a secret study.

00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:54.720
There were published reports on
a regular basis.

00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:59.727
This is really one of the more
disconcerting parts of this

00:31:59.727 --> 00:32:00.430
study.
 

00:32:00.430 --> 00:32:08.450
What does it say about our
society at the time?

00:32:08.450 --> 00:32:12.318
The first report--in other
words, this is a study and a

00:32:12.318 --> 00:32:14.900
kind of study that was
published,

00:32:14.900 --> 00:32:18.440
that was written about publicly
in scholarly articles,

00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:23.769
and people thought this was
okay.

00:32:23.769 --> 00:32:30.942
The first published report was
in 1936, and papers were later

00:32:30.942 --> 00:32:37.160
written every four to six years
or so, until 1970.

00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:40.884
And strikingly,
there was never a protest

00:32:40.884 --> 00:32:46.192
within the medical community
about reports on this type of

00:32:46.192 --> 00:32:51.779
study that appeared in medical
journals for forty years.

00:32:51.779 --> 00:32:57.507
In 1969, a committee of the
Centers for Disease Control

00:32:57.507 --> 00:33:02.278
determined that the study should
continue,

00:33:02.278 --> 00:33:08.054
and this conclusion was backed
by local chapters of the

00:33:08.054 --> 00:33:11.368
American Medical Association.
 

00:33:11.368 --> 00:33:17.679
The end came only in 1972,
when a former employee of the

00:33:17.679 --> 00:33:22.383
Public Health Service,
named Peter Buxton,

00:33:22.383 --> 00:33:27.890
reported this story to the
Associated Press.

00:33:27.890 --> 00:33:32.990
An article appeared in the
Washington Star in July

00:33:32.990 --> 00:33:37.085
1972,
and this caused a national

00:33:37.085 --> 00:33:39.960
scandal,
with charges against the

00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:44.042
government of having carried out
the immoral equivalent of Nazi

00:33:44.042 --> 00:33:47.582
medicine,
of abuse of state power,

00:33:47.582 --> 00:33:51.269
of racism and many other
things.

00:33:51.269 --> 00:33:56.769
A famous book appeared by James
Jones called Bad Blood.

00:33:56.769 --> 00:34:00.348
Bad blood--you now know what
that means.

00:34:00.348 --> 00:34:03.865
There was a play,
Miss Rivers' Boys,

00:34:03.865 --> 00:34:05.538
by David Feldshuh.
 

00:34:05.538 --> 00:34:11.840
There was a movie,
Miss Evers' Boys,

00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:13.340
in 1997.
 

00:34:13.340 --> 00:34:18.353
The attorney Fred Gray
initiated a lawsuit on behalf of

00:34:18.353 --> 00:34:21.625
the patients,
and there was an out of court

00:34:21.625 --> 00:34:25.320
settlement that gave surviving
patients medical treatment--

00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:32.750
at last, at last--and 40,000
dollars in compensation.

00:34:32.750 --> 00:34:37.949
So, let's think about the
ethics of this experiment,

00:34:37.949 --> 00:34:42.255
what was learned,
and what ethical framework was

00:34:42.255 --> 00:34:47.204
established to prevent a
recurrence of something of the

00:34:47.204 --> 00:34:48.030
kind.
 

00:34:48.030 --> 00:34:52.358
We need to remember,
in judging the ethics of those

00:34:52.358 --> 00:34:55.909
who initiated and continued the
study,

00:34:55.909 --> 00:35:00.960
that at the time it started,
there were no clearly spelled

00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:06.099
out guidelines for biomedical
research on human beings,

00:35:06.099 --> 00:35:11.625
and it would be unfair and
anachronistic to hold

00:35:11.625 --> 00:35:18.561
researchers retrospectively
accountable for the standards of

00:35:18.561 --> 00:35:19.619
2010.
 

00:35:19.619 --> 00:35:25.298
But I think we need to look at
the concerns that were raised by

00:35:25.298 --> 00:35:30.704
medical ethicists in a variety
of forums with regard to this

00:35:30.704 --> 00:35:34.221
experiment--
remembering of course some of

00:35:34.221 --> 00:35:37.050
the considerations were
retrospective--

00:35:37.050 --> 00:35:41.891
but I'm going to argue that
many ethical bases made this

00:35:41.891 --> 00:35:45.590
unethical even by the standards
of 1932.

00:35:45.590 --> 00:35:50.021
Well, places where this was
raised: there was a

00:35:50.021 --> 00:35:55.512
congressional investigation led
by Senator Edward Kennedy,

00:35:55.512 --> 00:35:58.210
that took place in 1973.
 

00:35:58.210 --> 00:36:03.974
The National Medical
Association produced a report in

00:36:03.974 --> 00:36:05.750
the same year.
 

00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:11.170
There was a National Research
Act in 1974 that created what

00:36:11.170 --> 00:36:16.309
was called the National
Commission for the Protection of

00:36:16.309 --> 00:36:21.730
Human Subjects of Biomedical and
Behavioral Research,

00:36:21.730 --> 00:36:26.880
which came to be known
popularly as the Belmont Report.

00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:30.916
There was the class action suit
on behalf of the survivors and

00:36:30.916 --> 00:36:33.300
their relatives that I
mentioned,

00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:36.373
and in 1997,
there was an official

00:36:36.373 --> 00:36:41.030
presidential apology by
President Bill Clinton,

00:36:41.030 --> 00:36:44.650
of which more in just a minute.
 

00:36:44.650 --> 00:36:50.039
The standard that the medical
ethicists applied was Immanuel

00:36:50.039 --> 00:36:54.059
Kant's notion of a categorical
imperative.

00:36:54.059 --> 00:36:57.820
And that is that ethical
problems--

00:36:57.820 --> 00:37:04.340
and here I'm oversimplifying
Kant definitely--

00:37:04.340 --> 00:37:08.152
but the general idea,
which is what is important to

00:37:08.152 --> 00:37:10.387
us,
and the context of the

00:37:10.387 --> 00:37:13.300
conclusions of the Belmont
Report,

00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:21.088
was that ethical problems arise
whenever a human being is not

00:37:21.088 --> 00:37:26.929
used as an end for his or her
own benefit,

00:37:26.929 --> 00:37:33.713
but is used only as the means
to some further ulterior

00:37:33.713 --> 00:37:35.250
objective.
 

00:37:35.250 --> 00:37:42.288
And to give teeth and specific
content to that idea,

00:37:42.288 --> 00:37:47.945
a number of corollaries were
said to flow,

00:37:47.945 --> 00:37:51.809
to make that meaningful.
 

00:37:51.809 --> 00:37:57.110
The first was--and we live with
this, and you will know the

00:37:57.110 --> 00:38:01.039
phrase--the doctrine of informed
consent.

00:38:01.039 --> 00:38:05.119
Now, remember the letter to the
volunteers that I showed you,

00:38:05.119 --> 00:38:08.588
saying, "Remember,
this is your last chance for

00:38:08.588 --> 00:38:09.880
free treatment.
 

00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:11.989
Be sure to meet the nurse."
 

00:38:11.989 --> 00:38:15.739
That was hardly informed
consent.

00:38:15.739 --> 00:38:20.440
We know about the hoax of the
pink medicine;

00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:26.675
the ethically obtuse use of
that term "bad blood,"

00:38:26.675 --> 00:38:31.010
which wasn't a medically valid
concept;

00:38:31.010 --> 00:38:35.989
the fact that the volunteers
were never informed of the

00:38:35.989 --> 00:38:39.768
availability and utility of
penicillin;

00:38:39.768 --> 00:38:44.034
and you can't really have
informed consent if you don't

00:38:44.034 --> 00:38:46.639
know what you're consenting to.
 

00:38:46.639 --> 00:38:50.849
The subjects were never
specifically told that they had

00:38:50.849 --> 00:38:54.280
syphilis, about the course of
the disease.

00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:59.898
They were never consulted about
what possible treatment options

00:38:59.898 --> 00:39:01.440
were available.
 

00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:05.369
And spinal taps were presented
to them as what were called

00:39:05.369 --> 00:39:09.532
"spinal shots"--
once again, a slightly and

00:39:09.532 --> 00:39:14.601
deceptive play on words which
suggested that the spinal taps

00:39:14.601 --> 00:39:17.349
had some therapeutic purpose.
 

00:39:17.349 --> 00:39:22.056
Isn't that what you understand
when you go to the doctors and

00:39:22.056 --> 00:39:23.389
you get a shot?
 

00:39:23.389 --> 00:39:28.478
The second thing that was
thought to be an ethical

00:39:28.478 --> 00:39:34.711
response that's necessary in
biomedical research is the idea,

00:39:34.711 --> 00:39:38.139
the principle of beneficence.
 

00:39:38.139 --> 00:39:42.471
That is, the subjects of a
scientific and medical

00:39:42.471 --> 00:39:47.614
experiment should be entitled to
the expectation that some

00:39:47.614 --> 00:39:51.855
benefit will ensue for their
suffering and their

00:39:51.855 --> 00:39:53.659
participation.
 

00:39:53.659 --> 00:39:57.614
And the point about this study
in Tuskegee was that it was

00:39:57.614 --> 00:40:00.530
entirely designed to be
non-therapeutic.

00:40:00.530 --> 00:40:06.590
There would never be a benefit
to those who took part.

00:40:06.590 --> 00:40:10.579
A third major principle
outlined is that biomedical

00:40:10.579 --> 00:40:15.210
research should be governed by
what was called justice,

00:40:15.210 --> 00:40:18.902
and by that was meant the
principle that the most

00:40:18.902 --> 00:40:23.054
vulnerable members of a society
should not be chosen as

00:40:23.054 --> 00:40:27.440
experimental subjects to the
maximum extent possible.

00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:31.610
In other words,
biomedical research should

00:40:31.610 --> 00:40:36.800
refrain from doing its
experiments on prisoners,

00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:41.730
on the mentally deficient,
on children,

00:40:41.730 --> 00:40:45.889
the poor, and members of
disadvantaged minorities--

00:40:45.889 --> 00:40:51.289
people who can be easily
misled, coerced or intimidated--

00:40:51.289 --> 00:40:56.224
and the point about this
experiment was that the subjects

00:40:56.224 --> 00:41:00.806
at Tuskegee were targeted
precisely because they were

00:41:00.806 --> 00:41:03.010
maximally vulnerable.
 

00:41:03.010 --> 00:41:07.766
A fourth notion that should
govern biomedical research is

00:41:07.766 --> 00:41:10.909
that of a well-designed
experiment.

00:41:10.909 --> 00:41:13.858
Now, you ask:
how come that becomes an

00:41:13.858 --> 00:41:17.445
ethical category,
that an experiment should be

00:41:17.445 --> 00:41:21.318
well-designed;
the protocols should be so

00:41:21.318 --> 00:41:26.943
drafted that the anticipated
results have a reasonable chance

00:41:26.943 --> 00:41:31.070
of resulting from the procedures
adopted.

00:41:31.070 --> 00:41:33.985
In other words,
if you take part in a

00:41:33.985 --> 00:41:38.514
biomedical experiment,
there should be the expectation

00:41:38.514 --> 00:41:43.041
that the experiment is so
designed that any risk that you

00:41:43.041 --> 00:41:45.333
take,
such as it is,

00:41:45.333 --> 00:41:48.909
should not be entirely in vain.
 

00:41:48.909 --> 00:41:51.639
So, an ethical principle,
it was said,

00:41:51.639 --> 00:41:57.688
was violated when the Tuskegee
experiment began with a dose of

00:41:57.688 --> 00:42:00.806
therapy,
and then began by mixing the

00:42:00.806 --> 00:42:04.324
test and control groups,
so whatever suffering was

00:42:04.324 --> 00:42:08.445
undergone by the subjects of the
experiment would never have any

00:42:08.445 --> 00:42:09.949
scientific standing.
 

00:42:09.949 --> 00:42:14.547
In other words,
their suffering would be

00:42:14.547 --> 00:42:18.909
entirely without benefit to
anyone.

00:42:18.909 --> 00:42:23.586
A fifth thing is that an
ethical experiment should not

00:42:23.586 --> 00:42:28.617
violate the law and the existing
ethical guidelines of the

00:42:28.617 --> 00:42:30.934
government,
professional,

00:42:30.934 --> 00:42:33.090
and international authorities.
 

00:42:33.090 --> 00:42:42.822
Well, this study in Alabama
violated the law of 1927,

00:42:42.822 --> 00:42:50.309
which mandated treatment for
syphilis.

00:42:50.309 --> 00:42:59.440
There was also,
during the course of the

00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:05.576
experiment--
there was also the idea in

00:43:05.576 --> 00:43:11.728
1946--there was an American
Medical Association judiciary

00:43:11.728 --> 00:43:17.992
counsel that issued a report
establishing the principle of

00:43:17.992 --> 00:43:20.518
voluntary consent.
 

00:43:20.518 --> 00:43:23.170
In other words,
ethical standards emerged

00:43:23.170 --> 00:43:26.880
during the course of the
experiment that weren't there at

00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:30.556
the outset,
but the experiment continued to

00:43:30.556 --> 00:43:35.960
violate ethical standards that
were established after it began.

00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:40.572
And in 1964,
the World Health Organization

00:43:40.572 --> 00:43:47.322
issues a Helsinki Declaration
that said that informed consent

00:43:47.322 --> 00:43:53.059
should lie at the basis of
biomedical research.

00:43:53.059 --> 00:43:59.510
Two other things were mentioned
as ethically very important.

00:43:59.510 --> 00:44:04.565
One was that in future,
the assessment of the ethics of

00:44:04.565 --> 00:44:10.090
medical research should not be
by a closed medical caste.

00:44:10.090 --> 00:44:12.862
In other words,
doctors shouldn't establish

00:44:12.862 --> 00:44:16.030
themselves that what they're
doing is ethical.

00:44:16.030 --> 00:44:23.090
There should be independent
review boards to establish that.

00:44:23.090 --> 00:44:29.103
And then this experiment was
said to violate also the civil

00:44:29.103 --> 00:44:33.768
rights enshrined in the American
constitution:

00:44:33.768 --> 00:44:39.989
the Thirteenth Amendment
against involuntary servitude,

00:44:39.989 --> 00:44:45.130
and the Fourteenth Amendment
against trespass.

00:44:45.130 --> 00:44:50.914
Now, the question is:
what can we say about those who

00:44:50.914 --> 00:44:53.030
embarked in 1932?
 

00:44:53.030 --> 00:44:57.590
They didn't have the framework
of the Belmont Report,

00:44:57.590 --> 00:45:02.407
the Helsinki Declaration,
the judicial counsel report of

00:45:02.407 --> 00:45:05.559
the American Medical
Association,

00:45:05.559 --> 00:45:11.755
but I would argue that a
judgment on this isn't all

00:45:11.755 --> 00:45:13.739
retrospective.
 

00:45:13.739 --> 00:45:20.568
I'd remind you that already at
the start of the experiment in

00:45:20.568 --> 00:45:26.371
1932 it was unethical for
physicians to lie to their

00:45:26.371 --> 00:45:33.717
patients and research subjects,
and that it was unethical for a

00:45:33.717 --> 00:45:39.793
research program to violate the
law of Alabama of 1927 that

00:45:39.793 --> 00:45:45.659
mandated treatment for anyone
known to have syphilis.

00:45:45.659 --> 00:45:50.369
What's the legacy of the
Tuskegee experiment?

00:45:50.369 --> 00:45:53.989
Well, there are positives and
negatives.

00:45:53.989 --> 00:45:58.005
On the positive side,
this established a legally

00:45:58.005 --> 00:46:02.449
binding ethical framework for
biomedical research.

00:46:02.449 --> 00:46:07.353
The universe of conducting
biomedical research is now

00:46:07.353 --> 00:46:12.822
entirely different from that in
1932, and that's entirely a

00:46:12.822 --> 00:46:14.518
positive gain.
 

00:46:14.518 --> 00:46:19.427
This study then did produce
something really positive,

00:46:19.427 --> 00:46:22.389
which is an ethical framework.
 

00:46:22.389 --> 00:46:25.480
There's also the fact--and this
is positive too--

00:46:25.480 --> 00:46:29.590
there was a wide debate of all
of these issues through the

00:46:29.590 --> 00:46:31.231
press,
through plays,

00:46:31.231 --> 00:46:34.427
congressional debates,
scholarly literature,

00:46:34.427 --> 00:46:38.179
television broadcasts,
President Clinton's public

00:46:38.179 --> 00:46:41.239
apology and the coverage it
received,

00:46:41.239 --> 00:46:48.739
and all of you well know that
phrase about informed consent.

00:46:48.739 --> 00:46:53.420
On the negative side,
there were the sufferings of

00:46:53.420 --> 00:46:56.288
the study members,
their wives,

00:46:56.288 --> 00:47:00.969
their children born with
congenital syphilis.

00:47:00.969 --> 00:47:05.740
There was harm done to a great
university--Tuskegee

00:47:05.740 --> 00:47:08.889
University--and its reputation.
 

00:47:08.889 --> 00:47:13.195
There was harm in terms of a
breakdown in trust between

00:47:13.195 --> 00:47:17.898
African-Americans on the one
hand and the medical profession

00:47:17.898 --> 00:47:23.677
and the government on the other,
and one can see the legacy of

00:47:23.677 --> 00:47:28.750
this is the HIV/AIDS pandemic
that we're coming to.

00:47:28.750 --> 00:47:37.192
In 1990, when asked if HIV/AIDS
as an epidemic was a genocidal

00:47:37.192 --> 00:47:40.119
plot,
an opinion poll of

00:47:40.119 --> 00:47:46.190
African-Americans revealed that
ten percent responded yes,

00:47:46.190 --> 00:47:49.920
and twenty percent that they
were not sure.

00:47:49.920 --> 00:47:55.083
So, at that time in the 1990s,
thirty percent of

00:47:55.083 --> 00:48:01.233
African-Americans thought that
perhaps HIV/AIDS was not a

00:48:01.233 --> 00:48:04.860
disease but a genocidal plot.
 

00:48:04.860 --> 00:48:08.804
And this had
consequences--consequences in

00:48:08.804 --> 00:48:14.192
terms of the failure of people
to seek medical and public

00:48:14.192 --> 00:48:17.559
health education and treatment.
 

00:48:17.559 --> 00:48:21.858
If your level of distrust is
pitched that high,

00:48:21.858 --> 00:48:26.905
you can understand that,
and one of the reasons was the

00:48:26.905 --> 00:48:29.150
Tuskegee experiment.
 

00:48:29.150 --> 00:48:35.250
So, then I'd like to close by
remembering Clinton's apology in

00:48:35.250 --> 00:48:38.550
the White House on May 16,1997.
 

00:48:38.550 --> 00:48:42.840
There were at that time eight
experiment survivors,

00:48:42.840 --> 00:48:45.501
including this man,
Howard Shaw,

00:48:45.501 --> 00:48:49.018
plus representatives of three
others.

00:48:49.018 --> 00:48:54.449
And I can't compete with Bill
Clinton in eloquence,

00:48:54.449 --> 00:48:59.010
so I'd rather simply end by
quoting him.

00:48:59.010 --> 00:49:02.777
What he said was,
"The United States

00:49:02.777 --> 00:49:07.204
government did something that
was wrong, deeply,

00:49:07.204 --> 00:49:10.030
profoundly, morally wrong.
 

00:49:10.030 --> 00:49:14.853
It was an outrage to our
commitment to integrity and

00:49:14.853 --> 00:49:17.880
equality for all our citizens.
 

00:49:17.880 --> 00:49:21.164
To the survivors,
to the wives and family

00:49:21.164 --> 00:49:24.367
members, the children and
grandchildren,

00:49:24.367 --> 00:49:26.340
I say what you know.
 

00:49:26.340 --> 00:49:30.994
No power on earth can give you
back the lives lost,

00:49:30.994 --> 00:49:35.369
the pain suffered,
the years of internal torment

00:49:35.369 --> 00:49:36.860
and anguish.
 

00:49:36.860 --> 00:49:40.780
What was done cannot be undone.
 

00:49:40.780 --> 00:49:42.980
But we can end the silence.
 

00:49:42.980 --> 00:49:46.050
We can stop turning our heads
away.

00:49:46.050 --> 00:49:51.949
We can look you in the eye and
finally say, on behalf of the

00:49:51.949 --> 00:49:55.750
American people,
what the United States

00:49:55.750 --> 00:50:00.550
government did was shameful,
and I am sorry.

00:50:00.550 --> 00:50:06.750
The people who ran the study at
Tuskegee diminished the stature

00:50:06.750 --> 00:50:12.250
of man by abandoning the most
basic ethical precepts.

00:50:12.250 --> 00:50:16.829
They forgot their pledge to
heal and repair.

00:50:16.829 --> 00:50:22.510
They had the power to heal the
survivors and all the others,

00:50:22.510 --> 00:50:24.340
but they did not.
 

00:50:24.340 --> 00:50:29.389
Today, all we can do is
apologize.

00:50:29.389 --> 00:50:33.112
But you have the power,
for only you (that is,

00:50:33.112 --> 00:50:36.670
Mr. Shaw) and the others who
are here,

00:50:36.670 --> 00:50:39.860
the family members who are with
us in Tuskegee,

00:50:39.860 --> 00:50:44.260
only you have the power to
forgive.

00:50:44.260 --> 00:50:49.518
Your presence shows that you've
chosen a better path than our

00:50:49.518 --> 00:50:52.059
government did so long ago.
 

00:50:52.059 --> 00:50:56.860
You have not withheld the power
to forgive.

00:50:56.860 --> 00:51:01.538
I hope that today and tomorrow
that every American will

00:51:01.538 --> 00:51:05.349
remember this lesson and live by
it."

00:51:05.349 --> 00:51:11.000

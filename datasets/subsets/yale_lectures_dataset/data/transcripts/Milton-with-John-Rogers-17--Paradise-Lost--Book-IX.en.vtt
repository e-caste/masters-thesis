00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.519
Professor John Rogers:
 We've been looking for the

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:07.216
last few lectures at the ethics
and the theology that have

00:00:07.216 --> 00:00:10.150
throughout Paradise Lost
been produced -- at least,

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:13.152
this has been my argument --
been produced and sanctioned by

00:00:13.152 --> 00:00:15.922
Milton's narrator.
We learned, for example,

00:00:15.922 --> 00:00:19.939
both from the narrator and also
from Raphael that Eve is

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:22.967
inferior to Adam.
On the authority of the

00:00:22.967 --> 00:00:26.717
narrator and of Raphael,
the social hierarchy of Eden is

00:00:26.717 --> 00:00:30.807
established as what we can think
of as -- this is what also I

00:00:30.807 --> 00:00:35.170
have been arguing -- as the
dominant discourse of the poem.

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.992
We can think of this as the
poem's official doctrine,

00:00:37.992 --> 00:00:40.870
if a poem can be said to have
an official doctrine.

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.241
But there's obviously so much
more to Paradise Lost

00:00:44.241 --> 00:00:48.250
than the official discourses
of Raphael and the narrator.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.581
The poem seems continually --
and this is also what I've been

00:00:51.581 --> 00:00:54.635
arguing -- continually to be
opening up spaces for ideas

00:00:54.635 --> 00:00:58.811
other than the official,
sanctioned language of the

00:00:58.811 --> 00:01:01.739
narrator.
The angel Raphael,

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.897
you'll remember,
was eager to assert the

00:01:05.897 --> 00:01:12.613
hierarchical worldview when the
narrator was speaking about Adam

00:01:12.613 --> 00:01:15.688
and Eve,
but as we saw last time,

00:01:15.688 --> 00:01:19.979
Raphael was willing to loosen
the constraints of the notion of

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.200
hierarchy when he was pondering
the subject of astronomy.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.042
Raphael's astronomy was marked
really wonderfully by a lot of

00:01:29.042 --> 00:01:32.512
doubt and uncertainty,
and he refused to determine

00:01:32.512 --> 00:01:35.860
whether Ptolemy was right or
whether Copernicus was right.

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.296
There's a way in which the
poem's doubt about one kind of

00:01:39.296 --> 00:01:42.548
hierarchy seemed to bleed over
into the other forms of

00:01:42.548 --> 00:01:45.800
hierarchy with which the poem
was also concerned.

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.500
This is essentially a little
recap of the last

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.530
lecture.Now so far in
Paradise Lost,

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.560
 the tension between the
poem's official line and what we

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.759
can think of as its more
subversive strains -- this

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:04.150
tension has surfaced in
Paradise Lost in a kind

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.781
of contrapuntal fashion.
One position is simply

00:02:07.781 --> 00:02:12.370
juxtaposed without comment with
another, but the poem itself

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:17.038
never seems explicitly in any
way to acknowledge the presence

00:02:17.038 --> 00:02:21.550
of the conflict or the presence
of the contradiction;

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.154
that is, the poem doesn't seem
to acknowledge the presence of

00:02:25.154 --> 00:02:28.819
the conflict or contradiction
until now -- until Book Nine.

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:32.800
Book Nine, which is the book of
the Fall, is structured by,

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.849
I think, a far more explicit
opposition of that official,

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:38.878
dominant discourse,
on the one hand,

00:02:38.878 --> 00:02:42.240
and the much more open-ended
critique of that discourse,

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.624
on the other.
The stark opposition between

00:02:45.624 --> 00:02:50.030
these two competing positions is
manifest explicitly,

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:56.023
for me, in the argument between
Adam and Eve on the morning of

00:02:56.023 --> 00:03:00.445
the Fall before their
separation.Before we

00:03:00.445 --> 00:03:06.046
actually look at the content of
that absolutely remarkable

00:03:06.046 --> 00:03:09.616
argument,
it's worth musing on the fact

00:03:09.616 --> 00:03:13.159
that Adam and Eve are having an
argument at all.

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:15.412
It's amazing,
for that matter,

00:03:15.412 --> 00:03:18.129
that they're actually
conversing.

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:21.316
In the conversation between
Adam and Eve before Eve's

00:03:21.316 --> 00:03:23.987
departure to work alone,
we have what,

00:03:23.987 --> 00:03:28.132
I think, has to be the first
conversation on earth:

00:03:28.132 --> 00:03:32.178
the first genuine dialogue,
a conversation -- well,

00:03:32.178 --> 00:03:35.432
there may be a very brief
exception in Book Five,

00:03:35.432 --> 00:03:39.227
but we'll set that aside --
that involves two individuals

00:03:39.227 --> 00:03:43.091
who do not already have in mind
the content of the other's

00:03:43.091 --> 00:03:45.889
speech;
a conversation (and of course,

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:49.280
I'm thinking of all of the
conversations that we have,

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.604
or that you have,
with one another) that

00:03:51.604 --> 00:03:55.479
possesses at least some element
of epistemological uncertainty,

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:58.458
an element of surprise,
or the inability to know

00:03:58.458 --> 00:04:02.198
exactly what the other person is
going to say before he says

00:04:02.198 --> 00:04:05.557
it.Now Milton up to this
point hasn't been able to

00:04:05.557 --> 00:04:08.790
represent anything like the
genuine dialogue.

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.666
There are some exceptions.
Maybe the dialogue between

00:04:11.666 --> 00:04:15.172
Satan and Abdiel during the war
in heaven, but on earth it's not

00:04:15.172 --> 00:04:17.652
so clear.
Before this moment,

00:04:17.652 --> 00:04:22.709
all language is more or less
ceremonial or ritualistic

00:04:22.709 --> 00:04:25.336
utterance.
Let's think of the Father and

00:04:25.336 --> 00:04:27.680
the Son in the dialogue in
heaven in Book Three.

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.293
The Father's omniscience,
the fact that he knows

00:04:30.293 --> 00:04:33.129
everything, makes dialogue
absolutely impossible.

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:36.029
He always knows in advance what
the Son is going to say.

00:04:36.029 --> 00:04:41.114
Even with Adam and Eve before
Book Nine -- Adam and Eve seem

00:04:41.114 --> 00:04:43.785
to know in advance,
in some way,

00:04:43.785 --> 00:04:47.060
the content of the other's
speech;

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:50.375
and so Adam will begin a speech
(and this happens all the time)

00:04:50.375 --> 00:04:52.620
with some variation of this
little formula:

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.508
"Well thou knowest Eve that
blah blah blah" -- in other

00:04:55.508 --> 00:04:57.920
words,
of course you know this,

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.649
Eve, but I'm going to say it
anyway.

00:05:00.649 --> 00:05:03.100
Eve will tell Adam,
"That day I oft remember," and

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:06.000
then she will proceed to tell
him something presumably that

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.600
she's already told him a number
of times before.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.472
Conversation before this point
has been ritualistic,

00:05:12.472 --> 00:05:15.662
it's been ceremonial,
and it is essentially

00:05:15.662 --> 00:05:20.218
unnecessary in these early parts
of the poem.The dialogue

00:05:20.218 --> 00:05:24.395
between Adam and Eve at the
scene of their separation is

00:05:24.395 --> 00:05:28.800
really different from these
ceremonial utterances.

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.185
For the first time,
they're speaking speeches from

00:05:32.185 --> 00:05:36.537
alien perspectives with purposes
and intentions that are foreign

00:05:36.537 --> 00:05:40.621
to one another.
They seem to us familiar -- we

00:05:40.621 --> 00:05:45.240
recognize these people,
and in this conversation,

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:49.188
and it's actually an argument
as much as it is a conversation,

00:05:49.188 --> 00:05:52.596
Milton is giving us an emblem,
finally I think,

00:05:52.596 --> 00:05:56.103
of what this poem has been
doing all along:

00:05:56.103 --> 00:05:59.610
this poem has been arguing with
itself.

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:03.124
The dominant official language
of hierarchy has been pitting

00:06:03.124 --> 00:06:06.785
itself against the questioning,
subversive language of

00:06:06.785 --> 00:06:10.871
equality, and here in this
conversation Milton gives a

00:06:10.871 --> 00:06:15.420
dramatic shape to what has been
heretofore the abstract,

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:19.605
intellectual conflicts that had
so textured so many of the

00:06:19.605 --> 00:06:22.135
earlier books.
And so here in Book Nine at the

00:06:22.135 --> 00:06:24.189
moment of the separation between
Adam and Eve,

00:06:24.189 --> 00:06:29.813
we can see these two world
views, these two enormous ways

00:06:29.813 --> 00:06:33.730
in which Paradise Lost
thinks,

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:38.639
separate almost to the point of
absolute incompatibility.

00:06:38.639 --> 00:06:44.076
Whether this divergence will be
nearly a separation or whether

00:06:44.076 --> 00:06:48.251
it will be an actual divorce,
I think, is an open

00:06:48.251 --> 00:06:52.709
question.Now you can think
of Milton assigning faces here

00:06:52.709 --> 00:06:57.168
in Book Nine to a lot of these
positions that have heretofore

00:06:57.168 --> 00:07:00.302
been abstract.
Adam represents in this

00:07:00.302 --> 00:07:04.045
dialogue the nervous voice of
the poem's orthodoxy,

00:07:04.045 --> 00:07:07.339
and Eve represents the
questioning voice,

00:07:07.339 --> 00:07:11.430
the voice that questions and
critiques that orthodoxy.

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:15.204
To his credit -- and Milton's
not often given credit for this

00:07:15.204 --> 00:07:18.664
-- he goes out of his way to
lend a certain authority to

00:07:18.664 --> 00:07:21.840
Eve's critique,
and he does so by structuring

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:26.142
her argument as something like a
retrospective of his own career

00:07:26.142 --> 00:07:29.898
as a radical polemicist:
so Eve takes up the role of the

00:07:29.898 --> 00:07:33.379
radical Milton in this,
it seems.

00:07:33.379 --> 00:07:37.603
She's put in the strange and
utterly fascinating position of

00:07:37.603 --> 00:07:41.830
quoting the younger Milton,
and you have something like a

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:46.056
recap in the speeches of Eve
here, in this discussion with

00:07:46.056 --> 00:07:48.255
Adam,
of the great moments in this

00:07:48.255 --> 00:07:51.006
writer's work.Now,
the first subject of their

00:07:51.006 --> 00:07:54.044
discussion involves the topic
that has been absolutely

00:07:54.044 --> 00:07:55.940
central,
and we know this,

00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:59.661
to Milton throughout his
career, and this is the subject

00:07:59.661 --> 00:08:04.490
of work or labor -- essentially,
the value of human activity.

00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:08.579
The ostensible premise for the
separation of Adam and Eve on

00:08:08.579 --> 00:08:12.876
the morning of the Fall is Eve's
desire to work separately from

00:08:12.876 --> 00:08:15.420
Adam.
Eve is arguing that they will

00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:18.600
be more productive if they
divide their labors.

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:22.480
Think of the ways in which this
resonates for us.

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:25.635
Milton has been juxtaposing for
years the two accounts of the

00:08:25.635 --> 00:08:28.579
value of labor that he had found
in the New Testament,

00:08:28.579 --> 00:08:31.815
the parable of the workers in
the vineyard and the parable of

00:08:31.815 --> 00:08:34.451
the talents.
As early as Sonnet Seven,

00:08:34.451 --> 00:08:38.440
written when Milton was
twenty-three or twenty-four,

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:42.265
he was depicting scenarios in
which those two parables could

00:08:42.265 --> 00:08:45.832
be seen to argue with one
another on just this question:

00:08:45.832 --> 00:08:48.750
on the value and the importance
of labor.

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:51.225
While the parable of the
talents seemed to be chiding

00:08:51.225 --> 00:08:53.796
Milton for not working hard
enough and not working fast

00:08:53.796 --> 00:08:55.751
enough,
the parable of the workers in

00:08:55.751 --> 00:08:58.663
the vineyard seemed to
assure him in some way that he

00:08:58.663 --> 00:09:00.490
didn't need to work quite so
hard,

00:09:00.490 --> 00:09:06.879
that God didn't require his
incessant and laborious efforts.

00:09:06.879 --> 00:09:11.377
It's a measure of just how
difficult Milton wants it to be

00:09:11.377 --> 00:09:15.954
for us to adjudicate between
Adam and Eve in this book that

00:09:15.954 --> 00:09:19.899
he casts their argument in just
this language,

00:09:19.899 --> 00:09:23.230
the language of political
economy and work.

00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:27.065
It's an argument that involves
all of the implications,

00:09:27.065 --> 00:09:30.972
I think, of what are for Milton
those two highly charged

00:09:30.972 --> 00:09:35.305
parables.Now I think it's
almost impossible for us to come

00:09:35.305 --> 00:09:39.710
to this scene without some
assumption that Eve is wrong.

00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:43.258
We assume -- and it's
understandable -- that because

00:09:43.258 --> 00:09:46.111
Eve will, as we know,
go on to disobey the

00:09:46.111 --> 00:09:49.851
prohibition of the fruit,
she must therefore at this

00:09:49.851 --> 00:09:53.559
point on some level be wrong or
certainly, in some way,

00:09:53.559 --> 00:09:56.559
mistaken during this
conversation.

00:09:56.559 --> 00:10:00.455
But Milton takes some amazingly
interesting steps,

00:10:00.455 --> 00:10:04.748
I think, to counter what he
knows will be our immediate

00:10:04.748 --> 00:10:08.043
assumptions.
He attempts to counter our

00:10:08.043 --> 00:10:12.245
assumptions by allowing Eve to
voice that position in a

00:10:12.245 --> 00:10:16.448
dialogue that most closely
resembles the parable of the

00:10:16.448 --> 00:10:19.970
talents.
So look at page 383 in the

00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:24.220
Hughes. This is Book
Nine, line 201.

00:10:35.769 --> 00:10:38.345
First of all,
it's the narrator here who's

00:10:38.345 --> 00:10:41.389
opening the subject of work.
This is line 201.

00:10:41.389 --> 00:10:45.710
He's discussing the topic of
conversation between Adam and

00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:50.106
Eve at the beginning of their
day: "They cómmune how

00:10:50.106 --> 00:10:53.669
that day they best may ply /
Their growing work:

00:10:53.669 --> 00:10:57.762
for much thir work outgrew /
The hands' dispatch of two

00:10:57.762 --> 00:11:01.628
Gard'ning so wide."So we
learn from the official

00:11:01.628 --> 00:11:07.009
perspective of the narrator here
that Eve will have children.

00:11:07.009 --> 00:11:10.274
This is incredibly
consequential information that

00:11:10.274 --> 00:11:13.539
she was to have children even
before the Fall.

00:11:13.539 --> 00:11:16.346
We learn that even before they
have children,

00:11:16.346 --> 00:11:19.535
this garden demands an
extraordinary amount of work

00:11:19.535 --> 00:11:23.362
from Adam and Eve and that the
garden seems in some way to be

00:11:23.362 --> 00:11:25.850
actually spinning out of
control.

00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:32.705
This is a nightmare landscape
from the perspective of a house

00:11:32.705 --> 00:11:35.152
owner!
I think this passage is

00:11:35.152 --> 00:11:38.682
important because it's the
narrator here who validates

00:11:38.682 --> 00:11:42.812
Eve's initial position in this
first speech.So Eve suggests

00:11:42.812 --> 00:11:45.610
that when Adam and Eve work
together,

00:11:45.610 --> 00:11:49.285
their affectionate looks,
their absolutely adorable

00:11:49.285 --> 00:11:52.740
smiles, distract each other from
their labor.

00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:57.450
This is line 223 of Book Nine.
So all of those intervening

00:11:57.450 --> 00:12:01.049
looks and smiles,
she argues, "intermits / Our

00:12:01.049 --> 00:12:08.271
day's work brought to little,
though begun / Early,

00:12:08.271 --> 00:12:17.149
and th' hour of Supper comes
unearn'd."

00:12:17.149 --> 00:12:20.286
Eve has clearly embraced the
Protestant work ethic,

00:12:20.286 --> 00:12:23.988
and she displays an intuitive
grasp of the importance of the

00:12:23.988 --> 00:12:27.062
parable of the talents:
God only rewards those who

00:12:27.062 --> 00:12:31.139
exert themselves or who invest
their talent in an activity.

00:12:31.139 --> 00:12:34.777
It's impossible not to ascribe
to Eve at least some of the

00:12:34.777 --> 00:12:38.222
authority that's attached to the
parable of the talents

00:12:38.222 --> 00:12:42.179
here.Now Adam counters Eve
with some version of the parable

00:12:42.179 --> 00:12:46.270
of the workers in the vineyard,
claiming that there's more to

00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:49.279
work than simple productivity.
This is line 242.

00:12:49.279 --> 00:12:52.824
Adam's talking:
"For not to irksome toil,

00:12:52.824 --> 00:12:58.230
but to delight / He made us,
and delight to Reason join'd."

00:12:58.230 --> 00:13:02.306
For Adam, one is still serving
God when one takes pleasure in

00:13:02.306 --> 00:13:05.321
one's work.
The importance lies more in the

00:13:05.321 --> 00:13:09.653
willingness to serve and not in
the actual amount of work that's

00:13:09.653 --> 00:13:13.367
been accomplished or in the
amount of stuff that's been

00:13:13.367 --> 00:13:16.481
produced.
Milton himself was obviously

00:13:16.481 --> 00:13:20.399
always wanting to take Adam's
side in this debate,

00:13:20.399 --> 00:13:24.181
but he seems to have been
continually fearful -- at least

00:13:24.181 --> 00:13:27.084
this is my assumption -- that
Eve was right:

00:13:27.084 --> 00:13:31.000
that God requires our continual
labor.You can also hear

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.984
Milton making a distinction
between Eve's zeal for labor and

00:13:34.984 --> 00:13:38.360
his own efforts in writing this
very poem.

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:41.736
Milton's poem,
we remember,

00:13:41.736 --> 00:13:47.710
had been "long choosing but
beginning late."

00:13:47.710 --> 00:13:50.747
Like the workers in the
vineyard, Milton doesn't get

00:13:50.747 --> 00:13:54.500
around to writing the poem until
late in his literary career.

00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:58.596
Eve's labor is begun early,
and there's even a sense here

00:13:58.596 --> 00:14:02.179
that beginning early isn't good
enough for Eve;

00:14:02.179 --> 00:14:06.030
she seems to be pushing to get
up even earlier and to work even

00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:08.745
harder.
Eve is the modern voice of

00:14:08.745 --> 00:14:12.252
workplace efficiency.
She supplies the voice of

00:14:12.252 --> 00:14:16.491
conscience that chides not only
Adam but the voice of conscience

00:14:16.491 --> 00:14:20.662
that seems always to be chiding
the poet himself.Now surely

00:14:20.662 --> 00:14:24.699
Adam is right -- we have to hand
it to him -- in arguing that

00:14:24.699 --> 00:14:28.535
they are not in a position to
earn their supper as if they

00:14:28.535 --> 00:14:33.090
were merely wage laborers.
That's not how Milton's Eden

00:14:33.090 --> 00:14:35.474
works.
None of their labor actually

00:14:35.474 --> 00:14:38.879
goes into the harvesting or the
production of food.

00:14:38.879 --> 00:14:42.988
They're fed plenty,
but that's because the fruits

00:14:42.988 --> 00:14:47.183
simply land in their hands.
The work that they perform is

00:14:47.183 --> 00:14:50.255
all entirely ornamental -- it's
ornamental gardening:

00:14:50.255 --> 00:14:52.500
pruning, cutting back,
propping up.

00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:55.847
It's never productive in any
kind of economic sense or

00:14:55.847 --> 00:14:59.192
quasi-economic sense.
Their gardening is merely a

00:14:59.192 --> 00:15:02.765
virtuous activity that is
entirely divorced from the

00:15:02.765 --> 00:15:06.760
demands of productivity or the
demands of nourishment.

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:09.204
So Adam is right;
but while Adam is right,

00:15:09.204 --> 00:15:12.159
in a certain sense he doesn't
address directly the problem

00:15:12.159 --> 00:15:14.960
that the narrator himself has
already acknowledged,

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:17.919
and that's the problem that the
garden [laughs]

00:15:17.919 --> 00:15:21.909
seems to be growing at a faster
rate than Adam and Eve are able

00:15:21.909 --> 00:15:23.700
to manage.
This is amazing.

00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:29.173
Look at line 205.
This is where Eve notes how

00:15:29.173 --> 00:15:33.978
excessive [laughs]
the growth patterns seem to be

00:15:33.978 --> 00:15:37.139
in paradise.
So, Eve to Adam: 

00:15:37.139 --> 00:15:41.700
Adam, well may we labour
still to dress

00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:44.498
This Garden,
still to tend Plant,

00:15:44.498 --> 00:15:48.730
Herb, and Flow'r,
Our pleasant task enjoin'd;

00:15:48.730 --> 00:15:51.823
but, till more hands
Aid us, the work under our

00:15:51.823 --> 00:15:56.590
labor grows,
Luxurious by restraint;

00:15:56.590 --> 00:15:59.690
what we by day
Lop overgrown,

00:15:59.690 --> 00:16:02.509
or prune, or prop,
or bind

00:16:02.509 --> 00:16:06.370
One night or two with wanton
growth derides

00:16:06.370 --> 00:16:10.606
Tending to wild.
I think Eve here makes an

00:16:10.606 --> 00:16:14.047
absolutely central argument.
It's not an argument that Adam

00:16:14.047 --> 00:16:17.308
counters, and I think it's not
an argument that Adam would even

00:16:17.308 --> 00:16:20.095
be capable of countering:
and that's the idea that the

00:16:20.095 --> 00:16:22.830
garden is on some level growing
out of control,

00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:27.278
that the vegetation is
literally here "tending to

00:16:27.278 --> 00:16:29.950
wild."
It's "tending to wild" because

00:16:29.950 --> 00:16:33.745
Adam and Eve are continually
cutting it back -- that's their

00:16:33.745 --> 00:16:36.962
"pleasant task enjoin'd":
"the work under our labor

00:16:36.962 --> 00:16:39.222
grows,
/ Luxurious by

00:16:39.222 --> 00:16:43.589
restraintâ€¦"
So Eve isn't simply describing

00:16:43.589 --> 00:16:47.881
natural growth patterns in the
garden: she's examining the

00:16:47.881 --> 00:16:52.023
effects on nature of the
imposition of culture.We're

00:16:52.023 --> 00:16:55.487
reminded here of the
etymological origin of our

00:16:55.487 --> 00:16:59.229
notion of culture,
which involves the cultivation

00:16:59.229 --> 00:17:02.080
of the land -- it's an
agricultural metaphor.

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:06.404
In this respect,
Eve can be seen to articulate

00:17:06.404 --> 00:17:09.960
something like a theory of
culture,

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:12.786
and her theory has everything
to do with our understanding of

00:17:12.786 --> 00:17:14.670
the Fall not as a theological
problem,

00:17:14.670 --> 00:17:18.890
but our understanding of the
Fall as a cultural problem.

00:17:18.890 --> 00:17:21.826
According to Eve,
the garden is wilding,

00:17:21.826 --> 00:17:25.140
it's growing disobedient;
but it's not growing

00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:28.917
disobedient out of any natural
necessity but because of Adam

00:17:28.917 --> 00:17:31.990
and Eve's cultural imposition of
restraining.

00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:35.539
It's that pruning and propping
and lopping and binding.

00:17:35.539 --> 00:17:38.589
If left to itself,
for all we know -- who knows?

00:17:38.589 --> 00:17:42.607
I think this is a perfectly
reasonable scenario -- the

00:17:42.607 --> 00:17:46.548
garden might actually grow at a
reasonable, moderate,

00:17:46.548 --> 00:17:50.460
and orderly pace.
This new disorderliness in the

00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:54.404
garden, this wildness,
seems to be the result of the

00:17:54.404 --> 00:17:58.315
unnatural,
cultural attempt to restrain

00:17:58.315 --> 00:18:03.400
that natural order.So think
of what this is.

00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:07.194
God's command to Adam and Eve
to restrain the garden is on

00:18:07.194 --> 00:18:11.321
some level the miniature version
of his much more consequential

00:18:11.321 --> 00:18:15.115
commandment to refrain from
eating the fruit from the Tree

00:18:15.115 --> 00:18:18.500
of Knowledge.
I think that Eve in this speech

00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:22.399
presents us with a reading of
the significance of the more

00:18:22.399 --> 00:18:25.002
important commandment;
but of course,

00:18:25.002 --> 00:18:27.999
this is a reading that is
incredibly subversive,

00:18:27.999 --> 00:18:32.079
and that's why we rely so much
on Eve when we read this poem.

00:18:32.079 --> 00:18:36.269
She is so magnificently the
voice of the subversive.

00:18:36.269 --> 00:18:42.277
If I'm reading Eve correctly
here, the imposition of law

00:18:42.277 --> 00:18:47.630
doesn't control disorder:
it produces disorder.

00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:51.595
There's a sense in which the
arbitrary interdiction of the

00:18:51.595 --> 00:18:55.282
fruit sets in motion an
inexorable process whereby the

00:18:55.282 --> 00:18:58.899
interdiction has to be
broken.This is obviously a

00:18:58.899 --> 00:19:02.586
sense of the Fall that Milton
cannot permit within the

00:19:02.586 --> 00:19:06.412
official parameters of the
poem's dominant doctrine even

00:19:06.412 --> 00:19:09.910
though this theory,
Eve's subversive theory,

00:19:09.910 --> 00:19:13.795
does come actually rather close
to a number of Paul's statements

00:19:13.795 --> 00:19:17.433
in the Epistle to the Romans
-- but officially in the

00:19:17.433 --> 00:19:21.750
poem,
the Fall is an act of free will.

00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:25.467
It's a freely undertaken
choice, but according to Eve's

00:19:25.467 --> 00:19:29.760
embedded prophesy of the Fall,
which is what I take this to

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:33.269
be, there's no such thing really
as free will.

00:19:33.269 --> 00:19:37.262
The Father's prohibition seems
to necessitate in some way their

00:19:37.262 --> 00:19:40.932
disobedience in the same way
that pruning a tree -- and we

00:19:40.932 --> 00:19:44.088
know this to be a fact --
pruning a tree forces or

00:19:44.088 --> 00:19:47.563
necessitates new growth.
It's almost as if Eve were

00:19:47.563 --> 00:19:50.710
suggesting that there was
something like an organic,

00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:54.829
natural necessity to the
Fall.Now I think that's one

00:19:54.829 --> 00:19:59.322
way in which Milton looks back
at his former interest in work

00:19:59.322 --> 00:20:03.516
-- at his former interest in the
interaction of those two

00:20:03.516 --> 00:20:06.527
parables,
and he's bending their

00:20:06.527 --> 00:20:11.759
implications and their meanings
in an entirely new way here;

00:20:11.759 --> 00:20:15.063
but there's another way in
which the separation dialogue

00:20:15.063 --> 00:20:18.728
looks back at and essentially
uses the essential material from

00:20:18.728 --> 00:20:23.115
Milton's earlier career.
This is Eve's staggeringly

00:20:23.115 --> 00:20:28.110
brilliant deployment of the
central argument from

00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:32.585
Areopagitica,
the 1644 anti-licensing

00:20:32.585 --> 00:20:37.210
tract.
Look at line 320 of Book Nine.

00:20:37.210 --> 00:20:40.859
This is page 386 in the
Hughes. Now Adam has

00:20:40.859 --> 00:20:45.384
claimed that they can best pass
the trial of Satan's temptation

00:20:45.384 --> 00:20:49.690
if they're together -- a
perfectly reasonable position.

00:20:49.690 --> 00:20:53.381
If Adam is there to guide Eve
and to protect her,

00:20:53.381 --> 00:20:56.150
the Fall is less likely to
happen;

00:20:56.150 --> 00:21:00.228
but to Eve -- and this is Eve's
argument -- this sounds as if

00:21:00.228 --> 00:21:03.559
Adam were attempting to censor
her environment,

00:21:03.559 --> 00:21:07.484
as if he were trying to protect
her from the potentially

00:21:07.484 --> 00:21:12.113
dangerous speech of the tempter.
Of course, that is what he's

00:21:12.113 --> 00:21:15.575
trying to do,
and so she responds to what she

00:21:15.575 --> 00:21:18.880
hears to be Adam's paternal
solicitude.

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:25.595
This is Eve at line 322: 
If this be our condition,

00:21:25.595 --> 00:21:29.948
thus to dwell
In narrow circuit strait'n'd by

00:21:29.948 --> 00:21:33.890
a Foe,
Subtle or violent, we not endu'd

00:21:33.890 --> 00:21:36.960
Single with like defense,
wherever met;

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:41.560
How are we happy,
still in fear of harm?

00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:46.687
This is a devastating question.
Eve issues a powerful critique

00:21:46.687 --> 00:21:50.599
of what she takes to be Adam's
act of censorship.

00:21:50.599 --> 00:21:54.846
When she suggests that she is
living in an increasingly

00:21:54.846 --> 00:21:58.069
"narrow circuit straight'n'd by
a Foe,"

00:21:58.069 --> 00:22:02.160
it's almost as if she's
alluding to Milton's declaration

00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:06.354
in Areopagitica;
you remember these lines:

00:22:06.354 --> 00:22:10.838
"I cannot praise a fugitive in
cloistered virtue,

00:22:10.838 --> 00:22:16.054
unexercised and unbreathed,
that never sallies out and sees

00:22:16.054 --> 00:22:18.509
her adversary."
"What is virtue?"

00:22:18.509 --> 00:22:20.180
Milton had asked in
Areopagitica.

00:22:20.180 --> 00:22:22.079
What is it if it's never
tested?

00:22:22.079 --> 00:22:26.322
What is virtuous resistance if
there's nothing there actually

00:22:26.322 --> 00:22:29.858
to resist, if the information
one is being given is

00:22:29.858 --> 00:22:34.029
continually being licensed and
censored and controlled?

00:22:34.029 --> 00:22:39.521
Eve refuses to accept the idea
that Eden might be structured

00:22:39.521 --> 00:22:45.013
like an authoritarian state,
like the Stuart monarchy.At

00:22:45.013 --> 00:22:50.319
line 337 she lets loose.
This is a searing criticism of

00:22:50.319 --> 00:22:55.180
a paradise in which an
individual cannot be relied upon

00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:58.420
to choose freely her own
actions,

00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:03.472
line 337: "Let us not then
suspect our happy State / Left

00:23:03.472 --> 00:23:09.695
so imperfect by the Maker wise,
/ As not secure to single or

00:23:09.695 --> 00:23:12.028
combin'd."
Now the syntax is a little

00:23:12.028 --> 00:23:13.476
difficult there.
She's saying,

00:23:13.476 --> 00:23:15.980
"Let's not imagine that we're
unsafe here.

00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:20.859
Let's not doubt that the maker
created us secure," by which she

00:23:20.859 --> 00:23:25.188
means "safe," "whether we're on
our own or whether we're

00:23:25.188 --> 00:23:28.818
together."
Then she continues:

00:23:28.818 --> 00:23:33.874
"Frail is our happiness,
if this be so,

00:23:33.874 --> 00:23:39.329
/ And Eden were no Eden thus
expos'd."

00:23:39.329 --> 00:23:44.561
Eve here is exposing an
ideological contradiction at the

00:23:44.561 --> 00:23:49.636
heart of Milton's Eden.
At the center of her argument

00:23:49.636 --> 00:23:55.680
is a powerful alternative to the
official line of Milton's poem.

00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:59.909
Eve is pronouncing -- this is
the structure of a theological

00:23:59.909 --> 00:24:03.995
argument, this is a theodicy:
she's justifying the ways of

00:24:03.995 --> 00:24:07.345
God to men as she sees them.
This is the logic,

00:24:07.345 --> 00:24:10.569
I take it, of what she's just
said: "If I am not free to

00:24:10.569 --> 00:24:13.735
resist temptation alone,
then this is not a justifiable

00:24:13.735 --> 00:24:16.157
world.
If I am not free to resist

00:24:16.157 --> 00:24:19.440
temptation alone,
God is not a justifiable God.

00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:25.446
Eden were no Eden, thus exposed.
Therefore," she concludes,

00:24:25.446 --> 00:24:28.970
"I must be free to resist
temptation alone."

00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:32.324
That's her logical
conclusion.Now Eve's claim

00:24:32.324 --> 00:24:36.448
for the true state of Eden is a
lot like Milton's claim some

00:24:36.448 --> 00:24:40.292
twenty years earlier in
Areopagitica for the true

00:24:40.292 --> 00:24:44.612
state of England.
There is at base a state of

00:24:44.612 --> 00:24:49.735
equality among human
individuals, and the individual

00:24:49.735 --> 00:24:52.703
himself,
singly and not combined,

00:24:52.703 --> 00:24:56.430
should be empowered to resist
temptation alone.

00:24:56.430 --> 00:25:00.827
The poem has gone to great
lengths to make the official

00:25:00.827 --> 00:25:03.839
case for God's -- how could it
not?

00:25:03.839 --> 00:25:10.541
this is a version of Genesis --
for God's imposition of an

00:25:10.541 --> 00:25:17.007
arbitrary set of hierarchical
distinctions and for God's

00:25:17.007 --> 00:25:23.805
ability to impose arbitrary law.
Milton is supporting that

00:25:23.805 --> 00:25:28.306
throughout the poem;
but Paradise Lost is

00:25:28.306 --> 00:25:33.433
also willing to identify just
those arbitrary hierarchies as

00:25:33.433 --> 00:25:38.039
something like the source for
Eden's imperfection,

00:25:38.039 --> 00:25:42.260
and he does that even as he
celebrates God's ability to

00:25:42.260 --> 00:25:45.230
impose these arbitrary
distinctions.

00:25:45.230 --> 00:25:49.262
It's this exposure of Eden's
structural flaws,

00:25:49.262 --> 00:25:54.550
I think, that best helps us
understand the internal dynamics

00:25:54.550 --> 00:25:58.755
of the temptation scene.
When Satan tempts Eve,

00:25:58.755 --> 00:26:03.146
he invariably tempts her with
some version of all of those

00:26:03.146 --> 00:26:06.768
desires and all of those
aspirations that Eden's

00:26:06.768 --> 00:26:09.849
hierarchical culture has
struggled,

00:26:09.849 --> 00:26:16.306
and struggled mightily,
to suppress.Look at the top

00:26:16.306 --> 00:26:22.319
of page 391.
This is line 538 of Book Nine.

00:26:22.319 --> 00:26:25.679
Our first encounter with Eve
involved, you'll remember,

00:26:25.679 --> 00:26:28.789
the suppression of her
admiration of that beautiful

00:26:28.789 --> 00:26:32.459
image that she saw in the pool
-- or the suppression of what

00:26:32.459 --> 00:26:36.690
came later to be interpreted as
something like her narcissism.

00:26:36.690 --> 00:26:39.436
Eve was created with what
seemed to be a natural,

00:26:39.436 --> 00:26:42.582
beautiful, and instinctive
admiration for the image that

00:26:42.582 --> 00:26:45.168
she found in the pool.
That admiration was,

00:26:45.168 --> 00:26:48.078
of course, entirely innocent
because Eve had no way of

00:26:48.078 --> 00:26:50.220
knowing that that was her own
image;

00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:53.438
but with the onset of that
mysterious warning voice,

00:26:53.438 --> 00:26:56.529
Eve was turned away from that
image of herself,

00:26:56.529 --> 00:27:02.069
and her behavior became branded
as narcissism thereafter.

00:27:02.069 --> 00:27:04.924
It wasn't, of course,
true narcissism,

00:27:04.924 --> 00:27:09.707
but the imposition of that new
restraint upon her seems to have

00:27:09.707 --> 00:27:12.323
produced in Eve,
or created in her,

00:27:12.323 --> 00:27:14.349
something like a true
narcissism.

00:27:14.349 --> 00:27:17.851
It's this culturally produced
-- this is a character flaw that

00:27:17.851 --> 00:27:20.549
we can identify as a culturally
produced one,

00:27:20.549 --> 00:27:24.446
and it's one that Satan is able
to exploit with utter ingenuity

00:27:24.446 --> 00:27:29.774
at the temptation scene.
So this is Satan at line 538 to

00:27:29.774 --> 00:27:32.812
Eve:
Fairest resemblance of

00:27:32.812 --> 00:27:36.878
thy Maker fair,Thee all
living things gaze on,

00:27:36.878 --> 00:27:41.480
all things thineBy gift,
and thy Celestial Beauty

00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:46.386
adoreWith ravishment beheld,
there best beheldWhere

00:27:46.386 --> 00:27:50.800
universally admir'd.
So Eve's affection for a

00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:54.231
responsive image,
for a sympathetic gaze --

00:27:54.231 --> 00:27:59.296
that's all she was getting out
of the pool -- was denied her at

00:27:59.296 --> 00:28:02.938
the pool.
This restraint seems to have

00:28:02.938 --> 00:28:08.560
produced in her something like a
self-love, a self-love that has

00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:13.380
grown luxurious by restraint,
and Satan knows that.

00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:17.361
The tendency to narcissism was
only one component of her

00:28:17.361 --> 00:28:21.559
character that was exposed in
the scene at the poolside.

00:28:21.559 --> 00:28:23.960
The pleasure that Eve was
deriving from the answering

00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:27.581
smiles, those beautiful,
sympathetic looks in the pool

00:28:27.581 --> 00:28:32.840
-- that pleasure is akin in many
ways to the pleasure that a lot

00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:38.099
of infants derive from the first
moments of their existence.

00:28:38.099 --> 00:28:43.294
I'm thinking of the infant's
pleasure in its initial

00:28:43.294 --> 00:28:48.599
interaction with the mother.
This shouldn't be surprising:

00:28:48.599 --> 00:28:52.866
one of the things that Milton
tries to accomplish in the

00:28:52.866 --> 00:28:57.210
narrative of Eve's development
is something like a larger

00:28:57.210 --> 00:29:02.019
theory of human development in
general.But of course,

00:29:02.019 --> 00:29:05.599
unlike all the rest of us,
Eve doesn't have a mother.

00:29:05.599 --> 00:29:11.045
It's the role of the mother
both in culture and in nature

00:29:11.045 --> 00:29:14.740
that has been systemically
excluded,

00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:18.126
necessarily but nonetheless
systematically excluded,

00:29:18.126 --> 00:29:21.582
from Paradise Lost.
Whatever experience of a

00:29:21.582 --> 00:29:25.242
kind of maternal affection that
Eve may have felt in the

00:29:25.242 --> 00:29:28.834
answering looks and the
sympathetic smiles is summarily

00:29:28.834 --> 00:29:33.218
cut off with the warning voice.
Just as he did with her

00:29:33.218 --> 00:29:37.973
narcissism, Satan tempts Eve
with precisely that natural

00:29:37.973 --> 00:29:43.160
phenomenon, that natural
instinct that's been denied her.

00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:48.175
Look at Satan, line 578.
He describes his first glance

00:29:48.175 --> 00:29:51.667
at the "goodly Tree far distant
to behold," and we,

00:29:51.667 --> 00:29:54.740
of course, know what that
goodly tree is.

00:29:54.740 --> 00:29:57.563
The serpent says: 
I nearer drew to

00:29:57.563 --> 00:30:02.534
gaze;When from the boughs a
savory odor blown,Grateful

00:30:02.534 --> 00:30:05.549
to appetite, more pleas'd my
sense

00:30:05.549 --> 00:30:10.866
Than smell of sweetest Fennel,
or the TeatsOf Ewe or Goat

00:30:10.866 --> 00:30:15.561
dropping with Milk at
Ev'n,Unsuckt of Lamb or Kid,

00:30:15.561 --> 00:30:20.586
that tend thir play.
Surely we all agree that this

00:30:20.586 --> 00:30:24.829
is a surprising [laughs]
and a strange simile here.

00:30:24.829 --> 00:30:29.623
In comparing the smell of the
forbidden fruit to mother's

00:30:29.623 --> 00:30:34.930
milk, Satan is offering Eve an
embedded image of the mother,

00:30:34.930 --> 00:30:40.107
and by placing the scene in the
evening or what he calls "Ev'n,"

00:30:40.107 --> 00:30:45.038
Satan is able to insert Eve's
actual name into the expression

00:30:45.038 --> 00:30:49.887
of a natural desire to suckle at
the mother's breast.But

00:30:49.887 --> 00:30:54.325
what's at stake here isn't
simply Eve's longing for the

00:30:54.325 --> 00:30:58.844
mother that she never had.
The situation is a lot more

00:30:58.844 --> 00:31:02.037
radical than that because at the
scene at the pool,

00:31:02.037 --> 00:31:04.719
in so many ways,
Eve was actually mothering

00:31:04.719 --> 00:31:07.382
herself.
At least on an experiential

00:31:07.382 --> 00:31:11.590
level, Eve seemed to have been
-- this is the way she must have

00:31:11.590 --> 00:31:14.983
felt it subjectively:
she was the source of her own

00:31:14.983 --> 00:31:18.988
creation much as Satan claimed
that he had raised himself by

00:31:18.988 --> 00:31:22.669
his own quickening power.
Eve had represented the

00:31:22.669 --> 00:31:26.147
possibility for the poem of
something like an absolute

00:31:26.147 --> 00:31:29.559
self-possession and an absolute
self-containment.

00:31:29.559 --> 00:31:32.865
You'll remember that Adam had
informed Raphael in Book Eight

00:31:32.865 --> 00:31:36.170
(this was at line 547 of Book
Eight) that he had been struck

00:31:36.170 --> 00:31:39.139
by this incredible air of
self-contained-ness that Eve

00:31:39.139 --> 00:31:41.306
had.
He tells Raphael,

00:31:41.306 --> 00:31:46.127
"[W]hen I approach / Her
loveliness, so absolute she

00:31:46.127 --> 00:31:49.529
seems / And in herself
complete,"

00:31:49.529 --> 00:31:51.922
and Raphael,
of course, hastened to warn

00:31:51.922 --> 00:31:55.420
Adam against the attraction to
female self-sufficiency.

00:31:55.420 --> 00:31:59.500
There's a sense in which
Eve is absolutely independent.

00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:05.058
She's mother and daughter
united in one self-determining

00:32:05.058 --> 00:32:10.718
being, and it is just this
maternal self-sufficiency that

00:32:10.718 --> 00:32:17.086
the law of the garden has denied
Eve -- and so like clockwork it

00:32:17.086 --> 00:32:21.230
returns here in Satan's
temptation.

00:32:21.230 --> 00:32:24.739
The third element of Satan's
temptation involves the taboo

00:32:24.739 --> 00:32:28.064
that was established by Raphael
-- this is the taboo of

00:32:28.064 --> 00:32:30.247
speculation.
Raphael had told Adam,

00:32:30.247 --> 00:32:33.076
"Don't concern yourself and
don't worry so much about

00:32:33.076 --> 00:32:36.123
speculating about the cosmos
because the structure of the

00:32:36.123 --> 00:32:38.299
cosmos simply doesn't concern
you."

00:32:38.299 --> 00:32:42.560
"Be lowly wise," Raphael told
Adam, and "know to know no

00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:44.932
more."
How on earth could Milton,

00:32:44.932 --> 00:32:48.707
the author of Areopagitica,
put those words in the

00:32:48.707 --> 00:32:51.778
mouth of the archangel?
It's too troubling even to

00:32:51.778 --> 00:32:56.222
speculate about.
But look down at line 602 of

00:32:56.222 --> 00:32:59.182
Book Nine.
(This is page 392.) The serpent

00:32:59.182 --> 00:33:02.188
argues that one of the effects
of the fruit was the awakening

00:33:02.188 --> 00:33:05.968
(and of course,
he's lying) in him of the power

00:33:05.968 --> 00:33:11.259
of reason, wakening in him his
capacity for speculation.

00:33:11.259 --> 00:33:14.781
Thenceforth to
Speculations high or deepI

00:33:14.781 --> 00:33:17.387
turn'd my thoughts,
and with capacious

00:33:17.387 --> 00:33:21.049
mindConsider'd all things
visible in Heav'n,

00:33:21.049 --> 00:33:24.875
Or Earth,
or Middle, all things fair and

00:33:24.875 --> 00:33:28.136
good...
No form of speculation has been

00:33:28.136 --> 00:33:31.740
licensed or censored for the
serpent, according to Satan.

00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:34.599
He gets to think whatever he
wants.

00:33:34.599 --> 00:33:38.135
This is exactly the vision of
the liberal, Miltonic universe

00:33:38.135 --> 00:33:41.071
represented so majestically and
so compellingly in

00:33:41.071 --> 00:33:44.833
Areopagitica.
Again the temptation to

00:33:44.833 --> 00:33:50.896
speculate is intimately linked
with this cultural law against

00:33:50.896 --> 00:33:57.362
speculation and the restraint of
speculation.Finally and most

00:33:57.362 --> 00:34:01.787
importantly,
Eve is tempted with just that

00:34:01.787 --> 00:34:07.483
aspect of her status that this
poem has most vigorously denied

00:34:07.483 --> 00:34:12.431
her and that's the possibility
-- and I take this very

00:34:12.431 --> 00:34:15.980
seriously -- that she's
actually,

00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:20.250
at least on a natural and
ontological level,

00:34:20.250 --> 00:34:24.128
Adam's equal.
The possibility of the

00:34:24.128 --> 00:34:29.014
fundamental or natural
egalitarianism of Eden,

00:34:29.014 --> 00:34:32.184
rather,
is one of the principal objects

00:34:32.184 --> 00:34:35.882
of cultural suppression in
Raphael's long discourse with

00:34:35.882 --> 00:34:38.679
Adam.
Raphael's denial of their

00:34:38.679 --> 00:34:42.747
equality really fills the pages
of Book Eight,

00:34:42.747 --> 00:34:48.081
and so naturally the desire for
equality surfaces one of the

00:34:48.081 --> 00:34:52.329
principal motives for Eve's
transgression.

00:34:52.329 --> 00:34:56.490
By eating the fruit,
Eve perhaps -- this is

00:34:56.490 --> 00:35:02.633
unspeakably heartbreaking -- can
produce in herself an equality

00:35:02.633 --> 00:35:05.358
with Adam.
That's the fantasy,

00:35:05.358 --> 00:35:08.879
and the speaking serpent
provides the best evidence

00:35:08.879 --> 00:35:12.894
imaginable of the alleged
ability of the fruit to function

00:35:12.894 --> 00:35:18.048
as a kind of chemical equalizer.
It's like a testosterone-laced

00:35:18.048 --> 00:35:22.210
cocktail that offers the false
hope of equality.

00:35:22.210 --> 00:35:27.971
Look at line 687, Satan to Eve: 
[L]ook on mee,Mee who

00:35:27.971 --> 00:35:31.470
have touch'd and tasted,
yet both live,And life more

00:35:31.470 --> 00:35:34.460
perfet have attain'd than
FateMeant mee,

00:35:34.460 --> 00:35:38.119
by vent'ring higher then my
Lot.

00:35:38.119 --> 00:35:40.246
In other words,
"Eat this fruit and you will

00:35:40.246 --> 00:35:42.522
become greater than you have,
up to this point,

00:35:42.522 --> 00:35:45.717
been allowed to be.
Eat this fruit and you will

00:35:45.717 --> 00:35:49.300
become greater than your lot in
life permits."

00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:55.039
Now this has to be one of the
most powerful inducements.

00:35:55.039 --> 00:36:00.934
As a political philosopher,
Milton knows better than anyone

00:36:00.934 --> 00:36:06.422
the power of the desire for
equality.It's just this

00:36:06.422 --> 00:36:12.724
promise of equality that is most
important to Eve after she has

00:36:12.724 --> 00:36:16.170
eaten the fruit.
This is after the Fall.

00:36:16.170 --> 00:36:22.720
This is line 816 of Book Nine.
This is the middle of page 397.

00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:28.412
Eve is musing to herself: 
But to Adam in what

00:36:28.412 --> 00:36:33.061
sortShall I appear?
shall I to him make knownAs

00:36:33.061 --> 00:36:36.155
yet my change,
and give him to partakeFull

00:36:36.155 --> 00:36:38.699
happiness with mee,
or rather not.

00:36:38.699 --> 00:36:41.852
But keep the odds of Knowledge
in my powerWithout

00:36:41.852 --> 00:36:44.948
Copartner?
so to add what wantsIn

00:36:44.948 --> 00:36:50.139
Female Sex, the more to draw his
Love [and I love this],

00:36:50.139 --> 00:36:56.196
And render me more equal,
and perhaps,A thing not

00:36:56.196 --> 00:36:59.874
undesireable,
sometimeSuperior:

00:36:59.874 --> 00:37:05.534
for inferior who is free?
There is an unspeakable pathos

00:37:05.534 --> 00:37:09.283
charging these lines because it
becomes clear that one of the

00:37:09.283 --> 00:37:12.594
primary reasons that Eve has
fallen in the first place

00:37:12.594 --> 00:37:15.906
involves a structural problem
inherent in the Miltonic

00:37:15.906 --> 00:37:19.342
paradise: and that's the
official insistence on a social

00:37:19.342 --> 00:37:22.087
hierarchy.
Of course, the poem is

00:37:22.087 --> 00:37:26.262
continually arguing that social
inferiority does not impinge

00:37:26.262 --> 00:37:30.339
upon human freedom.
Just because Eve is inferior to

00:37:30.339 --> 00:37:33.510
Adam doesn't mean that she isn't
free.

00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:37.187
That's the official line,
but Milton knows perfectly well

00:37:37.187 --> 00:37:41.260
that the radical type of freedom
for which he had argued in his

00:37:41.260 --> 00:37:45.397
early career as a polemicist had
been founded upon an assumption

00:37:45.397 --> 00:37:48.345
of equality.
In Areopagitica Milton

00:37:48.345 --> 00:37:52.182
had implied that we're all free
to read whatever we want because

00:37:52.182 --> 00:37:54.739
we are all equally endowed with
reason.

00:37:54.739 --> 00:37:59.029
That's at least implicitly his
argument, yet Paradise Lost

00:37:59.029 --> 00:38:03.532
had instituted at the heart
of its body politic a distinctly

00:38:03.532 --> 00:38:08.337
hierarchical society.
There may be a natural instinct

00:38:08.337 --> 00:38:11.433
for equality.
There's a natural instinct for

00:38:11.433 --> 00:38:14.380
equality that we feel both with
Adam and with Eve,

00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:18.245
but the official culture of
Eden has labored to suppress

00:38:18.245 --> 00:38:21.337
that instinct;
and at the moment of the

00:38:21.337 --> 00:38:25.680
temptation, the tremendous cost
of that suppression is

00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:29.015
measured.Now,
from the doctrinal point of

00:38:29.015 --> 00:38:32.469
view, Eve is clearly wrong here
to question her divinely

00:38:32.469 --> 00:38:35.170
sanctioned place in the order of
things.

00:38:35.170 --> 00:38:38.551
We have to see her as wrong,
but there is a voice that

00:38:38.551 --> 00:38:42.492
counters the poem's doctrine,
and it argues that the

00:38:42.492 --> 00:38:47.487
imposition of such an arbitrary
law of hierarchy can only

00:38:47.487 --> 00:38:52.840
produce a corresponding desire
to subvert that hierarchy.

00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:56.791
You'll note here the further
point that the denial of

00:38:56.791 --> 00:39:00.362
equality doesn't merely
precipitate a desire for

00:39:00.362 --> 00:39:03.588
equality.
I think it pushes us even

00:39:03.588 --> 00:39:07.260
further to a desire -- it's
really wild.

00:39:07.260 --> 00:39:12.528
The denial of equality actually
pushes us even further to a

00:39:12.528 --> 00:39:16.371
desire for superiority.
Eve entertains the lovely

00:39:16.371 --> 00:39:19.829
thought of being -- and isn't
this a wonderful phrase!

00:39:19.829 --> 00:39:24.646
-- "sometime / Superior," as if
Adam and Eve could assume

00:39:24.646 --> 00:39:29.461
different positions on the
hierarchical ladder at will --

00:39:29.461 --> 00:39:34.449
as if Adam and Eve could "either
rung assume" or both,

00:39:34.449 --> 00:39:37.099
just as Milton's angels can
"either sex assume."

00:39:37.099 --> 00:39:41.286
The suppression of equality
even pushes Eve to that

00:39:41.286 --> 00:39:45.304
perfectly illogical but
completely understandable

00:39:45.304 --> 00:39:49.239
formulation: she'd like to be
"more equal,"

00:39:49.239 --> 00:39:52.010
as if equality could be
quantified in some way;

00:39:52.010 --> 00:39:56.075
as if equality weren't a
relational phenomenon,

00:39:56.075 --> 00:40:00.760
a structural phenomenon,
but one that could be assumed

00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:06.416
entirely by oneself and one that
could be hoarded and kept within

00:40:06.416 --> 00:40:11.068
the self in quantity.Now,
according to the official

00:40:11.068 --> 00:40:14.186
doctrine of the poem,
the moment of Eve's eating of

00:40:14.186 --> 00:40:17.740
the fruit is the origin of the
original human condition of

00:40:17.740 --> 00:40:20.920
fallen-ness.
Man lived until this time in a

00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:25.089
state of paradisal perfection,
and it's out of an absolutely

00:40:25.089 --> 00:40:29.329
free will that man chooses to
disobey the divine command.

00:40:29.329 --> 00:40:32.800
But the narrative that Milton
employs to illustrate this

00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:36.082
official doctrine seems
continually to be questioning

00:40:36.082 --> 00:40:39.827
just that assumption.
Milton's poetry seems to

00:40:39.827 --> 00:40:44.884
counter this belief in Edenic
perfection and counter this

00:40:44.884 --> 00:40:48.586
belief, even,
in Edenic freedom before the

00:40:48.586 --> 00:40:51.805
Fall.
There's a sense in Paradise

00:40:51.805 --> 00:40:56.436
Lost that Adam and Eve --
and I know this is heretical --

00:40:56.436 --> 00:40:59.369
were never completely free in
Eden.

00:40:59.369 --> 00:41:03.298
They were always burdened by a
set of cultural constraints of

00:41:03.298 --> 00:41:06.767
which the prohibition of the
fruit was simply the most

00:41:06.767 --> 00:41:09.675
outrageous,
but certainly not the only,

00:41:09.675 --> 00:41:14.275
one.Look at page 402.
This is another important

00:41:14.275 --> 00:41:18.010
moment after the Fall,
line 1051.

00:41:18.010 --> 00:41:22.139
This is the moment in which
Adam and Eve wake up after their

00:41:22.139 --> 00:41:25.570
first act of sexual intercourse
after the Fall.

00:41:25.570 --> 00:41:28.321
This is their first attempt at
fallen sleep which,

00:41:28.321 --> 00:41:31.130
of course, doesn't turn out to
be that pleasant.

00:41:31.130 --> 00:41:37.159
So: [U]p they roseAs
from unrest, and each the other

00:41:37.159 --> 00:41:43.485
viewing,Soon found thir Eyes
how op'nd, and thir mindsHow

00:41:43.485 --> 00:41:46.389
dark'n'd;
innocence, that as a

00:41:46.389 --> 00:41:51.246
veilHad shadow'd them from
knowing ill, was gone,Just

00:41:51.246 --> 00:41:53.107
confidence,
and native

00:41:53.107 --> 00:41:57.473
righteousness,And honor from
about them, naked leftTo

00:41:57.473 --> 00:42:00.476
guilty shame...
So this is Milton's version of

00:42:00.476 --> 00:42:03.078
the Genesis text.
This is what Genesis tells us:

00:42:03.078 --> 00:42:06.590
"he eyes of both were opened,
and they knew that they were

00:42:06.590 --> 00:42:09.493
naked..."
They've awakened to a new form

00:42:09.493 --> 00:42:12.666
of consciousness,
but Milton wants us to know

00:42:12.666 --> 00:42:17.025
that this new form of knowledge,
this new self-consciousness,

00:42:17.025 --> 00:42:19.780
isn't an enlightenment:
it's a darkening.

00:42:19.780 --> 00:42:24.760
"hir minds / How dark'n'd,"
Milton explains.But it's so

00:42:24.760 --> 00:42:29.187
much more complicated than that.
No sooner has Milton depicted

00:42:29.187 --> 00:42:32.098
the Fall as a darkening than he
does something incredibly

00:42:32.098 --> 00:42:34.398
strange.
He describes the Fall from

00:42:34.398 --> 00:42:38.121
innocence as if the Fall were in
itself something like an

00:42:38.121 --> 00:42:40.050
enlightenment:
"innocence,

00:42:40.050 --> 00:42:43.598
that as a veil / Had shadow'd
them from knowing ill,

00:42:43.598 --> 00:42:46.165
was goneâ€¦"
There's an incredibly

00:42:46.165 --> 00:42:49.309
complicated but wonderfully
contradictory interplay of

00:42:49.309 --> 00:42:52.476
lightening and darkening,
and the imagery here begins to

00:42:52.476 --> 00:42:54.524
deconstruct itself.
On the one hand,

00:42:54.524 --> 00:42:57.855
the Fall darkens their minds,
and on the other hand,

00:42:57.855 --> 00:43:01.577
they're enlightened as the
shadowy veil is lifted.It's

00:43:01.577 --> 00:43:05.300
at this moment that the poem
seems to expose the fictional

00:43:05.300 --> 00:43:09.480
status of its representation of
something like a perfect,

00:43:09.480 --> 00:43:12.661
unfallen innocence.
Surely we expected Milton to

00:43:12.661 --> 00:43:14.219
say something completely
different.

00:43:14.219 --> 00:43:18.083
Surely we expected Milton to
say that innocence was the

00:43:18.083 --> 00:43:21.597
natural, naked Adam and Eve,
and that this innocent

00:43:21.597 --> 00:43:25.390
nakedness is now being covered
with a veil, a veil of guilt or

00:43:25.390 --> 00:43:27.940
a veil of shame -- but Milton's
doing,

00:43:27.940 --> 00:43:31.230
of course, exactly the opposite.
What does he say?

00:43:31.230 --> 00:43:36.411
Innocence was itself the veil.
The very idea of their perfect,

00:43:36.411 --> 00:43:40.666
unfallen state was the veil;
the very notion that Adam and

00:43:40.666 --> 00:43:43.690
Eve ever lived in a free
paradise was a veil.

00:43:43.690 --> 00:43:47.304
It was a fiction,
it was a false covering -- a

00:43:47.304 --> 00:43:51.640
veil thrown over the Edenic
society that was always and

00:43:51.640 --> 00:43:56.539
already a product of fallen
cultural constraints.Now,

00:43:56.539 --> 00:43:59.582
I don't need to remind you of
this because I know this is what

00:43:59.582 --> 00:44:01.841
you're thinking.
We have, of course,

00:44:01.841 --> 00:44:06.070
run into the image of the veil
before in Paradise Lost.

00:44:06.070 --> 00:44:08.656
An image of the veil
appeared in the description in

00:44:08.656 --> 00:44:12.225
the length of Eve's hair,
and remember that was a fact of

00:44:12.225 --> 00:44:16.556
culture that was being mistaken
by the narrator as a fact of

00:44:16.556 --> 00:44:17.893
nature.
In Book Four,

00:44:17.893 --> 00:44:20.541
line 304, the narrator -- and
you don't need to move there

00:44:20.541 --> 00:44:23.375
because you remember these lines
-- the narrator tells us that

00:44:23.375 --> 00:44:25.750
Eve:
[A]s a veil down to the

00:44:25.750 --> 00:44:29.110
slender waistHer unadorned
golden tresses wore

00:44:29.110 --> 00:44:31.969
Disshevell'd,
but in wanton ringlets wav'd

00:44:31.969 --> 00:44:35.760
As the Vine curles her
tendrils, which impli'd

00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:39.334
Subjection...
Our first understanding of

00:44:39.334 --> 00:44:42.759
Eve's subjection to Adam was
derived from the length of Eve's

00:44:42.759 --> 00:44:45.895
hair, which she wore as a veil.
A veil, of course,

00:44:45.895 --> 00:44:49.971
is only worn to hide something.
It's a covering of a source of

00:44:49.971 --> 00:44:54.070
shame that in this case may have
seemed to be Eve's nakedness,

00:44:54.070 --> 00:44:57.285
but that equation of Eve's hair
with a veil took place -- think

00:44:57.285 --> 00:44:59.652
of it.
It took place before the Fall,

00:44:59.652 --> 00:45:03.548
before nakedness was shameful.
The poem seemed to raise the

00:45:03.548 --> 00:45:07.438
possibility that there was
actually never a moment at which

00:45:07.438 --> 00:45:11.463
Adam and Eve were entirely free
from the kinds of constraints

00:45:11.463 --> 00:45:15.353
and the kinds of prohibitions
that we associate with fallen

00:45:15.353 --> 00:45:18.854
culture,
with culture after the breaking

00:45:18.854 --> 00:45:23.603
of the prohibition.It's,
of course, no accident that the

00:45:23.603 --> 00:45:28.270
image of the veil occurs in Book
Nine in the context of our

00:45:28.270 --> 00:45:32.777
introduction to Edenic hierarchy
and to the fact of Eve's

00:45:32.777 --> 00:45:37.908
subordinate status,
because the Fall itself seems

00:45:37.908 --> 00:45:42.204
in so many ways,
I think, to be one of the

00:45:42.204 --> 00:45:48.699
cultural consequences of this
fact of sexual subordination.

00:45:48.699 --> 00:45:52.140
Milton's strange image of the
veil of innocence in Book Nine

00:45:52.140 --> 00:45:54.645
-- what is this?
This is a paradox,

00:45:54.645 --> 00:45:58.848
a rhetorical paradox,
and this paradox announces what

00:45:58.848 --> 00:46:02.971
is essentially the paradoxical
construction of Eden,

00:46:02.971 --> 00:46:05.877
of Milton's Eden.
On the official,

00:46:05.877 --> 00:46:08.344
on the doctrinal,
level of the poem,

00:46:08.344 --> 00:46:12.220
the falling of this veil of
innocence exposes Adam's and

00:46:12.220 --> 00:46:15.178
Eve's nakedness.
It's a sign of their new fallen

00:46:15.178 --> 00:46:18.794
consciousness of their shame.
That's how we're supposed to be

00:46:18.794 --> 00:46:21.119
reading, presumably,
this image;

00:46:21.119 --> 00:46:24.045
but this paradoxical image also
works on that other level,

00:46:24.045 --> 00:46:26.510
on the much more subversive
level of the poem.

00:46:26.510 --> 00:46:31.539
It exposes a structural flaw at
the heart of Milton's paradise.

00:46:31.539 --> 00:46:35.794
Milton lets the doctrinal veil
fall from the poem,

00:46:35.794 --> 00:46:40.916
and he exposes his own alliance
here -- and I really believe

00:46:40.916 --> 00:46:46.300
this -- with Eve's critique of
Eden's arbitrary hierarchy.

00:46:46.300 --> 00:46:52.423
It's as if Milton had torn the
veil of dogma from his poem and

00:46:52.423 --> 00:46:57.442
he's begun to realize what Eve
has known all along:

00:46:57.442 --> 00:47:02.060
"Eden were no Eden thus
expos'd."Okay.

00:47:02.060 --> 00:47:03.060
That's it.

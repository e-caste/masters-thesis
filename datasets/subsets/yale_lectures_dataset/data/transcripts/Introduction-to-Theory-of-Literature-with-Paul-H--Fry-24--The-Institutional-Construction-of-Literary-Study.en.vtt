00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:07.525
Prof: We've been passing
through a variety of discourses

00:00:07.525 --> 00:00:11.360
concerning the nature of
identity,

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.750
the way in which identity is
constructed--

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.210
incidentally with varying
degrees of emphasis,

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.130
the way in which identity is
constructed in literature.

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.309
I'm going to come back to this
perhaps missing link,

00:00:26.309 --> 00:00:28.440
literature, in a minute.
 

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.532
In the meantime,
I just wanted to point out

00:00:31.532 --> 00:00:35.508
something that I'm sure you've
inferred for yourselves:

00:00:35.508 --> 00:00:39.705
namely that each one of these
approaches to identity has a

00:00:39.705 --> 00:00:43.379
history,
and that the history results in

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.854
a recent chapter which is
something like what you might

00:00:47.854 --> 00:00:53.270
call a deconstructive moment,
signifying on theory itself

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:59.427
such that the claim of theory as
a mainstream discourse to hold

00:00:59.427 --> 00:01:04.688
certain views is something that
in and of itself,

00:01:04.688 --> 00:01:10.040
from a subversive perspective,
needs to be deconstructed and

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.219
undermined.
 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.116
There is the idea in
postcolonial studies of

00:01:16.116 --> 00:01:21.080
hybridity as the undermining of
cultural binaries--

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.043
that is, the double
consciousness in which one

00:01:25.043 --> 00:01:30.064
experiences simultaneously a
kind of identification with a

00:01:30.064 --> 00:01:34.030
state apparatus and a will to
subvert it.

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.384
By the way, I thought I'd give
you another example of how that

00:01:38.384 --> 00:01:40.739
works because it applies to me.
 

00:01:40.739 --> 00:01:46.180
I don't actually watch talk
shows very often,

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.530
but should I be watching a talk
show,

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.263
they often invite people on to
these shows whom they call

00:01:52.263 --> 00:01:53.129
professors.
 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:02.343
I just wanted to point out to
you the degree to which the sly

00:02:02.343 --> 00:02:05.236
civility,
the hybrid sly civility with

00:02:05.236 --> 00:02:08.271
which people are called
"professors,"

00:02:08.271 --> 00:02:12.229
is for a professor one of the
most discouraging sounds in the

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:15.150
language,
because they know very well

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.509
when someone is addressed by a
talk show host as

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:21.942
"professor"
what they mean is you are a

00:02:21.942 --> 00:02:22.800
pedant.
 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.300
You don't know how to park a
bicycle straight.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.220
You have no understanding of
the real world.

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.258
I don't know why I've invited
you on this show in the first

00:02:30.258 --> 00:02:31.419
place, &gt;
 

00:02:31.419 --> 00:02:34.120
except somebody told me you
were an expert.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:41.080
That's what it means in the
public sphere to be a professor.

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:46.095
Bhabha perhaps exaggerates a
little bit when he says the

00:02:46.095 --> 00:02:51.750
discourse of hybridity has an
element of terrorism about it.

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.587
Bhabha is writing long ago
before 9/11 and so on and

00:02:55.587 --> 00:02:58.750
perhaps uses the term a little
loosely,

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.538
but I have to say when I hear
somebody addressing me,

00:03:03.538 --> 00:03:06.090
someone not in the
academy--because of course,

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.188
people have contempt for me in
the academy,

00:03:08.188 --> 00:03:10.348
too, but it's a more
complicated thing.

00:03:10.348 --> 00:03:13.353
They may not have contempt for
other professors,

00:03:13.353 --> 00:03:16.740
if you see what I mean,
so that's more complicated.

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:20.096
But when someone not in the
academy addresses me as

00:03:20.096 --> 00:03:23.453
"professor,"
I suppose I can't say that I

00:03:23.453 --> 00:03:26.770
feel terrorized exactly,
but I do feel depressed.

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:28.158
&gt;
 

00:03:28.158 --> 00:03:35.125
That's an important part of the
double consciousness of the

00:03:35.125 --> 00:03:39.930
subaltern, as Bhabha expatiates
on it.

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.204
Then in any case,
finally there is the

00:03:42.204 --> 00:03:45.645
deconstructive moment of gender
theory in which gender is

00:03:45.645 --> 00:03:48.904
understood not as something
essential but as something

00:03:48.904 --> 00:03:51.198
performed--
something brought into

00:03:51.198 --> 00:03:54.147
existence not just by verbal
discourse but by all the

00:03:54.147 --> 00:03:57.190
semiotic systems,
including gesture,

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:02.947
dress, and all the rest of it
that constitutes the way in

00:04:02.947 --> 00:04:06.340
which gender comes into being.
 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:11.117
Now in each case you have
instances of knowledge as

00:04:11.117 --> 00:04:12.169
negation.
 

00:04:12.169 --> 00:04:16.581
I'm just trying to pull this
back into the perspective of

00:04:16.581 --> 00:04:21.310
what we recognize perhaps more
readily as literary theory.

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:23.824
By "knowledge as
negation"

00:04:23.824 --> 00:04:28.440
I mean semiotic knowledge,
something that I've been trying

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:33.339
to stress really as a central
theme throughout this course.

00:04:33.339 --> 00:04:36.427
"I am--well,
I don't know what I am,

00:04:36.427 --> 00:04:39.899
but I'll tell you this:
I'm not that."

00:04:39.899 --> 00:04:43.267
In other words,
the way in which I come to

00:04:43.267 --> 00:04:47.494
understand myself as not that--
and I, of course,

00:04:47.494 --> 00:04:51.949
am the person who possesses
hegemonic discourse,

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:55.884
so I see myself,
I come to understand myself for

00:04:55.884 --> 00:05:00.990
the first time in the argument
of a Toni Morrison or an Edward

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.180
Said or,
in a certain sense,

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:04.338
of a Judith Butler.
 

00:05:04.338 --> 00:05:08.141
I come to understand,
in a way, for the first time

00:05:08.141 --> 00:05:12.204
when I reflect on what I'm not--
that is to say,

00:05:12.204 --> 00:05:18.089
when I try to objectify or to
pigeonhole that which I'm not,

00:05:18.089 --> 00:05:22.699
which is of course not what I'm
really not but what I suppose

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:24.160
myself not to be.
 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:30.776
In all of these ways then,
you can see that the way in

00:05:30.776 --> 00:05:33.663
which,
according to the sorts of

00:05:33.663 --> 00:05:37.190
thinking we have been reviewing
in recent weeks,

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:43.175
one comes to understand oneself
is precisely negative in the

00:05:43.175 --> 00:05:48.451
tradition of semiotic and
formalist understandings of

00:05:48.451 --> 00:05:49.769
language.
 

00:05:49.769 --> 00:05:53.660
I am not at all necessarily
what I am.

00:05:53.660 --> 00:06:01.088
I am precisely as I understand
it not that, not the other;

00:06:01.088 --> 00:06:06.641
and I grasp myself perhaps in
ways that deepen my alleged

00:06:06.641 --> 00:06:12.889
understanding of myself as a
result of this negative process.

00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:13.670
All right.
 

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:18.593
So I say all these things again
to reassure you that we still

00:06:18.593 --> 00:06:21.629
are talking about literary
theory,

00:06:21.629 --> 00:06:26.291
that the ways of thinking about
things that we've encountered

00:06:26.291 --> 00:06:30.331
recently really do arise out of
issues given to us by

00:06:30.331 --> 00:06:34.916
deconstruction and by negation
in the semiotic and formalist

00:06:34.916 --> 00:06:36.160
tradition.
 

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:40.040
We can understand what has
happened basically--

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:45.959
this in terms of the overall
structure of the course--

00:06:45.959 --> 00:06:51.488
not as a change in the
structure of thought we examined

00:06:51.488 --> 00:06:56.913
when we took up language as the
primary determinant of

00:06:56.913 --> 00:07:01.100
understanding,
but as a transformation of

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:03.293
language--
the determinant of social

00:07:03.293 --> 00:07:06.197
understanding--
into what we call "a

00:07:06.197 --> 00:07:10.374
social text";
so that our head now is not the

00:07:10.374 --> 00:07:13.778
repository of Saussure's
langue,

00:07:13.778 --> 00:07:18.721
that is something that just
sits there in and of itself as a

00:07:18.721 --> 00:07:21.661
system,
but rather it's full of other

00:07:21.661 --> 00:07:23.040
people's language.
 

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:28.851
It is a space in which society
itself understood as discourse

00:07:28.851 --> 00:07:34.278
jostles for attention and
struggles somehow or another to

00:07:34.278 --> 00:07:37.959
shape itself into
intelligibility.

00:07:37.959 --> 00:07:40.990
That's the fundamental change.
 

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:47.281
Language is still preeminent in
the kinds of thinking that we've

00:07:47.281 --> 00:07:48.579
been doing.
 

00:07:48.579 --> 00:07:51.083
We haven't really gotten away
from language,

00:07:51.083 --> 00:07:54.110
but we have altered our
understanding of language.

00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:56.730
Language is now a social text.
 

00:07:56.730 --> 00:08:00.819
It is now, in Bakhtin's words,
other people's language,

00:08:00.819 --> 00:08:03.769
and we understand it therefore
not--

00:08:03.769 --> 00:08:06.608
and of course,
semiotics and deconstruction

00:08:06.608 --> 00:08:09.379
don't understand it as our own
either,

00:08:09.379 --> 00:08:11.329
because language always
precedes us;

00:08:11.329 --> 00:08:15.564
but we understand it more
clearly as something that is

00:08:15.564 --> 00:08:20.199
given to us as a social
formation that in turn forms us.

00:08:20.199 --> 00:08:25.903
In a way that does bring us to
our topic today because this

00:08:25.903 --> 00:08:29.180
topic,
almost the last topic of the

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:31.795
course,
has to do with the

00:08:31.795 --> 00:08:35.178
preconditions of interpretation.
 

00:08:35.178 --> 00:08:39.288
What makes it possible for us
to think something?

00:08:39.288 --> 00:08:43.726
How is it that we come to think
one thing as opposed to another

00:08:43.726 --> 00:08:44.298
thing?
 

00:08:44.298 --> 00:08:48.529
How is it that there are areas
of agreement among us?

00:08:48.529 --> 00:08:51.452
How is it, for that matter,
that there are areas of

00:08:51.452 --> 00:08:54.258
disagreement among us and indeed
that these areas

00:08:54.258 --> 00:08:57.240
characteristically seem to be so
nonnegotiable?

00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:58.379
&gt;
 

00:08:58.379 --> 00:09:02.457
The point arises at which we
just can't find ourselves in

00:09:02.457 --> 00:09:06.754
agreement on things just as the
point arises when we realize

00:09:06.754 --> 00:09:11.778
that we are in some profound way
in agreement about other things.

00:09:11.778 --> 00:09:15.178
How is it that all of this
comes to be?

00:09:15.178 --> 00:09:22.322
In order to do that,
let's first go back to Tony

00:09:22.322 --> 00:09:25.178
the Tow Truck.
 

00:09:25.178 --> 00:09:27.796
Because we've said all along
that it's about whatever it is

00:09:27.796 --> 00:09:29.509
that we happen to be talking
about,

00:09:29.509 --> 00:09:33.923
let's think about Tony
once again as being about

00:09:33.923 --> 00:09:37.519
the things we've been discussing
recently.

00:09:37.519 --> 00:09:43.139
We can say, for example,
that Tony is a Marxist

00:09:43.139 --> 00:09:49.288
contestation of the social
determinacy of identity in other

00:09:49.288 --> 00:09:50.350
forms.
 

00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:53.530
It's a realist text because,
as we've said before,

00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:54.700
nothing happens.
 

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:58.839
There is no change in the
social formations that are the

00:09:58.839 --> 00:10:03.434
givens of the story,
but it nevertheless does lay

00:10:03.434 --> 00:10:09.167
out the relationship among
social norms in ways that show

00:10:09.167 --> 00:10:14.080
that life goes on despite social
inequality,

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:16.932
despite--of course here I'm
going to throw something at you

00:10:16.932 --> 00:10:19.932
that you perhaps hadn't thought
of so much in terms of Tony

00:10:19.932 --> 00:10:23.091
before--
despite ethnic and gender

00:10:23.091 --> 00:10:24.230
difference.
 

00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:27.240
Now what happens then in
Tony, to move to a

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:30.129
slightly different way of
thinking about it,

00:10:30.129 --> 00:10:34.580
is we can see that it's a
global story masked as a story

00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:38.058
of hybridity in the American
melting pot.

00:10:38.058 --> 00:10:43.009
It should have been perfectly
plain to you all along that Tony

00:10:43.009 --> 00:10:47.634
is an Italian American with the
complex personality of the

00:10:47.634 --> 00:10:48.769
subaltern.
 

00:10:48.769 --> 00:10:51.188
On the one hand,
he believes in the American

00:10:51.188 --> 00:10:51.639
dream.
 

00:10:51.639 --> 00:10:53.940
He likes his job.
 

00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:56.559
He buys into the system,
in other words,

00:10:56.559 --> 00:11:00.187
but on the other hand he
recognizes that he has his own

00:11:00.187 --> 00:11:03.480
place in the world,
the little yellow garage.

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:09.746
It's his niche in the world and
it's something that is partly

00:11:09.746 --> 00:11:13.090
what affords him his identity.
 

00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:17.524
Neato, of course,
on the other hand is the

00:11:17.524 --> 00:11:21.418
neurotic WASP in the manor
house,

00:11:21.418 --> 00:11:24.548
sort of representing that sort
of class,

00:11:24.548 --> 00:11:27.711
and Speedy very interestingly
is a member of what John

00:11:27.711 --> 00:11:30.514
Guillory calls "the
professional/managerial

00:11:30.514 --> 00:11:31.470
class."
 

00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:37.101
What's interesting about Speedy
is that suddenly we realize that

00:11:37.101 --> 00:11:40.298
his ethnic origins,
his class origins,

00:11:40.298 --> 00:11:43.658
and even his gender--
because he may be a woman--are

00:11:43.658 --> 00:11:47.378
not perhaps as relevant as one
might have imagined them to be

00:11:47.378 --> 00:11:50.043
because the
professional/managerial class is

00:11:50.043 --> 00:11:52.783
interesting--
as Guillory's source,

00:11:52.783 --> 00:11:56.548
Alvin Gouldner,
points out at length--precisely

00:11:56.548 --> 00:12:01.365
as the emergence of a body of
people with common interests who

00:12:01.365 --> 00:12:05.024
really can't be said,
at least, to derive from,

00:12:05.024 --> 00:12:07.720
or perhaps in a way even to
belong to,

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:10.139
a common class.
 

00:12:10.139 --> 00:12:13.907
Speedy is certainly in Tony
the Tow Truck a

00:12:13.907 --> 00:12:17.288
representative of this new
emerging class.

00:12:17.288 --> 00:12:19.620
Perhaps it's no accident that
Neato comes first.

00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:23.350
I think memory serves me in
saying that Neato comes first in

00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:26.764
the sort of folkloric triad
because Neato represents an

00:12:26.764 --> 00:12:29.559
older class,
a class which in a certain

00:12:29.559 --> 00:12:33.399
sense is giving way to the
professional/managerial class.

00:12:33.399 --> 00:12:37.835
It makes sense that first you
get Neato and then you would get

00:12:37.835 --> 00:12:38.490
Speedy.
 

00:12:38.490 --> 00:12:41.658
So then we can also think of
Tony the Tow Truck,

00:12:41.658 --> 00:12:43.658
of course,
in terms of gender.

00:12:43.658 --> 00:12:45.460
We've said there are no women
in it,

00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:49.261
and yet at the same time you do
have those frowning and smiling

00:12:49.261 --> 00:12:52.389
houses sort of embodying the
angel in the house,

00:12:52.389 --> 00:12:54.149
but it's not just that.
 

00:12:54.149 --> 00:12:57.101
Obviously, Neato--I've never
drawn a picture of Neato but

00:12:57.101 --> 00:12:59.788
with his little bow tie and his
prissy "Oh,

00:12:59.788 --> 00:13:03.830
I don't want to get dirty"
he's just a bundle of gay

00:13:03.830 --> 00:13:04.840
stereotypes.
 

00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:06.080
&gt;
 

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:09.767
Then obviously with Bumpy,
he pushes and pushes--you don't

00:13:09.767 --> 00:13:11.320
even want to go there.
 

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:13.500
&gt;
 

00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:17.933
In any case,
this is plainly a story about

00:13:17.933 --> 00:13:24.639
gender, and so you can see that
it's about all these things.

00:13:24.639 --> 00:13:29.671
So then here is the question,
and it really does provide us

00:13:29.671 --> 00:13:34.615
with our transition to today's
materials: what have I been

00:13:34.615 --> 00:13:39.038
doing all this time with Tony
the Tow Truck?

00:13:39.038 --> 00:13:43.238
I've been doing exactly,
as you can see now,

00:13:43.238 --> 00:13:47.168
what Fish does with Jacobs,
Rosenbaum, Levin,

00:13:47.168 --> 00:13:49.850
Thorne, Hayes,
and Ohmann.

00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:53.562
I've been showing that if you
bring a certain supposition to

00:13:53.562 --> 00:13:56.928
what you're reading,
you're going to perform a

00:13:56.928 --> 00:14:01.898
certain kind of hermeneutic act,
not with any particular strain

00:14:01.898 --> 00:14:06.379
but more or less spontaneously
because that's what you are

00:14:06.379 --> 00:14:08.028
conditioned to do.
 

00:14:08.028 --> 00:14:13.749
Now Fish's class had no trouble
construing the assignment for

00:14:13.749 --> 00:14:17.602
his previous class as a poem,
and you can see,

00:14:17.602 --> 00:14:20.567
of course, that it was sort of
ready to hand to be construed

00:14:20.567 --> 00:14:21.168
that way.
 

00:14:21.168 --> 00:14:24.244
Fish admits that,
but he's lecturing some people

00:14:24.244 --> 00:14:28.235
in Kenyon College and he just
sort of runs his finger down the

00:14:28.235 --> 00:14:32.014
list of faculty names and says,
"Look what I could do with

00:14:32.014 --> 00:14:32.889
these names."
 

00:14:32.889 --> 00:14:37.010
I think he does make his point
because you can do it with

00:14:37.010 --> 00:14:38.629
absolutely anything.
 

00:14:38.629 --> 00:14:42.160
We can see, of course,
that his class actually missed

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:43.178
a few points.
 

00:14:43.178 --> 00:14:47.350
It forgot to mention that an
ancient and important meaning of

00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:50.340
the word "Levin"
is lightning,

00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:56.013
so that a flash of revelation
is entailed in any religious

00:14:56.013 --> 00:14:58.798
understanding of the poem.
 

00:14:58.798 --> 00:15:01.687
It's almost impossible to
understand why his class was

00:15:01.687 --> 00:15:03.649
stumped by the word
"Hayes"

00:15:03.649 --> 00:15:07.147
because "Hayes"--
well, we see things through a

00:15:07.147 --> 00:15:08.019
glass darkly.
 

00:15:08.019 --> 00:15:12.241
We see them in a haze,
and that's exactly the way in

00:15:12.241 --> 00:15:16.711
which we're likely to respond to
instances of religious

00:15:16.711 --> 00:15:21.596
revelation as they are given in
the devotional poetry of the

00:15:21.596 --> 00:15:23.750
seventeenth century.
 

00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:26.604
In any case,
what we've been doing with

00:15:26.604 --> 00:15:29.908
Tony the Tow Truck is of
this kind.

00:15:29.908 --> 00:15:32.570
We've taken a text with a--by
the way,

00:15:32.570 --> 00:15:37.073
you may want to know whether I
think Tony is really

00:15:37.073 --> 00:15:41.418
about something as opposed to
about all those things.

00:15:41.418 --> 00:15:44.269
Well, I actually do,
and I mentioned it in passing,

00:15:44.269 --> 00:15:49.361
but it's only an intuition and
it really doesn't arise out of

00:15:49.361 --> 00:15:54.200
any particular predilections I
have for psychoanalysis.

00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:58.317
It does seem to me,
however, that a story written

00:15:58.317 --> 00:16:03.120
to that age group in which the
climactic line is "He

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:08.524
pushed and he pushed and I'm on
my way" is pretty obviously

00:16:08.524 --> 00:16:13.500
about one thing as opposed to a
lot of other things.

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:18.495
If you really pushed me about
what Tony the Tow Truck

00:16:18.495 --> 00:16:20.993
is about,
I would say,

00:16:20.993 --> 00:16:25.688
"Well, I think it's an
anal phase parable and that

00:16:25.688 --> 00:16:30.558
Robert Kraus very possibly wrote
it for that purpose.

00:16:30.558 --> 00:16:33.688
In other words,
this would engage the attention

00:16:33.688 --> 00:16:37.840
of the toddler who is having the
story read to him or her,

00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:42.496
and its meaningfulness probably
is going to come across to the

00:16:42.496 --> 00:16:47.154
toddler in that way perhaps in
more pronounced fashion than in

00:16:47.154 --> 00:16:49.956
any other--
certainly and obviously in a

00:16:49.956 --> 00:16:53.446
more pronounced fashion than
most of the ways in which we've

00:16:53.446 --> 00:16:55.279
been talking about the text.
 

00:16:55.279 --> 00:17:00.759
So that's what I think.
 

00:17:00.759 --> 00:17:03.889
Of course, I've disclaimed any
connection with psychoanalysis

00:17:03.889 --> 00:17:06.288
but nevertheless I know
something about it,

00:17:06.288 --> 00:17:09.190
and so that's part of my
interpretive community.

00:17:09.190 --> 00:17:10.990
We'll get back to that.
 

00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:15.375
In any case,
we've been treating Tony the

00:17:15.375 --> 00:17:20.068
Tow Truck in this way and we
have been,

00:17:20.068 --> 00:17:22.568
well, nodding our heads and
saying,

00:17:22.568 --> 00:17:24.190
"Yeah, yeah,
it's about that,

00:17:24.190 --> 00:17:26.319
too," and "Guess so,
yeah.

00:17:26.319 --> 00:17:27.538
Interesting, isn't it?
 

00:17:27.538 --> 00:17:30.048
Wonder what it's going to be
about on Thursday."

00:17:30.048 --> 00:17:35.221
We've been doing this because
we belong to an interpretive

00:17:35.221 --> 00:17:36.308
community.
 

00:17:36.308 --> 00:17:40.348
Now I want immediately to add
here two caveats.

00:17:40.348 --> 00:17:43.780
I would say that within the
interpretive community that

00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:46.856
makes up this room,
a community of people who are

00:17:46.856 --> 00:17:50.558
interested in interpretation,
you probably have suspected all

00:17:50.558 --> 00:17:54.376
along that interpretation was a
mug's game and therefore wanted

00:17:54.376 --> 00:17:58.380
to take a course of this kind to
find out just how bad it was.

00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:03.167
All of us at least have in
common a concern with the

00:18:03.167 --> 00:18:08.425
potential complexity of those
circumstances that surround

00:18:08.425 --> 00:18:10.210
interpretation.
 

00:18:10.210 --> 00:18:14.346
We are an interpretive
community that's interested in

00:18:14.346 --> 00:18:17.368
interpretation,
so we play the game.

00:18:17.368 --> 00:18:21.288
However, I would hazard that
within this interpretive

00:18:21.288 --> 00:18:25.660
community there are two
sub-communities which probably,

00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:28.615
in a certain sense,
while they see the significance

00:18:28.615 --> 00:18:32.320
of the exercise,
nevertheless want to hold out

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:33.390
against it.
 

00:18:33.390 --> 00:18:39.741
One of them is the community
which either always has or has

00:18:39.741 --> 00:18:44.747
now come to have a very,
very strong commitment to one

00:18:44.747 --> 00:18:48.983
or another point of view that's
been passed in review in this

00:18:48.983 --> 00:18:53.148
course and who therefore finds
it demeaning of the important

00:18:53.148 --> 00:18:57.455
point of view that it would be
treated simply in a survey in a

00:18:57.455 --> 00:19:01.692
serial way with all sorts of
other points of view that may or

00:19:01.692 --> 00:19:04.798
may not supplant or jostle with
it.

00:19:04.798 --> 00:19:09.200
Now this takes us back to the
remarks I was making at the

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:14.151
beginning about the way in which
one can perhaps acknowledge the

00:19:14.151 --> 00:19:18.788
usefulness of a survey course
but nevertheless bridle at the

00:19:18.788 --> 00:19:22.009
very idea of a survey course
when,

00:19:22.009 --> 00:19:25.278
after all, the only thing that
matters is Marx's thought.

00:19:25.278 --> 00:19:29.083
Why do we spend any time with
all of these other approaches to

00:19:29.083 --> 00:19:32.710
things and so on--
just sort of whichever form of

00:19:32.710 --> 00:19:36.440
thought is the only thing that
matters to you.

00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:41.285
This would probably lead you to
say not so much that Tony

00:19:41.285 --> 00:19:45.308
is only about this one thing
but "Oh,

00:19:45.308 --> 00:19:49.821
this is a really facile and
irrelevant exercise because the

00:19:49.821 --> 00:19:54.490
important thing is to take this
one thing seriously."

00:19:54.490 --> 00:19:58.703
The implication is that if you
take a lot of other things in

00:19:58.703 --> 00:20:02.490
review, you're not taking this
one thing seriously.

00:20:02.490 --> 00:20:05.403
So that might be one
sub-community within our

00:20:05.403 --> 00:20:07.058
interpretive community.
 

00:20:07.058 --> 00:20:09.856
Another one might be a
sub-community that is still

00:20:09.856 --> 00:20:12.708
committed,
as one's tempted to say,

00:20:12.708 --> 00:20:17.005
to high culture and says,
"I think we should have

00:20:17.005 --> 00:20:20.720
used 'Lycidas' or 'The Rhyme of
the Ancient Mariner.'

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:24.222
It was demeaning to high
culture to use Tony the Tow

00:20:24.222 --> 00:20:28.181
Truck and furthermore,"
this sub-community might very

00:20:28.181 --> 00:20:31.230
well say,
"if we had used 'Lycidas'

00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:35.509
or 'The Rhyme of the Ancient
Mariner,' a certain approach,

00:20:35.509 --> 00:20:39.230
a certain way of reading either
of those poems,

00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:42.808
would have made sense
self-evidently--

00:20:42.808 --> 00:20:46.410
meaning that all of the other
approaches are trivial."

00:20:46.410 --> 00:20:50.345
If your commitment is not so
much to one point of view as to

00:20:50.345 --> 00:20:54.054
some idea of high culture,
you're not going to say in

00:20:54.054 --> 00:20:58.067
advance which approach it is,
but you're going to suppose

00:20:58.067 --> 00:21:02.214
that somehow or another such is
the value and nature of high

00:21:02.214 --> 00:21:06.713
culture that it will be possible
to arrive at a sort of consensus

00:21:06.713 --> 00:21:10.368
view of what's going on in one
of its products.

00:21:10.368 --> 00:21:14.753
This is what Guillory is
talking about at least in part

00:21:14.753 --> 00:21:18.732
in his review of defenses of
Western civilization,

00:21:18.732 --> 00:21:21.170
Western culture and so on.
 

00:21:21.170 --> 00:21:22.349
They have a meaning.
 

00:21:22.349 --> 00:21:23.990
They have a continuity.
 

00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:28.272
They have a stability which is
worth preserving and which ought

00:21:28.272 --> 00:21:32.278
to be the central business of
the schools to promulgate.

00:21:32.278 --> 00:21:36.785
So those are possible
sub-communities within our

00:21:36.785 --> 00:21:41.218
interpretative community,
but we all do have in common

00:21:41.218 --> 00:21:44.589
the recognition that it's
possible to riff on a text in

00:21:44.589 --> 00:21:45.338
this way.
 

00:21:45.338 --> 00:21:49.121
If somebody does it,
we recognize that whether we

00:21:49.121 --> 00:21:53.463
like it or not,
we ourselves could probably do

00:21:53.463 --> 00:21:55.384
it ,too--
which is proof,

00:21:55.384 --> 00:21:58.601
from Stanley Fish's point of
view and also from John

00:21:58.601 --> 00:22:02.970
Guillory's point of view,
because we're in a school that

00:22:02.970 --> 00:22:05.680
we have a great deal in common.
 

00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:11.074
It's what we have in common
that brings the text into

00:22:11.074 --> 00:22:17.608
visibility in the variety of
ways that we've performed on it.

00:22:17.608 --> 00:22:22.647
Now with all of this said,
let's talk a little bit more

00:22:22.647 --> 00:22:27.220
about what an interpretive
community is first,

00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:31.412
according to Stanley Fish,
and then move to the point

00:22:31.412 --> 00:22:36.490
where we may wish to suggest one
form or another of criticism of

00:22:36.490 --> 00:22:37.618
this idea.
 

00:22:37.618 --> 00:22:44.186
Let's begin with Fish's first
sentence, which is on page 1023,

00:22:44.186 --> 00:22:47.308
the upper left-hand column.
 

00:22:47.308 --> 00:22:50.700
This is a series of lectures,
and so he begins by saying:

00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:55.567
Last time I sketched out an
argument by which meanings are

00:22:55.567 --> 00:23:00.775
the property neither of fixed
and stable texts nor of free and

00:23:00.775 --> 00:23:05.642
independent readers but of
interpretative communities that

00:23:05.642 --> 00:23:10.595
are responsible both for the
shape of a reader's activities

00:23:10.595 --> 00:23:14.950
and for the texts those
activities produce.

00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:17.948
I don't know that he really
carries his argument all that

00:23:17.948 --> 00:23:20.088
much farther forward in this
lecture,

00:23:20.088 --> 00:23:23.798
which is why I think it's
worthwhile to begin with this

00:23:23.798 --> 00:23:27.920
sentence because in some ways it
does anticipate what he then

00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:30.598
lays out once more in this
lecture.

00:23:30.598 --> 00:23:35.453
Now an interesting thing about
the career of Stanley Fish is

00:23:35.453 --> 00:23:39.104
that he actually,
in the course of that quite

00:23:39.104 --> 00:23:44.598
high-visibility career,
changed his mind twice.

00:23:44.598 --> 00:23:49.531
His changes of mind are
actually recorded residually in

00:23:49.531 --> 00:23:53.037
this essay that you read,
"How Do We Recognize a

00:23:53.037 --> 00:23:54.019
Poem when We See One?"
 

00:23:54.019 --> 00:23:56.717
which, by the way,
is a completely disingenuous

00:23:56.717 --> 00:23:58.769
title because we don't see
poems.

00:23:58.769 --> 00:23:59.670
&gt;
 

00:23:59.670 --> 00:24:02.319
That's the whole point.
 

00:24:02.319 --> 00:24:05.019
There is no poem there.
 

00:24:05.019 --> 00:24:07.048
If it's there,
it's because you put it there.

00:24:07.048 --> 00:24:11.698
In any case,
these changes of mind are

00:24:11.698 --> 00:24:15.970
residually present in this text.
 

00:24:15.970 --> 00:24:19.488
They are actually manifest in
the peculiar vagary of the

00:24:19.488 --> 00:24:23.454
argument of an earlier essay he
wrote called "Interpreting

00:24:23.454 --> 00:24:26.653
the Variorum,"
which is what was in the second

00:24:26.653 --> 00:24:29.150
edition of
&gt;

00:24:29.150 --> 00:24:33.049
the Richter anthology and the
one that I used to teach,

00:24:33.049 --> 00:24:37.313
but I think it's still worth
harkening back to those changes

00:24:37.313 --> 00:24:38.180
of mind.
 

00:24:38.180 --> 00:24:42.519
When I was his student at the
University of California,

00:24:42.519 --> 00:24:44.769
he held his first opinion.
 

00:24:44.769 --> 00:24:48.356
This was just before he
published Surprised by Sin:

00:24:48.356 --> 00:24:50.930
The Reader in Paradise
Lost,

00:24:50.930 --> 00:24:56.433
a book for which a seminar
that I was in was a kind of

00:24:56.433 --> 00:24:57.690
guinea pig.
 

00:24:57.690 --> 00:25:03.171
To give you an example of what
he meant by saying that a stable

00:25:03.171 --> 00:25:08.230
text produces a reader,
which was his first belief,

00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:14.267
I give you an example that he
uses from Milton about Satan's

00:25:14.267 --> 00:25:15.288
spirit.
 

00:25:15.288 --> 00:25:18.858
This is Satan standing by the
fiery lake.

00:25:18.858 --> 00:25:21.618
He's just pulled himself up to
his full height,

00:25:21.618 --> 00:25:24.078
he has a spear,
and Milton writes about it

00:25:24.078 --> 00:25:27.545
[points to board]:
His Spear, to equal which the

00:25:27.545 --> 00:25:30.781
tallest Pine [okay:
spear, pine about the same

00:25:30.781 --> 00:25:33.348
size]
Hewn… to be the Mast

00:25:33.348 --> 00:25:37.172
of some great Ammiral [well,
let's see, mast-pine-spear]

00:25:37.172 --> 00:25:40.509
were but a wand…
Then you realize that the

00:25:40.509 --> 00:25:44.430
sequence of sizes is completely
reversed and what you thought,

00:25:44.430 --> 00:25:46.769
what you'd already filled your
consciousness with--

00:25:46.769 --> 00:25:52.056
the tallest pine--is just a
wand compared with the size of

00:25:52.056 --> 00:25:53.539
Satan's spear.
 

00:25:53.539 --> 00:25:54.690
So what's he saying?
 

00:25:54.690 --> 00:26:00.759
He's saying you think that your
mind can grasp the magnitude of

00:26:00.759 --> 00:26:04.154
Satan,
you think you know how big

00:26:04.154 --> 00:26:07.665
Satan is,
but the language of Paradise

00:26:07.665 --> 00:26:12.213
Lost is going to teach you,
is going to educate you into

00:26:12.213 --> 00:26:16.380
realizing that you shouldn't
mess with Satan because Satan is

00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:18.880
much bigger than you think he
is.

00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:23.143
What I didn't write here,
and what continues the passage,

00:26:23.143 --> 00:26:27.558
shows that even here Satan is
absolutely at his weakest.

00:26:27.558 --> 00:26:31.724
The passage continues [points
to board]: "He walkt with

00:26:31.724 --> 00:26:34.267
to support uneasy
steps…"

00:26:34.267 --> 00:26:37.171
In other words,
he's just risen from the fiery

00:26:37.171 --> 00:26:37.470
lake.
 

00:26:37.470 --> 00:26:39.553
He's as weak as he's ever going
to be right now

00:26:39.553 --> 00:26:40.640
&gt;
 

00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:44.980
and yet he's already a lot more
than you can handle.

00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:50.519
That is the way the syntax of
Paradise Lost educates us

00:26:50.519 --> 00:26:56.151
into realizing that every time
we think we grasp the point of a

00:26:56.151 --> 00:26:59.211
text,
we prove that we are fallen

00:26:59.211 --> 00:27:02.125
readers,
that we have prematurely

00:27:02.125 --> 00:27:06.928
understood what's there,
and that only understanding it

00:27:06.928 --> 00:27:11.608
in the long run can prevail upon
us to realize the fallen

00:27:11.608 --> 00:27:14.705
condition,
which the text is obviously

00:27:14.705 --> 00:27:15.920
after all about.
 

00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:18.420
That was Fish's first opinion.
 

00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:21.335
Not too long after that,
in the course of writing a book

00:27:21.335 --> 00:27:24.196
called Self-Consuming
Artifacts, he began

00:27:24.196 --> 00:27:27.270
to have a different opinion
which more or less reversed the

00:27:27.270 --> 00:27:28.118
first one.
 

00:27:28.118 --> 00:27:31.978
He decided it isn't the text
that brings the reader into

00:27:31.978 --> 00:27:33.355
being--
that is to say,

00:27:33.355 --> 00:27:35.743
brings about the
self-realization on my part that

00:27:35.743 --> 00:27:38.680
I'm a fallen being in the case
of Paradise Lost.

00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:42.480
It isn't the text that brings
the reader into existence.

00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:45.670
It's the reader that brings the
text into existence.

00:27:45.670 --> 00:27:49.048
It's the reader,
after all, who performed this

00:27:49.048 --> 00:27:52.611
act of reading,
and it's the reader who made

00:27:52.611 --> 00:27:56.719
visible in the text the
possibility that this is what

00:27:56.719 --> 00:27:58.220
Milton is doing.
 

00:27:58.220 --> 00:28:02.685
So he reverses his field while
retaining the same structure of

00:28:02.685 --> 00:28:07.224
argument and the same range of
insight about what one can think

00:28:07.224 --> 00:28:08.470
about a text.
 

00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:13.346
Well, that was fine until he
realized that a reader has to

00:28:13.346 --> 00:28:15.230
come from someplace.
 

00:28:15.230 --> 00:28:21.230
A reader isn't just an
autonomous being.

00:28:21.230 --> 00:28:26.160
This is where he realized that
the third step in his

00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:30.153
development,
his second change of mind,

00:28:30.153 --> 00:28:35.730
means this: it's not the text
that produces the reader,

00:28:35.730 --> 00:28:38.980
it's not the reader that
produces the text,

00:28:38.980 --> 00:28:43.953
but it's the community that
produces the reader who in turn

00:28:43.953 --> 00:28:45.670
produces the text.
 

00:28:45.670 --> 00:28:52.430
Those three points in other
words map the progress of his

00:28:52.430 --> 00:28:55.690
thinking on these issues.
 

00:28:55.690 --> 00:28:59.788
Take a quick look at page 1025,
the right-hand column.

00:28:59.788 --> 00:29:04.219
He says, bottom of the
paragraph: "Interpretation

00:29:04.219 --> 00:29:09.150
is not the art of construing but
the art of constructing.

00:29:09.150 --> 00:29:12.220
Interpreters do not decode
poems;

00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:14.088
they make them."
 

00:29:14.088 --> 00:29:18.718
When he says that,
he's only at phase two of his

00:29:18.718 --> 00:29:21.740
thinking,
because there is still the

00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:26.126
possibility open to the reader
of thinking that the interpreter

00:29:26.126 --> 00:29:29.098
is an autonomous being whose
thoughts,

00:29:29.098 --> 00:29:32.671
whose interpretive powers,
and whose strategies of reading

00:29:32.671 --> 00:29:34.990
emanate from something from
within.

00:29:34.990 --> 00:29:39.832
Then on page 1027 he clarifies,
toward the bottom of the

00:29:39.832 --> 00:29:43.529
right-hand column:
"This does not,

00:29:43.529 --> 00:29:46.240
however, commit me to
subjectivity..."

00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:48.913
In other words,
it's not just a question of

00:29:48.913 --> 00:29:51.779
whatever I think is in a text is
in a text.

00:29:51.779 --> 00:29:54.499
I'm the one who makes the text,
and you make the text,

00:29:54.499 --> 00:29:56.450
and the other person makes the
text.

00:29:56.450 --> 00:29:59.480
We all make different texts
because we all have different

00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:01.970
subjectivities--that's not what
he's saying.

00:30:01.970 --> 00:30:04.958
This does not,
however, commit me to

00:30:04.958 --> 00:30:09.739
subjectivity because the means
by which they are made are

00:30:09.739 --> 00:30:12.130
social and conventional.
 

00:30:12.130 --> 00:30:16.607
In other words,
I can't have an off-the-wall

00:30:16.607 --> 00:30:22.650
interpretation of anything if
anyone else ever hears it.

00:30:22.650 --> 00:30:26.019
Yeah, if I'm
&gt;

00:30:26.019 --> 00:30:28.971
just in my room,
surrounded by yellow wallpaper

00:30:28.971 --> 00:30:32.336
or something like that,
I suppose I can have an

00:30:32.336 --> 00:30:35.509
off-the-wall interpretation of
something,

00:30:35.509 --> 00:30:38.279
but if I try to publish it,
forget it.

00:30:38.279 --> 00:30:42.779
When I try to publish,
when I try to express myself,

00:30:42.779 --> 00:30:49.150
when I expose myself to any
aspect of the public sphere,

00:30:49.150 --> 00:30:54.938
my interpretation--if it's to
be judged as an interpretation

00:30:54.938 --> 00:30:57.268
at all,
if it's to count as an

00:30:57.268 --> 00:30:59.868
interpretation,
and if it's to count as an

00:30:59.868 --> 00:31:03.256
opinion--
must already be enmeshed in the

00:31:03.256 --> 00:31:07.750
interpretative community to
which it's addressed.

00:31:07.750 --> 00:31:11.348
It must have some sort of link
with that community.

00:31:11.348 --> 00:31:17.219
It must involve some sort of
membership or relationship with

00:31:17.219 --> 00:31:22.252
that community,
so that what Fish concludes is

00:31:22.252 --> 00:31:27.118
that there are neither subjects
nor objects.

00:31:27.118 --> 00:31:29.948
In other words,
this is Fish's way,

00:31:29.948 --> 00:31:32.942
following Derrida and
deconstruction,

00:31:32.942 --> 00:31:37.269
of attacking the Western
metaphysical tradition.

00:31:37.269 --> 00:31:41.243
As long as we suppose that
understanding is a matter of

00:31:41.243 --> 00:31:45.660
parsing or coming to terms with
subject-object relations,

00:31:45.660 --> 00:31:48.960
we're on the wrong track to
understanding.

00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:53.738
We have to understand the way
in which neither the subject nor

00:31:53.738 --> 00:31:57.890
the object can be said to have a
stable existence,

00:31:57.890 --> 00:32:02.586
to have integrity of any kind,
before we can come closer to

00:32:02.586 --> 00:32:06.557
grasping how it is that
interpretation is made and

00:32:06.557 --> 00:32:07.608
achieved.
 

00:32:07.608 --> 00:32:13.240
We've seen this before all the
way back at the beginning of the

00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:18.419
semester when we talked about
fore-having in Heidegger and

00:32:18.419 --> 00:32:21.476
Gadamer,
about the way in which we

00:32:21.476 --> 00:32:25.604
always see something as
something: we never see it as an

00:32:25.604 --> 00:32:28.361
object,
we never see it in and of

00:32:28.361 --> 00:32:28.980
itself.
 

00:32:28.980 --> 00:32:32.375
We've seen this before,
but there is a slight

00:32:32.375 --> 00:32:37.314
difference because Heidegger and
Gadamer hold out the object as a

00:32:37.314 --> 00:32:42.328
standard against which one's
opinions about it can be tested.

00:32:42.328 --> 00:32:45.501
In other words,
the hermeneutic circle is a

00:32:45.501 --> 00:32:50.184
movement back and forth between
interpretation and what's being

00:32:50.184 --> 00:32:52.878
interpreted,
so that what's being

00:32:52.878 --> 00:32:57.317
interpreted is a constant check
on the process of interpretation

00:32:57.317 --> 00:33:00.770
just as interpretation,
as it deepens,

00:33:00.770 --> 00:33:07.420
is a finer and finer outlining
of the nature of the object.

00:33:07.420 --> 00:33:11.160
So the hermeneutic circle which
resembles,

00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:15.420
which anticipates the thinking
of Fish in that it insists on

00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:18.596
the way in which all
interpretation begins as

00:33:18.596 --> 00:33:22.396
preconception,
nevertheless does also entail

00:33:22.396 --> 00:33:26.750
that subtle difference in that
the object is there.

00:33:26.750 --> 00:33:29.986
It's not that Fish denies the
existence of objects--although

00:33:29.986 --> 00:33:32.618
sometimes his rhetoric makes it
seem that way.

00:33:32.618 --> 00:33:38.958
He simply denies that we can
know them as objects at any

00:33:38.958 --> 00:33:39.880
point.
 

00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:44.743
We bring them into being,
and in bringing them into being

00:33:44.743 --> 00:33:49.607
we construct them in whatever
way it is that we construct

00:33:49.607 --> 00:33:50.390
them.
 

00:33:50.390 --> 00:33:52.319
Okay.
 

00:33:52.319 --> 00:33:53.880
Interpretive community.
 

00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:56.769
What do we make of this idea of
interpretive community?

00:33:56.769 --> 00:34:00.519
I have just said we all belong
to an interpretive community.

00:34:00.519 --> 00:34:03.230
We sitting here all belong to
an interpretive community.

00:34:03.230 --> 00:34:05.910
There may be a couple of
sub-communities here,

00:34:05.910 --> 00:34:08.768
but basically we're an
interpretive community.

00:34:08.768 --> 00:34:13.512
We understand each other,
and yet at the same time it's

00:34:13.512 --> 00:34:16.360
equally the case,
as I'm sure all of you are

00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:20.039
thinking to yourselves,
that no one of us has exactly

00:34:20.039 --> 00:34:23.760
the same set of opinions as
anyone else.

00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:27.289
We say we belong to an
interpretive community.

00:34:27.289 --> 00:34:29.905
We can in fact,
according to a certain weak

00:34:29.905 --> 00:34:32.929
form of the argument,
understand the way in which

00:34:32.929 --> 00:34:35.987
yes, we do bring things into
being according to certain

00:34:35.987 --> 00:34:39.159
habits that have evolved through
our membership in such a

00:34:39.159 --> 00:34:41.762
community;
but at the same time we say,

00:34:41.762 --> 00:34:42.889
"Guess what?
 

00:34:42.889 --> 00:34:46.329
I don't quite interpret
&gt;

00:34:46.329 --> 00:34:50.699
Jacobs, Rosenbaum and the rest
of them in the way Fish's class

00:34:50.699 --> 00:34:51.130
did.
 

00:34:51.130 --> 00:34:53.987
I still don't interpret it in
the way that Professor Fry

00:34:53.987 --> 00:34:55.860
supplemented their
interpretation.

00:34:55.860 --> 00:34:59.313
I interpret it a little
differently, and furthermore I

00:34:59.313 --> 00:35:01.530
knew all along it wasn't a poem.
 

00:35:01.530 --> 00:35:08.210
You can't fool me,"
and so on.

00:35:08.210 --> 00:35:10.690
Each of us says to ourselves,
"Okay.

00:35:10.690 --> 00:35:13.740
Yeah, we have certain things in
common, but there are also ways

00:35:13.740 --> 00:35:15.070
in which we differ."
 

00:35:15.070 --> 00:35:17.869
What would Fish say to that?
 

00:35:17.869 --> 00:35:23.135
I think what he would say is
this, and I do think this needs

00:35:23.135 --> 00:35:27.239
to be acknowledged:
it weakens his position.

00:35:27.239 --> 00:35:31.724
He would say, "All right,
granted: in a rough sense,

00:35:31.724 --> 00:35:35.536
we belong here--
just as John Guillory says in a

00:35:35.536 --> 00:35:37.880
rough sense we're all in a
school--

00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:42.320
we belong to an interpretive
community;

00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:46.865
but there's another sense in
which we are each of us the sum

00:35:46.865 --> 00:35:48.824
total,
the composite,

00:35:48.824 --> 00:35:53.617
of all the interpretive
communities to which we now in

00:35:53.617 --> 00:35:58.679
some way or another have an
affinity and from which,

00:35:58.679 --> 00:36:01.300
in all the variety of ways one
can mention,

00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:02.768
we have emerged.
 

00:36:02.768 --> 00:36:05.710
Yes, we're each different
because the sum of the

00:36:05.710 --> 00:36:08.650
interpretive communities to
which we belong,

00:36:08.650 --> 00:36:12.320
constituting the ultimate
interpretive community that

00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:15.586
indeed we are,
is always going to be a little

00:36:15.586 --> 00:36:19.378
different from the sum of the
communities to which other

00:36:19.378 --> 00:36:20.550
people belong.
 

00:36:20.550 --> 00:36:24.434
This reduces the idea of
interpretive community to a kind

00:36:24.434 --> 00:36:27.554
of atomism whereby we all
concede and all say,

00:36:27.554 --> 00:36:29.289
"Yes, it's true.
 

00:36:29.289 --> 00:36:32.389
I am in a certain sense a
community."

00:36:32.389 --> 00:36:36.070
That's all Bakhtin said:
"I am a community.

00:36:36.070 --> 00:36:38.585
I am a community and,
of course, what communities do

00:36:38.585 --> 00:36:40.409
when they think is
interpret."

00:36:40.409 --> 00:36:42.329
Thinking is interpretation.
 

00:36:42.329 --> 00:36:45.568
But at the same time
"What's the point,"

00:36:45.568 --> 00:36:47.980
we then say,
"of saying I'm a community

00:36:47.980 --> 00:36:49.409
if,
in fact I'm a little different

00:36:49.409 --> 00:36:50.489
from everybody else?"
 

00:36:50.489 --> 00:36:54.030
Why not retain a certain sense
of subjectivity,

00:36:54.030 --> 00:36:59.373
or why not at least retain that
sense of individuality which

00:36:59.373 --> 00:37:04.900
results from the fact that none
of us ultimately or completely

00:37:04.900 --> 00:37:09.340
on every particular agree with
anybody else--

00:37:09.340 --> 00:37:12.894
the reason being that the sum
of our interpretative

00:37:12.894 --> 00:37:17.161
communities that makes up that
fundamental community to which

00:37:17.161 --> 00:37:21.429
we say we belong is always a
little bit different?"

00:37:21.429 --> 00:37:26.157
Now there is another argument
against this position which

00:37:26.157 --> 00:37:29.619
might be called radical
constructivism.

00:37:29.619 --> 00:37:35.123
We hear very frequently from
sociobiological thinkers like

00:37:35.123 --> 00:37:35.992
Edward O.
 

00:37:35.992 --> 00:37:39.661
Wilson, for example,
who point out that

00:37:39.661 --> 00:37:45.648
consciousness is hard wired to
do and to recognize all sorts of

00:37:45.648 --> 00:37:47.000
things.
 

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:52.510
It has been shown in the lab
that aesthetic preference,

00:37:52.510 --> 00:37:56.400
which of course was always held
up to derision as anything like

00:37:56.400 --> 00:38:00.237
an objective standard--
"There is no disputing

00:38:00.237 --> 00:38:02.760
tastes,"
we always say--

00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:06.070
but even aesthetic preference,
it's been shown in the lab,

00:38:06.070 --> 00:38:09.809
involves certain predilections
we all do have in common.

00:38:09.809 --> 00:38:13.081
We all prefer the so-called
golden section,

00:38:13.081 --> 00:38:16.507
we love arches,
and this can explained in all

00:38:16.507 --> 00:38:17.909
sorts of ways.
 

00:38:17.909 --> 00:38:20.963
The most common explanation has
to do with what's called shelter

00:38:20.963 --> 00:38:21.400
theory.
 

00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:24.300
We like shapes that somehow or
another offer shelter or

00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:25.000
protection.
 

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:28.340
In any case,
the fairly conclusive evidence

00:38:28.340 --> 00:38:33.034
is that in a variety of ways,
we are hard wired to recognize

00:38:33.034 --> 00:38:33.909
things.
 

00:38:33.909 --> 00:38:38.373
Darwin's last book is all about
how we recognize each other's

00:38:38.373 --> 00:38:41.391
expressions,
we recognize the expressions of

00:38:41.391 --> 00:38:44.579
animals with which we have a
great deal in common,

00:38:44.579 --> 00:38:48.139
and that we do this from
infancy--in other words,

00:38:48.139 --> 00:38:51.329
all sorts of evidence to this
effect.

00:38:51.329 --> 00:38:55.012
I'm not sure Fish's argument is
vulnerable to that position

00:38:55.012 --> 00:38:58.250
because, after all,
hard wiring is communitarian.

00:38:58.250 --> 00:38:59.260
&gt;
 

00:38:59.260 --> 00:39:02.545
The point is precisely that we
all have it and that it's not

00:39:02.545 --> 00:39:04.829
something that we can call
individual,

00:39:04.829 --> 00:39:09.896
not something that we can call
autonomous to any one of us as

00:39:09.896 --> 00:39:11.079
individuals.
 

00:39:11.079 --> 00:39:16.012
So it seems to me that although
the argument against so-called

00:39:16.012 --> 00:39:20.380
radical constructivism usually
does take this form,

00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:22.400
it actually is not a very good
argument,

00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:27.320
and that the argument objecting
to the mere weakness of the way

00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:32.242
in which interpretive community
as a concept ultimately becomes

00:39:32.242 --> 00:39:35.179
atomistic is a stronger
argument;

00:39:35.179 --> 00:39:41.239
because what does it matter if
I'm an interpretive community if

00:39:41.239 --> 00:39:44.268
I'm still a community of one?
 

00:39:44.268 --> 00:39:47.798
In some measure,
it's something that seems less

00:39:47.798 --> 00:39:52.018
worth talking about once one's
put it in those terms.

00:39:52.018 --> 00:39:57.820
Very quickly then on Guillory
whose argument actually ended

00:39:57.820 --> 00:40:03.719
the very debate that he thinks
is going to intensify and get

00:40:03.719 --> 00:40:04.719
worse.
 

00:40:04.719 --> 00:40:07.909
In other words,
he thought that the big,

00:40:07.909 --> 00:40:12.681
hot-button topic in the
academic world for the next

00:40:12.681 --> 00:40:17.358
twenty-five years or more would
be the canon wars:

00:40:17.358 --> 00:40:19.644
canonical,
non-canonical,

00:40:19.644 --> 00:40:23.389
cultural, and multicultural--
he thought this would be the

00:40:23.389 --> 00:40:27.139
fundamental point of contention
in the academic world.

00:40:27.139 --> 00:40:29.548
Well, it wasn't,
and the reason it wasn't is

00:40:29.548 --> 00:40:32.405
that his argument was so
brilliant everybody came to

00:40:32.405 --> 00:40:35.320
their senses and realized
&gt;

00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:38.429
that they were barking up the
wrong tree, literally.

00:40:38.429 --> 00:40:41.793
His book, Cultural Capital,
simply silenced not the

00:40:41.793 --> 00:40:44.626
public, because nothing ever
silences the public,

00:40:44.626 --> 00:40:46.280
&gt;
 

00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:53.273
but simply silenced the debate
about the culture wars in the

00:40:53.273 --> 00:40:54.460
academy.
 

00:40:54.460 --> 00:40:59.992
In some ways Guillory amusingly
undermines his own prophecy,

00:40:59.992 --> 00:41:05.150
which by the way is on page
1477 in the upper right-hand

00:41:05.150 --> 00:41:08.340
column if you care to read it.
 

00:41:08.340 --> 00:41:13.280
Now Guillory's main
preoccupation--

00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:17.380
which he takes largely from
Pierre Bourdieu but also,

00:41:17.380 --> 00:41:20.389
as he argues in a long
constructive digression,

00:41:20.389 --> 00:41:25.501
from Antonio Gramsci--his main
preoccupation is with the school

00:41:25.501 --> 00:41:30.121
as a means of establishing and
proliferating what Gramsci

00:41:30.121 --> 00:41:32.760
called "hegemony."
 

00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:37.668
The school, in other words,
on this argument doesn't

00:41:37.668 --> 00:41:40.639
typically--
and we'll come back to the

00:41:40.639 --> 00:41:43.550
exception that Guillory himself
does make--

00:41:43.550 --> 00:41:50.324
doesn't typically send out into
the world minds armed with

00:41:50.324 --> 00:41:56.030
specific bodies of knowledge or
understanding.

00:41:56.030 --> 00:41:59.179
It sends out into the world,
especially when it's a question

00:41:59.179 --> 00:42:01.768
of the humanities--
which Guillory thinks are

00:42:01.768 --> 00:42:05.179
painting themselves into the
corner in their obtuseness--

00:42:05.179 --> 00:42:11.054
the school sends out into the
world people endowed with a

00:42:11.054 --> 00:42:15.039
certain quantum of cultural
capital.

00:42:15.039 --> 00:42:18.224
It repeats, in other words--in
Bourdieu's term it

00:42:18.224 --> 00:42:22.103
"reproduces"--
a structure of class,

00:42:22.103 --> 00:42:27.646
but really class in the sort of
super-structural sense:

00:42:27.646 --> 00:42:32.570
class superiority that
regardless of the specific

00:42:32.570 --> 00:42:39.550
content that a person supposes
himself to have been mastering,

00:42:39.550 --> 00:42:45.021
simply replicates an
orientation to the ruling class

00:42:45.021 --> 00:42:49.099
that the school in Western
culture,

00:42:49.099 --> 00:42:51.320
according to Guillory,
has always had.

00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:57.300
What the school reproduces is
not knowledge so much as itself,

00:42:57.300 --> 00:43:01.719
the attitude that it embodies,
its reason for being,

00:43:01.719 --> 00:43:07.670
its reason for continuation,
and its relation to power and

00:43:07.670 --> 00:43:09.550
state apparatus.
 

00:43:09.550 --> 00:43:15.099
That's Guillory's basic
position and it's why he says

00:43:15.099 --> 00:43:20.864
that the culture wars simply
play into the hands of the

00:43:20.864 --> 00:43:24.920
monolithic ideology of the
school.

00:43:24.920 --> 00:43:29.250
What happens when you embrace
multiculturalism as the only

00:43:29.250 --> 00:43:33.579
means of inculcating what
Guillory calls "progressive

00:43:33.579 --> 00:43:36.748
pedagogy"--
what happens when you embrace

00:43:36.748 --> 00:43:39.548
multiculturalism,
according to Guillory,

00:43:39.548 --> 00:43:43.925
is that you deracinate the
objects of your intention from

00:43:43.925 --> 00:43:48.693
the culture to which they belong
in precisely the way that the

00:43:48.693 --> 00:43:52.914
great monuments of Western
civilization have long since

00:43:52.914 --> 00:43:56.822
been deracinated from their
historical and cultural

00:43:56.822 --> 00:43:58.619
circumstances.
 

00:43:58.619 --> 00:44:07.251
You reduce both Western Civ and
alternative canons to the same

00:44:07.251 --> 00:44:15.599
deracinated, rootless sort of
nature as cultural capital.

00:44:15.599 --> 00:44:17.809
"I have read this.
 

00:44:17.809 --> 00:44:23.298
I have a certain status and
negotiability in the world as

00:44:23.298 --> 00:44:25.750
having read this."
 

00:44:25.750 --> 00:44:29.538
In the case of Western Civ,
it's quotations from the poets

00:44:29.538 --> 00:44:31.400
and after-dinner speeches.
 

00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:34.179
In the case of multicultural
curricula,

00:44:34.179 --> 00:44:38.423
it's the opportunity to allude
in precisely the same way on

00:44:38.423 --> 00:44:42.146
largely the same occasions,
and in either case it has

00:44:42.146 --> 00:44:44.530
nothing to do with learning
anything,

00:44:44.530 --> 00:44:49.010
according to Guillory,
about the historical and social

00:44:49.010 --> 00:44:53.829
circumstances in which any kind
of cultural production are

00:44:53.829 --> 00:44:54.929
grounded.
 

00:44:54.929 --> 00:45:01.119
Now the argument depends,
of course,

00:45:01.119 --> 00:45:07.349
on supposing that the way in
which the great works are taught

00:45:07.349 --> 00:45:13.059
is as though they embody certain
ideas of principles.

00:45:13.059 --> 00:45:16.190
That is to say,
they're taught as messages,

00:45:16.190 --> 00:45:19.619
in Guillory's view,
whatever form of message it

00:45:19.619 --> 00:45:20.590
might be.
 

00:45:20.590 --> 00:45:25.365
The Western canon has a message
about the importance of being an

00:45:25.365 --> 00:45:26.199
American.
 

00:45:26.199 --> 00:45:31.989
The multicultural canon has a
contestatory message about the

00:45:31.989 --> 00:45:37.289
importance of being whoever
happens to be speaking,

00:45:37.289 --> 00:45:40.429
but in each case they're merely
messages.

00:45:40.429 --> 00:45:42.400
They're not cultural artifacts.
 

00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:47.561
They don't emerge from the real
sort of historical and living

00:45:47.561 --> 00:45:51.260
circumstances in which they are
written,

00:45:51.260 --> 00:45:55.190
which of course is,
most broadly speaking,

00:45:55.190 --> 00:45:59.260
simply an appeal to method,
a new way of teaching.

00:45:59.260 --> 00:46:02.090
Guillory's own deepest
commitment is,

00:46:02.090 --> 00:46:04.449
in fact, to the great works.
 

00:46:04.449 --> 00:46:06.969
Guillory began as an early
modern scholar.

00:46:06.969 --> 00:46:10.032
He wrote a very,
very fine first book on Spenser

00:46:10.032 --> 00:46:10.880
and Milton.
 

00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:15.905
His later work in literary
sociology in no ways discredits

00:46:15.905 --> 00:46:20.753
or undermines the fact that
earlier in his career he was

00:46:20.753 --> 00:46:23.840
interested in a cultural canon.
 

00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:27.487
In fact, probably the most
interesting chapter in

00:46:27.487 --> 00:46:31.516
Cultural Capital is maybe
not this introductory

00:46:31.516 --> 00:46:36.000
theoretical one but an amazing
chapter in which he shows how

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:40.103
Thomas Gray's "Elegy in a
Country Churchyard"

00:46:40.103 --> 00:46:44.512
came to predominate in English
curricula even though it was

00:46:44.512 --> 00:46:48.159
written in the vernacular,
in English.

00:46:48.159 --> 00:46:51.215
He shows in other words how
"Elegy in a Country

00:46:51.215 --> 00:46:54.092
Churchyard,"
in the way in which it situated

00:46:54.092 --> 00:46:59.050
itself in culture at that time,
actually undermined the premium

00:46:59.050 --> 00:47:02.681
place on the classics,
on Latinity,

00:47:02.681 --> 00:47:10.230
and helped the emergence of a
vernacular national curriculum.

00:47:10.230 --> 00:47:13.675
It's an absolutely brilliant
argument in which "Elegy in

00:47:13.675 --> 00:47:16.548
a Country Churchyard"
is itself constantly and

00:47:16.548 --> 00:47:18.789
steadily and fascinatingly
invoked.

00:47:18.789 --> 00:47:22.219
In other words,
Guillory himself likes the

00:47:22.219 --> 00:47:23.139
classics.
 

00:47:23.139 --> 00:47:26.824
Perhaps the most interesting
part of this argument is the way

00:47:26.824 --> 00:47:30.510
in which the Western Civ mavens
are simply fooled about their

00:47:30.510 --> 00:47:34.320
own understanding of what a
canon is because perpetually,

00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:35.980
history changes canons.
 

00:47:35.980 --> 00:47:38.643
The more books you get,
the fewer you can read,

00:47:38.643 --> 00:47:41.364
and the more gets dropped out
of any curriculum,

00:47:41.364 --> 00:47:43.739
including the Western Civ
curriculum.

00:47:43.739 --> 00:47:48.920
Today we're proud if we're
proponents of great books.

00:47:48.920 --> 00:47:51.289
We're proud of reading Plato
and Aristotle.

00:47:51.289 --> 00:47:54.108
In the old days,
people didn't stop with Plato

00:47:54.108 --> 00:47:55.110
and Aristotle.
 

00:47:55.110 --> 00:47:58.128
They read everything there was
to read in Greek and Latin

00:47:58.128 --> 00:48:01.202
culture and then they read such
few books as may have been

00:48:01.202 --> 00:48:02.550
published in English.
 

00:48:02.550 --> 00:48:07.472
Well, a great deal has happened
since then, and perforce modern

00:48:07.472 --> 00:48:12.315
languages and literatures have
altered the canon always to the

00:48:12.315 --> 00:48:14.460
end of thinning it out.
 

00:48:14.460 --> 00:48:17.150
More and more gets left out.
 

00:48:17.150 --> 00:48:20.173
This is an inevitability even
in the so-called

00:48:20.173 --> 00:48:23.534
"canonical"
and therefore itself needs to

00:48:23.534 --> 00:48:27.030
acknowledge the centrality of
historical change.

00:48:27.030 --> 00:48:30.239
Guillory's argument obviously
hinges on the failure of anybody

00:48:30.239 --> 00:48:33.134
involved in these debates to
distinguish between the two

00:48:33.134 --> 00:48:34.029
forms of culture.
 

00:48:34.029 --> 00:48:35.449
&gt;
 

00:48:35.449 --> 00:48:38.769
There is culture,
the kind of culture on which a

00:48:38.769 --> 00:48:42.021
person without any education at
all and the new

00:48:42.021 --> 00:48:45.130
professional/managerial class
can meet,

00:48:45.130 --> 00:48:48.385
the kind of culture in which
precisely literature doesn't

00:48:48.385 --> 00:48:48.909
matter.
 

00:48:48.909 --> 00:48:49.940
Who needs literature?
 

00:48:49.940 --> 00:48:52.119
"I'm running
Hewlett-Packard.

00:48:52.119 --> 00:48:54.320
Do I need literature?"
 

00:48:54.320 --> 00:48:58.369
At the same time,
there is the kind of culture

00:48:58.369 --> 00:49:03.101
with a capital K,
as we say, which is all about

00:49:03.101 --> 00:49:05.572
the great books,
high culture,

00:49:05.572 --> 00:49:08.940
the monuments of civilization,
and so on.

00:49:08.940 --> 00:49:12.813
Guillory says the total
disconnect in the way in which

00:49:12.813 --> 00:49:16.688
we understand the relations
between these two forms of

00:49:16.688 --> 00:49:20.489
culture is what leads to the
kinds of deracination in

00:49:20.489 --> 00:49:23.340
teaching that he complains
about.

00:49:23.340 --> 00:49:28.036
He himself finally thinks that
anything is fair game to be

00:49:28.036 --> 00:49:30.083
taught,
and it can be taught

00:49:30.083 --> 00:49:33.692
progressively as long as it is
taught in terms of its social

00:49:33.692 --> 00:49:35.650
and historical circumstances.
 

00:49:35.650 --> 00:49:40.739
He points out that a great
book--I will quote this and then

00:49:40.739 --> 00:49:44.317
I'll leave you--
is great in part because it

00:49:44.317 --> 00:49:48.978
can't possibly be reduced to the
silliness that the advocates of

00:49:48.978 --> 00:49:51.050
Western Civ attach to it.
 

00:49:51.050 --> 00:49:53.530
He says, page 1482,
right-hand column:

00:49:53.530 --> 00:49:57.737
No cultural work of any
interest at all is simple enough

00:49:57.737 --> 00:50:00.949
to be credibly allegorized in
this way,

00:50:00.949 --> 00:50:05.293
because any cultural work will
objectify in its very

00:50:05.293 --> 00:50:10.010
form and content the same social
conflicts that the canon debate

00:50:10.010 --> 00:50:13.679
allegorizes by means of a
divided curriculum.

00:50:13.679 --> 00:50:18.215
The Odyssey is full of
lying, trickery,

00:50:18.215 --> 00:50:19.929
class betrayal.
 

00:50:19.929 --> 00:50:21.842
In The Iliad,
perhaps the most

00:50:21.842 --> 00:50:25.231
interesting character,
as I'm sure you'll all agree,

00:50:25.231 --> 00:50:29.570
is Thersites who is scarcely an
advocate of the values that we

00:50:29.570 --> 00:50:31.989
associate with Western culture.
 

00:50:31.989 --> 00:50:35.077
In any case,
this is what Guillory means by

00:50:35.077 --> 00:50:38.902
saying that you cannot
monumentalize anything in this

00:50:38.902 --> 00:50:43.018
way if you read it carefully and
attentively enough.

00:50:43.018 --> 00:50:46.139
So ultimately it's simply a
program for reading.

00:50:46.139 --> 00:50:47.039
Okay.
 

00:50:47.039 --> 00:50:50.708
Next time we'll talk about the
idea that we shouldn't have

00:50:50.708 --> 00:50:51.739
theory at all.

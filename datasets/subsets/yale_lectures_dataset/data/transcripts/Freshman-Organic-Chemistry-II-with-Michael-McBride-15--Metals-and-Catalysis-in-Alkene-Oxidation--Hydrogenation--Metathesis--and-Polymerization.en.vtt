00:00:02.467 --> 00:00:04.433
J. MICHAEL MCBRIDE: OK, we're
still talking about 

00:00:04.433 --> 00:00:07.633
addition to alkenes. 

00:00:07.633 --> 00:00:11.733
And we've looked at these
various electrophile cum 

00:00:11.733 --> 00:00:14.667
nucleophiles adding to alkenes.

00:00:14.667 --> 00:00:18.233
And now, at the beginning last
time, we introduced the idea 

00:00:18.233 --> 00:00:21.733
of osmium tetroxide and we'll go
on to permanganate as 

00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:25.467
reagents for dihydroxylation of
alkenes. 

00:00:25.467 --> 00:00:28.833
Then we'll go onto things
involving transition metals, 

00:00:28.833 --> 00:00:34.233
catalytic hydrogenation, and
also metathesis and catalyzed 

00:00:34.233 --> 00:00:36.867
polymerization. 

00:00:36.867 --> 00:00:39.967
So last time, we looked at the
end at OsO4, which looked a 

00:00:39.967 --> 00:00:44.667
little bit like O3 and could do
the same trick O3 could do, 

00:00:44.667 --> 00:00:49.067
to give this osmate ester, which
is like an acetal. 

00:00:49.067 --> 00:00:54.500
So it's possible to add water
and get the osmium equivalent 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.367
of a carbonyl group, and the two
hydroxyl groups added to 

00:00:58.367 --> 00:01:00.833
the termini of the alkene. 

00:01:00.833 --> 00:01:07.000
So the problem with this is OsO4
is a very efficient 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.733
reagent for that, but it's
poisonous, and 

00:01:09.733 --> 00:01:11.700
it's also very expensive. 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.533
So you have to figure out some
way not to use so much of it. 

00:01:15.533 --> 00:01:18.700
And the way you could do it is
to use just a little bit of it 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.633
as a catalyst, and put hydrogen
peroxide in there, in 

00:01:23.633 --> 00:01:27.400
order to convert the osmium
equivalent of trioxide back to 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.567
the tetroxide again, so it can
cycle around and keep doing 

00:01:31.567 --> 00:01:33.067
the reaction. 

00:01:33.067 --> 00:01:38.267
In fact, it was improved in
1976, by using a different 

00:01:38.267 --> 00:01:46.400
oxidizing agent, this N-oxide,
the morpholine oxide. 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.067
And in fact, this is called the
Upjohn process, which is 

00:01:49.067 --> 00:01:51.867
relevant because the guy whose
picture is over here, whose 

00:01:51.867 --> 00:01:55.033
estate gave the money for
redoing this room awhile back, 

00:01:55.033 --> 00:01:59.833
was the research director at
Upjohn Laboratories. 

00:01:59.833 --> 00:02:01.400
So anyhow, that was a good way
to do it. 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.000
But then, we should notice
something about the 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.400
stereochemistry of this. 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.100
We showed here a trans-2-butene.

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.000
And of course, if it's like
ozone, the two oxygens will 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.500
add at the same time, therefore
to the same face. 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.000
So the configuration you get at
the two carbons, where the 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.100
OH's add, are related to one
another. 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.767
They could be S, S, as shown
here. 

00:02:25.767 --> 00:02:28.333
Of course, the osmium tetroxide
could equally well 

00:02:28.333 --> 00:02:32.967
have come in from the bottom, or
the 2-butene could have 

00:02:32.967 --> 00:02:36.500
been turned over, and then you
would have gotten R, R. So of 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.533
course you don't get chirality
without 

00:02:38.533 --> 00:02:40.333
starting with chirality. 

00:02:40.333 --> 00:02:42.900
That is, a single chirality. 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.000
However, you can start with it
in a ligand that attaches to 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
the to the osmium. 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.533
So if you use a chiral amine
ligand, then, you only get one 

00:02:53.533 --> 00:03:01.533
of the two enantiomers of the
dihydroxylated alkene. 

00:03:01.533 --> 00:03:03.667
And this, you won't be surprised
to hear, was also 

00:03:03.667 --> 00:03:06.600
invented by Professor Sharpless,
whom we talked about 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.933
last semester with respect to
adding oxygen. 

00:03:10.933 --> 00:03:13.300
And so this is called the
Sharpless asymmetric 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:14.500
dihydroxylation. 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.300
He invented it in 1988, and I
think this room was the first 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.300
place he talked about it in
public. 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.300
He was standing right there, and
in fact, he did a 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:27.433
demonstration on this table, as
I'm going to do in the end. 

00:03:27.433 --> 00:03:31.467
But I'm going to do a different
demonstration. 

00:03:31.467 --> 00:03:33.900
Because osmium tetroxide which
he used, is very 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.400
dangerous and poisonous. 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.233
And he actually spilled it on
this table. 

00:03:38.233 --> 00:03:41.567
I think it's now long gone,
since that was 1988. 

00:03:41.567 --> 00:03:44.333
But at least what I'm going to
do just uses vinegar, so you 

00:03:44.333 --> 00:03:46.900
don't have to worry about that.

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.433
OK, so anyhow, here's a specific
example of using 

00:03:50.433 --> 00:03:52.967
Sharpless asymmetric
dihydroxylation with that 

00:03:52.967 --> 00:03:57.933
diene. It gives a 97% enantiomer
excess of the 

00:03:57.933 --> 00:04:01.900
indicated configuration here. 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.800
Now, the permanganate is much
cheaper, and looks very much 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.067
like osmium tetroxide, so it
won't surprise you that it 

00:04:10.067 --> 00:04:12.433
also can do this trick. 

00:04:12.433 --> 00:04:17.100
And here, you get 85% yield with
cyclohexene. 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.567
And again, it's a syn addition,
the two OH's come in 

00:04:20.567 --> 00:04:22.100
on the same face. 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.733
But that's not one where there's
a catalyst that'll 

00:04:24.733 --> 00:04:25.967
make it give only one
enantiomer. 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:31.700
Now on to catalytic
hydrogenation. 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:35.833
So we looked before at the idea
of drawing two curved 

00:04:35.833 --> 00:04:38.733
arrows and making H2 add to an
alkene. 

00:04:38.733 --> 00:04:41.200
And saw that the orbitals
weren't set up for that. 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.700
HOMO wouldn't match HOMO, LUMO
with LUMO, so there's no 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:46.167
profit in that. 

00:04:46.167 --> 00:04:50.433
However, we said, even though
that doesn't work, that it 

00:04:50.433 --> 00:04:53.800
does work if you have a metal
catalyst, like palladium or 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.233
platinum, or many other
transition metals. 

00:04:57.233 --> 00:05:00.167
So let's look a little bit at
how it is that palladium does 

00:05:00.167 --> 00:05:01.467
this trick. 

00:05:01.467 --> 00:05:04.800
It does it by providing orbital
variety. 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.133
Rather than just having the
orbitals that we showed 

00:05:07.133 --> 00:05:11.400
before, the sigma and sigma-star
of the H-H bond, 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.567
and the pi and pi-star of the
alkene, you have lots of 

00:05:14.567 --> 00:05:16.833
different shapes of orbitals on
the metal. 

00:05:16.833 --> 00:05:22.867
For example, in ethylene, we
have the pi, and the pi-star, 

00:05:22.867 --> 00:05:29.433
but in the metal, palladium has
4d10, 5s0, and 5p0. 

00:05:29.433 --> 00:05:33.067
So the occupied orbitals of
palladium, 

00:05:33.067 --> 00:05:35.600
then, are this dz squared. 

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.967
Now, is that set up to overlap
well with pi-star? 

00:05:38.967 --> 00:05:42.867
The HOMO below and the LUMO
above? 

00:05:42.867 --> 00:05:46.733
What do you think, is that going
to be a good reaction? 

00:05:46.733 --> 00:05:49.433
Who's got an opinion, Karl? 

00:05:49.433 --> 00:05:53.433
STUDENT: I don't think so
because how you have the red 

00:05:53.433 --> 00:05:56.833
on one side of the blue and on
the other side of the blue you 

00:05:56.833 --> 00:06:00.700
might be able to get one side of
the red to overlap? 

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:03.667
PROFESSOR: Maybe on one side,
but not as shown there. 

00:06:03.667 --> 00:06:04.000
Right? 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.033
That's what you're saying there?

00:06:05.033 --> 00:06:08.000
And you're right, they're
orthogonal as drawn. 

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.733
But there are other d orbitals.

00:06:09.733 --> 00:06:12.100
There are five of these d
orbitals, so we could check 

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:13.100
out others. 

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:15.733
How about the dyz, is that going
to do the trick? 

00:06:15.733 --> 00:06:19.600
Are you going to get overlap if
you bring that up? 

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:20.900
Kate, what do you say? 

00:06:24.167 --> 00:06:25.933
If you turned it, you
could...

00:06:25.933 --> 00:06:26.000
STUDENT: Yes.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.333
PROFESSOR: but as shown, it's
orthogonal.

00:06:28.333 --> 00:06:29.600
Right? 

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:32.433
OK, how about that one? 

00:06:32.433 --> 00:06:34.400
Is that going to do the trick? 

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:34.700
No? 

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:35.900
Chris is shaking his head. 

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:36.500
That won't do it. 

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:39.233
How about that one? 

00:06:39.233 --> 00:06:39.567
No? 

00:06:39.567 --> 00:06:42.167
It's still that one of them is
symmetrical right to left, the 

00:06:42.167 --> 00:06:44.333
other is antisymmetric right to
left, so 

00:06:44.333 --> 00:06:45.800
they'd have no overlap. 

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.567
How about that one? 

00:06:47.567 --> 00:06:49.733
Ah, just right. 

00:06:49.733 --> 00:06:53.333
OK, so that one can come up and
overlap, and stabilize the 

00:06:53.333 --> 00:06:55.333
electrons that were on the
metal. 

00:06:55.333 --> 00:06:57.667
And that new orbital shown there
is, in 

00:06:57.667 --> 00:06:59.200
fact, the HOMO-4. 

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:01.700
It's gotten quite stable, right?

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:04.267
In fact, part of the reason it
got stable is the nature of 

00:07:04.267 --> 00:07:06.967
the orbitals changes as atoms
come up, and 

00:07:06.967 --> 00:07:08.767
the geometry changes. 

00:07:08.767 --> 00:07:12.533
So although it looks very much
like those two original 

00:07:12.533 --> 00:07:16.100
orbitals, and in a sense, came
from them, by the time it gets 

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:21.400
to this point at the complex,
it's 40% of that dxy orbital 

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:22.567
on the bottom. 

00:07:22.567 --> 00:07:27.867
47%, actually, on the top is
sigma C-H's, but 13% is still 

00:07:27.867 --> 00:07:28.667
the pi-star. 

00:07:28.667 --> 00:07:32.200
So that's just to tell you the
ugly truth. 

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:35.133
But the fact is that the
reaction began, and went 

00:07:35.133 --> 00:07:36.700
through a transition state
because of the 

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:38.100
mixing of those orbitals. 

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:39.867
So that's two electrons. 

00:07:39.867 --> 00:07:41.600
But how about the other way
around? 

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:43.900
How about if we use the HOMO on
the top? 

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:46.267
Now, of course, we have all
these d orbitals on the 

00:07:46.267 --> 00:07:50.700
bottom, and few of them would
overlap, and even that one 

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:53.533
which does overlap you don't
care about, because 

00:07:53.533 --> 00:07:56.367
it's HOMO with HOMO. 

00:07:56.367 --> 00:07:59.367
We want unoccupied orbitals on
the bottom, which 

00:07:59.367 --> 00:08:02.067
means that 5s and 5p. 

00:08:02.067 --> 00:08:03.867
So there's the 5p. 

00:08:03.867 --> 00:08:06.967
That's an unoccupied orbital,
that's going to overlap well, 

00:08:06.967 --> 00:08:08.267
and there's the 5s. 

00:08:08.267 --> 00:08:09.567
It'll overlap. 

00:08:09.567 --> 00:08:11.500
So you use some mixture of those
two. 

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:12.833
You'll use a hybrid orbital. 

00:08:12.833 --> 00:08:15.500
An sp hybrid of some sort on the
palladium, which will 

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:18.767
overlap with that HOMO and
stabilize another pair of 

00:08:18.767 --> 00:08:19.467
electrons. 

00:08:19.467 --> 00:08:21.067
And there it is in the complex.

00:08:21.067 --> 00:08:24.133
You see, it's a hybrid orbital
below, and the pi orbital 

00:08:24.133 --> 00:08:28.567
above, forming that new bond,
stabilizing those electrons. 

00:08:28.567 --> 00:08:31.867
In fact, if you look at the ugly
truth on this one, by the 

00:08:31.867 --> 00:08:33.767
time you get to the complex,
it's changed. 

00:08:33.767 --> 00:08:40.933
It's 67% of pi, and it's 11% of
an sp hybrid. 

00:08:40.933 --> 00:08:44.600
But it's also 15% of that d
orbital that we showed at the 

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:46.667
beginning, so things have gotten
mixed up. 

00:08:46.667 --> 00:08:48.500
But that's the way it happened,
because you had 

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:51.467
these vacant orbitals that could
overlap from below on 

00:08:51.467 --> 00:08:54.967
the metal, overlap with pi, you
had the filled orbital, 

00:08:54.967 --> 00:08:57.733
the particular one, the orbital
that could overlap 

00:08:57.733 --> 00:08:58.733
with pi-star. 

00:08:58.733 --> 00:09:01.733
So you stabilize two pairs of
electrons. 

00:09:01.733 --> 00:09:05.233
That means you make two new
bonds to the alkene. 

00:09:07.733 --> 00:09:11.367
So the palladium, or platinum,
or many of these transition 

00:09:11.367 --> 00:09:15.633
metals can do this trick of
adding two at the same time to 

00:09:15.633 --> 00:09:17.900
the alkene. 

00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:21.200
Now you can also do it to sigma
bonds. 

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:23.933
So here's palladium reacting
with H2. 

00:09:23.933 --> 00:09:27.133
It's just sigma and sigma-star
now. 

00:09:27.133 --> 00:09:29.400
But if that's the energy of the
starting material in a 

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:33.867
pretty crummy calculation, so
don't hang your hat on this, 

00:09:33.867 --> 00:09:37.233
these are successive stages as
you go left to right. 

00:09:37.233 --> 00:09:41.433
First, you begin to associate
the H2 with the palladium, and 

00:09:41.433 --> 00:09:42.500
bond to it. 

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:45.700
Then the H2 gets even closer,
and as it gets closer and 

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:48.400
closer, the hydrogens spread
apart. 

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:51.000
And the reason I've drawn them
up and down a little bit is to 

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.800
show energy minima and
transition states. 

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:59.700
So first, you get the H2
associated with palladium, 

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:02.067
without very close contact. 

00:10:02.067 --> 00:10:05.467
Then it gets closer, and goes
over a transition state, and 

00:10:05.467 --> 00:10:08.133
becomes this one, which is
closer bonded. 

00:10:08.133 --> 00:10:12.033
And then, the two hydrogens come
apart, and 

00:10:12.033 --> 00:10:13.900
get quite far apart. 

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:16.500
But notice, at least in this
calculation, and in some 

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:19.467
others, as you'll see, it goes
up hill a little bit. 

00:10:19.467 --> 00:10:21.133
So that would seem to be
unfavorable. 

00:10:21.133 --> 00:10:23.433
You could do it, you could split
the hydrogen apart on 

00:10:23.433 --> 00:10:27.533
the metal, but in terms of
enthalpy, kilocalories per 

00:10:27.533 --> 00:10:29.000
mole, it's uphill. 

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.167
However, once it gets up there,
these hydrogens can 

00:10:32.167 --> 00:10:35.000
move from one metal to the next,
because we're talking a 

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.900
solid metal, in this case. 

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:42.267
So in fact, it dissociates on
the palladium surface, and 

00:10:42.267 --> 00:10:43.833
then the hydrides move. 

00:10:43.833 --> 00:10:46.933
So you get an advantage from
entropy, from the hydrogens 

00:10:46.933 --> 00:10:48.600
getting apart, even though it's
uphill a 

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:50.200
little bit in energy. 

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:53.533
It's very favorable to move them
apart in entropy, rather 

00:10:53.533 --> 00:10:55.767
than having to have them right
next to one another. 

00:10:55.767 --> 00:11:00.333
So it's possible to dissociate
hydrogen on palladium. 

00:11:00.333 --> 00:11:04.667
Now here's a calculation
certainly better than the 

00:11:04.667 --> 00:11:05.567
previous one. 

00:11:05.567 --> 00:11:07.100
It was published in the Journal
of Physical 

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:08.967
Chemistry in 2004. 

00:11:08.967 --> 00:11:11.833
And it shows the same thing,
palladium approaching hydrogen 

00:11:11.833 --> 00:11:15.033
above, palladium approaching
methane below. 

00:11:15.033 --> 00:11:17.767
And again, I don't think that
these are great numbers, 

00:11:17.767 --> 00:11:20.500
probably, but it gives you the
idea of what I showed on the 

00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:24.267
previous slide, and some
specific geometries. 

00:11:24.267 --> 00:11:27.433
OK, now, catalytic hydrogenation
puts these two 

00:11:27.433 --> 00:11:30.100
reactions together that we just
looked at. 

00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:34.000
You have what inorganic chemists

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.467
call "oxidative addition." 

00:11:36.467 --> 00:11:40.500
That's where we do this, which
we just saw is possible, two 

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:43.033
electrons can get stabilized
because of the orbitals that 

00:11:43.033 --> 00:11:45.167
are available, to form something
like a 

00:11:45.167 --> 00:11:47.467
three-member ring here. 

00:11:47.467 --> 00:11:49.467
And that's called oxidative
addition. 

00:11:49.467 --> 00:11:52.500
The reason it's called oxidative
is the way inorganic 

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:54.033
chemists count electrons. 

00:11:54.033 --> 00:11:58.000
They say that if you have a bond
to metal, those electrons 

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.433
belong to the ligand, not to the
metal. 

00:12:01.433 --> 00:12:04.133
So electrons, formally, have
been taken 

00:12:04.133 --> 00:12:05.400
away from the metal. 

00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:07.067
We'll talk more about oxidation
and 

00:12:07.067 --> 00:12:08.800
reduction before too long. 

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:11.233
But anyhow, that's called
oxidative addition. 

00:12:11.233 --> 00:12:13.633
But of course, you could do the
reverse, as well. 

00:12:13.633 --> 00:12:16.500
You could do reductive
elimination, and pull the 

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:19.100
alkene back off again. 

00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:22.933
OK, now you do the same thing
with hydrogen, as we just saw. 

00:12:22.933 --> 00:12:25.800
So you could have oxidative
addition, those two arrows 

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:30.400
move like that, to give that,
and then the blue reverse, the 

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:34.167
reductive elimination, and
you're back where you started. 

00:12:34.167 --> 00:12:37.833
But now, suppose you do both of
these things. 

00:12:37.833 --> 00:12:41.367
Let's suppose that we first do
the oxidative addition, the 

00:12:41.367 --> 00:12:45.000
insertion of palladium into the
H-H bond, and one of the 

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.367
H's, let's say, moves away. 

00:12:47.367 --> 00:12:49.900
And now we have room on the
surface of the palladium, 

00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:52.267
there, to bring in the alkene
and do its trick. 

00:12:56.433 --> 00:12:59.533
So now, we have this form. 

00:12:59.533 --> 00:13:02.700
Now of course, you could do
reductive elimination again. 

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:06.300
Now incidentally, in that form,
the experts discuss just 

00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:08.200
how much the different bonds are
formed. 

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:10.900
Sometimes they draw it this way,
and just say the alkene 

00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:12.367
is complexed. 

00:13:12.367 --> 00:13:16.200
But that begs the question of
what is it that's holding the 

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:18.367
alkene there, and it's those
orbital interactions 

00:13:18.367 --> 00:13:19.167
that we looked at. 

00:13:19.167 --> 00:13:20.967
The electrons going one way, the

00:13:20.967 --> 00:13:22.533
electrons going the other. 

00:13:22.533 --> 00:13:27.833
So we'll for our purposes of our
lecture today, we'll say 

00:13:27.833 --> 00:13:29.933
that the bonds are completely
formed, even though 

00:13:29.933 --> 00:13:32.233
they may not be. 

00:13:32.233 --> 00:13:34.333
OK, so you can do reductive
elimination, it 

00:13:34.333 --> 00:13:35.767
could come off again. 

00:13:35.767 --> 00:13:39.933
But suppose you did the other
reductive elimination? 

00:13:39.933 --> 00:13:41.300
Suppose you did that one? 

00:13:44.833 --> 00:13:45.867
Now you're over here. 

00:13:45.867 --> 00:13:48.667
And you've put hydrogen on one
carbon, and 

00:13:48.667 --> 00:13:51.500
palladium on the other. 

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:53.800
Now suppose we have that
hydrogen that's wandering 

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:57.300
around the surface, suppose we
bring it back? 

00:13:57.300 --> 00:13:58.833
Can you see what I'm going to do
now? 

00:14:07.267 --> 00:14:11.267
Chris, do you have an idea of
what step is next? 

00:14:11.267 --> 00:14:12.733
Look at the title of the slide.

00:14:12.733 --> 00:14:16.467
STUDENT: We might hydrogenate? 

00:14:16.467 --> 00:14:18.700
PROFESSOR: Yeah, we want to put
a hydrogen on each of the 

00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:21.100
carbons, how are we going to do
that? 

00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:25.467
We've got a hydrogen on the
right carbon already, how do 

00:14:25.467 --> 00:14:27.967
we get a hydrogen on the left
carbon? 

00:14:27.967 --> 00:14:29.400
STUDENT: We have a hydrogen
nearby, that's 

00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:30.833
bonded to the palladium. 

00:14:30.833 --> 00:14:33.033
PROFESSOR: Yeah, and the carbon
is bonded to palladium. 

00:14:33.033 --> 00:14:37.933
And what will we call the
process that gets the hydrogen 

00:14:37.933 --> 00:14:41.400
bonded to carbon, instead of the
carbon and the hydrogen 

00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:42.400
bonded to palladium? 

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:43.900
STUDENT: Substitution? 

00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:45.133
PROFESSOR: Nope. 

00:14:49.867 --> 00:14:50.767
It's that. 

00:14:50.767 --> 00:14:53.733
Anybody got a name for that? 

00:14:53.733 --> 00:14:55.833
That's the reductive
elimination, the blue thing 

00:14:55.833 --> 00:14:57.467
we've been talking about, all
these, right? 

00:14:57.467 --> 00:15:00.233
They come on, they come off,
they come on, they come off. 

00:15:00.233 --> 00:15:02.733
But if you put them on one way,
and take them off a 

00:15:02.733 --> 00:15:05.433
different way, you've done the
trick. 

00:15:05.433 --> 00:15:07.000
Got it? 

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.667
OK. 

00:15:08.667 --> 00:15:12.667
Now, notice, that that addition
of the palladium, the 

00:15:12.667 --> 00:15:16.500
oxidative addition of alkene to
palladium, happened two at 

00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:19.000
the same time, so they come in
on the same face. 

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.933
It's a syn addition. 

00:15:20.933 --> 00:15:26.600
And then, when the hydrogens
replace palladium, they come 

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:27.767
in on the front side. 

00:15:27.767 --> 00:15:30.967
It's not a backside attack. 

00:15:30.967 --> 00:15:32.833
When we curve those two arrows,
it's 

00:15:32.833 --> 00:15:34.667
not attacking backside. 

00:15:34.667 --> 00:15:38.133
So, they come in from the same
side as well, so the overall 

00:15:38.133 --> 00:15:40.167
product is syn addition. 

00:15:40.167 --> 00:15:42.033
The H's came in on the same-- 

00:15:42.033 --> 00:15:44.467
here, the bottom face of the
double bond. 

00:15:44.467 --> 00:15:46.867
And of course, if you put methyl
groups on there, and it 

00:15:46.867 --> 00:15:50.400
were 2-butene, then you'd expect
to get that particular 

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:54.467
isomer of the 2-butene, where
the two hydrogens operated, 

00:15:54.467 --> 00:15:56.000
added on same side. 

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.767
Of course, you couldn't tell it,
because the other two 

00:15:58.767 --> 00:16:00.767
things would be hydrogens as
well. 

00:16:00.767 --> 00:16:03.667
How could you tell? 

00:16:03.667 --> 00:16:06.533
How could you tell that the two
came in on the same side? 

00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:11.267
PROFESSOR: You wouldn't you use
hydrogen, 

00:16:11.267 --> 00:16:11.667
what would you use? 

00:16:11.667 --> 00:16:13.033
STUDENT: Deuterium. 

00:16:13.033 --> 00:16:14.167
PROFESSOR: You'd use deuterium,
as you say. 

00:16:14.167 --> 00:16:16.367
Yeah, so then you could tell. 

00:16:16.367 --> 00:16:19.133
And here's an example, from the
book, where they use 

00:16:19.133 --> 00:16:23.433
deuterium and platinum oxide, in
this case, and the two D's 

00:16:23.433 --> 00:16:26.600
came in on the same side. 

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:30.200
That was not necessary, in this
case, to tell, because 

00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:32.733
you also have the cyclohexane
ring there. 

00:16:32.733 --> 00:16:35.167
So, it says here that deuterium
is 

00:16:35.167 --> 00:16:36.700
added in a syn fashion. 

00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:38.133
It's a syn addition. 

00:16:38.133 --> 00:16:41.833
And here's a typical passage
from another textbook, the 

00:16:41.833 --> 00:16:44.033
Loudon textbook that we used
several years ago, about 

00:16:44.033 --> 00:16:47.433
stereochemistry of this addition
reaction, catalytic 

00:16:47.433 --> 00:16:48.767
hydrogenation. 

00:16:48.767 --> 00:16:52.033
And it says, "stereospecific
syn-addition" happens, it 

00:16:52.033 --> 00:16:56.367
says, for "most alkenes." And it
gives this example. 

00:16:56.367 --> 00:16:59.867
But I'm actually doing this
little bit to show you how to 

00:16:59.867 --> 00:17:03.000
read text books. 

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.500
So it says, most alkenes do
this, and give stereospecific 

00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:08.100
syn-addition, and it gives an
example. 

00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:12.100
But notice, it doesn't say what
the yield is. 

00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:14.300
It could be one of these
things-- remember last time, 

00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:19.400
we said there was a 55:45, that
was said to be specific, 

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:21.800
or to favor one over the other.

00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:24.133
So it doesn't say what the yield
is. 

00:17:24.133 --> 00:17:26.633
And it doesn't give any
reference to the literature 

00:17:26.633 --> 00:17:28.900
where you could look up and see
what they yield was, or 

00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:32.333
how they did it, or how much of
the other isomer there 

00:17:32.333 --> 00:17:33.700
might have been there. 

00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:36.067
Now this is very typical for
textbooks, and I have no doubt 

00:17:36.067 --> 00:17:40.033
that this happens with high
specificity, in this case. 

00:17:40.033 --> 00:17:42.033
But on the other hand, you
shouldn't be 

00:17:42.033 --> 00:17:43.667
satisfied with that. 

00:17:43.667 --> 00:17:47.533
So you would look in another
book, like this book from 1972 

00:17:47.533 --> 00:17:49.700
by House, Modern Synthetic
Chemistry. 

00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:51.867
Now this is a graduate-level
text. 

00:17:51.867 --> 00:17:55.333
So it shows an example, here,
using palladium on carbon as 

00:17:55.333 --> 00:17:57.933
the catalyst. Palladium on
carbon means you have 

00:17:57.933 --> 00:18:00.733
palladium metal, but you don't
want to have a big chunk of 

00:18:00.733 --> 00:18:02.300
metal, because there's not much
surface. 

00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:04.567
So you want it to be very finely
divided, but you want 

00:18:04.567 --> 00:18:05.600
to be able to handle it. 

00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:08.467
You don't have very much, so you
put it on charcoal. 

00:18:08.467 --> 00:18:10.467
It's absorbed on the surface of
the charcoal. 

00:18:10.467 --> 00:18:12.767
So that's what palladium on
carbon is. 

00:18:12.767 --> 00:18:16.067
So it's done in acetic acid,
with hydrogen gas at one 

00:18:16.067 --> 00:18:18.933
atmosphere, and you have that
double bond. 

00:18:18.933 --> 00:18:21.267
And what do you would notice
about the stereochemistry of 

00:18:21.267 --> 00:18:22.233
the product? 

00:18:22.233 --> 00:18:25.000
Is it a syn addition? 

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.233
Which is the product of syn
addition? 

00:18:28.233 --> 00:18:28.700
Sebastian? 

00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:30.400
The one on the left or the
right? 

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:31.200
STUDENT: The one on the left. 

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:31.933
PROFESSOR: The one on the left.

00:18:31.933 --> 00:18:33.433
The two came in on the same
side. 

00:18:33.433 --> 00:18:35.967
On the right, one came in on the
top, one on the bottom. 

00:18:35.967 --> 00:18:41.033
And 90% of the product is the
wrong one, the one the book 

00:18:41.033 --> 00:18:43.300
tells you, or almost any book
will tell 

00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:44.333
you, is a syn addition. 

00:18:44.333 --> 00:18:47.233
And it often is. 

00:18:47.233 --> 00:18:51.500
Now, look at this example from
1948. 

00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:52.400
What's going on here? 

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:55.500
This is Barton in 1948. 

00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:58.400
Anybody else remember what
Barton was talking about in 

00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:01.333
1948 or '49, from last semester?

00:19:06.633 --> 00:19:09.000
That was the first
conformational analysis. 

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.533
And it was molecules very like
this. 

00:19:11.533 --> 00:19:14.833
So this is what he was working
on, these steroids. 

00:19:14.833 --> 00:19:18.700
But notice these two compounds
are allylic isomers. 

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:21.533
They only differ in the position
of that double bond. 

00:19:21.533 --> 00:19:24.467
There are three carbons in a
row, and a double bond between 

00:19:24.467 --> 00:19:26.000
two of them. 

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.867
That's an allylic system. 

00:19:27.867 --> 00:19:31.767
So these are isomers where you
move a hydrogen from the top 

00:19:31.767 --> 00:19:34.433
to the bottom, and now you have
a double bond here and a 

00:19:34.433 --> 00:19:35.400
single bond here. 

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:38.467
So those are allylic isomers. 

00:19:38.467 --> 00:19:41.500
And now if you look at the
details of this primary 

00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:44.533
literature, it says that there's
a rearrangement of one 

00:19:44.533 --> 00:19:47.567
of these compounds to the other,
right? 

00:19:47.567 --> 00:19:50.700
And it says that it happens in
80% yield. 

00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:54.433
80% of the product has gone from
here to here. 

00:19:54.433 --> 00:19:56.800
Now, this is what you would use
for catalytic 

00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:58.200
hydrogenation. 

00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:01.833
But instead of hydrogenating, it
first went by allylic 

00:20:01.833 --> 00:20:03.433
rearrangement. 

00:20:03.433 --> 00:20:05.067
Now, how did that happen? 

00:20:05.067 --> 00:20:07.733
So let's look back again at the
mechanism of the catalytic 

00:20:07.733 --> 00:20:08.600
hydrogenation. 

00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:12.233
First, you have the oxidative
addition of the double bond, 

00:20:12.233 --> 00:20:14.400
and then you have the reductive
elimination, on the 

00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:17.200
right, to put the first hydrogen
on. 

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:19.200
And then you put the other
hydrogen on 

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:21.500
the left, and continue. 

00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:23.967
Of course that reaction would be
reversible. 

00:20:23.967 --> 00:20:31.700
You could have taken this back
off again, in the wrong way, 

00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:37.500
and instead of going there,
pardon me, you could go there. 

00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:42.533
But the other thing you could
have done is, if there's an 

00:20:42.533 --> 00:20:45.800
allylic hydrogen in the compound
you're talking about, 

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:48.467
so not only the alkene, but the
next door carbon has a 

00:20:48.467 --> 00:20:50.367
hydrogen on it, you're here,
you're here, you're here, 

00:20:50.367 --> 00:20:54.300
you're here, you get to there. 

00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:55.067
OK? 

00:20:55.067 --> 00:20:58.933
And now, one possibility is to
reverse that way. 

00:20:58.933 --> 00:21:02.667
That's the reductive
elimination, or pardon me, 

00:21:02.667 --> 00:21:05.367
oxidative addition that takes
you back here, that undoes 

00:21:05.367 --> 00:21:08.467
those blue arrows, and would
take you back. 

00:21:08.467 --> 00:21:09.933
But what other option is there?

00:21:09.933 --> 00:21:11.467
Can anybody see another option?

00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:18.067
Liang? 

00:21:18.067 --> 00:21:19.433
STUDENT: The other side. 

00:21:19.433 --> 00:21:23.233
PROFESSOR: Aha, that compound is
symmetric, if you have an 

00:21:23.233 --> 00:21:25.667
allylic hydrogen. 

00:21:25.667 --> 00:21:27.733
So it could unzip that way, too.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:37.633
And now, instead of going back
to this, you go back to this. 

00:21:37.633 --> 00:21:42.533
And if that does the reductive
elimination, 

00:21:42.533 --> 00:21:44.500
you come back here. 

00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:49.233
And now, you'll notice that has
isomerized the alkene. 

00:21:49.233 --> 00:21:50.900
The double bond moved next door.

00:21:53.733 --> 00:21:56.267
So it's all these oxidative
addition reductive 

00:21:56.267 --> 00:21:59.100
eliminations, but if you go
through that symmetric 

00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:01.700
intermediate, then you can take
the wrong one off as you 

00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:04.600
go back toward starting
material. 

00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:07.333
So the starting material is
actually isomerized product. 

00:22:07.333 --> 00:22:09.800
So that's presumably how it
happens. 

00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:13.833
So catalytic hydrogenation can
lead to allylic rearrangement. 

00:22:13.833 --> 00:22:17.833
And now let's go back and look
at that paper. 

00:22:17.833 --> 00:22:22.933
And we see that if we had that
rearrangement, this could go 

00:22:22.933 --> 00:22:25.300
to this, in fact, it could go to
four different isomers. 

00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:26.733
It could be the double bond
here, or 

00:22:26.733 --> 00:22:29.333
here, or here, or here. 

00:22:29.333 --> 00:22:30.767
So we could come back to this. 

00:22:30.767 --> 00:22:34.333
And now, once you're here, if
you add hydrogen, even if you 

00:22:34.333 --> 00:22:37.633
add them from the same side,
those two hydrogens, they 

00:22:37.633 --> 00:22:39.400
could be the opposite side from
where the 

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:42.067
first hydrogen was. 

00:22:42.067 --> 00:22:45.133
So now you could expect to get
this, and you'd expect more of 

00:22:45.133 --> 00:22:48.800
this than this, because that
form is more stable. 

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:54.000
It's conformationally a better
structure. 

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:55.500
OK, so 90% there. 

00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:58.367
Now, the nice thing is you don't
have to even look at the 

00:22:58.367 --> 00:23:01.067
secondary literature, you go
back to the primary 

00:23:01.067 --> 00:23:03.433
literature, because it gives a
reference here. 

00:23:03.433 --> 00:23:06.400
So we can look at that
reference, and see here where 

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:09.633
they give the table about
studying these things. 

00:23:09.633 --> 00:23:12.800
And down here, in row 7, you see
they're talking about 

00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:16.900
compound VII, delta-9,10-octalin
So the ring 

00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:19.400
is numbered in a certain way,
and that double bond is 

00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:22.667
between nine and ten. 

00:23:22.667 --> 00:23:27.167
Now, if they started with that
material, you see they got 90% 

00:23:27.167 --> 00:23:28.667
of the trans product. 

00:23:28.667 --> 00:23:33.900
That's this one, that's what
shown here: 90%, 10%. 

00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:37.433
But if they did only partial
hydrogenation, they still got 

00:23:37.433 --> 00:23:41.667
90% of this, but they had 100%--

00:23:41.667 --> 00:23:44.467
after doing 80% of the
hydrogenation. 

00:23:44.467 --> 00:23:46.900
It says down here they did it
80%. 

00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:49.967
After doing that, they don't
have any of this stuff. 

00:23:49.967 --> 00:23:52.700
It's all this stuff. 

00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:57.633
So if these things can go back
and forth, it must be that the 

00:23:57.633 --> 00:24:00.400
equilibrium lies in this
direction. 

00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:02.433
And occasionally, when you get
over here, you 

00:24:02.433 --> 00:24:05.467
go on to the product. 

00:24:05.467 --> 00:24:08.133
And that's the explanation of
it. 

00:24:08.133 --> 00:24:10.967
But it's interesting to look
even a little closer, to look 

00:24:10.967 --> 00:24:13.933
at what happened if they started
with VIII. 

00:24:13.933 --> 00:24:17.533
So suppose they start with VIII.

00:24:17.533 --> 00:24:21.400
If you start at VII, and you can
go through VIII to get 

00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:24.033
down here, you get 90% of the
product. 

00:24:24.033 --> 00:24:25.933
That's their explanation. 

00:24:25.933 --> 00:24:27.900
Suppose you start with pure
VIII. 

00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:29.167
What should you get? 

00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:33.267
In terms of the product. 

00:24:33.267 --> 00:24:37.233
If you didn't have VII, if you
start with VIII. 

00:24:37.233 --> 00:24:38.733
Debby, you got an idea? 

00:24:38.733 --> 00:24:41.567
STUDENT: Wouldn't you get the
one below? 

00:24:41.567 --> 00:24:45.567
PROFESSOR: You should get at
least this much, maybe more. 

00:24:45.567 --> 00:24:46.233
Right? 

00:24:46.233 --> 00:24:49.633
If the way you get here-- if
some of it goes this way, and 

00:24:49.633 --> 00:24:53.333
some of it goes this way, and
you start here and get 10 to 

00:24:53.333 --> 00:24:56.367
90, if you start here, you
should get even 

00:24:56.367 --> 00:24:59.033
more than 90 to 10. 

00:24:59.033 --> 00:25:00.400
Because you don't have the
chance 

00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:02.400
of going here initially. 

00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:03.700
Got it? 

00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:07.133
OK, what does it say? 

00:25:07.133 --> 00:25:10.633
You get 80%. 

00:25:10.633 --> 00:25:13.000
So there's something rotten
here, but no one's ever 

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:14.133
talked about it. 

00:25:14.133 --> 00:25:16.333
It could be just that the
experiments weren't done 

00:25:16.333 --> 00:25:19.733
really carefully, or maybe the
catalyst was a little bit 

00:25:19.733 --> 00:25:21.267
different in one case than the
other. 

00:25:21.267 --> 00:25:23.000
I don't know what the answer is.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.867
But it's when you go back to dig
in to where the real 

00:25:26.867 --> 00:25:30.200
results are that you find things
that are interesting. 

00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:33.967
So evidently, this isn't 100%
understood. 

00:25:33.967 --> 00:25:38.367
But I have no doubt that this
allylic rearrangement is a big 

00:25:38.367 --> 00:25:41.500
source of getting what appears
to be the wrong addition. 

00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:44.933
that it really is syn addition,
but it happens after 

00:25:44.933 --> 00:25:46.100
you've rearranged things. 

00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:50.400
So the product isn't what you
would have expected, naively. 

00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:56.133
OK, now, a process called
metathesis of an alkene. 

00:25:56.133 --> 00:26:01.700
This was reported when I first
came here to Yale, the first 

00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:04.000
year I was here, and it was
amazing. 

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.500
People were amazed by this
reaction. 

00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:11.400
And the mechanism was quite
speculative. 

00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:13.967
Nobody had any idea what
happened at the beginning. 

00:26:13.967 --> 00:26:17.567
But in the subsequent whatever
number of years, 45 years, 

00:26:17.567 --> 00:26:19.067
it's been figured out. 

00:26:19.067 --> 00:26:22.367
And what is involved is a double
bond from 

00:26:22.367 --> 00:26:24.433
the metal to carbon. 

00:26:24.433 --> 00:26:26.767
Of course, there are there two
other things on the carbon. 

00:26:26.767 --> 00:26:29.533
But this is called an alkylidene
complex. 

00:26:29.533 --> 00:26:34.467
And in fact, this process was
the basis for the Nobel Prize 

00:26:34.467 --> 00:26:39.133
in 2005, which went to Grubbs. 

00:26:39.133 --> 00:26:42.733
So this is a metal alkylidene
complex. 

00:26:42.733 --> 00:26:48.367
We can come in with an alkene,
and do the oxidative addition, 

00:26:48.367 --> 00:26:51.100
to form that, and a reductive
elimination. 

00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:54.300
So it gives a metalla-
cyclobutane 

00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:57.033
a cyclobutane that has a metal
in it. 

00:26:57.033 --> 00:26:59.133
Just by the same processes we
talked about on 

00:26:59.133 --> 00:27:01.967
the previous slide. 

00:27:01.967 --> 00:27:05.267
Now, those processes are
reversible. 

00:27:05.267 --> 00:27:07.233
And what do you notice about
reversing it? 

00:27:07.233 --> 00:27:08.767
Liang? 

00:27:08.767 --> 00:27:10.767
What about the intermediate
here? 

00:27:10.767 --> 00:27:11.767
STUDENT: It's symmetrical. 

00:27:11.767 --> 00:27:13.400
PROFESSOR: It's symmetrical. 

00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:18.767
So you can reverse the other
direction, to go to there, and 

00:27:18.767 --> 00:27:21.433
then that can come apart. 

00:27:21.433 --> 00:27:25.467
And you've put the central
carbon, the one that's here, 

00:27:25.467 --> 00:27:27.800
changed it from being attached
to this carbon to being 

00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:29.333
attached to this carbon. 

00:27:29.333 --> 00:27:33.233
So you can take, effectively,
two alkenes, and mix up their 

00:27:33.233 --> 00:27:37.767
carbons, which is double- bonded
to which. 

00:27:37.767 --> 00:27:44.433
Now, you've heard of Professor
Ziegler, who last semester 

00:27:44.433 --> 00:27:48.100
taught the other organic course.

00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:50.133
I don't know if you've seen him
around in the lab, maybe. 

00:27:50.133 --> 00:27:53.767
He's unusually tall, he's 6' 6",
or something like that. 

00:27:53.767 --> 00:27:55.733
And I point out, here, that he's
not 

00:27:55.733 --> 00:27:57.133
Professor Karl Ziegler. 

00:27:57.133 --> 00:27:58.633
We'll talk about Professor Karl
Ziegler 

00:27:58.633 --> 00:28:00.633
a few slides later. 

00:28:00.633 --> 00:28:04.800
But he was visiting Japan, in
1986, and this delegation of 

00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:08.367
junior high girls thought he was
so tall, they should get 

00:28:08.367 --> 00:28:10.800
their picture taken with him,
which is here. 

00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:12.900
But he wasn't the only tall guy
visiting 

00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:14.100
Japan at that time. 

00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:17.467
Here he is, touring together
with Professor Grubbs, the guy 

00:28:17.467 --> 00:28:21.233
that got the Nobel Prize in
2005, who's equally tall. 

00:28:21.233 --> 00:28:24.500
In fact, Professor Grubbs's
daughter played 

00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:25.733
basketball at Yale. 

00:28:25.733 --> 00:28:26.400
She's quite tall. 

00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:28.700
I think she holds the rebounding
record for women's 

00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:30.100
basketball at Yale. 

00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:34.167
So this'll help you remember
Professor Grubbs, I hope. 

00:28:34.167 --> 00:28:36.433
In fact, they took another
picture together with their 

00:28:36.433 --> 00:28:39.867
host, Professor Murahashi. 

00:28:39.867 --> 00:28:44.100
So again, I underline that
they're unusually tall people. 

00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:48.467
OK, but Grubbs invented a
process called ROMP: 

00:28:48.467 --> 00:28:53.000
ring-opening metathesis
polymerization. 

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:56.900
Now here's a double bond where
both of the carbons in the 

00:28:56.900 --> 00:29:00.800
double bond are part of the same
molecule, I mean, the 

00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:02.533
same framework. 

00:29:02.533 --> 00:29:06.100
So if you cleave that double
bond, and exchange partners 

00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:10.567
with something else, you still
have the two linked together 

00:29:10.567 --> 00:29:13.100
through this other ring. 

00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:16.133
So if you bring in this
alkylidene compound, and do 

00:29:16.133 --> 00:29:20.533
the trick of metathesis, you get
that. 

00:29:20.533 --> 00:29:26.200
And now the product is still an
alkylidene ruthenium here, 

00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:27.333
so you can do that with another

00:29:27.333 --> 00:29:29.033
one of these molecules. 

00:29:29.033 --> 00:29:32.433
In fact, you can do with the n
of the molecules, and they'll 

00:29:32.433 --> 00:29:36.667
all link together in a chain
like this, to give a polymer. 

00:29:36.667 --> 00:29:40.667
So this ring opening metathesis
was a very 

00:29:40.667 --> 00:29:44.767
important part of this Nobel
Prize work 

00:29:44.767 --> 00:29:47.400
to generate a polymer. 

00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:50.267
OK, now catalytic hydrogenation,
we 

00:29:50.267 --> 00:29:52.333
saw, looked like this. 

00:29:52.333 --> 00:29:55.900
But Ziegler-Natta
polymerization, this is the 

00:29:55.900 --> 00:30:01.400
other Ziegler, Karl Ziegler, a
German, looks very similar. 

00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:06.800
So it has titanium, with an R
group on it. 

00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:13.700
An alkene comes in, oxidative
addition, to give this. 

00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:18.633
Reductive elimination, on the
other side gives that. 

00:30:18.633 --> 00:30:23.567
But now, that we could just call
a different R group. 

00:30:23.567 --> 00:30:25.933
It's not the original R group,
it's the R group with two 

00:30:25.933 --> 00:30:29.433
carbons in between, that we just
brought in. 

00:30:29.433 --> 00:30:30.667
Now what can you do? 

00:30:34.167 --> 00:30:37.467
You can bring it back to start
over again, right? 

00:30:37.467 --> 00:30:40.100
And that'll be the R, and then
you bring it in, and that's 

00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:42.700
the R. And then you do it again,
and again, and again, 

00:30:42.700 --> 00:30:46.433
and you can make a very long
chain of ethylene molecules, 

00:30:46.433 --> 00:30:47.767
for example. 

00:30:47.767 --> 00:30:49.267
Now, Ziegler found this-- 

00:30:49.267 --> 00:30:53.633
I contacted Grubbs, yesterday,
in order to get permission to 

00:30:53.633 --> 00:30:57.633
show his picture to you, and
Murahashi as well, and 

00:30:57.633 --> 00:30:58.933
Ziegler, incidentally. 

00:30:58.933 --> 00:31:02.933
But he told me an interesting
story of how Ziegler 

00:31:02.933 --> 00:31:04.833
discovered this. 

00:31:04.833 --> 00:31:08.000
It was during the second World
War, and in Germany they were 

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.033
short of lubricating oil. 

00:31:10.033 --> 00:31:13.167
So he was trying to figure out
how to use triethyl aluminum 

00:31:13.167 --> 00:31:17.833
to add to alkenes, and then
polymerize on the basis of 

00:31:17.833 --> 00:31:20.833
that to get things that could be
lubricating oils. 

00:31:20.833 --> 00:31:23.733
And after the war, he continued
that work, but 

00:31:23.733 --> 00:31:27.367
sometimes they found different
products, rather than these 

00:31:27.367 --> 00:31:28.700
oils they were trying to make. 

00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:31.300
And they traced it to the
presence of 

00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:33.867
metals in the reactor. 

00:31:33.867 --> 00:31:36.333
So then they tried all different
salts, and when they 

00:31:36.333 --> 00:31:40.667
used titanium tetrachloride,
they found that they had made 

00:31:40.667 --> 00:31:45.533
a heterogeneous catalyst for
polymerization, the thing that 

00:31:45.533 --> 00:31:46.533
I've shown here. 

00:31:46.533 --> 00:31:49.100
Now I underline that this is
heterogeneous. 

00:31:49.100 --> 00:31:51.800
You mix these things together,
it's a witch's brew, and 

00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:54.633
nobody knows, really, exactly
what's in there. 

00:31:54.633 --> 00:31:58.767
And the reason you don't know is
because it's a solid. 

00:31:58.767 --> 00:32:01.633
It's not a pure crystalline
compound, it's not something 

00:32:01.633 --> 00:32:04.267
in solution that you could do
spectroscopy on to figure out 

00:32:04.267 --> 00:32:05.700
exactly what it is. 

00:32:05.700 --> 00:32:08.133
So it's very hard to study
mechanism with these 

00:32:08.133 --> 00:32:09.800
heterogeneous catalysts. 

00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:12.000
But that doesn't mean they're
not useful. 

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:15.600
For example, high density
polyethylene, the number two 

00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:20.433
of your recycling thing, with ns
of from 800 to a quarter 

00:32:20.433 --> 00:32:25.833
million chain lengths, was made
in 2004 to the tune of 25 

00:32:25.833 --> 00:32:29.933
times 10 to the sixth tons, 25
million tons. 

00:32:29.933 --> 00:32:36.000
Or polypropylene, with up to 10
to the 5 units in a chain, 

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:39.967
again, 45 million tons in 2007.

00:32:39.967 --> 00:32:44.000
So this Ziegler-Natta catalyst
was a really revolutionary 

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.400
thing for making polymers. 

00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:50.333
But it was hard to do the
mechanisms. 

00:32:50.333 --> 00:32:54.600
Now, one thing that we'll see
later, that free radicals also 

00:32:54.600 --> 00:33:00.567
can polymerize things, can
polymerize alkenes. 

00:33:00.567 --> 00:33:04.433
But a difference here is that
these are isotactic, that you 

00:33:04.433 --> 00:33:08.567
get from Ziegler-Natta
polymerization. 

00:33:08.567 --> 00:33:12.567
So I should tell you what
tacticity is. 

00:33:12.567 --> 00:33:16.667
So if you have a polymer chain,
and the alkenes had, 

00:33:16.667 --> 00:33:20.233
say, methyl groups on them,
propylene instead of ethylene, 

00:33:20.233 --> 00:33:21.567
then you have a bunch of
stereocenters. 

00:33:24.233 --> 00:33:28.233
Now, notice that every alkene
went in head to tail, that is, 

00:33:28.233 --> 00:33:34.100
CH2 then CH, CH2, CHCH3, CH2,
CHCH3. 

00:33:34.100 --> 00:33:36.300
CH2, CH, CH3. 

00:33:36.300 --> 00:33:40.067
So it's head to tail, but it's
stereoregular. 

00:33:40.067 --> 00:33:42.500
All the methyls are coming out
that you. 

00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:45.733
And that's called isotactic. 

00:33:45.733 --> 00:33:49.533
An alternative would be all head
to tail 

00:33:49.533 --> 00:33:54.000
but syndiotactic: out, back,
out, back, out, 

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:55.267
back, every other one. 

00:33:58.033 --> 00:34:00.767
And of course it could be
random. 

00:34:00.767 --> 00:34:02.233
Out and back. 

00:34:02.233 --> 00:34:05.600
So there are these three
different fundamental types of 

00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:10.133
polymers: isotactic,
syndiotactic, and atactic. 

00:34:10.133 --> 00:34:12.200
And they have different
properties, and we'll talk 

00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:15.067
about polymer properties in the
next lecture, and why they 

00:34:15.067 --> 00:34:16.400
should be different. 

00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:20.767
So for some purposes you'd want
one, for some another. 

00:34:20.767 --> 00:34:23.167
Now there are two questions that
we'll address here. 

00:34:23.167 --> 00:34:25.233
One is, how do you know which is
which? 

00:34:25.233 --> 00:34:27.700
How do you know whether you have
an isotactic or a 

00:34:27.700 --> 00:34:29.233
syndiotactic or atactic. 

00:34:29.233 --> 00:34:32.033
And for that, you've got to wait
until we get to NMR, it's 

00:34:32.033 --> 00:34:33.000
coming very soon. 

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:36.100
It's a really neat way to figure
out which is which. 

00:34:36.100 --> 00:34:38.867
But a more fundamental question
is, how do you 

00:34:38.867 --> 00:34:42.333
control what you make? 

00:34:42.333 --> 00:34:46.567
So there are these catalysts,
instead of using titanium, use 

00:34:46.567 --> 00:34:50.333
these zirconium catalysts, which
are homogeneous. 

00:34:50.333 --> 00:34:53.900
That means they're dissolved
they're not some solid that's 

00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:55.400
in there. So it's possible to do

00:34:55.400 --> 00:34:57.233
spectroscopy on these things. 

00:34:57.233 --> 00:35:00.100
And Kaminsky, the name
associated with this 

00:35:00.100 --> 00:35:04.533
catalysis, has to do with his
accidental discovery that 

00:35:04.533 --> 00:35:08.633
adding MAO makes these very
reactive. 

00:35:08.633 --> 00:35:13.400
MAO is methylaluminoxane, which
is a sophisticated name 

00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:16.633
for something that nobody knows
what it is. 

00:35:16.633 --> 00:35:19.267
You mix stuff together and you
get that, and it's 

00:35:19.267 --> 00:35:20.700
not always the same. 

00:35:20.700 --> 00:35:25.400
But if you add it to the
zirconium dichloride 

00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:29.533
complexes, you get a very active
catalyst. So there have 

00:35:29.533 --> 00:35:33.633
been, I think, since this was
discovered in 1980, there have 

00:35:33.633 --> 00:35:37.033
been something like 7,000 papers
written on it, or 

00:35:37.033 --> 00:35:41.267
something like that, and 2,000
patents. 

00:35:41.267 --> 00:35:44.733
Now one thing that's pretty much
agreed on is that what 

00:35:44.733 --> 00:35:49.233
this methylaluminoxane takes the
chlorides off, puts an R 

00:35:49.233 --> 00:35:51.900
group like methyl on the
zirconium, and 

00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:53.167
leaves it as a cation. 

00:35:55.467 --> 00:35:57.933
Now, what happens next? 

00:35:57.933 --> 00:36:03.500
The alkenes approach, but they
approach from alternate faces. 

00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:05.100
Let's see what that means. 

00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:08.400
So here we take propylene, and
bring it into the front to 

00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:10.933
make one of these complexes. 

00:36:10.933 --> 00:36:16.233
And then the R group shifts
across, and you make a bond. 

00:36:16.233 --> 00:36:20.033
Have you ever seen a reaction
like that, where you have a 

00:36:20.033 --> 00:36:23.100
metal with a group attached to
it, alkene comes up, and you 

00:36:23.100 --> 00:36:25.200
form a bond here and this thing
comes over? 

00:36:30.633 --> 00:36:33.567
The BH, hydroboration, is
exactly that 

00:36:33.567 --> 00:36:34.800
same kind of thing. 

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:40.133
So we'll call that new group R
prime. 

00:36:40.133 --> 00:36:41.933
The original one was R . 

00:36:41.933 --> 00:36:45.033
But now the next alkene comes in
and associates with the 

00:36:45.033 --> 00:36:48.133
zirconium, but what's different
from 

00:36:48.133 --> 00:36:50.667
the first one I drew? 

00:36:50.667 --> 00:36:53.233
It's now in the back. 

00:36:53.233 --> 00:36:55.433
The first alkene came in in the
front. 

00:36:55.433 --> 00:36:58.900
So it goes in the back, now the
R prime moves back there, 

00:36:58.900 --> 00:37:02.433
and then the next alkene comes
in in front. 

00:37:02.433 --> 00:37:03.900
And it comes over there. 

00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:05.000
And so on, and so on. 

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:07.067
And you build a long chain. 

00:37:07.067 --> 00:37:10.800
But notice, every other one is
reacting in front, in back, in 

00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:12.267
front, in back. 

00:37:12.267 --> 00:37:15.033
Now let's compare the front and
back of 

00:37:15.033 --> 00:37:17.900
this zirconium complex. 

00:37:17.900 --> 00:37:21.533
Notice it has an axis of
symmetry there. 

00:37:21.533 --> 00:37:24.700
If you rotate 180 degrees about
that axis of symmetry, 

00:37:24.700 --> 00:37:26.600
you get the same thing again. 

00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:28.833
So the front and the back are
superimposable. 

00:37:28.833 --> 00:37:30.733
They look just the same. 

00:37:30.733 --> 00:37:33.033
So whatever happens in front
with respect to 

00:37:33.033 --> 00:37:37.200
stereochemistry will happen the
same way in back. 

00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:41.867
So the two faces, front and
back, are homotopic, they're 

00:37:41.867 --> 00:37:45.767
the same, so you'll get the same
chemistry, the same 

00:37:45.767 --> 00:37:48.067
stereochemistry, at either one.

00:37:48.067 --> 00:37:51.267
Now how is it different in this
case? That instead of 

00:37:51.267 --> 00:37:54.567
having an axis of symmetry has a
mirror plane of symmetry. 

00:37:54.567 --> 00:37:57.733
What does that mean about the
front and the back? 

00:37:57.733 --> 00:37:58.033
Sebastian? 

00:37:58.033 --> 00:38:00.267
What do you say? 

00:38:00.267 --> 00:38:01.667
What's the relationship between
the 

00:38:01.667 --> 00:38:03.467
front and the back? 

00:38:03.467 --> 00:38:05.467
Are they superimposable? 

00:38:05.467 --> 00:38:06.833
STUDENT: No. 

00:38:06.833 --> 00:38:08.433
PROFESSOR: So what would you
call them? 

00:38:08.433 --> 00:38:09.300
STUDENT: Enantiotopic 

00:38:09.300 --> 00:38:11.267
PROFESSOR: Right, so those are
enantiotopic. 

00:38:11.267 --> 00:38:13.800
So whatever the one's face does,
the other one will do 

00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:15.800
the opposite. 

00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:18.100
And as you bounce back and
forth, what product are you 

00:38:18.100 --> 00:38:19.267
going to get now? 

00:38:19.267 --> 00:38:20.667
STUDENT: Syndiotactic 

00:38:20.667 --> 00:38:21.933
PROFESSOR: It'll be
syndiotactic. 

00:38:24.667 --> 00:38:27.867
And now suppose you take this
one, which has a horizontal 

00:38:27.867 --> 00:38:31.633
plane, which means the top and
the bottom are both 

00:38:31.633 --> 00:38:32.200
accessible. 

00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:35.767
On the front, you can go either
to the top or to the 

00:38:35.767 --> 00:38:37.533
bottom, equally. 

00:38:37.533 --> 00:38:38.867
So there's no selection. 

00:38:38.867 --> 00:38:42.033
So what do you think you're
going to get now? 

00:38:42.033 --> 00:38:44.033
If it doesn't make any
difference which way you go. 

00:38:47.133 --> 00:38:50.233
Now the faces are achiral, and
you get an atactic product. 

00:38:50.233 --> 00:38:53.167
So you can control which one you
get by choosing the 

00:38:53.167 --> 00:38:57.433
symmetry of the ligand that's
attached to the zirconium. 

00:39:00.233 --> 00:39:03.367
Now as I said, as I promised,
you can also do free-radical 

00:39:03.367 --> 00:39:04.167
polymerization. 

00:39:04.167 --> 00:39:06.867
I said we'd discuss that. 

00:39:06.867 --> 00:39:10.300
This was the earliest kind of
polymerization studied in 

00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:11.800
laboratories. 

00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:15.467
So alkene comes in, bingo. 

00:39:15.467 --> 00:39:16.667
Another one, bingo. 

00:39:16.667 --> 00:39:17.133
Bingo. 

00:39:17.133 --> 00:39:17.500
Bingo. 

00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:17.800
Bingo. 

00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:19.733
So we're growing a long chain. 

00:39:19.733 --> 00:39:23.333
But the difference is that in
this case, you can get 

00:39:23.333 --> 00:39:28.900
rotation around this bond to get
that form. 

00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:33.300
And when you do, that radical is
close to this hydrogen. 

00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:36.167
And you can go from a primary
radical 

00:39:36.167 --> 00:39:39.867
to a secondary radical. 

00:39:39.867 --> 00:39:42.367
That's downhill. 

00:39:42.367 --> 00:39:44.800
And now you can add an alkene to
that. 

00:39:47.533 --> 00:39:51.267
So if you do radical
polymerization, as opposed to 

00:39:51.267 --> 00:39:55.233
doing these metal-catalyzed
polymerizations, you can get 

00:39:55.233 --> 00:40:00.000
branches, you get occasional
butyl chains, C4 chains, stuck 

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:01.500
on your long chain. 

00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:04.833
And that means that they don't
pack together as efficiently, 

00:40:04.833 --> 00:40:07.733
so it's not as crystalline. 

00:40:07.733 --> 00:40:11.733
So since it doesn't pack as
well, it's not as dense. 

00:40:11.733 --> 00:40:15.133
So that gives low density
polyethylene, the kind of 

00:40:15.133 --> 00:40:18.933
stuff that you get in dry
cleaner bags, the flimsy 

00:40:18.933 --> 00:40:22.167
stuff, as opposed to what you
would get in a supermarket 

00:40:22.167 --> 00:40:26.267
to carry groceries in, which is
tougher, and opaque. 

00:40:28.733 --> 00:40:29.933
Now let's look at it again. 

00:40:29.933 --> 00:40:32.733
We start polymerization going,
fine, free-radical 

00:40:32.733 --> 00:40:33.967
polymerization. 

00:40:33.967 --> 00:40:38.200
But, we may not want it to keep
going, because properties 

00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:41.467
of the polymer, like its
viscosity, its melting point, 

00:40:41.467 --> 00:40:43.267
depend on how long the chain is.

00:40:43.267 --> 00:40:45.667
We may want to control how long
the chain is. 

00:40:45.667 --> 00:40:49.733
How could we control the length
of the chain? 

00:40:49.733 --> 00:40:53.233
One way to control the polymer
chain length is to add a 

00:40:53.233 --> 00:40:55.933
molecule, like carbon
tetrachloride. 

00:40:55.933 --> 00:40:58.033
There are many such reagents,
not just carbon 

00:40:58.033 --> 00:40:59.467
tetrachloride. 

00:40:59.467 --> 00:41:01.700
OK, now, the radical can attack
the 

00:41:01.700 --> 00:41:03.400
chlorine, like this. 

00:41:06.433 --> 00:41:08.567
And now you have a
trichloromethyl radical, and 

00:41:08.567 --> 00:41:11.000
your chain is done. 

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:14.367
But, you have the
trichloromethyl radical. So it 

00:41:14.367 --> 00:41:15.800
can add to another alkene. 

00:41:19.267 --> 00:41:22.233
And then that one can grow a new
chain. 

00:41:22.233 --> 00:41:26.833
So you see, what you've done by
this is used what's called 

00:41:26.833 --> 00:41:29.133
a chain-transfer agent. 

00:41:29.133 --> 00:41:34.267
It doesn't destroy the kinetic
chain. The radical still keeps 

00:41:34.267 --> 00:41:36.833
working, but on a new molecule.

00:41:36.833 --> 00:41:40.067
So you shorten the polymer
molecules without terminating 

00:41:40.067 --> 00:41:41.433
the chain reaction. 

00:41:41.433 --> 00:41:44.300
So if you add more of the chain-
transfer agent, you get 

00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:46.233
shorter chains. 

00:41:46.233 --> 00:41:49.367
So if you measure the rate of
the transfer, the reaction 

00:41:49.367 --> 00:41:52.367
with the carbon tetrachloride,
versus the rate constant for 

00:41:52.367 --> 00:41:56.000
polymerization, in the
particular case of styrene and 

00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:00.667
carbon tetrachloride, that ratio
was 0.01. 

00:42:00.667 --> 00:42:04.767
So, if you don't have to worry
about radicals finding 

00:42:04.767 --> 00:42:08.167
radicals, they're rather dilute,
then the molecular 

00:42:08.167 --> 00:42:13.233
length will be how likely it is
to react with styrene 

00:42:13.233 --> 00:42:15.733
compared to how likely it is to
react with carbon 

00:42:15.733 --> 00:42:18.200
tetrachloride and terminate the
chain. 

00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:20.733
But that depends on the
concentration of styrene, and 

00:42:20.733 --> 00:42:21.333
the concentration. 

00:42:21.333 --> 00:42:27.500
So if you know these two, you
can then work out-- 

00:42:27.500 --> 00:42:35.367
since the transfer reaction with
this process here is only 

00:42:35.367 --> 00:42:36.733
1% as fast. 

00:42:36.733 --> 00:42:39.333
So if you had equal amounts of
styrene and carbon 

00:42:39.333 --> 00:42:43.600
tetrachloride, you'd tend to go
about 100 molecules before 

00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:44.933
you got a chain transfer. 

00:42:44.933 --> 00:42:48.700
So you get, on average, about
100 molecular-- 

00:42:48.700 --> 00:42:50.633
100 units in a chain. 

00:42:50.633 --> 00:42:52.933
If you had more carbon
tetrachloride, you'd get 

00:42:52.933 --> 00:42:53.700
shorter chains. 

00:42:53.700 --> 00:42:55.267
If you had less, you'd get
longer chains. 

00:42:55.267 --> 00:42:57.767
So you can control it, but not
precisely. 

00:42:57.767 --> 00:43:01.900
There's a property called
dispersity, which is they're 

00:43:01.900 --> 00:43:04.300
not all exactly the same length,
they're average that, 

00:43:04.300 --> 00:43:05.767
but some are longer, some are
shorter. 

00:43:05.767 --> 00:43:10.033
And how wide is this determines
something about, 

00:43:10.033 --> 00:43:14.067
obviously, the properties of the
material you get. 

00:43:14.067 --> 00:43:16.400
Ok, we won't go into that any
further. 

00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:19.333
Now alkene and diene
oligomerization and 

00:43:19.333 --> 00:43:22.833
polymerization, using carbon
electrophiles 

00:43:22.833 --> 00:43:24.667
as the active reagents. 

00:43:24.667 --> 00:43:28.567
Now oligo- means a few, so
oligomerization is putting 

00:43:28.567 --> 00:43:31.200
just a few such units together.

00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:35.567
And so we're going to use either
sigma-star of R with a 

00:43:35.567 --> 00:43:41.733
leaving group, or R cations as
the reagent to do the 

00:43:41.733 --> 00:43:44.033
polymerization. 

00:43:44.033 --> 00:43:49.233
So if you have R+ as an
electrophile, you do a really 

00:43:49.233 --> 00:43:51.167
interesting reaction. 

00:43:51.167 --> 00:43:55.233
Notice you can take isobutane
and isobutylene, react them 

00:43:55.233 --> 00:44:01.067
with H2SO4, and add the elements
of the isobutane, and 

00:44:01.067 --> 00:44:04.333
I've colored them because you
can do isotopic labeling to 

00:44:04.333 --> 00:44:05.600
see what's what. 

00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:08.400
Notice that what added to the
alkene was 

00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:11.967
this C-H sigma bond. 

00:44:11.967 --> 00:44:14.100
How do you like that, Noelle? 

00:44:14.100 --> 00:44:16.833
Can you see any problem with
doing a reaction like that? 

00:44:19.733 --> 00:44:25.500
What's the HOMO and LUMO of the
purple molecule here? 

00:44:25.500 --> 00:44:26.467
STUDENT: There doesn't seem to
be any. 

00:44:26.467 --> 00:44:28.667
PROFESSOR: There's no functional
group there. 

00:44:28.667 --> 00:44:30.367
How can you do it? 

00:44:30.367 --> 00:44:33.367
Well, tell me what would happen
first, if you have a 

00:44:33.367 --> 00:44:36.667
sulfuric acid and react with
this mixture. 

00:44:36.667 --> 00:44:39.933
What you think would happen
first? 

00:44:42.833 --> 00:44:45.733
Where is there a functional
group? 

00:44:45.733 --> 00:44:47.067
STUDENT: 	The pi. 

00:44:47.067 --> 00:44:48.033
PROFESSOR: The pi bond. 

00:44:48.033 --> 00:44:51.700
So proton would attack the pi
electrons. 

00:44:51.700 --> 00:44:53.433
And which end would it attack? 

00:44:53.433 --> 00:44:56.233
Would you put the proton here,
or would you put the proton on 

00:44:56.233 --> 00:44:58.100
the more substituted carbon? 

00:44:58.100 --> 00:44:59.533
STUDENT: It would be
Markovnikov. 

00:44:59.533 --> 00:45:01.100
PROFESSOR: It would be
Markovnikov. You'd want to get 

00:45:01.100 --> 00:45:02.900
a t-butyl cation. 

00:45:02.900 --> 00:45:04.567
OK, so we'll do that. 

00:45:04.567 --> 00:45:07.467
And incidentally, this product
was not irrelevant, 

00:45:07.467 --> 00:45:11.233
because that's what they mean
when they say octane. 

00:45:11.233 --> 00:45:15.067
That compound is defined as 100
octane, for the engine 

00:45:15.067 --> 00:45:16.100
performance. 

00:45:16.100 --> 00:45:19.600
So this was being worked on,
during the Second World War, 

00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:24.000
to try to make high-quality fuel
for airplanes. 

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:27.433
OK, so we'll follow what Noelle
says, and 

00:45:27.433 --> 00:45:29.333
make the t-butyl cation. 

00:45:29.333 --> 00:45:31.967
And now the t-butyl cation can
react with the 

00:45:31.967 --> 00:45:34.600
alkene, to give this. 

00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:37.933
And now you'd say, why don't we
just keep going? 

00:45:37.933 --> 00:45:41.700
Well, it depends on what the
situation is, and you'll see 

00:45:41.700 --> 00:45:43.067
it can do that. 

00:45:43.067 --> 00:45:46.233
But another thing it could do is
react with this. 

00:45:46.233 --> 00:45:48.400
Watch this. 

00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:51.133
This is a tertiary cation. 

00:45:51.133 --> 00:45:54.567
But it's rather hindered. 

00:45:54.567 --> 00:45:58.233
This one, if you transfer this
with its electrons, curved 

00:45:58.233 --> 00:46:03.000
arrow there, that's a hydride
shift. 

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:05.533
We've seen hydride shifts
before. 

00:46:05.533 --> 00:46:07.967
The difference is this is
happening between two 

00:46:07.967 --> 00:46:10.733
molecules, rather than for one
carbon to the next in the 

00:46:10.733 --> 00:46:12.233
same molecule. 

00:46:12.233 --> 00:46:15.900
But it was shown by Bartlett in
1944 that this process 

00:46:15.900 --> 00:46:18.700
happens, using isotopic labels.

00:46:18.700 --> 00:46:21.733
So it gives isooctane, and
what's the other product? 

00:46:21.733 --> 00:46:24.267
What's the purple product? 

00:46:24.267 --> 00:46:25.233
The H went-- 

00:46:25.233 --> 00:46:28.533
the hydride, not proton,
hydride, the H with its 

00:46:28.533 --> 00:46:29.900
electrons went up here. 

00:46:29.900 --> 00:46:32.567
What was left behind? 

00:46:32.567 --> 00:46:34.833
The t-butyl cation. 

00:46:34.833 --> 00:46:36.000
But that's what you need here. 

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:38.533
So this is a chain, it can go
round and round. 

00:46:38.533 --> 00:46:40.867
So you add isobutane to
isobutylene. 

00:46:43.433 --> 00:46:50.533
Now, if you don't have the
isobutane there, then it turns 

00:46:50.533 --> 00:46:54.700
out that it could do this
polymerization, add another 

00:46:54.700 --> 00:46:57.367
one and another one, et cetera,
et cetera. 

00:46:57.367 --> 00:46:59.933
And that gives polyisobutylene,
which is 

00:46:59.933 --> 00:47:01.667
called butyl rubber. 

00:47:01.667 --> 00:47:05.100
And it's not a very strong
material, but it has the 

00:47:05.100 --> 00:47:07.633
virtue of being airtight. 

00:47:07.633 --> 00:47:10.567
So that's what's made to seal
tires. 

00:47:10.567 --> 00:47:12.900
When they made inner tubes in
those days, they were made out 

00:47:12.900 --> 00:47:17.733
of butyl rubber, to hold the air
in. 

00:47:17.733 --> 00:47:21.633
OK, so now these electrophiles
in terpene and steroid 

00:47:21.633 --> 00:47:22.867
biogenesis. 

00:47:25.067 --> 00:47:29.433
Now I'm going to get on to this
next time, but since I 

00:47:29.433 --> 00:47:31.767
brought stuff here, I'm going to
entertain you 

00:47:31.767 --> 00:47:33.400
with show-and-tell. 

00:47:33.400 --> 00:47:35.933
It comes after this set of
slides. 

00:47:35.933 --> 00:47:39.600
But since I've got it here, I'm
going to do it. 

00:47:44.567 --> 00:47:46.300
So we'll turn on the light here.

00:47:46.300 --> 00:47:53.700
And what I have here, is water
and vinegar, dilute acetic 

00:47:53.700 --> 00:47:57.467
acid, and this stuff that I
bought down at the art supply 

00:47:57.467 --> 00:47:59.667
store called mold builder. 

00:47:59.667 --> 00:48:05.033
But if I read here, it says,
it's ammonia, 100% natural 

00:48:05.033 --> 00:48:07.233
latex, that means it came right
out of 

00:48:07.233 --> 00:48:08.967
the tree, and water. 

00:48:08.967 --> 00:48:15.167
So all that's in there is tree
sap, and water, and ammonia. 

00:48:15.167 --> 00:48:17.333
So I'm going to pour some into
the water here. 

00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:24.367
I'm going to take my jacket off
and 

00:48:24.367 --> 00:48:27.533
tuck my tie in actually. 

00:48:27.533 --> 00:48:29.367
I think that might be prudent. 

00:48:33.900 --> 00:48:35.333
OK. 

00:48:35.333 --> 00:48:38.633
So we're going to open it up
here, and we'll 

00:48:38.633 --> 00:48:39.867
pour some in there. 

00:48:48.267 --> 00:48:51.633
OK, now the ammonia keeps the
molecules-- 

00:48:51.633 --> 00:48:53.367
we'll talk about this next time
-- 

00:48:53.367 --> 00:48:55.700
apart from one another of this
latex. 

00:49:04.533 --> 00:49:06.967
But if we add some vinegar,
it'll get rid of the ammonia. 

00:49:18.867 --> 00:49:22.033
Obviously I didn't measure it
very carefully. 

00:49:22.033 --> 00:49:25.467
Oh, there, we're doing it. 

00:49:25.467 --> 00:49:27.167
So now the molecules are coming
together. 

00:49:30.800 --> 00:50:01.300
So if I reach in here and grab
it, get rid of that water, dry 

00:50:01.300 --> 00:50:02.533
it a few times here. 

00:50:22.067 --> 00:50:23.400
So we've made a rubber ball. 

00:50:30.200 --> 00:50:30.600
Good. 

00:50:30.600 --> 00:50:32.467
OK, if anybody wants to make a
rubber ball, you 

00:50:32.467 --> 00:50:33.433
can come and do it. 

00:50:33.433 --> 00:50:36.433
Thank you.

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.428
This lecture will be a some
slightly shorter lecture than

00:00:17.428 --> 00:00:19.443
usual.
What I first want to do is

00:00:19.443 --> 00:00:22.825
finish off the discussion of
clinical psychology from last

00:00:22.825 --> 00:00:26.505
lecture and then have a little
brief discussion about some very

00:00:26.505 --> 00:00:28.820
interesting research on
happiness.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.223
We talked--we ended last
lecture with a discussion of

00:00:32.223 --> 00:00:36.217
some early--some of the history
of treating mental illness and

00:00:36.217 --> 00:00:38.770
we saw that it was rather
gruesome,

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.256
unsuccessful, and arbitrary.
For the most part,

00:00:42.256 --> 00:00:43.838
we do better now,
and Dr.

00:00:43.838 --> 00:00:47.662
Nolen-Hoeksema reviewed some of
the therapies with focus on

00:00:47.662 --> 00:00:51.791
therapies for depression.
The textbook talks in detail

00:00:51.791 --> 00:00:55.479
about therapies for different
disorders including

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:57.937
schizophrenia,
anxiety disorders,

00:00:57.937 --> 00:01:01.220
and so on.
The question which everyone is

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.990
interested in is,
"Does therapy work?"

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:08.430
And this proves to be
surprisingly difficult to tell.

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.322
Part of the problem is if you
ask people who go into therapy,

00:01:13.322 --> 00:01:16.340
"Did you get better after
therapy?"

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.216
for the most part they'll tell
you that they did but the

00:01:20.216 --> 00:01:24.232
problem is this could be a
statistical byproduct of what's

00:01:24.232 --> 00:01:29.629
called "regression to the mean."
So, the idea looks like this.

00:01:29.629 --> 00:01:33.696
This line plots how you feel
from great through okay to awful

00:01:33.696 --> 00:01:37.626
and it goes up and down and in
fact in everyday life you're

00:01:37.626 --> 00:01:40.879
going to--some days are going to
be average,

00:01:40.879 --> 00:01:43.481
some days will be better than
average, some days worse than

00:01:43.481 --> 00:01:45.720
average.
You could plot your semester.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.483
You could do a plot every
morning when you wake up or

00:01:47.483 --> 00:01:48.670
every night before you go to
bed.

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.821
You could put yourself on a
graph and it'll come out to some

00:01:52.821 --> 00:01:55.483
sort of wiggly thing.
Statistically,

00:01:55.483 --> 00:01:59.879
if something is above average
or below average it's going to

00:01:59.879 --> 00:02:03.904
trend towards average just
because that's a statistical

00:02:03.904 --> 00:02:07.239
inevitability.
When do people go to therapy?

00:02:07.239 --> 00:02:10.250
Well, they go to therapy when
they're feeling really crappy.

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.550
They go to therapy when they're
feeling unusually bad.

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.542
Even if therapy then has no
effect at all,

00:02:16.542 --> 00:02:20.483
if it's true that people's
moods tend to go up and down

00:02:20.483 --> 00:02:25.154
after you feel really bad you'll
probably improve rather than get

00:02:25.154 --> 00:02:28.110
worse.
And so this could happen--the

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.487
normal flow could happen just
even if therapy has no effect at

00:02:32.487 --> 00:02:34.460
all.
And so, simply getting better

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:36.539
after therapy doesn't tell you
anything.

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:40.707
On the worst day of your life
you could do naked jumping jacks

00:02:40.707 --> 00:02:43.849
on the roof of your college for
ten minutes.

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:47.110
I guarantee you your next day
would probably be better.

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.120
That doesn't mean naked jumping
jacks are helping you.

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.809
Rather, it just means that the
day after the worst day of your

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:55.410
life usually is not as bad as
the worst day of your life.

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.588
It can get worse,
but usually it just trends to

00:02:58.588 --> 00:03:01.552
average.
What you've got to do then is

00:03:01.552 --> 00:03:05.783
you have to take people at the
same point who would get

00:03:05.783 --> 00:03:10.484
treatment and compare them to
people who do not get treatment

00:03:10.484 --> 00:03:13.540
or what we call a "control
group."

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.561
And this is an example of this.
So, this is for people who are

00:03:17.561 --> 00:03:19.890
depressed.
This is statistically equal.

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.612
They start off pre-therapy.
They all go for therapy but

00:03:23.612 --> 00:03:28.689
because in this example there's
a limited number of therapists,

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:31.177
some of them are put on a
waiting list and others get a

00:03:31.177 --> 00:03:33.360
therapist.
It's arbitrary.

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.474
It's random,
which is--which--making it a

00:03:35.474 --> 00:03:38.033
very good experiment.
And in this example,

00:03:38.033 --> 00:03:41.729
you could see those who
received cognitive training were

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:44.258
better off.
They had lower depression

00:03:44.258 --> 00:03:47.500
scores than those that received
no therapy at all.

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.148
In general, in fact,
we could make some general

00:03:51.148 --> 00:03:57.000
conclusions about therapy.
Therapy by and large works.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.415
People in treatment do better
than those who are not in

00:04:00.415 --> 00:04:04.274
treatment and that's not merely
because they choose to go into

00:04:04.274 --> 00:04:08.025
treatment.
Rather, it's people who are in

00:04:08.025 --> 00:04:11.560
desperate straits who seek out
help.

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.509
Those who get help are likely
to be better off than those that

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:18.750
don't get help.
Therapy for the most part works.

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:24.705
We can't cure a lot of things
but we can often make them

00:04:24.705 --> 00:04:27.353
better.
Different sorts of therapy

00:04:27.353 --> 00:04:30.186
works best for different
problems, and again,

00:04:30.186 --> 00:04:33.470
depression proves to be an
illustrative example.

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:36.797
If you have everyday unipolar
depression, that is,

00:04:36.797 --> 00:04:40.871
you feel very sad and you show
other symptoms associated with

00:04:40.871 --> 00:04:43.954
depression,
an excellent treatment for you

00:04:43.954 --> 00:04:48.288
is some combination of cognitive
behavioral therapy and possibly

00:04:48.288 --> 00:04:51.110
antidepressant medications like
SSRIs.

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:55.347
If you have bipolar depression,
the cognitive behavioral

00:04:55.347 --> 00:04:59.431
therapy is useless but
medication is your best bet and

00:04:59.431 --> 00:05:02.589
so on for all of the other
disorders.

00:05:02.589 --> 00:05:07.699
Each disorder has some sort of
optimal mode of treatment.

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:10.846
If you suffer from an anxiety
disorder, cognitive behavioral

00:05:10.846 --> 00:05:13.762
therapy can be of help.
If you're a schizophrenic it's

00:05:13.762 --> 00:05:16.189
probably not going to be of much
help at all.

00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:20.183
And so, different disorders go
best with different sorts of

00:05:20.183 --> 00:05:23.957
therapies.
Finally, some therapists do

00:05:23.957 --> 00:05:27.437
better than others.
So, for reasons that nobody

00:05:27.437 --> 00:05:29.696
fully understands,
there are good therapists and

00:05:29.696 --> 00:05:32.819
then there are better therapists
and there are bad therapists.

00:05:32.819 --> 00:05:37.197
And there's great individual
differences in the efficacy of

00:05:37.197 --> 00:05:41.807
an individual therapist.
Finally, putting aside then the

00:05:41.807 --> 00:05:46.590
difference in therapies and the
difference in therapists,

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:50.860
does it make sense to say that
therapy, in general,

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:53.899
works?
And the answer is "yes."

00:05:53.899 --> 00:05:57.171
And this is in large part
because of what clinical

00:05:57.171 --> 00:06:00.509
psychologists describe as
"nonspecific factors."

00:06:00.509 --> 00:06:04.396
And what this just is a term
meaning properties that all

00:06:04.396 --> 00:06:08.565
therapies, or virtually all
therapies, share and I've listed

00:06:08.565 --> 00:06:11.819
two of them here.
One of them is "support."

00:06:11.819 --> 00:06:15.670
No matter what sort of therapy
you're getting involved in,

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:18.980
be it a psychoanalyst or a
behavior therapist or a

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:22.695
cognitive therapist or a
psychiatrist who prescribes you

00:06:22.695 --> 00:06:26.410
medication or someone who makes
you go through different

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:31.091
exercises or keeps a journal,
you have some sense of support,

00:06:31.091 --> 00:06:33.835
some acceptance,
empathy, encouragement,

00:06:33.835 --> 00:06:37.040
guidance.
You have a human touch.

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:40.339
You have somebody who for at
least some of the day really

00:06:40.339 --> 00:06:44.051
cares about you and wants you to
be better and that could make a

00:06:44.051 --> 00:06:49.129
huge difference.
Also you have hope.

00:06:49.129 --> 00:06:54.370
Typically, there's an
enthusiasm behind therapy.

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:57.676
There's a sense that this might
really make me get better and

00:06:57.676 --> 00:07:01.064
that hope could be powerful.
Sometimes this is viewed under

00:07:01.064 --> 00:07:04.185
the rubric of a placebo effect,
which is that maybe the

00:07:04.185 --> 00:07:07.306
benefits you get from therapy
aren't due to anything in

00:07:07.306 --> 00:07:10.774
particular the therapist does to
you but rather to the belief

00:07:10.774 --> 00:07:13.259
that things are going to get
better,

00:07:13.259 --> 00:07:16.149
something is being done that
will help you.

00:07:16.149 --> 00:07:20.579
And this belief can be a
self-fulfilling prophecy.

00:07:20.579 --> 00:07:24.930
"Placebo effect" is often used
sort of in a dismissive way,

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:29.206
"Oh, it's just a placebo,"
but placebos can be powerful

00:07:29.206 --> 00:07:34.104
and even if it's useless from a
real point--from a psychological

00:07:34.104 --> 00:07:37.606
theory point of view,
even if the therapist runs

00:07:37.606 --> 00:07:41.381
around and dances while you –
I have dancing on my mind now

00:07:41.381 --> 00:07:44.779
– while you sit in the chair
and watch him dance;

00:07:44.779 --> 00:07:48.145
if you believe the dancing is
going to make you better,

00:07:48.145 --> 00:07:50.360
it may well help.
Okay.

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:52.020
That's all I'm going to say
about therapy.

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:57.529
Any questions about therapy?
Yes.

00:07:57.529 --> 00:08:22.056
Student: [inaudible]
Professor Paul Bloom:

00:08:22.056 --> 00:08:30.328
Fair enough.
The question is the assumption

00:08:30.328 --> 00:08:34.317
of regression to the mean seems
sort of arbitrary because it

00:08:34.317 --> 00:08:37.600
depends what the mean is.
Always after the fact you can

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:39.470
apply an average to it and say,
"Look.

00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:42.280
This is the average," but how
do you know beforehand?

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:46.820
It's a good point.
When you talk about regression

00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:50.120
to the mean, it adopts certain
assumptions.

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:54.204
The assumption is there really
is an average throughout much of

00:08:54.204 --> 00:08:58.289
your life and things go up and
down within that average and for

00:08:58.289 --> 00:09:01.649
the most part that's true for
things like mood.

00:09:01.649 --> 00:09:04.539
For most of us,
we have an average mood and we

00:09:04.539 --> 00:09:06.980
have bad days and we have good
days.

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:10.505
It's always possible that you
have a bad day and then from

00:09:10.505 --> 00:09:14.154
there on in it's just going to
go down and down and down but

00:09:14.154 --> 00:09:18.050
statistically the best bet is if
you have a bad day you're going

00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:22.934
to go back up to the mean.
It's--in some way you don't

00:09:22.934 --> 00:09:28.420
even have to see it from a
clinical point of view.

00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:32.880
You could map it out yourself.
Map out your moods and the days

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:37.183
where you're most depressed
sooner or later you're likely to

00:09:37.183 --> 00:09:40.451
go up.
Similarly, on the happiest day

00:09:40.451 --> 00:09:45.761
of your life odds are the next
day you're going to go down and

00:09:45.761 --> 00:09:49.070
there's nothing magical about
this.

00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:52.433
This is just because under the
assumption that there really is

00:09:52.433 --> 00:09:54.860
an average in--built into
one--each of us.

00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:57.717
If human behavior was
arbitrary, it would be like a

00:09:57.717 --> 00:10:00.862
random walk but it's not.
We seem to have sort of set

00:10:00.862 --> 00:10:04.600
points and aspects of us that we
fall back to that make the idea

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:07.390
of a mean a psychologically
plausible claim.

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:16.617
Yes.
Student: [inaudible]

00:10:16.617 --> 00:10:22.070
Professor Paul Bloom:
That's a good question.

00:10:22.070 --> 00:10:25.117
Yes.
In that study it's a perfectly

00:10:25.117 --> 00:10:28.479
good hypothesis that the sort of
anxiety of being told,

00:10:28.479 --> 00:10:30.720
"I see you've come here for
help.

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:33.370
We can't give it to you.
Congratulations.

00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:36.398
You're a control group"
[laughs]

00:10:36.398 --> 00:10:39.725
causes anxiety.
In other studies the control

00:10:39.725 --> 00:10:42.519
group doesn't know they are the
control group.

00:10:42.519 --> 00:10:45.965
So sometimes you can do an
intervention where you say,

00:10:45.965 --> 00:10:48.889
"Congratulations,
everybody in Intro Psych who

00:10:48.889 --> 00:10:51.879
did very low on the depression
inventory,"

00:10:51.879 --> 00:10:54.969
which many of you filled out,
"We're going to do something to

00:10:54.969 --> 00:10:56.796
you."
And then the rest of the people

00:10:56.796 --> 00:10:59.020
don't even know that they
haven't been chosen.

00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:01.990
So, you're right.
It's a perfectly good point.

00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:05.185
Knowing you're not chosen could
have a deleterious effect and

00:11:05.185 --> 00:11:08.168
the way to respond to that is
you have other studies that

00:11:08.168 --> 00:11:09.820
don't use that same method.

00:11:16.810 --> 00:11:23.813
Okay.
I want to end with happiness

00:11:23.813 --> 00:11:28.450
and it's a strange thing to talk
about in psychology.

00:11:28.450 --> 00:11:32.475
Most of psychology focuses on
human misery,

00:11:32.475 --> 00:11:36.912
most of clinical psychology.
There is the psychology we

00:11:36.912 --> 00:11:40.637
spoke about through most of the
semester on vision and language

00:11:40.637 --> 00:11:43.998
and social behavior,
but typically when people think

00:11:43.998 --> 00:11:47.635
about interventions what they
think about is people having

00:11:47.635 --> 00:11:51.399
problems and then we figure out
how to make them better.

00:11:51.399 --> 00:11:54.137
They are schizophrenic,
they are depressed or anxious,

00:11:54.137 --> 00:11:56.100
they are just not making it in
life,

00:11:56.100 --> 00:12:00.350
and psychologists try to figure
out how to make things improve.

00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:03.200
And in fact,
a lot of the information I gave

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:06.714
you at the beginning of the
lecture last class where I

00:12:06.714 --> 00:12:10.759
reviewed all of the disorders is
in this wonderful book called

00:12:10.759 --> 00:12:13.559
DSM-IV,
The Diagnostic and Statistical

00:12:13.559 --> 00:12:16.865
Manual of Mental Disorders.
If you ever really want to

00:12:16.865 --> 00:12:19.996
get--If you really [laughs]
want to diagnose people and

00:12:19.996 --> 00:12:23.360
come to have a belief in your
own mental instability,

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:26.169
browsing through that book is a
treat.

00:12:26.169 --> 00:12:31.033
Everything that can go wrong in
mental life from Aspergers

00:12:31.033 --> 00:12:36.152
syndrome to fetishes to paranoid
schizophrenia is all in that

00:12:36.152 --> 00:12:40.844
wonderful book and--but a lot of
psychologists have been

00:12:40.844 --> 00:12:46.220
disturbed by the focus of our
field on taking bad people,

00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:48.497
people who are broken,
people who are sad,

00:12:48.497 --> 00:12:52.733
and bringing them up to normal.
And they've started to ask can

00:12:52.733 --> 00:12:57.139
psychology give us any insight
into human flourishing,

00:12:57.139 --> 00:13:00.080
how to take people who
are--who--how to study people

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:04.014
who are psychological successes,
how to take people who are

00:13:04.014 --> 00:13:07.279
psychologically okay and make
them better.

00:13:07.279 --> 00:13:11.450
And this is the movement known
as "positive psychology."

00:13:11.450 --> 00:13:15.287
And it has its own handbook
now, The Handbook of Positive

00:13:15.287 --> 00:13:18.539
Psychology, listing
psychological strengths,

00:13:18.539 --> 00:13:22.697
listing virtues,
ways--what psychology tells us

00:13:22.697 --> 00:13:29.120
about how we can be at our best.
Some of this work in positive

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:33.509
psychology is,
in my mind, real crap.

00:13:33.509 --> 00:13:37.969
A lot of it is some combination
of new age banalities by people

00:13:37.969 --> 00:13:41.781
who are striving to get more
grant funds and end up on

00:13:41.781 --> 00:13:44.985
Time magazine.
On the other hand--and so,

00:13:44.985 --> 00:13:48.427
some of it is really bad.
You could imagine this attracts

00:13:48.427 --> 00:13:51.320
every self-help huckster you
could imagine.

00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:54.262
On the other hand,
a lot of this work is quite

00:13:54.262 --> 00:13:57.269
neat, quite interesting and
quite promising.

00:13:57.269 --> 00:14:00.533
And what I want to do is tell
you what I think is the most

00:14:00.533 --> 00:14:04.139
interesting research from this
movement concerning happiness.

00:14:04.139 --> 00:14:07.214
Now, there are a lot of good
books on this and I'm going to

00:14:07.214 --> 00:14:09.705
recommend books,
which I haven't been doing much

00:14:09.705 --> 00:14:12.652
in this class.
Marty Seligman is the pioneer

00:14:12.652 --> 00:14:16.982
of positive psychology and he's
written an excellent book called

00:14:16.982 --> 00:14:20.830
Authentic Happiness.
Jonathan Haidt is a brilliant

00:14:20.830 --> 00:14:24.885
young scholar who's done--also
done a lot of work on disgust

00:14:24.885 --> 00:14:28.320
and morality.
He did the "sex with dead

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:31.370
chicken study" we discussed
earlier.

00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:34.492
This is one of my favorite
books by – Happiness by

00:14:34.492 --> 00:14:37.453
Nettle, because it's smart,
it's beautifully written and

00:14:37.453 --> 00:14:40.117
it's extremely short.
And Dan Gilbert's book,

00:14:40.117 --> 00:14:43.554
Stumbling on Happiness,
is a very, very funny book and

00:14:43.554 --> 00:14:46.647
very smart book and is now on
The New York Times

00:14:46.647 --> 00:14:49.692
bestseller list.
So, there's no shortage of

00:14:49.692 --> 00:14:53.245
books on happiness.
So, the starting point is--And

00:14:53.245 --> 00:14:57.445
a lot of research on happiness
starts with a basic question:

00:14:57.445 --> 00:15:01.936
How happy are you?
And we're psychologists so tell

00:15:01.936 --> 00:15:06.673
us on a scale of one to ten
where five is average,

00:15:06.673 --> 00:15:10.308
ten is super-duper.
The most common answers,

00:15:10.308 --> 00:15:12.320
interestingly enough,
are high.

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:15.766
They're seven or eight.
How many people in this room

00:15:15.766 --> 00:15:18.540
would give themselves a seven or
an eight?

00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:20.790
Okay.
How many a nine or a ten?

00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:25.309
All right.
How many a ten?

00:15:25.309 --> 00:15:27.409
Good, good, maxed out on
happiness.

00:15:27.409 --> 00:15:32.259
It turns out that most people
think that they're pretty happy.

00:15:32.259 --> 00:15:34.379
There's a Lake Wobegon effect
with happiness.

00:15:34.379 --> 00:15:35.649
Most people think they're very
happy.

00:15:35.649 --> 00:15:38.457
In fact, most people think
they're happier than most

00:15:38.457 --> 00:15:40.659
people, which shouldn't really
happen.

00:15:40.659 --> 00:15:45.957
This question,
"How happy are you from one to

00:15:45.957 --> 00:15:48.967
ten?"
has been asked all over the

00:15:48.967 --> 00:15:51.762
world.
So--and it turns out there are

00:15:51.762 --> 00:15:55.409
slight differences depending on
how old you are.

00:15:55.409 --> 00:16:00.314
There are slight differences
depending on your place within a

00:16:00.314 --> 00:16:03.419
country, California versus New
York.

00:16:03.419 --> 00:16:06.276
There are slight,
subtle differences between men

00:16:06.276 --> 00:16:09.679
and women at different points,
somewhat paradoxically.

00:16:09.679 --> 00:16:14.225
Although women are more
vulnerable to depression than

00:16:14.225 --> 00:16:19.470
men, still on average women are
slightly happier than men.

00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:22.429
The country-by-country data is
quite interesting.

00:16:22.429 --> 00:16:24.700
In one study they looked at
forty-two countries.

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:28.963
The happiest--well, let me see.
The happiest people on

00:16:28.963 --> 00:16:31.850
earth--well, first,
no country believed they were

00:16:31.850 --> 00:16:34.917
unhappy, the people in no
country of these forty-two

00:16:34.917 --> 00:16:37.139
countries.
I mean, you're thinking there

00:16:37.139 --> 00:16:40.052
are some really bad countries to
live in and I don't know if they

00:16:40.052 --> 00:16:42.600
were tested but of these
forty-two everybody seemed--said

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:45.450
they were above average.
The happiest people on earth?

00:16:45.450 --> 00:16:48.991
The Swiss.
[laughter]

00:16:48.991 --> 00:16:51.590
They think--they're just
like--they're just so happy.

00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:55.137
I was talking to people about
this last night and they

00:16:55.137 --> 00:16:57.268
suggested chocolate.
[laughter]

00:16:57.268 --> 00:17:00.100
The saddest people on this--on
the sample?

00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:03.889
The sad Bulgarians.
[laughter]

00:17:03.889 --> 00:17:07.009
You are wondering what about
Americans.

00:17:07.009 --> 00:17:10.690
Americans are actually pretty
happy, 7.71.

00:17:10.690 --> 00:17:15.200
We are a happy country full of
happy people.

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:19.002
Now, I'm going to talk about a
lot of research that's based on

00:17:19.002 --> 00:17:22.804
the data you get when you ask
people how happy they are from a

00:17:22.804 --> 00:17:26.958
scale of one to ten.
But I'm going to be honest and

00:17:26.958 --> 00:17:32.539
tell you there are reasons to be
cautious about these numbers.

00:17:32.539 --> 00:17:37.079
And the reasons come from a
couple of experiments.

00:17:37.079 --> 00:17:40.592
In one experiment they asked
people inside a psychology

00:17:40.592 --> 00:17:43.779
department where there was a
photocopy machine.

00:17:43.779 --> 00:17:46.215
They went up to people--the
people were going up to the

00:17:46.215 --> 00:17:49.012
photocopy machine to make copies
and when they were done making

00:17:49.012 --> 00:17:51.836
copies they asked them,
"How happy are you with your

00:17:51.836 --> 00:17:54.519
entire life?"
There were two groups.

00:17:54.519 --> 00:17:57.461
Group A, they put a dime on top
of the photocopy machine so

00:17:57.461 --> 00:18:00.200
people walked over there,
"I'm going to [inaudible].

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:02.110
Oh, a dime.
Well."

00:18:02.110 --> 00:18:08.100
The other group, no dime.
It turned out that when asked

00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:10.777
"How good is your whole life?"
[laughter]

00:18:10.777 --> 00:18:15.079
group A reported [laughter]
greater life satisfaction

00:18:15.079 --> 00:18:19.985
overall in their entire lives.
Another study asked people how

00:18:19.985 --> 00:18:24.191
happy you are with your whole
life on sunny days like today

00:18:24.191 --> 00:18:28.324
and people said they were
happier on sunny days than rainy

00:18:28.324 --> 00:18:31.237
days.
What's interesting is you could

00:18:31.237 --> 00:18:35.471
make this effect go away if you
ask immediately before "How's

00:18:35.471 --> 00:18:37.819
the weather?"
These were done by phone

00:18:37.819 --> 00:18:39.828
interviews.
And logically,

00:18:39.828 --> 00:18:46.119
what seems to go on is that if
you're asked how's the weather,

00:18:46.119 --> 00:18:48.732
you're "Oh, it's really sunny
outside," and then when people

00:18:48.732 --> 00:18:51.080
are asked "How happy are you
with your whole life?"

00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:54.734
people then say, "Oh, okay.
I'm going to take into account

00:18:54.734 --> 00:18:57.210
the sunny-ness when I give my
answer.

00:18:57.210 --> 00:19:02.069
Okay.
So, what is happiness?

00:19:02.069 --> 00:19:06.328
What are people rating when
they're answering these sort of

00:19:06.328 --> 00:19:09.199
questions?
And this is an extraordinarily

00:19:09.199 --> 00:19:13.312
difficult question and one could
devote a seminar to discussing

00:19:13.312 --> 00:19:15.375
it,
but one simple answer from an

00:19:15.375 --> 00:19:18.649
evolutionary point of view is
that happiness--forget about

00:19:18.649 --> 00:19:21.670
"what is happiness?"
Ask "what's happiness for?"

00:19:21.670 --> 00:19:23.837
just like we've asked what
language is for,

00:19:23.837 --> 00:19:26.780
or what laughter is for,
or what hunger or lust is for.

00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:30.021
What's happiness for?
And one answer is happiness is

00:19:30.021 --> 00:19:32.789
a goal state that we've evolved
to pursue.

00:19:32.789 --> 00:19:35.359
It's a signal that our needs
have been satisfied.

00:19:35.359 --> 00:19:39.301
Happiness is the carrot we're
running towards that makes us

00:19:39.301 --> 00:19:42.570
take care of our lives.
We want to be happy.

00:19:42.570 --> 00:19:47.808
An example of this is food.
You're not very happy if you're

00:19:47.808 --> 00:19:49.943
starving.
You want to be satiated,

00:19:49.943 --> 00:19:52.843
you want to be satisfied,
so you seek out food to fill

00:19:52.843 --> 00:19:55.198
your belly.
Once you've done it,

00:19:55.198 --> 00:19:58.884
you're happy.
Steven Pinker summarizes the

00:19:58.884 --> 00:20:03.204
keys to happiness in a nicely
evocative passage:

00:20:03.204 --> 00:20:06.789
"We are happier when we are
healthy,

00:20:06.789 --> 00:20:09.061
well-fed, comfortable,
safe, prosperous,

00:20:09.061 --> 00:20:11.450
knowledgeable,
respected, non-celibate,

00:20:11.450 --> 00:20:15.131
in love."
How many people here have got

00:20:15.131 --> 00:20:18.670
all of those right now?
Oh, come on.

00:20:18.670 --> 00:20:20.635
[laughter] Some people.
Oddly enough,

00:20:20.635 --> 00:20:23.425
the person who said he was a
ten didn't--does not raise his

00:20:23.425 --> 00:20:25.490
hand.
Okay.

00:20:25.490 --> 00:20:27.744
[laughter]
So this is- And this makes

00:20:27.744 --> 00:20:30.250
out--you get all your needs
satisfied,

00:20:30.250 --> 00:20:33.710
your belly is full,
people love you,

00:20:33.710 --> 00:20:38.160
you're getting sex regularly,
you're smart,

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:40.629
you're rich,
you're happy,

00:20:40.629 --> 00:20:45.370
but as Pinker points out it's
not that simple.

00:20:45.370 --> 00:20:47.340
Here's the problem.

00:20:50.869 --> 00:20:56.345
You, Americans in this century,
you are now healthier,

00:20:56.345 --> 00:21:02.233
better fed and so on than just
about anyone in history but

00:21:02.233 --> 00:21:06.170
you're not happier.
That's the puzzle.

00:21:06.170 --> 00:21:09.379
In particular,
these studies asking about

00:21:09.379 --> 00:21:12.990
happiness have been around for a
long time.

00:21:12.990 --> 00:21:17.457
People in the 1950s did not
make as much money,

00:21:17.457 --> 00:21:21.730
did not eat as well,
did not live as long,

00:21:21.730 --> 00:21:24.930
suffered from more diseases,
were more vulnerable in a

00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:28.860
hundred different ways,
yet they were--are as happy as

00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:31.256
you are now.
You are as happy as your

00:21:31.256 --> 00:21:34.509
parents were and they were as
happy as your grandparents.

00:21:34.509 --> 00:21:41.631
Moreover, in poor countries
people don't have the shelter,

00:21:41.631 --> 00:21:45.630
the knowledge,
the protection,

00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:48.046
the safety, yet,
for the most part,

00:21:48.046 --> 00:21:52.098
there's not a huge effect on
how rich a country is and--on

00:21:52.098 --> 00:21:55.204
how happy the people are.
Furthermore,

00:21:55.204 --> 00:22:00.077
there are great individual
differences in happiness among

00:22:00.077 --> 00:22:03.210
people whose basic needs are
met.

00:22:03.210 --> 00:22:06.806
For the most part,
everybody in this room is fed

00:22:06.806 --> 00:22:10.153
and sheltered and safe.
Some of you are prosperous,

00:22:10.153 --> 00:22:13.019
some of you are knowledgeable,
a couple non-celibate,

00:22:13.019 --> 00:22:16.815
and-- [laughter]
but even among that group you

00:22:16.815 --> 00:22:21.369
vary in your happiness,
and that's kind of a puzzle.

00:22:21.369 --> 00:22:25.406
And to explain the puzzle we
need to talk about a few

00:22:25.406 --> 00:22:30.529
surprising facts about happiness
and I'll present three of them.

00:22:30.529 --> 00:22:36.599
The first is happiness doesn't
change as much as you think.

00:22:36.599 --> 00:22:40.129
In particular,
happiness is not as sensitive

00:22:40.129 --> 00:22:44.890
to what happens--your happiness
is not as sensitive to what

00:22:44.890 --> 00:22:49.570
happens in your environment as
you might think it is.

00:22:54.470 --> 00:22:58.419
Part of the reason for this is
that there appears to be a

00:22:58.419 --> 00:23:01.170
strong heritable basis for
happiness.

00:23:01.170 --> 00:23:04.537
So, just as we talked about the
domains of personality and

00:23:04.537 --> 00:23:06.546
intelligence,
there is some genetic

00:23:06.546 --> 00:23:09.289
determination,
not entirely but some,

00:23:09.289 --> 00:23:13.162
in how happy you are.
And some people talk in terms

00:23:13.162 --> 00:23:16.109
of a genetically determined set
point.

00:23:16.109 --> 00:23:20.494
So, you have a sort of natural
happiness level,

00:23:20.494 --> 00:23:23.828
maybe a range.
To put it in extreme form,

00:23:23.828 --> 00:23:27.793
some people are genetically
predisposed to be pretty sour,

00:23:27.793 --> 00:23:30.020
others to be pretty cheerful.

00:23:33.270 --> 00:23:36.743
Well, that can't be it.
Identical twins are very

00:23:36.743 --> 00:23:40.029
similar in their happiness but,
as with everything else we've

00:23:40.029 --> 00:23:42.000
discussed, they're not
identical.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.095
What about life events?
Wouldn't life events change

00:23:45.095 --> 00:23:47.589
your happiness?
And here we're entering one of

00:23:47.589 --> 00:23:50.110
the great discoveries of
happiness research.

00:23:50.110 --> 00:23:53.942
Think for a moment.
What's the worst thing that

00:23:53.942 --> 00:24:00.395
could happen to you?
And then ask how much would it

00:24:00.395 --> 00:24:05.779
change your happiness.
Now, think for a moment.

00:24:05.779 --> 00:24:08.599
What's the best thing that
could happen to you?

00:24:08.599 --> 00:24:14.240
And ask how much would it
change your happiness.

00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:20.691
And the research in happiness
suggests that your gut feelings

00:24:20.691 --> 00:24:24.337
are probably wrong.
And here's a couple of case

00:24:24.337 --> 00:24:26.807
studies.
For many people a very bad

00:24:26.807 --> 00:24:31.594
thing that could happen to you
is to be paralyzed from the neck

00:24:31.594 --> 00:24:35.355
down in an accident.
It turns out obviously,

00:24:35.355 --> 00:24:39.154
common sense,
that when this happens it makes

00:24:39.154 --> 00:24:43.189
people very unhappy.
It makes them depressed,

00:24:43.189 --> 00:24:47.715
they think their life is over,
they feel terribly sad,

00:24:47.715 --> 00:24:52.426
but not for that long.
After about a year after being

00:24:52.426 --> 00:24:57.408
paralyzed from the neck down,
people's happiness comes back

00:24:57.408 --> 00:25:00.930
up pretty much to where it was
before,

00:25:00.930 --> 00:25:05.032
suggesting that there's a
temporary effect but not a

00:25:05.032 --> 00:25:08.191
permanent one.
Many people believe that

00:25:08.191 --> 00:25:11.621
winning many,
many millions of dollars in the

00:25:11.621 --> 00:25:15.130
lottery will make you happier
and it does.

00:25:15.130 --> 00:25:17.408
When you open up that winning
ticket and you say,

00:25:17.408 --> 00:25:19.497
"I won one hundred million
dollars," you say,

00:25:19.497 --> 00:25:21.683
"Woo, hoo!"
You are honest to God very

00:25:21.683 --> 00:25:23.432
happy.
You'd say, "Hell,

00:25:23.432 --> 00:25:29.067
I'm a 10.5, I am very happy."
A year later you are not as

00:25:29.067 --> 00:25:31.465
happy.
In fact, lottery winning may be

00:25:31.465 --> 00:25:33.774
a terrible case where
people--where it goes the

00:25:33.774 --> 00:25:36.713
reverse of what you expect.
What happens when you win a lot

00:25:36.713 --> 00:25:39.349
of money is it often wrenches
you away from your family,

00:25:39.349 --> 00:25:43.076
your work and your friends and
leads you to depression and

00:25:43.076 --> 00:25:47.129
sadness but even mundane events
that would make you happy--that

00:25:47.129 --> 00:25:50.660
you think would make you happy
don't seem to last.

00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:55.494
In some research by Dan Gilbert
and others, they've asked young

00:25:55.494 --> 00:25:59.549
assistant professors who are
coming up for tenure,

00:25:59.549 --> 00:26:02.575
and tenure in a university
system is a good thing to get

00:26:02.575 --> 00:26:05.049
because it gives you lifetime
job security,

00:26:05.049 --> 00:26:09.299
"How happy would you feel if
you got tenure?

00:26:09.299 --> 00:26:11.980
How happy would you feel if you
didn't get tenure?"

00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:16.773
Prior to the last election,
they asked people "How happy

00:26:16.773 --> 00:26:20.259
would you be if it was President
Bush?

00:26:20.259 --> 00:26:23.339
How happy would you be if it
was President Kerry?"

00:26:23.339 --> 00:26:27.839
And it turns out people
radically overestimated the

00:26:27.839 --> 00:26:32.166
effects of these things.
Having your favorite candidate

00:26:32.166 --> 00:26:35.424
win is not such a big deal.
Having your favorite candidate

00:26:35.424 --> 00:26:37.109
lose is not such a big deal
either.

00:26:37.109 --> 00:26:39.677
Getting tenure or not getting
tenure are really big when it

00:26:39.677 --> 00:26:41.929
happens.
Six months later and a year

00:26:41.929 --> 00:26:45.279
later your happiness doesn't
seem to be affected.

00:26:45.279 --> 00:26:48.257
The purchase of consumer goods,
an Xbox 360,

00:26:48.257 --> 00:26:51.857
a nice flat screen TV,
those sorts of things make you

00:26:51.857 --> 00:26:56.081
very happy when you open up the
package and set it up but this

00:26:56.081 --> 00:26:58.920
happiness fades almost
immediately.

00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:00.769
The moral of--A lot of people
are shaking their heads.

00:27:00.769 --> 00:27:06.409
It's true, not for me but--the
moral of a lot of this work is

00:27:06.409 --> 00:27:11.766
we think these things will have
big permanent and profound

00:27:11.766 --> 00:27:16.560
effects but they need not and
they often don't.

00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:20.225
Why not?
Why do we overestimate their

00:27:20.225 --> 00:27:22.882
happiness?
And the technical term for

00:27:22.882 --> 00:27:26.000
this, by the way,
is "affective forecasting."

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:29.958
Again, this is Dan Gilbert's
work and the idea is we are bad

00:27:29.958 --> 00:27:33.340
at affective forecasting.
That is, we are bad at

00:27:33.340 --> 00:27:37.623
predicting how happy or sad we
will be in the future based on

00:27:37.623 --> 00:27:42.130
what's happening to us.
Why?

00:27:42.130 --> 00:27:44.974
Well, a couple of reasons.
One thing is there's often a

00:27:44.974 --> 00:27:47.750
failure to appreciate the
day-to-day irrelevance of

00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:51.065
certain events.
So prior to the election--the

00:27:51.065 --> 00:27:55.457
election's happening tomorrow
and I ask somebody who's a

00:27:55.457 --> 00:27:58.971
diehard Democrat,
"How would you feel if Bush

00:27:58.971 --> 00:28:00.720
won?"
and the person said,

00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:03.776
"I'll be miserable.
It'll be a miserable four years

00:28:03.776 --> 00:28:06.135
afterwards."
But what often isn't

00:28:06.135 --> 00:28:10.711
appreciated here is that whether
or not Bush wins will make you

00:28:10.711 --> 00:28:14.622
sad or happy after it happens
but for the most of your

00:28:14.622 --> 00:28:18.902
day-to-day life you aren't
thinking about who the president

00:28:18.902 --> 00:28:22.081
is.
I'd be very happy if I won a

00:28:22.081 --> 00:28:27.400
huge prize and I'd be "Whoa,
a huge prize," the Nobel prize,

00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:29.668
a Guggenheim,
a MacArthur ‘Genius' or I get

00:28:29.668 --> 00:28:32.900
them all in the same day.
[laughter] "What a day.

00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:36.699
I am really happy."
But then a month later I'm

00:28:36.699 --> 00:28:40.612
there and I've still got my
regular insomnia and there's

00:28:40.612 --> 00:28:44.809
nothing on TV and the plumber's
not coming and my kids don't

00:28:44.809 --> 00:28:48.579
respect me and I can't--and the
fact that "Yeah,

00:28:48.579 --> 00:28:51.750
but I won the prize," it
doesn't matter.

00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:55.005
A lot of the things in life
that'll make you really--that

00:28:55.005 --> 00:28:58.610
you think will make you really
happy don't have this day-to-day

00:28:58.610 --> 00:29:02.785
effect.
Also, there is the logic of the

00:29:02.785 --> 00:29:06.069
set point.
And this comes to a terrible

00:29:06.069 --> 00:29:10.716
word: We adapt.
Right now I'm a guy without a

00:29:10.716 --> 00:29:13.779
Nobel prize.
I'm kind of used to it.

00:29:13.779 --> 00:29:17.089
If I got a Nobel prize I'd be a
guy with a Nobel prize.

00:29:17.089 --> 00:29:21.039
I'd be happy but then I'd kind
of get used to that too.

00:29:21.039 --> 00:29:22.950
And if I got a second one,
"whoa, two!"

00:29:22.950 --> 00:29:25.960
but then I'd just get used to
that too.

00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:29.619
You get used to things.
You get used to bad things.

00:29:29.619 --> 00:29:32.720
Now, I don't want to overstate
this.

00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:35.089
There are some very interesting
exceptions.

00:29:35.089 --> 00:29:43.549
So for instance,
we don't get used to noise.

00:29:43.549 --> 00:29:47.411
A lot of research suggests that
if your environment is noisy,

00:29:47.411 --> 00:29:51.016
they're doing construction
around you, you can't get used

00:29:51.016 --> 00:29:53.544
to it.
Your happiness drops and it

00:29:53.544 --> 00:29:57.708
doesn't come back up.
Your system cannot habituate to

00:29:57.708 --> 00:30:01.871
continued noise.
We adapt to good things,

00:30:01.871 --> 00:30:05.954
winning the lottery,
winning a prize,

00:30:05.954 --> 00:30:11.663
getting an "A " in a course.
We adapt, we get used to it,

00:30:11.663 --> 00:30:14.640
also with some surprising
exceptions.

00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:18.182
One of the big--one of the
other surprises from happiness

00:30:18.182 --> 00:30:21.599
research is the effects of
cosmetic surgery like breast

00:30:21.599 --> 00:30:23.940
enhancement and breast
reduction.

00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:28.958
One of the big surprises is it
makes people happier and then

00:30:28.958 --> 00:30:33.069
they stay happier.
And one explanation for this is

00:30:33.069 --> 00:30:36.737
how we look is very important.
It's very important for how

00:30:36.737 --> 00:30:38.785
other people see us and how we
see ourselves,

00:30:38.785 --> 00:30:41.299
and you never get used to
looking in a certain way.

00:30:41.299 --> 00:30:44.829
So, if you look better it just
makes you happier all the time.

00:30:44.829 --> 00:30:49.676
So, there are these exceptions
but putting aside the

00:30:49.676 --> 00:30:54.998
exceptions, the problem of
adaptation is sometimes called

00:30:54.998 --> 00:31:00.890
"the hedonic treadmill" and the
idea is hedonic for happy.

00:31:00.890 --> 00:31:05.838
You keep on running but no
matter how fast you run you stay

00:31:05.838 --> 00:31:08.910
where you are,
you get used to it.

00:31:08.910 --> 00:31:12.042
Habituation is like you
put--you step into a very hot

00:31:12.042 --> 00:31:14.971
bath but you get used to it.
If it's a cold bath you get

00:31:14.971 --> 00:31:16.906
used to it.
A difficult environment,

00:31:16.906 --> 00:31:19.359
an easy environment,
you get used to it.

00:31:19.359 --> 00:31:23.083
The story is often
illustrated--It's often

00:31:23.083 --> 00:31:28.442
illustrated with a story from
the Bible in Ecclesiastes of a

00:31:28.442 --> 00:31:32.877
king and this king had it all.
He had gardens,

00:31:32.877 --> 00:31:37.098
parks, vineyards,
castles, slaves and concubines

00:31:37.098 --> 00:31:41.500
and they were both male and
female concubines.

00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:43.971
[laughter]
So, he had everything,

00:31:43.971 --> 00:31:48.529
right, but it didn't make him
happy and here's what he says:

00:31:48.529 --> 00:31:52.191
"I hated life.
All this vanity and a chasing

00:31:52.191 --> 00:31:56.970
after wind and there is nothing
to be gained under the sun."

00:31:56.970 --> 00:32:00.801
Now, in these books I talked
about at the beginning these

00:32:00.801 --> 00:32:05.180
authors give advice on how to
deal with the hedonic treadmill.

00:32:05.180 --> 00:32:09.588
How do you deal with the fact
that everything you aspire to,

00:32:09.588 --> 00:32:13.772
once you get it you'll be used
to it and it will lose its

00:32:13.772 --> 00:32:16.858
value?
Well, one answer is that

00:32:16.858 --> 00:32:20.950
possessions are not the key to
happiness.

00:32:20.950 --> 00:32:25.130
Possessions you very quickly
get used to.

00:32:25.130 --> 00:32:29.110
From there, there are two
alternatives.

00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:32.328
One is endless novelty.
So one guy – I forget his

00:32:32.328 --> 00:32:34.100
name – wrote a book and he
says, "Look.

00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:36.883
There's the hedonic treadmill.
The trick is always do

00:32:36.883 --> 00:32:39.495
something different.
Next week have sex with

00:32:39.495 --> 00:32:41.520
somebody you've never had sex
before.

00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:44.771
Then climb Mount Everest.
You get bored with that,

00:32:44.771 --> 00:32:46.760
become an accountant.
Boring.

00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:48.700
Scuba diving.
Boring."

00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:53.059
He had endless ideas,
and that's a possibility.

00:32:53.059 --> 00:32:56.349
You never--you--if you keep
changing what you're doing

00:32:56.349 --> 00:32:59.639
you'll never get used to
anything and you'll always be

00:32:59.639 --> 00:33:02.180
happy.
At least he says that.

00:33:02.180 --> 00:33:04.300
Then there's the old guy
alternative.

00:33:04.300 --> 00:33:08.739
Step off the treadmill.
Give up--give up chasing the

00:33:08.739 --> 00:33:12.964
whole happiness thing and then
seek out more substantial goods

00:33:12.964 --> 00:33:17.259
that might actually not make you
happy in the simple sense of a

00:33:17.259 --> 00:33:21.354
quick fix of delight,
but substantial goods like

00:33:21.354 --> 00:33:25.150
friends and family and long-term
projects.

00:33:25.150 --> 00:33:30.915
So, the first moral of the
science of happiness is that

00:33:30.915 --> 00:33:35.400
your happiness is actually
rather fixed.

00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:38.638
It's fixed in part genetically
and it's fixed in part because

00:33:38.638 --> 00:33:42.200
what happens in your life you'll
get used to, to a large extent.

00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:43.940
Are you raising your hand?
No.

00:33:43.940 --> 00:33:53.257
Oh, sorry.
The second one is happiness is

00:33:53.257 --> 00:33:57.772
relative.
So, there's a lot of research

00:33:57.772 --> 00:34:01.947
on money, power and happiness,
and remember I did say before

00:34:01.947 --> 00:34:06.264
that it doesn't matter whether
you come from a rich country or

00:34:06.264 --> 00:34:09.059
a poor country.
As long as your country--as

00:34:09.059 --> 00:34:12.226
long as you're not starving to
death, it kind of doesn't matter

00:34:12.226 --> 00:34:14.780
how rich your country is for how
happy you are.

00:34:14.780 --> 00:34:18.140
But that's not the same as
saying it doesn't matter how

00:34:18.140 --> 00:34:22.329
much money you make.
In fact, there's a set point or

00:34:22.329 --> 00:34:27.969
a range but there is some effect
on your salary and on your job

00:34:27.969 --> 00:34:31.919
on your happiness.
And if you're desperately poor,

00:34:31.919 --> 00:34:35.274
no matter where you are,
no matter who's around you,

00:34:35.274 --> 00:34:40.053
you're not going to be happy.
But beyond that your happiness

00:34:40.053 --> 00:34:43.530
depends on your relative
circumstance.

00:34:43.530 --> 00:34:46.011
And this is an old insight.
H.L.

00:34:46.011 --> 00:34:49.516
Mencken wrote,
"A wealthy man is one who earns

00:34:49.516 --> 00:34:54.190
a hundred dollars more than his
wife's sister's husband."

00:34:54.190 --> 00:34:57.389
The idea is what matters isn't
how much you make.

00:34:57.389 --> 00:35:00.204
What matters is how much you
make relative to the people

00:35:00.204 --> 00:35:02.510
around you.
And they've asked people this.

00:35:02.510 --> 00:35:05.232
"What would you rather?
Do you want to make seventy

00:35:05.232 --> 00:35:08.095
thousand dollars if everybody
else in your office is making

00:35:08.095 --> 00:35:10.760
sixty-five thousand or
seventy-five thousand dollars if

00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:13.079
everybody else is making eighty
thousand?"

00:35:13.079 --> 00:35:16.952
Does it matter how much money
you bring home or does it matter

00:35:16.952 --> 00:35:20.190
how much money you make relative
to other people?

00:35:20.190 --> 00:35:28.316
Well, they're both factors but
relative salary--and in this

00:35:28.316 --> 00:35:34.316
example people prefer this.
They prefer to be making less

00:35:34.316 --> 00:35:37.789
if they're making more than the
people around them.

00:35:37.789 --> 00:35:41.717
It turns out that there's
research on British social

00:35:41.717 --> 00:35:46.569
servants and their happiness and
their health and the quality of

00:35:46.569 --> 00:35:51.421
their relationships and how they
love their lives doesn't depend

00:35:51.421 --> 00:35:55.545
on how much money they make.
It depends on where they are

00:35:55.545 --> 00:35:59.380
relative to everybody else.
We are very status conscious

00:35:59.380 --> 00:36:03.959
primates and your role in a
hierarchy, your level in the

00:36:03.959 --> 00:36:08.621
hierarchy plays a--has a
significant effect on your level

00:36:08.621 --> 00:36:12.559
of happiness.
This is not really a secret.

00:36:12.559 --> 00:36:17.615
The opera star Maria Callas and
the English professor Stanley

00:36:17.615 --> 00:36:21.070
Fish had the same negotiating
strategy.

00:36:21.070 --> 00:36:25.185
When Fish got hired into his
department, according to urban

00:36:25.185 --> 00:36:28.449
legend at least,
he said, "I don't want to talk

00:36:28.449 --> 00:36:30.297
salary.
I don't have a particular

00:36:30.297 --> 00:36:32.405
number in mind.
I just want to get paid one

00:36:32.405 --> 00:36:35.204
hundred dollars more than
whoever is the top person in

00:36:35.204 --> 00:36:39.156
this department."
And that's a guy who knows

00:36:39.156 --> 00:36:42.450
about happiness.
He walks in and he states,

00:36:42.450 --> 00:36:44.390
"I'm paid more than everybody
else.

00:36:44.390 --> 00:36:48.050
I don't care how much it is.
It's just more."

00:36:48.050 --> 00:36:50.231
[laughter]
And that's relevant to

00:36:50.231 --> 00:36:53.744
happiness.
We're now in a position to give

00:36:53.744 --> 00:36:56.960
some advice to the king,
summing up.

00:36:56.960 --> 00:37:00.824
First, going back again to Dr.
Nolen-Hoeksema's lecture,

00:37:00.824 --> 00:37:05.111
I think the king is suffering
from mild unipolar depression so

00:37:05.111 --> 00:37:09.116
we should--he should get some
SSRIs and cognitive behavior

00:37:09.116 --> 00:37:12.502
therapy.
I think he needs to move his

00:37:12.502 --> 00:37:15.849
castle to a quiet part of the
kingdom.

00:37:15.849 --> 00:37:20.829
The noise of a busy castle is
stressful.

00:37:20.829 --> 00:37:26.650
And he needs to give up on the
concubines.

00:37:26.650 --> 00:37:29.938
He needs to find a queen.
He needs to develop social

00:37:29.938 --> 00:37:31.847
relationships,
join a club,

00:37:31.847 --> 00:37:34.929
get involved in charity,
maybe a hobby.

00:37:34.929 --> 00:37:41.723
The final finding is a bit of a
jump to a different topic

00:37:41.723 --> 00:37:44.969
but--sorry.
You raised--yes.

00:37:44.969 --> 00:37:50.726
Student: [inaudible]
Professor Paul Bloom:

00:37:50.726 --> 00:37:55.017
The question is,
"Would you become used to

00:37:55.017 --> 00:38:00.185
changes of social interaction?"
An example is solitary

00:38:00.185 --> 00:38:03.588
confinement or prison.
People get used to a lot of

00:38:03.588 --> 00:38:05.569
things.
It could be that in those

00:38:05.569 --> 00:38:08.620
examples there is a shift in
status as well and social

00:38:08.620 --> 00:38:12.131
relationships and how you think
of yourself relative to others

00:38:12.131 --> 00:38:14.780
so that may be difficult to
recover from.

00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:19.166
If you're popular at Yale and
you go to prison you're not

00:38:19.166 --> 00:38:23.161
going to be very happy your
first few days in prison

00:38:23.161 --> 00:38:25.776
probably.
But then suppose you get

00:38:25.776 --> 00:38:28.037
popular in prison,
people like you,

00:38:28.037 --> 00:38:31.429
you're the head of the book
club and everything.

00:38:31.429 --> 00:38:33.841
[laughter]
You'd rather not be in

00:38:33.841 --> 00:38:38.136
prison--been in prison but
you'll probably be a pretty--if

00:38:38.136 --> 00:38:42.130
you're a cheerful guy here
you'll be a cheerful guy in

00:38:42.130 --> 00:38:45.809
prison.
The final case is--involves

00:38:45.809 --> 00:38:50.909
judgments of the pleasure and
pain of past events.

00:38:50.909 --> 00:38:54.502
And I mentioned the Nobel prize
a little while ago as an example

00:38:54.502 --> 00:38:57.924
but the work I'm going to talk
about is actually from the one

00:38:57.924 --> 00:39:01.460
psychologist who's alive who's
won the Nobel prize--sorry,

00:39:01.460 --> 00:39:05.639
one of the ones who's won the
Nobel prize, Daniel Kahneman.

00:39:05.639 --> 00:39:09.150
And he became interested in
happiness.

00:39:09.150 --> 00:39:12.590
And you remember him from his
rationality research and this is

00:39:12.590 --> 00:39:15.940
some work on happiness.
Here's an example.

00:39:15.940 --> 00:39:18.489
Anybody see the movie
Marathon Man?

00:39:18.489 --> 00:39:22.260
It involves a dental torture
scene.

00:39:22.260 --> 00:39:28.354
Imagine you're going to the
dentist and he's torturing you

00:39:28.354 --> 00:39:33.700
or it's a cleaning but it's
really painful and it's

00:39:33.700 --> 00:39:36.062
terrible.
You're sweaty,

00:39:36.062 --> 00:39:39.880
you're squeezing the thing,
and it lasts for an hour and

00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:43.421
then when it's done the dentist
leans over and says,

00:39:43.421 --> 00:39:47.179
"We're done now.
If you want we could stop.

00:39:47.179 --> 00:39:50.264
But if you want,
as a favor to you – I have

00:39:50.264 --> 00:39:54.469
five minutes – I could top you
off with some mild pain."

00:39:54.469 --> 00:39:58.360
This may seem like a very odd
thing to ask.

00:39:58.360 --> 00:40:01.119
Here's the alternative.
What do you want?

00:40:01.119 --> 00:40:06.375
A dental procedure that's very
painful for an hour or a dental

00:40:06.375 --> 00:40:11.630
procedure that's very painful
for an hour--sorry about the "S"

00:40:11.630 --> 00:40:15.680
there --and then some additional
mild pain?

00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:18.690
Who votes for A?
You got to choose one.

00:40:18.690 --> 00:40:21.900
Who votes for A?
Okay.

00:40:21.900 --> 00:40:24.790
Who votes for B?
Okay.

00:40:24.790 --> 00:40:30.914
Here's the big finding.
The big finding is "yes," B

00:40:30.914 --> 00:40:34.060
involves more pain.
It's true.

00:40:34.060 --> 00:40:39.019
"A" is an hour of pain.
"B" is an hour of pain plus a

00:40:39.019 --> 00:40:44.194
few minutes of more pain.
Seems like a no-brainer but

00:40:44.194 --> 00:40:49.721
when you have A or B and you
have to remember it later on

00:40:49.721 --> 00:40:54.360
you'll have a much nicer memory
of B than A.

00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:58.842
Kahneman's insight is when you
think back on events you don't

00:40:58.842 --> 00:41:02.204
just add up the amount of
pleasure or pain you

00:41:02.204 --> 00:41:05.996
experienced.
Rather, your memory is highly

00:41:05.996 --> 00:41:09.310
skewed to peaks and then to
endings.

00:41:09.310 --> 00:41:13.033
And you could imagine this.
In the first case,

00:41:13.033 --> 00:41:16.430
"A," you leave and say,
"Oh, God, that was terrible.

00:41:16.430 --> 00:41:18.588
Oh."
"B," you leave and say,

00:41:18.588 --> 00:41:22.062
"Oh, that was mildly painful.
There was something terrible in

00:41:22.062 --> 00:41:24.900
the middle there but it ended
okay, mild pain."

00:41:24.900 --> 00:41:27.970
It turns out,
in general, endings matter a

00:41:27.970 --> 00:41:30.273
lot.
Kahneman did his research with

00:41:30.273 --> 00:41:33.980
– both in a laboratory where
you could make – give people

00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:37.440
mild pain by getting them to
stick their hand in freezing

00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:40.776
cold water and with people
undergoing extremely painful

00:41:40.776 --> 00:41:44.547
colonoscopy procedures.
And it turns out that if you

00:41:44.547 --> 00:41:48.449
want to give people a good
memory, or a less bad memory,

00:41:48.449 --> 00:41:53.436
of a horrible event topping
them off with some mild pain

00:41:53.436 --> 00:41:58.429
will do the trick.
In the end, endings matter.

00:41:58.429 --> 00:42:02.372
Both of these examples,
a party that's hugely fun for

00:42:02.372 --> 00:42:05.405
ninety percent,
then the last ten percent

00:42:05.405 --> 00:42:09.423
somebody slaps you in the face
and pours dip on you or

00:42:09.423 --> 00:42:11.849
something-- [laughter]
So,

00:42:11.849 --> 00:42:15.499
ninety percent of good stuff,
ten percent bad stuff,

00:42:15.499 --> 00:42:19.792
versus ninety percent people
are slapping you and pouring dip

00:42:19.792 --> 00:42:22.869
on you [laughter]
but then ten percent,

00:42:22.869 --> 00:42:26.210
whoa, that was a really
good--when you think back on it,

00:42:26.210 --> 00:42:31.137
if you just added it up,
"A" would be much better but

00:42:31.137 --> 00:42:38.309
"B" has this huge pull because
of the power of how things end

00:42:38.309 --> 00:42:43.780
so endings matter.
So, I'm going to end things now.

00:42:43.780 --> 00:42:45.219
I'm first going to do a few
things.

00:42:45.219 --> 00:42:48.809
Before saying anything more,
I want to thank the teaching

00:42:48.809 --> 00:42:50.612
fellows.
There's Sunny Bang,

00:42:50.612 --> 00:42:52.264
Erik Cheries,
Jane Erickson,

00:42:52.264 --> 00:42:55.140
Izzat Jarudi,
Greg Laun, and Koleen McCrink.

00:42:55.140 --> 00:43:02.173
I think they did a superb job.
[applause]

00:43:02.173 --> 00:43:10.469
We've basically reviewed all
the psychology.

00:43:10.469 --> 00:43:14.591
Here is a promissory note we
started with at the beginning of

00:43:14.591 --> 00:43:17.873
this semester.
I think you are now in a

00:43:17.873 --> 00:43:23.150
position to answer or at least
consider answers about these

00:43:23.150 --> 00:43:25.930
topics,
about topics such as dreams,

00:43:25.930 --> 00:43:28.468
testimony, disgust,
memory, depression,

00:43:28.468 --> 00:43:31.578
language,
humor, and even a little bit

00:43:31.578 --> 00:43:35.396
about good and evil.
This is an--a broad intro

00:43:35.396 --> 00:43:38.985
survey class,
and the field of psychology is

00:43:38.985 --> 00:43:42.239
broad and we've just gotten
started.

00:43:42.239 --> 00:43:46.510
If you're interested,
this is a great department.

00:43:46.510 --> 00:43:50.350
There are some amazing scholars
here and some amazing teachers

00:43:50.350 --> 00:43:53.938
and there are courses that go
into detail about just about

00:43:53.938 --> 00:43:58.070
every topic I talked about.
If you're interested in memory

00:43:58.070 --> 00:44:02.431
or social interaction or mental
illness, I could point you to

00:44:02.431 --> 00:44:05.618
some great courses.
I'm not taking any sophomore

00:44:05.618 --> 00:44:08.909
advisees next year because I'm
on leave in the fall but you

00:44:08.909 --> 00:44:12.257
should feel free to come talk to
me if you want any specific

00:44:12.257 --> 00:44:16.057
advice or suggestions.
Now, I know not all of you are

00:44:16.057 --> 00:44:19.079
going to end up majoring in
psychology.

00:44:19.079 --> 00:44:22.550
Some of you will choose
cognitive science instead

00:44:22.550 --> 00:44:25.297
[laughter]
but on a more serious note I

00:44:25.297 --> 00:44:29.706
know for some of you this is the
last--maybe the first but the

00:44:29.706 --> 00:44:32.960
last psychology class you'll
ever take.

00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:36.574
And so I want to close this
course by emphasizing two

00:44:36.574 --> 00:44:40.250
themes.
The first one is a bit of

00:44:40.250 --> 00:44:42.827
humility.
There are some very basic

00:44:42.827 --> 00:44:46.140
questions about the mind – and
I've tried to be honest about

00:44:46.140 --> 00:44:48.639
this throughout the
course--There are some very

00:44:48.639 --> 00:44:51.952
basic questions about the mind
that nobody knows the answer to

00:44:51.952 --> 00:44:54.417
yet.
We know the brain is the source

00:44:54.417 --> 00:44:58.153
of mental life but we don't have
any understanding at all about

00:44:58.153 --> 00:45:01.725
exactly how this happens,
about how a physical object,

00:45:01.725 --> 00:45:04.487
a lump of meat,
can give rise to conscious

00:45:04.487 --> 00:45:07.132
experience.
We know that about half of the

00:45:07.132 --> 00:45:09.968
variants in personality,
about half the differences

00:45:09.968 --> 00:45:12.769
between people,
are due to genetic factors but

00:45:12.769 --> 00:45:16.269
we don't know how to explain
where the other half happens.

00:45:16.269 --> 00:45:20.235
It has to be experienced but we
have no real good theories of

00:45:20.235 --> 00:45:24.135
the sort of experience that
makes one person adventurous and

00:45:24.135 --> 00:45:28.679
another one timid,
one bitter and one satisfied.

00:45:28.679 --> 00:45:32.565
We know a lot about the social
influences that can drive people

00:45:32.565 --> 00:45:36.137
to do terrible things to one
another but we don't know the

00:45:36.137 --> 00:45:39.772
answer to the maybe harder
question of why some of us--some

00:45:39.772 --> 00:45:42.530
people are immune to these
influences,

00:45:42.530 --> 00:45:46.355
why some people do good things,
perhaps even heroic things,

00:45:46.355 --> 00:45:50.510
regardless of the circumstances
that they find themselves in.

00:45:50.510 --> 00:45:53.159
So, there's an enormous amount
left to do.

00:45:53.159 --> 00:45:57.095
It's an exciting field just
because there's just so much

00:45:57.095 --> 00:46:01.176
more we need to understand.
The second theme is more

00:46:01.176 --> 00:46:03.994
optimistic.
And this is the idea that we're

00:46:03.994 --> 00:46:07.390
going to eventually come to
answer these questions and many

00:46:07.390 --> 00:46:11.137
more questions through the sorts
of methods we've been discussing

00:46:11.137 --> 00:46:14.396
this semester,
through constructing scientific

00:46:14.396 --> 00:46:16.681
theories,
evolution--evolutionary,

00:46:16.681 --> 00:46:18.769
neurological,
developmental,

00:46:18.769 --> 00:46:22.550
computational and testing them
through experimental and

00:46:22.550 --> 00:46:25.687
observational methods.
This is the idea that,

00:46:25.687 --> 00:46:29.030
in the end, the most important
and intimate aspects of

00:46:29.030 --> 00:46:31.244
ourselves,
our beliefs and emotions,

00:46:31.244 --> 00:46:34.033
our capacities to make
decisions, even our sense of

00:46:34.033 --> 00:46:37.603
right and wrong can be explained
through constructing and testing

00:46:37.603 --> 00:46:40.329
scientific hypotheses.
Now, the reason why I'm

00:46:40.329 --> 00:46:43.511
optimistic is I think there's
been some success stories where

00:46:43.511 --> 00:46:46.587
we really have learned some
surprising and important things

00:46:46.587 --> 00:46:49.609
about the mind and there's no
reason to expect this way of

00:46:49.609 --> 00:46:51.889
proceeding to fail us in the
future.

00:46:51.889 --> 00:46:56.046
In my very--in the very first
class on the brain I ended by

00:46:56.046 --> 00:46:58.769
talking about people's worries
here,

00:46:58.769 --> 00:47:02.326
and I'll be honest,
that some people find it a

00:47:02.326 --> 00:47:05.322
scary prospect.
Some people believe that a

00:47:05.322 --> 00:47:09.136
scientific approach to the mind
takes the "special-ness" away

00:47:09.136 --> 00:47:12.060
from people, that it diminishes
us somehow.

00:47:12.060 --> 00:47:16.755
And I don't agree.
If there's anything I've tried

00:47:16.755 --> 00:47:19.482
to persuade you through the
course, it's that the more you

00:47:19.482 --> 00:47:22.256
look at the mind and how it
works from a serious scientific

00:47:22.256 --> 00:47:25.510
point of view the more you come
to appreciate its complexities,

00:47:25.510 --> 00:47:29.449
uniqueness, and its beauty.
This has been a great course to

00:47:29.449 --> 00:47:32.965
teach.
Thank you for coming and good

00:47:32.965 --> 00:47:34.231
luck on the Final.

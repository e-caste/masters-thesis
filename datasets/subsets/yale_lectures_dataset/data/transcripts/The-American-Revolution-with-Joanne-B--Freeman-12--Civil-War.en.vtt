00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.956
Prof: So today we are
going to take the plunge

00:00:05.956 --> 00:00:08.915
[laughs]
into the actual outbreak of

00:00:08.915 --> 00:00:09.930
warfare.
 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:13.562
However, now that I've teased
you that way,

00:00:13.562 --> 00:00:18.320
I do actually want us to get to
declare independence.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:19.966
[laughs]
If you think about it,

00:00:19.966 --> 00:00:22.875
we didn't quite get there
yesterday so I do want us to

00:00:22.875 --> 00:00:25.510
declare independence for just a
few minutes.

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:29.263
We're going to close that off
and then we will move on to the

00:00:29.263 --> 00:00:32.891
opening of hostilities and the
logic behind them and really

00:00:32.891 --> 00:00:34.080
what they show.
 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:39.305
So thinking back to Tuesday,
Tuesday we ended with a

00:00:39.305 --> 00:00:44.838
discussion of the editing of the
completed draft of the

00:00:44.838 --> 00:00:48.063
Declaration,
and I mentioned that

00:00:48.063 --> 00:00:52.067
Jefferson's passage on slavery
was cut out of the final

00:00:52.067 --> 00:00:54.960
document for any number of
reasons,

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.800
one of them obviously being
that for Southerners,

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.730
that would have been a deal
breaker,

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.539
and also because there were all
sorts of inherent

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:04.349
inconsistencies in what
Jefferson had written.

00:01:04.349 --> 00:01:08.310
Now the editing process went on
for a few days only.

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.730
It wasn't longer than that.
 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.641
Actually, events are unfolding
pretty quickly here as far as

00:01:12.641 --> 00:01:15.060
drafting, editing,
passing, and moving on with the

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.640
Declaration of Independence.
 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.239
And Jefferson did not enjoy the
editing process.

00:01:21.239 --> 00:01:24.638
Jefferson hated the editing
process because he really

00:01:24.638 --> 00:01:27.971
thought they were completely
mangling his beautiful,

00:01:27.971 --> 00:01:29.280
wonderful prose.
 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.175
So supposedly he sat in the
corner of the room in the main

00:01:33.175 --> 00:01:36.730
chamber of the Congress looking
really miserable--

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:39.763
okay--just sort of cringing and
wincing every time they cut

00:01:39.763 --> 00:01:42.848
another one of his beautiful
words or substituted some other

00:01:42.848 --> 00:01:43.790
word in there.
 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.236
So apparently,
and we get this partly from

00:01:46.236 --> 00:01:49.560
Jefferson himself,
he looked so miserable that

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.390
Benjamin Franklin ended up going
over to him to try to cheer him

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:54.849
up.
 

00:01:54.849 --> 00:01:57.974
And I'm offering this partly
because I'm always trying

00:01:57.974 --> 00:02:00.864
obviously to get us past the
sort of 'oh, American

00:02:00.864 --> 00:02:02.810
Revolution, the Declaration.'
 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:03.281
Right?
 

00:02:03.281 --> 00:02:06.430
I'm trying to sort of make this
human--

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.030
right?--human documents,
human moments,

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.305
human struggling,
so we're now really going to

00:02:10.305 --> 00:02:12.479
humanize the Declaration of
Independence.

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:15.740
So Jefferson says--he's sitting
there.

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.568
Where are his words here?
 

00:02:17.568 --> 00:02:17.854
Okay.
 

00:02:17.854 --> 00:02:20.482
He said Franklin,
quote, "perceived that I

00:02:20.482 --> 00:02:23.280
was not insensible to these
mutilations."

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.579
Okay.
 

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:25.911
[laughs]
So Franklin saw that--according

00:02:25.911 --> 00:02:29.620
to Jefferson how much I hated
them mutilating my document,

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.688
and Franklin ends up telling
Jefferson a story,

00:02:32.688 --> 00:02:36.440
and then Jefferson,
kindly for us looking on,

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.281
preserved the story,
so I can offer you the story

00:02:39.281 --> 00:02:42.772
that Franklin told Jefferson
basically to distract him while

00:02:42.772 --> 00:02:45.970
they were editing the
Declaration of Independence.

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:51.430
So Franklin told this story of
a hatter named John Thompson,

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.215
and this hatter named John
Thompson wanted to open a shop

00:02:55.215 --> 00:02:59.000
and he wanted to create a sign
to hang over the door,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.878
and he planned on having the
sign say "John Thompson,

00:03:02.878 --> 00:03:05.532
Hatter, makes and sells hats
for ready money,"

00:03:05.532 --> 00:03:07.710
and then there'd be a picture
of a hat.

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:10.883
So that's his plan,
but he decides he'll run the

00:03:10.883 --> 00:03:14.530
sign by a few of his friends to
see what they think;

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.560
is that the right sign for him
to put up in front of his new

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.919
shop?
 

00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:20.550
So he goes to one friend and
the first friend says,

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:23.550
'Well, you don't really need
the word 'hatter,' do you?

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.432
Because obviously if you make
and sell hats,

00:03:26.432 --> 00:03:27.639
you're a hatter.
 

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:29.240
So you could just cut the word
'hatter.'

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.229
And the next one says, 'Makes?
 

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:33.129
Do you really have to say
'makes hats'?

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:34.810
Obviously, they're hats.
 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:36.479
You don't need the word 'makes.'
 

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:37.860
You can cut the word 'makes.'
 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:38.889
It's unneeded on the sign.'
 

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:42.080
Another says,
'Why say 'for ready money'?

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.348
What?
 

00:03:42.348 --> 00:03:44.288
You're going to give away the
hats?

00:03:44.288 --> 00:03:46.490
[laughter]
You can cut 'for ready money.'

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:48.000
And so obviously this goes on
and on.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.354
Franklin continues to tell this
anecdote until in the end the

00:03:51.354 --> 00:03:54.599
sign just says John Thompson and
has a picture of a hat.

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:55.900
[laughter] Okay.
 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.450
So Franklin tells this story
and then he says,

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:01.229
'The moral of the story--' He
even had a moral.

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:04.680
The moral of the story is that
Franklin made it--

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.120
tried, quote,
"whenever in my power,

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.473
to avoid becoming the
draughtsman of papers to be

00:04:10.473 --> 00:04:12.848
reviewed by a public body."
 

00:04:12.848 --> 00:04:13.128
Okay.
 

00:04:13.128 --> 00:04:16.264
Never write anything that a
public body will edit because

00:04:16.264 --> 00:04:19.959
you will be very sad and all of
your words will be sliced away.

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.547
So that's this little,
tiny human moment happening in

00:04:22.547 --> 00:04:25.432
the corner of the chamber where
the Continental Congress is

00:04:25.432 --> 00:04:26.028
meeting.
 

00:04:26.028 --> 00:04:29.360
Meanwhile, they're editing the
document.

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.100
On July 2,1776,
Congress votes for

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:34.800
independence.
 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.658
Two days later on July 4,
after all of the editing and

00:04:38.658 --> 00:04:42.446
Jeffersonian cringing,
Congress formally adopted the

00:04:42.446 --> 00:04:45.733
Declaration of Independence--
so we have declared

00:04:45.733 --> 00:04:48.509
independence,
we've adopted the Declaration

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:50.937
of Independence,
but obviously now something has

00:04:50.937 --> 00:04:54.021
to happen to the document,
and it wasn't intended to be

00:04:54.021 --> 00:04:56.920
something that was sort of filed
away.

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:00.216
It was intended obviously to
have an impact--and there were

00:05:00.216 --> 00:05:01.579
two audiences in mind.
 

00:05:01.579 --> 00:05:03.884
On the one hand,
people in the Congress did

00:05:03.884 --> 00:05:07.011
think that if they declared
their intentions and what they

00:05:07.011 --> 00:05:09.370
were doing in some sort of a
document,

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:12.980
that the outer world,
people beyond the colonies,

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:15.976
first of all would understand
what was going on and then

00:05:15.976 --> 00:05:18.209
hopefully might even want to
offer aid.

00:05:18.209 --> 00:05:18.482
Right?
 

00:05:18.482 --> 00:05:20.074
Any--Basically,
if they're declaring

00:05:20.074 --> 00:05:22.622
independence against Britain,
maybe people who don't like

00:05:22.622 --> 00:05:24.170
Britain will want to help us.
 

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:27.910
So first they're thinking:
possibly a European audience.

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:30.891
But even more important than
that, they're thinking about a

00:05:30.891 --> 00:05:31.920
domestic audience.
 

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:35.404
They're thinking about having
the American people not only

00:05:35.404 --> 00:05:39.136
understand what's happening but
really hear this document that

00:05:39.136 --> 00:05:41.459
they've tinkered every word
over,

00:05:41.459 --> 00:05:45.089
the Congress's feelings about
what they think is happening,

00:05:45.089 --> 00:05:47.269
what they believe is going on
in the colonies,

00:05:47.269 --> 00:05:49.259
what they are declaring to the
world.

00:05:49.259 --> 00:05:53.759
And so what happens basically
is once the document is passed,

00:05:53.759 --> 00:05:54.810
it's issued.
 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:57.319
The Congress sent it out to any
number of places.

00:05:57.319 --> 00:06:00.346
They sent it out to the
Continental Army,

00:06:00.346 --> 00:06:03.298
many copies,
so that it could be read to

00:06:03.298 --> 00:06:05.040
people in the army.
 

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:06.788
And the Continental Army comes
Tuesday, so don't think I forgot

00:06:06.788 --> 00:06:08.141
the Continental Army,
and George Washington comes

00:06:08.141 --> 00:06:08.480
Tuesday.
 

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:12.000
They sent it out to state
assemblies.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.430
They sent it out to committees
of safety.

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:17.809
Basically, they found any
number of avenues to send out

00:06:17.809 --> 00:06:20.562
this document so that it could
be read aloud,

00:06:20.562 --> 00:06:22.189
and that was the plan.
 

00:06:22.189 --> 00:06:25.156
It wasn't for people to sort of
read this interestingly in their

00:06:25.156 --> 00:06:27.389
newspaper,
but they actually had public

00:06:27.389 --> 00:06:29.528
readings of it on courthouse
steps,

00:06:29.528 --> 00:06:33.279
in public squares,
at public meetings,

00:06:33.279 --> 00:06:34.139
town meetings.
 

00:06:34.139 --> 00:06:36.709
It was sort of a performed
document.

00:06:36.709 --> 00:06:39.175
It was being read so people
could hear what

00:06:39.175 --> 00:06:42.230
independence--how independence
was being declared.

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:45.466
And in response,
there were all kinds of public

00:06:45.466 --> 00:06:47.930
celebrations and
demonstrations--

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:50.529
so there were fireworks,
there were parades,

00:06:50.529 --> 00:06:54.999
and there was a lot of symbolic
destruction of some of the

00:06:54.999 --> 00:06:56.959
trappings of the Crown.
 

00:06:56.959 --> 00:06:59.422
So basically,
images of the King--like,

00:06:59.422 --> 00:07:03.245
on a tavern sign--were ripped
down, were broken into pieces,

00:07:03.245 --> 00:07:05.060
were burned in bonfires.
 

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:07.863
In New York City--this--a
famous image of this,

00:07:07.863 --> 00:07:11.396
which you may have seen--they
pulled down a large statue of

00:07:11.396 --> 00:07:13.470
the King mounted on his horse.
 

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:16.827
They actually literally pulled
it down and then later had it

00:07:16.827 --> 00:07:19.160
melted into bullets for the war
effort.

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:21.480
So clearly--Boy,
isn't that a slap?

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:22.939
Yeah, I heard a noise over
there.

00:07:22.939 --> 00:07:23.374
That's true.
 

00:07:23.374 --> 00:07:24.860
This is "gugsch,"
King George.

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:28.778
Not only did we tear you down
but we're going to use you to

00:07:28.778 --> 00:07:31.209
shoot at you with your own
statue.

00:07:31.209 --> 00:07:36.420
So obviously independence is a
moment, is an event.

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:39.060
It's not just a document.
 

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:42.807
So--And I should note here too
that now that independence is

00:07:42.807 --> 00:07:46.021
declared,
what had been colonies are not

00:07:46.021 --> 00:07:48.759
colonies any longer,
right?--if they have declared

00:07:48.759 --> 00:07:50.735
independence and they're saying
they are no longer colonies of

00:07:50.735 --> 00:07:52.514
Great Britain--
I'm going to try to remember

00:07:52.514 --> 00:07:55.120
from here on out to begin to use
the word "state."

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:58.379
They're frantically--and I'll
talk more about this on Tuesday.

00:07:58.379 --> 00:08:01.449
They're frantically now also
worrying about state

00:08:01.449 --> 00:08:05.413
constitutions to replace where
the royal government had been in

00:08:05.413 --> 00:08:07.648
the past,
but now obviously we're not

00:08:07.648 --> 00:08:08.540
colonies anymore.
 

00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:12.879
We're moving on to another sort
of state of being and in their

00:08:12.879 --> 00:08:15.300
mind actually even another word.
 

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:20.319
But of course there's an
obvious looming question at

00:08:20.319 --> 00:08:21.009
hand.
 

00:08:21.009 --> 00:08:21.601
Right?
 

00:08:21.601 --> 00:08:25.644
Warfare, conflict,
hostility: Something is

00:08:25.644 --> 00:08:26.730
looming.
 

00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:32.096
And there's no clear path as to
how whatever's going to happen

00:08:32.096 --> 00:08:37.461
next is going to unfold or how
it should be played out or even

00:08:37.461 --> 00:08:42.388
just how these newly-declared
states are going to execute

00:08:42.388 --> 00:08:43.620
warfare.
 

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:46.129
How should they organize the
effort?

00:08:46.129 --> 00:08:47.600
How should this war be fought?
 

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:51.190
How might it possibly be won?
 

00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:51.585
Right?
 

00:08:51.585 --> 00:08:54.416
The idea of winning a war
against the power,

00:08:54.416 --> 00:08:57.510
the might of the British
army--to say the least,

00:08:57.510 --> 00:09:01.330
that would have been really
daunting to these people.

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:03.894
The odds would have felt
seemingly impossible,

00:09:03.894 --> 00:09:06.690
and then on top of that,
what about organizing?

00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:09.460
Whatever effort you were going
to take, what about organizing?

00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:10.610
How were you supposed to do
that?--

00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:13.330
particularly given that the
Continental Congress,

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:16.865
as we'll discuss next week,
didn't have any absolute power

00:09:16.865 --> 00:09:19.408
to really enforce much of what
it did,

00:09:19.408 --> 00:09:23.341
making it, as we'll see,
even more difficult for them to

00:09:23.341 --> 00:09:26.629
sort of organize and carry out a
war effort?

00:09:26.629 --> 00:09:29.830
So basically,
today and Tuesday I'm going to

00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:34.370
be talking about the process of
opening a war and organizing a

00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:36.485
war,
basically in the process

00:09:36.485 --> 00:09:39.558
showing something about the
mindset on both sides.

00:09:39.558 --> 00:09:41.649
And today particularly you're
going to get a sense,

00:09:41.649 --> 00:09:45.261
just by looking on ground level
at what's happening between

00:09:45.261 --> 00:09:47.679
British soldiers and --
I'm going to still say

00:09:47.679 --> 00:09:49.519
"colonists"
because it's in my head.

00:09:49.519 --> 00:09:51.398
We'll move on to Americans,
but I'm going

00:09:51.398 --> 00:09:53.370
to--"colonists"
is right here.

00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:54.090
I can't banish it yet.
 

00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:55.799
I'm feeling very colonial.
 

00:09:55.799 --> 00:09:57.389
It's my habit.
 

00:09:57.389 --> 00:09:58.940
It's my British tradition.
 

00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:01.072
At any rate,
today you're going to get a

00:10:01.072 --> 00:10:04.465
sense of the real mindset of the
different sides because you're

00:10:04.465 --> 00:10:07.399
going to see people interacting,
and I have a number of

00:10:07.399 --> 00:10:09.879
different sort of eyewitness
accounts of different events,

00:10:09.879 --> 00:10:13.398
so you can get a sense of the
logic behind what people are

00:10:13.398 --> 00:10:17.038
thinking is going on as some of
these hostilities unfold.

00:10:17.038 --> 00:10:21.750
So today we're going to be
looking at conflict.

00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:24.607
In the last two lectures,
we clearly in one way or

00:10:24.607 --> 00:10:27.350
another have been leading up to
this moment,

00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:29.881
so we talked about Common
Sense, talked about

00:10:29.881 --> 00:10:33.403
the Declaration of Independence,
and in discussing both of those

00:10:33.403 --> 00:10:37.004
documents I've made several
references to the surrounding

00:10:37.004 --> 00:10:37.519
mood.
 

00:10:37.519 --> 00:10:39.663
And I think I've used several
times that the colonies were

00:10:39.663 --> 00:10:41.753
"on fire"--
and it was Paine's,

00:10:41.753 --> 00:10:45.419
a version of what Paine said,
that the colonies seemed to be

00:10:45.419 --> 00:10:48.928
on fire in 1775 and that's what
inspires him to want to write.

00:10:48.928 --> 00:10:51.744
So what we're going to do is
basically look and see what that

00:10:51.744 --> 00:10:53.340
means;
what is Paine referring to;

00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:59.261
what is happening in 1775 that
pushed him to feel so compelled

00:10:59.261 --> 00:11:00.330
to write?
 

00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:04.754
So we're going to look at the
physical aspect of events

00:11:04.754 --> 00:11:08.136
unfolding mostly in 1775,
a little bit in 1776,

00:11:08.136 --> 00:11:11.139
the physical reality of the
onset of actual hostilities,

00:11:11.139 --> 00:11:15.885
what the colonial hostility to
the British soldiers stationed

00:11:15.885 --> 00:11:19.410
in the colonies felt like,
how that was unfolding,

00:11:19.410 --> 00:11:21.500
what the British soldiers were
doing,

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:23.950
how they thought they were
going to stem the tide of

00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:27.192
whatever was happening,
But, as I've already said any

00:11:27.192 --> 00:11:31.159
number of times in this course,
even now when we're on the cusp

00:11:31.159 --> 00:11:34.905
of some kind of physical clash,
we're not looking at two

00:11:34.905 --> 00:11:39.907
competing groups of people who
see themselves as being entirely

00:11:39.907 --> 00:11:42.570
distinct and separate peoples.
 

00:11:42.570 --> 00:11:46.440
And we've certainly seen on
both sides a sort of gradual

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:50.732
realization that maybe the logic
of governance is different on

00:11:50.732 --> 00:11:53.193
both sides,
the logic or the understanding

00:11:53.193 --> 00:11:55.820
of the empire is different on
both sides of the Atlantic,

00:11:55.820 --> 00:12:00.765
but we don't have two peoples
here who see themselves as enemy

00:12:00.765 --> 00:12:01.740
societies.
 

00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:04.840
As Lord Rockingham put it in
Parliament,

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:07.288
speaking at the time,
he feared that they were

00:12:07.288 --> 00:12:09.587
looking at,
quote, "the dreadful

00:12:09.587 --> 00:12:13.220
calamity of shedding British
blood by British hands."

00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:16.080
So what we're talking about
here is civil war.

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:18.363
That's why I titled this
lecture Civil War,

00:12:18.363 --> 00:12:19.940
because that's what it was.
 

00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:21.740
It was a people divided.
 

00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:24.216
There are actually people
in--at the time,

00:12:24.216 --> 00:12:26.753
certainly I can think of some
in the 1790s,

00:12:26.753 --> 00:12:29.289
who call the Revolution the
Civil War.

00:12:29.289 --> 00:12:30.429
That's what it was.
 

00:12:30.429 --> 00:12:31.610
That's what it felt like.
 

00:12:31.610 --> 00:12:33.149
That really sort of drives that
home.

00:12:33.149 --> 00:12:40.129
Now the first battles of this
war are fought in 1775,

00:12:40.129 --> 00:12:43.679
but they don't represent a sort
of sudden plunging into the

00:12:43.679 --> 00:12:46.462
inevitability of war,
and it's actually quite the

00:12:46.462 --> 00:12:46.950
opposite.
 

00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:50.019
You'll see that as these events
unfold today.

00:12:50.019 --> 00:12:53.691
Both sides to some degree
really see themselves as

00:12:53.691 --> 00:12:56.696
behaving defensively,
and ultimately they point the

00:12:56.696 --> 00:12:59.405
finger at the other side,
but in one way or another,

00:12:59.405 --> 00:13:02.884
both sides feel that they're
trying to sort of prevent bad

00:13:02.884 --> 00:13:04.408
things from happening.
 

00:13:04.408 --> 00:13:08.995
Now on the colonial side,
people assumed that they were

00:13:08.995 --> 00:13:12.639
collecting arms,
that they were creating local

00:13:12.639 --> 00:13:15.269
militia units,
that they were beginning to

00:13:15.269 --> 00:13:17.793
stockpile weapons--
that this was all a defensive

00:13:17.793 --> 00:13:18.230
measure.
 

00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:21.269
And at the end of the First
Continental Congress,

00:13:21.269 --> 00:13:25.124
they actually had declared that
maybe the colonies should think

00:13:25.124 --> 00:13:28.418
about organizing themselves for
defensive measures.

00:13:28.418 --> 00:13:31.668
So there had been again not a
sort of "attack,

00:13:31.668 --> 00:13:32.900
attack"
measure from the First

00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:35.432
Continental Congress,
but, 'maybe it's time that we

00:13:35.432 --> 00:13:37.899
actually should really begin
organizing'--

00:13:37.899 --> 00:13:41.178
but again this is seen as a
defensive measure.

00:13:41.178 --> 00:13:45.087
That same kind of spirit of
defensive protection still

00:13:45.087 --> 00:13:48.259
infuses the Second Continental
Congress,

00:13:48.259 --> 00:13:50.793
and I mentioned in the last
lecture the two things that are

00:13:50.793 --> 00:13:52.058
happening at the same time.
 

00:13:52.058 --> 00:13:55.405
So the Congress is trying to
figure out what to do about a

00:13:55.405 --> 00:13:58.928
possible war and sending out the
Olive Branch Petition at the

00:13:58.928 --> 00:13:59.750
same time.
 

00:13:59.750 --> 00:14:01.818
Both of those things are
happening at the same time,

00:14:01.818 --> 00:14:03.278
so they're not jumping into a
war.

00:14:03.278 --> 00:14:05.750
They are preparing defensive
measures.

00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:09.937
On the British side,
the general assumption was that

00:14:09.937 --> 00:14:13.206
a few strategic moves,
a couple of really grand

00:14:13.206 --> 00:14:16.163
military maneuvers,
maybe one big display of power

00:14:16.163 --> 00:14:18.500
and the whole thing would
collapse--

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:21.004
that there's no way the
colonists could not be

00:14:21.004 --> 00:14:24.288
dumbstruck and awed by the force
of the British army so,

00:14:24.288 --> 00:14:27.501
whatever was going to happen,
there'd be one little clash and

00:14:27.501 --> 00:14:28.519
it would be over.
 

00:14:28.519 --> 00:14:31.605
And if they could just seize
the weapons and the ammunition

00:14:31.605 --> 00:14:34.000
and the things that were being
stockpiled,

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.230
they could sort of cut things
off before it even got any

00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:37.700
worse.
 

00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:40.812
They could just collect the
weapons and take them away and

00:14:40.812 --> 00:14:42.880
that--
the power, the ease with which

00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:46.035
they would have marched at this
point in to New England and

00:14:46.035 --> 00:14:49.065
seized arms and weapons--
would show the colonists that

00:14:49.065 --> 00:14:51.639
this wasn't worth fighting;
it's not a fight worth fighting;

00:14:51.639 --> 00:14:53.490
it's not a fight that they
could fight.

00:14:53.490 --> 00:14:56.479
So by trying to collect
weapons, trying to collect

00:14:56.479 --> 00:15:00.080
ammunition, they're trying to
stem--Again it's defensive.

00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:02.259
They're trying to stop things
from getting worse.

00:15:02.259 --> 00:15:06.312
Now there were a few reasons
why the British would have

00:15:06.312 --> 00:15:09.538
assumed one little gesture and
it's over.

00:15:09.538 --> 00:15:12.278
Now obviously,
the most obvious one is just:

00:15:12.278 --> 00:15:13.360
the British Army.
 

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:13.870
Okay.
 

00:15:13.870 --> 00:15:17.422
We're talking about the British
Army and a bunch of colonists

00:15:17.422 --> 00:15:20.797
who just went out and decided
maybe we'd better drill now.

00:15:20.797 --> 00:15:21.330
Okay.
 

00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:25.666
So certainly to the British
what they're thinking is well,

00:15:25.666 --> 00:15:27.720
'please, that against us?
 

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:31.028
Okay, we don't even have to
worry about that.'

00:15:31.028 --> 00:15:34.350
But more than that,
the British also thought,

00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:38.509
generally speaking,
that the colonists were a lot

00:15:38.509 --> 00:15:42.662
of bluster and little more,
that they just--they had a lot

00:15:42.662 --> 00:15:45.972
of hot air there in the colonies
but that there actually wasn't a

00:15:45.972 --> 00:15:48.700
lot more to them,
certainly not a lot of bravery.

00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:50.604
And the word
"cowards"

00:15:50.604 --> 00:15:54.105
is tossed around a lot in
letters and in writings and even

00:15:54.105 --> 00:15:57.298
in speeches in Parliament from
this time period.

00:15:57.298 --> 00:16:00.600
So as an example,
in the House of Lords someone

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:04.852
apparently stands up and says,
'There are a lot of men in the

00:16:04.852 --> 00:16:08.620
colonies who could fight against
us if they chose to fight.

00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:13.418
The colonies abound in men who
could serve as soldiers.'

00:16:13.418 --> 00:16:19.048
So the Earl of Sandwich stands
up and this is his response.

00:16:19.048 --> 00:16:21.364
"Suppose the colonies do
abound in men,

00:16:21.364 --> 00:16:22.710
what does that signify?
 

00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:24.966
They are raw,
undisciplined,

00:16:24.966 --> 00:16:26.220
cowardly men.
 

00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:30.783
I wish instead of 50 or 50,000
of these brave fellows,

00:16:30.783 --> 00:16:34.918
they would produce in the field
at least 200,000,

00:16:34.918 --> 00:16:37.158
the more the better."
 

00:16:37.158 --> 00:16:38.019
Okay.
 

00:16:38.019 --> 00:16:39.702
That's a really good arrogant
British comment [laughs]

00:16:39.702 --> 00:16:41.100
in the world of arrogant
British comments.

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:43.807
"Believe me,
my lords, the very sound of a

00:16:43.807 --> 00:16:45.750
cannon would carry them off ...
 

00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:47.480
as fast as their feet could
carry them.

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:49.417
This is too trifling a part of
the argument,

00:16:49.417 --> 00:16:51.399
to detain your lordships any
longer."

00:16:51.399 --> 00:16:52.230
Okay. 'Please.
 

00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:54.700
We're not talking about a real
threat.'

00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:57.990
Nor were the British very
impressed at the idea,

00:16:57.990 --> 00:17:01.605
this--the whole idea of
colonial civilians dressed up

00:17:01.605 --> 00:17:05.777
suddenly in military garb and
suddenly positioning themselves

00:17:05.777 --> 00:17:06.890
as soldiers.
 

00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:10.631
So one English visitor to the
colonies wrote a letter to a

00:17:10.631 --> 00:17:13.980
friend in England and expressed
the same feeling.

00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:18.546
He said, "It is a curious
Masquerade Scene to see grave

00:17:18.546 --> 00:17:21.808
sober Citizens,
Barbers and Tailors who never

00:17:21.808 --> 00:17:24.259
looked fierce before in their
Lives,

00:17:24.259 --> 00:17:25.970
but at their Wives,
Children, or

00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:27.240
Apprentices...."
 

00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:29.886
There's always the little
back-handed "gugsch"

00:17:29.886 --> 00:17:31.619
[laughs]
that sort of goes into these

00:17:31.619 --> 00:17:32.150
quotes.
 

00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:34.588
So they've only looked fierce
before at their wives,

00:17:34.588 --> 00:17:37.461
children or apprentices,
"strutting about in their

00:17:37.461 --> 00:17:40.387
Sunday Wigs in stiff Buckles
with their Muskets on their

00:17:40.387 --> 00:17:43.420
shoulders struggling to put on a
Martial countenance.

00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:47.420
If ever you saw a Goose assume
an Air of Consequence,

00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:51.230
you may catch some faint idea
of the foolish,

00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:55.098
aukward, puffed-up Stare of our
Tradesmen: the Wig,

00:17:55.098 --> 00:17:57.150
indeed, is the most frightful
Thing about them,

00:17:57.150 --> 00:18:00.846
for its very Hairs seem to
bristle up in Defiance of the

00:18:00.846 --> 00:18:01.990
Soldiers."
 

00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:02.275
Okay.
 

00:18:02.275 --> 00:18:05.470
That's a wonderful little
passage about exactly what some

00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:09.180
people thought it looked like
they were doing in the colonies.

00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:12.086
General Gage,
commanding the British forces

00:18:12.086 --> 00:18:16.034
in America, felt similarly,
that basically one big display

00:18:16.034 --> 00:18:19.150
of force and they could close
things off.

00:18:19.150 --> 00:18:22.063
And you can hear this,
as well as his impatience with

00:18:22.063 --> 00:18:25.256
this sort of ongoing colonial
hostility to the troops that

00:18:25.256 --> 00:18:29.789
were positioned in the colonies,
in some threats that he made to

00:18:29.789 --> 00:18:33.519
some Boston radicals that he met
with in 1775.

00:18:33.519 --> 00:18:37.318
So according to an account,
he, quote,

00:18:37.318 --> 00:18:39.940
"swore to it by the living
God,

00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:42.896
that if there was a single man
of the King's troops killed in

00:18:42.896 --> 00:18:45.558
any of their towns"
meaning any of your towns,

00:18:45.558 --> 00:18:48.217
your Massachusetts towns,
"he would burn it to the

00:18:48.217 --> 00:18:48.660
ground.
 

00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:50.509
What fools you are ...
 

00:18:50.509 --> 00:18:53.818
to pretend to resist the power
of Great Britain."

00:18:53.818 --> 00:18:54.108
Okay.
 

00:18:54.108 --> 00:18:55.960
That to me is like Darth Vader.
 

00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:58.148
[laughter]
What fools you are--It's like

00:18:58.148 --> 00:19:00.618
wow, [laughs]
that's a statement of power.

00:19:00.618 --> 00:19:04.759
How dare you hold yourselves
against the empire?

00:19:04.759 --> 00:19:08.701
The empire, "She
maintained in the last war

00:19:08.701 --> 00:19:11.894
300,000 men,
and will do the same now rather

00:19:11.894 --> 00:19:15.078
than suffer the ungrateful
people of this country to

00:19:15.078 --> 00:19:17.390
continue in their
rebellion."

00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:19.778
Okay. It's clear how Gage feels.
 

00:19:19.778 --> 00:19:22.180
So the colonies are preparing
to defend themselves.

00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:24.980
The British and Gage are
assuming a little display of

00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:26.490
force will end the matter.
 

00:19:26.490 --> 00:19:29.020
Neither side is assuming
there's a pending war,

00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:31.992
and you can see both of these
views in play at a little

00:19:31.992 --> 00:19:35.471
event--it's not a big moment;
it's actually prior to

00:19:35.471 --> 00:19:39.852
Lexington and Concord--that
plays out also in Massachusetts

00:19:39.852 --> 00:19:41.588
in February of 1775.
 

00:19:41.588 --> 00:19:45.127
On February 26,
Gage decided that he would have

00:19:45.127 --> 00:19:48.135
some troops move to Salem,
Massachusetts,

00:19:48.135 --> 00:19:51.299
to seize cannons and guns that
the colonists had collected

00:19:51.299 --> 00:19:51.798
there.
 

00:19:51.798 --> 00:19:53.130
So this is part of that
strategy.

00:19:53.130 --> 00:19:56.505
Well, let's just take the
weapons away and we'll march and

00:19:56.505 --> 00:20:00.176
we'll look impressive and they
will be nervous and this will be

00:20:00.176 --> 00:20:01.538
good on all counts.
 

00:20:01.538 --> 00:20:04.922
And I'm going to read from an
account of someone who was there

00:20:04.922 --> 00:20:07.805
actually who describes what he
saw and what happened:

00:20:07.805 --> 00:20:10.133
"On Sunday,
26th Feb'y, 1775,

00:20:10.133 --> 00:20:14.307
my father came home from church
rather sooner than usual which

00:20:14.307 --> 00:20:17.240
attracted my notice,
and said to my mother 'The

00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:19.872
reg'lars are come and are
marching as fast as they can

00:20:19.872 --> 00:20:23.095
towards the Northfields bridge;'
and looking towards her with a

00:20:23.095 --> 00:20:25.819
very solemn face remarked 'I
don't know what will be the

00:20:25.819 --> 00:20:27.950
consequence but something very
serious,

00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:30.394
and I wish you to keep the
children home.'"

00:20:30.394 --> 00:20:30.759
Okay.
 

00:20:30.759 --> 00:20:32.460
So you get a sense of, huh?
 

00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:34.589
There's soldiers marching now
towards us?

00:20:34.589 --> 00:20:36.410
What does this mean?
 

00:20:36.410 --> 00:20:39.780
"I looked out of the
window just at this time and saw

00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:42.973
the troops passing the
house," and apparently they

00:20:42.973 --> 00:20:46.048
were playing Yankee Doodle just
to be insulting.

00:20:46.048 --> 00:20:46.595
"Col.
 

00:20:46.595 --> 00:20:49.538
David Mason had received
tidings of the approach of the

00:20:49.538 --> 00:20:52.319
British troops and ran into the
North Church ...

00:20:52.319 --> 00:20:53.269
during service ...
 

00:20:53.269 --> 00:20:55.190
and cried out,
at the top of his voice,

00:20:55.190 --> 00:20:58.028
'the reg'lars are coming after
the guns.'"

00:20:58.028 --> 00:21:01.358
At this point several men ran
out to move the guns,

00:21:01.358 --> 00:21:04.763
and the account continues:
"My father looked in

00:21:04.763 --> 00:21:06.500
between the platoons ...
 

00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:09.217
to see if he could recognize
any of the soldiers who had been

00:21:09.217 --> 00:21:12.115
stationed at Fort William on the
Neck, many of whom were known to

00:21:12.115 --> 00:21:12.750
him."
 

00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:15.160
And that's always an
interesting little detail to me.

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:17.894
These soldiers have been there
long enough that there's just

00:21:17.894 --> 00:21:19.750
been mingling of soldiers and
people,

00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:21.678
and so here the troops are
marching and this person's

00:21:21.678 --> 00:21:23.384
father is sort of going in to
the crowd to see:

00:21:23.384 --> 00:21:25.220
If there's someone here I know,
I could ask him what's

00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:26.849
happening;
where--why are they coming here;

00:21:26.849 --> 00:21:28.730
what are their plans.
 

00:21:28.730 --> 00:21:30.650
"But he could discover no
familiar faces--

00:21:30.650 --> 00:21:32.768
was blackguarded by the
soldiers for his

00:21:32.768 --> 00:21:34.481
inquisitiveness,
who asked him,

00:21:34.481 --> 00:21:36.529
with oaths, what he was looking
at."

00:21:36.529 --> 00:21:37.339
You can actually hear that.
 

00:21:37.339 --> 00:21:38.640
'What are you looking at?'
 

00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:40.509
Like--'get out of the way.'
 

00:21:40.509 --> 00:21:40.835
Okay.
 

00:21:40.835 --> 00:21:43.766
So at this point,
there's a group of colonists

00:21:43.766 --> 00:21:45.848
who see the advancing troops.
 

00:21:45.848 --> 00:21:48.493
They go to this bridge that
clearly the British want to get

00:21:48.493 --> 00:21:50.410
to and march across to get to
the guns,

00:21:50.410 --> 00:21:53.502
and the colonists pull up a
drawbridge so that the soldiers

00:21:53.502 --> 00:21:54.730
can't go any further.
 

00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:58.804
And now we get this sort of
great and somewhat bizarre

00:21:58.804 --> 00:21:59.650
standoff.
 

00:21:59.650 --> 00:22:02.459
The British commander is
standing on one side and there

00:22:02.459 --> 00:22:05.528
are colonists on the other side
and the drawbridge is up.

00:22:05.528 --> 00:22:08.858
And the British commander said
that his troops would fire if

00:22:08.858 --> 00:22:11.058
the colonists don't lower the
bridge.

00:22:11.058 --> 00:22:14.130
The local militia captain says,
'Well,

00:22:14.130 --> 00:22:16.243
if you fire,
then you're all going to be

00:22:16.243 --> 00:22:19.497
dead men,' and supposedly the
plan of the militia captain was

00:22:19.497 --> 00:22:22.804
if anyone fired he was going to
run at the head of the British

00:22:22.804 --> 00:22:25.948
troops and kill him and then
throw himself in the river and

00:22:25.948 --> 00:22:29.308
drown himself so he wouldn't get
punished for killing a British

00:22:29.308 --> 00:22:31.730
soldier,
but he was--he had his plan;

00:22:31.730 --> 00:22:32.599
he was ready to act.
 

00:22:32.599 --> 00:22:34.930
[laughter] It's like: good plan.
 

00:22:34.930 --> 00:22:35.478
Okay.
 

00:22:35.478 --> 00:22:39.759
So at this point soldiers,
civilians--

00:22:39.759 --> 00:22:42.275
Our eyewitness says it
was--that it was a cold day and

00:22:42.275 --> 00:22:45.076
he noticed that these soldiers
aren't wearing coats and that

00:22:45.076 --> 00:22:47.638
actually they're beginning to
look really miserable and

00:22:47.638 --> 00:22:50.249
they're starting to shiver
because they're just standing

00:22:50.249 --> 00:22:53.048
there in front of the bridge
unable to go anywhere.

00:22:53.048 --> 00:22:56.587
And meanwhile some colonists
climbed out on the other side of

00:22:56.587 --> 00:22:59.358
the bridge and they're taunting
the soldiers.

00:22:59.358 --> 00:23:02.970
And apparently one particularly
loud person yelled out,

00:23:02.970 --> 00:23:05.663
"Soldiers, red jackets,
lobster coats,

00:23:05.663 --> 00:23:07.760
cowards, d--na--n to your
government!,"

00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:10.786
and everybody else shut them up
because they really didn't want

00:23:10.786 --> 00:23:11.858
to be fired upon.
 

00:23:11.858 --> 00:23:12.116
Right?
 

00:23:12.116 --> 00:23:14.048
It's one thing to just sit
there and mumble.

00:23:14.048 --> 00:23:16.480
It's another to say,
"Damnation to your

00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:18.855
government"
and taunt the British into

00:23:18.855 --> 00:23:19.588
shooting.
 

00:23:19.588 --> 00:23:22.114
At this point the British
commander said that he would get

00:23:22.114 --> 00:23:24.416
over the bridge if he had to
stay there until autumn.

00:23:24.416 --> 00:23:24.859
Right?
 

00:23:24.859 --> 00:23:25.630
He says, "By God!
 

00:23:25.630 --> 00:23:28.661
I will not be defeated,"
to which the colonial captain

00:23:28.661 --> 00:23:30.769
basically replies and said,
'Yeah, well,

00:23:30.769 --> 00:23:33.509
I think you already have been
defeated because you're here,

00:23:33.509 --> 00:23:36.210
and the weapons are there,
and I don't see you moving.'

00:23:36.210 --> 00:23:39.752
The British commander insisted
that this was the King's

00:23:39.752 --> 00:23:40.410
highway.
 

00:23:40.410 --> 00:23:43.795
"Old Mr. James Barr,
an Englishman and a man of much

00:23:43.795 --> 00:23:47.061
nerve, then replied to him;
'it is not the King's highway,

00:23:47.061 --> 00:23:49.662
it is a road built by the
owners of the lots on the other

00:23:49.662 --> 00:23:50.846
side,
and no king,

00:23:50.846 --> 00:23:53.978
country or town has anything to
do with it.'"

00:23:53.978 --> 00:23:54.490
Okay.
 

00:23:54.490 --> 00:23:56.298
King's highway, my foot.
 

00:23:56.298 --> 00:23:58.368
So now the British commander is
stuck.

00:23:58.368 --> 00:23:58.661
Right?
 

00:23:58.661 --> 00:24:00.118
He doesn't want to lose face.
 

00:24:00.118 --> 00:24:01.700
He's not going to surrender to
these colonials.

00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:03.558
He wants to do something.
 

00:24:03.558 --> 00:24:06.528
So this to me is the most
amazing part of the story.

00:24:06.528 --> 00:24:09.351
He actually proposes to the
militia captain that if he and

00:24:09.351 --> 00:24:11.480
his men are allowed to cross the
bridge,

00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:14.880
he promises that they will
march fifty feet,

00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:17.430
turn around and march back.
 

00:24:17.430 --> 00:24:17.804
Right?
 

00:24:17.804 --> 00:24:20.112
[laughter]
It's like: 'I won--[laughs]

00:24:20.112 --> 00:24:21.858
I got across the bridge.'
 

00:24:21.858 --> 00:24:23.298
They're not going to go after
the weapons.

00:24:23.298 --> 00:24:25.874
It's just a symbolic victory,
like: they got what they

00:24:25.874 --> 00:24:27.641
wanted,
the colonials backed down,

00:24:27.641 --> 00:24:30.117
we'll just march fifty feet,
we'll turn around and then

00:24:30.117 --> 00:24:30.578
march away.
 

00:24:30.578 --> 00:24:31.838
And that's exactly what
happened.

00:24:31.838 --> 00:24:34.747
They let them cross,
they march, they turn around

00:24:34.747 --> 00:24:37.298
and they march away,
apparently with the troops

00:24:37.298 --> 00:24:40.108
marching to the song "The
World Turned Upside Down."

00:24:40.108 --> 00:24:42.936
We see--We're going to see that
again in the--when there's an

00:24:42.936 --> 00:24:43.548
actual war.
 

00:24:43.548 --> 00:24:45.261
But okay, a little
symbolic--'okay,

00:24:45.261 --> 00:24:48.335
well, maybe I didn't entirely
lose face' kind of moment by the

00:24:48.335 --> 00:24:48.940
British.
 

00:24:48.940 --> 00:24:51.817
So there you can see pretty
literally the British assuming

00:24:51.817 --> 00:24:53.878
that a little marching,
a few threats,

00:24:53.878 --> 00:24:56.364
everything will fold,
they'll seize weapons,

00:24:56.364 --> 00:24:57.220
end of matter.
 

00:24:57.220 --> 00:24:59.130
That didn't happen here.
 

00:24:59.130 --> 00:25:02.221
You can see the colonists sort
of standing there defensively,

00:25:02.221 --> 00:25:05.260
not wanting to cause trouble
but also not turning around and

00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:07.348
running;
they're defending.

00:25:07.348 --> 00:25:11.730
Now at roughly this same point
back in England,

00:25:11.730 --> 00:25:14.945
even as some Members of
Parliament were sneering at the

00:25:14.945 --> 00:25:18.519
idea of these sort of fighting
colonials and as soldiers were

00:25:18.519 --> 00:25:22.568
trying to stave off trouble by
seizing weapons and ammunitions,

00:25:22.568 --> 00:25:25.654
others in Parliament were
actually thinking of trying to

00:25:25.654 --> 00:25:28.627
extend some conciliatory
gestures and maybe that would

00:25:28.627 --> 00:25:31.490
actually end this before it
became a lot worse.

00:25:31.490 --> 00:25:33.583
And in particular,
in the House of Lords,

00:25:33.583 --> 00:25:36.461
William Pitt made a number of
proposals trying to smooth

00:25:36.461 --> 00:25:38.900
things over;
all of them were rejected.

00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:42.037
So he proposes that perhaps
they actually could recognize

00:25:42.037 --> 00:25:43.549
colonial self-government.
 

00:25:43.549 --> 00:25:45.170
Okay. That didn't go very far.
 

00:25:45.170 --> 00:25:47.788
Surprise! He said, 'Okay.
 

00:25:47.788 --> 00:25:50.680
Well, what about withdrawing
British troops from Boston?'

00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:52.368
Rejected.
 

00:25:52.368 --> 00:25:56.311
Instead, in February 1775,
New England is declared to be

00:25:56.311 --> 00:25:59.618
in rebellion,
but now we have one last stab

00:25:59.618 --> 00:26:03.940
at reconciliation on the part of
the British: Lord North.

00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:05.848
And I'm mentioning this here
because I've already talked

00:26:05.848 --> 00:26:07.028
about the Olive Branch Petition.
 

00:26:07.028 --> 00:26:09.970
In a way this is the equivalent
on the other side of the ocean.

00:26:09.970 --> 00:26:13.646
What we--we're going to see
here is one attempt to extend

00:26:13.646 --> 00:26:16.602
one more offer that
maybe--maybe--at this last

00:26:16.602 --> 00:26:18.769
second will stave things off.
 

00:26:18.769 --> 00:26:22.258
People are trying to find a way
out of the problem and really

00:26:22.258 --> 00:26:25.048
struggling to find some kind of
mutual ground.

00:26:25.048 --> 00:26:27.980
So, Lord North passes a
resolution.

00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:31.140
It's ultimately called the
Conciliatory Resolution.

00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:35.596
And it proposed that any colony
that contributed to the common

00:26:35.596 --> 00:26:39.174
defense and supported the civil
government and the

00:26:39.174 --> 00:26:43.631
administration of justice would
be relieved of paying taxes or

00:26:43.631 --> 00:26:47.430
duties except as needed to
regulate commerce--

00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:48.440
and I'll repeat that.
 

00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:51.650
The Conciliatory Resolution in
February 1775.

00:26:51.650 --> 00:26:54.500
It proposes that any colony
that contributes to the common

00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:56.900
defense and supports the civil
government and the

00:26:56.900 --> 00:26:59.950
administration of justice would
be relieved of paying taxes or

00:26:59.950 --> 00:27:02.757
duties,
except as needed to regulate

00:27:02.757 --> 00:27:03.509
commerce.
 

00:27:03.509 --> 00:27:06.255
Many in Parliament were
somewhat stunned by this

00:27:06.255 --> 00:27:09.817
gesture, even though obviously
Parliament is not giving up any

00:27:09.817 --> 00:27:10.868
of its rights.
 

00:27:10.868 --> 00:27:13.506
It's just making a nice offer,
but it's not saying,

00:27:13.506 --> 00:27:16.565
'we don't have the power to
tax, we're just saying we won't

00:27:16.565 --> 00:27:17.038
tax.'
 

00:27:17.038 --> 00:27:18.720
But many in Parliament were
stunned.

00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:20.789
As one observer said,
"Uncertainty,

00:27:20.789 --> 00:27:23.020
surprise, distraction,
were seated on every

00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:25.568
countenance"
when this plan came forth.

00:27:25.568 --> 00:27:27.308
To some this seemed to be
backing down.

00:27:27.308 --> 00:27:29.750
To others it seemed beside the
point,

00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:32.101
that basically what the
colonies needed was firmness and

00:27:32.101 --> 00:27:34.324
these kinds of concessions
weren't really going to do

00:27:34.324 --> 00:27:34.880
anything.
 

00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:37.982
But the resolution goes forward;
North sends it on to the

00:27:37.982 --> 00:27:38.660
colonies.
 

00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:41.759
He very deliberately did not
send it to the Continental

00:27:41.759 --> 00:27:44.086
Congress,
which he didn't recognize,

00:27:44.086 --> 00:27:47.798
but instead he sent it to
individual colonial assemblies,

00:27:47.798 --> 00:27:50.840
thinking that if some of them,
even just a handful of

00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:53.630
individual colonial assemblies,
agreed to this,

00:27:53.630 --> 00:27:55.548
then the colonies would be
divided.

00:27:55.548 --> 00:27:58.246
And this is an example of
something we're going to see

00:27:58.246 --> 00:28:01.298
again and again and again in a
variety of ways in the process

00:28:01.298 --> 00:28:02.519
of fighting the war.
 

00:28:02.519 --> 00:28:05.125
It's a really common assumption
on the part of the British that

00:28:05.125 --> 00:28:07.269
all they need to do is just
divide the colonies--

00:28:07.269 --> 00:28:10.214
and that there are any number
of ways in which it will be

00:28:10.214 --> 00:28:12.950
really easy to just sort of ruin
their loyalties,

00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:15.240
turn them against each other,
and then this whole thing can

00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:16.190
be brought to a close.
 

00:28:16.190 --> 00:28:18.430
And what we'll see is what
they're underestimating.

00:28:18.430 --> 00:28:20.348
On the one hand,
as I've already talked about in

00:28:20.348 --> 00:28:22.211
lectures,
we've seen how hard it is for

00:28:22.211 --> 00:28:24.009
the colonies to do anything
jointly,

00:28:24.009 --> 00:28:26.920
but we've also seen,
if there's an outside threat,

00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:30.790
they actually come together
relatively effectively for a

00:28:30.790 --> 00:28:32.410
short period of time.
 

00:28:32.410 --> 00:28:35.282
So what the British are
underestimating here is that

00:28:35.282 --> 00:28:38.971
actually there is some unity;
there is a sense of united

00:28:38.971 --> 00:28:41.660
cause because of an outside
threat.

00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:44.200
So North passes the resolution.
 

00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:48.021
Obviously, it did not go far
enough at this point for the

00:28:48.021 --> 00:28:49.318
colonial leaders.
 

00:28:49.318 --> 00:28:52.483
It still maintained the right
of Parliament to basically do

00:28:52.483 --> 00:28:54.338
what it wanted to do with taxes.
 

00:28:54.338 --> 00:28:57.847
But also, in addition to not
being enough of a gesture

00:28:57.847 --> 00:29:01.255
towards reconciliation,
the timing was really poor

00:29:01.255 --> 00:29:04.561
because it didn't reach the
colonies until after the

00:29:04.561 --> 00:29:07.740
outbreak of fighting at
Lexington and Concord.

00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:12.260
Now given what I described at
Salem, you can see the continued

00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:16.412
logic of what the British troops
were attempting to do at

00:29:16.412 --> 00:29:18.338
Lexington and Concord.
 

00:29:18.338 --> 00:29:20.509
Basically, they want to seize
powder;

00:29:20.509 --> 00:29:22.440
they want to seize arms;
they want to get the weapons;

00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:24.900
they're going to march;
they're going to have an

00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:27.393
impressive display,
grab the stuff and leave,

00:29:27.393 --> 00:29:28.808
and make a big impact.
 

00:29:28.808 --> 00:29:32.634
Americans were very closely
watching the troops by this

00:29:32.634 --> 00:29:33.130
time.
 

00:29:33.130 --> 00:29:36.750
They knew, as soon as the
troops set out,

00:29:36.750 --> 00:29:38.748
that they were marching even
though the troops apparently

00:29:38.748 --> 00:29:40.747
were trying to be somewhat
secretive about what they were

00:29:40.747 --> 00:29:42.500
doing--
and here we have the famous

00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:44.959
Paul Revere moment--
and the poor William Dawes,

00:29:44.959 --> 00:29:46.876
the poor,
neglected William Dawes,

00:29:46.876 --> 00:29:49.349
like: 'me too;
he was there too.'

00:29:49.349 --> 00:29:50.578
He was riding along.
 

00:29:50.578 --> 00:29:52.757
Both of them,
Paul Revere and William Dawes,

00:29:52.757 --> 00:29:55.846
are riding, basically telling
people that the British regulars

00:29:55.846 --> 00:29:58.480
are on the move;
they're on the march.

00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:01.048
Meanwhile, the British are
marching towards Lexington on

00:30:01.048 --> 00:30:03.557
their way to Concord,
which is where the arms are,

00:30:03.557 --> 00:30:05.640
and they're beginning to become
nervous,

00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:09.334
because before they get to
towns they can hear the church

00:30:09.334 --> 00:30:10.390
bells ringing.
 

00:30:10.390 --> 00:30:13.290
So basically--'something's
going on in that town and we

00:30:13.290 --> 00:30:16.192
haven't gotten there yet,
so somehow or other they know

00:30:16.192 --> 00:30:17.160
we're coming.'
 

00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:20.528
One soldier later described how
a, quote,

00:30:20.528 --> 00:30:23.988
"very genteel man"
in a carriage stopped and told

00:30:23.988 --> 00:30:27.146
them that there were 600 armed
men waiting for them on

00:30:27.146 --> 00:30:28.400
Lexington Common.
 

00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:28.742
Okay.
 

00:30:28.742 --> 00:30:31.769
As we'll see,
there were not 600 armed men.

00:30:31.769 --> 00:30:34.761
There were maybe roughly
seventy men who heard the church

00:30:34.761 --> 00:30:36.644
bell,
knew that was a bad thing,

00:30:36.644 --> 00:30:39.174
grabbed their weapons,
and went to Lexington Common

00:30:39.174 --> 00:30:40.529
and are sort of standing there.
 

00:30:40.529 --> 00:30:41.930
Okay, not 600.
 

00:30:41.930 --> 00:30:45.111
The British entered Lexington
at about four o'clock in the

00:30:45.111 --> 00:30:45.670
morning.
 

00:30:45.670 --> 00:30:48.944
They saw this group of about
seventy people on Lexington

00:30:48.944 --> 00:30:51.268
Common, supposedly yelled,
"Rebels,

00:30:51.268 --> 00:30:52.400
disperse."
 

00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:54.900
Americans later claimed that
what they said was,

00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:57.640
"You damn rebels,
lay down your arms"--

00:30:57.640 --> 00:31:00.112
so Americans always hear
the--if there is a slur the

00:31:00.112 --> 00:31:03.234
Americans hear it--
at which point a gun was fired,

00:31:03.234 --> 00:31:05.680
and it's unclear who fired the
gun.

00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:08.990
But when that gun was fired,
the British opened fire.

00:31:08.990 --> 00:31:11.410
There were a few American shots
in return.

00:31:11.410 --> 00:31:14.019
The American commander told his
men,

00:31:14.019 --> 00:31:15.830
quote, to "take care of
themselves,"

00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:18.545
which means run if you want,
and so they did,

00:31:18.545 --> 00:31:23.546
leaving behind eight dead--
roughly eight dead and ten

00:31:23.546 --> 00:31:24.390
wounded.
 

00:31:24.390 --> 00:31:27.191
And now the British continue
on, pushing on to Concord,

00:31:27.191 --> 00:31:29.628
which is why they came there in
the first place,

00:31:29.628 --> 00:31:32.118
to get the powder that's being
stored there.

00:31:32.118 --> 00:31:35.769
And they actually met more
militiamen on the way,

00:31:35.769 --> 00:31:38.029
and when they marched on them
these people actually fled,

00:31:38.029 --> 00:31:41.470
which is in a sense what they
were really expecting.

00:31:41.470 --> 00:31:45.414
The British began to destroy
these colonial stores,

00:31:45.414 --> 00:31:48.019
the ammunition and the weapons.
 

00:31:48.019 --> 00:31:50.994
Meanwhile, the colonists
collected near the North Bridge

00:31:50.994 --> 00:31:54.078
to stop the British and a few
British shots were fired;

00:31:54.078 --> 00:31:57.538
Americans fired a few shots
back before they withdrew.

00:31:57.538 --> 00:32:00.240
Again, it's only a temporary
retreat.

00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:02.378
So the Americans keep doing
something and then fleeing and

00:32:02.378 --> 00:32:03.730
then coming back and then
fleeing.

00:32:03.730 --> 00:32:06.328
It's a temporary retreat on the
parts of the colonists because,

00:32:06.328 --> 00:32:07.900
as a British officer later
reported,

00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:11.022
as they left Concord after
they'd destroyed these

00:32:11.022 --> 00:32:13.585
ammunitions,
quote, "We were fired on

00:32:13.585 --> 00:32:16.717
from Houses and behind Trees,
and before we had gone a half

00:32:16.717 --> 00:32:18.650
mile we were fired on from all
sides,

00:32:18.650 --> 00:32:21.194
but mostly from the Rear,
where People had hid themselves

00:32:21.194 --> 00:32:23.838
in houses till we had passed,
and then fired;

00:32:23.838 --> 00:32:27.237
the Country was an amazing
strong one, full of Hills,

00:32:27.237 --> 00:32:28.740
Woods, stone Walls...
 

00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:31.808
which the Rebels did not fail
to take advantage of....

00:32:31.808 --> 00:32:34.368
In this way we marched between
9 and 10 miles,

00:32:34.368 --> 00:32:36.420
their numbers increasing from
all parts,

00:32:36.420 --> 00:32:39.970
while ours was reduced by
deaths, wounds,

00:32:39.970 --> 00:32:41.400
and fatigue."
 

00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:44.859
And another officer later
recalled that he heard colonists

00:32:44.859 --> 00:32:48.137
and actually even saw some of
them standing in the road

00:32:48.137 --> 00:32:50.086
yelling out,
"King Hancock

00:32:50.086 --> 00:32:50.848
forever."
 

00:32:50.848 --> 00:32:51.126
Okay.
 

00:32:51.126 --> 00:32:54.395
Where that came from I can't
tell you, but they're out there

00:32:54.395 --> 00:32:56.779
sort of declaring their
political cause.

00:32:56.779 --> 00:33:01.430
This is hardly what the British
expected,

00:33:01.430 --> 00:33:05.303
and for that matter in a sense
the colonists didn't expect that

00:33:05.303 --> 00:33:09.214
sort of event to unfold,
but this level of colonial

00:33:09.214 --> 00:33:12.808
resistance to the British was a
surprise.

00:33:12.808 --> 00:33:15.848
As another British soldier put
it,

00:33:15.848 --> 00:33:19.769
"The enthusiastic zeal
with which these people have

00:33:19.769 --> 00:33:23.903
behaved must convince every
reasonable man what a difficult

00:33:23.903 --> 00:33:27.609
and unpleasant task General Gage
has before him.

00:33:27.609 --> 00:33:29.980
Even weamin had firelocks."
 

00:33:29.980 --> 00:33:33.527
So the British response on the
one hand is: 'oh,

00:33:33.527 --> 00:33:36.170
okay, they didn't just melt
away;

00:33:36.170 --> 00:33:38.798
this will be unpleasant for
General Gage.'

00:33:38.798 --> 00:33:44.292
All told, roughly 250 British
soldiers were killed,

00:33:44.292 --> 00:33:47.808
roughly ninety-five Americans.
 

00:33:47.808 --> 00:33:51.675
For the British obviously this
suggests, that little display of

00:33:51.675 --> 00:33:53.608
military might not be enough.
 

00:33:53.608 --> 00:33:57.607
For the colonists it revealed
the existence of an honest to

00:33:57.607 --> 00:33:59.470
goodness physical threat.
 

00:33:59.470 --> 00:34:02.343
As John Adams put it,
Lexington was proof that,

00:34:02.343 --> 00:34:05.028
quote, "if we did not
defend ourselves,

00:34:05.028 --> 00:34:06.838
they would kill us."
 

00:34:06.838 --> 00:34:07.217
Okay.
 

00:34:07.217 --> 00:34:10.239
John Adams always just states
it, okay.

00:34:10.239 --> 00:34:16.530
Almost immediately people from
both sides began to use the

00:34:16.530 --> 00:34:20.143
clash as propaganda,
basically playing it up so that

00:34:20.143 --> 00:34:22.155
they seem defensive and the
other side seems as though it's

00:34:22.155 --> 00:34:24.500
the aggressor--
so colonists sent riders out to

00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:27.717
tell people in other towns and
other colonies about how the

00:34:27.717 --> 00:34:30.659
British had killed every person
they came across,

00:34:30.659 --> 00:34:33.070
women and children;
they had driven pregnant women

00:34:33.070 --> 00:34:34.476
into the street;
[laughter]

00:34:34.476 --> 00:34:36.030
they shot dead old men.
 

00:34:36.030 --> 00:34:39.050
It's like: 'anything we can
think of, they did.'

00:34:39.050 --> 00:34:42.460
So obviously they're
exaggerating a bit what happened

00:34:42.460 --> 00:34:45.938
in Lexington and Concord,
but British accounts were no

00:34:45.938 --> 00:34:47.119
less creative.
 

00:34:47.119 --> 00:34:50.405
The British accused Americans
of scalping dead and dying

00:34:50.405 --> 00:34:52.351
British soldiers,
claiming, quote,

00:34:52.351 --> 00:34:55.077
they were "full as bad as
the Indians for Scalping and

00:34:55.077 --> 00:34:57.239
Cutting the dead men's Ears and
Noses off,

00:34:57.239 --> 00:34:59.856
and those they get alive,
that are wounded and can't get

00:34:59.856 --> 00:35:00.949
off the Ground."
 

00:35:00.949 --> 00:35:01.222
Okay.
 

00:35:01.222 --> 00:35:03.519
They're scalping live men,
those colonists,

00:35:03.519 --> 00:35:05.489
is what the British are
charging.

00:35:05.489 --> 00:35:08.369
They claimed that the Americans
had fired first;

00:35:08.369 --> 00:35:11.010
that Americans didn't fight
fair because they were hiding;

00:35:11.010 --> 00:35:13.804
that they were cowardly because
they were lying on their bellies

00:35:13.804 --> 00:35:15.489
hiding instead of standing
upright,

00:35:15.489 --> 00:35:18.030
which is how a traditional army
was supposed to fight--

00:35:18.030 --> 00:35:21.606
but both sides clearly are
positioning themselves as being

00:35:21.606 --> 00:35:23.239
defensive at this point.
 

00:35:23.239 --> 00:35:27.661
In June of 1775,
the English got more evidence

00:35:27.661 --> 00:35:32.280
that the Americans weren't just
going to run.

00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:36.088
When colonists attempted to
station themselves on Breed's

00:35:36.088 --> 00:35:39.559
Hill in Massachusetts
overlooking Boston--not Bunker

00:35:39.559 --> 00:35:41.940
Hill actually but Breed's Hill.
 

00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:43.619
And the Americans are thinking:
'well,

00:35:43.619 --> 00:35:45.750
this'll be very strategic if we
go to the top of this hill,

00:35:45.750 --> 00:35:48.257
it overlooks Boston,
it's a good place for us to

00:35:48.257 --> 00:35:49.860
have power or control over.'
 

00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:53.228
The British see that as well,
and they attack to prevent the

00:35:53.228 --> 00:35:55.800
colonists from taking control of
that hill.

00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:58.050
The conflict is later called
the Battle of Bunker Hill--

00:35:58.050 --> 00:35:59.710
it should be the Battle of
Breed's Hill--

00:35:59.710 --> 00:36:03.148
but although the British
ultimately did claim the hill

00:36:03.148 --> 00:36:07.206
and could claim a victory,
it was a pretty expensive

00:36:07.206 --> 00:36:07.989
victory.
 

00:36:07.989 --> 00:36:12.079
They lost roughly one thousand
out of two thousand men.

00:36:12.079 --> 00:36:13.679
They had enormous casualties.
 

00:36:13.679 --> 00:36:17.929
The Americans lost roughly four
hundred men.

00:36:17.929 --> 00:36:20.813
The British really suffered a
lot of losses,

00:36:20.813 --> 00:36:23.630
and at this point Gage learned
a lesson.

00:36:23.630 --> 00:36:26.260
As he observed after seeing all
of these clashes,

00:36:26.260 --> 00:36:29.521
the colonists were,
quote, "not the despicable

00:36:29.521 --> 00:36:32.719
rabble too many have supposed
them to be."

00:36:32.719 --> 00:36:32.985
'Wow.
 

00:36:32.985 --> 00:36:35.860
They're less of a despicable
rabble than I thought they

00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:36.340
were.'
 

00:36:36.340 --> 00:36:39.164
"These people show a
spirit and conduct against us

00:36:39.164 --> 00:36:41.570
they never showed against the
French"--

00:36:41.570 --> 00:36:43.119
which I also think is
interesting.

00:36:43.119 --> 00:36:45.478
What he's saying is well,
we thought we knew these people

00:36:45.478 --> 00:36:48.088
from that French and Indian War
and they weren't too impressive

00:36:48.088 --> 00:36:50.123
then,
but they're actually behaving

00:36:50.123 --> 00:36:51.070
differently now.
 

00:36:51.070 --> 00:36:53.536
"Everybody has judged of
them from their former

00:36:53.536 --> 00:36:56.438
appearance and behavior when
joined with the King's forces in

00:36:56.438 --> 00:36:59.309
the last war,
which has led many into great

00:36:59.309 --> 00:37:00.000
mistakes.
 

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:03.489
They are now spirited up by a
rage and enthusiasm as great as

00:37:03.489 --> 00:37:05.699
ever people were possessed
of."

00:37:05.699 --> 00:37:09.547
Colonists also learned a
lesson, and you can see this

00:37:09.547 --> 00:37:12.360
most dramatically in New York
State.

00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:15.072
New York at the time:
There were a number of

00:37:15.072 --> 00:37:18.860
Conservatives and Loyalists who
were in power in New York.

00:37:18.860 --> 00:37:21.070
It wasn't a radical colony.
 

00:37:21.070 --> 00:37:24.871
They had actually sent more
conservative delegates to the

00:37:24.871 --> 00:37:26.840
First Continental Congress.
 

00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:29.965
There had even been talk in New
York about not sending delegates

00:37:29.965 --> 00:37:32.746
to the Second Continental
Congress because 'good men' got

00:37:32.746 --> 00:37:35.724
corrupted when they went to hang
out with those scary radical

00:37:35.724 --> 00:37:37.659
guys in the Continental
Congress.

00:37:37.659 --> 00:37:40.949
And basically the Crown saw New
York as a good thing,

00:37:40.949 --> 00:37:44.617
because they were sort of more
loyal than many of the other

00:37:44.617 --> 00:37:45.440
colonies.
 

00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:49.309
That's New York before the
events I've talked about today.

00:37:49.309 --> 00:37:53.010
After these events New York
made something of a turnaround.

00:37:53.010 --> 00:37:56.000
They hanged Lord North in
effigy;

00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:00.947
they seized arms belonging to
the city and distributed them to

00:38:00.947 --> 00:38:03.277
citizens;
and ultimately the British

00:38:03.277 --> 00:38:06.485
marched out of New York City and
retreated to a ship in the

00:38:06.485 --> 00:38:09.472
harbor with the colonists
grabbing at their baggage and

00:38:09.472 --> 00:38:11.409
their ammunition as they left.
 

00:38:11.409 --> 00:38:14.639
So that obviously shows that
there is an impact.

00:38:14.639 --> 00:38:17.804
All over the colonies people
began to feel the need to

00:38:17.804 --> 00:38:18.880
prepare for war.
 

00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:23.449
As one colonist wrote in July
of 1775,

00:38:23.449 --> 00:38:26.780
"Travel through whatever
part of this country you will,

00:38:26.780 --> 00:38:30.949
you see the inhabitants
training, making firelocks,

00:38:30.949 --> 00:38:32.800
casting mortars,
shells and shot,

00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:34.480
and making saltpetre."
 

00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:38.733
Philadelphia was decorated with
flags announcing liberty or

00:38:38.733 --> 00:38:39.320
death.
 

00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:43.079
People are really now motivated
with a real--I guess rage and

00:38:43.079 --> 00:38:46.400
enthusiasm is a good way of
putting it at these recent

00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:47.090
events.
 

00:38:47.090 --> 00:38:52.603
So now you truly do get a sense
of how the colonies were indeed

00:38:52.603 --> 00:38:54.559
set on fire in 1775.
 

00:38:54.559 --> 00:38:59.139
You can see what it is that
Paine was responding to.

00:38:59.139 --> 00:39:02.981
You can see why in January of
1776 when Common Sense

00:39:02.981 --> 00:39:06.253
was published why it had the
impact it did,

00:39:06.253 --> 00:39:09.809
because people were ready to
hear its message.

00:39:09.809 --> 00:39:13.956
They were willing to at least
begin to consider independence

00:39:13.956 --> 00:39:16.768
because of what was unfolding in
1775.

00:39:16.768 --> 00:39:20.260
Things were at a difficult
point at this point,

00:39:20.260 --> 00:39:23.014
and if you step back and just
look at the larger logic of

00:39:23.014 --> 00:39:25.311
what's going on,
you can really see how

00:39:25.311 --> 00:39:28.775
difficult it would have been to
find your way out of this

00:39:28.775 --> 00:39:29.579
situation.
 

00:39:29.579 --> 00:39:33.432
The British administration
couldn't really yield to demands

00:39:33.432 --> 00:39:36.753
of the Continental Congress
without sacrificing its

00:39:36.753 --> 00:39:40.913
sovereignty over the colonies,
and I suppose in their eyes,

00:39:40.913 --> 00:39:44.449
also humiliating itself before
the eyes of the world.

00:39:44.449 --> 00:39:47.695
Along similar lines,
the colonists couldn't really

00:39:47.695 --> 00:39:51.469
back down about their demands
without seeming to surrender

00:39:51.469 --> 00:39:55.710
what they considered to be some
of their fundamental rights.

00:39:55.710 --> 00:39:58.768
They suspected British attempts
at conciliation anyway because

00:39:58.768 --> 00:40:00.539
they--
every time the British made any

00:40:00.539 --> 00:40:03.277
sort of gesture that seemed to
be moving in the right direction

00:40:03.277 --> 00:40:04.559
their thought was:
'well,

00:40:04.559 --> 00:40:08.119
yeah, they're trying to appease
us so we stop protesting,

00:40:08.119 --> 00:40:11.449
but they're just going to be
tyrants underneath it all;

00:40:11.449 --> 00:40:15.510
they're basically trying to
make us quiet so they can impose

00:40:15.510 --> 00:40:16.820
tyranny upon us.'
 

00:40:16.820 --> 00:40:20.806
But I do want to point out--Now
I've just described all of these

00:40:20.806 --> 00:40:23.528
dramatic events,
men being killed,

00:40:23.528 --> 00:40:27.860
battles, people storing arms,
a lot of drama,

00:40:27.860 --> 00:40:33.900
but I've talked about 1775
throughout this entire class,

00:40:33.900 --> 00:40:37.623
right?--and independence isn't
declared until roughly a year

00:40:37.623 --> 00:40:38.130
later.
 

00:40:38.130 --> 00:40:43.202
Again, which is a really
dramatic way of seeing that war

00:40:43.202 --> 00:40:46.757
is not inevitable,
that people are struggling to

00:40:46.757 --> 00:40:50.050
avoid it even as they're doing
all of this and taking all of

00:40:50.050 --> 00:40:53.510
these actions and acting in the
moment at what's unfolding.

00:40:53.510 --> 00:40:56.893
Even after Lexington and
Concord in July of 1775,

00:40:56.893 --> 00:41:00.913
the Continental Congress still
sends out that Olive Branch

00:41:00.913 --> 00:41:01.829
Petition.
 

00:41:01.829 --> 00:41:07.730
The Americans saw themselves as
Britons as well as Americans.

00:41:07.730 --> 00:41:11.192
They were defending their
rights as British subjects,

00:41:11.192 --> 00:41:15.054
and only over time did they
really gradually work their way

00:41:15.054 --> 00:41:16.719
towards independence.
 

00:41:16.719 --> 00:41:19.541
They had first assumed that
there was a small group of

00:41:19.541 --> 00:41:22.791
corrupt government ministers who
maybe were leading things the

00:41:22.791 --> 00:41:24.989
wrong way,
then they decided well,

00:41:24.989 --> 00:41:27.849
maybe it was Parliament that
was the problem,

00:41:27.849 --> 00:41:31.809
and only when the last prop of
the British constitution,

00:41:31.809 --> 00:41:34.809
the monarch,
proved deaf to their cause,

00:41:34.809 --> 00:41:38.481
did colonists begin to feel
that independence might be

00:41:38.481 --> 00:41:42.500
possible and ultimately maybe
was going to be necessary.

00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:42.882
Okay.
 

00:41:42.882 --> 00:41:45.110
So where does this leave us?
 

00:41:45.110 --> 00:41:48.204
Well, obviously,
it leaves us with a really

00:41:48.204 --> 00:41:52.699
enormous looming challenge
facing the Continental Congress.

00:41:52.699 --> 00:41:53.010
Right?
 

00:41:53.010 --> 00:41:54.871
Think about:
the Continental Congress

00:41:54.871 --> 00:41:58.262
doesn't really have any power,
all these delegates in there,

00:41:58.262 --> 00:42:01.079
and now "poof,"
they somehow have to help

00:42:01.079 --> 00:42:04.177
organize a united war effort
with no mechanism for doing

00:42:04.177 --> 00:42:07.559
anything in a united,
organized manner.

00:42:07.559 --> 00:42:11.172
And I'm going to end the
lecture by letting John Adams

00:42:11.172 --> 00:42:13.829
sum up this challenge at this
point,

00:42:13.829 --> 00:42:16.420
what it felt like to be in the
Continental Congress at this

00:42:16.420 --> 00:42:19.440
scary point--
and he wrote this letter in

00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:23.489
1775 to his wife actually,
to Abigail.

00:42:23.489 --> 00:42:26.364
And he wrote,
"When 50 or 60 Men have a

00:42:26.364 --> 00:42:29.639
Constitution to form for a great
Empire"--

00:42:29.639 --> 00:42:31.800
I like the fact that it's a
great empire already--

00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:35.346
"at the same Time they
have a Country of 1500 Miles

00:42:35.346 --> 00:42:38.646
extent to fortify,
Millions to arm and train,

00:42:38.646 --> 00:42:42.001
a Naval Power to begin,
an extensive Commerce to

00:42:42.001 --> 00:42:45.518
regulate, numerous Tribes of
Indians to negotiate with,

00:42:45.518 --> 00:42:49.130
a standing Army of Twenty seven
Thousand Men to raise pay,

00:42:49.130 --> 00:42:53.155
victual and officer,
I shall really pity those 50 or

00:42:53.155 --> 00:42:54.340
60 men."
 

00:42:54.340 --> 00:42:55.900
[laughs] Okay.
 

00:42:55.900 --> 00:42:58.557
So that's Adams saying,
'Boy, I'm not looking forward

00:42:58.557 --> 00:42:59.070
to this.
 

00:42:59.070 --> 00:43:01.860
This is going to be an enormous
task.'

00:43:01.860 --> 00:43:04.867
And what we're going to be
looking at Tuesday is that very

00:43:04.867 --> 00:43:05.289
thing.
 

00:43:05.289 --> 00:43:07.550
How do you hold a war?
 

00:43:07.550 --> 00:43:10.059
How do you begin to organize
this kind of effort?

00:43:10.059 --> 00:43:12.710
What were the things that
Congress immediately did?

00:43:12.710 --> 00:43:14.630
George Washington is going to
appear.

00:43:14.630 --> 00:43:17.364
That's one of the things the
Continental Congress does at an

00:43:17.364 --> 00:43:19.981
early point is find--
try to create a continental

00:43:19.981 --> 00:43:23.311
army and Washington walked on to
the national scene at this

00:43:23.311 --> 00:43:23.829
point.
 

00:43:23.829 --> 00:43:26.342
So we will look at the
unfolding of the war from a

00:43:26.342 --> 00:43:27.780
different angle next week.
 

00:43:27.780 --> 00:43:29.369
I will stop there.
 

00:43:29.369 --> 00:43:35.000

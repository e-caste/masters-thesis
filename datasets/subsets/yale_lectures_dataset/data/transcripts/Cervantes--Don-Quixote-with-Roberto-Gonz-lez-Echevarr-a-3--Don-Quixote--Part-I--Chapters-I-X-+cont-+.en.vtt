00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:08.303
Prof: Let me begin by
repeating my last point in last

00:00:08.303 --> 00:00:11.030
Tuesday's lecture.
 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:17.052
The birth of Don Quixote
is an act of self invention by a

00:00:17.052 --> 00:00:20.972
man of fifty,
and remember that fifty is a

00:00:20.972 --> 00:00:23.840
very advanced age in 1605.
 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:29.280
He feels free to create himself
beyond family birth and need.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:33.357
In this, the novel is directly
opposed to most previous

00:00:33.357 --> 00:00:37.811
literature, particularly the
romances of chivalry where they

00:00:37.811 --> 00:00:39.850
were miraculous births.
 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.110
And the picaresque,
very much in particular,

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.824
the picaresque,
in which family background and

00:00:46.824 --> 00:00:49.660
need determined the life of the
protagonist,

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:51.970
or so he claims as he tells his
life,

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:56.168
his poverty,
and the family background

00:00:56.168 --> 00:01:02.523
weighs heavily on the rest of
his life in the case of the

00:01:02.523 --> 00:01:05.358
pícaro.
 

00:01:05.358 --> 00:01:08.989
Don Quixote is beyond family
and social determinisms.

00:01:08.989 --> 00:01:13.144
In most previous stories,
young people leave home in

00:01:13.144 --> 00:01:16.811
search of adventures that will
give substance,

00:01:16.811 --> 00:01:20.480
meaning and individuality to
their lives.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:26.310
Can you think of another old
protagonist before Don Quixote?

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.123
How old was the pilgrim in
the Divine Comedy?

00:01:29.123 --> 00:01:30.780
I think he was thirty-three.
 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.209
How old was Odysseus in the
Odyssey?

00:01:35.209 --> 00:01:37.629
How old Aeneas in the
Aeneid?

00:01:37.629 --> 00:01:41.102
Celestina, it is true,
was old, but she shares the

00:01:41.102 --> 00:01:43.230
limelight with young lovers.
 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:46.650
Don Quixote,
as I think I said in the last

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.989
class, is beyond Freud,
beyond the family romance.

00:01:50.989 --> 00:01:54.409
In fact, though we learn a
great deal about him in the

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:56.795
first chapter,
we learn nothing of his

00:01:56.795 --> 00:01:57.569
parents.
 

00:01:57.569 --> 00:02:01.968
His genealogy is literary,
the books that he has read.

00:02:01.968 --> 00:02:07.950
The most innovative aspect of
Don Quixote is the character's

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.219
self fashioning as Steve
Greenblatt would put it in a

00:02:13.219 --> 00:02:18.389
book called Renaissance
Self-Fashioning.

00:02:18.389 --> 00:02:22.744
The reader witnesses this self
transformation in all its

00:02:22.744 --> 00:02:27.573
levels, from the mental to the
physical, from what Don Quixote

00:02:27.573 --> 00:02:29.788
thinks to what he wears.
 

00:02:29.788 --> 00:02:36.690
He, not an author,
names him, his horse and his

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:37.740
lady.
 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:41.410
His is a life that will be
molded like a work to art.

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.639
Life will imitate art.
 

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:49.972
But what is the significance of
this self invention,

00:02:49.972 --> 00:02:52.860
of this resurrection as it
were?

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:59.598
Renaissance humanism emphasized
the power of human agency.

00:02:59.598 --> 00:03:04.266
It is the beginning of a
liberation from a God-centered

00:03:04.266 --> 00:03:08.068
conception of the world and of
human kind.

00:03:08.068 --> 00:03:13.778
Remember, the Lukács
quote about the Quixote

00:03:13.778 --> 00:03:20.389
being the first story of a world
that has been abandoned by God.

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:24.712
So in this world abandoned by
God man creates himself,

00:03:24.712 --> 00:03:27.158
Don Quixote creates himself.
 

00:03:27.158 --> 00:03:29.873
"En un lugar de la
Mancha de cuyo

00:03:29.873 --> 00:03:31.300
nombre..."
 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.970
This is the first sentence of
the book.

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.257
Jarvis translates:
"In a village of La Mancha

00:03:38.257 --> 00:03:41.280
the name of which I purposely
omit there lived long ago."

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.479
This is a sentence,
by the way, that most literate

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:48.396
native speakers of Spanish know
by heart even if they haven't

00:03:48.396 --> 00:03:51.008
read the rest of the
Quixote.

00:03:51.008 --> 00:03:54.488
And the disclaimer,
"de cuyo nombre no

00:03:54.488 --> 00:03:59.050
quiero acordarme"
is also used in conversation,

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:03.718
to say I don't want to remember
this.

00:04:03.718 --> 00:04:08.419
Now, it is known the way that
English speakers know,

00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:11.479
"It was the best of
times," "it was the

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:14.538
worst of times,"
A Tale of Two Cities,

00:04:14.538 --> 00:04:18.439
or, "Call me Ishmael,
"the beginning of Moby

00:04:18.439 --> 00:04:20.110
Dick and so forth.
 

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:22.720
In the Quixote
literature appears,

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.805
as I've been saying,
as a realm of self legitimation

00:04:26.805 --> 00:04:31.370
and the display of wit and
capacity for invention which is

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:36.098
what Cervantes appears to be
affirming in the first sentence

00:04:36.098 --> 00:04:37.540
of the book.
 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.641
He does not wish,
as a narrator,

00:04:39.641 --> 00:04:43.709
he does not wish to remember
the place in La Mancha where Don

00:04:43.709 --> 00:04:44.930
Quixote lived.
 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:50.420
It is a display of authorial
will.

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:54.350
The sentence is full of other
implications;

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:58.822
there is the echo of the
opening of traditional stories

00:04:58.822 --> 00:05:03.543
as well as that of official
documents that attest to one's

00:05:03.543 --> 00:05:08.100
being by stating where one is
from in the stories,

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:11.149
"in such-and-such a
country long ago"

00:05:11.149 --> 00:05:12.939
and the country is named.
 

00:05:12.939 --> 00:05:16.677
Or "my name is such-and-so
and I live in such-and-such a

00:05:16.677 --> 00:05:19.790
place, and was born in
such-and-such a place,"

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:21.100
a legal document.
 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:26.177
To make such a statement is
one's strongest form of

00:05:26.177 --> 00:05:30.240
grounding, but here willfully
omitted.

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:34.360
A place name that is erased by
the creative will of the author:

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:36.886
"No quiero
acordarme,"

00:05:36.886 --> 00:05:41.983
I don't want to remember it,
against the traditional

00:05:41.983 --> 00:05:45.899
formulas in which it is given.
 

00:05:45.899 --> 00:05:48.360
The origin, this origin,
this place,

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.442
this village,
this lugar as it's

00:05:50.442 --> 00:05:52.800
called in the sixteenth century
Spanish,

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:57.555
to which the protagonist
returns several times and

00:05:57.555 --> 00:06:01.338
definitively at the end is not
named.

00:06:01.338 --> 00:06:05.600
It is as if here the source
were non-determining,

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:10.040
as the age of Don Quixote is
non-determining in his

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:12.350
subsequent adventures.
 

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:16.040
This is perhaps the reason why
the origin,

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:18.680
which is also the
destination--because Don Quixote

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:21.699
will return to die at home
giving away the plot here,

00:06:21.699 --> 00:06:26.096
I'm sorry--this is perhaps the
reason why the origin which is

00:06:26.096 --> 00:06:30.567
also a destination is left blank
deliberately effaced from the

00:06:30.567 --> 00:06:31.300
story.
 

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:36.648
It is a non-place,
although many towns in Spain

00:06:36.648 --> 00:06:42.810
claim to be the town in which
Don Quixote was born.

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:45.759
Now, Don Quixote's name and
other names,

00:06:45.759 --> 00:06:49.607
we have all ready spoken about
quesada,

00:06:49.607 --> 00:06:52.172
quijada,
quejana,

00:06:52.172 --> 00:06:57.302
and by now you have read all of
these potential variations of

00:06:57.302 --> 00:07:00.209
Alonso Quijano's first name.
 

00:07:00.209 --> 00:07:05.060
The point is also one prevalent
throughout the book,

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:10.577
the fluctuations of language in
reference to meaning and to

00:07:10.577 --> 00:07:11.528
truth.
 

00:07:11.528 --> 00:07:16.209
If language is so shifty,
how can we express the truth in

00:07:16.209 --> 00:07:17.129
language?
 

00:07:17.129 --> 00:07:21.447
Spitzer, Leo Spitzer,
a great German critic who

00:07:21.447 --> 00:07:26.706
worked in this country for many
years and taught at Johns

00:07:26.706 --> 00:07:30.447
Hopkins University,
in the piece "On

00:07:30.447 --> 00:07:34.416
Linguistic Perspectivism"
that you will read in your

00:07:34.416 --> 00:07:37.180
Casebook makes much of
this,

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:42.089
and he makes much of this with
the knowledge of the linguist

00:07:42.089 --> 00:07:45.750
and philologist that he was,
you will see.

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:50.494
Language and its vagaries also
constitutes Cervantes's point of

00:07:50.494 --> 00:07:54.550
view about what is commonly
accepted as the truth,

00:07:54.550 --> 00:08:00.637
and how the truth can be
commonly accepted in a medium as

00:08:00.637 --> 00:08:02.920
shifty as language.
 

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:05.920
But the blurry name,
Quixote, quijana,

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:07.795
quesada,
and so forth,

00:08:07.795 --> 00:08:12.220
is also a way of playing with
the absence of determinisms as

00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:15.285
being from La Mancha,
a non-place,

00:08:15.285 --> 00:08:19.951
as it were, a name and a place
marked the characters in the

00:08:19.951 --> 00:08:23.250
epic and in the romances of
chivalry,

00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:27.358
and even the picaresque novels:
Amadís de Gaula,

00:08:27.358 --> 00:08:29.394
of Gaul;
Lazarillo de Tormes,

00:08:29.394 --> 00:08:32.580
Tormes is the river that goes
through Salamanca,

00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:35.246
by the way, in which the
pícaro is supposed

00:08:35.246 --> 00:08:38.023
to have been born;
Gúzman de Alfarache,

00:08:38.023 --> 00:08:40.320
a place that is named,
Alfarache.

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:45.139
But not in the Quixote
significantly.

00:08:45.139 --> 00:08:50.875
Now, Don Quixote names his lady
Dulcinea del Toboso and

00:08:50.875 --> 00:08:52.149
Rocinante.
 

00:08:52.149 --> 00:08:55.620
In the first case,
the lady, he follows literary

00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:56.580
convention.
 

00:08:56.580 --> 00:09:03.244
Her name rhymes with Melibea,
who is one of the protagonists

00:09:03.244 --> 00:09:08.778
of Celestina,
the beautiful young woman.

00:09:08.778 --> 00:09:13.190
And 'dulce' means
'sweet' in Spanish,

00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:19.567
so you can see the origin and
the intention behind naming

00:09:19.567 --> 00:09:24.495
Dulcinea that,
while the horse's name reflects

00:09:24.495 --> 00:09:27.278
something of his reality,
'Rocinante,'

00:09:27.278 --> 00:09:30.388
'rocín-ante,'
meaning he was a

00:09:30.388 --> 00:09:33.210
'rocín,' a
workhorse,

00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:35.590
before, 'antes' is
'before' in Spanish.

00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:39.928
Rocinante, the name,
does reflect in a very direct

00:09:39.928 --> 00:09:43.913
and comical way,
because it reflects precisely

00:09:43.913 --> 00:09:46.658
the reality about this nag.
 

00:09:46.658 --> 00:09:51.226
Don Quixote's capacity naming
for naming, as we will see,

00:09:51.226 --> 00:09:55.385
is quite extraordinary,
he is a man words and of the

00:09:55.385 --> 00:09:56.120
word.
 

00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:59.548
But the crucial point here is
that he is naming himself,

00:09:59.548 --> 00:10:03.788
his lady, and his horse as part
of this process of self

00:10:03.788 --> 00:10:06.578
invention,
like Adam, giving names to

00:10:06.578 --> 00:10:11.168
things in the Garden of Eden,
or God giving names to things.

00:10:11.168 --> 00:10:15.783
This is part and parcel of the
process of self invention,

00:10:15.783 --> 00:10:16.690
I repeat.
 

00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:21.289
Now, we move on to chapter II
which is one of the most,

00:10:21.289 --> 00:10:25.548
for me, remarkable moments in
all of literature.

00:10:25.548 --> 00:10:31.361
The protagonist has created
himself and he leaves at dawn,

00:10:31.361 --> 00:10:35.543
the beginning of a new day,
of a new life,

00:10:35.543 --> 00:10:40.029
and sets out on the Montiel
Plain alone.

00:10:40.029 --> 00:10:44.549
It is a will beginning from
zero, from a voluntary severing

00:10:44.549 --> 00:10:48.991
of ties with any possible
determining force except for the

00:10:48.991 --> 00:10:52.110
loss of chivalry and for
literature.

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:57.977
It is a moment of freedom,
of freedom achieved,

00:10:57.977 --> 00:11:01.038
freedom from the past.
 

00:11:01.038 --> 00:11:03.350
But as he goes along,
he anticipates,

00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:07.067
Don Quixote anticipates the
literary text that will be

00:11:07.067 --> 00:11:10.855
written about the exploits that
he is in the process of

00:11:10.855 --> 00:11:13.951
accomplishing,
or that he thinks he's in the

00:11:13.951 --> 00:11:15.528
process of accomplishing.
 

00:11:15.528 --> 00:11:18.308
There's a gap,
of course, between the high

00:11:18.308 --> 00:11:22.511
flown rhetoric of the romances
of chivalry that he uses and the

00:11:22.511 --> 00:11:25.970
literal plain--
there is a plain--upon which he

00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:27.860
gallops or trots probably.
 

00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:32.139
But this is precisely the gap
between literature and reality,

00:11:32.139 --> 00:11:36.448
between writing and experience
that will be at the core of

00:11:36.448 --> 00:11:40.230
Cervantes' exploration of the
nature of writing.

00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:46.072
The present and the writing of
the text hangs somewhere in

00:11:46.072 --> 00:11:51.813
between the reality and this
high flown rhetoric that are

00:11:51.813 --> 00:11:58.168
parallel and simultaneous in
their appearance in the book.

00:11:58.168 --> 00:12:01.692
This is quite remarkable and it
may pass unnoticed,

00:12:01.692 --> 00:12:04.370
but I want you to take notice
of it.

00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:09.860
It's on the translation we are
using, pages 26,27,

00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:14.120
Don Quixote,
as he goes on the plain of

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:19.432
Montiel says to himself:
"Who doubts but that but

00:12:19.432 --> 00:12:23.203
in future times when the
faithful history of my famous

00:12:23.203 --> 00:12:27.462
exploits are come to light,
the sage who writes them when

00:12:27.462 --> 00:12:31.500
he gives a relation of this my
first sally so early in the

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:34.931
morning,
will do it in words like this:

00:12:34.931 --> 00:12:40.351
'Scarcely had the ruddy feebles
spread the golden tresses of his

00:12:40.351 --> 00:12:45.684
beauteous hair over the face of
the wide and spacious earth and

00:12:45.684 --> 00:12:50.846
scarcely had the painted birds
with the sweet and mellifluous

00:12:50.846 --> 00:12:55.923
harmony of their forked tongues
saluted the approach of rosy

00:12:55.923 --> 00:12:59.605
Aurora who,
quitting the soft coach of her

00:12:59.605 --> 00:13:02.860
jealous husband...'"-- and
so forth and so on.

00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:06.919
He's using all of these
references to Classical

00:13:06.919 --> 00:13:12.393
mythology to refer to himself as
he projects the text that will

00:13:12.393 --> 00:13:14.600
be written about him.
 

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:19.460
Now, he arrives at the inn.
 

00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:27.144
We know, and this is a fact to
remember, from the episode in

00:13:27.144 --> 00:13:35.480
the inn, that Don Quixote leaves
home on a hot Friday in July.

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:37.428
How do we know this?
 

00:13:37.428 --> 00:13:41.484
We know it because they serve
fish to Don Quixote at the inn,

00:13:41.484 --> 00:13:45.605
explaining that the eating of
red meat is forbidden on Fridays

00:13:45.605 --> 00:13:47.428
by the Catholic Church.
 

00:13:47.428 --> 00:13:51.418
It was until the 1960s of the
past century.

00:13:51.418 --> 00:13:55.774
So it is clear because it is a
hot day and it is the month of

00:13:55.774 --> 00:13:58.750
July that this is a hot Friday
in July.

00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:02.837
The specificity of time and
place is a new feature of

00:14:02.837 --> 00:14:05.590
fiction, of this realist
fiction.

00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:09.807
As we saw, the romances of
chivalry took place in vague

00:14:09.807 --> 00:14:12.230
fabulous countries and times.
 

00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:16.238
Not the Quixote, which
derived from the picaresque a

00:14:16.238 --> 00:14:19.210
pension for the particular in
everything.

00:14:19.210 --> 00:14:22.658
It is the birth of what we know
as realism,

00:14:22.658 --> 00:14:26.678
whose origins and intention I
spoke about in the last lecture,

00:14:26.678 --> 00:14:32.370
interest in society at its
lowest level and the acquisition

00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:38.158
of aesthetic value by the
sordid, the ugly and the dirty.

00:14:38.158 --> 00:14:42.119
Now, the heat by the way,
would presumably and it says so

00:14:42.119 --> 00:14:45.212
in the text,
contribute to Don Quixote's

00:14:45.212 --> 00:14:49.956
madness according to theories of
the time which are probably not

00:14:49.956 --> 00:14:53.623
all together wrong--
if you are out in the desert in

00:14:53.623 --> 00:14:58.678
the heat,
you might lose your senses, too.

00:14:58.678 --> 00:15:03.754
But the weather is important
for other reasons in the

00:15:03.754 --> 00:15:06.615
Quixote,
specific weather,

00:15:06.615 --> 00:15:10.998
not the fabulous weather,
mists and all of that in the

00:15:10.998 --> 00:15:12.600
romances of chivalry.
 

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:18.302
Both parts of the novel take
place in a vaguely framed

00:15:18.302 --> 00:15:20.558
summer,
in part, because the heat

00:15:20.558 --> 00:15:22.399
contributes to Don Quixote's
madness,

00:15:22.399 --> 00:15:26.298
as I say, but also because it
makes it logical for everyone to

00:15:26.298 --> 00:15:27.960
be outdoors on the road.
 

00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:33.023
We'll see a little bit more
about why people are on the

00:15:33.023 --> 00:15:33.678
road.
 

00:15:33.678 --> 00:15:39.254
There's also the very important
issue that begins in these early

00:15:39.254 --> 00:15:43.058
chapters already of light and
visibility;

00:15:43.058 --> 00:15:48.086
being able to discern objects
and make them out,

00:15:48.086 --> 00:15:54.394
which leaves disputes between
the two protagonists about the

00:15:54.394 --> 00:15:57.389
nature of what they see.
 

00:15:57.389 --> 00:16:03.320
If you have been to Spain and
to Castile you know that the air

00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:04.389
is clear.
 

00:16:04.389 --> 00:16:10.942
It is hot and dry,
and the visibility is very,

00:16:10.942 --> 00:16:12.690
very good.
 

00:16:12.690 --> 00:16:16.533
This first inn is crucial
because it sets up one of the

00:16:16.533 --> 00:16:20.379
most important places where the
action will develop.

00:16:20.379 --> 00:16:25.134
Inns, as you will soon
discover, are way stations where

00:16:25.134 --> 00:16:30.769
all sorts of meetings take place
and hilarious scenes develop.

00:16:30.769 --> 00:16:34.817
The Quixote follows the
loose structure of the adventure

00:16:34.817 --> 00:16:36.674
book,
like the romances of chivalry

00:16:36.674 --> 00:16:39.602
that it parodies,
but also like the picaresque,

00:16:39.602 --> 00:16:43.639
so it needs these inns as way
points where characters from

00:16:43.639 --> 00:16:46.190
various origins and classes
meet.

00:16:46.190 --> 00:16:49.668
The inn can provide a kind of
archaeology of society,

00:16:49.668 --> 00:16:54.610
a moveable home for characters
away from home--

00:16:54.610 --> 00:16:57.323
What I mean by an archaeology
of society is that you see at

00:16:57.323 --> 00:17:00.615
the same time,
as you make a cut on the earth

00:17:00.615 --> 00:17:05.386
to study the various layers,
here you see various layers of

00:17:05.386 --> 00:17:09.640
social classes all present at
the same time in the inn.

00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:13.465
This is where the inn provides
what I call an archaeology of

00:17:13.465 --> 00:17:16.040
society--
It is at the inn that we

00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:20.849
encounter for the first time Don
Quixote's ability to transform

00:17:20.849 --> 00:17:24.028
crass reality into literary
illusion--

00:17:24.028 --> 00:17:26.348
although he has done some of
that in naming,

00:17:26.348 --> 00:17:30.786
of course, his horse--a process
that is highlighted by the fact

00:17:30.786 --> 00:17:34.650
that he is confronted with the
extreme of crassness.

00:17:34.650 --> 00:17:39.540
No ordinary women does he turn
into damsels,

00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:43.477
but whores;
not ordinary travelers but

00:17:43.477 --> 00:17:46.407
swine herders:
the lowest of the

00:17:46.407 --> 00:17:51.984
lowest--people who dealt with
pigs who are the lowest of the

00:17:51.984 --> 00:17:53.118
lowest.
 

00:17:53.118 --> 00:17:57.088
There is a grotesque contrast
between the innkeeper,

00:17:57.088 --> 00:18:01.369
the whores, and the knighting
ceremony, for instance.

00:18:01.369 --> 00:18:04.068
It's a clash of extremes.
 

00:18:04.068 --> 00:18:08.752
Is there an element ennoblement
in Don Quixote's dogged

00:18:08.752 --> 00:18:12.048
perception of the ugly as
beautiful?

00:18:12.048 --> 00:18:17.922
Is this one of the reasons the
book has endured,

00:18:17.922 --> 00:18:24.170
one's desire to ennoble reality
with one's will?

00:18:24.170 --> 00:18:28.066
Do we begin to glimpse here in
the madness a mission to force

00:18:28.066 --> 00:18:30.470
on to reality his perception of
it?

00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:35.720
But also notice that because he
treats the whores with

00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:41.170
deference, they are kind to him,
as is the innkeeper.

00:18:41.170 --> 00:18:46.277
It is a constant in Cervantes'
work that lower class people,

00:18:46.277 --> 00:18:50.519
even criminals can be kind in
given situations.

00:18:50.519 --> 00:18:57.159
There is no class determinism
in Cervantes making criminals

00:18:57.159 --> 00:19:00.250
evil, quite the contrary.
 

00:19:00.250 --> 00:19:04.758
His overall,
Cervantes' overall vision of

00:19:04.758 --> 00:19:11.255
humankind is a positive one;
no one is completely evil in

00:19:11.255 --> 00:19:12.480
Cervantes.
 

00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:17.486
In this, he is very different
from Shakespeare and his somber

00:19:17.486 --> 00:19:21.482
conception of the human,
if we are going to believe my

00:19:21.482 --> 00:19:25.269
very dear friend Harold Bloom
and his version of Shakespeare,

00:19:25.269 --> 00:19:28.440
in Shakespeare:
the Invention of the Human.

00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:34.112
Cervantes' view of humanity is
not as somber and you will

00:19:34.112 --> 00:19:37.858
discover this as you read the
book.

00:19:37.858 --> 00:19:41.212
It is also at the inn,
however, that Don Quixote is

00:19:41.212 --> 00:19:44.970
turned for the first time into
an object of amusement.

00:19:44.970 --> 00:19:49.521
The innkeeper plays along to
have something to laugh at that

00:19:49.521 --> 00:19:50.140
night.
 

00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:53.686
Are not the innkeeper and the
other guests in need of

00:19:53.686 --> 00:19:57.779
amusement like the 'idle reader'
that Cervantes addresses?

00:19:57.779 --> 00:20:02.692
Here is another level at which
Don Quixote is going to

00:20:02.692 --> 00:20:04.328
provide amusement.
 

00:20:04.328 --> 00:20:07.778
The ceremony of the knighting
of Don Quixote is a parody of

00:20:07.778 --> 00:20:11.848
those in the books of chivalry,
in the romances of chivalry,

00:20:11.848 --> 00:20:16.166
but do we not begin to notice
in this scene a certain degree

00:20:16.166 --> 00:20:20.118
of cruelty towards Don Quixote
and on the part of other

00:20:20.118 --> 00:20:23.118
characters and of Cervantes
himself?

00:20:23.118 --> 00:20:26.297
This is something that Jorge
Luis Borges, the great Argentine

00:20:26.297 --> 00:20:27.778
writer, has remarked upon.
 

00:20:27.778 --> 00:20:31.582
There's certain cruelness
sometimes in the way that

00:20:31.582 --> 00:20:34.318
Cervantes portrays his
characters.

00:20:34.318 --> 00:20:38.557
There is a hint that trying to
do the good can be ridiculous,

00:20:38.557 --> 00:20:42.160
and that no good deed goes
unpunished as it were.

00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:45.887
But this is so chiefly,
I think, because Don Quixote is

00:20:45.887 --> 00:20:49.339
a living anachronism,
he has conceptions of justice

00:20:49.339 --> 00:20:50.858
that are outmoded.
 

00:20:50.858 --> 00:20:53.777
Now, in the original,
the contrast between Don

00:20:53.777 --> 00:20:57.603
Quixote and the other characters
is achieved by means of the

00:20:57.603 --> 00:21:00.778
manners of speech and
dialectical contrasts--

00:21:00.778 --> 00:21:06.220
We will see that in a minute in
his fight with the Basque,

00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:08.653
I call him, Jarvis calls him
something else and we'll get

00:21:08.653 --> 00:21:12.031
into that in a minute--
Don Quixote's speech turns to

00:21:12.031 --> 00:21:13.058
the archaic.
 

00:21:13.058 --> 00:21:19.585
When he speaks about matters of
chivalry he uses archaic words

00:21:19.585 --> 00:21:23.650
drawn from the romances of
chivalry.

00:21:23.650 --> 00:21:27.865
This is a very important part
of Cervantes' achievement that

00:21:27.865 --> 00:21:33.452
is lost in the translation,
but that the English reader can

00:21:33.452 --> 00:21:35.498
gage,
that is, the differentiation

00:21:35.498 --> 00:21:38.261
between the characters or among
the characters by the way they

00:21:38.261 --> 00:21:38.670
speak.
 

00:21:38.670 --> 00:21:42.486
You can gage it by thinking of
a novel that was very much

00:21:42.486 --> 00:21:45.486
influenced by Cervantes,
The Adventures of

00:21:45.486 --> 00:21:47.190
Huckleberry Finn.
 

00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:51.146
Speech marks the characters by
providing their social station

00:21:51.146 --> 00:21:55.431
and even region of origin--
We will see that in a minute--I

00:21:55.431 --> 00:21:59.715
read The Adventures of
Huckleberry Finn as a child

00:21:59.715 --> 00:22:02.661
in Spanish and,
of course, they didn't

00:22:02.661 --> 00:22:06.795
translate into the Spanish the
dialect differences between Jim

00:22:06.795 --> 00:22:08.490
and Huck and so forth.
 

00:22:08.490 --> 00:22:09.960
I still liked the novel very
much,

00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:13.450
and then, when I read it once I
had learned English in college,

00:22:13.450 --> 00:22:15.720
I was astonished,
it was like another book,

00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:21.176
and I had a great deal of
difficulty understanding Jim's

00:22:21.176 --> 00:22:22.068
speech.
 

00:22:22.068 --> 00:22:25.318
This is prevalent in the
Quixote.

00:22:25.318 --> 00:22:30.750
It's perhaps the first novel in
which this is accomplished.

00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:36.201
The innkeeper is himself like a
literary character and a kind of

00:22:36.201 --> 00:22:39.750
Quixote in that he tells of his
youth,

00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:44.770
which is a youth misspent as a
pícaro as if it

00:22:44.770 --> 00:22:47.578
had been a romance of chivalry.
 

00:22:47.578 --> 00:22:52.021
He uses the rhetoric of the
romance of chivalry to tell of

00:22:52.021 --> 00:22:56.776
his life of petty crime and he
is a minor Don Juan who seduces

00:22:56.776 --> 00:23:01.098
widows and stuff like that,
he says with great pride,

00:23:01.098 --> 00:23:05.049
and he mentions the places
where he had been as if they

00:23:05.049 --> 00:23:09.361
were great places,
and they are really the most

00:23:09.361 --> 00:23:14.280
notorious emporia where
pícaros met in

00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:15.150
Spain.
 

00:23:15.150 --> 00:23:19.788
So he too can play Don
Quixote's rhetorical game;

00:23:19.788 --> 00:23:24.830
he's kind of an inverted mirror
image of Don Quixote,

00:23:24.830 --> 00:23:25.509
here.
 

00:23:25.509 --> 00:23:27.011
You have to read carefully.
 

00:23:27.011 --> 00:23:30.130
Cervantes is very subtle in
creating these characters,

00:23:30.130 --> 00:23:34.259
and here we have this character
sort of mocking,

00:23:34.259 --> 00:23:42.711
but at the same time using Don
Quixote's rhetoric to transform

00:23:42.711 --> 00:23:47.700
his life into something
important.

00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:51.362
So there is a kind of a
synthesis in this character

00:23:51.362 --> 00:23:55.391
between the rhetoric of the
romances of chivalry and the

00:23:55.391 --> 00:23:56.490
picaresque.
 

00:23:56.490 --> 00:24:01.240
This is what Cervantes achieves
through this very interesting

00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:02.190
character.
 

00:24:02.190 --> 00:24:09.509
Now, the knighting is obviously
a kind of baptism.

00:24:09.509 --> 00:24:12.963
It is a parody of similar
ceremonies in the romances of

00:24:12.963 --> 00:24:14.500
chivalry as I've said.
 

00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:18.006
It is true that it is a parody,
but in the fictitious world

00:24:18.006 --> 00:24:19.880
that Don Quixote is creating.
 

00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:23.578
It has a certain aura of
sacredness, nevertheless.

00:24:23.578 --> 00:24:27.193
The act completes the process
of self invention that began in

00:24:27.193 --> 00:24:30.935
the first chapter,
it legitimizes it within that

00:24:30.935 --> 00:24:33.771
world,
with the ceremony of his being

00:24:33.771 --> 00:24:34.490
knighted.
 

00:24:34.490 --> 00:24:37.453
Of course, he's being knighted
by a ridiculous retired

00:24:37.453 --> 00:24:40.753
pícaro in this inn
surrounded by whores and so

00:24:40.753 --> 00:24:42.843
forth,
but nevertheless,

00:24:42.843 --> 00:24:48.046
it has an aura of sacredness
and that he has finally achieved

00:24:48.046 --> 00:24:49.259
knighthood.
 

00:24:49.259 --> 00:24:53.888
Now, the two episodes in the
road after knighting intensify

00:24:53.888 --> 00:24:58.038
moral issues that Don Quixote's
madness brings up.

00:24:58.038 --> 00:25:03.509
Why does his madness bring up
these moral issues?

00:25:03.509 --> 00:25:06.940
Because in his madness he
refuses to abide,

00:25:06.940 --> 00:25:10.858
to recognize and to accept
social conventions.

00:25:10.858 --> 00:25:15.873
And that way he highlights the
arbitrariness of such

00:25:15.873 --> 00:25:17.250
conventions.
 

00:25:17.250 --> 00:25:21.913
Madmen and children do that by
asking why, why,

00:25:21.913 --> 00:25:23.028
why, why?
 

00:25:23.028 --> 00:25:26.890
Or by acting as if they don't
care why,

00:25:26.890 --> 00:25:29.920
and then bringing out that
these conventions are,

00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:33.184
indeed, conventional,
and this is why Don Quixote

00:25:33.184 --> 00:25:37.200
will,
once and again,

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:42.058
create moral crisis.
 

00:25:42.058 --> 00:25:47.152
With Juan Haldudo,
Juan Haldudo is the fellow who

00:25:47.152 --> 00:25:51.406
is flogging Andrés,
his servant,

00:25:51.406 --> 00:25:58.928
for having, according to him,
for having stolen from him some

00:25:58.928 --> 00:26:01.240
of his animals.
 

00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:04.041
With Juan Haldudo,
Don Quixote trusts in a kind of

00:26:04.041 --> 00:26:07.016
honesty that does not exist
anymore, or perhaps never

00:26:07.016 --> 00:26:09.588
existed, except in the books of
chivalry.

00:26:09.588 --> 00:26:15.588
His intervention makes matters
worse, as we know.

00:26:15.588 --> 00:26:19.928
This is the first of several
episodes in which the reader

00:26:19.928 --> 00:26:22.329
seems to be invited to judge.
 

00:26:22.329 --> 00:26:25.298
Who is right?
 

00:26:25.298 --> 00:26:28.819
There are hints that
Andrés may very well be a

00:26:28.819 --> 00:26:31.271
rogue,
a pícaro,

00:26:31.271 --> 00:26:35.438
and that he may have,
indeed, stolen from his master,

00:26:35.438 --> 00:26:38.704
in which case,
according to the laws of the

00:26:38.704 --> 00:26:41.509
land, Haldudo had every right to
flog him.

00:26:41.509 --> 00:26:44.358
In fact, when Andrés
appears later on--

00:26:44.358 --> 00:26:48.769
and he will reappear--he is on
his way to Seville,

00:26:48.769 --> 00:26:53.207
that's a telltale sign because
Seville was the center of

00:26:53.207 --> 00:26:54.660
picaresque life.
 

00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:58.868
Now, think of Seville as being
a very,

00:26:58.868 --> 00:27:03.288
very important port in Spain in
because it was through Seville--

00:27:03.288 --> 00:27:08.605
read your Elliot--that Spain
communicated with its overseas

00:27:08.605 --> 00:27:09.430
empire.
 

00:27:09.430 --> 00:27:12.568
Everything came in through
Seville, which is up the

00:27:12.568 --> 00:27:15.332
Guadalquivir River,
so it's protected in that

00:27:15.332 --> 00:27:15.960
sense.
 

00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:19.941
So Seville was a teaming port
and ports are always full of

00:27:19.941 --> 00:27:21.803
corruption,
and the like,

00:27:21.803 --> 00:27:26.015
because of all of the exchange
of goods and the various peoples

00:27:26.015 --> 00:27:27.170
who are there.
 

00:27:27.170 --> 00:27:31.288
So Seville was known for being
the center of picaresque life.

00:27:31.288 --> 00:27:33.130
So this details,
Cervantes throws in there,

00:27:33.130 --> 00:27:36.108
when Andrés appears
later and he's going to Seville,

00:27:36.108 --> 00:27:41.085
you say, uh-oh,
this is a pícaro,

00:27:41.085 --> 00:27:46.710
so he may have been guilty when
Haldudo whips him.

00:27:46.710 --> 00:27:53.608
Don Quixote is applying justice
that is anachronistic,

00:27:53.608 --> 00:27:59.042
because by this time Spain had
a very well developed and

00:27:59.042 --> 00:28:02.598
thorough criminal justice
system,

00:28:02.598 --> 00:28:05.838
very thorough and very well
developed.

00:28:05.838 --> 00:28:09.997
All of these matters found
their way--;-it was a litigious

00:28:09.997 --> 00:28:14.228
society, almost as much as the
United States is a litigious

00:28:14.228 --> 00:28:15.759
society nowadays.
 

00:28:15.759 --> 00:28:22.538
So the way that he intervenes
is totally anachronistic.

00:28:22.538 --> 00:28:26.366
Now, with the Toledo merchants
the conflict takes on a more

00:28:26.366 --> 00:28:29.998
philosophical even doctrinaire
tact, even though it is a

00:28:29.998 --> 00:28:31.450
hilarious episode.
 

00:28:31.450 --> 00:28:34.701
This is where he appears before
these merchants and says that

00:28:34.701 --> 00:28:37.734
they have to declare that
Dulcinea del Toboso is the most

00:28:37.734 --> 00:28:39.470
beautiful lady in the world.
 

00:28:39.470 --> 00:28:42.980
And at a distance he is saying
this one of them,

00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:46.848
who is a bit of a jester,
that Cervantes interjects,

00:28:46.848 --> 00:28:50.088
he says, "Well,
wait a minute,

00:28:50.088 --> 00:28:54.082
couldn't you at least show some
kind of a picture or something

00:28:54.082 --> 00:28:55.848
that we can gage this by?
 

00:28:55.848 --> 00:28:59.150
Because she may have some stuff
pouring out of her eye."

00:28:59.150 --> 00:29:01.190
And Don Quixote says,
"Nothing pours out of her

00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:01.670
eye!"
 

00:29:01.670 --> 00:29:06.368
and then he charges and
Rocinante falls,

00:29:06.368 --> 00:29:13.478
and this is a totally hilarious
episode, but can one believe

00:29:13.478 --> 00:29:16.369
what one cannot see?
 

00:29:16.369 --> 00:29:18.710
See what is behind this episode?
 

00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:24.854
What is the role of sensorial
experience in questions of

00:29:24.854 --> 00:29:25.858
belief?
 

00:29:25.858 --> 00:29:31.730
Isn't there also potentially a
socio-religious subtext here?

00:29:31.730 --> 00:29:37.147
Is it not likely that these
merchants from Toledo are Jews

00:29:37.147 --> 00:29:39.048
or converted Jews?
 

00:29:39.048 --> 00:29:41.390
That is Jews,
who have been forced to

00:29:41.390 --> 00:29:42.038
convert.
 

00:29:42.038 --> 00:29:46.952
Then is the test to which they
are being subjected not playing

00:29:46.952 --> 00:29:51.220
with the issue of conversion,
of forced conversion.

00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:55.415
It also seems to allude to
fierce debates in the sixteenth

00:29:55.415 --> 00:29:59.904
century about religious images,
which the Protestants did not

00:29:59.904 --> 00:30:02.849
allow and the Catholics did,
and so forth.

00:30:02.849 --> 00:30:06.098
The stakes are getting higher.
 

00:30:06.098 --> 00:30:07.900
And as I explained in an
earlier lecture,

00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:11.307
Cervantes presents his higher
stakes always in a light vane

00:30:11.307 --> 00:30:17.037
and a very humorous episode,
but still, these issues are

00:30:17.037 --> 00:30:18.048
there.
 

00:30:18.048 --> 00:30:20.804
Now, Don Quixote,
of course, is beaten to a pulp

00:30:20.804 --> 00:30:22.269
by one of the servants.
 

00:30:22.269 --> 00:30:26.359
This is the ultimate insult and
humiliation, to be beaten by a

00:30:26.359 --> 00:30:29.778
commoner after having been
betrayed by Rocinante.

00:30:29.778 --> 00:30:34.932
Rocinante just cannot really
move from a trot to a gallop

00:30:34.932 --> 00:30:39.075
without falling,
and you will see that similar

00:30:39.075 --> 00:30:42.019
things happen in the future.
 

00:30:42.019 --> 00:30:46.753
So Don Quixote is picked up by
Pedro Alonso--Notice the common

00:30:46.753 --> 00:30:50.945
names, Cervantes gives very
common names to very common

00:30:50.945 --> 00:30:51.798
people.
 

00:30:51.798 --> 00:30:54.382
Pedro Alonso is like being
called Peter Johnson or

00:30:54.382 --> 00:30:57.281
something like that-- So this
Pedro Alonso is one of his

00:30:57.281 --> 00:30:58.019
neighbors.
 

00:30:58.019 --> 00:31:02.825
He picks him up--and notice his
kindness not only picking up

00:31:02.825 --> 00:31:07.630
poor Alonso Quixano as he sees
his neighbor but also waiting

00:31:07.630 --> 00:31:12.761
until dark before going into the
village so that people will not

00:31:12.761 --> 00:31:16.019
see Don Quixote in this
condition.

00:31:16.019 --> 00:31:21.099
Again, it's an act of kindness
on the part of a very low class

00:31:21.099 --> 00:31:22.098
character.
 

00:31:22.098 --> 00:31:25.464
This is what I was saying
before about characters in

00:31:25.464 --> 00:31:29.160
Cervantes no matter what their
social class being able to

00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:31.470
perform these acts of kindness.
 

00:31:31.470 --> 00:31:34.780
There are echoes of the Good
Samaritan and so forth,

00:31:34.780 --> 00:31:37.896
and the Bible,
if you want to see biblical

00:31:37.896 --> 00:31:40.038
echoes in the Quixote.
 

00:31:40.038 --> 00:31:43.690
I have to tell you a brief
story, when a close relative of

00:31:43.690 --> 00:31:46.058
mine was in the hospital very
ill,

00:31:46.058 --> 00:31:49.241
and I used to go see him,
I used to spend the time

00:31:49.241 --> 00:31:51.838
sometimes reading the
Quixote,

00:31:51.838 --> 00:31:55.976
and I would get on the elevator
sometimes with my Quixote

00:31:55.976 --> 00:31:59.035
like this,
and there will be ministers who

00:31:59.035 --> 00:32:01.808
were also there to see dying
patients.

00:32:01.808 --> 00:32:04.403
Mostly, actually,
I should say,

00:32:04.403 --> 00:32:09.676
African-American ministers and
they would see me with the book

00:32:09.676 --> 00:32:14.000
and would nod as if
acknowledging that I was one of

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:15.470
their kind.
 

00:32:15.470 --> 00:32:23.138
So, now Don Quixote is madder
than ever because of the beating

00:32:23.138 --> 00:32:30.180
he has been administered and he
begins to return home.

00:32:30.180 --> 00:32:35.269
Returns home are always
problematic.

00:32:35.269 --> 00:32:39.167
Presumably one is returning to
the familiar,

00:32:39.167 --> 00:32:42.976
to the canny,
but now the house is going to

00:32:42.976 --> 00:32:46.150
turn into a very uncanny place.
 

00:32:46.150 --> 00:32:49.654
It is the house,
one must remember,

00:32:49.654 --> 00:32:55.532
it's also the abode of the
books, it houses the books that

00:32:55.532 --> 00:33:00.068
are the source of Don Quixote's
madness.

00:33:00.068 --> 00:33:05.209
So it is the familiar,
the home, but also the place

00:33:05.209 --> 00:33:10.038
where the source of his madness
is contained.

00:33:10.038 --> 00:33:12.338
It is also the place of his
first battles,

00:33:12.338 --> 00:33:15.056
as we learn,
where he would get up in the

00:33:15.056 --> 00:33:19.200
middle of the night and begin
slashing with his sword and,

00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:22.430
as we will see in a minute and
as I'm sure you read,

00:33:22.430 --> 00:33:24.130
it is a very malleable place.
 

00:33:24.130 --> 00:33:30.990
This house changes as if the
canny were also the uncanny--

00:33:30.990 --> 00:33:34.153
I'm playing here,
the background of my commentary

00:33:34.153 --> 00:33:37.250
here is the great essay by Freud
on the uncanny,

00:33:37.250 --> 00:33:39.029
the unheimliche.
 

00:33:39.029 --> 00:33:44.430
His theory being that the
uncanny is the canny,

00:33:44.430 --> 00:33:47.038
the familiar,
becoming suddenly unfamiliar,

00:33:47.038 --> 00:33:50.348
not something totally
unfamiliar, but the familiar

00:33:50.348 --> 00:33:54.536
becoming suddenly unfamiliar and
this is what is happening here

00:33:54.536 --> 00:33:55.818
with his house.
 

00:33:55.818 --> 00:33:59.368
Houses and shelters,
inns, palaces,

00:33:59.368 --> 00:34:05.214
and all of those are very
important in the Quixote

00:34:05.214 --> 00:34:09.599
and I urge you to take notice of
them.

00:34:09.599 --> 00:34:13.858
Now, either here or after the
scrutiny is where the

00:34:13.858 --> 00:34:16.349
Quixote was going to end.
 

00:34:16.349 --> 00:34:18.981
According to one of the
theories that is contained in

00:34:18.981 --> 00:34:21.463
your Casebook,
the essay by Menéndez

00:34:21.463 --> 00:34:23.938
Pidal--
I will talk about the end of

00:34:23.938 --> 00:34:28.119
the scrutiny but this is a very
important point that I want to

00:34:28.119 --> 00:34:30.449
make today to speak about that.
 

00:34:30.449 --> 00:34:34.668
In any case,
this return home brings up the

00:34:34.668 --> 00:34:38.961
issue of repetition,
which leads the philosophical

00:34:38.961 --> 00:34:43.065
question of whether there can be
repetition and the aesthetic

00:34:43.065 --> 00:34:46.688
problem of representation
because representing is also

00:34:46.688 --> 00:34:50.449
always a form of repetition:
repeating something,

00:34:50.449 --> 00:34:56.268
and the issue of representation
is at the core of the questions

00:34:56.268 --> 00:35:01.994
about literature that Cervantes
brings up throughout the whole

00:35:01.994 --> 00:35:02.840
book.
 

00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:06.574
It also dovetails with Don
Quixote's own project to revive

00:35:06.574 --> 00:35:07.690
the heroic age.
 

00:35:07.690 --> 00:35:09.690
Can something be revived?
 

00:35:09.690 --> 00:35:12.849
Can it be repeated?
 

00:35:12.849 --> 00:35:17.521
The return also allows for a
fuller analysis of Don Quixote's

00:35:17.521 --> 00:35:18.300
madness.
 

00:35:18.300 --> 00:35:21.708
The housekeeper and the niece
relate adventures of Don

00:35:21.708 --> 00:35:24.090
Quixote's prior to his first
sally.

00:35:24.090 --> 00:35:26.981
The niece recounts how he would
read for two days and nights

00:35:26.981 --> 00:35:28.356
straight,
without rest,

00:35:28.356 --> 00:35:31.869
where upon he would draw his
sword and flail as in a battle

00:35:31.869 --> 00:35:33.018
until exhausted.
 

00:35:33.018 --> 00:35:38.827
That is, the return allows us
to learn more about the

00:35:38.827 --> 00:35:44.190
etiology, the origin of Don
Quixote's madness.

00:35:44.190 --> 00:35:47.829
The literary madness is not
sufficient for Cervantes,

00:35:47.829 --> 00:35:52.300
and so he seems to have the
need as--

00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:55.329
remember then I mentioned
Huarte de San Juan's book,

00:35:55.329 --> 00:35:58.394
the doctor that I mentioned,
who wrote Examen de

00:35:58.394 --> 00:36:02.134
ingenios, Cervantes
gives us some details about Don

00:36:02.134 --> 00:36:05.199
Quixote's physical qualities and
all of that,

00:36:05.199 --> 00:36:12.768
that make him prone to madness.
 

00:36:12.768 --> 00:36:14.813
For instance,
his thinness,

00:36:14.813 --> 00:36:18.429
the dryness of his skin,
a dry constitution.

00:36:18.429 --> 00:36:21.014
In the thearious,
humors of the time,

00:36:21.014 --> 00:36:23.097
the &gt;
 

00:36:23.097 --> 00:36:26.474
of the time made him a
candidate for the kind of

00:36:26.474 --> 00:36:28.268
madness that he had.
 

00:36:28.268 --> 00:36:32.190
This is because Cervantes,
unlike Dante,

00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:36.909
whose Divine Comedy is
thoroughly allegorical,

00:36:36.909 --> 00:36:39.949
Cervantes only flirts with
allegory,

00:36:39.949 --> 00:36:41.690
but always seems to avoid it.
 

00:36:41.690 --> 00:36:44.833
What I mean is,
this is not an allegorical

00:36:44.833 --> 00:36:47.331
madman,
this is a particular madman

00:36:47.331 --> 00:36:50.630
with a specific illness,
not an every man who can easily

00:36:50.630 --> 00:36:52.313
be subsumed in the
"we"

00:36:52.313 --> 00:36:54.889
at the beginning of the
Divine Comedy,

00:36:54.889 --> 00:36:57.329
"Nel mezzo del cammin
de nostra vita..."

00:36:57.329 --> 00:37:02.043
'nostra vita,' in the
middle of a journey of our

00:37:02.043 --> 00:37:05.710
lives, this is,
this particular mad man.

00:37:05.710 --> 00:37:09.498
This is why all of these
details about his life at home

00:37:09.498 --> 00:37:11.889
are given,
his diet, and all of that,

00:37:11.889 --> 00:37:15.250
are details Cervantes has given
to justify to his madness.

00:37:15.250 --> 00:37:17.829
It's not just a literary
madness.

00:37:17.829 --> 00:37:22.956
Now, the book burning and the
walling of the library will be

00:37:22.956 --> 00:37:27.557
cures for Don Quixote's madness,
but both are also filled with

00:37:27.557 --> 00:37:29.010
all kinds of implications.
 

00:37:29.010 --> 00:37:34.532
But through both parts of the
novel, the characters will be

00:37:34.532 --> 00:37:38.150
searching for cures for Don
Quixote.

00:37:38.150 --> 00:37:41.742
And here, obviously,
the burning of the books and

00:37:41.742 --> 00:37:45.411
the walling of the library are a
part of the cure:

00:37:45.411 --> 00:37:49.829
you eliminate the source and
you eliminate the illness.

00:37:49.829 --> 00:37:53.039
Now, the inquisition of the
library,

00:37:53.039 --> 00:37:55.976
or the scrutiny of the library
is one of the most famous

00:37:55.976 --> 00:37:59.235
episodes in the Quixote,
and of course one the favorite

00:37:59.235 --> 00:38:01.639
ones of literary critics and
historians,

00:38:01.639 --> 00:38:06.510
because it deals with books.
 

00:38:06.510 --> 00:38:09.661
Again, it is conjecture that
the end of the library episode

00:38:09.661 --> 00:38:13.139
would have been the end of the
novella of Don Quixote,

00:38:13.139 --> 00:38:17.358
if indeed, what Cervantes
proposed to write was a long

00:38:17.358 --> 00:38:22.215
short story about this man who
goes mad from reading too much,

00:38:22.215 --> 00:38:23.250
etcetera.
 

00:38:23.250 --> 00:38:27.146
And then, this novella would
end here, and that would have

00:38:27.146 --> 00:38:27.829
been it.
 

00:38:27.829 --> 00:38:31.885
He wrote many of those short
novellas, he published twelve of

00:38:31.885 --> 00:38:34.425
them in 1613;
he called them Exemplary

00:38:34.425 --> 00:38:35.159
Stories.
 

00:38:35.159 --> 00:38:38.512
It is conjecture,
and you will read it in

00:38:38.512 --> 00:38:43.628
Menéndez Pidal's essay
that this was going to be the

00:38:43.628 --> 00:38:44.969
Quixote.
 

00:38:44.969 --> 00:38:50.679
And that Cervantes took stock
of the fact that the character

00:38:50.679 --> 00:38:56.389
and the situation had great
possibilities and continued from

00:38:56.389 --> 00:38:58.518
then on his novel.
 

00:38:58.518 --> 00:39:04.860
I'll get back to that in a
minute.

00:39:04.860 --> 00:39:12.822
The inquiry of the library is,
of course, a satire of the

00:39:12.822 --> 00:39:15.949
Spanish Inquisition.
 

00:39:15.949 --> 00:39:18.159
This is clear.
 

00:39:18.159 --> 00:39:21.878
The Spanish Inquisition also
forbid books,

00:39:21.878 --> 00:39:24.780
picked up books,
and burnt books,

00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:27.230
so it is a mild satire.
 

00:39:27.230 --> 00:39:33.286
Here the Inquisition is
represented by the niece who's

00:39:33.286 --> 00:39:37.271
nineteen years old,
the housekeeper,

00:39:37.271 --> 00:39:39.940
a village priest,
a barber,

00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:43.099
I mean, these are not exactly
high intellects,

00:39:43.099 --> 00:39:47.710
and the inquisition's officers
were...

00:39:47.710 --> 00:39:51.934
So, this is a satire in
Cervantes, even against menacing

00:39:51.934 --> 00:39:55.929
institutions like the
Inquisition, is always mild.

00:39:55.929 --> 00:40:01.289
It's always mild,
never very bitter.

00:40:01.289 --> 00:40:06.288
Now, details that are somewhat
important about the scrutiny of

00:40:06.288 --> 00:40:09.320
the library is that no book in
it,

00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:13.389
in the library,
was published after 1591,

00:40:13.389 --> 00:40:19.056
so that allows us to surmise
that the Quixote was

00:40:19.056 --> 00:40:21.219
written after 1591.
 

00:40:21.219 --> 00:40:24.996
The chapter is the bibliography
that Cervantes refused to

00:40:24.996 --> 00:40:26.750
provide in the prologue.
 

00:40:26.750 --> 00:40:30.760
Remember when his friend says,
you don't have to,

00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:35.190
you can make it up,
well, this is the bibliography.

00:40:35.190 --> 00:40:38.159
Of course, he couldn't have
given his bibliography in the

00:40:38.159 --> 00:40:41.447
prologue because a bibliography
made up of romances of chivalry

00:40:41.447 --> 00:40:43.568
is not a very authoritative
bibliography,

00:40:43.568 --> 00:40:44.469
as it were.
 

00:40:44.469 --> 00:40:46.719
It's not Aristotle,
Plato and St.

00:40:46.719 --> 00:40:49.885
Thomas Aquinas,
but Amadís de Gaula and

00:40:49.885 --> 00:40:50.800
so forth.
 

00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:56.885
So what he is giving here are
the sources of Don Quixote's

00:40:56.885 --> 00:41:02.329
madness and his protagonist's
literary genealogy.

00:41:02.329 --> 00:41:08.376
This is the family background
that he refuses to provide about

00:41:08.376 --> 00:41:11.349
Don Quixote's 'real family.'
 

00:41:11.349 --> 00:41:13.889
Now, what has Don Quixote read?
 

00:41:13.889 --> 00:41:18.514
Well, chivalric romances,
but also Renaissance epics,

00:41:18.514 --> 00:41:22.429
pastoral romances and some
serious poetry.

00:41:22.429 --> 00:41:26.440
What is missing from this
library?

00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:28.929
Student: Classics?
 

00:41:28.929 --> 00:41:33.659
Prof: Classics and
religious books.

00:41:33.659 --> 00:41:36.260
There are no devotional books
in this library,

00:41:36.260 --> 00:41:39.309
as one will find,
in the library of Diego de

00:41:39.309 --> 00:41:42.445
Miranda,
a character in the second part,

00:41:42.445 --> 00:41:45.409
who says that he has devotional
books.

00:41:45.409 --> 00:41:48.751
Now, of course,
most American readers are

00:41:48.751 --> 00:41:52.429
astonished that there is no
Bible,

00:41:52.429 --> 00:41:56.570
but this is Catholic Spain,
and in Catholic countries,

00:41:56.570 --> 00:41:58.710
we don't read the Bible.
 

00:41:58.710 --> 00:42:02.469
We read devotional books or
hear the Bible in sermons

00:42:02.469 --> 00:42:03.679
from the priests.
 

00:42:03.679 --> 00:42:06.784
So, of course,
if this were a library in New

00:42:06.784 --> 00:42:11.550
England or in Old England there
would have been a Bible,

00:42:11.550 --> 00:42:15.228
but no Bible here at
all, but no devotional books

00:42:15.228 --> 00:42:15.829
either.
 

00:42:15.829 --> 00:42:20.650
What this means is that Alonso
Quixano is a belated humanist,

00:42:20.650 --> 00:42:23.518
that is, a humanist that came
at the end of humanism,

00:42:23.518 --> 00:42:30.559
like Cervantes himself,
a Christian with a weakness for

00:42:30.559 --> 00:42:37.340
frivolous literature but not
very pious or devout.

00:42:37.340 --> 00:42:41.077
Although, it is true,
for a humanist there are no

00:42:41.077 --> 00:42:42.869
classics here either.
 

00:42:42.869 --> 00:42:46.527
There is very little poetry,
although Don Quixote throughout

00:42:46.527 --> 00:42:49.132
the novel seems to know a lot
about poetry,

00:42:49.132 --> 00:42:51.239
and even composes some poetry.
 

00:42:51.239 --> 00:42:54.239
There's nothing by the great
Garcilaso,

00:42:54.239 --> 00:42:58.510
the important Petrarchean style
poet of the sixteenth century in

00:42:58.510 --> 00:43:02.643
Spain who was a model of poets
and to whom Don Quixote alludes

00:43:02.643 --> 00:43:04.000
all of the time.
 

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:05.909
Somehow, it is missing.
 

00:43:05.909 --> 00:43:10.760
This library does not give the
whole range of Cervantes'

00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:14.730
readings or even of Don
Quixote's reading,

00:43:14.730 --> 00:43:19.791
what prevail are the romances
of chivalry about which I spoke

00:43:19.791 --> 00:43:21.480
in the last class.
 

00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:25.755
For Don Quixote they
represented a world of absolute

00:43:25.755 --> 00:43:31.583
values in a fake past and place,
where there is no fissure,

00:43:31.583 --> 00:43:35.480
no break between the
imagination,

00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:38.239
desire and the real.
 

00:43:38.239 --> 00:43:44.302
Now, the fact is that very few
romances of chivalry appeared in

00:43:44.302 --> 00:43:46.159
Spain after 1565.
 

00:43:46.159 --> 00:43:51.349
Cervantes was born in 1547;
this book appears in 1605;

00:43:51.349 --> 00:43:54.590
the action supposedly takes
place in the 1590s.

00:43:54.590 --> 00:43:56.936
So, in this,
Don Quixote is also a bit out

00:43:56.936 --> 00:43:57.679
of fashion.
 

00:43:57.679 --> 00:44:01.539
These romances of chivalry seem
to be all ready out of fashion,

00:44:01.539 --> 00:44:05.601
but things move slowly,
and the fact is that many

00:44:05.601 --> 00:44:10.510
characters in the novel appear
to have read the romances of

00:44:10.510 --> 00:44:15.079
chivalry and to be very
conversant with the romances of

00:44:15.079 --> 00:44:16.349
chivalry.
 

00:44:16.349 --> 00:44:19.411
So, what else do we have?
 

00:44:19.411 --> 00:44:21.739
Pastoral romances.
 

00:44:21.739 --> 00:44:26.659
Pastoral romances were stories
of fake shepherds,

00:44:26.659 --> 00:44:31.597
people who play the role of
shepherds from the eclogues of

00:44:31.597 --> 00:44:36.362
antiquity involved in amorous
adventures in neo-Platonic

00:44:36.362 --> 00:44:40.469
fashion,
going through beautiful natural

00:44:40.469 --> 00:44:45.949
settings that corresponded to
the purity of their love,

00:44:45.949 --> 00:44:47.010
and this, that, and the other.
 

00:44:47.010 --> 00:44:49.090
They could lead to tragic
consequences,

00:44:49.090 --> 00:44:50.956
and this is,
as you will see,

00:44:50.956 --> 00:44:54.159
in the Marcela and
Grisóstomo episode that

00:44:54.159 --> 00:44:55.960
is coming up very soon.
 

00:44:55.960 --> 00:45:00.153
These pastoral romances,
I know, are the furthest away

00:45:00.153 --> 00:45:02.369
from a modern sensibility.
 

00:45:02.369 --> 00:45:06.980
One can imagine a modern
chivalric romance--

00:45:06.980 --> 00:45:09.429
I mentioned,
I talked about James Bond and

00:45:09.429 --> 00:45:11.699
the Fleming movies and all of
that--

00:45:11.699 --> 00:45:15.030
but it's almost impossible to
think of a modern pastoral.

00:45:15.030 --> 00:45:19.349
It's not impossible,
but very improbable.

00:45:19.349 --> 00:45:22.269
But this is one of the roles
that Don Quixote could have

00:45:22.269 --> 00:45:23.704
chosen to play,
and in fact,

00:45:23.704 --> 00:45:27.050
later on in the novel he will
try to become a shepherd too.

00:45:27.050 --> 00:45:30.409
He will think of becoming a
shepherd too.

00:45:30.409 --> 00:45:37.842
Now, whom does Cervantes
surprisingly include among the

00:45:37.842 --> 00:45:42.659
authors in Don Quixote's
library?

00:45:42.659 --> 00:45:50.300
Cervantes himself!
 

00:45:50.300 --> 00:45:53.144
La Galatea,
Jarvis writes,

00:45:53.144 --> 00:45:56.666
Michael de Cervantes:
"...said the barber,

00:45:56.666 --> 00:46:00.106
that Cervantes has been a great
friend of mine these many years

00:46:00.106 --> 00:46:03.436
and I know that he is better
acquainted with misfortunes than

00:46:03.436 --> 00:46:04.380
with poetry.
 

00:46:04.380 --> 00:46:08.099
His book has somewhat of good
invention in it [He's talking

00:46:08.099 --> 00:46:11.690
about Cervantes's pastoral
romance La Galatea].

00:46:11.690 --> 00:46:14.219
He proposes something but
concludes nothing.

00:46:14.219 --> 00:46:17.197
We must wait for the second
part which he promises,

00:46:17.197 --> 00:46:21.130
perhaps on his amendment he may
obtain that entire part..."

00:46:21.130 --> 00:46:23.079
So forth and so on.
 

00:46:23.079 --> 00:46:29.297
So this is a wink of Cervantes
to the reader in which he's

00:46:29.297 --> 00:46:36.280
inviting us to sort of fall in
the same error as Don Quixote,

00:46:36.280 --> 00:46:38.639
blurring literature and reality.
 

00:46:38.639 --> 00:46:41.891
This is what happens when
Cervantes, the author whose name

00:46:41.891 --> 00:46:45.487
is imprinted on the cover of the
book appears within the fiction

00:46:45.487 --> 00:46:48.411
of the book;
the distinction between fiction

00:46:48.411 --> 00:46:50.985
and reality,
between fiction and reality is

00:46:50.985 --> 00:46:54.204
blurred,
and Cervantes is intimating

00:46:54.204 --> 00:47:02.771
that the reading of literature,
in general, can lead to such

00:47:02.771 --> 00:47:04.860
confusion.
 

00:47:04.860 --> 00:47:08.701
All of this,
as I will explain in a minute

00:47:08.701 --> 00:47:12.916
always self referential things
are very funny,

00:47:12.916 --> 00:47:17.039
but they have behind very
serious ideas.

00:47:17.039 --> 00:47:24.394
Now, notice also the irony that
both the priest and the barber

00:47:24.394 --> 00:47:29.579
are steeped in the romances of
chivalry,

00:47:29.579 --> 00:47:32.280
too, they are readers of the
romances of chivalry.

00:47:32.280 --> 00:47:35.413
They know them very well,
they defend some,

00:47:35.413 --> 00:47:39.739
and the priest speaks of having
even begun to write one.

00:47:39.739 --> 00:47:44.829
We will find more readers of
the romances of chivalry and

00:47:44.829 --> 00:47:50.010
more potential writers of
romances of chivalry through the

00:47:50.010 --> 00:47:50.920
novel.
 

00:47:50.920 --> 00:47:56.054
And notice, the elaborate lie
that the niece comes up with to

00:47:56.054 --> 00:48:01.018
explain the disappearance of the
library from the house.

00:48:01.018 --> 00:48:05.326
It is as astonishing a fantasy
as Don Quixote's,

00:48:05.326 --> 00:48:10.824
so maybe it runs in the family:
An old man riding a snake who

00:48:10.824 --> 00:48:13.389
leaves a trail of smoke.
 

00:48:13.389 --> 00:48:19.742
I hope you noticed this
marvelous passage where the

00:48:19.742 --> 00:48:25.711
niece says--well,
the innkeeper says that it was

00:48:25.711 --> 00:48:30.588
a devil that carted it:
"'It was not the devil'

00:48:30.588 --> 00:48:33.878
said the niece,
on page 55, 'but an enchanter,

00:48:33.878 --> 00:48:36.699
who came one night upon a
cloud,

00:48:36.699 --> 00:48:41.074
after the day of your departure
[she's addressing Don Quixote]

00:48:41.074 --> 00:48:43.777
hence,
and alighting from a serpent on

00:48:43.777 --> 00:48:46.380
which he rode,
entered into the room;

00:48:46.380 --> 00:48:49.907
and I know not what he did
there, but after some little

00:48:49.907 --> 00:48:52.652
time, out he came,
flying through the roof,

00:48:52.652 --> 00:48:55.070
and left the house full of
smoke;

00:48:55.070 --> 00:48:58.206
and when we went to see what he
had been doing,

00:48:58.206 --> 00:49:03.052
we saw neither books nor room;
only we very well remember,

00:49:03.052 --> 00:49:06.900
both I and mistress housekeeper
here,

00:49:06.900 --> 00:49:09.230
that when the old thief went
away, he said,

00:49:09.230 --> 00:49:12.257
with a loud voice,
that, for a secret enmity he

00:49:12.257 --> 00:49:15.679
bore to the owner of those books
and of the room,

00:49:15.679 --> 00:49:17.780
he had done a mischief in this
house,

00:49:17.780 --> 00:49:20.800
which should soon be manifest:
he told us also,

00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:24.219
that he was called the sage
Muñatón.'

00:49:24.219 --> 00:49:26.909
Fristón he meant to
say,' quoth Don Quixote."

00:49:26.909 --> 00:49:30.420
Don Quixote,
of course, doesn't question the

00:49:30.420 --> 00:49:35.400
reality, he just questions the
mispronunciation of the name of

00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:36.869
the enchanter.
 

00:49:36.869 --> 00:49:39.239
What does it mean that the
niece should tell this lie?

00:49:39.239 --> 00:49:42.648
The physical disappearance of
the library walled off by the

00:49:42.648 --> 00:49:46.351
housekeeper and the niece is an
instance of the world of reality

00:49:46.351 --> 00:49:49.289
conspiring to increase Don
Quixote's madness,

00:49:49.289 --> 00:49:52.048
and of the uncanny,
the familiar,

00:49:52.048 --> 00:49:56.840
the house,
becoming unfamiliar.

00:49:56.840 --> 00:50:01.175
He came and began looking for
the room, and running his hands

00:50:01.175 --> 00:50:04.210
on the walls and couldn't find
the door.

00:50:04.210 --> 00:50:07.315
It has been said that there is
a contradiction in this action

00:50:07.315 --> 00:50:10.574
of walling off the library when
there are no longer any books in

00:50:10.574 --> 00:50:14.541
it,
but Don Quixote does not know

00:50:14.541 --> 00:50:16.969
this,
and also it would have been

00:50:16.969 --> 00:50:20.456
difficult to explain to him that
the books had been burned or

00:50:20.456 --> 00:50:21.269
given away.
 

00:50:21.269 --> 00:50:22.369
They were burned.
 

00:50:22.369 --> 00:50:26.746
They were his property,
so they have committed a

00:50:26.746 --> 00:50:28.329
punishable act.
 

00:50:28.329 --> 00:50:30.878
The barber, the priest,
the niece and the housekeeper

00:50:30.878 --> 00:50:33.280
are covering their own actions
with a fiction,

00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:37.000
a lie, embellished by the
niece's wild imagination,

00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:41.559
which is contaminated by the
romances of chivalry themselves.

00:50:41.559 --> 00:50:44.255
This reveals,
notice that Cervantes doesn't

00:50:44.255 --> 00:50:47.719
tell us that she's a reader of
romances of chivalry.

00:50:47.719 --> 00:50:51.117
We learn through this speech of
hers that she is a reader of

00:50:51.117 --> 00:50:55.344
romances of chivalry,
and that she suggests that she

00:50:55.344 --> 00:51:00.751
too read these romances probably
sneaking into her uncle's

00:51:00.751 --> 00:51:04.829
library and reading them there
secretly.

00:51:04.829 --> 00:51:09.987
You see how much Cervantes can
suggest without saying it

00:51:09.987 --> 00:51:11.018
directly?
 

00:51:11.018 --> 00:51:15.797
Now, a more significant
contradiction is that while the

00:51:15.797 --> 00:51:19.869
library is walled off and the
books burned,

00:51:19.869 --> 00:51:23.909
the characters continue to
speak to Don Quixote from within

00:51:23.909 --> 00:51:25.789
the fictions of chivalry.
 

00:51:25.789 --> 00:51:29.769
They both cure and make him
more insane, or they try to cure

00:51:29.769 --> 00:51:33.682
him because they realize that he
can only be spoken to from

00:51:33.682 --> 00:51:35.639
within his own mad world.
 

00:51:35.639 --> 00:51:40.097
Claudio Guillén,
a very famous critic,

00:51:40.097 --> 00:51:44.760
who unfortunately passed away
about a year ago,

00:51:44.760 --> 00:51:48.023
says that:
"Don Quixote is enveloped

00:51:48.023 --> 00:51:51.572
by a written context,
a literary genre that reminds

00:51:51.572 --> 00:51:55.309
of chivalry which to him was
historically true,

00:51:55.309 --> 00:51:58.018
structured by potential
adventures that await him

00:51:58.018 --> 00:52:00.172
unforeseen,
but appropriate by virtue of

00:52:00.172 --> 00:52:01.050
that genre."
 

00:52:01.050 --> 00:52:05.449
Because after this Don Quixote
does not read another book,

00:52:05.449 --> 00:52:08.840
he doesn't even read the book
about himself,

00:52:08.840 --> 00:52:13.119
as the character's in Part II,
do--When you get to Part II,

00:52:13.119 --> 00:52:19.045
one of the fun parts of Part II
is that the characters that the

00:52:19.045 --> 00:52:23.059
protagonist encounter have read
Part I,

00:52:23.059 --> 00:52:28.217
and they expect Don Quixote to
act according to how he acted in

00:52:28.217 --> 00:52:31.869
Part I,
but Don Quixote has not read it.

00:52:31.869 --> 00:52:35.552
Alas, Sancho hasn't either,
of course, because he can't

00:52:35.552 --> 00:52:39.780
read--But Don Quixote does not
read another book after this.

00:52:39.780 --> 00:52:44.405
Now, Sancho enters the scene,
he represents European

00:52:44.405 --> 00:52:47.400
peasantry from time immemorial.
 

00:52:47.400 --> 00:52:50.936
Sancho, by the way,
is a very common peasant type

00:52:50.936 --> 00:52:55.429
of name--The only one I can come
up in English is 'Wilbur'.

00:52:55.429 --> 00:52:59.809
I think that a farmer in
English would be called Wilbur.

00:52:59.809 --> 00:53:03.630
I mean, in Snuffy Smith,
remember that comic strip?

00:53:03.630 --> 00:53:06.239
I would imagine someone being
called Wilbur,

00:53:06.239 --> 00:53:08.030
I don't know why,
but that's why I imagine--

00:53:08.030 --> 00:53:10.670
Sancho is a very,
very common name,

00:53:10.670 --> 00:53:20.820
it gives us--Chalk always
eludes me--

00:53:20.820 --> 00:53:23.311
it gives us the last name
'Sánchez' in

00:53:23.311 --> 00:53:25.458
Spanish,
that many of you have heard,

00:53:25.458 --> 00:53:25.976
I'm sure.
 

00:53:25.976 --> 00:53:27.469
'Sánchez'.
 

00:53:27.469 --> 00:53:32.000
In fact, when it has that,
of course, you need the accent.

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:35.512
Spanish names,
that means, 'belonging to the

00:53:35.512 --> 00:53:39.268
family of Sancho,' like
John-son, David-son.

00:53:39.268 --> 00:53:41.768
The 'â€“ez' in Spanish,
'Gonzalo' becomes

00:53:41.768 --> 00:53:44.893
'González,' 'Rodrigo'
becomes 'Rodríguez,'

00:53:44.893 --> 00:53:48.018
'Martín' becomes
'Martínez,' you see?

00:53:48.018 --> 00:53:52.711
I told you were going to learn
tidbits about Spanish culture,

00:53:52.711 --> 00:53:54.119
and there's one.
 

00:53:54.119 --> 00:53:56.596
How Spanish,
not all Spanish last names,

00:53:56.596 --> 00:53:59.389
how this common Spanish last
name, like mine,

00:53:59.389 --> 00:54:00.659
González.
 

00:54:00.659 --> 00:54:03.760
Now, so Sancho, Sánchez.
 

00:54:03.760 --> 00:54:08.626
'Panza' means,
what?

00:54:08.626 --> 00:54:11.059
Belly, gut.
 

00:54:11.059 --> 00:54:18.574
It refers to his eating habits
and to his being very much in

00:54:18.574 --> 00:54:23.159
touch with matter,
with the earth.

00:54:23.159 --> 00:54:25.516
Now, of course,
he represents common sense in

00:54:25.516 --> 00:54:28.302
contrast to Don Quixote's
flights of fancy and I mean

00:54:28.302 --> 00:54:30.820
common sense,
a sense of the common people.

00:54:30.820 --> 00:54:33.280
Whereas Don Quixote is a
voracious reader,

00:54:33.280 --> 00:54:34.659
Sancho is illiterate.
 

00:54:34.659 --> 00:54:38.730
He has in his head all of the
oral lore.

00:54:38.730 --> 00:54:44.422
However, he expresses this
through his 'refranes' or

00:54:44.422 --> 00:54:48.469
proverbs--
as you will see soon--proverbs

00:54:48.469 --> 00:54:53.159
that are the source of folk
wisdom that fascinated

00:54:53.159 --> 00:54:55.958
humanists,
by the way, because they

00:54:55.958 --> 00:54:59.262
thought that the proverbs,
the refranes,

00:54:59.262 --> 00:55:03.190
were a form of common
philosophy of the people,

00:55:03.190 --> 00:55:07.018
and that that philosophy could
potentially contain as much

00:55:07.018 --> 00:55:09.099
wisdom as regular philosophy.
 

00:55:09.099 --> 00:55:10.286
There is the "Book of
Proverbs"

00:55:10.286 --> 00:55:16.358
in the Bible,
and philosophers have used such

00:55:16.358 --> 00:55:20.237
snippets,
like La Roche Foucauld in

00:55:20.237 --> 00:55:23.150
France, in the seventeenth
century,

00:55:23.150 --> 00:55:27.610
who wrote Maximes,
maxims.

00:55:27.610 --> 00:55:30.789
"La vertu n'est ce que le
vice déguisé'.

00:55:30.789 --> 00:55:33.592
Virtue is nothing but vice
disguised,"

00:55:33.592 --> 00:55:36.530
said La Roche Foucauld in his
first maxim.

00:55:36.530 --> 00:55:40.938
Nietzsche wrote such short
snippets, too,

00:55:40.938 --> 00:55:47.329
but these are the common
people's expressions of wisdom.

00:55:47.329 --> 00:55:51.309
Sancho will repeat them over
and over again until he drives

00:55:51.309 --> 00:55:55.699
Don Quixote madder because of
them, he can't take it any more.

00:55:55.699 --> 00:55:59.454
Now, in terms of literary
history, Sancho issues from the

00:55:59.454 --> 00:56:01.534
world of comedy,
of the theater,

00:56:01.534 --> 00:56:04.619
of the picaresque and of
Celestina.

00:56:04.619 --> 00:56:07.534
Some who have wanted to do an
allegorical reading of the

00:56:07.534 --> 00:56:10.842
Quixote see it,
the pair, as an allegory of

00:56:10.842 --> 00:56:13.230
mind and body,
Don Quixote,

00:56:13.230 --> 00:56:15.659
the mind, Sancho the body.
 

00:56:15.659 --> 00:56:20.137
But the most remarkable thing
is that, with his appearance,

00:56:20.137 --> 00:56:24.614
the novel's world becomes one
of dialogue, dialogue between

00:56:24.614 --> 00:56:26.699
Sancho and Don Quixote.
 

00:56:26.699 --> 00:56:30.510
Now, what is most significant
about Sancho--

00:56:30.510 --> 00:56:35.420
and this will become even more
evident in Part II--

00:56:35.420 --> 00:56:38.550
is that, without readings or
refinement,

00:56:38.550 --> 00:56:43.985
he is nevertheless endowed with
sufficient wisdom to live and

00:56:43.985 --> 00:56:46.250
make valuable judgment.
 

00:56:46.250 --> 00:56:48.844
Common sense,
sense of the common people,

00:56:48.844 --> 00:56:51.050
as a sufficient quality of
mind;

00:56:51.050 --> 00:56:55.371
this is a quite modern idea
leading up to democratic and

00:56:55.371 --> 00:56:59.853
egalitarian notions that do not
reach full flier until the

00:56:59.853 --> 00:57:03.389
Enlightenment in the eighteenth
century,

00:57:03.389 --> 00:57:07.849
and in philosopher's like
Rousseau.

00:57:07.849 --> 00:57:12.695
Sancho transcends his
limitations and indeed

00:57:12.695 --> 00:57:17.880
influences his master in his
attitudes and--

00:57:17.880 --> 00:57:20.840
you will see--he engages in
dialogue with Don Quixote and,

00:57:20.840 --> 00:57:25.327
although respectful,
he holds his ground because he

00:57:25.327 --> 00:57:28.289
has sufficient wisdom to do so.
 

00:57:28.289 --> 00:57:35.809
So with Sancho,
the novel seems to be complete,

00:57:35.809 --> 00:57:44.307
the cast is complete,
and the second sally will begin

00:57:44.307 --> 00:57:45.780
here.
 

00:57:45.780 --> 00:57:49.320
And the second sally is where
the Quixote, as we know

00:57:49.320 --> 00:57:50.518
it, really begins.
 

00:57:50.518 --> 00:57:53.989
If it was going to be a short
story and Cervantes extended it

00:57:53.989 --> 00:57:57.108
to become the Quixote,
it is here that the

00:57:57.108 --> 00:57:59.130
Quixote as we know it
begins,

00:57:59.130 --> 00:58:00.880
with Sancho in place.
 

00:58:00.880 --> 00:58:05.012
So, in a sense,
Don Quixote is its own

00:58:05.012 --> 00:58:08.300
source, again,
self legitimation.

00:58:08.300 --> 00:58:12.726
Now, the adventure of the
windmills--I have a little bit

00:58:12.726 --> 00:58:17.313
more--This is a signature
episode of the Quixote as

00:58:17.313 --> 00:58:18.360
you know.
 

00:58:18.360 --> 00:58:20.619
You have seen it everywhere,
represented everywhere.

00:58:20.619 --> 00:58:23.230
You go to the Barajas Airport,
in Madrid,

00:58:23.230 --> 00:58:26.954
and you will find a thousand
little trinkets that you can buy

00:58:26.954 --> 00:58:29.873
with the windmills and Don
Quixote and so forth.

00:58:29.873 --> 00:58:30.369
Why?
 

00:58:30.369 --> 00:58:34.474
It's the first adventure where
the two characters disagree

00:58:34.474 --> 00:58:37.500
about the nature of what is
being seen,

00:58:37.500 --> 00:58:46.114
it is tremendously funny,
it has one of the most

00:58:46.114 --> 00:58:50.068
tremendous,
one of the funniest lines in

00:58:50.068 --> 00:58:51.210
the whole book for me.
 

00:58:51.210 --> 00:58:54.791
When Don Quixote says,
look at those giants and he

00:58:54.791 --> 00:59:01.005
goes on and on about the giants,
and, with a pause that a good

00:59:01.005 --> 00:59:05.865
comic would be able to use,
Sancho says,

00:59:05.865 --> 00:59:08.380
"What giants?"
 

00:59:08.380 --> 00:59:09.760
He doesn't see any giants.
 

00:59:09.760 --> 00:59:12.268
He sees windmills.
 

00:59:12.268 --> 00:59:20.289
So Don Quixote charges,
and with a catastrophic result

00:59:20.289 --> 00:59:22.710
that you know.
 

00:59:22.710 --> 00:59:27.057
Now, there are other things
that are important about this

00:59:27.057 --> 00:59:27.679
scene.
 

00:59:27.679 --> 00:59:33.679
It sets the four-part structure
of most scenes that will follow.

00:59:33.679 --> 00:59:36.369
One, Don Quixote and Sancho see
something;

00:59:36.369 --> 00:59:38.690
two, they argue about what it
is;

00:59:38.690 --> 00:59:43.907
three, Don Quixote takes action;
four, they discuss in the

00:59:43.907 --> 00:59:48.289
aftermath of the adventure what
it was.

00:59:48.289 --> 00:59:54.643
And there is that moment,
also, when Don Quixote says

00:59:54.643 --> 01:00:00.630
something quite profound after
this adventure,

01:00:00.630 --> 01:00:07.900
in trying to explain how the
giants became windmills.

01:00:07.900 --> 01:00:10.940
He says: "'Peace,
friend'--[page 60]--'Peace,

01:00:10.940 --> 01:00:13.360
friend Sancho,' answered Don
Quixote;

01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:16.422
'for matters of war are,
of all others,

01:00:16.422 --> 01:00:20.130
most subject to continual
mutations.'"

01:00:20.130 --> 01:00:24.309
What Don Quixote is saying is
quite profound is that reality

01:00:24.309 --> 01:00:26.010
is in a state of flux.
 

01:00:26.010 --> 01:00:30.077
So things may appear to be
something now and be something

01:00:30.077 --> 01:00:32.039
different a moment later.
 

01:00:32.039 --> 01:00:36.750
So his interpretation is not
foolish at all.

01:00:36.750 --> 01:00:39.630
He also alludes back to the
disappearance of his library,

01:00:39.630 --> 01:00:41.380
I mean, these things can
happen.

01:00:41.380 --> 01:00:46.784
Hey, if my library can
disappear, these giants can

01:00:46.784 --> 01:00:51.530
become windmills and I could be
unseated.

01:00:51.530 --> 01:00:58.143
Now, the next two episodes are
very interesting,

01:00:58.143 --> 01:01:06.163
and one is the fight with what
Jarvis calls the Biscainer,

01:01:06.163 --> 01:01:09.539
a Basque, Biscainer.
 

01:01:09.539 --> 01:01:12.690
These are people from the
Basque country.

01:01:12.690 --> 01:01:19.099
The Basque's occupy parts of
Spain and of France,

01:01:19.099 --> 01:01:23.679
a very proud people because
they presumably were never

01:01:23.679 --> 01:01:25.068
invaded--
First of all,

01:01:25.068 --> 01:01:26.760
they have been there since the
beginning of time;

01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:30.108
their language cannot be traced
back to Indo-European sources,

01:01:30.108 --> 01:01:32.139
they don't know where it came
from.

01:01:32.139 --> 01:01:34.170
They're there,
and the Romans couldn't take

01:01:34.170 --> 01:01:35.664
them over,
and the Arabs couldn't take

01:01:35.664 --> 01:01:37.693
them over,
so they're very proud of that,

01:01:37.693 --> 01:01:40.820
and they're very proud of their
aristocratic background.

01:01:40.820 --> 01:01:42.329
I know about this because my
family,

01:01:42.329 --> 01:01:45.150
most of it, is Basque and
Echevarría is a Basque

01:01:45.150 --> 01:01:49.496
name,
so even today they are a

01:01:49.496 --> 01:01:52.768
frightening people.
 

01:01:52.768 --> 01:01:56.036
There is this group called ETA,
that you may have heard,

01:01:56.036 --> 01:01:56.690
in Spain.
 

01:01:56.690 --> 01:02:02.755
It is a separatist terrorist
group that blows up things and

01:02:02.755 --> 01:02:04.931
kills people,
and so forth,

01:02:04.931 --> 01:02:07.052
and both the Spanish and the
French government have been

01:02:07.052 --> 01:02:08.480
fighting them because the
Basque,

01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:12.480
this group, want autonomy from
Spain and France,

01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:15.380
they want their own country--So
this is the background.

01:02:15.380 --> 01:02:19.869
This is the first of several
characters you're going to meet

01:02:19.869 --> 01:02:23.369
in the book from regions other
than Castile.

01:02:23.369 --> 01:02:28.190
Remember, Spain is made up of
several regions,

01:02:28.190 --> 01:02:31.862
several cultures and languages,
and the Basque are the furthest

01:02:31.862 --> 01:02:35.474
away from other cultures in the
Spanish peninsula because they

01:02:35.474 --> 01:02:37.489
don't have a Roman background.
 

01:02:37.489 --> 01:02:42.469
Their language has nothing to
do with Romance languages,

01:02:42.469 --> 01:02:46.967
and hence he speaks funny,
and part of the humor in this

01:02:46.967 --> 01:02:51.219
episode is the way he speaks
very broken Spanish,

01:02:51.219 --> 01:02:57.329
and how he acts with a sense of
self assurance and haughtiness,

01:02:57.329 --> 01:03:02.079
and so forth,
because he is Basque.

01:03:02.079 --> 01:03:05.295
I am going to stop there and
read just a couple of things

01:03:05.295 --> 01:03:08.567
from the background readings
because I want to speak about

01:03:08.567 --> 01:03:11.954
the lost and found manuscript
and all of that in relation to

01:03:11.954 --> 01:03:15.400
the self reflectiveness in the
novel and all of that,

01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:19.248
and I don't want to do it at
the end when you and I are

01:03:19.248 --> 01:03:19.820
tired.
 

01:03:19.820 --> 01:03:27.811
I wanted you to consider--this
is a way of encouraging you to

01:03:27.811 --> 01:03:32.739
read Elliot Imperial
Spain--

01:03:32.739 --> 01:03:38.498
this contrast that Elliot sets
up here between Castile and

01:03:38.498 --> 01:03:41.244
Aragon:
"The crown of Aragon,

01:03:41.244 --> 01:03:45.115
therefore, with its rich and
energetic urban patriciate was

01:03:45.115 --> 01:03:48.652
deeply influenced by its
overseas commercial interests

01:03:48.652 --> 01:03:50.989
[mostly in the Mediterranean].
 

01:03:50.989 --> 01:03:53.998
It was imbued with a
contractural concept of the

01:03:53.998 --> 01:03:57.389
relationship between kings and
subjects which had been

01:03:57.389 --> 01:04:00.719
effectively realized in
institutional form and it was

01:04:00.719 --> 01:04:04.239
well experienced in the
administration of empire.

01:04:04.239 --> 01:04:06.773
[They still are,
the Catalans are very good

01:04:06.773 --> 01:04:07.679
businessmen].
 

01:04:07.679 --> 01:04:13.405
In all of these respects it
contrasted strikingly with

01:04:13.405 --> 01:04:17.835
medieval Castile [from which
Isabel, came,

01:04:17.835 --> 01:04:20.320
Isabel, the queen].
 

01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:23.742
Where in the early fourteenth
century the crown of Aragon was

01:04:23.742 --> 01:04:27.052
cosmopolitan in outlook and
predominantly mercantile in its

01:04:27.052 --> 01:04:30.313
inclinations,
contemporary Castile tended to

01:04:30.313 --> 01:04:34.789
look inwards,
rather than outwards. [Inwards].

01:04:34.789 --> 01:04:39.199
And was oriented less towards
trade than war.

01:04:39.199 --> 01:04:42.487
Fundamentally,
Castile was a pastoral and

01:04:42.487 --> 01:04:47.420
nomadic society whose habits and
attitudes had been shaped by

01:04:47.420 --> 01:04:50.630
constant warfare,
[against the Moors],

01:04:50.630 --> 01:04:54.409
by the protracted process of
the Reconquista,

01:04:54.409 --> 01:04:57.831
[the re-conquest],
still awaiting completion long

01:04:57.831 --> 01:05:01.610
after it was finished in the
crown of Aragon."

01:05:01.610 --> 01:05:05.896
The point that I want to
suggest here is there's an echo

01:05:05.896 --> 01:05:11.119
of this nomadic war like quality
of Castile in the novel itself,

01:05:11.119 --> 01:05:13.489
where the characters are on the
move.

01:05:13.489 --> 01:05:16.181
Don Quixote and Sancho and all
of the other characters who are

01:05:16.181 --> 01:05:16.800
on the move.
 

01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:22.262
This is a reflection of this
character of Castilian society

01:05:22.262 --> 01:05:25.090
as Elliot describes it here.
 

01:05:25.090 --> 01:05:28.173
This is just to give you an
idea of how productive the

01:05:28.173 --> 01:05:30.559
reading of Elliot can be for
this book.

01:05:30.559 --> 01:05:35.389
The other text that I want to
read is from Manuel

01:05:35.389 --> 01:05:40.320
Durán's essay on the life
of Cervantes,

01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:43.130
that is at the beginning of the
Casebook.

01:05:43.130 --> 01:05:47.699
Now, this is just a very brief
life of Cervantes.

01:05:47.699 --> 01:05:50.800
One cannot go much further,
even though that have been many

01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:53.260
biographies, because there are
no documents.

01:05:53.260 --> 01:05:55.518
There are very few documents to
be found now.

01:05:55.518 --> 01:05:58.721
Of course, there were more,
much more documents in

01:05:58.721 --> 01:06:01.596
Shakespeare's case,
but nothing knew has been

01:06:01.596 --> 01:06:02.250
found.
 

01:06:02.250 --> 01:06:06.867
And I think that what is
important, two things are

01:06:06.867 --> 01:06:10.920
important in what Durán
says here.

01:06:10.920 --> 01:06:13.369
One, he suggests more than says
it,

01:06:13.369 --> 01:06:15.840
Cervantes, I think I've
mentioned this before,

01:06:15.840 --> 01:06:19.335
belongs to the first generation
of writers who are professional

01:06:19.335 --> 01:06:19.900
writers.
 

01:06:19.900 --> 01:06:23.552
Before you had aristocrats and
you had the clergy,

01:06:23.552 --> 01:06:28.099
who could write because they
had the leisure time to do it.

01:06:28.099 --> 01:06:32.969
They were idle readers and
writers.

01:06:32.969 --> 01:06:34.398
Not Cervantes.
 

01:06:34.398 --> 01:06:39.601
Cervantes depends on
aristocrats in the old style of

01:06:39.601 --> 01:06:43.989
the mecenas who gives you
money,

01:06:43.989 --> 01:06:47.699
but it was very unsuccessful
that way and it was very poor,

01:06:47.699 --> 01:06:51.710
and the publishers swindled him
out of money,

01:06:51.710 --> 01:06:54.047
and he was poor,
and he worked,

01:06:54.047 --> 01:06:56.052
and was in jail,
and so forth,

01:06:56.052 --> 01:06:57.500
as you have read in that
statement.

01:06:57.500 --> 01:07:00.188
He was in jail for his accounts
were not too clear in what he

01:07:00.188 --> 01:07:02.340
was doing as a tax collector,
and all of that.

01:07:02.340 --> 01:07:04.969
So these are the first
professional writers.

01:07:04.969 --> 01:07:09.641
And the second point is even
more important,

01:07:09.641 --> 01:07:15.617
which is about how Cervantes
was both inside and outside

01:07:15.617 --> 01:07:17.789
Spanish society.
 

01:07:17.789 --> 01:07:24.690
This is Durán speaking:
"If Cervantes's biography

01:07:24.690 --> 01:07:27.905
teaches us anything,
it is that he was at the same

01:07:27.905 --> 01:07:30.971
time inside and
outside the mainstream of

01:07:30.971 --> 01:07:31.880
Spanish life.
 

01:07:31.880 --> 01:07:36.159
As an insider he took part in
the Battle of Lepanto and wrote

01:07:36.159 --> 01:07:40.152
at least two successful books,
Don Quixote and the

01:07:40.152 --> 01:07:42.150
Exemplary Novels.
 

01:07:42.150 --> 01:07:45.989
This is certainly much more
than the level of achievement of

01:07:45.989 --> 01:07:48.659
most middle-class hidalgos of
his time.

01:07:48.659 --> 01:07:54.172
As an outsider he was always
poor--almost to the point of

01:07:54.172 --> 01:07:58.900
being destitute--and not
infrequently in jail;

01:07:58.900 --> 01:08:03.170
he lacked influential friends
in a society where nothing could

01:08:03.170 --> 01:08:06.039
be done without them and without
money;

01:08:06.039 --> 01:08:10.760
he was often unable to protect
adequately the female members of

01:08:10.760 --> 01:08:12.998
his family;
the influential critics and

01:08:12.998 --> 01:08:15.539
writers of his time did not
recognize the quality of his

01:08:15.539 --> 01:08:17.524
work;
his accomplishments as a

01:08:17.524 --> 01:08:21.221
soldier and as a loyal member of
the Administration were

01:08:21.221 --> 01:08:23.993
ignored--
while his every minor

01:08:23.993 --> 01:08:27.920
transgression was punished
harshly."

01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:32.813
This is a good point about
Cervantes, this figure who's

01:08:32.813 --> 01:08:38.431
both inside and outside society
and hence can provide this deep

01:08:38.431 --> 01:08:40.970
probe into that society.
 

01:08:40.970 --> 01:08:46.000

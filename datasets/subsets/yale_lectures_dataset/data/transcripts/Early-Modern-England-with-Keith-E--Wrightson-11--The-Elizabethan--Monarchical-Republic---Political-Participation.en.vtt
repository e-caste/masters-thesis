00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:03.109
Prof: Okay.
 

00:00:03.109 --> 00:00:06.047
Well, in retrospect,
looking back from the

00:00:06.047 --> 00:00:09.200
perspective of the twenty-first
century,

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.726
the reign of Elizabeth I tends
to shimmer in the historical

00:00:14.726 --> 00:00:16.059
imagination.
 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:18.470
She reigned for forty-five
years;

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.360
she restored political
stability;

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.175
she settled the religious
question at least for the time

00:00:25.175 --> 00:00:27.780
being;
she survived a powerful foreign

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:31.089
enemy,
Spain, and she presided in all

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:35.907
of her iconic splendor over a
brilliant court and the

00:00:35.907 --> 00:00:39.150
flowering of English literature.
 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.970
At the end of her last
Parliament in 1601,

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:47.909
the sixty-eight year old queen
made her Golden Speech,

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:49.680
as it's called.
 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.285
She told the members of the
House of Commons assembled

00:00:53.285 --> 00:00:57.434
before her that they may have
had mightier monarchs but they'd

00:00:57.434 --> 00:01:01.106
had none who had shown greater
care to defend them from

00:01:01.106 --> 00:01:03.984
"peril,
dishonor, tyranny and

00:01:03.984 --> 00:01:06.855
oppression,"
and she expressed her

00:01:06.855 --> 00:01:11.159
confidence that "though God
hath raised me high,

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.471
yet this I count the glory of
my crown that I have reigned

00:01:16.471 --> 00:01:18.709
with your loves."
 

00:01:18.709 --> 00:01:23.117
And she invited each member of
Parliament to come forward and

00:01:23.117 --> 00:01:27.379
kiss her hand before they
departed into their countries.

00:01:27.379 --> 00:01:31.867
And so each member filed
forward to kiss the Queen's hand

00:01:31.867 --> 00:01:35.474
before leaving her,
probably knowing that they

00:01:35.474 --> 00:01:37.879
would never see her again.
 

00:01:37.879 --> 00:01:43.620
Well, this is marvelous stuff,
and she was great at it.

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.760
It's the theater of majesty.
 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:52.167
Generations of historians feel
the urge to bow their knees and

00:01:52.167 --> 00:01:53.940
kiss her hand too.
 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.220
And me too;
I confess it.

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:57.970
&gt;
 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.903
When the present Queen
Elizabeth came to the throne I

00:02:00.903 --> 00:02:03.950
was a little boy in primary
school and our teacher,

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.328
Miss Cranston,
the lady who taught me to

00:02:07.328 --> 00:02:09.907
write,
told us all stories about

00:02:09.907 --> 00:02:13.937
Elizabeth I and said that we
should grow up to be the new

00:02:13.937 --> 00:02:15.990
Elizabethans,
&gt;

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.413
which was a terrible
psychological burden

00:02:17.413 --> 00:02:18.270
&gt;
 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:19.240
&gt;
 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.659
to place on small children.
 

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:24.020
Okay.
 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.348
That's how we tend to look back
on Elizabeth's reign,

00:02:27.348 --> 00:02:29.740
but what we have to remember of
course as historians,

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:34.373
and it's hard to remember,
is that none of this was known

00:02:34.373 --> 00:02:35.449
in advance.
 

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:40.675
It's easy to forget the extent
to which her reign was fraught

00:02:40.675 --> 00:02:44.716
with crises and danger,
especially in its early

00:02:44.716 --> 00:02:48.807
decades, the role of her
servants in surmounting those

00:02:48.807 --> 00:02:53.210
dangers and the subtle shifts
which her long reign brought

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:57.611
about in government and in
political culture and the sheer

00:02:57.611 --> 00:03:01.008
exhausting struggle of so much
of it.

00:03:01.008 --> 00:03:05.429
And these are some of the
things that I want to talk about

00:03:05.429 --> 00:03:06.050
today.
 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:09.917
When Elizabeth came to the
throne on the 17th of November

00:03:09.917 --> 00:03:12.869
1558,
it was another sign of people's

00:03:12.869 --> 00:03:17.436
continued recognition of the
legitimacy and the authority of

00:03:17.436 --> 00:03:18.830
the Tudor line.
 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:23.590
Even her Catholic councilors
readily accepted her accession.

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.370
But the situation was far from
stable, far less stable than it

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.848
had been under Henry VIII for
example.

00:03:29.848 --> 00:03:32.210
And that was evident in various
ways,

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:37.227
not only in the risks posed by
the clear internal divisions in

00:03:37.227 --> 00:03:41.360
matters of religion,
about which I talked last time,

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.976
but also an international
situation of considerable

00:03:44.976 --> 00:03:45.699
danger.
 

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:49.449
England as an ally of Spain was
at war with France.

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:52.878
The city of Calais,
the last English possession on

00:03:52.878 --> 00:03:55.610
the French coast,
had just been lost.

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.580
Elizabeth's cousin,
Mary, Queen of Scots,

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:02.248
then aged only sixteen,
was married to the heir to the

00:04:02.248 --> 00:04:06.264
French throne and she had a
claim to the English throne via

00:04:06.264 --> 00:04:09.848
her grandmother,
Henry VIII's sister.

00:04:09.848 --> 00:04:13.944
That raised the possibility of
a French ambition of uniting

00:04:13.944 --> 00:04:17.899
both Scotland and perhaps
England to the French crown.

00:04:17.899 --> 00:04:21.370
There was at this time a French
army in Scotland supporting

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.601
Mary's mother who was ruling
Scotland in her daughter's

00:04:24.601 --> 00:04:25.319
absence.
 

00:04:25.319 --> 00:04:29.180
That posed a potential threat
from the north.

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.838
Spain was currently an ally
because of Mary's marriage to

00:04:33.838 --> 00:04:36.846
Philip II,
but Spain was also the champion

00:04:36.846 --> 00:04:40.327
of resurgent Catholicism in
Europe and closely identified

00:04:40.327 --> 00:04:43.250
with Mary's Catholic restoration
in England.

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:49.329
So what might Philip II do with
Elizabeth on the throne?

00:04:49.329 --> 00:04:54.600
So the young queen needed
advice, she needed counsel,

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:59.204
and it's the relationship
between Elizabeth and those who

00:04:59.204 --> 00:05:04.468
sought to counsel her that gives
the early and most decisive part

00:05:04.468 --> 00:05:08.579
of her reign its distinctive
political flavor.

00:05:08.579 --> 00:05:11.798
As her sister,
Mary, had approached death late

00:05:11.798 --> 00:05:15.661
in 1558, the nucleus of
Elizabeth's council was already

00:05:15.661 --> 00:05:16.519
forming.
 

00:05:16.519 --> 00:05:21.374
And the central figure amongst
those who advised her was

00:05:21.374 --> 00:05:24.639
William Cecil,
later Lord Burghley.

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:26.920
Now Cecil was a somewhat older
man;

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:28.519
he was in his mid-thirties.
 

00:05:28.519 --> 00:05:31.264
He's nearly always represented
in television and film

00:05:31.264 --> 00:05:34.327
productions about Elizabeth as
an old man but he was in his

00:05:34.327 --> 00:05:36.810
mid-thirties at the beginning of
her reign.

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:40.656
He was to serve the Queen for
no less than forty years and he

00:05:40.656 --> 00:05:44.440
forged a very close and
remarkable partnership with her,

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:49.199
which was truly central to the
Elizabethan regime.

00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:52.675
Traditionally,
he's portrayed as highly

00:05:52.675 --> 00:05:56.057
capable but rather staid,
rather dull,

00:05:56.057 --> 00:06:00.081
perhaps unimaginative,
congenitally cautious,

00:06:00.081 --> 00:06:01.819
a bureaucrat.
 

00:06:01.819 --> 00:06:05.894
But as is increasingly
appreciated, this was far from

00:06:05.894 --> 00:06:07.620
being the whole man.
 

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:12.134
Certainly, he was a very good
servant of the state and he was

00:06:12.134 --> 00:06:17.100
a judicious, deliberative person
and a prodigiously hard worker.

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:21.067
He left behind him masses of
papers, many of them in his own

00:06:21.067 --> 00:06:24.899
hand, which to this day have
never been fully explored.

00:06:24.899 --> 00:06:28.699
He had the habit of working out
decisions which had to be taken

00:06:28.699 --> 00:06:32.560
by setting out the pros and the
cons on any question in lists in

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:35.810
his personal papers as he worked
his way through.

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:39.182
He called this "reasoning
by question upon a matter

00:06:39.182 --> 00:06:41.819
uncertain,"
and it was derived from the

00:06:41.819 --> 00:06:45.009
methods he'd learned in his
classical education.

00:06:45.009 --> 00:06:47.456
But he wasn't simply the
Queen's cautious,

00:06:47.456 --> 00:06:48.589
plodding adviser.
 

00:06:48.589 --> 00:06:52.709
He also had his own ideas and
his own ideals.

00:06:52.709 --> 00:06:57.545
Cecil and some of his closest
colleagues in Elizabeth's first

00:06:57.545 --> 00:07:00.689
council were essentially
Edwardians,

00:07:00.689 --> 00:07:04.697
by which I mean they'd cut
their political teeth in the

00:07:04.697 --> 00:07:09.636
reign of Edward VI as servants,
junior servants at that time,

00:07:09.636 --> 00:07:14.136
of a regime that was governed
by a privy council in the

00:07:14.136 --> 00:07:16.970
absence of an adult male ruler.
 

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:21.291
So Cecil was the Queen's man
but he wasn't just the Queen's

00:07:21.291 --> 00:07:21.740
man.
 

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:25.278
He had a very strong sense of
public service,

00:07:25.278 --> 00:07:28.899
again derived in part from his
classical education,

00:07:28.899 --> 00:07:34.173
and he had a very strong sense
of a state which was independent

00:07:34.173 --> 00:07:36.810
of the person of the monarch.
 

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:41.285
He also explicitly subscribed
to the view that in England

00:07:41.285 --> 00:07:45.841
sovereignty lay not in the crown
alone but in the crown in

00:07:45.841 --> 00:07:47.040
Parliament.
 

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:50.355
He was very keen on the notion
that the consent of the whole

00:07:50.355 --> 00:07:52.646
political nation,
Queen, lords,

00:07:52.646 --> 00:07:58.490
and commons in Parliament,
should be obtained for any

00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:02.079
major political initiative.
 

00:08:02.079 --> 00:08:06.149
A strong sense then of the
state as an entity.

00:08:06.149 --> 00:08:09.165
And secondly Cecil and his
colleagues had an agenda of

00:08:09.165 --> 00:08:12.295
their own, which was essentially
the reestablishment and

00:08:12.295 --> 00:08:14.629
preservation of the Protestant
state.

00:08:14.629 --> 00:08:17.028
He wasn't a dogmatist in
religion.

00:08:17.028 --> 00:08:21.165
He was considerably less
advanced in his religious views

00:08:21.165 --> 00:08:25.149
towards Protestantism than some
of his colleagues,

00:08:25.149 --> 00:08:28.355
but nonetheless he was a
sincere adherent of the

00:08:28.355 --> 00:08:29.310
Reformation.
 

00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:33.908
Indeed, back in 1552 some of
the meetings about the second

00:08:33.908 --> 00:08:38.750
Edwardian prayer book had been
conducted in Cecil's house.

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:42.140
So the importance of this
ideological element,

00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:46.663
this ideological undertone in
the politics of the early reign

00:08:46.663 --> 00:08:49.980
of Elizabeth,
mustn't be underestimated.

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:50.629
Okay then.
 

00:08:50.629 --> 00:08:54.914
Elizabeth's councilors had
certain ideas and certain

00:08:54.914 --> 00:08:59.452
purposes of their own to be
pursued in a very dangerous

00:08:59.452 --> 00:09:00.629
situation.
 

00:09:00.629 --> 00:09:05.451
And finally they had certain
assumptions also about the new

00:09:05.451 --> 00:09:10.440
monarch and about the nature of
their relationship to her.

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:17.980
Obviously, Elizabeth was a
woman, a young unmarried woman,

00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:22.940
and in 1559 shortly after her
accession the Scottish reformer,

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:26.500
John Knox, with quite appalling
timing,

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:30.722
issued a book called The
First Blast of the Trumpet

00:09:30.722 --> 00:09:34.070
Against the Monstrous Regiment
of Women.

00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:38.715
It was an attack upon what
he regarded as the unnatural

00:09:38.715 --> 00:09:42.639
nature of female rule,
the 'regiment of women'.

00:09:42.639 --> 00:09:45.918
This book was directed against
Elizabeth's sister,

00:09:45.918 --> 00:09:49.250
Mary I of England,
and against Mary of Guise,

00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:51.019
the mother of Mary,
Queen of Scots,

00:09:51.019 --> 00:09:54.220
who was ruling Scotland as
regent.

00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:58.211
But by the time it came out it
was deeply embarrassing,

00:09:58.211 --> 00:10:02.500
because it appeared when Mary
had died and Elizabeth was on

00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:03.610
the throne.
 

00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:06.298
One of Elizabeth's bishops,
John Aylmer,

00:10:06.298 --> 00:10:09.028
quickly was recruited to answer
it,

00:10:09.028 --> 00:10:12.729
and he wrote a book called
An Harboowr for Faithful and

00:10:12.729 --> 00:10:15.259
True Subjects to defend her
rule.

00:10:15.259 --> 00:10:18.210
But it was a very odd defense.
 

00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:22.379
He maintained that Elizabeth's
rule posed no threat since,

00:10:22.379 --> 00:10:25.620
to quote him,
"first it is not she that

00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:29.767
ruleth but the laws,"
and secondly "she maketh

00:10:29.767 --> 00:10:33.385
no statutes or laws but in the
honorable court of

00:10:33.385 --> 00:10:35.120
Parliament."
 

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:39.820
Therefore, "what may she
do alone wherein is peril?"

00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:43.509
In short, what he's saying is
that she would not really rule.

00:10:43.509 --> 00:10:47.272
Government would be conducted
in her name and by her royal

00:10:47.272 --> 00:10:50.062
authority,
but the general assumption was

00:10:50.062 --> 00:10:53.220
that she would soon marry
appropriately and in the

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:57.215
meantime the privy council would
assert its role in running the

00:10:57.215 --> 00:11:00.629
country and Parliament would
provide safeguards.

00:11:00.629 --> 00:11:06.929
It's hard to imagine any of
this being written about a male

00:11:06.929 --> 00:11:07.798
ruler.
 

00:11:07.798 --> 00:11:13.125
Well, such expectations showed
that Aylmer didn't really know

00:11:13.125 --> 00:11:18.005
Elizabeth and indeed perhaps
even Cecil didn't yet fully

00:11:18.005 --> 00:11:20.580
appreciate her potential.
 

00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:25.510
She had had a very long
schooling in caution and in the

00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:29.529
avoidance of danger,
but she was also in many

00:11:29.529 --> 00:11:33.639
respects very much her father's
daughter.

00:11:33.639 --> 00:11:37.000
She knew what it was to be a
monarch.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.131
She had an imperious
temperament and she was

00:11:40.131 --> 00:11:44.139
perfectly prepared to assert it
when she was crossed.

00:11:44.139 --> 00:11:49.404
Nor did she intend to allow her
sex to inhibit her in doing

00:11:49.404 --> 00:11:50.038
that.
 

00:11:50.038 --> 00:11:53.754
In 1566, at the age of
thirty-three in response to

00:11:53.754 --> 00:11:58.379
representations made to her by a
parliamentary delegation over

00:11:58.379 --> 00:12:02.408
the succession she stated,
"though I be a woman,

00:12:02.408 --> 00:12:07.785
yet I have as good a courage
answerable to my place as ever

00:12:07.785 --> 00:12:09.269
my father had.
 

00:12:09.269 --> 00:12:11.710
I am your anointed queen.
 

00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:15.750
I will never be constrained to
do anything.

00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:20.609
I thank God I am endued with
such qualities that if I were

00:12:20.609 --> 00:12:25.894
turned out of this realm in my
petticoat I were able to live in

00:12:25.894 --> 00:12:28.879
any place in Christendom."
 

00:12:28.879 --> 00:12:31.500
She could play the gender card
to her own advantage,

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:33.678
and of course she was to do so
many times,

00:12:33.678 --> 00:12:37.994
most famously in her speech to
her troops at Tilbury during the

00:12:37.994 --> 00:12:41.821
Spanish Armada campaign:
"I know I have the body of

00:12:41.821 --> 00:12:46.249
a weak and feeble woman,
but I have the heart and

00:12:46.249 --> 00:12:51.269
stomach of a king and of a king
of England."

00:12:51.269 --> 00:12:53.879
Well, as statements like this
were repeatedly to show,

00:12:53.879 --> 00:12:58.763
she had a great sense of her
own capability and a very strong

00:12:58.763 --> 00:13:03.437
sense of her place as monarch,
and assertions of this kind

00:13:03.437 --> 00:13:07.267
were most likely to come when
she felt that her royal

00:13:07.267 --> 00:13:10.139
authority was being encroached
upon.

00:13:10.139 --> 00:13:15.110
She knew of course that she
ruled under the law,

00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:21.139
but firstly she had no doubt of
her right to the crown.

00:13:21.139 --> 00:13:26.124
She was a monarch ordained by
God and anointed at her

00:13:26.124 --> 00:13:27.370
coronation.
 

00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:32.975
Secondly, she believed that in
her person the imperial kingship

00:13:32.975 --> 00:13:36.048
of Henry VIII had been restored.
 

00:13:36.048 --> 00:13:39.000
She did not regard her supreme
governorship of the Church of

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.600
England as something which had
been granted to her by

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:45.174
Parliament;
rather it had been given to her

00:13:45.174 --> 00:13:49.460
by God and confirmed by
parliamentary statute.

00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:52.345
And thirdly,
she regarded certain 'matters

00:13:52.345 --> 00:13:54.618
of state',
as she termed them,

00:13:54.618 --> 00:13:58.620
as lying ultimately within the
sphere of her 'prerogative

00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:01.408
power': her sole power of
decision,

00:14:01.408 --> 00:14:06.730
her prerogative power,
things to be decided by her.

00:14:06.730 --> 00:14:11.099
And notably they included the
crucial matter of religion,

00:14:11.099 --> 00:14:15.000
foreign policy and the
succession to the throne.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.677
On these matters she would
certainly listen to advice and

00:14:18.677 --> 00:14:21.731
counsel,
but she alone had the last word

00:14:21.731 --> 00:14:26.320
and she strongly believed that
Parliament in particular had no

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:29.330
business in meddling in such
matters.

00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:32.964
As she told that same
parliamentary delegation in 1566

00:14:32.964 --> 00:14:37.009
when they pressured her on the
matter of the succession,

00:14:37.009 --> 00:14:43.543
"it is a strange thing
that the foot should direct the

00:14:43.543 --> 00:14:47.600
head in so weighty a
matter."

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:51.455
All of this considered,
a great deal then would depend

00:14:51.455 --> 00:14:55.456
upon how the Queen and her
councilors would get along in

00:14:55.456 --> 00:14:58.730
handling the central issues of
her reign.

00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:03.538
And on the whole they got along
pretty well.

00:15:03.538 --> 00:15:06.518
On a day-to-day basis,
the privy council ran the

00:15:06.518 --> 00:15:10.510
affairs of government under the
secretaryship first of Cecil and

00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:12.730
then of Sir Francis Walsingham.
 

00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:16.359
Elizabeth would attend council
frequently, but on many days

00:15:16.359 --> 00:15:19.739
they were allowed to simply
proceed with administrative

00:15:19.739 --> 00:15:20.490
matters.
 

00:15:20.490 --> 00:15:24.013
Cecil was given a particularly
free hand in his efforts to

00:15:24.013 --> 00:15:27.413
address the problems of the
commonwealth in economic and

00:15:27.413 --> 00:15:30.129
social affairs,
to plan legislation to be

00:15:30.129 --> 00:15:33.090
brought before Parliament
intended to stabilize and

00:15:33.090 --> 00:15:36.518
strengthen the nation,
some of these things I've

00:15:36.518 --> 00:15:38.029
touched on already.
 

00:15:38.029 --> 00:15:41.279
But what about those vital
'matters of state',

00:15:41.279 --> 00:15:45.759
the really central issues as
far as the Queen was concerned?

00:15:45.759 --> 00:15:48.490
Well, the first order of
business of course was religion,

00:15:48.490 --> 00:15:51.860
the religious settlement,
and as we saw last time there

00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:55.731
was essential unanimity between
Elizabeth and her councilors on

00:15:55.731 --> 00:15:58.979
that issue in shaping the
religious settlement and in

00:15:58.979 --> 00:16:03.149
getting it through Parliament,
though the Queen's personality

00:16:03.149 --> 00:16:06.190
was to become very evident in
the way in which,

00:16:06.190 --> 00:16:11.740
as I described last time,
she set the limits to the

00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:15.850
further reform which might
proceed.

00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:21.407
The issues of foreign policy
and of the succession were much

00:16:21.407 --> 00:16:22.820
more fraught.
 

00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:27.017
And here you've got a pattern,
repeatedly, of pressure being

00:16:27.017 --> 00:16:31.215
brought upon the Queen and of
resistance on her part to such

00:16:31.215 --> 00:16:33.582
pressure;
pressure on her to make

00:16:33.582 --> 00:16:37.035
decisions which her councilors
believed to be absolutely

00:16:37.035 --> 00:16:39.528
crucial,
and on her part a great

00:16:39.528 --> 00:16:43.154
unwillingness to take
categorical decisions which

00:16:43.154 --> 00:16:47.538
might prove to be irreparable
and which might prove to have

00:16:47.538 --> 00:16:49.730
unforeseen consequences.
 

00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:55.105
She was very anxious to avoid
decisions which might lead in

00:16:55.105 --> 00:16:59.000
directions which might prove
disastrous.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.412
So, to look at foreign policy
first of all:

00:17:02.412 --> 00:17:05.094
early in the reign,
in April 1559,

00:17:05.094 --> 00:17:08.750
the war with France was ended
by the Treaty of

00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:10.618
Cateau-Cambresis.
 

00:17:10.618 --> 00:17:14.170
England suffered the
humiliation of losing Calais,

00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:17.078
its last French possession once
and for all,

00:17:17.078 --> 00:17:20.269
but that could be blamed upon
Mary and Philip--

00:17:20.269 --> 00:17:23.490
it had happened under Mary's
reign--

00:17:23.490 --> 00:17:27.606
and there was the positive
benefit of the treaty that the

00:17:27.606 --> 00:17:31.430
peace treaty meant that the
other monarchs recognized

00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:33.930
Elizabeth as Queen of England.
 

00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:36.488
That still left,
however, the problem of

00:17:36.488 --> 00:17:37.210
Scotland.
 

00:17:37.210 --> 00:17:41.583
Scotland was still being ruled
as a French protectorate by Mary

00:17:41.583 --> 00:17:44.663
of Guise,
and then in 1559 Mary,

00:17:44.663 --> 00:17:48.067
Queen of Scots,
became Queen of France when her

00:17:48.067 --> 00:17:52.319
husband,
Francis, acceded to the French

00:17:52.319 --> 00:17:53.308
throne.
 

00:17:53.308 --> 00:17:57.123
To Cecil, the best hope of
achieving security in this

00:17:57.123 --> 00:18:01.303
situation was to encourage
resistance to French domination

00:18:01.303 --> 00:18:03.419
in Scotland,
to encourage,

00:18:03.419 --> 00:18:06.363
in particular,
the resistance of the Scottish

00:18:06.363 --> 00:18:09.840
lords known as the Lords of the
Congregation who were

00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:14.123
Protestants and who were engaged
in what was at that time still a

00:18:14.123 --> 00:18:18.068
largely unsuccessful resistance
to French dominance.

00:18:18.068 --> 00:18:21.878
Elizabeth was willing to go so
far as to act covertly in the

00:18:21.878 --> 00:18:25.381
Scottish situation,
even authorizing the smuggling

00:18:25.381 --> 00:18:27.808
back to Scotland of the
preacher,

00:18:27.808 --> 00:18:32.740
John Knox, in order to stiffen
Scottish Protestant resistance.

00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:38.502
But she was exceedingly
reluctant to intervene openly to

00:18:38.502 --> 00:18:43.220
help any rebels against their
true monarch.

00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:46.182
This time, however,
Cecil managed to persuade her

00:18:46.182 --> 00:18:50.425
because of the obvious threat,
and in 1560 some English troops

00:18:50.425 --> 00:18:54.200
and ships were sent to aid the
Scottish covenanters.

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:56.880
They were not very successful
militarily,

00:18:56.880 --> 00:19:01.459
but in June 1560 Mary of Guise
died and in July the war in

00:19:01.459 --> 00:19:06.440
Scotland was brought to an end
with the Treaty of Edinburgh.

00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:11.986
French troops were evacuated
from Scotland and the Protestant

00:19:11.986 --> 00:19:15.130
lords took control in Edinburgh.
 

00:19:15.130 --> 00:19:20.422
So, that won a breathing space
but it was only a short

00:19:20.422 --> 00:19:23.932
breathing space,
because in December 1560

00:19:23.932 --> 00:19:26.571
Francis II of France,
the young king,

00:19:26.571 --> 00:19:29.048
husband of Mary,
Queen of Scots,

00:19:29.048 --> 00:19:35.420
died, leaving Mary an eighteen
year old widow.

00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:38.160
She returned to Scotland.
 

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:40.901
She accepted the Protestant
settlement which had taken place

00:19:40.901 --> 00:19:42.876
there,
though she was herself a

00:19:42.876 --> 00:19:46.707
Catholic, but she also made
great show soon after her return

00:19:46.707 --> 00:19:50.405
to Scotland of the fact that she
maintained a claim to the

00:19:50.405 --> 00:19:54.940
English throne,
a claim to the succession.

00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:58.933
And this made--this situation
became even worse in the

00:19:58.933 --> 00:20:02.250
mid-1560s, first of all when
Mary married.

00:20:02.250 --> 00:20:04.391
She married Henry,
Lord Darnley,

00:20:04.391 --> 00:20:08.950
who was also descended from the
same Tudor grandmother as Mary,

00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:12.503
Queen of Scots herself by a
second marriage that she

00:20:12.503 --> 00:20:14.719
contracted,
and who also had a distant

00:20:14.719 --> 00:20:15.720
claim to the throne.
 

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:19.834
They married and then in 1566
they had a son,

00:20:19.834 --> 00:20:25.070
James, who was baptized a
Catholic, a potential successor

00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:27.410
to the English crown.
 

00:20:27.410 --> 00:20:31.730
This time the situation was
resolved not by any English

00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:36.048
intervention but by Mary,
Queen of Scots' own errors of

00:20:36.048 --> 00:20:37.088
judgment.
 

00:20:37.088 --> 00:20:42.423
By 1566, she had fallen out of
love disastrously with Lord

00:20:42.423 --> 00:20:43.359
Darnley.
 

00:20:43.359 --> 00:20:47.088
He was a wastrel;
he was a rake;

00:20:47.088 --> 00:20:52.390
he resented deeply his
exclusion from real power.

00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:56.932
In a jealous rage he assisted
in the murder of her secretary,

00:20:56.932 --> 00:20:59.130
David Rizzio,
at one point;

00:20:59.130 --> 00:21:05.858
and in 1567 he was murdered by
a group of Scottish lords

00:21:05.858 --> 00:21:11.855
acting, it was said,
with the covert assistance of

00:21:11.855 --> 00:21:14.670
Queen Mary herself.
 

00:21:14.670 --> 00:21:17.279
With Darnley dead,
Mary embarked upon an

00:21:17.279 --> 00:21:20.358
adulterous affair with Lord
James Bothwell,

00:21:20.358 --> 00:21:22.960
a rather romantic figure,
one of the lords of the

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:26.680
Scottish border area,
with whom she was in love,

00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:32.452
and remained with him until he
managed to obtain a divorce from

00:21:32.452 --> 00:21:36.269
his wife and they married in May
1567.

00:21:36.269 --> 00:21:39.430
All of this was too much for
the Lords of the Congregation;

00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:41.358
they rebelled.
 

00:21:41.358 --> 00:21:45.723
In June 1567,
Mary was forced to abdicate and

00:21:45.723 --> 00:21:51.377
the Earl of Moray took power as
regent for her infant son,

00:21:51.377 --> 00:21:52.368
James.
 

00:21:52.368 --> 00:21:56.730
A year later Mary managed to
escape from her imprisonment in

00:21:56.730 --> 00:22:00.679
Loch Leven Castle but,
having failed to raise adequate

00:22:00.679 --> 00:22:03.318
support to restore her to the
throne,

00:22:03.318 --> 00:22:05.730
she was forced to flee to
England.

00:22:05.730 --> 00:22:10.265
She crossed the border and she
appealed to Elizabeth for help

00:22:10.265 --> 00:22:12.759
in restoring her to the throne.
 

00:22:12.759 --> 00:22:15.883
Well, this was a highly
embarrassing situation,

00:22:15.883 --> 00:22:20.092
and in this situation Elizabeth
and her council had to act very

00:22:20.092 --> 00:22:21.788
circumspectly indeed.
 

00:22:21.788 --> 00:22:24.460
They didn't want to restore
Mary, Queen of Scots to the

00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:27.419
Scottish throne,
because the Scottish--power in

00:22:27.419 --> 00:22:30.988
Scotland was now in the hands of
friendly Lords of the

00:22:30.988 --> 00:22:35.162
Congregation who had proceeded
to bring up the young James as a

00:22:35.162 --> 00:22:36.240
Protestant.
 

00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:40.180
They couldn't let Mary go to
France either.

00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:43.608
If they allowed that,
she might in France reassert

00:22:43.608 --> 00:22:47.670
her claim to the English throne
as well as the Scottish and

00:22:47.670 --> 00:22:51.940
perhaps try to be restored to
Scotland and possibly to England

00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:54.108
with French military aid.
 

00:22:54.108 --> 00:22:57.868
Elizabeth offered to hear both
sides of the story,

00:22:57.868 --> 00:23:01.815
and commissioners met to hear
the charges of murder and

00:23:01.815 --> 00:23:05.905
adultery which were laid by the
Lords of the Congregation

00:23:05.905 --> 00:23:10.288
against Mary and to hear Mary's
countercharges of treason and

00:23:10.288 --> 00:23:13.650
rebellion against her Scottish
subjects.

00:23:13.650 --> 00:23:18.913
And judiciously Elizabeth
eventually determined that the

00:23:18.913 --> 00:23:22.548
case had not been proved either
way.

00:23:22.548 --> 00:23:27.285
Scotland was neutralized--it
was to remain under the rule of

00:23:27.285 --> 00:23:31.858
the Protestant regency--but Mary
could not be released.

00:23:31.858 --> 00:23:36.634
Instead she was held in what
was deemed honorable

00:23:36.634 --> 00:23:41.608
imprisonment in a succession of
English castles.

00:23:41.608 --> 00:23:47.102
So that brought a temporary
resolution to England's

00:23:47.102 --> 00:23:49.931
advantage,
but it also meant that

00:23:49.931 --> 00:23:53.435
Elizabeth was saddled with what
was described as "a

00:23:53.435 --> 00:23:56.558
permanent and lively
danger" in the person of

00:23:56.558 --> 00:23:59.210
Mary,
Queen of Scots.

00:23:59.210 --> 00:24:02.515
She was held in custody,
but as you know,

00:24:02.515 --> 00:24:07.060
almost from the beginning Mary
became the focus of plots

00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:08.880
against Elizabeth.
 

00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:13.500
Indeed, already by 1572,
after the first of these,

00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:16.780
some members of Parliament,
some members of Elizabeth's

00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:18.792
council,
including even some of the

00:24:18.792 --> 00:24:22.444
bishops,
were calling for Mary's head in

00:24:22.444 --> 00:24:25.480
order to resolve this danger.
 

00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:28.088
But Elizabeth wouldn't
countenance that.

00:24:28.088 --> 00:24:31.700
She would not execute an
anointed queen.

00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:36.157
When Parliament asked her to do
so she vetoed the bill that was

00:24:36.157 --> 00:24:39.538
brought before her with the
words "la reine

00:24:39.538 --> 00:24:42.558
s'avisera,"
"the queen will think

00:24:42.558 --> 00:24:44.068
about it."
 

00:24:44.068 --> 00:24:46.589
And she did--for about fifteen
years.

00:24:46.589 --> 00:24:48.358
&gt;
 

00:24:48.358 --> 00:24:50.400
She wouldn't execute an
anointed queen,

00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:54.298
nor would she quietly accede in
Mary's assassination,

00:24:54.298 --> 00:24:58.640
which was also suggested to her
as a way out of the problem.

00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:02.799
Some of her councilors simply
despaired and they were vigilant

00:25:02.799 --> 00:25:05.619
on her behalf,
especially Francis Walsingham,

00:25:05.619 --> 00:25:07.778
the head of her intelligence
service,

00:25:07.778 --> 00:25:12.240
but as yet the Queen would not
budge.

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:17.118
She also refused to budge on
another vital matter,

00:25:17.118 --> 00:25:21.608
the matter of the succession,
and here the tension at the

00:25:21.608 --> 00:25:26.420
very heart of the regime is
perhaps most clearly revealed.

00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:30.662
Initially of course people
expected that Elizabeth would

00:25:30.662 --> 00:25:33.978
soon marry and that she would
bear children,

00:25:33.978 --> 00:25:35.288
bear an heir.
 

00:25:35.288 --> 00:25:39.555
In 1559 to '61,
various candidates were being

00:25:39.555 --> 00:25:41.009
talked about.
 

00:25:41.009 --> 00:25:43.851
Philip II of Spain,
the former husband of her

00:25:43.851 --> 00:25:46.563
sister, Mary,
offered his hand in marriage,

00:25:46.563 --> 00:25:50.048
but that was diplomatically and
politely rejected.

00:25:50.048 --> 00:25:54.614
There was talk of Lord Robert
Dudley as a possible husband but

00:25:54.614 --> 00:25:56.710
there were problems there.
 

00:25:56.710 --> 00:25:58.920
First of all,
he was already married,

00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:03.053
and then in 1560 when his wife
was found dead at the foot of

00:26:03.053 --> 00:26:07.185
the staircase in their country
home there was much suspicion

00:26:07.185 --> 00:26:11.178
that Dudley might have had a
hand in her death in order to

00:26:11.178 --> 00:26:12.578
clear the way.
 

00:26:12.578 --> 00:26:16.359
I think there's little question
that Elizabeth loved Robert

00:26:16.359 --> 00:26:20.076
Dudley, but to marry him would
have been an act of supreme

00:26:20.076 --> 00:26:21.380
political folly.
 

00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:26.105
They considered Prince Eric of
Sweden, but he was rumored to be

00:26:26.105 --> 00:26:27.630
mentally unstable.
 

00:26:27.630 --> 00:26:32.509
They considered the Archduke
Charles of Austria but he was a

00:26:32.509 --> 00:26:33.420
Catholic.
 

00:26:33.420 --> 00:26:35.048
And so it went on.
 

00:26:35.048 --> 00:26:40.911
Nothing had come of all of this
by 1562 and nor would Elizabeth

00:26:40.911 --> 00:26:44.220
name a successor in the
meantime.

00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:48.663
And then in 1562 she nearly
died of smallpox and the

00:26:48.663 --> 00:26:53.368
fragility of the situation was
vividly demonstrated.

00:26:53.368 --> 00:26:56.970
What would happen if she were
to die?

00:26:56.970 --> 00:27:01.440
In 1563 when Parliament met it
almost immediately petitioned

00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:04.848
the Queen to marry and to name a
successor.

00:27:04.848 --> 00:27:08.499
Both the House of Lords and the
House of Commons were involved

00:27:08.499 --> 00:27:12.028
and they were not very discreet
in approaching the Queen.

00:27:12.028 --> 00:27:13.558
The Speaker of the House of
Commons,

00:27:13.558 --> 00:27:15.358
using his privilege of free
speech,

00:27:15.358 --> 00:27:19.271
reminded her of the history of
Alexander the Great and the

00:27:19.271 --> 00:27:23.390
disastrous consequences of his
failure to provide for a clear

00:27:23.390 --> 00:27:24.420
succession.
 

00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:27.573
Almost certainly at this point
the members of Parliament were

00:27:27.573 --> 00:27:30.412
actually being covertly
encouraged by William Cecil and

00:27:30.412 --> 00:27:33.461
the privy council who wanted
pressure put upon the Queen in

00:27:33.461 --> 00:27:36.461
this matter,
but she gave only evasive

00:27:36.461 --> 00:27:40.786
replies and Parliament
eventually gave in and went into

00:27:40.786 --> 00:27:43.828
recess without any definite
result.

00:27:43.828 --> 00:27:46.480
By the time they met again in
1566,

00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:49.029
the situation was even worse
because of Mary,

00:27:49.029 --> 00:27:52.769
Queen of Scots' marriage to
Lord Darnley and her pregnancy,

00:27:52.769 --> 00:27:56.865
and again Parliament was
encouraged to raise the matter

00:27:56.865 --> 00:27:58.990
and did so pretty bluntly.
 

00:27:58.990 --> 00:28:03.153
They declared that they would
not pass any taxation bill

00:28:03.153 --> 00:28:07.470
unless she replied to their
petition of 1563 asking her to

00:28:07.470 --> 00:28:09.058
name a successor.
 

00:28:09.058 --> 00:28:12.921
That was why Elizabeth rebuked
them in the words I've already

00:28:12.921 --> 00:28:16.588
quoted to you for encroaching on
her sovereign rights,

00:28:16.588 --> 00:28:20.026
though she also promised that
she would indeed in good time

00:28:20.026 --> 00:28:23.210
marry;
she intended to.

00:28:23.210 --> 00:28:27.765
When Parliament pushed again by
trying to incorporate that

00:28:27.765 --> 00:28:32.480
verbal promise into one of their
money bills she rejected it

00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:33.440
angrily.
 

00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:39.035
She told them they would not
have dared have treated her

00:28:39.035 --> 00:28:42.422
father thus;
nor indeed would they,

00:28:42.422 --> 00:28:43.759
she was right.
 

00:28:43.759 --> 00:28:47.036
But under the pressures of the
times there had been something

00:28:47.036 --> 00:28:48.730
of a shift in political life.
 

00:28:48.730 --> 00:28:52.386
As Stephen Alford says,
in writing of William Cecil and

00:28:52.386 --> 00:28:55.700
the privy council,
these were men who were

00:28:55.700 --> 00:29:00.057
"redefining their
relationship with a monarch who

00:29:00.057 --> 00:29:04.333
refused to play by the rules of
monarchy and name her

00:29:04.333 --> 00:29:06.058
successor."
 

00:29:06.058 --> 00:29:07.519
The role of the council,
one could say,

00:29:07.519 --> 00:29:12.240
was shifting somewhat from that
of being merely an advisory and

00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:16.430
an executive body to that of
attempting to put political

00:29:16.430 --> 00:29:19.019
pressure on the Queen herself.
 

00:29:19.019 --> 00:29:22.843
And Parliament was taking
something of a novel role in

00:29:22.843 --> 00:29:25.730
calling openly for definite
policies,

00:29:25.730 --> 00:29:30.930
definite courses of action in
matters the Queen regarded as

00:29:30.930 --> 00:29:33.529
solely her own prerogative.
 

00:29:33.529 --> 00:29:37.316
And Parliament was to do it
again very soon in 1572 when it

00:29:37.316 --> 00:29:40.318
called for the head of Mary,
Queen of Scots.

00:29:40.318 --> 00:29:42.950
Sir Francis Knollys,
one of the council,

00:29:42.950 --> 00:29:46.851
told the Queen in 1569,
"it is not possible for

00:29:46.851 --> 00:29:51.440
your majesty's most faithful
councillors to govern your state

00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:56.259
well unless you will resolutely
follow their opinions in weighty

00:29:56.259 --> 00:29:57.788
matters."
 

00:29:57.788 --> 00:30:00.750
There was a ring of compulsion
in that,

00:30:00.750 --> 00:30:04.704
reflecting a rather unfamiliar
set of political assumptions

00:30:04.704 --> 00:30:08.730
about the relationship between
the Queen and her council.

00:30:08.730 --> 00:30:12.933
As Patrick Collinson has put
it, there were "citizens

00:30:12.933 --> 00:30:17.140
concealed within subjects"
in Elizabethan England.

00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:21.670
But whatever her councilors'
views the fact remained that

00:30:21.670 --> 00:30:25.876
Elizabeth was all they had and
she was secure in that

00:30:25.876 --> 00:30:27.009
knowledge.
 

00:30:27.009 --> 00:30:31.299
She knew they depended totally
upon her presence on the throne

00:30:31.299 --> 00:30:34.846
and she stood her ground,
putting them off with what

00:30:34.846 --> 00:30:37.694
Cecil in exasperation described
as "answers

00:30:37.694 --> 00:30:40.059
answerless"
to their pressures;

00:30:40.059 --> 00:30:43.240
answers answerless.
 

00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:47.321
No one can really say when she
decided that she would never

00:30:47.321 --> 00:30:51.334
marry and perhaps she never
actually consciously took that

00:30:51.334 --> 00:30:56.633
decision;
perhaps matters simply drifted

00:30:56.633 --> 00:30:59.410
in that direction.
 

00:30:59.410 --> 00:31:02.676
Any decisive action perhaps
seemed unacceptable at

00:31:02.676 --> 00:31:06.545
particular points in time and
gradually it emerged that she

00:31:06.545 --> 00:31:08.480
would indeed never marry.
 

00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:10.700
It's difficult to believe that
she was very serious,

00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:13.906
for example,
about the marriage negotiations

00:31:13.906 --> 00:31:18.159
which were conducted between
1575 and 1581 with the French

00:31:18.159 --> 00:31:19.798
Duke of Alen�on.
 

00:31:19.798 --> 00:31:24.221
She was by that time in her
late forties and it's unlikely

00:31:24.221 --> 00:31:27.170
that she really took this
seriously.

00:31:27.170 --> 00:31:31.478
But if she conserved her
freedom of action by refusing to

00:31:31.478 --> 00:31:36.095
act on certain critical matters
that was also just prolonging

00:31:36.095 --> 00:31:40.480
what seemed to many of her
councilors to be a never ending

00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:42.788
situation of insecurity.
 

00:31:42.788 --> 00:31:46.743
And that was especially the
case as England's relationship

00:31:46.743 --> 00:31:50.630
with Spain deteriorated into one
of permanent threat,

00:31:50.630 --> 00:31:55.269
particularly after 1567 with
the Dutch Protestant revolt

00:31:55.269 --> 00:31:59.148
against Spanish rule in the
Netherlands and the

00:31:59.148 --> 00:32:04.462
establishment as the result of a
very powerful Spanish army just

00:32:04.462 --> 00:32:06.910
across the narrow seas.
 

00:32:06.910 --> 00:32:11.200
Again Elizabeth declined to act
decisively.

00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:14.868
There were many in her council
who urged her to intervene

00:32:14.868 --> 00:32:17.358
militarily in support of the
Dutch,

00:32:17.358 --> 00:32:20.654
or later as the wars of
religion broke out in France to

00:32:20.654 --> 00:32:23.890
intervene on behalf of the
French Protestant cause.

00:32:23.890 --> 00:32:25.573
Robert Dudley,
now Earl of Leicester,

00:32:25.573 --> 00:32:27.630
was one of those who pressed
her to do so;

00:32:27.630 --> 00:32:29.380
so did Sir Francis Walsingham.
 

00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:34.179
They were frustrated by her
willingness to countenance

00:32:34.179 --> 00:32:37.529
covert assistance to these
rebels,

00:32:37.529 --> 00:32:41.275
to countenance an undeclared
war against Spain being pursued

00:32:41.275 --> 00:32:45.019
by privateers like Sir Francis
Drake in the Spanish-American

00:32:45.019 --> 00:32:49.259
possessions,
but remaining unwilling always

00:32:49.259 --> 00:32:55.788
to openly support any rebels
against their sovereign monarch.

00:32:55.788 --> 00:32:59.075
Well, at this point we can
pause briefly just to consider

00:32:59.075 --> 00:33:02.303
another dimension of the
shifting structure of political

00:33:02.303 --> 00:33:04.663
life,
one that you already have

00:33:04.663 --> 00:33:07.430
discussed or will discuss in
section--

00:33:07.430 --> 00:33:11.045
the way in which under
Elizabeth local government was

00:33:11.045 --> 00:33:15.285
gradually intensifying and an
increasingly direct relationship

00:33:15.285 --> 00:33:19.526
was being built up between the
privy council at the center and

00:33:19.526 --> 00:33:24.182
local justices of the peace,
encouraging an extended form of

00:33:24.182 --> 00:33:28.699
political participation amongst
the gentry elites of the English

00:33:28.699 --> 00:33:29.558
counties.
 

00:33:29.558 --> 00:33:31.248
These were men,
as you know,

00:33:31.248 --> 00:33:34.060
who were very conscious of
their role as local

00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:36.500
representatives of their
counties,

00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:40.250
who pursued that role in their
correspondence with the center

00:33:40.250 --> 00:33:43.750
in their petitions and the
questions they raised in their

00:33:43.750 --> 00:33:46.500
attempts to modify and influence
policy.

00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:50.056
And they were men who were also
at the same time very conscious

00:33:50.056 --> 00:33:53.440
of their place in the national
structures of government,

00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:56.919
above all when they
periodically came up to the

00:33:56.919 --> 00:33:59.338
center to serve in Parliament.
 

00:33:59.338 --> 00:34:04.184
And indeed demand for places in
Parliament was such that the

00:34:04.184 --> 00:34:08.947
number of members of Parliament
was greatly increased under

00:34:08.947 --> 00:34:14.039
Elizabeth from 251 in 1547 to
370 by the end of her reign;

00:34:14.039 --> 00:34:18.000
representation was being
extended.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.349
These things you'll discuss in
section,

00:34:20.349 --> 00:34:24.507
but remember that they also
represent a further development

00:34:24.507 --> 00:34:28.664
of the nature of political
participation under Elizabeth in

00:34:28.664 --> 00:34:32.893
the world outside Westminster
and in Westminster itself when

00:34:32.893 --> 00:34:36.978
those people came up to take
part in Parliament or visited

00:34:36.978 --> 00:34:38.268
the court.
 

00:34:38.268 --> 00:34:43.411
Well, all of these various
strands of the situation came

00:34:43.411 --> 00:34:46.030
together in the mid-1580s.
 

00:34:46.030 --> 00:34:51.090
In 1584, William the Silent,
leader of the Dutch rebels,

00:34:51.090 --> 00:34:52.840
was assassinated.
 

00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:57.275
Spain looked like winning the
war against the Dutch under the

00:34:57.275 --> 00:35:00.159
Duke of Parma,
a brilliant commander.

00:35:00.159 --> 00:35:05.960
If that happened would England
be next on the Spanish agenda?

00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:08.820
This, together with the
discovery of the Throckmorton

00:35:08.820 --> 00:35:13.302
plot against Elizabeth,
provoked in 1584 a movement

00:35:13.302 --> 00:35:17.260
known as the Bond of
Association,

00:35:17.260 --> 00:35:22.190
the circulation and signing of
a public oath by members of the

00:35:22.190 --> 00:35:26.719
political nation that they would
undertake to revenge any

00:35:26.719 --> 00:35:30.599
successful attempt against
Elizabeth's life.

00:35:30.599 --> 00:35:33.885
The Bond of Association was
signed by members of the privy

00:35:33.885 --> 00:35:36.164
council,
by members of the nobility,

00:35:36.164 --> 00:35:38.302
by the gentry,
by many clergy,

00:35:38.302 --> 00:35:41.619
by mayors of cities,
even in some counties right

00:35:41.619 --> 00:35:44.420
down to the level of the leaders
of parishes,

00:35:44.420 --> 00:35:47.949
yeoman farmers,
church wardens and so forth.

00:35:47.949 --> 00:35:52.552
It had probably been designed
by Cecil and Sir Francis

00:35:52.552 --> 00:35:57.677
Walsingham, but it clearly found
massive spontaneous support

00:35:57.677 --> 00:35:58.980
nationwide.
 

00:35:58.980 --> 00:36:03.554
In 1584, they also brought
before Parliament and passed an

00:36:03.554 --> 00:36:07.889
Act for the Surety of the
Queen's Most Royal Person.

00:36:07.889 --> 00:36:13.284
This legislated an obligation
upon the whole nation to take

00:36:13.284 --> 00:36:18.306
revenge and to exclude from
succession anyone guilty of

00:36:18.306 --> 00:36:21.190
plotting Elizabeth's death.
 

00:36:21.190 --> 00:36:24.619
Guess who that was aimed at.
 

00:36:24.619 --> 00:36:29.144
Cecil was also secretly drawing
up contingency plans for what

00:36:29.144 --> 00:36:32.539
would happen if the Queen was
assassinated.

00:36:32.539 --> 00:36:36.920
He'd actually considered such
things as long before as 1563,

00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:40.559
but in the mid-1580s he went
into great detail.

00:36:40.559 --> 00:36:43.592
If the Queen was to die or be
assassinated,

00:36:43.592 --> 00:36:47.780
all officers of the crown were
to remain in their posts.

00:36:47.780 --> 00:36:50.150
That was a constitutional
innovation.

00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:55.440
A council of thirty was to be
chosen to govern the nation.

00:36:55.440 --> 00:37:01.070
Parliament would then be called
to meet and choose a successor.

00:37:01.070 --> 00:37:04.876
In other words,
he was envisaging a kind of

00:37:04.876 --> 00:37:10.317
emergency republic if necessary,
resulting in a parliamentary

00:37:10.317 --> 00:37:12.039
choice of king.
 

00:37:12.039 --> 00:37:15.635
It didn't happen of course,
but it's still quite

00:37:15.635 --> 00:37:16.860
extraordinary.
 

00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:21.827
It shows just how far men like
Cecil were prepared to go,

00:37:21.827 --> 00:37:24.931
if necessary,
in order to secure the

00:37:24.931 --> 00:37:29.190
Protestant regime and national
independence.

00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:33.530
Other factors entered the
situation shortly.

00:37:33.530 --> 00:37:37.876
In 1585, Elizabeth was forced
at last to accept the need for

00:37:37.876 --> 00:37:41.708
direct intervention in the
Netherlands to prevent the

00:37:41.708 --> 00:37:45.836
victory of the Spanish army,
and English troops were sent

00:37:45.836 --> 00:37:49.414
under the Earl of Leicester to
stiffen the resistance of the

00:37:49.414 --> 00:37:49.960
Dutch.
 

00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:53.429
In 1586, following the clear
implication of Mary,

00:37:53.429 --> 00:37:56.489
Queen of Scots in the Babington
plot to kill Elizabeth,

00:37:56.489 --> 00:37:59.639
which may possibly have
involved entrapment,

00:37:59.639 --> 00:38:04.010
Mary, Queen of Scots was at
last sentenced to death.

00:38:04.010 --> 00:38:06.010
Elizabeth signed her death
warrant,

00:38:06.010 --> 00:38:10.286
but then withheld it until the
council acted without her

00:38:10.286 --> 00:38:14.797
permission by dispatching the
death warrant to Fotheringhay

00:38:14.797 --> 00:38:18.219
Castle where Mary was promptly
executed.

00:38:18.219 --> 00:38:22.920
When the news came to London
the Queen was furious.

00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:26.275
She threatened to have the
secretary of the council

00:38:26.275 --> 00:38:30.300
executed and she was probably
serious, but that boil had been

00:38:30.300 --> 00:38:31.039
lanced.
 

00:38:31.039 --> 00:38:35.425
Mary's son, James VI of
Scotland, now age twenty and

00:38:35.425 --> 00:38:40.242
beginning to rule in his own
right, protested against his

00:38:40.242 --> 00:38:42.219
mother's execution.
 

00:38:42.219 --> 00:38:44.929
But he got over it,
&gt;

00:38:44.929 --> 00:38:48.188
knowing full well that being
brought up as a Protestant as he

00:38:48.188 --> 00:38:51.083
had been,
he was very likely to be the

00:38:51.083 --> 00:38:55.090
obvious heir to the English
throne in due course.

00:38:55.090 --> 00:38:59.108
So the reign had reached its
crisis point and it had been

00:38:59.108 --> 00:39:03.559
surmounted by forms of action on
the part of central members of

00:39:03.559 --> 00:39:07.507
the political nation which have
led Patrick Collinson to

00:39:07.507 --> 00:39:11.742
describe all this as evidence of
a kind of "monarchical

00:39:11.742 --> 00:39:14.469
republic,"
as he puts it.

00:39:14.469 --> 00:39:18.619
Well, of course that term is
something of an exaggeration.

00:39:18.619 --> 00:39:21.186
It's rather being playful in
putting it forward for the sake

00:39:21.186 --> 00:39:24.286
of argument,
but it does make a very serious

00:39:24.286 --> 00:39:28.708
point about the changing
structures of political life and

00:39:28.708 --> 00:39:33.054
about what the expanded,
increasingly participating

00:39:33.054 --> 00:39:38.389
political nation was capable of
conceiving of and even of doing;

00:39:38.389 --> 00:39:43.353
their capacity to act in
defense of the state that they

00:39:43.353 --> 00:39:47.489
wanted with or without the
Queen's consent.

00:39:47.489 --> 00:39:49.789
The Queen had stood her ground.
 

00:39:49.789 --> 00:39:53.483
She retained the ultimate power
of decision, but her councilors

00:39:53.483 --> 00:39:55.329
had got what they wanted too.
 

00:39:55.329 --> 00:39:58.309
The crucial decisions had been
made.

00:39:58.309 --> 00:40:01.860
And who's to say that the
delays which Elizabeth had

00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:05.965
forced upon them hadn't done a
great deal to help in getting

00:40:05.965 --> 00:40:08.960
them right when they were
finally made?

00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:12.360
And so for the moment it rested
there.

00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:17.635
The last years of the reign
were focused upon the war with

00:40:17.635 --> 00:40:22.079
Spain and upon a united effort
to sustain it,

00:40:22.079 --> 00:40:25.608
which was a tremendously
debilitating effort given

00:40:25.608 --> 00:40:27.768
England's limited resources.
 

00:40:27.768 --> 00:40:32.023
In 1588, the whole nation was
mobilized as the Spanish Armada

00:40:32.023 --> 00:40:36.349
approached the English coast and
the defeat of the Armada--

00:40:36.349 --> 00:40:40.782
the prevention of its loading
troops from the Netherlands to

00:40:40.782 --> 00:40:43.869
land in England,
and its eventual scattering as

00:40:43.869 --> 00:40:47.025
it made its way back to Spain
around the northern coast of

00:40:47.025 --> 00:40:50.625
Scotland and Ireland--
all of this was regarded as a

00:40:50.625 --> 00:40:54.826
providential deliverance of
England from this tremendous

00:40:54.826 --> 00:40:55.590
threat.
 

00:40:55.590 --> 00:40:57.139
But that providential
deliverance,

00:40:57.139 --> 00:41:01.340
as they saw it,
was followed by a hard slog

00:41:01.340 --> 00:41:05.639
through the 1590s:
the debilitating costs in

00:41:05.639 --> 00:41:10.440
treasure and in men of
maintaining an army in the

00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:14.606
Netherlands,
the costs of facing rebellion

00:41:14.606 --> 00:41:19.219
in Ireland where the Earl of
Tyrone rose against Elizabethan

00:41:19.219 --> 00:41:23.909
authority aided by a Spanish
expeditionary force which landed

00:41:23.909 --> 00:41:25.159
in Ireland.
 

00:41:25.159 --> 00:41:29.804
As the war dragged on,
Elizabeth's older councilors

00:41:29.804 --> 00:41:31.849
gradually died away.
 

00:41:31.849 --> 00:41:34.949
Leicester died in 1588.
 

00:41:34.949 --> 00:41:38.362
She wrote on the last dispatch
she'd received from him,

00:41:38.362 --> 00:41:40.260
"his last letter."
 

00:41:40.260 --> 00:41:42.920
Walsingham died in 1590.
 

00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:46.730
Cecil died in 1598.
 

00:41:46.730 --> 00:41:50.420
The 1590s saw the absolute
pinnacle of the cult of

00:41:50.420 --> 00:41:54.940
Elizabeth as a kind of national
icon represented in the great

00:41:54.940 --> 00:41:57.023
paintings,
the white face,

00:41:57.023 --> 00:42:01.811
the great, elaborate wig,
the magnificent dresses and so

00:42:01.811 --> 00:42:02.530
forth.
 

00:42:02.530 --> 00:42:07.251
But also that period saw heads
gradually turning away from the

00:42:07.251 --> 00:42:10.268
aging Queen and towards the
assumed,

00:42:10.268 --> 00:42:13.559
but as yet formerly undeclared
successor,

00:42:13.559 --> 00:42:16.320
James VI of Scotland.
 

00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:22.570
Court factions began forming,
jockeying for position for when

00:42:22.570 --> 00:42:28.407
James was to succeed,
and when the Queen finally died

00:42:28.407 --> 00:42:33.489
in 1603 somewhat withdrawn,
certain perhaps that her age

00:42:33.489 --> 00:42:37.425
was over,
James entered joyfully upon the

00:42:37.425 --> 00:42:42.018
inheritance for which he had
waited so long.

00:42:42.018 --> 00:42:46.235
But it was to be a rather more
complicated inheritance than

00:42:46.235 --> 00:42:50.449
James appreciated as he rode
south from Edinburgh to become

00:42:50.449 --> 00:42:54.230
not James VI of Scotland but
James I of England.

00:42:54.230 --> 00:42:57.746
It was an inheritance which
contained many concealed

00:42:57.746 --> 00:43:01.815
ambiguities about the nature of
the relationship between the

00:43:01.815 --> 00:43:06.777
crown and the political nation,
about the way power had come to

00:43:06.777 --> 00:43:11.335
be shared and exercised in a
kingdom which remained highly

00:43:11.335 --> 00:43:15.733
centralized under the monarchy
but which also operated a

00:43:15.733 --> 00:43:20.371
political system which was
heavily consultative and in many

00:43:20.371 --> 00:43:22.449
ways participatory.
 

00:43:22.449 --> 00:43:27.193
And an inheritance which was
also ambiguous with regard to

00:43:27.193 --> 00:43:32.438
the purposes which the political
nation expected political power

00:43:32.438 --> 00:43:37.349
to serve if the monarchy was to
retain its legitimacy in the

00:43:37.349 --> 00:43:41.179
eyes of members of the political
nation.

00:43:41.179 --> 00:43:44.539
Before long,
under the early Stuarts,

00:43:44.539 --> 00:43:49.184
some people were beginning to
remember rather ruefully how

00:43:49.184 --> 00:43:53.503
much better things had been in
the time of "Queen

00:43:53.503 --> 00:43:56.193
Elizabeth of blessed
memory,"

00:43:56.193 --> 00:43:58.719
as they tended to put it.
 

00:43:58.719 --> 00:44:01.909
"I will not make windows
into men's souls."

00:44:01.909 --> 00:44:04.362
"I will never be
constrained to do

00:44:04.362 --> 00:44:05.460
anything."
 

00:44:05.460 --> 00:44:08.989
"I have the heart and
stomach of a king."

00:44:08.989 --> 00:44:12.760
"I have reigned with your
loves."

00:44:12.760 --> 00:44:13.699
She had.
 

00:44:13.699 --> 00:44:19.000

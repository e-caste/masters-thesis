00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:03.991
Prof: Incidentally,
in my discussion sections,

00:00:03.991 --> 00:00:05.970
people got too excited about
charisma.

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.250
So we did speak a lot about
charisma.

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:11.940
I ask your patience.
 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.463
We will cover some of the same
grounds, but I hope I can give

00:00:16.463 --> 00:00:18.800
you new jokes about charisma.
 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.434
This is one of the most
exciting features of Weber

00:00:23.434 --> 00:00:26.312
theory,
and probably one of--next to

00:00:26.312 --> 00:00:30.237
the Protestant Ethic,
right?--the one which entered

00:00:30.237 --> 00:00:34.230
the common language,
more than anything else. Right?

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.992
That we all talk about
charisma, and people's charisma,

00:00:37.992 --> 00:00:40.710
or charismatic leaders,
all the time.

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.374
Just like the Protestant work
ethic, which entered the popular

00:00:45.374 --> 00:00:49.733
vocabulary, and everybody who
has not read any Weber still

00:00:49.733 --> 00:00:51.110
uses the term.
 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:59.058
It's also very important to
come to terms with the idea of

00:00:59.058 --> 00:01:06.450
charisma because Weber was
suspected in the 1930s,

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.578
'40s and '50s to be actually a
proto-fascist,

00:01:10.578 --> 00:01:16.126
and with the idea of charisma
advocating for a strong

00:01:16.126 --> 00:01:21.284
leadership for Germany,
a calling for a charismatic

00:01:21.284 --> 00:01:26.671
leader for Germany,
and in a way almost demanding

00:01:26.671 --> 00:01:28.500
Adolph Hitler.
 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.080
Well, of course,
he died in 1920;

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.480
he could not do that.
 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:38.610
But especially the philosopher,
George LukÃ¡cs,

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.830
accused him to be an
irrationalist,

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:50.176
and being a proto-fascist,
laying the ideology for Nazism

00:01:50.176 --> 00:01:52.800
and Adolph Hitler.
 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:59.277
I have to tell you that I am
not absolutely certain what

00:01:59.277 --> 00:02:03.870
Weber would have done in 1930 or
'33.

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:09.507
I hope, like his brother,
he would not have gone for the

00:02:09.507 --> 00:02:11.659
fascists, or Nazis.
 

00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:15.050
But it's complicated.
 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.979
I will try to make a case that
in fact the concept of charisma

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:23.050
is not quite what Adolph Hitler
was.

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:29.908
So the main major themes of the
presentation today.

00:02:29.908 --> 00:02:33.970
First of all we will deal with
the definition of charisma;

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.639
what is charismatic authority.
 

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:43.240
Then we will talk about the
sources of charisma,

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:46.873
where charisma is coming from,
and this is particularly

00:02:46.873 --> 00:02:51.224
important,
to see why Weber is actually

00:02:51.224 --> 00:02:53.460
not a proto-Nazi.
 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:59.133
Then we will be talking about
the followers of the charismatic

00:02:59.133 --> 00:02:59.970
leader.
 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:06.145
Then we will talk about
charisma as a revolutionary

00:03:06.145 --> 00:03:11.210
force, charisma as a vehicle of
change.

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:15.883
And I think this is an
interesting idea in Weber,

00:03:15.883 --> 00:03:21.530
though one of the weaker points
I think of Weber theory.

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:27.802
I think Karl Marx has a much
more coherent and much more

00:03:27.802 --> 00:03:33.393
persuasive theory about
historical change as class

00:03:33.393 --> 00:03:36.065
struggle,
you know, and the

00:03:36.065 --> 00:03:39.800
contradictions between forces
and relations of production.

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:45.365
This is historically
invalidated, but a very coherent

00:03:45.365 --> 00:03:49.538
and very persuasive kind of
argument.

00:03:49.538 --> 00:03:54.795
Weber's idea of charisma as a
revolutionary force actually has

00:03:54.795 --> 00:03:59.018
empirical relevance,
but it's rather unpersuasive,

00:03:59.018 --> 00:04:01.688
and I will talk about this.
 

00:04:01.688 --> 00:04:05.938
And then we come to a big
problem with charisma,

00:04:05.938 --> 00:04:10.691
how charismatic leadership can
be routinized or transmitted

00:04:10.691 --> 00:04:14.050
from a charismatic leader to the
next,

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:19.153
and what are the methods of
succession for a charismatic

00:04:19.153 --> 00:04:19.990
leader.
 

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:25.819
So, I mean, those of you who
were in my discussion sections,

00:04:25.819 --> 00:04:31.057
you can see it will not be just
a regurgitation of the

00:04:31.057 --> 00:04:33.430
discussion sections.
 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:35.819
And I don't know what happened
in other discussion sections;

00:04:35.819 --> 00:04:38.690
also the charisma may have come
up.

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:44.490
This makes people move;
minds move a great deal.

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:50.240
So I'll just step back a minute
and again revisit the idea of

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:54.649
different types of domination
and authority.

00:04:54.649 --> 00:04:59.459
And this is the simplest scheme
I can come up with.

00:04:59.459 --> 00:05:02.329
But I think this is a good one.
 

00:05:02.329 --> 00:05:04.720
I'll copyright it;
I did it.

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.899
&gt;
 

00:05:06.899 --> 00:05:09.329
So the question is where is
obedience due to?

00:05:09.329 --> 00:05:12.762
It can be due to rules,
impersonal rules,

00:05:12.762 --> 00:05:17.740
or it can be due to a personal
master, to an individual.

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:19.750
That's the big story. Right?
 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:23.148
And if it is due to rules,
that's when we are talking

00:05:23.148 --> 00:05:27.952
about legal-rational authority--
and this will be the topic--and

00:05:27.952 --> 00:05:31.862
bureaucratic rule,
modern liberal democratic

00:05:31.862 --> 00:05:35.990
system or modern
not-that-democratic system,

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:44.930
but systems which still do have
rules of law.

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:51.000
There are actually
authoritarian systems which do

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.726
operate with rules of law,
where authoritarian leaders

00:05:56.726 --> 00:06:01.221
actually do themselves follow
the law and take law seriously

00:06:01.221 --> 00:06:03.660
and implement laws seriously.
 

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:10.310
So legal-rational authority
does not mean liberal democracy.

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:16.728
It simply means that this is a
system in which there is a rule

00:06:16.728 --> 00:06:22.620
of law, even if the leader
itself can be not particularly

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:24.199
democratic.
 

00:06:24.199 --> 00:06:31.470
Democracy, as we understand it,
is a very recent phenomenon.

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:37.779
Universal suffrage in the
Western world became widespread

00:06:37.779 --> 00:06:41.930
since the 1920s,
and it really became the

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:47.235
dominant form--
right?--of political rule much,

00:06:47.235 --> 00:06:52.096
much later;
I would say more like after the

00:06:52.096 --> 00:06:54.029
Second World War.
 

00:06:54.029 --> 00:06:56.351
I mean, Switzerland,
for instance,

00:06:56.351 --> 00:06:59.940
gave rights for women to vote
just very recently.

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:04.833
So well, you know,
democracy is a--liberal

00:07:04.833 --> 00:07:09.250
democracy--is a very new
invention.

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:13.670
And legal-rational authority is
not such a new invention.

00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:21.574
There was a rule of law in
England going back to the Orange

00:07:21.574 --> 00:07:23.072
Revolution.
 

00:07:23.072 --> 00:07:24.300
Right?
 

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:32.149
It's going back to the late
seventeenth century.

00:07:32.149 --> 00:07:38.286
There was rule of law in the
United States before the late

00:07:38.286 --> 00:07:42.269
eighteenth and nineteenth
century,

00:07:42.269 --> 00:07:47.122
though there was no liberal
democracy as we understand that.

00:07:47.122 --> 00:07:47.779
Right?
 

00:07:47.779 --> 00:07:50.060
There was no universal suffrage
at all.

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:56.199
So, I mean, you could have rule
of law without democracy.

00:07:56.199 --> 00:07:59.415
But that's still very different
from a system where you obey a

00:07:59.415 --> 00:07:59.889
master.
 

00:07:59.889 --> 00:08:03.300
There are two ways how you obey
a master.

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:07.838
You obey because the tradition
appointed that master--

00:08:07.838 --> 00:08:10.639
and that's what we were talking
about Tuesday--

00:08:10.639 --> 00:08:14.920
or because the master is
believed to have some

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:17.110
charismatic features.
 

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:21.697
I also mentioned it last time:
that the differences between

00:08:21.697 --> 00:08:25.754
the three types of authority--
legal-rational authority,

00:08:25.754 --> 00:08:29.675
traditional authority,
and charismatic authority--do

00:08:29.675 --> 00:08:32.758
not have the same,
I'll use the term,

00:08:32.758 --> 00:08:34.222
ontological status.
 

00:08:34.222 --> 00:08:34.840
Right?
 

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:39.558
The two big forms in history
are traditional authority which

00:08:39.558 --> 00:08:42.840
through rationalization
eventually becomes

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:47.323
legal-rational authority,
and charismatic authority

00:08:47.323 --> 00:08:49.908
usually is a transitory stage.
 

00:08:49.908 --> 00:08:57.821
Charismatic authority is a
charismatic leader emerges in

00:08:57.821 --> 00:09:02.855
times of great need,
desperation and need for

00:09:02.855 --> 00:09:06.985
change, and charismatic leaders,
if they deliver--you know,

00:09:06.985 --> 00:09:09.950
as long as they deliver--
they remain leaders.

00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:14.650
If they stop delivering
charisma is taken away from

00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:15.308
them.
 

00:09:15.308 --> 00:09:19.485
And it is extremely difficult
for a charismatic leader to

00:09:19.485 --> 00:09:23.658
establish an ongoing system of
charismatic authority--

00:09:23.658 --> 00:09:29.618
right?--because it will be very
difficult to transfer their own

00:09:29.618 --> 00:09:33.269
personal charisma to somebody
else--

00:09:33.269 --> 00:09:37.158
right?--and to keep running a
charismatic system.

00:09:37.158 --> 00:09:41.067
Okay, so that's about
generally, you know,

00:09:41.067 --> 00:09:42.879
what is charisma?
 

00:09:42.879 --> 00:09:47.860
As I said, this really we keep
using the term all the time.

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:52.398
The last eighteen months we
used it a lot because of

00:09:52.398 --> 00:09:55.779
candidate and later President
Obama.

00:09:55.779 --> 00:10:01.668
And there is probably nobody in
this room who at one point did

00:10:01.668 --> 00:10:05.820
not say something about Obama's
charisma;

00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:08.721
or, you know,
if you did not like him,

00:10:08.721 --> 00:10:10.682
the lack of his charisma.
 

00:10:10.682 --> 00:10:11.389
Right?
 

00:10:11.389 --> 00:10:15.370
But, you know,
this was a commonly used term.

00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:20.166
Now this is coming from Weber,
because he dug this term out

00:10:20.166 --> 00:10:23.970
from a rather obscure
theological language,

00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:28.745
where charisma actually
referred to some superhuman

00:10:28.745 --> 00:10:34.025
qualities of individuals,
I would say almost semi-gods,

00:10:34.025 --> 00:10:39.779
who have some very personal and
exclusive relationship to God,

00:10:39.779 --> 00:10:42.668
and therefore,
like any other human beings,

00:10:42.668 --> 00:10:47.511
they kind of can talk to God
and then they can interpret

00:10:47.511 --> 00:10:51.658
God's will to the people;
these were charismatic leaders.

00:10:51.658 --> 00:10:56.306
So, in the most classical
definition, charisma refers

00:10:56.306 --> 00:11:01.308
rather to the great founders of
great world religions;

00:11:01.308 --> 00:11:05.342
that's what charisma,
in initial meaning,

00:11:05.342 --> 00:11:06.149
meant.
 

00:11:06.149 --> 00:11:09.590
So Mohammed,
Moses, or Jesus,

00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:14.996
they had charisma,
because they had a special

00:11:14.996 --> 00:11:16.717
access to God.
 

00:11:16.717 --> 00:11:18.070
Right?
 

00:11:18.070 --> 00:11:21.626
Moses got the two tables from
God.

00:11:21.626 --> 00:11:22.490
Right?
 

00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:26.966
He could not see the face of
God but nevertheless got the two

00:11:26.966 --> 00:11:28.308
tables from God.
 

00:11:28.308 --> 00:11:31.924
Nobody else could walk
up--right?--there on the

00:11:31.924 --> 00:11:36.150
mountain and get these tables,
you know, and tell people,

00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:37.908
"This is the law."
 

00:11:37.908 --> 00:11:38.408
Right?
 

00:11:38.408 --> 00:11:40.673
It was only Moses who could.
 

00:11:40.673 --> 00:11:41.240
Right?
 

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:45.993
And Jesus had a very specific
relationship to God.

00:11:45.993 --> 00:11:46.769
Right?
 

00:11:46.769 --> 00:11:49.578
Christian belief,
was even the Son of God,

00:11:49.578 --> 00:11:50.950
embodiment of God.
 

00:11:50.950 --> 00:11:54.702
And undoubtedly,
you know, it is believed by

00:11:54.702 --> 00:11:59.679
Christians that Jesus could
actually convey to us what God

00:11:59.679 --> 00:12:00.989
wants us to do.
 

00:12:00.989 --> 00:12:01.950
Right?
 

00:12:01.950 --> 00:12:05.950
Had this very special unique
charismatic appeal.

00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:11.320
And Mohammed had this special
appeal to God.

00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:15.080
Or if you are Mormon,
then Mr. Smith had this very

00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:18.149
unique--right?--relationship to
God.

00:12:18.149 --> 00:12:22.873
At one point an angel came,
you know, got a new sacred

00:12:22.873 --> 00:12:28.399
book, a continuation of the
Bible, left it with Mr. Smith.

00:12:28.399 --> 00:12:31.605
He translated it,
and when the translation was

00:12:31.605 --> 00:12:34.528
gone, you know,
the angel came and took it

00:12:34.528 --> 00:12:35.168
away.
 

00:12:35.168 --> 00:12:39.840
This was a charisma--right?--a
very specific superhuman;

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:43.697
it did not happen to any other
human being, only to Smith.

00:12:43.697 --> 00:12:44.240
Right?
 

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:49.070
That is the initial notion of
the meaning.

00:12:49.070 --> 00:12:54.222
But now Weber makes it here a
little- kind of a broader

00:12:54.222 --> 00:12:57.663
conception,
and he said--right?--that

00:12:57.663 --> 00:13:02.797
charisma will be applied to a
certain quality of an individual

00:13:02.797 --> 00:13:04.058
personality.
 

00:13:04.058 --> 00:13:09.809
It's important still an
individual who is considered

00:13:09.809 --> 00:13:15.898
extraordinary and treated as
endowed with supernatural,

00:13:15.898 --> 00:13:17.590
superhuman.
 

00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:19.570
This sounds like the original
definition.

00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:23.964
But then he goes on and he
said, "Or at least

00:13:23.964 --> 00:13:27.373
exceptional powers and
qualities."

00:13:27.373 --> 00:13:28.269
Right?
 

00:13:28.269 --> 00:13:33.437
And these are regarded as of
divine origin--that's the

00:13:33.437 --> 00:13:38.019
founders of the great
religion--or exemplary;

00:13:38.019 --> 00:13:40.009
he modifies that. Right?
 

00:13:40.009 --> 00:13:41.620
It can be just exemplary.
 

00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:45.982
You don't have to believe that
this is semi-god or the

00:13:45.982 --> 00:13:47.629
embodiment of God.
 

00:13:47.629 --> 00:13:53.211
You only have to believe that
this is an exemplary being who

00:13:53.211 --> 00:13:58.993
has some exceptional abilities,
exceptional qualities,

00:13:58.993 --> 00:14:06.217
and that will qualify that you
will call somebody a charismatic

00:14:06.217 --> 00:14:10.178
person or a charismatic leader.
 

00:14:10.178 --> 00:14:16.273
Let me also underline one more
term from these quotations which

00:14:16.273 --> 00:14:18.730
is extremely important.
 

00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:24.015
He said the person is
considered to be

00:14:24.015 --> 00:14:31.346
extraordinary and treated
as endowed with superhuman or

00:14:31.346 --> 00:14:34.110
exemplary features.
 

00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:38.399
So--and what I think is
extremely important to see,

00:14:38.399 --> 00:14:42.692
that Weber does not tell us
that this individual is actually

00:14:42.692 --> 00:14:46.879
extraordinary,
that it is actually superhuman.

00:14:46.879 --> 00:14:51.038
In a way it is in the eye of
the beholder.

00:14:51.038 --> 00:14:57.323
It is among the followers who
attribute--right?--to these

00:14:57.323 --> 00:15:00.129
qualities, to somebody.
 

00:15:00.129 --> 00:15:07.220
So in a way charismatic leaders
are being made by the followers.

00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:15.870
Well, and what is the source of
charisma?

00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:20.120
This is now making it even more
clearer and more precise.

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:22.538
It rests in recognition.
 

00:15:22.538 --> 00:15:25.399
You have to recognize it,
charisma.

00:15:25.399 --> 00:15:29.639
So the relationship of charisma
is in the interpersonal

00:15:29.639 --> 00:15:33.879
relationship between the leaders
and the followers,

00:15:33.879 --> 00:15:39.115
and in this interaction is
charisma being created.

00:15:39.115 --> 00:15:39.970
Right?
 

00:15:39.970 --> 00:15:44.535
It is not given by the grace of
lord--right?--to an individual

00:15:44.535 --> 00:15:45.210
person.
 

00:15:45.210 --> 00:15:51.048
It is created by those who are
subjected to authority.

00:15:51.048 --> 00:15:51.928
Right?
 

00:15:51.928 --> 00:15:57.870
And it's also important that
those who follow the charismatic

00:15:57.870 --> 00:16:02.820
leaders are usually seen as
followers or disciples.

00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:03.808
Right?
 

00:16:03.808 --> 00:16:08.660
They have some extraordinary
commitment to this leader.

00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:09.379
Right?
 

00:16:09.379 --> 00:16:15.894
This leader creates excitement
in them, and this excitement,

00:16:15.894 --> 00:16:22.408
what creates the community of
the followers or the community

00:16:22.408 --> 00:16:24.284
of the disciples.
 

00:16:24.284 --> 00:16:25.500
Right?
 

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:32.686
And well this was one of the
reasons why many people in the

00:16:32.686 --> 00:16:39.873
last eighteen months regarded
Barack Obama as a charismatic

00:16:39.873 --> 00:16:43.229
leader,
because he was capable to

00:16:43.229 --> 00:16:46.087
appearing in a crowd,
and moved the

00:16:46.087 --> 00:16:50.030
crowd--right?--create excitement
in the crowd.

00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:50.820
Right?
 

00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:55.727
He created
followers--right?--almost one

00:16:55.727 --> 00:16:59.629
would say disciples,
as such.

00:16:59.629 --> 00:17:03.769
Now but the charisma can be
withdrawn.

00:17:03.769 --> 00:17:07.940
This is again a very important
idea in Weber.

00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:13.759
He said if the proof of success
alludes the leader for too long,

00:17:13.759 --> 00:17:18.099
it is likely that the
charismatic authority will

00:17:18.099 --> 00:17:19.022
disappear.
 

00:17:19.022 --> 00:17:20.038
Right?
 

00:17:20.038 --> 00:17:23.960
So the charismatic leader gives
you--

00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:29.660
right?--promises that it will
produce miracles,

00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:35.126
and then the charismatic leader
does not producing these

00:17:35.126 --> 00:17:41.538
miracles--
right?--he must work miracles,

00:17:41.538 --> 00:17:46.132
said Weber--
then the people withdraw the

00:17:46.132 --> 00:17:49.630
recognition of charisma from the
leader,

00:17:49.630 --> 00:17:55.039
and the master simply becomes a
private person,

00:17:55.039 --> 00:18:01.118
an ordinary person;
it loses its individual appeal.

00:18:01.118 --> 00:18:07.400
Well what is very
important--right?--

00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:13.759
that the charismatic leader has
to promise you miracles--

00:18:13.759 --> 00:18:18.511
right?--has to promise you that
it will deliver something what

00:18:18.511 --> 00:18:20.147
you desperately need.
 

00:18:20.147 --> 00:18:20.848
Right?
 

00:18:20.848 --> 00:18:25.226
Charisma is deeply rooted in
the conditions in the situation

00:18:25.226 --> 00:18:29.381
in which a charismatic leader is
being constructed by the

00:18:29.381 --> 00:18:30.420
followers.
 

00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:35.484
When you are in a desperate
need, then you are looking for a

00:18:35.484 --> 00:18:40.205
charismatic leader which can
solve this problem what you

00:18:40.205 --> 00:18:43.038
think is almost unresolvable.
 

00:18:43.038 --> 00:18:47.884
Then the charismatic leader
will come and will promise you

00:18:47.884 --> 00:18:51.824
that this problem,
that the charismatic leader

00:18:51.824 --> 00:18:55.961
will be able to solve,
because of its extraordinary

00:18:55.961 --> 00:18:57.308
characteristics.
 

00:18:57.308 --> 00:19:02.920
And again if I can come back
again to the last elections,

00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:05.338
that was, you know,
clearly the case,

00:19:05.338 --> 00:19:15.920
the way how candidate Obama was
capable to win the elections.

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:22.314
You remember one of the key
words--right?--which

00:19:22.314 --> 00:19:28.163
characterized the campaign:
hope, change,

00:19:28.163 --> 00:19:30.750
yes we can.
 

00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:34.565
I mean, these are very typical
elements--right?--of a

00:19:34.565 --> 00:19:35.959
charismatic appeal.
 

00:19:35.959 --> 00:19:36.618
Right?
 

00:19:36.618 --> 00:19:39.111
You are in need,
you want hope,

00:19:39.111 --> 00:19:43.845
you want to have business as
not usual, you want to have a

00:19:43.845 --> 00:19:48.163
new type of business,
now this is what I promise you.

00:19:48.163 --> 00:19:49.160
Right?
 

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:52.538
Change and hope,
and I empower you.

00:19:52.538 --> 00:19:55.029
I am the person who can empower
you.

00:19:55.029 --> 00:19:55.599
Right?
 

00:19:55.599 --> 00:19:58.029
It can be done. Right?
 

00:19:58.029 --> 00:19:59.599
We can do it. Right?
 

00:19:59.599 --> 00:20:02.019
Yes, it can be done.
 

00:20:02.019 --> 00:20:05.598
Hope, change, yes can be done.
 

00:20:05.598 --> 00:20:09.228
These are very typical
elements--right?--what a

00:20:09.228 --> 00:20:11.910
charismatic leader does produce.
 

00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:16.200
In recent history other
charismatic leaders,

00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:21.300
which are probably not as
attractive in historical

00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:25.905
perspective as Obama,
did become charismatic leaders

00:20:25.905 --> 00:20:26.890
the same way.
 

00:20:26.890 --> 00:20:31.028
Fidel Castro established
charisma for himself.

00:20:31.028 --> 00:20:35.529
The Cuban society was in
desperate need for change in

00:20:35.529 --> 00:20:39.336
1960, and Fidel Castro appealed,
and he said,

00:20:39.336 --> 00:20:42.970
"Well I will bring change
to you.

00:20:42.970 --> 00:20:46.960
I will get rid of this corrupt
government.

00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:49.690
I will create equality."
 

00:20:49.690 --> 00:20:50.349
Right?
 

00:20:50.349 --> 00:20:51.769
"I will help the poor.
 

00:20:51.769 --> 00:20:53.088
The poor will get wealthier.
 

00:20:53.088 --> 00:20:55.213
I will create affluence."
 

00:20:55.213 --> 00:20:55.710
Right?
 

00:20:55.710 --> 00:20:58.238
"I will create a just and
affluent society."

00:20:58.238 --> 00:20:58.618
Right?
 

00:20:58.618 --> 00:21:02.971
And therefore he came up with
promises what people were

00:21:02.971 --> 00:21:08.130
looking for, and then charisma
was attributed to Fidel Castro.

00:21:08.130 --> 00:21:13.002
Adolph Hitler emerged as a
charismatic leader.

00:21:13.002 --> 00:21:13.868
Right?
 

00:21:13.868 --> 00:21:19.210
Germany suffered a humiliating
defeat in the First World War.

00:21:19.210 --> 00:21:23.057
Then it was hit with a Great
Depression, which hit Germany

00:21:23.057 --> 00:21:25.960
even worse than it hit the
United States.

00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:31.448
And then Adolph Hitler
appealed, though he was not

00:21:31.448 --> 00:21:36.598
quite as an attractive
personality as Obama;

00:21:36.598 --> 00:21:38.500
he was, you know,
quite a ridiculous guy.

00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:40.719
But he actually said,
"Well I can solve the

00:21:40.719 --> 00:21:41.805
problems for you."
 

00:21:41.805 --> 00:21:42.230
Right?
 

00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:45.555
Defined an enemy;
"It's all Jewish

00:21:45.555 --> 00:21:46.328
conspiracy.
 

00:21:46.328 --> 00:21:50.368
We get rid of the Jews,
and I will turn things around.

00:21:50.368 --> 00:21:53.548
And, you know,
we will have a new

00:21:53.548 --> 00:21:55.038
empire."
 

00:21:55.038 --> 00:21:58.838
And there he was capable with
this problem.

00:21:58.838 --> 00:22:02.233
There was a need in the
situation where people were

00:22:02.233 --> 00:22:06.165
looking for leadership,
and they were looking for a

00:22:06.165 --> 00:22:08.898
strong leader,
a charismatic leader,

00:22:08.898 --> 00:22:12.349
and they attributed this
charismatic leadership--

00:22:12.349 --> 00:22:14.380
people to them.
 

00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:17.048
The problem comes when they
cannot deliver.

00:22:17.048 --> 00:22:20.942
Certainly Hitler,
when the Russian troops were

00:22:20.942 --> 00:22:26.132
already fighting around Berlin,
was no charismatic leader any

00:22:26.132 --> 00:22:26.738
longer.
 

00:22:26.738 --> 00:22:27.690
Right?
 

00:22:27.690 --> 00:22:31.900
He was hiding in the bunker,
considering suicide,

00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:35.700
and his charisma was gone all
together,

00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:39.779
because he did not deliver,
he did not do the miracles--

00:22:39.779 --> 00:22:44.529
right?--and therefore his
charisma was withdrawn.

00:22:44.529 --> 00:22:49.720
Now about the followers. Right?
 

00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:55.368
He said the followers of a
charismatic leader are often

00:22:55.368 --> 00:23:00.704
bound together by emotional
ties, and they create an

00:23:00.704 --> 00:23:04.890
emotional community with each
other.

00:23:04.890 --> 00:23:11.710
Weber uses the German term
Vergemeinschaftung;

00:23:11.710 --> 00:23:14.450
they become kind of a community.
 

00:23:14.450 --> 00:23:18.500
There is a real religious
leader with a charismatic

00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:19.230
appeal.
 

00:23:19.230 --> 00:23:23.338
It creates always communities
of people.

00:23:23.338 --> 00:23:27.586
I don't know if any one of you
ever had experiences of some

00:23:27.586 --> 00:23:30.369
fundamentalist religious
experience.

00:23:30.369 --> 00:23:32.538
I did when I was a teenager.
 

00:23:32.538 --> 00:23:35.953
There was a
preacher--interestingly,

00:23:35.953 --> 00:23:39.369
he also did not look
charismatic;

00:23:39.369 --> 00:23:41.470
he was even not a great speaker.
 

00:23:41.470 --> 00:23:45.251
I don't know how on earth he
had this curious charismatic

00:23:45.251 --> 00:23:46.630
appeal;
but he did.

00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:48.730
He did have an impact on me.
 

00:23:48.730 --> 00:23:51.118
I attributed charisma to him.
 

00:23:51.118 --> 00:23:55.657
And he kind of created a
community around himself.

00:23:55.657 --> 00:23:56.400
Right?
 

00:23:56.400 --> 00:24:00.152
We all were brothers and
sisters together,

00:24:00.152 --> 00:24:04.818
who kind of believed in the
charismatic preacher.

00:24:04.818 --> 00:24:09.765
This is very often in kind of
sectarian, fundamentalist

00:24:09.765 --> 00:24:12.788
religious groups,
be it Christian,

00:24:12.788 --> 00:24:16.358
or be it Muslim,
be it Evangelical.

00:24:16.358 --> 00:24:20.798
There must be people in this
room--right?--who at least when

00:24:20.798 --> 00:24:23.507
they were teenagers experienced
that.

00:24:23.507 --> 00:24:24.259
Right?
 

00:24:24.259 --> 00:24:28.027
When you are a teenager and you
want to get out of your family,

00:24:28.027 --> 00:24:30.578
and you are looking for a new
community;

00:24:30.578 --> 00:24:35.490
I mean, this kind of religious
community is very often offered

00:24:35.490 --> 00:24:36.858
an alternative.
 

00:24:36.858 --> 00:24:40.890
And some of you may still be in
such a community.

00:24:40.890 --> 00:24:43.190
And if you are, I envy you.
 

00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:45.625
I think it is--you know,
as I recall,

00:24:45.625 --> 00:24:48.670
it was a wonderful experience
in some ways.

00:24:48.670 --> 00:24:50.930
Vergemeinschaftung.
 

00:24:50.930 --> 00:24:53.078
You had your family. Right?
 

00:24:53.078 --> 00:24:56.660
You have your spiritual family
where you belong to.

00:24:56.660 --> 00:24:59.048
Does it make any sense what I'm
saying?

00:24:59.048 --> 00:25:02.336
I think there must be
people--right?--who experience

00:25:02.336 --> 00:25:04.464
that or are still experiencing
it.

00:25:04.464 --> 00:25:05.108
Right?
 

00:25:05.108 --> 00:25:09.210
So that's what he calls
Vergemeinschaftung.

00:25:09.210 --> 00:25:13.910
Gemeinschaft means
community--when the mass society

00:25:13.910 --> 00:25:18.608
relationships becomes a
relationships like a community.

00:25:18.608 --> 00:25:23.096
And indeed, even in charismatic
political campaign,

00:25:23.096 --> 00:25:28.124
you have this sense that we
belong together in the common

00:25:28.124 --> 00:25:28.662
cause.
 

00:25:28.662 --> 00:25:29.650
Right?
 

00:25:29.650 --> 00:25:32.202
There was
Vergemeinschaftung in the

00:25:32.202 --> 00:25:35.548
Civil Rights Movement--
right?--where there were these

00:25:35.548 --> 00:25:38.393
charismatic leaders,
Martin Luther King,

00:25:38.393 --> 00:25:42.932
Bobby Kennedy--right?--
and the whole idea of civil

00:25:42.932 --> 00:25:44.990
rights,
and that we're called

00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:47.890
together--right?--
and we go to the South and we

00:25:47.890 --> 00:25:50.817
demonstrate--
right?--and we demand civil

00:25:50.817 --> 00:25:53.247
rights from these bloody
racists.

00:25:53.247 --> 00:25:53.930
Right?
 

00:25:53.930 --> 00:25:56.921
That created a sense of
community among

00:25:56.921 --> 00:26:00.700
people--right?--who had this
belief in change.

00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:14.670
Well and if you are actually in
such a community,

00:26:14.670 --> 00:26:20.269
you have a kind of personal
devotion to the leader,

00:26:20.269 --> 00:26:26.239
and there is a certain degree
of enthusiasm what emerges in

00:26:26.239 --> 00:26:30.378
you--
right?--which is occasionally

00:26:30.378 --> 00:26:36.080
coming out of despair,
that you are desperate and then

00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:41.067
you hope to have some salvation,
some solution to an

00:26:41.067 --> 00:26:45.710
irresolvable problem by the
charismatic leader.

00:26:45.710 --> 00:26:51.234
That's how in Communism
charismatic leaders like Lenin

00:26:51.234 --> 00:26:53.840
or Mao or Castro emerged.
 

00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:54.779
Right?
 

00:26:54.779 --> 00:26:57.798
These were all societies in
deep trouble,

00:26:57.798 --> 00:27:02.263
after humiliations,
after wars, in big need for

00:27:02.263 --> 00:27:08.193
some major structural change,
and then they were looking for

00:27:08.193 --> 00:27:11.952
a savior--
right?--who will solve these

00:27:11.952 --> 00:27:17.108
irresolvable problems and will
lead out to paradise.

00:27:17.108 --> 00:27:20.269
Well it's also interesting
that, you know,

00:27:20.269 --> 00:27:24.472
in charismatic communities
there is usually relatively

00:27:24.472 --> 00:27:27.925
little hierarchy,
not all that much of a

00:27:27.925 --> 00:27:29.028
bureaucracy.
 

00:27:29.028 --> 00:27:36.134
Those who are actually serving
the charismatic leader usually

00:27:36.134 --> 00:27:40.160
do not get salaries or benefits.
 

00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:43.989
It's again true,
you know, even for charismatic

00:27:43.989 --> 00:27:47.901
political leaders,
that they get a whole army of

00:27:47.901 --> 00:27:51.204
volunteers;
because they so strongly

00:27:51.204 --> 00:27:56.598
believe in the cause that they
volunteer their time and money.

00:27:56.598 --> 00:28:05.180
Well here comes an interesting
and disturbing proposition--

00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:08.814
that he said,
"Well because charisma is

00:28:08.814 --> 00:28:13.468
such an extraordinary form,
it's--as a system of

00:28:13.468 --> 00:28:19.273
charismatic authority--
it is opposed to a rational and

00:28:19.273 --> 00:28:22.327
bureaucratic authority."
 

00:28:22.327 --> 00:28:23.170
Right?
 

00:28:23.170 --> 00:28:28.339
Therefore it is kind of
irrational, in the sense of

00:28:28.339 --> 00:28:32.578
being foreign to all established
rules.

00:28:32.578 --> 00:28:36.230
Because what is a charismatic
leader about?

00:28:36.230 --> 00:28:37.529
To change.
 

00:28:37.529 --> 00:28:41.986
And the change means that there
will be new rules of the game,

00:28:41.986 --> 00:28:46.588
and you don't know exactly what
these rules of the games are.

00:28:46.588 --> 00:28:51.364
And this is what makes,
if the charismatic authority as

00:28:51.364 --> 00:28:56.492
a whole system is operating,
a high level of uncertainty to

00:28:56.492 --> 00:28:57.818
the system.
 

00:28:57.818 --> 00:29:01.598
And now forget about American
politics.

00:29:01.598 --> 00:29:06.638
Because in the United States we
clearly have a legal-rational

00:29:06.638 --> 00:29:11.509
system--right?--that's what
characterizes the United States

00:29:11.509 --> 00:29:12.769
of America.
 

00:29:12.769 --> 00:29:18.506
And occasionally we see
emerging politicians who

00:29:18.506 --> 00:29:24.118
actually do implement some level
of change--

00:29:24.118 --> 00:29:27.096
or promise change,
whether they can deliver or

00:29:27.096 --> 00:29:29.826
not--
will greatly affect how long we

00:29:29.826 --> 00:29:32.240
attach charisma to these people.
 

00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:39.143
But from Roosevelt to JFK to
Martin Luther King to Obama,

00:29:39.143 --> 00:29:45.798
there were politicians with
this charismatic appeal.

00:29:45.798 --> 00:29:48.268
But the system itself was not
charismatic.

00:29:48.268 --> 00:29:48.750
Right?
 

00:29:48.750 --> 00:29:54.880
Charisma helped leaders to get
elected, and charisma actually

00:29:54.880 --> 00:30:01.113
may help a leader to be able to
make some strong and important

00:30:01.113 --> 00:30:03.769
changes early in life.
 

00:30:03.769 --> 00:30:08.002
Those who are critical of
President Obama usually are

00:30:08.002 --> 00:30:11.592
critical of him,
that he has not moving fast and

00:30:11.592 --> 00:30:14.832
forcefully enough--
was not cashing in,

00:30:14.832 --> 00:30:19.598
in his charisma early--
right?--in his presidency.

00:30:19.598 --> 00:30:23.670
And there is,
you know, some signs that in

00:30:23.670 --> 00:30:26.450
fact, you know,
his charisma,

00:30:26.450 --> 00:30:29.528
charismatic appeal is
weakening.

00:30:29.528 --> 00:30:30.720
Right?
 

00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:34.339
There are some people who say,
"Well I feel betrayed.

00:30:34.339 --> 00:30:35.250
You know?
 

00:30:35.250 --> 00:30:40.093
I was promised change,
and I see a lot of politics as

00:30:40.093 --> 00:30:42.048
usual." Right?
 

00:30:42.048 --> 00:30:47.000
So this is, of course,
an inevitable problem,

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:52.298
if a leader who has this
charismatic appeal finds itself

00:30:52.298 --> 00:30:55.670
in the legal-rational
authority--

00:30:55.670 --> 00:30:59.089
right?--where actually it's
very difficult to implement a

00:30:59.089 --> 00:30:59.640
change.
 

00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:03.702
You want to change the rules,
the laws, you have to go

00:31:03.702 --> 00:31:05.848
through Congress to do that.
 

00:31:05.848 --> 00:31:06.538
Right?
 

00:31:06.538 --> 00:31:10.836
You just cannot declare that
from now onwards there is a new

00:31:10.836 --> 00:31:12.730
game, rules of the game.
 

00:31:12.730 --> 00:31:17.400
And that is--sounds very much
like politics as usual.

00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:22.741
That's very different from what
Lenin or Mao Zedong did.

00:31:22.741 --> 00:31:23.519
Right?
 

00:31:23.519 --> 00:31:26.630
Lenin and Mao Zedong were not
guided by rules.

00:31:26.630 --> 00:31:28.828
They established the rules.
 

00:31:28.828 --> 00:31:32.645
I mean, Mao Zedong is a
particularly interesting

00:31:32.645 --> 00:31:33.459
character.
 

00:31:33.459 --> 00:31:34.190
Right?
 

00:31:34.190 --> 00:31:38.295
He established first a
bureaucratic rule in China,

00:31:38.295 --> 00:31:41.981
and then he launches the
Cultural Revolution.

00:31:41.981 --> 00:31:42.818
Right?
 

00:31:42.818 --> 00:31:45.720
He launches an
anti-bureaucratic movement,

00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:49.075
and the top leader of the
bureaucracy is becoming the

00:31:49.075 --> 00:31:52.690
major popular leader of an
anti-bureaucratic movement.

00:31:52.690 --> 00:31:56.923
I mean, this guy was really
quite something,

00:31:56.923 --> 00:31:59.088
quite extraordinary.
 

00:31:59.088 --> 00:32:01.990
And in a way he did that,
you know, because his charisma

00:32:01.990 --> 00:32:03.519
was weakening by the 1960s.
 

00:32:03.519 --> 00:32:06.660
First he promised "a great
leap forward";

00:32:06.660 --> 00:32:09.819
you know, in no time we will
catch up and we will look like

00:32:09.819 --> 00:32:10.910
the United States.
 

00:32:10.910 --> 00:32:13.880
And what happened with the
great leap forward?

00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:17.450
Disaster;
people were starving to death.

00:32:17.450 --> 00:32:20.460
So he was not delivering the
miracle.

00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:23.078
So what does he does next?
 

00:32:23.078 --> 00:32:29.410
He shows as his--we'll change
the rules of the game.

00:32:29.410 --> 00:32:33.438
He launches the Cultural
Revolution, and he suddenly

00:32:33.438 --> 00:32:38.730
becomes the leader of people who
actually should be opposing him.

00:32:38.730 --> 00:32:43.029
You know, he's generating these
kind of miracles;

00:32:43.029 --> 00:32:47.282
you know, the last miracle what
he's trying to generate at old

00:32:47.282 --> 00:32:50.769
age, that he goes swimming in
the Yangtze River.

00:32:50.769 --> 00:32:51.670
You see?
 

00:32:51.670 --> 00:32:53.368
You think I'm old and I'm dying?
 

00:32:53.368 --> 00:32:57.836
No, I'm superhuman,
I still can swim.

00:32:57.836 --> 00:32:58.828
Right?
 

00:32:58.828 --> 00:33:04.393
This is the kind of--trying to
rescue--right?--your charismatic

00:33:04.393 --> 00:33:09.240
appeal, where it is about to be
taken away from you.

00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:13.020
But on the whole,
as we see, as they establish,

00:33:13.020 --> 00:33:17.296
these charismatic leaders,
establish this charismatic

00:33:17.296 --> 00:33:20.420
system, they can change the
rules.

00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:23.047
And, you know,
if you look at Chinese history,

00:33:23.047 --> 00:33:26.026
every five years everything is
completely different.

00:33:26.026 --> 00:33:26.608
Right?
 

00:33:26.608 --> 00:33:30.068
First a hundred flowers
flourish.

00:33:30.068 --> 00:33:32.932
We will let--everybody
will--then, you know,

00:33:32.932 --> 00:33:35.142
great leap forward;
then, you know,

00:33:35.142 --> 00:33:36.279
Cultural Revolution.
 

00:33:36.279 --> 00:33:38.548
He's changing the rules all the
time.

00:33:38.548 --> 00:33:40.680
This is an unpredictable
environment.

00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:45.640
Can the economy work in this
unpredictable environment?

00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:47.200
No, it cannot.
 

00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:50.939
The same goes for the Nazis,
and the same goes for the

00:33:50.939 --> 00:33:51.714
Stalinists.
 

00:33:51.714 --> 00:33:52.348
Right?
 

00:33:52.348 --> 00:33:53.759
It was an unpredictable
environment.

00:33:53.759 --> 00:33:55.808
It was not good for business.
 

00:33:55.808 --> 00:33:59.451
Business needs a predictable
environment.

00:33:59.451 --> 00:34:00.180
Right?
 

00:34:00.180 --> 00:34:03.140
It needs the rule of law.
 

00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:08.217
That's why capitalism--business
at least---likes legal-rational

00:34:08.217 --> 00:34:09.199
authority.
 

00:34:09.199 --> 00:34:13.945
They don't necessarily like
democratic system.

00:34:13.945 --> 00:34:14.789
Right?
 

00:34:14.789 --> 00:34:19.780
Capitalism can live nicely with
authoritarian figures.

00:34:19.780 --> 00:34:23.456
Capitalists loved Pinochet.
 

00:34:23.456 --> 00:34:24.409
Right?
 

00:34:24.409 --> 00:34:26.739
But, you know,
Pinochet was,

00:34:26.739 --> 00:34:30.880
you know, reasonable
legal-rational authority;

00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:33.289
I mean, at the beginning,
you know, he was killing people

00:34:33.289 --> 00:34:33.849
like crazy.
 

00:34:33.849 --> 00:34:37.518
But then he established a
reasonably predictable system

00:34:37.518 --> 00:34:40.358
and capitalists loved it,
and for awhile,

00:34:40.358 --> 00:34:44.447
you know, the Chilean economy,
partially advised by Milton

00:34:44.447 --> 00:34:47.260
Friedman,
you know, boosted.

00:34:47.260 --> 00:34:50.900
So, I mean, what capitalism
really wants is a predictable

00:34:50.900 --> 00:34:51.809
environment.
 

00:34:51.809 --> 00:34:54.771
And in many ways,
you know, democracy is not all

00:34:54.771 --> 00:34:57.480
that good for a predictable
environment,

00:34:57.480 --> 00:35:01.210
because every fourth year we go
to the polls and then we elect

00:35:01.210 --> 00:35:03.509
other people,
and then they come up with

00:35:03.509 --> 00:35:06.159
other ideas,
and this is a bit of a mess.

00:35:06.159 --> 00:35:12.737
So really I would almost say
that a good free market economy

00:35:12.737 --> 00:35:17.096
loves rule of law,
with a kind of authoritarian

00:35:17.096 --> 00:35:20.480
leader and a longstanding
political stability.

00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:23.646
They don't like these big
changes--right?--in the

00:35:23.646 --> 00:35:24.900
political system.
 

00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:31.230
Well now and charisma as a
revolutionary force.

00:35:31.230 --> 00:35:32.650
This is very important.
 

00:35:32.650 --> 00:35:36.880
I think Weber first of all
makes a very specific argument.

00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:40.076
He said it is always in
traditionalistic

00:35:40.076 --> 00:35:44.911
periods--right?--traditional
authority, when charisma is the

00:35:44.911 --> 00:35:47.369
great revolutionary force.
 

00:35:47.369 --> 00:35:50.224
So, in fact,
in a modern legal-rational

00:35:50.224 --> 00:35:54.282
authority, it is not so much
charisma which carries the

00:35:54.282 --> 00:35:55.710
change through.
 

00:35:55.710 --> 00:36:00.556
It is technical innovation,
and it is the kind of routine

00:36:00.556 --> 00:36:05.750
and boring elections every four
years which brings changes by

00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:08.518
gradually and incrementally.
 

00:36:08.518 --> 00:36:12.414
The big change is occurring
from one type of traditional

00:36:12.414 --> 00:36:15.389
authority to another type of
authority,

00:36:15.389 --> 00:36:18.708
and in order to change the
value system of one type of

00:36:18.708 --> 00:36:21.340
tradition to another type of
tradition,

00:36:21.340 --> 00:36:24.000
that's when you need
charismatic leaders.

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:26.724
So he
said--right?--bureaucratic

00:36:26.724 --> 00:36:31.210
rationalization is the major
revolutionary force.

00:36:31.210 --> 00:36:34.900
But, you know,
in a bureaucratic system like

00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:38.590
what we have,
it is really a revolution from

00:36:38.590 --> 00:36:39.619
without.
 

00:36:39.619 --> 00:36:42.329
It is coming from technological
change.

00:36:42.329 --> 00:36:44.280
We have revolution.
 

00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:45.429
Oh yes.
 

00:36:45.429 --> 00:36:51.516
I mean, the first time when I
heard there is stuff like

00:36:51.516 --> 00:36:55.010
internet--email--it was 1976.
 

00:36:55.010 --> 00:37:01.289
And now I'm an email addict,
as many of you know.

00:37:01.289 --> 00:37:03.635
You send me an email,
and occasionally in five

00:37:03.635 --> 00:37:06.818
minutes you get an answer from
me, because I'm always checking

00:37:06.818 --> 00:37:08.070
my email like crazy.
 

00:37:08.070 --> 00:37:09.449
This was all new.
 

00:37:09.449 --> 00:37:11.010
This was coming from the
outside.

00:37:11.010 --> 00:37:14.929
Now, charisma,
on the other hand--this is very

00:37:14.929 --> 00:37:20.070
insightful, very important--it
is revolution from within.

00:37:20.070 --> 00:37:24.775
What charisma is doing is
changing the value systems in

00:37:24.775 --> 00:37:25.125
you.
 

00:37:25.125 --> 00:37:25.909
Right?
 

00:37:25.909 --> 00:37:30.150
That's what charismatic leaders
do achieve, to persuade you that

00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:33.650
you have to have a different
kind of value system.

00:37:33.650 --> 00:37:37.429
And that's why I think
charismatic leadership does play

00:37:37.429 --> 00:37:40.510
a role, not only in traditional
societies.

00:37:40.510 --> 00:37:46.335
But charismatic leaders,
in a legal-rational authority,

00:37:46.335 --> 00:37:51.623
do play a role to change
people's value systems in

00:37:51.623 --> 00:37:53.889
substantial ways.
 

00:37:53.889 --> 00:37:57.579
Again we discussed that in
discussion sections.

00:37:57.579 --> 00:38:01.190
Those who are not in my
discussion sections--just let me

00:38:01.190 --> 00:38:03.293
invoke the Civil Rights
Movement.

00:38:03.293 --> 00:38:03.949
Right?
 

00:38:03.949 --> 00:38:07.130
The Civil Rights Movement in
ten years,

00:38:07.130 --> 00:38:10.047
in the United States,
produced a change in value

00:38:10.047 --> 00:38:12.371
systems--
our attitudes to race

00:38:12.371 --> 00:38:15.579
relationships and gender
relationships--

00:38:15.579 --> 00:38:19.547
which otherwise would have
taken a hundred years.

00:38:19.547 --> 00:38:20.210
Right?
 

00:38:20.210 --> 00:38:25.141
It happened in ten short years,
that we completely rethought

00:38:25.141 --> 00:38:28.903
race and gender relationships in
this country.

00:38:28.903 --> 00:38:29.739
Right?
 

00:38:29.739 --> 00:38:34.697
And this to a large extent
demanded--right?--charismatic

00:38:34.697 --> 00:38:35.599
leaders.
 

00:38:35.599 --> 00:38:40.492
It demanded--right?--Martin
Luther King--right?--who had a

00:38:40.492 --> 00:38:45.643
dream--right?--about a society
where there can be a different

00:38:45.643 --> 00:38:47.789
type of value system.
 

00:38:47.789 --> 00:38:51.197
And in no time--I mean,
you were too young to

00:38:51.197 --> 00:38:53.722
experience that,
but your parents and

00:38:53.722 --> 00:38:56.346
grandparents experienced it,
and talk to them,

00:38:56.346 --> 00:39:00.065
they will tell you--
right?--how fundamentally their

00:39:00.065 --> 00:39:04.449
world outlook and looking at a
person of another race,

00:39:04.449 --> 00:39:09.989
or how they began to treat
women in their family,

00:39:09.989 --> 00:39:13.389
or girls in their family,
how radically it changed,

00:39:13.389 --> 00:39:15.789
almost instantly. Right?
 

00:39:15.789 --> 00:39:18.451
Because it was a change from
within.

00:39:18.451 --> 00:39:19.059
Right?
 

00:39:19.059 --> 00:39:22.880
That's what charismatic
revolution is all about.

00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:30.644
And well this is,
of course has everything to do

00:39:30.644 --> 00:39:33.619
against routine.
 

00:39:33.619 --> 00:39:37.929
Charismatic is not doing
things as they used to be.

00:39:37.929 --> 00:39:41.340
That's why it is the
opposite--right?--of one type of

00:39:41.340 --> 00:39:44.358
traditionalism,
and the problem is what happens

00:39:44.358 --> 00:39:47.639
if the charismatic leader
disappears and dies?

00:39:47.639 --> 00:39:51.920
And that's when we have the
problem how can the charismatic

00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:53.469
leader be replaced?
 

00:39:53.469 --> 00:39:58.369
It's a very big issue,
and there are different methods

00:39:58.369 --> 00:39:59.849
of succession.
 

00:39:59.849 --> 00:40:02.920
And let me just walk you
through of this.

00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:05.530
It's not quite uninteresting.
 

00:40:05.530 --> 00:40:07.320
It can be search.
 

00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:09.768
It can be by revelation.
 

00:40:09.768 --> 00:40:14.139
It can be designation by the
original leader.

00:40:14.139 --> 00:40:18.753
It can be designation by a
staff, which is particularly

00:40:18.753 --> 00:40:24.050
qualified to decide who the next
charismatic leader will be.

00:40:24.050 --> 00:40:28.827
The issue is how can you
maintain a charismatic system

00:40:28.827 --> 00:40:29.820
going on?
 

00:40:29.820 --> 00:40:33.701
It can be hereditary,
that some hereditary line is

00:40:33.701 --> 00:40:34.809
established.
 

00:40:34.809 --> 00:40:39.795
And it can be office charisma;
the office itself can carry

00:40:39.795 --> 00:40:40.590
charisma.
 

00:40:40.590 --> 00:40:43.980
Now let me just briefly talk to
each one of these.

00:40:43.980 --> 00:40:45.489
Search.
 

00:40:45.489 --> 00:40:53.326
Well the best example is how
you find a Dalai Lama.

00:40:53.326 --> 00:40:54.579
Right?
 

00:40:54.579 --> 00:40:56.510
It happens through a search.
 

00:40:56.510 --> 00:40:59.018
The Dalai Lama dies.
 

00:40:59.018 --> 00:41:04.170
You know that the Dalai Lama is
reincarnated.

00:41:04.170 --> 00:41:08.617
So you send out people and
looking for a child who is the

00:41:08.617 --> 00:41:11.320
reincarnation of the Dalai Lama.
 

00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:15.646
There must be just one child
who is the reincarnation of the

00:41:15.646 --> 00:41:16.599
Dalai Lama.
 

00:41:16.599 --> 00:41:19.782
And then you have experts,
who can tell,

00:41:19.782 --> 00:41:23.210
go around and then they find
this child.

00:41:23.210 --> 00:41:28.016
This is the new Dalai Lama,
and then it will be brought up,

00:41:28.016 --> 00:41:31.746
and will become the Dalai Lama
and, of course,

00:41:31.746 --> 00:41:34.980
will have a great deal of
charisma.

00:41:34.980 --> 00:41:37.960
And you can see it works.
 

00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:42.538
The Dalai Lama does have a lot
of charisma.

00:41:42.538 --> 00:41:43.409
Right?
 

00:41:43.409 --> 00:41:46.905
Well whether you believe in
reincarnation or not,

00:41:46.905 --> 00:41:48.579
that's another story.
 

00:41:48.579 --> 00:41:54.320
Probably most people in this
room do not believe in it,

00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:59.574
but if you do not believe in
it, even more miraculous why the

00:41:59.574 --> 00:42:04.039
Dalai Lama has this quite
extraordinary charisma.

00:42:04.039 --> 00:42:08.630
There are people who just get
wild if they can get near to the

00:42:08.630 --> 00:42:09.610
Dalai Lama.
 

00:42:09.610 --> 00:42:15.153
I had a student in Taiwan who
actually turned into a Buddhist

00:42:15.153 --> 00:42:19.590
and became a great follower of
the Dalai Lama.

00:42:19.590 --> 00:42:20.699
He got a Ph.D.
 

00:42:20.699 --> 00:42:26.780
from UCLA, but he's following;
wherever the Dalai Lama goes,

00:42:26.780 --> 00:42:28.019
he's always there.
 

00:42:28.019 --> 00:42:30.400
Because he has this charisma.
 

00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:33.869
His charisma is attributed to
him.

00:42:33.869 --> 00:42:34.710
Right?
 

00:42:34.710 --> 00:42:39.079
He was found in the right way,
and he was established as a

00:42:39.079 --> 00:42:40.690
charismatic leader.
 

00:42:40.690 --> 00:42:44.170
It can happen through
revelation.

00:42:44.170 --> 00:42:49.972
Revelation actually means that
there are some people who are

00:42:49.972 --> 00:42:55.875
believed to have some kind of
access to some divine authority

00:42:55.875 --> 00:43:00.989
who can declare that this is a
person who is the next

00:43:00.989 --> 00:43:03.449
charismatic leader.
 

00:43:03.449 --> 00:43:07.920
Well I don't think in
contemporary world revelation is

00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:09.268
all that much.
 

00:43:09.268 --> 00:43:11.811
Though, I mean,
newspapers do it for you.

00:43:11.811 --> 00:43:12.320
Right?
 

00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:16.969
The newspapers do create
charismatic leaders for you.

00:43:16.969 --> 00:43:22.244
They attach charisma,
they build up the charismatic

00:43:22.244 --> 00:43:26.739
powers of a person;
the media does it for you.

00:43:26.739 --> 00:43:31.253
And certainly the charisma
attributed to rock

00:43:31.253 --> 00:43:35.563
stars--right?--rock stars do
have charisma,

00:43:35.563 --> 00:43:39.769
right?--is created through the
media.

00:43:39.769 --> 00:43:41.920
The media has the oracle. Right?
 

00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:46.393
He knows who the great guys are
and whom you have to get

00:43:46.393 --> 00:43:50.380
absolutely excited when you get
to the concert.

00:43:50.380 --> 00:43:53.896
Well, there can be a
designation by the original

00:43:53.896 --> 00:43:54.570
leader.
 

00:43:54.570 --> 00:43:59.621
If the charismatic leader is
dying, then the charismatic

00:43:59.621 --> 00:44:03.570
leader has a problem to find a
successor.

00:44:03.570 --> 00:44:08.201
That's very difficult to do,
because charismatic leaders are

00:44:08.201 --> 00:44:12.438
bloody scared that if they
designate a leader then they

00:44:12.438 --> 00:44:15.030
will be poisoned or murdered.
 

00:44:15.030 --> 00:44:18.641
Or the new leader wants to take
it over--too often,

00:44:18.641 --> 00:44:23.045
very often, we see charismatic
leaders designating leaders and

00:44:23.045 --> 00:44:24.780
then murdering them.
 

00:44:24.780 --> 00:44:28.480
That's a long history in
humankind.

00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:32.869
But, you know,
an interesting example was that

00:44:32.869 --> 00:44:38.722
Stalin tried to build up his
charisma by faking a testimonial

00:44:38.722 --> 00:44:44.014
of Vladimir Ilyich Lenin,
in which assumedly Lenin said

00:44:44.014 --> 00:44:46.869
that Stalin will be the
successor.

00:44:46.869 --> 00:44:48.750
This was all a lie.
 

00:44:48.750 --> 00:44:53.579
Lenin actually disliked Stalin
a great deal and was very

00:44:53.579 --> 00:44:56.389
reluctant to name a successor.
 

00:44:56.389 --> 00:44:58.851
But he forged this letter and
tried to say,

00:44:58.851 --> 00:45:01.429
"Well I inherited the
charisma."

00:45:01.429 --> 00:45:04.724
And he had a lot of problems
actually to establish his

00:45:04.724 --> 00:45:05.409
charisma.
 

00:45:05.409 --> 00:45:09.157
Eventually, in fact during the
Second World War,

00:45:09.157 --> 00:45:12.664
he managed to emerge as a
charismatic leader,

00:45:12.664 --> 00:45:17.289
and not only in the Soviet
Union but even in the West.

00:45:17.289 --> 00:45:19.570
There's a lot of people in the
United States,

00:45:19.570 --> 00:45:23.699
as the Soviet Army defeated the
Germans,

00:45:23.699 --> 00:45:28.440
first in Moscow and then of
course in Stalingrad,

00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:31.699
that they began to see Stalin
as a great leader--

00:45:31.699 --> 00:45:34.280
right?--as a charismatic great
leader.

00:45:34.280 --> 00:45:37.592
But he probably had nothing to
do with the success of the Red

00:45:37.592 --> 00:45:37.980
Army.
 

00:45:37.980 --> 00:45:42.719
Well, or it can be designated
by a qualified staff.

00:45:42.719 --> 00:45:46.050
This is the way how,
for instance,

00:45:46.050 --> 00:45:50.601
the Pope is being selected;
and the pope does

00:45:50.601 --> 00:45:54.320
have--right?--a charismatic
authority.

00:45:54.320 --> 00:45:58.393
If you are Roman Catholic,
you know that the Pope has some

00:45:58.393 --> 00:46:01.110
access to God,
what you, ordinary Roman

00:46:01.110 --> 00:46:03.039
Catholics, do not have.
 

00:46:03.039 --> 00:46:06.900
And how is--but it's going on
from one Pope to the next.

00:46:06.900 --> 00:46:10.213
The character of the Pope will
matter.

00:46:10.213 --> 00:46:10.929
Right?
 

00:46:10.929 --> 00:46:14.009
There are some more,
you know, charming,

00:46:14.009 --> 00:46:17.324
more persuasive popes,
whom you see more of

00:46:17.324 --> 00:46:19.219
charismatic leaders.
 

00:46:19.219 --> 00:46:22.309
There are other popes who are
more like bureaucrats.

00:46:22.309 --> 00:46:26.007
But nevertheless,
even the bureaucratic kind of

00:46:26.007 --> 00:46:29.865
popes, are assumed to be
charismatic and they are

00:46:29.865 --> 00:46:32.679
selected by a designated staff.
 

00:46:32.679 --> 00:46:35.090
There is a certain set of
archbishops;

00:46:35.090 --> 00:46:38.800
when one pope dies,
they gather together in Rome,

00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:42.106
and they cannot leave,
you know, the room until they

00:46:42.106 --> 00:46:44.590
agree,
they achieve a consensus,

00:46:44.590 --> 00:46:48.318
who is the other person who
will have this special

00:46:48.318 --> 00:46:49.838
relationship to God.
 

00:46:49.838 --> 00:46:50.599
Right?
 

00:46:50.599 --> 00:46:55.635
There is also hereditary
charisma, that you try to pass

00:46:55.635 --> 00:47:00.579
charisma on through your
children--very hard to do.

00:47:00.579 --> 00:47:03.340
North Korea is trying to do
that.

00:47:03.340 --> 00:47:04.030
Right?
 

00:47:04.030 --> 00:47:09.552
Kim Il-sung passed his charisma
on to Kim Jong-il,

00:47:09.552 --> 00:47:14.059
which is an absolutely
ridiculous guy.

00:47:14.059 --> 00:47:17.317
But nevertheless,
you know, somehow it looks

00:47:17.317 --> 00:47:20.800
like, you know,
that in Korea he does have some

00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:23.150
kind of charismatic appeal.
 

00:47:23.150 --> 00:47:26.730
So, I mean, this is not totally
impossible.

00:47:26.730 --> 00:47:29.469
I mean, it's a bad idea,
you know, if you are a

00:47:29.469 --> 00:47:32.449
charismatic leader to pass
charisma on this way.

00:47:32.449 --> 00:47:35.639
Finally office charisma--this
is very important.

00:47:35.639 --> 00:47:39.780
Incumbents of an office is
supposed to have some charisma,

00:47:39.780 --> 00:47:41.670
depending on the office.
 

00:47:41.670 --> 00:47:45.659
But the office of the Pope,
of course, is supposed to have

00:47:45.659 --> 00:47:46.429
charisma.
 

00:47:46.429 --> 00:47:50.250
But we actually do use this
very often.

00:47:50.250 --> 00:47:55.228
We do--well in the United
States we call this leadership.

00:47:55.228 --> 00:47:55.940
Right?
 

00:47:55.940 --> 00:48:00.378
That we expect people in
position of certain authorities

00:48:00.378 --> 00:48:04.010
to offer leadership--to have
vision, right?

00:48:04.010 --> 00:48:08.284
And this is a kind of a
charisma which goes with the

00:48:08.284 --> 00:48:09.039
office.
 

00:48:09.039 --> 00:48:12.193
And, you know,
I have been department chair

00:48:12.193 --> 00:48:15.802
quite a few times,
and it's so interesting moving

00:48:15.802 --> 00:48:19.869
into the position of department
chair and moving out of it.

00:48:19.869 --> 00:48:24.280
Your relationship to your
colleagues changes a great deal.

00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:27.233
You know, when you are the
department chair,

00:48:27.233 --> 00:48:31.012
there is-- certainly some
charisma is attributed to you.

00:48:31.012 --> 00:48:31.699
Right?
 

00:48:31.699 --> 00:48:35.376
You are supposed to offer some
kind of leadership,

00:48:35.376 --> 00:48:39.730
and you are believed to be able
to bring in some change.

00:48:39.730 --> 00:48:42.054
I just remember,
you know, one of the

00:48:42.054 --> 00:48:45.480
institutions when I was an
incoming outside chair,

00:48:45.480 --> 00:48:49.021
how people said,
"Oh, you came in like

00:48:49.021 --> 00:48:50.539
fresh air."
 

00:48:50.539 --> 00:48:52.630
Well in two years' time it was
all gone.

00:48:52.630 --> 00:48:54.110
I was not fresh air.
 

00:48:54.110 --> 00:48:55.599
I was routine.
 

00:48:55.599 --> 00:48:58.965
You know, I was operating in a
bureaucracy, massaging the

00:48:58.965 --> 00:49:00.949
bureaucracy to get things done.
 

00:49:00.949 --> 00:49:02.989
My charisma was all gone.
 

00:49:02.989 --> 00:49:05.755
But there is,
right?--I think it's a very

00:49:05.755 --> 00:49:09.083
American thing,
right?--that you attach

00:49:09.083 --> 00:49:12.980
expectations to incumbents of
the office,

00:49:12.980 --> 00:49:15.710
that it can actually carry out
change,

00:49:15.710 --> 00:49:19.871
bring in fresh air--right?--to
have a vision and to do things

00:49:19.871 --> 00:49:22.159
better than it was done before.
 

00:49:22.159 --> 00:49:24.119
Okay, that's about charisma.
 

00:49:24.119 --> 00:49:25.429
Thank you.
 

00:49:25.429 --> 00:49:30.000

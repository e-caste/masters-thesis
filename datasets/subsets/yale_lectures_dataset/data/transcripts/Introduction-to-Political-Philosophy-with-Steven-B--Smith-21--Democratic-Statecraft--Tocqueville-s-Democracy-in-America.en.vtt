00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:05.772
Professor Steven Smith:
I want to begin by talking a

00:00:05.772 --> 00:00:09.757
little about what is the
question or what is the problem

00:00:09.757 --> 00:00:13.380
to which this immense book of
which you're reading,

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.133
I don't know,
a couple of hundred pages

00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:20.190
maximum--What is the problem
with which this huge book is

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:23.126
concerned?
It's always an important

00:00:23.126 --> 00:00:25.790
question to ask when you begin a
new book.

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:29.674
What question is the author
trying to ask or what problem is

00:00:29.674 --> 00:00:33.066
he trying to deal with?
Let me try to set up

00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:36.910
Tocqueville's problem in the
following way.

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.611
In the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries,

00:00:41.611 --> 00:00:46.749
the ideas of freedom and
equality seemed to walk

00:00:46.749 --> 00:00:51.095
confidently hand in hand.
Hobbes, Locke,

00:00:51.095 --> 00:00:55.546
Rousseau, who we've been
reading, all believed that in

00:00:55.546 --> 00:00:59.830
the state of nature,
remember, we were all born free

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:03.909
and equal.
As long as the enemy appeared

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:09.839
to be the entrenched hierarchies
of power and privilege of the

00:01:09.839 --> 00:01:13.503
old regime,
of the old monarchical

00:01:13.503 --> 00:01:19.366
societies, freedom and equality
were taken to be mutually

00:01:19.366 --> 00:01:25.230
reinforcing aspects of the
emerging democratic order.

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:30.217
But it was not until the
beginning of the nineteenth

00:01:30.217 --> 00:01:34.910
century, with the emergence of
the democracies or

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:39.800
proto-democracies of Europe and
the new world,

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.550
that political philosophers,
political thinkers began to

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:49.560
wonder whether freedom and
equality did not in fact pull in

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.744
different directions.
Tocqueville in particular,

00:01:53.744 --> 00:01:58.182
although you could add the
names like Benjamin Constant or

00:01:58.182 --> 00:02:02.459
John Stuart Mill,
but Tocqueville in particular

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:08.366
saw the new democratic societies
as creating new forms of social

00:02:08.366 --> 00:02:11.252
power,
new types of rule that

00:02:11.252 --> 00:02:16.078
represented, in some ways,
organized threats to human

00:02:16.078 --> 00:02:18.659
liberty.
What were these new forms of

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:21.471
social power?
These were, for Tocqueville,

00:02:21.471 --> 00:02:25.171
the new middle class or what we
might call bourgeois

00:02:25.171 --> 00:02:27.715
democracies,
the new middle class

00:02:27.715 --> 00:02:30.990
democracies emerging in
countries like France,

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:34.120
England and of course the
United States.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.544
And the problem for Tocqueville
or his question,

00:02:37.544 --> 00:02:41.989
as it was for Locke and others
before him, was how to mitigate

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:46.974
the effects of political power.
How does one control or

00:02:46.974 --> 00:02:50.730
mitigate for political power?
Yes?

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.310
Right?
You can see that.

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.573
Locke's answer,
you recall, to this problem was

00:02:56.573 --> 00:02:59.910
to divide and separate the
powers,

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.344
separated powers,
a theme clearly taken up and

00:03:03.344 --> 00:03:07.160
endorsed by the American
constitutional framers.

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:14.363
But Tocqueville was less
certain that this kind of

00:03:14.363 --> 00:03:17.430
institutional device,
so to speak,

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.130
of checks and balances or
separated powers,

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:26.504
could be an effective or truly
effective check in a democratic

00:03:26.504 --> 00:03:31.350
age where you might say the
people as a whole had become

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.759
king.
He was less certain that

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:36.220
institutional remedies alone
could work.

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.848
While 75 years before
Tocqueville wrote Democracy

00:03:40.848 --> 00:03:44.478
in America,
Rousseau had taken up the

00:03:44.478 --> 00:03:50.650
doctrine of popular sovereignty
to be an ideal to be worked for,

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.270
taking men as they are and laws
as they might be.

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:57.822
He looked to the doctrine of
popular sovereignty as something

00:03:57.822 --> 00:04:00.279
that could be.
But Tocqueville,

00:04:00.279 --> 00:04:05.089
again writing approximately 75
years after Rousseau,

00:04:05.089 --> 00:04:09.261
saw this doctrine,
this doctrine of popular

00:04:09.261 --> 00:04:13.187
sovereignty that,
for mid eighteenth-century

00:04:13.187 --> 00:04:18.209
Frenchmen had looked like a far
flung utopian ideal,

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:23.762
for Tocqueville this ideal had
become an altogether political

00:04:23.762 --> 00:04:29.129
reality that had taken shape in
the backwoods of Jacksonian

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:31.868
America.
Consider just the following

00:04:31.868 --> 00:04:33.980
passage from the
Democracy.

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.533
"In the United States,"
Tocqueville writes,

00:04:36.533 --> 00:04:39.329
"the dogma," he says,
he calls it the dogma,

00:04:39.329 --> 00:04:42.760
"of the sovereignty of the
people is not an isolated

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:46.661
doctrine that is joined neither
to habits nor to the sum of

00:04:46.661 --> 00:04:49.946
dominant ideas.
On the contrary," he says,

00:04:49.946 --> 00:04:54.577
"one can view it as the last
link in a chain of opinions that

00:04:54.577 --> 00:04:58.360
envelops the Anglo American
world as a whole."

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:03.365
And he goes on to say that
extended to the entirety of the

00:05:03.365 --> 00:05:06.439
nation it becomes,
it, this opinion,

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:11.269
becomes the dogma of the
sovereignty of the people.

00:05:11.269 --> 00:05:16.258
So here you have Tocqueville's
view that this Rousseauian

00:05:16.258 --> 00:05:21.959
concept of popular sovereignty
has become an existent reality.

00:05:21.959 --> 00:05:25.764
And for Tocqueville,
there was no reason to believe

00:05:25.764 --> 00:05:28.959
that the new democratic states
emerging,

00:05:28.959 --> 00:05:33.059
again, in America and in
Europe, these new democratic

00:05:33.059 --> 00:05:37.002
states, ruled by the
people--there was no reason to

00:05:37.002 --> 00:05:41.811
believe that they will be more
just or less arbitrary than any

00:05:41.811 --> 00:05:46.781
other previous kind of regime.
For Tocqueville no one,

00:05:46.781 --> 00:05:52.064
no person or body of persons,
can be safely entrusted with

00:05:52.064 --> 00:05:57.069
political power and the united
power of the people,

00:05:57.069 --> 00:06:01.984
the united sovereignty of the
people, is no more for him a

00:06:01.984 --> 00:06:07.329
reliable guarantor of freedom
than any other kind of regime.

00:06:07.329 --> 00:06:11.155
So the problem of politics,
you might say,

00:06:11.155 --> 00:06:15.261
in age of democracy,
is the problem of how to

00:06:15.261 --> 00:06:19.180
control the sovereignty of the
people.

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:20.777
For Rousseau,
you remember,

00:06:20.777 --> 00:06:23.480
that was never really seriously
a problem.

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:26.839
The general will,
he says, cannot err,

00:06:26.839 --> 00:06:32.378
the people when they are ruling
in their collective capacities

00:06:32.378 --> 00:06:38.190
cannot be wrong but Tocqueville
was less certain about this,

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:43.720
whether or not the people,
in their collective capacity as

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:47.310
sovereign, are an infallible
guide.

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:51.490
The question is,
what can be done about that?

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:54.052
In aristocratic ages,
you might say,

00:06:54.052 --> 00:06:57.832
the answer was simple.
Tocqueville believed that in

00:06:57.832 --> 00:07:02.239
aristocratic times there were
always countervailing centers of

00:07:02.239 --> 00:07:06.411
power.
Kings, no matter how powerful,

00:07:06.411 --> 00:07:13.218
always had to contend with
fractious and warlike nobilities

00:07:13.218 --> 00:07:16.297
but,
again, who or what can exercise

00:07:16.297 --> 00:07:20.740
that countervailing power in a
world where the people in their

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:25.740
collective capacity have,
to repeat, become the king?

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:30.664
Who or what has the power to
check the popular will or the

00:07:30.664 --> 00:07:33.638
general will?
This is the problem,

00:07:33.638 --> 00:07:37.666
how to check democratic power.
This is the problem that

00:07:37.666 --> 00:07:41.055
Tocqueville's new political
science, what he boasts in the

00:07:41.055 --> 00:07:45.248
introduction to the book,
is a new political science for

00:07:45.248 --> 00:07:49.795
a world itself quite new.
This is the problem that he

00:07:49.795 --> 00:07:53.906
sets out to answer.
And to this extent I would also

00:07:53.906 --> 00:07:56.959
say we, are all Tocqueville's
children.

00:07:56.959 --> 00:08:00.711
We are all disciples of
Tocqueville insofar as our

00:08:00.711 --> 00:08:05.151
political science continues to
deal with the problem of the

00:08:05.151 --> 00:08:08.980
guidance and control of
democratic government,

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:13.691
how to, you might say,
combine popular government with

00:08:13.691 --> 00:08:17.267
political wisdom.
How to do that remains a

00:08:17.267 --> 00:08:21.513
problem, you might say,
akin to squaring the circle but

00:08:21.513 --> 00:08:25.759
it remains the fundamental
problem for democracies,

00:08:25.759 --> 00:08:30.259
how to combine popular rule
with political wisdom.

00:08:30.259 --> 00:08:33.290
That was really what
Tocqueville was concerned about.

00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:43.648
But before going on,
let me ask, who was Alexis de

00:08:43.648 --> 00:08:49.130
Tocqueville?
Let me tell you something about

00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:52.592
him.
Tocqueville was born in 1805

00:08:52.592 --> 00:08:57.256
into a Norman family from the
north of France,

00:08:57.256 --> 00:09:01.610
from Normandy,
with an ancient lineage.

00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:07.664
The Tocqueville estate still
stands today and is owned still

00:09:07.664 --> 00:09:13.000
in the hands of members of the
Tocqueville family.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.923
I know because I visited it a
couple of summers ago and met

00:09:17.923 --> 00:09:22.676
his heirs although they are not
actually the heirs of him

00:09:22.676 --> 00:09:25.927
directly.
Tocqueville and his wife had no

00:09:25.927 --> 00:09:28.896
children.
They belonged to one of the

00:09:28.896 --> 00:09:34.039
brothers' side of the family but
absolutely charming people,

00:09:34.039 --> 00:09:39.949
exactly what you'd think French
aristocrats would be like,

00:09:39.949 --> 00:09:46.679
all charm and grace,
wonderful hosts.

00:09:46.679 --> 00:09:51.429
And Tocqueville was deeply
attached to his ancestral home.

00:09:51.429 --> 00:09:55.237
In a letter from 1828,
one of my favorite Tocqueville

00:09:55.237 --> 00:09:59.388
letters, he wrote to a friend,
"Here I am," after returning

00:09:59.388 --> 00:10:01.390
from a trip abroad,
a trip away,

00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:03.909
"Here I am, finally at
Tocqueville,"

00:10:03.909 --> 00:10:07.049
referring to the home simply by
the family name.

00:10:07.049 --> 00:10:10.019
"I am finally at Tocqueville in
my family's old,

00:10:10.019 --> 00:10:13.387
broken down ruin.
At a league's distance I can

00:10:13.387 --> 00:10:18.419
see the harbor where William the
Conqueror set sail for England.

00:10:18.419 --> 00:10:23.513
I am surrounded by Normans
whose names figure among the

00:10:23.513 --> 00:10:26.890
conquerors.
All of this I have to confess

00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:28.300
tickles my heart."

00:10:31.419 --> 00:10:36.153
So he comes from a line of
people who trace their ancestry

00:10:36.153 --> 00:10:41.385
back to the Norman conquest and
have been in that part of France

00:10:41.385 --> 00:10:45.138
for centuries.
In fact, the Tocqueville home

00:10:45.138 --> 00:10:49.810
is a short drive away from the
Normandy beach where the big D

00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:53.470
Day invasion took place during
World War II.

00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:56.960
It's a miracle that the home
still survives.

00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:01.606
Tocqueville's parents had been
arrested during the French

00:11:01.606 --> 00:11:06.170
Revolution and were held in
prison for almost a year and

00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:11.730
only the fall of Robespierre in
1794 saved them from execution.

00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:16.910
The young Tocqueville was born
under the Napoleonic dynasty and

00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:21.885
spent his formative years,
his adolescence and his school

00:11:21.885 --> 00:11:24.872
years, under the most
conservative,

00:11:24.872 --> 00:11:31.237
if not to say reactionary,
circles of post revolutionary

00:11:31.237 --> 00:11:34.298
France.
Tocqueville studied law in

00:11:34.298 --> 00:11:38.470
Paris and during this time he
made the acquaintance and

00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:42.488
friendship of another young
aristocrat by the name of

00:11:42.488 --> 00:11:45.456
Gustave de Beaumont.
And in 1830,

00:11:45.456 --> 00:11:48.997
for reasons that are not
altogether clear,

00:11:48.997 --> 00:11:53.524
when he was 25 or so,
in 1830, the two men received a

00:11:53.524 --> 00:11:57.799
commission from the new
government of Louis Philippe,

00:11:57.799 --> 00:12:01.054
King Louis Philippe,
to go to the United States to

00:12:01.054 --> 00:12:04.899
study the prison system there.
The trip to the U.S.

00:12:04.899 --> 00:12:09.366
was occasioned by a grant you,
might say, a fellowship,

00:12:09.366 --> 00:12:12.510
to study the American prison
system.

00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:20.693
Tocqueville's journey to
America, which has been

00:12:20.693 --> 00:12:25.405
extensively documented,
lasted for just under a year

00:12:25.405 --> 00:12:30.452
from May 1831 to February 1832,
and during that time he

00:12:30.452 --> 00:12:35.179
traveled as far north as New
England, south to New Orleans.

00:12:35.179 --> 00:12:39.729
Yes, he was in New Orleans and
went to the outer banks of Lake

00:12:39.729 --> 00:12:43.013
Michigan.
The result of this visit was of

00:12:43.013 --> 00:12:47.623
course the two large volumes
that he called Democracy in

00:12:47.623 --> 00:12:51.279
America, Democratie en
Amerique.

00:12:51.279 --> 00:12:55.949
The first volume appeared five
years, four years or so after

00:12:55.949 --> 00:13:00.539
his trip, in 1835 when its
author was only 30 years old.

00:13:00.539 --> 00:13:05.405
The second volume appeared five
years later in 1840 and both of

00:13:05.405 --> 00:13:09.799
those volumes are contained
within the single volume that

00:13:09.799 --> 00:13:12.826
you have.
Tocqueville's trip has been

00:13:12.826 --> 00:13:18.420
much studied and much admired.
Even just in very recent times,

00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:23.620
a French philosopher,
by the name of Bernard Henri

00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:26.760
Levy,
came over, didn't exactly

00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:32.440
follow Tocqueville's journey but
traveled throughout America,

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:37.711
a kind of Frenchman's guide,
a sort of Borat's America

00:13:37.711 --> 00:13:43.778
almost, going to Las Vegas and
evangelical churches and all of

00:13:43.778 --> 00:13:46.463
this stuff,
and wrote a very interesting

00:13:46.463 --> 00:13:48.040
book called American
Vertigo.

00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:56.081
The most charitable thing I can
remark is that he was no

00:13:56.081 --> 00:13:58.838
Tocqueville but,
leaving that aside,

00:13:58.838 --> 00:14:01.280
it was an admirable effort.

00:14:04.950 --> 00:14:07.571
Democracy in America,
to put it simply,

00:14:07.571 --> 00:14:10.774
is the most important work
about democracy that you will

00:14:10.774 --> 00:14:11.590
ever read.

00:14:15.059 --> 00:14:18.795
To compound the irony,
the most famous book on

00:14:18.795 --> 00:14:23.942
American democracy was written
by a French aristocrat who might

00:14:23.942 --> 00:14:29.742
have been deeply foreign,
if not hostile to the manners,

00:14:29.742 --> 00:14:34.379
customs, habits of a democratic
society.

00:14:34.379 --> 00:14:38.183
And from the time of its first
publication in 1835,

00:14:38.183 --> 00:14:41.149
the book was hailed as a
masterpiece.

00:14:41.149 --> 00:14:44.721
John Stuart Mill called the
book a masterpiece that has at

00:14:44.721 --> 00:14:47.416
once, he says,
taken its rank among the most

00:14:47.416 --> 00:14:49.860
remarkable productions of our
time.

00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:54.655
Tocqueville has come to take
his side, his place alongside of

00:14:54.655 --> 00:14:59.131
Washington, Jefferson and
Madison almost as if he were an

00:14:59.131 --> 00:15:02.860
honorary American.
And, as if this were not

00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:07.868
enough, a recent translation of
the book was recently inducted

00:15:07.868 --> 00:15:12.794
into the prestigious Library of
America series which seems to

00:15:12.794 --> 00:15:17.884
put the stamp of naturalization
on a book written in French for

00:15:17.884 --> 00:15:22.564
Frenchmen and yet it is part of
the prestigious Library of

00:15:22.564 --> 00:15:27.421
America.
As Tocqueville might have said,

00:15:27.421 --> 00:15:30.477
go figure.
I don't know how to say that in

00:15:30.477 --> 00:15:34.124
French actually.
But there is a textbook image

00:15:34.124 --> 00:15:39.231
of Tocqueville according to
which he came to America as a

00:15:39.231 --> 00:15:44.612
kind of blank slate and the
experience of American democracy

00:15:44.612 --> 00:15:49.628
had a profoundly transformative
influence over the young

00:15:49.628 --> 00:15:53.455
aristocrat.
But nothing I would suggest to

00:15:53.455 --> 00:15:56.149
you could be further from the
truth.

00:15:56.149 --> 00:16:00.109
In a letter to his best friend,
a man named Louis de Kergolay,

00:16:00.109 --> 00:16:03.808
whose home, whose estate is
actually directly next door to

00:16:03.808 --> 00:16:07.508
the Tocqueville estate--In a
letter to Tocqueville written

00:16:07.508 --> 00:16:10.948
just before the publication of
the first volume of the

00:16:10.948 --> 00:16:14.771
Democracy in 1835,
Tocqueville describes his

00:16:14.771 --> 00:16:17.730
purpose in writing his book in
these terms.

00:16:17.730 --> 00:16:20.478
Let me read from his letter.
Tocqueville writes,

00:16:20.478 --> 00:16:23.237
"It is not without having
carefully reflected that I

00:16:23.237 --> 00:16:26.159
decided to write the book I am
just now publishing.

00:16:26.159 --> 00:16:31.679
I do not hide from myself what
is annoying in my position.

00:16:31.679 --> 00:16:36.080
It is bound to attract active
sympathy from no one.

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:41.084
Some will find that at bottom I
do not like democracy and am

00:16:41.084 --> 00:16:46.258
severe toward it but others will
think I favor its development

00:16:46.258 --> 00:16:49.717
immoderately.
It would be most fortunate for

00:16:49.717 --> 00:16:53.954
me if the book were not read and
that is a piece of good fortune

00:16:53.954 --> 00:16:56.509
that may perhaps soon come to
pass.

00:16:56.509 --> 00:17:00.690
I know all that but here is my
response.

00:17:00.690 --> 00:17:03.862
Nearly 10 years ago,
I was already thinking about

00:17:03.862 --> 00:17:07.299
part of the things that I have
just now set forth.

00:17:07.299 --> 00:17:11.259
I was in America only to become
clear on this point.

00:17:11.259 --> 00:17:13.290
The penitentiary system was a
pretext."

00:17:16.309 --> 00:17:20.724
So two points,
I think, bear comment about

00:17:20.724 --> 00:17:27.829
this remarkable statement of his
purpose to his friend Kergolay.

00:17:27.829 --> 00:17:32.182
First is that Tocqueville
indicates that his idea for the

00:17:32.182 --> 00:17:35.835
book had already,
as he says, begun to germinate

00:17:35.835 --> 00:17:39.099
five years before his trip to
America.

00:17:39.099 --> 00:17:42.592
He says the penitentiary
system, the penitentiary project

00:17:42.592 --> 00:17:45.461
for which he was sent over,
was only a pretext,

00:17:45.461 --> 00:17:48.293
he said.
He already had begun to

00:17:48.293 --> 00:17:53.185
speculate on these things,
he says, 10 years before his

00:17:53.185 --> 00:17:55.869
trip.
Now, if you do the math,

00:17:55.869 --> 00:18:00.603
when you consider that he was
30 years old in 1835 when the

00:18:00.603 --> 00:18:04.767
book's first volume was
published and he said he was

00:18:04.767 --> 00:18:09.420
speculating on these things
already 10 years before,

00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:12.859
it would seem that the germ of
the idea for the book,

00:18:12.859 --> 00:18:15.769
the germ idea,
the germ cell for the book,

00:18:15.769 --> 00:18:20.960
had occurred to Tocqueville
when he was only 20 years old,

00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:26.150
that is to say about the age
that most of you are here.

00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:31.398
And he went to America only to
confirm what he had begun to

00:18:31.398 --> 00:18:37.280
suspect when he was at the age
of a contemporary undergraduate.

00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:41.340
Think of that.
Get your idea now.

00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:45.532
Get it quickly.
Then maybe you can write a

00:18:45.532 --> 00:18:48.609
famous book by the time you are
30.

00:18:48.609 --> 00:18:53.140
I have to tell you it is way,
way beyond that stage for me.

00:18:57.099 --> 00:19:01.667
Hobbes, however,
did not write his masterpiece

00:19:01.667 --> 00:19:07.250
until he was 63 so there's still
hope for some of us.

00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:10.697
Nevertheless,
the second point I would make

00:19:10.697 --> 00:19:15.787
about that letter is that it is
also clear that Tocqueville was

00:19:15.787 --> 00:19:20.220
writing his book not for the
benefit of Americans,

00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:24.144
who you will discover he
thought had little taste for

00:19:24.144 --> 00:19:27.492
philosophy, but for Frenchmen.
In particular,

00:19:27.492 --> 00:19:30.625
he was hoping to persuade his
fellow countrymen,

00:19:30.625 --> 00:19:34.690
who were still devoted to the
restoration of the monarchy,

00:19:34.690 --> 00:19:39.526
that the democratic social
revolution that he had witnessed

00:19:39.526 --> 00:19:43.779
in America represented also the
future of France.

00:19:43.779 --> 00:19:47.052
If John Locke had said in his
Second Treatise,

00:19:47.052 --> 00:19:50.451
when Locke had said "in the
beginning all the world was

00:19:50.451 --> 00:19:54.310
America,"
Tocqueville's point appears to

00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:59.480
be in the future all of the
world will be America.

00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:04.025
His attitude towards what he
saw or what we would perhaps

00:20:04.025 --> 00:20:09.075
call today Americanization,
democratization--his attitude

00:20:09.075 --> 00:20:13.910
towards this was one of
skepticism mixed with fear.

00:20:13.910 --> 00:20:16.756
"I confess," he writes,
"that in America I saw more

00:20:16.756 --> 00:20:19.575
than America.
I sought there an image of

00:20:19.575 --> 00:20:23.280
democracy itself or its
penchants, its characters,

00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:25.700
its prejudices,
its passions.

00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:31.758
I wanted to become acquainted
with it if only to know at least

00:20:31.758 --> 00:20:35.829
what we ought to hope or fear
from it."

00:20:35.829 --> 00:20:41.041
And that sentence is so typical
of Tocqueville,

00:20:41.041 --> 00:20:46.140
the way he piles on the
descriptive labels,

00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:48.265
"its penchants,
its character,

00:20:48.265 --> 00:20:50.609
its prejudices,
its passions."

00:20:50.609 --> 00:20:53.616
So there are embedded in that
two questions,

00:20:53.616 --> 00:20:57.602
two you might say subordinate
clauses or two sub questions

00:20:57.602 --> 00:21:00.329
that Tocqueville set out to
answer.

00:21:00.329 --> 00:21:04.864
The first concerns the gradual
replacement of the ancien

00:21:04.864 --> 00:21:09.336
régime, that is to say,
the French term for the old,

00:21:09.336 --> 00:21:13.210
aristocratic order based on
privileges, hierarchy,

00:21:13.210 --> 00:21:17.705
deference and inequality,
with a new democratic society

00:21:17.705 --> 00:21:22.261
based on equality.
How did this happen and what

00:21:22.261 --> 00:21:26.392
brought it about,
this immense social and

00:21:26.392 --> 00:21:31.349
political transformation from
the old regime,

00:21:31.349 --> 00:21:36.181
from an age of inequality to an
increasing age of equality,

00:21:36.181 --> 00:21:41.013
a huge example of what we might
call today regime change or

00:21:41.013 --> 00:21:46.034
regime transformation?
And the second--How did that

00:21:46.034 --> 00:21:48.588
happen?
And the second not perhaps

00:21:48.588 --> 00:21:52.333
explicitly asked question,
but nevertheless a question on

00:21:52.333 --> 00:21:55.410
virtually every page of
Tocqueville's book,

00:21:55.410 --> 00:22:00.306
concerns the difference between
the form democracy has taken in

00:22:00.306 --> 00:22:04.255
America and the form it took in
France during their

00:22:04.255 --> 00:22:07.947
revolutionary period.
Why, Tocqueville asks,

00:22:07.947 --> 00:22:12.240
has American democracy been
relatively gentle or mild?

00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:16.170
Those are two characteristic
Tocquevillian terms.

00:22:16.170 --> 00:22:20.589
Why has American democracy been
what we might call today a

00:22:20.589 --> 00:22:24.699
liberal democracy and why did
democracy in France veer

00:22:24.699 --> 00:22:29.041
dangerously close towards terror
and despotism during its

00:22:29.041 --> 00:22:32.414
revolution?
That was the second question

00:22:32.414 --> 00:22:36.680
Tocqueville set out to answer.
Tocqueville believed it to be

00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:40.729
virtually a providential fact of
history that societies were

00:22:40.729 --> 00:22:43.200
becoming increasingly
democratic,

00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:46.099
increasingly egalitarian,
we might say.

00:22:46.099 --> 00:22:48.819
What is not certain,
you could say,

00:22:48.819 --> 00:22:51.619
is what form democracy will
take.

00:22:51.619 --> 00:22:55.555
Whether democracy will be
compatible with liberty or

00:22:55.555 --> 00:23:00.109
whether it will issue into a new
kind of despotism remains a

00:23:00.109 --> 00:23:04.816
question that only the statesmen
of the future will be able to

00:23:04.816 --> 00:23:08.000
answer.
And from these two questions,

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:12.059
"how did this transformation
occur" and "what form will

00:23:12.059 --> 00:23:15.956
democracy take in the future,"
from these two questions,

00:23:15.956 --> 00:23:19.130
we can see that Tocqueville
wrote his book as a political

00:23:19.130 --> 00:23:21.905
educator,
that Tocqueville takes his

00:23:21.905 --> 00:23:25.531
place along with people like
Plato, Aristotle,

00:23:25.531 --> 00:23:28.956
Machiavelli,
and the others as a great

00:23:28.956 --> 00:23:32.804
political educator.
He was more than a mere

00:23:32.804 --> 00:23:38.126
chronicler of American manners
and customs but rather was an

00:23:38.126 --> 00:23:43.357
educator of future European
statesmen hoping to steer their

00:23:43.357 --> 00:23:48.859
countries between the shoals of
revolution and reaction.

00:23:48.859 --> 00:23:54.319
How did Tocqueville attempt to
accomplish this?

00:23:54.319 --> 00:24:01.068
Let me try to talk for a moment
about what he hoped to teach

00:24:01.068 --> 00:24:07.931
because you have to admire the
book and have to understand it

00:24:07.931 --> 00:24:13.447
as an immense handbook,
almost as it were of the

00:24:13.447 --> 00:24:19.111
education of a democratic
statesman, slightly larger than

00:24:19.111 --> 00:24:24.471
Machiavelli's Prince
perhaps but nevertheless a

00:24:24.471 --> 00:24:28.720
handbook for state craft
nonetheless.

00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:29.880
What did he hope to teach?

00:24:35.279 --> 00:24:37.450
Near the end of the
introduction,

00:24:37.450 --> 00:24:41.654
and I pay special attention to
that fascinating introduction to

00:24:41.654 --> 00:24:45.519
the book--I don't mean the
translator's introduction.

00:24:45.519 --> 00:24:47.710
I mean Tocqueville's own
introduction.

00:24:47.710 --> 00:24:50.499
Near the end of the
introduction,

00:24:50.499 --> 00:24:53.549
he writes the following
sentence.

00:24:53.549 --> 00:24:57.127
"I think those who want to
regard it, namely his book,

00:24:57.127 --> 00:25:01.109
who want to regard it closely
will find in the entire work a

00:25:01.109 --> 00:25:04.104
mother thought that,
so to speak,

00:25:04.104 --> 00:25:08.569
links all the parts,
a mother thought.

00:25:08.569 --> 00:25:14.420
His word, term is an idée
mere, a mother idea.

00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:19.213
What is this mother idea or
mother thought to which he

00:25:19.213 --> 00:25:23.326
refers there?
And the most likely candidate

00:25:23.326 --> 00:25:27.700
for its central idea is the idea
of equality.

00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:31.718
The opening sentence of the
book reads: "Among the new

00:25:31.718 --> 00:25:35.965
objects that attracted my
attention during my stay in the

00:25:35.965 --> 00:25:40.003
United States,
none struck my eye more vividly

00:25:40.003 --> 00:25:44.900
than the equality of conditions.
The equality of conditions.

00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:49.779
What does he mean by that
phrase?

00:25:49.779 --> 00:25:52.569
What is meant by "equality"
here?

00:25:52.569 --> 00:25:56.654
Note, in the first instance,
that Tocqueville speaks of

00:25:56.654 --> 00:26:01.497
equality as a social condition,
an equality of conditions,

00:26:01.497 --> 00:26:05.109
not a form of government per
se.

00:26:05.109 --> 00:26:09.972
This is in part an expression
of what you might think of as

00:26:09.972 --> 00:26:13.410
Tocqueville's sociological
imagination.

00:26:13.410 --> 00:26:18.849
Equality of conditions precedes
democratic government.

00:26:18.849 --> 00:26:21.862
Equality of conditions,
you might say,

00:26:21.862 --> 00:26:26.339
is the cause from which
democratic governments arise.

00:26:26.339 --> 00:26:31.352
Equality of conditions were
planted both in Europe and in

00:26:31.352 --> 00:26:36.454
America long before democratic
governments arose in either

00:26:36.454 --> 00:26:39.990
place.
Democratic governments are only

00:26:39.990 --> 00:26:45.186
as old--at least in France and
America, democratic governments

00:26:45.186 --> 00:26:49.956
are only as old as the American
or French revolutions but

00:26:49.956 --> 00:26:54.556
equality of conditions had been
prepared by deep rooted

00:26:54.556 --> 00:26:59.496
historical processes that began
long before the dawn of the

00:26:59.496 --> 00:27:03.696
modern age.
So equality of conditions

00:27:03.696 --> 00:27:08.589
refers to a social fact,
not a form of government,

00:27:08.589 --> 00:27:14.281
and which precede democratic
government by long periods of

00:27:14.281 --> 00:27:17.095
time.
And in the introduction to his

00:27:17.095 --> 00:27:20.970
book, again, Tocqueville gives a
brief, I would say very brief,

00:27:20.970 --> 00:27:26.305
history of equality,
taking it as far back to the

00:27:26.305 --> 00:27:32.259
heart of the medieval world,
some 700 years he says.

00:27:32.259 --> 00:27:35.861
Unlike Hobbes or Rousseau,
he does not invoke a state of

00:27:35.861 --> 00:27:38.480
nature as a way of grounding
equality.

00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:42.504
In fact, for Tocqueville what
Hobbes and Rousseau believed

00:27:42.504 --> 00:27:46.670
that we are by nature free and
equal and only over time they

00:27:46.670 --> 00:27:51.259
believed were social hierarchies
and inequalities introduced,

00:27:51.259 --> 00:27:55.519
Tocqueville argues exactly the
opposite point of view.

00:27:55.519 --> 00:27:58.314
The historical process,
so to speak,

00:27:58.314 --> 00:28:02.706
has been moving away from
inequality and towards greater

00:28:02.706 --> 00:28:06.380
and greater equality of social
conditions.

00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:10.628
The historical process,
at least as Tocqueville traces

00:28:10.628 --> 00:28:15.196
it out here, has been a process
of gradual equalization of

00:28:15.196 --> 00:28:19.198
social conditions.
His equality is something like

00:28:19.198 --> 00:28:23.004
an historical force,
something that has been working

00:28:23.004 --> 00:28:26.960
itself out in history over a
vast stretch of time,

00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:30.955
and he often writes as if
equality is not just one fact

00:28:30.955 --> 00:28:35.024
among others but is what he
calls a generative fact from

00:28:35.024 --> 00:28:40.089
which everything else derives.
"As I studied America more and

00:28:40.089 --> 00:28:43.660
more," he writes,
"I saw in the equality of

00:28:43.660 --> 00:28:48.845
conditions the generative fact
from which each particular fact

00:28:48.845 --> 00:28:52.774
seems to issue,"
he says in the second paragraph

00:28:52.774 --> 00:28:56.303
of his introduction,
"the generative fact from which

00:28:56.303 --> 00:28:59.140
each particular fact seemed to
issue."

00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:04.534
Tocqueville writes here about
equality as an historical fact

00:29:04.534 --> 00:29:09.747
that has come to acquire an
almost providential force over

00:29:09.747 --> 00:29:11.981
time.
And he uses this term

00:29:11.981 --> 00:29:16.079
"providence" here several times
throughout the introduction.

00:29:16.079 --> 00:29:19.656
He uses that term not so much
to describe God,

00:29:19.656 --> 00:29:23.472
as one might think,
but rather to describe a sort

00:29:23.472 --> 00:29:28.480
of universal historical process
that is working itself out,

00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:32.411
so to speak,
even against the intentions of

00:29:32.411 --> 00:29:36.250
individual social and political
actors.

00:29:36.250 --> 00:29:41.126
The gradual spread of the
conditions of equality,

00:29:41.126 --> 00:29:44.885
he believes,
has two characters or two

00:29:44.885 --> 00:29:49.722
characteristics of providence.
It is universal,

00:29:49.722 --> 00:29:54.909
he says, and it always escapes
the power of the individual to

00:29:54.909 --> 00:29:58.148
control.
If Machiavelli believed we can

00:29:58.148 --> 00:30:02.039
control fortuna,
we can control providence or

00:30:02.039 --> 00:30:06.506
chance half the time,
Tocqueville seems to believe

00:30:06.506 --> 00:30:11.779
that the process of equality
always escapes the powers of

00:30:11.779 --> 00:30:15.217
human control.
It is the very power of

00:30:15.217 --> 00:30:19.769
equality that makes it seem to
be an irresistible force.

00:30:19.769 --> 00:30:23.860
Rather than the product of the
modern age alone,

00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:29.081
again, Tocqueville shows how
the steady emergence of equality

00:30:29.081 --> 00:30:33.693
of conditions has been the
central dynamic of European

00:30:33.693 --> 00:30:37.609
history over several hundreds of
years.

00:30:37.609 --> 00:30:41.584
He frames the book within you
might say a very large-scale

00:30:41.584 --> 00:30:45.140
sort of philosophy of history in
which democracy,

00:30:45.140 --> 00:30:48.941
equality, and the gradual
equalization of social

00:30:48.941 --> 00:30:52.500
conditions are the sort of
central motifs.

00:30:58.359 --> 00:31:03.544
So it is in order to understand
that process that Tocqueville

00:31:03.544 --> 00:31:08.404
turns to America of the 1830s.
"There is only one country in

00:31:08.404 --> 00:31:11.509
the world," he says,
"where the great social

00:31:11.509 --> 00:31:15.554
revolution I am speaking of
seems nearly to have attained

00:31:15.554 --> 00:31:19.699
its natural limits,"
one country where this social

00:31:19.699 --> 00:31:24.057
revolution, the democratic
transformations from the old

00:31:24.057 --> 00:31:27.930
aristocratic order to the new
democratic age,

00:31:27.930 --> 00:31:30.587
seems to have reached its
natural limits,

00:31:30.587 --> 00:31:33.910
and that country is of course
the United States.

00:31:37.630 --> 00:31:41.596
In this context,
I think, it is very revealing

00:31:41.596 --> 00:31:46.973
that he chose to call his book
Democracy in America and

00:31:46.973 --> 00:31:52.835
not simply American democracy.
Think about that choice of

00:31:52.835 --> 00:31:57.115
title for a moment.
His point, I take it,

00:31:57.115 --> 00:32:02.551
is that it's not that democracy
is a peculiarly American

00:32:02.551 --> 00:32:06.271
phenomenon, far from it.
His point is,

00:32:06.271 --> 00:32:10.961
when he's describing democracy
in America, here is the form

00:32:10.961 --> 00:32:15.410
that the democratic revolution
has taken in America.

00:32:15.410 --> 00:32:19.068
What form it will take
elsewhere or it may take

00:32:19.068 --> 00:32:22.329
elsewhere is by no means
predetermined.

00:32:22.329 --> 00:32:26.480
Democracy is not a settled or
fixed condition.

00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:31.271
It is something more like a
process and when we think of the

00:32:31.271 --> 00:32:35.819
way we speak today when we talk
about democratization,

00:32:35.819 --> 00:32:40.676
the process of democratization,
you can see that democracy

00:32:40.676 --> 00:32:45.533
seems to be less a settled or
fixed or determinate kind of

00:32:45.533 --> 00:32:50.017
regime than a kind of process.
It has the quality that

00:32:50.017 --> 00:32:53.675
Rousseau referred to in the
Second Discourse as

00:32:53.675 --> 00:32:56.627
perfectibilité,
perfectibility,

00:32:56.627 --> 00:33:00.947
that is to say an almost
infinite elasticity and openness

00:33:00.947 --> 00:33:04.821
to change.
Again, it is less a determinate

00:33:04.821 --> 00:33:10.564
political or social order than a
continual work in progress and

00:33:10.564 --> 00:33:15.009
that is the way Tocqueville
looks at America,

00:33:15.009 --> 00:33:17.526
in some ways,
or looks at the future of

00:33:17.526 --> 00:33:20.970
democracy when he says,
"I look at the place where it

00:33:20.970 --> 00:33:24.746
seems to have attained its
natural limit" but what form it

00:33:24.746 --> 00:33:28.454
may take elsewhere is by no
means to say that the form it

00:33:28.454 --> 00:33:32.759
takes in America is the form it
will take anywhere else."

00:33:32.759 --> 00:33:37.317
Democracy is the regime that
seems to be almost infinitely

00:33:37.317 --> 00:33:41.554
elastic in terms of its
possibilities and this I think

00:33:41.554 --> 00:33:45.951
is a profound and astute
observation about the nature of

00:33:45.951 --> 00:33:50.067
democratic government.
We do not know where the

00:33:50.067 --> 00:33:54.838
process of democratization will
end any more today than we did

00:33:54.838 --> 00:33:58.750
in Tocqueville's time or that
Tocqueville knew.

00:33:58.750 --> 00:34:03.292
It is a matter for statecraft
and leadership and political

00:34:03.292 --> 00:34:06.211
thought.
Again, will future democracies

00:34:06.211 --> 00:34:10.029
be liberal and freedom loving or
will they be harsh and

00:34:10.029 --> 00:34:13.444
rebarbative?
That is a question that we are

00:34:13.444 --> 00:34:17.839
now seeing very upfront and
close in various parts of the

00:34:17.839 --> 00:34:22.312
world today that are undergoing
their own very tempestuous

00:34:22.312 --> 00:34:26.864
transitions to democracy as we
will say and it remains very

00:34:26.864 --> 00:34:31.463
much an open question,
what form those democracies

00:34:31.463 --> 00:34:34.834
will take.
That question is at least as

00:34:34.834 --> 00:34:37.605
important for us,
if not more so,

00:34:37.605 --> 00:34:42.465
than it was for Tocqueville.
What Tocqueville is sure about,

00:34:42.465 --> 00:34:46.606
however, is that the fate of
America is in some way the fate

00:34:46.606 --> 00:34:50.677
of Europe and maybe for that
matter the fate of the rest of

00:34:50.677 --> 00:34:53.782
the world.
"It appears to me," he says,

00:34:53.782 --> 00:34:58.034
"beyond doubt that sooner or
later we shall arrive like the

00:34:58.034 --> 00:35:02.360
Americans at an almost complete
equality of conditions."

00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:05.675
He says, in the introduction,
that we shall arrive,

00:35:05.675 --> 00:35:07.929
speaking to his French
audience,

00:35:07.929 --> 00:35:13.382
a shocking statement again to
members of his class and of his

00:35:13.382 --> 00:35:17.184
family background,
that sooner or later we too

00:35:17.184 --> 00:35:20.050
will arrive at this complete
equality.

00:35:20.050 --> 00:35:24.133
He seems to ask the reader,
"Do you like what you see,

00:35:24.133 --> 00:35:27.591
what I describe?
What form democracy will take

00:35:27.591 --> 00:35:31.734
elsewhere will be very much
dependent upon circumstance and

00:35:31.734 --> 00:35:35.631
statesmanship."
Again, his is an attempt to

00:35:35.631 --> 00:35:38.920
educate statesmen for the
future.

00:35:46.690 --> 00:35:52.587
Let me say a few words,
and I will not finish this

00:35:52.587 --> 00:35:58.485
today but we'll take it
up--continue this a bit on

00:35:58.485 --> 00:36:01.835
Wednesday,
about what were the

00:36:01.835 --> 00:36:06.829
characteristics of American
democracy, what constitutes,

00:36:06.829 --> 00:36:11.819
as it were, democracy American
style as Tocqueville understood

00:36:11.819 --> 00:36:15.374
it, given that,
again, democracy has no single

00:36:15.374 --> 00:36:19.270
determinate form but is
characterized by a considerable

00:36:19.270 --> 00:36:21.940
degree of elasticity and
openness,

00:36:21.940 --> 00:36:26.693
what are the features that are
constitutive of American

00:36:26.693 --> 00:36:27.750
democracy.

00:36:33.289 --> 00:36:38.382
Condensing a vast amount of
material from-- especially from

00:36:38.382 --> 00:36:44.035
volume one of Democracy,
there are three features that I

00:36:44.035 --> 00:36:48.658
want to emphasize about the
unique characteristics of

00:36:48.658 --> 00:36:53.261
American democracy that lead to,
again, making it mild,

00:36:53.261 --> 00:36:56.650
gentle or what we might call a
liberal democracy.

00:36:56.650 --> 00:37:00.557
These are: local government,
civil associations,

00:37:00.557 --> 00:37:04.880
and what Tocqueville calls the
spirit of religion,

00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:08.780
and I want to talk about each
of these three in turn.

00:37:08.780 --> 00:37:11.866
I'll only probably talk about
the first one here,

00:37:11.866 --> 00:37:14.180
local government,
one of the parts of

00:37:14.180 --> 00:37:17.460
Tocqueville's book for which he
is most famous.

00:37:21.039 --> 00:37:23.140
The first and,
in many respects,

00:37:23.140 --> 00:37:26.663
most fundamental feature of
American democracy is the

00:37:26.663 --> 00:37:30.525
importance that Tocqueville
attributes to local government

00:37:30.525 --> 00:37:34.509
and local institutions,
the importance of localism,

00:37:34.509 --> 00:37:37.201
local democracies,
and you might say,

00:37:37.201 --> 00:37:41.688
the spirit that emanates from
it is the spirit--is the key to

00:37:41.688 --> 00:37:45.278
the whole.
The cradle of democracy is to

00:37:45.278 --> 00:37:50.385
be found in what Tocqueville
calls the commune or what in our

00:37:50.385 --> 00:37:53.620
translation is called the
township,

00:37:53.620 --> 00:37:57.496
the township democracy.
"It is nonetheless in the

00:37:57.496 --> 00:38:01.255
township," he writes,
"that the force of free peoples

00:38:01.255 --> 00:38:04.102
resides.
The institutions of a township

00:38:04.102 --> 00:38:07.659
are to freedom what primary
schools are to science.

00:38:07.659 --> 00:38:12.350
They put it within the reach of
the people."

00:38:12.350 --> 00:38:16.639
Does that sound at all familiar?
I think it should,

00:38:16.639 --> 00:38:20.443
in some respects.
Tocqueville's description of

00:38:20.443 --> 00:38:24.691
the New England township,
put within the reach of all the

00:38:24.691 --> 00:38:26.962
people,
clearly demonstrates the

00:38:26.962 --> 00:38:30.240
influence on Tocqueville of
Rousseau's account of the

00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:33.140
general will in the Social
Contract.

00:38:33.140 --> 00:38:35.913
Right?
It is the people organizing,

00:38:35.913 --> 00:38:38.744
legislating,
and deliberating over their

00:38:38.744 --> 00:38:42.230
common interests that is the
core of liberty.

00:38:42.230 --> 00:38:46.961
Tocqueville very much views the
American experience of local

00:38:46.961 --> 00:38:51.533
democracy through the lenses
shaped or crafted by Rousseau

00:38:51.533 --> 00:38:56.643
and this is hardly fortuitous.
In a famous letter to his

00:38:56.643 --> 00:39:00.362
friend Kergolay,
Tocqueville admits that

00:39:00.362 --> 00:39:05.702
Rousseau was one of three
writers with whom he spent some

00:39:05.702 --> 00:39:09.726
time every day.
He read Rousseau every day,

00:39:09.726 --> 00:39:12.626
the other two,
Montesquieu and Pascal,

00:39:12.626 --> 00:39:16.860
but it was Rousseau more than
any other figure who,

00:39:16.860 --> 00:39:22.061
again, helped him understand
the democratic experience and

00:39:22.061 --> 00:39:26.349
particularly this experience of
the township.

00:39:26.349 --> 00:39:29.339
Yet, in some ways,
Rousseau--Tocqueville combines

00:39:29.339 --> 00:39:31.829
Rousseau--his reading of the
township,

00:39:31.829 --> 00:39:35.646
his Rousseauian reading of the
township, with a kind of

00:39:35.646 --> 00:39:37.865
Aristotelian twist.
The township,

00:39:37.865 --> 00:39:40.353
he writes, he continues in that
same passage,

00:39:40.353 --> 00:39:43.349
is the sole association that is
so much in nature,

00:39:43.349 --> 00:39:47.707
he says, that everywhere men
are gathered,

00:39:47.707 --> 00:39:53.072
a township forms of itself.
That term "in nature," it is

00:39:53.072 --> 00:39:57.963
the sole association so much in
nature, should alert you to a

00:39:57.963 --> 00:40:02.610
kind of Aristotelianism in what
Tocqueville is saying.

00:40:02.610 --> 00:40:05.559
The township is here said to be
a product of nature.

00:40:05.559 --> 00:40:09.449
It eludes, he writes,
the effort of man.

00:40:09.449 --> 00:40:14.481
The township exists by nature
but its existence is far from

00:40:14.481 --> 00:40:18.227
being guaranteed.
It is fragile and it is

00:40:18.227 --> 00:40:21.514
uncertain.
It is continually threatened by

00:40:21.514 --> 00:40:25.863
invasions, not necessarily by
foreign powers but from larger

00:40:25.863 --> 00:40:29.769
forms of government,
state and federal government.

00:40:29.769 --> 00:40:33.495
The township is continually
threatened by federal and

00:40:33.495 --> 00:40:36.630
national authority.
And Tocqueville adds,

00:40:36.630 --> 00:40:40.201
with a definite hint of
Rousseau, that the more

00:40:40.201 --> 00:40:44.975
enlightened the people are,
the more difficult it is for

00:40:44.975 --> 00:40:48.730
them to retain the spirit of the
township.

00:40:48.730 --> 00:40:51.340
Think of that.
The more enlightened they are.

00:40:51.340 --> 00:40:57.408
The township relies on a
certain kind of spirit of local

00:40:57.408 --> 00:41:03.145
sturdy and steady habits,
not necessarily enlightened

00:41:03.145 --> 00:41:07.113
opinion.
That spirit of local freedom,

00:41:07.113 --> 00:41:11.489
again, goes hand in hand with a
kind of rustic,

00:41:11.489 --> 00:41:15.622
even primitive manners and
customs that clearly Rousseau

00:41:15.622 --> 00:41:19.904
would have admired and for this
reason he laments that the

00:41:19.904 --> 00:41:24.261
spirit of the township no longer
exists in Europe where the

00:41:24.261 --> 00:41:28.093
process of political
centralization and the progress

00:41:28.093 --> 00:41:32.525
of enlightenment have virtually
destroyed the conditions for

00:41:32.525 --> 00:41:34.930
local self-government.

00:41:41.619 --> 00:41:44.832
I'm going to end on that note
and Wednesday we're going to

00:41:44.832 --> 00:41:48.315
show a little movie again,
a little piece from a movie

00:41:48.315 --> 00:41:51.491
about--just a very,
very short clip which will

00:41:51.491 --> 00:41:55.585
illustrate the theme of civil
associations in democracy and

00:41:55.585 --> 00:41:59.325
we'll go on to talk about
religion and then some other

00:41:59.325 --> 00:42:02.000
parts of Rousseau.
Well, welcome back.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:04.066
It's nice to see you all here.

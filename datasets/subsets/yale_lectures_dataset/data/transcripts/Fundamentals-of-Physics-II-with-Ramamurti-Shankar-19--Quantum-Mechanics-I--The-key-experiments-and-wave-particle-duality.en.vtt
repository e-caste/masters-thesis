00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.510
Prof: So this is a very
exciting day for me,

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:09.976
because today,
we're going to start quantum

00:00:09.976 --> 00:00:15.010
mechanics and that's all we'll
do till the end of the term.

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:19.780
Now I've got bad news and good
news.

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:24.393
The bad news is that it's a
subject that's kind of hard to

00:00:24.393 --> 00:00:27.955
follow intuitively,
and the good news is that

00:00:27.955 --> 00:00:30.950
nobody can follow it
intuitively.

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:33.474
Richard Feynman,
one of the big figures in

00:00:33.474 --> 00:00:36.245
physics, used to say,
"No one understands

00:00:36.245 --> 00:00:37.970
quantum mechanics."
 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.574
So in some sense,
the pressure is off for you

00:00:40.574 --> 00:00:44.125
guys, because I don't get it and
you don't get it and Feynman

00:00:44.125 --> 00:00:45.250
doesn't get it.
 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.870
The point is, here is my goal.
 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.703
Right now, I'm the only one who
doesn't understand quantum

00:00:52.703 --> 00:00:53.510
mechanics.
 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.730
In about seven days,
all of you will be unable to

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.810
understand quantum mechanics.
 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:02.579
Then you can go back and spread
your ignorance everywhere else.

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.560
That's the only legacy a
teacher can want.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.959
All right, so that's the spirit
in which we are doing this.

00:01:09.959 --> 00:01:13.400
I want you to think about this
as a real adventure.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.640
Try to think beyond the exams
and grades and everything.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.762
It's one of the biggest
discoveries in physics,

00:01:20.762 --> 00:01:26.317
in science, and it's marvelous
how people even figured out this

00:01:26.317 --> 00:01:28.379
is what's going on.
 

00:01:28.379 --> 00:01:31.980
So I want to tell you in some
fashion, but not strictly

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:33.379
historical fashion.
 

00:01:33.379 --> 00:01:36.870
Purely historical fashion is
pedagogically not the best way,

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.920
because you go through all the
wrong tracks and get confused,

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.610
and there are a lot of battles
going on.

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.061
When the dust settles down,
a certain picture emerges and

00:01:46.061 --> 00:01:48.650
that's the picture I wanted to
give you.

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:52.372
In a way, I will appeal to
experiments that were perhaps

00:01:52.372 --> 00:01:55.959
not done in the sequence in
which I describe them,

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:58.569
but we know that if you did
them, this is what the answer

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:00.498
would be,
and everyone agrees,

00:02:00.498 --> 00:02:03.170
and they are the simplest
experiments.

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.930
All right, so today we're going
to shoot down Newtonian

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.840
mechanics and Maxwell's theory.
 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.060
So we are like the press.
 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.990
We build somebody up,
only to destroy them.

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:17.169
Built up Newton;
shot down.

00:02:17.169 --> 00:02:20.598
Built up Maxwell;
going to get shot down.

00:02:20.598 --> 00:02:24.795
So again, I have tried to drill
into all of you the notion that

00:02:24.795 --> 00:02:28.316
people get shot down because
somebody else does a new

00:02:28.316 --> 00:02:31.972
experiment that probes an
entirely new regime which had

00:02:31.972 --> 00:02:33.800
not been seen before.
 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.340
So it's not that people were
dumb;

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.615
it's that given the information
they had, they built the best

00:02:38.615 --> 00:02:39.979
theory that they could.
 

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:42.270
And if you give me more
additional information,

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.057
more refined measurements,
something to the tenth decimal

00:02:45.057 --> 00:02:47.150
place, I may have to change what
I do.

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:48.568
That's how it's going to be.
 

00:02:48.568 --> 00:02:50.348
So there's always going to
be--for example,

00:02:50.348 --> 00:02:53.366
in the big collider,
people are expecting to see new

00:02:53.366 --> 00:02:55.798
stuff,
hopefully stuff that hasn't

00:02:55.798 --> 00:02:58.538
been explained by any existing
theory.

00:02:58.538 --> 00:03:00.399
And we all want that,
because we want some

00:03:00.399 --> 00:03:02.438
excitement, we want to find out
new things.

00:03:02.438 --> 00:03:05.312
The best way not to worry about
your old theories is to not do

00:03:05.312 --> 00:03:06.159
any experiments.
 

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:08.379
Then you can go home.
 

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:09.590
But that's not how it goes.
 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.710
You probe more and more stuff.
 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:15.573
So here's what you do to find
out what's wrong with

00:03:15.573 --> 00:03:19.360
electrodynamics,
I mean, with Maxwell's theory.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.938
It all starts with a double
slit experiment.

00:03:22.938 --> 00:03:30.514
You have this famous double
slit and some waves are coming

00:03:30.514 --> 00:03:32.110
from here.
 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:35.970
You have some wavelength l.
 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:43.974
Then in the back,
I'm going to put a photographic

00:03:43.974 --> 00:03:45.310
plate.
 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.535
A photographic plate,
as you know,

00:03:47.535 --> 00:03:51.447
is made of these tiny little
pixels which change color when

00:03:51.447 --> 00:03:54.818
light hits them and then you see
your picture.

00:03:54.818 --> 00:03:59.110
And that's the way to detect
light, a perfectly good way to

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:00.218
detect light.
 

00:04:00.218 --> 00:04:03.587
So first thing we do is,
we block this hole or this

00:04:03.587 --> 00:04:04.060
slit.
 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:05.860
This is slit 1 and slit 2.
 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.594
We block this and we look at
what happened to the

00:04:09.594 --> 00:04:11.229
photographic plate.
 

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:17.660
What you will find is that the
region in front of it got pretty

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.500
dark,
or let's say had an image,

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.750
whereas if you go too far from
the slit,

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:25.769
you don't see anything.
 

00:04:25.769 --> 00:04:32.629
So that's called intensity,
when one is open.

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:39.589
Then you close that guy and you
get similar pattern.

00:04:39.589 --> 00:04:43.560
Then you open both.
 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.721
Then I told you,
you may expect that,

00:04:47.721 --> 00:04:54.774
but what you get instead--let's
see, I've got to pick my graph

00:04:54.774 --> 00:05:00.439
properly-- is something that
looks like this.

00:05:00.439 --> 00:05:03.586
Now that is the phenomenon of
interference,

00:05:03.586 --> 00:05:05.759
which we studied last time.
 

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:07.259
So what's the part that's funny?
 

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:11.781
What's the part that makes you
wonder is if you go to some

00:05:11.781 --> 00:05:15.670
location like this,
go to a location like this.

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:20.389
This used to be a bright
location when one slit was open.

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:23.081
It was also a bright location,
reasonably bright,

00:05:23.081 --> 00:05:24.819
when the other slit was open.
 

00:05:24.819 --> 00:05:28.839
But when both are open,
it becomes dark.

00:05:28.839 --> 00:05:31.374
You can ask,
"How can it be that I open

00:05:31.374 --> 00:05:33.259
two windows, room gets darker?
 

00:05:33.259 --> 00:05:35.728
Why doesn't it happen there,
and why does it happen

00:05:35.728 --> 00:05:36.370
here?"
 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:39.834
The answer is that you're
sending light of definite

00:05:39.834 --> 00:05:42.329
wavelength and the wave
function,

00:05:42.329 --> 00:05:44.829
Y, whatever measures the
oscillation,

00:05:44.829 --> 00:05:46.459
maybe electric field,
magnetic field,

00:05:46.459 --> 00:05:48.920
obeys the superposition
principle.

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:53.151
And when two slits are open,
what you're supposed to add is

00:05:53.151 --> 00:05:56.069
the electric field,
not the intensity.

00:05:56.069 --> 00:06:01.105
The intensity is proportional
to the square of the electric

00:06:01.105 --> 00:06:01.800
field.
 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.769
You don't add E^(2);
you add E.

00:06:03.769 --> 00:06:05.920
E is what obeys the wave
equation.

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:08.584
E_1 is a
solution, E_2

00:06:08.584 --> 00:06:09.360
is a solution.
 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.223
E_1
E_2 is a

00:06:11.223 --> 00:06:11.680
solution.
 

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:14.153
No one tells you that if you
add the two sources,

00:06:14.153 --> 00:06:16.627
I_1
I_2 is going to be

00:06:16.627 --> 00:06:17.709
the final answer.
 

00:06:17.709 --> 00:06:19.959
The correct answer is to find
E_1

00:06:19.959 --> 00:06:21.980
E_2 and then
square that.

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:22.863
But when you do
E_1

00:06:22.863 --> 00:06:24.579
E_2,
since E_1 and

00:06:24.579 --> 00:06:26.839
E_2 are not
necessarily positive definite,

00:06:26.839 --> 00:06:29.187
when you add them,
sometimes they can add with the

00:06:29.187 --> 00:06:31.043
same sign,
sometimes they can add with

00:06:31.043 --> 00:06:33.324
opposite signs,
and sometimes in between,

00:06:33.324 --> 00:06:34.829
so you get this pattern.
 

00:06:34.829 --> 00:06:36.560
So we're not surprised.
 

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:39.192
And I've told you many times
why we don't see it when we open

00:06:39.192 --> 00:06:40.690
big windows,
first of all,

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:43.971
when you open a window,
the slit sizes are all many,

00:06:43.971 --> 00:06:47.649
many, many million times bigger
than the wavelength of light.

00:06:47.649 --> 00:06:50.040
Plus the light is not just one
color and so on.

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:52.740
So you don't pick up these
oscillations.

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:55.339
These oscillations are very
fine.

00:06:55.339 --> 00:06:57.940
I draw them this way so you can
see them.

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:00.476
In a real life thing,
if this were really windows and

00:07:00.476 --> 00:07:02.430
this was the back wall of your
house,

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:04.850
the oscillations would be so
tightly spaced,

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:07.656
I'll just draw some of them,
that the human eye cannot

00:07:07.656 --> 00:07:09.139
detect these oscillations.
 

00:07:09.139 --> 00:07:11.060
It will only pick up the
average value.

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:15.326
The average value will in fact
look like I_1

00:07:15.326 --> 00:07:16.850
I_2.
 

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:18.540
So this is all very nice.
 

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:21.740
This is how Young discovered
that light is a wave.

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:24.290
By doing the interference,
I told you,

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:26.843
he could even find a
wavelength, because it's a

00:07:26.843 --> 00:07:30.285
simple matter of geometry to see
where you've got to go for two

00:07:30.285 --> 00:07:31.339
guys to cancel.
 

00:07:31.339 --> 00:07:34.687
And once you know that angle,
you know where on that screen

00:07:34.687 --> 00:07:36.879
you will get a minimum or a
maximum.

00:07:36.879 --> 00:07:37.819
So you've got the wavelength.
 

00:07:37.819 --> 00:07:39.230
He didn't know what was doing
it.

00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:41.105
He didn't know it was
electromagnetic,

00:07:41.105 --> 00:07:42.779
but you can get the wavelength.
 

00:07:42.779 --> 00:07:47.170
So interference is a hallmark
of waves.

00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:49.009
Any wave will do interference.
 

00:07:49.009 --> 00:07:51.050
Water will do the same thing.
 

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:55.870
For example,
this is your beach house.

00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:57.639
You've got some ocean front
property.

00:07:57.639 --> 00:08:01.730
This is a little lagoon and you
have a wall to keep the ocean

00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:03.639
waves out of your mansion.
 

00:08:03.639 --> 00:08:09.750
And then suddenly one day,
there is a break in the wall.

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:12.855
Break in the wall,
the waves start coming in and

00:08:12.855 --> 00:08:16.819
you're having a little boat
here, trying to get some rest.

00:08:16.819 --> 00:08:20.939
The boat starts jumping up and
down because of the waves.

00:08:20.939 --> 00:08:22.709
So you have two options.
 

00:08:22.709 --> 00:08:25.651
One options is to go and try to
plug that thing,

00:08:25.651 --> 00:08:28.466
but let's say you've got no
bricks, no mortar,

00:08:28.466 --> 00:08:29.970
no time, no nothing.
 

00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:31.329
You've just got a sledgehammer.
 

00:08:31.329 --> 00:08:35.558
What you can do,
you can make another hole.

00:08:35.558 --> 00:08:38.452
If these water waves are a
definite wavelength,

00:08:38.452 --> 00:08:41.344
only in that case,
you can make another hole so

00:08:41.344 --> 00:08:43.860
these two add up to 0 where you
are.

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:46.384
Similarly, if you don't like
the music your roommate's

00:08:46.384 --> 00:08:48.277
playing,
if you can manufacture the same

00:08:48.277 --> 00:08:51.761
music with a phase shift of p,
you can add them together,

00:08:51.761 --> 00:08:52.639
you get 0.
 

00:08:52.639 --> 00:08:55.996
But you've got to figure out
what the roommate's about to do

00:08:55.996 --> 00:08:58.158
and be synchronous with the
person,

00:08:58.158 --> 00:09:01.830
but get a wavelength of p--I
mean, a phase shift of p.

00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:03.278
So you can cancel waves.
 

00:09:03.278 --> 00:09:06.740
That's the idea behind all
kinds of noise cancelation,

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:10.333
but you've got to know the
exact phase of the one signal

00:09:10.333 --> 00:09:12.490
that you're trying to cancel.
 

00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:15.898
All right, so everything looks
good for Maxwell,

00:09:15.898 --> 00:09:19.379
till you start doing the
following experiment.

00:09:19.379 --> 00:09:23.822
You make the source of light,
whatever it is,

00:09:23.822 --> 00:09:26.450
dimmer and dimmer,
okay?

00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:29.500
So you may not be able to turn
down the brightness.

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:31.472
Maybe you can,
maybe you cannot,

00:09:31.472 --> 00:09:35.610
but you can imagine moving the
source further and further back.

00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:39.773
You move it further and further
back, you know the energy falls

00:09:39.773 --> 00:09:42.929
like 1/r^(2),
so you can make it weak.

00:09:42.929 --> 00:09:44.559
So here's what we try to do.
 

00:09:44.559 --> 00:09:48.548
We put a new photographic film.
 

00:09:48.548 --> 00:09:54.673
We take the light source way
back, then we wait for something

00:09:54.673 --> 00:09:55.899
to happen.
 

00:09:55.899 --> 00:09:59.009
We come the next morning,
we find there's a very faint

00:09:59.009 --> 00:10:02.413
pattern that's taken place over
night, because the film got

00:10:02.413 --> 00:10:04.409
exposed all through the night.
 

00:10:04.409 --> 00:10:07.000
Now we can see a faint pattern.
 

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.629
Then you go and turn it down
even more.

00:10:10.629 --> 00:10:14.340
You come back the next day,
you look at the film.

00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:18.251
You find no pattern,
just two or three spots which

00:10:18.251 --> 00:10:19.850
have been exposed.
 

00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:23.364
If you look at the screen--so
let me show you a view of the

00:10:23.364 --> 00:10:23.908
screen.
 

00:10:23.908 --> 00:10:27.071
Normally you will have bright
and dark and bright and dark

00:10:27.071 --> 00:10:30.399
patterns on the back wall if you
turn on a powerful light.

00:10:30.399 --> 00:10:33.119
But I'm telling you,
if you have a really weak

00:10:33.119 --> 00:10:36.684
source, you just find that got
exposed, that got exposed and

00:10:36.684 --> 00:10:38.620
that got exposed,
that's it.

00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:44.240
Only three points on the film
are exposed, and that is very

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:45.210
strange.
 

00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:49.568
Because if light is a wave,
no matter how weak it is,

00:10:49.568 --> 00:10:52.418
it should hit the entire
screen.

00:10:52.418 --> 00:10:53.889
It cannot hit certain parts of
it.

00:10:53.889 --> 00:10:56.918
Waves don't hit certain parts.
 

00:10:56.918 --> 00:10:58.580
In fact, how can it hit just
one?

00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:00.835
For example,
if you make it weak enough,

00:11:00.835 --> 00:11:03.553
you can have a situation where
in the whole day,

00:11:03.553 --> 00:11:05.000
you just get one hit.
 

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.399
So something is hitting that
screen and it's not a wave,

00:11:07.399 --> 00:11:11.008
because a wave is spread out
over its full transverse

00:11:11.008 --> 00:11:14.816
dimension,
but this is hitting one point

00:11:14.816 --> 00:11:16.320
on the screen.
 

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:20.166
So you make further
observations and you find out

00:11:20.166 --> 00:11:25.134
that what happens here is there
is a certain amount of momentum

00:11:25.134 --> 00:11:28.740
and energy are delivered during
that hit.

00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:32.235
If you could measure the recoil
of that film,

00:11:32.235 --> 00:11:36.764
you will find it gets hit and
the momentum you get per hit

00:11:36.764 --> 00:11:40.259
looks like ℏ x
k.

00:11:40.259 --> 00:11:42.120
I'll tell you what it means.
 

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:44.735
This is 2p
h/l,

00:11:44.735 --> 00:11:48.033
where l is your
wavelength, h is the new

00:11:48.033 --> 00:11:50.649
constant called the Planck's
constant.

00:11:50.649 --> 00:11:59.990
And its value is 6.6 x 10^(-34
)joule seconds.

00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:03.259
You also find,
every time you get a hit here,

00:12:03.259 --> 00:12:06.330
there's a certain energy
deposited here and the energy

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:09.748
deposited here happens to be
ℏw where

00:12:09.748 --> 00:12:12.345
w,
as you know,

00:12:12.345 --> 00:12:15.620
is 2pf.
 

00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:18.408
So here's what I'm telling you.
 

00:12:18.408 --> 00:12:23.807
If you send light of a known
frequency and known wavelength

00:12:23.807 --> 00:12:28.618
and you make it extremely dim,
and you put a photographic

00:12:28.618 --> 00:12:31.558
plate and you wait till
something happens,

00:12:31.558 --> 00:12:35.279
what happens is not a thin blur
over the whole screen.

00:12:35.279 --> 00:12:38.259
What happens is a hit at one
location.

00:12:38.259 --> 00:12:41.429
And what comes to that location
seems to be a bundle of energy

00:12:41.429 --> 00:12:42.470
and momentum,
i.e.

00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:44.418
a particle, right?
 

00:12:44.418 --> 00:12:47.186
When something hits you in the
face, it's got energy,

00:12:47.186 --> 00:12:48.250
it's got momentum.
 

00:12:48.250 --> 00:12:51.423
So this film is getting hit at
one point by a particle,

00:12:51.423 --> 00:12:54.893
and what we can say about the
particle is the following - it

00:12:54.893 --> 00:12:56.009
has a momentum.
 

00:12:56.009 --> 00:12:59.668
It has the same momentum every
time.

00:12:59.668 --> 00:13:00.908
You get this hit,
you get that hit,

00:13:00.908 --> 00:13:01.600
you get that hit.
 

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:05.485
As long as you don't screw
around with the wavelength of

00:13:05.485 --> 00:13:08.734
incoming light,
the momentum and energy of each

00:13:08.734 --> 00:13:10.428
packet is identical.
 

00:13:10.428 --> 00:13:12.610
It's more than saying light
seems to be made of particles.

00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:15.576
Made of particles,
each one of them carries an

00:13:15.576 --> 00:13:19.136
energy and momentum that's
absolutely correlated with a

00:13:19.136 --> 00:13:21.048
wavelength and frequency.
 

00:13:21.048 --> 00:13:30.561
Now let me remind you that
w = kc for light

00:13:30.561 --> 00:13:31.918
waves.
 

00:13:31.918 --> 00:13:33.740
We've done this many,
many times.

00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:36.476
That means the energy,
which is

00:13:36.476 --> 00:13:40.580
ℏw,
and the momentum is

00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:44.774
ℏk,
are related by the relation

00:13:44.774 --> 00:13:46.600
E = pc.
 

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:50.687
So these particles have a
momentum which is related to

00:13:50.687 --> 00:13:53.620
energy by the formula E =
pc.

00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:58.275
When you go back to your
relativity notes from the last

00:13:58.275 --> 00:14:03.019
semester, you'll find the
following relation is true.

00:14:03.019 --> 00:14:06.724
Any particle,
E^(2) = c^(2)p^(2)

00:14:06.724 --> 00:14:09.340
m^(2)c^(4).
 

00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:14.668
That's the connection between
energy and momentum.

00:14:14.668 --> 00:14:19.450
Therefore this looks like a
particle whose m is 0.

00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:23.419
If m is 0, E = pc.
 

00:14:23.419 --> 00:14:26.048
So these particles are massless.
 

00:14:26.048 --> 00:14:29.581
They have no rest mass and you
know, something with no rest

00:14:29.581 --> 00:14:32.932
mass, if it is to have a
momentum, it must travel at the

00:14:32.932 --> 00:14:34.090
speed of light.
 

00:14:34.090 --> 00:14:38.355
Because normally,
the momentum of anything with

00:14:38.355 --> 00:14:41.509
mass is mv,
in the old days,

00:14:41.509 --> 00:14:44.850
divided by this,
after Einstein.

00:14:44.850 --> 00:14:48.428
And if you don't want to have
an m, and yet you want to

00:14:48.428 --> 00:14:51.068
have a p,
the only way it can happen is

00:14:51.068 --> 00:14:52.360
that v = c.
 

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:54.597
Then you have 0/0,
there is some chance,

00:14:54.597 --> 00:14:57.408
and nature seems to take
advantage of that 0/0.

00:14:57.408 --> 00:14:59.529
These are the massless
particles.

00:14:59.529 --> 00:15:06.580
So these photons are massless
particles.

00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:08.490
So what is the shock?
 

00:15:08.490 --> 00:15:12.402
The shock is that light,
which you thought was a

00:15:12.402 --> 00:15:16.313
continuous wave,
is actually made up of discrete

00:15:16.313 --> 00:15:17.480
particles.
 

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:20.076
In order to see them,
your light source has to be

00:15:20.076 --> 00:15:22.923
extremely weak,
because if you turn on a light

00:15:22.923 --> 00:15:26.274
source like this one,
millions of these photons come

00:15:26.274 --> 00:15:29.019
and the pattern is formed
instantaneously.

00:15:29.019 --> 00:15:31.558
The minute you turn on the
light, the film is exposed,

00:15:31.558 --> 00:15:34.350
you see these dark and light
and dark and light fringes,

00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:37.529
you think it's happening due to
waves that come instantaneously.

00:15:37.529 --> 00:15:41.708
But if you look under the hood,
every pattern is formed by tiny

00:15:41.708 --> 00:15:45.620
little dots which occur so fast
that you don't see them.

00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:49.168
That's where you've got to turn
down the intensity to actually

00:15:49.168 --> 00:15:49.808
see them.
 

00:15:49.808 --> 00:15:56.090
When you see that,
you see the corpuscular nature

00:15:56.090 --> 00:15:57.529
of light.
 

00:15:57.529 --> 00:16:00.456
But here is the problem - if
somebody told you light is made

00:16:00.456 --> 00:16:02.440
of particles and it's not
continuous,

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:05.548
it's not so disturbing,
because water,

00:16:05.548 --> 00:16:08.807
which you think is continuous,
is actually made of water

00:16:08.807 --> 00:16:09.519
molecules.
 

00:16:09.519 --> 00:16:12.331
Everything that you think of as
continuous is made up of little

00:16:12.331 --> 00:16:15.522
molecules and in a bigger scale,
much bigger than the atomic or

00:16:15.522 --> 00:16:18.899
molecular size,
it looks like it's continuous.

00:16:18.899 --> 00:16:21.320
That's not the bad news.
 

00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:28.120
The bad news really has to do
with the fact that if you have

00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:34.490
these particles called photons,
if it really were a particle,

00:16:34.490 --> 00:16:38.110
namely a standard,
garden variety particle,

00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:39.879
what should you find?
 

00:16:39.879 --> 00:16:44.259
If you emit a particle from
here, and only one slit is open,

00:16:44.259 --> 00:16:48.416
it will take some path going
through the slit and it will

00:16:48.416 --> 00:16:49.529
come there.
 

00:16:49.529 --> 00:16:54.094
So let us say on a given day,
10 photons will come here,

00:16:54.094 --> 00:16:59.240
or let's say 4 photons will
come here, with this one closed.

00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:02.548
Then let's close this one and
open this one.

00:17:02.548 --> 00:17:06.160
In that, case,
maybe 3 photons will come here.

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:09.328
Or let's say again, 4.
 

00:17:09.328 --> 00:17:18.170
Now I'm claiming that when both
are open, I get no photons.

00:17:18.170 --> 00:17:22.060
How can it be that when you
open a second hole,

00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:25.358
you get fewer particles coming
there?

00:17:25.358 --> 00:17:32.339
Particles normally either take
path number 1 or path number 2.

00:17:32.339 --> 00:17:34.980
Either this slit or this slit.
 

00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:38.165
To all the guys going this way,
they don't care if this slit is

00:17:38.165 --> 00:17:39.038
open or closed.
 

00:17:39.038 --> 00:17:40.630
They don't even know about the
other slit.

00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:43.567
They do their thing,
and guys going through this

00:17:43.567 --> 00:17:46.881
slit should do their thing,
therefore you should get a

00:17:46.881 --> 00:17:49.568
number equal to the sum,
but you don't.

00:17:49.568 --> 00:17:51.384
In other words,
for particles,

00:17:51.384 --> 00:17:53.388
which have definite
trajectories,

00:17:53.388 --> 00:17:56.834
opening a second slit should
not affect the number going

00:17:56.834 --> 00:17:58.650
through the first slit.
 

00:17:58.650 --> 00:17:59.269
Do you understand that?
 

00:17:59.269 --> 00:18:01.068
Particles are local.
 

00:18:01.068 --> 00:18:03.836
They're moving along and they
feel the local forces acting on

00:18:03.836 --> 00:18:05.588
them and they bend or twist or
turn.

00:18:05.588 --> 00:18:07.830
They don't really care what's
happening far away,

00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:09.980
whether a second slit may be
open or closed.

00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:13.686
Therefore logically,
the number coming here must be

00:18:13.686 --> 00:18:18.358
the sum of the number that would
come with 1 open and 2 open.

00:18:18.358 --> 00:18:20.550
How can you cancel a positive
number of particles coming

00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:22.902
somewhere with more positive
number of particles coming from

00:18:22.902 --> 00:18:23.660
somewhere else?
 

00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:25.500
How do you get a 0?
 

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:29.598
That is where the wave comes in.
 

00:18:29.598 --> 00:18:32.463
The wave has no trouble knowing
how many slits are open,

00:18:32.463 --> 00:18:34.339
because the wave is not
localized.

00:18:34.339 --> 00:18:36.048
The wave comes like this.
 

00:18:36.048 --> 00:18:39.435
It can hit both the slits and
certainly cares about how many

00:18:39.435 --> 00:18:40.470
slits there are.
 

00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:43.500
Because there's only one,
that wave will go.

00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:45.628
You'll have some amplitude
here, which is kind of

00:18:45.628 --> 00:18:46.250
featureless.
 

00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:47.750
If that's open,
it will be featureless.

00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:53.348
If both are open,
there'll be interference.

00:18:53.348 --> 00:18:59.396
So we need that wave to
understand what the photon will

00:18:59.396 --> 00:19:01.760
do,
because when you send millions

00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:04.578
of photons and if you get the
pattern like this--

00:19:04.578 --> 00:19:07.881
let's say you sent lots and
lots of photons and you got a

00:19:07.881 --> 00:19:09.058
pattern like this.
 

00:19:09.058 --> 00:19:14.039
Now I'm going to send million 1
photon.

00:19:14.039 --> 00:19:17.690
Where will it go?
 

00:19:17.690 --> 00:19:20.088
We do not know where it will go.
 

00:19:20.088 --> 00:19:24.480
We only know that if you repeat
the experiment a million times,

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:26.108
you get this pattern.
 

00:19:26.108 --> 00:19:28.990
But on the million 1th attempt,
where it will go,

00:19:28.990 --> 00:19:29.950
we don't know.
 

00:19:29.950 --> 00:19:34.098
We just know that the odds are
high when the function is high,

00:19:34.098 --> 00:19:36.876
or the intensity,
and the odds are low when the

00:19:36.876 --> 00:19:40.618
function is small and the odds
are 0 when the function is 0.

00:19:40.618 --> 00:19:45.734
So the role of the wave is to
determine the probability that

00:19:45.734 --> 00:19:50.328
the photon will arrive at some
point on the screen.

00:19:50.328 --> 00:19:54.854
And the probability is computed
by adding one wave function to

00:19:54.854 --> 00:19:57.970
another wave function and then
squaring.

00:19:57.970 --> 00:19:58.950
So you've got to be very clear.
 

00:19:58.950 --> 00:20:02.520
If someone says to you,
"Is the photon a particle

00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:03.328
or a wave?
 

00:20:03.328 --> 00:20:06.440
Make up your mind,
what is it?"

00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:10.491
Well, the answer is,
it's not going to be a yes or

00:20:10.491 --> 00:20:11.650
no question.
 

00:20:11.650 --> 00:20:13.267
People always ask you,
"Is matter made of

00:20:13.267 --> 00:20:14.703
particles or waves,
electron particles or

00:20:14.703 --> 00:20:15.278
waves?"
 

00:20:15.278 --> 00:20:18.448
Well, sometimes the vocabulary
we have is not big enough to

00:20:18.448 --> 00:20:20.359
describe what's really
happening.

00:20:20.359 --> 00:20:22.299
It is what it is.
 

00:20:22.299 --> 00:20:23.769
It is the following.
 

00:20:23.769 --> 00:20:27.770
It is a particle in the sense
that the entire energy is

00:20:27.770 --> 00:20:31.548
carried in these localized
places, unlike a wave.

00:20:31.548 --> 00:20:35.409
When the wave hits the beach,
the energy's over the entire

00:20:35.409 --> 00:20:36.288
wave front.
 

00:20:36.288 --> 00:20:39.210
This wave here is not a
physical wave.

00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:42.996
It does not carry any energy
and it's not even a property of

00:20:42.996 --> 00:20:44.279
a beam of photons.
 

00:20:44.279 --> 00:20:47.000
It's a property of one photon.
 

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:51.059
Here's what I want you to
understand - you send one photon

00:20:51.059 --> 00:20:54.194
at a time, many,
many times, and you get this

00:20:54.194 --> 00:20:55.048
pattern.
 

00:20:55.048 --> 00:20:59.217
Each time you throw the die and
ask where will the photon land,

00:20:59.217 --> 00:21:03.182
this function is waiting to
tell you the probability it will

00:21:03.182 --> 00:21:04.460
land somewhere.
 

00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:06.490
So we have to play this game in
two ways.

00:21:06.490 --> 00:21:09.805
It is particles,
but its future is determined by

00:21:09.805 --> 00:21:10.440
a wave.
 

00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:12.430
The wave is purely mathematical.
 

00:21:12.430 --> 00:21:15.329
You cannot put an instrument
that measures the energy due to

00:21:15.329 --> 00:21:15.920
that wave.
 

00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:20.273
It's a construct we use to
determine what will happen in

00:21:20.273 --> 00:21:21.700
this experiment.
 

00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:24.843
So we have no trouble
predicting this experiment,

00:21:24.843 --> 00:21:27.660
but we only make statistical
predictions.

00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:30.290
So if someone tells you,
"I got light from some

00:21:30.290 --> 00:21:33.325
mercury vapor or something,
it's got a certain wavelength,

00:21:33.325 --> 00:21:34.858
therefore a certain frequency.
 

00:21:34.858 --> 00:21:38.838
I'm going to take two slits and
I'm going to send the light from

00:21:38.838 --> 00:21:41.430
the left so weak that at a given
time,

00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:45.240
only one photon leaves the
source and hits the screen.

00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:47.098
What will happen?"
 

00:21:47.098 --> 00:21:49.538
We will say we don't know what
it will do.

00:21:49.538 --> 00:21:51.308
We don't know where it will
land.

00:21:51.308 --> 00:21:53.555
But we tell you if you do it
enough times,

00:21:53.555 --> 00:21:56.240
millions of times,
soon a pattern will develop.

00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:58.865
Namely, if you plot your
histogram on where everybody

00:21:58.865 --> 00:22:00.328
landed, you'll get a graph.
 

00:22:00.328 --> 00:22:02.980
It's the graph that I can
predict.

00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:04.500
And how do I predict that graph.
 

00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:09.070
I say, "What was the
energy momentum of your

00:22:09.070 --> 00:22:10.500
photon?"
 

00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:15.141
If it was p,
I will introduce a wave whose

00:22:15.141 --> 00:22:19.298
momentum is
2pℏ/p.

00:22:19.298 --> 00:22:20.969
Oh, I'm sorry,
I forgot to tell you guys one

00:22:20.969 --> 00:22:21.279
thing.
 

00:22:21.279 --> 00:22:21.980
I apologize.
 

00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:25.180
I've been writing
ℏ and h.

00:22:25.180 --> 00:22:28.935
I should have mentioned it long
back, ℏ is

00:22:28.935 --> 00:22:30.318
h/2p.
 

00:22:30.318 --> 00:22:32.733
Since the combination occurs so
often, people write

00:22:32.733 --> 00:22:33.700
ℏ.
 

00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:37.338
So you can write l =
2pℏ/p,

00:22:37.338 --> 00:22:38.380
or h/p.
 

00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:40.309
It doesn't matter.
 

00:22:40.309 --> 00:22:41.640
So I've stopped using h.
 

00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:44.750
Most people now in the business
use ℏ,

00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:47.509
because the energy is
ℏw,

00:22:47.509 --> 00:22:49.798
the momentum is
ℏk.

00:22:49.798 --> 00:22:51.857
If you want,
you can write this

00:22:51.857 --> 00:22:55.700
2phk and k
is 2p/l.

00:22:55.700 --> 00:22:57.818
Then you find p is
h/l.

00:22:57.818 --> 00:23:00.559
That's how some people used to
write it in the old days,

00:23:00.559 --> 00:23:03.798
but now we write it in terms of
ℏ and k.

00:23:03.798 --> 00:23:08.417
Anyway, I can make these
predictions, if I knew the

00:23:08.417 --> 00:23:10.818
momentum of the photons.
 

00:23:10.818 --> 00:23:12.728
The photons were of a definite
momentum, therefore there's a

00:23:12.728 --> 00:23:13.440
definite wavelength.
 

00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:19.000
I can predict the interference
pattern.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:22.339
So where is the photon when it
goes from start to finish?

00:23:22.339 --> 00:23:23.108
We don't know.
 

00:23:23.108 --> 00:23:25.220
I'll come back to that question
now.

00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:29.142
But I want to mention to you a
historical fact,

00:23:29.142 --> 00:23:33.236
which is, photons were not
really found this way,

00:23:33.236 --> 00:23:37.500
by looking at the recoil of an
emulsion plate.

00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:40.878
Just for completeness,
I'm going to make a five minute

00:23:40.878 --> 00:23:43.940
digression to tell you how
photons were found.

00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:46.160
So they were actually predicted
by Einstein.

00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:48.886
He got the Nobel Prize for
predicting the photon,

00:23:48.886 --> 00:23:52.067
rather than for the Theory of
Relativity, which was still

00:23:52.067 --> 00:23:53.828
controversial at that time.
 

00:23:53.828 --> 00:23:57.957
So he predicted the photons,
based on actually fairly

00:23:57.957 --> 00:24:02.720
complicated thermodynamic
statistical mechanics arguments.

00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:06.854
But one way to understand it is
in terms of what's called the

00:24:06.854 --> 00:24:08.440
photoelectric effect.
 

00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:12.375
If you take a metal and you say
"Where are the electrons in

00:24:12.375 --> 00:24:13.500
the metal?"
 

00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:17.470
As you know most electrons are
orbiting the parent nucleus.

00:24:17.470 --> 00:24:20.710
But in a metal,
some electrons are communal.

00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:24.430
Each atom donates one or two
electrons to the whole metal.

00:24:24.430 --> 00:24:26.700
They can run all over the metal.
 

00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:29.400
They don't have to be near
their parent nucleus.

00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:31.369
They cannot leave the metal.
 

00:24:31.369 --> 00:24:33.450
So in a way, they are like this.
 

00:24:33.450 --> 00:24:36.734
There's a little tank whose
depth is h,

00:24:36.734 --> 00:24:40.460
and let's say mgh I want
to call W.

00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:44.069
So these guys are somewhere in
the bottom.

00:24:44.069 --> 00:24:48.568
They can run around;
they cannot get out.

00:24:48.568 --> 00:24:51.998
So if you want to yank an
electron out of the metal,

00:24:51.998 --> 00:24:54.954
you have to give an energy
equal to W,

00:24:54.954 --> 00:24:57.509
which is called the work
function.

00:24:57.509 --> 00:25:00.740
So how are you going to get an
electron to acquire some energy?

00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:01.480
We all know.
 

00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:03.608
Electron is an electric charge.
 

00:25:03.608 --> 00:25:06.386
I have to apply an electric
field and I know electromagnetic

00:25:06.386 --> 00:25:08.930
waves are nothing but electric
and magnetic fields,

00:25:08.930 --> 00:25:11.960
so I shine a light,
a source of light,

00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:13.528
towards this.
 

00:25:13.528 --> 00:25:16.281
The electric field comes and
grabs the electron and shakes it

00:25:16.281 --> 00:25:16.650
loose.
 

00:25:16.650 --> 00:25:19.808
Hopefully it will shake it
loose from the metal,

00:25:19.808 --> 00:25:22.230
giving it enough energy to
escape.

00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:26.650
And once it escapes,
it can take off.

00:25:26.650 --> 00:25:30.607
So they took some light source
and they aimed it at the metal,

00:25:30.607 --> 00:25:32.619
to see if electrons come out.
 

00:25:32.619 --> 00:25:35.038
They didn't.
 

00:25:35.038 --> 00:25:41.490
So what do you think you will
do to get some action?

00:25:41.490 --> 00:25:42.009
Yes?
 

00:25:42.009 --> 00:25:44.578
Student: 
&gt;

00:25:44.578 --> 00:25:46.269
Prof: So you make it
brighter.

00:25:46.269 --> 00:25:47.657
You say, "Okay,
let me crank up--"

00:25:47.657 --> 00:25:48.660
that's what anybody would do.
 

00:25:48.660 --> 00:25:51.496
They cranked up the intensity
of light, make it brighter and

00:25:51.496 --> 00:25:52.650
brighter and brighter.
 

00:25:52.650 --> 00:25:55.808
Nothing happened.
 

00:25:55.808 --> 00:25:59.669
Then by accident they found out
that instead of cranking up the

00:25:59.669 --> 00:26:03.305
brightness of the light,
if you cranked up the frequency

00:26:03.305 --> 00:26:06.576
of light,
slowly, suddenly beyond some

00:26:06.576 --> 00:26:09.724
frequency,
you start getting electrons

00:26:09.724 --> 00:26:11.240
escaping the metal.
 

00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:16.818
So here's the graph you get.
 

00:26:16.818 --> 00:26:19.884
Let me just plot it if you
like, ℏ times

00:26:19.884 --> 00:26:20.720
the w.
 

00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:22.880
In those days,
they didn't know too much about

00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:23.839
ℏ.
 

00:26:23.839 --> 00:26:24.799
You can even plot w.
 

00:26:24.799 --> 00:26:26.118
It doesn't matter.
 

00:26:26.118 --> 00:26:31.220
And you plot here the kinetic
energy of the emitted electron.

00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:35.287
And what you find is that below
some minimum value,

00:26:35.287 --> 00:26:37.240
no electrons come out.
 

00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:39.640
There's nothing to plot.
 

00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:44.567
And once you cross a magical
w, and anything higher

00:26:44.567 --> 00:26:48.976
than that, you get a kinetic
energy that's linear in

00:26:48.976 --> 00:26:50.098
w.
 

00:26:50.098 --> 00:26:59.270
Now the kinetic energy is the
energy you gave to the electron

00:26:59.270 --> 00:27:01.868
minus W.
 

00:27:01.868 --> 00:27:05.250
Energy given to the electron -
W, because you paid

00:27:05.250 --> 00:27:08.750
W to get it out of the
well, and whatever is left is

00:27:08.750 --> 00:27:10.140
the kinetic energy.
 

00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:13.480
So Einstein predicted photons
from independent arguments,

00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:16.051
and according to him,
light and frequency w is

00:27:16.051 --> 00:27:19.295
made up of particles,
each of which contains energy

00:27:19.295 --> 00:27:21.210
ℏw.
 

00:27:21.210 --> 00:27:23.818
So you can see what's happening.
 

00:27:23.818 --> 00:27:27.738
If you've got low frequency
light, you're sending millions

00:27:27.738 --> 00:27:31.313
of photons, each carries an
energy ℏw

00:27:31.313 --> 00:27:32.618
somewhere here.
 

00:27:32.618 --> 00:27:35.563
None of them has the energy to
lift the electron out of the

00:27:35.563 --> 00:27:35.970
metal.
 

00:27:35.970 --> 00:27:40.596
It's like sending a million
little kids to lift something

00:27:40.596 --> 00:27:42.578
and they cannot do it.
 

00:27:42.578 --> 00:27:46.238
They cannot do it,
but if you send 10 tall,

00:27:46.238 --> 00:27:49.808
powerful people,
they will lift it out.

00:27:49.808 --> 00:27:53.096
So what's happening with light
is that as you crank up the

00:27:53.096 --> 00:27:55.227
w,
even if it's not very bright,

00:27:55.227 --> 00:27:57.952
the individual packets are
carrying more and more energy

00:27:57.952 --> 00:28:01.157
and more and more momentum,
and that's why they succeed in

00:28:01.157 --> 00:28:02.660
knocking the electron out.
 

00:28:02.660 --> 00:28:04.862
And in fact,
if you set the energy of each

00:28:04.862 --> 00:28:06.836
photon,
it's ℏw,

00:28:06.836 --> 00:28:09.664
then the kinetic energy of the
electron is the energy you gave

00:28:09.664 --> 00:28:11.602
with 1 photon,
take away the W,

00:28:11.602 --> 00:28:13.759
that's the price you pay to
leave the metal.

00:28:13.759 --> 00:28:16.240
The rest of it is kinetic
energy.

00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:19.319
So when plotted as a function
of w, K should

00:28:19.319 --> 00:28:22.130
look like a straight line with
intercept W.

00:28:22.130 --> 00:28:23.920
And that's what you find.
 

00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:27.700
In fact, this is one way to
measure the work function.

00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:30.800
How much energy do we need to
rip an electron out of a metal

00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:32.009
depends on the metal.
 

00:28:32.009 --> 00:28:34.490
And you shine light and you
crank up the frequency,

00:28:34.490 --> 00:28:35.730
till something happens.
 

00:28:35.730 --> 00:28:39.096
And just to be sure,
you go a little beyond that and

00:28:39.096 --> 00:28:42.730
you find that the kinetic energy
grows linearly in w.

00:28:42.730 --> 00:28:46.165
Anyway, this is how one
confirmed the existence,

00:28:46.165 --> 00:28:48.578
indirect existence,
of photons.

00:28:48.578 --> 00:28:52.376
There's another experiment that
also confirmed the existence of

00:28:52.376 --> 00:28:52.990
photons.
 

00:28:52.990 --> 00:28:53.838
Look, that's the beauty.
 

00:28:53.838 --> 00:28:58.510
Once you've got the right
answer, everything is going to

00:28:58.510 --> 00:29:00.038
be on your side.
 

00:29:00.038 --> 00:29:02.316
Before I forget,
I should mention to you,

00:29:02.316 --> 00:29:05.446
you've probably heard that
Einstein is very unhappy with

00:29:05.446 --> 00:29:06.700
quantum mechanics.
 

00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:09.417
And yet if you look at the
history, he made enormous

00:29:09.417 --> 00:29:11.390
contributions to quantum
mechanics.

00:29:11.390 --> 00:29:14.992
Even Planck didn't have the
courage to stand behind the

00:29:14.992 --> 00:29:18.130
photons that were implied in his
own formula.

00:29:18.130 --> 00:29:21.598
Einstein took it to be very
real and pursued it.

00:29:21.598 --> 00:29:23.432
So when you say he doesn't like
quantum mechanics,

00:29:23.432 --> 00:29:25.230
it's not that he couldn't do
the problem sets.

00:29:25.230 --> 00:29:28.230
It's that he had problems with
the problems.

00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:31.457
He did not like the
probabilistic nature of quantum

00:29:31.457 --> 00:29:35.460
mechanics, but he had no trouble
divining what was going on.

00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:36.519
So it's quite different.
 

00:29:36.519 --> 00:29:39.002
It's like saying,
"I don't like that

00:29:39.002 --> 00:29:39.809
joke."
 

00:29:39.809 --> 00:29:40.460
There are two reasons.
 

00:29:40.460 --> 00:29:42.920
Some guys don't get it and they
don't like it.

00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:45.130
Some guys get it and don't
think it's funny.

00:29:45.130 --> 00:29:47.631
So this was like Einstein
certainly understood all the

00:29:47.631 --> 00:29:49.328
complexities of quantum
mechanics.

00:29:49.328 --> 00:29:51.220
He said he had spent more time
on quantum,

00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:55.116
much more on either the special
or the general theory of

00:29:55.116 --> 00:29:57.412
relativity,
because he said that was a real

00:29:57.412 --> 00:29:57.788
problem.
 

00:29:57.788 --> 00:30:00.288
That's a problem I couldn't
track.

00:30:00.288 --> 00:30:03.942
Now it turns out that even till
the end, he didn't find an

00:30:03.942 --> 00:30:06.380
answer that was satisfactory to
him.

00:30:06.380 --> 00:30:08.317
The answer I'm giving you
certainly works,

00:30:08.317 --> 00:30:10.920
makes all the predictions,
never said anything wrong.

00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:15.087
Until something better comes to
replace it, we will keep using

00:30:15.087 --> 00:30:15.430
it.
 

00:30:15.430 --> 00:30:18.550
Anyway, going back,
the second experiment that

00:30:18.550 --> 00:30:20.980
confirmed the reality of
photons.

00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:24.063
See, if you say light is made
of particles and each one has an

00:30:24.063 --> 00:30:26.337
energy and momentum,
do you understand why the

00:30:26.337 --> 00:30:28.359
photoelectric effect is a good
test.

00:30:28.359 --> 00:30:30.339
It agrees with that picture.
 

00:30:30.339 --> 00:30:31.808
Individual particles come.
 

00:30:31.808 --> 00:30:34.929
Some have the energy to
liberate the electron and some

00:30:34.929 --> 00:30:35.400
don't.
 

00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:37.509
And if individually,
they cannot do it,

00:30:37.509 --> 00:30:39.618
it doesn't matter how many you
send.

00:30:39.618 --> 00:30:43.107
Now you may have thought of one
scenario in which all of these

00:30:43.107 --> 00:30:46.025
tiny little kids can get
something lifted out of the

00:30:46.025 --> 00:30:46.539
well.
 

00:30:46.539 --> 00:30:51.750
How will they do that?
 

00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:55.246
Maybe 10 kids together,
like ants, can lift the thing

00:30:55.246 --> 00:30:55.650
out.
 

00:30:55.650 --> 00:30:59.334
So if you had 10 photons which
can collectively excite the

00:30:59.334 --> 00:31:01.049
electron,
it can happen,

00:31:01.049 --> 00:31:04.276
but in those days,
they didn't have a light whose

00:31:04.276 --> 00:31:08.038
intensity was enough to send
enough of these photons.

00:31:08.038 --> 00:31:10.193
But nowadays,
it turns out that if you

00:31:10.193 --> 00:31:13.105
really, really crank up the
intensity, you can make

00:31:13.105 --> 00:31:15.960
electrons come out,
even below the frequency.

00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:19.122
That's because more than one
photon is involved in ejecting

00:31:19.122 --> 00:31:19.940
the electron.
 

00:31:19.940 --> 00:31:22.693
So luckily, we didn't have that
intensity then,

00:31:22.693 --> 00:31:25.328
so we go the picture of the
photons right.

00:31:25.328 --> 00:31:29.807
Anyway, Compton said the
following thing - it turns out

00:31:29.807 --> 00:31:34.366
that if you have an electron
here and you send a beam of

00:31:34.366 --> 00:31:37.248
light,
it scatters off the electron

00:31:37.248 --> 00:31:41.465
and comes off in some direction
at an angle q to the original

00:31:41.465 --> 00:31:42.380
direction.
 

00:31:42.380 --> 00:31:48.154
The wavelength here changes by
an amount Dl,

00:31:48.154 --> 00:31:53.351
and Dl happens to be
2pℏ

00:31:53.351 --> 00:31:58.779
/mc x 1 - cosine
q.

00:31:58.779 --> 00:31:59.808
Are you with me?
 

00:31:59.808 --> 00:32:03.240
You send light in at a known
wavelength.

00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:06.076
It scatters off the electron
and comes at an angle q,

00:32:06.076 --> 00:32:09.020
no longer preserving its
wavelength, having a different

00:32:09.020 --> 00:32:09.838
wavelength.
 

00:32:09.838 --> 00:32:13.199
And the shift in the wavelength
is connected to the angle of

00:32:13.199 --> 00:32:13.940
scattering.
 

00:32:13.940 --> 00:32:16.335
For example,
if q is 0, Dl is 0 in the

00:32:16.335 --> 00:32:17.630
forward direction.
 

00:32:17.630 --> 00:32:20.680
If it bounces right back,
that cos q is -1.

00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:23.980
That number is 2 and you get a
huge Dl.

00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:29.210
And you can find the l of it by
putting a diffraction grating.

00:32:29.210 --> 00:32:35.015
Now, what one could show is
that if you took this to be made

00:32:35.015 --> 00:32:37.865
of particles,
and each particle has an

00:32:37.865 --> 00:32:40.788
energy, ℏw,
and each particle has a

00:32:40.788 --> 00:32:44.405
momentum, ℏk,
and that that collides with an

00:32:44.405 --> 00:32:46.906
electron,
then you just balance energy

00:32:46.906 --> 00:32:49.558
conservation and momentum
conservation.

00:32:49.558 --> 00:32:52.148
In any collision,
energy and momentum before =

00:32:52.148 --> 00:32:53.759
energy and momentum after.
 

00:32:53.759 --> 00:32:55.790
You set them equal and you
fiddle around,

00:32:55.790 --> 00:32:58.279
you can find the new momentum
after scattering.

00:32:58.279 --> 00:33:00.547
From the new momentum,
you can extract the new

00:33:00.547 --> 00:33:03.519
wavelength and you will find
this formula actually works.

00:33:03.519 --> 00:33:07.404
So I did that in Physics 200,
I think, so if you want,

00:33:07.404 --> 00:33:11.509
you can go look at that,
or maybe it was done for you.

00:33:11.509 --> 00:33:12.000
I don't know.
 

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:15.538
But Compton's scattering,
the scattering due to Compton,

00:33:15.538 --> 00:33:19.310
can be completely understood if
you think of the incoming beam

00:33:19.310 --> 00:33:22.959
of light as made up of particles
with that momentum and that

00:33:22.959 --> 00:33:23.640
energy.
 

00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:26.307
In other words,
you're always going to go back

00:33:26.307 --> 00:33:27.019
and forth.
 

00:33:27.019 --> 00:33:30.578
Light will be characterized by
a wavelength and by a momentum.

00:33:30.578 --> 00:33:34.368
It will be characterized by a
frequency and by an energy.

00:33:34.368 --> 00:33:36.635
When you think about the
particles, you'll think of the

00:33:36.635 --> 00:33:37.558
energy and momentum.
 

00:33:37.558 --> 00:33:41.840
When you think about the waves,
you'll think of frequency and

00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:42.838
wave number.
 

00:33:42.838 --> 00:33:45.190
So this is what really nailed
it.

00:33:45.190 --> 00:33:51.000
After this, you could not doubt
the reality of the photons.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:55.829
Okay, now I go back to my old
story.

00:33:55.829 --> 00:33:57.420
Let's remember what it is.
 

00:33:57.420 --> 00:34:00.891
The shock is that light,
which we were willing to

00:34:00.891 --> 00:34:03.528
believe was waves,
because Young had done the

00:34:03.528 --> 00:34:06.576
interference experiment,
is actually made up of

00:34:06.576 --> 00:34:07.539
particles.
 

00:34:07.539 --> 00:34:08.840
That's the first thing.
 

00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:10.550
So who needs the wave?
 

00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:13.003
If you send a single photon
into a double slit,

00:34:13.003 --> 00:34:14.710
we don't know what it will do.
 

00:34:14.710 --> 00:34:17.050
We can only give the odds.
 

00:34:17.050 --> 00:34:20.233
To find the odds,
we take the photon's wavelength

00:34:20.233 --> 00:34:23.021
and we form this wave,
and then we form the

00:34:23.021 --> 00:34:24.679
interference pattern.
 

00:34:24.679 --> 00:34:28.393
And we find out that whenever
it is high, it is very likely to

00:34:28.393 --> 00:34:28.820
come.
 

00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:31.085
Wherever it's low,
it's very unlikely,

00:34:31.085 --> 00:34:32.679
but at 0, it won't come.
 

00:34:32.679 --> 00:34:35.181
So to test this theory,
it's not enough to send 1

00:34:35.181 --> 00:34:35.650
photon.
 

00:34:35.650 --> 00:34:39.260
1 photon may come here;
that doesn't show you anything.

00:34:39.260 --> 00:34:42.293
You've got to send millions of
photons, because if a prediction

00:34:42.293 --> 00:34:44.494
is probabilistic,
to test it, you've got to do

00:34:44.494 --> 00:34:45.230
many times.
 

00:34:45.230 --> 00:34:47.768
If I give you a coin,
and I tell you it's a fair

00:34:47.768 --> 00:34:50.739
coin, I toss it a couple of
times and I get 1 head and 1

00:34:50.739 --> 00:34:52.630
tail, it doesn't mean anything.
 

00:34:52.630 --> 00:34:55.219
You want to toss it 500,000
times and see if roughly half

00:34:55.219 --> 00:34:57.579
the time it's heads and half the
time it's tails.

00:34:57.579 --> 00:35:00.119
That's when a probabilistic
theory is verified.

00:35:00.119 --> 00:35:02.980
It's not verified by
individuals.

00:35:02.980 --> 00:35:06.436
Insurance companies are always
drawing pictures of when I'm

00:35:06.436 --> 00:35:07.329
going to die.
 

00:35:07.329 --> 00:35:12.090
They've got some plot,
and that's my average chance.

00:35:12.090 --> 00:35:15.123
I don't know when I will be
part of that statistic,

00:35:15.123 --> 00:35:18.340
because in fact--sorry,
it usually looks like this.

00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:22.007
Life expectancy of people looks
like that, but doesn't mean

00:35:22.007 --> 00:35:23.780
everybody dies at one day.
 

00:35:23.780 --> 00:35:27.367
People are dying left and
right, so there's probability on

00:35:27.367 --> 00:35:28.250
either side.
 

00:35:28.250 --> 00:35:31.440
So to verify this table that
companies have got,

00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:34.018
you have to watch a huge
population.

00:35:34.018 --> 00:35:36.760
Then you can do the histogram
and then you get the profile.

00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:40.474
So whenever you do statistical
theories, you've got to run it

00:35:40.474 --> 00:35:41.280
many times.
 

00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:43.349
I'll tell you more about
statistics and quantum

00:35:43.349 --> 00:35:43.889
mechanics.
 

00:35:43.889 --> 00:35:46.529
It's different from statistics
and classical mechanics and

00:35:46.529 --> 00:35:47.780
we'll come to that later.
 

00:35:47.780 --> 00:35:50.197
But for now,
you must understand the

00:35:50.197 --> 00:35:52.340
peculiar behavior of photons.
 

00:35:52.340 --> 00:35:55.126
They are not particles
entirely, they are not waves

00:35:55.126 --> 00:35:55.739
entirely.
 

00:35:55.739 --> 00:35:59.099
They are particles in the sense
they're localized energy and

00:35:59.099 --> 00:36:02.460
momentum, but they don't travel
like Newtonian particles.

00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:04.755
If they were Newtonian
particles, you'll never

00:36:04.755 --> 00:36:07.967
understand why opening a second
slit reduced the amount of light

00:36:07.967 --> 00:36:09.039
coming somewhere.
 

00:36:09.039 --> 00:36:10.900
All right, so this is the story.
 

00:36:10.900 --> 00:36:15.159
So now comes the French
physicist,

00:36:15.159 --> 00:36:19.592
de Broglie, and he argued as
follows - you'll find his

00:36:19.592 --> 00:36:24.353
argument quite persuasive,
and this is what he did for his

00:36:24.353 --> 00:36:24.730
PhD.
 

00:36:24.730 --> 00:36:29.585
He said, "If light,
which I thought was a

00:36:29.585 --> 00:36:32.333
particle--
I'm sorry, which I thought was

00:36:32.333 --> 00:36:34.056
a wave,
is actually made up of

00:36:34.056 --> 00:36:37.159
particles, perhaps things which
I always thought of as

00:36:37.159 --> 00:36:39.282
particles,
like electrons,

00:36:39.282 --> 00:36:42.760
have a wave associated with
them."

00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:45.309
And he said,
"Let me postulate that

00:36:45.309 --> 00:36:48.904
electrons also have a wave
associated with them and that

00:36:48.904 --> 00:36:52.956
the wavelength associated with
an electron of momentum p

00:36:52.956 --> 00:36:56.289
will be 2pℏ
/p;

00:36:56.289 --> 00:37:01.159
and that this wave will produce
the same interference pattern

00:37:01.159 --> 00:37:06.110
when you do it with electrons,
as you did with light."

00:37:06.110 --> 00:37:07.500
So what does that mean?
 

00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:11.239
It means if you did a double
slit experiment,

00:37:11.239 --> 00:37:13.809
and you sent electrons of
momentum p,

00:37:13.809 --> 00:37:16.070
one at a time,
and you sit here with an

00:37:16.070 --> 00:37:20.085
electron detector,
or you have an array of

00:37:20.085 --> 00:37:25.418
electron detectors,
he claims that the pattern will

00:37:25.418 --> 00:37:29.373
look like this,
where this pattern is obtained

00:37:29.373 --> 00:37:34.282
by using a certain wavelength
that corresponds to the momentum

00:37:34.282 --> 00:37:37.260
of the incoming beam of
electrons.

00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:40.516
Now there the shock is not that
the electron hits one point on

00:37:40.516 --> 00:37:41.210
the screen.
 

00:37:41.210 --> 00:37:43.389
It supposed to;
it's a particle.

00:37:43.389 --> 00:37:46.268
What is shocking is that when
two slits are open,

00:37:46.268 --> 00:37:49.869
you don't get any electrons in
the location where you used to

00:37:49.869 --> 00:37:50.949
get electrons.
 

00:37:50.949 --> 00:37:54.226
That is the surprising thing,
because if an electron is a

00:37:54.226 --> 00:37:58.090
Newtonian particle and you used
to go like that through hole 1,

00:37:58.090 --> 00:38:00.389
and you used to go like that
through hole 2,

00:38:00.389 --> 00:38:02.150
if you open the two holes and
two slits,

00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:06.289
you've got to get the sum of
the two numbers.

00:38:06.289 --> 00:38:10.170
You cannot escape that,
because in Newtonian mechanics,

00:38:10.170 --> 00:38:14.409
an electron either goes through
slit 1 or through slit 2.

00:38:14.409 --> 00:38:16.320
And therefore,
the number coming here is

00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:19.259
simply the sum of the ones that
went here, the ones that went

00:38:19.259 --> 00:38:19.699
here.
 

00:38:19.699 --> 00:38:22.219
Now sometimes people think,
"Well,

00:38:22.219 --> 00:38:24.768
if you have a lot of electrons
coming here,

00:38:24.768 --> 00:38:28.443
maybe these guys bumped into
these guys and collided and

00:38:28.443 --> 00:38:32.050
therefore didn't hit the screen
at that point."

00:38:32.050 --> 00:38:33.369
That's a fake.
 

00:38:33.369 --> 00:38:35.409
You know you don't have much of
a chance with that explanation,

00:38:35.409 --> 00:38:37.110
because if there are random
collisions,

00:38:37.110 --> 00:38:39.010
what are the odds they'll form
this beautiful,

00:38:39.010 --> 00:38:40.539
repeatable pattern?
 

00:38:40.539 --> 00:38:42.199
Not very big.
 

00:38:42.199 --> 00:38:44.719
Furthermore,
you can silence that criticism

00:38:44.719 --> 00:38:48.380
by making the electron gun that
emits electrons so feeble that

00:38:48.380 --> 00:38:51.309
at a given time,
there's only one electron.

00:38:51.309 --> 00:38:53.340
There's only one electron in
the lab.

00:38:53.340 --> 00:38:55.710
It left here,
then it arrived there.

00:38:55.710 --> 00:38:57.809
And it cannot collide with
itself.

00:38:57.809 --> 00:39:02.599
And yet it knows two slits are
open.

00:39:02.599 --> 00:39:07.150
A Newtonian particle cannot
know that two slits are open.

00:39:07.150 --> 00:39:11.733
So it has an associated wave,
and if you do this calculation

00:39:11.733 --> 00:39:16.315
and you find the interference
pattern, that's what electrons

00:39:16.315 --> 00:39:16.860
do.
 

00:39:16.860 --> 00:39:18.980
Originally, it was not done
with a double slit.

00:39:18.980 --> 00:39:20.210
It was done with a crystal.
 

00:39:20.210 --> 00:39:23.858
I have given you one homework
problem where you can see how a

00:39:23.858 --> 00:39:27.324
crystal of atoms regularly
arranged can also help you find

00:39:27.324 --> 00:39:29.210
the wavelength of anything.
 

00:39:29.210 --> 00:39:31.940
And you shine a beam of
electrons on a crystal,

00:39:31.940 --> 00:39:35.280
you find out that they come out
in only one particular angle,

00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:37.059
and using the angle,
you can find the wavelength,

00:39:37.059 --> 00:39:39.559
and the wavelength agrees with
the momentum.

00:39:39.559 --> 00:39:40.800
The momentum of the electron is
known,

00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:44.492
because if you accelerate them
between two plates with a

00:39:44.492 --> 00:39:47.420
certain voltage,
V, and the electron

00:39:47.420 --> 00:39:50.878
drops down the voltage,
it gains an energy eV,

00:39:50.878 --> 00:39:53.070
which is ½
mv^(2),

00:39:53.070 --> 00:39:56.030
which you can also write as
p^(2)/2m.

00:39:56.030 --> 00:40:00.992
So you can find the momentum of
an electron before you send it

00:40:00.992 --> 00:40:01.400
in.
 

00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:07.730
Okay, so this is the
peculiarity of particles now.

00:40:07.730 --> 00:40:13.289
Electron also behaves like a
particle or a wave.

00:40:13.289 --> 00:40:19.389
So now you can ask yourself the
following question.

00:40:19.389 --> 00:40:22.360
Why is it that microscopic
bodies--first of all,

00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:25.329
I hope you understand how
surprising this is.

00:40:25.329 --> 00:40:26.590
Suppose it was not electrons.
 

00:40:26.590 --> 00:40:29.481
Suppose this was not an
electron gun,

00:40:29.481 --> 00:40:31.570
but a machine gun,
okay?

00:40:31.570 --> 00:40:34.179
And these are some concrete
barriers.

00:40:34.179 --> 00:40:38.480
The barrier has a hole in it
and that's you.

00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:42.378
They've tied you to the back
wall and they're firing bullets

00:40:42.378 --> 00:40:44.438
at you,
and you're of course very

00:40:44.438 --> 00:40:47.460
anxious when a friend of yours
comes along and says,

00:40:47.460 --> 00:40:49.389
"I want to help you."
 

00:40:49.389 --> 00:40:54.699
So let me do that.
 

00:40:54.699 --> 00:40:57.753
So you know that that's not a
friend, and if you do it with

00:40:57.753 --> 00:40:59.070
bullets, it won't help.
 

00:40:59.070 --> 00:41:00.320
You cannot reduce the number of
bullets.

00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:03.036
And why is it with
electrons--if instead of the big

00:41:03.036 --> 00:41:05.134
scenario,
we scale the whole thing down

00:41:05.134 --> 00:41:07.494
to atomic dimensions,
and you're talking about

00:41:07.494 --> 00:41:10.280
electrons and slits which are a
few micrometers away,

00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:13.590
why is it that with electrons,
you can do that?

00:41:13.590 --> 00:41:16.250
Why is it with bullets you
don't do that?

00:41:16.250 --> 00:41:21.940
The answer has to do with this
wavelength p.

00:41:21.940 --> 00:41:26.202
If you put for p,
m x v and you put

00:41:26.202 --> 00:41:30.309
for m the mass of a
cannonball or a bullet,

00:41:30.309 --> 00:41:35.168
say 1 kilogram,
you will find this wavelength

00:41:35.168 --> 00:41:37.820
is 10^(-27 )something.
 

00:41:37.820 --> 00:41:43.054
That means these oscillations
will have maybe 10^(20

00:41:43.054 --> 00:41:49.010
)oscillations per centimeter and
you cannot detect that.

00:41:49.010 --> 00:41:51.474
So oscillation,
the human eye cannot detect

00:41:51.474 --> 00:41:54.878
that, and everything else looks
like you're just adding the

00:41:54.878 --> 00:41:57.579
intensities, not adding the wave
function.

00:41:57.579 --> 00:42:00.985
It looks like the probabilities
are additive,

00:42:00.985 --> 00:42:04.469
and you don't see the
interference pattern.

00:42:04.469 --> 00:42:07.963
Now there's another very
interesting twist on this

00:42:07.963 --> 00:42:10.389
experiment, which is as follows.
 

00:42:10.389 --> 00:42:12.885
You go back to that experiment,
and you say,

00:42:12.885 --> 00:42:16.425
"Look, I do not buy this
notion that an electron does not

00:42:16.425 --> 00:42:17.820
go through one slit.
 

00:42:17.820 --> 00:42:18.750
I mean, come on.
 

00:42:18.750 --> 00:42:22.000
How can it not go through one
particular slit?"

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:23.800
So here's what I'm going to do.
 

00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:28.610
I'm going to put a light bulb
here.

00:42:28.610 --> 00:42:31.409
I'm going to have the light
bulb look at the slit,

00:42:31.409 --> 00:42:35.315
and when this guy goes past,
I will see whether the guy went

00:42:35.315 --> 00:42:38.030
through this slit or through
that slit.

00:42:38.030 --> 00:42:40.289
Then there's no talk about
going through both slits or not

00:42:40.289 --> 00:42:42.710
going through a definite slit or
not having the trajectory.

00:42:42.710 --> 00:42:45.179
All that's wrong,
because I'm going to actually

00:42:45.179 --> 00:42:48.509
catch the electron in the act of
going through one or the other

00:42:48.509 --> 00:42:50.119
by putting a light source.
 

00:42:50.119 --> 00:42:52.217
So you put a light source,
and whenever it hits an

00:42:52.217 --> 00:42:54.869
electron, you will see a flash
and you will know whether it was

00:42:54.869 --> 00:42:56.239
near this hole or that hole.
 

00:42:56.239 --> 00:42:58.480
You make a tally.
 

00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:01.434
So you find that a certain
number went through hole 1,

00:43:01.434 --> 00:43:03.610
a certain number went through
hole 2.

00:43:03.610 --> 00:43:05.590
You add them up,
you get the number,

00:43:05.590 --> 00:43:07.739
you cannot avoid getting the
number.

00:43:07.739 --> 00:43:12.768
Let's imagine that of our 1,000
electrons, about 20 got by

00:43:12.768 --> 00:43:15.150
without your seeing them.
 

00:43:15.150 --> 00:43:15.860
It can happen.
 

00:43:15.860 --> 00:43:17.489
When you turn the light,
you don't see it;

00:43:17.489 --> 00:43:19.820
it misses.
 

00:43:19.820 --> 00:43:24.400
Then you will find a pattern
that looks like this.

00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:29.902
There'll be a 2 percent wiggle
on top of this featureless

00:43:29.902 --> 00:43:30.690
curve.
 

00:43:30.690 --> 00:43:33.219
In other words,
the electrons that you caught

00:43:33.219 --> 00:43:36.210
and identified as going through
slit 1 or slit 2,

00:43:36.210 --> 00:43:39.829
their numbers add up the way
they do in Newtonian mechanics,

00:43:39.829 --> 00:43:42.119
but the electrons you did not
catch,

00:43:42.119 --> 00:43:45.045
who slipped by,
pretend as if they went through

00:43:45.045 --> 00:43:48.525
both the slits,
or at least they showed the

00:43:48.525 --> 00:43:50.429
interference pattern.
 

00:43:50.429 --> 00:43:53.063
That's a very novel thing,
that whether you see the

00:43:53.063 --> 00:43:55.329
electron or not,
makes such a difference.

00:43:55.329 --> 00:43:56.429
That's all I did.
 

00:43:56.429 --> 00:43:58.760
In one case,
I caught the electron.

00:43:58.760 --> 00:44:00.119
In the other case, I slipped by.
 

00:44:00.119 --> 00:44:04.755
And whenever it's not observed,
it seems to be able to somehow

00:44:04.755 --> 00:44:06.579
be aware of two slits.
 

00:44:06.579 --> 00:44:09.990
And this was a big surprise,
because normally when we study

00:44:09.990 --> 00:44:13.751
anything in Newtonian mechanics,
you say here's a collision,

00:44:13.751 --> 00:44:17.159
ball 1 collides and goes there,
you do all the calculations.

00:44:17.159 --> 00:44:19.510
Meanwhile, we are watching it.
 

00:44:19.510 --> 00:44:20.920
Maybe we are not watching it.
 

00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:21.800
Who cares?
 

00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:24.260
The answer doesn't depend on
whether we are watching or not?

00:44:24.260 --> 00:44:25.800
For example,
if you have a football game,

00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:28.030
and somebody throws the pass,
and you close your eyes,

00:44:28.030 --> 00:44:30.253
which sometimes my kids do,
because they don't know what's

00:44:30.253 --> 00:44:32.601
happening,
that doesn't change the outcome

00:44:32.601 --> 00:44:33.730
of the experiment.
 

00:44:33.730 --> 00:44:36.000
It follows its own trajectory.
 

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:38.940
So what does seeing do to
anything?

00:44:38.940 --> 00:44:42.327
And you can say maybe he didn't
see it, but maybe people in the

00:44:42.327 --> 00:44:44.460
stadium were looking at the
football.

00:44:44.460 --> 00:44:46.820
So turn off all the lights.
 

00:44:46.820 --> 00:44:49.594
Then does the football have a
definite trajectory from start

00:44:49.594 --> 00:44:50.159
to finish?
 

00:44:50.159 --> 00:44:54.719
It does, because it's colliding
with all these air molecules.

00:44:54.719 --> 00:44:56.731
To remove all the air
molecules, of course,

00:44:56.731 --> 00:44:59.365
first you remove all the
spectators, then you remove all

00:44:59.365 --> 00:45:00.420
the air molecules.
 

00:45:00.420 --> 00:45:02.000
Then does it have a definite
trajectory?

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:03.429
You might say,
"Of course it does.

00:45:03.429 --> 00:45:04.949
What difference does it
make?"

00:45:04.949 --> 00:45:07.230
But then you would be wrong.
 

00:45:07.230 --> 00:45:09.449
You would be wrong to think it
had a trajectory,

00:45:09.449 --> 00:45:11.900
because the minute you said it
had a trajectory,

00:45:11.900 --> 00:45:14.039
you will never understand
interference,

00:45:14.039 --> 00:45:16.590
which even a football can show.
 

00:45:16.590 --> 00:45:19.099
But the condition is,
for a football to show this

00:45:19.099 --> 00:45:21.869
kind of quantum effects,
it should not be disturbed by

00:45:21.869 --> 00:45:22.550
anything.
 

00:45:22.550 --> 00:45:24.849
It should not be seen.
 

00:45:24.849 --> 00:45:27.139
Nothing can collide with it.
 

00:45:27.139 --> 00:45:30.155
The minute you interact with a
quantum system,

00:45:30.155 --> 00:45:33.974
it stops doing this wishy-washy
business of "Where am

00:45:33.974 --> 00:45:34.780
I?"
 

00:45:34.780 --> 00:45:36.650
Till you see it,
it's not anywhere.

00:45:36.650 --> 00:45:38.849
Once you see it,
it's in a different location.

00:45:38.849 --> 00:45:41.079
Till you see it,
it's not taking any particular

00:45:41.079 --> 00:45:41.420
path.
 

00:45:41.420 --> 00:45:44.550
To assume it took this or that
path is simply wrong.

00:45:44.550 --> 00:45:47.840
But the act of observation
nails it.

00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:50.119
So why is observation so
important?

00:45:50.119 --> 00:45:52.050
You have to ask how we observe
things.

00:45:52.050 --> 00:45:53.900
We shine light.
 

00:45:53.900 --> 00:45:56.617
You've already seen,
the light is made of quanta,

00:45:56.617 --> 00:45:59.675
and each quantum carries a
certain momentum and certain

00:45:59.675 --> 00:46:00.300
energy.
 

00:46:00.300 --> 00:46:05.000
If I want to locate the
electron with some waves,

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:07.641
with some light,
I want the momentum of the

00:46:07.641 --> 00:46:10.193
light to be weak,
because I don't want to slam

00:46:10.193 --> 00:46:12.409
the electron too hard in the act
of finding it.

00:46:12.409 --> 00:46:14.429
So I want p to be very
small.

00:46:14.429 --> 00:46:17.768
If p is very small,
l,

00:46:17.768 --> 00:46:20.340
which is 2pℏ
/p becomes large,

00:46:20.340 --> 00:46:23.780
and once l's bigger than
the spacing between the slits,

00:46:23.780 --> 00:46:25.869
the picture you get will be so
fuzzy,

00:46:25.869 --> 00:46:28.619
you cannot tell which slit it
went through.

00:46:28.619 --> 00:46:31.152
In other words,
to make a fine observation in

00:46:31.152 --> 00:46:34.320
optics, you need a wavelength
smaller than the distances

00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:35.989
you're trying to resolve.
 

00:46:35.989 --> 00:46:38.710
So you've got to use a
wavelength smaller than these

00:46:38.710 --> 00:46:39.349
two slits.
 

00:46:39.349 --> 00:46:44.204
So this p should be such
that this l is comparable

00:46:44.204 --> 00:46:46.670
to this slit,
or even smaller.

00:46:46.670 --> 00:46:50.650
But then you will find the act
of observing the electron

00:46:50.650 --> 00:46:53.980
imparts to it an unknown amount
of momentum.

00:46:53.980 --> 00:46:58.476
Once you change the momentum,
you change the interference

00:46:58.476 --> 00:46:59.280
pattern.
 

00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:03.639
So the act of observation,
which is pretty innocuous for

00:47:03.639 --> 00:47:06.942
you and me--
right now, I'm getting slammed

00:47:06.942 --> 00:47:11.300
by millions of photons,
but I'm taking it like a man.

00:47:11.300 --> 00:47:13.610
But for the electron,
it is not that simple.

00:47:13.610 --> 00:47:16.760
One collision with a photon is
like getting hit by a truck.

00:47:16.760 --> 00:47:19.827
The momentum of the photon is
enormous in the scale of the

00:47:19.827 --> 00:47:20.420
electron.
 

00:47:20.420 --> 00:47:22.550
So it matters a lot to the
electron.

00:47:22.550 --> 00:47:24.199
For example,
when I observe you,

00:47:24.199 --> 00:47:26.860
I see you because photons
bounce back and forth.

00:47:26.860 --> 00:47:29.925
Suppose it's a dark room and I
was swinging one of those things

00:47:29.925 --> 00:47:31.409
you see in Gladiator.
 

00:47:31.409 --> 00:47:32.630
What's that thing called?
 

00:47:32.630 --> 00:47:33.909
Trying to locate you.
 

00:47:33.909 --> 00:47:36.663
So the act of location,
you realize it will be

00:47:36.663 --> 00:47:39.355
memorable for you,
because it's a destructive

00:47:39.355 --> 00:47:40.090
process.
 

00:47:40.090 --> 00:47:43.628
But in Newtonian mechanics,
we can imagine finding gentler

00:47:43.628 --> 00:47:47.228
ways to observe somebody and
there's no limit to how gentle

00:47:47.228 --> 00:47:47.849
it is.
 

00:47:47.849 --> 00:47:51.092
You just say make the light
dimmer and dimmer and dimmer

00:47:51.092 --> 00:47:52.920
till the person doesn't care.
 

00:47:52.920 --> 00:47:56.489
But in quantum theory,
it's not how dim the light is.

00:47:56.489 --> 00:47:59.197
If the light is too dim,
there are too few photons and

00:47:59.197 --> 00:48:00.730
nobody catches the electron.
 

00:48:00.730 --> 00:48:03.480
In order to see the electron,
you've got to send enough

00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:03.989
photons.
 

00:48:03.989 --> 00:48:07.161
But the point is,
each one carries a punch which

00:48:07.161 --> 00:48:08.039
is minimum.
 

00:48:08.039 --> 00:48:10.965
It cannot be smaller than this
number, because if the

00:48:10.965 --> 00:48:14.342
wavelength is bigger than this,
you cannot tell which hole it

00:48:14.342 --> 00:48:15.300
went through.
 

00:48:15.300 --> 00:48:18.996
That's why in quantum theory,
the act of observation is very

00:48:18.996 --> 00:48:21.690
important, and it can change the
outcome.

00:48:21.690 --> 00:48:28.309
Okay, so what can we figure out
from this.

00:48:28.309 --> 00:48:32.474
Well, it looks like the act of
observing somehow affects the

00:48:32.474 --> 00:48:34.380
momentum of the electron.
 

00:48:34.380 --> 00:48:37.380
So people often say that's why,
when you try to measure the

00:48:37.380 --> 00:48:40.068
position of the electron,
you do something bad to the

00:48:40.068 --> 00:48:41.570
momentum of the electron.
 

00:48:41.570 --> 00:48:44.255
We change it,
because you need a large

00:48:44.255 --> 00:48:46.940
momentum to see it very
accurately.

00:48:46.940 --> 00:48:51.279
But that statement is partly
correct but partly incomplete

00:48:51.279 --> 00:48:53.639
and I'll tell you what it is.
 

00:48:53.639 --> 00:48:56.715
The trouble is not that you use
a high momentum photon to see an

00:48:56.715 --> 00:48:57.739
electron precisely.
 

00:48:57.739 --> 00:49:00.059
That's not a problem.
 

00:49:00.059 --> 00:49:02.664
The problem is that when it
bounces off the electron and

00:49:02.664 --> 00:49:04.893
comes back to you,
it would have changed,

00:49:04.893 --> 00:49:07.809
the momentum by an amount that
you cannot predict,

00:49:07.809 --> 00:49:10.239
and I'll tell you why that is
the case.

00:49:10.239 --> 00:49:14.516
So I told you long back that if
you have a hole and light comes

00:49:14.516 --> 00:49:18.032
in through it,
it doesn't go straight,

00:49:18.032 --> 00:49:21.637
it fans out,
that the profile of light looks

00:49:21.637 --> 00:49:22.409
like this.
 

00:49:22.409 --> 00:49:28.679
It spreads out and the angle by
which it spreads out obeys the

00:49:28.679 --> 00:49:32.380
condition dsinq =
l.

00:49:32.380 --> 00:49:35.360
Remember that part from wave
theory of light.

00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:39.114
Now here is the person trying
to catch an electron,

00:49:39.114 --> 00:49:41.969
which is somewhere around this
line.

00:49:41.969 --> 00:49:47.280
And he or she brings a
microscope that looks like this.

00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:51.617
Here's the opening of the
microscope, and you send some

00:49:51.617 --> 00:49:52.260
light.
 

00:49:52.260 --> 00:49:58.559
This opening of the microscope
has some extent d.

00:49:58.559 --> 00:50:05.610
Let's say it's got a sharp
opening here of width d.

00:50:05.610 --> 00:50:08.612
The light comes,
hits an electron,

00:50:08.612 --> 00:50:12.344
if it is there,
and goes right back to the

00:50:12.344 --> 00:50:13.710
microscope.
 

00:50:13.710 --> 00:50:16.519
If I see a flicker of reflected
light, I know the electron had

00:50:16.519 --> 00:50:18.456
to be somewhere here,
because if it's here,

00:50:18.456 --> 00:50:20.530
it's not going to collide with
the light.

00:50:20.530 --> 00:50:23.666
So you agree,
this is a way to locate the

00:50:23.666 --> 00:50:28.061
electron's position with an
uncertainty, which is roughly

00:50:28.061 --> 00:50:29.630
d, right?
 

00:50:29.630 --> 00:50:33.141
The electron had to be in front
of the opening of the microscope

00:50:33.141 --> 00:50:35.150
for me to actually see that
flash.

00:50:35.150 --> 00:50:37.943
So I make an electron
microscope with a very tiny

00:50:37.943 --> 00:50:39.688
hole,
and I'm scanning back and

00:50:39.688 --> 00:50:42.809
forth, hoping one day I will hit
an electron and one day I hit

00:50:42.809 --> 00:50:45.659
the electron,
it sends the light right back.

00:50:45.659 --> 00:50:47.510
This has momentum p.
 

00:50:47.510 --> 00:50:49.853
It also sends back with
momentum p,

00:50:49.853 --> 00:50:51.340
but there's one problem.
 

00:50:51.340 --> 00:50:58.980
You know that light entering an
aperture will spread out.

00:50:58.980 --> 00:50:59.789
It won't go straight through.
 

00:50:59.789 --> 00:51:00.909
This is this process.
 

00:51:00.909 --> 00:51:04.179
So if you think of this light
entering your microscope,

00:51:04.179 --> 00:51:05.210
it spreads out.
 

00:51:05.210 --> 00:51:09.329
If it spreads out,
it means the photon that

00:51:09.329 --> 00:51:14.920
bounced back can have a momentum
anywhere in this cone.

00:51:14.920 --> 00:51:17.050
And we don't know where it is.
 

00:51:17.050 --> 00:51:19.429
All we know is it re-entered
the microscope,

00:51:19.429 --> 00:51:21.673
entered this cone,
but anywhere in this cone is

00:51:21.673 --> 00:51:23.961
possible,
because there's a sizeable

00:51:23.961 --> 00:51:27.565
chance the light will come
anywhere into this diffracted

00:51:27.565 --> 00:51:28.219
region.
 

00:51:28.219 --> 00:51:31.778
That means the final photon's
momentum magnitude may be

00:51:31.778 --> 00:51:35.206
p_0,
but its direction is indefinite

00:51:35.206 --> 00:51:36.460
by an amount q.
 

00:51:36.460 --> 00:51:40.539
Therefore the photon's momentum
has a horizontal part,

00:51:40.539 --> 00:51:44.460
p_0sine q,
which is an uncertainty in the

00:51:44.460 --> 00:51:47.969
momentum of the photon in the
x direction.

00:51:47.969 --> 00:51:52.329
This is my x direction.
 

00:51:52.329 --> 00:51:55.807
So now you can see that
Dpx =

00:51:55.807 --> 00:51:58.210
p_0sine q.
 

00:51:58.210 --> 00:52:03.719
Sine q is l over the
width of the slit.

00:52:03.719 --> 00:52:07.018
And l was
2pℏ

00:52:07.018 --> 00:52:11.480
/p_0
over d.

00:52:11.480 --> 00:52:16.715
You can see that these
p_0's cancel,

00:52:16.715 --> 00:52:20.237
then you get d x
Dpx =

00:52:20.237 --> 00:52:23.360
2pℏ.
 

00:52:23.360 --> 00:52:26.773
By the way, another good news
is I'm going to give you very

00:52:26.773 --> 00:52:29.010
detailed notes on quantum
mechanics.

00:52:29.010 --> 00:52:31.599
I'm not following the textbook,
and I know you have to choose

00:52:31.599 --> 00:52:33.929
between listening to me and
writing down everything.

00:52:33.929 --> 00:52:36.621
So everything I'm saying here,
you will find in those notes,

00:52:36.621 --> 00:52:38.719
so don't worry if you didn't
get everything.

00:52:38.719 --> 00:52:41.039
You will have a second chance
to look at it.

00:52:41.039 --> 00:52:43.862
But what you find here is that
d x Dpx is

00:52:43.862 --> 00:52:46.797
2pℏ,
but d is the uncertainty

00:52:46.797 --> 00:52:49.704
in the location of the electron,
so you get Dx,

00:52:49.704 --> 00:52:52.179
Dpx, I'm not going to
say =,

00:52:52.179 --> 00:52:56.590
roughly of order,
ℏ.

00:52:56.590 --> 00:52:59.018
Forget the 2p's and everything.
 

00:52:59.018 --> 00:53:03.806
This is a very tiny number,
10^(-34), so we don't care if

00:53:03.806 --> 00:53:05.260
there are 2p's.
 

00:53:05.260 --> 00:53:10.733
But what this tells you is that
in the act of locating the

00:53:10.733 --> 00:53:14.190
electron--so let's understand
why.

00:53:14.190 --> 00:53:16.951
It's a constant going back and
forth between waves and

00:53:16.951 --> 00:53:17.889
particles, okay?
 

00:53:17.889 --> 00:53:20.360
That's why this happens.
 

00:53:20.360 --> 00:53:23.972
I want to see an electron and I
want to know exactly where I saw

00:53:23.972 --> 00:53:24.260
it.
 

00:53:24.260 --> 00:53:26.764
So I take a microscope with a
very small opening,

00:53:26.764 --> 00:53:29.632
so that if I see that guy,
I know it has to be somewhere

00:53:29.632 --> 00:53:30.989
in front of that hole.
 

00:53:30.989 --> 00:53:34.719
But the photon that came down
and bounced off it,

00:53:34.719 --> 00:53:38.157
if you now use wave theory,
the wave will spread out when

00:53:38.157 --> 00:53:40.860
it re-enters the cone by minimal
angle q,

00:53:40.860 --> 00:53:43.469
given by dsine q =
l.

00:53:43.469 --> 00:53:47.137
That means the photon will also
come at a range of angles,

00:53:47.137 --> 00:53:50.032
spread out, but if it comes at
a tilted angle,

00:53:50.032 --> 00:53:52.670
it certainly has horizontal
momentum.

00:53:52.670 --> 00:53:55.545
That extra horizontal momentum
should be imparted to the

00:53:55.545 --> 00:53:58.579
particle, because initially,
the momentum of this thing was

00:53:58.579 --> 00:53:59.730
strictly vertical.
 

00:53:59.730 --> 00:54:03.228
So the photon has given a
certain horizontal momentum to

00:54:03.228 --> 00:54:06.789
the electron and you don't know
how much it has given.

00:54:06.789 --> 00:54:10.320
And smaller your opening,
so the better you try to locate

00:54:10.320 --> 00:54:13.086
the electron,
bigger will be the spreading

00:54:13.086 --> 00:54:16.539
out, and bigger will be the
uncertainty in the reflected

00:54:16.539 --> 00:54:20.809
photon and therefore uncertainty
in the electron after collision.

00:54:20.809 --> 00:54:23.518
So before the collision,
you could have had an electron

00:54:23.518 --> 00:54:25.976
with perfectly well known
momentum in the x

00:54:25.976 --> 00:54:26.679
direction.
 

00:54:26.679 --> 00:54:29.090
But after you saw it,
you don't know its x

00:54:29.090 --> 00:54:31.503
momentum very well,
because the photon's x

00:54:31.503 --> 00:54:32.809
momentum is not known.
 

00:54:32.809 --> 00:54:35.277
I want you to appreciate,
it's not the fact that the

00:54:35.277 --> 00:54:37.940
photon came in its large
momentum that's the problem;

00:54:37.940 --> 00:54:41.197
it is that it went back into
the microscope with a slight

00:54:41.197 --> 00:54:44.398
uncertainty in its angle,
that comes from diffraction of

00:54:44.398 --> 00:54:44.980
light.
 

00:54:44.980 --> 00:54:47.056
It's the uncertainty of the
angle that turns into

00:54:47.056 --> 00:54:49.480
uncertainty in the x
component of the momentum.

00:54:49.480 --> 00:54:51.630
So basically,
collision of light with

00:54:51.630 --> 00:54:55.038
electrons leaves the electron
with an extra momentum whose

00:54:55.038 --> 00:54:58.784
value we don't know precisely,
because the act of seeing the

00:54:58.784 --> 00:55:01.867
photon with the microscope
necessarily means it accepts

00:55:01.867 --> 00:55:03.809
photons with a range of angles.
 

00:55:03.809 --> 00:55:11.210
Okay, so now I want to tell you
a little more about the

00:55:11.210 --> 00:55:17.239
uncertainty principle in another
language.

00:55:17.239 --> 00:55:23.219
The language is this - here is
a slit.

00:55:23.219 --> 00:55:26.289
Okay, here's one way to state
the uncertainty principle.

00:55:26.289 --> 00:55:30.646
I challenge you to produce for
me an electron whose location is

00:55:30.646 --> 00:55:34.159
known to arbitrary accuracy and
whose momentum,

00:55:34.159 --> 00:55:36.130
in the same dimension,
same direction,

00:55:36.130 --> 00:55:38.690
is also known to arbitrary
accuracy.

00:55:38.690 --> 00:55:40.420
I dare you to make it.
 

00:55:40.420 --> 00:55:45.018
In Newtonian mechanics,
that's not a big deal.

00:55:45.018 --> 00:55:48.480
So let's say this is the
y direction,

00:55:48.480 --> 00:55:52.710
and you say,
"I'll give you an electron

00:55:52.710 --> 00:55:56.349
with precisely known y
coordinate,

00:55:56.349 --> 00:55:59.518
and no uncertainty in y
momentum by the following trick.

00:55:59.518 --> 00:56:03.699
I'll send a beam of electrons
going in this direction,

00:56:03.699 --> 00:56:05.795
in the x direction,
with some momentum

00:56:05.795 --> 00:56:08.369
p_0 and I put a
hole in the middle.

00:56:08.369 --> 00:56:13.030
The only guys escaping have to
come out like this.

00:56:13.030 --> 00:56:16.929
So right outside,
what do I have?

00:56:16.929 --> 00:56:20.869
I have an electron whose
vertical momentum is exactly 0,

00:56:20.869 --> 00:56:23.804
because the beam had no
vertical momentum,

00:56:23.804 --> 00:56:27.530
whose vertical position = the
width of the slit.

00:56:27.530 --> 00:56:30.219
It's uncertain by the width of
the slit, and I can make the

00:56:30.219 --> 00:56:31.518
width as narrow as I like.
 

00:56:31.518 --> 00:56:33.809
I can make my filter finer and
finer and finer,

00:56:33.809 --> 00:56:36.378
till I'm able to give the
electrons a perfectly well

00:56:36.378 --> 00:56:39.199
defined position and perfectly
well defined momentum,

00:56:39.199 --> 00:56:41.289
namely 0.
 

00:56:41.289 --> 00:56:43.389
That's true in Newtonian
mechanics,

00:56:43.389 --> 00:56:45.440
but it's not true in the
quantum theory,

00:56:45.440 --> 00:56:48.282
because as you know,
this incoming beam of electrons

00:56:48.282 --> 00:56:51.889
is associated with a wave,
the wave is going to fan out

00:56:51.889 --> 00:56:53.239
when it comes out.
 

00:56:53.239 --> 00:56:56.409
And we sort of know how much
it's going to fan out.

00:56:56.409 --> 00:56:59.760
That's why I did that
diffraction for you.

00:56:59.760 --> 00:57:05.447
It fans out by an angle
q, so that dsine

00:57:05.447 --> 00:57:07.929
q = l.
 

00:57:07.929 --> 00:57:12.918
That means light can come
anywhere in this cone to your

00:57:12.918 --> 00:57:13.750
screen.
 

00:57:13.750 --> 00:57:17.204
That means the electrons
leaving could have had a

00:57:17.204 --> 00:57:19.940
momentum in any of these
directions.

00:57:19.940 --> 00:57:22.630
So the initial photon at a
momentum p_0,

00:57:22.630 --> 00:57:25.230
the final one has a momentum of
magnitude p_0,

00:57:25.230 --> 00:57:28.099
but whose direction is
uncertain.

00:57:28.099 --> 00:57:32.577
The uncertainty in the y
momentum, simply

00:57:32.577 --> 00:57:36.199
p_0sine
q.

00:57:36.199 --> 00:57:37.219
You understand?
 

00:57:37.219 --> 00:57:39.190
Take a vector
p_0.

00:57:39.190 --> 00:57:41.606
If that angle is q,
this is

00:57:41.606 --> 00:57:44.230
p_0sine
q.

00:57:44.230 --> 00:57:45.059
And we don't know.
 

00:57:45.059 --> 00:57:47.246
Look, it's not that we know
exactly where it's going to

00:57:47.246 --> 00:57:47.530
land.
 

00:57:47.530 --> 00:57:50.498
It can land anywhere inside
this bell shaped curve,

00:57:50.498 --> 00:57:53.170
so it can have any momentum in
this region.

00:57:53.170 --> 00:57:55.978
So the electrons you produce,
even though the position was

00:57:55.978 --> 00:57:57.900
well known to the width of the
slit,

00:57:57.900 --> 00:58:01.224
right after leaving the slit,
are capable of coming all over

00:58:01.224 --> 00:58:01.619
here.
 

00:58:01.619 --> 00:58:04.938
That means they have momenta
which can point in any of these

00:58:04.938 --> 00:58:06.119
allowed directions.
 

00:58:06.119 --> 00:58:09.000
So let's find the uncertainty
in y momentum as this.

00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:12.476
The uncertainty in y
position is just the width of

00:58:12.476 --> 00:58:13.159
the slit.
 

00:58:13.159 --> 00:58:16.599
So take the product now of D py.
 

00:58:16.599 --> 00:58:18.650
Let me call it Dy.
 

00:58:18.650 --> 00:58:24.338
That happens then to be
p_0sine q times

00:58:24.338 --> 00:58:29.405
d but dsine
q is l and l is

00:58:29.405 --> 00:58:33.440
2pℏ/p
_0.

00:58:33.440 --> 00:58:34.849
Cancel the
p_0,

00:58:34.849 --> 00:58:35.849
you get some number.
 

00:58:35.849 --> 00:58:38.630
Forget the 2p's that look like
ℏ.

00:58:38.630 --> 00:58:47.880
So this is the uncertainty
principle.

00:58:47.880 --> 00:58:51.416
So the origin of the
uncertainty principle is that

00:58:51.416 --> 00:58:55.170
the fate of the electrons is
determined by a wave.

00:58:55.170 --> 00:58:58.829
And when you try to localize
the wave in one direction,

00:58:58.829 --> 00:58:59.780
it fans out.
 

00:58:59.780 --> 00:59:03.231
And when it fans out,
the probability of finding the

00:59:03.231 --> 00:59:06.550
electron is not 0 in the
non-forward direction.

00:59:06.550 --> 00:59:09.391
It's got a good chance of being
in the range of non-forward

00:59:09.391 --> 00:59:10.030
directions.
 

00:59:10.030 --> 00:59:13.670
That means momentum has a good
chance of lying all the way from

00:59:13.670 --> 00:59:14.610
there to here.
 

00:59:14.610 --> 00:59:18.320
That means the y
momentum has an uncertainty.

00:59:18.320 --> 00:59:23.809
And more you make the purchase
smaller to nail its position,

00:59:23.809 --> 00:59:28.739
broader this will be,
keeping the product constant.

00:59:28.739 --> 00:59:31.090
So it's not hard mathematically
to understand.

00:59:31.090 --> 00:59:35.353
What is hard to understand is
the notion that somehow you need

00:59:35.353 --> 00:59:38.079
this wave, but it was forced
upon us.

00:59:38.079 --> 00:59:40.590
The wave is forced upon us,
because there's no way to

00:59:40.590 --> 00:59:42.909
understand interference,
except through waves.

00:59:42.909 --> 00:59:44.934
So when people saw the
interference pattern of the

00:59:44.934 --> 00:59:46.920
electrons, they said there's got
to be a wave.

00:59:46.920 --> 00:59:49.268
They said, "What is the
role of that wave?"

00:59:49.268 --> 00:59:51.829
That's what I want you to
understand.

00:59:51.829 --> 00:59:56.695
With every electron now--so
let's summarize what we have

00:59:56.695 --> 00:59:57.579
learned.
 

00:59:57.579 --> 01:00:00.085
When I say electron,
I mean any other particle you

01:00:00.085 --> 01:00:02.130
like, photon,
neutron, doesn't matter.

01:00:02.130 --> 01:00:03.239
They all do this.
 

01:00:03.239 --> 01:00:06.780
Quantum mechanics applies to
everything.

01:00:06.780 --> 01:00:11.581
Therefore, with every electron,
I'm going to associate a

01:00:11.581 --> 01:00:14.853
function,
Y(x)--or

01:00:14.853 --> 01:00:21.514
Y(x,y,z),
so that if you find its

01:00:21.514 --> 01:00:24.811
absolute value,
that gives--or absolute value

01:00:24.811 --> 01:00:29.534
squared,
that gives the odds of finding

01:00:29.534 --> 01:00:33.880
it at the point x,
y, z.

01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:39.650
Let me say it's proportional.
 

01:00:39.650 --> 01:00:40.809
This function is stuck.
 

01:00:40.809 --> 01:00:42.510
We are stuck with this function.
 

01:00:42.510 --> 01:00:44.679
And what else do we know about
the function?

01:00:44.679 --> 01:00:51.532
We know that if the electron
has momentum p,

01:00:51.532 --> 01:00:58.385
then the function Y has
wavelength l,

01:00:58.385 --> 01:01:05.239
which is 2pℏ
/p.

01:01:05.239 --> 01:01:08.199
This is all we know from
experiment.

01:01:08.199 --> 01:01:12.980
So experiment has forced us to
write this function Y.

01:01:12.980 --> 01:01:14.889
And the theory will make
predictions.

01:01:14.889 --> 01:01:19.987
Later on we'll find out how to
calculate the Y in every

01:01:19.987 --> 01:01:20.989
situation.
 

01:01:20.989 --> 01:01:23.275
But the question is,
what is the kinematics of

01:01:23.275 --> 01:01:25.918
quantum mechanics compared to
kinematics of classical

01:01:25.918 --> 01:01:26.630
mechanics?
 

01:01:26.630 --> 01:01:29.398
In classical mechanics,
a particle has a definite

01:01:29.398 --> 01:01:31.650
position, it has a definite
momentum.

01:01:31.650 --> 01:01:36.960
That describes the state of the
particle now.

01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:39.405
Then you want to predict the
future, so you want to know the

01:01:39.405 --> 01:01:41.190
coordinate and momentum of a
future time.

01:01:41.190 --> 01:01:43.420
How are you going to find that?
 

01:01:43.420 --> 01:01:47.929
Anybody know?
 

01:01:47.929 --> 01:01:54.449
How do you find the future of
x and p?

01:01:54.449 --> 01:01:56.856
In Newtonian mechanics;
I'm not talking about quantum

01:01:56.856 --> 01:01:57.340
mechanics.
 

01:01:57.340 --> 01:02:01.539
Student: 
&gt;

01:02:01.539 --> 01:02:04.320
Prof: Which one?
 

01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:05.710
Just use Newton's laws.
 

01:02:05.710 --> 01:02:07.030
That's what Newton's law does
for you.

01:02:07.030 --> 01:02:09.766
It tells you what the
acceleration is in a given

01:02:09.766 --> 01:02:10.349
context.
 

01:02:10.349 --> 01:02:12.900
Then you find the acceleration
to find the new velocity.

01:02:12.900 --> 01:02:16.032
Find the old velocity to find
the new position a little later

01:02:16.032 --> 01:02:18.590
and keep on doing it,
or you solve an equation.

01:02:18.590 --> 01:02:20.516
So the cycle of Newtonian
mechanics is give me the

01:02:20.516 --> 01:02:22.983
x and p,
and I know what they mean,

01:02:22.983 --> 01:02:26.280
and I'll tell you x and
p later if you tell me

01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:27.739
the forces acting on it.
 

01:02:27.739 --> 01:02:30.922
Or if you want to write the
force as a gradient of a

01:02:30.922 --> 01:02:34.230
potential, you will have to be
given the potential.

01:02:34.230 --> 01:02:36.954
In quantum mechanics,
you are given a function

01:02:36.954 --> 01:02:37.619
Y.
 

01:02:37.619 --> 01:02:41.829
Suppose the particle lives in
only one dimension,

01:02:41.829 --> 01:02:44.840
then for one particle,
not for a swarm of particles,

01:02:44.840 --> 01:02:48.688
for one particle,
for every particle there can be

01:02:48.688 --> 01:02:53.179
a function Y associated
with it at any instant.

01:02:53.179 --> 01:02:55.349
That tells you the full story.
 

01:02:55.349 --> 01:02:59.929
Remember, we've gone from two
numbers, x and p,

01:02:59.929 --> 01:03:01.610
to a whole function.
 

01:03:01.610 --> 01:03:03.929
What does the function do?
 

01:03:03.929 --> 01:03:07.800
If you squared the function at
this point--

01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:10.449
square will look roughly the
same thing--

01:03:10.449 --> 01:03:14.380
that height is proportional to
the odds of finding it here,

01:03:14.380 --> 01:03:17.039
and that means it's a very high
chance of being found here,

01:03:17.039 --> 01:03:22.300
maybe no chance of being found
here and so on.

01:03:22.300 --> 01:03:24.539
That's called the wave function.
 

01:03:24.539 --> 01:03:28.400
The name for this guy is the
wave function.

01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:32.670
So far we know only one wave
function.

01:03:32.670 --> 01:03:36.088
In a double slit experiment,
if you send electrons of

01:03:36.088 --> 01:03:39.173
momentum p,
that wave function seems to

01:03:39.173 --> 01:03:42.646
have a wavelength l
connected to p by this

01:03:42.646 --> 01:03:43.719
formula, this.
 

01:03:43.719 --> 01:03:52.018
This is all we know.
 

01:03:52.018 --> 01:03:59.074
So let's ask the following
question - take a particle of

01:03:59.074 --> 01:04:01.639
momentum p.
 

01:04:01.639 --> 01:04:04.938
What do you think the
corresponding wave function is

01:04:04.938 --> 01:04:07.010
in the double slit experiment?
 

01:04:07.010 --> 01:04:18.650
Can you cook up the function in
the double slit experiment at

01:04:18.650 --> 01:04:21.949
any given time?
 

01:04:21.949 --> 01:04:26.382
So I want to write a function
that can describe the electron

01:04:26.382 --> 01:04:30.967
in that double slit experiment,
and I'll tell you the momentum

01:04:30.967 --> 01:04:32.170
is p.
 

01:04:32.170 --> 01:04:34.719
So what can you tell from wave
theory?

01:04:34.719 --> 01:04:37.514
Let's say the wave is
traveling, this is the x

01:04:37.514 --> 01:04:38.159
direction.
 

01:04:38.159 --> 01:04:42.701
What can you say about
Y(x) at some given

01:04:42.701 --> 01:04:43.289
time?
 

01:04:43.289 --> 01:04:48.510
It's got some amplitude and
it's oscillating,

01:04:48.510 --> 01:04:53.730
so it's cosine
2px/l.

01:04:53.730 --> 01:04:54.949
Forget the time dependence.
 

01:04:54.949 --> 01:04:57.920
At one instant of time,
it's going to look like this.

01:04:57.920 --> 01:05:01.900
This is the wavelength l
for anything.

01:05:01.900 --> 01:05:05.391
But now I know that l is
connected to momentum as follows

01:05:05.391 --> 01:05:08.164
- l is 2pℏ
/p,

01:05:08.164 --> 01:05:09.550
so let's put that in.
 

01:05:09.550 --> 01:05:19.945
So 2p/l
= Acosine p

01:05:19.945 --> 01:05:24.449
over ℏx.
 

01:05:24.449 --> 01:05:27.210
This has the right wavelength
for the given momentum.

01:05:27.210 --> 01:05:29.672
In other words,
if you send electrons of

01:05:29.672 --> 01:05:32.690
momentum p,
and you put that p into this

01:05:32.690 --> 01:05:35.409
function exactly where it's
supposed to go,

01:05:35.409 --> 01:05:37.610
it determines a wavelength in
just the right way,

01:05:37.610 --> 01:05:42.329
that if you did interference,
you'll get a pattern you

01:05:42.329 --> 01:05:43.219
observe.
 

01:05:43.219 --> 01:05:47.369
But this is not the right
answer.

01:05:47.369 --> 01:05:52.315
This is not the right answer,
because if you took the square

01:05:52.315 --> 01:05:54.159
of the Y, it's real.
 

01:05:54.159 --> 01:05:56.829
I don't care whether it's
absolute square or square,

01:05:56.829 --> 01:05:59.021
you get cosine squared
px over

01:05:59.021 --> 01:06:05.699
ℏ,
and if you plot that function,

01:06:05.699 --> 01:06:12.139
it's going to look like this,
the incoming wave.

01:06:12.139 --> 01:06:15.706
I'm talking not about
interference but the incoming

01:06:15.706 --> 01:06:17.920
wave, if I write it this way.
 

01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:19.650
But incoming wave,
if it looks like this,

01:06:19.650 --> 01:06:22.909
I have a problem,
because the uncertainty

01:06:22.909 --> 01:06:27.307
principle says Dx
Dpx is of

01:06:27.307 --> 01:06:29.590
order ℏ.
 

01:06:29.590 --> 01:06:32.391
It cannot be smaller,
so the correct statement is,

01:06:32.391 --> 01:06:34.849
it's bigger than
ℏ over some

01:06:34.849 --> 01:06:35.480
number.
 

01:06:35.480 --> 01:06:37.929
Take this function here.
 

01:06:37.929 --> 01:06:42.630
Its momentum is exactly know,
do you agree?

01:06:42.630 --> 01:06:46.422
The uncertainty principle says
if you know the position well,

01:06:46.422 --> 01:06:48.889
you don't know the momentum too
well.

01:06:48.889 --> 01:06:51.851
If you know the momentum
exactly, so Dpx is 0,

01:06:51.851 --> 01:06:55.269
Dx is infinity,
that means you don't know where

01:06:55.269 --> 01:06:55.840
it is.
 

01:06:55.840 --> 01:06:59.666
A particle of perfectly known
momentum has perfectly unknown

01:06:59.666 --> 01:07:00.380
position.
 

01:07:00.380 --> 01:07:04.659
That means the probability of
finding it everywhere should be

01:07:04.659 --> 01:07:05.159
flat.
 

01:07:05.159 --> 01:07:07.070
This is not flat.
 

01:07:07.070 --> 01:07:10.280
It says I'm likely to be here,
not likely to be here,

01:07:10.280 --> 01:07:13.489
likely to be there,
so this function is ruled out.

01:07:13.489 --> 01:07:15.873
Because I want for
Y^(2),

01:07:15.873 --> 01:07:19.873
for a situation where it has a
well defined momentum,

01:07:19.873 --> 01:07:22.949
I want the answer to look like
this.

01:07:22.949 --> 01:07:25.521
The odds of finding it should
be independent of where you are,

01:07:25.521 --> 01:07:27.039
because we don't know where it
is.

01:07:27.039 --> 01:07:30.710
Every place is equally likely.
 

01:07:30.710 --> 01:07:37.050
And yet this function has no
wavelength.

01:07:37.050 --> 01:07:41.998
So how do I sneak in a
wavelength, but not affect this

01:07:41.998 --> 01:07:44.518
flatness of Y^(2)?
 

01:07:44.518 --> 01:07:46.956
Is there a way to write a
function that will have a

01:07:46.956 --> 01:07:49.878
magnitude which is constant but
has a wavelength hidden in it

01:07:49.878 --> 01:07:53.829
somewhere,
so that it can take part in

01:07:53.829 --> 01:07:55.500
interference?
 

01:07:55.500 --> 01:07:56.869
Pardon me?
 

01:07:56.869 --> 01:07:59.099
Any guess?
 

01:07:59.099 --> 01:07:59.800
Yes?
 

01:07:59.800 --> 01:08:00.519
Student: 
&gt;

01:08:00.519 --> 01:08:01.539
Prof: A complex function.
 

01:08:01.539 --> 01:08:04.289
So I'm going to tell you what
the answer is.

01:08:04.289 --> 01:08:07.170
We are driven to that answer.
 

01:08:07.170 --> 01:08:09.619
Here's a function I can write
down,

01:08:09.619 --> 01:08:14.201
which has all the good
properties I want -

01:08:14.201 --> 01:08:20.795
Y(x) looks like
some number Ae^(ipx/

01:08:20.795 --> 01:08:23.029
ℏ).
 

01:08:23.029 --> 01:08:27.788
This is just cosine(px
i) sine(px/ℏ).

01:08:27.788 --> 01:08:32.453
It's got a wavelength,
but the absolute value of

01:08:32.453 --> 01:08:37.613
Y is just A^(2),
because the absolute value of

01:08:37.613 --> 01:08:39.399
this guy is 1.
 

01:08:39.399 --> 01:08:42.060
Ae to the thing looks
like this.

01:08:42.060 --> 01:08:48.193
This is the number A,
this is px/ℏ is the

01:08:48.193 --> 01:08:49.069
angle.
 

01:08:49.069 --> 01:08:55.707
That complex number Y at
a given point x has got a

01:08:55.707 --> 01:08:59.078
magnitude which is just A^(2).
 

01:08:59.078 --> 01:09:02.125
So we are driven to the
conclusion that the correct way

01:09:02.125 --> 01:09:04.720
to describe an electron with
wave function,

01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:09.537
with a momentum p,
is some number in front times

01:09:09.537 --> 01:09:13.186
e^(ipx/ℏ),
because it's got a wavelength

01:09:13.186 --> 01:09:16.317
associated with it,
and it also has an absolute

01:09:16.317 --> 01:09:17.729
value that is flat.
 

01:09:17.729 --> 01:09:19.340
Do you understand why it had to
be flat?

01:09:19.340 --> 01:09:21.951
The uncertainty principle says
if you know its momentum

01:09:21.951 --> 01:09:23.719
precisely,
and you seem to know it,

01:09:23.719 --> 01:09:25.760
because you put a definite
p here,

01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:28.948
you cannot know where it is.
 

01:09:28.948 --> 01:09:32.728
That means the probability for
finding it cannot be dependent

01:09:32.728 --> 01:09:33.609
on position.
 

01:09:33.609 --> 01:09:36.761
Any trigonometric function you
take with some wavelength will

01:09:36.761 --> 01:09:39.336
necessarily oscillate,
preferring some points over

01:09:39.336 --> 01:09:40.229
other points.
 

01:09:40.229 --> 01:09:43.443
The exponential function,
it will oscillate and yet its

01:09:43.443 --> 01:09:45.050
magnitude is independent.
 

01:09:45.050 --> 01:09:47.550
That's a remarkable function.
 

01:09:47.550 --> 01:09:49.920
It's fair to say that if you
did not know complex

01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:51.944
exponentials,
you wouldn't have got beyond

01:09:51.944 --> 01:09:54.658
this point in the development of
quantum mechanics.

01:09:54.658 --> 01:09:59.226
The wave function of an
electron of definite momentum is

01:09:59.226 --> 01:10:01.220
a complex exponential.
 

01:10:01.220 --> 01:10:05.020
This is the sense in which
complex functions enter quantum

01:10:05.020 --> 01:10:07.220
mechanics in an inevitable way.
 

01:10:07.220 --> 01:10:10.038
It's not that the function is
really cosine px/ℏ and

01:10:10.038 --> 01:10:12.529
I'm trying to write it as a real
part of something.

01:10:12.529 --> 01:10:15.520
You need this complex beast.
 

01:10:15.520 --> 01:10:17.630
So the wave functions of
quantum mechanics.

01:10:17.630 --> 01:10:20.259
There are electrons which could
be doing many things,

01:10:20.259 --> 01:10:22.029
each one has a function
Y.

01:10:22.029 --> 01:10:24.869
Electron of definite momentum
we know is a reality.

01:10:24.869 --> 01:10:26.279
It happens all the time.
 

01:10:26.279 --> 01:10:29.962
In CERN they're producing
protons of a definite momentum,

01:10:29.962 --> 01:10:32.199
4 point whatever,
3 point p tev.

01:10:32.199 --> 01:10:33.380
So you know the momentum.
 

01:10:33.380 --> 01:10:36.100
You can ask what function
describes it in quantum theory;

01:10:36.100 --> 01:10:39.420
this is the answer.
 

01:10:39.420 --> 01:10:40.470
This is not derived.
 

01:10:40.470 --> 01:10:42.399
In a way, this is a postulate.
 

01:10:42.399 --> 01:10:44.189
I'm only trying to motivate it.
 

01:10:44.189 --> 01:10:46.850
You cannot derive any of
quantum mechanics,

01:10:46.850 --> 01:10:50.323
except looking at experiments
and trying to see if there is

01:10:50.323 --> 01:10:53.439
some theoretical structure that
will fit the data.

01:10:53.439 --> 01:10:55.762
So I'm going to conclude with
what we have found today,

01:10:55.762 --> 01:10:57.270
and it's probably a little
weird.

01:10:57.270 --> 01:11:01.172
I try to pay attention to that
and I will repeat it every time,

01:11:01.172 --> 01:11:03.439
maybe adding a little extra
stuff.

01:11:03.439 --> 01:11:06.180
So what have you found so far?
 

01:11:06.180 --> 01:11:11.099
It looks like electrons and
photons are all particles and

01:11:11.099 --> 01:11:13.194
waves,
except it's more natural to

01:11:13.194 --> 01:11:15.850
think of light in terms of waves
with the wavelength and

01:11:15.850 --> 01:11:16.479
frequency.
 

01:11:16.479 --> 01:11:19.851
What's surprising is that it's
made up of particles whose

01:11:19.851 --> 01:11:21.960
energy is
ℏw,

01:11:21.960 --> 01:11:24.670
and whose momentum is
ℏk.

01:11:24.670 --> 01:11:28.186
Conversely, particles like
electrons, which have a definite

01:11:28.186 --> 01:11:31.279
momentum, have a wavelength
associated with them.

01:11:31.279 --> 01:11:33.270
And when does the wavelength
come into play?

01:11:33.270 --> 01:11:36.064
Whenever you do an experiment
in which that wavelength is

01:11:36.064 --> 01:11:38.158
comparable to the geometric
dimensions,

01:11:38.158 --> 01:11:41.729
like a double slit experiment
at a single slit diffraction,

01:11:41.729 --> 01:11:45.920
it's the wave that decides
where the electron will go.

01:11:45.920 --> 01:11:49.546
The height squared of the wave
function is proportional to the

01:11:49.546 --> 01:11:52.460
probability the electron will
end up somewhere.

01:11:52.460 --> 01:11:55.673
And also, in a double slit
experiment, it is no longer

01:11:55.673 --> 01:11:59.069
possible to think that the
electron went through one slit

01:11:59.069 --> 01:11:59.979
or another.
 

01:11:59.979 --> 01:12:02.796
You make that assumption,
you cannot avoid the fact that

01:12:02.796 --> 01:12:05.819
when both slits are open,
the numbers should be additive.

01:12:05.819 --> 01:12:08.877
The fact they are not means an
electron knows how many slits

01:12:08.877 --> 01:12:12.091
are open, and only a wave knows
how many slits are open because

01:12:12.091 --> 01:12:13.439
it's going everywhere.
 

01:12:13.439 --> 01:12:16.479
A particle can only look at one
slit at a time.

01:12:16.479 --> 01:12:19.594
In fact, it doesn't know
anything, how many slits there

01:12:19.594 --> 01:12:19.939
are.
 

01:12:19.939 --> 01:12:22.898
It usually bangs itself into
the wall most of the time,

01:12:22.898 --> 01:12:25.252
but sometimes when it goes
through the hole,

01:12:25.252 --> 01:12:26.130
it comes up.
 

01:12:26.130 --> 01:12:30.015
And so what do you think one
should do to complete the

01:12:30.015 --> 01:12:30.750
picture?
 

01:12:30.750 --> 01:12:32.939
What do we need to know?
 

01:12:32.939 --> 01:12:35.328
We need to know many things.
 

01:12:35.328 --> 01:12:39.091
Y(x)^(2) is the
probability that if you look for

01:12:39.091 --> 01:12:41.390
it, you will find it somewhere.
 

01:12:41.390 --> 01:12:44.042
Instead of saying the particle
is at this x in Newtonian

01:12:44.042 --> 01:12:46.118
mechanics,
we're saying it can be at any

01:12:46.118 --> 01:12:48.947
x where Y doesn't
vanish and the odds are

01:12:48.947 --> 01:12:51.880
proportional to the square of
Y at that point.

01:12:51.880 --> 01:12:54.720
Then you can say,
what does the wave function

01:12:54.720 --> 01:12:57.819
look like for a particle of
definite momentum?

01:12:57.819 --> 01:13:00.581
Either you postulate it or try
to follow the arguments I gave,

01:13:00.581 --> 01:13:02.029
but this simply is the answer.
 

01:13:02.029 --> 01:13:04.930
This is the state of definite
momentum.

01:13:04.930 --> 01:13:07.844
And the uncertainty principle
tells you this is an agreement

01:13:07.844 --> 01:13:10.759
to the uncertainty principle
that any attempt to localize an

01:13:10.759 --> 01:13:13.722
electron in space by an amount
Dx leads to a spread in

01:13:13.722 --> 01:13:15.649
momentum in an amount
Dpx.

01:13:15.649 --> 01:13:17.140
That's because it's given by a
wave.

01:13:17.140 --> 01:13:19.707
If you're trying to squeeze the
wave this way,

01:13:19.707 --> 01:13:21.819
it blows up in the other
direction.

01:13:21.819 --> 01:13:24.199
And the odds for finding in
other directions are non 0,

01:13:24.199 --> 01:13:26.757
that means the momentum can
point in many directions coming

01:13:26.757 --> 01:13:27.640
out of the slit.
 

01:13:27.640 --> 01:13:29.368
That's the origin of the
uncertainty principle.

01:13:29.368 --> 01:13:33.680
So I'm going to post whatever I
told you today online.

01:13:33.680 --> 01:13:35.676
You should definitely read it
and it's something you should

01:13:35.676 --> 01:13:37.479
talk about,
not only with your analyst,

01:13:37.479 --> 01:13:39.340
because this can really disturb
you,

01:13:39.340 --> 01:13:41.420
talk about it with your
friends, your neighbors,

01:13:41.420 --> 01:13:43.859
talk about it with senior
students.

01:13:43.859 --> 01:13:46.967
The best thing in quantum is
discussing it with people and

01:13:46.967 --> 01:13:48.550
getting over the weirdness.
 

01:13:48.550 --> 01:13:54.000

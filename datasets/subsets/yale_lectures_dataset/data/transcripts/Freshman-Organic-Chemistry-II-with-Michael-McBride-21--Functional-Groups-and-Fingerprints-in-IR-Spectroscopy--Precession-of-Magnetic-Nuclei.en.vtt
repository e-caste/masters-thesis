00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:02.533
J. MICHAEL MCBRIDE: OK, so you
have the exams back. 

00:00:02.533 --> 00:00:05.233
I'll have a good answer key for
you soon. 

00:00:05.233 --> 00:00:08.500
Currently, the answer key just
has which slides of the 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.933
presentation were the subject of
each question. 

00:00:15.733 --> 00:00:19.967
Maybe good news is that we're
moving on to a new topic. 

00:00:19.967 --> 00:00:21.633
So it's spectroscopy. 

00:00:21.633 --> 00:00:25.533
And last time we started talking
about IR spectroscopy, 

00:00:25.533 --> 00:00:27.700
where the general idea, you
remember, is 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.300
that molecules vibrate. 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.933
If they change their dipole
moment as they vibrate, they 

00:00:35.933 --> 00:00:37.467
can interact with light. 

00:00:37.467 --> 00:00:41.133
That is, the electric vector of
light can cause them to 

00:00:41.133 --> 00:00:43.600
vibrate at a higher amplitude,
but 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.900
always at the same frequency. 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.600
And it's important, as in
pushing a child on a swing, 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.300
that you push at the right time.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.900
If you just go whang, whang,
whang, which some little kids 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.567
do, the person won't go on the
swing. 

00:00:56.567 --> 00:00:58.967
You have to push just when
they're coming back. 

00:00:58.967 --> 00:01:03.100
So the frequency of the light
has to be exactly the same as 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.867
the natural frequency with which
the molecule vibrates. 

00:01:06.867 --> 00:01:10.000
But the molecule can vibrate in
many ways, and these are 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.600
called normal modes, and we were
beginning to illustrate 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.567
those last time. 

00:01:14.567 --> 00:01:18.667
We illustrated it with butane,
but showed the spectrum of 

00:01:18.667 --> 00:01:20.833
octane, which has the same
features. 

00:01:20.833 --> 00:01:23.333
And last time we saw that there
were lots of degrees of 

00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:26.667
freedom, even in butane, many
more in octane. 

00:01:26.667 --> 00:01:30.700
There are 36 normal modes there,
but 72 in octane. 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.467
And we looked at what some of
them were. 

00:01:32.467 --> 00:01:39.467
That that one was the
coordinated stretching of the 

00:01:39.467 --> 00:01:45.300
C-H bonds, as indeed with the
field pushing up and down. 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.867
And the next one, that blue one
there or one of those 

00:01:47.867 --> 00:01:52.400
peaks, is the hydrogens moving
coordinatedly in and out in a 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.367
normal mode, where all vibrate
at exactly the same frequency. 

00:01:56.367 --> 00:01:58.700
And that's the frequency of that
light. 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.467
And that one, notice, the
electric vector goes in and 

00:02:01.467 --> 00:02:05.433
out of the board rather than up
and down. 

00:02:05.433 --> 00:02:07.067
So those were C-H stretches. 

00:02:07.067 --> 00:02:11.667
There are other C-H stretches
like this one, which are sort 

00:02:11.667 --> 00:02:15.100
of a breathing of the hydrogens,
which don't change 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.067
the dipole moment. 

00:02:16.067 --> 00:02:18.167
Therefore light has no handle on
it. 

00:02:18.167 --> 00:02:24.733
And that doesn't appear in the
IR spectrum. 

00:02:24.733 --> 00:02:27.300
There is another kind of
spectroscopy, called Raman 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.033
spectroscopy, which can see that
kind of vibration. 

00:02:31.033 --> 00:02:36.633
And in fact, of the 10 C-H
stretches that combine to give 

00:02:36.633 --> 00:02:41.233
10 normal modes involving C-H
stretching, half of them have 

00:02:41.233 --> 00:02:44.500
no handle, and you can't see
them in the IR. 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:45.900
But we can go on to other peaks.

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.900
Now, those were C-H stretching
at very high frequency. 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.700
Now we're at high low frequency,
the high end of the 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.167
low frequency peaks. 

00:02:54.167 --> 00:02:58.500
And that particular peak is this
motion of the hydrogens. 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.267
What's involved here? 

00:03:02.267 --> 00:03:08.133
If you had to name that kind of
a motion of a CH2 group, 

00:03:08.133 --> 00:03:10.167
that you see in this one, what
would you call it? 

00:03:10.167 --> 00:03:12.400
STUDENT: Scissors. 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.633
PROFESSOR: Exactly, it scissors.

00:03:16.967 --> 00:03:18.233
Then this one-- 

00:03:21.867 --> 00:03:24.567
whoops, I went too far. 

00:03:24.567 --> 00:03:25.700
Whoops, sorry. 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.600
There we go. 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.700
Notice the motion is almost
entirely in the methyl groups 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.467
at the end, not within the
chain. 

00:03:34.467 --> 00:03:35.400
It's a bending. 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.633
It's, in fact, similar to the
scissors motion of the CH2 

00:03:39.633 --> 00:03:42.233
groups, but this one is called
something else. 

00:03:42.233 --> 00:03:44.767
Could you give it a fanciful
name, of what one 

00:03:44.767 --> 00:03:46.367
methyl group is doing? 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.333
It's called the umbrella mode. 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.167
This little peak here turns out
to be this motion. 

00:04:03.867 --> 00:04:07.067
See how they're wagging back and
forth and any given CH2 is 

00:04:07.067 --> 00:04:09.767
going like this? 

00:04:09.767 --> 00:04:17.367
Sorry, there we go. 

00:04:17.367 --> 00:04:20.900
And this last peak down here is
this one. 

00:04:24.233 --> 00:04:28.167
So the CH2's are going like
this, and 

00:04:28.167 --> 00:04:29.767
that's the rocking mode. 

00:04:29.767 --> 00:04:33.767
So bear in mind that we're
illustrating with butane but 

00:04:33.767 --> 00:04:36.467
showing octane, but they have
these same motions. 

00:04:36.467 --> 00:04:41.867
Obviously, octane has those same
motions as butane does. 

00:04:41.867 --> 00:04:44.467
And they're all coordinated
together at the same 

00:04:44.467 --> 00:04:48.000
frequency, so it's a normal
mode. 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.900
And obviously, the ones that
appear in the 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:51.967
spectrum are IR active. 

00:04:51.967 --> 00:04:54.267
So now, how about functional
groups? 

00:04:54.267 --> 00:04:56.533
Here we were looking just at a
saturated alkane. 

00:04:56.533 --> 00:04:59.200
What IR is especially good for
is 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.033
identifying functional groups. 

00:05:02.033 --> 00:05:05.800
So that was octane, and here's
octyne. 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.133
Incidentally, what does -yne
mean as a suffix?

00:05:09.833 --> 00:05:10.267
STUDENT: A triple bond. 

00:05:10.267 --> 00:05:11.533
PROFESSOR: It means a triple
bond. 

00:05:11.533 --> 00:05:16.667
And methylacetylene is methyl on
a triple bond, not methyl 

00:05:16.667 --> 00:05:17.667
on a double bond. 

00:05:17.667 --> 00:05:20.833
That gave some people problems
on the exam. 

00:05:20.833 --> 00:05:24.167
OK, so most of the peaks are the
same. 

00:05:24.167 --> 00:05:26.867
In fact, there's one peak here,
that one, which is 

00:05:26.867 --> 00:05:28.533
almost precisely the same. 

00:05:28.533 --> 00:05:30.367
Do you remember what that one
was 

00:05:32.933 --> 00:05:36.167
in octane? Well, we'll 

00:05:37.533 --> 00:05:38.367
see in just a second. 

00:05:38.367 --> 00:05:42.067
And now, look at-- that was
4-octyne, and now if we look 

00:05:42.067 --> 00:05:43.667
at 1-octyne-- 

00:05:43.667 --> 00:05:45.433
a triple bond in a different
position at 

00:05:45.433 --> 00:05:47.033
the last two carbons-- 

00:05:47.033 --> 00:05:50.300
then we see exactly that same
peak again. 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:55.500
So all these things, octane,
4-octyne, 1-octyne, all have 

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:58.667
that sharp peak that's circled
there. 

00:05:58.667 --> 00:05:59.900
And it's this motion. 

00:06:04.567 --> 00:06:08.033
It's that same umbrella motion.

00:06:08.033 --> 00:06:10.100
And why is it so special? 

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:12.000
Why does it occur at exactly the
same 

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.567
place in all of these? 

00:06:13.567 --> 00:06:15.700
Because it has its own
frequency, a certain 

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:17.533
frequency, different from the
frequencies of 

00:06:17.533 --> 00:06:19.733
the neighboring CH2. 

00:06:19.733 --> 00:06:22.200
So it doesn't couple with them.

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:25.067
It's a bad energy match for that
frequency with the 

00:06:25.067 --> 00:06:28.067
neighbors, so it doesn't couple
very much. 

00:06:28.067 --> 00:06:32.133
So it stands alone, and is the
same, in octane, in octyne, 

00:06:32.133 --> 00:06:36.533
also in octene, as you'll see
shortly. 

00:06:36.533 --> 00:06:37.833
OK, so that's that one. 

00:06:37.833 --> 00:06:41.100
Now, there are some other peaks
here that are new. 

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:46.067
Like, there's one at really high
frequency, 3315. 

00:06:46.067 --> 00:06:47.100
Now what's that? 

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:51.133
Here's the molecule, and watch
its motion. 

00:06:51.133 --> 00:06:52.400
What's mostly happening? 

00:06:55.633 --> 00:07:00.700
And why is it different from
anything you saw in octane? 

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:02.367
At higher frequency. 

00:07:02.367 --> 00:07:05.933
First, what's moving mostly? 

00:07:05.933 --> 00:07:06.633
Ayesha? 

00:07:06.633 --> 00:07:08.000
STUDENT: The C-H bond. 

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.967
PROFESSOR: The C-H bond is
stretching. 

00:07:09.967 --> 00:07:13.900
And why is the stretching of
this C-H bond different from 

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:18.967
the stretching of the bonds we
saw in octane? 

00:07:18.967 --> 00:07:21.933
Why is it a different frequency,
so that it doesn't 

00:07:21.933 --> 00:07:24.333
mix up with other things? 

00:07:24.333 --> 00:07:28.333
Bad energy match, it doesn't
mix. 

00:07:28.333 --> 00:07:28.833
Ayesha? 

00:07:28.833 --> 00:07:30.867
STUDENT: It's in the plane...

00:07:30.867 --> 00:07:31.767
PROFESSOR: Can't hear very well.

00:07:31.767 --> 00:07:32.700
STUDENT: It's in the plane of
the molecule. 

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:33.167
PROFESSOR: It's true 

00:07:33.167 --> 00:07:34.000
that it's in the plane. 

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
In fact, it's in the line in
this case. 

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.033
All the atoms except for three
hydrogens are on a line. 

00:07:40.033 --> 00:07:43.300
But what's special about that
C-H bond 

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:45.700
as compared to others? 

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:49.100
We've seen things special about
an acetylene C-H bond 

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:52.767
before in its chemistry. 

00:07:52.767 --> 00:07:54.667
STUDENT: It's sp hybridized. 

00:07:54.667 --> 00:07:56.300
PROFESSOR: It's sp hybridized.

00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:57.533
Remember, it's acidic. 

00:07:57.533 --> 00:07:59.200
It's unusually acidic. 

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:03.700
25 is its pKa, because it's a
C-H bond, so it's much 

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:06.300
stronger than the others. 

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:09.300
So it's at higher frequency, as
you'd expect 

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:12.000
for a stronger spring. 

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.467
OK, now, at the other end of the
spectrum, there's this 

00:08:14.467 --> 00:08:18.167
really strong peak at 630, and
that's this motion. 

00:08:22.567 --> 00:08:25.700
It's bending the hydrogen up and
down, 

00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:27.733
bending that C-H bond. 

00:08:27.733 --> 00:08:32.400
And that turns out to be much
easier than bending bonds that 

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:35.400
are normally hybridized. 

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:36.667
So that's that bending. 

00:08:36.667 --> 00:08:38.367
So that's characteristic of
having an 

00:08:38.367 --> 00:08:40.200
acetylene in a molecule. 

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:44.067
If it's a terminal acetylene at
the end of the chain, 

00:08:44.067 --> 00:08:45.100
you'll have these. 

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:47.167
If it's not at the end of the
chain, then you don't have 

00:08:47.167 --> 00:08:52.833
this kind of C-H. Now, what's
this peak here at 2120? 

00:08:52.833 --> 00:08:55.033
Give me some thoughts about what
that might be. 

00:08:55.033 --> 00:08:58.633
What kind of peaks come at the
far left of the spectrum, at 

00:08:58.633 --> 00:09:00.667
very high frequency? 

00:09:00.667 --> 00:09:01.433
STUDENT: C-H. 

00:09:01.433 --> 00:09:02.267
PROFESSOR: C-H's, 

00:09:02.267 --> 00:09:04.767
because the H is so light. 

00:09:04.767 --> 00:09:08.667
And then when you get bendings
of C-H's or stretchings of 

00:09:08.667 --> 00:09:12.333
C-C, those come in the right
half of the spectrum. 

00:09:12.333 --> 00:09:15.200
So this particular peak at 2120
is in 

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:17.267
what's a window usually. 

00:09:17.267 --> 00:09:18.900
Usually, there's nothing...
There must be something

00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:21.800
really special that vibrates at
that frequency.

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:24.100
Any idea of what could make
something... 

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:27.067
It's not a C-H bond. 

00:09:27.067 --> 00:09:31.167
It must be a C-C bond, but it's
a very special C-C bond. 

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:32.667
STUDENT: Triple bond.

00:09:32.667 --> 00:09:33.167
PROFESSOR: What is it that would
vibrate at a very high

00:09:33.167 --> 00:09:33.900
frequency? Derek? 

00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:34.600
STUDENT: The triple bond 

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:36.400
PROFESSOR: The triple bond is
three times 

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:39.533
as strong as a single bond, so
it comes at unusually high 

00:09:39.533 --> 00:09:43.933
frequency for a CC bond, and
here is its motion. 

00:09:43.933 --> 00:09:45.200
Whoops. 

00:09:47.367 --> 00:09:48.767
So it's a CC bond stretching. 

00:09:52.933 --> 00:09:58.167
Now, notice that in the spectrum
of 4-octyne, the blue 

00:09:58.167 --> 00:10:00.767
spectrum, you don't have that
peak. 

00:10:00.767 --> 00:10:06.267
Why don't you see the triple
bond stretching in 4-octyne? 

00:10:06.267 --> 00:10:08.633
How many carbons are there in
octyne? 

00:10:08.633 --> 00:10:10.633
STUDENT: They cancel out. 

00:10:10.633 --> 00:10:10.867
PROFESSOR: Right. 

00:10:10.867 --> 00:10:13.133
There's no change in the dipole
moment, because it's 

00:10:13.133 --> 00:10:15.567
symmetrical as you move like
that. 

00:10:15.567 --> 00:10:18.533
If it's at the end of the chain,
it's unsymmetrical, 

00:10:18.533 --> 00:10:19.267
and you can see it. 

00:10:19.267 --> 00:10:21.267
But if it's in the middle of the
chain, it doesn't change 

00:10:21.267 --> 00:10:22.667
the dipole moment. 

00:10:22.667 --> 00:10:25.900
OK, so you can tell the
difference in two ways here, 

00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:28.600
between a triple bond that's at
the end of the chain and a 

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:31.333
triple bond that's in the middle
of the chain. 

00:10:31.333 --> 00:10:33.500
OK, so there's no handle for the
light to 

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:35.233
interact with that one. 

00:10:35.233 --> 00:10:36.467
So we've seen octane. 

00:10:36.467 --> 00:10:40.900
We've seen octynes, two octynes,
the 4 and the 1. 

00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:43.767
Now let's look at octene, a
different functional group. 

00:10:43.767 --> 00:10:48.000
So again, most of the peaks look
exactly the same, because 

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.633
they have long chains of CH2. 

00:10:50.633 --> 00:10:53.933
But it's trans-4-octene, so
there's a 

00:10:53.933 --> 00:10:56.800
carbon-carbon double bond. 

00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:02.667
Now, there's this big peak at
967. 

00:11:02.667 --> 00:11:03.633
Now what could that be? 

00:11:03.633 --> 00:11:05.167
Now here's cis. 

00:11:05.167 --> 00:11:09.767
That was trans-4-octene, here's
cis-4-octene. 

00:11:09.767 --> 00:11:13.367
And now you see a peak at 1655.

00:11:13.367 --> 00:11:14.600
What do you suppose that is? 

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:20.667
It's not involved in an H. It's
very high frequency, but 

00:11:20.667 --> 00:11:24.033
it doesn't involve H. Those are
up around 3000. 

00:11:24.033 --> 00:11:25.600
Any ideas for this one? 

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:27.300
STUDENT: The double bonding
stretching. 

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:28.167
PROFESSOR: The double bond
stretching. 

00:11:28.167 --> 00:11:32.400
Now, why do you see it in
cis-4-octene, but you don't 

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:33.667
see it in trans-4-octene? 

00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:41.700
So that's stretching can be
symmetrical, right? 

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:45.467
And if it's a trans double
bond, like this, then it truly

00:11:45.467 --> 00:11:46.800
is symmetrical.

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:49.733
There's a center of symmetry
there. 

00:11:49.733 --> 00:11:54.733
But if it's cis-4-octene, then
if you stretch the double bond 

00:11:54.733 --> 00:11:59.800
and change the bonds from carbon
to carbon, you change 

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:01.167
the dipole moment in this 

00:12:01.167 --> 00:12:04.867
direction, not in this
direction. 

00:12:04.867 --> 00:12:08.300
So if you have it cis like
that, then the dipole change 

00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:10.567
is actually in a different
direction. 

00:12:10.567 --> 00:12:13.733
Of course, normally you measure
these spectra on 

00:12:13.733 --> 00:12:17.033
solutions, so there'll be some
molecules 

00:12:17.033 --> 00:12:18.733
that are oriented properly. 

00:12:18.733 --> 00:12:22.800
But if you had molecules that
were fixed, like in a crystal, 

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:25.733
you could tell which way the
double bonds were oriented, by 

00:12:25.733 --> 00:12:29.333
seeing which direction the
electric vector could 

00:12:29.333 --> 00:12:31.167
interact with it. 

00:12:31.167 --> 00:12:32.967
But notice that down at the low
frequency 

00:12:32.967 --> 00:12:35.900
end that has a big peak at 710,
whereas the 

00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:40.933
trans isomer had 967. 

00:12:40.933 --> 00:12:44.833
Now, what was the really low
frequency peak 

00:12:44.833 --> 00:12:46.400
in acetylene, remember, 

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:52.000
in the 1-octyne? Remember the
one was really down low?

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.133
STUDENT: The Bending. 

00:12:53.133 --> 00:12:54.500
PROFESSOR: That was the
bending of the C-H.

00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:55.767
So these are down low,

00:12:55.767 --> 00:12:59.167
they could be bending of
the C-H.

00:12:59.167 --> 00:13:03.633
And let's, just to compare, look
at a double bond that has 

00:13:03.633 --> 00:13:06.500
three carbons on it, so just
one H that

00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:08.067
could bend out of plane. 

00:13:08.067 --> 00:13:11.067
And it has a peak at 828. 

00:13:11.067 --> 00:13:13.400
Now, of course, the others that
don't have that extra 

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:18.867
methyl group are cis and
trans, but have two H's, two 

00:13:18.867 --> 00:13:22.400
H's cis, or two H's trans. 

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:25.567
And they'll couple as they
vibrate, because they're near 

00:13:25.567 --> 00:13:26.867
one another. 

00:13:26.867 --> 00:13:31.867
So there's perfect energy match
of these two. 

00:13:31.867 --> 00:13:34.933
So if you have any overlap, any
coupling mechanism, 

00:13:34.933 --> 00:13:39.367
mechanical coupling, if one can
feel the other vibrating, 

00:13:39.367 --> 00:13:43.933
then you should get two
vibrations, coupled vibrations.

00:13:43.933 --> 00:13:47.700
That is, if we look at it this
way, you have the 828, which 

00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:51.967
is a single H, but if you had
two of them at 828, and they 

00:13:51.967 --> 00:13:55.900
could interact, you'd get a
higher peak and a lower peak, 

00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:58.400
which looks like what we see, in
a way. 

00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:01.300
But the higher peak comes in one
compound, and the lower 

00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:03.167
peak comes in another one. 

00:14:03.167 --> 00:14:05.467
Where is the second of those two
peaks 

00:14:05.467 --> 00:14:08.067
that got mixed together? 

00:14:08.067 --> 00:14:09.633
We could turn it that way to see
the 

00:14:09.633 --> 00:14:14.433
analogue to orbital mixing. 

00:14:14.433 --> 00:14:17.800
So let's look at pictures of
these vibrations. 

00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:19.767
At the top, you see, is the
molecule that 

00:14:19.767 --> 00:14:21.567
has just one hydrogen. 

00:14:21.567 --> 00:14:24.967
At the bottom, on the left, are
two hydrogens on the 

00:14:24.967 --> 00:14:27.067
double bond trans, and on
the right,

00:14:27.067 --> 00:14:28.700
they're cis to one another. 

00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:32.467
Now, this is the vibration we're
looking at, out-of-plane 

00:14:32.467 --> 00:14:34.733
vibration of the C-H. Everybody
see 

00:14:34.733 --> 00:14:37.000
what I'm talking about? 

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.933
It's out-of-plane vibration of
the C-H at the top. 

00:14:39.933 --> 00:14:41.967
Now, at the bottom, there are
two CH's. 

00:14:41.967 --> 00:14:46.333
And notice that in this
vibration, those two H's move 

00:14:46.333 --> 00:14:49.033
in the same direction, both up
and both 

00:14:49.033 --> 00:14:50.467
down at the same time. 

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.867
Why don't I show the one where
one moves up and the other 

00:14:56.867 --> 00:14:57.767
moves down? 

00:14:57.767 --> 00:15:01.100
Why isn't that relevant for our
discussion? 

00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:03.700
Because there's no dipole moment
for that one. 

00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:04.467
It cancels. 

00:15:04.467 --> 00:15:07.433
One went up, the other went
down. 

00:15:07.433 --> 00:15:11.600
So to be IR active, to interact
with the light, they 

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:14.400
have to move the same direction.

00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:18.067
But notice, this is interesting,
so they move in 

00:15:18.067 --> 00:15:19.633
the same direction to be active.

00:15:19.633 --> 00:15:22.733
That one is at 828. 

00:15:22.733 --> 00:15:25.367
This one, notice that when they
both move up, 

00:15:25.367 --> 00:15:27.333
it twists the bond. 

00:15:27.333 --> 00:15:29.967
See how it twists the center
carbon bond when the two 

00:15:29.967 --> 00:15:31.800
hydrogens move up. 

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:33.200
But on the right... 

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:35.267
so that reduces the pi overlap.

00:15:35.267 --> 00:15:38.333
It weakens the pi bond when
those p orbitals 

00:15:38.333 --> 00:15:39.967
don't overlap as well... 

00:15:39.967 --> 00:15:42.933
But on the right, when they both
move the same direction, 

00:15:42.933 --> 00:15:44.867
the p orbitals still point so
that they 

00:15:44.867 --> 00:15:46.667
overlap with one another. 

00:15:46.667 --> 00:15:49.700
So the one on the left is harder
to do because it 

00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:51.433
weakens the bond. 

00:15:51.433 --> 00:15:54.133
It distorts the bond, whereas
the one on the right 

00:15:54.133 --> 00:15:56.067
doesn't distort the bond. 

00:15:56.067 --> 00:15:58.700
So the one on the left is harder
to do 

00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:00.367
and it's higher frequency. 

00:16:00.367 --> 00:16:03.267
So folding preserves the
overlap. 

00:16:03.267 --> 00:16:06.633
The harder one and the easier
one. The harder one is high 

00:16:06.633 --> 00:16:09.667
frequency, the easier one is low
frequency. 

00:16:09.667 --> 00:16:13.400
So you can understand why you
see only-- when these two 

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:16.567
vibrations mix-- why you see
only one. 

00:16:16.567 --> 00:16:19.967
You only see the one where they
move in parallel. 

00:16:19.967 --> 00:16:22.767
And it's easier if they're like
this, than if they're 

00:16:22.767 --> 00:16:25.533
like this, where you're twisting
the bond as well. 

00:16:25.533 --> 00:16:30.033
So not only are the high- and
low- frequency peak handy, 

00:16:30.033 --> 00:16:33.833
because they diagnose being a
cis or a trans double bond, 

00:16:33.833 --> 00:16:36.533
you can tell which one you have,
but also you can 

00:16:36.533 --> 00:16:39.433
understand what it tells you
about the bonding, why you 

00:16:39.433 --> 00:16:43.033
have one that's high and the
other low. 

00:16:43.033 --> 00:16:48.233
OK, but the real jewel in the
crown of infrared spectroscopy 

00:16:48.233 --> 00:16:49.833
is the carbonyl group. 

00:16:49.833 --> 00:16:52.467
Why should it be such a great
group? 

00:16:52.467 --> 00:16:55.433
Why should it be so good in
infrared spectroscopy? 

00:16:55.433 --> 00:16:59.067
Why should it stand out and be
something that you can really 

00:16:59.067 --> 00:17:02.567
identify what kind of carbonyl
group you have? 

00:17:02.567 --> 00:17:05.100
First, it absorbs very strongly.

00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:07.267
It interacts very strongly with
light. 

00:17:07.267 --> 00:17:09.600
What determines how strongly
something 

00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:11.200
interacts with light? 

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:13.700
How much you can push the atoms
with the 

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:17.367
electric field of light? 

00:17:17.367 --> 00:17:18.867
Luke, you got an idea? 

00:17:18.867 --> 00:17:22.200
STUDENT: It's the number of
electrons? 

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:23.167
PROFESSOR: Not just the
number of

00:17:23.167 --> 00:17:26.100
electrons, but how much the
dipole moment 

00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:27.800
changes when you stretch. 

00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:33.433
If the electrons change a lot
when you stretch it, and it 

00:17:33.433 --> 00:17:36.833
becomes much more plus-minus, if
the plus-minus get 

00:17:36.833 --> 00:17:42.467
separated more, then that's a
strong interaction with light. 

00:17:42.467 --> 00:17:46.700
And the C-O is a polar bond, so
it changes much more than 

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:49.033
a C-H bond does as it vibrates.

00:17:49.033 --> 00:17:50.900
So it's going to be a very
strong peak. 

00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:54.733
It's not going to be one of
these wimpy little peaks. 

00:17:54.733 --> 00:17:59.900
Now, why does it stand out in
its frequency? 

00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:03.467
From one molecule to the next,
you don't have to worry so 

00:18:03.467 --> 00:18:06.267
much about the coupling in
interpreting it. 

00:18:06.267 --> 00:18:10.200
A certain ketone, a ketone will
always be very near where 

00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:13.867
another ketone is, at the same
frequency. 

00:18:13.867 --> 00:18:14.833
Why? 

00:18:14.833 --> 00:18:18.233
Because that bond is a double
bond and nearby bonds aren't 

00:18:18.233 --> 00:18:19.700
double bonds. 

00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:23.000
So the nearby bonds that it
could couple its vibration 

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.200
with have very different
frequency. 

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:28.933
So you have very little overlap,
so you don't change 

00:18:28.933 --> 00:18:30.600
the frequency very much when it

00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:32.167
interacts with its neighbors. 

00:18:32.167 --> 00:18:36.133
So it stands alone and is
characteristic of a particular 

00:18:36.133 --> 00:18:39.333
kind of carbonyl, and it's very
strong so that you can 

00:18:39.333 --> 00:18:42.000
see it in the IR spectrum
easily. 

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.800
OK, so that's why these are so
great, the carbonyls. 

00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:46.533
So here's a ketone-- 

00:18:46.533 --> 00:18:49.533
or pardon me, an aldehyde,
acetaldehyde. 

00:18:49.533 --> 00:18:52.600
Notice how very strong a peak it
is. 

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:55.700
It's strong and it's
independent. 

00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:59.133
It doesn't mix much with its
neighbors. 

00:18:59.133 --> 00:19:01.967
Now, there's a ketone, right? 

00:19:01.967 --> 00:19:02.733
Acetone. 

00:19:02.733 --> 00:19:07.367
Notice it's about 12 cm-1 lower
frequency, but 

00:19:07.367 --> 00:19:10.733
that's reproducible. 

00:19:10.733 --> 00:19:13.400
The ketones would come at a
little higher frequency, 

00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:15.400
aldehydes come at a little lower
frequency-- 

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:16.667
or pardon me, vice versa. 

00:19:16.667 --> 00:19:19.967
So you can tell which is which.

00:19:19.967 --> 00:19:23.533
Now, here's an amide, where we
put a nitrogen on the 

00:19:23.533 --> 00:19:25.600
carbon=oxygen double bond. 

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:27.167
Now, that went to a
substantially 

00:19:27.167 --> 00:19:29.867
lower frequency, 1681. 

00:19:29.867 --> 00:19:34.567
Why should the C-O bond, double
bond of an amide, be 

00:19:34.567 --> 00:19:38.933
weak and vibrate at lower
frequency, a weaker spring? 

00:19:38.933 --> 00:19:43.833
Anybody got an idea of how the
nitrogen would do that to the 

00:19:43.833 --> 00:19:46.133
C-O double bond? 

00:19:46.133 --> 00:19:47.867
Yigit how about you? 

00:19:47.867 --> 00:19:51.167
STUDENT: The interaction between
the lone pair of 

00:19:51.167 --> 00:19:53.933
nitrogen and the pi*-- 

00:19:53.933 --> 00:19:54.700
PROFESSOR: And pi*. 

00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:58.567
So you put electrons from the
nitrogen into the antibonding 

00:19:58.567 --> 00:20:02.267
orbital of the C=O, weakening
the C=O bond and lowering its 

00:20:02.267 --> 00:20:03.800
vibration frequency. 

00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:08.000
So there's the unshared pair, we
mix them with pi*, and 

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.200
it gets to 1681. 

00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:14.167
So the C=O is weakened by
resonance, by 

00:20:14.167 --> 00:20:16.567
occupancy of the pi*. 

00:20:16.567 --> 00:20:21.367
OK, now, suppose we look at an
ester, where we have an oxygen 

00:20:21.367 --> 00:20:22.233
next to the carbonyl. 

00:20:22.233 --> 00:20:24.600
Can I get someone to predict
that for me? 

00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:25.867
Po-Yi, what do you think? 

00:20:25.867 --> 00:20:29.667
Where is the ester going to
come, compared to, say, a 

00:20:29.667 --> 00:20:33.633
ketone and the amide, the one
with nitrogen? 

00:20:36.367 --> 00:20:40.200
STUDENT: Well, there will still
be resonance. 

00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:41.400
PROFESSOR: There'll still be
resonance. 

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:42.733
It's an unshared pair on oxygen.

00:20:42.733 --> 00:20:45.633
Should it be as strong as that
involving the nitrogen? 

00:20:45.633 --> 00:20:46.433
STUDENT: No. 

00:20:46.433 --> 00:20:47.667
PROFESSOR: Why? 

00:20:52.567 --> 00:20:54.533
Why should mixing of the 

00:20:54.533 --> 00:20:59.033
electrons into the pi* be weaker
for oxygen than it is 

00:20:59.033 --> 00:21:00.333
for nitrogen? 

00:21:04.567 --> 00:21:06.767
Here are the electrons on the
atom we're interested in, on 

00:21:06.767 --> 00:21:08.433
oxygen or nitrogen. 

00:21:08.433 --> 00:21:10.400
STUDENT: Bad energy-match? 

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:12.067
PROFESSOR: But oxygen, as you
say, has a 

00:21:12.067 --> 00:21:13.233
higher nuclear charge. 

00:21:13.233 --> 00:21:15.000
Lower it doesn't mix as much. 

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.767
So it shouldn't lower the
frequency as much as 1681. 

00:21:18.767 --> 00:21:21.500
So I think you would predict
that it'd be someplace between 

00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:24.367
1715 and 1681. 

00:21:24.367 --> 00:21:25.433
Make sense? 

00:21:25.433 --> 00:21:26.767
Yep. 

00:21:26.767 --> 00:21:31.133
There it is, it's higher
frequency, 1746! 

00:21:31.133 --> 00:21:32.767
So there's something different.

00:21:32.767 --> 00:21:35.067
Not only is it not as good as
nitrogen, it goes 

00:21:35.067 --> 00:21:36.833
the opposite direction. 

00:21:36.833 --> 00:21:38.600
Now how about if we put a
halogen 

00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:41.267
on there, like chlorine? 

00:21:41.267 --> 00:21:44.700
That's higher still, 1806. 

00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:48.100
It's true its electron pair is
lower, so it 

00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:49.033
won't mix as much. 

00:21:49.033 --> 00:21:51.900
It won't weaken it as much as
nitrogen did. 

00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:54.800
But why does it strengthen it to
have a halogen there? 

00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:00.933
So here's a different kind of
resonance. 

00:22:00.933 --> 00:22:04.000
You have an unshared pair-- on
the on the right, we used an 

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.500
unshared pair of the adjacent
atom to 

00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:08.400
interact with the carbonyl. 

00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:11.100
Now we're going to use an
unshared pair on the oxygen of 

00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:15.967
the carbonyl to mix with an
orbital of the C-X bond. 

00:22:15.967 --> 00:22:18.367
What orbital could that mix
with? 

00:22:18.367 --> 00:22:22.533
It could mix with sigma*. 

00:22:22.533 --> 00:22:27.333
So if you mix that with sigma*,
then you 

00:22:27.333 --> 00:22:29.167
strengthen the C=O bond. 

00:22:29.167 --> 00:22:33.600
You get a triple bond between
oxygen and carbon, and occupy 

00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:34.233
sigma star. 

00:22:34.233 --> 00:22:37.600
So the appropriate resonance
structure would be one with no 

00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:39.767
bond to that X group. 

00:22:39.767 --> 00:22:43.533
Of course, that's not the
dominant structure, but it's 

00:22:43.533 --> 00:22:45.900
one that causes the bond to get

00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:46.900
the C=O bond 

00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:47.833
to get stronger. 

00:22:47.833 --> 00:22:49.700
So it moves to high frequency. 

00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:51.800
So we can see that that
interaction is important. 

00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:56.100
And in this case, the mixing
with the sigma*, the C-O 

00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:57.667
is strengthened by resonance. 

00:22:57.667 --> 00:23:00.367
So in the case of amide, it was
weakened by resonance. 

00:23:00.367 --> 00:23:02.867
In this case, it's strengthened
by resonance. 

00:23:02.867 --> 00:23:06.667
In that case, it was a pi
interaction, putting electrons 

00:23:06.667 --> 00:23:07.933
in pi*. 

00:23:07.933 --> 00:23:11.967
In this one, it's putting
electrons in sigma*, and 

00:23:11.967 --> 00:23:15.567
making a triple bond. 

00:23:15.567 --> 00:23:17.267
Look at this case here, where we
have a 

00:23:17.267 --> 00:23:19.267
C=C double bond. 

00:23:19.267 --> 00:23:23.100
Now we don't have the low
sigma*, so we're not going 

00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:26.433
to get the effect we got in the
acid, and the acid 

00:23:26.433 --> 00:23:28.667
chloride and the ester. 

00:23:28.667 --> 00:23:31.967
And we have pi electrons that
could do the mixing. 

00:23:31.967 --> 00:23:34.533
So that looks like a case where
this resonance structure 

00:23:34.533 --> 00:23:37.867
could be significant, and it
would weaken 

00:23:37.867 --> 00:23:40.900
the C=O double bond. 

00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:44.000
But the peak is, in fact, at
higher frequency than a 

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.733
ketone, 1720. 

00:23:46.733 --> 00:23:48.300
Now, why is this so? 

00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:52.767
Notice that in this case, you
have two double bonds 

00:23:52.767 --> 00:23:56.667
separated only by one single
bond, so they both have a 

00:23:56.667 --> 00:23:59.467
better energy match, these
double bonds, than when you 

00:23:59.467 --> 00:24:04.533
had a double bond and only
single bonds in the vicinity. 

00:24:04.533 --> 00:24:05.833
So now you can mix them. 

00:24:05.833 --> 00:24:09.967
You can make them in-phase and
out-of-phase. 

00:24:09.967 --> 00:24:12.567
And here, notice that one is
stretching while 

00:24:12.567 --> 00:24:14.167
the other is shrinking. 

00:24:14.167 --> 00:24:17.233
It's out of phase, and it's
mostly a vibration of the C=O. 

00:24:17.233 --> 00:24:22.200
 And that's the one that's at
high frequency. 

00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:25.967
And notice it's a double peak,
because you have the other one 

00:24:25.967 --> 00:24:27.600
when they're in phase as well. 

00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:33.400
And here's the one where it's in
phase and it's mostly a 

00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:36.833
vibration of the C=C, rather
than the C=O. 

00:24:36.833 --> 00:24:38.200
But notice, they're both 

00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:41.233
stretching at the same time. 

00:24:41.233 --> 00:24:42.633
So we have this situation. 

00:24:42.633 --> 00:24:51.700
We mix them, and we get 1720 and
1683? 

00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:55.700
Notice there's this peak at
1618. 

00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:59.400
This is a really neat case,
because the doubling that you 

00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:02.700
see in that strong peak isn't
what you think it is. 

00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:06.500
It's not the in-phase and the
out-of-phase. 

00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:10.233
What is the 1618? 

00:25:10.233 --> 00:25:13.800
And what's the source of the
doubling? 

00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:17.067
Well, here's a spectrum of
methyl vinyl ketone, that same 

00:25:17.067 --> 00:25:20.367
compound with a double bond
adjacent to the carbonyl, 

00:25:20.367 --> 00:25:24.167
measured in argon at 13 k. 

00:25:24.167 --> 00:25:29.833
And you can see it's got those
two peaks, 1718, 1696, but 

00:25:29.833 --> 00:25:32.000
then it's got that 1623. 

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.667
These aren't exactly the same
frequencies we saw in the 

00:25:34.667 --> 00:25:37.700
previous slide, because that was
measured in solution, this 

00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:39.500
is measured in an argon solid. 

00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:41.000
So there's a little influence of
the 

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.700
neighbors on the frequency. 

00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:48.233
But if you photolyze that at 308
nanometers for two and a 

00:25:48.233 --> 00:25:52.900
half hours, and then look at the
difference between the 

00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:58.000
spectrum you have now and the
spectrum you had before, see 

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.033
that some peaks have gotten
stronger, they point up, and 

00:26:02.033 --> 00:26:04.067
those that have gotten weaker,
if you take the 

00:26:04.067 --> 00:26:06.833
difference, go down. 

00:26:06.833 --> 00:26:12.233
So you see that peak at 1696
went down, not up. 

00:26:12.233 --> 00:26:14.867
So what does this mean? 

00:26:14.867 --> 00:26:18.367
It means that there are two
different compounds there. 

00:26:18.367 --> 00:26:23.033
One is becoming the other, so
the one that's being formed is 

00:26:23.033 --> 00:26:25.800
getting stronger, the one that's
going away is getting 

00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:30.833
weaker and appears negative when
you do the difference. 

00:26:30.833 --> 00:26:32.833
And that's 1696. 

00:26:32.833 --> 00:26:36.400
So that original doublet we
looked at is not from the same 

00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:38.133
compound, those two peaks,
they're from 

00:26:38.133 --> 00:26:40.167
two different compounds. 

00:26:40.167 --> 00:26:47.700
But the 1696, if photolyzed, can
become the 1718. 

00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:51.400
So if you calculate the
positions for that compound 

00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:54.767
shown at the top, you see the
C=O, and the C=C, 

00:26:54.767 --> 00:26:59.800
so those are the 1718 and 1623.

00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:00.567
We got that. 

00:27:00.567 --> 00:27:02.000
That's that compound. 

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.767
So the in-phase and the
out-of-phase vibrations. 

00:27:04.767 --> 00:27:06.633
What's the other one? 

00:27:06.633 --> 00:27:07.867
It's this. 

00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:12.433
What's the difference? 

00:27:12.433 --> 00:27:15.733
It's the conformation around
that central bond. 

00:27:15.733 --> 00:27:20.367
They're both planar, but one is
like eclipsed and the other 

00:27:20.367 --> 00:27:21.600
is like anti. 

00:27:25.167 --> 00:27:29.267
And if you calculate the spectra
for the one where the 

00:27:29.267 --> 00:27:32.267
two double bonds are trans to
one another, you see a very 

00:27:32.267 --> 00:27:34.567
strong peak at 1696, and hardly

00:27:34.567 --> 00:27:36.400
anything at the low frequency. 

00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:39.200
Why is there hardly anything at
the low frequency? 

00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:42.333
Because that one, which is
mostly a C=C vibration and a 

00:27:42.333 --> 00:27:46.633
little bit of coupled C=O, has
them so that one tends to 

00:27:46.633 --> 00:27:48.067
cancel the other. 

00:27:48.067 --> 00:27:53.867
The C=O doesn't move very much
but it's a big dipole, so it 

00:27:53.867 --> 00:27:54.767
can cancel it. 

00:27:54.767 --> 00:27:59.367
And at the top, they reinforce
one another, so the mostly C=C 

00:27:59.367 --> 00:28:02.033
vibration is rather strong,
because the C=O 

00:28:02.033 --> 00:28:05.067
is helping it out. 

00:28:05.067 --> 00:28:08.167
So one of these just called
synperiplanar. 

00:28:08.167 --> 00:28:11.967
It's flat, periplanar, but
adjacent to one another. 

00:28:11.967 --> 00:28:13.200
And the other is anti
periplanar. 

00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:18.400
OK, there's one more peak there,
and I don't know what 

00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:19.467
that is that went away. 

00:28:19.467 --> 00:28:23.033
It might be a combination of
some other freak transitions. 

00:28:23.033 --> 00:28:25.067
That's something we don't want
to talk about now, it's too 

00:28:25.067 --> 00:28:26.233
complicated. 

00:28:26.233 --> 00:28:29.700
But anyhow, here's a picture of
these vibrations. 

00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:32.967
We're in-phase, where that's the
low frequency, both 

00:28:32.967 --> 00:28:34.733
stretching at the same time. 

00:28:34.733 --> 00:28:40.767
But mostly the C=C, the C=C is
stretching nine times as much 

00:28:40.767 --> 00:28:42.600
as the C=O. 

00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:45.267
But here's the actual amplitude.

00:28:45.267 --> 00:28:49.033
The actual amplitudes are very
subtle for these things. 

00:28:49.033 --> 00:28:52.367
And in fact, we talked about
this a little bit last 

00:28:52.367 --> 00:28:55.800
semester, about how, when we
were doing quantum mechanics 

00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:58.533
and vibration, how much things
actually move. 

00:28:58.533 --> 00:29:03.233
And here's the out-of-phase
normal mode, mostly the C=O 

00:29:03.233 --> 00:29:07.667
vibration, a little bit of C=C.
And as one stretches the 

00:29:07.667 --> 00:29:08.900
other shrinks. 

00:29:11.667 --> 00:29:15.767
So the C=O is moving six times
as much as the C=C, and the 

00:29:15.767 --> 00:29:17.400
actual amplitude is like that. 

00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:20.533
And if you look at Lecture 8
last semester, you can 

00:29:20.533 --> 00:29:24.267
see where we talked about how
vibrational amplitudes are. 

00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:35.167
Here we were talking about two
things: identifying functional 

00:29:35.167 --> 00:29:38.600
groups, characteristic peaks,
strong peaks that you can 

00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:41.067
identify with particular
functional groups, and you can 

00:29:41.067 --> 00:29:43.633
look them up in tables, as I
suspect you did in lab 

00:29:43.633 --> 00:29:45.300
already, to see what functional

00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:47.300
group would come where. 

00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:49.167
And that's very valuable. 

00:29:49.167 --> 00:29:52.533
We used it here more to
understand how strong bonds 

00:29:52.533 --> 00:29:54.867
are, and resonance and so on. 

00:29:54.867 --> 00:29:58.667
In the real world, it can enter
in a lot of cases. 

00:29:58.667 --> 00:30:01.367
One interesting case is a
multibillion dollar 

00:30:01.367 --> 00:30:04.767
pharmaceutical, which
crystallizes in different 

00:30:04.767 --> 00:30:10.733
crystal forms, and those forms
are separately patented. 

00:30:10.733 --> 00:30:12.600
The drug is called Paxil. 

00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:20.500
These are taken from the patent
for that compound, 

00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:22.633
paroxetine hydrochloride. 

00:30:22.633 --> 00:30:27.900
This is the anhydrate, in called
Form A, or Polymorph A. 

00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:32.900
Polymorph means different
shapes, different crystals. 

00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:34.467
Now, what do we see in this
spectrum? 

00:30:34.467 --> 00:30:39.033
We see C-H stretching peaks over
at the left, and we see 

00:30:39.033 --> 00:30:41.467
fingerprint regions on the
right. 

00:30:41.467 --> 00:30:45.833
All these complicated
combinations of things. 

00:30:45.833 --> 00:30:48.100
But is there anything we can
identify? 

00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:52.800
Well, here, this sort of big
shoulder in here, turns out to 

00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:57.800
be characteristic of ammonium
ions, NH+-. 

00:30:57.800 --> 00:31:01.700
So we know it's an ammonium salt
from that. 

00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:05.467
Now, what are these peaks at
really high frequency? 

00:31:05.467 --> 00:31:07.567
They're much higher. 

00:31:07.567 --> 00:31:11.967
Those that are hydrogens on a
double bond, sp2, are 

00:31:11.967 --> 00:31:15.833
indeed higher frequency than
hydrogens on a single bond,

00:31:15.833 --> 00:31:20.167
sp3, but they're not as
high as this.

00:31:20.167 --> 00:31:24.700
And what those turn out to be
due to is water. 

00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:28.167
And notice than when water is
hydrogen bonded like this, you 

00:31:28.167 --> 00:31:32.200
have OH's that are at the end of
the chain, that have a very 

00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:35.667
high frequency, and OH's that
are involved in hydrogen 

00:31:35.667 --> 00:31:39.300
bonding, which are lower
frequency, because they don't 

00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:40.400
just go one way. 

00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:43.500
It's not so bad to move toward
the other oxygen. 

00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:47.400
OK, so we see two peaks here,
which is interesting because 

00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:52.100
this molecule is called an
anhydrate, but, in fact, it 

00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:53.533
has water in it. 

00:31:53.533 --> 00:31:56.600
So that was sort of a weird
thing about it. 

00:31:56.600 --> 00:31:59.767
OK, so here's the second form,
Form B. And 

00:31:59.767 --> 00:32:02.167
again, it has ammonium. 

00:32:02.167 --> 00:32:04.700
There's ammonium functionality
in there, C-H and 

00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:05.900
fingerprints. 

00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:09.833
And here's the third form, same
deal. 

00:32:09.833 --> 00:32:13.800
Now, notice incidentally, that
they had a lot of sample in 

00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:17.033
this one, so a lot of it had
zero transmittance. 

00:32:17.033 --> 00:32:21.833
Those C-H peaks didn't go all
the way, weren't sharp at the 

00:32:21.833 --> 00:32:23.567
bottom, because they just got
cut off. 

00:32:23.567 --> 00:32:26.100
No light got through the sample.

00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:28.300
OK, now if we look at the
fingerprint region, there's 

00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:37.867
Form C, there's Form A, and
here's Form B. Now, what you 

00:32:37.867 --> 00:32:42.500
look for, if you're going to
dispute a patent, is the guy 

00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:48.100
who's violating your patent,
making your compound? 

00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:51.700
So you try to find peaks in here
that are characteristic 

00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:54.667
of your compound, and see
whether there's some of that 

00:32:54.667 --> 00:32:58.233
in what the other guy's trying
to sell. 

00:32:58.233 --> 00:33:00.967
So you look around here and try
to figure out where in 

00:33:00.967 --> 00:33:03.967
this forest of things can we
find a peak, even if we have 

00:33:03.967 --> 00:33:07.600
no idea what the normal mode is,
that we'll be able to 

00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:08.933
distinguish. 

00:33:08.933 --> 00:33:12.300
And it turns out that those
peaks listed below there in 

00:33:12.300 --> 00:33:16.567
green, blue, and red are ones
that occur in the 

00:33:16.567 --> 00:33:19.133
corresponding form and not in
the others. 

00:33:19.133 --> 00:33:24.633
And in particular, those peaks
there, the 665 and the 675 are 

00:33:24.633 --> 00:33:28.200
very good for distinguishing B
and A, right? 

00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:31.100
So there was a patent dispute
that involved, can one 

00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:37.100
detect 5% of the B, the 675, in
the presence of 95% of the 

00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:38.000
unprotected one? 

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:41.300
In which case, they would be
violating the patent on B, if 

00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:43.067
there were 5% of it there. 

00:33:43.067 --> 00:33:49.567
So this is the legal world and
IR being involved in it. 

00:33:49.567 --> 00:33:52.667
So we've seen here spectroscopy
used both for 

00:33:52.667 --> 00:33:55.367
structure but also for dynamics,

00:33:55.367 --> 00:33:58.300
how things are moving. 

00:33:58.300 --> 00:34:02.033
And we saw it first in
electronic spectra, where we 

00:34:02.033 --> 00:34:05.667
saw the electrons sloshing up
and down at a rate that had to 

00:34:05.667 --> 00:34:08.567
do with the difference in energy
of the two orbitals 

00:34:08.567 --> 00:34:09.667
that are involved. 

00:34:09.667 --> 00:34:12.767
We've just seen vibrational, and
we're going on to nuclear 

00:34:12.767 --> 00:34:15.867
magnetic resonance, which is at
a much lower frequency, 

00:34:15.867 --> 00:34:19.833
radio frequencies, and involves
magnetism which we 

00:34:19.833 --> 00:34:22.767
haven't discussed yet. 

00:34:22.767 --> 00:34:25.000
And it involves precession,
which we 

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.400
haven't discussed yet. 

00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:31.600
But there are problems on the
Chem 125 web page that will 

00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:34.933
help you understand what's
involved in precession. 

00:34:34.933 --> 00:34:38.300
Now, here's a young Michael
Faraday, we showed this 

00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:41.600
picture last year, and he was a
chemist, remember? 

00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:44.500
And he discovered benzene in
illuminating gas. 

00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:46.333
We talked about that last
semester. 

00:34:46.333 --> 00:34:48.300
But that's not all he
discovered. 

00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:52.000
He also discovered magnetic
induction, and he invented the 

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:55.567
idea of magnetic and electric
fields. 

00:34:55.567 --> 00:34:57.700
He thought they were real, that
there were real little 

00:34:57.700 --> 00:35:00.467
filaments there for these lines
of force. 

00:35:00.467 --> 00:35:03.800
And the idea that you can get
magnetism from electric 

00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:07.267
current and electricity from
changing magnetism. 

00:35:07.267 --> 00:35:10.500
So that's generators and so on.

00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:12.700
If you're interested in seeing
things about that, here's a 

00:35:12.700 --> 00:35:16.233
website at Florida State
University Magnet Lab, that 

00:35:16.233 --> 00:35:18.800
tells you things about Faraday
and that. 

00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:22.600
And 30 years later then,
Maxwell, who knew math, which 

00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:26.633
Faraday didn't, built these into
the comprehensive theory 

00:35:26.633 --> 00:35:29.200
of light and electromagnetism. 

00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:31.700
Now, precession is involved, and
you've 

00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:33.300
seen precession before. 

00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:42.133
Here's a top, and remember the
amazing thing about this is 

00:35:42.133 --> 00:35:47.700
that if you put it on here it
doesn't fall down. 

00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:48.933
Whoops. 

00:35:50.833 --> 00:35:55.200
It stays standing up, and that's
an amazing thing. 

00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:57.933
If it's not spinning-- 

00:35:57.933 --> 00:36:00.467
let me slow it down just a bit.

00:36:00.467 --> 00:36:03.267
And now, that's precession, when
it goes around like this. 

00:36:03.267 --> 00:36:07.867
Remember how a top goes like
that, the axis goes like this. 

00:36:07.867 --> 00:36:11.267
And, of course, if it's not
spinning, gravity just makes 

00:36:11.267 --> 00:36:13.067
it fall down. 

00:36:13.067 --> 00:36:14.967
So why doesn't it fall down? 

00:36:14.967 --> 00:36:20.900
Why does it fall around rather
than falling down? 

00:36:20.900 --> 00:36:23.467
Now, you can see it better if we
use something bigger, so 

00:36:23.467 --> 00:36:25.167
we'll go to a bicycle wheel
here. 

00:36:28.167 --> 00:36:30.900
And I think I've got that on the
next slide. 

00:36:30.900 --> 00:36:34.033
OK, so we have a bicycle wheel
here. 

00:36:34.033 --> 00:36:36.333
I hang it up on this thing. 

00:36:36.333 --> 00:36:37.600
There we go. 

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:42.233
Whoa, get it hooked. 

00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:47.300
There we go. 

00:36:47.300 --> 00:36:48.900
Now, here I'm holding it up. 

00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:52.333
The strings pulling that way,
but its weight, if I let go, 

00:36:52.333 --> 00:36:53.467
is going to make it fall. 

00:36:53.467 --> 00:36:55.133
There's no big deal there. 

00:36:55.133 --> 00:36:57.267
And that shown. 

00:36:57.267 --> 00:37:00.967
The force down of gravity at the
red arrow and up on the 

00:37:00.967 --> 00:37:04.333
string puts a twist on it, which
makes it move right at 

00:37:04.333 --> 00:37:06.967
the top and left on the bottom.

00:37:06.967 --> 00:37:08.733
No big deal there. 

00:37:08.733 --> 00:37:11.700
But it's different, as you know,
if it's spinning. 

00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:13.333
So let me start spinning here. 

00:37:13.333 --> 00:37:19.467
[spins bike wheel] 

00:37:19.467 --> 00:37:21.133
And now when I let go-- 

00:37:21.133 --> 00:37:24.033
obviously, when I'm holding it
there's no torque on it-- but 

00:37:24.033 --> 00:37:27.533
if I let go, it falls around
rather than falling down. 

00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:35.067
Now, people talk about vectors
and right-hand rules... but why

00:37:35.067 --> 00:37:38.533
not a left-hand rule, I
wonder... and so on. 

00:37:38.533 --> 00:37:43.267
But it's something else to
really understand why this is 

00:37:43.267 --> 00:37:48.133
doing-- why there's precession
in a situation like this. 

00:37:48.133 --> 00:37:51.367
So normally it would just fall
down, but if it's spinning it 

00:37:51.367 --> 00:37:53.367
falls around. 

00:37:53.367 --> 00:37:57.067
And Feynman, in his lectures,
said something interesting 

00:37:57.067 --> 00:37:57.567
about this. 

00:37:57.567 --> 00:38:01.733
He said, many simple things can
be deduced mathematically 

00:38:01.733 --> 00:38:03.300
more rapidly. 

00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:05.400
They can be really understood in
a 

00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:07.400
fundamental or simple sense. 

00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:10.867
The precession of a top looks
like some kind of miracle 

00:38:10.867 --> 00:38:13.700
involving right angles and
circles, and twists and 

00:38:13.700 --> 00:38:15.233
right-hand screws. 

00:38:15.233 --> 00:38:17.533
What we should do is understand
it in a more 

00:38:17.533 --> 00:38:18.500
physical way. 

00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:21.933
Why does it move around instead
of falling down? 

00:38:21.933 --> 00:38:24.467
So that's what we're going to do
here. 

00:38:24.467 --> 00:38:28.333
And it turns out to have to do
with phase again, and the 

00:38:28.333 --> 00:38:31.200
difference between force and
velocity. 

00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:37.500
So let's think about this. 

00:38:37.500 --> 00:38:42.400
Let's take a point on the rim of
this. 

00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:49.700
And say... Notice that there's
going to be a torque from this 

00:38:49.700 --> 00:38:53.000
wanting to go down here and
being held up here. 

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:56.667
And that's transmitted through
the spokes to the rim. 

00:38:56.667 --> 00:39:01.833
So everything above the center
feels a force to your right, 

00:39:01.833 --> 00:39:04.367
and everything below the center
feels a force to your 

00:39:04.367 --> 00:39:05.867
left when I let go. 

00:39:05.867 --> 00:39:08.500
Everybody with me on that? 

00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:11.000
So let's take a point on the
rim. 

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:14.800
Here it feels no force at all,
because it's moving neither 

00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:16.400
right nor left. 

00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:20.633
As it goes up it gets more and
more force to the right. 

00:39:20.633 --> 00:39:22.167
Everybody with me? 

00:39:22.167 --> 00:39:24.467
Still more force to the right,
more force to the right. 

00:39:24.467 --> 00:39:28.333
Now less force to the right,
less zero, and now it feels a 

00:39:28.333 --> 00:39:32.933
force to the left as I let go. 

00:39:32.933 --> 00:39:35.633
So we can make a plot of the
force as a function of 

00:39:35.633 --> 00:39:38.133
position on the rim. 

00:39:38.133 --> 00:39:42.133
So if it's in the picture on the
screen here, when it's 

00:39:42.133 --> 00:39:46.233
above, the forces is to the
right: below, it's to the left.

00:39:46.233 --> 00:39:49.500
And this is what the force
should look like.

00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:52.267
When it's in the front or in the
back, there's no force. 

00:39:52.267 --> 00:39:56.333
When it's above, there's a force
to the right, and when 

00:39:56.333 --> 00:39:57.833
it's below, there's a force to
the left. 

00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:02.967
Now, I'm going to ask you a
different question. 

00:40:02.967 --> 00:40:09.233
Where is the velocity to the
right fastest? 

00:40:09.233 --> 00:40:12.700
Where's the force to the right
fastest-- 

00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:16.167
largest force at what position
on the rim?

00:40:16.167 --> 00:40:17.467
STUDENT: Top.

00:40:17.467 --> 00:40:19.300
PROFESSOR: At the top. 

00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:22.467
So it'll move the furthest, it
goes the fastest when

00:40:22.467 --> 00:40:22.833
I let go [clarification: for
non-rotating wheel]. 

00:40:22.833 --> 00:40:24.733
It goes much slower here. 

00:40:24.733 --> 00:40:26.933
OK, that's fine. 

00:40:26.933 --> 00:40:28.767
Now I'm asking a different
question. 

00:40:28.767 --> 00:40:34.100
Where is the velocity fastest to
the right? 

00:40:34.100 --> 00:40:36.067
Well, let's start here. 

00:40:36.067 --> 00:40:38.233
It's beginning to feel a little
bit of force to the 

00:40:38.233 --> 00:40:41.500
right. But if it's rotating,
it's still feeling 

00:40:41.500 --> 00:40:42.300
force to the right. 

00:40:42.300 --> 00:40:44.500
More and more, and more, and
more force to the right, more 

00:40:44.500 --> 00:40:45.500
force to the right. 

00:40:45.500 --> 00:40:47.367
Maximum force to the right. 

00:40:47.367 --> 00:40:50.200
And now less, and less, and
less, and less, and less, and

00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:52.533
less, and less, and less, until
it gets to zero.

00:40:52.533 --> 00:40:57.600
But all this time, during this
half rotation, that point that 

00:40:57.600 --> 00:41:00.933
I'm holding is feeling force to
the right, and 

00:41:00.933 --> 00:41:02.167
what does that mean? 

00:41:02.167 --> 00:41:05.100
It's accelerating to the right.

00:41:05.100 --> 00:41:06.933
Everybody with me on this? 

00:41:06.933 --> 00:41:11.267
So where is its velocity maximum
to the right? 

00:41:11.267 --> 00:41:13.267
STUDENT: Where force is minimum?

00:41:13.267 --> 00:41:15.333
PROFESSOR: Suppose I start
pushing 

00:41:15.333 --> 00:41:18.067
somebody on a bicycle, and I
keep pushing and pushing. 

00:41:18.067 --> 00:41:20.467
At the beginning I don't push
very hard, then I push real 

00:41:20.467 --> 00:41:22.400
hard, and then I don't push very
hard, and 

00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:23.733
finally I let go. 

00:41:23.733 --> 00:41:26.133
Where are they moving fastest,
assuming no 

00:41:26.133 --> 00:41:27.333
friction and so on? 

00:41:27.333 --> 00:41:27.633
Yigit? 

00:41:27.633 --> 00:41:28.500
STUDENT: At the very end. 

00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:29.333
PROFESSOR: At the very end. 

00:41:29.333 --> 00:41:31.767
All the time I'm pushing I'm
accelerating it. 

00:41:31.767 --> 00:41:35.867
So where is the velocity fastest
on this to the right? 

00:41:35.867 --> 00:41:37.300
Tell me when I get there? 

00:41:37.300 --> 00:41:38.100
STUDENT: Now. 

00:41:38.100 --> 00:41:39.033
PROFESSOR: There. 

00:41:39.033 --> 00:41:43.367
And that's exactly what it does
when it moves like this. 

00:41:43.367 --> 00:41:46.867
And then it's being slowed down,
because you're pushing 

00:41:46.867 --> 00:41:48.300
to the left. 

00:41:48.300 --> 00:41:52.067
And here it's got zero velocity,
you've cancelled it. 

00:41:52.067 --> 00:41:54.800
And now it starts moving to the
left and reaches its 

00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:57.567
maximum velocity to the left
here. 

00:41:57.567 --> 00:42:01.800
Then it starts slowing down
again and has zero velocity to 

00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:04.733
the left or right here, and then
it has its 

00:42:04.733 --> 00:42:07.300
maximum. So it moves like this.

00:42:07.300 --> 00:42:09.567
Isn't that neat? 

00:42:09.567 --> 00:42:14.100
So it's the difference between
force and velocity. 

00:42:14.100 --> 00:42:17.900
That velocity, you have to
integrate force over the time 

00:42:17.900 --> 00:42:18.767
that's involved. 

00:42:18.767 --> 00:42:22.667
So if you look at where is the
velocity maximum. 

00:42:22.667 --> 00:42:28.333
It's going to be 90 degrees
after the force is maximum. 

00:42:28.333 --> 00:42:30.667
So it's going to be the maximum
velocity 

00:42:30.667 --> 00:42:33.000
when it's in front. 

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:34.267
Velocity to the right. 

00:42:34.267 --> 00:42:37.800
And as it keeps going, it then
slows down. 

00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:40.533
And it has its maximum velocity
to left at the 

00:42:40.533 --> 00:42:41.767
bottom [correction: back], and
then it comes back up. 

00:42:41.767 --> 00:42:45.533
So there's this 90 degree phase
lag between the periodic 

00:42:45.533 --> 00:42:47.400
force and the velocity. 

00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:50.067
And that's why it falls around.

00:42:50.067 --> 00:42:52.767
So the velocities look like
that. 

00:42:52.767 --> 00:42:55.467
So there's a 90 degree phase
lag, and it falls around 

00:42:55.467 --> 00:42:56.867
rather than falling down. 

00:42:56.867 --> 00:43:00.300
Now, you've heard of nuclear
spin. 

00:43:00.300 --> 00:43:04.067
So these protons [correction:
nuclei], ones that have an odd

00:43:04.067 --> 00:43:11.567
atomic weight, either an odd
number or an odd weight, we

00:43:11.567 --> 00:43:12.867
know that they spin. 

00:43:12.867 --> 00:43:15.667
And the reason we know that they
spin is that when they're 

00:43:15.667 --> 00:43:19.267
in a magnetic field they
precess. 

00:43:19.267 --> 00:43:21.200
And how do we know that
they're-- 

00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:23.500
when you put the force on them.

00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:26.267
Obviously, if there's no force,
this doesn't precess, 

00:43:26.267 --> 00:43:28.333
it's when you try to twist it. 

00:43:28.333 --> 00:43:33.100
So if this is a magnet that's
spinning, and you put it in a 

00:43:33.100 --> 00:43:37.000
magnetic field that tries to
twist it, then it goes around 

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:39.067
and precesses. 

00:43:39.067 --> 00:43:43.033
So that's how you know that
these nuclei are magnetic. 

00:43:43.033 --> 00:43:45.333
Hydrogen fluorine and
phosphorous, those are the 

00:43:45.333 --> 00:43:48.200
common isotopes, but for carbon
and oxygen they're 

00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:50.200
uncommon isotopes. 

00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:56.833
And this is how fast they
precess in a magnetic field. 

00:43:56.833 --> 00:44:01.300
They precess like this, and you
can measure the frequency 

00:44:01.300 --> 00:44:03.233
of their going around and
around, and we'll mention that 

00:44:03.233 --> 00:44:04.167
in just a second. 

00:44:04.167 --> 00:44:07.400
And if a field happens to be
23.5 kilogauss, which is 

00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:11.167
not an uncommon field, then
protons go around the fastest, 

00:44:11.167 --> 00:44:14.633
100 million times a second. 

00:44:14.633 --> 00:44:17.600
Fluorine is almost as fast, but
phosphorous, carbon, 

00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:21.367
oxygen are less fast. So that,
just to give you-- 

00:44:21.367 --> 00:44:26.067
Connecticut Public Radio
broadcasts at 90.5 MHz, 

00:44:26.067 --> 00:44:32.200
and WCBS is at 0.88 MHz, 880
kHz. 

00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:33.800
So these are radio frequencies.

00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:37.800
Now, the electron also spins,
but it's way off scale up at 

00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:40.700
the top, 66,000 MHz. 

00:44:40.700 --> 00:44:46.100
It's a much more powerful magnet
than the nuclei. 

00:44:46.100 --> 00:44:49.867
OK, so a megahertz multiplied by
3 and times 10-5th 

00:44:49.867 --> 00:44:51.467
is wave numbers. 

00:44:51.467 --> 00:44:55.000
Remember, in IR we talked about
frequencies in wave 

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:57.967
numbers, how many waves in a
centimeter. 

00:44:57.967 --> 00:45:02.167
But the radio frequencies are
very, very, very 

00:45:02.167 --> 00:45:04.767
slow compared to that. 

00:45:04.767 --> 00:45:07.933
10-5th slower. 

00:45:07.933 --> 00:45:11.833
You can also talk about it in K
degrees. 

00:45:11.833 --> 00:45:15.700
And 100 MHz then, where the
proton resonates in this 

00:45:15.700 --> 00:45:20.033
frequency, is equivalent to 0.01
k. 

00:45:20.033 --> 00:45:24.700
And it's quantized, so that the
direction of the magnetic 

00:45:24.700 --> 00:45:29.633
field is either more or less
with the applied field, or 

00:45:29.633 --> 00:45:32.100
more or less against the applied
field. 

00:45:32.100 --> 00:45:33.767
But it's not like a compass. 

00:45:33.767 --> 00:45:36.533
It's not like you can have any
angle and different energies 

00:45:36.533 --> 00:45:37.267
for each angle. 

00:45:37.267 --> 00:45:39.100
It can either have this or that.

00:45:39.100 --> 00:45:41.267
That's quantization of spin. 

00:45:41.267 --> 00:45:44.000
Actually, quantum mechanics is
much easier to do with spin, 

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:47.167
because you can only have two
values, where for position or 

00:45:47.167 --> 00:45:49.300
energy, you could, in principal,
have any value. 

00:45:54.133 --> 00:46:02.467
The equilibrium ratio of the up
to down is 1.0003. 

00:46:02.467 --> 00:46:10.833
So that means that if you have
200,000 nuclei, there are 

00:46:10.833 --> 00:46:14.800
three more pointing up in the
favorable direction than 

00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:15.867
pointing down. 

00:46:15.867 --> 00:46:19.867
It's really, really wimpy, the
Boltzmann factor, the energy 

00:46:19.867 --> 00:46:23.167
difference between those. 

00:46:23.167 --> 00:46:28.500
And O-17 occurs at 6% in natural
abundance and C-13 at 

00:46:28.500 --> 00:46:33.433
1%, but these others, like
protons, are 99.98%, and only 

00:46:33.433 --> 00:46:35.967
0.02% deuterium. 

00:46:35.967 --> 00:46:41.833
OK, now, this is a really neat
concept, the rotating frame. 

00:46:41.833 --> 00:46:44.633
And let me do this and then I'll
let you go, because it's 

00:46:44.633 --> 00:46:46.867
a holiday coming up. 

00:46:46.867 --> 00:46:50.300
So there's the applied magnetic
field, and remember 

00:46:50.300 --> 00:46:54.767
we said that the nuclear field,
the axis about which 

00:46:54.767 --> 00:46:58.000
it's spinning, can either be
more or less up, or more or 

00:46:58.000 --> 00:46:59.667
less down but at a particular
angle. 

00:46:59.667 --> 00:47:01.933
So suppose it's like that. 

00:47:01.933 --> 00:47:04.567
And it precesses because it's
spinning. 

00:47:04.567 --> 00:47:06.967
And the rate of precession in
that field we just talked 

00:47:06.967 --> 00:47:12.000
about is 100 MHz, that's how
fast it goes around. 

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:15.767
So notice that that precessing
proton has a 

00:47:15.767 --> 00:47:18.267
constant vertical field. 

00:47:18.267 --> 00:47:19.900
That doesn't change as it
precesses, 

00:47:19.900 --> 00:47:21.233
the vertical component. 

00:47:21.233 --> 00:47:26.267
But the horizontal component
goes around like that. 

00:47:26.267 --> 00:47:29.367
And that looks neat, because if
that's going around at 100 

00:47:29.367 --> 00:47:33.967
MHz, that's going to be like an
antenna, and it'll 

00:47:33.967 --> 00:47:35.867
generate light that's coming
out. 

00:47:35.867 --> 00:47:39.233
It's like the vibration of C=O,
charge 

00:47:39.233 --> 00:47:40.567
going back and forth. 

00:47:40.567 --> 00:47:42.567
You see it going back and forth
as it is like that. 

00:47:42.567 --> 00:47:45.500
So it looks like we might be
able to detect that 

00:47:45.500 --> 00:47:47.900
broadcasting. 

00:47:47.900 --> 00:47:50.100
So will it generate a 100 MHz 

00:47:50.100 --> 00:47:51.633
radio frequency signal? 

00:47:51.633 --> 00:47:52.867
No. 

00:47:52.867 --> 00:47:55.700
It would if you just had one
proton. 

00:47:55.700 --> 00:47:58.167
But of course you have a mole of
protons, or at least a 

00:47:58.167 --> 00:48:01.267
millimole or something of
protons. 

00:48:01.267 --> 00:48:03.933
And so some we'll be here, some
will be here, some will 

00:48:03.933 --> 00:48:06.067
be here, some will be here, some
will be here. 

00:48:06.067 --> 00:48:08.000
And if you look at the
horizontal component-- 

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:11.133
although the vertical components
all add-- 

00:48:11.133 --> 00:48:16.133
the horizontal components that
are changing in time cancel. 

00:48:16.133 --> 00:48:17.367
Everybody see that? 

00:48:17.367 --> 00:48:21.033
So you don't get any net signal
coming out. 

00:48:21.033 --> 00:48:26.800
So the horizontal fields cancel,
but there's a trick 

00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:28.400
that allows you to do it. 

00:48:28.400 --> 00:48:32.467
And that is, suppose that
instead of us sitting here and 

00:48:32.467 --> 00:48:36.000
watching them precess, suppose
we orbit 

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:39.333
around them at 100 MHz. 

00:48:39.333 --> 00:48:42.633
We would certainly get dizzy if
we went around them at a 

00:48:42.633 --> 00:48:43.533
100 MHz. 

00:48:43.533 --> 00:48:47.367
But what would a proton look
like if we were going around 

00:48:47.367 --> 00:48:49.933
it at 100 MHz? 

00:48:49.933 --> 00:48:53.133
And it's going around at 100
MHz? 

00:48:53.133 --> 00:48:55.433
It would look like it's standing
still. 

00:48:55.433 --> 00:48:59.100
So that makes it much easier to
solve the problems, to work 

00:48:59.100 --> 00:49:02.267
in a rotating frame so that
they're not moving around from 

00:49:02.267 --> 00:49:03.867
our point of view at 100 MHz. 

00:49:03.867 --> 00:49:05.333
They're just standing still. 

00:49:05.333 --> 00:49:10.000
So we look at these and they're
just standing still, 

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:13.233
as if there were no applied
field. 

00:49:13.233 --> 00:49:17.900
Now we take a very weak magnetic
field that we 

00:49:17.900 --> 00:49:22.000
generate, a radio frequency
field, that's horizontal. 

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:25.533
In our frame it's horizontal,
pointing out that way. 

00:49:25.533 --> 00:49:29.767
Now, of course, in truth, it's
going around at 100 MHz. 

00:49:29.767 --> 00:49:32.800
But from our point of view, it's
just sitting there. 

00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:35.633
And from our point of view,
there is no applied field, 

00:49:35.633 --> 00:49:38.433
because our going around
canceled that. 

00:49:38.433 --> 00:49:42.767
So what will those protons do as
we look at them? 

00:49:42.767 --> 00:49:46.900
They'll precess around that
field. 

00:49:46.900 --> 00:49:48.667
See what I'm saying? 

00:49:48.667 --> 00:49:51.167
From our point of view they'll
just be this one weak little 

00:49:51.167 --> 00:49:56.100
magnetic field, and it'll appear
in a constant position 

00:49:56.100 --> 00:50:00.033
relative to us, because we're
whipping around so fast. And 

00:50:00.033 --> 00:50:03.733
so these things will precess
around that. 

00:50:03.733 --> 00:50:06.300
But they now they make all
different angles, because 

00:50:06.300 --> 00:50:08.267
they're quantized with respect
to that one. 

00:50:08.267 --> 00:50:10.233
They're quantized with respect
to the vertical field. 

00:50:10.233 --> 00:50:11.700
So they'll precess like that. 

00:50:11.700 --> 00:50:14.200
That particular one would go,
and all the others would go 

00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:15.933
precessing at the same rate. 

00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:22.567
So that's about 0.1 MHz rather
than 100 MHz, so 

00:50:22.567 --> 00:50:26.633
this is 1000 times weaker field.

00:50:26.633 --> 00:50:28.100
But how long do we do it? 

00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:31.000
How long do we put this field
on? 

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:37.900
Just long enough to make them go
90 degrees, like that. 

00:50:37.900 --> 00:50:42.767
So now they're pointing out
toward us like this. 

00:50:42.767 --> 00:50:45.100
But, in truth, they're not
statically 

00:50:45.100 --> 00:50:46.167
pointing out toward us. 

00:50:46.167 --> 00:50:49.033
They're going around at 100 MHz,
because we're going 

00:50:49.033 --> 00:50:51.300
around at 100 MHz. 

00:50:51.300 --> 00:50:57.200
And now there's a net field
that's oscillating in time, if 

00:50:57.200 --> 00:51:01.600
we go back and take ourselves
back to the laboratory, and 

00:51:01.600 --> 00:51:04.133
not spin around like that or
orbit like that. 

00:51:04.133 --> 00:51:07.000
We see this whole set going
around like that. 

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:11.133
So if we put in this thing
called a 90 degree pulse, now 

00:51:11.133 --> 00:51:14.100
we can hear these things
broadcasting. 

00:51:14.100 --> 00:51:16.267
And what will they tell us? 

00:51:16.267 --> 00:51:19.500
They'll tell us how strong the
torque is. 

00:51:19.500 --> 00:51:21.567
I didn't do that here, but let
me do it. 

00:51:21.567 --> 00:51:27.400
[spins bike wheel] 

00:51:27.400 --> 00:51:30.300
Now, if this is a magnet, I can
twist it by putting a 

00:51:30.300 --> 00:51:33.400
magnet field perpendicular to
it. 

00:51:33.400 --> 00:51:39.267
Now, suppose I made the field
that's perpendicular stronger, 

00:51:39.267 --> 00:51:40.867
to twist it harder. 

00:51:40.867 --> 00:51:43.300
So that's how fast it's
precessing. 

00:51:43.300 --> 00:51:48.267
What happens if I put this
wrench on? 

00:51:48.267 --> 00:51:51.300
Is it going to go faster or
slower, if I hang it on here? 

00:51:55.367 --> 00:51:57.600
Faster or slower? 

00:51:57.600 --> 00:51:59.100
Let me speed it up again here. 

00:51:59.100 --> 00:52:00.900
[spins bike wheel] 

00:52:00.900 --> 00:52:02.867
Incidentally, that's another
question. 

00:52:02.867 --> 00:52:07.333
If I go faster, if I make it
spin faster, will it precess 

00:52:07.333 --> 00:52:08.567
faster or slower? 

00:52:11.233 --> 00:52:13.500
It precesses only because it's
spinning. 

00:52:13.500 --> 00:52:15.400
If it weren't spinning it
wouldn't precess. 

00:52:15.400 --> 00:52:20.967
So suppose I spin faster, does
it go faster or slower? 

00:52:20.967 --> 00:52:21.333
Faster? 

00:52:21.333 --> 00:52:23.800
It should go faster? 

00:52:23.800 --> 00:52:27.433
No, because the amount of time
that's involved going here, 

00:52:27.433 --> 00:52:29.967
that we're pushing is shorter if
it's spinning faster. 

00:52:29.967 --> 00:52:31.333
So in fact, it goes slower. 

00:52:31.333 --> 00:52:32.133
Isn't that neat? 

00:52:32.133 --> 00:52:37.200
And now if I twist harder, it
goes faster. 

00:52:37.200 --> 00:52:39.000
See how it's going faster now? 

00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:40.867
And then it slows down if I take
that off? 

00:52:43.733 --> 00:52:46.467
It's not an ideal demonstration,
I grant you. 

00:52:51.500 --> 00:52:54.933
In fact, it goes slower if you--

00:52:54.933 --> 00:52:58.000
pardon me, it goes faster if you
put more torque on and 

00:52:58.000 --> 00:52:59.800
it's spinning at the same rate.

00:52:59.800 --> 00:53:03.067
So that's what these problems
are, for you to think about. 

00:53:03.067 --> 00:53:07.267
So I'll just finish in a second
here. 

00:53:07.267 --> 00:53:09.867
So we went into the rotating
frame long enough to get into 

00:53:09.867 --> 00:53:13.333
90 degrees, and now we go back,
and now we see a signal 

00:53:13.333 --> 00:53:16.100
coming out at 100 MHz. 

00:53:16.100 --> 00:53:19.000
So that's how you do the NMR
experiment. 

00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:22.367
They don't like that, and that's
the signal you see. 

00:53:22.367 --> 00:53:26.267
So it's 100 MHz in the
laboratory frame. 

00:53:26.267 --> 00:53:30.900
Until they relax and go back to
where they started, then 

00:53:30.900 --> 00:53:33.000
the signal goes away. 

00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:36.100
So that's what we're going to
talk about some more. 

00:53:36.100 --> 00:53:37.367
Have a good break.

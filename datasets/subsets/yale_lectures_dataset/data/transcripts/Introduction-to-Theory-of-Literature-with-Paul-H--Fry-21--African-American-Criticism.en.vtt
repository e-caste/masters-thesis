00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:06.067
Prof: So I'm not sure
how long this lecture is going

00:00:06.067 --> 00:00:06.560
to be.
 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.520
We could be finished in ten
minutes,

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.753
though I doubt that,
and if we're not finished at

00:00:11.753 --> 00:00:15.393
the end of the fifty,
there are some things that I've

00:00:15.393 --> 00:00:18.984
reserved for the end of the
lecture that I definitely do

00:00:18.984 --> 00:00:20.290
want to get said.
 

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:23.393
I don't know if you've noticed
that there are times when the

00:00:23.393 --> 00:00:26.287
last point or two that I
appeared to have been preparing

00:00:26.287 --> 00:00:30.086
to make never get made,
but in this case I want to make

00:00:30.086 --> 00:00:34.440
sure that they are made so that
if I don't finish today,

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.740
or if I still have a point or
two to make,

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:40.502
I'll definitely be taking up
those points at the beginning of

00:00:40.502 --> 00:00:41.820
Thursday's lecture.
 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:42.865
All right.
 

00:00:42.865 --> 00:00:48.718
Now the African-American
tradition of literary production

00:00:48.718 --> 00:00:51.750
is rich and long standing.
 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.144
As Henry Louis Gates tells you,
the first really rather

00:00:56.144 --> 00:01:00.131
important poet in the tradition,
Phillis Wheatley,

00:01:00.131 --> 00:01:02.978
is an American colonial writer.
 

00:01:02.978 --> 00:01:07.846
The flourishing of the slave
narrative form begins in the

00:01:07.846 --> 00:01:12.028
eighteenth century,
continues into the nineteenth,

00:01:12.028 --> 00:01:16.111
the nineteenth century
witnesses extraordinary works of

00:01:16.111 --> 00:01:18.679
fiction,
and in the twentieth century,

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:21.938
of course most conspicuously in
the Harlem Renaissance,

00:01:21.938 --> 00:01:25.912
but throughout the century
there has been extraordinary

00:01:25.912 --> 00:01:28.929
work done in the
African-American literary

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:29.959
tradition.
 

00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:32.269
It's a very rich tradition--in
other words,

00:01:32.269 --> 00:01:37.214
somewhat in contrast with the
very rich but also very recent

00:01:37.214 --> 00:01:42.410
tradition of African-American
literary theory and criticism.

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:46.870
It's possible to argue that the
development of theory and

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:51.888
criticism in this tradition was
somewhat balked by a preliminary

00:01:51.888 --> 00:01:56.110
way in which it found itself at
odds with itself.

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.646
Black criticism and black
feminist criticism from the

00:02:00.646 --> 00:02:05.879
beginning saw that they didn't
have quite the same agenda.

00:02:05.879 --> 00:02:07.640
This is something that can
resonate,

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.990
perhaps, later in this lecture
when we move to other topics,

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:14.520
but in the meantime critics
like Barbara Christian,

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.651
Barbara Smith,
Hazel Carby,

00:02:17.651 --> 00:02:24.397
and Bell Hooks were in their
variety of ways working with

00:02:24.397 --> 00:02:29.681
emphases that other,
male African-American critics

00:02:29.681 --> 00:02:32.188
weren't quite comfortable with.
 

00:02:32.188 --> 00:02:35.709
So while work,
especially beginning in the

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:37.791
eighties,
proliferated,

00:02:37.791 --> 00:02:41.918
there was, as I say,
a kind of internal divide which

00:02:41.918 --> 00:02:46.449
has been a complex matter to
negotiate and which is,

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:50.400
I think, now largely sort
of--well,

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.139
détente has been
achieved,

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:56.241
and African-American literary
theory is moving forward

00:02:56.241 --> 00:02:59.568
unfettered any longer by these
concerns,

00:02:59.568 --> 00:03:03.150
or at least by any excess of
these concerns.

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.526
But in the meantime that may
partly account for a certain

00:03:07.526 --> 00:03:11.825
delay in the emergence of theory
and criticism given the

00:03:11.825 --> 00:03:15.968
long-standing richness of the
literary tradition.

00:03:15.968 --> 00:03:20.128
Now the role of Henry Louis
Gates in African-American

00:03:20.128 --> 00:03:22.316
criticism is,
it seems to me,

00:03:22.316 --> 00:03:25.763
exemplary, although there are
some rather harsh moments in

00:03:25.763 --> 00:03:29.488
this essay,
moments that I wish to take up,

00:03:29.488 --> 00:03:32.669
that would suggest an element
of--

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:38.530
what shall I say?--extremism or
overkill in Gates's thinking.

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:44.750
This is actually not at all the
persona that he has projected.

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:49.598
Indeed what's extraordinary
about Gates, whose

00:03:49.598 --> 00:03:56.062
administrative power and whose
abilities as a program builder

00:03:56.062 --> 00:03:58.110
are remarkable.
 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:00.949
After he left Yale to go to
Harvard,

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:04.628
he was able to gather to
Harvard Anthony Appiah,

00:04:04.628 --> 00:04:06.998
Cornel West,
and others who have since

00:04:06.998 --> 00:04:11.414
departed from Harvard,
but Gates is in a way an empire

00:04:11.414 --> 00:04:16.319
unto himself and he has been an
extraordinary figure.

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:18.345
The earliest work,
which is actually among the

00:04:18.345 --> 00:04:20.459
earliest work in
African-American criticism,

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:22.649
is what you've been reading for
today,

00:04:22.649 --> 00:04:25.639
and it established his
reputation together with--

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:32.209
not so much discovery of,
but authentication of--

00:04:32.209 --> 00:04:35.420
a manuscript by Harriet Wilson
which he published,

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:40.297
an important contribution to
our knowledge of

00:04:40.297 --> 00:04:45.730
nineteenth-century
African-American literature.

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:49.127
In any case,
what happened then was that

00:04:49.127 --> 00:04:52.440
Gates who by some miracle or
other--

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.791
he was a perfectly good writer
in the first place but gradually

00:04:55.791 --> 00:04:59.266
became a marvelous writer--
began writing for The New

00:04:59.266 --> 00:05:02.918
Yorker,
and during this phase of

00:05:02.918 --> 00:05:05.935
his career,
when among other things he

00:05:05.935 --> 00:05:09.083
produced a remarkable
autobiography about growing up

00:05:09.083 --> 00:05:14.083
in West Virginia,
during this phase Gates really

00:05:14.083 --> 00:05:21.490
became a spokesperson for a
détente among races

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:24.329
and racial factions.
 

00:05:24.329 --> 00:05:27.819
In other words,
he was a voice of moderation

00:05:27.819 --> 00:05:32.934
without incurring any imputation
of Uncle Tom-ism or anything of

00:05:32.934 --> 00:05:33.990
the sort.
 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:38.978
His sheer urbanity as the
remarkable writer that he is in

00:05:38.978 --> 00:05:44.589
those years when he wrote under
Tina Brown for The New Yorker

00:05:44.589 --> 00:05:48.420
was just a remarkable
achievement,

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:53.300
and his career is still going
strong.

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:57.773
Now for Gates,
as for Elaine Showalter last

00:05:57.773 --> 00:06:03.951
week and for Woolf before her,
the problems surrounding the

00:06:03.951 --> 00:06:07.360
concept of identity persist.
 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:13.093
Identity--which of course is an
important anchor for the

00:06:13.093 --> 00:06:18.410
thinking of people who feel the
need for voices,

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:23.259
for a place in the literary and
cultural horizon--

00:06:23.259 --> 00:06:26.259
is nevertheless at least
potentially,

00:06:26.259 --> 00:06:31.189
as we've begun to notice
already, a kind of quicksand.

00:06:31.189 --> 00:06:37.889
There are two problems really
that dog the issue of identity.

00:06:37.889 --> 00:06:40.252
One of them is the problem of
"essentializing"

00:06:40.252 --> 00:06:43.084
which I'll take up now,
and then, as I'll take it up

00:06:43.084 --> 00:06:46.637
next, also the problem of what
might be called the identity

00:06:46.637 --> 00:06:47.190
queue.
 

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:52.649
In other words,
I am a lower-class black

00:06:52.649 --> 00:06:58.949
lesbian feminist whose nation is
Palestine.

00:06:58.949 --> 00:07:02.213
Needless to say,
I have a variety of identity

00:07:02.213 --> 00:07:06.072
options to choose from,
but the result is I've got to

00:07:06.072 --> 00:07:09.189
figure out which of them has
priority.

00:07:09.189 --> 00:07:14.307
In other words,
which of those identities do I

00:07:14.307 --> 00:07:20.220
suppose has the underlying
integrity and essence,

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:24.310
essentiality,
that can motivate,

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:29.050
as it were, the characteristics
of my other identities,

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:32.800
which are therefore somehow or
another placed further down in

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:33.550
the queue?
 

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:37.819
So this is a topic that I'll
come back to in a minute,

00:07:37.819 --> 00:07:41.379
but in the meantime the problem
of essentializing,

00:07:41.379 --> 00:07:44.516
as we call it:
for example,

00:07:44.516 --> 00:07:52.120
as Gates describes it on page
1893 in the right-hand column,

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:57.139
where he's very clear on the
dangers of ascribing,

00:07:57.139 --> 00:08:02.451
whether positively or
negatively, attributes to any

00:08:02.451 --> 00:08:07.338
group that is constituted as or
thought of--

00:08:07.338 --> 00:08:10.173
because of course,
the notion of race and whether

00:08:10.173 --> 00:08:13.185
there is race is in
itself according to Gates

00:08:13.185 --> 00:08:16.951
problematic--
the problem of ascribing

00:08:16.951 --> 00:08:22.129
attributes even honorifically to
a race is,

00:08:22.129 --> 00:08:27.810
as he describes it on page
1893:

00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:32.998
The sense of difference defined
in popular usages [finally my

00:08:32.998 --> 00:08:36.889
voice is changing]
&gt;

00:08:36.889 --> 00:08:41.389
&gt;
 

00:08:41.389 --> 00:08:45.767
of the term race has
been used both to describe and

00:08:45.767 --> 00:08:49.070
inscribe differences of
language,

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:51.283
belief system,
artistic tradition,

00:08:51.283 --> 00:08:54.568
"gene pool,"
and all sorts of supposedly

00:08:54.568 --> 00:08:57.990
"natural"
attributes such as rhythm,

00:08:57.990 --> 00:09:00.676
athletic ability,
cerebration,

00:09:00.676 --> 00:09:03.028
usury,
and fidelity.

00:09:03.028 --> 00:09:06.058
In other words,
obviously, apportioning out

00:09:06.058 --> 00:09:10.169
stereotypes to the various
groups that may come forward as

00:09:10.169 --> 00:09:14.524
candidates to be races--
he's pointing out that all of

00:09:14.524 --> 00:09:18.070
these stereotypes do nobody very
much good.

00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:21.583
So the problem of
essentializing,

00:09:21.583 --> 00:09:27.952
which undergirds the wish to
make manifest the existence of

00:09:27.952 --> 00:09:30.259
race gives pause.
 

00:09:30.259 --> 00:09:31.080
Think about it.
 

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:34.484
On the other hand,
Gates seems to be divided at

00:09:34.484 --> 00:09:38.629
the beginning of his essay
between a certain candor about

00:09:38.629 --> 00:09:41.014
race,
as in the work of Hippolyte

00:09:41.014 --> 00:09:44.303
Taine that he describes,
in which "race,"

00:09:44.303 --> 00:09:47.517
"milieu"
and "cultural moment"

00:09:47.517 --> 00:09:50.927
are considered the key
determining issues of any kind

00:09:50.927 --> 00:09:53.548
of artistic or cultural
production.

00:09:53.548 --> 00:09:54.558
He says of that in effect,
"Well,

00:09:54.558 --> 00:09:58.008
at least race is being talked
about," while at the same

00:09:58.008 --> 00:10:01.515
time obviously wincing away from
the implications of race and

00:10:01.515 --> 00:10:04.788
from the belief that there is
such a thing as race,

00:10:04.788 --> 00:10:09.253
which goes all the way back to
Montesquieu and others from

00:10:09.253 --> 00:10:09.879
Taine.
 

00:10:09.879 --> 00:10:11.778
Nevertheless,
as I say, he's rather cheerful

00:10:11.778 --> 00:10:14.250
about the fact that at least
race is being discussed,

00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:18.278
unlike the twentieth century
when the whole thing is swept

00:10:18.278 --> 00:10:22.307
under the rug and a kind of
ersatz and hypocritical

00:10:22.307 --> 00:10:26.831
politeness prevents anybody from
talking about such categories at

00:10:26.831 --> 00:10:29.696
all,
and gives rise to the idea that

00:10:29.696 --> 00:10:32.590
we all exist in the same Great
Tradition,

00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:35.720
that work either belongs to
that tradition or,

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:38.596
if it for some reason seems
egregious or outside the

00:10:38.596 --> 00:10:41.677
tradition,
it just can be shoved aside and

00:10:41.677 --> 00:10:42.509
neglected.
 

00:10:42.509 --> 00:10:45.682
That's the supposition of the
twentieth century when folks

00:10:45.682 --> 00:10:47.019
don't talk about race.
 

00:10:47.019 --> 00:10:52.974
So the very question whether it
is an issue is part of this

00:10:52.974 --> 00:10:58.519
problem that is dogged by the
more complicated issue of

00:10:58.519 --> 00:11:00.470
essentializing.
 

00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:03.830
For example,
suppose--and of course,

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:07.509
you've been reading about this
in Showalter as well--

00:11:07.509 --> 00:11:12.809
you ascribe positive value to
what another person might call a

00:11:12.809 --> 00:11:13.940
stereotype.
 

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:19.697
This is what the important
Francophone African poet Senghor

00:11:19.697 --> 00:11:23.967
does, as Gates says at the top
of page 1901,

00:11:23.967 --> 00:11:26.549
the right hand-column.
 

00:11:26.549 --> 00:11:29.886
Gates says:
When we attempt to appropriate,

00:11:29.886 --> 00:11:33.581
by inversion,
race as a term for an

00:11:33.581 --> 00:11:37.009
essence,
as did the Negritude movement,

00:11:37.009 --> 00:11:40.852
for example ("We feel,
therefore we are,"

00:11:40.852 --> 00:11:43.158
as Senghor argued of the
African),

00:11:43.158 --> 00:11:47.307
we yield too much,
such as the basis of a shared

00:11:47.307 --> 00:11:48.279
humanity.
 

00:11:48.279 --> 00:11:51.777
Such gestures,
as Anthony Appiah has observed,

00:11:51.777 --> 00:11:55.506
are futile and dangerous
because of their further

00:11:55.506 --> 00:11:59.158
inscription of new and bizarre
stereotypes.

00:11:59.158 --> 00:12:05.409
So you can see there are a lot
of landmines to be avoided in

00:12:05.409 --> 00:12:11.342
negotiating the discourse of
race, and certainly Gates is

00:12:11.342 --> 00:12:13.250
aware of them.
 

00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:15.769
Now there's also the problem,
as I say,

00:12:15.769 --> 00:12:19.448
of the identity queue,
and Gates himself may have a

00:12:19.448 --> 00:12:23.307
little difficulty with this,
at least from time to time,

00:12:23.307 --> 00:12:25.470
because as I said at the
beginning,

00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:29.797
he does have this sort of
uneasy détente

00:12:29.797 --> 00:12:33.471
with feminism in the
African-American critical

00:12:33.471 --> 00:12:36.330
tradition still to work within.
 

00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:39.288
So for example,
on page 1894,

00:12:39.288 --> 00:12:45.312
a somewhat problematic passage
in which the identity queue

00:12:45.312 --> 00:12:50.595
seems to be at issue,
about a third of the way down,

00:12:50.595 --> 00:12:53.298
the left-hand column,
he says:

00:12:53.298 --> 00:12:58.168
The sanction of biology
contained in sexual difference,

00:12:58.168 --> 00:13:02.269
simply put, does not and can
never obtain when one is

00:13:02.269 --> 00:13:05.740
speaking of "racial
difference."

00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:10.331
Yet we carelessly use language
in such a way as to will

00:13:10.331 --> 00:13:13.870
this sense of natural
difference into our

00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:15.149
formulations.
 

00:13:15.149 --> 00:13:17.948
So what he's saying is in
biological terms there's

00:13:17.948 --> 00:13:20.519
definitely a difference between
the sexes,

00:13:20.519 --> 00:13:26.238
but in biological terms there
is not necessarily a difference

00:13:26.238 --> 00:13:29.668
among the so-called primary
races.

00:13:29.668 --> 00:13:35.677
The result is that at least
when one speaks of women and men

00:13:35.677 --> 00:13:41.236
in the feminist tradition,
one has to come face to face

00:13:41.236 --> 00:13:44.870
with the problem of actual
difference;

00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:48.519
whereas when one speaks of
black and white in the

00:13:48.519 --> 00:13:53.158
traditions of discourse about
race, one isn't actually talking

00:13:53.158 --> 00:13:56.048
about a genuine difference at
all.

00:13:56.048 --> 00:14:01.743
Therefore the discourse with
the greater integrity of the two

00:14:01.743 --> 00:14:07.056
is the one which is about
differences that are absolutely

00:14:07.056 --> 00:14:10.308
ephemeral,
as opposed to the one which is

00:14:10.308 --> 00:14:12.813
about differences,
which, whatever one thinks of

00:14:12.813 --> 00:14:15.029
them and whatever one wants to
make out of them,

00:14:15.029 --> 00:14:18.250
are nevertheless essential.
 

00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:21.908
Now plainly when we go back to
feminist criticism,

00:14:21.908 --> 00:14:25.250
particularly the gender theory
of Judith Butler,

00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:29.450
we'll see of course that the
whole question of the biological

00:14:29.450 --> 00:14:32.975
basis of sex,
the biological difference

00:14:32.975 --> 00:14:37.977
between the sexes which
essentializes what we will be

00:14:37.977 --> 00:14:42.606
wanting to talk about,
is of course something that is

00:14:42.606 --> 00:14:46.277
profoundly in question,
and not just because of

00:14:46.277 --> 00:14:49.658
so-called trans-gender issues
but also,

00:14:49.658 --> 00:14:53.652
at the same time,
because of the way in which our

00:14:53.652 --> 00:14:57.230
very sexual identity is
something which,

00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:59.509
according to Butler,
we construct.

00:14:59.509 --> 00:15:05.091
So there is an insistence here
on a biological difference

00:15:05.091 --> 00:15:10.873
between these two forms of
discussing identity which may or

00:15:10.873 --> 00:15:14.960
may not seem to us to be
problematic.

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:19.206
Now I think this is the point
at which we can see the

00:15:19.206 --> 00:15:24.188
importance of the extraordinary
essay that I've also asked you

00:15:24.188 --> 00:15:26.639
to read, by Toni Morrison.
 

00:15:26.639 --> 00:15:29.988
We know her best,
of course, as a novelist,

00:15:29.988 --> 00:15:34.373
but she's also a distinguished
critic, as she has been a

00:15:34.373 --> 00:15:38.279
distinguished editor of other
important work.

00:15:38.279 --> 00:15:43.330
Here it seems to me that her
reflections in some ways give us

00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:47.789
a sideways exit from the
predicaments that I have been

00:15:47.789 --> 00:15:51.429
talking about,
the problem of essentialism and

00:15:51.429 --> 00:15:53.798
the problem of the identity
queue,

00:15:53.798 --> 00:15:57.019
because what Morrison wants to
say--

00:15:57.019 --> 00:16:01.577
and I think she borrows here
particularly from the famous

00:16:01.577 --> 00:16:05.648
discussion of the master-slave
dialectic in Hegel's

00:16:05.648 --> 00:16:10.918
Phenomenology of Mind--
what Morrison wants to say

00:16:10.918 --> 00:16:16.673
is that identity isn't so much a
question of what something is

00:16:16.673 --> 00:16:20.730
but rather a question of what it
is not.

00:16:20.730 --> 00:16:26.029
She says not that we should be
so much preoccupied with what it

00:16:26.029 --> 00:16:28.909
is to be black,
but rather that,

00:16:28.909 --> 00:16:33.770
as we think about the way in
which being black is inscribed

00:16:33.770 --> 00:16:38.388
within the white tradition--
as we think about that,

00:16:38.388 --> 00:16:42.511
we need to think about what
white is not:

00:16:42.511 --> 00:16:46.245
in other words,
as she says repeatedly,

00:16:46.245 --> 00:16:52.259
about black as absence,
as negation, as negativity.

00:16:52.259 --> 00:16:55.370
We have to understand the
absolute--

00:16:55.370 --> 00:16:59.041
and this is where she drives
her argument from the

00:16:59.041 --> 00:17:03.981
master-slave dialectic--
the absolute necessity in the

00:17:03.981 --> 00:17:09.038
construction of white identity
for there to be,

00:17:09.038 --> 00:17:15.858
as an absence and as a lack
over against white identity,

00:17:15.858 --> 00:17:20.480
the existence of the African
American and,

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:23.067
more particularly,
for the better part of the

00:17:23.067 --> 00:17:26.200
American cultural tradition,
of the slave.

00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:31.038
Let me quote then from her
essay on page 1795,

00:17:31.038 --> 00:17:35.338
the left-hand column,
where she says:

00:17:35.338 --> 00:17:41.844
In that construction of
blackness [this is a third of

00:17:41.844 --> 00:17:47.222
the way down]
and enslavement could be found

00:17:47.222 --> 00:17:55.230
not only the not-free but also
the projection of the not-me.

00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:58.380
The result was a playground for
the imagination.

00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:02.356
And what rose up out of
collective needs to allay

00:18:02.356 --> 00:18:07.163
internal fears and rationalize
external exploitation was an

00:18:07.163 --> 00:18:11.125
Africanism--
a fabricated brew of darkness,

00:18:11.125 --> 00:18:14.509
otherness,
alarm and desire--that is

00:18:14.509 --> 00:18:16.278
uniquely American.
 

00:18:16.278 --> 00:18:19.318
Then she points out that
although her subject is the

00:18:19.318 --> 00:18:22.486
American tradition,
there also exists a European

00:18:22.486 --> 00:18:26.730
Africanism with its counterpart
in its own colonial literature.

00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:30.280
To reinforce this,
she takes a remarkable example

00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:34.972
which must have reminded you,
those of you who know Faulkner,

00:18:34.972 --> 00:18:39.170
of Thomas Sutpen or at least
reminded you in some ways of

00:18:39.170 --> 00:18:42.625
Thomas Sutpen--
the example of this character

00:18:42.625 --> 00:18:44.974
Dunbar,
who actually rose up not so

00:18:44.974 --> 00:18:48.805
much out of the swamp as out of
the Scottish Enlightenment and

00:18:48.805 --> 00:18:52.682
came to the United States and--
according to Bernard Bailyn,

00:18:52.682 --> 00:18:55.920
the historian from whom she
cites her information--

00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:59.880
became a completely transformed
character.

00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:03.653
I won't quote to you the long
passage from Bailyn's text which

00:19:03.653 --> 00:19:06.808
makes what Morrison wants to
take from it clear,

00:19:06.808 --> 00:19:12.390
but rather from what Morrison
summarizes of it on page 1796,

00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:15.170
the top of the right-hand
column:

00:19:15.170 --> 00:19:20.242
I take this [William Dunbar]
to be a succinct portrait of

00:19:20.242 --> 00:19:23.867
the process by which the
American as new,

00:19:23.867 --> 00:19:27.130
white, and male was
constituted.

00:19:27.130 --> 00:19:31.509
It is a formation that has
several attractive consequences,

00:19:31.509 --> 00:19:35.398
all of which are referred to in
Bailyn's summation of Dunbar's

00:19:35.398 --> 00:19:38.778
character and located in how
Dunbar feels "within

00:19:38.778 --> 00:19:41.087
himself"--
"a power,

00:19:41.087 --> 00:19:45.009
a sense of freedom he had not
known before."

00:19:45.009 --> 00:19:49.443
This is uncannily parallel by
the way to the rationalization

00:19:49.443 --> 00:19:51.700
for slaves in Greek culture.
 

00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:55.970
The Greeks always said that the
reason they had slaves was so

00:19:55.970 --> 00:19:59.528
they could be free:
in other words so that the home

00:19:59.528 --> 00:20:03.229
or ruling population was
liberated in the case of the

00:20:03.229 --> 00:20:07.286
Greeks from performing the daily
necessities that are life

00:20:07.286 --> 00:20:09.920
sustaining and keep us going.
 

00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:12.953
In other words,
to be free according to the

00:20:12.953 --> 00:20:16.638
citizen of the Greek
polis is to be free from

00:20:16.638 --> 00:20:17.288
work.
 

00:20:17.288 --> 00:20:21.458
Now in a certain way,
this is still a rationalization

00:20:21.458 --> 00:20:26.750
that Tony Morrison sees in the
American slave-owning tradition,

00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:30.941
but it's not so much in the
case of this Dunbar a freedom

00:20:30.941 --> 00:20:31.838
from work.
 

00:20:31.838 --> 00:20:36.635
It's a more broad and insidious
idea of freedom:

00:20:36.635 --> 00:20:42.300
freedom from responsibility,
freedom from the need to

00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:48.044
acknowledge otherness as human--
freedom, in other words,

00:20:48.044 --> 00:20:53.804
from the sorts of constraint
imposed by old world civility in

00:20:53.804 --> 00:20:58.455
Scotland and in London;
freedom on this frontier,

00:20:58.455 --> 00:21:01.303
in this wilderness,
in this swamp,

00:21:01.303 --> 00:21:04.838
simply to be whatever one wants
to be.

00:21:04.838 --> 00:21:12.710
That freedom is achieved on the
backs of the black slaves.

00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:16.778
It is in some ways similar,
as I say,

00:21:16.778 --> 00:21:20.368
to the rationalization for
slavery in Greece,

00:21:20.368 --> 00:21:25.519
but it is in a way more
insidious and certainly more--

00:21:25.519 --> 00:21:28.890
in the terms that Morrison's
giving it to us in--

00:21:28.890 --> 00:21:30.200
more dialectical.
 

00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:34.914
That is to say,
it is the question of whether a

00:21:34.914 --> 00:21:40.452
person could become white
without the availability of a

00:21:40.452 --> 00:21:45.118
black absence,
of that which can be

00:21:45.118 --> 00:21:53.279
oppressed-- like a kind of
spring for the jack-in-the-box--

00:21:53.279 --> 00:21:56.996
which allows the white
jack-in-the-box to leap out of

00:21:56.996 --> 00:22:01.500
the box because of that which
has been suppressed down below.

00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:05.558
All of that is part of Toni
Morrison's concern,

00:22:05.558 --> 00:22:09.519
and it colors her,
well, certainly controversial

00:22:09.519 --> 00:22:12.720
reading of Huckleberry
Finn--

00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:14.670
which nevertheless,
it seems to me,

00:22:14.670 --> 00:22:18.328
has a quite profound interest.
 

00:22:18.328 --> 00:22:23.044
Now my own first instinct when
people single out Huckleberry

00:22:23.044 --> 00:22:27.453
Finn for blame is to
wince away, because it's an

00:22:27.453 --> 00:22:29.278
extraordinary novel.
 

00:22:29.278 --> 00:22:33.817
The controversy about it in the
school districts which made it a

00:22:33.817 --> 00:22:37.994
banished book had mainly to do
with the "N-word,"

00:22:37.994 --> 00:22:41.653
to which we'll return,
and the question of who has the

00:22:41.653 --> 00:22:43.586
right to use the
"N-word,"

00:22:43.586 --> 00:22:46.019
which is not an easy question
to answer,

00:22:46.019 --> 00:22:47.480
as we'll see.
 

00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:51.953
But that controversy,
while it had an authentic

00:22:51.953 --> 00:22:55.469
basis,
was nevertheless certainly in

00:22:55.469 --> 00:23:00.929
literary terms and in terms of
the imagination perhaps rather

00:23:00.929 --> 00:23:01.930
limited.
 

00:23:01.930 --> 00:23:06.596
Morrison gives rise to another
equally and intensely critical

00:23:06.596 --> 00:23:10.019
way of thinking about
Huckleberry Finn.

00:23:10.019 --> 00:23:14.328
She argues that to liberate
Jim--

00:23:14.328 --> 00:23:17.852
which of course is the
tremendous failure at the end of

00:23:17.852 --> 00:23:21.305
the novel,
a failure of imagination on the

00:23:21.305 --> 00:23:26.599
part of Tom Sawyer and a failure
of will or independence of mind

00:23:26.599 --> 00:23:30.692
on the part of Huck himself--
that the failure to liberate

00:23:30.692 --> 00:23:33.700
Jim, which would have been the
easiest thing in the world,

00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:37.708
because all they had to do was
point out the right fork in the

00:23:37.708 --> 00:23:41.499
river,
is an absolute necessity for

00:23:41.499 --> 00:23:48.584
the ongoing self-definition of
whiteness as it's available both

00:23:48.584 --> 00:23:53.468
to Tom and to Huck and,
after all, by implication,

00:23:53.468 --> 00:23:55.058
to Mark Twain himself.
 

00:23:55.058 --> 00:23:57.190
He couldn't figure out how to
end the novel.

00:23:57.190 --> 00:23:59.445
He wrote it,
then it lay on his desk for a

00:23:59.445 --> 00:24:02.473
long time because he just
couldn't figure out what to do

00:24:02.473 --> 00:24:05.057
with it,
and he finally comes up with

00:24:05.057 --> 00:24:08.730
this--as we all agree--
appalling ending.

00:24:08.730 --> 00:24:13.421
Toni Morrison says it's the
only ending available

00:24:13.421 --> 00:24:17.190
because in ways that the,
as she sees it,

00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:22.343
sentimentality of the novel and
the sentimentality of the

00:24:22.343 --> 00:24:25.838
relationship between Huck and
Jim,

00:24:25.838 --> 00:24:29.633
which is so strong that it
caused another critic named

00:24:29.633 --> 00:24:33.713
Leslie Fiedler to talk about a
homoerotic relation between

00:24:33.713 --> 00:24:36.077
them--
the title of Fiedler's famous

00:24:36.077 --> 00:24:38.180
essay is "Come Up on the
Raft,

00:24:38.180 --> 00:24:44.230
Huck, Honey"--with all of
that in the background,

00:24:44.230 --> 00:24:48.994
Toni Morrison says the basic
structure of consciousness in

00:24:48.994 --> 00:24:53.999
Twain's novel is obscured,
a basic structure which makes

00:24:53.999 --> 00:24:58.180
it absolutely imperative that
Jim not be free.

00:24:58.180 --> 00:25:02.736
If Jim is free,
then there is no Other over

00:25:02.736 --> 00:25:07.509
against which whiteness can
define itself.

00:25:07.509 --> 00:25:10.726
That's the way in which she
makes use of the general

00:25:10.726 --> 00:25:14.635
argument about the traditions of
American literature in culture

00:25:14.635 --> 00:25:17.599
in applying it to Huckleberry
Finn.

00:25:17.599 --> 00:25:18.368
All right.
 

00:25:18.368 --> 00:25:22.243
Let's go back to Skip
Gates--Henry Louis Gates's

00:25:22.243 --> 00:25:27.355
nickname, sorry--another person
who was at Yale and whom I knew

00:25:27.355 --> 00:25:28.509
very well.
 

00:25:28.509 --> 00:25:32.083
I actually had a little bit to
do with the origin of the notion

00:25:32.083 --> 00:25:35.430
of the signifying monkey;
I'll come back to that later.

00:25:35.430 --> 00:25:38.140
Barbara Johnson,
also now at Harvard,

00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:42.269
and I had a lot of
conversations with Skip at that

00:25:42.269 --> 00:25:46.040
period about this,
and so it's not that I feel

00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:49.396
proprietary--
it's Skip's idea--but I was in

00:25:49.396 --> 00:25:54.005
on that,
and so it's not just name

00:25:54.005 --> 00:25:55.538
dropping.
 

00:25:55.538 --> 00:25:58.308
I get to call him by what his
friends call him.

00:25:58.308 --> 00:26:03.634
However, I'll try to remember
to say Henry Louis Gates,

00:26:03.634 --> 00:26:07.480
and in any case to return to
him now.

00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:14.549
I want to talk a little bit
simply about his understanding

00:26:14.549 --> 00:26:21.249
and the understanding of others
of the African-American

00:26:21.249 --> 00:26:25.646
tradition--
both of the critical tradition

00:26:25.646 --> 00:26:28.269
and of the literary tradition.
 

00:26:28.269 --> 00:26:30.817
First of all,
the grasp of the critical

00:26:30.817 --> 00:26:34.573
tradition as basically a
two-step or two-part progression

00:26:34.573 --> 00:26:39.200
is something that he shares with
Elaine Showalter from last time.

00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:43.313
You remember Showalter says
that the important movement of

00:26:43.313 --> 00:26:47.281
feminist interventions in
literary criticism begins with

00:26:47.281 --> 00:26:50.602
the moment that she calls
"feminist":

00:26:50.602 --> 00:26:54.701
that is to say,
the moment of Kate Millett and

00:26:54.701 --> 00:27:00.058
other authors who talk about the
degradation and unfair treatment

00:27:00.058 --> 00:27:05.741
of women in male books,
and then what Showalter prefers

00:27:05.741 --> 00:27:11.703
and supposes to have supervened
and to have become more

00:27:11.703 --> 00:27:14.656
important,
"gynocritical

00:27:14.656 --> 00:27:18.255
criticism,"
which is women's appropriation

00:27:18.255 --> 00:27:21.538
of literary traditions for
themselves,

00:27:21.538 --> 00:27:26.757
the archival work that makes
the canon of women's literature

00:27:26.757 --> 00:27:31.180
not just leaping from great name
to great name,

00:27:31.180 --> 00:27:34.565
but an actual unfolding and
continuous development from

00:27:34.565 --> 00:27:37.920
decade to decade,
as Showalter puts it.

00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:41.636
Now Gates on page 1896,
the right-hand margin,

00:27:41.636 --> 00:27:45.768
sees it in much the same way
for the development of

00:27:45.768 --> 00:27:48.328
African-American criticism.
 

00:27:48.328 --> 00:27:50.509
You can do two things
basically, says Gates.

00:27:50.509 --> 00:27:52.738
He doesn't put them
chronologically,

00:27:52.738 --> 00:27:56.049
but you could map onto what
he's saying here the same

00:27:56.049 --> 00:27:57.769
chronological sequence.
 

00:27:57.769 --> 00:28:02.179
He says: What I mean by citing
these two overworked terms [he's

00:28:02.179 --> 00:28:05.663
talking about "the
other" in particular]

00:28:05.663 --> 00:28:08.721
is precisely this:
how blacks are figures in

00:28:08.721 --> 00:28:12.440
literature [that is to say,
how they're represented in

00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:14.855
literature,
demeaningly,

00:28:14.855 --> 00:28:20.269
even perhaps honorifically],
and also how blacks

00:28:20.269 --> 00:28:22.109
figure, as it
were,

00:28:22.109 --> 00:28:24.328
literature of their own making.
 

00:28:24.328 --> 00:28:26.032
[You can see,
in other words,

00:28:26.032 --> 00:28:29.500
the same movement in his
thinking about these issues.]

00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:32.329
As Showalter argued too,
the question of the

00:28:32.329 --> 00:28:35.490
literary tradition is
more complicated;

00:28:35.490 --> 00:28:36.960
it has more steps.
 

00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:40.428
In other words,
the powers of self-expression

00:28:40.428 --> 00:28:44.685
available to women from the
beginning of their creative

00:28:44.685 --> 00:28:49.180
expression passed through more
than just two stages,

00:28:49.180 --> 00:28:53.480
and the same thing is true of
African-American literature.

00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:58.141
Now I think that Gates simply
takes for granted as an implicit

00:28:58.141 --> 00:29:02.038
premise of the work that was
done the year before he

00:29:02.038 --> 00:29:05.784
published this essay in
Critical Inquiry by

00:29:05.784 --> 00:29:09.298
another colleague of ours here
at Yale--

00:29:09.298 --> 00:29:11.690
who died tragically not too
long thereafter--

00:29:11.690 --> 00:29:15.624
named Michael Cooke,
who in 1984 wrote a book called

00:29:15.624 --> 00:29:19.634
Afro-American Literature in
the Twentieth Century:

00:29:19.634 --> 00:29:22.490
The Achievement of
Intimacy.

00:29:22.490 --> 00:29:27.316
Cooke argued in this book that
the history of African-American

00:29:27.316 --> 00:29:31.430
literature passes essentially
through four stages.

00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:35.750
It begins with what Cooke calls
"self-veiling":

00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:37.964
the period,
in other words,

00:29:37.964 --> 00:29:42.279
in which people attempting for
the first time to write--

00:29:42.279 --> 00:29:46.450
and of course Gates talks about
the way in which writing is

00:29:46.450 --> 00:29:50.477
really writing oneself into the
human community for black

00:29:50.477 --> 00:29:53.595
people--
the people who first attempted

00:29:53.595 --> 00:29:55.700
to write used white models.
 

00:29:55.700 --> 00:29:58.178
Phillis Wheatley,
the poet whom Gates talks

00:29:58.178 --> 00:30:00.480
about,
a remarkable poet and a very

00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:03.445
interesting one,
nevertheless wrote in the

00:30:03.445 --> 00:30:07.343
manner of Alexander Pope,
so much so that a great deal of

00:30:07.343 --> 00:30:11.970
her work is almost impossible--
which is course a point of

00:30:11.970 --> 00:30:17.250
praise--to distinguish from that
of Alexander Pope.

00:30:17.250 --> 00:30:21.521
She is an instance of the first
phase, which Cooke calls

00:30:21.521 --> 00:30:23.618
"self-veiling."
 

00:30:23.618 --> 00:30:25.810
The second phase,
which Cooke calls

00:30:25.810 --> 00:30:28.838
"solitude,"
involves continuing to use

00:30:28.838 --> 00:30:31.795
white models,
a white prose style,

00:30:31.795 --> 00:30:36.732
a way of narrating which is
obviously derived from white

00:30:36.732 --> 00:30:42.298
teachers and white models but
which nevertheless involves,

00:30:42.298 --> 00:30:45.460
as its central theme,
self-definition.

00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:50.376
Here you might want to think of
Douglass and of slave narratives

00:30:50.376 --> 00:30:54.611
in general,
where the emphasis is on being

00:30:54.611 --> 00:30:59.682
taught by white people,
but nevertheless there is a

00:30:59.682 --> 00:31:04.405
tension which exists and which
founds and governs the

00:31:04.405 --> 00:31:09.038
possibility of self-liberation
and self-freedom.

00:31:09.038 --> 00:31:12.020
In other words,
the slave narrative as an

00:31:12.020 --> 00:31:16.491
ongoing form partakes of this
second phase in the development

00:31:16.491 --> 00:31:20.890
of African-American literature
as Cooke understands it.

00:31:20.890 --> 00:31:24.329
Thirdly, there is what Cooke
calls "kinship,"

00:31:24.329 --> 00:31:27.898
a literature in which African
Americans reach out to each

00:31:27.898 --> 00:31:30.452
other,
identify themselves as a

00:31:30.452 --> 00:31:33.747
community,
not as individuals struggling

00:31:33.747 --> 00:31:36.848
to be free but rather as a
community.

00:31:36.848 --> 00:31:43.692
Cooke identifies this phase
with the experimentation with

00:31:43.692 --> 00:31:51.023
dialect and a way of narrating
and poetizing which involves a

00:31:51.023 --> 00:31:57.011
self-conscious insistence on
verbal and linguistic

00:31:57.011 --> 00:31:59.088
difference.
 

00:31:59.088 --> 00:32:01.999
You can think of many of the
poems, for example,

00:32:01.999 --> 00:32:05.528
of Langston Hughes in this
regard and of a great deal else

00:32:05.528 --> 00:32:08.190
that goes on in the Harlem
Renaissance;

00:32:08.190 --> 00:32:11.180
so that's the third phase,
kinship.

00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:14.499
Then the last phase--and what
I'm going to want to say is that

00:32:14.499 --> 00:32:16.730
Gates doesn't think we've
reached this.

00:32:16.730 --> 00:32:19.178
In other words,
the point of disagreement

00:32:19.178 --> 00:32:22.240
between Cooke and Gates is
precisely about this.

00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:24.596
The last phase,
which Cooke calls

00:32:24.596 --> 00:32:28.280
"intimacy,"
is the freedom to expropriate

00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:32.608
any and all models,
not in other words to insist

00:32:32.608 --> 00:32:37.546
necessarily on one's own
creative paradigms as a racial

00:32:37.546 --> 00:32:42.664
tradition but to expropriate
anything that comes ready to

00:32:42.664 --> 00:32:43.578
hand.
 

00:32:43.578 --> 00:32:46.344
Ellison's Invisible
Man, for example,

00:32:46.344 --> 00:32:48.390
is a masterpiece of High
Modernism.

00:32:48.390 --> 00:32:51.173
It takes freely,
in other words,

00:32:51.173 --> 00:32:56.291
from whatever traditions come
to hand and are most readily

00:32:56.291 --> 00:33:01.680
available for the kind of work
that Ellison wants to do.

00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:04.866
Cooke identifies this perhaps
rather optimistically with what

00:33:04.866 --> 00:33:07.470
he calls "intimacy":
in other words,

00:33:07.470 --> 00:33:12.920
a merger, a finally achieved
merger of traditions such that--

00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:17.288
and this is plainly the ideal
of Virginia Woolf as well--

00:33:17.288 --> 00:33:22.838
such that one no longer has to
write as a spokesperson.

00:33:22.838 --> 00:33:28.442
One no longer needs to be
concerned with thematizing the

00:33:28.442 --> 00:33:34.348
kinds of identity out of which
one's writing has arisen.

00:33:34.348 --> 00:33:37.269
One can write just anything one
wants to--

00:33:37.269 --> 00:33:40.897
in other words,
the utopian vision of "no

00:33:40.897 --> 00:33:45.309
matter who I am,
I have access to absolutely any

00:33:45.309 --> 00:33:49.400
forms and themes I care to work
with."

00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:52.700
That is the vision of Michael
Cooke,

00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:55.500
which Gates,
I think, unfortunately,

00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:59.548
rightly feels that we haven't
quite arrived at,

00:33:59.548 --> 00:34:02.593
and that's why I deliberately
used the word

00:34:02.593 --> 00:34:06.505
"expropriate"
in talking about Cooke's fourth

00:34:06.505 --> 00:34:07.230
phase.
 

00:34:07.230 --> 00:34:12.612
If I use models other than
models made available by my own

00:34:12.612 --> 00:34:18.469
tradition, I'm not just kind of
pulling them out of the air.

00:34:18.469 --> 00:34:22.010
I'm using them with a
calculated purpose.

00:34:22.010 --> 00:34:26.382
I always have something in mind
in choosing the model that I

00:34:26.382 --> 00:34:27.050
choose.
 

00:34:27.050 --> 00:34:33.460
We're not really quite at
intimacy because self-definition

00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:35.710
is still at issue.
 

00:34:35.710 --> 00:34:38.581
You can talk about the High
Modernism of the Invisible

00:34:38.581 --> 00:34:40.735
Man all you like,
but think of what the

00:34:40.735 --> 00:34:42.480
Invisible Man is about.
 

00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:46.222
The Invisible Man is
still about what it means to be

00:34:46.222 --> 00:34:46.739
black.
 

00:34:46.739 --> 00:34:49.869
What is "passing"?
 

00:34:49.869 --> 00:34:55.865
What does it mean in other
words to have this racial

00:34:55.865 --> 00:34:57.159
identity?
 

00:34:57.159 --> 00:35:00.630
So that, yes:
traditions, manners,

00:35:00.630 --> 00:35:06.454
styles have been expropriated,
but at the same time the

00:35:06.454 --> 00:35:11.849
business of writing as an
African American continues,

00:35:11.849 --> 00:35:15.699
and it is as much,
after all, a question of

00:35:15.699 --> 00:35:19.550
self-definition as it has been
hitherto.

00:35:19.550 --> 00:35:25.619
As Gates sees it,
it continues to be the issue.

00:35:25.619 --> 00:35:27.389
We use other models.
 

00:35:27.389 --> 00:35:30.840
We need to make them our own.
 

00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:35.184
Otherwise we're just colonized
by them, and then after all

00:35:35.184 --> 00:35:37.699
we're back in phase one,
right?

00:35:37.699 --> 00:35:40.657
We're back in self-veiling
because, after all,

00:35:40.657 --> 00:35:43.090
Phillis Wheatley used other
models.

00:35:43.090 --> 00:35:47.320
Phillis Wheatley actually
aspired to the idea that she was

00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:48.880
just a poet.
 

00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:51.650
She could write about anything
she wanted to write about--

00:35:51.650 --> 00:35:54.849
the tears of Niobe in the
painting by Richard Wilson--

00:35:54.849 --> 00:35:58.143
whatever it might be,
she could write about it

00:35:58.143 --> 00:36:00.340
because she was just a poet.
 

00:36:00.340 --> 00:36:06.909
That was her great aspiration,
to be received not as

00:36:06.909 --> 00:36:12.347
that amazing thing,
a young black slave woman who

00:36:12.347 --> 00:36:14.159
could write.
 

00:36:14.159 --> 00:36:16.090
She wasn't interested in that.
 

00:36:16.090 --> 00:36:21.014
She wanted to be a poet,
and so in a certain sense you

00:36:21.014 --> 00:36:23.059
can see the problem.
 

00:36:23.059 --> 00:36:27.199
If intimacy is achieved in the
fourth phase,

00:36:27.199 --> 00:36:30.268
well, then that's finally just
the realization of what Phillis

00:36:30.268 --> 00:36:32.179
Wheatley wanted in the first
phase,

00:36:32.179 --> 00:36:33.000
&gt;
 

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:36.384
and we have to admit,
for all of the complicated

00:36:36.384 --> 00:36:39.119
reasons that these critics go
into,

00:36:39.119 --> 00:36:43.485
that this is not a moment which
can be said yet to have been

00:36:43.485 --> 00:36:44.300
achieved.
 

00:36:44.300 --> 00:36:45.260
Okay.
 

00:36:45.260 --> 00:36:51.824
Now this brings us to Gates's
key concept: what does it mean

00:36:51.824 --> 00:36:56.719
to expropriate other people's
traditions,

00:36:56.719 --> 00:37:00.750
more particularly the white
tradition,

00:37:00.750 --> 00:37:04.994
Here Gates is after all
thinking primarily about

00:37:04.994 --> 00:37:06.079
criticism.
 

00:37:06.079 --> 00:37:12.797
How can we do theory and
criticism in the white man's

00:37:12.797 --> 00:37:14.219
language?
 

00:37:14.219 --> 00:37:19.949
How can we appropriate or
expropriate for ourselves the

00:37:19.949 --> 00:37:22.389
white man's language?
 

00:37:22.389 --> 00:37:27.467
The necessity of bending
language to one's own purposes

00:37:27.467 --> 00:37:33.112
is what is emphasized in the
remarkable epigraph on page 1891

00:37:33.112 --> 00:37:36.309
that Gates takes from Bakhtin.
 

00:37:36.309 --> 00:37:40.036
This is, it seems to me,
as central a passage in

00:37:40.036 --> 00:37:42.615
Bakhtin,
by the way, as anything that we

00:37:42.615 --> 00:37:45.260
studied when we were actually
reading Bakhtin,

00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:49.320
and I'd like you to make note
of it because I think it really

00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:53.246
can illuminate a great deal
that's going on in Bakhtin that

00:37:53.246 --> 00:37:56.699
we didn't perhaps fully
articulate at the time.

00:37:56.699 --> 00:38:00.061
This is what Bakhtin says:
â€¦ language,

00:38:00.061 --> 00:38:02.304
for the individual
consciousness,

00:38:02.304 --> 00:38:06.230
lies on the borderline between
oneself and the other.

00:38:06.230 --> 00:38:09.760
The word in language is half
someone else's.

00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:15.353
It becomes "one's
own" only when the speaker

00:38:15.353 --> 00:38:19.469
populates it with his own
intention,

00:38:19.469 --> 00:38:25.072
his own accent [and you can
hear Gates wanting to emphasize

00:38:25.072 --> 00:38:30.641
that word "accent"],
when he appropriates the word,

00:38:30.641 --> 00:38:35.250
adapting it to his own semantic
and expressive intention.

00:38:35.250 --> 00:38:38.420
Prior to this moment of
appropriation,

00:38:38.420 --> 00:38:43.050
the word does not exist in a
neutral and impersonal language

00:38:43.050 --> 00:38:46.056
(it is not,
after all, out of a dictionary

00:38:46.056 --> 00:38:48.219
that the speaker gets his
words!)

00:38:48.219 --> 00:38:58.030
[how true], but rather it
exists in other people's mouths,

00:38:58.030 --> 00:39:02.143
in other people's contexts,
serving other people's

00:39:02.143 --> 00:39:07.179
intentions: it is from there
that one must take the word,

00:39:07.179 --> 00:39:09.590
and make it "one's
own."

00:39:09.590 --> 00:39:13.239
Now actually during the course
of his essay,

00:39:13.239 --> 00:39:18.612
Gates echoes this sentiment of
Bakhtin by quoting Derrida at

00:39:18.612 --> 00:39:23.530
the very top of the right-hand
column on page 1901,

00:39:23.530 --> 00:39:26.268
where he says,
"We must master,

00:39:26.268 --> 00:39:29.557
as Derrida wrote,
'how to speak the other's

00:39:29.557 --> 00:39:33.159
language without renouncing
(our) own."

00:39:33.159 --> 00:39:35.880
Now how do you do this?
 

00:39:35.880 --> 00:39:41.768
How do you set about talking
the language you are given?

00:39:41.768 --> 00:39:43.851
This isn't, of course,
just a question of the

00:39:43.851 --> 00:39:45.320
difference between the races.
 

00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:48.389
It's a question of all of us in
relation to each other.

00:39:48.389 --> 00:39:51.501
As Bakhtin says in what you
have already read,

00:39:51.501 --> 00:39:55.579
most of the time we're speaking
other people's languages.

00:39:55.579 --> 00:40:01.465
It is rare indeed that we can
say, feeling very much like

00:40:01.465 --> 00:40:07.079
creative writers when we do so,
that we have somehow wrenched

00:40:07.079 --> 00:40:11.443
other people's language out of
its conventional usages and made

00:40:11.443 --> 00:40:14.994
it our own,
slightly rewritten it so that

00:40:14.994 --> 00:40:16.800
it is truly our own.
 

00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:21.161
So more broadly speaking,
this is the challenge that

00:40:21.161 --> 00:40:26.380
faces a theoretical tradition or
a theoretical enterprise,

00:40:26.380 --> 00:40:29.398
I should say,
that doesn't want to be just

00:40:29.398 --> 00:40:33.300
derivative from what other folks
have already said.

00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:37.320
The concept that Gates brings
to bear on this,

00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:41.826
because after all he
recognizes, as does Showalter

00:40:41.826 --> 00:40:44.293
too,
that the notion of the

00:40:44.293 --> 00:40:48.601
sign is probably the
cornerstone of white male

00:40:48.601 --> 00:40:52.492
literary theory--
he recognizes that in order to

00:40:52.492 --> 00:40:56.565
perform this expropriative act,
he's got to do something with

00:40:56.565 --> 00:41:01.088
the notion of the sign,
and so he talks about the way

00:41:01.088 --> 00:41:06.050
in which one can signify
on something.

00:41:06.050 --> 00:41:09.735
He introduces it very quietly
on page 1900,

00:41:09.735 --> 00:41:13.945
the right-hand column,
just seemingly in passing,

00:41:13.945 --> 00:41:17.719
near the top of the right-hand
column:

00:41:17.719 --> 00:41:19.902
Since writing,
according to Hume,

00:41:19.902 --> 00:41:23.518
was the ultimate sign of
difference between animal and

00:41:23.518 --> 00:41:26.385
human,
these writers implicitly were

00:41:26.385 --> 00:41:30.619
Signifyin(g) upon the figure of
the chain itselfâ€¦

00:41:30.619 --> 00:41:34.530
Notice the accent.
 

00:41:34.530 --> 00:41:37.775
You don't necessarily pronounce
the g:

00:41:37.775 --> 00:41:40.429
they were signifyin' on the
chain.

00:41:40.429 --> 00:41:44.155
Of course, the great chain of
being, which is hierarchical,

00:41:44.155 --> 00:41:47.559
is very different from the
vertical chain of the chain

00:41:47.559 --> 00:41:48.780
gang, isn't it?
 

00:41:48.780 --> 00:41:52.291
It's very different from the
chain that holds slaves

00:41:52.291 --> 00:41:53.050
together.
 

00:41:53.050 --> 00:41:57.215
That's part of what it means to
"signify on"

00:41:57.215 --> 00:41:58.159
something.
 

00:41:58.159 --> 00:42:01.873
At least allegedly,
the "signifier"

00:42:01.873 --> 00:42:06.599
in the white male theoretical
tradition is just a kind of

00:42:06.599 --> 00:42:10.989
placeholder in a play of
linguistic differences.

00:42:10.989 --> 00:42:15.494
The question of the underlying
sociological and cultural basis

00:42:15.494 --> 00:42:19.704
of this play and of the way in
which this play takes shape

00:42:19.704 --> 00:42:23.014
isn't taken into account--
again, allegedly--

00:42:23.014 --> 00:42:25.632
because--well,
in ways that you can probably

00:42:25.632 --> 00:42:28.130
grasp from what we've said all
along,

00:42:28.130 --> 00:42:30.478
this is slightly to
oversimplify,

00:42:30.478 --> 00:42:33.119
but this is the position taken
up.

00:42:33.119 --> 00:42:36.097
In any case,
you therefore need to take the

00:42:36.097 --> 00:42:38.719
signifier and signify on
it.

00:42:38.719 --> 00:42:40.789
Well, what is it to signify on
something?

00:42:40.789 --> 00:42:45.358
This is an expression that
Gates takes from the trickster

00:42:45.358 --> 00:42:48.826
tradition,
the tradition of African

00:42:48.826 --> 00:42:54.340
storytelling in which the weaker
is also the smarter,

00:42:54.340 --> 00:42:57.610
and the monkey or Anansi the
Spider--

00:42:57.610 --> 00:43:00.797
some of you may remember the
songs of Rafi from your

00:43:00.797 --> 00:43:03.110
childhood about Anansi the
Spider--

00:43:03.110 --> 00:43:07.489
in which the monkey or the
spider tricks the big,

00:43:07.489 --> 00:43:10.070
bad guys, the elephant,
the lion.

00:43:10.070 --> 00:43:13.768
All of the bad guys get tricked
because they are stupider,

00:43:13.768 --> 00:43:19.340
and the little guy is always
able to signify on them,

00:43:19.340 --> 00:43:22.371
to trick them,
and to lie to them without

00:43:22.371 --> 00:43:24.949
their realizing what's going on.
 

00:43:24.949 --> 00:43:29.804
This way of talking about
signifying is very much in the

00:43:29.804 --> 00:43:34.746
tradition of African-American
folklore and first comes to

00:43:34.746 --> 00:43:40.130
public consciousness in a song
by the scat singer Oscar Brown,

00:43:40.130 --> 00:43:44.454
Jr., written by Oscar Brown,
Jr., called "The

00:43:44.454 --> 00:43:47.280
Signifyin' Monkey."
 

00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:49.480
If I could sing,
I'd sing it to you.

00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:51.695
Fortunately,
I can't sing,

00:43:51.695 --> 00:43:56.927
but it became extremely popular
and was picked up by various

00:43:56.927 --> 00:44:02.423
instrumental jazz groups and was
a staple in the jazz tradition

00:44:02.423 --> 00:44:05.349
of the fifties and sixties.
 

00:44:05.349 --> 00:44:09.755
In any case,
Oscar Brown Jr.'s notion of the

00:44:09.755 --> 00:44:16.311
signifying monkey is where Gates
takes his essay's title from and

00:44:16.311 --> 00:44:22.661
which is where also he gets this
idea of taking somebody else's

00:44:22.661 --> 00:44:29.115
discourse out of its context and
insisting on bending it into an

00:44:29.115 --> 00:44:33.856
African-American context--
in other words,

00:44:33.856 --> 00:44:38.795
a context which is one's own
and not just the context one is

00:44:38.795 --> 00:44:39.550
given.
 

00:44:39.550 --> 00:44:44.148
Now the other example of
"signifyin' on"

00:44:44.148 --> 00:44:49.030
that Gates gives is the
culminating example of The

00:44:49.030 --> 00:44:55.038
Color Purple, and the
conversation about "gettin'

00:44:55.038 --> 00:45:00.764
the man out of your eye,"
which is a way of taking back a

00:45:00.764 --> 00:45:07.429
problem that exists even within
the African-American tradition.

00:45:07.429 --> 00:45:12.934
As Gates has been pointing out,
Wheatley and later Rebecca

00:45:12.934 --> 00:45:18.536
Jackson take their models of
education and self-development

00:45:18.536 --> 00:45:24.429
from white male figures who have
taught them how to read.

00:45:24.429 --> 00:45:29.606
In each case of course,
this is pernicious because the

00:45:29.606 --> 00:45:34.980
existence of the white male
figure is very much still in

00:45:34.980 --> 00:45:36.250
your eye.
 

00:45:36.250 --> 00:45:39.559
You got to get the man out of
your eye, at least according to

00:45:39.559 --> 00:45:42.760
the dialogue Gates quotes from
The Color Purple.

00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:46.775
Well, the interesting thing
there is that in a way the issue

00:45:46.775 --> 00:45:50.657
of feminist criticism comes back
to haunt Gates's argument

00:45:50.657 --> 00:45:54.606
because plainly Shug doesn't
just mean the white man

00:45:54.606 --> 00:45:57.329
when she says "the
man."

00:45:57.329 --> 00:46:00.369
A big issue in The Color
Purple, of course,

00:46:00.369 --> 00:46:05.056
is the emergence of a possible
feminism from social

00:46:05.056 --> 00:46:09.650
constructions that aren't just
defined by race;

00:46:09.650 --> 00:46:13.034
so that when Gates says
"the man,"

00:46:13.034 --> 00:46:17.518
which all of us recognize as
shorthand for "the white

00:46:17.518 --> 00:46:21.612
man," can be signified on
by an African-American

00:46:21.612 --> 00:46:25.335
tradition,
making it a term of opprobrium,

00:46:25.335 --> 00:46:27.295
right?--
"get the man out of your

00:46:27.295 --> 00:46:29.744
eye"--
at the same time it can be

00:46:29.744 --> 00:46:33.300
signified on by the
feminist tradition,

00:46:33.300 --> 00:46:37.117
making it a term of opprobrium
not in a completely different

00:46:37.117 --> 00:46:39.425
way,
but in an overlapping and

00:46:39.425 --> 00:46:41.280
partially different way.
 

00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:45.840
Gates, in emphasizing the one
as opposed to the other,

00:46:45.840 --> 00:46:50.489
is perhaps tilting again toward
a certain imbalance.

00:46:50.489 --> 00:46:54.030
Now finally I want to take up
the example,

00:46:54.030 --> 00:46:57.730
the most controversial example
in his essay,

00:46:57.730 --> 00:47:00.960
one which is a source of
outrage for most readers,

00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:06.449
at the bottom of page 1893 in
the left-hand column.

00:47:06.449 --> 00:47:11.336
He's been talking about the New
Agrarian moment out of which

00:47:11.336 --> 00:47:15.976
there emerged a number of
figures associated with the New

00:47:15.976 --> 00:47:19.717
Criticism,
including Robert Penn Warren,

00:47:19.717 --> 00:47:24.713
who very early on repudiated
the New Agrarians and became a

00:47:24.713 --> 00:47:29.280
politically progressive figure
in his own writing.

00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:32.195
Many of you have probably read
All the King's Men,

00:47:32.195 --> 00:47:34.440
certainly,
and his poetry as well.

00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:37.344
He was an avatar,
a central figure,

00:47:37.344 --> 00:47:42.043
in the development of the
thinking of the New Criticism,

00:47:42.043 --> 00:47:44.949
which we have briefly studied.
 

00:47:44.949 --> 00:47:49.041
Now Warren wrote a poem called
"Pondy Woods,"

00:47:49.041 --> 00:47:53.739
which is quoted completely out
of context by Sterling Brown and

00:47:53.739 --> 00:47:58.286
unfairly out of context in the
passage which I'm not going to

00:47:58.286 --> 00:48:02.454
read because I don't think I
have the right to speak the

00:48:02.454 --> 00:48:08.130
"N-word";
so I'll just have you look at

00:48:08.130 --> 00:48:13.639
it--and I'll come back to that
in a minute.

00:48:13.639 --> 00:48:18.500
Sterling Brown's response is
also recorded there for you.

00:48:18.500 --> 00:48:22.070
Well, the problem is,
from the standpoint of anybody

00:48:22.070 --> 00:48:26.045
who's actually read the poem--
but remember in some ways it's

00:48:26.045 --> 00:48:28.880
a problem raised by a New
Critical perspective,

00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:33.280
and I'll explain what I mean in
a minute--

00:48:33.280 --> 00:48:40.889
that expression is spoken by a
buzzard or vulture from--

00:48:40.889 --> 00:48:43.570
I forget whether it's Tennessee
or Kentucky.

00:48:43.570 --> 00:48:47.860
The episode takes place in
northern Louisiana,

00:48:47.860 --> 00:48:52.987
and the buzzard is sitting
expectantly on a tree waiting

00:48:52.987 --> 00:48:58.302
for a fugitive slave who has
been chased into the swamp by

00:48:58.302 --> 00:49:01.099
his white pursuers to die.
 

00:49:01.099 --> 00:49:03.835
The vulture is sitting
there--well, if it could it

00:49:03.835 --> 00:49:07.240
would be--rubbing its hands with
glee waiting for this to take

00:49:07.240 --> 00:49:07.800
place.
 

00:49:07.800 --> 00:49:11.867
It's the vulture that says it
in the poem: nothing to do in

00:49:11.867 --> 00:49:15.289
other words,
as we say, with the author of

00:49:15.289 --> 00:49:18.514
the poem,
Warren, who is writing a

00:49:18.514 --> 00:49:24.036
completely sympathetic evocation
of what it's like to be a

00:49:24.036 --> 00:49:30.429
fugitive slave in this state of
terrible and overwhelmed panic.

00:49:30.429 --> 00:49:34.690
So it seems completely unfair
and it is, I think,

00:49:34.690 --> 00:49:39.306
unfair as Sterling Brown took
it up and as Gates then

00:49:39.306 --> 00:49:43.389
perpetuates the idea in his own
reference.

00:49:43.389 --> 00:49:47.362
The one thing I would add,
however, is that it's a New

00:49:47.362 --> 00:49:52.010
Critical idea that we invoke to
say that it's unfair.

00:49:52.010 --> 00:49:56.818
It's the New Criticism,
in which Robert Penn Warren was

00:49:56.818 --> 00:50:00.380
a participant,
that tells us we shouldn't

00:50:00.380 --> 00:50:04.210
confuse speakers in poems with
authors.

00:50:04.210 --> 00:50:07.639
In other words,
an author is someone,

00:50:07.639 --> 00:50:11.525
according to the New Criticism,
who is dispassionate and who

00:50:11.525 --> 00:50:14.820
introduces dramatic voices even
in lyric poems,

00:50:14.820 --> 00:50:20.623
voices with which we are merely
confusing ourselves if we

00:50:20.623 --> 00:50:23.940
associate them with an author.
 

00:50:23.940 --> 00:50:28.351
Now this is something that we
just take for granted when we

00:50:28.351 --> 00:50:29.340
read poems.
 

00:50:29.340 --> 00:50:33.106
All poems for us are to some
degree dramatic monologues on

00:50:33.106 --> 00:50:37.139
the model of Browning and others
in the nineteenth century.

00:50:37.139 --> 00:50:39.199
We read them that way now,
but it is,

00:50:39.199 --> 00:50:43.650
as I say, a New Critical idea,
and it comes back to the

00:50:43.650 --> 00:50:47.184
question,
"Who has the right to use

00:50:47.184 --> 00:50:48.880
the 'N-word'?"
 

00:50:48.880 --> 00:50:54.139
It's a frequent term used on
the street,

00:50:54.139 --> 00:50:56.760
as you know,
in African-American culture,

00:50:56.760 --> 00:51:01.545
used almost with a certain
fondness as a form of mutual

00:51:01.545 --> 00:51:04.684
greeting,
but at the same time it is a

00:51:04.684 --> 00:51:09.130
term that continues rigorously
to be rejected as available to

00:51:09.130 --> 00:51:13.800
anyone other than someone who
belongs within this community.

00:51:13.800 --> 00:51:15.789
And so that issue lingers.
 

00:51:15.789 --> 00:51:19.309
It's an issue that
Warren--because of course he

00:51:19.309 --> 00:51:22.983
wrote long before this
controversy began to arise

00:51:22.983 --> 00:51:26.177
around the word--
the controversy really boiled

00:51:26.177 --> 00:51:29.353
over precisely at the time of
the banning of Huckleberry

00:51:29.353 --> 00:51:33.393
Finn from public schools,
much later, and so there's a

00:51:33.393 --> 00:51:37.780
kind of innocence perhaps in
Warren's use of the word.

00:51:37.780 --> 00:51:40.407
Nevertheless,
in the critical tradition it's

00:51:40.407 --> 00:51:43.710
a question, "Who has the
right to use it?"

00:51:43.710 --> 00:51:48.628
This gives rise perhaps to the
suggestion of a certain

00:51:48.628 --> 00:51:53.268
insularity in the thinking of
the New Criticism.

00:51:53.268 --> 00:51:56.313
Use any model you like:
the model of the Freudian

00:51:56.313 --> 00:51:59.739
unconscious, the model of the
political unconscious.

00:51:59.739 --> 00:52:02.525
In other words,
we've been reading a lot in

00:52:02.525 --> 00:52:06.172
this course about our never
quite saying what we mean to

00:52:06.172 --> 00:52:09.032
say,
of our never quite being fully

00:52:09.032 --> 00:52:13.329
in control of our discourse
because it bubbles up from the

00:52:13.329 --> 00:52:14.989
unconscious, right?
 

00:52:14.989 --> 00:52:19.418
Now if you take a model like
this, even though it's a nasty

00:52:19.418 --> 00:52:23.768
buzzard from Kentucky that's
saying what Gates quotes,

00:52:23.768 --> 00:52:27.480
nevertheless there is an
author, and it has bubbled up

00:52:27.480 --> 00:52:29.650
from the unconscious of that.
 

00:52:29.650 --> 00:52:30.989
Well, what are you going to do
with that?

00:52:30.989 --> 00:52:33.360
There's a kind of impasse there.
 

00:52:33.360 --> 00:52:37.440
We feel distinctly and vividly
and even bitterly--

00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:40.067
because I love Warren,
I love "Pondy Woods"

00:52:40.067 --> 00:52:42.239
and I also am something of a
New Critic--

00:52:42.239 --> 00:52:46.440
so we feel a bitterness about
the expropriation,

00:52:46.440 --> 00:52:50.771
the "signifying on"
what Warren says in this

00:52:50.771 --> 00:52:51.590
fashion.
 

00:52:51.590 --> 00:52:56.014
At the same time,
we have entertained these ideas

00:52:56.014 --> 00:53:00.902
of a subliminal author,
not an authority but an author

00:53:00.902 --> 00:53:03.300
welling up from below.
 

00:53:03.300 --> 00:53:08.744
If that's the case,
then we have to worry a little

00:53:08.744 --> 00:53:15.411
bit about how an expression like
that got into the poem after

00:53:15.411 --> 00:53:16.300
all.
 

00:53:16.300 --> 00:53:20.644
I call it a lingering problem
because it strikes me as one of

00:53:20.644 --> 00:53:25.061
those moments when probably it
would have been better if Gates

00:53:25.061 --> 00:53:30.349
hadn't followed Sterling Brown,
one of those moments when there

00:53:30.349 --> 00:53:34.929
is a kind of overkill in the
zeal of argumentation,

00:53:34.929 --> 00:53:39.072
but which at the same time we
can't absolutely dismiss out of

00:53:39.072 --> 00:53:42.940
hand for the variety of reasons
that I have mentioned.

00:53:42.940 --> 00:53:43.510
Okay.
 

00:53:43.510 --> 00:53:46.969
I'll leave it there,
and we'll return to many of

00:53:46.969 --> 00:53:51.461
these issues in a new vocabulary
and in new forms when we read

00:53:51.461 --> 00:53:55.510
the examples of post-colonial
criticism on Thursday that

00:53:55.510 --> 00:53:57.500
you've been assigned.

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:06.408
Prof: Okay,
today the coming of mass

00:00:06.408 --> 00:00:12.125
affluence to the advanced
economies, principally the

00:00:12.125 --> 00:00:15.040
economies of the west.
 

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.961
Jennifer, speaking of informal
property rights,

00:00:17.961 --> 00:00:20.820
I thought you owned a chair
right up there?

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.120
I 'm just kidding.
 

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:31.950
I'm going to take it in three
chunks.

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:35.730
We're going to look at big
picture,

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.380
causal explanations for the
rise of mass affluence,

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.560
and for explanations first of
its rise,

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.362
and second, its rise beginning
in Western Europe and North

00:00:47.362 --> 00:00:48.030
America.
 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.128
Second, I'm going to
reintroduce the joint stock

00:00:53.128 --> 00:00:57.250
corporation into that
conversation,

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:02.045
and finally we're going to look
at the phenomenon of mass

00:01:02.045 --> 00:01:07.272
affluence and the advertising
culture of mid-twentieth century

00:01:07.272 --> 00:01:08.299
America.
 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:14.989
Then on Wednesday we're going
to descend to details,

00:01:14.989 --> 00:01:20.192
and the challenge for you in
preparing for Wednesday is to

00:01:20.192 --> 00:01:24.887
imagine a country,
and imagine that you somehow

00:01:24.887 --> 00:01:30.046
have been granted a fund
amounting to 5% of its gross

00:01:30.046 --> 00:01:35.498
domestic product,
and with that 5% you want to

00:01:35.498 --> 00:01:40.310
make whatever changes you can
imagine,

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:46.878
will increase the overall
wealth of that country as much

00:01:46.878 --> 00:01:48.550
as possible.
 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:52.140
It's a pragmatic question.
 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.596
It has a causal side to it,
but ultimately it's pragmatic

00:01:57.596 --> 00:02:00.909
and it is not one size fits all.
 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:04.340
That is, you've got to know
something about the country to

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.750
know something about what needs
doing;

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:14.540
5% of the GDP in Ghana will be
spent--will be wisely spent very

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:20.949
differently than 5% of the GDP
in Bolivia or Mexico,

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:22.710
or Norway.
 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:23.990
Okay.
 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:28.330
So the first of the three
topics is capitalist takeoff.

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:34.859
The portrait of this corpulent
and obviously affluent gent is

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:40.865
Sir Richard Arkwright,
who was the creator of the most

00:02:40.865 --> 00:02:44.680
efficient early textile
machinery,

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:50.520
and who unlike many others
about whom Clark talks,

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.378
actually profited very
handsomely from that work.

00:02:54.378 --> 00:02:59.726
By takeoff in the west,
and this goes back to the first

00:02:59.726 --> 00:03:04.457
day of class,
and by Wednesday we'll go back

00:03:04.457 --> 00:03:10.754
again to gapminder.org and look
at the bubbles moving through

00:03:10.754 --> 00:03:11.699
space.
 

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:14.151
This still photograph,
so to speak,

00:03:14.151 --> 00:03:18.188
covers a longer time horizon,
a 500 year time horizon.

00:03:18.188 --> 00:03:26.783
It shows an abrupt northward
movement in GDP per capita in

00:03:26.783 --> 00:03:35.530
the U.S., lagging a bit in
Japan, lagging further in China,

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.300
India, and Indonesia.
 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:45.008
If we just throw all the
countries in the world in a pot,

00:03:45.008 --> 00:03:49.030
we get a picture that looks
something like this,

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:56.860
where gross GDP is in blue,
population in green,

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:00.280
and the one divided by the
other in gold.

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:06.820
What we're interested in from
here to the end of term really

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:12.918
is in understanding what lies
behind these curves and in

00:04:12.918 --> 00:04:19.459
thinking about from a given a
country's point of view,

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:23.334
or from given class of people
in a given country's point of

00:04:23.334 --> 00:04:27.942
view,
how can we increase the rate at

00:04:27.942 --> 00:04:31.360
which things gets better?
 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:37.490
Now before I go further some of
you are thinking green thoughts.

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:41.843
Wave at me if you're thinking
green thoughts and wondering

00:04:41.843 --> 00:04:46.410
whether it's really a good idea;
I have so many people with so

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:48.379
much money in their pockets.
 

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:53.279
Sasha tell us.
 

00:04:53.279 --> 00:05:04.040
We got a microphone here?
 

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.887
Student:  I think
basically the root of all

00:05:06.887 --> 00:05:09.141
environmental problems,
if you care about the natural

00:05:09.141 --> 00:05:10.656
environment,
is that there are too many

00:05:10.656 --> 00:05:13.060
people, so you have more people
who can consume more.

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:16.665
The simple thing to think is
that that's bad news for the

00:05:16.665 --> 00:05:17.180
earth.
 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:20.684
Prof: Okay so you would
like to kill off a portion of

00:05:20.684 --> 00:05:22.170
the world's population.
 

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:23.240
Student:  Yes.
 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.776
Prof: Okay very
straightforward,

00:05:25.776 --> 00:05:27.579
good, clear MBA thinking.
 

00:05:27.579 --> 00:05:38.440
Given a constant world
population, if we had it,

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:41.004
would you prefer that that
population on average be a

00:05:41.004 --> 00:05:45.910
little less affluent then it is,
or that I seem to want it to be?

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:49.161
Student:  I'm not sure
that it's that straightforward

00:05:49.161 --> 00:05:52.831
because if people--
societies don't have the means

00:05:52.831 --> 00:05:57.077
to advance technology,
even though consumption does go

00:05:57.077 --> 00:05:59.298
up,
you have cleaner technologies

00:05:59.298 --> 00:06:03.079
that would be developed with
greater economic prosperity,

00:06:03.079 --> 00:06:06.389
so I'm not as clear on that one.
 

00:06:06.389 --> 00:06:08.879
Prof: Okay, not as clear.
 

00:06:08.879 --> 00:06:14.184
Now you would acknowledge that
as hundreds of millions of

00:06:14.184 --> 00:06:19.867
people living in places like
China and India come into income

00:06:19.867 --> 00:06:24.129
enough to have a family car or
even two,

00:06:24.129 --> 00:06:27.410
that there's a challenge there?
 

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:28.860
Student:  Certainly.
 

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:31.855
Prof: Okay,
so let's keep the natural

00:06:31.855 --> 00:06:35.690
environment in the background as
we talk about this,

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:39.319
but let's for the moment focus
on economics,

00:06:39.319 --> 00:06:42.629
and let's start with a curve
like this.

00:06:42.629 --> 00:06:46.759
The curve shows low income to
the left,

00:06:46.759 --> 00:06:51.291
high income to the right,
and the frequency of each

00:06:51.291 --> 00:06:55.100
income stratum is indicated
vertically,

00:06:55.100 --> 00:07:00.309
and the red curve is a fairly
typical market economy income

00:07:00.309 --> 00:07:04.800
distribution with a truncated
tail on the left,

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:07.790
and an elongated tail on the
right,

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:12.199
with the mean income being much
higher than the median because

00:07:12.199 --> 00:07:16.028
it is pulled to the right by the
very high incomes.

00:07:16.028 --> 00:07:21.177
If this chart were drawn to
scale that right hand tail would

00:07:21.177 --> 00:07:26.586
probably be even more elongated,
but wondrously thin out to the

00:07:26.586 --> 00:07:27.459
right.
 

00:07:27.459 --> 00:07:34.512
Well the phenomenon of takeoff
is the upward shift in that

00:07:34.512 --> 00:07:36.370
distribution.
 

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:40.815
It may change shape a little,
bit it's not mainly that it's

00:07:40.815 --> 00:07:44.781
changing shape;
it's that its mean is drifting

00:07:44.781 --> 00:07:47.000
upward and to the right.
 

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.899
If we think about two
distributions,

00:07:52.899 --> 00:07:57.185
two or three generations
removed from one another in a

00:07:57.185 --> 00:08:00.942
given society,
let's say the United States

00:08:00.942 --> 00:08:04.028
1920 and the United States
today,

00:08:04.028 --> 00:08:09.310
it will often be the case that
the difference is so dramatic

00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:14.682
that the material condition of
people living in the top tenth

00:08:14.682 --> 00:08:18.889
then will be about like the top
half today.

00:08:18.889 --> 00:08:27.850
And you keep that up for ten
generations or so,

00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:36.000
and you have something like
this, where the top decile in,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.336
let's say, 1800,
is living in material

00:08:39.336 --> 00:08:44.296
conditions that would be
equivalent to perhaps the ninth

00:08:44.296 --> 00:08:45.830
decile today.
 

00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:49.779
Not the very bottom,
but people living relatively

00:08:49.779 --> 00:08:51.259
near the bottom.
 

00:08:51.259 --> 00:08:57.511
This is particularly true if
you take into account not just

00:08:57.511 --> 00:09:00.722
income,
but what it is that income can

00:09:00.722 --> 00:09:05.748
buy in the way of medical care,
comfort and lodging,

00:09:05.748 --> 00:09:10.168
quality of diet,
and so forth.

00:09:10.168 --> 00:09:14.210
There's an enormous explosive
change in the background here.

00:09:14.210 --> 00:09:17.940
That change is our subject.
 

00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:22.837
Now how you feel about that
change is more complicated and

00:09:22.837 --> 00:09:27.048
we often hear that money doesn't
buy happiness.

00:09:27.048 --> 00:09:33.360
The people who say that have
evidence of a kind.

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:38.946
None of them volunteer to
become poor, and there is

00:09:38.946 --> 00:09:45.873
something that money buys that
people want, and we'll return to

00:09:45.873 --> 00:09:48.889
that from time to time.
 

00:09:48.889 --> 00:09:51.754
But imagine now that there
are--just think about an economy

00:09:51.754 --> 00:09:56.123
with two people in it,
A's income or wealth is

00:09:56.123 --> 00:10:01.669
measured vertically,
B's is measured horizontally,

00:10:01.669 --> 00:10:03.428
and you're Mr. A.
 

00:10:03.428 --> 00:10:09.787
Which of these two outcomes
would you prefer on--by one way

00:10:09.787 --> 00:10:14.720
of thinking you're maximizing
your own income,

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:17.678
you'd like to be there.
 

00:10:17.678 --> 00:10:21.976
If on the other hand,
what you're doing is staying

00:10:21.976 --> 00:10:26.100
ahead of the Joneses,
you'd like to be there.

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:31.452
More generally,
if you're just trying to

00:10:31.452 --> 00:10:36.668
maximize your own household
income,

00:10:36.668 --> 00:10:39.750
you will have indifference
curves like these horizontal

00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:42.658
ones and just seek to climb as
high as possible,

00:10:42.658 --> 00:10:46.904
and you'll be perfectly content
if others climb at the same

00:10:46.904 --> 00:10:48.330
rate,
or even a higher rate.

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:52.115
On the other hand,
you may be calculating the

00:10:52.115 --> 00:10:57.364
ratio of your household to other
households that you choose to

00:10:57.364 --> 00:11:02.268
compare yourself with and the
indifference curve will then

00:11:02.268 --> 00:11:06.139
become rays from the origin like
that,

00:11:06.139 --> 00:11:11.981
and you will be trying to swing
your position from bottom right

00:11:11.981 --> 00:11:13.490
to upper left.
 

00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:19.696
One function is just maximize
one variable and the other is

00:11:19.696 --> 00:11:25.153
maximize the ratio of two
variables, and most people

00:11:25.153 --> 00:11:29.220
are--tend to mix these two
things.

00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:36.476
The--their contentment with
their material position is

00:11:36.476 --> 00:11:41.679
partly relative and partly
absolute;

00:11:41.679 --> 00:11:44.460
absolute here, relative there.
 

00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:51.383
If you think about the
employees of a firm,

00:11:51.383 --> 00:12:00.450
the way they're compensated
is--raises both concerns.

00:12:00.450 --> 00:12:09.369
Suppose everybody in a law firm
is making between $150,000 and

00:12:09.369 --> 00:12:17.119
$200,000, and along comes Jim
Alexander, ace corporate

00:12:17.119 --> 00:12:21.070
lawyer--
Jim Alexander:  Never.

00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:21.509
Prof: Never, I know.
 

00:12:21.509 --> 00:12:23.149
I'm abusing you.
 

00:12:23.149 --> 00:12:27.509
Never, and--all right Leslie
Hough,

00:12:27.509 --> 00:12:31.774
ace corporate lawyer,
and we really need her and

00:12:31.774 --> 00:12:37.039
we've got to pay her $800,000
and we make the offer and she

00:12:37.039 --> 00:12:38.220
takes it.
 

00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:43.471
There will be a--if this fact
becomes public within the firm,

00:12:43.471 --> 00:12:47.759
which is quite likely,
everybody else will in some

00:12:47.759 --> 00:12:50.908
measure feel impoverished by it.
 

00:12:50.908 --> 00:12:54.379
She's making four times what
I'm making;

00:12:54.379 --> 00:12:58.246
surely she's not four times
better than me,

00:12:58.246 --> 00:13:03.220
so the relative and the
absolute are always at play.

00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:10.011
Now let's look through Clark's
explanations--and I spent almost

00:13:10.011 --> 00:13:16.365
all of yesterday reviewing
Clark, and he's kind of all over

00:13:16.365 --> 00:13:17.899
the place.
 

00:13:17.899 --> 00:13:20.070
There's some of everything in
this book,

00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:27.346
but let's pick out some of his
main explanations for economic

00:13:27.346 --> 00:13:30.783
takeoff,
and for the fact that the

00:13:30.783 --> 00:13:35.331
takeoff occurred first and most
dramatically in western

00:13:35.331 --> 00:13:39.211
countries,
and among western countries,

00:13:39.211 --> 00:13:42.009
first in the United Kingdom.
 

00:13:42.009 --> 00:13:49.129
His--there's a recurring theme,
it's in the beginning,

00:13:49.129 --> 00:13:50.480
the middle, and the end of the
book,

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:57.053
about his speculative
interpretation of wills from

00:13:57.053 --> 00:14:03.090
England in late medieval and
early modern--

00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:05.990
and right into modern times.
 

00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:12.823
The phenomenon he finds is a
fountain of wellborn children

00:14:12.823 --> 00:14:19.298
who cannot replicate their
parents place in society.

00:14:19.298 --> 00:14:22.860
The empirics on this are pretty
strong.

00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:29.590
That well to do families,
by and large,

00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:33.558
had more than two surviving
children reaching--

00:14:33.558 --> 00:14:35.908
more than two children reaching
adulthood,

00:14:35.908 --> 00:14:41.365
and indeed, the survival rate
among well to do children was

00:14:41.365 --> 00:14:46.256
quite a lot higher than the
survival rate among other

00:14:46.256 --> 00:14:47.480
children.
 

00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:51.504
If you read all the way to the
end of the book you discover

00:14:51.504 --> 00:14:55.529
that if you compare this with
Asian societies such as Japan

00:14:55.529 --> 00:14:59.804
and China,
the effect is stronger in

00:14:59.804 --> 00:15:00.970
England.
 

00:15:00.970 --> 00:15:05.616
From this he adduces several
consequences,

00:15:05.616 --> 00:15:11.851
the most obvious of which is
that many of these wellborn

00:15:11.851 --> 00:15:16.158
children will be downward
mobiles.

00:15:16.158 --> 00:15:18.710
The will marry beneath their
class,

00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:23.918
they will take up occupations
or roles beneath their parents'

00:15:23.918 --> 00:15:30.482
class,
and Clark is--he's trying to

00:15:30.482 --> 00:15:35.440
say two things at once.
 

00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:40.793
One is that the culture--the
universalization of culture from

00:15:40.793 --> 00:15:45.879
the top could in some measure be
promoted by this downward

00:15:45.879 --> 00:15:51.392
mobility;
that children raised with high

00:15:51.392 --> 00:16:00.530
expectations and upbringing may
be cultural carriers which would

00:16:00.530 --> 00:16:08.509
infuse lower economic strata
with a more energetic,

00:16:08.509 --> 00:16:11.668
more performance-oriented
outlook.

00:16:11.668 --> 00:16:16.505
For that there's no evidence in
this story, it's just a

00:16:16.505 --> 00:16:17.759
speculation.
 

00:16:17.759 --> 00:16:21.711
The other speculation,
for which there is also no

00:16:21.711 --> 00:16:28.390
specific evidence,
is a Darwinian genetics story

00:16:28.390 --> 00:16:32.813
in which--
and here Clark is--this is

00:16:32.813 --> 00:16:37.120
dangerous territory in the way
of politics.

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:43.235
He seems to believe that the
genes carried at the top of the

00:16:43.235 --> 00:16:49.352
income curve may be better genes
than those elsewhere in the

00:16:49.352 --> 00:16:53.789
income curve,
and that the downward--forced

00:16:53.789 --> 00:16:58.842
downward mobility of progeny
from that top level gene pool

00:16:58.842 --> 00:17:03.629
might upgrade the whole society
in a genetic sense.

00:17:03.629 --> 00:17:11.200
Anybody want to comment on that
thought?

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:13.430
Yes.
 

00:17:13.430 --> 00:17:18.351
Student:  I mean,
genetically speaking it's just

00:17:18.351 --> 00:17:21.904
sort of silly,
because traits don't pass

00:17:21.904 --> 00:17:23.088
directly.
 

00:17:23.088 --> 00:17:26.135
You aren't a clone of your
parents, or even just a 50/50

00:17:26.135 --> 00:17:26.578
combo.
 

00:17:26.578 --> 00:17:28.541
In terms of carrying skills
downward though,

00:17:28.541 --> 00:17:30.140
I mean that makes a lot of
sense.

00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:33.048
If you're well educated and you
bring that down you might

00:17:33.048 --> 00:17:34.970
educate your children,
values, etc.

00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:39.244
Prof: That's precisely
my own view, but does anybody

00:17:39.244 --> 00:17:41.308
want to defend Clark here?
 

00:17:41.308 --> 00:17:45.914
Student:  Well it could
be more of a bell curve

00:17:45.914 --> 00:17:49.130
situation, if you know what I
mean.

00:17:49.130 --> 00:17:57.068
The people on the higher end of
the income ladder have,

00:17:57.068 --> 00:18:03.002
over time, been privy to better
situations and better selection

00:18:03.002 --> 00:18:07.596
pressures leading to the
evolution of skills like

00:18:07.596 --> 00:18:11.511
analytical thinking,
intelligence skills that are

00:18:11.511 --> 00:18:14.721
necessary for the professions
that are characteristic of the

00:18:14.721 --> 00:18:15.700
higher classes.
 

00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:21.358
Prof: Let's have a vote
here.

00:18:21.358 --> 00:18:25.413
How many people think it's
likely that there is some

00:18:25.413 --> 00:18:30.102
validity to--let's start with
the cultural story and then go

00:18:30.102 --> 00:18:32.088
to the genetic story.
 

00:18:32.088 --> 00:18:35.808
How many people find the
cultural story broadly

00:18:35.808 --> 00:18:36.779
plausible?
 

00:18:36.779 --> 00:18:42.848
The opposite--implausible?
 

00:18:42.848 --> 00:18:46.801
Okay, and how many find the
genetics story broadly

00:18:46.801 --> 00:18:47.769
plausible?
 

00:18:47.769 --> 00:18:52.029
Fewer, but a substantial number.
 

00:18:52.029 --> 00:18:56.970
And how many find it
implausible?

00:18:56.970 --> 00:18:59.654
Okay, I have no idea,
and Clark provides not one

00:18:59.654 --> 00:19:02.509
shred of evidence with which we
could test this.

00:19:02.509 --> 00:19:07.702
My own guess is that a few
hundred years is a pretty short

00:19:07.702 --> 00:19:13.170
time for carrying out the kind
of selection process he has in

00:19:13.170 --> 00:19:13.990
mind.
 

00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:22.220
It's also the case that the
association between

00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:27.410
parental--let's call it IQ.
 

00:19:27.410 --> 00:19:30.769
The twin studies actually do
confirm this--

00:19:30.769 --> 00:19:33.664
where identical twins are born
to Mr.

00:19:33.664 --> 00:19:36.159
and Mrs. Smith and raised by
Mr.

00:19:36.159 --> 00:19:39.872
and Mrs. Jones,
in IQ and several other

00:19:39.872 --> 00:19:44.135
variables, the association
between the identical will be

00:19:44.135 --> 00:19:48.632
greater than between them and
the siblings belonging to the

00:19:48.632 --> 00:19:53.662
new family,
so genetics is not wholly out

00:19:53.662 --> 00:19:55.710
of the picture.
 

00:19:55.710 --> 00:20:00.142
On the other hand,
from a pragmatic point of view,

00:20:00.142 --> 00:20:05.842
which is where we're going with
all this, the idea of--well what

00:20:05.842 --> 00:20:07.380
was Eugenics?
 

00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:09.980
Does anybody--are any of you in
a history course,

00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:11.119
picked up Eugenics?
 

00:20:11.119 --> 00:20:14.930
Anyone?
 

00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:21.038
Student:  Eugenics is an
idea that in some form has

00:20:21.038 --> 00:20:25.383
existed since ancient times,
but really picked up in the

00:20:25.383 --> 00:20:28.358
late nineteenth century,
and then especially under the

00:20:28.358 --> 00:20:30.463
Third Reich,
where it was essentially

00:20:30.463 --> 00:20:33.420
believed that people at the top
tended to have better genes,

00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:35.430
or in the case of the Third
Reich, a specific racial group,

00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:37.710
and therefore you want to
maximize the number of people

00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:39.779
with certain desirable traits
for reproducing,

00:20:39.779 --> 00:20:42.083
and minimize the ability of
people with undesirable traits

00:20:42.083 --> 00:20:44.055
to reproduce,
resulting in a better,

00:20:44.055 --> 00:20:47.077
stronger, smarter,
in the case of the Nazis,

00:20:47.077 --> 00:20:48.170
blonder, race.
 

00:20:48.170 --> 00:20:50.578
Prof: Okay,
that's the gist of it.

00:20:50.578 --> 00:20:57.380
The heart of it,
which was most influential,

00:20:57.380 --> 00:21:03.196
had to do with trying to
prevent people who were mentally

00:21:03.196 --> 00:21:11.368
retarded from reproducing,
and a lot of that happened.

00:21:11.368 --> 00:21:18.690
The vulgar prejudices that lay
behind much of it,

00:21:18.690 --> 00:21:21.424
it was--much of it was
conducted by something called

00:21:21.424 --> 00:21:24.476
The Vineland Institute,
located near Princeton,

00:21:24.476 --> 00:21:28.318
New Jersey;
no guilt by association there.

00:21:28.318 --> 00:21:32.869
The Vineland Institute
published data showing that all

00:21:32.869 --> 00:21:36.818
the immigrant groups streaming
into the U.S.

00:21:36.818 --> 00:21:42.007
in the early twentieth century
were inferior to WASPS mentally,

00:21:42.007 --> 00:21:45.269
and they were very tough on the
Jews.

00:21:45.269 --> 00:21:48.489
The Jews are just not bright at
all, and they did this by

00:21:48.489 --> 00:21:51.823
administering English language
questionnaires to immigrants

00:21:51.823 --> 00:21:53.490
just after they got here.
 

00:21:53.490 --> 00:21:59.631
The pragmatics of culture are
something that's a lot easier to

00:21:59.631 --> 00:22:05.369
deal with, and which fits more
readily into the humanistic

00:22:05.369 --> 00:22:08.190
framework that we share.
 

00:22:08.190 --> 00:22:13.080
After "the fountain,"
which really doesn't fit into

00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:16.586
any of his categories,
Clark has three broad

00:22:16.586 --> 00:22:17.808
categories.
 

00:22:17.808 --> 00:22:21.881
One is exogenous growth
theories--exogenous meaning

00:22:21.881 --> 00:22:26.441
economic growth caused by
something that is--that has its

00:22:26.441 --> 00:22:29.778
origin outside of the market
economy.

00:22:29.778 --> 00:22:34.460
One of these ideas,
which I think he's right about,

00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:38.691
he doesn't run with it very
far, but the emergence of the

00:22:38.691 --> 00:22:42.463
nation's state system,
the rule of law,

00:22:42.463 --> 00:22:48.470
the existence of well
formalized property rights,

00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:54.962
all that stuff is pretty
powerful, and the western world

00:22:54.962 --> 00:23:01.810
was the initial focal point of
the Westphalian nation state

00:23:01.810 --> 00:23:03.108
system.
 

00:23:03.108 --> 00:23:07.496
Clark is at pains to show that
that by itself isn't enough an

00:23:07.496 --> 00:23:08.519
explanation.
 

00:23:08.519 --> 00:23:13.132
In general, no one should
expect one story to explain the

00:23:13.132 --> 00:23:15.848
evolution of capitalist wealth.
 

00:23:15.848 --> 00:23:20.718
This is way too complex a
story--way to complex a

00:23:20.718 --> 00:23:25.788
phenomenon for simple theories
to carry the day.

00:23:25.788 --> 00:23:30.567
A special case of that would be
wealth-maximizing law as

00:23:30.567 --> 00:23:33.608
illustrated a week ago in
Ghen v.

00:23:33.608 --> 00:23:35.519
Rich or in U.S.
 

00:23:35.519 --> 00:23:35.693
v.
 

00:23:35.693 --> 00:23:40.558
Cosby, or any of hundreds
of legal precedence.

00:23:40.558 --> 00:23:47.650
Clark also briefly,
toward the end of the book,

00:23:47.650 --> 00:23:50.930
takes up the work of a guy
named Kenneth Pomeranz,

00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:54.913
and Pomeranz has a book called
The Great Divergence

00:23:54.913 --> 00:23:59.092
which asks the question,
why did the--well he begins

00:23:59.092 --> 00:24:04.184
with the proposition that from a
social and economic point of

00:24:04.184 --> 00:24:06.809
view,
China and Japan,

00:24:06.809 --> 00:24:11.808
both look a lot like Europe in
about 1800.

00:24:11.808 --> 00:24:16.086
There's lots to quibble with in
that generalization but it's not

00:24:16.086 --> 00:24:16.630
crazy.
 

00:24:16.630 --> 00:24:20.403
Then he says,
"Well, Europe takes off

00:24:20.403 --> 00:24:25.559
well over a century ahead of
those Asian countries,"

00:24:25.559 --> 00:24:28.230
and he wants to know why.
 

00:24:28.230 --> 00:24:32.538
His thesis is it has to do with
natural resources.

00:24:32.538 --> 00:24:36.367
In particular,
that large population centers

00:24:36.367 --> 00:24:41.709
like the cities of England were
located close to large energy

00:24:41.709 --> 00:24:46.784
resources such as the coal
mining areas of the Midlands in

00:24:46.784 --> 00:24:49.009
the United Kingdom.
 

00:24:49.009 --> 00:24:54.838
Also of almost equal importance
for Pomeranz,

00:24:54.838 --> 00:25:01.417
access to vast agricultural
land in the form of North

00:25:01.417 --> 00:25:05.481
America,
and that about 1800 was the

00:25:05.481 --> 00:25:11.323
time when the exploitation of
the largely empty continent in

00:25:11.323 --> 00:25:17.558
the United States was feeding
resources into Western Europe.

00:25:17.558 --> 00:25:20.490
There's some plausibility in
those ideas.

00:25:20.490 --> 00:25:26.798
Then Clark talks about multiple
equilibrium theories,

00:25:26.798 --> 00:25:33.490
and the idea here is--think of
time passing that way,

00:25:33.490 --> 00:25:36.890
and standard of living or
productivity going this way.

00:25:36.890 --> 00:25:42.825
The idea is that a country
could climb this small hill and

00:25:42.825 --> 00:25:46.744
get stuck here,
and then there would be some

00:25:46.744 --> 00:25:51.088
exogenous shock,
some huge event outside the

00:25:51.088 --> 00:25:55.630
economic system,
which would allow it to pass

00:25:55.630 --> 00:26:01.210
from that equilibrium to a new
equilibrium on top of the taller

00:26:01.210 --> 00:26:01.930
hill.
 

00:26:01.930 --> 00:26:10.065
The world demographic
transition is such a story,

00:26:10.065 --> 00:26:15.318
and not a crazy story at all.
 

00:26:15.318 --> 00:26:20.750
The notion that the falling
death rate created by better

00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:24.460
public health,
probably more than any single

00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:26.480
factor,
by clean water,

00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:31.894
and elementary vaccinations,
but clean water probably above

00:26:31.894 --> 00:26:36.028
all else,
and the eventual adjustment of

00:26:36.028 --> 00:26:42.259
the birthrate to that so that
you go from high birthrate,

00:26:42.259 --> 00:26:44.960
high death rate,
short lives,

00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:49.318
to low birthrate,
low death rate, long lives.

00:26:49.318 --> 00:26:57.932
That by itself is a--is I think
without question a powerful

00:26:57.932 --> 00:27:06.843
element in the story wherever a
nation state society has gone

00:27:06.843 --> 00:27:10.108
from poor to rich.
 

00:27:10.108 --> 00:27:15.410
Then the endogenous growth
theories,

00:27:15.410 --> 00:27:22.243
and these are--the idea here is
that something happens inside

00:27:22.243 --> 00:27:27.368
the economy that creates a
dynamic change,

00:27:27.368 --> 00:27:34.730
and that dynamic change leads
to mass affluence.

00:27:34.730 --> 00:27:40.313
I think there's a lot in this
idea which of course is not

00:27:40.313 --> 00:27:41.308
Clark's.
 

00:27:41.308 --> 00:27:43.990
Clark is merely cataloguing
other people's ideas.

00:27:43.990 --> 00:27:48.980
The--does anybody recognize
either of these two handsome

00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:50.068
gentlemen?
 

00:27:50.068 --> 00:27:53.769
I'd prefer the haircut on the
left.

00:27:53.769 --> 00:28:03.019
This is Joseph Schumpeter,
and this is F.A. Hayek.

00:28:03.019 --> 00:28:10.875
Each of them had an idea of
about market societies that has

00:28:10.875 --> 00:28:15.210
to be central to our thinking.
 

00:28:15.210 --> 00:28:18.709
In Schumpeter's case it was
creative destruction,

00:28:18.709 --> 00:28:22.865
and I'm told by the teaching
fellows that most of you knew

00:28:22.865 --> 00:28:25.490
that quite well on the mid-term.
 

00:28:25.490 --> 00:28:32.972
Creative destruction is a way
of reshuffling the deck

00:28:32.972 --> 00:28:43.009
economically at short intervals,
so that, looking back at this

00:28:43.009 --> 00:28:46.773
story,
so that sitting still on this

00:28:46.773 --> 00:28:50.385
hill,
is difficult for any given firm

00:28:50.385 --> 00:28:55.772
and arguably impossible for
society at large once you're

00:28:55.772 --> 00:28:59.298
into a capitalist market
economy.

00:28:59.298 --> 00:29:07.630
One way to diagram that
is--this diagram we have,

00:29:07.630 --> 00:29:12.278
the capital invested in a given
kind of product or production,

00:29:12.278 --> 00:29:18.848
rising from left to right,
and the productivity of that

00:29:18.848 --> 00:29:23.348
capital rising from bottom to
top,

00:29:23.348 --> 00:29:29.185
and each of these curves is a
production function representing

00:29:29.185 --> 00:29:34.449
a technology and a way of
organizing people and handling

00:29:34.449 --> 00:29:35.980
information.
 

00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:42.808
The idea would be that change
occurs in the sequence 1,

00:29:42.808 --> 00:29:47.916
2,3, 4,5, 6 here where there's
a process of climbing to the

00:29:47.916 --> 00:29:52.759
right as we go to more
capital-intensive production,

00:29:52.759 --> 00:29:58.015
more capital per worker,
and then while Tal is doing

00:29:58.015 --> 00:30:02.079
that,
Jennifer is saying,

00:30:02.079 --> 00:30:07.067
"Well no,
we should reorganize this

00:30:07.067 --> 00:30:07.970
entirely.
 

00:30:07.970 --> 00:30:09.588
We should use a different
technology,

00:30:09.588 --> 00:30:13.509
a different method of
attracting investments,

00:30:13.509 --> 00:30:17.967
a different method of
compensating employees,"

00:30:17.967 --> 00:30:23.136
and she shifts to the lower end
of three and then that gets

00:30:23.136 --> 00:30:27.253
carried to here,
and then a similar shift to the

00:30:27.253 --> 00:30:30.440
blue production function and
then up that,

00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:36.961
and so a kind of zigzag story
of change where people compete

00:30:36.961 --> 00:30:43.153
not within one production
function but between production

00:30:43.153 --> 00:30:50.558
functions and a chaotic pattern
of creative destruction occurs.

00:30:50.558 --> 00:30:54.182
What makes it creative is that
it is ultimately an upward

00:30:54.182 --> 00:30:55.930
movement in productivity.
 

00:30:55.930 --> 00:31:02.337
A version of that story is in
Clark but he doesn't really

00:31:02.337 --> 00:31:08.059
think in the dynamic way that
Schumpeter and Hayek,

00:31:08.059 --> 00:31:10.118
and others do.
 

00:31:10.118 --> 00:31:15.138
Hayek's story is the one about
the creative potential of a free

00:31:15.138 --> 00:31:18.212
society,
which I think you had a memo to

00:31:18.212 --> 00:31:22.967
write about,
and the notion there is that

00:31:22.967 --> 00:31:26.868
social learning will accrue.
 

00:31:26.868 --> 00:31:30.368
That the society at large will
have a higher learning rate than

00:31:30.368 --> 00:31:36.147
any individual within it,
and that as each of us goes

00:31:36.147 --> 00:31:43.829
about her or his work,
we are spewing off insights for

00:31:43.829 --> 00:31:44.848
others.
 

00:31:44.848 --> 00:31:47.970
Both when we succeed and when
we fail.

00:31:47.970 --> 00:31:51.420
When we succeed people will
copy our ideas.

00:31:51.420 --> 00:31:56.381
When we fail people will know
an idea not to try,

00:31:56.381 --> 00:32:01.548
and that over time society
actually smartens up.

00:32:01.548 --> 00:32:05.834
If you look at the first
chapter in the assignment for

00:32:05.834 --> 00:32:09.954
today in Clark,
he has all the factors of

00:32:09.954 --> 00:32:15.049
growth, as he conceives them,
in a very simplified model,

00:32:15.049 --> 00:32:17.340
and the residual--
the residual,

00:32:17.340 --> 00:32:20.910
which accounts for about half
the variance,

00:32:20.910 --> 00:32:25.317
it's most natural
interpretation is it is social

00:32:25.317 --> 00:32:26.348
learning.
 

00:32:26.348 --> 00:32:31.153
It isn't the specific capital
embodied in a given workers

00:32:31.153 --> 00:32:34.681
education,
or in the factory plant and

00:32:34.681 --> 00:32:40.220
equipment with which that worker
is supplied by an employer,

00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:46.261
but in the less tangible forms
of social knowledge which the

00:32:46.261 --> 00:32:48.720
society is generating.
 

00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:53.258
And Hayek's idea,
then, is that over time social

00:32:53.258 --> 00:32:57.410
learning makes the whole system
smarter,

00:32:57.410 --> 00:33:01.376
taken as a whole,
and that learning to navigate

00:33:01.376 --> 00:33:04.811
unfamiliar information,
which arguably,

00:33:04.811 --> 00:33:08.630
would be something you're all
doing right now,

00:33:08.630 --> 00:33:13.826
becomes not only an advantage
to the individual but to the

00:33:13.826 --> 00:33:15.558
society at large.
 

00:33:15.558 --> 00:33:22.040
Well the most glaring omission
in Clark, in talking about the

00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:28.740
surge of wealth in the west,
is the joint stock corporation.

00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:33.695
The joint stock corporation
goes back of course many

00:33:33.695 --> 00:33:38.240
centuries,
but the kind of joint stock

00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:44.680
corporation which has become
dominant in the world,

00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:48.308
goes back only to about the
middle of the 1800s.

00:33:48.308 --> 00:33:54.836
In the UK it's dated to The
Corporation Act of 1862,

00:33:54.836 --> 00:33:56.500
in the U.S.
 

00:33:56.500 --> 00:33:59.689
I think you'd probably say
somewhere in the 1840s it

00:33:59.689 --> 00:34:00.940
becomes important.
 

00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:05.230
You can find legal traces of it
much earlier in both cases,

00:34:05.230 --> 00:34:09.228
but it gets to be a big deal in
the middle years of the

00:34:09.228 --> 00:34:10.929
nineteenth century.
 

00:34:10.929 --> 00:34:17.983
As we saw with the reading from
Alfred Chandler,

00:34:17.983 --> 00:34:25.489
the rise of the large-scale
railroad in the U.S.

00:34:25.489 --> 00:34:30.463
provoked the creation of the
equity and bond markets in New

00:34:30.463 --> 00:34:34.757
York,
and the feverish development of

00:34:34.757 --> 00:34:40.693
joint stock corporations in
virtually every field of

00:34:40.693 --> 00:34:43.369
endeavor thereafter.
 

00:34:43.369 --> 00:34:51.038
These slides--I'm going to show
a series of proprietary slides

00:34:51.038 --> 00:34:55.690
constructed by Ibbotson
Associates.

00:34:55.690 --> 00:35:00.038
Ibbotson Associates is named
for Roger Ibbotson at The School

00:35:00.038 --> 00:35:01.559
of Management here.
 

00:35:01.559 --> 00:35:09.652
Ibbotson became filthy rich by
being the first one to

00:35:09.652 --> 00:35:17.588
systematically compile,
analyze, and sell long trend

00:35:17.588 --> 00:35:22.570
data about stocks and bonds.
 

00:35:22.570 --> 00:35:27.123
It's only because he likes to
teach that he bothers to

00:35:27.123 --> 00:35:28.070
continue.
 

00:35:28.070 --> 00:35:34.260
The time scale here is 1925 to
more or less the present.

00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:44.340
The earnings of various classes
of assets are--

00:35:44.340 --> 00:35:47.404
I've traced here,
beginning in this case with

00:35:47.404 --> 00:35:50.400
treasury bills issued by the
government,

00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:54.289
and as safe as the government
is.

00:35:54.289 --> 00:36:01.047
Then municipal bonds,
government bonds of other

00:36:01.047 --> 00:36:04.519
kinds,
corporate bonds,

00:36:04.519 --> 00:36:12.449
so this would be debt taken on
by a corporation and it might

00:36:12.449 --> 00:36:15.478
be--
they might be junk bonds if the

00:36:15.478 --> 00:36:19.251
corporation is a little risky
and they might be blue chip

00:36:19.251 --> 00:36:20.329
bonds if not.
 

00:36:20.329 --> 00:36:27.289
Then this is--the blue curve is
an amalgam of stock returns,

00:36:27.289 --> 00:36:33.840
and in every case we start with
$1 in 1925 and keep investing

00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:37.603
the money--
the way these charts are

00:36:37.603 --> 00:36:42.876
generated is we assume that
every dollar of dividend is

00:36:42.876 --> 00:36:48.360
plowed back,
and that we don't pay any taxes.

00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:53.849
This would sort of be Yale that
we're charting.

00:36:53.849 --> 00:36:58.025
You and I wouldn't quite have
the same tax privilege Yale has,

00:36:58.025 --> 00:37:01.585
and the most striking thing
there is--what's the most

00:37:01.585 --> 00:37:04.050
striking thing about that chart?
 

00:37:04.050 --> 00:37:09.697
First of all there is some
magic in compound interest,

00:37:09.697 --> 00:37:10.550
right?
 

00:37:10.550 --> 00:37:14.617
You can just leave your money
to grow, it really does

00:37:14.617 --> 00:37:16.260
eventually do that.
 

00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:19.210
How about the blue curve versus
the others?

00:37:19.210 --> 00:37:32.250
Pretty startling--we've got to
get somebody else--yes Tal.

00:37:32.250 --> 00:37:33.882
Student:  There seems to
be a rather large equity

00:37:33.882 --> 00:37:34.179
premium.
 

00:37:34.179 --> 00:37:38.043
What I mean by that is that
there seems to be excess returns

00:37:38.043 --> 00:37:41.581
if you put your money in stocks
versus any of the other

00:37:41.581 --> 00:37:44.210
categories,
treasuries, corporate bonds.

00:37:44.210 --> 00:37:47.831
I mean, you're obviously taking
on more risk in stocks versus

00:37:47.831 --> 00:37:51.123
the other categories,
certainly more than treasury

00:37:51.123 --> 00:37:53.273
bills,
but you could possibly argue

00:37:53.273 --> 00:37:56.346
that the difference in risk
doesn't seem as great as a

00:37:56.346 --> 00:37:58.840
difference in returns over the
long run.

00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:01.250
Prof: Okay.
 

00:38:01.250 --> 00:38:04.748
What's the--the equity premium
is the punch line here,

00:38:04.748 --> 00:38:05.539
well said.
 

00:38:05.539 --> 00:38:10.211
What's the standard way one
might manage the risk of a

00:38:10.211 --> 00:38:11.268
portfolio?
 

00:38:11.268 --> 00:38:12.840
Student:  You could
diversify.

00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:16.353
Prof: Okay,
so we wouldn't put all our

00:38:16.353 --> 00:38:20.422
money in mining stocks or in--
even in Apple,

00:38:20.422 --> 00:38:26.583
which is right now one of the
most expensive stocks in the

00:38:26.583 --> 00:38:31.949
universe,
but the equity premium is huge.

00:38:31.949 --> 00:38:36.900
Look here what happens--this is
1925, the Depression is here,

00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:41.110
the great crash is here,
these people got jolted.

00:38:41.110 --> 00:38:45.637
Of course the temptation when
that happens to you is to

00:38:45.637 --> 00:38:50.246
imagine that it's going to go
right to the middle of the

00:38:50.246 --> 00:38:54.570
earth,
and therefore to sell at this

00:38:54.570 --> 00:38:58.717
point,
which lots and lots of people

00:38:58.717 --> 00:39:04.909
did, and of course the effect
was to ruin their wealth.

00:39:04.909 --> 00:39:07.489
Let's take another set of these.
 

00:39:07.489 --> 00:39:13.896
We let inflation go unnoticed
in that one and here we'll show

00:39:13.896 --> 00:39:20.606
inflation by the red curve,
and then the T-Bills,

00:39:20.606 --> 00:39:26.059
government bonds,
large company stocks,

00:39:26.059 --> 00:39:32.030
small company stocks and you
get a huge premium there.

00:39:32.030 --> 00:39:39.498
Now the--back to the question
of the accumulation of mass

00:39:39.498 --> 00:39:46.315
affluence;
the power of large enterprise

00:39:46.315 --> 00:39:54.768
to generate enormous wealth over
long periods;

00:39:54.768 --> 00:39:58.090
this is a seventy-five,
eighty, eighty-five year period

00:39:58.090 --> 00:40:02.965
we're looking at,
but patient--money patiently

00:40:02.965 --> 00:40:10.128
invested in joint stock
corporations is a solid strategy

00:40:10.128 --> 00:40:17.552
for the accumulation of wealth
within a given household or

00:40:17.552 --> 00:40:21.329
institutional portfolio.
 

00:40:21.329 --> 00:40:26.570
It's not anywhere near the
sexiest or the fastest way,

00:40:26.570 --> 00:40:32.320
but it is one of the most solid
ways,

00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:38.670
and the only conclusion I want
to get out of this is that in

00:40:38.670 --> 00:40:45.344
talking about economic takeoff
and the sustained growth in mass

00:40:45.344 --> 00:40:49.005
affluence,
companies, joint stock

00:40:49.005 --> 00:40:52.260
companies with limited
liability,

00:40:52.260 --> 00:40:54.230
are a big part of that.
 

00:40:54.230 --> 00:40:58.340
Third and last.
 

00:40:58.340 --> 00:41:03.143
With--remember the variable
here is gross domestic product

00:41:03.143 --> 00:41:04.239
per capita.
 

00:41:04.239 --> 00:41:11.500
Part of that has to do with the
propensity to consume.

00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:16.780
In the Posner book about what
went wrong with the mortgage

00:41:16.780 --> 00:41:20.581
markets,
Keynes, Lord Keynes is

00:41:20.581 --> 00:41:25.260
mentioned, and Keynesian
economics,

00:41:25.260 --> 00:41:30.929
which are directed to the
question of stabilizing mass

00:41:30.929 --> 00:41:37.456
demand for products so that the
economy keeps going around and

00:41:37.456 --> 00:41:41.599
around,
is an important element.

00:41:41.599 --> 00:41:45.246
Well the joint stock
corporation was,

00:41:45.246 --> 00:41:49.400
from its birth,
really good at selling.

00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:52.286
The move, which would be called
forward integration,

00:41:52.286 --> 00:41:55.570
were not just going to make
cigarettes, we're going to sell

00:41:55.570 --> 00:41:56.420
cigarettes.
 

00:41:56.420 --> 00:41:59.510
We're not just going to make
soap;

00:41:59.510 --> 00:42:00.530
we're going to sell soap.
 

00:42:00.530 --> 00:42:01.789
We're not just going to make
cars;

00:42:01.789 --> 00:42:03.559
we're going to sell them.
 

00:42:03.559 --> 00:42:07.559
That forward integration--I'm
going to without comment now

00:42:07.559 --> 00:42:11.980
just show you 20 slides from the
middle decades of the twentieth

00:42:11.980 --> 00:42:16.119
century and then we'll stop
briefly and segue to next--

00:42:16.119 --> 00:42:17.469
our next meeting.
 

00:42:17.469 --> 00:42:20.780
Some of these are a little
pernicious.

00:42:20.780 --> 00:42:23.050
This one is not.
 

00:42:23.050 --> 00:42:40.813
The--a repeated trope is using
products to solve marital

00:42:40.813 --> 00:42:48.195
problems,
and the large glove compartment

00:42:48.195 --> 00:42:54.867
on this Mercury will solve the
marital problem between these

00:42:54.867 --> 00:42:55.659
two.
 

00:42:55.659 --> 00:43:00.844
When my grandfather died and I
was seventeen,

00:43:00.844 --> 00:43:07.681
I inherited a Mercury from him,
it lasted one year before I

00:43:07.681 --> 00:43:09.449
crashed it.
 

00:43:09.449 --> 00:43:47.969
"Quiet substance"--a
series of Palmolive's here.

00:43:47.969 --> 00:43:50.920
They all have to do with men
and women.

00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:54.969
Women are the sales target.
 

00:43:54.969 --> 00:43:57.630
Does Palmolive soap exist still?
 

00:43:57.630 --> 00:44:32.429
Does anybody still use it?
 

00:44:32.429 --> 00:44:42.050
That's pretty nasty stuff right?
 

00:44:42.050 --> 00:44:43.670
This is rouge not soap now.
 

00:44:43.670 --> 00:45:25.230
 
 

00:45:25.230 --> 00:45:26.820
You get the gist of it.
 

00:45:26.820 --> 00:45:34.820
In the consumer culture that's
embodied in these,

00:45:34.820 --> 00:45:39.750
and which is powerfully
represented all around us,

00:45:39.750 --> 00:45:44.309
we live in a very consumption
oriented culture,

00:45:44.309 --> 00:45:55.239
is arguably a misleadingly
favorable aspect of wealth.

00:45:55.239 --> 00:46:00.871
That is, an awful lot--if you
think about those ads and how

00:46:00.871 --> 00:46:04.985
silly it seems,
with seventy years hindsight,

00:46:04.985 --> 00:46:09.230
that using Palmolive soap will
save your marriage--

00:46:09.230 --> 00:46:13.389
I often guess that it didn't
save a single marriage--

00:46:13.389 --> 00:46:19.940
that whole angle of kind of the
Hucksterish aspect of a

00:46:19.940 --> 00:46:25.090
capitalist society,
can give one pause.

00:46:25.090 --> 00:46:30.512
Now I'd like you to come to
class Wednesday having thought a

00:46:30.512 --> 00:46:36.304
little about a country and what
5% of its GDP would amount to in

00:46:36.304 --> 00:46:40.822
dollars,
and if you need to look that up

00:46:40.822 --> 00:46:42.860
you can Google it.
 

00:46:42.860 --> 00:46:47.893
The easiest Google is CIA
Factbook, but the World Bank

00:46:47.893 --> 00:46:50.650
will give you the data too.
 

00:46:50.650 --> 00:46:54.407
The World Bank or the WTO,
there are all kinds of

00:46:54.407 --> 00:46:57.539
organizations that produce these
data.

00:46:57.539 --> 00:47:03.344
Pick a country and think about
5% and think about how you would

00:47:03.344 --> 00:47:09.056
deploy the 5% if you wanted to
maximize the expected wealth of

00:47:09.056 --> 00:47:13.469
that society over,
let's say, a twenty-year future.

00:47:13.469 --> 00:47:19.099
The reading is the more policy
oriented part of de Soto,

00:47:19.099 --> 00:47:24.429
and it should in some ways
guide and support your thinking,

00:47:24.429 --> 00:47:27.440
although you surely want to
think well beyond de Soto's

00:47:27.440 --> 00:47:28.110
framework.
 

00:47:28.110 --> 00:47:30.500
So I'll see you on Wednesday.
 

00:47:30.500 --> 00:47:36.000

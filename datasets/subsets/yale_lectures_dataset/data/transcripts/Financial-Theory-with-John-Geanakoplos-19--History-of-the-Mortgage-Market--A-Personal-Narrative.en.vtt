Prof: Hi,
this is John Geanakoplos again.

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:08.795
Here to give a lecture,
that I gave one evening,

00:00:08.795 --> 00:00:10.680
that we couldn't record.
 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.955
So I'm going to try and
reproduce the lecture as

00:00:12.955 --> 00:00:14.020
faithfully as I can.
 

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:17.860
And I think it's a historical
lecture.

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:19.090
I hope you find it interesting.
 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:21.750
It's about the history of the
mortgage market.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.822
And I call it a personal
history because by some

00:00:24.822 --> 00:00:28.941
accident, I participated at many
of the key points in the recent

00:00:28.941 --> 00:00:31.230
history of the mortgage market.
 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.040
So I started off in 1989.
 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.280
I was professor here at Yale.
 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.430
I was a mathematical economist.
 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.849
I thought of myself as using
mathematics to study economics

00:00:43.849 --> 00:00:48.497
and staying really pretty much
as far from the real world as I

00:00:48.497 --> 00:00:49.260
could.
 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.948
But for some reason,
I decided that I wanted to see

00:00:51.948 --> 00:00:53.830
what was going on on Wall
Street.

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.092
The most interesting
mathematical modeling of that

00:00:57.092 --> 00:00:59.490
day was being done on Wall
Street.

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:02.570
And mathematical modeling and
finance, that is in economics.

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:03.350
And so I decided.
 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:04.578
why not go see it?
 

00:01:04.578 --> 00:01:08.938
And so I visited a bunch of
investment banks.

00:01:08.938 --> 00:01:12.210
A number of my friends,
including one from Yale,

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.299
had worked at Goldman Sachs.
 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:15.989
So that was the natural thing
to do.

00:01:15.989 --> 00:01:21.480
But, I had a little cousin who
had just been hired recently,

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.200
a little bit before that,
at Kidder Peabody,

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.784
which was sort of the number
seventh investment bank at the

00:01:27.784 --> 00:01:29.610
time,
in terms of size.

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.754
And he introduced me to the
fellow, Ed Cerullo,

00:01:33.754 --> 00:01:36.910
who ran fixed income at the
time.

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:39.224
And they persuaded me that it
would be much more interesting

00:01:39.224 --> 00:01:41.524
to go to Kidder,
Peabody and to talk to people

00:01:41.524 --> 00:01:44.426
like Ed Cerullo,
than go to Goldman Sachs and be

00:01:44.426 --> 00:01:46.800
one of a hundred visiting
professors.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.724
So I decided that the firm was
a little bit smaller,

00:01:48.724 --> 00:01:49.819
but I would see more of it.
 

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:51.970
And why not do something a
little bit different?

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.169
So they never had an academic
visitor, I think,

00:01:54.169 --> 00:01:55.890
like me spend a year there
before.

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.550
So I went in 1989 to 1990.
 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.769
And while I was there I talked
a lot to Ed Cerullo and to the

00:02:02.769 --> 00:02:04.968
traders and to a bunch of other
people.

00:02:04.968 --> 00:02:08.550
And at the end of the my
sabbatical,

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.445
Ed Cerullo came to me and he
said, you know I've come to

00:02:11.445 --> 00:02:14.554
realize that our fixed income
research department isn't very

00:02:14.554 --> 00:02:15.449
mathematical.
 

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:19.300
Why don't you hire a research
department for me?

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:20.598
And I'll help you along.
 

00:02:20.598 --> 00:02:22.818
But, you find the people,
you know the subject,

00:02:22.818 --> 00:02:25.818
you can judge,
your business is judging people

00:02:25.818 --> 00:02:28.363
doing research,
why don't you hire me a

00:02:28.363 --> 00:02:29.590
research department?
 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.995
So I hired him a research
department, which ultimately

00:02:32.995 --> 00:02:34.280
grew to 75 people.
 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.878
And I returned to Yale.
 

00:02:36.878 --> 00:02:39.400
And after I got back to Yale,
he called me up and he said,

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.440
now that you've hired the
research department,

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.160
you have heads of all these
different groups,

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.449
why don't you run the research
department?

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:49.508
You can do it from Yale,
as a consultant.

00:02:49.508 --> 00:02:53.360
And so I became the head of
fixed income research at Kidder

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.690
Peabody from Yale.
 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.258
And it was quite an experience.
 

00:02:57.258 --> 00:03:00.098
I hadn't realized,
when I accepted the job,

00:03:00.098 --> 00:03:02.938
just how many complications
would arise.

00:03:02.938 --> 00:03:05.399
How many people would get job
offers from other places and

00:03:05.399 --> 00:03:06.090
want to leave.
 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.288
And how many models wouldn't
work.

00:03:08.288 --> 00:03:11.008
And then there'd have to be a
wild scramble to fix it.

00:03:11.008 --> 00:03:14.217
But anyway, that placed me at
an investment bank,

00:03:14.217 --> 00:03:17.894
that would become one of the
key players in the mortgage

00:03:17.894 --> 00:03:18.628
market.
 

00:03:18.628 --> 00:03:20.490
Now in the mortgage market,
well who are the players?

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:22.639
They are the homeowners you all
know about.

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:25.598
They are the banks who are
giving mortgage loans.

00:03:25.598 --> 00:03:28.829
But then there are a number of
other players that are invisible

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:31.276
to much of the public,
which really dominate the

00:03:31.276 --> 00:03:31.848
market.
 

00:03:31.848 --> 00:03:34.247
There's the government
agencies, Fannie Mae and Freddie

00:03:34.247 --> 00:03:35.889
Mac, which you'll hear a lot
about.

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:38.895
There are the investment banks,
like Kidder Peabody and Goldman

00:03:38.895 --> 00:03:40.348
Sachs and a bunch of others.
 

00:03:40.348 --> 00:03:43.848
There are the hedge funds and
there are other investors.

00:03:43.848 --> 00:03:48.449
And this group of people
creates a gigantic hierarchy,

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:52.268
an invisible market,
that's on the same size,

00:03:52.268 --> 00:03:55.740
the same scale,
as the stock market.

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:58.865
So I think in that time,
1989,1990, if you'd asked

00:03:58.865 --> 00:04:02.627
anyone in America practically,
what's an important financial

00:04:02.627 --> 00:04:03.330
market?
 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.218
They would have said,
the stock market.

00:04:05.218 --> 00:04:07.419
What's another important
financial market?

00:04:07.419 --> 00:04:08.810
Corporate bond market.
 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:09.849
What's another one?
 

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:14.509
Well, foreign exchange market.
 

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:15.319
What's another one?
 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:16.759
Options market.
 

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:20.449
I don't think anyone would have
said the mortgage market.

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:24.754
Or at least they wouldn't have
said it very early on in their

00:04:24.754 --> 00:04:27.480
list of important financial
markets.

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.497
But in fact,
as I'm going to try and tell

00:04:29.497 --> 00:04:32.509
you during this class,
the mortgage market is not only

00:04:32.509 --> 00:04:34.769
on the same scale as the stock
market,

00:04:34.769 --> 00:04:37.408
but actually quite a bit more
complicated than the stock

00:04:37.408 --> 00:04:37.839
market.
 

00:04:37.839 --> 00:04:39.709
More mathematical than the
stock market.

00:04:39.709 --> 00:04:42.016
And in some ways,
more interesting than the stock

00:04:42.016 --> 00:04:42.449
market.
 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:45.091
And as we'll see at the end of
the course, it was the mortgage

00:04:45.091 --> 00:04:47.560
market that led to the greatest
crisis we've had since the

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:48.209
depression.
 

00:04:48.209 --> 00:04:51.146
And in fact,
caused several similar crises

00:04:51.146 --> 00:04:52.149
before that.
 

00:04:52.149 --> 00:04:56.420
So mortgages appear at the
bottom.

00:04:56.420 --> 00:05:00.430
You have homeowners living in
their houses who need to borrow

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.370
the money to buy the house.
 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:04.713
Before they can live in the
house they have to get the money

00:05:04.713 --> 00:05:05.470
to buy the house.
 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:07.680
So they borrow the money by
taking out a mortgage.

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.886
And it's a bank or a thrift or
somebody like that who lends the

00:05:10.886 --> 00:05:11.300
money.
 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.420
That's the first step.
 

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:18.074
So a mortgage is just a promise
to pay the loan back over a long

00:05:18.074 --> 00:05:21.620
period of time using your house
as collateral.

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:24.663
An important part of mortgages
is that you have an option to

00:05:24.663 --> 00:05:25.850
pre pay the mortgage.
 

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:27.610
I mean, what if you move?
 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:29.778
The mortgage is,
say, a 30-year promise.

00:05:29.778 --> 00:05:31.790
And after three years,
you might want to move.

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:34.345
So, if you're gone from the
house, the house can no longer

00:05:34.345 --> 00:05:36.990
serve as collateral because you
don't live in it anymore.

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:39.620
So there has to be some way of
getting out of the mortgage.

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:41.899
And so there's an option to pre
pay it.

00:05:41.899 --> 00:05:45.002
Now, in the United States,
that option can be used even if

00:05:45.002 --> 00:05:46.310
you stay in the house.
 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:50.336
And it turns out to be one of
the more problematic aspects of

00:05:50.336 --> 00:05:51.680
valuing mortgages.
 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:54.370
And one of the most interesting
aspects of valuing mortgages.

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:56.060
We'll come to that later.
 

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:59.153
So this idea of a mortgage,
those three ideas,

00:05:59.153 --> 00:06:02.726
were already known to the
Babylonians more than 3,000

00:06:02.726 --> 00:06:03.689
years ago.
 

00:06:03.689 --> 00:06:05.790
So the mortgage is not a recent
invention.

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:10.528
It wasn't invented after the
industrial revolution.

00:06:10.528 --> 00:06:15.100
It was invented more than 3,000
years ago near the Middle East.

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:19.507
So, it's stayed pretty much the
same for most of those 3,000

00:06:19.507 --> 00:06:23.468
years until the 1930s when the
amortizing mortgage was

00:06:23.468 --> 00:06:24.439
invented.
 

00:06:24.439 --> 00:06:28.120
So what happened in the 1930s,
that was the time of the Great

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:32.230
Depression and farmers had lots
of mortgages and they would owe,

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:35.069
$7.00 a year,
say, as their interest payment.

00:06:35.069 --> 00:06:38.661
And at the end of 10 or 15
years, they'd have to pay $107,

00:06:38.661 --> 00:06:41.370
that is they make their
interest payment.

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:43.379
And they pay back the balance.
 

00:06:43.379 --> 00:06:44.910
What's called now a balloon
payment.

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:46.959
That's how a typical bond works.
 

00:06:46.959 --> 00:06:50.583
Well, of course when things got
really bad, a lot of them

00:06:50.583 --> 00:06:51.360
defaulted.
 

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:54.026
And naturally,
they chose to default just

00:06:54.026 --> 00:06:55.759
before the $107 payment.
 

00:06:55.759 --> 00:06:59.146
So seeing that,
mortgage lenders decided that

00:06:59.146 --> 00:07:03.762
it would be much safer to make a
flat mortgage loan where the

00:07:03.762 --> 00:07:07.730
payment was say,
$8.00 a year for all of thirty

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:08.278
years.
 

00:07:08.278 --> 00:07:10.841
Now, you pay a little bit more
each year for 29 years,

00:07:10.841 --> 00:07:13.500
but then you continue to pay
the $8.00 the 30th year.

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:15.326
But you see,
if you add up all the extra

00:07:15.326 --> 00:07:17.810
payments and you realize that
there's discounting,

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:21.055
the $107 way off in the end
isn't really that much money

00:07:21.055 --> 00:07:23.180
when looked at from the
beginning.

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:27.072
And so by paying $8.00 every
year, you can get the same

00:07:27.072 --> 00:07:31.182
present discounted value of
paying $7.00 29 years and $107

00:07:31.182 --> 00:07:32.480
the 30th year.
 

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:34.000
So that's called the amortizing
mortgage.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.584
It makes the lender much safer
because after a bunch of years

00:07:37.584 --> 00:07:40.093
have gone by,
the house presumably has gone

00:07:40.093 --> 00:07:41.050
up in value.
 

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:44.170
Or even if it hasn't gone up in
value, the remaining payments

00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:47.293
are much less because so many
have been made that the balance

00:07:47.293 --> 00:07:48.490
has been amortized.
 

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:51.435
And so actually to get out of
your mortgage,

00:07:51.435 --> 00:07:54.040
you need to pay less than $100
back.

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:56.711
So this amortizing mortgage is
something we're going to study

00:07:56.711 --> 00:07:58.360
mathematically in the next
lecture.

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:01.978
But now, I just mentioned that
was one of the big innovations,

00:08:01.978 --> 00:08:05.300
which made the mortgage market
much safer than before.

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:09.502
Well so things continued pretty
much the same from the 1930s all

00:08:09.502 --> 00:08:12.838
the way to the 1970s when we had
securitization.

00:08:12.838 --> 00:08:15.834
Like many of the great
financial innovations in

00:08:15.834 --> 00:08:19.089
history, this one was created by
the government.

00:08:19.089 --> 00:08:24.035
So Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac
were government Agencies They

00:08:24.035 --> 00:08:26.850
were created by the government.
 

00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:30.370
They then became eventually
separate from the government.

00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:33.702
But they were given the task,
they were created for the

00:08:33.702 --> 00:08:36.419
purpose, of making mortgage
pass-throughs.

00:08:36.419 --> 00:08:38.168
So we're in the 1970s.
 

00:08:38.168 --> 00:08:42.077
So mortgage pass-throughs are
the second tier of this

00:08:42.077 --> 00:08:42.980
hierarchy.
 

00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:45.850
So the banks who had lent the
mortgage, remember when you take

00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:48.720
out a mortgage as a homeowner,
you're selling your promise.

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:51.124
You're getting the money by
selling your promise to pay back

00:08:51.124 --> 00:08:51.450
later.
 

00:08:51.450 --> 00:08:53.769
So those promises are collected
by the banks.

00:08:53.769 --> 00:08:56.143
And instead of just sitting on
the promises,

00:08:56.143 --> 00:08:58.626
the banks now,
with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac

00:08:58.626 --> 00:09:01.940
could sell their promises to
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:05.413
And Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac
would put them together in

00:09:05.413 --> 00:09:08.080
gigantic pools called pass
through pools.

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:09.178
Why were they called
pass-throughs?

00:09:09.178 --> 00:09:12.711
Because the mortgage payments
the homeowners made would go to

00:09:12.711 --> 00:09:16.418
the banks and the banks would
just pass them on to the pools.

00:09:16.418 --> 00:09:20.090
And then the pools would
collect the money and pass that

00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:22.158
money on to the shareholders.
 

00:09:22.158 --> 00:09:26.250
So the ultimate lenders to the
homeowners are the people who

00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:29.370
buy shares in the Fannie and
Freddie pools.

00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:32.046
So the banks appear to the
homeowner to be lending the

00:09:32.046 --> 00:09:32.450
money.
 

00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:33.710
But actually,
they're not lending it all.

00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:35.168
They are the middleman.
 

00:09:35.168 --> 00:09:38.527
And so they collect the money
from the homeowner and they send

00:09:38.527 --> 00:09:41.553
it on to the actual lender,
who's the shareholder of the

00:09:41.553 --> 00:09:42.048
pool.
 

00:09:42.048 --> 00:09:44.509
And the banks are also the
servicer, really.

00:09:44.509 --> 00:09:47.620
They're getting paid a fee for
collecting the money and writing

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:50.230
threatening letters if the
homeowner stops paying.

00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:52.846
And as we'll see later,
throwing the homeowner out of

00:09:52.846 --> 00:09:54.908
his house if the homeowner
doesn't pay.

00:09:54.908 --> 00:09:59.648
So Fannie and Freddie played an
extraordinarily important role

00:09:59.648 --> 00:10:01.590
in the mortgage market.
 

00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:03.794
First of all,
not any mortgage could be sold

00:10:03.794 --> 00:10:04.769
into these pools.
 

00:10:04.769 --> 00:10:07.519
They had to meet strict
criteria.

00:10:07.519 --> 00:10:08.870
You had to have a good credit
rating.

00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:10.710
You had to have a job.
 

00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:19.467
You had to have all sorts of--
sorry about this,

00:10:19.467 --> 00:10:28.038
I'm going to have to shut off
my cell phone.

00:10:28.038 --> 00:10:31.164
So the loan to value of the
mortgage had to be,

00:10:31.164 --> 00:10:35.309
that is if the house is worth
$100, the loan could only be 80%

00:10:35.309 --> 00:10:35.990
of it.
 

00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:41.690
You had to have a record of the
job you had and so on.

00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:51.370
So this was very standardized
and very high performing loans.

00:10:51.370 --> 00:10:54.345
You could contrast with,
say, to the world that you

00:10:54.345 --> 00:10:57.500
might have seen in the movie
It's a Wonderful Life.

00:10:57.500 --> 00:10:59.445
So in the movie It's a
Wonderful Life,

00:10:59.445 --> 00:11:02.653
you remember Jimmy Stewart runs
a thrift and he makes mortgage

00:11:02.653 --> 00:11:03.178
loans.
 

00:11:03.178 --> 00:11:05.320
And people come to him and they
say we want a loan.

00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:08.528
And you know one guy comes and
says he wants a loan.

00:11:08.528 --> 00:11:10.966
Jimmy Stewart says,
well do you have any

00:11:10.966 --> 00:11:11.778
collateral?
 

00:11:11.778 --> 00:11:14.427
No, I haven't built the house
yet, you know I'm trying to

00:11:14.427 --> 00:11:15.278
build the house.
 

00:11:15.278 --> 00:11:18.149
Do you have a record of
employment?

00:11:18.149 --> 00:11:21.960
No, I just moved here,
I don't have a job yet.

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:24.580
Do you have someone who can
vouch for you?

00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:25.490
No.
 

00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:27.320
Do you have a credit rating?
 

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:27.860
No.
 

00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:29.840
There's no such thing as credit
rating.

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:32.966
So then Jimmy Stewart looks
into his eyes and realizes this

00:11:32.966 --> 00:11:35.500
is a good honest person and
gives him a loan.

00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:38.750
Well, that doesn't happen in
the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac

00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:39.200
pools.
 

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:41.440
They're very standardized
criterion.

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:45.187
And that guy,
Martini who got the loan from

00:11:45.187 --> 00:11:50.450
Jimmy Stewart would never have
gotten a conforming Fannie or

00:11:50.450 --> 00:11:53.928
Freddie loan in the 1980s or
1990s.

00:11:53.928 --> 00:11:56.030
Might have gotten one in the
2000s though,

00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:57.570
but we'll come back to that.
 

00:11:57.570 --> 00:12:01.745
So that kind of market is very
much like the kind of market in

00:12:01.745 --> 00:12:04.895
the Jimmy Stewart movie,
It's a Wonderful Life,

00:12:04.895 --> 00:12:07.428
that gets created in his
fantasy.

00:12:07.428 --> 00:12:09.864
Where you know,
the town gets taken over by the

00:12:09.864 --> 00:12:11.769
evil banker and that evil
banker,

00:12:11.769 --> 00:12:14.129
whose name I've forgotten at
the moment,

00:12:14.129 --> 00:12:17.408
but that evil banker basically
is creating the kind of loans,

00:12:17.408 --> 00:12:19.408
almost, that we're talking
about now.

00:12:19.408 --> 00:12:21.580
Everything's mechanized and
standardized.

00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:25.389
Of course with standardization
you get tremendous advantages.

00:12:25.389 --> 00:12:29.716
For one thing,
these loans being pooled

00:12:29.716 --> 00:12:35.980
together and being of the same
general good quality,

00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:38.818
they allow the lenders,
instead of lending to a bunch

00:12:38.818 --> 00:12:41.548
of homeowners in Peoria like the
bank would do,

00:12:41.548 --> 00:12:44.519
now all those Peoria loans are
stuck with a bunch of other

00:12:44.519 --> 00:12:47.750
loans from all over the country
in the same big Fannie pool.

00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:49.871
And so the lenders,
who are the shareholders,

00:12:49.871 --> 00:12:51.320
have diversified their risk.
 

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:53.950
If the big businesses in
Peoria, Illinois go under,

00:12:53.950 --> 00:12:56.528
it might be that all the
homeowners in Peoria will

00:12:56.528 --> 00:12:58.158
default on their mortgages.
 

00:12:58.158 --> 00:13:00.160
But not in the Fannie and
Freddie pools,

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:02.830
because those are loans from
all over the country.

00:13:02.830 --> 00:13:06.186
So it would have to be that
businesses all over the country

00:13:06.186 --> 00:13:08.558
went bad for those loans all to
go bad.

00:13:08.558 --> 00:13:10.857
So secondly,
if you're getting a whole pool

00:13:10.857 --> 00:13:13.812
and there's an automatic
criterion for getting into the

00:13:13.812 --> 00:13:15.532
pool,
you don't have to worry that

00:13:15.532 --> 00:13:17.835
you're getting the worst loans
or the cheatiest loans or

00:13:17.835 --> 00:13:18.379
something.
 

00:13:18.379 --> 00:13:20.285
You know the quality,
the general quality,

00:13:20.285 --> 00:13:21.168
of all the loans.
 

00:13:21.168 --> 00:13:26.360
And once you have shares in a
pool, you can resell the shares.

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:29.932
So a bank who has to study the
homeowner and you know have

00:13:29.932 --> 00:13:31.250
meetings with them.
 

00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:32.985
And you know,
Jimmy Stewart had to look into

00:13:32.985 --> 00:13:33.428
his eyes.
 

00:13:33.428 --> 00:13:35.958
So Jimmy Stewart may have
convinced himself the guy is a

00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:38.672
good risk, but how could Jimmy
Stewart ever sell the loan to

00:13:38.672 --> 00:13:39.500
somebody else.
 

00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:41.174
The other buyer,
who hasn't looked into

00:13:41.174 --> 00:13:43.027
Martini's eyes,
he's never going to believe

00:13:43.027 --> 00:13:44.879
Jimmy Stewart that that's a good
loan.

00:13:44.879 --> 00:13:47.559
So Jimmy Stewart is going to be
stuck with that loan for 30

00:13:47.559 --> 00:13:47.928
years.
 

00:13:47.928 --> 00:13:50.947
In the Fannie and Freddie
pools, the shareholder who buys

00:13:50.947 --> 00:13:54.018
the loans and knows they're
standardized knows exactly the

00:13:54.018 --> 00:13:57.519
same thing as the next guy who
might buy his shares from him.

00:13:57.519 --> 00:14:00.363
So if the shareholder will be
willing to pay more for the

00:14:00.363 --> 00:14:02.274
loan,
because he knows that if he

00:14:02.274 --> 00:14:04.256
needs cash,
he doesn't have to wait 30

00:14:04.256 --> 00:14:06.820
years, he can just sell his
shares to somebody else.

00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:08.678
So because of the
diversification,

00:14:08.678 --> 00:14:10.970
because of the reduction in
adverse selection,

00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:13.389
and because of this ability to
resell the shares,

00:14:13.389 --> 00:14:16.816
lenders, that is shareholders,
are willing to pay more for the

00:14:16.816 --> 00:14:17.490
mortgages.
 

00:14:17.490 --> 00:14:19.408
And so the mortgage rate went
down.

00:14:19.408 --> 00:14:23.421
So, I've estimated that this
operation together with the next

00:14:23.421 --> 00:14:27.231
one I'm going to talk about,
has reduced mortgage rates by

00:14:27.231 --> 00:14:28.769
at least a percent.
 

00:14:28.769 --> 00:14:31.634
So if you think the average
loan is $200,000,

00:14:31.634 --> 00:14:35.605
you're talking about $2,000 a
year that the average homeowners

00:14:35.605 --> 00:14:38.080
save by this financial
innovation.

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:42.048
So securitization seems to have
been a great boon.

00:14:42.048 --> 00:14:43.976
Now in 2002,
when I made these slides,

00:14:43.976 --> 00:14:47.308
I'll just give you an idea of
the size of the mortgage market.

00:14:47.308 --> 00:14:49.808
And you have to double all
these numbers today,

00:14:49.808 --> 00:14:50.570
pretty much.
 

00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:54.056
So you see that you know the
stock market was around $15

00:14:54.056 --> 00:14:57.860
trillion and the mortgages
around $7 trillion at the time.

00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:02.000
And you know that compares to
$2 trillion for corporate bonds

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.210
or $3 trillion for treasuries.
 

00:15:04.210 --> 00:15:06.207
You see how big the mortgage
market was then,

00:15:06.207 --> 00:15:07.480
and now it's twice as big.
 

00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:10.943
It's the same size basically as
the stock market,

00:15:10.943 --> 00:15:13.759
which hasn't really grown since
then.

00:15:13.759 --> 00:15:18.730
So, I don't have time to talk
about this.

00:15:18.730 --> 00:15:20.952
But, of course,
of the mortgage market,

00:15:20.952 --> 00:15:24.110
some of it is commercial,
some of it is residential.

00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:25.590
The vast majority is
residential.

00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:27.700
But there's a very big
commercial mortgage market.

00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:31.794
I'm going to be talking mostly
about the residential mortgage

00:15:31.794 --> 00:15:32.408
market.
 

00:15:32.408 --> 00:15:35.970
Some of these mortgages are in
fact held by the banks without

00:15:35.970 --> 00:15:38.639
selling them to Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac.

00:15:38.639 --> 00:15:41.591
But a lot of them are
securitized just in the way we

00:15:41.591 --> 00:15:42.460
talked about.
 

00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:44.921
And they're going to be private
securitizations later that we'll

00:15:44.921 --> 00:15:45.428
talk about.
 

00:15:45.428 --> 00:15:52.029
And so now that securitized
part is $10 trillion.

00:15:52.029 --> 00:15:56.470
I'll give the numbers,
recent numbers,

00:15:56.470 --> 00:15:57.428
later.
 

00:15:57.428 --> 00:15:59.570
So actually that may be a
little bit big.

00:15:59.570 --> 00:16:02.783
The $7 trillion,
the securitized part of the

00:16:02.783 --> 00:16:04.129
mortgage market.
 

00:16:04.129 --> 00:16:11.678
So in 2002, the agencies
dominated the security market.

00:16:11.678 --> 00:16:15.124
The securitized loans were
almost all Fannie Mae and

00:16:15.124 --> 00:16:16.070
Freddie Mac.
 

00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:19.046
There's also another agency
called Ginnie Mae,

00:16:19.046 --> 00:16:22.950
but there was another part of
it, which were jumbo loans.

00:16:22.950 --> 00:16:24.149
So there was a size limit.
 

00:16:24.149 --> 00:16:26.519
The loans couldn't be too small
and couldn't be too big for

00:16:26.519 --> 00:16:27.870
these Fannie and Freddie pools.
 

00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:32.090
The government was trying to
appeal to the middle class.

00:16:32.090 --> 00:16:35.570
Establish homeownership in the
reliable middle class.

00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:39.148
And so the wealthy who were
buying million dollar homes

00:16:39.148 --> 00:16:43.123
weren't able to get their loans
sold into a Fannie or Freddie

00:16:43.123 --> 00:16:43.720
pool.
 

00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:47.289
And so those loans were
securitized the same way,

00:16:47.289 --> 00:16:51.827
but by private agencies and not
by banks, by investment banks,

00:16:51.827 --> 00:16:54.058
and not by the government.
 

00:16:54.058 --> 00:16:56.259
And that at the time,
in 2002, was half a trillion.

00:16:56.259 --> 00:16:59.669
We'll come to all these numbers
later.

00:16:59.669 --> 00:17:01.288
When we say today's numbers.
 

00:17:01.288 --> 00:17:04.712
So the next innovation after
the 1970s, came in the 80s and

00:17:04.712 --> 00:17:07.960
that's the collateralized
mortgage obligation market.

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:09.660
CMOs, they are called.
 

00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:13.444
So the investment banks like
Kidder Peabody and Lehman

00:17:13.444 --> 00:17:16.944
Brothers, for example,
would buy some of these big

00:17:16.944 --> 00:17:17.660
pools.
 

00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:20.598
And then they would cut the
pools, which were just

00:17:20.598 --> 00:17:21.558
pass-throughs.
 

00:17:21.558 --> 00:17:24.308
So the pools just passed
through the money that the

00:17:24.308 --> 00:17:25.960
homeowners were giving them.
 

00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:29.106
So maybe they were passing
through $1,000 a month as the

00:17:29.106 --> 00:17:29.680
promise.
 

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:34.292
Well, say Kidder Peabody,
might buy a pool promising

00:17:34.292 --> 00:17:37.640
$1,000 a month to the
shareholders.

00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:40.058
And then cut the promise into
two pieces.

00:17:40.058 --> 00:17:42.877
Maybe a floater,
which would pay $500 plus the

00:17:42.877 --> 00:17:43.880
interest rate.
 

00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:47.076
And so when the interest rate
went up, the payments would go

00:17:47.076 --> 00:17:49.190
up, that's why it's called a
floater.

00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:51.705
And maybe a second piece called
an inverse floater,

00:17:51.705 --> 00:17:53.720
which is $500 minus the
interest rate.

00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:56.089
So as the interest rate went
up, the payments would get

00:17:56.089 --> 00:17:56.529
smaller.
 

00:17:56.529 --> 00:17:58.618
But as the interest rate went
down, the payments would get

00:17:58.618 --> 00:17:58.950
bigger.
 

00:17:58.950 --> 00:18:00.278
That's called an inverse
floater.

00:18:00.278 --> 00:18:02.519
So that way the two add up to
$1,000.

00:18:02.519 --> 00:18:05.990
But now, you can appeal to two
different buyers.

00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:09.041
A buyer who needs the money
when interest rates go up would

00:18:09.041 --> 00:18:09.990
buy the floater.
 

00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:12.411
A buyer who needs the money
when interest rates go down,

00:18:12.411 --> 00:18:13.818
would buy the inverse floater.
 

00:18:13.818 --> 00:18:17.210
So by creating out of plain
vanilla promise,

00:18:17.210 --> 00:18:21.625
two more tailored promises,
you can target more sharply a

00:18:21.625 --> 00:18:22.730
clientele.
 

00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:26.009
And therefore get probably more
than half the money for each of

00:18:26.009 --> 00:18:26.910
the two pieces.
 

00:18:26.910 --> 00:18:29.615
And that way,
of course competition in the

00:18:29.615 --> 00:18:33.376
CMO market raises the amount
people are willing to pay for

00:18:33.376 --> 00:18:34.828
the pass-throughs.
 

00:18:34.828 --> 00:18:37.559
Because they can then buy them
and split them up.

00:18:37.559 --> 00:18:40.190
And sell them for more.
 

00:18:40.190 --> 00:18:42.098
So that raises the price of the
pass-throughs,

00:18:42.098 --> 00:18:44.923
which in turn raises the price
that the homeowners can sell

00:18:44.923 --> 00:18:46.867
their mortgage,
which in turn lowers the

00:18:46.867 --> 00:18:48.960
interest rate that the
homeowners have to pay.

00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:53.931
So again, it's another reason
why this whole operation of

00:18:53.931 --> 00:18:59.078
securitization improved the
welfare of almost everybody.

00:18:59.078 --> 00:19:04.057
So, the pieces gradually got
more complicated So if there was

00:19:04.057 --> 00:19:07.557
default or somebody prepaid,
as we talked about,

00:19:07.557 --> 00:19:10.464
used their option to pay early,
instead of getting the money

00:19:10.464 --> 00:19:13.431
you expected,
you get extra or less money

00:19:13.431 --> 00:19:15.029
than you expected.
 

00:19:15.029 --> 00:19:16.009
That created risk.
 

00:19:16.009 --> 00:19:18.509
And some of these buyers didn't
want to bear the risk.

00:19:18.509 --> 00:19:21.837
So maybe you'd make the pieces
$400 plus the interest rate and

00:19:21.837 --> 00:19:23.528
$400 minus the interest rate.
 

00:19:23.528 --> 00:19:27.242
And leave $200 to what might be
called a residual piece or a

00:19:27.242 --> 00:19:28.880
derivative or something.
 

00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:31.440
And that $200 would bear the
risk.

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:34.191
So if someone defaulted,
you take it out of the $200

00:19:34.191 --> 00:19:36.348
piece and not of the first two
pieces.

00:19:36.348 --> 00:19:39.663
So that split up,
again, made the floater and

00:19:39.663 --> 00:19:43.880
inverse floater safer and
encouraged people to buy it.

00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:45.945
But of course,
somebody had to buy the

00:19:45.945 --> 00:19:48.460
residual piece,
which was more complicated.

00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:52.420
So, as I said,
this whole operation was a way

00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:55.118
of accomplishing two things.
 

00:19:55.118 --> 00:19:58.250
It made homeowners able to sell
their promises for more.

00:19:58.250 --> 00:20:00.420
So they effectively were paying
a lower interest rate.

00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:03.130
So it made it easier to move
into houses.

00:20:03.130 --> 00:20:05.787
And that's precisely what the
government intended by creating

00:20:05.787 --> 00:20:06.538
these agencies.
 

00:20:06.538 --> 00:20:10.074
It also allowed buyers and
investors to get money in the

00:20:10.074 --> 00:20:13.480
cases they needed it,
in the states they needed it.

00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:15.900
Because the pieces were tailor
made for them.

00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:19.361
So I realized,
while I was there at Kidder

00:20:19.361 --> 00:20:21.452
Peabody,
that this whole multi

00:20:21.452 --> 00:20:24.220
trillion-dollar operation behind
the scenes was,

00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:27.241
as I said, invisible to
everybody and was worth writing

00:20:27.241 --> 00:20:27.690
about.
 

00:20:27.690 --> 00:20:33.152
It was bringing great welfare
gain to the country and nobody

00:20:33.152 --> 00:20:35.190
quite knew about it.
 

00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:38.910
So for me, it crystalized what
the essence of finance is.

00:20:38.910 --> 00:20:41.654
The essence of finance is
you're trying to create

00:20:41.654 --> 00:20:43.761
promises,
the financial system is

00:20:43.761 --> 00:20:47.046
creating promises,
that deliver money to people in

00:20:47.046 --> 00:20:49.619
circumstances or states as I
call it,

00:20:49.619 --> 00:20:51.680
that they really need the money.
 

00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:53.698
But of course,
you have to guarantee that the

00:20:53.698 --> 00:20:55.348
money is going to be paid to
them.

00:20:55.348 --> 00:20:57.838
So in order to do that,
you have to have collateral.

00:20:57.838 --> 00:21:02.209
So this entire system is a way
of creating promises and backing

00:21:02.209 --> 00:21:03.828
them with collateral.
 

00:21:03.828 --> 00:21:05.943
So if you remember,
here are the potential

00:21:05.943 --> 00:21:08.778
promises, and maybe some people
want money down here.

00:21:08.778 --> 00:21:10.695
That's when the interest rates
go up, they're buying the

00:21:10.695 --> 00:21:11.078
floaters.
 

00:21:11.078 --> 00:21:12.888
Way over there,
the money's going down,

00:21:12.888 --> 00:21:15.699
the interest rates are going
down, that's the people who buy

00:21:15.699 --> 00:21:16.890
the inverse floaters.
 

00:21:16.890 --> 00:21:20.190
That's when they're getting
most of their money.

00:21:20.190 --> 00:21:23.115
But these promises,
you have a reason to expect to

00:21:23.115 --> 00:21:26.278
get paid, because they're backed
by the collateral.

00:21:26.278 --> 00:21:28.690
OK, so this is not a very good
picture.

00:21:28.690 --> 00:21:31.863
The houses backed the promises
of the homeowner like in

00:21:31.863 --> 00:21:32.980
Babylonian times.
 

00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:35.588
If the homeowner doesn't pay,
he loses his house.

00:21:35.588 --> 00:21:39.226
Then those mortgages
themselves, those mortgage

00:21:39.226 --> 00:21:44.205
promises, are backing the pools,
which are selling shares to the

00:21:44.205 --> 00:21:45.548
shareholders.
 

00:21:45.548 --> 00:21:49.434
But those shares are backing
the CMOs, which are making more

00:21:49.434 --> 00:21:50.950
complicated promises.
 

00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:53.930
So the collateral you see is
used once by the homes,

00:21:53.930 --> 00:21:56.210
once by the pools,
once for the CMOs.

00:21:56.210 --> 00:21:59.118
And then it will turn out,
as we'll see in a few minutes,

00:21:59.118 --> 00:22:02.440
that the investors who buy are
borrowing money,

00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:05.368
buying on margin,
using the CMO pieces they buy,

00:22:05.368 --> 00:22:07.000
as collateral for their
purchases.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.328
So the collateral is being used
and reused.

00:22:09.328 --> 00:22:12.035
And so in fact,
the entire system is stretching

00:22:12.035 --> 00:22:14.798
the available collateral as much
as possible.

00:22:14.798 --> 00:22:17.098
So collateral is a very scarce
resource.

00:22:17.098 --> 00:22:19.519
It's very important to running
a financial system.

00:22:19.519 --> 00:22:22.450
Many developing countries don't
have any collateral.

00:22:22.450 --> 00:22:25.460
And therefore they have a
primitive financial system.

00:22:25.460 --> 00:22:27.561
Here, there's a tremendous
incentive to stretch the

00:22:27.561 --> 00:22:28.950
collateral as much as possible.
 

00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:31.900
You can stretch it by using it
over and over again or by

00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:34.529
letting the same collateral back
many promises.

00:22:34.529 --> 00:22:36.390
We saw both of those,
the tranching,

00:22:36.390 --> 00:22:38.729
the different CMO pieces,
and the pyramiding,

00:22:38.729 --> 00:22:41.598
the using the same collateral
over and over again.

00:22:41.598 --> 00:22:46.518
So I wrote my first paper,
published it,

00:22:46.518 --> 00:22:47.779
in 1997.
 

00:22:47.779 --> 00:22:51.368
I had written it while I was at
Kidder Peabody.

00:22:51.368 --> 00:22:53.730
And one of the questions I
asked was,

00:22:53.730 --> 00:22:56.286
when you take out a loan,
not only what interest rate do

00:22:56.286 --> 00:22:58.767
you have to pay,
but how much collateral do you

00:22:58.767 --> 00:22:59.618
have to put up?
 

00:22:59.618 --> 00:23:02.598
And that was a question that
nobody seemed to have asked

00:23:02.598 --> 00:23:05.200
really before,
in a general equilibrium model.

00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:07.848
So that was my first paper on
the subject.

00:23:07.848 --> 00:23:10.058
I want to get back to Kidder
Peabody.

00:23:10.058 --> 00:23:13.035
Kidder Peabody,
as I said when I started,

00:23:13.035 --> 00:23:16.829
was a sleepy number seven
ranked investment bank.

00:23:16.829 --> 00:23:18.940
Didn't dominate any market.
 

00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:23.368
But it came to completely
dominate the CMO market.

00:23:23.368 --> 00:23:26.439
So this, as I said,
was a multi trillion-dollar

00:23:26.439 --> 00:23:27.038
market.
 

00:23:27.038 --> 00:23:30.452
And if you look at all the
pieces that are being promised

00:23:30.452 --> 00:23:32.987
here,
what Kidder decided to do was,

00:23:32.987 --> 00:23:35.650
things got more and more
complicated,

00:23:35.650 --> 00:23:37.641
there weren't just two pieces,
there weren't just three

00:23:37.641 --> 00:23:39.693
pieces,
there were 90 pieces typically

00:23:39.693 --> 00:23:40.480
at that time.
 

00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:46.299
And so a typical investment
bank that wanted to buy a pool

00:23:46.299 --> 00:23:49.160
and sell these CMO pieces.
 

00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:51.577
Like let's say,
Salomon or First Boston,

00:23:51.577 --> 00:23:54.430
they were the ones who first
did these CMOs.

00:23:54.430 --> 00:23:57.477
They would try to line up 90
buyers and figure out what each

00:23:57.477 --> 00:23:59.130
of the 90 were willing to pay.
 

00:23:59.130 --> 00:24:02.082
And then when they added up the
prices each of the 90 willing to

00:24:02.082 --> 00:24:03.846
pay,
they'd go and if they thought

00:24:03.846 --> 00:24:06.670
the sum of those was bigger than
the price in the pool,

00:24:06.670 --> 00:24:08.828
they'd go to the pool and buy
the pool.

00:24:08.828 --> 00:24:11.510
And then immediately make a
profit by selling off the 90

00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:11.950
pieces.
 

00:24:11.950 --> 00:24:16.618
Well, at Kidder,
the head of mortgages,

00:24:16.618 --> 00:24:20.710
who by this time by the way,
was my young little cousin,

00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:27.743
who through hard work had
worked his way up to running the

00:24:27.743 --> 00:24:30.460
small CMO operation.
 

00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:33.023
He got the idea that what
Kidder could do,

00:24:33.023 --> 00:24:35.838
was to find a buyer for the
riskiest piece.

00:24:35.838 --> 00:24:37.516
The one that I've put in
yellow, remember,

00:24:37.516 --> 00:24:38.130
the residual.
 

00:24:38.130 --> 00:24:41.136
Which was maybe called an
inverse IO, it had different

00:24:41.136 --> 00:24:43.009
names, but the riskiest pieces.
 

00:24:43.009 --> 00:24:46.240
Once he found the buyer,
a place to put the riskiest

00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:49.006
piece,
he would borrow the money to

00:24:49.006 --> 00:24:52.544
buy the pass through,
and hold an inventory of all

00:24:52.544 --> 00:24:53.660
the other pieces.
 

00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:56.566
So he knew, that eventually,
we would be able to sell off

00:24:56.566 --> 00:24:57.759
all the other pieces.
 

00:24:57.759 --> 00:25:00.680
And so we had a tremendous
advantage.

00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:03.453
While everyone else was looking
for buyers for 90 pieces,

00:25:03.453 --> 00:25:06.078
we had to find a buyer for one
piece or two pieces.

00:25:06.078 --> 00:25:10.833
So we then had an inventory of
88 pieces, say,

00:25:10.833 --> 00:25:11.890
to sell.
 

00:25:11.890 --> 00:25:14.147
And as we did deal after deal,
that inventory would get bigger

00:25:14.147 --> 00:25:14.630
and bigger.
 

00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:18.127
So our sales force would have a
much easier time selling a

00:25:18.127 --> 00:25:18.618
piece.
 

00:25:18.618 --> 00:25:20.611
We wouldn't have to call
someone up and say,

00:25:20.611 --> 00:25:23.390
do you want piece number four,
that's the one we're trying to

00:25:23.390 --> 00:25:24.269
get you to buy.
 

00:25:24.269 --> 00:25:27.858
We'd call up and say we've got
a huge stock of different kinds

00:25:27.858 --> 00:25:30.858
of pieces, of all kinds,
from all kinds of deals.

00:25:30.858 --> 00:25:32.680
Maybe you're interested in one
of them.

00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:35.172
So it's much easier for a sales
force to sell with that

00:25:35.172 --> 00:25:38.078
situation than it was for the
other investment banks to sell.

00:25:38.078 --> 00:25:40.882
So of course,
we lured away some of the best

00:25:40.882 --> 00:25:41.858
sales people.
 

00:25:41.858 --> 00:25:45.324
So of course,
the down side to all of that is

00:25:45.324 --> 00:25:49.181
we had to be very careful that
the pieces we held,

00:25:49.181 --> 00:25:51.150
we knew how to hedge.
 

00:25:51.150 --> 00:25:53.635
We had to be very careful that
when we held all these pieces,

00:25:53.635 --> 00:25:55.750
between the time we held them
and finally sold them,

00:25:55.750 --> 00:25:57.160
we didn't lose a lot of money.
 

00:25:57.160 --> 00:26:00.464
And sometimes we were the ones
who held the most dangerous

00:26:00.464 --> 00:26:01.220
piece, too.
 

00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:04.563
So we had to figure out what
were going to be the cash flows

00:26:04.563 --> 00:26:06.828
of these pieces and how to model
them.

00:26:06.828 --> 00:26:08.858
And that's what we're going to
mathematically talk about the

00:26:08.858 --> 00:26:09.410
next few days.
 

00:26:09.410 --> 00:26:12.588
But I'm going to give you a
hint of this now.

00:26:12.588 --> 00:26:14.958
So we had to predict,
among other things,

00:26:14.958 --> 00:26:17.088
what the prepayments would be,
OK.

00:26:17.088 --> 00:26:19.722
And so, if you talked to a
macro economist,

00:26:19.722 --> 00:26:22.042
especially in those days,
and you say,

00:26:22.042 --> 00:26:25.430
what do you think is going to
happen in the world?

00:26:25.430 --> 00:26:28.710
They'll usually say,
well I think in the next two

00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:31.534
quarters,
unemployment is going to go up

00:26:31.534 --> 00:26:34.029
half a percent,
and then maybe things are going

00:26:34.029 --> 00:26:38.084
to get better for the next year,
and beyond that it's too hard

00:26:38.084 --> 00:26:38.880
to tell.
 

00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:41.338
So these mortgages are 30-year
mortgages.

00:26:41.338 --> 00:26:43.865
You can't have a prediction
that lasts a year and a half,

00:26:43.865 --> 00:26:45.670
you have to have a 30-year
prediction.

00:26:45.670 --> 00:26:47.789
And the macro economists,
by the way, are typically

00:26:47.789 --> 00:26:48.130
wrong.
 

00:26:48.130 --> 00:26:50.068
Even in their two-month
prediction or six month

00:26:50.068 --> 00:26:50.660
predictions.
 

00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:54.646
So how can we risk billions of
dollars holding an instrument

00:26:54.646 --> 00:26:57.517
that's 30 years long,
which depends on what people

00:26:57.517 --> 00:26:59.298
are going to do over the next 30
years?

00:26:59.298 --> 00:27:02.250
Well the answer is you can't
make a prediction and expect it

00:27:02.250 --> 00:27:02.950
to be right.
 

00:27:02.950 --> 00:27:05.140
But you can make a conditional
prediction.

00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:07.218
You can say,
if interest rates do such and

00:27:07.218 --> 00:27:10.989
such for the next four years,
and housing prices do such and

00:27:10.989 --> 00:27:14.727
such for the next four years,
then in that fifth year,

00:27:14.727 --> 00:27:16.750
pre payments will be so and so.
 

00:27:16.750 --> 00:27:18.848
That's a conditional prediction.
 

00:27:18.848 --> 00:27:21.898
It's much easier to make a
conditional prediction than an

00:27:21.898 --> 00:27:23.368
unconditional prediction.
 

00:27:23.368 --> 00:27:27.685
It's shocking that so many
economists are lured into making

00:27:27.685 --> 00:27:29.769
unconditional predictions.
 

00:27:29.769 --> 00:27:31.528
It's not a business we should
be in.

00:27:31.528 --> 00:27:33.529
We should always be making
conditional predictions.

00:27:33.529 --> 00:27:36.980
Well, I learned that lesson at
Kidder.

00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:38.907
So, you know,
the idea of possible worlds is

00:27:38.907 --> 00:27:41.690
going to play a central role in
our course from here on out.

00:27:41.690 --> 00:27:45.915
And the possible worlds are the
paths of interest rates or home

00:27:45.915 --> 00:27:46.529
prices.
 

00:27:46.529 --> 00:27:50.176
And so here's a very short,
this is maybe a one year into

00:27:50.176 --> 00:27:53.890
the future, and we'd have to go
30 years in the future.

00:27:53.890 --> 00:27:56.768
As you can imagine,
and this is just actually a

00:27:56.768 --> 00:27:59.895
much smaller group of
possibilities than we used to

00:27:59.895 --> 00:28:00.710
consider.
 

00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:03.160
But, you see all the
possibilities that could unfold

00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:04.410
over the next 12 months.
 

00:28:04.410 --> 00:28:08.358
And you see the blue line is
one of those possible paths.

00:28:08.358 --> 00:28:10.790
So we have to predict,
if we knew which path interest

00:28:10.790 --> 00:28:12.990
rates and housing prices were
going to take,

00:28:12.990 --> 00:28:16.220
like that blue line,
could we then predict,

00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:19.210
at the end of the blue line,
what pre payments would be.

00:28:19.210 --> 00:28:21.666
Of course, if you followed
another path down to here,

00:28:21.666 --> 00:28:24.220
we'd make a different
prediction about pre payments.

00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:27.990
So, the cash flows are the pre
payments and defaults.

00:28:27.990 --> 00:28:30.240
That's what we have to predict.
 

00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:34.250
And so, you might say,
what good is it to predict a

00:28:34.250 --> 00:28:37.618
different number on each of
these trees.

00:28:37.618 --> 00:28:39.982
Then basically what you're
saying is you don't know what's

00:28:39.982 --> 00:28:40.730
going to happen.
 

00:28:40.730 --> 00:28:42.390
But that's far from the truth.
 

00:28:42.390 --> 00:28:46.633
If you know what the payments
are on each of the paths and

00:28:46.633 --> 00:28:49.088
then you can hedge those paths.
 

00:28:49.088 --> 00:28:51.222
So for example,
suppose the payments are very

00:28:51.222 --> 00:28:52.970
low here and very high at the
top.

00:28:52.970 --> 00:28:55.753
Well, if you can buy another
instrument that pays you

00:28:55.753 --> 00:28:58.611
something at the bottom,
and you pay at the top,

00:28:58.611 --> 00:29:02.355
you can offset the variation in
cash flows and the mortgage by

00:29:02.355 --> 00:29:05.854
that other instrument and
guarantee yourself the same safe

00:29:05.854 --> 00:29:07.880
payment all the way through.
 

00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:10.164
That's the sort of thing that
we did it at Kidder Peabody,

00:29:10.164 --> 00:29:11.970
which we're going to study in
great detail.

00:29:11.970 --> 00:29:15.080
We held these complicated
pieces whose payments would vary

00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:15.900
tremendously.
 

00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:18.259
So we ran a huge risk of losing
all our money.

00:29:18.259 --> 00:29:20.440
But then we would hedge them
with some other instruments.

00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:23.150
So in the end,
we've got a pretty safe return.

00:29:23.150 --> 00:29:26.003
And because we knew the return
was safe, we felt we could pay

00:29:26.003 --> 00:29:27.670
up a good amount of money for
it.

00:29:27.670 --> 00:29:29.719
Whereas other buyers who
couldn't hedge it,

00:29:29.719 --> 00:29:31.328
wouldn't want to buy it at all.
 

00:29:31.328 --> 00:29:35.759
So, now let's just see how good
the predictions were.

00:29:35.759 --> 00:29:39.009
Here's a typical history of pre
payments.

00:29:39.009 --> 00:29:47.759
So you can see it ranges to 99
from 88, something like that.

00:29:47.759 --> 00:29:50.529
So it's 10 years,
11 years, of pre payments.

00:29:50.529 --> 00:29:54.078
So that's the percentage of
people who prepay every year.

00:29:54.078 --> 00:29:56.078
So it's the annualized
percentage.

00:29:56.078 --> 00:29:58.249
So every month,
you check how many people paid

00:29:58.249 --> 00:30:01.276
off their mortgage early,
and you assume that rate stayed

00:30:01.276 --> 00:30:03.170
the same for the whole 12
months,

00:30:03.170 --> 00:30:05.210
what would the pre payment
percentage be?

00:30:05.210 --> 00:30:07.068
That's what the number measures
all the time.

00:30:07.068 --> 00:30:09.338
You see in some months it's
practically zero.

00:30:09.338 --> 00:30:13.028
These are pre payments for a
mortgage issued in 1986 that had

00:30:13.028 --> 00:30:13.950
an 8% coupon.
 

00:30:13.950 --> 00:30:17.733
So all basically,
1986 mortgages with an 8%

00:30:17.733 --> 00:30:23.318
coupon issued by Fannie Mae or
some big pool of them anyway.

00:30:23.318 --> 00:30:25.667
So you see sometimes the pre
payments are very low,

00:30:25.667 --> 00:30:27.358
sometimes they're incredibly
high.

00:30:27.358 --> 00:30:29.871
How standing at the bottom at
the back there,

00:30:29.871 --> 00:30:33.352
in '88 say, could you possibly
have predicted that pre payment

00:30:33.352 --> 00:30:34.380
going forward?
 

00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:36.480
You know with the ups and downs
and stuff like that.

00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:38.500
Well you couldn't,
if you made it unconditional.

00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:40.858
But if you made it conditional,
it's not so hard.

00:30:40.858 --> 00:30:43.546
Because what do you think
happened in '93 that made pre

00:30:43.546 --> 00:30:44.789
payments go up so high?
 

00:30:44.789 --> 00:30:47.348
It was interest rates went down.
 

00:30:47.348 --> 00:30:49.893
Homeowners had an opportunity
to refinance at a lower interest

00:30:49.893 --> 00:30:51.269
rate with a different mortgage.
 

00:30:51.269 --> 00:30:52.380
So of course they did that.
 

00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:55.103
And in those other months,
when pre payments are very low,

00:30:55.103 --> 00:30:56.680
the interest rates were higher.
 

00:30:56.680 --> 00:31:00.817
So clearly, there's a
connection between the mortgage

00:31:00.817 --> 00:31:05.590
rate you got and your original
mortgage and the new rate that

00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:07.740
you can refinance into.
 

00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:10.098
And that is part of your
conditional prediction.

00:31:10.098 --> 00:31:13.440
But another thing that's
interesting is burn out.

00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:18.799
So if you look at two pools,
one issued in '95 and one

00:31:18.799 --> 00:31:22.739
issued in '92,
and with exactly the same

00:31:22.739 --> 00:31:27.890
coupons, you'll see that the
older one is always pre paying

00:31:27.890 --> 00:31:30.108
less than the new one.
 

00:31:30.108 --> 00:31:33.140
At least starting from '95
onward.

00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:37.410
So it's as if the old one burns
out.

00:31:37.410 --> 00:31:40.664
Once it has an opportunity to
pre pay, you see a lot of pre

00:31:40.664 --> 00:31:42.630
payments and then they slow
down.

00:31:42.630 --> 00:31:45.140
So that's another thing people
had observed.

00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:49.117
So you might have thought the
standard way of modeling things

00:31:49.117 --> 00:31:51.970
at that time was to just do a
regression.

00:31:51.970 --> 00:31:55.890
You say, well we figured out
that pre payments depend on the

00:31:55.890 --> 00:31:59.808
new interest rate and how much
more in the money you are.

00:31:59.808 --> 00:32:02.160
And it depends on how long
you've been in the money because

00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:02.890
of the burn out.
 

00:32:02.890 --> 00:32:06.180
You try to estimate a curve,
like an S curve or something,

00:32:06.180 --> 00:32:09.354
that depends on parameters,
that's on the interest rate,

00:32:09.354 --> 00:32:10.740
and on the burn out.
 

00:32:10.740 --> 00:32:12.250
How long you've been in the
money.

00:32:12.250 --> 00:32:14.943
And according to some
parameters that described the S

00:32:14.943 --> 00:32:17.118
and you tried estimate those
parameters.

00:32:17.118 --> 00:32:19.096
So that would be an old
fashioned way of measuring

00:32:19.096 --> 00:32:19.460
things.
 

00:32:19.460 --> 00:32:22.229
But as we're going to see in
this course, we look at

00:32:22.229 --> 00:32:24.509
everything from an agent based
approach.

00:32:24.509 --> 00:32:27.318
So what are the individual
agents doing?

00:32:27.318 --> 00:32:31.990
So, I got the idea of trying to
model all you care about is

00:32:31.990 --> 00:32:36.420
aggregate pre payments,
what is the whole pool doing?

00:32:36.420 --> 00:32:38.366
But I decided,
let's try and predict every

00:32:38.366 --> 00:32:39.269
single homeowner.
 

00:32:39.269 --> 00:32:42.188
So let's try to put ourselves
in the mind of every homeowner

00:32:42.188 --> 00:32:43.029
in the country.
 

00:32:43.029 --> 00:32:45.430
Why are they pre paying or not
pre paying?

00:32:45.430 --> 00:32:48.509
Well, they're pre paying if
they get an opportunity to save

00:32:48.509 --> 00:32:49.200
some money.
 

00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:55.038
But, we know from that graph
that lots of people don't

00:32:55.038 --> 00:32:56.029
prepay.
 

00:32:56.029 --> 00:32:59.750
Even when there's a tremendous
opportunity, only 60% percent of

00:32:59.750 --> 00:33:02.390
the people are pre paying in a
whole year.

00:33:02.390 --> 00:33:05.336
So that means the whole year
goes by, and only 60% percent of

00:33:05.336 --> 00:33:06.318
them have prepaid.
 

00:33:06.318 --> 00:33:09.358
So every month,
8% or 10% are pre paying.

00:33:09.358 --> 00:33:12.200
So the other 90% haven't seen
their opportunity.

00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:14.098
They've missed it or they've
waited.

00:33:14.098 --> 00:33:17.200
So clearly, not everybody jumps
at the opportunity.

00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:19.358
So it must be that people are
different somehow.

00:33:19.358 --> 00:33:23.278
Even though they're in exactly
the same circumstance in terms

00:33:23.278 --> 00:33:24.390
of refinancing.
 

00:33:24.390 --> 00:33:27.368
So, you have to account for the
difference.

00:33:27.368 --> 00:33:30.661
So, I imagined that different
people have a different cost of

00:33:30.661 --> 00:33:31.319
prepaying.
 

00:33:31.319 --> 00:33:33.308
It's a hassle to prepay.
 

00:33:33.308 --> 00:33:36.140
Maybe you literally have to pay
some money to prepay.

00:33:36.140 --> 00:33:38.548
Maybe you have to take a day
off from your job.

00:33:38.548 --> 00:33:40.788
Some people have other things
to do.

00:33:40.788 --> 00:33:42.722
They're not that alert because
they're paying attention to

00:33:42.722 --> 00:33:44.588
their kids or they're paying
attention to their work.

00:33:44.588 --> 00:33:46.680
So not everybody has the same
alertness.

00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:49.108
And not everyone follows
financial matters as closely as

00:33:49.108 --> 00:33:49.858
everybody does.
 

00:33:49.858 --> 00:33:52.383
So, also over time,
people are getting more

00:33:52.383 --> 00:33:55.626
rational and beginning to
understand the market and pre

00:33:55.626 --> 00:33:57.130
paying more and more.
 

00:33:57.130 --> 00:33:59.519
And of course,
people hear from their friends.

00:33:59.519 --> 00:34:01.666
If their friends are all
prepaying, it's more likely that

00:34:01.666 --> 00:34:03.470
they'll think about it and
prepay themselves.

00:34:03.470 --> 00:34:07.951
So I built a model,
together with the researchers

00:34:07.951 --> 00:34:09.820
at Kidder Peabody.
 

00:34:09.820 --> 00:34:13.436
And then later we built the
model of pre payments based on

00:34:13.436 --> 00:34:16.420
every individual making a
different decision.

00:34:16.420 --> 00:34:18.677
So an individual is
characterized by his cost and

00:34:18.677 --> 00:34:19.429
his alertness.
 

00:34:19.429 --> 00:34:22.197
So different individuals have
different costs and different

00:34:22.197 --> 00:34:22.768
alertness.
 

00:34:22.768 --> 00:34:25.818
And by watching how they
behave, we can come to guess

00:34:25.818 --> 00:34:29.159
what the cost and alertness is
of each of these people.

00:34:29.159 --> 00:34:33.556
So you see this model captures
all the effects that we talked

00:34:33.556 --> 00:34:34.730
about already.
 

00:34:34.730 --> 00:34:39.215
If you have a pool of people,
you can see the vertical is how

00:34:39.215 --> 00:34:41.309
many people of each types.
 

00:34:41.309 --> 00:34:43.880
So there are different costs
and different alertnesses.

00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:46.478
And so at the beginning,
when you have a new pool,

00:34:46.478 --> 00:34:48.969
like on the right,
there are a lot of people.

00:34:48.969 --> 00:34:52.000
And as, they get opportunities
to refinance,

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:55.405
it's not random people who
prepay, it's the people with the

00:34:55.405 --> 00:34:58.400
highest alertness and the lowest
cost who prepay.

00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:00.456
So over time,
as a pool gets older,

00:35:00.456 --> 00:35:03.300
the distribution of people is
going to shift.

00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:07.007
It's going to be have less
hyper alert and low cost people

00:35:07.007 --> 00:35:09.739
and more high cost and low alert
people.

00:35:09.739 --> 00:35:11.750
That's why the pool is going to
slow down.

00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:14.586
So burn out is naturally
explained by an agent based

00:35:14.586 --> 00:35:15.199
approach.
 

00:35:15.199 --> 00:35:18.059
So anyway, as we go through the
course, we're going to emphasize

00:35:18.059 --> 00:35:19.329
this agent based approach.
 

00:35:19.329 --> 00:35:22.554
So building a model like that,
starting in the 1980s,

00:35:22.554 --> 00:35:25.840
and making a conditional
prediction, you can get a fit

00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:27.389
that looks like this.
 

00:35:27.389 --> 00:35:30.099
So notice, you make some
gruesome errors,

00:35:30.099 --> 00:35:32.608
like over here,
that was an expensive,

00:35:32.608 --> 00:35:35.590
'97, '98, that was an important
mistake.

00:35:35.590 --> 00:35:39.989
But you can fit this kind of
pre payment surprisingly well.

00:35:39.989 --> 00:35:43.869
OK, so that was my Kidder
Peabody days.

00:35:43.869 --> 00:35:46.335
And I thought,
my gosh, we're doing incredibly

00:35:46.335 --> 00:35:46.719
well.
 

00:35:46.719 --> 00:35:48.780
We're helping the country.
 

00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:52.503
We're doing things in a
colossal scale that nobody had

00:35:52.503 --> 00:35:53.840
ever done before.
 

00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:56.815
I think I may have not
emphasized enough that Kidder

00:35:56.815 --> 00:35:59.090
Peabody came to dominate this
market.

00:35:59.090 --> 00:36:02.730
We controlled over 20% of all
the issuance.

00:36:02.730 --> 00:36:05.125
Remember, there were trillions
of dollars of things being

00:36:05.125 --> 00:36:05.510
issued.
 

00:36:05.510 --> 00:36:09.407
So this little group of 20 year
old kids basically,

00:36:09.407 --> 00:36:12.059
plus me the old guy in
research.

00:36:12.059 --> 00:36:14.492
So them, the traders,
they were issuing something on

00:36:14.492 --> 00:36:17.260
the scale of half a trillion to
a trillion dollars of these

00:36:17.260 --> 00:36:17.690
CMOs.
 

00:36:17.690 --> 00:36:22.099
These kids in their mid 20s or
late twenties.

00:36:22.099 --> 00:36:24.679
And the world seemed to be a
better place for it.

00:36:24.679 --> 00:36:26.833
And I thought,
my gosh this is an untold story

00:36:26.833 --> 00:36:27.840
that needs telling.
 

00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:30.110
And it's an incredible success
story.

00:36:30.110 --> 00:36:37.289
Well, things suddenly changed
and in 1994 there was a crash.

00:36:37.289 --> 00:36:39.920
So this is the first of three
crashes I've lived through.

00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:42.300
There was a scandal at Kidder
Peabody,

00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:45.280
the Joe Jet scandal,
who was a trader,

00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:49.375
a government bond trader,
who was accused of doctoring

00:36:49.375 --> 00:36:52.389
the books and faking his big
profits.

00:36:52.389 --> 00:36:55.090
He had been Kidder Peabody man
of the year in 1993.

00:36:55.090 --> 00:36:58.126
And then in 1994,
they decided that all his

00:36:58.126 --> 00:37:02.250
profits were fictitious and that
he doctored the books.

00:37:02.250 --> 00:37:03.469
And so he was fired.
 

00:37:03.469 --> 00:37:05.889
But he sued Kidder for
discrimination.

00:37:05.889 --> 00:37:08.300
And it was a tremendous
controversy that was in the

00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:10.518
front pages of the papers for
months on end.

00:37:10.518 --> 00:37:12.657
And finally,
General Electric,

00:37:12.657 --> 00:37:15.900
who owned Kidder Peabody,
closed the firm.

00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:19.358
After hundred 135 five years,
or I guess 129 years,

00:37:19.358 --> 00:37:20.949
they closed the firm.
 

00:37:20.949 --> 00:37:24.900
So I had to go back one day,
from Yale,

00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:27.168
to Kidder Peabody,
and I invited those 75 people

00:37:27.168 --> 00:37:29.340
in the research department into
my office,

00:37:29.340 --> 00:37:31.760
and I said you're fired.
 

00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:34.907
And then I got up and I went to
the office next door and

00:37:34.907 --> 00:37:36.969
somebody said to me,
you're fired.

00:37:36.969 --> 00:37:41.090
And so we all fired each other
and the entire 130-year-old

00:37:41.090 --> 00:37:42.969
company came to a close.
 

00:37:42.969 --> 00:37:49.943
So, the head trader of
mortgages and bunch of his top

00:37:49.943 --> 00:37:55.309
lieutenants decided from a hedge
fund.

00:37:55.309 --> 00:37:58.041
So Kidder Peabody got closed,
actually sold,

00:37:58.041 --> 00:38:01.090
it wasn't closed,
it was sold to Paine Webber.

00:38:01.090 --> 00:38:04.347
And Paine Webber dropped the
name Kidder Peabody and hired

00:38:04.347 --> 00:38:06.690
many of the people from Kidder
Peabody.

00:38:06.690 --> 00:38:08.786
And in fact,
the second tier,

00:38:08.786 --> 00:38:12.755
or the more junior group of
mortgage traders at Kidder

00:38:12.755 --> 00:38:14.889
Peabody,
which was the leading mortgage

00:38:14.889 --> 00:38:17.157
company at the time,
they took over the desk at

00:38:17.157 --> 00:38:17.920
Paine Webber.
 

00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:20.190
And then Paine Webber was
bought by UBS.

00:38:20.190 --> 00:38:22.780
And those same guys took over
the desk at UBS.

00:38:22.780 --> 00:38:26.532
So the junior crew at Kidder
Peabody, some of whom were

00:38:26.532 --> 00:38:29.730
Yalies by the way,
ended up running the UBS.

00:38:29.730 --> 00:38:31.730
Or a big part of the UBS
mortgage desk.

00:38:31.730 --> 00:38:34.507
But in any case,
our mortgage traders,

00:38:34.507 --> 00:38:37.960
the head guys,
decided to from a hedge fund.

00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:42.336
Instead of selling,
the CMOs, they would buy the

00:38:42.336 --> 00:38:42.989
CMOs.
 

00:38:42.989 --> 00:38:45.260
And we called it Ellington
Capital Management.

00:38:45.260 --> 00:38:47.260
So I was one of six partners.
 

00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:48.771
I was a small partner,
because again,

00:38:48.771 --> 00:38:49.570
I stayed at Yale.
 

00:38:49.570 --> 00:38:53.909
So this introduces the last
player, the hedge funds.

00:38:53.909 --> 00:38:56.349
So what is a hedge fund?
 

00:38:56.349 --> 00:38:58.329
You heard the name,
I'm sure a thousand times.

00:38:58.329 --> 00:38:59.639
It has a bad name now.
 

00:38:59.639 --> 00:39:03.070
But a hedge fund basically
means four things.

00:39:03.070 --> 00:39:05.670
It means it's someone who
hedges.

00:39:05.670 --> 00:39:09.159
You don't just buy and hold the
thing and hope that the cash

00:39:09.159 --> 00:39:11.641
flows are good,
you try to protect yourself

00:39:11.641 --> 00:39:13.889
against as many risks as
possible.

00:39:13.889 --> 00:39:16.960
Just like I explained,
we were doing at Kidder when we

00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:20.030
tried to get the same cash flows
in every scenario.

00:39:20.030 --> 00:39:21.800
And we're going to
mathematically study that in

00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:22.610
remaining lectures.
 

00:39:22.610 --> 00:39:24.755
But you try to hedge,
that's where the name comes

00:39:24.755 --> 00:39:25.070
from.
 

00:39:25.070 --> 00:39:27.750
So you try to offset as many
risks as you can.

00:39:27.750 --> 00:39:29.179
Of course, you still run some
risks.

00:39:29.179 --> 00:39:31.730
But you're offsetting setting
as many as you can.

00:39:31.730 --> 00:39:34.206
The second most important
thing, is most of it's done,

00:39:34.206 --> 00:39:36.777
or a lot of a buying is done,
not most, but a lot of the

00:39:36.777 --> 00:39:38.599
buying is done with borrowed
money.

00:39:38.599 --> 00:39:39.889
That's called leverage.
 

00:39:39.889 --> 00:39:42.418
You don't just take your
investor capital and buy

00:39:42.418 --> 00:39:44.577
something, you take your
investor capital,

00:39:44.577 --> 00:39:47.789
you borrow some extra money,
and then you buy some stuff.

00:39:47.789 --> 00:39:50.827
And the stuff you buy you use
as collateral to guarantee that

00:39:50.827 --> 00:39:53.510
the lenders are going to get
their money paid back.

00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:54.949
So a hedge fund is generally
leveraged.

00:39:54.949 --> 00:39:58.956
The third definition of a hedge
fund, third characteristic,

00:39:58.956 --> 00:40:01.789
is that they're very lightly
regulated.

00:40:01.789 --> 00:40:02.730
So what does that mean?
 

00:40:02.730 --> 00:40:08.867
That means that a broker who
sells something has to make sure

00:40:08.867 --> 00:40:13.880
that the client on behalf of
whom he's buying,

00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:17.313
the broker, the stockbroker,
has to make sure that the

00:40:17.313 --> 00:40:20.360
purchased item is appropriate
for his client.

00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:22.170
We have no such obligations.
 

00:40:22.170 --> 00:40:27.673
We can buy and sell with anyone
we choose on behalf of our

00:40:27.673 --> 00:40:28.639
clients.
 

00:40:28.639 --> 00:40:31.389
But our clients have to be
sophisticated investors.

00:40:31.389 --> 00:40:33.190
We have to vouch that they're
sophisticated.

00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:35.851
If they have enough money,
like say $5 million to invest

00:40:35.851 --> 00:40:37.788
in the hedge fund,
they are by definition

00:40:37.788 --> 00:40:38.659
sophisticated.
 

00:40:38.659 --> 00:40:43.532
And then they don't need to be
protected by having a broker

00:40:43.532 --> 00:40:48.574
who's necessarily watching out
to see whether investments are

00:40:48.574 --> 00:40:49.920
appropriate.
 

00:40:49.920 --> 00:40:52.166
We tell them what we're
investing in and,

00:40:52.166 --> 00:40:55.030
of course, we're obliged to
explain our strategy.

00:40:55.030 --> 00:40:57.420
But once they understand our
strategy,

00:40:57.420 --> 00:41:03.813
we don't have to meet the same
test that a simple broker meets

00:41:03.813 --> 00:41:08.643
on behalf of,
let's say a poor retired

00:41:08.643 --> 00:41:10.219
individual.
 

00:41:10.219 --> 00:41:14.043
So there's less regulation and
the fourth characteristic is

00:41:14.043 --> 00:41:16.880
hedge funds typically charge
higher fees.

00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:18.360
So that's what a hedge fund is.
 

00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:21.039
Now, the first hedge fund was
started in the 1940s,

00:41:21.039 --> 00:41:22.969
I believe, by someone named
Jones.

00:41:22.969 --> 00:41:24.949
And he was a stock picker.
 

00:41:24.949 --> 00:41:27.088
And what he did,
is instead of picking let's say

00:41:27.088 --> 00:41:29.552
the best car company,
which he might have thought was

00:41:29.552 --> 00:41:32.840
Ford and leaving it at that,
he would try to hedge his risk.

00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:35.849
So he'd buy Ford,
and he'd short all the other

00:41:35.849 --> 00:41:36.920
car companies.
 

00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:40.309
So effectively,
he wasn't just betting on Ford

00:41:40.309 --> 00:41:41.289
doing well.
 

00:41:41.289 --> 00:41:44.155
Because he could lose if the
whole economy went badly,

00:41:44.155 --> 00:41:46.860
Ford and every other car
company could go badly.

00:41:46.860 --> 00:41:49.659
Instead he was betting that
Ford would do better than the

00:41:49.659 --> 00:41:50.760
other car companies.
 

00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:54.210
So he was concentrating his bet
on something he understood more.

00:41:54.210 --> 00:41:55.780
You can't be an expert about
everything.

00:41:55.780 --> 00:41:57.929
Presumably he was an expert
about cars.

00:41:57.929 --> 00:42:00.018
And he knew Ford was better
than General Motors.

00:42:00.018 --> 00:42:01.909
So that was a bet he wanted to
take.

00:42:01.909 --> 00:42:04.652
But he didn't want to take a
bet on the whole economy doing

00:42:04.652 --> 00:42:05.409
well or badly.
 

00:42:05.409 --> 00:42:11.920
So that was the beginning of
the idea of the hedged fund.

00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:16.335
Now there's so many risks that
a car company or any company

00:42:16.335 --> 00:42:16.869
runs.
 

00:42:16.869 --> 00:42:19.289
Does their president know what
he's doing?

00:42:19.289 --> 00:42:21.039
Is Detroit going to be a good
city?

00:42:21.039 --> 00:42:22.768
Is there going to change in
government regulation?

00:42:22.768 --> 00:42:25.119
Is some foreign competitor
going to appear on the scene?

00:42:25.119 --> 00:42:27.360
Is the price of oil suddenly
going to change?

00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:30.704
There's so many things they can
go wrong in a company,

00:42:30.704 --> 00:42:32.849
it really is very hard to
hedge.

00:42:32.849 --> 00:42:37.027
So hedging really makes much
more sense when you can make the

00:42:37.027 --> 00:42:38.630
problem mathematical.
 

00:42:38.630 --> 00:42:42.108
Well see, with mortgages it
really is a mathematical problem

00:42:42.108 --> 00:42:43.699
to a much greater extent.
 

00:42:43.699 --> 00:42:45.670
So it makes much more sense to
hedge.

00:42:45.670 --> 00:42:47.972
And I think it makes much more
sense to be a hedge fund if

00:42:47.972 --> 00:42:49.590
you're trading in the mortgage
market.

00:42:49.590 --> 00:42:53.255
Anyway, that's what I found out
when I visited Wall Street in

00:42:53.255 --> 00:42:54.050
those days.
 

00:42:54.050 --> 00:42:55.579
So what did the hedge fund do?
 

00:42:55.579 --> 00:42:59.570
Instead of creating these CMOs,
the hedge fund would buy them.

00:42:59.570 --> 00:43:01.630
And of course,
buy the most complicated one.

00:43:01.630 --> 00:43:04.423
So in effect,
the hedge funds would buy the

00:43:04.423 --> 00:43:07.152
most complicated,
the residual piece we're

00:43:07.152 --> 00:43:09.880
talking about,
and try to hedge that.

00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:11.244
So effectively,
the hedge fund,

00:43:11.244 --> 00:43:13.768
by hedging it,
was really carving out the cash

00:43:13.768 --> 00:43:16.983
flows of that last piece into
complicated ways and selling

00:43:16.983 --> 00:43:19.070
them off to stabilize its
profits.

00:43:19.070 --> 00:43:22.690
So really, the hedge fund
actually was continuing the work

00:43:22.690 --> 00:43:26.121
of the investment bank of
creating more and more pieces

00:43:26.121 --> 00:43:28.409
and trying to allocate the risk.
 

00:43:28.409 --> 00:43:31.539
And so the hedge fund is part
of the entire operation,

00:43:31.539 --> 00:43:36.356
which was making this mortgage
market behind the scenes make

00:43:36.356 --> 00:43:41.010
home ownership so much easier
and reduce people's risk.

00:43:41.010 --> 00:43:51.539
Or so it seemed.
 

00:43:51.539 --> 00:43:53.869
We had a hard time raising
money to begin with.

00:43:53.869 --> 00:43:56.967
Because after all,
Kidder Peabody had just gone

00:43:56.967 --> 00:43:58.179
out of business.
 

00:43:58.179 --> 00:44:02.204
And not only had we gone out of
business, but there was a

00:44:02.204 --> 00:44:04.289
general crisis at the time.
 

00:44:04.289 --> 00:44:06.748
It was not only the trading
scandal of Joe Jett,

00:44:06.748 --> 00:44:09.155
but at the same time,
there was a crisis in the

00:44:09.155 --> 00:44:10.360
derivatives market.
 

00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:13.802
Because all these complicated
pieces that were being created

00:44:13.802 --> 00:44:16.429
where pieces went up and pieces
went down,

00:44:16.429 --> 00:44:18.650
of course if you didn't know
how to hedge your risk,

00:44:18.650 --> 00:44:20.699
you could end up losing a lot
of money.

00:44:20.699 --> 00:44:25.489
So Orange County went bankrupt
in 1994.

00:44:25.489 --> 00:44:27.050
And what did Orange County do?
 

00:44:27.050 --> 00:44:29.268
They bought a bunch of inverse
floaters.

00:44:29.268 --> 00:44:32.275
So when the interest rates were
going down in the early '90s,

00:44:32.275 --> 00:44:34.380
they were making a huge amount
of money.

00:44:34.380 --> 00:44:40.170
And the fellow who ran Orange
County's municipal investments,

00:44:40.170 --> 00:44:44.320
was twice municipal investor of
the year.

00:44:44.320 --> 00:44:46.061
But in 1994,
when everything turned around

00:44:46.061 --> 00:44:48.059
and interest rates skyrocketed
for the year,

00:44:48.059 --> 00:44:50.349
his inverse floaters became
almost worthless,

00:44:50.349 --> 00:44:52.650
and he bankrupted Orange County.
 

00:44:52.650 --> 00:44:56.568
So, it was some of our inverse
floaters that were being bought,

00:44:56.568 --> 00:44:58.969
which helped bankrupt Orange
County.

00:44:58.969 --> 00:45:02.483
Plus Kidder Peabody had just
gone out of business because of

00:45:02.483 --> 00:45:03.139
Joe Jett.
 

00:45:03.139 --> 00:45:08.050
So it was very difficult for
our hedge fund to raise money.

00:45:08.050 --> 00:45:14.510
Our motto was we created the
mess, let us clean it up.

00:45:14.510 --> 00:45:16.530
Nonetheless,
we did raise some money.

00:45:16.530 --> 00:45:19.480
We had an important starting
investment from the Ziff

00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:22.090
Brothers and we had an
incredible boom time.

00:45:22.090 --> 00:45:24.530
We made fantastic returns our
first few years.

00:45:24.530 --> 00:45:26.010
50% returns.
 

00:45:26.010 --> 00:45:31.418
And we grew into the biggest
mortgage hedge fund in the

00:45:31.418 --> 00:45:32.420
country.
 

00:45:32.420 --> 00:45:34.670
And things were booming along.
 

00:45:34.670 --> 00:45:37.404
And then suddenly,
there was another crash in

00:45:37.404 --> 00:45:37.840
1998.
 

00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:40.619
So this was the second crash
that I was exposed to.

00:45:40.619 --> 00:45:43.710
So, what happened in this crash?
 

00:45:43.710 --> 00:45:47.367
Well, as I told you,
we were buying mortgages as the

00:45:47.367 --> 00:45:51.456
hedge fund, buying that residual
piece, and buying it with

00:45:51.456 --> 00:45:52.820
borrowed money.
 

00:45:52.820 --> 00:45:55.626
So we would buy the piece,
let's say for $100,

00:45:55.626 --> 00:45:57.309
by borrowing $80 dollars.
 

00:45:57.309 --> 00:45:59.530
So we'd use $20 dollars of
investor capital,

00:45:59.530 --> 00:46:03.190
we'd borrow the other $80,
we'd buy the piece for $100,

00:46:03.190 --> 00:46:06.710
and then we'd leave the piece
with the lender as collateral.

00:46:06.710 --> 00:46:09.153
So if we didn't pay them back
the $80, the guy could keep our

00:46:09.153 --> 00:46:09.480
piece.
 

00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:12.329
So his $100 piece was
protecting his $80 dollar loan.

00:46:12.329 --> 00:46:16.210
So things were swimming along.
 

00:46:16.210 --> 00:46:18.360
We're going to talk a lot about
leverage later.

00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:21.989
Well, in 1998,
one of the big competitors,

00:46:21.989 --> 00:46:24.018
Long Term Capital,
which was founded,

00:46:24.018 --> 00:46:25.768
as I think I mentioned earlier
in the course,

00:46:25.768 --> 00:46:29.679
by Meriwether,
who was the most important,

00:46:29.679 --> 00:46:33.630
famous, fixed income trader on
Wall Street from Salomon.

00:46:33.630 --> 00:46:37.820
And two Nobel Prize winners,
who I've mentioned many times,

00:46:37.820 --> 00:46:39.199
and you're going to hear about
again,

00:46:39.199 --> 00:46:43.199
Merton and Scholes,
creators, especially Scholes,

00:46:43.199 --> 00:46:46.780
of the Black-Scholes model,
the most important tool on Wall

00:46:46.780 --> 00:46:49.657
Street for managing risk,
as we'll discover in a few

00:46:49.657 --> 00:46:50.099
lectures.
 

00:46:50.099 --> 00:46:51.965
So these guys,
the three of them,

00:46:51.965 --> 00:46:55.172
and nine other partners,
12 of them, created this wildly

00:46:55.172 --> 00:46:56.690
successful hedge fund.
 

00:46:56.690 --> 00:46:58.583
And in 1998,
it suddenly went out of

00:46:58.583 --> 00:46:59.179
business.
 

00:46:59.179 --> 00:47:01.371
And in fact,
the government had to step in

00:47:01.371 --> 00:47:03.349
with all the big investment
banks,

00:47:03.349 --> 00:47:05.039
coordinating the big investment
banks,

00:47:05.039 --> 00:47:08.492
to take it over so the whole
market wouldn't crash down

00:47:08.492 --> 00:47:09.260
around it.
 

00:47:09.260 --> 00:47:12.574
We celebrated the crash of Long
Term Capital,

00:47:12.574 --> 00:47:17.019
figuring that was one of our
big competitors out of business

00:47:17.019 --> 00:47:20.110
and now we would have an easier
time.

00:47:20.110 --> 00:47:24.309
But, I remember thinking at the
time that was a mistake.

00:47:24.309 --> 00:47:26.889
But anyway, a few months later,
we got a margin call.

00:47:26.889 --> 00:47:30.240
So suddenly,
on a Friday morning in October

00:47:30.240 --> 00:47:33.585
of '98,
one of our lenders called us up

00:47:33.585 --> 00:47:36.085
and said,
we think the prices have gone

00:47:36.085 --> 00:47:37.998
down,
it's not $100 anymore,

00:47:37.998 --> 00:47:39.460
it's less than that.
 

00:47:39.460 --> 00:47:44.516
We need X million dollars of
extra margin to put for us to

00:47:44.516 --> 00:47:45.670
contribute.
 

00:47:45.670 --> 00:47:48.193
Because the $100 piece
protecting the $80 loan,

00:47:48.193 --> 00:47:50.882
it was no longer $100 piece,
it was a lower piece,

00:47:50.882 --> 00:47:52.530
so there was less cushion.
 

00:47:52.530 --> 00:47:55.010
We need extra cash to have a
bigger cushion.

00:47:55.010 --> 00:47:58.175
So we said, oh this is crazy,
the prices haven't gone down

00:47:58.175 --> 00:47:59.730
that far, that's not fair.
 

00:47:59.730 --> 00:48:02.516
And they said,
you have until 4 o'clock Friday

00:48:02.516 --> 00:48:04.190
afternoon to pay us back.
 

00:48:04.190 --> 00:48:06.489
And if you don't pay us back,
then on next business day,

00:48:06.489 --> 00:48:08.070
which happened to be Tuesday
morning,

00:48:08.070 --> 00:48:10.090
because it was Columbus Day
holiday on Monday,

00:48:10.090 --> 00:48:13.041
we'll just sell off all your
pieces and pay ourselves back

00:48:13.041 --> 00:48:16.409
out of the proceeds the $80 and
give you whatever is left over.

00:48:16.409 --> 00:48:19.103
Well, we figured what was left
over wasn't going to be very

00:48:19.103 --> 00:48:19.429
much.
 

00:48:19.429 --> 00:48:20.889
Because they only needed their
$80.

00:48:20.889 --> 00:48:22.773
So they didn't have an
incentive to sell for the best

00:48:22.773 --> 00:48:24.005
possible price,
although of course,

00:48:24.005 --> 00:48:26.289
they would tell us they'd sell
for the best possible price.

00:48:26.289 --> 00:48:29.199
They wouldn't and it would be a
fire sale.

00:48:29.199 --> 00:48:32.500
So we didn't know what to do.
 

00:48:32.500 --> 00:48:35.820
And we couldn't raise the money
by 4 o'clock on Friday.

00:48:35.820 --> 00:48:37.079
So we called up Warren Buffett.
 

00:48:37.079 --> 00:48:39.460
We said, well this is so
unfair, they're forcing us to

00:48:39.460 --> 00:48:41.840
sell, there's no reason why we
should have to sell.

00:48:41.840 --> 00:48:43.690
This margin call is not proper.
 

00:48:43.690 --> 00:48:45.130
It's not right.
 

00:48:45.130 --> 00:48:46.829
There's no reason we have to
sell.

00:48:46.829 --> 00:48:49.206
What's going to happen is on
Tuesday we're going to be forced

00:48:49.206 --> 00:48:50.949
to sell all of our bonds at the
same time.

00:48:50.949 --> 00:48:52.849
And they're going to all sell
for like $80 or something.

00:48:52.849 --> 00:48:55.170
It's going to be a terrible
blood bath, a fire sale.

00:48:55.170 --> 00:48:56.989
Prices will go for nothing.
 

00:48:56.989 --> 00:48:58.960
We'll be totally wiped out so
unfairly.

00:48:58.960 --> 00:49:00.929
Why don't you buy our firm.
 

00:49:00.929 --> 00:49:04.070
We'll give you half our firm,
some big percentage of our

00:49:04.070 --> 00:49:04.469
firm.
 

00:49:04.469 --> 00:49:06.170
You just make the margin call
for us.

00:49:06.170 --> 00:49:10.679
And then you could have this
firm with these great bonds.

00:49:10.679 --> 00:49:12.059
It's just a travesty.
 

00:49:12.059 --> 00:49:13.789
And it's going to be such a
good investment for you.

00:49:13.789 --> 00:49:17.128
And you can save us and save
the bonds and stop this

00:49:17.128 --> 00:49:17.849
travesty.
 

00:49:17.849 --> 00:49:19.739
And he said excuse me?
 

00:49:19.739 --> 00:49:20.987
And we said,
well it's unfair,

00:49:20.987 --> 00:49:23.010
they're going to force us to
sell on Tuesday.

00:49:23.010 --> 00:49:25.748
And the bonds will go for
nothing when they are perfectly

00:49:25.748 --> 00:49:26.579
valuable bonds.
 

00:49:26.579 --> 00:49:27.590
And they are going to wipe us
out.

00:49:27.590 --> 00:49:29.784
You can prevent that from
happening and own our great

00:49:29.784 --> 00:49:30.079
firm.
 

00:49:30.079 --> 00:49:31.715
And he said,
hell I think,

00:49:31.715 --> 00:49:34.920
I'll wait for Tuesday and buy
the bonds myself.

00:49:34.920 --> 00:49:38.590
And so Warren Buffett didn't
rescue us.

00:49:38.590 --> 00:49:41.610
And so that Tuesday it looked
like we would go out of

00:49:41.610 --> 00:49:42.250
business.
 

00:49:42.250 --> 00:49:46.637
But over the weekend,
we managed to hold an auction

00:49:46.637 --> 00:49:49.360
and sell the bonds ourselves.
 

00:49:49.360 --> 00:49:52.369
So in other classes in
economics, you find out how to

00:49:52.369 --> 00:49:53.469
conduct auctions.
 

00:49:53.469 --> 00:49:55.510
I don't have time to describe
this in great detail.

00:49:55.510 --> 00:49:58.934
But let me just say,
that in a typical auction you

00:49:58.934 --> 00:50:01.730
have to worry about the winners
curse.

00:50:01.730 --> 00:50:04.673
Everybody's thinking,
I'd better not be the highest

00:50:04.673 --> 00:50:07.559
bidder, because that means I
probably overpaid.

00:50:07.559 --> 00:50:10.150
Because those smart guys are
bidding against me.

00:50:10.150 --> 00:50:14.099
So what we did over the weekend
was, we called everybody up and

00:50:14.099 --> 00:50:17.668
we said, we've been forced by a
margin call to sell these

00:50:17.668 --> 00:50:18.369
things.
 

00:50:18.369 --> 00:50:19.909
There's going to be a great
deal for you.

00:50:19.909 --> 00:50:21.974
So why don't you come back from
your vacation,

00:50:21.974 --> 00:50:24.454
one guy came back from
Budapest, one big trader on Wall

00:50:24.454 --> 00:50:24.960
Street.
 

00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:27.909
We got a huge collection of
traders there over the weekend.

00:50:27.909 --> 00:50:29.820
We showed them our bonds so
they could think about it.

00:50:29.820 --> 00:50:32.309
And on Monday we held our
auction.

00:50:32.309 --> 00:50:34.429
We didn't sell everything at
the same time.

00:50:34.429 --> 00:50:36.713
At 12 o'clock,
we sold the first third of our

00:50:36.713 --> 00:50:37.130
bonds.
 

00:50:37.130 --> 00:50:39.079
At 2 o'clock, the second third.
 

00:50:39.079 --> 00:50:42.409
And at 4 o'clock,
the third third.

00:50:42.409 --> 00:50:44.239
Actually, we got a little
behind schedule,

00:50:44.239 --> 00:50:45.309
but that was our plan.
 

00:50:45.309 --> 00:50:47.583
And so what happened was that
at 12 o'clock,

00:50:47.583 --> 00:50:49.170
everybody basically bid $80.
 

00:50:49.170 --> 00:50:53.697
So we said, we're one of the
bidders ourselves,

00:50:53.697 --> 00:50:54.880
of course.
 

00:50:54.880 --> 00:50:57.242
We told everybody,
they all did it by email,

00:50:57.242 --> 00:50:59.880
we emailed everybody back,
you've been outbid.

00:50:59.880 --> 00:51:01.610
Either by someone else or by us.
 

00:51:01.610 --> 00:51:02.449
You've been outbid.
 

00:51:02.449 --> 00:51:03.940
And all these guys,
one from Budapest,

00:51:03.940 --> 00:51:06.820
from all over the world back
there,

00:51:06.820 --> 00:51:08.170
thinking we're going out of
business,

00:51:08.170 --> 00:51:10.289
bidding $80,
they don't get to buy anything.

00:51:10.289 --> 00:51:11.440
So what would they do?
 

00:51:11.440 --> 00:51:13.719
What would they be thinking?
 

00:51:13.719 --> 00:51:16.840
So between 12:00 and 2:00,
we're on the edge of our seats.

00:51:16.840 --> 00:51:17.949
Are they going to bid $80 again?
 

00:51:17.949 --> 00:51:19.380
Which means,
of course, we get nothing.

00:51:19.380 --> 00:51:21.773
Because we just pay back the
loan for $80 and we go out of

00:51:21.773 --> 00:51:23.789
business and our investors go
out of business.

00:51:23.789 --> 00:51:26.440
Or are they going to realize
that they have to bid more in

00:51:26.440 --> 00:51:27.789
order to beat other people.
 

00:51:27.789 --> 00:51:29.590
So we had no idea what was
going to happen.

00:51:29.590 --> 00:51:34.268
But the price was basically $95
a 2 o'clock and $99 at 4

00:51:34.268 --> 00:51:35.119
o'clock.
 

00:51:35.119 --> 00:51:38.559
So we celebrated saving our
firm.

00:51:38.559 --> 00:51:42.556
And it turned out there was
another complication after that,

00:51:42.556 --> 00:51:44.250
which I won't get into.
 

00:51:44.250 --> 00:51:47.789
Which is that the thing had
happened over the holidays.

00:51:47.789 --> 00:51:54.878
And so the next morning,
the buyers didn't get their

00:51:54.878 --> 00:51:55.989
bonds.
 

00:51:55.989 --> 00:51:58.150
Remember, we don't have the
bonds to sell them.

00:51:58.150 --> 00:52:00.300
They're sitting with the person
who lent us the money.

00:52:00.300 --> 00:52:02.820
So it was over a holiday,
and the bonds didn't get

00:52:02.820 --> 00:52:04.260
transferred to the buyers.
 

00:52:04.260 --> 00:52:07.932
And so the prime broker who was
supposed to vouch for all this,

00:52:07.932 --> 00:52:09.768
it was a holiday for him too.
 

00:52:09.768 --> 00:52:11.449
And so the whole thing was a
mess.

00:52:11.449 --> 00:52:13.643
And it's actually quite an
amazing story,

00:52:13.643 --> 00:52:15.510
which I don't have time to
tell.

00:52:15.510 --> 00:52:18.132
But anyway, when the buyers
didn't get their bonds,

00:52:18.132 --> 00:52:21.226
the next morning on Tuesday,
they all got alarmed that maybe

00:52:21.226 --> 00:52:23.010
we didn't even have the bonds.
 

00:52:23.010 --> 00:52:25.559
And so everybody made a margin
call against us.

00:52:25.559 --> 00:52:28.304
And we went from celebrating to
suddenly thinking we're out of

00:52:28.304 --> 00:52:29.070
business again.
 

00:52:29.070 --> 00:52:31.795
But sometimes,
when you're so badly off,

00:52:31.795 --> 00:52:34.590
people realize that they have
to stop.

00:52:34.590 --> 00:52:38.141
And so there was a big
conference call on Wednesday in

00:52:38.141 --> 00:52:40.824
which all of lenders,
the sort of number two people

00:52:40.824 --> 00:52:43.085
at all the big investment banks
got together in the conference

00:52:43.085 --> 00:52:44.543
call,
and they agreed that if they

00:52:44.543 --> 00:52:46.670
all tried to get their money
back at the same time,

00:52:46.670 --> 00:52:47.690
none of them would get it.
 

00:52:47.690 --> 00:52:51.030
And so they waited for us to
gradually work ourselves out of

00:52:51.030 --> 00:52:52.050
the predicament.
 

00:52:52.050 --> 00:52:56.929
So we survived the crash of
1998.

00:52:56.929 --> 00:52:59.420
And then after that,
we had another boom year.

00:52:59.420 --> 00:53:01.840
An incredible year in 1999.
 

00:53:01.840 --> 00:53:10.605
And things kept booming again
for eight years or nine years

00:53:10.605 --> 00:53:12.570
until 2007.
 

00:53:12.570 --> 00:53:15.347
Before, I get to that,
that experience was so seared

00:53:15.347 --> 00:53:17.262
in my mind,
the second crisis,

00:53:17.262 --> 00:53:20.018
the 1998 crisis was so seared
in my mind,

00:53:20.018 --> 00:53:22.809
that I wrote a paper called The
Leverage Cycle.

00:53:22.809 --> 00:53:25.190
In which I said,
what basically happens is

00:53:25.190 --> 00:53:28.559
people borrow a lot of money and
they're very leveraged.

00:53:28.559 --> 00:53:30.699
Then something bad happens in
the economy.

00:53:30.699 --> 00:53:34.070
And the lenders suddenly reduce
the leverage.

00:53:34.070 --> 00:53:36.920
And so the big leveraged
buyers, they go out of business.

00:53:36.920 --> 00:53:40.039
The leverage goes way down.
 

00:53:40.039 --> 00:53:41.829
Lenders will ask for more
collateral.

00:53:41.829 --> 00:53:43.719
And there's also the bad news.
 

00:53:43.719 --> 00:53:46.239
And those three things together
completely crush the market.

00:53:46.239 --> 00:53:48.818
And so lots of people are out
of business and the whole

00:53:48.818 --> 00:53:49.630
thing's a mess.
 

00:53:49.630 --> 00:53:53.469
But then after things settle
down, there's another boom.

00:53:53.469 --> 00:53:56.480
And then it's going to repeat
itself over and over again.

00:53:56.480 --> 00:53:59.949
So that's The Leverage Cycle
story I told in 2003.

00:53:59.949 --> 00:54:02.824
I wrote it right after the
crisis of '98 and I said that

00:54:02.824 --> 00:54:05.079
this crisis,
which in '98 seems to be so

00:54:05.079 --> 00:54:08.400
small, could be repeated on a
much grander scale for the whole

00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:09.000
economy.
 

00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:13.869
So we had these boom years,
right after the crisis of '98.

00:54:13.869 --> 00:54:16.550
And then in 2007,2008,
there was another crash.

00:54:16.550 --> 00:54:18.239
This time on a grand scale.
 

00:54:18.239 --> 00:54:19.710
But it was exactly the same
kind.

00:54:19.710 --> 00:54:21.985
And the last two lectures of
this course are going to be

00:54:21.985 --> 00:54:23.268
about the most recent crisis.
 

00:54:23.268 --> 00:54:28.599
And so we're going to
mathematically reexamine this

00:54:28.599 --> 00:54:30.199
entire story.
 

00:54:30.199 --> 00:54:33.081
And again, after the 2008
crash, when we almost went out

00:54:33.081 --> 00:54:34.969
of business again,
our hedge fund.

00:54:34.969 --> 00:54:37.699
In 2009, we had the best year
we've ever had.

00:54:37.699 --> 00:54:40.949
Better than all those other
years, even in '95.

00:54:40.949 --> 00:54:46.139
So three times in a row.
 

00:54:46.139 --> 00:54:47.976
There's a crash,
a boom, a crash,

00:54:47.976 --> 00:54:49.469
a boom, a crash,
a boom.

00:54:49.469 --> 00:54:54.210
We made back more money in 2009
than we lost in the crisis of

00:54:54.210 --> 00:54:55.159
2007,2008.
 

00:54:55.159 --> 00:54:59.181
So the course has to end with
an explanation of why these

00:54:59.181 --> 00:55:01.909
cycles happened over and over
again.

00:55:01.909 --> 00:55:02.750
It can't be an accident.
 

00:55:02.750 --> 00:55:05.670
It can't be all my fault that
I've been in three of them.

00:55:05.670 --> 00:55:08.018
There's got to be something
systematic going on.

00:55:08.018 --> 00:55:10.809
And that what I've been writing
about it.

00:55:10.809 --> 00:55:12.239
And how I'll end course.
 

00:55:12.239 --> 00:55:13.525
And by the way,
as you'll see,

00:55:13.525 --> 00:55:16.010
I spent a lot of time talking
to the federal reserve,

00:55:16.010 --> 00:55:18.079
and Bernanke,
and Summers,

00:55:18.079 --> 00:55:22.648
and also with the ECB,
the European Central Bank about

00:55:22.648 --> 00:55:24.260
the leverage cycle.
 

00:55:24.260 --> 00:55:28.711
Which I think is generally
becoming recognized as a central

00:55:28.711 --> 00:55:29.480
problem.
 

00:55:29.480 --> 00:55:34.505
But I want to end this lecture
in the next 15 or so minutes,

00:55:34.505 --> 00:55:39.190
20 minutes, by pointing out one
change in the market.

00:55:39.190 --> 00:55:40.780
The next big change in the
market.

00:55:40.780 --> 00:55:44.389
The next wave of securitization.
 

00:55:44.389 --> 00:55:47.494
So, this is the sub prime
market, which we haven't

00:55:47.494 --> 00:55:48.510
mentioned yet.
 

00:55:48.510 --> 00:55:54.630
And which I will now describe.
 

00:55:54.630 --> 00:56:02.610
OK, so what is the sub prime
mortgage market.

00:56:02.610 --> 00:56:06.518
So I already pointed out that
securitization was a great idea.

00:56:06.518 --> 00:56:11.400
Now it was applied,
remember, to prime mortgages.

00:56:11.400 --> 00:56:14.278
You had to be a very reliable
homeowner to get one of those

00:56:14.278 --> 00:56:15.570
Fannie or Freddie loans.
 

00:56:15.570 --> 00:56:18.559
And because those people were
so reliable,

00:56:18.559 --> 00:56:20.420
although they didn't behave
perfectly rationally,

00:56:20.420 --> 00:56:23.413
you had cost and alertness
issues, they still were very

00:56:23.413 --> 00:56:24.190
predictable.
 

00:56:24.190 --> 00:56:31.550
Well, a combination of things
happened in the late '90s.

00:56:31.550 --> 00:56:34.648
Investors began to get the
idea, this has worked out so

00:56:34.648 --> 00:56:38.204
well, and there's so many people
who don't own homes in America

00:56:38.204 --> 00:56:39.639
because they're poor.
 

00:56:39.639 --> 00:56:43.420
Maybe we can extend home
ownership to still more people.

00:56:43.420 --> 00:56:45.815
Of course, they're going to be
riskier, because they're poorer,

00:56:45.815 --> 00:56:46.860
they have less resources.
 

00:56:46.860 --> 00:56:50.193
But we'll charge them a higher
interest rate and that will

00:56:50.193 --> 00:56:52.239
compensate us for the extra
risk.

00:56:52.239 --> 00:56:56.409
The government also saw this as
a great opportunity to help the

00:56:56.409 --> 00:56:56.880
poor.
 

00:56:56.880 --> 00:56:59.559
So this combination of
investors getting the idea and

00:56:59.559 --> 00:57:01.619
the government wanting to
sponsor it,

00:57:01.619 --> 00:57:03.449
led to the creation of a new
market,

00:57:03.449 --> 00:57:06.034
the sub prime market,
which is what I'm going to

00:57:06.034 --> 00:57:06.860
describe now.
 

00:57:06.860 --> 00:57:09.018
And I'm going to talk about
what went wrong,

00:57:09.018 --> 00:57:11.780
or begin to talk about what
went wrong, but I'm going to

00:57:11.780 --> 00:57:14.090
leave most of it for the last
two classes.

00:57:14.090 --> 00:57:16.717
So as I said,
securitization is so important

00:57:16.717 --> 00:57:18.387
because,
let me remind you,

00:57:18.387 --> 00:57:20.440
typically when a bank makes a
loan,

00:57:20.440 --> 00:57:25.480
the bank finds out a lot about
who it is lending to.

00:57:25.480 --> 00:57:30.268
But the bank is a bunch of
managers and stuff.

00:57:30.268 --> 00:57:34.335
The shareholders of the bank
are the people whose money is at

00:57:34.335 --> 00:57:34.809
risk.
 

00:57:34.809 --> 00:57:37.460
They aren't the ones looking at
the loans.

00:57:37.460 --> 00:57:40.032
So if you're a shareholder,
you own stock in a bank,

00:57:40.032 --> 00:57:42.554
two years later the bank is
going to make a loan to

00:57:42.554 --> 00:57:44.219
somebody, risking your money.
 

00:57:44.219 --> 00:57:47.148
And you've got no idea who the
guy is that the bank is lending

00:57:47.148 --> 00:57:47.389
to.
 

00:57:47.389 --> 00:57:50.456
Or what the characteristics are
of the person who is getting a

00:57:50.456 --> 00:57:50.809
loan.
 

00:57:50.809 --> 00:57:54.110
Think of the securitization
when you're buying a pool.

00:57:54.110 --> 00:57:56.996
When you get this pool,
you could be told what are the

00:57:56.996 --> 00:57:59.829
characteristics of all the
homeowners in the pool.

00:57:59.829 --> 00:58:01.380
It's something very concrete.
 

00:58:01.380 --> 00:58:03.760
A bank lends to homeowners,
it lends to businesses.

00:58:03.760 --> 00:58:05.329
It's doing 6,000 things.
 

00:58:05.329 --> 00:58:08.550
Of course, it's risky to have
bank capital.

00:58:08.550 --> 00:58:10.659
You know, equity,
own shares of the bank.

00:58:10.659 --> 00:58:11.690
Because you don't know what
they're doing.

00:58:11.690 --> 00:58:13.018
And they are doing so many
different things.

00:58:13.018 --> 00:58:16.916
You should feel a lot more
comfortable if where your money

00:58:16.916 --> 00:58:19.309
is going is very well
delineated.

00:58:19.309 --> 00:58:21.239
That's the idea of a
securitization.

00:58:21.239 --> 00:58:27.730
It's very well defined where
the money is going.

00:58:27.730 --> 00:58:30.090
So it makes people more willing
to lend.

00:58:30.090 --> 00:58:33.050
Corporate debt,
that's another way of lending

00:58:33.050 --> 00:58:33.590
money.
 

00:58:33.590 --> 00:58:37.557
But if you own bonds in a firm,
you're not the first person to

00:58:37.557 --> 00:58:38.599
get paid back.
 

00:58:38.599 --> 00:58:41.110
The people lending with
collateral get their money

00:58:41.110 --> 00:58:41.518
first.
 

00:58:41.518 --> 00:58:44.217
And if the firm goes bankrupt,
there is a big court case and

00:58:44.217 --> 00:58:46.320
it takes a long time to get your
money back.

00:58:46.320 --> 00:58:47.809
Not in a securitization.
 

00:58:47.809 --> 00:58:52.367
So there are many ways that a
securitization is more

00:58:52.367 --> 00:58:56.570
attractive than lending money
through a bank.

00:58:56.570 --> 00:58:58.489
And that's the reason for the
securitizations.

00:58:58.489 --> 00:59:01.750
Now here are the current
numbers, the 2007 numbers.

00:59:01.750 --> 00:59:04.750
And there haven't been much
securitizations since then.

00:59:04.750 --> 00:59:08.840
So the agencies are now up to
$4 trillion, Fannie and Freddie.

00:59:08.840 --> 00:59:12.507
Now those jumbo loans I told
you about, the big loans that

00:59:12.507 --> 00:59:15.661
the rich people take out,
remember, which was $0.5

00:59:15.661 --> 00:59:18.429
trillion in 2003,
is now $0.8 trillion.

00:59:18.429 --> 00:59:20.769
But there are two more markets
that have been created.

00:59:20.769 --> 00:59:22.829
There's the Alt-A.
 

00:59:22.829 --> 00:59:25.447
Those are people who don't have
credit ratings good enough to

00:59:25.447 --> 00:59:26.800
get the Fannie Freddie loans.
 

00:59:26.800 --> 00:59:28.260
That's $0.8 trillion.
 

00:59:28.260 --> 00:59:30.349
But they are pretty good credit
ratings.

00:59:30.349 --> 00:59:33.409
And then the sub prime
population, of which there were

00:59:33.409 --> 00:59:35.429
$1 trillion loans issued by
2007.

00:59:35.429 --> 00:59:40.619
That's $1.8 trillion of lesser
credit loans that didn't exist

00:59:40.619 --> 00:59:42.090
at all in 2002.
 

00:59:42.090 --> 00:59:45.099
So you add these numbers up,
4.8,0.8, and 1,

00:59:45.099 --> 00:59:49.440
that's $6.6 and $4 trillion of
unsecuritized the banks are just

00:59:49.440 --> 00:59:50.699
holding loans.
 

00:59:50.699 --> 00:59:53.690
So over $10 trillion of loans
as I said.

00:59:53.690 --> 00:59:55.947
OK, and then you add the
commercials on top of that and

00:59:55.947 --> 00:59:58.500
you're getting very close to the
value of the stock market.

00:59:58.500 --> 01:00:03.659
So all right so we've talked
about this.

01:00:03.659 --> 01:00:15.440
The advantages of securitized
loans.

01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:18.579
All right, so how did the sub
prime market began?

01:00:18.579 --> 01:00:20.789
Well, you had to have a few
legal hurdles.

01:00:20.789 --> 01:00:22.974
The first one,
which some countries haven't

01:00:22.974 --> 01:00:25.730
managed to achieve and some
people now are doubting we

01:00:25.730 --> 01:00:28.568
should've ever done,
is it legal to charge a high

01:00:28.568 --> 01:00:31.590
interest rate to someone just
because they're riskier.

01:00:31.590 --> 01:00:33.010
Is that usury?
 

01:00:33.010 --> 01:00:36.347
Or is that a reasonable return,
because you're making a bigger

01:00:36.347 --> 01:00:36.730
risk?
 

01:00:36.730 --> 01:00:41.000
So, there are anti usury laws
on the books.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:44.788
And so in order to make these
loans, they had to become

01:00:44.788 --> 01:00:45.630
legalized.
 

01:00:45.630 --> 01:00:48.717
You had to get congress to pass
a law to say that higher

01:00:48.717 --> 01:00:51.750
interest rate loans for riskier
people is not usury.

01:00:51.750 --> 01:00:55.364
So then, you also had to figure
out the tax treatment,

01:00:55.364 --> 01:00:57.070
which happened in 1986.
 

01:00:57.070 --> 01:01:00.820
And so the first pools were
created in the late '80s,

01:01:00.820 --> 01:01:02.750
the early '90s,
and Kidder Peabody,

01:01:02.750 --> 01:01:06.559
by the way, the firm I worked
for at exactly that time,

01:01:06.559 --> 01:01:11.079
was one of the first creators
of these sub prime like loans.

01:01:11.079 --> 01:01:13.079
So it was very small in the
early days.

01:01:13.079 --> 01:01:14.880
And it worked pretty well in
the early days.

01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:18.074
And, as I said,
by 2007 it had grown to $1

01:01:18.074 --> 01:01:22.750
trillion, 5 million people at an
average loan of $200,000.

01:01:22.750 --> 01:01:28.041
Now, these are people who,
as I said, have bad credit

01:01:28.041 --> 01:01:29.059
ratings.
 

01:01:29.059 --> 01:01:31.500
And so they pay a higher
interest rate.

01:01:31.500 --> 01:01:34.268
Instead of say 6% at the time,
or 5% at the time,

01:01:34.268 --> 01:01:37.730
they might pay 5% or 6% of the
mortgage rate at that time.

01:01:37.730 --> 01:01:40.768
They might pay 8% for the first
two years.

01:01:40.768 --> 01:01:43.300
And then at the end of the
first two years,

01:01:43.300 --> 01:01:45.349
the rate jumps up by another
3%.

01:01:45.349 --> 01:01:46.949
Maybe to LIBOR plus 6%.
 

01:01:46.949 --> 01:01:49.375
LIBOR, remember,
is the inter bank interest

01:01:49.375 --> 01:01:49.780
rate.
 

01:01:49.780 --> 01:01:52.668
So, it's already high,
and then it jumps up after a

01:01:52.668 --> 01:01:53.710
couple of years.
 

01:01:53.710 --> 01:01:57.492
Now, many people have said this
is the kind of predatory

01:01:57.492 --> 01:01:58.179
lending.
 

01:01:58.179 --> 01:02:01.177
That the homeowner is being
lured into taking out a loan,

01:02:01.177 --> 01:02:04.389
not realizing that in a couple
of years, the rate is going to

01:02:04.389 --> 01:02:05.139
go way up.
 

01:02:05.139 --> 01:02:07.400
But actually,
there's some rationale to this.

01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:09.786
It turns out,
that if you've made your

01:02:09.786 --> 01:02:12.561
payments for two or three
consecutive years,

01:02:12.561 --> 01:02:16.690
the market thinks you're not
such a subprime person anymore.

01:02:16.690 --> 01:02:19.594
After all, many subprime
borrower are people who are

01:02:19.594 --> 01:02:20.050
young.
 

01:02:20.050 --> 01:02:22.280
They didn't pay their credit
cards in college.

01:02:22.280 --> 01:02:24.059
Or they defaulted on something.
 

01:02:24.059 --> 01:02:26.510
And once they're married,
have a house,

01:02:26.510 --> 01:02:29.798
have kids, and they pay for
three consecutive years,

01:02:29.798 --> 01:02:32.701
the market figures,
well these people are much

01:02:32.701 --> 01:02:33.539
better.
 

01:02:33.539 --> 01:02:36.878
So we'll give them another
loan, they can refinance into a

01:02:36.878 --> 01:02:38.869
loan with a lower interest rate.
 

01:02:38.869 --> 01:02:40.789
Because they are no longer
considered subprime.

01:02:40.789 --> 01:02:43.659
Maybe they moved to Alt-A or
maybe even into prime.

01:02:43.659 --> 01:02:48.023
So you could count on 70%,
by the end of the third year,

01:02:48.023 --> 01:02:50.800
of people refinancing their
loan.

01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:54.768
During all those years from the
90s and the early 2000s.

01:02:54.768 --> 01:02:57.809
So you'd be left with 30% of
the people who didn't refinance.

01:02:57.809 --> 01:02:59.369
Why didn't they refinance?
 

01:02:59.369 --> 01:03:00.583
Probably because there's
something wrong with them,

01:03:00.583 --> 01:03:01.920
they were missing their loans
[correction: payments].

01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:05.219
They were much riskier than the
original pool to begin with.

01:03:05.219 --> 01:03:06.719
So naturally,
you're going to charge them a

01:03:06.719 --> 01:03:07.539
higher interest rate.
 

01:03:07.539 --> 01:03:10.277
So it's not such a crazy thing
that the interest rate went up

01:03:10.277 --> 01:03:11.099
after two years.
 

01:03:11.099 --> 01:03:13.940
It isn't necessarily a sign of
predatory lending.

01:03:13.940 --> 01:03:16.090
OK, now how do these loans get
started?

01:03:16.090 --> 01:03:17.949
There's somebody called an
originator.

01:03:17.949 --> 01:03:22.367
A broker would find a
homeowner, a subprime homeowner,

01:03:22.367 --> 01:03:26.869
and then go to originator who
would create the deal.

01:03:26.869 --> 01:03:29.559
Now what would the deal be?
 

01:03:29.559 --> 01:03:33.693
The pool would be a bunch of
subprime homeowners and you'd

01:03:33.693 --> 01:03:36.449
have to get some data on the
people.

01:03:36.449 --> 01:03:37.949
You'd have to figure out do
they have a job?

01:03:37.949 --> 01:03:39.070
What's their debt?
 

01:03:39.070 --> 01:03:40.610
What's their income?
 

01:03:40.610 --> 01:03:42.050
Things like that.
 

01:03:42.050 --> 01:03:45.135
And all that would have to be
reported to the potential

01:03:45.135 --> 01:03:45.650
buyers.
 

01:03:45.650 --> 01:03:49.358
So a buyer in the shares of
these subprime pools would get a

01:03:49.358 --> 01:03:49.800
list.
 

01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:50.849
Not by name.
 

01:03:50.849 --> 01:03:52.610
You can't reveal the name of
the homeowners.

01:03:52.610 --> 01:03:54.768
But what the zip code is of
every house.

01:03:54.768 --> 01:03:57.661
And what the basic
qualifications were of the

01:03:57.661 --> 01:03:58.449
homeowner.
 

01:03:58.449 --> 01:03:59.320
Do they have a job?
 

01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:00.949
What's the loan to value on the
loan?

01:04:00.949 --> 01:04:02.719
What's their debt to income
ratio?

01:04:02.719 --> 01:04:03.780
Stuff like that.
 

01:04:03.780 --> 01:04:09.349
Now, the servicer,
who's often the originator.

01:04:09.349 --> 01:04:13.460
Let's say the originator is an
investment bank.

01:04:13.460 --> 01:04:17.489
The servicer might be the same
investment bank or a specialty

01:04:17.489 --> 01:04:18.230
servicer.
 

01:04:18.230 --> 01:04:21.670
What they do is just what the
banks did in the Fannie Freddie

01:04:21.670 --> 01:04:22.130
story.
 

01:04:22.130 --> 01:04:23.840
They're the ones sending the
letters,

01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:26.739
telling people they have to
pay, collecting the money,

01:04:26.739 --> 01:04:29.909
and dividing it up to the
bondholders,

01:04:29.909 --> 01:04:31.820
as we'll describe in a second.
 

01:04:31.820 --> 01:04:37.369
And they have one extra job.
 

01:04:37.369 --> 01:04:40.615
Because they're subprime loans,
you can expect a bigger

01:04:40.615 --> 01:04:42.539
percentage of them to default.
 

01:04:42.539 --> 01:04:45.159
And when people default,
sometimes they can't make the

01:04:45.159 --> 01:04:47.780
payments, they lose their job,
something like that.

01:04:47.780 --> 01:04:51.059
The servicer is given the right
to modify the loan.

01:04:51.059 --> 01:04:53.378
The servicer can say,
OK I understand you can't pay,

01:04:53.378 --> 01:04:55.380
of course you can't pay,
you're out of a job,

01:04:55.380 --> 01:04:56.699
you don't have any money.
 

01:04:56.699 --> 01:04:59.465
There's no point of us throwing
you out of the house right away,

01:04:59.465 --> 01:05:00.869
maybe you'll get the job back.
 

01:05:00.869 --> 01:05:03.880
So we'll work out a deal where
we delay your payments,

01:05:03.880 --> 01:05:06.670
or maybe reduce the payments,
maybe even we reduce the

01:05:06.670 --> 01:05:10.148
principle that you owe,
because in the end that's going

01:05:10.148 --> 01:05:12.599
to make our bondholders more
money.

01:05:12.599 --> 01:05:15.471
So the all the bondholders have
no right to talk to the

01:05:15.471 --> 01:05:16.110
homeowner.
 

01:05:16.110 --> 01:05:17.679
They don't know even though the
homeowner's name.

01:05:17.679 --> 01:05:19.652
But the servicer who is sending
the homeowner letters all the

01:05:19.652 --> 01:05:21.853
time and getting the money,
of course the servicer knows

01:05:21.853 --> 01:05:23.889
the name and has the right to
modify the loan.

01:05:23.889 --> 01:05:26.949
And if the homeowner doesn't
pay and the loan is not

01:05:26.949 --> 01:05:28.543
modified,
because the servicer doesn't

01:05:28.543 --> 01:05:31.773
think it's worth it,
then the servicer can kick the

01:05:31.773 --> 01:05:34.150
homeowner out of his house.
 

01:05:34.150 --> 01:05:38.692
And take the house and sell it
and pay the proceeds to the

01:05:38.692 --> 01:05:39.250
fund.
 

01:05:39.250 --> 01:05:42.547
But there's one extremely
interesting provision that if

01:05:42.547 --> 01:05:45.983
the homeowner is not paying,
during the time the homeowner

01:05:45.983 --> 01:05:48.449
doesn't pay,
the servicer has to make the

01:05:48.449 --> 01:05:52.380
payments for the homeowner into
the trust for the bond holders.

01:05:52.380 --> 01:05:55.710
That's supposed to give the
servicer an incentive to hurry

01:05:55.710 --> 01:05:59.157
up and figure out what to do to
change the loan or throw the

01:05:59.157 --> 01:06:00.210
homeowner out.
 

01:06:00.210 --> 01:06:03.054
And of course,
when the house is finally sold,

01:06:03.054 --> 01:06:06.469
the servicer can recoup his
advance payments out of the

01:06:06.469 --> 01:06:08.050
proceeds of the sale.
 

01:06:08.050 --> 01:06:13.940
And then later,
the rest of the money goes to

01:06:13.940 --> 01:06:16.349
the bondholders.
 

01:06:16.349 --> 01:06:19.257
Now, the rating agencies played
an important role in determining

01:06:19.257 --> 01:06:21.150
the ratings that I'm about to
describe.

01:06:21.150 --> 01:06:23.099
So here's the thing would look.
 

01:06:23.099 --> 01:06:28.077
You have all the homeowners
stuck into a pool,

01:06:28.077 --> 01:06:30.070
all those loans.
 

01:06:30.070 --> 01:06:31.750
I'm going to go for ten more
minutes, by the way.

01:06:31.750 --> 01:06:34.768
You have all these loans stuck
in a pool.

01:06:34.768 --> 01:06:36.797
So the money would be coming
in, the homeowners,

01:06:36.797 --> 01:06:39.387
remember, are paying this high
interest rate because they are

01:06:39.387 --> 01:06:40.380
subprime borrowers.
 

01:06:40.380 --> 01:06:43.110
So there's $100 of loans that
went out.

01:06:43.110 --> 01:06:44.670
Let's say each loans is for
$1.00.

01:06:44.670 --> 01:06:47.889
Where does the originator get
the money to lend to the

01:06:47.889 --> 01:06:48.679
homeowners?
 

01:06:48.679 --> 01:06:51.800
Well, the originator is at the
same time creating the bonds.

01:06:51.800 --> 01:06:55.478
So there'd be AA bonds,
AA, A, BBB, with a bunch of

01:06:55.478 --> 01:06:58.862
minuses too, the over
collateralization and the

01:06:58.862 --> 01:06:59.820
residual.
 

01:06:59.820 --> 01:07:03.159
So you'd create $81 of AAA
bonds.

01:07:03.159 --> 01:07:06.469
These guys would pay that
LIBOR, the inter bank rate,

01:07:06.469 --> 01:07:08.570
which let's say was 5% percent.
 

01:07:08.570 --> 01:07:11.777
Plus a tiny bit,
20 basis points,

01:07:11.777 --> 01:07:12.780
so 5.2%.
 

01:07:12.780 --> 01:07:15.739
The AA would pay a little bit
more than that.

01:07:15.739 --> 01:07:17.659
And the single a little bit
more than.

01:07:17.659 --> 01:07:20.739
That's probably misprint,
that should be LIBOR plus 10.

01:07:20.739 --> 01:07:23.092
LIBOR plus 20,
LIBOR plus 30,

01:07:23.092 --> 01:07:26.119
and then the BBBs,
LIBOR plus 130.

01:07:26.119 --> 01:07:30.940
So you'd issue $81 worth of
triple AAAs, $7 of AAs,

01:07:30.940 --> 01:07:33.159
$5 of As, $5 of BBBs.
 

01:07:33.159 --> 01:07:35.489
That adds up to $88, $93, $98.
 

01:07:35.489 --> 01:07:40.070
You're only getting $98.
 

01:07:40.070 --> 01:07:43.260
So you've got $98 worth of
bonds that you used.

01:07:43.260 --> 01:07:47.139
So the originator has sold
these bonds for $98.

01:07:47.139 --> 01:07:51.039
He's got to lend $100,
so he's $2.00 short so far.

01:07:51.039 --> 01:07:53.637
But you notice that the
interest rate all these

01:07:53.637 --> 01:07:57.139
bondholders are getting is 5%
percent, or a little bit more.

01:07:57.139 --> 01:07:59.050
The homeowners are paying 8%.
 

01:07:59.050 --> 01:08:01.842
So there's extra money coming
in that doesn't have to go to

01:08:01.842 --> 01:08:02.710
the bondholders.
 

01:08:02.710 --> 01:08:06.769
So there's this residual piece
that gets the right to get the

01:08:06.769 --> 01:08:08.530
extra interest payments.
 

01:08:08.530 --> 01:08:11.967
So the originator either holds
residual piece or finds some

01:08:11.967 --> 01:08:15.170
hedge fund and says,
OK, you buy the residual piece.

01:08:15.170 --> 01:08:18.199
And maybe the residual piece is
worth $5.00.

01:08:18.199 --> 01:08:20.368
So $98 plus $5.00 is $103.
 

01:08:20.368 --> 01:08:23.250
So the originator has gotten
$103.

01:08:23.250 --> 01:08:25.894
The broker's fees,
remember the broker had to find

01:08:25.894 --> 01:08:27.460
the homeowners,
gets $2.00.

01:08:27.460 --> 01:08:29.029
So now he's only got $101.
 

01:08:29.029 --> 01:08:31.578
So he lends the $100 and
pockets $1.00.

01:08:31.578 --> 01:08:35.706
So the originator would get 1%
bear no risk for his work in

01:08:35.706 --> 01:08:37.130
creating the deal.
 

01:08:37.130 --> 01:08:41.920
Now, how can these AAA pieces
be rated AAA?

01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:44.390
Now, to be rated AAA mean
there's a one in a hundred

01:08:44.390 --> 01:08:46.960
chance, or something,
that you're going to default.

01:08:46.960 --> 01:08:56.069
So how could that possibly be,
when the loans are so risky?

01:08:56.069 --> 01:09:00.590
Well, what happens if somebody
defaults?

01:09:00.590 --> 01:09:02.229
So this is the calculation.
 

01:09:02.229 --> 01:09:07.100
What happens if somebody
defaults?

01:09:07.100 --> 01:09:10.764
Well, if you haven't paid for
the first 30 days,

01:09:10.764 --> 01:09:12.868
that happens quite often.
 

01:09:12.868 --> 01:09:14.646
But if you go,
60 days without paying,

01:09:14.646 --> 01:09:16.038
nothing bad happens to you.
 

01:09:16.038 --> 01:09:20.521
After 60 days,
you get a letter saying you're

01:09:20.521 --> 01:09:26.430
delinquent and a note is being
made that's going to have an

01:09:26.430 --> 01:09:29.689
impact on your credit score.
 

01:09:29.689 --> 01:09:32.520
So being 60 days delinquent,
seriously delinquent,

01:09:32.520 --> 01:09:34.078
is bad for the homeowner.
 

01:09:34.078 --> 01:09:36.837
After 90 days,
you're considered likely to

01:09:36.837 --> 01:09:37.510
default.
 

01:09:37.510 --> 01:09:39.993
And so you get these very
threatening letters from the

01:09:39.993 --> 01:09:40.510
servicer.
 

01:09:40.510 --> 01:09:42.671
And after 120 days,
the servicer can start to try

01:09:42.671 --> 01:09:44.158
and throw you out of the house.
 

01:09:44.158 --> 01:09:46.056
But to throw you out of the
house, maybe they have to go to

01:09:46.056 --> 01:09:47.658
court, they have to do a whole
bunch of things.

01:09:47.658 --> 01:09:49.920
And so in those days,
it took 18 months,

01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:52.122
14 more months,
after the four already,

01:09:52.122 --> 01:09:53.630
to throw somebody out.
 

01:09:53.630 --> 01:09:56.823
It now, has taken on average,
a couple of years,

01:09:56.823 --> 01:09:57.979
or three years.
 

01:09:57.979 --> 01:10:00.070
It's getting more and more
complicated to throw somebody

01:10:00.070 --> 01:10:00.300
out.
 

01:10:00.300 --> 01:10:01.590
Which we're going to get to in
a minute.

01:10:01.590 --> 01:10:09.510
So you could be thrown out
after say 18 months.

01:10:09.510 --> 01:10:11.988
Now what happens if you're
thrown out of the house.

01:10:11.988 --> 01:10:14.319
Let's say, the house is sold
for $0.80.

01:10:14.319 --> 01:10:20.948
When you originally had a $1.00
loan.

01:10:20.948 --> 01:10:25.051
Well, during the time the guy
hasn't paid for that year and a

01:10:25.051 --> 01:10:29.153
half, if it was an 8% coupon,
that means a year and a half is

01:10:29.153 --> 01:10:29.699
12%.
 

01:10:29.699 --> 01:10:31.538
So $0.12 the guy hasn't paid.
 

01:10:31.538 --> 01:10:33.920
So the servicers had to pay up
the $0.12.

01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:36.500
And then you have to hire a
broker to resell the house.

01:10:36.500 --> 01:10:38.069
That costs six more cents.
 

01:10:38.069 --> 01:10:40.805
And the guy probably didn't
pays taxes for the whole year

01:10:40.805 --> 01:10:41.439
and a half.
 

01:10:41.439 --> 01:10:43.542
So that's another three cents
or so, that you've lost,

01:10:43.542 --> 01:10:44.970
depending on what the tax rate
is.

01:10:44.970 --> 01:10:48.295
So you've lost $0.12 of
servicer advances,

01:10:48.295 --> 01:10:52.188
$0.06 to the broker,
that's $0.18 $0.03 cents for

01:10:52.188 --> 01:10:54.460
the taxes, that's $0.21.
 

01:10:54.460 --> 01:10:56.689
And the house only sold for
$0.80 instead of 100.

01:10:56.689 --> 01:11:00.279
That's $0.41 cents you've
already lost.

01:11:00.279 --> 01:11:02.279
That's a sort good scenario.
 

01:11:02.279 --> 01:11:04.350
You've already lost 40%.
 

01:11:04.350 --> 01:11:09.729
So the bondholders know that
with this scenario they're going

01:11:09.729 --> 01:11:12.779
to lose 40% about of their loan.
 

01:11:12.779 --> 01:11:16.073
Where does that 40% is $0.40
cents, because remember there's

01:11:16.073 --> 01:11:19.368
only $1.00 loan to that guy,
where does that come out of?

01:11:19.368 --> 01:11:24.118
Well, there was this over
collateralization of $2.00.

01:11:24.118 --> 01:11:27.863
This is extra money pouring
into the deal because everyone

01:11:27.863 --> 01:11:30.029
else is paying a higher coupon.
 

01:11:30.029 --> 01:11:35.291
So you take the money out of
this extra cash flow that's

01:11:35.291 --> 01:11:36.439
coming in.
 

01:11:36.439 --> 01:11:38.944
If the default,
the lost $0.40 is more than the

01:11:38.944 --> 01:11:42.212
extra cash flow coming in that
year, then you reduce the over

01:11:42.212 --> 01:11:43.409
collateralization.
 

01:11:43.409 --> 01:11:46.149
There was $2.00 dollars.
 

01:11:46.149 --> 01:11:49.837
These bondholders were only
owed $98 and there's $100 of

01:11:49.837 --> 01:11:51.180
loans outstanding.
 

01:11:51.180 --> 01:11:54.831
So you could lose $2.00 of
loans and still have as much

01:11:54.831 --> 01:11:57.130
loans backing these bondholders.
 

01:11:57.130 --> 01:12:00.823
But once you get to the next
dollar, you're going to take the

01:12:00.823 --> 01:12:02.979
$0.40 first out of the BBB
piece.

01:12:02.979 --> 01:12:06.673
So as more and more houses go
under, you go through the over

01:12:06.673 --> 01:12:09.180
collateralization,
the extra interest.

01:12:09.180 --> 01:12:11.970
Then you start taking things
out of the BBB piece.

01:12:11.970 --> 01:12:14.926
After you wipe that out,
then you go to the A piece,

01:12:14.926 --> 01:12:17.479
and then the AA and finally go
to the AAA.

01:12:17.479 --> 01:12:22.047
So how could you possibly think
those pieces at the top were

01:12:22.047 --> 01:12:22.590
AAAs?
 

01:12:22.590 --> 01:12:25.819
Well because let's do a simple
calculation.

01:12:25.819 --> 01:12:28.560
Actually, they look incredibly
safe when you start to think

01:12:28.560 --> 01:12:29.078
about it.
 

01:12:29.078 --> 01:12:33.976
All this extra interest and the
over collateralization and stuff

01:12:33.976 --> 01:12:37.010
like that it's sort of 8%
protection.

01:12:37.010 --> 01:12:44.399
And on top of that,
you've got the lower pieces

01:12:44.399 --> 01:12:49.220
bearing the original losses.
 

01:12:49.220 --> 01:12:54.090
OK, so even if you expected 40%
percent of the homeowners to

01:12:54.090 --> 01:12:57.640
default, which is an
astronomical figure.

01:12:57.640 --> 01:13:00.076
It was typically,
in the past,

01:13:00.076 --> 01:13:02.260
less than a few percent.
 

01:13:02.260 --> 01:13:04.962
Even if you thought 40$ of the
homeowners would be thrown out

01:13:04.962 --> 01:13:07.654
of their houses,
and 40% of each homeowner was

01:13:07.654 --> 01:13:11.449
going to be lost in the scenario
we just described of the 40%

01:13:11.449 --> 01:13:16.680
loss,
40% times 40% is only 16%.

01:13:16.680 --> 01:13:19.612
But the AAA pieces are
protected by 8% and then are

01:13:19.612 --> 01:13:22.720
protected by another 19%,
because they're only the top

01:13:22.720 --> 01:13:23.189
81%.
 

01:13:23.189 --> 01:13:27.420
So 16% doesn't come anywhere
close to the AAA guys.

01:13:27.420 --> 01:13:30.980
So that, in 2007,
was a horrible scenario to

01:13:30.980 --> 01:13:31.810
imagine.
 

01:13:31.810 --> 01:13:35.319
That 40% of the homeowners,
they are 5 million homeowners.

01:13:35.319 --> 01:13:38.514
That means 2 million people
tossed on to the streets,

01:13:38.514 --> 01:13:42.078
losing 40% of each of the homes
and you don't come close to

01:13:42.078 --> 01:13:43.430
touching the AAAs.
 

01:13:43.430 --> 01:13:48.532
That's why it seemed like they
should be AAAs and so many

01:13:48.532 --> 01:13:51.630
people were willing to buy them.
 

01:13:51.630 --> 01:13:54.439
I've got one more thing to add
to this background piece.

01:13:54.439 --> 01:13:56.630
The credit default swap.
 

01:13:56.630 --> 01:13:59.189
By the way, things are even
rosier than that,

01:13:59.189 --> 01:14:02.237
at least looked at from the
point of view of 2007 Because

01:14:02.237 --> 01:14:05.122
remember,
70% of the people were always

01:14:05.122 --> 01:14:05.970
prepaying.
 

01:14:05.970 --> 01:14:08.319
That means you got 70% of your
money back for sure.

01:14:08.319 --> 01:14:11.975
So you only had 30% of the
people left who could possibly

01:14:11.975 --> 01:14:12.630
default.
 

01:14:12.630 --> 01:14:17.978
So instead of having 40%
default, you'd probably have 40%

01:14:17.978 --> 01:14:19.220
of the 30%.
 

01:14:19.220 --> 01:14:22.797
So you see, you could easily
imagine that your AAAs were

01:14:22.797 --> 01:14:23.970
completely safe.
 

01:14:23.970 --> 01:14:27.204
And so I think the credit
rating agencies didn't do such a

01:14:27.204 --> 01:14:30.100
horrible thing rating these
things as people say.

01:14:30.100 --> 01:14:32.130
But I haven't finished the
story.

01:14:32.130 --> 01:14:33.939
So watch what happens.
 

01:14:33.939 --> 01:14:37.733
So a new invention that
happened in the end of 2005 was

01:14:37.733 --> 01:14:39.560
the credit default swap.
 

01:14:39.560 --> 01:14:42.328
CDS they are called,
which you've heard a lot.

01:14:42.328 --> 01:14:44.340
So what is a credit default
swap?

01:14:44.340 --> 01:14:47.220
It's just insurance on each of
these bonds.

01:14:47.220 --> 01:14:50.738
So a credit default swap on the
BBB would say,

01:14:50.738 --> 01:14:53.680
if there's a dollar of
principal lost,

01:14:53.680 --> 01:14:55.899
because the homeowner's
default, you take the loss out

01:14:55.899 --> 01:14:59.426
of the triple BBB,
you can get insurance on the

01:14:59.426 --> 01:15:00.560
triple BBB.
 

01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:04.770
A CDS just is a promise to pay
a dollar for every dollar that's

01:15:04.770 --> 01:15:06.470
lost in the triple BBB.
 

01:15:06.470 --> 01:15:09.287
And the CDS on the A is a
promise to pay a dollar for

01:15:09.287 --> 01:15:11.239
every dollar that's lost on the
A.

01:15:11.239 --> 01:15:15.090
So that was a huge market.
 

01:15:15.090 --> 01:15:17.310
It suddenly took off in 2005.
 

01:15:17.310 --> 01:15:20.859
And then there was an index
that was created in 2006.

01:15:20.859 --> 01:15:24.319
So these are insurance on
particular deals.

01:15:24.319 --> 01:15:26.042
But if you put all the
insurance together,

01:15:26.042 --> 01:15:28.310
you can make an index of what
the insurance is like.

01:15:28.310 --> 01:15:32.050
And so you can tell how
valuable the bonds are.

01:15:32.050 --> 01:15:34.912
Because if you see that the
insurance premium is changing

01:15:34.912 --> 01:15:37.673
you know that people realize
there's a bigger chance of

01:15:37.673 --> 01:15:38.850
default of the BBB.
 

01:15:38.850 --> 01:15:41.363
So the insurance market,
the index of it,

01:15:41.363 --> 01:15:45.010
is going to tell you a lot of
information about what what's

01:15:45.010 --> 01:15:47.210
going on in the subprime world.
 

01:15:47.210 --> 01:15:51.560
OK, now, I don't have time to
get to these legal issues.

01:15:51.560 --> 01:15:54.550
But I want to add the last fact.
 

01:15:54.550 --> 01:15:58.270
Things seemed to be going so
well in the subprime world from

01:15:58.270 --> 01:16:01.027
the late 80s,
early 90s, all through 2000,

01:16:01.027 --> 01:16:04.648
all through the middle 2000s
that people got more ambitious

01:16:04.648 --> 01:16:05.210
still.
 

01:16:05.210 --> 01:16:06.430
So what did they do?
 

01:16:06.430 --> 01:16:08.050
They created CDOs.
 

01:16:08.050 --> 01:16:11.479
So what are CDOs now?
 

01:16:11.479 --> 01:16:15.090
Remember, we had these loans
that got cut up into bonds.

01:16:15.090 --> 01:16:17.130
There was insurance in the
bonds.

01:16:17.130 --> 01:16:20.960
So people said,
let's take the BBB bonds.

01:16:20.960 --> 01:16:23.252
They're sort of at the bottom,
they're protected a little bit,

01:16:23.252 --> 01:16:24.078
but near the bottom.
 

01:16:24.078 --> 01:16:26.770
Let's cut those up into
different pieces.

01:16:26.770 --> 01:16:30.362
So we take BBB bonds from all
different deals,

01:16:30.362 --> 01:16:34.832
we put those into another pool,
and now we cut those into

01:16:34.832 --> 01:16:36.510
different pieces.
 

01:16:36.510 --> 01:16:40.149
And so you might have a pool
that's from California,

01:16:40.149 --> 01:16:42.788
and a pool that's from Detroit,
and a pool that's from Florida,

01:16:42.788 --> 01:16:44.470
that would just be a horrible
combination,

01:16:44.470 --> 01:16:47.279
or a pool that's from Illinois
and Ohio and stuff like that.

01:16:47.279 --> 01:16:48.569
You put them all together.
 

01:16:48.569 --> 01:16:53.184
And now, somehow the market
decided that we could cut these

01:16:53.184 --> 01:16:56.684
into AAAs, AAs,
and As with the same logic as

01:16:56.684 --> 01:16:57.560
before.
 

01:16:57.560 --> 01:17:01.020
But, this turned out to be
catastrophic.

01:17:01.020 --> 01:17:03.619
In fact, the market went one
step further,

01:17:03.619 --> 01:17:07.362
and not only took the BBBs that
we said before and made them

01:17:07.362 --> 01:17:10.090
collateral for more AAA bonds
and CDOs.

01:17:10.090 --> 01:17:14.265
But then took the As from this,
which came from the BBBs and

01:17:14.265 --> 01:17:17.380
cut those up into more AAAs,
CDO squareds.

01:17:17.380 --> 01:17:22.037
So that was the mortgage
market, the subprime mortgage

01:17:22.037 --> 01:17:22.828
market.
 

01:17:22.828 --> 01:17:27.230
So you see, that there's a
tremendous amount of synthetic

01:17:27.230 --> 01:17:27.859
stuff.
 

01:17:27.859 --> 01:17:31.028
By the way, these insurance
pieces, if you're writing

01:17:31.028 --> 01:17:34.806
insurance, you're promising to
pay basically what the BBBs pay,

01:17:34.806 --> 01:17:36.939
so it's like an artificial BBB.
 

01:17:36.939 --> 01:17:41.332
So they created the synthetic
BBBs and used those to cut up

01:17:41.332 --> 01:17:43.149
too in the CDO market.
 

01:17:43.149 --> 01:17:50.000
OK, so I'm going to stop now
with one final word.

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:54.877
So the subprime market of $1
trillion, plus the Alt-A market,

01:17:54.877 --> 01:17:58.050
became the new frontier of
mortgages.

01:17:58.050 --> 01:18:00.652
And as I said,
everything went swimmingly in

01:18:00.652 --> 01:18:02.590
the 1990s and the early 2000s.
 

01:18:02.590 --> 01:18:06.238
And then in 2007,
there was a tremendous crash.

01:18:06.238 --> 01:18:10.005
So in January of 2007,
February of 2007,

01:18:10.005 --> 01:18:14.930
the BBB insurance index
plummeted from 100 to 75.

01:18:14.930 --> 01:18:16.775
At that point,
everyone declared,

01:18:16.775 --> 01:18:18.970
oh this is just the subprime
market.

01:18:18.970 --> 01:18:20.630
It's small thing,
don't worry about it.

01:18:20.630 --> 01:18:22.109
Bernanke said there's no
problem.

01:18:22.109 --> 01:18:24.310
The stock market didn't blip at
all.

01:18:24.310 --> 01:18:28.069
It continued on until October
of 2007 when it hit its high.

01:18:28.069 --> 01:18:30.800
The world took notice of the
subprime collapse,

01:18:30.800 --> 01:18:33.038
but everybody said it wouldn't
amount to anything,

01:18:33.038 --> 01:18:35.551
because everybody
underestimated the importance of

01:18:35.551 --> 01:18:36.680
the mortgage market.
 

01:18:36.680 --> 01:18:39.302
So we're going to see in the
last two lectures,

01:18:39.302 --> 01:18:42.269
how this unraveling of the
subprime market led to the

01:18:42.269 --> 01:18:44.380
unraveling of the entire
economy.

01:18:44.380 --> 01:18:47.078
And we're going to show that
everything that I've described,

01:18:47.078 --> 01:18:49.891
although it sounds very much
more complicated with subprimes

01:18:49.891 --> 01:18:52.180
than it did with the prime
mortgages earlier,

01:18:52.180 --> 01:18:57.592
is really when you get down to
it, the same story of leverage

01:18:57.592 --> 01:19:00.210
and crashes and then booms.
 

01:19:00.210 --> 01:19:03.560
And we're going to begin the
next class by talking about the

01:19:03.560 --> 01:19:06.685
mathematics of the prime
mortgage market and prepayments

01:19:06.685 --> 01:19:08.220
and how to value those.
 

01:19:08.220 --> 01:19:12.148
And gradually we're going to
get to the crisis and what

01:19:12.148 --> 01:19:16.439
caused it and what we should do
to prevent future crises.

01:19:16.439 --> 01:19:17.399
Thanks.
 

01:19:17.399 --> 01:19:22.000

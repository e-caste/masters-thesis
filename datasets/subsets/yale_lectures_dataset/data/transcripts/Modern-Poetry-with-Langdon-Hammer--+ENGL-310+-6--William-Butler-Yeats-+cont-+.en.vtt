00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:02.810
Professor Langdon
Hammer: Let's see.

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:08.330
On your handout I have Yeats on
the subject of magic.

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:13.628
This goes back in time from the
text we were discussing last

00:00:13.628 --> 00:00:17.310
time in the teens and twenties
to 1901.

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:24.337
And I wanted to introduce it to
you as some of Yeats's

00:00:24.337 --> 00:00:31.629
reflections on the general
question of the occult and of

00:00:31.629 --> 00:00:37.807
the symbolic in his poetry;
a kind of preparation in his

00:00:37.807 --> 00:00:41.720
thinking for some of the poems
we discussed last time,

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.010
such as "The Second Coming."
 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.358
He says, "I believe in the
practice and philosophy of what

00:00:47.358 --> 00:00:51.034
we have agreed to call magic,
in what I must call the

00:00:51.034 --> 00:00:55.145
evocation of spirits,
though I do not know what they

00:00:55.145 --> 00:00:58.290
are."
That's important, I think.

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:02.083
And you remember Yeats in "The
Second Coming," there's a beast

00:01:02.083 --> 00:01:06.001
that's kind of--He doesn't know
what it is, and here he's saying

00:01:06.001 --> 00:01:07.370
something similar.
 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:11.040
He also speaks of his belief
"in the power of creating

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.365
magical illusions,
in the visions of truth in the

00:01:14.365 --> 00:01:17.689
depths of the mind when the eyes
are closed;

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:21.444
and I believe in three
doctrines," which he will

00:01:21.444 --> 00:01:26.437
conveniently put forward for us:
(1) That the borders of

00:01:26.437 --> 00:01:29.998
our mind [and he has that in the
singular there]

00:01:29.998 --> 00:01:33.824
are ever shifting,
and that many minds can flow

00:01:33.824 --> 00:01:37.655
into one another,
as it were, [that's probably an

00:01:37.655 --> 00:01:41.885
important qualification]
and create or reveal a single

00:01:41.885 --> 00:01:44.040
mind, a single energy.
 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.599
[In effect, at work in our
common imaginations.]

00:01:48.599 --> 00:01:51.689
(2) That the borders of our
minds are shifting,

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.048
and that our memories are part
of one great memory,

00:01:55.048 --> 00:01:58.340
[what he calls]
the memory of Nature herself.

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.724
(3) [And this is the most
important thing.]

00:02:01.724 --> 00:02:06.397
That this great mind and great
memory [this kind of unitary

00:02:06.397 --> 00:02:09.137
repertoire of spirits and
memories]

00:02:09.137 --> 00:02:11.151
can be evoked by symbols.
 

00:02:11.151 --> 00:02:17.337
[From Magic]
This is something poetry can

00:02:17.337 --> 00:02:20.430
activate and draw upon.
 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.934
That "Spiritus Mundi" that
Yeats refers to in "The Second

00:02:24.934 --> 00:02:28.231
Coming," well,
this is Yeats talking about

00:02:28.231 --> 00:02:31.147
that idea here.
It is something,

00:02:31.147 --> 00:02:35.051
as he stresses,
that can be evoked by symbols,

00:02:35.051 --> 00:02:39.042
by poetic symbols,
and this he intends to do in

00:02:39.042 --> 00:02:43.740
his poetry.
In fact, Yeats sees his poems

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:50.248
as a kind of summoning of
spirits or evocation of spirits,

00:02:50.248 --> 00:02:52.759
as he refers to it.
 

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:57.267
Last time I talked just briefly
about Yeats's interest in

00:02:57.267 --> 00:03:01.051
automatic writing,
a practice that he engaged in

00:03:01.051 --> 00:03:06.134
with his wife.
Well, his poems themselves have

00:03:06.134 --> 00:03:12.583
an occult dimension of evoking
this "great mind" and the

00:03:12.583 --> 00:03:17.860
spirits contained therein
through symbols.

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.724
He also stresses that the
borders of our minds,

00:03:21.724 --> 00:03:26.849
and of individual identity,
are ever shifting and unstable,

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:31.856
and that, well,
behind all these ideas,

00:03:31.856 --> 00:03:40.024
I think, is a sense of the poet
as a figure who channels in his

00:03:40.024 --> 00:03:44.308
life,
as well as in his writing,

00:03:44.308 --> 00:03:51.099
channels spirits and presences,
and voices, importantly.

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:56.341
And this is related to Yeats's
idea that the poet – and this

00:03:56.341 --> 00:04:01.410
is something he wrote about in
the prose I asked you to read

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:06.050
for today – that the poet is
more type than man.

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:08.943
On page 884,
late in his life,

00:04:08.943 --> 00:04:14.132
writing a kind of summary
comment on his work for the

00:04:14.132 --> 00:04:19.519
collected edition being produced
by the publisher,

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:24.296
Scribner's, he writes certain
important summary propositions

00:04:24.296 --> 00:04:27.940
about his work but about poetry
in general.

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.349
And he says on page 884:
A poet writes always of

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:34.459
his personal life,
in his finest work out of its

00:04:34.459 --> 00:04:37.901
tragedies, whatever it be,
remorse, lost love or mere

00:04:37.901 --> 00:04:40.978
loneliness;
he never speaks directly as to

00:04:40.978 --> 00:04:44.208
someone at the breakfast table,
there is always a

00:04:44.208 --> 00:04:46.769
phantasmagoria.
Dante and Milton had

00:04:46.769 --> 00:04:50.681
mythologies, Shakespeare the
characters of English history,

00:04:50.681 --> 00:04:53.379
of traditional romance… [and
so on.

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:58.818
He says, the writer]
…is more type than man,

00:04:58.818 --> 00:05:01.839
more passion than type.
 

00:05:01.839 --> 00:05:05.029
He is Lear, Romeo,
Oedipus, Tiresias;

00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:09.181
he has stepped out of a play
and even the woman he loves is

00:05:09.181 --> 00:05:12.259
Rosalind, Cleopatra,
never The Dark Lady.

00:05:12.259 --> 00:05:15.115
[Well.]
He is part of his own

00:05:15.115 --> 00:05:20.726
phantasmagoria and we adore him
because nature has grown

00:05:20.726 --> 00:05:24.113
intelligible,
and by doing so [we apprehend]

00:05:24.113 --> 00:05:25.712
a part of our creative power.
 

00:05:25.712 --> 00:05:28.800
[From A General Introduction
for My Work]

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.779
In the poet and in his work
nature grows intelligible.

00:05:32.779 --> 00:05:39.215
This is an important idea for
Yeats and it suggests that

00:05:39.215 --> 00:05:44.129
though work is rooted in life
for Yeats,

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:48.948
it's always a life transformed,
fed through this

00:05:48.948 --> 00:05:53.050
"phantasmagoria" that he's
discussing,

00:05:53.050 --> 00:06:00.153
which is important because at
once Yeats is insisting on the

00:06:00.153 --> 00:06:07.860
personal nature of his poetry
and of the experience it offers,

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:11.312
and yet he's also,
interestingly,

00:06:11.312 --> 00:06:16.600
a curiously impersonal figure,
impersonal poet.

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:22.760
On page 887 he says,
towards the top of the page:

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:27.069
 
 

00:06:27.069 --> 00:06:34.154
Talk to me of originality
and I will turn on you with

00:06:34.154 --> 00:06:36.247
rage.
I am a crowd,

00:06:36.247 --> 00:06:39.390
I am a lonely man,
I am nothing.

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:43.110
Ancient salt is best packing.
 

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:46.115
The heroes of Shakespeare
convey to us through their

00:06:46.115 --> 00:06:49.121
looks, or through the
metaphorical patterns of their

00:06:49.121 --> 00:06:51.299
speech,
the sudden enlargement of their

00:06:51.299 --> 00:06:54.061
vision, their ecstasy of the
approach of death… [And so

00:06:54.061 --> 00:06:55.788
on.]
[From A General Introduction

00:06:55.788 --> 00:07:00.073
for My Work]
And this is the kind of

00:07:00.073 --> 00:07:07.905
impersonal channeling of emotion
that Yeats, himself a kind of

00:07:07.905 --> 00:07:13.170
actor in his poetry,
wishes to convey.

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:18.627
On your handout there's another
quotation from late in Yeats's

00:07:18.627 --> 00:07:21.670
life that I wanted to emphasize.
 

00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:26.518
He says--and here's that
Yeatsian word "all" again--he

00:07:26.518 --> 00:07:29.559
says:
When I try to put all

00:07:29.559 --> 00:07:33.664
into a phrase I say,
"Man can embody truth but he

00:07:33.664 --> 00:07:37.578
cannot know it."
[Man can embody truth but he

00:07:37.578 --> 00:07:40.846
cannot know it.]
"I must embody it in the

00:07:40.846 --> 00:07:42.889
completion of my life.
 

00:07:42.889 --> 00:07:46.318
The abstract is not life and
everywhere draws out its

00:07:46.318 --> 00:07:48.774
contradictions.
You can refute Hegel but not

00:07:48.774 --> 00:07:50.443
the Saint or the Song of
Experience.

00:07:50.443 --> 00:07:52.780
[From a letter to Lady
Elizabeth Pelham]

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:55.629
That's a wonderful claim.
 

00:07:55.629 --> 00:08:00.392
"You can refute Hegel but not
the Saint or the Song of

00:08:00.392 --> 00:08:05.578
Experience."
"Man can embody truth but

00:08:05.578 --> 00:08:10.346
cannot know it."
This is an important

00:08:10.346 --> 00:08:13.770
formulation.
I think of it as a kind of

00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:18.050
reply to that famous question in
"Leda and the Swan";

00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:22.769
that is, "did she put on his
knowledge with his power /

00:08:22.769 --> 00:08:27.139
before the indifferent beak
could let her drop?"

00:08:27.139 --> 00:08:33.566
The answer that Yeats is giving
here is different from saying

00:08:33.566 --> 00:08:37.850
either "yes" or "no" to that
question.

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:41.820
It's more like saying "yes and
no," I think.

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:46.848
Truth is something to be
embodied in Yeats,

00:08:46.848 --> 00:08:53.353
embodied rather than known;
embodied in the sense of lived,

00:08:53.353 --> 00:08:57.169
not merely understood but
experienced.

00:08:57.169 --> 00:09:00.073
But also, I think,
embodied because it is

00:09:00.073 --> 00:09:04.502
specifically a thing of the body
and involves an experience of

00:09:04.502 --> 00:09:06.971
the body, as much as,
or more than,

00:09:06.971 --> 00:09:10.179
the mind.
What kind of knowledge,

00:09:10.179 --> 00:09:14.972
if any, can be had from the
shattering experiences of

00:09:14.972 --> 00:09:19.488
revolution or rape,
those models of history that I

00:09:19.488 --> 00:09:21.700
proposed last time?
 

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:28.233
Remember how Yeats represents
history as rape in "Leda and the

00:09:28.233 --> 00:09:31.201
Swan."
He sees it there as an

00:09:31.201 --> 00:09:35.232
experience of violence,
of sexual violence,

00:09:35.232 --> 00:09:40.799
involving the intercourse of
opposites: of god and man,

00:09:40.799 --> 00:09:43.923
eternity and time,
male and female,

00:09:43.923 --> 00:09:49.161
the will and patterning force
of the one thing against the

00:09:49.161 --> 00:09:53.019
other,
imposed on it by brute force.

00:09:53.019 --> 00:09:58.440
What kind of knowledge can be
had from that experience?

00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:03.662
"Leda and the Swan" seems to
say a knowledge of the body,

00:10:03.662 --> 00:10:06.740
of the necessity of embodiment.
 

00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:10.982
In the late Yeats,
in the poems that I'll be

00:10:10.982 --> 00:10:15.717
discussing today,
there's no knowledge apart from

00:10:15.717 --> 00:10:20.340
the body.
And this is something to

00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:27.437
contrast with the early Yeats
and its high idealism,

00:10:27.437 --> 00:10:35.370
and its drive to exist in an
abstract and ideal world.

00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:42.901
Late Yeats: this is a poetry
written in age and written about

00:10:42.901 --> 00:10:48.639
age and aging;
age seen and experienced as the

00:10:48.639 --> 00:10:55.257
failure and corruption of the
body, to which the soul is

00:10:55.257 --> 00:10:59.985
bound.
In "Sailing to Byzantium," a

00:10:59.985 --> 00:11:07.537
transitional poem to later
Yeats, on page 123 in your book,

00:11:07.537 --> 00:11:11.498
Yeats says:
An aged man is but a

00:11:11.498 --> 00:11:16.245
paltry thing,
A tattered coat upon a stick,

00:11:16.245 --> 00:11:21.583
unless
Soul clap its hands and sing,

00:11:21.583 --> 00:11:26.573
and louder sing
For every tatter in its mortal

00:11:26.573 --> 00:11:31.627
dress…
The poet speaks of his soul

00:11:31.627 --> 00:11:40.044
there as "sick with desire / and
fastened to a dying animal";

00:11:40.044 --> 00:11:42.990
that is, the body.
 

00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:47.680
And yet, for all of the
complaints about the body here

00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:52.990
in this poem and in other late
Yeats, the poet doesn't reject

00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:56.477
it;
doesn't reject that dying

00:11:56.477 --> 00:11:59.460
animal, doesn't scorn it.
 

00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:04.541
Instead, Yeats affirms it,
affirms the body,

00:12:04.541 --> 00:12:07.259
in its corrupt state.
 

00:12:07.259 --> 00:12:11.991
He, in fact,
sings and sings louder for it

00:12:11.991 --> 00:12:15.690
in this late poetry;
sings louder,

00:12:15.690 --> 00:12:19.707
as he puts it,
"for every tatter in its mortal

00:12:19.707 --> 00:12:23.426
dress."
This is the extraordinary

00:12:23.426 --> 00:12:30.209
energy of Yeats's late poetry,
what he calls--The word he has

00:12:30.209 --> 00:12:36.851
for the energy of this poetry,
of this attitude towards life

00:12:36.851 --> 00:12:42.976
is "joy" or "gaiety," words that
recur throughout these poems:

00:12:42.976 --> 00:12:45.773
"joy,"
"gaiety," or sometimes

00:12:45.773 --> 00:12:49.892
"madness."
Joy and gaiety are both states

00:12:49.892 --> 00:12:56.238
of mind associated with madness
in these poems – the body's

00:12:56.238 --> 00:13:00.072
truth,
felt as an experience of joy or

00:13:00.072 --> 00:13:05.929
of gaiety as arrived at through
a kind of shattering of the body

00:13:05.929 --> 00:13:10.019
and of the rational mind and its
working.

00:13:10.019 --> 00:13:17.547
Gaiety for Yeats seems to
represent some reconstitution of

00:13:17.547 --> 00:13:23.357
mind and body,
some experience of their unity

00:13:23.357 --> 00:13:29.960
out beyond an experience of
tragedy and grief.

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:33.905
This is a point of view
specifically associated in

00:13:33.905 --> 00:13:39.299
Yeats's late poetry with old men
and with women – particularly,

00:13:39.299 --> 00:13:42.421
but not only,
old women, as he says on page

00:13:42.421 --> 00:13:46.880
886, back in that General
Introduction for My Work.

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:50.029
 
 

00:13:50.029 --> 00:13:51.689
This is interesting.
 

00:13:51.689 --> 00:13:56.086
He's talking here about the
kind of style he wishes to

00:13:56.086 --> 00:14:02.273
create in poetry which involves,
for him, making the language of

00:14:02.273 --> 00:14:08.100
poetry coincide with that of
passionate normal speech.

00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:12.066
He says: I wanted to
write [a version of Frost's

00:14:12.066 --> 00:14:14.910
ambition, though conducted
differently]

00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:19.850
in whatever language comes most
naturally when we soliloquise,

00:14:19.850 --> 00:14:22.569
as I do all day long,
upon the events of our own

00:14:22.569 --> 00:14:25.693
lives or of any life where we
can see ourselves for the

00:14:25.693 --> 00:14:29.558
moment.
I sometimes compare myself with

00:14:29.558 --> 00:14:35.600
the mad old slum women I hear
denouncing and remembering;

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:38.527
"how dare you?"
I heard one of them say to an

00:14:38.527 --> 00:14:41.037
imaginary suitor,
"and you without health or a

00:14:41.037 --> 00:14:44.203
home."
If I spoke my thoughts aloud

00:14:44.203 --> 00:14:48.200
they might be as angry and as
wild.

00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:55.949
So this is a kind of model for
the late Yeats in poetry,

00:14:55.949 --> 00:15:02.289
the voice of the angry and wild
slum woman.

00:15:02.289 --> 00:15:10.665
Well, in order to get at this
style in action in Yeats's late

00:15:10.665 --> 00:15:18.900
poems, I want to look back a
little bit at a poem that looks

00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:24.902
back on "Easter,
1916," the poem I discussed

00:15:24.902 --> 00:15:32.580
last time, as well as Yeats's
own earlier poetry,

00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:37.360
and that is the poem called "In
Memory of Eva Gore-Booth and Con

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:39.409
Markievicz," on page 126.
 

00:15:39.409 --> 00:15:46.480
It's a kind of postscript to
"Easter, 1916," written in 1929.

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:51.375
Con Markievicz was the only
surviving leader of the Easter

00:15:51.375 --> 00:15:55.841
Rising, condemned to death,
but then her sentence was

00:15:55.841 --> 00:15:59.070
transmuted.
What is it?

00:15:59.070 --> 00:16:04.809
Yes, thank you:
commuted, not transmuted.

00:16:04.809 --> 00:16:11.620
Well, Con Markievicz is,
in a sense, a figure like Leda.

00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:17.174
She is someone who has suffered
the traumatic violence that

00:16:17.174 --> 00:16:19.090
engenders history.
 

00:16:19.090 --> 00:16:25.160
Yeats's elegy here recalls her
youth and that of her sister,

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:30.509
both friends of the younger
Yeats: Eva Gore-Booth;

00:16:30.509 --> 00:16:34.740
a youth spent in the Sligo
mansion, Lissadell,

00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:37.559
where Yeats visited in 1894.
 

00:16:37.559 --> 00:16:42.884
At that point Yeats was--1894,
Yeats is twenty-nine,

00:16:42.884 --> 00:16:47.270
and the two women were slightly
younger.

00:16:47.270 --> 00:16:49.889
Let me read the beginning of it.
 

00:16:49.889 --> 00:16:52.960
The light of evening,
Lissadell,

00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:59.290
Great windows open to the south,
Two girls in silk kimonos, both

00:16:59.290 --> 00:17:02.940
Beautiful, one a gazelle.
 

00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:07.297
But a raving autumn shears
Blossom from the summer's

00:17:07.297 --> 00:17:10.310
wreath;
The older is condemned to death,

00:17:10.310 --> 00:17:15.730
Pardoned, drags out lonely years
Conspiring among the ignorant.

00:17:15.730 --> 00:17:18.430
I know not what the younger
dreams--

00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:21.920
Some vague Utopia--and she
seems,

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:26.270
When withered old and
skeleton-gaunt,

00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:28.680
An image of such politics.
 

00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:34.230
Many a time I think to seek
One or the other out and speak

00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:37.740
Of that old Georgian mansion,
mix

00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:41.972
Pictures of the mind, recall
That table and the talk of

00:17:41.972 --> 00:17:45.960
youth,
Two girls in silk kimonos, both

00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:52.155
Beautiful, one a gazelle.
Here, female beauty,

00:17:52.155 --> 00:17:57.396
nineteenth-century manners,
and aristocratic culture are

00:17:57.396 --> 00:18:01.970
all held together as if
expressing each other and

00:18:01.970 --> 00:18:05.019
associated with each other.
 

00:18:05.019 --> 00:18:11.331
Yeats's nostalgic vision of
them is charmed and static,

00:18:11.331 --> 00:18:14.019
interestingly static.
 

00:18:14.019 --> 00:18:20.733
See how the verb is withheld in
the first sentence of the poem,

00:18:20.733 --> 00:18:26.579
and then in the closing lines
of that first strophe?

00:18:26.579 --> 00:18:31.092
Well, in order to give us that
image, "two girls in silk

00:18:31.092 --> 00:18:35.703
kimonos, both / beautiful,
one a gazelle," which he

00:18:35.703 --> 00:18:40.523
returns to, it's as if the
action itself were being

00:18:40.523 --> 00:18:46.306
withheld from this charmed world
and time slowed down or even

00:18:46.306 --> 00:18:50.006
stopped,
making a picture,

00:18:50.006 --> 00:18:52.740
an image, a haiku.
 

00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:57.551
But all of this is overthrown,
"changed utterly," by the

00:18:57.551 --> 00:19:03.150
radical politics that altered
Ireland during Yeats's lifetime,

00:19:03.150 --> 00:19:07.812
that announced the coming of
modernity and that these two

00:19:07.812 --> 00:19:11.559
women themselves participated in
centrally.

00:19:11.559 --> 00:19:14.720
Politics makes them ugly to
Yeats.

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:18.661
It's as if they might have
maintained their beauty had they

00:19:18.661 --> 00:19:20.359
only refrained from it.
 

00:19:20.359 --> 00:19:24.688
You could look at a similar
attitude in "A Prayer for My

00:19:24.688 --> 00:19:29.095
Daughter," another important big
Yeats poem from slightly

00:19:29.095 --> 00:19:31.143
earlier,
where Yeats says,

00:19:31.143 --> 00:19:35.168
"An intellectual hatred is the
worst, so let her think" – his

00:19:35.168 --> 00:19:38.090
daughter – "that opinions are
accursed."

00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:40.349
Women shouldn't have them.
 

00:19:40.349 --> 00:19:46.236
This is not an attractive side
of Yeats, at least for people of

00:19:46.236 --> 00:19:48.990
our moment and sensibility.
 

00:19:48.990 --> 00:19:53.704
There's a kind of,
well, masculinism in Yeats,

00:19:53.704 --> 00:19:59.362
and it's part of what I meant
last time when I spoke of

00:19:59.362 --> 00:20:05.230
Yeats's anti-modernism or his
reactionary modernism.

00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:08.509
And it's here,
too, in this poem.

00:20:08.509 --> 00:20:11.541
But the attitude here,
as in "Easter,

00:20:11.541 --> 00:20:16.089
1916" and Yeats's other great
poems, is complicated.

00:20:16.089 --> 00:20:21.910
For all of Yeats's reactionary
moods, even for his indulgence

00:20:21.910 --> 00:20:26.470
in nostalgia here,
he's not a nostalgic poet.

00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:31.289
And this poem I think shows us
what I mean by that.

00:20:31.289 --> 00:20:36.511
Look at how the poem changes as
it develops, as it moves to this

00:20:36.511 --> 00:20:40.499
second strophe,
and Yeats turns from the frozen

00:20:40.499 --> 00:20:45.074
image of the past to address
those two sisters directly,

00:20:45.074 --> 00:20:47.681
saying:
Dear shadows,

00:20:47.681 --> 00:20:51.920
now you know it all,
All the folly of a fight

00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:54.470
With a common wrong or right.
 

00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:58.810
The innocent and the beautiful
Have no enemy but time;

00:20:58.810 --> 00:21:06.071
Arise and bid me strike a match
And strike another till time

00:21:06.071 --> 00:21:09.200
catch;
Should the conflagration climb,

00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:11.520
Run till all the sages know.
 

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:15.740
We the great gazebo built.
 

00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:21.187
They convicted us of guilt;
Bid me strike a match and

00:21:21.187 --> 00:21:26.154
blow.
The poet and the women together

00:21:26.154 --> 00:21:30.789
become "we" in the poem's last
sentence.

00:21:30.789 --> 00:21:34.570
"They," the "they who convicted
us of guilt," well,

00:21:34.570 --> 00:21:36.385
that's hard to identify.
 

00:21:36.385 --> 00:21:39.426
Who is that?
I think it's possible to see

00:21:39.426 --> 00:21:43.240
that "they" as the sort of
general forces of modernity,

00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:48.163
of everything at odds with the
aristocratic culture Yeats and

00:21:48.163 --> 00:21:50.790
these women shared,
inhabited.

00:21:50.790 --> 00:21:54.680
"We the great gazebo built."
 

00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:58.520
I stumbled and put "built" in
the wrong place when I read it.

00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:01.160
It's a strange line.
 

00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:08.391
I am told that it plays on a
slang phrase then current,

00:22:08.391 --> 00:22:14.450
"to make a gazebo of yourself,"
meaning "to make a spectacle of

00:22:14.450 --> 00:22:16.779
yourself and a fool of yourself,
publicly."

00:22:16.779 --> 00:22:21.976
The footnote to your
Norton here suggests that

00:22:21.976 --> 00:22:28.072
the gazebo is a summerhouse and
by extension – it's quite an

00:22:28.072 --> 00:22:32.369
extension – the nationalist
movement,

00:22:32.369 --> 00:22:36.579
and then, "even the whole
temporal world."

00:22:36.579 --> 00:22:39.309
Those are some real extensions,
aren't they?

00:22:39.309 --> 00:22:43.569
It's a little hard to know what
to do with this gazebo.

00:22:43.569 --> 00:22:48.328
Does it, in fact,
represent the nationalist

00:22:48.328 --> 00:22:53.427
movement that culminated,
or one form of which

00:22:53.427 --> 00:22:57.960
culminated, in the Easter
Rebellion?

00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:04.657
Does it represent Yeats's own
early cultural nationalism and

00:23:04.657 --> 00:23:11.242
the work represented in The
Wind Among the Reeds and

00:23:11.242 --> 00:23:13.740
other early poems?
 

00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:15.500
Well, it's a little hard to say.
 

00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:21.643
I tend to see that gazebo or
summerhouse as a version of

00:23:21.643 --> 00:23:26.894
Lissadell itself,
this home that the poem evokes

00:23:26.894 --> 00:23:34.490
and that is representative of a
nineteenth-century world of art,

00:23:34.490 --> 00:23:39.206
of pleasure,
of rarified and delicate and

00:23:39.206 --> 00:23:45.220
ideal beauty – a world very
important to Yeats.

00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:51.990
As Yeats--as his thought
develops in the course of this

00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:59.638
poem, he turns from nostalgia to
affirmation and seems to join

00:23:59.638 --> 00:24:07.412
the sisters in the actions that
they chose through some kind of

00:24:07.412 --> 00:24:13.886
sympathetic identification;
Yeats who had seemed to stand

00:24:13.886 --> 00:24:16.061
apart from it,
against them,

00:24:16.061 --> 00:24:18.720
in the first part of the poem.
 

00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:26.071
The women represent for Yeats a
kind of self-destructive energy,

00:24:26.071 --> 00:24:32.372
and it's something he too,
I think, is willing to share

00:24:32.372 --> 00:24:36.249
and enter into.
He speaks of the destruction of

00:24:36.249 --> 00:24:39.460
the world that they shared,
of a house that they had built,

00:24:39.460 --> 00:24:45.106
one that he mocks as this
"great gazebo," as something

00:24:45.106 --> 00:24:50.211
noble and beautiful,
perhaps, but also fragile and a

00:24:50.211 --> 00:24:54.220
spectacle and unable to stand up
to history.

00:24:54.220 --> 00:24:59.732
Time is the enemy in the poem,
and Yeats joins forces with the

00:24:59.732 --> 00:25:04.445
women at the end,
and in doing so joins forces

00:25:04.445 --> 00:25:10.330
with time and sets a match to
it, as if time itself were

00:25:10.330 --> 00:25:11.400
tinder.
 

00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:14.880
 
 

00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:20.009
Yeats imagines a kind of active
arson in this poem.

00:25:20.009 --> 00:25:25.609
Fire is symbolically important
throughout his poetry.

00:25:25.609 --> 00:25:30.858
In "The Song of the Wandering
Aengus," I talked about the kind

00:25:30.858 --> 00:25:35.676
of flickering passion and the
fire in the head that sends

00:25:35.676 --> 00:25:38.000
Angus out on his quest.
 

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:44.329
Fire reappears with increasing
frequency in the late poetry.

00:25:44.329 --> 00:25:49.089
In your RIS packet,
I gave you the short poem "Two

00:25:49.089 --> 00:25:51.130
Songs from a Play."
 

00:25:51.130 --> 00:25:55.943
The first stanza of that
interesting poem repeats themes

00:25:55.943 --> 00:25:59.619
from "The Magi" and "The Second
Coming."

00:25:59.619 --> 00:26:04.317
You can look at it with those
poems in mind where Yeats

00:26:04.317 --> 00:26:09.623
imagines a new world coming into
being, ushered in through the

00:26:09.623 --> 00:26:11.450
blood of the old.
 

00:26:11.450 --> 00:26:18.693
This idea leads him to the
meditation that's in the second

00:26:18.693 --> 00:26:22.766
stanza there.
Everything that man

00:26:22.766 --> 00:26:26.589
esteems
Endures a moment or a day.

00:26:26.589 --> 00:26:31.779
Love's pleasure drives his love
away,

00:26:31.779 --> 00:26:35.059
The painter's brush consumes
his dreams;

00:26:35.059 --> 00:26:38.340
The herald's cry,
the soldier's tread

00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:44.240
Exhaust his glory and his might:
Whatever flames upon the night

00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:49.289
Man's own resinous heart has
fed.

00:26:49.289 --> 00:26:52.980
"Man's heart" in Yeats is
"resinous";

00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:56.720
it's a sticky filth that flames.
 

00:26:56.720 --> 00:27:02.716
The longing heart accumulates
desires that become in time a

00:27:02.716 --> 00:27:07.990
kind of volatile waste,
which can't be contained.

00:27:07.990 --> 00:27:12.969
The heart is combustible,
like the energy that insists on

00:27:12.969 --> 00:27:16.970
birth in "The Magi" or "The
Second Coming."

00:27:16.970 --> 00:27:20.759
And this is our glory,
Yeats says.

00:27:20.759 --> 00:27:25.851
Again, notice how bodily,
how material and physical

00:27:25.851 --> 00:27:29.619
Yeats's images of human energy
are.

00:27:29.619 --> 00:27:36.304
Let's turn back to The
Norton Anthology and look at

00:27:36.304 --> 00:27:40.759
the poem "Vacillation," on page
131.

00:27:40.759 --> 00:27:45.720
This is a meditation that comes
in several parts.

00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:53.427
As Yeats's work develops,
he creates a kind of poem that

00:27:53.427 --> 00:27:58.737
comes in parts;
that is, you might think of it

00:27:58.737 --> 00:28:04.690
as a kind of sequence poem in
which, with increasing daring,

00:28:04.690 --> 00:28:11.451
Yeats explores contending
viewpoints seeking some kind of

00:28:11.451 --> 00:28:14.490
synthesis.
That's what's going on here.

00:28:14.490 --> 00:28:19.731
There's a similar kind of
structure in other late Yeats's

00:28:19.731 --> 00:28:23.703
poems.
Yeats at first thought to call

00:28:23.703 --> 00:28:26.390
this poem "What Is Joy?"
 

00:28:26.390 --> 00:28:31.135
It takes up his lifelong quest
to reconcile extremities,

00:28:31.135 --> 00:28:36.502
opposites – in his thought,
in his experience – and to

00:28:36.502 --> 00:28:40.059
achieve some kind of unity of
being.

00:28:40.059 --> 00:28:44.920
What is the goal of "Wandering
Aengus"?

00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:49.780
Between extremities
Man runs his course;

00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:53.680
A brand, or flaming breath,
Comes to destroy

00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:57.270
All those antinomies
Of day and night;

00:28:57.270 --> 00:29:01.770
The body calls it death,
The heart remorse.

00:29:01.770 --> 00:29:08.279
But if these be right
What is joy?

00:29:08.279 --> 00:29:14.367
Here, in the first part of the
poem, Yeats talks about death

00:29:14.367 --> 00:29:19.940
and remorse as the end of all
debate, the last word.

00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:24.437
We're all going to die and
we're all going to regret what

00:29:24.437 --> 00:29:27.934
we did.
But this understanding of the

00:29:27.934 --> 00:29:32.718
end of things is only the
cancellation of all those

00:29:32.718 --> 00:29:37.790
antinomies in a kind of failure
to reconcile them;

00:29:37.790 --> 00:29:39.980
and it doesn't satisfy Yeats.
 

00:29:39.980 --> 00:29:43.665
He's asking,
in effect, "how can we be

00:29:43.665 --> 00:29:50.240
joyful in the face of death and
in the face of certain remorse?"

00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:53.960
Or, "how is it that somehow we
are?"

00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:56.160
He wants to explain this.
 

00:29:56.160 --> 00:30:03.756
He wants to find a way to not
so much redeem as affirm time

00:30:03.756 --> 00:30:11.875
and age and understand them not
simply as a cause of despair or

00:30:11.875 --> 00:30:15.150
as a cause of defeat.
 

00:30:15.150 --> 00:30:19.202
The poem then tries out
different answers,

00:30:19.202 --> 00:30:24.145
answers that alternately
explore transcendental and

00:30:24.145 --> 00:30:26.319
secular solutions.
 

00:30:26.319 --> 00:30:31.599
And the poem vacillates,
as it were, between them.

00:30:31.599 --> 00:30:36.512
In Section III below,
Yeats says, "Get all the gold

00:30:36.512 --> 00:30:39.852
and silver that you
can"--"Provide,

00:30:39.852 --> 00:30:43.799
provide!"
But just as in Frost,

00:30:43.799 --> 00:30:48.250
this strategy isn't going to
work.

00:30:48.250 --> 00:30:52.477
So, therefore,
we must take up,

00:30:52.477 --> 00:30:56.423
he suggests,
an ascetic path,

00:30:56.423 --> 00:31:00.976
engaging only,
as he says, in "those works"

00:31:00.976 --> 00:31:04.001
that are fit "for such men as
come / proud,

00:31:04.001 --> 00:31:06.809
open-eyed and laughing to the
tomb."

00:31:06.809 --> 00:31:12.703
In Section IV then,
the next, on the next page,

00:31:12.703 --> 00:31:17.059
blessing is not,
on the other hand,

00:31:17.059 --> 00:31:20.390
something to work for.
 

00:31:20.390 --> 00:31:26.311
Rather, it's a potential fire
that flashes up momentarily

00:31:26.311 --> 00:31:29.808
within us.
My fiftieth year had come

00:31:29.808 --> 00:31:32.900
and gone [when I first read this
poem that

00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:41.848
seemed a really long way in my
future, as perhaps it does to

00:31:41.848 --> 00:31:45.640
you],
I sat, a solitary man,

00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:50.240
In a crowded London shop,
An open book and empty cup

00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:52.740
On the marble table-top.
 

00:31:52.740 --> 00:31:56.270
While on the shop and street I
gazed

00:31:56.270 --> 00:32:02.450
My body of a sudden blazed;
And twenty minutes more or less

00:32:02.450 --> 00:32:05.119
It seemed, so great my
happiness,

00:32:05.119 --> 00:32:09.470
That I was blessèd and could
bless."

00:32:09.470 --> 00:32:17.611
It's a serendipitous and
moving, momentary experience

00:32:17.611 --> 00:32:24.211
Yeats describes.
And notice that it's the body

00:32:24.211 --> 00:32:30.210
that blazes: soul and body or
soul and heart.

00:32:30.210 --> 00:32:35.930
These are antinomies that the
poem is exploring.

00:32:35.930 --> 00:32:43.275
Yeats insists that the heart is
an organ of the body,

00:32:43.275 --> 00:32:46.100
and located in it.
 

00:32:46.100 --> 00:32:47.240
This is important.
 

00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:52.292
In the sixth section,
down below, he speaks of "man's

00:32:52.292 --> 00:32:54.430
blood-sodden heart."
 

00:32:54.430 --> 00:32:59.930
This is another turn on that
image of man's "resinous heart."

00:32:59.930 --> 00:33:07.640
In Section VII,
"Soul" and "Heart" argue.

00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:13.590
The vacillation and debate
become quickest here as one

00:33:13.590 --> 00:33:21.000
point of view gets one line and
the other the rhyming next line.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:25.410
 
 

00:33:25.410 --> 00:33:27.839
The Soul.
 

00:33:27.839 --> 00:33:30.700
Seek out reality,
leave things that seem.

00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:32.764
[That's what the Soul instructs
us.

00:33:32.764 --> 00:33:35.319
The Heart responds.]
The Heart.

00:33:35.319 --> 00:33:38.259
What, be a singer born and lack
a theme?

00:33:38.259 --> 00:33:41.591
The Soul.
Isaiah's coal,

00:33:41.591 --> 00:33:44.589
what more can man desire?
 

00:33:44.589 --> 00:33:45.585
The Heart.
 

00:33:45.585 --> 00:33:47.869
Struck dumb in the simplicity
of fire!

00:33:47.869 --> 00:33:50.203
The Soul.
Look on that fire,

00:33:50.203 --> 00:33:51.920
salvation walks within.
 

00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:53.555
The Heart.
 

00:33:53.555 --> 00:33:57.980
What theme had Homer but
original sin?"

00:33:57.980 --> 00:34:04.535
It's a wonderfully compressed
argument in which the Soul and

00:34:04.535 --> 00:34:11.313
the Heart make competing claims
for Christianity and classical

00:34:11.313 --> 00:34:13.980
and literary wisdom.
 

00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:18.845
Yeats counterposes Isaiah's
prophetic coal to the blazing

00:34:18.845 --> 00:34:22.682
body of Section IV,
where fire is spontaneous,

00:34:22.682 --> 00:34:26.320
imminent, something that arises
from the body.

00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:30.867
There then follows in that last
section a kind of comic

00:34:30.867 --> 00:34:35.500
conclusion where the poet
chooses to side with Homer,

00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:41.712
and implicitly with poetry,
against the theologian Von

00:34:41.712 --> 00:34:48.160
Hügel who's a kind of comic
figure at the end there.

00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:52.206
"Vacillation."
The poem was written following

00:34:52.206 --> 00:34:55.500
a series of poems called the
"Crazy Jane" poems,

00:34:55.500 --> 00:34:59.087
written as a kind of summary of
them, a kind of resolution of

00:34:59.087 --> 00:35:01.059
the debates that go on in them.
 

00:35:01.059 --> 00:35:05.846
You have just one of them in
your Anthology,

00:35:05.846 --> 00:35:08.910
but it is one of the greatest.
 

00:35:08.910 --> 00:35:13.110
It is back on page 130.
 

00:35:13.110 --> 00:35:19.327
In the "Crazy Jane" poems,
the Bishop, who is Crazy Jane's

00:35:19.327 --> 00:35:23.800
antagonist, has the part of Von
Hügel,

00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:30.590
the position of the Church
authority, and Jane speaks for

00:35:30.590 --> 00:35:35.840
Yeats and for poetry;
for Homer, too, I suppose.

00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:40.620
Crazy Jane is one of Yeats's
masks or roles.

00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:43.510
She is a mad peasant woman.
 

00:35:43.510 --> 00:35:49.640
She speaks from the point of
view of a cracked or shattered

00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:54.820
mind, in the tradition of a
Shakespearian fool.

00:35:54.820 --> 00:35:59.553
She speaks what Yeats calls in
his general title for this group

00:35:59.553 --> 00:36:02.760
of poems Words for Music
Perhaps.

00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:09.040
The poem's connection to music
signifies the difference in

00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:14.769
point of view in these poems
from reasoned speech.

00:36:14.769 --> 00:36:21.532
It also seems to relate these
poems to folk forms and to the

00:36:21.532 --> 00:36:23.940
wisdom of the folk.
 

00:36:23.940 --> 00:36:30.760
Jane speaks in praise of love,
in praise of satisfaction.

00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:34.843
She speaks of the necessary
unity of body and soul,

00:36:34.843 --> 00:36:38.599
which for her entails a defense
of the body,

00:36:38.599 --> 00:36:45.970
defending, as she does,
its knowledge and its goodness.

00:36:45.970 --> 00:36:48.510
As a character she is sour.
 

00:36:48.510 --> 00:36:55.890
She's rank, ill-tempered,
pungent in all senses.

00:36:55.890 --> 00:36:59.889
Well, let's look at this debate.
 

00:36:59.889 --> 00:37:01.800
I met the Bishop on the
road

00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:04.579
And much said he and I.
 

00:37:04.579 --> 00:37:07.190
"Those breasts are flat and
fallen now

00:37:07.190 --> 00:37:11.807
Those veins must soon be dry
[this is the Bishop,

00:37:11.807 --> 00:37:17.020
speaking to her of her body];
Live in a heavenly mansion,

00:37:17.020 --> 00:37:20.780
Not in some foul sty."
 

00:37:20.780 --> 00:37:26.680
[To which Jane replies.]
"Fair and foul are near of kin,

00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:30.469
And fair needs foul," I cried.
 

00:37:30.469 --> 00:37:32.760
"My friends are gone,
but that's a truth

00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:37.950
Nor grave nor bed denied,
Learned in bodily lowliness

00:37:37.950 --> 00:37:41.289
And in the heart's pride.
 

00:37:41.289 --> 00:37:47.060
[And she continues.]
"A woman can be proud and stiff

00:37:47.060 --> 00:37:51.224
When on love intent;
But Love has pitched his

00:37:51.224 --> 00:37:54.430
mansion in
The place of excrement;

00:37:54.430 --> 00:37:59.365
For nothing can be sole or whole
That has not been rent."

00:37:59.365 --> 00:38:03.710
["Crazy Jane Talks with the
Bishop"]

00:38:03.710 --> 00:38:08.678
The points of view,
again, are those of the sacred

00:38:08.678 --> 00:38:12.429
and profane, the soul and the
body,

00:38:12.429 --> 00:38:16.836
the promise of a heavenly
mansion, and the reality of a

00:38:16.836 --> 00:38:19.039
life lived in a foul sty.
 

00:38:19.039 --> 00:38:24.650
The Bishop claims one side of
debate, Jane claims the other.

00:38:24.650 --> 00:38:27.567
But unlike the Bishop,
she doesn't want to reject the

00:38:27.567 --> 00:38:29.250
other and this is important.
 

00:38:29.250 --> 00:38:33.496
Speaking for the body,
she speaks for the potential

00:38:33.496 --> 00:38:35.619
unity of body and soul.
 

00:38:35.619 --> 00:38:41.711
In answer to the promise of the
Bishop's heavenly mansion in

00:38:41.711 --> 00:38:45.737
another life,
she claims another sort of

00:38:45.737 --> 00:38:48.523
house,
what she calls love's

00:38:48.523 --> 00:38:53.868
"mansion," which is noble itself
and which is to be lived here on

00:38:53.868 --> 00:38:57.495
earth.
"Love has pitched his mansion

00:38:57.495 --> 00:39:00.470
in / the place of excrement."
 

00:39:00.470 --> 00:39:02.490
This is an outrageous claim.
 

00:39:02.490 --> 00:39:04.309
What does it mean?
 

00:39:04.309 --> 00:39:06.619
Look at the claim it's paired
with.

00:39:06.619 --> 00:39:13.000
"For nothing can be sole or
whole / that has not been rent."

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:18.713
Why is it necessary to rend
something, to make it soul or

00:39:18.713 --> 00:39:21.739
whole?
Is it necessary?

00:39:21.739 --> 00:39:28.371
Only that which is broken,
Jane claims,

00:39:28.371 --> 00:39:35.320
is unified.
That which appears whole is not.

00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:40.938
Yeats seems to be insisting
through Jane on the necessity of

00:39:40.938 --> 00:39:45.699
shattering experience to achieve
unity of being,

00:39:45.699 --> 00:39:50.234
which Yeats imagines,
again, as the union of

00:39:50.234 --> 00:39:54.011
opposites.
Again, think of the rape of

00:39:54.011 --> 00:39:57.490
Leda.
This is the type of the violent

00:39:57.490 --> 00:40:02.672
union that Yeats imagines in
which the divine enters the

00:40:02.672 --> 00:40:06.381
human,
and the human finds access to

00:40:06.381 --> 00:40:09.539
the divine through the bestial.
 

00:40:09.539 --> 00:40:13.775
And the bestial is identified
in Yeats with the heart and with

00:40:13.775 --> 00:40:16.900
the irrational and with the
uncontrollable.

00:40:16.900 --> 00:40:20.969
 
 

00:40:20.969 --> 00:40:29.884
Yeats's late poems speak from
the point of view of Jane,

00:40:29.884 --> 00:40:35.126
more often than not,
and yet powerfully,

00:40:35.126 --> 00:40:40.242
we do see him vacillating from
different--between different

00:40:40.242 --> 00:40:44.963
points of view.
We have really no time left to

00:40:44.963 --> 00:40:49.560
explore them,
but I want to just point you to

00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:55.410
two important late poems that
seem to represent different

00:40:55.410 --> 00:41:01.510
attitudes in late Yeats,
that contrast the kinds of

00:41:01.510 --> 00:41:05.289
claim that can be made for art.
 

00:41:05.289 --> 00:41:11.848
One of them is the moving
valedictory to his work that is

00:41:11.848 --> 00:41:16.650
called "The Circus Animals'
Desertion,"

00:41:16.650 --> 00:41:24.999
where the poet imagines his
imagination as having arisen on

00:41:24.999 --> 00:41:31.733
ladders, if you will,
out of what he calls "the foul

00:41:31.733 --> 00:41:35.500
rag and bone shop of the heart."
 

00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:43.043
And in conclusion he imagines
giving up that terrific drive

00:41:43.043 --> 00:41:50.197
towards imagination and
idealization and a return to the

00:41:50.197 --> 00:41:55.010
"rag and bone shop of the
heart."

00:41:55.010 --> 00:42:01.405
That's an image of art
ultimately leading out of art to

00:42:01.405 --> 00:42:05.670
a kind of state of
de-sublimation.

00:42:05.670 --> 00:42:13.748
Contrast this poem to "Lapis
Lazuli," a beautiful and moving

00:42:13.748 --> 00:42:22.101
late poem on page 135 that is
full of echoes from that general

00:42:22.101 --> 00:42:29.769
introduction to his work that I
quoted from earlier.

00:42:29.769 --> 00:42:38.255
Here, Yeats presents us with an
image of art in the form of a

00:42:38.255 --> 00:42:46.287
lapis lazuli Chinese carving,
and he describes the figures on

00:42:46.287 --> 00:42:50.288
that carving,
who are in some sense

00:42:50.288 --> 00:42:56.940
representatives of an attitude,
again, beyond tragedy,

00:42:56.940 --> 00:43:04.289
beyond the kinds of social and
political apocalypse that Yeats

00:43:04.289 --> 00:43:11.880
faced in his career and that he
describes also in this poem.

00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:16.992
And Yeats concludes,
well, with an image of the

00:43:16.992 --> 00:43:24.079
artwork that I'll read for you,
that is fascinating in itself

00:43:24.079 --> 00:43:30.684
but is also, as I suggest,
an image of Yeats's late ideal

00:43:30.684 --> 00:43:34.340
for what art should be like.
 

00:43:34.340 --> 00:43:37.171
He says:
Every discolouration of

00:43:37.171 --> 00:43:43.570
the stone [this is on page 136],
Every accidental crack or dent

00:43:43.570 --> 00:43:46.940
Seems a water-course or an
avalanche,

00:43:46.940 --> 00:43:50.599
Or lofty slope where it still
snows

00:43:50.599 --> 00:43:52.969
Though doubtless plumb or
cherry-branch

00:43:52.969 --> 00:43:55.019
Sweetens the little half-way
house

00:43:55.019 --> 00:43:59.210
Those Chinamen climb towards,
and I

00:43:59.210 --> 00:44:04.796
Delight to imagine them seated
there [at their altitude,

00:44:04.796 --> 00:44:10.789
looking at the world from
within the perspective of art];

00:44:10.789 --> 00:44:14.269
There, on the mountain and the
sky,

00:44:14.269 --> 00:44:17.060
On all the tragic scene they
stare.

00:44:17.060 --> 00:44:22.165
One asks for mournful melodies;
Accomplished fingers begin to

00:44:22.165 --> 00:44:25.063
play.
Their eyes, amid many wrinkles,

00:44:25.063 --> 00:44:27.066
their eyes,
Their ancient,

00:44:27.066 --> 00:44:29.480
glittering eyes,
are gay.

00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:35.848
And there is finally,
again, an affirmation of this

00:44:35.848 --> 00:44:41.579
joy and gaiety,
here seen as a property of the

00:44:41.579 --> 00:44:44.000
artwork itself.

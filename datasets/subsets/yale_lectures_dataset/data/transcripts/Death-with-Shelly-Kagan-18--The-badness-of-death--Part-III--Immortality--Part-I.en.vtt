00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:03.169
Professor Shelly Kagan:
Last time I sketched the

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:06.405
deprivation account.
That's a story or theory about

00:00:06.405 --> 00:00:09.800
what it is about death that
makes it bad.

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.123
What's bad about death is the
fact that, because you're dead,

00:00:13.123 --> 00:00:15.947
because you don't exist,
you're deprived of the good

00:00:15.947 --> 00:00:18.851
things in life.
Being dead isn't intrinsically

00:00:18.851 --> 00:00:20.171
bad.
It's not like it's an

00:00:20.171 --> 00:00:24.490
unpleasant experience.
But it's comparatively bad.

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:27.078
You're worse off by virtue of
the fact that you're not getting

00:00:27.078 --> 00:00:29.370
the things that you would get,
were you still alive.

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:32.380
If I'm dead I can't spend time
with my loved ones.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.500
I can't look at sunsets.
I can't listen to music.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.140
I can't discuss philosophy.
The deprivation account says,

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.676
what's bad about death is the
fact that you're deprived of the

00:00:41.676 --> 00:00:44.687
good things in life.
Now, that seems pretty

00:00:44.687 --> 00:00:47.280
plausible, as a basic story
goes.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.109
But as we also saw last time,
there are some philosophical

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:54.719
puzzles about how it could be.
The question of when is death

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.035
bad for you, and even more
importantly and more

00:00:57.035 --> 00:00:58.922
essentially,
there's the difficulty of

00:00:58.922 --> 00:01:00.826
asking ourselves,
do we really believe it's

00:01:00.826 --> 00:01:02.820
possible for something to be bad
for you,

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.470
when you don't even exist?
We saw a series of difficult

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.618
choices.
If we don't throw in an

00:01:10.618 --> 00:01:13.886
existence requirement,
if we don't say--to put it more

00:01:13.886 --> 00:01:16.952
positively,
if we say things can be bad for

00:01:16.952 --> 00:01:21.145
you even if you don't exist at
all, then we're forced to say

00:01:21.145 --> 00:01:25.244
that things are bad for Larry.
You'll recall that Larry was

00:01:25.244 --> 00:01:29.003
our name for a potential person,
somebody who could have come

00:01:29.003 --> 00:01:32.450
into existence but never
actually does or will come into

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.226
existence.
Well, talk about people who are

00:01:35.226 --> 00:01:38.839
deprived of the good things in
life, Larry's completely

00:01:38.839 --> 00:01:41.150
deprived of the good things in
life.

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.846
If we think it doesn't matter
whether or not you exist,

00:01:43.846 --> 00:01:46.292
for things to be bad for you,
then we have to say,

00:01:46.292 --> 00:01:49.788
"Oh, things are bad for Larry."
And not just Larry,

00:01:49.788 --> 00:01:53.838
but all of the 1.5 million,
billion, billion,

00:01:53.838 --> 00:01:57.060
billion never-to-be-born
people.

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.219
The number of potential people
is just staggering.

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:03.706
And if we throw away an
existence requirement,

00:02:03.706 --> 00:02:06.413
we have to say it's a moral
tragedy of unspeakable

00:02:06.413 --> 00:02:09.120
proportions that these people
are never born,

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.669
that they never come into
existence.

00:02:11.669 --> 00:02:14.810
Now, there are philosophers who
are prepared to say that.

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.922
But if you're not prepared to
say that, it looks as though

00:02:17.922 --> 00:02:21.090
you've got to accept some kind
of existence requirement.

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.920
Why don't we feel sorry for
Larry and his billions upon

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.970
billions of never-to-be-born
compatriots?

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.290
Because, indeed,
they don't exist.

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.814
They're merely possible.
And we might say,

00:02:32.814 --> 00:02:36.039
you've got to exist in order
for something to be bad for you.

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:38.877
But once we say that,
it seems we're running towards

00:02:38.877 --> 00:02:40.770
the position that,
in that case,

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.398
death can't be bad for me,
because of course,

00:02:43.398 --> 00:02:45.250
when I'm dead,
I don't exist.

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:46.750
So how can anything be bad for
me?

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.910
I proposed at the end of class
last time that we could try to

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.168
solve this problem by
distinguishing between two

00:02:54.168 --> 00:02:57.704
versions of the existence
requirement--a more modest

00:02:57.704 --> 00:03:01.769
version and the bolder version.
The bolder version says,

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:05.579
"In order for something to be
bad for you, you've got to exist

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:08.139
at the very time that it's
happening."

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:09.423
If we say that,
then indeed,

00:03:09.423 --> 00:03:11.800
we can say, "It's not bad that
Larry doesn't exist,

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.750
because he doesn't exist
now."

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.373
So there's nothing--even if we
wanted to think that there are

00:03:16.373 --> 00:03:18.997
good things he could be having,
that's not bad for him to not

00:03:18.997 --> 00:03:21.220
have them.
He doesn't exist now.

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.216
But it also,
if we go all the way to the

00:03:23.216 --> 00:03:25.520
bold existence requirement,
we have to say,

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:28.675
"Look, when I'm dead that won't
be bad for me,

00:03:28.675 --> 00:03:31.270
because, well,
I won't exist then."

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:33.857
But instead of accepting the
bold existence requirement,

00:03:33.857 --> 00:03:36.680
we might settle for something a
little bit less demanding,

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.840
the thing I dub "the modest
existence requirement."

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:45.101
In order for something to be
bad for you, there has to have

00:03:45.101 --> 00:03:50.000
been a time, some time or the
other, when you exist.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.068
You've got to,
as it were, exist at least

00:03:52.068 --> 00:03:54.500
briefly in order to get
into the club,

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.707
as we might put it,
of those creatures,

00:03:56.707 --> 00:04:00.194
those possible creatures that
we care about and are concerned

00:04:00.194 --> 00:04:03.302
about morally.
You have to have gotten in the

00:04:03.302 --> 00:04:07.219
club by at least having existed
for some period of time.

00:04:07.219 --> 00:04:11.093
But once you're in the club,
things can be bad for you,

00:04:11.093 --> 00:04:15.539
even if you don't happen to
exist at that particular moment.

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:18.680
If we accept the modest
existence requirement,

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.961
then we can say,
it's not bad that Larry doesn't

00:04:21.961 --> 00:04:24.963
exist, because,
well, Larry doesn't get into

00:04:24.963 --> 00:04:27.170
the club.
In order to get into the club

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:29.569
of things that we feel sorry
for, you have to have existed at

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:32.375
least some moment or the other.
Larry and the billions upon

00:04:32.375 --> 00:04:35.106
billions upon billions of
potential people who never

00:04:35.106 --> 00:04:38.362
actually come into existence,
they don't satisfy the

00:04:38.362 --> 00:04:42.360
requirement of having existed at
some time or the other.

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.540
So we don't have to feel sorry
for them.

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:49.851
But we can feel sorry for
somebody who died last week at

00:04:49.851 --> 00:04:54.872
the age of 10 because we can
say, well, they existed,

00:04:54.872 --> 00:04:58.787
albeit very briefly.
And so they're in the club of

00:04:58.787 --> 00:05:01.376
beings that we can feel sorry
for and say, look,

00:05:01.376 --> 00:05:04.129
it's bad for them that they're
not still alive.

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:06.615
Think of all the good things in
life they would be getting if

00:05:06.615 --> 00:05:09.546
they were still alive.
So the modest existence

00:05:09.546 --> 00:05:13.420
requirement allows us to avoid
both extremes.

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:16.899
Maybe then that's the position
that we should accept.

00:05:16.899 --> 00:05:20.370
It may be, on balance,
the best possible view here.

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:23.634
But I just want to emphasize
that even the modest existence

00:05:23.634 --> 00:05:27.180
requirement is not without its
counterintuitive implications.

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:31.691
Consider somebody's life.
Suppose that somebody's got a

00:05:31.691 --> 00:05:34.831
nice long life.
Comes into existence,

00:05:34.831 --> 00:05:37.942
leads--lives 10,20,
30,40, 50,60,

00:05:37.942 --> 00:05:40.879
70,80, 90 years.
Nice life.

00:05:40.879 --> 00:05:45.680
Now, imagine that we bring it
about that instead of living 90

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:49.440
years, they have a somewhat
shorter life--10,20,

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:53.115
30,40, 50 years.
We've caused them to die after

00:05:53.115 --> 00:05:57.265
50 years as opposed to the 90
years they might have otherwise

00:05:57.265 --> 00:05:59.481
had.
Well, we can say,

00:05:59.481 --> 00:06:05.797
look, that's worse for them--to
live merely 50 years instead of

00:06:05.797 --> 00:06:10.295
the full 90 or 100 years.
And if we accept the modest

00:06:10.295 --> 00:06:12.610
existence requirement,
we can say that,

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:15.742
because after all,
whether you live 50 years or 90

00:06:15.742 --> 00:06:18.610
years, you did exist at some
time or the other.

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:21.289
So the fact that you lost the
40 years you otherwise would

00:06:21.289 --> 00:06:23.170
have gotten, well,
that's bad for you.

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:24.579
There.
Fair enough.

00:06:24.579 --> 00:06:25.460
That gives us the answer we
want.

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:28.956
That's not counterintuitive.
Now, imagine that instead of

00:06:28.956 --> 00:06:31.929
living 50 years,
the person lives only 10,20

00:06:31.929 --> 00:06:34.949
years and then dies.
Well, that's worse still.

00:06:34.949 --> 00:06:38.168
Think of all the extra goods
they would have gotten if only

00:06:38.168 --> 00:06:41.201
they hadn't died then.
And if I caused them to die

00:06:41.201 --> 00:06:45.170
after 20 years instead of 50 or
90 years, I've made things worse

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:48.067
and worse.
Imagine that I caused them to

00:06:48.067 --> 00:06:50.940
die after one year.
Worse still.

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:54.054
All this is perfectly intuitive.
The shorter their life,

00:06:54.054 --> 00:06:57.774
the worse it is for them,
the more they're deprived of

00:06:57.774 --> 00:07:02.290
the good things in life.
So 90-year life, not bad.

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:05.950
50-year life, worse.
10-year life, worse still.

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:10.660
One-year life, worse still.
One-month life, worse still.

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:16.640
One day life, worse still.
One-minute life, worse still.

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:20.516
One-second life, worse still.
Now, imagine that I bring it

00:07:20.516 --> 00:07:23.420
about that the person never
comes into existence at all.

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:25.879
Oh, that's fine.
See?

00:07:25.879 --> 00:07:29.953
That's the implication of
accepting the modest existence

00:07:29.953 --> 00:07:33.304
requirement.
If I shortened the life they

00:07:33.304 --> 00:07:38.430
would have had so completely
that they never get born at all,

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:40.864
or they never come into
existence at all,

00:07:40.864 --> 00:07:44.456
then they don't satisfy the
requirement of having existed at

00:07:44.456 --> 00:07:47.251
some time or the other.
So although we were making

00:07:47.251 --> 00:07:49.775
things worse and worse and worse
and worse and worse as we

00:07:49.775 --> 00:07:52.207
shortened the life,
when we finally snip out that

00:07:52.207 --> 00:07:54.972
last little fraction of a
second, it turns out we didn't

00:07:54.972 --> 00:07:58.769
make things worse at all.
Now we haven't done anything

00:07:58.769 --> 00:08:01.197
objectionable.
That's, it seems,

00:08:01.197 --> 00:08:04.977
what you've got to say if you
accept the modest existence

00:08:04.977 --> 00:08:07.785
requirement.
Of course, if we didn't have an

00:08:07.785 --> 00:08:10.217
existence requirement at all,
we could say,

00:08:10.217 --> 00:08:13.170
"Well look, worst of all,
never to have been born at

00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:15.639
all."
Fair enough.

00:08:15.639 --> 00:08:17.929
But if you say that,
then you've got to feel sorry

00:08:17.929 --> 00:08:20.601
for Larry.
You've got to feel sorry for

00:08:20.601 --> 00:08:23.920
the 1.5 million billion,
billion, billions.

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:28.474
So which view is it that on
balance is the--I don't want to

00:08:28.474 --> 00:08:31.855
say "most plausible."
I think when we start thinking

00:08:31.855 --> 00:08:34.112
about these puzzles,
every alternative seems

00:08:34.112 --> 00:08:37.829
unattractive in its own way.
Maybe the most we could hope

00:08:37.829 --> 00:08:42.083
for is, which is the least
implausible thing to say

00:08:42.083 --> 00:08:46.580
here?
I'm not altogether certain.

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:50.731
Let me turn to one more trouble
or problem or puzzle for the

00:08:50.731 --> 00:08:54.251
deprivation account.
And this particular puzzle

00:08:54.251 --> 00:08:58.649
arises whether or not we accept
an existence requirement,

00:08:58.649 --> 00:09:01.429
whether or not we accept a bold
existence requirement,

00:09:01.429 --> 00:09:04.870
a modest existence requirement,
or no existence requirement,

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:08.412
because we're going to deal
with somebody who actually does

00:09:08.412 --> 00:09:13.679
exist at some time or the other,
namely you or me.

00:09:13.679 --> 00:09:17.139
This is actually a puzzle that
some of you may have written

00:09:17.139 --> 00:09:19.704
your paper on,
because it's the puzzle about

00:09:19.704 --> 00:09:22.603
Lucretius,
the puzzle that Lucretius gives

00:09:22.603 --> 00:09:24.511
us.
It's not a direct quote,

00:09:24.511 --> 00:09:28.545
but Lucretius basically says,
look, most of us are upset and

00:09:28.545 --> 00:09:31.760
anxious at the fact that we're
going to die.

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:35.430
We think death is bad for us.
There'll be this period after

00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:39.776
my death in which I won't exist.
And the deprivation account

00:09:39.776 --> 00:09:43.370
helps say why that's bad,
because during this period of

00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:46.099
nonexistence,
you're not enjoying the good

00:09:46.099 --> 00:09:48.065
things in life.
Fair enough,

00:09:48.065 --> 00:09:49.919
says Lucretius,
but wait a minute.

00:09:49.919 --> 00:09:53.730
The period after you die isn't
the only period during

00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:56.951
which you don't exist.
It's not the only period in

00:09:56.951 --> 00:10:00.231
which if only you were still
alive, you could still be

00:10:00.231 --> 00:10:02.460
enjoying the good things in
life.

00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:05.620
There's another period of
nonexistence.

00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:09.595
It's the period before my birth.
I think I've just switched the

00:10:09.595 --> 00:10:10.769
timeline here,
but all right.

00:10:10.769 --> 00:10:14.750
Imagine this is the period
before my birth.

00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:18.256
Just like there'll be an
infinite period after my death

00:10:18.256 --> 00:10:22.110
in which I won't exist,
and realizing that fills us

00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:26.406
with dismay, there was,
of course, an infinite period

00:10:26.406 --> 00:10:30.897
before I came into existence.
Well, if nonexistence is so bad

00:10:30.897 --> 00:10:34.355
and by the deprivation account
it seems that we want to say

00:10:34.355 --> 00:10:37.758
that it is,
shouldn't I be upset at the

00:10:37.758 --> 00:10:42.799
fact that there was this
eternity before I was born?

00:10:42.799 --> 00:10:44.079
But, says Lucretius,
that's silly,

00:10:44.079 --> 00:10:46.669
right?
Nobody's upset about the fact

00:10:46.669 --> 00:10:50.600
that there was an eternity
before they were born.

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:54.725
In which case,
it doesn't make any sense to be

00:10:54.725 --> 00:10:59.950
upset about the eternity after
you die of nonexistence.

00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:03.840
Well, Lucretius doesn't offer
this as a puzzle.

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:07.830
Lucretius offers this as an
argument that we should not be

00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:11.399
concerned about the fact that
we're going to die.

00:11:11.399 --> 00:11:14.991
Most philosophers aren't
willing to go with Lucretius all

00:11:14.991 --> 00:11:17.750
the way to the end of the bus,
bus route.

00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:22.151
Most philosophers want to say
there's got to be something

00:11:22.151 --> 00:11:25.059
wrong with that argument
someplace.

00:11:25.059 --> 00:11:27.957
There's got to be some-- Well,
what are the possibilities

00:11:27.957 --> 00:11:29.804
here?
One possibility is indeed to

00:11:29.804 --> 00:11:31.289
just agree with him,
right?

00:11:31.289 --> 00:11:35.870
Nothing bad about the eternity
before I was born.

00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:38.580
So, nothing bad--of the
eternity of nonexistence.

00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:42.120
So nothing bad about the
eternity of nonexistence after I

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:44.062
die.
That's one possibility,

00:11:44.062 --> 00:11:47.688
to agree with Lucretius.
Second possibility is to say,

00:11:47.688 --> 00:11:49.750
look, Lucretius,
you're right.

00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:56.005
We really do need to treat
these two eternities of

00:11:56.005 --> 00:12:00.580
nonexistence on a par.
But we could turn it around.

00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:04.471
Instead of saying with
Lucretius, nothing bad about

00:12:04.471 --> 00:12:07.740
this one, so nothing bad about
this one,

00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:11.686
maybe we should say instead,
something bad about the one

00:12:11.686 --> 00:12:14.771
after we die,
and so something bad about the

00:12:14.771 --> 00:12:19.180
one before we were born.
Maybe we should just stick to

00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:23.320
the deprivation account and not
lose faith in it.

00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:27.071
The deprivation account says
it's bad that there's this

00:12:27.071 --> 00:12:30.506
period after we die,
because if only we weren't dead

00:12:30.506 --> 00:12:34.379
then, we would still be able to
enjoy the good things in life.

00:12:34.379 --> 00:12:36.735
Maybe we should say,
look, similarly then,

00:12:36.735 --> 00:12:40.067
when the deprivation account
tells us it's bad that there's

00:12:40.067 --> 00:12:42.710
this period before we come into
existence,

00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:45.814
when we don't exist.
Because if only we had existed

00:12:45.814 --> 00:12:49.389
then, we'd be able to enjoy the
good things in life.

00:12:49.389 --> 00:12:52.981
Maybe Lucretius was right,
we have to treat both periods

00:12:52.981 --> 00:12:55.340
the same.
But he's wrong in thinking we

00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:57.490
shouldn't think either period is
bad.

00:12:57.490 --> 00:13:00.770
Maybe we should think
both periods are bad.

00:13:00.770 --> 00:13:04.351
Well, that's a possibility.
What other possibilities are

00:13:04.351 --> 00:13:06.754
there?
Another possibility is to say,

00:13:06.754 --> 00:13:10.088
Lucretius, you're right,
there are two periods of

00:13:10.088 --> 00:13:13.835
nonexistence,
but there's a justification for

00:13:13.835 --> 00:13:18.974
treating them differently.
They're asymmetrical in a way

00:13:18.974 --> 00:13:24.957
that makes sense from the point
of view of what we should care

00:13:24.957 --> 00:13:27.389
about.
Well, it's easy to say

00:13:27.389 --> 00:13:29.678
that.
The puzzle--most philosophers

00:13:29.678 --> 00:13:33.273
want to take that last way out.
They want to say there's

00:13:33.273 --> 00:13:36.299
something that explains why it
makes sense, why it's

00:13:36.299 --> 00:13:39.253
reasonable,
to care about the eternity of

00:13:39.253 --> 00:13:43.574
nonexistence after my death,
but where that doesn't apply to

00:13:43.574 --> 00:13:47.090
the eternity of nonexistence
before my birth.

00:13:47.090 --> 00:13:51.405
And then the puzzle is to point
to a difference that would

00:13:51.405 --> 00:13:55.948
justify that kind of rationally
asymmetrical treatment of the

00:13:55.948 --> 00:13:58.665
two periods.
It's easy to say it's

00:13:58.665 --> 00:14:01.299
okay, it's reasonable to treat
them differently.

00:14:01.299 --> 00:14:05.338
The philosophical challenge is
to point to something that

00:14:05.338 --> 00:14:10.254
explains or justifies that.
Now, a very common response is

00:14:10.254 --> 00:14:17.154
to say something like this.
Look, consider the period after

00:14:17.154 --> 00:14:20.420
my death.
I'm no longer alive.

00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:25.611
I have lost my life.
In contrast,

00:14:25.611 --> 00:14:29.699
the period before my birth,
although I'm not alive,

00:14:29.699 --> 00:14:34.759
I have not lost my life.
I have never yet been alive.

00:14:34.759 --> 00:14:39.026
And so, of course,
you can't lose something you've

00:14:39.026 --> 00:14:41.728
never yet had.
So what's worse,

00:14:41.728 --> 00:14:45.816
this answer suggests,
about the period after death,

00:14:45.816 --> 00:14:49.659
is the fact that death involves
loss,

00:14:49.659 --> 00:14:55.129
whereas prenatal nonexistence
does not involve loss.

00:14:55.129 --> 00:14:58.427
And so, the conclusion comes,
and now we see why it's okay to

00:14:58.427 --> 00:15:01.615
care more about that one than
this one, the one after death

00:15:01.615 --> 00:15:05.057
and the one before birth.
Because the one after death

00:15:05.057 --> 00:15:08.000
involves loss,
and the one before birth does

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.384
not.
Very, very common response,

00:15:11.384 --> 00:15:17.840
but I'm inclined to think that
can't be an adequate answer.

00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:22.574
It's true, of course,
that this period involves loss,

00:15:22.574 --> 00:15:26.490
because the very definition of
"loss" is,

00:15:26.490 --> 00:15:31.650
you don't have something that
at an earlier time you did have.

00:15:31.650 --> 00:15:35.870
So this period involves loss.
But the period before birth

00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:38.515
does not involve loss,
because although I don't have

00:15:38.515 --> 00:15:40.680
life,
I haven't, previous to the

00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:43.441
period, had life,
so I haven't lost

00:15:43.441 --> 00:15:46.740
anything.
Of course, there's another

00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:50.953
thing that's true about this
prenatal period,

00:15:50.953 --> 00:15:56.700
to wit, I don't have life and
I'm going to get it.

00:15:56.700 --> 00:16:00.473
So I don't yet have something
that's going to come in the

00:16:00.473 --> 00:16:02.946
future.
That's not true about the

00:16:02.946 --> 00:16:05.559
post-life period.
I've lost life.

00:16:05.559 --> 00:16:08.070
But it's not true of this
period that I don't have life

00:16:08.070 --> 00:16:09.929
and I'm going to get it in the
future.

00:16:09.929 --> 00:16:13.600
So this period involves
loss.

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:16.656
Interesting.
In fact, we don't have a name

00:16:16.656 --> 00:16:19.972
for this other state,
where you don't yet have

00:16:19.972 --> 00:16:24.539
something that you'll get later,
but you don't yet have it.

00:16:24.539 --> 00:16:29.048
Let's call that,
not loss, let's call it

00:16:29.048 --> 00:16:33.688
"schmoss," okay?
So during this period,

00:16:33.688 --> 00:16:39.269
there's a loss of life,
but no schmoss of life.

00:16:39.269 --> 00:16:42.927
And in this period,
there's no loss of life,

00:16:42.927 --> 00:16:47.631
but there's a schmoss of life.
And now we need to ask,

00:16:47.631 --> 00:16:51.165
as philosophers,
why do we care more about

00:16:51.165 --> 00:16:55.559
loss of life than
schmoss of life?

00:16:55.559 --> 00:17:01.434
What is it about the fact that
we don't have something that we

00:17:01.434 --> 00:17:07.020
used to, that makes it worse
than not having something that

00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:10.766
we're going to?
It's easy to overlook the

00:17:10.766 --> 00:17:13.910
symmetry here,
because we've got this nice

00:17:13.910 --> 00:17:18.049
word "loss," and we don't have
this word "schmoss."

00:17:18.049 --> 00:17:21.642
But that's not really
explaining anything,

00:17:21.642 --> 00:17:26.549
it's just pointing to the thing
that needs explaining.

00:17:26.549 --> 00:17:34.373
Why do we care more about not
having what once upon a time we

00:17:34.373 --> 00:17:41.936
did, than we care about not
having what once upon a time we

00:17:41.936 --> 00:17:44.332
will?
Well, there's some other

00:17:44.332 --> 00:17:47.355
proposals that we might make.
A couple of them have actually

00:17:47.355 --> 00:17:49.299
been sketched in some of your
reading.

00:17:49.299 --> 00:17:52.436
So for example,
Tom Nagel, in his essay on

00:17:52.436 --> 00:17:55.650
death says, look,
here's the difference.

00:17:55.650 --> 00:18:00.051
It's easy enough to
imagine--and indeed for there to

00:18:00.051 --> 00:18:04.279
actually be a possibility of--my
living longer.

00:18:04.279 --> 00:18:07.350
Suppose I die at the age of 80
and if I didn't die,

00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:10.360
then I'd continue living
90,100, what have you.

00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:13.130
There it is.
It's still me.

00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:17.702
When you imagine me with an
earlier--rather with living

00:18:17.702 --> 00:18:22.019
longer, you're imagining
me living longer.

00:18:22.019 --> 00:18:24.675
To use the vocabulary that we
introduced in thinking about

00:18:24.675 --> 00:18:28.036
some of Plato's arguments,
we might say although --suppose

00:18:28.036 --> 00:18:31.088
I die at age 80--that's a fact
about me, it's a

00:18:31.088 --> 00:18:35.825
contingent fact about me.
It's not a necessary fact about

00:18:35.825 --> 00:18:39.542
me that I died at 80.
Suppose at 80 I get hit by a

00:18:39.542 --> 00:18:41.286
car.
It's not a necessary truth

00:18:41.286 --> 00:18:43.099
about me that I got hit by a
car.

00:18:43.099 --> 00:18:47.746
I could have not gotten hit by
a car, and lived to the ripe old

00:18:47.746 --> 00:18:50.606
age of 90 or 100.
When you die is not an

00:18:50.606 --> 00:18:54.066
essential feature of you,
so it's easy for us to think

00:18:54.066 --> 00:18:57.200
about the possibility in which I
live longer.

00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:00.030
But, says Nagel,
when I try to imagine what

00:19:00.030 --> 00:19:03.737
would the alternative be,
if I'm going to be upset about

00:19:03.737 --> 00:19:08.585
the prenatal nonexistence,
we have to imagine my being

00:19:08.585 --> 00:19:11.470
born earlier.
I was born in 1954.

00:19:11.470 --> 00:19:15.787
Should I be upset about the
fact that I was born in 1954

00:19:15.787 --> 00:19:18.867
instead of 1944?
That's the analog of being

00:19:18.867 --> 00:19:22.009
upset about the fact that I die
in whatever it is,

00:19:22.009 --> 00:19:24.190
2044 instead of living to 2054.

00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:31.171
Nagel says, but look,
when you try to think about the

00:19:31.171 --> 00:19:34.710
possibility in which instead of
being born in 1954,

00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:39.384
I was born in 1944--and for the
rest of you, you've got to plug

00:19:39.384 --> 00:19:43.380
in your own birthdates--Nagel
says you can't do it.

00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:49.170
The date of my death is a
contingent fact about me.

00:19:49.170 --> 00:19:53.865
But the date of my birth
is not a contingent fact about

00:19:53.865 --> 00:19:55.392
me.
And by birth we don't really

00:19:55.392 --> 00:19:56.779
mean when I came out of the
womb.

00:19:56.779 --> 00:19:59.032
That could be changed,
perhaps by having been

00:19:59.032 --> 00:20:01.234
delivered prematurely,
or through Caesarean,

00:20:01.234 --> 00:20:03.699
or what have you.
We really mean the time at

00:20:03.699 --> 00:20:07.198
which I come into existence.
Let's suppose it's the time

00:20:07.198 --> 00:20:12.593
when the egg and the sperm join.
That's not a contingent moment

00:20:12.593 --> 00:20:16.234
in my story.
That's an essential

00:20:16.234 --> 00:20:19.170
moment in my life story.
How could that be?

00:20:19.170 --> 00:20:22.100
We say, couldn't my parents
have had sex earlier,

00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:24.710
10 years earlier?
Sure they could have.

00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:27.898
But remember,
if they had had sex 10 years

00:20:27.898 --> 00:20:32.408
earlier, it would have been a
different egg and a different

00:20:32.408 --> 00:20:37.579
sperm coming together,
so it wouldn't be me.

00:20:37.579 --> 00:20:41.129
It would be some sibling of
mine that, as it happens,

00:20:41.129 --> 00:20:44.130
never got born.
But if, had they had sex 10

00:20:44.130 --> 00:20:46.994
years earlier,
some sibling would have been

00:20:46.994 --> 00:20:49.707
born.
That's not me being born

00:20:49.707 --> 00:20:51.655
earlier.
Different sperm,

00:20:51.655 --> 00:20:54.779
different egg makes for a
different person.

00:20:54.779 --> 00:20:59.474
So you can't--you can say the
words, "if only I'd been born

00:20:59.474 --> 00:21:04.170
earlier," but it's not actually
metaphysically possible.

00:21:04.170 --> 00:21:07.453
Well, it's an intriguing
suggestion, but I think it can't

00:21:07.453 --> 00:21:09.740
quite be right,
or at the very least,

00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:14.881
it cannot be the complete story
about how to answer Lucretius'

00:21:14.881 --> 00:21:18.197
puzzle.
Suppose we've got a fertility

00:21:18.197 --> 00:21:23.576
clinic that has some sperm on
hold, and has some eggs on hold,

00:21:23.576 --> 00:21:26.574
in the sperm bank,
in the egg bank,

00:21:26.574 --> 00:21:29.726
what have you.
And they keep them here frozen

00:21:29.726 --> 00:21:34.674
until they're ready to use them.
And they thaw them out in

00:21:34.674 --> 00:21:37.600
whatever it is,
2020.

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:41.839
And then the person's born.
Of course, he could go back.

00:21:41.839 --> 00:21:46.326
He could look back and say,
if only they had put my sperm

00:21:46.326 --> 00:21:49.210
and egg together 10 years
earlier.

00:21:49.210 --> 00:21:52.090
That would still be me.
After all, very same sperm,

00:21:52.090 --> 00:21:54.980
very same egg,
makes for the very same person.

00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:58.896
So if only they had combined my
sperm and egg 10 years earlier,

00:21:58.896 --> 00:22:01.549
I would have been born 10 years
earlier.

00:22:01.549 --> 00:22:05.671
Well, so Nagel's wrong in
saying it's not possible to

00:22:05.671 --> 00:22:10.329
imagine being born earlier.
In at least some cases, it is.

00:22:10.329 --> 00:22:12.739
Yet, if we imagine somebody
like this, somebody who's an

00:22:12.739 --> 00:22:14.710
offspring of this kind of
fertility clinic,

00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:18.150
and we ask, would they be upset
that they weren't born earlier?

00:22:18.150 --> 00:22:21.287
again, it still seems as though
most people would say,

00:22:21.287 --> 00:22:24.117
"No, of course not."
So the Nagel answer doesn't

00:22:24.117 --> 00:22:26.039
seem to me to be an adequate
one.

00:22:26.039 --> 00:22:27.619
Well, there's another possible
answer.

00:22:27.619 --> 00:22:30.857
This is Fred Feldman's answer,
also in the one of the papers

00:22:30.857 --> 00:22:33.325
that you've read.
Fred Feldman says--Nagel's a

00:22:33.325 --> 00:22:36.076
contemporary philosopher,
Fred Feldman's a contemporary

00:22:36.076 --> 00:22:38.029
philosopher.
Feldman says,

00:22:38.029 --> 00:22:43.064
when I imagine--suppose I get
killed by the bus in 2044,

00:22:43.064 --> 00:22:47.000
and if I imagine if only I
hadn't died then,

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:53.020
what is it that we imagine?
We imagine instead of living 80

00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:58.900
years, living 90 or 95 or more.
We imagine a longer life.

00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:03.095
But what is it that happens
when I say, if only I'd been

00:23:03.095 --> 00:23:05.763
born earlier?
Well, says Feldman,

00:23:05.763 --> 00:23:09.691
you don't actually imagine a
longer life, you just

00:23:09.691 --> 00:23:13.940
shift the entire life and
start it earlier.

00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:17.910
After all, suppose we just
said--especially if I had asked

00:23:17.910 --> 00:23:22.019
you this question before setting
all of this up--but if only

00:23:22.019 --> 00:23:24.665
you'd been born in 1800.
Nobody thinks,

00:23:24.665 --> 00:23:27.450
"Oh, if only I'd been born in
1800, I'd still be alive.

00:23:27.450 --> 00:23:30.137
I'd be 200 years old."
You think, "Oh,

00:23:30.137 --> 00:23:34.086
if I'd been born in 1800,
I would have died in 1860,1870,

00:23:34.086 --> 00:23:38.325
1880," whatever it is.
When we imagine being born

00:23:38.325 --> 00:23:42.230
earlier, we don't imagine a
longer life.

00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:45.431
Nothing better about having a
life earlier,

00:23:45.431 --> 00:23:47.980
according to the deprivation
account.

00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:51.712
But when we imagine not dying
when we actually die,

00:23:51.712 --> 00:23:55.519
we say, "If only I died in 2050
instead of 2040,"

00:23:55.519 --> 00:23:58.240
it's not that we imagine having
been born later.

00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:02.630
We don't shift the life forward.
We imagine a longer life.

00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:08.272
So, Feldman says,
no wonder, no surprise that you

00:24:08.272 --> 00:24:13.210
care about the nonexistence
after death.

00:24:13.210 --> 00:24:15.660
Because when you imagine
that being different,

00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:17.309
you imagine a longer
life.

00:24:17.309 --> 00:24:20.115
But when you start thinking
about the nonexistence before

00:24:20.115 --> 00:24:22.720
birth and you imagine
that being different,

00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:25.446
you don't imagine more
goods in life,

00:24:25.446 --> 00:24:29.059
you just imagine them taking
place at a different time.

00:24:29.059 --> 00:24:33.569
Well, that's an interesting
possibility, I suppose.

00:24:33.569 --> 00:24:37.508
It doesn't seem to me--again,
that it's got to be--maybe it's

00:24:37.508 --> 00:24:40.592
part of the story,
but it doesn't seem like it's

00:24:40.592 --> 00:24:44.815
going to be the complete story.
Because we could imagine cases

00:24:44.815 --> 00:24:48.410
where the person just thinks,
look, if only I'd been born

00:24:48.410 --> 00:24:51.619
earlier, I would have had
a longer life.

00:24:51.619 --> 00:24:56.505
Let's suppose that next week
astronomers discover the

00:24:56.505 --> 00:25:02.237
horrible fact that there's an
asteroid that's about to land on

00:25:02.237 --> 00:25:06.941
the Earth and wipe out all life.
So here it is,

00:25:06.941 --> 00:25:10.529
it's going to come on January
1,2008.

00:25:10.529 --> 00:25:14.065
And there you are,
at whatever your age is,

00:25:14.065 --> 00:25:16.253
20 years old,
21 years old,

00:25:16.253 --> 00:25:21.471
on January-on December 31,2008
thinking, I've only had 20 years

00:25:21.471 --> 00:25:26.390
of life.
If only I'd been born earlier.

00:25:26.390 --> 00:25:29.134
If only, instead of being born,
whenever it was,

00:25:29.134 --> 00:25:32.579
I'd been born 10 years earlier,
I would have had 30 years of

00:25:32.579 --> 00:25:34.740
life instead of 20 years of
life.

00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:39.059
That seems perfectly
intelligible.

00:25:39.059 --> 00:25:41.951
So it does seem as though,
if we put our head into it,

00:25:41.951 --> 00:25:44.843
we can get ourselves into
thought experiments where we

00:25:44.843 --> 00:25:46.899
say,
yeah, don't just shift the

00:25:46.899 --> 00:25:50.605
life, make it longer.
But instead of making it longer

00:25:50.605 --> 00:25:55.050
in the post-death direction,
make it longer in the pre-birth

00:25:55.050 --> 00:25:57.660
direction.
Again, you can imagine somebody

00:25:57.660 --> 00:25:59.447
saying, "Yeah,
and when we do that,

00:25:59.447 --> 00:26:02.132
we should feel the same."
It doesn't really matter which

00:26:02.132 --> 00:26:05.232
direction it goes.
So symmetry is the right answer

00:26:05.232 --> 00:26:07.715
after all.
When I think about the asteroid

00:26:07.715 --> 00:26:10.974
example, I find myself thinking,
huh, maybe symmetry is

00:26:10.974 --> 00:26:13.591
the right way to go here.
Maybe Feldman's right,

00:26:13.591 --> 00:26:16.140
that normally we just shift
instead of extending.

00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:20.123
But if I'm careful to extend,
maybe that really is bad

00:26:20.123 --> 00:26:24.240
that I didn't get started sooner
and have a longer life in that

00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:26.506
direction.
Well, here's one other answer

00:26:26.506 --> 00:26:28.708
that's been proposed.
This is by yet another

00:26:28.708 --> 00:26:30.869
contemporary philosopher,
Derek Parfit.

00:26:30.869 --> 00:26:35.467
Parfit says,
it's true that when I think

00:26:35.467 --> 00:26:39.829
about the nonexistence after I
die,

00:26:39.829 --> 00:26:43.092
that's loss,
whereas the nonexistence before

00:26:43.092 --> 00:26:46.809
I'm born, that's not loss,
that's mere schmoss.

00:26:46.809 --> 00:26:51.134
And it's true that we need an
explanation about why loss is

00:26:51.134 --> 00:26:56.051
worse than schmoss.
But we can see that this is not

00:26:56.051 --> 00:27:01.890
an arbitrary preference on our
part, because in fact,

00:27:01.890 --> 00:27:06.979
it's part of a quite general
pattern we have of caring about

00:27:06.979 --> 00:27:11.809
the future in a way that we
don't care about the past.

00:27:11.809 --> 00:27:18.130
This is a very deep fact about
human caring.

00:27:18.130 --> 00:27:21.632
We are oriented towards the
future and concerned about what

00:27:21.632 --> 00:27:23.867
happens in it,
in a way that we're not

00:27:23.867 --> 00:27:27.430
oriented and concerned about
what happened in the past.

00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:31.670
Parfit's got a very nice
example to bring the point home.

00:27:31.670 --> 00:27:34.380
He says, imagine that you've
got some condition,

00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:37.782
some medical condition that
will kill you unless you have an

00:27:37.782 --> 00:27:39.066
operation.
So fair enough,

00:27:39.066 --> 00:27:40.210
you're going to have the
operation.

00:27:40.210 --> 00:27:41.609
This will allow you to live
your life.

00:27:41.609 --> 00:27:44.253
Unfortunately,
in order to perform the

00:27:44.253 --> 00:27:47.539
operation, they can't have you
anesthetized.

00:27:47.539 --> 00:27:50.190
You have to be awake,
perhaps in order to tell the

00:27:50.190 --> 00:27:52.192
surgeon "Yeah,
that's where it hurts,"

00:27:52.192 --> 00:27:54.286
whatever it is.
Sort of like when the dentist

00:27:54.286 --> 00:27:55.500
pokes and says,
"Does this hurt?

00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:58.734
Does that hurt?"
So you've got to be awake

00:27:58.734 --> 00:28:03.829
during the operation and it's a
very painful operation.

00:28:03.829 --> 00:28:06.486
We can't give you pain killer,
because then you won't be able

00:28:06.486 --> 00:28:07.726
to point out,
does this hurt,

00:28:07.726 --> 00:28:09.630
does that hurt,
and so forth and so on.

00:28:09.630 --> 00:28:13.710
Since we can't give you pain
killer, all we can do is this.

00:28:13.710 --> 00:28:17.150
So, you'll be awake during
this, basically being tortured.

00:28:17.150 --> 00:28:19.726
You'll be awake being tortured.
It's still worth doing it,

00:28:19.726 --> 00:28:22.842
because this will cure the
condition, so then you'll have a

00:28:22.842 --> 00:28:25.197
nice long life.
Since we can't give you pain

00:28:25.197 --> 00:28:28.170
killers and we can't put you
out, all we're going to do is,

00:28:28.170 --> 00:28:31.521
what we will do is this:
After the operation is over,

00:28:31.521 --> 00:28:34.549
we'll give you this very
powerful medication,

00:28:34.549 --> 00:28:38.962
which will give you short-term,
sort of very localized,

00:28:38.962 --> 00:28:42.961
amnesia.
You won't remember anything

00:28:42.961 --> 00:28:47.568
about the operation itself.
So you won't have to at least

00:28:47.568 --> 00:28:49.868
to dwell upon these horrible
memories of having been

00:28:49.868 --> 00:28:51.892
tortured.
Those will be completely wiped

00:28:51.892 --> 00:28:54.110
out.
Okay, so painful operation.

00:28:54.110 --> 00:28:55.953
You're awake during it.
After the operation,

00:28:55.953 --> 00:28:58.972
you're given this thing that
makes you forget whether you've

00:28:58.972 --> 00:29:01.479
had the operation,
anything about the operation at

00:29:01.479 --> 00:29:03.728
all.
And that the preceding 24 hours

00:29:03.728 --> 00:29:08.053
will be completely wiped out.
So you're in the hospital and

00:29:08.053 --> 00:29:11.452
you wake up and you ask
yourself, "Huh,

00:29:11.452 --> 00:29:15.030
have I had the operation yet or
not?"

00:29:15.030 --> 00:29:16.723
Don't know, right?
Because of course,

00:29:16.723 --> 00:29:18.788
if I haven't had it,
no wonder I don't remember it,

00:29:18.788 --> 00:29:20.925
but if I have had it,
I would have been given that

00:29:20.925 --> 00:29:22.440
temporary sort of localized
amnesia.

00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:24.390
So of course I wouldn't know
whether or not I've had it.

00:29:24.390 --> 00:29:28.281
So you ask the nurse,
"Have I had the operation yet

00:29:28.281 --> 00:29:30.316
or not?"
She says, "I don't know,

00:29:30.316 --> 00:29:32.516
we have a couple on the hall
today who are,

00:29:32.516 --> 00:29:35.500
some of whom have had it and
some of whom are scheduled to

00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:38.207
have it later today.
I don't remember which one you

00:29:38.207 --> 00:29:41.690
are.
Let me go look at your file.

00:29:41.690 --> 00:29:43.360
I'll come back and I'll tell
you."

00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:46.259
So she wanders off.
She's going to come back in a

00:29:46.259 --> 00:29:49.307
minute or two.
And as you're waiting for her

00:29:49.307 --> 00:29:51.663
to come back,
you ask yourself,

00:29:51.663 --> 00:29:54.569
what do you want the answer to
be?

00:29:54.569 --> 00:29:57.921
Are you indifferent,
or do you care whether you're

00:29:57.921 --> 00:30:02.094
one of the people who's already
had it, or somebody who hasn't

00:30:02.094 --> 00:30:04.467
yet had it?
Now, if you're like Parfit,

00:30:04.467 --> 00:30:06.912
and for that matter,
like me, then you're going to

00:30:06.912 --> 00:30:10.174
say, of course I care.
I want it to be the case that

00:30:10.174 --> 00:30:13.577
I'm one of the people who's
already had the

00:30:13.577 --> 00:30:16.915
operation.
I don't want to be one of the

00:30:16.915 --> 00:30:20.359
people who hasn't yet had the
operation.

00:30:20.359 --> 00:30:22.880
You might say,
how can that make any sense?

00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:26.519
Your life's going to have the
operation sooner or later.

00:30:26.519 --> 00:30:29.992
At some point in your life
history, that operation is going

00:30:29.992 --> 00:30:32.647
to have occurred.
And so there's the same amount

00:30:32.647 --> 00:30:35.074
of pain and torture,
regardless of whether you're

00:30:35.074 --> 00:30:38.058
one of the people that had it
yesterday or one of the people

00:30:38.058 --> 00:30:39.980
that's going to have it
tomorrow.

00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:41.782
But for all that,
says Parfit,

00:30:41.782 --> 00:30:44.331
the fact of the matter is
perfectly plain,

00:30:44.331 --> 00:30:48.893
that we do care.
We want the pain to be in the

00:30:48.893 --> 00:30:52.669
past.
We don't want the pain to be in

00:30:52.669 --> 00:30:56.193
the future.
We care more about what's

00:30:56.193 --> 00:31:01.789
happening in the future than we
care about what's happening in

00:31:01.789 --> 00:31:04.522
the past.
That being the case,

00:31:04.522 --> 00:31:09.419
no surprise we care about the
nonexistence in the future in a

00:31:09.419 --> 00:31:13.990
way we don't care about the
nonexistence in the past.

00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:17.562
Well, that may be right as far
as explanation goes,

00:31:17.562 --> 00:31:21.563
but we might still wonder
whether or not it's any kind of

00:31:21.563 --> 00:31:25.145
justification.
The fact that we've got this

00:31:25.145 --> 00:31:29.738
deep-seated asymmetrical
attitude towards time doesn't in

00:31:29.738 --> 00:31:32.199
any way,
as far as I can see,

00:31:32.199 --> 00:31:36.174
yet tell us whether or not
that's a justified

00:31:36.174 --> 00:31:38.579
attitude.
Maybe evolution built us to

00:31:38.579 --> 00:31:41.735
care about the future in a way
that we don't care about the

00:31:41.735 --> 00:31:44.130
past and this shows up in lots
of places,

00:31:44.130 --> 00:31:47.928
including Parfit's hospital
case, including our attitude

00:31:47.928 --> 00:31:51.190
towards loss versus schmoss,
and so forth and so on.

00:31:51.190 --> 00:31:55.090
But the fact that we've got
this attitude doesn't yet show

00:31:55.090 --> 00:31:57.759
that it's a rational
attitude.

00:31:57.759 --> 00:32:00.079
How could we show that it's a
rational attitude?

00:32:00.079 --> 00:32:02.759
Well, maybe we'd have to start
doing some heavy-duty

00:32:02.759 --> 00:32:05.544
metaphysics, if what we've been
doing so far isn't yet

00:32:05.544 --> 00:32:08.416
heavy-duty enough.
Maybe we need to talk about the

00:32:08.416 --> 00:32:11.405
difference between--the
metaphysical difference between

00:32:11.405 --> 00:32:14.337
the past and the future.
The past is fixed,

00:32:14.337 --> 00:32:17.769
the future is open,
the direction of time.

00:32:17.769 --> 00:32:23.257
Maybe somehow we could bring
all these things in and explain

00:32:23.257 --> 00:32:27.350
why our attitudes towards time
make sense.

00:32:27.350 --> 00:32:32.509
I'm not going to go there.
All I want to say is it's not

00:32:32.509 --> 00:32:39.480
altogether obvious what the best
answer to Lucretius' puzzle is.

00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:42.469
So when I say,
as I have said--and I'm going

00:32:42.469 --> 00:32:46.085
to say it many times over the
course of the remaining

00:32:46.085 --> 00:32:50.117
weeks--that the central thing
that's bad about death is the

00:32:50.117 --> 00:32:54.220
fact that you're deprived of the
good things in life,

00:32:54.220 --> 00:32:56.891
when I make use of the
deprivation account,

00:32:56.891 --> 00:33:00.072
I don't mean to suggest
everything is sweetness and

00:33:00.072 --> 00:33:03.190
light with regard to the
deprivation account.

00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:07.855
I think there are some residual
puzzles about how it could be

00:33:07.855 --> 00:33:10.637
that death is bad.
And in particular,

00:33:10.637 --> 00:33:14.184
how it could be that the
deprivation account puts its

00:33:14.184 --> 00:33:16.640
finger on what's bad about
death.

00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:19.945
But for all that,
it seems to me the right way to

00:33:19.945 --> 00:33:21.927
go.
It seems to me that the

00:33:21.927 --> 00:33:26.412
deprivation account does put its
finger on the central bad thing

00:33:26.412 --> 00:33:28.632
about death.
Most centrally,

00:33:28.632 --> 00:33:32.242
what's bad about death is that
when you're dead,

00:33:32.242 --> 00:33:36.160
you're not experiencing the
good things in life.

00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:41.221
Death is bad for you because
you don't have what life would

00:33:41.221 --> 00:33:44.450
bring you, if only you hadn't
died.

00:33:44.450 --> 00:33:46.897
All right.
If that's right,

00:33:46.897 --> 00:33:50.070
should we conclude,
in fact, do we have to

00:33:50.070 --> 00:33:53.970
conclude--if death is bad
because of it's a deprivation,

00:33:53.970 --> 00:33:57.255
then if I wasn't dead,
I wouldn't be deprived--so

00:33:57.255 --> 00:34:01.363
doesn't it follow then that the
best thing of all is never to

00:34:01.363 --> 00:34:06.480
die at all,
to wit, immortality?

00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:09.253
If it's bad--suppose I get hit
by a truck next week,

00:34:09.253 --> 00:34:12.570
that's bad, because if only I
hadn't gotten hit by a truck,

00:34:12.570 --> 00:34:15.769
I might have lived another
20,30 years, whatever.

00:34:15.769 --> 00:34:17.957
I would have gotten the good
things in life that would have

00:34:17.957 --> 00:34:20.373
been better for me.
Ah, but when I die of whatever

00:34:20.373 --> 00:34:23.782
it is, some heart disease at age
80, that's bad maybe because if

00:34:23.782 --> 00:34:25.730
only I didn't have heart
disease,

00:34:25.730 --> 00:34:27.559
I could have lived another
10,15, 20 years,

00:34:27.559 --> 00:34:29.039
gotten more good things in
life.

00:34:29.039 --> 00:34:31.491
If only I hadn't died at 100,
I would have gotten more good

00:34:31.491 --> 00:34:33.485
things in life.
If only I hadn't died at 500,

00:34:33.485 --> 00:34:35.510
I would have gotten more good
things in life.

00:34:35.510 --> 00:34:38.767
Whenever it is I die,
won't it always be true,

00:34:38.767 --> 00:34:41.210
if we accept the deprivation
account,

00:34:41.210 --> 00:34:44.297
that if only I hadn't died
then, I would have gotten more

00:34:44.297 --> 00:34:47.586
good things in life?
And so whenever it is you die,

00:34:47.586 --> 00:34:53.571
death is bad for you.
So the best thing for you would

00:34:53.571 --> 00:34:57.889
be never to die,
immortality.

00:34:57.889 --> 00:35:00.050
Two questions really that we
need to ask.

00:35:00.050 --> 00:35:05.439
One is: Does consistency,
does logic, require somebody

00:35:05.439 --> 00:35:10.727
who accepts the deprivation
account--does consistency

00:35:10.727 --> 00:35:16.320
require that if you accept the
deprivation account,

00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:20.349
you believe immortality's a
good thing?

00:35:20.349 --> 00:35:23.613
Second question:
Even if logic doesn't require

00:35:23.613 --> 00:35:27.820
that, is it true that
immortality's a good thing?

00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:30.540
Let me start with the first
one, because I think that's the

00:35:30.540 --> 00:35:32.125
easier one.
Logic alone,

00:35:32.125 --> 00:35:36.434
logic plus the consistency
requirement--rather and the

00:35:36.434 --> 00:35:41.068
deprivation account--logic alone
doesn't require us to say

00:35:41.068 --> 00:35:44.599
immortality's a good thing.
Why?

00:35:44.599 --> 00:35:49.196
Because strictly speaking,
what the deprivation account

00:35:49.196 --> 00:35:54.219
says is, death is bad insofar as
you're deprived of the good

00:35:54.219 --> 00:35:58.050
things in life by virtue of not
existing.

00:35:58.050 --> 00:36:00.529
If only you hadn't gotten hit
by that truck,

00:36:00.529 --> 00:36:03.930
you would have gone on to an
exciting life in your career as

00:36:03.930 --> 00:36:06.379
a professional dancer.
You would have had a family,

00:36:06.379 --> 00:36:07.920
or what have you.
Whatever it is.

00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:09.380
You would have traveled around
the world.

00:36:09.380 --> 00:36:12.353
Life would have given you a lot
of great things and you get

00:36:12.353 --> 00:36:15.378
deprived of those great things,
that's why it's bad that you

00:36:15.378 --> 00:36:17.769
got hit by the truck.
That is to say,

00:36:17.769 --> 00:36:19.768
death is bad,
when it's bad,

00:36:19.768 --> 00:36:24.208
by virtue of the fact that it
deprives you of the good things

00:36:24.208 --> 00:36:27.199
in life.
But suppose--we don't yet know

00:36:27.199 --> 00:36:30.851
whether this could actually
happen, but here we're just

00:36:30.851 --> 00:36:34.097
talking about logical
possibilities--suppose that

00:36:34.097 --> 00:36:37.750
there's no more good things for
life to give you.

00:36:37.750 --> 00:36:40.786
Then when you're deprived of
life by death,

00:36:40.786 --> 00:36:43.968
you're not being deprived of
any good things,

00:36:43.968 --> 00:36:48.090
and so it's not bad for you to
be dead at that point.

00:36:48.090 --> 00:36:51.418
Death is only bad,
according to the deprivation

00:36:51.418 --> 00:36:55.761
account, when there are good
things that would have come your

00:36:55.761 --> 00:36:57.828
way.
When, as we might put it,

00:36:57.828 --> 00:37:01.518
on balance, the life you would
have had would have continued to

00:37:01.518 --> 00:37:04.150
be good for you.
When that happens,

00:37:04.150 --> 00:37:08.820
then to lose that good bit of
life, that's bad for you.

00:37:08.820 --> 00:37:12.290
But if it should turn out that
what life would have had

00:37:12.290 --> 00:37:15.953
hereafter, instead of being
good, would have been hellish,

00:37:15.953 --> 00:37:18.460
it's not bad for you to avoid
that.

00:37:18.460 --> 00:37:21.730
It might actually be
good for you to avoid it.

00:37:21.730 --> 00:37:25.784
So, even if we accept the
deprivation account,

00:37:25.784 --> 00:37:31.190
we're not committed to the
claim that death is always bad.

00:37:31.190 --> 00:37:36.811
We have to look and see,
what would life actually hold

00:37:36.811 --> 00:37:39.076
out for us?
Logic alone,

00:37:39.076 --> 00:37:42.917
plus the deprivation account,
doesn't force us to say

00:37:42.917 --> 00:37:45.650
immortality would be a good
thing.

00:37:45.650 --> 00:37:49.494
After all--this is really a
crucial point to

00:37:49.494 --> 00:37:54.947
understand--things that are good
for you in limited quantities

00:37:54.947 --> 00:38:00.221
can become bad for you if you
get more and more and more and

00:38:00.221 --> 00:38:03.150
more of them.
Well, I love chocolate.

00:38:03.150 --> 00:38:05.558
So suppose somebody comes up to
me with a box of Godiva

00:38:05.558 --> 00:38:07.610
chocolate, offers me a couple of
chocolates.

00:38:07.610 --> 00:38:10.489
I say, "Wonderful!
I love Godiva chocolate."

00:38:10.489 --> 00:38:13.390
And then they give me some more
and some more.

00:38:13.390 --> 00:38:15.540
Twenty pieces of chocolate.
Well, you know,

00:38:15.540 --> 00:38:18.373
by the time I got 20 pieces of
chocolate, I'm not sure right

00:38:18.373 --> 00:38:20.389
now if I really want the 21^(st)
piece.

00:38:20.389 --> 00:38:21.679
But you keep giving me some
more.

00:38:21.679 --> 00:38:23.837
Thirty pieces of chocolate,
40 pieces of chocolate,

00:38:23.837 --> 00:38:26.468
100 pieces of chocolate.
At some point--I've never

00:38:26.468 --> 00:38:29.568
actually had his much chocolate;
I don't know what the point is,

00:38:29.568 --> 00:38:31.070
but at some point--I'm
going to say,

00:38:31.070 --> 00:38:33.332
you know,
although the first 10,20,

00:38:33.332 --> 00:38:36.190
30 pieces of chocolate,
those were good,

00:38:36.190 --> 00:38:40.441
but giving me the 21^(st) piece
of chocolate or the 50^(th)

00:38:40.441 --> 00:38:44.690
piece of chocolate,
no longer good.

00:38:44.690 --> 00:38:47.190
Logically, at least,
it could happen.

00:38:47.190 --> 00:38:50.989
Logically, it could happen that
although in quantities,

00:38:50.989 --> 00:38:53.030
small quantities,
50 years,

00:38:53.030 --> 00:38:55.606
60 years, 100 years,
life is good,

00:38:55.606 --> 00:38:58.963
at some point,
maybe life would turn bad for

00:38:58.963 --> 00:39:00.782
us.
Just like being force-fed more

00:39:00.782 --> 00:39:01.630
and more chocolate.

00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:09.021
And if it did turn bad for us,
the deprivation account would

00:39:09.021 --> 00:39:11.477
allow us to say,
oh, at that point,

00:39:11.477 --> 00:39:14.806
dying's not bad for you.
Well, that's all that logic

00:39:14.806 --> 00:39:17.493
tells us.
Logic simply tells us we don't

00:39:17.493 --> 00:39:21.239
have to believe
immortality's a good thing.

00:39:21.239 --> 00:39:24.034
But for all that,
it could still be a good

00:39:24.034 --> 00:39:25.550
thing.
So that's question number two.

00:39:25.550 --> 00:39:31.039
Let's ask, what should we think
about the prospect of living

00:39:31.039 --> 00:39:33.519
forever?
Would it, in fact,

00:39:33.519 --> 00:39:36.360
be better and better and
better?

00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:39.085
Somebody dies at age 10 by some
horrible disease,

00:39:39.085 --> 00:39:41.130
better if they'd made it up to
40.

00:39:41.130 --> 00:39:43.912
Somebody dies at age 40,
better if they'd made it up to

00:39:43.912 --> 00:39:45.661
80.
Somebody dies at age 80,

00:39:45.661 --> 00:39:47.960
better if they'd made it to
100,120.

00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:53.179
Is it true that life would get
better and better and better,

00:39:53.179 --> 00:39:57.651
the longer it is?
Now, in asking this question,

00:39:57.651 --> 00:40:03.138
we have to be careful to be
clear about what exactly we're

00:40:03.138 --> 00:40:05.808
imagining.
Here's one way to try to

00:40:05.808 --> 00:40:10.043
imagine that story.
Imagine that life is sort of

00:40:10.043 --> 00:40:15.604
the way it works now,
with the kinds of changes that

00:40:15.604 --> 00:40:19.530
bodies undergo as they get
older.

00:40:19.530 --> 00:40:23.947
But instead of those changes
basically killing you at 80,90,

00:40:23.947 --> 00:40:28.047
or 100, they don't.
You get more and more of those

00:40:28.047 --> 00:40:31.670
changes, but they never actually
kill you.

00:40:31.670 --> 00:40:35.274
This is the sort of thought
experiment that Jonathan Swift

00:40:35.274 --> 00:40:39.069
undertakes in the passage from
Gulliver's Travels that

00:40:39.069 --> 00:40:43.385
I've had you look at.
He imagines Gulliver coming to

00:40:43.385 --> 00:40:48.034
a country where a subset of the
people live forever,

00:40:48.034 --> 00:40:49.707
immortals.
And at first,

00:40:49.707 --> 00:40:51.320
Gulliver says,
"Oh, isn't this wonderful?"

00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:56.698
But he forgot to think about
the fact that if the kinds of

00:40:56.698 --> 00:41:01.039
changes that we undergo continue
to accumulate,

00:41:01.039 --> 00:41:05.368
then you're getting older.
Not just older,

00:41:05.368 --> 00:41:10.962
but weaker, in more and more
discomfort, senility sets in

00:41:10.962 --> 00:41:15.609
with a vengeance,
until eventually you've got

00:41:15.609 --> 00:41:21.400
these creatures that live
forever, but their mind is gone,

00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:25.043
and they're sort of in pain and
they can't do anything because

00:41:25.043 --> 00:41:28.150
their body's utterly infirm and
diseased and sick.

00:41:28.150 --> 00:41:31.739
That's not a wonderful thing to
have.

00:41:31.739 --> 00:41:35.108
If immortality was like
that, says Swift,

00:41:35.108 --> 00:41:39.825
that would be horrible.
For an immortality like that,

00:41:39.825 --> 00:41:43.576
death would be a blessing.
And Montaigne,

00:41:43.576 --> 00:41:47.314
in the essay that I've had you
look at, says indeed,

00:41:47.314 --> 00:41:52.435
death is a blessing,
because it puts an end to the

00:41:52.435 --> 00:41:59.780
pain and suffering and misery
that afflict us in our old age.

00:41:59.780 --> 00:42:03.387
Well, all of that seems right,
but I suppose we'd be forgiven

00:42:03.387 --> 00:42:04.650
for thinking,
look,

00:42:04.650 --> 00:42:09.365
when we wanted to be immortal,
we didn't want this kind

00:42:09.365 --> 00:42:13.850
of life going on and on and on
with the same trajectory,

00:42:13.850 --> 00:42:18.699
the same downward trajectory.
We sort of wanted to live

00:42:18.699 --> 00:42:22.500
forever, hail and hearty and
healthy.

00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:26.361
So even if the real world
wouldn't allow us that,

00:42:26.361 --> 00:42:31.188
let's just ask science fictiony
whether or not in fact living

00:42:31.188 --> 00:42:36.157
forever would be good.
Isn't it at least true that in

00:42:36.157 --> 00:42:40.090
principle, living forever could
be good?

00:42:40.090 --> 00:42:44.701
You've got to imagine changing
some of the facts about what it

00:42:44.701 --> 00:42:48.431
would be like to live forever.
So instead of asking the

00:42:48.431 --> 00:42:51.818
question, the question I started
with, would it be good to live

00:42:51.818 --> 00:42:53.207
forever?
--If you're not careful,

00:42:53.207 --> 00:42:54.914
this is going to be like one of
those horror stories,

00:42:54.914 --> 00:42:57.146
right?
Where you've got a couple of

00:42:57.146 --> 00:43:01.296
wishes and you aren't careful
about how exactly you state the

00:43:01.296 --> 00:43:03.084
wish.
And so you get what you want,

00:43:03.084 --> 00:43:04.829
but it ends up being a
nightmare, right?

00:43:04.829 --> 00:43:08.387
If you just tell the fairy who
gives you three wishes,

00:43:08.387 --> 00:43:11.727
"I want to live forever,"
and you forgot to say "and be

00:43:11.727 --> 00:43:15.100
sure to keep me healthy," well,
that's going to be a nightmare.

00:43:15.100 --> 00:43:19.530
That's what Swift told us.
So let's be careful.

00:43:19.530 --> 00:43:23.559
Let's throw in health and
anything else you want.

00:43:23.559 --> 00:43:26.922
Throw in enough money to make
sure you're not poor for

00:43:26.922 --> 00:43:28.802
eternity.
Wouldn't that be horrible,

00:43:28.802 --> 00:43:30.940
to be healthy but
impoverished forever?

00:43:30.940 --> 00:43:37.385
Throw in whatever you want.
All we need to ask at that this

00:43:37.385 --> 00:43:42.002
point is, is there any way at
all to imagine immortality,

00:43:42.002 --> 00:43:46.619
where immortality of that sort
would be a good thing?

00:43:46.619 --> 00:43:51.003
Is there any way to imagine
existing forever where that

00:43:51.003 --> 00:43:54.250
would be good for you,
forever?

00:43:54.250 --> 00:43:56.542
Now, it's very tempting at this
point to say,

00:43:56.542 --> 00:43:58.869
look, of course.
Nothing could be easier.

00:43:58.869 --> 00:44:04.358
Just imagine being in
heaven forever,

00:44:04.358 --> 00:44:06.370
right?
You're done, right?

00:44:06.370 --> 00:44:09.230
You've got heavenly bliss.
Isn't this incredible?

00:44:09.230 --> 00:44:12.730
Wouldn't we all love to be in
heaven forever?

00:44:12.730 --> 00:44:16.530
The trouble is,
we were a little bit vague

00:44:16.530 --> 00:44:20.610
about what exactly life is like
in heaven.

00:44:20.610 --> 00:44:27.155
It's a striking fact that even
those religions that promise us

00:44:27.155 --> 00:44:32.950
an eternity in heaven are rather
shy on the details.

00:44:32.950 --> 00:44:36.542
Why?
Because, one might worry,

00:44:36.542 --> 00:44:39.838
if you actually tried to fill
in the details,

00:44:39.838 --> 00:44:43.133
this wonderful,
eternal existence ends up not

00:44:43.133 --> 00:44:48.217
seeming so wonderful after all.
So imagine that what's going to

00:44:48.217 --> 00:44:52.760
happen is that we all become
angels and we're going to spend

00:44:52.760 --> 00:44:56.588
eternity singing psalms.
Now, I like psalms and I

00:44:56.588 --> 00:45:00.230
actually enjoy rather singing
psalms at services.

00:45:00.230 --> 00:45:04.722
On Saturday mornings,
I sing psalms in Hebrew and I

00:45:04.722 --> 00:45:07.856
rather enjoy it.
But if you ask me:

00:45:07.856 --> 00:45:12.659
What about the possibility of
an eternity of doing that?

00:45:12.659 --> 00:45:18.440
That doesn't really seem so
desirable.

00:45:18.440 --> 00:45:20.920
Bedazzled,
not the remake.

00:45:20.920 --> 00:45:22.809
I haven't seen the remake,
but the original.

00:45:22.809 --> 00:45:27.322
In the original,
there's a human character who

00:45:27.322 --> 00:45:31.730
hooks up with the devil.
He meets the devil and he asks

00:45:31.730 --> 00:45:34.550
the devil, "So why did you rebel
against God?"

00:45:34.550 --> 00:45:35.550
The devil says,
"Well, I'll show you.

00:45:35.550 --> 00:45:41.422
You sit here on the--" whatever
it was, the mailbox,

00:45:41.422 --> 00:45:44.244
I think it was.
"I'll sit up here on the

00:45:44.244 --> 00:45:46.636
mailbox," the devil says.
"And you dance around me and

00:45:46.636 --> 00:45:49.290
say, ‘Oh, praise the lord,
aren't you wonderful?

00:45:49.290 --> 00:45:51.039
You're so magnificent.
You're so glorious.'"

00:45:51.039 --> 00:45:53.019
And the human does this for a
while and he says,

00:45:53.019 --> 00:45:55.769
"This has gotten really boring.
Can't we switch?"

00:45:55.769 --> 00:45:59.079
And the devil says,
"That's exactly what I said."

00:45:59.079 --> 00:46:04.685
Now, when you try to imagine
heaven singing psalms for

00:46:04.685 --> 00:46:09.340
eternity, that doesn't seem so
attractive.

00:46:09.340 --> 00:46:12.724
All right, so don't imagine
heaven singing psalms for

00:46:12.724 --> 00:46:15.980
eternity.
Just imagine something else.

00:46:15.980 --> 00:46:18.789
But what?
Imagine what?

00:46:18.789 --> 00:46:23.833
This is the thought experiment
that I invite you to participate

00:46:23.833 --> 00:46:26.829
in.
What kind of life can you

00:46:26.829 --> 00:46:32.940
imagine, such that having that
life forever would be good?

00:46:32.940 --> 00:46:36.823
Not just for another 10 years,
not just for another 100 years,

00:46:36.823 --> 00:46:40.005
not just for another 1,000
years, or million years,

00:46:40.005 --> 00:46:44.492
or a billion years.
Remember, eternity is a very,

00:46:44.492 --> 00:46:50.440
very long time.
Forever goes on forever.

00:46:50.440 --> 00:46:56.960
Can you describe an existence
that you would want to be stuck

00:46:56.960 --> 00:47:00.110
with forever?
Now, it's precisely at this

00:47:00.110 --> 00:47:03.375
point that Bernard Williams,
in another one of the papers I

00:47:03.375 --> 00:47:06.360
had you take a look at--Bernard
Williams says no .

00:47:06.360 --> 00:47:11.266
No kind of life would be one
that would be desirable and

00:47:11.266 --> 00:47:18.010
attractive forever.
No kind of life at all.

00:47:18.010 --> 00:47:23.039
In short, says Williams,
every life would eventually

00:47:23.039 --> 00:47:28.070
become tedious and worse,
excruciatingly painful.

00:47:28.070 --> 00:47:34.013
Every kind of life is a life
you would eventually want to be

00:47:34.013 --> 00:47:36.343
rid of.
Immortality,

00:47:36.343 --> 00:47:42.512
far from being a wonderful
thing, would be a horrible

00:47:42.512 --> 00:47:44.756
thing.
Suppose, for the moment,

00:47:44.756 --> 00:47:46.570
that we were to agree with
Williams.

00:47:46.570 --> 00:47:49.635
What then should we say?
We might say--look,

00:47:49.635 --> 00:47:54.149
at least when we're being
careful, if we agree that

00:47:54.149 --> 00:47:59.024
immortality would be bad,
we can't say then that death,

00:47:59.024 --> 00:48:03.331
per se, is bad.
The very fact that I am going

00:48:03.331 --> 00:48:08.249
to die turns out not to be a bad
thing, because after all,

00:48:08.249 --> 00:48:12.389
the only alternative to dying
is immortality.

00:48:12.389 --> 00:48:14.917
And if immortality would be a
bad thing,

00:48:14.917 --> 00:48:17.060
then death is not a bad
thing.

00:48:17.060 --> 00:48:20.691
Death is a good thing.
We might say,

00:48:20.691 --> 00:48:26.552
if we accept Williams' thought,
the fact of our mortality is

00:48:26.552 --> 00:48:31.717
good rather than bad,
if immortality would eventually

00:48:31.717 --> 00:48:33.813
be bad.
Now of course,

00:48:33.813 --> 00:48:37.684
crucial to notice that even if
we say this, that doesn't mean

00:48:37.684 --> 00:48:41.620
that when you get hit by a car
tomorrow, that that's good.

00:48:41.620 --> 00:48:45.291
You don't have to say that.
You can still say it's a bad

00:48:45.291 --> 00:48:48.920
thing that I got hit by a car
tomorrow, because after all,

00:48:48.920 --> 00:48:52.216
if I hadn't gotten hit by a car
tomorrow, it's not as though I

00:48:52.216 --> 00:48:54.539
would have been condemned to
immortality,

00:48:54.539 --> 00:48:57.329
I just would have lived another
10 or 20 or 30 years.

00:48:57.329 --> 00:49:01.559
And those years would have been
good ones for me.

00:49:01.559 --> 00:49:05.157
And maybe even when I
die--let's suppose I live to the

00:49:05.157 --> 00:49:07.940
ripe old age of 100--when I die
at 100,

00:49:07.940 --> 00:49:12.889
I could perhaps still say,
it's a bad thing for me that I

00:49:12.889 --> 00:49:16.728
die at the age of 100.
Because if I hadn't died now,

00:49:16.728 --> 00:49:19.749
I might have lived another
10,20, 30 years and still

00:49:19.749 --> 00:49:23.885
enjoyed things in life,
enjoyed playing with my great

00:49:23.885 --> 00:49:26.659
grandchildren,
whatever it is.

00:49:26.659 --> 00:49:33.065
To say that immortality is bad
is not to say it's a good thing

00:49:33.065 --> 00:49:37.882
that we die when we do.
You can still believe

00:49:37.882 --> 00:49:43.730
consistency--consistently--that
we die too soon.

00:49:43.730 --> 00:49:48.875
Even if in principle,
eventually, sooner or later,

00:49:48.875 --> 00:49:54.965
death would no longer be bad,
it could be that it comes too

00:49:54.965 --> 00:49:59.823
soon for all of us.
Still, the question we want to

00:49:59.823 --> 00:50:04.956
ask is, is there any way even to
imagine an immortal life

00:50:04.956 --> 00:50:08.285
that would be worth having?
In principle,

00:50:08.285 --> 00:50:10.670
could immortality be a good
thing?

00:50:10.670 --> 00:50:13.659
Or, is Williams right,
that no, even in principle,

00:50:13.659 --> 00:50:16.769
go as fantastic and science
fictiony as you want,

00:50:16.769 --> 00:50:20.789
in principle an immortal life
could not be desirable?

00:50:20.789 --> 00:50:24.024
So until next time,
I invite you to think that

00:50:24.024 --> 00:50:27.443
question through.
If you're trapped into the

00:50:27.443 --> 00:50:31.788
prospect of immortality,
what would the best kind

00:50:31.788 --> 00:50:33.521
of immortal life be like?

00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:04.043
Prof: Okay,
so last time we were talking

00:00:04.043 --> 00:00:07.632
about exponents,
and how statistics gives rise

00:00:07.632 --> 00:00:08.310
to them.
 

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:10.450
And we looked last time at the
Boltzmann factor,

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:15.600
that e^-H/RT^( )or
ΔH/RT,

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.597
which tells you the temperature
dependence of the equilibrium

00:00:19.597 --> 00:00:20.330
constant.
 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:21.780
It gives you the equilibrium
constant;

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:26.246
remember at room temperatures
3/4thsΔH in

00:00:26.246 --> 00:00:27.341
kilocalories.
 

00:00:27.341 --> 00:00:28.100
Right?
 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:32.152
And we saw last time that that
comes from counting arrangements

00:00:32.152 --> 00:00:34.440
of a fixed number of energy
bits.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.654
And the important thing is that
they're random,

00:00:37.654 --> 00:00:40.310
that all of them are equally
likely.

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:43.550
&lt;&lt;Technical
adjustment&gt;&gt;

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.567
That has interesting
philosophical implications I

00:00:46.567 --> 00:00:47.070
think.
 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.613
Do you remember at the start of
the course we were talking about

00:00:51.613 --> 00:00:53.920
types of authority,
and in particular,

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.981
remember, in Hamlet,
Act V, Scene II,

00:00:55.981 --> 00:00:59.526
he says, "There's a
divinity that shapes our

00:00:59.526 --> 00:01:00.560
ends."
 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.120
So this was a traditional view
in society.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.530
But then this guy came along,
in 1859.

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.659
Do you know who that is?
 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:12.659
Charles Darwin,
with The Origin of the

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:13.360
Species.
 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.168
So there was conflict between
the religious fundamentalists

00:01:17.168 --> 00:01:20.060
and Darwinists that continues to
this day.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.644
But I think they really miss
the point, because Darwin had

00:01:23.644 --> 00:01:27.040
the idea that things were
developing and getting better

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:27.858
all the time.
 

00:01:27.858 --> 00:01:28.549
Right?
 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:32.016
So there's a certain
compatibility between that and

00:01:32.016 --> 00:01:35.000
the sensibilities of the
fundamentalists.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.952
But also, not too long from
then, this guy came along,

00:01:38.952 --> 00:01:42.681
Boltzmann, and he said
everything is driven just by

00:01:42.681 --> 00:01:43.800
randomness.
 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.140
There's no goal for everything.
 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.842
That should be the real
conflict, between religious

00:01:48.842 --> 00:01:51.220
fundamentalists and science,
is Boltzmann.

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.101
But so few people understand
what Boltzmann did that there's

00:01:55.101 --> 00:01:57.010
no reason for the conflict.
 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:59.364
At any rate,
we saw where the Boltzmann

00:01:59.364 --> 00:02:02.030
factor came from,
in terms of statistics.

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.659
Then there's the entropy
factor, which we saw last time.

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:08.000
And notice that,
as I've written it here,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.516
in the top equation,
the one with Boltzmann,

00:02:10.516 --> 00:02:13.502
there's an R,
and the one at the bottom has a

00:02:13.502 --> 00:02:14.378
k.
 

00:02:14.378 --> 00:02:17.240
Sometimes you see R's
and sometimes see k's.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.090
They're actually the same thing.
 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.217
The k is if you measure
the energy per molecule,

00:02:23.217 --> 00:02:27.270
and R is if you measure
the energy per mole.

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:30.522
So all you have is Avogadro's
number is included in one of

00:02:30.522 --> 00:02:31.949
them and not the other.
 

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:34.538
They're really the same thing,
these two exponentials.

00:02:34.538 --> 00:02:38.652
But at any rate,
we can cancel the T's

00:02:38.652 --> 00:02:43.045
and know that that
e^S/k^( )is a counting

00:02:43.045 --> 00:02:46.305
number, W;
the number of molecular

00:02:46.305 --> 00:02:47.770
structures being grouped.
 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.366
And we saw that at the end of
last time in terms of gauche-

00:02:51.366 --> 00:02:52.669
versus anti-butane.
 

00:02:52.669 --> 00:02:57.131
And remember that S = ln
k -- which is the same

00:02:57.131 --> 00:03:02.520
equation, just the log on each
side -- is on Boltzmann's tomb.

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:07.020
But let's look at one more
example, in terms of

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.389
cyclohexane.
 

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:13.284
Do you remember the cyclohexane
conorformers --

00:03:13.284 --> 00:03:17.330
&lt;&lt;technical
adjustment&gt;&gt;

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:21.632
-- remember the cyclohexane
conformers, if it's a chair,

00:03:21.632 --> 00:03:23.038
it's very rigid.
 

00:03:23.038 --> 00:03:23.907
Why is it rigid?
 

00:03:23.907 --> 00:03:24.830
Do you remember?
 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:28.250
Why is it hard to twist?
 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:33.789
With respect to the molecular
model, why is it hard to twist?

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:36.699
Eric?
 

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:40.758
Why does this particular model,
in which rotation around bonds

00:03:40.758 --> 00:03:44.018
is completely free,
why is it hard to rotate to go

00:03:44.018 --> 00:03:44.949
like this?
 

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:46.919
Why is there a click?
 

00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:49.610
Student: 
&gt;.

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:50.560
Prof: Pardon me?
 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.387
Student:  It has the
optimal bending angles,

00:03:52.387 --> 00:03:52.680
109.5.
 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.705
Prof: Ah,
it's the bending angle that has

00:03:54.705 --> 00:03:56.169
to flatten out when you do this.
 

00:03:56.169 --> 00:03:57.030
Remember we talked about that.
 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:58.979
But anyhow this one is very
rigid.

00:03:58.979 --> 00:04:01.295
But if you click it,
into the boat,

00:04:01.295 --> 00:04:05.316
then it's actually a twist-boat
and it turns to all sorts of

00:04:05.316 --> 00:04:07.360
structures ever so easily.
 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:12.229
So there are many more
accessible structures for a

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:15.710
boat, than there are for a
chair.

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:19.822
The chair, you have this one
and you have this one.

00:04:19.822 --> 00:04:20.480
Right?
 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:21.935
But for a boat,
or a twisted,

00:04:21.935 --> 00:04:24.899
or the "flexible"
form as it's often called,

00:04:24.899 --> 00:04:27.480
you have lots and lots of
accessible structures.

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.360
What's that going to mean in
terms of entropy?

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:34.086
That there are many more
structures you're going to count

00:04:34.086 --> 00:04:38.728
for the flexible form than you
count for the chair form,

00:04:38.728 --> 00:04:39.995
the rigid form.
 

00:04:39.995 --> 00:04:40.839
Okay?
 

00:04:40.839 --> 00:04:45.033
So if we look at -- this is a
picture of the energy with the

00:04:45.033 --> 00:04:47.379
chair at the minimum of energy.
 

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:50.666
The twist-boat is 5.5
kilocalories above,

00:04:50.666 --> 00:04:55.267
but it has very small barriers
among different twist-boat

00:04:55.267 --> 00:04:56.089
forms.
 

00:04:56.089 --> 00:05:00.752
So we would say there are few
structures that are chair

00:05:00.752 --> 00:05:05.329
cyclohexane, but many structures
that are the boat.

00:05:05.329 --> 00:05:07.589
And furthermore,
if we look at it in terms of

00:05:07.589 --> 00:05:10.425
quantum mechanics,
which is the real way to do it,

00:05:10.425 --> 00:05:12.579
we notice that when there's a
steep,

00:05:12.579 --> 00:05:15.423
stiff valley,
there are very few energy

00:05:15.423 --> 00:05:17.446
levels that are accessible.
 

00:05:17.446 --> 00:05:18.120
Right?
 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.603
But if the barriers are low,
then there are many,

00:05:21.603 --> 00:05:23.199
many quantum levels.
 

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:26.526
So you count many more quantum
levels for the flexible form

00:05:26.526 --> 00:05:28.420
than you do for the chair form.
 

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:32.980
What that means is from,
whether the red classical view

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:37.004
or the green quantum view,
there's a big statistical

00:05:37.004 --> 00:05:40.908
factor, an entropy factor,
which turns out to be about

00:05:40.908 --> 00:05:44.629
7-fold favoring the twist-boat
over the chair.

00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:49.101
The chair is still favored;
it's favored because of energy,

00:05:49.101 --> 00:05:52.879
that Boltzmann factor,
e^ΔH/kT.

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:59.005
But this reduces that bias in
favor of the chair -- which

00:05:59.005 --> 00:06:03.930
would otherwise be 10^3/4ths of
5.5; right?

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:06.480
-- it reduces it by about a
factor of 2000.

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:10.420
So the equilibrium constant is
only 14,000 -- instead of

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:14.360
14,000, it reduces by a factor
of 7, to make it 2000.

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:19.238
Okay, so that's -- but so we've
been talking about entropy here

00:06:19.238 --> 00:06:21.050
in statistical terms.
 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:24.160
But remember earlier we talked
about the fact that physical

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.574
chemists actually measure
entropy as something

00:06:26.574 --> 00:06:29.297
experimental,
not just a counting exercise,

00:06:29.297 --> 00:06:32.752
and they do it beginning with
something that's as close as

00:06:32.752 --> 00:06:34.389
possible to zero Kelvin.
 

00:06:34.389 --> 00:06:37.641
Because if you have a perfectly
ordered crystal,

00:06:37.641 --> 00:06:40.824
at zero Kelvin,
then there's only one structure

00:06:40.824 --> 00:06:42.278
you're talking about.
 

00:06:42.278 --> 00:06:43.040
Right?
 

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:46.911
So the entropy is the log of
one, which is zero,

00:06:46.911 --> 00:06:49.877
or log of 1/R;
times R.

00:06:49.877 --> 00:06:50.620
Okay?
 

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:51.899
So it's zero.
 

00:06:51.899 --> 00:06:57.810
But then as you warm it up,
as you put heat in,

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:01.654
you measure the increase in
this thing called entropy by how

00:07:01.654 --> 00:07:04.136
much heat you put in,
at each temperature,

00:07:04.136 --> 00:07:04.870
as you warm up.
 

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:06.420
And we talked about that
already.

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:10.956
And you'll notice qualitatively
how this works is that floppy

00:07:10.956 --> 00:07:13.536
molecules,
like the flexible form of

00:07:13.536 --> 00:07:16.420
cyclohexane,
that have many closely spaced

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:18.834
energy levels,
absorb more energy,

00:07:18.834 --> 00:07:21.810
and they absorb it at lower
temperatures,

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:24.810
and thus they have more entropy
when they get warmed.

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:27.269
So whether you do it
experimentally,

00:07:27.269 --> 00:07:29.500
by measuring the heat that gets
absorbed,

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:32.529
or whether you measure it by
counting quantum states,

00:07:32.529 --> 00:07:35.163
you get the same result;
that a floppy molecule is

00:07:35.163 --> 00:07:36.779
favored in terms of entropy.
 

00:07:36.779 --> 00:07:39.642
We talked about that when we
were talking about the barrier

00:07:39.642 --> 00:07:40.680
to ethane rotation.
 

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:45.348
Okay, so we've looked at the
Boltzmann factor and this

00:07:45.348 --> 00:07:49.050
entropy factor,
that come from counting.

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:53.560
Notice that in the second case,
truly we should be counting not

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:57.625
structures but quantum states;
how many states are there that

00:07:57.625 --> 00:07:58.029
count?
 

00:07:58.029 --> 00:08:00.512
And if you want to be really,
really picky,

00:08:00.512 --> 00:08:03.350
you say the weighted number of
quantum states;

00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:06.091
because ones that are higher in
energy are not as populated as

00:08:06.091 --> 00:08:07.528
ones that are lower in energy.
 

00:08:07.528 --> 00:08:09.649
But we don't have to worry
about that now.

00:08:09.649 --> 00:08:11.600
At any rate,
those two factors,

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:14.627
taken together,
are what gives the equilibrium

00:08:14.627 --> 00:08:17.937
constant,
which as we said before is

00:08:17.937 --> 00:08:20.980
e^-ΔG,
free energy;

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:23.646
that means it's both enthalpy,
heat, and entropy,

00:08:23.646 --> 00:08:24.870
this counting thing.
 

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:27.550
But there's more to it than
that.

00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:31.038
There's also the statistics
involved in the Law of Mass

00:08:31.038 --> 00:08:31.620
Action.
 

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:35.840
And that comes from counting
molecules per volume;

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:37.908
that is, concentration.
 

00:08:37.908 --> 00:08:42.154
So you can count energy,
you can count quantum states,

00:08:42.154 --> 00:08:45.440
and you can count molecules per
volume.

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:50.889
This is very easily understood.
 

00:08:50.889 --> 00:08:54.379
The way it developed
experimentally is that in the

00:08:54.379 --> 00:08:58.441
late 1700s there was an attempt
to assemble a hierarchy of

00:08:58.441 --> 00:09:01.080
affinities;
that some elements had more

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:02.360
affinity than others.
 

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:05.220
So if you had a compound that
involved one element,

00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:08.940
and mixed it with an element
that had higher affinity,

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:11.544
that one with higher affinity
would take away molecules from

00:09:11.544 --> 00:09:12.870
the one with lower affinity.
 

00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:16.879
But then it was found,
in the early 1800s,

00:09:16.879 --> 00:09:20.350
that it doesn't always go in
that direction,

00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:24.110
because concentrations can
change and make things go the

00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:27.013
wrong way,
toward something that's a very

00:09:27.013 --> 00:09:29.327
low affinity,
if it has very high

00:09:29.327 --> 00:09:30.360
concentration.
 

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:33.964
And by the middle 1800s,
this was formulated as an

00:09:33.964 --> 00:09:37.753
equilibrium constant,
K, which was understood

00:09:37.753 --> 00:09:42.070
as the balance between forward
reactions and reverse reactions.

00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:47.710
You've seen that k_1/k_-1
is the equilibrium constant.

00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:52.448
So concentration comes into it,
in this thing called the Law of

00:09:52.448 --> 00:09:53.519
Mass Action.
 

00:09:53.519 --> 00:09:56.490
If you have two A's that can go
to A_2,

00:09:56.490 --> 00:09:58.168
then you have this equilibrium
constant,

00:09:58.168 --> 00:10:03.148
written as the concentration of
A_2 divided by the concentration

00:10:03.148 --> 00:10:03.860
of A^2.
 

00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:08.250
Now why the exponent?
 

00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:10.480
Where does that exponent two
come from?

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:12.080
And sometimes it's three.
 

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:12.720
Remember?
 

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:15.870
Again, it's statistical and
very, very easy to see.

00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:21.316
Here I used Excel to place a
bunch of circles randomly on a

00:10:21.316 --> 00:10:23.570
two-dimenstional plot.
 

00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:25.928
So it put 50 of these circles
down.

00:10:25.928 --> 00:10:29.500
And we're going to count as
dimers things where they

00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:32.090
overlap, where they touch one
another.

00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:32.720
Okay?
 

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:35.971
So there's -- if you have 50
particles, this particular

00:10:35.971 --> 00:10:38.558
realization of randomness gave
one dimer.

00:10:38.558 --> 00:10:42.158
But suppose we add another 50.
 

00:10:42.158 --> 00:10:43.000
Right?
 

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.581
Now, in addition to the
original dimer,

00:10:46.581 --> 00:10:48.184
there are 8 more.
 

00:10:48.184 --> 00:10:48.940
Okay?
 

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:53.480
And now suppose I add another
50, now there are 19 dimers.

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:56.440
Or another 50;
now there are 35 dimers.

00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:59.610
Or another 50,
and now there are 59 dimers.

00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:03.730
Now let's make a plot of how
many dimers there are,

00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:08.759
compared to how many particles
there are, undimerized ones.

00:11:08.759 --> 00:11:10.822
So there's the number of
particles and the number of

00:11:10.822 --> 00:11:12.200
dimers, plotted;
the data there.

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:13.889
And you see what it is.
 

00:11:13.889 --> 00:11:17.636
It's a parabola;
that the number of dimers is

00:11:17.636 --> 00:11:21.720
proportional to the square of
the number of monomers.

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:24.620
Now why should that be so?
 

00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:28.609
It's because as you increase
the concentration,

00:11:28.609 --> 00:11:33.120
you increase the number of
units there; obviously.

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:34.308
That's by definition.
 

00:11:34.308 --> 00:11:38.344
But you also increase the
fraction of the units that have

00:11:38.344 --> 00:11:41.009
a near neighbor,
that are touching.

00:11:41.009 --> 00:11:44.572
So not only do you increase the
number that could be dimers,

00:11:44.572 --> 00:11:47.230
you increase the fraction that
are dimers.

00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:51.076
So there are two ways in which
increasing the concentration

00:11:51.076 --> 00:11:52.403
increases the dimer.
 

00:11:52.403 --> 00:11:53.000
Right?
 

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.298
So it's a square.
 

00:11:54.298 --> 00:11:55.639
That's where the exponent comes
in.

00:11:55.639 --> 00:11:58.580
It's purely statistical,
for random distribution.

00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:01.392
And then, of course,
energy can enter in,

00:12:01.392 --> 00:12:03.009
entropy can enter in.
 

00:12:03.009 --> 00:12:04.480
That will change the K.
 

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:09.210
But the exponent on P --
right?

00:12:09.210 --> 00:12:13.110
-- is due just to this counting
procedure.

00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:16.184
So you increase both the number
and the fraction that are

00:12:16.184 --> 00:12:16.678
dimers.
 

00:12:16.678 --> 00:12:20.610
Okay, so now we know about
equilibrium, statistics and

00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:21.500
exponents.
 

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:25.580
We have particle distribution,
that's the law of mass action;

00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:27.340
that's that square we just
talked about.

00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:30.190
We have energy distribution,
ΔH,

00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:31.678
the Boltzmann factor.
 

00:12:31.678 --> 00:12:36.535
And we have counting of quantum
states, which has to do with

00:12:36.535 --> 00:12:37.360
entropy.
 

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:42.774
Okay, so free energy determines
what equilibrium is,

00:12:42.774 --> 00:12:44.474
what can happen.
 

00:12:44.474 --> 00:12:45.428
Right?
 

00:12:45.428 --> 00:12:48.943
And that ΔG
remember includes both entropy

00:12:48.943 --> 00:12:49.788
and energy.
 

00:12:49.788 --> 00:12:53.731
But it doesn't tell you at all
how quickly it will happen,

00:12:53.731 --> 00:12:56.500
what the kinetics of the
reaction are.

00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:59.932
So for that purpose we're going
to try visualizing reactions,

00:12:59.932 --> 00:13:03.250
to see if we can get a picture
of what determines rates.

00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:04.970
And we're going to look at two
kinds of things.

00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:08.269
We're going to look at
classical trajectories,

00:13:08.269 --> 00:13:11.936
and at the potential energy
surface, and collective

00:13:11.936 --> 00:13:12.889
concepts.
 

00:13:12.889 --> 00:13:17.009
So first let's start with the
potential energy surface.

00:13:17.009 --> 00:13:19.278
Here's a very simple potential
energy surface.

00:13:19.278 --> 00:13:20.840
It's just a two-dimensional
diagram.

00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:22.700
So you've seen it before.
 

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:24.979
We plot the distance between
two atoms, A-B,

00:13:24.979 --> 00:13:28.000
and the potential energy as a
function of the distance.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.918
So this is a Morse-type curve.
 

00:13:29.918 --> 00:13:35.759
Okay, so we put a ball on it,
and let that ball roll to map

00:13:35.759 --> 00:13:39.683
out different distances,
as it moves -- that's the

00:13:39.683 --> 00:13:42.412
horizontal axis --
and the energy corresponding to

00:13:42.412 --> 00:13:43.288
that distance.
 

00:13:43.288 --> 00:13:46.600
So it rolls back and forth --
right?

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:49.628
-- mapping out the change in
geometry horizontally,

00:13:49.628 --> 00:13:51.928
and the change in energy
vertically.

00:13:51.928 --> 00:13:55.481
Now we're going to look at a
three-dimensional surface,

00:13:55.481 --> 00:13:58.178
or actually two geometrical
dimensions;

00:13:58.178 --> 00:14:02.051
plus the third dimension coming
out at you, the contours,

00:14:02.051 --> 00:14:06.129
have to do with potential
energy, of three particles now.

00:14:06.129 --> 00:14:09.037
But in order to describe the
position of three particles,

00:14:09.037 --> 00:14:12.000
you need three distances;
one to two, two to three,

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.059
and three to one.
 

00:14:13.059 --> 00:14:13.558
Right?
 

00:14:13.558 --> 00:14:15.750
So that's too many dimensions
to plot this way.

00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:18.678
So we're going to assume that
they're all on a line.

00:14:18.678 --> 00:14:20.933
So we only have the distance
between one and two,

00:14:20.933 --> 00:14:22.860
and the distance between two
and three.

00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:27.469
So two coordinates will tell
you what the arrangement of

00:14:27.469 --> 00:14:31.155
those three atoms are,
if they're in just one

00:14:31.155 --> 00:14:32.330
dimension.
 

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:35.860
Okay, so a linear triatomic,
A-B-C.

00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:39.135
On the horizontal distance we
have the distance A to B,

00:14:39.135 --> 00:14:42.169
on the vertical axis,
B to C, and the contours tell

00:14:42.169 --> 00:14:44.945
us how low the energy is;
the darker, the lower the

00:14:44.945 --> 00:14:45.269
energy.
 

00:14:45.269 --> 00:14:49.870
Okay, so this specifies the
structure.

00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:53.934
So the position of a point
specifies not the position of an

00:14:53.934 --> 00:14:56.668
atom but the position of a set
of atoms.

00:14:56.668 --> 00:14:57.370
Right?
 

00:14:57.370 --> 00:15:00.510
So as we move one point around,
we're moving two atoms,

00:15:00.510 --> 00:15:02.139
or changing two distances.
 

00:15:02.139 --> 00:15:05.763
But we can denote it with one
point here, in two geometric

00:15:05.763 --> 00:15:06.590
dimensions.
 

00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:08.750
Okay, so let's look at several
regions.

00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:10.950
Let's look at that valley on
the right.

00:15:10.950 --> 00:15:13.110
What is that valley?
 

00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:17.230
When a point is in that valley,
what's it describing?

00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:22.625
It says that the distance
between A and B is large.

00:15:22.625 --> 00:15:23.490
Right?
 

00:15:23.490 --> 00:15:25.610
So A is far away from B.
 

00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:28.549
What does it say about the BC
distance?

00:15:28.549 --> 00:15:31.308
It's short.
 

00:15:31.308 --> 00:15:34.429
It's the normal distance for a
BC molecule.

00:15:34.429 --> 00:15:38.238
So what is it;
when a point is in that valley,

00:15:38.238 --> 00:15:40.230
what geometry is it describing?
 

00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:44.153
It's describing a BC molecule,
with an A atom at a great

00:15:44.153 --> 00:15:47.506
distance from it,
depending on how far out we go

00:15:47.506 --> 00:15:48.720
to the right.
 

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:50.440
Does everybody see that?
 

00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:54.832
One position of the point tells
us where both -- where all three

00:15:54.832 --> 00:15:57.552
atoms are, as long as they're on
a line.

00:15:57.552 --> 00:15:58.250
Right?
 

00:15:58.250 --> 00:16:00.889
Now how about up there,
on that plateau?

00:16:00.889 --> 00:16:03.129
What's happening there?
 

00:16:03.129 --> 00:16:05.000
What's the physical system?
 

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.100
Maria, what do you say?
 

00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:09.139
Student:  All the atoms
are separate from each other.

00:16:09.139 --> 00:16:10.508
Prof: Yeah,
the atoms are all separate from

00:16:10.508 --> 00:16:10.899
one another.
 

00:16:10.899 --> 00:16:15.028
C is far from B and A is far
from B.

00:16:15.028 --> 00:16:16.590
So there the atoms are
separated.

00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:17.820
And it's high in energy.
 

00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:20.409
You're not surprised that it
takes energy to pull them apart.

00:16:20.409 --> 00:16:24.298
And there is a cliff. Right?
 

00:16:24.298 --> 00:16:27.120
If this were a hiking map,
that would be a cliff.

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:28.340
What does that cliff mean?
 

00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:29.889
Why is there a cliff there?
 

00:16:29.889 --> 00:16:33.158
Greg, what do you say?
 

00:16:33.158 --> 00:16:37.418
Why is there a cliff shown
there?

00:16:37.418 --> 00:16:40.908
What's the geometry that points
in that region described?

00:16:40.908 --> 00:16:43.029
Student:  Closer
together.

00:16:43.029 --> 00:16:44.879
Prof: What's close
together?

00:16:44.879 --> 00:16:46.490
Is A close to B?
 

00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:47.960
Student:  Closer.
 

00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:49.586
Prof: Is A close to B?
 

00:16:49.586 --> 00:16:50.538
I couldn't hear.
 

00:16:50.538 --> 00:16:51.548
Student:  Closer maybe
to B.

00:16:51.548 --> 00:16:52.225
Prof: No.
 

00:16:52.225 --> 00:16:53.279
Here's the distance A-B.
 

00:16:53.279 --> 00:16:55.113
It's way out there,
where that cliff is.

00:16:55.113 --> 00:16:55.490
Right?
 

00:16:55.490 --> 00:16:56.549
So A's far away.
 

00:16:56.549 --> 00:16:57.720
But what's happening?
 

00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:01.769
B and C are getting very close
to one another.

00:17:01.769 --> 00:17:03.519
So that's a collision between B
and C;

00:17:03.519 --> 00:17:05.780
much shorter than their bond
distance.

00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:06.269
Right?
 

00:17:06.269 --> 00:17:08.080
They're being scrunched
together in that region,

00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:09.855
and that's why the energy goes
up very rapidly,

00:17:09.855 --> 00:17:11.589
because they're running into
one another;

00:17:11.589 --> 00:17:13.849
closer than they like to be.
 

00:17:13.849 --> 00:17:16.920
There's a ridge -- right?
 

00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:18.318
-- as you go down there.
 

00:17:18.318 --> 00:17:19.990
If you were hiking,
that would be a ridge.

00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:23.261
And there's a special point on
the ridge, which is marked by

00:17:23.261 --> 00:17:24.150
the red cross.
 

00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:26.230
What would you call that if you
were hiking?

00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:29.118
If you were in the valley
that's labeled yellow,

00:17:29.118 --> 00:17:31.028
and you were thinking of
getting to the other valley,

00:17:31.028 --> 00:17:34.559
what would you call that cross,
if you were hiking?

00:17:34.559 --> 00:17:35.640
Student:  A peak.
 

00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:39.769
Prof: Not a peak. Right?
 

00:17:39.769 --> 00:17:42.294
It comes -- it gets high as it
gets close to me here,

00:17:42.294 --> 00:17:44.140
and it gets high out on the
plateau.

00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:46.943
It's actually low,
as we go along the line,

00:17:46.943 --> 00:17:50.348
but it's high as we go
perpendicular to the line.

00:17:50.348 --> 00:17:52.109
What would you call that if you
were hiking?

00:17:52.109 --> 00:17:53.390
Some of you must hike.
 

00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:54.410
Student:  A pass.
 

00:17:54.410 --> 00:17:56.380
Prof: Pardon me?
 

00:17:56.380 --> 00:17:57.598
Student:  A pass.
 

00:17:57.598 --> 00:17:59.963
Prof: It's a pass,
between one valley and the

00:17:59.963 --> 00:18:00.660
other valley.
 

00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:03.538
That's the way you would go if
you were hiking -- right?

00:18:03.538 --> 00:18:04.680
-- so you don't have to climb
so high.

00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:07.259
Okay, so it's a pass.
 

00:18:07.259 --> 00:18:10.144
Or in chemistry we call it a
transition state,

00:18:10.144 --> 00:18:11.940
or a transition structure.
 

00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:14.858
And it's like a potato chip.
 

00:18:14.858 --> 00:18:15.588
Right?
 

00:18:15.588 --> 00:18:19.463
It's a minimum in one
direction, along the ridge,

00:18:19.463 --> 00:18:23.823
but it's a maximum in the path
between the two valleys.

00:18:23.823 --> 00:18:24.549
Okay?
 

00:18:24.549 --> 00:18:27.230
So it's a very special point.
 

00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:29.720
Okay, now let's look at this a
little closer.

00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:33.359
Suppose we sliced this surface,
we took a knife and sliced it

00:18:33.359 --> 00:18:35.874
along the red line there,
horizontally,

00:18:35.874 --> 00:18:39.259
and then folded it back to look
at the cross-section.

00:18:39.259 --> 00:18:40.730
Does everybody see what I'm
saying?

00:18:40.730 --> 00:18:42.828
What would the cross-section
look like?

00:18:42.828 --> 00:18:48.720
It's exactly that one we looked
at before.

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:54.253
So that involves stretching A
and B, with C so far away that

00:18:54.253 --> 00:18:55.755
it's irrelevant.
 

00:18:55.755 --> 00:18:56.598
Right?
 

00:18:56.598 --> 00:18:58.328
So it's just stretching a
diatomic molecule.

00:18:58.328 --> 00:19:02.425
Or if we sliced -- so that's
vibration of AB,

00:19:02.425 --> 00:19:06.150
with a distant spectator of
C.***Okay?

00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:08.710
Now suppose we sliced it that
way and pulled it back.

00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:10.078
Now what is it?
 

00:19:10.078 --> 00:19:16.540
It's a vibrating BC molecule,
with A far away.

00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:17.690
Right?
 

00:19:17.690 --> 00:19:20.744
So again, by choosing points on
this, we can describe any

00:19:20.744 --> 00:19:24.127
geometry of these three points
we want, as long as they're on a

00:19:24.127 --> 00:19:24.618
line.
 

00:19:24.618 --> 00:19:26.578
But a single point is a whole
structure.

00:19:26.578 --> 00:19:33.578
Okay, now let's look at a
trajectory.

00:19:33.578 --> 00:19:36.684
We roll a ball on this surface,
and it rolls up toward the pass

00:19:36.684 --> 00:19:39.038
but doesn't make it and comes
back like that.

00:19:39.038 --> 00:19:42.410
So that's a trajectory that was
unreactive;

00:19:42.410 --> 00:19:46.027
it didn't make it into the
product valley,

00:19:46.027 --> 00:19:48.940
it didn't get across the ridge.
 

00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:53.808
And physically what it means is
that A gets closer to BC.

00:19:53.808 --> 00:19:56.432
While BC is vibrating,
it's moving up and down.

00:19:56.432 --> 00:19:56.890
Right?
 

00:19:56.890 --> 00:19:58.509
So BC is vibrating.
 

00:19:58.509 --> 00:20:02.547
A comes in and then bounces off
again.

00:20:02.547 --> 00:20:03.420
Right?
 

00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:08.643
So it was an unsuccessful
attempt of A to take B away from

00:20:08.643 --> 00:20:09.009
C.
 

00:20:09.009 --> 00:20:11.588
Or suppose we do this one.
 

00:20:11.588 --> 00:20:16.996
A approaches,
and now C flies away from

00:20:16.996 --> 00:20:19.130
vibrating AB.
 

00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:21.200
Does everybody see that?
 

00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:23.920
You want me to say it again?
 

00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:24.598
Right?
 

00:20:24.598 --> 00:20:27.420
So as it comes along,
B and C are standing still.

00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:28.740
It's not moving vertically,
right?

00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:31.654
So B and C are at their normal
distance, their standard

00:20:31.654 --> 00:20:32.250
distance.
 

00:20:32.250 --> 00:20:35.676
A comes in, whops into it,
gets really close,

00:20:35.676 --> 00:20:38.714
runs into that cliff,
really close to B,

00:20:38.714 --> 00:20:41.053
because it's the distance A-B.
 

00:20:41.053 --> 00:20:41.910
Right?
 

00:20:41.910 --> 00:20:46.314
And then it starts -- AB is
vibrating, and C is getting far

00:20:46.314 --> 00:20:49.578
away, as it goes down the
product valley.

00:20:49.578 --> 00:20:53.440
So that's a reactive
trajectory, where the first

00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:55.740
trajectory was unreactive.
 

00:20:55.740 --> 00:21:01.644
Notice that this is classical,
rolling a marble on the thing,

00:21:01.644 --> 00:21:06.269
because A was approaching a
non-vibrating BC.

00:21:06.269 --> 00:21:10.000
We know from quantum mechanics
that BC can't just sit there.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.019
BC vibrates.
 

00:21:11.019 --> 00:21:14.682
So that's not a realistic
trajectory, it's a classical

00:21:14.682 --> 00:21:17.380
model of a quantum mechanical
system.

00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:24.298
Now people have made surfaces
like that for real systems,

00:21:24.298 --> 00:21:27.924
like H_3, one hydrogen atom
attacking a hydrogen molecule

00:21:27.924 --> 00:21:30.450
and taking one of the hydrogens
away.

00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:31.170
Here it is.
 

00:21:31.170 --> 00:21:31.930
This was drawn.
 

00:21:31.930 --> 00:21:35.525
This is the first surface that
was drawn, that I know of,

00:21:35.525 --> 00:21:38.029
by Henry Eyring at Princeton in
1935.

00:21:38.029 --> 00:21:41.230
And it had some -- it has crazy
angles.

00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:44.662
And the reason it has that
angle is so that a marble

00:21:44.662 --> 00:21:48.431
rolling on it will behave
according to the way the masses

00:21:48.431 --> 00:21:51.660
of the thing --
so that the kinetics,

00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:54.440
the kinematics,
are exactly right,

00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:58.038
so that it really does do the
proper classical thing.

00:21:58.038 --> 00:22:03.171
If you roll a marble on here,
it will trace Newton's Laws of

00:22:03.171 --> 00:22:05.778
Motion, for this H_3 system.
 

00:22:05.778 --> 00:22:08.971
One thing that's unrealistic
about it is that there's a

00:22:08.971 --> 00:22:11.099
minimum near the transition
state.

00:22:11.099 --> 00:22:12.460
There's a little lake up there.
 

00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:15.472
That's just an artifact that
came from the equation he used

00:22:15.472 --> 00:22:16.980
to approximate the surface.
 

00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:17.868
It's not real.
 

00:22:17.868 --> 00:22:21.509
There actually is a potato
chip, not a lake up there at the

00:22:21.509 --> 00:22:21.950
pass.
 

00:22:21.950 --> 00:22:24.804
Some people have called it Lake
Eyring.

00:22:24.804 --> 00:22:25.328
Okay?
 

00:22:25.328 --> 00:22:30.363
But here's a more complicated
surface that was -- it says it

00:22:30.363 --> 00:22:33.519
was done by C. Parr,
in his Ph.D.

00:22:33.519 --> 00:22:36.109
thesis at Caltech in 1969.
 

00:22:36.109 --> 00:22:39.732
This is for H-H-Br;
again linear,

00:22:39.732 --> 00:22:44.140
but a hydrogen atom attacking
HBr to take away it's hydrogen.

00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:48.810
And this describes the
construction of a model based on

00:22:48.810 --> 00:22:52.271
that surface,
an actual physical model on

00:22:52.271 --> 00:22:54.607
which you can roll marbles.
 

00:22:54.607 --> 00:22:55.558
Right?
 

00:22:55.558 --> 00:22:57.646
So here it is,
and the dimensions,

00:22:57.646 --> 00:23:01.064
that one inch corresponds to
1.4 inches is an angstrom,

00:23:01.064 --> 00:23:01.950
and so on.
 

00:23:01.950 --> 00:23:05.548
So they actually constructed
physical models to do this.

00:23:05.548 --> 00:23:08.951
And, as it happens,
we have that physical model

00:23:08.951 --> 00:23:09.470
here.
 

00:23:09.470 --> 00:23:18.328
Here, this is it.
 

00:23:18.328 --> 00:23:22.799
&lt;&lt;Technical
adjustment&gt;&gt;

00:23:22.799 --> 00:23:25.660
Okay, and we have some marbles.
 

00:23:25.660 --> 00:23:28.588
So notice what's different
about this one.

00:23:28.588 --> 00:23:30.039
I'll hold it up so you can see
it.

00:23:30.039 --> 00:23:33.108
There's the surface. Right?
 

00:23:33.108 --> 00:23:35.353
And here's a slice through one.
 

00:23:35.353 --> 00:23:35.858
Right?
 

00:23:35.858 --> 00:23:43.009
That's H_2 with -- this valley
is H_2 with a Br atom.

00:23:43.009 --> 00:23:46.635
This valley is HBr,
with an H atom.

00:23:46.635 --> 00:23:47.490
Right?
 

00:23:47.490 --> 00:23:51.039
So we can try rolling balls and
see what happens here.

00:23:51.039 --> 00:23:56.089
So here I am far away.
 

00:23:56.089 --> 00:23:58.500
The H atom is far away from HBr.
 

00:23:58.500 --> 00:23:59.680
And I do that.
 

00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:03.173
And it's vibrating,
but it doesn't succeed.

00:24:03.173 --> 00:24:03.839
Right?
 

00:24:03.839 --> 00:24:04.848
I can do it a little bit more.
 

00:24:04.848 --> 00:24:09.700
And most reactions aren't
successful.

00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:16.470
Oh close. Okay?
 

00:24:16.470 --> 00:24:19.553
And as it comes out,
it may be vibrating when it

00:24:19.553 --> 00:24:23.490
comes out, or it may not be
vibrating when it comes -- oh.

00:24:23.490 --> 00:24:25.190
What's the cross?
 

00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:30.210
The cross is that transition
structure -- right?

00:24:30.210 --> 00:24:31.769
-- or the transition state.
 

00:24:37.390 --> 00:24:37.866
Right?
 

00:24:37.866 --> 00:24:41.288
So you could do every possible
trajectory.

00:24:41.288 --> 00:24:44.615
You could have different
velocities at which A is

00:24:44.615 --> 00:24:47.904
colliding with BC,
and you can have different

00:24:47.904 --> 00:24:51.030
amounts of vibration,
and different phases of

00:24:51.030 --> 00:24:51.750
vibration.
 

00:24:51.750 --> 00:24:54.826
I could start it going this
way, or I could start it going

00:24:54.826 --> 00:24:55.420
this way.
 

00:24:55.420 --> 00:24:59.194
And if I did every possible one
of those, then I could average

00:24:59.194 --> 00:25:02.910
over all them and see how many
of them succeeded -- right?

00:25:02.910 --> 00:25:04.220
-- in reaction.
 

00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:06.928
And that would allow me to
predict the rate of this

00:25:06.928 --> 00:25:07.470
process.
 

00:25:07.470 --> 00:25:09.490
&lt;&lt;Technical
adjustment&gt;&gt;

00:25:09.490 --> 00:25:12.410
Okay, so people have done that
kind of thing.

00:25:12.410 --> 00:25:17.443
But studying lots of random
trajectories provides too much

00:25:17.443 --> 00:25:18.240
detail.
 

00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:22.900
No one really cares about all
those individual trajectories.

00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:27.480
What you care about is what
fraction succeed.

00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:30.623
And if you could do that in a
simpler way than rolling it a

00:25:30.623 --> 00:25:33.605
zillion times and averaging,
then that would be a better

00:25:33.605 --> 00:25:34.308
approach.
 

00:25:34.308 --> 00:25:38.750
So it's better to summarize
this thing statistically using

00:25:38.750 --> 00:25:42.088
collective terms;
not individual paths but

00:25:42.088 --> 00:25:45.809
collective terms,
such as enthalpy and entropy.

00:25:45.809 --> 00:25:47.680
And you can do it in this way.
 

00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:53.240
Okay, you have a steepest
descent path from the pass.

00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:57.272
Suppose you slice this surface
with a knife perpendicular to

00:25:57.272 --> 00:25:59.148
the screen,
along that path,

00:25:59.148 --> 00:26:01.390
and then fold it out to make it
flat,

00:26:01.390 --> 00:26:04.140
and look at the cross-section
of it.

00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:07.180
Okay, and now we'll tip it up
and it looks like that.

00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:10.390
Does everybody see how it looks
like that?

00:26:10.390 --> 00:26:13.410
Okay, we sliced along the path
that goes up over the transition

00:26:13.410 --> 00:26:13.798
state.
 

00:26:13.798 --> 00:26:16.905
Okay, so we have potential
energy as a function of distance

00:26:16.905 --> 00:26:18.618
along the reaction coordinate.
 

00:26:18.618 --> 00:26:21.756
But of course we're going to
summarize a whole bunch of

00:26:21.756 --> 00:26:22.568
things here.
 

00:26:22.568 --> 00:26:26.122
Nothing rolls exactly along
that path.

00:26:26.122 --> 00:26:26.890
Right?
 

00:26:26.890 --> 00:26:30.556
So we're going to lose some of
the specificity of the reaction

00:26:30.556 --> 00:26:32.480
coordinate by grouping things.
 

00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:36.144
We're not going to take a
trajectory, but a sequence of

00:26:36.144 --> 00:26:37.230
three species.
 

00:26:37.230 --> 00:26:40.259
The first species is the
starting material;

00:26:40.259 --> 00:26:43.250
the second species is the
transition state;

00:26:43.250 --> 00:26:46.250
and the third species is the
product.

00:26:46.250 --> 00:26:49.720
And now instead of having an
explicit meaning for every

00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:52.930
geometry along that path,
what we're going to do is

00:26:52.930 --> 00:26:55.470
associate each of those starting
materials,

00:26:55.470 --> 00:26:59.407
transition state and products,
with a certain enthalpy and a

00:26:59.407 --> 00:27:03.220
certain entropy;
that is, a certain free energy.

00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:05.843
So we have -- instead we're
going to plot free energy

00:27:05.843 --> 00:27:09.258
vertically,
incorporate entropy -- that is,

00:27:09.258 --> 00:27:14.663
how loose these things are --
as well as enthalpy there;

00:27:14.663 --> 00:27:15.519
energy.
 

00:27:15.519 --> 00:27:17.750
And now we just have three
values of free energy:

00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:19.750
the free energy of the starting
material;

00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:21.269
the free energy of the
transition state;

00:27:21.269 --> 00:27:22.778
the free energy of the product.
 

00:27:22.778 --> 00:27:27.125
And now we can use those -- but
we've lost a lot of specificity

00:27:27.125 --> 00:27:29.720
in what the reaction coordinate
is.

00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:31.880
It's just a sequence now of
three species.

00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:36.130
But we can now use free energy
to determine what can happen.

00:27:36.130 --> 00:27:37.480
We already could do that.
 

00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:39.048
But how rapidly?
 

00:27:39.048 --> 00:27:43.512
And you do that with the theory
that Eyring made up when he drew

00:27:43.512 --> 00:27:47.410
that surface in 1935,
called Transition State Theory.

00:27:47.410 --> 00:27:51.317
You assume that the rate
constant -- and we talked about

00:27:51.317 --> 00:27:54.730
this before -- in units per
second is 10^13th.

00:27:54.730 --> 00:27:57.484
So things happen
10^13th/second,

00:27:57.484 --> 00:28:01.930
times the concentration of the
transition state.

00:28:01.930 --> 00:28:06.009
So the idea is that things that
are in the transition state are

00:28:06.009 --> 00:28:08.380
moving at the rate
10^13th/second.

00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:10.567
So if you know how many are at
the transition state,

00:28:10.567 --> 00:28:12.538
then you know how many are
going to product;

00:28:12.538 --> 00:28:14.845
10^13th times that,
per second.

00:28:14.845 --> 00:28:15.460
Right?
 

00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:17.049
And you know how to do an
equilibrium;

00:28:17.049 --> 00:28:18.019
we already do that.
 

00:28:18.019 --> 00:28:20.509
All we do is use that special
double dagger,

00:28:20.509 --> 00:28:25.416
to mean the difference in
energy going from the starting

00:28:25.416 --> 00:28:28.630
material to the transition
state,

00:28:28.630 --> 00:28:30.328
the difference in free energy.
 

00:28:30.328 --> 00:28:32.480
Now we can calculate that
equilibrium constant.

00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:34.619
We know how much starting
material there is;

00:28:34.619 --> 00:28:35.940
the Law of Mass Action.
 

00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:38.920
We know how much transition
state there is in equilibrium

00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:40.410
with that starting material.
 

00:28:40.410 --> 00:28:40.890
Right?
 

00:28:40.890 --> 00:28:44.786
So that e^-ΔG/RT
is the equilibrium constant for

00:28:44.786 --> 00:28:47.622
getting the transition state;
multiply it by the

00:28:47.622 --> 00:28:49.450
concentration of the starting
material.

00:28:49.450 --> 00:28:51.650
You have the concentration of
the transition state.

00:28:51.650 --> 00:28:55.554
Multiply it by 10^13th,
and you know how fast it's

00:28:55.554 --> 00:28:56.031
going.
 

00:28:56.031 --> 00:28:56.750
Right?
 

00:28:56.750 --> 00:28:59.848
So it assumes that there's a
universal rate constant for

00:28:59.848 --> 00:29:02.160
transition states going to the
product;

00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:04.108
10^13th/second.
 

00:29:04.108 --> 00:29:05.920
That's about how fast things
vibrate.

00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:09.818
So things won't stay on the
potato chip, they'll roll off,

00:29:09.818 --> 00:29:13.650
and the rate at which they roll
off is 10^13th/second.

00:29:13.650 --> 00:29:16.561
This is, of course,
an approximation.

00:29:16.561 --> 00:29:18.098
It isn't correct.
 

00:29:18.098 --> 00:29:20.730
Because there's not true
equilibrium between the

00:29:20.730 --> 00:29:23.250
transition state and the
starting material.

00:29:23.250 --> 00:29:26.688
For true equilibrium the same
number must be going in and out.

00:29:26.688 --> 00:29:27.140
Right?
 

00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:28.797
But when things get to the
transition state,

00:29:28.797 --> 00:29:30.568
often they keep going,
they don't come back.

00:29:30.568 --> 00:29:33.462
So it's not really a rigorous
theory, but it's a very,

00:29:33.462 --> 00:29:36.029
very helpful theory for
approximate purposes.

00:29:36.029 --> 00:29:39.949
And that's what I say here.
 

00:29:39.949 --> 00:29:40.818
Okay?
 

00:29:40.818 --> 00:29:43.810
So using energies to predict
equilibria and rates for

00:29:43.810 --> 00:29:46.720
one-step reactions;
free radical halogenations.

00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:48.820
And let me look,
we do have time to go through

00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:50.828
this stuff, I think;
at least most of it.

00:29:50.828 --> 00:29:54.520
We've already seen this,
that you break a chlorine

00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:56.480
molecule into two atoms.
 

00:29:56.480 --> 00:30:00.150
Then you do single electron
curved arrows;

00:30:00.150 --> 00:30:02.450
take the hydrogen away from
methyl --

00:30:02.450 --> 00:30:04.358
from methane,
to give methyl,

00:30:04.358 --> 00:30:08.229
and then it attacks chlorine --
we've seen this before -- and

00:30:08.229 --> 00:30:11.522
the chlorine atom comes back to
constitute a chain reaction.

00:30:11.522 --> 00:30:11.970
Okay?
 

00:30:11.970 --> 00:30:15.308
So it's catalytic in radicals.
 

00:30:15.308 --> 00:30:19.538
Okay, now we break and make
bonds in this.

00:30:19.538 --> 00:30:23.833
So we've already seen average
bond energies that might tell us

00:30:23.833 --> 00:30:26.788
how hard it is to break a bond
-- right?

00:30:26.788 --> 00:30:29.368
-- if that's what we have to do
to get to the transition state.

00:30:29.368 --> 00:30:31.470
So we may be on the way to
getting rates.

00:30:31.470 --> 00:30:34.930
But are these average bond
energies real bond energies,

00:30:34.930 --> 00:30:39.108
or are they just a trick for
reckoning the enthalpy,

00:30:39.108 --> 00:30:41.568
the total energy,
the heat of formation or

00:30:41.568 --> 00:30:43.700
whatever,
of a particular molecule?

00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:46.686
And we talked about this before
and saw that mostly it is a

00:30:46.686 --> 00:30:48.865
trick;
that individual bond energies

00:30:48.865 --> 00:30:49.291
change.
 

00:30:49.291 --> 00:30:49.779
Right?
 

00:30:49.779 --> 00:30:52.430
So average bond energies are
not what you want to use for

00:30:52.430 --> 00:30:54.509
this purpose;
although they might be in the

00:30:54.509 --> 00:30:57.109
ballpark of the right numbers,
but they're not the right

00:30:57.109 --> 00:30:57.630
numbers.
 

00:30:57.630 --> 00:31:01.660
What you really need are bond
dissociation energies;

00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:04.940
the actual energy it takes to
break a specific bond.

00:31:04.940 --> 00:31:08.201
And we've talked about how you
could get that from

00:31:08.201 --> 00:31:09.200
spectroscopy.
 

00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:10.618
Those are real.
 

00:31:10.618 --> 00:31:13.481
The average bond energies are
just a way of calculating

00:31:13.481 --> 00:31:14.490
molecular energy.
 

00:31:14.490 --> 00:31:19.145
So Appendix II of the
Streitwieser and Heathcock book

00:31:19.145 --> 00:31:24.338
shows various specific bonds
between the groups in column A

00:31:24.338 --> 00:31:28.279
and the atoms or groups in row A
there,

00:31:28.279 --> 00:31:29.490
in the top row.
 

00:31:29.490 --> 00:31:33.288
And those were the best values
when that book was published;

00:31:33.288 --> 00:31:37.355
the best values as of 2003 are
a little bit changed from that,

00:31:37.355 --> 00:31:41.287
and were tabulated by Barney
Ellison, whose picture I showed

00:31:41.287 --> 00:31:43.220
you the time before last.
 

00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:46.365
So here's a table from Blanksby
and Ellison, that shows a bunch

00:31:46.365 --> 00:31:48.650
of these things and how well
they're known.

00:31:48.650 --> 00:31:52.766
The H_2 bond dissociation
energy is 104.206,

00:31:52.766 --> 00:31:56.500
plus or minus 0.003
kilocalories/mol.

00:31:56.500 --> 00:31:57.650
So it's very well-known.
 

00:31:57.650 --> 00:31:59.478
So some of them are very,
very well-known,

00:31:59.478 --> 00:32:01.619
and some of them are known only
approximately.

00:32:01.619 --> 00:32:03.369
Let's look at a few of them.
 

00:32:03.369 --> 00:32:07.730
So H_2 104.2;
HF 136;

00:32:07.730 --> 00:32:10.839
HCl 103;
HBr 87;

00:32:10.839 --> 00:32:12.440
HI 71.
 

00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:15.490
So as you go down the halogens,
the bonds get weaker and

00:32:15.490 --> 00:32:15.990
weaker.
 

00:32:15.990 --> 00:32:17.588
Why should that be?
 

00:32:17.588 --> 00:32:20.640
Why do larger halogens give
weaker bonds?

00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:23.484
It's because they have poorer
overlap with hydrogen,

00:32:23.484 --> 00:32:26.609
at normal bond distances,
because their orbitals are very

00:32:26.609 --> 00:32:29.063
diffuse;
they don't have high numbers in

00:32:29.063 --> 00:32:31.019
the region where the hydrogen
is.

00:32:31.019 --> 00:32:36.288
And you have the energy match
also is unfavorable.

00:32:36.288 --> 00:32:39.590
So if you have HF,
with good overlap and a very

00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:42.750
low F, then you get lots of
stabilization;

00:32:42.750 --> 00:32:46.538
the sum or those two red arrows
is big, a strong bond.

00:32:46.538 --> 00:32:50.982
And if it's HI,
the overlap isn't so good,

00:32:50.982 --> 00:32:54.558
and the energy match is better.
 

00:32:54.558 --> 00:32:58.275
But still the amount by which
the electrons go down is not as

00:32:58.275 --> 00:32:59.390
much as with HF.
 

00:32:59.390 --> 00:33:02.358
So we can see qualitatively why
that is.

00:33:02.358 --> 00:33:06.430
So less electron stabilization
means a weaker bond.

00:33:06.430 --> 00:33:09.500
And we're going to talk about
this more next semester.

00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:11.278
This is just to give you a
flavor of it.

00:33:11.278 --> 00:33:15.272
And here, in Table II,
we see there's the same trend

00:33:15.272 --> 00:33:20.885
in bonding with methyl groups;
that the fluorine-methyl bond

00:33:20.885 --> 00:33:25.920
is 115, but the iodine-methyl
bond is only 58.

00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:29.803
But if you go across hydrogen
with the different alkyls --

00:33:29.803 --> 00:33:32.664
methyl, ethyl,
isopropyl, t-butyl --

00:33:32.664 --> 00:33:36.140
they're all very close to 100
kilocalories/mol.

00:33:36.140 --> 00:33:38.285
But not the same,
and that will turn out to make

00:33:38.285 --> 00:33:41.241
a difference;
as we'll see early next

00:33:41.241 --> 00:33:42.230
semester.
 

00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:44.999
And if you look at some of the
other kinds of radicals,

00:33:44.999 --> 00:33:46.640
you see there are differences.
 

00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:50.337
There are special cases for
vinyl, allyl -- remember allyl

00:33:50.337 --> 00:33:52.348
alcohol -- phenyl and benzyl.
 

00:33:52.348 --> 00:33:56.210
And I'll show you just a little
bit about that.

00:33:56.210 --> 00:34:01.317
Are these unusual bond
dissociation energy values due

00:34:01.317 --> 00:34:05.150
to unusual bonds or unusual
radicals?

00:34:05.150 --> 00:34:08.530
That is, standard we have:
here's a starting material;

00:34:08.530 --> 00:34:11.059
here's the bond;
here's the product as the

00:34:11.059 --> 00:34:14.000
bond's broken -- for making the
radicals.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:18.938
So we can get a strong bond,
either by lowering -- by making

00:34:18.938 --> 00:34:23.039
the bond strong,
or by making the radicals bad;

00:34:23.039 --> 00:34:26.112
either way increases the
barrier.

00:34:26.112 --> 00:34:26.880
Right?
 

00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:30.481
Similarly we can make a small
one, either by making the bond

00:34:30.481 --> 00:34:32.679
weak or making the radical
stable.

00:34:32.679 --> 00:34:35.449
Is this something that it's
meaningful to talk about?

00:34:35.449 --> 00:34:37.690
Well let's look at it in the
case of these special cases.

00:34:37.690 --> 00:34:41.579
So vinyl, you see,
is 110 kilocalories/mol.

00:34:41.579 --> 00:34:44.389
It's the bond to H.
 

00:34:44.389 --> 00:34:46.579
So it's a very strong bond. Why?
 

00:34:46.579 --> 00:34:49.559
Is there something special
about the vinyl radical?

00:34:49.559 --> 00:34:51.539
There's no special
stabilization.

00:34:51.539 --> 00:34:54.940
There's no overlap between that
singly occupied orbital,

00:34:54.940 --> 00:34:56.159
which is a σ
orbital,

00:34:56.159 --> 00:34:58.409
and the double bond,
which is a π orbital.

00:34:58.409 --> 00:35:00.760
There's nothing especially
stable about the vinyl radical.

00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:03.992
But if you look at the bond in
the starting material,

00:35:03.992 --> 00:35:05.670
the C-H bond,
it has sp^2

00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:07.909
hybridization of the carbon.
 

00:35:07.909 --> 00:35:10.050
So that one's a strong bond.
 

00:35:10.050 --> 00:35:13.177
That one's hard to break,
because the bond is unusually

00:35:13.177 --> 00:35:15.684
strong;
not because the radicals are

00:35:15.684 --> 00:35:17.032
unusually unstable.
 

00:35:17.032 --> 00:35:17.530
Okay?
 

00:35:17.530 --> 00:35:21.579
Or if you look at phenyl,
it's the same deal.

00:35:21.579 --> 00:35:25.190
You have a σ SOMO
and the π bonds,

00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:28.884
the low LUMOs that might
stabilize that singly occupied

00:35:28.884 --> 00:35:32.273
orbital's electron,
are perpendicular or orthogonal

00:35:32.273 --> 00:35:32.699
to it.
 

00:35:32.699 --> 00:35:34.739
So again it's hard to break
that bond.

00:35:34.739 --> 00:35:37.657
On the other hand,
the allyl -- and remember allyl

00:35:37.657 --> 00:35:41.170
alcohol we were talking about --
here's an allyl radical.

00:35:41.170 --> 00:35:45.018
Now there's overlap,
π overlap between the

00:35:45.018 --> 00:35:48.639
SOMO and the π* and
the π.

00:35:48.639 --> 00:35:51.400
It turns out -- and we'll talk
about this more next time --

00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:55.362
that when you mix those two,
the π* on the right

00:35:55.362 --> 00:35:58.829
and the SOMO in the middle,
you get stabilization.

00:35:58.829 --> 00:36:02.351
You get the same stabilization
by mixing the π with

00:36:02.351 --> 00:36:05.344
the SOMO, and if you mix both of
them with the SOMO,

00:36:05.344 --> 00:36:06.929
you get that structure.
 

00:36:06.929 --> 00:36:08.230
But this isn't the time to talk
about that.

00:36:08.230 --> 00:36:11.465
But at any rate,
the normal, the starting bond,

00:36:11.465 --> 00:36:12.309
is normal.
 

00:36:12.309 --> 00:36:15.199
It's an sp^3 C-H bond,
a normal bond.

00:36:15.199 --> 00:36:18.250
But in this case the radical is
unusually stable.

00:36:18.250 --> 00:36:22.655
So it's easy to break that one;
10 kilocalories easier than for

00:36:22.655 --> 00:36:24.030
normal C-H bonds.
 

00:36:24.030 --> 00:36:25.690
And the same for benzyl.
 

00:36:25.690 --> 00:36:31.289
Okay, now possibility of doing
a halogenation.

00:36:31.289 --> 00:36:34.132
Let's look first from the point
of view of the equilibrium

00:36:34.132 --> 00:36:36.425
constant from this,
at the difference in energy

00:36:36.425 --> 00:36:38.518
between starting material and
product.

00:36:38.518 --> 00:36:41.605
So we look at what bonds are
broken, and what bonds are

00:36:41.605 --> 00:36:42.119
formed.
 

00:36:42.119 --> 00:36:45.429
The red bonds are broken,
the green bonds are formed.

00:36:45.429 --> 00:36:48.626
So there'll be a cost for
breaking the red bonds and

00:36:48.626 --> 00:36:51.760
there'll be a return for making
the green bonds.

00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:53.239
And let's see how big it is.
 

00:36:53.239 --> 00:36:55.780
Okay, we're going to do it for
fluorine, chlorine,

00:36:55.780 --> 00:36:56.869
bromine and iodine.
 

00:36:56.869 --> 00:37:00.186
Okay, in every case we're
breaking a C-H bond,

00:37:00.186 --> 00:37:03.206
105 kilocalories/mol,
and we're breaking a

00:37:03.206 --> 00:37:05.050
halogen-halogen bond.
 

00:37:05.050 --> 00:37:07.179
But those are different,
for the different halogens;

00:37:07.179 --> 00:37:09.610
although interestingly not
monotonic.

00:37:09.610 --> 00:37:13.320
It's not a smooth progression,
it goes up and then down again.

00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:16.518
And the cost is the sum of
those two;

00:37:16.518 --> 00:37:18.389
what it's going to cost to
break those bonds.

00:37:18.389 --> 00:37:19.449
How about making bonds?
 

00:37:19.449 --> 00:37:23.090
We're going to make the C-X
bond and we're going to make the

00:37:23.090 --> 00:37:23.769
H-X bond.
 

00:37:23.769 --> 00:37:26.190
So the returns will be that.
 

00:37:26.190 --> 00:37:29.190
And now we see whether we can
make a living doing this.

00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:31.349
What will the profit be? Right?
 

00:37:31.349 --> 00:37:35.327
So in the case of fluorine,
251 is much greater than the

00:37:35.327 --> 00:37:36.340
cost of 142.
 

00:37:36.340 --> 00:37:40.014
So it's a big -- it's really
exothermic.

00:37:40.014 --> 00:37:40.769
Right?
 

00:37:40.769 --> 00:37:42.650
Chlorine, it's only 19.
 

00:37:42.650 --> 00:37:45.583
Bromine is only 9,
and iodine is

00:37:45.583 --> 00:37:47.949
minus 12.
 

00:37:47.949 --> 00:37:49.780
What does that mean?
 

00:37:49.780 --> 00:37:52.920
It means you can't do this
reaction with iodine.

00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:54.820
The equilibrium lies is in the
wrong direction.

00:37:54.820 --> 00:37:59.871
Okay, so already the
equilibrium constant and how

00:37:59.871 --> 00:38:06.293
energy relates to it tells you
that something is impossible to

00:38:06.293 --> 00:38:07.030
do.
 

00:38:07.030 --> 00:38:08.610
But the others seem to be
possible.

00:38:08.610 --> 00:38:10.960
But will they happen?
 

00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:12.360
How fast will they be?
 

00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:15.237
Do you have to wait until the
end of the universe in order for

00:38:15.237 --> 00:38:16.039
this to happen?
 

00:38:16.039 --> 00:38:20.280
Well let's look at how the
rate, which will depend on the

00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:21.190
mechanism.
 

00:38:21.190 --> 00:38:23.460
The equilibrium constant
doesn't depend on the path.

00:38:23.460 --> 00:38:26.351
It's just how high the starting
material is and how high the

00:38:26.351 --> 00:38:26.989
product is.
 

00:38:26.989 --> 00:38:30.418
But how fast you get depends on
the barriers you have to go

00:38:30.418 --> 00:38:30.949
across.
 

00:38:30.949 --> 00:38:35.168
So let's suppose -- let's just
try breaking two bonds,

00:38:35.168 --> 00:38:38.353
changing partners,
and forming two bonds.

00:38:38.353 --> 00:38:39.070
Okay?
 

00:38:39.070 --> 00:38:42.407
Then we have to -- to get to
the barrier, we have to break

00:38:42.407 --> 00:38:43.110
two bonds.
 

00:38:43.110 --> 00:38:45.367
So that cost -- we're going to
have to spend,

00:38:45.367 --> 00:38:47.059
in order to get to the barrier.
 

00:38:47.059 --> 00:38:48.750
So is this a plausible
mechanism?

00:38:48.750 --> 00:38:52.650
How fast would the reaction be,
if we used that mechanism?

00:38:52.650 --> 00:38:56.228
Well at room temperature,
say 300 Kelvin,

00:38:56.228 --> 00:39:00.969
then it's 10^3/4ths of how high
it is to get there;

00:39:00.969 --> 00:39:02.449
then times 10^13th/second.
 

00:39:02.449 --> 00:39:11.043
But notice that 10^13th times
10^-106, which is 3/4ths of 142,

00:39:11.043 --> 00:39:13.719
is 10^-93/second.
 

00:39:13.719 --> 00:39:17.369
10^93^( )seconds is a long,
long time.

00:39:17.369 --> 00:39:20.068
I don't know how old the
universe is, but I suspect

00:39:20.068 --> 00:39:20.824
that's longer.
 

00:39:20.824 --> 00:39:21.309
Right?
 

00:39:21.309 --> 00:39:22.730
So what about this mechanism?
 

00:39:22.730 --> 00:39:23.929
Plausible?
 

00:39:23.929 --> 00:39:24.980
Implausible?
 

00:39:24.980 --> 00:39:26.269
How could you make it happen?
 

00:39:26.269 --> 00:39:28.980
Shai?
 

00:39:28.980 --> 00:39:30.130
Student:  Change the
temperature.

00:39:30.130 --> 00:39:30.469
Prof: Pardon me?
 

00:39:30.469 --> 00:39:30.940
Student:  Change the
temperature.

00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:31.829
Prof: Change the
temperature;

00:39:31.829 --> 00:39:35.242
because we can change that
3/4ths to something else by --

00:39:35.242 --> 00:39:38.900
to a much smaller number -- by
increasing the temperature.

00:39:38.900 --> 00:39:40.570
So no way to do that one.
 

00:39:40.570 --> 00:39:46.190
But if we go to 3000 Kelvin,
then it's 250 reactions per

00:39:46.190 --> 00:39:47.110
second.
 

00:39:47.110 --> 00:39:50.081
So that's quite feasible,
as long as nothing else

00:39:50.081 --> 00:39:52.802
happens;
something else might be even

00:39:52.802 --> 00:39:53.329
faster.
 

00:39:53.329 --> 00:39:53.929
Right?
 

00:39:53.929 --> 00:39:57.161
But at least this mechanism
could work, if you were in a

00:39:57.161 --> 00:39:59.512
flame say, or in Professor
Chupka's oven,

00:39:59.512 --> 00:40:01.570
that we talked about last time.
 

00:40:01.570 --> 00:40:06.789
Okay, now let's look at
Eyring's H + H_2 here.

00:40:06.789 --> 00:40:08.659
So we want to get from this
valley to the other valley.

00:40:08.659 --> 00:40:09.820
How do we do it?
 

00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:14.012
This mechanism would be to
break a bond and then -- so

00:40:14.012 --> 00:40:16.860
dissociation and then
association.

00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:19.539
But uh, it's very slow to get
up there -- right?

00:40:19.539 --> 00:40:21.210
-- to get up to that plateau of
breaking a bond.

00:40:21.210 --> 00:40:24.449
There's a much easier way to
get from one valley to the

00:40:24.449 --> 00:40:24.809
other.
 

00:40:24.809 --> 00:40:25.650
What is it?
 

00:40:25.650 --> 00:40:29.340
Go through the pass. Right?
 

00:40:29.340 --> 00:40:33.786
So instead of doing that slow
reaction, you can do this much

00:40:33.786 --> 00:40:37.253
faster reaction,
making a new bond as you break

00:40:37.253 --> 00:40:38.460
the old one.
 

00:40:38.460 --> 00:40:41.539
So you don't have to pay all
the cost of breaking the old

00:40:41.539 --> 00:40:44.179
one, and you're getting
something back for it.

00:40:44.179 --> 00:40:47.179
So you can have a free radical
chain substitution,

00:40:47.179 --> 00:40:51.159
where you have an X atom -- and
we've talked about this before.

00:40:51.159 --> 00:40:52.500
Take the H away from R.
 

00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:56.159
Then the R group takes away X
from X_2.

00:40:56.159 --> 00:40:58.409
And it can just go round and
round.

00:40:58.409 --> 00:41:01.090
There's this machine,
very much like the machine that

00:41:01.090 --> 00:41:03.822
Professor Sharpless talked
about, that goes around and

00:41:03.822 --> 00:41:04.389
around.
 

00:41:04.389 --> 00:41:06.900
You feed in starting material,
and the products come out.

00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:08.369
And you don't -- it's a
catalyst;

00:41:08.369 --> 00:41:10.867
you don't have to go to such
high energies as you normally

00:41:10.867 --> 00:41:11.699
would have to do.
 

00:41:11.699 --> 00:41:15.588
So the possibility of
halogenation -- here we looked

00:41:15.588 --> 00:41:20.010
at it at equilibrium and saw
that forget it with iodine;

00:41:20.010 --> 00:41:21.010
the others look okay.
 

00:41:21.010 --> 00:41:24.510
And for a mechanism with a
reasonable rate,

00:41:24.510 --> 00:41:27.789
we could change those two
columns, exchange them,

00:41:27.789 --> 00:41:33.849
so that we make the H-X,
as we break CH_3-H --

00:41:33.849 --> 00:41:37.461
so the X atom helps you do that
-- and that generates then a

00:41:37.461 --> 00:41:39.576
CH_3 group,
which helps the reaction on the

00:41:39.576 --> 00:41:39.860
right.
 

00:41:39.860 --> 00:41:43.014
So now, step one,
how much energy do you have to

00:41:43.014 --> 00:41:43.619
put in?
 

00:41:43.619 --> 00:41:49.420
You're paying 105 but you're
getting back 136.

00:41:49.420 --> 00:41:51.070
So that's great. Right?
 

00:41:51.070 --> 00:41:54.650
The first step seems plausible
now;

00:41:54.650 --> 00:41:57.159
although you don't know how
high the barrier is that you

00:41:57.159 --> 00:41:59.349
have to get from starting
material to product.

00:41:59.349 --> 00:42:01.000
But at least it's much easier.
 

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:03.210
So the top one,
it looks good all around.

00:42:03.210 --> 00:42:06.512
The chlorine and bromine will
be a little touchy,

00:42:06.512 --> 00:42:09.952
on those first two steps,
because they're uphill in

00:42:09.952 --> 00:42:10.710
energy.
 

00:42:10.710 --> 00:42:14.530
But step two is good in all
cases.

00:42:14.530 --> 00:42:18.833
Okay, so what we need to do is
be able to predict activation

00:42:18.833 --> 00:42:19.489
energy.
 

00:42:19.489 --> 00:42:22.824
But Rome wasn't built in a day,
and that's going to happen next

00:42:22.824 --> 00:42:25.945
semester, to get into this and
to talk in more detail about

00:42:25.945 --> 00:42:27.559
these catalytic reactions.
 

00:42:27.559 --> 00:42:31.996
Notice that this is exactly the
kind of thing Sharpless was

00:42:31.996 --> 00:42:33.219
talking about.
 

00:42:33.219 --> 00:42:36.579
If you could find a way of
lowering one of these barriers,

00:42:36.579 --> 00:42:38.820
then the catalytic cycle would
work.

00:42:38.820 --> 00:42:40.117
He was saying,
remember, that it was

00:42:40.117 --> 00:42:41.577
democratic;
that all the steps,

00:42:41.577 --> 00:42:44.309
as you go around the cycle,
have to be at the same -- go at

00:42:44.309 --> 00:42:46.681
the same rate,
or else everything stops up,

00:42:46.681 --> 00:42:50.329
stops and waits before it tries
to get over some big step.

00:42:50.329 --> 00:42:52.730
So you have to have all the
steps be fast;

00:42:52.730 --> 00:42:57.775
and that's why he was saying
that that diisopropylethylamine

00:42:57.775 --> 00:43:00.940
helped the formation of
omeprazole.

00:43:00.940 --> 00:43:05.159
Well so we've been doing
organic chemistry this semester.

00:43:05.159 --> 00:43:08.119
Some people might doubt that.
 

00:43:08.119 --> 00:43:10.949
There'll be no doubt next
semester that everyone will

00:43:10.949 --> 00:43:13.400
agree that what we do is organic
chemistry.

00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:16.599
We're going to talk about the
chemistry of functional groups

00:43:16.599 --> 00:43:20.070
and sugars and amino acids and
all carbonyl groups and esters;

00:43:20.070 --> 00:43:20.860
all these things.
 

00:43:20.860 --> 00:43:24.170
But there's a reason that it's
been a little different this

00:43:24.170 --> 00:43:24.800
semester.
 

00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:27.699
We've talked mostly about
physical-organic chemistry.

00:43:27.699 --> 00:43:30.670
And the reason is because of
where I came from;

00:43:30.670 --> 00:43:32.010
that I did my Ph.D.
 

00:43:32.010 --> 00:43:34.842
-- and in fact I took a course
as an undergraduate with Paul

00:43:34.842 --> 00:43:35.900
Bartlett at Harvard.
 

00:43:35.900 --> 00:43:38.974
And as you've seen from our
common ancestry,

00:43:38.974 --> 00:43:41.550
he was a physical-organic
chemist;

00:43:41.550 --> 00:43:44.737
more interested in how
reactions work than in what you

00:43:44.737 --> 00:43:45.400
can make.
 

00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:50.389
Okay, so there's this book that
came out in 1939,

00:43:50.389 --> 00:43:52.250
went through at least three
editions --

00:43:52.250 --> 00:43:55.369
I have the Second and Third
Editions here --

00:43:55.369 --> 00:43:58.300
which is called The Nature
of the Chemical Bond.

00:43:58.300 --> 00:44:01.329
And this was a fabulously
influential book;

00:44:01.329 --> 00:44:06.320
even if it is the one that said
it was 126 kilocalories/mol,

00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:11.309
to take carbon away from
graphite, when we know it's 171.

00:44:11.309 --> 00:44:18.454
So Pauling was arguably the
most influential chemist of the

00:44:18.454 --> 00:44:20.920
Twentieth Century.
 

00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:22.409
He got two Nobel Prizes.
 

00:44:22.409 --> 00:44:24.030
&gt;
 

00:44:24.030 --> 00:44:27.123
Recording of Professor Jack
Dunitz:  At the time when I

00:44:27.123 --> 00:44:30.065
was reading that book I was
wondering whether chemistry was

00:44:30.065 --> 00:44:33.110
really as interesting as I had
hoped it was going to be.

00:44:33.110 --> 00:44:39.798
And I think I was almost ready
to give it up and do something

00:44:39.798 --> 00:44:40.579
else.
 

00:44:40.579 --> 00:44:46.007
I didn't care very much for
this chemistry which was full of

00:44:46.007 --> 00:44:50.331
facts and recipes and very
little thought in it,

00:44:50.331 --> 00:44:53.920
very little intellectual
structure.

00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:59.648
And Pauling's book gave me a
glimpse of what the future of

00:44:59.648 --> 00:45:03.867
chemistry was going to be and
particularly,

00:45:03.867 --> 00:45:06.179
perhaps, my future.
 

00:45:06.179 --> 00:45:07.619
Prof: Right, okay.
 

00:45:07.619 --> 00:45:09.929
So that's what we've been doing
the first semester,

00:45:09.929 --> 00:45:12.193
is this kind of thing,
thinking about the chemical

00:45:12.193 --> 00:45:12.610
bond.
 

00:45:12.610 --> 00:45:15.115
We started with wondering,
with Newton,

00:45:15.115 --> 00:45:19.007
whether there was an atomic
force law, and then we looked to

00:45:19.007 --> 00:45:21.909
see if we could see bonds,
or feel them.

00:45:21.909 --> 00:45:25.753
And then we tried to understand
bonding and reactivity,

00:45:25.753 --> 00:45:28.599
through the Schrödinger
equation;

00:45:28.599 --> 00:45:30.960
which most people believe is
the fundamental way to

00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:32.329
understand things properly.
 

00:45:32.329 --> 00:45:37.324
And then we learned how
chemists learned to treasure the

00:45:37.324 --> 00:45:38.960
molecular model.
 

00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:42.612
Things like this,
that turned out to be really,

00:45:42.612 --> 00:45:45.630
really useful tools --
composition,

00:45:45.630 --> 00:45:47.750
constitution,
configuration,

00:45:47.750 --> 00:45:53.960
and conformation --
and finally energy. Right?

00:45:53.960 --> 00:45:58.260
So I hope that we've this
semester,

00:45:58.260 --> 00:46:01.045
if we haven't done as much
organic chemistry as some people

00:46:01.045 --> 00:46:03.539
would care for,
that at least we've raised some

00:46:03.539 --> 00:46:07.976
big questions;
like how does science know

00:46:07.976 --> 00:46:08.958
things?
 

00:46:08.958 --> 00:46:10.079
Right?
 

00:46:10.079 --> 00:46:12.610
Or, compared to what?
 

00:46:12.610 --> 00:46:14.570
Those are the really big
questions.

00:46:14.570 --> 00:46:17.981
But even if we're only focusing
on the specific content of the

00:46:17.981 --> 00:46:21.226
course, interested in bonds,
here are two questions for you

00:46:21.226 --> 00:46:22.289
to think about.
 

00:46:22.289 --> 00:46:28.909
Were chemical bonds discovered
or were they invented?

00:46:28.909 --> 00:46:32.820
To what extent are chemical
bonds real?

00:46:32.820 --> 00:46:35.686
Or to what extent are they a
figment of a chemist's

00:46:35.686 --> 00:46:36.489
imagination?
 

00:46:36.489 --> 00:46:40.659
This is the kind of thing we've
been aiming at all semester.

00:46:40.659 --> 00:46:43.159
So you should be in a position
to think about this now.

00:46:43.159 --> 00:46:50.043
Or would we even have chemical
bonds, without our own chemical

00:46:50.043 --> 00:46:51.510
forbearers?
 

00:46:51.510 --> 00:46:54.155
So we've looked at how the idea
of bonds and these different

00:46:54.155 --> 00:46:55.590
properties of bonds developed.
 

00:46:55.590 --> 00:47:00.422
But suppose chemistry was
developing in some other solar

00:47:00.422 --> 00:47:01.039
system.
 

00:47:01.039 --> 00:47:01.829
Right?
 

00:47:01.829 --> 00:47:04.070
What would happen there?
 

00:47:04.070 --> 00:47:08.125
Suppose people discovered the
Schrödinger equation,

00:47:08.125 --> 00:47:10.780
before they had the idea of
bonds.

00:47:10.780 --> 00:47:13.570
Would bonds have been necessary?
 

00:47:13.570 --> 00:47:17.963
Is chemistry going to evolve,
such that all you need do is

00:47:17.963 --> 00:47:21.815
put stuff into a computer,
solve quantum mechanics,

00:47:21.815 --> 00:47:23.588
and forget about bonds?
 

00:47:23.588 --> 00:47:24.360
Okay?
 

00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:26.967
The answers to these questions
aren't obvious,

00:47:26.967 --> 00:47:29.230
but they're good ones to think
about.

00:47:29.230 --> 00:47:34.300
So this is the end,
and good luck on the final.

00:47:34.300 --> 00:47:35.949
Are you fired up?
 

00:47:35.949 --> 00:47:37.739
Students:  Yeah.
 

00:47:37.739 --> 00:47:39.190
Prof: Are you ready to
go?

00:47:39.190 --> 00:47:41.260
Good.
 

00:47:41.260 --> 00:47:42.789
Thanks.

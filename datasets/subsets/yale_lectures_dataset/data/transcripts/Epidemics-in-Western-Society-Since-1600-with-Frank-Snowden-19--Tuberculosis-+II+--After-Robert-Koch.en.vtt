00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:02.440
Prof: Good morning.
 

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:07.846
You'll remember that last time
we talked about dividing

00:00:07.846 --> 00:00:11.450
tuberculosis into two major
eras,

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:17.189
in terms of the way that it was
understood and experienced by

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:18.720
human society.
 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.854
The first era we talked about
last time was what I chose to

00:00:23.854 --> 00:00:26.510
call the age of consumption.
 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:30.234
At that time,
only the lungs were known to be

00:00:30.234 --> 00:00:34.246
affected by the disease,
as all other forms of

00:00:34.246 --> 00:00:37.635
tuberculosis,
as it's now understood,

00:00:37.635 --> 00:00:42.510
were then thought to be instead
different diseases.

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.110
At the time,
the theory of anticontagionism,

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.090
that by now is familiar to all
of you,

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.737
was still dominant,
and the tuberculosis patient

00:00:52.737 --> 00:00:55.783
was deemed to be,
should we say,

00:00:55.783 --> 00:01:01.188
blameless and harmless,
as he or she had a disease

00:01:01.188 --> 00:01:04.980
thought to be primarily
hereditary.

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:10.022
The treatments in fashion were
still traditional remedies of

00:01:10.022 --> 00:01:14.209
nineteenth-century medicine,
well familiar to you:

00:01:14.209 --> 00:01:17.030
venesection,
or bloodletting;

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.827
poultices were applied,
and people were given

00:01:20.827 --> 00:01:25.313
medications with an aim of
increasing their appetite,

00:01:25.313 --> 00:01:30.950
to combat the wasting away;
creosote was administered.

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.190
We know it now primarily as a
wood preservative,

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.250
but it was, in fact,
in the nineteenth century,

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.019
one of the chief medications
used to treat tuberculosis;

00:01:43.019 --> 00:01:46.742
and it was administered
sometimes internally,

00:01:46.742 --> 00:01:50.720
sometimes by inhalation to
relieve the cough.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:56.287
It was applied topically to the
larynx, to ease the coughing and

00:01:56.287 --> 00:02:00.263
alleviate ulceration,
and sometimes there were

00:02:00.263 --> 00:02:02.650
sub-mucosal injections.
 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:05.762
Sometimes quinine was
administered,

00:02:05.762 --> 00:02:10.340
with the strategy of lowering a
patient's fever.

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.900
And we've talked about gasses
that were administered to combat

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:21.277
the infection directly in the
lungs, sometimes carbolic acid

00:02:21.277 --> 00:02:22.188
spray.
 

00:02:22.188 --> 00:02:26.943
Opiates, like laudanum,
were sometimes given to relieve

00:02:26.943 --> 00:02:30.382
symptoms,
and patients were advised to

00:02:30.382 --> 00:02:33.530
travel to more salubrious
climates,

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.491
to visit the sea,
the mountains,

00:02:36.491 --> 00:02:42.500
the dry American southwest,
the Mediterranean.

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.008
And then we moved on from that
period,

00:02:46.008 --> 00:02:50.872
the age of consumption,
and saw the beginning of the

00:02:50.872 --> 00:02:53.669
age--
as I'd like to call it this

00:02:53.669 --> 00:02:57.211
morning--
the age of tuberculosis,

00:02:57.211 --> 00:02:59.848
from around the 1880s.
 

00:02:59.848 --> 00:03:05.801
And this was marked by a number
of factors that came together to

00:03:05.801 --> 00:03:09.472
foster new attitudes,
new treatments,

00:03:09.472 --> 00:03:13.584
and new public health
strategies to deal with

00:03:13.584 --> 00:03:15.080
tuberculosis.
 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.840
The first--and this man is by
now extremely famous to you,

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.729
and that's Robert Koch,
once again--

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:27.900
his theory of the germ theory
of disease,

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.199
and the discovery,
as you know,

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:35.030
of the bacterium that's the
causative agent in tuberculosis,

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.400
in 1882.
 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:43.411
But that wasn't sufficient to
launch what we call the age of

00:03:43.411 --> 00:03:44.940
tuberculosis.
 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.359
In addition,
I would say that it was

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:52.169
influenced by international
politics;

00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:58.510
a gathering of international
tensions, clashing imperialisms,

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.258
with colonial expansion.
 

00:04:01.258 --> 00:04:06.157
Remember then that this is a
time when population growth was

00:04:06.157 --> 00:04:09.810
held to be essential to military
strength;

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:13.991
indeed, to national survival,
to industrial production and

00:04:13.991 --> 00:04:15.240
economic power.
 

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:21.209
This was the age when social
Darwinism was at its height.

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:26.211
And in that context,
tuberculosis was held to be a

00:04:26.211 --> 00:04:28.560
real national danger.
 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.211
It was an internal danger,
and because of that,

00:04:32.211 --> 00:04:35.230
patients came to lose their
glamour.

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:40.117
They were no longer regarded as
creative, spiritual,

00:04:40.117 --> 00:04:44.720
sexy and ignoble,
but were thought to be a danger

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.500
to health and to society.
 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:51.254
So, that was a second--should
we call it the

00:04:51.254 --> 00:04:56.055
social/economic/diplomatic
context in which tuberculosis

00:04:56.055 --> 00:04:57.540
was situated.
 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:01.610
And then there were
epidemiological studies that

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:03.949
went along in the period.
 

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:10.459
Public health became much more
cognizant, through statistics,

00:05:10.459 --> 00:05:14.040
of the ravages of tuberculosis.
 

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:19.151
There were studies of its
transmission in society,

00:05:19.151 --> 00:05:22.697
and knowledge,
statistically based,

00:05:22.697 --> 00:05:25.410
now replaced anecdote.
 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:30.478
And the implication was that
although tuberculosis did indeed

00:05:30.478 --> 00:05:34.279
affect the elites of society and
the arts,

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:38.266
it was in fact
disproportionately a disease of

00:05:38.266 --> 00:05:40.779
the poor,
of the "dangerous

00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:42.100
classes"
and,

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:45.769
in the American context,
of unsavory,

00:05:45.769 --> 00:05:49.853
impoverished immigrants,
a disease of Irish and

00:05:49.853 --> 00:05:50.829
Italians.
 

00:05:50.829 --> 00:05:56.810
And, so, tuberculosis slowly
becomes more stigmatized and

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:58.519
more shameful.
 

00:05:58.519 --> 00:06:04.125
Well, the result of all of
these converging factors was

00:06:04.125 --> 00:06:09.497
from about 1880 to 1940,
an age of tuberculosis,

00:06:09.497 --> 00:06:14.410
certainly, but also a war on
tuberculosis,

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:19.892
with new strategies of public
health to combat what was seen

00:06:19.892 --> 00:06:24.540
to be a major national and
international menace.

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:29.622
So, let's look at the weapons
in the new war in

00:06:29.622 --> 00:06:33.379
anti-tuberculosis public health.
 

00:06:33.379 --> 00:06:39.339
The first chronologically was
also the most distinctive,

00:06:39.339 --> 00:06:43.110
and in some ways the most
interesting and creative,

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:47.199
and this was the establishment
of sanatoria--

00:06:47.199 --> 00:06:52.055
or sanitaria,
if you prefer--which gave rise

00:06:52.055 --> 00:06:56.800
to an international sanatorium
movement.

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:00.451
The prototype,
and the world's first TB

00:07:00.451 --> 00:07:03.720
sanatorium, was founded in 1859.
 

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:08.194
But the movement then slowly
gathered momentum towards the

00:07:08.194 --> 00:07:12.747
ends of the century,
and then continued down to

00:07:12.747 --> 00:07:17.209
about the 1950s,
when antibiotics led to the

00:07:17.209 --> 00:07:22.237
closing of the sanatoria,
and for a time a euphoric view

00:07:22.237 --> 00:07:26.019
that tuberculosis was about to
be eradicated;

00:07:26.019 --> 00:07:31.019
a view that unfortunately has
turned out not to be the case.

00:07:31.019 --> 00:07:35.589
The founding father of the
sanatorium movement was a

00:07:35.589 --> 00:07:37.920
German, Hermann Brehmer.
 

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:41.629
He was a physician,
and fell ill with

00:07:41.629 --> 00:07:47.711
tuberculosis--not something at
all unusual--and expecting to

00:07:47.711 --> 00:07:53.379
die, he traveled to take the
cure in the Himalayas.

00:07:53.379 --> 00:07:56.559
To his surprise,
though, he recovered,

00:07:56.559 --> 00:08:00.855
and he attributed his improved
health to fresh air,

00:08:00.855 --> 00:08:02.660
climate and rest.
 

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:07.745
And he thought that he could
generalize that to treating

00:08:07.745 --> 00:08:13.569
patients, and in 1859 he founded
the world's first sanatorium in

00:08:13.569 --> 00:08:14.680
Silesia.
 

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:20.228
This was followed by Peter
Dettweiler, who founded,

00:08:20.228 --> 00:08:26.220
in 1876, the second major
sanatorium at Falkenstein.

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:32.327
Despite those two examples,
the sanatorium idea didn't

00:08:32.327 --> 00:08:39.360
really take off to become a
major movement until the 1880s.

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:44.784
And the decisive influence was
that of the American physician

00:08:44.784 --> 00:08:47.644
who has,
through his offspring,

00:08:47.644 --> 00:08:51.697
a Yale connection,
and that's Edward Livingston

00:08:51.697 --> 00:08:55.024
Trudeau,
who lived from 1848,

00:08:55.024 --> 00:08:58.964
and is well-known,
the Trudeau name,

00:08:58.964 --> 00:09:02.812
to all of you as the
great-grandfather of Gary

00:09:02.812 --> 00:09:05.379
Trudeau of Doonesbury fame.
 

00:09:05.379 --> 00:09:11.840
Let me just--I have a
couple--that's Edward Livingston

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:13.058
Trudeau.
 

00:09:13.058 --> 00:09:17.815
Let's remember a moment about
his life and how he came to play

00:09:17.815 --> 00:09:21.090
a major role in the sanatorium
movement.

00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:26.811
He was a physician educated at
the Columbia Medical School in

00:09:26.811 --> 00:09:27.860
New York.
 

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:32.629
His brother had tuberculosis,
and he died of it.

00:09:32.629 --> 00:09:38.825
He himself was diagnosed with
tuberculosis in the 1870s

00:09:38.825 --> 00:09:45.594
and--this is a story that you've
heard more than one--he too

00:09:45.594 --> 00:09:49.840
thought that he was going to
die.

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:55.057
But he followed medical advice
and went to an outdoor climate

00:09:55.057 --> 00:09:56.710
to take the cure.
 

00:09:56.710 --> 00:10:01.263
In his case,
his preferred destination was

00:10:01.263 --> 00:10:07.259
the Adirondack Mountains,
and specifically Saranac Lake

00:10:07.259 --> 00:10:10.370
in upper New York State.
 

00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:16.144
At Saranac Lake,
which was at the time not a

00:10:16.144 --> 00:10:20.619
town at all,
it was the wilderness,

00:10:20.619 --> 00:10:25.649
and Trudeau spent his time
largely resting,

00:10:25.649 --> 00:10:30.360
and he would hunt from fixed
positions in a canoe on Saranac

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:33.048
Lake,
or behind a blind.

00:10:33.048 --> 00:10:37.139
And as far as possible,
he stayed outdoors.

00:10:37.139 --> 00:10:41.760
Expecting to die,
instead he realized that he was

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:46.477
starting to feel better,
and he too attributed his

00:10:46.477 --> 00:10:50.330
recovery to this fresh air and
rest;

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:55.288
and he too felt that this was
an experience that could be

00:10:55.288 --> 00:10:56.529
generalized.
 

00:10:56.529 --> 00:11:00.494
He became increasingly
interested in the medical

00:11:00.494 --> 00:11:05.216
literature on tuberculosis,
and he read about Brehmer and

00:11:05.216 --> 00:11:06.820
his sanatorium.
 

00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:10.711
But in the 1870s,
there'd been little interest in

00:11:10.711 --> 00:11:15.658
the medical profession in the
disease or in Brehmer's idea.

00:11:15.658 --> 00:11:21.009
The 1880s, because of Koch's
major epoch-making discovery,

00:11:21.009 --> 00:11:25.927
however, created an entirely
different and more susceptive

00:11:25.927 --> 00:11:30.423
climate to the whole idea,
and Trudeau became an early

00:11:30.423 --> 00:11:34.412
convert to the idea of
contagionism and the germ theory

00:11:34.412 --> 00:11:38.802
of disease,
with specific reference to

00:11:38.802 --> 00:11:40.570
tuberculosis.
 

00:11:40.570 --> 00:11:50.135
So, in 1884--this is a statue
of Edward Livingston Trudeau at

00:11:50.135 --> 00:11:58.586
Saranac Lake--he established
Little Red, which was the

00:11:58.586 --> 00:12:03.690
beginning of the sanatorium.
 

00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:08.376
This was in 1884,
which is the beginning then of

00:12:08.376 --> 00:12:12.466
the establishment of a small
rest cottage,

00:12:12.466 --> 00:12:18.350
Little Red, for the treatment
of tuberculosis patients.

00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:23.394
This is a picture of Little
Red, the first building in what

00:12:23.394 --> 00:12:26.440
becomes a much larger
sanatorium.

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:32.950
And that's a picture of the
inside of the sanatorium.

00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:38.129
There were several ideas that
Trudeau embodied in the

00:12:38.129 --> 00:12:44.105
sanatorium, and the first was
that the sanatorium was a means

00:12:44.105 --> 00:12:45.798
of treatment.
 

00:12:45.798 --> 00:12:51.210
And let's look at the treatment
ideas that Trudeau had in mind.

00:12:51.210 --> 00:12:54.275
The first was what he called
the wilderness cure,

00:12:54.275 --> 00:12:56.960
the one that he had experienced
himself;

00:12:56.960 --> 00:13:01.000
that is to say,
that you should live outdoors

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.767
in all weather,
taking the cure on cottage

00:13:04.767 --> 00:13:05.870
porches.
 

00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:09.924
And, so, there was a document
called "The Rules for

00:13:09.924 --> 00:13:13.465
Patients at the Sanatorium at
Saranac Lake,"

00:13:13.465 --> 00:13:17.595
and it said the following:
"Patients are expected to

00:13:17.595 --> 00:13:22.450
lead an outdoor life,
to remain eight to ten hours in

00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:24.610
the open air every day.
 

00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:29.519
Each patient is required to be
out of doors from 9:00 a.m.

00:13:29.519 --> 00:13:34.230
to 12:45 p.m.,
and again from 2:00 p.m.

00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:38.029
to 5:45 every day.
 

00:13:38.029 --> 00:13:41.863
And sleeping out is considered
in no way to affect the

00:13:41.863 --> 00:13:43.308
requirement."
 

00:13:43.308 --> 00:13:47.330
So, the outdoor life was
compulsory.

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:49.509
Second was rest.
 

00:13:49.509 --> 00:13:54.700
The patients at Saranac Lake
were to have no exercise.

00:13:54.700 --> 00:14:02.052
A patient with a temperature of
99.5 degrees was allowed half an

00:14:02.052 --> 00:14:08.116
hour of exercise a day;
and exercise included standing

00:14:08.116 --> 00:14:13.258
up and getting dressed,
or walking to the refectory for

00:14:13.258 --> 00:14:16.001
a meal,
and even getting in and out of

00:14:16.001 --> 00:14:18.149
bed was thought to be exercise.
 

00:14:18.149 --> 00:14:22.210
So, there was very little that
you were allowed to do.

00:14:22.210 --> 00:14:27.409
The third thing that was part
of the sanatorium regimen at

00:14:27.409 --> 00:14:31.260
Saranac Lake--
and I'm choosing Saranac Lake

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:35.796
because this was the model
sanatorium that really became

00:14:35.796 --> 00:14:39.918
the ideal for an entire
international movement;

00:14:39.918 --> 00:14:46.620
thousands of sanatoria were
founded on this model.

00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:51.514
The third treatment idea was a
solid substantial diet,

00:14:51.514 --> 00:14:55.023
to combat the consumption,
if you like,

00:14:55.023 --> 00:15:00.379
the wasting away of the body,
and to build resistance.

00:15:00.379 --> 00:15:05.386
In pursuit of that goal,
patients at Saranac Lake had

00:15:05.386 --> 00:15:08.950
four compulsory hardy meals a
day,

00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:14.072
with milk served in between,
with a strong emphasis on meat

00:15:14.072 --> 00:15:15.840
and carbohydrates.
 

00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:21.850
The goal was for the patient to
consume 4,000 calories a day.

00:15:21.850 --> 00:15:26.572
Another point about the
treatment regimen is that the

00:15:26.572 --> 00:15:31.658
sanatorium was what we might
call a total institution.

00:15:31.658 --> 00:15:37.883
Unlike the old idea of taking
the cure, at the sanatorium at

00:15:37.883 --> 00:15:43.580
Saranac Lake patients were under
constant vigilance.

00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:48.183
That was one of the reasons
that you kept them on the

00:15:48.183 --> 00:15:52.092
porches;
on a porch you were constantly

00:15:52.092 --> 00:15:53.000
in view.
 

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.548
And visitors were strictly
regulated.

00:15:56.548 --> 00:16:01.432
The patients' mail was
censored, the idea being that

00:16:01.432 --> 00:16:07.081
they should be sheltered from
distressing news and emotional

00:16:07.081 --> 00:16:11.769
shocks--
those were not conducive to

00:16:11.769 --> 00:16:13.080
recovery.
 

00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:16.577
The rules, therefore,
stipulated that you weren't

00:16:16.577 --> 00:16:20.062
allowed,
as a patient at Saranac Lake,

00:16:20.062 --> 00:16:25.784
to discuss your disease,
even with fellow patients at

00:16:25.784 --> 00:16:27.678
the sanatorium.
 

00:16:27.678 --> 00:16:33.027
The rules also stated that
there was to be no alcohol or

00:16:33.027 --> 00:16:36.033
tobacco;
that there was to be no

00:16:36.033 --> 00:16:39.658
socializing for more than an
hour a day;

00:16:39.658 --> 00:16:44.408
and there were to be no indoor
visits from members of the

00:16:44.408 --> 00:16:45.678
opposite sex.
 

00:16:45.678 --> 00:16:49.702
You also--I'm not sure of the
medical purpose of this,

00:16:49.702 --> 00:16:53.120
but these rules were enforced
by expulsion.

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:57.120
If you violated the rules,
you couldn't stay.

00:16:57.120 --> 00:17:03.649
And the rules also said that
you couldn't practice profanity.

00:17:03.649 --> 00:17:06.970
You weren't allowed to gamble.
 

00:17:06.970 --> 00:17:09.710
Those were part of the cure as
well.

00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:14.710
And the next idea of this was
segregation;

00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:19.138
that is, I'm not meaning racial
segregation now,

00:17:19.138 --> 00:17:20.930
I mean isolation.
 

00:17:20.930 --> 00:17:23.538
There were individual rooms,
with porches,

00:17:23.538 --> 00:17:26.210
where patients were always out
of doors.

00:17:26.210 --> 00:17:31.082
This is the polar opposite of
crowded conditions in tenements

00:17:31.082 --> 00:17:35.548
that were thought to be the
great means of spreading the

00:17:35.548 --> 00:17:37.660
tuberculosis epidemic.
 

00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:42.450
And Trudeau carried out--there
was an island.

00:17:42.450 --> 00:17:46.380
If you visit Saranac Lake,
you'll notice that there is an

00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:49.680
island which is called fondly
Rabbit Island,

00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:52.558
in the center,
where Trudeau,

00:17:52.558 --> 00:17:57.289
during his self-imposed exile
for the cure,

00:17:57.289 --> 00:18:00.269
had gone hunting and so on.
 

00:18:00.269 --> 00:18:04.420
But he also conducted an
experiment on Rabbit Island,

00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:08.430
and the experiment
consisted--I'm not sure what you

00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:12.278
think of the robust scientific
quality of it,

00:18:12.278 --> 00:18:15.715
but it certainly convinced
Edward Livingston Trudeau

00:18:15.715 --> 00:18:16.390
himself.
 

00:18:16.390 --> 00:18:21.548
He took, I think,
ten rabbits onto Rabbit Island,

00:18:21.548 --> 00:18:27.676
and five of them were allowed
to live free in good outdoor

00:18:27.676 --> 00:18:29.288
conditions.
 

00:18:29.288 --> 00:18:34.748
The other five were put in
artificial facsimiles of

00:18:34.748 --> 00:18:39.763
tenement conditions;
that is, they were confined to

00:18:39.763 --> 00:18:43.424
insalubrious,
unsanitary, crowded cardboard

00:18:43.424 --> 00:18:44.210
boxes.
 

00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:47.130
And at the end of a certain
period,

00:18:47.130 --> 00:18:51.923
Trudeau noticed that the five
confined rabbits had died of

00:18:51.923 --> 00:18:54.655
tuberculosis,
and the other five,

00:18:54.655 --> 00:18:57.720
who were leading the hardy
outdoor life,

00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:02.338
were a good advertisement for a
sanatorium and the outdoor cure.

00:19:02.338 --> 00:19:07.519
Well, let's take a little tour
of this sanatorium.

00:19:07.519 --> 00:19:12.920
And we saw it started at Little
Red, in very humble beginnings.

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:17.140
But then I say this was the
total life.

00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:19.808
This was the library.
 

00:19:19.808 --> 00:19:23.384
As you got better,
you were allowed to do a little

00:19:23.384 --> 00:19:26.446
bit more,
and you could progress to the

00:19:26.446 --> 00:19:31.048
point where you'd be allowed the
strenuous exercise of reading

00:19:31.048 --> 00:19:33.690
books in the sanatorium library.
 

00:19:33.690 --> 00:19:37.842
There was also the idea that
this would be an educational

00:19:37.842 --> 00:19:41.405
experience,
and you would take back skills

00:19:41.405 --> 00:19:46.204
and knowledge that would be
essential to you after you had

00:19:46.204 --> 00:19:49.490
been discharged from the
sanatorium.

00:19:49.490 --> 00:19:53.792
And this is the workshop where
you would learn skills or a

00:19:53.792 --> 00:19:56.210
craft that you could exercise.
 

00:19:56.210 --> 00:20:00.450
Remember that you might still
be something of an invalid,

00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:04.836
and it would be important that
you would have those sorts of

00:20:04.836 --> 00:20:10.825
skills that you were capable of,
a craft that you could carry

00:20:10.825 --> 00:20:11.430
out.
 

00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:16.808
There was the chapel at the
sanatorium.

00:20:16.808 --> 00:20:20.358
Here is one of the pure
cottages;

00:20:20.358 --> 00:20:24.930
and you'll note a proliferation
of porches at Saranac Lake.

00:20:24.930 --> 00:20:30.528
And these are more of the
buildings.

00:20:30.528 --> 00:20:33.460
This is the central
administration.

00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:37.537
And here we actually see
patients doing what they did

00:20:37.537 --> 00:20:40.358
most of the time at Saranac
Lake,

00:20:40.358 --> 00:20:46.925
and this is taking the cure in
the horizontal position and

00:20:46.925 --> 00:20:48.769
being watched.
 

00:20:48.769 --> 00:20:54.779
You were also educated to use
this little fashion accessory,

00:20:54.779 --> 00:20:57.529
which is your sputum cup.
 

00:20:57.529 --> 00:21:00.732
In other words,
your sputum was thought to be

00:21:00.732 --> 00:21:03.500
extremely dangerous and
contagious,

00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:07.473
and therefore you were not to
spit on the ground but in this

00:21:07.473 --> 00:21:08.348
little cup.
 

00:21:08.348 --> 00:21:13.510
So, the education of patients
then, in contagionist theory,

00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:16.269
was a part of the experience.
 

00:21:16.269 --> 00:21:23.038
They were issued with sputum
cups, with handkerchiefs.

00:21:23.038 --> 00:21:26.640
Spitting was strictly forbidden
at Saranac Lake,

00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:30.574
on pain of expulsion,
and patients had severe

00:21:30.574 --> 00:21:35.848
instructions to suppress their
coughs whenever possible,

00:21:35.848 --> 00:21:39.160
and to cover their faces when
they did.

00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:44.710
So, Saranac Lake then was not
just for its own patients.

00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:49.494
It was also conceived of to
spread the idea of the

00:21:49.494 --> 00:21:51.838
sanatorium as a model.
 

00:21:51.838 --> 00:21:56.836
And Trudeau--and this was one
of his great assets,

00:21:56.836 --> 00:22:02.545
he was really skilled at
publicity--he became a full-time

00:22:02.545 --> 00:22:06.930
agent for his own humanitarian
project.

00:22:06.930 --> 00:22:11.071
Well, the Saranac Lake
Sanatorium then was a place of

00:22:11.071 --> 00:22:14.019
treatment and a place of
education.

00:22:14.019 --> 00:22:18.126
It was also a place of
scientific research,

00:22:18.126 --> 00:22:22.038
featuring the science of
tuberculosis.

00:22:22.038 --> 00:22:26.507
At Saranac Lake,
Trudeau founded the world's

00:22:26.507 --> 00:22:32.430
first laboratory devoted to the
study of tuberculosis,

00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:37.180
and Koch's techniques of
microscopy,

00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:42.220
that Trudeau so much admired,
were followed and taught.

00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:45.690
Medical students were taught
staining,

00:22:45.690 --> 00:22:49.700
the culturing of bacteria,
diagnosis,

00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:56.255
and there was a six-week course
for already qualified physicians

00:22:56.255 --> 00:22:59.384
for an internship,
if you like,

00:22:59.384 --> 00:23:03.640
in the Saranac Lake laboratory
and at the sanatorium.

00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:06.740
And there were courses for
nurses as well.

00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:08.288
Well, what were the results?
 

00:23:08.288 --> 00:23:13.508
Trudeau himself was very
optimistic that this institution

00:23:13.508 --> 00:23:18.538
had positive results for the
health of his patients.

00:23:18.538 --> 00:23:24.205
He argued that normally an
active case of tuberculosis was

00:23:24.205 --> 00:23:28.059
almost universally fatal,
but Trudeau,

00:23:28.059 --> 00:23:31.451
by contrast,
claimed that he achieved a

00:23:31.451 --> 00:23:35.108
recovery rate of about thirty
percent.

00:23:35.108 --> 00:23:39.588
And, so, he adopted,
for Saranac Lake,

00:23:39.588 --> 00:23:47.269
a little slogan of his own,
which was "cure sometimes,

00:23:47.269 --> 00:23:54.680
relief often,
and comfort always."

00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:59.692
So, those were parts of the
mission of the Saranac Lake

00:23:59.692 --> 00:24:00.900
Sanatorium.
 

00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:06.924
We should also see it though as
an instrument of public health,

00:24:06.924 --> 00:24:12.269
based on the idea of the
isolation of the contagious.

00:24:12.269 --> 00:24:18.358
Trudeau estimated that each
tuberculosis patient in a year,

00:24:18.358 --> 00:24:24.900
if he or she continued to live
in an urban environment,

00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:29.528
would on average infect another
twenty people.

00:24:29.528 --> 00:24:35.470
So, we could see the sanatorium
as a kind of quarantine.

00:24:35.470 --> 00:24:41.232
And its particular idea was
that this was to remove working

00:24:41.232 --> 00:24:44.910
people, and people of modest
means.

00:24:44.910 --> 00:24:49.489
In other words,
this first American sanatorium

00:24:49.489 --> 00:24:52.440
was a work of philanthropy.
 

00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:57.124
Patients, at most--there was a
sliding scale of expense,

00:24:57.124 --> 00:25:02.234
and patients were charged at
most half the cost of their stay

00:25:02.234 --> 00:25:04.278
and their treatment.
 

00:25:04.278 --> 00:25:06.450
And the endowment of the
sanatorium--

00:25:06.450 --> 00:25:11.076
because Trudeau was very
effective at gaining approaching

00:25:11.076 --> 00:25:15.538
donors and getting financial
support for this idea--

00:25:15.538 --> 00:25:19.516
and, so, the endowment of the
sanatorium made up the

00:25:19.516 --> 00:25:20.528
difference.
 

00:25:20.528 --> 00:25:25.375
So, there was a considerable
number then of patients with no

00:25:25.375 --> 00:25:29.318
funds, who were subsidized by
the institution.

00:25:29.318 --> 00:25:35.184
Well, this went on as well--we
can see a relationship between

00:25:35.184 --> 00:25:38.540
tuberculosis also and,
should we say,

00:25:38.540 --> 00:25:42.681
economic development,
in that the sanatorium became

00:25:42.681 --> 00:25:47.509
the centerpiece also for the
development of a town--

00:25:47.509 --> 00:25:52.347
that is, Saranac Lake as a
town--which was based on

00:25:52.347 --> 00:25:53.798
tuberculosis.
 

00:25:53.798 --> 00:25:59.080
And Edward Livingston Trudeau,
in fact, was also the mayor of

00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:00.048
the town.
 

00:26:00.048 --> 00:26:04.354
Well, initially those--we
should remember that if you

00:26:04.354 --> 00:26:08.410
think getting into Yale was
difficult for you,

00:26:08.410 --> 00:26:12.450
getting a place at the Saranac
Lake Sanatorium,

00:26:12.450 --> 00:26:16.630
if you had tuberculosis,
was even more difficult.

00:26:16.630 --> 00:26:24.000
There was a rate of about 2,000
people applying for every place.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:28.767
And, so, the city,
or Town of Saranac Lake,

00:26:28.767 --> 00:26:35.124
sprang up as a place where
people could be taken care of,

00:26:35.124 --> 00:26:40.798
who weren't admitted to the
sanatorium itself.

00:26:40.798 --> 00:26:44.156
In other words,
the town was filled with

00:26:44.156 --> 00:26:48.260
cottages,
with boardinghouses with cure

00:26:48.260 --> 00:26:51.535
porches,
and the local board of health,

00:26:51.535 --> 00:26:56.452
of the town,
supervised and regulated what

00:26:56.452 --> 00:27:00.068
went on in these cottages.
 

00:27:00.068 --> 00:27:06.030
There were district nurses who
gave advice and monitored

00:27:06.030 --> 00:27:07.440
conditions.
 

00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:11.211
And there was a Bureau of
Information in the town,

00:27:11.211 --> 00:27:15.140
to assist patients to find
suitable arrangements.

00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:18.858
And then there were so-called
reception cottages,

00:27:18.858 --> 00:27:22.967
for patients so ill that they
would be rejected by the

00:27:22.967 --> 00:27:26.608
sanatorium, and by the
boardinghouses even.

00:27:26.608 --> 00:27:30.380
One of the features of the
sanatorium--

00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:35.680
it's difficult at Saranac Lake
to determine the effect,

00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:40.473
because there was considerable
triage among those who were

00:27:40.473 --> 00:27:41.400
admitted.
 

00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:45.550
And one of the features of it
was that Trudeau didn't wish to

00:27:45.550 --> 00:27:49.771
take people into the sanatorium
whom he considered so ill that

00:27:49.771 --> 00:27:52.538
nothing more could be done for
them.

00:27:52.538 --> 00:27:56.150
He wanted people who would
actually benefit from his cure.

00:27:56.150 --> 00:28:00.151
So, in that sense,
the statistics were a little

00:28:00.151 --> 00:28:04.846
bit massaged by the fact that
the most serious cases of

00:28:04.846 --> 00:28:08.240
tuberculosis didn't figure in
them.

00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:12.660
Well, the idea of the
sanatorium spread,

00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:15.038
and spread rapidly.
 

00:28:15.038 --> 00:28:19.844
It wasn't long before every
state in the nation had a

00:28:19.844 --> 00:28:21.970
network of sanatoria.
 

00:28:21.970 --> 00:28:25.945
And some of them were
specialized: some for the

00:28:25.945 --> 00:28:28.539
indigent, that is,
the poor;

00:28:28.539 --> 00:28:33.068
some for women;
some for African-Americans.

00:28:33.068 --> 00:28:38.409
Abroad, there were also
sanatoria, the most famous in

00:28:38.409 --> 00:28:41.980
Switzerland,
in Davos--you can read about it

00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:44.930
in Thomas Mann's The Magic
Mountain--

00:28:44.930 --> 00:28:48.009
and that was clearly a
sanatorium that wasn't

00:28:48.009 --> 00:28:51.630
subsidized but was,
in fact, for the social elite.

00:28:51.630 --> 00:28:56.757
So, there were also sanatoria
of various types,

00:28:56.757 --> 00:29:02.328
for various social classes and
social groupings.

00:29:02.328 --> 00:29:07.430
There were also distinctions
within the movement in the

00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:09.130
sanatorium idea.
 

00:29:09.130 --> 00:29:13.646
In England, for example,
they shared the idea of the

00:29:13.646 --> 00:29:18.742
importance of the outdoor life,
diet and surveillance,

00:29:18.742 --> 00:29:24.330
but they differed in that they
thought that the kind of rest

00:29:24.330 --> 00:29:29.920
regimen that Trudeau had in mind
was counterproductive,

00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:32.730
and that this would ruin
working people,

00:29:32.730 --> 00:29:36.380
who would get used to a life of
idleness.

00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:40.835
So, in England the sanatoria
instead practiced what was

00:29:40.835 --> 00:29:44.876
called graduated exercise,
and instead of the rest

00:29:44.876 --> 00:29:48.259
treatment we have the work
treatment.

00:29:48.259 --> 00:29:53.844
And those of you who are skiers
know that the slopes are given

00:29:53.844 --> 00:29:58.513
color codes: your black
diamonds, your blue and your

00:29:58.513 --> 00:30:00.618
green, for example.
 

00:30:00.618 --> 00:30:04.945
Well, at the British sanatoria,
there were walks for the

00:30:04.945 --> 00:30:07.994
patients,
and they were also color coded

00:30:07.994 --> 00:30:12.207
according to difficulty and how
much it was going to make you

00:30:12.207 --> 00:30:12.980
breathe.
 

00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:19.593
And inmates then--as you got
well, you were encouraged to

00:30:19.593 --> 00:30:24.200
take walks of progressive
difficulty.

00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:29.653
In the inter-war period,
there were some additional

00:30:29.653 --> 00:30:34.779
innovations in the treatment of
tuberculosis.

00:30:34.779 --> 00:30:39.289
One was--this is still before
the age of antibiotics,

00:30:39.289 --> 00:30:43.019
you see--and one was a surgical
approach.

00:30:43.019 --> 00:30:46.922
And this was practiced at
Saranac Lake as well,

00:30:46.922 --> 00:30:50.483
the idea being to extend rest
to have real,

00:30:50.483 --> 00:30:52.858
total rest of the lungs.
 

00:30:52.858 --> 00:30:57.130
This was termed artificial
pneumothorax;

00:30:57.130 --> 00:31:01.308
and that means that air was
injected,

00:31:01.308 --> 00:31:03.666
or another gas,
like nitrogen,

00:31:03.666 --> 00:31:07.568
into the pleural cavity to
collapse the lung,

00:31:07.568 --> 00:31:11.630
or the lungs,
by subjecting it or them to

00:31:11.630 --> 00:31:13.660
external pressure.
 

00:31:13.660 --> 00:31:19.248
The procedure was developed in
the 1890s, and came into vogue

00:31:19.248 --> 00:31:23.720
after World War I,
especially in this country.

00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:28.060
Very invasively,
some surgeons even decided to

00:31:28.060 --> 00:31:33.463
make the collapse permanent by
removing patients' ribs to

00:31:33.463 --> 00:31:36.068
paralyze the diaphragm.
 

00:31:36.068 --> 00:31:42.661
Let me show you--this is a
patient undergoing pneumothorax,

00:31:42.661 --> 00:31:46.980
the artificial collapse of the
lung.

00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:53.900
And this is a diagram of the
pneumothorax apparatus.

00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:59.355
The remark of one surgeon was
this, in a burst of surgical

00:31:59.355 --> 00:32:00.410
optimism.
 

00:32:00.410 --> 00:32:05.557
He said, "Physicians have
treated tuberculosis for 2,000

00:32:05.557 --> 00:32:07.960
years, and without effect.
 

00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:13.308
It's time now for us surgeons
to show the way."

00:32:13.308 --> 00:32:18.606
The analogy was that of the
resting of a broken limb in a

00:32:18.606 --> 00:32:19.269
cast.
 

00:32:19.269 --> 00:32:22.608
Unfortunately,
however, statistics seemed to

00:32:22.608 --> 00:32:26.880
indicate that the results were
deeply disappointing,

00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:33.259
and the procedure was almost
totally abandoned by 1940.

00:32:33.259 --> 00:32:36.390
Fortunately,
however, there were other

00:32:36.390 --> 00:32:39.519
weapons in the war on
tuberculosis.

00:32:39.519 --> 00:32:45.678
One was another institution,
in addition to the sanatoria,

00:32:45.678 --> 00:32:48.920
and that's the dispensaries.
 

00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:52.250
In cities to which patients
returned,

00:32:52.250 --> 00:32:56.630
after discharge from hospitals
and sanatoria,

00:32:56.630 --> 00:33:01.353
they needed follow-up care,
and the dispensaries were

00:33:01.353 --> 00:33:05.348
designed to provide that in the
community.

00:33:05.348 --> 00:33:09.220
They also taught hygienic
education,

00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:13.666
reminding patients that even
after discharge from the

00:33:13.666 --> 00:33:17.285
sanatoria,
they still weren't allowed to

00:33:17.285 --> 00:33:19.699
spit,
and they should cover up their

00:33:19.699 --> 00:33:23.894
faces when coughing or sneezing,
and they should tell everyone

00:33:23.894 --> 00:33:26.410
in their families to do the
same.

00:33:26.410 --> 00:33:29.911
So, these were,
in part, health education

00:33:29.911 --> 00:33:31.048
facilities.
 

00:33:31.048 --> 00:33:35.368
They also performed what we
might call social work services.

00:33:35.368 --> 00:33:39.568
They helped recovering patients
to find jobs that were suitable

00:33:39.568 --> 00:33:41.058
for their condition.
 

00:33:41.058 --> 00:33:45.108
Sometimes they provided loans
or cash grants,

00:33:45.108 --> 00:33:49.192
or food to tide patients over
while they attempted to get back

00:33:49.192 --> 00:33:53.730
on their feet,
after a prolonged period of

00:33:53.730 --> 00:33:56.000
being unemployed.
 

00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:02.634
There were also--these were
joined by campaigning voluntary

00:34:02.634 --> 00:34:04.348
associations.
 

00:34:04.348 --> 00:34:10.130
And, so, we see a proliferation
of what we might now call NGOs.

00:34:10.130 --> 00:34:14.652
In England was the National
Association for the Prevention

00:34:14.652 --> 00:34:18.302
of Consumption and Other Forms
of Tuberculosis,

00:34:18.302 --> 00:34:19.889
founded in 1898.
 

00:34:19.889 --> 00:34:23.402
And there were similar
associations in France,

00:34:23.402 --> 00:34:26.054
Germany, Belgium,
Portugal, Canada,

00:34:26.054 --> 00:34:28.396
Denmark, Sweden,
Russia, Japan,

00:34:28.396 --> 00:34:30.268
Norway, Australia.
 

00:34:30.268 --> 00:34:34.112
And in our country there was
the National Tuberculosis

00:34:34.112 --> 00:34:38.679
Association, that's now called
the American Lung Association.

00:34:38.679 --> 00:34:42.530
And I wonder if you could guess
who its first president was?

00:34:42.530 --> 00:34:45.500
Well your friend,
Edward Livingston Trudeau.

00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:49.880
I said he was a propagandist of
genius.

00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:53.621
The mission of these
associations again was to

00:34:53.621 --> 00:34:56.949
educate the public about the
disease,

00:34:56.949 --> 00:35:00.853
to help teach people in how
they could protect themselves

00:35:00.853 --> 00:35:04.394
from it,
and also protect those around

00:35:04.394 --> 00:35:04.969
them.
 

00:35:04.969 --> 00:35:08.233
And they spent a lot of time
attacking the social

00:35:08.233 --> 00:35:11.905
construction of tuberculosis
from the first half of the

00:35:11.905 --> 00:35:16.349
nineteenth century;
that is, the romantic idea of

00:35:16.349 --> 00:35:17.739
tuberculosis.
 

00:35:17.739 --> 00:35:20.994
They stressed,
in pamphlets and in lectures,

00:35:20.994 --> 00:35:24.929
that tuberculosis was neither
romantic nor poetic.

00:35:24.929 --> 00:35:29.150
One pamphlet wrote--and I think
it laid it on a bit a heavy--

00:35:29.150 --> 00:35:35.914
it said, "TB is a coarse,
common, vulgar disease,

00:35:35.914 --> 00:35:42.050
bred in foul breath,
in dirt and squalor.

00:35:42.050 --> 00:35:46.815
The beautiful and the rich
receive it from the unbeautiful

00:35:46.815 --> 00:35:48.989
and from the poor."
 

00:35:48.989 --> 00:35:52.293
I think we're a million miles
away from La

00:35:52.293 --> 00:35:54.469
Boh�me.
 

00:35:54.469 --> 00:35:58.480
In any case,
the idea then was to frighten

00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:02.489
people in order to reform their
habits.

00:36:02.489 --> 00:36:06.780
And these associations produced
pamphlets.

00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:08.599
They sponsored lectures.
 

00:36:08.599 --> 00:36:10.789
There were traveling exhibits.
 

00:36:10.789 --> 00:36:14.373
Later on there were films and
radio broadcasts,

00:36:14.373 --> 00:36:16.010
newspaper articles.
 

00:36:16.010 --> 00:36:21.960
And the propaganda blanketed
schools and hospitals,

00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:26.510
offices and shops,
factories, town halls,

00:36:26.510 --> 00:36:29.931
billing places,
public squares,

00:36:29.931 --> 00:36:34.331
city walls,
bulletin boards at schools and

00:36:34.331 --> 00:36:35.639
universities.
 

00:36:35.639 --> 00:36:39.943
And particular targets were the
habit of spitting and

00:36:39.943 --> 00:36:41.018
alcoholism.
 

00:36:41.018 --> 00:36:44.460
You would've noted,
not too many years ago,

00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:51.739
that if you boarded a bus,
say in Paris or in Rome,

00:36:51.739 --> 00:36:54.199
that the back of the bus would
have a sign

00:36:54.199 --> 00:36:56.840
D�fense de
crecher;

00:36:56.840 --> 00:36:58.369
"no spitting"
in French.

00:36:58.369 --> 00:37:01.018
Or Vietato sputare,
in Italian.

00:37:01.018 --> 00:37:05.994
Spitting was really something
that this campaign heavily

00:37:05.994 --> 00:37:07.170
focused on.
 

00:37:07.170 --> 00:37:10.583
In addition,
there were other messages:

00:37:10.583 --> 00:37:13.460
the outdoor life and exercise.
 

00:37:13.460 --> 00:37:17.414
It wasn't unrelated that this
was the time when the Scout

00:37:17.414 --> 00:37:20.380
movement gets going,
to give people outdoor

00:37:20.380 --> 00:37:23.768
experience, so that they'll be
more healthy.

00:37:23.768 --> 00:37:26.989
It sponsored playgrounds at
schools,

00:37:26.989 --> 00:37:29.909
and parks in cities and urban
areas,

00:37:29.909 --> 00:37:35.833
and also the movement funded
research in the basic sciences

00:37:35.833 --> 00:37:38.489
related to tuberculosis.
 

00:37:38.489 --> 00:37:42.681
So, that was part of this
campaign, the war on

00:37:42.681 --> 00:37:44.079
tuberculosis.
 

00:37:44.079 --> 00:37:47.239
In addition,
there were government measures.

00:37:47.239 --> 00:37:52.184
One was a campaign--I said that
a secondary way in which

00:37:52.184 --> 00:37:56.050
tuberculosis was spread was
through milk.

00:37:56.050 --> 00:38:00.949
And, so, in this period we see
the attempt to screen herds,

00:38:00.949 --> 00:38:05.679
to prevent diseased milk and
meat from reaching the market,

00:38:05.679 --> 00:38:10.942
and it was the time when the
pasteurization of milk took off

00:38:10.942 --> 00:38:12.369
as a practice.
 

00:38:12.369 --> 00:38:17.239
Tuberculosis also,
by states, municipalities and

00:38:17.239 --> 00:38:21.489
nations, was made a notifiable
disease.

00:38:21.489 --> 00:38:26.179
The pioneer here was New York
City in 1897.

00:38:26.179 --> 00:38:30.429
Manchester in England followed
suit in 1899,

00:38:30.429 --> 00:38:35.181
and then there was a cascade of
other places where physicians

00:38:35.181 --> 00:38:39.300
were obligated to report cases
to the authorities.

00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:44.012
Now, a result--this clearly is
a positive thing in that public

00:38:44.012 --> 00:38:48.494
health depends on accurate
information and you can only get

00:38:48.494 --> 00:38:51.199
information through statistics.
 

00:38:51.199 --> 00:38:55.090
So, I don't want to argue that
this was anything but positive.

00:38:55.090 --> 00:38:59.137
Except, as many positive
measures have,

00:38:59.137 --> 00:39:03.686
it also had a small undertow;
in other words,

00:39:03.686 --> 00:39:07.010
this increased the fear of the
disease.

00:39:07.010 --> 00:39:12.702
People feared being reported,
because they might lose their

00:39:12.702 --> 00:39:13.389
jobs.
 

00:39:13.389 --> 00:39:17.340
They would lose all standing in
the marriage market.

00:39:17.340 --> 00:39:21.302
They might be shunned by
anxious friends,

00:39:21.302 --> 00:39:23.880
neighbors and relatives.
 

00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:32.181
Another idea was vaccination,
and this was followed from

00:39:32.181 --> 00:39:36.271
1925--
well 1908, in particular,

00:39:36.271 --> 00:39:41.485
but especially after 1925--
with the BCG first,

00:39:41.485 --> 00:39:47.130
and vaccination with attenuated
bacteria thereafter,

00:39:47.130 --> 00:39:50.710
not with a very successful
result.

00:39:50.710 --> 00:39:53.130
But this was part of the policy
as well.

00:39:53.130 --> 00:39:58.152
And then there was mass
screening through radiology and

00:39:58.152 --> 00:40:00.849
the tuberculosis skin test.
 

00:40:00.849 --> 00:40:08.590
Well, how effective was the war
on tuberculosis with this set of

00:40:08.590 --> 00:40:12.889
tools used to combat the
disease?

00:40:12.889 --> 00:40:16.291
Interestingly,
I think one could argue that

00:40:16.291 --> 00:40:20.260
the war on tuberculosis really
gathered speed,

00:40:20.260 --> 00:40:24.289
not at the very height of the
tuberculosis epidemic,

00:40:24.289 --> 00:40:27.371
when there was the most
suffering, morbidity and

00:40:27.371 --> 00:40:28.159
mortality.
 

00:40:28.159 --> 00:40:33.440
The decline probably began
spontaneously somewhat earlier,

00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:36.639
maybe reflecting the sanitarian
movement,

00:40:36.639 --> 00:40:40.150
and improved urban living
conditions,

00:40:40.150 --> 00:40:43.789
improved wages and diet,
improved housing;

00:40:43.789 --> 00:40:46.282
things that were done
spontaneously,

00:40:46.282 --> 00:40:50.840
and led to a recession of the
disease by those sorts of means.

00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:56.632
But everyone agrees that
sanatoria and isolation did

00:40:56.632 --> 00:41:01.126
reduce infection;
that dispensaries and TB

00:41:01.126 --> 00:41:06.190
campaigning organizations
provided those at risk with

00:41:06.190 --> 00:41:09.210
means to protect themselves.
 

00:41:09.210 --> 00:41:15.016
So, they undoubtedly did have
an important effect on

00:41:15.016 --> 00:41:19.481
tuberculosis,
and we can see a decline in the

00:41:19.481 --> 00:41:24.170
disease in the early decades of
the twentieth century.

00:41:24.170 --> 00:41:31.487
But the real massive decline
began in what we might call the

00:41:31.487 --> 00:41:35.581
antibiotic era,
from 1940 to 1980,

00:41:35.581 --> 00:41:37.070
roughly.
 

00:41:37.070 --> 00:41:42.065
Here a major event,
a new magic bullet,

00:41:42.065 --> 00:41:50.349
was devised by Selman Waksman
in 1943, at Rutgers University;

00:41:50.349 --> 00:41:53.860
that is, the development of
streptomycin.

00:41:53.860 --> 00:41:56.639
And the first patient to be
treated with it,

00:41:56.639 --> 00:42:01.797
tuberculosis patient,
was 1944, when a critically ill

00:42:01.797 --> 00:42:08.313
TB patient made a full recovery,
what seemed truly a miracle

00:42:08.313 --> 00:42:08.989
cure.
 

00:42:08.989 --> 00:42:12.659
And this led,
immediately after World War II,

00:42:12.659 --> 00:42:17.101
to a confident expectation--and
we'll see this repeated in a

00:42:17.101 --> 00:42:21.315
number of different fields and
with regard to a series of

00:42:21.315 --> 00:42:24.501
diseases,
the idea that worldwide

00:42:24.501 --> 00:42:28.210
eradication was just around the
corner.

00:42:28.210 --> 00:42:33.076
And there was--in fact,
it was fueled by a constant

00:42:33.076 --> 00:42:38.820
decline, from the 1950s to the
mid-1980s in tuberculosis.

00:42:38.820 --> 00:42:43.440
In the USA, there was a
seventy-five percent decline.

00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:50.969
There were 80,000 cases in 1954;
20,000 only in 1985.

00:42:50.969 --> 00:42:57.041
And the government confidently
predicted eradication by

00:42:57.041 --> 00:43:03.788
2010--something that you know
didn't happen--and worldwide by

00:43:03.788 --> 00:43:04.800
2025.
 

00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:09.318
Unfortunately,
a troubling problem rapidly

00:43:09.318 --> 00:43:10.420
emerged.
 

00:43:10.420 --> 00:43:14.853
First there was monotherapy,
that is, streptomycin,

00:43:14.853 --> 00:43:18.313
and soon it happened,
it was discovered,

00:43:18.313 --> 00:43:22.570
that bacteria were becoming
resistant to it.

00:43:22.570 --> 00:43:26.324
For a time the problem was
overcome by combination

00:43:26.324 --> 00:43:30.143
treatments;
two, three medications at once,

00:43:30.143 --> 00:43:32.329
instead of monotherapy.
 

00:43:32.329 --> 00:43:40.139
Isoniazid was developed in
1952, rifampicin in 1963.

00:43:40.139 --> 00:43:45.478
But then the problem increased
with multiple-drug-resistant

00:43:45.478 --> 00:43:46.860
tuberculosis.
 

00:43:46.860 --> 00:43:51.106
And in 1985,
there was a halt in the

00:43:51.106 --> 00:43:55.849
decline;
1986 and '7 a slight rise;

00:43:55.849 --> 00:44:00.978
and after 1987,
a rise in the United States,

00:44:00.978 --> 00:44:07.300
but even more troubling,
a pandemic in Eastern Europe,

00:44:07.300 --> 00:44:12.309
Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan
Africa.

00:44:12.309 --> 00:44:15.945
Indeed, in 1993,
the World Health Organization

00:44:15.945 --> 00:44:18.951
took the step,
for the first time,

00:44:18.951 --> 00:44:23.329
of proclaiming the TB pandemic
a world emergency,

00:44:23.329 --> 00:44:28.070
and warned that the disease
might spiral out of control.

00:44:28.070 --> 00:44:33.057
Today there are perhaps
worldwide some 8,000,000 people

00:44:33.057 --> 00:44:38.137
who develop active infections
every year, and a million,

00:44:38.137 --> 00:44:40.909
over a million people die.
 

00:44:40.909 --> 00:44:44.876
Well, what are some of the
factors in this resurgent

00:44:44.876 --> 00:44:45.809
emergency?
 

00:44:45.809 --> 00:44:48.289
One, of course, is poverty.
 

00:44:48.289 --> 00:44:53.840
Tuberculosis thrives in the
conditions promoted by poverty,

00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:58.139
and worldwide the nations with
the highest incidence of TB,

00:44:58.139 --> 00:45:02.646
not by accident,
are those with the lowest gross

00:45:02.646 --> 00:45:04.469
national product.
 

00:45:04.469 --> 00:45:07.858
If we look at the United
States, we can confirm this

00:45:07.858 --> 00:45:10.726
picture,
in that seventy percent of

00:45:10.726 --> 00:45:15.248
cases in the United States occur
among racial and ethnic

00:45:15.248 --> 00:45:18.500
minorities;
forty percent among immigrants

00:45:18.500 --> 00:45:22.079
from abroad,
or what we might call marginal

00:45:22.079 --> 00:45:26.931
groups: intravenous drug users,
prisoners, the homeless,

00:45:26.931 --> 00:45:30.420
people in nursing homes for the
elderly,

00:45:30.420 --> 00:45:36.639
or people with compromised
immune systems due to HIV/AIDS.

00:45:36.639 --> 00:45:41.108
Remember, of course,
that in an era of air travel

00:45:41.108 --> 00:45:46.789
our country isn't an island and
can't reduce its own burden of

00:45:46.789 --> 00:45:51.260
tuberculosis without also
dealing with the global

00:45:51.260 --> 00:45:52.750
emergency.
 

00:45:52.750 --> 00:45:57.188
There were other factors that
have fed into this upsurge:

00:45:57.188 --> 00:46:01.864
the displacement of people due
to war, or economic disaster,

00:46:01.864 --> 00:46:04.559
or environmental catastrophes.
 

00:46:04.559 --> 00:46:08.005
Remember, of course,
that refugee camps are

00:46:08.005 --> 00:46:11.369
wonderful for propagating
tuberculosis.

00:46:11.369 --> 00:46:18.175
And then there's the HIV/AIDS
pandemic, and the upsurge in

00:46:18.175 --> 00:46:19.369
malaria.
 

00:46:19.369 --> 00:46:23.483
Both of those diseases are
immunosuppressive,

00:46:23.483 --> 00:46:28.530
and both act as powerful
substrata for the emergence of

00:46:28.530 --> 00:46:30.119
tuberculosis.
 

00:46:30.119 --> 00:46:35.237
Indeed, TB is the leading
immediate cause of death among

00:46:35.237 --> 00:46:36.820
AIDS sufferers.
 

00:46:36.820 --> 00:46:41.800
Tuberculosis is the perfect
opportunistic disease.

00:46:41.800 --> 00:46:46.409
Then there's the problem of the
emergence of drug resistance

00:46:46.409 --> 00:46:50.550
that we referred to,
and that has fed the pandemic.

00:46:50.550 --> 00:46:54.820
High rates of incarceration
feed the pandemic;

00:46:54.820 --> 00:46:57.900
that's been clearly
demonstrated in Russia,

00:46:57.900 --> 00:47:01.570
the former Soviet Union,
and in our own country.

00:47:01.570 --> 00:47:04.943
And in Russia,
the collapse of medical

00:47:04.943 --> 00:47:07.590
services in Eastern Europe.
 

00:47:07.590 --> 00:47:11.914
And then, of course,
there's the availability of

00:47:11.914 --> 00:47:13.570
mass air travel.
 

00:47:13.570 --> 00:47:20.297
Well I just wanted to close
with the fact that we're then in

00:47:20.297 --> 00:47:24.289
the midst of this world
pandemic.

00:47:24.289 --> 00:47:28.543
And I wanted to say also that
there are a number of issues

00:47:28.543 --> 00:47:31.978
about tuberculosis,
historically and medically,

00:47:31.978 --> 00:47:34.739
that still need to be worked
out.

00:47:34.739 --> 00:47:39.311
It's not understood what
factors cause it to pass from

00:47:39.311 --> 00:47:43.018
the dormant state to an active
infection.

00:47:43.018 --> 00:47:49.103
It's not known why in some
people it's a fulminant disease,

00:47:49.103 --> 00:47:53.300
but in others a slow,
wasting process.

00:47:53.300 --> 00:47:57.965
It's not known why it chooses
to invade certain tissues and

00:47:57.965 --> 00:48:00.300
organs, rather than others.
 

00:48:00.300 --> 00:48:04.648
It's not really clear why in
the middle decades of the

00:48:04.648 --> 00:48:08.586
nineteenth century it
disproportionately affected

00:48:08.586 --> 00:48:11.567
women,
whereas from the late

00:48:11.567 --> 00:48:15.820
nineteenth century it tended to
favor men.

00:48:15.820 --> 00:48:20.534
And it's not entirely clear
what were the factors that

00:48:20.534 --> 00:48:25.782
caused this major recession of
the disease between the 1890s

00:48:25.782 --> 00:48:29.081
and 1985;
although we've dealt with quite

00:48:29.081 --> 00:48:32.400
a number of them:
spontaneous economic advance;

00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:34.460
improvement in living
conditions;

00:48:34.460 --> 00:48:40.230
government and NGO campaigns;
the reporting of the disease;

00:48:40.230 --> 00:48:43.873
the sanatorium movement;
and then finally the

00:48:43.873 --> 00:48:46.230
development of antibiotics.
 

00:48:46.230 --> 00:48:50.208
So, that's the tuberculosis
story, from the age of

00:48:50.208 --> 00:48:53.539
consumption down to where we are
today;

00:48:53.539 --> 00:48:58.682
which today we find ourselves
in a very problematic condition

00:48:58.682 --> 00:49:03.313
with regard to what has been
this terrible upsurge of a

00:49:03.313 --> 00:49:07.942
disease that defeated the
confident expectation that it

00:49:07.942 --> 00:49:10.599
would soon be eradicated.
 

00:49:10.599 --> 00:49:16.000

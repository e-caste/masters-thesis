00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:06.078
Prof: Now I've been
describing the intimate

00:00:06.078 --> 00:00:09.864
relationship between sex and
violence within the chimpanzee

00:00:09.864 --> 00:00:11.040
social system.
 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.618
This lecture,
and forever after,

00:00:13.618 --> 00:00:18.111
we shift our focus to humans,
and we want to ask what's

00:00:18.111 --> 00:00:22.520
stayed pretty much the same and
what has changed.

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.855
Today I'm going to discuss two
topics, one: war in humans which

00:00:26.855 --> 00:00:30.491
hasn't changed all that much,
you can certainly see a

00:00:30.491 --> 00:00:31.540
continuity.
 

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:36.540
Then I'm going to talk about
fecundity in humans,

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.059
how many children we bear
compared to chimpanzees and

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.260
you'll see there's a very big
difference there.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:52.546
The most obvious similarity and
one that gets the public quite

00:00:52.546 --> 00:00:55.320
excited is the similarity in--
 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:39.992
violent death has always been
very important aspect for humans

00:01:39.992 --> 00:01:42.702
especially--
well all the time,

00:01:42.702 --> 00:01:47.681
but I'm going to talk now about
what's called 'primitive times,'

00:01:47.681 --> 00:01:52.105
and this is data from a tribe
that's in Paraguay in South

00:01:52.105 --> 00:01:56.611
America in the period just
before it had real contact with

00:01:56.611 --> 00:01:58.349
Western people.
 

00:01:58.349 --> 00:02:02.040
So it has nothing to do with
modernity;

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.129
this is apparently the way they
lived for time immemorial.

00:02:07.129 --> 00:02:12.039
What this table does is list
the number of deaths by age,

00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:15.460
putting them in different age
groups.

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:19.502
Here are just children or we
would call them infants almost,

00:02:19.502 --> 00:02:20.530
0 to 3 years.
 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.539
You can notice there's a
significant amount of death;

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:26.697
this is all illnesses;
that's communicable diseases

00:02:26.697 --> 00:02:30.268
and all kinds of other diseases;
that's the percentage of deaths

00:02:30.268 --> 00:02:33.574
from that,
and then there's other causes:

00:02:33.574 --> 00:02:36.940
congenital, degenerative,
accidents some,

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.830
but here's violence--
various forms of violence.

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:47.990
56% of infants from 0 to 3 died
because of violence.

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:57.619
Here is children age 4 to 14
and again we see that all

00:02:57.619 --> 00:03:03.251
illnesses, about 15%,
accidents.

00:03:03.251 --> 00:03:06.340
Violence 74%.
 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.471
Now adults during--this is a 45
year period, the number of years

00:03:11.471 --> 00:03:15.788
in the periods are not equal,
and here is illness 28%,

00:03:15.788 --> 00:03:20.282
not insignificant;
accident, not insignificant,

00:03:20.282 --> 00:03:24.046
but the various forms of
violent deaths:

00:03:24.046 --> 00:03:29.550
46%, and it's only when you get
over 60 years of age--

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:33.229
so in each of those three age
categories violent deaths have

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:35.348
been the dominant form of death.
 

00:03:35.348 --> 00:03:39.172
It's separated by males and
females, males/females total,

00:03:39.172 --> 00:03:43.336
and that's true for males and
for females, I'm showing you the

00:03:43.336 --> 00:03:44.360
sum totals.
 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:49.115
It's only even after age 60
violent death is still the

00:03:49.115 --> 00:03:51.913
dominant cause,
a third of deaths,

00:03:51.913 --> 00:03:54.740
but it's the only age at which
it isn't --

00:03:54.740 --> 00:04:01.818
at least half of the deaths,
only when you get that old.

00:04:01.818 --> 00:04:08.772
It's quite striking how
significant violent death is in

00:04:08.772 --> 00:04:11.218
human demography.
 

00:04:11.218 --> 00:04:14.045
Several things should be
noticed there,

00:04:14.045 --> 00:04:17.617
that communicable diseases are
less important for

00:04:17.617 --> 00:04:20.523
hunter/gatherers;
these are very primitive

00:04:20.523 --> 00:04:22.089
hunter/gatherers,
the Ache.

00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:27.841
One of your readings is from
their own description of the way

00:04:27.841 --> 00:04:32.060
they live and the dangers that
they face--

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:35.348
that communicable diseases are
less important because the

00:04:35.348 --> 00:04:37.170
population density is so low.
 

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:40.254
Later we'll see--and so
diseases just don't get to pass

00:04:40.254 --> 00:04:40.769
around.
 

00:04:40.769 --> 00:04:44.077
We'll see later that the
influence of diseases rises

00:04:44.077 --> 00:04:46.451
drastically,
especially among infants,

00:04:46.451 --> 00:04:49.702
when the population density
gets high enough so that people

00:04:49.702 --> 00:04:52.870
pass around--
disease is quite common.

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:54.870
Another thing you may notice
from this,

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:59.709
that more individuals die in
the first 3 years of infancy,

00:04:59.709 --> 00:05:06.350
131 deaths than in the 45 years
of adulthood 126 deaths.

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:11.692
So deaths in infancy are
50--per year are 15 times as

00:05:11.692 --> 00:05:14.980
common as deaths in adulthood.
 

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:21.386
Of 383 people who are cataloged
here, only seven people died of

00:05:21.386 --> 00:05:22.420
old age.
 

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:29.028
All of them had other really
identifiable causes.

00:05:29.028 --> 00:05:32.250
Given this background of the
significance of violence,

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:34.759
and this includes more than
just war,

00:05:34.759 --> 00:05:36.569
but does not include deaths
from animals--

00:05:36.569 --> 00:05:39.629
being eaten by animals which is
considered an accident.

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:52.093
Defining war,
going back to--we talked a lot

00:05:52.093 --> 00:05:55.134
about chimp--
you might call chimp war and

00:05:55.134 --> 00:05:59.726
now talk about human wars,
let's take a definition of war

00:05:59.726 --> 00:06:04.701
as the intentional killing of
members of one group by members

00:06:04.701 --> 00:06:06.360
of another group.
 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:09.956
The killing is done because
they are members of a group not

00:06:09.956 --> 00:06:13.057
because of any prior or
particular conflict between

00:06:13.057 --> 00:06:14.050
individuals.
 

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:17.870
It's a group thing that
determines that the two sides

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:20.810
that they're going to kill each
other.

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:24.583
The human social system in
primitive times and in some

00:06:24.583 --> 00:06:28.497
politically correct circles,
you're not supposed to use the

00:06:28.497 --> 00:06:31.968
word 'primitive,' but I use it
in its original sense of living

00:06:31.968 --> 00:06:35.043
closer to the way humans did
millions-- thousands--many

00:06:35.043 --> 00:06:37.319
thousands or millions of years
ago.

00:06:37.319 --> 00:06:40.920
It's an early form of being
human.

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:45.793
During that time we lived in
small tribal groups and they're

00:06:45.793 --> 00:06:49.351
multi-male groups,
(again we talked about most

00:06:49.351 --> 00:06:52.860
mammal's solitary males) with
strong male bonding,

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:56.019
competition for status,
lots of inter-group conflict,

00:06:56.019 --> 00:06:58.829
competition for females and
violence against females.

00:06:58.829 --> 00:07:03.949
Everything that we know says
that humans have lived in

00:07:03.949 --> 00:07:08.781
communities with those
characteristics since as far

00:07:08.781 --> 00:07:12.807
back as we can --
know, and that is the same

00:07:12.807 --> 00:07:16.189
description you would apply to
chimpanzees.

00:07:16.189 --> 00:07:21.418
The archeological data shows
that through early farming times

00:07:21.418 --> 00:07:25.689
we lived in these small
dispersed settlements,

00:07:25.689 --> 00:07:29.324
and the average size seemed to
be in the same range as current

00:07:29.324 --> 00:07:31.470
chimpanzees, about 40
individuals.

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:35.132
Size of communities range but
when you dig up these--the

00:07:35.132 --> 00:07:38.863
archeologists dig up these old
settlement they're in that

00:07:38.863 --> 00:07:39.730
ballpark.
 

00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:43.867
The anthropologists studying
currently alive people again

00:07:43.867 --> 00:07:48.598
find that the smallest organized
group of humans is a politically

00:07:48.598 --> 00:07:53.180
autonomous group consisting of
20 to 50 individuals with a head

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:53.920
man.
 

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:58.577
They call this--the proper
anthropological term is a band,

00:07:58.577 --> 00:08:02.990
again, basically the same size
as a chimp community.

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:06.266
Among chimpanzees,
as I've described to you,

00:08:06.266 --> 00:08:09.850
inter-group violence is a
hit-and-run affair.

00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:12.365
With a small group of chimps
from one community,

00:08:12.365 --> 00:08:15.418
patrol their boundary;
they detect an isolated

00:08:15.418 --> 00:08:18.954
individual, a very small group,
or even better,

00:08:18.954 --> 00:08:24.028
a single individual in another
community, and then they attack.

00:08:24.028 --> 00:08:29.396
Anthropologists tell us that
primitive warfare has exactly

00:08:29.396 --> 00:08:31.939
the same characteristics.
 

00:08:31.939 --> 00:08:36.107
Among current primitive groups
the commonest form of combat is

00:08:36.107 --> 00:08:40.450
called raids and ambushes,
and communities are constantly

00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:44.979
engaging in this hit and run--
these hit and run raids on each

00:08:44.979 --> 00:08:48.888
other and they spring ambushes
to catch lone members of the

00:08:48.888 --> 00:08:49.899
other group.
 

00:08:49.899 --> 00:08:53.769
I lived for a while among
headhunters in Borneo.

00:08:53.769 --> 00:08:55.873
Presumably they weren't
headhunters anymore at that

00:08:55.873 --> 00:08:57.772
time,
and it was perfectly acceptable

00:08:57.772 --> 00:09:00.443
for them to go out and find a
child from a neighboring

00:09:00.443 --> 00:09:02.979
community--
same tribe, same everything,

00:09:02.979 --> 00:09:06.357
but the neighboring community--
playing by the river,

00:09:06.357 --> 00:09:09.424
catch him and take off his
skull and they had their

00:09:09.424 --> 00:09:12.538
attics--
were decorated with skulls.

00:09:12.538 --> 00:09:14.961
None of this was big--that
whole community fighting that

00:09:14.961 --> 00:09:17.113
whole community,
but little raids finding

00:09:17.113 --> 00:09:19.663
individuals,
didn't matter if it was child,

00:09:19.663 --> 00:09:23.278
adult,
nothing mattered like that.

00:09:23.278 --> 00:09:30.607
You can draw many similarities
between the chimp organization

00:09:30.607 --> 00:09:35.860
of this lethal raiding and human
warfare.

00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:37.879
How does one think about this?
 

00:09:37.879 --> 00:09:39.788
Well there are two
possibilities.

00:09:39.788 --> 00:09:43.517
Either whatever you think of
the chimp warfare and the causes

00:09:43.517 --> 00:09:47.119
of it you have to think that a
lot of that is still causing

00:09:47.119 --> 00:09:52.716
human warfare,
or you can say as many utopians

00:09:52.716 --> 00:09:54.779
do,
that they're different.

00:09:54.779 --> 00:09:57.413
That human--human warfare has
nothing to do with chimp

00:09:57.413 --> 00:09:57.908
warfare.
 

00:09:57.908 --> 00:10:02.798
One of the ways to prove or
disprove that would be to look

00:10:02.798 --> 00:10:05.582
in history,
as far as we can tell,

00:10:05.582 --> 00:10:09.254
and if it has different causes,
what you have to assume is,

00:10:09.254 --> 00:10:11.509
we know for sure that this is
what chimps do,

00:10:11.509 --> 00:10:14.075
and we presume that their
ancestors some millions of years

00:10:14.075 --> 00:10:16.544
ago before we split--
did that, but we don't really

00:10:16.544 --> 00:10:19.196
know that,
but we presume it's true that

00:10:19.196 --> 00:10:22.883
chimps did that and then
sometime in human history we

00:10:22.883 --> 00:10:26.500
have to find a period where we
stopped doing it.

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:30.014
Then at a later period we
started doing it again but now

00:10:30.014 --> 00:10:33.592
for a totally different set of
reasons than for the chimp

00:10:33.592 --> 00:10:34.360
reasons.
 

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:37.658
The strategy of trying to
figure out this question is then

00:10:37.658 --> 00:10:41.014
to go back in history and gather
the archaeological and the

00:10:41.014 --> 00:10:43.960
anthropological--
whatever data we can gather,

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:46.803
and try to find out:
has there been a period in

00:10:46.803 --> 00:10:49.029
human history where we were
not--

00:10:49.029 --> 00:10:52.820
did not have this
inter-communal violence.

00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:59.950
The people who believe that war
has different causes --

00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:04.460
they think agriculture started
it because land becomes valuable

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:07.080
or private property of some
sort,

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:09.058
people wanted to get each
other's private property,

00:11:09.058 --> 00:11:12.610
or governments,
modern state governments,

00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:15.067
or very commonly you'll hear
that it has something to do with

00:11:15.067 --> 00:11:18.294
modernity,
that civilization has somehow

00:11:18.294 --> 00:11:23.779
corrupted the pure nature of
early humans who were wonderful

00:11:23.779 --> 00:11:27.220
human beings and didn't go to
war.

00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:29.379
What was the situation for
prehistoric humans?

00:11:29.379 --> 00:11:31.950
We can go back to the
Neanderthals,

00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:38.048
which are a sister subspecies,
and these guys as you know--

00:11:38.048 --> 00:11:41.023
heavy musculature,
robust bones--they were

00:11:41.023 --> 00:11:43.200
obviously strong characters.
 

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:48.496
When you take--study their
graveyards, 40% of Neanderthal

00:11:48.496 --> 00:11:51.429
skeletons have head injuries.
 

00:11:51.429 --> 00:11:54.990
How does one attribute that?
 

00:11:54.990 --> 00:11:58.746
Either they were very clumsy
and accident prone and always

00:11:58.746 --> 00:12:01.450
somehow managed to fall on their
head--

00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:04.037
so far as we know they didn't
climb trees very much and hang

00:12:04.037 --> 00:12:07.446
upside down and fall,
or there was a lot of club

00:12:07.446 --> 00:12:10.710
wielding and head bashing going
on.

00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:12.955
Homo sapiens,
not Neanderthals,

00:12:12.955 --> 00:12:17.446
the earliest human burials that
haven't just decayed away are

00:12:17.446 --> 00:12:22.236
about 20,000 to 35,000 years ago
and when you dig them up what do

00:12:22.236 --> 00:12:23.360
you find?
 

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:28.123
Spear points embedded in the
bones, cranial fractures,

00:12:28.123 --> 00:12:30.908
scalping marks,
and so forth.

00:12:30.908 --> 00:12:33.808
These burial grounds are found
wherever archeologists look.

00:12:33.808 --> 00:12:37.504
Some of the most prominent ones
are Italy, France,

00:12:37.504 --> 00:12:42.029
Egypt, Czechoslovakia because
that's where archeologists have

00:12:42.029 --> 00:12:43.690
had access to dig.
 

00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:49.070
At a 13,000 year old cemetery
in Sudan, over 40% of the

00:12:49.070 --> 00:12:54.548
skeletons had spear or arrow
points embedded in them.

00:12:54.548 --> 00:12:57.821
The wounds--there were children
buried there--the wounds found

00:12:57.821 --> 00:13:00.556
from the children in the
cemetery were all execution

00:13:00.556 --> 00:13:02.379
shots in the head or the neck.
 

00:13:02.379 --> 00:13:07.860
They were just bashed to death
in the head or the neck.

00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:10.924
This was not like one burial
from one horrific incident,

00:13:10.924 --> 00:13:13.100
it was used over several
generations.

00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:16.990
It was a continuing cemetery,
and many of the adults showed

00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:20.813
not only the wounds that caused
their death but many prior

00:13:20.813 --> 00:13:23.610
wounds,
bone cracks and skull cracks

00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:26.677
that had healed,
so you can see both a wound

00:13:26.677 --> 00:13:30.515
from some prior conflict which
had healed and the new wound

00:13:30.515 --> 00:13:33.230
which caused the death at this
moment.

00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:36.551
Individuals had gotten into a
lot of conflict:

00:13:36.551 --> 00:13:39.428
one skeleton had 20 different
wounds.

00:13:39.428 --> 00:13:45.465
That means bone cracks that you
could still see 13,000 years

00:13:45.465 --> 00:13:51.398
later, and soft tissue injury we
just don't have any way of

00:13:51.398 --> 00:13:53.240
knowing about.
 

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:55.990
When you get to modern times,
still prehistoric,

00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:59.178
meaning before we have any
written records--

00:13:59.178 --> 00:14:01.678
before anything you'd call
civilization--

00:14:01.678 --> 00:14:05.149
things get a little stylized,
that clearly culture is

00:14:05.149 --> 00:14:05.950
advancing.
 

00:14:05.950 --> 00:14:10.629
There's a middle Stone Age cave
in Germany, only 5,000 to 10,000

00:14:10.629 --> 00:14:14.120
years old, where there are two
caches of skulls,

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:16.350
just the skulls are there.
 

00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:20.418
They're neatly arranged like
eggs in a basket,

00:14:20.418 --> 00:14:22.220
and they are the disembodied
heads of men,

00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:25.740
women, and children with
multiple heads--

00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:30.110
multiple holes not by axes into
their skulls.

00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:33.119
I don't have--they didn't show
a picture of that,

00:14:33.119 --> 00:14:35.440
but this is a modern version of
it.

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:41.340
This is actually from Thailand;
this is the way skulls can get

00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:42.820
arranged.
 

00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:48.607
This--that picture has a
totally different kind of

00:14:48.607 --> 00:14:49.788
purpose.
 

00:14:49.788 --> 00:14:51.158
How many of you remember ice
man?

00:14:51.158 --> 00:14:54.320
The guy that got unfrozen from
the Alps;

00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:55.519
you're all aware of this.
 

00:14:55.519 --> 00:15:01.011
In 1991, one of the glaciers in
the Alps disgorged this Stone

00:15:01.011 --> 00:15:05.590
Age man who had died they think
5,300 years ago.

00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:09.952
As at least a good number of
you know, he had a lot of press

00:15:09.952 --> 00:15:12.320
and he was called the ice man.
 

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:15.490
Since it took 5,300 years for
him to come down the mountain,

00:15:15.490 --> 00:15:19.648
he must have died pretty high
up in some high point of the

00:15:19.648 --> 00:15:24.797
pass in the mountain,
so it was just assumed that he

00:15:24.797 --> 00:15:27.981
died--
froze to death--while trying to

00:15:27.981 --> 00:15:32.765
cross the Alps and got encased
in the ice and 5,000 years later

00:15:32.765 --> 00:15:33.769
came down.
 

00:15:33.769 --> 00:15:39.258
For ten years academic opinion
said that, and then they finally

00:15:39.258 --> 00:15:43.330
got around to taking a CAT scan
of the body.

00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:44.480
Guess what they found?
 

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:48.827
A two centimeter flint
arrowhead had ripped through his

00:15:48.827 --> 00:15:52.613
scapula and lodged six
centimeters deep into his

00:15:52.613 --> 00:15:53.658
shoulder.
 

00:15:53.658 --> 00:15:57.081
He had been shot from behind by
an arrow and he died of internal

00:15:57.081 --> 00:15:57.679
bleeding.
 

00:15:57.679 --> 00:16:01.070
Again, a violent death.
 

00:16:01.070 --> 00:16:04.860
You come to even more recent
times,

00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:09.265
a Native American settlement,
American Indians from about

00:16:09.265 --> 00:16:13.080
1325 A.D.,
so almost 200 years before they

00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:16.230
have any contact with
westerners,

00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:19.557
and this contains the remains
of 500 men, women,

00:16:19.557 --> 00:16:20.620
and children.
 

00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:25.558
This is not a great picture,
but again,

00:16:25.558 --> 00:16:29.330
what you see that these victims
had been scalped,

00:16:29.330 --> 00:16:32.090
mutilated, and then something a
little unique,

00:16:32.090 --> 00:16:37.250
left exposed for a few months
to scavengers before being

00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:40.216
buried,
again, as a form of punishment,

00:16:40.216 --> 00:16:41.850
disrespect, or whatever.
 

00:16:41.850 --> 00:16:44.840
For the victim you not only
slaughter them,

00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:47.201
mutilate them,
maybe mutilate and then

00:16:47.201 --> 00:16:49.921
slaughter them,
and then you leave the

00:16:49.921 --> 00:16:54.279
scavengers to chew on them and
then finally they get buried.

00:16:54.279 --> 00:16:58.535
In short, archeology documents
warfare in every well-studied

00:16:58.535 --> 00:17:02.432
region for the past 10,000
years, which is when we have

00:17:02.432 --> 00:17:04.019
very good records.
 

00:17:04.019 --> 00:17:06.660
That's what you can dig up.
 

00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:12.981
The other thing is to look at
currently primitive human beings

00:17:12.981 --> 00:17:17.750
and ask how many of them are
truly peaceful.

00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:22.210
The anthropologists now take
over from the archeologists.

00:17:22.210 --> 00:17:26.412
What the anthropologists find
is that 90% to 95% of known

00:17:26.412 --> 00:17:30.838
societies have been involved in
war that we can document.

00:17:30.838 --> 00:17:35.660
One sample of 50 societies,
45 engaged in war frequently;

00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:40.188
4 did not engage in war because
they had recently been driven

00:17:40.188 --> 00:17:42.828
into isolated refuges by
warfare.

00:17:42.828 --> 00:17:48.826
Have any of you been to the
Aymara Indians in Lake Titicaca

00:17:48.826 --> 00:17:49.859
in Peru?
 

00:17:49.859 --> 00:17:51.150
It's a big tourist spot.
 

00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:53.184
There's an island in the middle
of Lake Titicaca,

00:17:53.184 --> 00:17:55.390
and they're very peaceful
people, they live on reeds,

00:17:55.390 --> 00:17:56.960
they don't have anybody to
fight.

00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:59.721
They were pushed off the
mainland by war and they've just

00:17:59.721 --> 00:18:03.289
been isolated,
so that's one of the groups

00:18:03.289 --> 00:18:09.356
that's-- well we haven't seen
them get into any wars but they

00:18:09.356 --> 00:18:12.288
have no possibility of it.
 

00:18:12.288 --> 00:18:14.220
One which is called 'peaceful,'
the Moonachie,

00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:16.986
which live actually in the
Sierra Nevada Mountains of

00:18:16.986 --> 00:18:20.450
California they say--
we'll call them peaceful

00:18:20.450 --> 00:18:23.808
because they only rarely go to
war.

00:18:23.808 --> 00:18:27.756
In another study 66% of
primitive societies went to war

00:18:27.756 --> 00:18:31.336
every year,
75% at least every two years,

00:18:31.336 --> 00:18:36.538
and up to 90% went to war at
least once every five years,

00:18:36.538 --> 00:18:41.490
so the evidence is mounting up
that so called primitive humans

00:18:41.490 --> 00:18:44.250
are not a terribly peaceful lot.
 

00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:48.265
The Dani tribes of New Guinea
had seven full battles and nine

00:18:48.265 --> 00:18:51.210
raids in one five and a half
month period.

00:18:51.210 --> 00:18:54.574
Some anthropologists was
sitting there for five and half

00:18:54.574 --> 00:18:57.450
months and that's the number
that he counted.

00:18:57.450 --> 00:19:01.776
One Yanomamo Village,
that's in Venezuela,

00:19:01.776 --> 00:19:05.470
was raided 25 times in 15
months.

00:19:05.470 --> 00:19:09.835
In the U.S. West,
86% of the Indian tribes went

00:19:09.835 --> 00:19:15.150
raiding or had to resist raids
at least once a year.

00:19:15.150 --> 00:19:18.318
Now you come to groups that are
usually peaceful,

00:19:18.318 --> 00:19:22.272
so there's a group in Malaysia
called the Semais and they were

00:19:22.272 --> 00:19:24.262
recruited so--
but during World War II,

00:19:24.262 --> 00:19:27.209
as you know,
the Japanese took Malaysia,

00:19:27.209 --> 00:19:32.696
and the British incited a sort
of guerilla movement against the

00:19:32.696 --> 00:19:36.183
Japanese;
so they were retained as scouts

00:19:36.183 --> 00:19:38.140
by the British to fight.
 

00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:42.588
I'm sorry this was later--this
was--they've--they were scouts

00:19:42.588 --> 00:19:46.890
to fight the guerilla insurgency
by supposed communists.

00:19:46.890 --> 00:19:50.300
Eventually some of the
guerillas killed a few of the

00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:52.318
Semais,
a few of their kinsmen,

00:19:52.318 --> 00:19:55.782
and then even though they had
never been known to be warlike

00:19:55.782 --> 00:19:57.720
they become extremely warlike.
 

00:19:57.720 --> 00:20:01.162
One Semai veteran recalled,
"We killed,

00:20:01.162 --> 00:20:04.285
killed, killed,
the Malays would rob the

00:20:04.285 --> 00:20:07.247
corpses, but we did not want
anything.

00:20:07.247 --> 00:20:09.890
We thought only of killing.
 

00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:10.368
Wah!
 

00:20:10.368 --> 00:20:14.930
Truly we were drunk with
blood."

00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:17.788
It sounds like their culture,
like many cultures,

00:20:17.788 --> 00:20:21.598
have repressed the killing
instinct,

00:20:21.598 --> 00:20:24.950
or killing propensity for one
reason or another,

00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:27.710
and then when the cultural
controls came off,

00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:31.670
boom, the instinct just roars
up, totally full blown,

00:20:31.670 --> 00:20:33.670
almost instantaneously.
 

00:20:33.670 --> 00:20:36.108
We've seen that in so many
cases.

00:20:36.108 --> 00:20:40.536
In Yugoslavia recently where
people lived together for a very

00:20:40.536 --> 00:20:43.929
long time in moderate harmony,
all of a sudden,

00:20:43.929 --> 00:20:46.880
bang, they start killing each
other.

00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:51.769
The Germans in the 19--before
the Depression in the 1920s--

00:20:51.769 --> 00:20:54.298
were among the most civilized
people on earth in science,

00:20:54.298 --> 00:20:57.556
and education,
boom, they become savages

00:20:57.556 --> 00:20:59.308
almost immediately.
 

00:20:59.308 --> 00:21:02.839
I think the indication is
there's something inside of us

00:21:02.839 --> 00:21:04.058
ready to pop out.
 

00:21:04.058 --> 00:21:07.565
Culture can repress it,
but demagogues know how to

00:21:07.565 --> 00:21:11.285
stick their finger into
populations and pull out that

00:21:11.285 --> 00:21:14.003
us/them and vilify the
"them"

00:21:14.003 --> 00:21:17.509
and bring us right back to
chimpanzee days.

00:21:17.509 --> 00:21:21.957
You all know Yale has a center
for study of the Cambodian

00:21:21.957 --> 00:21:25.182
genocide,
where now one group of people,

00:21:25.182 --> 00:21:29.346
the Cambodians,
sort of split into two and the

00:21:29.346 --> 00:21:31.650
slaughter was terrible.
 

00:21:31.650 --> 00:21:35.400
How many of you have seen the
movie The Killing Fields?

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:38.558
How many of you know about the
Cambodian genocide?

00:21:38.558 --> 00:21:41.200
Again, most of you,
but not all of you;

00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:45.420
it's one of the most recent,
most horrific kinds of killing.

00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:51.060
This killing is--can be--what
basically happens is that one

00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:55.730
group does not consider another
group humans,

00:21:55.730 --> 00:21:57.259
and if you look in primitive
languages,

00:21:57.259 --> 00:22:01.048
very often the word for human
is the same as the word for

00:22:01.048 --> 00:22:03.618
their group whatever their group
is.

00:22:03.618 --> 00:22:07.932
In the American Indians that
was also a common kind of

00:22:07.932 --> 00:22:08.990
phenomenon.
 

00:22:08.990 --> 00:22:14.212
There's a good report from
March 18,1690 in Salmon Falls,

00:22:14.212 --> 00:22:18.317
New Hampshire,
where a girl named Mercy Short

00:22:18.317 --> 00:22:19.250
lived.
 

00:22:19.250 --> 00:22:22.130
They were raided by the Abenaki
Indians;

00:22:22.130 --> 00:22:26.598
that was at that time 1690,
a real frontier town.

00:22:26.598 --> 00:22:30.851
Mercy saw them kill her parents
and three of her brothers and

00:22:30.851 --> 00:22:31.558
sisters.
 

00:22:31.558 --> 00:22:34.555
She was taken to--on a long
winter march to Canada,

00:22:34.555 --> 00:22:37.608
and the captors sort of dragged
her up to Canada.

00:22:37.608 --> 00:22:41.285
During that March she saw a
five year old boy chopped to

00:22:41.285 --> 00:22:43.093
bits,
a young girl scalped,

00:22:43.093 --> 00:22:46.732
and was forced to watch with
her hands tied as another fellow

00:22:46.732 --> 00:22:49.645
captive was stripped,
bound to a stake,

00:22:49.645 --> 00:22:53.023
and tortured with fire,
after which the Abenaki

00:22:53.023 --> 00:22:55.500
"danced about him and at
every turn,

00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:59.500
they did with their knives cut
collops of his flesh,

00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:03.227
from his naked limbs,
and throw them with his blood

00:23:03.227 --> 00:23:04.420
into his face.
 

00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:07.269
Remember this is someone who is
already a captive with his hands

00:23:07.269 --> 00:23:08.990
tied so there's no immediate
threat.

00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:14.548
It's a clear sign of just not
considering these out-group

00:23:14.548 --> 00:23:16.930
individuals as humans.
 

00:23:16.930 --> 00:23:23.078
All chimpanzees have one set of
morals toward an in-group,

00:23:23.078 --> 00:23:25.835
and as I've told you,
that in the wild the male/male

00:23:25.835 --> 00:23:29.239
conflicts never result in death
nor do the male/female conflicts

00:23:29.239 --> 00:23:34.045
within a group,
but in an out-group if possible

00:23:34.045 --> 00:23:37.529
they always result in death.
 

00:23:37.529 --> 00:23:39.640
Now what does one think of this?
 

00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:45.480
There's a very interesting
story from early America,

00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:50.108
it's actually Amerigo Vespucci,
after whom America is named,

00:23:50.108 --> 00:23:53.269
and you know Columbus
discovered America in 1492.

00:23:53.269 --> 00:23:57.157
Ten years later they were
exploring all around and

00:23:57.157 --> 00:24:01.839
Vespucci went on a--one of the
exploration expeditions along

00:24:01.839 --> 00:24:04.298
the coast of South America.
 

00:24:04.298 --> 00:24:08.976
He had some interactions with
the local tribe's people and had

00:24:08.976 --> 00:24:11.200
some interpreters on board.
 

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:14.929
Columbus had brought some
natives back to Europe,

00:24:14.929 --> 00:24:18.970
and they were able to do some
kind of translation.

00:24:18.970 --> 00:24:22.516
He was very interested in how
different they were from

00:24:22.516 --> 00:24:23.318
Europeans.
 

00:24:23.318 --> 00:24:26.840
"Their marriages are not
with one woman but with as many

00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:29.605
as they like,
and without much ceremony,

00:24:29.605 --> 00:24:33.818
meaning they just get married
very causally and we have known

00:24:33.818 --> 00:24:36.910
someone who had ten women
married to him.

00:24:36.910 --> 00:24:41.056
They are a very prolific
people, , but they have no heirs

00:24:41.056 --> 00:24:43.868
because they hold no
property."

00:24:43.868 --> 00:24:49.199
Even childbirth is without
pain, "Women in parturition

00:24:49.199 --> 00:24:52.598
do not use any ceremony as ours
do.

00:24:52.598 --> 00:24:55.640
They eat everything,
go on the same day to the

00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:59.487
fields and wash themselves;
it seems that they hardly feel

00:24:59.487 --> 00:25:01.058
their parturition."
 

00:25:01.058 --> 00:25:05.726
Parturition--giving birth--now
you can see that what he's

00:25:05.726 --> 00:25:10.393
dealing with in the 1500s,
the late renaissance attitude,

00:25:10.393 --> 00:25:12.808
political science theory.
 

00:25:12.808 --> 00:25:15.813
What is it that causes wars
between societies,

00:25:15.813 --> 00:25:18.150
which they had lots of back
then.

00:25:18.150 --> 00:25:24.411
One of the issues is original
sin, these are very religious

00:25:24.411 --> 00:25:30.887
people, and what was the major
punishment for Eve's eating of

00:25:30.887 --> 00:25:32.400
the apple?
 

00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:35.480
Pain in childbirth,
severe pain in childbirth;

00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:38.433
here were some people that had
no pain in childbirth,

00:25:38.433 --> 00:25:40.308
and he waxes poetic about that.
 

00:25:40.308 --> 00:25:43.519
Were they absolved of original
sin?

00:25:43.519 --> 00:25:46.990
That's the kind of issue that's
in his mind.

00:25:46.990 --> 00:25:50.525
He also says,
"They are people who lived

00:25:50.525 --> 00:25:52.883
many years,
and according to their

00:25:52.883 --> 00:25:56.192
succession, we have known many
men who have four generations

00:25:56.192 --> 00:25:57.088
living."
 

00:25:57.088 --> 00:25:59.730
So that's about 80 years--what
is he referring to here?

00:25:59.730 --> 00:26:03.221
Again, from the Bible;
the span of life,

00:26:03.221 --> 00:26:05.210
what's the span of life?
 

00:26:05.210 --> 00:26:09.102
70 years, very hard to fit four
generations into that,

00:26:09.102 --> 00:26:13.141
so again, he's reflecting that
these are not people like

00:26:13.141 --> 00:26:14.608
European people.
 

00:26:14.608 --> 00:26:17.954
He goes on with all the wonders
of their civilization,

00:26:17.954 --> 00:26:21.490
or their un-civilization
whatever you want to call it.

00:26:21.490 --> 00:26:24.779
But, he says,
"They are a warlike

00:26:24.779 --> 00:26:27.670
people,
and when they fight they do so

00:26:27.670 --> 00:26:30.627
very cruelly,
and that side which is lord of

00:26:30.627 --> 00:26:33.108
the battlefield bury their own
dead,

00:26:33.108 --> 00:26:36.500
but the enemy dead they cut up
and eat.

00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:42.048
One of their men confessed to
me that he had eaten the flesh

00:26:42.048 --> 00:26:45.058
of more than 200 bodies."
 

00:26:45.058 --> 00:26:48.565
Continuing, Vespucci talking,
"The most astonishing

00:26:48.565 --> 00:26:52.260
thing about their wars and
cruelty is that we could find no

00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:55.976
reason for them,
since they have no property or

00:26:55.976 --> 00:26:58.758
lords,
or kings, or desire for

00:26:58.758 --> 00:27:02.948
plunder, or lust to rule,
which seems to me to be the

00:27:02.948 --> 00:27:05.048
causes of war and
disorder."

00:27:05.048 --> 00:27:08.588
Again straight late renaissance
theory and political science

00:27:08.588 --> 00:27:09.130
theory.
 

00:27:09.130 --> 00:27:13.204
"When we asked them to
tell us the cause of the war and

00:27:13.204 --> 00:27:17.073
disorder they could give no
other reason except that this

00:27:17.073 --> 00:27:21.423
war began among them a long time
ago and they wish to avenge the

00:27:21.423 --> 00:27:23.980
death of their ancestors."
 

00:27:23.980 --> 00:27:30.390
It's a very interesting
passage, the Indians--

00:27:30.390 --> 00:27:33.625
Vespucci's idea is that
original sin is what causes this

00:27:33.625 --> 00:27:37.400
and then political--
the sins that humans do have

00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:42.346
the lust for power,
etc., is what causes all these

00:27:42.346 --> 00:27:48.210
wars and none of that fits these
South American Indians.

00:27:48.210 --> 00:27:51.775
The same message,
that -- it's not obvious what

00:27:51.775 --> 00:27:56.029
the cause of these wars is,
comes from modern anthropology,

00:27:56.029 --> 00:27:59.703
so the Yanomamo of Venezuela
and Brazil who are very violent

00:27:59.703 --> 00:28:02.715
people,
there was a book called The

00:28:02.715 --> 00:28:05.740
Fierce People that describes
them.

00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:07.778
They're very, very warlike.
 

00:28:07.778 --> 00:28:10.740
They're in that border between
Venezuela and Brazil;

00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:14.329
they're involved in almost
constant warfare and yet what

00:28:14.329 --> 00:28:15.440
are they after?
 

00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:18.163
Yanomamo villages are
surrounded by abundant

00:28:18.163 --> 00:28:19.618
unoccupied territory.
 

00:28:19.618 --> 00:28:22.342
They're just not settlement,
to settlement,

00:28:22.342 --> 00:28:24.934
to settlement,
there's plenty of space in

00:28:24.934 --> 00:28:26.750
which they could expand.
 

00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:28.528
Napoleon Chagnon,
who you may have heard of,

00:28:28.528 --> 00:28:31.058
the anthropologist who studies
the Yanomamo,

00:28:31.058 --> 00:28:34.852
believes that the fighting
between them was apparently

00:28:34.852 --> 00:28:39.358
motivated only by desires to
exact revenge and capture women.

00:28:39.358 --> 00:28:43.890
We seem to have come across
this before,

00:28:43.890 --> 00:28:47.429
but again, just as in
chimpanzees, in primitive

00:28:47.429 --> 00:28:51.969
warfare females are killed as
often as they are captured and

00:28:51.969 --> 00:28:56.737
most of these primitive tribes,
as well as modern people's,

00:28:56.737 --> 00:29:01.009
have difficulty getting food,
not as a cause of war but as a

00:29:01.009 --> 00:29:02.000
result of war.
 

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.252
Things get so disrupted by war,
that's the reason they have

00:29:06.252 --> 00:29:07.940
trouble getting food.
 

00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:12.222
All of this is archeological
and anthropological,

00:29:12.222 --> 00:29:17.397
studying times or peoples who
don't have really any writing

00:29:17.397 --> 00:29:18.380
system.
 

00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:21.798
So in a sense it's prehistoric.
 

00:29:21.798 --> 00:29:30.104
Once we come to writing,
the record of violence flows

00:29:30.104 --> 00:29:32.660
hot and heavy.
 

00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:35.694
The first account of the
exploits of mortals is our

00:29:35.694 --> 00:29:36.970
military histories.
 

00:29:36.970 --> 00:29:39.873
The earliest writing of the
Chinese, of the Greeks,

00:29:39.873 --> 00:29:42.253
of the Romans,
are concerned with wars and

00:29:42.253 --> 00:29:43.298
warrior kings.
 

00:29:43.298 --> 00:29:47.525
Most Mayan hieroglyphic texts
are devoted to the genealogies,

00:29:47.525 --> 00:29:50.343
biographies,
and military exploits of the

00:29:50.343 --> 00:29:51.470
Mayan kings.
 

00:29:51.470 --> 00:29:54.394
The earliest Egyptian
hieroglyphics record the

00:29:54.394 --> 00:29:56.930
victories of Egypt's first
Pharaoh's.

00:29:56.930 --> 00:30:02.250
The first secular literature
written in cuneiform recounts

00:30:02.250 --> 00:30:06.730
the adventures of the warrior
king, Gilgamesh.

00:30:06.730 --> 00:30:09.922
The early and extreme
warlikeness of the earliest

00:30:09.922 --> 00:30:12.650
civilizations is laid out in the
Bible.

00:30:12.650 --> 00:30:16.328
You just read the Bible and you
get the whole message I'm giving

00:30:16.328 --> 00:30:16.680
you.
 

00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:20.733
The earliest written part of
the Old Testament,

00:30:20.733 --> 00:30:25.670
Exodus, recounts the brutal
Hebrew conquest of Canaan.

00:30:25.670 --> 00:30:30.923
Numbers 31:7-18,
The Israelites get the Ten

00:30:30.923 --> 00:30:32.799
Commandments.
 

00:30:32.799 --> 00:30:34.410
Thou shalt not kill.
 

00:30:34.410 --> 00:30:37.727
And then they go off to conquer
Canaan with lots and lots of

00:30:37.727 --> 00:30:38.288
killing.
 

00:30:38.288 --> 00:30:41.380
They waged war against the
Midianites as the Lord--

00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:44.830
this is one of my favorite
passages: "They waged war

00:30:44.830 --> 00:30:48.344
against the Midianites as the
Lord had commanded Moses and

00:30:48.344 --> 00:30:51.962
killed every male among them,
but the Israelites kept the

00:30:51.962 --> 00:30:54.502
women of the Midianites with
their children as

00:30:54.502 --> 00:30:55.519
captives."
 

00:30:55.519 --> 00:30:58.117
When Moses learned about this,
the captains came back,

00:30:58.117 --> 00:31:00.568
thumped their chests,
we've had a great victory;

00:31:00.568 --> 00:31:03.027
we've killed all the men and
here we have the women and

00:31:03.027 --> 00:31:05.255
children as captives,
Moses becomes angry:

00:31:05.255 --> 00:31:07.470
"So you've spared all the
women,

00:31:07.470 --> 00:31:11.810
why they are the very ones who
prompted the unfaithfulness of

00:31:11.810 --> 00:31:14.200
the Israelites toward the Lord.
 

00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:18.528
Slay therefore every male child
and every woman who has had

00:31:18.528 --> 00:31:22.606
intercourse with a man,
but you may spare and keep for

00:31:22.606 --> 00:31:26.452
yourselves all girls who have
had no intercourse with a

00:31:26.452 --> 00:31:27.380
man."
 

00:31:27.380 --> 00:31:32.414
An echo of the chimpanzees who,
when a female tries to transfer

00:31:32.414 --> 00:31:35.420
if she has children she's a
goner,

00:31:35.420 --> 00:31:37.200
if she's young,
presumably a virgin,

00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:40.960
then she will probably be
allowed to transfer.

00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:43.019
After the fall of Jericho the
Israelites,

00:31:43.019 --> 00:31:45.923
quote, "Put to the sword
all living creatures of the

00:31:45.923 --> 00:31:48.223
city,
men, women, young and old,

00:31:48.223 --> 00:31:52.298
as well as oxen,
sheep and asses."

00:31:52.298 --> 00:31:57.276
Next they attacked Ai,
"there fell that day a

00:31:57.276 --> 00:32:02.759
total of 12,000 men and women,
the entire population of

00:32:02.759 --> 00:32:04.078
Ai."
 

00:32:04.078 --> 00:32:05.723
The clear thing,
it's quite striking how this

00:32:05.723 --> 00:32:07.368
comes so soon after the Ten
Commandments,

00:32:07.368 --> 00:32:10.368
that what's clearly going on
is, just as chimps--

00:32:10.368 --> 00:32:12.031
is an in-group,
and clearly the Ten

00:32:12.031 --> 00:32:14.692
Commandments is --
intended for the in-group,

00:32:14.692 --> 00:32:17.538
'thou shalt not kill,' straight
chimpanzee.

00:32:17.538 --> 00:32:21.423
However, out-groups,
if you don't kill them all

00:32:21.423 --> 00:32:24.798
you're not obeying God's
commandments.

00:32:24.798 --> 00:32:32.660
In very modern times atrocities
continue with no lessening of

00:32:32.660 --> 00:32:39.471
the horrific nature of it
compared to chimps or early

00:32:39.471 --> 00:32:44.075
human beings,
and I'll describe one famous

00:32:44.075 --> 00:32:48.299
event to you which--
how many of you know about the

00:32:48.299 --> 00:32:49.740
rape of Nanking?
 

00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:52.808
Again, not all of you,
all of you should know these

00:32:52.808 --> 00:32:55.940
things that I refer to are very
important things.

00:32:55.940 --> 00:32:59.259
This is during World War II in
I think it was 1937.

00:32:59.259 --> 00:33:01.970
The Japanese were trying to
conquer China,

00:33:01.970 --> 00:33:04.613
and it was a big place and they
were getting rather frustrated

00:33:04.613 --> 00:33:06.503
because--
in Japan it's a small place,

00:33:06.503 --> 00:33:09.516
in China it's a huge place,
and it's not an easy thing to

00:33:09.516 --> 00:33:09.730
do.
 

00:33:09.730 --> 00:33:15.984
But they captured a city called
Nanking, south of the Yangtze

00:33:15.984 --> 00:33:16.818
River.
 

00:33:16.818 --> 00:33:20.817
In short order,
the Japanese slaughtered

00:33:20.817 --> 00:33:22.558
350,000 people.
 

00:33:22.558 --> 00:33:26.781
The total population of Nanking
at the time was only about

00:33:26.781 --> 00:33:30.930
650,000 and several hundred
thousand had already fled.

00:33:30.930 --> 00:33:34.192
In short, they basically killed
every Chinese that they could

00:33:34.192 --> 00:33:36.967
find, just like the Bible
stories, or the chimpanzee

00:33:36.967 --> 00:33:37.618
stories.
 

00:33:37.618 --> 00:33:41.238
A Japanese newspaper reporter
watched Chinese prisoners being

00:33:41.238 --> 00:33:43.650
bayoneted on the top of the city
wall.

00:33:43.650 --> 00:33:46.388
"One by one,
prisoners fell down into the

00:33:46.388 --> 00:33:49.595
outside of the wall,
blood splattered everywhere,

00:33:49.595 --> 00:33:53.142
the chilling atmosphere made
one's hair stand on end and

00:33:53.142 --> 00:33:55.269
limbs tremble with fear."
 

00:33:55.269 --> 00:33:58.230
This reporter is talking only
from Japanese and we'll see,

00:33:58.230 --> 00:34:01.170
Nazi sources because it's
possible the Chinese sources may

00:34:01.170 --> 00:34:05.063
be exaggerated or something,
but the belief is that neither

00:34:05.063 --> 00:34:09.039
the Japanese nor the Nazi
sources would exaggerate.

00:34:09.039 --> 00:34:11.478
Another Japanese military
correspondent,

00:34:11.478 --> 00:34:14.728
even more constrained,
described another locale where

00:34:14.728 --> 00:34:17.980
the murders were by
samurai-style decapitations.

00:34:17.980 --> 00:34:21.242
"Those in the second row
were forced to dump the severed

00:34:21.242 --> 00:34:24.559
bodies into the river before
they themselves were beheaded.

00:34:24.559 --> 00:34:28.257
The killing went on nonstop
from morning until night,

00:34:28.257 --> 00:34:32.309
but they were only able to kill
2,000 persons that way.

00:34:32.309 --> 00:34:34.711
The next day,
tired of killing in this

00:34:34.711 --> 00:34:37.050
fashion, they set up machine
guns.

00:34:37.050 --> 00:34:41.154
So great was the slaughter that
the Japanese general complained

00:34:41.154 --> 00:34:45.257
that he could not find ditches
deep enough to bury the enormous

00:34:45.257 --> 00:34:46.980
pile of corpses."
 

00:34:46.980 --> 00:34:49.739
Tens of thousands of Chinese
women were raped,

00:34:49.739 --> 00:34:53.233
often in schools and nunneries,
thousands more were put into

00:34:53.233 --> 00:34:56.733
sexual slavery,
forced into prostitution,

00:34:56.733 --> 00:35:01.409
and referred to in Japanese as
public toilets,

00:35:01.409 --> 00:35:04.809
the women forced into
prostitutions.

00:35:04.809 --> 00:35:08.735
Many soldiers went beyond rape
to disembowel women,

00:35:08.735 --> 00:35:12.820
slice off their breasts,
nail them alive to walls.

00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:16.027
Fathers were forced to rape
their daughters and sons their

00:35:16.027 --> 00:35:18.079
mothers;
not only did live burials,

00:35:18.079 --> 00:35:21.460
castration, and the carving of
organs and roasting of people

00:35:21.460 --> 00:35:24.061
become routine,
but more diabolical tortures

00:35:24.061 --> 00:35:27.030
were practiced like hanging
people from their tongues on

00:35:27.030 --> 00:35:29.925
iron hooks,
or burying people to their

00:35:29.925 --> 00:35:34.739
waists and watch them being torn
apart by German Shepherds.

00:35:34.739 --> 00:35:39.543
So sickening was the spectacle
that even the Nazi's in the city

00:35:39.543 --> 00:35:40.860
were horrified.
 

00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:44.432
When the Japanese took
Singapore, right after Pearl

00:35:44.432 --> 00:35:47.791
Harbor, they shot and
decapitated another 20,000

00:35:47.791 --> 00:35:48.650
Chinese.
 

00:35:48.650 --> 00:35:53.219
That was just a modern example
to show you that whatever this

00:35:53.219 --> 00:35:57.561
is in humans that makes us want
to kill members of another

00:35:57.561 --> 00:35:59.931
group,
it is totally unfettered by

00:35:59.931 --> 00:36:03.050
anything that you might call
control or civilization,

00:36:03.050 --> 00:36:07.940
when it breaks out the violence
is just incredible.

00:36:07.940 --> 00:36:12.804
The bottom line is that war
seems to be characteristic of

00:36:12.804 --> 00:36:17.929
almost all, and possibly all
human societies at all times in

00:36:17.929 --> 00:36:19.320
our history.
 

00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:22.643
There is no example,
no period which we can find

00:36:22.643 --> 00:36:24.744
out,
where there's a discontinuity

00:36:24.744 --> 00:36:28.010
between the chimpanzee behavior
and our current behavior,

00:36:28.010 --> 00:36:32.512
and so again,
I think whatever you think of

00:36:32.512 --> 00:36:36.480
what's causing the chimpanzee
war,

00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:41.184
you probably have to consider
very much the same explanation

00:36:41.184 --> 00:36:42.460
for human war.
 

00:36:42.460 --> 00:36:46.610
The amount of death--I showed
you one example from one tribe,

00:36:46.610 --> 00:36:50.253
the Ache in South America,
and any one tribe's experience

00:36:50.253 --> 00:36:52.530
may or may not be
characteristic.

00:36:52.530 --> 00:36:54.929
This is from a book,
Lawrence Keeley,

00:36:54.929 --> 00:36:58.664
War Before Civilization,
which traces a lot of the

00:36:58.664 --> 00:37:01.199
information I've been giving
you,

00:37:01.199 --> 00:37:04.514
and what he does is,
he collects all the data that

00:37:04.514 --> 00:37:09.007
anybody's ever collected,
so that he sort of can get some

00:37:09.007 --> 00:37:12.530
idea of the percentages of
deaths by war.

00:37:12.530 --> 00:37:15.320
This is percent of deaths from
warfare--

00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:18.679
this is males,
and this is everybody together,

00:37:18.679 --> 00:37:23.099
and these are different tribes
at different tribes for whom we

00:37:23.099 --> 00:37:23.969
have data.
 

00:37:23.969 --> 00:37:27.822
You'll see that the
numbers--the male numbers go up

00:37:27.822 --> 00:37:31.829
to 50% or 60% of male deaths are
from these wars,

00:37:31.829 --> 00:37:34.800
and the deaths of everybody
which is this,

00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:37.789
is somewhat smaller,
a fifth or a sixth,

00:37:37.789 --> 00:37:44.119
15% to 20% of deaths,
but going up of course to 40%

00:37:44.119 --> 00:37:45.639
of deaths.
 

00:37:45.639 --> 00:37:49.000
The point he's trying to make
with this graph is,

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:53.869
here's primitive warfare,
these darkly colored bands,

00:37:53.869 --> 00:37:58.094
what he calls primitive
warfare, and the white bands are

00:37:58.094 --> 00:38:02.550
so called civilizations and he
calls civilizations anything

00:38:02.550 --> 00:38:06.612
that has a state,
like the Aztecs had a state in

00:38:06.612 --> 00:38:08.750
one of these it is Aztecs.
 

00:38:08.750 --> 00:38:13.110
From the data that one has we
are--

00:38:13.110 --> 00:38:16.664
even though we think of World
War II and all of these current

00:38:16.664 --> 00:38:20.280
and incredible wars and all our
technology devoted to war--

00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:24.750
what's happening is that we
have much--

00:38:24.750 --> 00:38:29.177
many, many more people die then
did in the past but the

00:38:29.177 --> 00:38:34.096
population of humans has grown
so much that the percentage is

00:38:34.096 --> 00:38:37.300
not so huge,
and that wars are less frequent.

00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:40.632
Rather than having raids almost
continuously as in a lot of

00:38:40.632 --> 00:38:43.806
primitive warfare,
we have wars every 15 or 20

00:38:43.806 --> 00:38:48.034
years or so in general between
any two groups fighting each

00:38:48.034 --> 00:38:48.690
other.
 

00:38:48.690 --> 00:38:52.152
What he shows,
again, from the data that has

00:38:52.152 --> 00:38:57.150
large and unknown error bars--
the civilized warfare which is

00:38:57.150 --> 00:39:00.217
the Aztecs,
France in the nineteenth

00:39:00.217 --> 00:39:03.880
century with Napoleonic War,
the 1870 War,

00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:08.177
Western Europe in the
seventeenth century lots and

00:39:08.177 --> 00:39:10.990
lots of wars in the 1600s,
U.S.

00:39:10.990 --> 00:39:12.719
and Europe in the twentieth
century,

00:39:12.719 --> 00:39:15.010
World War I and World War II
and so forth,

00:39:15.010 --> 00:39:20.976
that as far as he can tell the
fraction of all deaths that is

00:39:20.976 --> 00:39:23.960
caused by war is decreasing.
 

00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:28.277
One possible very nice way of
looking at human history is that

00:39:28.277 --> 00:39:31.179
humans have some sort of a
propensity,

00:39:31.179 --> 00:39:35.103
call it an instinct if you
like, to identify an in-group

00:39:35.103 --> 00:39:37.530
and everyone else is out-groups.
 

00:39:37.530 --> 00:39:39.724
These in groups can be
nationality, they can be

00:39:39.724 --> 00:39:42.590
religion, they can be color of
skin, they can be language.

00:39:42.590 --> 00:39:46.699
Language is a big source of
conflict in Canada and Belgium,

00:39:46.699 --> 00:39:49.530
all kinds of places;
almost anything will do.

00:39:49.530 --> 00:39:53.849
It can be Yale versus Harvard,
or Berkeley College versus

00:39:53.849 --> 00:39:56.010
Calhoun College,
and Red Sox,

00:39:56.010 --> 00:39:57.630
the Red Sox fans.
 

00:39:57.630 --> 00:39:59.588
The English who are generally
very civilized,

00:39:59.588 --> 00:40:02.349
get into a soccer stadium and
they start killing each other.

00:40:02.349 --> 00:40:06.927
Humans have this enormous
desire to identify in-group and

00:40:06.927 --> 00:40:07.909
out-group.
 

00:40:07.909 --> 00:40:12.030
We even now pay to advertise a
company,

00:40:12.030 --> 00:40:14.119
because anything that looks
like a group membership symbol,

00:40:14.119 --> 00:40:18.025
humans love that,
and will pay a lot to have a

00:40:18.025 --> 00:40:22.929
hat or a name of some team,
or even some company on them.

00:40:22.929 --> 00:40:28.224
We have very different morals
towards the in-group and the

00:40:28.224 --> 00:40:29.340
out-group.
 

00:40:29.340 --> 00:40:36.181
It seems that that's what's
still going on in us,

00:40:36.181 --> 00:40:41.170
that as time--we have that
still.

00:40:41.170 --> 00:40:43.378
But as time goes on,
because of increased

00:40:43.378 --> 00:40:46.362
communication and increased
education, probably what we

00:40:46.362 --> 00:40:48.130
consider the in-group grows.
 

00:40:48.130 --> 00:40:51.496
First it was your little
village, a little hamlet of 40

00:40:51.496 --> 00:40:53.782
people,
and then maybe organized into

00:40:53.782 --> 00:40:57.280
some sort of a tribe of 1,000
people and gradually it grows.

00:40:57.280 --> 00:40:59.336
If you read the history of
Europe there are all these

00:40:59.336 --> 00:41:01.878
little cities,
say Greece with city-states,

00:41:01.878 --> 00:41:04.949
a whole city could be
considered one family,

00:41:04.949 --> 00:41:07.659
with a lot of divisions within
it.

00:41:07.659 --> 00:41:11.407
Renaissance Italy you have the
Medici's and the Pazzi killing

00:41:11.407 --> 00:41:15.219
each other, families within
cities, but gradually it grows.

00:41:15.219 --> 00:41:17.800
You get nation states,
and as they grow,

00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:20.777
the wars get less because
people within say France don't

00:41:20.777 --> 00:41:22.889
generally have wars with each
other,

00:41:22.889 --> 00:41:25.150
but France will have a huge war
with Germany.

00:41:25.150 --> 00:41:27.527
The group that people consider
"us"

00:41:27.527 --> 00:41:29.889
gets larger,
the frequency of war goes down,

00:41:29.889 --> 00:41:32.889
but since you have so many
people fighting so many people,

00:41:32.889 --> 00:41:36.530
the war causes more and more
deaths.

00:41:36.530 --> 00:41:39.536
Possibly, this is optimistic,
that as we become more

00:41:39.536 --> 00:41:42.896
interconnected and we consider
more people "us,"

00:41:42.896 --> 00:41:44.842
and fewer people
"them,"

00:41:44.842 --> 00:41:47.789
that gradually this behavior
will disappear.

00:41:47.789 --> 00:41:52.349
But that's just guess work.
 

00:41:52.349 --> 00:41:56.536
Now Keeley, who gathered a lot
of this data,

00:41:56.536 --> 00:41:58.969
he has his own summary.
 

00:41:58.969 --> 00:42:02.634
Again, in frustration about not
really understanding …

00:42:02.634 --> 00:42:07.228
what these wars are all about,
he does not accept any idea

00:42:07.228 --> 00:42:10.570
that there's any biology
involved.

00:42:10.570 --> 00:42:13.487
He says, since he can
occasionally find some group

00:42:13.487 --> 00:42:17.001
that hasn't been to war for 20
years or something like that,

00:42:17.001 --> 00:42:18.730
then it can't be biology.
 

00:42:18.730 --> 00:42:22.166
The view of biology that many
social sciences have is sort of

00:42:22.166 --> 00:42:25.030
that --….--if it's
biology, it's a knee jerk

00:42:25.030 --> 00:42:25.659
reflex.
 

00:42:25.659 --> 00:42:28.681
If you're not--if your nervous
system is not impaired,

00:42:28.681 --> 00:42:32.273
every time I hit your knee with
a hammer your knee will kick out

00:42:32.273 --> 00:42:33.869
and there's no volition.
 

00:42:33.869 --> 00:42:38.150
They say if we ever see a human
not doing some behavior,

00:42:38.150 --> 00:42:41.110
that behavior cannot be
instinctual.

00:42:41.110 --> 00:42:46.173
Of course that was disproven in
around 1910 by Pavlov,

00:42:46.173 --> 00:42:48.849
you all know about Pavlov?
 

00:42:48.849 --> 00:42:51.869
He takes an instinct as basic
as eating,

00:42:51.869 --> 00:42:55.360
and a dog sees a piece of meat
and starts salivating,

00:42:55.360 --> 00:42:58.536
and then very rapidly he rings
a bell a minute before the dog

00:42:58.536 --> 00:43:01.610
sees the meat and the dog starts
salivating to the bell.

00:43:01.610 --> 00:43:07.822
Since 1910 at least we've known
that even the most basic

00:43:07.822 --> 00:43:14.597
behavior can be controlled by
something with as small a brain

00:43:14.597 --> 00:43:17.503
as a dog,
even though one would never say

00:43:17.503 --> 00:43:19.340
the dog does not have an eating
instinct,

00:43:19.340 --> 00:43:21.070
does not have a salivating
instinct,

00:43:21.070 --> 00:43:24.190
of course they do and yet dogs
can control it.

00:43:24.190 --> 00:43:28.690
I tell a story about my dog,
so a smallish white Samoyed,

00:43:28.690 --> 00:43:30.780
and I'm at work all day.
 

00:43:30.780 --> 00:43:33.744
I work long hours and so she's
at home all day and by the time

00:43:33.744 --> 00:43:35.690
I come home she's a little
frustrated.

00:43:35.690 --> 00:43:38.400
She's been cooped up,
and I'm a little frustrated.

00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:42.137
So what happens:
I get down on my hands and

00:43:42.137 --> 00:43:44.539
knees and I growl at her.
 

00:43:44.539 --> 00:43:49.179
She immediately picks up the
cue, she's snarling back at me,

00:43:49.179 --> 00:43:52.469
and then I swat her one,
a gentle swat but she gets--

00:43:52.469 --> 00:43:55.349
she snips back at my hand and
we go at it.

00:43:55.349 --> 00:43:56.550
We have a great time.
 

00:43:56.550 --> 00:44:00.889
Unfortunately my dog has died,
but we had a great time and in

00:44:00.889 --> 00:44:03.639
the course of these she's
snapping--

00:44:03.639 --> 00:44:07.090
she's aroused,
her hair is standing on end,

00:44:07.090 --> 00:44:10.909
her tail is straight up,
her fangs are showed,

00:44:10.909 --> 00:44:14.750
and she's snapping away at me
and I get,

00:44:14.750 --> 00:44:20.110
maybe--we do 20 minutes or so
maybe--

00:44:20.110 --> 00:44:24.750
at least 50 to 100 bites where
she actually wins.

00:44:24.750 --> 00:44:28.407
I win, I smack her,
she wins and--so what that

00:44:28.407 --> 00:44:33.286
means over the years I've had
many tens of thousands of times

00:44:33.286 --> 00:44:36.619
where she's grabbed me and all
that,

00:44:36.619 --> 00:44:39.413
and guess what,
not once in all those many

00:44:39.413 --> 00:44:42.820
thousands of bites has she ever
pierced my skin.

00:44:42.820 --> 00:44:44.780
All right, this is a peaceful
house dog;

00:44:44.780 --> 00:44:46.889
she doesn't know anything about
killing.

00:44:46.889 --> 00:44:48.340
No, not true.
 

00:44:48.340 --> 00:44:51.159
In the morning I take her out
running in the woods,

00:44:51.159 --> 00:44:53.079
I don't know if she takes me or
I take her,

00:44:53.079 --> 00:44:57.179
and if she sees a bird or a
squirrel,

00:44:57.179 --> 00:45:01.579
she's off and she comes back
with a dead bird in her mouth,

00:45:01.579 --> 00:45:03.052
clearly killed,
she clearly bit through their

00:45:03.052 --> 00:45:04.496
skin--
very, very proud,

00:45:04.496 --> 00:45:06.989
walking there with a dead
squirrel.

00:45:06.989 --> 00:45:08.829
Here's an animal and I love her
dearly,

00:45:08.829 --> 00:45:13.826
but her brain is not very big,
and she can get into the depths

00:45:13.826 --> 00:45:18.413
of real instinctual responses
and yet her brain is clever

00:45:18.413 --> 00:45:22.099
enough to be able to control it
and not--

00:45:22.099 --> 00:45:26.822
and to kill the squirrel but
not to kill me or not even break

00:45:26.822 --> 00:45:28.239
through my skin.
 

00:45:28.239 --> 00:45:31.400
I think the idea is a lot of
people think when you've

00:45:31.400 --> 00:45:35.230
described biological basis for
behavior that it's inevitable.

00:45:35.230 --> 00:45:38.969
The human species were lost,
we're never going to change,

00:45:38.969 --> 00:45:40.440
but that's nonsense.
 

00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:43.010
Humans are like chimpanzees,
we're quite intelligent,

00:45:43.010 --> 00:45:45.030
and we are capable--we have
instinct,

00:45:45.030 --> 00:45:47.449
I believe that we have
instincts for sure,

00:45:47.449 --> 00:45:51.047
you'll see it come out in the
most horrible ways and in some

00:45:51.047 --> 00:45:54.585
good ways,
but it's not that difficult to

00:45:54.585 --> 00:45:55.409
control.
 

00:45:55.409 --> 00:45:58.940
My dog can do it,
you guys can do it.

00:45:58.940 --> 00:46:02.494
The other issue which--these
are good topics for discussion

00:46:02.494 --> 00:46:06.503
in the sections--
is, some people also say when I

00:46:06.503 --> 00:46:10.079
describe duck rape or orangutan
rape,

00:46:10.079 --> 00:46:13.873
that some of--my describing it
and saying that animals do it

00:46:13.873 --> 00:46:15.159
I'm justifying it.
 

00:46:15.159 --> 00:46:18.585
There's this whole thing now
that what's natural is good and

00:46:18.585 --> 00:46:21.719
what animals do is natural and
therefore it's good,

00:46:21.719 --> 00:46:25.190
and it slops over to foods and
everything.

00:46:25.190 --> 00:46:32.614
This whole idea of natural law,
that you can tell from nature

00:46:32.614 --> 00:46:40.039
what is good and what is bad is
not to be taken seriously.

00:46:40.039 --> 00:46:44.699
That finishes that topic,
and I think you've had enough

00:46:44.699 --> 00:46:45.650
violence.
 

00:46:45.650 --> 00:46:50.630
I want to skip--switch to the
opposite side now.

00:46:50.630 --> 00:46:52.840
Demography is,
of course, births and deaths;

00:46:52.840 --> 00:46:55.909
those are the two main things
in demography.

00:46:55.909 --> 00:46:59.373
We have been talking about one
of the main causes of human

00:46:59.373 --> 00:47:02.268
death on one side,
and we find that there is a

00:47:02.268 --> 00:47:05.210
clear continuity between
chimpanzees and humans.

00:47:05.210 --> 00:47:08.769
Now let's talk about the other
side, births and there

00:47:08.769 --> 00:47:11.166
surprisingly,
humans are drastically

00:47:11.166 --> 00:47:13.289
different from chimpanzees.
 

00:47:13.289 --> 00:47:15.469
How do we know this?
 

00:47:15.469 --> 00:47:19.449
Chimpanzees were never very
successful demographically.

00:47:19.449 --> 00:47:22.599
At their peak there may have
been two million chimpanzees.

00:47:22.599 --> 00:47:27.880
A very small Chinese city is
two million individuals,

00:47:27.880 --> 00:47:32.483
and now because of the rise of
humans they're taking over their

00:47:32.483 --> 00:47:35.101
territory,
the guess is they've been

00:47:35.101 --> 00:47:41.980
reduced to about 100,000;
5% of their peak population.

00:47:41.980 --> 00:47:43.610
They are restricted to central
Africa;

00:47:43.610 --> 00:47:47.750
they have never spread beyond
central Africa.

00:47:47.750 --> 00:47:49.880
Humans, on the other hand as
you know, number in the

00:47:49.880 --> 00:47:52.510
billions;
we've spread to the farthest

00:47:52.510 --> 00:47:57.240
corners of the earth from the
ice cap around the North Pole to

00:47:57.240 --> 00:47:59.800
the hottest desert and jungle.
 

00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:04.710
There are tens of thousands of
times as many people,

00:48:04.710 --> 00:48:08.427
humans, as there are
chimpanzees, and humans have

00:48:08.427 --> 00:48:13.000
become absolutely dominant
basically everywhere on earth.

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:16.693
From a demographic point of
view, maybe the first question

00:48:16.693 --> 00:48:19.414
we should ask,
why are there so many humans

00:48:19.414 --> 00:48:20.840
and so few chimps?
 

00:48:20.840 --> 00:48:25.789
What is the secret of our
demographic success?

00:48:25.789 --> 00:48:28.949
Let me give you a clue about
the time scale.

00:48:28.949 --> 00:48:35.065
We separated from chimps about
six million years ago,

00:48:35.065 --> 00:48:40.827
and I've shown you--this is
another version of the

00:48:40.827 --> 00:48:44.710
deaths--don't worry about it.
 

00:48:44.710 --> 00:48:48.730
Remember this--the family tree
here,

00:48:48.730 --> 00:48:53.436
and here is the split point
where humans branched off from

00:48:53.436 --> 00:48:58.061
chimps and bonobos and its
ballpark six million years ago

00:48:58.061 --> 00:48:59.880
that we split off.
 

00:48:59.880 --> 00:49:03.010
The population size,
what is believed,

00:49:03.010 --> 00:49:08.800
that the population size of
all--the group that became these

00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:14.688
three species was only about
50,000 individuals at this split

00:49:14.688 --> 00:49:15.670
point.
 

00:49:15.670 --> 00:49:22.230
That comes from the genetics,
the variation in genetics.

00:49:22.230 --> 00:49:26.643
This small group branched off
and started behaving--evolving

00:49:26.643 --> 00:49:28.139
quite differently.
 

00:49:28.139 --> 00:49:33.077
What happens when you have a
small group to begin with of

00:49:33.077 --> 00:49:37.405
50,000 breeding individuals,
then a small group breaks off

00:49:37.405 --> 00:49:40.815
and they may further subdivide
into smaller groups that may not

00:49:40.815 --> 00:49:43.070
come much in contact with each
other,

00:49:43.070 --> 00:49:46.434
you have inbreeding,
and inbreeding causes a lot of

00:49:46.434 --> 00:49:50.304
genetic problems,
but it also allows evolution to

00:49:50.304 --> 00:49:51.690
go very rapidly.
 

00:49:51.690 --> 00:49:54.230
For mutation,
if it is beneficial it appears,

00:49:54.230 --> 00:49:57.333
it can spread to a small
population very rapidly whereas

00:49:57.333 --> 00:50:00.322
it's extremely difficult for it
to spread into a large

00:50:00.322 --> 00:50:01.170
population.
 

00:50:01.170 --> 00:50:05.898
The tinyness of the number of
our human ancestors allowed a

00:50:05.898 --> 00:50:10.954
rather rapid evolution away from
the other groups who were also

00:50:10.954 --> 00:50:16.010
evolving of course because they
were also in small groups.

00:50:16.010 --> 00:50:22.768
That--at the split you start
going down this pathway and it's

00:50:22.768 --> 00:50:27.161
shown here as a single line,
but as all of you know from the

00:50:27.161 --> 00:50:28.494
newspaper,
there are many,

00:50:28.494 --> 00:50:32.364
many species splitting off at
different times with different

00:50:32.364 --> 00:50:34.989
characteristics all in the
humanoid,

00:50:34.989 --> 00:50:40.871
hominid line and by chance all
of those other species went

00:50:40.871 --> 00:50:43.039
extinct except one.
 

00:50:43.039 --> 00:50:45.737
That's another characteristic:
if you're a small group then

00:50:45.737 --> 00:50:47.179
it's very easy to go extinct.
 

00:50:47.179 --> 00:50:54.585
And all of the--we know 20,30
other humanoid species,

00:50:54.585 --> 00:50:59.429
and all went extinct except
one.

00:50:59.429 --> 00:51:01.670
The genus Homo,
which is the group of species

00:51:01.670 --> 00:51:04.012
in which we sit,
originates about two and a half

00:51:04.012 --> 00:51:06.842
million years ago,
and they start calling

00:51:06.842 --> 00:51:11.873
skeletons Homo sapiens
about a half a million years

00:51:11.873 --> 00:51:13.994
ago,
but even though they're Homo

00:51:13.994 --> 00:51:16.268
sapiens their brains are,
at that time,

00:51:16.268 --> 00:51:19.039
significantly smaller than ours
are now,

00:51:19.039 --> 00:51:24.349
and anatomically modern humans
date only from about 100,000 to

00:51:24.349 --> 00:51:26.090
150,000 years ago.
 

00:51:26.090 --> 00:51:30.110
All during this period the
number of humans was clearly

00:51:30.110 --> 00:51:31.079
very small.
 

00:51:31.079 --> 00:51:36.360
It's very humbling to realize
that with a small group that's

00:51:36.360 --> 00:51:39.472
evolving rapidly,
which means it's not yet

00:51:39.472 --> 00:51:42.010
mastered it's environment
because you don't--

00:51:42.010 --> 00:51:46.710
once you have optimized your
relationship to your environment

00:51:46.710 --> 00:51:50.132
evolution slows down,
but if we're evolving rapidly

00:51:50.132 --> 00:51:52.210
that means we haven't yet
mastered it.

00:51:52.210 --> 00:51:55.255
So a small group struggling in
its environment,

00:51:55.255 --> 00:51:58.909
very likely to go extinct;
most of our sibling species

00:51:58.909 --> 00:52:01.800
went extinct,
and I think with a very small

00:52:01.800 --> 00:52:05.971
role of the dice differently the
line towards humans could easily

00:52:05.971 --> 00:52:07.340
have gone extinct.
 

00:52:07.340 --> 00:52:13.315
It seems that about 100,000
years ago there was a bottleneck

00:52:13.315 --> 00:52:18.297
in the growth of human species,
and the humans living at that

00:52:18.297 --> 00:52:19.972
time,
a small group,

00:52:19.972 --> 00:52:24.440
were the ancestors to all
current human beings.

00:52:24.440 --> 00:52:28.237
There was a small population of
about 2,000 to 10,000 they

00:52:28.237 --> 00:52:30.454
believe,
and that the total human

00:52:30.454 --> 00:52:33.541
population,
from 2,000 to 10,000 of humans

00:52:33.541 --> 00:52:36.280
living in Africa and
interbreeding.

00:52:36.280 --> 00:52:39.592
There may have been other human
populations somewhere else that

00:52:39.592 --> 00:52:40.340
disappeared.
 

00:52:40.340 --> 00:52:43.835
We don't know,
and the numbers 2,000 to 10,000

00:52:43.835 --> 00:52:47.099
some research puts them a few
times higher,

00:52:47.099 --> 00:52:51.449
we don't really know,
but again a very small number.

00:52:51.449 --> 00:52:54.507
We know from that period that
there was no substantial

00:52:54.507 --> 00:52:57.490
population growth,
so that means the average

00:52:57.490 --> 00:53:01.882
number of surviving children was
two or maybe teensy weensy bit

00:53:01.882 --> 00:53:05.559
higher then two,
so that meant when you have on

00:53:05.559 --> 00:53:09.923
average two children per couple,
that means that most lineages

00:53:09.923 --> 00:53:13.230
have died out,
that most individuals who were

00:53:13.230 --> 00:53:17.235
living at that time of this
small number now leave no

00:53:17.235 --> 00:53:18.929
descendants at all.
 

00:53:18.929 --> 00:53:22.608
If you trace back,
the genetics suggest that all

00:53:22.608 --> 00:53:25.974
current humans,
all races all over the world

00:53:25.974 --> 00:53:29.809
are the descendants of a single
human female.

00:53:29.809 --> 00:53:33.318
That every other line,
from the time when she was

00:53:33.318 --> 00:53:36.461
alive has died out,
and similarly for males,

00:53:36.461 --> 00:53:40.409
we are all the descendants of a
single human male.

00:53:40.409 --> 00:53:44.356
All other lines have died out,
and those two didn't have to

00:53:44.356 --> 00:53:45.989
live at the same time.
 

00:53:45.989 --> 00:53:48.260
In fact, almost certainly did
not live at the same time;

00:53:48.260 --> 00:53:52.445
it's just the randomness of
lines dying out and the genetics

00:53:52.445 --> 00:53:56.277
tells us that we know the rate
at which DNA mutates and

00:53:56.277 --> 00:53:59.579
diverges and so we--
and we know the range of a

00:53:59.579 --> 00:54:03.208
variation in current humans so
we just sort of narrowed that

00:54:03.208 --> 00:54:07.514
back and it goes back to this--
what did I say 100,000 years

00:54:07.514 --> 00:54:07.909
ago.
 

00:54:07.909 --> 00:54:13.572
That's the genetic Eve and the
genetic Adam that the newspapers

00:54:13.572 --> 00:54:18.869
just love this story but it's
just a common result of --

00:54:18.869 --> 00:54:21.949
a population that doesn't have
a lot of surviving children--

00:54:21.949 --> 00:54:24.119
lines are going to die out.
 

00:54:24.119 --> 00:54:27.025
You can read that the royal
houses of Europe is where you're

00:54:27.025 --> 00:54:28.010
all exposed to it.
 

00:54:28.010 --> 00:54:31.099
Look how few generations the
royal houses last before they

00:54:31.099 --> 00:54:33.952
don't have any heirs,
and that's in modern--these are

00:54:33.952 --> 00:54:36.809
the richest people at their time
and have all the food and

00:54:36.809 --> 00:54:39.764
protection and everything that
they want and they can't stay

00:54:39.764 --> 00:54:41.920
going for more than a few
generations.

00:54:41.920 --> 00:54:47.161
In primitive times,
the rate of extinction of lines

00:54:47.161 --> 00:54:48.420
was great.
 

00:54:48.420 --> 00:54:52.369
About 50,000 years ago--we're
going to spend a few million

00:54:52.369 --> 00:54:55.489
years in Africa,
then about 50,000 years ago a

00:54:55.489 --> 00:54:58.469
group of humans migrated out of
Africa.

00:54:58.469 --> 00:55:02.427
Again, the numbers and the
times, some people say it was as

00:55:02.427 --> 00:55:05.840
late as 25,000 years ago that
they migrated out.

00:55:05.840 --> 00:55:09.797
Then amazing things happened,
once they burst out on the rest

00:55:09.797 --> 00:55:12.369
of the world,
they spread everywhere.

00:55:12.369 --> 00:55:14.840
Humans are found everywhere on
the Eurasian continent,

00:55:14.840 --> 00:55:22.590
that's from Siberia to Spain by
about 20,000 years ago,

00:55:22.590 --> 00:55:26.889
and then from Siberia they
crossing the Bering Strait,

00:55:26.889 --> 00:55:29.639
which was a land bridge at that
time,

00:55:29.639 --> 00:55:33.126
and expanded into the Americas
and reached the very tip of

00:55:33.126 --> 00:55:35.329
South America by 10,000 years
ago.

00:55:35.329 --> 00:55:40.056
In 40,000 years which is a
blink of an eye in evolutionary

00:55:40.056 --> 00:55:44.536
terms, humans spread everywhere
on earth, an incredible

00:55:44.536 --> 00:55:46.610
population explosion.
 

00:55:46.610 --> 00:55:49.585
This is the first and greatest
explosion, a population

00:55:49.585 --> 00:55:50.820
explosion of humans.
 

00:55:50.820 --> 00:55:55.184
You should note that something
was making us superior at that

00:55:55.184 --> 00:55:59.840
time, and clearly it has nothing
to do with modern technology.

00:55:59.840 --> 00:56:05.594
All of this fantastic expansion
even pre-dates the invention of

00:56:05.594 --> 00:56:11.070
agriculture and most of what we
consider civilization starts

00:56:11.070 --> 00:56:13.018
with agriculture.
 

00:56:13.018 --> 00:56:17.534
What is the main difference
that has allowed this story that

00:56:17.534 --> 00:56:21.360
humans have done this and chimps
have done this?

00:56:21.360 --> 00:56:24.911
Well you ask,
what is the reproductive rate

00:56:24.911 --> 00:56:26.349
of chimpanzees?
 

00:56:26.349 --> 00:56:30.735
Well I've told you that a chimp
mother has one young every five

00:56:30.735 --> 00:56:34.177
to eight years,
so at that rate it's going to

00:56:34.177 --> 00:56:37.539
be very hard to increase at any
great speed.

00:56:37.539 --> 00:56:40.420
Human females have babies much
more frequently,

00:56:40.420 --> 00:56:42.800
it's quite possible to have a
baby every year,

00:56:42.800 --> 00:56:46.130
or every year and a half,
or two years,

00:56:46.130 --> 00:56:51.375
and this is common--my brother
was born 20 months apart from

00:56:51.375 --> 00:56:51.820
me.
 

00:56:51.820 --> 00:56:56.719
How many of you have siblings
less than two years apart?

00:56:56.719 --> 00:56:57.750
Most of you.
 

00:56:57.750 --> 00:57:02.851
So humans are quite capable of
doing something that chimps just

00:57:02.851 --> 00:57:03.840
cannot do.
 

00:57:03.840 --> 00:57:09.034
They have a rate of
reproduction of about four or

00:57:09.034 --> 00:57:12.389
five times slower than we do.
 

00:57:12.389 --> 00:57:14.666
The mothers,
the chimp mothers cannot take

00:57:14.666 --> 00:57:16.889
care of more than one young at a
time.

00:57:16.889 --> 00:57:20.108
They will have a young that's
clinging to them and then

00:57:20.108 --> 00:57:23.563
perhaps an adolescent son or
daughter with them but they'll

00:57:23.563 --> 00:57:26.157
never--
you never see two infants at a

00:57:26.157 --> 00:57:30.659
time,
whereas, humans can easily take

00:57:30.659 --> 00:57:34.710
care of two infants at a time.
 

00:57:34.710 --> 00:57:36.179
Twins in chimps?
 

00:57:36.179 --> 00:57:41.041
I have never heard--read
anything about chimps occurring

00:57:41.041 --> 00:57:46.259
in--twins occurring in chimps,
and I don't know whether they

00:57:46.259 --> 00:57:47.320
ever do.
 

00:57:47.320 --> 00:57:50.836
It may be just that we don't
have enough observation that

00:57:50.836 --> 00:57:54.481
maybe occasionally chimp twins
do happen, but it's not been

00:57:54.481 --> 00:57:56.239
reported that I've seen.
 

00:57:56.239 --> 00:57:59.360
Anybody take a--
Student:  Not about

00:57:59.360 --> 00:58:01.637
twins, I was just going to ask
if that's regulated by hormones

00:58:01.637 --> 00:58:02.159
completely.
 

00:58:02.159 --> 00:58:06.849
Like you would say that
lactation stops--

00:58:06.849 --> 00:58:07.780
Prof: Yes.
 

00:58:07.780 --> 00:58:11.547
Student:  But it's a
chimp is nursing a baby for five

00:58:11.547 --> 00:58:12.059
years?
 

00:58:12.059 --> 00:58:13.590
Prof: They're nursing
them for a long time.

00:58:13.590 --> 00:58:17.438
I don't recall what the number
is, but there's many behavioral

00:58:17.438 --> 00:58:18.260
mechanisms.
 

00:58:18.260 --> 00:58:20.898
So in nursing,
the actual physical stimulation

00:58:20.898 --> 00:58:25.057
of the nipple releases hormones,
Oxytocin, which prevents

00:58:25.057 --> 00:58:27.940
ovulation again,
and that can be prolonged for

00:58:27.940 --> 00:58:29.960
quite a period of time but is
not absolute,

00:58:29.960 --> 00:58:32.530
so there are other behavioral
mechanisms,

00:58:32.530 --> 00:58:35.750
other internal hormonal
mechanisms which ensure this and

00:58:35.750 --> 00:58:38.025
in chimpanzees we--
it's very hard to capture a

00:58:38.025 --> 00:58:39.768
chimp and do the physiology and
experiment,

00:58:39.768 --> 00:58:45.759
so we basically probably don't
know most of the answer to that

00:58:45.759 --> 00:58:46.840
question.
 

00:58:46.840 --> 00:58:53.121
The--a major difference --
between humans and chimps is a

00:58:53.121 --> 00:58:57.719
tremendous increase in human
fecundity.

00:58:57.719 --> 00:59:01.913
Now in demography we use the
word--fecundity means the

00:59:01.913 --> 00:59:04.050
ability to have children.
 

00:59:04.050 --> 00:59:08.090
Fertility means the number of
children you actually have,

00:59:08.090 --> 00:59:10.688
and that comes from French
usage and French use the word

00:59:10.688 --> 00:59:13.570
sort of oppositely to the way we
do and demography was born in

00:59:13.570 --> 00:59:14.090
France.
 

00:59:14.090 --> 00:59:18.331
When I say fertility I don't
mean the ability to have

00:59:18.331 --> 00:59:20.317
children,
that's fecundity,

00:59:20.317 --> 00:59:23.516
but I mean the number of
children that any given set of

00:59:23.516 --> 00:59:24.880
women actually have.
 

00:59:24.880 --> 00:59:31.496
We have to ask ourselves what
evolutionary factors allowed

00:59:31.496 --> 00:59:34.630
this change in fecundity.
 

00:59:34.630 --> 00:59:40.489
What limited chimp population,
what limited chimp fecundity?

00:59:40.489 --> 00:59:45.385
Well in primate evolution the
main factor is the time that

00:59:45.385 --> 00:59:47.619
brain development takes.
 

00:59:47.619 --> 00:59:50.404
A body that's capable of
walking and chewing and so forth

00:59:50.404 --> 00:59:53.090
can develop rather rapidly in
all kinds of animals,

00:59:53.090 --> 00:59:55.757
develop in a very short time
scale and are immediately

00:59:55.757 --> 00:59:58.838
capable of doing those things,
but if you're going to have a

00:59:58.838 --> 01:00:03.190
species with a big brain,
that's a slow process.

01:00:03.190 --> 01:00:07.280
In all the higher brain--the
bigger brain primates,

01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:10.389
the slow thing is brain
development.

01:00:10.389 --> 01:00:15.619
In order to not have to carry
this baby like for--

01:00:15.619 --> 01:00:18.980
until the brain is mature at
age 13 or something--

01:00:18.980 --> 01:00:22.130
they say we don't really
progress beyond adolescents--

01:00:22.130 --> 01:00:26.963
so in humans and great apes the
baby is born with physically

01:00:26.963 --> 01:00:31.880
somewhat mature but the brain is
still growing enormously.

01:00:31.880 --> 01:00:35.295
Really there's post-natal
development of the brain,

01:00:35.295 --> 01:00:39.394
so even at the nine months of
pregnancy, we're not at the end

01:00:39.394 --> 01:00:42.059
of the period of brain
development.

01:00:42.059 --> 01:00:46.889
The brain is nowhere near its
final size or complexity.

01:00:46.889 --> 01:00:53.833
That limits the rate at which
one can have childbirth and

01:00:53.833 --> 01:01:00.530
because the infant is born in
chimps and in humans,

01:01:00.530 --> 01:01:05.000
is born incapable of taking
care of itself,

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:10.969
the mother has to stay with the
child and take care of it.

01:01:10.969 --> 01:01:15.411
In chimps the mother stays
exclusively with her infant for

01:01:15.411 --> 01:01:16.659
several years.
 

01:01:16.659 --> 01:01:20.717
The chimps get very little,
as I mentioned,

01:01:20.717 --> 01:01:25.840
very little in the way of
resources from the males.

01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:28.500
They mostly watch and they
do--they don't come in contact

01:01:28.500 --> 01:01:31.510
with males all that much,
they and their young forage by

01:01:31.510 --> 01:01:33.065
themselves,
and etc., etc.,

01:01:33.065 --> 01:01:34.989
and the males are just
patrolling.

01:01:34.989 --> 01:01:38.297
They see them every so often
and the males protect the

01:01:38.297 --> 01:01:39.110
boundaries.
 

01:01:39.110 --> 01:01:43.065
In terms of taking care of the
young the males basically have

01:01:43.065 --> 01:01:44.449
no role whatsoever.
 

01:01:44.449 --> 01:01:49.070
As a result of this need to
have intense care of the young,

01:01:49.070 --> 01:01:51.791
and no help from anyone,
sometimes other females will

01:01:51.791 --> 01:01:54.141
help,
but basically no help at all,

01:01:54.141 --> 01:01:57.536
the period in which the mother
has to devote herself

01:01:57.536 --> 01:02:01.000
exclusively to that one young is
quite prolonged.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:04.286
Now in humans,
males do play some more

01:02:04.286 --> 01:02:07.219
intimate part in child rearing.
 

01:02:07.219 --> 01:02:09.985
Not anywhere near as much as a
female but they do bring

01:02:09.985 --> 01:02:10.599
resources.
 

01:02:10.599 --> 01:02:13.829
In general, in most human
societies over time,

01:02:13.829 --> 01:02:17.777
males are responsible for
bringing some resources to the

01:02:17.777 --> 01:02:20.650
female on a rather continuing
basis.

01:02:20.650 --> 01:02:23.608
We don't really know how this
evolved because these things you

01:02:23.608 --> 01:02:25.840
can't really tell these things
from fossils.

01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:30.432
What we know is that
Africa--the chimps started in

01:02:30.432 --> 01:02:35.681
the jungle and then Africa
started drying out and so some

01:02:35.681 --> 01:02:39.594
subset of the chimps,
maybe pushed out by stronger

01:02:39.594 --> 01:02:41.489
individuals or clever
individuals,

01:02:41.489 --> 01:02:46.635
were pushed into this drying
out grasslands where there was

01:02:46.635 --> 01:02:49.920
less cover and less fruiting
trees.

01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:54.210
Dry land doesn't produce the
big fruiting trees that chimps

01:02:54.210 --> 01:02:55.099
depend on.
 

01:02:55.099 --> 01:02:59.268
As a difference between chimps
and bonobos, when there's a

01:02:59.268 --> 01:03:03.289
lesser food density the
population has to spread out.

01:03:03.289 --> 01:03:06.032
That if an individual is going
to find any food they're not

01:03:06.032 --> 01:03:08.018
going to find enough for a large
group,

01:03:08.018 --> 01:03:12.750
so individual females would
have to go forage quite

01:03:12.750 --> 01:03:13.980
separately.
 

01:03:13.980 --> 01:03:18.250
You can speculate further that
as the females spread out,

01:03:18.250 --> 01:03:21.934
the dominant males could no
longer keep watch over and

01:03:21.934 --> 01:03:26.501
control over these females,
they were just too far spread

01:03:26.501 --> 01:03:27.869
geographically.
 

01:03:27.869 --> 01:03:33.789
While in chimps--while the male
or female may go off for a short

01:03:33.789 --> 01:03:37.539
time period,
in what's called a consortship

01:03:37.539 --> 01:03:40.659
and there may be matings at that
time,

01:03:40.659 --> 01:03:44.827
there's no lasting,
no continuing relationship

01:03:44.827 --> 01:03:48.809
between any particular male and
a female.

01:03:48.809 --> 01:03:50.418
Chimpanzees,
as I mentioned,

01:03:50.418 --> 01:03:53.753
are male bonded and they spend
more time with each other,

01:03:53.753 --> 01:03:56.076
male to male,
than the males do with the

01:03:56.076 --> 01:03:56.909
females.
 

01:03:56.909 --> 01:03:59.833
In humans of course we still
have a lot of what they call

01:03:59.833 --> 01:04:01.751
male/male bonding,
military units,

01:04:01.751 --> 01:04:03.228
sport teams,
all male clubs,

01:04:03.228 --> 01:04:06.130
football, pre-wedding parties,
watching football,

01:04:06.130 --> 01:04:10.541
watching parties,
etc., but we've evolved in the

01:04:10.541 --> 01:04:15.143
direction of much more
male/female interaction and

01:04:15.143 --> 01:04:16.269
contact.
 

01:04:16.269 --> 01:04:19.489
Female sexuality changed.
 

01:04:19.489 --> 01:04:22.289
While chimpanzees always mate
from behind,

01:04:22.289 --> 01:04:25.280
humans engage in frontal
copulation,

01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:29.155
and since the face is how
humans and also chimpanzees

01:04:29.155 --> 01:04:32.469
detect each other--
they know individuals largely

01:04:32.469 --> 01:04:35.492
by their facial structure--
and they detect emotions,

01:04:35.492 --> 01:04:38.480
it's a very important part of
communication to detect the

01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:41.360
emotions and respond to each
other by facial cues--

01:04:41.360 --> 01:04:44.614
so this face to face
interaction, especially in the

01:04:44.614 --> 01:04:48.130
intensity of the sexual
encounter is considered a large

01:04:48.130 --> 01:04:51.320
part of the evolution of
male/female bonding.

01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:55.275
I forgot to show you last time,
but it's an excuse to show you

01:04:55.275 --> 01:05:00.360
this time,
here is a bonobo engaging in

01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:04.846
front to front sex,
male and female here,

01:05:04.846 --> 01:05:06.090
and she's grinning.
 

01:05:06.090 --> 01:05:09.393
She's clearly being pretty
happy about this,

01:05:09.393 --> 01:05:13.849
and I also said I would show
you--this is two females doing

01:05:13.849 --> 01:05:15.309
the same thing.
 

01:05:15.309 --> 01:05:18.215
If you didn't--if I didn't tell
you it was--this was two females

01:05:18.215 --> 01:05:19.829
you wouldn't know the
difference.

01:05:19.829 --> 01:05:23.579
Unless you're watching you can
see that they both have their

01:05:23.579 --> 01:05:27.329
swellings, that's how you tell
that they are two females.

01:05:27.329 --> 01:05:31.713
I mean the guys who took the
picture obviously knew a lot

01:05:31.713 --> 01:05:36.411
more but you can tell that--so
this is what I described--that

01:05:36.411 --> 01:05:38.840
the locals call hoka,
hoka.

01:05:38.840 --> 01:05:44.800
This whole evolution of
sexuality in the human line,

01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:47.980
the clitoris has moved forward
for--

01:05:47.980 --> 01:05:51.570
which in face-to-face
copulation probably makes it--

01:05:51.570 --> 01:05:58.362
more female pleasure during the
act of copulation and therefore

01:05:58.362 --> 01:06:01.869
again reinforces this bonding.
 

01:06:01.869 --> 01:06:10.322
Another big difference and this
is not an extreme case of the

01:06:10.322 --> 01:06:14.409
rump--that's another topic.
 

01:06:14.409 --> 01:06:20.510
Humans do not advertise their
estrus.

01:06:20.510 --> 01:06:23.056
Not only do we not--remember
the chimps advertise their

01:06:23.056 --> 01:06:25.838
estrus in order to get the males
together and have the males

01:06:25.838 --> 01:06:26.829
compete for them.
 

01:06:26.829 --> 01:06:30.724
Humans keep it secret;
not only don't the males know

01:06:30.724 --> 01:06:35.286
when a female is in estrus,
but the female herself does not

01:06:35.286 --> 01:06:38.797
when she is estrus,
and for a very long time it was

01:06:38.797 --> 01:06:42.079
believed that females are
fertile during their periods.

01:06:42.079 --> 01:06:45.704
It was only in the 1930s that
it was found out by a Japanese

01:06:45.704 --> 01:06:49.451
group that females are fertile
in the mid-period between their

01:06:49.451 --> 01:06:51.521
periods,
and even further,

01:06:51.521 --> 01:06:55.860
it was believed in the 1930s
that females are fertile a few

01:06:55.860 --> 01:07:00.498
days before and a few days after
the middle of ovulation in the

01:07:00.498 --> 01:07:03.277
middle of the period,
and in fact,

01:07:03.277 --> 01:07:06.820
we now know just from about ten
years ago that the actual

01:07:06.820 --> 01:07:10.110
fertile period always is only
precedes ovulation.

01:07:10.110 --> 01:07:12.619
Then intercourse must take
place before ovulation.

01:07:12.619 --> 01:07:16.119
Not only do we--do human
females not advertise to the

01:07:16.119 --> 01:07:17.760
females,
they don't know,

01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:20.349
and scientists,
with all our investigations,

01:07:20.349 --> 01:07:22.309
have just now finally figured
out, we think,

01:07:22.309 --> 01:07:25.639
when a human female is fertile.
 

01:07:25.639 --> 01:07:27.253
This is a big,
big change.

01:07:27.253 --> 01:07:32.500
It's such a big part;
the advertising is such a big

01:07:32.500 --> 01:07:39.112
part of primate sexuality,
why has it disappeared in

01:07:39.112 --> 01:07:40.409
humans?
 

01:07:40.409 --> 01:07:45.596
It may be sort of the reverse,
that if females are out there

01:07:45.596 --> 01:07:49.880
alone and there's carnivores,
you read about this from the

01:07:49.880 --> 01:07:52.976
Ache, that there are lions and
tigers out there ready to eat

01:07:52.976 --> 01:07:55.106
them,
and they need protection of

01:07:55.106 --> 01:07:57.989
various sorts and maybe help in
finding food,

01:07:57.989 --> 01:08:01.130
so it's important to have a
male hanging around.

01:08:01.130 --> 01:08:05.079
A male's evolutionary purpose
is he wants to inseminate the

01:08:05.079 --> 01:08:07.813
female,
so if he knows when a female's

01:08:07.813 --> 01:08:10.668
having estrus,
he has to be there then to

01:08:10.668 --> 01:08:11.750
inseminate her.
 

01:08:11.750 --> 01:08:16.141
If he knows when she is in
estrus he also knows when she is

01:08:16.141 --> 01:08:19.762
not in estrus,
and when she's not in estrus he

01:08:19.762 --> 01:08:24.582
may have no evolutionary push to
stay there but go out and try to

01:08:24.582 --> 01:08:26.538
find some other female.
 

01:08:26.538 --> 01:08:30.375
The purpose of not showing your
estrus may be to keep the male

01:08:30.375 --> 01:08:33.896
uncertain of when you are
fertile and therefore he has to

01:08:33.896 --> 01:08:36.350
attend to the female all the
time,

01:08:36.350 --> 01:08:41.131
and once he's there he might as
well help her because that will

01:08:41.131 --> 01:08:45.760
insure that whatever infants
come along are in good shape.

01:08:45.760 --> 01:08:49.841
If that's correct,
and certainly males and females

01:08:49.841 --> 01:08:54.172
started spending more time
together, and they're more

01:08:54.172 --> 01:08:57.420
dispersed;
that reduces male/male

01:08:57.420 --> 01:08:58.649
competition.
 

01:08:58.649 --> 01:09:01.337
Remember the male/male
competition is a result of a

01:09:01.337 --> 01:09:03.810
group in which a lot of males
stay together.

01:09:03.810 --> 01:09:08.867
When you're more dispersed,
male/male competition has to be

01:09:08.867 --> 01:09:09.738
reduced.
 

01:09:09.738 --> 01:09:14.460
It looks like in the evolution
to humans that's--

01:09:14.460 --> 01:09:18.212
what's switching is from the
advertising which allows the

01:09:18.212 --> 01:09:22.569
males to compete and the female
gets the male with best genes,

01:09:22.569 --> 01:09:26.149
she's switching to wanting
resources from the male.

01:09:26.149 --> 01:09:29.606
She's no longer interested so
much in male competition but in

01:09:29.606 --> 01:09:33.064
whatever resources the male can
bring to her by having a male

01:09:33.064 --> 01:09:34.390
around continually.
 

01:09:34.390 --> 01:09:36.917
This story is rather
complicated and very

01:09:36.917 --> 01:09:40.899
controversial and there's a very
nice reading in your packet.

01:09:40.899 --> 01:09:45.530
It might be interesting to
consider that,

01:09:45.530 --> 01:09:51.899
how does the male respond to
this change in strategy?

01:09:51.899 --> 01:09:56.707
If the road to monogamy starts
going down then paternity

01:09:56.707 --> 01:09:58.720
becomes more certain.
 

01:09:58.720 --> 01:10:01.983
In the chimps,
where the female is copulating

01:10:01.983 --> 01:10:05.319
with everyone,
there's no reason to be certain

01:10:05.319 --> 01:10:07.100
of paternity at all.
 

01:10:07.100 --> 01:10:11.051
Once it becomes clear that,
yes, this child is almost

01:10:11.051 --> 01:10:14.331
certainly mine,
then it becomes evolutionary

01:10:14.331 --> 01:10:18.154
advantageous for the male to
start putting resources into

01:10:18.154 --> 01:10:22.252
this mother and child because
that insures their survival and

01:10:22.252 --> 01:10:25.939
things start developing in a
different direction.

01:10:25.939 --> 01:10:29.591
Where stable pairing becomes an
evolutionarily advantage,

01:10:29.591 --> 01:10:33.506
the male putting resources into
the pair are for evolutionary

01:10:33.506 --> 01:10:34.420
advantage.
 

01:10:34.420 --> 01:10:38.234
It seems pretty clear that an
increase in the male

01:10:38.234 --> 01:10:43.215
contribution to child rearing is
one of the major reasons for the

01:10:43.215 --> 01:10:48.327
increased fertility of humans--
why humans are able to out

01:10:48.327 --> 01:10:50.439
reproduce chimpanzees.
 

01:10:50.439 --> 01:10:55.412
Of course, as you all are
aware, monogamy has not by any

01:10:55.412 --> 01:11:00.657
means taken human societies
totally over and some societies

01:11:00.657 --> 01:11:04.846
overtly sanction polygamy,
but even in our culture which

01:11:04.846 --> 01:11:08.274
Europe and North America--
genetic testing shows that 10%

01:11:08.274 --> 01:11:12.760
to 15% of humans do not have the
father that they're supposed to

01:11:12.760 --> 01:11:13.328
have.
 

01:11:13.328 --> 01:11:15.760
'Father' is usually defined as
the resident male;

01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:19.372
he's not the father,
and that's quite a large

01:11:19.372 --> 01:11:20.439
percentage.
 

01:11:20.439 --> 01:11:25.275
American women report 6
different sexual partners

01:11:25.275 --> 01:11:29.710
lifetime and males report 16
female partners,

01:11:29.710 --> 01:11:31.020
lifetime.
 

01:11:31.020 --> 01:11:34.319
Now one thing we know if you're
at all mathematical that the--

01:11:34.319 --> 01:11:38.831
since it takes two to tango,
the average has to be the same

01:11:38.831 --> 01:11:42.945
so it can't be both 6 and 16,
and who knows possibly

01:11:42.945 --> 01:11:46.721
somewhere in between is correct,
but probably higher because

01:11:46.721 --> 01:11:48.640
these things tend to be under
reported,

01:11:48.640 --> 01:11:51.582
no one wants to really
say--well females certainly

01:11:51.582 --> 01:11:54.768
don't want to say how
promiscuous they are usually and

01:11:54.768 --> 01:11:56.270
also that's old data.
 

01:11:56.270 --> 01:12:00.899
This is from 2001 and with the
change of sexual mores in the

01:12:00.899 --> 01:12:04.194
Western countries,
I'm sure the numbers are

01:12:04.194 --> 01:12:06.470
exponentially increasing.
 

01:12:12.069 --> 01:12:16.048
What's--another thing about
this thing with respect to human

01:12:16.048 --> 01:12:19.760
evolution is that when you're a
chimpanzee the male--

01:12:19.760 --> 01:12:22.000
the main form of competition is
male/male fighting,

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.375
male/male status jockeying
which takes a certain amount of

01:12:24.375 --> 01:12:26.500
intelligence to arrange
coalitions and so forth,

01:12:26.500 --> 01:12:29.216
but basically evolution is
pushing you to be big and

01:12:29.216 --> 01:12:29.750
violent.
 

01:12:29.750 --> 01:12:33.780
Now the individuals disperse,
the male stays with the female,

01:12:33.780 --> 01:12:36.939
the males starts bringing
resources, violence is

01:12:36.939 --> 01:12:37.880
decreased.
 

01:12:37.880 --> 01:12:41.926
The importance of that in the
male evolution decreases and the

01:12:41.926 --> 01:12:45.309
importance of being able to
provide resources become

01:12:45.309 --> 01:12:48.956
evolutionarily important,
so the kind of intelligence

01:12:48.956 --> 01:12:51.899
required to find food in a
scarce environment,

01:12:51.899 --> 01:12:54.588
to find shelter,
to protect from animals and so

01:12:54.588 --> 01:12:56.109
forth becomes important.
 

01:12:56.109 --> 01:13:01.716
A fair reason for the increase
in human mental capacity might

01:13:01.716 --> 01:13:06.484
also be this shift from a
dependence on violence for

01:13:06.484 --> 01:13:11.904
competition to a dependence on
acquisition of resources for

01:13:11.904 --> 01:13:15.270
competition and for evolution.
 

01:13:15.270 --> 01:13:19.542
I've run out time and so we
will continue with humans and

01:13:19.542 --> 01:13:23.130
how they are different from
chimps next time.

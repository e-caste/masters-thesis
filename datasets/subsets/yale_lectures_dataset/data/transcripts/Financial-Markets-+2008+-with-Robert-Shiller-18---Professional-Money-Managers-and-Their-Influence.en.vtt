00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:04.809
Professor Robert
Shiller: The fundamental

00:00:04.809 --> 00:00:08.982
point that I want to make today
is that while economic theory

00:00:08.982 --> 00:00:12.878
describes people as managing
their--maximizing their--own

00:00:12.878 --> 00:00:15.730
utility and subject to
constraints,

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:18.602
most people have a lot of
trouble doing that,

00:00:18.602 --> 00:00:22.520
particularly as regards to
investing in financial markets.

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:28.471
Most people are confused and
find it just very difficult,

00:00:28.471 --> 00:00:33.997
so we have an industry of
people who help people with

00:00:33.997 --> 00:00:39.681
their investments and we,
moreover, have a whole array of

00:00:39.681 --> 00:00:44.130
regulations regulating the
industry of people who help

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:50.117
others with their investments.
The problem is that most people

00:00:50.117 --> 00:00:55.410
are not that good at dealing in
financial markets.

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.010
They're mysterious,
they're difficult,

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.471
and, moreover,
there's a tendency of

00:01:00.471 --> 00:01:04.969
psychological biases that cause
people to get into mistakes.

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:08.783
We talked about
overconfidence--that most people

00:01:08.783 --> 00:01:13.488
think they're smarter than
others--and it seems like people

00:01:13.488 --> 00:01:18.275
can easily get overconfident
about their ability to beat the

00:01:18.275 --> 00:01:21.214
market.
What naturally happens,

00:01:21.214 --> 00:01:24.900
if not regulated,
is that there will be others

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.750
who will victimize and exploit
these people.

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:35.807
The classic story is some kind
of stockbroker who promises to

00:01:35.807 --> 00:01:42.629
make great wealth for you by
trading your portfolio and,

00:01:42.629 --> 00:01:44.870
in fact, doesn't really know
anything;

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:49.610
the guy is just a showman who
is just pretending.

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:55.365
There was a 1940s book called,
Where Are The Customers

00:01:55.365 --> 00:01:59.989
Yachts?, which was a
best-selling book.

00:01:59.989 --> 00:02:03.672
The title refers to the fact
that stockbrokers give the

00:02:03.672 --> 00:02:07.833
impression that I deal with a
very wealthy successful crowd of

00:02:07.833 --> 00:02:11.584
people and you are now one of
the chosen people that I'm

00:02:11.584 --> 00:02:14.885
managing for.
Some stockbrokers will pretend

00:02:14.885 --> 00:02:19.031
to be very wealthy--create the
appearance of that--like they're

00:02:19.031 --> 00:02:22.909
associated with the rich people
and it draws people in.

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:25.902
But in fact,
the customers often don't do

00:02:25.902 --> 00:02:29.492
very well because the
stockbroker may churn their

00:02:29.492 --> 00:02:32.601
portfolio,
keep coming up with new trades,

00:02:32.601 --> 00:02:35.860
and the broker is making money
from commissions.

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.830
That's the kind of problem that
arises.

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.906
As a result,
a lot of people recognize the

00:02:43.906 --> 00:02:48.109
importance of giving help to
people, so that's what we're

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:53.839
talking about.
I want to talk mostly about

00:02:53.839 --> 00:03:00.976
portfolio managers,
but I'll first talk about

00:03:00.976 --> 00:03:10.545
financial advisors and also
financial planners and then I'll

00:03:10.545 --> 00:03:18.980
move to fiduciaries or
institutional investors.

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:33.796
We do not live in a world where
people freely do business as

00:03:33.796 --> 00:03:36.376
they would like.
The financial world is

00:03:36.376 --> 00:03:41.589
especially heavily-regulated.
The first thing is financial

00:03:41.589 --> 00:03:44.610
advisor;
again, most people don't know

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:48.338
about these markets and they
need someone to give them

00:03:48.338 --> 00:03:52.629
advice, so people set themselves
up as financial advisors.

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:57.319
In most countries,
these are heavily regulated by

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:01.328
the government.
In the United States-- Now,

00:04:01.328 --> 00:04:05.379
what is a financial advisor?
I should define that for you.

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:09.695
It's someone who gives advice
about investments for some kind

00:04:09.695 --> 00:04:14.709
of fee or commission.
It excludes lawyers,

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:23.778
bankers, insurance salesmen,
reporters from newspapers,

00:04:23.778 --> 00:04:28.214
professors.
Even though these people may

00:04:28.214 --> 00:04:32.384
all give financial advice,
it's not considered as part of

00:04:32.384 --> 00:04:35.139
law to be central to what they
do,

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:38.940
so they are excluded from the
definition of financial advisor.

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:45.066
It also excludes broker-dealers.
If someone presents himself or

00:04:45.066 --> 00:04:49.810
herself just as a broker--that's
someone you can call up and say,

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:53.742
I want to buy a hundred shares
of GM or whatever and the person

00:04:53.742 --> 00:04:56.279
does the deal--does the trade
for you.

00:04:56.279 --> 00:05:02.153
That is also not a financial
advisor, even if that person

00:05:02.153 --> 00:05:07.363
occasionally dispenses advice.
It's only incidental to the

00:05:07.363 --> 00:05:10.484
business.
Financial advisors includes

00:05:10.484 --> 00:05:16.074
people who present themselves as
offering advice to individuals

00:05:16.074 --> 00:05:21.964
and also includes analysts.
These are regulated and there's

00:05:21.964 --> 00:05:28.024
something called the National
Securities Markets Improvement

00:05:28.024 --> 00:05:33.982
Act of 1996 that says that all
financial advisors with less

00:05:33.982 --> 00:05:40.042
then twenty-five million under
management must register with

00:05:40.042 --> 00:05:45.383
their state regulator and if
it's greater than thirty

00:05:45.383 --> 00:05:49.651
million,
they must register with the SEC

00:05:49.651 --> 00:05:53.800
in Washington--Securities and
Exchange Commission.

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:57.920
If it's between,
they can choose either one.

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:04.637
They're all regulated and the
government wants to be sure that

00:06:04.637 --> 00:06:10.804
financial advisors are--know
what good practice is and so

00:06:10.804 --> 00:06:15.319
that means they have to take an
exam.

00:06:15.319 --> 00:06:22.003
The exam is administered by
what's called FINRA,

00:06:22.003 --> 00:06:30.534
that is Financial Institutions
Regulatory Authority--formerly

00:06:30.534 --> 00:06:34.349
called NASD.
See how this is getting

00:06:34.349 --> 00:06:37.639
complicated?
NASD is National Association of

00:06:37.639 --> 00:06:42.166
Securities Dealers and they
started the NASDAQ stock market

00:06:42.166 --> 00:06:45.600
index, which you hear about all
the time.

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:50.839
NASDAQ is NASD Automated
Quotation System.

00:06:50.839 --> 00:06:55.145
NASD merged with the New York
Stock Exchange Regulatory

00:06:55.145 --> 00:06:58.812
Authority last year,
so they've been renamed as

00:06:58.812 --> 00:07:00.847
FINRA.
These are all these

00:07:00.847 --> 00:07:04.233
institutional details that I
want you to know because

00:07:04.233 --> 00:07:07.228
it--it's boring,
maybe, but I think it's what's

00:07:07.228 --> 00:07:08.750
true;
it's what's happening;

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:11.370
this is what drives so much
that happens.

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:17.651
FINRA says that if you want to
become a financial advisor,

00:07:17.651 --> 00:07:24.594
you have to pass a Series--they
call it Series 65 or 66 exam and

00:07:24.594 --> 00:07:28.970
then you are eligible,
according to FINRA.

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:36.139
FINRA is an example of an SRO,
a self-regulatory organization.

00:07:36.139 --> 00:07:39.597
The government in the United
States doesn't want to be making

00:07:39.597 --> 00:07:42.454
all the rules,
so they allow industry groups

00:07:42.454 --> 00:07:45.589
to form their own self-policing
organizations.

00:07:45.589 --> 00:07:51.878
So, FINRA is the organization
for financial advisors and that

00:07:51.878 --> 00:07:56.910
is an SRO and the SEC accepts
their licensing.

00:07:56.910 --> 00:07:59.629
That's what you have to do to
become a financial advisor.

00:07:59.629 --> 00:08:03.680
You have to take these exams,
join FINRA, then you go to the

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:07.250
SEC, and then you register as a
financial advisor.

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:16.284
The exams would warn you about
all kinds of bad practices

00:08:16.284 --> 00:08:20.780
that--for example,
about churning a portfolio.

00:08:25.069 --> 00:08:26.790
I just mentioned that,
but I'll repeat it;

00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:29.437
that's when you call the guy up
everyday and you say,

00:08:29.437 --> 00:08:31.269
I just got a hot new idea for
you.

00:08:31.269 --> 00:08:36.136
Of course, yesterday you bought
Microsoft--sell that,

00:08:36.136 --> 00:08:40.062
move to this.
They just keep calling you up

00:08:40.062 --> 00:08:45.108
and that's--it's a way to get
de-licensed if you are caught

00:08:45.108 --> 00:08:48.240
doing that because it can't
work.

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:52.614
If you trade everyday there's
no--it's virtually impossible to

00:08:52.614 --> 00:08:56.629
make money because the
commissions will eat you alive.

00:08:56.629 --> 00:09:01.325
You know these guys who are
churning are fakes because they

00:09:01.325 --> 00:09:06.020
can't be getting a new idea
everyday, so that's the kind of

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:10.131
thing.
Now, financial planners are a

00:09:10.131 --> 00:09:16.399
little different.
The designation of financial

00:09:16.399 --> 00:09:23.935
planner is not regulated
directly, but we do have a

00:09:23.935 --> 00:09:31.320
self-regulatory association that
manages them.

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:38.319
We have the Financial Planning
Association--that's their

00:09:38.319 --> 00:09:45.573
website, FPA.org--and they
license--they provide their own

00:09:45.573 --> 00:09:50.005
designation.
This is how it works in the

00:09:50.005 --> 00:09:54.543
U.S., particularly;
they will certify someone as a

00:09:54.543 --> 00:09:59.885
certified financial planner and
FPA will require that every

00:09:59.885 --> 00:10:04.860
financial planner first become a
financial advisor.

00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:10.100
So, that's--this is a big
organization.

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:13.002
Incidentally,
if anyone ever asks you,

00:10:13.002 --> 00:10:16.610
I need investment advice,
where do I get it?

00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:20.204
It might be a good idea to
direct them to that website

00:10:20.204 --> 00:10:23.459
because they'll help you get a
financial planner,

00:10:23.459 --> 00:10:28.042
which is more than a broker;
they're supposed to actually be

00:10:28.042 --> 00:10:31.604
planning for your life.
That's the essential economic

00:10:31.604 --> 00:10:35.366
problem that we face.
Stockbrokers will often--this

00:10:35.366 --> 00:10:40.148
comes back to what Henry Paulson
said in his proposal for

00:10:40.148 --> 00:10:43.820
reorganization of our financial
markets.

00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:47.291
He thought--and I think this
may reflect some essential

00:10:47.291 --> 00:10:51.019
wisdom--that we should have
objectives-based regulation.

00:10:51.019 --> 00:10:54.730
Each organization should be
focused on an objective.

00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:57.166
I think the objective of the
organization affects what you

00:10:57.166 --> 00:10:59.359
do.
If you are a stockbroker and if

00:10:59.359 --> 00:11:03.382
you present yourself as someone
who will buy and sell stocks for

00:11:03.382 --> 00:11:05.338
you,
you're probably not going to

00:11:05.338 --> 00:11:07.870
get into financial planning with
your clients.

00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:12.004
If it's on your title,
if you write this after your

00:11:12.004 --> 00:11:15.559
name--John Doe,
CFP--then it says planner in

00:11:15.559 --> 00:11:18.624
your title.
I think that affects what you

00:11:18.624 --> 00:11:22.084
do and it tells--what financial
planners do is they say,

00:11:22.084 --> 00:11:25.230
let's sit down and think about
your life goals.

00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:29.190
Do you expect to have children?
Are you going to send them to

00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:31.815
college?
This kind of thought,

00:11:31.815 --> 00:11:36.701
which is very important.
There's another one

00:11:36.701 --> 00:11:42.533
called--this is for financial
advisors, NAPFA.org,

00:11:42.533 --> 00:11:49.080
National Association of
Personal Financial Advisors.

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:52.649
If someone asks you,
where should I go for advice?

00:11:52.649 --> 00:11:57.660
This is another good website to
go to because--what I like about

00:11:57.660 --> 00:12:02.034
NAPFA.org is that they have all
of their advisors sign a

00:12:02.034 --> 00:12:06.647
statement that they will be
fee-only advisors and they will

00:12:06.647 --> 00:12:11.021
never steer someone toward an
investment that provides a

00:12:11.021 --> 00:12:16.068
kickback to them.
That's a problem--that often a

00:12:16.068 --> 00:12:22.593
financial advisor will be really
trying to make money selling you

00:12:22.593 --> 00:12:27.470
things that provide money;
they're not unbiased.

00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:32.913
But NAPFA--it's part of their
code of ethics that they're

00:12:32.913 --> 00:12:37.190
completely separate from any
organization.

00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:41.126
They're pure financial advisors
and they don't make money from

00:12:41.126 --> 00:12:43.580
commissions;
it's only from the hourly fee.

00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:48.501
What else?
So, that's basically what I was

00:12:48.501 --> 00:12:50.919
going to say about financial
advisors;

00:12:50.919 --> 00:12:54.269
it's a big industry and it's
important.

00:12:54.269 --> 00:12:58.768
Actually, in my new book--I
have no--I should say,

00:12:58.768 --> 00:13:03.450
I have no connection to this
industry whatsoever,

00:13:03.450 --> 00:13:07.999
but I actually was saying that
I think as a national policy we

00:13:07.999 --> 00:13:12.494
should subsidize this industry.
I think people need more

00:13:12.494 --> 00:13:17.014
financial advice.
Most people are just not with

00:13:17.014 --> 00:13:20.355
it enough;
they're not getting the basic

00:13:20.355 --> 00:13:23.702
wisdom that--I think if we need
more of this,

00:13:23.702 --> 00:13:27.939
we should subsidize it.
I was just in Mexico over the

00:13:27.939 --> 00:13:31.367
weekend and I had the
opportunity to meet the

00:13:31.367 --> 00:13:34.923
President of Mexico,
which was exciting,

00:13:34.923 --> 00:13:40.119
and I also heard him say that
he thinks Mexico needs more

00:13:40.119 --> 00:13:43.460
development of financial
culture.

00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:47.703
This seems to be a thing that
not enough Mexicans are really

00:13:47.703 --> 00:13:50.867
used to dealing
with--sophisticated financial

00:13:50.867 --> 00:13:55.470
institutions--and so that's
where we have to go with Mexico.

00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:57.639
I was saying,
well it's just the same in

00:13:57.639 --> 00:14:01.549
every country;
I think there's a problem.

00:14:01.549 --> 00:14:09.217
The other thing--I won't say
more about financial advisors,

00:14:09.217 --> 00:14:17.413
but let's move now to the other
way that happens is that people

00:14:17.413 --> 00:14:23.884
will turn over their--actually,
I want to come back to trusts

00:14:23.884 --> 00:14:26.254
later.
Let me--the other--the really

00:14:26.254 --> 00:14:29.970
big industry that manages
peoples' financial problems for

00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:32.360
them are institutional
investors.

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:37.571
These are groups
that--organizations--that pool

00:14:37.571 --> 00:14:44.029
money from many people and
invest a portfolio for them.

00:14:44.029 --> 00:14:50.419
I want to start by emphasizing
how important they are.

00:14:50.419 --> 00:14:56.914
I want to just present you with
the balance sheet for households

00:14:56.914 --> 00:15:02.481
and non-profits and just get
some idea of how important

00:15:02.481 --> 00:15:07.261
institutional investors are.
They're more important than

00:15:07.261 --> 00:15:10.444
these financial advisors because
most of people's wealth is

00:15:10.444 --> 00:15:13.316
really managed by institutions.
You don't have to ask any

00:15:13.316 --> 00:15:15.410
questions they just--you don't
have to do anything;

00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:23.149
it's all done for you.
I wanted to show the balance

00:15:23.149 --> 00:15:35.424
sheet of households and
non-profits and that's table

00:15:35.424 --> 00:15:44.330
B100 of the Flow of Funds
Account;

00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:46.970
this is for the United States,
but I think it would be similar

00:15:46.970 --> 00:15:47.880
in other countries.

00:15:52.879 --> 00:15:56.776
We have assets on one side and
we have liabilities on the

00:15:56.776 --> 00:16:01.090
other, so we'll have assets and
then we'll have liabilities.

00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:08.903
You might wonder,
why do we put households and

00:16:08.903 --> 00:16:12.300
non-profits together?
It's really because there are

00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:15.460
three types of persons that own
things.

00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:18.580
There are individuals or
natural persons;

00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:21.243
there are non-profit
organizations,

00:16:21.243 --> 00:16:25.631
which are like individuals
because nobody owns them--they

00:16:25.631 --> 00:16:29.091
own themselves.
They're like people in contrast

00:16:29.091 --> 00:16:32.080
to corporations that are owned
by individuals.

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:35.070
Then, we also have the
government, is the third.

00:16:35.070 --> 00:16:38.592
This is the non-government
balance sheet,

00:16:38.592 --> 00:16:42.820
so it's just about everything
in this country.

00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:45.898
I just wanted to review--this
is from the Federal Reserve and

00:16:45.898 --> 00:16:48.206
these are estimates,
of course, and subject to

00:16:48.206 --> 00:16:51.272
error;
this is for 2007,

00:16:51.272 --> 00:16:57.580
fourth quarter,
which is the latest data.

00:16:57.580 --> 00:17:02.934
Assets are things that people
own and liabilities are things

00:17:02.934 --> 00:17:08.288
that people owe and your net
worth is your assets minus your

00:17:08.288 --> 00:17:13.710
liabilities.
Let's start with assets.

00:17:13.710 --> 00:17:19.385
The biggest asset that people
own in the United States--that

00:17:19.385 --> 00:17:24.098
households own is--and
non-profits--this is almost

00:17:24.098 --> 00:17:28.726
entirely households though;
non-profits are small compared

00:17:28.726 --> 00:17:33.718
to households.
Real estate is the biggest

00:17:33.718 --> 00:17:44.140
thing and that is 22,438 billion
dollars or 22 trillion dollars;

00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:48.130
people own this directly--it's
their house.

00:17:48.130 --> 00:17:57.393
The second most--the second
biggest thing is pension funds

00:17:57.393 --> 00:18:07.469
and that is 12 billion--I mean
it's 12 trillion dollars--12,779

00:18:07.469 --> 00:18:12.899
billion;
that comes right after real

00:18:12.899 --> 00:18:18.056
estate.
Then we have equity in

00:18:18.056 --> 00:18:26.870
non-corporate business and that
is 7,389--sorry,

00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:33.810
it's 7,892--it's almost 8
billion.

00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:40.292
What is non-corporate business?
It's businesses run by

00:18:40.292 --> 00:18:44.187
individuals, so it's like the
low--if a family runs a little

00:18:44.187 --> 00:18:47.368
grocery store,
then their ownership of that is

00:18:47.368 --> 00:18:50.289
represented here as
non-corporate business.

00:18:50.289 --> 00:18:53.909
Or, if you're a barber and
you've got your little

00:18:53.909 --> 00:18:56.119
barbershop.
It all adds up;

00:18:56.119 --> 00:18:59.431
they valued all of these
businesses and they valued them

00:18:59.431 --> 00:19:01.900
up totally as worth 8 trillion
dollars.

00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:12.748
Then we have corporate
equities--that's stock--and that

00:19:12.748 --> 00:19:22.190
is 5,447 billion or about 5
trillion dollars.

00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:25.310
That's stocks owned directly by
households.

00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:29.440
Then we have mutual funds.

00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:42.766
Mutual funds are institutional
investors that invest in stocks

00:19:42.766 --> 00:19:49.619
or bonds, but usually it's
mostly stocks--5.082 trillion.

00:19:49.619 --> 00:19:52.920
It's almost as big as corporate
equities held directly.

00:19:52.920 --> 00:20:01.920
Then there's consumer
durables--that means your car,

00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:15.680
your furniture;
that's 4,035 billion.

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:27.390
Bonds--2,730 billion--not so
much, not as big.

00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:31.575
Insurance--I have everything
ranked by size,

00:20:31.575 --> 00:20:37.762
so we're going down the scale.
Insurance is--this is life

00:20:37.762 --> 00:20:42.297
insurance--1,205.
Then--I'm running out of room

00:20:42.297 --> 00:20:46.779
at the bottom--there are some
other minor categories,

00:20:46.779 --> 00:20:50.487
but the total is--I would
normally put it at the bottom,

00:20:50.487 --> 00:20:53.519
but I am running out of room at
the bottom.

00:20:53.519 --> 00:21:01.811
The total assets total is
72,093 billion,

00:21:01.811 --> 00:21:13.853
so it's 72 trillion dollars.
Liabilities of households are

00:21:13.853 --> 00:21:23.089
mortgages--home mortgages--and
that's 10,509.

00:21:23.089 --> 00:21:30.850
Consumer credit--credit
cards--installment credit of

00:21:30.850 --> 00:21:46.970
various types--2,551.
Loans and other--1,315 billion.

00:21:46.970 --> 00:21:58.480
The total liabilities is 14,315
billion.

00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:03.490
So, people own 72 trillion;
they owe 14 trillion;

00:22:03.490 --> 00:22:18.880
the difference is net
worth--57,718 billion.

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:24.490
So, that's about $192,000 per
person in the United States.

00:22:24.490 --> 00:22:27.184
It's unequally held;
this is just consolidating

00:22:27.184 --> 00:22:30.713
everybody.
It's unequally held because

00:22:30.713 --> 00:22:35.890
rich people own more of this
than poor people.

00:22:35.890 --> 00:22:40.630
The average family of four has
about $800,000.

00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:44.770
I'm just multiplying $192,000
by 4.

00:22:44.770 --> 00:22:47.764
So, we have a lot of wealth.
The point here is,

00:22:47.764 --> 00:22:51.043
what form is it in?
Well, real estate is very

00:22:51.043 --> 00:22:53.527
unmanaged;
people own their own homes and

00:22:53.527 --> 00:22:57.021
there's not much institutional
involvement except through the

00:22:57.021 --> 00:22:59.132
mortgage.
Note that they owe about

00:22:59.132 --> 00:23:01.839
half--they only own about half
of their home.

00:23:01.839 --> 00:23:06.190
The average person owes on the
mortgage almost half the value

00:23:06.190 --> 00:23:10.674
of their home.
If you took net worth in real

00:23:10.674 --> 00:23:16.519
estate, it would be only like 12
trillion dollars;

00:23:16.519 --> 00:23:19.119
assets minus real estate
liability.

00:23:19.119 --> 00:23:22.518
By that account,
the biggest asset that people

00:23:22.518 --> 00:23:25.539
have is apparently their pension
fund;

00:23:25.539 --> 00:23:30.470
that's huge and that is
institutional investors.

00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:33.538
The thing I wanted to make--the
point I wanted to make about

00:23:33.538 --> 00:23:36.399
this is that institutional
investors dominate just about

00:23:36.399 --> 00:23:38.591
everything.
I mean, you've got real estate

00:23:38.591 --> 00:23:41.319
and non-corporate business,
which are not easily managed by

00:23:41.319 --> 00:23:44.357
institutional investors.
Beyond that,

00:23:44.357 --> 00:23:52.309
it's mostly institutional
mutual funds and insurance.

00:23:52.309 --> 00:23:57.114
We live in a country where
things are managed by

00:23:57.114 --> 00:23:59.670
professional investors.

00:24:10.579 --> 00:24:13.210
Let's talk about--what is a
mutual fund?

00:24:13.210 --> 00:24:18.552
A mutual fund refers to a
structure of an investment

00:24:18.552 --> 00:24:23.223
company.
They're much more important

00:24:23.223 --> 00:24:26.908
than hedge funds.
Hedge funds are--we talked

00:24:26.908 --> 00:24:29.835
about those before--are designed
for a small group of wealthy

00:24:29.835 --> 00:24:32.426
investors.
Mutual funds are for the

00:24:32.426 --> 00:24:37.153
general public and the reason
they're called mutual is that

00:24:37.153 --> 00:24:40.740
the fund is owned by the
investors in it.

00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:48.561
The first mutual fund was
called MIT--no connection with

00:24:48.561 --> 00:24:54.250
Massachusetts Institute of
Technology.

00:24:54.250 --> 00:24:59.920
This was the Massachusetts
Investors Trust in the 1920s.

00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:03.779
At that time,
there were a lot of investor

00:25:03.779 --> 00:25:08.204
funds that were
not--relatively--unregulated and

00:25:08.204 --> 00:25:14.230
they were offering investments
to people that were oversold,

00:25:14.230 --> 00:25:18.020
often.
Often there were classes of

00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:21.335
shareholders.
There was a class of prime

00:25:21.335 --> 00:25:25.800
shareholders who got the profits
from the enterprise and then

00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:30.116
there was a class of other
shareholders who were the hoi

00:25:30.116 --> 00:25:32.470
polloi.
After 1929,

00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:38.018
many of the investment funds
crashed and burned and people

00:25:38.018 --> 00:25:40.966
got very upset.
They were very upset,

00:25:40.966 --> 00:25:43.302
particularly,
that the investment fund was

00:25:43.302 --> 00:25:46.606
really being run for the profit
and benefit of the guys who

00:25:46.606 --> 00:25:49.570
started the fund,
not all the people who were in

00:25:49.570 --> 00:25:51.689
there.
After 1929, there was some

00:25:51.689 --> 00:25:55.260
looking around as how should
investment funds really be

00:25:55.260 --> 00:25:58.564
organized.
Then attention became focused

00:25:58.564 --> 00:26:03.369
on MIT because it was an honest
fund and they thought this

00:26:03.369 --> 00:26:08.089
should be the model for our
investment fund industry.

00:26:08.089 --> 00:26:11.591
What Massachusetts Investment
Trust did is they said,

00:26:11.591 --> 00:26:15.428
everybody is equal and we're
completely open about what we

00:26:15.428 --> 00:26:18.491
do.
We publish our portfolio and

00:26:18.491 --> 00:26:21.730
most investment funds were
secret.

00:26:21.730 --> 00:26:23.513
They were saying,
well we're going to beat the

00:26:23.513 --> 00:26:24.912
market;
we're not going to publish what

00:26:24.912 --> 00:26:27.471
we're doing.
The MIT published its portfolio

00:26:27.471 --> 00:26:30.210
and it had only one class of
investors.

00:26:30.210 --> 00:26:33.230
In fact, the fund was owned by
the investors;

00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:36.483
it's a mutual fund,
so if you put money in,

00:26:36.483 --> 00:26:39.867
you join the crowd.
We invest for you and if you

00:26:39.867 --> 00:26:43.506
want to take your money out,
we'll share your proportion of

00:26:43.506 --> 00:26:47.499
the whole portfolio.
That was the concept,

00:26:47.499 --> 00:26:54.296
so the concept became very
widely respected and the whole

00:26:54.296 --> 00:27:00.102
industry grew.
The Investment Act of

00:27:00.102 --> 00:27:11.328
1940--Investment Company Act of
1940--it doesn't actually define

00:27:11.328 --> 00:27:15.578
mutual funds,
but it defines structures that

00:27:15.578 --> 00:27:19.469
are used by mutual funds.
After the Investment Company

00:27:19.469 --> 00:27:24.924
Act, starting in the 1950s,
mutual funds began to grow and

00:27:24.924 --> 00:27:25.690
grow.

00:27:31.180 --> 00:27:35.971
They are regulated in such a
way that the--as I said,

00:27:35.971 --> 00:27:40.882
everyone is equal in the fund;
everyone benefits from the

00:27:40.882 --> 00:27:45.920
portfolio in an equal way.
The rule is that if--you don't

00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:49.920
buy and sell shares in the
mutual fund.

00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:53.295
The fund owns shares;
you're putting money into the

00:27:53.295 --> 00:27:56.042
fund and if you want to get
money out of the fund,

00:27:56.042 --> 00:27:59.069
you call them up or maybe you
can do it on the web.

00:27:59.069 --> 00:28:03.059
You say--you place an order to
withdraw money from the fund.

00:28:03.059 --> 00:28:07.519
What they will do when you
withdraw money is they wait

00:28:07.519 --> 00:28:12.165
until four p.m.
on the day of your order and

00:28:12.165 --> 00:28:19.172
then they calculate what your
share of the fund would be based

00:28:19.172 --> 00:28:22.750
on--four p.m.
is when the stock markets close.

00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:28.136
So, at four p.m.
you would get out at those

00:28:28.136 --> 00:28:33.970
prices and that was considered a
fair and honest thing to do.

00:28:33.970 --> 00:28:36.780
They don't charge high
management fees;

00:28:36.780 --> 00:28:44.317
there are rules about that.
So, they have their own SRO

00:28:44.317 --> 00:28:51.329
called ICI, Investment Company
Institute.

00:28:51.329 --> 00:28:53.529
That was created,
I believe, in the 1940s.

00:28:53.529 --> 00:28:57.304
This has become the structure
for the way most people--well,

00:28:57.304 --> 00:29:00.950
half the people--most small
investors do not own corporate

00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:03.819
equity directly;
they own mutual funds.

00:29:03.819 --> 00:29:10.757
There have been some scandals
about mutual funds that emerged

00:29:10.757 --> 00:29:13.880
in the last decade or so.

00:29:17.970 --> 00:29:19.110
There's something called late
trading.

00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:29.056
What was happening was,
sometimes these mutual funds

00:29:29.056 --> 00:29:31.440
didn't enforce the rules well
enough.

00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:35.599
You would tell your broker,
I'd like to withdraw money from

00:29:35.599 --> 00:29:40.466
the mutual fund.
The broker would then sometimes

00:29:40.466 --> 00:29:46.185
call after four p.m.
and say, my client really asked

00:29:46.185 --> 00:29:50.650
me to sell this at ten a.m.
this morning.

00:29:50.650 --> 00:29:53.419
I know it's five p.m.,
but trust me,

00:29:53.419 --> 00:29:57.435
I'd like to get out.
Mutual funds would let this

00:29:57.435 --> 00:29:59.433
happen.
Then it turned out to be

00:29:59.433 --> 00:30:00.900
abusive.
Why is that abusive?

00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:04.726
If you're a mutual fund and you
get this call from a broker

00:30:04.726 --> 00:30:08.750
saying, trust me my client asked
me to get out at ten a.m.;

00:30:08.750 --> 00:30:11.009
I know it's five.
Can we get out?

00:30:11.009 --> 00:30:15.407
Well, that turns out to be a
bad practice because what ended

00:30:15.407 --> 00:30:18.240
up happening was people abused
that.

00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:22.529
They would wait until five or
six p.m.

00:30:22.529 --> 00:30:25.500
and they would observe what
seems to be happening in the

00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:27.087
markets.
If it's going up,

00:30:27.087 --> 00:30:30.105
then they would say,
we want to put money into the

00:30:30.105 --> 00:30:31.938
mutual fund.
If it's going down,

00:30:31.938 --> 00:30:34.088
they would say,
we're trying to take money out

00:30:34.088 --> 00:30:36.864
of the mutual fund.
You see how that hurts the

00:30:36.864 --> 00:30:40.910
other mutual fund investors
because you do it strategically.

00:30:40.910 --> 00:30:45.138
You do--if you know the market
is up, you're trading on stale

00:30:45.138 --> 00:30:48.326
prices--on old prices.
So, obviously you could make

00:30:48.326 --> 00:30:51.213
money doing that and this got a
lot of attention in the

00:30:51.213 --> 00:30:52.870
newspaper--the late trading.

00:31:00.279 --> 00:31:04.286
There was another variation on
that called market timing,

00:31:04.286 --> 00:31:08.364
but it's basically the same
thing--where mutual funds were

00:31:08.364 --> 00:31:12.872
not enforcing the rules properly
and so some people were trading

00:31:12.872 --> 00:31:15.990
at four p.m.
prices, effectively after it.

00:31:25.650 --> 00:31:28.781
They've cleaned up this act,
so I think that mutual funds

00:31:28.781 --> 00:31:31.912
are our most trusted way of
investing in the stock market

00:31:31.912 --> 00:31:35.380
and most people won't invest in
individual stocks anymore;

00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:38.190
they just go through mutual
funds.

00:31:38.190 --> 00:31:50.334
There is another kind of thing
that has developed more recently

00:31:50.334 --> 00:32:00.519
and it's called an Exchange
Traded Fund or an ETF.

00:32:00.519 --> 00:32:05.039
These were created first--these
are relatively new.

00:32:05.039 --> 00:32:12.598
These were created first at the
American Stock Exchange in 1993

00:32:12.598 --> 00:32:17.839
and they're different from a
mutual fund.

00:32:17.839 --> 00:32:20.380
I didn't show them separately
on this;

00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:22.501
they're much smaller than
mutual funds,

00:32:22.501 --> 00:32:25.460
but I believe they're less than
a trillion dollars.

00:32:25.460 --> 00:32:28.009
They must be in one of these
other categories up there.

00:32:28.009 --> 00:32:32.868
Exchange Traded Funds are
different than a mutual fund in

00:32:32.868 --> 00:32:36.599
that they are traded on a stock
exchange.

00:32:36.599 --> 00:32:42.474
The first Exchange Traded Fund
was a company called the

00:32:42.474 --> 00:32:48.349
SPDR--that's Standard and Poor's
Depository Receipt.

00:32:48.349 --> 00:32:53.112
But now, there is a
proliferation of Exchange Traded

00:32:53.112 --> 00:32:56.040
Funds.
What is an Exchange Traded Fund?

00:33:00.839 --> 00:33:08.645
Exchanged Traded Fund is
epitomized by the--this is the

00:33:08.645 --> 00:33:16.884
S&amp;P 500--it's a portfolio
that is managed according to

00:33:16.884 --> 00:33:19.609
rules;
it's not judgmental.

00:33:19.609 --> 00:33:25.798
You cannot call up the Exchange
Traded Fund and say,

00:33:25.798 --> 00:33:30.311
I want my money back.
It's different from a mutual

00:33:30.311 --> 00:33:32.717
fund.
If you get--you would buy or

00:33:32.717 --> 00:33:36.500
sell an Exchange Traded Fund on
the stock exchange.

00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:42.049
The fund is traded--the
Exchange Traded Fund holds a

00:33:42.049 --> 00:33:48.470
portfolio, like the SPDR holds a
portfolio equivalent to the

00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:54.019
S&amp;P 500 and they pay out
dividends on that.

00:33:54.019 --> 00:33:57.910
But in the meantime,
you can buy or sell shares in

00:33:57.910 --> 00:34:04.345
the fund on the stock exchange.
They also have what are called

00:34:04.345 --> 00:34:08.541
creation units,
which are in large

00:34:08.541 --> 00:34:14.010
denominations,
like millions of dollars.

00:34:14.010 --> 00:34:20.049
Institutional investors can
either create or redeem shares

00:34:20.049 --> 00:34:25.030
in the ETFs, but you as an
individual cannot.

00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:28.626
If the creation unit is one
million dollars,

00:34:28.626 --> 00:34:33.811
then an institutional investor
who is an authorized participant

00:34:33.811 --> 00:34:39.079
and has signed the right papers
can go to the AMEX and say,

00:34:39.079 --> 00:34:43.420
I want to create ten million
dollars of new SPDRs.

00:34:43.420 --> 00:34:47.429
Then, the AMEX will--that's ten
creation units.

00:34:47.429 --> 00:34:50.556
I forget what a SPDRs creation
unit is, but let's say it's a

00:34:50.556 --> 00:34:53.216
million dollars.
Then the AMEX would say,

00:34:53.216 --> 00:34:57.483
alright, you have to give us
the stocks in the S&amp;P 500 in

00:34:57.483 --> 00:35:01.110
the proportion that they are in
the S&amp;P 500,

00:35:01.110 --> 00:35:04.409
equal in value to ten million
dollars.

00:35:04.409 --> 00:35:09.585
That becomes one creation unit
and then they'll give the

00:35:09.585 --> 00:35:13.820
institutional investors the
shares to sell.

00:35:13.820 --> 00:35:17.675
Conversely, the institutional
investor can go to the AMEX and

00:35:17.675 --> 00:35:22.792
say, I want to go the other way.
I've got 10,000 shares of these

00:35:22.792 --> 00:35:26.239
ETFs;
I want the stocks back.

00:35:26.239 --> 00:35:29.917
So, the institutional investor
can present the shares to the

00:35:29.917 --> 00:35:33.781
AMEX and the AMEX will then give
them the shares in the S&amp;P

00:35:33.781 --> 00:35:36.793
500.
That enforces the price of the

00:35:36.793 --> 00:35:40.900
ETF equal to the price of the
underlying stocks.

00:35:40.900 --> 00:35:46.935
ETFs were designed so that the
price of the ETF tracks the

00:35:46.935 --> 00:35:51.378
price of the underlying stocks.
In contrast,

00:35:51.378 --> 00:35:55.728
those things called Closed End
Funds, which are similar,

00:35:55.728 --> 00:35:59.050
but they don't have the
creation units.

00:35:59.050 --> 00:36:02.585
Closed End Funds--the price of
the fund on the stock market

00:36:02.585 --> 00:36:06.182
tends to go through either a
premium or a discount depending

00:36:06.182 --> 00:36:10.429
on the market,
but ETFs tend to track well.

00:36:10.429 --> 00:36:17.063
That is, the price of the ETF
tends to correspond to the price

00:36:17.063 --> 00:36:23.465
of the underlying stocks;
whereas, closed end mutual

00:36:23.465 --> 00:36:28.530
funds--closed end funds track
poorly.

00:36:28.530 --> 00:36:39.099
So, ETFs are the new things
that have developed.

00:36:39.099 --> 00:36:42.260
I said I would talk about
personal trusts.

00:36:42.260 --> 00:36:49.358
This is something that is of
less--somewhat less--importance,

00:36:49.358 --> 00:36:56.220
but it's about a trillion
dollars in our modern economy.

00:36:56.220 --> 00:37:00.725
What is a trust?
It's another form of

00:37:00.725 --> 00:37:02.070
institutional investing.

00:37:14.469 --> 00:37:23.287
A trust is a--it's often a
department of a bank that

00:37:23.287 --> 00:37:32.449
manages money on behalf of an
individual or family.

00:37:32.449 --> 00:37:36.519
For example,
suppose your parents are

00:37:36.519 --> 00:37:43.188
concerned about you and they
don't trust you--they trust the

00:37:43.188 --> 00:37:48.840
banker, not you--and there's a
family fortune.

00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:52.168
Maybe it doesn't have to be
that big, but let's say it's a

00:37:52.168 --> 00:37:55.972
million dollars.
They could give it to you,

00:37:55.972 --> 00:37:59.341
but they might not.
I don't know what your parents

00:37:59.341 --> 00:38:00.953
are doing;
they're doing this behind your

00:38:00.953 --> 00:38:02.800
back and maybe not telling you
in great detail.

00:38:06.340 --> 00:38:08.896
Of particular importance,
as an example,

00:38:08.896 --> 00:38:11.650
is something called a
spendthrift trust.

00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:25.114
What is a spendthrift?
It's someone who can't save

00:38:25.114 --> 00:38:29.640
money and squanders it.
Your parents can go to a bank

00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:34.769
and set up a spendthrift trust
on your behalf and the

00:38:34.769 --> 00:38:40.489
spendthrift trust will then pay
you an income for life.

00:38:40.489 --> 00:38:42.039
Or, they could even go beyond
your life;

00:38:42.039 --> 00:38:45.460
they could go to your children
or whatever.

00:38:45.460 --> 00:38:48.783
That prevents you from
squandering the money--from

00:38:48.783 --> 00:38:52.920
going to the casino and gambling
it away if your parents don't

00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:57.159
trust you.
You see the idea?

00:38:57.159 --> 00:39:00.915
The bank then will manage it
for the rest of your life and

00:39:00.915 --> 00:39:04.210
your parents will die and you
will outlive them,

00:39:04.210 --> 00:39:07.795
but that money will be stuck in
that trust and you can't get it

00:39:07.795 --> 00:39:10.340
out because they set it up and
it's there.

00:39:10.340 --> 00:39:15.025
The manager of the trust is a
fiduciary who is,

00:39:15.025 --> 00:39:19.201
by contract,
is supposed to be managing in

00:39:19.201 --> 00:39:24.599
the interest of the child--the
spendthrift child.

00:39:24.599 --> 00:39:28.954
Of course, everyone--all these
people will be dead before you

00:39:28.954 --> 00:39:30.750
are.
Your parents will die;

00:39:30.750 --> 00:39:34.070
the person they talked to at
the bank setting up the trust

00:39:34.070 --> 00:39:37.739
will die, but when you're ninety
years old there will be someone

00:39:37.739 --> 00:39:40.942
at that bank--some person much
younger than you--who was

00:39:40.942 --> 00:39:43.971
appointed in succession to
manage your trust and will

00:39:43.971 --> 00:39:47.349
continue to pay you that income
out of your trust.

00:39:47.349 --> 00:39:50.629
Now, if there's another reason
why your parents might be doing

00:39:50.629 --> 00:39:53.856
this, which--you might be angry
with your parents if they did

00:39:53.856 --> 00:39:56.079
this,
but they might do it for

00:39:56.079 --> 00:39:59.513
another reason.
That is, you could get married

00:39:59.513 --> 00:40:04.060
and get a divorce and they're
worried about this really awful

00:40:04.060 --> 00:40:08.759
person you married taking half
of the family money when you get

00:40:08.759 --> 00:40:11.167
divorced.
They lock it up in a

00:40:11.167 --> 00:40:15.208
spendthrift trust and then after
the divorce the trustee will

00:40:15.208 --> 00:40:17.902
say,
no way, I'm bound to pay this

00:40:17.902 --> 00:40:22.116
person--not the wife or
husband--the amount of money for

00:40:22.116 --> 00:40:24.610
life.
It apparently works.

00:40:24.610 --> 00:40:27.786
So, that's another reason why
families will do this because

00:40:27.786 --> 00:40:30.852
they don't want to give the
money to the awful person you

00:40:30.852 --> 00:40:31.510
married.

00:40:35.989 --> 00:40:41.780
In Common Law countries,
trusts are--that's the U.S.

00:40:41.780 --> 00:40:46.207
and the UK--trusts are
well-defined in law and a

00:40:46.207 --> 00:40:51.352
trustee has well-defined rights.
If you are--and it doesn't have

00:40:51.352 --> 00:40:54.580
to be a bank;
you could have a friend of

00:40:54.580 --> 00:40:58.449
yours become a trustee.
In Common Law countries,

00:40:58.449 --> 00:41:02.699
there's a nice segregation of
the assets in the trust and the

00:41:02.699 --> 00:41:05.786
assets of the trustee.
Suppose you ask your

00:41:05.786 --> 00:41:09.536
brother-in-law to serve as a
trustee for your children and

00:41:09.536 --> 00:41:12.958
then your brother-in-law gets
into some bad financial

00:41:12.958 --> 00:41:17.321
situation and goes bankrupt;
courts will not be allowed to

00:41:17.321 --> 00:41:21.325
take the Trust that the
brother-in-law is managing for

00:41:21.325 --> 00:41:25.712
your children.
This wasn't so clear in Civil

00:41:25.712 --> 00:41:29.349
Law countries,
such as in Europe.

00:41:29.349 --> 00:41:33.806
The typical trust in Europe has
been that you would go to a bank

00:41:33.806 --> 00:41:37.059
and the bank would manage the
trust for you.

00:41:37.059 --> 00:41:40.420
If the bank went under,
you might lose the money.

00:41:40.420 --> 00:41:44.668
Maybe they're more trusting of
their banks in Europe,

00:41:44.668 --> 00:41:47.610
but I think this is also
changing.

00:41:47.610 --> 00:41:49.940
The law is always changing.

00:41:54.269 --> 00:42:01.615
Now, I want to come to pension
funds, which are the most

00:42:01.615 --> 00:42:06.921
important kind of institution.
You can see up there,

00:42:06.921 --> 00:42:08.690
that's the twelve trillion
dollars.

00:42:08.690 --> 00:42:11.899
It doesn't include--this
pension fund here does not

00:42:11.899 --> 00:42:14.851
include Social Security,
which is of comparable

00:42:14.851 --> 00:42:17.795
magnitude.
The government runs its own

00:42:17.795 --> 00:42:20.901
pension fund,
in effect, called the Social

00:42:20.901 --> 00:42:24.309
Security System and that's not
shown here.

00:42:24.309 --> 00:42:30.880
Pension funds are private funds
managing a portfolio of assets.

00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:35.308
The Social Security System does
not manage a substantial

00:42:35.308 --> 00:42:38.731
portfolio of assets.
The Social Security System,

00:42:38.731 --> 00:42:42.217
which is a--it's not on here,
I'm just mentioning it as an

00:42:42.217 --> 00:42:47.657
aside--was set up by U.S.
Congress in 1935 to provide for

00:42:47.657 --> 00:42:54.510
the elderly and also for
disabled and orphaned children.

00:42:54.510 --> 00:42:58.460
But, the main Social Security
provides for the elderly.

00:42:58.460 --> 00:43:01.579
It does so without
investing--there is something

00:43:01.579 --> 00:43:05.960
called the Social Security Trust
Fund managed by the government,

00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:11.000
which invests in assets to help
the government pay out on social

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:13.217
security.
However, the Social Security

00:43:13.217 --> 00:43:15.510
Trust Fund is only,
last time I heard about it,

00:43:15.510 --> 00:43:16.018
one trillion dollars
[Correction: the Social Security

00:43:16.018 --> 00:43:16.634
Old Age and Survivors Insurance
Trust Fund assets rose from 1.07

00:43:16.634 --> 00:43:17.260
trillion dollars in 2001 to 2.02
trillion dollars in 2007.].

00:43:17.260 --> 00:43:22.218
So, the government is not
investing much compared to these

00:43:22.218 --> 00:43:26.420
pension funds;
pension funds are much bigger.

00:43:26.420 --> 00:43:32.095
These are agencies--private
agencies--that invest on behalf

00:43:32.095 --> 00:43:37.868
of people for their retirement
and they are a very important

00:43:37.868 --> 00:43:41.843
element of our economy.
They help us solve the

00:43:41.843 --> 00:43:45.116
essential problem that everyone
goes through their life

00:43:45.116 --> 00:43:47.870
cycle--you're young;
you're healthy for a while;

00:43:47.870 --> 00:43:51.041
you're working.
Then, your health starts to

00:43:51.041 --> 00:43:56.006
deteriorate and then you have
years or decades when you are

00:43:56.006 --> 00:44:00.971
either not inclined to work or
cannot work and this happens

00:44:00.971 --> 00:44:05.166
with such regularity that it
requires some kind of

00:44:05.166 --> 00:44:09.420
professional management;
that's what pension funds do.

00:44:09.420 --> 00:44:14.050
I want to talk about these in
some more detail.

00:44:14.050 --> 00:44:17.625
It wasn't until the nineteenth
century that we had them,

00:44:17.625 --> 00:44:21.329
which is kind of surprising
because it's such an important

00:44:21.329 --> 00:44:23.832
problem.
Even in the nineteenth century

00:44:23.832 --> 00:44:29.898
they were few and rare.
The first U.S.--I think they go

00:44:29.898 --> 00:44:36.116
back earlier in the U.K.
and in places in Europe,

00:44:36.116 --> 00:44:42.207
but in the United States the
first corporate pension fund was

00:44:42.207 --> 00:44:46.759
American Express in 1875.
American Express,

00:44:46.759 --> 00:44:50.480
then, was not a credit card
company;

00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:57.320
it was a shipping company or
transportation company.

00:45:01.869 --> 00:45:06.546
This first pension fund was for
the employees of American

00:45:06.546 --> 00:45:09.719
Express and the original terms
were,

00:45:09.719 --> 00:45:13.704
you had to work there for
twenty years and past the age of

00:45:13.704 --> 00:45:16.500
sixty and you had also to be
disabled.

00:45:16.500 --> 00:45:20.074
If you satisfied those--if you
were over sixty,

00:45:20.074 --> 00:45:24.269
you had worked at American
Express for twenty years,

00:45:24.269 --> 00:45:30.105
and also were disabled--you
would get 50% of the average pay

00:45:30.105 --> 00:45:34.260
for the last ten years you
worked there.

00:45:34.260 --> 00:45:36.430
This is the earliest model in
the U.S.

00:45:42.750 --> 00:45:46.659
and that gradually became
copied by more companies.

00:45:46.659 --> 00:45:50.317
It became more and more
important as we moved into the

00:45:50.317 --> 00:45:54.250
twentieth century because life
expectancy was going up.

00:45:54.250 --> 00:45:57.725
There were relatively few
people with--the life expectancy

00:45:57.725 --> 00:46:00.530
at 1900 was something like
forty-five years;

00:46:00.530 --> 00:46:03.655
I don't have the exact number.
So, sixty was a milestone that

00:46:03.655 --> 00:46:08.225
a lot of people didn't reach.
Of course, many did as well,

00:46:08.225 --> 00:46:12.579
so it's not--this was important
even then.

00:46:12.579 --> 00:46:16.633
The original pension funds
tended to be done for the

00:46:16.633 --> 00:46:20.130
benefit of the employer in the
sense that,

00:46:20.130 --> 00:46:23.581
like the American Express,
you had to work there for all

00:46:23.581 --> 00:46:26.280
of twenty years in order to get
anything;

00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:28.710
it was all or nothing.
If you worked there for

00:46:28.710 --> 00:46:30.590
nineteen years,
then too bad;

00:46:30.590 --> 00:46:33.409
you got nothing.
It didn't seem well-designed,

00:46:33.409 --> 00:46:35.640
but it was designed to keep
people there;

00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:38.221
they didn't want people leaving.
So, once you signed on to

00:46:38.221 --> 00:46:40.546
American Express,
you were kind of stuck there

00:46:40.546 --> 00:46:42.510
because you didn't want to get
out;

00:46:42.510 --> 00:46:44.480
you'd lose your pension.

00:46:50.969 --> 00:46:55.360
It wasn't very big--or big
institution.

00:46:55.360 --> 00:47:02.693
In Carnegie Steel--pension plan
was 1901--Andrew Carnegie--which

00:47:02.693 --> 00:47:08.513
was a milestone because it
started to establish the

00:47:08.513 --> 00:47:15.498
principle on a--this was the
first big company to establish a

00:47:15.498 --> 00:47:20.845
pension fund.
It grew through the first few

00:47:20.845 --> 00:47:26.791
decades of the nineteenth
century and by 1929 there were

00:47:26.791 --> 00:47:31.225
many pension funds.
They started doing union

00:47:31.225 --> 00:47:35.363
pension funds.
There were the cigar

00:47:35.363 --> 00:47:42.497
makers--that was a
union--granite cutters and cigar

00:47:42.497 --> 00:47:48.855
makers--1905.
Locomotive engineers--that was

00:47:48.855 --> 00:47:56.598
1912--but many of these funds
failed in 1929 and they were

00:47:56.598 --> 00:48:04.613
offered by companies for their
employees or unions for their

00:48:04.613 --> 00:48:08.576
members.
When companies offered pensions

00:48:08.576 --> 00:48:12.118
for their employees,
that was a risky thing because

00:48:12.118 --> 00:48:14.750
companies go bankrupt;
it happens all the time.

00:48:14.750 --> 00:48:18.011
If they go bankrupt,
how are they going to pay the

00:48:18.011 --> 00:48:21.020
pension plan?
Well, that was tough luck for

00:48:21.020 --> 00:48:23.385
the employees.
That was a less enlightened

00:48:23.385 --> 00:48:25.531
time.
They didn't--the point was that

00:48:25.531 --> 00:48:27.800
they rarely funded the pension
funds.

00:48:27.800 --> 00:48:30.695
In the early decades of the
twentieth century,

00:48:30.695 --> 00:48:33.784
Carnegie Steel just--I don't
know about Carnegie,

00:48:33.784 --> 00:48:36.679
but generally,
they just promised to pay.

00:48:36.679 --> 00:48:39.369
They just said,
we will pay you when you

00:48:39.369 --> 00:48:42.110
retire;
out of what, you might ask.

00:48:42.110 --> 00:48:44.659
Well, that wasn't explained,
but it had to be out of

00:48:44.659 --> 00:48:46.981
profits.
What if they weren't making any

00:48:46.981 --> 00:48:50.430
profits?
Well, people didn't seem to

00:48:50.430 --> 00:48:55.838
anticipate this.
After 1929, these pension funds

00:48:55.838 --> 00:49:01.710
became discredited because so
many of them failed.

00:49:01.710 --> 00:49:10.119
That led to an idea that we had
to do something different.

00:49:10.119 --> 00:49:20.508
The big milestone in pension
history is the General Motors

00:49:20.508 --> 00:49:25.429
Pension Fund,
GM Pension,

00:49:25.429 --> 00:49:33.541
which was created in 1950 and
it was promoted by GM Chairman,

00:49:33.541 --> 00:49:35.840
Charles Wilson.

00:49:41.030 --> 00:49:44.900
I visited them recently;
they're in that building right

00:49:44.900 --> 00:49:50.356
across the street from the Plaza
Hotel at the corner of Central

00:49:50.356 --> 00:49:54.771
Park;
they're a very big organization

00:49:54.771 --> 00:49:58.240
now.
The thing that GM Pension Fund

00:49:58.240 --> 00:50:04.268
did, it invested--it funded--so,
they started investing money on

00:50:04.268 --> 00:50:10.679
behalf of the pensioners so that
if GM were ever to go bankrupt,

00:50:10.679 --> 00:50:13.389
there would still be money in
the fund.

00:50:13.389 --> 00:50:19.524
Not GM Stock--this was the most
amazing thing--General Motors

00:50:19.524 --> 00:50:25.352
was investing money for its
pension fund and of all things

00:50:25.352 --> 00:50:29.314
it wasn't buying GM stock.
Some people thought,

00:50:29.314 --> 00:50:31.060
why wouldn't they buy their own
stock?

00:50:31.060 --> 00:50:33.938
That would push the price up.
Of course, it's not enlightened

00:50:33.938 --> 00:50:36.636
to buy their own stock
because--that would be stupid to

00:50:36.636 --> 00:50:39.534
invest the pension fund in your
own stock because the stock

00:50:39.534 --> 00:50:42.581
would become worthless in the
same circumstance that you would

00:50:42.581 --> 00:50:44.830
be unable to make good on the
pension,

00:50:44.830 --> 00:50:48.021
so it wouldn't do any good.
It just seems obvious that

00:50:48.021 --> 00:50:52.620
companies should fund their
pension funds and should invest

00:50:52.620 --> 00:50:56.030
in something other than their
own stock.

00:51:01.250 --> 00:51:04.139
That may seem obvious,
but it took until 1950.

00:51:04.139 --> 00:51:08.648
One thing that strikes me about
financial history is that it

00:51:08.648 --> 00:51:13.080
seems like we go for such a long
time doing things that are

00:51:13.080 --> 00:51:16.784
obviously not right and,
as long as there's no crisis,

00:51:16.784 --> 00:51:20.398
nobody pays attention to it.
Then, we have this huge crisis,

00:51:20.398 --> 00:51:24.164
like the 1929 stock market
crash, and then it's only after

00:51:24.164 --> 00:51:26.940
the crisis that anyone thinks
about it.

00:51:26.940 --> 00:51:30.275
I don't know what was happening
for the first thirty years of

00:51:30.275 --> 00:51:33.237
the twentieth century;
they had all these pension

00:51:33.237 --> 00:51:36.179
funds, but the whole idea seemed
to be faulty.

00:51:36.179 --> 00:51:39.317
Why would you think that your
company can support you in your

00:51:39.317 --> 00:51:41.460
old age?
That's decades in the future.

00:51:41.460 --> 00:51:44.620
The chance that your company
would go under has to be

00:51:44.620 --> 00:51:48.327
substantial, but people don't
seem to see these risks and they

00:51:48.327 --> 00:51:51.610
don't think about them until
there's a big crisis.

00:51:51.610 --> 00:51:54.766
That's why I think that we are
at an opportune time right now

00:51:54.766 --> 00:51:58.067
with another financial crisis;
it's a time when people might

00:51:58.067 --> 00:52:01.190
be willing to think about how to
do things differently.

00:52:01.190 --> 00:52:12.216
The next big crisis in pension
fund history was the Studebaker

00:52:12.216 --> 00:52:16.667
default in 1963.
Have you ever heard of

00:52:16.667 --> 00:52:18.820
Studebaker?
None of you have heard of them?

00:52:18.820 --> 00:52:22.075
They made cars.
They were one of the big--I

00:52:22.075 --> 00:52:26.260
don't know how many carmakers in
the ‘50s and ‘60s.

00:52:26.260 --> 00:52:30.303
You probably still see these on
the road, but they're getting

00:52:30.303 --> 00:52:33.740
quite rare because that was
forty-five years ago.

00:52:33.740 --> 00:52:38.987
They were big for a while.
Anyway, the company went

00:52:38.987 --> 00:52:46.300
bankrupt in 1963 and now they
claimed to have funded a pension

00:52:46.300 --> 00:52:49.257
plan.
They were learning from GM and

00:52:49.257 --> 00:52:52.986
they were investing a pension
plan for their employees in

00:52:52.986 --> 00:52:56.250
assets that should have survived
a bankruptcy;

00:52:56.250 --> 00:52:59.519
so they thought.
After the bankruptcy,

00:52:59.519 --> 00:53:06.150
they found out that they had
underfunded the pension plan.

00:53:06.150 --> 00:53:13.070
That means that they didn't put
enough money in to pay what they

00:53:13.070 --> 00:53:18.123
promised to pay,
so while they had it they just

00:53:18.123 --> 00:53:23.195
didn't put enough in.
Then people started getting

00:53:23.195 --> 00:53:26.348
angry obviously;
people that worked their lives

00:53:26.348 --> 00:53:29.669
at Studebaker--they were told
that they had a funded pension

00:53:29.669 --> 00:53:32.043
fund.
When they--later they found

00:53:32.043 --> 00:53:35.820
that they got nothing or at
least very much reduced.

00:53:35.820 --> 00:53:42.380
People started looking at the
union, United Auto Workers.

00:53:42.380 --> 00:53:46.197
Isn't the United Auto Workers
supposed to stand up for the

00:53:46.197 --> 00:53:50.149
rights of the employees and
shouldn't they be looking at the

00:53:50.149 --> 00:53:54.570
pension fund and demanding that
Studebaker fund it adequately?

00:53:54.570 --> 00:53:58.059
Well, they were not--they were
asleep at the switch.

00:53:58.059 --> 00:54:03.015
Some people accuse the UAW of
complicity with Studebaker--that

00:54:03.015 --> 00:54:08.133
basically the UAW was not paying
attention to the distant future

00:54:08.133 --> 00:54:13.170
because they didn't think that
their members really cared.

00:54:13.170 --> 00:54:17.730
UAW wanted, when they had
negotiations with Studebaker,

00:54:17.730 --> 00:54:20.769
they wanted big pay increases
now;

00:54:20.769 --> 00:54:23.050
they didn't care about funding
the pension fund.

00:54:23.050 --> 00:54:26.602
Why didn't they care?
Well, because the workers at

00:54:26.602 --> 00:54:30.358
Studebaker didn't know or
understand this and so the

00:54:30.358 --> 00:54:33.010
workers were not attuned to
this.

00:54:33.010 --> 00:54:36.029
So, the union thrives on
getting something that looks

00:54:36.029 --> 00:54:39.165
valuable to the employees,
but the employees were being

00:54:39.165 --> 00:54:41.794
deceived.
Both Studebaker and the union

00:54:41.794 --> 00:54:45.349
were in it together against the
employees, in a sense;

00:54:45.349 --> 00:54:52.050
so, this created a lot of anger
about failures of pension funds.

00:54:52.050 --> 00:54:56.530
I'm talking about financial
crises of years past.

00:54:56.530 --> 00:55:01.277
We're going through a subprime
crisis right now and this is

00:55:01.277 --> 00:55:04.896
just one of a series.
Every time we have a financial

00:55:04.896 --> 00:55:07.813
crisis we make fixes.
In reaction to the

00:55:07.813 --> 00:55:13.291
Studebaker--it took ten years,
but the Studebaker default set

00:55:13.291 --> 00:55:18.769
in force a dialogue about how
pensions should be managed.

00:55:18.769 --> 00:55:25.945
That led to ERISA
1974--actually eleven years

00:55:25.945 --> 00:55:33.011
later.
ERISA stands for Employment

00:55:33.011 --> 00:55:46.241
Retirement Income Security Act
and it then required funding--it

00:55:46.241 --> 00:55:55.645
required adequate funding.
Studebaker had a funded pension

00:55:55.645 --> 00:56:01.869
plan, but it was underfunded,
so that's what ERISA created.

00:56:01.869 --> 00:56:13.692
They also created the Pension
Benefits Guarantee Corporation,

00:56:13.692 --> 00:56:19.986
the PBGC.
This is a government--well,

00:56:19.986 --> 00:56:28.393
it's a government-sponsored
enterprise that insures--the

00:56:28.393 --> 00:56:35.774
Pension Benefit Guarantee Corp.
It's like the Federal Deposit

00:56:35.774 --> 00:56:39.391
Insurance Corporation,
which guarantees your bank

00:56:39.391 --> 00:56:43.179
deposit;
it guarantees your pension plan.

00:56:43.179 --> 00:56:49.398
So, the PBGC then receives dues
from pension plans and the

00:56:49.398 --> 00:56:54.174
pension plans then,
if they were to fail,

00:56:54.174 --> 00:57:01.389
would get--the pensioners would
get a payment from the PBGC.

00:57:01.389 --> 00:57:06.648
The PBGC is supposed to monitor
the funds of pension plans--make

00:57:06.648 --> 00:57:09.820
sure that they're adequately
funded.

00:57:09.820 --> 00:57:16.341
Then if they are not adequately
funded, then they would make up

00:57:16.341 --> 00:57:20.565
the difference.
Now, ultimately the PBGC has a

00:57:20.565 --> 00:57:24.542
portfolio of assets,
which it accumulates from the

00:57:24.542 --> 00:57:27.789
fees paid to it by the pension
funds.

00:57:27.789 --> 00:57:33.082
That portfolio of assets might
not be adequate in a huge

00:57:33.082 --> 00:57:39.239
crisis, so Congress might have
to step in to support the PBGC;

00:57:39.239 --> 00:57:43.579
otherwise, the PBGC is not
taking taxpayers' money.

00:57:43.579 --> 00:57:47.109
Recently, the PBGC has come
under some attack because after

00:57:47.109 --> 00:57:50.883
the stock market--it's very hard
to know whether a pension fund

00:57:50.883 --> 00:57:54.048
is adequately funded or not
because it all depends on

00:57:54.048 --> 00:57:58.549
assumptions about asset prices.
During the run up of stock

00:57:58.549 --> 00:58:02.789
market in the 1990s,
firms started cutting back on

00:58:02.789 --> 00:58:07.981
the amount they contributed to
their retirement funds because

00:58:07.981 --> 00:58:13.000
the stock market had made their
plans look very rich.

00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:17.139
There are people like me
claiming that it was a bubble,

00:58:17.139 --> 00:58:20.973
so the prices were not going to
stay at this level,

00:58:20.973 --> 00:58:24.500
but it's kind of hard to prove
that point.

00:58:24.500 --> 00:58:29.109
So, companies in the late
‘90s were not--they were

00:58:29.109 --> 00:58:33.719
putting their money in risky
stocks and saying they were

00:58:33.719 --> 00:58:38.413
adequately-funded when there
were people like me who were

00:58:38.413 --> 00:58:42.554
doubting that.
The PBGC, being a government

00:58:42.554 --> 00:58:46.428
organization,
didn't protest--after the stock

00:58:46.428 --> 00:58:51.710
market came down after 2000,
it put the PBGC in jeopardy.

00:58:51.710 --> 00:58:53.829
Fortunately,
the market went back up again

00:58:53.829 --> 00:58:55.380
and kind of bailed them out.

00:58:59.519 --> 00:59:05.585
The ERISA Act also embodied
something called the Prudent

00:59:05.585 --> 00:59:10.242
Person Rule.
Actually, in 1974 they called

00:59:10.242 --> 00:59:16.683
it the Prudent Man Rule--that
was because '74 was just before

00:59:16.683 --> 00:59:20.869
we tried to use non-sexist
language.

00:59:20.869 --> 00:59:23.982
So, the Prudent Man Rule is now
the Prudent Person Rule,

00:59:23.982 --> 00:59:26.019
but I'll read what the ERISA
said.

00:59:26.019 --> 00:59:29.376
The Act said,
"Investments must be made with

00:59:29.376 --> 00:59:32.890
the care, skill,
prudence, and diligence under

00:59:32.890 --> 00:59:37.340
the circumstances then
prevailing that a prudent man,

00:59:37.340 --> 00:59:41.251
acting in a like capacity and
familiar with such matters,

00:59:41.251 --> 00:59:45.443
would use in the conduct of an
enterprise of a like character

00:59:45.443 --> 00:59:48.351
and with like aims."
That's lawyer-ese,

00:59:48.351 --> 00:59:52.251
but basically what they're
saying--the fundamental problem

00:59:52.251 --> 00:59:56.288
that even if you get beyond the
deliberate underfunding of a

00:59:56.288 --> 00:59:59.093
pension plan,
you still get the possibility

00:59:59.093 --> 01:00:02.132
that the pension managers will
do something wild like put

01:00:02.132 --> 01:00:05.172
everything in the stock market
or they could be leveraged

01:00:05.172 --> 01:00:08.089
investments in the stock market.
They could say,

01:00:08.089 --> 01:00:11.304
we're funded enough because
with this hugely-leveraged

01:00:11.304 --> 01:00:14.821
portfolio we should have enough
money, but that wouldn't be

01:00:14.821 --> 01:00:17.436
prudent.
If the government is

01:00:17.436 --> 01:00:22.549
guaranteeing pension plans as
they started doing with the

01:00:22.549 --> 01:00:25.161
PBGC,
then they've got to prevent

01:00:25.161 --> 01:00:28.924
that because they can't just let
companies just do wild

01:00:28.924 --> 01:00:32.015
investments.
This put the government in a

01:00:32.015 --> 01:00:36.472
funny circumstance because it
was starting to tell these funds

01:00:36.472 --> 01:00:39.980
that they had to be doing
sensible investing.

01:00:39.980 --> 01:00:43.398
What is sensible investing?
It actually was a difficult

01:00:43.398 --> 01:00:46.070
thing to define.
Look at Yale University.

01:00:46.070 --> 01:00:49.512
Back in--when David Swensen
came to Yale,

01:00:49.512 --> 01:00:53.386
most universities put their
money in sensible,

01:00:53.386 --> 01:00:58.349
safe, government bonds;
stocks were considered risky.

01:00:58.349 --> 01:01:01.369
But Swensen said,
no let's not do that;

01:01:01.369 --> 01:01:04.295
let's put into these strange,
alternative investments and

01:01:04.295 --> 01:01:06.490
after the fact he turns out to
be right.

01:01:06.490 --> 01:01:10.177
Was he not prudent?
Do you want to tell investment

01:01:10.177 --> 01:01:12.320
companies that they shouldn't do
that?

01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:15.688
It's a difficult question and
the question is:

01:01:15.688 --> 01:01:19.432
how far should a pension plan
go in taking on risky

01:01:19.432 --> 01:01:22.474
investments?
The law created this strange

01:01:22.474 --> 01:01:25.701
Prudent Person Rule,
which says that an investment

01:01:25.701 --> 01:01:29.389
company should do whatever a
prudent person would do;

01:01:29.389 --> 01:01:33.638
it created an unfortunate
environment for pension fund

01:01:33.638 --> 01:01:36.010
management.
Basically, they're telling

01:01:36.010 --> 01:01:38.670
pension fund managers,
don't use your own judgment;

01:01:38.670 --> 01:01:42.510
do what somebody else would do
and you manage the portfolio.

01:01:42.510 --> 01:01:46.070
I mean, that's law;
you've got to do this.

01:01:46.070 --> 01:01:53.132
It's in the law as a manager,
so it's a slippery business to

01:01:53.132 --> 01:01:55.183
be in.
I have on the--I don't expect

01:01:55.183 --> 01:01:57.369
you to go to read this because
it should be in the library,

01:01:57.369 --> 01:01:58.613
but O'Barr &amp;
Conley [Willam M.

01:01:58.613 --> 01:02:00.385
O'Barr and John M.
Conley, Fortune and Folly:

01:02:00.385 --> 01:02:02.610
The Wealth and Power of
Institutional Investing,

01:02:02.610 --> 01:02:05.205
Homewood Illinois:
Business One Irwin,

01:02:05.205 --> 01:02:07.731
1992]
wondered how pension funds deal

01:02:07.731 --> 01:02:11.380
with this strange situation that
they're put in.

01:02:11.380 --> 01:02:16.110
This is O'Barr &amp;
Conley, who wrote a book.

01:02:16.110 --> 01:02:18.275
One of these is an
anthropologist,

01:02:18.275 --> 01:02:21.949
so we're getting a little bit
of insight--I mentioned,

01:02:21.949 --> 01:02:23.914
I like to take insights from
all the different social

01:02:23.914 --> 01:02:26.677
sciences.
Anthropologists like to go into

01:02:26.677 --> 01:02:31.070
some primitive village somewhere
in the world and interview

01:02:31.070 --> 01:02:35.083
people who live in a very
different culture and try to

01:02:35.083 --> 01:02:39.072
learn about them.
What an anthropologist does is

01:02:39.072 --> 01:02:43.562
goes into some village and
doesn't disturb their--tries not

01:02:43.562 --> 01:02:47.288
to disturb their culture;
doesn't start explaining

01:02:47.288 --> 01:02:51.250
things, just listens and tries
to understand how they think;

01:02:51.250 --> 01:02:55.905
has to learn their language and
listen to their--presumably to

01:02:55.905 --> 01:03:00.102
get insights about human
behavior from the experience of

01:03:00.102 --> 01:03:03.460
immersing oneself in some other
culture.

01:03:03.460 --> 01:03:10.984
These people went to interview
pension fund managers with the

01:03:10.984 --> 01:03:17.505
same techniques that
anthropologists use in primitive

01:03:17.505 --> 01:03:25.029
villages and they concluded that
pension funds are--they were

01:03:25.029 --> 01:03:29.920
rather critical of pension
funds.

01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:33.882
The pension funds are living in
this strange world created by

01:03:33.882 --> 01:03:38.110
ERISA, which requires that they
behave as somebody else would.

01:03:38.110 --> 01:03:45.320
It kind of separates them from
any real sense of their mission;

01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:50.398
they're regulated so heavily.
So, what O'Barr &amp;

01:03:50.398 --> 01:03:54.710
Conley found is that--they
engaged people in discussion;

01:03:54.710 --> 01:03:59.423
they listed to what managers of
pension funds would say on their

01:03:59.423 --> 01:04:03.239
own without suggesting the topic
of conversation.

01:04:03.239 --> 01:04:07.960
What they found was that
managers were very much aware of

01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:12.932
the Prudent Person Rule and that
they were always looking to

01:04:12.932 --> 01:04:17.640
shift blame--possible blame.
They were also thinking of some

01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:21.078
lawsuit that they could
eventually be embroiled in and

01:04:21.078 --> 01:04:24.707
they were always saying,
well this is what a prudent

01:04:24.707 --> 01:04:28.349
person would do.
They talked a lot about the law

01:04:28.349 --> 01:04:33.029
and relatively little about
economics or the objectives that

01:04:33.029 --> 01:04:37.867
they're supposed to have about
how do we get to the management

01:04:37.867 --> 01:04:42.071
of--how do we manage this
portfolio to provide for the

01:04:42.071 --> 01:04:45.800
benefits to our employees in the
future.

01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:49.103
It's interesting that as
anthropologists,

01:04:49.103 --> 01:04:53.315
they took note of what
anthropologists have noted in

01:04:53.315 --> 01:04:58.320
many primitive societies.
If you let people living in

01:04:58.320 --> 01:05:03.929
some isolated culture talk,
they tend to come up eventually

01:05:03.929 --> 01:05:07.641
with a creation myth.
This is a term that

01:05:07.641 --> 01:05:10.932
anthropologists use;
every primitive society--you

01:05:10.932 --> 01:05:13.309
can ask them,
where did it all start?

01:05:13.309 --> 01:05:18.644
They will generally have a
story about the creation of

01:05:18.644 --> 01:05:22.570
their little village or their
people,

01:05:22.570 --> 01:05:29.710
which involves some great man
or god that founded everything.

01:05:29.710 --> 01:05:35.136
There's some story about this
person and a sense that we are

01:05:35.136 --> 01:05:40.747
the chosen people--that we're
the--we have some values or--and

01:05:40.747 --> 01:05:45.990
it's built around a story of
some great man or woman,

01:05:45.990 --> 01:05:48.231
I suppose.
What they said was,

01:05:48.231 --> 01:05:52.167
that's one of the things they
heard most commonly--the

01:05:52.167 --> 01:05:54.494
creation myth.
So, they would say,

01:05:54.494 --> 01:05:57.800
our pension fund was started by
so and so forty years ago;

01:05:57.800 --> 01:06:00.934
this person had great insights
and we're living in this

01:06:00.934 --> 01:06:02.270
tradition ever since.

01:06:14.869 --> 01:06:21.050
Anyway, ERISA came in at more
or less the end of era.

01:06:21.050 --> 01:06:24.239
There are really two kinds of
pension plans;

01:06:24.239 --> 01:06:35.680
there is defined benefit and
defined contribution.

01:06:42.630 --> 01:06:43.920
There's a fundamental
difference.

01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:49.354
A defined benefit pension plan
tells you that the pension will

01:06:49.354 --> 01:06:52.867
pay you a certain amount.
For example,

01:06:52.867 --> 01:06:57.769
I mentioned the very first U.S.
pension fund--American Express.

01:06:57.769 --> 01:07:02.042
It promised to pay you 50% of
your average pay for the last

01:07:02.042 --> 01:07:04.619
ten years that you were
employed.

01:07:04.619 --> 01:07:09.791
You were told this when you
started the job that this was

01:07:09.791 --> 01:07:14.869
your plan, so that defined the
benefit you would get.

01:07:14.869 --> 01:07:20.847
Until 1974, virtually all
pension plans were defined

01:07:20.847 --> 01:07:23.768
benefit.
There were some exceptions,

01:07:23.768 --> 01:07:25.969
but it was the overwhelming
norm.

01:07:25.969 --> 01:07:28.969
Labor unions liked defined
benefit;

01:07:28.969 --> 01:07:33.549
it sounded right to them,
but the contrary kind is called

01:07:33.549 --> 01:07:37.436
defined contribution.
In a defined contribution plan,

01:07:37.436 --> 01:07:41.059
the pension plan does not
promise you anything about what

01:07:41.059 --> 01:07:45.669
your retirement income will be.
They merely say that we are

01:07:45.669 --> 01:07:50.936
going to contribute a fraction
of your salary to a portfolio

01:07:50.936 --> 01:07:56.469
that will be managed to provide
you income when you retire.

01:07:56.469 --> 01:08:02.002
The amount you get will be
determined by the portfolio and

01:08:02.002 --> 01:08:06.815
not by any arbitrary rule.
There's nothing like 50% of the

01:08:06.815 --> 01:08:11.799
last ten years of your income.
The defined contribution plans

01:08:11.799 --> 01:08:15.170
got their biggest impetus in
1981.

01:08:15.170 --> 01:08:19.474
So that's what,
seven years after ERISA with

01:08:19.474 --> 01:08:23.979
the advent of what was called
401(k) plans.

01:08:23.979 --> 01:08:29.865
401(k) is a paragraph in the
Internal Revenue Service

01:08:29.865 --> 01:08:35.978
Code--that's the tax--that's the
IRS, the agency of the

01:08:35.978 --> 01:08:44.361
government that taxes everyone.
Section 401(k) of the IRS Code

01:08:44.361 --> 01:08:53.352
defined circumstances in which
money held in trusts for others

01:08:53.352 --> 01:08:59.902
might not be taxable.
In 1981, for the first time,

01:08:59.902 --> 01:09:05.498
a company invoked this clause
to ask that the defined

01:09:05.498 --> 01:09:12.600
contribution plan that they were
setting up would not be taxed.

01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:15.749
Well actually,
to make it clear,

01:09:15.749 --> 01:09:20.931
what it would be is if the
employer or employee made

01:09:20.931 --> 01:09:25.860
contributions to the plan,
then there would be no

01:09:25.860 --> 01:09:30.563
tax--that would be a tax
deduction for the amount of the

01:09:30.563 --> 01:09:35.180
contribution until later--after
the person retires.

01:09:35.180 --> 01:09:38.967
It would be taxed many years
later as ordinary income when

01:09:38.967 --> 01:09:42.213
they received it.
By postponing the tax,

01:09:42.213 --> 01:09:45.460
it was a significant tax
advantage.

01:09:45.460 --> 01:09:50.602
After 1981, there was a
tremendous revolution in our

01:09:50.602 --> 01:09:56.449
tax--in our pension system
because it led--first of all,

01:09:56.449 --> 01:09:59.649
people liked tax breaks and it
sounds good to get a tax break.

01:09:59.649 --> 01:10:04.278
But secondly,
people start--unions were

01:10:04.278 --> 01:10:07.065
declining.
Unions, which had always

01:10:07.065 --> 01:10:10.102
advocated defined benefits,
were declining as a force in

01:10:10.102 --> 01:10:12.427
the U.S.
and people were developing in

01:10:12.427 --> 01:10:15.329
the United States more of an
investment culture.

01:10:15.329 --> 01:10:18.534
They liked the idea that they
would have a defined

01:10:18.534 --> 01:10:22.000
contribution plan where there
would be a portfolio,

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:25.087
which is theirs,
which is being invested for

01:10:25.087 --> 01:10:28.389
their retirement,
rather than trust the company

01:10:28.389 --> 01:10:31.189
to provide a benefit in
retirement.

01:10:31.189 --> 01:10:35.743
The general public showed a
strong preference for defined

01:10:35.743 --> 01:10:40.540
contribution plans after 1981
and so that is a big force.

01:10:40.540 --> 01:10:43.511
The U.S.
was a leader in defined

01:10:43.511 --> 01:10:46.414
contribution plans,
but it is now spreading all

01:10:46.414 --> 01:10:49.649
over the world.
I think it again reflects the

01:10:49.649 --> 01:10:54.641
change in our world culture.
So, they're growing in Europe

01:10:54.641 --> 01:10:59.527
and other--I guess
Mexico's--Chile--so many of the

01:10:59.527 --> 01:11:04.312
pension plans now are of the
defined contribution

01:11:04.312 --> 01:11:08.699
variety--even government pension
plans.

01:11:08.699 --> 01:11:13.641
The government social security
plan in Chile invests for you

01:11:13.641 --> 01:11:17.996
and there's a portfolio and you
can get on a website,

01:11:17.996 --> 01:11:21.020
I understand.
I've never done it in Chile,

01:11:21.020 --> 01:11:24.050
but you can see what the
balance is in your account.

01:11:24.050 --> 01:11:27.622
Another thing that defined
contribution plans began to do

01:11:27.622 --> 01:11:30.939
with the advent of 401(k) is
they would allow you,

01:11:30.939 --> 01:11:36.666
as an employee or as the
pensioner, to choose the general

01:11:36.666 --> 01:11:41.501
categories of investments.
That would typically--in a

01:11:41.501 --> 01:11:46.279
defined contribution plan after
1981, there would be a number of

01:11:46.279 --> 01:11:50.829
mutual funds that you could
invest your pension money in.

01:11:50.829 --> 01:11:54.443
Though you couldn't take it out
until you retired,

01:11:54.443 --> 01:11:58.352
you could choose which,
from a selected list of mutual

01:11:58.352 --> 01:12:01.449
funds, you could invest your
money in.

01:12:01.449 --> 01:12:05.203
This helped promote mutual
funds dramatically and it also

01:12:05.203 --> 01:12:08.890
created more of an investment
culture in our society.

01:12:08.890 --> 01:12:16.914
That's where we are now.
The defined benefit pension

01:12:16.914 --> 01:12:21.018
plan is declining rapidly;
ERISA is still not irrelevant

01:12:21.018 --> 01:12:24.584
because they're still important,
but ERISA is becoming less and

01:12:24.584 --> 01:12:27.364
less important.
We're moving on toward a

01:12:27.364 --> 01:12:31.798
country--when you get your first
job, the first thing you will

01:12:31.798 --> 01:12:35.069
get, I can predict,
will be a 401(k) plan;

01:12:35.069 --> 01:12:41.000
you will probably not be given
a defined benefit pension.

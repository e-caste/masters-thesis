00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:05.686
Professor Shelly Kagan:
At the end of last class,

00:00:05.686 --> 00:00:09.848
I quoted some words from Kurt
Vonnegut, a kind of deathbed

00:00:09.848 --> 00:00:14.083
prayer confession that he'd
written in one of his novels in

00:00:14.083 --> 00:00:18.830
which the basic gist of the
prayer is to express gratitude.

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.158
Whatever the content of your
life, the fact that at least

00:00:22.158 --> 00:00:24.833
you've been able to live at
all--As he put it,

00:00:24.833 --> 00:00:27.330
most mud isn't lucky enough to
sit up.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.940
He feels lucky to have been
some of the sitting-up mud.

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:35.220
He loved everything he saw.
When I read that quote,

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.413
I did not know that Kurt
Vonnegut had died the night

00:00:38.413 --> 00:00:41.029
before.
Immediately after the class

00:00:41.029 --> 00:00:44.861
ended, a visitor to the class
brought this fact to my

00:00:44.861 --> 00:00:47.461
attention.
So, I can't pass without

00:00:47.461 --> 00:00:51.018
commenting on that death,
and just remark that I hope

00:00:51.018 --> 00:00:54.015
that to the very end,
Kurt Vonnegut,

00:00:54.015 --> 00:00:59.535
who lived until he was 84,
realized how lucky he was to be

00:00:59.535 --> 00:01:05.349
some of the sitting-up mud.
The question I want to turn to

00:01:05.349 --> 00:01:08.757
now is this.
So, we've been going over the

00:01:08.757 --> 00:01:12.459
various facts about the nature
of life and death.

00:01:12.459 --> 00:01:15.274
And the question then is,
how should we live,

00:01:15.274 --> 00:01:18.280
in light of the fact that we're
going to die?

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.173
Previously, we've talked about
what emotional response we

00:01:21.173 --> 00:01:23.369
should have to that.
And I've argued,

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.811
as I just reminded us,
that although perhaps the most

00:01:26.811 --> 00:01:30.319
common reaction is one of fear
or terror at death,

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:34.140
it may in fact be that we
should be grateful and consider

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.688
ourselves lucky that we were
able to have had life as

00:01:37.688 --> 00:01:39.962
well--life at all.
But how, then,

00:01:39.962 --> 00:01:43.330
should we live in light of the
fact that we're going to die?

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:48.060
And the immediate answer that
comes to mind seems almost like

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.572
a joke.
I want to say,

00:01:49.572 --> 00:01:51.464
well, we should be
careful,

00:01:51.464 --> 00:01:53.930
given that we can die,
that we will die.

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.259
There used to be a TV show,
a cop show called Hill

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:59.260
Street Blues.
The show began every day with

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.597
the sergeant going over the
various crimes and

00:02:02.597 --> 00:02:07.269
investigations that were going
to fill up the day's episode.

00:02:07.269 --> 00:02:10.134
And he'd always end,
as he sent off his police,

00:02:10.134 --> 00:02:12.327
the cops.
He'd end by saying,

00:02:12.327 --> 00:02:15.500
"Be careful" or "Be careful out
there."

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.136
But the particular kind of care
that I have in mind isn't just

00:02:19.136 --> 00:02:21.455
this pure fact,
that if you're not careful,

00:02:21.455 --> 00:02:24.210
you won't notice that the car's
coming down the street and

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.530
you'll hit by the car and
that'll be the end.

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.763
The fact that we're going to
die intuitively seems to require

00:02:29.763 --> 00:02:31.650
a particular kind of
care,

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.186
because, as we might put it,
you only go around once,

00:02:35.186 --> 00:02:38.259
right?
You don't get to do it again.

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:41.052
And so, it seems as though the
fact that we're mortal,

00:02:41.052 --> 00:02:43.370
the fact that we've got a
finite lifespan,

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.550
requires us to face the fact
that intuitively we can blow it.

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:53.208
We could do it wrong.
Now, the nitpicky part of me

00:02:53.208 --> 00:02:56.211
wants to point out that it can't
be mortality,

00:02:56.211 --> 00:02:58.680
per se, that has this
implication.

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.180
Even if we lived forever,
we could still do it wrong.

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.289
After all, whatever it is
you've filled your life with,

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:09.911
with an immortal infinite life,
there's still going to be the

00:03:09.911 --> 00:03:13.413
particular pattern of actions
and activities that you engage

00:03:13.413 --> 00:03:15.543
in.
And that particular pattern

00:03:15.543 --> 00:03:19.156
could still be one that wasn't
the best pattern that was

00:03:19.156 --> 00:03:22.584
available to you.
So, the possibility of having

00:03:22.584 --> 00:03:26.229
blown it, of having lived the
wrong kind of life,

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:29.861
is a possibility that's going
to be true of us,

00:03:29.861 --> 00:03:34.022
whether or not we're mortal.
And yet, for all that,

00:03:34.022 --> 00:03:37.851
it seems as though mortality
adds an extra risk,

00:03:37.851 --> 00:03:42.060
an extra danger of blowing it.
Look, suppose we lived forever

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.289
and just have a kind of
simplistic example.

00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:48.325
You might say,
imagine somebody who spends his

00:03:48.325 --> 00:03:51.464
eternity counting the
integers--1,2,

00:03:51.464 --> 00:03:54.364
3,4, 5,6.
Well, that might not be as

00:03:54.364 --> 00:03:57.698
valuable as an eternity spent
doing something else,

00:03:57.698 --> 00:04:00.500
let's say, doing more
complicated math.

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.095
But still, if you've spent a
million years or a billion years

00:04:04.095 --> 00:04:07.391
counting the integers and then
realized that was sort of

00:04:07.391 --> 00:04:10.778
pointless,
you could always start over by

00:04:10.778 --> 00:04:14.940
doing more interesting,
more deep, more worthwhile

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.956
math.
The immortality gives you a

00:04:17.956 --> 00:04:22.600
chance of starting over.
It gives you the possibility of

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.581
do-overs.
We might then worry that what's

00:04:25.581 --> 00:04:29.381
especially bad about death,
the fact that we're mortal,

00:04:29.381 --> 00:04:32.759
is that it robs us of the
chance of do-overs.

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:35.170
But of course,
that's not quite right either.

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:39.723
Even if you don't live forever,
you live 80 years or 100 years,

00:04:39.723 --> 00:04:43.616
you have the chance to
reappraise your life at the age

00:04:43.616 --> 00:04:47.949
of 20 or 30 or 50 and decide you
need to change course.

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:53.162
So, it's not exactly as though
the possibility of do-overs

00:04:53.162 --> 00:04:57.459
disappears by death itself,
via death itself.

00:04:57.459 --> 00:05:01.548
Still, the thought that death
comes when it does seems to push

00:05:01.548 --> 00:05:05.369
us in the direction of thinking
we've still got to be very

00:05:05.369 --> 00:05:08.740
careful because,
of course, given that we're

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:13.176
mortal, we have only a limited
period of time in which to do

00:05:13.176 --> 00:05:15.572
the do-overs.
There are two kinds of

00:05:15.572 --> 00:05:18.064
mistakes, really,
that we might catch ourselves

00:05:18.064 --> 00:05:19.912
in.
We might discover,

00:05:19.912 --> 00:05:23.720
on the one hand,
that we made some bad choices

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.019
in terms of what we were aiming
for.

00:05:27.019 --> 00:05:29.405
And on the other hand,
we might find even if we made

00:05:29.405 --> 00:05:31.370
the right choices in terms of
our goals,

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:34.941
we flubbed it in terms of
actually accomplishing what we

00:05:34.941 --> 00:05:39.104
were trying to accomplish.
And so we literally have to

00:05:39.104 --> 00:05:41.970
start over again,
and try again.

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:46.399
So, there's two kinds of care
that we have to take.

00:05:46.399 --> 00:05:51.255
We have to be careful in our
aims and we have to be careful

00:05:51.255 --> 00:05:54.820
in our execution of our aims,
because we have,

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:58.399
as it were, a rather limited
amount of time to do it over.

00:05:58.399 --> 00:06:02.016
Now, again, the nitpicky part
of me wants to say strictly

00:06:02.016 --> 00:06:05.180
speaking, it's not the fact that
we are mortal,

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:10.516
per se, that all by itself
means we have to be especially

00:06:10.516 --> 00:06:13.745
careful.
After all, suppose there just

00:06:13.745 --> 00:06:17.040
weren't all that many things
worth doing.

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:21.335
And suppose they weren't all
that complicated,

00:06:21.335 --> 00:06:25.381
all that difficult to do well.
Suppose there were only

00:06:25.381 --> 00:06:28.334
five things worth doing.
And even if you couldn't

00:06:28.334 --> 00:06:32.205
necessarily do every single one
of them right the first time

00:06:32.205 --> 00:06:35.420
out, at most it would take two
or three tries.

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:40.029
And by a try I mean maybe an
hour or two.

00:06:40.029 --> 00:06:43.065
Well, that would be a pretty
impoverished world that could

00:06:43.065 --> 00:06:45.332
only offer us that much.
But after all,

00:06:45.332 --> 00:06:48.864
if that was the way the world
worked and we had a hundred

00:06:48.864 --> 00:06:52.521
years, we wouldn't really have
to worry all that much about

00:06:52.521 --> 00:06:56.367
being careful.
We'd have plenty of time to aim

00:06:56.367 --> 00:07:01.321
for each of the five things
worth having and plenty of time

00:07:01.321 --> 00:07:05.079
to get each one of the five
things right.

00:07:05.079 --> 00:07:08.530
A hundred years of life would
be more than enough.

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:12.865
We wouldn't have to be careful.
So, it's not just the fact that

00:07:12.865 --> 00:07:17.170
we're mortal that requires us to
be careful.

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:23.418
It's the fact that we have a
relatively short span of life

00:07:23.418 --> 00:07:28.790
relative to how much there is
worth aiming for,

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:34.369
and how complicated and
difficult it can be to get those

00:07:34.369 --> 00:07:40.193
things and get them right.
It's because of the fact that

00:07:40.193 --> 00:07:46.468
there's so much to do and doing
it properly that we have to be

00:07:46.468 --> 00:07:49.554
careful.
We just don't have enough time

00:07:49.554 --> 00:07:51.966
to flail around,
try a little of this,

00:07:51.966 --> 00:07:55.994
try a little of that.
Somebody who lives like that

00:07:55.994 --> 00:08:01.099
may well find that the things
they aimed for weren't really

00:08:01.099 --> 00:08:04.735
the best choices.
You don't have to decide that

00:08:04.735 --> 00:08:07.322
these things weren't worth
having at all,

00:08:07.322 --> 00:08:10.879
given the relatively short
period of time we've got.

00:08:10.879 --> 00:08:15.574
We've got the extra burden of
deciding what are the things

00:08:15.574 --> 00:08:19.806
most worth going after.
And we have to face the

00:08:19.806 --> 00:08:22.931
prospect, the chance,
that we'll look back and

00:08:22.931 --> 00:08:26.750
discover that we didn't make the
best choices there.

00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:29.692
We aimed for the wrong things,
not necessarily things that

00:08:29.692 --> 00:08:32.590
weren't worth having,
but given the limited number of

00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:35.679
things we were going to be able
to fill our lives with,

00:08:35.679 --> 00:08:38.929
in that sense,
the wrong choices.

00:08:38.929 --> 00:08:42.979
And we may discover as well
that we were not sufficiently

00:08:42.979 --> 00:08:47.389
careful, attentive in how we
tried to achieve these things.

00:08:47.389 --> 00:08:50.319
Because it's not as
though--although given the way

00:08:50.319 --> 00:08:52.890
life is, you've got the chance
for do-overs,

00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:56.000
you don't have time for a whole
lot of do-overs.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.610
And so what death forces us to
do is, to be careful.

00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:06.050
An analogy that comes to mind
here is an artist who goes--a

00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:09.419
musician who goes into a
recording studio.

00:09:09.419 --> 00:09:13.233
And look, he can start trying
to record his songs to cut an

00:09:13.233 --> 00:09:16.256
album.
And he may only have a certain

00:09:16.256 --> 00:09:19.169
number of songs in his
repertoire.

00:09:19.169 --> 00:09:22.297
And so if he's got a long
enough period of time,

00:09:22.297 --> 00:09:24.559
a month in the recording
studio,

00:09:24.559 --> 00:09:28.934
he's got plenty of time,
or she's got plenty of time,

00:09:28.934 --> 00:09:32.294
to sing a couple of songs.
Maybe these wouldn't be the

00:09:32.294 --> 00:09:35.504
best things to record.
Let's give it a try and we'll

00:09:35.504 --> 00:09:37.244
see.
Didn't get it right the first

00:09:37.244 --> 00:09:38.640
take.
Let's record it again.

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:41.690
Let's try it a third time.
Let's try it a fourth time.

00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:46.572
If you've got enough time,
it's less pressing to get clear

00:09:46.572 --> 00:09:49.978
before you start,
or as you're going along,

00:09:49.978 --> 00:09:54.316
what are the songs I should try
to record, and can I get it on

00:09:54.316 --> 00:09:56.659
one take,
or at most two?

00:09:56.659 --> 00:10:00.155
But if instead of having a
month in the recording studio,

00:10:00.155 --> 00:10:02.590
you've got only a week in the
studio,

00:10:02.590 --> 00:10:07.474
or a day in the studio,
suddenly everything's much more

00:10:07.474 --> 00:10:12.879
pressing.
Time is much more precious.

00:10:12.879 --> 00:10:17.594
You've got to decide early on
just which are the songs that it

00:10:17.594 --> 00:10:21.038
makes sense to record?
And yeah, there are some other

00:10:21.038 --> 00:10:23.580
songs, but these seem to be the
better choices.

00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:26.698
And when you record them,
you can't be as careless and

00:10:26.698 --> 00:10:29.169
inattentive as you try to get
them down.

00:10:29.169 --> 00:10:32.700
You've got to try to get it
right the first time,

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:34.980
or at worst,
the second time.

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:38.506
That's, it seems to me,
the situation we find ourselves

00:10:38.506 --> 00:10:41.250
in, not just given the fact that
we die,

00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:45.821
but, we might say,
given how incredibly rich the

00:10:45.821 --> 00:10:49.809
world is, how many things it
offers us,

00:10:49.809 --> 00:10:54.556
how many choices we have in
terms of what's worth going

00:10:54.556 --> 00:10:57.473
after.
But for many of these things,

00:10:57.473 --> 00:11:02.129
given how difficult they are to
accomplish, although we've got

00:11:02.129 --> 00:11:06.023
the chance for do-overs,
both in terms of changing our

00:11:06.023 --> 00:11:09.690
mind about what we should be
aiming at, and trying again,

00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:14.414
for the things we have
aimed at, we've got to be

00:11:14.414 --> 00:11:17.544
careful.
The fact about our death

00:11:17.544 --> 00:11:22.509
requires paying attention.
It requires care.

00:11:22.509 --> 00:11:24.334
Well, having said that,
of course, the immediate

00:11:24.334 --> 00:11:25.382
question then,
is all right,

00:11:25.382 --> 00:11:28.820
so I'm paying attention.
I'm trying to be careful.

00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:31.450
What should I do with my
life?

00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:34.970
How shall I--What should I fill
it with?

00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:38.322
We've, previously in the class,
talked about the possibility

00:11:38.322 --> 00:11:41.049
that being alive,
per se, may have some value.

00:11:41.049 --> 00:11:44.522
But above and beyond whatever
stand we take on that,

00:11:44.522 --> 00:11:48.404
it's certainly also the case
that part of what adds to the

00:11:48.404 --> 00:11:52.490
value of our lives are the
contents of our lives.

00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:57.574
And so we need to ask,
well, what kinds of contents

00:11:57.574 --> 00:12:01.540
should we try to fill our lives
with?

00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:06.280
Now, I won't try to answer that.
To ask the question,

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:10.789
what are the things really
worth going after in life?

00:12:10.789 --> 00:12:14.436
is to come up to the edge of
asking, well,

00:12:14.436 --> 00:12:17.550
just what is the meaning of
life?

00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:23.045
What's really worth going after?
And although that is indeed an

00:12:23.045 --> 00:12:25.870
important, perhaps the
important question,

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:28.990
it's the question,
I think, for a different class.

00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:33.041
And so having come close to the
edge of that question,

00:12:33.041 --> 00:12:35.870
I'm going to now back away from
it.

00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:39.809
But still, it seems we might
say, in broad strokes,

00:12:39.809 --> 00:12:44.299
there are two different
strategies that we could adopt.

00:12:44.299 --> 00:12:47.883
And it's worth at least pausing
to think about these two

00:12:47.883 --> 00:12:52.029
strategies.
Strategy number one says given

00:12:52.029 --> 00:12:58.190
that you've only got a finite
amount of time--Actually,

00:12:58.190 --> 00:13:01.732
the basic underlying thought
behind both strategies is just

00:13:01.732 --> 00:13:03.480
this.
We haven't got much time.

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:07.120
Pack as much as you can into
life.

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:11.076
Pack as much as you can in.
But there are two basic

00:13:11.076 --> 00:13:14.389
strategies about how do you put
that idea into practice.

00:13:14.389 --> 00:13:23.496
And strategy number one says
given the dangers of failure if

00:13:23.496 --> 00:13:30.098
you aim too ambitiously,
you should settle for the kinds

00:13:30.098 --> 00:13:34.440
of goals that you're virtually
guaranteed that you'll

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:39.963
accomplish.
The pleasures of food,

00:13:39.963 --> 00:13:44.909
company, sex,
ice cream.

00:13:44.909 --> 00:13:47.871
One of the paper topics asks
you to reflect on the

00:13:47.871 --> 00:13:50.108
philosophy, "Eat,
drink, and be merry,

00:13:50.108 --> 00:13:53.178
for tomorrow you die."
Well, that's one of the

00:13:53.178 --> 00:13:56.570
strategies.
We're going to be dead tomorrow.

00:13:56.570 --> 00:14:01.512
And so while we're here,
let's try to pack in as much as

00:14:01.512 --> 00:14:06.634
we can, by going for the things
that we've got a very high

00:14:06.634 --> 00:14:09.960
chance of actually
accomplishing.

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:15.519
Strategy number two says that's
all well and good.

00:14:15.519 --> 00:14:19.740
You've got a pretty high chance
of succeeding at that.

00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:25.203
The trouble with strategy
number one is the goods that you

00:14:25.203 --> 00:14:30.379
can achieve, the sort of sure
thing goods are small.

00:14:30.379 --> 00:14:35.059
They're rather small potatoes,
as things go.

00:14:35.059 --> 00:14:40.009
Some of the most valuable goods
in life are things that don't

00:14:40.009 --> 00:14:43.722
come so readily,
don't come with guarantees of

00:14:43.722 --> 00:14:47.508
achieving them.
You might want to write a

00:14:47.508 --> 00:14:52.567
novel, compose a symphony,
or for that matter raise--marry

00:14:52.567 --> 00:14:56.169
and raise a family.
Some of these things,

00:14:56.169 --> 00:15:00.959
strat--fans of strategy number
two argue, these things are the

00:15:00.959 --> 00:15:04.649
most valuable things that life
can offer us.

00:15:04.649 --> 00:15:10.127
So that a life filled with
these larger goods is a more

00:15:10.127 --> 00:15:16.720
valuable life than a life filled
with the small potatoes goods.

00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:19.382
I suppose fans of the "Eat,
drink, and be merry" strategy

00:15:19.382 --> 00:15:21.759
don't like to call those "small
potatoes goods,"

00:15:21.759 --> 00:15:26.229
but that's the kind of language
that might be offered by fans of

00:15:26.229 --> 00:15:29.864
strategy number two.
And it seems to me that as a

00:15:29.864 --> 00:15:32.976
claim about which life,
if only you had it,

00:15:32.976 --> 00:15:36.830
if you had a guarantee--If God
were going to say,

00:15:36.830 --> 00:15:39.230
"Look, which life do you want?
I promise you'll get it.

00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:44.351
The life filled with food and
drink or the life filled with

00:15:44.351 --> 00:15:49.120
accomplishment?"--perhaps most
of us would say well,

00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:52.644
it's the life filled with
accomplishment that's the more

00:15:52.644 --> 00:15:54.417
valuable life.
The trouble,

00:15:54.417 --> 00:15:56.845
of course, is,
the life with the greater

00:15:56.845 --> 00:15:59.522
accomplishments,
the life aiming for greater

00:15:59.522 --> 00:16:03.989
accomplishments,
is also a life with a greater

00:16:03.989 --> 00:16:08.053
chance of failure.
You aim for writing the great

00:16:08.053 --> 00:16:11.628
American novel and ten years
later, you still haven't

00:16:11.628 --> 00:16:14.074
finished it.
Twenty years later,

00:16:14.074 --> 00:16:18.690
you decide you don't have it in
you to write the great American

00:16:18.690 --> 00:16:22.272
novel.
You try to produce a business

00:16:22.272 --> 00:16:28.186
and it goes under.
So, what's the right strategy

00:16:28.186 --> 00:16:31.101
to take?
I suppose many of us would be

00:16:31.101 --> 00:16:33.580
inclined to say,
well, the third strategy.

00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:38.944
There's a third strategy that's
the obviously right thing to do,

00:16:38.944 --> 00:16:41.840
which is, get the right
mixture.

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:45.620
Aim for a certain number
of--what should we call them?

00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:50.082
Large potatoes.
Aim for a certain number of the

00:16:50.082 --> 00:16:53.335
large accomplishments,
because if you do manage to get

00:16:53.335 --> 00:16:55.789
them, your life will have more
value.

00:16:55.789 --> 00:16:59.568
But also throw in a certain
sprinkling of the smaller

00:16:59.568 --> 00:17:03.420
things, where you're at least
assured of having gotten

00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:07.644
something out of life.
Well, that's all well and good

00:17:07.644 --> 00:17:12.079
as well, but it just now brings
us to the next question.

00:17:12.079 --> 00:17:18.109
What is the right mixture,
after all?

00:17:18.109 --> 00:17:21.440
Well, I'm not going to try to
answer that one either.

00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:23.435
But again, those of you who
choose the topic,

00:17:23.435 --> 00:17:25.339
the "Eat, drink,
and be merry" question,

00:17:25.339 --> 00:17:28.464
basically I'm inviting you,
in that topic,

00:17:28.464 --> 00:17:32.910
to reflect on that question.
Here's a different thought.

00:17:32.910 --> 00:17:36.739
The entire, as I said,
the underlying thought behind

00:17:36.739 --> 00:17:40.493
the go-for-the-big-things,
go-for-the-small-things,

00:17:40.493 --> 00:17:44.893
was pack it all in.
The underlying thoughts seem to

00:17:44.893 --> 00:17:49.808
be, look, as long as you've got
a life that's got valuable

00:17:49.808 --> 00:17:52.740
contents, the more,
the better.

00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:56.339
You might say here's common
ground between the two

00:17:56.339 --> 00:17:58.910
strategies--the more,
the better.

00:17:58.910 --> 00:18:02.085
Now previously,
we've--I've argued that

00:18:02.085 --> 00:18:06.180
immortality would not actually
be a good thing.

00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:10.086
Eventually rich and incredible
as the world is,

00:18:10.086 --> 00:18:15.011
eventually, the goods of life
would run out and immortality

00:18:15.011 --> 00:18:18.602
would be dreadful.
But having said that,

00:18:18.602 --> 00:18:23.114
that's not to suggest that
we--most of us--come remotely

00:18:23.114 --> 00:18:26.517
close to that condition.
For most of us,

00:18:26.517 --> 00:18:31.424
it's certainly true that dying
at 30 deprives you of goods that

00:18:31.424 --> 00:18:35.619
would have come to you,
if only you'd lived to 40.

00:18:35.619 --> 00:18:39.710
And dying at 40 deprives you of
goods that would have come to

00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:42.710
you if only you'd lived to 50 or
60 or 80.

00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:45.656
So, one thing that we're
inclined to agree is,

00:18:45.656 --> 00:18:48.667
other things being equal,
the longer your life,

00:18:48.667 --> 00:18:55.140
the better.
So here's a life, 50 years long.

00:18:58.650 --> 00:19:03.657
And suppose you live it with a
certain amount of value in your

00:19:03.657 --> 00:19:06.982
life, 100 value points,
whatever that is,

00:19:06.982 --> 00:19:11.396
whatever the--however our units
of measuring just how good a

00:19:11.396 --> 00:19:13.483
life is.
We'd say, look,

00:19:13.483 --> 00:19:18.535
better to have a life at that
value, instead of going through

00:19:18.535 --> 00:19:22.000
50 years, went for 100 years.
Fair enough.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.308
We might say,
we all agree,

00:19:24.308 --> 00:19:28.660
don't we, that quantity of
life's a good thing.

00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:33.178
And that does seem plausible.
But at the same time we'll want

00:19:33.178 --> 00:19:35.683
to immediately say quantity of
life may matter,

00:19:35.683 --> 00:19:38.080
but it's not the only thing
that matters.

00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:45.058
Quality of life matters as well.
And again, that point's fairly

00:19:45.058 --> 00:19:51.141
uncontroversial.
If you had to choose between

00:19:51.141 --> 00:19:59.119
your life of 50 years at 100
value points or 50 years at

00:19:59.119 --> 00:20:04.059
whatever that is,
130 value points,

00:20:04.059 --> 00:20:08.259
you'd rather have the second
life.

00:20:08.259 --> 00:20:12.250
The length of life isn't the
only thing we care about.

00:20:12.250 --> 00:20:15.789
The overall quality of your
life is something we care about

00:20:15.789 --> 00:20:17.295
as well.
And this, of course,

00:20:17.295 --> 00:20:19.670
is another topic that we've
talked about previously.

00:20:19.670 --> 00:20:23.909
Just what is it that goes into
making a life better than

00:20:23.909 --> 00:20:25.736
another?
So, we now see,

00:20:25.736 --> 00:20:28.765
summing it up,
yeah, got to pay attention to

00:20:28.765 --> 00:20:32.779
quality, got to pay attention to
quantity or duration.

00:20:32.779 --> 00:20:35.951
Of course, the reason I just
corrected myself is because you

00:20:35.951 --> 00:20:39.069
might say, if you want to think
about it mathematically,

00:20:39.069 --> 00:20:42.410
it all is just a matter of
quantity.

00:20:42.410 --> 00:20:46.952
As long as when we measure
quantity, we bear in mind we

00:20:46.952 --> 00:20:50.906
need to measure not just the
length of the life,

00:20:50.906 --> 00:20:56.473
but the height of the box.
So, the area of the box here is

00:20:56.473 --> 00:20:59.909
50 x 100 units,
so whatever that is,

00:20:59.909 --> 00:21:01.480
that's 5,000.

00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:06.640
I'm going to get another giggle
here, right.

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:09.290
Imagine our little units.
It's a quality,

00:21:09.290 --> 00:21:13.829
one unit of quantity--one unit
of quality for a year.

00:21:13.829 --> 00:21:18.586
So, it's a quality year unit,
whatever it is,

00:21:18.586 --> 00:21:24.820
5,000 units.
Here 6,500.

00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:31.089
You might say,
look, we can capture the

00:21:31.089 --> 00:21:34.480
thought that the duration of
your life matters,

00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:38.013
the quality of your life
matters, by multiplying the two

00:21:38.013 --> 00:21:40.383
together.
And without getting hung up on

00:21:40.383 --> 00:21:43.656
the numbers, as though there was
any kind of precision here,

00:21:43.656 --> 00:21:45.930
the underlying thought's fairly
clear.

00:21:45.930 --> 00:21:51.242
The area of the box represents
the overall quality--the overall

00:21:51.242 --> 00:21:56.213
quantity that you managed to
cram into your life in your 50

00:21:56.213 --> 00:21:58.381
years.
And we could start measuring

00:21:58.381 --> 00:22:01.910
different kinds of lives.
We might start worrying about

00:22:01.910 --> 00:22:07.170
well, look, suppose I could live
50 years at 130 or I could live,

00:22:07.170 --> 00:22:09.619
whatever it is,
100 years at some other number

00:22:09.619 --> 00:22:12.171
that's a little bit less.
We might say,

00:22:12.171 --> 00:22:15.249
oh, less quality,
but longer quantity,

00:22:15.249 --> 00:22:18.909
longer duration,
more valuable life filled in

00:22:18.909 --> 00:22:24.029
that last box.
We see how it goes.

00:22:24.029 --> 00:22:28.491
But the question we need to ask
is--so, if we've got this more

00:22:28.491 --> 00:22:32.134
rich sense of quantity,
where we multiply the duration

00:22:32.134 --> 00:22:35.945
of the life times the how good a
life you're having while you've

00:22:35.945 --> 00:22:39.690
got it,
does that give adequate place

00:22:39.690 --> 00:22:44.798
to what we think is valuable?
Does that give adequate place

00:22:44.798 --> 00:22:46.080
to quality in life?

00:22:49.319 --> 00:22:53.028
Let me draw some different
boxes, some different possible

00:22:53.028 --> 00:22:54.750
lives to choose between.

00:23:13.170 --> 00:23:17.580
Suppose you had a nice long
life, 150 years.

00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:28.811
Again, just for the sake of
concreteness,

00:23:28.811 --> 00:23:35.960
we assign 50 quality points.
So, the area is 7,500.

00:23:39.519 --> 00:23:44.170
Let's suppose,
so you can get a feel for this,

00:23:44.170 --> 00:23:50.059
let's suppose that the best
life lived on earth so far was

00:23:50.059 --> 00:23:54.681
worth a 10.
So this is an incredible life,

00:23:54.681 --> 00:23:59.250
to be a 50.
And you get it for 150 years.

00:23:59.250 --> 00:24:00.420
A very nice life.

00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:07.550
Now, compare it with this life.

00:24:12.559 --> 00:24:16.884
Suppose that this life isn't
really all that good in terms of

00:24:16.884 --> 00:24:19.840
how well off you are at any
given time.

00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:25.081
It's plus one.
Zero would be a life not worth

00:24:25.081 --> 00:24:27.849
having, though no worse than
nonexistence.

00:24:27.849 --> 00:24:30.608
Negative numbers would be lives
presumably that would be you're

00:24:30.608 --> 00:24:35.467
better off dead.
This life is just barely worth

00:24:35.467 --> 00:24:38.700
having.
It's plus one.

00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:41.636
But it's a very,
very, very long life,

00:24:41.636 --> 00:24:45.049
so long that I couldn't draw it
to scale.

00:24:45.049 --> 00:24:49.069
That's why we've got the "..."
in the middle.

00:24:49.069 --> 00:24:56.289
Suppose it goes on for 30,000
years.

00:24:56.289 --> 00:24:57.660
Well, the math here is pretty
easy.

00:24:57.660 --> 00:25:03.830
30,000 times one is 30,000 in
terms of the area.

00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:09.148
Okay.
So, trying to choose between

00:25:09.148 --> 00:25:15.040
these two lives.
Life A or Life B?

00:25:18.990 --> 00:25:21.576
In terms of quantity,
our enriched notion of

00:25:21.576 --> 00:25:25.126
quantity, where you measure the
length of the life times the

00:25:25.126 --> 00:25:31.298
height of the box,
Life B's got more quantity of

00:25:31.298 --> 00:25:37.150
what matters--30,000 versus
7,500.

00:25:37.150 --> 00:25:43.286
And yet, most of us,
when we think about this

00:25:43.286 --> 00:25:49.980
choice, do not find B to be a
preferable life,

00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:54.457
even though the quantity
of value--Just suppose we could

00:25:54.457 --> 00:25:59.079
measure quantity of whatever the
goods are that we've got crammed

00:25:59.079 --> 00:26:01.544
into our life.
Well, this has very,

00:26:01.544 --> 00:26:04.920
very, very small amounts
stretched over a very long time.

00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:11.319
The quantity's larger,
but Life A seems preferable.

00:26:11.319 --> 00:26:15.461
Now, for any--at least,
this may not be true for

00:26:15.461 --> 00:26:20.130
everybody, but for those of us
who share that thought,

00:26:20.130 --> 00:26:24.359
you might say quantity isn't
all it's about.

00:26:24.359 --> 00:26:28.556
Or when we try to take quality
into account,

00:26:28.556 --> 00:26:33.240
it wasn't so much that we
couldn't measure it,

00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:39.796
it's that if you reduce the
importance of quality into,

00:26:39.796 --> 00:26:44.595
fold it into quantity,
so that what it's all about is

00:26:44.595 --> 00:26:48.367
the total amount that you're
getting, well the total amount's

00:26:48.367 --> 00:26:52.332
bigger in B than A.
If you don't think B's a better

00:26:52.332 --> 00:26:57.329
life, that suggests that totals
aren't what it's all about.

00:26:57.329 --> 00:27:01.644
Well, what else might we then
choose between with regard to A

00:27:01.644 --> 00:27:05.348
and B?
Well, the natural response is

00:27:05.348 --> 00:27:11.606
to say, even though Life A is
shorter, it attains a kind of

00:27:11.606 --> 00:27:15.854
peak,
a kind of height that isn't

00:27:15.854 --> 00:27:20.696
approached anyplace in Life B.
And perhaps,

00:27:20.696 --> 00:27:25.320
then, in evaluating lives and
choosing between rival lives,

00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:28.749
we can't just look for the
quantity of good,

00:27:28.749 --> 00:27:33.410
we have to look at the peaks.
We have to look at the heights.

00:27:33.410 --> 00:27:37.679
In choosing between lives,
it's important to think not

00:27:37.679 --> 00:27:40.740
just about how much did you pack
in,

00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:47.134
total, but what were the
greatest goods that you had or

00:27:47.134 --> 00:27:51.457
accomplished in your life?
And perhaps,

00:27:51.457 --> 00:27:55.990
then, we should conclude,
quality can trump quantity.

00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:07.952
Perhaps with the right quality
in place, quantity becomes of

00:28:07.952 --> 00:28:12.857
secondary importance.
Yeah, it might be that if we

00:28:12.857 --> 00:28:16.660
could have a longer life where
we achieved great things,

00:28:16.660 --> 00:28:19.319
rather than a shorter life
where we achieved great things,

00:28:19.319 --> 00:28:23.335
better to have the longer life.
Quantity might matter,

00:28:23.335 --> 00:28:30.309
too, as long as we think the
quality's what matters the most.

00:28:30.309 --> 00:28:35.278
But a more radical version of
the theory would say,

00:28:35.278 --> 00:28:39.850
actually, quality's all
that matters.

00:28:39.850 --> 00:28:45.190
The peaks are all that matter.
That, at any rate,

00:28:45.190 --> 00:28:51.423
is the position that gets
expressed by Hölderlin in the

00:28:51.423 --> 00:28:55.730
poem "To the Parcae," to the
fates.

00:28:55.730 --> 00:28:57.240
That was in one of the essays
that I had you read.

00:28:57.240 --> 00:29:00.880
But let me read that now.
"To the Parcae."

00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:04.588
A single summer grant me,
great powers,

00:29:04.588 --> 00:29:06.884
and
a single autumn for fully

00:29:06.884 --> 00:29:09.543
ripened song
that, sated with the sweetness

00:29:09.543 --> 00:29:13.006
of my
playing, my heart may more

00:29:13.006 --> 00:29:15.737
willingly die.
The soul that,

00:29:15.737 --> 00:29:17.990
living, did not attain its
divine

00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:21.819
right cannot repose in the
nether world.

00:29:21.819 --> 00:29:24.360
But once what I am bent on,
what is

00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:28.376
holy, my poetry is accomplished:
Be welcome then,

00:29:28.376 --> 00:29:30.720
stillness of the shadows'
world!

00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:33.700
I shall be satisfied though my
lyre will not

00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:36.579
accompany me down there.
Once I

00:29:36.579 --> 00:29:39.825
lived like the gods,
and more is not needed

00:29:39.825 --> 00:29:44.259
[Kaufmann 1976].
Hölderlin is saying he doesn't

00:29:44.259 --> 00:29:48.670
care about quantity at all.
If he can accomplish something

00:29:48.670 --> 00:29:52.831
great, if he can ascend to the
heights and do something great

00:29:52.831 --> 00:29:55.190
with his poetry,
that's enough.

00:29:55.190 --> 00:29:59.330
Once he's lived like the gods,
more is not needed.

00:30:02.359 --> 00:30:06.479
So, in thinking about what we
want to do with our lives,

00:30:06.479 --> 00:30:10.823
it's not enough to have the
kind of theory that we've begun

00:30:10.823 --> 00:30:15.433
to sketch in previous weeks,
where we think about what are

00:30:15.433 --> 00:30:19.860
the various things worth having
in a life?--we also have to

00:30:19.860 --> 00:30:23.829
address this question of quality
versus quantity.

00:30:23.829 --> 00:30:29.578
Is quality only important
insofar as it gets folded into

00:30:29.578 --> 00:30:34.955
producing greater quantity?
Or does quality matter in its

00:30:34.955 --> 00:30:38.594
own right as something that's
worth going for,

00:30:38.594 --> 00:30:41.910
even when it means a smaller
quantity?

00:30:41.910 --> 00:30:45.990
And if quality does matter,
does quantity matter as well?

00:30:45.990 --> 00:30:49.640
Or is, indeed,
quality all that matters?

00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:53.512
Is Hölderlin right when he
says once I've lived like the

00:30:53.512 --> 00:30:55.380
gods, more is not needed?

00:31:00.059 --> 00:31:04.864
Now, Hölderlin,
I imagine, in thinking about

00:31:04.864 --> 00:31:10.761
why that kind of life is the
best kind of life he could

00:31:10.761 --> 00:31:13.638
aspire to,
is thinking,

00:31:13.638 --> 00:31:19.708
in part, about the lasting
contribution that his poetry

00:31:19.708 --> 00:31:22.924
makes.
There's a sense in which,

00:31:22.924 --> 00:31:27.157
when we think about having done
things like that,

00:31:27.157 --> 00:31:31.390
we feel that we attain a kind
of immortality.

00:31:31.390 --> 00:31:38.193
We live on through our works.
And so the next question I want

00:31:38.193 --> 00:31:42.825
to turn to in thinking about
strategies of how to live in

00:31:42.825 --> 00:31:47.023
light of the fact of,
in terms of facing our

00:31:47.023 --> 00:31:50.443
mortality is,
well, maybe a kind of

00:31:50.443 --> 00:31:54.769
immortality is worth
going after.

00:31:54.769 --> 00:31:58.783
Or maybe, at the very least,
we can take a kind of comfort

00:31:58.783 --> 00:32:03.220
in thinking that we have or can
attain a kind of immortality.

00:32:03.220 --> 00:32:07.516
I emphasize the word "kind," of
course, because strictly

00:32:07.516 --> 00:32:12.360
speaking, if you live on through
your works, it's not as though

00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:17.633
you are literally living on.
It's semi-immortality or

00:32:17.633 --> 00:32:21.473
quasi-immortality.
I suppose people who don't

00:32:21.473 --> 00:32:25.140
believe in it would prefer to
call it pseudo-immortality.

00:32:25.140 --> 00:32:27.730
Actually, this reminds me of a
joke.

00:32:27.730 --> 00:32:33.293
Here's a Woody Allen joke.
"I don't want to be immortal

00:32:33.293 --> 00:32:37.807
through my work;
I want to be immortal through

00:32:37.807 --> 00:32:40.830
not dying."
Well, as you know,

00:32:40.830 --> 00:32:45.008
previously I've argued that
genuine immortality,

00:32:45.008 --> 00:32:48.920
unending life,
would not be a good thing.

00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:55.740
But still, many of us aspire to
this kind of semi-immortality.

00:32:55.740 --> 00:32:57.722
And actually,
it can take,

00:32:57.722 --> 00:33:00.339
I think again,
two broad forms.

00:33:00.339 --> 00:33:04.204
Sometimes people want to say
there's a sense in which,

00:33:04.204 --> 00:33:08.359
although it's not as though
you're literally living on,

00:33:08.359 --> 00:33:14.942
there's something like that
going on, insofar as a part of

00:33:14.942 --> 00:33:18.539
you continues.
If I have children,

00:33:18.539 --> 00:33:24.064
then literally some of my--in
my case, there's a male--one of

00:33:24.064 --> 00:33:28.139
my cells continues.
And then their cells continue

00:33:28.139 --> 00:33:31.672
in their children and their
cells continue in their

00:33:31.672 --> 00:33:33.614
children.
If you think of an amoeba

00:33:33.614 --> 00:33:35.846
splitting and splitting,
and splitting and splitting

00:33:35.846 --> 00:33:38.275
again,
part of the original amoeba

00:33:38.275 --> 00:33:41.970
could be there for many,
many, many generations.

00:33:41.970 --> 00:33:46.018
Some people take comfort in the
thought that,

00:33:46.018 --> 00:33:50.710
literally speaking,
a part of them will continue,

00:33:50.710 --> 00:33:55.485
if not through cells through my
offspring, perhaps at least my

00:33:55.485 --> 00:33:58.789
atoms get recycled,
get used again.

00:33:58.789 --> 00:34:03.569
And so I get absorbed into the
universe, but I never disappear.

00:34:03.569 --> 00:34:07.289
Some people take comfort in
that thought.

00:34:07.289 --> 00:34:11.514
The German philosopher
Schopenhauer thought that this

00:34:11.514 --> 00:34:15.090
should reduce somewhat the sting
of death.

00:34:15.090 --> 00:34:19.875
He said, "But it will be asked,
‘How is the permanence of

00:34:19.875 --> 00:34:24.661
mere dust, of crude matter,
to be regarded as a continuance

00:34:24.661 --> 00:34:28.010
of our true inner nature?'"
And he answers, 

00:34:28.010 --> 00:34:30.650
Oh!
Do you know this dust then?

00:34:30.650 --> 00:34:33.110
Do you know what it is and what
it can do?

00:34:33.110 --> 00:34:36.909
Learn to know it before you
despise it.

00:34:36.909 --> 00:34:39.840
This matter,
now lying there as dust and

00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:43.748
ashes, will soon form into
crystals when dissolved in

00:34:43.748 --> 00:34:45.969
water.
It will shine as metal;

00:34:45.969 --> 00:34:49.181
it will then emit electric
sparks… It will,

00:34:49.181 --> 00:34:52.977
indeed, of its own accord,
form itself into plant and

00:34:52.977 --> 00:34:56.509
animal;
and from its mysterious womb it

00:34:56.509 --> 00:35:01.176
will develop that life,
about the loss of which you in

00:35:01.176 --> 00:35:06.460
your narrowness of mind are so
nervous and anxious.

00:35:06.460 --> 00:35:09.473
Well, that's a very moving
passage, but I have to say,

00:35:09.473 --> 00:35:13.200
I don't buy it.
I don't find any comfort at all

00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:18.188
in the thought that my atoms
will still be around getting

00:35:18.188 --> 00:35:22.783
reused into something else.
So, this first kind of

00:35:22.783 --> 00:35:26.804
semi-immortality,
where you take comfort in the

00:35:26.804 --> 00:35:32.750
thought that literally there are
parts of you that will continue,

00:35:32.750 --> 00:35:36.462
this strikes me as a kind of
desperate striving,

00:35:36.462 --> 00:35:40.843
desperate reaching for straws.
Perhaps in Schopenhauer's case,

00:35:40.843 --> 00:35:43.414
leading him to delude himself
into thinking,

00:35:43.414 --> 00:35:46.882
"Oh, it's not so bad that I'm
going to die and going to die

00:35:46.882 --> 00:35:49.123
soon.
At least my atoms will still be

00:35:49.123 --> 00:35:52.559
around."
It doesn't work for me.

00:35:52.559 --> 00:35:54.970
There's a second sort of
approach, though,

00:35:54.970 --> 00:35:58.379
where it's not so much that
you're supposed to be comforted

00:35:58.379 --> 00:36:01.495
by the thought that your
parts will continue to

00:36:01.495 --> 00:36:04.331
last after you,
but that your

00:36:04.331 --> 00:36:11.230
accomplishments will
continue to last after you.

00:36:11.230 --> 00:36:16.790
Hölderlin writes poetry,
which we're still reading some

00:36:16.790 --> 00:36:21.404
200 years later.
You can write a novel which can

00:36:21.404 --> 00:36:25.280
be read for 20 or 50 or 100 or
more years.

00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:29.168
You might make some
contribution to math or

00:36:29.168 --> 00:36:33.889
philosophy or science,
and 50 or 100 years later,

00:36:33.889 --> 00:36:37.951
people could still be talking
about that philosophical

00:36:37.951 --> 00:36:40.940
argument or that mathematical
result.

00:36:40.940 --> 00:36:42.570
You might have other kinds of
accomplishments.

00:36:42.570 --> 00:36:50.559
You might build a building that
will last after you.

00:36:50.559 --> 00:36:53.521
Stone cutters,
I've read interviews with stone

00:36:53.521 --> 00:36:57.667
cutters who take a kind of pride
and comfort in the thought that

00:36:57.667 --> 00:37:02.041
long after they're gone,
the buildings that they helped

00:37:02.041 --> 00:37:06.383
build will still be there.
You might try to build a

00:37:06.383 --> 00:37:09.650
company that will last after you
die.

00:37:09.650 --> 00:37:12.998
Or, for that matter,
you might take pleasure and

00:37:12.998 --> 00:37:17.130
comfort in the accomplishment of
having raised a family.

00:37:17.130 --> 00:37:21.601
Here, not so much the thought
that some of your cells are in

00:37:21.601 --> 00:37:25.503
your offspring,
but rather the thought that to

00:37:25.503 --> 00:37:30.121
have raised another decent human
being is a nontrivial

00:37:30.121 --> 00:37:33.372
accomplishment,
something worth having done

00:37:33.372 --> 00:37:36.373
with your life.
And that accomplishment

00:37:36.373 --> 00:37:41.434
continues after you're gone.
Well, what should we think

00:37:41.434 --> 00:37:46.210
about this second group of
approaches to attaining

00:37:46.210 --> 00:37:50.514
semi-immortality?
I've got to say that I'm of two

00:37:50.514 --> 00:37:55.789
minds when I think about them.
Unlike the dust and the atoms

00:37:55.789 --> 00:38:00.823
stuff, where I just think you're
deluding yourself,

00:38:00.823 --> 00:38:06.260
I find myself drawn to this
second set of thoughts.

00:38:06.260 --> 00:38:12.417
I find myself tempted by the
thought that there's something

00:38:12.417 --> 00:38:18.468
worth doing about producing
something that continues for a

00:38:18.468 --> 00:38:21.320
while.
That it's significant.

00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:25.723
And even if my life here on
earth is a short one,

00:38:25.723 --> 00:38:29.852
if something that I've
accomplished continues,

00:38:29.852 --> 00:38:35.830
my life is the better for it.
That's Hölderlin's thought,

00:38:35.830 --> 00:38:41.781
I suppose.
And it's a view that appeals to

00:38:41.781 --> 00:38:44.027
me.
I suppose it explains,

00:38:44.027 --> 00:38:47.650
in part, why I write
philosophy, in the hopes that

00:38:47.650 --> 00:38:52.309
the things I write might still
be read 20 years after I die,

00:38:52.309 --> 00:38:55.291
or 50 years or,
if I'm so lucky,

00:38:55.291 --> 00:38:59.326
100 years after I die.
Well, in certain moods,

00:38:59.326 --> 00:39:03.079
perhaps in most moods,
I'm drawn by that thought.

00:39:03.079 --> 00:39:06.052
But in other moods,
I've got to confess,

00:39:06.052 --> 00:39:09.698
I'm skeptical of it.
I remind myself of Schopenhauer

00:39:09.698 --> 00:39:13.000
writing his little passage,
his Ode To Dust,

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:16.567
and I find myself saying,
just like Schopenhauer was so

00:39:16.567 --> 00:39:19.869
desperate that he deludes
himself into thinking,

00:39:19.869 --> 00:39:21.730
"Oh, it doesn't matter that I'm
about to turn into dust.

00:39:21.730 --> 00:39:25.319
Dust is really,
really important," I'm just

00:39:25.319 --> 00:39:29.934
deluding myself as well,
when I think there's something

00:39:29.934 --> 00:39:32.508
grander,
something significant,

00:39:32.508 --> 00:39:36.449
something valuable about having
made an accomplishment,

00:39:36.449 --> 00:39:39.840
having achieved something that
continues beyond me.

00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:43.402
So in certain moods,
at least, I find myself

00:39:43.402 --> 00:39:46.800
thinking that I've just deluded
myself.

00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:52.141
But that's only certain moods.
And at least most of the time,

00:39:52.141 --> 00:39:55.619
I find myself in agreement with
Hölderlin.

00:39:55.619 --> 00:40:01.469
Not necessarily in thinking
quantity doesn't matter at all.

00:40:01.469 --> 00:40:05.523
To have written one great work
is all you need and more great

00:40:05.523 --> 00:40:09.780
works doesn't add anything--that
strikes me as going too far.

00:40:09.780 --> 00:40:14.668
But at least to have done
something significant that

00:40:14.668 --> 00:40:19.556
abides, that does seem to me to
add to the value and

00:40:19.556 --> 00:40:24.922
significance of my life.
Well, let me mention an entire

00:40:24.922 --> 00:40:28.083
different approach.
I'm going to give very,

00:40:28.083 --> 00:40:31.487
very short shrift to this last
approach, but it's probably

00:40:31.487 --> 00:40:36.631
worth mentioning as well.
The entire assumption of all

00:40:36.631 --> 00:40:43.821
the lines of thought that I've
been discussing so far today

00:40:43.821 --> 00:40:51.383
have in common the underlying
belief that the way to deal with

00:40:51.383 --> 00:40:59.069
the fact that we live and then
we're dead is to try to make the

00:40:59.069 --> 00:41:05.019
life that you've got as good as
possible,

00:41:05.019 --> 00:41:08.847
as valuable as possible,
to pack as much into it as you

00:41:08.847 --> 00:41:12.957
can, even though there's room
for disagreement about what's

00:41:12.957 --> 00:41:15.579
the best strategy for doing
that.

00:41:15.579 --> 00:41:23.964
The picture is one in which we
say we can't do anything about

00:41:23.964 --> 00:41:29.254
the loss of life,
so the right response is to

00:41:29.254 --> 00:41:34.619
make the life that we've got as
valuable as it can be,

00:41:34.619 --> 00:41:40.309
to see it as valuable as it can
be.

00:41:40.309 --> 00:41:43.150
But there's a rather different
approach.

00:41:43.150 --> 00:41:50.832
That alternative approach says,
yes, we're going to lose life

00:41:50.832 --> 00:41:57.015
and that's horrible.
But it's only horrible insofar

00:41:57.015 --> 00:42:03.409
as you think of life as
something that it's bad to lose.

00:42:03.409 --> 00:42:07.664
After all, if we were to decide
that life wasn't really a

00:42:07.664 --> 00:42:10.930
valuable gift,
if it wasn't really something

00:42:10.930 --> 00:42:14.622
worth embracing,
and something that we could

00:42:14.622 --> 00:42:19.129
turn into something full of
value, then its loss wouldn't

00:42:19.129 --> 00:42:21.956
actually be a loss.
That's a point we've seen

00:42:21.956 --> 00:42:24.432
before, right?
The central badness of death is

00:42:24.432 --> 00:42:26.690
explained in the depravation
account.

00:42:26.690 --> 00:42:30.594
You are deprived of the fact
that you could have had more

00:42:30.594 --> 00:42:34.010
life that would have been worth
having overall.

00:42:34.010 --> 00:42:40.659
But if life isn't worth having
overall, then its loss is not a

00:42:40.659 --> 00:42:45.380
bad thing, but a good thing.
The trick, then,

00:42:45.380 --> 00:42:49.461
isn't to make life as valuable
as it could be,

00:42:49.461 --> 00:42:53.723
but rather to come to recognize
that on balance,

00:42:53.723 --> 00:42:57.260
life isn't positive,
but negative.

00:42:57.260 --> 00:43:00.976
I know that what I'm about to
say has a kind of Classics

00:43:00.976 --> 00:43:03.219
Illustrated simplicity to
it,

00:43:03.219 --> 00:43:06.027
and it's a bit of an
over-exaggeration,

00:43:06.027 --> 00:43:09.648
but in gross terms,
we might say the first general

00:43:09.648 --> 00:43:14.155
outlook--that life is good and
so the loss of it is bad and so

00:43:14.155 --> 00:43:18.367
the answer is make as much of it
as we can while we've got

00:43:18.367 --> 00:43:23.398
it--you might say that is,
in broad strokes,

00:43:23.398 --> 00:43:28.655
the western outlook.
And in broad strokes,

00:43:28.655 --> 00:43:34.477
the notion that life isn't
really as good as we take it to

00:43:34.477 --> 00:43:35.977
be,
but is, in fact,

00:43:35.977 --> 00:43:38.363
bad overall,
perhaps it's oversimplification

00:43:38.363 --> 00:43:41.906
to call it the eastern outlook,
but at least it's an outlook

00:43:41.906 --> 00:43:45.042
that gets more expression
typically in eastern thought

00:43:45.042 --> 00:43:49.962
than in western thought.
Foremost example of this second

00:43:49.962 --> 00:43:53.500
outlook is, I suppose,
Buddhism.

00:43:53.500 --> 00:43:58.786
Four noble truths in Buddhism.
The first noble truth is that

00:43:58.786 --> 00:44:05.086
life is suffering.
Buddhists believe if you think

00:44:05.086 --> 00:44:12.508
hard about the underlying nature
of life, you'll see that

00:44:12.508 --> 00:44:17.710
everyplace there is loss.
There is suffering.

00:44:17.710 --> 00:44:21.050
There is disease.
There is death.

00:44:21.050 --> 00:44:26.104
There is pain.
Sure, there are things that we

00:44:26.104 --> 00:44:29.360
want and, if we're lucky,
we get them.

00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:34.962
But then we lose them and that
just adds to the suffering and

00:44:34.962 --> 00:44:41.750
the pain and the misery.
On balance, life isn't good.

00:44:41.750 --> 00:44:46.099
First noble truth,
life is suffering.

00:44:46.099 --> 00:44:51.414
And so, armed with this
estimation, what Buddhists try

00:44:51.414 --> 00:44:56.829
to do is to free you from
attachment to these goods,

00:44:56.829 --> 00:45:03.099
so that when you lose them,
the loss is minimized.

00:45:03.099 --> 00:45:07.730
And indeed, Buddhists try to
free you from what they take to

00:45:07.730 --> 00:45:10.870
be the illusion of there being a
self.

00:45:10.870 --> 00:45:17.746
There is no me to lose anything.
Death is terrifying insofar as

00:45:17.746 --> 00:45:21.739
I worry about it being the
dissolution of myself.

00:45:21.739 --> 00:45:27.989
If there is no self,
there's nothing to dissolve.

00:45:27.989 --> 00:45:34.500
It all makes sense--and I have
tremendous respect for

00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:41.887
Buddhism--it all makes sense,
given the thought that life is

00:45:41.887 --> 00:45:46.054
suffering.
But for better or for worse,

00:45:46.054 --> 00:45:50.382
I'm a child of the west.
I'm a child of the Book of

00:45:50.382 --> 00:45:54.226
Genesis, where God looks on the
world and says,

00:45:54.226 --> 00:45:57.120
"It's good."
For me, at least,

00:45:57.120 --> 00:46:02.619
the strategy of minimize your
loss by viewing the world as

00:46:02.619 --> 00:46:07.540
negative, is not one that I can
be at rest with.

00:46:07.540 --> 00:46:13.322
For me, life can be good.
And so the choices for me,

00:46:13.322 --> 00:46:18.367
and I suppose for most of us,
remain among the strategies

00:46:18.367 --> 00:46:24.076
with which I began.
How is it that we can most make

00:46:24.076 --> 00:46:29.010
our lives valuable?
What is it that we can do that

00:46:29.010 --> 00:46:31.541
will allow us,
with Hölderlin,

00:46:31.541 --> 00:46:35.000
to say, "once we lived like the
gods"?

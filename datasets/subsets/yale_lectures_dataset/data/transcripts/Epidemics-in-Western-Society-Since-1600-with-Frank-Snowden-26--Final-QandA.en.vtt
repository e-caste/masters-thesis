00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:03.330
Prof: Good morning.
 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.340
We'll get started.
 

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.090
As you know,
this isn't--there isn't going

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:10.640
to be a lecture this morning at
all.

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.969
We're going instead to have a
review session,

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:17.752
in which I'll be very much
dependent on your having

00:00:17.752 --> 00:00:21.460
questions, and our having a
joint discussion.

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.690
So, what I'm expecting to be
able to do is to,

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:29.640
when you have questions,
or want to contribute to--

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.024
I've got some questions as
well--we can put our heads

00:00:33.024 --> 00:00:33.740
together.
 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:38.037
And there'll be a microphone,
I hope, that we can pass

00:00:38.037 --> 00:00:41.200
around, and everyone will be
audible.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.295
The first thing I should say is
just to talk,

00:00:44.295 --> 00:00:47.320
just for a minute,
about the exam itself;

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.420
because I've now written it.
 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.250
So, at least we can say on that
much I'm the world's authority.

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.100
The exam will look like this.
 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.520
There will be two parts.
 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.450
The first part will be the ID
section,

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:07.528
and that will have--let's see,
you've got the list of

00:01:07.528 --> 00:01:11.582
identifications,
and I've literally just chosen

00:01:11.582 --> 00:01:15.406
ten of them,
and that will constitute two

00:01:15.406 --> 00:01:20.135
points each,
or a total of twenty points for

00:01:20.135 --> 00:01:21.900
the ID section.
 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.367
And, so, you can work out how
to budget your time,

00:01:25.367 --> 00:01:26.569
in that regard.
 

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:29.580
Clearly, you're not meant to
write an essay;

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.250
just even bullet points or a
short paragraph is all that's

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.019
expected with regard to the
identifications.

00:01:38.019 --> 00:01:42.688
The second part of the exam
consists of three essays,

00:01:42.688 --> 00:01:46.818
and I'm--that is,
three on a list of three--and

00:01:46.818 --> 00:01:50.500
I'll ask you to write on two of
them.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.028
And each of the essays
therefore will count forty

00:01:54.028 --> 00:01:54.690
points.
 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.489
So, part two of the exam will
count eighty points altogether.

00:01:59.489 --> 00:02:02.540
That tells how you should
budget your time.

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.900
The essay questions are much
more important than the

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.438
identifications.
 

00:02:08.438 --> 00:02:11.490
That's really the structure of
the exam.

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:14.828
I can't think really of
anything else that I can say

00:02:14.828 --> 00:02:15.680
about that.
 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.770
But let me see if
anyone--before we turn to

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.554
substantive issues,
does anyone have any questions

00:02:22.554 --> 00:02:26.810
about the format of the exam or
what's likely to be on it?

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.060
I can repeat what I've said
before.

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.615
The exam period itself is
notionally three hours,

00:02:33.615 --> 00:02:38.645
though you also get an
additional half-hour as a grace

00:02:38.645 --> 00:02:39.690
period.
 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.917
That, I understand,
is the Yale system,

00:02:42.917 --> 00:02:45.210
and we'll adhere to that.
 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:49.090
The exam will also--I wanted to
stress this--

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.620
it will cover the whole of the
course,

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.852
from the beginning,
and it won't simply be on the

00:02:55.852 --> 00:03:00.628
last part of the course,
since the mid-term.

00:03:00.628 --> 00:03:05.263
It will cover everything that
we've dealt with since January

00:03:05.263 --> 00:03:06.520
down to today.
 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.758
So, are there any questions
before we turn to the substance,

00:03:09.758 --> 00:03:14.413
about the format of the exam,
or what you could expect or not

00:03:14.413 --> 00:03:19.470
expect,
or anything of that nature?

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:20.610
Yes?
 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.906
Student:  Do we need to
bring in any sort of readings on

00:03:23.906 --> 00:03:24.810
the ID section?
 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.242
Prof: The question was,
do you need to bring in

00:03:29.242 --> 00:03:31.669
readings on the ID section?
 

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:35.500
I think that depends entirely
on which ID you deal with.

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:41.786
Some of the IDs are directly
based on the reading that you've

00:03:41.786 --> 00:03:42.520
done.
 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:47.110
So, for example,
if I ask Daniel Defoe,

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.431
to identify,
it would be really odd if you

00:03:49.431 --> 00:03:52.660
didn't bring in the Journal
of the Plague Year,

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.569
and why it was important.
 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:55.758
Okay?
 

00:03:55.758 --> 00:03:59.013
But if I asked you about,
say, the Paris School of

00:03:59.013 --> 00:04:02.399
Medicine, that you didn't
actually have readings on,

00:04:02.399 --> 00:04:04.788
then it wouldn't be
necessarily.

00:04:04.788 --> 00:04:09.723
So, it really depends on the
nature of the particular ID in

00:04:09.723 --> 00:04:10.659
question.
 

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:13.349
Okay?
 

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:18.889
Anything else about the exam?
 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:20.069
Okay, thanks.
 

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:24.331
Then let's move on to the
substantive part of the review,

00:04:24.331 --> 00:04:28.899
and the issues that we've been
dealing with in the course.

00:04:28.899 --> 00:04:33.759
And I thought one way we might
start would be for me to ask you

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:37.617
a question;
which is what do you think I

00:04:37.617 --> 00:04:42.079
should sensibly ask you about on
the final?

00:04:42.079 --> 00:04:46.526
What would make good final exam
questions for you,

00:04:46.526 --> 00:04:50.519
based on the material that
you've covered?

00:04:50.519 --> 00:04:54.553
And then we could put our heads
together a little bit to think

00:04:54.553 --> 00:04:57.990
about what might be some
elements of the answers that

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:59.709
you'd provide in them.
 

00:04:59.709 --> 00:05:05.579
Does anyone have a question
that I ought to ask you?

00:05:05.579 --> 00:05:12.079
It's never too late;
I could change the questions I

00:05:12.079 --> 00:05:15.230
wrote yesterday.
 

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:21.160
You think I should ask you
nothing?

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:26.480
It's always a possibility, too.
 

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:30.266
Okay, well I've got some
thoughts, if you like,

00:05:30.266 --> 00:05:33.970
for things that we might want
to deal with.

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:38.696
One was this-- and I'm going to
ask and see if any of you would

00:05:38.696 --> 00:05:42.889
like to help me think through
this particular issue--

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:49.007
if we're dealing with the
impact of major epidemic

00:05:49.007 --> 00:05:54.036
diseases on society,
what would be--is it true to

00:05:54.036 --> 00:05:58.430
think that it's really the
overall mortality that provides

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:02.668
the major way in which we can
assess whether this was an

00:06:02.668 --> 00:06:05.290
important event or it wasn't?
 

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:10.149
Is that how we judge the
significance of the passage of

00:06:10.149 --> 00:06:13.569
an epidemic disease through
society?

00:06:13.569 --> 00:06:17.016
Do we--is the body count,
in other words,

00:06:17.016 --> 00:06:19.430
the most important factor?
 

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:20.879
Or is it something else?
 

00:06:20.879 --> 00:06:25.586
How do we--what factors
determine whether an epidemic

00:06:25.586 --> 00:06:31.290
disease really is a significant
historical event or it isn't?

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:37.290
Do you have any thoughts on
that particular issue?

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:43.649
Yes--please? Thank you.
 

00:06:43.649 --> 00:06:46.810
Student:  Morbidity.
 

00:06:46.810 --> 00:07:04.865
**
Prof: Okay,

00:07:04.865 --> 00:07:05.730
thanks very much.
 

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:08.060
Did everyone hear?
 

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:12.699
The candidate for an answer
would be that it's not just the

00:07:12.699 --> 00:07:15.538
mortality,
but we need to look at the

00:07:15.538 --> 00:07:18.396
morbidity,
and even more than that we need

00:07:18.396 --> 00:07:22.620
to look at the class,
or the profile of the victims

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:26.048
of the epidemic,
and that it makes a big

00:07:26.048 --> 00:07:30.889
difference whether the victims
of the disease are the elderly,

00:07:30.889 --> 00:07:33.605
and perhaps infants;
in other words,

00:07:33.605 --> 00:07:38.286
whether it seems like a normal
event in the life of that

00:07:38.286 --> 00:07:43.137
society, or whether it targets
instead a different patient

00:07:43.137 --> 00:07:44.500
population.
 

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:47.271
If it targets people in the
prime of life,

00:07:47.271 --> 00:07:50.180
it's experienced in a very
different way.

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:54.353
So, clearly the class profile
is important,

00:07:54.353 --> 00:07:59.519
and not just the mortality,
or even the morbidity.

00:07:59.519 --> 00:08:00.709
Are there other factors?
 

00:08:00.709 --> 00:08:02.399
Yes?
 

00:08:02.399 --> 00:08:05.725
Student:  One argument
in favor of mortality mattering

00:08:05.725 --> 00:08:08.829
is it didn't really have much of
an impact on things like

00:08:08.829 --> 00:08:10.720
society,
and it didn't prove lasting.

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:11.990
Like you could control things.
 

00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:15.365
So you'd have like a really big
morbidity but a small mortality,

00:08:15.365 --> 00:08:17.079
and so that prevented a panic.
 

00:08:17.079 --> 00:08:19.389
Prof: That's great.
 

00:08:19.389 --> 00:08:32.028
**
Prof: Maybe you could

00:08:32.028 --> 00:08:32.399
start again.
 

00:08:32.399 --> 00:08:38.590
I don't think everyone could
hear you.

00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:44.422
Student:  One argument
in favor of mortality mattering

00:08:44.422 --> 00:08:47.307
is that flu,
which didn't really have that

00:08:47.307 --> 00:08:49.178
much of a lasting impact on
society,

00:08:49.178 --> 00:08:52.980
had a really high morbidity but
a really small mortality,

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:56.696
and everyone knew that,
and so they weren't panicked

00:08:56.696 --> 00:08:57.789
when it came.
 

00:08:57.789 --> 00:08:58.538
Prof: Okay.
 

00:08:58.538 --> 00:09:03.110
There's the idea then that we
shouldn't retreat too much from

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:06.158
mortality, that it really does
matter.

00:09:06.158 --> 00:09:09.240
And I'm really happy that you
did something very important,

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:13.381
which was not just to leave
this matter hanging in the

00:09:13.381 --> 00:09:17.681
abstract,
but to tack it to a particular

00:09:17.681 --> 00:09:18.690
example.
 

00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:22.144
And, so, it's really important
that you bring in particular

00:09:22.144 --> 00:09:24.230
diseases to clinch your
argument.

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:27.784
Talking about influenza is
exactly the way that the

00:09:27.784 --> 00:09:31.413
argument ought to go,
and weighing that versus other

00:09:31.413 --> 00:09:33.759
diseases that were different.
 

00:09:33.759 --> 00:09:34.909
That's good.
 

00:09:34.909 --> 00:09:36.519
Thank you.
 

00:09:36.519 --> 00:09:37.679
Right, someone else?
 

00:09:37.679 --> 00:09:38.940
Oh, there we go.
 

00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:42.620
Student:  At the same
time, I think that what that

00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:45.908
really speaks to is more the
reaction of society to

00:09:45.908 --> 00:09:46.830
something.
 

00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:50.248
So, that it's important to say
that it's not just a number that

00:09:50.248 --> 00:09:52.461
matters;
that mortality rate isn't so

00:09:52.461 --> 00:09:56.144
much the important part as much
as how people were able to kind

00:09:56.144 --> 00:09:58.519
of incorporate that into their
lives.

00:09:58.519 --> 00:10:03.493
Because as you were saying,
flu wasn't necessarily the most

00:10:03.493 --> 00:10:05.980
striking example to people.
 

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:10.116
However, I think that
certain--even times like

00:10:10.116 --> 00:10:13.977
tuberculosis,
where you have people who are

00:10:13.977 --> 00:10:17.840
dying but in very much longer
periods.

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:21.894
So, you have more time for
reactions in literature and art,

00:10:21.894 --> 00:10:24.899
and those have just as much of
an impact.

00:10:24.899 --> 00:10:27.950
And, in fact,
they're really lasting impacts

00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:31.710
because we still have those
pieces of epidemic art and

00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:36.586
literature to look back on,
to see how they had impacts on

00:10:36.586 --> 00:10:37.370
society.
 

00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:39.009
Prof: Okay,
yes, thanks very much.

00:10:39.009 --> 00:10:43.298
So, it's--you want to
complicate the matter even

00:10:43.298 --> 00:10:46.433
more--
it really depends on how it's

00:10:46.433 --> 00:10:49.831
perceived,
perceptions-- and also that's

00:10:49.831 --> 00:10:53.308
reflected in the arts and in
literature,

00:10:53.308 --> 00:10:57.970
and you're giving the example
of tuberculosis and the time

00:10:57.970 --> 00:11:01.158
period and how lasting the
impact is.

00:11:01.158 --> 00:11:06.206
That tuberculosis has--one of
its reasons for having such an

00:11:06.206 --> 00:11:09.970
impact was that it was such a
slow event,

00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:14.230
and was with society for so
long, and people reflected on

00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:17.328
that,
and it impacted the arts and

00:11:17.328 --> 00:11:18.129
culture.
 

00:11:18.129 --> 00:11:20.350
Absolutely, I think that would
be.

00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:23.190
So, we've got now--in order to
deal with this,

00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:28.923
we've dealt with influenza and
tuberculosis as contrasting

00:11:28.923 --> 00:11:31.255
factors,
two diseases,

00:11:31.255 --> 00:11:33.519
in very different ways.
 

00:11:33.519 --> 00:11:37.644
And it's certainly true that
also on the exam we will be

00:11:37.644 --> 00:11:40.775
dealing--
I'll be asking you to be

00:11:40.775 --> 00:11:45.100
comparative in your discussion
of diseases,

00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:49.524
and to bring in more than one
disease in order to deal with

00:11:49.524 --> 00:11:53.950
major questions that cut across
the whole of our course.

00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:54.879
Okay, thanks.
 

00:11:54.879 --> 00:12:03.484
Anything else we ought to put
in to our answer to this

00:12:03.484 --> 00:12:05.269
question?
 

00:12:05.269 --> 00:12:09.615
Would it be good to deal with
just two diseases in dealing

00:12:09.615 --> 00:12:10.528
with that?
 

00:12:10.528 --> 00:12:17.260
Would this be--would you get an
A for bringing in influenza and

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:18.889
tuberculosis?
 

00:12:18.889 --> 00:12:24.950
What other diseases might be
important in considering this

00:12:24.950 --> 00:12:26.120
question?
 

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:30.580
Yes, thanks.
 

00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:45.168
**
Student:  You might

00:12:45.168 --> 00:12:47.490
consider cholera,
because it was sort of the

00:12:47.490 --> 00:12:51.154
opposite of tuberculosis,
in that it had a very rapid

00:12:51.154 --> 00:12:55.049
onset, and so the specifics
surrounding the disease itself

00:12:55.049 --> 00:12:58.399
had an effect on how it was
perceived as something

00:12:58.399 --> 00:13:01.970
frightening,
and something gross.

00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:03.129
Prof: Okay.
 

00:13:03.129 --> 00:13:06.269
So, you would throw cholera
into the mix.

00:13:06.269 --> 00:13:09.658
And I think the reason
you're--if I've understood you,

00:13:09.658 --> 00:13:12.976
you're saying that this should
take us into another whole

00:13:12.976 --> 00:13:15.509
realm,
which is to deal with the

00:13:15.509 --> 00:13:18.187
symptoms,
because there was something

00:13:18.187 --> 00:13:21.649
particularly frightening and
disgusting about Asiatic

00:13:21.649 --> 00:13:25.038
cholera,
and that conditioned its impact.

00:13:25.038 --> 00:13:29.222
People were really terrified by
its arrival, because of the

00:13:29.222 --> 00:13:31.460
nature of its symptomatology.
 

00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:35.210
That's another dimension that
we ought to consider.

00:13:35.210 --> 00:13:38.455
It's not just morbidity,
not just mortality,

00:13:38.455 --> 00:13:42.303
not just the profile of the
victims, but the kind of

00:13:42.303 --> 00:13:46.379
suffering that the disease
imposes on its victims.

00:13:46.379 --> 00:13:51.090
So, the symptomatology is
tremendously important.

00:13:51.090 --> 00:13:56.980
Okay, anything else on that
question?

00:13:56.980 --> 00:14:00.700
Our grade is going up all the
time.

00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:03.975
Several examples,
specific cases,

00:14:03.975 --> 00:14:09.298
that's comparison,
that's all extremely important.

00:14:09.298 --> 00:14:18.610
Anything else anyone wants to
throw in on this question?

00:14:18.610 --> 00:14:21.360
So, collectively we've got what?
 

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:24.240
An A on this?
 

00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:29.009
Okay, we'll pat ourselves on
the back, and let's move on and

00:14:29.009 --> 00:14:33.620
see if there are other issues we
might like to discuss.

00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:37.220
What is it--let me see,
I'm wondering--

00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:44.340
I mentioned something in
passing, and threw out a phrase,

00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:48.871
which was that we might want to
consider some diseases in our

00:14:48.871 --> 00:14:52.120
course "diseases of
modernity."

00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:56.080
I'm wondering if that's
actually a useful concept.

00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:57.960
It may be that I misspoke.
 

00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:04.337
Or is modernity in some senses
a factor that promotes our

00:15:04.337 --> 00:15:09.918
vulnerability to high-impact
epidemic diseases;

00:15:09.918 --> 00:15:12.159
or at least certain ones among
them?

00:15:12.159 --> 00:15:27.179
Is that true or is that wrong?
 

00:15:27.179 --> 00:15:28.918
Great.
 

00:15:28.918 --> 00:15:31.547
Student:  always like to
put a finer edge on it

00:15:31.547 --> 00:15:35.149
**
Prof: You really do, yes.

00:15:35.149 --> 00:15:40.360
**
Student: I might put a

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:44.183
finer edge on it for the class
by asking them if any real

00:15:44.183 --> 00:15:48.350
progress in social or medical
response to epidemic disease has

00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:51.559
occurred over the time span of
the course?

00:15:51.559 --> 00:15:53.389
Prof: Okay.
 

00:15:53.389 --> 00:15:56.428
In other words,
are we more vulnerable now,

00:15:56.428 --> 00:16:00.480
or much less vulnerable,
as a result of public health

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:04.610
policies and understanding of
infectious diseases,

00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:08.672
since, let's see,
poor Daniel Defoe lived through

00:16:08.672 --> 00:16:10.450
the bubonic plague.
 

00:16:10.450 --> 00:16:12.190
That's sort of your question,
right?

00:16:12.190 --> 00:16:13.370
Student:  Precisely.
 

00:16:13.370 --> 00:16:16.003
Student:  It struck me
that your definition of a

00:16:16.003 --> 00:16:18.539
disease of modernity refers to
structural factors.

00:16:18.539 --> 00:16:18.830
Right?
 

00:16:18.830 --> 00:16:21.224
So, for instance,
the role of mass transit

00:16:21.224 --> 00:16:23.326
technologies,
perhaps urbanization in

00:16:23.326 --> 00:16:25.370
abetting the spread of disease.
 

00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:28.759
Isn't that the sense of disease
of modernity?

00:16:28.759 --> 00:16:29.678
Prof: I think you're
right.

00:16:29.678 --> 00:16:33.970
Who knows what I meant when I
said it.

00:16:33.970 --> 00:16:37.389
But it would seem to me,
if we were retrospectively to

00:16:37.389 --> 00:16:40.940
try to make sense of a phrase
like that, we--and this is

00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:42.360
important and all.
 

00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:45.841
Here's a general point for any
answers that you give in an

00:16:45.841 --> 00:16:46.269
exam.
 

00:16:46.269 --> 00:16:50.837
You would have to provide a
definition of what it actually

00:16:50.837 --> 00:16:51.480
means.
 

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:55.210
Modernity is a lovely phrase,
but it doesn't really--

00:16:55.210 --> 00:16:57.181
its meaning is not
self-evident,

00:16:57.181 --> 00:17:00.759
and it was only--
your grade would rise very

00:17:00.759 --> 00:17:06.230
significantly if you weren't
just to talk about modernity,

00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:09.028
but you were actually to do
what you just did,

00:17:09.028 --> 00:17:11.130
but to say, "What does
that mean?"

00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:15.065
and point to factors such as
urbanization,

00:17:15.065 --> 00:17:18.039
mass transit,
population growth,

00:17:18.039 --> 00:17:22.358
things like that,
that give it a meaning;

00:17:22.358 --> 00:17:26.806
and possibly also the
development of an understanding

00:17:26.806 --> 00:17:31.251
scientifically of the biology
and the medicine of the

00:17:31.251 --> 00:17:34.604
diseases,
and therefore public health

00:17:34.604 --> 00:17:36.519
policies and practices.
 

00:17:36.519 --> 00:17:39.229
That, I think,
would be a much better way to

00:17:39.229 --> 00:17:42.944
approach this idea of whether
it's a disease of modernity or

00:17:42.944 --> 00:17:43.450
not.
 

00:17:43.450 --> 00:17:46.410
And I'm just wondering what
would you say?

00:17:46.410 --> 00:17:53.130
Are we less vulnerable now than
London was at the time of Defoe;

00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:57.707
or is it still the same;
or are we vulnerable,

00:17:57.707 --> 00:18:01.515
but vulnerable to different
kinds of diseases,

00:18:01.515 --> 00:18:03.970
at least here in the West?
 

00:18:03.970 --> 00:18:05.410
Okay, great.
 

00:18:05.410 --> 00:18:14.174
**
Student:  I would say

00:18:14.174 --> 00:18:18.929
that we're more vulnerable to
the spread of disease and to

00:18:18.929 --> 00:18:23.098
diseases that are a result of
over-sanitation,

00:18:23.098 --> 00:18:25.420
but that we're also more
capable of dealing with them,

00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:28.279
scientifically and
technologically.

00:18:28.279 --> 00:18:29.088
Prof: Okay.
 

00:18:29.088 --> 00:18:33.558
So, it's neither--you're
rejecting that opposition of

00:18:33.558 --> 00:18:36.308
being more or less vulnerable.
 

00:18:36.308 --> 00:18:39.430
We're more vulnerable in
certain ways,

00:18:39.430 --> 00:18:42.130
and less vulnerable in others.
 

00:18:42.130 --> 00:18:46.001
Perhaps we're not as
susceptible to certain diseases

00:18:46.001 --> 00:18:49.494
in the same way,
but we're susceptible to other

00:18:49.494 --> 00:18:51.848
diseases in different ways.
 

00:18:51.848 --> 00:18:56.180
Maybe the mode of transmission
is an important factor.

00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:57.900
But you wanted to say something
too.

00:18:57.900 --> 00:19:00.230
Let's come to you.
 

00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:07.749
**
Student:  I also think

00:19:07.749 --> 00:19:10.805
that in a way though we're sort
of like shifting from one vague

00:19:10.805 --> 00:19:13.220
misconception of disease
causality to another.

00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:16.547
Because the earliest modes of
disease prevention were

00:19:16.547 --> 00:19:19.809
quarantine and just,
like, whatever they could--like

00:19:19.809 --> 00:19:22.048
sanitation, like with Chadwick.
 

00:19:22.048 --> 00:19:24.268
But then we moved to this magic
bullet thing,

00:19:24.268 --> 00:19:26.788
once we figured out that it was
the germ theory.

00:19:26.788 --> 00:19:29.259
And for a really long time--and
I think it still sort of

00:19:29.259 --> 00:19:31.776
persists--is this idea that we
can cure something just by

00:19:31.776 --> 00:19:32.900
finding a magic drug.
 

00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:35.608
And that isn't really how it
works, and there are a lot of

00:19:35.608 --> 00:19:36.368
other factors.
 

00:19:36.368 --> 00:19:39.520
And even though we sort of
acknowledge that sometimes,

00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:42.375
I don't think that it's
necessarily permeated our

00:19:42.375 --> 00:19:45.230
efforts to cure a lot of
different diseases.

00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:47.440
Like with AIDS you can kind of
see that there's efforts at

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:48.720
education and things like that.
 

00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:52.682
But as long as there's poverty,
there's going to be diseases

00:19:52.682 --> 00:19:55.568
that disproportionately affect
the poor,

00:19:55.568 --> 00:19:58.278
and I don't think that we're
anywhere near solving that

00:19:58.278 --> 00:19:58.779
problem.
 

00:19:58.779 --> 00:19:59.460
Prof: Okay.
 

00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:04.423
So, as I understand it,
you're saying that we have made

00:20:04.423 --> 00:20:08.526
advances in understanding,
and there are diseases for

00:20:08.526 --> 00:20:11.838
which there are public health
measures that are effective,

00:20:11.838 --> 00:20:14.848
and there are sometimes magic
bullets.

00:20:14.848 --> 00:20:19.474
But we have become rather
over--we overemphasize the

00:20:19.474 --> 00:20:24.554
importance of treatments,
and we underestimate the social

00:20:24.554 --> 00:20:27.910
economic determinants of
disease.

00:20:27.910 --> 00:20:32.650
And, so, diseases thrive on
certain social and economic

00:20:32.650 --> 00:20:35.685
conditions--
and you mentioned poverty,

00:20:35.685 --> 00:20:39.945
for example--
and so until those underlying

00:20:39.945 --> 00:20:45.500
substrates of epidemic diseases
are dealt with,

00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:48.608
we'll always remain vulnerable.
 

00:20:48.608 --> 00:20:52.064
So, that would suggest--maybe
we should take that on for a

00:20:52.064 --> 00:20:52.608
second.
 

00:20:52.608 --> 00:20:58.380
Is that a valid conclusion from
the course,

00:20:58.380 --> 00:21:00.769
from your readings and all the
rest,

00:21:00.769 --> 00:21:03.164
that diseases,
all diseases,

00:21:03.164 --> 00:21:07.579
are diseases of poverty?--
would seem to be something you

00:21:07.579 --> 00:21:09.058
were maybe suggesting.
 

00:21:09.058 --> 00:21:12.023
Or even if you weren't,
I'm suggesting it on your

00:21:12.023 --> 00:21:12.578
behalf.
 

00:21:12.578 --> 00:21:15.880
Is that a valid conclusion to
draw;

00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:22.498
that really the essential
driver of epidemic disasters is

00:21:22.498 --> 00:21:23.680
poverty?
 

00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:26.650
All diseases are diseases of
poverty;

00:21:26.650 --> 00:21:34.950
is that right?
 

00:21:34.950 --> 00:21:35.390
Right.
 

00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:41.750
Great, thanks.
 

00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:43.772
Student:  I would
disagree with that statement

00:21:43.772 --> 00:21:45.660
because although--
Prof: Okay.

00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:47.529
I would too.
 

00:21:47.529 --> 00:21:49.500
Student:  We see that,
in some cases,

00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:52.630
notably cholera,
it did only strike the poor,

00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:56.440
and the rich were pretty much
unaffected by the disease,

00:21:56.440 --> 00:22:00.288
in terms of health, health-wise.
 

00:22:00.288 --> 00:22:03.448
There's been plenty of other
diseases that really haven't

00:22:03.448 --> 00:22:06.548
shown any liking to any specific
socioeconomic class.

00:22:06.548 --> 00:22:09.590
The flu just came in and,
since it was so easily spread

00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:13.423
from person to person,
even if you were walking into a

00:22:13.423 --> 00:22:16.548
store run by someone of a lower
class,

00:22:16.548 --> 00:22:18.348
you could easily get that from
them.

00:22:18.348 --> 00:22:22.366
So, I think most diseases,
even though some did strike the

00:22:22.366 --> 00:22:26.243
poor to a greater extent,
you can't classify them solely

00:22:26.243 --> 00:22:28.568
as being diseases of poverty.
 

00:22:28.568 --> 00:22:35.655
Where poverty might have--not
embellished--but poverty might

00:22:35.655 --> 00:22:39.740
have--imight have made it worse.
 

00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:42.730
Someone in poverty would
probably be worse off due to

00:22:42.730 --> 00:22:44.630
influenza than a richer person.
 

00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:47.015
But I don't think it caused
most of the diseases we've

00:22:47.015 --> 00:22:47.690
talked about.
 

00:22:47.690 --> 00:22:49.690
Prof: Okay.
 

00:22:49.690 --> 00:22:53.423
There is the theory,
then, that it really depends on

00:22:53.423 --> 00:22:56.593
which disease,
and that it's a gross

00:22:56.593 --> 00:23:02.271
oversimplification to say that
poverty is the cause of epidemic

00:23:02.271 --> 00:23:03.278
disease.
 

00:23:03.278 --> 00:23:07.778
It exacerbates the situation,
probably for all.

00:23:07.778 --> 00:23:14.107
But there are clearly certain
diseases that are driven by

00:23:14.107 --> 00:23:17.990
other factors--
and influenza was a case in

00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:22.058
point--there's certain diseases
that really do seem to be

00:23:22.058 --> 00:23:29.124
equal-opportunity afflictions,
in that they seem to strike all

00:23:29.124 --> 00:23:33.840
rungs of society,
rather than just certain

00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:36.140
economic and social classes.
 

00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:40.137
And influenza was a
good--respiratory diseases

00:23:40.137 --> 00:23:43.068
perhaps veer towards that pole.
 

00:23:43.068 --> 00:23:47.736
But then I think you're saying
that in any case it's probably

00:23:47.736 --> 00:23:51.470
not fair also completely to
eliminate poverty;

00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:55.738
that it's a sort of spectrum,
and some diseases are more

00:23:55.738 --> 00:23:58.920
responsive to poverty,
and others less.

00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:02.519
But that even
influenza---perhaps if you're

00:24:02.519 --> 00:24:06.205
poor, you don't have access to
medical care,

00:24:06.205 --> 00:24:10.150
to nursing, and to medications,
and so on.

00:24:10.150 --> 00:24:13.550
And, so, it's more of a
problem, but it's a universal

00:24:13.550 --> 00:24:14.990
problem nonetheless.
 

00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:17.009
Have I understood you right,
correctly?

00:24:17.009 --> 00:24:17.849
Okay.
 

00:24:17.849 --> 00:24:20.519
Good, thank you.
 

00:24:20.519 --> 00:24:22.298
I think you'd be right.
 

00:24:22.298 --> 00:24:27.230
And I think it would be good if
in the answer--

00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:31.310
let's say we give a more
coherent answer if we gave a

00:24:31.310 --> 00:24:35.078
range of diseases in dealing
with the answer,

00:24:35.078 --> 00:24:38.740
some at one end of the spectrum
and others at the other.

00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:39.470
Right?
 

00:24:39.470 --> 00:24:41.460
So, influenza would be great.
 

00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:45.189
But it would be a mistake just
to put influenza into the

00:24:45.189 --> 00:24:45.798
answer.
 

00:24:45.798 --> 00:24:48.940
We'd want to give contrasting
examples.

00:24:48.940 --> 00:24:51.868
The answer, then,
as many historical answers,

00:24:51.868 --> 00:24:56.288
has to be qualified and
nuanced, and just to say all

00:24:56.288 --> 00:25:01.400
diseases are diseases of poverty
is probably quite wrong.

00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:01.890
Okay.
 

00:25:01.890 --> 00:25:05.230
There was another--you were
going to--

00:25:05.230 --> 00:25:08.288
Student:  Well I was
just going to ask if we could

00:25:08.288 --> 00:25:11.618
maybe take the diseases that we
looked at and almost rank them

00:25:11.618 --> 00:25:13.640
in the order of how they
affect--

00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:16.820
like how much certain diseases
** from flu to

00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:17.380
cholera.
 

00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:18.078
Prof: Okay.
 

00:25:18.078 --> 00:25:22.794
Well, why don't I be a really,
really nasty person and ask if

00:25:22.794 --> 00:25:24.680
you could help me out?
 

00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:27.660
How would you rank them?
 

00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:28.740
Student:  I haven't got
a clue.

00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:31.278
**.
 

00:25:31.278 --> 00:25:33.589
Prof: You've got lots of
people to help you out.

00:25:33.589 --> 00:25:34.829
You're not on your own.
 

00:25:34.829 --> 00:25:35.808
Okay?
 

00:25:35.808 --> 00:25:36.599
Student: 
**.

00:25:36.599 --> 00:25:40.259
Prof: No.
 

00:25:40.259 --> 00:25:42.545
Student:  I would start
with flu and then I'd get to

00:25:42.545 --> 00:25:42.940
cholera.
 

00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:44.430
Prof: Okay.
 

00:25:44.430 --> 00:25:47.558
So, one end of the spectrum,
we put influenza;

00:25:47.558 --> 00:25:53.651
and that would clearly be the
least responsive to poverty as a

00:25:53.651 --> 00:25:54.548
driver.
 

00:25:54.548 --> 00:25:59.108
The other end of the spectrum
you'd put Asiatic cholera,

00:25:59.108 --> 00:26:06.068
which is clearly very sensitive
to social and economic factors,

00:26:06.068 --> 00:26:08.910
to living conditions,
to dirt and filth,

00:26:08.910 --> 00:26:11.358
to lack of light,
to overcrowding.

00:26:11.358 --> 00:26:15.701
I hope you would then--you see,
in your essay poverty too

00:26:15.701 --> 00:26:19.269
needs--it is not self-evident
what it means.

00:26:19.269 --> 00:26:21.259
Why is poverty a factor?
 

00:26:21.259 --> 00:26:27.382
And I hope you would talk about
filth, access to medical care,

00:26:27.382 --> 00:26:30.994
education, overcrowding,
bad housing,

00:26:30.994 --> 00:26:32.098
sewage.
 

00:26:32.098 --> 00:26:36.598
Those are the things that
cholera thrives on.

00:26:36.598 --> 00:26:41.162
So, you would be right that
way, putting influenza and

00:26:41.162 --> 00:26:44.950
cholera at opposite poles of the
spectrum.

00:26:44.950 --> 00:26:49.124
But once again,
we have to remember that this

00:26:49.124 --> 00:26:53.202
is not absolute,
because wealthy people also

00:26:53.202 --> 00:26:59.180
succumbed to Asiatic cholera,
just in much smaller numbers.

00:26:59.180 --> 00:27:00.480
Okay.
 

00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:02.348
Right, thanks.
 

00:27:02.348 --> 00:27:05.260
Student:  I think I
would put malaria,

00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:09.031
and to a lesser extent than
plague, on the cholera side of

00:27:09.031 --> 00:27:09.759
things.
 

00:27:09.759 --> 00:27:15.190
Malaria, because they--it was a
big working condition disease,

00:27:15.190 --> 00:27:18.311
and a lot of people who were in
the lower classes worked in the

00:27:18.311 --> 00:27:21.176
rice fields where--
and worked and lived in areas

00:27:21.176 --> 00:27:24.416
that they couldn't have the
simple protection against

00:27:24.416 --> 00:27:25.288
mosquitoes.
 

00:27:25.288 --> 00:27:28.948
And I said plague to a lesser
extent on the cholera side

00:27:28.948 --> 00:27:31.142
because,
as we saw in Journal of the

00:27:31.142 --> 00:27:33.920
Plague Year,
a lot of the richer people were

00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:37.599
able to leave London and use
financial means to get away from

00:27:37.599 --> 00:27:38.519
the disease.
 

00:27:38.519 --> 00:27:41.580
And even though it spread,
the poorer people couldn't do

00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:43.140
that and they had to stay.
 

00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:43.769
Prof: Okay.
 

00:27:43.769 --> 00:27:49.739
So, we have a couple of other
examples of diseases that might

00:27:49.739 --> 00:27:54.215
be along the level of
poverty--being driven by

00:27:54.215 --> 00:27:55.410
poverty.
 

00:27:55.410 --> 00:28:00.315
And malaria was an example
because of the particularly

00:28:00.315 --> 00:28:03.368
laboring and living conditions.
 

00:28:03.368 --> 00:28:06.664
It's partly an occupational
disease, and so it strikes

00:28:06.664 --> 00:28:10.146
peasants and people who work in
conditions that make them

00:28:10.146 --> 00:28:13.894
vulnerable;
and it's a house disease that

00:28:13.894 --> 00:28:19.521
depends on overcrowding and
living in housing that's porous

00:28:19.521 --> 00:28:21.558
to flying insects.
 

00:28:21.558 --> 00:28:26.170
Poverty clearly is important to
the spread of malaria.

00:28:26.170 --> 00:28:30.950
We've seen, to some extent,
that plague has some--

00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:34.756
it could be argued either way,
but you're absolutely right to

00:28:34.756 --> 00:28:38.875
introduce plague as something--
a case to be argued as to

00:28:38.875 --> 00:28:40.818
whether it is or isn't.
 

00:28:40.818 --> 00:28:45.220
I'm wondering what about some
other diseases transmitted

00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:46.338
differently?
 

00:28:46.338 --> 00:28:50.685
One factor might be--then you
might say it might depend partly

00:28:50.685 --> 00:28:53.680
on means of transmission of the
disease;

00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:58.338
perhaps airborne disease is
less driven by poverty.

00:28:58.338 --> 00:29:01.508
Ones that travel by the
oral-fecal route,

00:29:01.508 --> 00:29:04.358
or by vectors,
might be important.

00:29:04.358 --> 00:29:07.269
What about sexually transmitted
disease;

00:29:07.269 --> 00:29:10.279
and is syphilis a disease of
poverty?

00:29:10.279 --> 00:29:15.798
You wanted to--
Student:  I would put

00:29:15.798 --> 00:29:21.990
AIDS and syphilis towards the
flu end of things.

00:29:21.990 --> 00:29:28.611
Although by modern maps of
where these diseases are highly

00:29:28.611 --> 00:29:32.910
prevalent, it would seem
otherwise.

00:29:32.910 --> 00:29:38.883
But I think that there is
actually a sort of not

00:29:38.883 --> 00:29:42.950
poverty-based reason for that.
 

00:29:42.950 --> 00:29:43.630
Prof: Okay.
 

00:29:43.630 --> 00:29:48.708
So, we have a candidate then
for--two other candidates to go

00:29:48.708 --> 00:29:53.700
at the influenza end of the
spectrum: syphilis and AIDS.

00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:58.250
I'm wondering if everyone would
agree with that.

00:29:58.250 --> 00:29:59.829
Yes, please?
 

00:29:59.829 --> 00:30:00.970
Oh sorry.
 

00:30:00.970 --> 00:30:02.460
Go ahead first.
 

00:30:02.460 --> 00:30:05.303
Student:  Yes,
I would put AIDS more towards

00:30:05.303 --> 00:30:08.146
the middle of the spectrum,
because AIDS did have a

00:30:08.146 --> 00:30:10.480
predilection for marginalized
groups.

00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:13.560
But at the same time it could
affect anyone,

00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:17.358
including a heterosexual man
from a wealthy family.

00:30:17.358 --> 00:30:19.720
So, I think it sort of goes in
the middle.

00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:22.905
If I could add one to the list,
maybe I would put SARS as

00:30:22.905 --> 00:30:25.240
closer to the flu end of the
spectrum,

00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:28.210
because it did seem to--and
this adds to the idea that

00:30:28.210 --> 00:30:30.900
airborne diseases are less
driven by poverty--

00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:34.558
because it did seem to affect
everyone.

00:30:34.558 --> 00:30:38.000
But at the same time,
it did hit areas that had a

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:42.085
strong health infrastructure,
and that helped to quell the

00:30:42.085 --> 00:30:43.589
disease somewhat.
 

00:30:43.589 --> 00:30:44.358
Prof: Okay.
 

00:30:44.358 --> 00:30:48.615
I'm wondering--I like your
answer and I'm just wondering if

00:30:48.615 --> 00:30:52.798
with HIV/AIDS we would want even
to make distinctions,

00:30:52.798 --> 00:30:57.538
in that HIV/AIDS seems to have
different phases and different

00:30:57.538 --> 00:31:00.653
epidemiologies,
according to different

00:31:00.653 --> 00:31:04.019
circumstances;
and that in the industrial West

00:31:04.019 --> 00:31:07.515
it seems to be a disease,
more of marginal groups,

00:31:07.515 --> 00:31:09.369
at least at the moment.
 

00:31:09.369 --> 00:31:11.000
It used not to be.
 

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:14.617
When it was first introduced
into the United States,

00:31:14.617 --> 00:31:17.101
for example,
it wasn't an example of

00:31:17.101 --> 00:31:21.221
socioeconomic marginality;
but rather people who,

00:31:21.221 --> 00:31:26.563
because of sexual orientation,
or through blood supplies and

00:31:26.563 --> 00:31:27.650
so forth.
 

00:31:27.650 --> 00:31:31.288
But it would seem that if you
were dealing at a global level

00:31:31.288 --> 00:31:33.471
now,
with AIDS in Africa for

00:31:33.471 --> 00:31:38.192
example, poverty does seem to be
a very important factor in the

00:31:38.192 --> 00:31:39.029
disease.
 

00:31:39.029 --> 00:31:41.059
Would you not agree with that?
 

00:31:41.059 --> 00:31:41.828
Student:  Yes definitely.
 

00:31:41.828 --> 00:31:44.893
I think in countries where
there is more wealth,

00:31:44.893 --> 00:31:47.369
it's seen more as a chronic
disease.

00:31:47.369 --> 00:31:49.440
So, definitely.
 

00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:49.807
Prof: Okay.
 

00:31:49.807 --> 00:31:50.279
Great, well thank you.
 

00:31:50.279 --> 00:31:54.471
So, we could even
talk--divide--break some of the

00:31:54.471 --> 00:31:59.799
diseases down into different
periods in their transmission.

00:31:59.799 --> 00:32:01.250
And you wanted to add something?
 

00:32:01.250 --> 00:32:01.980
Student:  That was the
comment.

00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:03.682
Prof: Oh,
that was what you wanted to

00:32:03.682 --> 00:32:03.920
add.
 

00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:04.690
Okay.
 

00:32:04.690 --> 00:32:06.440
Well, there's another.
 

00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:11.058
Thank you.
 

00:32:11.058 --> 00:32:13.222
Student:  I was just
going to say that tuberculosis

00:32:13.222 --> 00:32:17.044
should be added to the list--
probably more on the end of

00:32:17.044 --> 00:32:20.314
influenza--
simply because they kind of

00:32:20.314 --> 00:32:24.269
regarded it as disease of the
rich for some time--

00:32:24.269 --> 00:32:26.568
and a disease of genius,
I think it was--

00:32:26.568 --> 00:32:30.779
because of the people that it
affected.

00:32:30.779 --> 00:32:32.009
Prof: Okay.
 

00:32:32.009 --> 00:32:36.265
So, there's the thought that
maybe tuberculosis ought to be

00:32:36.265 --> 00:32:39.640
added to the influenza end of
the spectrum,

00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:42.001
in that it seemed to be,
looking back on the

00:32:42.001 --> 00:32:44.640
nineteenth-century experience of
the disease,

00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:48.170
it was even described as a
disease of beauty,

00:32:48.170 --> 00:32:49.200
of genius.
 

00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:53.665
And clearly we can make a long
list of high society

00:32:53.665 --> 00:32:58.133
people--celebrities,
artists, kings and queens--who

00:32:58.133 --> 00:33:01.259
were afflicted by tuberculosis.
 

00:33:01.259 --> 00:33:04.262
And I think that if you were
dealing with the nineteenth

00:33:04.262 --> 00:33:06.992
century, that would be a
splendid argument to make,

00:33:06.992 --> 00:33:08.848
and I agree with you entirely.
 

00:33:08.848 --> 00:33:11.650
I'm just wondering though if we
come forward,

00:33:11.650 --> 00:33:16.390
fast forward in time to today,
then I think we have to say

00:33:16.390 --> 00:33:21.380
that the epidemiology of
tuberculosis today is different,

00:33:21.380 --> 00:33:25.650
and that it thrives on
preexisting conditions,

00:33:25.650 --> 00:33:28.308
on overcrowding.
 

00:33:28.308 --> 00:33:32.779
So, I think the time period can
also be important.

00:33:32.779 --> 00:33:37.826
Tuberculosis has retreated to
areas of poverty,

00:33:37.826 --> 00:33:40.130
I would argue,
now.

00:33:40.130 --> 00:33:42.690
Would you agree with that?
 

00:33:42.690 --> 00:33:43.150
Student:  Yes.
 

00:33:43.150 --> 00:33:45.440
I was going to say that what
you were just talking about;

00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:49.887
how, like, different time eras
actually can delineate whether

00:33:49.887 --> 00:33:53.150
or not it is a disease of
poverty or not,

00:33:53.150 --> 00:33:55.088
just by the people that it
affects,

00:33:55.088 --> 00:34:00.170
the effect it has on the
society at the present moment.

00:34:00.170 --> 00:34:01.259
Prof: Okay,
thanks very much.

00:34:01.259 --> 00:34:01.950
Yes.
 

00:34:01.950 --> 00:34:07.914
I think we're seeing that
describing diseases as diseases

00:34:07.914 --> 00:34:14.518
of poverty is really a complex
and also debatable position,

00:34:14.518 --> 00:34:17.320
and it depends on what
diseases, where,

00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:19.739
when and so forth.
 

00:34:19.739 --> 00:34:23.974
It's actually--one needs to
break down what poverty is,

00:34:23.974 --> 00:34:27.659
and one needs to have a
spectrum of diseases.

00:34:27.659 --> 00:34:31.010
But I think we're dealing with
it much more effectively.

00:34:31.010 --> 00:34:34.706
And I think one of the things
we see is that the more

00:34:34.706 --> 00:34:38.405
complexity, the more nuance,
the better our answer is

00:34:38.405 --> 00:34:41.059
becoming;
also the more interesting.

00:34:41.059 --> 00:34:46.161
I think it's rather a bland and
not very convincing answer to

00:34:46.161 --> 00:34:50.500
say simply all diseases are
diseases of poverty,

00:34:50.500 --> 00:34:54.614
and I think we now see that
actually the situation is much

00:34:54.614 --> 00:34:58.548
more complex than that;
that poverty's an important

00:34:58.548 --> 00:35:03.518
factor but it doesn't simply--we
can't reduce our course to that

00:35:03.518 --> 00:35:04.780
one variable.
 

00:35:04.780 --> 00:35:06.530
Okay.
 

00:35:06.530 --> 00:35:11.501
In the meanwhile have you
thought of other questions that

00:35:11.501 --> 00:35:15.409
we ought to be dealing with in
our course?

00:35:15.409 --> 00:35:19.697
Or shall I put it another way;
are there major themes in our

00:35:19.697 --> 00:35:20.380
course?
 

00:35:20.380 --> 00:35:24.250
What--could we make maybe a
shortlist of themes that you

00:35:24.250 --> 00:35:27.840
should be thinking about as you
do your revision?

00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:32.168
What are the major themes that
we've been dealing with this

00:35:32.168 --> 00:35:32.989
semester?
 

00:35:32.989 --> 00:35:36.139
Disease and poverty is an
example.

00:35:36.139 --> 00:35:45.119
Are there other themes?
 

00:35:45.119 --> 00:35:47.710
Go for it.
 

00:35:47.710 --> 00:35:49.800
Student:  I guess
another theme has been the magic

00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:51.219
bullet theory of combating
disease,

00:35:51.219 --> 00:35:55.141
and the idea that any epidemic
disease can be solved basically

00:35:55.141 --> 00:35:58.679
by coming up with some sort of
scientific cure that--

00:35:58.679 --> 00:36:03.550
so just, I guess,
quinine in the case of malaria.

00:36:03.550 --> 00:36:07.510
I guess in the case of--or
quinine and then DDT in the case

00:36:07.510 --> 00:36:08.400
of malaria.
 

00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:11.764
And I guess that theme has been
one that has sort of been

00:36:11.764 --> 00:36:15.487
underlying what has been sort of
this triumphal age of American

00:36:15.487 --> 00:36:17.487
medicine,
and one that I think,

00:36:17.487 --> 00:36:19.969
at least in emerging and
remerging disease,

00:36:19.969 --> 00:36:22.822
is something that we're
increasingly viewing as not

00:36:22.822 --> 00:36:25.905
exactly the most effective way
of dealing with epidemic

00:36:25.905 --> 00:36:26.590
disease.
 

00:36:26.590 --> 00:36:27.960
Prof: Okay,
thanks very much.

00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:32.873
Yes, one of the--another theme
of our course has been the

00:36:32.873 --> 00:36:38.226
tendency to think of finding a
magic bullet to each infectious

00:36:38.226 --> 00:36:39.280
disease.
 

00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:42.728
And you were just starting to
do what I think would then be

00:36:42.728 --> 00:36:46.119
really important if that were a
question on the final,

00:36:46.119 --> 00:36:50.219
which is to look at what is the
history of magic bullets,

00:36:50.219 --> 00:36:53.960
and have they actually
delivered on the promise

00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:55.829
associated with them?
 

00:36:55.829 --> 00:36:59.300
And examples that you
gave--let's see,

00:36:59.300 --> 00:37:06.170
quinine with regard to malaria,
or later on DDT with regard to

00:37:06.170 --> 00:37:10.012
malaria,
and has that--would that

00:37:10.012 --> 00:37:16.409
be--would malaria be a good
example of a disease that's been

00:37:16.409 --> 00:37:20.530
highly responsive to magic
bullets?

00:37:20.530 --> 00:37:22.219
You're shaking your head.
 

00:37:22.219 --> 00:37:24.960
Do you want to add to your
headshake?

00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:26.000
Student:  No.
 

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:30.474
Because there were side effects
to these mass treatments,

00:37:30.474 --> 00:37:33.672
and it wasn't a
one-size-fits-all sort of

00:37:33.672 --> 00:37:35.590
response to malaria.
 

00:37:35.590 --> 00:37:39.179
And there were other social
factors that weren't considered.

00:37:39.179 --> 00:37:42.742
And people were thinking at
that time that if we applied DDT

00:37:42.742 --> 00:37:45.760
for a certain amount of time,
then malaria would be

00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:47.150
eradicated forever.
 

00:37:47.150 --> 00:37:49.967
But that certainly wasn't the
case, and conditions could

00:37:49.967 --> 00:37:51.760
change and the disease came
back.

00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:57.170
I think it was the case near
Italy where they built the dam,

00:37:57.170 --> 00:37:59.119
and then during the war the dam
was broken,

00:37:59.119 --> 00:38:01.530
and then later the disease came
back,

00:38:01.530 --> 00:38:02.409
during the war.
 

00:38:02.409 --> 00:38:06.137
So, these measures aren't
permanent, as they thought they

00:38:06.137 --> 00:38:07.268
initially were.
 

00:38:07.268 --> 00:38:12.710
In that sense this magic bullet
can't be the permanent final

00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:13.539
answer.
 

00:38:13.539 --> 00:38:14.090
Prof: Okay.
 

00:38:14.090 --> 00:38:19.590
So, we have a problem with
malaria.

00:38:19.590 --> 00:38:23.581
There was this great euphoria
of thinking that a magic bullet

00:38:23.581 --> 00:38:27.193
could be found,
and quinine and DDT were

00:38:27.193 --> 00:38:32.923
examples, but they ended up not
actually delivering on the

00:38:32.923 --> 00:38:34.030
promise.
 

00:38:34.030 --> 00:38:37.418
Chloroquine would be yet
another example of a magic

00:38:37.418 --> 00:38:39.789
bullet, for dealing with
malaria.

00:38:39.789 --> 00:38:41.599
So, I would agree entirely.
 

00:38:41.599 --> 00:38:46.550
Malaria would be a wonderful
example of enormous expectations

00:38:46.550 --> 00:38:51.065
of a magic bullet as a solution,
and yet we see that,

00:38:51.065 --> 00:38:55.860
in fact, the biology of the
disease is much more complicated

00:38:55.860 --> 00:38:58.949
than being dealt with in that
way,

00:38:58.949 --> 00:39:04.038
and we've seen resistance being
developed by mosquitoes and by

00:39:04.038 --> 00:39:05.039
plasmodia.
 

00:39:05.039 --> 00:39:08.157
And, so, the promise of the
magic bullets,

00:39:08.157 --> 00:39:11.199
with malaria,
turned out to be a tool.

00:39:11.199 --> 00:39:15.742
And they're useful but they
haven't rid the world at all of

00:39:15.742 --> 00:39:16.840
the disease.
 

00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:21.159
And there was--you wanted also
to say something.

00:39:21.159 --> 00:39:21.650
Student:  Yes.
 

00:39:21.650 --> 00:39:24.934
And I think to go along with
that, there's another reason why

00:39:24.934 --> 00:39:26.960
magic bullets can't entirely
work--

00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:28.500
and that's another theme of the
class--

00:39:28.500 --> 00:39:31.768
which is the idea of disease as
a social construction.

00:39:31.768 --> 00:39:36.411
And the fact is that even if a
magic bullet can have a great

00:39:36.411 --> 00:39:40.110
effect on the biology,
or the symptomatology,

00:39:40.110 --> 00:39:43.219
of a disease--
I think Barnes is the author

00:39:43.219 --> 00:39:47.422
who really went into the idea
that in order to really attack a

00:39:47.422 --> 00:39:50.963
disease,
it goes into the substratum of

00:39:50.963 --> 00:39:56.300
society and to our ideas about
disease and what we place,

00:39:56.300 --> 00:39:58.460
the stigma that we place on
them.

00:39:58.460 --> 00:39:59.469
Prof: Okay.
 

00:39:59.469 --> 00:40:03.469
So we can't just think in terms
of magic bullets.

00:40:03.469 --> 00:40:06.949
We also have to think about the
ideas in people's heads.

00:40:06.949 --> 00:40:08.780
How do they understand the
disease?

00:40:08.780 --> 00:40:11.099
What's the social construction?
 

00:40:11.099 --> 00:40:16.780
And you gave the example of
tuberculosis as a good example.

00:40:16.780 --> 00:40:19.800
Okay, I would entirely agree
with that too.

00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:24.717
I'm wondering if there are
other examples of magic bullets

00:40:24.717 --> 00:40:29.809
that have either delivered on
the promise, or have failed to

00:40:29.809 --> 00:40:32.139
deliver on the promise.
 

00:40:32.139 --> 00:40:36.190
We've talked about malaria:
quinine, DDT,

00:40:36.190 --> 00:40:37.610
chloroquine.
 

00:40:37.610 --> 00:40:41.233
What about other--have magic
bullets played a role in our

00:40:41.233 --> 00:40:43.110
course with other diseases?
 

00:40:43.110 --> 00:40:51.179
Yes, go for it.
 

00:40:51.179 --> 00:40:54.231
Student:  The original
magic bullet was with syphilis

00:40:54.231 --> 00:40:55.989
though--right?--with penicillin.
 

00:40:55.989 --> 00:40:58.380
And I think that was a pretty
good example.

00:40:58.380 --> 00:41:00.873
I mean, and Brandt's point,
in No Magic Bullet,

00:41:00.873 --> 00:41:02.898
is that it didn't really--I
mean, it helped,

00:41:02.898 --> 00:41:04.969
but it didn't really slow the
incidence.

00:41:04.969 --> 00:41:07.110
Like it would sort of go in
crests and waves,

00:41:07.110 --> 00:41:09.824
where there were people who
were soldiers in the army and

00:41:09.824 --> 00:41:12.597
they would get prostitutes,
and then it kind of didn't

00:41:12.597 --> 00:41:15.690
really matter whether there was
a cure for syphilis or not,

00:41:15.690 --> 00:41:18.690
because like they just wouldn't
have had access to it;

00:41:18.690 --> 00:41:20.670
like even if they contracted
the disease.

00:41:20.670 --> 00:41:23.976
So, education and other
programs like that are just as

00:41:23.976 --> 00:41:26.847
important as drugs,
when it comes to preventing

00:41:26.847 --> 00:41:28.469
something like an STD.
 

00:41:28.469 --> 00:41:29.599
Prof: Okay.
 

00:41:29.599 --> 00:41:34.896
The history of syphilis would
be another good case study for

00:41:34.896 --> 00:41:39.923
whether magic bullets are the
way to eradicate or control

00:41:39.923 --> 00:41:41.630
major diseases.
 

00:41:41.630 --> 00:41:45.889
And you used the example of
penicillin, which is a good one.

00:41:45.889 --> 00:41:48.581
But I think we've had,
with syphilis,

00:41:48.581 --> 00:41:52.094
even further back,
other things that at the time

00:41:52.094 --> 00:41:54.860
were thought of as magic
bullets;

00:41:54.860 --> 00:41:58.264
mercury before that,
and salversan,

00:41:58.264 --> 00:42:03.974
would be other earlier ideas
considered magic bullets that

00:42:03.974 --> 00:42:07.780
also didn't eliminate the
disease.

00:42:07.780 --> 00:42:12.074
The diseases tend to be much
more complicated than to be

00:42:12.074 --> 00:42:15.590
simply amenable to a magic
bullet solution.

00:42:15.590 --> 00:42:19.920
So, syphilis is another
example, along with malaria.

00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:20.610
Right?
 

00:42:20.610 --> 00:42:23.099
Are there other examples?
 

00:42:23.099 --> 00:42:23.599
Yes?
 

00:42:23.599 --> 00:42:26.092
Student:  One instance
where this magic bullet idea did

00:42:26.092 --> 00:42:27.889
seem to work was in the case of
smallpox,

00:42:27.889 --> 00:42:34.280
where a vaccine was developed
and given to all the population,

00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:37.920
such that the disease no longer
had a host of humans,

00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:41.431
a reserve full of hosts to
infect, and the disease

00:42:41.431 --> 00:42:43.440
eventually was eradicated.
 

00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:47.826
And I think that's one example
where this magic bullet was

00:42:47.826 --> 00:42:48.750
effective.
 

00:42:48.750 --> 00:42:52.960
But it was a very special case,
in the case of smallpox,

00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:56.789
because the smallpox vaccine
was very effective.

00:42:56.789 --> 00:43:01.260
And I think we talked about how
it's very much disease-specific.

00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:04.956
And smallpox seems to be an
exception rather than the rule,

00:43:04.956 --> 00:43:07.570
in terms of how magic bullets
can work.

00:43:07.570 --> 00:43:09.050
Prof: Okay, thanks.
 

00:43:09.050 --> 00:43:13.760
So, we need to be careful,
even in our skepticism about

00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:17.423
magic bullets,
that there may be cases when

00:43:17.423 --> 00:43:21.719
they can actually work;
and a good example being

00:43:21.719 --> 00:43:25.920
smallpox in which the vaccine
has actually eradicated

00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:29.719
naturally-occurring smallpox
from the world.

00:43:29.719 --> 00:43:30.889
There are examples.
 

00:43:30.889 --> 00:43:34.804
But then one has--you were also
saying what lessons should be

00:43:34.804 --> 00:43:36.239
drawn from smallpox?
 

00:43:36.239 --> 00:43:40.143
And you were saying perhaps one
of the lessons though is that

00:43:40.143 --> 00:43:41.639
smallpox is atypical.
 

00:43:41.639 --> 00:43:46.342
It had certain specific
features about it that made it

00:43:46.342 --> 00:43:50.869
particularly vulnerable to
attack by vaccination.

00:43:50.869 --> 00:43:55.722
But we can't throw out then the
hope for finding tools that will

00:43:55.722 --> 00:44:00.487
actually eradicate diseases,
and smallpox is an example of

00:44:00.487 --> 00:44:03.110
something that really did work.
 

00:44:03.110 --> 00:44:04.360
Yes, okay.
 

00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:12.250
Any other examples that ought
to be thrown into our mix?

00:44:12.250 --> 00:44:13.518
How about TB?
 

00:44:13.518 --> 00:44:17.170
And streptomycin would be
another example,

00:44:17.170 --> 00:44:21.150
I would think,
of something that seemed,

00:44:21.150 --> 00:44:25.286
after World War II,
that it would be possible to

00:44:25.286 --> 00:44:30.228
close all of the sanitaria;
and that largely happened,

00:44:30.228 --> 00:44:35.559
and the outlook seemed to be
that TB would be eliminated by

00:44:35.559 --> 00:44:37.489
this magic bullet.
 

00:44:37.489 --> 00:44:41.409
But we see again the problem of
drug resistance,

00:44:41.409 --> 00:44:46.079
and we're living now in a world
in which there's multiple

00:44:46.079 --> 00:44:48.750
drug-resistant tuberculosis.
 

00:44:48.750 --> 00:44:54.034
And, so, once again we have an
example of a disease that's been

00:44:54.034 --> 00:44:58.764
much more recalcitrant,
because we see the--I guess

00:44:58.764 --> 00:45:04.097
that Darwin was right--
the influence of evolution and

00:45:04.097 --> 00:45:08.539
its impact on the microbes
surrounding us.

00:45:08.539 --> 00:45:09.610
Okay.
 

00:45:09.610 --> 00:45:13.559
Is there another major theme of
our course?

00:45:13.559 --> 00:45:18.900
We've seen magic bullets,
we've seen poverty,

00:45:18.900 --> 00:45:25.092
we've seen modes of
transmission as major impacts on

00:45:25.092 --> 00:45:26.550
disease.
 

00:45:26.550 --> 00:45:29.920
We've talked about mortality,
morbidity,

00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:33.099
and whether--how you--what are
the--

00:45:33.099 --> 00:45:36.929
symptomatology--what are the
factors that contribute to the

00:45:36.929 --> 00:45:39.110
impact of a disease on society?
 

00:45:39.110 --> 00:45:41.369
We have just a few more minutes.
 

00:45:41.369 --> 00:45:50.286
So, I'm wondering if we have at
least one more candidate for a

00:45:50.286 --> 00:45:54.380
major theme of our course.
 

00:45:54.380 --> 00:45:55.940
Yes?
 

00:45:55.940 --> 00:45:59.170
Student:  The evolution
of public health strategies in

00:45:59.170 --> 00:46:00.840
response to epidemic disease.
 

00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:01.630
Prof: Okay.
 

00:46:01.630 --> 00:46:02.320
That's not fair.
 

00:46:02.320 --> 00:46:03.639
You read my mind.
 

00:46:03.639 --> 00:46:05.960
I was thinking of exactly that.
 

00:46:05.960 --> 00:46:10.610
And I did want to say that it
would be unfortunate if you went

00:46:10.610 --> 00:46:15.034
to the final exam in our course
without also thinking about

00:46:15.034 --> 00:46:19.228
public health as a major theme
that we've covered in our

00:46:19.228 --> 00:46:20.219
course.
 

00:46:20.219 --> 00:46:23.679
And let me just--could we make
a list now?

00:46:23.679 --> 00:46:29.048
We don't have time for
discussion, but what are some of

00:46:29.048 --> 00:46:35.014
the major forms of public health
strategy that we have talked

00:46:35.014 --> 00:46:36.010
about?
 

00:46:36.010 --> 00:46:37.440
Okay.
 

00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:39.059
Student:  Quarantine.
 

00:46:39.059 --> 00:46:39.889
Prof: Okay.
 

00:46:39.889 --> 00:46:40.989
Quarantine.
 

00:46:40.989 --> 00:46:45.858
And maybe we might enlarge that
by saying--could we talk about

00:46:45.858 --> 00:46:50.489
plague strategies of defense
against infectious disease?

00:46:50.489 --> 00:46:53.550
Meaning quarantines,
sanitary cordons,

00:46:53.550 --> 00:46:58.181
possibly lazarettos and pest
houses, all the rest that go

00:46:58.181 --> 00:46:59.340
with that.
 

00:46:59.340 --> 00:47:03.418
Yes, that's a recurrent--and
that's not only against plague,

00:47:03.418 --> 00:47:07.222
but plague strategies were
rolled out again and again in

00:47:07.222 --> 00:47:08.260
our course.
 

00:47:08.260 --> 00:47:11.340
We've seen them applied,
not very helpfully,

00:47:11.340 --> 00:47:12.630
against cholera.
 

00:47:12.630 --> 00:47:17.148
We've seen them also--plague
strategies--being applied

00:47:17.148 --> 00:47:20.389
against HIV/AIDS,
in the early days.

00:47:20.389 --> 00:47:24.699
Okay, so that's one style of
public health.

00:47:24.699 --> 00:47:32.420
What other measures of public
health have we seen?

00:47:32.420 --> 00:47:33.280
Yes?
 

00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:35.804
Student:  We've seen
vaccinations,

00:47:35.804 --> 00:47:38.139
concealment,
educational campaigns.

00:47:38.139 --> 00:47:40.641
Prof: Okay,
you've got a list here,

00:47:40.641 --> 00:47:42.289
that's three more styles.
 

00:47:42.289 --> 00:47:47.478
We've seen vaccination as--you
remember going back to Edward

00:47:47.478 --> 00:47:51.436
Jenner and--that was a long time
ago, I admit,

00:47:51.436 --> 00:47:54.690
but that's important to
remember.

00:47:54.690 --> 00:47:58.416
There were--we've also seen
concealment, and we saw

00:47:58.416 --> 00:48:00.949
concealment in the case of SARS.
 

00:48:00.949 --> 00:48:06.250
It occurred in the case of
cholera, in our course.

00:48:06.250 --> 00:48:12.179
We've talked about education
and its impact on public health.

00:48:12.179 --> 00:48:15.351
Are there other styles of
public health that we've come

00:48:15.351 --> 00:48:15.880
across?
 

00:48:15.880 --> 00:48:16.440
Yes?
 

00:48:16.440 --> 00:48:18.289
Student:  Miasmatism,
for a time.

00:48:18.289 --> 00:48:19.260
Prof: Okay.
 

00:48:19.260 --> 00:48:23.601
We've seen public health based
on miasmatism,

00:48:23.601 --> 00:48:27.449
and with the filth theory of
disease.

00:48:27.449 --> 00:48:34.507
And therefore sanitation,
introducing urban cleanups,

00:48:34.507 --> 00:48:39.425
sewer systems;
even the rebuilding of cites,

00:48:39.425 --> 00:48:42.929
as we saw under Haussmann in
France.

00:48:42.929 --> 00:48:46.789
And we saw that in the
rebuilding of Naples also.

00:48:46.789 --> 00:48:52.480
So, those are additional styles
of public health.

00:48:52.480 --> 00:48:56.630
Anything else anyone wants to
throw in?

00:48:56.630 --> 00:49:01.748
Or is there maybe another final
sort of question or theme of the

00:49:01.748 --> 00:49:02.480
course?
 

00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:05.244
We've just briefly suggested
public health,

00:49:05.244 --> 00:49:06.760
and a few dimensions.
 

00:49:06.760 --> 00:49:10.436
There are others,
and I hope that you'll dig them

00:49:10.436 --> 00:49:11.280
out also.
 

00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:21.980
Is there any final question
anyone wants to bring up?

00:49:21.980 --> 00:49:22.550
Yes?
 

00:49:22.550 --> 00:49:25.492
Student:  I think maybe
we missed the intrusion of the

00:49:25.492 --> 00:49:27.210
modern state played a role in
it;

00:49:27.210 --> 00:49:30.730
dispensaries and registries of
victims of disease.

00:49:30.730 --> 00:49:32.119
Prof: Okay, okay.
 

00:49:32.119 --> 00:49:36.782
We could discuss also the way
in which the modern state has

00:49:36.782 --> 00:49:40.239
played a role in the control of
disease,

00:49:40.239 --> 00:49:43.780
and that we can see that in
tuberculosis,

00:49:43.780 --> 00:49:46.840
through dispensaries, sanatoria.
 

00:49:46.840 --> 00:49:52.081
We can see that also playing a
role through malaria,

00:49:52.081 --> 00:49:57.219
and the same sort of idea of
dispensaries again.

00:49:57.219 --> 00:49:59.179
And there are other diseases as
well.

00:49:59.179 --> 00:50:03.349
The state playing a role in
education, the state playing a

00:50:03.349 --> 00:50:05.909
role in the plague measures
also.

00:50:05.909 --> 00:50:10.465
So, I think we can see the role
of the state as a major player,

00:50:10.465 --> 00:50:13.844
a central player,
in public health could indeed

00:50:13.844 --> 00:50:16.710
be an important theme of our
class.

00:50:16.710 --> 00:50:20.652
But having said that,
another theme is stopping when

00:50:20.652 --> 00:50:22.510
we've run out of time.
 

00:50:22.510 --> 00:50:25.068
And, so, I'll do that,
and wish you good luck on the

00:50:25.068 --> 00:50:25.469
final.
 

00:50:25.469 --> 00:50:28.909
And thank you this morning for
helping us put our heads

00:50:28.909 --> 00:50:29.610
together.
 

00:50:29.610 --> 00:50:31.860
And I liked your comments.
 

00:50:31.860 --> 00:50:33.360
Thanks very much.
 

00:50:33.360 --> 00:50:35.510

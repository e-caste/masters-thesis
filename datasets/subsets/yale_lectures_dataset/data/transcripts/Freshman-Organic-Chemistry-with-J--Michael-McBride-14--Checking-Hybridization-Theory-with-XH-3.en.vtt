00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:06.684
Prof: Okay,
so we're in the payoff period

00:00:06.684 --> 00:00:10.470
of having spent all this time on
quantum mechanics,

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:14.861
and we want to see first
whether what we've done is

00:00:14.861 --> 00:00:16.530
realistic or not.
 

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:20.450
So last time we looked at H-H
and H-F,

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:23.260
in terms of what the bond
strengths were,

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:27.492
and we saw that indeed one of
them was more stable for

00:00:27.492 --> 00:00:32.203
breaking into ions and the other
more stable with respect to

00:00:32.203 --> 00:00:34.120
breaking into atoms.
 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.543
But here's a more extensive
reality check today,

00:00:38.543 --> 00:00:43.250
which involves a lot more
experimental evidence.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:50.743
And it has to do with XH_3;
that is, the molecules BH_3,

00:00:50.743 --> 00:00:53.360
CH_3 and NH_3.
 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.303
And we're going to look at
their structure,

00:00:56.303 --> 00:00:59.456
and how they move,
and see how that checks out

00:00:59.456 --> 00:01:02.119
with what we expect
theoretically.

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:04.379
So first, what do we expect
theoretically?

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.462
Well BH_3, CH_3_,
NH_3_ are the

00:01:08.462 --> 00:01:12.218
same, except boron has three
valence electrons,

00:01:12.218 --> 00:01:15.730
carbon has four,
and nitrogen has five.

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:20.081
Now each of them uses three of
their valence electrons to share

00:01:20.081 --> 00:01:23.310
with hydrogens to make the three
XH_3 bonds.

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.415
But boron then has no leftover
electrons, carbon has one and

00:01:28.415 --> 00:01:30.060
nitrogen has two.
 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.203
So we want to see what the
implications of this are going

00:01:34.203 --> 00:01:38.050
to be for the structure and
dynamic behavior of these

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.507
molecules,
and then we'll check it against

00:01:40.507 --> 00:01:40.900
reality.
 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.515
First we need to look at
something that shows that the

00:01:45.515 --> 00:01:50.739
hybridization that you use to
make bonds should be related to

00:01:50.739 --> 00:01:51.959
structure.
 

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:54.530
Now suppose there is one of
these atoms that uses an

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.000
sp hybrid orbital,
that looks like that.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.599
You see the little dot where
the nucleus is.

00:01:59.599 --> 00:02:04.989
And suppose it happens also to
use some other hybrid orbital to

00:02:04.989 --> 00:02:06.730
make another bond.
 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:09.997
Now, you want to have,
because of the Pauli Principle

00:02:09.997 --> 00:02:10.986
--
and I'm sorry,

00:02:10.986 --> 00:02:13.199
we don't have time to go into
this now --

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:18.938
the orbitals that you're using
must not overlap one another.

00:02:18.938 --> 00:02:22.870
Because if there's net overlap
between two orbitals then --

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.889
and you have electrons in both
of them --

00:02:24.889 --> 00:02:26.908
those electrons are,
to a certain extent,

00:02:26.908 --> 00:02:30.729
the same thing,
if the orbitals overlap.

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:33.508
If they don't overlap,
then they're independent.

00:02:33.508 --> 00:02:37.704
So to have only two electrons
per orbital, the orbitals must

00:02:37.704 --> 00:02:38.699
not overlap.
 

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:42.322
So we can use that as a
criterion to say something about

00:02:42.322 --> 00:02:45.878
what other orbitals could be
used at certain angles.

00:02:45.878 --> 00:02:48.441
For example,
suppose the other hybrid

00:02:48.441 --> 00:02:52.068
orbital that this atom was using
was sp^3.

00:02:52.068 --> 00:02:55.145
Now you'll notice that --
remember -- let's suppose the

00:02:55.145 --> 00:02:58.679
green and the blue are positive,
and the red and the yellow are

00:02:58.679 --> 00:02:59.419
negative.
 

00:02:59.419 --> 00:03:01.479
Now how much overlap is there?
 

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:05.203
Well there'll be positive
overlap where green overlaps

00:03:05.203 --> 00:03:09.137
blue, and there'll be positive
overlap where red overlaps

00:03:09.137 --> 00:03:09.908
yellow.
 

00:03:09.908 --> 00:03:14.299
But there'll be negative
overlap where green overlaps

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:19.365
red, or where yellow overlaps --
no, where blue overlaps red,

00:03:19.365 --> 00:03:22.319
or where green overlaps yellow.
 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:25.378
Okay? Is that right?
 

00:03:25.378 --> 00:03:29.360
Yeah, where blue overlaps red,
or green overlaps yellow;

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.430
that'll be negative.
 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.083
And this, there'll be some
angle at which those things

00:03:34.083 --> 00:03:37.185
exactly cancel out and you get
no net overlap,

00:03:37.185 --> 00:03:38.840
no overlap integral.
 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.169
And we're interested in knowing
what that angle would be;

00:03:42.169 --> 00:03:45.998
that is, how should
hybridization be related to

00:03:45.998 --> 00:03:48.830
angles, be related to structure?
 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:52.500
Well, so the question is,
what's that angle?

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.067
And there's a nice formula,
that isn't too hard to work

00:03:55.067 --> 00:03:57.351
out,
why it should be that way,

00:03:57.351 --> 00:04:00.580
that relates sp^m and
sp^n,

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:03.119
the values m and
n, to the angle that

00:04:03.119 --> 00:04:06.770
should be between them,
in order to have no overlap.

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:10.210
So let's use that formula and
look at several mn's,

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:11.718
and what the angles is.
 

00:04:11.718 --> 00:04:13.830
Let's look at sp with
sp;

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:17.569
sp^2 with sp^2;
sp^3, sp^3;

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:22.790
and sp-anything with
sp^infinity.

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:26.439
What's sp^infinity?
 

00:04:26.439 --> 00:04:30.550
That says the ratio of p
to s is infinite.

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:31.540
So it's a pure p.
 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:35.547
So what angle would be pure
p orbital make with any

00:04:35.547 --> 00:04:36.180
hybrid?
 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:37.670
Okay, so those are the things
we're going to talk about.

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:38.970
So first let's try the first
one.

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:41.720
You can do the math for me.
 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.600
Okay, so it's sp^1,
sp^1;

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.600
m and n are one.
 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.983
So the denominator's the
√1,

00:04:48.983 --> 00:04:49.759
that's one.
 

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:52.620
The cosine of the angle is
minus one.

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:57.319
What's the angle?
 

00:04:57.319 --> 00:04:59.769
What angle has a cosine of
minus one?

00:04:59.769 --> 00:05:00.610
Student:  180.
 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:01.370
Prof: 180.
 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:02.089
Okay, good.
 

00:05:02.089 --> 00:05:03.160
So that would be linear.
 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:04.528
And you knew that,
I bet, already.

00:05:04.528 --> 00:05:06.639
Didn't they teach you that in
AP Chemistry,

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:08.778
that if you have two sp
orbitals,

00:05:08.778 --> 00:05:11.661
they're linear,
or if you have bonds that point

00:05:11.661 --> 00:05:15.170
opposite direction you use
sp hybrids for them.

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:17.709
If they didn't,
that's true anyhow.

00:05:17.709 --> 00:05:18.610
Okay?
 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:21.778
Now how about sp^2,
sp^2?

00:05:21.778 --> 00:05:24.050
So we're going to have m
and n are both two;

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:26.290
√4 is two.
 

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:30.009
So it's the angle whose cosine
is minus one half.

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:36.870
Anybody know what that is?
 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:38.259
I don't -- pardon me?
 

00:05:38.259 --> 00:05:39.029
Sixty?
 

00:05:39.029 --> 00:05:41.589
That's +½.
 

00:05:41.589 --> 00:05:45.656
It's 120, to be -½;
it has to be greater than

00:05:45.656 --> 00:05:47.079
ninety to be negative.
 

00:05:47.079 --> 00:05:49.639
So that's going to be
120º, and that's trigonal.

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:52.940
So sp^2 hybrids make an
angle of 120º.

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:55.870
Now how about sp^3
hybrids?

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:59.690
That's √9;
so minus a third.

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:02.247
That one probably isn't stored
in your head,

00:06:02.247 --> 00:06:04.149
but it's an interesting angle.
 

00:06:04.149 --> 00:06:07.211
It's 109.5º,
which is the angle in a

00:06:07.211 --> 00:06:08.129
tetrahedron.
 

00:06:08.129 --> 00:06:08.819
Right?
 

00:06:08.819 --> 00:06:12.663
So that methane,
which makes sp^3 bonds

00:06:12.663 --> 00:06:15.822
at the carbon,
has tetrahedral angles,

00:06:15.822 --> 00:06:17.189
109.5º.
 

00:06:17.189 --> 00:06:19.709
Now, how about
sp-anything,

00:06:19.709 --> 00:06:21.620
with n=infinity?
 

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:23.149
What's the denominator?
 

00:06:23.149 --> 00:06:25.379
Students:  Infinity.
 

00:06:25.379 --> 00:06:26.620
Prof: It's infinity.
 

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:31.980
So what's the angle whose
cosine is…

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:38.310
Student:  90º
Prof: Okay,

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:39.230
90º.
 

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:40.050
Right?
 

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:44.389
So that means -- that is what
makes things σ and

00:06:44.389 --> 00:06:45.257
π.
 

00:06:45.257 --> 00:06:45.910
Right?
 

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:48.447
A p orbital,
with any other hybrid,

00:06:48.447 --> 00:06:50.430
has to be perpendicular to it.
 

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:52.194
So you won't -- that's what we
talked about,

00:06:52.194 --> 00:06:54.000
σ and π,
last time.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.617
So the p orbital is
π, and it's

00:06:56.617 --> 00:07:00.610
perpendicular to anything else,
90º, no matter what other

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:01.329
hybrid.
 

00:07:01.329 --> 00:07:05.057
Okay, so now how about this
particular one we have here

00:07:05.057 --> 00:07:07.889
where it's sp^3 and
sp^1?

00:07:07.889 --> 00:07:11.079
That turns out to 125.3º.
 

00:07:11.079 --> 00:07:15.406
So that's what the angle should
be, if the carbon were making

00:07:15.406 --> 00:07:18.867
one bond with sp and one
with sp^3.

00:07:18.867 --> 00:07:19.589
Right?
 

00:07:19.589 --> 00:07:23.339
But the important thing here is
that's there's a relationship

00:07:23.339 --> 00:07:26.903
between hybridization of two
orbitals on the same atom and

00:07:26.903 --> 00:07:29.529
what the angle should be between
them.

00:07:29.529 --> 00:07:30.480
Yes, Angela?
 

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:34.223
Student:  When would you
have an sp^3 and an

00:07:34.223 --> 00:07:36.720
sp hybrid;
like be at angles?

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:39.745
Prof: Well we're going
to have to decide what

00:07:39.745 --> 00:07:41.466
determines the hybridization.
 

00:07:41.466 --> 00:07:42.000
Right?
 

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.333
And it could be different for
two bonds from the same atom,

00:07:45.333 --> 00:07:47.230
and we'll see examples of that.
 

00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:50.529
So that will become answered
soon.

00:07:50.529 --> 00:07:53.314
It's if they're bonding to
different kinds of things,

00:07:53.314 --> 00:07:55.509
they may have different
hybridizations;

00:07:55.509 --> 00:07:58.569
and we'll see an example of
that, several examples.

00:07:58.569 --> 00:08:01.757
So we want to optimize the
hybridization,

00:08:01.757 --> 00:08:04.230
that is to get -- yes,
Lucas?

00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:08.470
Student:  Does different
weightings of the hybridized

00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:11.129
orbitals change the angle,
degrees?

00:08:11.129 --> 00:08:12.300
Prof: Yes,
there are two ways.

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:16.500
You could change the angle by
moving the nuclei around,

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:19.160
for some other reason,
whatever it is,

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:22.648
and that would then change the
hybridization of the carbon

00:08:22.648 --> 00:08:24.240
that's making the bonds.
 

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:25.910
So it works both ways.
 

00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:27.144
If you change the
hybridization,

00:08:27.144 --> 00:08:29.610
you change the angle;
if you change the angle,

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:31.550
you change the hybridization.
 

00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:35.039
Okay, now we want to optimize
hybridization.

00:08:35.039 --> 00:08:36.730
What do mean, optimize?
 

00:08:36.730 --> 00:08:39.149
We mean we want to get the
lowest possible energy.

00:08:39.149 --> 00:08:42.779
We want to choose the
hybridization that'll give the

00:08:42.779 --> 00:08:46.193
lowest hybridization ,
and therefore a particular

00:08:46.193 --> 00:08:48.970
geometry, for XH^3,
certain angles.

00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:50.350
Okay, now let's think about
that.

00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:55.298
We're going to have one of the
valence electrons of the X atom

00:08:55.298 --> 00:08:58.870
in each of three bonding atomic
orbitals,

00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:02.164
bonding to the hydrogen,
and whatever's left over goes

00:09:02.164 --> 00:09:06.462
into the fourth atomic orbital,
and we want to minimize the

00:09:06.462 --> 00:09:07.110
energy.
 

00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:08.168
Okay?
 

00:09:08.168 --> 00:09:12.240
Now let's first look at it from
the point of view of the bonds.

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:15.058
We want to make the strongest
possible bonds.

00:09:15.058 --> 00:09:18.548
We want to maximize the overlap
in the bonds.

00:09:18.548 --> 00:09:20.789
What hybrid gives the best
overlap?

00:09:20.789 --> 00:09:23.009
sp.
 

00:09:23.009 --> 00:09:29.163
But we have to make three bonds;
sp you can only make two

00:09:29.163 --> 00:09:29.620
bonds.
 

00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:33.429
So what's the best you can use
if you want to make three bonds?

00:09:33.429 --> 00:09:34.250
Student:  sp^2.
 

00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:35.058
Prof: sp^2^(.
 

00:09:35.058 --> 00:09:39.096
)So no matter whether it's
BH_3, CH_3_ or NH_3,

00:09:39.096 --> 00:09:42.773
all of them will overlap best
in making three bonds,

00:09:42.773 --> 00:09:45.080
if you use sp^2_.
 

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:50.149
So the bonds cry out,
"Use sp^2";

00:09:50.149 --> 00:09:53.629
that'll maximize the overlap
and minimize the energy of the

00:09:53.629 --> 00:09:55.129
electrons in the bonds.
 

00:09:55.129 --> 00:09:56.308
Okay?
 

00:09:56.308 --> 00:10:00.916
But that's not the only game in
town, because there's also the

00:10:00.916 --> 00:10:04.918
other electron that's on the
atom, if there is another

00:10:04.918 --> 00:10:05.899
electron.
 

00:10:05.899 --> 00:10:06.428
Okay?
 

00:10:06.428 --> 00:10:09.774
Because carbon has one and
nitrogen has two other

00:10:09.774 --> 00:10:10.610
electrons.
 

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:12.808
So they should get a say in it
too.

00:10:12.808 --> 00:10:15.500
So the X atom,
which has to accommodate

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:18.788
whatever's left over,
says, "Okay, go ahead,

00:10:18.788 --> 00:10:22.057
make three bonds,
but get the lowest energy for

00:10:22.057 --> 00:10:25.452
the other electron,
that I'm the only one

00:10:25.452 --> 00:10:27.370
responsible for."
 

00:10:27.370 --> 00:10:28.070
Right?
 

00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:31.653
So what's the lowest energy you
could make for a pair of

00:10:31.653 --> 00:10:34.129
electrons, or for a single
electron;

00:10:34.129 --> 00:10:36.909
what's the lowest energy
valence orbital?

00:10:36.909 --> 00:10:37.460
Students:  s.
 

00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:38.863
Prof: s.
 

00:10:38.863 --> 00:10:41.669
So the atom says,
"Okay, make your three

00:10:41.669 --> 00:10:45.051
bonds, but make sure you don't
let s orbital go

00:10:45.051 --> 00:10:45.943
begging."
 

00:10:45.943 --> 00:10:46.710
Right?
 

00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:50.523
Use the maximum you can of s
orbital, because otherwise

00:10:50.523 --> 00:10:54.461
you're using high-energy atomic
orbitals when you might not need

00:10:54.461 --> 00:10:54.899
to.
 

00:10:54.899 --> 00:10:59.105
Now sometimes these would agree
and sometimes they would fight

00:10:59.105 --> 00:11:02.070
with one another,
the bonds and the atom.

00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:02.678
Okay?
 

00:11:02.678 --> 00:11:05.914
So from the point of view of
the atom, boron,

00:11:05.914 --> 00:11:09.664
with only three valence
electrons, all being used in

00:11:09.664 --> 00:11:12.460
bonds, doesn't have anything
else.

00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:16.125
So it would certainly want to
use three sp^2 and leave

00:11:16.125 --> 00:11:17.960
the p orbital vacant.
 

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:22.658
That gets the maximum utility
out of the s;

00:11:22.658 --> 00:11:25.629
puts the s where the
electrons are.

00:11:25.629 --> 00:11:28.379
So that's what boron says,
use three sp^2's,

00:11:28.379 --> 00:11:29.259
for the bonds.
 

00:11:29.259 --> 00:11:33.577
What does carbon say -- no,
pardon me, what does nitrogen

00:11:33.577 --> 00:11:34.038
say?
 

00:11:34.038 --> 00:11:37.149
Nitrogen, if it wanted to be
the best atom,

00:11:37.149 --> 00:11:40.230
would put two electrons,
the unshared pair,

00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:44.090
into the s orbital,
and one into each of the

00:11:44.090 --> 00:11:46.636
remaining three p
orbitals.

00:11:46.636 --> 00:11:47.408
Right?
 

00:11:47.408 --> 00:11:49.860
That gets the maximum use of
out of s.

00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:53.900
You don't want to waste s
by putting it where there's

00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:56.710
only one electron on the
nitrogen atom.

00:11:56.710 --> 00:11:59.908
You want to use it where there
are two electrons.

00:11:59.908 --> 00:12:01.440
Okay, so nitrogen says,
"Well,

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:04.860
I'd prefer to use three p
orbitals to make my bonds,

00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:08.490
and put two electrons into the
s orbital."

00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:09.070
Okay?
 

00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:11.129
Now, what does carbon say?
 

00:12:11.129 --> 00:12:13.967
Carbon says,
"Look, I got four

00:12:13.967 --> 00:12:16.467
electrons;
three of them are going to be

00:12:16.467 --> 00:12:19.259
in some kind of hybrid,
that's going to make the bonds,

00:12:19.259 --> 00:12:21.740
and one of them's going to be
something else.

00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:23.679
But if I take the s out
of one place,

00:12:23.679 --> 00:12:25.528
I'm going to put it into the
other one.

00:12:25.528 --> 00:12:27.561
Over all the four,
I'm going to use up all the

00:12:27.561 --> 00:12:28.509
s character.
 

00:12:28.509 --> 00:12:30.129
There's one electron in each of
them.

00:12:30.129 --> 00:12:32.080
Who cares?" Right?
 

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:35.940
So carbon really doesn't care,
from the point of view of the

00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:38.230
carbon atom, about
hybridization.

00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:43.529
It'll care for making -- for
the bonds, but it doesn't care

00:12:43.529 --> 00:12:46.090
for the unshared electron.
 

00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:49.508
Okay, but now we have to
reconcile these two

00:12:49.508 --> 00:12:50.860
considerations.
 

00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:59.518
So the boron will make the best
bonds if it uses sp^2 and

00:12:59.518 --> 00:13:06.389
it'll make the best atom if it
uses sp^2.

00:13:06.389 --> 00:13:08.220
So great, they agree.
 

00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:12.322
So boron should really want to
use sp^2 hybrids for its

00:13:12.322 --> 00:13:12.860
bonds.
 

00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:16.048
Remember, those are the ones
that form 120º.

00:13:16.048 --> 00:13:19.320
So it'll be the pattern of a
Mercedes star.

00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:20.870
Yes, Yoonjoo?
 

00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:23.653
Student:  Can you
explain again why we use three

00:13:23.653 --> 00:13:26.129
p instead of like,
the hybrid orbitals for

00:13:26.129 --> 00:13:26.798
nitrogen?
 

00:13:26.798 --> 00:13:29.610
Prof: If you're just
looking at a nitrogen atom,

00:13:29.610 --> 00:13:32.570
it's going to have two
electrons in one of its

00:13:32.570 --> 00:13:36.072
orbitals,
and one in each of three other

00:13:36.072 --> 00:13:36.885
orbitals.
 

00:13:36.885 --> 00:13:37.610
Right?
 

00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:41.001
So those two electrons,
that orbital that holds two

00:13:41.001 --> 00:13:44.529
electrons, should be as low as
possible in energy;

00:13:44.529 --> 00:13:46.100
and that's s.
 

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:49.110
So put two in s and one in each
of the three p's,

00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:51.610
and that'll give the lowest
energy atom,

00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:53.870
with one electron in each of
the four orbitals --

00:13:53.870 --> 00:13:59.190
pardon me, with two in one and
three in the other three;

00:13:59.190 --> 00:14:00.850
one in each of the other three.
 

00:14:00.850 --> 00:14:02.620
Okay?
 

00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:05.208
Okay, so but anyhow,
with BH_3_ they

00:14:05.208 --> 00:14:08.604
agree, from both points of view:
the strongest bonds and the

00:14:08.604 --> 00:14:09.408
best atom.
 

00:14:09.408 --> 00:14:12.621
So it'll certainly want to be
flat, and 120º

00:14:12.621 --> 00:14:13.559
bond angles.
 

00:14:13.559 --> 00:14:17.019
Now how about CH_3?
 

00:14:17.019 --> 00:14:21.428
CH_3, from the point of view of
the bonds, wants to be

00:14:21.428 --> 00:14:24.840
sp^2, and the atom
doesn't care.

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:28.202
So fine, be sp^2,
be flat, be planar,

00:14:28.202 --> 00:14:30.470
with 120º
bond angles.

00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:33.509
But it won't care quite as much
as boron does.

00:14:33.509 --> 00:14:40.580
So carbon says it'll prefer to
be planar, but not as strongly;

00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:46.019
so it'll be easier to bend it,
because it doesn't have this

00:14:46.019 --> 00:14:50.990
consideration of leaving a p
orbital vacant.

00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:51.529
Okay?
 

00:14:51.529 --> 00:14:52.769
And now about nitrogen?
 

00:14:52.769 --> 00:14:55.428
Now you got a fight on your
hands -- right?

00:14:55.428 --> 00:14:59.203
-- because the bonds want to be
flat and 120º

00:14:59.203 --> 00:15:01.648
bond angles,
but the atom wants to use

00:15:01.648 --> 00:15:05.120
p orbitals,
90º angles for the bonds;

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:07.960
so like the corner of a cube
would be the nitrogen,

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:10.798
the bonds would be going out at
90º angles.

00:15:10.798 --> 00:15:14.529
So here there's going to have
to be some compromise.

00:15:14.529 --> 00:15:15.330
Okay?
 

00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:19.659
So NH_3, since it must
compromise, won't be either

00:15:19.659 --> 00:15:24.078
perfectly flat or 90º
angles, but something in

00:15:24.078 --> 00:15:25.139
between.
 

00:15:25.139 --> 00:15:27.350
It'll be pyramidal.
 

00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:29.610
Okay?
 

00:15:29.610 --> 00:15:34.500
Now are the predictions clear;
and the reason for them?

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:37.678
Yoonjoo, do you see now,
why it's the way it is?

00:15:37.678 --> 00:15:42.509
Don't let me bully you into it,
if you don't really understand.

00:15:42.509 --> 00:15:43.408
Dana?
 

00:15:43.408 --> 00:15:45.673
Student:  Can you
explain the difference in what

00:15:45.673 --> 00:15:47.769
the atoms and the bonds want for
nitrogen again?

00:15:47.769 --> 00:15:49.700
Prof: Yes,
what we want to do is get the

00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:50.750
lowest possible energy.
 

00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:54.340
The lowest energy for the bonds
will be the best overlap.

00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:55.850
You're making three bonds.
 

00:15:55.850 --> 00:15:58.356
So sp^2 will give the
lowest energy,

00:15:58.356 --> 00:15:59.850
as far as the bonds go.
 

00:15:59.850 --> 00:16:03.866
But there also might be -- and
that's the only game in town for

00:16:03.866 --> 00:16:04.255
boron.
 

00:16:04.255 --> 00:16:04.840
Right?
 

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:07.515
But in carbon you have another
electron you have to

00:16:07.515 --> 00:16:09.761
accommodate,
and there's a question of what

00:16:09.761 --> 00:16:12.073
energy it will have,
even though it's not being

00:16:12.073 --> 00:16:12.460
shared.
 

00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:15.908
And in nitrogen there are two
of those other electrons.

00:16:15.908 --> 00:16:19.650
Now, the best orbital of an
atom, for an electron to be in,

00:16:19.650 --> 00:16:21.778
the lowest energy,
is s.

00:16:21.778 --> 00:16:25.178
And in nitrogen there are going
to be two electrons that want to

00:16:25.178 --> 00:16:26.690
be in an s orbital.
 

00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:28.638
If they do that,
they use up the s

00:16:28.638 --> 00:16:31.938
orbital, and the only thing
you have left over to make the

00:16:31.938 --> 00:16:33.779
bonds is the p orbital.
 

00:16:33.779 --> 00:16:35.740
So now you've got a fight on
your hands.

00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:38.962
Are you going to have sharp
angles and have the unshared

00:16:38.962 --> 00:16:41.553
pair in a low-energy,
s orbital but weak

00:16:41.553 --> 00:16:43.779
bonds, or are you going to have
strong bonds,

00:16:43.779 --> 00:16:46.363
sp^2,
but put the unpaired electrons

00:16:46.363 --> 00:16:47.840
in a p orbital?
 

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:51.783
Okay, Kevin,
did you have a question or did

00:16:51.783 --> 00:16:53.379
that answer it?
 

00:16:53.379 --> 00:16:53.820
Okay.
 

00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:55.460
Yes?
 

00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:56.190
I can't hear very well.
 

00:16:56.190 --> 00:16:58.812
Student:  Is there such
a thing as an sp^3

00:16:58.812 --> 00:16:59.288
orbital?
 

00:16:59.288 --> 00:17:00.416
Prof: Yes.
 

00:17:00.416 --> 00:17:02.470
What does sp^3^( )mean?
 

00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:05.561
It means a hybrid orbital,
a mixture of s and

00:17:05.561 --> 00:17:09.079
p, with three times as
much p as s.

00:17:09.079 --> 00:17:11.029
Okay?
 

00:17:11.029 --> 00:17:12.318
You could have that.
 

00:17:12.318 --> 00:17:15.803
You could have three
sp^3 bonds,

00:17:15.803 --> 00:17:18.095
for nitrogen,
for example,

00:17:18.095 --> 00:17:23.318
and then an sp^3 hybrid,
in which the unshared pair

00:17:23.318 --> 00:17:24.420
lives.
 

00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:24.890
Okay?
 

00:17:24.890 --> 00:17:26.460
That would be a possibility,
sure.

00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:28.740
And that's the kind of thing
I'm talking about here,

00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:31.160
by saying it would be
intermediate,

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:35.837
between being 90º
bond angles and 120º

00:17:35.837 --> 00:17:37.829
bond angles,
flat.

00:17:37.829 --> 00:17:39.490
Any more questions?
 

00:17:39.490 --> 00:17:40.480
Yes?
 

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:42.806
Student:  Why are we
concerned about the atomic

00:17:42.806 --> 00:17:44.650
orbitals rather than molecular
orbitals?

00:17:44.650 --> 00:17:47.380
Prof: Ah,
I'm going to get to that just

00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:48.288
shortly here.
 

00:17:48.288 --> 00:17:51.809
So, because we're talking about
bonds.

00:17:51.809 --> 00:17:54.098
Bonds are local.
 

00:17:54.098 --> 00:17:57.068
Bonds don't go over the whole
molecule.

00:17:57.068 --> 00:17:59.759
Molecular orbitals go over the
whole molecule.

00:17:59.759 --> 00:18:01.950
And we've been talking thus
far, mostly,

00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:06.284
in terms of molecular orbitals,
but now we're shifting to talk

00:18:06.284 --> 00:18:08.727
about bonds,
because what we wanted to do

00:18:08.727 --> 00:18:09.808
was talk about bonds.
 

00:18:09.808 --> 00:18:12.740
And I'll do a little about the
philosophy of that shortly.

00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:13.710
Okay?
 

00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:15.588
So here are the predictions.
 

00:18:15.588 --> 00:18:19.630
BH_3 should strongly want to be
planar and be hard to bend.

00:18:19.630 --> 00:18:22.390
CH_3 should want to be planar
but be easy to bend.

00:18:22.390 --> 00:18:25.876
And NH_3_ should be
easy to distort out of plane,

00:18:25.876 --> 00:18:29.357
so that it's not flat;
in fact, not only should it be

00:18:29.357 --> 00:18:32.482
easy to distort,
it should prefer to distort in

00:18:32.482 --> 00:18:34.250
its lowest energy form.
 

00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:37.538
Okay, so now let's see if
that's true.

00:18:37.538 --> 00:18:41.621
Is it true that that unshared
pair will compete for s

00:18:41.621 --> 00:18:45.150
character, and therefore make
nitrogen pyramidal?

00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:46.420
Now, how do we know?
 

00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:50.508
There's our prediction:
distortion from the plane will

00:18:50.508 --> 00:18:55.599
weaken the bond and deprive the
electrons of s character;

00:18:55.599 --> 00:18:57.920
so it doesn't want to bend.
 

00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:00.920
Here, distortion from the plane
weakens the bonds,

00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:05.240
but it shifts s
character to the lone electron,

00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:08.842
where at least it's not wasted,
because there is at least an

00:19:08.842 --> 00:19:09.880
electron there.
 

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:12.307
And in NH_3,
it weakens the bonds but it

00:19:12.307 --> 00:19:15.978
shifts s character from
single electrons to a pair of

00:19:15.978 --> 00:19:19.259
electrons;
which is something good.

00:19:19.259 --> 00:19:21.829
Okay, so are these predictions
true?

00:19:21.829 --> 00:19:23.318
Well, we need experiment.
 

00:19:23.318 --> 00:19:29.544
How about X-ray for seeing the
structure of BH_3,

00:19:29.544 --> 00:19:31.230
CH_3, NH_3?
 

00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:32.289
How about NH_3?
 

00:19:32.289 --> 00:19:34.690
Have you ever seen NH_3?
 

00:19:34.690 --> 00:19:37.009
Have you ever smelled NH_3?
 

00:19:37.009 --> 00:19:37.940
It's ammonia.
 

00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:39.859
So how about doing X-ray on it?
 

00:19:39.859 --> 00:19:40.589
Student:  No.
 

00:19:40.589 --> 00:19:42.009
Prof: Why not? Shai?
 

00:19:42.009 --> 00:19:44.144
Student:  Because you
can only use X-ray to see

00:19:44.144 --> 00:19:45.366
electrons --
Prof: Can't hear very

00:19:45.366 --> 00:19:45.500
well.
 

00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:47.088
Student:  You can only
use X-ray to see electrons;

00:19:47.088 --> 00:19:48.650
those are the ones that are
going to move when you ---

00:19:48.650 --> 00:19:51.220
Prof: No,
that's not the main problem.

00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:51.788
Yes?
 

00:19:51.788 --> 00:19:53.048
Student:  You can't make
it a crystal.

00:19:53.048 --> 00:19:55.555
Prof: You have to have a
crystal to do X-ray

00:19:55.555 --> 00:19:57.410
crystallography,
and NH_3 is a gas.

00:19:57.410 --> 00:19:59.915
Now you might say,
okay, we'll cool it way down to

00:19:59.915 --> 00:20:03.140
liquid nitrogen temperature and
then maybe it'll crystallize.

00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:05.480
It'll be difficult to grow a
crystal of ammonia,

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:08.321
but it's conceivable we might
be able to grow a crystal of

00:20:08.321 --> 00:20:08.920
ammonia.
 

00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:09.828
Okay?
 

00:20:09.828 --> 00:20:14.259
Can we use the same trick for
CH_3 and BH_3?

00:20:14.259 --> 00:20:15.599
That one's a gas.
 

00:20:15.599 --> 00:20:16.250
Okay?
 

00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:20.077
CH_3, unfortunately,
if you get two of them together

00:20:20.077 --> 00:20:22.180
they react, to get C_2H_6.
 

00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:25.976
So you're never going to be
able to cool them down and get a

00:20:25.976 --> 00:20:26.618
crystal.
 

00:20:26.618 --> 00:20:27.609
And the same thing is true of
BH_3.

00:20:27.609 --> 00:20:29.670
It forms B_2H_6.
 

00:20:29.670 --> 00:20:30.569
Right?
 

00:20:30.569 --> 00:20:31.960
So forget crystals for this.
 

00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:33.943
We can't use X-ray
crystallography,

00:20:33.943 --> 00:20:36.568
the technique we've used so far
to do this.

00:20:36.568 --> 00:20:38.650
But there are other techniques
for finding structure,

00:20:38.650 --> 00:20:40.328
and the one we're going to talk
about --

00:20:40.328 --> 00:20:41.990
actually we're going to talk
about two --

00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:44.640
but we're going to talk about,
not X-ray,

00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:48.185
we're going to talk about IR --
we're going to talk about

00:20:48.185 --> 00:20:51.286
spectroscopy,
infrared spectroscopy,

00:20:51.286 --> 00:20:55.269
and electron spin resonance
spectroscopy.

00:20:55.269 --> 00:20:56.150
Okay?
 

00:20:56.150 --> 00:20:59.253
We're going to talk more about
infrared spectroscopy next

00:20:59.253 --> 00:21:02.200
semester,
but I'll show you just enough

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:06.759
to get through the question that
we're interested in now;

00:21:06.759 --> 00:21:10.075
Does that remind you of
anything that moves like in a

00:21:10.075 --> 00:21:10.839
high wind?
 

00:21:10.839 --> 00:21:13.700
Student: A weathervane.
 

00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:15.450
Prof: It's like an
umbrella, right?

00:21:15.450 --> 00:21:18.440
In a high wind it blows inside
out.

00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:23.103
Okay, so this is sometimes
called the "umbrella"

00:21:23.103 --> 00:21:24.740
vibration of XH_3.
 

00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:28.253
And you can treat it with
Erwin Meets Goldilocks,

00:21:28.253 --> 00:21:32.400
as if it's one-dimension;
just how much motion of all

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:35.088
these atoms, how much motion.
 

00:21:35.088 --> 00:21:37.140
You know what the masses of the
atoms are.

00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:39.259
You know the kind of motion
you're interested in.

00:21:39.259 --> 00:21:40.920
It's all coordinated.
 

00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:43.490
So you're changing really just
one-dimension,

00:21:43.490 --> 00:21:47.115
in moving all these things in a
coordinated way back and forth.

00:21:47.115 --> 00:21:47.700
Right?
 

00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:51.635
So you can treat it as an Erwin
problem, with a fictitious mass

00:21:51.635 --> 00:21:55.000
that reflects the amount of
motion of each of the four

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.160
atoms, while that's happening.
 

00:21:57.160 --> 00:22:02.118
Okay, so here's BH_3 doing that
out-of-plane-bending vibration,

00:22:02.118 --> 00:22:06.278
the umbrella vibration,
and CH_3 doing the same thing

00:22:06.278 --> 00:22:08.038
with its electron.
 

00:22:08.038 --> 00:22:16.598
Now, it turns out that BH_3
vibrates 34-trillion times a

00:22:16.598 --> 00:22:18.000
second.
 

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:18.818
Okay?
 

00:22:18.818 --> 00:22:22.980
And that's called 34.2
terahertz;

00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:25.190
that's how often it vibrates.
 

00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:34.079
CH_3 vibrates 18.7 terahertz;
so only half as fast as BH_3.

00:22:34.079 --> 00:22:35.410
Does this make sense?
 

00:22:35.410 --> 00:22:40.415
Suppose the springs that you're
bending when you do this

00:22:40.415 --> 00:22:45.513
vibration -- suppose it's
springs -- which set of springs

00:22:45.513 --> 00:22:46.880
is stiffer?
 

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:51.066
The BH_3 or the -- does a stiff
spring make a vibration faster

00:22:51.066 --> 00:22:51.890
or slower?
 

00:22:51.890 --> 00:22:52.680
Student:  Faster.
 

00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:53.868
Prof: Faster.
 

00:22:53.868 --> 00:22:57.730
So it says the springs are
stiffer in BH_3.

00:22:57.730 --> 00:23:02.703
It prefers to be planar more
strongly than CH_3 does.

00:23:02.703 --> 00:23:03.470
Right?
 

00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:07.167
Now, you might ask -- what
might you ask at this stage,

00:23:07.167 --> 00:23:10.250
when I tell you that it
vibrates that fast?

00:23:10.250 --> 00:23:12.220
&lt;&lt;Students speak over one
another&gt;&gt;

00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:13.588
Prof: No,
that's not the question I want.

00:23:13.588 --> 00:23:15.650
Student:  How can you
tell?

00:23:15.650 --> 00:23:17.328
Prof: How do you know?
 

00:23:17.328 --> 00:23:21.548
How do I know that it vibrates
at that frequency?

00:23:21.548 --> 00:23:24.750
Well, so it would be a stiffer
spring, but how do I know?

00:23:24.750 --> 00:23:28.696
Well, when it vibrates,
the electric charge is moving

00:23:28.696 --> 00:23:29.836
back and forth.
 

00:23:29.836 --> 00:23:30.519
Right?
 

00:23:30.519 --> 00:23:33.780
So the direction of the --
there's a dipole there,

00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:36.308
+/-, and it's moving back and
forth.

00:23:36.308 --> 00:23:40.690
And what does that create,
when you have charges moving

00:23:40.690 --> 00:23:42.068
back and forth?
 

00:23:42.068 --> 00:23:43.865
Electromagnetic radiation.
 

00:23:43.865 --> 00:23:44.348
Right?
 

00:23:44.348 --> 00:23:48.194
So electromagnetic radiation is
going to come out,

00:23:48.194 --> 00:23:51.019
as this thing vibrates,
like that.

00:23:51.019 --> 00:23:56.474
And it comes out with a shorter
wavelength for BH_3 than for

00:23:56.474 --> 00:23:56.936
CH_3.
 

00:23:56.936 --> 00:23:57.769
Right?
 

00:23:57.769 --> 00:24:03.202
And it turns out that the
wavelength is such that for BH_3

00:24:03.202 --> 00:24:08.160
there are 1100 vibrations,
waves, in a centimeter;

00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:09.509
short wavelengths.
 

00:24:09.509 --> 00:24:14.603
And it's longer wavelengths,
only 600 waves in a centimeter

00:24:14.603 --> 00:24:15.568
for CH_3.
 

00:24:15.568 --> 00:24:20.080
Now, we can also -- so
different light would come out,

00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:22.720
infrared light,
of these two;

00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:25.634
or different colors of light,
infrared light,

00:24:25.634 --> 00:24:26.630
get absorbed.
 

00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:28.358
That's how you actually measure
it.

00:24:28.358 --> 00:24:31.842
And remember,
the frequency of light has to

00:24:31.842 --> 00:24:34.910
do with the energies of the
photon.

00:24:34.910 --> 00:24:38.291
So in, if you take the quantum
mechanical view that you go from

00:24:38.291 --> 00:24:41.019
one quantized state to another
quantized state,

00:24:41.019 --> 00:24:44.430
when you absorb,
or emit, light,

00:24:44.430 --> 00:24:47.801
then we know,
from this frequency,

00:24:47.801 --> 00:24:52.799
that in one case the two energy
levels you're talking about are

00:24:52.799 --> 00:24:57.858
separated by 3.26 kcal/mole,
and in the other case by 1.73

00:24:57.858 --> 00:25:00.278
kcal/mole;
only about half as much.

00:25:00.278 --> 00:25:03.420
Is everybody on board with this
so far?

00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:06.755
So it's from the absorption of
infrared light that we know how

00:25:06.755 --> 00:25:09.214
fast they vibrate,
and therefore how stiff the

00:25:09.214 --> 00:25:10.089
springs are.
 

00:25:10.089 --> 00:25:11.599
Okay?
 

00:25:11.599 --> 00:25:13.470
Now just how stiff are they?
 

00:25:13.470 --> 00:25:15.930
Well we can use Erwin for this
point of view.

00:25:15.930 --> 00:25:18.732
We have the amount of
deformation, which is our

00:25:18.732 --> 00:25:21.515
one-dimension,
as it goes back and forth,

00:25:21.515 --> 00:25:25.410
and we can assume that it's
something like Hooke's Law --

00:25:25.410 --> 00:25:28.769
that's an assumption -- the
distortion,

00:25:28.769 --> 00:25:30.470
these springs.
 

00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:34.730
And then we can adjust the
potential, how sharp the

00:25:34.730 --> 00:25:38.905
parabola is, of potential
energy, until we get two

00:25:38.905 --> 00:25:42.230
energies that are spaced like
that.

00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:44.390
Does everybody see what we're
doing?

00:25:44.390 --> 00:25:45.160
So here we do it.
 

00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:48.790
On the left,
we get these lowest two energy

00:25:48.790 --> 00:25:53.980
levels and we -- there's the
parabola that does the trick.

00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:56.872
So that's a strong,
a stiff spring,

00:25:56.872 --> 00:25:59.170
strong planar preference.
 

00:25:59.170 --> 00:26:02.310
And in the case of CH_3,
to get that lower energy

00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:05.059
separation, you need a broader
parabola.

00:26:05.059 --> 00:26:07.529
It's easier to bend;
the springs are softer.

00:26:07.529 --> 00:26:09.359
Okay?
 

00:26:09.359 --> 00:26:12.950
Everybody see how that worked?
 

00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:17.324
Okay, so infrared spectroscopy
then tells us that first,

00:26:17.324 --> 00:26:21.935
that it prefers to be planar,
and second, that it's stiffer

00:26:21.935 --> 00:26:26.920
for boron than it is for carbon;
just as we predicted.

00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:27.670
Okay?
 

00:26:27.670 --> 00:26:31.730
Now how about for NH_3?
 

00:26:31.730 --> 00:26:36.571
For NH_3, you see two
absorptions in the infrared,

00:26:36.571 --> 00:26:40.130
and they're very near one
another;

00:26:40.130 --> 00:26:46.759
968 and 932 wavenumbers;
that is, waves per centimeter.

00:26:46.759 --> 00:26:49.558
If we translate that,
it means that there are two

00:26:49.558 --> 00:26:52.616
energy levels --
there's a low energy level --

00:26:52.616 --> 00:26:56.769
and then there are two that are
very close to one another,

00:26:56.769 --> 00:27:00.171
in order to have these two
different colors of infrared

00:27:00.171 --> 00:27:01.619
light being absorbed.
 

00:27:01.619 --> 00:27:02.868
How can we get this?
 

00:27:02.868 --> 00:27:05.950
How can we get -- this is not
Hooke's Law.

00:27:05.950 --> 00:27:08.056
Remember what happens with
Hooke's Law in the energy

00:27:08.056 --> 00:27:08.470
spacing?
 

00:27:08.470 --> 00:27:09.670
What happens?
 

00:27:09.670 --> 00:27:11.390
They're even.
 

00:27:11.390 --> 00:27:13.710
Remember?
 

00:27:13.710 --> 00:27:15.880
So this isn't anything like
Hooke's Law.

00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:19.119
Where do you get two that are
very similar to one another?

00:27:19.119 --> 00:27:20.440
Do you remember?
 

00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:21.579
Students:
 Double minimum.

00:27:21.579 --> 00:27:22.088
Prof: What?
 

00:27:22.088 --> 00:27:22.710
Students:
 Double minimum.

00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:24.640
Prof: A double minimum
gives that.

00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:28.835
So NH_3_ must be a
double minimum,

00:27:28.835 --> 00:27:29.810
like this.
 

00:27:29.810 --> 00:27:30.690
Right?
 

00:27:30.690 --> 00:27:35.011
And those must -- the blue and
the red one, must be the one

00:27:35.011 --> 00:27:38.440
with three nodes and the one
with two nodes.

00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:43.440
There's also one with zero
nodes, and one with one node.

00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:45.609
But those are both down at the
bottom.

00:27:45.609 --> 00:27:46.078
Right?
 

00:27:46.078 --> 00:27:48.865
They have the same energy,
because there's not enough

00:27:48.865 --> 00:27:51.114
overlap between the two to make
them split.

00:27:51.114 --> 00:27:51.650
Right?
 

00:27:51.650 --> 00:27:55.964
So the IR spectroscopy of
ammonia tells you it's a double

00:27:55.964 --> 00:27:59.587
minimum, and also,
in order to get that spacing,

00:27:59.587 --> 00:28:02.440
tells you how big the barrier
is.

00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:07.670
It costs three kcal/mole to
make NH_3 planar.

00:28:07.670 --> 00:28:11.170
It prefers to be pyramidal.
 

00:28:11.170 --> 00:28:12.048
Okay?
 

00:28:12.048 --> 00:28:14.271
And that splitting,
that "tunnel"

00:28:14.271 --> 00:28:16.535
splitting,
that we talked about before,

00:28:16.535 --> 00:28:20.558
for those two levels,
is thirty-seven wavenumbers.

00:28:20.558 --> 00:28:23.765
Remember, there's also the two
that are down at the bottom,

00:28:23.765 --> 00:28:26.638
with zero and one node,
and they're separated by only

00:28:26.638 --> 00:28:29.123
one wavenumber;
they're very close to one

00:28:29.123 --> 00:28:29.640
another.
 

00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:33.167
But we can translate that into
the tunneling frequency,

00:28:33.167 --> 00:28:36.240
when you're down in the lowest
energy levels.

00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:38.710
How fast does it go back and
forth?

00:28:38.710 --> 00:28:40.420
And you remember how to do that.
 

00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:45.818
If one wavenumber is two small
calories/mole,

00:28:45.818 --> 00:28:48.685
not kilocalories,
and we use that thing that we

00:28:48.685 --> 00:28:53.961
talked about in lecture nine,
about how to go from splitting

00:28:53.961 --> 00:28:57.958
to tunneling rate;
and it turns out that in the

00:28:57.958 --> 00:29:00.698
ground state,
in the lowest energy state,

00:29:00.698 --> 00:29:04.740
ammonia is flipping back and
forth 10^11 times a second.

00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:10.690
And in fact for a while that
was used as a fundamental clock;

00:29:10.690 --> 00:29:14.019
here was something that you
really knew the frequency of.

00:29:14.019 --> 00:29:17.161
Hooke, when he was trying to
devise a clock that could tell

00:29:17.161 --> 00:29:20.173
where you were in longitude,
could've used ammonia,

00:29:20.173 --> 00:29:22.480
if he'd had the technology to
do it,

00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:25.390
which would be an absolute
frequency.

00:29:25.390 --> 00:29:30.611
Okay, so IR shows -- completely
confirms what we said before,

00:29:30.611 --> 00:29:34.180
that BH_3_ is stiff
and flat;

00:29:34.180 --> 00:29:39.211
CH_3 is easily bent and flat;
and NH_3 is not bent,

00:29:39.211 --> 00:29:45.108
but can tunnel back and forth,
by the umbrella motion.

00:29:45.108 --> 00:29:48.615
Okay, so now the other
technique I want to tell you

00:29:48.615 --> 00:29:51.980
about is electron spin resonance
spectroscopy.

00:29:51.980 --> 00:29:54.904
And it turns out -- and we
don't have time to go into this

00:29:54.904 --> 00:29:56.863
--
well you know already that

00:29:56.863 --> 00:30:01.105
electrons are magnetic,
and some nuclei are magnetic,

00:30:01.105 --> 00:30:06.128
and you can get a magnetic
interaction between the nucleus

00:30:06.128 --> 00:30:10.165
and the electron,
which influences how hard it is

00:30:10.165 --> 00:30:14.257
to change the electron from
being pointing one way to being

00:30:14.257 --> 00:30:15.950
pointing another way.
 

00:30:15.950 --> 00:30:19.568
That's a kind of spectroscopy;
see what color of light you

00:30:19.568 --> 00:30:23.305
need to make an electron flip
from being pointed one way to

00:30:23.305 --> 00:30:24.400
the other way.
 

00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:29.058
But it's influenced by the
magnet, which is the nucleus.

00:30:29.058 --> 00:30:35.101
But there's a neat thing about
it, which is that influence can

00:30:35.101 --> 00:30:40.348
occur only when the electron is
inside the nucleus.

00:30:40.348 --> 00:30:44.968
Where, in a 1s orbital,
is the highest electron

00:30:44.968 --> 00:30:45.838
density?
 

00:30:45.838 --> 00:30:48.859
Remember the formula for a
1s electron?

00:30:48.859 --> 00:30:52.400
What's the atomic orbital?
 

00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:54.890
It's a constant times what?
 

00:30:54.890 --> 00:30:56.450
Prof: e^-ρ.
 

00:30:56.450 --> 00:30:57.819
Where's it biggest?
 

00:30:57.819 --> 00:30:59.368
Student:  At zero.
 

00:30:59.368 --> 00:31:04.362
Prof: Inside the nucleus
is the most dense part of the

00:31:04.362 --> 00:31:05.111
electron.
 

00:31:05.111 --> 00:31:05.858
Right?
 

00:31:05.858 --> 00:31:09.442
So when the electron is inside
the nucleus it feels this

00:31:09.442 --> 00:31:10.028
effect.
 

00:31:10.028 --> 00:31:13.117
When it's not inside the
nucleus it does not feel the

00:31:13.117 --> 00:31:15.910
effect, for the purpose of this
spectroscopy.

00:31:15.910 --> 00:31:17.009
Okay?
 

00:31:17.009 --> 00:31:21.477
So we can measure how much
s character there is in a

00:31:21.477 --> 00:31:26.020
hybrid orbital that holds an
electron by seeing how strongly

00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:29.410
the nucleus interacts with the
electron;

00:31:29.410 --> 00:31:33.268
because it happens only to the
extent that it's s.

00:31:33.268 --> 00:31:33.818
Right?
 

00:31:33.818 --> 00:31:37.790
So we could measure the percent
of s character by

00:31:37.790 --> 00:31:41.690
measuring the light that's
absorbed by the electron.

00:31:41.690 --> 00:31:42.730
Christopher?
 

00:31:42.730 --> 00:31:46.221
Student:  How could the
electron ever actually be inside

00:31:46.221 --> 00:31:47.009
the nucleus?
 

00:31:47.009 --> 00:31:49.396
Wouldn't that have two
particles occupying the same

00:31:49.396 --> 00:31:49.779
space?
 

00:31:49.779 --> 00:31:52.368
Prof: But they're
different particles.

00:31:52.368 --> 00:31:57.587
And in fact it's a little more
complicated than that,

00:31:57.587 --> 00:32:03.710
because what's the kinetic
energy, if the distance is zero?

00:32:03.710 --> 00:32:06.109
Coulombic energy is 1/r.
 

00:32:06.109 --> 00:32:08.430
Suppose r is zero.
 

00:32:08.430 --> 00:32:11.369
What's the kinetic energy?
 

00:32:11.369 --> 00:32:13.230
Student: It's infinite.
 

00:32:13.230 --> 00:32:15.078
Prof: Infinite. Right?
 

00:32:15.078 --> 00:32:17.718
Now, that means the electron is
really zinging,

00:32:17.718 --> 00:32:20.413
which means it becomes
relativistic and its mass

00:32:20.413 --> 00:32:23.108
changes and all sorts of wild
things occur.

00:32:23.108 --> 00:32:26.180
So it's actually that which
causes this interaction.

00:32:26.180 --> 00:32:32.150
So we'll leave that across the
way here in Sloane Physics Lab.

00:32:32.150 --> 00:32:32.900
Okay?
 

00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:35.994
And take it from me,
that the amount of this

00:32:35.994 --> 00:32:40.385
splitting that you see in the
ESR spectrum depends on how much

00:32:40.385 --> 00:32:43.769
s character there is on
the orbital.

00:32:43.769 --> 00:32:44.868
Okay?
 

00:32:44.868 --> 00:32:49.050
And you can worry about whether
it's precisely inside the

00:32:49.050 --> 00:32:53.829
nucleus, or just so heavy and
fast that it's behaving weirdly.

00:32:53.829 --> 00:32:54.349
Okay?
 

00:32:54.349 --> 00:32:56.950
But anyhow, that's the trick.
 

00:32:56.950 --> 00:33:00.230
Okay, so the singly-occupied
molecular orbital,

00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:01.990
the one where there's only one
electron,

00:33:01.990 --> 00:33:08.740
in CH_3, will give rise to
electron spin resonance,

00:33:08.740 --> 00:33:12.335
and the magnitude of this
effect will tell you how much

00:33:12.335 --> 00:33:14.200
s orbital there is.
 

00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:15.720
Okay, so let's look at it.
 

00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:17.358
And this is what I just said.
 

00:33:17.358 --> 00:33:19.769
There's a line separation due
to magnetic interaction,

00:33:19.769 --> 00:33:23.087
and it occurs only if the
electron spends time on the

00:33:23.087 --> 00:33:24.923
nucleus,
which happens only for an

00:33:24.923 --> 00:33:26.926
s orbital;
so we can measure how much

00:33:26.926 --> 00:33:27.750
s orbital.
 

00:33:27.750 --> 00:33:31.448
Okay, so here's a picture of
planar CH_3, and the orbital,

00:33:31.448 --> 00:33:34.238
the singly occupied molecular
orbital, SOMO,

00:33:34.238 --> 00:33:36.250
that contains the electron.
 

00:33:36.250 --> 00:33:40.920
How much time is it spending on
the nucleus?

00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:43.497
Zero;
there's a node at the nucleus,

00:33:43.497 --> 00:33:44.980
it's in a p orbital.
 

00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:48.328
Now suppose we bend it,
so it looks like that;

00:33:48.328 --> 00:33:51.190
or we could look inside and it
looks like that.

00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:56.967
Now it's got some s
character, in that orbital.

00:33:56.967 --> 00:33:57.838
Right?
 

00:33:57.838 --> 00:34:01.332
And if we make little boxes and
blow them up to see what it

00:34:01.332 --> 00:34:03.500
looks like down near the
nucleus,

00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:07.471
one of them has no density at
the nucleus and the other has

00:34:07.471 --> 00:34:09.800
electron density at the nucleus.
 

00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:13.750
So you'll see magnetic
interaction, in this case.

00:34:13.750 --> 00:34:15.889
If it's bent you'll see
magnetic interaction,

00:34:15.889 --> 00:34:19.882
and the more bent,
the smaller that angle from 120

00:34:19.882 --> 00:34:22.135
--
remember, the smaller the

00:34:22.135 --> 00:34:25.139
angle, so it'll go down toward
ninety;

00:34:25.139 --> 00:34:28.550
the more s character,
there'll be more of it.

00:34:28.550 --> 00:34:31.050
Okay, so here's what you see
for CH_3.

00:34:31.050 --> 00:34:36.485
Bear in mind it has to be
magnetic C, it has to be C-13^(

00:34:36.485 --> 00:34:41.050
)H_3, not C-12,
in order to see the spitting.

00:34:41.050 --> 00:34:43.983
But at any rate,
the amount of this effect is

00:34:43.983 --> 00:34:47.182
thirty-eight gauss,
which are the units it can be

00:34:47.182 --> 00:34:48.250
measured in.
 

00:34:48.250 --> 00:34:53.190
And that implies that,
on average, it's 2% s.

00:34:53.190 --> 00:34:58.253
Now, remember we already said
that its lowest energy form is

00:34:58.253 --> 00:35:00.400
flat, with no s.
 

00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:04.018
But it's constantly undergoing
this umbrella vibration.

00:35:04.018 --> 00:35:07.657
So it's spending time with
different amounts of s

00:35:07.657 --> 00:35:10.170
character, not zero,
as it vibrates.

00:35:10.170 --> 00:35:13.119
And the average is 2%.
 

00:35:13.119 --> 00:35:18.498
Now suppose I made the
hydrogens heavier,

00:35:18.498 --> 00:35:22.130
by making them deuterium.
 

00:35:22.130 --> 00:35:23.969
So I make the atoms heavier.
 

00:35:23.969 --> 00:35:26.914
Do you remember how that
changes the shape of the

00:35:26.914 --> 00:35:29.429
wavefunction,
if I make things heavier?

00:35:29.429 --> 00:35:32.969
Here it is for H is moving.
 

00:35:32.969 --> 00:35:36.708
What if it were deuteriums that
are moving, how will the thing

00:35:36.708 --> 00:35:37.260
change?
 

00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:38.099
Student:
&gt;

00:35:38.099 --> 00:35:39.699
Prof: It'll get narrower.
 

00:35:39.699 --> 00:35:43.012
So as it gets narrower,
that means it's not bending as

00:35:43.012 --> 00:35:44.199
much, on average.
 

00:35:44.199 --> 00:35:47.360
And what should happen to the
thirty-eight gauss,

00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:49.268
if it doesn't bend as much?
 

00:35:49.268 --> 00:35:52.949
Student:
&gt;

00:35:52.949 --> 00:35:56.789
Prof: I'll let you think
about it a second.

00:35:56.789 --> 00:36:00.226
It's only when it's bent that
it has s character and

00:36:00.226 --> 00:36:01.530
you see this effect.
 

00:36:01.530 --> 00:36:05.079
If it were rigidly flat,
the splitting would be zero;

00:36:05.079 --> 00:36:06.369
thirty-eight would be zero.
 

00:36:06.369 --> 00:36:10.641
What would happen if I change H
to D, so that it doesn't bend as

00:36:10.641 --> 00:36:11.929
much, on average?
 

00:36:11.929 --> 00:36:14.780
Sophie, what would you say?
 

00:36:14.780 --> 00:36:15.659
Student:
[inaudible&gt;&gt;

00:36:15.659 --> 00:36:16.039
Prof: Can't hear.
 

00:36:16.039 --> 00:36:17.789
Student:  If it was more
rigid it would --

00:36:17.789 --> 00:36:20.425
Prof: If it were more
rigid it would -- how big would

00:36:20.425 --> 00:36:21.139
the effect be?
 

00:36:21.139 --> 00:36:24.079
Bigger or smaller, the gauss?
 

00:36:24.079 --> 00:36:24.840
Student:  Smaller.
 

00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:25.570
Prof: Pardon me?
 

00:36:25.570 --> 00:36:27.309
Student:  Smaller.
 

00:36:27.309 --> 00:36:29.219
Prof: Thirty-six. Right?
 

00:36:29.219 --> 00:36:33.097
So again it confirms what we're
saying, that it prefers to be

00:36:33.097 --> 00:36:33.550
flat.
 

00:36:33.550 --> 00:36:36.554
It's only when it bends that
you get this effect,

00:36:36.554 --> 00:36:40.500
and it bends less with heavier
atoms than with lighter atoms.

00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:42.150
Wonderful.
 

00:36:42.150 --> 00:36:43.880
So again it confirms what we
said.

00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:46.179
There's what CD_3_
looks like.

00:36:46.179 --> 00:36:50.672
It's a little bit narrower and
therefore a little bit less of

00:36:50.672 --> 00:36:52.768
this magnetic interaction.
 

00:36:52.768 --> 00:36:56.170
So this is a structural isotope
effect.

00:36:56.170 --> 00:37:00.927
CH_3 spends more time more bent
than CD_3, and thus uses more

00:37:00.927 --> 00:37:04.257
s character,
and thus gives a bigger

00:37:04.257 --> 00:37:06.239
magnetic interaction.
 

00:37:06.239 --> 00:37:09.190
Okay, so again we've confirmed
what we predicted.

00:37:09.190 --> 00:37:13.202
Now here's one that we didn't
work on in predicting,

00:37:13.202 --> 00:37:13.989
is CF_3.
 

00:37:13.989 --> 00:37:18.679
Now what's changing H to F
going to do?

00:37:18.679 --> 00:37:19.639
Well, it's going to be heavier.
 

00:37:19.639 --> 00:37:22.724
So the same deal that would
happen with deuterium should

00:37:22.724 --> 00:37:23.510
happen here.
 

00:37:23.510 --> 00:37:27.626
But there might be more to it
than that, because now we have

00:37:27.626 --> 00:37:31.603
more protons and a bigger
nuclear charge of the atoms that

00:37:31.603 --> 00:37:32.860
were H before.
 

00:37:32.860 --> 00:37:40.559
So they're going to attract the
electrons in the bond more.

00:37:40.559 --> 00:37:43.599
So, but there's another thing
too.

00:37:43.599 --> 00:37:46.586
Because the fluorines have a
partial negative charge,

00:37:46.586 --> 00:37:48.827
and are bigger,
they have more electrons

00:37:48.827 --> 00:37:51.239
altogether, they'll repel one
another.

00:37:51.239 --> 00:37:55.987
Now what would -- if the things
attached to the central carbon

00:37:55.987 --> 00:38:00.346
get bigger and repel one
another, what effect should that

00:38:00.346 --> 00:38:02.369
have on it being bent?
 

00:38:02.369 --> 00:38:04.420
Should it make it easier or
harder to bend?

00:38:04.420 --> 00:38:05.659
Student:  Harder.
 

00:38:05.659 --> 00:38:08.389
Prof: If these things
are big here?

00:38:08.389 --> 00:38:11.231
Easier to bend from flat,
or harder, if these things are

00:38:11.231 --> 00:38:12.130
--
Students:  Harder.

00:38:12.130 --> 00:38:13.630
Prof: Harder, right?
 

00:38:13.630 --> 00:38:17.634
So valence electron pair
repulsion, and all that,

00:38:17.634 --> 00:38:21.889
should say that if CH_3 is
flat, what about CF_3?

00:38:21.889 --> 00:38:23.429
Student:  It's flatter.
 

00:38:23.429 --> 00:38:26.416
Prof: It should really
be flat, harder to bend,

00:38:26.416 --> 00:38:28.050
if these things are bigger.
 

00:38:28.050 --> 00:38:28.860
Okay.
 

00:38:28.860 --> 00:38:33.300
But there's another point of
view that you can take,

00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:38.262
which is that fluorine has the
lion's share of the bonding

00:38:38.262 --> 00:38:39.829
electron pair.
 

00:38:39.829 --> 00:38:43.505
The bonding electron pair,
in each of the C-F bonds,

00:38:43.505 --> 00:38:47.469
is spending more time near
fluorine than near carbon.

00:38:47.469 --> 00:38:51.150
So carbon, being a cagy sort of
character,

00:38:51.150 --> 00:38:55.639
says, "Why should I waste
my valuable s character

00:38:55.639 --> 00:38:59.532
trying to stabilize these
electrons that are spending

00:38:59.532 --> 00:39:02.150
their time on fluorine
anyway?"

00:39:02.150 --> 00:39:03.050
Right?
 

00:39:03.050 --> 00:39:06.940
"Why don't I use it to
stabilize that other electron,

00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:10.079
that's only on me and not on
fluorine?"

00:39:10.079 --> 00:39:11.809
Got the idea?
 

00:39:11.809 --> 00:39:16.585
So if carbon uses its s
character to go to the odd

00:39:16.585 --> 00:39:19.215
electron,
forgetting the ones that are

00:39:19.215 --> 00:39:22.672
mostly on fluorine anyway,
then that would make it more

00:39:22.672 --> 00:39:23.070
bent.
 

00:39:23.070 --> 00:39:26.576
That would favor bending,
if you put the s

00:39:26.576 --> 00:39:30.739
character in the odd electron
rather than in the bonds.

00:39:30.739 --> 00:39:33.849
That'll favor using more
p character in the bonds

00:39:33.849 --> 00:39:35.489
and therefore more bending.
 

00:39:35.489 --> 00:39:39.891
So this is exactly the kind of
thing that Bacon would have

00:39:39.891 --> 00:39:40.355
liked.
 

00:39:40.355 --> 00:39:41.050
Right?
 

00:39:41.050 --> 00:39:42.389
This is a crucial experiment.
 

00:39:42.389 --> 00:39:45.797
There are two opposite
predictions, and you can do an

00:39:45.797 --> 00:39:48.679
experiment and find out which
one is true.

00:39:48.679 --> 00:39:52.846
Is it that fluorine is bigger
and negatively charged,

00:39:52.846 --> 00:39:55.010
so it makes it more flat?
 

00:39:55.010 --> 00:39:58.170
Or is it that the carbon says,
"I want to put my

00:39:58.170 --> 00:40:00.505
electron,
the only electron I'm really

00:40:00.505 --> 00:40:03.916
solely responsible for,
in the orbital with the most

00:40:03.916 --> 00:40:04.974
s?"
 

00:40:04.974 --> 00:40:05.539
Right?
 

00:40:05.539 --> 00:40:09.130
So this is a real horserace and
you place your bets.

00:40:09.130 --> 00:40:09.590
Okay?
 

00:40:09.590 --> 00:40:13.460
Now how many people think it's
-- we'll guess ahead of time --

00:40:13.460 --> 00:40:15.619
how many people think that
fluorines are bigger and

00:40:15.619 --> 00:40:19.666
negatively charged,
so it will be harder to bend

00:40:19.666 --> 00:40:21.989
away from planarity?
 

00:40:21.989 --> 00:40:25.538
And how many people think that
it's the odd electron,

00:40:25.538 --> 00:40:28.610
that you want to put s
character in?

00:40:28.610 --> 00:40:30.489
Well this is very close.
 

00:40:30.489 --> 00:40:31.000
Okay?
 

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:32.909
So we'll have to look at
experiment.

00:40:32.909 --> 00:40:35.987
Okay, so this is the
singly-occupied molecular

00:40:35.987 --> 00:40:37.219
orbital of CF_3.
 

00:40:37.219 --> 00:40:43.307
It's mostly on the central
carbon, but a little bit on the

00:40:43.307 --> 00:40:44.590
fluorines.
 

00:40:44.590 --> 00:40:47.023
And if you look in the middle,
you see that there's the

00:40:47.023 --> 00:40:48.599
s character on the
carbon.

00:40:48.599 --> 00:40:54.269
And if we measure the
splitting, it's 271 gauss.

00:40:54.269 --> 00:40:56.269
What was it for methane?
 

00:40:56.269 --> 00:40:57.360
Students:  Thirty-eight.
 

00:40:57.360 --> 00:40:58.860
Prof: Thirty-eight.
 

00:40:58.860 --> 00:41:02.635
This is ten times almost,
or whatever number of times,

00:41:02.635 --> 00:41:06.626
maybe like eight times more
s character than there

00:41:06.626 --> 00:41:07.980
was in methane.
 

00:41:07.980 --> 00:41:11.570
What's the conclusion?
 

00:41:11.570 --> 00:41:15.931
It's much more bent,
much more of the time,

00:41:15.931 --> 00:41:18.425
than CH_3_ is.
 

00:41:18.425 --> 00:41:19.360
Right?
 

00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:22.079
Okay, so that means it's 20%
s.

00:41:22.079 --> 00:41:25.543
That means that it's
sp^4 in that,

00:41:25.543 --> 00:41:27.190
almost sp^3.
 

00:41:27.190 --> 00:41:27.969
Right?
 

00:41:27.969 --> 00:41:31.402
So it's almost perfectly
pyramidal, like methane would

00:41:31.402 --> 00:41:31.597
be.
 

00:41:31.597 --> 00:41:32.179
Right?
 

00:41:32.179 --> 00:41:35.481
So it's the character of that
odd electron,

00:41:35.481 --> 00:41:39.018
wanting to be s,
that's controlling the

00:41:39.018 --> 00:41:40.039
geometry.
 

00:41:40.039 --> 00:41:43.000
Okay, now we're going to get to
what Christopher wanted,

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:46.135
which is why the heck are we
talking about bonds when we've

00:41:46.135 --> 00:41:49.000
been talking about molecular
orbitals all the time?

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:51.844
Well one reason is we
wanted to talk about

00:41:51.844 --> 00:41:52.320
bonds.
 

00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:55.793
That's how we got into this
whole thing, asking what bonds

00:41:55.793 --> 00:41:56.159
are.
 

00:41:56.159 --> 00:41:57.340
Okay?
 

00:41:57.340 --> 00:42:00.670
But there are three different
operators here,

00:42:00.670 --> 00:42:04.380
and they have different
motivation and methods.

00:42:04.380 --> 00:42:07.219
First there's the molecule
deciding what to be;

00:42:07.219 --> 00:42:11.188
and then there's the computer
doing quantum mechanics,

00:42:11.188 --> 00:42:14.110
deciding what the molecule
should do;

00:42:14.110 --> 00:42:20.309
and then there's you,
trying to understand all this.

00:42:20.309 --> 00:42:21.768
And these are different.
 

00:42:21.768 --> 00:42:24.820
And let's see the way in which
they're different.

00:42:24.820 --> 00:42:27.090
The experimental molecule,
all it wants to know --

00:42:27.090 --> 00:42:29.480
it doesn't care about
Schrödinger --

00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:32.530
all it wants to do is get the
lowest possible energy.

00:42:32.530 --> 00:42:35.726
So it minimized the total
energy, kinetic plus Coulomb

00:42:35.726 --> 00:42:37.836
energies,
of the electrons and the

00:42:37.836 --> 00:42:41.190
nuclei, by just settling down
into the most comfortable,

00:42:41.190 --> 00:42:43.949
lowest energy arrangement.
 

00:42:43.949 --> 00:42:44.429
Okay?
 

00:42:44.429 --> 00:42:47.159
That's what the molecule does,
it just gets happy.

00:42:47.159 --> 00:42:48.159
Okay?
 

00:42:48.159 --> 00:42:50.583
And once it does that,
then it has a certain

00:42:50.583 --> 00:42:53.742
structure, a certain arrangement
of the nuclei and of the

00:42:53.742 --> 00:42:54.869
electron clouds.
 

00:42:54.869 --> 00:42:57.867
It has a total electron
density, which you can measure

00:42:57.867 --> 00:42:58.489
by X-ray.
 

00:42:58.489 --> 00:43:01.590
It has certain energies that we
showed measuring by IR;

00:43:01.590 --> 00:43:04.250
although you can measure them
other ways as well.

00:43:04.250 --> 00:43:07.472
It has nuclear electron
density, that we just measured

00:43:07.472 --> 00:43:08.018
by ESR.
 

00:43:08.018 --> 00:43:11.394
It has dipole moment,
how much there's a separation

00:43:11.394 --> 00:43:14.838
of positive and negative,
that you can -- that if it

00:43:14.838 --> 00:43:17.268
vibrates gives off IR and so on.
 

00:43:17.268 --> 00:43:22.106
So there are these real things
that come from the molecule just

00:43:22.106 --> 00:43:24.369
doing what comes naturally.
 

00:43:24.369 --> 00:43:25.889
So it doesn't care about
Schrödinger.

00:43:25.889 --> 00:43:28.750
Now you have a computer that
comes along,

00:43:28.750 --> 00:43:30.929
armed with Schrödinger's
equation,

00:43:30.929 --> 00:43:34.313
and it knows it can't possibly
solve the true Schrödinger

00:43:34.313 --> 00:43:36.480
equation,
it's too complicated.

00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:40.610
So it'll do some approximation
and try to get an approximate

00:43:40.610 --> 00:43:41.170
value.
 

00:43:41.170 --> 00:43:43.704
So it'll minimize the total
energy, using the

00:43:43.704 --> 00:43:46.297
Schrödinger equation,
with some realistic

00:43:46.297 --> 00:43:48.110
constraints;
for example,

00:43:48.110 --> 00:43:50.860
using orbitals,
or using configuration

00:43:50.860 --> 00:43:54.353
interaction, or using density
functional theory,

00:43:54.353 --> 00:43:56.360
or some approximation.
 

00:43:56.360 --> 00:43:57.940
Okay?
 

00:43:57.940 --> 00:44:01.440
So it'll use like a limited set
of atomic orbitals,

00:44:01.440 --> 00:44:04.583
only say 2s and -- it
won't use the 5p orbital

00:44:04.583 --> 00:44:07.250
or the 5g orbital or
something like that.

00:44:07.250 --> 00:44:10.777
Use Self-Consistent Field,
or some correlation,

00:44:10.777 --> 00:44:14.230
or delocalized molecular
orbitals come out.

00:44:14.230 --> 00:44:20.809
And its goal is to get a useful
prediction of the properties;

00:44:20.809 --> 00:44:23.706
maybe the electron density,
maybe the energy,

00:44:23.706 --> 00:44:26.998
maybe the vibration frequency,
maybe absorption of,

00:44:26.998 --> 00:44:30.159
what colors of light get
absorbed and so on.

00:44:30.159 --> 00:44:33.420
So the goal of the computer is
to use any tricks it can get

00:44:33.420 --> 00:44:35.844
around --
it can do, and it doesn't care

00:44:35.844 --> 00:44:38.492
how hard it works --
it's not something you have to

00:44:38.492 --> 00:44:40.199
be able to do on a piece of
paper --

00:44:40.199 --> 00:44:41.530
just to get something useful.
 

00:44:41.530 --> 00:44:44.931
And it will be validated,
the approximations you made,

00:44:44.931 --> 00:44:45.960
by experiment.
 

00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:48.262
If it agrees with experiment,
then you can believe the

00:44:48.262 --> 00:44:48.739
computer.
 

00:44:48.739 --> 00:44:51.759
But that doesn't mean you
understand what the computer

00:44:51.759 --> 00:44:51.987
did.
 

00:44:51.987 --> 00:44:52.500
Right?
 

00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:55.000
It's a really complicated
calculation.

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:58.050
And that's different from what
you want to do,

00:44:58.050 --> 00:45:01.239
because your goal is to
understand structure and

00:45:01.239 --> 00:45:04.630
reactivity, with the simplest
realistic model;

00:45:04.630 --> 00:45:07.090
not Schrödinger's
fundamental equation,

00:45:07.090 --> 00:45:09.949
because you don't have the
brain power to manipulate

00:45:09.949 --> 00:45:13.090
numbers that way and do all
these integrals and so on;

00:45:13.090 --> 00:45:14.650
leave that to the computer.
 

00:45:14.650 --> 00:45:16.719
Your goal is to try to look at
things and understand:

00:45:16.719 --> 00:45:16.920
ah!
 

00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:19.420
that should be reactive with
this;

00:45:19.420 --> 00:45:23.672
that bond should be very stiff;
that molecular structure should

00:45:23.672 --> 00:45:26.677
be very stiff because the,
quote, "bonds"

00:45:26.677 --> 00:45:27.820
should be stiff.
 

00:45:27.820 --> 00:45:28.119
Okay?
 

00:45:28.119 --> 00:45:31.188
That's what you want to do is
to develop an intuition that

00:45:31.188 --> 00:45:33.989
allows you to understand
structure and reactivity.

00:45:33.989 --> 00:45:38.739
And you want the simplest,
obviously, but realistic model.

00:45:38.739 --> 00:45:44.222
And that, to be both simple and
realistic, may not be possible.

00:45:44.222 --> 00:45:44.929
Right?
 

00:45:44.929 --> 00:45:47.989
There's a certain tension there.
 

00:45:47.989 --> 00:45:50.860
Okay?
 

00:45:50.860 --> 00:45:53.119
So what kind of things you'll
talk about?

00:45:53.119 --> 00:45:55.239
You'll talk about localized
bonds.

00:45:55.239 --> 00:45:57.862
You won't talk about these big
things that are complicated and

00:45:57.862 --> 00:45:59.110
go over the whole molecule.
 

00:45:59.110 --> 00:46:01.268
It's interesting to see,
for example,

00:46:01.268 --> 00:46:04.068
that those are analogous to
atomic orbitals and that kinetic

00:46:04.068 --> 00:46:08.277
energy plays a part in them,
but that doesn't empower you to

00:46:08.277 --> 00:46:11.280
predict the properties of
things.

00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:11.889
Okay?
 

00:46:11.889 --> 00:46:14.041
So you want to talk about
localized bonds,

00:46:14.041 --> 00:46:16.929
maybe pretend they're springs
or something like that.

00:46:16.929 --> 00:46:19.909
And what makes a spring stiff
or not stiff?

00:46:19.909 --> 00:46:22.730
And that, Christopher,
is why we have been talking

00:46:22.730 --> 00:46:25.896
about springs and things here,
rather than talking about

00:46:25.896 --> 00:46:27.219
molecular orbitals.
 

00:46:27.219 --> 00:46:31.969
So you talk about -- these are
Lewis's ideas -- bonds,

00:46:31.969 --> 00:46:34.480
lone-pairs, hybridization.
 

00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:37.489
We talk about energy-match and
overlap.

00:46:37.489 --> 00:46:40.489
And we'll be talking soon about
HOMOs and LUMOs --

00:46:40.489 --> 00:46:42.710
highest occupied molecular
orbital,

00:46:42.710 --> 00:46:44.929
lowest unoccupied molecular
orbital --

00:46:44.929 --> 00:46:47.190
and what a very important thing
those are.

00:46:47.190 --> 00:46:50.188
So we're going to look at just
little bits of things,

00:46:50.188 --> 00:46:53.244
to try to find out what's
crucial and will allow us to

00:46:53.244 --> 00:46:54.110
understand.
 

00:46:54.110 --> 00:46:55.630
We want them to be realistic.
 

00:46:55.630 --> 00:46:59.434
We want them fundamentally to
be based on something true,

00:46:59.434 --> 00:47:02.559
like quantum mechanics,
not just on springs.

00:47:02.559 --> 00:47:05.380
But we have to make it simple
enough to understand.

00:47:05.380 --> 00:47:08.139
So we're aiming for qualitative
insight.

00:47:08.139 --> 00:47:11.695
And we'll know when we're right
if we agree with experiment,

00:47:11.695 --> 00:47:15.010
and also if we agree with what
the computer predicts;

00:47:15.010 --> 00:47:17.934
even though the computer
doesn't know why it predicted

00:47:17.934 --> 00:47:20.750
it, it just grinds through and
gets you a number.

00:47:20.750 --> 00:47:25.230
But we want to understand why
the computer gets that number.

00:47:25.230 --> 00:47:26.139
Okay.
 

00:47:26.139 --> 00:47:28.360
So let me just do one thing
quickly here.

00:47:28.360 --> 00:47:30.159
Pathological Bonding.
 

00:47:30.159 --> 00:47:32.250
Or let me let you go to your
next class;

00:47:32.250 --> 00:47:35.489
we'll do Pathological Bonding
next time.

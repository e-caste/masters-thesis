00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:06.569
Prof: Now also I would
like to spend a couple of

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:12.900
minutes kind of wrapping up some
issues about the four authors,

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.640
what we covered in the
test--right?--

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:19.543
Marx, Nietzsche,
Freud and Weber,

00:00:19.543 --> 00:00:24.910
just to help you to get an
overall sense--

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.690
right?--what the bottom line
is, and what the similarities

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:30.150
and differences are.
 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.420
And then I'll go into Max Weber.
 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:34.150
There's a lot I want to cover
today.

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:36.650
Would love to talk a lot about
his life;

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:37.900
I won't have time.
 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:42.089
I could give you a lot of nice
and juicy stories,

00:00:42.089 --> 00:00:45.494
what I have,
but unfortunately I have to

00:00:45.494 --> 00:00:47.240
withhold myself.
 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.850
Okay, so the four authors.
 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.554
There is one important common
feature in all four authors,

00:00:56.554 --> 00:01:02.658
and somewhat distinct from the
theorists we studied so far.

00:01:02.658 --> 00:01:07.623
In one way or another,
all four of them call be called

00:01:07.623 --> 00:01:09.590
critical theorists.
 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.992
That means they all offer
critical analysis of what is in

00:01:14.992 --> 00:01:16.150
your mind.
 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:21.599
They say, "What is in your
mind is not necessarily what you

00:01:21.599 --> 00:01:22.810
think it is.
 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.686
Let's subject your
consciousness to critical

00:01:26.686 --> 00:01:28.220
scrutiny."
 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:33.572
I think all four do share this
argument.

00:01:33.572 --> 00:01:34.670
Right?
 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.495
Marx certainly,
with the idea that well the

00:01:39.495 --> 00:01:47.310
dominant ideas of each epoch are
the ideas of the dominant class,

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:53.569
and therefore you think what is
in your mind is your idea.

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:57.203
"Tell me what your class
position is and I will tell you

00:01:57.203 --> 00:02:00.109
where your ideas are coming
from." Right?

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:06.540
Now this is Nietzsche's project.
 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.710
He said, "Well,
you think this is morality?

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:13.935
I will show the immorality of
morality, what you think is

00:02:13.935 --> 00:02:15.520
moral." Right?
 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.500
This is certainly Freud.
 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.419
"You think this is your
ideas?

00:02:20.419 --> 00:02:26.060
Well lay on my couch and talk
to me,

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:31.264
and I will--you will recall all
these early sexual experiences

00:02:31.264 --> 00:02:34.809
in your life,
and then you will realize

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:37.598
what--who you really are."
 

00:02:37.598 --> 00:02:40.937
Well, you know,
Weber is a little more

00:02:40.937 --> 00:02:45.897
complicated, but he also has
this idea of legitimacy and

00:02:45.897 --> 00:02:50.860
domination--with some later
Marxist people on this.

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.473
And the fundamental idea of
Weber is coming also from

00:02:55.473 --> 00:02:56.538
Nietzsche.
 

00:02:56.538 --> 00:03:01.895
And the fundamental idea is
that we actually do internalize

00:03:01.895 --> 00:03:05.590
the very principles of our
submission.

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.540
That's what legitimacy,
at least in my interpretation,

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:11.849
in Weber is.
 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:13.919
There is domination. Right?
 

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:19.215
And therefore Weber also helps
you to understand--right?--where

00:03:19.215 --> 00:03:24.254
these ideas are coming from,
and to what extent you yourself

00:03:24.254 --> 00:03:26.389
are your own jail keeper.
 

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:27.330
Right?
 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:32.453
That's sort of mine--a little
post-modernist reading of Max

00:03:32.453 --> 00:03:33.160
Weber.
 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:38.026
So these are--in this way they
are all critical theorists.

00:03:38.026 --> 00:03:38.710
Right?
 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:41.740
They are critiques of
consciousness.

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:45.718
But there are fundamental
differences between the four

00:03:45.718 --> 00:03:46.470
authors.
 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:52.410
And in some ways there is a
similarity between Marx and

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:53.288
Freud.
 

00:03:53.288 --> 00:03:58.952
Marx and Freud all take their
point of departure in their

00:03:58.952 --> 00:04:04.715
project to be critical of
consciousness for sensuous human

00:04:04.715 --> 00:04:05.826
experience.
 

00:04:05.826 --> 00:04:06.939
Right?
 

00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:10.199
Material reality.
 

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:13.954
In one way or another they are
both materialists.

00:04:13.954 --> 00:04:14.580
Right?
 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:18.646
Of course, for Marx it is
reductionist,

00:04:18.646 --> 00:04:24.535
because this sensuous human
experience is reduced to the

00:04:24.535 --> 00:04:25.819
economy.
 

00:04:25.819 --> 00:04:31.110
"You tell me what your
position in the economic system

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:36.399
are, then I understand what your
economic interests are.

00:04:36.399 --> 00:04:39.461
You are behaving and you are
thinking according to your

00:04:39.461 --> 00:04:42.295
economic interests,
and then I will understand what

00:04:42.295 --> 00:04:43.769
is on your mind."
 

00:04:43.769 --> 00:04:47.043
Well, by the way,
it's not all that

00:04:47.043 --> 00:04:52.339
different--right?--from Adam
Smith and rationally acting

00:04:52.339 --> 00:04:53.879
individuals.
 

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:56.079
Marx has some similarities.
 

00:04:56.079 --> 00:04:59.586
Only he offers it critically,
while Adam Smith offered it

00:04:59.586 --> 00:05:00.589
affirmatively.
 

00:05:00.589 --> 00:05:05.524
But that is Marx's reductionism;
that what is sensuous

00:05:05.524 --> 00:05:09.370
experience is reduced to the
economy.

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:14.814
And then he also has an agency;
that's the big,

00:05:14.814 --> 00:05:18.079
unique feature of Marx's
theory.

00:05:18.079 --> 00:05:23.100
He knows what good society is;
does not describe in much

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:26.550
detail, but has an idea about
good society.

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:30.766
And he knows who the historical
agent is, who will lead us

00:05:30.766 --> 00:05:31.360
there.
 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.353
I mean, many of you were
probably turned off by his

00:05:35.353 --> 00:05:37.190
vision of the future.
 

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:41.579
But the strength of the theory
is that he has a vision of good

00:05:41.579 --> 00:05:44.529
society, and he knows how to get
there.

00:05:44.529 --> 00:05:49.454
So those of you who are looking
for answers, Karl Marx does have

00:05:49.454 --> 00:05:50.706
answers for you.
 

00:05:50.706 --> 00:05:51.410
Right?
 

00:05:51.410 --> 00:06:02.459
Now what about Freud?
 

00:06:02.459 --> 00:06:05.831
He does not quite have answers
to you.

00:06:05.831 --> 00:06:06.560
Right?
 

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:09.360
When you are lying on his
couch--right?--

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:15.838
he helps you to discover the
repressed desires in yourself,

00:06:15.838 --> 00:06:20.399
and then it will help you to
get rid of your depression,

00:06:20.399 --> 00:06:24.903
anxieties, hysteria,
or whatever you are suffering

00:06:24.903 --> 00:06:25.362
from.
 

00:06:25.362 --> 00:06:26.189
Right?
 

00:06:26.189 --> 00:06:31.276
But it will be up to
you--right?--to somehow figuring

00:06:31.276 --> 00:06:34.310
out what is repressed in you.
 

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:36.766
He only will help you to find
it.

00:06:36.766 --> 00:06:37.379
Right?
 

00:06:37.379 --> 00:06:42.829
Does he have a very clearly
defined good society?

00:06:42.829 --> 00:06:46.964
He has sort of ambiguous
attitudes about this.

00:06:46.964 --> 00:06:47.699
Right?
 

00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:51.540
Civilization,
modern civilization.

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:56.540
Well, this is coming from
repression.

00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:02.629
Civilization has a lot to do
how people are being controlled.

00:07:02.629 --> 00:07:06.473
On the other hand,
he knows out of the id a lot of

00:07:06.473 --> 00:07:11.021
nasty, aggressive stuff is
coming from, and they have to be

00:07:11.021 --> 00:07:12.120
repressed.
 

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:15.629
So he has a kind of ambiguous
attitude.

00:07:15.629 --> 00:07:19.267
He does not want to go against
civilization,

00:07:19.267 --> 00:07:24.430
but he sees the dark side of
civilization at the same time.

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:32.220
Now what is common in Nietzsche
and Weber,

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:35.879
that they all depart from this
idea--

00:07:35.879 --> 00:07:40.372
right?--that it is sensuous
experiences from which you have

00:07:40.372 --> 00:07:43.910
to understand--
right?--what's wrong with your

00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:45.019
consciousness.
 

00:07:45.019 --> 00:07:51.456
Their central concern is
power--right?--power and

00:07:51.456 --> 00:07:53.199
domination.
 

00:07:53.199 --> 00:07:59.310
It is not the economy,
it is not sexuality;

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:01.370
it is power.
 

00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:05.740
And interestingly in some ways,
therefore,

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:09.870
they probably reach back all
the way to Hobbes--

00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:15.492
right?--that all history of
humankind is struggle around

00:08:15.492 --> 00:08:16.310
power.
 

00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:21.290
Well this is the most radically
done by Nietzsche,

00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:24.819
because what Nietzsche is
doing--right?--

00:08:24.819 --> 00:08:28.829
he shows you how the most noble
ideas,

00:08:28.829 --> 00:08:34.450
what you have in your mind,
are actually manufactured--

00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:39.940
right?--in the workshop of
ideals, in very nasty ways,

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:44.850
by coercion--right?--by torture.
 

00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:49.830
And he shows you this
instrument of coercion.

00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:55.009
If the history of the
museum--historical museum of

00:08:55.009 --> 00:09:00.190
Marx is filled up with the means
of production;

00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:03.034
you go into a museum,
you can see the

00:09:03.034 --> 00:09:07.067
life-right?--how people lived,
what their house was,

00:09:07.067 --> 00:09:11.889
what the instruments were they
produced their livelihood.

00:09:11.889 --> 00:09:14.913
You see this in a lot of
contemporary museums,

00:09:14.913 --> 00:09:18.136
which are not Marxist,
but still inspired by this

00:09:18.136 --> 00:09:19.279
Marxian idea.
 

00:09:19.279 --> 00:09:21.629
Nietzsche's museum?
 

00:09:21.629 --> 00:09:25.235
Well you will find guillotines.
 

00:09:25.235 --> 00:09:26.048
Right?
 

00:09:26.048 --> 00:09:29.120
You will find all these
instruments of torture.

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:33.570
That's human history,
the history of torture.

00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:38.558
And that's where is an
interesting similarity between

00:09:38.558 --> 00:09:43.216
Weber and Nietzsche;
namely, that the history of

00:09:43.216 --> 00:09:47.837
humankind is evolution,
but this evolution has its

00:09:47.837 --> 00:09:48.970
downside.
 

00:09:48.970 --> 00:09:55.097
Our bodies may not be tortured
any longer in modern

00:09:55.097 --> 00:10:00.860
civilization,
but our souls are kept hostage.

00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:03.769
That's the bad news. Right?
 

00:10:03.769 --> 00:10:07.708
Now I think that's,
in a nutshell,

00:10:07.708 --> 00:10:13.677
I think the kind of
similarities and differences of

00:10:13.677 --> 00:10:19.168
the four authors we covered for
this test.

00:10:19.168 --> 00:10:21.750
And I don't think I have more
time to deal with this.

00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:25.519
So let's now go to Max Weber.
 

00:10:25.519 --> 00:10:28.250
And I am actually very
sensitive.

00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:33.527
Somebody asked a question
whether on the test the question

00:10:33.527 --> 00:10:36.490
on domination should be there?
 

00:10:36.490 --> 00:10:39.399
I will be thinking very hard
about this.

00:10:39.399 --> 00:10:42.395
In fact, if you still
have--very much dislike

00:10:42.395 --> 00:10:46.413
questions, send me an email and
I will try to take this into

00:10:46.413 --> 00:10:47.639
consideration.
 

00:10:47.639 --> 00:10:50.299
Okay, so this is Max Weber.
 

00:10:50.299 --> 00:10:56.440
Born in 1864 and died in 1920.
 

00:10:56.440 --> 00:11:03.210
Well nowadays with flu shots,
he would not have died.

00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:04.759
He just died of pneumonia.
 

00:11:04.759 --> 00:11:07.058
He probably would have lived
longer.

00:11:07.058 --> 00:11:11.466
Fortunately he did not,
because he did not live Nazism,

00:11:11.466 --> 00:11:15.464
and we do not have to ask the
unpleasant question,

00:11:15.464 --> 00:11:19.298
would have Max Weber turned
into be a Nazi?

00:11:19.298 --> 00:11:22.934
I doubt, but there are some who
believe he might have,

00:11:22.934 --> 00:11:25.610
and we will talk about this
later on.

00:11:25.610 --> 00:11:30.250
So a word about the Max Weber's
family.

00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:35.548
This is a Protestant family who
lived in the city of Salzburg,

00:11:35.548 --> 00:11:38.590
which was in the Hapsburg
Empire.

00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:44.250
It was actually an independent
city, ruled by an archbishop--a

00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:46.200
very Catholic city.
 

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:51.336
And by the late-eighteenth
century, this archbishop started

00:11:51.336 --> 00:11:55.500
to take the counterreformation
too seriously.

00:11:55.500 --> 00:12:00.509
So therefore those who were not
Roman Catholic better left.

00:12:00.509 --> 00:12:04.048
So did the Weber family,
and they moved to Germany,

00:12:04.048 --> 00:12:07.690
in the Rhineland,
and they settled in Bielefeld,

00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:11.309
and they set up a textile
manufacturing business,

00:12:11.309 --> 00:12:13.960
which operated pretty good.
 

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:19.745
Weber's father,
Max senior, was the younger of

00:12:19.745 --> 00:12:21.158
two sons.
 

00:12:21.158 --> 00:12:24.649
And the family business,
though it was doing okay,

00:12:24.649 --> 00:12:27.570
was not enough to support two
families.

00:12:27.570 --> 00:12:31.730
Therefore he was asked to learn
some trade.

00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:36.971
So he actually entered civil
service and became a politician

00:12:36.971 --> 00:12:38.750
and civil servant.
 

00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:42.779
Max Weber himself was born in
'64 in Erfurt,

00:12:42.779 --> 00:12:48.495
in the eastern part of Germany,
where his father was stationed

00:12:48.495 --> 00:12:50.090
at that time.
 

00:12:50.090 --> 00:12:53.389
And his mother was Helene
Fallenstein;

00:12:53.389 --> 00:12:56.200
a very sensitive,
wonderful woman.

00:12:56.200 --> 00:13:00.081
There were eight brothers and
sisters--a big family,

00:13:00.081 --> 00:13:01.678
and quite a family.
 

00:13:01.678 --> 00:13:08.232
Here you have the three
brothers: Max on the left,

00:13:08.232 --> 00:13:12.379
and the middle,
Alfred Weber.

00:13:12.379 --> 00:13:14.889
Alfred Weber was quite a
scholar.

00:13:14.889 --> 00:13:20.585
He was a younger brother of
Max, and he was a very prominent

00:13:20.585 --> 00:13:24.432
economist,
philosopher and sociologist,

00:13:24.432 --> 00:13:28.494
but primarily economist,
who was well known for the

00:13:28.494 --> 00:13:32.129
theory of industrial location,
in his times.

00:13:32.129 --> 00:13:35.700
He was a professor at
University of Heidelberg.

00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:37.870
He did not turn into a Nazi.
 

00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:42.660
He was actually laid off by the
Nazis, and re-instituted in

00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:43.240
1945.
 

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:47.758
Those of you who study in
economics industrial relation

00:13:47.758 --> 00:13:52.360
theory may have come across the
name of Alfred Weber.

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:54.980
He was actually the famous
Weber.

00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:59.230
Max Weber was less famous in
his time than Alfred.

00:13:59.230 --> 00:14:05.340
Now Max Weber's mother was
Helene, as I said.

00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:06.928
She was a wonderful lady.
 

00:14:06.928 --> 00:14:12.288
She was a devote Calvinist--so
now you can understand the role

00:14:12.288 --> 00:14:16.678
of Calvinism and the Protestant
Ethic in Weber--

00:14:16.678 --> 00:14:22.230
and was also greatly interested
in philanthropy.

00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:26.558
And that's where Weber's social
sensitivity is coming from.

00:14:26.558 --> 00:14:32.589
There was a great deal of
conflict between the sensitive

00:14:32.589 --> 00:14:37.705
Helene and Max senior,
who was a very authoritarian,

00:14:37.705 --> 00:14:40.970
paternalistic figure--
a very unpleasant guy.

00:14:40.970 --> 00:14:44.475
Politically also extremely
conservative,

00:14:44.475 --> 00:14:49.418
and they had quite a bit of
conflict with each other.

00:14:49.418 --> 00:14:52.639
Early in his life,
Max sided with his father--

00:14:52.639 --> 00:14:57.568
did what Freud said you will
do, when you would overcome your

00:14:57.568 --> 00:15:00.950
Oedipus complex,
you identify with your father.

00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:03.668
Okay, this is what he did.
 

00:15:03.668 --> 00:15:09.360
But then he actually shifted
and eventually sided with his

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:10.259
mother.
 

00:15:10.259 --> 00:15:11.600
Well this is the father.
 

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:14.940
Well I would not have liked him
as my father.

00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:22.488
He was a conservative
politician, a very patriarchal

00:15:22.488 --> 00:15:23.820
figure.
 

00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:29.750
He started in the municipality
as a civil servant in Erfurt.

00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:34.076
Then became actually a deputy
of the National Liberal Party,

00:15:34.076 --> 00:15:37.450
which had very little to do
with liberalism.

00:15:37.450 --> 00:15:38.460
It was a conservative party.
 

00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:44.297
This was under the
chancellorship of Otto von

00:15:44.297 --> 00:15:50.533
Bismarck, the Iron
Chancellor--real conservative

00:15:50.533 --> 00:15:53.320
times in Germany.
 

00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:58.298
Now about Weber's life.
 

00:15:58.298 --> 00:16:02.320
He studied in Heidelberg and
then in Berlin.

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:07.149
He studied both law and
agrarian history.

00:16:07.149 --> 00:16:13.503
Actually he was somewhere
between a legal theorist,

00:16:13.503 --> 00:16:17.570
a historian,
and an economist;

00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:20.149
he was kind of sociologist last.
 

00:16:20.149 --> 00:16:26.571
In '92, he married Marianne
Schnitger, who was a kind of

00:16:26.571 --> 00:16:28.440
second-cousin.
 

00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:31.740
I will come back to this
relationship later on.

00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:35.138
In '95, he was appointed
professor of economics at

00:16:35.138 --> 00:16:39.298
Freiberg, and then he moved to
Heidelberg, where he basically

00:16:39.298 --> 00:16:41.450
spent the rest of his life.
 

00:16:41.450 --> 00:16:47.629
He also became professor of
political science.

00:16:47.629 --> 00:16:54.214
He was involved early in his
life in very feverish academic

00:16:54.214 --> 00:16:55.690
activities.
 

00:16:55.690 --> 00:16:57.744
He published two Ph.D.
 

00:16:57.744 --> 00:17:02.038
dissertations,
one in law and one in history.

00:17:02.038 --> 00:17:03.346
The law Ph.D.
 

00:17:03.346 --> 00:17:07.265
was on commercial law in
Medieval Italy,

00:17:07.265 --> 00:17:12.390
and the history was on agrarian
history in Rome.

00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:16.657
Both books were published;
and they are actually not in

00:17:16.657 --> 00:17:17.519
English.
 

00:17:17.519 --> 00:17:24.330
A later version of the agrarian
history was published in

00:17:24.330 --> 00:17:25.568
Germany.
 

00:17:25.568 --> 00:17:30.900
'97, he suffered a very serious
nervous breakdown.

00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:33.900
I would love to talk in detail
about this.

00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:38.011
By all likelihood it had a lot
to do with his conflict with his

00:17:38.011 --> 00:17:38.608
father.
 

00:17:38.608 --> 00:17:45.358
Just during the summer of '97,
the mother visited--

00:17:45.358 --> 00:17:50.298
he visited the parents in
Berlin, and then the mother

00:17:50.298 --> 00:17:52.977
said,
"Well I want to visit you

00:17:52.977 --> 00:17:54.318
in Heidelberg."
 

00:17:54.318 --> 00:17:57.202
And then the father said,
"No, you can't,

00:17:57.202 --> 00:17:59.123
because I need you here."
 

00:17:59.123 --> 00:17:59.700
Right?
 

00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:02.490
"Who will cook my
breakfast?"

00:18:02.490 --> 00:18:06.480
And then Max Weber,
who was always subservient and

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:10.146
obedient to the father,
revolted, and he said,

00:18:10.146 --> 00:18:13.078
"Father,
you can't do that.

00:18:13.078 --> 00:18:16.811
If Mother wants to visit us,
she should be allowed to visit

00:18:16.811 --> 00:18:17.519
us."
 

00:18:17.519 --> 00:18:22.226
And this happened the first
time that Max Weber said no to

00:18:22.226 --> 00:18:23.298
the father.
 

00:18:23.298 --> 00:18:26.859
Well the father passed away
within two or three months,

00:18:26.859 --> 00:18:30.949
and just after the death of the
father Weber had a very serious

00:18:30.949 --> 00:18:32.400
nervous breakdown.
 

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:36.324
Well, no one knows exactly what
it had to do with the death of

00:18:36.324 --> 00:18:39.862
the father, but there is
certainly a correlation between

00:18:39.862 --> 00:18:41.019
the two facts.
 

00:18:41.019 --> 00:18:48.740
It was actually a very serious
disease.

00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:53.330
He was lucky to be married to a
wonderful and extremely smart

00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:57.155
woman,
Marianne--they married

00:18:57.155 --> 00:19:05.140
earlier--and Marianne was a
great help for him to recover

00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:09.558
from this nervous breakdown.
 

00:19:09.558 --> 00:19:14.133
For five years Weber could not
teach, could not write,

00:19:14.133 --> 00:19:15.598
could not read.
 

00:19:15.598 --> 00:19:19.950
He was just sitting in the
corner staring out of himself.

00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:22.588
Marianne took him to travels.
 

00:19:22.588 --> 00:19:25.480
They went to Italy and
eventually he recovered.

00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:30.413
'92, he's coming out of his
nervous breakdown and returns to

00:19:30.413 --> 00:19:34.928
Heidelberg, though he never
really took on very regular

00:19:34.928 --> 00:19:37.269
teaching duties anymore.
 

00:19:37.269 --> 00:19:41.900
1904, he had his only trip to
the USA.

00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:43.224
He went to the St.
 

00:19:43.224 --> 00:19:47.568
Louis World Fair and wrote a
wonderful paper at that time.

00:19:47.568 --> 00:19:53.872
And then in 1906--again,
I wish I would have more time

00:19:53.872 --> 00:19:58.509
to talk about the Richthofen
sisters.

00:19:58.509 --> 00:20:01.358
This is a great story.
 

00:20:01.358 --> 00:20:06.150
Anyway, he obviously falls in
love with Elsa von Richthofen.

00:20:06.150 --> 00:20:11.946
Else von Richthofen was
actually the wife of a good

00:20:11.946 --> 00:20:16.932
friend and colleague of Weber,
Jaffé,

00:20:16.932 --> 00:20:21.338
a major political social
theorist.

00:20:21.338 --> 00:20:25.640
Well this is a very important
event in Weber's life.

00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:27.460
It lasts until his death.
 

00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:31.923
It is actually not Marianne who
is standing by his deathbed,

00:20:31.923 --> 00:20:33.890
but Else von Richthofen.
 

00:20:33.890 --> 00:20:36.701
Interestingly,
Else and Marianne were very

00:20:36.701 --> 00:20:37.730
good friends.
 

00:20:37.730 --> 00:20:42.460
Again, I cannot resist to give
you a little gossip.

00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:46.801
But the best as we know,
the marriage with Marianne was

00:20:46.801 --> 00:20:48.170
never consumed.
 

00:20:48.170 --> 00:20:52.567
So this affair with Else von
Richthofen is really the first

00:20:52.567 --> 00:20:56.509
real fulfilled erotic experience
in Weber's life,

00:20:56.509 --> 00:21:01.151
and has a lot to do,
I think, in Weber's changing

00:21:01.151 --> 00:21:04.730
thinking about life and
modernity--

00:21:04.730 --> 00:21:08.519
the rediscovery of the power of
eroticism.

00:21:08.519 --> 00:21:13.828
Then he has been doing work on
religion.

00:21:13.828 --> 00:21:21.028
This is mainly a response to
criticism he got for his book--

00:21:21.028 --> 00:21:24.337
we will be talking in a minute
about The Protestant

00:21:24.337 --> 00:21:27.586
Ethic--
and he tries to defend his work

00:21:27.586 --> 00:21:32.068
on The Protestant Ethic
by looking at various world

00:21:32.068 --> 00:21:35.592
religions,
and shows that rationalization

00:21:35.592 --> 00:21:40.355
did not take place in these
religions as much as it happened

00:21:40.355 --> 00:21:41.890
in Christianity.
 

00:21:41.890 --> 00:21:45.327
And then he's working on his
opus magnum,

00:21:45.327 --> 00:21:48.859
Economy and Society;
what he never finished.

00:21:48.859 --> 00:21:52.578
Died in 1920.
 

00:21:52.578 --> 00:21:56.400
Well this is Else von
Richthofen, Mrs. Jaffé.

00:21:56.400 --> 00:22:02.778
She came from a very prominent
German family.

00:22:02.778 --> 00:22:07.374
There were three very prominent
and very beautiful Richthofen

00:22:07.374 --> 00:22:08.140
sisters.
 

00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:13.480
As I said, Else was the wife of
Edgar Jaffé.

00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:17.490
Her sister, Frieda von
Richthofen, had a long and very

00:22:17.490 --> 00:22:20.667
passionate relationship,
eventual marriage,

00:22:20.667 --> 00:22:22.558
with D.H. Lawrence.
 

00:22:22.558 --> 00:22:25.832
And probably many of you in
high school have read

00:22:25.832 --> 00:22:28.900
D.H. Lawrence and Sons and
Lovers.

00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:32.369
Sons and Lovers was
inspired by Frieda van

00:22:32.369 --> 00:22:33.308
Richthofen.
 

00:22:33.308 --> 00:22:36.538
It was a very turbulent,
complicated relationship.

00:22:36.538 --> 00:22:42.558
Well this is Weber in
Heidelberg--last time in his

00:22:42.558 --> 00:22:43.420
life.
 

00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:48.450
The early work in Weber was
mainly in antiquity.

00:22:48.450 --> 00:22:52.016
In 1903 and 4,
he writes The Protestant

00:22:52.016 --> 00:22:53.058
Ethic.
 

00:22:53.058 --> 00:22:58.000
Then the big world religions,
China, India and Judaism.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.241
And then finally Economy and
Society, an unfinished

00:23:02.241 --> 00:23:03.210
manuscript.
 

00:23:03.210 --> 00:23:07.259
This is the First Edition of
The Protestant Ethic.

00:23:07.259 --> 00:23:12.368
Well I think I'll probably skip
this one, because I will talk to

00:23:12.368 --> 00:23:15.288
The Protestant Ethic
later.

00:23:15.288 --> 00:23:17.950
Well this is the Weber's house
in Heidelberg.

00:23:17.950 --> 00:23:21.144
As you can see,
University of Heidelberg

00:23:21.144 --> 00:23:24.259
treated their professors quite
nice.

00:23:24.259 --> 00:23:29.378
Well Marianne was running a
salon in this house,

00:23:29.378 --> 00:23:35.480
with an extraordinary
intellectual circle around them.

00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:37.108
This is Marianne Weber.
 

00:23:37.108 --> 00:23:41.410
She was, as I said,
a wonderful woman.

00:23:41.410 --> 00:23:46.818
He was actually a kind of
second-cousin.

00:23:46.818 --> 00:23:53.548
Her grandfather was the brother
of Max Weber's father.

00:23:53.548 --> 00:23:59.519
She was also a formidable
intellectual.

00:23:59.519 --> 00:24:03.775
Her book, Wives and Mothers
in the Evolution of Law,

00:24:03.775 --> 00:24:05.390
was a great success.
 

00:24:05.390 --> 00:24:09.170
Émile Durkheim reviewed
the book.

00:24:09.170 --> 00:24:13.387
And at that time Marianne was
much more famous than Max Weber

00:24:13.387 --> 00:24:13.808
was.
 

00:24:13.808 --> 00:24:19.541
Max turned quite nationalistic,
as many other Germans during

00:24:19.541 --> 00:24:21.680
the First World War.
 

00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:26.788
But then his experiences of the
horrors of the First World War,

00:24:26.788 --> 00:24:30.115
and partially I think the
relationship with Else von

00:24:30.115 --> 00:24:33.652
Richthofen,
turns him from a committed

00:24:33.652 --> 00:24:39.702
liberal who just had nothing
else to say but approving things

00:24:39.702 --> 00:24:43.825
about modernity--
somebody who is called "a

00:24:43.825 --> 00:24:45.650
liberal in despair".
 

00:24:45.650 --> 00:24:48.568
He remains liberal for his life.
 

00:24:48.568 --> 00:24:51.750
He will always say that
capitalism is the only viable

00:24:51.750 --> 00:24:55.480
system we can live in;
modernity has no alternative.

00:24:55.480 --> 00:25:00.640
But he's beginning increasingly
to show the downside of this

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:01.690
modernity.
 

00:25:01.690 --> 00:25:04.288
He said, "I cannot come up
with anything better.

00:25:04.288 --> 00:25:08.026
But it should not prevent me to
see the disenchantment,

00:25:08.026 --> 00:25:10.655
the loss of magic,
in the modern world,

00:25:10.655 --> 00:25:13.838
and the horrors of the modern
world."

00:25:13.838 --> 00:25:17.940
We will talk about this later
on.

00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:23.009
He actually--nationalism had an
impact on him--

00:25:23.009 --> 00:25:27.921
he actually was part of the
delegation at the Versailles

00:25:27.921 --> 00:25:31.875
Peace Treaty,
and he was responsible for

00:25:31.875 --> 00:25:36.930
inserting Article 48 into the
Weimar Constitution,

00:25:36.930 --> 00:25:42.634
which unfortunately was used
for Hitler to gain power in

00:25:42.634 --> 00:25:43.358
1933.
 

00:25:43.358 --> 00:25:47.285
I mean, not that Weber can--
shall be held responsible for

00:25:47.285 --> 00:25:51.210
Nazism, but this is something I
have to share with you.

00:25:51.210 --> 00:25:55.422
Well the last work,
Economy and Society,

00:25:55.422 --> 00:25:59.907
is mainly a theory of
domination, and we will talk

00:25:59.907 --> 00:26:03.480
about next week what domination
is.

00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:08.060
He basically combines power,
which is legitimated,

00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:10.960
as the concept of domination.
 

00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:15.528
And what he does,
he develops a theory of human

00:26:15.528 --> 00:26:20.000
history as subsequent types of
dominations;

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:23.174
a major departure from Marx.
 

00:26:23.174 --> 00:26:23.970
Right?
 

00:26:23.970 --> 00:26:28.275
That social history not
describes subsequent modes of

00:26:28.275 --> 00:26:32.250
production, but different types
of domination.

00:26:32.250 --> 00:26:37.058
Okay, so that was the life and
work of Max Weber.

00:26:37.058 --> 00:26:42.660
And now let's turn into The
Protestant Ethic;

00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:47.900
and try to do this in twenty
minutes, which will not be easy.

00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:50.930
Okay.
 

00:26:50.930 --> 00:27:13.548
 
 

00:27:13.548 --> 00:27:17.844
So this is--as he recovers from
the nervous breakdown,

00:27:17.844 --> 00:27:22.787
his first major book is The
Protestant Ethic and the Spirit

00:27:22.787 --> 00:27:24.568
of Capitalism.
 

00:27:24.568 --> 00:27:27.338
And that's in many ways a major
departure.

00:27:27.338 --> 00:27:32.299
Before the nervous breakdown,
Weber is an enthusiast

00:27:32.299 --> 00:27:35.509
pro-capitalist and pro-liberal.
 

00:27:35.509 --> 00:27:42.106
His major concern before 1897
is what blocks the development

00:27:42.106 --> 00:27:47.798
in the eastern part of Germany,
and how those forces which

00:27:47.798 --> 00:27:51.650
block the development of
capitalism can be overcome.

00:27:51.650 --> 00:27:56.353
He's very much a liberal in the
sense of Adam Smith and John

00:27:56.353 --> 00:27:57.470
Stuart Mill.
 

00:27:57.470 --> 00:28:01.244
Then he has his nervous
breakdown, and the person who is

00:28:01.244 --> 00:28:05.019
emerging looks like a person who
has been thinking about

00:28:05.019 --> 00:28:07.944
Nietzsche--
right?--by staring ahead of

00:28:07.944 --> 00:28:11.314
himself a great deal,
and that's beginning to show

00:28:11.314 --> 00:28:13.818
already in The Protestant
Ethic.

00:28:13.818 --> 00:28:19.690
Well he was working at a time
when Marxism was the dominant

00:28:19.690 --> 00:28:22.930
intellectual force in Germany.
 

00:28:22.930 --> 00:28:28.125
The Social Democratic Party in
Germany was gaining ground and

00:28:28.125 --> 00:28:32.890
beginning to do extremely
well--at elections as well.

00:28:32.890 --> 00:28:35.435
And therefore,
in my reading,

00:28:35.435 --> 00:28:40.621
Max Weber's project is to
challenge Marxism in fundamental

00:28:40.621 --> 00:28:41.440
ways.
 

00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:46.814
And The Protestant Ethic
is a first and major step in the

00:28:46.814 --> 00:28:49.630
direction to challenge Marxism.
 

00:28:49.630 --> 00:28:52.759
So what is the Marx-Weber
debate?

00:28:52.759 --> 00:28:57.395
If you are interested in it,
I will teach a seminar next

00:28:57.395 --> 00:29:01.190
semester which will only deal
with this slide,

00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:04.308
what I am presenting here to
you.

00:29:04.308 --> 00:29:09.180
But you will be asked to read a
lot of text from Marx and Weber.

00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:16.037
Well historical
materialism--right?--suggests

00:29:16.037 --> 00:29:24.608
that it's only economic forces
which explain history.

00:29:24.608 --> 00:29:30.000
Weber said, "Look,
ideas matter too.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:35.444
You cannot deduce ideas and
cultural features from economic

00:29:35.444 --> 00:29:37.230
conditions."
 

00:29:37.230 --> 00:29:42.586
Also, Marx has no problem what
motivates human beings:

00:29:42.586 --> 00:29:45.720
survival, economic interests.
 

00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:49.940
Weber said, "No,
we are not only motivated by

00:29:49.940 --> 00:29:53.644
economic interests,
we are also motivated by

00:29:53.644 --> 00:29:56.541
tradition;
we can be motivated by

00:29:56.541 --> 00:29:57.618
values."
 

00:29:57.618 --> 00:30:02.788
He has a more complex notion of
human motivation.

00:30:02.788 --> 00:30:06.656
Then, as I mentioned,
history cannot be described as

00:30:06.656 --> 00:30:09.160
subsequent modes of production.
 

00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:13.230
What changes is the nature of
power;

00:30:13.230 --> 00:30:15.410
the different type of
motivation.

00:30:15.410 --> 00:30:18.970
What changes from time to time
historically,

00:30:18.970 --> 00:30:23.180
how people, in position of
power, what kind of claims do

00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:26.307
they make for you to obey,
and how you

00:30:26.307 --> 00:30:29.776
internalize--right?--the
principles of your

00:30:29.776 --> 00:30:31.180
subordination.
 

00:30:31.180 --> 00:30:36.276
And he develops these different
types of authorities.

00:30:36.276 --> 00:30:37.058
Right?
 

00:30:37.058 --> 00:30:40.483
Three major types:
traditional authority,

00:30:40.483 --> 00:30:44.851
charismatic authority,
and put it liberal authority,

00:30:44.851 --> 00:30:47.420
legal- rational authority.
 

00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:51.963
This is his somewhat awkward
term to describe the liberal

00:30:51.963 --> 00:30:55.210
system, what we would call
liberalism.

00:30:55.210 --> 00:30:57.710
And finally class.
 

00:30:57.710 --> 00:31:01.796
Weber uses the term of class,
but he said they are not

00:31:01.796 --> 00:31:04.364
based--
you should not identify class

00:31:04.364 --> 00:31:07.541
on property relationship,
but on marketplaces,

00:31:07.541 --> 00:31:11.554
and Marx made an error by
believing that class has always

00:31:11.554 --> 00:31:13.130
existed in history.
 

00:31:13.130 --> 00:31:17.423
Class is a new phenomenon which
emerges only with modern

00:31:17.423 --> 00:31:22.450
marketing integrated economies;
market economies.

00:31:22.450 --> 00:31:25.907
All right, what are the major
themes in The Protestant

00:31:25.907 --> 00:31:26.650
Ethic?
 

00:31:26.650 --> 00:31:29.990
He starts with a rather
uninteresting part.

00:31:29.990 --> 00:31:33.753
He offers some empirical
evidence there is a correlation

00:31:33.753 --> 00:31:36.630
between being rich and being
Protestant.

00:31:36.630 --> 00:31:41.078
Well this is no proof of
causality;

00:31:41.078 --> 00:31:44.900
it's a kind of prima facie
evidence, what he does.

00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:47.558
I think that's probably the
weakest part of the book.

00:31:47.558 --> 00:31:50.411
Then he asks the question,
what is the spirit of

00:31:50.411 --> 00:31:51.200
capitalism?
 

00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:53.828
What is the worldview of
capitalism?

00:31:53.828 --> 00:31:57.105
Then he looks at Luther's
conception of calling,

00:31:57.105 --> 00:32:00.868
and what it has to do with the
spirit of capitalism.

00:32:00.868 --> 00:32:05.093
Then he looks at the religious
foundations of worldly,

00:32:05.093 --> 00:32:07.882
"this-worldly
asceticism",

00:32:07.882 --> 00:32:10.990
and how Reformation brings this
by;

00:32:10.990 --> 00:32:15.037
and, in particular,
the interpretation of it in

00:32:15.037 --> 00:32:19.259
Calvinism, and the teaching of
predestination.

00:32:19.259 --> 00:32:23.269
Okay, so these are the crucial
issues.

00:32:23.269 --> 00:32:27.875
So the religious stratification
and affiliation and social

00:32:27.875 --> 00:32:29.250
stratification.
 

00:32:29.250 --> 00:32:32.890
As I said, this is the weaker
part of the book.

00:32:32.890 --> 00:32:37.056
You really should do it,
if you read the whole book,

00:32:37.056 --> 00:32:39.180
as prima facie evidence.
 

00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:40.880
There is something going on
here.

00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:44.053
Look at the data,
and it turns out that

00:32:44.053 --> 00:32:48.310
Protestant countries were
probably ahead of Catholic

00:32:48.310 --> 00:32:50.650
countries in capitalism.
 

00:32:50.650 --> 00:32:55.148
And look at the very wealthy
people, and you will see more

00:32:55.148 --> 00:32:57.358
Protestant than Catholics.
 

00:32:57.358 --> 00:33:00.160
Well not a very forceful
argument.

00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:05.405
He himself is a bit unclear
about this, because he does not

00:33:05.405 --> 00:33:08.118
quite know what causes what.
 

00:33:08.118 --> 00:33:15.223
Is this somehow people,
Protestants inherited more

00:33:15.223 --> 00:33:23.634
wealth, or because they are
Protestant they can create more

00:33:23.634 --> 00:33:25.230
wealth?
 

00:33:25.230 --> 00:33:27.862
But, you know,
if you are looking at American

00:33:27.862 --> 00:33:31.270
history, there is certainly
prima facie evidence for this.

00:33:31.270 --> 00:33:31.868
Right?
 

00:33:31.868 --> 00:33:35.288
Think about nineteenth century
United States.

00:33:35.288 --> 00:33:35.910
Right?
 

00:33:35.910 --> 00:33:40.108
It was WASP:
white, Anglo-Saxon and

00:33:40.108 --> 00:33:41.468
Protestant.
 

00:33:41.468 --> 00:33:42.578
Right?
 

00:33:42.578 --> 00:33:46.009
And then there were the poor
people coming in.

00:33:46.009 --> 00:33:47.390
And who were they were?
 

00:33:47.390 --> 00:33:49.009
The Irish and the Italian.
 

00:33:49.009 --> 00:33:52.059
And what was their religion?
 

00:33:52.059 --> 00:33:53.890
Roman Catholic. Right?
 

00:33:53.890 --> 00:33:57.123
So I think if you are thinking
in nineteenth century,

00:33:57.123 --> 00:34:00.790
late nineteenth-century U.S.,
the kind of empirical evidence

00:34:00.790 --> 00:34:03.028
is, you know,
pretty persuasive.

00:34:03.028 --> 00:34:05.520
But otherwise,
of course, I don't think this

00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:07.259
would stand up for scrutiny.
 

00:34:07.259 --> 00:34:11.480
But I think this is just to
start the argument.

00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:12.849
Now comes the more serious one.
 

00:34:12.849 --> 00:34:14.880
What is the spirit of
capitalism?

00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:18.579
And this is--there are two
important points he makes.

00:34:18.579 --> 00:34:21.804
He says, "What is unique
about capitalism,

00:34:21.804 --> 00:34:26.010
that the greed is turned into
an ethical imperative."

00:34:26.010 --> 00:34:30.204
And the other one is that the
essence of capitalism is

00:34:30.204 --> 00:34:32.579
rationalism and calculation.
 

00:34:32.579 --> 00:34:39.380
Well greed turned into an
ethical imperative.

00:34:39.380 --> 00:34:43.567
A very interesting point,
because as we have seen Marx

00:34:43.567 --> 00:34:47.911
does not offer any explanation
why on earth suddenly the

00:34:47.911 --> 00:34:51.309
capitalists start accumulating
capital.

00:34:51.309 --> 00:34:56.289
Marx does not have a theory to
explain the motivation of

00:34:56.289 --> 00:34:59.460
original accumulation of
capital.

00:34:59.460 --> 00:35:02.875
He only said original
accumulation of capital is a

00:35:02.875 --> 00:35:06.219
kind of theft--right?--and once
you have capital,

00:35:06.219 --> 00:35:08.659
you don't have to assume theft.
 

00:35:08.659 --> 00:35:11.112
But, you know,
the original accumulation comes

00:35:11.112 --> 00:35:12.039
close to theft.
 

00:35:12.039 --> 00:35:15.679
But he does not explain why on
earth people beginning to

00:35:15.679 --> 00:35:17.070
accumulate capital.
 

00:35:17.070 --> 00:35:18.875
And Weber said,
"Well this is

00:35:18.875 --> 00:35:19.969
interesting."
 

00:35:19.969 --> 00:35:23.099
Because in most history,
people like us,

00:35:23.099 --> 00:35:25.650
who are working day and night,
and,

00:35:25.650 --> 00:35:31.349
you know, you put our little
money in 401(k)s or whatever,

00:35:31.349 --> 00:35:33.443
and, you know,
try to put a little money in

00:35:33.443 --> 00:35:34.389
the stock market.
 

00:35:34.389 --> 00:35:37.150
You know, most people,
in most human history,

00:35:37.150 --> 00:35:40.099
they would say,
"These people are jerks.

00:35:40.099 --> 00:35:42.030
Why don't they relax?
 

00:35:42.030 --> 00:35:44.829
Now they have enough to eat,
they should have fun."

00:35:44.829 --> 00:35:48.608
And most of you in this room
will probably never have much

00:35:48.608 --> 00:35:48.873
fun.
 

00:35:48.873 --> 00:35:49.469
Right?
 

00:35:49.469 --> 00:35:52.369
You will be working day and
night to make more money.

00:35:52.369 --> 00:35:53.579
Where does it come from?
 

00:35:53.579 --> 00:35:55.809
He said this is unique for
capitalism.

00:35:55.809 --> 00:35:59.480
This is unique for modernity,
because greed,

00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:03.235
to become rich,
became an ethical imperative.

00:36:03.235 --> 00:36:04.090
Right?
 

00:36:04.090 --> 00:36:05.639
That is the essence.
 

00:36:05.639 --> 00:36:08.534
And he said it has a lot to do
with rationalization of

00:36:08.534 --> 00:36:09.190
modernity.
 

00:36:09.190 --> 00:36:13.452
And we will see it will have a
lot to do with Calvinism,

00:36:13.452 --> 00:36:17.559
and predestination,
and Luther's notion of calling.

00:36:17.559 --> 00:36:26.340
Well this is the point what I
said, right?

00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:30.661
Pre-capitalist man actually
could not understand us.

00:36:30.661 --> 00:36:31.340
Right?
 

00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:34.586
They had to work day and night
because they needed it in order

00:36:34.586 --> 00:36:35.280
to survive.
 

00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:39.318
But once they had enough food
to eat, and they had shelter,

00:36:39.318 --> 00:36:42.382
they were not running after
money any longer.

00:36:42.382 --> 00:36:43.079
Right?
 

00:36:43.079 --> 00:36:45.960
This is something which is
unique for modern man.

00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:51.701
"The capitalist system
needs this devotion to the

00:36:51.701 --> 00:36:54.735
calling to make money."
 

00:36:54.735 --> 00:36:55.710
Right?
 

00:36:55.710 --> 00:37:01.230
It is for us an ethical
imperative.

00:37:01.230 --> 00:37:02.280
You know?
 

00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:04.402
Well to what extent
predestination,

00:37:04.402 --> 00:37:05.340
I don't know.
 

00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:07.550
But if you are very rich you
will say,

00:37:07.550 --> 00:37:08.789
"Well I have to get
richer,

00:37:08.789 --> 00:37:11.239
because I am doing good by
becoming rich,

00:37:11.239 --> 00:37:13.699
because I'm creating jobs for
others.

00:37:13.699 --> 00:37:15.313
What a good person I am."
 

00:37:15.313 --> 00:37:15.690
Right?
 

00:37:15.690 --> 00:37:20.159
That's why you want to become
rich, to be--to create jobs for

00:37:20.159 --> 00:37:20.829
others.
 

00:37:20.829 --> 00:37:26.900
Now calculation--this is
absolutely crucial for Weber.

00:37:26.900 --> 00:37:30.548
He said, "Well capitalism
begins with rational economic

00:37:30.548 --> 00:37:34.570
calculation, which did not exist
before capitalist times."

00:37:34.570 --> 00:37:38.552
Well he kind of departs here
from Adam Smith,

00:37:38.552 --> 00:37:42.989
for whom rational calculation
was always there.

00:37:42.989 --> 00:37:44.659
People were just not rational.
 

00:37:44.659 --> 00:37:48.829
Weber said now this is a
uniquely historical phenomenon,

00:37:48.829 --> 00:37:52.619
that we're beginning to
calculate effort and return

00:37:52.619 --> 00:37:54.590
against to each other.
 

00:37:54.590 --> 00:37:56.750
And we invent double
bookkeeping.

00:37:56.750 --> 00:37:57.289
Right?
 

00:37:57.289 --> 00:38:01.199
This is what we spend in terms
of money and our energy,

00:38:01.199 --> 00:38:04.601
and this is our return,
this is our profit which

00:38:04.601 --> 00:38:05.469
appears.
 

00:38:05.469 --> 00:38:11.284
So rational economic
calculation is the key of our

00:38:11.284 --> 00:38:13.420
capitalist spirit.
 

00:38:13.420 --> 00:38:14.489
Right?
 

00:38:14.489 --> 00:38:15.639
These are the two things.
 

00:38:15.639 --> 00:38:19.311
That in order to work hard and
to make money makes you a good

00:38:19.311 --> 00:38:19.739
person.
 

00:38:19.739 --> 00:38:20.289
Right?
 

00:38:20.289 --> 00:38:24.969
It's an altruistic act that you
can become rich.

00:38:24.969 --> 00:38:27.737
And second, you are capitalist
if you make rational

00:38:27.737 --> 00:38:28.400
bookkeeping.
 

00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:28.900
Right?
 

00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:31.690
If you don't keep,
you know, your incomes and

00:38:31.690 --> 00:38:34.610
expenditures,
you are doing something wrong;

00:38:34.610 --> 00:38:36.150
you are not a real capitalist.
 

00:38:36.150 --> 00:38:36.510
Right?
 

00:38:36.510 --> 00:38:41.228
So in order--keep in mind,
you know, you have to keep your

00:38:41.228 --> 00:38:42.554
checks balanced.
 

00:38:42.554 --> 00:38:43.300
Right?
 

00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:46.369
You always have to know how
much you spend and how much you

00:38:46.369 --> 00:38:46.739
have.
 

00:38:46.739 --> 00:38:51.231
And rationalism--there's a big
tendency for history that we are

00:38:51.231 --> 00:38:53.695
becoming increasingly
rationalized.

00:38:53.695 --> 00:38:54.420
Right?
 

00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:57.376
And he said,
"Only naïve

00:38:57.376 --> 00:39:02.126
historical materialism assumes
that ideas originate as

00:39:02.126 --> 00:39:05.980
reflection of economic
situation."

00:39:05.980 --> 00:39:09.949
He said, "The spirit of
capitalism was present before

00:39:09.949 --> 00:39:11.969
the capitalist order."
 

00:39:11.969 --> 00:39:16.041
You had to invent rationalism
and rational calculation before

00:39:16.041 --> 00:39:19.568
you could have capital
accumulation and capitalism as

00:39:19.568 --> 00:39:20.179
such.
 

00:39:20.179 --> 00:39:24.889
Now here you come,
Luther's conception of calling.

00:39:24.889 --> 00:39:29.829
One very important issue is
this is a this-worldly view.

00:39:29.829 --> 00:39:33.400
It's a big change from Medieval
Catholic theology.

00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:39.911
Luther coined the term
Beruf in translating the

00:39:39.911 --> 00:39:42.369
Bible into German.
 

00:39:42.369 --> 00:39:47.079
And the term Beruf has
multiple meanings.

00:39:47.079 --> 00:39:51.809
In English I think it is quite
well translated as calling;

00:39:51.809 --> 00:39:55.025
though not quite,
because in German Beruf

00:39:55.025 --> 00:39:58.860
has the very pedestrian,
simple meaning of occupation.

00:39:58.860 --> 00:40:01.527
So if you are filling out a
questionnaire,

00:40:01.527 --> 00:40:03.545
a German language
questionnaire,

00:40:03.545 --> 00:40:06.929
for the line 'occupation'
stands 'Beruf'.

00:40:06.929 --> 00:40:09.768
But Beruf is also a call.
 

00:40:09.768 --> 00:40:12.280
Ruf is to call,
in German.

00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:15.916
So Beruf is that
you--God calls you.

00:40:15.916 --> 00:40:16.610
Right?
 

00:40:16.610 --> 00:40:19.579
You got a ruf,
you got a call.

00:40:19.579 --> 00:40:20.239
Right?
 

00:40:20.239 --> 00:40:21.579
God calls you. Right?
 

00:40:21.579 --> 00:40:23.150
You are needed.
 

00:40:23.150 --> 00:40:25.780
You have to do something for
God.

00:40:25.780 --> 00:40:27.349
This is Beruf.
 

00:40:27.349 --> 00:40:29.179
And what is God calling you?
 

00:40:29.179 --> 00:40:31.849
To perform well in your
occupation.

00:40:31.849 --> 00:40:36.887
So while in medieval asceticism
the essence of life was

00:40:36.887 --> 00:40:37.820
afterlife.
 

00:40:37.820 --> 00:40:38.659
Right?
 

00:40:38.659 --> 00:40:42.059
You were a saint when you
withdraw from your life.

00:40:42.059 --> 00:40:43.690
You hardly ate anything.
 

00:40:43.690 --> 00:40:47.452
You become a saint because all
what you eat is an egg a day,

00:40:47.452 --> 00:40:48.856
and you still survive.
 

00:40:48.856 --> 00:40:49.429
Right?
 

00:40:49.429 --> 00:40:53.981
This is sainthood,
in the Medieval Roman Catholic

00:40:53.981 --> 00:40:54.739
sense.
 

00:40:54.739 --> 00:40:57.869
Now this is no good any longer.
 

00:40:57.869 --> 00:41:01.076
Luther said you have to be
active in this life,

00:41:01.076 --> 00:41:02.539
in your occupation.
 

00:41:02.539 --> 00:41:06.646
That's when you are a saint,
not when you withdraw yourself

00:41:06.646 --> 00:41:08.911
from life and wait for
afterlife.

00:41:08.911 --> 00:41:09.619
Right?
 

00:41:09.619 --> 00:41:12.739
This is the big innovation of
Luther and theology.

00:41:12.739 --> 00:41:18.423
Sort of therefore--right?--what
God wants you is to fulfill your

00:41:18.423 --> 00:41:22.960
duties in this world--
right?--rather than to be a

00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:27.362
saint, not to consume,
withdraw, and so on and so

00:41:27.362 --> 00:41:27.980
forth.
 

00:41:27.980 --> 00:41:29.929
Okay.
 

00:41:29.929 --> 00:41:33.679
Now let's move on.
 

00:41:33.679 --> 00:41:36.972
But Luther is also a
traditional theorist,

00:41:36.972 --> 00:41:38.820
and Weber notes that.
 

00:41:38.820 --> 00:41:43.150
In fact, his emphasis on
Beruf means that you have

00:41:43.150 --> 00:41:47.637
to perform in the job what you
have, in the social position

00:41:47.637 --> 00:41:49.030
what you have.
 

00:41:49.030 --> 00:41:51.530
This is not a theory for change.
 

00:41:51.530 --> 00:41:55.280
It is a theory for the
reproduction of the status quo.

00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:59.289
And Luther actually stood up
against the peasant revolutions

00:41:59.289 --> 00:42:03.639
in Germany of his time and sided
with political conservatives.

00:42:03.639 --> 00:42:09.884
And therefore Weber suggests
that this non-dynamic view of

00:42:09.884 --> 00:42:16.458
history made it impossible for
Lutheranism to become the real

00:42:16.458 --> 00:42:21.757
moving force,
and therefore it remained too

00:42:21.757 --> 00:42:25.827
traditionalistic,
and that's why you needed

00:42:25.827 --> 00:42:26.659
Calvinism.
 

00:42:26.659 --> 00:42:29.260
And why Calvinism?
 

00:42:29.260 --> 00:42:33.396
Well the big change in
modernity, that magic is being

00:42:33.396 --> 00:42:34.429
eliminated.
 

00:42:34.429 --> 00:42:36.150
What was magic?
 

00:42:36.150 --> 00:42:40.610
That we have power over God;
we could force God to do

00:42:40.610 --> 00:42:42.139
something for us.
 

00:42:42.139 --> 00:42:42.860
Right?
 

00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:46.882
There were prescriptions what
we do, and these were magical

00:42:46.882 --> 00:42:51.043
means by which you have magic--
you know, the magician comes,

00:42:51.043 --> 00:42:54.498
rain doesn't come;
the magician does its tricks

00:42:54.498 --> 00:42:55.807
and rain will come.
 

00:42:55.807 --> 00:42:56.360
Right?
 

00:42:56.360 --> 00:42:57.940
That's magic.
 

00:42:57.940 --> 00:43:00.684
Now in order to rationalize the
world, you have to get rid of

00:43:00.684 --> 00:43:01.050
magic.
 

00:43:01.050 --> 00:43:03.309
The world becomes rationalized.
 

00:43:03.309 --> 00:43:06.661
You understand where the rain
is coming from,

00:43:06.661 --> 00:43:11.081
and you know there is hardly
anything you can do to make it

00:43:11.081 --> 00:43:11.460
rain.
 

00:43:11.460 --> 00:43:12.300
Right?
 

00:43:12.300 --> 00:43:15.920
So this is elimination of magic.
 

00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:19.090
And this is what you see in a
Calvinist church.

00:43:19.090 --> 00:43:22.567
You walk into the Calvinist
church, they don't have any

00:43:22.567 --> 00:43:26.195
pictures of saints;
you know, it has a coldness of

00:43:26.195 --> 00:43:29.760
rationalism--right?--in a
Presbyterian church.

00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:35.920
And what is the most important
element of Calvinism is the

00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:38.840
theory of predestination.
 

00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:42.909
And that's a very interesting
teaching.

00:43:42.909 --> 00:43:48.684
Calvin assumed--and this is
basically to try radically to

00:43:48.684 --> 00:43:54.213
get rid of any notion of magic--
that in fact whether you will

00:43:54.213 --> 00:43:58.329
be saved or you perish was
decided upon your birth by God;

00:43:58.329 --> 00:44:00.469
there is nothing you can do
about this.

00:44:00.469 --> 00:44:04.219
So therefore,
you know, in Medieval Roman

00:44:04.219 --> 00:44:10.030
Catholic churches this is what
Luther was revolting against.

00:44:10.030 --> 00:44:14.574
Unfortunately there were some
corrupt Roman Catholic priests

00:44:14.574 --> 00:44:17.039
who said, "You know what?
 

00:44:17.039 --> 00:44:20.041
Give me a little money,
and if you give me money,

00:44:20.041 --> 00:44:23.353
then you will go to heaven,
rather than to hell."

00:44:23.353 --> 00:44:23.980
Right?
 

00:44:23.980 --> 00:44:29.320
So people could buy their way
into salvation.

00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:31.690
Now Calvin said, "No way.
 

00:44:31.690 --> 00:44:32.900
You can't do anything."
 

00:44:32.900 --> 00:44:35.844
Not only not giving money to
the priest, which was obviously

00:44:35.844 --> 00:44:37.989
corrupt and the church never
approved it;

00:44:37.989 --> 00:44:42.170
it was just kind of corrupt
practices of individuals.

00:44:42.170 --> 00:44:44.782
But he said,
"There is nothing you can

00:44:44.782 --> 00:44:48.018
do in life, because it has been
predestined."

00:44:48.018 --> 00:44:52.740
The big question is how on
earth this teaching actually can

00:44:52.740 --> 00:44:55.590
create the Protestant work
ethic?

00:44:55.590 --> 00:44:59.987
Why do we work hard,
if it has been decided,

00:44:59.987 --> 00:45:04.181
pre-decided,
before us that we will perish

00:45:04.181 --> 00:45:06.329
or will be saved?
 

00:45:06.329 --> 00:45:14.507
Well this will come out
actually from the preachings of

00:45:14.507 --> 00:45:19.327
Calvinist ministers;
actual practices,

00:45:19.327 --> 00:45:21.079
pastoral practices.
 

00:45:21.079 --> 00:45:23.518
They said, "Well,
you know,

00:45:23.518 --> 00:45:25.181
you are--"
Well this is a town of

00:45:25.181 --> 00:45:27.240
Puritanism,
that was really a

00:45:27.240 --> 00:45:30.019
place-right?--of predestination.
 

00:45:30.019 --> 00:45:37.929
New Haven was created by them.
 

00:45:37.929 --> 00:45:39.900
You start teaching.
 

00:45:39.900 --> 00:45:42.318
Then you will say,
"Well are you concerned

00:45:42.318 --> 00:45:44.159
whether you go to hell or
heaven?

00:45:44.159 --> 00:45:46.057
You are, aren't you?"
 

00:45:46.057 --> 00:45:46.570
Right?
 

00:45:46.570 --> 00:45:49.090
You don't want to burn all your
life.

00:45:49.090 --> 00:45:50.929
You want to know whether you go
to heaven.

00:45:50.929 --> 00:45:53.510
Well there is one way to do it.
 

00:45:53.510 --> 00:45:56.581
Work hard, and if your work
will be rewarded,

00:45:56.581 --> 00:46:00.490
this will be a sign that God
loves you and you will go to

00:46:00.490 --> 00:46:01.260
heaven.
 

00:46:01.260 --> 00:46:03.268
So therefore you are working
hard,

00:46:03.268 --> 00:46:06.610
not in order to buy your way
into heaven,

00:46:06.610 --> 00:46:10.092
but in order to have the sign
of God that you are on the right

00:46:10.092 --> 00:46:12.320
trajectory and you will go to
heaven.

00:46:12.320 --> 00:46:16.860
Well he said unfortunately this
Protestant ethic to work hard,

00:46:16.860 --> 00:46:20.539
to save--Benjamin Franklin,
he said,

00:46:20.539 --> 00:46:24.626
"Benjamin Franklin"--
right?--"you are gone in

00:46:24.626 --> 00:46:27.030
modern capitalism."
 

00:46:27.030 --> 00:46:33.128
Because now--the Puritans,
you know, wanted you to work

00:46:33.128 --> 00:46:33.920
hard.
 

00:46:33.920 --> 00:46:35.389
Now this is all gone.
 

00:46:35.389 --> 00:46:39.846
And what was created actually
we are in "an iron

00:46:39.846 --> 00:46:40.960
cage."
 

00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:42.829
This is a famous quotation.
 

00:46:42.829 --> 00:46:45.994
Again, you have to take it down;
one of the most frequently

00:46:45.994 --> 00:46:47.789
cited sentences from Weber.
 

00:46:47.789 --> 00:46:52.710
"Modernity created an iron
cage where we are actually

00:46:52.710 --> 00:46:57.630
working, because we are forced
to work very hard."

00:46:57.630 --> 00:47:01.030
And the spirit of capitalism
today--

00:47:01.030 --> 00:47:05.695
I think he was reading Veblen
and the theory of the leisure

00:47:05.695 --> 00:47:08.460
class,
and looking at American

00:47:08.460 --> 00:47:12.190
wealthy, by the early twentieth
century,

00:47:12.190 --> 00:47:17.409
who started to have a good
life, not only to save.

00:47:17.409 --> 00:47:22.797
They would not follow any
longer Benjamin Franklin's

00:47:22.797 --> 00:47:27.340
advice: Get up early when the
sun rises,

00:47:27.340 --> 00:47:31.324
and go to bed when the sun
sets, because you don't want to

00:47:31.324 --> 00:47:35.449
burn the candle and waste money
on the candle when you burn.

00:47:35.449 --> 00:47:36.150
Right?
 

00:47:36.150 --> 00:47:40.949
That was the
real--right?--Puritan spirit;

00:47:40.949 --> 00:47:45.038
the spirit which created this
very institution,

00:47:45.038 --> 00:47:46.460
Yale University.
 

00:47:46.460 --> 00:47:47.260
Right?
 

00:47:47.260 --> 00:47:50.322
Don't burn your
candles--right?--because you

00:47:50.322 --> 00:47:51.320
waste money.
 

00:47:51.320 --> 00:47:54.838
Save money;
that's what will please God,

00:47:54.838 --> 00:47:58.800
and that's what will be the
sign that you have been saved.

00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:03.563
Now he said this is
unfortunately not any longer,

00:48:03.563 --> 00:48:08.230
because people are actually are
for consumption,

00:48:08.230 --> 00:48:11.010
conspicuous consumption.
 

00:48:11.010 --> 00:48:17.329
Well and then he ends up--this
is a very important quotation;

00:48:17.329 --> 00:48:22.440
keep it and it will be helpful
for you to understand the

00:48:22.440 --> 00:48:26.900
importance difference between
Marx and Weber--

00:48:26.900 --> 00:48:29.570
he said, "Look,
but don't misunderstand me.

00:48:29.570 --> 00:48:33.489
I don't want to substitute a
one-sided materialist

00:48:33.489 --> 00:48:36.690
explanation of history,
what Marx offers,

00:48:36.690 --> 00:48:39.730
with a one-sided idealist
history.

00:48:39.730 --> 00:48:44.181
I'm not suggesting that
capitalism came out of

00:48:44.181 --> 00:48:45.369
Calvinism.
 

00:48:45.369 --> 00:48:49.701
All what I'm suggesting,
there has been an independent

00:48:49.701 --> 00:48:54.521
change in theological teaching,
from Medieval Catholicism to

00:48:54.521 --> 00:48:55.829
Reformation.
 

00:48:55.829 --> 00:48:59.378
It was a rationalization of
religious thinking:

00:48:59.378 --> 00:49:02.000
the loss of magic,
the rationalism,

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:04.699
the teaching of predestination.
 

00:49:04.699 --> 00:49:08.219
And if this would not have
happened, capitalist

00:49:08.219 --> 00:49:12.579
institutions would not have been
able to develop."

00:49:12.579 --> 00:49:15.838
Not that they caused the
emergence of capitalist

00:49:15.838 --> 00:49:19.152
institutions;
there was also an evolution of

00:49:19.152 --> 00:49:20.820
the economic systems.
 

00:49:20.820 --> 00:49:26.175
The material change happened in
one line, and the change in the

00:49:26.175 --> 00:49:29.889
sphere of ideas happened in
another line.

00:49:29.889 --> 00:49:32.112
And what he said,
"There is an elective

00:49:32.112 --> 00:49:33.820
affinity between the two."
 

00:49:33.820 --> 00:49:37.697
If you have the proper ideas,
and the proper economic

00:49:37.697 --> 00:49:41.800
institution, bingo--right?--
then the change happens;

00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:43.639
then you have modern capitalism.
 

00:49:43.639 --> 00:49:48.500
If you don't have the right
ideas, like Calvinism--

00:49:48.500 --> 00:49:52.929
he said, "Like in China in
the twelfth century everybody,

00:49:52.929 --> 00:49:55.550
everything was ready for
capitalism.

00:49:55.550 --> 00:50:00.260
It did not happen because the
Confucian and Taoist ideas at

00:50:00.260 --> 00:50:04.891
that time did not give the
ideological framing which would

00:50:04.891 --> 00:50:09.440
have helped the development of
capitalism in China,

00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:12.500
and that's why China was held
back." Right?

00:50:12.500 --> 00:50:15.344
Calvinism, you know,
rationalization of ideas could

00:50:15.344 --> 00:50:18.190
happen, but if there are no
economic conditions for

00:50:18.190 --> 00:50:20.579
capitalism, it will not happen
either.

00:50:20.579 --> 00:50:22.880
So this is the idea of elective
affinity.

00:50:22.880 --> 00:50:27.452
He rejects a simple causal
relationship between ideas and

00:50:27.452 --> 00:50:30.882
material conditions,
and he substitutes it,

00:50:30.882 --> 00:50:34.230
we would say today,
an interactive effect.

00:50:34.230 --> 00:50:35.210
Right?
 

00:50:35.210 --> 00:50:39.219
There is an interaction between
ideas and material conditions.

00:50:39.219 --> 00:50:44.670
He calls it elective affinity,
as such.

00:50:44.670 --> 00:50:46.090
Thank you very much.
 

00:50:46.090 --> 00:51:00.230
 
 

00:51:00.230 --> 00:51:05.389
And the test questions will be
posted, just before 7:00 p.m.

00:51:05.389 --> 00:51:07.260
I have a discussion section at
7:00.

00:51:07.260 --> 00:51:11.230
So before I go to the
discussion section Thursday,

00:51:11.230 --> 00:51:13.500
I will post the questions.
 

00:51:13.500 --> 00:51:19.000

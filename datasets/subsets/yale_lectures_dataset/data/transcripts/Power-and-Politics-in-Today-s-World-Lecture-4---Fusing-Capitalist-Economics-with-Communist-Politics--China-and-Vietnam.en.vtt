00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:09.693
- So today's agenda,

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:15.033
we're gonna start with why am
I talking China and Vietnam.

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.140
We're then gonna talk
about reform in China

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.950
in the period leading up
to the 4th of June, 1989

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:27.333
which is the Tiananmen Square massacre.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.980
We'll then talk about
Tiananmen in the 1990s

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.860
that will lead us into a
discussion of what I'm calling

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.580
the sequencing debate of
political and economic reform.

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:41.730
Once it was clear

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.730
that communism was gonna
be replaced by capitalism,

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:47.770
there was a huge debate about,

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:51.590
well, is it better to have
political reform first

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:53.550
or economic reform first.

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.300
We'll try to do them together

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.930
and we'll talk about
that sequencing debate

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.420
which will lead us into
a larger discussion

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.830
of what since the 1950s

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.630
has been known as modernization theory.

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.720
The thesis that economic modernization

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.180
will eventually produce demand for

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.670
and the establishment of democracy

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.513
and that will then leave us
to think about the future.

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.383
So, China and Vietnam Today.

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.160
- [Narrator] China so far
has built the equivalent

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.740
of Europe's entire housing
stock in just 15 years.

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.730
In November 2015, Beijing
replaced the substantially larger

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:42.730
1300 ton Sanyuan Bridge in just 43 hours.

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.490
Between 1996 and 2016,

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.550
China has built 2.6 million miles of roads

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.280
including 70,000 miles of highways

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.430
connecting 95% of the country's villages

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.840
and overtaking the US as the country

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.550
with the most extensive
highway system by almost 50%.

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:03.990
Over the past decade,

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.150
China has constructed the world's longest

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:07.720
high speed rail network.

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.250
12,000 miles of rail lines

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.440
that carry passengers between cities,

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.520
at speeds up to 180 miles per hour.

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.020
China now has more high speed rail tracks

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.040
than the rest of the world combined.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.490
- So that's one of any
number of video clips

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:27.520
one could pick to just give a snapshot

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:32.520
of the incredible transformation
of the Chinese economy

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.310
over the last couple of decades

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.880
and indeed, over the last decade,

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.120
I went to Beijing last
year for the first time

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.870
in about 12 years

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.063
and 12 years ago,

00:02:48.288 --> 00:02:53.288
there were lots of
potholes in the streets,

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.000
there was still rickshaws on the highways.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.240
You go to Beijing today,

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.970
it's just miles and miles of skyscrapers

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.970
and every conceivable
multinational is there.

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:20.120
It looks like just West Los
Angeles times a hundred.

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.420
So you can't overstate

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.290
and I will put some statistics
up in a little while,

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:32.290
but the economic explosion in China

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:37.670
since the 1970s has been phenomenal.

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:42.183
And then here's another
snapshot versus Vietnam.

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.500
- If you're talking about the 80s

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:47.873
what Vietnam look like.

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:50.580
You go to cities,

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:54.720
you didn't see the light, electricity cut,

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.770
no car in the street.

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:00.083
Vietnam was so isolated from the world.

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.760
- [Narrator] With the Doi
Moi economic reforms of 1986,

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.500
the government hoped to move toward

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.090
what is now called a
socialist-oriented market economy.

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:14.110
When the Vietnamese government
asked for hands-on advice,

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:17.025
the IMF did not refuse the call.

00:04:17.025 --> 00:04:20.942
(speaking in foreign language)

00:04:27.726 --> 00:04:31.570
- If you use the analogy
of Vietnam's economy

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:33.763
as a eagle flying up,

00:04:36.633 --> 00:04:37.950
there are two wings.

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:40.957
One is internal institutional reform,

00:04:40.957 --> 00:04:43.363
and the other is opening to trade.

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:46.780
- [Narrator] Free to
start their own companies,

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:47.820
the Vietnamese people

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.460
created more than 30,000
private businesses

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.200
in the first 10 years,

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:56.150
spurring growth that averaged
7% throughout the 1990s.

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:00.110
- If you look back in the
late 80s and early 90s

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:03.860
we had the first FDI law ever

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:08.890
which opened up the opportunity

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:12.070
for newly established private firms

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:14.580
to engage international trade.

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:17.560
- And that was complemented
with a major push

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:21.163
to attract foreign direct
investment into Vietnam.

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:24.740
- [Narrator] The economy has
grown at about 7% per year

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:28.453
since 1990, second globally only to China.

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:34.570
- So these are the two
most successful examples

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:38.430
of post communist systems

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:40.330
that have remained authoritarian

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:44.670
but have been transforming their economies

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:48.280
into capitalist arrangements.

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:52.070
And that differentiates them

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:55.210
from the other post-communist systems

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:58.030
that have retained authoritarian rule

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:00.240
if we think about North Korea,

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.360
or we think about Cuba,

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:06.090
they have not transformed their economies.

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:10.670
So this is one thing
that differentiates them

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:15.670
from the other post-communist
authoritarian systems,

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:18.710
post-communist economies

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:23.200
retaining communist
authoritarian political systems.

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:26.440
And they account for a large part

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:31.440
of the economic success in
the world in the last decade

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.860
just to take one or two decades.

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:37.883
Just to take one example,

00:06:41.234 --> 00:06:44.280
one of the encouraging stories of our time

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:47.283
is if you if you take
the long view of things,

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.590
number of people and even the
percentage of the population

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:56.620
both living in extreme poverty

00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:01.560
has really gone down over
the past two centuries

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:06.560
and much of that decline has
come in the last few decades.

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:12.053
Of course, this is a worldwide indicator.

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:16.140
But if you look at what is accounting

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:17.980
for most of this decline,

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:22.840
you can see that the main
action has been in East Asia.

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:27.840
So the this is the blue
line up here where poverty

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:29.340
again, this is number of people

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:32.980
living on a less than $1.25 a day,

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:37.410
which is a World Bank's
definition of extreme poverty.

00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:40.020
So, most of the changes of course,

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:42.270
have come in the developing world.

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:47.073
But if you compare East
Asia, for example, to Africa,

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:52.030
East Asia is by far the lion's share

00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:56.000
of the reduction in extreme poverty.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.640
Now of course, not all of that
is the is China and Vietnam.

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:03.600
There're countries like South Korea

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:07.490
that have massively improved.

00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:11.700
There are other countries
in that part of the world

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:14.010
not to mention Singapore,

00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:17.470
where poverty rates have
decreased massively.

00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:20.380
Nonetheless, China and Vietnam

00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:25.380
are relatively impressive
stories on this front as well.

00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:30.140
This is a picture of reductions
in poverty in Vietnam

00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:33.340
and if I'd had gone back before 2010,

00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:36.650
the numbers would have been
higher up there as well.

00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:37.670
But you can see,

00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:41.730
even in this last difficult decade,

00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:44.130
and despite the fact
that ethnic minorities

00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:49.030
within Vietnam are not
doing as well as as others,

00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:52.500
we're seeing very low rates of people

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:55.840
living in poverty in Vietnam.

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:58.700
China, you can see

00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:04.830
the head count living below
the official poverty line

00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:07.200
is the red line.

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:12.200
The head count below 1.9 US
dollars a day is the green line.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.220
Again, you can see massive
reductions in poverty

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:22.850
by many estimates they vary,

00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:27.850
but many estimates say that
since the reforms in China

00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:32.293
ushered in in the late 1970s,

00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:37.400
somewhere between 400 million
and half a billion people

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:39.493
have moved out of poverty.

00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:44.160
Now, there's another line on this chart,

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:45.610
which I don't believe,

00:09:45.610 --> 00:09:47.250
which is the Gini coefficient

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:51.130
which is a measure of inequality

00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:56.010
and I believe that the inequality in China

00:09:56.010 --> 00:09:57.990
has gone up a good deal more.

00:09:57.990 --> 00:10:01.560
If you look at here,

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:04.540
this is comparing the
top and bottom quintile.

00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:08.960
But again, this is data provided
by the Chinese government,

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:12.920
you can see that in terms
of per capita income,

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:15.830
they're showing an increase inequality

00:10:15.830 --> 00:10:19.510
from three times to about eight times

00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:25.100
and land and consumption,
less of a change.

00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:28.743
So I would just say two
things about these statistics,

00:10:31.658 --> 00:10:35.100
these are based on Chinese
government statistics.

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:40.100
My guess is that the inequality
in Chinese is a lot higher,

00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:43.630
and particularly this
is comparing quintiles

00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:45.570
that's the top 20%.

00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:47.160
But just as in the US,

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:50.350
and just as in many other
capitalist countries

00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:52.740
that we'll talk about later in the course,

00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:54.130
if you look at the top 5%,

00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:57.313
the top 1%, or the top .1%,

00:10:58.199 --> 00:11:02.370
you're gonna see massive
increases in inequality

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:05.070
and that puts on the table a dilemma

00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:06.960
that's gonna be worth thinking about

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:09.290
as we progress through the course

00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:11.570
and talk about some other countries.

00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:16.570
Which is that while
inequality within countries

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:19.860
just about anywhere in the world

00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:23.280
has gone up over the last four decades,

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:26.980
worldwide, global inequality
has actually come down,

00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:29.080
and the number of people living in poverty

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:32.850
has come down dramatically as we've seen.

00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:36.300
But if you read say the Millennium Goals

00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:38.970
or you go to the World
Economic Forum meetings,

00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:41.790
which I have done from time to time,

00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:44.310
you'll see politician after politician

00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:46.830
and policy wonk after policy wonk

00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:48.807
standing there saying,

00:11:48.807 --> 00:11:52.590
"We need policies to reduce
poverty and inequality."

00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:54.170
It's like almost one word,

00:11:54.170 --> 00:11:56.800
poverty and inequality is one word,

00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:59.550
but what we're seeing here

00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:03.020
is something that' gonna come
back to us in multiple ways

00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:04.620
during the course.

00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:08.490
It's not obvious that all
good things go together.

00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:10.300
And it may well be the case

00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:13.863
that the price of reducing inequality,

00:12:14.922 --> 00:12:17.200
the price of reducing poverty

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:22.200
is tolerating significant
increases in inequality,

00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:24.660
we'll have to think about those trade offs

00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:26.430
in various settings.

00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:29.930
In any event in both China and in Vietnam,

00:12:29.930 --> 00:12:33.933
you've seen massive decreases in poverty,

00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:36.710
big increases inequality

00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:40.810
in not as high by most measures in Vietnam

00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:42.340
again, now it's hard to know

00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:46.020
what statistics to
believe on these matters

00:12:47.197 --> 00:12:50.760
but most scholars seem to
think there's less inequality

00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:53.520
in Vietnam than in China.

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:55.160
So the first answer

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:57.440
why are we talking about
China and Vietnam today

00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:00.460
is that by virtually any measure

00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:02.673
they have been economically successful.

00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:08.670
But then the second and in some
ways more interesting reason

00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:10.370
we're gonna look at them is

00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:14.430
they challenge a lot of accepted
wisdom about capitalism,

00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:17.470
democracy and the relations between them

00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:19.310
because here we have two

00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:22.470
very repressive authoritarian systems,

00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:24.300
transforming their economies

00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:27.300
into successful capitalist ones.

00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:31.540
So that's the puzzle we're
gonna be wrestling with

00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:34.910
for the rest of today's class

00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:38.150
in one form or another.

00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:43.150
So let's think about what
was happening in China

00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:45.053
before Tiananmen.

00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:51.540
After Mao's death in 1978,

00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:55.870
things were gonna change very rapidly,

00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:57.310
just to give you a sense,

00:13:57.310 --> 00:14:01.010
up until the end of the
Cultural Revolution in China,

00:14:01.010 --> 00:14:05.180
this is a picture comparing
Chinese and Japanese

00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:07.020
per capita GDP.

00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:08.300
And as you can see,

00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:12.290
this is a period of
explosive economic growth

00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:14.510
in Japan after World War Two,

00:14:14.510 --> 00:14:17.420
of course, from a very low base

00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:20.253
because the whole economy
had been destroyed.

00:14:21.410 --> 00:14:23.740
When people talk about
the Japanese miracle,

00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:25.300
it's a little bit misleading.

00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:27.320
If we took this back to 1925,

00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:31.860
this line would have come down

00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:35.403
because of the collapse
produced during the war.

00:14:36.650 --> 00:14:39.020
It's a recreation to some degree

00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:41.820
of what it existed before the war,

00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:43.820
but nothing like the levels

00:14:46.215 --> 00:14:48.980
that were seen in years afterward.

00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:50.130
But as you can see,

00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:53.960
per capita GDP in China
was basically flat.

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:58.093
There was no economic
development to speak of.

00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:02.390
1978 Mao is now dead.

00:15:02.390 --> 00:15:06.990
The third plenum of the Communist
Party Central Committee,

00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:11.750
led vice premier soon to
be premier, Deng Xiaoping

00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:16.750
calls for officials to start
liberating their thinking,

00:15:16.930 --> 00:15:19.203
to start seeking truth from facts.

00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:25.050
An ironic statement perhaps

00:15:25.050 --> 00:15:28.400
in light of our own
discussions of fake news

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:32.870
and manipulation of the truth
that we're coping with today,

00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:37.720
but to innovate and
experiment in the economy,

00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:41.650
and officials were instructed,

00:15:41.650 --> 00:15:44.000
this is when they started,

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.800
China had been very
closed and inward looking

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:50.930
and they began going in
large numbers abroad,

00:15:50.930 --> 00:15:54.720
they started applying for courses

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:59.720
at places like MIT business school,

00:16:00.250 --> 00:16:04.210
they started trying to learn
from other development models

00:16:04.210 --> 00:16:06.660
and this is gonna be the beginning

00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:11.660
of experimentation with
new forms of capitalism.

00:16:11.810 --> 00:16:13.130
This is also when

00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:18.560
the big special economic
zones in China were created,

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:23.560
these massive islands of
experimenting with capitalism,

00:16:26.070 --> 00:16:26.903
if you like,

00:16:26.903 --> 00:16:29.750
most of the world's special economic zones

00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:32.380
and we'll talk a bit more about them

00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:33.980
in other countries later

00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:37.200
are sort of industrial parks.

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:41.170
They are 40 or 50 firms,

00:16:41.170 --> 00:16:43.790
they get some preferential tax treatment

00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:47.130
and the idea is to
attract foreign capital.

00:16:47.130 --> 00:16:50.870
The ones being set up
in China were enormous,

00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:55.870
they were sort of giant
cities with schools and shops

00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:59.580
and people lived in them
in their entire lives.

00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:04.160
So the idea was to experiment
with capitalist economics

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:07.240
in self contained ways.

00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:09.630
This is also when they start opening up

00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:11.800
to foreign direct investment.

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:15.550
This is when companies
like Cummins truck engines

00:17:15.550 --> 00:17:16.430
come to China,

00:17:16.430 --> 00:17:19.550
one of the biggest
multinationals in China today

00:17:19.550 --> 00:17:24.550
started in the in the
late 1970s, early 1980s.

00:17:26.710 --> 00:17:28.730
And so this seemed to be

00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:31.580
a little bit like the Prague Spring.

00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:35.830
And indeed, in the late 1970s,

00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:39.020
people started talking
about the Beijing spring

00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:42.840
and there was much more criticism

00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:45.770
of the government tolerated,

00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:48.480
people started publishing

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:51.520
things that you would have
been thrown in prison for

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:55.210
five years or even three years earlier,

00:17:55.210 --> 00:17:57.850
and there was something of a thaw,

00:17:57.850 --> 00:18:00.490
there was something
called the Democracy Wall

00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:04.597
in the Shidong district
of Beijing was created,

00:18:04.597 --> 00:18:08.230
a kind of graffiti wall if you like

00:18:08.230 --> 00:18:12.960
on which people published
criticisms of the government,

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:17.720
but the vast majority of
the political criticism

00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:19.590
was backward looking.

00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:22.310
It was criticism of the
Cultural Revolution,

00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:23.960
criticism of Mao,

00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:26.470
criticism of what had
been done in the past,

00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:29.513
mistakes that had been made in the past.

00:18:30.370 --> 00:18:31.463
And of course,

00:18:32.890 --> 00:18:34.840
that wasn't gonna stay that way

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:36.893
and so before long,

00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:41.330
the Democracy Wall protesters

00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:46.330
started shifting their attention
from attacking the past

00:18:48.550 --> 00:18:52.203
to attacking the current
leadership in China.

00:18:54.704 --> 00:18:57.410
Again, a lot of demands
now for more democracy.

00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:07.500
Wei Jinsheng was a protester who came out

00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:12.400
and made very strong
criticisms of the government

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:17.400
and this went on until
late 1980s, early 1981

00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:23.250
and then there was a lot of
pushback from the regime.

00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:25.930
And so much of the 1980s

00:19:25.930 --> 00:19:30.260
were this era of testing,
political testing,

00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:31.670
by student movements,

00:19:31.670 --> 00:19:33.320
there were reorganization

00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:38.040
of student groups on Chinese campuses,

00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:43.040
there was a lot of
criticism of the government

00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:46.830
interspersed with pushback.

00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:50.130
So Deng, came out and made very clear

00:19:50.130 --> 00:19:54.260
that when he was talking about
experimentation with reform,

00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:56.450
he was talking about economic reform,

00:19:56.450 --> 00:20:00.540
he was not talking about
reforming the political system

00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:03.750
and he reaffirmed what
he called party rule

00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:05.113
and the socialist path.

00:20:06.030 --> 00:20:07.950
He focused on technical questions.

00:20:07.950 --> 00:20:12.540
His four modernizations
had to do with agriculture,

00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:16.010
the industrial economy, the military,

00:20:16.010 --> 00:20:19.930
and technology, technological innovation.

00:20:19.930 --> 00:20:24.930
They started attacking what
they called Spiritual Pollution.

00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:30.740
There was an anti-Spiritual
Pollution campaign in 1983,

00:20:30.910 --> 00:20:33.280
and there was an
anti-Bourgeois Liberalization

00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:34.673
campaign in 1987.

00:20:36.010 --> 00:20:41.010
And Hu-Yaobang who had been a member

00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:42.720
of the Central Committee,

00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:46.653
who had been one of the
most energetic reformers

00:20:46.653 --> 00:20:49.200
was actually fired

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:52.280
from the Central Committee
of the Communist Party.

00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:55.770
So it was this period of back and forth,

00:20:55.770 --> 00:21:00.473
but a lot of growing protests
nonetheless, in the 1980s.

00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:04.610
And it was also a time

00:21:04.610 --> 00:21:07.120
when the economy wasn't doing that well,

00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:10.270
particularly for consumers in urban areas,

00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:12.680
we saw a lot of inflation

00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:16.350
and that led to austerity programs,

00:21:16.350 --> 00:21:19.530
cutbacks on spending by the government,

00:21:19.530 --> 00:21:23.840
which produced further
escalation of protests

00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:28.140
although the economic reforms continued.

00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:32.020
So if you look at foreign
direct investment in China,

00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:35.450
you can see it's very low there,

00:21:35.450 --> 00:21:40.177
but it's going to accelerate
dramatically over the 1990s.

00:21:43.850 --> 00:21:48.850
So then, in 1989,

00:21:49.050 --> 00:21:51.530
in the summer of 1989,

00:21:51.530 --> 00:21:53.313
if somebody had said,

00:21:55.107 --> 00:21:58.410
"Where is there gonna
be political reform?"

00:21:58.410 --> 00:22:00.650
It would have been a pretty good bet

00:22:00.650 --> 00:22:03.360
especially given what was
going on Eastern Europe,

00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:05.880
it would have been a pretty good bet

00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:09.740
that there was gonna be
significant reform In China,

00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:11.530
the student groups were active

00:22:11.530 --> 00:22:16.253
just as in many European countries.

00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:20.240
And this erupts in June 1989
- Hundreds of thousands

00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:22.850
of people here in Tiananmen Square

00:22:22.850 --> 00:22:26.240
perhaps as many as a half
a million, even more.

00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:28.130
In the history of Communist China

00:22:28.130 --> 00:22:30.943
there has never been anything like this.

00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:34.720
For the first time in huge numbers

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:36.810
the ordinary men and women of Beijing,

00:22:36.810 --> 00:22:38.220
the old and the young,

00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:40.040
professors and taxi drivers

00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:42.260
have joined the student protests,

00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:43.990
lending their support
to what has now taken

00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:47.380
all the appearances of a
peaceful popular uprising

00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:50.073
against the oppressiveness
of communist rule.

00:22:51.270 --> 00:22:53.500
As the afternoon wears on here,

00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:55.160
the crowd gets bigger and bigger

00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:58.820
hoping that this protest
will produce results,

00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:01.160
that the government will
respond to the students demand

00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:02.790
for meaningful dialogue

00:23:02.790 --> 00:23:06.570
and begin to implement the
kind of genuine reforms

00:23:06.570 --> 00:23:10.103
as opposed to cosmetic reforms
that the students want.

00:23:12.010 --> 00:23:14.790
- So these protests were going on

00:23:14.790 --> 00:23:17.470
and it soon became clear

00:23:17.470 --> 00:23:20.730
that the regime was
not going tolerate them

00:23:20.730 --> 00:23:24.746
and tanks started appearing
in Tiananmen Square.

00:23:24.746 --> 00:23:27.663
(crowd chattering)

00:23:59.762 --> 00:24:02.429
(crowd yelling)

00:24:38.285 --> 00:24:41.290
So that's not that
different from the video

00:24:41.290 --> 00:24:44.090
we were looking at outside
the White House in Russia

00:24:44.090 --> 00:24:49.090
when Yeltsin climbed the tank,

00:24:49.470 --> 00:24:53.200
and there was the real expectation

00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:54.820
among many of the protesters

00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:59.513
that the Chinese army would
not attack its own citizens.

00:25:00.770 --> 00:25:05.280
And they certainly were appeals
going out to that effect,

00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:07.563
but they turned out that they were wrong.

00:25:09.502 --> 00:25:11.870
(gunshots blazing)

00:25:11.870 --> 00:25:13.040
- The noise of gunfire

00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:16.290
rose from all over the center of Peking.

00:25:16.290 --> 00:25:17.453
It was unremitting.

00:25:21.030 --> 00:25:22.940
On the streets leading
down to the main road

00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:24.610
to Tiananmen Square,

00:25:24.610 --> 00:25:28.350
furious people stared in
disbelief at the glow in the sky,

00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:30.630
listening to the sound of shots.

00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:32.930
Heading down the road
was a hazardous business

00:25:32.930 --> 00:25:34.350
but hundreds of people cheered

00:25:34.350 --> 00:25:37.787
as buses were set alight and
army trucks caught fire too.

00:25:37.787 --> 00:25:39.600
(crowd yelling)

00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:41.230
They yelled and shouted.

00:25:41.230 --> 00:25:44.620
And then as troop lorries were
seen moving down the road,

00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:47.440
there was gunfire from those lorries.

00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:50.357
(gunshots blazing)

00:25:51.270 --> 00:25:54.130
The troops have been
firing indiscriminately,

00:25:54.130 --> 00:25:56.910
but still, there are thousands
of people on the streets

00:25:56.910 --> 00:25:58.920
who will not wield back.

00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:01.380
The bicycle rickshaws
scooped up the injured,

00:26:01.380 --> 00:26:05.010
others were shunted onto
bikes and pedaled to hospital,

00:26:05.010 --> 00:26:08.520
many were carried away by
frantic local residents.

00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:10.350
There was confusion and despair

00:26:10.350 --> 00:26:12.540
among those who could hardly credit

00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:16.030
that their own army was
firing wildly at them.

00:26:16.030 --> 00:26:18.690
Young people was singing the international

00:26:18.690 --> 00:26:21.086
to a background of gunfire.

00:26:21.086 --> 00:26:23.753
(crowd singing)

00:26:25.802 --> 00:26:30.640
After hours of shooting and
facing a line of troops,

00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:32.780
the crowd is still here.

00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:35.147
They're shouting, "Stop the killing

00:26:35.147 --> 00:26:36.697
"and down with the government."

00:26:38.201 --> 00:26:40.830
(gunshots blazing)

00:26:40.830 --> 00:26:42.190
A huge volley of shots

00:26:42.190 --> 00:26:45.650
just as I left the
front lined cause panic.

00:26:45.650 --> 00:26:48.010
The young man in front of me fell dead,

00:26:48.010 --> 00:26:49.740
I fell over him.

00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:52.110
Two others were killed yards away.

00:26:52.110 --> 00:26:55.420
Two more people lay wounded
on the ground near me.

00:26:55.420 --> 00:26:56.400
In the streets,

00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:57.680
many came up to us

00:26:57.680 --> 00:27:00.123
shaking with anger and disbelief and fear.

00:27:00.990 --> 00:27:04.370
Many were terrified, saying
there would be retribution.

00:27:04.370 --> 00:27:06.210
There was not one voice on the streets

00:27:06.210 --> 00:27:09.060
which did not express despair and rage.

00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:10.427
(crowd chattering)

00:27:10.427 --> 00:27:11.410
"Tell the world."

00:27:11.410 --> 00:27:12.860
They said to us.

00:27:12.860 --> 00:27:17.180
- So that was the beginning
of a massive crackdown,

00:27:17.180 --> 00:27:19.070
huge numbers of people.

00:27:19.070 --> 00:27:22.310
We never really got statistics.

00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:25.350
We believe just a number of
people were killed in Tiananmen

00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:29.120
but it was very large numbers
of people were killed.

00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:30.710
Huge numbers of people

00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:35.710
were imprisoned after that
massive political crackdown.

00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:39.140
And in sharp contrast,

00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:41.263
again, this is June of 1989,

00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:47.500
when the the revolution is
all over Eastern Europe,

00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:49.050
the thaw is going on,

00:27:49.050 --> 00:27:51.970
the Soviet Union is not intervening

00:27:51.970 --> 00:27:55.250
in the liberalization
movements in Eastern Europe

00:27:55.250 --> 00:27:59.010
and of course, five months later,

00:27:59.010 --> 00:28:01.810
the wall came down in Germany,

00:28:01.810 --> 00:28:04.360
but China went a very different path.

00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:09.360
That the massive political
repression of this descent

00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:14.400
but it did not stop the economic reforms

00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:16.570
and the economic transformation.

00:28:16.570 --> 00:28:18.143
And as you can see here,

00:28:20.710 --> 00:28:23.640
this is just foreign
direct investment in China,

00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:28.640
it just throughout the 1990s it increases.

00:28:28.690 --> 00:28:33.690
The fact that it's decreasing
as a share of Chinese GDP

00:28:35.770 --> 00:28:39.890
tells you how much the domestic economy

00:28:39.890 --> 00:28:42.263
is developing as well.

00:28:43.402 --> 00:28:46.902
So that even though as in absolute numbers

00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:51.570
foreign direct investment is going up

00:28:51.570 --> 00:28:53.190
by leaps and bounds,

00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:57.470
it's a declining share of
the growing Chinese economy

00:28:57.470 --> 00:28:59.963
which is becoming a powerhouse.

00:29:01.211 --> 00:29:05.190
And here you can seethe
astonishing growth rates

00:29:05.190 --> 00:29:10.190
that have been recorded
in China since since 1989.

00:29:12.790 --> 00:29:14.990
You can see by 1991,

00:29:14.990 --> 00:29:19.730
they were recording already
double digit growth rates

00:29:19.730 --> 00:29:24.730
and they have been the highest
growth rates in the world,

00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:27.433
virtually every year since.

00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:32.520
If you look at manufacturing in China,

00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:35.270
and we'll talk more about manufacturing,

00:29:35.270 --> 00:29:40.270
this is between 2006 and 2016

00:29:40.790 --> 00:29:45.790
as modest increases in the US and Japan,

00:29:46.110 --> 00:29:50.473
just threefold increase
in manufacturing in China,

00:29:52.470 --> 00:29:57.470
just absolutely dramatic
industrial take off.

00:29:57.660 --> 00:30:02.140
Comparable story on a
smaller scale about Vietnam,

00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:06.240
transforms itself from
an extremely poor country

00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:11.240
into a very successful
middle income economy.

00:30:16.669 --> 00:30:19.930
I think it's the fifth
largest economy in East Asia,

00:30:19.930 --> 00:30:24.930
but it is second only to China
in terms of economic growth.

00:30:26.250 --> 00:30:29.540
So these huge success stories,

00:30:29.540 --> 00:30:31.820
and they have been studied to death.

00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:34.860
There have been armies of scholars

00:30:34.860 --> 00:30:38.690
trying to understand the
reasons for this success.

00:30:38.690 --> 00:30:40.470
And in the readings I gave you,

00:30:40.470 --> 00:30:44.270
you get some sense of the
variety of explanations

00:30:44.270 --> 00:30:45.550
that are out there

00:30:45.550 --> 00:30:50.120
that are trying to account
for the dramatic success

00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:52.460
in China and Vietnam.

00:30:52.460 --> 00:30:56.870
And most of these explanations

00:30:56.870 --> 00:31:01.350
suffer from what economists
and political scientists

00:31:01.350 --> 00:31:03.990
refer to as the pathology

00:31:03.990 --> 00:31:07.210
of selecting on the dependent variable.

00:31:07.210 --> 00:31:10.250
That is, everybody focuses
all of their attention

00:31:10.250 --> 00:31:11.540
on China and Vietnam

00:31:11.540 --> 00:31:13.370
in trying to look for characteristics

00:31:13.370 --> 00:31:15.660
that explain the outcome,

00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:16.493
but of course,

00:31:16.493 --> 00:31:18.810
that's not how you do social science,

00:31:18.810 --> 00:31:21.000
we have to think about
the independent variable

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:25.100
because if you select only
on the dependent variable

00:31:25.100 --> 00:31:28.420
namely in this case, economic success,

00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:32.900
you may be missing
what's really causing it

00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:35.890
by not seeing other countries

00:31:35.890 --> 00:31:38.673
that have done the same things
that have not succeeded.

00:31:39.690 --> 00:31:42.900
So, for example,

00:31:42.900 --> 00:31:45.670
Alexander Gerschenkron
was famous for the idea

00:31:45.670 --> 00:31:48.520
that late developers have an advantage,

00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:49.660
they have an advantage

00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:51.850
because they don't have to necessarily

00:31:51.850 --> 00:31:53.740
go through all the stages.

00:31:53.740 --> 00:31:56.880
This is sort of the opposite
of a first mover advantage,

00:31:56.880 --> 00:32:00.450
which we talked about
in tariffs in the EU.

00:32:00.450 --> 00:32:02.590
So the idea is that late developers

00:32:02.590 --> 00:32:04.290
can skip some of the stages.

00:32:04.290 --> 00:32:06.130
You look In Africa,

00:32:06.130 --> 00:32:09.450
you can create a banking
system without banks today

00:32:09.450 --> 00:32:13.240
because people can do banking
on their cell phones, right?

00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:15.950
They don't have to go
through all the stages.

00:32:15.950 --> 00:32:20.950
So these were relatively late developers.

00:32:21.060 --> 00:32:23.570
Well, they were relatively
late developers,

00:32:23.570 --> 00:32:26.590
but they're plenty of
relatively late developers

00:32:26.590 --> 00:32:28.900
that haven't had this kind of success,

00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:33.070
all over Africa, or in
much of Latin America,

00:32:33.070 --> 00:32:34.930
elsewhere in East Asia.

00:32:34.930 --> 00:32:37.840
So the fact of being
a late developer alone

00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:40.763
is obviously not the advantage.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:47.793
They were predominantly
rural at the start.

00:32:50.570 --> 00:32:54.403
So the argument this is
in Moleskine London paper,

00:32:56.150 --> 00:32:58.280
the fact that they didn't have

00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:01.223
inefficient urban economies to dismantle,

00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:06.520
they didn't have a big, inefficient

00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:08.350
economies to dismantle,

00:33:08.350 --> 00:33:10.970
made it easier that as they urbanized,

00:33:10.970 --> 00:33:15.280
they urbanized in
relatively efficient ways.

00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:20.280
Again, there are many
predominantly agrarian countries

00:33:20.357 --> 00:33:25.357
that have not been as successful as them.

00:33:25.410 --> 00:33:28.063
People point to Confucian values.

00:33:29.010 --> 00:33:34.010
Confucianism, above
everything else values order.

00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:37.510
So they say, "Oh, well,
it's Confucian values."

00:33:37.510 --> 00:33:41.060
But of course, there are
countries with Confucian values

00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:44.900
that have not been particularly
successful economically.

00:33:44.900 --> 00:33:47.590
The most obvious and dramatic illustration

00:33:47.590 --> 00:33:49.723
being North Korea.

00:33:51.110 --> 00:33:53.910
Confucian values haven't done anything

00:33:53.910 --> 00:33:56.303
for the North Korean economy.

00:33:57.190 --> 00:34:00.300
Education, both China and Vietnam

00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:02.870
have made huge investments in education.

00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:05.530
They're making bigger
investments for example,

00:34:05.530 --> 00:34:07.713
than we are making in education.

00:34:09.496 --> 00:34:10.930
A K through 12 education

00:34:10.930 --> 00:34:14.560
but also technical
education, science education.

00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:16.520
The few things to say about that

00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:18.660
most of the investments in education

00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:24.450
have come later after
the economic take off,

00:34:24.450 --> 00:34:26.360
but also there're country.

00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:29.953
Russia is an extremely
well educated population,

00:34:32.150 --> 00:34:36.723
Ethiopia has now got
every child in school.

00:34:38.527 --> 00:34:39.840
They're one of the first African countries

00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:43.870
to have such high levels
of K through 12 education

00:34:43.870 --> 00:34:48.650
but they have not been
replicating this success.

00:34:48.650 --> 00:34:51.763
There was a less entrenched
command communist system,

00:34:52.790 --> 00:34:54.690
the Moleskine London piece

00:34:57.912 --> 00:35:00.220
put a lot of credence in this idea

00:35:00.220 --> 00:35:03.320
that the Soviet economy, for example,

00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:06.410
was this massively inefficient,

00:35:06.410 --> 00:35:10.240
but deeply entrenched
communist economic system

00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:13.340
that once they started to dismantle it,

00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:15.820
the whole economy fell apart.

00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:19.170
China and Vietnam

00:35:19.170 --> 00:35:24.170
partly because they were
mainly rural economies

00:35:24.830 --> 00:35:26.870
in the 1970s,

00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:29.473
didn't have these a big entrenched

00:35:29.473 --> 00:35:32.850
communist economic command economies

00:35:32.850 --> 00:35:35.393
that had to be dismantled.

00:35:37.743 --> 00:35:41.330
They involved gradual reform,

00:35:41.330 --> 00:35:42.823
they did not,

00:35:45.220 --> 00:35:49.360
and we'll come back to this in
more detail in a few minutes,

00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:54.360
but they did not simply
replace the communist system

00:35:54.610 --> 00:35:57.180
with the capitalist system.

00:35:57.180 --> 00:35:59.520
In the Soviet Union, there was no choice

00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:02.340
because the communist
system itself just imploded,

00:36:02.340 --> 00:36:03.430
it just collapsed.

00:36:03.430 --> 00:36:06.200
It became completely dysfunctional

00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:09.180
and so they were starting
from ground zero.

00:36:09.180 --> 00:36:11.770
In both China and Vietnam,

00:36:11.770 --> 00:36:15.950
there was a gradual experimental approach,

00:36:15.950 --> 00:36:18.480
as I've already mentioned in China

00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:20.960
in the special economic zones,

00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:24.590
opening their economies to
foreign direct investment

00:36:25.530 --> 00:36:30.530
which enabled the
creation of joint ventures

00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:31.910
with foreign firms

00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:37.760
and allowed the economy to
grow in particular sectors,

00:36:39.820 --> 00:36:44.793
not trying to reinvent
wholesale a new system.

00:36:46.550 --> 00:36:49.250
Experimentalism and decentralization.

00:36:49.250 --> 00:36:51.370
They devolved a lot of power

00:36:51.370 --> 00:36:55.710
to make decisions about
economic performance to regions.

00:36:55.710 --> 00:36:59.980
Provided that they
delivered what was required

00:36:59.980 --> 00:37:01.810
by the central government,

00:37:01.810 --> 00:37:05.940
there was much less
micromanaging from the center

00:37:05.940 --> 00:37:10.900
of how the different
economic enterprises were run

00:37:13.550 --> 00:37:17.490
and how local officials met their goals,

00:37:17.490 --> 00:37:22.490
again, putting less demand
on the central leadership

00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:27.250
to know what to do in every circumstance

00:37:27.250 --> 00:37:30.020
when very often they
didn't know what to do.

00:37:30.020 --> 00:37:34.393
And they knew that they
didn't know what to do.

00:37:37.010 --> 00:37:39.480
Competition within the state sector

00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:42.550
and between the state sector
and the private sector,

00:37:42.550 --> 00:37:46.330
so they created big
state owned enterprises,

00:37:46.330 --> 00:37:48.080
particularly in China,

00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:50.760
but they introduce competition among them

00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:54.510
and they required them to
compete in the private sector

00:37:54.510 --> 00:37:59.510
and they shut down
inefficient state companies.

00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:04.810
It should be said that it's very difficult

00:38:04.810 --> 00:38:09.260
to get a grip on the differences

00:38:09.260 --> 00:38:11.960
between the state sector
and the private sector

00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:14.733
that means very much in China,

00:38:15.710 --> 00:38:20.710
partly because the many of
the private sector companies

00:38:21.950 --> 00:38:24.350
get funding from state banks,

00:38:24.350 --> 00:38:28.520
but also because many
of the top leadership

00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:30.690
of private sector firms

00:38:30.690 --> 00:38:33.060
are members of the Communist Party,

00:38:33.060 --> 00:38:35.720
and have to be members
of the Communist Party.

00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:38.390
And so that raises the question

00:38:38.390 --> 00:38:40.700
while they might be nominally private,

00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:41.810
but what does it mean

00:38:41.810 --> 00:38:46.630
in terms of their influence
ability by the party.

00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:48.050
On the other hand,

00:38:48.050 --> 00:38:51.020
the flip side of that
is that it means that

00:38:51.020 --> 00:38:53.550
the leadership of the Communist Party

00:38:53.550 --> 00:38:56.440
is hearing a lot about the
needs of business all the time,

00:38:56.440 --> 00:38:59.530
because there are many business people,

00:38:59.530 --> 00:39:02.682
business leaders are
in the Communist Party

00:39:02.682 --> 00:39:07.682
and making the case for what they need.

00:39:08.100 --> 00:39:13.080
So the system is relatively competitive

00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:18.080
for a state sector dominated economy.

00:39:19.110 --> 00:39:21.950
Export oriented growth model.

00:39:21.950 --> 00:39:26.950
Again, this is pointed to by many scholars

00:39:28.030 --> 00:39:31.290
that this export basic producing

00:39:32.300 --> 00:39:34.280
for foreign markets,

00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:36.350
manufacturing goods for foreign markets

00:39:36.350 --> 00:39:38.960
has been extremely successful.

00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:40.710
There are many other
countries in the world,

00:39:40.710 --> 00:39:44.210
again, that have produced
for foreign markets

00:39:44.210 --> 00:39:47.123
that have not been as successful.

00:39:49.810 --> 00:39:53.470
Relatively good accountability
and the rule of law.

00:39:53.470 --> 00:39:58.290
So, the system of
accountability it's interesting.

00:39:58.290 --> 00:40:01.080
In China while you can't attack people

00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:02.660
for political reasons,

00:40:02.660 --> 00:40:07.660
you can attack officials for
being inefficient and corrupt.

00:40:08.250 --> 00:40:12.100
And that has usually been the path

00:40:12.100 --> 00:40:17.050
by which people have pushed
for accountability and reform.

00:40:17.050 --> 00:40:21.873
Yuhua Wang in the chapter
I put in with the readings

00:40:24.150 --> 00:40:27.680
from his book, "Tying
the Autocrat's Hands"

00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:29.640
points out that there's been

00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:32.560
a pretty effective increase in the demand

00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:34.190
for the rule of law

00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:37.350
with respect to commercial matters,

00:40:37.350 --> 00:40:40.350
not political matters, commercial matters,

00:40:40.350 --> 00:40:42.080
in the sectors of the economy

00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:45.140
that are dominated by foreign investment.

00:40:45.140 --> 00:40:46.960
And the reason he gives

00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:49.940
and I think it's plausible.

00:40:49.940 --> 00:40:54.690
The reason he gives is that domestic firms

00:40:55.680 --> 00:40:58.610
have access to elites
to solve their problems

00:40:58.610 --> 00:41:00.770
through informal networks,

00:41:00.770 --> 00:41:05.453
the so called guangxi
relationships that they build.

00:41:07.470 --> 00:41:10.030
Distinguishing guangxi from corruption

00:41:10.030 --> 00:41:14.140
is often easier said than done,

00:41:14.140 --> 00:41:15.370
but they have access

00:41:15.370 --> 00:41:18.700
to informal dispute resolution mechanisms,

00:41:18.700 --> 00:41:20.340
whereas the foreign firms do not.

00:41:20.340 --> 00:41:22.860
And so the parts of the economy

00:41:22.860 --> 00:41:24.660
in which the foreign firms are big

00:41:24.660 --> 00:41:26.950
have been where there's
been a lot of demand

00:41:26.950 --> 00:41:30.093
for the creation of courts
to resolve disputes.

00:41:31.890 --> 00:41:36.410
And Wang who's a very impressive

00:41:36.410 --> 00:41:38.660
political scientist at Harvard

00:41:38.660 --> 00:41:41.870
makes the case that it's this
demand for the rule of law

00:41:41.870 --> 00:41:45.470
as a condition for
attracting foreign investment

00:41:45.470 --> 00:41:48.320
that has fed that development.

00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:50.690
Of course, the subtitle of his book

00:41:50.690 --> 00:41:55.550
is Tying the Autocrat's Hands something

00:41:55.550 --> 00:41:58.530
and The Rise of The Rule of Law in China.

00:41:58.530 --> 00:42:00.897
I was recently at a panel
with him where he said,

00:42:00.897 --> 00:42:03.827
"Maybe we should now be talking
about the rise and decline

00:42:03.827 --> 00:42:05.210
"of the rule of law in China."

00:42:05.210 --> 00:42:07.570
Because, as I said earlier,

00:42:07.570 --> 00:42:10.340
slide showed you foreign investment

00:42:10.340 --> 00:42:12.740
is becoming a less important part

00:42:12.740 --> 00:42:14.920
of the Chinese economy

00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:18.780
to the extent that the
demand for the rule of law

00:42:18.780 --> 00:42:22.010
is coming from the
foreign investment sector,

00:42:22.010 --> 00:42:25.170
it might be diminishing.

00:42:25.170 --> 00:42:26.710
Leadership.

00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:30.043
So, leadership.

00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:34.830
Several people have noticed that

00:42:34.830 --> 00:42:37.373
if you look at authoritarian systems,

00:42:38.410 --> 00:42:40.210
that one way to classify them

00:42:40.210 --> 00:42:43.760
is that those that have
managed to renew themselves

00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:46.010
will find mechanisms of renewal

00:42:46.010 --> 00:42:48.010
versus those that have not.

00:42:48.010 --> 00:42:52.000
So, if you think about the Arab monarchies

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:52.950
in the Middle East,

00:42:54.250 --> 00:42:56.690
they stagger on until the king dies.

00:42:56.690 --> 00:42:59.120
Pretty much that's what
happens in monarchies

00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:03.270
or dictatorships in
Africa and Latin America,

00:43:03.270 --> 00:43:06.853
they stagger on until the dictator dies.

00:43:08.210 --> 00:43:10.810
And even in the Middle East,

00:43:10.810 --> 00:43:12.990
Assad is followed by his son,

00:43:12.990 --> 00:43:14.273
you get another Assad.

00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:16.530
And this is true

00:43:16.530 --> 00:43:20.900
in some of the communist
authoritarian systems

00:43:20.900 --> 00:43:23.003
like North Korea,

00:43:24.390 --> 00:43:26.183
Kim Jong-il, Kim Jong-un,

00:43:28.690 --> 00:43:32.817
again, you have you have
aging ossifying leadership's

00:43:33.690 --> 00:43:35.670
that don't manage to renew themselves

00:43:35.670 --> 00:43:38.690
and so kind of drag the
country into the abyss

00:43:39.580 --> 00:43:42.120
as they become geriatric,

00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:45.080
whereas some authoritarian systems

00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:48.853
seem to have come up with
mechanisms to renew themselves.

00:43:51.180 --> 00:43:55.810
If you said to most people,
maybe most people in this room,

00:43:55.810 --> 00:43:58.650
who are the leaders of Vietnam?

00:43:58.650 --> 00:44:00.850
Most people would have
no idea who they are.

00:44:01.961 --> 00:44:02.913
It's a triumvirate,

00:44:03.900 --> 00:44:06.650
they do get replaced over time,

00:44:06.650 --> 00:44:08.990
or you think about Burma.

00:44:08.990 --> 00:44:12.693
Again, there's no cult or personality.

00:44:13.750 --> 00:44:16.650
These are countries in which
they have renewed themselves.

00:44:17.740 --> 00:44:21.380
And in China, after Mao,

00:44:21.380 --> 00:44:24.400
it seemed like they had
really figured out a way

00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:29.400
to avoid the trap of charismatic leaders.

00:44:31.730 --> 00:44:36.730
Indeed, Bo Xilai had been a
member of the Communist Party

00:44:38.070 --> 00:44:39.460
who was quite charismatic

00:44:39.460 --> 00:44:41.356
and some years ago,

00:44:41.356 --> 00:44:44.680
was kicked out and thrown in prison

00:44:44.680 --> 00:44:48.130
and his wife had allegedly
been involved in a murder.

00:44:48.130 --> 00:44:50.900
Many Western scholars interpreted that

00:44:50.900 --> 00:44:52.880
as he was too charismatic

00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:55.020
and the Chinese didn't want,

00:44:55.020 --> 00:44:56.260
they tried charisma,

00:44:56.260 --> 00:44:57.850
they saw where it went with Mao

00:44:57.850 --> 00:45:00.040
and they were into this model

00:45:00.040 --> 00:45:05.040
where people would not
be able to be at the helm

00:45:05.270 --> 00:45:06.820
for more than a decade.

00:45:06.820 --> 00:45:10.210
And so it seemed like
to extent that you need

00:45:10.210 --> 00:45:12.420
young, vigorous leadership,

00:45:12.420 --> 00:45:16.140
countries like China and
Vietnam had solved this problem

00:45:16.140 --> 00:45:20.090
which is hard for
authoritarian systems to do,

00:45:20.090 --> 00:45:24.810
because there's no automatic
mechanism of renewal

00:45:24.810 --> 00:45:27.460
and if a charismatic figure comes along,

00:45:27.460 --> 00:45:30.623
it's very difficult to get them out.

00:45:31.740 --> 00:45:34.560
So that was another
reason people pointed to.

00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:35.510
So this is, I think,

00:45:35.510 --> 00:45:39.490
11 reasons you could pull
out of those review essays

00:45:39.490 --> 00:45:42.823
and no doubt people
could come up with more.

00:45:44.470 --> 00:45:46.940
And the truth is, nobody knows,

00:45:46.940 --> 00:45:48.473
there's no silver bullet here.

00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:52.470
There is some combinations
of these things,

00:45:52.470 --> 00:45:53.830
there things like luck

00:45:54.750 --> 00:45:59.160
but these are out there
as the main explanations

00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:04.160
for why these countries have
been so successful, right?

00:46:04.620 --> 00:46:07.640
It then puts on the table the question,

00:46:07.640 --> 00:46:10.763
well, how sustainable is this success?

00:46:11.710 --> 00:46:15.810
Should we be expecting it
to continue going forward?

00:46:15.810 --> 00:46:18.990
And can we have long-term

00:46:18.990 --> 00:46:22.130
successful capitalist authoritarianism?

00:46:22.130 --> 00:46:23.090
This, if you like,

00:46:23.090 --> 00:46:25.540
is the question put on the table

00:46:26.430 --> 00:46:29.770
by the success of these countries

00:46:29.770 --> 00:46:33.210
now over a period of two decades

00:46:33.210 --> 00:46:38.210
beyond the wildest dreams
economically of any observer,

00:46:39.100 --> 00:46:41.750
and maybe anybody even in those countries

00:46:41.750 --> 00:46:46.320
along with very repressive
political regimes.

00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:50.420
And, so how do think about that.

00:46:50.420 --> 00:46:53.330
Well, there's some
questions to wonder about

00:46:53.330 --> 00:46:57.280
with respect just to the economies.

00:46:57.280 --> 00:47:00.860
One is that since 2008,

00:47:00.860 --> 00:47:05.080
we have seen a resurgence in
the growth of the state sectors

00:47:05.080 --> 00:47:06.980
of these economies.

00:47:06.980 --> 00:47:09.360
This is partly, as I intimated,

00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:11.600
at right at the beginning
of today's lecture,

00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:15.560
that now that the Washington
Consensus is in bad odor,

00:47:15.560 --> 00:47:18.490
people are now talking
about the Beijing Consensus.

00:47:18.490 --> 00:47:22.800
Until 2008, China made
no attempt to export

00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:25.180
its development model elsewhere,

00:47:25.180 --> 00:47:27.540
they would kind of back on their heels

00:47:27.540 --> 00:47:32.000
about the Washington Consensus.

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:34.440
That is no longer true.

00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:36.560
Not only is the state sector

00:47:36.560 --> 00:47:39.230
in the Chinese economy expanded,

00:47:39.230 --> 00:47:43.350
they are now training people
from many developing countries

00:47:43.350 --> 00:47:45.520
in economic management

00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:50.170
pushing a very different
model of state-led growth

00:47:51.300 --> 00:47:56.300
from the model that was being purveyed

00:47:56.810 --> 00:47:59.020
in the Washington Consensus.

00:47:59.020 --> 00:48:03.040
And to the extent that the state sector

00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:05.180
is gonna be less efficient,

00:48:05.180 --> 00:48:08.270
that raises questions
about how sustainable

00:48:08.270 --> 00:48:10.420
these growth rates are.

00:48:10.420 --> 00:48:14.240
Because even though relatively efficient,

00:48:14.240 --> 00:48:16.963
compared to other command economies,

00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:20.610
they're less efficient
than the private sector

00:48:22.860 --> 00:48:25.290
in those countries and elsewhere.

00:48:25.290 --> 00:48:30.290
Then there's what Steinfeld in
that "Playing Our Game" book

00:48:31.540 --> 00:48:33.150
that I put on there calls,

00:48:33.150 --> 00:48:35.570
the smile curve of profitability,

00:48:35.570 --> 00:48:40.390
and so, this is the idea
which he actually takes from

00:48:40.390 --> 00:48:42.533
somebody calls Stan Shi.

00:48:44.390 --> 00:48:46.040
This is the idea that

00:48:47.467 --> 00:48:52.010
if you look at where the
biggest profitability

00:48:52.010 --> 00:48:54.110
in manufacturing comes from,

00:48:54.110 --> 00:48:57.630
most of it is either at the R&amp;D phase,

00:48:57.630 --> 00:49:01.230
research and development upstream,

00:49:01.230 --> 00:49:04.630
or it's in the manufacturing
and marketing downstream.

00:49:04.630 --> 00:49:09.430
If you think about where's the
money made out of an iPhone?

00:49:09.430 --> 00:49:12.460
It's people who come up
with the basic technologies,

00:49:12.460 --> 00:49:13.720
make a lot of money,

00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:16.500
and then the people who put
it together, do the marketing,

00:49:16.500 --> 00:49:17.760
make a lot of money.

00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:19.840
So the solid curve here,

00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:21.978
what it's telling you is that

00:49:21.978 --> 00:49:25.490
there's not that much money to
be made in the manufacturing,

00:49:25.490 --> 00:49:27.700
this is just low wage labor

00:49:27.700 --> 00:49:30.770
and these are these people
working on assembly lines.

00:49:30.770 --> 00:49:33.470
That's not the source
of great profitability

00:49:33.470 --> 00:49:37.680
but that has been where
most of the economic action

00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:40.440
has been in these economies.

00:49:40.440 --> 00:49:45.440
The dotted line is that
realizing that the Chinese

00:49:47.510 --> 00:49:52.510
have started to try and move
further up the smiley curve

00:49:53.190 --> 00:49:54.280
in both directions,

00:49:54.280 --> 00:49:56.260
so they tried to get more involved

00:49:56.260 --> 00:49:57.610
in research and development

00:49:57.610 --> 00:50:02.007
and more involved in marketing and sales.

00:50:03.700 --> 00:50:04.810
But of course,

00:50:04.810 --> 00:50:07.440
they do that largely by imitating,

00:50:07.440 --> 00:50:09.030
sort of creating if you like,

00:50:09.030 --> 00:50:12.130
generic versions that
are copying technologies

00:50:12.130 --> 00:50:14.870
and then copying marketing methods.

00:50:14.870 --> 00:50:15.820
And if you do that,

00:50:15.820 --> 00:50:17.460
that tends to move,

00:50:17.460 --> 00:50:20.150
it means everybody else can do it too.

00:50:20.150 --> 00:50:22.220
And so if you like

00:50:22.220 --> 00:50:24.960
are sawing off the
branch you're sitting on,

00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:27.980
and so it's not clear
that they're gonna be able

00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:31.653
to continue to be profitable.

00:50:34.420 --> 00:50:35.653
Picking winners.

00:50:37.340 --> 00:50:40.570
Economists always
criticize central planning

00:50:40.570 --> 00:50:42.610
because governments pick winners

00:50:42.610 --> 00:50:44.630
and governments don't
know how to pick winners.

00:50:44.630 --> 00:50:46.440
They don't know where are gonna be

00:50:47.300 --> 00:50:51.220
the successful parts of the economy.

00:50:51.220 --> 00:50:53.120
That is less of a problem

00:50:53.120 --> 00:50:55.230
in the early stages of industrialization.

00:50:55.230 --> 00:50:56.290
You know what you have to do,

00:50:56.290 --> 00:50:57.500
you have to build cities,

00:50:57.500 --> 00:50:58.530
you have to build roads,

00:50:58.530 --> 00:50:59.640
you have to build housing,

00:50:59.640 --> 00:51:00.930
you have to put in electricity,

00:51:00.930 --> 00:51:02.510
you have to put in water.

00:51:02.510 --> 00:51:05.250
Once you get into complex economies,

00:51:05.250 --> 00:51:07.390
it's very much more difficult

00:51:07.390 --> 00:51:11.320
to know where the successful
innovations are gonna be

00:51:11.320 --> 00:51:12.680
and where they're not gonna be.

00:51:12.680 --> 00:51:15.010
And so the government's might start

00:51:15.010 --> 00:51:20.010
to make a lot of bets
as governments often do

00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:22.370
when they start to pick winners.

00:51:22.370 --> 00:51:26.300
So as growth becomes more complex,

00:51:26.300 --> 00:51:29.150
it becomes less likely

00:51:29.150 --> 00:51:32.940
that you're gonna have
even relatively efficient

00:51:32.940 --> 00:51:35.250
political leadership's

00:51:35.250 --> 00:51:39.773
successfully keep picking
winners in the economy.

00:51:42.350 --> 00:51:44.360
Changing leadership and corruption.

00:51:44.360 --> 00:51:48.440
The story I told about China's leadership

00:51:48.440 --> 00:51:52.060
in the last five years seems
to have gone out the window.

00:51:52.060 --> 00:51:56.010
So now as Donald Trump complains,

00:51:58.040 --> 00:52:00.370
Xi Jinping might be there for life

00:52:01.650 --> 00:52:05.252
and Trump is clearly somewhat
envious about that idea.

00:52:05.252 --> 00:52:06.085
(students laughing)

00:52:06.085 --> 00:52:11.085
But the 10 year term limit

00:52:11.210 --> 00:52:14.920
has now been abandoned at his request

00:52:14.920 --> 00:52:18.110
and he is a very charismatic figure,

00:52:18.110 --> 00:52:23.110
certainly the most powerful
Chinese leader since Mao.

00:52:23.230 --> 00:52:27.220
And so it may well be that the mechanism

00:52:27.220 --> 00:52:32.220
for ensuring leadership
renewal is breaking down,

00:52:32.460 --> 00:52:35.440
or has perhaps even broken down.

00:52:35.440 --> 00:52:39.670
In Vietnam, they had almost
a separation of powers system

00:52:39.670 --> 00:52:41.330
with different leaders,

00:52:41.330 --> 00:52:43.660
responsible for different parts

00:52:43.660 --> 00:52:46.540
of the political and legal system

00:52:46.540 --> 00:52:49.650
and that also seems to be breaking down

00:52:49.650 --> 00:52:51.360
or at least under strain

00:52:51.360 --> 00:52:55.260
from reports that it's possible to get.

00:52:55.260 --> 00:52:57.580
I already mentioned Yuhua Wang's point

00:52:57.580 --> 00:52:59.237
that to the extent that

00:52:59.237 --> 00:53:01.750
the rule of law in the economy

00:53:02.590 --> 00:53:06.320
was dependent on demand
from the foreign sector,

00:53:06.320 --> 00:53:07.790
that might be going away

00:53:07.790 --> 00:53:11.950
as foreign investment as a
proportion of the Chinese economy

00:53:11.950 --> 00:53:13.950
is actually shrinking.

00:53:13.950 --> 00:53:17.090
And given the trade
wars that we are now in,

00:53:17.090 --> 00:53:19.440
they might be shrinking a lot further

00:53:19.440 --> 00:53:21.390
than we talked about before.

00:53:21.390 --> 00:53:25.400
And so that plus the leadership
changes might mean that

00:53:25.400 --> 00:53:28.420
we're gonna see increases
in corruption again,

00:53:28.420 --> 00:53:30.830
inefficient management,

00:53:30.830 --> 00:53:33.123
different forms of corruption.

00:53:35.720 --> 00:53:37.280
Then the next thing

00:53:37.280 --> 00:53:39.630
and this is gonna now we're
gonna start transitioning

00:53:39.630 --> 00:53:42.070
to talking about politics

00:53:42.070 --> 00:53:46.690
is that when you create
big industrial workforces

00:53:46.690 --> 00:53:48.550
working on assembly lines,

00:53:48.550 --> 00:53:51.290
eventually they start to make demands,

00:53:51.290 --> 00:53:54.210
they start to want higher wages.

00:53:54.210 --> 00:53:58.600
And this is so called flying geese theory

00:53:58.600 --> 00:53:59.950
of economic development.

00:53:59.950 --> 00:54:03.110
This is the idea that capital is gonna go

00:54:03.110 --> 00:54:05.283
to wherever labor is cheapest.

00:54:06.410 --> 00:54:10.003
And so, if you look here,

00:54:11.520 --> 00:54:16.520
these are wages in China,
Mexico and Vietnam,

00:54:17.350 --> 00:54:19.080
what you can see is that

00:54:20.300 --> 00:54:22.630
since the beginning of this century,

00:54:22.630 --> 00:54:27.630
wages in China have gone
up quite dramatically

00:54:27.860 --> 00:54:32.030
and they're now substantially
above wages in Mexico

00:54:32.030 --> 00:54:33.930
and wages in Vietnam,

00:54:33.930 --> 00:54:35.730
which while they've gone up,

00:54:35.730 --> 00:54:38.780
have gone up nowhere near as much.

00:54:38.780 --> 00:54:43.780
And so, if you look at this is
called the labor cost index,

00:54:44.340 --> 00:54:46.740
which basically measures the cost

00:54:46.740 --> 00:54:49.303
of producing one unit of output.

00:54:50.150 --> 00:54:52.593
You can see that they are two.

00:54:54.350 --> 00:54:57.430
The cost of labor has gone up in China

00:54:57.430 --> 00:55:00.870
quite dramatically during this century

00:55:02.900 --> 00:55:06.540
and that has meant that the
geese are flying out of China,

00:55:06.540 --> 00:55:09.413
they're flying to places
where labor is cheaper.

00:55:10.780 --> 00:55:14.980
This is the Nike plant
in Ho Chi Minh City,

00:55:14.980 --> 00:55:18.213
which I visited in March of 2001.

00:55:19.780 --> 00:55:24.780
It was run by a Vietnamese
management company,

00:55:25.680 --> 00:55:30.680
with about 20,000 Vietnamese
women working in it there.

00:55:30.950 --> 00:55:34.220
The whole thing consisted of,

00:55:34.220 --> 00:55:38.060
it looked like four
giant football stadiums.

00:55:38.060 --> 00:55:41.110
This is about an hour's drive
outside of Ho Chi Minh City,

00:55:41.110 --> 00:55:44.470
which used to be Saigon.

00:55:44.470 --> 00:55:48.920
It looks like four giant football fields

00:55:48.920 --> 00:55:51.060
but all of them built out of aluminum.

00:55:51.060 --> 00:55:52.720
You can see they could be packed up

00:55:52.720 --> 00:55:57.640
and put into a bunch of planes

00:55:57.640 --> 00:56:02.420
and flown off to somewhere
else at relatively low cost.

00:56:02.420 --> 00:56:05.910
And here are some of the people working,

00:56:05.910 --> 00:56:10.153
what strikes you about these pictures?

00:56:17.080 --> 00:56:19.223
What's notable about these pictures?

00:56:25.900 --> 00:56:26.955
Yeah.

00:56:26.955 --> 00:56:28.241
- [Student] They're all women.

00:56:28.241 --> 00:56:33.080
- They're all women and
they are all Vietnamese,

00:56:33.080 --> 00:56:34.590
the management of old Taiwanese

00:56:34.590 --> 00:56:36.100
and all the men, by the way,

00:56:36.100 --> 00:56:37.800
almost all men.

00:56:37.800 --> 00:56:39.573
Yeah, what else is striking?

00:56:42.720 --> 00:56:44.740
I don't know if the
picture is quite captured.

00:56:44.740 --> 00:56:47.773
It's incredibly labor-intensive.

00:56:49.072 --> 00:56:52.693
These machines looked like
they're 20 or 30 years old.

00:56:54.350 --> 00:56:56.480
Making a Nike running shoe

00:56:56.480 --> 00:57:00.280
is split into about 35 different tasks,

00:57:00.280 --> 00:57:02.470
one person is cutting the little pieces

00:57:03.640 --> 00:57:04.830
with a cutting machine,

00:57:04.830 --> 00:57:06.223
one person is putting glue,

00:57:07.480 --> 00:57:09.770
it's an unbelievably labor-intensive

00:57:09.770 --> 00:57:12.870
because labor is so cheap.

00:57:12.870 --> 00:57:15.230
That after all is why they went there

00:57:15.230 --> 00:57:19.360
and indeed, I spent the day there

00:57:19.360 --> 00:57:22.770
and walking around with
the mid-level manager,

00:57:22.770 --> 00:57:26.500
and I asked him his personal history

00:57:26.500 --> 00:57:28.047
and he said,

00:57:28.047 --> 00:57:31.270
"Well, I used to manage a
plant like this in China."

00:57:31.270 --> 00:57:33.810
So I said, well, what's
the biggest difference

00:57:33.810 --> 00:57:36.520
between managing a plan like this in China

00:57:36.520 --> 00:57:39.320
and manage a plan like this in Vietnam?

00:57:39.320 --> 00:57:40.857
And the answer was,

00:57:40.857 --> 00:57:44.295
"The Vietnamese argue
less at work harder."

00:57:44.295 --> 00:57:45.220
(students laughing)

00:57:45.220 --> 00:57:47.370
And I'm sure that was exactly true

00:57:47.370 --> 00:57:49.340
because the Chinese workers

00:57:49.340 --> 00:57:52.080
had been doing this
kind of work for longer

00:57:53.050 --> 00:57:57.480
and they had started
developing aspirations

00:57:57.480 --> 00:58:02.170
and so Nike had moved
the plant to Vietnam.

00:58:02.170 --> 00:58:07.170
And so the idea would be that
of the flying geese theory,

00:58:08.520 --> 00:58:13.520
that eventually demands for higher wages

00:58:13.960 --> 00:58:17.350
would cause the geese to fly.

00:58:17.350 --> 00:58:21.310
And, Vietnam will get
this benefit for a while,

00:58:21.310 --> 00:58:26.160
but then the geese will fly to Cambodia,

00:58:26.160 --> 00:58:27.780
or wherever the next place is

00:58:27.780 --> 00:58:30.580
or maybe Zimbabwe.

00:58:30.580 --> 00:58:35.484
Now, this is also exacerbated
the coming economy

00:58:35.484 --> 00:58:39.530
by the probability that
a lot of these jobs

00:58:39.530 --> 00:58:41.700
are gonna eventually
be going to technology

00:58:41.700 --> 00:58:45.920
that is, the technology
is gonna become so cheap,

00:58:45.920 --> 00:58:47.560
that it will no longer be worth it

00:58:47.560 --> 00:58:51.120
to pay even starvation wages

00:58:51.120 --> 00:58:55.220
and so the geese might
stop flying all together.

00:58:55.220 --> 00:58:57.830
But it's again gonna put stress

00:58:57.830 --> 00:59:02.470
on economies that are dependent
a lot on manufacturing

00:59:02.470 --> 00:59:05.503
for feeding their populations.

00:59:07.020 --> 00:59:09.880
Slowing growth and regime legitimacy.

00:59:09.880 --> 00:59:12.540
A lot of people have argued

00:59:12.540 --> 00:59:15.540
that the legitimacy of these regimes

00:59:15.540 --> 00:59:19.280
depends upon their delivery growth,

00:59:19.280 --> 00:59:20.700
yes, they don't have elections,

00:59:20.700 --> 00:59:22.930
so they don't have
political accountability

00:59:22.930 --> 00:59:25.150
but people have been satisfied

00:59:25.150 --> 00:59:27.870
because the standard of
living has been going up,

00:59:27.870 --> 00:59:30.203
they've been doing a
lot better economically,

00:59:32.870 --> 00:59:34.040
they're employed,

00:59:34.040 --> 00:59:39.040
and they have had prospects
for upward mobility.

00:59:39.050 --> 00:59:42.090
As as growth slows in these economies,

00:59:42.090 --> 00:59:45.410
which almost every economic projection

00:59:45.410 --> 00:59:47.160
predicts that it will,

00:59:47.160 --> 00:59:50.069
that's gonna become harder
and harder to sustain

00:59:50.069 --> 00:59:52.373
and so you're gonna get pressure,

00:59:53.520 --> 00:59:57.270
and maybe resurgence of political dissent

00:59:57.270 --> 01:00:00.150
and they're gonna be
strains on those economies.

01:00:00.150 --> 01:00:03.540
So despite the many reasons

01:00:03.540 --> 01:00:05.670
that people cite for the success,

01:00:05.670 --> 01:00:07.560
there are reasons also to wonder

01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:11.580
how sustainable these models might be.

01:00:11.580 --> 01:00:14.800
And this leads us to thinking about

01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:18.973
the relationships between
political and economic reform.

01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:24.903
During the transition in
Eastern Europe in 1989,

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.470
people started worrying a lot about this

01:00:28.470 --> 01:00:33.470
and these were the debates
about shock therapy,

01:00:34.750 --> 01:00:37.140
should we have a dramatic
reform right away,

01:00:37.140 --> 01:00:38.710
get the paint over with

01:00:38.710 --> 01:00:41.090
and then do political reform?

01:00:41.090 --> 01:00:43.930
Or should we do political reform first,

01:00:43.930 --> 01:00:45.940
or do them in tandem.

01:00:45.940 --> 01:00:47.630
And I've put three people up here

01:00:47.630 --> 01:00:51.020
because they ideologically
from very different places.

01:00:51.020 --> 01:00:54.770
Adam Przeworski is a former Marxist,

01:00:54.770 --> 01:00:58.590
he wrote a book called "Democracy
and the Market" in 1991.

01:00:58.590 --> 01:01:01.450
Janos Kornai "The Road to a Free Economy"

01:01:01.450 --> 01:01:05.280
is a riff off Hayex road to Saf deb

01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:07.430
So he was a kind of libertarian,

01:01:07.430 --> 01:01:09.840
and Jeff Sachs was a kind
of middle of the road

01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:12.080
policy wonkish economy

01:01:13.020 --> 01:01:14.780
but they all made the same argument,

01:01:14.780 --> 01:01:16.533
which was essentially this,

01:01:19.410 --> 01:01:22.753
If you think about a
collapsing communist economy,

01:01:24.790 --> 01:01:28.050
as the old system is dismantled,

01:01:28.050 --> 01:01:31.190
eventually people are gonna
be thrown into distress

01:01:31.190 --> 01:01:32.650
and it's gonna get so bad

01:01:34.353 --> 01:01:37.560
per capita income is gonna
fall below the poverty line.

01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:40.240
Eventually, things will get better, yeah.

01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:44.250
But what if you democratize here,

01:01:44.250 --> 01:01:47.680
then all of these people
are gonna be angry

01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:49.700
and they're gonna use
their democratic rights

01:01:49.700 --> 01:01:51.130
to stop the reforms

01:01:51.130 --> 01:01:53.663
and so instead of turning the corner,

01:01:54.740 --> 01:01:57.330
you're gonna just keep crashing down.

01:01:57.330 --> 01:01:59.660
And so the shock therapy people said,

01:01:59.660 --> 01:02:04.660
No, let's not democratize
until this point,

01:02:05.410 --> 01:02:09.573
once the worst economic
pain has been experienced.

01:02:11.510 --> 01:02:15.070
So these technocrats had
the same kind of hubris

01:02:15.070 --> 01:02:17.490
as we were talking about last time,

01:02:17.490 --> 01:02:21.240
they really thought that they understood

01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:23.810
everything about market economies

01:02:23.810 --> 01:02:26.620
but they got a lot of things wrong.

01:02:26.620 --> 01:02:30.540
For example, both paths have
turned out to be successful.

01:02:30.540 --> 01:02:33.350
If you compare Poland
that had shock therapy

01:02:33.350 --> 01:02:36.550
with the Czech Republic
that went with gradualism,

01:02:36.550 --> 01:02:40.210
they both been among
the two most successful

01:02:40.210 --> 01:02:43.823
former communist economies
in Eastern Europe.

01:02:47.547 --> 01:02:49.660
Of course, Poland's four times the size

01:02:49.660 --> 01:02:50.493
and so on,

01:02:50.493 --> 01:02:54.653
but they both have had very
successful development pads.

01:02:55.816 --> 01:02:58.350
So it's not clear what
made that much difference.

01:02:58.350 --> 01:02:59.900
The other thing that it ignores

01:02:59.900 --> 01:03:02.010
and this is really important,

01:03:02.010 --> 01:03:04.900
it's not only the losers
from reform who mobilized,

01:03:04.900 --> 01:03:07.290
it's the winners who mobilized as well.

01:03:07.290 --> 01:03:09.740
The people who get
things out of the reforms

01:03:09.740 --> 01:03:13.120
don't want things to go away.

01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:15.490
And so it's far from obvious

01:03:15.490 --> 01:03:19.500
that democratizing while you're
doing economic development

01:03:19.500 --> 01:03:22.480
is only gonna empower the
people who wanna stop it

01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:23.870
but on the contrary,

01:03:23.870 --> 01:03:28.423
it might actually help
economic reform go along.

01:03:30.150 --> 01:03:35.003
The economic advantages
of gradualism get lost.

01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:41.560
So one of the big secrets of
success in China and Vietnam

01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:44.180
was this to track pricing system

01:03:44.180 --> 01:03:47.180
where they created a second economy

01:03:47.180 --> 01:03:48.890
next to the state sector,

01:03:48.890 --> 01:03:50.720
not instead of the state sector.

01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:53.400
So basically people were told,

01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:57.610
if you can produce at
the government set price,

01:03:57.610 --> 01:04:00.160
what's your quotas required,

01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:02.710
on top of that you can
produce as much as you want

01:04:02.710 --> 01:04:04.560
and sell it at market prices.

01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:08.020
And so that was one of the ways in which

01:04:08.020 --> 01:04:11.000
a market economy was created alongside

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:12.810
the socialist sector

01:04:12.810 --> 01:04:16.510
and didn't depend upon its destruction.

01:04:16.510 --> 01:04:19.370
Those are the kind of advantages you forgo

01:04:19.370 --> 01:04:21.840
when you go for shock therapy.

01:04:27.860 --> 01:04:30.720
And this leads to a
broader set of questions

01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:33.810
about modernization that I
just want us to end with,

01:04:33.810 --> 01:04:37.640
which is that the old
modernization theories

01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:40.270
said that economic development

01:04:40.270 --> 01:04:44.770
would inevitably produce
demands for democracy.

01:04:44.770 --> 01:04:46.810
And I'm giving here one,

01:04:46.810 --> 01:04:49.290
you can find a million
statements like this

01:04:49.290 --> 01:04:51.037
but here the person is saying,

01:04:51.037 --> 01:04:53.367
"The effects of socio and economic change,

01:04:53.367 --> 01:04:56.477
"rising literacy and
common urbanization rights,

01:04:56.477 --> 01:04:57.847
"along with the improvements

01:04:57.847 --> 01:05:00.897
"of communications technologies

01:05:00.897 --> 01:05:03.207
"reduce the cost of collective action,

01:05:03.207 --> 01:05:05.277
"delegitimize autocratic rule,

01:05:05.277 --> 01:05:08.367
"and foster demands for greater democracy.

01:05:08.367 --> 01:05:10.497
"As a result, authoritarian regimes

01:05:10.497 --> 01:05:12.737
"which have a relatively easy time

01:05:12.737 --> 01:05:15.837
"ruling poor and agrarian societies

01:05:15.837 --> 01:05:18.927
"find it increasingly difficult
and ultimately impossible

01:05:18.927 --> 01:05:22.887
"to maintain their rule once
socioeconomic development

01:05:22.887 --> 01:05:25.210
"reaches a certain level."

01:05:25.210 --> 01:05:29.023
That was a scholar talking
about China five years ago.

01:05:29.970 --> 01:05:32.000
The trouble with modernization theory

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.670
is that that logic is very unclear.

01:05:34.670 --> 01:05:37.980
Why exactly is modernization

01:05:37.980 --> 01:05:41.340
gonna produce a demand for democracy?

01:05:41.340 --> 01:05:44.280
And if you sort of trawl through it,

01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:47.000
you find at least three arguments there.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.790
So the most famous one,

01:05:49.790 --> 01:05:51.960
first made famous by Barrington Moore

01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:54.200
was that it's all about the bourgeoisie.

01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:56.890
No bourgeoisie, no democracy.

01:05:56.890 --> 01:05:58.550
And I've mentioned some other

01:05:58.550 --> 01:05:59.917
modernizations theories there.

01:05:59.917 --> 01:06:02.570
And so there the thinking seemed to be

01:06:03.570 --> 01:06:06.120
that as you got a middle class,

01:06:06.120 --> 01:06:08.930
a middle class is gonna
want bourgeois freedoms,

01:06:08.930 --> 01:06:11.480
they're gonna want to be able to travel,

01:06:11.480 --> 01:06:15.040
they're gonna want their
kids to have opportunities

01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:16.840
and so they're gonna put pressure

01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:19.313
on the regime to change.

01:06:20.390 --> 01:06:22.350
Nonetheless, if the bourgeoisie

01:06:22.350 --> 01:06:23.990
are getting everything they want,

01:06:23.990 --> 01:06:27.000
it's not obvious that they
really gonna demand changes,

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:30.800
particularly if their
lifestyles are improving.

01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:34.283
Certainly no inexorable
logic why that might happen.

01:06:36.500 --> 01:06:38.330
So then a second variant,

01:06:38.330 --> 01:06:40.620
this really goes back to Marx and Engels,

01:06:40.620 --> 01:06:43.670
but I put up some more
recent scholars of it.

01:06:43.670 --> 01:06:45.110
It's not about the bourgeoisie,

01:06:45.110 --> 01:06:46.830
it's about the working class.

01:06:46.830 --> 01:06:48.250
It's the working class,

01:06:48.250 --> 01:06:50.540
no working class, no democracy.

01:06:50.540 --> 01:06:53.730
And you've gotta have an
industrial working class

01:06:53.730 --> 01:06:55.240
that is gonna get angry

01:06:55.240 --> 01:06:58.600
as its relative and
perhaps absolute position

01:06:58.600 --> 01:07:02.030
eventually deteriorate
and they're gonna demand.

01:07:02.030 --> 01:07:05.393
So it's gonna be pressure from below.

01:07:06.270 --> 01:07:11.270
And so this is what these
scholars argue in different ways.

01:07:11.860 --> 01:07:13.770
Then a third group of scholars say

01:07:13.770 --> 01:07:15.850
actually it's all about war,

01:07:15.850 --> 01:07:18.300
that when governments fight wars,

01:07:18.300 --> 01:07:20.770
what they need is people
to pay for the wars

01:07:20.770 --> 01:07:22.580
and people that fight the wars.

01:07:22.580 --> 01:07:24.790
And so they're gonna
have to make concessions

01:07:24.790 --> 01:07:27.410
when they tax people with income

01:07:27.410 --> 01:07:29.691
and they're gonna have to make concessions

01:07:29.691 --> 01:07:32.070
when they ask people to go and fight.

01:07:32.070 --> 01:07:35.307
I should have put Michael
Klarman's book up here,

01:07:35.307 --> 01:07:36.490
"Unfinished Business"

01:07:36.490 --> 01:07:40.370
he points out that every single increase

01:07:40.370 --> 01:07:45.370
in political conditions
for African Americans

01:07:46.450 --> 01:07:48.883
in the US has been associated with a war.

01:07:49.760 --> 01:07:52.010
That getting them to fight

01:07:52.010 --> 01:07:55.563
has involved making political concessions.

01:07:56.480 --> 01:07:59.580
There again you have to wonder,

01:07:59.580 --> 01:08:03.150
Well, now when you no
longer need large armies

01:08:03.150 --> 01:08:04.463
to fight wars,

01:08:05.410 --> 01:08:07.810
you can be doing it with
drones and so forth,

01:08:07.810 --> 01:08:10.030
maybe that pressure won't be there.

01:08:10.030 --> 01:08:11.450
And we've been fighting wars

01:08:11.450 --> 01:08:13.630
for the last two decades on debt.

01:08:13.630 --> 01:08:16.880
So we don't have to make
concessions to the unborn

01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:19.020
who are gonna be paying these debts.

01:08:19.020 --> 01:08:22.500
So there are these different logics

01:08:22.500 --> 01:08:24.560
but the upshot for the future

01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:28.080
in thinking about the future is that

01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:30.410
democracy is not inevitable;

01:08:30.410 --> 01:08:34.140
it depends upon contingent
historical struggles.

01:08:34.140 --> 01:08:36.940
There's no reason to think it will spring

01:08:36.940 --> 01:08:40.880
from processes of economic
development and modernization.

01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:42.780
They're conditions unto which it will,

01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:47.210
becomes more likely and
we'll talk about them later

01:08:47.210 --> 01:08:48.663
but it's not obvious.

01:08:50.130 --> 01:08:52.460
Even if these economies do falter

01:08:52.460 --> 01:08:56.210
and wages stagnate and they
start to lose legitimacy,

01:08:56.210 --> 01:08:58.460
they might just become more repressive.

01:08:58.460 --> 01:09:00.850
There's no obvious reason to think

01:09:00.850 --> 01:09:02.540
that they will democratize,

01:09:02.540 --> 01:09:03.630
perhaps they will,

01:09:03.630 --> 01:09:06.240
but perhaps they will double down.

01:09:06.240 --> 01:09:09.480
And in a post-Foucauldian world,

01:09:09.480 --> 01:09:12.280
this may take the form
of what he referred to as

01:09:12.280 --> 01:09:14.030
the gentle way in punishment

01:09:14.030 --> 01:09:19.030
rather than throwing large
numbers of people into prison.

01:09:20.778 --> 01:09:23.361
(upbeat music)

01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:26.360
- [Narrator] So picture your life

01:09:26.360 --> 01:09:28.740
in a place where everything you do,

01:09:28.740 --> 01:09:31.180
what you buy, how you behave,

01:09:31.180 --> 01:09:32.440
is tracked.

01:09:32.440 --> 01:09:34.210
The government gives you a score.

01:09:34.210 --> 01:09:36.140
And the score is a measure

01:09:36.140 --> 01:09:38.720
of how trustworthy you are as a citizen,

01:09:38.720 --> 01:09:42.860
and determines what you're
allowed to do, like ever.

01:09:42.860 --> 01:09:45.170
boarding a train, getting a mortgage,

01:09:45.170 --> 01:09:47.900
all goes back to this score.

01:09:47.900 --> 01:09:50.043
It's called social credit.

01:09:50.043 --> 01:09:52.793
(ungainly music)

01:09:53.990 --> 01:09:56.160
The system's eyes are in big data,

01:09:56.160 --> 01:09:57.880
artificial intelligence,

01:09:57.880 --> 01:10:02.200
and roughly 200 million
surveillance cameras.

01:10:02.200 --> 01:10:04.860
The scores go from 350 to 950

01:10:04.860 --> 01:10:07.283
and are based on habits and behavior.

01:10:08.580 --> 01:10:11.090
Buy clothes or diapers, it's good.

01:10:11.090 --> 01:10:14.140
A lot of alcohol, too many video games.

01:10:14.140 --> 01:10:15.340
Not so good.

01:10:15.340 --> 01:10:17.040
And it's mandatory.

01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:18.210
When it goes national,

01:10:18.210 --> 01:10:20.290
social credit scores will be assigned

01:10:20.290 --> 01:10:24.200
to every one of China's citizens for life.

01:10:24.200 --> 01:10:28.140
In 2014, the Communist
Party called for a system

01:10:28.140 --> 01:10:31.790
to allow the trustworthy to
probe everywhere under heaven,

01:10:31.790 --> 01:10:34.100
while making it hard for the discredited

01:10:34.100 --> 01:10:35.693
to take a single step.

01:10:36.610 --> 01:10:39.090
The model is a place called Rong Chang

01:10:39.090 --> 01:10:40.880
it's in Chandon province.

01:10:40.880 --> 01:10:43.610
It's orderly, streets are spotless,

01:10:43.610 --> 01:10:44.950
cars slow down,

01:10:44.950 --> 01:10:47.843
which is unheard of in China.

01:10:47.843 --> 01:10:51.060
(dogs barking)

01:10:51.060 --> 01:10:52.980
Words like honesty and credibility

01:10:52.980 --> 01:10:55.210
appear on propaganda posters.

01:10:55.210 --> 01:10:57.980
Display cases show pictures of Rong Chang

01:10:57.980 --> 01:10:59.693
most honored citizens.

01:11:01.620 --> 01:11:03.320
You start with 1000 points,

01:11:03.320 --> 01:11:05.790
and you can print out your report anytime.

01:11:05.790 --> 01:11:09.570
You lose points for things
like jaywalking, littering,

01:11:09.570 --> 01:11:11.270
tossing cigarette butts,

01:11:11.270 --> 01:11:12.563
or spreading rumors.

01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:16.520
Cameras do a lot of the surveillance work,

01:11:16.520 --> 01:11:18.700
but it's pretty analog too

01:11:18.700 --> 01:11:22.494
like posters that list the ways
you can gain or lose points.

01:11:22.494 --> 01:11:23.740
(speaking in foreign language)

01:11:23.740 --> 01:11:25.050
And each night,

01:11:25.050 --> 01:11:28.383
local TV shows the surveillance
highlights of the day.

01:11:29.766 --> 01:11:30.860
(speaks in foreign language)

01:11:30.860 --> 01:11:33.140
And then there's Juan Yi,

01:11:33.140 --> 01:11:35.660
she's an information collector,

01:11:35.660 --> 01:11:37.900
a paid enforcer who walks around

01:11:37.900 --> 01:11:40.228
and writes down deeds about her neighbors.

01:11:40.228 --> 01:11:41.061
(speaks in foreign language)

01:11:41.061 --> 01:11:43.520
Like the man who carried
a drunk person home,

01:11:43.520 --> 01:11:45.417
things like this are good deeds she said.

01:11:45.417 --> 01:11:48.530
But the farmer overheard
swearing and being rude,

01:11:48.530 --> 01:11:50.198
yeah, bad deeds.

01:11:50.198 --> 01:11:51.110
(speaking in foreign language)

01:11:51.110 --> 01:11:53.160
Her quota is 10 a month.

01:11:53.160 --> 01:11:54.350
She likes the work,

01:11:54.350 --> 01:11:55.950
thinks the city's better for it.

01:11:57.797 --> 01:11:59.455
- Will see you on Thursday.

01:11:59.455 --> 01:12:02.749
(students laughing)

01:12:02.749 --> 01:12:05.166
(calm music)

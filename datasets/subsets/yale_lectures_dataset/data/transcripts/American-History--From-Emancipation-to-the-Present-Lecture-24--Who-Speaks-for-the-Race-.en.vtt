00:00:09.667 --> 00:00:16.400
Last week we spent a lot
of time dealing with high

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.967
electoral politics,
canvassing the career of

00:00:18.967 --> 00:00:23.300
Jesse Jackson, scooting past
Ronald Reagan's and George

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.100
Bush's and--presidencies
and the campaign,

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.667
the Bush-Dukakis
campaign, for,

00:00:27.667 --> 00:00:31.767
you know, the Willie
Horton ad and the way,

00:00:31.767 --> 00:00:36.067
and the way in which
racial conversations become

00:00:36.067 --> 00:00:37.600
subverted into
something else,

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.000
although still remaining
quite racial in the context

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
of 1990s
politics, and something,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.267
a process that
began decades earlier,

00:00:45.267 --> 00:00:48.200
certainly, with the
civil rights successes or

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.867
excesses, depending on one's
politics.&nbsp; Much of last

00:00:52.867 --> 00:00:55.167
week's themes were dealing
with the submergence of

00:00:55.167 --> 00:00:59.300
racial discourse and also
the racialization of crime,

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.400
and also the further
development of coalition

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.700
politics as we move to a
much more racially and

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.067
ethnically, ethnically mixed
society.&nbsp; Now in the last

00:01:11.067 --> 00:01:12.400
two lectures of the
course--I can't believe

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.467
we're already here, but we
are--I want to continue with

00:01:14.467 --> 00:01:17.967
my focus on post-civil
rights presidencies and

00:01:17.967 --> 00:01:22.200
public policies, examining
in particular how race

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.167
affected public policy and
how cultural symbols still

00:01:25.167 --> 00:01:27.900
do so many, so much heavy
lifting for a much more

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:34.300
complicated real world in
which we all live.&nbsp; Some of

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.067
the themes of this
week are deal--are,

00:01:36.067 --> 00:01:38.400
are discussions relating
to the presumptions of the

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.400
permanence of
civil rights changes,

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.067
and the presumptions of the
goals of civil rights.&nbsp; You

00:01:44.067 --> 00:01:48.600
know, what is the underlying
presumption of integration?&nbsp;

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.000
What is "the race" and
who speaks for "the race"?&nbsp;

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.567
These are themes you're
going to pick up in your

00:01:54.567 --> 00:01:56.367
reading,
certainly.&nbsp; There will be,

00:01:56.367 --> 00:01:58.400
as you've become accustomed
already in this course,

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.167
overlapping as far as
chronology as well as

00:02:01.167 --> 00:02:03.900
policy, court cases,
and cultural symbols,

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.200
all operating at the same
time in overlapping ways.&nbsp;

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.500
So we left off really in
George Bush's presidency.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.900
I want to pick up in 1992
with Bill Clinton being

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.300
elected to the office.&nbsp;
He's elected with a,

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.867
a--embodying great
Democratic promise.&nbsp; I mean,

00:02:26.867 --> 00:02:29.767
this is after twelve years
of Republicans in control of

00:02:29.767 --> 00:02:32.567
the White House
and, you know,

00:02:32.567 --> 00:02:38.600
a generation of, of younger
people not ever knowing a

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.500
Democrat in the White
House.&nbsp; Bill Clinton comes

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.300
in with an incredible
sense of charisma,

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.100
and it's really, it's
really quite astonishing,

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.300
and a clear natural talent
to speak to black Americans

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.167
in a voice that black
Americans can recognize.&nbsp;

00:02:54.167 --> 00:02:57.200
And for African America, it
becomes a moment of great

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.367
hope in terms of what the
potential--the future might

00:03:00.367 --> 00:03:02.500
hold.

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.467
&nbsp;Clinton makes
a lot of noise,

00:03:04.467 --> 00:03:07.067
and it turns out to
be noise in many ways,

00:03:07.067 --> 00:03:09.900
about his commitment to
making a cabinet and a White

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.167
House
administration that, quote,

00:03:11.167 --> 00:03:13.800
"looked like America."&nbsp; This
is one of his phrases during

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:20.100
the period.&nbsp; Making his
administration look like

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:26.100
America runs into a problem,
when he nominates to the

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.567
position of Assistant
Secretary of Civil Rights

00:03:31.567 --> 00:03:33.967
Professor of Law at the
University of Pennsylvania

00:03:33.967 --> 00:03:38.667
at the time named Lani
Guinier.&nbsp; During this moment

00:03:38.667 --> 00:03:42.100
in the early years of
the Clinton presidency,

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.200
or when he was
president-elect,

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.667
being a friend of
Bill, an "F.O.B.,

00:03:45.667 --> 00:03:47.300
 was a big deal.&nbsp; If you
were a friend of Bill with

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:49.700
all of his connections
and his wife's connections,

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.567
you might have a real in to
becoming part of the White

00:03:51.567 --> 00:03:53.167
House administration.

00:03:53.167 --> 00:03:55.267
&nbsp;Lani, Lani Guinier is
one of these individuals,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.200
goes, you know, goes back
to law school days with the

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:08.400
Clintons.&nbsp; Guinier had been
an advocate for years in,

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.067
in law review articles of
something called "cumulative

00:04:11.067 --> 00:04:14.600
voting," a process that
allowed for greater interest

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:18.000
group representation.&nbsp;
Something along the lines,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.600
and I'm being
verycrude about it,

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:24.900
if there are ten candidates
running for an office,

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.400
you don't just get one vote
under cumulative voting.&nbsp;

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.500
You have ten votes you
spread along the ten

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.900
candidates.&nbsp; Maybe
on a certain issue,

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:35.867
Candidate A really
represents your views.&nbsp; You

00:04:35.867 --> 00:04:37.800
want to give that
person five votes.&nbsp; And on a

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:42.067
certain issue Candidate--I
don't know if I did A or B

00:04:42.067 --> 00:04:45.200
or one or two--another
candidate represents a lot

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.300
of your opinions, so you
want to give that person

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:48.300
three votes.

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:52.100
It's actually a way of
hyper-democratizing who gets

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:56.200
represent--represented in
office.&nbsp; It's a process,

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.400
moreover, and
this is important,

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.000
that the Reagan and Bush
Justice Departments had

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.067
sanctioned in over three
dozen instances.&nbsp; So it

00:05:05.067 --> 00:05:09.100
is--it was an
embrace of democracy,

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:12.300
letting the
little person have a,

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:18.300
a chance to say something,
and it was a process that

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.567
had been embraced by
Republican-nominated or

00:05:21.567 --> 00:05:23.700
controlled
Department of Justice.

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:27.300
However, Bill Clinton,
as much as he excited the

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:31.500
Democratic, liberal base,
he infuriated a conservative

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:34.900
base, and that conservative
base went into attack mode.&nbsp;

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:38.100
There'd been a phrase that
had been really popularized

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:39.800
during Ronald
Reagan's presidency,

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:43.700
and that's this, the phrase
"the spin doctor."&nbsp; Someone

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:46.367
who comes in, who
doctors up the message,

00:05:46.367 --> 00:05:48.800
spins it around, and turns
it into something quite

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:54.667
different.&nbsp; Lani
Guinier is tagged,

00:05:54.667 --> 00:05:58.400
because of her
cumulative voting ideology,

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:02.200
as being a "quota queen" by
conservative media types.&nbsp;

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:06.567
She's a "quota queen."&nbsp; Now
what's the big deal with the

00:06:06.567 --> 00:06:08.300
phrase?&nbsp; The phrase
actually is very clever,

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:15.067
because it links to two
different problems in the

00:06:15.067 --> 00:06:17.800
American present to the
American past.&nbsp; One is this

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.600
direct connotation
of the welfare queen,

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.500
which is a, an, a
catchphrase of the

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:27.367
eighties.&nbsp; Welfare queens
were used as individuals,

00:06:27.367 --> 00:06:29.200
I mean propped up as
individuals who were

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:33.100
bringing down the American
social network and really a

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:35.267
blight on the American
economy.&nbsp; And these were

00:06:35.267 --> 00:06:39.100
depicted as
women, of course,

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:41.300
they were queens,
overwhelmingly African

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:43.700
American, although most
welfare recipients are not

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:46.567
African American,
but people who,

00:06:46.567 --> 00:06:49.200
who capitalized upon the
system and took advantage of

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:51.500
it; that under the logic
of welfare at the time,

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:55.100
the more children you had,
the more aid you received.

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:57.600
Now the story's much
more complicated than this,

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:59.867
but the, the construction
of the image was that the

00:06:59.867 --> 00:07:02.300
welfare queen was the person
responsible for being a real

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:08.400
drain on the system.&nbsp;
So Guinier's politics or

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:11.300
ideology is
linked to excess,

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:13.800
excess of the state with the
welfare queen ideology.&nbsp; But

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:16.800
the quota part's also
important.&nbsp; That links back

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:23.300
earlier than the
Reagan presidency,

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:26.600
by linking it to quotas,
something that had come up

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:30.000
in the Supreme Court case in
Bakke versus the Regents of

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.700
the University
of California,

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:35.067
decided in 1978.&nbsp; The
Supreme Court case had said

00:07:35.067 --> 00:07:36.867
that quotas were
unconstitutional.&nbsp; Now

00:07:36.867 --> 00:07:40.000
Bakke, just in a
super quick nutshell,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.400
Allan Bakke, white man,
sues--applies for University

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:45.367
of California,
Davis medical school,

00:07:45.367 --> 00:07:47.867
isn't admitted.&nbsp; And he
discovers through his

00:07:47.867 --> 00:07:51.267
research that
according to scores,

00:07:51.267 --> 00:07:54.600
in terms of what scores
people received on the MCAT,

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:59.500
that African American/Latino
applicants got in who scored

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:03.000
lower than he did.&nbsp; And then
he also discovered that UC

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.967
Davis, in an attempt to
diversify its student body,

00:08:05.967 --> 00:08:09.767
had created a set-aside
program that had quotas,

00:08:09.767 --> 00:08:11.967
that--and I'm making the
numbers up here--that "we're

00:08:11.967 --> 00:08:15.400
going to admit up to
twenty, or at minimum

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:16.767
twenty"--again,
I don't--the,

00:08:16.767 --> 00:08:20.267
the actual terminology
is not important right

00:08:20.267 --> 00:08:21.700
now--"African
American/Latino medical

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:24.567
students into UC Davis, with
a goal of diversifying our

00:08:24.567 --> 00:08:30.400
population."&nbsp; The Supreme
Court weighs in in 1978

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:35.900
saying that such
set-aside programs,

00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:39.300
mandated numbers,
were unconstitutional.

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:44.900
Okay, there it
is.&nbsp; I had mute on,

00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:50.900
I'm sorry.&nbsp; That you cannot
just pick a number and say

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.567
that that's okay.&nbsp; So
Guinier is linked to the

00:08:56.567 --> 00:08:59.800
excesses of welfare reform
or welfare policies in the

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:02.700
1980s, the excesses of
civil rights ideology,

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:08.300
trying to diversify
America through quotas,

00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:14.800
through the 1970s, decided
in seventy-eight.&nbsp; And

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:18.567
people started
attacking her,

00:09:18.567 --> 00:09:21.567
politicians, activists.&nbsp;
Clinton famously takes

00:09:21.567 --> 00:09:24.100
her--says he's going to take
a retreat to Camp David and

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:27.600
takes her, her law review
articles.&nbsp; He's going to

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:30.900
think about it.&nbsp; And he
comes back from Camp David

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:32.200
saying, you know, "I've
looked at this thing more

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:36.700
carefully, and, you know,
her views are not in line

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:38.700
with the kind of politics
that I want to practice."

00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:42.000
&nbsp;And Clinton
withdraws the nomination,

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.167
even when his
attorney general,

00:09:43.167 --> 00:09:46.500
Janet Reno, said that
Guinier deserved the right

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:48.900
to at least present her
actual views.&nbsp; The views had

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:53.400
been misappropriated.&nbsp; Black
liberals felt cheated by

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:56.767
Clinton as he made a clear
move to the center.&nbsp; They

00:09:56.767 --> 00:10:03.600
felt he was caving in to
conservative politicians and

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:05.367
activists.

00:10:05.367 --> 00:10:06.800
And whether he
was or he wasn't,

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:08.967
Clinton does--I mean on
that case with Lani Guinier,

00:10:08.967 --> 00:10:13.600
Clinton does make a
very clear move to take up

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:15.700
Reagan's strategy of
capture--Reagan captured

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:18.900
the, the moderate
Democrat who was fed up and

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:21.200
frustrated, and brought them
over to the Republican camp;

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:25.300
Clinton went to take them
back.&nbsp; He wanted to capture

00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:27.600
the middle ground
voters in America,

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:29.367
which, as the politics in
this country become more

00:10:29.367 --> 00:10:31.867
conservative, meant a
dramatic turn or a shift to

00:10:31.867 --> 00:10:37.100
the right.&nbsp; Now, in
part, liberals are concerned

00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:40.167
because they see Clinton's
decision as part of a

00:10:40.167 --> 00:10:43.200
general move away from
substantive embrace of civil

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:45.500
rights ideologies and
victories of the late

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:48.700
1960s--of the 1960s.

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:53.400
Clinton, it soon seemed
to these liberals and

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:55.400
activists, was more
willing, more than willing,

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:58.000
to cede ground to
conservatives in order to

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.367
steal some of their
thunder.&nbsp; In fact,

00:11:00.367 --> 00:11:03.167
you, you'd hear activists
during the 1990s being

00:11:03.167 --> 00:11:05.600
frustrated, because Clinton
was saying all these things,

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:07.667
"all these
things" in quotes,

00:11:07.667 --> 00:11:12.167
that Republicans had
been talking about for the

00:11:12.167 --> 00:11:17.800
longest time, but claiming
credit for them.&nbsp; It was a

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:21.167
massive stroke of, of
political leadership,

00:11:21.167 --> 00:11:25.700
even though it certainly
frustrated to no end

00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:28.500
conservatives and
liberals.&nbsp; Now Clinton,

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:32.400
although an individual
who had his weaknesses,

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:34.000
he certainly had
incredible strengths,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.700
and he understood the
ability--he had the ability

00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:40.500
to read the tenor of the
times.&nbsp; It's an era of

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:43.400
repositioning on the
national scene against the

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:49.367
so-called excesses of the
1960s.&nbsp; In this course,

00:11:49.367 --> 00:11:52.700
I spend a lot of time
talking about look--taking a

00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:56.100
critical eye, looking at
southern states and their,

00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:59.000
their policies, states'
versus federal rights,

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.800
for example.&nbsp; And while
other states still have,

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:07.367
or still are quite rich with
complications in terms of

00:12:07.367 --> 00:12:09.600
racial politics, I want
to turn my attention for,

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:12.667
for a little bit to the
West.&nbsp; This is actually a,

00:12:12.667 --> 00:12:14.500
a structural
flaw in the course,

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:16.400
because there's so much
material focusing on the

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:19.300
Southeast.&nbsp; This is a
national problem.&nbsp; For the

00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:23.200
moment, we'll just
focus on the West.&nbsp; It's in

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:24.800
California in the
1990s--It's in California in

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:32.067
the 1990s where America
sees a new frontier in race

00:12:32.067 --> 00:12:35.867
politics, and this is
something that grabs the

00:12:35.867 --> 00:12:38.000
attention of the nation.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.567
I mean, California does
take up a lot of space.

00:12:41.567 --> 00:12:45.267
It grabs the attention of
the nation and also ends up

00:12:45.267 --> 00:12:48.800
writing a cru--a, a, an
interesting chapter in

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:54.100
Clinton's race politics.&nbsp;
I want to talk now about

00:12:54.100 --> 00:13:00.100
propos--two propositions
in the 1990s.&nbsp; One is

00:13:06.267 --> 00:13:11.700
Proposition 187,
called "Save Our State,

00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:14.267
 and the second is
Proposition 209,

00:13:14.267 --> 00:13:20.267
called the "California Civil
Rights Initiative."&nbsp; In

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:30.800
1994--and by the way, I'm
sorry.&nbsp; For those who don't

00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:38.000
know, California has this
allegedly super democratic

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.367
process of changing,
changing the state

00:13:41.367 --> 00:13:43.667
constitution, that if the
citizens of the state garner

00:13:43.667 --> 00:13:47.400
enough signatures, and
they float a proposition to

00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:49.000
change the
state constitution,

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.200
they can act with--they
can enact changes to the

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:55.300
constitution.&nbsp; Now it seems
democratic on its surf--on

00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:58.800
its face, but it's actually
been hijacked--I don't know

00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:01.900
when that started, probably
from the beginning--by very

00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:04.200
strong corporate interest
and political activist

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:07.300
interest on all sides of
the political spectrum,

00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:10.800
that have the resources
to hire people to gather

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:13.367
signatures.&nbsp; Proposition 187
certainly embodied this kind

00:14:13.367 --> 00:14:15.600
of organizing logic.&nbsp;
Again, it's called "Save Our

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:19.300
State."&nbsp; It's a proposition
heavily supported by then

00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:21.767
Governor of
California Pete Wilson,

00:14:21.767 --> 00:14:24.200
someone who'd been a
moderate Republican,

00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:26.300
who turns aggressively
conservative as he

00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:28.200
be--begins to put
out--to cast an eye on a

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:31.000
presidential campaign, a
campaign that ultimately

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:37.100
flops miserably.&nbsp;&nbsp; Everybody
knows that race and economic

00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:39.367
issues are
politically divisive,

00:14:39.367 --> 00:14:42.500
and that way they can be
extremely effective.&nbsp; This

00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:44.200
is what Wilson
identifies in Prop.

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:48.100
187 and sees it as a way to
put his name on the national

00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:49.100
screen.

00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:55.100
Proposition 187 focused
on social services.&nbsp; 187

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:03.900
ended--if, if it
were put--made law,

00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:06.400
would end public
social services,

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:08.967
would end health
services and education for

00:15:08.967 --> 00:15:13.000
undoc--undocumented
immigrants,

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:19.467
illegal aliens, illegal
aliens.&nbsp; So it's ending the

00:15:19.467 --> 00:15:21.100
social
network--the safety net,

00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:24.100
excuse me, and education for
undocumented immigrants.&nbsp;

00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:26.700
And it was about addressing
a fiscal crisis in

00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:30.367
healthcare in the state.&nbsp;
It was a very real crisis,

00:15:30.367 --> 00:15:32.100
but it was also
cast in racial light.

00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:38.400
There was a controversial ad
that showed nighttime border

00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:42.400
crossers.&nbsp; Now they're
non-racialized.&nbsp; No one ever

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:45.900
mentions their race,
the advertiser doesn't,

00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:48.600
but everybody knows that
these are Mexicans crossing

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:53.700
the border at
night.&nbsp; And these unnamed,

00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:56.700
un-raced individuals are
depicted in the ad as a

00:15:56.700 --> 00:15:59.267
pestilent scourge, scourge,
like rats invading the

00:15:59.267 --> 00:16:01.967
house; that they are
coming into our state,

00:16:01.967 --> 00:16:07.800
they are invading it,
they're taking it over.&nbsp; 187

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:10.600
does pass.&nbsp;
"Let's save our state,

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:14.600
by God," but it's caught up
in litigation and ultimately

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:18.400
killed when the moderate
Democrat Grey Davis now the

00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:20.700
become--now the
governor of California,

00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:24.400
dismisses it in
1999.&nbsp; But it takes up,

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:25.600
you know, the
second half of the,

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:27.400
the decade as far as
political energy in the

00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:29.300
state of California.

00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:32.200
At the same time, Prop 187
is winding its way through

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:36.600
the litigation process,
California starts debating

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:39.700
another proposition,
this one in two--in 1996,

00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:40.700
Prop.

00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:44.567
209, the "California Civil
Rights Initiative."&nbsp; Now the

00:16:44.567 --> 00:16:48.400
"California Civil
Rights Initiative" ends

00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:54.100
discrimination against and
preferential treatment for

00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:56.300
any individual or
groups based on race,

00:16:56.300 --> 00:17:00.700
sex, color, ethnicity, or
national origin.&nbsp; So it ends

00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:03.300
discrimination against
individuals or groups,

00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:06.000
based on race, sex,
color, ethnicity,

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.300
or national
origin.&nbsp; This is,

00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:10.100
you know, something very
much in the tradition of the

00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:13.900
civil rights heritage, of
course.&nbsp; But it also kills

00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:19.400
preferential treatment for
the same groups.&nbsp; It is an

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:25.400
anti-affirmative action
proposition.&nbsp; As Prop.

00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:33.500
209 is garnering
its votes, you have,

00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:35.867
in the University of
California system,

00:17:35.867 --> 00:17:38.800
a series of
faculty senate votes,

00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:40.500
you know, for or
against the proposition,

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:44.167
and a, and a state prop--a
state law that's being

00:17:44.167 --> 00:17:46.267
changed that's going to end
affirmative action in the UC

00:17:46.267 --> 00:17:48.100
system, regardless
of what California,

00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:53.600
excuse me, what Prop.

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:58.600
209 does.&nbsp; Affirmative
action's killed in the UC

00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:05.400
system.&nbsp; The numbers of
minorities plummet overnight

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:08.400
in the flagship
schools, like UC Berkeley,

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:09.400
UCLA, UC San Diego.

00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:12.867
I was teaching at UC
San Diego at the time,

00:18:12.867 --> 00:18:17.600
which did--never did have
a large African American

00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:20.167
population, student
population.&nbsp; It's around two

00:18:20.167 --> 00:18:22.467
and a half
percent.&nbsp; Within one year,

00:18:22.467 --> 00:18:26.200
it's cut in half to
one and a half percent.

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:30.500
You have at UCLA and, and
Cal tremendous drops in

00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:32.367
numbers of African
American students in,

00:18:32.367 --> 00:18:35.100
in the college and also in
places like the law school.&nbsp;

00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:42.067
Now what's really important
about the "California Civil

00:18:42.067 --> 00:18:43.800
Rights Initiative" and
the anti-affirmative action

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:45.800
initiatives in the
state is that--well,

00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:50.500
a couple of
different things.&nbsp; There's a

00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:53.500
hyper-focus on race.&nbsp;
People are talking about,

00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:56.800
you know, affirmative action
and "it's going to eliminate

00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:59.400
the black and brown presence
on campuses.&nbsp; It's going to

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:02.467
eliminate the chance for
black and brown people to,

00:19:02.467 --> 00:19:07.800
to have an equal opportunity
to get certain jobs."&nbsp; But

00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:13.567
the group that it affected
the most was white women.&nbsp;

00:19:13.567 --> 00:19:15.400
Since affirmative action
became a federal policy,

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:17.567
white women have
overwhelmingly been the

00:19:17.567 --> 00:19:19.500
group that benefited the
most from affirmative action

00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:23.000
policies, and they would be
the group most negatively

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.500
affected.&nbsp; And yet that
discourse is written out of

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:31.500
the conversation in
California.&nbsp; Also,

00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:35.500
at the same
time, there's a T.V.

00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:38.600
ad appears.&nbsp; It
runs for one day,

00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:40.500
just like the
Willie Horton ad,

00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:44.167
ad runs just a couple of
times in a day.&nbsp; The T.V.

00:19:44.167 --> 00:19:46.767
ad runs for one day that
claims that Martin Luther

00:19:46.767 --> 00:19:51.467
King would have
supported Proposition 209,

00:19:51.467 --> 00:19:54.900
taking a few lines from
his famous speeches and

00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:58.267
misrepresenting
them.&nbsp; In fact,

00:19:58.267 --> 00:19:59.800
King had gone on the
record saying that he was in

00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:02.967
support of these minority
set-aside programs then,

00:20:02.967 --> 00:20:04.167
soon to be called
affirmative action

00:20:04.167 --> 00:20:10.167
programs.&nbsp; Jesse Jackson
is horrified that these two

00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:14.167
professors at
Berkeley, I believe,

00:20:14.167 --> 00:20:17.267
who organized this ad
campaign were the ones

00:20:17.267 --> 00:20:19.367
behind the logic of the
"California Civil Rights

00:20:19.367 --> 00:20:21.967
Initiative," that they would
misappropriate King in that

00:20:21.967 --> 00:20:24.200
way.&nbsp; They
weren't the first,

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:26.600
and they
wouldn't be the last,

00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:28.367
but it's an
important sort of legacy,

00:20:28.367 --> 00:20:35.100
or wrestling with the memory
of who people like King

00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:39.400
were.&nbsp; Then you have the
issue of the name itself.&nbsp;

00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:42.267
It's the "California Civil
Rights Initiative."&nbsp; In our

00:20:42.267 --> 00:20:45.400
post-civil rights age, when
we are all enlightened on

00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:48.667
racial issues, so our
general feeling goes,

00:20:48.667 --> 00:20:51.800
who's going to be against
civil rights?&nbsp; People don't

00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:54.600
want to be against civil
rights.&nbsp; They don't want to

00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:57.400
be considered racist, after
all.&nbsp; And so when people go

00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:01.300
into the ballot
booth, the election booth,

00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:05.367
and vote, it turns out
Calif--Proposition 209,

00:21:05.367 --> 00:21:08.800
the "California Civ--Civil
Rights Initiative,

00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:12.500
 essentially sails through,
and it enjoys a majority of

00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:17.067
African American support,
enjoys a major--majority of

00:21:17.067 --> 00:21:20.100
support from white women,
and I believe--I'm just,

00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:21.900
I don't have my notes on
this issue in front of me,

00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:24.500
so I'm not going to
vouch for it for certain,

00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:27.900
but I think it receives a
majority of Mexican American

00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:29.800
support as well.&nbsp;
If not a majority,

00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:33.000
the numbers are high.&nbsp; When
asked about these issues,

00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:37.800
white women responded that
they didn't realize that the

00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:40.700
civ--civil rights initiative
would actually--was a vote

00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:44.300
against their own
self-interest.&nbsp; African

00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:46.700
Americans made it clear,
"We're for civil rights."&nbsp;

00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:51.767
They hadn't read the
proposition.&nbsp; And Mexican

00:21:51.767 --> 00:21:55.400
Americans supported it as
well for curious reasons.&nbsp;

00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:59.967
They support civil rights,
but they also saw this way

00:21:59.967 --> 00:22:04.167
of, of supporting this
platform as a way to

00:22:04.167 --> 00:22:06.300
"Americanize" themselves,
even though they already had

00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:11.100
American citizenship
status.&nbsp; So what--taking all

00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:12.800
of these things together,
what does it actually lead

00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:16.700
us to?&nbsp; It leads us to a
point where we are today,

00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:22.367
frankly, of a general
dumbing down of discourse in

00:22:22.367 --> 00:22:25.000
politics and
media about race,

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.667
and a gen--general
laziness as well amongst the

00:22:27.667 --> 00:22:29.100
electorate when it comes
to thinking about these

00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:35.100
things.&nbsp; Now it doesn't help
this process when you have

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:45.567
people making editorial
decisions that play to our

00:22:45.567 --> 00:22:47.400
low--lowest common
denominator.&nbsp; And this

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:53.467
really is a theme of the
American political thought,

00:22:53.467 --> 00:22:55.700
social and cultural thought,
of the last twenty or thirty

00:22:55.700 --> 00:22:58.900
years, lowest common
denominator does a really

00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:02.800
great job of appearing
first.&nbsp; So it doesn't help

00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:06.200
us become more astute
thinkers about race and

00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:09.100
citizenship and belonging
in politics when you have

00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:12.367
people making editorial
decisions that capitalize

00:23:12.367 --> 00:23:16.767
upon racialized notions
of blacks as criminal,

00:23:16.767 --> 00:23:20.567
for instance.&nbsp; Just, just
take this--this is all the

00:23:20.567 --> 00:23:25.400
attention that I'm
going to pay to the O.J.

00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:28.000
Simpson case, although
it captivates the United

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:33.700
States.&nbsp; The picture you see
on your left is the picture

00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:35.100
that ran in Time
magazine of O.J.

00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:40.200
Simpson.&nbsp; The actual picture
is the one on the right.&nbsp;

00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:42.700
Now people know what O.J.

00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:46.200
Simpson looks like, okay,
and this is not a poor--I

00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:48.500
mean, it's, it's, it's
not a high-quality image,

00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:50.467
but it's not appearing
darker because it's being

00:23:50.467 --> 00:23:52.567
projected.&nbsp; That
is a darkened,

00:23:52.567 --> 00:23:55.567
clearly darkened,
picture of O.J.

00:23:55.567 --> 00:23:57.900
Simpson.&nbsp; So
when the cover ran,

00:23:57.900 --> 00:24:00.500
people were like, "That
seems a little--I don't

00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:04.100
think O.J.'s that dark."&nbsp;
And then someone got a hold

00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:09.200
of the actual print from the
mug shot.&nbsp; People were up in

00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:10.200
arms.

00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:13.600
"What are you
doing?"&nbsp; The response was,

00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:17.300
"Well, by Photoshopping
things a little bit,

00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:19.367
it made the image
pop."&nbsp; That was the quote,

00:24:19.367 --> 00:24:23.300
"it made the image pop."&nbsp; It
was a better image.&nbsp; As if

00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:25.100
anybody needed to have
a better image of O.J.

00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:28.267
Simpson.&nbsp; It wasn't
like he was a mystery,

00:24:28.267 --> 00:24:30.967
and no matter what you felt
about what he did or didn't

00:24:30.967 --> 00:24:33.667
do, you're still going
to buy the magazine cover

00:24:33.667 --> 00:24:35.600
whether you're going to
have a light image or a dark

00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:36.600
image of O.J.

00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:41.400
Simpson.&nbsp; The young
editor, photographic editor,

00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:43.567
wasn't around much
longer, I believe,

00:24:43.567 --> 00:24:45.900
at Time, but he was probably
taking the fall for some

00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:49.800
other editorial
decision.&nbsp; Anyway,

00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:52.167
our national discourse
is one that's become

00:24:52.167 --> 00:24:54.400
increasingly impoverished,
and we're still in that

00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:59.900
moment in our leisurely
"post-racial" today.&nbsp; But

00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:02.267
it's in this
state of affairs,

00:25:02.267 --> 00:25:05.800
getting back to Clinton now,
with Proposition "Save Our

00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:07.400
State," Proposition
"California Civil Rights

00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:08.400
Initiative," O.J.

00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:12.167
Simpson in that
bizarre moment,

00:25:12.167 --> 00:25:17.767
it's in this state of
affairs that Bill Clinton

00:25:17.767 --> 00:25:19.167
travels to
University of California,

00:25:19.167 --> 00:25:22.800
San Diego for its
graduation ceremony in 1997,

00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:26.367
and while there, announces a
new presidential initiative,

00:25:26.367 --> 00:25:28.800
"a National
Dialogue on Race,

00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:32.400
 or "the One America,"
or "the President's Race

00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:34.500
Initiative," or "a National
Conversation on Race."&nbsp; It

00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:36.000
had all these different
titles.&nbsp; It was all the same

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:41.400
thing.&nbsp; Clinton wanted to do
something really--many of us

00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:45.200
thought that was really
astonishing.&nbsp; Recognizing

00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:46.900
that there was an
impoverished state of affair

00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:50.500
in our national conversation
about race--this is a person

00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:53.967
who grows up in the South,
grows up around African

00:25:53.967 --> 00:25:58.500
Americans, can speak in a
vernacular diction that was

00:25:58.500 --> 00:26:00.567
reminiscent, or
sounded familiar to African

00:26:00.567 --> 00:26:06.067
Americans.&nbsp; This is a person
who got black America and

00:26:06.067 --> 00:26:08.600
was tremendously popular
amongst black Americans,

00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:10.567
even despite Lani Guinier
and other missteps along the

00:26:10.567 --> 00:26:14.200
way.&nbsp; People thought, "Wow,
Clinton's actually going to

00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:17.300
do something here."&nbsp; He is
better positioned than any

00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:22.700
other President since Jimmy
Carter to do this.&nbsp; The idea

00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:24.800
is, we're going to have town
hall meetings all across the

00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:32.167
country where members
of Clinton's Blue Ribbon

00:26:32.167 --> 00:26:34.667
Committee, chaired by the
late historian John Hope

00:26:34.667 --> 00:26:38.900
Franklin, path breaking
historian of many--for many

00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:41.467
reasons but, most famously,
for breaking so many color

00:26:41.467 --> 00:26:45.467
lines as a black historian.&nbsp;
Now you had these town hall

00:26:45.467 --> 00:26:49.000
meetings across the country
to talk about our current

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:53.867
conversation about race.&nbsp; A
lot of really smart people

00:26:53.867 --> 00:26:55.267
on this committee; it
seemed like a moment of real

00:26:55.267 --> 00:26:59.100
promise.&nbsp; And the moment
kind of implodes right away

00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:01.300
when the commission comes
together to sort of organize

00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:08.200
itself and Angela Oh, a
Korean attorney in Los

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:12.000
Angeles, tremendously strong
record when it comes to

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:16.500
civil rights law, she
clashes immediately with

00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:18.800
John Hope Franklin.&nbsp; She has
an incredibly strong record

00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:21.200
on civil rights
activism and scholarship,

00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:26.800
and the clash was
about how, in 1997,

00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:30.500
'98, should America talk
about race?&nbsp; Franklin was

00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:33.400
saying, "You must start with
slavery.&nbsp; Everything comes

00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:36.767
from that, that
everything--every kind of

00:27:36.767 --> 00:27:39.000
conversation comes with
that."&nbsp; Angela Oh says,

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.200
"You start from slavery,
you are eliminating from the

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:46.100
conversation
millions, Chinese,

00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:48.800
Japanese, and Koreans and
people from other different

00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:50.800
parts of the world who
don't have part of that

00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:55.700
experience."&nbsp; And
in so many ways,

00:27:55.700 --> 00:27:58.100
they're both exactly right,
so how do you resolve this?&nbsp;

00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:01.600
Well, it turns out you
don't.&nbsp; The commission

00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:03.667
effectively becomes
a, a dead letter,

00:28:03.667 --> 00:28:06.067
had a few conversations.&nbsp;
Nothing much comes of it.&nbsp;

00:28:06.067 --> 00:28:07.767
Clinton's
philandering, his denial,

00:28:07.767 --> 00:28:10.900
and his impeachment, serves
as a profound distraction

00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:17.800
and sinks his second term.&nbsp;
So the conversation becomes

00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:23.667
a muted conversation, muted
by the impeachment trial if

00:28:23.667 --> 00:28:27.300
nothing else.&nbsp; Clinton's
impeachment trial was not

00:28:27.300 --> 00:28:29.000
the only important court
case of the nineties.&nbsp; And I

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:34.300
want to spend what time I
have left talking about some

00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:35.600
of these court cases,
because it brings us

00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:38.767
really--it brings us to a
campus.&nbsp; It brings us to our

00:28:38.767 --> 00:28:44.400
fairly current moment.&nbsp; I
want to talk about four

00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:49.567
court cases, three from the
1990s and one from 2003.&nbsp;

00:28:55.067 --> 00:28:56.400
Most of them are
Supreme Court cases,

00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:59.500
not all of them though.&nbsp;
The first one is Shaw v.

00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:02.900
Reno, v.

00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:05.867
Reno, against the attorney
general of the United

00:29:05.867 --> 00:29:10.000
States, Janet Reno, and it
involved redistricting in

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:15.300
North Carolina,
congressional districts.&nbsp;

00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:19.500
The federal government
required North Carolina,

00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:24.167
the state, the legislature,
to create another district

00:29:24.167 --> 00:29:27.000
that would guarantee a black
majority.&nbsp; North Carolina's

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.000
not an unusual southern
state with large black

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:30.700
populations, but
also clustered black

00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:34.900
populations.&nbsp; And it wasn't
unusual among southern

00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:37.500
states in that districts
were set up in such a way

00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:41.000
that the black vote
was, was watered down,

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:42.500
thinned out.&nbsp; The
federal government,

00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:44.400
the federal government
said, "North Carolina,

00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:46.667
you need to get
your act together.

00:29:46.667 --> 00:29:49.200
You need to create
another district that will

00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:51.900
have--create the chance
to elect a black person in

00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:53.967
office--put a black person
in office.&nbsp; We need a black

00:29:53.967 --> 00:29:59.767
majority district."&nbsp; It
would be the new twelfth

00:29:59.767 --> 00:30:01.000
district in North Carolina.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:05.200
The district was formed, and
then a suit was brought by

00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:07.567
those who felt the district
was a result of racial

00:30:07.567 --> 00:30:11.600
gerrymandering.&nbsp;
Racial gerrymandering,

00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:15.700
in this case, in support
of an African American

00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:18.867
political presence.&nbsp; Racial
gerrymandering had always

00:30:18.867 --> 00:30:23.867
been trying to eliminate a
black political presence,

00:30:23.867 --> 00:30:27.967
in talking about black-white
issues.&nbsp; Now there are

00:30:27.967 --> 00:30:30.500
several key issues that come
up in the decision in Shaw

00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:31.500
v.

00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:35.800
Reno.&nbsp; It was decided in
1993.&nbsp; One key issue is that

00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:40.900
race is now a suspect
category.&nbsp;&nbsp; You know,

00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:43.000
there was a slide a,
a little while ago,

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.900
I, I, I realized I, I left
it a little bit too early

00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:51.700
in, in Bakke.&nbsp; Actually, let
me just--one point I forgot

00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:56.167
to mention that's very
important right now: quotas

00:30:56.167 --> 00:30:59.367
cannot be
considered in application,

00:30:59.367 --> 00:31:01.667
but race can be considered
as one of the key factors in

00:31:01.667 --> 00:31:03.100
admissions.&nbsp; So
Bakke's point,

00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:04.867
one of the
things Bakke does,

00:31:04.867 --> 00:31:07.800
he says, "We can think about
race when it comes to sort

00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:12.800
of adjudicating the limits,
the parameters of racial

00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:17.600
belonging."&nbsp; All right, just
keep that fact in mind.&nbsp; In

00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:18.600
Shaw v.

00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:21.700
Reno, the Supreme Court says
race is a suspect category.&nbsp;

00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:25.300
"We've come a long way since
the challenges of the 1960s

00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:27.400
and we need to think a
little more carefully about

00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:33.400
when race is used."&nbsp; The
Voting Rights Act says that

00:31:36.900 --> 00:31:39.500
people had to consider
issues of race when setting

00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:44.900
up jurisdictions, and Shaw
says you just can't.&nbsp; So

00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:49.200
Shaw starts to chip away at
the Voting Rights Act.&nbsp; And

00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:52.667
it comes up with a
resolution: that race cannot

00:31:52.667 --> 00:31:57.200
be the predominant factor
in deciding something like

00:31:57.200 --> 00:32:02.500
voting districts, but it can
be considered.&nbsp; So this is

00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:05.400
something in line with Bakke
but a little bit different.&nbsp;

00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:07.100
Race can be considered but
can't be the predominant

00:32:07.100 --> 00:32:10.500
factor; it is a suspect
category.&nbsp; And this is the

00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:12.700
most important phrase:
there must be a compelling

00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:16.700
government interest to
justify considering race.&nbsp;

00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:21.100
So Shaw v.

00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:22.600
Reno is really
asking, "How do we,

00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:24.867
how do we take race into
consideration when we're

00:32:24.867 --> 00:32:29.500
setting up public policy?"&nbsp;
It challenges the Voting

00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:31.600
Rights Act of '65, so it's
chipping away at part of

00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:33.900
it.&nbsp; There must be a
compelling government

00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:41.800
interest.&nbsp; Now this is
the twelfth district,

00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:44.800
I'm going to show you in a
second.&nbsp; And I'll confess,

00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:46.200
I remember there was
a, there was a recent

00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:47.500
resolution on this
last year about--it,

00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:50.000
it came back again, I
confess I don't even recall

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.600
what the decision was, but
in '93 this is what people

00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:57.100
were fighting against, the
twelfth district.&nbsp; See it

00:32:57.100 --> 00:33:03.000
right there, that little
thing?&nbsp; Certainly a suspect

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:04.900
shape.&nbsp; I mean, districts
are always weird looking

00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:09.400
anyway, following
rivers or sort of,

00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:13.700
census tracts.&nbsp; District 12,
and it's actually thicker

00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:16.600
here on the map
than it is in reality,

00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:18.900
in the proposal, because
sometimes it just ran along

00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:21.200
the highway.&nbsp; There's
no people living on the

00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:24.967
highway.&nbsp; So it would go
from one black neighborhood

00:33:24.967 --> 00:33:27.867
to another black
neighborhood.&nbsp; Now the

00:33:27.867 --> 00:33:29.800
supposition of course is
that black folks will vote

00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:33.700
for black
people.&nbsp; And that's,

00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:35.100
that's something you
can talk about in your

00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:37.867
discussion section.&nbsp; That's
a whole other kind of thorny

00:33:37.867 --> 00:33:42.600
briar patch of
presumptions.&nbsp; So North

00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:44.600
Carolina's proposed 12th
Congressional District,

00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:49.000
it certainly looks awfully
strange.&nbsp; Going forward,

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:52.300
1995, Adarand v.

00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:57.167
Peña.&nbsp; It's a case
in Colorado.&nbsp; Adarand

00:33:57.167 --> 00:34:00.600
Construction versus
Peña, who's the secretary of

00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:02.600
agri--transportation,
excuse me.

00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:07.667
Up to this point, federal
agencies had given financial

00:34:07.667 --> 00:34:10.400
incentives to those
contractors who hire

00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:15.767
minority-controlled
subcontractors.&nbsp; So if you

00:34:15.767 --> 00:34:17.300
want to build
something, and you're a,

00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:21.400
say a contractor, I get a
bonus if I start looking for

00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:25.167
minority-owned firms to help
do some of the work that I'm

00:34:25.167 --> 00:34:27.500
supporting.&nbsp; And in
this particular case,

00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:30.667
Adarand, a white-owned
construction firm,

00:34:30.667 --> 00:34:36.867
submitted the lowest bid on
a contract for a highway,

00:34:36.867 --> 00:34:40.800
but not, but did not get the
contract.&nbsp; The contract went

00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:47.400
instead to a minority-owned
firm.&nbsp; So the Supreme Court

00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:53.600
holds, the Supreme Court
holds that race can only be

00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:56.800
used if there's a
compelling interest,

00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:57.967
that builds off of Shaw v.

00:34:57.967 --> 00:35:02.600
Reno, and then that the
government agency using

00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:05.867
racial distribution must do
so under strict scrutiny,

00:35:05.867 --> 00:35:10.500
another one of these
great Supreme Court phrases,

00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:12.800
and it must be used in a
narrowly tailored way.&nbsp;

00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:21.400
Compelling
interest, strict scrutiny,

00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:26.267
narrowly tailored.&nbsp; What
you have in Adarand v.

00:35:26.267 --> 00:35:31.467
Peña is again a narrowing of
the option to use race.&nbsp; You

00:35:31.467 --> 00:35:33.767
got a incred--you have to
have an incredibly strong

00:35:33.767 --> 00:35:36.600
case if you're
going to press a,

00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:39.267
quote, "racial iss--issue"
and hope to have it

00:35:39.267 --> 00:35:45.267
succeed.&nbsp; 1996,
state of Texas,

00:35:48.667 --> 00:35:50.667
it's not a
Supreme Court case.

00:35:52.900 --> 00:35:53.900
In Hopwood v.

00:35:53.900 --> 00:35:58.100
Texas, the University of
Texas law school had been

00:35:58.100 --> 00:36:01.267
aiming, a tradition of
aiming to admit a class that

00:36:01.267 --> 00:36:05.600
looked like Texas.&nbsp; And
it actually changed its

00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:10.700
admission formula to
benefit black and Latino

00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:15.600
applicants.&nbsp; Cheryl
Hopwood, the plaintiff,

00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:18.367
is one of four
people, all white,

00:36:18.367 --> 00:36:23.300
who were denied admission
and then sued.&nbsp; The district

00:36:23.300 --> 00:36:25.567
court sides with the
University of Texas,

00:36:25.567 --> 00:36:28.000
saying they can set their
own admissions policy.&nbsp; They

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.000
haven't offended the
logic that was announced in

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:33.500
Bakke.&nbsp; The appeals court
took the plaintiffs' side

00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:42.000
and in Hopwood, it says race
cannot be used as a plus

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:48.067
factor in the consideration
of applications.&nbsp; So Texas

00:36:48.067 --> 00:36:50.300
didn't use quotas.&nbsp;
That's unconstitutional,

00:36:50.300 --> 00:36:53.767
can't do it.&nbsp; But it
did say--you know,

00:36:53.767 --> 00:36:55.600
I'm making up the numbers
in the schematic--if one

00:36:55.600 --> 00:36:58.300
hundred points is what you
need to get admitted to the

00:36:58.300 --> 00:37:00.500
University of
Texas law school,

00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:01.900
if you're African American,
we're going to give you ten

00:37:01.900 --> 00:37:06.700
more points.&nbsp; It helps boost
your score.&nbsp; And this is

00:37:06.700 --> 00:37:09.200
actually a practice used by
many universities across the

00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:10.500
country.&nbsp; I
know it's u--used,

00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:13.900
used by the University of
California--they gave a bump

00:37:13.900 --> 00:37:15.500
up to those
from historically

00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:18.100
underrepresented groups.&nbsp;
It also gave a bump up for

00:37:18.100 --> 00:37:20.400
veterans, and it gave
a bump up for other,

00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:24.000
other populations as well.&nbsp;
But it was racial and ethnic

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:31.967
minorities who become the
focus of this excess.&nbsp; So if

00:37:31.967 --> 00:37:36.500
you take Bakke as
the foundation,

00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:37.500
you add Shaw v.

00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:38.900
Reno, you take
Adarand versus Peña,

00:37:38.900 --> 00:37:41.867
you take
Hopwood versus Texas,

00:37:41.867 --> 00:37:47.400
you have a situation where
the very premise of Bakke,

00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:50.700
which eliminated quotas
but said race could be used,

00:37:50.700 --> 00:37:52.567
so it supported
affirmative action,

00:37:52.567 --> 00:37:55.667
the premise of Bakke is
being stripped away.&nbsp; The

00:37:55.667 --> 00:37:57.900
Voting Rights Act is being
narrowed in terms of how it

00:37:57.900 --> 00:38:02.667
can be applied, and now
sort of ground zero for the

00:38:02.667 --> 00:38:08.900
debate is university
admissions policies.&nbsp; This

00:38:08.900 --> 00:38:13.967
is why the stakes were
so high in 2003 at the

00:38:13.967 --> 00:38:15.967
University of Michigan.

00:38:17.967 --> 00:38:23.967
In 1997, in 1997, Barbara
Grutter had applied to the

00:38:31.867 --> 00:38:35.400
University of Michigan
law school and been denied

00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:38.800
admission.&nbsp; The law school
freely admitted that it used

00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:41.800
race in its admission as
a compelling interest to

00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:44.967
achieve diversity.&nbsp; It used
that word that they knew

00:38:44.967 --> 00:38:49.200
was--I mean, it's law
school.&nbsp; Compelling interest

00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:51.700
is actually--that would
survive a litmus test,

00:38:51.700 --> 00:38:56.867
so they felt.&nbsp; But
the question was,

00:38:56.867 --> 00:38:59.367
does the University of
Michigan law school,

00:38:59.367 --> 00:39:03.000
did its use of preferences
in student admissions

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:05.400
violate the equal protection
clause of the Fourteenth

00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:07.967
Amendment or the Civil
Rights Act of '64?&nbsp; These

00:39:07.967 --> 00:39:11.600
were the questions before
the court.&nbsp; Now I said

00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:15.200
1997.&nbsp; This thing is
bouncing around until the

00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:21.200
court decides it in 2003.&nbsp;
The lead-up to the Supreme

00:39:23.700 --> 00:39:25.967
Court decision was
really quite fascinating,

00:39:25.967 --> 00:39:30.200
because it tells a story of
our contemporary political

00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:32.200
and capital--corporate
culture as it,

00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:35.600
as it comes to affirmative
action.&nbsp; You have friends of

00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:38.367
the court, petitions being
filed by a whole bunch of

00:39:38.367 --> 00:39:43.667
people, and you have a
really fascinating coalition

00:39:43.667 --> 00:39:50.100
being formed by corporate
interests and retired

00:39:50.100 --> 00:39:54.600
military generals, that if
one takes a stereotype in

00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:57.300
mind, they think, "well
these are very conservative

00:39:57.300 --> 00:40:01.700
populations."&nbsp; These are the
groups that were very much

00:40:01.700 --> 00:40:03.300
in favor of University
of Michigan's admissions

00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:05.900
policy, very much in
favor of affirmative action,

00:40:05.900 --> 00:40:11.100
the military actually being
one of the great places for

00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:17.100
diversifying management
structures.&nbsp; I'm not saying

00:40:17.100 --> 00:40:20.000
it's perfect; no place is.&nbsp;
But the military had done

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:23.567
more than many other
institutions to diversify

00:40:23.567 --> 00:40:27.800
itself over the course of
the previous forty years.&nbsp;

00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:29.500
And
corporations recognizing,

00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:31.167
if you go back
to Jesse Jackson,

00:40:31.167 --> 00:40:37.000
and his Operation PUSH, and
his boycotts of companies

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:39.100
like Coca-Cola
and Anheuser-Busch,

00:40:39.100 --> 00:40:42.867
corporations recognizing,
"We need to have a pool of

00:40:42.867 --> 00:40:48.200
talent that we can tap into
for management positions,

00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:51.267
so we can tap into markets
and make more money."&nbsp; This

00:40:51.267 --> 00:40:52.767
is what the corporations
were trying to do,

00:40:52.767 --> 00:40:57.200
of course.&nbsp; "We need to
preserve affirmative action

00:40:57.200 --> 00:41:00.500
policies, as long as
there aren't quotas,

00:41:00.500 --> 00:41:05.700
wherever we can find them."&nbsp;
George Bush White House

00:41:05.700 --> 00:41:13.400
comes out in support of
the plaintiffs.&nbsp; The Supreme

00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:19.400
Court weighs in, and it
has a mixed answer.&nbsp; People

00:41:21.700 --> 00:41:27.700
didn't know what was going
to happen.&nbsp; The mixed answer

00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:32.200
is that student body
diversity is a compelling

00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:37.667
state interest in the
context of university

00:41:37.667 --> 00:41:38.900
admissions, of
university admissions.&nbsp; It's

00:41:38.900 --> 00:41:45.700
compelling.&nbsp; Race can
therefore be a factor in

00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:47.067
consideration of
the application,

00:41:47.067 --> 00:41:49.400
as long as its use is
narrowly tailored.&nbsp; So you

00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:51.167
see, you know, it's building
on the language of the court

00:41:51.167 --> 00:41:55.400
cases I was already talking
about.&nbsp; It reaffirms,

00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:56.400
therefore--Grutter v.

00:41:56.400 --> 00:42:02.200
Bollinger reaffirms Bakke,
maintains a narrow framework

00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:04.800
in which to understand
Bakke.&nbsp; But then Sandra Day

00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:07.600
O'Connor says, and does
something rather unusual

00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:09.800
that she's since
distanced herself from,

00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:13.600
she goes, "You know, we
need this now."&nbsp; You know,

00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:18.000
one of the issues
with conservatives,

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:19.300
and this is something that,
that--oh I just drew a blank

00:42:19.300 --> 00:42:25.300
on his name.&nbsp; It doesn't
really matter.&nbsp; This is a,

00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:32.167
a, an ideology that many
conservatives are saying,

00:42:32.167 --> 00:42:35.600
"Look, it's been thirty and
forty years since the civil

00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:39.167
rights movement.&nbsp; That's
enough time."&nbsp; And liberals

00:42:39.167 --> 00:42:41.200
would say, "Ah, what about
the previous two hundred?"&nbsp;

00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:46.667
Well, anyway, Sandra
Day O'Connor says,

00:42:46.667 --> 00:42:48.800
"Yeah, we've
come a long way,

00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:50.900
but we're still not perfect
as a society in this issue.&nbsp;

00:42:50.900 --> 00:42:54.500
In twenty-five years--I
think about twenty-five

00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:56.100
years is about right."&nbsp; How
she came up with a number,

00:42:56.100 --> 00:43:00.700
I have no idea.&nbsp; "But
in twenty-five years,

00:43:00.700 --> 00:43:06.100
it will probably be time to
revisit this question."&nbsp; And

00:43:06.100 --> 00:43:09.300
you can bet, well before
twenty-five years is up I'm

00:43:09.300 --> 00:43:13.267
sure, but if by some miracle
it's not challenged within

00:43:13.267 --> 00:43:16.600
twenty-five years, you
better believe that there'll

00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:19.000
be a twenty-fifth
anniversary of suits against

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:20.600
affirmative action,
and college admissions,

00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:27.700
and, and wherever else
it's articulated.&nbsp; So the

00:43:27.700 --> 00:43:29.567
University of Michigan law
school had to actually scrap

00:43:29.567 --> 00:43:32.367
its policy.&nbsp; The University
of Michigan had a slightly

00:43:32.367 --> 00:43:33.867
different policy that
supported affirmative action

00:43:33.867 --> 00:43:36.000
in diversifying its
pop--student population,

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:39.600
was able to keep
it.&nbsp; Now collectively,

00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:45.300
these cases demonstrate
how race works in a legal

00:43:45.300 --> 00:43:51.900
setting since the civil
rights triumphs of the

00:43:51.900 --> 00:43:54.967
1960s.&nbsp; Something
interesting has happened in

00:43:54.967 --> 00:43:56.500
these cases, though.

00:43:56.500 --> 00:44:02.567
In each of these cases,
white plaintiffs were the

00:44:02.567 --> 00:44:06.400
ones who were filing suit,
claiming their equal rights

00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:11.800
had been violated.&nbsp; This is
sort of the fascinating turn

00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:15.800
in civil rights law,
equal protection law,

00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:18.600
in the nineties, in the
eighties into the nineties.&nbsp;

00:44:20.967 --> 00:44:21.967
Something that
was encouraged,

00:44:21.967 --> 00:44:23.267
by the way, by
Clarence Thomas,

00:44:23.267 --> 00:44:25.667
when he was the
head of the EEOC,

00:44:25.667 --> 00:44:27.167
that became an
organization--it was put

00:44:27.167 --> 00:44:29.067
there by Ronald Reagan--it
was an organization that

00:44:29.067 --> 00:44:33.300
actually ended up becoming
non-functioning as far as

00:44:33.300 --> 00:44:39.700
supporting claims for
racial discrimination,

00:44:39.700 --> 00:44:43.300
ethnic discrimination, and
gender discrimination.&nbsp; The

00:44:43.300 --> 00:44:48.667
backlog is tens of thousands
of cases.&nbsp; But we're in a

00:44:48.667 --> 00:44:53.667
moment in the 1990s where
the equal protection clause

00:44:53.667 --> 00:44:57.500
of, of the Fourteenth
Amendment is used often and

00:44:57.500 --> 00:44:59.367
to great effect by
civil rights advocates

00:44:59.367 --> 00:45:03.667
over--especially the height
of the movement in the

00:45:03.667 --> 00:45:10.400
fifties and sixties--has now
a much narrower application

00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:14.000
and is used with greater
success to roll back some of

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:16.200
the more controversial
gains of the civil rights

00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:18.700
movement.&nbsp; So in a
sense, the civil,

00:45:18.700 --> 00:45:22.100
civil rights laws are being
used against the policies

00:45:22.100 --> 00:45:25.600
promulgated by civil rights
activism when you get into

00:45:25.600 --> 00:45:27.667
the 1990s.

00:45:27.667 --> 00:45:30.767
&nbsp; All of this
begs the question,

00:45:30.767 --> 00:45:36.500
is, how race is used in our
society.&nbsp; This will really

00:45:36.500 --> 00:45:38.500
be the lecture--the
topic of the final lecture,

00:45:38.500 --> 00:45:44.200
but it's important to
understand the passions.&nbsp; I

00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:46.400
mean, I've been talking
about them in sort of a

00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:49.700
clinical way that you see
in Supreme Court cases,

00:45:49.700 --> 00:45:54.367
federal court cases,
the last twenty or thirty

00:45:54.367 --> 00:45:58.100
minutes.&nbsp; But the passion of
how people use and--use and

00:45:58.100 --> 00:46:03.400
abuse race hasn't diminished
in the wake of the civil

00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:05.867
rights
victories of the 1960s,

00:46:05.867 --> 00:46:08.367
when the civil
rights excesses--again,

00:46:08.367 --> 00:46:12.667
based on your
politics.&nbsp; In the 1970s,

00:46:12.667 --> 00:46:15.900
for instance, in Boston,
Mass.--I already talked

00:46:15.900 --> 00:46:20.600
about the Stuart case in
Boston in the nineties.&nbsp; But

00:46:20.600 --> 00:46:24.800
Boston has a nasty history
when it comes to racial and

00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:32.100
ethnic politics.&nbsp; White
ethnic communities in Boston

00:46:32.100 --> 00:46:35.867
are up in arms.&nbsp; There's a
new policy about busing.

00:46:35.867 --> 00:46:37.700
They were going to take
black kids in Boston--this

00:46:37.700 --> 00:46:40.200
is a highly segregated
city--and bring them into,

00:46:40.200 --> 00:46:43.300
quote "our schools" and
ship "our kids" out to black

00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:47.500
schools.&nbsp; "This is an
atrocity."&nbsp; So you have

00:46:47.500 --> 00:46:52.800
gangs of angry white ethnic
Bostonians attacking school

00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:58.200
buses with children in them,
hurling epithets left and

00:46:58.200 --> 00:47:04.200
right, and acting in the
most strug--disturbing kinds

00:47:07.167 --> 00:47:11.200
of ways, when you think
about the politics of racial

00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:13.000
symbolism and
citizenship.&nbsp; I mean,

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:15.167
these are some of the core
themes with which I began

00:47:15.167 --> 00:47:21.400
this course.&nbsp;
Theodore Landsmark,

00:47:21.400 --> 00:47:27.800
an African American man,
graduates from Yale with a

00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:28.800
J.D.

00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:34.267
in '73, a degree in
architecture in '76.&nbsp; Up in

00:47:34.267 --> 00:47:38.800
Boston, he's
walking out of City Hall,

00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:44.100
a well-dressed man,
three-piece suit,

00:47:44.100 --> 00:47:48.000
very professional.&nbsp; At least
until recently--he still may

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:50.700
be--the
president of a, of a,

00:47:50.700 --> 00:47:56.167
of an arts university in
Boston.&nbsp; He steps out into

00:47:56.167 --> 00:47:59.400
the City Hall Plaza, unaware
that there is a mob of these

00:47:59.400 --> 00:48:02.400
angry white ethnic
individuals upset about

00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:06.800
busing policies.&nbsp; He's not
an activist as far as busing

00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:08.700
is concerned.&nbsp;
He's not one of the,

00:48:08.700 --> 00:48:11.400
the people on the front
lines calling for change,

00:48:13.467 --> 00:48:17.000
but he is black.&nbsp; And that's
all that mattered to the

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:21.400
person who approached him
and expressed his idea about

00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:25.800
citizenship
upon, or rather in,

00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:31.467
Landsmark.&nbsp; Taking
the American flag,

00:48:31.467 --> 00:48:34.700
with a fixed point, and
goring Landsmark.&nbsp; He

00:48:34.700 --> 00:48:41.300
survives.&nbsp; He survives.&nbsp; But
if you're thinking that the

00:48:41.300 --> 00:48:45.167
politics of
citizenship, and belonging,

00:48:45.167 --> 00:48:46.600
and of racial
symbolism--wrapped up in

00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:48.400
this case in just a black
man walking out of City

00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:51.300
Hall--if you think those
were politics of a different

00:48:51.300 --> 00:48:54.800
era, going back prior to
the sixties and fifties and

00:48:54.800 --> 00:48:57.767
earlier--this is 1970s--and
if you think it's only

00:48:57.767 --> 00:49:01.367
politics of the 1970s, I
think in the last lecture

00:49:01.367 --> 00:49:04.600
we'll see that it's a
problem very much with us in

00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:06.800
our "post-racial"
age.&nbsp; Thank you very much.

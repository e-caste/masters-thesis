00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:02.233
J. MICHAEL MCBRIDE: OK. 

00:00:02.233 --> 00:00:06.233
So we've been talking about
alkenes and their 

00:00:06.233 --> 00:00:07.800
polymerization. 

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.000
Now, we will go on to the
triple-bond analogs, the 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.267
acetylenes, for just a little
bit, and then on to conjugated 

00:00:14.267 --> 00:00:17.667
systems, starting with allylic
intermediates, and then 

00:00:17.667 --> 00:00:21.600
dienes, and then, in general,
about linear and cyclic 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.633
conjugation and aromaticity. 

00:00:25.633 --> 00:00:29.733
So, we can generalize from what
we know about alkenes to 

00:00:29.733 --> 00:00:33.133
acetylenes--that we have the
same kinds of reactions, 

00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:37.000
additions of HBr, additions the
water, addition of H2. 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.233
But all these have a little bit
of a different twist. HBr, 

00:00:41.233 --> 00:00:43.400
we already mentioned this but
I'll go over it again, 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.400
stepwise addition, but
Markovnikov. The addition of 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.433
water, we see the possibility of
keto-enol tautomersim and 

00:00:52.433 --> 00:00:56.667
regioselection, as in alkenes. 

00:00:56.667 --> 00:00:58.500
And then in H2, there's a
question 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.833
of a stepwise addition-- 

00:01:00.833 --> 00:01:03.833
one double bond and then the
other-- one multiple bond and 

00:01:03.833 --> 00:01:04.900
then the other-- 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.533
and the question of
stereoselection. 

00:01:07.533 --> 00:01:11.000
Finally, some stuff about
acidity and based- catalyzed 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.033
isomerization of acetylenes
which you'll see are much more 

00:01:15.033 --> 00:01:18.400
acidic than alkenes are. 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.800
First, we talked about this
already but just to go over 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.900
it quickly once again, it's
possible to add HBr to a 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.700
triple bond like 1-hexene, and
you can use a catalyst that 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.333
helps makes the HBr more acidic,
and you can get a 

00:01:32.333 --> 00:01:34.200
single addition to give a
hexene-- 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.533
2-bromo-1-hexene-- 

00:01:36.533 --> 00:01:39.900
and you often use an inhibitor
so you don't get free-radical 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.633
addition of HBr. 

00:01:42.633 --> 00:01:45.900
Now we mentioned before it was
100 to 1000 times slower 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.700
than the comparable ionic
addition to the alkene, and the

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.567
reason is the vinyl cation is
not so great an intermediate. 

00:01:53.567 --> 00:01:56.200
And you can see that already in
gas-phase 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.200
ionization of the chlorides. 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.100
The one that gives the ethyl
cation requires only 193 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.533
kilocalories per mole to ionize
the chloride. 

00:02:06.533 --> 00:02:11.400
But the vinyl compound, to make
the vinyl cation, 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.600
requires another 32 kilocalories
per mole. 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.933
It's hard to make the vinyl
cation. 

00:02:16.933 --> 00:02:19.433
So that is, of course, what you
make when you add the 

00:02:19.433 --> 00:02:23.767
proton to the hexyne. 

00:02:23.767 --> 00:02:27.533
It's possible to isolate that in
40% yield which seems 

00:02:27.533 --> 00:02:31.467
funny, as we mentioned before,
because if it's not very 

00:02:31.467 --> 00:02:35.500
reactive, wouldn't the hexene
you make be even more reactive,

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.167
so that it would be impossible
to isolate something that was 

00:02:38.167 --> 00:02:40.400
part way along. 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.333
So, you can go further to
2,2-dibromohexane. 

00:02:44.933 --> 00:02:48.800
Obviously it's slower, and it
gives a second Markovnikov 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.833
addition, which if the bromo
substituent slows the addition 

00:02:53.833 --> 00:02:57.300
to an alkene, in order to make
it slower than the initial 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:02.933
addition to the already slow
alkyne, why is the orientation 

00:03:02.933 --> 00:03:03.900
Markovnikov? 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.433
And we saw the resolution to
that riddle a few lectures ago,

00:03:07.433 --> 00:03:10.667
that the halogens do two things,
they withdraw 

00:03:10.667 --> 00:03:13.933
electrons through the sigma bond
and, therefore, make it 

00:03:13.933 --> 00:03:15.700
harder to form the cation. 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.467
But if you form the cation make
it next to the halogen so 

00:03:19.467 --> 00:03:23.500
at least you can profit from
stabilizing the unshared pair 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:24.833
on the halogen. 

00:03:24.833 --> 00:03:27.000
OK, we saw that before. 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.467
Now, hydration and hydrogenation
of alkynes. 

00:03:31.467 --> 00:03:34.533
First hydration, we can do the
same kind of thing we did 

00:03:34.533 --> 00:03:37.467
before, the alkoxymercuration,
which you 

00:03:37.467 --> 00:03:41.200
might remember forms an
unsymmetrical bridged ion, 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:46.867
then water can open it up, and
you get the addition of 

00:03:46.867 --> 00:03:48.400
mercury and OH, 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.133
hydroxymercuration. 

00:03:51.133 --> 00:03:54.067
Now remember what we did before
when this was an alkene 

00:03:54.067 --> 00:03:57.733
to begin with, and we had a
single bond in the product? 

00:03:57.733 --> 00:03:59.533
Nobody wants the mercury
compound. 

00:04:00.833 --> 00:04:02.100
Why did people make it? 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.467
The next step was reduction,
remove the mercury, and 

00:04:08.467 --> 00:04:11.133
replace it with H, so that what
you added 

00:04:11.133 --> 00:04:12.967
was effectively water. 

00:04:12.967 --> 00:04:13.500
Right? 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.933
So, they used sodium borohydride
to do that. 

00:04:16.933 --> 00:04:20.500
However, it doesn't wait around
for you to do that 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.633
under these conditions, because
you have acid there. 

00:04:24.633 --> 00:04:27.700
And with the double bond it's
possible for the 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.733
acid to add to it. 

00:04:30.733 --> 00:04:31.667
Now. 

00:04:31.667 --> 00:04:33.033
so you get that cation. 

00:04:33.033 --> 00:04:34.267
What's good about that cation? 

00:04:37.133 --> 00:04:41.300
Why is that easier to form than
it would have been if it 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:42.567
had just been a regular alkene?

00:04:47.767 --> 00:04:48.233
Elisa? 

00:04:48.233 --> 00:04:49.200
STUDENT: There's the O there. 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.533
PROFESSOR: What does the O have
to do with it? 

00:04:51.533 --> 00:04:54.000
STUDENT: It's able to protonate
it and form the double bond. 

00:04:56.867 --> 00:04:58.500
PROFESSOR: No. 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.900
Well, a double bond gets formed
ultimately. 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.433
But, what's good about the
cation when you have the 

00:05:03.433 --> 00:05:05.933
oxygen next door? 

00:05:05.933 --> 00:05:07.500
Brandon, what do you say? 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:08.333
STUDENT: The p-orbitals? 

00:05:08.333 --> 00:05:11.500
PROFESSOR: Yes, it has unshared
electrons in the p 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.933
-orbitals, that could be
stabilize by the vacant p 

00:05:13.933 --> 00:05:14.833
-orbital next door. 

00:05:14.833 --> 00:05:17.333
So there's a resonance structure
that makes it 

00:05:17.333 --> 00:05:18.633
unusually stable. 

00:05:18.633 --> 00:05:20.467
A HOMO-LUMO interaction. 

00:05:20.467 --> 00:05:23.100
But, what leaves then is the
mercury plus. 

00:05:27.467 --> 00:05:31.700
So, you get this compound, which
is an enol. 

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:35.400
Notice that it was formed with
Markovnikov orientation, as it 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:39.167
would have been the case if it
had started with an alkene. 

00:05:39.167 --> 00:05:45.933
But enols can undergo this same
acid-catalyzed reaction 

00:05:45.933 --> 00:05:50.467
to get that cation which is
stable as we can see in that 

00:05:50.467 --> 00:05:51.733
resonance structure, 

00:05:51.733 --> 00:05:53.000
And what could that do? 

00:05:55.967 --> 00:05:58.767
Lose a proton. 

00:05:58.767 --> 00:06:00.500
So it gives a ketone. 

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:05.767
This got traditionally the name
keto-enol tautomerism. 

00:06:05.767 --> 00:06:08.867
"Tauto" means equivalent to,
right? 

00:06:08.867 --> 00:06:12.600
So the idea was that the ketone
and enol interconverted 

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:15.100
so easily that it was impossible
to 

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:18.133
isolate one or the other. 

00:06:18.133 --> 00:06:22.100
So that's a really easy allylic
rearrangement from one 

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:26.400
end of from one allylic position
to the other. 

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:30.500
And we talked about the
keto-enol equilibrium last 

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:32.767
semester when we were talking
about bond strengths. 

00:06:32.767 --> 00:06:35.100
Just to remind you this is where
we went through it, 

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:39.233
added up the bonds, and showed
that the ketone is much more 

00:06:39.233 --> 00:06:40.467
stable than that enol. 

00:06:40.467 --> 00:06:44.267
I'll just flip through that so
when you're reviewing it you 

00:06:44.267 --> 00:06:45.933
can look at it there. 

00:06:45.933 --> 00:06:47.200
So it goes to the ketone. 

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:53.900
So the product from hydration of
an alkyne is a ketone. 

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:57.633
The alkoxymercuration of an
alkyne-- it doesn't wait 

00:06:57.633 --> 00:07:00.833
around to do the sodium
borohydride reduction. 

00:07:00.833 --> 00:07:03.267
Now, remember, you could do the
other thing in an alkene, 

00:07:03.267 --> 00:07:04.333
add in the other 

00:07:04.333 --> 00:07:06.967
regiochemistry by using a
borane. 

00:07:06.967 --> 00:07:12.267
For acetylenes, you use a
special borane. 

00:07:12.267 --> 00:07:16.367
You get a vinyl borane as the
product, and it won't add a 

00:07:16.367 --> 00:07:20.900
second time if you have those R'
groups sufficiently 

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:24.767
hindered, so that it blocks
access. 

00:07:24.767 --> 00:07:27.300
A way you can do that is with a
compound called 

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:32.500
disiamylborane, which is made
with BH3 and that alkene. And 

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:35.733
so you might think about what
the R groups are, 

00:07:35.733 --> 00:07:38.600
the R' groups, that you put on
there to make that hindered 

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:41.500
one with a single H that then
adds only once. 

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:44.300
So you got that vinyl borane and
do you remember what you 

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:48.600
did with boranes when we added
to a double bond? 

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:49.600
What was the next thing? 

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:51.367
Hydroboration and then what? 

00:07:54.333 --> 00:07:58.000
Incidentally, this reminds me
that a week from today we have 

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.400
another exam. 

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:03.833
It'll cover today's and
Wednesday's lectures. 

00:08:03.833 --> 00:08:06.300
I'll give a review session
Wednesday evening. 

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:13.967
I'll tell you, it will probably
be 8:00 to 10:00. 

00:08:13.967 --> 00:08:16.367
So, you have a week to learn
this stuff. 

00:08:16.367 --> 00:08:18.400
That's good news. 

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:21.900
Anyhow, it was hydroboration and
oxidation 

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:22.833
was the next thing. 

00:08:22.833 --> 00:08:27.500
Remember you treat it with
hydrogen peroxide and alkoxide 

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:30.767
to make the borane into an
alcohol. 

00:08:30.767 --> 00:08:31.700
Right? 

00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:36.767
And then, in this case, we have
an enol as above. 

00:08:36.767 --> 00:08:40.800
So, that'll isomerize to a
carbonyl compound. 

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:43.600
But notice it was
anti-Markovnikov. The addition 

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:46.333
above was Markovnikov: the
oxygen went to the more 

00:08:46.333 --> 00:08:47.967
substituted center. 

00:08:47.967 --> 00:08:51.933
This one, the trick you use when
you do borane the O goes 

00:08:51.933 --> 00:08:54.100
to the less substituted center.

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:57.333
So in that case, you get an
aldehyde. 

00:08:57.333 --> 00:09:02.300
So, the H2 on one carbon and the
O on the other, add in one 

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:05.167
sense here and in the opposite
sense here. 

00:09:05.167 --> 00:09:07.700
So that's nice because if you're
a synthetic chemist 

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:11.233
that gives you the control of
which product you want to get. 

00:09:11.233 --> 00:09:14.967
You can use one method to get
the Markovnikov ketone and the 

00:09:14.967 --> 00:09:18.233
other to get the
anti-Markovnikov aldehyde. 

00:09:18.233 --> 00:09:22.833
So this is hydration with either
regiospecificity. 

00:09:22.833 --> 00:09:27.533
But, also, we could talk about
hydrogenation, adding H2, and 

00:09:27.533 --> 00:09:30.633
here it's a question of
stereospecificity. 

00:09:30.633 --> 00:09:34.200
Up at the top there, if we take
an alkyne and reduce it 

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:38.333
with H2 and a catalyst, as we
talked about with an alkene, 

00:09:38.333 --> 00:09:42.533
you can get first this alkene. 

00:09:42.533 --> 00:09:46.267
You use a special catalyst, this
was developed by a guy 

00:09:46.267 --> 00:09:50.100
named Lindlar and he added lead
to the palladium 

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:53.533
catalyst. Lead is a poison for
catalysts. 

00:09:53.533 --> 00:09:55.667
It makes the catalyst less
active. 

00:09:55.667 --> 00:09:58.033
Why might you want the catalyst

00:09:58.033 --> 00:10:01.000
not to be very active? 

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:01.833
Chris? 

00:10:01.833 --> 00:10:02.833
STUDENT: So it doesn't go all
the way. 

00:10:02.833 --> 00:10:04.333
PROFESSOR: So it doesn't go all
the way. 

00:10:04.333 --> 00:10:07.100
It'll do the acetylene, but it
won't do the alkene. 

00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:08.800
So you can stop and get it
there. 

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:10.700
If you use a more reactive
catalyst, you 

00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:13.633
can go all the way. 

00:10:13.633 --> 00:10:16.500
So that deactivates the
palladium and stops at the 

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:17.533
alkene stage. 

00:10:17.533 --> 00:10:20.900
And notice the two hydrogens
came in from the same side. 

00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:22.333
So it's a syn addition. 

00:10:22.333 --> 00:10:27.800
For example, you get a 97% of
that syn addition if the R is 

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:33.467
this (CH2) esther group. 

00:10:33.467 --> 00:10:37.267
Now, on the other hand, if you
use sodium and ammonia, a 

00:10:37.267 --> 00:10:40.700
thing called a dissolving-metal
reduction, you get the 

00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:44.000
opposite stereospecificity. 

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.133
It's an anti addition. 

00:10:47.133 --> 00:10:49.300
Now you might wonder-- 

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:52.367
the syn addition we talked about
before, the same thing 

00:10:52.367 --> 00:10:55.633
in an alkene about how the
palladium comes in and attacks,

00:10:55.633 --> 00:10:58.433
then it gets replaced by one
hydrogen, by another hydrogen, 

00:10:58.433 --> 00:11:02.000
always front-side attack, so
that it comes out to be syn. 

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.600
That one won't surprise you. 

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:06.600
But why does this one give anti?

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:10.333
The key is that it's a
dissolving-metal reduction. 

00:11:10.333 --> 00:11:13.133
Incidentally, in that case, with
n-propyl groups it's an 

00:11:13.133 --> 00:11:16.267
80% to 90% yield of that anti
addition and I 

00:11:16.267 --> 00:11:19.000
think none of the syn. 

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.033
So it's a dissolving- metal
reduction. 

00:11:21.033 --> 00:11:24.733
So sodium actually dissolves in
ammonia to give 

00:11:24.733 --> 00:11:27.233
electrons and Na+. 

00:11:27.233 --> 00:11:29.000
So it's a very interesting ion
pair. 

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.033
It is an electron and a sodium
ion. 

00:11:32.033 --> 00:11:35.733
Of course, the electron is
solvated by ammonias is around 

00:11:35.733 --> 00:11:38.667
and about it, and it looks blue,
the 

00:11:38.667 --> 00:11:42.367
solutions of electrons. 

00:11:42.367 --> 00:11:45.633
Now if you're have a acetylene
an electron will add to it. 

00:11:45.633 --> 00:11:49.100
What orbital will it go into? 

00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:52.033
What's the LUMO all going to be?

00:11:52.033 --> 00:11:53.400
Yigit, what do you say? 

00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:55.267
STUDENT: The CC pi-star? 

00:11:55.267 --> 00:11:57.567
PROFESSOR: Yeah, pi-star. 

00:11:57.567 --> 00:11:58.967
So notice it puts in-- 

00:11:58.967 --> 00:12:02.233
there is already a pair of
electrons in that 

00:12:02.233 --> 00:12:04.033
corresponding pi orbital. 

00:12:04.033 --> 00:12:06.100
So now you have three electrons

00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:07.967
among those two p-orbitals. 

00:12:07.967 --> 00:12:10.900
So, you can write it as one
being an anion with two 

00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:13.200
electrons, and the other being a
radical 

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:15.267
was the third electron. 

00:12:15.267 --> 00:12:18.000
So, we have an anion radical as
an intermediate. 

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.367
That, of course, is a very
strong base the carbon anion. 

00:12:21.367 --> 00:12:26.200
So it can react with the ammonia
and pull off a proton. 

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:30.267
So, we've added an electron and
a proton. That's the 

00:12:30.267 --> 00:12:33.167
equivalent of adding a hydrogen
atom, although, it's 

00:12:33.167 --> 00:12:35.600
done is two stages. 

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:39.667
So, we get this vinyl radical,
which is bent. 

00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:46.967
They're sp2 hybridized at that
functional carbon. 

00:12:46.967 --> 00:12:51.000
But they invert easily in the
case of a radical. 

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.633
So it goes back and forth
between the R being on the 

00:12:54.633 --> 00:12:57.367
same side and the opposite side.

00:12:57.367 --> 00:12:59.633
Now which one do you think is
favored. 

00:12:59.633 --> 00:13:02.600
Obviously, the one with the R
groups on the opposite side. 

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:05.300
So with equilibrium that's the
one you have. 

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:09.100
And now a second electron comes
along and goes into that 

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:10.900
singly-occupied orbital. 

00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:13.600
So now you're going to have a
pair of electrons there. 

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:16.067
We will write the minus charge
in that "sp 

00:13:16.067 --> 00:13:18.000
squared hybridized orbital. 

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.133
But, now it's harder to invert.

00:13:20.133 --> 00:13:25.333
Remember XH3, how if you added
more electrons it ceased to be 

00:13:25.333 --> 00:13:26.433
planar and became pyramidal. 

00:13:26.433 --> 00:13:28.233
The same idea here. 

00:13:28.233 --> 00:13:30.400
So now it doesn't flip back and
forth rapidly. 

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:39.667
So, a second proton can be taken
away from the ammonia, 

00:13:39.667 --> 00:13:42.200
and we get that product, and the
two H's as 

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:43.633
are on opposite sides. 

00:13:43.633 --> 00:13:45.400
It's an anti addition. 

00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:47.800
Why anti? 

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:51.467
It's because that isomerization
of the radicals 

00:13:51.467 --> 00:13:54.567
favored the one with the R's far
apart from one another. 

00:13:54.567 --> 00:13:58.367
Then it got trapped as the anion
in that geometry. 

00:13:58.367 --> 00:14:02.267
And then it went on to give the
anti product, as we 

00:14:02.267 --> 00:14:05.300
gave yields of on the previous
slide. 

00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:09.200
Now, the final special thing
about alkynes that we're going 

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:12.967
to talk about is there acidity
and how that relates to 

00:14:12.967 --> 00:14:15.400
isomerization of alkynes. 

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:20.033
So, we looked before at these
pKa values for carbon, 

00:14:20.033 --> 00:14:22.400
nitrogen, and oxygen. 

00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:26.033
In the order you would expect
them to be. 

00:14:26.033 --> 00:14:29.133
But, then if you have an "sp
squared hybridized carbon or 

00:14:29.133 --> 00:14:32.400
an "sp hybridized carbon, they
get much more acidic. 

00:14:37.267 --> 00:14:39.300
We talked about this before. 

00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:44.333
And in some cases if you have
next door...if you're breaking a

00:14:44.333 --> 00:14:45.600
CH bond and next door  

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:51.767
and there's a double bond, you
can get extra acidity. 

00:14:51.767 --> 00:14:55.033
OK, that stabilization. 

00:14:55.033 --> 00:14:59.067
So anyhow, we've looked at those
pKas and here we can see 

00:14:59.067 --> 00:15:03.233
the energies of these three
isomers of an alkyne. 

00:15:03.233 --> 00:15:06.567
So, you have the alkyne on the
left, the lowest energy is 

00:15:06.567 --> 00:15:10.033
heavily substituted, on the far
right is one that's at the 

00:15:10.033 --> 00:15:15.633
end of the chain, so not having
as many carbon-carbon 

00:15:15.633 --> 00:15:19.167
bonds with the special sp
hybrid, 

00:15:19.167 --> 00:15:20.633
it's not a stable. 

00:15:20.633 --> 00:15:26.133
And in the middle we have the
diene version, the 1,2-diene. 

00:15:26.133 --> 00:15:28.667
So at equilibrium you would
strongly favor 

00:15:28.667 --> 00:15:31.500
the internal acetylene. 

00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:34.300
But how do you establish an
equilibrium among these? 

00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:37.833
You have to move hydrogens
around. 

00:15:37.833 --> 00:15:42.333
So at equilibrium, given those
energies, there's one 0.1% of 

00:15:42.333 --> 00:15:46.900
the 1,2-diene and 0.03% of the
terminal acetylenes. 

00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:49.267
So very little of those. 

00:15:49.267 --> 00:15:53.667
So, we just talked about the
fact that the terminal 

00:15:53.667 --> 00:15:55.233
acetylene could be rather 

00:15:55.233 --> 00:15:58.933
the internal acetylene could be
acidic because of the 

00:15:58.933 --> 00:16:02.767
pi bonds next door making the
anion more stable. 

00:16:02.767 --> 00:16:07.100
So, indeed you could do that, or
you could do this one, 

00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:09.533
that was on the previous slide
as well. 

00:16:09.533 --> 00:16:12.567
Or you could do the terminal
acetylene, which is the easiest

00:16:12.567 --> 00:16:16.300
one to take off to put the
electrons in the low-energy 

00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:18.633
sp hybrid orbital. 

00:16:18.633 --> 00:16:21.933
Now the "pKa over here is 38. 

00:16:21.933 --> 00:16:28.700
So that means that the "Ka is
10^-38 or the energy involved 

00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:34.033
in getting up there's about 51
kilocalories per mole. 

00:16:34.033 --> 00:16:38.100
Over on the right it's 33
kilocalories per mole. 

00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:40.733
Still way up hill. 

00:16:40.733 --> 00:16:44.867
So those energies are quite far
above the... that's what we 

00:16:44.867 --> 00:16:46.767
know from the pKa's. 

00:16:46.767 --> 00:16:49.800
So if we wanted to take off a
proton, then put it back on, 

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:52.900
and take off a different one,
put it back on and finally go 

00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:57.433
to the final anion, we would
have to go way up in energy. 

00:16:57.433 --> 00:17:00.967
If you have to go up 51
kilocalories per mole that's 

00:17:00.967 --> 00:17:02.933
not a very fast process. 

00:17:02.933 --> 00:17:06.600
The rate constant for that would
be 10^13 per second 

00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:12.333
times 10^-38 or the halftime
would be about 10^17 years 

00:17:12.333 --> 00:17:15.867
which is about 10^4 times the
time that's elapsed 

00:17:15.867 --> 00:17:17.000
since the big bang. 

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.033
So don't wait around for that
one to happen. 

00:17:21.033 --> 00:17:23.600
Ok? So, obviously, you're not
going to be able to isomerize 

00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:26.967
that way by just let it ionize
off a proton. 

00:17:26.967 --> 00:17:33.000
But, if you put hydroxide in it
reacts with the proton to 

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:37.300
make water and that's worth 21
kilocalories per mole. 

00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:44.933
Remember, the pKa is 16, 4/3 of
16 is 21. 

00:17:44.933 --> 00:17:46.667
So, 21 kilocalories per mole. 

00:17:46.667 --> 00:17:51.000
That makes it 21 kilocalories
easier to make the anion, 

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.033
because you're not making
proton, you're making water. 

00:17:55.033 --> 00:17:56.533
So that's going to lower these.

00:17:56.533 --> 00:18:01.000
Is that going to do the trick to
be able to isomerize? 

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:05.933
Well, now the halftime would be
about 30 years at room 

00:18:05.933 --> 00:18:08.200
temperature. 

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:12.300
But, if you warmed it to 150K it
would be about two minutes. 

00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:15.467
So, if you heat it up you could
make the 

00:18:15.467 --> 00:18:17.700
isomerization occur. 

00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:20.667
Then no matter which of these
you start with it's going to 

00:18:20.667 --> 00:18:23.800
equilibrate, and this is the
lowest energy form, and that's 

00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:27.233
going to be everything, except
there's going to be 0.1 % here 

00:18:27.233 --> 00:18:30.667
and 0.03% there. 

00:18:30.667 --> 00:18:32.433
So no matter which of these you
start with you're 

00:18:32.433 --> 00:18:34.267
going to get that. 

00:18:34.267 --> 00:18:39.800
However, suppose you use a
really strong base like amide. 

00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:43.733
So now that favors loss of a
proton. 

00:18:43.733 --> 00:18:48.233
That is it'll take the proton by
45 kilocalories per mole. 

00:18:48.233 --> 00:18:50.800
So now we're going to lower the
those ions even 

00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:52.533
further, like that. 

00:18:52.533 --> 00:18:55.133
And notice what happens on the
far right. 

00:18:55.133 --> 00:18:57.333
It goes all the way down there.

00:18:57.333 --> 00:19:02.433
That's now the lowest energy
form, if you have NH2-. 

00:19:02.433 --> 00:19:05.433
So, instead of having it be all
here, which is what you're 

00:19:05.433 --> 00:19:08.167
going to have in any equilibrium
among the neutral 

00:19:08.167 --> 00:19:13.633
forms, this is going to be the
lowest-energy form. 

00:19:13.633 --> 00:19:17.933
So everything will be over
there, 7.2 kilocalories down, 

00:19:17.933 --> 00:19:20.267
which means that at equilibrium
you will have only 

00:19:20.267 --> 00:19:23.767
0.001% of this stuff, which was
always the 

00:19:23.767 --> 00:19:25.633
favored stuff before. 

00:19:25.633 --> 00:19:28.300
So everything is now over here.

00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:34.167
So the trick is now you
neutralize it very rapidly. 

00:19:34.167 --> 00:19:37.133
So the trick to obtain a
terminal acetylene, remember 

00:19:37.133 --> 00:19:41.567
that anion is the one that has
the anion on the last carbon, 

00:19:41.567 --> 00:19:44.300
that's why it's such a stable
anion because it's sp 

00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:45.567
hybridized. 

00:19:45.567 --> 00:19:50.367
So, you a equlibrate with an
amide base in an amine solvent 

00:19:50.367 --> 00:19:52.733
to form the terminal anion. 

00:19:52.733 --> 00:19:56.167
Then you quench it by adding
water to donate a proton to 

00:19:56.167 --> 00:19:59.633
the terminal anion and also to
the RNH. 

00:19:59.633 --> 00:20:03.200
So you have only hydroxide now,
which is too weak to 

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:04.800
allow equilibration. 

00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:07.933
Or if you want to, you could
just add acid so that you 

00:20:07.933 --> 00:20:09.567
don't even have OH there,
although, 

00:20:09.567 --> 00:20:11.167
that's gilding the lily. 

00:20:11.167 --> 00:20:13.000
You've already made it by not
having that 

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.200
really strong base. 

00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:17.700
So you stopped equilibrium, you
put the proton on the 

00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:20.767
terminal acetylene, so you can
go from the internal, the more 

00:20:20.767 --> 00:20:22.967
stable one usually, to the
terminal 

00:20:22.967 --> 00:20:26.700
acetylene using the trick. 

00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:30.867
So that's all I wanted to say
about acetylenes. 

00:20:30.867 --> 00:20:34.567
Now we're going on for these
next two lectures, and a 

00:20:34.567 --> 00:20:38.900
little bit probably still beyond
the exam, to talk about 

00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:42.333
conjugation and aromaticity. 

00:20:42.333 --> 00:20:45.533
So conjugated pi systems is what
you're talking about. 

00:20:45.533 --> 00:20:49.633
The name conjugated comes from
an interesting root. 

00:20:49.633 --> 00:20:54.733
Conjugated systems are when you
have pi bonds separated by 

00:20:54.733 --> 00:20:57.900
a single bond. 

00:20:57.900 --> 00:20:59.933
They are called conjugated
because 

00:20:59.933 --> 00:21:01.667
they are yoked together. 

00:21:01.667 --> 00:21:05.733
The word yoke is the same root.

00:21:05.733 --> 00:21:10.133
Yoke comes from jungere from
jugom which is to join. 

00:21:10.133 --> 00:21:11.467
So they're joined together. 

00:21:11.467 --> 00:21:13.433
They don't act independently. 

00:21:13.433 --> 00:21:17.433
And we talked about this already
in the first exam when 

00:21:17.433 --> 00:21:19.367
you memorized functional groups.

00:21:19.367 --> 00:21:23.300
And on the exam I had a thing
that had both the carbonyl and 

00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:25.467
an amine, and they were near one
another. 

00:21:25.467 --> 00:21:27.933
But it's not a carbonyl group
and an amine group. 

00:21:27.933 --> 00:21:29.333
It's an amide group. 

00:21:29.333 --> 00:21:30.967
They are conjugated and they
behave in 

00:21:30.967 --> 00:21:32.467
their own special way. 

00:21:32.467 --> 00:21:36.067
So now we're going to talk about
conjugation. 

00:21:36.067 --> 00:21:41.200
So, conjugation is where the
localized orbital picture, 

00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:44.567
which remember we've talked so
much about pairwise two atoms 

00:21:44.567 --> 00:21:47.533
coming together to give a bond
and an anti-bond or isolated 

00:21:47.533 --> 00:21:48.900
the atomic orbitals. 

00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:52.600
That was our intermediate
between hydrogen-like atomic 

00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:54.400
orbitals, which we really
understood-- 

00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:57.467
we had a table that we could
drawn them out-- and the 

00:21:57.467 --> 00:21:59.933
computer MOs, which looked very
complicated. 

00:21:59.933 --> 00:22:04.233
But in between were these
pairwise things. 

00:22:04.233 --> 00:22:07.300
But sometimes we have to think
more deeply when these things 

00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:08.000
are conjugated. 

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.633
They don't behave that way. 

00:22:10.633 --> 00:22:13.700
So when does conjugation make a
difference? 

00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:16.900
First we're going to look at
experimental evidence, and 

00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:19.300
then we're going to go into the
theory. 

00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:23.800
So a classic example is allylic
stabilization. 

00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:27.033
Allyl comes from the word-- the
same as aioli-- 

00:22:27.033 --> 00:22:29.767
or [? el ?] in French meeting
garlic. 

00:22:29.767 --> 00:22:34.767
There's a sulfide in garlic that
has a double 

00:22:34.767 --> 00:22:37.000
bond, that is carbon 

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:38.867
double bond, single bond, and
then a 

00:22:38.867 --> 00:22:40.467
functional group, a sulfide. 

00:22:40.467 --> 00:22:42.267
So that's an allylic sulfide-- 

00:22:42.267 --> 00:22:43.600
came from garlic. 

00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:47.667
So, allyl is these three carbons
in a row, double bond, 

00:22:47.667 --> 00:22:49.600
single bond. 

00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:52.067
So, you can get special
stabilization when you have 

00:22:52.067 --> 00:22:53.433
functional groups involved-- 

00:22:53.433 --> 00:22:55.333
when you have rather
intermediates involved there,

00:22:55.333 --> 00:22:57.200
like the cation intermediate.

00:22:57.200 --> 00:23:02.000
So the energy for pulling off a
chloride for primary and 

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.700
secondary are these values in
the gas phase. 

00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:07.367
Of course, very hard to separate
the ions, but if it's 

00:23:07.367 --> 00:23:10.933
allylic it's as good as being
secondary. 

00:23:10.933 --> 00:23:14.733
So allylic is very good. 

00:23:14.733 --> 00:23:18.300
Or if you look at anions. Look
at the "pKa of the OH. 

00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:21.600
Here it is 16 we know, if you
have a double bond here it 

00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:25.167
falls by six orders of
magnitude. 

00:23:25.167 --> 00:23:27.767
And in the case where it's an
oxygen here it falls by 

00:23:27.767 --> 00:23:29.400
another five orders of
magnitude. 

00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:32.200
You actually call it an acid. 

00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:35.800
So the anions get much more
stable when they're allylic by 

00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:41.833
about 8 kilocalories per mole,
in the case of the enol. 

00:23:41.833 --> 00:23:43.933
Or free radicals. 

00:23:43.933 --> 00:23:46.167
If you look at the bond
dissociation energy of a 

00:23:46.167 --> 00:23:50.367
normal CH bond, 101, but if you
make a double bond next door 

00:23:50.367 --> 00:23:52.367
so that this is allylic it's 89.

00:23:52.367 --> 00:23:56.300
It is stabilized by about 13
kilocalories per mole. 

00:23:56.300 --> 00:24:00.167
So there's stabilization of
these reactive intermediates 

00:24:00.167 --> 00:24:03.133
when there allylic. 

00:24:03.133 --> 00:24:05.667
Now let's look at some more
detail about some of these 

00:24:05.667 --> 00:24:07.467
like the cation intermediate. 

00:24:07.467 --> 00:24:10.333
The addition of HX to butadiene.

00:24:10.333 --> 00:24:14.600
We talked about HX, halogen
acids adding to 

00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:15.600
single double bonds. 

00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:18.533
How about adding into two double
bonds. 

00:24:18.533 --> 00:24:23.633
So at -78 degrees, you can add
HBr to butadiene, and you 

00:24:23.633 --> 00:24:26.867
could imagine the H+ going on
one of the internal carbons to 

00:24:26.867 --> 00:24:30.000
generate that cation or it could
go on the terminal 

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.667
carbon, the other
regiochemistry, and generate 

00:24:32.667 --> 00:24:34.633
that cation. 

00:24:34.633 --> 00:24:38.000
Which of those do you think is
more likely to get? 

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.533
Which one would you prefer, if
you were the proton? 

00:24:40.533 --> 00:24:41.000
Ayesha? 

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:42.533
STUDENT: The one that's down. 

00:24:42.533 --> 00:24:43.767
PROFESSOR: The lower one. 

00:24:43.767 --> 00:24:45.000
Why? 

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:45.833
STUDENT: It's a secondary
cation. 

00:24:45.833 --> 00:24:48.367
PROFESSOR: First, it is
secondary. 

00:24:48.367 --> 00:24:50.100
And it's also allylic 

00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:54.233
right, which the first one
isn't, because from this carbon

00:24:54.233 --> 00:24:58.267
to the double bond there's an
intervening saturated carbon. 

00:24:58.267 --> 00:25:02.700
It's not two double bonds or two
sets of p orbitals 

00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:04.600
separated by a single bond. 

00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:06.433
There's no overlap between this
p 

00:25:06.433 --> 00:25:08.800
orbital and that "p orbital. 

00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:13.033
So, the second one is, of
course, also that, because 

00:25:13.033 --> 00:25:14.733
those are resonance structures.

00:25:14.733 --> 00:25:17.767
But as Ayesha tells us, the top
one doesn't look so good. 

00:25:17.767 --> 00:25:18.967
So we're going to get one of
those. 

00:25:18.967 --> 00:25:23.667
But then in a second step we add
bromide. 

00:25:23.667 --> 00:25:26.900
If we do that at -78 degrees, of
course, we generated the 

00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:30.967
bromide when we attacked the
proton. 

00:25:30.967 --> 00:25:35.300
So, we could imagine getting
those two forms by attacking 

00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:39.800
this intermediate, which is
denoted by two resonance 

00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:41.633
structures. 

00:25:41.633 --> 00:25:50.500
Now, in fact, you get those in
the ratio of 80% to 20%. 

00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:51.433
Does that surprise you? 

00:25:51.433 --> 00:25:54.933
What would you expect for the
ratio of these two? 

00:25:54.933 --> 00:25:56.400
Here you have a terminal double
bond. 

00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:58.067
Here you have an internal bond.

00:25:58.067 --> 00:25:59.300
Which one is more stable? 

00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:04.300
Do you like to have double bonds
more substituted or less 

00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:05.467
substituted? 

00:26:05.467 --> 00:26:06.700
Arvind, do you remember? 

00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:08.100
STUDENT: More substituted. 

00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:08.567
PROFESSOR: More substituted. 

00:26:08.567 --> 00:26:10.467
So, this is backwards. 

00:26:10.467 --> 00:26:13.100
It's 4 to 1 in the wrong
direction. 

00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:17.000
Now that means if you allow it
to equilibrate, it'll go the 

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:20.000
way Arvind wants it to. 

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.767
But, the initial product formed
at really low 

00:26:22.767 --> 00:26:25.100
temperature, at dry ice
temperature, is backwards. 

00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:29.467
You can cause-- 

00:26:29.467 --> 00:26:34.867
this in fact, can ionize to go
back to the cation and then 

00:26:34.867 --> 00:26:38.100
come back, and that's a route
for equilibration 

00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:39.267
between these two. 

00:26:39.267 --> 00:26:42.100
And you can encourage the
bromide to come off by putting 

00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:44.867
ferric bromide in, if you want
to, it'll go faster. 

00:26:44.867 --> 00:26:47.533
But, at any rate, that's the
equilibrium. 

00:26:47.533 --> 00:26:52.633
So this is called kinetic versus
thermodynamic control. 

00:26:52.633 --> 00:26:55.367
So thermodynamic is equilibrium.

00:26:55.367 --> 00:26:58.533
But kinetic is what you get
first, and those aren't 

00:26:58.533 --> 00:26:59.633
necessarily the same. 

00:26:59.633 --> 00:27:02.767
It's this case we've seen before
where you start and you 

00:27:02.767 --> 00:27:07.333
go up, a certain rate, and then
down to a product, or you could

00:27:07.333 --> 00:27:09.400
go to a more stable product. 

00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:12.200
Hammond would say, you'd go
faster to the more stable 

00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:14.800
product, but sometimes,
remember, it crosses and it's 

00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:20.167
easier to get to the less stable
product, and that's 

00:27:20.167 --> 00:27:21.133
the example here. 

00:27:21.133 --> 00:27:24.933
It's a kinetic control under
that low temperature. 

00:27:24.933 --> 00:27:30.400
Now why when it's a question of
rate, the first one to be 

00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:34.133
formed, why do you think you
form the top one? 

00:27:34.133 --> 00:27:36.833
Anybody got a theory? 

00:27:36.833 --> 00:27:37.567
Yes. 

00:27:37.567 --> 00:27:38.933
STUDENT: The positive charge. 

00:27:38.933 --> 00:27:41.533
PROFESSOR: What about the
positive charge? 

00:27:41.533 --> 00:27:45.833
STUDENT: The electrons on the
bromine, the bromide ion, are

00:27:45.833 --> 00:27:47.000
attached to the partner. 

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:47.267
PROFESSOR: Right. 

00:27:47.267 --> 00:27:51.233
It looks like this is a
secondary versus primary: 

00:27:51.233 --> 00:27:52.833
more of this, 

00:27:52.833 --> 00:27:54.333
so that's where it attacks. 

00:27:54.333 --> 00:27:56.033
That looks like a good
explanation. 

00:27:56.033 --> 00:27:59.167
And that's what you'll see in
almost all textbooks. 

00:27:59.167 --> 00:28:00.700
So very good, Anurag. 

00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:01.933
You can write a textbook. 

00:28:05.033 --> 00:28:07.300
Let's look at the orbitals that
are involved in this just 

00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:08.900
for fun, quickly. 

00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:12.167
So here's a top view down on the
"four p 

00:28:12.167 --> 00:28:13.533
orbitals to the butadiene, 

00:28:13.533 --> 00:28:15.700
and here's the side view. 

00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:17.967
So here's the HOMO - 1. 

00:28:17.967 --> 00:28:20.067
That's the favorable combination
of 

00:28:20.067 --> 00:28:21.300
those "four p orbitals. 

00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:28.233
And here's the HOMO, that's the
unfavorable combination. 

00:28:28.233 --> 00:28:31.633
It's pi on this side, pi on this
side, but unfavorable 

00:28:31.633 --> 00:28:33.800
between them. 

00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:34.967
That's the HOMO. 

00:28:34.967 --> 00:28:39.267
The LUMO has two nodes among the
four p orbitals. 

00:28:39.267 --> 00:28:44.000
And what do you think the LUMO +
1 looks like? 

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:45.233
It's got three nodes. 

00:28:45.233 --> 00:28:50.500
So you've got no nodes, one
node, two nodes, three nodes for

00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:53.467
combinations among those p
orbitals. 

00:28:53.467 --> 00:28:55.367
Now , the HOMO is the one you
want to 

00:28:55.367 --> 00:29:00.200
attack with the proton. 

00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:01.667
So where should you attack it? 

00:29:01.667 --> 00:29:06.200
Probably, you get the best
overlap around in there. 

00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:10.733
Or you could look at how the
potential on the surface that 

00:29:10.733 --> 00:29:13.867
we talked about to see where the
best place for a proton is 

00:29:13.867 --> 00:29:15.733
and it's in the orange region. 

00:29:15.733 --> 00:29:17.800
So that seems to more or less to
agree. 

00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:18.500
It's about there. 

00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:20.533
So that's where the proton
should attack at 

00:29:20.533 --> 00:29:24.233
the terminal carbon. 

00:29:24.233 --> 00:29:28.233
And then it would give the
propenyl cation. 

00:29:28.233 --> 00:29:29.567
which is shown here. 

00:29:29.567 --> 00:29:32.967
There are three hydrogen on this
carbon here. 

00:29:32.967 --> 00:29:35.833
So that's the best product then.

00:29:35.833 --> 00:29:39.967
Now that's the HOMO - 4, it's a
little bit silly to look at 

00:29:39.967 --> 00:29:44.367
that, but it's actually a CH
bond that is hyperconjugated a 

00:29:44.367 --> 00:29:45.700
little bit with the "p. 

00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:48.900
Now we have three "p orbitals
here, here, here. 

00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:52.133
The one that was here became
part of this CH bond. 

00:29:52.133 --> 00:29:53.433
Now, how about the rest of them?

00:29:56.833 --> 00:30:03.367
Here's the home it's pi, here's
the LUMO one node, and 

00:30:03.367 --> 00:30:08.000
here's the LUMO + 1, two nodes
among those three "p orbitals. 

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:12.200
So that's the propenyl cation. 

00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:15.367
There's the LUMO that you're
going to want to attack, if 

00:30:15.367 --> 00:30:17.800
you're the bromide. 

00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:20.767
So you could attack at either
end, not in the middle. 

00:30:23.633 --> 00:30:29.533
And if you look at the surface
potential, the worst place for 

00:30:29.533 --> 00:30:37.800
a proton is where it's very blue
here. 

00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:40.833
So that would be the best place
for bromide to come. 

00:30:40.833 --> 00:30:42.400
But it's in the plane of the
ring. 

00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:44.267
It's not a place you can form a
bond. 

00:30:49.267 --> 00:30:52.267
If you want to come in from the
top where you can form a 

00:30:52.267 --> 00:30:56.300
new bond, it's a little bit
green in there, and a little 

00:30:56.300 --> 00:30:57.967
bit blue, even, better there. 

00:30:57.967 --> 00:31:03.000
So the blue place +144 would be
the best place to attack, if 

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:04.900
you want to form a bond. 

00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:07.800
That's where bromide would tend
to be in order to attack. 

00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:11.567
So one would think that this is
exactly what Anurag 

00:31:11.567 --> 00:31:14.267
proposed, that it should attack
there. 

00:31:14.267 --> 00:31:16.700
But here's a really interesting
paper that was 

00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:20.700
published in 1979, where what's
being added to is not 

00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:24.233
butadiene, but pentadiene,
another 

00:31:24.233 --> 00:31:25.733
methyl group, on there. 

00:31:25.733 --> 00:31:31.300
So they add DCl which adds to
the end to get the, as one 

00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:36.333
would expect, more substituted
allylic cation. 

00:31:36.333 --> 00:31:38.900
But now there's something
interesting about that. 

00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:41.467
That's symmetrical, except for
the fact that there's a 

00:31:41.467 --> 00:31:44.033
deuterium there. 

00:31:44.033 --> 00:31:47.400
So if a bromide now comes in, or
in this case they use 

00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:52.233
cholride, it could attack either
here or here. 

00:31:52.233 --> 00:31:56.700
If it attacks here, you get the
1,2-addition, D and Cl. 

00:31:56.700 --> 00:32:00.333
If it attacks here, you get
1,4-addition 4, D and Cl. 

00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:08.200
Now, if it had to do with the
kind of thing we talked about 

00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:10.900
before, where's the best place
to put a chloride, where do 

00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:13.033
you got the best overlap, and so
on. 

00:32:13.033 --> 00:32:15.767
That's the same here and here. 

00:32:15.767 --> 00:32:20.033
So it should be 50/50, in this
case because of the 

00:32:20.033 --> 00:32:21.800
intermediate being symmetrical.

00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:24.333
when it was butadiene, and we
didn't have this methyl group 

00:32:24.333 --> 00:32:26.700
and it was unsymmetrical when we
did the analysis of the 

00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:30.100
previous slide, where would be
the best place to attack. 

00:32:30.100 --> 00:32:33.000
But now it's symmetrical, so we
should get 50/50. 

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.333
So here's the product
distribution done in a bunch 

00:32:35.333 --> 00:32:37.633
of different solvents and
different temperatures and 

00:32:37.633 --> 00:32:39.200
just look at a couple of these.

00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:43.333
If you do it at room
temperature, at 25 degrees you 

00:32:43.333 --> 00:32:47.600
get half again as much of this
as you do in this. 

00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:50.467
More chlorides adds here than
here. 

00:32:50.467 --> 00:32:52.967
And if you do it at low
temperature, you get three 

00:32:52.967 --> 00:32:57.467
times as much addition here as
here, even though it's 

00:32:57.467 --> 00:32:59.133
symmetrical . 

00:32:59.133 --> 00:33:03.300
So we've got to find some other
reason why when we do 

00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:08.600
this, the chloride tends to
attack here, rather than here. 

00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:12.500
1,2-addition rather than
1,4-addition. 

00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:16.600
Can anybody guess a reason for
that? 

00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:18.333
Well let's look at the
mechanism. 

00:33:18.333 --> 00:33:22.900
The first thing that happens is
we put a proton on and 

00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:28.000
generate this cation and also
choloride. 

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:29.267
Now, do you have an idea? 

00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:32.600
Ayesha? 

00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:34.300
STUDENT: It's closer. 

00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:35.433
PROFESSOR: It's closer. 

00:33:35.433 --> 00:33:39.700
It has to move farther to get to
1,4 because this backside 

00:33:39.700 --> 00:33:43.467
attack on the hydrogen meant
that the chloride has to be 

00:33:43.467 --> 00:33:45.000
out here someplace-- 

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:49.167
closer to this end than to this
end. 

00:33:49.167 --> 00:33:52.800
So it appears that rapid
collapse of this ion pair that 

00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:56.733
you've made, before the ions
could move independently and 

00:33:56.733 --> 00:34:02.167
establish true symmetry that
competes, so that the collapse 

00:34:02.167 --> 00:34:05.133
competes with the motion that
would make it truly symmetric. 

00:34:05.133 --> 00:34:08.267
So it looks like it might not
have anything to do with where 

00:34:08.267 --> 00:34:11.267
the charge is on the surface or
which resonance 

00:34:11.267 --> 00:34:13.900
structure is better. 

00:34:13.900 --> 00:34:17.333
It's just where the chloride got
formed and that attacks 

00:34:17.333 --> 00:34:20.300
really quickly when the ion pair
collapses. 

00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:22.767
So you at it you could have
written a textbook, but you 

00:34:22.767 --> 00:34:24.000
might not have been right. 

00:34:26.667 --> 00:34:30.933
Now, allylic transition states
also are unusually stable, and 

00:34:30.933 --> 00:34:33.000
we actually mentioned this
before. 

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:36.867
But if you look at an SN1
reaction so your breaking away 

00:34:36.867 --> 00:34:38.800
to get a cation, 

00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:42.600
the relative rates are, if you
take 100 for t-butyl which is 

00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:47.200
very easy to form the t-butyl
cation, the secondary is 10^4 

00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:50.533
times slower, and the primary
just doesn't happen. 

00:34:50.533 --> 00:34:52.567
It's way slower than that. 

00:34:52.567 --> 00:34:57.133
But if it's allylic then it's 5
times faster than secondary, 

00:34:57.133 --> 00:35:00.400
even though you might think it
would be primary. 

00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:03.767
And if it's allylic with a
methyl group on it, to make the

00:35:03.767 --> 00:35:05.900
cation more stable that you're
forming when 

00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:08.267
you break off chloride, 

00:35:08.267 --> 00:35:11.100
it's half as fast as a
tertiary-- 

00:35:11.100 --> 00:35:12.400
t-butyl choloride. 

00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:16.733
If you put two methyl groups
there, it's very much faster, 

00:35:16.733 --> 00:35:21.500
63 times faster than t-butyl. 

00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:25.767
And if you put a methyl group
here, however, on this carbon...

00:35:25.767 --> 00:35:30.000
So we put a methyl group here it
accelerates enormously. 

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.933
If we put two methyl groups
there it really accelerates.

00:35:32.933 --> 00:35:43.167
[brief confusion]

00:35:43.167 --> 00:35:46.833
If we put it on the other end
it's just as good. 

00:35:46.833 --> 00:35:49.567
But, this is what I wanted to
tell you, if you put the methyl

00:35:49.567 --> 00:35:52.633
group in the middle it doesn't
help at all. 

00:35:52.633 --> 00:35:56.067
So the methyl group has to be on
one end or the other of the 

00:35:56.067 --> 00:35:59.567
cation you're going to make when
you lose the chloride, 

00:35:59.567 --> 00:36:01.400
in order to get that
acceleration. 

00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:03.433
If you put in the middle, it
doesn't help. 

00:36:03.433 --> 00:36:06.800
So again, we could look at where
the charge is in the 

00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:09.733
cation, and you have to put the
methyl, to 

00:36:09.733 --> 00:36:15.733
be effective in accelerating the
SN1 reaction-- 

00:36:15.733 --> 00:36:17.900
it has to be where the charge is
going to be. 

00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:22.800
Now, how about SN2? 

00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:27.200
If we take the rate of ethyl
chloride to be 1 reacting with 

00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:31.267
ethoxide it's 37 times faster if
it's allylic. 

00:36:31.267 --> 00:36:34.600
And 97 times faster if you put a
methyl on, 

00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:39.467
and 560 times faster if you put
two methyls on. 

00:36:39.467 --> 00:36:43.967
If you put the methyl in the
middle it doesn't help 

00:36:43.967 --> 00:36:48.467
compared to not having a methyl.

00:36:48.467 --> 00:36:52.033
But if you put the methyl at
this end, remember before when 

00:36:52.033 --> 00:36:55.567
we were doing SN1 forming the
cation, we could put it either 

00:36:55.567 --> 00:36:58.933
at this end or this end and got
the same rate, 

00:36:58.933 --> 00:37:00.300
now it's slower here. 

00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:02.533
Any idea why it should be slower
in this 

00:37:02.533 --> 00:37:03.767
case for the SN2? 

00:37:07.067 --> 00:37:08.900
How about the rate of t-butyl
for SN2? 

00:37:12.267 --> 00:37:13.933
You have t-butyl, three methyls,
and 

00:37:13.933 --> 00:37:15.200
you want to do SN2. 

00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:18.833
It's very hindered. 

00:37:18.833 --> 00:37:21.600
So this hinders the approach
because, remember you're 

00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:26.200
making a pentavalent carbon in
the transition state. 

00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:30.667
So allylic helps, but this time
you're going to get help 

00:37:30.667 --> 00:37:32.833
from the methyl at this end, but
not at this end. 

00:37:35.533 --> 00:37:39.333
So we looked at the allylic
cation, we looked at the 

00:37:39.333 --> 00:37:44.900
transition states involved in
forming the cation and in the 

00:37:44.900 --> 00:37:46.467
SN2 process. 

00:37:46.467 --> 00:37:48.700
Now let's look at the allylic
anion. 

00:37:48.700 --> 00:37:51.433
That's easily done by looking at
the acidity. 

00:37:51.433 --> 00:37:55.133
So we have a pKa of something
like 52, it's hard to measure 

00:37:55.133 --> 00:37:59.833
for that, but if you have it
allylic it's 43. 

00:37:59.833 --> 00:38:04.100
And that's helped by 9 powers of
10 or about 11 

00:38:04.100 --> 00:38:07.267
kilocalories per mole of
stabilization for losing that 

00:38:07.267 --> 00:38:08.900
proton at equilibrium. 

00:38:08.900 --> 00:38:12.100
And if you a phenyl ring there,
it what's called 

00:38:12.100 --> 00:38:15.767
benzylic, and now it's even more
so, about 16 

00:38:15.767 --> 00:38:16.967
kilocalories per mole. 

00:38:16.967 --> 00:38:20.133
So again having these pi things
where they can overlap 

00:38:20.133 --> 00:38:24.167
with the anion that's being
formed is very favorable-- the 

00:38:24.167 --> 00:38:28.733
order of 10 or 15 kilocalories
per mole. 

00:38:28.733 --> 00:38:30.067
How about free radicals? 

00:38:30.067 --> 00:38:32.467
Well here's a very
interesting...

00:38:32.467 --> 00:38:37.067
these figures came out of this
paper by Ziegler where this 

00:38:37.067 --> 00:38:40.233
Ziegler is not the Ziegler who
teaches Chem 220. 

00:38:40.233 --> 00:38:44.067
This is the one who invented
Ziegler-Natta polymerization 

00:38:44.067 --> 00:38:45.300
and became quite wealthy. 

00:38:47.733 --> 00:38:51.333
So in 1942 working in Germany in
the Second World War he 

00:38:51.333 --> 00:38:52.867
was studying this process. 

00:38:52.867 --> 00:38:57.733
He could get a 58% yield of
substitution. 

00:38:57.733 --> 00:39:00.667
This bromination is a
substitution-- pulling off one 

00:39:00.667 --> 00:39:05.467
of these hydrogens and replacing
it by bromide. 

00:39:05.467 --> 00:39:08.167
Now for this purpose, the paper
that describes this, 

00:39:08.167 --> 00:39:11.233
describes this particular
compound which is called 

00:39:11.233 --> 00:39:12.500
N-bromosuccinimide. 

00:39:14.700 --> 00:39:18.933
And in ether solvent in 30
minutes using light-- 

00:39:18.933 --> 00:39:23.133
What is the fact that he was
using light suggest? 

00:39:23.133 --> 00:39:26.300
That it might be a free-radical
chain reaction. 

00:39:26.300 --> 00:39:28.500
He was able to get this 58%
yield. 

00:39:28.500 --> 00:39:32.133
Now where does he get the
N-bromosuccinimide? 

00:39:32.133 --> 00:39:36.233
So that compound is succinimide.

00:39:36.233 --> 00:39:40.133
He reacted it with base to make
the anion. 

00:39:40.133 --> 00:39:42.200
Does it surprise you that that
anion can 

00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:44.033
be formed with hydroxide? 

00:39:44.033 --> 00:39:50.733
Remember, NH has a "pKa of 30 or
something like that. 

00:39:50.733 --> 00:39:56.767
And hydroxide is only 16, the
"pKa of water. 

00:39:56.767 --> 00:39:58.633
How's it able to pull off that
protron? 

00:39:58.633 --> 00:40:02.333
What's good about that anion
that we formed? 

00:40:02.333 --> 00:40:03.833
Megan, do you have any idea. 

00:40:03.833 --> 00:40:07.333
STUDENT: The lone pair is
stabilized 

00:40:07.333 --> 00:40:09.800
by the pi-star orbitals. 

00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:10.133
PROFESSOR: Right. 

00:40:10.133 --> 00:40:14.400
You have two carbonyl pi-stars
to stabilize the high-energy 

00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:16.667
electrons on this nitrogen. 

00:40:16.667 --> 00:40:20.767
So you can make that anion, but
the pKa, incidentially, of 

00:40:20.767 --> 00:40:22.000
that is 9.5. 

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:25.933
It's a very strong acid as NH
bonds go. 

00:40:25.933 --> 00:40:30.367
And that could do an SN2
reaction on Br2 to put bromine 

00:40:30.367 --> 00:40:33.467
on the nitrogen, and make the
bromide and anion together 

00:40:33.467 --> 00:40:36.267
with the sodium ion that came
from hydroxide. 

00:40:36.267 --> 00:40:38.667
So that's how he got NBS. 

00:40:38.667 --> 00:40:41.033
But you can take it apart again,
if instead of 

00:40:41.033 --> 00:40:43.167
using base, use acid. 

00:40:43.167 --> 00:40:47.200
So if you use HBr, you could
protonate this. 

00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:49.400
You could protonate that oxygen
and you could draw a 

00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:52.533
resonance structure here like
that. 

00:40:52.533 --> 00:40:54.733
So it's easy to protonate here.

00:40:54.733 --> 00:40:58.867
But now you can take the bromide
and do an SN2 

00:40:58.867 --> 00:41:01.933
reaction on the Br. 

00:41:01.933 --> 00:41:08.567
So you generate this, now
neutral, which is an enol that 

00:41:08.567 --> 00:41:11.333
easily isomerizes back to the
starting material. 

00:41:11.333 --> 00:41:15.500
So in base you could make this
with bromine, and if you add 

00:41:15.500 --> 00:41:18.233
HBr, you come back. 

00:41:18.233 --> 00:41:22.733
And of course get Br2 that was
what was formed here. 

00:41:22.733 --> 00:41:26.600
So you can get the Br2 back
again, if you want to, from NBS.

00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:29.067
Now back to the reaction. 

00:41:29.067 --> 00:41:32.967
We can imagine doing a reaction
of Br2 

00:41:32.967 --> 00:41:34.867
with a double bond. 

00:41:34.867 --> 00:41:38.000
What reaction have we talked
about, Br2 plus a double bond? 

00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:46.833
It's the addition, electrophilic
addition to a double bond. 

00:41:46.833 --> 00:41:48.700
We talked about this a good
deal. 

00:41:48.700 --> 00:41:53.233
No doubt it will be covered on
the exam next Monday. 

00:41:53.233 --> 00:41:56.667
You do this at room temperature
in the dark. 

00:41:56.667 --> 00:41:59.533
You get the bromonium ion first.
Remember, how we talked 

00:41:59.533 --> 00:42:04.300
about that and then you get anti
addition. 

00:42:04.300 --> 00:42:06.833
Now, but suppose you want to do
substitution. 

00:42:06.833 --> 00:42:08.333
That's what Ziegler did. 

00:42:08.333 --> 00:42:12.033
He didn't add bromine to the
double bond, he replaced an 

00:42:12.033 --> 00:42:14.267
allylic hydrogen with bromine. 

00:42:14.267 --> 00:42:16.833
So those substitutions are
typically free-radicals 

00:42:16.833 --> 00:42:18.033
substitutions. 

00:42:18.033 --> 00:42:20.733
So you could have this same
compound, but I show the 

00:42:20.733 --> 00:42:24.700
hydrogens, because if you have
ways to get a free radical, 

00:42:24.700 --> 00:42:28.900
like a bromine atom, it can pull
off, get HBr, add this-- 

00:42:28.900 --> 00:42:32.833
but remember, we use bromine in
here, not chlorine, because 

00:42:32.833 --> 00:42:34.867
it's slow and selective. 

00:42:34.867 --> 00:42:39.833
So if you use chlorine, it takes
not only this hydrogen 

00:42:39.833 --> 00:42:42.533
but also this hydrogen almost as
rapidly: 

00:42:42.533 --> 00:42:44.700
it's not selective. But bromine
is selective: 

00:42:44.700 --> 00:42:46.367
it's uphill. 

00:42:46.367 --> 00:42:50.267
Then you could react it with Br2
and replace where the 

00:42:50.267 --> 00:42:51.700
hydrogen is with bromine. 

00:42:51.700 --> 00:42:53.867
So you've done allylic
bromination. 

00:42:53.867 --> 00:43:00.267
And, of course, this allylic
intermediate was 

00:43:00.267 --> 00:43:01.200
resonant in this form. 

00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:04.000
You could have put the bromine
either here or here. 

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:08.500
So you also get that, which is
the same material in the case 

00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:10.767
shown, but if you had a
substituent, it would be in a 

00:43:10.767 --> 00:43:12.400
different position. 

00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:15.167
If you had something on the ring
substituted here it would 

00:43:15.167 --> 00:43:17.700
be a different compound. 

00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:19.167
And it also gives a bromine
atom. 

00:43:19.167 --> 00:43:22.300
Why is that relevant? 

00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:25.500
What happens to the bromine
atom? 

00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:26.333
Matt? 

00:43:26.333 --> 00:43:29.000
STUDENT: It gets reused in the
free-radical chain. 

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:30.400
PROFESSOR: Right, it goes back
to the start. 

00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:33.433
It is a chain reaction. 

00:43:33.433 --> 00:43:36.200
So how do you control which
you're going to get? 

00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:40.167
Are you going to get bromine
addition or allylic 

00:43:40.167 --> 00:43:42.933
substitution? 

00:43:42.933 --> 00:43:45.567
Can you think of any way of
controlling which of these. 

00:43:45.567 --> 00:43:47.300
You put bromine in, which of
these 

00:43:47.300 --> 00:43:48.533
things is going to operate? 

00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:52.933
Is there any handle you have on
it? 

00:43:52.933 --> 00:43:53.800
STUDENT: You can use 

00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:55.833
photoinitiation to get the
radical. 

00:43:55.833 --> 00:43:57.233
PROFESSOR: If you use-- noticed
this 

00:43:57.233 --> 00:43:59.667
was done in the dark. 

00:43:59.667 --> 00:44:03.233
If we can't get the radical, we
won't do this one. 

00:44:03.233 --> 00:44:06.367
So one idea is to keep it in the
dark. 

00:44:06.367 --> 00:44:07.633
Don't use the initiator. 

00:44:10.300 --> 00:44:13.267
So that'll allow us to do this
one, that dark one. 

00:44:13.267 --> 00:44:15.433
How do we get this one to
happen? 

00:44:15.433 --> 00:44:19.400
Well you might say we use light
or use an initiator. 

00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:22.467
But this can still happen if you
have the light on. 

00:44:22.467 --> 00:44:24.900
You can still get that. 

00:44:24.900 --> 00:44:26.433
It doesn't require dark. 

00:44:26.433 --> 00:44:29.100
It's just this one requires
light. 

00:44:29.100 --> 00:44:31.300
So this one would also be going
on, but there's another 

00:44:31.300 --> 00:44:37.000
way which is to minimize the
concentration of Br2. 

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:39.900
Now, why does that have anything
to do with it? 

00:44:39.900 --> 00:44:42.467
This is a really interesting
thing about the kinetics of 

00:44:42.467 --> 00:44:44.833
the top reaction. 

00:44:44.833 --> 00:44:49.067
It's second order in Br2. 

00:44:49.067 --> 00:44:51.333
That looks really weird. 

00:44:51.333 --> 00:44:55.967
Why do you need two molecules of
bromine 

00:44:55.967 --> 00:44:57.233
in order to do this? 

00:44:59.967 --> 00:45:06.533
The reason is that when you get
the Br plus coming on Br minus

00:45:06.533 --> 00:45:08.300
is coming off from Br2.

00:45:08.300 --> 00:45:10.300
So you have to get Br minus. 

00:45:10.300 --> 00:45:14.733
And, in fact, Br minus is
stabilized by reacting with 

00:45:14.733 --> 00:45:18.333
Br2 to give Br3 minus. 

00:45:18.333 --> 00:45:22.267
So, in fact, what happens is
that the Br, the second Br2 

00:45:22.267 --> 00:45:25.867
helps the bromide leave from Br
plus in a non-polar 

00:45:25.867 --> 00:45:27.833
solvent like this. 

00:45:27.833 --> 00:45:32.333
So it's second order, So that
means if you have a really low 

00:45:32.333 --> 00:45:37.267
concentration of Br2, this one
gets really slow, because it's 

00:45:37.267 --> 00:45:39.800
a bad leaving group. 

00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:44.833
It's like making the Br minus
leave by putting Br2 in is 

00:45:44.833 --> 00:45:48.333
like making OH leave by putting
a proton on it. Make it a 

00:45:48.333 --> 00:45:50.333
better leaving group. 

00:45:50.333 --> 00:45:54.433
So if we minimize the
concentration of Br2 we'll slow

00:45:54.433 --> 00:45:57.200
this one down, but that reaction
with Br2 is very 

00:45:57.200 --> 00:46:01.933
fast. Remember, the first step
of this is endothermic, is 

00:46:01.933 --> 00:46:05.833
slow, but that's step is really
fast. So we can 

00:46:05.833 --> 00:46:08.500
tolerate a low concentration of
Br for this purpose, but 

00:46:08.500 --> 00:46:11.200
how are you going to do it. 

00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:14.033
Because suppose you put in just
a teeny 

00:46:14.033 --> 00:46:15.567
amount of Br2 there. 

00:46:15.567 --> 00:46:19.200
OK, this starts in, but quickly
you've exhausted the 

00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:24.433
Br2, and now the radical chain
stops, 

00:46:24.433 --> 00:46:27.667
and that's the end of the line.

00:46:27.667 --> 00:46:30.867
Now you could say I'll very
carefully 

00:46:30.867 --> 00:46:34.567
run in Br2 very slowly. 

00:46:34.567 --> 00:46:35.633
Just to balance out. 

00:46:35.633 --> 00:46:39.267
But when you put a drop in the
bromine concentration is 

00:46:39.267 --> 00:46:43.500
higher in that drop, locally, so
you're going to get this 

00:46:43.500 --> 00:46:48.800
reaction, because of the local
high concentration of Br2. 

00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:50.733
But this is where Ziegler comes
in with 

00:46:50.733 --> 00:46:53.633
his clever NBS molecule. 

00:46:53.633 --> 00:46:57.300
This looks like it's tedious to
impossible to maintain a 

00:46:57.300 --> 00:47:00.567
really low concentration of Br2
while it's being consumed 

00:47:00.567 --> 00:47:04.867
all the time. But notice that
this reaction also yielded 

00:47:04.867 --> 00:47:09.567
HBr, whenever that happens. 

00:47:09.567 --> 00:47:16.300
And if we have
N-bromosuccinimide plus HBr 

00:47:16.300 --> 00:47:19.500
that's the reaction we looked
out on the previous slide that 

00:47:19.500 --> 00:47:23.633
destroys N-bromosuccinimide--
takes it back to succinimide. 

00:47:23.633 --> 00:47:25.900
And you remember what the other
product was? 

00:47:29.633 --> 00:47:31.600
Br2. 

00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:33.600
So isn't this neat? 

00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:39.100
Whenever a Br2 molecule gets
used up, a new Br2 molecule is 

00:47:39.100 --> 00:47:42.300
created by this reaction. 

00:47:42.300 --> 00:47:45.533
So it automatically maintains
the minimum possible 

00:47:45.533 --> 00:47:48.767
concentration of Br2. Every time
you use it, 

00:47:48.767 --> 00:47:49.633
you get a new one. 

00:47:49.633 --> 00:47:52.233
You don't have to sit there with
your burette, trying to run 

00:47:52.233 --> 00:47:53.667
it in very slowly. 

00:47:53.667 --> 00:47:57.100
So that's the trick with
N-bromosuccinimide. 

00:47:57.100 --> 00:48:00.167
Now, so we've looked here at a
lot of different allylic 

00:48:00.167 --> 00:48:02.733
stabilizations. 

00:48:02.733 --> 00:48:06.600
But dienes can also be
conjugated, and how much is 

00:48:06.600 --> 00:48:08.933
that worth? 

00:48:08.933 --> 00:48:11.400
We can look at the heat of
combustion of this one, where 

00:48:11.400 --> 00:48:14.833
they're not conjugated and this
one, where they are across 

00:48:14.833 --> 00:48:17.700
a single bond, these isomers of
one another. 

00:48:17.700 --> 00:48:20.467
And you can see that it's the
conjugation seems be worth 

00:48:20.467 --> 00:48:22.900
about 7 kilocalories per mole. 

00:48:22.900 --> 00:48:25.767
Or down here it seems to be
worth about 8 

00:48:25.767 --> 00:48:27.700
kilocalories per mole. 

00:48:27.700 --> 00:48:30.333
But these numbers, although,
they're claimed to be very 

00:48:30.333 --> 00:48:34.533
precise, are big numbers. 

00:48:34.533 --> 00:48:37.067
And I think that precision might
be a little bit 

00:48:37.067 --> 00:48:38.867
overstated. 

00:48:38.867 --> 00:48:41.767
If you look at the heat of
hydrogenation, the heat that 

00:48:41.767 --> 00:48:45.100
is given off when you add H2,
then you can see that these 

00:48:45.100 --> 00:48:46.133
are all 30. 

00:48:46.133 --> 00:48:50.000
I'm going to let you go after
you make two guesses. 

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:52.300
Now guess what each-- 

00:48:52.300 --> 00:48:54.533
this double bond, this double
bond, this double bond, they 

00:48:54.533 --> 00:48:57.833
all give off 30 kilocalories per
mole of heat. 

00:48:57.833 --> 00:49:00.900
How much should this one give
off? 

00:49:00.900 --> 00:49:04.800
When you hydrogenate both double
bonds. 

00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:05.700
Leen? 

00:49:05.700 --> 00:49:07.567
STUDENT: 60. 

00:49:07.567 --> 00:49:09.100
PROFESSOR: Right. 

00:49:09.100 --> 00:49:11.900
How about this one? 

00:49:11.900 --> 00:49:12.400
Natalie? 

00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:15.100
STUDENT: 60. 

00:49:15.100 --> 00:49:16.967
PROFESSOR: How about this one? 

00:49:16.967 --> 00:49:21.933
STUDENT: Something bigger. Much
more. 62.

00:49:21.933 --> 00:49:24.767
Oh. Much less. 

00:49:24.767 --> 00:49:25.867
PROFESSOR: So conjugation. 

00:49:25.867 --> 00:49:27.133
This one is more stable. 

00:49:27.133 --> 00:49:29.767
It doesn't give off as much
heat. 

00:49:29.767 --> 00:49:31.600
And it seems to be stable by
about four 

00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:34.100
kilocalories per mole. 

00:49:34.100 --> 00:49:36.500
OK, now you can go.

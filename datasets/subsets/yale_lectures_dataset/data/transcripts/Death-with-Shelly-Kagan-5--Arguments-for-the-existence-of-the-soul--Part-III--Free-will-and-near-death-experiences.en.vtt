00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:01.610
Professor Shelly Kagan:
All right.

00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:05.231
We've been talking about
arguments that might give us

00:00:05.231 --> 00:00:09.340
reason to believe in the
existence of an immaterial soul.

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:12.706
The kinds of arguments we've
been considering so far all fall

00:00:12.706 --> 00:00:15.456
under the general rubric of
"inference to the best

00:00:15.456 --> 00:00:18.691
explanation."
We posit--or the fans of souls

00:00:18.691 --> 00:00:23.254
posit--the existence of souls so
as to explain something that

00:00:23.254 --> 00:00:27.069
needs explaining about us.
I've gone through a series of

00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:29.566
such arguments,
and the one that we ended with

00:00:29.566 --> 00:00:32.785
last time was the suggestion
that we need to believe in the

00:00:32.785 --> 00:00:36.226
existence of a soul in order to
explain the fact that we've got

00:00:36.226 --> 00:00:38.852
free will.
The fact that we've got free

00:00:38.852 --> 00:00:42.158
will is something that most of
us take for granted about

00:00:42.158 --> 00:00:44.723
ourselves.
But the complaint then,

00:00:44.723 --> 00:00:48.989
or the objection to the
physicalist, takes the form that

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.332
we couldn't be a merely physical
entity because no merely

00:00:53.332 --> 00:00:56.590
physical entity could have free
will.

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.038
But we've got free will,
so there's got to be something

00:00:59.038 --> 00:01:01.170
more to us than just being a
physical object.

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.614
Now, if we push the dualist to
explain what is it about free

00:01:05.614 --> 00:01:09.607
will that rules out the
possibility that we are merely

00:01:09.607 --> 00:01:12.968
physical objects,
I think the natural suggestion

00:01:12.968 --> 00:01:16.583
to spell out the argument goes
like this, and this is where we

00:01:16.583 --> 00:01:20.223
were at the end of last time.
The thought is that,

00:01:20.223 --> 00:01:24.407
there's a kind of
incompatibility with being free

00:01:24.407 --> 00:01:28.068
and being determined.
I mean, after all from the

00:01:28.068 --> 00:01:31.567
physicalist's point of view,
we're just a kind of glorified

00:01:31.567 --> 00:01:34.168
robot,
able to do all sorts of things

00:01:34.168 --> 00:01:38.010
that most robots in most science
fiction movies can do.

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.394
But still, in a sense,
we're just a glorified physical

00:01:40.394 --> 00:01:42.200
object.
We're just a robot.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.019
And robots, the objection goes,
are programmed;

00:01:46.019 --> 00:01:48.709
they necessarily follow their
program.

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:51.036
More generally speaking,
we might say,

00:01:51.036 --> 00:01:53.930
they're subject to
deterministic laws--that,

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.139
as physical objects,
it's true of them that they

00:01:57.139 --> 00:02:01.440
must do what the laws of physics
and laws of nature require that

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.107
they do.
And the laws of physics

00:02:04.107 --> 00:02:08.687
are--take a deterministic form,
determinism being a bit of

00:02:08.687 --> 00:02:13.587
philosopher's jargon for when
it's true of these laws that--or

00:02:13.587 --> 00:02:18.889
a physical--or a system--that if
you set it up a certain way,

00:02:18.889 --> 00:02:23.249
cause and effect plays out such
that, given that initial setup,

00:02:23.249 --> 00:02:25.710
the very same effect must
follow.

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:29.256
It's determined by the laws of
nature that the effect that

00:02:29.256 --> 00:02:31.620
follows will follow from that
cause.

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.217
And so, if you rewind the tape
and play it again over and over

00:02:35.217 --> 00:02:38.686
and over again,
each time you set things up the

00:02:38.686 --> 00:02:43.699
very same way they must move or
transform or change or end up in

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:47.930
the very same state.
Well, that's what determinism

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.287
is all about.
And intuitively,

00:02:50.287 --> 00:02:54.402
it seems plausible to many
people that you couldn't have

00:02:54.402 --> 00:02:57.620
free will and be subject to
determinism.

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.789
Because the notion of free will
was that even if I was in the

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:03.483
very same spot again,
the very same situation again,

00:03:03.483 --> 00:03:07.284
I could've chosen differently.
So I wasn't determined or

00:03:07.284 --> 00:03:10.090
predetermined to make that
choice.

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.752
So if we were to spell out the
argument somewhat more fully,

00:03:14.752 --> 00:03:17.439
it might be,
"We have free will,

00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:22.006
but you can't both have free
will and be subject to

00:03:22.006 --> 00:03:26.389
determinism or subject to
deterministic laws."

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:29.699
And every physical object,
or every purely physical

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:33.074
object, is subject to
deterministic laws because the

00:03:33.074 --> 00:03:35.590
laws of physics are
deterministic.

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.223
You put these things together
and you get the conclusion that

00:03:39.223 --> 00:03:42.613
we, since we've got free will,
can't be a purely physical

00:03:42.613 --> 00:03:44.530
object.
There must be something more

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.194
than the purely physical to us.
That's the argument I put up on

00:03:48.194 --> 00:03:50.789
the board at the end of last
class.

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:52.940
And here we've got it up here
now.

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:56.671
One, we have free will.
Two, nothing subject to

00:03:56.671 --> 00:04:00.951
determinism has free will.
Three, all purely physical

00:04:00.951 --> 00:04:03.639
systems are subject to
determinism.

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:07.699
So--a conclusion--we are not a
purely physical system.

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:10.495
To explain the fact that we've
got free will,

00:04:10.495 --> 00:04:13.735
so the objection goes,
we have to appeal to--we have

00:04:13.735 --> 00:04:16.149
to posit--the existence of a
soul,

00:04:16.149 --> 00:04:20.168
something non-physical,
something more than purely

00:04:20.168 --> 00:04:23.300
physical.
Well, that's the argument.

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:27.009
But I don't myself find the
argument compelling.

00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:32.301
Now, the first thing to notice
is that to get the conclusion we

00:04:32.301 --> 00:04:35.636
need all three premises.
Give up the conclusion that

00:04:35.636 --> 00:04:38.116
we've got--Give up the premise
that "we've got free will," it

00:04:38.116 --> 00:04:39.769
won't follow that we're
non-physical.

00:04:39.769 --> 00:04:42.418
Even if something that did have
free will would have to be

00:04:42.418 --> 00:04:44.370
non-physical,
it wouldn't follow that we're

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.808
non-physical.
That's true for each one of the

00:04:46.808 --> 00:04:48.572
premises.
Give it up, the conclusion

00:04:48.572 --> 00:04:52.089
doesn't go through.
And the interesting thing is

00:04:52.089 --> 00:04:57.870
that each one of these premises
could be plausibly challenged.

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:01.437
Now, as I said last time,
the subject of free will--or

00:05:01.437 --> 00:05:05.303
free will, determinism,
causation and responsibility,

00:05:05.303 --> 00:05:09.370
this cluster of problems--is an
extremely difficult and

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:13.473
complicated physical problem.
And we could easily devote an

00:05:13.473 --> 00:05:15.459
entire semester to discussing
it.

00:05:15.459 --> 00:05:20.698
So all we're doing here is the
most quick and superficial

00:05:20.698 --> 00:05:23.865
glance.
But still, let me quickly point

00:05:23.865 --> 00:05:28.214
out why you could resist the
argument from free will to the

00:05:28.214 --> 00:05:30.763
existence of a soul.
First of all,

00:05:30.763 --> 00:05:33.423
as I just noted,
the argument needs premise

00:05:33.423 --> 00:05:35.557
number one.
It's got to be the case,

00:05:35.557 --> 00:05:38.519
to prove that we've got a
soul--at least for this argument

00:05:38.519 --> 00:05:41.741
to work to prove that we've got
a soul--it's got to be the case

00:05:41.741 --> 00:05:45.420
that we've got free will.
Now, that could be challenged.

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:50.590
There are philosophers who have
said we certainly believe that

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:54.320
we've got free will,
but it's an illusion.

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:57.778
We don't really have free will.
Indeed, why don't we have free

00:05:57.778 --> 00:05:59.778
will?
For precisely the reasons that

00:05:59.778 --> 00:06:02.269
are pointed to by the rest of
the argument.

00:06:02.269 --> 00:06:03.804
They might say,
"Oh, well, you know,

00:06:03.804 --> 00:06:06.560
we're physical objects;
determinism is true of us.

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:09.534
No physical object that's
subject to determinism could

00:06:09.534 --> 00:06:12.060
have free will,
so we don't have free will.

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:18.550
Of course, we mistakenly
believe we've got free will.

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:23.070
We are physical objects that
labor under the illusion that we

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:25.255
have free will,
but after all,

00:06:25.255 --> 00:06:28.795
free will isn't something that
you can just see,

00:06:28.795 --> 00:06:31.753
right?
You can't peer into your mind

00:06:31.753 --> 00:06:34.870
and see the fact that you've got
free will.

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:38.351
Yes, we've got the sense that
we could've acted differently,

00:06:38.351 --> 00:06:41.454
but maybe that's an illusion."
As I say, there are

00:06:41.454 --> 00:06:45.291
philosophers who've argued that
way, have denied that we have

00:06:45.291 --> 00:06:49.320
free will and if we do conclude
that we don't actually have free

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:52.007
will,
then we no longer have this

00:06:52.007 --> 00:06:54.889
argument for the existence of a
soul.

00:06:54.889 --> 00:06:56.550
It's a way to avoid the
argument;

00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:00.892
although, for what it's worth,
I should mention I don't myself

00:07:00.892 --> 00:07:04.379
believe that it's false that we
have free will.

00:07:04.379 --> 00:07:06.600
That is to say,
I do think premise one is true.

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:09.689
I myself think we do have free
will.

00:07:09.689 --> 00:07:13.290
So although I don't like,
I don't believe the argument is

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:16.632
sound--premise one doesn't
happen to be the premise I

00:07:16.632 --> 00:07:18.690
myself would want to reject.

00:07:22.029 --> 00:07:23.996
But there are other,
there are two other key

00:07:23.996 --> 00:07:26.683
premises.
What about premise number

00:07:26.683 --> 00:07:30.962
three, "All purely physical
systems are subject to

00:07:30.962 --> 00:07:33.574
determinism."
Well, we need that premise as

00:07:33.574 --> 00:07:36.532
well to make the argument go.
Suppose we think,

00:07:36.532 --> 00:07:41.440
"Look, you can't have free will
and determinism.

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:44.515
You can't combine them."
The view that you can't combine

00:07:44.515 --> 00:07:47.238
them is sometimes known as
"incompatibilism" for the

00:07:47.238 --> 00:07:49.636
obvious reason.
It's the view that these two

00:07:49.636 --> 00:07:54.388
things are incompatible.
You can't have determinism and

00:07:54.388 --> 00:07:57.786
free will.
Suppose we do believe in

00:07:57.786 --> 00:08:02.569
incompatibilism and believe that
we've got free will.

00:08:02.569 --> 00:08:06.932
It would follow then that we're
not subject to deterministic

00:08:06.932 --> 00:08:08.868
laws.
Well, the dualist says,

00:08:08.868 --> 00:08:12.568
"That shows us that we have to
believe that there's something

00:08:12.568 --> 00:08:15.050
non-physical about us.
Because after all,

00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:17.350
premise three:
‘All purely physical systems

00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:21.404
are subject to determinism.'
Isn't it true after all that

00:08:21.404 --> 00:08:25.839
the basic laws of physics are
deterministic laws?"

00:08:25.839 --> 00:08:28.722
And the answer is,
"Well it's not so clear that it

00:08:28.722 --> 00:08:31.454
is true."
Which is just to say that

00:08:31.454 --> 00:08:36.039
premise three of the argument
can be rejected as well.

00:08:36.039 --> 00:08:39.520
Now, at this point I have to
just confess,

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:42.830
as I've confessed at other
times before,

00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:46.649
three is a claim about
empirical science.

00:08:46.649 --> 00:08:50.570
What does our best theory about
the laws of nature tell us?

00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:54.550
And I'm no scientist and I'm no
specialist in sort of empirical

00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:58.421
matters, and believe me,
I'm no authority on quantum

00:08:58.421 --> 00:09:02.580
mechanics, our best theory of
fundamental physics.

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:06.754
Still, I take it--I
gather--here's what I'm

00:09:06.754 --> 00:09:11.524
told--that the standard
interpretation of quantum

00:09:11.524 --> 00:09:15.272
mechanics says that,
despite what many of us

00:09:15.272 --> 00:09:18.768
might've otherwise believed,
the fundamental laws of physics

00:09:18.768 --> 00:09:22.170
are not,
in fact, deterministic.

00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:26.528
What does that mean?
Suppose we've got some sort of

00:09:26.528 --> 00:09:30.590
radioactive atom,
which has a certain chance of

00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:32.580
decaying.
What does that mean?

00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:35.674
Well, it means that,
you know, there's maybe,

00:09:35.674 --> 00:09:39.823
let's say, an 80 percent chance
that in the next 24 hours it

00:09:39.823 --> 00:09:42.657
will break down.
Eighty percent of atoms that

00:09:42.657 --> 00:09:45.410
are set up like that break down
in the next 24 hours;

00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:49.498
20 percent of them don't.
Now, according to quantum

00:09:49.498 --> 00:09:51.801
mechanics under the standard
interpretation,

00:09:51.801 --> 00:09:53.889
that's all there is to say
about it.

00:09:53.889 --> 00:09:57.197
You have an atom like that,
80 percent chance in the next

00:09:57.197 --> 00:10:01.090
24 hours it will break down.
Suppose it does break down!

00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:04.136
Can we say why it broke down?
Sure.

00:10:04.136 --> 00:10:06.429
We can say, "Well,
after all there was an 80

00:10:06.429 --> 00:10:09.559
percent chance that it would."
Take an atom that after 24

00:10:09.559 --> 00:10:13.041
hours hasn't broken down.
Can we say why it hasn't broken

00:10:13.041 --> 00:10:13.943
down?
Sure.

00:10:13.943 --> 00:10:18.679
There was a 20 percent chance
that it wouldn't.

00:10:18.679 --> 00:10:23.750
Can we explain why the ones
that do break down break down

00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:28.640
and the ones that don't break
down don't break down?

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:31.056
No.
All we can say is,

00:10:31.056 --> 00:10:35.279
there was an 80 percent chance
it would, 20 percent chance it

00:10:35.279 --> 00:10:38.940
wouldn't, so most of them do,
some of them don't.

00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:43.190
That's as deep as the
explanation goes.

00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:45.398
There is nothing more.
Now, you know,

00:10:45.398 --> 00:10:47.424
when we've got our
deterministic hats on,

00:10:47.424 --> 00:10:50.322
we think to ourselves,
"There's got to be some

00:10:50.322 --> 00:10:54.014
underlying causal explanation,
some feature about the

00:10:54.014 --> 00:10:58.417
break-down atoms that explains
why they broke down and that was

00:10:58.417 --> 00:11:02.605
missing from the non-break-down
atoms that explains why they

00:11:02.605 --> 00:11:06.000
don't break down.
After all, determinism, right?

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.947
If you set up the atoms exactly
the same way,

00:11:07.947 --> 00:11:09.539
they've always got to break
down."

00:11:09.539 --> 00:11:12.314
But the answer is,
according to the standard

00:11:12.314 --> 00:11:15.734
interpretation of quantum
mechanics, that's not how it

00:11:15.734 --> 00:11:17.964
works.
All there is to say is,

00:11:17.964 --> 00:11:21.821
"Some of these are going to
break down, and some of these

00:11:21.821 --> 00:11:24.099
won't."
The fundamental laws of

00:11:24.099 --> 00:11:27.625
physics, according to the
standard interpretation of

00:11:27.625 --> 00:11:30.389
quantum mechanics,
are probabilistic.

00:11:30.389 --> 00:11:38.040
Determinism is not true at the
level of fundamental physics.

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:40.983
Well, that's what I'm told.
Believe me, I'm in no position

00:11:40.983 --> 00:11:42.789
to say, but that's what I'm
told.

00:11:42.789 --> 00:11:45.729
And of course,
if that's true,

00:11:45.729 --> 00:11:51.333
then premise three is false.
It just isn't true that all

00:11:51.333 --> 00:11:56.269
purely physical systems are
subject to determinism.

00:11:56.269 --> 00:11:59.802
So even if it does turn out
that you can't have free will

00:11:59.802 --> 00:12:02.389
and determinism,
that doesn't rule out the

00:12:02.389 --> 00:12:05.669
possibility that we are purely
physical objects,

00:12:05.669 --> 00:12:09.403
because not all purely physical
systems are subject to

00:12:09.403 --> 00:12:10.390
determinism.

00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:17.676
If determinism isn't true of us
at the fundamental level,

00:12:17.676 --> 00:12:22.210
then even if you couldn't both
have determinism and free will,

00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:25.294
we could still have free will,
and yet, for all that,

00:12:25.294 --> 00:12:27.370
still be purely physical
systems.

00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:34.028
While I'm busy pointing out
ways in which the argument

00:12:34.028 --> 00:12:36.666
doesn't succeed,
I also want to just take a

00:12:36.666 --> 00:12:39.995
moment and mention that premise
two is also subject to

00:12:39.995 --> 00:12:42.322
criticism.
Premise two was the

00:12:42.322 --> 00:12:46.357
incompatibilist claim that,
"nothing subject to determinism

00:12:46.357 --> 00:12:49.380
has free will."
You can't combine them.

00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:53.544
They're incompatible.
Now, incompatibilism,

00:12:53.544 --> 00:12:57.997
I take it, is probably
something like the common-sense

00:12:57.997 --> 00:13:00.633
view here.
It's the view that probably

00:13:00.633 --> 00:13:03.377
most of you believe,
but again, it's worth noting

00:13:03.377 --> 00:13:05.950
that philosophically it can be
challenged.

00:13:05.950 --> 00:13:08.842
There are philosophers--and
here I'll tip my hat and say,

00:13:08.842 --> 00:13:11.889
I'm one of them--there are
philosophers who believe that,

00:13:11.889 --> 00:13:19.918
in fact, the idea of free will
is not incompatible with

00:13:19.918 --> 00:13:24.921
determinism.
So even if determinism were

00:13:24.921 --> 00:13:31.090
true of us, that wouldn't rule
out our having free will,

00:13:31.090 --> 00:13:34.459
because you can--appearances to
the contrary

00:13:34.459 --> 00:13:38.770
notwithstanding--have both
determinism and free will.

00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:42.983
They're compatible.
Hence, this view is known as

00:13:42.983 --> 00:13:46.240
compatibilism.
If we accept compatibilism,

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:50.283
we'll be able to say,
"Look, maybe we have free will

00:13:50.283 --> 00:13:54.517
and determinism is true of us;
but for all that,

00:13:54.517 --> 00:13:58.610
we're still just purely
physical systems."

00:13:58.610 --> 00:14:01.978
Even if quantum mechanics was
wrong and somehow,

00:14:01.978 --> 00:14:05.920
you know, at the macro level
all the indeterminism boils

00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:10.006
out--whatever--and at the macro
level we are deterministic

00:14:10.006 --> 00:14:11.879
systems,
so what?

00:14:11.879 --> 00:14:16.076
If a deterministic system could
nonetheless have free will,

00:14:16.076 --> 00:14:19.259
we could still be purely
physical systems.

00:14:19.259 --> 00:14:23.033
Now, mind you,
I haven't said anything today

00:14:23.033 --> 00:14:26.982
to convince you of the truth of
compatibilism,

00:14:26.982 --> 00:14:30.230
nor am I going to try to do
that.

00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:35.417
My point here was only to say
we shouldn't be so quick to

00:14:35.417 --> 00:14:41.345
think that we have to believe in
the existence of a soul in order

00:14:41.345 --> 00:14:46.458
to explain our having free will.
It takes all of the premises of

00:14:46.458 --> 00:14:49.730
the argument to get the
conclusion that the soul exists.

00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:54.830
And each one of the premises
can be challenged.

00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:57.785
And here I mean not merely,
well, logically speaking,

00:14:57.785 --> 00:15:00.741
you know, of course you can
reject any premise of any

00:15:00.741 --> 00:15:01.708
argument.
No.

00:15:01.708 --> 00:15:05.899
I mean, there are reasonable
philosophical or scientific

00:15:05.899 --> 00:15:10.090
grounds for worrying about each
one of the premises.

00:15:10.090 --> 00:15:13.859
The argument requires a lot.
That doesn't prove that the

00:15:13.859 --> 00:15:16.247
argument fails,
but it does mean that you're

00:15:16.247 --> 00:15:19.635
going to have your work cut out
for you if you're going to use

00:15:19.635 --> 00:15:22.690
this route to arguing for the
existence of a soul.

00:15:22.690 --> 00:15:25.120
All right.
Let's recap.

00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:28.118
As I said, we've been
considering different kinds of

00:15:28.118 --> 00:15:30.470
arguments for the existence of a
soul,

00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:34.071
each of which appeals to some
feature about us--our

00:15:34.071 --> 00:15:37.740
creativity, our ability to feel,
the fact that we have a

00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:40.233
qualitative aspect of
experience, our ability to

00:15:40.233 --> 00:15:43.584
reason--what have you.
Some fact about us that calls

00:15:43.584 --> 00:15:46.934
out for explanation,
and the claim on the part of

00:15:46.934 --> 00:15:50.215
the dualists was,
we couldn't explain it without

00:15:50.215 --> 00:15:53.892
appealing to a soul.
And I've argued--I've shared

00:15:53.892 --> 00:15:58.033
with you my reasons for thinking
that those arguments are not

00:15:58.033 --> 00:16:00.951
compelling.
But notice that all of the

00:16:00.951 --> 00:16:05.005
kinds of considerations I
pointed to so far are what we

00:16:05.005 --> 00:16:09.360
might think of as everyday,
familiar features about us.

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:13.344
It's an everyday occurrence
that we can think and reason and

00:16:13.344 --> 00:16:16.654
feel and be creative,
or choose otherwise and have

00:16:16.654 --> 00:16:20.365
free will.
Maybe the better arguments for

00:16:20.365 --> 00:16:25.250
the soul focus not on the
everyday but on the unusual,

00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:29.340
on the supernatural.
Here we might then have an

00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:32.296
entire other family of
arguments, set of

00:16:32.296 --> 00:16:35.933
arguments--again,
still of the form "inference to

00:16:35.933 --> 00:16:40.544
the best explanation."
Maybe we need to posit the soul

00:16:40.544 --> 00:16:45.107
in order to explain ghosts.
Maybe we need to posit the soul

00:16:45.107 --> 00:16:49.069
in order to explain ESP;
maybe we need to posit the soul

00:16:49.069 --> 00:16:52.120
in order to explain near-death
experiences.

00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:56.304
Maybe we need to posit the soul
in order to explain what goes on

00:16:56.304 --> 00:17:00.490
in séances or communications
from the dead or what have you.

00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:03.250
For any one of those,
we could again run an argument

00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:05.523
where we say,
"Look, here is something that

00:17:05.523 --> 00:17:08.829
needs explaining.
The best explanation appeals to

00:17:08.829 --> 00:17:11.408
the soul."
Now, I'm going to be rather

00:17:11.408 --> 00:17:14.489
quicker in discussing this
family of arguments,

00:17:14.489 --> 00:17:17.838
but let me take at least a
couple of minutes and do

00:17:17.838 --> 00:17:21.302
something about that.
Take, for example,

00:17:21.302 --> 00:17:25.775
near-death experiences.
This is something that you read

00:17:25.775 --> 00:17:29.846
a bit about in the selection
from Schick and Vaughn in your

00:17:29.846 --> 00:17:33.422
course packet.
The basic idea was probably

00:17:33.422 --> 00:17:38.277
familiar to most of you anyway,
that the following thing

00:17:38.277 --> 00:17:41.971
happens with people who,
you know, maybe their heart

00:17:41.971 --> 00:17:44.059
goes into a cardiac arrest--what
have you.

00:17:44.059 --> 00:17:47.927
They die on the operating
table, but then they're brought

00:17:47.927 --> 00:17:49.930
back to life,
as we put it.

00:17:49.930 --> 00:17:53.437
And many such people,
when we question them

00:17:53.437 --> 00:17:57.279
afterwards, have a very striking
experience.

00:17:57.279 --> 00:18:01.078
And one of the things that's
striking is, how similar the

00:18:01.078 --> 00:18:04.741
experience is from person to
person and from culture to

00:18:04.741 --> 00:18:07.589
culture--that they've got some
notion,

00:18:07.589 --> 00:18:10.721
as they were dead on the
operating table,

00:18:10.721 --> 00:18:14.989
of leaving their body.
Perhaps they begin to view

00:18:14.989 --> 00:18:18.849
their body from up--floating up
above it.

00:18:18.849 --> 00:18:22.219
Eventually, perhaps,
they leave the operating room

00:18:22.219 --> 00:18:25.589
altogether in this experience
that they're having,

00:18:25.589 --> 00:18:28.890
and they have a feeling of joy
and euphoria;

00:18:28.890 --> 00:18:32.008
they have some experience of
going through a tunnel,

00:18:32.008 --> 00:18:34.759
seeing some light at the end of
the tunnel.

00:18:34.759 --> 00:18:39.055
Perhaps at the other end of the
tunnel they begin to have some

00:18:39.055 --> 00:18:43.422
communications or see some loved
one who has died previously or

00:18:43.422 --> 00:18:47.717
perhaps some famous religious
person in their--in the teaching

00:18:47.717 --> 00:18:51.380
of their tradition--their
religious tradition.

00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:55.119
They have the sense that what
they've done is basically died

00:18:55.119 --> 00:18:58.857
and gone to heaven.
But then suddenly they get

00:18:58.857 --> 00:19:04.690
yanked back, and they wake up,
you know, in the hospital room.

00:19:04.690 --> 00:19:07.039
So they've had near-death
experiences.

00:19:07.039 --> 00:19:09.953
Or perhaps a better way to put
it would be they've had death

00:19:09.953 --> 00:19:12.620
experiences but then have been
brought back to life.

00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:16.185
Now, there it is, right?
You survey people,

00:19:16.185 --> 00:19:17.829
and people have these
experiences.

00:19:17.829 --> 00:19:22.579
And now we have to ask
ourselves, "What explains this?"

00:19:22.579 --> 00:19:26.616
And here's a perfectly
straightforward and natural

00:19:26.616 --> 00:19:29.859
explanation.
These people died.

00:19:29.859 --> 00:19:34.589
Their bodies died,
and they went to the next

00:19:34.589 --> 00:19:37.329
world.
They went to the next life.

00:19:37.329 --> 00:19:41.759
They went to heaven but then
were yanked back.

00:19:41.759 --> 00:19:45.490
Now, their bodies were lying
there on the operating table;

00:19:45.490 --> 00:19:48.912
their bodies weren't in heaven.
So something non-bodily went to

00:19:48.912 --> 00:19:51.130
heaven.
That's how the explanation goes.

00:19:51.130 --> 00:19:56.012
It's a natural,
straightforward explanation of

00:19:56.012 --> 00:20:00.018
what's gone on here.
Hence, inference to the best

00:20:00.018 --> 00:20:02.800
explanation.
We need to posit the soul,

00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:07.173
something immaterial that
survives the death of the body,

00:20:07.173 --> 00:20:10.609
that can leave the body,
go up to heaven;

00:20:10.609 --> 00:20:14.073
though, as it happens in these
cases, the tie is never

00:20:14.073 --> 00:20:16.420
completely broken.
They get yanked back;

00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:19.500
the soul gets yanked back by
whatever cause,

00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:23.369
and reconnected to the body.
It's as though we might think

00:20:23.369 --> 00:20:26.750
of there being two rooms,
to use a kind of analogy here.

00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:30.125
There is the room that this
world represents,

00:20:30.125 --> 00:20:33.959
this life represents.
And what happens in these

00:20:33.959 --> 00:20:39.008
experiences is that your soul
leaves this room and goes into a

00:20:39.008 --> 00:20:42.604
second room,
the room of the next world or

00:20:42.604 --> 00:20:45.689
the next life,
but for various reasons,

00:20:45.689 --> 00:20:49.099
isn't allowed to stay in the
next room.

00:20:49.099 --> 00:20:53.539
It gets yanked back to this
room.

00:20:53.539 --> 00:20:56.210
Well, that's a possible
explanation.

00:20:56.210 --> 00:20:59.088
And in a moment,
I'll ask whether it's the best

00:20:59.088 --> 00:21:02.216
possible explanation,
but before we do turn to that

00:21:02.216 --> 00:21:04.690
question,
there is an objection to this

00:21:04.690 --> 00:21:08.127
entire way of looking at things
that's probably worth pausing

00:21:08.127 --> 00:21:11.788
for a moment and considering.
The objection is similar to the

00:21:11.788 --> 00:21:15.446
kind of dismissive attitude that
we saw at the beginning of the

00:21:15.446 --> 00:21:18.810
course about the question,
"Could I survive my death?"

00:21:18.810 --> 00:21:20.456
Well, duh.
Could there be life after there

00:21:20.456 --> 00:21:22.160
is no more life?
Well, of course not.

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:28.480
Here the objection says,
this two-room notion's got to

00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:32.491
be mistaken.
It can't be that what's going

00:21:32.491 --> 00:21:37.497
on in near-death experiences is
that people are reporting about

00:21:37.497 --> 00:21:41.534
what it's like to be dead
because--so the objection

00:21:41.534 --> 00:21:46.280
says--they never really died.
After all, 20 minutes later,

00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:49.710
or whatever it is,
there they are up and about.

00:21:49.710 --> 00:21:51.921
Well, not up and about;
they're presumably lying in

00:21:51.921 --> 00:21:54.519
their hospital beds,
but they're clearly alive.

00:21:54.519 --> 00:21:57.220
Hence, it follows that they
never really died.

00:21:57.220 --> 00:22:01.186
Or, if you want,
you could say maybe they died,

00:22:01.186 --> 00:22:06.531
but since they obviously didn't
die permanently--after all they

00:22:06.531 --> 00:22:11.877
were brought back to life--how
could they possibly tell us what

00:22:11.877 --> 00:22:15.240
it's like to be permanently
dead?

00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:21.629
How can we take their
experiences as veridical reports

00:22:21.629 --> 00:22:25.557
of the afterlife?
Because what we want to know is

00:22:25.557 --> 00:22:28.567
what is like to be permanently
dead, and these people were

00:22:28.567 --> 00:22:32.316
never permanently dead.
So whatever unusual experiences

00:22:32.316 --> 00:22:35.843
they may be having,
they are not reports of the

00:22:35.843 --> 00:22:37.590
afterlife.
That's how the objection goes.

00:22:41.470 --> 00:22:44.608
Although, I think,
I was pausing for a moment to

00:22:44.608 --> 00:22:47.881
raise that objection,
it's not an objection that I

00:22:47.881 --> 00:22:50.819
think we should take all that
seriously.

00:22:50.819 --> 00:22:55.744
Suppose we were to agree,
all right, strictly speaking

00:22:55.744 --> 00:22:59.545
these people didn't die.
Or strictly speaking they

00:22:59.545 --> 00:23:02.039
didn't die, certainly at least,
permanently.

00:23:02.039 --> 00:23:06.180
Does it follow from that that
their experiences should not be

00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:09.630
taken as evidence of what the
afterlife is like?

00:23:09.630 --> 00:23:14.029
I think that's really a
misguided objection.

00:23:14.029 --> 00:23:18.306
Suppose somebody said,
"Look, I spent 20 years living

00:23:18.306 --> 00:23:22.829
in France, and then I came back
to the United States.

00:23:22.829 --> 00:23:25.029
And so I want to tell you what
it's like in France."

00:23:25.029 --> 00:23:29.740
And somebody says,
"You know, you never really

00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:35.080
moved to France permanently.
So your experiences in France,

00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:39.335
whatever they are--interesting
as they may be--can't really

00:23:39.335 --> 00:23:43.809
cast any light on what it would
be like to permanently move to

00:23:43.809 --> 00:23:47.190
France.
You'd say, "Give me a break!"

00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:48.525
Right?
"It's true that,

00:23:48.525 --> 00:23:51.299
of course, I didn't move to
France permanently.

00:23:51.299 --> 00:23:56.750
Still, I have some experience
of France.

00:23:56.750 --> 00:24:00.938
And so I can--a great deal
after all, 20 years--I can give

00:24:00.938 --> 00:24:05.420
you a pretty good idea of what
it's like to live in France,

00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:10.920
even if I didn't move there for
the rest of my life without ever

00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:13.813
coming back."
You can't say quite as much if

00:24:13.813 --> 00:24:16.980
you've only been in France for a
couple of days before coming

00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:19.619
back, but still you can say
something relevant.

00:24:19.619 --> 00:24:23.119
Indeed, suppose I never went
into France at all.

00:24:23.119 --> 00:24:28.472
Suppose all that happened was I
stood right on the border and

00:24:28.472 --> 00:24:32.308
peered into France,
talked to some people in

00:24:32.308 --> 00:24:34.718
France.
They were on the French side of

00:24:34.718 --> 00:24:37.575
the border, I was on the other
side, but I talked to them for a

00:24:37.575 --> 00:24:39.533
while.
Still, I never went in,

00:24:39.533 --> 00:24:43.491
but for all that I might have
something helpful to say about

00:24:43.491 --> 00:24:47.419
what it's like in France.
Well, if that's the right thing

00:24:47.419 --> 00:24:51.385
to say about the France case,
then why not say the same thing

00:24:51.385 --> 00:24:54.029
about the near-death experience
case?

00:24:54.029 --> 00:24:58.775
Even if these people didn't
stay in the second room,

00:24:58.775 --> 00:25:03.334
they didn't stay dead,
they had some experience of

00:25:03.334 --> 00:25:06.465
being dead.
Isn't that relevant to what it

00:25:06.465 --> 00:25:09.200
would be like to be dead?
Or even if we say, "No.

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:12.619
Strictly speaking,
these people didn't die at all.

00:25:12.619 --> 00:25:17.250
They were just on the border
looking in.

00:25:17.250 --> 00:25:20.030
They never, strictly speaking,
died at all."

00:25:20.030 --> 00:25:23.211
So what?
They were on the border looking

00:25:23.211 --> 00:25:25.213
in.
To suggest that that couldn't

00:25:25.213 --> 00:25:28.860
be relevant evidence is like
saying I can't tell you anything

00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:32.630
interesting about what's going
on in the hallway right now,

00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:34.700
because after all I'm not in
the hallway;

00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:37.099
I'm here in the lecture hall.
So what?

00:25:37.099 --> 00:25:40.661
Even though I'm here in the
lecture hall,

00:25:40.661 --> 00:25:46.359
I can see into the hallway and
tell you what's going on in it.

00:25:46.359 --> 00:25:50.586
So attempts to dismiss the
appeal to near-death experiences

00:25:50.586 --> 00:25:54.084
on what we might call
philosophical grounds--this

00:25:54.084 --> 00:25:58.019
would be the bad notion of
philosophy--on philosophical

00:25:58.019 --> 00:26:01.378
grounds,
I think that's got to be

00:26:01.378 --> 00:26:04.626
misguided.
Still, that doesn't mean that

00:26:04.626 --> 00:26:09.053
we should believe the argument
for the existence of the soul

00:26:09.053 --> 00:26:13.360
from near-death experiences,
because the question remains,

00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:17.457
"What's the best explanation of
what's going on in near-death

00:26:17.457 --> 00:26:19.978
experiences?"
Now, one possibility,

00:26:19.978 --> 00:26:23.039
as I suggested,
was what I called a second ago

00:26:23.039 --> 00:26:26.870
the "two-room explanation."
There's the room of this life,

00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:30.211
and there's the room of the
next life and people who have

00:26:30.211 --> 00:26:33.732
near-death experiences either
temporarily were in the second

00:26:33.732 --> 00:26:37.730
room or else at least they were
glancing into the second room.

00:26:37.730 --> 00:26:40.281
That's one possible explanation.
But of course,

00:26:40.281 --> 00:26:45.019
there's a different possible
explanation--the one-room

00:26:45.019 --> 00:26:48.742
explanation.
There's just life,

00:26:48.742 --> 00:26:57.079
this life, and as you come very
close to the wall of the room,

00:26:57.079 --> 00:27:01.750
things end up looking and
seeming and feeling rather

00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:06.420
different than they do in the
middle of the room.

00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:14.374
Now, maybe the one-room
metaphor is not the best

00:27:14.374 --> 00:27:18.201
metaphor, because it immediately
prompts the question,

00:27:18.201 --> 00:27:21.740
"Well, what's on the other side
of the wall?"

00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:24.935
And of course,
the physicalist's suggestion is

00:27:24.935 --> 00:27:28.700
there isn't anything on the
other side of the wall.

00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:32.542
So maybe a better way to talk
about it would just be:

00:27:32.542 --> 00:27:37.256
Life's a biological process;
we're all familiar with that

00:27:37.256 --> 00:27:41.089
process, sort of,
in its middle stretches.

00:27:41.089 --> 00:27:46.729
In its closing stretches,
some fairly unusual biological

00:27:46.729 --> 00:27:50.664
processes kick in.
In rare, but not unheard of,

00:27:50.664 --> 00:27:54.432
cases, some people begin to
have those unusual biological

00:27:54.432 --> 00:27:58.672
processes and then return to the
normal biological processes and

00:27:58.672 --> 00:28:01.835
can talk about what was
happening in the unusual

00:28:01.835 --> 00:28:05.788
biological processes.
Which is just to say,

00:28:05.788 --> 00:28:10.616
we need to offer a
biological/physical explanation

00:28:10.616 --> 00:28:15.049
of what goes on in near-death
experiences.

00:28:15.049 --> 00:28:19.367
Now, mind you,
that's not yet to offer the

00:28:19.367 --> 00:28:24.529
physical explanation;
it's just a promissory note.

00:28:24.529 --> 00:28:27.013
We now have two rival
explanations,

00:28:27.013 --> 00:28:30.447
the soul, dualist,
explanation that we went into

00:28:30.447 --> 00:28:33.369
the other world and the
physicalist,

00:28:33.369 --> 00:28:38.098
promissory note that we can
explain the white lights and the

00:28:38.098 --> 00:28:42.747
feeling of euphoria and seeing
your body from a distance in

00:28:42.747 --> 00:28:46.517
physical terms.
We don't really have very much

00:28:46.517 --> 00:28:50.936
of a physical explanation until
we begin to offer scientific

00:28:50.936 --> 00:28:54.381
accounts of each of those
aspects of near-death

00:28:54.381 --> 00:28:56.640
experience.
But this is,

00:28:56.640 --> 00:29:00.440
in fact, an area on which
scientists work.

00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:03.352
And you saw some of the
beginnings of an explanation

00:29:03.352 --> 00:29:05.980
offered in the reading by Schick
and Vaughn.

00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:08.893
So, for example,
when the body is in stress,

00:29:08.893 --> 00:29:12.551
as would likely happen toward
the end of the biological

00:29:12.551 --> 00:29:15.164
processes,
when the body is in stress,

00:29:15.164 --> 00:29:17.940
certain endorphins get released
by the body.

00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:22.480
Perhaps that explains the
feelings of euphoria.

00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:27.504
When the body is in stress,
we have various unusual

00:29:27.504 --> 00:29:32.630
stimulations of the visual
sections of the brain,

00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:36.467
and perhaps that explains the
white light or the feeling of

00:29:36.467 --> 00:29:40.617
compression in the tunnel.
Now, again, I'm not any kind of

00:29:40.617 --> 00:29:44.100
scientist and so I'm not in any
position to say,

00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:47.880
"Look, here are the details of
the explanation."

00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:53.043
But you get the beginnings of
that sketched in the readings,

00:29:53.043 --> 00:29:57.069
and it's a judgment call you've
got to make.

00:29:57.069 --> 00:30:02.550
Does it seem more plausible
that we can explain these

00:30:02.550 --> 00:30:08.663
experiences in terms of the
traumatic stress that your body

00:30:08.663 --> 00:30:14.460
and brain is going through when
you are near dying?

00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:16.490
Or is it more plausible to
suggest, "No.

00:30:16.490 --> 00:30:20.155
What's happened here is a soul
has been released from

00:30:20.155 --> 00:30:22.976
connection with the body."
For my money,

00:30:22.976 --> 00:30:26.231
I find the beginnings of the
scientific explanation

00:30:26.231 --> 00:30:29.941
sufficiently persuasive and
sufficiently compelling that I

00:30:29.941 --> 00:30:33.586
don't find the argument from
near-death experience--as an

00:30:33.586 --> 00:30:37.688
argument for the existence of a
soul--I don't find it especially

00:30:37.688 --> 00:30:38.990
persuasive.

00:30:42.250 --> 00:30:45.683
Of course, there are various
other things we could appeal to

00:30:45.683 --> 00:30:48.359
in terms of supernatural
occurrences, right?

00:30:48.359 --> 00:30:51.124
I've only mentioned--only
discussed now in detail--one of

00:30:51.124 --> 00:30:52.886
them.
But there are a variety of

00:30:52.886 --> 00:30:55.884
things about people who can
communicate from the dead or

00:30:55.884 --> 00:30:58.009
ghosts or séances or what have
you.

00:30:58.009 --> 00:31:01.893
And what the physicalist would
need to do for each one of

00:31:01.893 --> 00:31:06.470
those--For each one of those you
can imagine a dualist who says,

00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:11.289
"We need to believe in a soul
so as to explain séances.

00:31:11.289 --> 00:31:16.592
How do we explain the fact that
the person who's conducting the

00:31:16.592 --> 00:31:21.210
séance knows things about,
your history that only your

00:31:21.210 --> 00:31:25.236
dead uncle would know?"
The dualist can explain that by

00:31:25.236 --> 00:31:27.119
appealing to ghosts and the
like.

00:31:27.119 --> 00:31:31.060
How does the physicalist
explain things like that?

00:31:31.060 --> 00:31:37.174
Short answer is, I don't know.
I'm not the kind of person who

00:31:37.174 --> 00:31:42.472
makes it his business to try to
explain away those things in

00:31:42.472 --> 00:31:45.179
physicalist,
naturalistic,

00:31:45.179 --> 00:31:48.630
materialistic,
scientific terms.

00:31:48.630 --> 00:31:51.490
But there are people who make
it their business.

00:31:51.490 --> 00:31:53.952
So, for example,
there's a magician--The

00:31:53.952 --> 00:31:56.857
question is not,
could I explain to you how the

00:31:56.857 --> 00:32:00.519
séance manages to do the
amazing things that it does?

00:32:00.519 --> 00:32:02.650
You're wasting your time asking
somebody like me.

00:32:02.650 --> 00:32:06.974
The person to ask is a
magician, somebody whose

00:32:06.974 --> 00:32:12.709
profession it is to fool people
and make it look like they can

00:32:12.709 --> 00:32:16.816
do things with magic.
So in fact, there are

00:32:16.816 --> 00:32:21.669
professional magicians who make
it their business to debunk

00:32:21.669 --> 00:32:27.023
people who claim to genuinely be
in contact with the dead and the

00:32:27.023 --> 00:32:28.731
like.
There's a magician,

00:32:28.731 --> 00:32:31.254
I think his name is The Amazing
Randi, who has a sort of

00:32:31.254 --> 00:32:33.707
standing offer;
he says, "You show me what

00:32:33.707 --> 00:32:37.402
happened in the séance or in
communication with the dead or

00:32:37.402 --> 00:32:40.470
what have you,
and I'll show you how to do it.

00:32:40.470 --> 00:32:45.140
I'll debunk it for you."
Spoiler alert.

00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:50.348
And he has a standing offer,
he says, "I'll pay whatever the

00:32:50.348 --> 00:32:55.556
amount is, $10,000 to the first
person who can document some

00:32:55.556 --> 00:33:00.411
effect done in supernatural
terms that I can't reproduce

00:33:00.411 --> 00:33:05.873
through trickery."
So far he's never had to pay

00:33:05.873 --> 00:33:08.881
out.
Well again, that doesn't prove

00:33:08.881 --> 00:33:12.611
the dualist is wrong.
It could be that there are

00:33:12.611 --> 00:33:15.851
genuine séances.
It could be that there really

00:33:15.851 --> 00:33:18.003
are ghosts.
It could be that there really

00:33:18.003 --> 00:33:19.520
is communication from the dead.

00:33:22.529 --> 00:33:26.830
As is typically the case,
you've got to decide for

00:33:26.830 --> 00:33:31.569
yourself what strikes you as the
better explanation.

00:33:31.569 --> 00:33:36.181
Is the supernatural,
dualist explanation the more

00:33:36.181 --> 00:33:39.506
likely one?
Or is the physicalist

00:33:39.506 --> 00:33:45.928
explanation the more likely one?
Look, you have a dream where

00:33:45.928 --> 00:33:51.230
your dead mother has come back
to talk to you.

00:33:51.230 --> 00:33:53.984
One possible explanation,
the dualist,

00:33:53.984 --> 00:33:58.152
that's the ghost of your
mother, immaterial soul that she

00:33:58.152 --> 00:34:01.799
is, communicating to you while
you're asleep.

00:34:01.799 --> 00:34:06.180
Second possible explanation,
it's just a dream.

00:34:06.180 --> 00:34:10.303
Of course you dream about your
mother because your unconscious

00:34:10.303 --> 00:34:14.380
cares about her.
What's the better explanation?

00:34:14.380 --> 00:34:18.685
We don't have the time here to
go case, by case,

00:34:18.685 --> 00:34:23.632
by case, and ask ourselves,
"How does the evidence fall

00:34:23.632 --> 00:34:30.462
down one side versus the other?"
But when I review the evidence,

00:34:30.462 --> 00:34:37.412
I come away thinking there's no
good reason to move beyond the

00:34:37.412 --> 00:34:40.989
physical.
So again, let's recap.

00:34:40.989 --> 00:34:45.979
One group of arguments for the
existence of a soul says,

00:34:45.979 --> 00:34:51.150
"We need to posit a soul in
order to explain something,

00:34:51.150 --> 00:34:54.160
whether it's something everyday
or something supernatural."

00:34:57.489 --> 00:35:03.871
The existence of a soul would
be the beginnings of a possible

00:35:03.871 --> 00:35:07.023
explanation.
But the question is never,

00:35:07.023 --> 00:35:09.199
"Is that a possible
explanation?"

00:35:09.199 --> 00:35:13.179
but, "Is it the best
explanation?"

00:35:13.179 --> 00:35:18.819
And when I review these various
arguments, I come away thinking

00:35:18.819 --> 00:35:23.550
the better explanation falls
with the physicalist.

00:35:23.550 --> 00:35:29.828
Mind you, I don't want to deny
that there are some things the

00:35:29.828 --> 00:35:35.270
physicalist has not yet done a
very compelling job of

00:35:35.270 --> 00:35:37.731
explaining.
In particular,

00:35:37.731 --> 00:35:41.553
as I've mentioned previously,
I think there are mysteries and

00:35:41.553 --> 00:35:44.420
puzzles about the nature of
consciousness,

00:35:44.420 --> 00:35:49.258
the qualitative aspect of
experience, what it's like to

00:35:49.258 --> 00:35:53.289
smell coffee or taste pineapple
or see red.

00:35:53.289 --> 00:35:57.551
It's very hard to see how you
explain that in physicalist

00:35:57.551 --> 00:36:00.235
terms.
So to that extent,

00:36:00.235 --> 00:36:05.539
I think we can say the jury may
still be out.

00:36:05.539 --> 00:36:09.103
But I don't think what we
should say is,

00:36:09.103 --> 00:36:13.579
"The better explanation lies
with the dualist."

00:36:13.579 --> 00:36:19.070
Because I think positing a soul
doesn't really yet offer us the

00:36:19.070 --> 00:36:22.907
explanation.
It just holds out the promise

00:36:22.907 --> 00:36:26.102
of an explanation.
So at best that's a tie,

00:36:26.102 --> 00:36:29.772
and hence, no compelling reason
to accept the existence of a

00:36:29.772 --> 00:36:30.270
soul.

00:36:34.039 --> 00:36:40.051
It would be one thing if we
could see that no conceivable

00:36:40.051 --> 00:36:44.989
physicalist explanation could
possibly work.

00:36:44.989 --> 00:36:48.610
But I don't think we're in that
situation.

00:36:48.610 --> 00:36:52.216
All we're in right now is,
perhaps in existence of that

00:36:52.216 --> 00:36:55.755
with regard to consciousness,
maybe some other things,

00:36:55.755 --> 00:36:58.360
we don't yet see how to explain
it.

00:36:58.360 --> 00:37:03.343
But not yet seeing how to
explain it is not the same thing

00:37:03.343 --> 00:37:08.590
as seeing that it can't be
explained on physicalist terms.

00:37:08.590 --> 00:37:11.693
Of course, again,
if we had a dualist explanation

00:37:11.693 --> 00:37:15.509
with some details really worked
out, maybe we'd have to say,

00:37:15.509 --> 00:37:18.289
"Look, this is the better
explanation."

00:37:18.289 --> 00:37:22.588
But dualism doesn't so much
offer the explanation typically

00:37:22.588 --> 00:37:25.775
as just say, "Well,
maybe we'd be better off

00:37:25.775 --> 00:37:29.507
positing something immaterial."
That, I think,

00:37:29.507 --> 00:37:32.350
is not a very compelling
argument.

00:37:32.350 --> 00:37:35.988
Well, let's ask.
What other kinds of arguments

00:37:35.988 --> 00:37:39.079
could be offered for the
existence of a soul?

00:37:39.079 --> 00:37:42.143
I want to emphasize the point
that the various arguments that

00:37:42.143 --> 00:37:43.929
I have been talking about so
far,

00:37:43.929 --> 00:37:47.863
although they have this common
strand--"inference to the best

00:37:47.863 --> 00:37:51.599
explanation"--are each separate
and distinct arguments.

00:37:51.599 --> 00:37:54.893
One of them might work even
though the other ones don't

00:37:54.893 --> 00:37:57.035
work.
But I want to turn now to a

00:37:57.035 --> 00:37:59.260
rather different kind of
argument.

00:37:59.260 --> 00:38:04.576
The argument I'm about to
sketch is a purely philosophical

00:38:04.576 --> 00:38:10.173
argument, not really so much a
matter of who can explain this

00:38:10.173 --> 00:38:14.929
or that feature of us better
than anybody else.

00:38:14.929 --> 00:38:19.355
It's an argument that doesn't
seem to have any empirical

00:38:19.355 --> 00:38:22.654
premises;
it works from purely armchair

00:38:22.654 --> 00:38:26.320
philosophical reflection.
And the striking thing is that

00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:28.920
many people find this a pretty
compelling argument.

00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:35.316
The argument I'm going to give
traces back to Descartes,

00:38:35.316 --> 00:38:39.619
the great early modern
philosopher.

00:38:39.619 --> 00:38:42.048
Well, I'm not going to follow
the details of this argument,

00:38:42.048 --> 00:38:43.889
but the basic idea goes back to
Descartes.

00:38:43.889 --> 00:38:49.480
And it starts by asking you to
imagine a story.

00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:51.610
So I'm going to tell the story
in the first person.

00:38:51.610 --> 00:38:54.255
I'm going to tell about myself,
but you know,

00:38:54.255 --> 00:38:56.360
you'll find the argument sort
of,

00:38:56.360 --> 00:38:59.328
perhaps more persuasive if,
as I tell the story,

00:38:59.328 --> 00:39:02.170
you imagine the story being
told about you.

00:39:02.170 --> 00:39:04.656
So each one of you should
translate this into a story

00:39:04.656 --> 00:39:06.920
about yourself.
You know, your morning.

00:39:06.920 --> 00:39:08.539
So this is a story about my
morning.

00:39:08.539 --> 00:39:11.437
Imagine--this didn't,
of course, actually happen,

00:39:11.437 --> 00:39:14.817
but imagine--the crucial point
here is simply that we can

00:39:14.817 --> 00:39:18.658
imagine this story happening,
not even that we think it's

00:39:18.658 --> 00:39:21.602
empirically possible,
just it's conceivable,

00:39:21.602 --> 00:39:23.889
it's an imaginable story.
All right.

00:39:23.889 --> 00:39:29.513
So suppose that I woke up this
morning, that is to say,

00:39:29.513 --> 00:39:35.032
at a certain point I look
around my room and I see the

00:39:35.032 --> 00:39:39.510
familiar sights of my darkened
bedroom.

00:39:39.510 --> 00:39:43.697
I hear, perhaps,
the sounds of the cars outside

00:39:43.697 --> 00:39:48.250
my house, my alarm clock
ringing, what have you.

00:39:48.250 --> 00:39:51.308
I move out of the room toward
the bathroom,

00:39:51.308 --> 00:39:55.592
planning to brush my teeth.
As I enter the bathroom,

00:39:55.592 --> 00:39:59.304
it's much more light,
I look in the mirror

00:39:59.304 --> 00:40:04.102
and--here's where things get
really weird--I don't see

00:40:04.102 --> 00:40:06.851
anything.
Normally, of course,

00:40:06.851 --> 00:40:09.890
when I look in the mirror I see
my face.

00:40:09.890 --> 00:40:12.511
I see my head;
I see the reflection of my

00:40:12.511 --> 00:40:14.522
torso.
But now, as I'm looking into

00:40:14.522 --> 00:40:16.780
the mirror, I don't see anything
at all.

00:40:16.780 --> 00:40:21.070
Instead, I see the shower
reflected behind me.

00:40:21.070 --> 00:40:23.960
Normally, that's blocked of
course by me,

00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:26.889
by my body.
But I don't see my body.

00:40:26.889 --> 00:40:30.560
Slightly freaked out,
I reach for my head,

00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:35.574
or perhaps we should say I
reach for where I would expect

00:40:35.574 --> 00:40:39.065
my head to be,
but I don't feel anything

00:40:39.065 --> 00:40:43.437
there.
Glancing down at my arms,

00:40:43.437 --> 00:40:49.230
I don't see any arms.
Now, I'm really panicking.

00:40:49.230 --> 00:40:53.650
As I begin trying to touch my
body, I don't feel anything.

00:40:53.650 --> 00:40:57.500
I don't--Not only can't I feel
anything with my fingers,

00:40:57.500 --> 00:41:01.280
I don't have any sensations
where my body should be.

00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:05.411
Now, we could continue this
story, but I've probably said

00:41:05.411 --> 00:41:09.765
enough for you to grant that
what I've just started doing--a

00:41:09.765 --> 00:41:14.339
novelist could do a better job
of telling the story than I just

00:41:14.339 --> 00:41:19.061
did--but what I've just done was
basically imagine--I've imagined

00:41:19.061 --> 00:41:23.710
a story in which I discover that
my body doesn't exist.

00:41:23.710 --> 00:41:27.906
Or I've imagined a story in
which my body has perhaps ceased

00:41:27.906 --> 00:41:31.534
to exist, or I've imagined a
story in which I exist,

00:41:31.534 --> 00:41:35.813
or at least my mind exists.
You know, I'm thinking thoughts

00:41:35.813 --> 00:41:38.890
like, "Why can't I see my body
in the mirror?

00:41:38.890 --> 00:41:42.390
Why can't I feel my head?
What's going on?"

00:41:42.390 --> 00:41:46.399
I'm panicking, right?
We've got a story in which I'm

00:41:46.399 --> 00:41:51.894
thinking all sorts of thoughts;
my mind clearly exists,

00:41:51.894 --> 00:41:56.889
and yet, for all that,
my body does not exist.

00:41:56.889 --> 00:42:02.860
We could--certainly it
seems--imagine that possibility.

00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:08.111
Now, the brilliant thing about
this argument is it goes from

00:42:08.111 --> 00:42:13.540
that to a conclusion about there
being a difference between my

00:42:13.540 --> 00:42:17.875
mind and my body.
What we've just done,

00:42:17.875 --> 00:42:24.568
after all, is imagine that my
mind exists but my body does

00:42:24.568 --> 00:42:27.039
not.
Now, what does that show?

00:42:27.039 --> 00:42:36.992
Descartes says what it shows is
the mind and the body must be

00:42:36.992 --> 00:42:46.369
two logically distinct things.
The mind and the body cannot be

00:42:46.369 --> 00:42:50.843
the same thing.
Because, after all,

00:42:50.843 --> 00:42:58.590
what I just did was imagine my
mind existing without my body.

00:42:58.590 --> 00:43:02.489
How could I even do that,
even in imagination?

00:43:02.489 --> 00:43:08.066
How could it even be possible
to imagine my mind without my

00:43:08.066 --> 00:43:13.836
body, if talking about my mind
is just a way of talking about

00:43:13.836 --> 00:43:16.528
my body?
If they're really,

00:43:16.528 --> 00:43:19.605
bottom line,
metaphysically speaking,

00:43:19.605 --> 00:43:23.109
the same thing,
then you couldn't have one

00:43:23.109 --> 00:43:31.730
without the other after all.
So here's a podium.

00:43:31.730 --> 00:43:37.557
Try to tell a story in which
this podium exists but this

00:43:37.557 --> 00:43:42.449
podium does not exist.
You can't do it, right?

00:43:42.449 --> 00:43:45.380
The podium is just one thing,
the podium.

00:43:45.380 --> 00:43:48.338
And if it is just one thing,
you could tell a story in which

00:43:48.338 --> 00:43:50.407
it exists;
you could tell a story in which

00:43:50.407 --> 00:43:53.947
it doesn't exist.
But you can't tell a story in

00:43:53.947 --> 00:43:57.190
which it exists and doesn't
exist.

00:43:57.190 --> 00:44:05.683
If I can tell a story in which
A exists and B doesn't exist,

00:44:05.683 --> 00:44:13.889
it's got to follow that A and B
are not the same thing.

00:44:13.889 --> 00:44:19.594
Because if B was just another
word for, another way of talking

00:44:19.594 --> 00:44:24.645
about, A, then to imagine A
existing but B not existing

00:44:24.645 --> 00:44:28.760
would be imagining A existing
but--well,

00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:33.791
B is just A--A not existing.
But of course,

00:44:33.791 --> 00:44:40.156
you can't imagine a world in
which A exists but A doesn't

00:44:40.156 --> 00:44:44.641
exist.
Put the same point the other

00:44:44.641 --> 00:44:52.183
way around: If I can imagine A
without B, then A and B have to

00:44:52.183 --> 00:44:58.170
be logically distinct things.
They cannot be identical.

00:45:01.559 --> 00:45:09.647
But since I can imagine my mind
existing without my body,

00:45:09.647 --> 00:45:17.591
it follows that my mind and my
body have to be logically

00:45:17.591 --> 00:45:24.010
distinct things.
They cannot be identical.

00:45:24.010 --> 00:45:28.159
My mind cannot just be a way of
talking.

00:45:28.159 --> 00:45:34.156
Talking about my mind cannot
just be a way of talking about

00:45:34.156 --> 00:45:40.250
my body.
Now, it's a very cool argument.

00:45:40.250 --> 00:45:42.059
You know, philosophers love
this argument.

00:45:42.059 --> 00:45:46.716
And I've got to tell you,
to this day there's a debate in

00:45:46.716 --> 00:45:51.040
the philosophical community
about whether or not this

00:45:51.040 --> 00:45:52.620
argument works.

00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:03.514
It's one thing to be clear--a
couple of things to be clear

00:46:03.514 --> 00:46:07.232
about.
What exactly is this argument

00:46:07.232 --> 00:46:10.849
not doing?
The argument is not saying,

00:46:10.849 --> 00:46:14.851
"If something is possible,
if I can imagine it,

00:46:14.851 --> 00:46:16.560
it's true."
No.

00:46:16.560 --> 00:46:20.990
I can imagine unicorns.
It doesn't mean unicorns exist.

00:46:24.500 --> 00:46:26.719
That's not what the argument is
saying.

00:46:26.719 --> 00:46:32.409
The argument is only making a
much more specific claim.

00:46:32.409 --> 00:46:36.152
If I can imagine one thing
without the other,

00:46:36.152 --> 00:46:39.773
they must be separate things.
Now, of course,

00:46:39.773 --> 00:46:43.709
it could still be that in the
real world the one thing cannot

00:46:43.709 --> 00:46:46.985
exist without the other.
There may be some sort of

00:46:46.985 --> 00:46:50.598
metaphysical laws that tie the
two things so tightly together

00:46:50.598 --> 00:46:53.970
that you'll never actually get
one without the other.

00:46:53.970 --> 00:46:58.645
That's not the question.
The point is just if I can at

00:46:58.645 --> 00:47:03.062
least imagine the one thing
without the other,

00:47:03.062 --> 00:47:07.380
they must in fact be two
separate things.

00:47:07.380 --> 00:47:11.253
Because if there was really
just one thing there,

00:47:11.253 --> 00:47:14.239
you couldn't imagine it without
it.

00:47:14.239 --> 00:47:19.161
Since I can imagine my mind
without my body,

00:47:19.161 --> 00:47:25.684
it must be the case that my
mind is something separate and

00:47:25.684 --> 00:47:31.155
distinct from my body.
Otherwise, how could I imagine

00:47:31.155 --> 00:47:35.196
it existing without the body?
If they were the same thing,

00:47:35.196 --> 00:47:38.730
I couldn't--I can't imagine the
body existing without the body.

00:47:38.730 --> 00:47:41.614
If the mind is just a way of
talking about the body,

00:47:41.614 --> 00:47:44.329
how could I imagine the mind
without the body?

00:47:44.329 --> 00:47:47.986
Since I can imagine the mind
without the body,

00:47:47.986 --> 00:47:50.829
it follows that they're
separate.

00:47:50.829 --> 00:47:53.320
So the mind is not the body
after all.

00:47:53.320 --> 00:47:56.550
It's something different.
It's the soul.

00:47:56.550 --> 00:48:01.586
Is that a good argument or not?
That's where we'll start next

00:48:01.586 --> 00:48:02.586
time.

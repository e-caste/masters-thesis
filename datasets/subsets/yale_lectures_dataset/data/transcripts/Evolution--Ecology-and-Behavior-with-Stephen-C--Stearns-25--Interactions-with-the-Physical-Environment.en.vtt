00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:06.565
Prof: Last time I
discussed the planet as a

00:00:06.565 --> 00:00:10.370
basically physical and chemical
machine,

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:13.604
and how climate affects
temperature and water and

00:00:13.604 --> 00:00:16.300
nutrient relationships on the
planet,

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:20.660
both on the continents and in
the ocean.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:26.046
And what that does is it
creates a mosaic of ecological

00:00:26.046 --> 00:00:28.540
problems for organisms.
 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:32.237
And the part of ecology that
looks at how organisms

00:00:32.237 --> 00:00:35.712
individually deal with the
problems posed by the

00:00:35.712 --> 00:00:38.958
environment,
things like temperature and pH

00:00:38.958 --> 00:00:41.940
and water availability and stuff
like that,

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.360
is called physiological ecology.
 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.406
And I'm going to give you a
brief description of that today,

00:00:49.406 --> 00:00:53.384
using a historical framework,
which is up here on the first

00:00:53.384 --> 00:00:54.070
slide.
 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.611
Now the purpose of this
historical framework is to show

00:00:58.611 --> 00:01:03.908
you that between about 1860 and
about 1960 people conceptualized

00:01:03.908 --> 00:01:08.701
both the way the organisms deal
with these problems in the

00:01:08.701 --> 00:01:12.417
environment,
and then how to integrate that

00:01:12.417 --> 00:01:16.510
into a comprehensive vision of
where organisms can live,

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:18.980
and why that is the case.
 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.927
And that vision of where
organisms can live and

00:01:21.927 --> 00:01:24.388
reproduce,
survive and reproduce,

00:01:24.388 --> 00:01:28.302
the ecological niche idea,
is something that turned into

00:01:28.302 --> 00:01:32.179
an intellectual tool that became
very useful in many different

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:33.450
parts of ecology.
 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.953
So what we're doing here is
starting off with Claude

00:01:36.953 --> 00:01:39.268
Bernard,
the great French physiologist

00:01:39.268 --> 00:01:42.599
who came up with the idea that
one of the basic things going on

00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:45.554
in organisms is that they're
trying to keep their inside

00:01:45.554 --> 00:01:48.790
constant,
while the outside changes;

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.390
the idea of homeostasis,
la constance du milieu

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.080
intÃ©rieur.
 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.992
And well then I'll briefly
mention L.J. Henderson,

00:01:58.992 --> 00:02:04.301
who said, "You know,
it's extremely interesting that

00:02:04.301 --> 00:02:08.460
the properties of important
things in the environment,

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:11.752
like water and air and the
molecules out of which organisms

00:02:11.752 --> 00:02:14.182
are built,
and things like that,

00:02:14.182 --> 00:02:18.620
are in some cases extremely
convenient for life."

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.050
He called that the fitness of
the environment.

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.889
So he kind of turned the whole
idea of evolutionary fitness

00:02:23.889 --> 00:02:25.289
around,
and he said,

00:02:25.289 --> 00:02:29.310
"The environment appears
to be peculiarly fit,

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.078
as a place for organisms,
like the ones that we know,

00:02:32.078 --> 00:02:33.090
to live in."
 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.312
And, of course,
that's not too surprising,

00:02:35.312 --> 00:02:38.240
given that this is the planet
on which life evolved.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.268
Nevertheless,
it's worth considering the fact

00:02:41.268 --> 00:02:45.259
that water has some completely
extraordinary properties.

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:47.628
It has very high heat capacity.
 

00:02:47.628 --> 00:02:52.644
It transfers heat very rapidly,
and water can put into solution

00:02:52.644 --> 00:02:57.740
probably more different kinds of
atoms and molecules than almost

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:59.520
any other solvent.
 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.816
So on a planetary scale,
water serves very effectively

00:03:03.816 --> 00:03:09.002
as a heat transfer mechanism;
what we saw in the lecture last

00:03:09.002 --> 00:03:09.520
time.
 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:14.270
It serves very effectively as a
medium in which a huge diversity

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:18.490
of chemical reactions can occur,
out of which life has selected

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:20.960
some of them,
and so forth.

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.318
And you can carry this kind of
thinking on, into other parts of

00:03:24.318 --> 00:03:24.860
biology.
 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:28.265
For example,
why is it that phosphorus was

00:03:28.265 --> 00:03:33.169
the element that was selected to
be the medium of biological

00:03:33.169 --> 00:03:36.410
energy transfer in the form of
ATP?

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:40.434
And if you look into the shell
structure of the phosphorous

00:03:40.434 --> 00:03:42.684
atom,
you will find that it actually

00:03:42.684 --> 00:03:44.830
has some options for storing
energy,

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:49.360
and then forming bonds with
oxygen,

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:54.488
that help us to understand why
it was phosphorous that was the

00:03:54.488 --> 00:03:59.197
one that life selected for the
generalized unit of energy

00:03:59.197 --> 00:04:00.288
currency.
 

00:04:00.288 --> 00:04:02.883
So L.J. Henderson's ideas
actually are kind of provocative

00:04:02.883 --> 00:04:04.507
and interesting,
and the book,

00:04:04.507 --> 00:04:06.560
The Fitness of the
Environment,

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:07.968
is well written and a pleasure
to read.

00:04:07.968 --> 00:04:10.647
So if you get interested in
that--and by the way,

00:04:10.647 --> 00:04:13.325
Claude Bernard's book,
A Study of Experimental

00:04:13.325 --> 00:04:16.060
Medicine,
is easily available in English.

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.759
These people are very bright
people who wrote some classics,

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:22.579
and it's nice to be able,
as a scholar,

00:04:22.579 --> 00:04:26.410
to tap into that history of the
development of ideas.

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:30.649
Now the culmination of this,
at least for today's purposes,

00:04:30.649 --> 00:04:34.547
was Evelyn Hutchinson's
concluding remarks at the Cold

00:04:34.547 --> 00:04:38.149
Spring Harbor Symposium on Long
Island in 1959.

00:04:38.149 --> 00:04:41.194
That was the output of his
graduate seminar here in this

00:04:41.194 --> 00:04:45.791
department where he had--
in his graduate seminar at that

00:04:45.791 --> 00:04:51.798
time he had people like Larry
Slobodkin and Bob MacArthur and

00:04:51.798 --> 00:04:53.100
Alan Kohn.
 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:56.879
So there was kind of a dynamic
group of grad students in the

00:04:56.879 --> 00:05:00.233
Yale Biology Department,
studying ecology at that time,

00:05:00.233 --> 00:05:02.867
and they had come up,
together with Hutchinson,

00:05:02.867 --> 00:05:06.310
with this idea of the niche as
an N-dimensional hyper-volume.

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:10.043
And that was a very powerful
tool for condensing all of these

00:05:10.043 --> 00:05:13.466
ideas about how individual
organisms and populations are

00:05:13.466 --> 00:05:17.139
dealing with their physical and
chemical environments,

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:21.189
and representing it as an
object that then could be used

00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:22.810
further in analysis.
 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:24.720
So that's the framework.
 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.848
These are the guys,
Bernard, Henderson and

00:05:27.848 --> 00:05:28.839
Hutchinson.
 

00:05:28.839 --> 00:05:30.874
There's a portrait of
Hutchinson in the Saybrook

00:05:30.874 --> 00:05:31.480
Dining Hall.
 

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.120
I actually think the photo's a
little bit better.

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:37.379
This is a bush baby;
that's a Galago.

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:39.690
I wouldn't mind having one of
those.

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:42.654
And the outline of the lecture
is going to be a bit about

00:05:42.654 --> 00:05:44.930
temperature and about thermal
regulation.

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:48.165
So the basic idea here is that
ectotherms and endotherms have

00:05:48.165 --> 00:05:50.970
really quite different problems
with temperature,

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:53.310
and they deal with it in quite
different ways.

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:55.851
In homeotherms,
we're going to look at

00:05:55.851 --> 00:06:00.180
metabolic rate and brown fat and
hibernation, and why it is that

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:02.930
intermediate sized things
hibernate.

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:06.644
The really little ones can't
and the really big ones can't,

00:06:06.644 --> 00:06:08.759
but the ones in the middle can.
 

00:06:08.759 --> 00:06:11.800
We'll take a bit of a look at
temperature and evaporative

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:13.978
water loss,
and then I want to talk a bit

00:06:13.978 --> 00:06:16.572
about how plants deal with
drought and with too little

00:06:16.572 --> 00:06:19.043
water and oxygen,
and then we'll end up with the

00:06:19.043 --> 00:06:19.910
ecological niche.
 

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:23.235
This is a very,
very quick and kind of spotty

00:06:23.235 --> 00:06:27.470
summary of some major themes in
physiological ecology.

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:30.783
It's a big field,
and it contains a lot of neat

00:06:30.783 --> 00:06:35.107
experiments, and I'm only able
to touch on it quickly in this

00:06:35.107 --> 00:06:35.899
course.
 

00:06:35.899 --> 00:06:38.339
One of the themes that I want
to bring up now--

00:06:38.339 --> 00:06:42.716
and I hope I remember to come
back and mention it again later

00:06:42.716 --> 00:06:46.314
in the lecture--
is that we will see that

00:06:46.314 --> 00:06:51.454
organisms have lots of
adaptations for dealing with the

00:06:51.454 --> 00:06:53.740
external environment.
 

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:56.432
We'll see it in the nose and
the brain of the oryx,

00:06:56.432 --> 00:06:59.663
and we'll see it in the special
organs of plants to deal with

00:06:59.663 --> 00:07:01.439
oxygen problems and so forth.
 

00:07:01.439 --> 00:07:05.733
And one way to think about that
is that evolution has designed

00:07:05.733 --> 00:07:10.098
organisms to extend the range of
environments in which they can

00:07:10.098 --> 00:07:13.271
survive and reproduce,
and therefore that the

00:07:13.271 --> 00:07:16.567
definition of what is critical
in the environment has been

00:07:16.567 --> 00:07:18.649
continually changed by
evolution.

00:07:18.649 --> 00:07:19.790
It's been a moving target.
 

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:23.266
You cannot think of an
ecological niche as being

00:07:23.266 --> 00:07:27.704
something that pre-existed on
the planet, before life started

00:07:27.704 --> 00:07:28.740
to evolve.
 

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:32.550
But we now use,
as a tool in ecology,

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:36.410
the concept of the ecological
nice as an artificial construct,

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:39.766
invented by human minds,
as an intellectual tool to try

00:07:39.766 --> 00:07:42.750
to make sense out of the
complexity of nature.

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:45.867
And our definition of it
actually is the product of

00:07:45.867 --> 00:07:48.550
evolution, and it's been a
moving target.

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:51.781
So don't think of the
environment as consisting of a

00:07:51.781 --> 00:07:55.584
pre-existing chessboard on one
of which- each square of which

00:07:55.584 --> 00:07:58.028
is a niche,
and into which you can put an

00:07:58.028 --> 00:08:00.367
organism,
and then it will all get filled

00:08:00.367 --> 00:08:00.600
up.
 

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:03.882
Because the organisms
themselves have been defining

00:08:03.882 --> 00:08:06.509
what these things are,
as they evolve.

00:08:06.509 --> 00:08:10.160
Okay, a little bit about
ectotherms and endotherms.

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:12.466
Here's, on the X-axis,
we've got environmental

00:08:12.466 --> 00:08:15.028
temperature, outside
temperature, in Centigrade;

00:08:15.028 --> 00:08:17.290
and here we have body
temperature.

00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:21.242
And a mouse is maintaining its
temperature at a nice 37,

00:08:21.242 --> 00:08:25.483
and the lizard is letting its
temperature fluctuate with the

00:08:25.483 --> 00:08:27.278
external environment.
 

00:08:27.278 --> 00:08:29.509
We'll see that actually lizards
can control this,

00:08:29.509 --> 00:08:31.007
to some extent,
behaviorally,

00:08:31.007 --> 00:08:33.692
and that things like mice,
of course, do have daily

00:08:33.692 --> 00:08:35.250
temperature cycles and so forth.
 

00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:37.921
But just at this level--and
it's a very rough

00:08:37.921 --> 00:08:41.442
contrast--endotherms maintain
constant internal temperature

00:08:41.442 --> 00:08:43.629
and ectotherms let it fluctuate.
 

00:08:43.629 --> 00:08:47.697
Now lizards have a preferred
temperature, and actually their

00:08:47.697 --> 00:08:51.490
preferred temperature is a bit
hotter than the mouse.

00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:57.130
They like it to be oh about
30--well maybe not quite as hot

00:08:57.130 --> 00:09:00.631
as the mouse,
but they like it in the

00:09:00.631 --> 00:09:05.793
mid-30s;
so say around somewhere between

00:09:05.793 --> 00:09:10.558
90 and 95 Fahrenheit,
say 88 and 95.

00:09:10.558 --> 00:09:13.812
And their surroundings have a
huge temperature range,

00:09:13.812 --> 00:09:17.250
and the actual temperature
range--this is what you would

00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:18.690
measure in the lab.
 

00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:19.840
If you made a temperature
gradient,

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:22.886
and you put your lizard in and
you let it just settle down in

00:09:22.886 --> 00:09:25.341
the temperature gradient,
it would wander back and forth

00:09:25.341 --> 00:09:28.403
until it found what it liked,
and it would settle down right

00:09:28.403 --> 00:09:28.870
there.
 

00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:32.947
Its actual temperature in
nature is much narrower than the

00:09:32.947 --> 00:09:36.740
range of temperatures out there
in the environment.

00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:40.191
And, for example,
it can do things like having

00:09:40.191 --> 00:09:44.715
its back facing east or its back
facing west, depending upon

00:09:44.715 --> 00:09:47.629
whether it's morning or
afternoon.

00:09:47.629 --> 00:09:50.422
Right at noon,
when the sun's directly

00:09:50.422 --> 00:09:53.288
overhead, it won't orient like
that.

00:09:53.288 --> 00:09:57.720
So if the lizards are basking,
they bask in such a way that

00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:02.302
helps them to maintain their
actual temperature above that of

00:10:02.302 --> 00:10:04.899
the environment,
in this case.

00:10:04.899 --> 00:10:08.758
They manage to be warm when
they need to run fast,

00:10:08.758 --> 00:10:11.750
and they manage to be cool at
night.

00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:14.870
If you're a herpetologist and
you like to catch lizards,

00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:18.120
you know that a lizard that's
been sitting on a nice warm rock

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:21.267
is going to run away from you
really quickly when you try to

00:10:21.267 --> 00:10:22.440
go up and grab it.
 

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:24.979
And, of course,
they have developed this

00:10:24.979 --> 00:10:28.038
because they need to get away
from predators.

00:10:28.038 --> 00:10:30.897
So they will bask in the
morning, to get their

00:10:30.897 --> 00:10:33.453
temperature up,
and then they will move back

00:10:33.453 --> 00:10:35.928
and forth between sun and shade
during the day,

00:10:35.928 --> 00:10:38.190
to maintain their body
temperature,

00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:41.085
in the high 30s,
and then they go back into

00:10:41.085 --> 00:10:42.740
their burrow at night.
 

00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:46.797
So there is a kind of
behavioral thermoregulation in

00:10:46.797 --> 00:10:49.740
this ectotherm,
which is not doing its

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:53.399
thermoregulation with internal
physiology;

00:10:53.399 --> 00:10:58.678
it's doing it by moving in and
out of sun and shade.

00:10:58.678 --> 00:11:02.840
Another very important idea for
ectotherms,

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:07.139
and particularly for small
ones--the smaller you are,

00:11:07.139 --> 00:11:10.889
because of the surface area
volume ratio,

00:11:10.889 --> 00:11:12.860
the more rapidly you take up or
lose heat.

00:11:16.299 --> 00:11:18.418
This idea is physiological time.
 

00:11:18.418 --> 00:11:18.696
Okay?
 

00:11:18.696 --> 00:11:21.400
So physiological time is
something which is really

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:23.610
directly proportional to
temperature;

00:11:23.610 --> 00:11:26.798
and you can see an illustration
of it over here.

00:11:26.798 --> 00:11:30.635
This is the percentage of
development that's going on in

00:11:30.635 --> 00:11:32.308
the course of one day.
 

00:11:32.308 --> 00:11:36.176
So in 24 hours this is how much
development is occurring in

00:11:36.176 --> 00:11:39.509
standardized stages,
depending upon temperature.

00:11:39.509 --> 00:11:42.678
And if you transform that into
a rate per day and plot it

00:11:42.678 --> 00:11:46.250
against temperature,
you get this nice straight

00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:51.840
line, which basically means that
time is directly proportional to

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:53.149
temperature.
 

00:11:53.149 --> 00:11:55.889
So the hotter it is,
the faster they'll develop.

00:11:55.889 --> 00:11:59.038
And what that means is kind of
interesting for ecology,

00:11:59.038 --> 00:12:01.168
because on the one hand you've
got a lot of predators who are

00:12:01.168 --> 00:12:03.952
homeotherms,
and who don't have this kind of

00:12:03.952 --> 00:12:05.190
reaction at all.
 

00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:06.690
So they're running around
rapidly.

00:12:06.690 --> 00:12:10.505
Shrews, mice, birds;
lots of things that will eat

00:12:10.505 --> 00:12:14.227
insects are fairly insensitive
to the external temperature,

00:12:14.227 --> 00:12:17.178
and they can be active at all
temperatures.

00:12:17.178 --> 00:12:19.360
Whereas the insects are
actually forced,

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:24.080
by their small size and their
ectotherm status,

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:25.928
to grow more slowly when it's
cold,

00:12:25.928 --> 00:12:28.408
and they're forced to grow more
rapidly when it's hot.

00:12:28.408 --> 00:12:31.630
And that has cascading effects
on their population dynamics and

00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:33.450
on their predator/prey
relations.

00:12:37.308 --> 00:12:41.524
Now what about endotherms,
how do they deal with the

00:12:41.524 --> 00:12:43.840
environmental temperature?
 

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:47.616
Well this is the body
temperature of a model

00:12:47.616 --> 00:12:52.009
endotherm, and this is its heat
production here.

00:12:52.009 --> 00:12:55.937
Now what's going on is that
there is an upper critical

00:12:55.937 --> 00:12:58.868
temperature,
and if the environmental

00:12:58.868 --> 00:13:01.081
temperature,
in the long-term,

00:13:01.081 --> 00:13:04.129
goes above this upper critical
temperature,

00:13:04.129 --> 00:13:07.899
the endotherm can no longer
thermoregulate,

00:13:07.899 --> 00:13:09.860
and its body temperature will
rise.

00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:12.928
If I take you out into the
Sahara,

00:13:12.928 --> 00:13:14.799
on a hot day,
and I sit you down,

00:13:14.799 --> 00:13:17.490
you're going to thermoregulate
pretty well,

00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:21.408
until the external temperature
gets above about a steady 110,

00:13:21.408 --> 00:13:22.820
or something like that,
Fahrenheit,

00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:26.009
and at that point your sweating
and so forth isn't going to

00:13:26.009 --> 00:13:28.893
function anymore,
and your body temperature will

00:13:28.893 --> 00:13:31.332
rise,
and if that goes on very long

00:13:31.332 --> 00:13:32.450
you'll be dead.
 

00:13:32.450 --> 00:13:34.799
So that's what this critical
temperature means.

00:13:34.799 --> 00:13:37.548
Lower critical temperature.
 

00:13:37.548 --> 00:13:42.599
Basically if the environmental
temperature drops below the

00:13:42.599 --> 00:13:47.559
lower critical temperature,
then internal heat production

00:13:47.559 --> 00:13:49.509
starts to ramp up.
 

00:13:49.509 --> 00:13:52.298
That would be both direct
burning of fat,

00:13:52.298 --> 00:13:55.995
down at the cellular level,
and it would be shivering,

00:13:55.995 --> 00:13:57.740
and things like that.
 

00:13:57.740 --> 00:14:02.205
And that would allow you to
maintain a nice steady internal

00:14:02.205 --> 00:14:06.046
temperature,
until you got down to your

00:14:06.046 --> 00:14:10.490
maximum heat output,
by all physiological mechanisms

00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:12.889
combined,
and if the external temperature

00:14:12.889 --> 00:14:16.163
drops even further than that,
and you're no longer able to

00:14:16.163 --> 00:14:19.130
keep up,
you will freeze and die down at

00:14:19.130 --> 00:14:19.899
that end.
 

00:14:19.899 --> 00:14:20.610
Okay?
 

00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:24.293
So you can see that there is a
range of environmental values

00:14:24.293 --> 00:14:27.663
that can be dealt with,
and then outside that range you

00:14:27.663 --> 00:14:29.600
can't deal with it anymore.
 

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:34.200
And this is something that's
evolved, where these points are.

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:38.254
So what's going on here is
variations among different kinds

00:14:38.254 --> 00:14:41.610
of endotherms in their
insulation blood flow,

00:14:41.610 --> 00:14:45.210
how they select microclimates,
shivering and huddling.

00:14:45.210 --> 00:14:46.918
Insulation.
 

00:14:46.918 --> 00:14:51.065
Take a Weddell seal or a
Leopard seal or something like

00:14:51.065 --> 00:14:54.673
that, freeze it,
cut it in half with a band saw,

00:14:54.673 --> 00:14:57.129
look at it in cross-section.
 

00:14:57.129 --> 00:15:00.210
It's about one-third fat,
on the outside.

00:15:00.210 --> 00:15:01.830
It's extremely well insulated.
 

00:15:01.830 --> 00:15:04.658
Same thing for a humpback whale
or a blue whale.

00:15:04.658 --> 00:15:07.129
So insulation can be very
important.

00:15:07.129 --> 00:15:08.429
Bears do it.
 

00:15:08.429 --> 00:15:12.801
We do it;
we have subcutaneous fat that

00:15:12.801 --> 00:15:15.019
serves as an insulator.
 

00:15:15.019 --> 00:15:17.394
Shivering and huddling;
well you know all about

00:15:17.394 --> 00:15:18.009
shivering.
 

00:15:18.009 --> 00:15:20.975
Huddling is something,
for example,

00:15:20.975 --> 00:15:23.678
that the emperor penguins do.
 

00:15:23.678 --> 00:15:27.432
Emperor penguins have this
totally bizarre lifestyle where

00:15:27.432 --> 00:15:31.251
they have chosen to lay their
eggs on part of the Antarctic

00:15:31.251 --> 00:15:34.241
continent,
which is exposed during the

00:15:34.241 --> 00:15:36.596
summer,
but their lifecycle is such

00:15:36.596 --> 00:15:40.345
that it takes them about six
months for the eggs to hatch and

00:15:40.345 --> 00:15:42.220
then to start to feed baby.
 

00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:47.299
And so at the time when they
have these little chicks that

00:15:47.299 --> 00:15:50.856
need lots of warmth,
and they are shuttling back and

00:15:50.856 --> 00:15:53.773
forth to try to go way out to
the edge of the pack ice to get

00:15:53.773 --> 00:15:56.287
squid--
because now it's winter and the

00:15:56.287 --> 00:16:00.274
pack ice is frozen-they huddle
and get into a big circle where

00:16:00.274 --> 00:16:03.480
you'll have hundreds of these
giant penguins--

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:06.058
they're about this big--that
are all packed together.

00:16:06.058 --> 00:16:11.178
And the Antarctic hurricanes
are blowing over them with -40,

00:16:11.178 --> 00:16:14.846
-50 Fahrenheit temperatures,
and the birds are basically

00:16:14.846 --> 00:16:18.712
forming a continually moving
clump in which the ones on the

00:16:18.712 --> 00:16:22.645
outside are getting desperate
and pushing their way into the

00:16:22.645 --> 00:16:24.524
inside,
and the ones on the inside,

00:16:24.524 --> 00:16:26.519
they're a little bit warmer and
not quite so desperate,

00:16:26.519 --> 00:16:28.700
and are getting pushed out to
the outside.

00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:29.779
So that's huddling.
 

00:16:33.490 --> 00:16:37.246
Okay, now let's go inside some
organisms and look at some of

00:16:37.246 --> 00:16:41.131
the adaptations that evolution
has produced that allow them to

00:16:41.131 --> 00:16:43.678
regulate their internal
environment.

00:16:43.678 --> 00:16:47.798
So this is a classic example of
something that would cause the

00:16:47.798 --> 00:16:50.769
internal environment to be held
constant,

00:16:50.769 --> 00:16:54.000
despite great variation in the
external environment:

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.090
countercurrent heat exchangers.
 

00:16:56.090 --> 00:17:06.499
And the way these things work
basically is that if you have

00:17:06.499 --> 00:17:11.442
concurrent flow--
this is the countercurrent

00:17:11.442 --> 00:17:14.568
case, and it's being explained
here by contrast to the

00:17:14.568 --> 00:17:15.690
concurrent case.
 

00:17:15.690 --> 00:17:18.395
In concurrent flow you would
have say venous blood going in

00:17:18.395 --> 00:17:20.528
this direction;
and then running right next to

00:17:20.528 --> 00:17:23.028
the vein you've got an artery,
going in this direction.

00:17:23.028 --> 00:17:28.078
So the artery perhaps is nice
and warm,

00:17:28.078 --> 00:17:30.943
but it's running next to the
vein, and there's an exchange

00:17:30.943 --> 00:17:33.307
gradient along it,
and as these two things

00:17:33.307 --> 00:17:36.093
exchange heat they end up at the
same temperature,

00:17:36.093 --> 00:17:36.890
coming out.
 

00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:40.950
That's what happens if the flow
is going in the same direction.

00:17:40.950 --> 00:17:43.630
But if you arrange it
physiologically,

00:17:43.630 --> 00:17:46.655
and morphologically,
so that the flow in the artery

00:17:46.655 --> 00:17:49.804
is going in the opposite
direction to the flow in the

00:17:49.804 --> 00:17:51.852
vein--
so this is going into the organ

00:17:51.852 --> 00:17:53.618
and this is coming out of the
organ,

00:17:53.618 --> 00:17:56.598
going back to the heart--then
what goes on is that the blood

00:17:56.598 --> 00:17:58.486
that's coming in,
in the artery,

00:17:58.486 --> 00:18:02.115
is getting heated by the blood
that's going back out in the

00:18:02.115 --> 00:18:04.894
vein,
and that's going to maintain

00:18:04.894 --> 00:18:07.269
the temperature on this side.
 

00:18:07.269 --> 00:18:10.703
Now which way you would want to
set this up would depend upon

00:18:10.703 --> 00:18:14.366
whether you wanted the warmth to
be in the core of the body or in

00:18:14.366 --> 00:18:15.970
the outside of the body.
 

00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:18.548
In most cases,
this is in the core of the

00:18:18.548 --> 00:18:19.000
body.
 

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.058
You guys have got this,
right here.

00:18:22.058 --> 00:18:24.660
You can walk in water,
and a countercurrent heat

00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:28.200
exchanger in your legs will make
sure that your body core doesn't

00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:29.858
drop temperature too much.
 

00:18:29.858 --> 00:18:32.067
Yours is okay,
but it's not really nearly as

00:18:32.067 --> 00:18:35.202
impressive as the ones that are
in the feet of ducks and geese

00:18:35.202 --> 00:18:39.942
and moose and things like that;
that can stand around in water,

00:18:39.942 --> 00:18:45.260
which is right at the freezing
point, and their core body

00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:48.869
temperature stays a nice stable
98.

00:18:48.869 --> 00:18:49.250
Okay?
 

00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:55.890
Let me just mention,
before I go into the oryx,

00:18:55.890 --> 00:18:59.115
that there are countercurrent
exchangers that deal with ion

00:18:59.115 --> 00:19:01.338
concentrations in vertebrate
kidneys--

00:19:01.338 --> 00:19:04.210
so the vertebrate kidney is
actually designed using this

00:19:04.210 --> 00:19:06.949
same principle--
and with oxygen concentration

00:19:06.949 --> 00:19:07.880
in fish gills.
 

00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:11.385
So countercurrent exchangers
are something that is obviously

00:19:11.385 --> 00:19:14.653
such a good engineering idea
that it has been arrived at

00:19:14.653 --> 00:19:18.278
convergently by evolution to
deal with similar problems,

00:19:18.278 --> 00:19:22.730
but completely independently
solved.

00:19:22.730 --> 00:19:23.630
Let's take a look at one.
 

00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:27.290
This is the desert oryx--really
a beautiful animal,

00:19:27.290 --> 00:19:31.683
I've seen them in Namibia--and
we're going to look inside its

00:19:31.683 --> 00:19:32.710
head here.
 

00:19:32.710 --> 00:19:38.501
So the problem that the oryx
has is that it needs to regulate

00:19:38.501 --> 00:19:42.750
both its temperature and its
water supply.

00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:44.700
It's living in the desert.
 

00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:52.567
And if you look into its head,
it's got a lot of exposure of

00:19:52.567 --> 00:19:58.568
its blood supply to external air
coming in.

00:19:58.568 --> 00:20:04.130
It doesn't want to lose too
much water by sweating.

00:20:04.130 --> 00:20:07.973
So what it's done is it's
allowed its body temperature to

00:20:07.973 --> 00:20:10.240
go up to 44 degrees Centigrade.
 

00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:13.111
So it won't regulate its body
temperature until it hits 44

00:20:13.111 --> 00:20:14.170
degrees Centigrade.
 

00:20:14.170 --> 00:20:16.910
And it's a big animal,
so overnight it can cool down,

00:20:16.910 --> 00:20:19.808
and it'll take a long time to
hit 44, during the day.

00:20:19.808 --> 00:20:24.838
But its brain would die if it
ever got to 44 Centigrade.

00:20:24.838 --> 00:20:28.971
So it has to figure out a way,
how to hold its brain at a nice

00:20:28.971 --> 00:20:31.574
39 degrees,
while its body temperature,

00:20:31.574 --> 00:20:34.023
which has most of its blood
supply in it,

00:20:34.023 --> 00:20:34.759
is at 44.
 

00:20:34.759 --> 00:20:37.664
So it's got to drop that body
temperature by about 5 degrees

00:20:37.664 --> 00:20:39.338
Centigrade going into the brain.
 

00:20:39.338 --> 00:20:44.900
And the way it does it is it
first takes the blood and it

00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:46.288
gets cooled.
 

00:20:46.288 --> 00:20:47.930
So there's blood that's being
pumped out,

00:20:47.930 --> 00:20:51.680
into its nose--it has a great
big nose--

00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:54.644
blood is getting pumped out
into its nose and coming back

00:20:54.644 --> 00:20:55.808
through these veins.
 

00:20:55.808 --> 00:20:58.936
And this is cold
because--colder--because of the

00:20:58.936 --> 00:21:02.528
evaporative processes that are
going on in the nose.

00:21:02.528 --> 00:21:05.450
It gets passed through what is
called a rete mirabile,

00:21:05.450 --> 00:21:09.038
right here, and the oxygenated
blood,

00:21:09.038 --> 00:21:10.588
which is going to go into the
brain,

00:21:10.588 --> 00:21:13.067
passes through this,
and the cold blood coming out

00:21:13.067 --> 00:21:16.152
of the nose cools the oxygenated
blood off before it gets into

00:21:16.152 --> 00:21:16.858
the brain.
 

00:21:16.858 --> 00:21:21.251
It's really a beautiful
adaptation, and it's something

00:21:21.251 --> 00:21:25.644
that gets repeated in other
organisms to solve similar

00:21:25.644 --> 00:21:28.380
problems in other situations.
 

00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:30.460
For example, tuna.
 

00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:34.942
Here are some yellowfin tuna,
and they have a countercurrent

00:21:34.942 --> 00:21:38.057
heat exchanger,
and they use it to keep cold

00:21:38.057 --> 00:21:41.803
sea water from chilling their
warm venous blood that's coming

00:21:41.803 --> 00:21:44.548
out of their hot high
performance muscle.

00:21:44.548 --> 00:21:51.358
So they cannot really retain
very much heat overall,

00:21:51.358 --> 00:21:53.420
because in order to get oxygen
out of the water,

00:21:53.420 --> 00:21:56.279
they're pumping--and they're
very high energy animals,

00:21:56.279 --> 00:21:58.720
so they're pumping a lot of
oxygen through their gills.

00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:00.509
And that is a big surface.
 

00:22:00.509 --> 00:22:03.186
The water has,
as I mentioned with Henderson,

00:22:03.186 --> 00:22:06.837
very high heat capacity and a
great ability to strip heat off

00:22:06.837 --> 00:22:09.088
of the blood supply in the
gills.

00:22:09.088 --> 00:22:13.700
But down the core of their body
they've got some dark muscle

00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:17.920
that they want to keep up at 37
degrees Centigrade,

00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:22.116
so that they can do things like
swim from San Francisco to Tokyo

00:22:22.116 --> 00:22:25.652
in seven days,
at speeds of up to 50

00:22:25.652 --> 00:22:27.940
kilometers an hour.
 

00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:31.068
These fish are amazing.
 

00:22:31.068 --> 00:22:35.579
Well what they've done--this is
sort of a perch or a largemouth

00:22:35.579 --> 00:22:36.088
bass.
 

00:22:36.088 --> 00:22:40.640
And you might think of that as
the ancestral condition,

00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:42.440
and they've taken this
ancestral condition,

00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:47.670
where the vein,
coming back into the heart,

00:22:47.670 --> 00:22:50.017
looks like that,
and the dorsal aorta going out

00:22:50.017 --> 00:22:54.179
of the heart looks like that,
and that kind of circulation

00:22:54.179 --> 00:22:59.238
has been altered so that you
have a rete mirabile between

00:22:59.238 --> 00:23:05.019
arteries that are running out
under the surface of the skin,

00:23:05.019 --> 00:23:07.750
and veins that are running out
under the surface of the skin.

00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:12.163
And when these arteries are
then pumping through the rete

00:23:12.163 --> 00:23:14.496
mirabile,
into the core of the animal,

00:23:14.496 --> 00:23:17.515
they are picking up heat that's
being generated by that muscle

00:23:17.515 --> 00:23:19.528
tissue,
and then in the countercurrent

00:23:19.528 --> 00:23:21.778
heat exchanger,
or the rete mirabile,

00:23:21.778 --> 00:23:24.960
that heat is exchanged,
going back into the veins.

00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:27.788
So on the external part of the
body the blood's right at

00:23:27.788 --> 00:23:30.772
environmental temperature,
and in the core of the body,

00:23:30.772 --> 00:23:33.865
it is probably maintained at
anywhere from 10 to 20 degrees

00:23:33.865 --> 00:23:36.640
Centigrade above the
environmental temperatures,

00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:38.690
so that these very efficient
muscles can work.

00:23:43.548 --> 00:23:47.400
Mammals maintain their internal
temperature, particularly small

00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:51.065
mammals, maintain their internal
temperature using something

00:23:51.065 --> 00:23:52.368
called brown fat.
 

00:23:52.368 --> 00:23:57.279
So this is now not a
morphological adaptation,

00:23:57.279 --> 00:24:01.367
at the level of an organ--which
is what the rete mirabile or the

00:24:01.367 --> 00:24:03.769
countercurrent heat exchanger
are--

00:24:03.769 --> 00:24:07.588
this is a cellular adaptation.
 

00:24:07.588 --> 00:24:11.953
So if you take a cute little
eastern chipmunk and you look

00:24:11.953 --> 00:24:14.788
into its body,
you find that there are

00:24:14.788 --> 00:24:19.000
specific places where it has
deposits of brown fat.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.869
And this is what brown fat
looks like under a microscope.

00:24:21.869 --> 00:24:23.039
This is white fat.
 

00:24:23.039 --> 00:24:24.009
Okay?
 

00:24:24.009 --> 00:24:27.358
This is what I've got hanging
on my belly.

00:24:27.358 --> 00:24:30.990
And in a brown squirrel,
they have,

00:24:30.990 --> 00:24:33.890
above the kidney and in the
back of the neck and so forth,

00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:37.114
brown fat, and the reason it's
brown is that it's loaded with

00:24:37.114 --> 00:24:37.920
mitochondria.
 

00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:42.529
And so if they get a signal
that the temperature's dropping,

00:24:42.529 --> 00:24:45.269
and that comes into their
brain, into their hypothalamus,

00:24:45.269 --> 00:24:48.154
they will put out a hormone
that carries a hormonal signal

00:24:48.154 --> 00:24:51.223
out to their brown fat,
and the mitochondria in the

00:24:51.223 --> 00:24:55.125
brown fat receiving that signal
will start to simply generate

00:24:55.125 --> 00:24:57.490
energy,
and that generates heat.

00:24:57.490 --> 00:25:00.048
Okay?
 

00:25:00.048 --> 00:25:03.568
This is actually the mechanism
that allows hibernation,

00:25:03.568 --> 00:25:07.480
because they can regulate that
heat generation up or down.

00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:11.442
And hibernation is something
which is done in mammals,

00:25:11.442 --> 00:25:14.660
of course, to avoid dying,
in the winter.

00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:17.339
I have, I think,
three or four eastern chipmunks

00:25:17.339 --> 00:25:20.743
that live in my yard in Hamden,
and they tend to disappear

00:25:20.743 --> 00:25:24.353
towards the end of September,
and I'll probably first see

00:25:24.353 --> 00:25:27.318
them again sometime during the
next month.

00:25:27.318 --> 00:25:29.410
They've been down for several
months.

00:25:29.410 --> 00:25:30.180
Okay?
 

00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:32.805
They're all wrapped up in a
ball underground,

00:25:32.805 --> 00:25:33.759
sleeping away.
 

00:25:33.759 --> 00:25:39.255
And you can only do that if
you're kind of an intermediate

00:25:39.255 --> 00:25:39.930
size.
 

00:25:39.930 --> 00:25:46.272
So when it's preparing for
hibernation, it's regulating its

00:25:46.272 --> 00:25:48.680
temperature near 37.
 

00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:51.510
Then when it's down in the
ground, it will drop it,

00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:53.038
down to about 10 degrees.
 

00:25:53.038 --> 00:25:55.980
And it's got a temperature
sensor, in its brain,

00:25:55.980 --> 00:25:57.920
which keeps it from freezing.
 

00:25:57.920 --> 00:26:00.666
In other words,
the temperature will go down to

00:26:00.666 --> 00:26:04.011
about 10, or maybe a little bit
below in some other small

00:26:04.011 --> 00:26:06.759
mammals, but it will never go to
freezing.

00:26:06.759 --> 00:26:09.461
So it can tell if it's getting
dangerously cold,

00:26:09.461 --> 00:26:12.970
and it will regulate its lower
temperature with the brown fat,

00:26:12.970 --> 00:26:15.038
so it doesn't completely
freeze.

00:26:15.038 --> 00:26:18.691
And they do wake up a little
bit sometimes during the winter,

00:26:18.691 --> 00:26:20.700
but they don't really come out.
 

00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:24.009
They'll wake up and roll over,
and if they have stored seed

00:26:24.009 --> 00:26:27.317
underground, they will go eat
their seed stores so they can

00:26:27.317 --> 00:26:28.460
keep doing this.
 

00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:32.548
And then right about now
they'll come out again.

00:26:32.548 --> 00:26:37.190
So what's going on in one bout
of hibernation here--

00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:40.078
so if we just take one little
bout here--

00:26:40.078 --> 00:26:43.378
they drop their metabolic rate,
they drop their body

00:26:43.378 --> 00:26:46.739
temperature,
and for about a week they have

00:26:46.739 --> 00:26:51.038
a very low metabolic rate and a
low body temperature;

00:26:51.038 --> 00:26:57.115
it's down, in Centigrade,
it can get down to maybe 3 or 4

00:26:57.115 --> 00:26:58.200
degrees.
 

00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:03.098
And then they will arouse,
eat and then do it again.

00:27:03.098 --> 00:27:07.028
So this is regulated actually
both by physiology and by

00:27:07.028 --> 00:27:08.970
behavior;
and by morphology.

00:27:08.970 --> 00:27:11.058
They have pouches in their
cheeks where they can store the

00:27:11.058 --> 00:27:13.095
seeds,
and they have a seed deposit in

00:27:13.095 --> 00:27:15.743
their burrow,
and when they wake up and they

00:27:15.743 --> 00:27:17.836
need to recharge,
that's what they use,

00:27:17.836 --> 00:27:19.528
and then their physiology takes
over;

00:27:19.528 --> 00:27:21.220
and that's what gets them
through the winter.

00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:25.463
Now you can imagine that this
has greatly extended the

00:27:25.463 --> 00:27:29.949
geographical range in which
something like a chipmunk can

00:27:29.949 --> 00:27:30.670
live.
 

00:27:30.670 --> 00:27:33.561
Now I want you to think about
the surface area to volume

00:27:33.561 --> 00:27:34.720
ratios for a minute.
 

00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:38.676
I think you all know that the
surface area is proportional to

00:27:38.676 --> 00:27:42.986
the square of a body dimension,
and the volume of an organism

00:27:42.986 --> 00:27:46.548
is proportional to the cube of a
body dimension,

00:27:46.548 --> 00:27:49.773
so that when things get big,
they have proportionally less

00:27:49.773 --> 00:27:52.099
surface area,
and when they get small they

00:27:52.099 --> 00:27:54.078
have proportionally more surface
area.

00:27:54.078 --> 00:27:56.961
And I want you just to take a
minute and explain to your

00:27:56.961 --> 00:28:00.210
partner why it is that really
small things can't hibernate,

00:28:00.210 --> 00:28:03.068
and really big things can't
hibernate.

00:28:03.068 --> 00:28:06.798
And let's see how you do,
and I'll give you the answer in

00:28:06.798 --> 00:28:08.130
about two minutes.
 

00:28:08.130 --> 00:29:06.788
&lt;&lt;Students confer with
one another&gt;&gt;

00:29:06.788 --> 00:29:08.230
Student:  How do bears
hibernate?

00:29:08.230 --> 00:29:09.140
Prof: They don't.
 

00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:10.089
Student:  They don't?
 

00:29:10.089 --> 00:29:11.210
Prof: They sleep.
 

00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:26.328
Yes Myra?
 

00:29:26.328 --> 00:29:28.380
Student:  We learned
that bears hibernate--

00:29:28.380 --> 00:29:31.380
Prof: Bears don't
hibernate, they sleep.

00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:33.686
A very bad idea to try to take
the body temperature of a

00:29:33.686 --> 00:29:34.609
sleeping brown bear.
 

00:29:34.609 --> 00:29:35.960
It can wake up in a hurry.
 

00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:37.859
A chipmunk can't wake up.
 

00:29:37.859 --> 00:29:38.529
Student:  Oh.
 

00:29:38.529 --> 00:29:41.163
Prof: You can pick a
chipmunk up and toss it in your

00:29:41.163 --> 00:29:42.298
hand, it won't wake up.
 

00:29:42.298 --> 00:29:46.143
You go in and try to take the
rectal temperature of a brown

00:29:46.143 --> 00:29:49.390
bear and you better be ready to
run in a hurry.

00:29:49.390 --> 00:29:51.724
Student:  What is the
difference between hibernating

00:29:51.724 --> 00:29:52.328
and sleeping?
 

00:29:52.328 --> 00:29:56.880
Prof: How far the body
temperature will drop.

00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:59.440
A bear--your body temperature
drops when you sleep;

00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:03.286
it goes from about 98.6 down to
about 96 or 95,

00:30:03.286 --> 00:30:07.048
and then it warms back up when
you wake up.

00:30:07.048 --> 00:30:10.569
A bear might drop down to about
90.

00:30:10.569 --> 00:30:12.109
A chipmunk will drop to 40.
 

00:30:19.210 --> 00:30:24.105
Okay, who can tell me why
really small things can't

00:30:24.105 --> 00:30:25.278
hibernate?
 

00:30:25.278 --> 00:30:27.487
Like shrews,
which I have in my garage,

00:30:27.487 --> 00:30:29.230
in the middle of the winter.
 

00:30:29.230 --> 00:30:31.130
Okay, why do really small
things not hibernate?

00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:38.910
What's their problem with
surface area and volume?

00:30:38.910 --> 00:30:40.876
Student:  Their surface
area is really big compared to

00:30:40.876 --> 00:30:41.368
their volume.
 

00:30:41.368 --> 00:30:43.609
So there's a lot of surface
to--

00:30:43.609 --> 00:30:44.500
Prof: Right.
 

00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:47.473
So even though evolution has
done a great job of developing

00:30:47.473 --> 00:30:49.680
these temperature regulating
mechanisms,

00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:53.759
there comes a point at which
they can no longer do it,

00:30:53.759 --> 00:30:57.570
and if you get really small,
there's just no way that you

00:30:57.570 --> 00:31:01.518
can build say a 20 gram shrew
that will be able to regulate

00:31:01.518 --> 00:31:02.880
its temperature.
 

00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:04.839
It just has too much surface
area.

00:31:04.839 --> 00:31:05.880
Okay?
 

00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:08.420
What about something that's big?
 

00:31:08.420 --> 00:31:10.509
I've heard a couple of comments
about bears;

00:31:10.509 --> 00:31:11.828
bears are big.
 

00:31:11.828 --> 00:31:12.075
Okay?
 

00:31:12.075 --> 00:31:13.789
Bears don't hibernate,
they sleep.

00:31:13.789 --> 00:31:18.130
Why can the bear not hibernate?
 

00:31:18.130 --> 00:31:22.047
Remember, hibernation is a
condition where you really drop

00:31:22.047 --> 00:31:24.109
your body temperature a lot.
 

00:31:24.109 --> 00:31:24.960
Yes?
 

00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:28.188
Student:  Maybe its
volume to surface ratio is

00:31:28.188 --> 00:31:31.230
larger, and so it has
&gt;

00:31:31.230 --> 00:31:33.346
Prof: Yes,
it can't get rid of the heat

00:31:33.346 --> 00:31:35.368
fast enough to drop its body
temperature.

00:31:35.368 --> 00:31:39.467
So just a bunch of kind of
torpid bear fat,

00:31:39.467 --> 00:31:42.979
if it's alive,
is still making enough

00:31:42.979 --> 00:31:44.538
temperature.
 

00:31:44.538 --> 00:31:47.990
So it can't radiate it off fast
enough.

00:31:47.990 --> 00:31:51.400
So that's basically why you get
these rough limits.

00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:55.832
Even in something which is as
ectothermic as my compost heap

00:31:55.832 --> 00:31:58.801
in the backyard,
whose temperature is being

00:31:58.801 --> 00:32:02.280
regulated by bacteria and fungi,
I can go out there when it's 20

00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:04.394
degrees below 0,
take the snow off,

00:32:04.394 --> 00:32:07.490
and steam will come out of my
compost heap.

00:32:07.490 --> 00:32:08.278
Okay?
 

00:32:08.278 --> 00:32:12.684
Which is a pretty big area and
it has not too much surface area

00:32:12.684 --> 00:32:15.526
for a large volume,
and it maintains high

00:32:15.526 --> 00:32:18.440
temperature right through the
winter.

00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:24.390
Okay, now what about
evaporative water loss?

00:32:24.390 --> 00:32:29.558
Here is a real physiological
tradeoff.

00:32:29.558 --> 00:32:34.759
If you want to maintain your
internal temperature by cooling

00:32:34.759 --> 00:32:39.518
yourself through evaporation,
you need a good supply of

00:32:39.518 --> 00:32:41.586
water;
it can take a tremendous amount

00:32:41.586 --> 00:32:41.970
of water.
 

00:32:41.970 --> 00:32:45.497
As you all know,
when you get really thirsty,

00:32:45.497 --> 00:32:49.265
running or working,
to just maintain your proper

00:32:49.265 --> 00:32:51.588
balance of bodily fluids.
 

00:32:51.588 --> 00:32:58.092
And there comes a point where
the resting metabolic rate and

00:32:58.092 --> 00:33:02.170
the resting water loss really
get--

00:33:02.170 --> 00:33:04.415
there's an attempt here,
with the metabolic rate

00:33:04.415 --> 00:33:07.529
starting to go up,
that's because the water loss

00:33:07.529 --> 00:33:10.950
is no longer able to cool the
organism enough.

00:33:10.950 --> 00:33:14.170
So it gets up to about 42,43
Centigrade,

00:33:14.170 --> 00:33:17.218
and this little bird is getting
into serious difficulty because

00:33:17.218 --> 00:33:20.068
it can't evaporate enough to
hold its temperature down,

00:33:20.068 --> 00:33:23.269
and it's starting to get up
into dangerous territory.

00:33:23.269 --> 00:33:23.759
Okay?
 

00:33:27.650 --> 00:33:31.108
Really dangerous territory.
 

00:33:31.108 --> 00:33:35.900
So that's another illustration
of physiological ecology.

00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:40.111
Let's now go to plants,
and think about water in the

00:33:40.111 --> 00:33:40.690
soil.
 

00:33:40.690 --> 00:33:44.210
Because, of course,
for plants what do they need?

00:33:44.210 --> 00:33:46.979
Plants need sunlight,
they need water,

00:33:46.979 --> 00:33:50.136
they need carbon dioxide;
of course they need more than

00:33:50.136 --> 00:33:52.451
that, but if they're going to
make food, if they're going to

00:33:52.451 --> 00:33:54.568
feed, they need sunlight,
water and carbon dioxide.

00:33:54.568 --> 00:33:57.465
They're going to get their
water out of the soil,

00:33:57.465 --> 00:33:59.880
and they're going to do it with
roots.

00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:05.506
And if we look into the soil,
what we find basically is that

00:34:05.506 --> 00:34:09.130
at a certain pore size in the
soil--

00:34:12.750 --> 00:34:19.489
the low for certain levels of
water,

00:34:19.489 --> 00:34:22.230
right about here,
in terms of bars.

00:34:22.230 --> 00:34:25.860
By the way, the bars would mean
how much pressure do I have to

00:34:25.860 --> 00:34:29.489
exert on the soil in order to
see the water come out of it?

00:34:29.489 --> 00:34:33.902
So this would mean that I'd
have to exert a pressure of 1000

00:34:33.902 --> 00:34:38.090
atmospheres here to squeeze any
water out of the soil.

00:34:38.090 --> 00:34:40.389
So this would be really dry.
 

00:34:40.389 --> 00:34:42.989
This would be 10 atmospheres
here.

00:34:42.989 --> 00:34:47.719
And up here the water is
draining away freely.

00:34:47.719 --> 00:34:52.101
So this basically is the water
which is available to the

00:34:52.101 --> 00:34:52.820
plants.
 

00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:56.027
It's between about 10
atmospheres of pressure and

00:34:56.027 --> 00:34:59.969
about 1/10^(th) of an atmosphere
of pressure, right here.

00:34:59.969 --> 00:35:03.177
And that's associated with
whether you're dealing with

00:35:03.177 --> 00:35:05.719
soils which are very fine and
claylike--

00:35:05.719 --> 00:35:09.340
so they have fine particles and
small pores--

00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:14.882
or whether you are dealing with
soils that are gravely or sandy

00:35:14.882 --> 00:35:16.849
or things like that.
 

00:35:16.849 --> 00:35:22.538
So what the plant does is it
puts its roots down into the

00:35:22.538 --> 00:35:28.429
soil, and it's going to suck
that water out of the soil.

00:35:28.429 --> 00:35:32.072
Now I don't know if any of you
have ever stood on the edge of a

00:35:32.072 --> 00:35:35.717
pool and tried to suck the water
from a swimming pool up a tube

00:35:35.717 --> 00:35:38.010
which is only as tall as your
body;

00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:39.670
okay, less than 2 meters.
 

00:35:39.670 --> 00:35:40.989
It's hard.
 

00:35:40.989 --> 00:35:42.760
Your cheeks really hurt.
 

00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:44.539
And, in fact,
you can't do it very well.

00:35:44.539 --> 00:35:50.300
Most of us can deal all right
with the level of the latte or

00:35:50.300 --> 00:35:54.889
the milkshake,
but the swimming pool is hard.

00:35:54.889 --> 00:35:58.759
I now want you to think about a
Redwood or a Doug fir that is

00:35:58.759 --> 00:36:02.822
going to put its roots down into
the soil and suck that water up

00:36:02.822 --> 00:36:03.789
100 meters.
 

00:36:03.789 --> 00:36:06.809
&gt;
 

00:36:06.809 --> 00:36:08.570
It's not easy.
 

00:36:08.570 --> 00:36:14.349
There has to be tremendous
negative pressure maintained,

00:36:14.349 --> 00:36:19.146
continuously over that 100
meters, to pull that water up to

00:36:19.146 --> 00:36:23.224
where a leaf can use it,
to combine with carbon dioxide,

00:36:23.224 --> 00:36:27.192
using the energy from the sun,
to photosynthesize 100 meters

00:36:27.192 --> 00:36:28.329
off the ground.
 

00:36:28.329 --> 00:36:29.639
Okay? Not simple.
 

00:36:29.639 --> 00:36:32.340
So how do they do it?
 

00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:37.706
Well here's a leaf,
and here's the business end of

00:36:37.706 --> 00:36:41.429
the leaf, right here,
the stoma.

00:36:41.429 --> 00:36:45.056
There are some guard cells here
that are regulating the diameter

00:36:45.056 --> 00:36:45.920
of the stoma.
 

00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:50.362
There's carbon dioxide coming
in, and the oxygen is coming

00:36:50.362 --> 00:36:50.829
out.
 

00:36:50.829 --> 00:36:53.500
Here's the delivery system over
here.

00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:55.099
We've got the xylem and the
phloem.

00:36:55.099 --> 00:36:57.230
This is the vascular bundle.
 

00:36:57.230 --> 00:36:59.829
And the question is,
how do they do it?

00:36:59.829 --> 00:37:04.114
Well the transpirational pull
is being caused by the water

00:37:04.114 --> 00:37:06.820
that evaporates inside the
leaves.

00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:07.880
Okay?
 

00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:11.634
So if we go back to this,
you should think of water that

00:37:11.634 --> 00:37:14.980
is going to evaporate and go out
of the stoma--

00:37:14.980 --> 00:37:19.639
and it's coming off of these
cells right here,

00:37:19.639 --> 00:37:25.699
next to the xylem and the
phloem--and it will cause,

00:37:25.699 --> 00:37:27.500
as the water is evaporating
from the stoma,

00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:31.172
it will cause the water surface
in the stoma to pull back into

00:37:31.172 --> 00:37:34.027
pores in the cell walls--
well it's not from the stoma,

00:37:34.027 --> 00:37:37.697
it's actually from the cell,
inside the leaf--and there it

00:37:37.697 --> 00:37:40.840
will form kind of a concave
meniscus.

00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:43.996
But it's got very high surface
tension--and this is back to

00:37:43.996 --> 00:37:46.336
L.J. Henderson;
water has these amazing

00:37:46.336 --> 00:37:47.018
properties.
 

00:37:47.018 --> 00:37:48.980
Water has amazing surface
tension.

00:37:48.980 --> 00:37:53.000
Water can climb up the edge of
a glass.

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:54.840
Okay?
 

00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:57.565
And that's caused by the
hydrogen bonds between the water

00:37:57.565 --> 00:37:58.150
molecules.
 

00:37:58.150 --> 00:38:00.976
They have this beautiful
little, kind of Y-shaped

00:38:00.976 --> 00:38:03.920
structure, and they readily form
hydrogen bonds.

00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:08.918
And actually liquid water is
this beautiful set of sheets of

00:38:08.918 --> 00:38:13.750
these layers of molecules that
have formed these bonds.

00:38:13.750 --> 00:38:17.289
So that surface tension pulls
the concavity back out.

00:38:17.289 --> 00:38:19.018
Okay?
 

00:38:19.018 --> 00:38:22.628
So the combined force that's
generated by billions of these

00:38:22.628 --> 00:38:26.322
things is strong enough--
this should be 'lift' not

00:38:26.322 --> 00:38:30.510
'life'--to lift water from the
roots up 100 meters.

00:38:30.510 --> 00:38:35.271
Now if you're going to do that,
boy do you have to build a heck

00:38:35.271 --> 00:38:37.670
of a straw;
and that's what xylem is.

00:38:37.670 --> 00:38:37.932
Okay?
 

00:38:37.932 --> 00:38:41.036
The xylem vessels that will
transport the water have to have

00:38:41.036 --> 00:38:42.300
very small diameters.
 

00:38:42.300 --> 00:38:44.800
They have to be built very
strongly,

00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:47.072
because otherwise the water
cone is going to be broken by

00:38:47.072 --> 00:38:48.813
cavitation,
and as soon as it's broken by

00:38:48.813 --> 00:38:52.307
cavitation,
the leaves on the top dry out

00:38:52.307 --> 00:38:53.230
and die.
 

00:38:53.230 --> 00:38:56.396
So cavitation is a big problem;
that's the formation of a

00:38:56.396 --> 00:38:57.809
bubble, inside the xylem.
 

00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:05.153
Okay, that was a little bit
about the physiology of how

00:39:05.153 --> 00:39:06.070
plants drink.
 

00:39:06.070 --> 00:39:09.170
It's more complicated than
that, but I think that I have

00:39:09.170 --> 00:39:12.268
been able at least to illustrate
the problem to you,

00:39:12.268 --> 00:39:16.148
and I think I have shown you
that the physiological problem

00:39:16.148 --> 00:39:20.094
posed by the environment has
been solved by the evolution of

00:39:20.094 --> 00:39:24.119
xylem and phloem;
which happened about 3 to 400

00:39:24.119 --> 00:39:28.543
million years ago,
and has since been perfected to

00:39:28.543 --> 00:39:30.170
a great degree.
 

00:39:30.170 --> 00:39:34.594
If you go out now and you're
doing work in the short-grass

00:39:34.594 --> 00:39:36.529
prairie,
or in the long-grass prairie,

00:39:36.529 --> 00:39:39.179
for that matter--
Mindy Smith works in the Kanza

00:39:39.179 --> 00:39:42.427
Prairie in Kansas,
and in South Africa--and you do

00:39:42.427 --> 00:39:45.755
a section through the soil,
you can see that a lot of the

00:39:45.755 --> 00:39:48.375
life of plants,
and a lot of both their

00:39:48.375 --> 00:39:52.724
individual ecology and their
competitive relationships with

00:39:52.724 --> 00:39:55.731
other plants,
is actually being mediated by

00:39:55.731 --> 00:39:58.239
where their roots are foraging
for water.

00:39:58.239 --> 00:40:01.251
Some of them can go deep,
some of them stay shallow,

00:40:01.251 --> 00:40:04.795
and they partition that soil
environment into different areas

00:40:04.795 --> 00:40:06.980
that they are sucking water
from.

00:40:06.980 --> 00:40:08.820
By the way, the earthworms are
also partitioning it.

00:40:08.820 --> 00:40:12.197
There are some that up here and
some that are down there,

00:40:12.197 --> 00:40:14.369
and some that move back and
forth.

00:40:14.369 --> 00:40:17.385
So there are some organisms,
some plants,

00:40:17.385 --> 00:40:20.250
that are really extreme
competitors.

00:40:20.250 --> 00:40:22.619
Eucalyptus trees from
Australia, and Casuarina trees,

00:40:22.619 --> 00:40:23.869
which come from Northern
Australia,

00:40:23.869 --> 00:40:26.280
New Guinea and the Solomon
Islands,

00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:28.130
have been introduced around the
world.

00:40:28.130 --> 00:40:31.237
So I have been in a field
station in Corsica,

00:40:31.237 --> 00:40:33.570
surrounded by Eucalyptus trees.
 

00:40:33.570 --> 00:40:36.097
I've been on the Berkeley
Campus surrounded by Eucalyptus

00:40:36.097 --> 00:40:36.460
trees.
 

00:40:36.460 --> 00:40:39.239
I have been in Central Uganda,
surrounded by Eucalyptus trees.

00:40:39.239 --> 00:40:41.885
People have just planted these
things all over the world,

00:40:41.885 --> 00:40:44.579
and boy are they good at
sucking water out of the soil.

00:40:44.579 --> 00:40:46.570
And, in fact,
what they'll do is they'll suck

00:40:46.570 --> 00:40:48.880
the water table down to where
they will kill off any

00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:51.666
competitors,
because they've just made a

00:40:51.666 --> 00:40:54.579
desert out of the upper layer of
soil.

00:40:54.579 --> 00:40:56.469
Casuarina does much the same
thing;

00:40:56.469 --> 00:40:58.711
and Casuarina also has the
advantage that it can fix

00:40:58.711 --> 00:41:01.217
nitrogen in its root nodules,
and so it can grow in places

00:41:01.217 --> 00:41:02.670
that many other things can't.
 

00:41:02.670 --> 00:41:06.320
So these things spread quite
well.

00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:08.579
If you were to do this kind of
section,

00:41:08.579 --> 00:41:12.012
not in a short-grass prairie,
but if you were to go into the

00:41:12.012 --> 00:41:15.677
Kalahari Desert and look at how
far down an Acacia tree can send

00:41:15.677 --> 00:41:18.570
its roots,
it'll go down 46 meters.

00:41:18.570 --> 00:41:19.500
Okay?
 

00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:24.815
Well 46 meters is over 150 feet
deep, down, and it's going to

00:41:24.815 --> 00:41:27.739
suck that water up into a tree.
 

00:41:27.739 --> 00:41:31.811
which is probably 20 meters
high, and in the process it's

00:41:31.811 --> 00:41:36.246
going to drive the water table
down to where many other things

00:41:36.246 --> 00:41:38.210
can't reach it anymore.
 

00:41:38.210 --> 00:41:41.561
So these physiological
adaptations are things that not

00:41:41.561 --> 00:41:45.481
only have consequences for the
survival and the reproduction of

00:41:45.481 --> 00:41:49.157
the individual organisms,
they also have consequences for

00:41:49.157 --> 00:41:51.510
everything which is living
around them,

00:41:51.510 --> 00:41:56.141
and the ones that can do it
better hurt the ones that can't

00:41:56.141 --> 00:41:57.420
do it so well.
 

00:41:57.420 --> 00:41:59.280
If we go into the environment
of estuaries,

00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:04.018
the plants that are growing in
estuaries,

00:42:04.018 --> 00:42:07.150
like these mangroves,
have the problem that is

00:42:07.150 --> 00:42:11.115
basically caused by the fact
that estuaries are one of the

00:42:11.115 --> 00:42:13.900
most productive ecosystems on
earth.

00:42:13.900 --> 00:42:16.590
And there's just a tremendous
amount of leaf litter,

00:42:16.590 --> 00:42:19.690
and there are algae living in
the water,

00:42:19.690 --> 00:42:22.498
and the leaves and the dead
algae and whatnot fall down to

00:42:22.498 --> 00:42:24.570
the bottom and they start to
decompose,

00:42:24.570 --> 00:42:27.280
and the bacteria that are
decomposing them use up the

00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:27.750
oxygen.
 

00:42:27.750 --> 00:42:31.730
And so if you take a sample
down, through the mud,

00:42:31.730 --> 00:42:36.150
the soil, at the bottom of one
of these mangrove estuaries,

00:42:36.150 --> 00:42:40.139
you will hit a layer that is
just black.

00:42:40.139 --> 00:42:42.360
It is a very reducing
environment.

00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:45.306
It's got hydrogen sulfide,
stinks like rotten eggs,

00:42:45.306 --> 00:42:48.253
and if you're a root of a
plant, living down there,

00:42:48.253 --> 00:42:51.199
you've got a problem,
because you need oxygen.

00:42:51.199 --> 00:42:55.125
You are a multi-cellular plant,
and all of your cells have

00:42:55.125 --> 00:42:57.880
evolved in an oxygenated
environment,

00:42:57.880 --> 00:43:01.041
at least in your ancestors,
but now your ecology is asking

00:43:01.041 --> 00:43:04.369
you to grow in a place where in
order to feed your plant,

00:43:04.369 --> 00:43:07.860
you have to probe into what is
an extremely dangerous

00:43:07.860 --> 00:43:10.530
environment;
it doesn't have any oxygen in

00:43:10.530 --> 00:43:10.768
it.
 

00:43:10.768 --> 00:43:16.179
And so mangroves have these
morphological adaptations.

00:43:16.179 --> 00:43:20.159
Their roots stick up little
siphons--

00:43:20.159 --> 00:43:25.898
okay, they have snorkels--so
that the roots can suck oxygen

00:43:25.898 --> 00:43:28.835
down,
from above, and get a flow of

00:43:28.835 --> 00:43:32.090
oxygen coming down that will
help them out.

00:43:32.090 --> 00:43:33.969
Remember, the roots don't have
chloroplasts.

00:43:33.969 --> 00:43:35.429
They're down in a dark
environment.

00:43:35.429 --> 00:43:37.342
They can't make their oxygen
endogenously,

00:43:37.342 --> 00:43:39.489
they've got to get it out of
the atmosphere.

00:43:39.489 --> 00:43:41.510
So this is what happens.
 

00:43:45.030 --> 00:43:47.809
Okay, so I've done this fairly
quickly.

00:43:47.809 --> 00:43:51.050
But the point of it is that
both in plants and animals,

00:43:51.050 --> 00:43:54.789
and endotherms and ectotherms,
anything you look at,

00:43:54.789 --> 00:43:58.889
any organism,
from a virus and a bacterium,

00:43:58.889 --> 00:44:00.800
on up to a blue whale and a
redwood,

00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:02.050
that you look at on the face of
the earth,

00:44:02.050 --> 00:44:05.144
is going to be loaded with
physiological and morphological

00:44:05.144 --> 00:44:07.188
adaptations,
and these things are

00:44:07.188 --> 00:44:10.503
determining the range of
conditions and resources under

00:44:10.503 --> 00:44:12.960
which they can survive and
reproduce.

00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:16.036
So if we look at that,
just as a general conceptual

00:44:16.036 --> 00:44:20.099
problem, we can summarize it in
the form of an ecological niche.

00:44:20.099 --> 00:44:21.360
Okay?
 

00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:24.900
So if you look at the
performance of that species,

00:44:24.900 --> 00:44:27.929
with respect to some
environmental variable--

00:44:27.929 --> 00:44:31.469
this could be temperature or
oxygen concentration or pH--

00:44:31.469 --> 00:44:36.614
there will be a range of that
environmental variable within

00:44:36.614 --> 00:44:39.809
which the organism can
reproduce,

00:44:39.809 --> 00:44:43.960
there'll be a slightly broader
range within which it can grow,

00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:48.081
and there will be an even
broader range within which it

00:44:48.081 --> 00:44:49.150
can survive.
 

00:44:49.150 --> 00:44:53.572
So it can explore parts of the
environment within which it

00:44:53.572 --> 00:44:58.382
cannot grow, and it can grow in
parts of the environment within

00:44:58.382 --> 00:45:00.710
which it cannot reproduce.
 

00:45:00.710 --> 00:45:05.981
But there will be a core where
life is easy and it can carry

00:45:05.981 --> 00:45:07.768
out its lifecycle.
 

00:45:07.768 --> 00:45:11.050
For example,
here's a two-dimensional niche.

00:45:11.050 --> 00:45:12.670
This one is just measuring
survival.

00:45:12.670 --> 00:45:14.480
So these are actually
experimental data.

00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:18.659
This is salinity down here and
temperature over here.

00:45:18.659 --> 00:45:21.860
And it's for a sand shrimp,
Crangon.

00:45:21.860 --> 00:45:27.041
And basically what this is
telling you is that it has zero

00:45:27.041 --> 00:45:32.768
mortality in a salinity range of
about two-thirds sea water,

00:45:32.768 --> 00:45:34.789
up to slightly over full sea
water.

00:45:34.789 --> 00:45:38.197
This is full sea water right
here, about 35 parts per

00:45:38.197 --> 00:45:38.920
thousand.
 

00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:44.804
And up here it's showing you
that it will start hitting some

00:45:44.804 --> 00:45:50.389
mortality at about 25,
and some mortality at about 10.

00:45:50.389 --> 00:45:51.619
Okay?
 

00:45:51.619 --> 00:45:54.380
So you could imagine carrying
this process further,

00:45:54.380 --> 00:45:56.190
putting a third dimension on,
putting a fourth dimension on,

00:45:56.190 --> 00:46:00.666
and having the organism tell
you in what part of the

00:46:00.666 --> 00:46:05.760
potential range of conditions on
the planet can it live.

00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:08.833
And there are interactions--I
mean, an interaction will be any

00:46:08.833 --> 00:46:10.900
time there's a curve in the
slope here.

00:46:10.900 --> 00:46:12.190
Okay?
 

00:46:12.190 --> 00:46:18.550
So the range of salinities at
which it has no mortality is

00:46:18.550 --> 00:46:20.543
affected,
to a certain,

00:46:20.543 --> 00:46:22.559
and in this case fairly slight
degree,

00:46:22.559 --> 00:46:23.690
by the range of temperatures.
 

00:46:27.099 --> 00:46:32.230
So the niche is an
N-dimensional hyper-volume.

00:46:32.230 --> 00:46:36.029
We just saw a two-dimensional
one here, and I told you that

00:46:36.029 --> 00:46:38.844
could be extended to three,
four, five, ten,

00:46:38.844 --> 00:46:41.400
however many you wanted to pack
on.

00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:45.760
That is a mental tool,
and it was invented by humans,

00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:49.144
actually in this building,
to understand how organisms

00:46:49.144 --> 00:46:52.018
evolve to deal with
environmental problems.

00:46:52.018 --> 00:46:52.521
Okay?
 

00:46:52.521 --> 00:46:56.929
So it's an attempt to extract
key features.

00:46:56.929 --> 00:46:59.684
You can think of those
dimensions both as abiotic and

00:46:59.684 --> 00:47:00.320
as biotic.
 

00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:03.275
So the abiotic ones usually are
things like temperature,

00:47:03.275 --> 00:47:05.532
salinity, humidity,
oxygen, carbon dioxide,

00:47:05.532 --> 00:47:05.909
pH.
 

00:47:05.909 --> 00:47:09.250
The biotic ones are predators,
competitors,

00:47:09.250 --> 00:47:13.539
pathogens, mutualists;
and the biotic ones co-evolve.

00:47:13.539 --> 00:47:13.800
Okay?
 

00:47:13.800 --> 00:47:17.038
So the niche of one species is
going to be co-evolving with the

00:47:17.038 --> 00:47:18.500
niche of another species.
 

00:47:18.500 --> 00:47:22.972
So you should think of these
things as changing through

00:47:22.972 --> 00:47:24.630
evolutionary time.
 

00:47:24.630 --> 00:47:27.393
All the biological evolution in
the world isn't going to do very

00:47:27.393 --> 00:47:29.849
much to the distribution of
temperature on the planet.

00:47:29.849 --> 00:47:32.679
So it's not as though the
biotic variables are going to be

00:47:32.679 --> 00:47:35.510
causing a co-evolutionary
response in the abiotic ones;

00:47:35.510 --> 00:47:36.199
they won't.
 

00:47:36.199 --> 00:47:39.780
Those things are just things
that are imposed on the process.

00:47:39.780 --> 00:47:42.250
But if you have a predator/prey
interaction,

00:47:42.250 --> 00:47:46.092
or a parasite/host interaction,
or two competitors dealing with

00:47:46.092 --> 00:47:48.920
each other,
the area of the niche

00:47:48.920 --> 00:47:52.173
hyper-volume,
within which each of them can

00:47:52.173 --> 00:47:54.976
reproduce and survive,
is going to be changed by their

00:47:54.976 --> 00:47:55.550
co-evolution.
 

00:47:58.659 --> 00:48:02.929
So what that means is that
niches aren't pre-existing

00:48:02.929 --> 00:48:06.295
molds, out there,
into which organisms are

00:48:06.295 --> 00:48:07.199
poured.
 

00:48:07.199 --> 00:48:11.070
They are the products of an
evolutionary play that is

00:48:11.070 --> 00:48:14.940
creating the theater while it's
writing the roles.

00:48:14.940 --> 00:48:19.021
And while the play is running,
evolution is rewriting the

00:48:19.021 --> 00:48:21.103
script,
it's remodeling the actors,

00:48:21.103 --> 00:48:24.670
it's putting in new actors,
it's redesigning the sets,

00:48:24.670 --> 00:48:27.349
and it's renovating the
theater.

00:48:27.349 --> 00:48:30.300
It's a very long running play,
it's got a lot of characters.

00:48:33.639 --> 00:48:37.347
So if you think of a niche as
static, essentially what you're

00:48:37.347 --> 00:48:40.621
doing is you're just taking a
snapshot out of a video,

00:48:40.621 --> 00:48:42.599
or a snapshot out of a film.
 

00:48:42.599 --> 00:48:43.400
Okay?
 

00:48:43.400 --> 00:48:46.380
They're really dynamic things.
 

00:48:46.380 --> 00:48:50.409
Okay next week,
next time, we will start with

00:48:50.409 --> 00:48:55.355
population growth and the issue
of what density does to

00:48:55.355 --> 00:48:57.369
population growth.

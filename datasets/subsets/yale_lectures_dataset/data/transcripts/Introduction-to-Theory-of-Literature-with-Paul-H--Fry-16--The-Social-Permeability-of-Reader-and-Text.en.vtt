00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:07.360
Prof: So we arrive at
our turn to sociogenesis.

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:11.440
Genesis is, of course,
here obviously--even as we read

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.674
both Jauss and Bakhtin for
today--a misleading term in a

00:00:15.674 --> 00:00:18.739
certain sense;
because obviously,

00:00:18.739 --> 00:00:24.150
the most egregious difference
between Jauss and Bakhtin--

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.200
and once again you're probably
saying to yourself,

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.130
"Well, my goodness.
 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.690
Why have these two texts been
put together?"--

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:34.373
the most egregious difference
is that Bakhtin's primary

00:00:34.373 --> 00:00:38.190
concern is with the "life
world"

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.785
that produces a text and Jauss'
primary concern is with the

00:00:42.785 --> 00:00:45.954
"life world,"
or perhaps better

00:00:45.954 --> 00:00:48.886
"succession of life
worlds,"

00:00:48.886 --> 00:00:51.580
in which a text is received.
 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:53.921
I think you can tell,
however, from reading both

00:00:53.921 --> 00:00:57.324
texts,
and will be conscious as you go

00:00:57.324 --> 00:01:02.280
through the materials that
remain on the syllabus,

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.444
that the relationship between
the production and reception of

00:01:07.444 --> 00:01:11.551
literature,
or of discourse of any kind,

00:01:11.551 --> 00:01:17.250
once you factor in the social
setting of such a text,

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.280
becomes much more permeable,
much more fluid.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.537
There's a certain sense in
which the producer is the

00:01:24.537 --> 00:01:27.275
receiver;
in which the author is the

00:01:27.275 --> 00:01:31.584
reader and stands in relation to
a tradition, to a past,

00:01:31.584 --> 00:01:34.805
as a reader;
and the reader in turn,

00:01:34.805 --> 00:01:39.340
in continuing to circulate
texts through history--

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.411
that is to say,
in playing a role as someone

00:01:42.411 --> 00:01:47.667
who keeps texts current--
is perhaps even in concrete

00:01:47.667 --> 00:01:49.640
terms a writer.
 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.480
That is to say,
he or she is someone who

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.178
expresses opinions,
circulates values,

00:01:55.178 --> 00:01:58.530
and keeps texts,
as I say, in circulation.

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.917
I've always felt this about
Jauss's sense of what a reader

00:02:03.917 --> 00:02:04.390
is.
 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.639
What kind of reader would it be
who was responsible for the

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:12.394
continued presence,
or influence,

00:02:12.394 --> 00:02:15.802
of a text through literary
history who wasn't in some sense

00:02:15.802 --> 00:02:17.449
communicating an opinion?
 

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:21.473
This is obviously truer today
than ever before when we have

00:02:21.473 --> 00:02:25.637
blogs and discussion groups and
when everybody is circulating

00:02:25.637 --> 00:02:27.650
opinions on the internet.
 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.812
Plainly the reader,
plainly the taste-maker,

00:02:31.812 --> 00:02:37.430
the reader as taste-maker,
is at the same time a writer.

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.006
Just in passing--this has
become a digression but I hope a

00:02:42.006 --> 00:02:44.613
useful one--
in this context,

00:02:44.613 --> 00:02:48.970
one can think about a really
strange pairing,

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.740
Jauss in relation to Bloom.
 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:56.549
If Bloom's theory of strong
misreading as a principle of

00:02:56.549 --> 00:03:01.620
literary historiography can be
understood as a relationship

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.430
between writers as readers and
readers as writers,

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:13.587
so by the same token if we see
Jauss's analysis of reception in

00:03:13.587 --> 00:03:17.485
these terms,
and if we think of reception as

00:03:17.485 --> 00:03:20.068
a necessary circulation of
opinion,

00:03:20.068 --> 00:03:22.628
there is, after all,
a sense in which for Jauss,

00:03:22.628 --> 00:03:26.669
too, the reader is a writer and
the writer is a reader.

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:30.270
That is undoubtedly a remote
connection,

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:35.175
but it is a way of seeing how
both Bloom and Jauss are figures

00:03:35.175 --> 00:03:39.920
who have strong and interesting
and plausible theories about

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.610
literary history.
 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:42.590
All right.
 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.800
To go, however,
back to the beginning--

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.628
back to the sense in which
we're at a watershed,

00:03:48.628 --> 00:03:51.690
or a moment of transition in
this course,

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:56.354
leaving for the moment out of
the picture the intermediate

00:03:56.354 --> 00:04:00.106
step of psychogenesis--
to go back to this sense of our

00:04:00.106 --> 00:04:01.979
being in a moment of
transition--

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:04.961
as always, such is the
calendar, just at the wrong

00:04:04.961 --> 00:04:07.758
time: we finally accomplish our
transition,

00:04:07.758 --> 00:04:11.705
then we go off to spring break,
forget everything we ever knew

00:04:11.705 --> 00:04:15.908
and come back and start off once
again as a tabula rasa.

00:04:15.908 --> 00:04:20.250
We'll do our best to bridge
that gap.

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.108
In any case,
if we now find ourselves

00:04:23.108 --> 00:04:28.110
understanding in reading these
two texts for the first time,

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:31.454
really--although it's not that
we haven't been talking about

00:04:31.454 --> 00:04:32.930
"life"
before.

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.447
Obviously, we have been,
as it's not as though the

00:04:36.447 --> 00:04:40.899
Russian formalists culminating
in the structuralism of Jakobson

00:04:40.899 --> 00:04:44.060
don't talk about a referential
function.

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:48.795
It's unfair even to the New
Critics to say that somehow the

00:04:48.795 --> 00:04:52.958
world is excluded from the
interpretative or reading

00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:55.666
process--
even though all along we've

00:04:55.666 --> 00:05:00.949
been saying things like this,
we still sense a difference.

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:05.088
The difference is in the
perceived relationship between

00:05:05.088 --> 00:05:08.141
the text,
the object of study,

00:05:08.141 --> 00:05:12.103
and the life world--
the sense, in fact,

00:05:12.103 --> 00:05:15.100
in which a text is a life
world.

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:18.889
This has, after all,
something to do with our

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:21.990
understanding of what language
is.

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:27.774
So far we have been thinking of
language as a semiotic code and

00:05:27.774 --> 00:05:33.187
also with the strong suspicion
that this semiotic code is a

00:05:33.187 --> 00:05:34.680
virtual one.
 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:39.060
We have been emphasizing the
degree to which we are passive

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:42.023
in relation to,
or even, as it were,

00:05:42.023 --> 00:05:44.990
"spoken by"
this language.

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:47.940
In other words,
it's been a constant in our

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:52.440
thinking about these matters
that language speaks through us,

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:56.791
but we have exercised so far a
curious reticence about the

00:05:56.791 --> 00:06:01.220
sense in which this language is
not just a code,

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:05.850
not just something that exists
virtually at a given historical

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:09.129
moment,
but is in fact a code made up

00:06:09.129 --> 00:06:13.040
of other people's language:
in other words,

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:16.278
that it is language in
circulation,

00:06:16.278 --> 00:06:22.303
not just language as somehow
abstractly outside of networks

00:06:22.303 --> 00:06:25.939
of circulation available for
use.

00:06:25.939 --> 00:06:29.509
So we begin now to think of
language still,

00:06:29.509 --> 00:06:33.589
and the relationship between
language and speech,

00:06:33.589 --> 00:06:38.350
but now it's not a language
abstracted from reality;

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:42.485
it's a language which,
precisely, circulates

00:06:42.485 --> 00:06:47.365
within reality and as a matter
of social exchange and social

00:06:47.365 --> 00:06:48.690
interaction.
 

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:54.930
Language is now and henceforth
on our syllabus a social

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:56.550
institution.
 

00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:01.687
In literary theory it has the
same determinative relationship

00:07:01.687 --> 00:07:06.971
with my individual speech,
but we now begin to understand

00:07:06.971 --> 00:07:12.389
the claim that I don't speak my
own language in a different

00:07:12.389 --> 00:07:13.509
register.
 

00:07:13.509 --> 00:07:15.949
Hitherto it's been,
well, "Language is there

00:07:15.949 --> 00:07:18.862
before me,
what I speak is just sort of

00:07:18.862 --> 00:07:23.286
that which I borrow from
it," but now this takes on

00:07:23.286 --> 00:07:25.540
a new valency altogether.
 

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:28.009
What I don't speak is my
language;

00:07:28.009 --> 00:07:31.139
it's other people's language.
 

00:07:31.139 --> 00:07:34.504
My voice--and the word
"voice"

00:07:34.504 --> 00:07:38.129
is obviously under heavy
pressure here,

00:07:38.129 --> 00:07:41.060
even though nobody says it goes
away--

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:48.240
my voice is a voice permeated
by all the sedimentations,

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:52.593
registers, levels,
and orientations of language in

00:07:52.593 --> 00:07:55.259
the world that surrounds me.
 

00:07:55.259 --> 00:07:57.237
I take my language,
in other words,

00:07:57.237 --> 00:07:58.399
from other people.
 

00:07:58.399 --> 00:08:03.096
I stand here--for my
sins--lecturing in kind of an

00:08:03.096 --> 00:08:08.752
ad-lib way, and that makes it
even more pronounced in what I

00:08:08.752 --> 00:08:09.519
say.
 

00:08:09.519 --> 00:08:11.689
You're hearing the internet.
 

00:08:11.689 --> 00:08:13.879
You're hearing newspaper
headlines.

00:08:13.879 --> 00:08:15.470
You're hearing slang.
 

00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:20.074
You're hearing all sorts of
locutions and rhetorical devices

00:08:20.074 --> 00:08:24.600
that I'd be ashamed to call
mine, &gt;

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:28.829
at least in many cases,
because they are in the world;

00:08:28.829 --> 00:08:31.240
they are out there, as we say.
 

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:35.418
What's out there gets to the
point where it's in here,

00:08:35.418 --> 00:08:39.791
and the next thing you know,
it becomes part of the ongoing

00:08:39.791 --> 00:08:42.580
patter or blather of an
individual.

00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:46.672
It is, in other words,
the speech of others that

00:08:46.672 --> 00:08:50.590
you're hearing when you hear an
individual.

00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:55.217
The extent or the degree to
which this might be the case is,

00:08:55.217 --> 00:08:58.200
I suppose, always subject to
debate.

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:01.918
We're going to take up a couple
of examples,

00:09:01.918 --> 00:09:05.297
but in any case,
you can see that without the

00:09:05.297 --> 00:09:09.596
structure of the relationship
between language and speech

00:09:09.596 --> 00:09:13.488
having really changed--
and in fact it won't really

00:09:13.488 --> 00:09:16.928
change as we continue along--
without the structure of the

00:09:16.928 --> 00:09:19.870
relationship between language
and speech having changed,

00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:24.509
the nature of this relationship
and the way in which we think of

00:09:24.509 --> 00:09:29.566
it in social terms is changed,
and the social aspect of it now

00:09:29.566 --> 00:09:33.379
comes into prominence and will
remain there.

00:09:33.379 --> 00:09:37.447
Now in order to see how this
works in the case of today's two

00:09:37.447 --> 00:09:39.889
authors a little more
concretely,

00:09:39.889 --> 00:09:45.990
I wanted to turn to a couple of
passages on your sheet.

00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:50.174
You got my grim warning last
night that if you didn't bring

00:09:50.174 --> 00:09:52.990
it, I wouldn't have any to
circulate.

00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:56.427
We'll see how well that worked,
and if it didn't work,

00:09:56.427 --> 00:09:59.538
well, perhaps it'll work better
in the future.

00:09:59.538 --> 00:10:02.586
In any case,
first of all turning to the

00:10:02.586 --> 00:10:05.788
first passage on the sheet by
Bakhtin--

00:10:05.788 --> 00:10:09.370
by the way, if you don't have
the sheet,

00:10:09.370 --> 00:10:13.331
maybe somebody near you does,
or maybe somebody near you has

00:10:13.331 --> 00:10:17.293
a computer which is being used
for the correct purposes that

00:10:17.293 --> 00:10:19.509
can be &gt;
 

00:10:19.509 --> 00:10:23.700
held somehow between the two of
you.

00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:25.740
These are all possibilities.
 

00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:31.691
The first passage on the sheet
by Bakhtin is about the

00:10:31.691 --> 00:10:37.418
relationship between what he
takes to be a formalist

00:10:37.418 --> 00:10:41.908
understanding of
double-voicedness--

00:10:41.908 --> 00:10:45.022
for example,
the new critical understanding

00:10:45.022 --> 00:10:49.616
which he's not directly talking
about but which we could use as

00:10:49.616 --> 00:10:54.364
an example of irony--
the ways of talking about not

00:10:54.364 --> 00:10:56.558
meaning what you say.
 

00:10:56.558 --> 00:11:01.263
He's talking about those sorts
of double-voicedness in

00:11:01.263 --> 00:11:05.028
relationship to,
in contradistinction to,

00:11:05.028 --> 00:11:09.363
what he means by "genuine
heteroglossia,"

00:11:09.363 --> 00:11:12.330
and he says,
first passage on the sheet:

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:17.452
Rhetoric is often limited to
purely verbal victories over the

00:11:17.452 --> 00:11:20.440
word, over ideological
authority.

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:25.923
[In other words,
I am sort of getting under your

00:11:25.923 --> 00:11:30.942
ribs if you're somehow or
another voicing an

00:11:30.942 --> 00:11:35.350
authoritative,
widespread, or tyrannical

00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:39.820
opinion by some form or another
of subverting it--

00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:43.971
in other words,
a kind of a binary relationship

00:11:43.971 --> 00:11:49.115
between what I'm saying and
what's commonly being said out

00:11:49.115 --> 00:11:51.822
there.]
When this happens [says

00:11:51.822 --> 00:11:54.799
Bakhtin]
rhetoric degenerates into

00:11:54.799 --> 00:12:00.576
formalistic verbal play but,
we repeat, when discourse is

00:12:00.576 --> 00:12:05.710
torn from reality it is fatal
for the word itself as well.

00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:09.131
Words grow sickly,
lose semantic depth and

00:12:09.131 --> 00:12:14.056
flexibility, the capacity to
expand and renew their meanings

00:12:14.056 --> 00:12:16.308
in new living contexts.
 

00:12:16.308 --> 00:12:20.397
They essentially die as
discourse, for the signifying

00:12:20.397 --> 00:12:25.476
word lives beyond itself;
that is, it lives by directing

00:12:25.476 --> 00:12:28.139
its purposiveness outward.
 

00:12:28.139 --> 00:12:31.573
Double-voicedness,
which is merely verbal,

00:12:31.573 --> 00:12:36.349
is not structured on authentic
heteroglossia but on a mere

00:12:36.349 --> 00:12:38.360
diversity of voices.
 

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:41.465
In other words,
it doesn't take into account

00:12:41.465 --> 00:12:45.653
the way in which there are
seepages or permeabilities among

00:12:45.653 --> 00:12:49.120
the possibilities and registers
of meaning,

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:55.576
depending on extraordinarily
complex speaking communities

00:12:55.576 --> 00:13:00.879
coming together in any aspect of
discourse,

00:13:00.879 --> 00:13:05.514
ways in which we have to think
about the life world of a

00:13:05.514 --> 00:13:09.980
discourse in order to understand
the play of voice.

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:13.750
Heteroglossia is the language
of others.

00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:19.667
That's what it means if we are
to to understand the way in

00:13:19.667 --> 00:13:26.000
which the language of others is
playing through and permeating

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.350
the text.
 

00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:31.874
A comparable response to
formalism on the part of Hans

00:13:31.874 --> 00:13:35.264
Robert Jauss--
I should say in passing that

00:13:35.264 --> 00:13:39.317
both Bakhtin and Jauss have
authentic and close relations

00:13:39.317 --> 00:13:41.558
with the Russian formalists.
 

00:13:41.558 --> 00:13:44.759
Bakhtin begins,
in a way, at the very end of

00:13:44.759 --> 00:13:48.668
the formalist tradition,
as a kind of second generation

00:13:48.668 --> 00:13:52.710
formalist,
but quickly moves away--it is

00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:59.927
breaking up in the late 1920s--
from that and begins to rewrite

00:13:59.927 --> 00:14:07.006
formalism in a certain sense as
a sociogenesis of discourse in

00:14:07.006 --> 00:14:10.153
language;
and by the same token,

00:14:10.153 --> 00:14:13.500
Jauss in his theory of literary
history--

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:27.340
which is not enunciated in
these terms in the text that you

00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:32.033
have,
but rather in the long text

00:14:32.033 --> 00:14:37.500
from which I wish your editor
had taken an excerpt,

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:42.899
called "Literary History
as a Provocation to Literary

00:14:42.899 --> 00:14:44.320
Theory."
 

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:48.048
You have excerpts from that on
your sheet.

00:14:48.048 --> 00:14:53.298
In any case,
in Jauss' understanding of the

00:14:53.298 --> 00:14:59.799
relationship between the text
and the life world,

00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:16.740
Jauss cobbles together,
as it were,

00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:20.399
aspects of Russian formalist
historiography,

00:15:20.399 --> 00:15:23.710
particularly that of Jakobson
and Tynjanov,

00:15:23.710 --> 00:15:28.620
and a Marxist understanding of,
as it were,

00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:34.261
the marketing,
reception, and consumption of

00:15:34.261 --> 00:15:37.149
literary production.
 

00:15:37.149 --> 00:15:40.755
These pairs of ideas go
together in his developing of

00:15:40.755 --> 00:15:44.708
his thesis about literary
reception, to which we'll return

00:15:44.708 --> 00:15:46.788
at the end of the lecture.
 

00:15:46.788 --> 00:15:51.253
The second passage on the
sheet, which distances him,

00:15:51.253 --> 00:15:56.231
in which he wants to distance
himself somewhat from both of

00:15:56.231 --> 00:15:59.580
these influences,
goes as follows:

00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:03.354
Early Marxist and formalist
methods in common conceive the

00:16:03.354 --> 00:16:07.128
literary fact within the closed
circle of an aesthetics of

00:16:07.128 --> 00:16:09.379
production and representation.
 

00:16:09.379 --> 00:16:12.101
In doing so,
they deprive literature of a

00:16:12.101 --> 00:16:15.504
dimension that inalienably
belongs to its aesthetic

00:16:15.504 --> 00:16:18.840
character as well as to its
social function,

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:22.350
the dimension of its reception
and influence.

00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:24.190
In other words,
the way in which a text,

00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:27.710
once it exists,
moves in the world,

00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:32.765
the way in which it persists,
changes as we understand it and

00:16:32.765 --> 00:16:36.726
grows or diminishes as time
passes in the world:

00:16:36.726 --> 00:16:40.364
this is the medium,
the social medium,

00:16:40.364 --> 00:16:44.490
in which Jauss wants to
understand literary--

00:16:44.490 --> 00:16:46.820
precisely
literary--interpretation,

00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:47.990
as we'll see.
 

00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:51.948
Coming a little closer to this
issue of the relationship

00:16:51.948 --> 00:16:56.340
between thinking of this kind
and the formalist tradition,

00:16:56.340 --> 00:17:01.364
Bakhtin on page 592,
the left-hand column toward the

00:17:01.364 --> 00:17:03.403
bottom--
I'm not going to quote this,

00:17:03.403 --> 00:17:04.910
I'm just going to say that it's
there--

00:17:04.910 --> 00:17:09.088
Bakhtin begins a sentence
about, as he puts it,

00:17:09.088 --> 00:17:14.410
literary "parody"
understood in the narrow sense.

00:17:14.410 --> 00:17:18.676
Now what he's implying here is
that the theory of parody

00:17:18.676 --> 00:17:22.244
belongs primarily to Russian
formalist literary

00:17:22.244 --> 00:17:23.720
historiography.
 

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:27.064
In other words,
the relationship between a new

00:17:27.064 --> 00:17:31.523
text and an old text is one of,
broadly conceived within this

00:17:31.523 --> 00:17:33.160
discourse, parody.
 

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:41.146
Bakhtin picks up the word
"parody"

00:17:41.146 --> 00:17:52.105
in order to say also on page
592, the left-hand column about

00:17:52.105 --> 00:17:56.163
halfway down:
… [A]

00:17:56.163 --> 00:17:59.788
mere concern for language is
[and it's an odd thing to say,

00:17:59.788 --> 00:18:02.534
"a mere concern for
language"

00:18:02.534 --> 00:18:04.123
&gt;
 

00:18:04.123 --> 00:18:06.218
]
but the abstract side of the

00:18:06.218 --> 00:18:10.259
concrete and active [i.e.,
dialogically engaged]

00:18:10.259 --> 00:18:14.704
understanding of the living
heteroglossia that has been

00:18:14.704 --> 00:18:19.480
introduced into the novel and
artistically organized within

00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:20.140
it.
 

00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:23.588
To pause over this,
"parody":

00:18:23.588 --> 00:18:28.400
if we linger merely on the
literariness of parody,

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:35.078
we simply don't have any grasp
of the complexity of the ways in

00:18:35.078 --> 00:18:40.788
which the dialogic or the
heteroglossal modulates,

00:18:40.788 --> 00:18:45.656
ripples, and makes complicated
the surface of literary

00:18:45.656 --> 00:18:46.759
discourse.
 

00:18:46.759 --> 00:18:51.336
Parody once again leaves us
with a sense of the binary:

00:18:51.336 --> 00:18:56.814
the previous text was this,
the secondary text or the next

00:18:56.814 --> 00:19:02.486
text riffs off that previous
text in a way that we can call

00:19:02.486 --> 00:19:04.730
parodic--
but that's binary.

00:19:04.730 --> 00:19:09.867
It's one text against another
and leaves out the whole

00:19:09.867 --> 00:19:15.007
question of that flood or
multiplicity of voices which

00:19:15.007 --> 00:19:17.140
pervades the text.
 

00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:19.170
Okay.
 

00:19:19.170 --> 00:19:24.380
So then Jauss has an
interesting moment again,

00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:27.538
in the fourth passage on your
sheet,

00:19:27.538 --> 00:19:31.257
in which he is obviously
directly responding to that

00:19:31.257 --> 00:19:35.557
passage at the end of Tynjanov's
essay on literary evolution

00:19:35.557 --> 00:19:40.368
which we've had on the board and
which we've discussed before.

00:19:40.368 --> 00:19:44.318
You remember Tynjanov makes the
distinction between evolution--

00:19:44.318 --> 00:19:48.460
the way in which a sequence of
texts mutates,

00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:50.380
as one might say,
and the way in which,

00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:55.053
in other words,
successive texts (again) parody

00:19:55.053 --> 00:19:59.318
or alter what was in the
previous text--

00:19:59.318 --> 00:20:03.797
and modification,
which is the influence on texts

00:20:03.797 --> 00:20:09.580
from the outside by other sorts
of historical factors which may

00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:12.098
lead to textual change.
 

00:20:12.098 --> 00:20:14.930
Tynjanov says that it's
important,

00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:18.192
actually for both studies--for
the study of history and also

00:20:18.192 --> 00:20:20.240
for the study of literary
history--

00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:25.705
that the two be always kept
clearly distinct in the mind of

00:20:25.705 --> 00:20:28.440
the person looking at them.
 

00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:32.420
Well, Jauss's response to that
is perhaps chiefly rhetorical,

00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:36.369
but it nevertheless once again
does mark this shift in the

00:20:36.369 --> 00:20:40.597
direction of the understanding
of language as social that I've

00:20:40.597 --> 00:20:43.440
been wanting to begin by
emphasizing.

00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:46.855
Jauss says:
The connection between literary

00:20:46.855 --> 00:20:49.818
evolution and social change
[that is to say,

00:20:49.818 --> 00:20:55.688
those features in society that
would and do modify texts]

00:20:55.688 --> 00:21:01.767
does not vanish from the face
of the earth through its mere

00:21:01.767 --> 00:21:03.130
negation.
 

00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:04.210
What is he saying?
 

00:21:04.210 --> 00:21:06.807
He's saying "does not
vanish from the face of the

00:21:06.807 --> 00:21:09.259
earth" because Tynjanov
said it did.

00:21:09.259 --> 00:21:10.400
&gt;
 

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:15.223
There is no doubt that that's
the passage Jauss is talking

00:21:15.223 --> 00:21:18.355
about.]
The new literary work [he goes

00:21:18.355 --> 00:21:21.148
on]
is received and judged against

00:21:21.148 --> 00:21:25.890
the background of the everyday
experience of life.

00:21:25.890 --> 00:21:28.373
In other words,
the work exists in a life

00:21:28.373 --> 00:21:28.868
world.
 

00:21:28.868 --> 00:21:33.444
There is no easy or even
possible way of distinguishing

00:21:33.444 --> 00:21:38.529
between its formal innovations
and those sorts of innovations

00:21:38.529 --> 00:21:43.698
which are produced by continuous
and ongoing factors of social

00:21:43.698 --> 00:21:44.799
change.
 

00:21:44.799 --> 00:21:46.019
They interact.
 

00:21:46.019 --> 00:21:51.199
They seep into one another in
exactly the same way that all

00:21:51.199 --> 00:21:56.557
the registers and sedimentations
of human voices interact and

00:21:56.557 --> 00:22:01.289
seep into one another in
Bakhtin's heteroglossia.

00:22:01.289 --> 00:22:02.009
All right.
 

00:22:02.009 --> 00:22:06.247
So these then are the emphases
of both of these writers with

00:22:06.247 --> 00:22:10.770
respect to formalist ideas which
have played a prominent part in

00:22:10.770 --> 00:22:14.432
most,
if not all, of the literary

00:22:14.432 --> 00:22:19.009
theory that we have studied up
until now.

00:22:19.009 --> 00:22:24.285
I'd like to linger a little
while with Bakhtin before

00:22:24.285 --> 00:22:26.720
turning back to Jauss.
 

00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:29.940
Now heteroglossia or diversity
of speech,

00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:35.075
as he calls it sometimes--he
says at one point again on page

00:22:35.075 --> 00:22:39.078
592 toward the top of the
left-hand column--

00:22:39.078 --> 00:22:43.880
heteroglossia is what he calls
"the ground of style."

00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:47.721
I want to pause to ask a little
bit what he might mean by this

00:22:47.721 --> 00:22:51.374
expression, "the ground of
style," the italicized

00:22:51.374 --> 00:22:52.130
passage.
 

00:22:52.130 --> 00:22:56.634
It is precisely the diversity
of speech and not the unity of a

00:22:56.634 --> 00:23:00.769
normative shared language that
is the ground of style.

00:23:00.769 --> 00:23:02.888
In other words,
I've already said,

00:23:02.888 --> 00:23:06.807
of course, when I speak I'm not
speaking to you in an official

00:23:06.807 --> 00:23:07.450
voice.
 

00:23:07.450 --> 00:23:11.650
I am not speaking the King's
English.

00:23:11.650 --> 00:23:15.384
In fact, on this view there's
really no such thing as the

00:23:15.384 --> 00:23:16.519
King's English.
 

00:23:16.519 --> 00:23:21.412
Nobody speaks the King's
English because there is no such

00:23:21.412 --> 00:23:25.778
isolated distilled entity that
one can point to.

00:23:25.778 --> 00:23:29.750
Language, at least the language
of most of us--

00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:33.531
that is to say,
of everyone except people in

00:23:33.531 --> 00:23:37.140
hermetically sealed environments
like,

00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:41.259
for example,
a peculiarly privileged,

00:23:41.259 --> 00:23:47.016
inward-looking aristocracy--the
language of virtually all of us

00:23:47.016 --> 00:23:52.338
is the language of the people,
the language of others.

00:23:52.338 --> 00:23:57.854
It is that which we have to
continue to think about as we

00:23:57.854 --> 00:24:01.400
consider how a style is
generated.

00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:07.655
We speak of a style as though
it were purely a question of an

00:24:07.655 --> 00:24:09.950
authorial signature.
 

00:24:09.950 --> 00:24:13.960
Sometimes we think of style and
signature as synonymous.

00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:16.630
"Oh, I would recognize
that style anywhere."

00:24:16.630 --> 00:24:20.400
Coleridge said of a few lines
of Wordsworth,

00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:22.548
"If I had come across
these lines in the desert,

00:24:22.548 --> 00:24:23.964
I'd have said
'Wordsworth.'"

00:24:23.964 --> 00:24:26.266
Well,
obviously there is a certain

00:24:26.266 --> 00:24:30.019
sense in which we do recognize a
style: for example,

00:24:30.019 --> 00:24:31.759
the style of Jane Austen.
 

00:24:31.759 --> 00:24:34.770
[Points to quotation on board.]
I suppose arguably you could

00:24:34.770 --> 00:24:36.506
think that this is the style of
Dr.

00:24:36.506 --> 00:24:39.428
Johnson,
but most people would recognize

00:24:39.428 --> 00:24:43.259
it as the style of Jane Austen;
and yet at the same time,

00:24:43.259 --> 00:24:46.354
as we'll see in a minute,
it is a style made up,

00:24:46.354 --> 00:24:50.105
in ways that are very difficult
finally to factor out and

00:24:50.105 --> 00:24:53.170
analyze,
of many voices.

00:24:53.170 --> 00:24:54.548
Okay.
 

00:24:54.548 --> 00:24:59.887
So this would suggest,
I think--this idea of a style

00:24:59.887 --> 00:25:04.390
as a composite of speech
sedimentations--

00:25:04.390 --> 00:25:08.470
this idea would suggest that
possibly there isn't a voice,

00:25:08.470 --> 00:25:13.768
that to speak of an authorial
voice would be a very difficult

00:25:13.768 --> 00:25:18.885
matter and might lead us to ask,
"Does this move the idea

00:25:18.885 --> 00:25:22.308
that the sociolect speaks
through the idiolect,

00:25:22.308 --> 00:25:26.220
the idea that the language of
everyone is,

00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:29.900
in fact, the language that
speaks my speech,

00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:34.440
my peculiar individual
speech--does this once again

00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:38.799
bring us face to face with that
dreary topic,

00:25:38.799 --> 00:25:40.910
the death of the author?"
 

00:25:40.910 --> 00:25:44.750
I don't think so,
not quite, and certainly not in

00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:48.029
Bakhtin,
who gives us a rather bracing

00:25:48.029 --> 00:25:53.410
sense of the importance of the
author in a passage on page 593,

00:25:53.410 --> 00:25:55.160
the right-hand column.
 

00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:57.798
He says:
It is as if the author [this

00:25:57.798 --> 00:26:01.051
is, of course,
sort of coming face-to-face

00:26:01.051 --> 00:26:05.198
with the problem of whether
there still is an author]

00:26:05.198 --> 00:26:10.357
has no language of his own,
but does possess his own style,

00:26:10.357 --> 00:26:15.734
his own organic and unitary law
governing the way he plays with

00:26:15.734 --> 00:26:20.332
languages [so style is perhaps
one's particular way of

00:26:20.332 --> 00:26:25.536
mediating and allocating the
diversity of voice that impinges

00:26:25.536 --> 00:26:29.438
on what one's saying]
and the way his own real

00:26:29.438 --> 00:26:34.122
semantic and expressive
intentions are refracted within

00:26:34.122 --> 00:26:35.509
them.
 

00:26:35.509 --> 00:26:40.231
[And here Bakhtin saves or
preserves the author by invoking

00:26:40.231 --> 00:26:44.711
the principle of unifying
intention and the way in which

00:26:44.711 --> 00:26:49.270
we can recognize it in the
discourse of any given novel.]

00:26:49.270 --> 00:26:53.586
Of course this play with
languages (and frequently the

00:26:53.586 --> 00:26:58.065
complete absence of a direct
discourse of his own) in no

00:26:58.065 --> 00:27:03.433
sense degrades the general,
deep-seated intentionality,

00:27:03.433 --> 00:27:08.403
the overarching ideological
conceptualization of the work as

00:27:08.403 --> 00:27:09.328
a whole.
 

00:27:09.328 --> 00:27:11.938
So this is not,
though it may seem to be in

00:27:11.938 --> 00:27:16.028
certain respects,
a question of the death of the

00:27:16.028 --> 00:27:20.461
author as provoked by,
let's say, Foucault or Roland

00:27:20.461 --> 00:27:23.579
Barthes at the beginning of the
semester.

00:27:23.579 --> 00:27:28.058
It's not that exactly.
 

00:27:28.058 --> 00:27:31.665
Everything that we've been
saying so far can be seen to

00:27:31.665 --> 00:27:33.670
work in a variety of novels.
 

00:27:33.670 --> 00:27:36.818
The novel is the privileged
genre for Bakhtin.

00:27:36.818 --> 00:27:41.230
He, I think perhaps somewhat
oversimplifying in this,

00:27:41.230 --> 00:27:44.130
reads the novel,
the emergence of the novel,

00:27:44.130 --> 00:27:48.334
and the flowering and richness
of the novel against the

00:27:48.334 --> 00:27:52.148
backdrop of genres he considers
to be monoglossal:

00:27:52.148 --> 00:27:55.585
the epic,
which simply speaks the unitary

00:27:55.585 --> 00:27:58.308
voice of an aristocratic
tradition;

00:27:58.308 --> 00:28:03.394
the lyric, which simply speaks
the unitary voice of the

00:28:03.394 --> 00:28:06.220
isolated romantic solipsist.
 

00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:10.705
Over against that,
you get the polyglossal,

00:28:10.705 --> 00:28:15.618
the rich multiplicity of voice
in the novel.

00:28:15.618 --> 00:28:19.664
As I say, I think that the
generic contrast is somewhat

00:28:19.664 --> 00:28:24.085
oversimplified because nothing
is easier and more profitable

00:28:24.085 --> 00:28:27.980
than to read both epic and lyric
as manifestations of

00:28:27.980 --> 00:28:29.480
heteroglossia.
 

00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:30.578
Just think of The Iliad.
 

00:28:30.578 --> 00:28:33.609
What are you going to do,
if you really believe that it's

00:28:33.609 --> 00:28:36.099
monoglossal, with the speeches
of Thersites?

00:28:36.099 --> 00:28:38.170
Okay.
 

00:28:38.170 --> 00:28:40.897
In any case,
the basic idea,

00:28:40.897 --> 00:28:44.482
however,
is I think extraordinarily rich

00:28:44.482 --> 00:28:47.659
and important,
and I thought we could try it

00:28:47.659 --> 00:28:51.391
out by taking a look for a
moment at the first sentence of

00:28:51.391 --> 00:28:54.010
Pride and Prejudice,
which I'm sure most of you

00:28:54.010 --> 00:28:54.750
know [gestures to board,
 

00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:01.307
It is plainly an example of the
relationship between what

00:29:01.307 --> 00:29:04.608
Bakhtin calls "common
language"--

00:29:04.608 --> 00:29:05.912
"It is a truth universally
acknowledged,"

00:29:05.912 --> 00:29:06.848
or in other
&gt;

00:29:06.848 --> 00:29:14.506
words, it's in everybody's
mouth--and something like

00:29:14.506 --> 00:29:19.691
authorial reflection,
or what he elsewhere calls

00:29:19.691 --> 00:29:22.430
"internally persuasive
discourse."

00:29:22.430 --> 00:29:27.088
Now in traditional parlance,
this would be a speech which

00:29:27.088 --> 00:29:31.144
manifests irony,
the rhetoric of irony against

00:29:31.144 --> 00:29:36.519
which Bakhtin sets himself in
the first passage on your sheet.

00:29:36.519 --> 00:29:39.096
"How ridiculous!"
 

00:29:39.096 --> 00:29:39.858
we say.
 

00:29:39.858 --> 00:29:43.170
Jane Austen doesn't believe
this.

00:29:43.170 --> 00:29:47.540
This is drawing-room wisdom,
and everything in her sentence

00:29:47.540 --> 00:29:51.460
points to the ways in which it's
obviously wrong,

00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:56.001
even while it's being called a
truth: "universally"

00:29:56.001 --> 00:29:59.558
meaning the thousand people or
so who matter;

00:29:59.558 --> 00:30:00.278
in other words,
&gt;

00:30:00.278 --> 00:30:05.943
there are a great many people
who neither acknowledge nor care

00:30:05.943 --> 00:30:08.078
about any such thing.
 

00:30:08.078 --> 00:30:11.172
Then, of course,
the idea that "a single

00:30:11.172 --> 00:30:14.053
man in possession of a good
fortune,"

00:30:14.053 --> 00:30:18.990
or indeed otherwise,
has nothing to do but be

00:30:18.990 --> 00:30:23.098
"in want of a wife."
 

00:30:23.098 --> 00:30:30.640
Obviously, this is what is
being said not by the man in the

00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:35.450
street but by drawing-room
culture.

00:30:35.450 --> 00:30:39.756
Now even before we turn to the
complication of the ways in

00:30:39.756 --> 00:30:42.930
which the sentence is being
undermined,

00:30:42.930 --> 00:30:47.986
bear in mind that the plot of
the novel confirms the

00:30:47.986 --> 00:30:49.730
"truth."
 

00:30:49.730 --> 00:30:51.974
In other words,
Darcy and Bingley,

00:30:51.974 --> 00:30:54.765
both of them "in
possession of a good

00:30:54.765 --> 00:30:57.555
fortune,"
do turn out very plainly to

00:30:57.555 --> 00:31:02.400
have been in want of a wife and,
in fact, procure one by the end

00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:03.390
of the novel.
 

00:31:03.390 --> 00:31:06.088
That is precisely what the plot
is about,

00:31:06.088 --> 00:31:10.144
so that the conventions
governing the plot of Pride

00:31:10.144 --> 00:31:14.201
and Prejudice altogether
confirm the truth that is

00:31:14.201 --> 00:31:18.041
announced in this sentence,
even though it is a

00:31:18.041 --> 00:31:20.558
truth that is plainly to be
viewed ironically.

00:31:20.558 --> 00:31:23.655
That in itself is quite
extraordinary and,

00:31:23.655 --> 00:31:28.036
I think, reinforces our sense
that this is one of the great

00:31:28.036 --> 00:31:31.509
first sentences in the history
of fiction.

00:31:31.509 --> 00:31:34.827
Let's turn now to the way in
which we can think of it as

00:31:34.827 --> 00:31:37.118
something other than a simple
irony.

00:31:37.118 --> 00:31:40.338
Of course, there is this word
"want."

00:31:40.338 --> 00:31:43.997
We've been thinking a lot about
want lately because we have just

00:31:43.997 --> 00:31:46.318
gone through our psychoanalytic
phase.

00:31:46.318 --> 00:31:50.920
What exactly does this
&gt;

00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:54.818
single man really want?
 

00:31:54.818 --> 00:31:58.538
In a way, the subtle pun in the
word "want,"

00:31:58.538 --> 00:32:02.047
which means both "to
desire" and "to

00:32:02.047 --> 00:32:04.438
lack"--
well, if I lack something,

00:32:04.438 --> 00:32:05.950
I don't necessarily desire it.
 

00:32:05.950 --> 00:32:08.380
I just don't happen to have it,
right?

00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:10.991
On the other hand,
if I want something,

00:32:10.991 --> 00:32:13.329
I can also be said to desire
it.

00:32:13.329 --> 00:32:16.548
Well, which is it?
 

00:32:16.548 --> 00:32:23.162
Is it a kind of lack that
social pressure of some sort is

00:32:23.162 --> 00:32:27.650
calculated to fill,
or is it desire?

00:32:27.650 --> 00:32:29.963
If it's desire,
what on earth does it have to

00:32:29.963 --> 00:32:31.278
do with a good fortune?
 

00:32:31.278 --> 00:32:34.938
There are elements of the
romance plot which raise

00:32:34.938 --> 00:32:36.880
precisely that question.
 

00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:40.640
Desire has nothing to do with
fortune.

00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:42.759
Convenience,
social acceptability,

00:32:42.759 --> 00:32:46.358
comfort: all of those things
have to do with fortune,

00:32:46.358 --> 00:32:49.740
but desire, we suppose--having
passed through our

00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:53.529
psychoanalytic phase--
to be of a somewhat different

00:32:53.529 --> 00:32:54.108
nature.
 

00:32:54.108 --> 00:32:58.086
The complication of the
sentence has to do actually with

00:32:58.086 --> 00:33:02.640
the question of the way in which
the meanings of these words can

00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:07.049
be thought to be circulating and
to create ripples of irony of

00:33:07.049 --> 00:33:10.808
their own far more complicated
than "Oh,

00:33:10.808 --> 00:33:13.380
the author's much smarter than
that,

00:33:13.380 --> 00:33:17.169
she doesn't mean that,"
which is already a complication

00:33:17.169 --> 00:33:20.509
introduced by the fact that her
plot bears it out.

00:33:20.509 --> 00:33:23.509
How can her plot bear it out if
she's being so ironic?

00:33:23.509 --> 00:33:33.368
Of course, there is obviously a
good deal more to say.

00:33:33.368 --> 00:33:37.911
A single man in possession of a
good fortune obviously may not

00:33:37.911 --> 00:33:41.508
at all want a wife,
for a variety of reasons that

00:33:41.508 --> 00:33:44.248
one could mention,
and that can't be possibly

00:33:44.248 --> 00:33:47.140
completely absent from Jane
Austen's mind.

00:33:47.140 --> 00:33:54.285
So that has to be taken into
account in itself and certainly

00:33:54.285 --> 00:33:59.130
does [lights go off in lecture
hall]--

00:34:26.969 --> 00:34:34.402
I think you see it's the sort
of sentence that bears

00:34:34.402 --> 00:34:43.001
reflection beyond a kind of
simple binary of the sentence as

00:34:43.001 --> 00:34:49.268
spoken by the man in the drawing
room,

00:34:49.268 --> 00:34:51.130
or the woman in the drawing
room.

00:34:51.130 --> 00:34:54.980
"It's idiotic,
it's obviously wrong--

00:34:54.980 --> 00:35:00.664
we simply can't say that":
the style of the author is a

00:35:00.664 --> 00:35:05.867
style that is sedimented by and
through complexities of

00:35:05.867 --> 00:35:11.842
circulated meaning that really
can't be limited by any sense of

00:35:11.842 --> 00:35:15.599
one-to-one relation of that
kind.

00:35:15.599 --> 00:35:47.909
&gt;
 

00:35:47.909 --> 00:35:53.280
All right.
 

00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:54.539
What else about Bakhtin?
 

00:35:54.539 --> 00:35:58.768
One more thing:
His idea of common language.

00:35:58.768 --> 00:36:04.050
This is not a concept that is
supposed to have any one

00:36:04.050 --> 00:36:07.440
particular value attached to it.
 

00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:10.260
It's a little bit like the
rhizome.

00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:13.260
It could be good;
it could be bad.

00:36:13.260 --> 00:36:17.050
Common language could be a kind
of Rabelaisan,

00:36:17.050 --> 00:36:21.672
carnivalesque,
subversive, energetic body of

00:36:21.672 --> 00:36:28.233
voices from below overturning
the apple carts of authority and

00:36:28.233 --> 00:36:33.179
the fixed ways of a moribund
social order.

00:36:33.179 --> 00:36:36.824
It could be that,
but at the same time it could

00:36:36.824 --> 00:36:40.311
itself be the authoritative,
the reactionary,

00:36:40.311 --> 00:36:41.659
the mindless.
 

00:36:41.659 --> 00:36:46.735
Common language could be that
universality of acknowledgement

00:36:46.735 --> 00:36:50.460
which seems to go along with
unreflected,

00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:55.900
knee-jerk responses to what one
observes and thinks about.

00:36:55.900 --> 00:36:58.889
Common language has that whole
range.

00:36:58.889 --> 00:37:04.192
The important thing about it is
that it's out there and that it

00:37:04.192 --> 00:37:09.065
circulates and it exists in
relationship with what Bakhtin

00:37:09.065 --> 00:37:13.768
calls "internally
persuasive discourse"--

00:37:13.768 --> 00:37:18.228
in other words,
the way in which the filtering

00:37:18.228 --> 00:37:24.371
together of these various sorts
of language result in something

00:37:24.371 --> 00:37:28.335
like what we feel to be
authentic:

00:37:28.335 --> 00:37:35.420
a power of reflection,
a posing of relations among the

00:37:35.420 --> 00:37:41.652
various strata of language,
such that they can speak

00:37:41.652 --> 00:37:45.445
authentically,
not necessarily in a way that

00:37:45.445 --> 00:37:50.291
we agree with but in a way that
we recognize to constitute that

00:37:50.291 --> 00:37:54.510
distilled consciousness that we
still do call "the

00:37:54.510 --> 00:37:57.949
author,"
and to which we ascribe,

00:37:57.949 --> 00:38:02.199
in some sense, authority.
 

00:38:02.199 --> 00:38:05.956
Precisely in the peculiar
self-mocking relationship

00:38:05.956 --> 00:38:10.016
between this sentence of
Pride and Prejudice and

00:38:10.016 --> 00:38:14.150
the plot of Pride and
Prejudice as a whole,

00:38:14.150 --> 00:38:18.949
we feel something like the
internal persuasiveness,

00:38:18.949 --> 00:38:23.610
the coherence of the discourse.
 

00:38:23.610 --> 00:38:26.599
I think, maybe just to sum up
Bakhtin,

00:38:26.599 --> 00:38:31.748
I want to quote you from the
other long excerpt that you have

00:38:31.748 --> 00:38:35.141
in your anthology,
which I would encourage you to

00:38:35.141 --> 00:38:35.460
read.
 

00:38:35.460 --> 00:38:38.280
Sometimes I have asked people
to read it but I decided to drop

00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:40.918
it this year--but it's still a
very strong and interesting

00:38:40.918 --> 00:38:41.518
argument.
 

00:38:41.518 --> 00:38:43.956
It's called "Discourse in
the Novel,"

00:38:43.956 --> 00:38:46.659
and I just want to read in the
left-hand column,

00:38:46.659 --> 00:38:51.257
near the bottom of the column:
"The ideological becoming

00:38:51.257 --> 00:38:55.704
of a human being in this view is
the process of selectively

00:38:55.704 --> 00:38:59.000
assimilating the words of
others."

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:01.750
In other words,
the coherence of my mind,

00:39:01.750 --> 00:39:04.309
of what I say insofar as
coherence exists,

00:39:04.309 --> 00:39:09.920
is the result of selecting out,
of selecting among,

00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:12.989
in my assimilation of the words
of others,

00:39:12.989 --> 00:39:17.960
such that there is a pattern
of, again, coherence.

00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:19.480
All right.
 

00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:22.498
So finally, the novel is the
social text par

00:39:22.498 --> 00:39:25.650
excellence for Bakhtin for
these reasons,

00:39:25.650 --> 00:39:29.800
and it confirms again what we
have been saying about a new way

00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:31.570
of thinking of language.
 

00:39:31.570 --> 00:39:36.820
Language, as that which speaks
through us, is not just

00:39:36.820 --> 00:39:40.824
language;
it's other people's language,

00:39:40.824 --> 00:39:46.556
and we need to understand the
experience of the process of

00:39:46.556 --> 00:39:51.684
reading and of texts as they
exist and the nature of

00:39:51.684 --> 00:39:56.409
authorial composition as an
assimilative,

00:39:56.409 --> 00:40:01.320
selective way of putting
together other people's

00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:02.469
language.
 

00:40:02.469 --> 00:40:03.440
All right.
 

00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:05.860
Now quickly Jauss.
 

00:40:05.860 --> 00:40:10.429
He takes us back,
obviously by way of Iser--

00:40:10.429 --> 00:40:14.577
I think you can see that
Jauss's talk about horizons of

00:40:14.577 --> 00:40:19.262
expectation and the disruption
of expectation has a great deal

00:40:19.262 --> 00:40:23.795
to do with Iser's understanding
of the role of the reader in

00:40:23.795 --> 00:40:28.250
filling imaginative gaps that
are left in the text,

00:40:28.250 --> 00:40:32.719
which are based on a complex
relationship with a set of

00:40:32.719 --> 00:40:37.170
conventional expectations--
by way of Iser to Gadamer;

00:40:37.170 --> 00:40:41.067
because after all,
what Jauss has to say is a way

00:40:41.067 --> 00:40:45.940
of talking about Gadamer's
"merger of horizons."

00:40:45.940 --> 00:40:50.237
But for Jauss it's not just my
horizon and the horizon of the

00:40:50.237 --> 00:40:50.739
text.
 

00:40:50.739 --> 00:40:55.813
It's not just those two
horizons that need to meet

00:40:55.813 --> 00:41:01.199
halfway on common ground as
mutually illuminative.

00:41:01.199 --> 00:41:05.590
It is, in fact,
a succession of horizons

00:41:05.590 --> 00:41:12.123
changing as modes of aesthetic
and interpretive response to

00:41:12.123 --> 00:41:16.289
texts are mediated
historically--

00:41:16.289 --> 00:41:19.090
as I say--in a sequence.
 

00:41:19.090 --> 00:41:23.295
It's not just that the text was
once a certain thing and now we

00:41:23.295 --> 00:41:27.860
feel it to be somehow different,
hence in order to understand it

00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:29.840
we need to meet it halfway.
 

00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:34.210
It's rather a matter of
self-consciously studying what

00:41:34.210 --> 00:41:38.168
has happened in between that
other time and this,

00:41:38.168 --> 00:41:39.570
here and now.
 

00:41:39.570 --> 00:41:41.630
The text has had a life.
 

00:41:41.630 --> 00:41:44.579
It has passed through life
changes,

00:41:44.579 --> 00:41:50.585
and these life changes have to
be understood at each successive

00:41:50.585 --> 00:41:56.400
stage in terms of the three
moments of hermeneutic grasp,

00:41:56.400 --> 00:42:01.175
as described by Gadamer in the
historical section of Truth

00:42:01.175 --> 00:42:02.210
and Method.
 

00:42:02.210 --> 00:42:04.510
The distinction between
intelligere,

00:42:04.510 --> 00:42:07.170
explicare,
and applicare--

00:42:07.170 --> 00:42:09.585
understanding,
interpretation,

00:42:09.585 --> 00:42:13.054
and application--
that Jauss talks about at the

00:42:13.054 --> 00:42:16.824
beginning of his essay actually
goes back to the eighteenth

00:42:16.824 --> 00:42:17.539
century.
 

00:42:17.539 --> 00:42:19.789
What Jauss has to say about it
is,

00:42:19.789 --> 00:42:24.943
yes: these three moments of
hermeneutic understanding exist

00:42:24.943 --> 00:42:30.541
for any reader or reading public
at any moment in the history of

00:42:30.541 --> 00:42:33.030
the reception of a text.
 

00:42:33.030 --> 00:42:38.568
He makes a considerable to-do
about distinguishing between the

00:42:38.568 --> 00:42:44.289
aesthetic response to the text
and a subsequent or leisured,

00:42:44.289 --> 00:42:48.630
reflectively interpretive
response to the text.

00:42:48.630 --> 00:42:51.682
This may seem a little
confusing because he admits with

00:42:51.682 --> 00:42:55.800
Heidegger and others,
as we've indicated ourselves in

00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:59.324
the past,
that you can't just have a

00:42:59.324 --> 00:43:04.510
spontaneous response to anything
without reflection.

00:43:04.510 --> 00:43:06.965
There's always a sense in which
you already know what it is,

00:43:06.965 --> 00:43:09.378
which is to say a sense in
which you've already interpreted

00:43:09.378 --> 00:43:11.061
it;
but at the same time,

00:43:11.061 --> 00:43:14.840
Jauss makes a considerable
point of distinguishing between

00:43:14.840 --> 00:43:17.039
these two moments--
the aesthetic,

00:43:17.039 --> 00:43:19.210
which he associates with
understanding,

00:43:19.210 --> 00:43:23.260
and the interpretive,
which he associates with what

00:43:23.260 --> 00:43:27.800
is in the hermeneutic tradition
called interpretation.

00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:29.880
Now why does he do this?
 

00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:32.356
It's a question of what he
means by "the

00:43:32.356 --> 00:43:33.369
aesthetic."
 

00:43:33.369 --> 00:43:39.498
A text enters historical
circulation and remains before

00:43:39.498 --> 00:43:46.534
the gaze of successive audiences
in history because it has been

00:43:46.534 --> 00:43:49.599
received aesthetically.
 

00:43:49.599 --> 00:43:53.965
Aesthetics is the glue that
keeps the text alive through

00:43:53.965 --> 00:43:54.760
history.
 

00:43:54.760 --> 00:43:57.056
In other words,
people continue to say,

00:43:57.056 --> 00:44:00.079
to one degree or another,
"I like it."

00:44:00.079 --> 00:44:02.480
If they don't say,
"I like it,"

00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:05.360
there will never be a question
of interpreting it

00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:06.920
&gt;
 

00:44:06.920 --> 00:44:08.722
or transmitting it
historically,

00:44:08.722 --> 00:44:10.699
because it's going to
disappear.

00:44:10.699 --> 00:44:11.128
As Dr.
 

00:44:11.128 --> 00:44:14.278
Johnson said,
"That book is good in vain

00:44:14.278 --> 00:44:17.000
which the reader throws
away."

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:19.289
In other words,
from the standpoint of

00:44:19.289 --> 00:44:22.568
interpretation or from the
standpoint of philosophical

00:44:22.568 --> 00:44:25.909
reflection or whatever you might
wish to call it,

00:44:25.909 --> 00:44:30.389
a book may be good,
just incontestably good--

00:44:30.389 --> 00:44:35.250
but if it didn't please,
if it didn't give pleasure,

00:44:35.250 --> 00:44:41.442
if it didn't attach itself to a
reading public aesthetically by

00:44:41.442 --> 00:44:46.396
means of pleasing,
none of what would follow in

00:44:46.396 --> 00:44:51.190
the hermeneutic process could
ever take place.

00:44:51.190 --> 00:44:55.480
So that's why Jauss makes such
a point of distinguishing

00:44:55.480 --> 00:44:58.989
between the aesthetic and the
interpretive.

00:44:58.989 --> 00:45:04.844
Then of course the historical
study of reception is what shows

00:45:04.844 --> 00:45:10.315
us the degree to which any set
of moments of aesthetic and

00:45:10.315 --> 00:45:15.786
interpretive reception is
mediated by what has gone before

00:45:15.786 --> 00:45:16.650
it.
 

00:45:16.650 --> 00:45:20.318
In other words,
a text gradually changes as a

00:45:20.318 --> 00:45:23.952
result of its reception,
and if we don't study

00:45:23.952 --> 00:45:27.900
reception, we are left naively
supposing that time has passed

00:45:27.900 --> 00:45:31.586
and that the past has become
sort of remote from us so we

00:45:31.586 --> 00:45:34.219
have certain problems
interpreting;

00:45:34.219 --> 00:45:37.172
but these problems as far as we
know haven't arisen from

00:45:37.172 --> 00:45:39.750
anything that could properly be
called change.

00:45:39.750 --> 00:45:43.851
There has been an unfolding
process of successive

00:45:43.851 --> 00:45:48.894
interpretations whereby a text
has gone through sea changes:

00:45:48.894 --> 00:45:52.427
it's become less popular,
more popular,

00:45:52.427 --> 00:45:56.449
more richly interpreted and
less richly interpreted,

00:45:56.449 --> 00:46:01.362
but tends to keep eddying out
from what it was sensed to be

00:46:01.362 --> 00:46:05.257
originally,
to the point where all sorts of

00:46:05.257 --> 00:46:10.150
accretive implications and
sources of pleasure may arrive

00:46:10.150 --> 00:46:12.159
as we understand it.
 

00:46:12.159 --> 00:46:14.166
In a certain sense,
once again it's like

00:46:14.166 --> 00:46:16.237
"Pierre Menard,
Author of the

00:46:16.237 --> 00:46:19.585
Quixote,"
but now it's not just Pierre

00:46:19.585 --> 00:46:21.909
Menard and Miguel de Cervantes.
 

00:46:21.909 --> 00:46:23.739
It's as though a succession of
people,

00:46:23.739 --> 00:46:28.213
perhaps whose native language
was not French necessarily but

00:46:28.213 --> 00:46:30.418
who knows--
German, Russian,

00:46:30.418 --> 00:46:35.061
whatever--continued to write in
Spanish a text which turns out

00:46:35.061 --> 00:46:39.172
to be word-for-word Don
Quixote as the centuries

00:46:39.172 --> 00:46:43.059
pass,
each one acquiring a whole new

00:46:43.059 --> 00:46:48.853
world of associations and
implications and giving pleasure

00:46:48.853 --> 00:46:51.699
in successively new ways.
 

00:46:51.699 --> 00:46:54.956
When we finally get to the
point in the late nineteenth

00:46:54.956 --> 00:46:56.786
century,
when we encounter this

00:46:56.786 --> 00:47:00.074
Frenchman, Pierre Menard,
writing Don Quixote,

00:47:00.074 --> 00:47:03.659
the important thing would be
to understand that lots of

00:47:03.659 --> 00:47:06.690
people have done it between him
and Cervantes.

00:47:06.690 --> 00:47:12.869
This is a kind of skeletal
model of how a reception history

00:47:12.869 --> 00:47:16.280
according to Jauss might work.
 

00:47:16.280 --> 00:47:19.960
Now the history of reception
studies two things.

00:47:19.960 --> 00:47:24.289
It studies changing horizons of
expectation,

00:47:24.289 --> 00:47:27.369
and that's something you're
familiar with from Iser--

00:47:27.369 --> 00:47:30.416
that is to say,
the way in which a reader has

00:47:30.416 --> 00:47:33.465
to come to terms with
conventions surrounding

00:47:33.465 --> 00:47:37.791
expectation in any given text,
in order to be able to

00:47:37.791 --> 00:47:42.981
negotiate what's new and what's
nearly merely culinary in the

00:47:42.981 --> 00:47:45.668
text--
it involves changing horizons

00:47:45.668 --> 00:47:50.079
of expectations which don't just
change once in the here and now,

00:47:50.079 --> 00:47:53.050
but have changed successively
through time.

00:47:53.050 --> 00:47:57.860
It also involves changing
semantic possibilities or,

00:47:57.860 --> 00:48:01.536
if you will,
changing possibilities for and

00:48:01.536 --> 00:48:06.507
of significance--
what does the text mean for me

00:48:06.507 --> 00:48:08.806
now?--
but understood again not just

00:48:08.806 --> 00:48:10.650
as something that matters for
me,

00:48:10.650 --> 00:48:14.628
but has successively mattered
for successive generations of

00:48:14.628 --> 00:48:16.070
readers in between.
 

00:48:16.070 --> 00:48:20.726
Just to take examples of how
this might work in the here and

00:48:20.726 --> 00:48:23.865
now,
there is just now on Broadway a

00:48:23.865 --> 00:48:28.739
revival of Damn Yankees,
which is about a baseball

00:48:28.739 --> 00:48:33.489
player who sells his soul in
order to beat the Yankees.

00:48:33.489 --> 00:48:37.172
One can't help but think that
the revival of interest in

00:48:37.172 --> 00:48:40.853
Damn Yankees has
something to do with the steroid

00:48:40.853 --> 00:48:44.936
scandals and the way in which so
many baseball players do sell

00:48:44.936 --> 00:48:49.489
their souls in order to win and
in order to have good careers.

00:48:49.489 --> 00:48:54.108
It occurs to one that it is in
this sort of atmosphere of

00:48:54.108 --> 00:48:59.056
social and cultural censure that
we're suddenly interested in

00:48:59.056 --> 00:49:01.530
Damn Yankees again.
 

00:49:01.530 --> 00:49:05.547
Perhaps there will be a revival
of Tony the Tow Truck

00:49:05.547 --> 00:49:08.469
because in the economic
downturn,

00:49:08.469 --> 00:49:14.492
obviously to be rich or to be
glamorous like Neato or to be

00:49:14.492 --> 00:49:18.523
busy like Speedy--
all of this becomes obsolete,

00:49:18.523 --> 00:49:21.690
more or less irrelevant and
beside the point,

00:49:21.690 --> 00:49:25.659
and what really matters is
little guys helping each other.

00:49:25.659 --> 00:49:31.498
So Tony the Tow Truck
could be revived today as a

00:49:31.498 --> 00:49:36.170
parable of the good life in the
downturn,

00:49:36.170 --> 00:49:41.170
and so it will probably be read
by everyone,

00:49:41.170 --> 00:49:44.286
it will give pleasure,
it will therefore be

00:49:44.286 --> 00:49:47.454
interpreted,
and it will survive to live

00:49:47.454 --> 00:49:52.172
another day historically,
fulfilling the three moments of

00:49:52.172 --> 00:49:57.070
the study of the history of
reception required by Jauss.

00:49:57.070 --> 00:49:57.750
All right.
 

00:49:57.750 --> 00:50:00.423
So with that said,
it's been a very interesting

00:50:00.423 --> 00:50:01.820
fifty minutes I think.
 

00:50:01.820 --> 00:50:03.780
&gt;
 

00:50:03.780 --> 00:50:06.346
With that said,
I hope you all have a good

00:50:06.346 --> 00:50:09.099
break and we'll see you when you
get back.

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:07.420
Prof: I'm John Merriman
and this is History 202.

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:10.926
I'm here every Monday and
Wednesday, 10:30 a.m.

00:00:10.926 --> 00:00:12.070
to 11:20 a.m.
 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:14.705
The way this course is,
these are all really major

00:00:14.705 --> 00:00:15.190
themes.
 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:17.187
I'm going to go over this a
little bit, and I'm going to

00:00:17.187 --> 00:00:18.350
talk about some of the themes.
 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:22.038
I kind of lecture on things
that I think that complement

00:00:22.038 --> 00:00:23.380
what you're doing.
 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.070
Let me give you an example.
 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.750
When I talk about the New
Imperialism,

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:34.816
why it is that Europe basically
took over the entire world

00:00:34.816 --> 00:00:39.085
between the 1880s and 1914,
you can read the chapter in

00:00:39.085 --> 00:00:40.520
A History of Modern
Europe,

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.930
which I had fun writing,
but I lecture on the Boy Scouts.

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.706
I often say that I lecture on
the Boy Scouts because I was

00:00:47.706 --> 00:00:50.240
thrown out of the Boy Scouts in
Portland, Oregon,

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.522
when I was a kid,
because I didn't manage to

00:00:52.522 --> 00:00:56.282
accumulate a single badge and
was totally useless after sports

00:00:56.282 --> 00:00:57.330
seasons ended.
 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:58.640
But that's not why I do it.
 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.750
To understand the New
Imperialism,

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.569
why Europe took over
essentially all of Africa,

00:01:05.569 --> 00:01:08.652
where they had places that were
totally uncharted that suddenly

00:01:08.652 --> 00:01:10.790
became highly contested between
British,

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:16.489
French, German,
and Italian conquerors,

00:01:16.489 --> 00:01:19.590
one has to understand the
culture of imperialism.

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.397
The ordinance of the Boy Scouts
in Britain has a lot to do with

00:01:24.397 --> 00:01:24.938
that.
 

00:01:24.938 --> 00:01:27.462
Why generations of British
youth and their counterparts in

00:01:27.462 --> 00:01:29.686
Germany,
and even Australia,

00:01:29.686 --> 00:01:32.610
New Zealand,
and other places,

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.012
began to think that it was
important to be able to look at

00:01:37.012 --> 00:01:41.647
a map in their schoolhouse that
had the color red for Britain

00:01:41.647 --> 00:01:46.050
increasingly taking over the map
of Asia and Africa,

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.110
and lots of other places as
well.

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:49.790
So, instead of -- at the very
beginning of that lecture,

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:51.146
I'll say, "Look,
there are three things you

00:01:51.146 --> 00:01:52.590
really ought to know about the
New Imperialism,

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.650
why they did this."
 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.899
Then I talk about the Boy
Scouts, so that those two things

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:00.390
will fit together.
 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.209
Or, when I talk about World War
I, and we'll have two lectures.

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:06.686
My friend and colleague,
Jay Winter, is doing one of

00:02:06.686 --> 00:02:09.550
them on the Great War and modern
memory.

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.038
Instead of trying to do the
entire war, and there is,

00:02:13.038 --> 00:02:16.461
I think, a quite sporty chapter
on that in the book,

00:02:16.461 --> 00:02:18.810
I'll talk about trench warfare.
 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.830
You'll see a film called
Paths of Glory.

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:26.120
That's an early Kubrick film
about the mutinies in 1917.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.956
I'll talk about the mutinies in
1917 when people just said,

00:02:28.956 --> 00:02:30.180
"Enough is enough.
 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.360
There's no sense dying for
nothing.

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.110
We won't go over the top."
 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.906
Which is to say that it's
important to come to lecture,

00:02:37.906 --> 00:02:40.030
and it's important to come to
sections.

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:41.128
I've cut back on the reading.
 

00:02:41.128 --> 00:02:43.788
I used to use about four more
books than I use now,

00:02:43.788 --> 00:02:46.660
but it's better to concentrate
on what you're doing.

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.353
The books are A History of
Modern Europe,

00:02:50.353 --> 00:02:53.811
second edition,
which I wrote for people like

00:02:53.811 --> 00:02:54.440
you.
 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.788
Then you'll read Persian
Letters, not all of it.

00:02:56.788 --> 00:03:00.490
That would be a rather lengthy
day or so.

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:02.370
You'll read excerpts in
Persian Letters,

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:07.908
and Montesquieu talks about
relations between West and East,

00:03:07.908 --> 00:03:12.734
and it's a phenomenal moment in
the history of the

00:03:12.734 --> 00:03:14.310
Enlightenment.
 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.319
Then you have a pause where
you're basically just reading

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:19.658
me,
for better or for worse,

00:03:19.658 --> 00:03:23.018
but I hope for better,
until you get to Ã‰mile

00:03:23.018 --> 00:03:26.479
Zola, his great novel,
Germinal,

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:28.438
which is a classic.
 

00:03:28.438 --> 00:03:34.262
Zola was the first sort of
naturalist novelist,

00:03:34.262 --> 00:03:36.919
at least in France.
 

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:39.843
When he wrote Germinal,
germinal means budding,

00:03:39.843 --> 00:03:41.389
like the budding of trees.
 

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:45.110
But he means the budding of
people being aware of themselves

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.930
as workers.
 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.569
He went down to the mines in
the north of France in the

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:50.110
Anzin.
 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:53.586
One of the heroes of the book
is a woman called Catherine,

00:03:53.586 --> 00:03:56.942
who is fifteen years old,
but has seen a lot of life for

00:03:56.942 --> 00:03:58.650
being fifteen years old.
 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.758
When Zola wrote
Germinal,

00:04:02.758 --> 00:04:06.915
he went down into the mines to
look at fifteen-year-old young

00:04:06.915 --> 00:04:09.150
women,
barely older than girls,

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.158
working in the mines twelve
hours a day.

00:04:12.158 --> 00:04:15.080
It's a book that resounds with
reality.

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:19.432
It's really kind of an amazing
book, and I think you'll like

00:04:19.432 --> 00:04:19.949
that.
 

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:21.269
I hope you will.
 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:25.110
Then Helmut Smith's The
Butcher's Tale is about

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.589
accusations of ritual murder in
a German town.

00:04:28.589 --> 00:04:33.012
It's about the second German
Reich, and it's about

00:04:33.012 --> 00:04:38.250
anti-Semitism in a small place
with bigger consequences.

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:43.675
George Orwell went off to fight
the good fight in Spain during

00:04:43.675 --> 00:04:48.129
the Spanish Civil War,
where it was sort of a dry run

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:53.850
for an even more horrible war,
and even more horrible fascists.

00:04:53.850 --> 00:05:00.000
It's about his engagement and
disillusionment in the Spanish

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.639
republican forces,
the loyalist forces,

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:07.947
and about the tensions and the
duplicity of Stalin's folks

00:05:07.947 --> 00:05:12.709
undercutting the Trotskyites and
undercutting the anarchists.

00:05:12.709 --> 00:05:15.480
It's one of those classics
that's a classic for a very good

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:15.910
reason.
 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:18.439
It's really a marvelous read.
 

00:05:18.439 --> 00:05:20.250
Finally, there's Ordinary
Men.

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:22.350
I go to Poland a lot.
 

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:25.384
In the last couple of years
I've been there four or five

00:05:25.384 --> 00:05:27.976
times for various reasons,
and I'd never been to

00:05:27.976 --> 00:05:28.750
Auschwitz.
 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:32.069
I went to Auschwitz a year ago.
 

00:05:32.069 --> 00:05:33.790
I don't know,
some of you have probably been

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:34.110
there.
 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:37.550
As you're going through the
horror of it all,

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:40.791
and as you're seeing empty
suitcases with people's names on

00:05:40.791 --> 00:05:43.250
them that the people don't exist
anymore,

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:45.889
and you're seeing baby shoes
and things like that.

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:47.990
You think, "Who could have
done this?

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:52.702
Who could have gone out and
simply, in an assembly line way,

00:05:52.702 --> 00:05:54.459
killed people?"
 

00:05:54.459 --> 00:05:57.810
Or in fields around Lodz,
which was a large industrial

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:00.983
town and still is in Poland,
simply gone out and blown the

00:06:00.983 --> 00:06:02.389
brains out of mothers,
babies,

00:06:02.389 --> 00:06:04.319
grandmothers,
and anybody they found.

00:06:04.319 --> 00:06:05.519
Who could have done it?
 

00:06:05.519 --> 00:06:09.509
Well, the answer that Chris
Browning has is ordinary men.

00:06:09.509 --> 00:06:14.726
And he had the quite brilliant
idea of looking at a German

00:06:14.726 --> 00:06:17.286
unit,
essentially policemen from

00:06:17.286 --> 00:06:19.774
Hamburg,
the port town of Hamburg,

00:06:19.774 --> 00:06:22.129
an old important Hanseatic
port.

00:06:22.129 --> 00:06:26.064
And he follows them from the
lives of very ordinary people

00:06:26.064 --> 00:06:29.793
into the killing fields,
it was nothing less than that,

00:06:29.793 --> 00:06:30.759
of Poland.
 

00:06:30.759 --> 00:06:32.120
It's also short.
 

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.519
Germinal is long,
but these other ones are short.

00:06:35.519 --> 00:06:37.331
It's gripping.
 

00:06:37.331 --> 00:06:39.920
It's quite amazing.
 

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:41.720
So, those are the books.
 

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:43.807
I think that A History of
Modern Europe--I hope--is

00:06:43.807 --> 00:06:44.319
fun to read.
 

00:06:44.319 --> 00:06:47.019
I think you will enjoy that.
 

00:06:47.019 --> 00:06:53.190
The lectures kind of--you see
the themes speak for themselves.

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:58.029
Sections, everybody likes
Wednesday night sections.

00:06:58.029 --> 00:07:01.480
One of my colleagues has only
Wednesday night sections.

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:04.259
We've gone increasingly to
that, because sometimes you

00:07:04.259 --> 00:07:07.670
don't find a large audience even
on Friday morning 10:30 slots.

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:08.680
We've abandoned that.
 

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:13.391
So, tentatively,
we're going to have two at 7:00

00:07:13.391 --> 00:07:18.403
p.m., two at 8:00 p.m.,
then Thursday at 1:30 p.m.,

00:07:18.403 --> 00:07:21.310
and Thursday at 2:30 p.m.
 

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:21.867
I don't know.
 

00:07:21.867 --> 00:07:23.199
When are we starting sections?
 

00:07:23.199 --> 00:07:24.879
Sometimes we don't do it until
the second week.

00:07:24.879 --> 00:07:25.620
It depends on what day.
 

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:26.110
What day is this?
 

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:28.459
Wednesday.
 

00:07:28.459 --> 00:07:28.810
I don't know.
 

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:30.449
Maybe we'll start them next
week.

00:07:30.449 --> 00:07:30.899
Maybe we won't.
 

00:07:30.899 --> 00:07:31.610
Who knows?
 

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:35.845
But they will happen,
and there's also a short,

00:07:35.845 --> 00:07:38.240
sporty paper assignment.
 

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:41.769
By short I don't mean two
pages, but something like seven

00:07:41.769 --> 00:07:45.740
pages, eight pages on something
that you want to write about.

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:49.072
Now, let me give you some
examples just off the top of my

00:07:49.072 --> 00:07:49.490
head.
 

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:52.129
If you have any interesting in
painting, for example,

00:07:52.129 --> 00:07:57.579
it would be interesting to take
looks by,

00:07:57.579 --> 00:08:02.829
say, two Impressionist painters
like Pissarro and Renoir,

00:08:02.829 --> 00:08:05.336
and to see how they viewed the
transformation of

00:08:05.336 --> 00:08:08.767
nineteenth-century Paris,
the big boulevards and all of

00:08:08.767 --> 00:08:09.170
that.
 

00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:11.129
Or you could take another novel.
 

00:08:11.129 --> 00:08:13.221
Germinal,
one of the interesting things

00:08:13.221 --> 00:08:15.360
about it is that it's a document
of history.

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:18.081
It's a novel,
so these are invented people,

00:08:18.081 --> 00:08:20.869
but it's a document of history
in some ways,

00:08:20.869 --> 00:08:24.370
as is lots of the great
literature of World War I.

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:28.050
There isn't any period in
modern history that has so much

00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:31.009
gripping literature about it as
the Great War,

00:08:31.009 --> 00:08:34.230
the British war poets like
Siegfried Sassoon.

00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:37.490
And a lot of these people were
dead after they wrote.

00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:39.649
Sassoon wasn't,
at least not immediately.

00:08:39.649 --> 00:08:41.048
I can't remember if he dies in
1918 or not.

00:08:41.048 --> 00:08:45.284
But to take some of the poetry,
or the writing of the war,

00:08:45.284 --> 00:08:47.440
and write a paper about it.
 

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:50.359
Or, if you're into diplomatic
history, or something like

00:08:50.359 --> 00:08:52.693
that--I don't know,
a paper re-evaluating the

00:08:52.693 --> 00:08:54.340
origins of the Crimean War.
 

00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:57.379
That might put you to sleep
before it puts your TA to sleep.

00:08:57.379 --> 00:09:00.139
But you can imagine a good
paper on that.

00:09:00.139 --> 00:09:02.210
You can do whatever you want.
 

00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:05.975
When I do the Enlightenment,
borrowing from my good friend

00:09:05.975 --> 00:09:07.772
Bob Darnton,
I'll do a thing at the

00:09:07.772 --> 00:09:10.600
beginning about why the
Enlightenment was important,

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:11.840
what it is.
 

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:14.075
There's secularization,
rational inquiry,

00:09:14.075 --> 00:09:16.422
and all of that,
stuff that you may already

00:09:16.422 --> 00:09:17.539
know, maybe not.
 

00:09:17.539 --> 00:09:18.960
But it's in the book.
 

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:22.970
But then what I do is I look at
some of the third string,

00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:25.789
or the third division in the
European football sense,

00:09:25.789 --> 00:09:29.740
of Enlightenment hacks,
and what they wrote about

00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:32.090
royalty,
and about aristocrats,

00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:34.989
and the way they kind of
undermined those traditional

00:09:34.989 --> 00:09:37.220
hierarchies that would be swept
away,

00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:40.308
to a large extent,
by the French Revolution.

00:09:40.308 --> 00:09:42.549
Or you could take somebody out
of the French Revolution,

00:09:42.549 --> 00:09:46.336
such as the steely Saint-Just,
who ran off with his mother's

00:09:46.336 --> 00:09:49.326
silver at age sixteen or
something and went on the grand

00:09:49.326 --> 00:09:51.432
tour of France,
and talk about him on the

00:09:51.432 --> 00:09:54.136
Committee of Public Safety that
signed away the lives of lots of

00:09:54.136 --> 00:09:55.932
people,
but may have also saved the

00:09:55.932 --> 00:09:56.519
revolution.
 

00:09:56.519 --> 00:09:58.600
You can do whatever you want.
 

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:01.964
Well, it should have something
to do with the course and in the

00:10:01.964 --> 00:10:03.808
time period we're talking about.
 

00:10:03.808 --> 00:10:08.080
Nothing on the Red Sox or
something, but you would work

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:10.690
with your teaching participant.
 

00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:12.210
I'm an email animal.
 

00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:14.658
I'm always available on email,
and I have office hours as

00:10:14.658 --> 00:10:16.538
well, but people don't come much
anymore.

00:10:16.538 --> 00:10:19.739
They're doing NBA.com,
because email has made office

00:10:19.739 --> 00:10:21.370
hours sort of oblivious.
 

00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:23.139
I mean, irrelevant,
not oblivious.

00:10:23.139 --> 00:10:26.110
But people are oblivious to my
office hours.

00:10:26.110 --> 00:10:29.721
But, anyway,
they are Mondays,

00:10:29.721 --> 00:10:32.090
1:00 to 2:30 p.m.
 

00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:35.196
It used to be 3:00 p.m.,
but I just sit there by myself,

00:10:35.196 --> 00:10:36.269
1:00 to 2:30 p.m.
 

00:10:36.269 --> 00:10:41.308
in Branford College, K13.
 

00:10:41.308 --> 00:10:45.082
There are also two other movies
when we get to fascism,

00:10:45.082 --> 00:10:47.178
when we get to Adolf Hitler.
 

00:10:47.178 --> 00:10:51.600
He was only one of a whole
bunch of dictators.

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:55.184
There were hardly any
parliamentary regimes left in

00:10:55.184 --> 00:10:58.340
continental Europe by the time
1939 comes.

00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:01.736
A woman called Leni
Riefenstahl, who just died in

00:11:01.736 --> 00:11:04.994
2002 at age 102,
when she was a young woman did

00:11:04.994 --> 00:11:07.330
a propaganda film for Hitler.
 

00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:09.580
Hitler, like Mussolini,
believed in high tech.

00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:12.100
He was one of the first people
to use the radio.

00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:14.308
Franklin Roosevelt used the
fireside chat of the radio.

00:11:14.308 --> 00:11:18.642
But Mussolini was already there
piling falsehood upon falsehood,

00:11:18.642 --> 00:11:22.493
and Italians who could barely
afford to eat all had their

00:11:22.493 --> 00:11:23.250
radios.
 

00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:25.908
The same thing happened in
Germany as well.

00:11:25.908 --> 00:11:29.462
She did a movie,
a documentary called Triumph

00:11:29.462 --> 00:11:32.110
of the Will,
about Nuremburg.

00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:33.080
It is truly chilling.
 

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:36.592
It's amazing,
it looks like a political

00:11:36.592 --> 00:11:40.200
convention or something in some
ways.

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:43.886
All of these movies you can see
in the privacy of your luxurious

00:11:43.886 --> 00:11:46.990
suites in Branford or Pierson
College or wherever,

00:11:46.990 --> 00:11:50.000
because they're available now
in ways I don't even understand,

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.529
but on your Internet.
 

00:11:51.529 --> 00:11:54.000
We used to actually show them
here.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.727
I used to use a great movie
called The Sorrow and the

00:11:56.727 --> 00:11:59.159
Pity, Le Chagrin et la
pitiÃ©.

00:11:59.159 --> 00:12:01.629
It was four hours long.
 

00:12:01.629 --> 00:12:04.490
People described it as a two
six-pack movie.

00:12:04.490 --> 00:12:06.822
The janitors complained because
there were so many beer bottles

00:12:06.822 --> 00:12:07.500
rattling around.
 

00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:10.639
But, of course,
this was before the drinking

00:12:10.639 --> 00:12:11.879
age was raised.
 

00:12:11.879 --> 00:12:14.450
So, of course,
I don't show that movie.

00:12:14.450 --> 00:12:14.942
I take that back.
 

00:12:14.942 --> 00:12:16.190
I don't take that back,
but what the hell.

00:12:16.190 --> 00:12:19.610
Anyway, I don't show that movie
anymore.

00:12:19.610 --> 00:12:23.364
But I do show Triumph of the
Will, and you can watch that

00:12:23.364 --> 00:12:23.960
at home.
 

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:26.278
The other one is Au revoir
les enfants.

00:12:26.278 --> 00:12:30.206
Because one of the last
lectures I talk about resistance

00:12:30.206 --> 00:12:33.331
and collaboration in Europe,
and because I live in France

00:12:33.331 --> 00:12:37.548
much of the time,
I talk about France.

00:12:37.548 --> 00:12:39.965
Au revoir les enfants,
Goodbye Children,

00:12:39.965 --> 00:12:41.470
some of you have probably seen.
 

00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:44.868
It was made by Louis Malle,
who just died a couple of years

00:12:44.868 --> 00:12:45.220
ago.
 

00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:47.556
It was about when he was in
college,

00:12:47.556 --> 00:12:50.558
so he was the equivalent of
7^(th) and 8^(th) grade.

00:12:50.558 --> 00:12:53.836
There was a new boy that shows
up at school during World War II

00:12:53.836 --> 00:12:56.110
in Fontainebleau,
which is just southeast of

00:12:56.110 --> 00:12:56.639
Paris.
 

00:12:56.639 --> 00:12:59.379
He's a boy who hadn't been
there before.

00:12:59.379 --> 00:13:01.110
He's a Jewish boy.
 

00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:05.288
It's about his friendship with
this boy, and what happens.

00:13:05.288 --> 00:13:09.354
At the end, it's not a happy
film, but it's a great,

00:13:09.354 --> 00:13:10.389
great film.
 

00:13:10.389 --> 00:13:11.419
What else?
 

00:13:11.419 --> 00:13:11.629
What to say?
 

00:13:11.629 --> 00:13:12.639
There's a midterm.
 

00:13:12.639 --> 00:13:15.308
I don't like to waste a lecture
giving a midterm.

00:13:15.308 --> 00:13:19.741
I would rather give a lecture,
but we have to have something

00:13:19.741 --> 00:13:21.168
to report to you.
 

00:13:21.168 --> 00:13:24.047
If you tube it,
if you don't do very well at

00:13:24.047 --> 00:13:27.460
all, we don't count it as much
as if you do well.

00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:29.120
People ask these questions,
I know.

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:30.509
How much is it worth?
 

00:13:30.509 --> 00:13:33.511
Geez, there's more to live than
grades, but it's something like

00:13:33.511 --> 00:13:36.370
twenty-five percent and the
paper is twenty-five percent.

00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:40.722
Section participation is ten
percent, whatever we work out,

00:13:40.722 --> 00:13:42.000
then the final.
 

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:48.500
It's an exercise in seeing how
you're doing.

00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:53.686
It really is no big deal,
but it will help you pull the

00:13:53.686 --> 00:13:56.759
themes of the course together.
 

00:13:56.759 --> 00:13:58.840
It's no scary situation.
 

00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:03.418
We all live in this sort of A-,
B range.

00:14:03.418 --> 00:14:05.616
I'll tell you,
a couple of years ago I ran

00:14:05.616 --> 00:14:06.690
into this student.
 

00:14:06.690 --> 00:14:09.313
When I run into students,
I'm a friendly guy and I see

00:14:09.313 --> 00:14:11.740
people, and I say,
"Hi, how are you?"

00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:12.600
I ran into this one person.
 

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:13.690
I said, "Hi,
how are you?"

00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:17.429
And she went,
"Oh, hello."

00:14:17.429 --> 00:14:18.408
Oh?
 

00:14:18.408 --> 00:14:20.615
I remembered her name and I
went and looked it up,

00:14:20.615 --> 00:14:21.649
and there was the B .
 

00:14:21.649 --> 00:14:24.019
It wasn't that,
"Hi, how are you?

00:14:24.019 --> 00:14:26.908
A- or A," but whatever.
 

00:14:26.908 --> 00:14:29.418
I'm sure she had all A's in the
other courses,

00:14:29.418 --> 00:14:32.761
and a B is not the end of the
world, and most people get A's,

00:14:32.761 --> 00:14:33.710
but whatever.
 

00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:34.610
You have to take the midterm.
 

00:14:34.610 --> 00:14:35.980
That's the way they run it here.
 

00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:38.822
That's not my idea,
so that's what we're going to

00:14:38.822 --> 00:14:39.120
do.
 

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:42.808
Okay, now I'm going to talk
about some of the themes.

00:14:42.808 --> 00:14:45.759
At the end, I'm going to read
you a poem.

00:14:45.759 --> 00:14:50.830
I started history in a serious
way because I read this poem.

00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:53.740
So, I'll leave that until the
end of it.

00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:55.500
I didn't got to Yale.
 

00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:59.835
I went to the University of
Michigan, maize and blue

00:14:59.835 --> 00:15:03.149
forever, very sad since last
weekend.

00:15:03.149 --> 00:15:05.879
I came from Portland, Oregon.
 

00:15:05.879 --> 00:15:07.101
I don't know if any of you come
from Portland,

00:15:07.101 --> 00:15:08.080
Oregon, but that's where I'm
from.

00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:11.764
When I went off to Michigan,
I'd been at a Jesuit high

00:15:11.764 --> 00:15:12.389
school.
 

00:15:12.389 --> 00:15:15.073
Jesuit high school was a sports
factory, in part,

00:15:15.073 --> 00:15:18.428
but it was a very good school,
but it was very repressive.

00:15:18.428 --> 00:15:22.682
I went off to the University of
Michigan after having been in

00:15:22.682 --> 00:15:24.879
Jesuit school for four years.
 

00:15:24.879 --> 00:15:26.470
It was wine, women, and song.
 

00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:31.408
There weren't enough in the
middle and probably too much of

00:15:31.408 --> 00:15:32.428
the first.
 

00:15:32.428 --> 00:15:37.110
My first semester I got a 1.93
grade point average,

00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:42.539
and my mother asked me if that
was on a two-point scale.

00:15:42.539 --> 00:15:43.929
I'm serious.
 

00:15:43.929 --> 00:15:45.799
I had an F.
 

00:15:45.799 --> 00:15:47.408
I shouldn't laugh at myself.
 

00:15:47.408 --> 00:15:48.442
My kids say,
"Oh, my god,

00:15:48.442 --> 00:15:49.620
not the same story again."
 

00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:52.542
But I got an F,
and I got two C's,

00:15:52.542 --> 00:15:53.960
and I got a B.
 

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:57.508
The people I hung around with
in Ann Arbor were so

00:15:57.508 --> 00:16:00.043
unaccomplished,
some of them anyway,

00:16:00.043 --> 00:16:03.808
that they thought I was smart
because I got a B.

00:16:03.808 --> 00:16:05.643
I'd go by in the dining room
and they'd say,

00:16:05.643 --> 00:16:06.710
"He got a B."
 

00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:08.559
They asked me to tutor them.
 

00:16:08.559 --> 00:16:10.028
Can you imagine that?
 

00:16:10.028 --> 00:16:12.168
Some of the people that I hung
around with were amazing.

00:16:12.168 --> 00:16:14.580
You may even know people like
that, but I don't think so.

00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:17.602
But one of the guys that I
knew, I've got to get back to

00:16:17.602 --> 00:16:20.296
the topic in a minute,
but I just thought of this,

00:16:20.296 --> 00:16:22.549
was sort of the king of
malapropisms.

00:16:22.549 --> 00:16:24.028
One day he was going on and on.
 

00:16:24.028 --> 00:16:25.330
These are the people I hung
around with.

00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:28.373
He was going on and on about
this good meal that he had of

00:16:28.373 --> 00:16:30.990
one course after another,
and it was fantastic.

00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:34.990
It was a really good
restaurant, and somebody snuck

00:16:34.990 --> 00:16:36.269
him some wine.
 

00:16:36.269 --> 00:16:38.504
Finally, I'm tired of the whole
thing and I said,

00:16:38.504 --> 00:16:39.808
"Was it gratis?"
 

00:16:39.808 --> 00:16:41.820
He said, "No,
it was chicken."

00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:43.985
Those are the people that I
hung around with at the

00:16:43.985 --> 00:16:45.070
University of Michigan.
 

00:16:45.070 --> 00:16:47.875
But I've taught here a long
time and I stand by maize and

00:16:47.875 --> 00:16:49.080
blue, but I love Yale.
 

00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:50.842
One of the things I love about
Yale is being able to teach

00:16:50.842 --> 00:16:51.399
people like you.
 

00:16:51.399 --> 00:16:53.759
And I mean it,
and I love this course,

00:16:53.759 --> 00:16:57.460
so I hope that you will enjoy
it, if indeed you take it.

00:16:57.460 --> 00:16:59.450
What about some of the themes?
 

00:16:59.450 --> 00:17:01.308
What kind of stuff are we going
to do?

00:17:01.308 --> 00:17:05.980
Could you get some syllabi for
some of those folks back there?

00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:08.279
They're up on the thing.
 

00:17:08.279 --> 00:17:09.619
Thanks a lot.
 

00:17:09.619 --> 00:17:11.490
A couple of themes.
 

00:17:11.490 --> 00:17:13.468
I don't believe,
and I've never believed,

00:17:13.468 --> 00:17:15.200
that history is a series of
bins.

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:17.296
I guess I wrote that in the
book, but that you open up and

00:17:17.296 --> 00:17:19.210
you say, "Well,
there goes the Enlightenment.

00:17:19.210 --> 00:17:20.450
Shut that baby down."
 

00:17:20.450 --> 00:17:22.534
Then you open up the next one,
and here comes

00:17:22.534 --> 00:17:25.140
eighteenth-century rivalries,
and you shut that baby.

00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:28.131
Then the French Revolution,
"Oh, I know all about that

00:17:28.131 --> 00:17:28.750
now."
 

00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:31.457
Pretty soon you go on to
Russian Revolution eventually,

00:17:31.457 --> 00:17:32.210
and all that.
 

00:17:32.210 --> 00:17:35.615
To do a course like this where
you're going to learn much of

00:17:35.615 --> 00:17:38.848
what is important to know about
western civilization,

00:17:38.848 --> 00:17:40.976
I do believe,
if you do the reading and

00:17:40.976 --> 00:17:43.608
stuff,
and if you enjoy the lectures,

00:17:43.608 --> 00:17:47.536
there have to be some threads
that go all the way through that

00:17:47.536 --> 00:17:50.240
make it worth it so you learn
something.

00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:52.920
One is certainly state-making.
 

00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:54.798
Even if you take a sort of
federalized,

00:17:54.798 --> 00:17:58.556
decentralized state like with
this very bizarre electoral

00:17:58.556 --> 00:18:02.865
system like the United States,
that the growth of modern

00:18:02.865 --> 00:18:05.042
states,
it doesn't really just come in

00:18:05.042 --> 00:18:07.700
the twentieth century with the
welfare state beginning in

00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:09.526
England,
and even before that in some

00:18:09.526 --> 00:18:11.685
other places,
insurance programs and things

00:18:11.685 --> 00:18:12.250
like that.
 

00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:15.358
It begins with the
consolidation of state power in

00:18:15.358 --> 00:18:18.660
the late Middle Ages with
territorial monarchies,

00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:23.410
the Spanish, and the French,
and the English monarchies.

00:18:23.410 --> 00:18:26.269
It has a lot to do with the
growth of absolute rule.

00:18:26.269 --> 00:18:29.511
That's what I'm going to talk
about next time,

00:18:29.511 --> 00:18:31.528
absolute rule,
absolutism.

00:18:31.528 --> 00:18:35.589
The growth of standing armies,
huge standing armies,

00:18:35.589 --> 00:18:38.694
never seen before,
of big forts built on

00:18:38.694 --> 00:18:39.808
frontiers.
 

00:18:39.808 --> 00:18:43.118
It has a lot to do with
bureaucrats who could extract

00:18:43.118 --> 00:18:45.220
resources from ordinary people.
 

00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:48.237
A lot of the rich didn't pay
anything or hardly anything at

00:18:48.237 --> 00:18:48.548
all.
 

00:18:48.548 --> 00:18:51.055
It has to do with an
allegiance, a dynastic

00:18:51.055 --> 00:18:54.277
allegiance that could be
transferred later to a nation,

00:18:54.277 --> 00:18:55.650
the idea of nation.
 

00:18:55.650 --> 00:18:57.509
That starts in the eighteenth
century.

00:18:57.509 --> 00:18:59.130
It doesn't start in the
nineteenth century.

00:18:59.130 --> 00:19:03.038
It starts in the eighteenth
century, at least in Britain.

00:19:03.038 --> 00:19:06.960
That's an argument that we'll
make also.

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:11.559
In 1500, which is kind of when
that book gets rolling--they

00:19:11.559 --> 00:19:16.000
only start in about 1648--there
were about 1500 different

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.538
territorial units in Europe.
 

00:19:18.538 --> 00:19:22.368
Some were no bigger than
Archbishop's Garden in Germany,

00:19:22.368 --> 00:19:24.913
and some were larger
states--not yet what they are

00:19:24.913 --> 00:19:29.230
now in terms of size,
such as France,

00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:35.220
which expanded under Louis XIV
into Alsace and Lorraine,

00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:37.730
and various other places.
 

00:19:37.730 --> 00:19:40.670
But there's about 1500
territorial units.

00:19:40.670 --> 00:19:43.750
In 1890, there were thirty.
 

00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:46.390
So, the consolidation of state
power,

00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:49.220
which is looking at it from the
state out,

00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:54.761
or the emergence of an identity
where you see yourself as German

00:19:54.761 --> 00:19:59.884
as opposed to Bavarian,
French as opposed to Gascon or

00:19:59.884 --> 00:20:04.010
Provencal,
Spanish as opposed to Castilian

00:20:04.010 --> 00:20:06.519
or as opposed to Catalan.
 

00:20:06.519 --> 00:20:11.711
The Catalan language was
illegal until 1975,

00:20:11.711 --> 00:20:17.267
until Francisco Franco finally
croaked in 1975,

00:20:17.267 --> 00:20:19.200
in November.
 

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:22.019
This is a great phrase;
I wish I'd said it originally.

00:20:22.019 --> 00:20:25.480
I don't know who said it,
but someone once said that a

00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:28.420
language is a dialect with a
powerful army.

00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:28.779
That's it.
 

00:20:28.779 --> 00:20:29.808
That's true.
 

00:20:29.808 --> 00:20:32.368
France at the time of the
French Revolution,

00:20:32.368 --> 00:20:34.750
half the people in France knew
French.

00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:35.859
There was bilingualism.
 

00:20:35.859 --> 00:20:37.150
You could know Catalan.
 

00:20:37.150 --> 00:20:39.670
You could know Auvergnat patois.
 

00:20:39.670 --> 00:20:43.240
We live in the south of France
where a lot of old people still

00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:46.108
speak a patois,
though that's mostly dying out.

00:20:46.108 --> 00:20:50.940
How does it come that identity,
a sense of allegiance to a

00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:52.720
state or a country?
 

00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:55.598
Not everybody,
but how does it come to 1914

00:20:55.598 --> 00:20:58.682
when people go marching off to
get killed singing the

00:20:58.682 --> 00:21:02.059
Marseillaise,
the French national anthem,

00:21:02.059 --> 00:21:03.650
in pretty good French?
 

00:21:03.650 --> 00:21:05.118
How does that happen?
 

00:21:05.118 --> 00:21:08.180
How does a state increase its
reach?

00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:10.818
How is the modern world created?
 

00:21:10.818 --> 00:21:13.748
We call this process,
it's a clumsy word,

00:21:13.748 --> 00:21:15.140
but state-making.
 

00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:16.170
How do states form?
 

00:21:16.170 --> 00:21:18.950
The other side of this is how
do identities change?

00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:20.737
In the sixteenth century,
seventeenth century,

00:21:20.737 --> 00:21:21.730
ask somebody they were.
 

00:21:21.730 --> 00:21:23.690
Say, "Who are you?"
 

00:21:23.690 --> 00:21:25.210
They'd say, "I'm so and so.
 

00:21:25.210 --> 00:21:26.390
I'm of this family."
 

00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:28.164
Or, "I am
Protestant,"

00:21:28.164 --> 00:21:31.660
if it was the sixteenth century
or late sixteenth century,

00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:34.829
any time after 1520s or 1530s
in parts of Germany.

00:21:34.829 --> 00:21:35.269
"I'm Protestant.
 

00:21:35.269 --> 00:21:37.788
I'm Jewish."
 

00:21:37.788 --> 00:21:40.970
In much of the Balkans,
"I am Muslim."

00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:43.858
In most of Europe,
"I am Catholic."

00:21:43.858 --> 00:21:46.558
In Eastern Europe,
"I am Russian Orthodox.

00:21:46.558 --> 00:21:50.710
I live in a mir (village) in
Russia."

00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:53.173
How does that happen by the end
of the nineteenth century that

00:21:53.173 --> 00:21:55.365
people have,
even Russia as they're starving

00:21:55.365 --> 00:21:57.731
to death,
starving in the famine that

00:21:57.731 --> 00:21:59.314
Tolstoy,
the great writer,

00:21:59.314 --> 00:22:01.088
called the world's attention
to.

00:22:01.088 --> 00:22:03.740
A lot of them died in fields
thinking,

00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:06.618
"only if the czar only
knew that we were starving,

00:22:06.618 --> 00:22:09.009
and that his ministers were
treating us bad,

00:22:09.009 --> 00:22:10.369
how angry he would be."
 

00:22:10.369 --> 00:22:11.210
Well, they didn't get it.
 

00:22:11.210 --> 00:22:14.108
They didn't know that the czar
could have given one damn.

00:22:14.108 --> 00:22:18.633
But the allegiance to the czar,
the sense of being Russian or

00:22:18.633 --> 00:22:23.156
being dominated by the Russian
czar, is something that had to

00:22:23.156 --> 00:22:24.588
be constructed.
 

00:22:24.588 --> 00:22:29.239
So, the state constructs its
ability to extract taxes,

00:22:29.239 --> 00:22:33.624
extract bodies for national
armies, also to provide

00:22:33.624 --> 00:22:37.660
resources, but identities are
transformed.

00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:42.096
So, I give this as an example,
because state-making is one of

00:22:42.096 --> 00:22:45.868
the themes that kind of ties
everything together.

00:22:45.868 --> 00:22:49.606
This course ends in 1945,
but look at the problems in the

00:22:49.606 --> 00:22:52.210
post-communist world of
state-making.

00:22:52.210 --> 00:22:55.505
Look what's going on in
Georgia, which is more

00:22:55.505 --> 00:22:59.900
complicated than the newspapers
present in very many ways.

00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:03.930
Look at the horror show of the
Balkans in the 1990s.

00:23:03.930 --> 00:23:06.587
A lot of the issues,
religious hatreds that we

00:23:06.587 --> 00:23:09.660
thought only would be limited to
Northern Ireland.

00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:12.071
That's another theme that's
very important to the whole

00:23:12.071 --> 00:23:12.430
thing.
 

00:23:12.430 --> 00:23:15.318
Another, of course,
is economic change.

00:23:15.318 --> 00:23:17.529
Obviously, this is not a course
in economic history,

00:23:17.529 --> 00:23:20.660
but the rise of capitalism,
that's what it's called,

00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:23.450
capitalism or large-scale
industrialization.

00:23:23.450 --> 00:23:26.181
It changes in ways that we'll
suggest in the reading,

00:23:26.181 --> 00:23:29.175
and then I'll talk about a
little bit, the way people live

00:23:29.175 --> 00:23:30.700
in very fundamental ways.
 

00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:33.667
There's lot of continuities,
but there's lots of big

00:23:33.667 --> 00:23:34.250
changes.
 

00:23:34.250 --> 00:23:37.068
Everybody doesn't end up in the
assembly lines right away.

00:23:37.068 --> 00:23:41.150
There are other ways of rural
production.

00:23:41.150 --> 00:23:44.700
Women's work remains terribly,
terribly important.

00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:47.200
I'll spend some time doing that.
 

00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:50.420
A very dear friend of mine,
my mentor indeed, Chuck Tilley,

00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:52.279
who just died a couple months
ago,

00:23:52.279 --> 00:23:56.311
to my great sadness,
once said that "it's

00:23:56.311 --> 00:24:02.538
bitter hard to write the history
of remainders."

00:24:02.538 --> 00:24:05.180
Lots of people were left out of
all of this.

00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:08.640
I'll do one lecture when I talk
about popular protest.

00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:13.298
I'll take three examples of
people rebelling.

00:24:13.298 --> 00:24:16.329
I stand back and say,
"What does this mean?

00:24:16.329 --> 00:24:18.048
What is going on here?"
 

00:24:18.048 --> 00:24:20.490
I take the example from the
Pyrenees Mountains,

00:24:20.490 --> 00:24:22.348
a place called the
AriÃ¨ge.

00:24:22.348 --> 00:24:25.180
You're not responsible for that
name, would never be.

00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:29.150
But where suddenly men dressed
as women carrying guns,

00:24:29.150 --> 00:24:31.730
or carrying pitchforks,
came down out of the mists,

00:24:31.730 --> 00:24:36.459
out of the snow and drove away
charcoal burners and drove away

00:24:36.459 --> 00:24:37.700
forest guards.
 

00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:37.950
Why?
 

00:24:37.950 --> 00:24:41.720
Because they'd lost access to
glean, to pasture their

00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:43.170
miserable animals.
 

00:24:43.170 --> 00:24:45.487
Because the wealthy,
big surprise,

00:24:45.487 --> 00:24:49.490
got the law on their side as
the price of wood goes up.

00:24:49.490 --> 00:24:51.130
They didn't walk around saying,
"Well, I'm a remainder.

00:24:51.130 --> 00:24:53.363
Eventually, I'm going to have
to move to Toulouse and my

00:24:53.363 --> 00:24:55.759
great-great-grandchildren will
work in the Aero Spatial,

00:24:55.759 --> 00:24:58.108
in the air industry there."
 

00:24:58.108 --> 00:24:59.905
They didn't say,
"I'm remainder number

00:24:59.905 --> 00:25:00.420
231."
 

00:25:00.420 --> 00:25:02.150
But they fought for their
dignity,

00:25:02.150 --> 00:25:05.920
and for a sense of justice they
thought existed at one time that

00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:09.391
had been taken away by these
economic changes they couldn't

00:25:09.391 --> 00:25:10.108
control.
 

00:25:10.108 --> 00:25:12.480
Then I take an example from the
south of England,

00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:18.182
from the same time, 1829,1830,
when they find people dead with

00:25:18.182 --> 00:25:20.130
only dandelions in their
stomach,

00:25:20.130 --> 00:25:21.420
dead of hunger.
 

00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:24.390
Then these people start
marching the poor,

00:25:24.390 --> 00:25:25.838
the wretched poor.
 

00:25:25.838 --> 00:25:28.596
Rural laborers start marching
and threatening people with

00:25:28.596 --> 00:25:29.630
threshing machines.
 

00:25:29.630 --> 00:25:30.538
Why threshing machines?
 

00:25:30.538 --> 00:25:34.460
Because threshing machines were
taking away their work as

00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:35.368
harvesters.
 

00:25:35.368 --> 00:25:37.108
And one day they found a sign
that said,

00:25:37.108 --> 00:25:41.372
"Revenge from thee is on
the wing from thy determined

00:25:41.372 --> 00:25:45.410
Captain Swing,"
suggesting that they were many.

00:25:45.410 --> 00:25:46.960
They were righteous.
 

00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:48.529
They were just.
 

00:25:48.529 --> 00:25:49.700
They were armed.
 

00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:50.480
They were ready.
 

00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:52.140
Did Captain Swing exist?
 

00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:53.450
Of course not.
 

00:25:53.450 --> 00:25:55.420
They were weak and they get
lost.

00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:57.140
They get defeated.
 

00:25:57.140 --> 00:25:57.920
Some of them are hung.
 

00:25:57.920 --> 00:26:01.248
Lots of them are sent to
Tasmania to the prison at Port

00:26:01.248 --> 00:26:02.420
Arthur, Tasmania.
 

00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:03.910
They're sent to Australia.
 

00:26:03.910 --> 00:26:06.240
That's why when the Australians
play the English,

00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:09.220
a lot of the Australians sing
that old Beatles' song,

00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:10.435
"Yellow
Submarine",

00:26:10.435 --> 00:26:12.950
which you don't remember,
which I vaguely remember.

00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:16.614
"We all live in a convict
colony, a convict colony,

00:26:16.614 --> 00:26:17.880
a convict colony.
 

00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:20.243
Captain Swing,
they lost, but they went down

00:26:20.243 --> 00:26:20.848
fighting.
 

00:26:20.848 --> 00:26:23.430
It's bitter hard to write the
history of remainders.

00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:25.946
But when you look up from that
and you say, "Look what's

00:26:25.946 --> 00:26:26.868
going on here."
 

00:26:26.868 --> 00:26:29.556
When you look at people
fighting for grain,

00:26:29.556 --> 00:26:32.307
fighting for food,
they're fighting a larger

00:26:32.307 --> 00:26:34.608
process that they can't control.
 

00:26:34.608 --> 00:26:37.226
But it tells you a lot of
what's going on over the big

00:26:37.226 --> 00:26:37.720
picture.
 

00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:39.558
That's another one.
 

00:26:39.558 --> 00:26:41.816
Then there is,
I'll just take one more,

00:26:41.816 --> 00:26:43.480
maybe another ten minutes.
 

00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:45.240
I'm going to read you my poem.
 

00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:46.730
Then you can go.
 

00:26:46.730 --> 00:26:49.119
But I hope you come back.
 

00:26:49.119 --> 00:26:55.440
War--war as a dynamic of change.
 

00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:57.930
Warfare changes with Napoleon.
 

00:26:57.930 --> 00:26:59.680
There were already changes in
the eighteenth century,

00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:02.185
but it's still basically
professional armies or people

00:27:02.185 --> 00:27:04.220
getting conscripted in the
British navy,

00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:06.480
because they were drunk at the
wrong place at the wrong time

00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:08.358
outside of a tavern in
Portsmouth or something.

00:27:08.358 --> 00:27:12.432
The next thing they know,
they're throwing up on a ship

00:27:12.432 --> 00:27:15.450
bobbing off toward the English
empire.

00:27:15.450 --> 00:27:18.798
But warfare changes with the
nation's state.

00:27:18.798 --> 00:27:20.539
The French called it
leveÃ©

00:27:20.539 --> 00:27:22.430
en masse,
that's mass conscription,

00:27:22.430 --> 00:27:24.318
the sense of defending the
nation.

00:27:24.318 --> 00:27:28.605
There's this magic moment where
the artisans of Paris defeat the

00:27:28.605 --> 00:27:32.757
highly-professionalized army at
a windmill called Valmy in the

00:27:32.757 --> 00:27:34.049
east of France.
 

00:27:34.049 --> 00:27:36.000
It changes the way things were.
 

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.890
Napoleon is arguably the first
total war,

00:27:38.890 --> 00:27:42.547
because of a war against
civilians where there are no

00:27:42.547 --> 00:27:46.275
longer the traditional limits
between fighting against

00:27:46.275 --> 00:27:49.230
civilians and fighting against
armies.

00:27:49.230 --> 00:27:51.640
Those limits hadn't existed in
the Thirty Years' War.

00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:55.039
I'll talk a little bit about
that next time around.

00:27:55.039 --> 00:27:56.608
But the wars are very different.
 

00:27:56.608 --> 00:28:00.782
There's famous Goya paintings
of peasants being gunned down by

00:28:00.782 --> 00:28:03.999
French soldiers,
and atrocities against peasants

00:28:03.999 --> 00:28:06.598
in Calabria in the south of
Italy.

00:28:06.598 --> 00:28:09.265
So, warfare really changes,
but it becomes a dynamic of

00:28:09.265 --> 00:28:09.710
change.
 

00:28:09.710 --> 00:28:13.108
If you think about the Russian
Revolution of 1917,

00:28:13.108 --> 00:28:16.519
the Russian Revolution was not
inconceivable without World War

00:28:16.519 --> 00:28:18.237
I,
but it was sort of

00:28:18.237 --> 00:28:22.630
inconceivable without the
Russian Revolution of 1905,

00:28:22.630 --> 00:28:27.320
and the defeat by the Japanese
in an extraordinary shocking

00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:30.585
event,
at least for Europeans in 1904

00:28:30.585 --> 00:28:31.430
and 1905.
 

00:28:31.430 --> 00:28:35.393
And World War I provides
opportunities for dissidents in

00:28:35.393 --> 00:28:38.058
Russia to put forward their
claims.

00:28:38.058 --> 00:28:41.840
So, when the whole thing
collapses on the czar's head in

00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:44.561
February 1917,
and the Bolsheviks come to

00:28:44.561 --> 00:28:47.381
power,
the war itself was a dynamic of

00:28:47.381 --> 00:28:48.589
change as well.
 

00:28:48.589 --> 00:28:50.289
And what a war.
 

00:28:50.289 --> 00:28:51.298
What wars.
 

00:28:51.298 --> 00:28:53.460
There have been nothing ever
like it.

00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:57.867
A few journalists who had been
in the Russo-Japanese war had

00:28:57.867 --> 00:29:01.528
seen trenches in Manchuria that
had been built.

00:29:01.528 --> 00:29:05.066
But nobody could have imagined
that the war that was supposed

00:29:05.066 --> 00:29:07.894
to be over in six weeks was
going to destroy four

00:29:07.894 --> 00:29:11.829
empires--the Ottoman empire,
the Austro-Hungarian empire,

00:29:11.829 --> 00:29:15.807
the German empire,
and the Russian empire,

00:29:15.807 --> 00:29:18.305
and, arguably,
we can talk about this and we

00:29:18.305 --> 00:29:20.230
can debate this,
the British empire.

00:29:20.230 --> 00:29:24.358
Because lots of people who had
fought in India,

00:29:24.358 --> 00:29:26.140
Indians who had fought in the
war,

00:29:26.140 --> 00:29:28.606
or people now we would call
Pakistanis who'd fought in the

00:29:28.606 --> 00:29:30.376
war,
or people from Kenya who'd

00:29:30.376 --> 00:29:33.593
fought in the war are no longer
going to be satisfied with

00:29:33.593 --> 00:29:36.808
simply arguing that they're part
of the great empire,

00:29:36.808 --> 00:29:39.740
even though they have hardly
any rights and no money,

00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:43.259
and simply work for the big guy.
 

00:29:43.259 --> 00:29:49.470
So, the war transforms Europe
by destroying these empires.

00:29:49.470 --> 00:29:52.087
What it also does,
and it's very possible to argue

00:29:52.087 --> 00:29:55.308
this,
and my friend, Jay Winter,

00:29:55.308 --> 00:29:56.920
who is a great expert on World
War I,

00:29:56.920 --> 00:29:59.170
and Bruno Cabanes also,
who's on leave this year,

00:29:59.170 --> 00:30:00.328
would agree with this.
 

00:30:00.328 --> 00:30:04.698
You could see the whole period
in 1914-1945 as a new and more

00:30:04.698 --> 00:30:06.808
terrible Thirty Years' War.
 

00:30:06.808 --> 00:30:10.107
Because Europe is in depression
all through the 1920s and

00:30:10.107 --> 00:30:13.230
Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ30s, agricultural
depression the whole time.

00:30:13.230 --> 00:30:17.108
Only between 1924 and 1929 is
it not a big industrial

00:30:17.108 --> 00:30:18.078
depression.
 

00:30:18.078 --> 00:30:21.310
The poisoning of the political
atmosphere--I'm going to do a

00:30:21.310 --> 00:30:24.269
whole lecture on Hitler and the
national socialists.

00:30:24.269 --> 00:30:26.140
World War I created Hitler.
 

00:30:26.140 --> 00:30:29.582
He was already just this
pathetic guy with grandiose

00:30:29.582 --> 00:30:33.290
plans, no friends,
and sort of a sad sack going to

00:30:33.290 --> 00:30:37.430
the theatre and droning on and
on about all he knew about

00:30:37.430 --> 00:30:39.000
Wager,
whom he loved,

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.338
and the theatre,
and in a threadbare coat.

00:30:41.338 --> 00:30:44.160
But World War I transforms him
into an anti-Semite.

00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:45.940
He was already an
anti-socialist.

00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:48.170
It transforms him into an
anti-Semite.

00:30:48.170 --> 00:30:51.681
The troops that came back,
many of them simply kept on

00:30:51.681 --> 00:30:52.410
marching.
 

00:30:52.410 --> 00:30:56.088
They'd survived the war and
they kept on marching.

00:30:56.088 --> 00:30:58.971
The poisoning in the political
atmosphere was something that

00:30:58.971 --> 00:31:00.288
was simply extraordinary.
 

00:31:00.288 --> 00:31:02.737
To understand fascism,
this is terribly,

00:31:02.737 --> 00:31:05.625
terribly important,
you have to understand what

00:31:05.625 --> 00:31:07.318
happens in World War I.
 

00:31:07.318 --> 00:31:11.160
Great expectations dashed the
Treaty of Versailles,

00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:12.819
which only the great British
thinker,

00:31:12.819 --> 00:31:14.890
John Maynard Keynes,
really got right,

00:31:14.890 --> 00:31:16.890
predicting the disaster that
came out of it.

00:31:16.890 --> 00:31:19.846
There's no more fascinating
period in history,

00:31:19.846 --> 00:31:20.700
in my mind.
 

00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:23.069
It's absolutely fantastic.
 

00:31:23.069 --> 00:31:24.549
What a war.
 

00:31:24.549 --> 00:31:25.230
It's all obvious.
 

00:31:25.230 --> 00:31:27.509
Everybody's seen these films
from Imperial War Museum --

00:31:27.509 --> 00:31:30.078
which has been kind of wrecked
the way they've done it now,

00:31:30.078 --> 00:31:33.220
it's sort of too high-tech --
in London.

00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:36.269
But I leave you with just a
couple thoughts.

00:31:36.269 --> 00:31:39.807
The Battle of the Somme in 1916
that started on July 1^(st) when

00:31:39.807 --> 00:31:43.700
they blow the whistle and say,
"Over the top, guys."

00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:47.888
There are more British soldiers
killed and wounded in the first

00:31:47.888 --> 00:31:50.660
three days of the Battle of the
Somme,

00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:53.589
S-O-M-M-E,
three days,

00:31:53.589 --> 00:31:56.244
three days,
than there were Americans

00:31:56.244 --> 00:31:58.460
killed in World War I,
Korea,

00:31:58.460 --> 00:32:00.509
and Vietnam combined.
 

00:32:00.509 --> 00:32:02.348
In three days.
 

00:32:02.348 --> 00:32:06.130
Where are the great British
leaders of the 1920s and the

00:32:06.130 --> 00:32:06.680
1930s?
 

00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:07.808
They're all dead.
 

00:32:07.808 --> 00:32:10.943
They're hung up on that old
barbed wire, as one of the war

00:32:10.943 --> 00:32:11.769
poets put it.
 

00:32:11.769 --> 00:32:13.980
They're hung up on that old
barbed wire.

00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:19.042
One guy, a soccer player,
said, "We'll get some

00:32:19.042 --> 00:32:20.930
enthusiasm."
 

00:32:20.930 --> 00:32:25.019
He tried to dribble a ball
across these trenches,

00:32:25.019 --> 00:32:26.809
across the craters.
 

00:32:26.809 --> 00:32:27.599
He doesn't make it.
 

00:32:27.599 --> 00:32:29.410
He's killed.
 

00:32:29.410 --> 00:32:32.342
In 1914 on Christmas Day,
the Germans and the British

00:32:32.342 --> 00:32:34.880
soldiers, some would say,
"Enough of this

00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:36.460
stuff" for the day.
 

00:32:36.460 --> 00:32:37.490
They sing to each other.
 

00:32:37.490 --> 00:32:39.630
They actually play soccer;
they play football.

00:32:39.630 --> 00:32:41.502
In 1915, a British soldier
said, "Let's do the same

00:32:41.502 --> 00:32:41.980
thing."
 

00:32:41.980 --> 00:32:44.690
They put him against the wall
and shoot him.

00:32:44.690 --> 00:32:49.119
The horror of the war
transforms Europe,

00:32:49.119 --> 00:32:51.960
every aspect of Europe.
 

00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:55.708
It's impossible to understand
the growth of the agrarian sort

00:32:55.708 --> 00:32:58.519
of semi-fascist regimes in
Eastern Europe,

00:32:58.519 --> 00:33:03.383
very much under Nazi influence,
without understanding World War

00:33:03.383 --> 00:33:03.630
I.
 

00:33:03.630 --> 00:33:06.750
The war that was supposed to
end all wars;

00:33:06.750 --> 00:33:11.160
of course, it doesn't do that
at all.

00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:15.250
That's a big stop on our agenda
as well.

00:33:15.250 --> 00:33:17.482
We did used to read All
Quiet in the Western Front,

00:33:17.482 --> 00:33:18.578
but everybody's read that.
 

00:33:18.578 --> 00:33:21.435
Then we read Robert Graves'
rather long and self-indulgent

00:33:21.435 --> 00:33:22.890
Goodbye to All That.
 

00:33:22.890 --> 00:33:25.190
That was pretty long,
so we don't do that.

00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:28.108
But we will try to rock.
 

00:33:28.108 --> 00:33:33.390
Let me just read you my poem
and then you can go.

00:33:33.390 --> 00:33:35.990
Well, you can do whatever you
want, but anyway.

00:33:35.990 --> 00:33:36.730
I remember this.
 

00:33:36.730 --> 00:33:40.943
I remember reading this poem
back at University of Michigan

00:33:40.943 --> 00:33:44.650
at 2:00 on a Saturday,
trying to figure out what I'd

00:33:44.650 --> 00:33:46.539
done the night before.
 

00:33:46.539 --> 00:33:48.798
But, anyway, no.
 

00:33:48.798 --> 00:33:53.358
This is Brecht,
the great East German poet.

00:33:53.358 --> 00:33:55.980
It's called "A Worker
Reads History."

00:33:55.980 --> 00:33:58.603
Let me begin by saying that
we're going to study

00:33:58.603 --> 00:34:01.336
"great,"
I mean really "great"

00:34:01.336 --> 00:34:03.380
men,
"great" women.

00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:04.730
Hitler is obviously not a great
man.

00:34:04.730 --> 00:34:06.858
He's awful, just awful.
 

00:34:06.858 --> 00:34:09.980
But the people who are thought
to have made history:

00:34:09.980 --> 00:34:12.550
Napoleon, Peter the Great,
other people.

00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:16.563
I do talk about the folks that
you read about in textbooks,

00:34:16.563 --> 00:34:17.739
including mine.
 

00:34:17.739 --> 00:34:21.106
But I ask the same question and
pose to you the same question

00:34:21.106 --> 00:34:22.230
that Brecht poses.
 

00:34:22.230 --> 00:34:24.940
It's a short poem,
so just hang on.

00:34:24.940 --> 00:34:28.210
Who built the seven gates of
Thebes?

00:34:28.210 --> 00:34:31.989
The books are filled with the
names of kings.

00:34:31.989 --> 00:34:35.768
Was it kings who hauled the
craggy blocks of stone?

00:34:35.768 --> 00:34:39.559
And Babylon so many times
destroyed.

00:34:39.559 --> 00:34:43.590
Who built the city up each time?
 

00:34:43.590 --> 00:34:49.478
In which of Lima's houses,
The city glittering with gold,

00:34:49.478 --> 00:34:52.119
lived those who built it?
 

00:34:52.119 --> 00:34:55.550
In the evening when the Chinese
wall was finished

00:34:55.550 --> 00:34:58.260
Where did the masons go?
 

00:34:58.260 --> 00:35:01.730
Imperial Rome
Is full of arcs of triumph.

00:35:01.730 --> 00:35:03.389
Who reared them up?
 

00:35:03.389 --> 00:35:06.869
Over whom
Did the Caesars triumph?

00:35:06.869 --> 00:35:10.139
Byzantium lives in song.
 

00:35:10.139 --> 00:35:12.829
Were all her dwellings palaces?
 

00:35:12.829 --> 00:35:16.710
And even in Atlantis of the
legend

00:35:16.710 --> 00:35:23.530
The night the sea rushed in,
The drowning men still bellowed

00:35:23.530 --> 00:35:25.460
for their slaves.
 

00:35:25.460 --> 00:35:29.179
Young Alexander conquered India.
 

00:35:29.179 --> 00:35:31.250
He alone?
 

00:35:31.250 --> 00:35:33.079
Caesar beat the Gauls.
 

00:35:33.079 --> 00:35:35.409
Was there not even a cook in
his army?

00:35:35.409 --> 00:35:38.510
Philip of Spain wept as his
fleet

00:35:38.510 --> 00:35:41.409
Was sunk and destroyed.
 

00:35:41.409 --> 00:35:43.480
Were there no other tears?
 

00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:48.230
Frederick the Great triumphed
in the Seven Years' War.

00:35:48.230 --> 00:35:50.349
Who triumphed with him?
 

00:35:50.349 --> 00:35:53.420
Each page a victory.
 

00:35:53.420 --> 00:35:56.829
At whose expense the victory
ball?

00:35:56.829 --> 00:36:00.179
Every ten years a great man.
 

00:36:00.179 --> 00:36:03.110
Who paid the piper?
 

00:36:03.110 --> 00:36:05.099
So many particulars.
 

00:36:05.099 --> 00:36:07.730
So many questions.
 

00:36:07.730 --> 00:36:11.980
If you hang with us this
semester, we'll get at some of

00:36:11.980 --> 00:36:12.610
those.
 

00:36:12.610 --> 00:36:14.869
See you.
 

00:36:14.869 --> 00:36:16.530
Thank you.
 

00:36:16.530 --> 00:36:18.099
Thank you.

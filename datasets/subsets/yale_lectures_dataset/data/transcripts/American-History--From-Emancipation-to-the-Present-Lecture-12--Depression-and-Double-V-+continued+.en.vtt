00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.467
In the last lecture I set
the terms for the week's

00:00:04.467 --> 00:00:07.500
discussion, those being
retrenchment and political

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.300
advancement.&nbsp; I wanted
to make clear on Monday's

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.067
lecture that the Scottsboro
Boys and the Black Cabinet

00:00:14.067 --> 00:00:17.100
represent two ends of a
spectrum of political

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.300
possibilities of black
America in the 1930s.&nbsp; They

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.400
are together
articulating a new voice,

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.567
a new vehicle to
communicate responses to and

00:00:27.567 --> 00:00:29.100
articulations of
possibilities,

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.267
but coming from very
different places in very

00:00:33.267 --> 00:00:35.767
different ways.&nbsp; The
Scottsboro Boys reaches back

00:00:35.767 --> 00:00:39.400
to a past of social
control, certainly,

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.100
but also representing in
the Scottsboro Boys case,

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.300
in the way the Communist
Party gets involved,

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.800
that there's a new mentality
at work in black America,

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.067
and new values
in--or being seen--the,

00:00:52.067 --> 00:00:54.900
the, the accused being
seen as commodities on a

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.700
political battlefield.&nbsp;
And the Black Cabinet

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.067
represented the best
possible world of new

00:01:01.067 --> 00:01:04.500
political insiderism
at the national level,

00:01:07.267 --> 00:01:08.600
in a different way
than the Scottsboro Boys,

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.567
serving as important symbols
of blacks' centrality to the

00:01:13.567 --> 00:01:16.300
political realm.&nbsp; Now I
wanted to continue the

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.400
discussion along those
lines and to--these--I'm

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.567
sorry--these are the themes
for this week.&nbsp; I want to

00:01:22.567 --> 00:01:24.500
continue the discussion
along these lines,

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.200
but focusing upon the
National Negro Congress,

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.700
the Marian Anderson
Easter Sunday Concert,

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.500
and the March on Washington
movement.&nbsp; This--the events

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.200
for this lecture are
essentially the second half

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.900
of the 1930s.&nbsp; But it's
important to realize,

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.900
the things I was talking
about in Monday's lecture

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.700
are overlapping, many of
the events I'm talking about

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.667
today.&nbsp; These are all
happening in the course of

00:01:50.667 --> 00:01:53.667
the decade, but certainly at
some point all happening at

00:01:53.667 --> 00:01:58.400
the same time.&nbsp; Let me start
with the National Negro

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:05.400
Congress.&nbsp; The National
Negro Congress--for some

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.000
reason, this is a lecture I
wrote down a lot of notes

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.500
for you guys, and I'm not
sure really why.&nbsp; Maybe I

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.267
was being generous.&nbsp; I
don't know.&nbsp; Anyway,

00:02:12.267 --> 00:02:16.067
the National Negro Congress
has its start in the

00:02:16.067 --> 00:02:18.467
National Industrial League.

00:02:18.467 --> 00:02:22.500
It forms in 1933.&nbsp; This is a
response to the development

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.100
of, well, Franklin
Roosevelt's New Deal and

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.500
agencies like the
National Recovery--well,

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.767
an early incarnation, the
National Industrial Recovery

00:02:31.767 --> 00:02:34.767
Act, and how this
organization was not going

00:02:34.767 --> 00:02:41.000
to care about setting wage,
setting minimum wages for

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.167
agricultural workers or for
domestic workers.&nbsp; And two

00:02:44.167 --> 00:02:45.867
men get together, Robert C.

00:02:45.867 --> 00:02:47.167
Weaver and John P.

00:02:47.167 --> 00:02:52.267
Davis, and start--black men,
and start testifying before

00:02:52.267 --> 00:02:53.400
Congress, before
the Senate, saying,

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.700
you know, "This
is an abomination.

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.867
You're completely
wri--writing out or,

00:02:57.867 --> 00:03:01.300
or disregarding those areas
that have the most important

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.967
or significant black
involvement."&nbsp; The Negro

00:03:03.967 --> 00:03:07.000
Industrial League is
a two-man operation,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.400
but they fashion themselves
as an umbrella group

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:15.367
representing black interests
across the country.&nbsp; It--It

00:03:15.367 --> 00:03:18.500
exists pretty much only in
passing.&nbsp; Now the important

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.700
part of it is that Robert C.

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.467
Weaver is seen as
doing such a great job,

00:03:23.467 --> 00:03:25.600
having recent--recently
received his J.D.

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.700
from Harvard, he gets
incorporated into the

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.567
federal government, and is
one of the very first race

00:03:30.567 --> 00:03:33.900
advisors.&nbsp; So that's
where the Nation--the Negro

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.800
Industrial League is
important for bringing in

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.967
one of its own into the
federal bureaucracy.&nbsp; The

00:03:39.967 --> 00:03:40.967
other person, John P.

00:03:40.967 --> 00:03:43.900
Davis, remains an outsider,
and we'll be spending more

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.800
time on Davis's activities
in the course of this

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.700
lecture.&nbsp; Davis organizes,
in the wake of the Negro

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.367
Industrial
League's collapse,

00:03:52.367 --> 00:03:54.600
the Joint Committee for
National Recovery.&nbsp; It lasts

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.100
only for two
years.&nbsp; It, too,

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.000
fashions itself as an
umbrella organization

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.267
representing blacks' needs
from across the country.&nbsp;

00:04:02.267 --> 00:04:03.967
Now this is a
self-representation.

00:04:03.967 --> 00:04:06.867
I mean these were not, you
do not--You do not have all

00:04:06.867 --> 00:04:09.167
sorts of
black-run organizations,

00:04:09.167 --> 00:04:10.167
running to John P.

00:04:10.167 --> 00:04:12.300
Davis and the Joint
Committee for National

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:14.200
Recovery, which is
essentially him and an

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.300
office and a couple
of figurehead people.&nbsp;

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:20.367
Davis--well they
aren't running to Davis,

00:04:20.367 --> 00:04:25.100
because one, this is a new
kid on the block basically.&nbsp;

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.100
They're still looking
at organizations like,

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.200
you know, churches,
business associations,

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:34.200
the NAACP, for example,
but the Joint Committee for

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:38.067
National Recovery does at
least one important thing

00:04:38.067 --> 00:04:42.467
before it collapses, and it
organizes a conference at

00:04:42.467 --> 00:04:46.500
Howard University.&nbsp; And
this is a conference that is

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.300
dedicated to trying to
understand the economic

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:54.000
plight of African Americans
during the Great Depression

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
and the New Deal.&nbsp; Now
it's just a conference,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.200
but it brings--but it's
remarkable that it brings

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.300
together people from a
wide range of political

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:09.967
backgrounds.&nbsp; It brings
together labor organizers,

00:05:09.967 --> 00:05:12.300
agricultural
workers, domestic workers,

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.567
you know, people who are
doing work on the ground.&nbsp;

00:05:14.567 --> 00:05:16.000
It brings together
intellectuals like W.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.000
E.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.000
B.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.700
Du Bois, who's becoming a
Marxist and talking economic

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:21.967
cooperatives
along race lines,

00:05:21.967 --> 00:05:24.600
something actually in
some ways looking similar to

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:25.600
Booker T.

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.867
Washington's ideologies.&nbsp; It
brings together leaders of

00:05:28.867 --> 00:05:30.500
the Communist Party,
the Workers' Party,

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:33.600
the Socialist Party.&nbsp; It
brings together people from

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.100
the federal
government, like Robert C.

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:38.700
Weaver now, all asking the
question: what is the status

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:44.200
of the Negro in, in the
New Deal?&nbsp; And the result of

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:48.300
this conference was--well,
many things came out of it.&nbsp;

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.667
One, scathing attack on
the New Deal for the way it

00:05:50.667 --> 00:05:53.300
ignored blacks'
conditions on the ground,

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:57.700
in ways I outlined briefly
on Monday.&nbsp; It launched an

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:00.900
investigation into communist
activities at Howard

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:03.067
University, Howard
University then essentially

00:06:03.067 --> 00:06:05.500
being funded by the
federal government,

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:07.200
and essentially now
still receiving most of its

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:10.000
support from the
federal government.&nbsp; An

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.600
investigation was
launched into the communist

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.100
activities at Howard,
and certainly there were

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:16.600
communists on the faculty
at Howard and certainly

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:19.167
socialists as well,
and certainly a lot of

00:06:19.167 --> 00:06:22.000
sympathizers.&nbsp; So there was
an attempt to silence and

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.867
actually shut down the
university as a result of

00:06:24.867 --> 00:06:26.500
this conference.&nbsp;
And most importantly,

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:28.500
it establishes a group
called the National Negro

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:31.867
Congress.&nbsp; I forgot
that slide.&nbsp; Okay,

00:06:31.867 --> 00:06:35.567
those are the notes for
what I just told you.&nbsp; The

00:06:35.567 --> 00:06:39.700
National Negro Congress
actually does turn into that

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:43.100
kind of umbrella
organization that the Negro

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:45.500
Industrial League and the
Joint Committee for National

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:50.600
Recovery all aspired to be.&nbsp;
The National Negro Congress

00:06:52.767 --> 00:06:54.967
forms out of a call, I
mean the Howard University

00:06:54.967 --> 00:06:57.567
Conference, "We
need to organize a,

00:06:57.567 --> 00:07:00.000
a national
political action group,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.700
 and it becomes the
National Negro Congress,

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:07.100
formed in 1936.&nbsp; The
congress convenes for the

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:10.000
first time in
Chicago in '36,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.600
where it's met where--with
police harassment,

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:16.800
due to alleged communistic,
communist participation.&nbsp; A.

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:18.667
Philip Randolph, who
we'll be talking about more

00:07:18.667 --> 00:07:20.300
towards the end
of the lecture,

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:22.100
but for now, just to know
the most important--Bless

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:23.100
you.

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:26.367
&nbsp;The most important labor
leader in black America,

00:07:26.367 --> 00:07:31.300
is elected its first
president.&nbsp; And the National

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:33.300
Negro Congress
establishes--sorry,

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:45.500
I'm all off on my slides
here today.&nbsp; Excuse me.&nbsp; It

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:51.000
establishes a slate that's
concerning civil rights,

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.700
women's rights,
labor's rights,

00:07:56.567 --> 00:08:01.800
aid to farmers and
sharecroppers.&nbsp; It calls for

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:06.000
an anti-lynching law; it
calls for voting rights,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.267
educational opportunities,
social and unemployment

00:08:11.267 --> 00:08:14.800
insurance, and opposition
to war and fascism.&nbsp; Civil

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:16.400
rights, women's
rights, labor's rights,

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:17.867
aid to farmers
and sharecroppers,

00:08:17.867 --> 00:08:19.800
anti-lynching
law, voting rights,

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:22.800
education opportunities,
social un--and unemployment

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:27.967
insurance and an oppression
to war and fascism.&nbsp; If you

00:08:27.967 --> 00:08:31.700
think back to a few
weeks earlier in the course,

00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:34.100
a large part of this slate
that the National Negro

00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:39.300
Congress calls for is
identical to the slate,

00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:43.900
to the manifesto, that the
Niagara Movement calls for

00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:51.167
some thirty years earlier,
not quite thirty years.&nbsp; The

00:08:51.167 --> 00:08:53.467
point is, a lot of the
issues haven't changed,

00:08:53.467 --> 00:08:57.000
despite some real
changes in those thirty,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:03.967
thirty-one years, excuse
me.&nbsp; Now the National Negro

00:09:03.967 --> 00:09:06.867
Congress was not just made
up of black folks getting

00:09:06.867 --> 00:09:10.967
together calling for a slate
of a progressive future.&nbsp; It

00:09:10.967 --> 00:09:12.567
is, as the slide
up here indicates,

00:09:12.567 --> 00:09:15.767
a cross section of black
groups and white labor,

00:09:15.767 --> 00:09:17.667
of all different kinds
of groups as far as black

00:09:17.667 --> 00:09:21.000
business bureaus,
black churches,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:26.167
black labor organizations.&nbsp;
The congress actively courts

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:30.600
white labor in this regard,
especially the Congress of

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:37.000
Industrial Organization, and
it sets out this agenda for

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.267
change on the
ground.&nbsp; It has,

00:09:39.267 --> 00:09:41.500
more than anything
else, a labor orientation,

00:09:44.267 --> 00:09:46.267
despite even business groups
being involved.&nbsp; It's going

00:09:46.267 --> 00:09:49.200
to change things on the
ground.&nbsp; And the person

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:50.200
organizing--sort of--A.

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:51.200
Philip Randolph
is the president,

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:53.767
but the person doing the
work on a day-to-day basis

00:09:53.767 --> 00:09:54.767
is John P.

00:09:54.767 --> 00:09:56.967
Davis.&nbsp; He was there at
the Negro Industrial League,

00:09:56.967 --> 00:09:59.200
there at the Joint Committee
for National Recovery,

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:01.200
and he's really running the
National Negro Congress.&nbsp;

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:03.500
And he runs it for
the length of the NNC's

00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:08.700
existence, which is not
quite a decade.&nbsp; Now one of

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:13.600
the first things the
Congress does successfully,

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:16.600
aside from just meeting, is
establish a Southern Negro

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:19.100
Youth Congress, essentially
the youth arm of the

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:26.600
Congress.&nbsp; The Southern
Negro Youth Con--Congress

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:30.967
had its inaugural conference
half a year late in

00:10:30.967 --> 00:10:33.400
February, 1937 in
Richmond, Virginia,

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:35.400
and it makes its
headquarters there for a

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:40.867
number of years.&nbsp; With the
guidance of the Southern

00:10:40.867 --> 00:10:42.600
Negro Youth
Conference leaders,

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:45.167
it becomes a permanent
organization and almost

00:10:45.167 --> 00:10:48.467
immediately organizes five
thousand tobacco workers

00:10:48.467 --> 00:10:50.900
into the Tobacco Stemmers
and Laborers Industrial

00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:58.200
union.&nbsp; Very soon after, an
SNYC leads a sit-down strike

00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:01.500
in--at a Virginia Tobacco
Company and garn--and,

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:04.200
and gets wage increases
of twenty to thirty-three

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:07.800
percent.&nbsp; This is
remarkable.&nbsp; The Southern

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:09.300
Negro Youth
Congress, these are,

00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:13.600
these are people your age
and a little bit older,

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:15.667
going down to
Richmond, Virginia,

00:11:15.667 --> 00:11:18.567
the heart of
the Confederacy,

00:11:18.567 --> 00:11:22.200
and organizing black workers
into a union and getting

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:24.967
wages--wage increases for
them.&nbsp; It's nothing really

00:11:24.967 --> 00:11:29.800
short of
astonishing.&nbsp; By 1939,

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:33.100
when the third annual
conference of the SNYC

00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:37.200
gathers in Birm--gathers,
they meet in Birmingham,

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:38.700
Alabama.&nbsp; Over six
hundred delegates are in

00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:42.400
attendance.&nbsp; It's the
largest conference to date.&nbsp;

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:45.300
The themes of the conference
revolved around citizenship,

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:48.600
equal opportunity,
and black culture.

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:50.900
These are themes that by now
must be familiar to all of

00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:52.500
you.&nbsp; I've been talking
about it during this course,

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:56.867
after all.&nbsp; Again, themes
from the Niagara Movement,

00:11:56.867 --> 00:11:57.900
but in this case
with the students,

00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:00.700
a different type of cultural
emphasis.&nbsp; I think a

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:06.467
hangover, in a sense, from
the Harlem Renaissance.&nbsp; But

00:12:06.467 --> 00:12:09.100
the Southern Negro Youth
Congress was not another

00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:14.600
middle-class black
venture.&nbsp; I'm thinking,

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:16.600
too, that's sort of the
cultural producers of the

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:19.900
Renaissance.&nbsp; It espoused
a democratic socialist

00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:25.600
vision.&nbsp; It was militantly
interracial.&nbsp; It offered its

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:28.567
full support to the Congress
Industrial Organization,

00:12:28.567 --> 00:12:31.000
that breakaway set of
labor unions that actually

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.200
welcomed black workers.

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:35.200
And, this is the
most important part,

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:38.067
it's very quietly
Communist.&nbsp; The Southern

00:12:38.067 --> 00:12:43.167
Negro Youth Congress
moves its headquarters from

00:12:43.167 --> 00:12:47.200
Richmond down to Birmingham
and establishes a watchdog

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:51.267
presence in the Deep South.&nbsp;
It wages suffrage campaigns,

00:12:51.267 --> 00:12:53.700
you know, trying to
get people to vote,

00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:58.300
anti-poll tax campaigns.&nbsp;
It tries to fight against

00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:02.067
police brutality.&nbsp; Now
the Southern Negro Youth

00:13:02.067 --> 00:13:04.800
Congress is important
because of its Communist

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:07.500
involvement, certainly, but
also because you can see it

00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:10.500
as a preface to the
civil rights activities that

00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:12.900
defined Birmingham
some twenty years later,

00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:14.667
and that as
we'll see next week,

00:13:14.667 --> 00:13:19.467
you start seeing a lot of
these kinds of activities in

00:13:19.467 --> 00:13:21.800
other places
throughout the South,

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:23.500
through other
organizations.&nbsp; Now I'll

00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:25.267
ex--expand upon
this point later on.

00:13:25.267 --> 00:13:27.567
It's very important.&nbsp;
The Southern Negro Youth

00:13:27.567 --> 00:13:29.967
Congress is but one
example that forces,

00:13:29.967 --> 00:13:31.900
if you think about it,
forces a re-periodization of

00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:34.167
the Civil Rights Movement.&nbsp;
I'll leave that alone there

00:13:34.167 --> 00:13:40.100
for a moment.&nbsp; Well, the
SNYC begins to fade as we

00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:43.600
get into the 1940s.&nbsp; Its
male leaders go off to

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:49.767
fight; its female leaders
do not remain youthful.&nbsp; I

00:13:49.767 --> 00:13:51.000
mean, neither do
the men of course,

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.600
but the women are still
at home.&nbsp; It's no longer a

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:55.600
"youth congress."&nbsp;
They're not regenerating

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:59.800
themselves.&nbsp; And the
whispering about its linkage

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:03.500
to the Communist Party
really prevents it from

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:08.500
becoming a major political
force after the Soviet-Nazi

00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:11.600
pact in 1939, when the
Soviet--when Hitler and

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:13.200
Stalin get together, saying,
"We won't fight against each

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:17.500
other," which alienates
a lot of people who were

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:20.000
supporting the Communist
Party in the United

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:26.000
States.&nbsp;Meanwhile, back in
the National Negro Congress,

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.167
I'll roll back the clock
a few years.&nbsp; Randolph,

00:14:30.167 --> 00:14:31.167
A.

00:14:31.167 --> 00:14:32.167
Phil--A.

00:14:32.167 --> 00:14:33.300
Philip Randolph,
he's the president,

00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:37.967
is hearing more whispering
about Communist involvement

00:14:37.967 --> 00:14:39.700
in the National
Negro Congress,

00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:43.400
and he's not happy about
it.&nbsp; He fights--he denies it

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:45.300
at first, goes,
"No, we are, you know,

00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:47.700
we are an independent
organization.&nbsp; Even though

00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:50.667
we've modeled ourselves,
modeled ourselves after

00:14:50.667 --> 00:14:54.800
Communist ideologies as
far as developing a Popular

00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:57.367
Front of all people from
different kinds of places

00:14:57.367 --> 00:14:59.600
coming together to
fight towards one goal,

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:03.900
we are not Communists."&nbsp; But
then it becomes clear that

00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:06.967
Communists have infiltrated
the National Negro Congress,

00:15:06.967 --> 00:15:08.967
mainly through the Congress
of Industrial Organization.&nbsp;

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:15.700
So white labor organizers,
Randolph concludes,

00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:17.700
are bringing Communism
into this organization,

00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:24.400
and he wants no
part of it.&nbsp; Randolph,

00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:26.500
after denying
it for a while,

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:29.367
goes to the national
convention in 1940 where

00:15:29.367 --> 00:15:31.400
he's going to stand up
in front of the Congress,

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:35.067
the National Negro
Congress and resign,

00:15:35.067 --> 00:15:39.500
and resign with fire,
talking about how the

00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:44.000
Communists do not have our
best interests at heart.&nbsp;

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.367
He's basically
booed off the stage.

00:15:46.367 --> 00:15:48.000
I mean, the Communists are
now taking control of the

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.100
Negro Congress.&nbsp; And John P.

00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:52.900
Davis, where is he
through all of this?&nbsp; Well,

00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:57.400
he's--he's a
Communist actually.&nbsp; And so,

00:15:57.400 --> 00:15:59.500
you know, he's caught in
a rock and a hard place,

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:00.867
but sides with the
Congress.&nbsp; And that's where

00:16:00.867 --> 00:16:04.667
he, that's where he
continues to reside for a

00:16:04.667 --> 00:16:09.267
handful more years.&nbsp;
Now that's in 1940,

00:16:09.267 --> 00:16:10.900
and Randolph's about to
go off and start something

00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:13.567
quite different in response
to his departure from the

00:16:13.567 --> 00:16:16.100
Nation--National Negro
Congress.&nbsp; And we'll get to

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:19.100
that towards the end of the
lecture.&nbsp; While all of this

00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:21.600
is going on--all of this
meaning the National Negro

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:25.800
Congress becoming organized,
having its conferences,

00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:30.700
turning more towards
Communism and then Randolph

00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:36.967
breaking from it--you have a
series of events happening

00:16:36.967 --> 00:16:41.300
on the cultural front,
cultural and political

00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:46.400
front, that sort of
galvanizes black opinion and

00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:49.900
leads to a new set of
political possibilities,

00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:51.567
and that's the Marian
Anderson Easter Sunday

00:16:51.567 --> 00:16:56.200
concert in 1939.&nbsp;
Marian Anderson,

00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:59.300
black woman, regarded as
one of the world's greatest

00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:03.567
living contraltos.&nbsp;
She's--she sings opera.&nbsp; Her

00:17:03.567 --> 00:17:08.000
case is well-known,
partly for her international

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.867
stature, partly for the
other high-profile whites

00:17:10.867 --> 00:17:12.600
who are involved in it,
and partly for the symbolic

00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:16.000
significance attached to the
controversy.&nbsp; Let me give

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.700
you the history behind
it, and the controversy,

00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:23.100
and explain its
significance.&nbsp; Howard

00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:27.467
University School of
Music had regularly been

00:17:27.467 --> 00:17:30.567
scheduling Marian
Anders--Marian Anderson to

00:17:30.567 --> 00:17:33.600
come back from Europe.&nbsp;
She was born in the U.S.

00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:36.500
but couldn't establish a
career in the U.S.&nbsp; She goes

00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:39.167
off to Europe and
becomes a fan--a,

00:17:39.167 --> 00:17:44.800
a superstar in Europe.&nbsp;
But Howard School of Music

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:47.400
starts--is schedule--as her
star is rising in Europe,

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:49.300
is scheduling her to
come back to the U.S.

00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:55.767
to give conf--concerts, and
they've been on campus.&nbsp; As

00:17:55.767 --> 00:17:58.267
her popularity rises, they
can't house her on campus

00:17:58.267 --> 00:18:02.500
any more, and
in 1936 and '37,

00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:04.967
the Howard concert had been
moved to a local black high

00:18:04.967 --> 00:18:12.267
school auditorium.&nbsp; By 1938,
Marian Anderson's fees are

00:18:12.267 --> 00:18:14.300
such, and the
demand is such,

00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:17.600
they need a larger venue in
order to spon--to hold the

00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:24.167
concert.&nbsp; They went into the
black commercial district,

00:18:24.167 --> 00:18:26.600
which is right
next to Howard,

00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:28.200
went to a theater that was
bigger than the black high

00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:31.300
school
auditorium, had it there.

00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:33.100
In 1939, the
fees are greater,

00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:35.100
the demand is greater.&nbsp;
Where are we going to have a

00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:42.900
concert?&nbsp; The School of
Music goes to the Daughters

00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:46.300
of the American Revolution,
the DAR.&nbsp; The Daughters of

00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:50.500
the American Revolution,
a social political

00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:53.300
organization--I think more
social in this moment until

00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:57.567
it becomes politicized--of
women who can date back

00:18:57.567 --> 00:18:59.667
their lineage to people who
fought in the Revolutionary

00:18:59.667 --> 00:19:04.100
War.&nbsp; At that time and
really only until the last

00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:07.800
ten or fifteen years, a very
white organization and very

00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:13.300
conservative organization.&nbsp;
And they manage Constitution

00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:15.800
Hall, which is the largest
venue in the city.&nbsp; It's

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:20.500
still there today.&nbsp; Well,
they go to the Daughters of

00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:24.200
the American Revolution,
the School of Music does,

00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:26.000
"We'd like to have Marian
Anderson performing in,

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.467
in Constitution Hall.&nbsp; Would
you let her sing there?"&nbsp;

00:19:29.467 --> 00:19:33.300
Now the DAR maintained a
strictly segregated policy.&nbsp;

00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:34.567
Now in D.C.

00:19:34.567 --> 00:19:38.000
theaters, it was quite
common to have segregated

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.000
audiences.&nbsp; If
blacks were allowed in,

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:45.767
they'd only be allowed up in
the balcony.&nbsp; You could have

00:19:45.767 --> 00:19:49.600
blacks on stage always,
because they "dance so well,

00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:53.267
 they "sing so beautifully"
as the stereotype goes.&nbsp; But

00:19:53.267 --> 00:19:56.300
DAR was different: no blacks
in the audience period,

00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:59.200
and no blacks on stage.&nbsp; It
was an all-white venue all

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:06.367
the time.&nbsp; The Howard
University School of Music,

00:20:06.367 --> 00:20:09.300
rebuffed by this, goes to
a local white high school,

00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:11.600
which has a much larger
auditorium than the black

00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:14.800
high school that had been
used before and the Rialto,

00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:18.267
and it's rebuffed
again.&nbsp; Black leaders in the

00:20:18.267 --> 00:20:20.267
District then form the
Marian Anderson Citizens

00:20:20.267 --> 00:20:24.267
Committee to fight these
decisions.&nbsp; It's a coalition

00:20:24.267 --> 00:20:27.800
of local clergy, teachers,
civic and fraternal

00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:34.500
organizations, trying to
basically knock down these

00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:39.767
doors.&nbsp; Behind the
scenes, however,

00:20:39.767 --> 00:20:45.500
a man named Charles Houston,
a lawyer at this point for

00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:49.967
the NAACP--he's the first
general counsel.&nbsp; He had

00:20:49.967 --> 00:20:52.500
been brought to Howard a
decade earlier to reorganize

00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:55.067
its law school and starts
teaching the first civil

00:20:55.067 --> 00:20:57.100
rights law
classes in the country,

00:20:57.100 --> 00:21:01.300
the law school does.&nbsp;
Charles Houston gets

00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:06.000
involved behind the scenes,
as well as the NAACP.&nbsp; They

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.600
start organizing
mass meetings,

00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:12.600
letters of support start
being sent in to these

00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:16.000
different organizations,
and they're focusing on the

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:20.000
white high school.&nbsp; They go
to--They're going to the,

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.667
the Board of Education.

00:21:21.667 --> 00:21:24.467
The Board of
Education says, "Okay,

00:21:24.467 --> 00:21:25.600
we'll, we'll come to a
compromise on this.&nbsp; We will

00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:29.200
allow Marian Anderson to
perform at the white high

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:31.900
school, Central High.

00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:37.300
We'll let it be integrated.&nbsp;
But this will be a one-time

00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:40.500
event and you may
not use this"--you,

00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:42.100
the citizens
organizing the committee,

00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:44.400
and quietly, Charles
Houston--"you may not use

00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:47.200
this as a precedent from
challenging separate but

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:52.400
equal educational systems in
the District of Columbia."&nbsp;

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:53.900
Well, the fact is, that's
what Houston was trying to

00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:55.900
do the whole time,
once he got involved,

00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:57.800
because this is a great way
to break down the color line

00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:00.700
in the school system,
using Marian Anderson as a

00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:04.200
symbolic vehicle.&nbsp; It's a
compromise the protestors

00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:07.100
refused--refused to accept
and the School of Board

00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:09.900
called their bluff
[laughs]--the Board of

00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:14.300
Education called their
bluff.&nbsp; So the NAACP and

00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:18.200
Charles Houston go to the
White House.&nbsp; They go to the

00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:22.000
White House via
Mary McLeod Bethune,

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.700
talked about on Monday,
who gets them to have an

00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:27.767
audience with
Eleanor Roosevelt;

00:22:27.767 --> 00:22:30.000
Eleanor Roosevelt
who's a member of the DAR,

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.400
incredibly popular
syndicated-syndicated

00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:37.067
columnist.&nbsp; Approaches
the DAR and they tell her,

00:22:37.067 --> 00:22:38.967
"No, we're not
breaking this policy,

00:22:38.967 --> 00:22:43.200
 and she resigns in protest
and writes a very famous

00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:50.700
column about this, and her
embarrassment for the DAR.&nbsp;

00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:53.800
Eleanor Roosevelt
talks to Harold Ickes,

00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:58.500
Secretary of the
Interior, himself,

00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:00.100
like Eleanor Roosevelt,
considered a "friend of the

00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:04.200
race," as what the phrase
was at the time.&nbsp; Harold

00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:07.067
Ickes steps in and arranges
a concert on Easter Sunday

00:23:07.067 --> 00:23:11.800
in 1939 for Marian Anderson
at the Lincoln Memorial.&nbsp; As

00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:12.900
the Secretary
of the Interior,

00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:16.700
he, he, he controlled the
federal land and controlled

00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:18.400
what happened on the
National Mall.&nbsp; On the day

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:24.400
in question, Ickes steps
up to the microphone and

00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:30.700
introduces Marian Anderson.&nbsp;
One prominent journal

00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:33.000
remarked after
the fact that,

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.200
I'm quoting here, "The
brevity and force of his

00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:38.500
speech was destined to
rival Lincoln's Gettysburg

00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:41.100
Address."&nbsp; Now whether
that's true or not is

00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:42.500
a--well I don't think
we remember this speech,

00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:45.067
so it didn't really rival
the Gettysburg Address.&nbsp; But

00:23:45.067 --> 00:23:51.500
it is short and it is
powerful.&nbsp; This is what he

00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:53.767
says here, one excerpt
of what he says: "Genius,

00:23:53.767 --> 00:23:57.000
like justice, is
blind.&nbsp; For Genius,

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:02.300
with the tip of her wings,
has touched this woman,

00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:08.700
who, if it had not been for
the great mind of Jefferson,

00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:14.600
if it had not been for
the great heart of Lincoln,

00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:21.000
would not be able to stand
among us today as a free

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:24.200
individual in a
free land.&nbsp; Genius.

00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:27.267
Genius draws no color line."

00:24:27.267 --> 00:24:30.500
You start hearing a plane
flying overhead there.&nbsp; It

00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:32.600
was something of a
circus atmosphere.&nbsp; He says,

00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:36.400
"Genius, like justice,
is blind.&nbsp; For Genius has

00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:39.400
touched with the tip of
her wings this woman,

00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:41.600
who, if it had not been for
the great mind of Jefferson,

00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:44.600
if it had not been for
the great heart of Lincoln,

00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:47.567
would not be able to stand
among us today as a free

00:24:47.567 --> 00:24:51.800
individual in a
free land.&nbsp; Genius.

00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:54.600
Genius draws no color line."

00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:56.567
It's a powerful statement
coming from a representative

00:24:56.567 --> 00:25:02.067
of the federal government.&nbsp;
Now four hours before Ickes

00:25:02.067 --> 00:25:05.300
steps to the microphone,
four hours before the

00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:08.600
concert begins, people start
arriving at the National

00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:13.000
Mall and the Lincoln
Memorial.&nbsp; And what they

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:14.900
find there is really
quite remarkable.&nbsp; D.C.

00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:19.267
is a very segregated city
during this era.&nbsp; What they

00:25:19.267 --> 00:25:23.600
find is an absence, an
absence of "colored only"

00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:25.467
sections, an
absence of, you know,

00:25:25.467 --> 00:25:31.200
"White section.&nbsp; No colored
allowed."&nbsp; Seventy-five

00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:34.600
thousand people
crowd the Mall,

00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:36.567
and it may not sound like a
dramatic number to you in

00:25:36.567 --> 00:25:38.600
our day of, you know,
millions showing up at the

00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:45.967
Mall, but this is historic.&nbsp;
And it's also opera,

00:25:45.967 --> 00:25:47.900
which is not known as
the people's music,

00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:51.100
right?&nbsp; Seventy-five
thousand people crowd the

00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:54.100
Mall to hear
Anderson's performance,

00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:56.500
and an untold number
of people listen to the

00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:58.400
performance on radio
around the country,

00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:02.767
aired live.&nbsp; Planes are
circling overhead trying to

00:26:02.767 --> 00:26:07.900
understand the scene that's
going on there.&nbsp; This is a

00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:12.267
famous image:
Marian Anderson,

00:26:12.267 --> 00:26:17.400
long fur coat, singing
just with piano accompanying

00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:24.300
her.&nbsp; Steps up to the
microphone and in a powerful

00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:27.200
yet dignified
rebuke to the DAR,

00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:31.467
Anderson simply
begins her concert in this

00:26:31.467 --> 00:26:38.967
way:(singing) "My
country, 'tis of thee,

00:26:38.967 --> 00:26:44.000
Sweet land of
liberty, of thee I sing;

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.300
 She sounded a
bit like that,

00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:47.300
maybe a bit
better.&nbsp; Eloquent,

00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:48.300
powerful, subtle,
undeniable.&nbsp; She is in this

00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:54.300
moment claiming the country
as much--It belongs as much

00:27:03.867 --> 00:27:07.267
to her as it belongs to the
Daughters of the American

00:27:07.267 --> 00:27:08.900
Revolution.&nbsp; Everybody there
got it.&nbsp; She didn't have to

00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:10.800
say, you know, "I'm so
glad to be here today.&nbsp; It's

00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:12.700
lovely.&nbsp; You know, D.C., how
are you?"&nbsp; You didn't have

00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:16.200
to do that kind of
stuff; simply declared,

00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:21.567
"This is my country
too."&nbsp; And in fact,

00:27:21.567 --> 00:27:25.300
as an aside, it's--the
inauguration of Barack

00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:29.100
Obama, something, I don't
know if I'll talk about it

00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:30.100
or not at the
end of the class,

00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:33.600
but when Aretha Franklin
stands up to sing "My

00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:35.167
Country, 'Tis of
Thee"--she, I mean,

00:27:35.167 --> 00:27:37.767
it's a, culturally a very
dense inauguration.&nbsp; I mean,

00:27:37.767 --> 00:27:39.500
all inaugurations are
rich with symbolism,

00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:42.100
but this one was rather
remarkable.&nbsp; She was singing

00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:44.100
"My Country, 'Tis
of Thee," for the,

00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:47.000
you know, that people would
get it in the audience,

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.600
but there's a whole other
level of understanding for

00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:52.267
those people who know
this story and what Marian

00:27:52.267 --> 00:27:54.300
Anderson did with this
particular exhortation.&nbsp; And

00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:56.300
I, I've heard, if you
watched the HBO special the

00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:58.167
day before the inauguration,
they explained some of

00:27:58.167 --> 00:28:02.200
this.&nbsp; I didn't see it; but,
and many people didn't.&nbsp; The

00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:05.667
significance of Aretha
Franklin's performance of

00:28:05.667 --> 00:28:08.200
that particular song
was lost on many folks,

00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:10.367
but it was a reckoning
back to this moment.&nbsp; The

00:28:10.367 --> 00:28:12.967
moment's important,
not just because,

00:28:12.967 --> 00:28:14.800
you know, it's a classy
way of being a civil rights

00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:17.700
protestor, but it's
important for these

00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:20.367
different reasons.&nbsp; With
Eleanor Roosevelt and Harold

00:28:20.367 --> 00:28:23.600
Ickes giving their very
public support to the,

00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:25.900
the Citizens Committee
for Marian Anderson,

00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:30.300
and for the right for
her to sing at the DAR,

00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:33.100
it suggests to African
Americans that the federal

00:28:33.100 --> 00:28:34.867
government, at
the highest levels,

00:28:34.867 --> 00:28:37.867
in the White House, "really
does care about us."&nbsp; They'd

00:28:37.867 --> 00:28:39.700
been working on the Black
Cabinet.&nbsp; That's--They've

00:28:39.700 --> 00:28:41.300
been going out and
changing things.

00:28:41.300 --> 00:28:44.067
We're now as a group
beginning to vote for

00:28:44.067 --> 00:28:47.067
Democrats anyway,
through--because of FDR.&nbsp;

00:28:47.067 --> 00:28:49.800
And now the First Lady,
the Secretary of Interior,

00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:54.767
are saying, "Genius draws
no color line."&nbsp; Of course,

00:28:54.767 --> 00:28:57.400
it's the symbolism wrapped
up in performing under the

00:28:57.400 --> 00:28:58.967
protective gaze of
the Great Emancipator.

00:28:58.967 --> 00:29:02.400
That's not lost on anybody
either.&nbsp; But it's also felt

00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:05.100
on the very local level in
ways that's lost to history

00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:07.900
often.&nbsp;When I was
working on my first book,

00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:12.700
my dissertation in fact, I
was interviewing a longtime

00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:13.700
D.C.

00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:17.000
resident.&nbsp; He was then about
eighty years old.&nbsp; And we

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:18.600
were just talking
about this era,

00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:20.700
you know, in
Washington, D.C.,

00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:23.367
and, and what it meant to be
black and struggle with the

00:29:23.367 --> 00:29:26.800
color line.&nbsp; And
this concert comes up,

00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:29.800
and he said something I've
never forgotten.&nbsp; And he

00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:32.700
says, this is a quote, it's
burned into my brain: "After

00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:34.367
that
concert"--and he was there,

00:29:34.367 --> 00:29:36.667
I should say.&nbsp;
"After that concert,

00:29:36.667 --> 00:29:39.300
everything looked different
in America as far as blacks

00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:42.067
were concerned."&nbsp;
"After that concert,

00:29:42.067 --> 00:29:44.000
everything looked different
in America as far as blacks

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.600
were concerned."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now
he's not talking literally,

00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:48.600
because the day after
Marian Anderson sang,

00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:49.900
it wasn't like if
you were black,

00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:52.667
you could go into a local
restaurant that's not in the

00:29:52.667 --> 00:29:55.000
black section of town,
or at Union Station,

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:56.767
the only other place
blacks could go for a public

00:29:56.767 --> 00:29:58.500
restaurant.&nbsp; You couldn't go
in someplace else and get a

00:29:58.500 --> 00:30:01.967
meal.&nbsp; You all of a sudden
couldn't get a job that was

00:30:01.967 --> 00:30:05.000
denied to you, you know, the
week before.&nbsp; So in terms of

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:06.400
literal bread
and butter issues,

00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:09.267
there's no change.&nbsp; But
at the level of symbolic

00:30:09.267 --> 00:30:12.500
possibilities, at the
level of what blacks can

00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:17.800
articulate and think
as maybe achievable,

00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:23.800
fundamental change happens
with this concert.&nbsp; Now it's

00:30:26.367 --> 00:30:31.500
also important because the
public outcry surrounding

00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:37.900
Marian Anderson's concert is
happening in the context of

00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:41.567
a larger battle of a war or
rhetoric against the Nazi

00:30:41.567 --> 00:30:45.767
doctrines of racial
supremacy.&nbsp; So you can't

00:30:45.767 --> 00:30:48.767
just understand this concert
in the context of an event

00:30:48.767 --> 00:30:50.267
that happened in
Washington, D.C.,

00:30:50.267 --> 00:30:53.700
or an event that happened in
the U.S.&nbsp; It's an event that

00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:55.900
has global ramifications,
especially for the way in

00:30:55.900 --> 00:30:56.900
which the U.S.

00:30:56.900 --> 00:31:00.567
federal government is
struggling against a war of

00:31:00.567 --> 00:31:06.700
words with Nazi and--Nazi
and fascist regimes.&nbsp; "The

00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:07.700
U.S.

00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:09.400
didn't have a
leg to stand on,

00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:11.900
 the Nazis would say,
"because they're just as

00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:18.900
racist as we are."&nbsp; This is
very important for the U.S.

00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:21.367
as it really does enter
the Second World War and

00:31:21.367 --> 00:31:23.200
continues on
through the Cold War,

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:24.900
something I'll touch
down upon once or twice,

00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:28.000
I'm sure, in this
course.&nbsp; As the U.S.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:29.500
becomes an
international power,

00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:30.700
which is this
part of the story,

00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:34.900
the 1920s and thirties
and forties especially,

00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:37.100
its domestic politics
become scrutinized much more

00:31:37.100 --> 00:31:40.900
closely.&nbsp; World War II,
which we're on the cusp of

00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:42.800
getting involved in, is a
war to stop the spread of

00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:48.200
fascism, but if the U.S.

00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:51.000
can't handle its own
fascistic tendencies

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:57.000
internal, it's a war of
hypocrisy.&nbsp; So you start

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:58.867
seeing there, in
the Scottsboro Boys,

00:31:58.867 --> 00:32:01.400
reaching back to Monday,
and the way they use it as

00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:04.000
cultural markers
for the Communists,

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.167
Marian Anderson being
used as a cultural marker of

00:32:06.167 --> 00:32:09.100
democratic possibilities,
blacks being used as

00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:11.700
cultural markers of
political possibilities,

00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:14.000
of what this country
is supposed to be for

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.600
everybody, and what the
country's supposed to be for

00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:17.700
African Americans, and what
the country's supposed to be

00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:18.900
for the world.&nbsp; Now
this affords--oh,

00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:22.800
one other, this is a
very famous image,

00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:28.600
of course, of Marian
Anderson.&nbsp; There's another

00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:32.567
image that I show up here
just for the sake of a,

00:32:32.567 --> 00:32:36.600
a quick side lesson on how
you read images.&nbsp; There's a

00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:37.800
way in which, you
know, we--we are,

00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:41.500
in our minds' eye, we are
here sitting just below her

00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:46.400
right shoulder, and we see
dignitaries at the micro--at

00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:49.800
the, at the stand.&nbsp; This
image I dug up tells a very

00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:55.200
different story.&nbsp; Except
for--I'll use the mouse

00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:57.000
here--except for
this area here,

00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:58.900
which is cordoned off for
reasons I honestly don't

00:32:58.900 --> 00:33:01.667
know,
everything else you see,

00:33:01.667 --> 00:33:04.000
except for that tree
line, going off to,

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:07.000
beyond the
Reflecting Pool, are people,

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.800
sitting there in an
integrated audience,

00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:13.167
seventy-five thousand
people.&nbsp; It just sort of

00:33:13.167 --> 00:33:15.000
gives you a different sense
of the way this might have

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:19.000
felt if you were actually
there.&nbsp; And because it's

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:20.400
harder to make out
Marian Anderson,

00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:22.200
I'm as--I'm assuming that's
why this is not one of the

00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:23.967
more famous iconic
pictures.&nbsp; You just,

00:33:23.967 --> 00:33:25.900
here's just somebody's
back standing in front of an

00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:31.500
audience.&nbsp; But it really was
quite a visual spectacle,

00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:33.700
and I think offers ways for
you to think about how you

00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:36.767
read images, for instance,
perspective being very

00:33:36.767 --> 00:33:44.700
important.&nbsp; Now I was
talking before the little

00:33:44.700 --> 00:33:45.700
caveat, I was talking about
political symbolism and the

00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:48.700
roles and the ways in
which African Americans were

00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:51.767
political footballs.&nbsp; And
then I wanted to transition

00:33:51.767 --> 00:33:54.900
to a story that helps us
understand how blacks start

00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:56.700
using this to their great
advantage and that's the

00:33:56.700 --> 00:33:57.700
story of A.

00:33:57.700 --> 00:34:00.700
Philip Randolph.&nbsp; A.

00:34:00.700 --> 00:34:03.700
Philip Randolph, whose name
has come up several times

00:34:03.700 --> 00:34:06.600
already in the course, and
I'm going to devote the rest

00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:08.600
of the lecture
to him quickly,

00:34:10.900 --> 00:34:14.067
he is one of the most
important transitional

00:34:14.067 --> 00:34:17.100
political figures in
African American history.

00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:21.300
He was born in 1889,
dies in 1979.&nbsp; I mean,

00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:23.500
the ranges of what happens
in his lifetime is really

00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:26.800
astonishing.&nbsp; But here's a
person who's involved in the

00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:31.700
political scene in the
nineteen-teens and twenties,

00:34:31.700 --> 00:34:36.800
taking a frontline argument
on issues.&nbsp; And he's there

00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:40.000
in 1941 at a moment
of, of powerful symbolic

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:43.767
importance, I'll be talking
about in a moment.&nbsp; And he's

00:34:43.767 --> 00:34:47.100
there in 1963 when King
steps up to the microphone

00:34:47.100 --> 00:34:51.367
and delivers his
"Dream" speech.&nbsp; Incredibly

00:34:51.367 --> 00:34:54.200
important political person.&nbsp;
Helps us navigate from a

00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:56.400
period of Booker T.

00:34:56.400 --> 00:35:01.167
Washington political power,
ideology of accommodation,

00:35:01.167 --> 00:35:04.300
and through his consistent
socialist politics--Randolph

00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:08.500
couldn't stand
Communists but was an ardent

00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:10.967
Socialist--transitions
African American political

00:35:10.967 --> 00:35:15.100
voice to a very different
kind--different kind of

00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:20.200
voice.&nbsp; Now there's three
phases to Randolph's career

00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:25.200
through 1941.&nbsp; In 1914,
he moves to New York City,

00:35:27.367 --> 00:35:29.400
becomes witness, well part
of and witness to the Great

00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:32.367
Migration and sees the
way it transforms that

00:35:32.367 --> 00:35:34.267
particular urban site.

00:35:34.267 --> 00:35:39.700
He sees the NAACP and the
National Urban League as

00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:43.167
people--organizations
fighting out for

00:35:43.167 --> 00:35:45.167
resources--fighting
over resources,

00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:49.100
certainly affecting workers'
lives by their policies,

00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:53.267
but not really at the
workers' level.&nbsp; NAACP being

00:35:53.267 --> 00:35:57.300
very much a
top-down organization,

00:35:57.300 --> 00:36:02.800
with assimilationist and
middle-class norms.&nbsp; The

00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:04.500
National Urban League
trying to help people on the

00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:07.600
ground, but, you
know, in the pocket of

00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:10.700
corporate--corporations and
helping basically break up

00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:12.700
labor unions.&nbsp;
And Randolph says,

00:36:12.700 --> 00:36:17.767
"But what about the workers
themselves?"&nbsp; And so he

00:36:17.767 --> 00:36:20.067
starts looking around
for different ways to get

00:36:20.067 --> 00:36:21.600
involved in
workers' movements,

00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:26.100
labor movements.&nbsp; In
1917, he declares himself a

00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:29.100
Socialist, urges
blacks to resist the U.S.

00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:31.800
draft and to confine their
fighting to the domestic

00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:35.967
front.&nbsp; He can't stand
Du Bois's call to close

00:36:35.967 --> 00:36:39.200
our--close ranks.&nbsp; And
around the same time he,

00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:41.600
along with another black
socialist named Chandler

00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:44.900
Owen, start publishing a
mess--a magazine called the

00:36:44.900 --> 00:36:48.467
Messenger.&nbsp;
Through the Messenger,

00:36:48.467 --> 00:36:52.800
Randolph calls for a bold,
black socialist leadership,

00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:55.300
calls for radicals who would
not be afraid to challenge

00:36:55.300 --> 00:36:57.000
accepted notions
of, of how a U.S.

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:01.167
society should operate.&nbsp; If
Washington is on this part

00:37:01.167 --> 00:37:03.667
of a spectrum, and Du Bois
is over here on the opposite

00:37:03.667 --> 00:37:06.800
side, Randolph's even
further beyond Du Bois

00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:11.700
politically.&nbsp; He and
Owen are characterized as

00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:15.000
Bolsheviks by
members of Congress.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:18.700
They're investigated by
the Department of Justice,

00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:19.967
and they
declare in response,

00:37:19.967 --> 00:37:22.300
"We would be glad to see
a Bolshevik government

00:37:22.300 --> 00:37:24.467
substituted in the South
in place of your Bourbon,

00:37:24.467 --> 00:37:26.400
reactionary, vote-stolen,
misrepresentative,

00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:29.400
democratic
regime."&nbsp; That sounds like,

00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:30.700
you know, Black
Panther talking here,

00:37:30.700 --> 00:37:36.500
doesn't it?&nbsp; In 1919,
Randolph says that he's

00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:37.900
thankful for the
Russian Revolution,

00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:40.900
the greatest achievement of
the twentieth century.&nbsp; But

00:37:40.900 --> 00:37:42.900
when the American
version--when the American

00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:45.800
Communist Party is
organized in twenty-one,

00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:49.300
Randolph remains a Socialist
and dedicates the rest of

00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:50.800
his life really
to preventing

00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:53.600
social--Communists from
controlling or representing

00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:58.067
black America.&nbsp; By
the mid-twenties,

00:37:58.067 --> 00:38:00.267
the Messenger as a journal
is actually not doing that

00:38:00.267 --> 00:38:02.967
well.&nbsp; Randolph still
casting about for ways in

00:38:02.967 --> 00:38:05.467
which to connect
with black workers,

00:38:05.467 --> 00:38:08.500
and a labor union is
being--is organized,

00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:11.467
and recognized that Randolph
really has the voice that

00:38:11.467 --> 00:38:14.800
they need to be heard in
a larger--a larger scene,

00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:16.600
and that's the Brotherhood
of Sleeping Car Porters and

00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:22.600
Maids.&nbsp; In '25, 1925,
Randolph's recruited to head

00:38:24.700 --> 00:38:29.367
the union of
Sleeping Car Porters,

00:38:29.367 --> 00:38:32.200
and then when organized,
trying to get the American

00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:34.100
Federation--the
Pullman Company,

00:38:34.100 --> 00:38:36.667
people who run the
trains, own the trains,

00:38:36.667 --> 00:38:39.767
to recognize that union, and
then the American Federation

00:38:39.767 --> 00:38:44.500
of Labor to recognize that
union.&nbsp; Efforts are made to

00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:47.200
get better working
conditions and higher wages

00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:50.200
from Pullman.&nbsp; Pullman
refuses both and tries

00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:51.367
blackballing
Randolph, tries to,

00:38:51.367 --> 00:38:55.100
you know, crush him.&nbsp;
Randolph becomes very

00:38:55.100 --> 00:38:57.500
unpopular with black and
white groups alike for his

00:38:57.500 --> 00:39:01.900
radical stances, but the
Brotherhood of Sleeping Car

00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:04.400
Porters does earn
the--gather the support of

00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:07.867
the NAACP, the Urban League,
and eventually the American

00:39:07.867 --> 00:39:10.800
Federation of Labor.&nbsp; It
wins partial recognition in

00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:16.667
1926, and in 1929,
more recognition,

00:39:16.667 --> 00:39:22.700
but still not full
recognition.&nbsp; A decade later

00:39:22.700 --> 00:39:27.000
after starting this battle,
Randolph does win for the

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:28.800
Brotherhood of Sleeping
Car Porters and Maids full

00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:30.700
recognition
from the AFL and,

00:39:30.700 --> 00:39:33.900
a year later, from the
Pullman Porters--the Pullman

00:39:33.900 --> 00:39:35.400
porters--I mean
from the AFL,

00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:39.400
ex--from the Pullman
Company.&nbsp; The wages go up,

00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:42.700
job security goes
up, benefits go up.

00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:45.267
The Pullman porters actually
become a great vehicle to

00:39:45.267 --> 00:39:47.600
attain middle-class status
for a segment of black

00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:49.200
America.

00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:51.700
In fact, the
Pullman porters,

00:39:51.700 --> 00:39:52.700
the U.S.

00:39:52.700 --> 00:39:55.500
post, the military, over
the course of the twentieth

00:39:55.500 --> 00:39:58.367
century, are the three great
ways for black Americans to

00:39:58.367 --> 00:40:05.400
transition to middle-class
status.&nbsp; With Randolph's

00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:07.700
victories with the
Brotherhood of Sleeping Car

00:40:07.700 --> 00:40:10.900
Porters and Maids getting
fully recognized finally in

00:40:10.900 --> 00:40:14.400
'36 and '37, he is
seen as, without doubt,

00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:16.700
the most important
black labor leader in the

00:40:16.700 --> 00:40:19.500
country.&nbsp; This is why he's
selected to run the National

00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:23.300
Negro Congress.&nbsp; There's
nobody else who has his

00:40:23.300 --> 00:40:28.400
access, who has his power,
and his influence.&nbsp; But as

00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:33.567
you know, Randolph is a
staunch anti-Communist,

00:40:33.567 --> 00:40:38.967
and as the National Negro
Congress develops further,

00:40:38.967 --> 00:40:41.400
he realizes there's no place
for him any more in that

00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:47.400
organization.&nbsp; So Randolph
starts thinking of a

00:40:50.300 --> 00:40:53.700
different way to
achieve justice for blacks,

00:40:53.700 --> 00:40:56.200
full citizenship rights and
decent jobs for blacks in

00:40:56.200 --> 00:41:00.000
the United States.&nbsp; The
National Negro Congress is

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:01.800
not going to be the
vehicle.&nbsp; What Randolph sees

00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:03.800
is that as the U.S.

00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:07.500
war industry
starts to develop,

00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:11.767
as it's arming
Europe--Western Europe,

00:41:11.767 --> 00:41:15.400
or the Allies, I
should say--as the U.S.

00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:18.900
war machine, industrial
war machine develops,

00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:21.000
these are the best
paying jobs in the country,

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:23.300
as far as, you know,
factory work is concerned,

00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:26.800
and blacks can't get those
jobs.&nbsp; They can work--they

00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:28.000
can push a broom
in the factory,

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:30.700
but they can't roll steel,
or whatever you do in a

00:41:30.700 --> 00:41:36.600
munitions factory.&nbsp;
Factories run overtime.&nbsp;

00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:38.967
There's money to be made
hand over fist.&nbsp; Blacks

00:41:38.967 --> 00:41:42.200
couldn't get those jobs.&nbsp;
There's movements being made

00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:44.100
to increase the
size of the army,

00:41:44.100 --> 00:41:47.000
a powerfully segregated
army.&nbsp; Randolph says,

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:48.800
"Where do we fit
in, in all of this?

00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:51.400
We're second-class in
the factory and in the

00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:59.167
military."&nbsp; Randolph and a
group of other leaders go to

00:41:59.167 --> 00:42:01.700
Franklin Roosevelt,
September of 1940,

00:42:01.700 --> 00:42:04.800
with a seven
point plan, that,

00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:06.600
I mean, I'm not going to go
into now in the interests of

00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:08.300
time, but
essentially calling for the

00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:10.400
desegregation or the
integration of the U.S.

00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:18.000
military, calling for access
to all jobs in the defense

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:20.500
industries, essentially
anti-discrimination

00:42:20.500 --> 00:42:23.900
policies.&nbsp; The plea
is ignored.&nbsp; FDR,

00:42:23.900 --> 00:42:26.000
always being afraid of
losing his coalition of

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:29.100
southern Democrats who would
be upset by any sort of

00:42:29.100 --> 00:42:36.900
racial progressive
politics.&nbsp; Blacks are going

00:42:36.900 --> 00:42:38.900
into the army certainly, but
they're going into all black

00:42:38.900 --> 00:42:41.200
units, trained in
separate places,

00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:44.100
trained most often by white
officers.&nbsp; A lot of the same

00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:46.367
story that you heard in
World War I.&nbsp; Domestic

00:42:46.367 --> 00:42:50.867
hiring situation is a joke.&nbsp;
Blacks are not being hired

00:42:50.867 --> 00:42:54.367
in factory floor jobs.&nbsp; As
white men go off to fight in

00:42:54.367 --> 00:42:56.400
the war, white women are
brought into the factory,

00:42:56.400 --> 00:42:58.500
a radical change for
women's possibilities,

00:42:58.500 --> 00:43:01.600
certainly, but black men and
black women are not getting

00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:05.867
these jobs.&nbsp; So in
January of 1941,

00:43:05.867 --> 00:43:07.600
Randolph proposes--I mean
he's no longer with the

00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:09.400
National Negro Congress.&nbsp;
He's broken from them.&nbsp; He

00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:12.700
proposes a March
on Washington,

00:43:12.700 --> 00:43:16.967
and he demands that
something be done regarding

00:43:16.967 --> 00:43:21.900
black access to jobs, and of
course for the integration

00:43:21.900 --> 00:43:26.200
of the military.&nbsp; And he
calls at first for ten

00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:30.000
thousand blacks to march on
Washington.&nbsp; And as that met

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:33.200
with enthusiasm, he calls
for fifty thousand.&nbsp; Then he

00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:36.400
calls for one hundred
thousand blacks to march on

00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:37.767
Washington that
summer, on July 1st,

00:43:37.767 --> 00:43:44.100
if there is no change.&nbsp; It
doesn't seem like bluster.&nbsp;

00:43:44.100 --> 00:43:50.467
Things have changed, on the
ground and in the air.&nbsp; As

00:43:50.467 --> 00:43:52.567
we head into the
summer, into June,

00:43:52.567 --> 00:43:54.000
people in D.C.

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:56.300
are getting
concerned.&nbsp; "My god,

00:43:56.300 --> 00:44:01.067
what if one hundred thousand
Negroes come into this city

00:44:01.067 --> 00:44:05.800
and are angry?&nbsp; What
are we going to do?"&nbsp; And

00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:07.200
Roosevelt,
Franklin Roosevelt,

00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:11.300
dispatches two of his
most trusted sort of network

00:44:11.300 --> 00:44:14.600
political
operatives to talk with A.

00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:17.500
Philip Randolph to calm him
down.&nbsp; He sends Fiorello La

00:44:17.500 --> 00:44:20.600
Guardia, then the
mayor of New York City,

00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:22.900
liberal on race issues.&nbsp;
"Please talk to Randolph and

00:44:22.900 --> 00:44:25.400
tell him to call off this
march."&nbsp; No dice.&nbsp; He sends

00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:29.500
his wife, the most powerful
proponent on these issues in

00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:32.100
his pocket, he sends
his wife.&nbsp; Randolph goes,

00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:34.667
"No dice.&nbsp; I'm not, I'm
not canceling this march."&nbsp;

00:44:40.767 --> 00:44:45.667
Finally FDR says,
"Okay, Mr. Randolph,

00:44:45.667 --> 00:44:48.800
come to see me."&nbsp;It's a week
before the march is set to

00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:53.500
go off.&nbsp; Randolph goes
into the White House,

00:44:53.500 --> 00:44:56.100
meets with Roosevelt.&nbsp;
And Roosevelt says,

00:44:56.100 --> 00:44:58.667
Roosevelt says, "If
you call off the march,

00:44:58.667 --> 00:45:01.000
I'll issue an executive
order with 'teeth' in it,

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:05.467
 as the word was.&nbsp;
And Randolph says,

00:45:05.467 --> 00:45:11.467
"Okay."&nbsp; Roosevelt signs
Executive Order 8802 on June

00:45:15.267 --> 00:45:19.400
25th, 1941.&nbsp; It says there
shall be no discrimination

00:45:19.400 --> 00:45:21.600
in the employment of workers
in defense industries or

00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:22.867
government
because of race, creed,

00:45:22.867 --> 00:45:26.067
color or national origin,
and it's the duty of the

00:45:26.067 --> 00:45:28.400
employers and of labor
organizations to provide for

00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:30.500
the full and equitable
participation of all workers

00:45:30.500 --> 00:45:33.000
in defense industries
without discrimination based

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:39.000
on race, creed, color,
national origin.&nbsp; It sets up

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:41.967
a Fair Employment Practices
Committee that would be a

00:45:41.967 --> 00:45:46.900
watchdog organization.&nbsp; It
couldn't do anything but

00:45:46.900 --> 00:45:50.500
give bad publicity to a
factory that's not hiring

00:45:50.500 --> 00:45:52.767
black workers.&nbsp; But
people didn't want to be,

00:45:52.767 --> 00:45:55.867
to be seen
somehow as un-American,

00:45:55.867 --> 00:45:58.867
so FE--FEPC could make some
changes along the margins,

00:45:58.867 --> 00:46:01.700
along the edges of things.

00:46:01.700 --> 00:46:04.600
You'll notice that the
executive order did not end

00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:06.500
segregation in the military.

00:46:06.500 --> 00:46:11.367
It's simply calling for
industry changes.&nbsp; Randolph

00:46:11.367 --> 00:46:13.700
doesn't win that battle and
won't win it for a while.&nbsp;

00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:22.300
Now blacks hail the
Executive Order 8802 as the

00:46:22.300 --> 00:46:24.200
most significant order
since the Emancipation

00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:27.300
Proclamation.&nbsp;
This is a new era,

00:46:27.300 --> 00:46:30.000
and it's not a new era
just because of what the

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:32.567
President's calling
for.&nbsp; It's on the ground,

00:46:32.567 --> 00:46:35.767
what happens is a little, a
little messier.&nbsp; It doesn't

00:46:35.767 --> 00:46:38.700
immediately integrate all
industries.&nbsp; But what's

00:46:38.700 --> 00:46:41.500
really important
is the linkage now,

00:46:41.500 --> 00:46:46.700
the symbolic possibilities
and real political change,

00:46:46.700 --> 00:46:50.300
and that is a prominent
leader of the African

00:46:50.300 --> 00:46:55.300
American community called
the President's bluff;

00:46:55.300 --> 00:46:58.100
was called into the White
House and they negotiated,

00:46:58.100 --> 00:47:03.267
face to face, to find a
resolution.&nbsp; That's one of

00:47:03.267 --> 00:47:04.800
the things, once the
genie's out of that bottle,

00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:08.067
it can't go back in.&nbsp; So
black access to the White

00:47:08.067 --> 00:47:12.200
House is now direct, to the
President.&nbsp; Presidents from

00:47:12.200 --> 00:47:17.000
this point on cannot afford
to ignore black leaders in

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:20.267
the way they have been doing
since the founding of the

00:47:20.267 --> 00:47:24.367
Republic.&nbsp; So you have in
A.&nbsp; Philip Randolph and the

00:47:24.367 --> 00:47:29.267
March on Washington moment
the merging of the symbolic

00:47:29.267 --> 00:47:31.867
politics of possibility
and the real politics of

00:47:31.867 --> 00:47:35.700
possibility.&nbsp; And it is a
merger that would go on to

00:47:35.700 --> 00:47:38.400
define the civil rights
movement that we know about

00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:41.800
so well over the next thirty
or forty years.&nbsp; Thank you

00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:43.800
very much.

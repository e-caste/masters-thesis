Professor Mark
Saltzman:

00:00:14.518 --> 00:00:17.324
Okay, this week we're going to
continue in our discussion about

00:00:17.324 --> 00:00:19.841
the immune system.
But talk about sort of

00:00:19.841 --> 00:00:23.712
engineering the immune system,
how to produce immunity in

00:00:23.712 --> 00:00:26.820
individuals.
And we're going to do that by

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.605
talking about some examples,
some historical examples,

00:00:30.605 --> 00:00:34.390
in the sort of technology and
vaccine development.

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.739
And what I hope to do over
the course of this lecture and

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:44.643
the lecture on Thursday,
is complete what's described on

00:00:44.643 --> 00:00:49.152
this outline slide here.
First, using a couple of

00:00:49.152 --> 00:00:53.345
examples that have turned out to
be very important,

00:00:53.345 --> 00:00:58.376
one is the example of smallpox,
and the second is the example

00:00:58.376 --> 00:01:02.384
of polio.
Talk about how vaccines were

00:01:02.384 --> 00:01:07.648
developed in these particular
situations, and how the

00:01:07.648 --> 00:01:13.419
development of the biology is
coupled with delivering this

00:01:13.419 --> 00:01:17.801
through populations,
and how these sort of

00:01:17.801 --> 00:01:22.130
intricately woven together.
It's not enough to understand

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.722
the biology of how to create a
vaccine, if you can't make

00:01:25.722 --> 00:01:29.700
enough of the vaccine or deliver
it to people in ways that it's

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.570
useful.
And so we'll talk about how

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:37.550
that happened in the--using the
examples of smallpox and polio.

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.148
And that will bring us to a
general discussion of sort of

00:01:41.148 --> 00:01:44.940
the tools that are available now
for vaccine development,

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.750
which we'll talk about on
Thursday.

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.110
I don't have to say too
much about why vaccines are

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.886
important.
You know about this,

00:01:56.886 --> 00:02:00.409
and this is a slide that I
showed you.

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:04.175
The graph is something I showed
you on the first day of class,

00:02:04.175 --> 00:02:07.200
that over the last hundred
years in particular,

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.990
but what's shown on this slide
is over the last 300 years.

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:15.560
Life expectancy for humans has
increased dramatically.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.609
And one of the reasons that's
most responsible for that is

00:02:19.609 --> 00:02:23.730
that humans aren't dying at as
young an age from infectious

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.780
diseases as they did three or
four hundred years ago.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:33.248
And there are many reasons for
this, our success in eliminating

00:02:33.248 --> 00:02:38.099
infectious diseases as causes in
the developed world.

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:39.800
And you know what those reasons
are.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.865
One is that doctors started
washing their hands in between

00:02:42.865 --> 00:02:46.050
when they saw patients.
That had a remarkable effect on

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.663
reducing transmission of
infectious diseases,

00:02:48.663 --> 00:02:50.860
in doctor's offices and
hospitals.

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:57.167
Another is that we learned a
lot of things about engineering

00:02:57.167 --> 00:03:01.550
of public systems,
like water supplies.

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:04.852
Separating our water supply
from sewage and learning how to

00:03:04.852 --> 00:03:07.870
do wastewater treatment was a
really important part of

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.799
reducing infectious diseases.
But vaccines,

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:14.188
and particularly in the last
hundred years,

00:03:14.188 --> 00:03:18.950
vaccines have been one of the
most important elements in our

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.686
progress.
And so what this slide just

00:03:22.686 --> 00:03:27.030
reminds you of how much progress
we've made.

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.246
Also, shows you something about
the challenge of it,

00:03:30.246 --> 00:03:33.904
because we are susceptible to
attack from lots of different

00:03:33.904 --> 00:03:37.728
kinds of microorganisms.
So, not just a spectrum of

00:03:37.728 --> 00:03:42.794
viruses, but there's viruses and
bacteria and parasites and other

00:03:42.794 --> 00:03:46.039
microorganisms that can cause
disease.

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:50.387
And so this slide just
illustrates that in a simple

00:03:50.387 --> 00:03:55.169
way, the range of different
kinds of organisms that your

00:03:55.169 --> 00:03:58.560
immune system is trying
to--whoops!

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.612
[laughs]
Wait a minute,

00:04:01.612 --> 00:04:08.409
I've lost control of--I'm
not--Oh, there it is.

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:10.289
It's not showing up on the
screen for some reason.

00:04:10.289 --> 00:04:15.134
That, this shows the range of
morphologies of microorganisms

00:04:15.134 --> 00:04:19.649
that your immune system has to
potentially encounter,

00:04:19.649 --> 00:04:23.585
from complex organisms like the
syphilis pathogen here,

00:04:23.585 --> 00:04:26.939
a virus, this is a
false-colored image of a virus,

00:04:26.939 --> 00:04:29.189
very tiny, not shown to scale
here;

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:32.585
and bacteria like
salmonella and

00:04:32.585 --> 00:04:36.464
staphylococcus.
So these organisms like this

00:04:36.464 --> 00:04:39.932
are abundant in the world around
us and our immune system

00:04:39.932 --> 00:04:43.030
prevents us from getting sick
most of the time.

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.945
So what is a vaccine?
A vaccine is a prepared,

00:04:46.945 --> 00:04:50.589
it's a preparation,
that's prepared in some way.

00:04:50.589 --> 00:04:53.142
We're going to talk about how
they're prepared,

00:04:53.142 --> 00:04:56.250
but it's a preparation that is
intended to stimulate your

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.997
immune system.
So, what that really means,

00:04:58.997 --> 00:05:02.492
you know, from last week's
lecture, is that the vaccine

00:05:02.492 --> 00:05:06.181
stimulates these particular
cells in your immune system to

00:05:06.181 --> 00:05:10.290
give you immunity.
We're usually talking about

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:14.370
adaptive immunity here.
So, either stimulates the

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:17.519
production of--and
differentiation of B-cells,

00:05:17.519 --> 00:05:22.000
to produce a specific antibody
that can neutralize the virus,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.798
or stimulates the production of
cytotoxic T-cells that can kill

00:05:26.798 --> 00:05:30.935
infected cells within your body.
But in any event,

00:05:30.935 --> 00:05:35.896
the vaccine is intended to
stimulate the immune system to

00:05:35.896 --> 00:05:40.237
produce an effector
response--either antibodies or

00:05:40.237 --> 00:05:45.375
specific cells--that can combat
spread of the microorganism

00:05:45.375 --> 00:05:50.341
through your body.
Usually it's done by taking

00:05:50.341 --> 00:05:55.666
all or part of the infectious
agent, and showing them to your

00:05:55.666 --> 00:06:00.287
immune system in some way.
And so we talked very briefly

00:06:00.287 --> 00:06:04.170
last time about this business of
antigen presentation,

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:08.134
how your immune system--one of
the things that it does

00:06:08.134 --> 00:06:11.650
especially well,
is recognize what's part of you

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:15.769
and what's not part of you.
It can separate between what's

00:06:15.769 --> 00:06:19.069
part of yourself and what's
foreign, and it does that by

00:06:19.069 --> 00:06:21.678
presenting,
by recognizing antigens that

00:06:21.678 --> 00:06:25.405
are presented in the context of
the major histocompatibility

00:06:25.405 --> 00:06:27.779
complex,
MHC.

00:06:27.779 --> 00:06:33.490
So a vaccine is designed in
order to engage that biology,

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:39.200
in order to provide antigens
that will stimulate specifically

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:44.238
your immune system.
Usually it involves pieces of

00:06:44.238 --> 00:06:49.639
the infectious agent itself,
to cause that engagement.

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:52.934
So, that's what a vaccine is,
and vaccination is the process

00:06:52.934 --> 00:06:56.118
of taking that vaccine that
you've developed and giving it

00:06:56.118 --> 00:06:58.908
to people,
either individual people or

00:06:58.908 --> 00:07:02.480
groups of people,
or as we'll talk about today,

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:06.439
people all over the world.
And so that's a very different

00:07:06.439 --> 00:07:08.792
thing, right?
Designing something that works

00:07:08.792 --> 00:07:11.857
in a particular individual,
and designing something that

00:07:11.857 --> 00:07:14.310
can be used in people all over
the world,

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:18.019
involve different sorts of
accomplishments.

00:07:18.019 --> 00:07:23.420
Well, we've all had some
experience with vaccines.

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:26.885
You can't go to school in this
country, and in many countries,

00:07:26.885 --> 00:07:30.009
until you've had your
prescribed set of vaccinations.

00:07:30.009 --> 00:07:33.283
And so they're already very
safe, very effective vaccines

00:07:33.283 --> 00:07:35.680
available for many infectious
diseases.

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:39.399
There's a partial list that's
shown here, starting the top of

00:07:39.399 --> 00:07:41.991
the list with smallpox,
and that's what we're going to

00:07:41.991 --> 00:07:43.519
spend most of the time talking
about today.

00:07:43.519 --> 00:07:46.337
There are vaccines for rabies,
for typhoid,

00:07:46.337 --> 00:07:48.324
diphtheria.
Most recently,

00:07:48.324 --> 00:07:51.510
or more recently,
there was a vaccine for

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:56.288
varicella, which you know is
chickenpox that was developed in

00:07:56.288 --> 00:08:00.027
the last ten years.
Now, so there's probably a

00:08:00.027 --> 00:08:03.256
number of people in this room,
so when I first started

00:08:03.256 --> 00:08:05.449
teaching this class 20 years
ago,

00:08:05.449 --> 00:08:09.069
everybody in the room had had
chickenpox.

00:08:09.069 --> 00:08:11.001
Right, now are there people
here that have not had

00:08:11.001 --> 00:08:14.365
chickenpox, right?
Because you had the vaccine,

00:08:14.365 --> 00:08:18.689
presumably, and so you didn't
get the disease.

00:08:18.689 --> 00:08:24.062
And so this is a substantial
change in the interaction of a

00:08:24.062 --> 00:08:27.860
microorganism with a population,
right?

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:30.233
A lot of didn't get sick from
it now, and we got sick from it

00:08:30.233 --> 00:08:32.203
before.
You also know that there's some

00:08:32.203 --> 00:08:35.118
vaccines that are not yet
available, for diseases that we

00:08:35.118 --> 00:08:39.411
would very much like to prevent.
HIV infection and AIDS is the

00:08:39.411 --> 00:08:44.183
one that comes first to mind,
and is responsible for this

00:08:44.183 --> 00:08:48.498
slide,
I think this is data from a few

00:08:48.498 --> 00:08:52.620
years ago, 700,000 deaths per
year.

00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:55.269
That number is undoubtedly
higher than now.

00:08:55.269 --> 00:08:58.661
AIDS is a tremendous problem,
deaths from HIV infection and

00:08:58.661 --> 00:09:01.995
AIDS a tremendous problem in
Africa and other parts of the

00:09:01.995 --> 00:09:03.838
world.
But there are other

00:09:03.838 --> 00:09:06.629
diseases that are numerically
even more important.

00:09:06.629 --> 00:09:11.456
The whole category of diarrheal
diseases, caused by viruses

00:09:11.456 --> 00:09:16.034
called enteroviruses,
where they, it infects your

00:09:16.034 --> 00:09:18.458
gut.
Your gut's unable to function

00:09:18.458 --> 00:09:21.549
in the normal way,
and so you get severe diarrhea.

00:09:21.549 --> 00:09:25.685
You can become dehydrated and
die just as a result of the loss

00:09:25.685 --> 00:09:28.736
of water there,
because of your body's natural

00:09:28.736 --> 00:09:32.441
response to the infection.
And that causes five to ten

00:09:32.441 --> 00:09:36.207
million deaths per year.
And children are particularly

00:09:36.207 --> 00:09:39.809
susceptible to these.
Children get diseases from a

00:09:39.809 --> 00:09:42.688
class of viruses called
rotaviruses,

00:09:42.688 --> 00:09:46.664
for which we have no vaccine,
and- and so no way to protect

00:09:46.664 --> 00:09:50.005
them.
Malaria causes a million deaths

00:09:50.005 --> 00:09:55.058
per year, and schistosomiasis,
which is a parasitic disease,

00:09:55.058 --> 00:09:59.940
is unfortunately a common cause
of death in the world.

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:04.141
And so these are situations
where we would very much like to

00:10:04.141 --> 00:10:06.475
produce a vaccine,
but we can't yet,

00:10:06.475 --> 00:10:09.897
and the question is 'Why?
Why is it difficult in some

00:10:09.897 --> 00:10:13.369
cases to produce a vaccine when
we've been successful in so many

00:10:13.369 --> 00:10:16.092
others?
And so one of the points I want

00:10:16.092 --> 00:10:17.985
to make here,
on this slide,

00:10:17.985 --> 00:10:21.419
is that this is a very
disease-specific thing.

00:10:21.419 --> 00:10:24.567
Learning how to turn on your
immune system to protect you

00:10:24.567 --> 00:10:27.828
from a specific pathogen turns
out to be very particular to

00:10:27.828 --> 00:10:30.046
that pathogen.
That shouldn't be too

00:10:30.046 --> 00:10:32.748
surprising given what we talked
about last week,

00:10:32.748 --> 00:10:36.370
that your immune system,
the adaptive immune system in

00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:40.440
particular, responds to
individual antigens differently.

00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:48.147
Just to think about what's
most important in the U.S.,

00:10:48.147 --> 00:10:52.250
of the top five reported
infections in the U.S.,

00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:55.037
and this is again from a few
years ago, but I'm fairly sure

00:10:55.037 --> 00:10:56.720
that the numbers haven't
changed,

00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:59.183
three of the top five
infectious diseases,

00:10:59.183 --> 00:11:03.029
or the infectious diseases most
commonly reported in the U.S.,

00:11:03.029 --> 00:11:05.878
are sexually transmitted
diseases: Chlamydia,

00:11:05.878 --> 00:11:09.481
gonorrhea and HIV infection.
None of these do we have

00:11:09.481 --> 00:11:12.043
vaccines for,
and it's turned out that

00:11:12.043 --> 00:11:16.059
sexually transmitted diseases
for a variety of reasons,

00:11:16.059 --> 00:11:20.260
we'll come back to later,
are particularly difficult to

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:24.187
develop vaccines for.
We'll talk about why that's

00:11:24.187 --> 00:11:28.881
been the case as we go through.
And this just is another

00:11:28.881 --> 00:11:32.894
list, I mainly wanted you to
have it in your notes of

00:11:32.894 --> 00:11:36.600
diseases that are important
around the world,

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:40.254
for which there are very active
programs to develop either

00:11:40.254 --> 00:11:42.690
vaccines or more effective
vaccines.

00:11:42.690 --> 00:11:45.773
You know that there is a
vaccine for hepatitis B,

00:11:45.773 --> 00:11:48.149
for example,
which is on this list.

00:11:48.149 --> 00:11:51.692
And you've all been vaccinated,
I would guess,

00:11:51.692 --> 00:11:54.735
for hepatitis B.
It's the one where you have to

00:11:54.735 --> 00:11:58.094
get three shots over a period of
six months, and so you have to

00:11:58.094 --> 00:12:00.718
remember to go back,
you get a first ba--you get a

00:12:00.718 --> 00:12:03.761
first shot, you have to remember
to go back after a month and get

00:12:03.761 --> 00:12:05.845
a second shot,
you have to go back after six

00:12:05.845 --> 00:12:08.772
months and get a third shot.
Then they test you to make sure

00:12:08.772 --> 00:12:11.650
that you have adequate
protection, and some people need

00:12:11.650 --> 00:12:14.746
an additional shot after that.
And so that's an effective

00:12:14.746 --> 00:12:16.856
vaccines.
But it's only an effective

00:12:16.856 --> 00:12:20.603
vaccine in the context where you
have people who can go to the

00:12:20.603 --> 00:12:23.749
doctor's office,
or to an urgent care,

00:12:23.749 --> 00:12:27.708
some kind of medical facility,
three times,

00:12:27.708 --> 00:12:30.669
reliably,
at a specified period of time.

00:12:30.669 --> 00:12:33.829
And that's not possible in all
parts of the world,

00:12:33.829 --> 00:12:37.054
not everybody has that
opportunity to interact with

00:12:37.054 --> 00:12:39.440
medical professionals that
often.

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:43.303
And so there's a lot of
interest, not just in developing

00:12:43.303 --> 00:12:46.970
vaccines for diseases that we
don't have vaccines for,

00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:51.470
but for delivering vaccines
that are more effective.

00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:53.269
For example,
what if you could make a

00:12:53.269 --> 00:12:56.220
hepatitis vaccine that was good
in one shot instead of three

00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:58.439
shots?
Or vaccines that could be

00:12:58.439 --> 00:13:02.567
transported more easily--the
hepatitis vaccine that we get is

00:13:02.567 --> 00:13:05.250
not stable unless it's
refrigerated.

00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:07.504
It's in solution,
it's refrigerated,

00:13:07.504 --> 00:13:11.176
and it's very difficult to
transport refrigerated vaccines

00:13:11.176 --> 00:13:14.977
to all the remote parts of the
world where you would like to

00:13:14.977 --> 00:13:17.932
transport them.
And so that very practical

00:13:17.932 --> 00:13:21.692
consideration turns out to be
important in how we use vaccines

00:13:21.692 --> 00:13:24.450
in real populations.
So if you could make a

00:13:24.450 --> 00:13:28.106
hepatitis B vaccine that didn't
require a shot or that didn't

00:13:28.106 --> 00:13:31.176
require refrigeration,
that would be a tremendous

00:13:31.176 --> 00:13:34.330
advance in spreading that
vaccine through the world.

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:37.220
So, that's another example of
the difference between a vaccine

00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:39.590
that works, and a vaccination
that works, right?

00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:42.484
A vaccine might work if the
person is there and you can

00:13:42.484 --> 00:13:44.547
interact with them.
A vaccination,

00:13:44.547 --> 00:13:48.162
for it to work around the
world, has to be inexpensive,

00:13:48.162 --> 00:13:51.794
transportable,
possible to use without

00:13:51.794 --> 00:13:57.759
advanced medical personnel,
and those kinds of things.

00:13:57.759 --> 00:14:01.244
Okay, so let's talk about
the example of smallpox,

00:14:01.244 --> 00:14:04.926
which is one of the world's
great successes in the battle

00:14:04.926 --> 00:14:08.909
against infectious diseases.
Just to say a little bit about

00:14:08.909 --> 00:14:12.418
smallpox, because unlike
chickenpox, which if you haven't

00:14:12.418 --> 00:14:15.049
had, you've probably seen a case
of it.

00:14:15.049 --> 00:14:19.520
None of us have seen a case of
smallpox, it hasn't existed in

00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:23.424
the world for many decades now.
But smallpox was,

00:14:23.424 --> 00:14:26.740
at one time,
one of the most frightening

00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:30.208
diseases on the planet.
It's a devastating,

00:14:30.208 --> 00:14:32.659
frequently fatal infectious
disease.

00:14:32.659 --> 00:14:36.282
If smallpox occurred in your
community, about 30 percent of

00:14:36.282 --> 00:14:39.779
the people that acquire the
disease would die from it;

00:14:39.779 --> 00:14:42.764
the other 70 percent could be
disabled or permanently

00:14:42.764 --> 00:14:45.060
disfigured as a result of the
disease.

00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:48.771
It's an infectious disease;
it is spread by--through the

00:14:48.771 --> 00:14:51.230
air.
So, it first infects you

00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:55.169
because you breathe in some of
the infectious agent.

00:14:55.169 --> 00:14:57.685
Smallpox is a virus called
variola,

00:14:57.685 --> 00:15:00.940
it's a virus that contains DNA.
The name of the virus is

00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:03.263
variola.
It's part of a family of

00:15:03.263 --> 00:15:07.146
viruses, and we'll talk about at
least one other member of that

00:15:07.146 --> 00:15:09.840
family of viruses as we go
through here.

00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:14.015
But it can be acquired in the
air, from patients that are

00:15:14.015 --> 00:15:17.669
from- from other individuals
that are infected.

00:15:17.669 --> 00:15:20.191
You breathe it in,
it infects the cells of your

00:15:20.191 --> 00:15:22.439
respiratory tract,
and the virus begins to

00:15:22.439 --> 00:15:25.509
reproduce, and then it spreads
throughout your body.

00:15:25.509 --> 00:15:29.178
And so during the first period
after you come in contact with

00:15:29.178 --> 00:15:32.541
the disease, you have an
incubation period where you get

00:15:32.541 --> 00:15:36.088
sort of the kind of symptoms
that we associate with lots of

00:15:36.088 --> 00:15:39.329
kinds of viral infections that
we contract through our

00:15:39.329 --> 00:15:42.970
respiratory system;
you might have a fever;

00:15:42.970 --> 00:15:46.022
a malaise, which is just that
feeling that you don't want to

00:15:46.022 --> 00:15:49.999
get out of bed and go to class.
You might have that commonly,

00:15:49.999 --> 00:15:52.660
but even more severe than
normal;

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:55.440
aches;
and a rash.

00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:57.632
And this is what's
characteristic of smallpox,

00:15:57.632 --> 00:16:00.019
is that as the virus spreads
through your body,

00:16:00.019 --> 00:16:03.072
it particularly,
it particularly affects cells

00:16:03.072 --> 00:16:05.799
of your skin.
So, you get a rash,

00:16:05.799 --> 00:16:09.673
or a redness of the skin.
And then you would recover

00:16:09.673 --> 00:16:12.843
for a while, that initial phase
of the illness would disappear,

00:16:12.843 --> 00:16:15.860
your fever might go down,
you might appear to be normal.

00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:19.277
Then you start to get lesions
on your skin that are very

00:16:19.277 --> 00:16:22.814
characteristic of smallpox.
They start as what are called

00:16:22.814 --> 00:16:24.907
vesicular lesions,
or like blisters,

00:16:24.907 --> 00:16:27.120
where they're filled with a
fluid.

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:32.836
They evolve to become very
dense, hard, pustular lesions,

00:16:32.836 --> 00:16:38.860
which are filled with what
turns out to be tissue debris.

00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:42.530
It's really just the result of
the virus dividing within cells

00:16:42.530 --> 00:16:44.938
of your skin,
and producing a lot of dead

00:16:44.938 --> 00:16:47.747
cells.
And so that debris fills up a

00:16:47.747 --> 00:16:51.629
little spot that would feel,
according to reports,

00:16:51.629 --> 00:16:55.099
because again we don't see it
now, feels like a little pellet

00:16:55.099 --> 00:16:58.548
underneath your skin.
And this fluid eventually

00:16:58.548 --> 00:17:02.530
starts to leak out and those
lesions would heal,

00:17:02.530 --> 00:17:05.750
but they leave scars in most
cases.

00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:08.822
These are very deep lesions
that go not just on the surface

00:17:08.822 --> 00:17:10.730
of your skin like a blister
would,

00:17:10.730 --> 00:17:13.362
but down into the dermis or
deeper layers of the skins,

00:17:13.362 --> 00:17:15.605
as well.
In fact, certain areas of the

00:17:15.605 --> 00:17:18.509
skin would be impacted most,
most dramatically,

00:17:18.509 --> 00:17:23.066
the face and the chest,
the arms, but more distal point

00:17:23.066 --> 00:17:26.779
of the arms, like the palms of
your hands.

00:17:26.779 --> 00:17:31.742
And so you can imagine that
even in its--with all of this

00:17:31.742 --> 00:17:36.125
activity on your skin,
even at its most--least serious

00:17:36.125 --> 00:17:40.199
level, it's a terrible disease.
I'll show you a picture in just

00:17:40.199 --> 00:17:42.214
a moment.
But in some cases,

00:17:42.214 --> 00:17:47.027
that progressions of the
disease would start to affect

00:17:47.027 --> 00:17:50.341
other organs,
in addition to your skin,

00:17:50.341 --> 00:17:54.511
and your body would become
overwhelmed with the infection

00:17:54.511 --> 00:17:57.632
and eventually die.
And as I mentioned before,

00:17:57.632 --> 00:18:00.767
death would occur in 20-30
percent of the cases that got

00:18:00.767 --> 00:18:02.819
the most severe form of
smallpox.

00:18:02.819 --> 00:18:06.560
And so, if this was a disease
that entered your community,

00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:09.710
you could have expected several
centuries ago.

00:18:09.710 --> 00:18:13.888
At the end of this sweep of the
disease through your community,

00:18:13.888 --> 00:18:15.707
one in four,
or one in five,

00:18:15.707 --> 00:18:19.009
of your neighbors would die
from the disease.

00:18:19.009 --> 00:18:21.730
And that says,
that's a dramatic effect on

00:18:21.730 --> 00:18:25.140
communities.
Well, smallpox affected

00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:29.182
world history,
it's--just as HIV infection is

00:18:29.182 --> 00:18:33.853
affecting world history now.
Smallpox affected world history

00:18:33.853 --> 00:18:36.853
hundreds of years ago,
and it was a disease that was

00:18:36.853 --> 00:18:40.009
common in Europe,
but not common in the Americas

00:18:40.009 --> 00:18:42.319
until the Americas were
colonized.

00:18:42.319 --> 00:18:46.030
And so there are famous reports
of how the Aztecs,

00:18:46.030 --> 00:18:50.119
that whole civilization,
was devastated by smallpox.

00:18:50.119 --> 00:18:53.543
That disease was brought to
them by the Spanish when they

00:18:53.543 --> 00:18:56.599
came to these continents in the
16^(th) Century.

00:18:56.599 --> 00:19:00.380
And the Spanish,
a much smaller group of people

00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:04.160
was able to overtake the Aztec
civilization,

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:07.672
very well established,
because that group of people

00:19:07.672 --> 00:19:12.765
was devastated by the disease.
And they were weakened as a

00:19:12.765 --> 00:19:18.140
result, and so the Spaniards,
even in fewer numbers,

00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:22.803
were able to conquer.
So these are just some

00:19:22.803 --> 00:19:27.562
pictures to show you what the
smallpox lesions look like on

00:19:27.562 --> 00:19:31.698
the face of a child,
and then distributed over the

00:19:31.698 --> 00:19:35.886
whole body of an adult,
to give you some better idea of

00:19:35.886 --> 00:19:42.079
what kind of a disease this was.
So, the process of developing a

00:19:42.079 --> 00:19:47.130
vaccine occurred over a long
period of time.

00:19:47.130 --> 00:19:51.973
In fact, there's evidence that
even thousands of years ago,

00:19:51.973 --> 00:19:57.066
Indian and Chinese healers were
using a form of something that

00:19:57.066 --> 00:20:00.240
we would recognize as
vaccination.

00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:03.885
And they did this by
taking--they recognized that

00:20:03.885 --> 00:20:07.910
somehow, if you had a mild
exposure to the disease,

00:20:07.910 --> 00:20:12.485
your body could then develop
protection against more severe

00:20:12.485 --> 00:20:15.939
forms of the disease.
And so, the older way,

00:20:15.939 --> 00:20:19.440
the more ancient way of
exposing you to disease,

00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:23.941
was in the case of smallpox,
to take pieces of tissue from

00:20:23.941 --> 00:20:28.173
somebody that was infected,
and usually it was one of the

00:20:28.173 --> 00:20:32.329
scabs that formed as a result of
these skin lesions,

00:20:32.329 --> 00:20:35.322
and to grind up that scab
somehow and expose it to

00:20:35.322 --> 00:20:38.619
somebody who you wanted to
protect from the disease.

00:20:38.619 --> 00:20:42.875
And the way that India
healers did this was by putting

00:20:42.875 --> 00:20:46.907
pieces of this in your nose,
or injecting it under your

00:20:46.907 --> 00:20:51.212
skin.
And there was a feeling that

00:20:51.212 --> 00:20:56.920
this could protect you against
the disease.

00:20:56.920 --> 00:21:03.637
And it turns out that there is.
We now know what the scientific

00:21:03.637 --> 00:21:05.858
basis of that is,
it involves activation of our

00:21:05.858 --> 00:21:08.886
immune system.
And it was a practice that was

00:21:08.886 --> 00:21:13.519
not broadly used until somebody
really studied systematically.

00:21:13.519 --> 00:21:16.095
And that person who really
studied it systematically,

00:21:16.095 --> 00:21:18.819
and is given credit for
developing the first vaccine,

00:21:18.819 --> 00:21:20.970
is a Scottish physician named
Edward Jenner.

00:21:20.970 --> 00:21:25.727
And he started with a similar
but different observation,

00:21:25.727 --> 00:21:30.745
and that was that cows get a
disease that's very similar to

00:21:30.745 --> 00:21:34.177
smallpox.
We know now that it's caused by

00:21:34.177 --> 00:21:37.079
a related virus,
called vaccinia,

00:21:37.079 --> 00:21:40.651
remember the virus that causes
smallpox is called

00:21:40.651 --> 00:21:43.374
variola.
But variola,

00:21:43.374 --> 00:21:46.752
which causes smallpox in
humans, and vaccinia,

00:21:46.752 --> 00:21:50.000
which causes a disease called
cowpox in cattle,

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.839
turned out to be,
we now know,

00:21:51.839 --> 00:21:54.630
viruses that are molecularly
very similar.

00:21:54.630 --> 00:21:58.649
What was known at that time
was that there was a disease in

00:21:58.649 --> 00:22:01.826
people, and there was a
different disease in cows,

00:22:01.826 --> 00:22:04.289
and they looked the same some
way.

00:22:04.289 --> 00:22:07.792
And Jenner made the observation
that others had made,

00:22:07.792 --> 00:22:11.564
that people that were around
cows a lot tended not to get

00:22:11.564 --> 00:22:13.570
smallpox.
And in particular,

00:22:13.570 --> 00:22:16.020
dairy maids,
whose responsibility was to

00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:19.726
milk cows, and so they had a
very intimate relationship with

00:22:19.726 --> 00:22:22.880
cattle,
often didn't get disease.

00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:25.900
And sometimes they developed a
mild form of the disease.

00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:28.145
They would get lesions on their
hands, for example,

00:22:28.145 --> 00:22:30.975
the part of their body that was
really in close contact with the

00:22:30.975 --> 00:22:33.974
cows.
And he hypothesized that they

00:22:33.974 --> 00:22:38.896
were getting the disease in
cows, which the disease from

00:22:38.896 --> 00:22:43.460
cows that caused a milder
disease than smallpox,

00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:46.413
and that protected them from
getting the more severe forms of

00:22:46.413 --> 00:22:49.721
smallpox later.
Well, I mentioned that this

00:22:49.721 --> 00:22:54.665
was just sort of a more modern
observation of one that had been

00:22:54.665 --> 00:22:57.073
made in the past.
This process,

00:22:57.073 --> 00:23:00.892
I said, this ancient process of
taking scabs from patients and

00:23:00.892 --> 00:23:03.897
introducing them to people you
wanted to protect,

00:23:03.897 --> 00:23:08.686
was called variolation.
And Jenner was making another

00:23:08.686 --> 00:23:13.190
observation that might be useful
that way.

00:23:13.190 --> 00:23:16.162
There were other individuals
that were making this

00:23:16.162 --> 00:23:19.201
observation at that time.
In addition to Jenner,

00:23:19.201 --> 00:23:21.685
there was a farmer named
Benjamin Jesty,

00:23:21.685 --> 00:23:26.392
who recognized that farmers,
being in contact with cows,

00:23:26.392 --> 00:23:31.250
didn't get disease as often as
non-farmers did.

00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:36.580
So, he intentionally inoculated
his wife and two children with

00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:40.600
fluid that he got from one of
his sick cows.

00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:42.799
Right.
So, he took fluid from a cowpox

00:23:42.799 --> 00:23:45.322
lesion on a cow,
and he injected it into his

00:23:45.322 --> 00:23:48.318
children and his wife,
reasoning that this would

00:23:48.318 --> 00:23:51.803
protect them from disease,
even though they didn't have as

00:23:51.803 --> 00:23:54.310
much contact with cows as
farmers did.

00:23:54.310 --> 00:23:56.809
And he was right;
they got immunity and were

00:23:56.809 --> 00:23:59.710
protected from smallpox when it
affected their community.

00:23:59.710 --> 00:24:02.980
Jenner did this in a much
more systematic way.

00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:05.755
He used not just his family,
but he used whole populations

00:24:05.755 --> 00:24:09.034
of people.
And he produced a fluid from

00:24:09.034 --> 00:24:13.172
cowpox lesions,
so these were these lesions,

00:24:13.172 --> 00:24:18.291
these skin lesions on cows.
He took this pustular fluid

00:24:18.291 --> 00:24:23.251
that was produced at this very
specific phase of the disease,

00:24:23.251 --> 00:24:27.549
and he developed a way for
giving that to people.

00:24:27.549 --> 00:24:31.134
So, 'vaccination',
the word vaccination,

00:24:31.134 --> 00:24:34.871
comes from this event.
Vacca is the,

00:24:34.871 --> 00:24:38.625
I'm sure there's a Latin
scholar in here that will

00:24:38.625 --> 00:24:42.761
correct my pronunciation,
but vacca is the Latin

00:24:42.761 --> 00:24:45.589
word for cow.
Vaccination from cows,

00:24:45.589 --> 00:24:48.619
and that's where the first
vaccine came from.

00:24:48.619 --> 00:24:52.160
And Jenner, because he was a
trained physician,

00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:56.470
because he knew something about
the scientific method,

00:24:56.470 --> 00:25:00.619
did something that these more
ancient healers had not done in

00:25:00.619 --> 00:25:03.869
the past, was that he wrote down
what he did.

00:25:03.869 --> 00:25:07.326
And he kept track of how many
people he gave the vaccines to,

00:25:07.326 --> 00:25:10.668
and then he kept track of what
would happen to those people

00:25:10.668 --> 00:25:14.009
when a smallpox infection
occurred in their community.

00:25:14.009 --> 00:25:17.202
And as a result of writing it
down and keeping track,

00:25:17.202 --> 00:25:19.289
he produced a very clear
record,

00:25:19.289 --> 00:25:24.046
and scientific evidence,
that using this procedure could

00:25:24.046 --> 00:25:28.369
protect a population of people
from the disease.

00:25:28.369 --> 00:25:35.730
So, that was the start of the
modern practice of vaccination.

00:25:35.730 --> 00:25:38.163
There were problems with
Jenner's approach,

00:25:38.163 --> 00:25:41.019
and you can imagine what some
of those problems are.

00:25:41.019 --> 00:25:45.348
One is that you got to get the
vaccine from cows,

00:25:45.348 --> 00:25:50.487
so you got to have an infected
cow in order to produce the

00:25:50.487 --> 00:25:53.148
vaccine.
So, it's awkward to have to

00:25:53.148 --> 00:25:56.421
wait for a cow to get infected
before you can vaccinate a

00:25:56.421 --> 00:25:58.694
population.
What if you're talking about a

00:25:58.694 --> 00:26:01.506
group of people that don't have
any cows in their vicinity,

00:26:01.506 --> 00:26:04.484
let alone a sick cow?
How do you get the vaccine to

00:26:04.484 --> 00:26:07.180
them?
Well, that problem was partly

00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:10.460
solved by saying,
'Well, if I'm giving the

00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:14.539
inoculation to one person,
and they develop a lesion

00:26:14.539 --> 00:26:17.339
locally…'
and that's what would happen.

00:26:17.339 --> 00:26:20.314
When you would take the fluid
from the cow,

00:26:20.314 --> 00:26:24.138
and you would inject it
underneath the skin of a person

00:26:24.138 --> 00:26:27.884
you wanted to protect,
then at that site where you

00:26:27.884 --> 00:26:31.624
injected it, you would get a
lesion that looked like a

00:26:31.624 --> 00:26:34.992
smallpox or cowpox lesion.
And it would go through these

00:26:34.992 --> 00:26:36.680
same phases that I described
before.

00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:40.250
And it would,
you'd get a clear blister-like

00:26:40.250 --> 00:26:44.569
region, it would turn pustular.
Eventually you develop a scab,

00:26:44.569 --> 00:26:46.886
as it healed,
and then it would--and then the

00:26:46.886 --> 00:26:49.730
scab would fall off,
and you'd be left with a scar.

00:26:49.730 --> 00:26:53.578
But what if instead of
taking the fluid from a cow,

00:26:53.578 --> 00:26:58.110
I inoculated--he inoculated me,
let's say, and waited until I

00:26:58.110 --> 00:27:02.171
had the lesion at the right
stage, then took some of my

00:27:02.171 --> 00:27:06.757
fluid and gave it to Brian and
Nate and Mirtalla and spread it

00:27:06.757 --> 00:27:10.784
through the community around me.
Now we don't need the cow

00:27:10.784 --> 00:27:13.771
anymore because you could pass
it from one person to another,

00:27:13.771 --> 00:27:16.360
and pass the immunity from one
person to another.

00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:20.048
And that works.
The problem with it is that you

00:27:20.048 --> 00:27:23.480
also can spread other diseases
in that way.

00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:25.269
You're not only spreading the
infection.

00:27:25.269 --> 00:27:29.163
If I happen to have some other
infectious disease,

00:27:29.163 --> 00:27:34.009
then not only would you passing
the protection to smallpox,

00:27:34.009 --> 00:27:37.405
but you'd be passing that
disease among the population as

00:27:37.405 --> 00:27:39.625
well.
And it turned out that another,

00:27:39.625 --> 00:27:42.522
not quite as deadly,
but still very serious disease

00:27:42.522 --> 00:27:45.940
called syphilis was also common
in this part of the world at

00:27:45.940 --> 00:27:48.724
that time.
And so you could pass diseases

00:27:48.724 --> 00:27:51.660
like syphilis from one
individual to another.

00:27:51.660 --> 00:27:55.930
And that's not great, right?
That's not perfect.

00:27:55.930 --> 00:27:59.497
The other problem is that
as it was passed from me to

00:27:59.497 --> 00:28:02.299
another individual,
to another individual,

00:28:02.299 --> 00:28:06.367
then the vaccine could change
in some ways that were hard to

00:28:06.367 --> 00:28:10.365
predict because what accumulates
in the lesion in my arm is

00:28:10.365 --> 00:28:14.570
different in some way than what
accumulates in the lesion on a

00:28:14.570 --> 00:28:17.546
cow.
And as you move through the

00:28:17.546 --> 00:28:21.442
human population,
the kind of response that you

00:28:21.442 --> 00:28:26.438
get could change because the
virus itself mutates or because

00:28:26.438 --> 00:28:30.842
you're also passing on some
factors that provide some

00:28:30.842 --> 00:28:35.160
protection that changes the
course of disease in the

00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:38.939
recipient.
So, as the vaccine was passed

00:28:38.939 --> 00:28:41.782
from arm to arm,
it became less potent,

00:28:41.782 --> 00:28:46.420
and the length of protection
that it would give you varied.

00:28:46.420 --> 00:28:49.143
So, if you were someone that
was getting it after it had been

00:28:49.143 --> 00:28:53.170
passed through many people,
you wouldn't have as strong or

00:28:53.170 --> 00:28:57.960
as lengthy a protection as the
first individual did.

00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:00.369
And we're going to just keep
that in mind.

00:29:00.369 --> 00:29:03.267
We're going to talk about the
reasons for that as we go along,

00:29:03.267 --> 00:29:05.690
particularly at the beginning
of class next time.

00:29:05.690 --> 00:29:09.579
But what was really needed
in order to do this was a

00:29:09.579 --> 00:29:11.630
defined preparation,
right?

00:29:11.630 --> 00:29:15.757
We--what you would like to give
is everybody in the community

00:29:15.757 --> 00:29:20.767
exactly the same preparation,
so that you could predict what

00:29:20.767 --> 00:29:25.180
everybody's response to the
vaccine would be.

00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:30.911
It wasn't until the 20^(th)
century, so almost 200 years

00:29:30.911 --> 00:29:35.079
later, that we learned how to do
this.

00:29:35.079 --> 00:29:40.529
And it was based on a couple of
things.

00:29:40.529 --> 00:29:43.952
One was, a better understanding
of what you were doing when you

00:29:43.952 --> 00:29:46.882
vaccinated.
And I've already given you some

00:29:46.882 --> 00:29:49.736
clues about this,
in that this process of

00:29:49.736 --> 00:29:53.589
vaccination that Jenner had
developed was intentionally

00:29:53.589 --> 00:29:58.369
injecting into healthy patients,
a microorganism.

00:29:58.369 --> 00:30:01.147
In this case the virus
vaccinia,

00:30:01.147 --> 00:30:05.606
which causes a serious disease
in cows but only a mild disease

00:30:05.606 --> 00:30:09.252
in people,
and injecting that--because it

00:30:09.252 --> 00:30:14.408
was similar to variola,
or the smallpox causing virus

00:30:14.408 --> 00:30:18.059
in some way,
so that your immune system

00:30:18.059 --> 00:30:21.750
would develop a response to
vaccinia.

00:30:21.750 --> 00:30:24.868
But because of the
similarity of the viruses,

00:30:24.868 --> 00:30:28.701
the immune response that people
developed would also protect

00:30:28.701 --> 00:30:32.339
them against natural infections
with variola.

00:30:32.339 --> 00:30:36.790
And so we call that now,
that process of infecting with

00:30:36.790 --> 00:30:39.553
a life virus,
that produces an immune

00:30:39.553 --> 00:30:42.930
response that cross-reacts with
another,

00:30:42.930 --> 00:30:46.758
that's called a naturally
occurring, attenuated vaccine:

00:30:46.758 --> 00:30:50.864
naturally occurring because we
took a virus that occurred in

00:30:50.864 --> 00:30:54.457
nature;
attenuated because it causes an

00:30:54.457 --> 00:30:59.201
immune response in people but a
mild form of disease,

00:30:59.201 --> 00:31:04.612
not the full form of disease.
And so this is an example of a

00:31:04.612 --> 00:31:08.019
naturally occurring,
attenuated vaccine.

00:31:08.019 --> 00:31:12.298
So, how could you produce--the
question is, how could you

00:31:12.298 --> 00:31:16.730
produce large quantities of
this- of this microorganism,

00:31:16.730 --> 00:31:20.369
this virus vaccinia
under controlled conditions?

00:31:20.369 --> 00:31:23.569
Now, you know,
because we talked about cell

00:31:23.569 --> 00:31:26.629
culture already,
that a great--that we talked

00:31:26.629 --> 00:31:29.690
about last week,
manufacturing of cells.

00:31:29.690 --> 00:31:32.444
We talked about two weeks ago,
that if you had a population of

00:31:32.444 --> 00:31:34.882
cells, you could grow those
population of cells and you

00:31:34.882 --> 00:31:36.964
could make,
if they adapted the culture

00:31:36.964 --> 00:31:39.879
properly, you could make an
infinite number of cells from

00:31:39.879 --> 00:31:43.110
one starting solution.
Well, if you knew a cell that

00:31:43.110 --> 00:31:46.572
could serve as a host for a
virus, you could use this

00:31:46.572 --> 00:31:50.367
process of cell culture to make
large quantities of virus,

00:31:50.367 --> 00:31:52.367
right?
You just grow up cells until

00:31:52.367 --> 00:31:55.763
you've got a lot of cells.
You infect them with the virus,

00:31:55.763 --> 00:31:59.549
and you let the cells,
in culture, produce the virus.

00:31:59.549 --> 00:32:02.980
Well, it turns out that we
could not identify,

00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:07.097
at least at that point,
a cell culture that would serve

00:32:07.097 --> 00:32:11.173
as a host for vaccinia.
So cell culture production

00:32:11.173 --> 00:32:14.147
wasn't an option.
The only way that we knew

00:32:14.147 --> 00:32:18.042
how to grow it reliably was to
grow it in its natural host:

00:32:18.042 --> 00:32:20.373
cows.
And so in the 1940s,

00:32:20.373 --> 00:32:25.037
a group of people led by
Collier started to develop a

00:32:25.037 --> 00:32:30.418
large scale production method
for making a reliable source of

00:32:30.418 --> 00:32:33.912
vaccinia virus.
And they did that by

00:32:33.912 --> 00:32:37.129
intentionally infecting calves,
by harvesting their skin when

00:32:37.129 --> 00:32:39.650
they were at a certain point of
the disease,

00:32:39.650 --> 00:32:44.059
and by isolating the virus from
the skin of the calves.

00:32:44.059 --> 00:32:47.114
And of course,
you could imagine that this

00:32:47.114 --> 00:32:50.801
took some time to develop.
You'd want to make sure that

00:32:50.801 --> 00:32:54.346
you separated the virus from all
the other parts of cow skin so

00:32:54.346 --> 00:32:57.720
that your ultimate preparation
was enriched in the virus and

00:32:57.720 --> 00:33:00.807
didn't contain quantities of
other things that would be

00:33:00.807 --> 00:33:03.675
hazardous.
And so that's what was done in

00:33:03.675 --> 00:33:06.274
the 1940s.
And then they found that

00:33:06.274 --> 00:33:09.471
they could freeze-dry this
preparation of virus,

00:33:09.471 --> 00:33:12.599
and freeze-drying to lower the
temperature,

00:33:12.599 --> 00:33:15.480
freeze it, then extract out all
the water, so you're left with a

00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:17.720
powder, basically a powdered
form of the virus,

00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:20.305
that could be shipped all over
the world, and then

00:33:20.305 --> 00:33:22.309
reconstituted by adding water to
it.

00:33:22.309 --> 00:33:31.940
Right, so it's like--it's like
Kool-Aid, but more potent.

00:33:31.940 --> 00:33:35.911
But used the same way, right?
The powder you could ship

00:33:35.911 --> 00:33:38.226
anywhere, and reconstitute it
onsite, and then it gets

00:33:38.226 --> 00:33:40.346
injected.
And they also developed a very

00:33:40.346 --> 00:33:43.646
reliable way for introducing the
virus, so that when they had a

00:33:43.646 --> 00:33:46.524
defined preparation of virus,
then you want to make sure that

00:33:46.524 --> 00:33:48.420
everybody gets it in their skin
in the right way.

00:33:48.420 --> 00:33:51.366
So, they developed this
bifurcated tool,

00:33:51.366 --> 00:33:55.974
which would be appl--you'd put
the stuff on the surface of the

00:33:55.974 --> 00:34:00.506
tool and then you'd scratch the
skin in a certain way so that

00:34:00.506 --> 00:34:04.963
you could produce sort of a
reproducible introduction of the

00:34:04.963 --> 00:34:08.484
vaccine into the skin.
Availability of this

00:34:08.484 --> 00:34:11.516
freeze-dried vaccine made it,
then, possible to think about

00:34:11.516 --> 00:34:13.659
vaccinating people all over the
world.

00:34:13.659 --> 00:34:18.310
And so it didn't take long,
once this vaccine were--was

00:34:18.310 --> 00:34:23.564
available, for people to want to
get organized and think about

00:34:23.564 --> 00:34:28.904
ways of delivering this vaccine
to all the regions of the world

00:34:28.904 --> 00:34:32.780
where people were potentially
infected.

00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:34.812
It was the World Health
Organization,

00:34:34.812 --> 00:34:38.708
or WHO, which led this effort.
And the goal was to eradicate

00:34:38.708 --> 00:34:42.742
the virus, to get rid of it so
that there were no natural

00:34:42.742 --> 00:34:45.480
sources of the virus on the
planet.

00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:48.416
And that was possible in
smallpox because of a few

00:34:48.416 --> 00:34:52.131
characteristics of the disease:
one is that it's a--it's purely

00:34:52.131 --> 00:34:55.859
a human disease,
humans are the only organisms

00:34:55.859 --> 00:34:59.860
that are affected by it.
That's important, right?

00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:04.333
Because if it was a disease
that was carried by both humans

00:35:04.333 --> 00:35:06.570
and squirrels,
for example,

00:35:06.570 --> 00:35:08.550
then in order to get rid of it
on the planet,

00:35:08.550 --> 00:35:11.159
you'd have to vaccinate not
only all the people but all the

00:35:11.159 --> 00:35:12.800
squirrels,
right?

00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:16.070
Otherwise you could have a
squirrel host--I'm using

00:35:16.070 --> 00:35:19.405
squirrels, because I think
that's funnier than other

00:35:19.405 --> 00:35:23.330
animals to think of--but it
could be any potential host,

00:35:23.330 --> 00:35:25.867
right?
And it would be really

00:35:25.867 --> 00:35:28.949
difficult to vaccinate a
wildlife.

00:35:28.949 --> 00:35:31.960
So there are no non-human
reservoirs.

00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:34.750
There were no asymptomatic
carriers.

00:35:34.750 --> 00:35:37.429
So if you got infected with
smallpox, you got the disease.

00:35:37.429 --> 00:35:40.717
There weren't people that got
infected, like you can get

00:35:40.717 --> 00:35:43.168
infected with hepatitis B or
tuberculosis,

00:35:43.168 --> 00:35:45.440
and not even know you're
infected.

00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:48.305
You might not know have any
symptoms, you might just have a

00:35:48.305 --> 00:35:50.825
latent source of the
microorganism somewhere in your

00:35:50.825 --> 00:35:52.233
body.
And that didn't happen with

00:35:52.233 --> 00:35:54.023
smallpox.
That's important,

00:35:54.023 --> 00:35:58.659
too, because you need to be
able to tell if the virus is

00:35:58.659 --> 00:36:02.905
present in the human population.
And so because of those two

00:36:02.905 --> 00:36:05.400
things you could think about
eradicating the virus.

00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:07.261
They did this very
systematically,

00:36:07.261 --> 00:36:10.420
by giving quantities of the
vaccine to countries all over

00:36:10.420 --> 00:36:12.599
the world.
That's part of it, right?

00:36:12.599 --> 00:36:15.960
Give enough of the vaccine so
you have a dose for everybody in

00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:18.550
the world, or a large fraction
of the people.

00:36:18.550 --> 00:36:21.111
We'll think about it in
section, how you don't need to

00:36:21.111 --> 00:36:23.527
vaccinate everybody,
but you just need to vaccinate

00:36:23.527 --> 00:36:25.943
a critical number in order to
stop the disease from

00:36:25.943 --> 00:36:29.195
progressing through a community.
And we'll think about that in

00:36:29.195 --> 00:36:31.711
section on Thursday.
But so you needed enough

00:36:31.711 --> 00:36:34.480
doses, but this is real,
and this is a lot of people,

00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:36.719
right?
So you need hundreds of

00:36:36.719 --> 00:36:40.466
millions of doses,
at least, and you need a way to

00:36:40.466 --> 00:36:43.219
distribute that around the
world,

00:36:43.219 --> 00:36:46.654
and you need a way to keep
track of who got sick and who

00:36:46.654 --> 00:36:48.840
didn't after they got
vaccinated.

00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:50.500
So you needed some way of
reporting.

00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:53.591
And the WHO had all those,
had that whole infrastructure

00:36:53.591 --> 00:36:55.832
in place.
So they kept track of

00:36:55.832 --> 00:36:59.000
country-by-country,
when cases of smallpox

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:03.095
occurred, and as it was
eliminated from regions of the

00:37:03.095 --> 00:37:05.609
country,
they then certified those

00:37:05.609 --> 00:37:09.273
regions to be smallpox free.
And so it went,

00:37:09.273 --> 00:37:14.510
through the years from the
1950s through the 1970s.

00:37:14.510 --> 00:37:19.425
The last reported case of
smallpox in the--naturally

00:37:19.425 --> 00:37:22.413
occurring smallpox,
was in 1977,

00:37:22.413 --> 00:37:27.905
a man in Somalia was infected.
There were no reported cases

00:37:27.905 --> 00:37:32.573
after that, and so by the late
'70s, the world was certified

00:37:32.573 --> 00:37:35.580
sort of free of smallpox
worldwide.

00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:38.562
The U.S.
was certified free in the early

00:37:38.562 --> 00:37:42.066
'70s, years before that.
I was born before 1970,

00:37:42.066 --> 00:37:46.177
I got a smallpox vaccination.
None of you got smallpox

00:37:46.177 --> 00:37:48.838
vaccinations,
because once a country was

00:37:48.838 --> 00:37:53.649
certified to be smallpox free,
there was no reason to--there

00:37:53.649 --> 00:37:57.710
was no reason to vaccinate
people any longer.

00:37:57.710 --> 00:38:02.212
So, none of you in this room,
I'm 100% confident,

00:38:02.212 --> 00:38:05.590
never ever got a smallpox
vaccine.

00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:16.283
Well, that's a great story,
and it's an example of a great

00:38:16.283 --> 00:38:21.067
success in medicine.
But it's also an example of a

00:38:21.067 --> 00:38:24.260
great success in biomedical
engineering.

00:38:24.260 --> 00:38:27.915
And the engineering part of
that is sort of the part that I

00:38:27.915 --> 00:38:31.260
talked about in one slide,
when I talked about how do you

00:38:31.260 --> 00:38:34.263
convert this scientific advance
into something that can be

00:38:34.263 --> 00:38:39.411
delivered all over the world.
And the technology that was

00:38:39.411 --> 00:38:47.489
used in this case was growing
the vaccine in a natural source,

00:38:47.489 --> 00:38:50.169
harvesting it,
figuring out how to produce a

00:38:50.169 --> 00:38:53.284
preparation that could be
distributed but was still

00:38:53.284 --> 00:38:56.482
biologically active;
that is, still could protect

00:38:56.482 --> 00:38:59.008
against the disease.
We now know,

00:38:59.008 --> 00:39:03.378
and I'm going to talk about
next time, lots of ways to do

00:39:03.378 --> 00:39:07.670
this, alternatives to this
method of bioengineering.

00:39:07.670 --> 00:39:11.570
And you could guess what those
techniques are.

00:39:11.570 --> 00:39:14.831
You could use cell culture,
so you don't have to grow the

00:39:14.831 --> 00:39:18.579
virus naturally in animals.
But you can grow it in cultured

00:39:18.579 --> 00:39:22.365
cells, and the advantages of
that are that you can do this

00:39:22.365 --> 00:39:24.889
under very reproducible
conditions.

00:39:24.889 --> 00:39:28.895
Much easier to keep a flask of
cells under very sterile,

00:39:28.895 --> 00:39:32.828
very reproducible conditions
than it is to keep a small

00:39:32.828 --> 00:39:36.008
animal, right?
Even--or a large animal like a

00:39:36.008 --> 00:39:38.270
cow.
And much easier to purify and

00:39:38.270 --> 00:39:41.901
know what you have at the end,
than if you're trying to

00:39:41.901 --> 00:39:44.860
harvest it from a whole complex
organism.

00:39:44.860 --> 00:39:47.856
We have techniques of
recombinant DNA,

00:39:47.856 --> 00:39:51.949
and those can be used to
produce either modified viruses,

00:39:51.949 --> 00:39:55.303
we'll talk about that.
So maybe I could take an

00:39:55.303 --> 00:39:57.966
infe--maybe I could instead of
getting lucky,

00:39:57.966 --> 00:40:01.357
like we did in smallpox and
finding a naturally occurring

00:40:01.357 --> 00:40:04.989
organism that causes an
attenuated form of the disease,

00:40:04.989 --> 00:40:08.495
maybe we could genetically
engineer a virus,

00:40:08.495 --> 00:40:11.430
to make it less pathogenic,
right,

00:40:11.430 --> 00:40:16.019
but still immunogenic, right?
And those words mean different

00:40:16.019 --> 00:40:18.848
things: immunogenic means that
it stimulates your immune system

00:40:18.848 --> 00:40:21.943
for a response;
pathogenic means that it causes

00:40:21.943 --> 00:40:24.739
a disease.
So maybe you could figure out

00:40:24.739 --> 00:40:28.099
how to use what we know about
molecular biology,

00:40:28.099 --> 00:40:31.621
to engineer a new virus that's
still immunogenic,

00:40:31.621 --> 00:40:37.557
but not pathogenic any longer.
And that's a new approach to

00:40:37.557 --> 00:40:41.782
producing vaccines.
Or maybe you don't need the

00:40:41.782 --> 00:40:44.212
whole virus.
Maybe you don't need the whole

00:40:44.212 --> 00:40:47.100
virus, but you could just use a
piece of the virus,

00:40:47.100 --> 00:40:48.510
right?
Just use a piece,

00:40:48.510 --> 00:40:50.239
an antigenic piece of the
virus.

00:40:50.239 --> 00:40:54.093
And then I don't have to
produce the whole virus in order

00:40:54.093 --> 00:40:57.018
to make a vaccine.
I just have to produce many,

00:40:57.018 --> 00:40:59.562
many copies of a piece of the
virus, a protein,

00:40:59.562 --> 00:41:01.560
say.
And how would you produce a

00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:04.742
protein in large quantities?
Well, again you could use

00:41:04.742 --> 00:41:08.060
recombinant DNA technology.
Get a gene, put it in a

00:41:08.060 --> 00:41:11.367
plasmid, get that plasmid
expressed in a host,

00:41:11.367 --> 00:41:14.380
could even be a bacterial host,
right?

00:41:14.380 --> 00:41:15.780
Like we talked about with
insulin;

00:41:15.780 --> 00:41:20.584
make large quantities of this
recombinant viral protein,

00:41:20.584 --> 00:41:24.969
and use that as a vaccine.
And we're going to talk about

00:41:24.969 --> 00:41:28.179
how that--how those steps can
happen next time.

00:41:28.179 --> 00:41:31.050
I want to end with this
picture.

00:41:31.050 --> 00:41:34.594
So this is the cover of the New
England Journal of Medicine,

00:41:34.594 --> 00:41:38.018
one of the most famous and
influential medical journals in

00:41:38.018 --> 00:41:41.670
the world.
And this is from April of 2002.

00:41:41.670 --> 00:41:45.396
And I talked about eradicating
smallpox in 1977,

00:41:45.396 --> 00:41:49.440
right when officially the last
case was reported,

00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:52.659
and it was certified to be
eradicated shortly after that.

00:41:52.659 --> 00:41:56.471
But on this cover,
you can see that there are

00:41:56.471 --> 00:42:00.946
several stories about smallpox.
One is called the 'Clinical

00:42:00.946 --> 00:42:04.179
Responses to Undiluted and
Diluted Smallpox Vaccine';

00:42:04.179 --> 00:42:07.554
one is called 'Current
Concepts, Diagnosis and

00:42:07.554 --> 00:42:11.349
Management of Smallpox.
' Why would one of the most

00:42:11.349 --> 00:42:15.401
prominent and influential
medical journals in the world be

00:42:15.401 --> 00:42:19.310
publishing a review article
about how to manage cases of

00:42:19.310 --> 00:42:23.575
smallpox when there had not been
any cases of smallpox for 25

00:42:23.575 --> 00:42:25.578
years?
Yeah.Student:

00:42:25.578 --> 00:42:27.691
Bioterrorism?Professor
Mark Saltzman:

00:42:27.691 --> 00:42:30.874
So, the concern at this time,
and still remains a concern,

00:42:30.874 --> 00:42:33.989
is that infectious agents,
particularly very deadly

00:42:33.989 --> 00:42:37.614
infectious agents like smallpox,
could be weaponized in some

00:42:37.614 --> 00:42:41.973
way, or converted into a weapon.
And if smallpox was somehow

00:42:41.973 --> 00:42:47.929
introduced into a city like New
York City, what would happen?

00:42:47.929 --> 00:42:50.760
Well, there's a whole
population of people who are

00:42:50.760 --> 00:42:53.532
younger than me that never got
smallpox vaccines,

00:42:53.532 --> 00:42:54.996
right?
You don't have it,

00:42:54.996 --> 00:42:57.854
you don't have any immunity to
smallpox, you don't have any

00:42:57.854 --> 00:43:02.329
reason to immunity to smallpox.
And so you would be susceptible

00:43:02.329 --> 00:43:06.152
to infection by this organism.
In addition,

00:43:06.152 --> 00:43:09.732
even people--I got vaccinated
40 years ago,

00:43:09.732 --> 00:43:12.920
right?
Is my vaccine still protective?

00:43:12.920 --> 00:43:15.923
Probably not.
And so even people that got

00:43:15.923 --> 00:43:19.338
vaccinated, most of us either
have questionable or no

00:43:19.338 --> 00:43:22.360
protection against the virus at
this point.

00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:24.893
And who,
where would--If it was,

00:43:24.893 --> 00:43:29.092
if it was converted into a
weapon, where would the vaccines

00:43:29.092 --> 00:43:32.639
to protect the rest of the
country come from?

00:43:32.639 --> 00:43:35.679
There's no company that's
making smallpox vaccine anymore

00:43:35.679 --> 00:43:38.393
because there's no reason to
make smallpox vaccine,

00:43:38.393 --> 00:43:40.510
because nobody would buy it,
right?

00:43:40.510 --> 00:43:42.739
Because there's no naturally
occurring smallpox.

00:43:42.739 --> 00:43:47.060
And so there was great concern
that we were vulnerable in this

00:43:47.060 --> 00:43:50.815
way, because the disease is
still a disease that could

00:43:50.815 --> 00:43:55.200
affect people.
There are still some active

00:43:55.200 --> 00:44:02.112
smallpox virus specimens kept in
the world, and there are two

00:44:02.112 --> 00:44:09.140
sources of small--two places
where smallpox is stored now.

00:44:09.140 --> 00:44:12.121
One is in the U.S.
at the Centers for Disease

00:44:12.121 --> 00:44:15.932
Control, where there is a sample
of variola,

00:44:15.932 --> 00:44:19.133
which is kept,
you know, frozen on ice in a

00:44:19.133 --> 00:44:23.613
heavily guarded facility.
There's another sample which is

00:44:23.613 --> 00:44:26.586
in Russia, part of the former
Soviet Union,

00:44:26.586 --> 00:44:29.699
where there are samples that
were stored.

00:44:29.699 --> 00:44:33.289
And these samples are used for
scientific purposes.

00:44:33.289 --> 00:44:38.256
They are kept track of very
closely, but because there's

00:44:38.256 --> 00:44:42.139
still smallpox that exists on
the planet,

00:44:42.139 --> 00:44:47.988
there is some concern that that
could be obtained and used to

00:44:47.988 --> 00:44:51.909
develop a weapon.
So, that's the reason for it.

00:44:51.909 --> 00:44:55.679
Shortly after this,
and why did that come up 2002?

00:44:55.679 --> 00:44:59.364
Because of what happened in
2001, is why that became a

00:44:59.364 --> 00:45:01.180
concern.
The government,

00:45:01.180 --> 00:45:04.019
after this time,
did issue contracts to

00:45:04.019 --> 00:45:08.128
manufacturing companies to
produce new quantities of the

00:45:08.128 --> 00:45:11.088
virus.
They also found some stockpiles

00:45:11.088 --> 00:45:15.364
of the virus from the 1950s that
they still had on an Army base

00:45:15.364 --> 00:45:18.202
in Maryland, I think.
They tested those to see if

00:45:18.202 --> 00:45:19.909
they were still active,
and they were.

00:45:19.909 --> 00:45:24.952
So, there's been an active
effort to reestablish the

00:45:24.952 --> 00:45:30.489
process of smallpox vaccination
in case that's needed.

00:45:30.489 --> 00:45:34.282
There are even some military
personnel now who get immunized

00:45:34.282 --> 00:45:37.947
against smallpox in the event
that when they're going into

00:45:37.947 --> 00:45:41.307
areas,
they might be exposed when

00:45:41.307 --> 00:45:45.684
they're in combat areas.
And so, I give you this

00:45:45.684 --> 00:45:49.409
example to say even though
tremendous progress was made.

00:45:49.409 --> 00:45:52.367
This is one example that,
without fail,

00:45:52.367 --> 00:45:56.960
people would say is a marvel of
medicine and bioengineering,

00:45:56.960 --> 00:46:00.929
but that it's still something
to keep track of.

00:46:00.929 --> 00:46:04.854
There are still opportunities
to use what we know about this

00:46:04.854 --> 00:46:09.506
to develop even better methods.
I think the smallpox vaccine we

00:46:09.506 --> 00:46:13.388
made now would probably be
better, more effective,

00:46:13.388 --> 00:46:17.429
and safer than the vaccines we
made in the '50s.

00:46:17.429 --> 00:46:20.282
So, I'm going to continue
talking about vaccines on

00:46:20.282 --> 00:46:21.827
Thursday.
In particular,

00:46:21.827 --> 00:46:25.299
we're going to focus in the
beginning, on polio virus,

00:46:25.299 --> 00:46:27.920
which is another great success
story,

00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:31.281
but where a very different
approach to vaccine development

00:46:31.281 --> 00:46:33.813
was used.
That will be instructive in

00:46:33.813 --> 00:46:38.000
thinking about what vaccines in
the future might look like.

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:44.000
Questions?
Great, see you on Thursday.

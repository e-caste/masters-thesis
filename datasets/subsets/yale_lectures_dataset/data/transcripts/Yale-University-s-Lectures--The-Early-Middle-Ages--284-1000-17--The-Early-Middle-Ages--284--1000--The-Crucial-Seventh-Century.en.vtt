00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:03.267
PAUL FREEDMAN: So we
had talked about the

00:00:03.267 --> 00:00:05.933
mathematical researches of the

00:00:05.933 --> 00:00:09.933
Arabs combining Persian, Greek,
and Indian mathematics

00:00:09.933 --> 00:00:13.000
and, of course, with
contributions of their own.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.467
So that the enumeration, the
use of zero are from India,

00:00:19.467 --> 00:00:25.333
but the development of algebra
is a unique contribution of

00:00:25.333 --> 00:00:27.833
this period and of
these people.

00:00:27.833 --> 00:00:31.467
Let's talk briefly
about geography.

00:00:31.467 --> 00:00:34.033
Remember the chapter in
Wickham opens with the

00:00:34.033 --> 00:00:37.567
contemptuous description of
Palermo by the tenth century

00:00:37.567 --> 00:00:48.600
geographer, Ibn Hawqal,
H-A-W-Q-A-L. And the point of

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.267
that is not Palermo or anything
like that, but just

00:00:54.267 --> 00:00:59.967
the fascination that the Muslim
world had for travel,

00:00:59.967 --> 00:01:01.967
for geography.

00:01:01.967 --> 00:01:05.033
Geography both of a quantitative
kind-- measuring,

00:01:05.033 --> 00:01:08.433
navigation, figuring out to
get from place to place--

00:01:08.433 --> 00:01:15.033
and of a kind of curiosities
of the world kind, of

00:01:15.033 --> 00:01:19.500
different customs, different
peoples, different products.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.900
So these geographers were
employed by the caliphs, for

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.467
example, to figure out the
circumference of the world, to

00:01:29.467 --> 00:01:32.233
figure out the relationship
between land and

00:01:32.233 --> 00:01:33.600
water in the world.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.733
This is an interesting
form of speculation.

00:01:38.733 --> 00:01:43.467
If you look at Christian maps of
the world up to 1300 or so,

00:01:43.467 --> 00:01:47.867
they show almost no oceans,
It's all huge

00:01:47.867 --> 00:01:50.433
amounts of land mass.

00:01:50.433 --> 00:01:54.667
This is partly, it's thought, an
interpretation of something

00:01:54.667 --> 00:01:59.100
in one of the apocryphal books
of the Bible that seems to

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.967
suggest that seven-eighths
of the world is land.

00:02:02.967 --> 00:02:05.967
Ptolemy, whom we spoke about
last time, the Greek

00:02:05.967 --> 00:02:09.567
geographer, author of this book
known as the Almagest or

00:02:09.567 --> 00:02:13.033
Geography, translated into
Arabic as one of the first

00:02:13.033 --> 00:02:15.567
projects of this House
of Wisdom in Baghdad.

00:02:15.567 --> 00:02:18.200
Ptolemy has a different
picture.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.000
And Ptolemy is the first
geographer received in the

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.333
medieval period to suggest
that there's an

00:02:24.333 --> 00:02:25.700
awful lot of water.

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.167
And that you could get around
much of the world by water.

00:02:29.167 --> 00:02:32.467
Although crucially, Ptolemy does
not think that you can go

00:02:32.467 --> 00:02:34.633
around Africa.

00:02:34.633 --> 00:02:37.300
Ptolemy has a kind of Antarctic
land mass that

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:38.967
connects with Africa.

00:02:38.967 --> 00:02:42.167
And it was only the Portuguese
at the end of

00:02:42.167 --> 00:02:43.667
the fifteenth century--

00:02:43.667 --> 00:02:47.667
specifically in 1498,
well really, 1489--

00:02:47.667 --> 00:02:51.233
who demonstrated that you could
go around Africa, and

00:02:51.233 --> 00:02:53.733
thus from the Atlantic Ocean
into the Indian Ocean.

00:02:53.733 --> 00:02:56.033
Crucial, crucial discovery.

00:02:56.033 --> 00:02:58.700
But this question of how much
water is there versus how much

00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:59.833
land is there--

00:02:59.833 --> 00:03:02.267
a sense of the entire world--

00:03:02.267 --> 00:03:07.600
is a problem investigated
by these geographers.

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.700
Many of these guys are
indefatigable travelers.

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:24.000
So there's this book by
Al-Muqaddasi, M-U-Q-A-D-D,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.067
usually known in English as
the Best Division for

00:03:27.067 --> 00:03:28.833
Knowledge of the Regions.

00:03:28.833 --> 00:03:33.967
Completed in 985 after twenty
years of traveling.

00:03:33.967 --> 00:03:38.033
But the greatest traveler of
the Islamic premodern world

00:03:38.033 --> 00:03:45.133
was Ibn Khaldun, who is much
later but worth at least

00:03:45.133 --> 00:03:49.900
mentioning here, 1332 to 1406.

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.867
And he started from his native
Tunis and traveled as far as

00:03:53.867 --> 00:03:58.167
China and Indonesia.

00:03:58.167 --> 00:04:07.900
And then, finally, a scholar
named al-Idrisi, another one

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.967
of these travelers, geographers,
was hired by the

00:04:10.967 --> 00:04:15.667
Christian king of Sicily, Roger
the Second, in 1138 to

00:04:15.667 --> 00:04:18.567
put together a map of the
world with accompanying

00:04:18.567 --> 00:04:20.133
descriptive texts.

00:04:20.133 --> 00:04:26.900
And it is an aspect both of the
respect accorded to the

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.233
Arab geographers in the
Christian world, and the fact

00:04:30.233 --> 00:04:34.367
that despite our tendency to
see these two worlds as

00:04:34.367 --> 00:04:39.033
opposed-- after all 1138 is
the era of the Crusades--

00:04:39.033 --> 00:04:42.700
there's quite a fair amount of
collaboration, interchange of

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.600
knowledge between the Christian
kingdoms of Europe,

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.733
and the Islamic world--

00:04:49.733 --> 00:04:51.000
the Islamic kingdoms--

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.433
of the Southern Mediterranean
and the Middle East.

00:04:55.433 --> 00:04:57.667
Finally, medicine.

00:04:57.667 --> 00:04:59.800
We're not exhausting the subject
studied by the Arabs,

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.933
but I wanted to give you math,
geography, and medicine as

00:05:02.933 --> 00:05:04.600
three examples.

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:07.467
The main authority for the
Arabs, the person that they

00:05:07.467 --> 00:05:10.633
translated with the most
assiduity and interest, was

00:05:10.633 --> 00:05:17.233
Galen, G-A-L-E-N, a physician
who wrote in Greek at the time

00:05:17.233 --> 00:05:18.767
of the Roman Empire.

00:05:18.767 --> 00:05:23.333
And Galen is the person who
is responsible for the

00:05:23.333 --> 00:05:26.400
transmission, if not invention,
of the notion of

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.233
the four bodily humors.

00:05:30.233 --> 00:05:37.400
This model of physiology
dominated medicine until the

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.200
eighteenth century, let's say.

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.867
This is the notion that within
human beings there are these

00:05:42.867 --> 00:05:47.833
four fluids that are essential
building blocks of character

00:05:47.833 --> 00:05:49.067
and of health.

00:05:49.067 --> 00:05:56.667
They are both mental and
physical factors in health or

00:05:56.667 --> 00:05:57.567
in illness.

00:05:57.567 --> 00:06:00.900
And they correspond both
to the four elements--

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:04.333
the four basic things out of
which the world is built

00:06:04.333 --> 00:06:06.067
according to Greek science--

00:06:06.067 --> 00:06:14.233
and to the interaction of the
corresponding four climates or

00:06:14.233 --> 00:06:16.500
four tendencies.

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:21.733
So the four elements: earth,
air, fire, and water.

00:06:21.733 --> 00:06:29.967
These climates or tendencies
are hot, dry, moist--

00:06:29.967 --> 00:06:31.933
hot, dry, moist, cold-- right.

00:06:31.933 --> 00:06:33.533
Hot, cold, moist, dry.

00:06:37.167 --> 00:06:38.333
And the four humors--

00:06:38.333 --> 00:06:41.733
these are liquids that are
inside our bodies--

00:06:41.733 --> 00:06:48.767
are bile or yellow bile, which
corresponds to fire, which is

00:06:48.767 --> 00:06:52.100
hot and dry.

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:58.033
Blood, which corresponds
to the element of air,

00:06:58.033 --> 00:06:59.800
and is hot and wet.

00:07:02.533 --> 00:07:09.233
Phlegm, mucus, P-H-L-E-G-M,
which corresponds to water,

00:07:09.233 --> 00:07:12.167
and is cold and wet.

00:07:12.167 --> 00:07:19.533
And, finally, black bile,
which is earth,

00:07:19.533 --> 00:07:20.767
and cold and dry.

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:28.100
Key to this idea of the humors
is the notion of balance or

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:29.000
equilibrium.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.667
And in this it resembles Chinese
medicine, Indian

00:07:33.667 --> 00:07:40.000
Ayurvedic medicine, and indeed,
at least conceptually,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.733
notions that people have
of their own bodies.

00:07:43.733 --> 00:07:49.567
That the experience of illness
or of mental distress is one

00:07:49.567 --> 00:07:53.200
of imbalance, of the
predominance of one element

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:55.167
over another.

00:07:55.167 --> 00:08:01.267
So the healthy body is in a
state of equilibrium, while

00:08:01.267 --> 00:08:06.767
disease is part of a fluctuation
due to imbalance.

00:08:06.767 --> 00:08:10.100
But people are never completely
balanced, at least

00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:11.167
not for long.

00:08:11.167 --> 00:08:14.900
Everybody has some, what's
called temperament.

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:19.767
A "temperament" is a favoring
of one of these humors.

00:08:19.767 --> 00:08:24.200
So and we still use these terms
without particularly

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:26.267
being interested in
their origins.

00:08:26.267 --> 00:08:30.467
So melancholia, or the
melancholic temperament, which

00:08:30.467 --> 00:08:34.533
is associated with sadness,
lethargy, what would be

00:08:34.533 --> 00:08:39.100
medicalized now as depression,
is from a predominance of

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:41.000
black bile.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:41.567
Melan--

00:08:41.567 --> 00:08:42.500
black.

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:43.233
Cholar--

00:08:43.233 --> 00:08:44.200
bile.

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:45.600
In Greek, melancholia.

00:08:49.133 --> 00:08:52.067
There's the choleric
temperament, people who tend

00:08:52.067 --> 00:08:53.700
to be angry, irritable.

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:56.633
And this is from regular
or yellow bile,

00:08:56.633 --> 00:08:58.300
predominance of that.

00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:03.833
Or sanguine: sort of more
optimistic, more risk taking.

00:09:03.833 --> 00:09:06.367
Predominance of blood,
the sanguinary humor.

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:15.833
This is the basis of an awful
lot of medical theory of

00:09:15.833 --> 00:09:21.933
physiology, of understanding of
disease and its treatment,

00:09:21.933 --> 00:09:27.133
as well as its prevention
through things like diet.

00:09:27.133 --> 00:09:31.000
There are lots and lots of
medical writings and doctors

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.300
in the Islamic world.

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:41.400
The most famous is known in
the West as Avicenna, Ibn

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:47.600
Sina, 980 to 1037.

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:52.467
He is a Persian, active
in Persia.

00:09:52.467 --> 00:09:55.900
And he, like many of these
doctors, was not just a

00:09:55.900 --> 00:10:00.267
physician, but a musicologist
and a philosopher.

00:10:00.267 --> 00:10:06.300
He wrote medical writings on
physiology, diagnosis,

00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:11.200
treatment, and medication.

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:15.233
His work was translated into
Latin and known in the West as

00:10:15.233 --> 00:10:16.833
the Cannon.

00:10:16.833 --> 00:10:21.533
The Cannon of Avicenna was the
standard work taught in

00:10:21.533 --> 00:10:24.300
medical schools until the

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:25.600
seventeenth, eighteenth century.

00:10:29.967 --> 00:10:35.767
Again, I wouldn't say that I
would be desperate to be alive

00:10:35.767 --> 00:10:38.133
in the eleventh century
in order to have

00:10:38.133 --> 00:10:39.400
better medical care.

00:10:44.533 --> 00:10:46.567
There is no--the humors don't
really work; it's not

00:10:46.567 --> 00:10:50.367
scientifically true,
but so what?

00:10:50.367 --> 00:10:54.733
We are interested in the world
views in aspects of how people

00:10:54.733 --> 00:10:56.233
look at things.

00:10:56.233 --> 00:10:59.367
Certainly, many aspects of
this medical care were

00:10:59.367 --> 00:11:02.400
superior to what was available
elsewhere.

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:04.533
It was based on observation.

00:11:04.533 --> 00:11:09.233
The observation obviously
couldn't be MRIs or CAT scans.

00:11:09.233 --> 00:11:14.100
The observation, however, was
much closer than that even

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:17.000
undertaken by the Greeks.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.200
An awful lot of what
might be learned of

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:22.033
disease was through urine.

00:11:22.033 --> 00:11:26.833
And the examination of the urine
is almost somewhat the

00:11:26.833 --> 00:11:32.000
symbol of being a doctor, that
in some Western illustrations

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.100
of medicine you know that the
person is a doctor because

00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:40.067
he's holding up this little
flask and examining its

00:11:40.067 --> 00:11:41.267
properties.

00:11:41.267 --> 00:11:44.333
So, again, you weren't
supposed to--

00:11:44.333 --> 00:11:46.000
in some societies--

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.800
cut up bodies for autopsies.

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:52.633
We all know things like the
circulation of the blood, the

00:11:52.633 --> 00:11:56.067
role the heart in that were not
properly understood for

00:11:56.067 --> 00:11:58.333
many centuries later.

00:11:58.333 --> 00:12:03.200
But this is the most elaborate
and successful model of

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:05.867
medicine and practice of
medicine in the civilized

00:12:05.867 --> 00:12:08.367
world at this time.

00:12:08.367 --> 00:12:10.367
So this is a splendid
civilization.

00:12:10.367 --> 00:12:14.433
I hope I've given you some
slight indication of that.

00:12:14.433 --> 00:12:16.100
Why does it collapse?

00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:17.733
This is partly a question
of why does any

00:12:17.733 --> 00:12:20.733
civilization collapse.

00:12:20.733 --> 00:12:24.633
Time tends to ruin everything.

00:12:24.633 --> 00:12:32.133
The Abbasids were victims of the
same divisive tendencies

00:12:32.133 --> 00:12:35.667
we've already seen at work
within the Islamic world right

00:12:35.667 --> 00:12:37.033
from the beginning.

00:12:37.033 --> 00:12:43.533
Religious strife, particularly
but not exclusively the

00:12:43.533 --> 00:12:47.000
Sunni/Shi'ite division.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.200
Dynastic, that is to say,
internal or familial problems.

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:53.433
Resentment at taxation.

00:12:56.267 --> 00:13:01.267
In the beginning, as we said,
the Islamic conquerors taxed

00:13:01.267 --> 00:13:03.600
rather lightly.

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:09.800
But as the ability to rely on
confiscated estates of nobles,

00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:13.633
the Church and the state
faded as the

00:13:13.633 --> 00:13:15.900
Abbasids became the state.

00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:19.133
Like all states, they started
to run out of money.

00:13:19.133 --> 00:13:22.767
They had a large army, they had
a large court, they had a

00:13:22.767 --> 00:13:25.433
large administrative structure
to maintain.

00:13:25.433 --> 00:13:30.467
And then, as now, people tend,
rightly or wrongly, not to

00:13:30.467 --> 00:13:33.600
appreciate the role of
government in everything, and

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:37.533
to be resentful of having
to pay for it.

00:13:37.533 --> 00:13:40.133
The fundamental problem, as
Wickham points out, is that

00:13:40.133 --> 00:13:41.600
the Empire was too big.

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:45.767
And here, we're back where we
started with the Roman Empire.

00:13:45.767 --> 00:13:48.700
Empires tend to fall because
they are too big.

00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:52.100
And being too big they
tend to overreach.

00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:54.567
In other words, they're already
big and they try, if

00:13:54.567 --> 00:13:59.500
not to get bigger, at least
to deal with more enemies.

00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:02.833
Because as you get bigger you
develop more enemies.

00:14:02.833 --> 00:14:05.333
And as you get bigger you
also develop more

00:14:05.333 --> 00:14:07.600
fears of external enemies.

00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:15.700
So to say that the Empire was
too big is not to say anything

00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:20.400
very innovative or unusual.

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:24.933
The real question is why does
there come a point at which

00:14:24.933 --> 00:14:27.967
this bigness is fatal?

00:14:27.967 --> 00:14:31.667
In other words, the Abbasid
Caliphate does fine from 750

00:14:31.667 --> 00:14:37.300
to 910 and then it
falls apart.

00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:39.967
Why does it fall apart
when it does?

00:14:42.933 --> 00:14:45.367
And I don't have a great answer
for that, except to

00:14:45.367 --> 00:14:52.533
point to the other divisions, or
to misfortune: having poor

00:14:52.533 --> 00:14:55.533
Caliphs, having Caliphs who
don't last for a long time and

00:14:55.533 --> 00:14:56.900
are overthrown.

00:14:56.900 --> 00:15:03.033
Nevertheless, states start to
split off from the Caliphate.

00:15:03.033 --> 00:15:08.233
The first, right from the
beginning, is Umayyad Spain.

00:15:08.233 --> 00:15:12.233
And Wickham talks a little bit
about the civilization of

00:15:12.233 --> 00:15:14.367
Umayyad Spain.

00:15:14.367 --> 00:15:18.500
But you start to have the
splitting of places like

00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:24.600
Egypt, under the Shi'ite Dynasty
the Fatimids by the

00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:25.833
tenth century.

00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:33.633
What's interesting is that these
societies are run very

00:15:33.633 --> 00:15:35.467
much like the Abbasid
Caliphate.

00:15:35.467 --> 00:15:40.033
Although they are large, they
are more practical, compact,

00:15:40.033 --> 00:15:42.033
and somewhat easier
to hold together.

00:15:42.033 --> 00:15:45.567
They have the same kind of
cultural efflorescence,

00:15:45.567 --> 00:15:50.867
scientific curiosity,
sensuality of

00:15:50.867 --> 00:15:54.800
culture, luxury products.

00:15:54.800 --> 00:16:00.333
Indeed, Umayyad Spain would
have the reputation of the

00:16:00.333 --> 00:16:04.000
height of civilization
in Christian Europe

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.733
of the tenth century.

00:16:06.733 --> 00:16:12.900
A nun writing from a German
monastery in the tenth century

00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:28.267
named Hroswitha, Hroswitha
of Gandersheim, describes

00:16:28.267 --> 00:16:32.000
Cordoba, capital of
Umayyad Spain, the

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.067
largest city in Europe--

00:16:35.067 --> 00:16:38.200
excluding Constantinople, the
largest city in Western Europe

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:39.167
at this time--

00:16:39.167 --> 00:16:42.900
she describes Cordoba as "the
ornament of the world".

00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:45.267
She had never visited it.

00:16:45.267 --> 00:16:48.967
She's a cloistered nun in
a monastery in Germany.

00:16:48.967 --> 00:16:52.233
Nevertheless, for her this
is the most splendid

00:16:52.233 --> 00:16:54.467
place in the world.

00:16:54.467 --> 00:16:59.967
Splendid in terms of wealth,
population, culture, learning.

00:16:59.967 --> 00:17:02.767
And Ornament of the World is
the title of a book by our

00:17:02.767 --> 00:17:06.633
colleague in the Spanish
department, Maria Menocal,

00:17:06.633 --> 00:17:11.300
written about ten years ago,
describing medieval Spain and

00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:15.767
its civilization.

00:17:15.767 --> 00:17:21.033
Cordoba would be a center for
learning among Christians,

00:17:21.033 --> 00:17:25.233
Jews, and Muslims.

00:17:25.233 --> 00:17:29.467
So this series of cultural
accomplishments by the Arabs,

00:17:29.467 --> 00:17:36.167
as I said, may come
as a surprise, but

00:17:36.167 --> 00:17:38.433
it should not be.

00:17:38.433 --> 00:17:42.267
The surprise element may be,
as we've said now more than

00:17:42.267 --> 00:17:46.267
once, the ability of the Arabs
to assimilate other traditions

00:17:46.267 --> 00:17:48.700
and to remain as conquerors.

00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:51.367
That is, these two things
are related.

00:17:51.367 --> 00:17:53.800
They remain as conquerors
even though the

00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:57.900
Caliphate does not survive.

00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:07.200
The Arabs are still the dominant
force in Egypt, North

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:12.067
Africa, and much of the Middle
East. And where they are not

00:18:12.067 --> 00:18:17.567
dominant, Islam remains the
dominant faith of places like

00:18:17.567 --> 00:18:21.933
Persia, modern Iran,
and further east.

00:18:21.933 --> 00:18:26.900
So just because the Caliphate
falls does not mean that Islam

00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:31.500
loses power and it doesn't mean
that the civilization of

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:33.400
Islam fails.

00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:36.933
At least not at this point.

00:18:36.933 --> 00:18:40.733
I hope then we can see that
Islam is a thing in itself, a

00:18:40.733 --> 00:18:44.533
historical force in itself,
developed in our period, but

00:18:44.533 --> 00:18:48.167
also to some extent an heir
to the Roman Empire.

00:18:48.167 --> 00:18:50.533
Remember I said that there
are three heirs

00:18:50.533 --> 00:18:52.667
to the Roman Empire--

00:18:52.667 --> 00:18:56.933
the Byzantine or Eastern Roman
Empire, most obviously the

00:18:56.933 --> 00:18:58.233
Western kingdoms--

00:18:58.233 --> 00:19:00.367
and when we come to Charlemagne
next week we'll be

00:19:00.367 --> 00:19:02.933
talking about this much
more aggressively--

00:19:02.933 --> 00:19:08.333
and the Islamic world.

00:19:08.333 --> 00:19:10.967
It's also, however, the heir
to some other cultures.

00:19:10.967 --> 00:19:14.600
It's the heir to Sassanian or
Persian culture, for example.

00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:17.900
So it is not exclusively to be
understood as a successor to

00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:23.200
the Roman Empire, but then
again, neither is the west of

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:25.500
Europe and there is Byzantium.

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:28.000
And those are the things that
we're going to be discussing

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.800
in the future.

00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:34.833
So any observations thus far,
or problems thus far?

00:19:34.833 --> 00:19:38.067
The Islamic world, these three
lectures clear is as can be?

00:19:38.067 --> 00:19:41.933
Imprinted in your mind like
the Seal of the Prophets?

00:19:41.933 --> 00:19:43.167
OK.

00:19:43.167 --> 00:19:46.000
So what about the
seventh century?

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.333
Now we're backtracking
a little.

00:19:47.333 --> 00:19:49.567
Because with the Abbasids
we'd gotten up as far

00:19:49.567 --> 00:19:52.267
as the tenth century.

00:19:54.933 --> 00:19:56.567
I want to go back to the seventh
century because it's

00:19:56.567 --> 00:19:59.033
the crucial turning point of
the early Middle Ages.

00:19:59.033 --> 00:20:00.800
Even though we're in the tenth
week of this course--

00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:02.600
is that right?--

00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:05.567
here we are at its
hinge, I think.

00:20:05.567 --> 00:20:09.667
Or at least we can get
the lay of the land.

00:20:09.667 --> 00:20:12.467
This is a little bit like
approaching a shoreline which

00:20:12.467 --> 00:20:16.300
you see very vaguely, and then
suddenly actually you can

00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:19.133
start to see the houses and see
which are the mountains

00:20:19.133 --> 00:20:21.600
that are far way, and which are
the hills that are in the

00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:24.933
harbor, and so forth
and so on.

00:20:24.933 --> 00:20:27.267
So I hope that--I mean, the
course differs from many other

00:20:27.267 --> 00:20:31.833
history courses in that beyond
just the fall of the Roman

00:20:31.833 --> 00:20:35.533
Empire, you don't have an
instinctive feel for what this

00:20:35.533 --> 00:20:39.067
course is about, what
its contours are.

00:20:39.067 --> 00:20:45.933
So what I'm trying to do is not
just point to a turning in

00:20:45.933 --> 00:20:49.967
the road, but I'm trying to
show you the road itself

00:20:49.967 --> 00:20:52.833
through the proverbial
forest and the trees.

00:20:52.833 --> 00:20:54.100
OK?

00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:59.600
Partly what we're concerned
with is periodization.

00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:01.400
Now what are the time periods?

00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:04.067
Is the classical world and
then the medieval world?

00:21:04.067 --> 00:21:06.833
Is it something called the
classical world on

00:21:06.833 --> 00:21:09.333
intermediate period called Late
Antiquity and then the

00:21:09.333 --> 00:21:10.567
Middle Ages?

00:21:10.567 --> 00:21:13.767
What does the course title, "The
Early Middle Ages," mean

00:21:13.767 --> 00:21:17.400
when its successor is called
"The Birth of Europe"?

00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:20.700
We're going to change that, by
the way, maybe we're going to

00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:25.033
combine these into one course
called the Middle Ages, but

00:21:25.033 --> 00:21:26.267
that's for the future.

00:21:29.533 --> 00:21:30.700
So periodization.

00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:34.400
And then when are we talking
about as the

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:36.200
borders of these periods?

00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:42.333
It's a murky period that
covered by this course,

00:21:42.333 --> 00:21:48.267
roughly 284 to 1000 or
Diocletian to the year 1000.

00:21:48.267 --> 00:21:52.167
Murky but important, as I
hope you see already.

00:21:52.167 --> 00:21:55.067
The development of such
absolutely fundamental world

00:21:55.067 --> 00:22:00.133
historic things as
state-sponsored Christianity,

00:22:00.133 --> 00:22:07.067
Islam, the ideas of political
power in Europe as nations as

00:22:07.067 --> 00:22:10.933
opposed to the universal
Roman Empire.

00:22:10.933 --> 00:22:13.733
All of these things take
shape in our period.

00:22:17.067 --> 00:22:23.100
The traditional periodization
concentrated on the fall of

00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:24.333
the Roman Empire.

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:29.567
And while everybody admitted
this was somewhat of an

00:22:29.567 --> 00:22:34.000
arbitrary date, and indeed its
origins and consequences in

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:38.167
Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the
Roman Empire extend to the

00:22:38.167 --> 00:22:41.900
second century AD and go on to
the fall of Constantinople in

00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:45.833
the fifteenth century,
nevertheless, 476, the

00:22:45.833 --> 00:22:50.433
deposition of the last Roman
emperor ruling from Ravenna by

00:22:50.433 --> 00:22:54.067
the barbarian chieftain Odoacer,
who then proclaims

00:22:54.067 --> 00:22:57.967
Italy to be part of the Eastern
Roman Empire, or at

00:22:57.967 --> 00:23:01.133
least loyal to the Eastern Roman
Empire, that loyalty

00:23:01.133 --> 00:23:02.367
largely a fiction.

00:23:08.933 --> 00:23:12.600
In the traditional periodization
476 is then

00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:16.167
followed by something called
the Dark Ages.

00:23:16.167 --> 00:23:18.967
And the Dark Ages end, depending
on your point of

00:23:18.967 --> 00:23:23.467
view, with the growth of the
European economy in the tenth

00:23:23.467 --> 00:23:29.467
or eleventh century, with the
rediscovery of Latin classical

00:23:29.467 --> 00:23:33.000
culture in the twelfth century,
or with the Italian

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.700
Renaissance in the fifteenth
century.

00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:40.867
Certainly, the Renaissance
artists regarded everything

00:23:40.867 --> 00:23:43.900
that came before them
as the Dark Ages.

00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:47.133
And it is they who call
medieval architecture

00:23:47.133 --> 00:23:51.700
"Gothic", by which they don't
mean a complimentary term.

00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:55.067
Because if there's one thing the
Cathedral of Notre Dame in

00:23:55.067 --> 00:23:58.667
Paris is not, it's not Gothic
in the literal sense.

00:23:58.667 --> 00:24:02.700
It has nothing to do with the
Visigoths or the Ostrogoths.

00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:06.767
We have a few little remnants of
Visigothic and Ostrogothic

00:24:06.767 --> 00:24:09.233
architecture, and it's
not like that at all.

00:24:09.233 --> 00:24:11.633
But for Vasari and people
like this--

00:24:11.633 --> 00:24:13.067
Italian Renaissance writers--

00:24:13.067 --> 00:24:14.333
all this was just junk.

00:24:14.333 --> 00:24:18.000
It was just junk of the past.
It's just the Dark Ages.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:25.800
The sun rose in Florence
sometime after Dante, is what

00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:27.833
most people continue
to believe.

00:24:27.833 --> 00:24:32.233
And as a medievalist I long ago
gave up fighting this and

00:24:32.233 --> 00:24:33.100
embraced it.

00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:34.433
The Dark Ages are cool.

00:24:34.433 --> 00:24:40.100
I know Halloween is over but,
nevertheless, we all know that

00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:44.133
the Middle Ages is far more
fun than the Renaissance.

00:24:44.133 --> 00:24:48.700
Who wants proportion and logic
and severe classical lines,

00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:51.833
when you can have gargoyles
and weird stuff?

00:24:51.833 --> 00:24:53.400
I'm preaching to the
converted, right?

00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:55.233
You're in this class.

00:24:55.233 --> 00:25:02.733
If you didn't like weirdness,
you'd be taking well, what

00:25:02.733 --> 00:25:03.867
would you be taking?

00:25:03.867 --> 00:25:06.300
I think I'll just leave that.

00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:10.533
We're not in competition
in this department.

00:25:10.533 --> 00:25:14.500
So I'm trying to argue that this
period is more than just

00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:19.933
a long nap for people just
waiting for something like the

00:25:19.933 --> 00:25:21.033
Italian Renaissance.

00:25:21.033 --> 00:25:24.133
There is this book that is
on the cutting edge of

00:25:24.133 --> 00:25:27.333
scholarship of this period
that is called The Long

00:25:27.333 --> 00:25:32.200
Morning of the Early Middle
Ages, which I think is not a

00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:34.800
felicitous title, much as I
admire the people who put this

00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:38.500
together who are at another
university not all that

00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:39.733
different from this one.

00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:44.733
By "long morning" they
don't mean brunch.

00:25:44.733 --> 00:25:48.033
That's what I would have called
it, The Long Brunch of

00:25:48.033 --> 00:25:49.600
the Early Middle Ages.

00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:53.700
People enjoying eggs Benedict on
the smoldering ruins of the

00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:55.833
Roman Empire-- eggs
Benedict, right?

00:25:59.933 --> 00:26:01.900
The Benedictine Rule.

00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:15.500
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:16.500
OK.

00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:17.000
OK.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:27.700
So we've seen that 476 is not
a cataclysmic turning point.

00:26:38.467 --> 00:26:38.700
OK.

00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:41.533
It's not a cataclysmic turning
point because, first of all,

00:26:41.533 --> 00:26:44.467
the Roman Empire survives in
the East as we've said.

00:26:44.467 --> 00:26:57.467
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:57.467 --> 00:27:00.233
So I think we should turn this
off for just a minute or two

00:27:00.233 --> 00:27:03.000
if you don't mind.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.467
Why the seventh century,
seriously?

00:27:05.467 --> 00:27:08.800
It is a better claim to the
status as pivot for this

00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:12.167
roughly 700 year period
than 476.

00:27:12.167 --> 00:27:15.233
It is in some sense the end
of the classical world.

00:27:15.233 --> 00:27:19.933
It is in some sense the end of
whatever we want to call this,

00:27:19.933 --> 00:27:22.900
Late Antiquity.

00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:27.300
This is for basically
four reasons.

00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:31.667
One, and the most obvious,
is the rise of Islam.

00:27:31.667 --> 00:27:34.333
The rise of Islam and
its consequences.

00:27:34.333 --> 00:27:36.000
The breaking apart of
the Mediterranean

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.867
into different regions.

00:27:38.867 --> 00:27:43.800
Although I've stressed the ties
between Islam, Greece,

00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:46.767
Persia, between the northern
and the southern

00:27:46.767 --> 00:27:50.433
Mediterranean, between Islamic
Spain and Christian Spain,

00:27:50.433 --> 00:27:53.867
nevertheless, the conquest of
the Arabs in the seventh

00:27:53.867 --> 00:27:57.900
century and the early eighth
century create somewhat of a

00:27:57.900 --> 00:28:00.133
break up of what had
been a united

00:28:00.133 --> 00:28:02.733
Mediterranean under the Romans.

00:28:02.733 --> 00:28:06.600
They're different religious,
cultural, and trades zones.

00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:12.500
Under the Romans, North Africa
and Italy had been really very

00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:13.400
close together.

00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:17.100
Had much more in common with
each other than say Italy and

00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:21.333
Northern Gaul or Britain.

00:28:21.333 --> 00:28:26.433
Augustine sails between North
Africa and Italy all the time.

00:28:26.433 --> 00:28:27.467
They're quite close.

00:28:27.467 --> 00:28:30.533
But we think of them as being
far away because in the modern

00:28:30.533 --> 00:28:34.567
world, and indeed since the
Islamic conquests, they've

00:28:34.567 --> 00:28:37.500
been culturally and economically
very different.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:45.933
So this breaking up of the
Mediterranean creates--

00:28:45.933 --> 00:28:48.133
and I'll elaborate on
this in a moment--

00:28:50.633 --> 00:28:53.867
doesn't create the birth of
Europe exactly, but it creates

00:28:53.867 --> 00:28:57.900
Europe as a kind of
separate region.

00:28:57.900 --> 00:29:00.400
Naturally, from the geographical
point of view,

00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:05.033
Europe has always existed
as a continent.

00:29:05.033 --> 00:29:08.600
But here we have the beginning
of the distinction between

00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:15.100
Europe and Asia and Africa
without the kinds of close

00:29:15.100 --> 00:29:19.300
ties that we've seen connected
the Mediterranean, the two

00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:21.600
shores of the Mediterranean,
which mainly because they're

00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:25.700
different continents and,
indeed, the third shore of the

00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:28.400
Mediterranean in the East,
technically in Asia.

00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:31.767
Now these start to fall into
different cultural and

00:29:31.767 --> 00:29:34.233
political realms.

00:29:34.233 --> 00:29:39.200
So the first aspect of the
seventh century is this

00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:43.067
breakup of Mediterranean unity,
the breakup of this

00:29:43.067 --> 00:29:45.033
aspect of the Roman legacy.

00:29:45.033 --> 00:29:47.400
And if I've emphasized that
there are three heirs to the

00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:50.500
Roman Empire, the fact that
there are three heirs to one

00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:54.667
fortune shows that they
are distinct.

00:29:54.667 --> 00:29:57.667
Second, and related to this, the
rise of Northern Europe.

00:29:57.667 --> 00:30:00.600
What had been peripheral in
the Roman Empire starts to

00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:02.500
become much more central.

00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:05.567
And when we come to Charlemagne
you'll see this.

00:30:05.567 --> 00:30:07.433
Around 800--

00:30:07.433 --> 00:30:08.967
well, 800 exactly--

00:30:08.967 --> 00:30:12.667
is the year in which Charlemagne
is crowned Roman

00:30:12.667 --> 00:30:18.733
emperor in Rome itself by the
Pope as it turns out.

00:30:18.733 --> 00:30:25.267
But already, this importance of
Northern Europe is evident

00:30:25.267 --> 00:30:27.033
in some things we've
been talking about.

00:30:27.033 --> 00:30:29.433
The Irish missionaries,
for example.

00:30:29.433 --> 00:30:32.767
The role of Ireland in
preserving knowledge and in

00:30:32.767 --> 00:30:34.400
diffusing Christianity.

00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:36.067
The role of Britain.

00:30:36.067 --> 00:30:39.867
The fact that, as I said,
Britain at the time of Bede,

00:30:39.867 --> 00:30:45.900
was the most cultivated heir to
the Latin learning of the

00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:47.167
Roman Empire.

00:30:50.533 --> 00:30:57.500
And the fact that this should be
true in the eighth century

00:30:57.500 --> 00:31:01.733
shows some kind of difference,
some kind of change, since in

00:31:01.733 --> 00:31:04.200
the Roman Empire these had
been peripheral areas.

00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:06.467
The further north you went,
the further away from the

00:31:06.467 --> 00:31:12.467
Mediterranean, the less
civilized the society was.

00:31:12.467 --> 00:31:16.467
The third aspect of this turning
point, a third way in

00:31:16.467 --> 00:31:24.267
which we have a kind of shift,
is the crisis and reshaping of

00:31:24.267 --> 00:31:26.933
the Byzantine Empire.

00:31:26.933 --> 00:31:30.867
The loss of Egypt to North
Africa, Palestine, and Syria,

00:31:30.867 --> 00:31:34.233
which take place in the
seventh century.

00:31:34.233 --> 00:31:37.133
And we'll talk about this
more next week.

00:31:37.133 --> 00:31:40.467
But the decline of the cities
of the Byzantine Empire, the

00:31:40.467 --> 00:31:43.533
militarization of society
in the Byzantine Empire.

00:31:43.533 --> 00:31:47.867
In fact, the seventh century
is the era of the Byzantine

00:31:47.867 --> 00:31:52.333
Empire that most resembles the
fifth century for the Western

00:31:52.333 --> 00:31:54.933
Roman Empire.

00:31:54.933 --> 00:32:02.700
If we preserve the term "Dark
Ages" reluctantly, the West

00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:05.967
goes into a period of what
Wickham calls "radical

00:32:05.967 --> 00:32:09.533
simplification of material
culture." That is to say

00:32:09.533 --> 00:32:12.600
people become poorer
and less in contact

00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:13.767
with the wider world.

00:32:13.767 --> 00:32:17.333
And this happens in Byzantium
in the seventh century.

00:32:17.333 --> 00:32:21.300
So it's not that the Eastern
empire survives completely

00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:25.867
intact, but that its collapse
is later than that of the

00:32:25.867 --> 00:32:26.567
Western empire.

00:32:26.567 --> 00:32:29.233
But crucially, again as
we will see, that

00:32:29.233 --> 00:32:30.467
collapse is not total.

00:32:30.467 --> 00:32:35.100
It's not as complete as that
of the West. The Byzantine

00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:39.267
Empire would just barely survive
the seventh and eighth

00:32:39.267 --> 00:32:43.867
centuries, and by the ninth
century enter into a period of

00:32:43.867 --> 00:32:48.267
efflorescence that we
will be describing.

00:32:48.267 --> 00:32:54.267
But this society is not really
Roman anymore on some

00:32:54.267 --> 00:32:56.500
fundamental level--

00:32:56.500 --> 00:33:00.667
fundamental level including
control of Rome and Italy.

00:33:03.267 --> 00:33:07.033
The basis of the Byzantine
Empire will be Anatolia, that

00:33:07.033 --> 00:33:13.567
is Asiatic Turkey and the
Balkans, modern Romania,

00:33:13.567 --> 00:33:19.467
Bulgaria, Greece, Albania,
Croatia, Serbia, and so forth.

00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:39.367
Constans II, Byzantine emperor
from 652 to 668, leaves

00:33:39.367 --> 00:33:48.267
Constantinople after the first
Muslim siege intent on

00:33:48.267 --> 00:33:51.100
creating a new capital in the
West because Constantinople is

00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:52.333
too vulnerable.

00:33:52.333 --> 00:33:56.233
In other words, he envisages a
Eastern Roman Empire, but with

00:33:56.233 --> 00:33:59.267
its capital in Sicily.

00:33:59.267 --> 00:34:02.400
He moves his capital eventually
to Syracuse,

00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:05.100
Siracusa in modern Sicily.

00:34:07.767 --> 00:34:10.567
He's the last emperor
to visit Rome.

00:34:10.567 --> 00:34:14.900
Well, the last eastern Roman
emperor actually to put in an

00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:17.333
appearance in Rome.

00:34:17.333 --> 00:34:20.000
As I've said, these emperors
would call themselves the

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:24.433
Roman emperor until the day the
Turks penetrated the walls

00:34:24.433 --> 00:34:29.767
of Constantinople in 1453.

00:34:29.767 --> 00:34:33.033
But they weren't really emperors
of Rome in the sense

00:34:33.033 --> 00:34:40.000
of control over the city of Rome
after 664, the last visit

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.067
of an emperor to Rome.

00:34:42.067 --> 00:34:44.933
And then four years later he
was murdered in Syracuse.

00:34:44.933 --> 00:34:47.033
Well, the fact that the emperor
is murdered is not all

00:34:47.033 --> 00:34:49.433
that unusual.

00:34:49.433 --> 00:34:53.100
A lot of these emperors get
murdered, get their noses cut

00:34:53.100 --> 00:34:54.333
off in lieu of murder.

00:34:54.333 --> 00:34:56.567
The notion being that if you're
mutilated you can't be

00:34:56.567 --> 00:34:57.967
an emperor again.

00:34:57.967 --> 00:35:00.367
And then one of these
emperors as we'll--

00:35:00.367 --> 00:35:02.200
again, we'll discuss this--

00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:04.367
comes back even though
his nose is gone.

00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:11.000
But what this means is the end
of this experiment in moving

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:12.567
the seat of the Empire.

00:35:12.567 --> 00:35:14.300
It moves back to
Constantinople.

00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:18.400
And Constantinople, for better
or worse-- and surprisingly, a

00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:19.800
lot for better--

00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:26.567
remains the capital of this
powerful, if limited, empire.

00:35:26.567 --> 00:35:30.233
The seventh century, however,
should not be seen as a time

00:35:30.233 --> 00:35:33.733
when these realms
are completely

00:35:33.733 --> 00:35:36.300
isolated from each other.

00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:39.233
The Islamic, the Eastern,
the Western.

00:35:39.233 --> 00:35:42.667
It is still possible
to travel.

00:35:42.667 --> 00:35:45.600
And, indeed, Brown
emphasizes this.

00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:51.300
The archbishop of Canterbury
in the end of the seventh

00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:58.400
century, Theodore, came from
Tarsus in Anatolia, Syria.

00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:02.033
Many of the popes of
this era were of

00:36:02.033 --> 00:36:04.267
Syriac or Greek origin.

00:36:09.333 --> 00:36:15.567
This starts to fade, however,
as Islam takes control over

00:36:15.567 --> 00:36:19.467
more and more of the former
Eastern Roman Empire.

00:36:19.467 --> 00:36:24.533
So not only do you get a
diminution in communication

00:36:24.533 --> 00:36:30.967
and cultural exchange between
the Islamic world now as it is

00:36:30.967 --> 00:36:33.200
and the Christian world, you
get less between East and

00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:37.667
West. In the West people no
longer tend to know Greek

00:36:37.667 --> 00:36:40.333
outside of Rome and
the papacy.

00:36:40.333 --> 00:36:44.000
And by the eighth century, even
in Rome, this knowledge

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:45.567
is much, much diminished.

00:36:50.567 --> 00:36:54.000
And then the reorientation
of Persia.

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:56.433
It's no accident that Brown
begins the chapter that you've

00:36:56.433 --> 00:36:59.100
read with a discussion
of Persia.

00:36:59.100 --> 00:37:02.433
And, actually, we hear more
about Persia now in this

00:37:02.433 --> 00:37:06.333
reading than in any other single
reading for the course.

00:37:06.333 --> 00:37:11.100
And this is not just because of
the Islamic conquest. Part

00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:15.233
of it is Persia's, modern
Iran's position.

00:37:15.233 --> 00:37:18.000
It's modern Iran, but it's
also modern Iraq.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:21.700
The capital of Persia is in what
is now Iraq, in the more

00:37:21.700 --> 00:37:26.100
fertile part of the former
Persian empire, that is to say

00:37:26.100 --> 00:37:29.200
the West, what is known in the
ancient world as Mesopotamia.

00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:35.233
So Persia could be oriented
towards Mesopotamia or could

00:37:35.233 --> 00:37:38.200
be oriented more towards
the East, towards India

00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:40.233
ultimately.

00:37:40.233 --> 00:37:43.567
And this is partly for
extraneous reasons.

00:37:43.567 --> 00:37:47.767
The rise of these people called
the White Huns who

00:37:47.767 --> 00:37:54.900
press Persia from the East and
take over modern Afghanistan

00:37:54.900 --> 00:37:57.400
and even what's now
Eastern Iran.

00:38:00.967 --> 00:38:04.567
Persia has been a kind of off
stage presence in this course.

00:38:07.267 --> 00:38:11.733
But in terms of trade, there
had been a great deal of

00:38:11.733 --> 00:38:12.600
interaction.

00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:13.667
Trade and culture.

00:38:13.667 --> 00:38:15.833
The Silk Road.

00:38:15.833 --> 00:38:18.267
Traffic in spices.

00:38:18.267 --> 00:38:20.200
There have been a tremendous
traffic in

00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:22.667
religious ideas, as well.

00:38:22.667 --> 00:38:28.067
Nestorianism becomes strong in
Persia, the heresy of the

00:38:28.067 --> 00:38:29.233
fifth century.

00:38:31.767 --> 00:38:34.200
Manicheanism, which we discussed
in relation to

00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:37.400
Augustine comes from Persia.

00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:41.167
A lot of apocalyptic thinking
in both Islam and in

00:38:41.167 --> 00:38:42.200
Christianity.

00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:45.933
The focus on the end of the
world and what God has planned

00:38:45.933 --> 00:38:48.700
for sinners and for the
justified, comes

00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:51.400
from Persia, as well.

00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:55.167
Now, however, in the seventh
century and the eighth century

00:38:55.167 --> 00:38:58.233
start to see a hardening
of the boundaries.

00:38:58.233 --> 00:39:03.133
Western Europe is less in
contact with the East. It's

00:39:03.133 --> 00:39:07.133
less in contact with Byzantium,
with which it has

00:39:07.133 --> 00:39:09.167
religious disputes.

00:39:09.167 --> 00:39:13.367
And it is out of contact with
these influences coming from

00:39:13.367 --> 00:39:17.100
the East from as far as Persia,
that characterized the

00:39:17.100 --> 00:39:20.167
period that we began
with and up to now.

00:39:24.767 --> 00:39:29.000
And this is reflected in the
changing of the center of

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:32.233
gravity of the Caliphate that
we alluded to last time.

00:39:32.233 --> 00:39:35.800
The move from Damascus to
Baghdad is not only a

00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:39.600
strategic decision or a cultural
decision, but it's a

00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:43.433
de-Mediterraneanizing
of Islam.

00:39:43.433 --> 00:39:47.700
Its capital is now within the
former Persian Empire.

00:39:47.700 --> 00:39:49.367
And if it doesn't mean a
Persianization of the

00:39:49.367 --> 00:39:53.900
Caliphate, it certainly means
that Islam is not really a

00:39:53.900 --> 00:39:56.367
Mediterranean religion and
certainly not exclusively.

00:39:59.667 --> 00:40:06.667
And then, finally, in the West
the seventh century sees the

00:40:06.667 --> 00:40:09.333
end of a secular elite.

00:40:09.333 --> 00:40:12.433
When we began this course we
talked about the Roman Empire

00:40:12.433 --> 00:40:17.867
as characterized by a civilian
or senatorial elite of wealthy

00:40:17.867 --> 00:40:23.800
people of cultivation, who are
not only literate but who are

00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:27.000
scholarly and artistically
inclined.

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:29.600
These people are gone by
the seventh century.

00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:34.567
In their place is a smaller and
somewhat different elite,

00:40:34.567 --> 00:40:39.600
at least elite understood
by learning, of clergy.

00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:42.233
It's at this point that
monasteries and churches

00:40:42.233 --> 00:40:46.433
become the repository of the
classical legacy and are run

00:40:46.433 --> 00:40:50.833
by the almost sole literate
people in society.

00:40:56.633 --> 00:41:03.400
So how do we put these
things together,

00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:05.733
these phenomena together?

00:41:05.733 --> 00:41:08.733
One way of doing this that
was very popular in the

00:41:08.733 --> 00:41:12.967
mid-twentieth century was what
was known as the "Pirenne

00:41:12.967 --> 00:41:17.067
thesis", named after the great
Belgian historian Henri

00:41:17.067 --> 00:41:24.167
Pirenne, who was active in the
teens, twenties of the

00:41:24.167 --> 00:41:24.967
twentieth century.

00:41:24.967 --> 00:41:27.133
Henri Pirenne, the
Pirenne thesis.

00:41:27.133 --> 00:41:32.500
And the Pirenne thesis
goes like this:

00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:34.967
The Roman Empire did
not fall in 476.

00:41:34.967 --> 00:41:39.367
It continued, if not as a
political entity, as a

00:41:39.367 --> 00:41:43.667
sociocultural and most
especially, economic entity.

00:41:43.667 --> 00:41:46.700
Because the Mediterranean and
Mediterranean unity were what

00:41:46.700 --> 00:41:49.967
characterized the Roman Empire
from the start, and this was

00:41:49.967 --> 00:41:53.333
not disrupted by
the barbarians.

00:41:53.333 --> 00:41:56.100
Mediterranean trade continued
to exist. Gold coinage

00:41:56.100 --> 00:41:57.300
continued to exist.

00:41:57.300 --> 00:42:00.367
What ended them was not the
collapse of the Empire in the

00:42:00.367 --> 00:42:02.667
West, but Islam.

00:42:02.667 --> 00:42:07.700
That the Arab invasions cut off
the different pieces of

00:42:07.700 --> 00:42:11.967
the Mediterranean and ended
Mediterranean trade.

00:42:11.967 --> 00:42:15.833
And with the end of the
Mediterranean as this key

00:42:15.833 --> 00:42:21.533
entrepot, or economic heartland,
new centers were

00:42:21.533 --> 00:42:24.867
created, particularly
Northern Europe.

00:42:24.867 --> 00:42:29.200
The rise of Northern Europe that
I mentioned here was most

00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:32.533
obvious in the ascent
of Charlemagne.

00:42:32.533 --> 00:42:37.467
Charlemagne, crowned emperor
in Rome in 800, was by no

00:42:37.467 --> 00:42:44.700
means from Rome or Italy, but
was from the Frankish realm.

00:42:44.700 --> 00:42:49.600
The lands of his family were
in what is now Belgium,

00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:52.367
Western Germany, the
Netherlands, and

00:42:52.367 --> 00:42:54.900
Northeastern France.

00:42:54.900 --> 00:42:57.567
His capital was not Rome.

00:42:57.567 --> 00:42:59.333
He went there to be crowned.

00:42:59.333 --> 00:43:03.933
His capital was rather in
Aachen, a city that is in

00:43:03.933 --> 00:43:05.533
Germany but only barely.

00:43:05.533 --> 00:43:07.600
It's very close to
the Dutch border.

00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:09.933
Very close to Belgium,
as well.

00:43:09.933 --> 00:43:11.433
Very close to Luxembourg.

00:43:11.433 --> 00:43:14.000
And quite close to France.

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:17.933
He is a representative then
of Northern Europe.

00:43:17.933 --> 00:43:21.133
Aachen had been known to the
Romans because it has hot

00:43:21.133 --> 00:43:24.100
baths, and that's why
Charlemagne chose it also:

00:43:24.100 --> 00:43:26.267
natural hot springs.

00:43:26.267 --> 00:43:32.600
But it is not part of the olive
oil and wine-growing

00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:37.300
regions of the Mediterranean
that we saw were what the

00:43:37.300 --> 00:43:40.933
Romans loved, and what they
considered to be civilization.

00:43:40.933 --> 00:43:45.300
For Pirenne then, the rise of
Charlemagne is made possible

00:43:45.300 --> 00:43:46.433
by Mohammed.

00:43:46.433 --> 00:43:49.800
And, indeed, his master work
was called Mohammed and

00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:52.367
Charlemagne.

00:43:52.367 --> 00:43:56.167
Here, the periodization
is definitely Islam.

00:43:56.167 --> 00:44:01.233
Islam creates Europe because
Europe is the antithesis to

00:44:01.233 --> 00:44:03.667
the world created by Islam.

00:44:03.667 --> 00:44:06.200
Pirenne had no ideological
opposition to Islam.

00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:09.833
For him Islam is simply a
facilitating factor in

00:44:09.833 --> 00:44:11.567
destroying the ancient world.

00:44:11.567 --> 00:44:14.800
And by ancient world, he means
the Mediterranean.

00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:17.000
Well, this is one of those
elegant theories

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:18.933
that has been disproven.

00:44:18.933 --> 00:44:21.833
It's been disproven largely by
archaeology, which has shown

00:44:21.833 --> 00:44:23.967
that there's lots of trade
in the Mediterranean.

00:44:23.967 --> 00:44:28.100
That the arrival of Islam by no
means disrupted trade, by

00:44:28.100 --> 00:44:31.033
no means disrupted
these contacts.

00:44:31.033 --> 00:44:33.333
But it is true--

00:44:33.333 --> 00:44:36.967
and I've just said
or emphasized--

00:44:36.967 --> 00:44:39.567
that beginning with Islam,
beginning with the seventh

00:44:39.567 --> 00:44:43.100
century, there is a drifting
apart of cultural and

00:44:43.100 --> 00:44:47.233
political realms. We can start
to identify three different

00:44:47.233 --> 00:44:49.633
civilizations.

00:44:49.633 --> 00:44:53.133
And next week we're going to
talk about the flowering of

00:44:53.133 --> 00:44:57.633
Byzantium, that is the height
of this Eastern Roman Empire

00:44:57.633 --> 00:45:00.300
in terms of its political
military power.

00:45:00.300 --> 00:45:03.400
And then we're going to come to
Charlemagne and try to see

00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:08.367
what this landscape of the
development of something other

00:45:08.367 --> 00:45:11.433
than mere barbarian post-Roman
successor states

00:45:11.433 --> 00:45:13.667
means for the West. OK.

00:45:13.667 --> 00:45:14.600
It's been a lot of fun.

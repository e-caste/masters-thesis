00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:04.219
Professor John Rogers:
It's been said that if

00:00:04.219 --> 00:00:05.750
Samson Agonistes didn't
exist,

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:09.774
then we could say with
something like perfect

00:00:09.774 --> 00:00:14.988
confidence that John Milton
could never have chosen Samson

00:00:14.988 --> 00:00:18.367
for a hero.
There's very little in the

00:00:18.367 --> 00:00:23.000
Samson story that makes sense in
terms of the larger thematic

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.020
patterns of Milton's major poems
as we have come to know them.

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.895
Think about Paradise Lost.
In Paradise Lost,

00:00:30.895 --> 00:00:34.230
Milton struggled to justify
the ways of God to men.

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.390
He attempted to make his
religion, his faith,

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.772
as justifiable and as rational
in a lot of ways as he possibly

00:00:41.772 --> 00:00:45.436
could.In Paradise
Regained Milton rewrote

00:00:45.436 --> 00:00:48.431
Christian history.
He went even further,

00:00:48.431 --> 00:00:52.124
rewriting Christian history to
scrub it clean of the primitive

00:00:52.124 --> 00:00:56.120
and violent notion of sacrifice
in the form of the crucifixion.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.441
Fallen man was redeemed,
we remember,

00:00:58.441 --> 00:01:01.601
not because Christ was
sacrificed on the cross but

00:01:01.601 --> 00:01:05.276
because of a much more rational
and arguably a justifiable

00:01:05.276 --> 00:01:09.016
cause: man was redeemed quite
simply because the Son of God

00:01:09.016 --> 00:01:12.370
was able to resist the
temptations of Satan.

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:16.948
Man was redeemed because the
Son was able to behave

00:01:16.948 --> 00:01:22.625
rationally and obediently -- and
an unstated corollary here for

00:01:22.625 --> 00:01:27.019
Paradise Regained is that
we can all.

00:01:27.019 --> 00:01:29.917
We're all in a position to
redeem ourselves,

00:01:29.917 --> 00:01:33.893
and I think this is why Milton
so scrupulously and carefully

00:01:33.893 --> 00:01:37.060
refers to Jesus either as Jesus
or the Son,

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.027
the Son of God,
and never in Paradise

00:01:41.027 --> 00:01:45.632
Regained as Christ.
Of course, we can't aspire to

00:01:45.632 --> 00:01:49.046
the status of Christ,
which is the Greek word for

00:01:49.046 --> 00:01:51.748
messiah,
which merely means "the

00:01:51.748 --> 00:01:55.625
anointed one."
That's something that we can't

00:01:55.625 --> 00:01:59.920
be, but as Satan knows,
all of us are sons of God.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.295
We all have the capacity to do
pretty much what the Son of God

00:02:04.295 --> 00:02:08.240
had accomplished in Paradise
Regained.Now,

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.822
when we approach Samson
Agonistes, we realize

00:02:11.822 --> 00:02:15.282
pretty quickly that we have to
toss aside immediately any

00:02:15.282 --> 00:02:18.680
expectation that Milton will be
writing a theodicy,

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.990
an attempt to justify the ways
of God.

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:26.870
It's impossible to imagine the
justice or the rationality

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.280
behind the primary actions of
this poem.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.462
The first question that I think
we have to ask ourselves is what

00:02:35.462 --> 00:02:38.914
could possibly [laughs]
have possessed Milton to have

00:02:38.914 --> 00:02:42.343
chosen Samson,
that famous biblical hero,

00:02:42.343 --> 00:02:45.349
for the subject of his final
work.

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:49.267
I'm just going to ask you for a
moment to think about Samson as

00:02:49.267 --> 00:02:52.680
he appears in the Old Testament,
the book of Judges.

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.698
I think all biblical scholars
agree that the story of Samson

00:02:57.698 --> 00:03:02.886
had its origins in a primitive
and savage folk tale.Samson

00:03:02.886 --> 00:03:07.309
was a giant who slayed
Philistines with a jawbone and

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:12.413
who attached firebrands to the
tails of foxes in order to set

00:03:12.413 --> 00:03:15.981
whole cities on fire.
The writer of the Judges

00:03:15.981 --> 00:03:18.093
version of this tale -- which
comes much later,

00:03:18.093 --> 00:03:20.861
of course,
than the original tale itself,

00:03:20.861 --> 00:03:25.130
because it's a folk tale -- the
Judges version has done very

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:29.183
little to cleanse the tale of
what we can think of as its

00:03:29.183 --> 00:03:33.525
savagery or to transform the
tale into anything that we might

00:03:33.525 --> 00:03:36.710
think appropriate for holy
scripture.

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:39.958
If the Old Testament Samson can
be said to possess any virtues

00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:42.940
that we would feel comfortable
recognizing as virtues,

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:48.490
it would have to be Samson's
complete abstinence from wine.

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:53.482
It goes without saying that we
all applaud Samson's

00:03:53.482 --> 00:03:57.708
abstemiousness.
Surely this abstinence from

00:03:57.708 --> 00:04:03.234
wine isn't in and of itself a
sufficient cause for Milton to

00:04:03.234 --> 00:04:08.572
turn what is essentially a
terrorist ogre into an orthodox

00:04:08.572 --> 00:04:12.599
hero fit for a Christian
poem.Now,

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:14.740
look at the front of the
handout.

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:19.104
This is where I reproduced the
end of the Judges version of the

00:04:19.104 --> 00:04:22.393
Samson story,
and so according to the Hebrew

00:04:22.393 --> 00:04:25.967
Bible these are Samson's
climactic actions at the

00:04:25.967 --> 00:04:30.217
Philistine Festival of Dagon.
You'll remember that Samson has

00:04:30.217 --> 00:04:32.265
been blinded,
he's been humiliated,

00:04:32.265 --> 00:04:35.819
and he's being forced to make
sport for the Philistines;

00:04:35.819 --> 00:04:39.410
it's a side show for the main
show.

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:41.170
Samson called unto the Lord and
said:

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:43.754
O Lord God,
remember me,

00:04:43.754 --> 00:04:46.428
I pray thee,
and strengthen me,

00:04:46.428 --> 00:04:49.279
I pray thee,
only this once,

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:54.485
O God, that I may be at once
avenged of the Philistines for

00:04:54.485 --> 00:04:57.646
my two eyes.
And Samson took hold of

00:04:57.646 --> 00:05:00.050
the two middle pillars upon
which the house stood,

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:03.243
and on which it was borne up,
of the one with his right hand,

00:05:03.243 --> 00:05:05.319
and of the other with his
left.

00:05:05.319 --> 00:05:08.614
And Samson said,
Let me die with the

00:05:08.614 --> 00:05:11.392
Philistines.
And he bowed himself with all

00:05:11.392 --> 00:05:14.007
his might;
and the house fell upon the

00:05:14.007 --> 00:05:18.129
lords, and upon all the people
that were therein.

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:22.153
Now, Samson prays to God --
yes, it's true:

00:05:22.153 --> 00:05:26.560
he prays to God,
but look what he prays for.

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.689
He's praying for vengeance.
"Only this once…

00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:33.490
let me be avenged upon the
Philistines," Samson prays.

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:36.579
In an act that can only be
called a suicide,

00:05:36.579 --> 00:05:40.459
and it has been called a
suicide for thousands of years

00:05:40.459 --> 00:05:43.190
now, Samson brings the house
down.

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:47.059
The dominant impulses here are
suicide and revenge,

00:05:47.059 --> 00:05:51.471
and by any ethical standard
available to Milton this story

00:05:51.471 --> 00:05:56.269
has to be seen as morally and
ethically repugnant.Now,

00:05:56.269 --> 00:06:00.022
it's true that Milton does make
some efforts to clean the story

00:06:00.022 --> 00:06:03.593
up, to purge the story of some
of its most morally offensive

00:06:03.593 --> 00:06:06.012
elements.
I think that's perhaps one of

00:06:06.012 --> 00:06:09.110
the reasons why you have all of
that violent rhetoric,

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:12.444
that language of purgation,
that I talked about in the last

00:06:12.444 --> 00:06:14.100
lecture.
Nonetheless,

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:19.504
we simply can't deny the fact
that Samson does commit suicide

00:06:19.504 --> 00:06:24.817
and that the suicide has the
singularly satisfying effect of

00:06:24.817 --> 00:06:28.420
avenging the loss of Samson's
eyes.

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:32.154
What is so amazing about this
poem is that Samson's final

00:06:32.154 --> 00:06:35.889
action -- an action that any
right-thinking Christian,

00:06:35.889 --> 00:06:39.812
any right-thinking anyone,
would have to find ethically

00:06:39.812 --> 00:06:43.300
repellant -- this final action
is approved of.

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:48.214
It's sanctioned by God,
Samson's murderous feelings,

00:06:48.214 --> 00:06:51.490
his unseemly desire to get
even.

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:59.756
All of these questionable
motives are given a vast divine

00:06:59.756 --> 00:07:03.536
blessing.
It's a shocking expression of

00:07:03.536 --> 00:07:06.509
what Freud would call wish
fulfillment.

00:07:06.509 --> 00:07:09.966
This final work of Milton seems
from a theological point of

00:07:09.966 --> 00:07:12.290
view, from the religious
perspective,

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:14.813
to counter just about
everything of Milton's that

00:07:14.813 --> 00:07:18.848
we've read up to this point.
That's because here every wish,

00:07:18.848 --> 00:07:23.368
every desire -- all of those
passionate instincts that the

00:07:23.368 --> 00:07:28.126
other works were laboring so
hard to suppress -- all of these

00:07:28.126 --> 00:07:32.250
wishes just get fulfilled in
this poem.Now,

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:35.542
I'm not at all suggesting that
Samson Agonistes is

00:07:35.542 --> 00:07:38.069
wholly unrelated to Milton's
other works.

00:07:38.069 --> 00:07:40.790
That would be the last thing I
would want to suggest.

00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:45.565
Milton's obviously imagining
the final action of this poem in

00:07:45.565 --> 00:07:49.944
relation to the climactic
actions of his other two major

00:07:49.944 --> 00:07:52.605
works,
and he draws all three of his

00:07:52.605 --> 00:07:56.465
final works together by placing
their central actions at high

00:07:56.465 --> 00:07:59.790
noon,
at mid-day.

00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:03.419
In Paradise Lost,
Eve falls at noon and Milton

00:08:03.419 --> 00:08:07.111
told us simply -- this is on the
handout but it's also on the

00:08:07.111 --> 00:08:11.110
board -- Milton tells us with
exquisite economy "she plucked,

00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:16.598
she eat."
With this extraordinary

00:08:16.598 --> 00:08:20.423
concision, Milton narrated that
act on earth that initiates the

00:08:20.423 --> 00:08:23.939
history of fallen man.In
Paradise Regained,

00:08:23.939 --> 00:08:27.621
 Milton describes the
action that works really to undo

00:08:27.621 --> 00:08:32.093
the effects of Eve's fall.
That's the Son's resistance to

00:08:32.093 --> 00:08:36.589
Satan's temptation,
as opposed to his giving in to

00:08:36.589 --> 00:08:39.555
it as Eve had.
In narrating this event,

00:08:39.555 --> 00:08:42.483
Milton alludes to the
grammatical structure of that

00:08:42.483 --> 00:08:45.059
narrative crux from Paradise
Lost,

00:08:45.059 --> 00:08:50.591
and he employs another sentence
of four monosyllabic words,

00:08:50.591 --> 00:08:55.169
two of them active verbs:
"he said and stood."

00:08:55.169 --> 00:09:00.224
What was a transgressive action
in Paradise Lost is

00:09:00.224 --> 00:09:05.367
redeemed through what could be
seen as the Son's motionless

00:09:05.367 --> 00:09:08.398
inaction,
his resistance to action,

00:09:08.398 --> 00:09:12.905
or at least his resistance to
any form of heroic action as it

00:09:12.905 --> 00:09:17.068
is typically conceived.Now,
in Samson Agonistes,

00:09:17.068 --> 00:09:20.391
Milton simply can't resist
the opportunity to complete this

00:09:20.391 --> 00:09:23.581
triad of momentous actions.
He can't resist this

00:09:23.581 --> 00:09:27.849
opportunity to remind his
readers, us, of his other two

00:09:27.849 --> 00:09:31.064
great major poems.
So when Samson pulls down the

00:09:31.064 --> 00:09:33.745
pillars of the temple,
Milton describes that action

00:09:33.745 --> 00:09:36.640
with a closely related
grammatical construction -- four

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:39.530
words,
two of them verbs:

00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:44.841
"he tugg'd, he shook."
I want you to pause just for a

00:09:44.841 --> 00:09:49.821
moment and to think about how --
when we consider this sequence,

00:09:49.821 --> 00:09:54.794
how shocking that sentence is.
With this final catastrophic

00:09:54.794 --> 00:10:00.031
action Milton seems to take back
everything that the Son of God

00:10:00.031 --> 00:10:05.184
had accomplished in Paradise
Regained -- this has to be

00:10:05.184 --> 00:10:09.829
one of the most regressive
conclusions in all of English

00:10:09.829 --> 00:10:13.339
literature.
The Son of God had devoted all

00:10:13.339 --> 00:10:16.654
four books of Paradise
Regained to resisting

00:10:16.654 --> 00:10:19.373
action, to resisting vulgar,
militaristic,

00:10:19.373 --> 00:10:21.885
violent action.
He simply did nothing,

00:10:21.885 --> 00:10:25.120
and he was so adamant in his
resistance that Satan was led,

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:28.136
you'll remember,
to cry out with complete

00:10:28.136 --> 00:10:31.679
exasperation,
"What dost thou in this world?"

00:10:31.679 --> 00:10:34.721
The answer to the question was
that the Son does absolutely

00:10:34.721 --> 00:10:38.495
nothing in this world,
or he does absolutely nothing

00:10:38.495 --> 00:10:43.179
except obey the will of
God.But at his climactic,

00:10:43.179 --> 00:10:47.110
high-noon action Samson seems
-- it's amazing.

00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:50.533
Samson seems also to be obeying
the will of God,

00:10:50.533 --> 00:10:54.393
but his action has a much
stronger resemblance to that

00:10:54.393 --> 00:10:57.380
transgressive act of the willful
Eve.

00:10:57.380 --> 00:11:01.052
Eve had followed her own desire.
She had followed her own

00:11:01.052 --> 00:11:05.409
instinct when she made the fatal
decision to eat the fruit.

00:11:05.409 --> 00:11:10.539
Here at the end of Milton's
career, it's as if Milton were

00:11:10.539 --> 00:11:15.039
allowing himself to rethink
perhaps the theological

00:11:15.039 --> 00:11:20.901
implications of Eve's action.
It's as if Eve's act were being

00:11:20.901 --> 00:11:24.539
re-imagined this time as a
heroic one.

00:11:24.539 --> 00:11:28.385
In this remarkable exercise in
wish fulfillment,

00:11:28.385 --> 00:11:32.639
Samson gets to perform his
Eve-like transgression,

00:11:32.639 --> 00:11:37.147
but with a big difference:
with the magical blessing of

00:11:37.147 --> 00:11:40.214
divine sanction.
"He tugg'd, he shook":

00:11:40.214 --> 00:11:44.340
he performs an action at least
as transgressive as Eve's,

00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:47.604
but it's not followed by any of
the hideous consequences of

00:11:47.604 --> 00:11:52.179
Eve's plucking and eating.
It's as if Milton were saying

00:11:52.179 --> 00:11:57.868
to God, "Only this once,
only this once let an action as

00:11:57.868 --> 00:12:03.868
bold as Eve's meet with your
approval."Look at Milton's

00:12:03.868 --> 00:12:09.039
description of the destruction
of the temple.

00:12:09.039 --> 00:12:15.022
This is line 1643 of Samson
Agonistes and it's at the

00:12:15.022 --> 00:12:20.699
bottom of page 590 of the
Hughes. According to the

00:12:20.699 --> 00:12:27.348
messenger who reports the event,
Samson tells the assembled

00:12:27.348 --> 00:12:33.057
Philistines in the huge theater:
"Now of my own accord

00:12:33.057 --> 00:12:36.700
such other trialI mean to
show you of my strength,

00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:41.094
yet greater;As with amaze
shall strike all who

00:12:41.094 --> 00:12:45.757
behold."This utter'd,
straining all his nerves he

00:12:45.757 --> 00:12:51.047
bow'd;As with the force of
winds and waters pentWhen

00:12:51.047 --> 00:12:55.788
Mountains tremble,
those two massy PillarsWith

00:12:55.788 --> 00:12:59.378
horrible convulsion to and
froHe tugg'd,

00:12:59.378 --> 00:13:01.902
he shook,
till down they came,

00:13:01.902 --> 00:13:05.783
and drewThe whole roof
after them, with burst of

00:13:05.783 --> 00:13:09.310
thunder…
Milton's language here of this

00:13:09.310 --> 00:13:11.918
thunderous trembling,
this horrible convulsion,

00:13:11.918 --> 00:13:14.470
is essentially the language of
apocalypse.

00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:18.590
He's imagining the scene of
destruction as if it were

00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:21.840
something akin to the end of the
world,

00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:25.154
and the destruction of the
temple functions here as if it

00:13:25.154 --> 00:13:29.127
were a type, or a forerunner,
of God's final destruction of

00:13:29.127 --> 00:13:32.961
the world at the end of
time.Now the Samson story

00:13:32.961 --> 00:13:37.015
from the Old Testament is an
event that clearly occurred

00:13:37.015 --> 00:13:40.922
before the Son of God's
redemption of man from the New

00:13:40.922 --> 00:13:45.345
Testament that Milton depicts in
Paradise Regained;

00:13:45.345 --> 00:13:49.399
but there's some remarkable
sense in which this text

00:13:49.399 --> 00:13:53.896
describes an event in Christian
history that happens after the

00:13:53.896 --> 00:13:58.802
events of Paradise Regained.
In a strange and inverted

00:13:58.802 --> 00:14:02.470
kind of way, Samson Agonistes
describes the fulfillment,

00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:05.380
the culmination,
of the events that were laid

00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:09.469
out in Paradise Regained.
You can see that the last three

00:14:09.469 --> 00:14:12.496
works seem to sketch in
something like chronological

00:14:12.496 --> 00:14:16.236
order -- even though the stories
they tell themselves are not in

00:14:16.236 --> 00:14:19.160
chronological order,
they sketch in chronological

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:21.269
order the outlines of Christian
history.

00:14:21.269 --> 00:14:23.530
"She plucked,
she ate": we have a

00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:26.467
representation of the Fall.
"He said and stood":

00:14:26.467 --> 00:14:28.419
we have a representation of the
redemption.

00:14:28.419 --> 00:14:32.423
"He tugg'd, he shook":
we have something like a

00:14:32.423 --> 00:14:35.470
representation of the
apocalypse.

00:14:35.470 --> 00:14:39.315
Samson Agonistes in some
ways is imagining itself in

00:14:39.315 --> 00:14:43.293
terms of the closure of a larger
thematic pattern in Milton's

00:14:43.293 --> 00:14:47.500
literary career,
and the astonishing thing about

00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:53.262
this final action is that it's
so completely transgressive from

00:14:53.262 --> 00:14:58.280
any ethical or theological
perspective.Look at line

00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:00.950
1643,
the first line I just read at

00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:04.137
the scene of the temple.
This is Samson:

00:15:04.137 --> 00:15:10.660
"Now of my own accord such
other trial / I mean to show you

00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:14.259
of my strength,
yet greater."

00:15:14.259 --> 00:15:18.637
Samson is in no way here
attributing -- as we think he

00:15:18.637 --> 00:15:23.510
should -- he's not attributing
any of his strength or any of

00:15:23.510 --> 00:15:27.189
his actions to God.
You remember the Son of God was

00:15:27.189 --> 00:15:29.600
always hungering to do the
Father's will.

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:32.757
He was attributing everything,
and rightly so,

00:15:32.757 --> 00:15:35.494
to the Father,
but Samson doesn't credit

00:15:35.494 --> 00:15:40.083
Jehovah with anything here.
He's not even claiming to

00:15:40.083 --> 00:15:45.780
perform this action for the
greater glory of God.I think

00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:51.284
it is possible to read this as
an entirely personal act of

00:15:51.284 --> 00:15:54.395
revenge,
and I'm personally convinced

00:15:54.395 --> 00:15:58.637
that Milton is alluding in these
lines to that magnificent speech

00:15:58.637 --> 00:16:02.149
that Satan had made just before
the war in heaven.

00:16:02.149 --> 00:16:05.893
This is the speech right after
Satan had claimed to Abdiel that

00:16:05.893 --> 00:16:09.093
he was "self-begot," self-made,
"by our own quick'ning

00:16:09.093 --> 00:16:12.914
power…"
Satan had said to Abdiel:

00:16:12.914 --> 00:16:18.601
"Our puissance is our own,
our own right hand / shall

00:16:18.601 --> 00:16:24.280
teach us highest deeds…"
In claiming to make a show of

00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:28.200
strength solely of his own
accord, Milton's Samson in a lot

00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:31.309
of ways seems to be echoing
Milton's Satan.

00:16:31.309 --> 00:16:34.346
He's reasserting Satan's
sublime but, of course,

00:16:34.346 --> 00:16:38.286
completely disastrous bid for
something like an absolute self-

00:16:38.286 --> 00:16:40.999
sufficiency.
But there's a difference,

00:16:40.999 --> 00:16:43.889
and the [laughs]
difference is that Samson's

00:16:43.889 --> 00:16:47.315
claim to be entirely
self-sufficient just meets with

00:16:47.315 --> 00:16:50.610
all of God's approval.
It's the damnedest thing.

00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:55.467
At certain moments it almost
seems as if the character of

00:16:55.467 --> 00:17:00.672
Samson is the character of Satan
simply rewritten as the good

00:17:00.672 --> 00:17:03.210
guy.Now,
in reading Samson

00:17:03.210 --> 00:17:06.375
Agonistes, we're
witnessing something like an

00:17:06.375 --> 00:17:09.425
incredible release from all of
the laws and all of the

00:17:09.425 --> 00:17:12.589
constraints and all of the
divine ordinances that Milton

00:17:12.589 --> 00:17:16.329
had been representing for us
throughout the earlier works.

00:17:16.329 --> 00:17:21.351
The other poems from Comus
on are all about the

00:17:21.351 --> 00:17:25.519
importance of the obedience to
divine law,

00:17:25.519 --> 00:17:29.990
but Samson Agonistes is
all about God's special

00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:33.371
dispensation to break the law.
Think about it:

00:17:33.371 --> 00:17:35.958
Samson is permitted to break
the divine law forbidding the

00:17:35.958 --> 00:17:39.220
marriage to a Philistine.
He does this twice.

00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:42.900
He's permitted to break the law
that forbids the presence of

00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:45.769
Hebrews at the Philistine
festival of Dagon.

00:17:45.769 --> 00:17:52.292
Samson's actions simply break
through every conceivable legal

00:17:52.292 --> 00:17:56.750
and moral constraint and all of
-- why?

00:17:56.750 --> 00:17:58.928
Why does he get to do that?
All of Samson's behavior,

00:17:58.928 --> 00:18:01.849
I think, has ultimately to be
laid at the door of God,

00:18:01.849 --> 00:18:05.329
and in this case,
it's an unjustifiable or an

00:18:05.329 --> 00:18:09.204
irrational or inscrutable
God.Look at Samson's

00:18:09.204 --> 00:18:12.210
explanation of his first
marriage.

00:18:12.210 --> 00:18:16.617
He was married before the
marriage to Dalila and this was

00:18:16.617 --> 00:18:19.529
his marriage to the woman of
Timna.

00:18:19.529 --> 00:18:24.159
Look at line 219 of
Samson, this is

00:18:24.159 --> 00:18:27.494
page 557.
The Hebrews had a law against

00:18:27.494 --> 00:18:31.338
marrying outside of the tribe --
still a big deal,

00:18:31.338 --> 00:18:36.725
many people would say.
The chorus asks Samson why it

00:18:36.725 --> 00:18:40.860
is he doesn't marry a Hebrew
wife.

00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:43.606
[laughs] I love this question.
The chorus asks,

00:18:43.606 --> 00:18:46.940
"Why thou shouldst wed
Philistian women…?"

00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:49.930
Samson responds -- this is line
219:

00:18:49.930 --> 00:18:53.611
The first I saw at Timna,
and she pleas'dMee,

00:18:53.611 --> 00:18:56.269
not my Parents,
that I sought to wed,

00:18:56.269 --> 00:19:00.866
The daughter of an Infidel:
they knew notThat what I

00:19:00.866 --> 00:19:04.356
motion'd was of God;
I knewFrom intimate

00:19:04.356 --> 00:19:08.140
impulse, and therefore
urg'dThe Marriage on;

00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:11.493
that by occasion henceI
might begin Israel's

00:19:11.493 --> 00:19:15.352
Deliverance…
I think we are being invited to

00:19:15.352 --> 00:19:19.154
ask, "Well, how did Samson know
that he was motioned of God to

00:19:19.154 --> 00:19:23.555
marry the woman of Timna?
By what sign did God make this

00:19:23.555 --> 00:19:28.062
approval known?"
Samson answers our question and

00:19:28.062 --> 00:19:33.487
his response is an important
one: "I knew / from intimate

00:19:33.487 --> 00:19:36.771
impulse."
Wouldn't it be wonderful if we

00:19:36.771 --> 00:19:41.084
could answer questions [laughs]
like that with such an answer,

00:19:41.084 --> 00:19:43.630
"I knew / from intimate
impulse"?

00:19:43.630 --> 00:19:48.127
It's important because this
phrase, "intimate impulse,"

00:19:48.127 --> 00:19:52.226
surely implies a sexual passion,
a sexual impulse,

00:19:52.226 --> 00:19:56.843
as readily as it does anything
like a mysterious impulsion from

00:19:56.843 --> 00:20:01.238
God.The big question still
remains: how can you tell the

00:20:01.238 --> 00:20:04.741
difference?
Samson Agonistes is the

00:20:04.741 --> 00:20:09.517
only one of Milton's last works
to imagine a world in which God

00:20:09.517 --> 00:20:13.109
is neither visible or audible.
On some level he had been

00:20:13.109 --> 00:20:15.459
visible in Paradise Lost,
he was no longer visible

00:20:15.459 --> 00:20:17.390
but he was audible in
Paradise Regained,

00:20:17.390 --> 00:20:20.529
and now he's none of those
things.

00:20:20.529 --> 00:20:25.481
The deity simply doesn't assert
himself anywhere authoritatively

00:20:25.481 --> 00:20:28.602
in this text,
and of course that's one of the

00:20:28.602 --> 00:20:32.298
reasons why Milton chose to
write this piece in a theatrical

00:20:32.298 --> 00:20:33.843
form,
a dramatic form,

00:20:33.843 --> 00:20:37.430
in which God couldn't possibly
be seen as a character.

00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:41.898
The only evidence we have for
the presence of a divine will at

00:20:41.898 --> 00:20:46.220
all is the extremely equivocal
evidence of Samson's intimate

00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:48.766
impulse.
Milton won't let us know

00:20:48.766 --> 00:20:52.446
absolutely whether Samson is
really inspired by God to

00:20:52.446 --> 00:20:56.125
destroy the Philistines or
whether he's crazy and just

00:20:56.125 --> 00:21:00.361
thinks he's inspired by God to
kill the Philistines.Milton

00:21:00.361 --> 00:21:04.457
knows that there's nothing like
incontrovertible evidence to

00:21:04.457 --> 00:21:09.039
prove that Samson is a divinely
inspired freedom fighter,

00:21:09.039 --> 00:21:13.075
a freedom fighter rather than a
terrorist, or what seems at the

00:21:13.075 --> 00:21:16.329
end of the poem to be something
-- I don't know.

00:21:16.329 --> 00:21:20.130
We would have to call him
something like a suicide bomber.

00:21:20.130 --> 00:21:23.566
This is why the critical
controversies surrounding

00:21:23.566 --> 00:21:27.984
Samson Agonistes -- a set
of controversies that have been

00:21:27.984 --> 00:21:32.122
surrounding the poems for about
twenty years now -- why they

00:21:32.122 --> 00:21:36.190
really came to a head almost
immediately after 9/11.

00:21:36.190 --> 00:21:40.333
That Milton could be seen to
sanction a single man's

00:21:40.333 --> 00:21:43.339
destruction of thousands of
people,

00:21:43.339 --> 00:21:46.039
an act that might only be
imagined to be divinely

00:21:46.039 --> 00:21:49.246
authorized when there's no
evidence in the text that it is

00:21:49.246 --> 00:21:51.591
absolutely,
definitively divinely

00:21:51.591 --> 00:21:55.738
authorized, had come to seem
more troubling than ever after

00:21:55.738 --> 00:21:57.353
9/11.
Of course,

00:21:57.353 --> 00:22:01.004
Milton is not anywhere
sanctioning mass slaughter,

00:22:01.004 --> 00:22:04.953
but he is insisting that
there's never anything in the

00:22:04.953 --> 00:22:10.019
world like definitive proof of
God's authorization of anything.

00:22:10.019 --> 00:22:15.009
We just have to believe in our
authorization.

00:22:15.009 --> 00:22:19.895
It's Milton's amazing reticence
in this regard that set off,

00:22:19.895 --> 00:22:24.450
after 9/11, a kind of panic
among certain Miltonists.

00:22:24.450 --> 00:22:27.750
John Carey, the distinguished
Miltonist at Oxford,

00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:31.725
the Miltonist at Oxford
-- and you know this from the

00:22:31.725 --> 00:22:35.699
piece that was included in the
packet -- John Carey had been

00:22:35.699 --> 00:22:39.836
pushed to a -- I don't know,
I think a risible,

00:22:39.836 --> 00:22:45.069
maybe even a hysterical,
critical stance toward this

00:22:45.069 --> 00:22:51.226
text by Milton's unwillingness
to proclaim on the question of

00:22:51.226 --> 00:22:56.972
Samson's authority to kill so
many people.In Milton's

00:22:56.972 --> 00:23:01.542
other poems -- and,
it goes without saying,

00:23:01.542 --> 00:23:06.670
in the real world of all of our
everyday lives -- one is simply

00:23:06.670 --> 00:23:11.384
not permitted to act upon all of
one's inmost impulses and

00:23:11.384 --> 00:23:14.204
desires.
We're constantly being called

00:23:14.204 --> 00:23:17.693
upon to be rational and to
resist those temptations for the

00:23:17.693 --> 00:23:20.339
greater goal of the obedience to
the law.

00:23:20.339 --> 00:23:24.226
The Son in Paradise Regained
was able to begin his work

00:23:24.226 --> 00:23:27.539
of Israel's deliverance by
suppressing his hunger,

00:23:27.539 --> 00:23:31.011
by suppressing his passion,
and by suppressing even his

00:23:31.011 --> 00:23:34.289
interest in the beauty of
classical civilization;

00:23:34.289 --> 00:23:38.816
but Samson, who certainly in
this text something like a type

00:23:38.816 --> 00:23:42.959
of Christ, begins Israel's
deliverance by acting on his

00:23:42.959 --> 00:23:46.444
hungers,
by acting on his passions and

00:23:46.444 --> 00:23:49.167
desires.
The intimate stirring of his

00:23:49.167 --> 00:23:53.230
loins might be one of those
things energizing his actions.

00:23:53.230 --> 00:23:57.427
Milton gives us in this poem a
powerful alternative,

00:23:57.427 --> 00:24:01.487
a scandalous alternative,
to the traditional obligation

00:24:01.487 --> 00:24:04.529
to subordinate one's desire to
the will of God,

00:24:04.529 --> 00:24:07.997
and in this play,
in this text,

00:24:07.997 --> 00:24:13.083
one's deepest,
one's darkest desire turns out

00:24:13.083 --> 00:24:19.324
in fact to be the will of
God.That's as shocking as

00:24:19.324 --> 00:24:24.299
anything else it seems to me.
Think of Paradise Lost.

00:24:24.299 --> 00:24:26.565
Milton's great achievement
in Paradise Lost,

00:24:26.565 --> 00:24:28.695
and it really was a
magnificent achievement,

00:24:28.695 --> 00:24:30.690
was to structure the poem as a
theodicy.

00:24:30.690 --> 00:24:34.376
He took what he took to be the
irrational God of the

00:24:34.376 --> 00:24:39.002
Judeo-Christian tradition and he
remade him into a reasonable and

00:24:39.002 --> 00:24:43.839
justifiable embodiment of law,
to a large extent.

00:24:43.839 --> 00:24:47.442
By the time we get to Samson
Agonistes, it's almost as if

00:24:47.442 --> 00:24:50.657
you could feel Milton's relief,
a sigh of relief,

00:24:50.657 --> 00:24:54.954
now that he's been released
from the pressure to write a

00:24:54.954 --> 00:24:56.940
theodyicy.
"Thank God!"

00:24:56.940 --> 00:24:58.748
you can hear Milton saying.
"I don't have to write a

00:24:58.748 --> 00:25:01.928
theodicy anymore.
I don't have to justify God

00:25:01.928 --> 00:25:04.816
anymore!"
Here at the end of Milton's

00:25:04.816 --> 00:25:09.253
career, you have something like
an extraordinary release from

00:25:09.253 --> 00:25:13.689
all of the strictures of justice
and all of the strictures of

00:25:13.689 --> 00:25:17.904
reason that Milton had set for
himself and that Milton had

00:25:17.904 --> 00:25:20.862
submitted himself
to.According to the

00:25:20.862 --> 00:25:26.155
Aristotelian theory of tragedy,
the climax of a tragedy is

00:25:26.155 --> 00:25:31.366
supposed to be cathartic for the
viewer, or perhaps for the

00:25:31.366 --> 00:25:34.869
reader -- originally for the
viewer.

00:25:34.869 --> 00:25:39.511
It's supposed to purge or to
release all of those pent-up

00:25:39.511 --> 00:25:43.599
passions in the audience.
But I think there's a way in

00:25:43.599 --> 00:25:47.564
which the climax of Samson
Agonistes functions as much

00:25:47.564 --> 00:25:51.329
as a catharsis for the poet as
it does for the reader.

00:25:51.329 --> 00:25:58.769
Look again at page 591 -- this
is line 1647.

00:25:58.769 --> 00:26:03.322
I think we have an image here
of this cathartic release as it

00:26:03.322 --> 00:26:07.874
has been inscribed by Milton
into the poem itself within that

00:26:07.874 --> 00:26:12.230
passage that we just looked at.
At the very moment that Samson

00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:15.630
acts of his own accord and
brings the massive pillars down,

00:26:15.630 --> 00:26:20.717
here at line 1647,
"As with the force of winds and

00:26:20.717 --> 00:26:24.870
waters pent / when Mountains
tremble,"

00:26:24.870 --> 00:26:30.764
and then "he tugg'd, he shook."
When Samson pulls the pillars

00:26:30.764 --> 00:26:34.190
down it's as if a dam were
breaking.

00:26:34.190 --> 00:26:38.265
The force of winds and waters
that have been pent or penned up

00:26:38.265 --> 00:26:41.703
have suddenly been released,
and you can see an emblem,

00:26:41.703 --> 00:26:44.790
I think, for the powerful
release that Milton is allowing

00:26:44.790 --> 00:26:49.164
his own religious imagination.
Milton's water has broken and

00:26:49.164 --> 00:26:54.890
it's as if he were giving birth
to yet another fantasy theology,

00:26:54.890 --> 00:26:58.343
this theology just being that
much more fantastic than

00:26:58.343 --> 00:27:00.819
anything he had come up with
before.

00:27:00.819 --> 00:27:04.430
This is essentially a theology
that Milton's contemporaries

00:27:04.430 --> 00:27:09.179
would have called antinomian.
He's generated a text in which

00:27:09.179 --> 00:27:13.690
divine will isn't ever opposed
to human desire;

00:27:13.690 --> 00:27:19.158
God's will and man's will are
simply the same thing -- nice

00:27:19.158 --> 00:27:24.549
work if you can get it.Now,
there has been another release

00:27:24.549 --> 00:27:27.359
in the Miltonic imagination as
well.

00:27:27.359 --> 00:27:31.581
In Samson's show of strength at
the festival of Dagon,

00:27:31.581 --> 00:27:35.961
you have an act of sacrifice
that saves the Hebrews from

00:27:35.961 --> 00:27:40.102
their Philistine oppressors.
Samson's sacrifice at the

00:27:40.102 --> 00:27:43.922
temple has to readers for a long
time now -- and I think this

00:27:43.922 --> 00:27:47.106
seems unmistakable -- has a
resemblance to Christ's

00:27:47.106 --> 00:27:50.396
sacrifice on the cross.
A lot of biblical commentators,

00:27:50.396 --> 00:27:53.069
in fact, in Milton's time
agreed that Samson's action,

00:27:53.069 --> 00:27:55.734
because his arms are
outstretched,

00:27:55.734 --> 00:27:59.368
was something like a
prefiguration of Christ's

00:27:59.368 --> 00:28:02.553
crucifixion.
There is something like a sense

00:28:02.553 --> 00:28:06.156
in which Milton in this poem is
allowing himself -- and he's

00:28:06.156 --> 00:28:09.943
really allowing himself for the
first time here near the end of

00:28:09.943 --> 00:28:13.363
his life -- to represent this
pivotal moment in Christian

00:28:13.363 --> 00:28:16.480
history,
the crucifixion.

00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:21.088
Milton, like the Bible,
has Samson's arms outstretched

00:28:21.088 --> 00:28:26.217
on the massive pillars as if in
direct imitation of Christ's

00:28:26.217 --> 00:28:32.130
posture on the cross.Look at
the very beginning of the poem.

00:28:32.130 --> 00:28:35.265
Actually, look at the little
place before the very beginning

00:28:35.265 --> 00:28:37.839
of the poem.
This is Milton's note on the

00:28:37.839 --> 00:28:40.914
form of tragedy.
It's on page 549 of the

00:28:40.914 --> 00:28:46.294
Hughes. This note starts
to explain why Milton has chosen

00:28:46.294 --> 00:28:50.490
this genre,
the genre of dramatic tragedy,

00:28:50.490 --> 00:28:54.780
for his final work.
So Milton is laboring here to

00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:59.757
justify his decision to write a
tragedy, and he cites others who

00:28:59.757 --> 00:29:02.680
have written tragedies
themselves.

00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:06.867
This is a little over halfway
down -- no, this is near the

00:29:06.867 --> 00:29:10.827
bottom of page 549.
Milton invokes Augustus Caesar:

00:29:10.827 --> 00:29:15.039
"Augustus Cesar also had begun
his Ajax [his tragedy,

00:29:15.039 --> 00:29:18.827
Ajax]
but unable to please his own

00:29:18.827 --> 00:29:23.940
judgment with what he had begun,
left it unfinisht."

00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:27.298
Look a couple of sentences down.
Milton invokes a tragedian,

00:29:27.298 --> 00:29:30.939
Gregory Nazianzen,
Gregory Nazianzen who was able

00:29:30.939 --> 00:29:34.170
to finish a tragedy:
Gregory Nazianzen,

00:29:34.170 --> 00:29:37.285
a Father of the Church,
thought it not unbeseeming the

00:29:37.285 --> 00:29:39.930
sanctity of his person to write
a Tragedy,

00:29:39.930 --> 00:29:44.490
which he entitl'd Christ
Suffering.

00:29:44.490 --> 00:29:47.739
I think it's clear that Milton
is thinking of the genre of

00:29:47.739 --> 00:29:51.102
tragedy here as the literary
form best suited to the subject

00:29:51.102 --> 00:29:56.269
of Christ's passion,
Christ's suffering on the cross.

00:29:56.269 --> 00:29:59.734
Milton, of course,
we know had tried to represent

00:29:59.734 --> 00:30:02.910
Christ suffering on the cross
once before.

00:30:02.910 --> 00:30:07.045
But just like Augustus Caesar
who wasn't able to finish his

00:30:07.045 --> 00:30:10.130
tragedy, Ajax,
the young Milton had left

00:30:10.130 --> 00:30:13.710
his initial attempt at the story
of the Passion unfinished.

00:30:13.710 --> 00:30:17.766
Perhaps you'll remember the
little note that Milton had

00:30:17.766 --> 00:30:21.120
appended to that early poem,
"The Passion," that we

00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:22.599
read at the beginning of the
semester.

00:30:22.599 --> 00:30:25.510
The poem just ends abruptly,
you'll remember,

00:30:25.510 --> 00:30:28.288
and Milton writes:
"This Subject the Author

00:30:28.288 --> 00:30:31.000
finding to be above the years he
had,

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:35.332
when he wrote it,
and nothing satisfied with what

00:30:35.332 --> 00:30:40.778
was begun, left it unfinisht."
Well, here at the end of his

00:30:40.778 --> 00:30:46.170
life, Milton's finally able to
finish the unfinished poem,

00:30:46.170 --> 00:30:51.179
"The Passion." Samson
Agonistes ends with that

00:30:51.179 --> 00:30:55.610
magnificent line,
"and calm of mind all passion

00:30:55.610 --> 00:30:58.339
spent."
That line speaks on one level

00:30:58.339 --> 00:31:01.737
to the fact -- it speaks on many
levels, but on one level it

00:31:01.737 --> 00:31:05.250
speaks to the fact that Milton
has finished "The Passion,"

00:31:05.250 --> 00:31:07.922
 that Milton has finally
acquitted himself of the debt

00:31:07.922 --> 00:31:10.150
that he incurred when he left
that earlier poem,

00:31:10.150 --> 00:31:13.590
"The Passion,"
unfinished.Now,

00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:18.924
we're left to wonder why Milton
is able finally to represent an

00:31:18.924 --> 00:31:24.430
act of sacrifice not unlike
Christ's sacrifice on the cross.

00:31:24.430 --> 00:31:28.880
Why suddenly is this heretofore
unrepresentable event

00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:31.855
representable?
I think Milton's able to

00:31:31.855 --> 00:31:35.802
complete this representation of
the crucifixion because he's

00:31:35.802 --> 00:31:39.950
been able entirely to re-imagine
the dynamics of sacrifice.

00:31:39.950 --> 00:31:42.882
Now in the New Testament in the
Gospel of John,

00:31:42.882 --> 00:31:46.644
we're told that God so loved
the world that he gave his only

00:31:46.644 --> 00:31:51.726
begotten son to save that world.
The Father willingly sacrificed

00:31:51.726 --> 00:31:55.952
the Son, but in Samson
Agonistes the hero

00:31:55.952 --> 00:31:59.623
sacrifices himself.
Samson sacrifices himself of

00:31:59.623 --> 00:32:01.438
his own accord,
as he tells us,

00:32:01.438 --> 00:32:04.160
in fulfillment of his own
private motives,

00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:08.493
in fact, and it's only once
Milton can supply the act of

00:32:08.493 --> 00:32:12.276
sacrifice with something like a
complete sense of

00:32:12.276 --> 00:32:17.161
self-determination that finally
he can admit it into his poetic

00:32:17.161 --> 00:32:22.047
canon.I think this poem is
completely overwhelmed by events

00:32:22.047 --> 00:32:26.459
that had previously been left
unfinished or suppressed in

00:32:26.459 --> 00:32:30.836
Milton's earlier works.
If I'm right about that,

00:32:30.836 --> 00:32:35.129
we shouldn't be surprised to
see the resurfacing of another

00:32:35.129 --> 00:32:39.421
desire that had so consumed
Milton at earlier stages in his

00:32:39.421 --> 00:32:44.589
career,
and that is the desire for fame.

00:32:44.589 --> 00:32:48.003
You remember what Milton had
written to his friend,

00:32:48.003 --> 00:32:50.467
Diodati, in 1637.
Milton had written:

00:32:50.467 --> 00:32:52.740
"You asked me what I am
thinking of?

00:32:52.740 --> 00:32:57.039
So help me God,
an immortality of fame," the

00:32:57.039 --> 00:33:01.640
young, twenty-nine-year-old
Milton had written,

00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:06.625
but he soon corrected himself.
In "Lycidas" fame was

00:33:06.625 --> 00:33:09.626
denigrated as "that last
infirmity of the noble mind,"

00:33:09.626 --> 00:33:12.513
and in Paradise Regained
it's denigrated even

00:33:12.513 --> 00:33:15.084
further.
Fame was a temptation offered

00:33:15.084 --> 00:33:18.944
by Satan to the Son of God that,
of course, the Son of God was

00:33:18.944 --> 00:33:22.298
able to reject without
wincing.But here at the end

00:33:22.298 --> 00:33:25.757
of Samson,
 the prospect of earthly

00:33:25.757 --> 00:33:29.760
fame -- I'm talking about good,
old-fashioned secular fame --

00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:33.695
is granted the dead Samson and
is granted to him without the

00:33:33.695 --> 00:33:37.637
slightest apology.
It's Samson's earthly father,

00:33:37.637 --> 00:33:41.289
Manoa, who labors to ensure his
son's fame.

00:33:41.289 --> 00:33:42.810
Look at the last page of the
poem.

00:33:42.810 --> 00:33:50.423
This is page 593.
Manoa says at the top of the

00:33:50.423 --> 00:33:53.739
page:
[I w]ill send for all my

00:33:53.739 --> 00:33:58.582
kindred, all my friendsTo
fetch him ["him" is the dead

00:33:58.582 --> 00:34:01.387
body of Samson]
hence and solemnly

00:34:01.387 --> 00:34:06.570
attendWith silent obsequy
and funeral trainHome to his

00:34:06.570 --> 00:34:11.283
Fathers house…
I'll interrupt myself here just

00:34:11.283 --> 00:34:14.578
for a moment because I'm going
to ask you to think of the

00:34:14.578 --> 00:34:18.049
possible counterpoint that that
line that I've just read has

00:34:18.049 --> 00:34:20.519
with the end of Paradise
Regained,

00:34:20.519 --> 00:34:26.130
"Home to his Mother's house
private" he "return'd."

00:34:26.130 --> 00:34:28.688
Manoa continues: 
[T]here will I build

00:34:28.688 --> 00:34:31.287
himA Monument,
and plant it round with

00:34:31.287 --> 00:34:35.412
shadeOf Laurel ever green,
and branching Palm,With all

00:34:35.412 --> 00:34:38.624
his Trophies hung,
and Acts enroll'dIn copious

00:34:38.624 --> 00:34:42.900
Legend,
or sweet Lyric Song.

00:34:42.900 --> 00:34:46.175
Now, the "shade / Of Laurel
ever green" is not an honor

00:34:46.175 --> 00:34:49.329
typically bestowed upon the
great biblical heroes,

00:34:49.329 --> 00:34:52.808
but it is an honor bestowed
upon great poets -- at least,

00:34:52.808 --> 00:34:56.287
in the classical tradition.
That's why we have the phrase

00:34:56.287 --> 00:34:59.495
poet laureate.
You have in this incredibly

00:34:59.495 --> 00:35:03.509
moving tribute that Manoa has
given Samson the promise of

00:35:03.509 --> 00:35:07.954
eternal fame that has been the
desire of great poets as long as

00:35:07.954 --> 00:35:12.255
there have been great poets.
The monument built for Samson

00:35:12.255 --> 00:35:15.792
here is something like a
displaced version of Milton's

00:35:15.792 --> 00:35:18.951
own monument.
Maybe this is a moment that can

00:35:18.951 --> 00:35:22.393
compete with the "livelong
monument" that Milton had

00:35:22.393 --> 00:35:25.699
imagined that was the monument
of Shakespeare,

00:35:25.699 --> 00:35:29.407
Shakespeare's tomb,
of which the young Milton had

00:35:29.407 --> 00:35:32.960
written in his first published
poem.Now,

00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:35.774
as you can see from the bottom
of the handout,

00:35:35.774 --> 00:35:39.589
from the passage taken from one
of the earliest biographies of

00:35:39.589 --> 00:35:42.779
Milton -- and this is also
included in the Hughes --

00:35:42.779 --> 00:35:46.720
"Milton at his death was buried
at the churchyard at Cripplegate

00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:49.659
where about thirty years before
he had,

00:35:49.659 --> 00:35:54.630
by chance, also interred his
father."

00:35:54.630 --> 00:35:58.838
Like Samson's body at the time
of his death,

00:35:58.838 --> 00:36:03.536
the body of John Milton was
returned, as it were,

00:36:03.536 --> 00:36:08.211
home to his father's house.
Now we're told here very

00:36:08.211 --> 00:36:12.315
carefully that this happened by
chance, but it's surely not a

00:36:12.315 --> 00:36:16.213
leap to assume that Milton was
himself responsible for the

00:36:16.213 --> 00:36:20.317
instructions for his place of
burial and that he was thinking

00:36:20.317 --> 00:36:24.489
on some level of the burial of
Samson when he arranged to have

00:36:24.489 --> 00:36:27.430
himself buried next to his
father,

00:36:27.430 --> 00:36:30.606
or near his father.
It's as if by returning to the

00:36:30.606 --> 00:36:33.580
father's house,
Milton could guarantee for

00:36:33.580 --> 00:36:37.497
himself the promise of fame that
had been bestowed upon

00:36:37.497 --> 00:36:41.849
Samson.Look at the middle
quotation on the handout.

00:36:41.849 --> 00:36:45.380
As John Aubrey wrote in his
Life of Milton,

00:36:45.380 --> 00:36:49.775
Milton had during his lifetime
achieved a considerable measure

00:36:49.775 --> 00:36:52.967
of fame;
he didn't have to wait for

00:36:52.967 --> 00:36:55.691
after his death.
According to Aubrey,

00:36:55.691 --> 00:36:58.573
for several foreigners -- and I
love this detail,

00:36:58.573 --> 00:37:02.057
it's wild to imagine -- for a
lot of foreigners coming over

00:37:02.057 --> 00:37:04.760
into England in the seventeenth
century,

00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:09.460
the only inducement to make the
trip was to see John Milton.

00:37:09.460 --> 00:37:12.347
More specifically,
the inducement for foreigners

00:37:12.347 --> 00:37:15.971
to come to England was to see
the house and chamber where he

00:37:15.971 --> 00:37:18.519
was born.
It's like a tourist attraction.

00:37:18.519 --> 00:37:23.452
This is, of course,
the father's house,

00:37:23.452 --> 00:37:29.553
and in his life,
the Milton home had become this

00:37:29.553 --> 00:37:35.914
Mecca just like the one that
Manoa is planning for

00:37:35.914 --> 00:37:40.431
Samson.Now,
one of the reasons,

00:37:40.431 --> 00:37:46.088
I think, for which we love or
for which we hate the poetry or

00:37:46.088 --> 00:37:51.462
anything about John Milton
involves the degree to which he

00:37:51.462 --> 00:37:54.835
wrote about himself.
Milton, I think,

00:37:54.835 --> 00:37:58.514
more than any other poet --
certainly any other poet before

00:37:58.514 --> 00:38:02.452
him -- has invited,
I think, a unique fascination

00:38:02.452 --> 00:38:07.449
with the intimate habits of his
mind and for some of us,

00:38:07.449 --> 00:38:14.409
even a unique fascination in
his daily life at home.

00:38:14.409 --> 00:38:18.854
I think the desire of Milton's
readers, or a lot of Milton's

00:38:18.854 --> 00:38:23.449
readers, to imagine the poet at
home is an interesting one.

00:38:23.449 --> 00:38:26.919
At least, that's one way to
explain the strange,

00:38:26.919 --> 00:38:31.053
and for me the wonderful,
artifact that I photocopied for

00:38:31.053 --> 00:38:34.079
you on the other side of the
handout.

00:38:34.079 --> 00:38:37.803
This is a document that I used
to receive -- it's a version of

00:38:37.803 --> 00:38:41.098
a document that I used to
receive every couple of years

00:38:41.098 --> 00:38:44.699
from the Friend's of Milton's
Cottage group in America.

00:38:44.699 --> 00:38:47.224
It's the form letter
representing the now

00:38:47.224 --> 00:38:51.073
long-standing movement to raise
funds in order to restore what

00:38:51.073 --> 00:38:55.049
is the only surviving house that
Milton actually lived in -- and

00:38:55.049 --> 00:38:58.519
its website is something like
miltonscottage.com.

00:38:58.519 --> 00:39:02.910
You can find information about
how to get there and so on and

00:39:02.910 --> 00:39:06.130
so forth if you're
interested.This is the

00:39:06.130 --> 00:39:10.009
cottage at Chalfont St.
Giles that Milton had moved to

00:39:10.009 --> 00:39:14.619
in the 1660s when the plague was
sweeping through London.

00:39:14.619 --> 00:39:18.472
The organization dedicated to
restoring this house is known as

00:39:18.472 --> 00:39:22.570
The Friends of Milton's Cottage.
The president of this group,

00:39:22.570 --> 00:39:25.774
as you can see,
was -- I don't believe he's the

00:39:25.774 --> 00:39:28.630
president anymore -- was one Dr.
Ronald G.

00:39:28.630 --> 00:39:32.740
Shafer, and he used to send
Miltonists just this fundraising

00:39:32.740 --> 00:39:37.042
letter every few years.
I mention this curious artifact

00:39:37.042 --> 00:39:41.180
not at all because I'm asking
you to give to the cause -- I

00:39:41.180 --> 00:39:45.676
think the cottage is probably in
good shape at this point -- but

00:39:45.676 --> 00:39:49.886
I offer it to you to give you a
sense of the peculiar impact

00:39:49.886 --> 00:39:53.239
that John Milton has had on his
readers.

00:39:53.239 --> 00:39:57.375
I think that impact can be
measured by something like the

00:39:57.375 --> 00:40:00.772
almost pagan desire to
memorialize the physical

00:40:00.772 --> 00:40:05.055
presence of this heroic poet
that has seized so many of his

00:40:05.055 --> 00:40:08.225
readers.Now,
of course the ostensible

00:40:08.225 --> 00:40:10.543
project here,
as you can see from the

00:40:10.543 --> 00:40:13.570
handout, is simply to restore
Milton's home,

00:40:13.570 --> 00:40:18.396
but I'm convinced that there's
something profounder going on,

00:40:18.396 --> 00:40:23.142
and it's the deeper project
informing a labor of love like a

00:40:23.142 --> 00:40:26.440
restoration project such as this
one.

00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:30.279
I think that the underlying
desire really behind such a

00:40:30.279 --> 00:40:34.544
project is -- and of course this
would only be unconscious or

00:40:34.544 --> 00:40:38.952
it's a kind of fantasy project
-- but it's the desire to return

00:40:38.952 --> 00:40:42.763
Milton to his home.
The Friends of Milton's Cottage

00:40:42.763 --> 00:40:46.567
are just like the friends that
Manoa mentions in that final

00:40:46.567 --> 00:40:49.387
speech at line 1730:
I "will send for all my

00:40:49.387 --> 00:40:52.222
kindred,
all my friends / to fetch him

00:40:52.222 --> 00:40:55.864
hence…
/ …home to his Father's

00:40:55.864 --> 00:40:59.150
house."
It chokes me up.

00:40:59.150 --> 00:41:03.532
There's something so moving
about Manoa's plea and there's

00:41:03.532 --> 00:41:06.147
something, for me,
moving about Dr.

00:41:06.147 --> 00:41:09.222
Ronald G.
Shafer's plea.The relation,

00:41:09.222 --> 00:41:12.836
for me at least,
is that there's something about

00:41:12.836 --> 00:41:16.664
Milton,
just as there's something about

00:41:16.664 --> 00:41:21.667
Samson, that resists ascension
and resists transcendence --

00:41:21.667 --> 00:41:26.670
just by all of the talk of
heaven the actual corporeal body

00:41:26.670 --> 00:41:31.562
seems so stubbornly to remain.
You remember that that was the

00:41:31.562 --> 00:41:34.185
case in "Lycidas" to a
large extent,

00:41:34.185 --> 00:41:36.932
and it's this case in the final
poem as well,

00:41:36.932 --> 00:41:41.038
written thirty years later.
I think there's something

00:41:41.038 --> 00:41:45.846
profoundly Miltonic about our
own materialist interests in

00:41:45.846 --> 00:41:48.388
Milton,
an interest that keeps coming

00:41:48.388 --> 00:41:51.668
back to the bodily facts of his
life and his home and his

00:41:51.668 --> 00:41:54.948
everyday surroundings but --
more generally than that and

00:41:54.948 --> 00:41:58.989
more importantly than that -- an
interest in the material facts,

00:41:58.989 --> 00:42:03.990
the fact of materiality of
everyone's life and of life

00:42:03.990 --> 00:42:05.854
itself.
The importance,

00:42:05.854 --> 00:42:09.910
the value and the beauty of the
physical is one of the things

00:42:09.910 --> 00:42:13.413
that we learn,
that we get from a reading of

00:42:13.413 --> 00:42:17.308
John Milton.Now,
if I have been unorthodox in

00:42:17.308 --> 00:42:22.420
some of these lectures -- and I
would be deeply ashamed to think

00:42:22.420 --> 00:42:26.072
that I haven't been at least a
little [laughs]

00:42:26.072 --> 00:42:30.941
unorthodox -- it's been in my
sharing with you my fascination

00:42:30.941 --> 00:42:35.079
with Milton's life and Milton's
biography.

00:42:35.079 --> 00:42:38.416
Well, actually,
I think it's my interest in

00:42:38.416 --> 00:42:41.832
Milton's own extraordinary
tendency to write

00:42:41.832 --> 00:42:45.315
autobiographically.
There's an unparalleled

00:42:45.315 --> 00:42:48.769
self-absorption at the heart of
Milton's writing,

00:42:48.769 --> 00:42:51.360
and this sublime
self-absorption,

00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:56.200
I think, of so many of these
texts demands something like an

00:42:56.200 --> 00:43:00.958
equally passionate absorption in
the life of the person who

00:43:00.958 --> 00:43:04.156
authored those texts.
Like the foreigners who

00:43:04.156 --> 00:43:06.550
traveled to England during
Milton's own lifetime,

00:43:06.550 --> 00:43:09.343
I have found myself pursuing
Milton with a kind of -- and

00:43:09.343 --> 00:43:11.369
maybe it's creepy,
maybe it's not;

00:43:11.369 --> 00:43:14.579
you can decide -- but with a
certain voyeurism.

00:43:14.579 --> 00:43:18.179
Something in me has always
wanted to peer in to Milton's

00:43:18.179 --> 00:43:21.256
house and chamber,
or at least to think of these

00:43:21.256 --> 00:43:24.659
poems in some way as Milton's
house and chamber.

00:43:24.659 --> 00:43:28.955
If I've managed to arouse in
you even the slightest tendency

00:43:28.955 --> 00:43:31.650
to this sort of critical
voyeurism,

00:43:31.650 --> 00:43:36.190
then on some level I feel that
I will have accomplished

00:43:36.190 --> 00:43:38.327
something.
And so I want to end this

00:43:38.327 --> 00:43:41.213
semester by thanking you for the
enormous efforts that you've put

00:43:41.213 --> 00:43:43.420
into this class.
For a lecture class,

00:43:43.420 --> 00:43:46.190
I know that this requires a lot
of work.

00:43:46.190 --> 00:43:50.219
I want to thank you more
generally for the work that you

00:43:50.219 --> 00:43:53.516
have performed,
and I take this work to be the

00:43:53.516 --> 00:43:57.913
intellectual equivalent of the
restoration project undertaken

00:43:57.913 --> 00:43:59.012
by Dr.
Ronald G.

00:43:59.012 --> 00:44:02.748
Shafer: the work that you
performed in restoring the

00:44:02.748 --> 00:44:06.558
greatest -- if not the home,
then the greatest of all

00:44:06.558 --> 00:44:11.260
English poets himself.
So I will see you all at the

00:44:11.260 --> 00:44:15.364
exam, but before I sign off,
we have to thank our two

00:44:15.364 --> 00:44:18.679
perfectly magnificent teaching
fellows,

00:44:18.679 --> 00:44:22.391
whom I am going to embarrass by
asking them to stand up just so

00:44:22.391 --> 00:44:24.785
we can applaud them and
acknowledge them:

00:44:24.785 --> 00:44:27.000
David Currell and Matt
Valdiviez.

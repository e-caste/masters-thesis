00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:05.415
Prof: This morning we're
going to begin making the

00:00:05.415 --> 00:00:09.150
transition from the classical
utilitarian doctrine of Jeremy

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.948
Bentham's to the neoclassical
doctrine that was championed by

00:00:12.948 --> 00:00:16.810
a number of different figures in
the late nineteenth and early

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:21.097
twentieth century,
and we're going to end up by

00:00:21.097 --> 00:00:26.345
focusing on John Stuart Mill as
the principle expositor of

00:00:26.345 --> 00:00:29.200
neoclassical utilitarianism.
 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.966
And where we're headed is for a
doctrine that I'm going to call

00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:36.350
the rights-utility synthesis.
 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.546
The rights-utility synthesis
signals that we're looking for

00:00:41.546 --> 00:00:46.743
an attempt to put together both
a commitment to utilitarian

00:00:46.743 --> 00:00:52.030
efficiency that's grounded in
science on the one hand,

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.293
and respect for individual
rights that's grounded in the

00:00:56.293 --> 00:00:59.240
workmanship ideal on the other
hand.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:03.665
And we're not going to actually
get to the rights-utility

00:01:03.665 --> 00:01:08.251
synthesis as it's expressed in
politics by John Stuart Mill

00:01:08.251 --> 00:01:09.989
until next Monday.
 

00:01:09.989 --> 00:01:14.876
What instead I'm going to do
today is explain how the

00:01:14.876 --> 00:01:19.950
transition for classical to
neoclassical utilitarianism

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.120
really went on in all fields of
thinking about the human

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.349
sciences at more or less the
same time.

00:01:29.349 --> 00:01:32.551
There were developments in
political theory that we're

00:01:32.551 --> 00:01:35.330
going to talk about at
considerable length,

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.500
but there were also,
under-girthing that,

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.950
developments in economics and
in philosophy that are going to

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.140
be my principle focus in today's
lecture.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.069
What you're also going to get
as a by-product of today's

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:54.641
lecture is everything you ever
needed to know about

00:01:54.641 --> 00:01:57.569
neoclassical economics in 45
minutes.

00:01:57.569 --> 00:02:01.683
That is to say neoclassical
economics is a brilliant

00:02:01.683 --> 00:02:06.158
intellectual creation,
to a large extent the creation

00:02:06.158 --> 00:02:10.188
of Vilfredo Pareto,
an Italian economist that I'm

00:02:10.188 --> 00:02:13.728
going to talk about today,
but with important

00:02:13.728 --> 00:02:17.796
contributions from other figures
in the modern history of

00:02:17.796 --> 00:02:22.502
economics such as Marshall,
and I'm going to mention in

00:02:22.502 --> 00:02:26.408
some detail an economist called
Edgeworth.

00:02:26.408 --> 00:02:31.146
And they developed a system of
thinking about economics and the

00:02:31.146 --> 00:02:35.732
theory of value that was going
to be tremendously influential

00:02:35.732 --> 00:02:40.470
and important not only in the
way utilitarianism evolved,

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.300
but in the way of our thinking
about markets,

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.370
legitimacy, and distributive
justice would evolve.

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.699
At the same time,
more or less,

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:56.127
there were very important
developments in moral philosophy

00:02:56.127 --> 00:02:59.080
that I just want to alert you
to,

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.847
that we're going to return to
later when we come to consider

00:03:02.847 --> 00:03:06.438
Alasdair MacIntyre's book,
After Virtue.

00:03:06.438 --> 00:03:12.501
And this movement in philosophy
that I'm mentioning here is the

00:03:12.501 --> 00:03:17.389
doctrine that would come to be
called emotivism.

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:22.854
It was associated with a man by
the name of Stevenson who wrote

00:03:22.854 --> 00:03:27.965
several books advocating the
emotivist doctrine when he was

00:03:27.965 --> 00:03:33.430
an untenured professor in the
Yale Philosophy Department,

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.431
and as a by-product of which,
he never became a tenured in

00:03:37.431 --> 00:03:41.785
the Yale Philosophy Department
because his doctrine was thought

00:03:41.785 --> 00:03:43.400
to be so repugnant.
 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:48.470
His doctrine was that when we
make claims like murder is

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.724
wrong,
we're making claims that

00:03:51.724 --> 00:03:56.669
express our emotions,
our emotive reactions to

00:03:56.669 --> 00:04:00.490
propositions just as when we
say,

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:04.242
"I like ice cream,"
or "I prefer chocolate ice

00:04:04.242 --> 00:04:06.620
cream to strawberry ice
cream."

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.816
All we're doing is expressing
our tastes, our emotional

00:04:10.816 --> 00:04:15.401
reactions and that there is
nothing more to say about ethics

00:04:15.401 --> 00:04:16.490
than that.
 

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:20.829
Now, you could say this
emotivist doctrine is an

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:26.184
endpoint in a philosophical
evolution that really begins in

00:04:26.184 --> 00:04:28.769
the seventeenth century.
 

00:04:28.769 --> 00:04:32.089
Hobbes, who I mentioned to you
in our very first lecture,

00:04:32.089 --> 00:04:36.389
criticized Aristotle for not
seeing,

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:40.406
as Hobbes thought,
that what is desirable for some

00:04:40.406 --> 00:04:43.440
people is not desirable for
others.

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.716
But Hobbes didn't,
truth be told,

00:04:45.716 --> 00:04:50.053
take that view that seriously,
because he thought for the most

00:04:50.053 --> 00:04:52.899
part we're all pretty much the
same.

00:04:52.899 --> 00:04:58.894
And if you look at the other
classical utilitarians like

00:04:58.894 --> 00:05:01.910
David Hume,
who we're not reading in this

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:04.069
course but we could read in this
course,

00:05:04.069 --> 00:05:06.800
or Sedgwick who we're not
reading in this course but we

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.644
would have read in this course,
they also basically thought

00:05:10.644 --> 00:05:15.521
human beings were more or less
all alike in their psychological

00:05:15.521 --> 00:05:18.670
structure in their basic human
needs.

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:22.500
Hume has a famous line
somewhere to the effect that,

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:26.399
"If all factual questions
were resolved no moral questions

00:05:26.399 --> 00:05:27.720
would remain."
 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:31.238
"If all factual questions
were resolved no moral questions

00:05:31.238 --> 00:05:32.430
would remain."
 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:35.211
And it's not that Hume thought
we could derive an ought

00:05:35.211 --> 00:05:36.870
statement from an is.
 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:40.036
Hume's famous for the idea that
an ought cannot be

00:05:40.036 --> 00:05:43.170
derived from an is;
that there's a fact-value

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:43.730
problem.
 

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:46.577
But he thought,
nonetheless,

00:05:46.577 --> 00:05:50.269
people are pretty much the
same,

00:05:50.269 --> 00:05:53.668
and so if you can figure out
what makes one of them tick you

00:05:53.668 --> 00:05:56.259
can figure out what makes all of
them tick.

00:05:56.259 --> 00:06:00.730
And that was most emphatically
Jeremy Bentham's view.

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:04.910
It's presupposed in everything
we discussed last time.

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:10.245
If you think about the idea of
doing interpersonal comparisons

00:06:10.245 --> 00:06:13.668
of utility,
and making the judgment that

00:06:13.668 --> 00:06:18.382
taking that dollar from Donald
Trump and giving it to the bag

00:06:18.382 --> 00:06:22.860
lady increases her utility more
than it decrease his,

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:27.057
you're assuming that they
basically all have the same

00:06:27.057 --> 00:06:29.399
kinds of utility functions.
 

00:06:29.399 --> 00:06:33.339
Stevenson questioned that idea
radically.

00:06:33.339 --> 00:06:35.839
He said, "We don't
actually know.

00:06:35.839 --> 00:06:39.533
We should take Hobbes much more
seriously in his critique of

00:06:39.533 --> 00:06:42.540
Aristotle than he was willing to
take himself.

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:47.041
We don't actually know if
people have the same kinds of

00:06:47.041 --> 00:06:48.709
utility functions.
 

00:06:48.709 --> 00:06:53.271
We don't know whether or not
what makes some people happy

00:06:53.271 --> 00:06:56.449
will make others happy as
well."

00:06:56.449 --> 00:07:00.451
And so Stevenson was thought to
be a proponent of a kind of

00:07:00.451 --> 00:07:04.588
moral relativism because he
linked ethics to our desires,

00:07:04.588 --> 00:07:06.293
and preferences,
and emotions,

00:07:06.293 --> 00:07:07.410
and nothing else.
 

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:09.992
And then he said,
"It's actually an open

00:07:09.992 --> 00:07:10.990
question."
 

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:13.658
Stevenson was criticizing Hume
on this point,

00:07:13.658 --> 00:07:17.480
but he might as well have been
criticizing Hobbes or Bentham.

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:21.074
Stevenson said,
"It's an open question

00:07:21.074 --> 00:07:25.524
whether people are alike in
their basic psychological

00:07:25.524 --> 00:07:30.660
structures in the physiology of
their human needs."

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:36.541
And so that was thought to be a
radically relativist doctrine

00:07:36.541 --> 00:07:41.934
because it seemed to undermine
the possibility of making

00:07:41.934 --> 00:07:46.639
ethical judgments of any sort
across people.

00:07:46.639 --> 00:07:49.339
That is a doctrine to which we
will return,

00:07:49.339 --> 00:07:53.759
as I said, when we get to the
anti-Enlightenment and,

00:07:53.759 --> 00:07:56.319
in particular,
Alasdair MacIntyre's book,

00:07:56.319 --> 00:07:58.990
After Virtue.
 

00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:03.793
But today we're going to focus
for the rest of our time on the

00:08:03.793 --> 00:08:08.283
economics of the transition from
classical to neoclassical

00:08:08.283 --> 00:08:09.778
utilitarianism.
 

00:08:09.778 --> 00:08:14.716
And I'm going to ask you to
suspend disbelief for the rest

00:08:14.716 --> 00:08:18.180
of today's lecture and just
trust me,

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:21.637
because what I'm going to do is
I'm going to go into this

00:08:21.637 --> 00:08:22.379
backwards.
 

00:08:22.379 --> 00:08:26.432
I'm going to come into the
transition from classical to

00:08:26.432 --> 00:08:30.336
neoclassical economics by
looking at a very different

00:08:30.336 --> 00:08:34.765
problem that the neoclassical
economists were concerned with

00:08:34.765 --> 00:08:38.519
that had nothing to do with
utilitarianism,

00:08:38.519 --> 00:08:42.640
or rights, or anything that
we've been talking about in this

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:43.340
lecture.
 

00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:47.629
And it's not until you get to
the end of this narrative that

00:08:47.629 --> 00:08:51.629
you'll start to see why the
transition from classical to

00:08:51.629 --> 00:08:56.066
neoclassical utilitarianism in
economics was essential for the

00:08:56.066 --> 00:09:01.386
transition in political theory,
and indeed for the transition

00:09:01.386 --> 00:09:03.240
in moral philosophy.
 

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:06.462
So, as I said,
you're going to have to suspend

00:09:06.462 --> 00:09:10.259
your disbelief and just follow
me through the ABC's of

00:09:10.259 --> 00:09:14.133
neoclassical price theory,
which is what we're going to do

00:09:14.133 --> 00:09:14.399
now.
 

00:09:14.399 --> 00:09:16.599
And as I said,
the bonus here,

00:09:16.599 --> 00:09:20.163
the by-product is,
you're going to get the whole

00:09:20.163 --> 00:09:23.500
of ECON 101 reduced to a single
lecture.

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:29.830
Because indeed it is true that
enormously complex and subtle,

00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:34.581
and as sophisticated as the
neoclassical theory of

00:09:34.581 --> 00:09:39.660
microeconomics is,
it's all built out of three

00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:40.450
ideas.
 

00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:44.993
It's all built out of the three
ideas that I'm going to spell

00:09:44.993 --> 00:09:49.234
out for you in what some of you
might initially regard as

00:09:49.234 --> 00:09:53.582
laborious detail,
but I'm going to do it anyway,

00:09:53.582 --> 00:09:59.038
and I think you'll see what I'm
getting at once we get towards

00:09:59.038 --> 00:10:01.990
the end of today's discussion.
 

00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:10.129
So imagine a single person.
 

00:10:10.129 --> 00:10:13.567
We're going to call them A as
testimony to my lack of

00:10:13.567 --> 00:10:16.144
imaginativeness,
but you could call them

00:10:16.144 --> 00:10:17.600
anything you like.
 

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:21.633
And let's imagine a world in
which there are just two

00:10:21.633 --> 00:10:28.009
commodities;
in this case wine and bread.

00:10:28.009 --> 00:10:33.519
The system of neoclassical
utilitarianism invented by

00:10:33.519 --> 00:10:37.341
Pareto says that,
other things being equal,

00:10:37.341 --> 00:10:41.086
you want more rather than less
of any source of utility,

00:10:41.086 --> 00:10:41.700
right?
 

00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:45.048
We know that from classical
utilitarianism.

00:10:45.048 --> 00:10:53.509
But if you have six bottles of
wine and only one loaf of bread,

00:10:53.509 --> 00:10:58.129
bread is comparatively more
valuable to you than wine,

00:10:58.129 --> 00:11:02.278
so that you would exchange a
lot of wine to get a second loaf

00:11:02.278 --> 00:11:03.038
of bread.
 

00:11:03.038 --> 00:11:06.775
If, on the other hand,
you were choking on your six

00:11:06.775 --> 00:11:10.886
loaves of bread and dying of
thirst the reverse would be

00:11:10.886 --> 00:11:11.558
true.
 

00:11:11.558 --> 00:11:16.288
You would give up a lot of
bread in order to get a small

00:11:16.288 --> 00:11:17.750
amount of wine.
 

00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:22.298
And these are what are called
indifference curves in

00:11:22.298 --> 00:11:24.528
neoclassical economics.
 

00:11:24.528 --> 00:11:29.663
And indifference curves
basically imply exactly as the

00:11:29.663 --> 00:11:35.571
name suggests that you would be
indifferent among the mixes of

00:11:35.571 --> 00:11:39.639
bread and wine anywhere on this
curve.

00:11:39.639 --> 00:11:43.908
And this curve is always shaped
that way, concave toward the

00:11:43.908 --> 00:11:44.559
origin.
 

00:11:44.559 --> 00:11:46.350
Anybody want to tell us why?
 

00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:49.600
What is it reflecting?
 

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:54.379
Why is it that shape?
 

00:11:54.379 --> 00:11:58.851
Someone who's done an econ
class, or somebody who remembers

00:11:58.851 --> 00:12:00.778
Monday's lecture,
yeah?

00:12:00.778 --> 00:12:03.960
Student:  Because of
diminishing marginal utility.

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:05.360
Prof: Yes, okay.
 

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:10.058
It reflects the idea of
diminishing marginal utility.

00:12:10.058 --> 00:12:13.504
It reflects the idea of
diminishing marginal utility in

00:12:13.504 --> 00:12:17.205
exactly the sense that I just
said: that if you have a huge

00:12:17.205 --> 00:12:21.288
amount of bread the next loaf of
bread is less valuable to you at

00:12:21.288 --> 00:12:24.668
the margin than the previous
loaf of bread was.

00:12:24.668 --> 00:12:28.620
So if you've got a lot of bread
you'll give up a lot of bread in

00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:31.379
order to get a small amount of
wine, okay?

00:12:31.379 --> 00:12:35.379
So that is the idea of
diminishing marginal utility.

00:12:35.379 --> 00:12:39.250
And when we call this,
what I've labeled here I-1,

00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:42.871
an indifference curve,
we're saying literally you

00:12:42.871 --> 00:12:47.400
would get the same amount of
utility no matter where you were

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:48.759
on that curve.
 

00:12:48.759 --> 00:12:52.470
So if you have whatever we have
here.

00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:55.620
This isn't very well-drawn but,
say,

00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:59.437
four bottles of wine and two
loaves of bread you would be

00:12:59.437 --> 00:13:03.496
equally happy as if you had,
what does it look like here,

00:13:03.496 --> 00:13:07.600
four loaves of bread and one
and a quarter bottle of wine.

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:11.615
You would be equally happy
between those two distributions,

00:13:11.615 --> 00:13:12.100
okay?
 

00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:15.158
What would increase your
happiness?

00:13:15.158 --> 00:13:18.124
What would increase your
happiness would be get onto a

00:13:18.124 --> 00:13:19.690
higher indifference curve.
 

00:13:19.690 --> 00:13:23.812
If you could have more bread
and more wine of course you'd be

00:13:23.812 --> 00:13:24.980
happier, right?
 

00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:30.202
And so the idea of indifference
curves is that you want to go

00:13:30.202 --> 00:13:31.159
this way.
 

00:13:31.159 --> 00:13:34.370
You want to go from P toward Q.
 

00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:37.596
You want to get onto,
as they put in the jargon of

00:13:37.596 --> 00:13:40.955
neoclassical theory,
you want to get onto as high an

00:13:40.955 --> 00:13:44.048
indifference curve as you can
possibly get.

00:13:44.048 --> 00:13:49.678
For those of you who like the
jargon, this would be a utility

00:13:49.678 --> 00:13:50.710
function.
 

00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:54.631
You want to go up your utility
function, all the way to Q if

00:13:54.631 --> 00:13:55.429
you could.
 

00:13:55.429 --> 00:13:56.940
We don't know where Q is.
 

00:13:56.940 --> 00:14:00.120
It's out in the stratosphere.
 

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:04.818
But wherever you were on your
utility function you could draw

00:14:04.818 --> 00:14:08.500
one of these curves through it
in principle,

00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:13.519
so if you were here,
you could find the mix of bread

00:14:13.519 --> 00:14:18.933
and wine in each instance among
which you're going to be

00:14:18.933 --> 00:14:20.509
indifferent.
 

00:14:20.509 --> 00:14:24.288
So that is the notion of an
indifference curve.

00:14:24.288 --> 00:14:30.654
Now, an important consideration
in the theory of indifference

00:14:30.654 --> 00:14:34.899
curves was to say that we don't
know--

00:14:34.899 --> 00:14:40.840
I've put these equally apart,
but, in a way,

00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:43.129
I shouldn't have because it's
misleading.

00:14:43.129 --> 00:14:47.928
If you get from one to two and
then you get from two to three

00:14:47.928 --> 00:14:52.490
you haven't increased your
utility necessarily by the same

00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:53.370
amount.
 

00:14:53.370 --> 00:14:56.950
These distances don't mean
anything, okay?

00:14:56.950 --> 00:15:01.663
I could have put three right
here because the system of

00:15:01.663 --> 00:15:06.386
neoclassical utilitarianism,
unlike the system of classical

00:15:06.386 --> 00:15:09.813
utilitarianism,
works with ordinal scales,

00:15:09.813 --> 00:15:15.113
ordinal mathematical scales,
and as the word implies it

00:15:15.113 --> 00:15:18.288
means all we do is rank order.
 

00:15:18.288 --> 00:15:23.990
We rank-order our preferences,
but we don't say anything more.

00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:27.340
So this individual A prefers
four to three,

00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:29.471
three to two,
and two to one,

00:15:29.471 --> 00:15:33.582
but we can't say that he
prefers or she prefers four to

00:15:33.582 --> 00:15:37.009
three more than she prefers
three to two.

00:15:37.009 --> 00:15:38.919
We don't know that.
 

00:15:38.919 --> 00:15:41.570
We don't have a cardinal scale.
 

00:15:41.570 --> 00:15:45.100
Remember that in Bentham's
system we had cardinal scales.

00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:48.533
We were thinking of sort of
lumps of utility that could be

00:15:48.533 --> 00:15:51.787
picked up and moved around and
redistributed to people,

00:15:51.787 --> 00:15:52.389
right?
 

00:15:52.389 --> 00:15:55.750
The neoclassical economists
didn't want to do that,

00:15:55.750 --> 00:15:59.775
and they didn't want to do that
for a different reason than

00:15:59.775 --> 00:16:03.038
anything I've talked about in
these lectures.

00:16:03.038 --> 00:16:06.623
They didn't want to do that
because they were actually

00:16:06.623 --> 00:16:09.259
concerned with quite another
problem.

00:16:09.259 --> 00:16:13.782
The problem they wanted to
solve was to understand the

00:16:13.782 --> 00:16:15.658
behavior of markets.
 

00:16:15.658 --> 00:16:22.033
They wanted to be able to more
precisely to predict what prices

00:16:22.033 --> 00:16:26.875
were going to be in markets,
and they wanted to do that for

00:16:26.875 --> 00:16:30.077
reasons I'm going to elaborate
to you much later on when we

00:16:30.077 --> 00:16:33.856
come and talk about Marx,
and the labor theory of value

00:16:33.856 --> 00:16:39.399
and its limitations,
but that's for a future lecture.

00:16:39.399 --> 00:16:42.980
For today's lecture all you
need to concern yourself with is

00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:46.803
the fact that they wanted to be
able to understand the nature of

00:16:46.803 --> 00:16:49.168
markets of how market prices
move,

00:16:49.168 --> 00:16:54.679
but they wanted to be able to
do this with as little

00:16:54.679 --> 00:16:57.490
information as possible.
 

00:16:57.490 --> 00:17:00.808
They realized that for
Bentham's system to work,

00:17:00.808 --> 00:17:03.431
for example,
the government would have to

00:17:03.431 --> 00:17:07.298
have a kind of utilitometer and
run around sticking it under

00:17:07.298 --> 00:17:10.380
people's tongues to measure
their utility,

00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:12.039
right?
 

00:17:12.039 --> 00:17:13.190
Very intrusive.
 

00:17:13.190 --> 00:17:17.048
You need a lot of information
to do Bentham's system.

00:17:17.048 --> 00:17:20.865
They wanted to say,
"How can we develop a well

00:17:20.865 --> 00:17:24.912
articulated theory of market
prices based on as little

00:17:24.912 --> 00:17:28.576
information about people and
their preferences as

00:17:28.576 --> 00:17:30.180
possible?"
 

00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:33.315
And Pareto, and Marshall,
and Edgeworth,

00:17:33.315 --> 00:17:37.816
and others who were in their
circle, thought you could do

00:17:37.816 --> 00:17:40.630
this just with ordinal utility.
 

00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:45.184
So moving from cardinal to
ordinal utility is going to turn

00:17:45.184 --> 00:17:48.720
out to have huge ideological
consequences,

00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:52.123
which I'm going to unpack for
you towards the end of today's

00:17:52.123 --> 00:17:52.700
lecture.
 

00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:56.365
But as an analytic matter,
looking at this from the

00:17:56.365 --> 00:17:59.710
inside,
it had the great virtue of

00:17:59.710 --> 00:18:05.632
providing the building blocks
for a theory of price behavior

00:18:05.632 --> 00:18:11.454
in market systems that required
almost no information about

00:18:11.454 --> 00:18:12.660
people.
 

00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:15.818
All we would know about this
person A,

00:18:15.818 --> 00:18:18.769
as I said, is that they prefer
four to three,

00:18:18.769 --> 00:18:21.400
three to two,
two to one, one to zero,

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:25.542
but we can't say anything about
how much they prefer those

00:18:25.542 --> 00:18:30.048
things because these distances
don't actually mean anything.

00:18:30.048 --> 00:18:34.769
All we get is an ordered
ranking.

00:18:34.769 --> 00:18:37.700
Now, there is one other thing
we can say.

00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:51.630
One other thing we can say is,
that this is a no-no.

00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:56.150
These indifference curves
cannot cross.

00:18:56.150 --> 00:18:59.119
Can anybody tell us why?
 

00:18:59.119 --> 00:19:01.109
Why can't they cross?
 

00:19:01.109 --> 00:19:05.920
 
 

00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:09.019
Wait for the mic.
 

00:19:09.019 --> 00:19:12.573
Student:  Because at the
intersection they should have

00:19:12.573 --> 00:19:16.008
the same utility even though
they're different indifference

00:19:16.008 --> 00:19:16.660
curves.
 

00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:21.626
Prof: You're on the
right track, but what's the

00:19:21.626 --> 00:19:24.440
problem with their crossing?
 

00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:27.328
Student:  Because you
say I-2 has utility of two,

00:19:27.328 --> 00:19:31.250
I-2.5 has utility of
two-point-five,

00:19:31.250 --> 00:19:35.806
but at that point where they
intersect they both have to have

00:19:35.806 --> 00:19:37.250
the same utility.
 

00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:40.540
Prof: So you've got a
kind of contradiction on your

00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:41.869
hands, is that right?
 

00:19:41.869 --> 00:19:43.140
Student:  Yeah.
 

00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:45.835
Prof: Okay,
and just to spell out the

00:19:45.835 --> 00:19:48.530
contradiction more
emphatically--I think you

00:19:48.530 --> 00:19:50.348
basically made the point.
 

00:19:50.348 --> 00:19:54.792
If we're saying that we're
indifferent among all the things

00:19:54.792 --> 00:19:59.007
on this curve and we're
indifferent among all the things

00:19:59.007 --> 00:20:03.680
on this curve we can't have it
cross because then we're saying

00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:07.166
here,
right, two-point-five is

00:20:07.166 --> 00:20:10.364
preferred to two,
but here we're saying the

00:20:10.364 --> 00:20:10.828
opposite.
 

00:20:10.828 --> 00:20:13.779
We're saying two is preferred
to two-point-five,

00:20:13.779 --> 00:20:14.220
okay?
 

00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:16.838
The jargon, anybody happen to
know?

00:20:16.838 --> 00:20:17.440
Yell it out.
 

00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:18.588
We don't need the mic.
 

00:20:18.588 --> 00:20:21.259
Does anybody know the jargon
for this?

00:20:21.259 --> 00:20:23.130
Student:  Transitivity.
 

00:20:23.130 --> 00:20:24.269
Prof: Transitivity.
 

00:20:24.269 --> 00:20:28.019
The preferences are assumed to
be transitive.

00:20:28.019 --> 00:20:32.930
So if you prefer A to B and B
to C, you must prefer A to C.

00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:36.038
That's all that transitive
means, okay?

00:20:36.038 --> 00:20:41.045
If you prefer A to B and B to
C, it must be the case that you

00:20:41.045 --> 00:20:45.133
also prefer A to C,
otherwise you're contradicting

00:20:45.133 --> 00:20:48.470
the principle of transitivity,
okay?

00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:52.700
So we cannot have these
indifference curves crossing one

00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:53.470
another.
 

00:20:53.470 --> 00:21:02.874
Now, what we're going to do
here, instead of one person and

00:21:02.874 --> 00:21:10.333
two commodities,
we're going to think about two

00:21:10.333 --> 00:21:13.088
people, okay?
 

00:21:13.088 --> 00:21:16.720
We're creating a diagram with
two people on it.

00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:22.328
As I promised you earlier in
the semester,

00:21:22.328 --> 00:21:26.470
anything I do with a diagram I
will also do verbally,

00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:30.758
so if you find this in any way
confusing just listen to the

00:21:30.758 --> 00:21:35.118
narrative and then we'll see
whether you get it that way.

00:21:35.118 --> 00:21:39.383
But so now we have a diagram
with two people on it,

00:21:39.383 --> 00:21:39.980
okay?
 

00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:44.000
So this is person A,
and this is person B.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.790
And these axes,
the X-axis, here,

00:21:46.790 --> 00:21:49.058
is A's utility function.
 

00:21:49.058 --> 00:21:53.665
Remember A in the previous
slide was trying to get from P

00:21:53.665 --> 00:21:55.230
towards Q, right?
 

00:21:55.230 --> 00:21:59.588
A was trying to go up here.
 

00:21:59.588 --> 00:22:03.653
So this, on this slide,
is the same thing as this,

00:22:03.653 --> 00:22:04.980
on this slide.
 

00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:11.006
So A is trying to go this way
and B is trying to go this way,

00:22:11.006 --> 00:22:11.710
okay?
 

00:22:11.710 --> 00:22:16.519
And what we imagine is some
distribution of utility between

00:22:16.519 --> 00:22:17.098
them.
 

00:22:17.098 --> 00:22:22.582
So A has this much utility--if
this is the status quo X,

00:22:22.582 --> 00:22:23.278
okay?
 

00:22:23.278 --> 00:22:29.289
A has this much utility and B
has this much utility.

00:22:29.289 --> 00:22:31.640
A's happier than B, right?
 

00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:36.160
Wrong, A's not.
 

00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:39.471
We don't know that A's happier
than B from what I just said,

00:22:39.471 --> 00:22:39.920
right?
 

00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:42.890
These distances don't mean
anything, right?

00:22:42.890 --> 00:22:47.410
So it looks like A's happier
than B, but that's misleading.

00:22:47.410 --> 00:22:52.637
If the different distances are
taken to imply in your mind that

00:22:52.637 --> 00:22:57.444
A's happier than B disabuse
yourself of that thought right

00:22:57.444 --> 00:22:58.710
away, okay?
 

00:22:58.710 --> 00:23:02.068
So we have a distribution here,
okay?

00:23:02.068 --> 00:23:05.978
Now what Pareto said,
he said, "Let's draw a

00:23:05.978 --> 00:23:09.480
line north-south through the
status quo,

00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:13.877
and let's draw a line east-west
though the status quo,"

00:23:13.877 --> 00:23:14.400
okay?
 

00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:19.088
And we'll imagine that there's
a finite source of utility.

00:23:19.088 --> 00:23:24.667
It gets called in the econ
textbooks the Pareto possibility

00:23:24.667 --> 00:23:30.150
frontier, so there's not an
infinite source of utility.

00:23:30.150 --> 00:23:33.868
Now, Pareto said,
"Well, if we draw the

00:23:33.868 --> 00:23:38.539
north-south and the east-west we
get four quadrants.

00:23:38.539 --> 00:23:39.339
We get this one.
 

00:23:39.339 --> 00:23:40.170
We get this one.
 

00:23:40.170 --> 00:23:43.748
We get this one,
and we get this one,"

00:23:43.748 --> 00:23:44.430
right?
 

00:23:44.430 --> 00:23:47.317
And what Pareto said is,
"Well, that's interesting

00:23:47.317 --> 00:23:50.259
because we can say different
things about them."

00:23:50.259 --> 00:23:55.373
One thing we can say is if you
can anywhere into the northeast

00:23:55.373 --> 00:23:59.230
quadrant both of them are better
off, right?

00:23:59.230 --> 00:24:03.855
So if we go from X to Y we know
A's utility has gone up,

00:24:03.855 --> 00:24:07.640
and we know B's utility has
gone up, right?

00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:12.450
We don't know by how much,
but we know it's gone up so

00:24:12.450 --> 00:24:14.808
they're both better off.
 

00:24:14.808 --> 00:24:19.605
On the other hand,
if we went anywhere in here,

00:24:19.605 --> 00:24:23.256
this quadrant,
southwest as it were,

00:24:23.256 --> 00:24:27.740
obviously they're both worse
off, okay?

00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:36.670
Because if I put a point here,
Q, we'll let's not use Q--J,

00:24:36.670 --> 00:24:42.058
let's not use,
yeah, let's use J.

00:24:42.058 --> 00:24:45.026
If I put a point here,
J, we would say that A's gone

00:24:45.026 --> 00:24:46.480
down and B's gone down.
 

00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:53.477
Now, to make this a bit more
real imagine in here this is the

00:24:53.477 --> 00:24:57.210
sphere of market transactions.
 

00:24:57.210 --> 00:25:01.240
This is where A and B will go
voluntarily, right?

00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:04.837
So A will say to B, "Well,
I have all this wine,

00:25:04.837 --> 00:25:07.657
and you have all that bread,
how about I swap you a bottle

00:25:07.657 --> 00:25:08.960
of wine for a loaf of
bread?"

00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:10.190
And you say, "Okay."
 

00:25:10.190 --> 00:25:13.036
You give it to them,
both people are better off,

00:25:13.036 --> 00:25:13.460
okay?
 

00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:15.924
And we know they're both better
off because they did it

00:25:15.924 --> 00:25:18.286
voluntarily,
and we know they're both trying

00:25:18.286 --> 00:25:21.153
to get onto as high an
indifference curve as possible,

00:25:21.153 --> 00:25:21.640
right?
 

00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:25.163
So they swap their wine,
they swap their bread,

00:25:25.163 --> 00:25:27.538
and both of them are happier.
 

00:25:27.538 --> 00:25:33.201
A little more tipsy,
but also a little better fed,

00:25:33.201 --> 00:25:34.009
okay?
 

00:25:34.009 --> 00:25:41.840
A move into here would be as if
the government taxes them both

00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:49.414
and uses the money to spend on
foreign aid to a country they

00:25:49.414 --> 00:25:53.009
both despise,
let's say.

00:25:53.009 --> 00:25:57.530
So they both paid a tax and the
money has gone to something they

00:25:57.530 --> 00:25:58.680
don't support.
 

00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:05.038
We can say that's Pareto
inferior.

00:26:05.038 --> 00:26:08.384
Pareto superior,
Pareto inferior,

00:26:08.384 --> 00:26:09.220
right?
 

00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:13.046
It's Pareto inferior because
they both don't want it,

00:26:13.046 --> 00:26:17.534
and both of them would resist
it if the government tried to do

00:26:17.534 --> 00:26:18.048
it.
 

00:26:18.048 --> 00:26:20.998
Obviously they wouldn't go
there through a market

00:26:20.998 --> 00:26:24.866
transaction because it puts both
of them on a lower indifference

00:26:24.866 --> 00:26:25.849
curve, okay?
 

00:26:25.849 --> 00:26:28.868
So that's all well and good.
 

00:26:28.868 --> 00:26:31.548
Well, that leaves these two
other quadrants.

00:26:31.548 --> 00:26:42.099
And about those two quadrants
Pareto says we can say nothing

00:26:42.099 --> 00:26:43.710
at all.
 

00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:52.078
We can say nothing at all,
at least nothing scientific.

00:26:52.078 --> 00:26:57.010
And then he says in his famous
700-page book called The

00:26:57.010 --> 00:27:02.494
Manual of Political Economy,
he says, "People are going

00:27:02.494 --> 00:27:04.078
to misinterpret me.
 

00:27:04.078 --> 00:27:07.510
People are going to interpret
me as saying we should never

00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:09.799
move into either of these
quadrants.

00:27:09.799 --> 00:27:11.788
I'm not saying that.
 

00:27:11.788 --> 00:27:16.730
All I'm saying is we will never
have a scientific reason for

00:27:16.730 --> 00:27:20.078
moving into either of these
quadrants.

00:27:20.078 --> 00:27:23.650
Because if we were to move from
X to G,

00:27:23.650 --> 00:27:30.150
so that we tax A by that amount
and we give it to B,

00:27:30.150 --> 00:27:36.471
we cannot say that B's gain is
greater than A's loss because

00:27:36.471 --> 00:27:42.686
these distances don't mean
anything despite where I put the

00:27:42.686 --> 00:27:43.328
G.
 

00:27:43.328 --> 00:27:48.775
We just have no way of knowing
because we don't allow

00:27:48.775 --> 00:27:52.858
interpersonal comparisons of
utility.

00:27:52.858 --> 00:27:56.798
And that's the link to
Stevenson in philosophy that I

00:27:56.798 --> 00:27:59.450
was talking to you about
earlier.

00:27:59.450 --> 00:28:06.615
There's no way of knowing
whether B's loss is as big as

00:28:06.615 --> 00:28:12.585
A's gain or the reverse,
because we can't make

00:28:12.585 --> 00:28:17.230
comparisons across individuals.
 

00:28:17.230 --> 00:28:19.769
There's no scientific way to do
it.

00:28:19.769 --> 00:28:22.976
We can't assume with Bentham,
and with Hume,

00:28:22.976 --> 00:28:25.809
and with Sedgwick,
we can't assume that

00:28:25.809 --> 00:28:28.420
everybody's basically the same.
 

00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:32.207
Perhaps they are,
perhaps they aren't,

00:28:32.207 --> 00:28:35.380
but we just don't know,
okay?

00:28:35.380 --> 00:28:38.400
So that is the Pareto principle.
 

00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:41.913
The Pareto principle out of
which the whole of neoclassical

00:28:41.913 --> 00:28:45.184
economic theory was constructed
depends on this idea of

00:28:45.184 --> 00:28:46.640
indifference curves.
 

00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:50.240
A is trying to get up on those
indifference curves.

00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:53.548
B is trying to get along on
these indifference curves.

00:28:53.548 --> 00:29:00.108
And we have Pareto superior,
Pareto inferior,

00:29:00.108 --> 00:29:03.769
and then these two which he
called Pareto-undecidable

00:29:03.769 --> 00:29:08.565
because you can't decide,
not because you're a ditherer,

00:29:08.565 --> 00:29:13.838
but because there's no
scientific way to tell whether,

00:29:13.838 --> 00:29:17.430
in this case,
B's loss exceeds A's gain,

00:29:17.430 --> 00:29:22.759
and if we went up here it would
be an analogous problem.

00:29:22.759 --> 00:29:28.314
Now, let's just suppose we go
back that A proposes to B

00:29:28.314 --> 00:29:34.588
swapping a loaf of bread for a
bottle of wine and B agrees.

00:29:34.588 --> 00:29:36.165
They go to Y,
and then A says,

00:29:36.165 --> 00:29:38.884
"Well, I'll give you
another loaf of bread for

00:29:38.884 --> 00:29:40.680
another bottle of wine."
 

00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:43.650
And B says, "Forget
it."

00:29:43.650 --> 00:29:45.569
He says, "Well,
come on, how about a half a

00:29:45.569 --> 00:29:46.509
bottle of wine?"
 

00:29:46.509 --> 00:29:51.275
He says, "Okay,"
and then they go to Z,

00:29:51.275 --> 00:29:51.970
okay?
 

00:29:51.970 --> 00:29:57.636
And if they then get to a point
at which no matter what swap A

00:29:57.636 --> 00:30:02.727
is willing to propose,
B says no, and no matter what

00:30:02.727 --> 00:30:06.640
swap B is willing to propose A
says no,

00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:08.838
then you know they've hit that
frontier,

00:30:08.838 --> 00:30:11.769
what's called the Pareto
possibility frontier.

00:30:11.769 --> 00:30:18.449
Because now there's no way to
make B better off without making

00:30:18.449 --> 00:30:20.640
A worse off, okay?
 

00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:25.269
They will--"What about a
half a bottle?

00:30:25.269 --> 00:30:26.220
What about a quarter of a
bottle?

00:30:26.220 --> 00:30:28.240
Well, then I want two-thirds of
a loaf.

00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:30.912
No, that's too much,"
blah, blah, blah,

00:30:30.912 --> 00:30:32.837
back and forth,
"Forget it,

00:30:32.837 --> 00:30:34.328
I'm off,"
okay?

00:30:34.328 --> 00:30:37.358
When no transaction occurs,
you know they've hit that

00:30:37.358 --> 00:30:38.000
frontier.
 

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:42.414
So, the Pareto principle says
that in a market system they'll

00:30:42.414 --> 00:30:45.948
move toward the frontier and
when they get there,

00:30:45.948 --> 00:30:47.200
they'll stop.
 

00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:50.887
Now, of course,
they may have gotten there some

00:30:50.887 --> 00:30:51.769
way else.
 

00:30:51.769 --> 00:30:56.845
They might have gone from X to
G over here, and then they would

00:30:56.845 --> 00:31:00.856
have done a new one,
and then they might have gone

00:31:00.856 --> 00:31:02.740
to here, and so on.
 

00:31:02.740 --> 00:31:05.767
And that would just reflect
shrewdness in bargaining,

00:31:05.767 --> 00:31:09.318
or how much people cared lower
down their indifference curves,

00:31:09.318 --> 00:31:10.950
or other idiosyncrasies.
 

00:31:10.950 --> 00:31:15.316
But once they wind up anywhere
on this indifference curve

00:31:15.316 --> 00:31:20.151
they're not going to move off of
it because now there is no way

00:31:20.151 --> 00:31:24.518
of improving one person's
utility without diminishing the

00:31:24.518 --> 00:31:28.994
next person's utility,
and that is what is called

00:31:28.994 --> 00:31:30.868
Pareto optimal,
okay?

00:31:30.868 --> 00:31:37.099
So Y is Pareto superior to X,
and Z is Pareto optimal,

00:31:37.099 --> 00:31:40.039
can't be improved upon.
 

00:31:40.039 --> 00:31:41.880
It's an optimum in that sense.
 

00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:45.048
That's it.
 

00:31:45.048 --> 00:31:50.950
That is neoclassical economic
theory in a nutshell.

00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:55.155
Now, I'm going to show you one
more diagram that will possibly

00:31:55.155 --> 00:31:58.190
look intimidating when I first
put it up,

00:31:58.190 --> 00:32:05.359
but all it does is put the
preceding diagrams that we've

00:32:05.359 --> 00:32:08.750
just looked at together.
 

00:32:08.750 --> 00:32:13.873
And this is what in the econ
literature--it was invented by

00:32:13.873 --> 00:32:18.996
an economist called Edgeworth,
and it's called an Edgeworth

00:32:18.996 --> 00:32:20.410
box diagram.
 

00:32:20.410 --> 00:32:23.462
And let me explain for you
diagrammatically,

00:32:23.462 --> 00:32:27.652
and then if anybody doesn't get
it we'll wait up and I'll go

00:32:27.652 --> 00:32:29.568
through it more slowly.
 

00:32:29.568 --> 00:32:37.048
But think about the diagram we
just did, okay?

00:32:37.048 --> 00:32:42.038
Think about A is here in the
corner, okay?

00:32:42.038 --> 00:32:45.700
But basically now we're putting
the two previous diagrams

00:32:45.700 --> 00:32:46.420
together.
 

00:32:46.420 --> 00:32:50.782
Maybe I'll just go back so
everybody's clear what we're

00:32:50.782 --> 00:32:51.430
doing.
 

00:32:51.430 --> 00:32:59.277
We're putting this diagram,
where we have two commodities

00:32:59.277 --> 00:33:03.848
and one person,
and this diagram where we have

00:33:03.848 --> 00:33:07.950
two people and just utility
we're putting it all together,

00:33:07.950 --> 00:33:12.720
okay, into one big picture.
 

00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:17.105
And so you'll see why this is
helpful once we get to the end

00:33:17.105 --> 00:33:17.700
of it.
 

00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:23.150
So A is here,
and A has indifference curves.

00:33:23.150 --> 00:33:25.140
This is our first picture,
right?

00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:27.490
So A is tying to go northeast.
 

00:33:27.490 --> 00:33:28.759
We have A.
 

00:33:28.759 --> 00:33:29.559
We have wine.
 

00:33:29.559 --> 00:33:30.838
We have bread.
 

00:33:30.838 --> 00:33:36.611
A's indifference curves are the
dotted lines,

00:33:36.611 --> 00:33:37.529
okay?
 

00:33:37.529 --> 00:33:41.506
A is trying to get that way,
that way, that way,

00:33:41.506 --> 00:33:44.890
and to keep going all that way,
right?

00:33:44.890 --> 00:33:48.832
And what Edgeworth did--it
wasn't that it was a late night

00:33:48.832 --> 00:33:52.358
or anything that I put this
writing upside down--

00:33:52.358 --> 00:33:58.650
he said, "Just imagine a
mirror going down here."

00:33:58.650 --> 00:34:03.480
 
 

00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:07.528
B is coming at A from the other
corner, okay?

00:34:07.528 --> 00:34:11.864
So B is looking at bottles of
wine, loaves of bread,

00:34:11.864 --> 00:34:15.860
and B has now got the solid
indifference curves,

00:34:15.860 --> 00:34:19.429
and B is trying to go this way,
right?

00:34:19.429 --> 00:34:21.659
B is trying to go this way.
 

00:34:21.659 --> 00:34:26.869
So A would improve if he went
this way, and B would improve if

00:34:26.869 --> 00:34:29.090
she went this way,
okay?

00:34:29.090 --> 00:34:34.440
So this is an indifference
curve for B.

00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:37.530
Now, it's going southwest
instead of northeast just

00:34:37.530 --> 00:34:39.820
because it's looking in the
mirror.

00:34:39.820 --> 00:34:43.739
B is A looking in the mirror,
get it, okay?

00:34:43.739 --> 00:34:47.800
So B wants to go this way,
as I said, southwest;

00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:50.309
A wants to go northeast.
 

00:34:50.309 --> 00:34:58.864
So if you imagine that this
were the status quo from right

00:34:58.864 --> 00:35:04.719
where A has almost all of the
bread,

00:35:04.719 --> 00:35:08.630
right, and B has almost all of
the wine,

00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:12.219
then this shaded area here,
this big football,

00:35:12.219 --> 00:35:16.920
is the Pareto superior set on
the previous diagram.

00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:22.144
Because if you think about it,
it's the set that if you move

00:35:22.144 --> 00:35:26.840
anywhere in the biggest football
I've shaded here--

00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:32.826
let's say we started here at X
where A had almost all the wine

00:35:32.826 --> 00:35:36.360
and B had almost all of the
bread.

00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:41.458
If they went from X to Y,
A would be on a higher

00:35:41.458 --> 00:35:47.534
indifference curve because A
would have gone from here to

00:35:47.534 --> 00:35:49.916
here,
and B coming the other way

00:35:49.916 --> 00:35:52.260
would also be on a higher
indifference curve,

00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:55.489
and you could draw a new
football, right?

00:35:55.489 --> 00:35:59.420
It would be a smaller football
within the bigger football.

00:35:59.420 --> 00:36:02.440
And then they haggle again.
 

00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:04.659
And A says, "Well,
what about half a bottle?"

00:36:04.659 --> 00:36:07.378
B says, "Well,
then I want three-quarters of a

00:36:07.378 --> 00:36:09.445
loaf," blah,
blah, back and forth,

00:36:09.445 --> 00:36:10.860
and they wind up at Z.
 

00:36:10.860 --> 00:36:17.324
And you know Z is on the Pareto
possibility frontier because

00:36:17.324 --> 00:36:22.583
every proposal that one makes,
the other rejects,

00:36:22.583 --> 00:36:23.679
right?
 

00:36:23.679 --> 00:36:28.371
And so you capture it in an
Edgeworth box by having their

00:36:28.371 --> 00:36:32.059
indifference curves be points of
tangency.

00:36:32.059 --> 00:36:38.242
So at Z, A wants to go this
way, but the only way that A can

00:36:38.242 --> 00:36:44.739
go this way would move B off his
or her indifference curve,

00:36:44.739 --> 00:36:48.190
which is this one coming this
way, okay?

00:36:48.190 --> 00:36:56.228
So the Edgeworth box diagram
just puts all of the pictures

00:36:56.228 --> 00:36:57.780
together.
 

00:36:57.780 --> 00:37:02.440
There's nothing conceptually
new in it at all,

00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:07.362
and it only becomes relevant to
our purposes because it will

00:37:07.362 --> 00:37:12.369
enable us to start thinking
about distributive questions,

00:37:12.369 --> 00:37:15.800
which I will get to in a minute.
 

00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:23.003
Okay, let me pause because I
want to be sure--have I gone

00:37:23.003 --> 00:37:26.349
through his too quickly?
 

00:37:26.349 --> 00:37:30.219
Would anyone like me to walk
through it again?

00:37:30.219 --> 00:37:34.099
If you think you would want me
to walk through it again

00:37:34.099 --> 00:37:38.768
probably half the people in the
room do, so don't feel awkward.

00:37:38.768 --> 00:37:41.739
It's actually a lot simpler
than it looks,

00:37:41.739 --> 00:37:42.320
right?
 

00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:46.719
I mean, all you have to do is
take the previous,

00:37:46.719 --> 00:37:51.668
the Pareto principle diagram
and imagine it with a mirror and

00:37:51.668 --> 00:37:55.380
think of B as upside down coming
toward A,

00:37:55.380 --> 00:37:58.480
and then it just all fits
together.

00:37:58.480 --> 00:37:59.989
Very clever.
 

00:37:59.989 --> 00:38:03.530
 
 

00:38:03.530 --> 00:38:08.824
Okay and the one thing I would
say, this line here is what on

00:38:08.824 --> 00:38:13.766
the previous diagram was the
Pareto possibility frontier,

00:38:13.766 --> 00:38:14.650
right?
 

00:38:14.650 --> 00:38:23.876
This line is all the points of
tangency between--like there is

00:38:23.876 --> 00:38:29.018
one, there is one,
there is one.

00:38:29.018 --> 00:38:34.210
So you join up all the points
at which the indifference curves

00:38:34.210 --> 00:38:37.018
are at tangents to one another.
 

00:38:37.018 --> 00:38:40.702
That is the line where if they
get onto this line they won't

00:38:40.702 --> 00:38:42.949
move off of it voluntarily,
right?

00:38:42.949 --> 00:38:44.960
By definition.
 

00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:51.101
So they went from X,
to Y, to Z, but perhaps if A

00:38:51.101 --> 00:38:56.219
had driven a harder bargain
early on,

00:38:56.219 --> 00:39:00.244
they might have gone by a
different path and would have

00:39:00.244 --> 00:39:02.630
wound up at a different point.
 

00:39:02.630 --> 00:39:09.300
 
 

00:39:09.300 --> 00:39:13.391
This is the Pareto possibility
frontier which Edgeworth called

00:39:13.391 --> 00:39:14.800
the contract curve.
 

00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:15.880
It's the same thing.
 

00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:19.789
It's where they will make a
contract to get to.

00:39:19.789 --> 00:39:25.867
They will agree to transactions
that get them onto that curve,

00:39:25.867 --> 00:39:30.550
but once they're on it they
stay there, okay?

00:39:30.550 --> 00:39:32.550
That's the basic intuition.
 

00:39:32.550 --> 00:39:37.414
So market transactions into the
Pareto superior zone,

00:39:37.414 --> 00:39:42.840
and eventually they stop when
things are Pareto optimal.

00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:47.255
Now, let's think about
comparing classical and

00:39:47.255 --> 00:39:50.199
neoclassical utilitarianism.
 

00:39:50.199 --> 00:39:56.750
If you think back to Monday's
lecture we said with Bentham's

00:39:56.750 --> 00:40:03.521
utility anything--this isn't a
very good forty-five degrees is

00:40:03.521 --> 00:40:04.300
it?
 

00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:05.730
I guess it is.
 

00:40:05.730 --> 00:40:07.630
It just depends where you stand.
 

00:40:07.630 --> 00:40:14.056
With Bentham's utility we said
that anything in this whole

00:40:14.056 --> 00:40:16.516
area,
the first shaded area,

00:40:16.516 --> 00:40:19.846
maximizes the greatest
happiness of the greatest

00:40:19.846 --> 00:40:21.050
number, right?
 

00:40:21.050 --> 00:40:26.550
That was his imperative.
 

00:40:26.550 --> 00:40:29.440
The Pareto principle,
we now know,

00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:34.083
singles out this Pareto
superior area as unambiguously

00:40:34.083 --> 00:40:38.639
better because people will go
there voluntarily.

00:40:38.639 --> 00:40:44.568
So everything that is Pareto
superior is Bentham superior,

00:40:44.568 --> 00:40:45.400
right?
 

00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:51.942
Everything that's Pareto
inferior is Bentham inferior,

00:40:51.942 --> 00:40:52.929
right?
 

00:40:52.929 --> 00:40:55.239
This is uninteresting.
 

00:40:55.239 --> 00:40:59.813
It's unambiguously worse
whether you're a classical or a

00:40:59.813 --> 00:41:02.639
neoclassical utilitarian,
right?

00:41:02.639 --> 00:41:06.730
So everything that's Pareto
superior is Bentham superior.

00:41:06.730 --> 00:41:11.960
Everything that's Pareto
inferior is Bentham inferior.

00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:15.434
But now the interesting stuff,
which is where all of

00:41:15.434 --> 00:41:19.679
redistributive politics goes on,
and all the battles in politics

00:41:19.679 --> 00:41:22.313
go on,
are in the two Pareto

00:41:22.313 --> 00:41:25.389
undecidable quadrants,
right?

00:41:25.389 --> 00:41:30.498
This one and this one,
about which Pareto says,

00:41:30.498 --> 00:41:35.164
as a matter of science,
we can say nothing,

00:41:35.164 --> 00:41:38.829
and Bentham disagrees,
right?

00:41:38.829 --> 00:41:43.353
Bentham's principle bisects
these Pareto undecidable

00:41:43.353 --> 00:41:48.764
quadrants because Bentham makes
his interpersonal judgments of

00:41:48.764 --> 00:41:49.829
utility.
 

00:41:49.829 --> 00:41:54.050
And so Bentham says,
if you go into this area,

00:41:54.050 --> 00:41:58.679
it's a Bentham improvement,
though it's Pareto undecidable,

00:41:58.679 --> 00:42:01.547
whereas if you go into this
area, it's not a Bentham

00:42:01.547 --> 00:42:04.360
improvement even though it's
Pareto undecidable.

00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:07.949
So Bentham and Sedgwick,
and Hume,

00:42:07.949 --> 00:42:13.204
and the classical utilitarians
think we can make interpersonal

00:42:13.204 --> 00:42:18.545
judgments which allow us to say
when it will make sense for the

00:42:18.545 --> 00:42:22.518
government to tax A,
and benefit B,

00:42:22.518 --> 00:42:28.239
whereas Pareto says there's no
way to tell.

00:42:28.239 --> 00:42:30.960
Again, he says,
"People are going to

00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:34.293
interpret me as saying the
government should never

00:42:34.293 --> 00:42:35.449
redistribute.
 

00:42:35.449 --> 00:42:39.260
I'm not saying that,
and it's a misuse of my

00:42:39.260 --> 00:42:41.300
doctrine to say that.
 

00:42:41.300 --> 00:42:44.690
All I'm saying is if the
government chooses to

00:42:44.690 --> 00:42:47.552
redistribute,
there's not going to be a

00:42:47.552 --> 00:42:51.170
scientific principle to tell
them how."

00:42:51.170 --> 00:42:58.599
So just to make the point
dramatic let's suppose--we're

00:42:58.599 --> 00:43:03.829
going back to the Edgeworth
diagram.

00:43:03.829 --> 00:43:07.730
Let's suppose this is the
status quo.

00:43:07.730 --> 00:43:11.320
 
 

00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:16.619
That is, let's suppose B has
everything and A has nothing.

00:43:16.619 --> 00:43:19.239
B has all the wine and all the
bread.

00:43:19.239 --> 00:43:27.309
 
 

00:43:27.309 --> 00:43:32.791
We know they're on the contract
curve because B has nothing that

00:43:32.791 --> 00:43:34.269
A wants, right?
 

00:43:34.269 --> 00:43:37.400
 
 

00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:41.846
So if you think,
again, of Trump and the bag

00:43:41.846 --> 00:43:47.947
lady, she has nothing that he
wants, so the Pareto efficient

00:43:47.947 --> 00:43:52.289
outcome is for the bag lady to
starve.

00:43:52.289 --> 00:43:55.769
It might not be morally
defensible, but it's the Pareto

00:43:55.769 --> 00:43:57.059
efficient outcome.
 

00:43:57.059 --> 00:43:58.949
They're on the contract curve.
 

00:43:58.949 --> 00:44:03.882
There is nothing you can do to
improve the bag lady's utility

00:44:03.882 --> 00:44:07.829
that will not diminish Trump's
utility, right?

00:44:07.829 --> 00:44:09.833
Now you could say,
"But of course,

00:44:09.833 --> 00:44:11.679
she's on the verge of
starvation.

00:44:11.679 --> 00:44:16.221
How can that possibly be the
case," but notice we've

00:44:16.221 --> 00:44:20.518
ruled out interpersonal
comparisons of utility now.

00:44:20.518 --> 00:44:27.360
And so proponents of
neoclassical utilitarianism have

00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:34.199
no way to make interpersonal
judgments of utility.

00:44:34.199 --> 00:44:37.989
 
 

00:44:37.989 --> 00:44:45.260
So the Pareto efficient
transaction is no transaction,

00:44:45.260 --> 00:44:50.199
and the bag lady starves to
death.

00:44:50.199 --> 00:44:53.389
 
 

00:44:53.389 --> 00:44:58.503
You'll see when we come to read
John Rawls later in the semester

00:44:58.503 --> 00:45:02.481
he says the trouble with
utilitarianism is that it

00:45:02.481 --> 00:45:07.110
doesn't take seriously the
differences among persons.

00:45:07.110 --> 00:45:09.153
The trouble with
utilitarianism,

00:45:09.153 --> 00:45:12.253
says John Rawls in His
Theory of Justice,

00:45:12.253 --> 00:45:15.815
is that is doesn't take
seriously the differences among

00:45:15.815 --> 00:45:16.739
persons.
 

00:45:16.739 --> 00:45:21.449
You now know enough to see that
actually Rawls' argument is

00:45:21.449 --> 00:45:25.914
half-right, because the truth is
that's the problem with

00:45:25.914 --> 00:45:28.268
classical utilitarianism.
 

00:45:28.268 --> 00:45:32.440
Classical utilitarianism says,
"Well,

00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:37.463
if taking all of your utility
and giving it to me increases

00:45:37.463 --> 00:45:41.449
overall net utility then we
should do that,

00:45:41.449 --> 00:45:43.768
because you improve the
greatest happiness of the

00:45:43.768 --> 00:45:44.929
greatest number."
 

00:45:44.929 --> 00:45:47.329
We don't care who has the
utility, right?

00:45:47.329 --> 00:45:51.677
So classical utilitarianism is
indeed vulnerable to Rawls'

00:45:51.677 --> 00:45:55.489
critique, it doesn't take
seriously the differences

00:45:55.489 --> 00:45:57.550
between persons,
right?

00:45:57.550 --> 00:46:01.726
And we saw that when you allow
interpersonal judgments of

00:46:01.726 --> 00:46:05.306
utility and interpersonal
comparisons you get the

00:46:05.306 --> 00:46:09.483
radically redistributive
doctrine that Bentham then tries

00:46:09.483 --> 00:46:14.108
to fend off with his distinction
between absolute and practical

00:46:14.108 --> 00:46:17.690
equality that we talked about
last time.

00:46:17.690 --> 00:46:21.360
But Rawls' point doesn't
actually apply.

00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:26.378
The problem with neoclassical
utilitarianism is that it takes

00:46:26.378 --> 00:46:30.980
the differences between
individuals hyper-seriously,

00:46:30.980 --> 00:46:35.876
so seriously that you would say
the bag lady should starve in

00:46:35.876 --> 00:46:40.690
this example rather than have
something redistributed to her

00:46:40.690 --> 00:46:46.929
by the state,
forcibly taken from Trump.

00:46:46.929 --> 00:46:52.210
So classical utilitarianism
ignores the differences among

00:46:52.210 --> 00:46:55.592
individuals;
neoclassical utilitarianism

00:46:55.592 --> 00:47:00.405
fetishizes the differences among
people to an incredible extreme

00:47:00.405 --> 00:47:04.530
so that proponents of
neoclassical utilitarianism,

00:47:04.530 --> 00:47:08.619
like Richard Posner in his book
The Economics of Justice,

00:47:08.619 --> 00:47:11.960
concedes that it's a problem
with your neoclassical

00:47:11.960 --> 00:47:15.836
utilitarianism that if you have
a disabled person who's not

00:47:15.836 --> 00:47:19.780
capable of working for anybody
else there's no reason,

00:47:19.780 --> 00:47:22.565
or as he puts it,
"contributing to anybody

00:47:22.565 --> 00:47:26.018
else's utility function,"
there's no reason that that

00:47:26.018 --> 00:47:28.380
person shouldn't be allowed to
die.

00:47:28.380 --> 00:47:30.572
And Posner says,
"Well, that's a problem

00:47:30.572 --> 00:47:31.969
with utilitarianism."
 

00:47:31.969 --> 00:47:34.846
And he throws ups his hands and
says, "I don't really know

00:47:34.846 --> 00:47:36.980
what to do about it,"
and he moves one.

00:47:36.980 --> 00:47:41.579
It's a deep problem with
neoclassical utilitarianism.

00:47:41.579 --> 00:47:45.271
But notice from the point of
view of the history of

00:47:45.271 --> 00:47:49.775
ideologies what has happened in
this transition from classical

00:47:49.775 --> 00:47:52.360
to neoclassical utilitarianism.
 

00:47:52.360 --> 00:47:57.052
We've gone from a world in
which the doctrine of classical

00:47:57.052 --> 00:48:01.005
utilitarianism was a very
radical idea that would

00:48:01.005 --> 00:48:05.039
legitimate huge redistribution
by the state,

00:48:05.039 --> 00:48:09.753
into a world in which the
radical fangs of classical

00:48:09.753 --> 00:48:15.206
utilitarianism have been ripped
out and it is now a doctrine

00:48:15.206 --> 00:48:20.197
that is very friendly to
whatever status quo happens to

00:48:20.197 --> 00:48:23.710
be generated in a market system.
 

00:48:23.710 --> 00:48:27.532
So it ceases to be this
radically redistributive

00:48:27.532 --> 00:48:31.635
doctrine,
and in the process imports into

00:48:31.635 --> 00:48:36.135
utilitarianism a very robust,
some would say,

00:48:36.135 --> 00:48:40.260
hyper-robust doctrine of
individual rights,

00:48:40.260 --> 00:48:44.681
and we'll see how that played
out in political theory when we

00:48:44.681 --> 00:48:48.588
come to look at John Stuart
Mills' harm principle next

00:48:48.588 --> 00:48:49.400
Monday.
 

00:48:49.400 --> 00:48:54.000

00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:04.460
Prof: Now what I'd like
to do is something that you'll

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:07.705
probably cut out because of
copyright issues but it's a kind

00:00:07.705 --> 00:00:10.333
of fun warm-up anyway,
so we're going to go ahead and

00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:11.820
do this and then we'll actually
start.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.913
I got about a one-minute
warm-up here,

00:00:13.913 --> 00:00:16.799
ladies and gentlemen,
and we've got Lynda Paul who's

00:00:16.799 --> 00:00:18.044
like a Vegas show act.
 

00:00:18.044 --> 00:00:18.610
Okay?
 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:22.179
She's going to warm us up and
we're going to get up and we're

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:25.808
going to get into it here right
off the bat in our exploration

00:00:25.808 --> 00:00:29.140
of duple and triple meter so
here we go, Lynda Paul.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:30.293
Lynda Paul:
All right.

00:00:30.293 --> 00:00:32.930
Those of you in my section will
already be familiar with this.

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:34.600
Don't give the game away.
 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.730
Everybody stand up.
 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:39.270
Sorry.
 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.250
 
 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.280
Prof: It'll be worth it.
 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.730
Lynda Paul:
It's worth it.

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:47.420
All right.
 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.750
You have two moves.
 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.740
For the duple meter,
you have the march.

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:54.680
You may have to turn to the
side.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:55.476
Prof: It's okay.
 

00:00:55.476 --> 00:00:56.030
They can march.
 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.259
Lynda Paul:
And it just goes like this,

00:00:59.259 --> 00:01:00.478
Feel the duple.
 

00:01:00.478 --> 00:01:02.122
Prof: Which foot gets
the down beat,

00:01:02.122 --> 00:01:02.750
right or left?
 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:03.433
Lynda Paul:
Left.

00:01:03.433 --> 00:01:03.850
Always left.
 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:04.995
Prof: Okay.
 

00:01:04.995 --> 00:01:05.378
Sorry.
 

00:01:05.378 --> 00:01:06.269
Didn't know.
 

00:01:06.269 --> 00:01:10.631
Lynda Paul:
And if you hear a triple,

00:01:10.631 --> 00:01:14.790
your step is this:
down-up-up, down-up-up,

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.629
down- up-up,
down-up-up.

00:01:17.629 --> 00:01:20.689
This is to get the feel of the
duple and the triple.

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:22.409
So see what you can do.
 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.530
Prof: You can do this on
your test too.

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:45.830
&gt;
 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:46.890
They've got it.
 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:02:01.510
&gt;
 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:02.609
Okay. We got that.
 

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:38.240
&gt;
 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.645
Okay.
 

00:02:38.645 --> 00:02:41.330
So that's our warm-up for
today.

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.835
Now from the ridiculous to the
sublime, we're going to go to

00:02:45.835 --> 00:02:47.210
our first slide.
 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:50.740
And that takes us to the
question of sound.

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:54.470
We have never really nailed
this down, I don't think.

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.069
When an instrument--any
instrument--the piano,

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:59.440
plays a note &lt;&lt;plays
note&gt;&gt;

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.900
what you hear is one
fundamental pitch.

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.830
You are also hearing very small
amounts of other pitches.

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:10.575
Usually, these get charted out
into the so-called overtones,

00:03:10.575 --> 00:03:13.942
thirty-two partials or
overtones, and you can see them

00:03:13.942 --> 00:03:15.340
playing out here .
 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.908
The amount of force in each of
those partials--

00:03:18.908 --> 00:03:22.479
we'll call it the amplitude--of
each of the partials,

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:25.491
varies according to the
acoustical properties of a

00:03:25.491 --> 00:03:28.768
particular instrument,
so that each of these peaks

00:03:28.768 --> 00:03:31.280
here represents a particular
partial,

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.756
but you can see that they do
not decline in any kind of

00:03:34.756 --> 00:03:35.979
straight decline.
 

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:40.063
Some of them bump up from time
to time--more push there,

00:03:40.063 --> 00:03:41.550
more volume there.
 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:44.080
So when we hear any particular
sound,

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.758
again, we're hearing an amalgam
of many sounds,

00:03:46.758 --> 00:03:52.710
and the importance of each of
these partials in the aggregate

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:57.568
of sound is what gives it its
particular color.

00:03:57.568 --> 00:04:00.295
If you've ever worked with a
synthesizer: I think,

00:04:00.295 --> 00:04:03.412
in very simple terms here,
what an electronic synthesizer

00:04:03.412 --> 00:04:04.968
does is play with these.
 

00:04:04.968 --> 00:04:08.258
They can push down the seventh
partial.

00:04:08.258 --> 00:04:10.038
They can bring up the ninth
partial.

00:04:10.038 --> 00:04:12.939
They can push down the^(
)thirteenth partial and bring up

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:16.151
the fifteenth and thereby change
the sound of a clarinet into a

00:04:16.151 --> 00:04:16.980
French horn.
 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:18.892
They play with these partials
on each of these notes,

00:04:18.892 --> 00:04:20.550
but this is just &lt;&lt;plays
note&gt;&gt;

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:24.420
one sound with all of these
other things mixed in to the

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:28.434
medley that produces the quality
or timbre of a particular

00:04:28.434 --> 00:04:29.490
instrument.
 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.089
Okay. That's that point.
 

00:04:31.089 --> 00:04:33.726
Now we're going to go on and
review a few things that we

00:04:33.726 --> 00:04:35.069
talked about last lecture.
 

00:04:35.069 --> 00:04:38.206
Remember we were talking about
beat, which is the regular

00:04:38.206 --> 00:04:40.672
pulse, the pulse of life,
the pulse of music,

00:04:40.672 --> 00:04:42.690
that comes at regular
intervals.

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:46.699
We were talking about the
subdivision of that pulse,

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:50.790
the organizing of that pulse
into meters,

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:55.423
and that we had this capacity
to indicate what the meter was

00:04:55.423 --> 00:04:57.779
by these numbers:
two-four,

00:04:57.779 --> 00:05:01.110
and three-four for duple and
triple meter.

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:03.470
Remember we were just
demonstrating,

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:06.100
listening to the Ravel
Bolero.

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:09.560
Then we had rhythms
superimposed.

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.170
We had two prominent rhythms up
above.

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:16.846
Rhythm is simply these
patterns, usually repeating

00:05:16.846 --> 00:05:22.286
patterns, of longs and short
that get superimposed as they

00:05:22.286 --> 00:05:26.389
set up above the basic beat
underneath.

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:30.206
We also learned from Ravel's
Bolero that nobody

00:05:30.206 --> 00:05:33.903
actually plays the beat--
that's too basic--but our mind,

00:05:33.903 --> 00:05:36.110
hearing all of these complex
rhythms,

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:40.529
extrapolates the beat from this
complexity.

00:05:40.529 --> 00:05:43.110
Okay, that by way of a quick
review.

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:46.079
Now two other terms that we
have touched on.

00:05:46.079 --> 00:05:51.139
What's tempo in music?
 

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:52.269
Yes, gentleman?
 

00:05:52.269 --> 00:05:53.709
Student: The pace or the
speed of the piece?

00:05:53.709 --> 00:05:57.269
Prof: It's the pace or
speed of the--

00:05:57.269 --> 00:05:58.449
Student: Piece.
 

00:05:58.449 --> 00:06:00.939
Prof: --of the piece,
particularly the beat.

00:06:00.939 --> 00:06:03.004
The beat will
do--control--that,

00:06:03.004 --> 00:06:05.670
so it's the pace or speed of
the beat.

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:06.579
Thanks very much.
 

00:06:06.579 --> 00:06:12.226
We can take a particular--Here
I'm conducting in three:

00:06:12.226 --> 00:06:13.783
one,
two, three, one,

00:06:13.783 --> 00:06:14.970
two, three, one,
two,

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:16.819
three, one, two,
three, one, two,

00:06:16.819 --> 00:06:18.872
three,
and obviously I'm accelerating

00:06:18.872 --> 00:06:19.230
there.
 

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:22.389
We use the fancy Italian term
"accelerando"

00:06:22.389 --> 00:06:22.980
for that.
 

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:26.278
We could be going with a very
fast tempo, three,

00:06:26.278 --> 00:06:28.523
one, two, three,
one, two, three,

00:06:28.523 --> 00:06:31.189
one, two, three,
and slow it down.

00:06:31.189 --> 00:06:34.069
Obviously, we would be
retarding the music,

00:06:34.069 --> 00:06:37.980
ritardando or a retard
at that particular point.

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:38.584
All right.
 

00:06:38.584 --> 00:06:41.550
With that by the way of
background, let's go on to

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:45.062
two--what we might call rhythmic
devices here--two rhythmic

00:06:45.062 --> 00:06:45.850
devices.
 

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:48.509
The first is syncopation.
 

00:06:48.509 --> 00:06:50.879
We worked a little bit with
this last time.

00:06:50.879 --> 00:06:54.291
For syncopation,
let's go to the board over

00:06:54.291 --> 00:06:54.860
here.
 

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:58.990
If we have a particular rhythm,
and this is a rhythm,

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:01.180
and here are the beats and the
meter underneath,

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:04.300
we would be coming along one,
two-and,

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:07.949
one, two,&gt;.
 

00:07:07.949 --> 00:07:08.288
Okay.
 

00:07:08.288 --> 00:07:12.091
Obviously, this is the bar of
syncopation--we did this in

00:07:12.091 --> 00:07:16.100
section last week--but you can
see &gt;

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:17.970
this note is the syncopated
note.

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:19.819
It's jumping in too early.
 

00:07:19.819 --> 00:07:22.180
We expect it to sound there.
 

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:26.497
So what syncopation is is
simply the insertion of an

00:07:26.497 --> 00:07:29.769
impulse,
a "hit" if you will,

00:07:29.769 --> 00:07:34.079
at a metrical place that we do
not expect it to be.

00:07:34.079 --> 00:07:36.769
Usually, the metrical impulse
is on the beat.

00:07:36.769 --> 00:07:42.940
With syncopation the impulse
can come suddenly off the beat,

00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:49.319
and it gives it a little snap
or jazzy aspect to the music.

00:07:49.319 --> 00:07:52.040
We talked about that in the
Cole Porter last time.

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:52.990
Here is one I remember.
 

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:56.430
A couple of years ago there was
a clothing store called TJ Maxx.

00:07:56.430 --> 00:08:00.446
They had this little jingle out
there, &gt;

00:08:00.446 --> 00:08:04.326
, just a little bit of this,
and then you were supposed to

00:08:04.326 --> 00:08:06.300
say, "TJ Maxx."
 

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:09.767
I'll remember TJ Maxx forever
because of this guy's little

00:08:09.767 --> 00:08:10.620
syncopation.
 

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:11.540
It's in there.
 

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:13.300
We really remember these
musical .

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:16.144
Think about back in your
childhood, your nursery rhymes,

00:08:16.144 --> 00:08:18.473
the capacity of aural material
to be retained.

00:08:18.473 --> 00:08:18.939
Okay.
 

00:08:18.939 --> 00:08:19.949
&gt;
 

00:08:19.949 --> 00:08:20.800
Here's beat two.
 

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:22.009
It jumps in too early.
 

00:08:22.009 --> 00:08:24.879
This actually I think derives
from a Greek word,

00:08:24.879 --> 00:08:26.956
"synkope,"
s-y-n-k-o-p-e,

00:08:26.956 --> 00:08:27.689
synkope.
 

00:08:27.689 --> 00:08:28.689
Is that how you pronounce it?
 

00:08:28.689 --> 00:08:33.203
But it means to cut short,
to cut short and therefore get

00:08:33.203 --> 00:08:35.298
in a little bit earlier.
 

00:08:35.298 --> 00:08:39.385
Now the master of syncopation,
of course, in music was Scott

00:08:39.385 --> 00:08:43.056
Joplin, African American
composer writing a lot around

00:08:43.056 --> 00:08:44.095
the area of St.
 

00:08:44.095 --> 00:08:47.418
Louis in the turn of the
twentieth century.

00:08:47.418 --> 00:08:50.158
You know his music from pieces
such as "The

00:08:50.158 --> 00:08:53.013
Entertainer,"
so let's play just a little bit

00:08:53.013 --> 00:08:55.808
of "The Entertainer"
very slowly,

00:08:55.808 --> 00:08:59.649
and my question to you is:
where is the syncopation?

00:08:59.649 --> 00:09:03.187
Is it in the left hand of the
piano or in the right hand of

00:09:03.187 --> 00:09:03.919
the piano?
 

00:09:03.919 --> 00:09:05.870
Is it in the bass or the melody?
 

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:31.600
&gt;
 

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:33.230
Where's the syncopation?
 

00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:34.509
Left hand? Right hand?
 

00:09:34.509 --> 00:09:35.440
Right hand.
 

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:38.039
Bass is just going--Well,
what is the bass going?

00:09:38.039 --> 00:09:49.558
&gt;
 

00:09:49.558 --> 00:09:52.799
In that fashion,
one--It's playing eighth notes,

00:09:52.799 --> 00:09:55.798
one-and, two-and;
it's subdividing the beat

00:09:55.798 --> 00:09:59.308
whereas the syncopation
&gt;

00:09:59.308 --> 00:10:02.809
--it's there,
&gt;

00:10:02.809 --> 00:10:03.500
and so on.
 

00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:04.899
So you're tapping your foot.
 

00:10:04.899 --> 00:10:08.971
You're tapping the beat and a
lot of the music is coming off

00:10:08.971 --> 00:10:09.730
the beat.
 

00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:10.710
Let's see if we can do that.
 

00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:14.467
Let's see if we can create our
own syncopated orchestra in

00:10:14.467 --> 00:10:14.929
here.
 

00:10:14.929 --> 00:10:16.690
We've got an example up here.
 

00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:18.730
This is the conception of it.
 

00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:21.340
Let's see if we can actually
execute it.

00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:23.740
What I'd like you to do:
Everybody tap your foot.

00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:27.240
We're going to do this in four,
just for--just because I think

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:31.029
it works out better so everybody
tap your foot with a four beat.

00:10:31.029 --> 00:10:31.548
Here we go.
 

00:10:31.548 --> 00:10:34.731
One, two, three,
four, one, two,

00:10:34.731 --> 00:10:37.710
three, four,
nice and loud.

00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:40.019
Come on. I want to hear it.
 

00:10:40.019 --> 00:10:40.350
Okay.
 

00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:43.394
Now take your hand on a chair
or your notebook,

00:10:43.394 --> 00:10:47.099
your computer or whatever,
and do syncopation off of that

00:10:47.099 --> 00:10:49.149
according to this pattern.
 

00:10:49.149 --> 00:10:51.139
One, two, ready, go.
 

00:10:51.139 --> 00:11:04.870
&gt;
 

00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:05.379
Okay. Good.
 

00:11:05.379 --> 00:11:07.370
I see Daniel down here has got
this nailed.

00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:08.720
Okay.
 

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:12.413
So that's what syncopation is
and it isn't much more difficult

00:11:12.413 --> 00:11:13.139
than that.
 

00:11:13.139 --> 00:11:16.140
The second rhythmic device that
we have to be aware of in music

00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:18.899
we frequently encounter is this
concept of the triplet.

00:11:18.899 --> 00:11:23.586
Now most music that we listen
to--and here's a good example

00:11:23.586 --> 00:11:27.788
because it plays it out so
clearly in the melody--

00:11:27.788 --> 00:11:30.928
most music that we listen to
takes the beat--

00:11:30.928 --> 00:11:34.576
one, two, one,
two--and subdivides it into

00:11:34.576 --> 00:11:37.154
two: one-and,
two-and--musicians like this

00:11:37.154 --> 00:11:38.269
"and"
business--

00:11:38.269 --> 00:11:40.710
one-and, two-and,
one-and, two-and--

00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:42.590
So each quarter note has two
eighth notes.

00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:45.770
We could also take the two
eighth notes and divide them

00:11:45.770 --> 00:11:49.070
into two sixteenth notes and
then we get a-one-a-and,

00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:50.674
a-two-a-and,
a-one-a-and,

00:11:50.674 --> 00:11:52.950
a-two-a-and something like
that.

00:11:52.950 --> 00:11:58.940
&gt;
 

00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:02.808
&gt;
 

00:12:02.808 --> 00:12:05.990
But of course most
music--although it operates that

00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:08.980
way--not all music continues in
that fashion.

00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:11.361
Oftentimes--occa
sionally--occasionally,

00:12:11.361 --> 00:12:14.842
oftentimes, somewhere between
the two--the beat is divided

00:12:14.842 --> 00:12:15.759
into three.
 

00:12:15.759 --> 00:12:18.658
So what I've got here is an
example of that.

00:12:18.658 --> 00:12:23.236
It's actually what we call
"My Country 'Tis Of

00:12:23.236 --> 00:12:26.899
Thee" I think,
&gt;

00:12:26.899 --> 00:12:28.639
, so that's it.
 

00:12:28.639 --> 00:12:32.375
I think it's been set by a
number of composers over the

00:12:32.375 --> 00:12:32.928
years.
 

00:12:32.928 --> 00:12:37.525
Beethoven set it under the
heading of "God Save the

00:12:37.525 --> 00:12:41.120
King," George the Third or
somebody.

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:44.980
No, George the Third was
probably dead by then.

00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:50.419
Who was the king of England,
let's say, in 1810?

00:12:50.419 --> 00:12:51.879
Who knows that answer?
 

00:12:51.879 --> 00:12:53.450
I don't know it.
 

00:12:53.450 --> 00:12:56.070
George the Third would have
been dead.

00:12:56.070 --> 00:12:56.899
Okay.
 

00:12:56.899 --> 00:12:58.485
In any event,
we're coming along toward the

00:12:58.485 --> 00:12:58.940
end of it.
 

00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:10.629
&gt;
 

00:13:10.629 --> 00:13:12.989
So you can hear
&gt;

00:13:12.989 --> 00:13:16.331
, the triplet being inserted,
so a triplet is simply

00:13:16.331 --> 00:13:19.215
insertion of three notes in the
place of two,

00:13:19.215 --> 00:13:21.639
not more complicated than that.
 

00:13:21.639 --> 00:13:26.743
Here is what we would expect,
&gt;

00:13:26.743 --> 00:13:30.519
, but we got
&gt;.

00:13:30.519 --> 00:13:34.754
The interesting thing here is
that the bass continues along

00:13:34.754 --> 00:13:36.580
with the duple pattern.
 

00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:39.620
The bass is going &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:44.950
where the upper voice has
&gt;.

00:13:44.950 --> 00:13:47.870
Beethoven could have made that
bass go with triplets too.

00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:49.038
Actually, it's all set up for
it.

00:13:49.038 --> 00:13:50.664
&gt;
 

00:13:50.664 --> 00:13:54.155
Both melody and bass could have
had a triplet &lt;&lt;plays

00:13:54.155 --> 00:13:55.120
piano&gt;&gt;
 

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:57.866
but he chose to have the duple
in the bass--the triple up

00:13:57.866 --> 00:13:58.259
above.
 

00:13:58.259 --> 00:13:59.298
&gt;
 

00:13:59.298 --> 00:14:01.793
Let's see if we can do that,
and it's a little bit of a

00:14:01.793 --> 00:14:03.178
challenge for the performer.
 

00:14:03.178 --> 00:14:07.200
Let's see if you can tap your
left hand to a duple pattern,

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:10.360
one, two, one,
two, and then take your right

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:14.548
hand and do a triplet against it
in a triplet pattern,

00:14:14.548 --> 00:14:21.096
one, two, ready,
go, &gt;

00:14:21.096 --> 00:14:24.769
, one, two, one,
two.

00:14:24.769 --> 00:14:28.302
It's harder than you think,
right, but that's the kind of

00:14:28.302 --> 00:14:31.077
thing that musicians,
particularly percussion

00:14:31.077 --> 00:14:33.600
players, have to be able to
execute.

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:34.410
All right.
 

00:14:34.410 --> 00:14:37.980
Now an insertion,
sort of discursus.

00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:41.980
We're going to talk a little
bit about musical texture.

00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:50.480
This is discussed in your
textbook in chapter six.

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:55.341
Texture in music is the
dispositions of the musical

00:14:55.341 --> 00:14:56.120
lines.
 

00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:58.626
I was trying to think this
morning of an analogy and I

00:14:58.626 --> 00:15:00.330
thought I came up with a good
one.

00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:03.172
It has to do with tapestries
and carpets and things like that

00:15:03.172 --> 00:15:05.918
where you weave different
strands in in different ways,

00:15:05.918 --> 00:15:08.397
and somewhere in my deep
recesses I have these words

00:15:08.397 --> 00:15:10.388
"wep"
(sic) and "warp"

00:15:10.388 --> 00:15:11.700
or something like that.
 

00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:14.269
Does that make any--does that
have any resonance to you?

00:15:14.269 --> 00:15:15.570
No. All right.
 

00:15:15.570 --> 00:15:17.190
I think it's out there in
weaving.

00:15:17.190 --> 00:15:17.798
I've got to dig it out.
 

00:15:17.798 --> 00:15:20.427
I tried to find it on Google
really quick and nothing came

00:15:20.427 --> 00:15:22.962
up, but I think there is this
idea of how you organize a

00:15:22.962 --> 00:15:24.298
tapestry in that fashion.
 

00:15:24.298 --> 00:15:26.375
In any event,
in music we have different

00:15:26.375 --> 00:15:29.730
strands and these strands can be
organized in different ways.

00:15:29.730 --> 00:15:33.514
We simplify it by saying this:
that there are three

00:15:33.514 --> 00:15:36.542
fundamental textures:
monophonic texture,

00:15:36.542 --> 00:15:40.100
homophonic texture,
and polyphonic texture.

00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:44.850
And, to exemplify this,
one day it occurred to me well,

00:15:44.850 --> 00:15:47.668
why not take a tune that
everybody knows,

00:15:47.668 --> 00:15:51.565
"Amazing Grace,"
and set it in different ways to

00:15:51.565 --> 00:15:53.820
exemplify these three textures.
 

00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:56.548
So that's what we've got on the
sheet for today.

00:15:56.548 --> 00:16:00.333
Everybody's got the sheet there
and what I would like to do is

00:16:00.333 --> 00:16:03.201
just have everyone,
all of this--We'll just sing

00:16:03.201 --> 00:16:04.330
"la"
here.

00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:05.720
We won't sing the text.
 

00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:08.359
We'll just sing "Amazing
Grace" and we'll kind of

00:16:08.359 --> 00:16:09.269
start it at pitch.
 

00:16:09.269 --> 00:16:09.736
&gt;
 

00:16:09.736 --> 00:16:10.360
&gt;
 

00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:11.879
Hey, pretty good today.
 

00:16:11.879 --> 00:16:12.639
Okay?
 

00:16:12.639 --> 00:16:16.111
So we'll start it at pitch
there and I'll give you two and

00:16:16.111 --> 00:16:19.217
then we'll sing "la"
and we will exemplify

00:16:19.217 --> 00:16:20.620
monophonic texture.
 

00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:22.730
Here we go, one, sing.
 

00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:31.620
&gt;
 

00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:33.100
Okay. That's all we have to do.
 

00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:35.912
You don't have to read the
notes 'cause you've got the

00:16:35.912 --> 00:16:38.460
sound in your ears,
part of your aural memory.

00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:41.740
So that's monophonic texture,
just one pitch.

00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:44.200
Actually, was it just one pitch?
 

00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:45.820
What do you think about that?
 

00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:46.789
How many pitches?
 

00:16:46.789 --> 00:16:47.950
Let's do this again.
 

00:16:47.950 --> 00:16:48.629
We'll sing it again.
 

00:16:48.629 --> 00:16:51.509
How many actual frequencies are
we generating here?

00:16:51.509 --> 00:16:52.830
One, sing.
 

00:16:52.830 --> 00:17:01.990
&gt;
 

00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:04.730
So how many pitches are we
generating?

00:17:04.730 --> 00:17:06.568
Really, two.
 

00:17:06.568 --> 00:17:09.450
The gentlemen are singing in
one octave.

00:17:09.450 --> 00:17:13.598
We're singing below middle C
&gt;

00:17:13.598 --> 00:17:16.571
and the ladies are singing up
an octave &lt;&lt;plays

00:17:16.571 --> 00:17:17.430
piano&gt;&gt;
 

00:17:17.430 --> 00:17:20.692
but that's still monophonic
texture--those notes have the

00:17:20.692 --> 00:17:21.450
same names.
 

00:17:21.450 --> 00:17:24.153
I--We were going &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:17:24.153 --> 00:17:25.598
&gt;
 

00:17:25.598 --> 00:17:28.954
so as long as the notes have
the same names or it sounds the

00:17:28.954 --> 00:17:31.361
same,
even though there may be octave

00:17:31.361 --> 00:17:35.390
doubling in there we still think
of that as monophonic texture.

00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:36.410
Lynda, come on up.
 

00:17:36.410 --> 00:17:40.349
We're going to exemplify
homophonic texture here and we

00:17:40.349 --> 00:17:44.436
want you to sing the melody and
we'll try to do the parts

00:17:44.436 --> 00:17:45.970
underneath of it.
 

00:17:45.970 --> 00:17:49.059
Homophonic texture is where it
all lines up pretty much

00:17:49.059 --> 00:17:52.672
together;
all the parts are changing

00:17:52.672 --> 00:17:53.819
together.
 

00:17:53.819 --> 00:17:56.170
One, sing.
 

00:17:56.170 --> 00:18:07.519
&gt;
 

00:18:07.519 --> 00:18:11.539
One more time and we need-
we're going to get our third in.

00:18:11.539 --> 00:18:13.420
Ready, sing.
 

00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:25.400
&gt;
 

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:26.700
How sweet it is.
 

00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:27.005
Okay.
 

00:18:27.005 --> 00:18:29.626
So that's sweet-sounding
homophonic texture,

00:18:29.626 --> 00:18:30.970
mostly just chords.
 

00:18:30.970 --> 00:18:32.220
Thanks, Lynda.
 

00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:35.560
Then we can take this and turn
it into something a lot more

00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:38.960
complex with--singing a lot of
lines going their own way.

00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:40.710
This we call polyphony.
 

00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:42.729
We also use the word
"counterpoint"

00:18:42.729 --> 00:18:44.058
sort of synonymous with it.
 

00:18:44.058 --> 00:18:48.106
So part three down there at the
bottom we've got an example of

00:18:48.106 --> 00:18:52.154
polyphony where I take in the
tune and set it against itself a

00:18:52.154 --> 00:18:53.150
little bit.
 

00:18:53.150 --> 00:19:22.920
&gt;
 

00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:26.200
So it's just a lot more
complex, a lot of independent

00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:27.839
lines going on up above.
 

00:19:27.839 --> 00:19:29.569
Think of one line.
 

00:19:29.569 --> 00:19:31.259
Think of a group of lines.
 

00:19:31.259 --> 00:19:32.440
Here's one sound.
 

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:32.890
&gt;
 

00:19:32.890 --> 00:19:35.578
Here's a group of sounds,
&gt;

00:19:35.578 --> 00:19:37.690
different pitches and actually
three different pitches in

00:19:37.690 --> 00:19:39.516
there,
as opposed to just one

00:19:39.516 --> 00:19:42.832
pitch--one pitch,
three pitches or three or four

00:19:42.832 --> 00:19:44.890
pitches,
moving in different ways,

00:19:44.890 --> 00:19:46.990
kind of independent rhythmic
chords,

00:19:46.990 --> 00:19:48.769
so that's the difference
between monophonic,

00:19:48.769 --> 00:19:51.048
homophonic and polyphonic
texture.

00:19:51.048 --> 00:19:53.801
Now we're going to turn--focus
here just a bit more on

00:19:53.801 --> 00:19:56.865
polyphonic texture because there
are two types of polyphonic

00:19:56.865 --> 00:19:57.490
texture.
 

00:19:57.490 --> 00:20:00.940
The first we'll call imitative
polyphonic texture,

00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:03.666
and here in "Amazing
Grace" we really do have

00:20:03.666 --> 00:20:05.890
imitative polyphonic texture
because you--

00:20:05.890 --> 00:20:09.890
as you can see,
we have in the bass--

00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:15.167
there in bar two--the bass
imitating the upper part

00:20:15.167 --> 00:20:18.230
&gt;
 

00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:21.184
and then toward the end there
in bar thirteen &lt;&lt;plays

00:20:21.184 --> 00:20:21.950
piano&gt;&gt;
 

00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:26.180
the bass and I've added an
extra note.

00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:28.509
It occurred to me here I could
take that theme and turn it

00:20:28.509 --> 00:20:30.430
upside down against itself and
it would work.

00:20:30.430 --> 00:20:33.960
&gt;
 

00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:34.173
Yeah.
 

00:20:34.173 --> 00:20:35.720
So that's called musical
inversion.

00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:37.118
Bach would like that.
 

00:20:37.118 --> 00:20:39.450
He likes these kind of mind
games with music.

00:20:39.450 --> 00:20:42.403
So it's complex stuff,
this polyphony or this

00:20:42.403 --> 00:20:43.410
counterpoint.
 

00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:45.900
So this is imitative
counterpoint because there's one

00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:48.200
idea that keeps coming back and
back and back.

00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:51.857
Now there's another kind of
counterpoint called "free

00:20:51.857 --> 00:20:54.874
counterpoint"
where it's highly independent

00:20:54.874 --> 00:20:58.788
lines are sounding but they're
not imitating one another.

00:20:58.788 --> 00:21:01.180
Let's listen to just a section
of this.

00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:02.690
We should have this.
 

00:21:02.690 --> 00:21:05.828
It's Louis Armstrong and we'll
talk more about Louis Armstrong

00:21:05.828 --> 00:21:06.910
as we proceed here.
 

00:21:06.910 --> 00:21:11.162
So listen to a good example of
non-imitative texture,

00:21:11.162 --> 00:21:12.880
polyphonic texture.
 

00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:39.849
&gt;
 

00:21:39.849 --> 00:21:41.940
Pretty cool stuff, huh?
 

00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:44.990
Where was Louis Armstrong from?
 

00:21:44.990 --> 00:21:45.240
Student: Chicago.
 

00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:46.190
Prof: Chicago?
 

00:21:46.190 --> 00:21:49.273
Actually, he did his recordings
in Chicago, but he wasn't from

00:21:49.273 --> 00:21:49.779
Chicago.
 

00:21:49.779 --> 00:21:52.640
Where's the heart and soul of
jazz in America?

00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:54.450
New Orleans. Right. Yeah.
 

00:21:54.450 --> 00:21:56.700
That's why it's so important
culturally for the history of

00:21:56.700 --> 00:21:57.490
the United States.
 

00:21:57.490 --> 00:22:03.205
So what we want to do now is to
begin to think about counting

00:22:03.205 --> 00:22:06.255
measures,
and we're going to do this by

00:22:06.255 --> 00:22:09.538
staying with this piece of Louis
Armstrong here,

00:22:09.538 --> 00:22:14.412
and we need to be able to count
measures so that we can figure

00:22:14.412 --> 00:22:16.490
out the syntax of music.
 

00:22:16.490 --> 00:22:19.563
Music is a language and it is
made up of a syntax,

00:22:19.563 --> 00:22:22.573
and syntax, you know,
consists of phrases and the

00:22:22.573 --> 00:22:25.019
order in which those phrases
occur.

00:22:25.019 --> 00:22:28.048
But maybe even before we can
recognize the syntax of music,

00:22:28.048 --> 00:22:30.190
we have to figure out what a
phrase is.

00:22:30.190 --> 00:22:33.750
So to do that we've got to be
able to count measures.

00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:35.200
How do we do this?
 

00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:37.226
Well, musicians,
again, have developed the

00:22:37.226 --> 00:22:38.608
following sort of process.
 

00:22:38.608 --> 00:22:41.801
Let's say oftentimes orchestral
musicians, they're sitting there

00:22:41.801 --> 00:22:44.893
and they're not playing so they
have to be able to count for a

00:22:44.893 --> 00:22:46.108
long period of time.
 

00:22:46.108 --> 00:22:50.196
So they'd be going along in
this fashion--let's say it's

00:22:50.196 --> 00:22:52.722
duple--one-two,
two-two, three-two,

00:22:52.722 --> 00:22:53.690
four-two.
 

00:22:53.690 --> 00:22:56.589
They're just adding integers on
each down beat.

00:22:56.589 --> 00:22:58.880
It's a very simple idea.
 

00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:04.230
So that's what we're going to
do.

00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:06.338
Think of these poor French horn
players in the orchestra.

00:23:06.338 --> 00:23:09.010
They play so rarely,
and then it's so important when

00:23:09.010 --> 00:23:10.397
they do play,
they'll be out there:

00:23:10.397 --> 00:23:12.346
seventy-eight-two,
seventy-nine-two,

00:23:12.346 --> 00:23:15.838
eighty-two, eighty-one-two--
You've got to count forever.

00:23:15.838 --> 00:23:18.308
We won't have to count quite
that long,

00:23:18.308 --> 00:23:20.538
but even before we count,
we've got to figure out what

00:23:20.538 --> 00:23:23.430
the meter of the music is,
so let's start with that now.

00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:25.980
What's the--Let's go back or I
guess we're going to go to the

00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:26.490
beginning.
 

00:23:26.490 --> 00:23:27.880
What's the meter of this piece?
 

00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:30.809
And then we'll go ahead and
count some measures.

00:23:30.809 --> 00:23:46.490
&gt;
 

00:23:46.490 --> 00:23:47.509
So it's duple meter.
 

00:23:47.509 --> 00:23:49.773
Our brain has got all that
stuff coming in there and we're

00:23:49.773 --> 00:23:51.920
probably focusing a lot on the
bass and "boom,

00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:54.000
boom," the tuba that's
playing there.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:54.980
So let's go on now.
 

00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:57.568
We're going to hear Louis
Armstrong himself play.

00:23:57.568 --> 00:23:59.480
What instrument did Louis
Armstrong play?

00:23:59.480 --> 00:23:59.868
Student: Trumpet.
 

00:23:59.868 --> 00:24:02.547
Prof: Trumpet,
yeah, and he had this wonderful

00:24:02.547 --> 00:24:04.546
rich sound but boy,
it was a big,

00:24:04.546 --> 00:24:08.012
huge sound, kind of the
ultimate in-your-face trumpet

00:24:08.012 --> 00:24:08.680
player.
 

00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:11.922
So we're going to hear a solo
by Louis Armstrong now and let's

00:24:11.922 --> 00:24:13.890
count along once the phrase
begins.

00:24:13.890 --> 00:24:16.000
I'll get you started and then
you count the measures.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:16.599
Here we go.
 

00:24:16.599 --> 00:24:24.799
&gt;
 

00:24:24.799 --> 00:24:32.259
Here we go. Ready.
 

00:24:32.259 --> 00:24:34.289
&gt;
 

00:24:34.289 --> 00:24:37.210
One-two, two-two.
 

00:24:37.210 --> 00:24:46.269
Go ahead.
 

00:24:46.269 --> 00:24:47.548
And then he disappears.
 

00:24:47.548 --> 00:24:49.608
So how many bars did you count
there?

00:24:49.608 --> 00:24:51.700
How long was the phrase that
Louis Armstrong played?

00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:52.779
Student: Eight measures.
 

00:24:52.779 --> 00:24:53.904
Prof: Eight measures?
 

00:24:53.904 --> 00:24:54.990
Everybody agree with that?
 

00:24:54.990 --> 00:24:56.670
Anybody say seven?
 

00:24:56.670 --> 00:24:58.828
Better say eight in music.
 

00:24:58.828 --> 00:25:01.459
Asymmetry is not the norm in
music &lt;&lt;music

00:25:01.459 --> 00:25:02.410
playing&gt;&gt;
 

00:25:02.410 --> 00:25:03.778
so eight's a good bet there.
 

00:25:03.778 --> 00:25:05.690
Let's go back and hear another
solo.

00:25:05.690 --> 00:25:09.298
It's a wonderful clarinet solo
by someone named Johnny Dodds--

00:25:09.298 --> 00:25:11.380
long dead of course--but it's
one of the most beautiful,

00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:15.599
incredible clarinet solos
you'll ever want to hear.

00:25:15.599 --> 00:25:17.690
How long is this solo?
 

00:25:17.690 --> 00:25:20.309
How long is this phrase here by
Johnny Dodds?

00:25:20.309 --> 00:25:22.559
&gt;
 

00:25:22.559 --> 00:25:26.589
Here we go: one-two, two-two.
 

00:25:26.589 --> 00:25:45.809
&gt;
 

00:25:45.809 --> 00:25:46.410
Student: Sixteen.
 

00:25:46.410 --> 00:25:48.690
Prof: Sixteen,
so twice as long,

00:25:48.690 --> 00:25:50.548
but that's sort of good news.
 

00:25:50.548 --> 00:25:54.971
A lot of music is made up of
these two-four and four-four

00:25:54.971 --> 00:25:56.710
sorts of aggregates.
 

00:25:56.710 --> 00:26:01.383
And then we'll just go on to
listen to the end of this where

00:26:01.383 --> 00:26:02.730
everybody's in.
 

00:26:02.730 --> 00:26:06.527
It's hard to know again what
the melody is or what the phrase

00:26:06.527 --> 00:26:07.160
is here.
 

00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:08.598
It's just everybody playing.
 

00:26:08.598 --> 00:26:12.759
Remember: are they using music
here?

00:26:12.759 --> 00:26:15.019
Could these gentlemen read
music?

00:26:15.019 --> 00:26:18.858
It's not clear that this
particular group could.

00:26:18.858 --> 00:26:21.373
It's--I'm sure that Louis
Armstrong would read some music,

00:26:21.373 --> 00:26:24.019
but again it would just get in
the way of what he's doing.

00:26:24.019 --> 00:26:29.108
All of this was aurally
transmitted and aurally taught.

00:26:29.108 --> 00:26:31.019
So let's listen to the end of
it.

00:26:31.019 --> 00:26:32.380
It's called "Willie the
Weeper."

00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:34.440
You're going to have it as one
of your listening exercises.

00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:37.150
Let's listen to the end of it
here.

00:26:37.150 --> 00:26:40.549
&gt;
 

00:26:40.549 --> 00:26:42.700
Now here we go with our phrase.
 

00:26:42.700 --> 00:27:06.480
&gt;
 

00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:09.029
We used to call that
in--remember when--anybody in

00:27:09.029 --> 00:27:10.278
high school band here?
 

00:27:10.278 --> 00:27:12.152
What do you call that
"boom"

00:27:12.152 --> 00:27:12.808
at the end?
 

00:27:12.808 --> 00:27:14.784
Do you still call it that,
"stinger"

00:27:14.784 --> 00:27:17.065
at the end, sort of a
syncopated bounce at the end of

00:27:17.065 --> 00:27:17.680
the thing?
 

00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:19.798
How long was that particular
phrase?

00:27:19.798 --> 00:27:23.007
Sixteen bars there,
again, and a perfect example of

00:27:23.007 --> 00:27:24.288
free counterpoint.
 

00:27:24.288 --> 00:27:25.885
You've got the trombone,
the clarinet,

00:27:25.885 --> 00:27:26.490
the trumpet.
 

00:27:26.490 --> 00:27:30.182
They're all just doing their
own thing in the context of the

00:27:30.182 --> 00:27:33.874
harmonies that are playing out
here, and it's just magical I

00:27:33.874 --> 00:27:34.500
think.
 

00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:36.108
What happy music. Right?
 

00:27:36.108 --> 00:27:39.367
How could you possibly be sad
when listening to that kind of

00:27:39.367 --> 00:27:39.808
music?
 

00:27:39.808 --> 00:27:42.950
And then they play this kind of
music coming back from funerals.

00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:44.700
You're dancing in to heaven.
 

00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:46.118
It's that kind of thing, yeah.
 

00:27:46.118 --> 00:27:48.410
I bet there's heavenly music of
that sort.

00:27:48.410 --> 00:27:49.630
Okay.
 

00:27:49.630 --> 00:27:52.727
Now let's go on to another
thing that we'll want to be

00:27:52.727 --> 00:27:56.292
doing here and that I guess is
taking a little bit of rhythmic

00:27:56.292 --> 00:27:59.896
dictation,
writing down some simple

00:27:59.896 --> 00:28:00.920
rhythms.
 

00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:02.319
How are we going to do this?
 

00:28:02.319 --> 00:28:06.000
Why do we want to do this?
 

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.038
Because we want to remember
things.

00:28:08.038 --> 00:28:12.910
Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart had a
very good musical memory.

00:28:12.910 --> 00:28:15.528
There are lots of stories about
Mozart's musical memory.

00:28:15.528 --> 00:28:19.380
In 1777, he was in the town of
Mannheim.

00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:23.509
He heard a string quartet by a
man named Cambini.

00:28:23.509 --> 00:28:24.839
It was never published.
 

00:28:24.839 --> 00:28:26.269
There are no recordings of it.
 

00:28:26.269 --> 00:28:27.598
Mozart goes to Paris.
 

00:28:27.598 --> 00:28:29.869
About six months later he bumps
into Cambini.

00:28:29.869 --> 00:28:31.380
He says, "Oh, Cambini.
 

00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:32.269
I remember you.
 

00:28:32.269 --> 00:28:35.220
We--I heard your string quartet
in Mannheim."

00:28:35.220 --> 00:28:38.298
And he sits down at the piano
and plays the thing.

00:28:38.298 --> 00:28:40.730
He didn't have-he wasn't
studying this thing.

00:28:40.730 --> 00:28:41.940
He wasn't trying to memorize it.
 

00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:43.130
He heard it just once.
 

00:28:43.130 --> 00:28:45.471
Six months later he could
remember the whole movement of a

00:28:45.471 --> 00:28:46.170
string quartet.
 

00:28:46.170 --> 00:28:50.337
Another famous story:
In 1770, he goes in to Rome,

00:28:50.337 --> 00:28:52.549
into the Sistine Chapel.
 

00:28:52.549 --> 00:28:53.318
It's Holy Week.
 

00:28:53.318 --> 00:28:58.345
He goes to hear the well-known
Miserere of Allegri,

00:28:58.345 --> 00:29:00.019
Gregorio Allegri.
 

00:29:00.019 --> 00:29:03.401
You're not supposed to copy
this piece because it's supposed

00:29:03.401 --> 00:29:05.980
to be only performed in the
Sistine Chapel.

00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:08.230
Mozart goes in.
 

00:29:08.230 --> 00:29:09.009
He hears it.
 

00:29:09.009 --> 00:29:11.910
He and his father walk back to
the inn where they are staying.

00:29:11.910 --> 00:29:15.047
He writes down this four- to
five-minute composition note for

00:29:15.047 --> 00:29:16.460
note in just one sitting.
 

00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:18.519
That's pretty scary.
 

00:29:18.519 --> 00:29:19.608
Wouldn't it be?
 

00:29:19.608 --> 00:29:22.327
I--You're just off on a
different planet in terms of

00:29:22.327 --> 00:29:25.420
your capacity to process aural
material, but we--I can't do

00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:25.900
that.
 

00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:27.029
I couldn't begin to do that.
 

00:29:27.029 --> 00:29:28.000
How much can I hear?
 

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:29.000
Two seconds,
three seconds,

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:29.579
four seconds.
 

00:29:29.579 --> 00:29:31.140
I could probably remember that.
 

00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:33.548
And he's hearing multiple
parts, not just melody.

00:29:33.548 --> 00:29:36.348
So we have to come up--we
mortals--

00:29:36.348 --> 00:29:38.450
have to come up with some other
device,

00:29:38.450 --> 00:29:41.489
and our device to remember
things is to try to write it

00:29:41.489 --> 00:29:45.040
down because my premise here is,
if you can write music down

00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:48.603
clearly you are hearing it,
clearly, and you would have a

00:29:48.603 --> 00:29:52.460
better chance of remembering it
if you could write it down.

00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:55.808
So it just helps us focus on
these isolated events.

00:29:55.808 --> 00:29:58.262
We're not going to try to
remember everything in

00:29:58.262 --> 00:29:59.358
music--too complex.
 

00:29:59.358 --> 00:30:02.506
We're going to focus on the
simple, salient things--could be

00:30:02.506 --> 00:30:04.960
an instrument,
could be an important rhythm.

00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:08.314
So let's listen to some more
music of Musorgsky here,

00:30:08.314 --> 00:30:09.538
Modest Musorgsky.
 

00:30:09.538 --> 00:30:12.720
We had that very interesting
piece last time,

00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:17.248
"Polish Oxcart"
where he used this principle of

00:30:17.248 --> 00:30:22.019
low sounds produce sound waves
that stay forever and we hear

00:30:22.019 --> 00:30:24.930
those low sounds first and last.
 

00:30:24.930 --> 00:30:27.240
So here we're going to hear
another piece from that

00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:28.858
Pictures at an
Exhibition.

00:30:28.858 --> 00:30:31.656
It's called "Great Gate of
Kiev" so let's listen to a

00:30:31.656 --> 00:30:33.901
little of this,
1874, I believe,

00:30:33.901 --> 00:30:38.106
or 1870s surely,
and let's listen to a bit of it

00:30:38.106 --> 00:30:42.759
and then we're going to focus
just on the rhythm.

00:30:42.759 --> 00:30:53.740
&gt;
 

00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:56.759
Okay. Start conducting.
 

00:30:56.759 --> 00:31:11.200
&gt;
 

00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:12.460
All right. Good.
 

00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:14.098
Very interesting.
 

00:31:14.098 --> 00:31:17.150
There are two possible
explanations to this.

00:31:17.150 --> 00:31:21.990
Some of you are going with a
very slow tempo:

00:31:21.990 --> 00:31:24.078
one-two, one-two.
 

00:31:24.078 --> 00:31:25.755
Others are a bit uncomfortable
with that,

00:31:25.755 --> 00:31:26.759
&gt;.
 

00:31:26.759 --> 00:31:28.839
They're going twice as fast.
 

00:31:28.839 --> 00:31:29.769
Which is correct?
 

00:31:29.769 --> 00:31:32.960
Well, for our purposes,
both are correct and we'll know

00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:34.970
how to figure this out on tests.
 

00:31:34.970 --> 00:31:37.743
If you say--you've got two
measures here and you're writing

00:31:37.743 --> 00:31:40.088
particular symbols,
we'll know that you heard this

00:31:40.088 --> 00:31:41.618
with the slower possibility.
 

00:31:41.618 --> 00:31:44.107
If you've got four measures and
different symbols,

00:31:44.107 --> 00:31:47.053
you're clearly subdividing the
beat but hearing that as the

00:31:47.053 --> 00:31:47.509
beat.
 

00:31:47.509 --> 00:31:52.705
So all I'm really interested in
here is the idea that we have a

00:31:52.705 --> 00:31:53.880
duple meter.
 

00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:58.133
Having said that,
let's assume that we do have

00:31:58.133 --> 00:32:02.952
the slower tempo here,
one--Let me play a little bit

00:32:02.952 --> 00:32:04.559
at the piano.
 

00:32:04.559 --> 00:32:10.990
&gt;
 

00:32:10.990 --> 00:32:14.380
So your hand should be moving
rather slowly.

00:32:14.380 --> 00:32:15.390
Let's all sing it.
 

00:32:15.390 --> 00:32:23.569
&gt;
 

00:32:23.569 --> 00:32:24.829
Okay.
 

00:32:24.829 --> 00:32:26.200
So that's the music.
 

00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:30.056
Now having done this setup,
if you think about it,

00:32:30.056 --> 00:32:34.384
and think about the fact
that--what note symbol gets the

00:32:34.384 --> 00:32:37.769
beat in our course--quarter
note, okay.

00:32:37.769 --> 00:32:39.390
&gt;
 

00:32:39.390 --> 00:32:42.932
So every gesture of the hand is
going to be the equivalent of a

00:32:42.932 --> 00:32:43.788
quarter note.
 

00:32:43.788 --> 00:32:45.829
What's going to be my first
note symbol?

00:32:45.829 --> 00:32:48.609
&gt;
 

00:32:48.609 --> 00:32:49.319
The half note.
 

00:32:49.319 --> 00:32:51.960
Here's one gesture;
here's another gesture.

00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:56.609
&gt;
 

00:32:56.609 --> 00:32:57.619
Okay?
 

00:32:57.619 --> 00:32:59.250
So I've got you going there.
 

00:32:59.250 --> 00:33:00.608
You take your piece of paper
now.

00:33:00.608 --> 00:33:02.913
If you want to hum the piece
quietly to yourself,

00:33:02.913 --> 00:33:04.210
that's fine;
that's good.

00:33:04.210 --> 00:33:05.750
If I hear lots of buzzing out
there,

00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:08.357
that means you're into it,
so hum the piece a little bit

00:33:08.357 --> 00:33:11.727
to yourself,
Musorgsky's "Great Gate of

00:33:11.727 --> 00:33:17.040
Kiev" here and Pictures
at an Exhibition and see if

00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:21.069
you can write down those
particular symbols.

00:33:21.069 --> 00:33:25.759
&gt;
 

00:33:25.759 --> 00:33:39.720
 
 

00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:41.809
Okay. Let's sing it again.
 

00:33:41.809 --> 00:33:42.470
Here we go.
 

00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:43.609
Ready, go.
 

00:33:43.609 --> 00:33:51.660
&gt;
 

00:33:51.660 --> 00:33:55.529
Let's focus
&gt;

00:33:55.529 --> 00:33:57.210
just on that unit, that measure.
 

00:33:57.210 --> 00:33:58.950
&gt;
 

00:33:58.950 --> 00:34:00.420
Having trouble with this?
 

00:34:00.420 --> 00:34:01.220
Look at this.
 

00:34:01.220 --> 00:34:03.769
&gt;
 

00:34:03.769 --> 00:34:07.099
One gesture,
two notes, two pitches.

00:34:07.099 --> 00:34:08.239
&gt;
 

00:34:08.239 --> 00:34:11.148
What should those--what should
the rhythmic value of those two

00:34:11.148 --> 00:34:11.769
pitches be?
 

00:34:11.769 --> 00:34:13.409
&gt;
 

00:34:13.409 --> 00:34:16.960
Yeah, two within one beat would
give us eighth notes.

00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:17.282
Okay.
 

00:34:17.282 --> 00:34:19.739
So let's finish it off one more
time.

00:34:19.739 --> 00:34:21.030
Here we go. Ready, go.
 

00:34:21.030 --> 00:34:28.539
&gt;
 

00:34:28.539 --> 00:34:30.650
So what should we write up here?
 

00:34:30.650 --> 00:34:33.039
I lost my black marker but that
doesn't matter.

00:34:33.039 --> 00:34:38.610
&gt;
 

00:34:38.610 --> 00:34:40.159
What should I write next?
 

00:34:40.159 --> 00:34:42.489
Well, those are the two eighth
notes we were talking about.

00:34:42.489 --> 00:34:43.570
&gt;
 

00:34:43.570 --> 00:34:45.860
Then what?
 

00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:48.320
&gt;
 

00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:51.831
One note for each gesture and
we've just done a rhythmic

00:34:51.831 --> 00:34:55.664
dictation of the beginning of
Musorgsky's "Great Gate of

00:34:55.664 --> 00:34:59.050
Kiev" from Pictures at
an Exhibition.

00:34:59.050 --> 00:35:02.264
So you're not going to forget
this particular melody and it's

00:35:02.264 --> 00:35:03.820
because it sounds so grand.
 

00:35:03.820 --> 00:35:05.818
There's another reason we're
not going to forget it,

00:35:05.818 --> 00:35:07.309
if you've focused on it in that
way.

00:35:07.309 --> 00:35:10.760
So when later on we're dealing
with symphonies and things like

00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:13.760
that you may be sketching little
motivic snippets,

00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:15.599
little rhythmic snippets,
that you'll file away.

00:35:15.599 --> 00:35:16.188
All right.
 

00:35:16.188 --> 00:35:19.778
Let's listen a little bit more
to the Musorgsky and then we're

00:35:19.778 --> 00:35:22.251
going to go on,
just a bit more to the next

00:35:22.251 --> 00:35:24.900
excerpt, and here's my question
for you.

00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:28.257
You're going to hear the
violins play a running scale,

00:35:28.257 --> 00:35:29.780
&gt;.
 

00:35:29.780 --> 00:35:34.679
If our beat is this,
&gt;

00:35:34.679 --> 00:35:38.731
what note values are in the
music of the violinists at this

00:35:38.731 --> 00:35:40.130
particular moment?
 

00:35:40.130 --> 00:35:42.070
You don't even have to see the
score.

00:35:42.070 --> 00:35:43.409
You can figure it out.
 

00:35:43.409 --> 00:36:01.110
&gt;
 

00:36:01.110 --> 00:36:03.929
So what note value are they
playing there?

00:36:03.929 --> 00:36:04.699
Student: Sixteenth.
 

00:36:04.699 --> 00:36:07.927
Prof: Sixteenth because
we've got four impulses

00:36:07.927 --> 00:36:09.329
&gt;
 

00:36:09.329 --> 00:36:10.159
for each beat.
 

00:36:10.159 --> 00:36:12.860
Let's go on to the next here
now--a couple of questions we

00:36:12.860 --> 00:36:13.429
could ask.
 

00:36:13.429 --> 00:36:15.210
The theme comes back.
 

00:36:15.210 --> 00:36:16.349
We're going to listen to it
again.

00:36:16.349 --> 00:36:20.947
What string technique are the
violins using at this particular

00:36:20.947 --> 00:36:24.489
moment and then &lt;&lt;music
playing&gt;&gt;

00:36:24.489 --> 00:36:28.409
what rhythmic device does the
trumpet insert?

00:36:28.409 --> 00:36:30.059
So let's focus on the strings
first.

00:36:30.059 --> 00:36:31.510
We may hear this twice.
 

00:36:31.510 --> 00:36:43.670
&gt;
 

00:36:43.670 --> 00:36:45.530
Okay. What are they doing there?
 

00:36:45.530 --> 00:36:46.750
What are they playing there?
 

00:36:46.750 --> 00:36:47.690
Student: Tremolo?
 

00:36:47.690 --> 00:36:49.664
Prof: Tremolo,
just kind of filler.

00:36:49.664 --> 00:36:50.050
Right?
 

00:36:50.050 --> 00:36:52.050
We need a big sound here.
 

00:36:52.050 --> 00:36:54.420
Let's get the violins to fill
in sonic space.

00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:56.538
It's kind of--there must be
something in cooking like

00:36:56.538 --> 00:36:58.617
that--use cornstarch or
something, a filler--I don't

00:36:58.617 --> 00:37:00.409
know--just to make--give
something body.

00:37:00.409 --> 00:37:02.639
So this is kind of giving the
music body here.

00:37:02.639 --> 00:37:05.090
It's not of particular interest
melodically.

00:37:05.090 --> 00:37:08.449
Now when the trumpet enters
something of interest happens.

00:37:08.449 --> 00:37:10.889
What rhythmic device is the
trumpet inserting?

00:37:10.889 --> 00:37:12.239
So let's go back to the same
spot.

00:37:12.239 --> 00:37:15.260
We'll hear the tremolo and then
the trumpet.

00:37:15.260 --> 00:37:15.639
Here we go.
 

00:37:15.639 --> 00:37:21.610
Notice the tempo is slowed down
a bit here also.

00:37:21.610 --> 00:37:31.829
 
 

00:37:31.829 --> 00:37:59.750
&gt;
 

00:37:59.750 --> 00:38:02.440
So what did the trumpet insert,
what rhythmic device?

00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:02.907
Student: Triplets..
 

00:38:02.907 --> 00:38:03.340
Prof: Triplets.
 

00:38:03.340 --> 00:38:07.380
&gt;
 

00:38:07.380 --> 00:38:11.606
So focusing on rhythm can tell
us a lot about the detail going

00:38:11.606 --> 00:38:15.349
on in pop music or in classical
music in particular.

00:38:15.349 --> 00:38:18.594
Now I'd like to end--I think I
have a few minutes here--I'd

00:38:18.594 --> 00:38:20.719
like to end with a particular
piece.

00:38:20.719 --> 00:38:23.693
We've talked about Mozart
before and we're going to go on

00:38:23.693 --> 00:38:26.030
now to talk about Mozart's
Requiem.

00:38:26.030 --> 00:38:27.639
It's a Requiem mass.
 

00:38:27.639 --> 00:38:28.440
What's a mass?
 

00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:30.590
Well, a mass is a genre of
music.

00:38:30.590 --> 00:38:33.148
Obviously, it's a religious
service as well,

00:38:33.148 --> 00:38:36.840
but it's a genre of music like
the symphony or the concerto.

00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:40.195
Bach wrote a mass,
Mozart wrote many masses,

00:38:40.195 --> 00:38:44.019
Beethoven wrote two important
masses and so on.

00:38:44.019 --> 00:38:45.469
So it's a genre of music.
 

00:38:45.469 --> 00:38:49.340
The Requiem mass is a
particular kind of mass.

00:38:49.340 --> 00:38:52.177
It's a mass,
obviously, for death and burial

00:38:52.177 --> 00:38:55.280
and the commemoration of those
who have died.

00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:59.679
Unlike the regular mass,
the Requiem mass has a very

00:38:59.679 --> 00:39:02.960
special movement associated with
it.

00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:05.365
It's called the "Dies
irae"--the "Day of

00:39:05.365 --> 00:39:05.989
Wrath."
 

00:39:05.989 --> 00:39:09.068
It's just a long,
long text that's set to music

00:39:09.068 --> 00:39:12.414
but that text is drawn from
"Apocalypse,"

00:39:12.414 --> 00:39:15.159
the images of
"Apocalypse."

00:39:15.159 --> 00:39:17.489
If you ever read the Book of
Apocalypse--

00:39:17.489 --> 00:39:20.110
or Revelation--you know it's
hellfire and brimstone,

00:39:20.110 --> 00:39:23.603
the day of judgment,
damnation--election into the

00:39:23.603 --> 00:39:25.750
group of the blessed,
and so on.

00:39:25.750 --> 00:39:30.449
So it's a very vivid kind of
text.

00:39:30.449 --> 00:39:33.090
Now I was going to put that
text up on the board and,

00:39:33.090 --> 00:39:35.030
to be honest with you,
I forgot to do that,

00:39:35.030 --> 00:39:37.409
so I'm going to have to see if
I can remember this text:

00:39:37.409 --> 00:39:41.641
We're going to focus now on two
sections of this work:

00:39:41.641 --> 00:39:45.952
the "Confutatis"
and the "Lacrimosa dies

00:39:45.952 --> 00:39:47.150
illa."
 

00:39:47.150 --> 00:39:50.929
They are both subsets of the
"Dies irae."

00:39:50.929 --> 00:39:54.860
The "Confutatis" go--
The text is as follows:

00:39:54.860 --> 00:39:58.074
"Confutatis maledictis,
voca--voca--me cum

00:39:58.074 --> 00:39:59.789
benedictis."
 

00:39:59.789 --> 00:40:02.902
So on one side here we've got
the "confutatis

00:40:02.902 --> 00:40:04.110
maledictis."
 

00:40:04.110 --> 00:40:05.219
These are the damned.
 

00:40:05.219 --> 00:40:08.516
On the other side,
we've got "voca--voca me

00:40:08.516 --> 00:40:10.130
cum benedictis."
 

00:40:10.130 --> 00:40:14.610
These are the blessed. Okay?
 

00:40:14.610 --> 00:40:16.389
Ever been to a medieval
cathedral?

00:40:16.389 --> 00:40:19.090
You walk in the front door,
Christ in majesty--

00:40:19.090 --> 00:40:23.005
on the left side are the damned
writhing and on the right side

00:40:23.005 --> 00:40:25.960
are the blessed looking a good
deal happier.

00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:29.630
So Mozart may have had this
image in mind of the damned and

00:40:29.630 --> 00:40:31.972
the left,
but he sure was able to set

00:40:31.972 --> 00:40:34.827
it--this text--
through music by using a couple

00:40:34.827 --> 00:40:35.570
of devices.
 

00:40:35.570 --> 00:40:38.606
The first of these is rhythmic,
so we're going to turn now--I

00:40:38.606 --> 00:40:41.492
guess we'll turn off the lights
and we're going to go to a

00:40:41.492 --> 00:40:42.809
couple of slides here.
 

00:40:42.809 --> 00:40:47.800
Let's take a look at the rhythm
he associates with the damned.

00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:51.719
What kind of rhythm do we get
with the damned?

00:40:51.719 --> 00:40:54.409
Well, where would you expect to
find the damned?

00:40:54.409 --> 00:40:56.000
In the high register or the low
registers?

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:58.518
The low registers,
and they're way down in the

00:40:58.518 --> 00:41:00.869
twenty-ninth canto of hell or
somewhere.

00:41:00.869 --> 00:41:05.034
So here's what we find,
and as you can see there--is

00:41:05.034 --> 00:41:08.630
this bass rhythm moving slowly
or quickly?

00:41:08.630 --> 00:41:10.289
Very quickly.
 

00:41:10.289 --> 00:41:24.280
It's going like this
&gt;

00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:25.159
and so on.
 

00:41:25.159 --> 00:41:26.340
It's also doing what?
 

00:41:26.340 --> 00:41:27.889
Going up or down?
 

00:41:27.889 --> 00:41:28.532
Student: Up..
 

00:41:28.532 --> 00:41:29.110
Prof: Up.
 

00:41:29.110 --> 00:41:30.409
It keeps rising up.
 

00:41:30.409 --> 00:41:31.309
This builds tension.
 

00:41:31.309 --> 00:41:32.260
Okay?
 

00:41:32.260 --> 00:41:34.369
Are these happy folks singing
there?

00:41:34.369 --> 00:41:35.449
Well, they've got this kind of
music.

00:41:35.449 --> 00:41:39.630
&gt;
 

00:41:39.630 --> 00:41:42.516
Is this conjunct
music--step-wise music--or

00:41:42.516 --> 00:41:44.030
jumpy, skippy music?
 

00:41:44.030 --> 00:41:45.460
Pretty skippy.
 

00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:47.809
And is it consonant music or
dissonant music?

00:41:47.809 --> 00:41:49.929
&gt;
 

00:41:49.929 --> 00:41:51.699
Very dissonant music.
 

00:41:51.699 --> 00:41:53.550
Is it major or minor?
 

00:41:53.550 --> 00:41:54.260
&gt;
 

00:41:54.260 --> 00:41:55.659
Minor.
 

00:41:55.659 --> 00:41:57.333
Okay, so I'd say he's got about
four things he's working with

00:41:57.333 --> 00:41:57.530
here.
 

00:41:57.530 --> 00:41:59.190
The rhythm is very important.
 

00:41:59.190 --> 00:42:03.018
Now eventually the elect come
in.

00:42:03.018 --> 00:42:05.099
And their rhythm--what do they
have?

00:42:05.099 --> 00:42:06.369
Are they high or low?
 

00:42:06.369 --> 00:42:07.110
Well, they're way up high.
 

00:42:07.110 --> 00:42:08.836
You can see them in the
sopranos and altos up there

00:42:08.836 --> 00:42:09.840
&gt;
 

00:42:09.840 --> 00:42:13.778
and they just sit there on that
pitch--a long note:

00:42:13.778 --> 00:42:15.670
one, two, three,
four.

00:42:15.670 --> 00:42:18.230
&gt;
 

00:42:18.230 --> 00:42:19.559
I don't have the next page.
 

00:42:19.559 --> 00:42:26.610
&gt;
 

00:42:26.610 --> 00:42:27.599
That's what they do.
 

00:42:27.599 --> 00:42:29.635
It's consonant,
it's in major,

00:42:29.635 --> 00:42:31.672
it's high and,
most important,

00:42:31.672 --> 00:42:34.269
the rhythm is very
uncomplicated.

00:42:34.269 --> 00:42:35.809
The notes are long and slow.
 

00:42:35.809 --> 00:42:39.943
So let's listen to Mozart's
depiction of hell and heaven

00:42:39.943 --> 00:42:40.469
here.
 

00:42:40.469 --> 00:43:01.670
&gt;
 

00:43:01.670 --> 00:43:02.730
Heaven.
 

00:43:02.730 --> 00:43:25.380
&gt;
 

00:43:25.380 --> 00:43:28.800
And then he goes back to hell
and then back up to heaven--goes

00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:32.110
back and forth between these two
rhythmically very different

00:43:32.110 --> 00:43:32.840
concepts.
 

00:43:32.840 --> 00:43:36.969
Now Mozart died in December,
1791.

00:43:36.969 --> 00:43:38.199
He wasn't planning on dying.
 

00:43:38.199 --> 00:43:41.416
Actually, his death came rather
suddenly and he was working on a

00:43:41.416 --> 00:43:44.019
requiem that someone had
commissioned from him under

00:43:44.019 --> 00:43:47.135
rather mysterious circumstances
and he began to think of it as

00:43:47.135 --> 00:43:52.552
his own requiem,
and indeed, he didn't actually

00:43:52.552 --> 00:43:54.110
finish it.
 

00:43:54.110 --> 00:43:57.050
Here, from the Austrian
National Library where I was

00:43:57.050 --> 00:44:00.340
last summer photographing and
having a wonderful time,

00:44:00.340 --> 00:44:04.199
is the last page of the
Mozart--that Mozart ever wrote

00:44:04.199 --> 00:44:04.710
here.
 

00:44:04.710 --> 00:44:06.405
This is the
"Lacrimosa,"

00:44:06.405 --> 00:44:09.025
and sort of breaking off--and
he doesn't finish this

00:44:09.025 --> 00:44:10.260
particular movement.
 

00:44:10.260 --> 00:44:12.050
It's the last movement that he
was working on,

00:44:12.050 --> 00:44:14.610
but he has a student there,
Franz Xaver Suessmayr,

00:44:14.610 --> 00:44:17.891
and Suessmayr was given
instructions and probably

00:44:17.891 --> 00:44:20.849
sketched pages as well,
as to how to finish this.

00:44:20.849 --> 00:44:24.079
So Mozart was able to finish it
and it looks--or--excuse me.

00:44:24.079 --> 00:44:27.369
Suessmayr was able to finish
it, and it looks like this.

00:44:27.369 --> 00:44:31.215
Here we have a score of it--of
the complete piece,

00:44:31.215 --> 00:44:36.083
and there are just a couple of
details that I want to point out

00:44:36.083 --> 00:44:36.789
here.
 

00:44:36.789 --> 00:44:40.748
It begins with what I always
hear as a kind of funeral

00:44:40.748 --> 00:44:41.869
cortege idea.
 

00:44:41.869 --> 00:44:43.309
Of course, it's in minor
&gt;

00:44:43.309 --> 00:44:49.226
and the voices will come in,
but the bass is going,

00:44:49.226 --> 00:44:52.659
&gt;
 

00:44:52.659 --> 00:44:56.762
sort of plodding along in a
basic duple but with a triple

00:44:56.762 --> 00:44:59.179
subdivision underneath of that.
 

00:44:59.179 --> 00:45:01.820
And then at the words you can
see--

00:45:01.820 --> 00:45:05.492
well, maybe you can't see--but
the text is "On that

00:45:05.492 --> 00:45:10.039
terrible sorrowful day"--
we have the words--where is

00:45:10.039 --> 00:45:13.880
it?--"Qua resurget ex
favilla"--

00:45:13.880 --> 00:45:16.789
"on which resurgent will
come forth--

00:45:16.789 --> 00:45:19.170
resurgent, will come up out of
the ashes."

00:45:19.170 --> 00:45:22.625
"Homo reus,"--
"the just person to be

00:45:22.625 --> 00:45:26.050
judged,"
and notice how it's like the

00:45:26.050 --> 00:45:30.893
coffin's opening up and here
comes Mozart's soprano line up

00:45:30.893 --> 00:45:31.730
here.
 

00:45:31.730 --> 00:45:38.710
&gt;
 

00:45:38.710 --> 00:45:38.967
Wow.
 

00:45:38.967 --> 00:45:42.460
What a run, but it's all kind
of text depiction here.

00:45:42.460 --> 00:45:49.715
And then in the next page he's
going to take that same rising

00:45:49.715 --> 00:45:53.949
line and assign it to the
basses.

00:45:53.949 --> 00:45:56.619
Then we have a change of text
here.

00:45:56.619 --> 00:46:00.012
"Huic ergo parce,
Deus," "Therefore

00:46:00.012 --> 00:46:01.260
save, God."
 

00:46:01.260 --> 00:46:02.876
"Parce"
;--imperative--"save

00:46:02.876 --> 00:46:03.309
us."
 

00:46:03.309 --> 00:46:06.289
"Pie Jesu,
Jesu Domine,"

00:46:06.289 --> 00:46:11.528
and at that text what he does
is shift from this dark minor

00:46:11.528 --> 00:46:14.329
&gt;
 

00:46:14.329 --> 00:46:18.057
right over the words
"Jesu,"

00:46:18.057 --> 00:46:22.289
he's already &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:46:22.289 --> 00:46:25.750
in a sweet major,
and then he'll work his way

00:46:25.750 --> 00:46:28.659
back to &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:46:28.659 --> 00:46:31.378
the minor as the funeral
cortege continues,

00:46:31.378 --> 00:46:35.199
and this time the line will go
down instead of rising up.

00:46:35.199 --> 00:46:40.550
So this goes on for a while.
 

00:46:40.550 --> 00:46:42.405
We're going to start--we're
going to listen to the entire

00:46:42.405 --> 00:46:42.768
movement.
 

00:46:42.768 --> 00:46:46.889
It runs about our minutes so
bear with me here.

00:46:46.889 --> 00:46:50.909
We'll run about thirty seconds
over as we listen to the

00:46:50.909 --> 00:46:54.036
"Lacrimosa"
out of the "Dies

00:46:54.036 --> 00:46:58.505
irae" out of the Requiem
Mass of Wolfgang Amadeus

00:46:58.505 --> 00:47:01.929
Mozart written in Vienna
seventeen 1791.

00:47:01.929 --> 00:48:06.230
&gt;
 

00:48:06.230 --> 00:48:07.389
Okay, cortege.
 

00:48:07.389 --> 00:48:22.170
&gt;
 

00:48:22.170 --> 00:48:23.309
Now the basses.
 

00:48:23.309 --> 00:48:55.230
&gt;
 

00:48:55.230 --> 00:48:56.730
Now the quiet prayer.
 

00:48:56.730 --> 00:49:12.289
&gt;
 

00:49:12.289 --> 00:49:14.090
Change to major.
 

00:49:14.090 --> 00:49:31.139
&gt;
 

00:49:31.139 --> 00:49:36.409
Now the modulation--change of
key from major to--back to minor

00:49:36.409 --> 00:49:40.469
as the cortege will start up
again and then we--

00:49:40.469 --> 00:49:43.320
&gt;
 

00:49:43.320 --> 00:49:47.650
A nice clarinet sound there and
here comes our cortege with the

00:49:47.650 --> 00:49:48.139
bass.
 

00:49:48.139 --> 00:50:44.400
&gt;
 

00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:48.389
Now just a final close,
a cadence.

00:50:48.389 --> 00:51:11.110
&gt;
 

00:51:11.110 --> 00:51:15.030
So that's the last music of
Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and his

00:51:15.030 --> 00:51:17.467
pupil,
Suessmayr, and--not to leave

00:51:17.467 --> 00:51:20.175
you in a somber mood--
let's listen to Louis Armstrong

00:51:20.175 --> 00:51:20.681
as we go out.
 

00:51:20.681 --> 00:51:20.876
Okay?
 

00:51:20.876 --> 00:51:21.849
&gt;
 

00:51:21.849 --> 00:51:23.280
Dancing to heaven.
 

00:51:23.280 --> 00:51:29.000

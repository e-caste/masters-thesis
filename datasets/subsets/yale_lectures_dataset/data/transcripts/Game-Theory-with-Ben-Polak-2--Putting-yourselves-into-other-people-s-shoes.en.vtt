00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:05.576
Professor Ben Polak:
Okay, so last time we looked at

00:00:05.576 --> 00:00:08.805
and played this game.
You had to choose grades,

00:00:08.805 --> 00:00:12.740
so you had to choose Alpha and
Beta, and this table told us

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:15.410
what outcome would arise.
In particular,

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:18.770
what grade you would get and
what grade your pair would get.

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:21.771
So, for example,
if you had chosen Beta and your

00:00:21.771 --> 00:00:25.157
pair had chosen Alpha,
then you would get a C and your

00:00:25.157 --> 00:00:28.152
pair would get an A.
One of the first things we

00:00:28.152 --> 00:00:31.020
pointed out, is that this is not
quite a game yet.

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:35.319
It's missing something.
This has outcomes in it,

00:00:35.319 --> 00:00:40.533
it's an outcome matrix,
but it isn't a game,

00:00:40.533 --> 00:00:46.110
because for a game we need to
know payoffs.

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.390
Then we looked at some possible
payoffs, and now it is a game.

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.888
So this is a game,
just to give you some more

00:00:51.888 --> 00:00:53.990
jargon, this is a normal-form
game.

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:57.442
And here we've assumed the
payoffs are those that arise if

00:00:57.442 --> 00:01:00.955
players only care about their
own grades, which I think was

00:01:00.955 --> 00:01:03.583
true for a lot of you.
It wasn't true for the

00:01:03.583 --> 00:01:06.407
gentleman who's sitting there
now, but it was true for a lot

00:01:06.407 --> 00:01:08.033
of people.
We pointed out,

00:01:08.033 --> 00:01:11.380
that in this game,
Alpha strictly dominates Beta.

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.694
What do we mean by that?
We mean that if these are your

00:01:14.694 --> 00:01:18.993
payoffs, no matter what your
pair does, you attain a higher

00:01:18.993 --> 00:01:23.590
payoff from choosing Alpha,
than you do from choosing Beta.

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.031
Let's focus on a couple of
lessons of the class before I

00:01:26.031 --> 00:01:28.365
come back to this.
One lesson was,

00:01:28.365 --> 00:01:32.510
do not play a strictly
dominated strategy.

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:35.150
Everybody remember that lesson?
Then much later on,

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.852
when we looked at some more
complicated payoffs and a more

00:01:37.852 --> 00:01:40.989
complicated game,
we looked at a different lesson

00:01:40.989 --> 00:01:44.098
which was this:
put yourself in others' shoes

00:01:44.098 --> 00:01:47.629
to try and figure out what
they're going to do.

00:01:47.629 --> 00:01:49.581
So in fact, what we learned
from that is,

00:01:49.581 --> 00:01:52.166
it doesn't just matter what
your payoffs are -- that's

00:01:52.166 --> 00:01:55.141
obviously important -- it's also
important what other people's

00:01:55.141 --> 00:01:57.543
payoffs are,
because you want to try and

00:01:57.543 --> 00:02:00.420
figure out what they're going to
do and then respond

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.414
appropriately.
So we're going to return to

00:02:03.414 --> 00:02:07.724
both of these lessons today.
Both of these lessons will

00:02:07.724 --> 00:02:11.071
reoccur today.
Now, a lot of today is going to

00:02:11.071 --> 00:02:14.288
be fairly abstract,
so I just want to remind you

00:02:14.288 --> 00:02:17.710
that Game Theory has some real
world relevance.

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:21.123
Again, still in the interest of
recapping, this particular game

00:02:21.123 --> 00:02:23.050
is called the Prisoners'
Dilemma.

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.290
It's written there,
the Prisoners' Dilemma.

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.720
Notice, it's Prisoners, plural.
And we mentioned some examples

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.557
last time.
Let me just reiterate and

00:02:31.557 --> 00:02:34.149
mention some more examples which
are actually written here,

00:02:34.149 --> 00:02:36.160
so they'll find their way into
your notes.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.541
So, for example,
if you have a joint project

00:02:38.541 --> 00:02:41.089
that you're working on,
perhaps it's a homework

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:43.445
assignment,
or perhaps it's a video project

00:02:43.445 --> 00:02:45.758
like these guys,
that can turn into a Prisoners'

00:02:45.758 --> 00:02:46.979
Dilemma.
Why?

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:52.740
Because each individual might
have an incentive to shirk.

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:56.113
Price competition -- two firms
competing with one another in

00:02:56.113 --> 00:02:59.430
prices -- can have a Prisoners'
Dilemma aspect about it.

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.935
Why?
Because no matter how the other

00:03:01.935 --> 00:03:04.571
firm, your competitor,
prices you might have an

00:03:04.571 --> 00:03:08.016
incentive to undercut them.
If both firms behave that way,

00:03:08.016 --> 00:03:11.008
prices will get driven down
towards marginal cost and

00:03:11.008 --> 00:03:13.850
industry profits will suffer.
In the first case,

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:16.629
if everyone shirks you end up
with a bad product.

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:19.356
In the second case,
if both firms undercut each

00:03:19.356 --> 00:03:22.793
other, you end up with low
prices, that's actually good for

00:03:22.793 --> 00:03:26.560
consumers but bad for firms.
Let me mention a third example.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.881
Suppose there's a common
resource out there,

00:03:29.881 --> 00:03:34.129
maybe it's a fish stock or
maybe it's the atmosphere.

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:36.500
There's a Prisoners' Dilemma
aspect to this too.

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.210
You might have an incentive to
over fish.

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:41.558
Why?
Because if the other countries

00:03:41.558 --> 00:03:44.190
with this fish stock--let's say
the fish stock is the

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.430
Atlantic--if the other countries
are going to fish as normal,

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.120
you may as well fish as normal
too.

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.455
And if the other countries
aren't going to cut down on

00:03:53.455 --> 00:03:55.437
their fishing,
then you want to catch the fish

00:03:55.437 --> 00:03:57.301
now,
because there aren't going to

00:03:57.301 --> 00:04:00.487
be any there tomorrow.
Another example of this would

00:04:00.487 --> 00:04:03.229
be global warming and carbon
emissions.

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:06.084
Again, leaving aside the
science, about which I'm sure

00:04:06.084 --> 00:04:08.993
some of you know more than me
here, the issue of carbon

00:04:08.993 --> 00:04:11.039
emissions is a Prisoners'
Dilemma.

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:15.337
Each of us individually has an
incentive to emit carbons as

00:04:15.337 --> 00:04:17.139
usual.
If everyone else is cutting

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:19.424
down I don't have too,
and if everyone else does cut

00:04:19.424 --> 00:04:22.135
down I don't have to,
I end up using hot water and

00:04:22.135 --> 00:04:25.716
driving a big car and so on.
In each of these cases we end

00:04:25.716 --> 00:04:29.230
up with a bad outcome,
so this is socially important.

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:31.978
This is not just some abstract
thing going on in a class in

00:04:31.978 --> 00:04:33.327
Yale.
We need to think about

00:04:33.327 --> 00:04:35.409
solutions to this,
right from the start of the

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:37.629
class, and we already talked
about something.

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:41.989
We pointed out,
that this is not just a failure

00:04:41.989 --> 00:04:45.406
of communication.
Communication per se will not

00:04:45.406 --> 00:04:47.470
get you out of a Prisoners'
Dilemma.

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:50.127
You can talk about it as much
as you like, but as long as

00:04:50.127 --> 00:04:52.926
you're going to go home and
still drive your Hummer and have

00:04:52.926 --> 00:04:55.443
sixteen hot showers a day,
we're still going to have high

00:04:55.443 --> 00:04:57.918
carbon emissions.
You can talk about working hard

00:04:57.918 --> 00:05:01.263
on your joint problem sets,
but as long as you go home and

00:05:01.263 --> 00:05:03.610
you don't work hard,
it doesn't help.

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:05.244
In fact, if the other person is
working hard,

00:05:05.244 --> 00:05:06.990
or is cutting back on their
carbon emissions,

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:10.047
you have every bit more
incentive to not work hard or to

00:05:10.047 --> 00:05:12.160
keep high carbon emissions
yourself.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.188
So we need something more and
the kind of things we can see

00:05:15.188 --> 00:05:17.120
more: we can think about
contracts;

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.510
we can think about treaties
between countries;

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:23.890
we can think about regulation.
All of these things work by

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:27.520
changing the payoffs.
Not just talking about it,

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:31.561
but actually changing the
outcomes actually and changing

00:05:31.561 --> 00:05:34.500
the payoffs, changing the
incentives.

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.651
Another thing we can do,
a very important thing,

00:05:36.651 --> 00:05:39.488
is we can think about changing
the game into a game of repeated

00:05:39.488 --> 00:05:41.639
interaction and seeing how much
that helps,

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:45.230
and we'll come back and revisit
that later in the class.

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:48.094
One last thing we can think of
doing but we have to be a bit

00:05:48.094 --> 00:05:50.182
careful here,
is we can think about changing

00:05:50.182 --> 00:05:53.019
the payoffs by education.
I think of that as the "Maoist"

00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:54.693
strategy.
Lock people up in classrooms

00:05:54.693 --> 00:05:56.600
and tell them they should be
better people.

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:58.876
That may or may not work -- I'm
not optimistic -- but at least

00:05:58.876 --> 00:06:03.170
it's the same idea.
We're changing payoffs.

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:08.709
So that's enough for recap and
I want to move on now.

00:06:08.709 --> 00:06:12.278
And in particular,
we left you hanging at the end

00:06:12.278 --> 00:06:14.613
last time.
We played a game at the very

00:06:14.613 --> 00:06:16.624
end last time,
where each of you chose a

00:06:16.624 --> 00:06:19.718
number -- all of you chose a
number -- and we said the winner

00:06:19.718 --> 00:06:22.760
was going to be the person who
gets closest to two-thirds of

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:25.509
the average in the class.
Now we've figured that out,

00:06:25.509 --> 00:06:27.911
we figured out who the winner
is, and I know that all of you

00:06:27.911 --> 00:06:30.069
have been trying to see if you
won, is that right?

00:06:30.069 --> 00:06:32.170
I'm going to leave you in
suspense.

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:33.480
I am going to tell you today
who won.

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:35.963
We did figure it out,
and we'll get there,

00:06:35.963 --> 00:06:38.750
but I want to do a little bit
of work first.

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:40.000
So we're just going to leave it
in suspense.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:46.868
That'll stop you walking out
early if you want to win the

00:06:46.868 --> 00:06:49.295
prize.
So there's going to be lots of

00:06:49.295 --> 00:06:51.560
times in this class when we get
to play games,

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:54.126
we get to have classroom
discussions and so on,

00:06:54.126 --> 00:06:57.418
but there's going to be some
times when we have to slow down

00:06:57.418 --> 00:07:00.139
and do some work,
and the next twenty minutes are

00:07:00.139 --> 00:07:04.003
going to be that.
So with apologies for being a

00:07:04.003 --> 00:07:09.420
bit more boring for twenty
minutes, let's do something

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:14.234
we'll call formal stuff.
In particular,

00:07:14.234 --> 00:07:21.424
I want to develop and make sure
we all understand,

00:07:21.424 --> 00:07:27.000
what are the ingredients of a
game?

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.139
So in particular,
we need to figure out what

00:07:29.139 --> 00:07:31.079
formally makes something into a
game.

00:07:31.079 --> 00:07:34.819
The formal parts of a game are
this.

00:07:34.819 --> 00:07:40.394
We need players -- and while
we're here let's develop some

00:07:40.394 --> 00:07:43.609
notation.
So the standard notation for

00:07:43.609 --> 00:07:48.269
players, I'm going to use things
like little i and little j.

00:07:48.269 --> 00:07:51.453
So in that numbers game,
the game when all of you wrote

00:07:51.453 --> 00:07:54.636
down a number and handed it in
at the end of last time,

00:07:54.636 --> 00:07:56.960
the players were who?
The players were you.

00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:01.033
You'all were the players.
Useful text and expression

00:08:01.033 --> 00:08:08.526
meaning you plural.
In the numbers game,

00:08:08.526 --> 00:08:20.047
you'all, were the players.
Second ingredient of the game

00:08:20.047 --> 00:08:23.170
are strategies.
(There's a good clue here.

00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:31.711
If I'm writing you should be
writing.) Notation:

00:08:31.711 --> 00:08:40.617
so I'm going to use little
"s_i" to be a

00:08:40.617 --> 00:08:49.996
particular strategy of Player i.
So an example in that game

00:08:49.996 --> 00:08:54.360
might have been choosing the
number 13.

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:58.628
Everyone understand that?
Now I need to distinguish this

00:08:58.628 --> 00:09:01.870
from the set of possible
strategies of Player I,

00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:05.870
so I'm going to use capital
"S_i" to be what?

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:21.210
To be the set of alternatives.
The set of possible strategies

00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:25.996
of Player i.
So in that game we played at

00:09:25.996 --> 00:09:28.081
the end last time,
what were the set of

00:09:28.081 --> 00:09:33.173
strategies?
They were the sets 1,2,

00:09:33.173 --> 00:09:39.309
3, all the way up to 100.
When distinguishing a

00:09:39.309 --> 00:09:42.700
particular strategy from the set
of possible strategies.

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:45.417
While we're here,
our third notation for

00:09:45.417 --> 00:09:49.250
strategy, I'm going to use
little "s" without an "i,"

00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:59.331
(no subscripts):
little "s" without an "i," to

00:09:59.331 --> 00:10:07.620
mean a particular play of the
game.

00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:10.698
So what do I mean by that?
All of you, at the end last

00:10:10.698 --> 00:10:15.139
time, wrote down this number and
handed them in so we had one

00:10:15.139 --> 00:10:19.580
number, one strategy choice for
each person in the class.

00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:23.066
So here they are,
here's my collected in,

00:10:23.066 --> 00:10:26.378
sort of strategy choices.
Here's the bundle of bits of

00:10:26.378 --> 00:10:29.488
paper you handed in last time.
This is a particular play of

00:10:29.488 --> 00:10:32.318
the game.
I've got each person's name and

00:10:32.318 --> 00:10:36.042
I've got a number from each
person: a strategy from each

00:10:36.042 --> 00:10:37.890
person.
We actually have it on a

00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:40.328
spreadsheet as well:
so here it is written out on a

00:10:40.328 --> 00:10:42.929
spreadsheet.
Each of your names is on this

00:10:42.929 --> 00:10:45.379
spreadsheet and the number you
chose.

00:10:45.379 --> 00:10:48.075
So that's a particular play of
the game and that has a

00:10:48.075 --> 00:10:53.297
different name.
We sometimes call this "a

00:10:53.297 --> 00:10:57.585
strategy profile."
So in the textbook,

00:10:57.585 --> 00:11:00.719
you'll sometimes see the term a
strategy profile or a strategy

00:11:00.719 --> 00:11:03.059
vector, or a strategy list.
It doesn't really matter.

00:11:03.059 --> 00:11:07.211
What it's saying is one
strategy for each player in the

00:11:07.211 --> 00:11:11.943
game.
So in the numbers game this is

00:11:11.943 --> 00:11:20.470
the spreadsheet -- or an example
of this is the spreadsheet.

00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:26.127
(I need to make it so you can
still see that,

00:11:26.127 --> 00:11:31.399
so I'm going to pull down these
boards.

00:11:31.399 --> 00:11:37.722
And let me clean something.) So
you might think we're done

00:11:37.722 --> 00:11:40.710
right?
We've got players.

00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:43.035
We've got the choices they
could make: that's their

00:11:43.035 --> 00:11:45.319
strategy sets.
We've got those individual

00:11:45.319 --> 00:11:47.468
strategies.
And we've got the choices they

00:11:47.468 --> 00:11:49.769
actually did make:
that's the strategy profile.

00:11:49.769 --> 00:11:51.421
Seems like we've got everything
you could possibly want to

00:11:51.421 --> 00:11:54.610
describe in a game.
What are we missing here?

00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:56.830
Shout it out.
"Payoffs."

00:11:56.830 --> 00:12:02.451
We're missing payoffs.
So, to complete the game,

00:12:02.451 --> 00:12:07.224
we need payoffs.
Again, I need notation for

00:12:07.224 --> 00:12:09.347
payoffs.
So in this course,

00:12:09.347 --> 00:12:14.059
I'll try and use "U" for utile,
to be Player i's payoff.

00:12:14.059 --> 00:12:18.644
So "U_i" will depend
on Player 1's choice …

00:12:18.644 --> 00:12:22.063
all the way to Player i's own
choice …

00:12:22.063 --> 00:12:25.250
all the way up to Player N's
choices.

00:12:25.250 --> 00:12:28.560
So Player i's payoff
"U_i," depends on all

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:31.027
the choices in the class,
in this case,

00:12:31.027 --> 00:12:35.421
including her own choice.
Of course, a shorter way of

00:12:35.421 --> 00:12:40.165
writing that would be
"U_i(s)," it depends

00:12:40.165 --> 00:12:44.323
on the profile.
So in the numbers game what is

00:12:44.323 --> 00:12:46.559
this?
In the numbers game

00:12:46.559 --> 00:12:50.039
"U_i(s)" can be two
things.

00:12:50.039 --> 00:12:56.815
It can be 5 dollars minus your
error in pennies,

00:12:56.815 --> 00:12:59.842
if you won.
I guess it could be something

00:12:59.842 --> 00:13:01.671
if there was a tie,
I won't bother writing that

00:13:01.671 --> 00:13:07.529
now.
And it's going to be 0

00:13:07.529 --> 00:13:13.056
otherwise.
So we've now got all of the

00:13:13.056 --> 00:13:17.515
ingredients of the game:
players, strategies,

00:13:17.515 --> 00:13:20.598
payoffs.
Now we're going to make an

00:13:20.598 --> 00:13:24.460
assumption today and for the
next ten weeks or so;

00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:29.670
so for almost all the class.
We're going to assume that

00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:33.966
these are known.
We're going to assume that

00:13:33.966 --> 00:13:38.153
everybody knows the possible
strategies everyone else could

00:13:38.153 --> 00:13:41.980
choose and everyone knows
everyone else's payoffs.

00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:44.328
Now that's not a very realistic
assumption and we are going to

00:13:44.328 --> 00:13:46.330
come back and challenge it at
the end of semester,

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:49.725
but this will be complicated
enough to give us a lot of

00:13:49.725 --> 00:13:54.784
material in the next ten weeks.
I need one more piece of

00:13:54.784 --> 00:14:01.500
notation and then we can get
back to having some fun.

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:06.018
So one more piece of notation,
I'm going to write

00:14:06.018 --> 00:14:11.059
"s_-i" to mean what?
It's going to mean a strategy

00:14:11.059 --> 00:14:13.860
choice for everybody except
person "i."

00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:16.830
It's going to be useful to have
that notation around.

00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:30.049
So this is a choice for all
except person "i" or Player i.

00:14:30.049 --> 00:14:32.841
So, in particular,
if you're person 1 and then

00:14:32.841 --> 00:14:35.323
"s_-i" would be
"s_2,

00:14:35.323 --> 00:14:37.433
s_3,
s_4" up to

00:14:37.433 --> 00:14:41.280
"s_n" but it wouldn't
include "s_1."

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:45.235
It's useful why?
Because sometimes it's useful

00:14:45.235 --> 00:14:50.445
to think about the payoffs,
as coming from "i's" own choice

00:14:50.445 --> 00:14:55.355
and everyone else's choices.
It's just a useful way of

00:14:55.355 --> 00:14:59.295
thinking about things.
Now this is when I want to stop

00:14:59.295 --> 00:15:02.498
for a second and I know that
some of you, from past

00:15:02.498 --> 00:15:05.059
experience, are somewhat math
phobic.

00:15:05.059 --> 00:15:08.205
You do not have to wave your
hands in the air if you're math

00:15:08.205 --> 00:15:11.403
phobic, but since some of you
are, let me just get you all to

00:15:11.403 --> 00:15:14.204
take a deep breath.
This goes for people who are

00:15:14.204 --> 00:15:18.090
math phobic at home too.
So everyone's in a slight panic

00:15:18.090 --> 00:15:19.419
now.
You came here today.

00:15:19.419 --> 00:15:20.730
You thought everything was
going to fine.

00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:22.650
And now I'm putting math on the
board.

00:15:22.650 --> 00:15:24.799
Take a deep breath.
It's not that hard,

00:15:24.799 --> 00:15:27.856
and in particular,
notice that all I'm doing here

00:15:27.856 --> 00:15:30.976
is writing down notation.
There's actually no math going

00:15:30.976 --> 00:15:33.610
on here at all.
I'm just developing notation.

00:15:33.610 --> 00:15:36.374
I don't want anybody to quit
this class because they're

00:15:36.374 --> 00:15:38.320
worried about math or math
notation.

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:40.594
So if you are in that category
of somebody who might quit it

00:15:40.594 --> 00:15:41.982
because of that,
come and talk to me,

00:15:41.982 --> 00:15:45.380
come and talk to the TAs.
We will get you through it.

00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:48.012
It's fine to be math phobic.
I'm phobic of all sorts of

00:15:48.012 --> 00:15:49.622
things.
Not necessarily math,

00:15:49.622 --> 00:15:51.858
but all sorts of things.
So a serious thing,

00:15:51.858 --> 00:15:54.709
a lot of people get put off by
notation, it looks scarier than

00:15:54.709 --> 00:15:58.107
it is,
there's nothing going on here

00:15:58.107 --> 00:16:01.700
except for notation at this
point.

00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:07.149
So let's have an example to
help us fix some ideas.

00:16:07.149 --> 00:16:14.299
(And again, I'll have to clean
the board, so give me a second.)

00:16:14.299 --> 00:16:21.103
I think an example might help
those people who are disturbed

00:16:21.103 --> 00:16:27.381
by the notation.
So here's a game which we're

00:16:27.381 --> 00:16:34.316
going to discuss briefly.
It involves two players and

00:16:34.316 --> 00:16:41.769
we'll call the Players I and II
and Player I has two choices,

00:16:41.769 --> 00:16:47.826
top and bottom,
and Player II has three choices

00:16:47.826 --> 00:16:51.250
left, center,
and right.

00:16:51.250 --> 00:16:53.389
It's just a very simple
abstract example for now.

00:16:53.389 --> 00:16:55.039
And let's suppose the payoffs
are like this.

00:16:55.039 --> 00:16:56.620
They're not particularly
interesting.

00:16:56.620 --> 00:17:01.639
We're just going to do it for
the purpose of illustration.

00:17:01.639 --> 00:17:08.283
So here are the payoffs:
(5, -1), (11,3),

00:17:08.283 --> 00:17:13.099
(0,0), (6,4),
(0,2), (2,0).

00:17:13.099 --> 00:17:17.869
Let's just map the notation we
just developed into this game.

00:17:17.869 --> 00:17:21.180
So first of all,
who are the players here?

00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:24.213
Well there's no secret there,
the players are -- let's just

00:17:24.213 --> 00:17:29.123
write it down why don't we.
The players here in this game

00:17:29.123 --> 00:17:36.750
are Player I and Player II.
What about the strategy sets or

00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:43.448
the strategy alternatives?
So here Player I's strategy

00:17:43.448 --> 00:17:50.233
set, she has two choices top or
bottom, represented by the rows,

00:17:50.233 --> 00:17:56.049
which are hopefully the top row
and the bottom row.

00:17:56.049 --> 00:18:00.122
Player II has three choices,
this game is not symmetric,

00:18:00.122 --> 00:18:04.269
so they have different number
of choices, that's fine.

00:18:04.269 --> 00:18:07.736
Player II has three choices
left, center,

00:18:07.736 --> 00:18:11.376
and right, represented by the
left, center,

00:18:11.376 --> 00:18:15.971
and right column in the matrix.
Just to point out in passing,

00:18:15.971 --> 00:18:19.039
up to now, we've been looking
mostly at symmetric games.

00:18:19.039 --> 00:18:21.114
Notice this game is not
symmetric in the payoffs or in

00:18:21.114 --> 00:18:23.390
the strategies.
There's no particular reason

00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:26.953
why games have to be symmetric.
Payoffs: again,

00:18:26.953 --> 00:18:32.930
this is not rocket science,
but let's do it anyway.

00:18:32.930 --> 00:18:36.986
So just an example of payoffs.
So Player I's payoff,

00:18:36.986 --> 00:18:41.275
if she chooses top and Player
II chooses center,

00:18:41.275 --> 00:18:46.660
we read by looking at the top
row and the center column,

00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:51.720
and Player I's payoff is the
first of these payoffs,

00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:54.569
so it's 11.
Player II's payoff,

00:18:54.569 --> 00:18:57.770
from the same choices,
top for Player I,

00:18:57.770 --> 00:19:01.398
center for Player II,
again we go along the top row

00:19:01.398 --> 00:19:04.372
and the center column,
but this time we choose Player

00:19:04.372 --> 00:19:10.253
II's payoff,
which is the second payoff,

00:19:10.253 --> 00:19:14.256
so it's 3.
So again, I'm hoping this is

00:19:14.256 --> 00:19:17.259
calming down the math phobics in
the room.

00:19:17.259 --> 00:19:18.789
Now how do we think this game
is going to be played?

00:19:18.789 --> 00:19:20.680
It's not a particularly
interesting game,

00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:22.996
but while we're here,
why don't we just discuss it

00:19:22.996 --> 00:19:25.694
for a second.
If our mike guys get a little

00:19:25.694 --> 00:19:28.882
bit ready here.
So how do we think this game

00:19:28.882 --> 00:19:32.742
should be played?
Well let's ask somebody at

00:19:32.742 --> 00:19:36.807
random perhaps.
Ale, do you want to ask this

00:19:36.807 --> 00:19:41.972
guy in the blue shirt here,
does Player I have a dominated

00:19:41.972 --> 00:19:43.910
strategy?
Student: No,

00:19:43.910 --> 00:19:45.880
Player I doesn't have a
dominated strategy.

00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:48.476
For instance,
if Player II picks left then

00:19:48.476 --> 00:19:52.276
Player I wants to pick bottom,
but if Player II picks center,

00:19:52.276 --> 00:19:54.830
Player I wants to pick center.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:55.540
Good.
Excellent.

00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:56.580
Very good.
I should have had you stand up.

00:19:56.580 --> 00:19:57.380
I forgot that.
Never mind.

00:19:57.380 --> 00:19:59.890
But that was very clear,
thank you.

00:19:59.890 --> 00:20:01.370
Was that loud enough so people
could hear it?

00:20:01.370 --> 00:20:03.812
Did people hear that?
People in the back,

00:20:03.812 --> 00:20:05.786
did you hear it?
So even that wasn't loud enough

00:20:05.786 --> 00:20:08.339
okay, so we we really need to
get people--That was very clear,

00:20:08.339 --> 00:20:10.208
very nice, but we need people
to stand up and shout,

00:20:10.208 --> 00:20:11.710
or these people at the back
can't hear.

00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:14.170
So your name is?
Student: Patrick.

00:20:14.170 --> 00:20:16.778
Professor Ben Polak:
What Patrick said was:

00:20:16.778 --> 00:20:19.440
no, Player I does not have a
dominated strategy.

00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:22.304
Top is better than bottom
against left -- sorry,

00:20:22.304 --> 00:20:25.779
bottom is better than top
against left because 6 is bigger

00:20:25.779 --> 00:20:28.039
than 5,
but top is better than bottom

00:20:28.039 --> 00:20:30.450
against center because 11 is
bigger than 0.

00:20:30.450 --> 00:20:34.179
Everyone see that?
So it's not the case that top

00:20:34.179 --> 00:20:38.239
always beats--it's not the case
that top always does better than

00:20:38.239 --> 00:20:41.720
bottom, or that bottom always
does better than top.

00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:45.299
What about, raise hands this
time, what about Player II?

00:20:45.299 --> 00:20:50.410
Does Player II have a dominated
strategy?

00:20:50.410 --> 00:20:56.329
Everyone's keeping their hands
firmly down so as not to get

00:20:56.329 --> 00:20:58.987
spotted here.
Ale, can we try this guy in

00:20:58.987 --> 00:21:01.351
white?
Do you want to stand up and

00:21:01.351 --> 00:21:05.569
wait until Ale gets there,
and really yell it out now.

00:21:05.569 --> 00:21:09.156
Student: I believe right
is a dominated strategy because

00:21:09.156 --> 00:21:12.697
if Player I chooses top,
then Player II will choose

00:21:12.697 --> 00:21:15.910
center, and if-- I'm getting
confused now,

00:21:15.910 --> 00:21:20.498
it looks better on my paper.
But yeah, right is never the

00:21:20.498 --> 00:21:22.268
best choice.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:21:22.268 --> 00:21:23.778
Okay, good.
Let's be a little bit careful

00:21:23.778 --> 00:21:25.540
here.
So your name is?

00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:27.515
Student: Thomas.
Professor Ben Polak: So

00:21:27.515 --> 00:21:30.215
Thomas said something which was
true, but it doesn't quite match

00:21:30.215 --> 00:21:32.230
with the definition of a
dominated strategy.

00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:36.925
What Thomas said was,
right is never a best choice,

00:21:36.925 --> 00:21:39.801
that's true.
But to be a dominated strategy

00:21:39.801 --> 00:21:43.372
we need something else.
We need that there's another

00:21:43.372 --> 00:21:47.269
strategy of Player II that
always does better.

00:21:47.269 --> 00:21:49.218
That turns out also to be true
in this case,

00:21:49.218 --> 00:21:53.367
but let's just see.
So in this particular game,

00:21:53.367 --> 00:21:57.750
I claim that center dominates
right.

00:21:57.750 --> 00:22:01.194
So let's just see that.
If Player I chose top,

00:22:01.194 --> 00:22:04.525
center yields 3,
right yields 0:

00:22:04.525 --> 00:22:09.356
3 is bigger than 0.
And if Player I chooses bottom,

00:22:09.356 --> 00:22:12.221
then center yields 2,
right yields 0:

00:22:12.221 --> 00:22:16.066
2 is bigger than 0 again.
So in this game,

00:22:16.066 --> 00:22:19.400
center strictly dominates
right.

00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:22.314
What you said was true,
but I wanted something

00:22:22.314 --> 00:22:24.710
specifically about domination
here.

00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:30.956
So what we know here,
we know that Player II should

00:22:30.956 --> 00:22:33.881
not choose right.
Now, in fact,

00:22:33.881 --> 00:22:36.384
that's as far as we can get
with dominance arguments in this

00:22:36.384 --> 00:22:37.785
particular game,
but nevertheless,

00:22:37.785 --> 00:22:39.440
let's just stick with it a
second.

00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:43.807
I gave you the definition of
strict dominance last time and

00:22:43.807 --> 00:22:47.297
it's also in the handout.
By the way, the handout on the

00:22:47.297 --> 00:22:49.333
web.
But let me write that

00:22:49.333 --> 00:22:53.004
definition again,
using or making use of the

00:22:53.004 --> 00:23:00.649
notation from the class.
So definition so:

00:23:00.649 --> 00:23:15.411
Player i's strategy
"s'_i" is strictly

00:23:15.411 --> 00:23:31.430
dominated by Player i's strategy
"s_i,

00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:36.233
" and now we can use our
notation, if "U_I"

00:23:36.233 --> 00:23:40.649
from choosing "s_i,"
when other people choose

00:23:40.649 --> 00:23:43.515
"s_-i," is strictly
bigger than

00:23:43.515 --> 00:23:47.313
U_I(s'_i)
when other people choose

00:23:47.313 --> 00:23:52.117
"s_-i,"
and the key part of the

00:23:52.117 --> 00:23:57.869
definition is,
for all "s_-i."

00:23:57.869 --> 00:24:00.531
So to say it in words,
Player i's strategy

00:24:00.531 --> 00:24:03.971
"s'_i" is strictly
dominated by her strategy

00:24:03.971 --> 00:24:07.312
"s_i,"
if "s_i" always does

00:24:07.312 --> 00:24:11.602
strictly better -- always yields
a higher payoff for Player i --

00:24:11.602 --> 00:24:14.190
no matter what the other people
do.

00:24:14.190 --> 00:24:17.600
So this is the same definition
we saw last time,

00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:21.446
just being a little bit more
nerdy and putting in some

00:24:21.446 --> 00:24:23.832
notation.
People panicking about that,

00:24:23.832 --> 00:24:26.099
people look like deer in the
headlamps yet?

00:24:26.099 --> 00:24:31.779
No, you look all right:
all rightish.

00:24:31.779 --> 00:24:35.980
Let's have a look at another
example.

00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:42.953
People okay, I can move this?
All right, so it's a slightly

00:24:42.953 --> 00:24:46.519
more exciting example now.
So imagine the following

00:24:46.519 --> 00:24:50.650
example, an invader is thinking
about invading a country,

00:24:50.650 --> 00:24:55.128
and there are two ways -- there
are two passes if you like --

00:24:55.128 --> 00:24:57.890
through which he can lead his
army.

00:24:57.890 --> 00:25:01.861
You are the defender of this
country and you have to decide

00:25:01.861 --> 00:25:05.558
which of these passes or which
of these routes into the

00:25:05.558 --> 00:25:07.948
country,
you're going to choose to

00:25:07.948 --> 00:25:09.840
defend.
And the catch is,

00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:13.519
you can only defend one of
these two routes.

00:25:13.519 --> 00:25:15.705
If you want a real world
example of this,

00:25:15.705 --> 00:25:18.820
think about the third Century
B.C., someone can correct me

00:25:18.820 --> 00:25:20.977
afterwards.
I think it's the third Century

00:25:20.977 --> 00:25:23.142
B.C.
when Hannibal is thinking of

00:25:23.142 --> 00:25:25.651
crossing the Alps.
Not Hannibal Lecter:

00:25:25.651 --> 00:25:28.510
Hannibal the general in the
third Century B.C..

00:25:28.510 --> 00:25:32.292
The one with the elephants.
Okay, so the key here is going

00:25:32.292 --> 00:25:37.374
to be that there are two passes.
One of these passes is a hard

00:25:37.374 --> 00:25:39.039
pass.
It goes over the Alps.

00:25:39.039 --> 00:25:41.130
And the other one is an easy
pass.

00:25:41.130 --> 00:25:46.569
It goes along the coast.
If the invader chooses the hard

00:25:46.569 --> 00:25:51.794
pass he will lose one battalion
of his army simply in getting

00:25:51.794 --> 00:25:55.827
over the mountains,
simply in going through the

00:25:55.827 --> 00:25:58.192
hard pass.
If he meets your army,

00:25:58.192 --> 00:26:02.086
whichever pass he chooses,
if he meets your army defending

00:26:02.086 --> 00:26:05.160
a pass, then he'll lose another
battalion.

00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:07.028
I haven't given you--I've given
you roughly the choices,

00:26:07.028 --> 00:26:09.066
the choice they're going to be
for the attacker which pass to

00:26:09.066 --> 00:26:11.285
choose,
and for the defender which pass

00:26:11.285 --> 00:26:13.818
to defend.
But let's put down some payoffs

00:26:13.818 --> 00:26:16.000
so we can start talking about
this.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:20.120
So in this game,
the payoffs for this game are

00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:25.089
going to be as follows.
It's a simple two by two game.

00:26:25.089 --> 00:26:29.219
This is going to be the
attacker, this is Hannibal,

00:26:29.219 --> 00:26:32.440
and this is going to be the
defender,

00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:34.545
(and I've forgotten which
general was defending and

00:26:34.545 --> 00:26:36.019
someone's about to tell me
that).

00:26:36.019 --> 00:26:38.906
And there are two passes you
could defend:

00:26:38.906 --> 00:26:43.054
the easy pass or the hard pass.
And there's two you could use

00:26:43.054 --> 00:26:45.130
to attack through,
easy or hard.

00:26:45.130 --> 00:26:48.728
(Again, easy pass here just
means no mountains,

00:26:48.728 --> 00:26:52.639
we're not talking about
something on the New Jersey

00:26:52.639 --> 00:26:56.549
Turnpike.) So the payoffs here
are as follows,

00:26:56.549 --> 00:27:01.039
and I'll explain them in a
second.

00:27:01.039 --> 00:27:03.228
So his payoff,
the attacker's payoff,

00:27:03.228 --> 00:27:07.119
is how many battalions does he
get to bring into your country?

00:27:07.119 --> 00:27:10.803
He only has two to start with
and for you, it's how many

00:27:10.803 --> 00:27:15.173
battalions of his get destroyed?
So just to give an example,

00:27:15.173 --> 00:27:19.439
if he goes through the hard
pass and you defend the hard

00:27:19.439 --> 00:27:21.051
pass,
he loses one of those

00:27:21.051 --> 00:27:23.506
battalions going over the
mountains and the other one

00:27:23.506 --> 00:27:26.478
because he meets you.
So he has none left and you've

00:27:26.478 --> 00:27:29.992
managed to destroy two of them.
Conversely, if he goes on the

00:27:29.992 --> 00:27:33.044
hard pass and you defend the
easy pass, he's going to lose

00:27:33.044 --> 00:27:36.070
one of those battalions.
He'll have one left.

00:27:36.070 --> 00:27:39.281
He lost it in the mountains.
But that's the only one he's

00:27:39.281 --> 00:27:42.440
going to lose because you were
defending the wrong pass.

00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:46.160
Everyone understand the payoffs
of this game?

00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:49.339
So now imagine yourself as a
Roman general.

00:27:49.339 --> 00:27:50.802
This is going to be a little
bit of a stretch for

00:27:50.802 --> 00:27:52.599
imagination, but imagination
yourself as a Roman general,

00:27:52.599 --> 00:27:54.890
and let's figure out what
you're going to do.

00:27:54.890 --> 00:27:58.710
You're the defender.
What are you going to do?

00:27:58.710 --> 00:28:03.361
So let's have a show of hands.
How many of you think you

00:28:03.361 --> 00:28:06.974
should defend the easy pass?
Raise your hands,

00:28:06.974 --> 00:28:08.520
let's raise your hands so Jude
can see them.

00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:10.234
Keep them up.
Wave them in the air with a bit

00:28:10.234 --> 00:28:12.309
of motion.
Wave them in the air.

00:28:12.309 --> 00:28:14.802
We should get you flags okay,
because these are the Romans

00:28:14.802 --> 00:28:17.856
defending the easy pass.
And how many of you think

00:28:17.856 --> 00:28:20.769
you're going to defend the hard
pass?

00:28:20.769 --> 00:28:23.807
We have a huge number of people
who don't want to be Roman

00:28:23.807 --> 00:28:25.469
generals here.
Let's try it again,

00:28:25.469 --> 00:28:26.450
no abstentions,
right?

00:28:26.450 --> 00:28:28.859
I'm not going to penalize you
for giving the wrong answer.

00:28:28.859 --> 00:28:30.900
So how many of you think you're
going to defend the easy pass?

00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:34.973
Raise your hands again.
And how many think you're going

00:28:34.973 --> 00:28:38.843
to defend the hard pass?
So we have a majority choosing

00:28:38.843 --> 00:28:41.530
easy pass -- had a large
majority.

00:28:41.530 --> 00:28:45.876
So what's going on here?
Is it the case that defending

00:28:45.876 --> 00:28:51.260
the easy pass dominates
defending the hard pass?

00:28:51.260 --> 00:28:53.039
Is that the case?
Is it the case that defending

00:28:53.039 --> 00:28:55.100
the easy pass dominates
defending the hard pass?

00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:57.200
You can shout out.
No, it's not.

00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:01.752
In fact, we could check that if
the attacker attacks through the

00:29:01.752 --> 00:29:05.771
easy pass, not surprisingly,
you do better if you defend the

00:29:05.771 --> 00:29:08.279
easy pass than the hard pass:
1 versus 0.

00:29:08.279 --> 00:29:11.549
But if the attacker was to
attack through the hard pass,

00:29:11.549 --> 00:29:14.758
again not surprisingly,
you do better if you defend the

00:29:14.758 --> 00:29:19.028
hard pass than the easy pass.
So that's not an unintuitive

00:29:19.028 --> 00:29:21.330
finding.
It isn't the case that

00:29:21.330 --> 00:29:24.240
defending easy dominates
defending hard.

00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:26.420
You just want to match with the
attacker.

00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:29.400
Nevertheless,
almost all of you chose easy.

00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:30.965
What's going on?
Can someone tell me what's

00:29:30.965 --> 00:29:32.494
going on?
Let's get the mikes going a

00:29:32.494 --> 00:29:34.382
second.
So can we catch the guy with

00:29:34.382 --> 00:29:36.720
the--can we catch this guy with
the beard?

00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:38.829
Just wait for the mike to get
there.

00:29:38.829 --> 00:29:42.990
If you could stand up:
stand up and shout.

00:29:42.990 --> 00:29:44.982
There you go.
Student: Because you

00:29:44.982 --> 00:29:49.187
want to minimize the amount of
enemy soldiers that reach Rome

00:29:49.187 --> 00:29:52.379
or whatever location it is.
Professor Ben Polak: You

00:29:52.379 --> 00:29:54.312
want to minimize the number of
soldiers that reach Rome,

00:29:54.312 --> 00:29:55.502
that's true.
On the other hand,

00:29:55.502 --> 00:29:57.565
we've just argued that you
don't have a dominant strategy

00:29:57.565 --> 00:29:59.429
here;
it's not the case that easy

00:29:59.429 --> 00:30:01.319
dominates hard.
What else could be going on?

00:30:01.319 --> 00:30:03.418
While we've got you up,
why don't we get the other guy

00:30:03.418 --> 00:30:05.160
who's got his hand up there in
the middle.

00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:06.940
Again, stand up and shout in
that mike.

00:30:06.940 --> 00:30:08.160
Point your face towards the
mike.

00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:11.772
Good.
Student: It seems as

00:30:11.772 --> 00:30:16.309
though while you don't have a
dominating strategy,

00:30:16.309 --> 00:30:20.210
it seems like Hannibal is
better off attacking through--It

00:30:20.210 --> 00:30:23.700
seems like he would attack
through the easy pass.

00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:25.080
Professor Ben Polak:
Good, why does it seem like

00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:25.662
that?
That's right,

00:30:25.662 --> 00:30:27.733
we're on the right lines now.
Why does it seem like he's

00:30:27.733 --> 00:30:29.450
going to attack through the easy
pass?

00:30:29.450 --> 00:30:32.461
Student: Well if you're
not defending the easy pass,

00:30:32.461 --> 00:30:35.889
he doesn't lose anyone,
and if he attacks through the

00:30:35.889 --> 00:30:39.779
hard pass he's going to lose at
least one battalion.

00:30:39.779 --> 00:30:42.133
Professor Ben Polak: So
let's look at it from--Let's do

00:30:42.133 --> 00:30:44.255
the exercise--Let's do the
second lesson I emphasized at

00:30:44.255 --> 00:30:46.241
the beginning.
Let's put ourselves in

00:30:46.241 --> 00:30:48.706
Hannibal's shoes,
they're probably boots or

00:30:48.706 --> 00:30:50.312
something.
Whatever you do when you're

00:30:50.312 --> 00:30:51.529
riding an elephant,
whatever you wear.

00:30:51.529 --> 00:30:54.451
Let's put ourselves in
Hannibal's shoes and try and

00:30:54.451 --> 00:30:57.140
figure out what Hannibal's going
to do here.

00:30:57.140 --> 00:31:01.478
So it could be--From Hannibal's
point of view he doesn't know

00:31:01.478 --> 00:31:05.672
which pass you're going to
defend, but let's have a look at

00:31:05.672 --> 00:31:09.143
his payoffs.
If you were to defend the easy

00:31:09.143 --> 00:31:13.770
pass and he goes through the
easy pass, he will get into your

00:31:13.770 --> 00:31:18.551
country with one battalion and
that's the same as he would have

00:31:18.551 --> 00:31:21.789
got if he went through the hard
pass.

00:31:21.789 --> 00:31:25.107
So if you defend the easy pass,
from his point of view,

00:31:25.107 --> 00:31:28.671
it doesn't matter whether he
chooses the easy pass and gets

00:31:28.671 --> 00:31:32.670
one in there or the hard pass,
he gets one in there.

00:31:32.670 --> 00:31:36.432
But if you were to defend the
hard pass, if you were to defend

00:31:36.432 --> 00:31:39.382
the mountains,
then if he chooses the easy

00:31:39.382 --> 00:31:44.180
pass, he gets both battalions in
and if he chooses the hard pass,

00:31:44.180 --> 00:31:49.029
he gets no battalions in.
So in this case, easy is better.

00:31:49.029 --> 00:31:50.279
We have to be a little bit
careful.

00:31:50.279 --> 00:31:55.366
It's not the case that for
Hannibal, choosing the easy pass

00:31:55.366 --> 00:31:59.301
to attack through,
strictly dominates choosing the

00:31:59.301 --> 00:32:03.382
hard pass, but it is the case
that there's a weak notion of

00:32:03.382 --> 00:32:06.955
domination here.
It is the case -- to introduce

00:32:06.955 --> 00:32:11.054
some jargon -- it is the case
that the easy pass for the

00:32:11.054 --> 00:32:15.599
attacker, weakly dominates the
hard pass for the attacker.

00:32:15.599 --> 00:32:17.099
What do I mean by weakly
dominate?

00:32:17.099 --> 00:32:21.877
It means by choosing the easy
pass, he does at least as well,

00:32:21.877 --> 00:32:25.939
and sometimes better,
than he would have done had he

00:32:25.939 --> 00:32:29.738
chosen the hard pass.
So here we have a second

00:32:29.738 --> 00:32:34.486
definition, a new definition for
today, and again we can use our

00:32:34.486 --> 00:32:38.807
jargon.
Definition- Player i's

00:32:38.807 --> 00:32:48.697
strategy, "s'_i" is
weakly dominated by her strategy

00:32:48.697 --> 00:32:58.263
"s_i" if--now we're
going to take advantage of our

00:32:58.263 --> 00:33:07.829
notation--if Player i's payoff
from choosing "s_i"

00:33:07.829 --> 00:33:17.720
against "s_-i" is
always as big as or equal,

00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:22.328
to her payoff from choosing
"s'_i" against

00:33:22.328 --> 00:33:27.660
"s_-i" and this has to
be true for all things that

00:33:27.660 --> 00:33:31.328
anyone else could do.
And in addition,

00:33:31.328 --> 00:33:36.080
Player i's payoff from choosing
"s_i" against

00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:40.921
"s_-i" is strictly
better than her payoff from

00:33:40.921 --> 00:33:45.849
choosing "s'_i"
against "s_-i,"

00:33:45.849 --> 00:33:50.529
for at least one thing that
everyone else could do.

00:33:50.529 --> 00:33:54.335
Just check, that exactly
corresponds to the easy and hard

00:33:54.335 --> 00:33:57.332
thing we just had before.
I'll say it again,

00:33:57.332 --> 00:34:00.237
Player i's strategy
"s'_i" is weakly

00:34:00.237 --> 00:34:03.724
dominated by her strategy
"s_i" if she always

00:34:03.724 --> 00:34:07.145
does at least as well by
choosing "s_i" than

00:34:07.145 --> 00:34:10.826
choosing "s'_i"
regardless of what everyone else

00:34:10.826 --> 00:34:14.543
does,
and sometimes she does strictly

00:34:14.543 --> 00:34:17.158
better.
It seems a pretty powerful

00:34:17.158 --> 00:34:18.993
lesson.
Just as we said you should

00:34:18.993 --> 00:34:21.017
never choose a strictly
dominated strategy,

00:34:21.017 --> 00:34:23.667
you're probably never going to
choose a weakly dominated

00:34:23.667 --> 00:34:28.230
strategy either,
but it's a little more subtle.

00:34:28.230 --> 00:34:29.797
Now that definition,
if you're worried about what

00:34:29.797 --> 00:34:31.659
I've written down here and you
want to see it in words,

00:34:31.659 --> 00:34:35.170
on the handout I've already put
on the web that has the summary

00:34:35.170 --> 00:34:38.561
of the first class,
I included this definition in

00:34:38.561 --> 00:34:41.668
words as well.
So compare the definition of

00:34:41.668 --> 00:34:45.747
words with what's written here
in the nerdy notation on the

00:34:45.747 --> 00:34:47.888
board.
Now since we think that

00:34:47.888 --> 00:34:51.297
Hannibal, the attacker,
is not going to play a weakly

00:34:51.297 --> 00:34:54.605
dominated strategy,
we think Hannibal is not going

00:34:54.605 --> 00:34:58.227
to choose the hard pass.
He's going to attack on the

00:34:58.227 --> 00:35:00.447
easy pass.
And given that,

00:35:00.447 --> 00:35:03.848
what should we defend?
We should defend easy which is

00:35:03.848 --> 00:35:05.893
what most of you chose.
So be honest now:

00:35:05.893 --> 00:35:08.100
was that why most of you chose
easy?

00:35:08.100 --> 00:35:10.619
Yeah, probably was.
We're able to read this.

00:35:10.619 --> 00:35:13.500
So, by putting ourselves in
Hannibal's shoes,

00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:17.363
we could figure out that his
hard attack strategy was weakly

00:35:17.363 --> 00:35:20.199
dominated.
He's going to choose easy,

00:35:20.199 --> 00:35:24.007
so we should defend easy.
Having said that of course,

00:35:24.007 --> 00:35:27.852
Hannibal went through the
mountains which kind of screws

00:35:27.852 --> 00:35:30.300
up the lesson,
but too late now.

00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:38.309
Now then, I promised you we'd
get back to the game from last

00:35:38.309 --> 00:35:40.746
time.
So where have we got to so far

00:35:40.746 --> 00:35:43.692
in this class.
We know from last time that you

00:35:43.692 --> 00:35:47.813
should not choose a dominated
strategy, and we also know we

00:35:47.813 --> 00:35:52.289
probably aren't going to choose
a weakly dominated strategy,

00:35:52.289 --> 00:35:54.608
and we also know that you
should put yourself in other

00:35:54.608 --> 00:35:57.190
people's shoes and figure out
that they're not going to play

00:35:57.190 --> 00:35:59.639
strongly or strictly or weakly
dominated strategies.

00:35:59.639 --> 00:36:02.409
That seems a pretty good way to
predict how other people are

00:36:02.409 --> 00:36:04.661
going to play.
So let's take those ideas and

00:36:04.661 --> 00:36:06.940
go back to the numbers game from
last time.

00:36:06.940 --> 00:36:09.661
Now before I do that,
I don't need the people at home

00:36:09.661 --> 00:36:12.540
to see this, but how many of you
were here last time?

00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:14.329
How many of you were not.
I asked the wrong question.

00:36:14.329 --> 00:36:16.300
How many of you were not here
last time?

00:36:16.300 --> 00:36:18.989
So we handed out again that
game.

00:36:18.989 --> 00:36:21.881
We handed out again the game
with the numbers,

00:36:21.881 --> 00:36:24.836
but just in case,
let me just read out the game

00:36:24.836 --> 00:36:28.269
you played.
This was the game you played.

00:36:28.269 --> 00:36:31.067
"Without showing your neighbor
what you are doing,

00:36:31.067 --> 00:36:34.550
put it in the box below a whole
number between 1 and a 100.

00:36:34.550 --> 00:36:37.661
We will (and in fact have)
calculated the average number

00:36:37.661 --> 00:36:40.659
chosen in the class and the
winner of this game is the

00:36:40.659 --> 00:36:43.714
person who gets closest to
two-thirds times the average

00:36:43.714 --> 00:36:46.425
number.
They will win five dollars

00:36:46.425 --> 00:36:49.010
minus the difference in
pennies."

00:36:49.010 --> 00:36:53.055
So everybody filled that in
last time and I have their

00:36:53.055 --> 00:36:55.976
choices here.
So before we reveal who won,

00:36:55.976 --> 00:36:58.070
let's discuss this a little
bit.

00:36:58.070 --> 00:37:00.954
Let me come down hazardously
off this stage,

00:37:00.954 --> 00:37:04.710
and figure out--Let's get the
mics up a bit for a second,

00:37:04.710 --> 00:37:08.776
we can get some mics ready.
So let me find out from people

00:37:08.776 --> 00:37:11.360
here and see what people did a
second.

00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:16.651
You can be honest here since
I've got everything in front of

00:37:16.651 --> 00:37:20.736
me.
So how many of you chose some

00:37:20.736 --> 00:37:23.620
number like 32,33,
34?

00:37:23.620 --> 00:37:25.844
One hand.
Actually I can tell you,

00:37:25.844 --> 00:37:27.560
nine of you did.
So should I read out the names?

00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:32.176
Should I embarrass people?
We've got Lynette,

00:37:32.176 --> 00:37:34.700
Lukucin, we've Kristin,
Bargeon;

00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:37.622
there's nine of you here.
Let's try it again.How many of

00:37:37.622 --> 00:37:40.190
you chose numbers between 32 and
34?

00:37:40.190 --> 00:37:43.010
Okay, a good number of you.
Now we're seeing some hands up.

00:37:43.010 --> 00:37:46.270
So keep your hands up a second,
those people.

00:37:46.270 --> 00:37:50.417
So let me ask people why?
Can you get your hand into the

00:37:50.417 --> 00:37:51.250
guy?
What's your name?

00:37:51.250 --> 00:37:54.130
If we can get him to stand up.
Stand up a second and shout out

00:37:54.130 --> 00:37:55.780
to the class.
What's your name?

00:37:55.780 --> 00:37:57.796
Student: Chris.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:37:57.796 --> 00:37:59.199
Chris, you're on this list
somewhere.

00:37:59.199 --> 00:38:00.010
Maybe you're not on this list
somewhere.

00:38:00.010 --> 00:38:02.788
Never mind, what did you choose?
Student: I think I chose

00:38:02.788 --> 00:38:03.521
30.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:38:03.521 --> 00:38:06.429
Okay 30, so that's pretty close.
So why did you choose 30?

00:38:06.429 --> 00:38:09.044
Student: Because I
thought everyone was going to be

00:38:09.044 --> 00:38:11.429
around like the 45 range because
66 is two-thirds,

00:38:11.429 --> 00:38:14.195
or right around of 100,
and they were going to go

00:38:14.195 --> 00:38:17.710
two-thirds less than that and I
did one less than that one.

00:38:17.710 --> 00:38:19.880
Professor Ben Polak:
Okay, thank you.

00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:22.630
Let's get one of the others.
There was another one in here.

00:38:22.630 --> 00:38:24.963
Can you just raise your hands
again, the people who were

00:38:24.963 --> 00:38:27.440
around 33,34.
There's somebody in here.

00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:29.910
Can we get you to stand up (and
you're between mikes).

00:38:29.910 --> 00:38:35.820
So that would be--Yep, go ahead.
Shout it out.

00:38:35.820 --> 00:38:37.460
What's your name first of all?
Student: Ryan.

00:38:37.460 --> 00:38:39.072
Professor Ben Polak:
Ryan, I must have you here as

00:38:39.072 --> 00:38:40.740
well, never mind.
What did you choose?

00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:42.200
Student: 33, I think.
Professor Ben Polak: 33.

00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:44.120
Oh you did.
You are Ryan Lowe?

00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:45.891
Student: Yeah.
Professor Ben Polak: You

00:38:45.891 --> 00:38:46.780
are Ryan Lowe,
okay.

00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:49.749
Good, go ahead.
Student: I thought

00:38:49.749 --> 00:38:53.554
similar to Chris actually and I
also thought that if we got

00:38:53.554 --> 00:38:57.227
two-thirds and everyone was
choosing numbers in between 1

00:38:57.227 --> 00:39:00.738
and 100 ends up with 33,
would be around the number

00:39:00.738 --> 00:39:02.759
(indiscernible).
Professor Ben Polak: So

00:39:02.759 --> 00:39:04.309
just to repeat the argument that
we just heard.

00:39:04.309 --> 00:39:05.871
Again, you have to shout it out
more because I'm guessing people

00:39:05.871 --> 00:39:08.095
didn't hear that in room.
So I'll just repeat it to make

00:39:08.095 --> 00:39:11.272
sure everyone hears it.
A reason for choosing a number

00:39:11.272 --> 00:39:15.719
like 33 might go as follows.
If people in the room choose

00:39:15.719 --> 00:39:21.062
randomly between 1 and 100,
then the average is going to be

00:39:21.062 --> 00:39:25.760
around 50 say and two-thirds of
50 is around 33,

00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:30.259
33 1/3 actually.
So that's a pretty good piece

00:39:30.259 --> 00:39:32.586
of reasoning.
What's wrong with that

00:39:32.586 --> 00:39:34.820
reasoning?
What's wrong with that?

00:39:34.820 --> 00:39:38.872
Can we get the guy,
the woman in the striped shirt

00:39:38.872 --> 00:39:41.087
here, sorry.
We haven't had a woman for a

00:39:41.087 --> 00:39:43.090
while, so let's have a woman.
Thank you.

00:39:43.090 --> 00:39:45.760
Student: That even if
everyone else had the same

00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:48.084
reasoning as you,
it's still going to be way too

00:39:48.084 --> 00:39:49.555
high.
Professor Ben Polak: So

00:39:49.555 --> 00:39:51.026
in particular,
if everyone else had the same

00:39:51.026 --> 00:39:52.769
reasoning as you,
it's going to be way too high.

00:39:52.769 --> 00:39:56.425
So if everyone else reasons
that way then everyone in the

00:39:56.425 --> 00:40:00.211
room would choose a number like
33 or 34, and in that case,

00:40:00.211 --> 00:40:04.802
the average would be what?
Sorry, that two-thirds of the

00:40:04.802 --> 00:40:08.409
average would be what?
Something like 22.

00:40:08.409 --> 00:40:12.407
So the flaw in the argument
that Chris and Ryan had -- it

00:40:12.407 --> 00:40:15.778
isn't a bad argument,
it's a good starting point --

00:40:15.778 --> 00:40:19.354
but the flaw in the argument,
the mistake in the argument was

00:40:19.354 --> 00:40:21.619
the first sentence in the
argument.

00:40:21.619 --> 00:40:24.343
The first sentence in the
argument was,

00:40:24.343 --> 00:40:27.139
if the people in the room
choose random,

00:40:27.139 --> 00:40:29.720
then they will choose around
50.

00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:33.008
That's true.
The problem is that people in

00:40:33.008 --> 00:40:35.780
the room aren't going to choose
at random.

00:40:35.780 --> 00:40:38.019
Look around the room a second.
Look around yourselves.

00:40:38.019 --> 00:40:41.769
Do any of you look like a
random number generator?

00:40:41.769 --> 00:40:44.726
Actually, from here I can see
some of the people,

00:40:44.726 --> 00:40:48.241
but I'm not going to put.
Actually looking at some of

00:40:48.241 --> 00:40:50.710
your answers maybe some of you
are.

00:40:50.710 --> 00:40:53.136
On the whole,
Yale students are not random

00:40:53.136 --> 00:40:56.829
number generators.
They're trying to win the game.

00:40:56.829 --> 00:41:02.849
So they're unlikely to choose
numbers at random.

00:41:02.849 --> 00:41:05.518
As a further argument,
if in fact everyone thought

00:41:05.518 --> 00:41:09.004
that way, and if you figured out
everyone was going to think that

00:41:09.004 --> 00:41:11.381
way,
then you would expect everyone

00:41:11.381 --> 00:41:15.394
to choose a number like 33 and
in that case you should choose a

00:41:15.394 --> 00:41:17.222
number like 22.
How many of you,

00:41:17.222 --> 00:41:20.649
raise your hands a second.
How many of you chose numbers

00:41:20.649 --> 00:41:23.777
in the range 21 through 23?
There's way more of you than

00:41:23.777 --> 00:41:26.066
that.
I'll start reading you out as

00:41:26.066 --> 00:41:27.925
well.
Actually about twelve of you,

00:41:27.925 --> 00:41:29.947
raise your hands.
There should be twelve hands

00:41:29.947 --> 00:41:31.291
going up somewhere.
There's two,

00:41:31.291 --> 00:41:33.460
three hands going up,
four, five hands going up.

00:41:33.460 --> 00:41:37.679
There's actually 12 people who
chose exactly 22,

00:41:37.679 --> 00:41:41.630
so considerably more if include
23 and 21.

00:41:41.630 --> 00:41:43.735
So those people,
I'm guessing,

00:41:43.735 --> 00:41:46.639
were thinking this way,
is that right?

00:41:46.639 --> 00:41:50.760
Let me get one of my 22's up
again.

00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:54.220
Here's a 22.
You want to get this guy?

00:41:54.220 --> 00:41:59.639
What's your name sir?
Stand up and shout.

00:41:59.639 --> 00:42:01.976
Student: Ryan
Professor Ben Polak: You

00:42:01.976 --> 00:42:04.409
chose 22?
Student: I chose 22

00:42:04.409 --> 00:42:08.343
because I thought that most
people would play the game

00:42:08.343 --> 00:42:11.610
dividing by two-thirds a couple
of times,

00:42:11.610 --> 00:42:16.719
and give numbers averaging
around the low 30's.

00:42:16.719 --> 00:42:18.616
Professor Ben Polak: So
if you think people are going to

00:42:18.616 --> 00:42:20.806
play a particular way,
in particular if you think

00:42:20.806 --> 00:42:24.110
people are going to choose the
strategy of Ryan and Chris,

00:42:24.110 --> 00:42:28.179
and choose around 33,
then 22 seems a great answer.

00:42:28.179 --> 00:42:31.660
But you underestimate your Yale
colleagues.

00:42:31.660 --> 00:42:38.782
In fact, 22 was way too high.
Now, again, let's just iterate

00:42:38.782 --> 00:42:41.365
the point here.
Let me just repeat the point

00:42:41.365 --> 00:42:43.101
here.
The point here is when you're

00:42:43.101 --> 00:42:45.166
playing a game,
you want to think about what

00:42:45.166 --> 00:42:48.511
other people are trying to do,
to try and predict what they're

00:42:48.511 --> 00:42:50.726
trying to do,
and it's not necessarily a

00:42:50.726 --> 00:42:54.135
great starting point to assume
that the people around you are

00:42:54.135 --> 00:42:58.360
random number generators.
They have aims- trying to win,

00:42:58.360 --> 00:43:02.604
and they have strategies too.
Let me take this back to the

00:43:02.604 --> 00:43:04.969
board a second.
So, in particular,

00:43:04.969 --> 00:43:09.110
are there any strategies here
we can really rule out?

00:43:09.110 --> 00:43:11.679
We said already people are not
random.

00:43:11.679 --> 00:43:14.780
Are there any choices we can
just rule out?

00:43:14.780 --> 00:43:19.160
We know people are not going to
choose those choices.

00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:21.400
Let's have someone here.
Can we have the guy in green?

00:43:21.400 --> 00:43:23.630
Wait for Ale, there we go.
Good.

00:43:23.630 --> 00:43:26.090
Stand up.
Give me your name.

00:43:26.090 --> 00:43:27.785
Student: My name's Nick.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:43:27.785 --> 00:43:29.874
Shout it out so people can hear.
Student: No one is going

00:43:29.874 --> 00:43:31.589
to choose a number over 50.
Professor Ben Polak: No

00:43:31.589 --> 00:43:32.300
one is going to choose a number
over 50.

00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:35.890
Okay, I was going--okay that's
fair enough.

00:43:35.890 --> 00:43:41.619
Some people did.
That's fair enough.

00:43:41.619 --> 00:43:42.924
I was thinking of something a
little bit less,

00:43:42.924 --> 00:43:44.888
that's fine.
I was thinking of something a

00:43:44.888 --> 00:43:47.820
little bit less ambitious.
Somebody said 66.

00:43:47.820 --> 00:43:49.690
So let's start analyzing this.

00:44:00.440 --> 00:44:06.600
So, in particular,
there's something about these

00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:13.940
strategy choices that are
greater than 67 at any rate.

00:44:13.940 --> 00:44:17.631
Certainly, I mean 66 let's go
up a little bit,

00:44:17.631 --> 00:44:20.420
so these numbers bigger than
67.

00:44:20.420 --> 00:44:24.250
What's wrong with numbers
bigger than 67?

00:44:24.250 --> 00:44:26.010
What's wrong with--Raise your
hands if you have answer.

00:44:26.010 --> 00:44:28.393
What's wrong?
Can we get the guy in red who's

00:44:28.393 --> 00:44:30.520
right close to the mike?
Stand up, give me your name.

00:44:30.520 --> 00:44:32.200
Stand up.
Shout it out to the crowd.

00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:33.739
Student: Peter.
Professor Ben Polak: Yep.

00:44:33.739 --> 00:44:37.730
Student: If everyone
chooses a 100 it would be 67.

00:44:37.730 --> 00:44:40.436
Professor Ben Polak:
Good, so even if everyone in the

00:44:40.436 --> 00:44:43.142
number--everyone in the room
didn't choose randomly but they

00:44:43.142 --> 00:44:45.755
all chose a 100,
a very unlikely circumstance,

00:44:45.755 --> 00:44:48.679
but even if everyone had chosen
100, the highest,

00:44:48.679 --> 00:44:51.516
the average,
sorry, the highest two-thirds

00:44:51.516 --> 00:44:54.630
of the average could possibly be
is 66 2/3,

00:44:54.630 --> 00:44:57.050
hence 67 would be a pretty good
choice in that case.

00:44:57.050 --> 00:45:00.285
So numbers bigger than 67 seem
pretty crazy choices,

00:45:00.285 --> 00:45:03.329
but crazy isn't the word I'm
looking for here.

00:45:03.329 --> 00:45:07.718
What can we say about those
choices, those strategies 67 and

00:45:07.718 --> 00:45:10.469
above, bigger than 67,68 and
above?

00:45:10.469 --> 00:45:12.199
What can we say about those
choices?

00:45:12.199 --> 00:45:14.733
Somebody right behind you,
the woman right behind you,

00:45:14.733 --> 00:45:16.192
shout it out.
Student: They have no

00:45:16.192 --> 00:45:17.413
payoffs for…
Professor Ben Polak:

00:45:17.413 --> 00:45:19.650
They have no payoffs.
What's the jargon here?

00:45:19.650 --> 00:45:21.839
Let's use our jargon.
Somebody shout it out,

00:45:21.839 --> 00:45:24.590
what's the jargon about that?
They're dominated.

00:45:24.590 --> 00:45:27.260
So these strategies are
dominated.

00:45:27.260 --> 00:45:30.197
Actually, they're only weakly
dominated but that's okay,

00:45:30.197 --> 00:45:33.452
they're certainly dominated.
In particular,

00:45:33.452 --> 00:45:39.119
a strategy like 80 is dominated
by choosing 67.

00:45:39.119 --> 00:45:43.025
You will always get a higher
payoff from choosing 67,

00:45:43.025 --> 00:45:46.030
at least as high and sometimes
higher,

00:45:46.030 --> 00:45:49.171
than the payoff you would have
got, had you chosen 80,

00:45:49.171 --> 00:45:51.719
no matter what else happened in
the room.

00:45:51.719 --> 00:45:54.119
So these strategies are
dominated.

00:45:54.119 --> 00:45:57.504
We know, from the very first
lesson of the class last time,

00:45:57.504 --> 00:46:00.130
that no one should choose these
strategies.

00:46:00.130 --> 00:46:06.091
They're dominated strategies.
So did anyone choose strategies

00:46:06.091 --> 00:46:09.839
bigger than 67?
Okay, I'm not going to read out

00:46:09.839 --> 00:46:12.789
names here, but,
turns out four of you did.

00:46:12.789 --> 00:46:15.699
I'm not going to make you wave
your--okay.

00:46:15.699 --> 00:46:20.679
So okay, for the four of you
who did, never mind,

00:46:20.679 --> 00:46:23.896
but …
well mind actually,

00:46:23.896 --> 00:46:27.533
yeah.
So once we've eliminated the

00:46:27.533 --> 00:46:32.843
possibility that anyone in the
room is going to choose a

00:46:32.843 --> 00:46:38.218
strategy bigger than 67,
it's as if those numbers 68

00:46:38.218 --> 00:46:43.199
through 100 are irrelevant.
It's really as if the game is

00:46:43.199 --> 00:46:47.345
being played where the only
choices available on the table

00:46:47.345 --> 00:46:50.780
are 1 through 67.
Is that right?

00:46:50.780 --> 00:46:52.622
We know no one's going to
choose 68 and above,

00:46:52.622 --> 00:46:56.432
so we can just forget them.
We can delete those strategies

00:46:56.432 --> 00:47:01.241
and once we delete those
strategies, all that's left are

00:47:01.241 --> 00:47:04.610
choices 1 through 67.
So can somebody help me out now?

00:47:04.610 --> 00:47:07.543
What can I conclude,
now I've concluded that the

00:47:07.543 --> 00:47:11.038
strategies 68 through 100
essentially don't exist or have

00:47:11.038 --> 00:47:14.119
been deleted.
What can I conclude?

00:47:14.119 --> 00:47:15.590
Let me see if I can get a mike
in here.

00:47:15.590 --> 00:47:19.860
Stand up and wait for the mike.
And here comes the mike.

00:47:19.860 --> 00:47:21.449
Good.
Shout out.

00:47:21.449 --> 00:47:23.538
Student: That all
strategies 45 and above are

00:47:23.538 --> 00:47:25.549
hence also ruled out.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:47:25.549 --> 00:47:27.527
Good, so your name is?
Student: Henry

00:47:27.527 --> 00:47:30.374
Professor Ben Polak: So
Henry is saying once we've

00:47:30.374 --> 00:47:33.373
figured out that no one should
choose a strategy bigger than

00:47:33.373 --> 00:47:36.256
67,
then we can go another step and

00:47:36.256 --> 00:47:41.129
say, if those strategies never
existed, then the same argument

00:47:41.129 --> 00:47:45.682
rules out -- or a similar
argument rules out -- strategies

00:47:45.682 --> 00:47:48.760
bigger than 45.
Let's be careful here.

00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:54.332
The strategies that are less
than 67 but bigger than 45,

00:47:54.332 --> 00:47:59.802
I think these strategies are
not, they're not dominated

00:47:59.802 --> 00:48:04.187
strategies in the original game.
In particular,

00:48:04.187 --> 00:48:07.085
we just argued that if everyone
in the room chose a 100,

00:48:07.085 --> 00:48:09.139
then 67 would be a winning
strategy.

00:48:09.139 --> 00:48:14.230
So it's not the case that the
strategies between 45 and 67 are

00:48:14.230 --> 00:48:18.716
dominated strategies.
But it is the case that they're

00:48:18.716 --> 00:48:22.773
dominated once we delete the
dominated strategies:

00:48:22.773 --> 00:48:29.707
once we delete 67 and above.
So these strategies -- let's be

00:48:29.707 --> 00:48:37.737
careful here with the word
weakly here -- these strategies

00:48:37.737 --> 00:48:44.639
are not weakly dominated in the
original game.

00:48:44.639 --> 00:48:57.186
But they are dominated --
they're weakly dominated -- once

00:48:57.186 --> 00:49:06.217
we delete 68 through 100.
So all of the strategies 45

00:49:06.217 --> 00:49:11.510
through 67, are gone now.
So okay, let's have a look.

00:49:11.510 --> 00:49:14.920
Did anyone choose -- raise your
hands, Be brave here.

00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:22.970
Did anyone choose a strategy
between 45 and 67?

00:49:22.970 --> 00:49:25.833
Or between 46 and 67?
No one's raising their hand,

00:49:25.833 --> 00:49:27.639
but I know some of you did
because I got it in front of me,

00:49:27.639 --> 00:49:30.579
at least four of you did and I
won't read out those names yet,

00:49:30.579 --> 00:49:32.409
but I might read them out next
time.

00:49:32.409 --> 00:49:37.179
So four more people chose those
strategies.

00:49:37.179 --> 00:49:40.054
Now notice, there's a different
part of this,

00:49:40.054 --> 00:49:42.938
this argument.
The argument that eliminates

00:49:42.938 --> 00:49:45.432
strategies 67 and above,
or 68 upwards,

00:49:45.432 --> 00:49:49.174
that strategy just involves the
first lesson of last time:

00:49:49.174 --> 00:49:51.800
do not choose a dominated
strategy,

00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:56.581
admittedly weak here, but still.
But the second slice,

00:49:56.581 --> 00:50:01.627
strategies 45 through 67,
getting rid of those strategies

00:50:01.627 --> 00:50:06.597
involves a little bit more.
You've got to put yourself in

00:50:06.597 --> 00:50:10.349
the shoes of your fellow
classmen and figure out,

00:50:10.349 --> 00:50:14.179
that they're not going to
choose 67 and above.

00:50:14.179 --> 00:50:16.199
So the first argument,
that's a straight forward

00:50:16.199 --> 00:50:17.789
argument, the second argument
says,

00:50:17.789 --> 00:50:20.864
I put myself in other peoples
shoes, I realize they're not

00:50:20.864 --> 00:50:22.860
going to play a dominated
strategy,

00:50:22.860 --> 00:50:24.389
and therefore,
having realized they're not

00:50:24.389 --> 00:50:25.769
going to play a dominated
strategy,

00:50:25.769 --> 00:50:29.840
I shouldn't play a strategy
between 45 and 67.

00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:36.940
So this argument is an 'in
shoes' argument.

00:50:36.940 --> 00:50:39.929
Now what?
Where can we go now?

00:50:39.929 --> 00:50:44.452
Yeah, so let's have the guy in
the beard, but let the mike get

00:50:44.452 --> 00:50:46.519
to him.
Yell out your name.

00:50:46.519 --> 00:50:49.055
Student: You just repeat
the same reasoning again and

00:50:49.055 --> 00:50:50.860
again, and you eventually get
down to 1.

00:50:50.860 --> 00:50:53.224
Professor Ben Polak:
We'll do that but let's go one

00:50:53.224 --> 00:50:55.052
step at a time.
So now we've ruled out the

00:50:55.052 --> 00:50:57.556
possibility that anyone's going
to choose a strategy 68 and

00:50:57.556 --> 00:50:59.369
above because they're weakly
dominated,

00:50:59.369 --> 00:51:01.984
and we've ruled out the
possibility that anyone's going

00:51:01.984 --> 00:51:03.969
to choose a strategy between 46
and 67,

00:51:03.969 --> 00:51:06.480
because those strategies are
dominated, once we've ruled out

00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:09.138
the dominated strategies.
So we know no one's choosing

00:51:09.138 --> 00:51:12.048
any strategies above 45.,
It's as if the numbers 46 and

00:51:12.048 --> 00:51:15.056
above don't exist.
So we know that the highest

00:51:15.056 --> 00:51:19.364
anyone could ever choose is 45,
and two-thirds of 45 is roughly

00:51:19.364 --> 00:51:22.213
… someone help me out
here …

00:51:22.213 --> 00:51:28.684
30 right: roughly 30.
So we know that all the numbers

00:51:28.684 --> 00:51:35.154
between 45 and 30,
these strategies were not

00:51:35.154 --> 00:51:38.909
dominated.
And they weren't dominated even

00:51:38.909 --> 00:51:41.289
after deleting the dominated
strategies.

00:51:41.289 --> 00:51:44.233
But they are dominated once we
deleted not just the dominated

00:51:44.233 --> 00:51:46.882
strategies, but also the
strategies that were dominated

00:51:46.882 --> 00:51:49.090
once we deleted the dominated
strategies.

00:51:49.090 --> 00:51:51.626
I'm not going to try and write
that, but you should try and

00:51:51.626 --> 00:51:54.176
write it in your notes.
So without writing that

00:51:54.176 --> 00:51:57.658
argument down in detail,
notice that we can rule out the

00:51:57.658 --> 00:52:01.076
strategies 30 through 45,
not by just examining our own

00:52:01.076 --> 00:52:03.176
payoffs;
not just by putting ourselves

00:52:03.176 --> 00:52:05.685
in other people's shoes and
realizing they're not going to

00:52:05.685 --> 00:52:08.604
choose a dominated strategy;
but by putting our self in

00:52:08.604 --> 00:52:11.893
other people's shoes while
they're putting themselves in

00:52:11.893 --> 00:52:15.182
someone else's shoes and
figuring out what they're going

00:52:15.182 --> 00:52:18.341
to do.
So this is an 'in shoes',

00:52:18.341 --> 00:52:24.245
be careful where we are here,
this is an 'in shoes in shoes'

00:52:24.245 --> 00:52:30.450
argument, at which point you
might want to invent the sock.

00:52:30.450 --> 00:52:32.849
Now, where's this going?
We were told where it's going.

00:52:32.849 --> 00:52:35.190
We're able to rule out 68 and
above.

00:52:35.190 --> 00:52:37.179
Then we were able to rule out
46 and above.

00:52:37.179 --> 00:52:41.429
Now we're able to rule out 31
and above.

00:52:41.429 --> 00:52:45.777
By the next slice down we'll be
able to eliminate -- what is it

00:52:45.777 --> 00:52:51.685
-- about 20 and above,
so 30 down to above 20,

00:52:51.685 --> 00:53:01.239
and this will be an 'in shoes,
in shoes, in shoes'.

00:53:01.239 --> 00:53:03.363
These strategies aren't
dominated, nor are they

00:53:03.363 --> 00:53:05.809
dominated once you delete the
dominated strategies,

00:53:05.809 --> 00:53:07.637
nor once we dominated the
strategies dominated once we've

00:53:07.637 --> 00:53:08.780
deleted the dominated
strategies,

00:53:08.780 --> 00:53:11.664
but they are dominated once we
delete the strategies that have

00:53:11.664 --> 00:53:14.170
been dominated in the--you get
what I'm doing here.

00:53:14.170 --> 00:53:16.309
So where is this argument going
to go?

00:53:16.309 --> 00:53:19.469
Where's this argument going to
go?

00:53:19.469 --> 00:53:22.725
It's going to go all the way
down to 1: all the way down to

00:53:22.725 --> 00:53:23.808
1.
We could repeat this argument

00:53:23.808 --> 00:53:26.277
all the way down to 1.
Notice that once we've deleted

00:53:26.277 --> 00:53:29.316
the dominated strategies,
you know I had said before

00:53:29.316 --> 00:53:31.760
about four people chose this
strategy,

00:53:31.760 --> 00:53:35.036
and in here,
about four people chose this

00:53:35.036 --> 00:53:38.640
strategy, but in this range 30
through 45,

00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:42.863
I had lots of people.
How many of you chose a number

00:53:42.863 --> 00:53:45.230
between 30 and 45?
Well more than that.

00:53:45.230 --> 00:53:48.171
I can guarantee you more than
that chose a number between 30

00:53:48.171 --> 00:53:50.309
and 45.
In fact, the people who chose

00:53:50.309 --> 00:53:52.929
where we started off 33 chose in
that range.

00:53:52.929 --> 00:53:55.681
A lot more of you chose numbers
between 20 and 30,

00:53:55.681 --> 00:53:59.050
so we're really getting into
the meat of the distribution.

00:53:59.050 --> 00:54:03.089
But we're seeing that these are
choices, that perhaps,

00:54:03.089 --> 00:54:06.289
are ruled out by this kind of
reasoning.

00:54:06.289 --> 00:54:09.449
Now, I'm still not going to
quite reveal yet who won.

00:54:09.449 --> 00:54:12.820
I want to take this just one
step more abstract.

00:54:12.820 --> 00:54:14.739
So I want to just discuss this
a little bit more.

00:54:14.739 --> 00:54:18.601
I want to discuss the
consequence of rationality in

00:54:18.601 --> 00:54:21.844
playing games,
slightly philosophical for a

00:54:21.844 --> 00:54:24.647
few minutes.
So I claim that if you are a

00:54:24.647 --> 00:54:27.278
rational player,
by which I mean somebody who is

00:54:27.278 --> 00:54:30.750
trying to maximize their payoffs
by their play of the game,

00:54:30.750 --> 00:54:37.894
that simply being rational,
just being a rational player,

00:54:37.894 --> 00:54:43.889
rules out playing these
dominated strategies.

00:54:43.889 --> 00:54:47.916
So the four of you who chose
numbers bigger than 67,

00:54:47.916 --> 00:54:52.654
whose names I'm not going to
read out, maybe they were making

00:54:52.654 --> 00:54:57.201
a mistake.
However, the next slice down

00:54:57.201 --> 00:55:01.750
requires more than just
rationality.

00:55:01.750 --> 00:55:07.794
What else does it require?
Yes, can I get this guy again,

00:55:07.794 --> 00:55:09.174
sorry?
Shout out your name again,

00:55:09.174 --> 00:55:10.690
I've forgotten it.
Student: Nick.

00:55:10.690 --> 00:55:11.470
Professor Ben Polak:
Shout it out.

00:55:11.470 --> 00:55:12.710
Student: Nick.
Professor Ben Polak: Yep.

00:55:12.710 --> 00:55:14.427
Student: The assumption
that your opponents are being

00:55:14.427 --> 00:55:16.231
rational as well.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:55:16.231 --> 00:55:20.938
Good.
To rule out the second slice,

00:55:20.938 --> 00:55:29.946
I need to be rational myself,
and I need to know that others

00:55:29.946 --> 00:55:33.600
are rational.
That's illegible,

00:55:33.600 --> 00:55:37.800
but what it says is rational
and knowledge that other people

00:55:37.800 --> 00:55:40.402
are rational.
Now how about the next slice

00:55:40.402 --> 00:55:43.513
after that?
Well now I need to be rational,

00:55:43.513 --> 00:55:47.280
I need to know that other
people are rational,

00:55:47.280 --> 00:55:51.983
and I need to know that other
people know that other people

00:55:51.983 --> 00:55:54.730
are rational.
So to get this slice,

00:55:54.730 --> 00:55:57.789
this next slice here,
I need rationality;

00:55:57.789 --> 00:55:59.889
as some of you know that's
widely criticized in the social

00:55:59.889 --> 00:56:01.993
sciences these days.
Are we right to assume that

00:56:01.993 --> 00:56:05.370
people are rational?
To get this slice I need

00:56:05.370 --> 00:56:11.593
rationality, I need knowledge of
rationality, let's call that KR

00:56:11.593 --> 00:56:16.730
and I need knowledge of
knowledge of rationality.

00:56:16.730 --> 00:56:19.239
As I go down further,
I'm going to need rationality,

00:56:19.239 --> 00:56:21.059
I need to know people are
rational;

00:56:21.059 --> 00:56:24.465
I need to know that people know
that people are rational,

00:56:24.465 --> 00:56:27.870
and I need to know that people
know that people know that

00:56:27.870 --> 00:56:30.687
people are rational.
Now let's just make this more

00:56:30.687 --> 00:56:33.464
concrete for you.
These people,

00:56:33.464 --> 00:56:41.349
the four people who chose this,
they made a mistake.

00:56:41.349 --> 00:56:45.260
What about the four people who
chose numbers between 45 and 67?

00:56:45.260 --> 00:56:47.389
What can we conclude about
those people?

00:56:47.389 --> 00:56:50.490
The people who chose between 45
and 67?

00:56:50.490 --> 00:56:53.292
Should I read out their names?
No, I won't,

00:56:53.292 --> 00:56:56.333
perhaps I better not.
What can we conclude about

00:56:56.333 --> 00:56:57.650
these people?
Yeah.

00:56:57.650 --> 00:56:59.451
We're never going to get the
mike to this -- try and get the

00:56:59.451 --> 00:57:01.465
mike in there.
Come forward as far as you can

00:57:01.465 --> 00:57:02.889
and then really shout,
yep.

00:57:02.889 --> 00:57:04.550
Student: They think
their classmates are pretty

00:57:04.550 --> 00:57:05.547
dumb.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:57:05.547 --> 00:57:08.312
Right, right.
It's not necessarily that the

00:57:08.312 --> 00:57:13.363
four people who chose between 46
and 67 are themselves "thick,"

00:57:13.363 --> 00:57:17.599
it's that they think the rest of
you are "thick."

00:57:17.599 --> 00:57:20.105
Down here, this doesn't require
people to be thick,

00:57:20.105 --> 00:57:22.110
or to think the rest of you are
thick,

00:57:22.110 --> 00:57:24.230
they're just people who think
that you think,

00:57:24.230 --> 00:57:26.880
sorry, they're just people who
think that you think that

00:57:26.880 --> 00:57:29.627
they're thick and so on.
But again, all the way to 1

00:57:29.627 --> 00:57:32.474
we're going to need very,
very many rounds of knowledge,

00:57:32.474 --> 00:57:34.234
of knowledge,
of knowledge …

00:57:34.234 --> 00:57:36.896
of rationality.
Does anyone know what we call

00:57:36.896 --> 00:57:39.980
it if we assume an infinite
sequence of "I know that you

00:57:39.980 --> 00:57:43.457
know that I know that you know
that I know that you know that I

00:57:43.457 --> 00:57:47.820
know that you know" something?
What's the expression for that?

00:57:47.820 --> 00:57:50.760
Believe it or not,
technical expression.

00:57:50.760 --> 00:57:55.968
The technical expression of
that in philosophy is common

00:57:55.968 --> 00:58:01.840
knowledge, which I can never
spell, so I'm going to wing it.

00:58:01.840 --> 00:58:03.686
Common knowledge is:
"I know something,

00:58:03.686 --> 00:58:05.436
you know it,
you know that I know it,

00:58:05.436 --> 00:58:07.914
I know that you know it,
I know that you know that I

00:58:07.914 --> 00:58:09.130
know it, etc.,
etc.

00:58:09.130 --> 00:58:16.563
etc.: an infinite sequence.
But if we had common knowledge

00:58:16.563 --> 00:58:22.178
of rationality in this class,
then the optimal choice would

00:58:22.178 --> 00:58:26.890
have been 1.
How many of you chose 1?

00:58:26.890 --> 00:58:28.180
Look around the room.
Let's just pan the room.

00:58:28.180 --> 00:58:32.500
Keep your hands up a second.
How many of you chose 1?

00:58:32.500 --> 00:58:34.210
So actually a lot of you chose
1.

00:58:34.210 --> 00:58:36.150
1 was the modal answer in this
class.

00:58:36.150 --> 00:58:40.260
A lot of you chose 1.
So those people did pretty well.

00:58:40.260 --> 00:58:45.202
They must have done--they must
be thinking they're about to

00:58:45.202 --> 00:58:50.107
win… but they didn't win.
So it turns out that the

00:58:50.107 --> 00:58:54.540
average in this class,
the average choice was about 13

00:58:54.540 --> 00:58:58.889
1/3, which means two-thirds of
the average was 9.

00:58:58.889 --> 00:59:02.612
Two-thirds of the average was 9
and some of you chose 9,

00:59:02.612 --> 00:59:04.710
so if you are here,
stand up.

00:59:04.710 --> 00:59:07.225
The following people chose 9,
that's not right,

00:59:07.225 --> 00:59:09.140
where are the people who chose
9?

00:59:09.140 --> 00:59:11.636
I've got them here somewhere?
I'm sorry there's so many pages

00:59:11.636 --> 00:59:12.570
of people.
Here we go.

00:59:12.570 --> 00:59:15.480
The following people chose 9.
So stand up if you're here and

00:59:15.480 --> 00:59:18.630
if you're that person's roommate
if they're not here.

00:59:18.630 --> 00:59:20.940
So Leesing Chang:
is Leesing Chang here?

00:59:20.940 --> 00:59:23.039
Stand up if you're here.
A G.

00:59:23.039 --> 00:59:25.158
Christopher Berrera:
you can stand up,

00:59:25.158 --> 00:59:28.695
if you're here.
And William Fischel:

00:59:28.695 --> 00:59:31.260
are you here?
I don't know if he is here.

00:59:31.260 --> 00:59:33.713
Jed Glickstein: are you here?
Jed Glickstein:

00:59:33.713 --> 00:59:36.563
stand up if you're here.
And Jeffrey Green:

00:59:36.563 --> 00:59:40.090
stand up if you're here.
And Allison Hoyt:

00:59:40.090 --> 00:59:44.410
stand up if you're here.
No Allison Hoyt, okay.

00:59:44.410 --> 00:59:50.588
There's John Robinson.
All right so these people,

00:59:50.588 --> 00:59:53.699
stay up a second so the camera
can see you.

00:59:53.699 --> 00:59:56.140
There you go,
all the way around.

00:59:56.140 --> 00:59:59.420
Wave.
Wave to mom at home.

00:59:59.420 --> 01:00:01.070
Can we get a round of applause
for our winners?

01:00:09.630 --> 01:00:12.880
So Jude has trustworthily
brought back the five dollars.

01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:14.639
I've got to focus for a second
just to get it.

01:00:14.639 --> 01:00:16.723
Here is the five dollars,
we're going to tear this into

01:00:16.723 --> 01:00:18.922
nine pieces, except I'd get
arrested and deported if I did

01:00:18.922 --> 01:00:20.728
that,
so we're going to find a way to

01:00:20.728 --> 01:00:24.618
break this into change later.
Come and claim it afterwards,

01:00:24.618 --> 01:00:28.293
but you're all entitled to
whatever a ninth,

01:00:28.293 --> 01:00:32.139
whatever that fraction of five
dollars is.

01:00:32.139 --> 01:00:37.165
Okay, so why was it after all
that work -- why was it that 1

01:00:37.165 --> 01:00:41.070
wasn't the winning answer?
Why wasn't 1 the winning answer?

01:00:41.070 --> 01:00:42.320
Let's have someone we haven't
had before.

01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:45.429
Can we get the mike in way in
the back there?

01:00:45.429 --> 01:00:48.330
Can we get the mike in there on
the row you're on?

01:00:48.330 --> 01:00:50.040
See if you can point.
Actually good.

01:00:50.040 --> 01:00:52.620
Stand up.
Shout.

01:00:52.620 --> 01:00:54.191
Shout away.
Student: 1 would have

01:00:54.191 --> 01:00:54.909
been the winning answer
[inaudible]

01:00:54.909 --> 01:00:55.796
Professor Ben Polak:
Louder, louder,

01:00:55.796 --> 01:00:57.905
louder.
Student: 1 would have

01:00:57.905 --> 01:01:01.350
been the winning answer had
everyone assumed that the

01:01:01.350 --> 01:01:05.260
average would have been
constantly compounded down to 1,

01:01:05.260 --> 01:01:10.005
but since a couple of people
chose the, I mean not incorrect

01:01:10.005 --> 01:01:12.820
answers, but the higher
averages,

01:01:12.820 --> 01:01:16.144
then it was pushed up to 13.
Professor Ben Polak:

01:01:16.144 --> 01:01:17.675
Right, so to get all the way,
-- good -- so to get all the

01:01:17.675 --> 01:01:18.909
way -- thank you -- So to get
all the way to 1,

01:01:18.909 --> 01:01:20.392
we need a lot.
We need not just that you're

01:01:20.392 --> 01:01:22.060
all rational players,
not just that you know each

01:01:22.060 --> 01:01:23.623
other's rational,
but you know everyone else's

01:01:23.623 --> 01:01:25.073
rational.
I mean I know you all know each

01:01:25.073 --> 01:01:26.783
other because you've met at
Yale, but you also know each

01:01:26.783 --> 01:01:28.554
other well enough to know that
not everyone in the room is

01:01:28.554 --> 01:01:30.073
rational,
and you're pretty sure that not

01:01:30.073 --> 01:01:32.170
everyone knows that you're
rational and so on and so forth.

01:01:32.170 --> 01:01:34.734
It's asking a lot to get to 1
here, and in fact,

01:01:34.734 --> 01:01:37.795
we didn't get to 1.
In previous years we were even

01:01:37.795 --> 01:01:40.030
higher, so this was low this
year.

01:01:40.030 --> 01:01:43.889
In 2003, the average was
eighteen and a half.

01:01:43.889 --> 01:01:45.880
And in 2004,
it was twenty-one and a half.

01:01:45.880 --> 01:01:47.818
And in 2005,
we had a class that didn't

01:01:47.818 --> 01:01:50.623
trust each other at all I guess,
because the average was

01:01:50.623 --> 01:01:52.053
twenty-three.
And this year,

01:01:52.053 --> 01:01:55.739
it was thirteen and a third.
We're getting better there I

01:01:55.739 --> 01:01:57.166
think.
One nice thing,

01:01:57.166 --> 01:02:00.031
by the way -- this is just
chance I think -- the median

01:02:00.031 --> 01:02:02.958
answer in the class was nine,
which is spot on,

01:02:02.958 --> 01:02:07.174
so the median hit this bang on.
Now what I wanted you to do,

01:02:07.174 --> 01:02:09.420
is I want you all to play
again.

01:02:09.420 --> 01:02:11.962
We haven't got time to do this
properly, even though I've given

01:02:11.962 --> 01:02:15.338
you the sheets.
So write down -- don't tell

01:02:15.338 --> 01:02:20.000
this to your neighbors -- write
down a number.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:21.300
Don't talk among yourselves
that's cheating.

01:02:21.300 --> 01:02:25.882
Write down a number.
If you haven't got a sheet in

01:02:25.882 --> 01:02:27.220
front of you,
just write it on your notepad.

01:02:27.220 --> 01:02:30.502
Write down a number.
Has everyone written down a

01:02:30.502 --> 01:02:32.802
number?
I'm going to do a show of hands

01:02:32.802 --> 01:02:35.614
now.
How many -- we'll get the

01:02:35.614 --> 01:02:42.050
camera on you -- how many of you
chose a number higher than 67?

01:02:42.050 --> 01:02:44.119
Oh there's some spoil makers in
the class.

01:02:44.119 --> 01:02:48.960
How many of you chose a number
higher than 20?

01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:53.860
How many of you chose a number
higher than 10?

01:02:53.860 --> 01:02:58.260
How many chose a number between
5 and 10?

01:02:58.260 --> 01:03:04.375
How many chose a number between
0 -- I'm sorry -- between 1 and

01:03:04.375 --> 01:03:05.686
5?
How many of you,

01:03:05.686 --> 01:03:09.008
excluding the people who chose
1 last time, how many of you

01:03:09.008 --> 01:03:12.387
chose a number that was lower
than the number you chose last

01:03:12.387 --> 01:03:15.520
time?
Now keep your hands up a second.

01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:19.530
So almost all of you came down.
Why?

01:03:19.530 --> 01:03:22.489
Why are seeing this massive
contraction?

01:03:22.489 --> 01:03:25.324
I'm guessing the average number
in the class now is probably

01:03:25.324 --> 01:03:26.909
about 3 or 4,
maybe even lower.

01:03:26.909 --> 01:03:29.966
Why are we seeing this massive
contraction in the numbers being

01:03:29.966 --> 01:03:31.784
chosen?
The woman in green,

01:03:31.784 --> 01:03:34.460
I've forgotten your name,
I'm sorry?

01:03:34.460 --> 01:03:36.934
Student: Because we've
just sat in lecture and you've

01:03:36.934 --> 01:03:39.449
told us we're not being rational
if we pick a high number.

01:03:39.449 --> 01:03:41.863
Professor Ben Polak: So
part of it is,

01:03:41.863 --> 01:03:44.276
you yourselves have figured
out, some of you,

01:03:44.276 --> 01:03:46.690
that you shouldn't choose a
high number.

01:03:46.690 --> 01:03:50.120
What else though?
What else is going on here?

01:03:50.120 --> 01:03:54.266
Let's get somebody.
There's a guy waving an arm out

01:03:54.266 --> 01:03:55.800
there.
Do you want to stand up behind

01:03:55.800 --> 01:03:59.510
the hat?
You.

01:03:59.510 --> 01:04:01.570
Student: Because we've
repeated the game.

01:04:01.570 --> 01:04:03.110
Professor Ben Polak:
It's true we've repeated it.

01:04:03.110 --> 01:04:05.610
It's true we repeated it but
what is it about repeating it?

01:04:05.610 --> 01:04:08.137
What is it about talking about
this game that makes a

01:04:08.137 --> 01:04:09.969
difference?
Let me hazard a guess here.

01:04:09.969 --> 01:04:13.092
I think what makes a difference
is not only do you,

01:04:13.092 --> 01:04:16.340
yourselves, know better how to
play this game now,

01:04:16.340 --> 01:04:20.112
but you also know that
everybody around you knows

01:04:20.112 --> 01:04:24.850
better how to play the game.
Discussing this game raised not

01:04:24.850 --> 01:04:27.384
just each person's
sophistication,

01:04:27.384 --> 01:04:30.994
but it raised what you know
about other people's

01:04:30.994 --> 01:04:34.189
sophistication,
and you know that other people

01:04:34.189 --> 01:04:37.010
now know that you understand how
to play the game.

01:04:37.010 --> 01:04:40.159
So the main lesson I want you
to get from this is that not

01:04:40.159 --> 01:04:43.254
only did it matter that you need
to put yourself in other

01:04:43.254 --> 01:04:46.460
people's shoes and think about
what their payoffs are.

01:04:46.460 --> 01:04:50.780
You also need to put yourself
into other people's shoes and

01:04:50.780 --> 01:04:55.099
think about how sophisticated
are they at playing games.

01:04:55.099 --> 01:04:58.892
And you need to think about how
sophisticated do they think you

01:04:58.892 --> 01:05:01.815
are at playing games.
And you need to think about how

01:05:01.815 --> 01:05:04.650
sophisticated do they think that
you think that they are at

01:05:04.650 --> 01:05:07.563
playing games and so on.
This level of knowledge,

01:05:07.563 --> 01:05:11.283
these layers of knowledge,
lead to very different play in

01:05:11.283 --> 01:05:14.041
the game.
And to make this more concrete,

01:05:14.041 --> 01:05:17.773
if a firm is competing against
a competitor it can be pretty

01:05:17.773 --> 01:05:19.804
sure,
that competitor is a pretty

01:05:19.804 --> 01:05:23.250
sophisticated game player and
knows that the firm is itself.

01:05:23.250 --> 01:05:26.823
If a firm is competing against
a customer -- let's say for a

01:05:26.823 --> 01:05:30.760
non-prime loan -- perhaps that
assumption is not quite so safe.

01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:33.991
It matters in how we take games
through to the real world,

01:05:33.991 --> 01:05:37.449
and we're going to see more of
this as the term progresses.

01:05:37.449 --> 01:05:41.550
Now I've got five minutes,
do I have five minutes left?

01:05:41.550 --> 01:05:45.130
So I've got five minutes to
take a little small aside here.

01:05:45.130 --> 01:05:48.307
We've been talking about
knowledge and about common

01:05:48.307 --> 01:05:50.630
knowledge.
I just want to do a very quick

01:05:50.630 --> 01:05:52.920
experiment, so everyone stay in
their seat.

01:05:52.920 --> 01:05:56.993
I'm going to get two T.A.'s up
here, why don't I get Ale and

01:05:56.993 --> 01:05:59.646
Kaj up here.
And I wanted to show that

01:05:59.646 --> 01:06:02.953
common knowledge is not such an
obvious a concept,

01:06:02.953 --> 01:06:05.450
as I've made it seem on the
board.

01:06:05.450 --> 01:06:10.199
Come up on the stage a second.
You can leave the mike its okay.

01:06:10.199 --> 01:06:13.345
Here we have two of our T.A.'s,
actually these are the two head

01:06:13.345 --> 01:06:16.339
T.A.'s, and I want you to face
forward so you don't see what

01:06:16.339 --> 01:06:22.222
I'm doing.
I'm about to put on their heads

01:06:22.222 --> 01:06:25.687
a hat.
Here's a hat on Ale's head,

01:06:25.687 --> 01:06:30.329
and here's a hat on Kaj's head.
Let's move them this way so

01:06:30.329 --> 01:06:33.841
they're in focus.
Now you can all see these hats,

01:06:33.841 --> 01:06:38.376
and if they turn around to each
other, they can see each other's

01:06:38.376 --> 01:06:40.723
hat.
Now I want to ask you the

01:06:40.723 --> 01:06:43.762
question here.
Here is a fact,

01:06:43.762 --> 01:06:51.491
so is it common knowledge that
-- is it common knowledge that

01:06:51.491 --> 01:06:59.350
at least one of these people has
a pink hat on their head?

01:06:59.350 --> 01:07:03.367
Is it common knowledge?
So I claim it's not common

01:07:03.367 --> 01:07:06.000
knowledge.
What is known here?

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:11.409
Well I'll reveal the facts now:
that in fact Ale knows that Kaj

01:07:11.409 --> 01:07:15.086
has a pink hat on his head.
So it's true that Ale knows

01:07:15.086 --> 01:07:17.590
that at least one person in the
room has a pink hat on their

01:07:17.590 --> 01:07:19.571
head.
And it's true that Kaj knows

01:07:19.571 --> 01:07:21.739
that Ale has a pink hat on his
head.

01:07:21.739 --> 01:07:24.619
They both look absurd,
but never mind.

01:07:24.619 --> 01:07:30.705
But notice that Ale doesn't
know the color of the hat on his

01:07:30.705 --> 01:07:33.662
own head.
So even though both people

01:07:33.662 --> 01:07:37.937
know, even though it is mutual
knowledge that there's at least

01:07:37.937 --> 01:07:42.388
one pink hat in the room,
Ale doesn't know what Kaj is

01:07:42.388 --> 01:07:45.045
seeing.
So Ale does not know that Kaj

01:07:45.045 --> 01:07:47.929
knows that there's a pink hat in
the room.

01:07:47.929 --> 01:07:51.449
In fact, from Ale's point of
view, this could be a blue hat.

01:07:51.449 --> 01:07:55.312
So again, they both know that
someone in the room has a pink

01:07:55.312 --> 01:07:58.258
hat on their head:
it is mutual knowledge that

01:07:58.258 --> 01:08:02.885
there's a pink hat in the room.
But Ale does not know that Kaj

01:08:02.885 --> 01:08:07.556
knows that he is wearing a blue,
a pink hat, and Kaj does not

01:08:07.556 --> 01:08:11.760
know that Ale knows that Kaj is
wearing a pink hat.

01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:15.869
Each of their hats -- each of
their own hats -- might be blue.

01:08:15.869 --> 01:08:19.057
So notice that common knowledge
-- thanks guys -- common

01:08:19.057 --> 01:08:21.840
knowledge is a rather subtle
thing, thank you.

01:08:21.840 --> 01:08:23.430
Common knowledge is a subtle
thing.

01:08:23.430 --> 01:08:26.659
Mutual knowledge doesn't imply
common knowledge.

01:08:26.659 --> 01:08:29.489
Common knowledge is a statement
about not just what I know.

01:08:29.489 --> 01:08:32.129
It's about what do I know the
other person knows that I know

01:08:32.129 --> 01:08:34.590
that the other person
…and so on and so forth.

01:08:34.590 --> 01:08:37.029
Even in this simple example,
while you might think it's

01:08:37.029 --> 01:08:39.648
obviously common knowledge,
it wasn't common knowledge that

01:08:39.648 --> 01:08:41.319
there was a pink hat in the
room.

01:08:41.319 --> 01:08:44.389
Does anybody have smaller
siblings or children of their

01:08:44.389 --> 01:08:45.995
own.
They can have a pink hat at the

01:08:45.995 --> 01:08:49.000
end of the class?
We'll see you on Wednesday.

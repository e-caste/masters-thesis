00:00:01.533 --> 00:00:03.833
RONALD SMITH: Well, we're going
to finish up the course by

00:00:03.833 --> 00:00:05.067
talking about energy.

00:00:06.067 --> 00:00:09.067
It's one of the primary--our
need for energy is one of the

00:00:09.067 --> 00:00:14.967
primary ways that we interact
with the environment, both

00:00:14.967 --> 00:00:18.433
draw resources from it,
but also influence the

00:00:18.433 --> 00:00:19.067
environment.

00:00:19.067 --> 00:00:25.700
So I think it's a fitting way
to end up the course.

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.200
Today I'll probably just
get through these two.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.800
Although, so I've put hydropower
down here and

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.967
renewable for the future.

00:00:32.967 --> 00:00:34.733
But it's a big player today.

00:00:34.733 --> 00:00:38.067
So I'll probably talk about
hydropower today.

00:00:38.067 --> 00:00:44.100
But the rest will be discussed
mostly on Wednesday.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.933
Now, over here, then, is the
cartoon that will kind of

00:00:49.933 --> 00:00:52.300
remind us where everything
fits in this

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:57.867
picture of energy resources.

00:00:57.867 --> 00:01:03.400
Hydroelectric comes from rain
falling on high ground, so it

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.633
has potential energy.

00:01:04.633 --> 00:01:07.767
If it falls at sea level,
you can't get any

00:01:07.767 --> 00:01:08.867
hydro energy from it.

00:01:08.867 --> 00:01:11.833
But if it falls at a high
altitude, you've got that

00:01:11.833 --> 00:01:15.167
potential energy to draw from.

00:01:15.167 --> 00:01:19.233
The sun, through photosynthesis,
will allow

00:01:19.233 --> 00:01:20.100
plants to grow.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.633
And then you can use
that biomass in

00:01:22.633 --> 00:01:24.933
several different ways.

00:01:24.933 --> 00:01:31.067
Direct conversion of solar
to, say, electricity.

00:01:31.067 --> 00:01:35.000
The differential heating from
the sun, as you know, can

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.933
create the winds.

00:01:36.933 --> 00:01:40.967
And the winds can turn
a wind turbine.

00:01:40.967 --> 00:01:44.500
The winds also produce
waves on the ocean.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:51.500
And those waves can be used
to generate electricity.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:57.867
The heat from the sun also
creates a temperature

00:01:57.867 --> 00:02:00.133
difference within the oceans.

00:02:00.133 --> 00:02:03.767
If the thermocline is there,
you've got warm water above

00:02:03.767 --> 00:02:04.900
and cold water below.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.100
And that temperature difference
can be used to

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.500
derive a kind of renewable
energy.

00:02:15.267 --> 00:02:19.133
The moon and the sun, their
gravitational pull on the

00:02:19.133 --> 00:02:22.867
earth, produce tides.

00:02:22.867 --> 00:02:26.300
And that can be tapped
for energy.

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.067
Everything else comes
from down within the

00:02:29.067 --> 00:02:31.800
interior of the earth.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:37.067
Oil and gas in the ocean bottom
comes mostly from algae

00:02:37.067 --> 00:02:41.200
that grew, or phytoplankton
that grew in the ocean

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.900
millions of years ago and then
fell to the bottom and got

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.133
covered over.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:53.900
Coal, oil, and natural gas on
the continents came from

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.467
ancient biomass that
got covered over.

00:03:00.267 --> 00:03:03.867
Geothermal comes from the fact
that the interior of

00:03:03.867 --> 00:03:06.567
the earth is hot.

00:03:06.567 --> 00:03:10.400
And sometimes those hot rocks or
hot lava can come up pretty

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.133
close to the surface.

00:03:12.133 --> 00:03:15.533
And then that temperature
gradient can be used for

00:03:15.533 --> 00:03:16.600
renewable energy.

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:22.433
There is also uranium in the
crust. In fact, some of this

00:03:22.433 --> 00:03:26.433
geothermal heat comes from the
natural decay of uranium.

00:03:26.433 --> 00:03:29.600
But we can also dig up that
uranium and use it in a

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.533
nuclear power plant.

00:03:33.533 --> 00:03:34.967
What have I left out?

00:03:34.967 --> 00:03:37.833
Is there anything, any
renewables you can think of

00:03:37.833 --> 00:03:40.533
that I don't have on there,
or any form of energy not

00:03:40.533 --> 00:03:41.767
included there?

00:03:45.667 --> 00:03:47.600
OK, let's start to go
through this then.

00:03:52.233 --> 00:03:56.400
So first of all, we have to
remind ourselves about units.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.900
You guys are good at this by
now, so I won't spend much

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:59.500
time on it.

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:06.400
But the SI system of unit
of energy is the Joule.

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.400
The unit of powers
is the watt.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:17.033
Energy is power times the time
over which you are using it.

00:04:17.033 --> 00:04:21.333
So a watt second is a Joule.

00:04:21.333 --> 00:04:25.900
And inversely, power is
energy per unit time.

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.133
So a Joule per second
is a watt.

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:35.100
However, when we're talking
about electricity, there is a

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:40.600
non-SI unit that is
quite standard.

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.400
And that's the kilowatt hour.

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:47.500
So the watt is an SI
system of unit.

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:51.167
And we're used to putting
a prefix on it

00:04:51.167 --> 00:04:52.367
kilo meeting 1,000.

00:04:52.367 --> 00:04:55.600
But then the time unit is an
hour instead of a second.

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:00.767
So that kind of messes up the
SI system a little bit.

00:05:00.767 --> 00:05:04.667
But it's easy to go back and
forth, because as you know,

00:05:04.667 --> 00:05:11.967
there are 3,600 seconds in
an hour, 60 times 60.

00:05:11.967 --> 00:05:18.300
And therefore, one kilowatt
hour is 3.6 megaJoules.

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.700
And you don't have
to memorize that.

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:24.000
Just remember how many seconds
there are in an hour.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.433
You can just work that out, that
correspondence, anytime

00:05:28.433 --> 00:05:30.900
you need it.

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:35.900
But it's odd, because
it's an energy unit.

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:40.367
It has a power times a time.

00:05:40.367 --> 00:05:43.100
So it's a little like this,
except we end up not with

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:46.267
Joules, but kilowatt hours.

00:05:46.267 --> 00:05:48.733
And if you're an economist and
you want to have something to

00:05:48.733 --> 00:05:53.167
remember about this unit
kilowatt hour, well, it's

00:05:53.167 --> 00:05:55.900
about $0.10 per kilowatt
hour when I pay my

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:58.933
electric bill at home.

00:05:58.933 --> 00:06:02.067
It varies by a factor of two
or three across the country

00:06:02.067 --> 00:06:05.767
however, so that's not
a fixed value.

00:06:05.767 --> 00:06:07.000
Any questions there?

00:06:09.567 --> 00:06:14.767
Now, it is convenient to break
up our use of energy into

00:06:14.767 --> 00:06:18.500
three general categories.

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:22.667
I think you'll appreciate this
as we go through the material.

00:06:22.667 --> 00:06:25.100
Although it seems a little bit
odd in the beginning to break

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:26.867
it up in this particular way.

00:06:26.867 --> 00:06:29.700
We use energy for heating,
heating your home, for

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:32.833
example, just to raise
the temperature.

00:06:32.833 --> 00:06:36.900
It's a very kind of low-tech
way of using energy.

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:41.167
In fact, it's the lowest form
of energy when you're just

00:06:41.167 --> 00:06:44.100
using heat to raise the
temperature of something.

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:48.667
Transportation, moving
goods or people.

00:06:48.667 --> 00:06:53.533
You can use gas in your car
for that, or diesel fuel.

00:06:53.533 --> 00:07:00.367
And then electricity, which
is a very broad category.

00:07:00.367 --> 00:07:06.467
It includes electric motors,
lighting, electronics.

00:07:06.467 --> 00:07:09.400
But you can also use electronics
for heating and

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:11.400
for transportation.

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:14.800
So electricity is a very
broad category.

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:18.333
But it's a much higher form of
energy in a sense that I'll be

00:07:18.333 --> 00:07:24.167
describing later than just
raising the temperature by

00:07:24.167 --> 00:07:26.500
adding heat.

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:30.800
So we'll see how well that
three-part categorization

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:32.867
works for us as we go through.

00:07:32.867 --> 00:07:36.300
And then, of course, there's
all these energy resources.

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:39.567
These are the ones that I put
on the cartoon over there.

00:07:39.567 --> 00:07:42.367
I'll just run over them briefly
here and make a few

00:07:42.367 --> 00:07:44.267
additional comments.

00:07:44.267 --> 00:07:47.500
And we'll be going through most
of these in some detail

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:49.600
today and tomorrow.

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:50.600
Coal.

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:52.633
There's lots of it.

00:07:52.633 --> 00:07:56.600
It is rather heavily polluting,
puts a lot of CO2

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:59.533
in the atmosphere
by burning coal,

00:07:59.533 --> 00:08:02.500
oxidizing it to form CO2.

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:04.367
Oil and natural gas.

00:08:04.367 --> 00:08:07.367
There's less of it than coal.

00:08:07.367 --> 00:08:10.633
It's less polluting, both
in terms of local air

00:08:10.633 --> 00:08:17.367
pollution--that is to say, less
sulfur, less mercury,

00:08:17.367 --> 00:08:27.567
generally less ash also, it's
at about 20% less CO2

00:08:27.567 --> 00:08:33.200
emissions per Joule of
energy than is coal.

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:39.600
So it's better in almost every
respect than coal, except

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:40.667
there's less of it.

00:08:40.667 --> 00:08:46.467
Nuclear plentiful, mostly
non-polluting.

00:08:46.467 --> 00:08:49.600
Certainly, it puts no CO2
in the atmosphere.

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:53.833
Waste storage is a problem, and
public resistance because

00:08:53.833 --> 00:09:00.133
of a danger factor with
nuclear plants.

00:09:00.133 --> 00:09:05.700
Hydroelectric falls into
the renewable category.

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:09.433
Clean, it's limited, and you
lose natural rivers and

00:09:09.433 --> 00:09:15.033
ecosystems when you dam up large
valley systems. There is

00:09:15.033 --> 00:09:19.000
a technology, though, called
run-of-the-river

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.033
hydroelectric, where
you don't dam it.

00:09:22.033 --> 00:09:27.367
You just take the flow that's
there on any particular day to

00:09:27.367 --> 00:09:29.133
put through your hydroelectric
plant.

00:09:29.133 --> 00:09:32.667
That avoids the big dam, the
big reservoir, and avoids a

00:09:32.667 --> 00:09:36.467
lot of the loss of natural
rivers and ecosystems. So you

00:09:36.467 --> 00:09:41.267
can do hydroelectric
without damming up.

00:09:41.267 --> 00:09:43.867
But it's not usually done.

00:09:43.867 --> 00:09:47.633
Wind is renewable, moderate
cost. A lot of people don't

00:09:47.633 --> 00:09:51.367
like to look at windmills.

00:09:51.367 --> 00:09:53.367
So there's public resistance
to it.

00:09:53.367 --> 00:09:56.367
Also, sometimes there
can be noise and

00:09:56.367 --> 00:10:01.167
issues about bird kill.

00:10:01.167 --> 00:10:05.667
Solar renewable, high cost.
Also, some people don't like

00:10:05.667 --> 00:10:10.567
to see the landscape covered
with solar panels.

00:10:10.567 --> 00:10:13.200
Ocean waves and tides haven't
made very much progress.

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:13.833
It's renewable.

00:10:13.833 --> 00:10:17.600
It's very high cost to build
something that's going to sit

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:21.133
in the ocean and move around
and draw energy from

00:10:21.133 --> 00:10:22.000
the waves and tides.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.700
The engineering really
isn't there yet.

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:26.333
And biomass.

00:10:26.333 --> 00:10:32.467
Renewable, polluting if you
burn it, but no net CO2

00:10:32.467 --> 00:10:35.700
because you're drawing in CO2
from the atmosphere to make

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:37.800
the biomass.

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:40.400
And then when you burn it,
you put the CO2 back.

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:43.767
If you're only putting the CO2
back, it wouldn't be too bad.

00:10:43.767 --> 00:10:51.433
But you're also putting in ash,
probably some mercury,

00:10:51.433 --> 00:10:56.667
other things along with that
burning of the biomass.

00:10:56.667 --> 00:10:58.800
Any questions there?

00:10:58.800 --> 00:10:59.100
All right.

00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:00.967
So that's our starting point.

00:11:00.967 --> 00:11:03.333
Now, this diagram takes a
bit of getting used to.

00:11:06.833 --> 00:11:07.867
It'll be in the, of course,
in the lecture

00:11:07.867 --> 00:11:09.400
you'll have on the server.

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:11.700
But I'll go through it.

00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:14.867
It's from the year 2006.

00:11:14.867 --> 00:11:18.700
And it's US per capita energy.

00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:21.633
And the units are in watts.

00:11:21.633 --> 00:11:24.967
So it's the rate at which
we're using energy for a

00:11:24.967 --> 00:11:27.667
variety of different purposes.

00:11:27.667 --> 00:11:29.700
And I'll run through some of
it, but I won't go through

00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:30.367
every detail.

00:11:30.367 --> 00:11:37.733
So here's oil, biomass,
coal, natural gas.

00:11:37.733 --> 00:11:42.033
Obviously, oil, coal, and
natural gas are the bigger

00:11:42.033 --> 00:11:43.900
inputs here.

00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:47.167
There's geothermal, wind, hydro,
nuclear, and solar up

00:11:47.167 --> 00:11:49.400
at the top as well.

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:52.433
Now, they've got a separate
branch at the top for

00:11:52.433 --> 00:11:55.100
electricity production.

00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:58.200
Everything that's going to
be used by first making

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:03.933
electricity goes up to
this top area here.

00:12:03.933 --> 00:12:08.500
And we see that a little bit of
oil is used for that, but a

00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:09.767
lot of coal.

00:12:09.767 --> 00:12:13.767
In fact, almost all the coal
that's used in this country is

00:12:13.767 --> 00:12:15.000
used for making electricity.

00:12:17.633 --> 00:12:22.967
A lot of natural gas, some
geothermal, wind, hydro.

00:12:22.967 --> 00:12:26.133
All the hydro is used
for electricity.

00:12:26.133 --> 00:12:28.833
All the nuclear is used
for electricity.

00:12:28.833 --> 00:12:31.767
All the solar is used
for electricity.

00:12:31.767 --> 00:12:40.300
Of the 4,400 watts per capita
that's used for electricity

00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:48.833
production, 3,000 is lost as
waste, energy waste, usually

00:12:48.833 --> 00:12:51.867
in the form of heat.

00:12:51.867 --> 00:12:57.333
And about 1,400 is used for
residential, commercial,

00:12:57.333 --> 00:13:01.967
industrial, and even a tiny
bit for transportation.

00:13:01.967 --> 00:13:03.867
So you see how the
diagram works.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.833
And then over at the right-hand
side, it has

00:13:08.833 --> 00:13:12.800
brought together all the waste
from the different energy

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:16.733
streams and put them up here,
and then brought together all

00:13:16.733 --> 00:13:20.133
the useful energy and
has categorized

00:13:20.133 --> 00:13:21.500
them here in the green.

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:27.033
So you can read this by sources,
by use, and by this

00:13:27.033 --> 00:13:34.000
last category of waste
or useful work.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.667
Questions there?

00:13:35.667 --> 00:13:36.667
Yeah?

00:13:36.667 --> 00:13:40.567
STUDENT: Is the wasted energy
wasted in the process of

00:13:40.567 --> 00:13:43.667
getting the energy, or is it
wasted like when you leave a

00:13:43.667 --> 00:13:46.933
light on in a room, and
you're not there?

00:13:46.933 --> 00:13:52.600
PROFESSOR: Mostly, I think this
diagram is meant to

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:54.933
include all of that.

00:13:54.933 --> 00:13:57.967
For example, it includes
transmission loss.

00:13:57.967 --> 00:14:00.333
If you have a power plant
where you're making

00:14:00.333 --> 00:14:02.967
electricity, and then you have
to send it over power lines to

00:14:02.967 --> 00:14:04.667
get it to the consumer,
there's going

00:14:04.667 --> 00:14:06.867
to be loss in that.

00:14:06.867 --> 00:14:09.833
And then there's going to be
some--if you've got a motor

00:14:09.833 --> 00:14:13.000
running, but some of that energy
goes into heat instead

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.567
of turning the shaft of the
motor, that would be lost. But

00:14:17.567 --> 00:14:20.900
I think it would also include
your category, which is lost

00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:24.167
in the generation of
the electricity.

00:14:24.167 --> 00:14:25.567
Yeah, good point.

00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:31.367
So we'll be going back
to look at this

00:14:31.367 --> 00:14:34.267
dominance in fossil fuels.

00:14:34.267 --> 00:14:36.200
We can see it here.

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:42.033
But we'll look at it again in
other ways in just a moment.

00:14:42.033 --> 00:14:47.700
So electricity consumption per
capita, remember this was USA.

00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:55.667
To put that in a somewhat
broader context, let's look at

00:14:55.667 --> 00:14:59.167
that quantity for various
countries.

00:14:59.167 --> 00:15:02.933
So this is per capita
consumption

00:15:02.933 --> 00:15:05.833
of electrical energy.

00:15:05.833 --> 00:15:07.700
And United States is here.

00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:09.967
I've put the arrow
there to show it.

00:15:09.967 --> 00:15:16.467
It's about 1,300 or 1,400
watts well, no, this is

00:15:16.467 --> 00:15:21.200
kilowatt hours, sorry kilowatt
hours of energy

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:24.700
used per year, yearly.

00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:28.433
And we are a high user.

00:15:28.433 --> 00:15:30.933
But there are higher users.

00:15:33.633 --> 00:15:36.567
Why would Iceland, Norway,
Finland, and Canada

00:15:36.567 --> 00:15:38.933
use more than we?

00:15:38.933 --> 00:15:40.800
STUDENT: Heating?

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:43.633
PROFESSOR: Sorry?

00:15:43.633 --> 00:15:44.600
STUDENT: Electric heating?

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:46.467
PROFESSOR: Electric heat, yes.

00:15:46.467 --> 00:15:48.000
They do a lot of electrical
heating.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.333
First of all, they've got a lot
of electricity from hydro

00:15:52.333 --> 00:15:54.000
in those countries.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.600
So the electricity cost
is pretty low.

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:01.167
Generally, heating with
electricity's kind of a waste

00:16:01.167 --> 00:16:03.067
of a high form of energy.

00:16:03.067 --> 00:16:07.567
But in those countries where you
have a lot of electricity,

00:16:07.567 --> 00:16:08.967
you can heat your
house with it.

00:16:08.967 --> 00:16:10.200
And they do.

00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:13.600
And that gives them a very
high per capita use of

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:14.233
electricity.

00:16:14.233 --> 00:16:16.467
Now, we heat our homes, too.

00:16:16.467 --> 00:16:21.100
But we do it more from natural
gas, from oil.

00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:23.867
And so the heating we
do would show up

00:16:23.867 --> 00:16:24.767
in a different category.

00:16:24.767 --> 00:16:29.933
It wouldn't show up in the
electricity consumption.

00:16:29.933 --> 00:16:33.600
And compared to other countries,
however, we are

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:36.700
pretty high in our
electricity use.

00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:39.567
Questions on that?

00:16:39.567 --> 00:16:41.867
And of course, these things have
been growing over time.

00:16:41.867 --> 00:16:46.267
So we've got a green band, a
red band, and a brown band

00:16:46.267 --> 00:16:52.300
renewables, nuclear, and
fossil since 1980.

00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:57.300
And this is annual electricity
generation worldwide.

00:16:57.300 --> 00:16:59.767
It's not per capita.

00:16:59.767 --> 00:17:01.167
So the unit is large.

00:17:01.167 --> 00:17:05.933
It's a terawatt hour per year.

00:17:05.933 --> 00:17:09.567
A terawatt hour per year.

00:17:09.567 --> 00:17:14.033
Remember, it goes kilo-,
mega-, giga-, tera-,

00:17:14.033 --> 00:17:16.267
in powers of three.

00:17:16.267 --> 00:17:18.300
Terawatt hour.

00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:23.300
So nuclear has grown.

00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:30.167
But is steady the last 15, 20
years, renewable here is

00:17:30.167 --> 00:17:32.600
almost all hydro.

00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:35.700
Almost all the other renewables
we'll be talking

00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:40.533
about in this course, at the
moment, are pretty tiny.

00:17:40.533 --> 00:17:43.100
And so the only one that really
shows up on a graph

00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:46.933
like this is hydroelectricity.

00:17:46.933 --> 00:17:51.733
And then the fossil fuel has
been growing, unfortunately.

00:17:51.733 --> 00:17:55.833
And that's the big
CO2 producer.

00:18:01.567 --> 00:18:05.533
So I'll stick--let's start with
coal and see where that

00:18:05.533 --> 00:18:07.267
is and how we use it.

00:18:07.267 --> 00:18:09.267
There are the global
coal deposits.

00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:14.500
I'll keep my comments to the
northern hemisphere.

00:18:17.133 --> 00:18:19.433
China has quite a lot.

00:18:19.433 --> 00:18:23.467
Russia has the largest
of any country.

00:18:23.467 --> 00:18:24.533
Europe has quite a bit.

00:18:24.533 --> 00:18:28.800
And the United States has
quite a bit of coal.

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:33.767
Zooming into the US, you see
that there are coal beds along

00:18:33.767 --> 00:18:38.200
the Appalachian Mountains, some
in the Midwest, and some

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:42.900
in the Rocky Mountain West.
They've sub-categorized it

00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:47.033
here in terms of different
quality of coal.

00:18:47.033 --> 00:18:48.400
But I'm not going to
go through that.

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:50.233
I'm just going to show
you generally

00:18:50.233 --> 00:18:52.400
where the coal is located.

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:55.800
So if you want to generate
energy and you live in this

00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:59.733
part of the world, you're
probably going to find coal is

00:18:59.733 --> 00:19:01.033
the cheap way to do it.

00:19:03.767 --> 00:19:07.633
But maybe if you're over here,
you'll find a different method

00:19:07.633 --> 00:19:12.100
because you're pretty far
from the coal beds.

00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:13.167
How do you use coal?

00:19:13.167 --> 00:19:13.900
It's very simple.

00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:19.300
You burn it, you generate
steam, you put the steam

00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:21.667
through a rotating turbine.

00:19:21.667 --> 00:19:24.867
The rotating turbine's hooked
up to a generator.

00:19:24.867 --> 00:19:27.200
The generator makes
electricity.

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:31.167
You've got to cool that water
off on the downside of the

00:19:31.167 --> 00:19:33.967
turbine, so it doesn't
give back pressure.

00:19:33.967 --> 00:19:37.567
And putting gas back in the
wrong direction, you've got to

00:19:37.567 --> 00:19:40.000
have cooling as well.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:40.967
Very simple idea.

00:19:40.967 --> 00:19:44.567
You just make steam and put
it through a turbine.

00:19:44.567 --> 00:19:49.467
However, when you burn, of
course, you're going to

00:19:49.467 --> 00:19:50.900
generated--you're oxidizing
carbon.

00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:53.233
You're going to generate CO2.

00:19:53.233 --> 00:19:55.167
There's some sulfur
in the coal.

00:19:55.167 --> 00:19:57.433
You're going to generate SO2.

00:19:57.433 --> 00:19:58.400
There's some mercury.

00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:03.067
You're going to generate
HGO and NOX.

00:20:03.067 --> 00:20:03.933
Where does that come from?

00:20:03.933 --> 00:20:06.300
Well, remember, you're
burning this coal in

00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:08.600
the presence of air.

00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:11.667
Air has N2 and O2.

00:20:11.667 --> 00:20:16.100
If your flame is hot enough,
you'll dissociate N2 and

00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:21.267
dissociate O2, and they'll
recombine NO.

00:20:21.267 --> 00:20:22.367
And then you've got
a pollutant.

00:20:22.367 --> 00:20:26.567
So these are coming
from the fuel.

00:20:26.567 --> 00:20:29.900
The carbon was in the fuel, the
sulfur was in the fuel,

00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:31.200
the mercury was in the fuel.

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:33.167
This is not coming
from the fuel.

00:20:33.167 --> 00:20:36.733
This is coming from air
that you're using

00:20:36.733 --> 00:20:39.833
to oxidize the coal.

00:20:39.833 --> 00:20:43.900
You're basically dissociating
air and forming NOX.

00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:47.500
And then the particles are
coming off the smoke.

00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:53.100
Remember that, because some
other ways for generating heat

00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:56.167
will generate NOX even if
there's no pollutant in the

00:20:56.167 --> 00:20:57.400
fuel itself.

00:20:59.533 --> 00:21:03.100
So when you see a power plant
like this, those are the

00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:04.067
smokestacks.

00:21:04.067 --> 00:21:08.200
That's where the combustion
products

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:09.467
are going to be leaving.

00:21:09.467 --> 00:21:12.867
And that's the cooling tower,
where you're cooling that

00:21:12.867 --> 00:21:16.867
steam on the backside
of the turbine.

00:21:16.867 --> 00:21:18.900
So that is not smoke.

00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:21.933
That's just water vapor
condensing to

00:21:21.933 --> 00:21:23.867
form a cloud there.

00:21:23.867 --> 00:21:27.067
And they have enough scrubbers
on the stack that you're not

00:21:27.067 --> 00:21:29.000
seeing much of a smoke plume.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:33.133
But there is some coming off
of the smokestacks there.

00:21:33.133 --> 00:21:36.400
So know what you're looking
at when you see this.

00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:39.633
You know what you're
looking at here.

00:21:39.633 --> 00:21:46.300
Long trains full with boxcars
with coal transport the coal

00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:49.767
from the mines to
the power plant.

00:21:49.767 --> 00:21:52.700
And you see the big piles
of coal ready to be

00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:57.067
put into the burners.

00:21:57.067 --> 00:22:00.367
Now, there's this useful
quantity called the emission

00:22:00.367 --> 00:22:04.767
coefficient, which is how much
CO2 do you put in the

00:22:04.767 --> 00:22:09.900
atmosphere for every Joule
of energy that you create

00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:12.367
electricity.

00:22:12.367 --> 00:22:20.100
And so the units here are CO2
emission coefficient in units

00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:23.867
of kilograms per gigaJoule.

00:22:23.867 --> 00:22:27.567
Kilograms of carbon dioxide per
gigajoule of electrical

00:22:27.567 --> 00:22:29.633
energy produced.

00:22:29.633 --> 00:22:32.667
And different types of
fuel is given here.

00:22:32.667 --> 00:22:35.533
The coals are generally
in this region.

00:22:35.533 --> 00:22:44.133
And they are high, generally,
about 95 kilograms of carbon

00:22:44.133 --> 00:22:48.267
dioxide for every gigaJoule
that is produced.

00:22:48.267 --> 00:22:54.133
The oils, burning fuel oil,
is about 20% lower.

00:22:54.133 --> 00:22:59.000
And some of the natural gases
are even 20% lower than that.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.267
So they're still putting CO2
in the atmosphere, but at a

00:23:02.267 --> 00:23:06.967
rate that's maybe 30 or 40%
less than coal does.

00:23:06.967 --> 00:23:12.100
So coal, in this measure, is the
worst. And of course, in

00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:15.500
the local air pollution,
it's also the worst of

00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:16.733
all of these options.

00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:22.467
And what is the future
of coal?

00:23:22.467 --> 00:23:29.667
So here's a timeline, 1950 up
to 2100, 90 years from now.

00:23:29.667 --> 00:23:34.700
The units are megatons
of coal.

00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:37.467
And it's broken down by
different parts of the

00:23:37.467 --> 00:23:43.667
economic world, North America,
Europe, the Pacific countries,

00:23:43.667 --> 00:23:48.833
China, South Asian countries,
and the former Soviet Union.

00:23:48.833 --> 00:23:50.633
Look at some of these
characteristics.

00:23:50.633 --> 00:23:58.533
So North America has peaked
and is going to be flat

00:23:58.533 --> 00:23:59.800
according to these
projections.

00:24:02.267 --> 00:24:07.167
Europe peaked long ago and is
now down to a fraction of what

00:24:07.167 --> 00:24:11.067
it was using 30 or
40 years ago.

00:24:11.067 --> 00:24:14.900
China is rapidly increasing
at the moment.

00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:15.967
Of course, these are
projections.

00:24:15.967 --> 00:24:17.533
We don't know exactly what
they're going to do.

00:24:17.533 --> 00:24:25.367
But it looks like they're going
to dominate coal use.

00:24:25.367 --> 00:24:26.800
They do already.

00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:28.900
It looks like they will
continue to do that

00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:30.400
for 20 or 30 years.

00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:34.467
And then they'll probably
run out of coal.

00:24:34.467 --> 00:24:36.767
The former Soviet Union, which
remember that big blob up in

00:24:36.767 --> 00:24:38.600
the right-hand side of
that earlier diagram?

00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:45.767
We're talking about that.

00:24:45.767 --> 00:24:49.500
And they're not using
much of it yet.

00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:51.733
But that's probably
all of this.

00:24:51.733 --> 00:24:56.767
So 50, 60 years from now, they
will probably be the dominant

00:24:56.767 --> 00:24:59.833
user of coal.

00:24:59.833 --> 00:25:01.233
Any questions on that?

00:25:01.233 --> 00:25:01.733
Yeah?

00:25:01.733 --> 00:25:05.067
STUDENT: So the decrease over
time for all of these regions,

00:25:05.067 --> 00:25:09.033
is that because of a change in
energy use, or is it because

00:25:09.033 --> 00:25:10.500
they've run out of coal?

00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:12.333
PROFESSOR: I think it's mostly

00:25:12.333 --> 00:25:14.233
running out of coal.

00:25:14.233 --> 00:25:16.500
I don't think these projections
that are put

00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:21.467
forward put much stock in the
fact that we're going to

00:25:21.467 --> 00:25:23.667
purposely leave that stuff
in the ground.

00:25:23.667 --> 00:25:24.933
Yeah.

00:25:29.933 --> 00:25:33.467
There's this term you hear on
television all the time "clean

00:25:33.467 --> 00:25:35.733
coal." I can't tell you how
many times I've seen this

00:25:35.733 --> 00:25:36.667
commercial.

00:25:36.667 --> 00:25:38.533
Maybe I listen to the wrong
channels or something.

00:25:38.533 --> 00:25:41.400
But "clean coal" is a marketing
term used to

00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:45.467
indicate coal burning without
local air pollution.

00:25:45.467 --> 00:25:49.000
And to some extent, that is
feasible today with the

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:52.500
appropriate scrubbers on the
smokestacks, but also with

00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:54.833
carbon capture and
sequestration.

00:25:54.833 --> 00:26:00.500
The term "clean coal" usually
infers both of these.

00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:05.000
But this second technology
is not developed yet.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.667
So it's talking about
something really

00:26:07.667 --> 00:26:10.200
far into the future.

00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:15.000
So there is no such thing as
"clean coal" if, by that term,

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:19.667
they mean both of these
characteristics.

00:26:23.067 --> 00:26:25.233
So watch out for this term
"clean coal." It's a little

00:26:25.233 --> 00:26:30.367
bit of a figment of the ad
agency's imagination.

00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:36.067
So then we'll talk briefly
about oil.

00:26:36.067 --> 00:26:36.933
Where is the oil?

00:26:36.933 --> 00:26:39.367
Well, I hope you can read
that in the back.

00:26:39.367 --> 00:26:42.367
But most of it's in the Middle
East Saudi Arabia, Kuwait,

00:26:42.367 --> 00:26:47.433
Iran, Iraq, and the Emirates.

00:26:47.433 --> 00:26:49.667
And so that's just what
we know about from the

00:26:49.667 --> 00:26:50.500
newspapers, right?

00:26:50.500 --> 00:26:54.500
That's the cause of all
of our headaches.

00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:57.400
The oil comes from the Middle
East. But there is quite a bit

00:26:57.400 --> 00:27:00.767
in the USSR, Venezuela.

00:27:00.767 --> 00:27:04.833
The United States doesn't
have much left.

00:27:04.833 --> 00:27:06.833
A few other countries have it.

00:27:06.833 --> 00:27:10.933
This is as of this moment.

00:27:10.933 --> 00:27:13.600
And what does it look like
into the future?

00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:19.567
This goes to 2050 and starts
in the year 1930.

00:27:19.567 --> 00:27:22.367
And it's in units--strange
units, billions

00:27:22.367 --> 00:27:24.867
of barrels per year.

00:27:24.867 --> 00:27:35.133
GB/A, gigabarrels per annum,
is the unit on that thing.

00:27:35.133 --> 00:27:40.867
And this brings us to this
concept called "peak oil." The

00:27:40.867 --> 00:27:44.733
concept of peak oil is that oil
use will, at some point,

00:27:44.733 --> 00:27:49.967
reach a maximum and then begin
to decrease slowly.

00:27:49.967 --> 00:27:53.833
And it'll do that--it'll peak
at different times in

00:27:53.833 --> 00:27:56.300
different countries for
different reservoirs.

00:27:56.300 --> 00:28:01.700
For example, the US has probably
passed its peak oil.

00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:08.633
It probably did it 10
or 20 years ago.

00:28:08.633 --> 00:28:11.500
Other countries, for example,
the Middle East, won't reach

00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:14.233
their peak oil or maybe they're
just about reaching it

00:28:14.233 --> 00:28:16.100
these are all projections,
though, so

00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:17.100
they can't be trusted.

00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:22.433
But eventually, they will all
taper off because you're using

00:28:22.433 --> 00:28:25.800
up the resource not because
you've decided to keep it in

00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:28.400
the ground, but because you're
using up the resource.

00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:33.267
So by the time we get to 2050,
we'll be already halfway down

00:28:33.267 --> 00:28:33.833
from the peak.

00:28:33.833 --> 00:28:37.867
And of course, the price at that
point will be climbing

00:28:37.867 --> 00:28:41.533
even much more steeply
than we see today.

00:28:41.533 --> 00:28:44.300
Remember, the coal curves
went further than that.

00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:50.800
That plot went out to 2100, of
course, just in the former

00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:52.067
Soviet Union.

00:28:56.233 --> 00:29:00.700
You should know that New
Haven is a big oil

00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:02.467
port for New England.

00:29:02.467 --> 00:29:05.867
Here's a Google picture of
the port in New Haven.

00:29:05.867 --> 00:29:09.367
And all these white circles
here, of course and there are

00:29:09.367 --> 00:29:13.233
dozens of them are oil tanks.

00:29:13.233 --> 00:29:15.900
So when you drive across the Q
Bridge and look around, you'll

00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:17.967
see these things all
over the place.

00:29:17.967 --> 00:29:21.867
And of course, that's because
the oil tankers come in there,

00:29:21.867 --> 00:29:25.233
off-load their oil into these
tanks, and then they are

00:29:25.233 --> 00:29:29.333
transported by truck to the rest
of New England, used for

00:29:29.333 --> 00:29:30.767
a variety of purposes.

00:29:30.767 --> 00:29:36.267
Some of it's gasoline, some
of it's crude oil.

00:29:36.267 --> 00:29:41.267
Among other uses is that it's
used to drive the Harbor power

00:29:41.267 --> 00:29:47.900
plant, which is here, I guess,
which gives us most of our

00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:51.267
electricity in New Haven.

00:29:51.267 --> 00:29:53.433
There's the power plant.

00:29:53.433 --> 00:29:57.200
It's called the Harbor
Generating Station.

00:29:57.200 --> 00:30:03.300
Last year, it emitted almost
600,000 tons of CO2 into the

00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:08.633
atmosphere, while producing
about 600,000 megawatt hours

00:30:08.633 --> 00:30:10.600
of electrical energy.

00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:14.100
Yale produces a little
bit of its own.

00:30:14.100 --> 00:30:18.600
But this is the main generator
plant for New Haven.

00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:22.200
This information and a lot more
comes from a nice website

00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:27.833
called carma.org that tracks
fossil fuel burning plants

00:30:27.833 --> 00:30:29.533
around the world.

00:30:29.533 --> 00:30:32.567
And you can get information on
how much they burn, how much

00:30:32.567 --> 00:30:35.733
CO2 they put in the atmosphere,
and so on, from

00:30:35.733 --> 00:30:37.167
that interesting website,
carma.org.

00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:43.133
Questions here?

00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:51.933
Natural gas has suddenly
become very important.

00:30:51.933 --> 00:30:56.900
These are the areas where we are
currently getting natural

00:30:56.900 --> 00:31:02.000
gas or we'll soon be getting
large amounts of natural gas.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:07.500
And they use this curious word
"play" in the natural gas

00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:12.267
industry to indicate an area
targeted for gas development.

00:31:12.267 --> 00:31:14.367
So if you run across that
word, don't be confused.

00:31:14.367 --> 00:31:20.067
It has that particular term
in that field of study.

00:31:20.067 --> 00:31:25.700
And it's a very exciting field
right now, because they've

00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:27.067
learned how to get--suddenly
they've learned how to get

00:31:27.067 --> 00:31:31.167
natural gas out of
shale, using this

00:31:31.167 --> 00:31:32.400
method called fracting.

00:31:34.867 --> 00:31:37.467
So when you look at the
timeline, this is similar to

00:31:37.467 --> 00:31:45.600
the ones I've shown you for coal
and oil, except it's for

00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:48.967
natural gas and just
for the US.

00:31:48.967 --> 00:31:54.333
And the timeline is a shorter
one, 1990 to 2035.

00:31:54.333 --> 00:31:58.300
They've got these various
categories tight gas, onshore

00:31:58.300 --> 00:32:01.733
conventional, offshore,
coal bed methane.

00:32:01.733 --> 00:32:04.067
But look at this new
one, shale gas.

00:32:04.067 --> 00:32:05.133
It was almost nothing.

00:32:05.133 --> 00:32:08.533
And then just a couple years
ago, they discovered this

00:32:08.533 --> 00:32:12.167
method for getting natural
gas out of shales.

00:32:12.167 --> 00:32:14.967
And suddenly, that's become
the biggest one.

00:32:14.967 --> 00:32:16.567
And it's growing.

00:32:16.567 --> 00:32:19.300
So this is a big surprise.

00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:23.467
It humbles us in terms of our
ability to predict the future

00:32:23.467 --> 00:32:26.333
of energy resources, because we
didn't see this one coming.

00:32:26.333 --> 00:32:30.000
And temporarily, this is going
to really shake the markets

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:34.733
and is shaking the markets,
and is, to some extent,

00:32:34.733 --> 00:32:39.867
slowing down the development
of renewables, because now

00:32:39.867 --> 00:32:45.300
we've got a cheap new source of
natural gas, which, as they

00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:48.333
say, is cleaner than coal.

00:32:48.333 --> 00:32:53.400
However, it's still a fossil
fuel, still putting CO2 in the

00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:55.000
atmosphere.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:56.267
Questions on this?

00:32:59.633 --> 00:33:03.000
OK, we'll move on to nuclear.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.300
That's what a typical nuclear
plant looks like.

00:33:05.300 --> 00:33:06.467
These are cooling towers.

00:33:06.467 --> 00:33:09.733
You don't see any smokestacks.

00:33:09.733 --> 00:33:11.100
You're not burning anything.

00:33:15.267 --> 00:33:17.700
You've got the reactor core.

00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:19.833
You produce steam from that.

00:33:19.833 --> 00:33:21.733
And the rest you know.

00:33:21.733 --> 00:33:24.533
Once you get the steam, you
put it through a turbine,

00:33:24.533 --> 00:33:27.300
turbine runs a generator
to make electricity.

00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:31.833
You've got to cool down the back
side with cooling water.

00:33:31.833 --> 00:33:33.667
That's what the cooling
tower is for.

00:33:33.667 --> 00:33:35.100
And then you can recycle
the water.

00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:44.867
Now, remember, this is
nuclear fission.

00:33:44.867 --> 00:33:50.400
This is taking large nuclei and
splitting them apart to

00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:52.067
get energy.

00:33:52.067 --> 00:33:56.567
This is a book you'd find, in
an introductory textbook in

00:33:56.567 --> 00:33:57.967
nuclear physics.

00:33:57.967 --> 00:34:01.967
It's the binding energy per
nucleon as the function of the

00:34:01.967 --> 00:34:05.433
mass number of the element that
you're talking about.

00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:13.600
It has a peak roughly where iron
sits, and decreases to

00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:17.000
the right and the
left of that.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:22.133
This means that if you split
apart heavy nuclei, you can

00:34:22.133 --> 00:34:27.233
get energy out, or if you
combine like nuclei, you get

00:34:27.233 --> 00:34:29.467
energy out.

00:34:29.467 --> 00:34:31.933
That's called fusion.

00:34:31.933 --> 00:34:37.967
This is the way the sun makes
its energy, by taking hydrogen

00:34:37.967 --> 00:34:41.833
and hydrogen and
making helium.

00:34:41.833 --> 00:34:44.633
And this is the way we make
energy in a conventional

00:34:44.633 --> 00:34:47.900
nuclear plant, by taking uranium
235 and splitting it

00:34:47.900 --> 00:34:52.767
apart into lighter nuclei and
getting energy out that way.

00:34:56.067 --> 00:35:00.800
We're still working on a way
to do this synthetically.

00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:03.900
That's one of the great unsolved
problems in nuclear

00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:08.067
physics, is how to make a
fusion reactor that'll

00:35:08.067 --> 00:35:10.233
generate electricity for us.

00:35:10.233 --> 00:35:12.933
We've been trying for 50
years, still haven't

00:35:12.933 --> 00:35:13.667
been able to do it.

00:35:13.667 --> 00:35:17.300
So all the nuclear plants we're
talking about here use

00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:21.033
fission to generate
electricity.

00:35:21.033 --> 00:35:22.300
Questions on that?

00:35:25.567 --> 00:35:30.800
These are the countries that do
it, ranked by the percent

00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:33.900
of their total electricity
generation

00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:36.600
that is done by nuclear.

00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:40.933
Lithuania and France lead
the way with 75%.

00:35:40.933 --> 00:35:47.333
The United States is over here
with 22% percent, and so on.

00:35:47.333 --> 00:35:50.133
So we are not a leader
in this by any means.

00:35:50.133 --> 00:35:51.400
But we do some.

00:35:54.167 --> 00:35:56.433
And here's where the
uranium is located.

00:35:56.433 --> 00:36:00.533
The big purple box for each
country just gives you a

00:36:00.533 --> 00:36:05.167
measure of how much uranium is
believed to be stored in the

00:36:05.167 --> 00:36:09.167
earth's crust within the
national borders of each of

00:36:09.167 --> 00:36:10.167
these countries.

00:36:10.167 --> 00:36:11.667
So we have a lot.

00:36:11.667 --> 00:36:13.800
Canada has a lot.

00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:14.933
Kazakhstan has a lot.

00:36:14.933 --> 00:36:16.067
Russia has some.

00:36:16.067 --> 00:36:17.433
Australia has a whole lot.

00:36:20.233 --> 00:36:21.433
What about Connecticut?

00:36:21.433 --> 00:36:23.433
Yes, we get some of ours
from Connecticut.

00:36:23.433 --> 00:36:27.500
There's a nuclear plant in the
southeast corner of the state

00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:30.267
called Millstone 2
and Millstone 3.

00:36:30.267 --> 00:36:35.000
That's what it looks
like from the air.

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:41.367
And it generates about 2,000
megawatts of energy.

00:36:47.267 --> 00:36:52.033
But it has a sad history
in a way.

00:36:52.033 --> 00:36:56.300
The install capacity, in terms
of gigawatts, is given here.

00:36:56.300 --> 00:37:01.500
And the number of reactors is
given here, 100, 200, 300.

00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:05.333
And you see that it grew rapidly
during the '70s.

00:37:05.333 --> 00:37:09.333
But then because of these two
famous incidents Three Mile

00:37:09.333 --> 00:37:15.233
Island in eastern Pennsylvania
and Chernobyl in the Ukraine

00:37:15.233 --> 00:37:17.667
suddenly, people got
spooked about the

00:37:17.667 --> 00:37:19.467
use of nuclear plants.

00:37:19.467 --> 00:37:24.300
And really, nothing much has
been built for the last 20

00:37:24.300 --> 00:37:29.733
years, even 25 years, in terms
of new power plants.

00:37:29.733 --> 00:37:32.267
So that is a large build-out.

00:37:32.267 --> 00:37:35.700
But it's pretty much flat for
the last couple of decades.

00:37:40.267 --> 00:37:42.167
And what to do with
the nuclear waste?

00:37:42.167 --> 00:37:46.133
So I mentioned that there was
a plant--there's a nuclear

00:37:46.133 --> 00:37:49.200
plant in southeast
Connecticut.

00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:51.700
There used to be one up on the
river, up on the Connecticut

00:37:51.700 --> 00:37:53.100
River, in the center
part of the state.

00:37:53.100 --> 00:37:55.233
That's called the Connecticut
Yankee Plant.

00:37:55.233 --> 00:37:58.167
That was shut down about
15 years ago.

00:37:58.167 --> 00:38:01.867
And not only did they have
nowhere to ship the waste, the

00:38:01.867 --> 00:38:05.867
nuclear waste when that plant
was active, but when they

00:38:05.867 --> 00:38:08.300
stopped the plant and
decommissioned it, they still

00:38:08.300 --> 00:38:09.567
had no place to put the waste.

00:38:09.567 --> 00:38:12.033
So it's still sitting there.

00:38:12.033 --> 00:38:15.333
15 years after the plant was
shut down, you still have all

00:38:15.333 --> 00:38:19.200
the nuclear waste below ground
in these big tubes, because we

00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:21.833
don't know yet in this
country how to get

00:38:21.833 --> 00:38:23.667
rid of nuclear waste.

00:38:23.667 --> 00:38:24.933
So that's a real problem.

00:38:27.733 --> 00:38:29.700
Questions on that?

00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:36.300
I think we can get through
hydro then.

00:38:36.300 --> 00:38:39.700
The basic idea is
a simple one.

00:38:39.700 --> 00:38:42.467
For hydroelectric power, as I
said before, you need to get

00:38:42.467 --> 00:38:46.233
the water falling
on high terrain.

00:38:46.233 --> 00:38:50.000
Now, that's likely to happen
anyway, because when the air

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:55.400
comes along and lifts up over
a mountain, you cool the air

00:38:55.400 --> 00:38:58.800
adiabatically, generate clouds
and precipitation.

00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:01.167
So you've got this process
called orographic

00:39:01.167 --> 00:39:03.200
precipitation, mountain-induced

00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:07.400
precipitation, that
automatically gives you a lot

00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:09.867
of rain on high terrain.

00:39:09.867 --> 00:39:11.433
So it's kind of perfect
in a way.

00:39:14.100 --> 00:39:18.933
The potential energy, then,
you've produced is the product

00:39:18.933 --> 00:39:21.800
this is right out of your
physics textbook potential

00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:27.367
energy is the product of mass,
gravity, and height.

00:39:27.367 --> 00:39:28.633
It's simply Mgh.

00:39:31.467 --> 00:39:34.967
And that would have units
of, well, Joules.

00:39:37.967 --> 00:39:40.433
Now, your job is not done.

00:39:40.433 --> 00:39:43.800
You've got to get this into your
hydroelectric plant, get

00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:47.867
it through a turbine, and make
electricity from it.

00:39:47.867 --> 00:39:52.100
But at least the energy is there
from the rain falling on

00:39:52.100 --> 00:39:52.933
high ground.

00:39:52.933 --> 00:39:55.567
And as I mentioned before, it
can be either a dammed up

00:39:55.567 --> 00:39:59.000
lake, or there are these new
run-of-the-river designs,

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:01.733
where you don't have to dam,
you just take the water.

00:40:01.733 --> 00:40:04.333
But then you're subject to
whatever the river flow

00:40:04.333 --> 00:40:06.967
happens to be at the moment.

00:40:06.967 --> 00:40:09.533
You don't have any way
to store and use

00:40:09.533 --> 00:40:13.567
it during dry periods.

00:40:13.567 --> 00:40:16.167
So there's a typical
dam system.

00:40:16.167 --> 00:40:21.300
This is from Hydro-Quebec
up in northern Quebec.

00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:25.633
A large dammed lake goes down
through a power plant,

00:40:25.633 --> 00:40:29.800
generates electricity,
off you go.

00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:31.133
Here are some examples.

00:40:31.133 --> 00:40:34.233
I'll show you some of these
in just a minute.

00:40:34.233 --> 00:40:38.500
The James Bay Project, up in
northern Quebec, generates

00:40:38.500 --> 00:40:44.733
16,000 megawatts when it's
operating at full capacity.

00:40:44.733 --> 00:40:49.733
The famous Grand Coulee Dam,
about 7,000 megawatts.

00:40:49.733 --> 00:40:52.767
These are all the most famous
dams in this country.

00:40:52.767 --> 00:40:54.367
Hoover Dam's 2,000.

00:40:54.367 --> 00:40:56.067
Glen Canyon's 1,300.

00:40:56.067 --> 00:40:58.400
And the Three Gorges dam, the
new one that opened up in

00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:01.900
China about 10 years ago,
is the largest of all.

00:41:01.900 --> 00:41:04.367
That's about 20,000 megawatts.

00:41:04.367 --> 00:41:07.000
Let's take a look at these.

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:10.500
So the James Bay Project
is here.

00:41:10.500 --> 00:41:11.300
Do you know where you are?

00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:13.067
So here's Labrador.

00:41:13.067 --> 00:41:16.433
Connecticut's down
here somewhere.

00:41:16.433 --> 00:41:20.567
And Hudson Bay is here, and
James Bay is there.

00:41:20.567 --> 00:41:24.100
So they dammed up some of these
rivers on their way into

00:41:24.100 --> 00:41:26.300
James Bay and Hudson Bay.

00:41:30.333 --> 00:41:34.133
A word about the seasonality
of hydroelectric.

00:41:34.133 --> 00:41:38.100
And I'll use Hydro-Quebec as an
example in my discussion of

00:41:38.100 --> 00:41:39.733
seasonality.

00:41:39.733 --> 00:41:44.200
As you know from this course,
rainfall normally comes

00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:47.167
heavier in some seasons of
the year than in other

00:41:47.167 --> 00:41:48.033
seasons of the year.

00:41:48.033 --> 00:41:54.900
Well, in Canada, for reasons
we've already touched on, the

00:41:54.900 --> 00:42:00.833
maximum demand is in winter
because of electrical heating.

00:42:00.833 --> 00:42:03.300
And yet, in winter, most of the

00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:06.667
precipitation falls as snow.

00:42:06.667 --> 00:42:09.300
So it doesn't go right
into the rivers.

00:42:09.300 --> 00:42:12.667
So the maximum natural river
flow is in the spring and

00:42:12.667 --> 00:42:16.867
early summer from snow melt.

00:42:16.867 --> 00:42:18.633
So how do you solve
that problem?

00:42:18.633 --> 00:42:20.467
Your demand is in winter.

00:42:20.467 --> 00:42:23.667
Your natural river flow is in
spring and early summer.

00:42:23.667 --> 00:42:26.433
Well, there are two
ways to solve it.

00:42:26.433 --> 00:42:28.067
One is the obvious way.

00:42:28.067 --> 00:42:32.767
The reservoirs can store that
water for six months

00:42:32.767 --> 00:42:35.233
until you need it.

00:42:35.233 --> 00:42:38.767
And the other thing is to sell
it to a place that has a

00:42:38.767 --> 00:42:39.900
different demand curve.

00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:44.333
In other words, they sell a lot
of energy to us down here

00:42:44.333 --> 00:42:48.933
in New England, because a lot
of our maximum demand is in

00:42:48.933 --> 00:42:51.533
summer for air conditioning.

00:42:51.533 --> 00:42:55.567
So using those two methods,
they solve this

00:42:55.567 --> 00:43:00.800
incompatibility between
their demand and their

00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:01.900
natural river flow.

00:43:01.900 --> 00:43:05.467
So as you go around the world,
not only for hydro, but for

00:43:05.467 --> 00:43:08.800
the other renewables, you want
to look at this issue.

00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:10.500
When is the demand?

00:43:10.500 --> 00:43:12.933
When is the source available?

00:43:12.933 --> 00:43:14.967
And find out some way to
solve that problem.

00:43:14.967 --> 00:43:18.567
That applies to almost every
renewable energy source.

00:43:18.567 --> 00:43:22.133
The timing isn't what
you would want.

00:43:22.133 --> 00:43:23.367
Questions on that?

00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:30.600
Another famous one is the
Columbia River and the Snake

00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:33.233
River that feeds into it.

00:43:33.233 --> 00:43:36.000
So here is Washington
and Oregon.

00:43:39.967 --> 00:43:41.633
The biggest--there are a lot
of big dams along there.

00:43:41.633 --> 00:43:47.100
I think the biggest is a Grand
Coulee Dam, which is there.

00:43:47.100 --> 00:43:52.600
And that's the one I gave you
the production numbers for.

00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:54.233
Another big area in this
country is the

00:43:54.233 --> 00:43:57.167
Colorado River system.

00:43:57.167 --> 00:44:01.333
And the two most famous parts
there are the Glen Canyon Dam

00:44:01.333 --> 00:44:05.467
with Lake Powell backed up
behind it and Hoover Dam with

00:44:05.467 --> 00:44:09.267
Lake Mead backed up behind it.

00:44:09.267 --> 00:44:15.067
But on the scale of things,
those are relatively small.

00:44:15.067 --> 00:44:17.933
Those are those numbers there.

00:44:17.933 --> 00:44:21.067
I mean, they look majestic
to see them.

00:44:21.067 --> 00:44:24.600
But they're not as large a some
of the other big, new

00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:26.667
hydroelectric plants we
have around the world.

00:44:30.833 --> 00:44:34.533
And then the Three Gorges Dam
in China, you see it here,

00:44:34.533 --> 00:44:36.233
backed up a huge lake.

00:44:36.233 --> 00:44:41.967
And that has that huge number of
20,000 megawatts of energy

00:44:41.967 --> 00:44:44.567
at full capacity.

00:44:44.567 --> 00:44:45.533
How does it work?

00:44:45.533 --> 00:44:49.367
Well, you've got your reservoir
with a certain

00:44:49.367 --> 00:44:51.300
height of water.

00:44:51.300 --> 00:44:53.800
Hydrostatically, that generates
high pressure at the

00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:58.200
bottom, which pushes water down
through this smooth tube

00:44:58.200 --> 00:45:04.967
called the penstock, smooth to
avoid turbulence and losses.

00:45:04.967 --> 00:45:07.467
And then it goes right
into the turbine.

00:45:07.467 --> 00:45:09.133
And then the rest of
the story you know.

00:45:09.133 --> 00:45:11.633
You turn the turbine, the
turbine turns a generator,

00:45:11.633 --> 00:45:13.267
which makes electricity.

00:45:13.267 --> 00:45:14.267
And off you go.

00:45:14.267 --> 00:45:18.033
And the water then goes
on down the river.

00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:25.800
There's the Grand Coulee Dam.

00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:27.933
And I want to show you this.

00:45:27.933 --> 00:45:31.433
There's a couple of people
standing there for scale.

00:45:31.433 --> 00:45:34.967
There is the turbine, one of
the turbines for the Grand

00:45:34.967 --> 00:45:35.600
Coulee Dam.

00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:40.300
These are really massive
turbines that generate a lot

00:45:40.300 --> 00:45:41.533
of electricity.

00:45:46.300 --> 00:45:49.833
Yeah, so let me just wrap
up with this then.

00:45:49.833 --> 00:45:53.867
I pulled off this data from
the DOE a few years ago,

00:45:53.867 --> 00:45:58.333
comparing three states
Connecticut, Ohio, and Oregon.

00:45:58.333 --> 00:46:04.200
Now, Connecticut, as we've seen,
has some petroleum and

00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:06.467
gas being used to generate
electricity.

00:46:06.467 --> 00:46:08.333
But it also has a big
nuclear component.

00:46:08.333 --> 00:46:10.433
In fact, that's the largest
single component.

00:46:10.433 --> 00:46:12.733
44% of our electricity in

00:46:12.733 --> 00:46:14.833
Connecticut comes from nuclear.

00:46:14.833 --> 00:46:19.633
And our CO2 emissions, on
average, are pretty low

00:46:19.633 --> 00:46:22.600
because of that.

00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:26.700
Ohio doesn't have too much
coal of its own.

00:46:26.700 --> 00:46:30.667
But West Virginia lies
just east of it.

00:46:30.667 --> 00:46:33.600
It shares a long border with
West Virginia, which is a

00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:36.667
strong coal-producing state.

00:46:36.667 --> 00:46:39.167
And so they ship the coal over
the border, burn it.

00:46:39.167 --> 00:46:44.533
And 86, 87% of the electricity
in Ohio is

00:46:44.533 --> 00:46:45.967
generated by coal burning.

00:46:49.233 --> 00:46:51.733
Oregon, on the other hand,
being on the West Coast,

00:46:51.733 --> 00:46:58.200
mountainous, heavy rainfall,
81% is hydroelectric.

00:46:58.200 --> 00:47:03.233
So here, within the same
country, within the US of A,

00:47:03.233 --> 00:47:05.733
because of the way these
states are located in

00:47:05.733 --> 00:47:10.600
different provinces, you've got
three completely different

00:47:10.600 --> 00:47:16.267
dominant electrical energy
sources hydroelectric, coal,

00:47:16.267 --> 00:47:18.600
and nuclear.

00:47:18.600 --> 00:47:20.267
So there is a lot of variability
out there.

00:47:20.267 --> 00:47:25.833
And it depends on what's
available nearby, basically.

00:47:25.833 --> 00:47:27.100
Any questions on this?

00:47:30.900 --> 00:47:31.900
That was a lot.

00:47:31.900 --> 00:47:33.300
Let's finish it for today.

00:47:33.300 --> 00:47:36.433
And on Wednesday, we'll
do the renewables.

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.560
Today's lecture basically is
titled "A Union Without

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:07.750
Power."
 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:10.030
In past years I've titled it,
"Powers --

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:12.255
"Problems of the
Confederation,"

00:00:12.255 --> 00:00:14.800
and you'll see why,
by the end of the lecture.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.396
On Tuesday I started to talk
about the larger question of the

00:00:19.396 --> 00:00:23.840
legacy of the Revolution and the
process of governance,

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.656
and I started us off by talking
about the drafting of state

00:00:27.656 --> 00:00:30.815
constitutions and the drafting
of the Articles of

00:00:30.815 --> 00:00:32.000
Confederation.
 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.028
And in a sense,
one uniting theme that ran

00:00:35.028 --> 00:00:39.091
through both parts of that
lecture was the ways in which

00:00:39.091 --> 00:00:43.745
the states and their rights and
their sovereignty were really at

00:00:43.745 --> 00:00:45.740
the center of things.
 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:48.313
In a way, you could say that
that entire lecture was about

00:00:48.313 --> 00:00:50.976
the states, even though it was
about--really talking about a

00:00:50.976 --> 00:00:51.970
way to unify them.
 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:55.879
Certainly, you can see that in
the content of the Articles

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:58.958
themselves,
and the ways in which they were

00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:03.058
largely centered on defining and
limiting the amount of power

00:01:03.058 --> 00:01:06.340
that was given to the
Confederation Congress.

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:11.409
Well, today what we're going to
look at is the impact of that.

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:14.909
We're going to basically be
looking at how the Articles

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.116
played out in the 1780s,
given the amount of power that

00:01:18.116 --> 00:01:21.055
they had,
or the amount of power that

00:01:21.055 --> 00:01:24.424
they didn't have--
but one way or another we're

00:01:24.424 --> 00:01:26.879
going to see what happened in
the 1780s.

00:01:26.879 --> 00:01:30.647
And as an introduction to that,
I want to talk for just a few

00:01:30.647 --> 00:01:34.479
minutes about some of the actual
debates in Congress about the

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:37.927
Articles themselves--
some of the things that gave

00:01:37.927 --> 00:01:41.415
people in Congress pause when
the Articles were being

00:01:41.415 --> 00:01:43.751
written--
because, as you'll see,

00:01:43.751 --> 00:01:47.546
this reveals a lot about the
mindset of the time regarding

00:01:47.546 --> 00:01:50.010
centralized power and state
power.

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.114
And understanding that mindset
is going to explain some of what

00:01:53.114 --> 00:01:55.769
we're going to see in the bulk
of today's lecture,

00:01:55.769 --> 00:01:59.190
which is really going to be
looking at events that took

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:00.519
place in the 1780s.
 

00:02:00.519 --> 00:02:03.507
I'm also going to mention these
things right now that I'm going

00:02:03.507 --> 00:02:06.448
to talk about briefly because in
a couple of lectures from now

00:02:06.448 --> 00:02:08.860
when we begin talking about the
Constitution,

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.280
you're going to see them
basically all crop up again.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.240
So just a few minutes about the
debate over the Articles.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.692
Now one thing worth noting is
that even as Congress was trying

00:02:20.692 --> 00:02:23.318
to figure out some form of
union,

00:02:23.318 --> 00:02:27.151
even the people on the
committee appointed to draft the

00:02:27.151 --> 00:02:31.337
Articles of Confederation were
not entirely at ease with the

00:02:31.337 --> 00:02:34.389
idea of centralizing power in
that way.

00:02:34.389 --> 00:02:37.071
So this is just a random
comment, but it's from Edward

00:02:37.071 --> 00:02:40.468
Rutledge of South Carolina,
and it's a private letter that

00:02:40.468 --> 00:02:43.586
he wrote to a friend--
and he was actually on the

00:02:43.586 --> 00:02:47.520
Congressional committee that was
given the task of writing--

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.929
coming up with something that
would be ultimately the Articles

00:02:49.929 --> 00:02:50.680
of Confederation.
 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.360
So this is what Rutledge says
to his friend:

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.389
"If the Plan now proposed
should be adopted nothing less

00:02:57.389 --> 00:03:00.949
than Ruin to some Colonies will
be the Consequence.

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:03.960
The Idea of destroying all
Provincial Distinctions and

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:07.312
making every thing of the most
minute kind bend to what they

00:03:07.312 --> 00:03:10.712
call the good of the whole,
is in other Terms to say that

00:03:10.712 --> 00:03:14.098
these Colonies must be subject
to the Government of the Eastern

00:03:14.098 --> 00:03:14.810
Provinces.
 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.920
The Force of their Arms I hold
exceeding Cheap,

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:18.530
but ...
 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.220
I dread their overruling
Influence in council.

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.052
I dread their low Cunning,
and those leveling Principles

00:03:24.052 --> 00:03:26.990
which Men without Character and
without Fortune in general

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:30.001
possess,
which are so captivating to the

00:03:30.001 --> 00:03:33.548
lower class of Mankind,
and which will occasion such a

00:03:33.548 --> 00:03:37.030
fluctuation of Property as to
introduce the greatest disorder.

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.556
I am resolved to vest the
Congress with no more power than

00:03:40.556 --> 00:03:42.660
what is absolutely necessary ...
 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.282
for I am confident if
surrendered into the Hands of

00:03:45.282 --> 00:03:48.220
others a most pernicious use
will be made of it."

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.578
Okay.
 

00:03:48.578 --> 00:03:52.310
So listen to some of what
Rutledge just said there.

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.613
Okay.
 

00:03:52.613 --> 00:03:55.830
He's afraid that making
everything bend to the good of

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:59.536
the whole is basically saying
the same thing as subjecting all

00:03:59.536 --> 00:04:02.389
of the colonies to the eastern
provinces--

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:04.758
and by eastern provinces,
he means New England.

00:04:04.758 --> 00:04:06.835
He says, 'Well,
as soon as we do sort of bend

00:04:06.835 --> 00:04:08.864
the minutest thing to the good
of the whole,

00:04:08.864 --> 00:04:10.938
New England is just going to
take over.'

00:04:10.938 --> 00:04:13.776
That's basically what he is
saying in that letter:

00:04:13.776 --> 00:04:16.209
I don't want to be ruled by New
England.

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:19.670
And then right after that he
says, "The Force of their

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:21.819
Arms I hold exceeding
Cheap."

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:22.045
Okay.
 

00:04:22.045 --> 00:04:23.670
'I'm not scared of them
militarily.

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:25.629
We could beat them in a fight.
 

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:29.132
However, that low cunning those
kinds of people have,

00:04:29.132 --> 00:04:31.490
they will take over in
councils.'

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.829
Right?
 

00:04:31.829 --> 00:04:33.360
'They'll control Congress.
 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.545
I don't like the whole idea of
being governed by New England

00:04:36.545 --> 00:04:39.625
and because of that I'm not
entirely sure about this whole

00:04:39.625 --> 00:04:41.569
Articles of Confederation idea.'
 

00:04:41.569 --> 00:04:44.129
So how's that for spirit of
league of friendship?

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:45.952
[laughs]
That guy is on the committee

00:04:45.952 --> 00:04:48.029
that's actually drafting the
document,

00:04:48.029 --> 00:04:52.220
and he's that suspicious about
regional prejudices,

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.269
about New England trying to
take over.

00:04:54.269 --> 00:04:58.365
So that just gives you a little
bit of a sense of how uneasy

00:04:58.365 --> 00:05:02.598
people were with centralizing
power in any way on this sort of

00:05:02.598 --> 00:05:06.653
nationalesque kind of level,
particularly given their fears

00:05:06.653 --> 00:05:10.007
about giving up some of the
power and sovereignty that was

00:05:10.007 --> 00:05:12.360
held by their own independent
states.

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.773
Now once Congress actually
began debating the Articles

00:05:15.773 --> 00:05:19.766
there were actually three main
controversies I'm going to bring

00:05:19.766 --> 00:05:21.607
up now,
and for obvious reasons--as I

00:05:21.607 --> 00:05:23.959
mention them--
because you'll see why they all

00:05:23.959 --> 00:05:26.860
come up again as soon as we
begin talking about the

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:27.790
Constitution.
 

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:31.396
These three things all helped
to slow down and complicate

00:05:31.396 --> 00:05:34.834
debate over the Articles,
so that even though they start

00:05:34.834 --> 00:05:36.850
talking about the Articles in
1776,

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:39.824
there's a reason why it takes
all the way until November of

00:05:39.824 --> 00:05:42.800
1777 for Congress to decide that
they're done with them.

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:43.142
Okay.
 

00:05:43.142 --> 00:05:47.339
So the first of these three
controversies not surprisingly--

00:05:47.339 --> 00:05:49.064
I bet I could even ask you to
guess them and you probably

00:05:49.064 --> 00:05:50.824
would guess them,
but the first one is

00:05:50.824 --> 00:05:53.050
representation--
surprise.

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:54.620
Not a surprise at all.
 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:57.877
The idea of representation
caused an extended debate over

00:05:57.877 --> 00:06:01.077
whether voting in Congress once
again should be based on

00:06:01.077 --> 00:06:03.290
population--
which is what the larger states

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:04.278
want--
or one vote,

00:06:04.278 --> 00:06:07.778
one state--which is obviously
what the smaller states want.

00:06:07.778 --> 00:06:10.100
As James Wilson of Pennsylvania
put it,

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:14.016
"It is strange that
annexing the name of 'State' to

00:06:14.016 --> 00:06:16.851
ten thousand men,
should give them an equal right

00:06:16.851 --> 00:06:17.810
with forty thousand.
 

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:21.470
This must be the effect of
magic, not of reason."

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:21.812
Okay.
 

00:06:21.812 --> 00:06:24.629
That argument appears--almost
verbatim--

00:06:24.629 --> 00:06:26.964
but certainly that argument
appears again when once again

00:06:26.964 --> 00:06:28.550
we're talking about
representation,

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:30.800
centralized power,
the Constitution.

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:34.478
Not surprisingly,
related to representation,

00:06:34.478 --> 00:06:39.267
the second controversial topic
I'm going to raise here is

00:06:39.267 --> 00:06:40.379
taxation.
 

00:06:40.379 --> 00:06:44.074
There was an extended debate
over whether the common expenses

00:06:44.074 --> 00:06:47.954
of the war should be divided up
among the states on the basis of

00:06:47.954 --> 00:06:50.586
total population,
including slaves,

00:06:50.586 --> 00:06:53.970
or on the basis of the free
population only.

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:56.459
So here we have taxation,
representation,

00:06:56.459 --> 00:06:59.584
and slavery all bound together
happily in one issue that

00:06:59.584 --> 00:07:01.970
obviously is going to be
controversial,

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:04.389
and obviously is not going to
go away,

00:07:04.389 --> 00:07:08.089
and is going to come back the
very next occasion when they're

00:07:08.089 --> 00:07:11.360
talking about representation and
centralized power.

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:13.992
So representation,
taxation, and the third main

00:07:13.992 --> 00:07:17.601
controversy that slowed down the
passage of the Articles was the

00:07:17.601 --> 00:07:20.300
question of the West,
western territories.

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:23.517
Not surprisingly,
there was a big division

00:07:23.517 --> 00:07:28.699
between large landed states with
extensive western land claims--

00:07:28.699 --> 00:07:31.470
states like Massachusetts,
Connecticut,

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:33.589
New York, Virginia,
North Carolina--

00:07:33.589 --> 00:07:36.990
and small landless states like
Maryland,

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:40.529
Delaware, New Jersey,
New Hampshire.

00:07:40.529 --> 00:07:44.379
Landless states saw the
Confederation Congress as a sort

00:07:44.379 --> 00:07:48.440
of successor to the Crown's
property rights in the West.

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:50.370
So in other words,
smaller states,

00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:53.423
landless states,
wanted Congress to take over

00:07:53.423 --> 00:07:57.726
vast western territorial plains
and then convert them into some

00:07:57.726 --> 00:08:01.961
kind of a common stock of land
whose sale could help discharge

00:08:01.961 --> 00:08:04.459
some of the national war debt.
 

00:08:04.459 --> 00:08:07.413
So that's what the smaller
states or the landless states

00:08:07.413 --> 00:08:07.790
want.
 

00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:10.389
And the idea behind that--the
logic behind that--

00:08:10.389 --> 00:08:13.028
was that what was gained at
common expense--

00:08:13.028 --> 00:08:16.639
independence and control of
those western lands--

00:08:16.639 --> 00:08:20.209
should be used for common
benefit.

00:08:20.209 --> 00:08:22.190
Now obviously,
the states that owned western

00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:24.863
lands are going to feel really
differently about that whole

00:08:24.863 --> 00:08:26.867
issue,
but it's not surprising that

00:08:26.867 --> 00:08:28.899
that would be a point of
controversy.

00:08:28.899 --> 00:08:29.254
Okay.
 

00:08:29.254 --> 00:08:33.018
So those are three central
concerns over the Articles:

00:08:33.018 --> 00:08:35.857
representation,
taxation, and the western

00:08:35.857 --> 00:08:36.639
lands.
 

00:08:36.639 --> 00:08:40.980
Thanks to issues like those,
the Articles were debated from

00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:43.750
mid-1776 through November of
1777,

00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:47.191
when they finally were
completed and then submitted to

00:08:47.191 --> 00:08:49.139
the states for ratification.
 

00:08:49.139 --> 00:08:53.274
The main reason why debate
stopped at that point in 1777 is

00:08:53.274 --> 00:08:56.982
not because everyone decided
those questions had been

00:08:56.982 --> 00:08:59.860
settled,
but because of the American

00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:01.379
victory at Saratoga.
 

00:09:01.379 --> 00:09:05.748
So basically people realized if
the states weren't united into

00:09:05.748 --> 00:09:08.899
one joint political entity at
that point,

00:09:08.899 --> 00:09:13.288
it would be almost impossible
for them to get foreign aid.

00:09:13.288 --> 00:09:16.225
They had to at least prove that
they could unite somehow if they

00:09:16.225 --> 00:09:19.113
were going to convince foreign
countries that it was worthwhile

00:09:19.113 --> 00:09:21.490
investing in whatever was
happening in America.

00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:25.211
So signing the Articles of
Confederation and then sending

00:09:25.211 --> 00:09:29.333
them off for ratification was a
way of giving added credence to

00:09:29.333 --> 00:09:33.455
the American cause in the eyes
of the world at a very strategic

00:09:33.455 --> 00:09:34.320
moment.
 

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:37.955
As Samuel Chase of Maryland
wrote right in the midst of the

00:09:37.955 --> 00:09:41.080
debate over the Articles,
"what contract will a

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:43.868
foreign State make with us,
when we cannot agree among

00:09:43.868 --> 00:09:46.279
ourselves"--
which is a pretty good point.

00:09:46.279 --> 00:09:49.750
This basic reality led Congress
to complete the Articles,

00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:51.240
send it to the states.
 

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:54.288
The states ultimately--They
discussed them.

00:09:54.288 --> 00:09:58.287
Some came to a conclusion
quicker than others,

00:09:58.287 --> 00:10:03.618
and it was not until 1781 that
the Articles formally were put

00:10:03.618 --> 00:10:05.038
into effect.
 

00:10:05.038 --> 00:10:07.472
Now I want to turn to what
happened once the Articles

00:10:07.472 --> 00:10:10.210
actually went into effect,
and as we set out into this

00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:13.125
discussion I want to take just a
moment here to defend the

00:10:13.125 --> 00:10:14.658
Articles just a little bit.
 

00:10:14.658 --> 00:10:19.038
And I did this a little bit in
Tuesday's lecture too,

00:10:19.038 --> 00:10:21.472
because as you'll see--it'll be
very clear by the end of this

00:10:21.472 --> 00:10:24.539
lecture why I'm doing this--
it's very easy to listen to

00:10:24.539 --> 00:10:27.418
what happened in the 1780s and
conclude,

00:10:27.418 --> 00:10:30.727
'this is the most inadequate,
goofy form of government I can

00:10:30.727 --> 00:10:31.850
possibly imagine.'
 

00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:32.145
Right?
 

00:10:32.145 --> 00:10:35.017
Because all we're going to see
in this lecture is one after

00:10:35.017 --> 00:10:37.985
another after another instance
of this government not working

00:10:37.985 --> 00:10:38.629
so well.
 

00:10:38.629 --> 00:10:41.932
And it doesn't help that you
have all of these really

00:10:41.932 --> 00:10:44.788
strident nationalists in this
time period--

00:10:44.788 --> 00:10:46.350
we're going to hear from a
couple of them too--

00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:49.443
who throughout the 1780s,
and for some of them even in

00:10:49.443 --> 00:10:53.048
part of the 1770s,
felt really strongly that there

00:10:53.048 --> 00:10:56.808
needed to be a stronger
centralized government,

00:10:56.808 --> 00:11:00.048
and were really vocal in
expressing their doubts and

00:11:00.048 --> 00:11:03.538
expressing what they thought
really needed to happen.

00:11:03.538 --> 00:11:06.234
So Hamilton--Alexander Hamilton
is always griping about the weak

00:11:06.234 --> 00:11:07.927
government;
George Washington always

00:11:07.927 --> 00:11:09.590
griping about the weak
government.

00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:13.190
Added to the sort of bad PR for
the Articles of Confederation

00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:15.649
are the "Federalist"
essays,

00:11:15.649 --> 00:11:17.830
and I'll talk about them in a
couple of lectures too,

00:11:17.830 --> 00:11:20.100
but, as we'll see when we look
at them,

00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:23.379
the "Federalist"
essays are not objective;

00:11:23.379 --> 00:11:25.696
they're written with an
agenda--I'll go into this in

00:11:25.696 --> 00:11:28.948
more detail later--
but they are aimed at proving

00:11:28.948 --> 00:11:33.470
that the proposed Constitution
is absolutely necessary,

00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:36.923
and one of the ways in which
they did that was to just rip

00:11:36.923 --> 00:11:39.470
the Articles of Confederation to
shreds.

00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:39.928
Right?
 

00:11:39.928 --> 00:11:44.058
To prove that the Constitution
was really necessary,

00:11:44.058 --> 00:11:45.703
one of the things the
"Federalist"

00:11:45.703 --> 00:11:47.923
essays really try to accomplish
is proving how horrible and

00:11:47.923 --> 00:11:50.408
incompetent and inadequate the
Articles of Confederation are.

00:11:50.408 --> 00:11:52.714
And if you believe that,
then you're going to be even

00:11:52.714 --> 00:11:54.000
more likely to think:
'oh,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.312
wow, if they're so bad maybe
this Constitution actually

00:11:56.312 --> 00:11:58.753
really is--
we absolutely have to go for

00:11:58.753 --> 00:11:59.090
it.'
 

00:11:59.090 --> 00:12:01.687
So it was part of a sort of
rhetorical strategy in the

00:12:01.687 --> 00:12:04.090
"Federalist"
essays to make the Articles

00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:06.116
look really bad--
not that they need a lot of

00:12:06.116 --> 00:12:07.610
help necessarily,
but they were really

00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:09.394
emphasizing that in the
"Federalist"

00:12:09.394 --> 00:12:09.788
essays.
 

00:12:09.788 --> 00:12:14.308
So for a moment--all I'm trying
to say with this is,

00:12:14.308 --> 00:12:16.710
just consider that there are
all of these reasons why,

00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:18.950
for natural reasons,
for bad PR reasons,

00:12:18.950 --> 00:12:23.283
it's natural for us to look at
the Articles and think of them

00:12:23.283 --> 00:12:27.013
as just a big mistake,
but of course the problem with

00:12:27.013 --> 00:12:29.450
that kind of reasoning is
presentism.

00:12:29.450 --> 00:12:29.799
Right?
 

00:12:29.799 --> 00:12:33.308
It's judging the Articles based
on what we know comes next.

00:12:33.308 --> 00:12:36.585
So we know, right down the pike
there's that Constitution just

00:12:36.585 --> 00:12:39.102
waiting to happen;
so we know there's a stronger

00:12:39.102 --> 00:12:41.417
government coming;
we know that it works because

00:12:41.417 --> 00:12:42.360
it's still working.
 

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:45.573
So we know, in a sense,
the end of this particular

00:12:45.573 --> 00:12:48.876
story and knowing that,
it's very hard for us to look

00:12:48.876 --> 00:12:51.964
at the Articles and give them--
they don't get much respect--to

00:12:51.964 --> 00:12:54.399
give very much respect to the
Articles of Confederation.

00:12:54.399 --> 00:12:57.455
But that's not quite fair to
judge those historical actors in

00:12:57.455 --> 00:13:00.104
that moment in that way,
because of course they don't

00:13:00.104 --> 00:13:01.529
know what's coming next.
 

00:13:01.529 --> 00:13:03.480
They're acting in the moment.
 

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:06.533
They're acting based on lessons
they've just learned,

00:13:06.533 --> 00:13:08.590
with the knowledge of the
moment.

00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:11.306
So I think rather--even after
everything I say in today's

00:13:11.306 --> 00:13:13.549
lecture--
rather than condemning the

00:13:13.549 --> 00:13:17.102
Articles as a kind of broken or
faulty or sad system of

00:13:17.102 --> 00:13:20.166
government,
we should instead really

00:13:20.166 --> 00:13:24.058
understand them in the context
of the time,

00:13:24.058 --> 00:13:27.524
and really understand the ways
in which they represent

00:13:27.524 --> 00:13:31.577
precisely what should have been
the first attempt at a national

00:13:31.577 --> 00:13:35.434
government based on the fears
and assumptions that prevailed

00:13:35.434 --> 00:13:38.048
in the United States at that
time.

00:13:38.048 --> 00:13:40.822
As I talked about on Tuesday,
there were natural fears about

00:13:40.822 --> 00:13:42.889
a strong centralized national
government--

00:13:42.889 --> 00:13:45.788
and of course there were,
given the Revolution has just

00:13:45.788 --> 00:13:46.379
happened.
 

00:13:46.379 --> 00:13:50.054
And given that people could
look back on the Revolution and

00:13:50.054 --> 00:13:51.259
say, 'Well, okay.
 

00:13:51.259 --> 00:13:53.779
We know that the Continental
Congress had problems but we

00:13:53.779 --> 00:13:56.010
won'--
people had some reason to

00:13:56.010 --> 00:13:58.644
assume: 'well,
that worked basically,

00:13:58.644 --> 00:14:02.099
so we'll kind of assume that
some version of that will

00:14:02.099 --> 00:14:05.879
continue to work as long as we
have some kind of a sense of

00:14:05.879 --> 00:14:07.250
common purpose.'
 

00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:10.495
And there is the problem,
and that is what we're going to

00:14:10.495 --> 00:14:13.586
see today,
because the unhappy surprise of

00:14:13.586 --> 00:14:16.830
the 1780s was that once the war
was over,

00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:20.721
there was not all that much of
a sense of common purpose

00:14:20.721 --> 00:14:21.428
anymore.
 

00:14:21.428 --> 00:14:25.961
So as I detail all of these
problems today with the

00:14:25.961 --> 00:14:28.113
Articles,
try to bear in mind that yes,

00:14:28.113 --> 00:14:30.350
they did not function as well
as people maybe hoped they would

00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:31.889
but that rather than a stupid
mistake,

00:14:31.889 --> 00:14:35.934
they were a logical first step
in a larger process of

00:14:35.934 --> 00:14:37.179
nation-making.
 

00:14:37.179 --> 00:14:38.830
They made sense as a first step.
 

00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:45.065
Now even before some of the
problems of the 1780s began to

00:14:45.065 --> 00:14:47.823
unfold,
there were already people who

00:14:47.823 --> 00:14:51.038
felt that the Continental
Congress had been frustratingly

00:14:51.038 --> 00:14:53.172
inadequate--
and we heard about some of

00:14:53.172 --> 00:14:55.836
these a couple of weeks back--
and not surprisingly,

00:14:55.836 --> 00:14:59.274
people who had been angry about
the Continental Congress are now

00:14:59.274 --> 00:15:01.950
irritated with the Confederation
Congress too.

00:15:01.950 --> 00:15:05.730
Often--or at least some of
these people had experienced in

00:15:05.730 --> 00:15:09.445
one way or another firsthand
frustrations because of what

00:15:09.445 --> 00:15:13.690
they viewed as the inadequacies
of these various congresses.

00:15:13.690 --> 00:15:16.096
So for example,
I mentioned I think actually in

00:15:16.096 --> 00:15:19.288
an earlier lecture that there
were some people at Washington's

00:15:19.288 --> 00:15:22.480
headquarters during the war who
experienced firsthand how hard

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:25.408
it was for Congress to get them
supplies and men,

00:15:25.408 --> 00:15:28.375
partly just because Congress
wasn't functioning necessarily

00:15:28.375 --> 00:15:28.990
very well.
 

00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:32.366
And so a lot of people at
Washington's headquarters during

00:15:32.366 --> 00:15:35.389
the war end up being really
strong nationalists,

00:15:35.389 --> 00:15:37.750
and Hamilton and Washington
obviously are among that group.

00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:40.854
But there is a whole string of
other people as well who are all

00:15:40.854 --> 00:15:43.707
writing letters to each other
throughout the 1780s saying,

00:15:43.707 --> 00:15:44.559
'We're dying.
 

00:15:44.559 --> 00:15:45.610
It's all going downhill.
 

00:15:45.610 --> 00:15:47.049
We have fought the war.
 

00:15:47.049 --> 00:15:48.918
We won. Now what's happening?'
 

00:15:48.918 --> 00:15:51.133
We'll hear a Washington letter
along these lines in just a

00:15:51.133 --> 00:15:51.908
couple of minutes.
 

00:15:51.908 --> 00:15:56.096
Other people who were unhappy
with the Confederation Congress

00:15:56.096 --> 00:16:00.563
were people who had attempted to
deal with foreign affairs during

00:16:00.563 --> 00:16:03.895
the Revolution,
and again on that front had

00:16:03.895 --> 00:16:06.548
seen how Congress had
dilly-dallied;

00:16:06.548 --> 00:16:09.850
it had failed to give
effective, efficient concrete

00:16:09.850 --> 00:16:10.840
instructions.
 

00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:15.408
And John Jay was one of those
people who distrusted what was--

00:16:15.408 --> 00:16:18.105
ever was going to happen with
the Articles because he'd seen

00:16:18.105 --> 00:16:20.940
what happened with a similar
congress during the Revolution.

00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:24.254
Some other people had been
actual members of the

00:16:24.254 --> 00:16:28.416
Continental Congress and found
themselves frustrated at some

00:16:28.416 --> 00:16:31.450
point about getting things
implemented.

00:16:31.450 --> 00:16:34.538
And James Madison falls into
that category.

00:16:34.538 --> 00:16:37.788
And obviously I'm just naming a
few random instances here.

00:16:37.788 --> 00:16:39.230
There are many other people who
felt this way.

00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:44.230
These men perceived what seemed
to them like a supreme irony.

00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:48.105
It would be the ideals and
principles of the Revolution

00:16:48.105 --> 00:16:52.337
that would tear apart the new
nation that the Revolution had

00:16:52.337 --> 00:16:53.200
created.
 

00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:56.246
So in their mind,
all of these fears about state

00:16:56.246 --> 00:16:58.565
sovereignty,
about concerns about

00:16:58.565 --> 00:17:00.850
centralized power,
about tyranny,

00:17:00.850 --> 00:17:04.358
about protecting property,
about protecting liberties--all

00:17:04.358 --> 00:17:07.617
of those things might actually
lead people to be so distrustful

00:17:07.617 --> 00:17:10.285
of a government,
that maybe it would bring the

00:17:10.285 --> 00:17:13.683
entire experiment in government
crashing down almost before it

00:17:13.683 --> 00:17:15.298
had had a chance to begin.
 

00:17:15.298 --> 00:17:20.640
Now what was it that so upset
these men about the 1780s?

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:24.650
So let's turn to some of the
events of the 1780s and see.

00:17:24.650 --> 00:17:28.921
Now for one thing right off the
cuff, the state of foreign

00:17:28.921 --> 00:17:32.366
relations in the 1780s seemed
alarming to them,

00:17:32.366 --> 00:17:35.440
particularly regarding Great
Britain.

00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:39.368
Despite the fact that Americans
had won the war--

00:17:39.368 --> 00:17:42.487
that they had negotiated a
treaty with Britain that had

00:17:42.487 --> 00:17:45.338
clear terms in it--
Britain was still putting up

00:17:45.338 --> 00:17:48.151
barriers and hurdles and
basically not being very

00:17:48.151 --> 00:17:49.029
cooperative.
 

00:17:49.029 --> 00:17:52.747
So throughout the 1780s they
largely refused to cooperate

00:17:52.747 --> 00:17:55.269
with aspects of the Treaty of
Paris.

00:17:55.269 --> 00:17:58.251
So for example,
although they had agreed to

00:17:58.251 --> 00:18:01.518
abandon their posts in the
western territories,

00:18:01.518 --> 00:18:03.009
they just didn't.
 

00:18:03.009 --> 00:18:03.634
'Sorry.
 

00:18:03.634 --> 00:18:06.130
[laughs]
We're still here.'

00:18:06.130 --> 00:18:10.430
They also implemented a number
of different trade restrictions.

00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:13.415
Some of them were implemented
not just towards the United

00:18:13.415 --> 00:18:16.486
States,
but America for example found

00:18:16.486 --> 00:18:21.208
itself suddenly unable to import
machine tools to build

00:18:21.208 --> 00:18:25.460
manufacturing institutions,
to build factories in America.

00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:28.420
Suddenly America found itself
unable to import these things.

00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:31.269
There were other places who
also were not being able to take

00:18:31.269 --> 00:18:33.900
these things from Britain,
but now that suddenly America's

00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:35.368
out of the British imperial
system,

00:18:35.368 --> 00:18:38.073
they don't have access to
things that they once had access

00:18:38.073 --> 00:18:40.079
to before,
and Britain is certainly not

00:18:40.079 --> 00:18:41.720
being cooperative on that front.
 

00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:45.368
Along similar lines,
the French and the Spanish were

00:18:45.368 --> 00:18:48.971
also proving difficult,
doing things like attempting to

00:18:48.971 --> 00:18:51.220
exercise control over the
Mississippi,

00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:54.570
to control shipping,
holding back attempts by

00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:57.769
Americans to expand throughout
the area.

00:18:57.769 --> 00:19:03.048
So just on the foreign affairs
front alone,

00:19:03.048 --> 00:19:05.021
things don't look really
thrilling and it's not at all

00:19:05.021 --> 00:19:07.328
clear what this Congress is
going to be able to do about it.

00:19:07.328 --> 00:19:10.256
And you can hear the impact of
these kinds of developments in a

00:19:10.256 --> 00:19:13.135
letter that Washington wrote to
a friend, and this is as early

00:19:13.135 --> 00:19:15.905
as 1784:
"The disinclination of the

00:19:15.905 --> 00:19:19.941
individual States to yield
competent powers to Congress for

00:19:19.941 --> 00:19:23.428
the Foederal Government,
their unreasonable jealousy of

00:19:23.428 --> 00:19:25.118
that body &amp;
of one another--

00:19:25.118 --> 00:19:27.890
&amp; the disposition which
seems to pervade each,

00:19:27.890 --> 00:19:31.269
of being all-wise &amp;
all-powerful within itself,

00:19:31.269 --> 00:19:34.029
will, if there is not a change
in the system,

00:19:34.029 --> 00:19:38.513
be our downfal as a nation.--
This is as clear to me as the A,

00:19:38.513 --> 00:19:39.470
B, C."
 

00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:41.733
It's as clear as the
alphabet--but that's a weird

00:19:41.733 --> 00:19:43.150
Washingtonian version of it.
 

00:19:43.150 --> 00:19:45.730
"This is as clear to me as
the A, B, C;

00:19:45.730 --> 00:19:48.009
&amp; I think we have opposed
Great Britain,

00:19:48.009 --> 00:19:50.628
&amp; have arrived at the
present state of peace &amp;

00:19:50.628 --> 00:19:52.846
independency,
to very little purpose,

00:19:52.846 --> 00:19:55.390
if we cannot conquer our own
prejudices.

00:19:55.390 --> 00:19:57.541
The powers of Europe begin to
see this, &amp;

00:19:57.541 --> 00:20:00.329
our newly acquired friends the
British, are already ...

00:20:00.329 --> 00:20:02.800
acting upon this ground;
&amp; wisely too,

00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:05.490
if we are determined to
persevere in our folly.

00:20:05.490 --> 00:20:08.603
They know that individual
opposition to their measures is

00:20:08.603 --> 00:20:10.806
futile,
and boast that we are not

00:20:10.806 --> 00:20:14.558
sufficiently united as a Nation
to give a general one!--

00:20:14.558 --> 00:20:17.240
Is not the indignity alone,
of this declaration ...

00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:20.378
sufficient to stimulate us to
vest more extensive &amp;

00:20:20.378 --> 00:20:23.111
adequate powers in the
sovereign of these United

00:20:23.111 --> 00:20:24.098
States?"
 

00:20:24.098 --> 00:20:24.351
Okay.
 

00:20:24.351 --> 00:20:27.471
That's one passage of a stream
of letters of this sort that are

00:20:27.471 --> 00:20:30.038
being sent back and forth
throughout the 1780s,

00:20:30.038 --> 00:20:32.481
so of course they're being sent
from one nationalist guy to

00:20:32.481 --> 00:20:34.859
another nationalist guy,
so they are sort of preaching

00:20:34.859 --> 00:20:35.460
to the choir.
 

00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:36.420
Right? 'This is horrible.
 

00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:37.339
Yes, it's horrible.
 

00:20:37.339 --> 00:20:38.099
It's really horrible.
 

00:20:38.099 --> 00:20:39.160
Yes, it's really horrible.'
 

00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:40.769
Thanks.
 

00:20:40.769 --> 00:20:42.294
[laughs]
They all agree with each other

00:20:42.294 --> 00:20:43.980
but they all strike that kind of
a tone.

00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:46.670
So that's just in the world of
foreign affairs.

00:20:46.670 --> 00:20:51.210
Domestically,
things seemed equally alarming.

00:20:51.210 --> 00:20:54.737
The Confederation Congress
could not even manage to

00:20:54.737 --> 00:20:58.688
consistently summon a quorum of
states so that they could

00:20:58.688 --> 00:21:00.170
conduct business.
 

00:21:00.170 --> 00:21:03.776
Typical of many complaining
letters of the period is one by

00:21:03.776 --> 00:21:07.393
Rufus King of New York in 1785,
and he wrote to a friend:

00:21:07.393 --> 00:21:10.038
"We have only five states
represented.

00:21:10.038 --> 00:21:12.781
Pennsylvania and Connecticut
are expected -- when they are

00:21:12.781 --> 00:21:14.368
here we can form a House."
 

00:21:14.368 --> 00:21:14.795
Oh, boy.
 

00:21:14.795 --> 00:21:18.038
We're going to be almost able
to actually do something as soon

00:21:18.038 --> 00:21:20.380
as Pennsylvania and Connecticut
get here.

00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:22.200
Thank you very much.
 

00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:25.758
Again, not a lot of excitement
and power and energy being

00:21:25.758 --> 00:21:27.410
vested in this Congress.
 

00:21:27.410 --> 00:21:32.451
Why were there so few delegates
even bothering to attend

00:21:32.451 --> 00:21:33.460
Congress?
 

00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:35.548
Well, for one thing,
as I sort of hinted in the last

00:21:35.548 --> 00:21:36.906
lecture,
people were much more

00:21:36.906 --> 00:21:39.240
interested in what was going on
in their own states,

00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:41.578
so a lot of people just
remained at home.

00:21:41.578 --> 00:21:45.897
Centralized issues that
affected other states very often

00:21:45.897 --> 00:21:50.374
seemed to people to be of
secondary importance to concerns

00:21:50.374 --> 00:21:52.180
in their own state.
 

00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:56.038
And an extreme example of what
I'm talking about here--

00:21:56.038 --> 00:21:58.298
a sort of good example of
people being more concerned with

00:21:58.298 --> 00:22:00.519
their own state than with
anything national in scope--

00:22:00.519 --> 00:22:05.575
took place in Vermont beginning
in 1777 and continuing through

00:22:05.575 --> 00:22:06.568
the 1780s.
 

00:22:06.568 --> 00:22:08.788
Now basically,
for a long period of time,

00:22:08.788 --> 00:22:12.414
New York and New Hampshire both
claimed possession of the

00:22:12.414 --> 00:22:16.430
territory that eventually would
become the state of Vermont.

00:22:16.430 --> 00:22:21.109
Well, in 1777 residents of that
territory led by Ethan Allen

00:22:21.109 --> 00:22:26.028
declared their independence from
New York and New Hampshire.

00:22:26.028 --> 00:22:27.954
So the Revolution is inspiring
in many ways,

00:22:27.954 --> 00:22:30.104
and here you can see the power
of the Revolution:

00:22:30.104 --> 00:22:31.848
'We're declaring our
independence!'

00:22:31.848 --> 00:22:34.618
So they declare themselves,
quote, "the Independent

00:22:34.618 --> 00:22:36.029
Republic of Vermont."
 

00:22:36.029 --> 00:22:38.650
We are now the Independent
Republic of Vermont;

00:22:38.650 --> 00:22:39.608
so there.
 

00:22:39.608 --> 00:22:41.463
And they actually begin to
write up their own

00:22:41.463 --> 00:22:43.655
constitution--and you can really
see the influence of

00:22:43.655 --> 00:22:44.710
revolutionary events.
 

00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:47.904
Naturally enough,
the governor of New York became

00:22:47.904 --> 00:22:50.500
concerned about this because to
him,

00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:53.471
part of his state was trying to
secede and this was not a good

00:22:53.471 --> 00:22:56.559
thing,
so he pleaded with New York's

00:22:56.559 --> 00:23:01.038
congressional delegates to
please do something,

00:23:01.038 --> 00:23:03.202
like maybe declare that that
territory belongs to New York

00:23:03.202 --> 00:23:05.403
and get the other states to
agree with this so this problem

00:23:05.403 --> 00:23:06.048
will go away.
 

00:23:06.048 --> 00:23:10.186
New York's governor,
as well as a number of other

00:23:10.186 --> 00:23:12.686
people,
became more concerned when they

00:23:12.686 --> 00:23:15.593
heard that Ethan Allen was
supposedly negotiating in one

00:23:15.593 --> 00:23:18.816
way or another with the British
to abandon Vermont's claims to

00:23:18.816 --> 00:23:21.827
independence if the British
would recognize their separate

00:23:21.827 --> 00:23:25.068
status,
supposedly.

00:23:25.068 --> 00:23:25.570
So--Okay.
 

00:23:25.570 --> 00:23:29.022
Supposedly, we have a territory
declaring itself an independent

00:23:29.022 --> 00:23:32.308
republic and then negotiating
with the British in the middle

00:23:32.308 --> 00:23:33.200
of the war.
 

00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:33.454
Right?
 

00:23:33.454 --> 00:23:36.140
'Accept us as a republic and we
won't fight for independence.'

00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:38.098
It's a little alarming.
 

00:23:38.098 --> 00:23:41.749
So among all of the reasons why
that's unacceptable and

00:23:41.749 --> 00:23:43.817
alarming,
one major reason is,

00:23:43.817 --> 00:23:47.529
it obviously represents the
dismemberment of potentially two

00:23:47.529 --> 00:23:48.160
states.
 

00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:48.510
Right?
 

00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:50.150
New York and New Hampshire.
 

00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:53.119
So what does the Congress do?
 

00:23:53.119 --> 00:23:54.920
Nothing.
 

00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:57.096
As a delegate from Maryland
wrote home to his state

00:23:57.096 --> 00:23:59.022
governor,
he had been called back to

00:23:59.022 --> 00:24:02.098
Congress because of the supposed
crisis of Vermont but,

00:24:02.098 --> 00:24:05.405
quote, "we have business
enough on our hands without

00:24:05.405 --> 00:24:07.650
carving out more at this
time."

00:24:07.650 --> 00:24:09.549
So this guy is basically
saying, 'Please.

00:24:09.549 --> 00:24:10.720
We have enough to do.
 

00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:14.009
I don't care about this whole
thing, this Vermont thing.

00:24:14.009 --> 00:24:15.460
What a pain.
 

00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:18.325
Why don't they just sort of
deal with it up there wherever

00:24:18.325 --> 00:24:19.230
it's happening?'
 

00:24:19.230 --> 00:24:23.359
Vermont, seeing something of a
lack of action on the national

00:24:23.359 --> 00:24:25.176
front,
became a little more

00:24:25.176 --> 00:24:28.830
aggressive, began to annex to
their republic some towns in New

00:24:28.830 --> 00:24:29.608
Hampshire.
 

00:24:29.608 --> 00:24:33.042
There were a little--a few
little skirmishes with New York

00:24:33.042 --> 00:24:36.067
in 1781 on the border,
and then ominously,

00:24:36.067 --> 00:24:40.701
everything got very quiet on
the border between Vermont and

00:24:40.701 --> 00:24:41.500
Canada.
 

00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:41.742
Right?
 

00:24:41.742 --> 00:24:43.852
So people again are thinking,
'are these guys somehow

00:24:43.852 --> 00:24:45.150
negotiating with the British?
 

00:24:45.150 --> 00:24:47.929
Is there some weird thing
happening between these guys and

00:24:47.929 --> 00:24:50.660
the British, and now people are
sort of skirmishing about

00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:51.880
borders in New York?'
 

00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:54.038
Well, Congress kind of panicked
at this point,

00:24:54.038 --> 00:24:56.392
because you add all of this up
and it seems scary,

00:24:56.392 --> 00:24:58.358
strange, and potentially
threatening.

00:24:58.358 --> 00:25:01.871
So they made some sort of a
vague counter-deal with Vermont

00:25:01.871 --> 00:25:04.898
that's like, 'okay,
okay, okay, we'll sort of think

00:25:04.898 --> 00:25:07.200
about this whole statehood
thing.'

00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:11.124
Vermont certainly held back
from talking with the British

00:25:11.124 --> 00:25:14.557
and then Congress failed to
follow through at all,

00:25:14.557 --> 00:25:16.240
so nothing happened.
 

00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:19.680
Yorktown and the seeming end of
the war came in 1781,

00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:21.118
the British lost interest in
Vermont,

00:25:21.118 --> 00:25:24.134
Congress lost interest in
Vermont, and Vermont remained in

00:25:24.134 --> 00:25:27.559
this kind of limbo,
unknowing what it was.

00:25:27.559 --> 00:25:28.890
Is it an independent republic?
 

00:25:28.890 --> 00:25:30.200
Is it part of New York?
 

00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:31.619
Is it part of New Hampshire?
 

00:25:31.619 --> 00:25:32.359
Is it a state?
 

00:25:32.359 --> 00:25:33.769
Is it not a state?
 

00:25:33.769 --> 00:25:36.307
And this persisted throughout
the entire 1780s,

00:25:36.307 --> 00:25:39.729
this weird limbo for the people
of Vermont, nobody really quite

00:25:39.729 --> 00:25:41.440
deciding what was going on.
 

00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:45.184
A similar problem took place
when part of North Carolina

00:25:45.184 --> 00:25:48.930
attempted to secede from the
state of North Carolina and

00:25:48.930 --> 00:25:51.788
declared itself the state of
Franklin;

00:25:51.788 --> 00:25:54.779
we are now the state of
Franklin.

00:25:54.779 --> 00:25:56.394
[laughs]
I just love the fact that the

00:25:56.394 --> 00:25:58.576
Revolution is inspiring all
these people to declare

00:25:58.576 --> 00:26:00.058
themselves independent states.
 

00:26:00.058 --> 00:26:04.259
So in 1784, basically the way
that this works is,

00:26:04.259 --> 00:26:06.460
you have people living on the
western territories,

00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:09.608
the western edge of lands that
belong to North Carolina,

00:26:09.608 --> 00:26:13.731
and they hear that North
Carolina--to contribute to the

00:26:13.731 --> 00:26:16.868
paying back of war debts--
is going to give up these

00:26:16.868 --> 00:26:18.108
western lands to the Congress.
 

00:26:18.108 --> 00:26:18.373
Right?
 

00:26:18.373 --> 00:26:20.480
I've already talked about that
being discussed.

00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:23.651
So these people in these
western territories say,

00:26:23.651 --> 00:26:24.509
'Oh, great.
 

00:26:24.509 --> 00:26:26.339
Well, if the lands are being
given up to Congress,

00:26:26.339 --> 00:26:27.608
then we're kind of
independent.'

00:26:27.608 --> 00:26:29.170
So they petition Congress and
say, 'Fine.

00:26:29.170 --> 00:26:31.490
Then we are now the independent
state of Franklin.

00:26:31.490 --> 00:26:33.318
Recognize us as a new state.'
 

00:26:33.318 --> 00:26:36.165
And they begin drafting their
own constitution,

00:26:36.165 --> 00:26:37.279
I think in 1785.
 

00:26:37.279 --> 00:26:40.291
We're an independent state and
now we're going to have a new

00:26:40.291 --> 00:26:41.618
republican constitution.
 

00:26:41.618 --> 00:26:45.386
Some western territories of
Virginia discussed joining the

00:26:45.386 --> 00:26:46.710
state of Franklin.
 

00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:49.616
There was some discussion of
the Cherokee being accepted into

00:26:49.616 --> 00:26:50.779
the state of Franklin.
 

00:26:50.779 --> 00:26:50.991
Okay.
 

00:26:50.991 --> 00:26:53.548
So we have a little brewing new
state happening here in North

00:26:53.548 --> 00:26:54.058
Carolina.
 

00:26:54.058 --> 00:26:57.979
The problem is North Carolina
took back their cession of

00:26:57.979 --> 00:26:59.118
western lands.
 

00:26:59.118 --> 00:27:01.741
There was a whole flurry of
controversy about this issue,

00:27:01.741 --> 00:27:03.848
and were other states giving up
their land?

00:27:03.848 --> 00:27:06.125
Yes, no, we don't know--so
North Carolina said,

00:27:06.125 --> 00:27:07.558
'Well, forget it,
whatever.

00:27:07.558 --> 00:27:09.278
We're not--You're not getting
the land.'

00:27:09.278 --> 00:27:12.731
This now left the people of the
state of Franklin in a state of

00:27:12.731 --> 00:27:15.404
limbo, and they petitioned to
Congress and asked,

00:27:15.404 --> 00:27:17.410
'Well, please give us
statehood.

00:27:17.410 --> 00:27:19.491
We don't know what's happening
with all this land stuff but

00:27:19.491 --> 00:27:21.000
hey, we're here drafting a
constitution.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:21.900
Give us statehood.'
 

00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:25.238
And ultimately Congress didn't
really act concerning the state

00:27:25.238 --> 00:27:27.767
of Franklin,
and it's North Carolina that

00:27:27.767 --> 00:27:30.939
ultimately dealt with the
question and suppressed the

00:27:30.939 --> 00:27:31.608
problem.
 

00:27:31.608 --> 00:27:33.288
There's a--When I was poking
around,

00:27:33.288 --> 00:27:37.130
researching this this morning,
I found some book--

00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:39.961
I think it's called something
like The Lost State of

00:27:39.961 --> 00:27:42.711
Franklin--
and it's like the lost city of

00:27:42.711 --> 00:27:43.348
Atlantis.
 

00:27:43.348 --> 00:27:46.169
The lost state of Franklin had
this little tiny moment of

00:27:46.169 --> 00:27:48.232
almost existing and then
"poof,"

00:27:48.232 --> 00:27:49.190
it was put out.
 

00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:49.602
Okay.
 

00:27:49.602 --> 00:27:53.730
So faced by the seeming
dismemberment of states,

00:27:53.730 --> 00:27:57.308
faced by at least discussion of
a state joining the British

00:27:57.308 --> 00:27:59.901
during the war,
Congress has not--we have not

00:27:59.901 --> 00:28:02.710
seen a lot of action here on the
part of the Congress.

00:28:02.710 --> 00:28:05.500
Now in these cases,
Congress, just couldn't muster

00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:08.405
the interest or the energy to
act on behalf of these

00:28:08.405 --> 00:28:09.660
individual states.
 

00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:12.707
In other cases,
Congress actually did respond,

00:28:12.707 --> 00:28:16.500
but it had no power to do
anything other than observe and

00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:17.990
report and advise.
 

00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:20.523
So for example,
during the early 1780s there

00:28:20.523 --> 00:28:24.058
was a boundary dispute between
Pennsylvania and New York,

00:28:24.058 --> 00:28:26.773
and the Congress actually
appointed a committee to

00:28:26.773 --> 00:28:29.453
investigate the issue,
and the committee actually

00:28:29.453 --> 00:28:32.590
reported a decision about where
they thought the boundary should

00:28:32.590 --> 00:28:32.990
fall.
 

00:28:32.990 --> 00:28:34.635
So there is a case in which
Congress acts and says,

00:28:34.635 --> 00:28:34.900
'Okay.
 

00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:36.618
This is where the boundary
should be.'

00:28:36.618 --> 00:28:39.704
End of controversy,
you would think,

00:28:39.704 --> 00:28:41.380
but of course no.
 

00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:44.453
Because in 1784,
despite the fact that Congress

00:28:44.453 --> 00:28:46.858
had supposedly decided the
issue,

00:28:46.858 --> 00:28:50.597
Pennsylvania sent someone to
New York to investigate the

00:28:50.597 --> 00:28:52.656
issue,
and this is the letter of

00:28:52.656 --> 00:28:56.189
introduction sent to introduce
this Pennsylvanian agent to New

00:28:56.189 --> 00:28:57.288
York's governor.
 

00:28:57.288 --> 00:29:00.683
Quote: "it becomes our
Duty to be prepared in the best

00:29:00.683 --> 00:29:03.643
manner we can,
for opposing attempts that

00:29:03.643 --> 00:29:06.040
threaten the Honor,
the Peace &amp;

00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:07.990
the wellfare of
Pennsylvania."

00:29:07.990 --> 00:29:08.227
Okay.
 

00:29:08.227 --> 00:29:10.028
This is a vaguely threatening
letter.

00:29:10.028 --> 00:29:12.640
So Congress has done what it
thinks it's supposed to do,

00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:14.348
but it has no power to enforce
it.

00:29:14.348 --> 00:29:16.473
It's just said,
'Yeah, we think the boundary is

00:29:16.473 --> 00:29:18.229
here,' and Pennsylvania
basically says,

00:29:18.229 --> 00:29:19.430
'We don't really care.
 

00:29:19.430 --> 00:29:22.709
We're going to go to New York
and fight it out with them and

00:29:22.709 --> 00:29:24.710
figure out where the boundary
is.'

00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:28.028
So here it's almost as though
Congress has not acted.

00:29:28.028 --> 00:29:30.058
Their ruling is almost
irrelevant here.

00:29:30.058 --> 00:29:33.478
So clearly we're seeing some of
the problems inherent in

00:29:33.478 --> 00:29:36.710
Congress just not being able to
enforce decisions.

00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:40.558
With no central control of
finance,

00:29:40.558 --> 00:29:44.390
no effective way for Congress
to overcome state rivalries,

00:29:44.390 --> 00:29:47.607
interstate commerce,
all these things are sort of

00:29:47.607 --> 00:29:48.480
brewing up.
 

00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:52.722
Logically, interstate commerce
between states becomes a big

00:29:52.722 --> 00:29:54.259
issue in the 1780s.
 

00:29:54.259 --> 00:29:56.130
I'm not going to go into it in
great detail here,

00:29:56.130 --> 00:29:59.988
but we will be seeing soon that
ultimately it's problems of

00:29:59.988 --> 00:30:03.381
interstate trade and
complications between dozens of

00:30:03.381 --> 00:30:07.239
separate sort of systems set up
between different states to

00:30:07.239 --> 00:30:11.097
trade that ultimately really
helps lead to what becomes the

00:30:11.097 --> 00:30:13.358
Constitutional Convention.
 

00:30:13.358 --> 00:30:16.586
Again, things that are sort
of--You can hearken right back

00:30:16.586 --> 00:30:17.720
to the Revolution.
 

00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:20.298
People are worried about
shipping and control of

00:30:20.298 --> 00:30:22.769
shipping, customs duties,
control of trade.

00:30:22.769 --> 00:30:26.036
It makes sense that states
would be feeling sensitive about

00:30:26.036 --> 00:30:29.247
surrendering any control for
those sorts of things to some

00:30:29.247 --> 00:30:31.048
kind of a centralized power.
 

00:30:31.048 --> 00:30:34.006
So again, logically enough
that's going to continue to be

00:30:34.006 --> 00:30:36.017
an issue,
and ultimately becomes a big

00:30:36.017 --> 00:30:39.066
enough issue that it leads to a
series of steps that gets us to

00:30:39.066 --> 00:30:40.690
the Constitutional Convention.
 

00:30:40.690 --> 00:30:41.012
Okay.
 

00:30:41.012 --> 00:30:44.760
So we've seen so far a little
cluster of different kinds of

00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:48.509
problems affiliated with the
Articles of Confederation.

00:30:48.509 --> 00:30:51.890
Many of these came into play in
what was essentially--

00:30:51.890 --> 00:30:54.104
for many at the time at
least--a low point for the

00:30:54.104 --> 00:30:57.865
Confederation Congress,
that took place in September of

00:30:57.865 --> 00:31:00.328
1786,
and that's Shays' Rebellion.

00:31:00.328 --> 00:31:03.989
It's a controversy that ended
up being a great PR tool for

00:31:03.989 --> 00:31:08.034
extreme nationalists who really
wanted to reform the Articles of

00:31:08.034 --> 00:31:09.190
Confederation.
 

00:31:09.190 --> 00:31:12.984
In September of 1786,
farmers in Massachusetts began

00:31:12.984 --> 00:31:17.525
to protest about the fact that
their property was being seized

00:31:17.525 --> 00:31:22.138
because they were unable to pay
off their debts and were unable

00:31:22.138 --> 00:31:24.000
to pay state taxes.
 

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:25.982
And at first,
many of these Massachusetts

00:31:25.982 --> 00:31:28.265
farmers protested in kind of a
traditional way,

00:31:28.265 --> 00:31:30.099
and we've seen these ways
before.

00:31:30.099 --> 00:31:31.848
They wrote petitions.
 

00:31:31.848 --> 00:31:34.498
Then when they didn't feel like
their petitions were being

00:31:34.498 --> 00:31:37.380
listened to, they staged sort of
ritualistic demonstrations.

00:31:37.380 --> 00:31:40.642
When these didn't work,
however, the farmers began to

00:31:40.642 --> 00:31:44.405
murmur that their petitions were
not being respected by their

00:31:44.405 --> 00:31:46.904
government,
that they were being forced

00:31:46.904 --> 00:31:49.119
against their will to pay unfair
taxes.

00:31:49.119 --> 00:31:50.118
Sound familiar?
 

00:31:50.118 --> 00:31:50.435
Right?
 

00:31:50.435 --> 00:31:53.500
These are Revolution-era
complaints that are coming back;

00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:56.680
it just happens to be against
the government of Massachusetts.

00:31:56.680 --> 00:31:58.750
So here you see people in
Massachusetts--

00:31:58.750 --> 00:32:01.634
these farmers--are making a
pretty strong statement about

00:32:01.634 --> 00:32:04.932
how they think government should
work and about the importance of

00:32:04.932 --> 00:32:06.170
popular sovereignty.
 

00:32:06.170 --> 00:32:09.818
So feeling that they're being
repressed and disrespected--

00:32:09.818 --> 00:32:11.920
their liberty is under attack,
their property under attack,

00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:13.750
their political voice being
ignored--

00:32:13.750 --> 00:32:17.890
these farmers began to take
more drastic action.

00:32:17.890 --> 00:32:21.267
Now, a large number of these
protestors were led by a

00:32:21.267 --> 00:32:24.318
revolutionary war officer named
Daniel Shays.

00:32:24.318 --> 00:32:28.497
And Daniel Shays actually was
followed by roughly 1,100

00:32:28.497 --> 00:32:30.200
debt-ridden farmers.
 

00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:33.402
Shays and his followers
criticized their creditors and

00:32:33.402 --> 00:32:37.087
merchants in general as a rising
aristocracy bent on depriving

00:32:37.087 --> 00:32:38.779
them of their liberties.
 

00:32:38.779 --> 00:32:43.305
They marched on the courts of
Massachusetts and ultimately

00:32:43.305 --> 00:32:47.990
closed them, demanding that the
state legislature respond to

00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:49.420
their demands.
 

00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:53.175
In response to these
actions--these upset farmers

00:32:53.175 --> 00:32:57.055
closing down the courts--
the Confederation Congress

00:32:57.055 --> 00:33:00.721
called out 800 Massachusetts
militiamen to suppress the

00:33:00.721 --> 00:33:01.400
revolt.
 

00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:03.926
The problem is,
the militia refused to act

00:33:03.926 --> 00:33:06.640
because they sympathized with
the farmers.

00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:09.528
Okay, bad plan, didn't work.
 

00:33:09.528 --> 00:33:12.717
So now the local militia is
entirely disregarding a request

00:33:12.717 --> 00:33:15.684
for national defense from what's
acting as the national

00:33:15.684 --> 00:33:17.170
government at the time.
 

00:33:17.170 --> 00:33:20.794
Congress next responded by
requesting roughly half a

00:33:20.794 --> 00:33:25.201
million dollars from the states
to raise a special force of men

00:33:25.201 --> 00:33:27.118
to crush the rebellion.
 

00:33:27.118 --> 00:33:31.680
And only Virginia responded,
little Virginia.

00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:32.078
'Okay.
 

00:33:32.078 --> 00:33:34.544
[laughs]
We'll contribute a little bit

00:33:34.544 --> 00:33:35.410
of money.'
 

00:33:35.410 --> 00:33:36.808
No one else responded.
 

00:33:36.808 --> 00:33:37.182
Okay.
 

00:33:37.182 --> 00:33:41.500
Congress could not even raise
money to suppress an internal

00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:42.470
rebellion.
 

00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:45.195
So New England is moving into
becoming up in arms,

00:33:45.195 --> 00:33:48.588
and Congress is trying twice
now to do something and can't.

00:33:48.588 --> 00:33:52.401
In the end, a number of the
established elite in

00:33:52.401 --> 00:33:55.176
Massachusetts--
lawyers, particularly

00:33:55.176 --> 00:33:59.038
merchants, wealthy merchants--
were forced to come up with

00:33:59.038 --> 00:34:00.368
their own solution.
 

00:34:00.368 --> 00:34:03.390
So many of the wealthiest
merchants in Massachusetts,

00:34:03.390 --> 00:34:07.009
and some of these lawyers,
raised their own money and

00:34:07.009 --> 00:34:11.048
created their own private army
to suppress the rebellion of

00:34:11.048 --> 00:34:12.789
several thousand men.
 

00:34:12.789 --> 00:34:17.389
So they funded their own army
to suppress the rebellion.

00:34:17.389 --> 00:34:22.380
Now, with the history of the
Revolution as hindsight,

00:34:22.380 --> 00:34:25.112
what do you think would happen
when these rebellious farmers

00:34:25.112 --> 00:34:27.614
feel that a hostile army is
descending on them to steal

00:34:27.614 --> 00:34:29.340
their liberties and crush--
[laughter]

00:34:29.340 --> 00:34:29.514
Right?
 

00:34:29.514 --> 00:34:30.268
You're already laughing.
 

00:34:30.268 --> 00:34:33.005
It's like--yeah,
they're going to just fold and

00:34:33.005 --> 00:34:33.599
go home.
 

00:34:33.599 --> 00:34:33.831
No.
 

00:34:33.831 --> 00:34:36.768
[laughs]
They became more rebellious.

00:34:36.768 --> 00:34:37.139
Right?
 

00:34:37.139 --> 00:34:40.351
Now they're staging guerrilla
raids against prominent

00:34:40.351 --> 00:34:43.934
merchants and office holders,
trying to overthrow what they

00:34:43.934 --> 00:34:46.489
saw as the oppressive government
of the state,

00:34:46.489 --> 00:34:49.485
and ultimately there were
several battles between the

00:34:49.485 --> 00:34:52.079
private army and the
Massachusetts farmers.

00:34:52.079 --> 00:34:55.302
About fifty of the farmers were
wounded or killed,

00:34:55.302 --> 00:34:59.050
a few dozen of the private
armed force men were wounded or

00:34:59.050 --> 00:35:00.300
killed as well.
 

00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:05.382
And all of this trouble ended
in roughly 1787 when an economic

00:35:05.382 --> 00:35:10.050
upturn made some of the farmers'
debts easier to pay,

00:35:10.050 --> 00:35:12.494
and many of the farmers began
to see that surrounding states

00:35:12.494 --> 00:35:14.980
were not particularly thrilled
with the idea of Massachusetts

00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:15.849
going up in arms.
 

00:35:15.849 --> 00:35:19.278
So some of these farmers fled,
rather than face whatever they

00:35:19.278 --> 00:35:21.280
feared the consequences might
be.

00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:24.670
They went some of them to the
north, some of them to the west.

00:35:24.670 --> 00:35:27.070
This is my favorite random
factoid about Shays' Rebellion.

00:35:27.070 --> 00:35:29.039
Guess where Daniel Shays went?
 

00:35:29.039 --> 00:35:30.610
He fled Massachusetts.
 

00:35:30.610 --> 00:35:33.340
He went to the independent
republic of Vermont.

00:35:33.340 --> 00:35:35.835
[laughter]
If I were writing the story,

00:35:35.835 --> 00:35:40.170
I would have made him go to the
independent republic of Vermont.

00:35:40.170 --> 00:35:40.650
Okay.
 

00:35:40.650 --> 00:35:44.880
So Shays' Rebellion shook a lot
of people,

00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:48.666
but it was really upsetting to
people who had doubts about the

00:35:48.666 --> 00:35:52.268
powers of the Confederation
government because it seemed to

00:35:52.268 --> 00:35:56.054
throw a really harsh light on
the Congress and how defenseless

00:35:56.054 --> 00:35:57.980
it was to maintain order.
 

00:35:57.980 --> 00:36:01.380
And this was not the only
uprising or the only potential

00:36:01.380 --> 00:36:04.534
uprising even in this period
that particularly these

00:36:04.534 --> 00:36:06.760
nationalists found so upsetting.
 

00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:08.469
I'm going to mention only two
here--

00:36:08.469 --> 00:36:12.349
two potential military
uprisings--and in this case,

00:36:12.349 --> 00:36:15.449
both of these took place as the
Continental Army was beginning

00:36:15.449 --> 00:36:16.110
to disband.
 

00:36:16.110 --> 00:36:19.244
One of them ends up becoming
known as the Newburgh Conspiracy

00:36:19.244 --> 00:36:21.699
because it takes place in
Newburgh, New York.

00:36:21.699 --> 00:36:24.525
And the Newburgh Conspiracy
consisted of a group of

00:36:24.525 --> 00:36:27.519
disgruntled Army officers who
got tired of waiting for

00:36:27.519 --> 00:36:29.949
Congress to grant them their
pensions--

00:36:29.949 --> 00:36:33.050
because of course Congress has
no way to grant them their

00:36:33.050 --> 00:36:33.659
pensions.
 

00:36:33.659 --> 00:36:37.152
So in 1783 they formed a plan
that they would refuse to

00:36:37.152 --> 00:36:41.099
disband as an army unless they
were granted their pensions.

00:36:41.099 --> 00:36:45.101
So there's the vague threat of
a coup basically from this group

00:36:45.101 --> 00:36:46.780
of officers in Newburgh.
 

00:36:46.780 --> 00:36:49.713
'We're going to stay here and
we're going to remain a little

00:36:49.713 --> 00:36:52.349
army unless you give us our
pensions and if you don't,

00:36:52.349 --> 00:36:53.989
then we'll see what happens.'
 

00:36:53.989 --> 00:36:54.280
Okay.
 

00:36:54.280 --> 00:36:56.019
What ultimately stopped this?
 

00:36:56.019 --> 00:36:57.639
Again not the Congress.
 

00:36:57.639 --> 00:37:00.469
George Washington,
a little George Washington

00:37:00.469 --> 00:37:01.050
moment.
 

00:37:01.050 --> 00:37:03.331
George Washington personally
stopped the Newburgh Conspiracy,

00:37:03.331 --> 00:37:05.500
and this shows you the real
power of George Washington.

00:37:05.500 --> 00:37:06.619
He goes to Newburgh.
 

00:37:06.619 --> 00:37:07.789
It's like: 'Oh, boy.
 

00:37:07.789 --> 00:37:09.840
I've got to go deal with the
officers at Newburgh.

00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:11.010
This is looking ugly.'
 

00:37:11.010 --> 00:37:14.190
He goes in person and he stands
up to address the assembled

00:37:14.190 --> 00:37:17.534
officers who are getting ready
to potentially stage a coup and

00:37:17.534 --> 00:37:21.614
he's trying to plead with them,
'please don't do this,

00:37:21.614 --> 00:37:24.739
this is not in--
for the good of the country.'

00:37:24.739 --> 00:37:27.420
But before he even really has a
chance to argue anything,

00:37:27.420 --> 00:37:30.643
he reaches in his pocket to get
out his glasses so that he can

00:37:30.643 --> 00:37:33.179
read something that he's written
and he says--

00:37:33.179 --> 00:37:35.846
as he is great--another example
of great sort of theater on the

00:37:35.846 --> 00:37:37.050
part of George Washington.
 

00:37:37.050 --> 00:37:40.030
He takes the glasses out and as
he puts them on he says,

00:37:40.030 --> 00:37:42.809
'Excuse me, gentlemen,
but I've grown not only gray

00:37:42.809 --> 00:37:46.257
but blind in the service of my
country,' and the officers start

00:37:46.257 --> 00:37:46.869
to cry.
 

00:37:46.869 --> 00:37:49.320
[laughter] 'Oh.
 

00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:52.050
[laughs] We're sorry.'
 

00:37:52.050 --> 00:37:54.829
[laughs]
End of Newburgh Conspiracy.

00:37:54.829 --> 00:37:57.039
[laughter]
It was just the magic of George

00:37:57.039 --> 00:37:58.280
Washington's glasses.
 

00:37:58.280 --> 00:37:59.289
That was it.
 

00:37:59.289 --> 00:38:01.659
The man knew how to stage a
moment.

00:38:01.659 --> 00:38:01.929
Okay.
 

00:38:01.929 --> 00:38:04.739
So that does actually fold the
Newburgh Conspiracy.

00:38:04.739 --> 00:38:09.351
There is another sort of mini,
semi-revolt that takes place in

00:38:09.351 --> 00:38:12.300
1783 involving Pennsylvania
soldiers.

00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:15.659
Congress disbands this
particular group of Pennsylvania

00:38:15.659 --> 00:38:19.268
soldiers in 1783 and sends them
home with no payment of any

00:38:19.268 --> 00:38:19.829
kind.
 

00:38:19.829 --> 00:38:20.110
'Sorry.
 

00:38:20.110 --> 00:38:21.230
We can't pay you right now.
 

00:38:21.230 --> 00:38:22.739
We'll get back to you.'
 

00:38:22.739 --> 00:38:22.971
Okay.
 

00:38:22.971 --> 00:38:25.190
This does not thrill these
particular soldiers.

00:38:25.190 --> 00:38:26.969
They hear that they've been
dismissed from the Army.

00:38:26.969 --> 00:38:29.400
They hear that nothing's going
to get done about their pay.

00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:32.998
A few hundred of them marched
to Philadelphia and barricaded

00:38:32.998 --> 00:38:36.659
members of the Confederation
Congress in the state house,

00:38:36.659 --> 00:38:39.233
sticking their bayonets through
the windows and making

00:38:39.233 --> 00:38:40.349
threatening gestures.
 

00:38:40.349 --> 00:38:42.989
[laughter] 'Pay us, now.'
 

00:38:42.989 --> 00:38:43.929
[laughs] Okay.
 

00:38:43.929 --> 00:38:46.809
So this was not thrilling to
the Confederation Congress.

00:38:46.809 --> 00:38:48.849
There was kind of a standoff
where there's armed guys with

00:38:48.849 --> 00:38:50.280
bayonets surrounding the state
house,

00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:53.032
and Confederation Congressmen
in the state house not knowing

00:38:53.032 --> 00:38:53.639
what to do.
 

00:38:53.639 --> 00:38:57.672
This sort of sputters to a
close when several Congressmen

00:38:57.672 --> 00:39:02.210
walked outside and just left and
no one did anything to them.

00:39:02.210 --> 00:39:04.378
They were just like:
'bye,'--and everyone realized

00:39:04.378 --> 00:39:06.900
okay, these guys actually really
don't want to hurt us;

00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:08.730
they're just making a point.
 

00:39:08.730 --> 00:39:11.806
End of semi-coup,
slash, rebellion in

00:39:11.806 --> 00:39:13.090
Pennsylvania.
 

00:39:13.090 --> 00:39:15.693
However, Congress was so thrown
by this that they decided

00:39:15.693 --> 00:39:18.389
Princeton might be a better
place to meet from then on,

00:39:18.389 --> 00:39:20.030
and so they temporarily moved
to Princeton,

00:39:20.030 --> 00:39:22.590
New Jersey, rather than stay in
Philadelphia because

00:39:22.590 --> 00:39:24.449
Philadelphia had just become
scary.

00:39:24.449 --> 00:39:28.242
It's worth mentioning--I should
actually mention that both of

00:39:28.242 --> 00:39:31.907
these events really strongly
reinforced the prevailing Whig

00:39:31.907 --> 00:39:33.929
distrust of standing armies.
 

00:39:33.929 --> 00:39:34.193
Right?
 

00:39:34.193 --> 00:39:36.708
Look at what happens when you
have a standing army sitting

00:39:36.708 --> 00:39:37.150
around.
 

00:39:37.150 --> 00:39:39.706
They can't help themselves;
they're always threatening to

00:39:39.706 --> 00:39:40.489
overturn the government.
 

00:39:40.489 --> 00:39:44.159
So this reinforces fears of
standing armies for certain--for

00:39:44.159 --> 00:39:45.280
a while to come.
 

00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:48.867
But certainly all of these
incidents are really fueling the

00:39:48.867 --> 00:39:52.331
fears and the anxieties and the
concerns of these extreme

00:39:52.331 --> 00:39:55.920
nationalists who already are
feeling that these Articles of

00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:58.579
Confederation are not strong
enough,

00:39:58.579 --> 00:40:02.039
and now look what's happening
as the 1780s are unfolding.

00:40:02.039 --> 00:40:04.920
As Alexander Hamilton would
write in The Federalist No.

00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:07.699
21--and again he's writing
in The Federalist,

00:40:07.699 --> 00:40:09.829
which means he really wants
to make a point--

00:40:09.829 --> 00:40:13.213
he wrote: "Who can
determine what might have been

00:40:13.213 --> 00:40:15.960
the issue of Massachusetts'
convulsions,

00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:18.827
if the malcontents had been
headed by a Caesar or a

00:40:18.827 --> 00:40:19.460
Cromwell?
 

00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:22.360
Who can predict what effect a
despotism,

00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:25.827
established in Massachusetts,
would have upon the liberties

00:40:25.827 --> 00:40:27.980
of New Hampshire or Rhode
Island,

00:40:27.980 --> 00:40:30.869
of Connecticut or New
York?"

00:40:30.869 --> 00:40:34.329
The problem to men like
Hamilton and other really strong

00:40:34.329 --> 00:40:38.293
nationalists was that Americans
seemed to be so focused on their

00:40:38.293 --> 00:40:40.869
individual interests,
on their states,

00:40:40.869 --> 00:40:43.101
on their homes,
that they had seemingly

00:40:43.101 --> 00:40:46.449
forgotten how to think about
themselves as Americans,

00:40:46.449 --> 00:40:48.800
as a united people.
 

00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:52.076
This concept would be at the
core of the debate over the

00:40:52.076 --> 00:40:52.969
Constitution.
 

00:40:52.969 --> 00:40:56.942
Would it be possible--if
somehow the states could agree

00:40:56.942 --> 00:41:00.472
that it was necessary to
strengthen their central

00:41:00.472 --> 00:41:03.135
government--
to devise some kind of

00:41:03.135 --> 00:41:07.123
government that would actually
be acceptable to all thirteen

00:41:07.123 --> 00:41:07.800
states?
 

00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:10.130
Were there enough common bonds?
 

00:41:10.130 --> 00:41:14.230
Could Americans only be defined
when pitted against enemies?

00:41:14.230 --> 00:41:16.840
Was there no American identity
in and of itself,

00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:19.896
and was it enough to really
hold people together in some

00:41:19.896 --> 00:41:21.619
kind of unified government?
 

00:41:21.619 --> 00:41:25.771
And during the battle to ratify
the Constitution in 1788,

00:41:25.771 --> 00:41:28.590
Hamilton stated just that very
fact.

00:41:28.590 --> 00:41:31.726
He said the real question was
about who and what were

00:41:31.726 --> 00:41:32.449
Americans.
 

00:41:32.449 --> 00:41:35.530
Speaking to the New York
ratifying convention,

00:41:35.530 --> 00:41:37.449
he said, "It has been
asserted,

00:41:37.449 --> 00:41:39.922
that the interests,
habits and manners of the

00:41:39.922 --> 00:41:43.090
Thirteen States are different;
and hence it is inferred,

00:41:43.090 --> 00:41:45.670
that no general free government
can suit them.

00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:47.480
This diversity of habits ...
 

00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:50.282
has been a favorite theme with
those who are disposed for a

00:41:50.282 --> 00:41:52.987
division of our empire;
and, like many other popular

00:41:52.987 --> 00:41:55.340
objections, seems to be founded
on fallacy.

00:41:55.340 --> 00:41:57.518
I acknowledge,
that the local interests of the

00:41:57.518 --> 00:41:59.697
states are in some degree
various"--Yeah,

00:41:59.697 --> 00:42:00.230
thanks.
 

00:42:00.230 --> 00:42:03.092
I guess so--"and that
there is some difference in

00:42:03.092 --> 00:42:05.846
their manners and habits:
But this I will presume to

00:42:05.846 --> 00:42:07.387
affirm;
that, from New Hampshire to

00:42:07.387 --> 00:42:09.148
Georgia,
the people of America are as

00:42:09.148 --> 00:42:11.210
uniform in their interests and
manners,

00:42:11.210 --> 00:42:14.340
as those of any country
established in Europe."

00:42:14.340 --> 00:42:18.690
So basically Hamilton's
arguing: we are a common people.

00:42:18.690 --> 00:42:22.130
When you compare us with
Europe, look at all of the

00:42:22.130 --> 00:42:23.920
similarities between us.
 

00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:27.853
And we need a common government
to join us, an American

00:42:27.853 --> 00:42:28.800
government.
 

00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:32.855
This is really the theme of the
nationalists who took the lead

00:42:32.855 --> 00:42:36.909
in moving the nation towards the
Constitutional Convention.

00:42:36.909 --> 00:42:39.085
Now before I conclude this
lecture, I do want to mention

00:42:39.085 --> 00:42:39.559
one thing.
 

00:42:39.559 --> 00:42:42.181
I was going to mention it a
little earlier when I was

00:42:42.181 --> 00:42:44.449
talking about Shays' Rebellion
and forgot,

00:42:44.449 --> 00:42:46.266
but I can't resist adding it in
only because it's another little

00:42:46.266 --> 00:42:47.934
Yale moment,
and I'm always looking for Yale

00:42:47.934 --> 00:42:50.579
moments in the Revolution,
and this is another one.

00:42:50.579 --> 00:42:52.172
It's just a random little thing
that I found,

00:42:52.172 --> 00:42:53.440
but I thought it was
interesting.

00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:56.597
It makes me realize that to be
the President of Yale during the

00:42:56.597 --> 00:42:57.820
Revolution was no fun.
 

00:42:57.820 --> 00:42:58.139
Right.
 

00:42:58.139 --> 00:43:01.344
I think Ezra Stiles--This was
just--It couldn't have been fun

00:43:01.344 --> 00:43:02.360
for Ezra Stiles.
 

00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:05.871
This is actually from 17--early
in 1787 and what it--what I

00:43:05.871 --> 00:43:09.139
found was a letter from Stiles
to George Washington.

00:43:09.139 --> 00:43:12.639
And what the letter says is one
of my--

00:43:12.639 --> 00:43:14.440
actually two of my students or
one of my students--

00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:17.974
two of my students--okay,
two of my students just arrived

00:43:17.974 --> 00:43:21.965
here from Massachusetts,
and they were caught by Shays'

00:43:21.965 --> 00:43:25.090
rebels who kept them there for a
while,

00:43:25.090 --> 00:43:29.550
but the students spied and they
saw how many men they were.

00:43:29.550 --> 00:43:31.400
Basically, these two Yale
students are on their way from

00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:34.268
Massachusetts here,
and they get caught by Shays'

00:43:34.268 --> 00:43:35.896
rebels,
and while they're there,

00:43:35.896 --> 00:43:38.351
they try and scope things out
and then they come back and they

00:43:38.351 --> 00:43:39.679
report to Stiles like:
'okay,

00:43:39.679 --> 00:43:41.050
there's roughly 2,500 men.'
 

00:43:41.050 --> 00:43:43.110
They become little war
strategists.

00:43:43.110 --> 00:43:45.648
And Stiles writes to George
Washington and says:

00:43:45.648 --> 00:43:46.079
'Okay.
 

00:43:46.079 --> 00:43:48.300
Let me give you the update on
the Shays' rebels.'

00:43:48.300 --> 00:43:51.016
And he has this whole letter
with numbers and he draws a

00:43:51.016 --> 00:43:53.340
little map: 'here's where I
think they are'--

00:43:53.340 --> 00:43:56.014
all from these Yale students
who got captured by Shays'

00:43:56.014 --> 00:43:56.460
rebels.
 

00:43:56.460 --> 00:43:59.489
I love that letter because it
means Shays' Rebellion is not

00:43:59.489 --> 00:44:01.204
something that--
everyone knows about Shays'

00:44:01.204 --> 00:44:02.755
Rebellion,
but the Yale connection with

00:44:02.755 --> 00:44:03.530
Shays' Rebellion?
 

00:44:03.530 --> 00:44:06.896
That was news to me,
and the fact that this

00:44:06.896 --> 00:44:10.612
particular one guy who--
student who estimates how many

00:44:10.612 --> 00:44:13.432
troops were there--
Stiles calls him "a young

00:44:13.432 --> 00:44:16.380
gentleman of solidity and good
information"--

00:44:16.380 --> 00:44:19.469
he's the guy who I guess did
counting and estimating.

00:44:19.469 --> 00:44:22.556
So there were Yale students
informing George Washington

00:44:22.556 --> 00:44:25.815
about the nature of Shays'
Rebellion and how many men were

00:44:25.815 --> 00:44:26.559
involved.
 

00:44:26.559 --> 00:44:29.197
The last thing that I'll
mention before we run out of

00:44:29.197 --> 00:44:32.239
time here again was another
random document that I found,

00:44:32.239 --> 00:44:35.347
but I thought it was
interesting because I think we

00:44:35.347 --> 00:44:38.766
tend to think of the Shays'
rebels as crazy farmers with

00:44:38.766 --> 00:44:39.699
pitchforks.
 

00:44:39.699 --> 00:44:42.260
'I hate taxes!'
 

00:44:42.260 --> 00:44:45.159
And the fact is,
these actually were people with

00:44:45.159 --> 00:44:46.579
principles and ideas.
 

00:44:46.579 --> 00:44:49.286
They happened to be protesting,
but they weren't crazy people

00:44:49.286 --> 00:44:50.099
with pitchforks.
 

00:44:50.099 --> 00:44:53.559
And what I found was one of the
generals,

00:44:53.559 --> 00:44:55.900
one of the people sort of
leading the rebels,

00:44:55.900 --> 00:45:01.411
wrote a statement to
Massachusetts basically asking

00:45:01.411 --> 00:45:05.599
them to eliminate the private
army--

00:45:05.599 --> 00:45:08.862
but I wanted to read it to you
because it gives you a sense of

00:45:08.862 --> 00:45:11.965
some of the rationale and the
feelings behind some of these

00:45:11.965 --> 00:45:12.929
Shays' rebels.
 

00:45:12.929 --> 00:45:16.148
It's dated January 25,1787:
"Head Quarters,

00:45:16.148 --> 00:45:17.860
West Springfield."
 

00:45:17.860 --> 00:45:20.172
Again, really gives you a sense
of how the rebels envision

00:45:20.172 --> 00:45:20.699
themselves.
 

00:45:20.699 --> 00:45:23.268
"The body of the people
assembled in arms"

00:45:23.268 --> 00:45:24.090
--
which is they

00:45:24.090 --> 00:45:26.952
themselves--"adhering to
the first principles of natural

00:45:26.952 --> 00:45:29.985
self-preservation,--
do, in the most peremptory

00:45:29.985 --> 00:45:31.400
manner, demand ...
 

00:45:31.400 --> 00:45:33.929
That the troops in Springfield
lay down their arms ...

00:45:33.929 --> 00:45:36.840
That their arms be deposited in
the public stores,

00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:38.710
under the care of the proper
officers,

00:45:38.710 --> 00:45:40.978
to be returned to the owners at
the termination of the present

00:45:40.978 --> 00:45:41.500
contests ...
 

00:45:41.500 --> 00:45:45.090
That the troops return to their
homes upon parole."

00:45:45.090 --> 00:45:47.755
Signed, "Luke Day,
Captain Commandant of this

00:45:47.755 --> 00:45:48.679
division."
 

00:45:48.679 --> 00:45:49.003
Okay.
 

00:45:49.003 --> 00:45:50.880
That's by one of the rebels.
 

00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:53.797
So I read that only because it
kind of gets us past the crazy

00:45:53.797 --> 00:45:55.550
farmer guys with pitchfork
image--

00:45:55.550 --> 00:45:58.630
that these were people really
who had a sense of principle,

00:45:58.630 --> 00:46:01.052
and again a principle you can
just hear in the language that I

00:46:01.052 --> 00:46:03.166
read there,
inspired and driven by the

00:46:03.166 --> 00:46:05.800
Revolution that they had just
been through.

00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:08.480
In their mind it's all part of
the same fight,

00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:11.010
but you can hear,
just in that language,

00:46:11.010 --> 00:46:13.728
if people are associating
what's happening in the 1780s to

00:46:13.728 --> 00:46:16.739
what happened in the Revolution,
and if the Revolution is the

00:46:16.739 --> 00:46:20.045
story of government overturned,
again, you can see why these

00:46:20.045 --> 00:46:23.682
nationalists would have been so
disconcerted and so upset by

00:46:23.682 --> 00:46:26.150
what they saw unfolding in the
1780s.

00:46:26.150 --> 00:46:26.451
Right?
 

00:46:26.451 --> 00:46:29.411
They'd already seen a pretty
major government get overturned

00:46:29.411 --> 00:46:31.920
with this kind of action during
the Revolution.

00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:35.043
Now we've instituted this
government and we see some of

00:46:35.043 --> 00:46:37.590
the same kind of behavior
happening again.

00:46:37.590 --> 00:46:40.695
So what we're going to hear in
the next couple of lectures is

00:46:40.695 --> 00:46:42.820
people discussing what needs to
happen.

00:46:42.820 --> 00:46:45.590
Not everybody thinks that this
is the sign of a horrible,

00:46:45.590 --> 00:46:48.123
horrendous crisis but,
boy, the people who really felt

00:46:48.123 --> 00:46:50.751
that the Articles was a
problematic government were very

00:46:50.751 --> 00:46:53.012
loud,
and over time they become very

00:46:53.012 --> 00:46:56.461
united in thinking that there's
a serious problem about the

00:46:56.461 --> 00:46:58.960
center of government in the new
nation.

00:46:58.960 --> 00:47:00.139
I will stop there.
 

00:47:00.139 --> 00:47:03.360
I will see you on Tuesday.
 

00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:04.420
Have a good weekend.
 

00:47:04.420 --> 00:47:10.000

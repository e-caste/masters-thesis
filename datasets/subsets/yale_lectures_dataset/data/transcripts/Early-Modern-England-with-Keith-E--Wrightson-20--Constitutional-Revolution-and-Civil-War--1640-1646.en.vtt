00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:05.623
Prof: The great
political philosopher Thomas

00:00:05.623 --> 00:00:08.235
Hobbes--
who, if you haven't read you

00:00:08.235 --> 00:00:12.187
will be learning something about
in the section reading this

00:00:12.187 --> 00:00:15.156
week--
Thomas Hobbes formulated his

00:00:15.156 --> 00:00:20.143
theory of the state and his
ideas on political obligation in

00:00:20.143 --> 00:00:25.045
the context of the civil wars
which tore apart all three of

00:00:25.045 --> 00:00:29.610
the constituent kingdoms of
Britain in the 1640s.

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:34.238
And when it was all over
Hobbes, who had returned from

00:00:34.238 --> 00:00:38.768
exile in the 1650s,
wrote a history of the conflict

00:00:38.768 --> 00:00:43.960
which he called Behemoth,
published in 1662.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.510
The title's up here.
 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.880
And he began it with this
wonderful sentence,

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.000
the first sentence of
Behemoth: "If in

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.783
time,
as in place,

00:00:55.783 --> 00:00:59.710
there were degrees of high and
low,

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.350
I verily believe that the
highest of times would be that

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.980
which passed betwixt 1640 and
1660."

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:13.054
And what Hobbes meant by that
striking sentence was that the

00:01:13.054 --> 00:01:17.784
events of those two decades
unleashed consequences of an

00:01:17.784 --> 00:01:22.860
enormously far-reaching nature:
in politics of course,

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.799
in religion,
and also in the realm of ideas.

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:31.459
Things would never be quite the
same again.

00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:36.126
But if that's how it looked to
Hobbes at the end of the whole

00:01:36.126 --> 00:01:40.250
process, in the beginning,
in 1637, none of that could

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.040
really be foreseen.
 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:47.641
In 1637, Charles I's experiment
in personal rule was going well

00:01:47.641 --> 00:01:52.519
and he had just succeeded in
winning legal backing,

00:01:52.519 --> 00:01:55.840
albeit narrowly,
for the continued collection of

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:01.530
Ship Money,
an annual non-parliamentary tax.

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.290
But Charles' relative success
depended upon two things.

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.167
First of all,
he needed to avoid unnecessary

00:02:09.167 --> 00:02:15.120
expense, especially the kind of
expenditure necessitated by war.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.561
Part of the reason for his
success in the 1630s was that he

00:02:18.561 --> 00:02:20.460
had kept the kingdom at peace.
 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:24.949
Secondly, he needed to avoid
calling a parliament.

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:29.313
He needed to avoid a parliament
which would be a forum for

00:02:29.313 --> 00:02:34.214
deeply alienated elements of the
political nation who loathed his

00:02:34.214 --> 00:02:37.199
fiscal expedients on the one
hand,

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:42.740
and on the other hand his
Arminian policy in the church.

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:46.110
He needed time for such
opposition to die down;

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.470
if it would.
 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:53.020
And in 1638 to '40 all of this
collapsed.

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:56.520
As I mentioned at the end of
the last lecture,

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.729
in 1637 Charles and Archbishop
William Laud overreached

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:05.094
themselves by attempting to
impose uniformity on religion

00:03:05.094 --> 00:03:09.849
throughout not only England but
also Charles' other kingdom of

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:11.020
Scotland.
 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:16.042
They attempted to impose
episcopacy and an Anglican-style

00:03:16.042 --> 00:03:19.810
prayer book upon the Church of
Scotland.

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.209
In 1638, the Scots,
led by many of their leading

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:27.259
nobility and backed by the
General Assembly of the Church

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:31.063
of Scotland,
formed in Edinburgh a National

00:03:31.063 --> 00:03:35.955
Covenant taken by all the
leaders of the movement and many

00:03:35.955 --> 00:03:41.188
others to resist innovations in
religion and they proceeded to

00:03:41.188 --> 00:03:42.818
raise an army.
 

00:03:42.818 --> 00:03:46.251
In 1639, Charles proved
incapable of finding the

00:03:46.251 --> 00:03:50.485
resources to put an effective
army in the field to stop the

00:03:50.485 --> 00:03:54.647
Scottish rebellion and the
Covenanters effectively overran

00:03:54.647 --> 00:03:57.348
the whole of southern Scotland.
 

00:03:57.348 --> 00:04:00.550
It was completely in their
control.

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:05.990
In desperate need of funds,
the King was forced to call a

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:09.905
parliament,
and in 1640 the writs went out

00:04:09.905 --> 00:04:14.250
for what came to be known as the
Short Parliament.

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:19.035
The elections which were held
in that year were unusually

00:04:19.035 --> 00:04:19.889
fraught.
 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:22.880
Customarily,
in most counties or urban

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.410
constituencies election contests
were relatively rare.

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:31.211
Usually, people somehow by
consensus managed to decide who

00:04:31.211 --> 00:04:33.680
would represent them in
parliament.

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.161
In the elections for the Short
Parliament research has shown

00:04:37.161 --> 00:04:40.762
that in fact there were contests
in no fewer than a quarter of

00:04:40.762 --> 00:04:44.122
the constituencies,
a very high number for this

00:04:44.122 --> 00:04:46.692
period,
contests between candidates who

00:04:46.692 --> 00:04:48.990
were regarded by the electorate
as,

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:53.185
on the one hand,
'courtiers' and candidates who

00:04:53.185 --> 00:04:57.199
were regarded as having
'country' values,

00:04:57.199 --> 00:05:00.649
that is to say staunch
traditional Protestants,

00:05:00.649 --> 00:05:05.684
adherents to the rule of law,
supporters for parliament's

00:05:05.684 --> 00:05:09.550
continued place in the political
process.

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:13.423
When the Short Parliament met
late in April 1640 it

00:05:13.423 --> 00:05:17.375
immediately took up the old
tactic from the 1620s of

00:05:17.375 --> 00:05:21.250
agreeing that they would vote
the King money,

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:26.310
but only if their grievances
were first remedied,

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:29.639
and indeed the very first
speech made in the Short

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:33.105
Parliament in the House of
Commons declared that the

00:05:33.105 --> 00:05:37.184
Scottish rebels were less of a
threat to the kingdom than the

00:05:37.184 --> 00:05:40.786
threat which was posed by the
King's government to the

00:05:40.786 --> 00:05:43.029
liberties of the subject.
 

00:05:43.029 --> 00:05:48.976
Charles responded by dissolving
parliament after roughly three

00:05:48.976 --> 00:05:53.459
weeks: hence its name,
the Short Parliament.

00:05:53.459 --> 00:05:57.449
Charles then attempted to
prepare to invade Scotland with

00:05:57.449 --> 00:06:00.870
the very inadequate resources at
his disposal.

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:02.629
Troops were raised.
 

00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:05.329
They proceeded north amidst
great disorders.

00:06:05.329 --> 00:06:08.420
They were of low quality and
poorly trained.

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:12.752
And they were rapidly defeated
by a pre-emptive strike on the

00:06:12.752 --> 00:06:15.930
part of the Scots who crossed
the border,

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:19.884
drove back the royal troops,
and occupied the whole of the

00:06:19.884 --> 00:06:24.119
northeast of England including
the crucial strategic center of

00:06:24.119 --> 00:06:27.336
Newcastle,
center of the coal trade which

00:06:27.336 --> 00:06:30.528
supplied the fuel on which
London depended.

00:06:30.528 --> 00:06:34.990
So the whole of the northeast
of England was under Scottish

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:35.990
occupation.
 

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:39.855
They then settled down,
waiting for negotiations and

00:06:39.855 --> 00:06:44.478
taxing the counties which they'd
occupied in order to maintain

00:06:44.478 --> 00:06:46.069
their occupation.
 

00:06:46.069 --> 00:06:49.370
I should just mention the
sudden success of the Scots

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:51.339
should have been predictable.
 

00:06:51.339 --> 00:06:54.230
Many Scots had served as
mercenaries in the armies

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:57.653
particularly of Sweden and of
the Netherlands in the Thirty

00:06:57.653 --> 00:06:58.480
Years War.
 

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:01.050
They were very good experienced
soldiers.

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:03.600
They'd come home to defend the
Covenant.

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:06.997
They were led by David Leslie,
a general with a great deal of

00:07:06.997 --> 00:07:10.509
experience who had distinguished
himself in Swedish service.

00:07:10.509 --> 00:07:15.860
England had nothing comparable
militarily.

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:20.257
Well, humiliated and desperate,
Charles called another

00:07:20.257 --> 00:07:23.452
parliament,
this one to meet in November

00:07:23.452 --> 00:07:27.517
1640, and the whole country was
galvanized by this second

00:07:27.517 --> 00:07:28.389
election.
 

00:07:28.389 --> 00:07:30.589
There were even more election
contests.

00:07:30.589 --> 00:07:34.423
It's thought that about a third
of constituencies were contested

00:07:34.423 --> 00:07:37.040
in the elections for the Long
Parliament.

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:42.026
Indeed it's been suggested that
nationwide perhaps between a

00:07:42.026 --> 00:07:47.351
quarter and a third of all adult
males voted in the election for

00:07:47.351 --> 00:07:49.379
the Long Parliament.
 

00:07:49.379 --> 00:07:53.134
The members elected arrived in
Westminster bringing with them

00:07:53.134 --> 00:07:56.637
petitions from their counties
cataloging their grievances

00:07:56.637 --> 00:07:58.639
against Charles' government.
 

00:07:58.639 --> 00:08:02.250
There was a tremendous unity of
purpose amongst them.

00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:07.855
They knew that this time the
King could not afford to

00:08:07.855 --> 00:08:12.170
dissolve parliament if it
opposed him.

00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:16.540
When parliament met,
the initiative was immediately

00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:21.788
seized by John Pym who rapidly
emerged as leader in the House

00:08:21.788 --> 00:08:23.100
of Commons.
 

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:27.175
He was a veteran of the battles
in Parliament in the 1620s and

00:08:27.175 --> 00:08:29.379
knew exactly what he was doing.
 

00:08:29.379 --> 00:08:34.390
In an early speech he alleged
the existence of a plot to

00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:39.856
introduce popery and arbitrary
government emanating from some

00:08:39.856 --> 00:08:42.500
of the King's councilors.
 

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:46.184
Early in the meeting of
parliament in its first session

00:08:46.184 --> 00:08:50.349
in November 1640 this allegation
developed into direct attacks

00:08:50.349 --> 00:08:53.080
upon the King's leading
councilors,

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:56.870
Archbishop Laud and Thomas
Wentworth,

00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:58.320
the Earl of Strafford.
 

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:02.458
Both of them were imprisoned on
the orders of parliament and

00:09:02.458 --> 00:09:05.826
Strafford found himself the
object of impeachment

00:09:05.826 --> 00:09:06.950
proceedings.
 

00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:11.028
Then in December 1640
parliament received,

00:09:11.028 --> 00:09:14.951
graciously, from the city of
London a petition known as the

00:09:14.951 --> 00:09:19.009
Root and Branch Petition against
episcopacy in the church and

00:09:19.009 --> 00:09:22.389
calling for further reformation
in the church.

00:09:22.389 --> 00:09:25.498
It was accompanied by large
demonstrations of London

00:09:25.498 --> 00:09:27.510
citizens,
orderly demonstrations

00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:30.190
accompanying the petition to the
parliament,

00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:35.610
but it showed how well London
was organized in opposition.

00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:39.019
In February 1641,
after a brief recess,

00:09:39.019 --> 00:09:44.046
the Triennial Act was passed
and the King was reluctantly

00:09:44.046 --> 00:09:46.379
forced to agree to it.
 

00:09:46.379 --> 00:09:51.470
The Triennial Act laid down
that in future parliaments must

00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:54.629
be elected every three years
and,

00:09:54.629 --> 00:10:00.984
a few months later in May 1641,
the King further agreed that

00:10:00.984 --> 00:10:07.447
the present parliament could not
be dissolved without its own

00:10:07.447 --> 00:10:08.740
consent.
 

00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:12.554
The spring of 1641 also saw
Strafford's impeachment

00:10:12.554 --> 00:10:16.751
proceedings in the House of
Lords which gradually turned

00:10:16.751 --> 00:10:20.720
into a trial of the entire
regime of the 1630s,

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:25.256
in particular the exercise by
the King of forms of arbitrary

00:10:25.256 --> 00:10:27.313
power,
with Strafford's backing

00:10:27.313 --> 00:10:29.019
according to the allegations.
 

00:10:29.019 --> 00:10:34.067
And in May 1641 Strafford was
the object of an act of

00:10:34.067 --> 00:10:39.212
attainder, the King was
reluctantly forced to sign his

00:10:39.212 --> 00:10:43.000
death warrant,
and he was executed.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:48.769
Then in the summer of 1641 came
a batch of reforming statutes.

00:10:48.769 --> 00:10:53.238
The prerogative courts which
had enforced the royal will in

00:10:53.238 --> 00:10:55.912
the 1630s,
especially the Court of Star

00:10:55.912 --> 00:10:58.419
Chamber which had dealt with
dissidents,

00:10:58.419 --> 00:11:00.200
were abolished.
 

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:03.080
Ship Money was declared illegal.
 

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:07.395
The other financial expedients
which had been used by Charles

00:11:07.395 --> 00:11:10.490
in the 1630s were also declared
illegal,

00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:17.278
and to all of this the King
reluctantly gave his assent.

00:11:17.278 --> 00:11:22.226
By the high summer of 1641
then, it looked as if parliament

00:11:22.226 --> 00:11:23.080
had won.
 

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:25.830
Charles' innovations had been
reversed.

00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:28.669
Strafford, his strongman,
was dead;

00:11:28.669 --> 00:11:33.010
Laud was in the Tower of London;
parliament had secured for

00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:37.221
itself a regular place in
government through the Triennial

00:11:37.221 --> 00:11:37.740
Act.
 

00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:44.226
It appeared to have been a
bloodless, or almost bloodless,

00:11:44.226 --> 00:11:50.600
constitutional revolution,
but of course the game was not

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:52.080
yet over.
 

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:56.022
Parliament went into recess in
the summer of 1641 and Charles

00:11:56.022 --> 00:11:58.980
took the opportunity to travel
to Scotland.

00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:03.828
There he agreed to a settlement
regarding the Church of Scotland

00:12:03.828 --> 00:12:07.986
by withdrawing his earlier
demands and this secured the

00:12:07.986 --> 00:12:12.759
withdrawal of the Scottish army
from the north of England.

00:12:12.759 --> 00:12:17.607
In early November 1641 when
parliament met again a second

00:12:17.607 --> 00:12:19.600
major event occurred.
 

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:24.470
News arrived in London of
rebellion in Ireland,

00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:28.259
a Catholic and nationalist
rebellion involving,

00:12:28.259 --> 00:12:33.812
allegedly, massacres of English
and Scottish settlers in

00:12:33.812 --> 00:12:35.730
northern Ireland.
 

00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:41.668
Now I should take a moment to
explain briefly the Irish

00:12:41.668 --> 00:12:42.990
situation.
 

00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:46.607
In the aftermath of the
rebellion against Elizabeth by

00:12:46.607 --> 00:12:49.340
the Earl of Tyrone in the late
1590s,

00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:55.297
land had been confiscated from
the chieftains of northeastern

00:12:55.297 --> 00:12:58.357
Ireland,
the area known as Ulster,

00:12:58.357 --> 00:13:02.846
and that land had been planted
with Protestant settlements

00:13:02.846 --> 00:13:07.649
mostly peopled by settlers who
came across from Scotland,

00:13:07.649 --> 00:13:11.418
southern Scotland,
and from England.

00:13:11.418 --> 00:13:15.450
Their relations with the Irish
population were fraught from the

00:13:15.450 --> 00:13:16.230
beginning.
 

00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:20.990
By 1641, some of the Irish
chieftains in Ulster,

00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:25.840
resentful of their loss of land
and of power in that area,

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:30.058
planned to imitate the Scots by
rebelling,

00:13:30.058 --> 00:13:32.490
seizing control of the Irish
government,

00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:37.120
and then negotiating a better
settlement.

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:41.106
Once the rebellion began,
however, they proved unable to

00:13:41.106 --> 00:13:42.048
control it.
 

00:13:42.048 --> 00:13:46.635
Some of their followers began
killings of settlers and

00:13:46.635 --> 00:13:48.798
seizures of their land.
 

00:13:48.798 --> 00:13:52.572
Meanwhile, the so-called Old
English aristocracy of other

00:13:52.572 --> 00:13:55.328
parts of Ireland,
most of whom were Roman

00:13:55.328 --> 00:13:59.067
Catholics--they were descended
from medieval Norman conquerors

00:13:59.067 --> 00:14:02.317
of Irish land,
known as the Old English--they

00:14:02.317 --> 00:14:06.162
joined in the rebellion,
principally motivated by the

00:14:06.162 --> 00:14:09.701
fact that as Roman Catholics
they were fearful of a

00:14:09.701 --> 00:14:13.947
Puritan-dominated parliament in
London and what it might mean

00:14:13.947 --> 00:14:14.940
for them.
 

00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:18.495
With the joining together of
these two sources of discontent

00:14:18.495 --> 00:14:21.629
in Ireland the rebellion became
both a religious,

00:14:21.629 --> 00:14:25.177
a Roman Catholic,
and a nationalist rebellion

00:14:25.177 --> 00:14:29.852
fueled by bitter resentments
against the plantations in the

00:14:29.852 --> 00:14:32.354
north,
marked by massacres and

00:14:32.354 --> 00:14:34.178
evictions of settlements.
 

00:14:34.178 --> 00:14:37.440
It's estimated--the figures
keep changing as more research

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:40.371
is done,
but perhaps 4,000 Protestant

00:14:40.371 --> 00:14:45.306
settlers were killed and some
thousands more probably died of

00:14:45.306 --> 00:14:49.500
cold and hunger during the
winter of 1641 to '2.

00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:53.460
So Ireland had exploded,
and news of these events,

00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:57.534
sometimes wildly
exaggerated--bad enough as it

00:14:57.534 --> 00:15:00.485
was--
confirmed, it seemed to members

00:15:00.485 --> 00:15:05.184
of parliament,
the fears that there was indeed

00:15:05.184 --> 00:15:07.558
a popish plot afoot.
 

00:15:07.558 --> 00:15:11.256
But it also raised the crucial
question of what was to be done

00:15:11.256 --> 00:15:13.440
in the face of this new
rebellion?

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:16.570
Could the King be granted an
army to suppress it?

00:15:16.570 --> 00:15:19.058
Could he be trusted with an
army?

00:15:19.058 --> 00:15:23.080
Would he not use it first
against parliament?

00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:28.504
On November the 23rd,
1641, John Pym decided to press

00:15:28.504 --> 00:15:29.340
ahead.
 

00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:33.422
He introduced in to the House
of Commons the so-called Grand

00:15:33.422 --> 00:15:34.460
Remonstrance.
 

00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:38.965
It was a long document,
a comprehensive indictment of

00:15:38.965 --> 00:15:44.509
Charles' misrule ever since he
had come to the throne in 1625;

00:15:44.509 --> 00:15:48.993
all of these points set out in
order to justify the demand that

00:15:48.993 --> 00:15:53.186
henceforward parliament should
have the power to choose the

00:15:53.186 --> 00:15:56.389
King's councilors,
thereby having control over

00:15:56.389 --> 00:15:59.070
whatever forces might be granted
to the King,

00:15:59.070 --> 00:16:02.798
and that an assembly of divines
should meet to determine the

00:16:02.798 --> 00:16:06.274
future structure of the Church
of England to satisfy the

00:16:06.274 --> 00:16:09.120
Puritan zealots amongst Pym's
supporters.

00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:14.618
This radical action finally
split what had been hitherto a

00:16:14.618 --> 00:16:18.379
fairly unified opposition to
Charles.

00:16:18.379 --> 00:16:22.163
This seemed to confirm the
theory that there were indeed

00:16:22.163 --> 00:16:25.671
"popular spirits"
seeking to undermine the

00:16:25.671 --> 00:16:28.558
monarchy and the ancient
constitution.

00:16:28.558 --> 00:16:33.270
So both of those conspiracy
theories which I mentioned last

00:16:33.270 --> 00:16:37.090
time seemed to have been
confirmed by events.

00:16:37.090 --> 00:16:39.960
There were also some members of
parliament who,

00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:44.058
much as they opposed Laud's
innovations in the church,

00:16:44.058 --> 00:16:47.697
did not want a Puritan assault
upon the episcopal structure of

00:16:47.697 --> 00:16:49.129
the Church of England.
 

00:16:49.129 --> 00:16:52.279
That was going too far in their
view.

00:16:52.279 --> 00:16:55.110
The whole issue raised by the
Grand Remonstrance--

00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:59.888
the many issues raised by
it--were passionately debated in

00:16:59.888 --> 00:17:04.917
a session which went on until
two o'clock in the morning when

00:17:04.917 --> 00:17:09.613
it was finally passed by the
House of Commons by only 159

00:17:09.613 --> 00:17:14.910
votes to 148,
a narrow victory for John Pym.

00:17:14.910 --> 00:17:20.144
He had the Grand Remonstrance
printed and distributed outside

00:17:20.144 --> 00:17:24.068
parliament into the country to
win support.

00:17:24.068 --> 00:17:30.276
So, with the Grand Remonstrance
what had been a virtually united

00:17:30.276 --> 00:17:34.019
opposition to the King was
dividing.

00:17:34.019 --> 00:17:38.554
And it was the fact that that
once united opposition split

00:17:38.554 --> 00:17:41.019
that made possible civil war.
 

00:17:41.019 --> 00:17:46.875
It made possible the King's
rallying of a party to his

00:17:46.875 --> 00:17:47.759
cause.
 

00:17:47.759 --> 00:17:51.632
On the 23rd of December,
he rejected the Grand

00:17:51.632 --> 00:17:55.830
Remonstrance,
and then on the 4th of January

00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:58.515
1642,
he attempted a coup by coming

00:17:58.515 --> 00:18:02.634
in person to parliament with
troops to attempt to arrest the

00:18:02.634 --> 00:18:05.078
leaders of the House of Commons.
 

00:18:05.078 --> 00:18:08.210
The five leaders that he was
looking for escaped.

00:18:08.210 --> 00:18:10.690
They had been forewarned of his
arrival.

00:18:10.690 --> 00:18:17.118
They fled downriver and took
refuge in the city of London.

00:18:17.118 --> 00:18:21.659
Faced with this situation,
Charles withdrew from his

00:18:21.659 --> 00:18:22.548
capital.
 

00:18:22.548 --> 00:18:25.509
Some members of parliament were
also withdrawing,

00:18:25.509 --> 00:18:29.269
quietly leaving parliament and
going back to their estates.

00:18:29.269 --> 00:18:34.464
Queen Henrietta Maria left and
went to France to consult with

00:18:34.464 --> 00:18:39.142
her brother, Louis XIII,
and to raise money if possible

00:18:39.142 --> 00:18:42.000
to buy arms for a royal army.
 

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.767
In June 1642--oh,
sorry, in March

00:18:45.767 --> 00:18:52.361
1642--parliament passed an
ordinance known as the Militia

00:18:52.361 --> 00:18:54.009
Ordinance.
 

00:18:54.009 --> 00:18:56.670
An ordinance was not an act of
parliament.

00:18:56.670 --> 00:18:59.328
A full act of parliament needed
the king's signature.

00:18:59.328 --> 00:19:02.387
They had decided to pass
ordinances with the force of

00:19:02.387 --> 00:19:05.010
law,
to legislate without the King,

00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:07.960
and they passed the Militia
Ordinance,

00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:12.025
seizing the right to raise
troops and appoint military

00:19:12.025 --> 00:19:15.884
commanders,
so they too were preparing to

00:19:15.884 --> 00:19:17.230
raise forces.
 

00:19:17.230 --> 00:19:21.614
In June 1642,
they offered to the King the

00:19:21.614 --> 00:19:25.250
so-called Nineteen Propositions.
 

00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:29.085
This included such terms as:
all privy councilors should in

00:19:29.085 --> 00:19:31.400
future be approved by
parliament;

00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:34.483
all major officers of state
should be approved by

00:19:34.483 --> 00:19:36.825
parliament;
the militia order allowing

00:19:36.825 --> 00:19:40.183
parliament to raise troops and
appoint commanders should be

00:19:40.183 --> 00:19:43.336
accepted;
the King should consent to

00:19:43.336 --> 00:19:49.098
whatever reform in the Church of
England parliament advised.

00:19:49.098 --> 00:19:52.991
Charles replied to this
ultimatum that if he was to

00:19:52.991 --> 00:19:55.876
accept this--
I'm quoting him--it would be

00:19:55.876 --> 00:19:59.126
"the total subversion of
the fundamental laws and

00:19:59.126 --> 00:20:01.826
excellent constitution of this
kingdom,"

00:20:01.826 --> 00:20:03.702
for,
he continued,

00:20:03.702 --> 00:20:08.661
"parliament never was
intended for any share in

00:20:08.661 --> 00:20:14.298
government or the choosing of
them that governed."

00:20:14.298 --> 00:20:17.960
Now of course the King was
technically right,

00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:22.126
but things had passed beyond
the question of what was or what

00:20:22.126 --> 00:20:26.363
was not the excellent ancient
constitution to which both sides

00:20:26.363 --> 00:20:28.098
continually appealed.
 

00:20:28.098 --> 00:20:33.529
In different ways both sides of
the dispute had now subverted

00:20:33.529 --> 00:20:38.779
the ancient constitution which
they professed to revere.

00:20:38.779 --> 00:20:43.545
And under the pressure of
events they had gradually

00:20:43.545 --> 00:20:49.262
entered completely uncharted
waters, a situation which no one

00:20:49.262 --> 00:20:52.788
had envisaged,
let alone planned.

00:20:52.788 --> 00:20:57.205
In July 1642,
parliament voted to raise an

00:20:57.205 --> 00:20:57.960
army.
 

00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:01.213
In August 1642,
Charles, having rejected

00:21:01.213 --> 00:21:05.260
parliament's terms,
raised his banner in the city

00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:09.760
of Nottingham and called on all
true subjects to come to his

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:10.598
support.
 

00:21:10.598 --> 00:21:14.425
In fact, by the time Charles
raised the royal standard at

00:21:14.425 --> 00:21:18.251
Nottingham fighting had already
broken out in the town of

00:21:18.251 --> 00:21:22.146
Manchester in the northwest
where the townspeople resisted

00:21:22.146 --> 00:21:25.972
the attempts by one of the
King's supporters to seize the

00:21:25.972 --> 00:21:28.160
town's magazine of arms.
 

00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:30.868
The first shots were fired that
day.

00:21:30.868 --> 00:21:39.796
England was at war:
at war with its own king and at

00:21:39.796 --> 00:21:43.009
war with itself.
 

00:21:43.009 --> 00:21:49.608
So, by the time civil war broke
out in July,

00:21:49.608 --> 00:21:53.308
August 1642,
the combination of a determined

00:21:53.308 --> 00:21:58.644
effort to reverse Charles I 's
policies in church and state and

00:21:58.644 --> 00:22:03.720
the unforeseen circumstances
provoked by the Irish rebellion

00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:08.624
had led parliament to make what
might reasonably be called

00:22:08.624 --> 00:22:11.980
revolutionary political claims.
 

00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:16.338
But how far would it go and
where would it end?

00:22:16.338 --> 00:22:19.400
Those questions were now to be
settled by war,

00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:24.848
and it was a war which itself
unleashed a further dynamic of

00:22:24.848 --> 00:22:29.930
unforeseen circumstances and
unforeseen consequences.

00:22:29.930 --> 00:22:34.891
That continuing dynamic perhaps
derived ultimately from the

00:22:34.891 --> 00:22:40.193
complexity of the causes of the
war and the various meshings of

00:22:40.193 --> 00:22:44.471
motives which led people to
fight and also from the

00:22:44.471 --> 00:22:49.858
remarkable breadth of voluntary
participation in the war.

00:22:49.858 --> 00:22:53.779
The participation in the
fighting was remarkably wide

00:22:53.779 --> 00:22:54.608
socially.
 

00:22:54.608 --> 00:22:59.852
It's been estimated that
perhaps a fifth of all adult men

00:22:59.852 --> 00:23:03.690
in the kingdom fought in the
civil war.

00:23:03.690 --> 00:23:07.951
Now historians have long argued
the toss about the real causes

00:23:07.951 --> 00:23:10.624
of the war--
it's one of the great debates

00:23:10.624 --> 00:23:14.380
of English historiography--
and usually when they do so

00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:18.621
they try to emphasize a
particular dominant variable in

00:23:18.621 --> 00:23:20.818
their own interpretation.
 

00:23:20.818 --> 00:23:24.896
They frequently seek for a
single prime mover,

00:23:24.896 --> 00:23:26.798
the dominant cause.
 

00:23:26.798 --> 00:23:31.358
Really I think that that's a
foolish exercise,

00:23:31.358 --> 00:23:35.260
because the essential point it
seems to me about the civil wars

00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:38.973
is that they were about subtly
different things to different

00:23:38.973 --> 00:23:43.412
people who participated,
and indeed all of the competing

00:23:43.412 --> 00:23:47.613
modern interpretations--
be they Whig or Marxist or

00:23:47.613 --> 00:23:51.205
revisionist--
all of them can be prefigured

00:23:51.205 --> 00:23:55.288
in the views of some
contemporaries themselves.

00:23:55.288 --> 00:23:58.749
Different people at the time
thought the war was about

00:23:58.749 --> 00:23:59.990
different things.
 

00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:03.796
To the Scots it was about
religion and the distinctive

00:24:03.796 --> 00:24:08.105
institutions of what was still
an independent kingdom even if

00:24:08.105 --> 00:24:11.769
it had the same king as the
kingdom of England.

00:24:11.769 --> 00:24:16.660
To the Irish it was about land
and about religion.

00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:21.431
Amongst the English some
royalists joined the King simply

00:24:21.431 --> 00:24:22.880
out of loyalty.
 

00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:25.240
He was the King.
 

00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:28.623
Some saw themselves as
defending the monarch's

00:24:28.623 --> 00:24:33.058
legitimate constitutional rights
against popular spirits.

00:24:33.058 --> 00:24:36.904
Some saw themselves as
defending the Church of England

00:24:36.904 --> 00:24:39.880
against a Puritan plot to
dismantle it.

00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:42.058
Some Roman Catholics joined the
King--

00:24:42.058 --> 00:24:44.250
many of them joined the King in
fact--

00:24:44.250 --> 00:24:48.756
out of fear of what a Puritan
victory might mean and in the

00:24:48.756 --> 00:24:53.573
hope that if they supported the
King he might grant them future

00:24:53.573 --> 00:24:57.380
toleration in the exercise of
their religion.

00:24:57.380 --> 00:25:02.166
Some gentlemen joined him
because they feared social

00:25:02.166 --> 00:25:03.200
disorder.
 

00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:06.180
They feared that a collapse of
regular government would lead to

00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:09.631
a breakdown of social order,
a fear which was much played

00:25:09.631 --> 00:25:13.345
upon by royalist propaganda
which stressed the plebian

00:25:13.345 --> 00:25:16.988
nature of many of those who had
shown support for the

00:25:16.988 --> 00:25:20.970
parliament,
the demonstrators in London for

00:25:20.970 --> 00:25:21.778
example.
 

00:25:21.778 --> 00:25:25.339
Parliamentarians were early
labeled by royalist

00:25:25.339 --> 00:25:30.489
propagandists as Roundheads,
people with short haircuts,

00:25:30.489 --> 00:25:36.459
which meant common people,
not wearing the flowing locks

00:25:36.459 --> 00:25:38.180
of a gentleman.
 

00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:41.521
On the other side,
some parliamentarians saw

00:25:41.521 --> 00:25:46.108
themselves as defending the
ancient constitution and the law

00:25:46.108 --> 00:25:49.529
against a king who could not be
trusted.

00:25:49.529 --> 00:25:52.909
If they had encroached on the
powers of Charles I,

00:25:52.909 --> 00:25:56.910
it was not because they were
attacking monarchy as such.

00:25:56.910 --> 00:25:59.855
The battle cry for the
parliamentarian armies was

00:25:59.855 --> 00:26:02.189
"for the King and
parliament"

00:26:02.189 --> 00:26:05.625
whereas the war cry of the
royalists was simply "for

00:26:05.625 --> 00:26:08.388
the King,"
but the parliamentarian slogan

00:26:08.388 --> 00:26:11.088
was "King and
parliament."

00:26:11.088 --> 00:26:14.807
Others saw themselves as
defending English Protestantism

00:26:14.807 --> 00:26:16.700
against popish innovation.
 

00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:20.115
Many banners of regiments
raised in the parliament's

00:26:20.115 --> 00:26:22.930
support had religious symbols
upon them.

00:26:22.930 --> 00:26:27.413
Some saw it as the moment at
last at which they could move

00:26:27.413 --> 00:26:32.288
beyond the traditional Anglican
settlement and achieve a fuller

00:26:32.288 --> 00:26:35.200
reformation in church and
nation.

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:39.700
Much intensive research has
been done on side taking,

00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:43.381
and it suggests that both
socially and geographically

00:26:43.381 --> 00:26:47.769
there were differences in the
composition of the two sides,

00:26:47.769 --> 00:26:51.118
but really they were just
differences of degree;

00:26:51.118 --> 00:26:54.990
they were not absolutely clear
divisions.

00:26:54.990 --> 00:26:58.413
So, for example,
two thirds of the House of

00:26:58.413 --> 00:27:02.490
Lords were for the King,
but one third of the lords

00:27:02.490 --> 00:27:06.155
fought for parliament;
the earls of Manchester,

00:27:06.155 --> 00:27:08.798
of Bedford, of Warwick,
of Northumberland,

00:27:08.798 --> 00:27:11.118
and others fought for
parliament.

00:27:11.118 --> 00:27:14.736
Most of the gentry actually
managed to stay out of it

00:27:14.736 --> 00:27:17.690
altogether,
but of the very large minority

00:27:17.690 --> 00:27:21.650
who did fight no significant
difference can be found in terms

00:27:21.650 --> 00:27:24.950
of their relative social and
economic position.

00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:28.134
Where the differences can be
discerned they seem to have been

00:27:28.134 --> 00:27:31.701
differences of principle,
sometimes religious principle,

00:27:31.701 --> 00:27:34.200
sometimes constitutional
principle.

00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:38.611
So this was a war in which many
of those who took part

00:27:38.611 --> 00:27:43.271
understood it as having a
powerful ideological element of

00:27:43.271 --> 00:27:45.269
one kind or another.
 

00:27:45.269 --> 00:27:50.109
And much of this was true also
of the common people because

00:27:50.109 --> 00:27:55.202
they didn't participate simply
as dutiful tenants or impressed

00:27:55.202 --> 00:27:55.868
men.
 

00:27:55.868 --> 00:28:02.108
Of course, some did,
but many voluntarily took part.

00:28:02.108 --> 00:28:05.362
Predictably,
the loyalties of the so-called

00:28:05.362 --> 00:28:08.460
'middle sort of people' counted
most,

00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:11.847
the kinds of people who were
leaders in their townships and

00:28:11.847 --> 00:28:15.142
parishes,
and they seemed to have been

00:28:15.142 --> 00:28:20.048
moved by similar motivations to
those of the gentry.

00:28:20.048 --> 00:28:23.994
Amongst them we hear most in
contemporary sources about a

00:28:23.994 --> 00:28:26.318
tendency to support parliament.
 

00:28:26.318 --> 00:28:29.828
Most of them seem indeed to
have been on that side.

00:28:29.828 --> 00:28:33.229
We mustn't forget that these
were people who also

00:28:33.229 --> 00:28:36.840
participated in local
government, albeit at a humble

00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:37.548
level.
 

00:28:37.548 --> 00:28:40.611
Many of them,
if they had freehold land or

00:28:40.611 --> 00:28:43.971
were citizens of towns with a
broad franchise,

00:28:43.971 --> 00:28:46.660
had taken part in the
elections.

00:28:46.660 --> 00:28:50.528
They were people who had signed
the county and municipal

00:28:50.528 --> 00:28:55.170
petitions which had been brought
to the Long Parliament in 1640.

00:28:55.170 --> 00:28:58.262
And amongst such people,
amongst the middle sort as

00:28:58.262 --> 00:29:01.909
contemporaries called them,
one contemporary observer,

00:29:01.909 --> 00:29:04.420
Richard Baxter,
tells us there were many

00:29:04.420 --> 00:29:07.769
"Good Commonwealth's
Men," as he described them,

00:29:07.769 --> 00:29:10.950
concerned about law,
about taxation,

00:29:10.950 --> 00:29:14.380
about the liberties and
survival of parliament,

00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:17.805
though Baxter added that
amongst them also were many who

00:29:17.805 --> 00:29:21.681
were sensible of these things--
I'm quoting him--"sensible

00:29:21.681 --> 00:29:25.031
of these things but much more
sensible of the interests of

00:29:25.031 --> 00:29:26.088
religion."
 

00:29:26.088 --> 00:29:32.358
Again ideological issues
percolating far down in society.

00:29:32.358 --> 00:29:35.417
As with the gentry,
most of the middle sort of

00:29:35.417 --> 00:29:39.020
people did stay out of it but of
those who voluntarily

00:29:39.020 --> 00:29:42.759
participated a great many were
for the parliament,

00:29:42.759 --> 00:29:46.088
a mirror image of the
aristocracy.

00:29:46.088 --> 00:29:50.193
And the major towns and
industrial areas were all

00:29:50.193 --> 00:29:52.759
parliamentarian in sympathy.
 

00:29:52.759 --> 00:29:56.756
So one could say if the
royalist propaganda of the early

00:29:56.756 --> 00:30:00.680
years of the war tended to be
aristocratic in tone,

00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:05.012
a good deal of the propaganda
of the parliament was aimed

00:30:05.012 --> 00:30:09.578
broadly in society and was
somewhat populist in its tone.

00:30:09.578 --> 00:30:14.400
So for many of the middle sort
too this was their cause also.

00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:19.470
But, be that as it may,
they didn't call the tune.

00:30:19.470 --> 00:30:24.313
Both sides of the war were
directed by gentlemen,

00:30:24.313 --> 00:30:30.164
and in approaching the actual
events of the war it helps to

00:30:30.164 --> 00:30:34.000
consider what their war aims
were.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.088
The aims of the King and his
advisers were simple.

00:30:37.088 --> 00:30:42.095
The King intended to win and
then dictate terms to a defeated

00:30:42.095 --> 00:30:43.180
parliament.
 

00:30:43.180 --> 00:30:45.682
To that end,
his basic strategy was to

00:30:45.682 --> 00:30:49.539
consolidate his control of
territory in the north and west

00:30:49.539 --> 00:30:53.801
of England where his supporters
were in the majority and then to

00:30:53.801 --> 00:30:56.779
advance upon London and take the
city.

00:30:56.779 --> 00:31:01.515
Early in the war his principal
base was established

00:31:01.515 --> 00:31:07.198
on--in--Oxford and from Oxford
he intended to advance to take

00:31:07.198 --> 00:31:08.240
London.
 

00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:09.460
Simple enough.
 

00:31:09.460 --> 00:31:13.780
He almost achieved it in 1642
when some of his troops arrived

00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:18.102
on the very outskirts of London
and were turned back by armed

00:31:18.102 --> 00:31:22.494
apprentices from the city who
advanced to meet them at Turnham

00:31:22.494 --> 00:31:23.358
Green.
 

00:31:23.358 --> 00:31:25.940
The royalists for whatever
reason chose not to attack;

00:31:25.940 --> 00:31:29.608
they retreated and the city was
saved.

00:31:29.608 --> 00:31:31.344
(Turnham Green,
incidentally,

00:31:31.344 --> 00:31:34.813
is on the tube line as you go
in from Heathrow Airport to

00:31:34.813 --> 00:31:35.990
central London.
 

00:31:35.990 --> 00:31:39.738
If you're ever going in that
way on a visit to London,

00:31:39.738 --> 00:31:42.848
you would go right through
Turnham Green).

00:31:42.848 --> 00:31:44.883
Not all who fought for the
King, however,

00:31:44.883 --> 00:31:46.460
shared these simple war aims.
 

00:31:46.460 --> 00:31:49.767
There were plenty amongst them
who had actually opposed him in

00:31:49.767 --> 00:31:53.130
1640 but who couldn't bring
themselves to fight against him.

00:31:53.130 --> 00:31:56.470
They would have preferred a
negotiated settlement,

00:31:56.470 --> 00:32:00.468
but although Charles
occasionally paused to engage in

00:32:00.468 --> 00:32:04.619
negotiations for tactical
reasons it's unlikely that he

00:32:04.619 --> 00:32:06.618
ever did it seriously.
 

00:32:06.618 --> 00:32:09.700
The war aims of parliament were
different.

00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:14.169
Parliament neither sought nor
expected an outright military

00:32:14.169 --> 00:32:14.940
victory.
 

00:32:14.940 --> 00:32:19.433
The aim was to achieve a
strategic superiority which

00:32:19.433 --> 00:32:23.400
would then force the King to
come to terms.

00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:26.775
The idea was to hold the south
and the east and the major

00:32:26.775 --> 00:32:30.028
cities where parliamentarian
support was strongest,

00:32:30.028 --> 00:32:33.827
to contest the north and the
west in order to weaken the

00:32:33.827 --> 00:32:37.053
King,
and above all to prevent the

00:32:37.053 --> 00:32:39.440
King from taking London.
 

00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:42.752
Parliamentary armies were
organized in regional

00:32:42.752 --> 00:32:46.282
associations based on
associations of counties who

00:32:46.282 --> 00:32:50.390
raised troops to operate only
within their own zone,

00:32:50.390 --> 00:32:54.279
in addition to which a field
army was raised under the

00:32:54.279 --> 00:32:58.611
command of the Earl of Essex
which had the principal duty of

00:32:58.611 --> 00:33:03.308
protecting London by shadowing
royal forces in the Midlands.

00:33:03.308 --> 00:33:07.208
So, the war consisted for the
most part of a great deal of

00:33:07.208 --> 00:33:11.174
regional skirmishing in the
provinces and local campaigning

00:33:11.174 --> 00:33:15.415
by one garrison against another
all over the north and the west

00:33:15.415 --> 00:33:19.731
and the Midlands;
and then campaigns in which the

00:33:19.731 --> 00:33:24.863
major field armies shadowed one
another mostly in the south

00:33:24.863 --> 00:33:29.729
Midlands and in the approaches
to London with occasional

00:33:29.729 --> 00:33:34.858
pitched battles when London was
seriously threatened.

00:33:34.858 --> 00:33:39.337
Such was the basic situation in
the first two years of the war

00:33:39.337 --> 00:33:42.834
from 1642 to 1644,
but as the war continued the

00:33:42.834 --> 00:33:47.449
experience of a conflict--
of the conflict--and the need

00:33:47.449 --> 00:33:53.096
to respond to the situations
that it created began to release

00:33:53.096 --> 00:33:57.519
greater passions and to create
new war aims.

00:33:57.519 --> 00:34:01.959
Militarily and politically,
the pattern was of summer

00:34:01.959 --> 00:34:07.166
military campaigns followed by
winter politics when the armies

00:34:07.166 --> 00:34:11.010
were simply encamped in winter
quarters--

00:34:11.010 --> 00:34:13.639
and the result of the summer
campaign affected the politics;

00:34:13.639 --> 00:34:16.389
the result of the winter
politics affected the next

00:34:16.389 --> 00:34:17.380
summer campaign.
 

00:34:17.380 --> 00:34:19.059
That's how it went.
 

00:34:19.059 --> 00:34:22.179
In the summer of 1643,
the King came very close to

00:34:22.179 --> 00:34:23.199
winning again.
 

00:34:23.199 --> 00:34:27.472
He consolidated his strength in
the north and the west and

00:34:27.472 --> 00:34:30.469
seemed poised for a victorious
strike.

00:34:30.469 --> 00:34:34.166
Politically,
parliament saw the emergence

00:34:34.166 --> 00:34:37.768
that winter of three broad
groupings.

00:34:37.768 --> 00:34:40.913
There was a peace group in
parliament who thought it would

00:34:40.913 --> 00:34:44.222
be best to negotiate with the
King now and get the best terms

00:34:44.222 --> 00:34:47.199
that could be obtained before
everything was lost.

00:34:47.199 --> 00:34:49.931
On the other hand,
there was a so-called war

00:34:49.931 --> 00:34:50.440
group.
 

00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:54.610
They had become convinced that
only a more aggressive military

00:34:54.610 --> 00:34:58.713
policy would succeed in bringing
the King to terms and they'd

00:34:58.713 --> 00:35:02.474
have to defeat him militarily
first before he would talk

00:35:02.474 --> 00:35:03.570
seriously.
 

00:35:03.570 --> 00:35:07.246
And between the two was a large
middle group which could be

00:35:07.246 --> 00:35:10.099
swayed either way by debates in
parliament.

00:35:10.099 --> 00:35:14.806
Late in 1643,
the war group with the backing

00:35:14.806 --> 00:35:18.476
of John Pym,
who at this time was actually

00:35:18.476 --> 00:35:22.250
dying of cancer and had died by
the end of the year,

00:35:22.250 --> 00:35:25.840
the war group decided that it
was necessary to try to bring

00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:28.835
the Scots back in,
in order to break the

00:35:28.835 --> 00:35:32.150
royalists' hold on the north of
England.

00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:36.789
And in September they
negotiated the Solemn League and

00:35:36.789 --> 00:35:40.380
Covenant with the Scottish
Covenanters.

00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:45.230
It was agreed that the Scots
would aid parliament militarily,

00:35:45.230 --> 00:35:49.467
but the price of their support
was acceptance of reform of the

00:35:49.467 --> 00:35:52.731
Church of England
"according to the word of

00:35:52.731 --> 00:35:56.900
God and the example of the best
reformed churches."

00:35:56.900 --> 00:35:58.630
That was the wording of the
treaty.

00:35:58.630 --> 00:36:03.139
The Scots understood that to
mean Presbyterianism.

00:36:03.139 --> 00:36:07.010
An assembly was set up at
Westminster of English divines,

00:36:07.010 --> 00:36:09.940
more than a hundred ministers,
a number of lay commissioners,

00:36:09.940 --> 00:36:14.353
and Scottish observers to
discuss a future religious

00:36:14.353 --> 00:36:15.480
settlement.
 

00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:20.884
Almost simultaneously,
in the autumn of 1643,

00:36:20.884 --> 00:36:27.639
Charles agreed a cessation of
hostilities in Ireland.

00:36:27.639 --> 00:36:32.280
The Irish rebel confederation
held power there.

00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:36.849
The cessation of hostilities by
the remaining royalist garrisons

00:36:36.849 --> 00:36:41.128
was achieved in order to get aid
for the King from the Irish

00:36:41.128 --> 00:36:42.869
rebel confederation.
 

00:36:42.869 --> 00:36:47.070
They would bring in
reinforcements from the west.

00:36:47.070 --> 00:36:48.987
All of this,
both the bringing in of the

00:36:48.987 --> 00:36:51.400
Scots and the bringing in of the
Irish rebels,

00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:56.532
of course, inevitably
heightened the already existing

00:36:56.532 --> 00:37:02.159
sense of the war as being in
part a religious conflict.

00:37:02.159 --> 00:37:07.360
1644 brought another shift.
 

00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:11.039
The entry of the Scots
facilitated parliament's

00:37:11.039 --> 00:37:12.960
recovery in the north.
 

00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:17.737
The Scots swept south again,
recovered Newcastle and began

00:37:17.737 --> 00:37:20.170
besieging the city of York.
 

00:37:20.170 --> 00:37:23.699
Charles detached his nephew,
Prince Rupert,

00:37:23.699 --> 00:37:26.268
to relieve the threat to York
which --

00:37:26.268 --> 00:37:31.117
with--an army which proceeded
north and expected an easy

00:37:31.117 --> 00:37:33.940
victory in relieving the city.
 

00:37:33.940 --> 00:37:36.079
But he got quite a surprise.
 

00:37:36.079 --> 00:37:39.150
The Scots together with the
army of the Eastern Association,

00:37:39.150 --> 00:37:41.932
which was based in Cambridge
and had men from the eastern

00:37:41.932 --> 00:37:44.893
counties,
advanced north to join the

00:37:44.893 --> 00:37:50.438
Scots and fought outside York
the great battle of Marston Moor

00:37:50.438 --> 00:37:55.347
at which the royalists under
Prince Rupert were utterly

00:37:55.347 --> 00:37:56.619
defeated.
 

00:37:56.619 --> 00:38:01.306
The parliamentarian victory was
in particularly due to the role

00:38:01.306 --> 00:38:04.710
of the cavalry of the Eastern
Association,

00:38:04.710 --> 00:38:08.610
under the command of a figure
who was rapidly emerging in the

00:38:08.610 --> 00:38:11.210
parliamentary forces:
Oliver Cromwell.

00:38:11.210 --> 00:38:17.235
And a brief word about
Cromwell: Cromwell was a squire

00:38:17.235 --> 00:38:23.251
of high birth but low means,
a younger son who had been MP

00:38:23.251 --> 00:38:27.717
for Cambridge in the Long
Parliament and who had left

00:38:27.717 --> 00:38:32.012
parliament in order to raise
forces for the Eastern

00:38:32.012 --> 00:38:35.449
Association at the outbreak of
war.

00:38:35.449 --> 00:38:40.206
He had gradually risen from
captain of a troop to colonel of

00:38:40.206 --> 00:38:41.900
a cavalry regiment.
 

00:38:41.900 --> 00:38:44.490
He was a man who has been
described as a man of

00:38:44.490 --> 00:38:46.461
"agonies and
exultations,"

00:38:46.461 --> 00:38:50.010
passionately religious,
something of a depressive.

00:38:50.010 --> 00:38:53.295
He found himself in the war,
he found the cause he'd been

00:38:53.295 --> 00:38:56.817
looking for, and his troops were
known for their training and

00:38:56.817 --> 00:38:58.050
their discipline.
 

00:38:58.050 --> 00:38:59.849
It was their conduct at Marston
Moor,

00:38:59.849 --> 00:39:03.239
in particular their capacity
after a charge to rally,

00:39:03.239 --> 00:39:07.981
re-form, and charge again,
which had done a good deal to

00:39:07.981 --> 00:39:13.500
defeat the gallant but much less
disciplined royalist cavalry.

00:39:13.500 --> 00:39:17.148
The total victory which was
achieved by the Scots and the

00:39:17.148 --> 00:39:21.320
Eastern Association at Marston
Moor was a considerable shock,

00:39:21.320 --> 00:39:25.789
the first complete
parliamentarian victory.

00:39:25.789 --> 00:39:29.384
But the momentum of that
victory was squandered by the

00:39:29.384 --> 00:39:32.030
parliament's commanders in the
south.

00:39:32.030 --> 00:39:35.518
The indecisiveness and the
incompetence of the senior

00:39:35.518 --> 00:39:39.130
commanders of the south,
the Earl of Essex and the Earl

00:39:39.130 --> 00:39:42.688
of Manchester,
meant that the year ended once

00:39:42.688 --> 00:39:44.420
again in stalemate.
 

00:39:44.420 --> 00:39:48.072
There was another indecisive
holding battle to stop the King

00:39:48.072 --> 00:39:51.184
reaching London at Newbury,
while the Earl of Essex

00:39:51.184 --> 00:39:53.420
advanced down into the west of
England,

00:39:53.420 --> 00:39:58.230
got himself cornered and had to
surrender and have his troops

00:39:58.230 --> 00:40:03.039
ignominiously transported by sea
back to the southeast having

00:40:03.039 --> 00:40:07.210
surrendered their arms to
royalist forces there.

00:40:07.210 --> 00:40:11.802
The second Battle of Newbury,
holding the King back again

00:40:11.802 --> 00:40:15.902
from reaching London,
brought to a head the growing

00:40:15.902 --> 00:40:19.099
tension over parliament's war
aims.

00:40:19.099 --> 00:40:23.960
Cromwell, who'd hastened south
with his cavalry to join

00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:28.201
Manchester at Newbury,
pressed the Earl of Manchester

00:40:28.201 --> 00:40:31.719
to continue the battle to try to
turn it in to the--

00:40:31.719 --> 00:40:33.780
a decisive victory.
 

00:40:33.780 --> 00:40:36.389
Manchester refused to do so.
 

00:40:36.389 --> 00:40:40.800
It was enough for him to stop
the King from advancing further

00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:42.050
towards London.
 

00:40:42.050 --> 00:40:44.820
According to their recorded
argument,

00:40:44.820 --> 00:40:49.277
Manchester declared to
Cromwell, "if we beat the

00:40:49.277 --> 00:40:53.833
King ninety and nine times,
yet he is King still,

00:40:53.833 --> 00:40:57.710
and so will his posterity be
after him,

00:40:57.710 --> 00:41:04.340
and we subjects still,
but if the King beat us once,

00:41:04.340 --> 00:41:08.577
we will all be hanged,
and our posterity be made

00:41:08.577 --> 00:41:09.929
slaves."
 

00:41:09.929 --> 00:41:13.213
In other words,
he didn't dare risk a decisive

00:41:13.213 --> 00:41:13.869
battle.
 

00:41:13.869 --> 00:41:17.788
To which Cromwell replied,
"why then,

00:41:17.788 --> 00:41:21.610
if this be so,
why did we take up arms at

00:41:21.610 --> 00:41:23.139
first?"
 

00:41:23.139 --> 00:41:28.407
The recriminations continued
bitterly in parliament during

00:41:28.407 --> 00:41:33.766
the winter resulting early in
1645 in a victory for the war

00:41:33.766 --> 00:41:36.909
party in the House of Commons.
 

00:41:36.909 --> 00:41:39.757
First of all,
they decided to dissolve the

00:41:39.757 --> 00:41:43.579
existing parliamentarian field
army and to form what was

00:41:43.579 --> 00:41:47.190
described as a New Model Army
which would be paid and

00:41:47.190 --> 00:41:51.150
controlled from Westminster and
would incorporate the best

00:41:51.150 --> 00:41:55.110
elements of all previously
existing parliamentarian forces

00:41:55.110 --> 00:41:59.210
and be free to operate wherever
it was needed throughout the

00:41:59.210 --> 00:42:00.599
kingdom.
 

00:42:00.599 --> 00:42:05.659
Secondly, they passed a
Self-Denying Ordinance.

00:42:05.659 --> 00:42:10.710
The Self-Denying Ordinance
required the resignation of all

00:42:10.710 --> 00:42:14.610
commanders who were members of
parliament.

00:42:14.610 --> 00:42:18.103
It was a clever move to force
the resignation of the

00:42:18.103 --> 00:42:22.349
incompetent aristocratic leaders
of the parliament's troops.

00:42:22.349 --> 00:42:26.980
But there was one exemption
from the Self-Denying Ordinance.

00:42:26.980 --> 00:42:29.030
Cromwell was exempted.
 

00:42:29.030 --> 00:42:33.148
His native military genius by
now had shown itself so clearly

00:42:33.148 --> 00:42:35.619
that he simply couldn't be
spared.

00:42:35.619 --> 00:42:38.574
He was appointed Lieutenant
General of the Horse,

00:42:38.574 --> 00:42:40.730
not commander of the entire
army.

00:42:40.730 --> 00:42:44.260
The Lord General was Sir Thomas
Fairfax,

00:42:44.260 --> 00:42:47.239
the leader of the parliament's
cause in Yorkshire,

00:42:47.239 --> 00:42:51.668
Cromwell was his Lieutenant
General in command of the

00:42:51.668 --> 00:42:52.518
cavalry.
 

00:42:52.518 --> 00:42:57.585
Meanwhile, the war conditions
were having unanticipated

00:42:57.585 --> 00:42:59.929
consequences elsewhere.
 

00:42:59.929 --> 00:43:04.070
London was a city in ferment.
 

00:43:04.070 --> 00:43:09.177
1640 had seen the collapse of
censorship of the press and a

00:43:09.177 --> 00:43:14.197
proliferation of pamphlets
arguing different political and

00:43:14.197 --> 00:43:15.960
religious ideas.
 

00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:19.675
Something in the region of an
average of 1,000 a year were

00:43:19.675 --> 00:43:22.610
being printed in London in the
early 1640s.

00:43:22.610 --> 00:43:27.271
The first newspapers were
beginning to appear reporting on

00:43:27.271 --> 00:43:30.869
the events of the war,
ten a week by 1644.

00:43:30.869 --> 00:43:33.929
There had also been a collapse
of church discipline.

00:43:33.929 --> 00:43:37.726
Radical religious groups were
emerging from underground and

00:43:37.726 --> 00:43:38.840
meeting openly.
 

00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:43.561
New groups were forming in the
debate over future religious

00:43:43.561 --> 00:43:44.619
settlement.
 

00:43:44.619 --> 00:43:49.014
The city was highly politicized
and awash with all kinds of

00:43:49.014 --> 00:43:50.380
heterodox ideas.
 

00:43:50.380 --> 00:43:54.389
In 1646, a Presbyterian
minister, Thomas Edwards,

00:43:54.389 --> 00:43:59.139
was so shocked by the ideas
that were circulating in London

00:43:59.139 --> 00:44:02.659
that he wrote his work
Gangraena,

00:44:02.659 --> 00:44:06.744
which was a three-volume
catalog of heterodox opinions

00:44:06.744 --> 00:44:08.750
circulating in the city.
 

00:44:08.750 --> 00:44:13.168
Edwards was an orthodox
Calvinist utterly horrified at

00:44:13.168 --> 00:44:16.920
what had broken forth and he was
not alone.

00:44:16.920 --> 00:44:21.268
Many more conservatively minded
members of parliament in matters

00:44:21.268 --> 00:44:25.063
of religion began to favor a
Scottish-style Presbyterian

00:44:25.063 --> 00:44:29.275
settlement which would at least
restore order and orthodoxy in

00:44:29.275 --> 00:44:31.070
matters of religion.
 

00:44:31.070 --> 00:44:35.505
And a group of parliamentarian
Presbyterians were able to push

00:44:35.505 --> 00:44:39.507
through acceptance of a
Directory of Worship which would

00:44:39.507 --> 00:44:43.652
replace the Anglican prayer book
and to vote in favor of a

00:44:43.652 --> 00:44:47.943
Presbyterian church structure to
be imposed when the war was

00:44:47.943 --> 00:44:48.889
over.
 

00:44:48.889 --> 00:44:52.253
Others, however,
including Oliver Cromwell,

00:44:52.253 --> 00:44:57.297
were not alarmed by what seemed
to be a new age of the spirit in

00:44:57.297 --> 00:44:59.219
matters of religion.
 

00:44:59.219 --> 00:45:03.733
They favored independency:
congregationalism in church

00:45:03.733 --> 00:45:04.840
government.
 

00:45:04.840 --> 00:45:09.492
They were opposed to the
imposition of any form of

00:45:09.492 --> 00:45:12.909
coercion in matters of
conscience.

00:45:12.909 --> 00:45:17.375
So in these debates going on in
London and in parliament

00:45:17.375 --> 00:45:21.110
religious liberty was emerging
as an issue--

00:45:21.110 --> 00:45:25.110
and for some people another aim
of the conflict--

00:45:25.110 --> 00:45:28.010
which had not been previously
foreseen.

00:45:28.010 --> 00:45:32.532
It was in 1644 that pamphlets
advocating religious toleration

00:45:32.532 --> 00:45:36.753
were quite widely printed and it
saw the printing of John

00:45:36.753 --> 00:45:39.768
Milton's great
Areopagitica,

00:45:39.768 --> 00:45:45.521
his wonderful statement in
favor of freedom of speech and

00:45:45.521 --> 00:45:46.550
thought.
 

00:45:46.550 --> 00:45:49.637
Equally worrying to the more
conservative members of

00:45:49.637 --> 00:45:53.030
parliament was the situation in
the parliament's army.

00:45:53.030 --> 00:45:56.492
Like the city,
the army was a concentration of

00:45:56.492 --> 00:46:00.108
tens of thousands of people in a
mass situation,

00:46:00.108 --> 00:46:02.880
a most unusual social
situation.

00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:05.659
The army was full of volunteers.
 

00:46:05.659 --> 00:46:09.960
They were disproportionately
men of Puritan inclination in

00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:10.789
religion.
 

00:46:10.789 --> 00:46:14.347
Many of them were from London
or East Anglia or the godlier

00:46:14.347 --> 00:46:16.679
areas of the north and the
Midlands.

00:46:16.679 --> 00:46:21.094
By 1644, Oliver Cromwell was
already well known to favor such

00:46:21.094 --> 00:46:25.139
godly men and to have a
preference for promoting them on

00:46:25.139 --> 00:46:27.358
merit,
a shocking idea to

00:46:27.358 --> 00:46:30.099
seventeenth-century
sensibilities.

00:46:30.099 --> 00:46:33.693
Famously he declared in one
argument over the promotion of a

00:46:33.693 --> 00:46:36.858
junior officer,
"I had rather have a

00:46:36.858 --> 00:46:40.469
plain,
russet-coated captain who loves

00:46:40.469 --> 00:46:44.418
what he fights for--
who knows what he fights for

00:46:44.418 --> 00:46:49.623
and loves what he knows,
than that you call a gentleman

00:46:49.623 --> 00:46:52.679
who is nothing else."
 

00:46:52.679 --> 00:46:55.889
With the formation of the New
Model Army in 1645,

00:46:55.889 --> 00:46:59.702
all of these elements were
brought together and it took on

00:46:59.702 --> 00:47:01.909
a very distinctive character.
 

00:47:01.909 --> 00:47:04.324
The New Model,
especially amongst its junior

00:47:04.324 --> 00:47:06.585
officers,
was full of Cromwell's

00:47:06.585 --> 00:47:10.445
russet-coated captains,
who knew what they fought for

00:47:10.445 --> 00:47:14.179
and loved what they knew,
promoted on merit.

00:47:14.179 --> 00:47:16.918
It was a praying army,
a preaching army,

00:47:16.918 --> 00:47:20.010
a godly army,
a surprisingly well-disciplined

00:47:20.010 --> 00:47:22.610
army by the standards of the
day.

00:47:22.610 --> 00:47:29.706
And in 1645 that spirit both
contributed to and was enhanced

00:47:29.706 --> 00:47:32.989
by victory--
to seventeenth-century

00:47:32.989 --> 00:47:35.969
sensibilities the proof of God's
favor--

00:47:35.969 --> 00:47:42.139
and with victory came quite
exceptional morale.

00:47:42.139 --> 00:47:45.855
In June 1645,
Fairfax and Cromwell brought to

00:47:45.855 --> 00:47:50.753
battle and decisively defeated
Charles' main battle army at

00:47:50.753 --> 00:47:53.710
Naseby in the central Midlands.
 

00:47:53.710 --> 00:47:58.581
They then rapidly moved west,
cornered the army of the--the

00:47:58.581 --> 00:48:02.699
royalist army of the west at
Langport in Somerset,

00:48:02.699 --> 00:48:05.219
and roundly defeated them.
 

00:48:05.219 --> 00:48:09.333
By late 1645 and early 1646,
it had become largely a matter

00:48:09.333 --> 00:48:13.588
of the army bottling up what
remained of the King's forces in

00:48:13.588 --> 00:48:16.755
Oxford,
seizing and capturing the city

00:48:16.755 --> 00:48:20.668
of Bristol,
and then mopping up the last

00:48:20.668 --> 00:48:22.849
royalist opposition.
 

00:48:22.849 --> 00:48:26.324
By May of 1646,
the King, seeing that there was

00:48:26.324 --> 00:48:29.268
no possibility of military
recovery,

00:48:29.268 --> 00:48:33.452
left Oxford in disguise,
traveled north and gave himself

00:48:33.452 --> 00:48:36.800
up to the Scots at Newark near
Nottingham.

00:48:36.800 --> 00:48:39.960
He thought he'd get better
terms from them.

00:48:39.960 --> 00:48:45.266
So against all initial
expectations parliament had won

00:48:45.266 --> 00:48:47.469
an outright victory.
 

00:48:47.469 --> 00:48:51.876
Achieving that victory,
however, had released forces

00:48:51.876 --> 00:48:56.543
which could not easily be
contained or pushed back into

00:48:56.543 --> 00:48:57.840
the bottle.
 

00:48:57.840 --> 00:49:01.449
After one of the last
skirmishes of 1646,

00:49:01.449 --> 00:49:04.670
the royalist commander,
Sir Alan Apsley,

00:49:04.670 --> 00:49:09.090
surrendered his sword to his
parliamentarian opponent,

00:49:09.090 --> 00:49:13.007
then sat down on a drum and is
said to have said to the

00:49:13.007 --> 00:49:16.574
parliamentarian officers,
"well, boys,

00:49:16.574 --> 00:49:21.179
you have done your work:
now you may go and play,

00:49:21.179 --> 00:49:25.510
unless perhaps you will fall
out amongst yourselves."

00:49:25.510 --> 00:49:28.239
And that was a very prescient
remark,

00:49:28.239 --> 00:49:31.166
because the business of
establishing the terms of

00:49:31.166 --> 00:49:34.411
settlement,
with the victory achieved,

00:49:34.411 --> 00:49:39.748
gradually turned in the next
year into a struggle over what

00:49:39.748 --> 00:49:43.889
was the meaning of the
parliament's cause.

00:49:43.889 --> 00:49:45.599
And we'll turn to that next
time.

00:49:45.599 --> 00:49:51.000

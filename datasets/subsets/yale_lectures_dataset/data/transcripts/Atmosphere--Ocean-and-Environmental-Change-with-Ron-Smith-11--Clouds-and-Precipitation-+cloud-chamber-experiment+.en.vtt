RONALD SMITH: Well, when I
lectured last on

00:01:12.567 --> 00:01:15.500
Wednesday of last week, we went
through a long PowerPoint

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.800
presentation about water
in the atmosphere.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.833
And there's a lot of information
in that.

00:01:22.833 --> 00:01:24.933
And of course, that lecture's
been posted.

00:01:24.933 --> 00:01:27.067
But today we're going to
continue on from there.

00:01:27.067 --> 00:01:29.833
We're not finished with water
in the atmosphere.

00:01:29.833 --> 00:01:31.600
We're going to move more
towards the subject of

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.167
precipitation--

00:01:33.167 --> 00:01:35.033
how precipitation forms.

00:01:35.033 --> 00:01:42.133
And let me begin by just
describing what you see when

00:01:42.133 --> 00:01:44.000
you look at a cloud.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.433
So I've got a little
cartoon here.

00:01:46.433 --> 00:01:47.933
I'm going to make a cloud
in just a minute.

00:01:47.933 --> 00:01:51.733
But what do you see when
you look at a cloud?

00:01:51.733 --> 00:01:52.400
There's a cloud.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.633
There's you as the observer.

00:01:56.833 --> 00:01:59.667
You are-- when you look away
from the cloud, you're seeing

00:01:59.667 --> 00:02:03.800
sunlight that has scattered
off air molecules.

00:02:06.567 --> 00:02:09.933
And that light looks
blue to you.

00:02:09.933 --> 00:02:13.700
When you look at the cloud
itself, you see sunlight that

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.400
is scattered off tiny condensed
water droplets.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.400
And that cloud looks
white to you.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.300
Under certain circumstances,
if you look at the rain

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.933
falling from the cloud and the
light, the orientation of the

00:02:29.933 --> 00:02:34.500
illumination is just right,
you'll see a rainbow.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.167
So what's going on?

00:02:36.167 --> 00:02:39.167
Why do you see three such very
different things when you look

00:02:39.167 --> 00:02:41.633
at a cloud?

00:02:41.633 --> 00:02:44.933
Well, it has to do with the
different types of the way

00:02:44.933 --> 00:02:48.333
light scatters from particles.

00:02:48.333 --> 00:02:51.833
And so I wanted to just run
through this before we got any

00:02:51.833 --> 00:02:53.667
further into clouds.

00:02:53.667 --> 00:02:56.967
If you imagine a photon of
light with a certain

00:02:56.967 --> 00:03:01.367
wavelength lambda approaching
a particle, it's going to be

00:03:01.367 --> 00:03:05.433
scattered off by that particle
in some direction.

00:03:05.433 --> 00:03:09.600
What matters is the ratio of the
wavelength of the light to

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.133
the diameter of the droplet,
that ratio.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.033
If the wavelength is much, much
larger than the diameter

00:03:21.033 --> 00:03:24.833
of the droplet, that's called
Rayleigh scattering, named

00:03:24.833 --> 00:03:29.800
after the famous English
physicist. And under that

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:37.300
condition, the scattering, you
say S, is proportional to one

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.400
over the wavelength to
the fourth power.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.733
In other words, the shorter the
wavelength, the more is

00:03:44.733 --> 00:03:47.867
the scattering under
that condition.

00:03:47.867 --> 00:03:51.400
The shorter the wavelength for
the same particle, the more is

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.767
the scattering.

00:03:53.767 --> 00:03:57.600
Well, that's why the sky is
blue because the visible

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:03.267
spectrum includes red on the
long wave side, green in the

00:04:03.267 --> 00:04:05.800
middle, blue on the
short wave side.

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:10.700
So when light comes from the sun
and encounters these small

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.633
air molecules, the blue light
is scattered more than the

00:04:14.633 --> 00:04:16.900
green and the red.

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:18.500
And therefore, the light
scattered to your eye--

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.833
what you saw this morning as you
walked up, the blue sky.

00:04:21.833 --> 00:04:26.233
That's because that scattering
is from very small molecules

00:04:26.233 --> 00:04:30.933
which places you into the
Rayleigh scattering regime,

00:04:30.933 --> 00:04:35.367
where short wavelengths scatter
more intensely than

00:04:35.367 --> 00:04:36.867
the longer wavelengths.

00:04:36.867 --> 00:04:38.200
So that's why this
sky is blue.

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:43.067
Now the cloud particles
in the cloud are

00:04:43.067 --> 00:04:47.767
much larger than molecules.

00:04:47.767 --> 00:04:55.567
They're typically 10 microns
in size, which is of such a

00:04:55.567 --> 00:04:59.000
wavelength that it puts you
into the so-called Mie

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.833
scattering regime where
wavelength is within one or

00:05:02.833 --> 00:05:05.333
two orders of magnitude
of the diameter.

00:05:05.333 --> 00:05:08.167
It doesn't have to be close to
the same as the diameter but

00:05:08.167 --> 00:05:13.733
within a factor of 10
or 100 of the--

00:05:13.733 --> 00:05:15.067
I see you straining
to see them.

00:05:15.067 --> 00:05:20.133
Let me pull this down,
might help with it.

00:05:20.133 --> 00:05:23.300
Mie scattering, if you're in
that regime, all wavelengths

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:26.133
are scattered roughly equally.

00:05:26.133 --> 00:05:30.000
Red, green, blue light are
scattered equally.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.900
That is whatever color you have
illuminating the object,

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.933
that's the same color
you will get

00:05:36.933 --> 00:05:38.833
reflecting from the object.

00:05:38.833 --> 00:05:42.500
So if you're illuminating the
object with white light, then

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:45.867
the scattered light will be
white as well, have the same

00:05:45.867 --> 00:05:50.133
mix of the different colors
in the spectrum.

00:05:50.133 --> 00:05:53.167
So the cloud appears white
to your eye because it's

00:05:53.167 --> 00:05:56.067
scattering all those different
solar wavelengths equally.

00:05:58.933 --> 00:06:02.400
The other case-- the third case
is when the diameter of

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:05.967
the object is much larger than
the wavelength of light.

00:06:05.967 --> 00:06:10.500
That would apply, by the way,
for a raindrop which has a

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:13.000
diameter of about
one millimeter.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.700
And remember the wavelength
we're talking about, for

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:19.333
example, visible light,
is only 0.5 microns.

00:06:19.333 --> 00:06:22.767
So that would easily
satisfy that.

00:06:22.767 --> 00:06:25.867
And that's the case where
you can trace--

00:06:25.867 --> 00:06:29.133
it's called geometric optics is
the physical name for that

00:06:29.133 --> 00:06:30.667
scattering regime.

00:06:30.667 --> 00:06:34.433
That means you can actually
trace a ray of light that

00:06:34.433 --> 00:06:38.600
comes into the raindrop,
refracts as it enters, bounces

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:42.600
off one side, refracts again,
and comes back to your eye

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:46.833
splitting the color slightly
because refractive index-- the

00:06:46.833 --> 00:06:49.400
bending of the light is a
function of wavelength,

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:52.733
therefore, giving you this
special rainbow effect.

00:06:52.733 --> 00:06:54.533
You couldn't get that
from cloud droplets

00:06:54.533 --> 00:06:56.300
because they're too small.

00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:00.200
But the fact that they're larger
allows you to see that

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:03.500
splitting of the light and the
rainbow forming in that way.

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:11.733
So that is basically what you
see when you look at a cloud,

00:07:11.733 --> 00:07:15.100
and the sky, and
the raindrops.

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:16.467
A couple of other
points though.

00:07:16.467 --> 00:07:19.933
There's another way that
meteorologists look at clouds,

00:07:19.933 --> 00:07:22.433
and that's with radar--

00:07:22.433 --> 00:07:24.667
meteorological radar.

00:07:24.667 --> 00:07:26.400
I've sketched that here.

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:28.067
You've got a dish antenna.

00:07:28.067 --> 00:07:29.933
You make a microwave signal.

00:07:29.933 --> 00:07:31.567
Usually that wavelength
is about 10

00:07:31.567 --> 00:07:34.433
centimeters, about like that.

00:07:34.433 --> 00:07:36.667
You send it towards the cloud.

00:07:36.667 --> 00:07:43.533
And it may or may not scatter
back to your radar system.

00:07:43.533 --> 00:07:47.367
If it does, you can determine
the distance from the time it

00:07:47.367 --> 00:07:49.933
takes the radar signal to
get there and back.

00:07:49.933 --> 00:07:52.633
And you can learn something
about the

00:07:52.633 --> 00:07:53.767
particles in that cloud.

00:07:53.767 --> 00:07:58.333
But remember, with a longer
wavelength, the same cloud

00:07:58.333 --> 00:08:02.067
droplets, and even the
raindrops, are going to be in

00:08:02.067 --> 00:08:03.567
the Rayleigh scattering
regime.

00:08:03.567 --> 00:08:06.133
So with this longer wavelength,
you're almost

00:08:06.133 --> 00:08:10.000
always going to be in the
Rayleigh scattering regime

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.500
because your wavelength here
is so much larger than the

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:15.967
wavelength of visible light.

00:08:15.967 --> 00:08:21.600
So with that strong inverse
dependence on wavelength, and

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:26.833
the diameter comes in too, it
turns out that cloud droplets

00:08:26.833 --> 00:08:32.800
do not scatter radar
effectively, but raindrops do.

00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:36.367
So when you're looking at a
radar image of a cloud, you

00:08:36.367 --> 00:08:39.067
are seeing only where
it is raining.

00:08:39.067 --> 00:08:42.767
You do not see the cloud you
see with the visible eye.

00:08:42.767 --> 00:08:45.533
With the visible eye, you see
this white puffy thing full of

00:08:45.533 --> 00:08:46.633
cloud droplets.

00:08:46.633 --> 00:08:47.833
Radar doesn't see that.

00:08:47.833 --> 00:08:48.800
Radar goes right through.

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:53.667
But the radar will bounce off
from the raindrops or the

00:08:53.667 --> 00:08:55.867
snowflakes within that cloud.

00:08:55.867 --> 00:08:58.833
So remember when using a
meteorological radar, you are

00:08:58.833 --> 00:09:04.400
seeing precipitation rather
than clouds per se.

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:08.233
Of course, clouds produced
precipitation, but they are

00:09:08.233 --> 00:09:10.267
different things.

00:09:10.267 --> 00:09:11.500
Any questions on that?

00:09:14.033 --> 00:09:14.300
OK.

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:16.400
Well, that is background.

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:20.333
We can do a little experiment
to make a cloud.

00:09:20.333 --> 00:09:24.333
I've got a vacuum pump hidden
under here and a little grey

00:09:24.333 --> 00:09:27.567
chamber that I'm going
to evacuate.

00:09:27.567 --> 00:09:31.833
I'm going to hook this up
to the jar in this way.

00:09:31.833 --> 00:09:38.167
And then by twisting a valve,
I'm going to allow some of the

00:09:38.167 --> 00:09:44.067
air from this jug to pass into
this evacuated cylinder.

00:09:44.067 --> 00:09:48.833
When I do that, let's say for
the sake of argument that I

00:09:48.833 --> 00:09:52.233
take about that much of the
air from here on up and

00:09:52.233 --> 00:09:54.167
suddenly remove it.

00:09:54.167 --> 00:09:58.267
Well, then the rest of the air
in the jug is going to expand

00:09:58.267 --> 00:09:59.233
to fill the jug.

00:09:59.233 --> 00:10:03.967
Now what happens when air
expands suddenly?

00:10:03.967 --> 00:10:06.567
We've been over and over this,
but now you're going to see it

00:10:06.567 --> 00:10:07.900
in this new context.

00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:12.900
When air expands, it does
work on its environment.

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:16.000
And it adiabatically cools.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.600
Its temperature drops
because of that work

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:21.233
it's done in expansion.

00:10:21.233 --> 00:10:25.567
When the temperature drops, the
saturation vapor pressure

00:10:25.567 --> 00:10:26.333
drops as well.

00:10:26.333 --> 00:10:29.933
That is the amount of water
vapor that can be held in the

00:10:29.933 --> 00:10:33.667
vapor state suddenly
decreases.

00:10:33.667 --> 00:10:38.567
Well, if Ive got-- if this is
the saturation vapor pressure,

00:10:38.567 --> 00:10:40.700
and this is the amount of water
vapor that I actually

00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:44.500
have, the partial pressure of
water vapor, and I suddenly

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:48.200
drop the temperature, that's
going to drop this value down.

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:51.933
I haven't changed the amount of
water in the air, but I've

00:10:51.933 --> 00:10:55.900
decreased the amount that can
be held in the vapor state.

00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:59.067
And if I move it down to this
level and slightly beyond,

00:10:59.067 --> 00:11:02.733
that excess must suddenly
condense.

00:11:02.733 --> 00:11:05.467
It cannot remain in
the vapor state.

00:11:05.467 --> 00:11:10.067
And therefore, I'm going to
force a cloud to form in very

00:11:10.067 --> 00:11:13.300
much the same way that
the atmosphere does,

00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:15.467
by adiabatic expansion.

00:11:15.467 --> 00:11:18.000
The only difference is instead
of getting the adiabatic

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.933
expansion by lifting a parcel
up into the atmosphere, I'm

00:11:21.933 --> 00:11:25.100
doing it with this little
apparatus of suddenly dropping

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:26.833
the pressure.

00:11:26.833 --> 00:11:28.067
Are there questions on this?

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:37.633
Now I'm going to give it a few
condensation nuclei because I

00:11:37.633 --> 00:11:41.900
prefer to form a large number of
small droplets rather than

00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:45.833
a small number of
large droplets.

00:11:45.833 --> 00:11:48.367
It'll make the cloud more
visible that way.

00:11:55.367 --> 00:11:59.933
So I'm just going to blow a
little bit of smoke in there.

00:11:59.933 --> 00:12:11.733
You won't be able to see this,
but these will be very tiny--

00:12:11.733 --> 00:12:14.233
these will be very tiny aerosol
particles just to give

00:12:14.233 --> 00:12:16.533
the water something
to condense on to.

00:12:31.933 --> 00:12:35.233
What you hear is
a vacuum pump.

00:12:35.233 --> 00:12:37.367
I have a little gauge here to
tell me whether or not it's

00:12:37.367 --> 00:12:40.400
working, whether this chamber
is being evacuated.

00:12:53.767 --> 00:12:56.067
I put it on this overhead
projector to get nice

00:12:56.067 --> 00:12:58.733
illumination of the chamber.

00:12:58.733 --> 00:13:00.100
And you see it's empty now.

00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:01.367
There's nothing there.

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:10.600
OK, I think we have a little
bit of a vacuum in here.

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:14.667
So I'm going to try
suddenly opening--

00:13:14.667 --> 00:13:16.267
right now this valve
is closed.

00:13:16.267 --> 00:13:19.167
So there's low pressure
here but normal--

00:13:19.167 --> 00:13:19.700
look--

00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:22.667
normal atmospheric pressure
in the jar.

00:13:22.667 --> 00:13:25.567
But when I open that valve, some
of the air is going to be

00:13:25.567 --> 00:13:26.167
sucked off.

00:13:26.167 --> 00:13:28.833
And we'll see this doesn't
always work.

00:13:28.833 --> 00:13:32.133
But we'll see if we can form
a cloud this morning.

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:44.567
Three, two, one, there's
a cloud.

00:13:47.433 --> 00:13:50.300
Now this is a reversible process
where I suddenly to

00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:53.367
bring that parcel back down to
the atmosphere or here just

00:13:53.367 --> 00:13:56.400
let the pressure build up,
it would compress warm

00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:57.300
and remove the cloud.

00:13:57.300 --> 00:13:59.967
So on the count of three, I'm
just going to rip the top out

00:13:59.967 --> 00:14:04.067
of there and let atmospheric
pressure push that down again.

00:14:04.067 --> 00:14:06.033
Three, two, one.

00:14:08.767 --> 00:14:12.167
I'm going to repeat
that again.

00:14:12.167 --> 00:14:13.733
Let me close this off.

00:14:19.633 --> 00:14:21.200
Let me take questions
for a minute about

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:22.033
what I've done here.

00:14:22.033 --> 00:14:25.267
Are there any questions about
what I'm actually doing

00:14:25.267 --> 00:14:26.533
physically up here?

00:14:30.367 --> 00:14:30.700
Question?

00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:31.900
STUDENT: Can you explain
it again?

00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:36.533
PROFESSOR: So I'm evacuating
this grey cylinder.

00:14:36.533 --> 00:14:40.067
It's just a little reservoir
of low pressure.

00:14:40.067 --> 00:14:43.200
When I open the valve, then
some of this atmospheric

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:46.800
pressure is going to bleed off
into here allowing the rest of

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:50.200
the air to expand suddenly.

00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:53.433
That's just what happens when an
air parcel rises up in the

00:14:53.433 --> 00:14:57.467
atmosphere and expands, cools
adiabatically, drops the

00:14:57.467 --> 00:15:01.567
saturation vapor pressure, and
the excess water vapor must

00:15:01.567 --> 00:15:04.167
then immediately condense.

00:15:04.167 --> 00:15:07.100
And it's finding one of the
small particles in there,

00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:10.400
condensation nuclei,
to condense on.

00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:12.633
Notice how small these
particles are.

00:15:12.633 --> 00:15:14.300
You may have seen them
swirling around.

00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:17.300
But they didn't fall out.

00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:21.033
Let's watch that the next time
I do the experiment here.

00:15:21.033 --> 00:15:22.300
I think we're set.

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:29.900
I haven't got a very
good vacuum.

00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:31.533
Maybe this wasn't
closed properly.

00:15:39.867 --> 00:15:41.133
It's OK.

00:15:46.867 --> 00:15:49.167
Three, two, one.

00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:57.333
Now there are tiny particles
in there, but you don't see

00:15:57.333 --> 00:15:59.167
them falling.

00:15:59.167 --> 00:16:01.433
Sometimes you see them swirling
around a little bit.

00:16:01.433 --> 00:16:03.833
There's some air currents
in there.

00:16:03.833 --> 00:16:08.567
But they're so small that they
don't really fall out

00:16:08.567 --> 00:16:10.267
gravitationally.

00:16:10.267 --> 00:16:12.500
I'll reverse the process now.

00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:15.433
Three, two, one.

00:16:15.433 --> 00:16:17.500
And it's gone.

00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:18.767
OK.

00:16:27.333 --> 00:16:31.433
That is how a cloud forms. Are
there questions on that?

00:16:31.433 --> 00:16:33.667
They're must be some mysteries
on what I've done here.

00:16:36.533 --> 00:16:37.833
Anything at all?

00:16:37.833 --> 00:16:40.067
STUDENT: Does the jar feel
cold to the touch?

00:16:40.067 --> 00:16:40.500
PROFESSOR: I'm sorry.

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:41.433
STUDENT: Does the jar feel
cold to the touch?

00:16:41.433 --> 00:16:42.467
PROFESSOR: No.

00:16:42.467 --> 00:16:44.867
I don't think the temperature
drop is enough.

00:16:44.867 --> 00:16:51.133
And the mass of the jar itself
is too large, I think, for

00:16:51.133 --> 00:16:52.433
that to be detectable,
at least by

00:16:52.433 --> 00:16:53.533
my hand on the outside.

00:16:53.533 --> 00:16:58.000
If we had a proper sensor in
there, we could probably

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.633
measure, if it was a fast
response instrument, we could

00:17:01.633 --> 00:17:04.500
probably measure a several
degree drop.

00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:04.667
I'm guessing--

00:17:04.667 --> 00:17:05.867
I haven't done the
calculation.

00:17:05.867 --> 00:17:09.267
I'm guessing it would be three
or four degrees Celsius.

00:17:09.267 --> 00:17:12.333
I've got a little bit of
liquid water in here.

00:17:12.333 --> 00:17:15.367
So this air is pretty
humid to start with.

00:17:15.367 --> 00:17:15.433
Probably--

00:17:15.433 --> 00:17:18.667
I'm guessing the air in there
is probably 90% or 95%

00:17:18.667 --> 00:17:22.200
relative humidity, so I don't
have to cool it too much to

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:23.500
bring it to saturation.

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:25.833
But I doubt that
I can feel that

00:17:25.833 --> 00:17:26.933
temperature difference there.

00:17:26.933 --> 00:17:29.533
But there is one, but I think
it would have to have a good

00:17:29.533 --> 00:17:31.667
sensor inside to feel that.

00:17:31.667 --> 00:17:32.833
That's a good question though.

00:17:32.833 --> 00:17:35.767
Temperature is a key here, and
that part we can't see.

00:17:35.767 --> 00:17:39.333
We could only see the response
of the water vapor to that

00:17:39.333 --> 00:17:42.167
drop in temperature.

00:17:42.167 --> 00:17:42.533
Yes?

00:17:42.533 --> 00:17:44.367
STUDENT: Why do the particles
start swirling after

00:17:44.367 --> 00:17:45.867
you have the cloud?

00:17:45.867 --> 00:17:48.167
PROFESSOR: Well, when I suck
the air out of

00:17:48.167 --> 00:17:51.767
there, remember if I suck it
out, it's not going to come

00:17:51.767 --> 00:17:52.533
out smoothly.

00:17:52.533 --> 00:17:55.200
It's going to come out suddenly
in one region more

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:55.700
than another.

00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:58.833
And that's going to produce
some eddies in there just

00:17:58.833 --> 00:18:01.000
because I've suddenly
drawn air out of

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.167
one part of the chamber.

00:18:06.167 --> 00:18:06.967
So that's just leftover from--
it could also be a little bit

00:18:06.967 --> 00:18:08.233
because I'm heating it
from the bottom.

00:18:08.233 --> 00:18:10.700
It could be a little bit
of thermal convection.

00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:13.567
But I suspect it's mostly just
because I drew the air out

00:18:13.567 --> 00:18:19.067
very suddenly from one location
in the bottle.

00:18:19.067 --> 00:18:21.000
Anything else on that?

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:21.333
Yes?

00:18:21.333 --> 00:18:21.833
STUDENT: For the equation S
approximately 1 over lamda to

00:18:21.833 --> 00:18:22.100
the fourth, is that for all the
scattering or just for the

00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:23.333
Rayleigh scattering?

00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:33.967
PROFESSOR: That's just for
Rayleigh scattering.

00:18:33.967 --> 00:18:34.267
Yes.

00:18:34.267 --> 00:18:37.433
In fact, for Mie scattering,
you would write S is

00:18:37.433 --> 00:18:41.000
approximately independent
of wavelength.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:45.633
And for geometric optics, it's
more complicated because the

00:18:45.633 --> 00:18:49.100
ray is actually bouncing around
inside the raindrop and

00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:50.633
scattering in a different way.

00:18:50.633 --> 00:18:54.533
So that applies only to the
Rayleigh scattering.

00:18:54.533 --> 00:18:56.667
That's the property of-- that
is why the sky is blue when

00:18:56.667 --> 00:18:58.600
you scatter off very
small particles.

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:02.933
OK.

00:19:02.933 --> 00:19:06.467
Anything else on
the experiment?

00:19:06.467 --> 00:19:10.200
Now the subject that we have to
deal with today is how you

00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:14.933
take a cloud that is composed of
these tiny cloud droplets,

00:19:14.933 --> 00:19:19.600
10 microns in size, too small
to fall gravitationally and

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:22.933
occasionally get rain
out of these clouds.

00:19:22.933 --> 00:19:26.500
As I mentioned last time, if you
compare the diameter of a

00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:29.300
droplet to the diameter of a
raindrop, there's a factor of

00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:31.533
100 difference.

00:19:31.533 --> 00:19:34.900
Their volumes are different
by a factor of a million.

00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:38.200
That's 100 cubed, because the
volume of the sphere goes like

00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:40.700
the cube of the radius.

00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:44.300
So we'd have to bring together
a million cloud droplets to

00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:47.300
form one raindrop.

00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:50.000
How and under what
circumstances are

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:50.967
we going to do this?

00:19:50.967 --> 00:19:51.967
There are two theories.

00:19:51.967 --> 00:19:53.600
Your book is good in this.

00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:58.300
There are two outstanding
theories for this.

00:19:58.300 --> 00:19:59.800
The first one is called
collision-coalescence.

00:20:03.333 --> 00:20:08.500
If you have tiny cloud droplets,
but they're not all

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:12.367
the same size, some are a little
bit larger than others,

00:20:12.367 --> 00:20:14.100
they're not falling very fast.

00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:17.067
But the large one is going to be
falling a little bit faster

00:20:17.067 --> 00:20:19.667
than the smaller ones.

00:20:19.667 --> 00:20:22.167
And therefore, up in the cloud,
the larger ones are

00:20:22.167 --> 00:20:25.167
going to overtake the
smaller ones.

00:20:25.167 --> 00:20:30.867
And when they collide,
they may coalesce.

00:20:30.867 --> 00:20:31.433
They might not.

00:20:31.433 --> 00:20:32.533
They might bounce
off each other.

00:20:32.533 --> 00:20:35.633
But with some degree of
efficiency, they will coalesce

00:20:35.633 --> 00:20:38.133
and make a larger droplet.

00:20:38.133 --> 00:20:41.767
Well, now it's going to
fall even faster.

00:20:41.767 --> 00:20:45.033
And so it's going to sweep
up smaller droplets at an

00:20:45.033 --> 00:20:47.233
increasing rate.

00:20:47.233 --> 00:20:49.833
And before you know it, you
could sweep up a million

00:20:49.833 --> 00:20:52.133
droplets and form a raindrop.

00:20:52.133 --> 00:20:55.733
You may have seen something like
this on a cold winter day

00:20:55.733 --> 00:21:01.300
with droplets condensing inside
of your window at home.

00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:04.967
Sometimes a drop will start
to move down the window.

00:21:04.967 --> 00:21:08.033
And then as it collects up other
droplets, suddenly it

00:21:08.033 --> 00:21:10.000
will fall right to the
bottom of the window.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.567
That's kind of what I'm
talking about with

00:21:11.567 --> 00:21:13.600
collision-coalescence.

00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:17.800
It's not a very efficient
process most of the time,

00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:21.833
because these cloud droplets are
too similar to each other.

00:21:21.833 --> 00:21:25.500
There's not enough of a range of
large to small particles to

00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:26.233
get this going.

00:21:26.233 --> 00:21:31.800
But on occasion, especially
over tropical oceans, this

00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:33.733
mechanism is thought
to dominate.

00:21:36.967 --> 00:21:40.400
The other mechanism, a little
more complicated, so follow

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:42.433
this argument closely.

00:21:42.433 --> 00:21:46.800
It assumes that you have
supercooled water droplets,

00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:49.800
tiny droplets at a temperature
colder than

00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:53.767
zero degrees Celsius.

00:21:53.767 --> 00:21:55.133
It wants to freeze.

00:21:55.133 --> 00:21:56.600
It's cold enough to freeze.

00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:59.600
But it needs something to
trigger the freezing.

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:02.733
That's called a freezing
nucleus.

00:22:02.733 --> 00:22:07.400
Some little particle of dust
or some little speck of

00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:09.167
something or other that
would trigger

00:22:09.167 --> 00:22:10.267
one of those to freeze.

00:22:10.267 --> 00:22:15.167
So imagine you've got a cloud
with supercooled liquid water.

00:22:15.167 --> 00:22:17.800
And something makes
one of those

00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:19.500
droplets suddenly freeze.

00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:24.233
So I've drawn it now with a
six-sided shape indicating

00:22:24.233 --> 00:22:25.133
it's a ice crystal.

00:22:25.133 --> 00:22:31.033
It turns out, here's the key,
that ice at the same

00:22:31.033 --> 00:22:35.433
temperature as liquid water
has a slightly lower

00:22:35.433 --> 00:22:38.800
saturation vapor pressure.

00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:46.233
Ice and water at the same
temperature, the ice has a

00:22:46.233 --> 00:22:49.533
slightly lower saturation
water vapor pressure.

00:22:49.533 --> 00:22:53.400
That means that the ice is a
little more attractive to

00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:56.933
water vapor than
the liquid is.

00:22:56.933 --> 00:23:01.400
So I freeze one of
these droplets.

00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:04.333
And immediately, it starts
to draw water vapor

00:23:04.333 --> 00:23:07.967
towards it and grow.

00:23:07.967 --> 00:23:11.400
Meanwhile, the other droplets
begin to shrink because the

00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:16.400
humidity is decreasing around,
which starts to evaporate the

00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:17.800
cloud droplets that remain.

00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:29.067
So before long, this thing has
grown to be quite large

00:23:29.067 --> 00:23:34.167
through a vapor deposition
process, initially at least, a

00:23:34.167 --> 00:23:36.367
vapor deposition process.

00:23:36.367 --> 00:23:38.167
This is a snowflake.

00:23:38.167 --> 00:23:39.567
And now it's large.

00:23:39.567 --> 00:23:43.433
It will begin to fall out of
the sky and may reach the

00:23:43.433 --> 00:23:47.533
ground as a snowflake if the
temperature is warm enough.

00:23:47.533 --> 00:23:48.667
It may do other things.

00:23:48.667 --> 00:23:52.600
Once it starts to fall,
it may start to hit.

00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:54.800
It may kind of go back
to this mechanism.

00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:57.433
You might start to
hit some of these

00:23:57.433 --> 00:23:59.067
supercooled liquid droplets.

00:23:59.067 --> 00:24:02.033
And they will freeze
on impact.

00:24:02.033 --> 00:24:07.200
In which case, this will grow
further by riming, by having

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:09.500
supercooled droplets
hit, and stick, and

00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:11.467
freeze when they hit.

00:24:11.467 --> 00:24:16.667
Eventually, that could lead, for
example, to a hail stone,

00:24:16.667 --> 00:24:18.700
where you first form
a snowflake.

00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:22.667
And then as it falls out, you
would collect by riming more

00:24:22.667 --> 00:24:24.600
of these supercooled
water droplets.

00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:28.733
That would eventually produce
a hail stone.

00:24:28.733 --> 00:24:33.167
Any questions on this
ice phase mechanism?

00:24:33.167 --> 00:24:37.667
This is believed to be the
most common mechanism for

00:24:37.667 --> 00:24:40.533
producing rain and snow
around the world.

00:24:40.533 --> 00:24:44.800
In fact, the rain we had over
the weekend was almost

00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:48.200
certainly of this type.

00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:50.433
So most of the rain you've
experienced unless spent over

00:24:50.433 --> 00:24:52.933
the tropical oceans
has probably been

00:24:52.933 --> 00:24:55.033
formed in this way.

00:24:55.033 --> 00:24:55.367
Question?

00:24:55.367 --> 00:24:55.700
Yes?

00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:59.167
STUDENT: Why does the lower
saturation vapor pressure mean

00:24:59.167 --> 00:25:01.067
it attracts more water?

00:25:01.067 --> 00:25:04.600
PROFESSOR: So if you remember
the definition of

00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:10.000
saturation vapor pressure, if
I have a chamber with a

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:16.900
condensed phase there and the
vapor up here, saturation

00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:20.167
vapor pressure is a vapor
pressure that will exist here

00:25:20.167 --> 00:25:24.900
when you're in equilibrium
with the condensed vapor.

00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:32.567
So if I suddenly change this
from water to say ice, the ice

00:25:32.567 --> 00:25:36.033
is more attractive to the vapor
and will suck a little

00:25:36.033 --> 00:25:39.067
bit of that extra water vapor
out dropping this until the

00:25:39.067 --> 00:25:41.133
new equilibrium is reached.

00:25:41.133 --> 00:25:45.233
So I haven't given you a say
quantum mechanical explanation

00:25:45.233 --> 00:25:47.633
for why the vapor pressure
over ice is lower.

00:25:47.633 --> 00:25:49.700
But I've explained
what that means.

00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:52.133
I think that's the best I
can do at this stage.

00:25:54.900 --> 00:25:56.767
This is a trickier mechanism.

00:25:56.767 --> 00:26:00.300
So I'd be happy to take
questions on this if I haven't

00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:02.667
made this clear.

00:26:02.667 --> 00:26:05.233
It's called the ice phase
mechanism for

00:26:05.233 --> 00:26:07.633
generating rain and snow.

00:26:07.633 --> 00:26:12.033
Sometimes it's called the
Bergeron mechanism after the

00:26:12.033 --> 00:26:17.733
Norwegian scientist that
developed the idea.

00:26:17.733 --> 00:26:24.633
OK, now with that, then let's
talk about some different rain

00:26:24.633 --> 00:26:26.167
scenarios-- rain or
snow scenarios.

00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:34.067
If you have a shallow cloud,
it's warm at the surface.

00:26:34.067 --> 00:26:36.467
And you know somehow from
a balloon sounding or an

00:26:36.467 --> 00:26:42.467
aircraft pattern that the top
of that cloud is below the

00:26:42.467 --> 00:26:44.333
freezing level.

00:26:44.333 --> 00:26:46.833
That is the temperature is
greater than zero degrees

00:26:46.833 --> 00:26:50.333
Celsius below, less above,
but the cloud never

00:26:50.333 --> 00:26:51.700
reaches that height.

00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:52.933
And it's raining.

00:26:55.333 --> 00:26:59.200
A simple process of elimination
tells you that

00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:01.067
this must be the mechanism.

00:27:01.067 --> 00:27:02.700
It must be the
collision-coalescence

00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:05.233
mechanism, because there's
no supercooled

00:27:05.233 --> 00:27:06.167
liquid water in this.

00:27:06.167 --> 00:27:08.867
All the liquid water in the
cloud is at a temperature

00:27:08.867 --> 00:27:10.700
above zero degrees Celsius.

00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:14.300
So this mechanism is excluded.

00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:15.833
It must be a warm
rain mechanism.

00:27:18.833 --> 00:27:19.833
Let's go on to the next phase.

00:27:19.833 --> 00:27:23.400
Let's say this cloud
is taller now.

00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:25.733
And the zero degrees Celsius
line is there, meaning it's

00:27:25.733 --> 00:27:29.867
colder above and warmer below.

00:27:29.867 --> 00:27:33.367
There's a good section of this
cloud then that will have

00:27:33.367 --> 00:27:36.267
supercooled liquid
water in it.

00:27:36.267 --> 00:27:38.733
Probably what's happening, if
it's raining out the bottom of

00:27:38.733 --> 00:27:41.700
this cloud, it's probably
because the ice phase

00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:44.633
mechanism is working, producing
snowflakes up here.

00:27:44.633 --> 00:27:47.733
I've drawn my crude
little snowflake.

00:27:47.733 --> 00:27:52.033
I made the cardinal sin of
making it a five-pointed star

00:27:52.033 --> 00:27:54.767
when ice always has a
six-fold symmetry.

00:27:54.767 --> 00:27:57.067
So I hope you can do
better than that.

00:27:57.067 --> 00:27:58.467
You should put a Star
of David there.

00:27:58.467 --> 00:28:00.767
That would at least have
a six-fold symmetry.

00:28:03.333 --> 00:28:07.733
So snow is being produced
via this mechanism.

00:28:07.733 --> 00:28:09.000
Then it's falling out.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:12.100
As soon as it falls and reaches
the zero degrees

00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:18.267
Celsius line, it is going to
melt and become a raindrop.

00:28:18.267 --> 00:28:20.933
And then it'll fall as rain
all the way to the ground.

00:28:20.933 --> 00:28:24.233
So again, the rain we had this
weekend was almost certainly

00:28:24.233 --> 00:28:27.567
of that type formed as snow
higher in the atmosphere.

00:28:27.567 --> 00:28:30.500
And as it fell, it melted
and became a raindrop.

00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:32.367
And we felt it as rain.

00:28:32.367 --> 00:28:34.967
That's the most common situation
of all, by the way.

00:28:34.967 --> 00:28:39.033
This is extremely common, at
least here in New Haven.

00:28:39.033 --> 00:28:42.767
In the winter time, if you had
temperatures less than zero

00:28:42.767 --> 00:28:46.400
degrees Celsius everywhere, if
it was cold at the surface,

00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:50.733
and of course, even colder aloft
in the troposphere, you

00:28:50.733 --> 00:28:54.267
could have the ice phase process
forming snowflakes.

00:28:54.267 --> 00:28:57.600
And then they would simply fall
all the way to the ground

00:28:57.600 --> 00:28:59.467
as a snowflake.

00:28:59.467 --> 00:29:00.800
That's fine.

00:29:03.233 --> 00:29:06.033
Occasionally, you may have
encountered situations, or you

00:29:06.033 --> 00:29:10.833
will this winter if you keep
your eyes open, where the

00:29:10.833 --> 00:29:14.233
temperature at the surface is
almost exactly zero Celsius,

00:29:14.233 --> 00:29:16.800
within two or three degrees
of zero Celsius.

00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:21.667
So that melting level is right
about at the surface.

00:29:21.667 --> 00:29:29.367
What you'll find then is that
the snow that's falling is wet

00:29:29.367 --> 00:29:31.467
and sticky.

00:29:31.467 --> 00:29:35.300
Because it's actually begun its
melting process in just

00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:39.367
the last few seconds as
it's fallen to Earth.

00:29:39.367 --> 00:29:44.333
But that'd be the special case
somewhere just between these

00:29:44.333 --> 00:29:48.600
two where the zero line-- zero
degrees Celsius is just about

00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:51.967
at the surface of the Earth.

00:29:51.967 --> 00:29:53.933
Questions on these
scenarios so far?

00:29:56.600 --> 00:29:57.033
OK.

00:29:57.033 --> 00:30:01.100
Now here's one that's a little
less common but can be quite

00:30:01.100 --> 00:30:02.900
important when it happens.

00:30:02.900 --> 00:30:05.300
It's called an ice storm.

00:30:05.300 --> 00:30:07.767
And you have to imagine a
temperature profile like I've

00:30:07.767 --> 00:30:08.700
drawn here.

00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:11.133
The vertical line for reference
is the zero degrees

00:30:11.133 --> 00:30:13.700
Celsius line.

00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:19.133
So there's a zero line aloft but
another zero line close to

00:30:19.133 --> 00:30:19.700
the surface.

00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:23.333
In other words, cold,
warm, and cold

00:30:23.333 --> 00:30:24.533
again near the surface.

00:30:24.533 --> 00:30:25.567
So what's going to happen?

00:30:25.567 --> 00:30:29.100
Well, up here it's going to
be just like this one.

00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:31.433
You're going to have the ice
phase mechanism producing

00:30:31.433 --> 00:30:33.900
snowflakes.

00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:35.100
They're going to
melt and become

00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:38.633
raindrops below that line.

00:30:38.633 --> 00:30:43.967
Now they are falling to Earth as
a raindrop, a liquid drop.

00:30:43.967 --> 00:30:47.467
But then in the last few hundred
meters before they hit

00:30:47.467 --> 00:30:52.967
the surface, they enter
a cold layer of air.

00:30:52.967 --> 00:30:57.767
That air is going to cool down
the droplet, probably even

00:30:57.767 --> 00:30:59.800
below the freezing mark.

00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:04.633
If that air temperature is say
minus five Celsius, then it's

00:31:04.633 --> 00:31:06.833
going to cool down that droplet
to about that same

00:31:06.833 --> 00:31:09.167
temperature, minus
five Celsius.

00:31:09.167 --> 00:31:10.833
So now what do you have?

00:31:10.833 --> 00:31:12.800
The first time I mention
this, but you now have

00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:15.900
a supercooled raindrop.

00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:18.767
Before I was talking about
supercooled cloud droplets.

00:31:18.767 --> 00:31:20.100
Now I'm talking about a
supercooled raindrop.

00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:22.900
It's a millimeter in size.

00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:25.233
But it's supercooled.

00:31:25.233 --> 00:31:28.533
That is going to freeze
upon impact and coat

00:31:28.533 --> 00:31:30.733
everything with ice.

00:31:30.733 --> 00:31:33.867
The power lines are going to be
drooping with the weight.

00:31:33.867 --> 00:31:36.200
The branches on the trees are
going to be leaning and

00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:44.167
breaking over the weight of that
ice freezing on impact as

00:31:44.167 --> 00:31:46.733
those supercooled raindrops
hit the--

00:31:46.733 --> 00:31:48.067
STUDENT: So they're raindrops?

00:31:48.067 --> 00:31:49.833
PROFESSOR: Supercooled
raindrops.

00:31:49.833 --> 00:31:50.633
Right.

00:31:50.633 --> 00:31:53.633
This is called freezing
rain or an ice storm.

00:31:53.633 --> 00:31:56.433
And the damage is caused
normally--

00:31:56.433 --> 00:31:58.367
well, of course, the roads are
going to be dangerous too

00:31:58.367 --> 00:32:00.200
because the roads
would be icy.

00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:04.133
But most of the damage is going
to come, I think, from

00:32:04.133 --> 00:32:09.533
the weight of this on trees,
and power lines, and so on,

00:32:09.533 --> 00:32:10.800
occasionally breaking
them, making

00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:14.033
them come to the surface.

00:32:14.033 --> 00:32:17.833
But for that, you need this
special behavior of the air

00:32:17.833 --> 00:32:19.600
temperature.

00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:24.467
Which around New England, you
typically get once or twice

00:32:24.467 --> 00:32:29.533
each winter, you'll get an ice
storm that has this particular

00:32:29.533 --> 00:32:32.333
behavior to it.

00:32:32.333 --> 00:32:33.800
Any questions on that?

00:32:38.567 --> 00:32:43.000
Well, I can probably
then say a few

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:47.933
words about cloud seeding.

00:32:47.933 --> 00:32:51.467
Cloud seeding is an attempt
to get clouds that are not

00:32:51.467 --> 00:32:52.667
raining to rain.

00:32:52.667 --> 00:32:58.000
You can imagine the frustration
of a farmer who

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:02.400
finds his crops withering
for lack of rain.

00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:06.667
And yet all these clouds are
passing by overhead with lots

00:33:06.667 --> 00:33:07.633
of condensed water.

00:33:07.633 --> 00:33:11.300
But it's all in the cloud
droplet form.

00:33:11.300 --> 00:33:13.233
Raindrops are not forming.

00:33:13.233 --> 00:33:18.467
He would give anything if he
could just get this process--

00:33:18.467 --> 00:33:21.200
one of these two processes
to work, the

00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:23.033
collision-coalescence or
the ice phase process.

00:33:25.533 --> 00:33:32.167
If the cloud has supercooled
water, he might have a chance.

00:33:32.167 --> 00:33:33.400
And this is the way you do it.

00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:37.500
You inject into the cloud
some freezing nuclei.

00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:41.900
You want to get a few of these
droplets to freeze.

00:33:41.900 --> 00:33:46.333
And a good freezing nuclei would
be a compound called

00:33:46.333 --> 00:33:48.267
silver iodide.

00:33:48.267 --> 00:33:51.200
AgI is the chemical
formula for it.

00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:53.600
Because it has a crystal
structure very much

00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:55.600
like that of ice.

00:33:55.600 --> 00:34:01.100
And so if a particle of silver
iodide hits a supercooled

00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:04.400
cloud droplet, it is likely
to cause it to freeze.

00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:07.100
And then this process
could start.

00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:13.133
So there is a big industry
today in cloud

00:34:13.133 --> 00:34:16.100
seeding of cold clouds.

00:34:16.100 --> 00:34:20.333
I don't know if I forgot to
mention it, but a cloud which

00:34:20.333 --> 00:34:23.967
has no part of it at a
temperature below freezing is

00:34:23.967 --> 00:34:27.833
often called a warm cloud.

00:34:27.833 --> 00:34:30.000
Well, that's not going
to work for silver

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:30.900
iodide cloud seeding.

00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:33.667
You need to have supercooled
water in that

00:34:33.667 --> 00:34:34.767
cloud for it to work.

00:34:34.767 --> 00:34:37.767
It would have to be something
like this.

00:34:37.767 --> 00:34:40.533
In that case, you inject the
silver iodide either from the

00:34:40.533 --> 00:34:44.033
ground, or from an aircraft,
or from a rocket.

00:34:44.033 --> 00:34:47.600
And you hope that you're
putting in just

00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:48.867
enough and not too much.

00:34:48.867 --> 00:34:50.600
What happens if you
put in too much?

00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:54.700
If you put in too much, you're
going to freeze a large number

00:34:54.700 --> 00:34:57.367
of cloud droplets.

00:34:57.367 --> 00:35:00.767
And they're all going to be
competing for the same water.

00:35:00.767 --> 00:35:02.433
So they're not going to grow.

00:35:02.433 --> 00:35:07.933
So on average, you have to
freeze about one in a million.

00:35:07.933 --> 00:35:10.833
To make this most effective, you
want to freeze about one

00:35:10.833 --> 00:35:13.567
in a million of the
cloud droplets.

00:35:13.567 --> 00:35:16.267
Then you would get a million
cloud droplets contributing to

00:35:16.267 --> 00:35:17.333
one snowflake.

00:35:17.333 --> 00:35:19.633
That would be ideal.

00:35:19.633 --> 00:35:25.300
This is a bit of a dirty subject
though because there

00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:28.167
is a lot of people doing this,
a lot of cash being handed

00:35:28.167 --> 00:35:31.467
around and hopeful farmers
paying for this.

00:35:31.467 --> 00:35:34.933
But the scientific, and I
should say statistical

00:35:34.933 --> 00:35:39.800
evidence that this works
is not so clear.

00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:44.100
And the National Science
Foundation has stopped funding

00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:48.933
most research on cloud seeding
because the people who were

00:35:48.933 --> 00:35:51.733
doing that work were not
maintaining the highest

00:35:51.733 --> 00:35:58.833
standards of statistical
verification of their work.

00:35:58.833 --> 00:36:04.100
The problem is if you seed a
cloud, and it rains, how do

00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:07.833
you know that it wasn't
going to rain anyway?

00:36:07.833 --> 00:36:09.333
That's the big problem.

00:36:09.333 --> 00:36:12.100
So in order to do this properly,
you would have to

00:36:12.100 --> 00:36:21.800
seed perhaps 1,000 clouds,
half with a placebo.

00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:25.433
You do a blind test. Because if
you allow the people that

00:36:25.433 --> 00:36:28.567
are doing the seeding to pick
the clouds they're going to

00:36:28.567 --> 00:36:31.167
seed, they may pick the
clouds that look most

00:36:31.167 --> 00:36:33.333
likely to rain anyway.

00:36:33.333 --> 00:36:35.567
So you really need to maintain
very high standards of

00:36:35.567 --> 00:36:38.400
statistical verification
on this.

00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:40.833
And in the early days,
this was not done.

00:36:40.833 --> 00:36:43.100
The field is beginning to come
back now with a little higher

00:36:43.100 --> 00:36:47.667
level of statistical
verification and beginning to

00:36:47.667 --> 00:36:50.400
become acceptable again
scientifically.

00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:53.433
But as I say, there's still
a big industry.

00:36:53.433 --> 00:36:56.433
For example, every year, seeding
all along the Sierra

00:36:56.433 --> 00:36:59.400
Nevada range in California is
done, and the claim is that

00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:04.567
has been increasing the
snow pack every year.

00:37:04.567 --> 00:37:11.100
Even in the tropics, there is an
industry claiming that they

00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:14.167
can seed warm clouds.

00:37:14.167 --> 00:37:18.400
This is even less likely
to be the case.

00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:22.433
First of all, silver iodide
wouldn't work.

00:37:22.433 --> 00:37:23.267
You'd have to have something
else-- in this case, you'd be

00:37:23.267 --> 00:37:25.867
trying to enhance this mechanism
because it's the

00:37:25.867 --> 00:37:28.533
only one that could work
for a warm cloud.

00:37:28.533 --> 00:37:34.133
And the way you would do that
would be perhaps to drop some

00:37:34.133 --> 00:37:39.500
kind of hydroscopic nuclei into
it, like a salt particle,

00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:40.567
for example.

00:37:40.567 --> 00:37:44.033
Salt likes to pick up water.

00:37:44.033 --> 00:37:47.267
And if you could drop some salt
crystals in there, you

00:37:47.267 --> 00:37:49.667
might be able to produce some
droplets that are a little bit

00:37:49.667 --> 00:37:51.800
larger than the others.

00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:53.100
And that would enhance the

00:37:53.100 --> 00:37:55.700
collision-coalescence mechanism.

00:37:55.700 --> 00:37:58.700
But as I say, this is even
less further along as a

00:37:58.700 --> 00:38:02.767
scientific development than is
the seeding of cold clouds.

00:38:02.767 --> 00:38:03.200
Question?

00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:03.600
Yes?

00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:05.033
STUDENT: Are there any
environmental concerns,

00:38:05.033 --> 00:38:07.367
putting silver iodide in-- ?

00:38:07.367 --> 00:38:08.667
PROFESSOR: The question is
are there are

00:38:08.667 --> 00:38:09.733
environmental concerns?

00:38:09.733 --> 00:38:12.367
Well, yeah, that's been
discussed widely.

00:38:12.367 --> 00:38:16.567
Silver iodide, I think the
saving thing here is that you

00:38:16.567 --> 00:38:18.133
don't want to put very
much in anyway.

00:38:18.133 --> 00:38:21.100
So you only put a small amount
of silver iodide in.

00:38:21.100 --> 00:38:23.133
And there has been though--

00:38:23.133 --> 00:38:27.367
people have been able to find
the remains of this in the

00:38:27.367 --> 00:38:28.633
environment.

00:38:28.633 --> 00:38:31.300
But as far as I know, silver
iodide is not a particularly

00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:33.067
dangerous compound.

00:38:33.067 --> 00:38:34.300
But do a check for yourself.

00:38:34.300 --> 00:38:36.133
Just Google silver iodide.

00:38:36.133 --> 00:38:38.400
AgI is the chemical formula.

00:38:42.233 --> 00:38:43.933
And see if it has any-- as far
as I know, except for recent

00:38:43.933 --> 00:38:46.133
literature, I haven't followed,
there been no

00:38:46.133 --> 00:38:47.967
environmental problems
detected for that.

00:38:47.967 --> 00:38:52.700
But that's a good question
worth looking into.

00:38:52.700 --> 00:38:56.200
Other questions on rain?

00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:56.600
Yes?

00:38:56.600 --> 00:38:57.167
STUDENT: I guess the
semi-legendary old belief that

00:38:57.167 --> 00:38:57.433
if you fired canons it would
cause rain, does that have any

00:38:57.433 --> 00:38:58.667
basis in reality?

00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:06.567
PROFESSOR: Not that I know of.

00:39:06.567 --> 00:39:08.933
I've heard that as well.

00:39:08.933 --> 00:39:11.400
Firing cannons was hoping
to trigger this.

00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:13.000
I don't think there's
any scientific

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:14.800
evidence that that works.

00:39:18.967 --> 00:39:21.267
Anything else on this?

00:39:21.267 --> 00:39:21.600
OK.

00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:24.933
So what are we looking for
in terms of climatology?

00:39:24.933 --> 00:39:28.200
A given region of the Earth will
have certain water vapor

00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:30.400
sources, nearby bodies
of water.

00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:32.333
It will have certain
characteristics that might

00:39:32.333 --> 00:39:34.867
make air rise.

00:39:34.867 --> 00:39:36.700
If you get the right conditions,
you might get

00:39:36.700 --> 00:39:38.067
precipitation.

00:39:38.067 --> 00:39:40.433
But this will vary from place
to place around the world.

00:39:40.433 --> 00:39:43.900
We'll talk about the global
climatology of rainfall in

00:39:43.900 --> 00:39:44.733
just a few days.

00:39:44.733 --> 00:39:47.267
But there are some regions
of the Earth

00:39:47.267 --> 00:39:50.033
where it never rains.

00:39:50.033 --> 00:39:51.033
Why would that be?

00:39:51.033 --> 00:39:54.067
Why would there be a place on
Earth where it never rains?

00:39:54.067 --> 00:39:55.300
Anybody have an idea?

00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:01.167
STUDENT: If it's like right
after a big mountain range,

00:40:01.167 --> 00:40:03.167
that like a cloud would
have to lose all its

00:40:03.167 --> 00:40:04.767
water to pass over?

00:40:04.767 --> 00:40:07.700
PROFESSOR: Yeah, that would
be possible.

00:40:07.700 --> 00:40:10.633
But I think, even in that
scenario, I would offer a

00:40:10.633 --> 00:40:12.500
slightly different
explanation.

00:40:12.500 --> 00:40:14.167
And that is if you have a
mountain range, and the wind

00:40:14.167 --> 00:40:17.567
is always from one side towards
the other, you'd have

00:40:17.567 --> 00:40:19.400
rising motion on one side
which would give you

00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:22.500
precipitation, but then
always sinking motion

00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:23.433
on the other side.

00:40:23.433 --> 00:40:26.867
So even if you hadn't rained
out all the water, once you

00:40:26.867 --> 00:40:29.833
start the air descending,
then you see you

00:40:29.833 --> 00:40:31.967
clear out the clouds.

00:40:31.967 --> 00:40:36.400
So I would like to take that
option because I think it's

00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:37.433
more universal.

00:40:37.433 --> 00:40:40.900
Wherever you have on the globe,
a place where the air

00:40:40.900 --> 00:40:45.433
is usually descending for
whatever reason, you're

00:40:45.433 --> 00:40:49.767
unlikely to form either clouds
or precipitation.

00:40:49.767 --> 00:40:52.233
Wherever you have regions
where the air is often

00:40:52.233 --> 00:40:58.800
ascending, then you are much
more likely to have clouds or

00:40:58.800 --> 00:40:59.800
precipitation.

00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:03.200
There are people that say,
well, we could make the

00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:08.000
deserts bloom by just adding
more water vapor.

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:11.500
And that will not work, because
I don't care how much

00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:13.167
water vapor you add
to the atmosphere.

00:41:13.167 --> 00:41:16.433
If the air is always going to be
descending, for example, in

00:41:16.433 --> 00:41:19.267
the Sahara Desert, what makes
the Sahara Desert a desert is

00:41:19.267 --> 00:41:21.733
that the air there is
usually descending.

00:41:21.733 --> 00:41:24.567
Adding water vapor, that's
not going to change it.

00:41:24.567 --> 00:41:25.800
The air is still going
to be descending.

00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:27.867
You're not going
to make clouds.

00:41:27.867 --> 00:41:33.000
So precipitation climatology
usually has to do with where's

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:35.800
the air going up and where's
the air going down.

00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:37.100
It's complicated in many ways.

00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:41.067
But in that sense, it's very,
very simple, rising air versus

00:41:41.067 --> 00:41:41.633
descending air.

00:41:41.633 --> 00:41:48.500
Now a few numbers just to
put this in your mind.

00:41:48.500 --> 00:41:51.533
We don't know exactly what part
of the Earth gets the

00:41:51.533 --> 00:41:53.233
absolute most rainfall.

00:41:53.233 --> 00:41:58.467
But we suspect that there are
places on Earth that get as

00:41:58.467 --> 00:42:03.367
much as say 10 meters
of rain per year.

00:42:03.367 --> 00:42:06.400
I did a project in the Caribbean
last spring.

00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:09.000
And at the top of a mountainous
island down there,

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:11.333
we had a rain gauge installed
for several years.

00:42:11.333 --> 00:42:15.400
And at that point, we got six
meters of rainfall per year,

00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:17.800
which is a lot.

00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:23.133
Here in New haven, the average
annual rainfall is about 1.5

00:42:23.133 --> 00:42:28.433
meters, about that much rain
per year on average.

00:42:28.433 --> 00:42:34.733
In order to do rain-fed
agriculture, not irrigated

00:42:34.733 --> 00:42:38.767
agriculture, but rain-fed
agriculture, you need about 20

00:42:38.767 --> 00:42:43.233
centimeters of rain per year,
about that much rain per year.

00:42:43.233 --> 00:42:45.600
This will give you some idea
what kind of numbers we are

00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:48.433
looking for when we try to
understand rainfall around the

00:42:48.433 --> 00:42:51.067
globe, 20 centimeters about
what you need to do.

00:42:51.067 --> 00:42:53.533
And it's marginal.

00:42:53.533 --> 00:42:56.933
But that will allow you to do
a little bit of rain-fed

00:42:56.933 --> 00:42:59.433
agriculture.

00:42:59.433 --> 00:43:00.733
Questions on this?

00:43:04.833 --> 00:43:05.133
OK.

00:43:05.133 --> 00:43:09.400
We have just about enough time
for me to mention the other

00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:13.500
side of this, and that
is evaporation.

00:43:13.500 --> 00:43:17.867
If we now understand what makes
it rain, then we have to

00:43:17.867 --> 00:43:21.433
understand how that water gets
back into the atmosphere to

00:43:21.433 --> 00:43:24.933
balance the water budget of the
atmosphere, so just a word

00:43:24.933 --> 00:43:26.133
about evaporation.

00:43:26.133 --> 00:43:31.800
For the most part, the rate of
evaporation, well, it may

00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:35.467
depend on many things, like wind
speed over the surface

00:43:35.467 --> 00:43:40.233
and the humidity of the air.

00:43:40.233 --> 00:43:42.433
But the most important thing
it depends on is the

00:43:42.433 --> 00:43:45.833
availability of heat.

00:43:45.833 --> 00:43:48.133
If you don't have enough heat
available, you're not going to

00:43:48.133 --> 00:43:49.367
be able to evaporate water.

00:43:49.367 --> 00:43:50.233
Why is that?

00:43:50.233 --> 00:43:53.233
Because remember, the latent
heat of condensation

00:43:53.233 --> 00:43:58.067
evaporation is a very large
number, more than a million

00:43:58.067 --> 00:44:03.667
joules of heat required
to evaporate

00:44:03.667 --> 00:44:07.833
every kilogram of water.

00:44:07.833 --> 00:44:13.933
So if you tried to evaporate
water without plenty of heat

00:44:13.933 --> 00:44:17.433
available, you'll quickly cool
that water down and the

00:44:17.433 --> 00:44:19.100
evaporation will cease.

00:44:19.100 --> 00:44:23.567
In order to sustain hour after
hour evaporation, you've got

00:44:23.567 --> 00:44:24.467
to have a supply of heat.

00:44:24.467 --> 00:44:27.300
And that largely depends
on the air temperature.

00:44:27.300 --> 00:44:31.167
So of all the possible controls
that might be going

00:44:31.167 --> 00:44:33.467
on with evaporation, air
temperature is the most

00:44:33.467 --> 00:44:35.867
important one.

00:44:35.867 --> 00:44:41.467
I've put together a crude
empirical formula.

00:44:41.467 --> 00:44:45.700
I wouldn't use this if I had
to do a very accurate

00:44:45.700 --> 00:44:46.433
calculation.

00:44:46.433 --> 00:44:50.867
But I use it all the time for
quick back-of-the-envelope

00:44:50.867 --> 00:44:53.200
estimates of how much
evaporation

00:44:53.200 --> 00:44:54.433
is likely to occur.

00:44:54.433 --> 00:44:55.467
And here's the formula.

00:44:55.467 --> 00:44:59.800
Now PET means potential
evapotranspiration.

00:45:03.033 --> 00:45:06.633
Evapotranspiration combines
the words evaporation and

00:45:06.633 --> 00:45:11.000
transpiration, which means it
includes both evaporation from

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:12.833
water surfaces and

00:45:12.833 --> 00:45:16.567
transpiration from leaf
surfaces.

00:45:16.567 --> 00:45:20.933
Leaves are very effective
evaporating agents.

00:45:20.933 --> 00:45:24.100
Trees bring water up from the
ground in their roots.

00:45:24.100 --> 00:45:28.333
And then in the leaves, there
are small pores that allow

00:45:28.333 --> 00:45:31.033
that water to escape into
the atmosphere.

00:45:31.033 --> 00:45:34.567
So we combine that, evaporation
and transpiration,

00:45:34.567 --> 00:45:35.967
and call it ET.

00:45:35.967 --> 00:45:38.333
But now this is the potential
evapotranspiration.

00:45:38.333 --> 00:45:41.167
Because I want to remind you
that if you don't have water

00:45:41.167 --> 00:45:44.967
there to begin with, you
can't evaporate it.

00:45:44.967 --> 00:45:47.567
So potential evapotranspiration
is the

00:45:47.567 --> 00:45:51.600
evaporation rate you will have
if there is water present.

00:45:55.933 --> 00:45:56.067
If there is water present.

00:45:56.067 --> 00:46:01.800
And here's the formula, 5.7, a
constant that I've developed,

00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:05.800
times the temperature expressed
in degrees Celsius,

00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:08.467
if you want millimeters
per month.

00:46:08.467 --> 00:46:11.400
If you want millimeters per day,
just divide that by 30.

00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:16.500
And you get 0.17 millimeters
per day per degrees Celsius

00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:19.833
multiplied by the temperature
in Celsius.

00:46:19.833 --> 00:46:20.800
Let's do a quick example.

00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:26.800
Let's say the average
temperature today is going to

00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:30.333
be 20 degrees Celsius.

00:46:30.333 --> 00:46:36.700
So 20 degrees Celsius there,
multiply that times 20.

00:46:36.700 --> 00:46:37.800
And what do you get?

00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:44.900
You get about four millimeters
of evaporation.

00:46:44.900 --> 00:46:47.667
So my prediction today if the
average temperature is 20

00:46:47.667 --> 00:46:50.600
degrees, that you would get
four millimeters of

00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:54.433
evaporation from the
New Haven region.

00:46:54.433 --> 00:46:57.600
Part of it would come from
puddles of water, part of it

00:46:57.600 --> 00:47:00.467
would come from leaves,
part from grass.

00:47:00.467 --> 00:47:03.400
But on average with a
temperature of 20 degrees

00:47:03.400 --> 00:47:08.000
Celsius, you get about two
millimeters of evaporated

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:12.767
water, water going from liquid
into vapor during the day.

00:47:12.767 --> 00:47:15.333
Are there any questions
on that?

00:47:15.333 --> 00:47:15.833
Yeah?

00:47:15.833 --> 00:47:19.767
STUDENT: Does that considered
the relative humidity of--

00:47:19.767 --> 00:47:20.533
PROFESSOR: No.

00:47:20.533 --> 00:47:26.233
So I've neglected a few effects
that are rather

00:47:26.233 --> 00:47:29.133
important as well, such
as relative humidity.

00:47:29.133 --> 00:47:32.933
If the air is drier, it'll
evaporate more quickly.

00:47:32.933 --> 00:47:38.400
If the wind is blowing strong,
it'll evaporate more quickly.

00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:40.167
So I have neglected that.

00:47:40.167 --> 00:47:44.600
And you should make a note about
that, that this is not a

00:47:44.600 --> 00:47:48.533
very accurate method for doing
it because it's ignored such

00:47:48.533 --> 00:47:50.367
factors as the one that
was just mentioned.

00:47:53.233 --> 00:47:54.767
But I often use it-- when I know
what the precipitation is

00:47:54.767 --> 00:47:59.133
for some part of the world, and
I want to know if that's

00:47:59.133 --> 00:48:02.533
matched by evaporation, I'll do
a quick estimate of this,

00:48:02.533 --> 00:48:04.067
compare with what I
know about that.

00:48:04.067 --> 00:48:07.500
And that's usually the most
important aridity index.

00:48:07.500 --> 00:48:10.367
To know how much it rains
is not sufficient.

00:48:10.367 --> 00:48:13.533
To know whether a climate is
going to be wet or dry, you

00:48:13.533 --> 00:48:16.133
need to compare the
precipitation with the

00:48:16.133 --> 00:48:18.800
potential evapotranspiration.

00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:22.000
It's only in that comparison
that you get

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:22.700
a reasonable number.

00:48:22.700 --> 00:48:27.067
For example, in the high
latitudes, up in Northern

00:48:27.067 --> 00:48:31.133
Canada, for example, it
rains very little.

00:48:31.133 --> 00:48:33.100
But yet, it's a very
wet climate--

00:48:33.100 --> 00:48:36.933
mud, puddles of water
everywhere.

00:48:36.933 --> 00:48:38.533
How can that be if it
rains so little?

00:48:38.533 --> 00:48:41.833
Well, it's cold, and
therefore, the

00:48:41.833 --> 00:48:43.433
evaporation is even less.

00:48:43.433 --> 00:48:48.733
So a wet climate is one that
has more precipitation than

00:48:48.733 --> 00:48:49.900
evapotranspiration.

00:48:49.900 --> 00:48:52.067
A dry climate is the
reverse of that.

00:48:52.067 --> 00:48:54.967
You always must be comparing the
two when you're deciding

00:48:54.967 --> 00:48:57.667
whether a climate
is wet or dry.

00:48:57.667 --> 00:48:58.633
We're out of time.

00:48:58.633 --> 00:49:00.700
We'll continue this
on Wednesday.

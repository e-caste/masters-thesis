00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:03.590
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Last time,

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:07.595
I wrote down the Schwarzschild
metric, which was the sort of

00:00:07.595 --> 00:00:11.736
culmination of the theoretical
part of the--of this section of

00:00:11.736 --> 00:00:14.071
the course.
And I realized,

00:00:14.071 --> 00:00:18.719
as I was talking to some of you
afterwards about some of the

00:00:18.719 --> 00:00:22.399
implications of this,
that the way I--one of the ways

00:00:22.399 --> 00:00:25.920
in which I wrote it down might
have been a little confusing.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.390
So, let me write it down again
and I'll say a couple things.

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:36.385
And what I'm going to do is I'm
going to write it down with a

00:00:36.385 --> 00:00:41.215
little r instead of a
capital R and I'll tell

00:00:41.215 --> 00:00:44.980
you why in just a minute.
Obviously, it doesn't matter.

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:46.640
I've just changed the notation
slightly.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.611
And the reason I want to do
this is because I want to

00:01:00.611 --> 00:01:04.033
emphasize that this r,
the little r,

00:01:04.033 --> 00:01:06.689
what I've now written down as a
little r in this

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.880
equation,
is not the radius of the object;

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.080
r is just a coordinate.

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.253
It can be anything.
It's not the radius of the

00:01:20.253 --> 00:01:23.814
object for which the mass is
giving you the Schwarzschild

00:01:23.814 --> 00:01:26.843
radius.
The Schwarzschild radius is a

00:01:26.843 --> 00:01:30.891
very specific radius.
r_s =

00:01:30.891 --> 00:01:36.470
2GM / c^(2) so
that's a specific number.

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.648
The little r, here,
is just a coordinate and so is

00:01:40.648 --> 00:01:44.900
φ and θ, which combine into
this thing which I've called

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.989
Omega [Ω]
and T.

00:01:46.989 --> 00:01:53.154
And so if you have an object of
mass M and radius--I'll

00:01:53.154 --> 00:01:58.004
give--I'll call that
R_0 just to

00:01:58.004 --> 00:02:03.966
make sure that you understand
that this is the radius of the

00:02:03.966 --> 00:02:05.280
object.

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:13.330
The radius of the object
doesn't come into this metric.

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.727
The mass does,
because the mass turns into the

00:02:16.727 --> 00:02:20.879
Schwarzschild radius and that's
part of the equation.

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:23.740
But the radius of the object
doesn't matter.

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.479
And so, if you then ask,
well, what is a black hole?

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:31.824
A black hole is something in
which the radius of the object

00:02:31.824 --> 00:02:35.509
is less than the Schwarzschild
radius.

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:39.990
Because if that's true,
then there is some coordinate

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:44.556
r, some little r
where little r =

00:02:44.556 --> 00:02:47.995
R_S.
And then, if you go up into

00:02:47.995 --> 00:02:50.994
these equations here very--these
very strange things happen when

00:02:50.994 --> 00:02:53.470
little r is equal to
R_S.

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.578
Yes, question?
Student: Yesterday,

00:02:55.578 --> 00:02:57.931
the big group had [Inaudible]
Professor Charles

00:02:57.931 --> 00:02:59.880
Bailyn: Oh you're right,
you're right,

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.509
it has to be the other way
around, I'm sorry.

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:03.261
Student: [Inaudible]
Professor Charles

00:03:03.261 --> 00:03:04.639
Bailyn: This has to be
squared.

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:06.610
You're right on both counts,
good.

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:12.361
R_S / r.
Yes, it better be that way

00:03:12.361 --> 00:03:15.482
because R_S /
r in the normal part of

00:03:15.482 --> 00:03:17.650
space is less than 1.
So, thank you very much,

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:18.340
sorry about that.

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:24.470
Okay, I think we're all right.
Are we all right?

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.082
Yeah, good.
Okay, so there is some r

00:03:29.082 --> 00:03:31.677
where r is equal to
R_S,

00:03:31.677 --> 00:03:34.660
and then these very bizarre
things start to happen.

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.852
If R_0,
the radius of the actual

00:03:37.852 --> 00:03:40.977
object, is bigger than its
Schwarzschild radius,

00:03:40.977 --> 00:03:44.736
then that isn't true.
There's no r where

00:03:44.736 --> 00:03:48.847
r is equal to
R_S--then no

00:03:48.847 --> 00:03:52.370
r equal to
R_S.

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.276
Now, you might think that
somewhere inside the object,

00:03:55.276 --> 00:03:58.238
there would be a little
r, which is equal to the

00:03:58.238 --> 00:04:01.623
Schwarzschild radius.
But that isn't--that turns out

00:04:01.623 --> 00:04:05.180
not to be right either,
because the relevant M,

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.334
the relevant mass-
Student: Can you lower

00:04:08.334 --> 00:04:10.097
the top slide?
Professor Charles

00:04:10.097 --> 00:04:13.715
Bailyn: Oh sure.
Student: The whole--the

00:04:13.715 --> 00:04:19.511
slide not the - Professor
Charles Bailyn: Oh yeah,

00:04:19.511 --> 00:04:21.430
okay.
So, yeah.

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:30.402
Let me put this back.
The relevant mass is the mass

00:04:30.402 --> 00:04:35.845
inside r.
So if you're--if you've got

00:04:35.845 --> 00:04:39.412
some mass M,
like this, and you're outside,

00:04:39.412 --> 00:04:42.396
if you're here,
then the whole of the mass

00:04:42.396 --> 00:04:45.167
counts.
But if you're sitting inside

00:04:45.167 --> 00:04:49.370
this thing, then the only mass
that counts is this mass here.

00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:59.404
And so, for r--for
coordinates for positions inside

00:04:59.404 --> 00:05:04.832
the object, then the relevant
mass that you put into the

00:05:04.832 --> 00:05:10.260
equation is less than the mass
of the whole object.

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.813
And the consequence of that is
that, as you go further and

00:05:21.813 --> 00:05:24.911
further inside the thing,
the mass becomes less and less,

00:05:24.911 --> 00:05:28.269
and the Schwarzschild radius
becomes less and less.

00:05:28.269 --> 00:05:33.797
And so, if the total size of
the object is greater than the

00:05:33.797 --> 00:05:38.507
Schwarzschild radius,
then there is no position

00:05:38.507 --> 00:05:44.750
inside the thing which is less
than the Schwarzschild radius,

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:47.565
because the relevant mass
decreases, and so does the

00:05:47.565 --> 00:05:50.712
Schwarzschild radius as you go
in toward the center of the

00:05:50.712 --> 00:05:54.387
object.
So, I just wanted to make sure

00:05:54.387 --> 00:06:00.011
you understood that the key to
using this metric is that

00:06:00.011 --> 00:06:05.839
the--this r term in it
tells you where you are.

00:06:05.839 --> 00:06:07.910
It has nothing to do with the
size of the object.

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:11.130
And you become a black hole
when the size of the object is

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:13.389
smaller than the Schwarzschild
radius.

00:06:13.389 --> 00:06:16.312
Because under those
circumstances there's some

00:06:16.312 --> 00:06:20.509
position, or set of positions,
where you can be inside the

00:06:20.509 --> 00:06:24.591
Schwarzschild radius,
and therefore all of these very

00:06:24.591 --> 00:06:29.300
exotic effects start to happen.
Questions on this?

00:06:32.769 --> 00:06:35.680
Or have I just baffled you
further?

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:38.342
Well, we'll see.
Student: Is that the

00:06:38.342 --> 00:06:39.405
radius of the Sun?
Professor Charles

00:06:39.405 --> 00:06:40.154
Bailyn: Sorry.
Student: Is that the

00:06:40.154 --> 00:06:41.439
radius of the Sun?
Professor Charles

00:06:41.439 --> 00:06:43.695
Bailyn: Oh no,
this is the radius of the

00:06:43.695 --> 00:06:45.454
object.
Sun is--Sun has a dot in the

00:06:45.454 --> 00:06:47.790
middle--not that you could tell
with my handwriting.

00:06:57.509 --> 00:07:00.197
Okay, I don't know if--whether
that was helpful or not,

00:07:00.197 --> 00:07:02.850
but I felt the need to say it.
Yes, please.

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:04.275
Student: Could you
please explain the diagram that

00:07:04.275 --> 00:07:05.165
you [Inaudible]
Professor Charles

00:07:05.165 --> 00:07:07.999
Bailyn: This right here?
Yeah, so the situation is

00:07:07.999 --> 00:07:12.120
that--what is the relevant
M to put into this

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:13.832
equation?
This is true,

00:07:13.832 --> 00:07:16.060
by the way, in Newtonian
physics also.

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:21.331
If you're inside an object then
the mass outside of your

00:07:21.331 --> 00:07:25.644
position, this stuff,
doesn't count toward the

00:07:25.644 --> 00:07:30.290
M.
And you only want to count the

00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:34.503
mass inside of where you are.
Student: Okay,

00:07:34.503 --> 00:07:35.860
so that whole circle is an
object?

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:38.845
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Yeah,

00:07:38.845 --> 00:07:43.202
so this whole circle is an
object--object with mass and

00:07:43.202 --> 00:07:46.509
some--with some mass and some
radius.

00:07:46.509 --> 00:07:49.684
But now you're asking the
question, "What happens if

00:07:49.684 --> 00:07:52.050
you're somewhere inside this
thing?"

00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:54.356
Yes?
Student: Does that mean

00:07:54.356 --> 00:07:55.699
that the dotted line is
R_S?

00:07:55.699 --> 00:07:56.981
Professor Charles
Bailyn: No,

00:07:56.981 --> 00:07:58.373
the dot--well,
the dotted line could be

00:07:58.373 --> 00:08:01.636
anything.
You're at some position inside

00:08:01.636 --> 00:08:07.486
and this--the dotted line is the
radius at which your particular

00:08:07.486 --> 00:08:10.247
position is.
Student: [Inaudible]

00:08:10.247 --> 00:08:12.019
Professor Charles
Bailyn: No,

00:08:12.019 --> 00:08:14.399
it's just wherever you are
inside the thing.

00:08:14.399 --> 00:08:18.886
Less mass counts than you think
it's going to because it's only

00:08:18.886 --> 00:08:23.589
the stuff inside your own radius
that counts toward the metric,

00:08:23.589 --> 00:08:26.610
or toward the gravitational
force in the Newtonian thing.

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:29.975
You can be at--at whatever
point you choose to be inside

00:08:29.975 --> 00:08:32.240
here, you can draw this same
thing.

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:35.843
And the point of this is that
if you are now down in here,

00:08:35.843 --> 00:08:39.067
where you thought the
Schwarzschild radius was going

00:08:39.067 --> 00:08:41.449
to be,
for the whole of this mass--in

00:08:41.449 --> 00:08:45.064
fact, the Schwarzschild radius
is still going to be inside your

00:08:45.064 --> 00:08:48.330
position because much less mass
will count toward it.

00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:55.547
This isn't helping,
I can tell by the look on your

00:08:55.547 --> 00:08:57.040
face.
Okay, let me try again.

00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:58.100
Let me try again.

00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:06.297
Okay, here's an object.
And this object has a radius

00:09:06.297 --> 00:09:11.649
bigger than its Schwarzschild
radius, and it's got some mass.

00:09:11.649 --> 00:09:15.080
Okay, so, now I'm going to
draw, in dotted lines,

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:19.320
its Schwarzschild radius.
That's inside here, okay?

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:22.920
Now, supposing you're inside
this object.

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:28.020
Supposing you're living here.
Then, at that point,

00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:32.461
you--I draw this sort of
interior radius,

00:09:32.461 --> 00:09:36.477
here.
And if I'm at this point,

00:09:36.477 --> 00:09:43.107
then I ask, what is the
Schwarzschild radius that goes

00:09:43.107 --> 00:09:50.738
into the metric for something
that's sitting inside for person

00:09:50.738 --> 00:09:55.020
X, here.
And the answer to that is it's

00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:58.107
actually smaller than the
Schwarzschild radius of the

00:09:58.107 --> 00:10:00.659
entire object,
because less mass counts.

00:10:00.659 --> 00:10:04.820
Only this mass counts towards
the Schwarzschild radius.

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:08.554
So, there's some part of the
object whose mass no longer

00:10:08.554 --> 00:10:11.610
counts, because it's outside
your position.

00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:14.566
And so, as I move in here to
some interior point,

00:10:14.566 --> 00:10:18.077
the Schwarzschild radius that
is appropriate for me to use

00:10:18.077 --> 00:10:21.490
becomes smaller.
Does that make more sense?

00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:23.409
Student: Can you draw
that if it were a black hole?

00:10:23.409 --> 00:10:25.151
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Ah,

00:10:25.151 --> 00:10:27.690
so if I was black--if it was a
black hole, right.

00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:30.019
Okay, so now,
let's do the opposite case.

00:10:30.019 --> 00:10:34.610
Good question--is less than the
Schwarzschild radius.

00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:39.867
So, now here's my object,
and here's the Schwarzschild

00:10:39.867 --> 00:10:43.919
radius.
That's the difference, right?

00:10:43.919 --> 00:10:47.082
And therefore--and the
consequence of this,

00:10:47.082 --> 00:10:51.750
by the way, is that this whole
object sinks down to a point.

00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:54.409
Because, remember,
things inside the Schwarzschild

00:10:54.409 --> 00:10:56.690
radius have to contract down to
a point.

00:10:56.690 --> 00:10:59.580
So, I can't be part way through
it, no matter what I do.

00:11:10.549 --> 00:11:13.172
And, you know,
if I'm outside this tiny little

00:11:13.172 --> 00:11:15.969
thing, if I'm here,
I have the same Schwarzschild

00:11:15.969 --> 00:11:17.884
radius,
because all of the mass is

00:11:17.884 --> 00:11:19.110
interior to my position.

00:11:25.129 --> 00:11:29.065
So, the key thing is,
is the object smaller or bigger

00:11:29.065 --> 00:11:31.789
than its own Schwarzschild
radius?

00:11:31.789 --> 00:11:33.075
Student: So,
in that case,

00:11:33.075 --> 00:11:35.203
all the mass is going to be
closer than-- Professor

00:11:35.203 --> 00:11:36.730
Charles Bailyn: All
the--yeah,

00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:38.122
all--well, all the mass--
Student: [Inaudible]

00:11:38.122 --> 00:11:39.273
is going to [Inaudible]
Professor Charles

00:11:39.273 --> 00:11:40.827
Bailyn: If the radius of the
object is smaller than its

00:11:40.827 --> 00:11:43.398
Schwarzschild radius,
then all the mass is inside the

00:11:43.398 --> 00:11:46.951
Schwarzschild radius.
And any point in our Universe

00:11:46.951 --> 00:11:50.737
where, you know--and so,
all r greater than

00:11:50.737 --> 00:11:53.519
R_S is out
here,

00:11:53.519 --> 00:11:56.529
somewhere, and it doesn't
matter where you are.

00:11:56.529 --> 00:12:00.112
All that mass counts because
it's all inside the

00:12:00.112 --> 00:12:04.098
Schwarzschild radius anyway.
And then, when you get to this

00:12:04.098 --> 00:12:06.872
point, you have this magic
moment where r =

00:12:06.872 --> 00:12:09.590
R_S and
everything blows up.

00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:20.919
Right?
And that can't happen here.

00:12:20.919 --> 00:12:23.838
Because as you move in,
in the middle of the object,

00:12:23.838 --> 00:12:26.871
the Schwarzschild radius
shrinks down away from you as

00:12:26.871 --> 00:12:29.672
you get in,
because less and less mass

00:12:29.672 --> 00:12:33.110
counts towards it,
therefore it gets smaller.

00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:35.849
Yes?
Student: Would it be

00:12:35.849 --> 00:12:37.850
possible to have an object
[inaudible]

00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:40.985
density--like such that there
would be a point at which you

00:12:40.985 --> 00:12:42.986
would [inaudible]
Professor Charles

00:12:42.986 --> 00:12:44.500
Bailyn: Ah,
okay.

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:48.235
So, could you have some
incredible density gradient

00:12:48.235 --> 00:12:52.643
where you're actually gaining
more--you're actually catching

00:12:52.643 --> 00:12:56.230
up to the Schwarzschild radius
as you go in.

00:12:56.230 --> 00:13:00.375
In principle, yes.
But if you work out what that

00:13:00.375 --> 00:13:04.730
density gradient would have to
be, it would be incredibly

00:13:04.730 --> 00:13:07.276
steep.
Remember, there was a problem

00:13:07.276 --> 00:13:10.777
set at some point where we
discovered that the less mass

00:13:10.777 --> 00:13:13.988
there is in a black hole,
the denser it has to be in

00:13:13.988 --> 00:13:16.460
order to be inside its
Schwarzschild radius.

00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:20.747
So, as you're losing mass as
you get down in here,

00:13:20.747 --> 00:13:25.997
the amount by which it has to
be denser on the inside goes up

00:13:25.997 --> 00:13:29.960
really sharply.
But yes, such a thing can be.

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:33.695
Imagine, for example,
a black hole with an

00:13:33.695 --> 00:13:36.420
atmosphere.
Imagine there's some--or some,

00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:38.269
just, gas floating around out
here.

00:13:38.269 --> 00:13:41.373
If you think of that as one
object, then when you're outside

00:13:41.373 --> 00:13:44.320
the gas, if you think of the
outer edge of the gas as the

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:47.559
edge of the object,
then that's not a black hole.

00:13:47.559 --> 00:13:50.101
And if you come on--if you go
down--sink down into the

00:13:50.101 --> 00:13:52.019
atmosphere, eventually you'll
find it.

00:13:52.019 --> 00:13:55.524
So, that's an incredibly steep
density change because you've

00:13:55.524 --> 00:13:57.960
gone from an atmosphere to some
object.

00:13:57.960 --> 00:13:59.330
So, in principle,
that's possible.

00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:02.713
In any kind of real object
that's holding itself up,

00:14:02.713 --> 00:14:05.433
probably not,
because the density gradient

00:14:05.433 --> 00:14:09.250
would have to be so severe.
Yes?

00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:11.740
Student: How would this
work for non-spherical objects?

00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:13.169
Professor Charles
Bailyn: How does it work for

00:14:13.169 --> 00:14:14.550
non-spherical objects?
Excellent.

00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:21.490
Okay.
So, let's see.

00:14:21.490 --> 00:14:23.154
What happens is,
if you have a

00:14:23.154 --> 00:14:26.369
non-spherical--first of all,
the gravitational forces are

00:14:26.369 --> 00:14:29.928
sufficiently strong near a--if
you're anything close to a black

00:14:29.928 --> 00:14:31.967
hole,
that you're likely to end up

00:14:31.967 --> 00:14:34.604
spherical.
The only way you don't is if

00:14:34.604 --> 00:14:36.970
you're spinning.
Because then,

00:14:36.970 --> 00:14:40.270
you know, you bulge out at the
center.

00:14:40.270 --> 00:14:43.759
Spinning black holes exist.
They have a different metric.

00:14:43.759 --> 00:14:48.461
And the angular term becomes
important because you're

00:14:48.461 --> 00:14:52.620
spinning around and it's a
different metric.

00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:55.742
And the shape of the event
horizon where r is equal

00:14:55.742 --> 00:14:59.139
to R_S or the
equivalent in this other metric,

00:14:59.139 --> 00:15:01.557
is non-spherical.
And so, you can have

00:15:01.557 --> 00:15:04.914
non-spherical event horizons if
the thing is spinning,

00:15:04.914 --> 00:15:08.589
because that has the effect of
making the mass distribution

00:15:08.589 --> 00:15:11.912
different.
And this is called Kerr black

00:15:11.912 --> 00:15:14.940
hole, it has a Kerr metric,
K-E-R-R.

00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:18.710
And that's a different metric,
and it's got a whole other set

00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:22.230
of terms that have to do with
the rotation of the angular

00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:24.587
component.
But again, the same thing

00:15:24.587 --> 00:15:27.157
happens.
When you get to some place,

00:15:27.157 --> 00:15:31.608
all the terms blow up but it's
a non-spherical surface where

00:15:31.608 --> 00:15:33.788
that occurs.
And you have to do it in

00:15:33.788 --> 00:15:37.701
cylindrical coordinates.
It becomes a mess--not that it

00:15:37.701 --> 00:15:41.220
isn't a mess already.
Other questions?

00:15:44.429 --> 00:15:54.858
All right, let me go back to
the effects of general

00:15:54.858 --> 00:16:00.120
relativity.
We've already done one of these.

00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:08.792
So, what I'm going to talk
about is the post-Newtonian

00:16:08.792 --> 00:16:15.099
gravitational effects.
So, these are things where it

00:16:15.099 --> 00:16:19.940
just barely starts to deviate
away from what the predictions

00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:24.503
of Newton's laws would be.
So, just to go back,

00:16:24.503 --> 00:16:30.724
if you take that metric and you
kind of expand it in small

00:16:30.724 --> 00:16:36.509
quantities where the
Schwarzschild radius is much,

00:16:36.509 --> 00:16:38.779
much smaller than wherever you
are.

00:16:38.779 --> 00:16:41.879
And you take the first term of
the expansion.

00:16:41.879 --> 00:16:44.848
Mathematically,
it turns into the same things

00:16:44.848 --> 00:16:48.091
as Newton's laws.
And so, when you're out there

00:16:48.091 --> 00:16:51.610
in more or less flat space,
or close to flat space,

00:16:51.610 --> 00:16:55.763
then Newton's laws still apply,
because the expansion of the

00:16:55.763 --> 00:16:58.649
metric gives you the exact same
result.

00:16:58.649 --> 00:17:01.279
As the gravitational forces
become larger,

00:17:01.279 --> 00:17:05.256
you start to get post-Newtonian
terms, and things start to be a

00:17:05.256 --> 00:17:07.630
little bit different from
Newton.

00:17:07.630 --> 00:17:14.026
And we've already had one of
these--so, post-Newtonian effect

00:17:14.026 --> 00:17:19.250
number one is the precession of
the perihelion,

00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:24.187
where, unlike the prediction
for Newton, the orbit doesn't

00:17:24.187 --> 00:17:27.138
exactly repeat.
It sort of moves on a little

00:17:27.138 --> 00:17:30.087
bit each time.
And you get one of these nice,

00:17:30.087 --> 00:17:33.754
sort of, Spirograph patterns,
as an elliptical orbit

00:17:33.754 --> 00:17:37.350
gradually precesses,
or gradually moves around.

00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:42.059
So, that was the first one.
And that was the first one that

00:17:42.059 --> 00:17:44.101
was seen.
That was seen in Mercury,

00:17:44.101 --> 00:17:47.769
which is the planet you would
expect to see such a thing,

00:17:47.769 --> 00:17:50.820
because it's closest to the Sun
and therefore,

00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:54.616
R_S / r
is the largest number for

00:17:54.616 --> 00:17:57.870
Mercury--for any planet in the
Solar System.

00:17:57.870 --> 00:18:03.311
So, Mercury.
And, that actually turns out to

00:18:03.311 --> 00:18:07.454
have been known before Einstein
actually worked out the general

00:18:07.454 --> 00:18:12.176
relativity.
So, now, post-Newtonian effect

00:18:12.176 --> 00:18:17.100
number two is the deflection of
light.

00:18:22.339 --> 00:18:24.358
The whole idea,
remember, is that there's

00:18:24.358 --> 00:18:27.033
the--is that gravity works
because it curves space and

00:18:27.033 --> 00:18:30.011
objects moving along this curved
space appear to have curved

00:18:30.011 --> 00:18:32.940
trajectories.
That's true of light also.

00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:35.400
Light is also moving across
this curved space.

00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:39.964
So, there's a prediction in
general relativity that if you

00:18:39.964 --> 00:18:44.528
shine light near a massive
object, it's the path that that

00:18:44.528 --> 00:18:47.430
light will take.
It's curved.

00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:54.230
It's as if the light's being
gravitationally attracted by

00:18:54.230 --> 00:18:58.360
this object, So,
let's see here.

00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:00.831
Imagine the following situation.
Here are you,

00:19:00.831 --> 00:19:04.700
you're observing something.
Here's a star.

00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:08.193
And the path that light takes
to this star,

00:19:08.193 --> 00:19:13.099
from the star to your eye,
is some kind of straight line.

00:19:13.099 --> 00:19:15.359
And so, that's where you
perceive the star to be.

00:19:15.359 --> 00:19:23.195
Now, supposing that along--that
between you and this star,

00:19:23.195 --> 00:19:29.224
there's some object.
So, here's an object with mass

00:19:29.224 --> 00:19:35.071
M, some massive object.
Now, because the path is going

00:19:35.071 --> 00:19:40.098
to curve, the path that the
light takes from the star to

00:19:40.098 --> 00:19:45.400
your eye is going to now look
like something like this.

00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:47.869
And it's deflected by the
presence of the mass,

00:19:47.869 --> 00:19:49.910
which curves the space that
it's in.

00:19:49.910 --> 00:19:52.853
That means, you think,
because you're interpreting

00:19:52.853 --> 00:19:55.917
this as if the light is coming
straight towards you,

00:19:55.917 --> 00:20:01.180
you think the star is here.
Or it appears to be there.

00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:04.054
Because, you say,
all right, what is the angle at

00:20:04.054 --> 00:20:06.450
which the light is coming into
my eye?

00:20:06.450 --> 00:20:09.949
It's coming from there.
You don't realize that the star

00:20:09.949 --> 00:20:13.110
is actually over there and the
light has gone up toward the

00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:15.400
ceiling and bent back down to
your eye.

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:20.039
So, it's as if I'm looking up
there and seeing the exit sign.

00:20:20.039 --> 00:20:23.267
Because the light from the exit
sign has gone up to the ceiling,

00:20:23.267 --> 00:20:25.880
been bent around by some black
hole or something,

00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:29.300
up at the top of the classroom,
and come back down to my eye.

00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:31.837
Yeah?
Student: Well,

00:20:31.837 --> 00:20:33.512
I mean, wouldn't the light on
the other side of the planet

00:20:33.512 --> 00:20:34.805
showing the massive thing also
be [Inaudible]

00:20:34.805 --> 00:20:36.010
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Ah,

00:20:36.010 --> 00:20:39.680
it is possible, yes.
It is possible.

00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:41.658
In this particular case,
probably not,

00:20:41.658 --> 00:20:44.598
because there wouldn't be
enough bend in order to get it

00:20:44.598 --> 00:20:46.926
in here.
So, light going this way,

00:20:46.926 --> 00:20:50.568
for example--let me take
another color before this gets

00:20:50.568 --> 00:20:53.099
too complicated.
Light coming this way would

00:20:53.099 --> 00:20:55.089
bend like that and it would miss
your eye.

00:20:55.089 --> 00:20:58.538
However, there are situations
in which you see two images of

00:20:58.538 --> 00:21:00.759
the same object,
one from each side.

00:21:00.759 --> 00:21:02.599
These are called gravitational
lenses.

00:21:02.599 --> 00:21:04.640
Student: Can you see
many, many images?

00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:06.555
Professor Charles
Bailyn: In principle,

00:21:06.555 --> 00:21:10.682
if it's lined up exactly right.
Imagine that it's perfectly

00:21:10.682 --> 00:21:13.130
aligned.
Then you see this way,

00:21:13.130 --> 00:21:16.279
you see that way,
and you see out of the paper

00:21:16.279 --> 00:21:20.460
and you can see a whole ring.
This has actually been observed.

00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:23.258
Not the whole ring,
but large parts of the ring,

00:21:23.258 --> 00:21:25.580
because it's never perfectly
aligned.

00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:29.864
But you can see these things.
These are called Einstein's

00:21:29.864 --> 00:21:32.079
rings, and you can actually see
them.

00:21:32.079 --> 00:21:39.594
You can see these kinds of
multiple images in cases where

00:21:39.594 --> 00:21:45.230
this is a very distant galaxy or
quasar.

00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:51.118
Quasars are very bright,
very small, extragalactic

00:21:51.118 --> 00:21:55.194
objects.
And this is an intervening

00:21:55.194 --> 00:21:59.467
galaxy or galaxy cluster.
And you can see these multiple

00:21:59.467 --> 00:22:00.706
images.
I'll bring some pictures in

00:22:00.706 --> 00:22:01.965
next time.
They're very--they're

00:22:01.965 --> 00:22:05.196
amazing-looking things.
It's often true that you can

00:22:05.196 --> 00:22:08.317
see four images.
That comes about when the

00:22:08.317 --> 00:22:10.819
intervening mass is not
spherical.

00:22:10.819 --> 00:22:13.477
And so, you get weird
deflections and you--they're

00:22:13.477 --> 00:22:16.554
multiple directions.
You see the same object--a very

00:22:16.554 --> 00:22:19.441
spectacular thing.
These were discovered only

00:22:19.441 --> 00:22:23.571
recently but it turns out that
you can observe this effect even

00:22:23.571 --> 00:22:27.428
in our own Solar System.
Because what you can do--I'll

00:22:27.428 --> 00:22:30.692
bring in some pictures of
gravitational lenses,

00:22:30.692 --> 00:22:34.254
those are amazing things.
And what also happens is,

00:22:34.254 --> 00:22:37.341
if you're looking at something
big, like a galaxy,

00:22:37.341 --> 00:22:40.049
that has a shape,
it distorts the shape.

00:22:40.049 --> 00:22:43.294
It stretches the whole thing
out, and you get these amazing

00:22:43.294 --> 00:22:44.269
pictures.
All right.

00:22:44.269 --> 00:22:48.470
In any case,
in our own Solar System,

00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:52.670
you see this in the following
way.

00:22:52.670 --> 00:23:00.197
Here's the Sun,
and here's a star right behind

00:23:00.197 --> 00:23:03.660
the Sun.
And the light from the star

00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:06.579
comes like this,
and so you think the star is

00:23:06.579 --> 00:23:09.213
here.
So, if you look at a star when

00:23:09.213 --> 00:23:13.279
it's right next to the Sun,
right at the edge of the Sun,

00:23:13.279 --> 00:23:17.455
it seems to be in a different
position relative to stars

00:23:17.455 --> 00:23:20.720
further--relative to other stars
up here.

00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:24.758
Here's another star.
Then it would--if you looked at

00:23:24.758 --> 00:23:28.490
it at night when the Sun wasn't
in the way.

00:23:28.490 --> 00:23:30.375
Yes?
Student: Then how do you

00:23:30.375 --> 00:23:32.136
do astronomy during the daytime?
Professor Charles

00:23:32.136 --> 00:23:34.220
Bailyn: Excellent question,
I'm getting to that.

00:23:34.220 --> 00:23:37.321
Okay, so--but the principle
is--supposing the Sun were dark,

00:23:37.321 --> 00:23:40.968
okay.
Look at star behind the Sun,

00:23:40.968 --> 00:23:44.950
or right next to the Sun,
really.

00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:48.520
You can't see through the Sun.
I'm not that crazy.

00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:55.359
Star behind Sun.
And it appears to be in a

00:23:55.359 --> 00:24:03.819
different place,
position, than when observed at

00:24:03.819 --> 00:24:10.480
night, without the Sun in the
way.

00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:13.270
Okay, so how do you do
astronomy during the daytime?

00:24:13.270 --> 00:24:15.250
That's a good question.
Student: Eclipses.

00:24:15.250 --> 00:24:16.549
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Eclipses,

00:24:16.549 --> 00:24:19.185
yes.
You wait until there's a solar

00:24:19.185 --> 00:24:22.609
eclipse and then you do your
observation.

00:24:22.609 --> 00:24:33.349
Do this by observing during an
eclipse.

00:24:33.349 --> 00:24:35.774
And if you do this,
the position,

00:24:35.774 --> 00:24:40.319
the change in position of the
star, if it's right at the edge

00:24:40.319 --> 00:24:43.880
of the Sun--and you've now
blocked the Sun,

00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:46.834
because here's the Moon, right?
And the light from the Sun

00:24:46.834 --> 00:24:50.669
doesn't come through.
This change in position,

00:24:50.669 --> 00:24:55.349
that's an angle,
is around 1 arc second.

00:24:55.349 --> 00:24:58.210
And that's a positional change
you can observe.

00:24:58.210 --> 00:25:01.796
Remember the size of--the
apparent size of a star,

00:25:01.796 --> 00:25:05.089
when you look at it,
is about 1 arc second.

00:25:05.089 --> 00:25:09.789
So, it seems like it shifted a
significant amount.

00:25:09.789 --> 00:25:12.809
And so, you go,
you take a picture of the sky,

00:25:12.809 --> 00:25:16.633
of the stars behind the Sun,
during a total eclipse of the

00:25:16.633 --> 00:25:18.769
Sun.
Now, the problem with this is a

00:25:18.769 --> 00:25:21.758
practical problem.
Total eclipses of the Sun

00:25:21.758 --> 00:25:25.131
happen only for very short
amounts of time,

00:25:25.131 --> 00:25:29.372
and only occasionally,
and only in a small--over a

00:25:29.372 --> 00:25:33.009
small portion of the Earth at
any one time.

00:25:33.009 --> 00:25:34.950
How many people have seen an
eclipse of the Sun?

00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:39.148
Pretty spectacular thing, huh?
But, you know,

00:25:39.148 --> 00:25:41.550
you have to travel to get
there.

00:25:41.550 --> 00:25:44.690
It doesn't come to you.
So, here's what happened.

00:25:44.690 --> 00:25:53.539
In 1917, Einstein publishes his
theory of general relativity.

00:25:53.539 --> 00:25:58.125
And then, in 1919,
there's going to be an eclipse

00:25:58.125 --> 00:26:04.700
in Brazil, I think it was.
Eclipse in Brazil.

00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:07.813
And it seems like a good idea
that you should actually go and

00:26:07.813 --> 00:26:11.035
test this theory,
which has made a very specific

00:26:11.035 --> 00:26:15.579
prediction about what ought to
be going on with these stars.

00:26:15.579 --> 00:26:17.826
So Eddington,
we've heard of him before,

00:26:17.826 --> 00:26:21.283
he's the guy who trashed his
student Chandrasekhar some years

00:26:21.283 --> 00:26:24.014
later.
But at the time he was young,

00:26:24.014 --> 00:26:27.878
up-and-coming British
scientist, mounts an expedition

00:26:27.878 --> 00:26:30.330
to Brazil to test this theory.

00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:40.350
And it works.
Goes down there,

00:26:40.350 --> 00:26:43.440
he takes these pictures.
It does just what Einstein said.

00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:48.419
And this is the event that
makes Einstein into a great

00:26:48.419 --> 00:26:52.418
international figure.
This is front-page headlines

00:26:52.418 --> 00:26:55.164
around the world.
And part of the reason of why

00:26:55.164 --> 00:26:59.809
it was is, look at these dates.
Einstein is a German scientist.

00:26:59.809 --> 00:27:01.769
This is the middle of World War
I.

00:27:01.769 --> 00:27:04.716
And so, in the middle of World
War I a German scientist--he's

00:27:04.716 --> 00:27:06.730
later thought of as a Jewish
scientist,

00:27:06.730 --> 00:27:10.085
but at the time,
Hitler was not yet on the

00:27:10.085 --> 00:27:11.985
scene.
And so, Einstein was thought of

00:27:11.985 --> 00:27:14.558
as a German scientist.
So, this German scientist

00:27:14.558 --> 00:27:17.459
publishes a grand,
bizarre, new theory of the

00:27:17.459 --> 00:27:21.402
Universe right after the war.
The Brits mount an operation to

00:27:21.402 --> 00:27:24.949
go and check and see if this is
right, and it turns out to be

00:27:24.949 --> 00:27:27.035
correct.
So, this is now right after

00:27:27.035 --> 00:27:29.481
World War I, in the era when
everybody thought,

00:27:29.481 --> 00:27:31.980
well, we're never going to have
a war again.

00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:34.845
There's going to be peace and
justice and brotherhood

00:27:34.845 --> 00:27:37.269
throughout the world for the
rest of time.

00:27:37.269 --> 00:27:41.204
And as part of this,
the British mount an expedition

00:27:41.204 --> 00:27:44.289
to confirm a German theory of
science.

00:27:44.289 --> 00:27:47.692
And this is regarded as a huge
sign of the great new future

00:27:47.692 --> 00:27:50.859
that we're moving into of
international cooperation.

00:27:50.859 --> 00:27:55.268
And a consequence of this--this
is front-page news all over the

00:27:55.268 --> 00:27:57.970
world, and it makes Einstein
famous.

00:27:57.970 --> 00:27:59.880
This is what makes Einstein
famous.

00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:07.440
So, the fable,
here, is the 1919 eclipse

00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:13.420
expedition.
And the moral that was drawn at

00:28:13.420 --> 00:28:17.440
the time is, the great
international,

00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:23.245
is how science is this
wonderful international--maybe

00:28:23.245 --> 00:28:26.260
even universal--quest.

00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:33.053
And, in retrospect,
what it is, is,

00:28:33.053 --> 00:28:38.825
it's a great demonstration of,
you know, how science is

00:28:38.825 --> 00:28:42.740
supposed to work.
New theory makes a prediction.

00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:44.809
You go out and measure the
effect, and it works.

00:28:44.809 --> 00:28:50.680
So, this is,
science works as advertised.

00:28:55.660 --> 00:28:58.650
Except, you know,
maybe it doesn't.

00:28:58.650 --> 00:29:01.828
Because subsequently,
in subsequent years,

00:29:01.828 --> 00:29:06.246
people looked back at the
apparatus that Eddington and his

00:29:06.246 --> 00:29:10.960
team had put together and said,
you know, you can't actually

00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:14.460
make measurements that accurate
with this stuff.

00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:16.430
So, how were they able to make
this measurement?

00:29:16.430 --> 00:29:18.691
And, oddly enough,
for about fifty years,

00:29:18.691 --> 00:29:21.802
the photographic plates –
what they had done was taken

00:29:21.802 --> 00:29:24.460
photographs of the sky – had
disappeared.

00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:27.609
And so, nobody could go back
and check the original data.

00:29:27.609 --> 00:29:29.303
At some point,
subsequently,

00:29:29.303 --> 00:29:32.124
they kind of reappeared
inside--just recently,

00:29:32.124 --> 00:29:35.105
actually,
inside the personal effects of

00:29:35.105 --> 00:29:38.859
a British astronomer who had
gone to live in Chile.

00:29:38.859 --> 00:29:41.069
And nobody quite knows how he
got a hold of them.

00:29:41.069 --> 00:29:44.261
And, I actually have to say,
I'm not sure what the outcome

00:29:44.261 --> 00:29:47.732
of this is--whether people have
actually gone back and tried to

00:29:47.732 --> 00:29:50.698
measure this again.
So--and at the time,

00:29:50.698 --> 00:29:54.725
you know, Eddington,
who, in his subsequent life,

00:29:54.725 --> 00:30:00.180
demonstrated a real propensity
for believing his own theories,

00:30:00.180 --> 00:30:03.492
if you know what I mean--which
served him poorly when he was

00:30:03.492 --> 00:30:06.036
dealing with Chandrasekhar,
who was thinking of other

00:30:06.036 --> 00:30:08.112
things.
Eddington had said before he

00:30:08.112 --> 00:30:11.997
went on the expedition that he
was absolutely certain this was

00:30:11.997 --> 00:30:15.627
going to work because he had
studied Einstein's theory and

00:30:15.627 --> 00:30:18.673
had come to believe it,
because it was so beautiful and

00:30:18.673 --> 00:30:20.909
elegant.
And so, there's a famous story

00:30:20.909 --> 00:30:22.716
where somebody said,
well, Mr.

00:30:22.716 --> 00:30:26.454
Eddington what's--or said to
somebody else on the expedition,

00:30:26.454 --> 00:30:29.569
what will Eddington do if it
comes out wrong?

00:30:29.569 --> 00:30:32.427
And they said,
well, Eddington will just go

00:30:32.427 --> 00:30:35.719
insane.
And so, there's a little bit of

00:30:35.719 --> 00:30:40.039
suspicion attached to this
particular experiment.

00:30:40.039 --> 00:30:43.370
However, subsequent to that
this has been measured

00:30:43.370 --> 00:30:46.361
repeatedly, many times,
during many eclipses,

00:30:46.361 --> 00:30:49.079
and it's very clear that this
works.

00:30:49.079 --> 00:30:52.676
And as I said,
there's now evidence from other

00:30:52.676 --> 00:30:56.513
astronomical objects for the
deflection of light,

00:30:56.513 --> 00:31:00.030
all of which confirms
Einstein's theory.

00:31:00.030 --> 00:31:01.313
Yes?
Student: What does the

00:31:01.313 --> 00:31:02.054
second line say?
Professor Charles

00:31:02.054 --> 00:31:03.140
Bailyn: What does the second
line say?

00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:07.771
Let's see, eclipse expedition,
scientists and international,

00:31:07.771 --> 00:31:11.225
universal quest,
science works as advertised,

00:31:11.225 --> 00:31:15.644
maybe.
That's what I was trying to

00:31:15.644 --> 00:31:18.849
write down.
So, that's the second

00:31:18.849 --> 00:31:22.604
post-Newtonian test.
And the fact that it works in

00:31:22.604 --> 00:31:26.410
1919 is what makes people really
believe relativity,

00:31:26.410 --> 00:31:30.514
and what makes people think
that Einstein's this intense

00:31:30.514 --> 00:31:34.109
genius.
Okay, there are a couple of

00:31:34.109 --> 00:31:38.515
other post-Newtonian effects.
So here's, now,

00:31:38.515 --> 00:31:41.890
post-Newtonian effect number
three.

00:31:46.259 --> 00:31:49.540
And this is something called
the gravitational redshift.

00:31:54.330 --> 00:31:57.180
You've heard of a redshift.
Redshifts and blueshifts.

00:31:57.180 --> 00:31:59.210
They come about because of the
Doppler shift.

00:31:59.210 --> 00:32:01.525
Something moves towards you,
its light gets shifted to the

00:32:01.525 --> 00:32:03.314
blue.
Something moves away from you,

00:32:03.314 --> 00:32:05.069
its light gets shifted to the
red.

00:32:05.069 --> 00:32:11.934
Turns out, the wavelengths of
light also change due to

00:32:11.934 --> 00:32:14.912
gravity.
Or due to being emitted in a

00:32:14.912 --> 00:32:17.317
curved space-time,
if you want to use the

00:32:17.317 --> 00:32:20.730
relativistic formulation.
Basically, here's how it works.

00:32:20.730 --> 00:32:23.900
You have some object with
radius R,

00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:27.302
mass M,
and you have a light source on

00:32:27.302 --> 00:32:31.821
the surface of that object.
And you look at it from a

00:32:31.821 --> 00:32:33.986
distance.
You're out here at infinity

00:32:33.986 --> 00:32:36.551
watching this light.
And the light,

00:32:36.551 --> 00:32:42.716
if you emit green light here,
by the time it reaches you,

00:32:42.716 --> 00:32:46.570
it'll have shifted into the
red.

00:32:46.570 --> 00:32:51.160
And there's an equation.
Let me write down the equation.

00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:53.824
So, this is delta lambda
[Δλ]--oops,

00:32:53.824 --> 00:32:59.650
that one's not working anymore.
Δλ over λ_0.

00:32:59.650 --> 00:33:03.124
That's the shift in light.
And remember that the Doppler

00:33:03.124 --> 00:33:04.849
shift has some equation,
here.

00:33:04.849 --> 00:33:11.238
Well, here's the equation for
this shift, due to the

00:33:11.238 --> 00:33:18.021
gravitation of an object.
R_S /

00:33:18.021 --> 00:33:26.680
r, where this is the
distance to the given mass.

00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:30.242
Or if you're emitting light
from the surface of an object,

00:33:30.242 --> 00:33:33.992
the distance to the mass is the
distance to the center of the

00:33:33.992 --> 00:33:37.643
object.
So, in this particular case it

00:33:37.643 --> 00:33:41.990
would be the radius of the
object, minus 1.

00:33:41.990 --> 00:33:46.603
So, you can see that if there's
no mass, then the Schwarzschild

00:33:46.603 --> 00:33:49.059
radius is zero,
and this is 1 - 1,

00:33:49.059 --> 00:33:52.900
and there's no shift.
Okay, now why does this happen?

00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:57.292
This has to happen.
Imagine that you're standing on

00:33:57.292 --> 00:34:02.130
the surface of an object and you
throw an object up into the air.

00:34:02.130 --> 00:34:04.900
I have an object here.
I'm going to do this.

00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:07.941
What will happen?
As I throw it up into the air,

00:34:07.941 --> 00:34:10.796
it's going to slow down.
If I throw it faster than the

00:34:10.796 --> 00:34:13.469
escape velocity and I don't have
a ceiling and stuff,

00:34:13.469 --> 00:34:15.760
then it'll go--it'll keep going
away forever,

00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:17.061
but it will,
nevertheless,

00:34:17.061 --> 00:34:19.626
slow down.
If I throw it up slower than

00:34:19.626 --> 00:34:22.970
the escape velocity,
then it's going to rise to some

00:34:22.970 --> 00:34:25.790
height, stop,
turn around and fall back.

00:34:25.790 --> 00:34:29.257
Right?
So, that's what happens with an

00:34:29.257 --> 00:34:31.110
object.
Why is this happening?

00:34:31.110 --> 00:34:34.984
The reason it happens is
because as it moves--as it tries

00:34:34.984 --> 00:34:38.443
to move away from the Earth,
it has to lose energy,

00:34:38.443 --> 00:34:42.280
because it's pushing its way
out of the gravitational field.

00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:46.779
And so, it gradually slows
down, because its kinetic energy

00:34:46.779 --> 00:34:49.650
decreases, as it goes further
away,

00:34:49.650 --> 00:34:51.964
to balance the change in the
potential energy,

00:34:51.964 --> 00:34:54.639
for those of you who remember
high school physics.

00:34:54.639 --> 00:34:56.687
It balances the change in
potential energy,

00:34:56.687 --> 00:35:00.611
so the total energy is zero.
And so, the kinetic energy has

00:35:00.611 --> 00:35:03.631
to slow down.
And whether it slows down

00:35:03.631 --> 00:35:08.199
enough to stop it or not depends
on whether it's moving faster

00:35:08.199 --> 00:35:12.619
than its escape velocity or not.
Supposing I do this with a

00:35:12.619 --> 00:35:14.724
flashlight.
And instead of throwing a

00:35:14.724 --> 00:35:17.579
keychain up in the air,
I throw a photon up in the air.

00:35:17.579 --> 00:35:19.550
The photon starts out at the
speed of light.

00:35:19.550 --> 00:35:25.588
Now, that, too,
has to lose energy as it moves

00:35:25.588 --> 00:35:30.083
away from the Earth.
But light, as we know,

00:35:30.083 --> 00:35:32.750
always travels at the speed of
light.

00:35:32.750 --> 00:35:35.820
It doesn't slow down.
It can't slow down.

00:35:35.820 --> 00:35:38.912
So, what it has to do is,
it has to lose energy in some

00:35:38.912 --> 00:35:42.557
other way.
And the trick is that the

00:35:42.557 --> 00:35:48.710
energy of a photon is equal to a
couple of constants,

00:35:48.710 --> 00:35:54.389
h times c, over
the wavelength.

00:35:54.389 --> 00:36:00.439
So, as the energy gets less,
the wavelength gets longer--has

00:36:00.439 --> 00:36:04.028
to get bigger.
And so, what is happening here

00:36:04.028 --> 00:36:07.082
is, as you shine light off a
gravitating object,

00:36:07.082 --> 00:36:10.395
as it gets further and further
away from the object,

00:36:10.395 --> 00:36:13.405
it loses energy.
But it loses energy not by

00:36:13.405 --> 00:36:16.125
slowing down,
as an ordinary mass of objects

00:36:16.125 --> 00:36:18.720
would, but by changing its
wavelength.

00:36:21.820 --> 00:36:25.500
And now, go back and look at
this equation again.

00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:29.780
Supposing you're shining your
flashlight from the event

00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:34.537
horizon of a black hole--from
something where the distance to

00:36:34.537 --> 00:36:38.659
the object is equal to the
Schwarzschild radius.

00:36:38.659 --> 00:36:42.210
Then, you get Δλ equals
infinity.

00:36:42.210 --> 00:36:45.651
And you've redshifted your way
out to an infinitely large

00:36:45.651 --> 00:36:47.936
wavelength.
The consequence of that is that

00:36:47.936 --> 00:36:49.949
the energy of the light is equal
to zero.

00:36:49.949 --> 00:36:56.048
And so, this is how it happens
that light can't escape from a

00:36:56.048 --> 00:36:58.386
black hole.
Because, you know,

00:36:58.386 --> 00:37:01.605
if you have the Newtonian
vision of the escape velocity in

00:37:01.605 --> 00:37:04.653
mind--the thing goes up,
stops, turns around and comes

00:37:04.653 --> 00:37:07.961
back--and you imagine shining a
flashlight from inside the event

00:37:07.961 --> 00:37:11.062
horizon of a black hole,
you imagine that the light

00:37:11.062 --> 00:37:14.039
would go up, stop,
turn around and fall back.

00:37:14.039 --> 00:37:16.235
But light doesn't do that,
because light always goes at

00:37:16.235 --> 00:37:19.126
the speed of light.
So, what happens instead is,

00:37:19.126 --> 00:37:22.690
it redshifts itself out of
existence altogether.

00:37:22.690 --> 00:37:27.946
And so, that's the way light is
prevented from leaving a black

00:37:27.946 --> 00:37:30.458
hole.
Because if you shine from

00:37:30.458 --> 00:37:33.435
either inside,
or at, the event horizon,

00:37:33.435 --> 00:37:36.260
it'll redshift itself to
infinity.

00:37:36.260 --> 00:37:39.073
Yeah?
Student: Everything you

00:37:39.073 --> 00:37:42.177
just said still makes perfect
sense in the context of the

00:37:42.177 --> 00:37:44.783
Newtonian concept,
why do we need to [Inaudible]

00:37:44.783 --> 00:37:46.834
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Okay,

00:37:46.834 --> 00:37:49.440
so there is a Newtonian version
of this.

00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:52.289
You can imagine how you expand
this thing.

00:37:52.289 --> 00:37:57.860
But this particular equation is
relativistic.

00:37:57.860 --> 00:38:01.639
Oh, the other thing is that,
of course, in Newtonian

00:38:01.639 --> 00:38:05.789
physics, there's no reason for
light not to slow down.

00:38:05.789 --> 00:38:08.438
This business that light always
goes at the speed of light,

00:38:08.438 --> 00:38:10.949
regardless of the observer,
is a relativistic effect.

00:38:10.949 --> 00:38:12.908
So, you know,
if you take a photon and throw

00:38:12.908 --> 00:38:14.730
it in the air,
in a Newtonian concept,

00:38:14.730 --> 00:38:16.941
there's no reason it can't slow
down and turn around and come

00:38:16.941 --> 00:38:17.200
back.

00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:24.590
Yes?
Yeah?

00:38:24.590 --> 00:38:28.237
Student: [Inaudible]
Professor Charles

00:38:28.237 --> 00:38:31.420
Bailyn: Δλ over λ.
Δλ over λ.

00:38:31.420 --> 00:38:33.579
Student: Sorry,
next page.

00:38:33.579 --> 00:38:35.400
Professor Charles
Bailyn: This?

00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:37.425
Student: [Inaudible]
Professor Charles

00:38:37.425 --> 00:38:39.322
Bailyn: Okay,
so this is speed of light -

00:38:39.322 --> 00:38:41.157
Student: Yeah.
Professor Charles

00:38:41.157 --> 00:38:43.505
Bailyn: And this is another
famous constant called Planck's

00:38:43.505 --> 00:38:43.960
Constant.

00:38:47.449 --> 00:38:50.146
I don't think we're going to
use that equation for anything

00:38:50.146 --> 00:38:52.809
in particular.
But it's a couple of constants.

00:38:52.809 --> 00:38:55.795
So, basically,
the energy is proportional to 1

00:38:55.795 --> 00:38:57.059
/ λ.
Student: Okay.

00:38:57.059 --> 00:38:59.190
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Yeah.

00:38:59.190 --> 00:38:59.720
Other questions?

00:39:03.090 --> 00:39:04.600
Okay.

00:39:07.909 --> 00:39:10.599
If you turn it around--if you
sit on the surface of,

00:39:10.599 --> 00:39:12.920
I don't know,
a neutron star or something,

00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:16.833
and look at distant starlight,
that light will pick up energy

00:39:16.833 --> 00:39:20.326
as it comes towards you.
So, if you sit on a gravitating

00:39:20.326 --> 00:39:23.746
object and look at a distant
light, that light will actually

00:39:23.746 --> 00:39:26.300
be blueshifted,
because it will gain energy

00:39:26.300 --> 00:39:29.254
falling down toward you.
And so, while this is always

00:39:29.254 --> 00:39:32.695
referred to as the gravitational
redshift, because we're always

00:39:32.695 --> 00:39:35.859
imagining that we're some
distant observer in a flat space

00:39:35.859 --> 00:39:38.079
looking at some gravitating
object,

00:39:38.079 --> 00:39:41.083
in principle,
if you could live on a neutron

00:39:41.083 --> 00:39:45.413
star, all the stars would look
bluer than they do to us because

00:39:45.413 --> 00:39:50.500
of this effect.
So, it works both ways.

00:39:50.500 --> 00:39:56.358
This, by the way,
has now been tested in the

00:39:56.358 --> 00:39:59.750
laboratory.
Here's how you do it.

00:39:59.750 --> 00:40:05.113
You set up--you sit on top of a
ladder and you look at light

00:40:05.113 --> 00:40:09.750
coming from the surface and
coming up toward you.

00:40:09.750 --> 00:40:12.097
And then, you have
somebody--you have some

00:40:12.097 --> 00:40:14.730
confederate, or graduate
student, or something,

00:40:14.730 --> 00:40:18.280
who sits on the ground and
looks at light coming sideways.

00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:22.984
And you determine that the
wavelength detected here is

00:40:22.984 --> 00:40:27.599
slightly larger than the
wavelength detected here.

00:40:27.599 --> 00:40:30.246
That's a really small effect,
because the Earth's

00:40:30.246 --> 00:40:33.029
gravitational field--you know,
if you do this little

00:40:33.029 --> 00:40:35.843
calculation and you try and
figure out R_S

00:40:35.843 --> 00:40:37.929
/ r for the surface of
the Earth,

00:40:37.929 --> 00:40:41.849
it's a really,
really small difference from 1.

00:40:41.849 --> 00:40:43.448
Nevertheless,
because you're in the

00:40:43.448 --> 00:40:46.316
laboratory and we know how to
measure the wavelengths of light

00:40:46.316 --> 00:40:50.602
with incredible accuracy,
this effect can actually be

00:40:50.602 --> 00:40:54.390
measured in the lab,
and has been.

00:40:54.390 --> 00:40:56.615
Yes?
Student: So,

00:40:56.615 --> 00:41:00.199
if you're on a black hole or
whatever, shining a light upward

00:41:00.199 --> 00:41:03.246
and instead of doing the arc
thing just--see through

00:41:03.246 --> 00:41:06.949
the--stretches out and winks out
of existence at the top,

00:41:06.949 --> 00:41:08.739
then winks back into existence,
falls back?

00:41:08.739 --> 00:41:09.531
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Well,

00:41:09.531 --> 00:41:10.130
it can't fall back,
right.

00:41:10.130 --> 00:41:13.807
It can't fall back because it
can't stop, turn around and come

00:41:13.807 --> 00:41:15.022
back.
Student: So,

00:41:15.022 --> 00:41:16.690
it just winks out of existence
up here?

00:41:16.690 --> 00:41:19.185
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Well,

00:41:19.185 --> 00:41:23.601
notice what happens.
Supposing you go from the event

00:41:23.601 --> 00:41:28.329
horizon only to slightly above
the event horizon.

00:41:28.329 --> 00:41:32.179
The difference in the
wavelength you see is this

00:41:32.179 --> 00:41:36.275
quantity at the event horizon,
minus this quantity a little

00:41:36.275 --> 00:41:39.332
bit above the event horizon,
because it's still going to be

00:41:39.332 --> 00:41:41.690
redshifted.
But this is infinite at the

00:41:41.690 --> 00:41:44.347
event horizon.
So, by the time it moves even a

00:41:44.347 --> 00:41:47.240
tiny bit off the event horizon,
it's already gone.

00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:49.444
Student: Okay.
Professor Charles

00:41:49.444 --> 00:41:51.389
Bailyn: Yeah,
it's because this goes--this

00:41:51.389 --> 00:41:55.279
term becomes infinity large.
Oh, but I should say,

00:41:55.279 --> 00:42:01.875
this brings up a good point.
Supposing you're here and it's

00:42:01.875 --> 00:42:05.619
not a black hole.
So, it's not going to--it's not

00:42:05.619 --> 00:42:08.820
going to be disastrous.
But you're observing it,

00:42:08.820 --> 00:42:10.840
not at infinity,
but close.

00:42:10.840 --> 00:42:13.840
So here's--this is at some
R, and this is at

00:42:13.840 --> 00:42:16.780
R_1 a little
bit further away.

00:42:16.780 --> 00:42:25.436
So, what you would observe,
here, is Δλ / λ = Δλ at

00:42:25.436 --> 00:42:34.093
R_1 minus
Δ--let me write this so that

00:42:34.093 --> 00:42:42.371
there's some hope of reading it.
So, this gives you the Δλ you

00:42:42.371 --> 00:42:46.920
observe at R_1,
over λ_0,

00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:50.451
is equal to Δλ at
R_1,

00:42:50.451 --> 00:42:55.130
calculated by that formula,
minus Δλ at R.

00:42:59.519 --> 00:43:02.909
Because, it redshifts a little
bit from here to here.

00:43:02.909 --> 00:43:05.920
It would redshift more from
here out to infinity.

00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:09.889
And so, the way you calculate
that is you calculate redshift

00:43:09.889 --> 00:43:13.185
from here to infinity,
minus redshift from here to

00:43:13.185 --> 00:43:16.253
infinity.
And since--for something that

00:43:16.253 --> 00:43:20.034
is at the event horizon,
the redshift from there to

00:43:20.034 --> 00:43:23.687
infinity is infinite,
even if you're observing it

00:43:23.687 --> 00:43:26.750
just a little bit higher,
it's already gone.

00:43:26.750 --> 00:43:30.189
Student: Okay.
Professor Charles

00:43:30.189 --> 00:43:31.650
Bailyn: Does that make
sense?

00:43:31.650 --> 00:43:34.940
How are we doing?
Other questions?

00:43:34.940 --> 00:43:39.153
Yes?
Student: [Inaudible]

00:43:39.153 --> 00:43:43.267
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Oh,

00:43:43.267 --> 00:43:46.404
the photons,
remember--there's a

00:43:46.404 --> 00:43:50.815
relationship between the whole
way wave particle duality works

00:43:50.815 --> 00:43:53.251
for photons.
There's a relationship between

00:43:53.251 --> 00:43:55.280
the energy of the photon and the
wavelength.

00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:58.039
That was this E =
hc / λ thing.

00:43:58.039 --> 00:44:01.582
So, as the wavelength becomes
infinite, the energy in that

00:44:01.582 --> 00:44:05.210
photon goes to zero.
So, it's still a photon.

00:44:05.210 --> 00:44:07.813
But if you've got a photon with
zero energy, you're not going to

00:44:07.813 --> 00:44:08.310
notice it.

00:44:12.490 --> 00:44:14.903
Yes?
Student: Just as we,

00:44:14.903 --> 00:44:17.413
like, you know,
use the gravitational field of,

00:44:17.413 --> 00:44:19.869
like, Mercury,
Jupiter, or whatever to kind of

00:44:19.869 --> 00:44:22.379
slingshot probes into outer
space, could light,

00:44:22.379 --> 00:44:24.726
like, pick up the energy by,
like, you know,

00:44:24.726 --> 00:44:27.597
going around massive objects?
Professor Charles

00:44:27.597 --> 00:44:29.353
Bailyn: Well,
light picks up energy as it

00:44:29.353 --> 00:44:32.291
falls towards a massive object.
That's the inverse

00:44:32.291 --> 00:44:35.699
gravitational redshift.
You sit on the gravitating

00:44:35.699 --> 00:44:37.360
object.
You watch light coming at you

00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:39.260
from a distance.
So, it does that.

00:44:39.260 --> 00:44:42.615
That slingshot effect only
works if you add energy to the

00:44:42.615 --> 00:44:46.090
thing and kick yourself back out
of orbit at just the right

00:44:46.090 --> 00:44:48.753
moment.
You can't do that with light,

00:44:48.753 --> 00:44:52.344
because you can't give it
extra--you can't give it an

00:44:52.344 --> 00:44:54.693
extra velocity kick,
at any moment,

00:44:54.693 --> 00:44:57.834
to push it back out.
But it is true,

00:44:57.834 --> 00:45:02.831
that if you sit--you can do
this experiment backwards,

00:45:02.831 --> 00:45:05.513
right?
You have your light source up

00:45:05.513 --> 00:45:09.242
here, and you observe it from
down here, and then you'll see

00:45:09.242 --> 00:45:10.380
it blueshifted.

00:45:13.630 --> 00:45:15.190
Other questions?

00:45:18.580 --> 00:45:20.250
How are we doing?
Okay.

00:45:20.250 --> 00:45:26.980
Let me mention one last
post-Newtonian effect.

00:45:26.980 --> 00:45:32.880
This is post-Newtonian effect
number four.

00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:37.500
This is the existence of
gravitational waves.

00:45:41.230 --> 00:45:47.199
And the way this works is--let
me put these over here.

00:45:47.199 --> 00:45:50.762
Remember the bed sheet and the
basketball, over here,

00:45:50.762 --> 00:45:53.151
from a few days ago?
All right, now,

00:45:53.151 --> 00:45:56.562
imagine that that basketball,
which is some massive object,

00:45:56.562 --> 00:45:59.854
is moving back and forth on
the--it's orbiting some other

00:45:59.854 --> 00:46:02.639
thing on that bed sheet.
What will happen?

00:46:02.639 --> 00:46:07.078
Well, the bed sheet will ripple
in different ways as the thing

00:46:07.078 --> 00:46:09.658
moves around.
And this creates,

00:46:09.658 --> 00:46:12.810
essentially,
a wave of distortions of

00:46:12.810 --> 00:46:17.275
space-time that propagates
outward, as it turns out,

00:46:17.275 --> 00:46:22.885
at the speed of light.
So, the way this works is,

00:46:22.885 --> 00:46:29.626
as a mass moves back and
forth--perhaps because it's in

00:46:29.626 --> 00:46:35.835
orbit,
or for some other reason--it

00:46:35.835 --> 00:46:47.262
generates ripples in space-time.
These propagate outward at the

00:46:47.262 --> 00:46:51.302
speed of light.
And we'll talk later,

00:46:51.302 --> 00:46:54.240
maybe, about how one--what it
means to have a ripple in

00:46:54.240 --> 00:46:56.579
space-time, and how one might
detect it.

00:46:56.579 --> 00:47:04.158
But there's a more immediate
effect, which is that the energy

00:47:04.158 --> 00:47:11.863
in these so-called gravitational
waves--they carry energy with

00:47:11.863 --> 00:47:15.728
them.
And the energy comes from--is

00:47:15.728 --> 00:47:21.373
extracted from the orbit of the
object that's moving back and

00:47:21.373 --> 00:47:25.794
forth.
So, the orbit gradually loses

00:47:25.794 --> 00:47:30.936
energy.
And that means that the orbit

00:47:30.936 --> 00:47:34.519
gets smaller,
gradually.

00:47:34.519 --> 00:47:38.880
So, the orbit gets gradually
smaller.

00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:41.749
And so, in the Newtonian
approximation,

00:47:41.749 --> 00:47:45.978
things stay in orbit and
they're perfectly stable forever

00:47:45.978 --> 00:47:48.126
and ever,
and they just go orbiting

00:47:48.126 --> 00:47:49.619
around, and around,
and around.

00:47:49.619 --> 00:47:54.630
But, in general relativity,
there's a gradual,

00:47:54.630 --> 00:47:59.751
slow loss of energy,
and objects will gradually

00:47:59.751 --> 00:48:03.659
spiral in.
Now, this happens really slowly.

00:48:03.659 --> 00:48:07.159
It has not been detected in the
Solar System.

00:48:07.159 --> 00:48:09.406
That is to say,
even the orbit of Mercury,

00:48:09.406 --> 00:48:12.638
we can't measure its orbital
period accurately enough to see

00:48:12.638 --> 00:48:15.579
this slow down.
Certainly all the planets in

00:48:15.579 --> 00:48:19.310
the Solar System have been
happily going in their orbits

00:48:19.310 --> 00:48:22.905
for four-and-a-half billion
years with no sign of this

00:48:22.905 --> 00:48:27.893
effect.
But you can see this in certain

00:48:27.893 --> 00:48:33.780
kinds of binary stars.
Stars which happen to have very

00:48:33.780 --> 00:48:35.040
short orbits.

00:48:38.230 --> 00:48:43.475
And in particular,
there's something called the

00:48:43.475 --> 00:48:47.419
binary pulsar.
Pulsar is a kind of neutron

00:48:47.419 --> 00:48:50.384
star.
And these gravitational wave

00:48:50.384 --> 00:48:55.996
effects, the gradual decrease in
the orbit, has been observed in

00:48:55.996 --> 00:48:59.521
binary pulsars.
And we'll talk about that,

00:48:59.521 --> 00:49:00.854
I guess, next time.

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:05.293
Professor Robert Shiller:
I want to talk today about

00:00:05.293 --> 00:00:06.280
the efficient markets
hypothesis.

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.142
Let me just first say,
last lecture was about

00:00:14.142 --> 00:00:18.672
insurance and I was telling you
about the theory of insurance

00:00:18.672 --> 00:00:23.202
and how it has evolved over the
years and how it has produced

00:00:23.202 --> 00:00:25.090
some real benefits.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.600
Is that better?
It says, "Mike volume."

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.625
I wanted to just tie this
in--the advantages of insurance

00:00:47.625 --> 00:00:52.670
that we have to some big events
that occurred and that will,

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.104
I think, point out the
strengths and weaknesses of our

00:00:57.104 --> 00:01:00.782
institutions.
We had a terrible hurricane a

00:01:00.782 --> 00:01:03.789
couple of years ago in Los
Angeles;

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:11.204
Hurricane Katrina damaged the
city of--I'm sorry did I say Los

00:01:11.204 --> 00:01:14.948
Angeles?
You have to stop me when I say

00:01:14.948 --> 00:01:19.760
things that are obviously wrong.
My mind lapses sometimes--New

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:24.099
Orleans--and Los Angeles doesn't
have to worry about hurricanes

00:01:24.099 --> 00:01:27.040
as far as I know,
unless there's some major

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.035
change.
In New Orleans there was a

00:01:30.035 --> 00:01:33.823
Hurricane Katrina;
it broke the levies that were

00:01:33.823 --> 00:01:38.250
surrounding the city and caused
the flooding of the city.

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:44.569
What saved the people of the
city, mostly?

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:49.425
I would say it was actually the
insurance institutions because

00:01:49.425 --> 00:01:54.519
the city was heavily damaged but
homes were generally insured.

00:01:54.519 --> 00:01:58.950
There were some conflicts when
this huge disaster came.

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.908
Some people had wind insurance
and some people had flood

00:02:03.908 --> 00:02:08.505
insurance and it became
difficult whether this was a

00:02:08.505 --> 00:02:13.197
wind or a flood problem,
because the wind caused the

00:02:13.197 --> 00:02:15.110
flood.
So, if you had only wind

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.334
insurance are you covered?
There was a lot bickering and

00:02:18.334 --> 00:02:21.449
arguments afterwards but I think
it worked out well.

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:26.409
There were surveys of customer
satisfaction after the event and

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:30.169
I think, generally,
people were happy with their

00:02:30.169 --> 00:02:34.242
insurance companies.
Of course, there were some that

00:02:34.242 --> 00:02:38.410
were not, who may have found out
that they weren't covered;

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.949
but on the whole,
the experience worked well.

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:47.869
The other thing I want to say
about the last lecture is that

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:53.214
as financial progress moves on,
the distinction between

00:02:53.214 --> 00:02:57.190
insurance and other forms of
risk management may get blurred.

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.436
One very interesting thing
that's been happening is that we

00:03:01.436 --> 00:03:05.829
are starting to see development
of another institution called

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:09.606
the catastrophe bond,
which is another way that

00:03:09.606 --> 00:03:14.045
people have for protecting
themselves against catastrophes

00:03:14.045 --> 00:03:18.595
and it's not insurance.
A catastrophe bond is a bond

00:03:18.595 --> 00:03:23.196
that the issuer doesn't have to
pay off if there's a

00:03:23.196 --> 00:03:27.085
catastrophe.
You could have hurricanes--the

00:03:27.085 --> 00:03:32.072
City of New Orleans could raise
money with catastrophe bonds

00:03:32.072 --> 00:03:36.974
that they have to pay back if
there's no hurricane but they

00:03:36.974 --> 00:03:41.370
don't have to pay back if there
is a hurricane.

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.968
Or it could be some mixture:
they'd pay back part of it if

00:03:44.968 --> 00:03:48.069
there is a hurricane.
That's like insurance, isn't it?

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:51.607
But it doesn't operate through
an insurance company,

00:03:51.607 --> 00:03:54.520
it operates through a
securities market.

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:58.490
A good example of that is a
couple of years ago the

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:02.619
Government of Mexico issued
catastrophe bonds against

00:04:02.619 --> 00:04:05.989
earthquakes.
Mexico City was hit by a

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:11.587
terrible earthquake about twenty
years ago and it's vulnerable to

00:04:11.587 --> 00:04:15.677
being hit again.
So, what does Mexico do about

00:04:15.677 --> 00:04:18.153
this?
Mexico could wait until there

00:04:18.153 --> 00:04:22.236
is a hurricane (sic) and hope
that there's some international

00:04:22.236 --> 00:04:25.231
relief effort,
but that's not a very good way

00:04:25.231 --> 00:04:27.774
to proceed.
We want to arrange it in

00:04:27.774 --> 00:04:30.558
advance.
What Mexico did was issue cat

00:04:30.558 --> 00:04:35.267
bonds that have to be repaid in
the absence of a hurricane and

00:04:35.267 --> 00:04:39.050
have a lower repayment if there
is--I'm sorry,

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.949
I'm not on my best form
today--earthquake.

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:46.639
Mexico City does not have to
worry about hurricanes either.

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:52.780
Every area is different and
they have their own individual

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:56.824
characteristics.
Right now, the insurance

00:04:56.824 --> 00:05:01.471
industry is a bit challenged
because--in terms of some

00:05:01.471 --> 00:05:07.170
risks--because the risks seem to
be changing through time and,

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:10.569
notably, it looks like
hurricane risk is increasing.

00:05:10.569 --> 00:05:14.334
So people who are insured
in--it seems to be increasing

00:05:14.334 --> 00:05:18.099
because of global warming,
although I don't know if all

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:22.369
scientists are agreed on that.
If you live in a coastal area

00:05:22.369 --> 00:05:26.365
of Florida it does appear that
your risk is increasing through

00:05:26.365 --> 00:05:29.300
time.
So insurance companies want to

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:34.040
raise your rates and this is a
huge issue down in Florida.

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:38.866
Well, the government has kind
of taken over for the time

00:05:38.866 --> 00:05:42.639
being--insurance in
Florida--because we have

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:45.379
problems.
People are having problems

00:05:45.379 --> 00:05:47.839
paying the increased insurance
premium.

00:05:47.839 --> 00:05:53.872
I don't think we've figured out
finally how insurance will

00:05:53.872 --> 00:05:58.000
ultimately look in a matter of
years.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.925
But, I think that the important
thing is that it's protecting

00:06:01.925 --> 00:06:04.320
against us already,
maybe imperfectly,

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:07.950
but it's already protecting us
against some of our worst fears,

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:12.642
like hurricanes and earthquakes.
I think the system is evolving

00:06:12.642 --> 00:06:16.163
and we're getting new
developments like cat bonds that

00:06:16.163 --> 00:06:19.019
are changing the way we're doing
things.

00:06:19.019 --> 00:06:23.039
In the future,
I think these will develop more

00:06:23.039 --> 00:06:28.310
and make us even better able to
handle catastrophe risks.

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:32.089
Anyway, that's the last lecture.
Today I wanted to talk

00:06:32.089 --> 00:06:35.915
about--back to securities
markets or actually,

00:06:35.915 --> 00:06:38.550
more general,
asset markets.

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:45.498
I want to talk today about the
efficient markets hypothesis,

00:06:45.498 --> 00:06:52.094
which is a very important
intellectual construct that has

00:06:52.094 --> 00:06:56.569
guided a lot of theory in
finance.

00:06:56.569 --> 00:07:00.348
I want to talk first about the
history of the hypothesis--I

00:07:00.348 --> 00:07:04.388
haven't defined it yet for you
but maybe you already have heard

00:07:04.388 --> 00:07:07.189
of this--but history of the
hypothesis,

00:07:07.189 --> 00:07:10.222
the arguments for it,
and then the arguments against

00:07:10.222 --> 00:07:13.449
it.
I want to talk about technical

00:07:13.449 --> 00:07:18.819
analysis and empirical evidence
in the literature--about

00:07:18.819 --> 00:07:24.483
technical analysis--and other
schools of thought that doubt

00:07:24.483 --> 00:07:28.985
the market efficiency,
talk somewhat about behavioral

00:07:28.985 --> 00:07:30.730
economics.
Then, finally,

00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:34.220
we have a homework assignment;
actually, it's coming up.

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:38.718
I'll start talking about it now
so you--it will be an assignment

00:07:38.718 --> 00:07:43.003
for you to try to forecast the
stock market using statistical

00:07:43.003 --> 00:07:46.851
methods.
You don't have to look at the

00:07:46.851 --> 00:07:49.819
screen yet;
I'll come back to that.

00:07:49.819 --> 00:07:57.110
What is the efficient markets
hypothesis?

00:07:57.110 --> 00:08:03.106
The term actually is a fairly
recent origin--that is,

00:08:03.106 --> 00:08:09.680
a few decades ago--but the idea
goes back much further.

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:17.429
The idea is that in asset
markets that have good

00:08:17.429 --> 00:08:27.321
regulations and market makers
and developed markets that have

00:08:27.321 --> 00:08:35.730
a lot of depth and liquidity--in
these markets,

00:08:35.730 --> 00:08:42.402
the prices that you see are
perfect indicators of true

00:08:42.402 --> 00:08:44.937
value.
In other words,

00:08:44.937 --> 00:08:51.149
efficient market says that the
market efficiently incorporates

00:08:51.149 --> 00:08:57.157
all information and the prices
are like the best information

00:08:57.157 --> 00:09:01.728
about the value of something.
In other words,

00:09:01.728 --> 00:09:05.645
efficient markets hypothesis
tells you: trust markets,

00:09:05.645 --> 00:09:08.379
don't trust people,
trust markets.

00:09:08.379 --> 00:09:14.980
I've been trying to find out
who said that first.

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:20.149
The earliest statement of the
efficient markets hypothesis,

00:09:20.149 --> 00:09:24.427
although it doesn't call it the
efficient markets

00:09:24.427 --> 00:09:28.972
hypothesis--the earliest
statement that I could find

00:09:28.972 --> 00:09:34.141
comes from a book written in
1889 by George Gibson and it's

00:09:34.141 --> 00:09:38.420
called The Stock Exchanges of
London,

00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:42.809
Paris, and New York.
 I'll quote him,

00:09:42.809 --> 00:09:48.639
he said, "When shares become
publicly-known in an open

00:09:48.639 --> 00:09:51.649
market,
the value, which they acquire

00:09:51.649 --> 00:09:54.876
there, may be regarded as the
judgment of the best

00:09:54.876 --> 00:09:59.279
intelligence concerning them."
I was kind of interested to see

00:09:59.279 --> 00:10:02.273
this book.
I found it in the Mudd Library,

00:10:02.273 --> 00:10:05.542
actually by accident,
looking through old stock

00:10:05.542 --> 00:10:11.387
market books.
The book had some interesting

00:10:11.387 --> 00:10:15.011
observations.
One observation,

00:10:15.011 --> 00:10:19.487
which took my interest,
was that he points out that in

00:10:19.487 --> 00:10:24.133
this modern electronic age
information speeds around the

00:10:24.133 --> 00:10:28.271
globe at the speed of
electricity--or the speed of

00:10:28.271 --> 00:10:30.910
light.
When I first read that I

00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:33.156
thought for a minute,
wait a minute,

00:10:33.156 --> 00:10:35.274
1889?
That sounds like 1989 or

00:10:35.274 --> 00:10:36.010
something.

00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:42.650
Just a moment.

00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:49.170
We found the microphone.
Oh, it was right there?

00:10:57.540 --> 00:10:59.880
Now I am free from my tether.

00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:09.950
In 1889, they had already
invented the telegraph.

00:11:09.950 --> 00:11:12.059
In fact, that goes back decades
earlier.

00:11:12.059 --> 00:11:16.825
The telephone was starting to
appear, so it really was true

00:11:16.825 --> 00:11:20.769
that information would speed
around the globe.

00:11:20.769 --> 00:11:25.659
Information that became
publicly-known would be entered

00:11:25.659 --> 00:11:29.190
into market price almost
immediately.

00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:34.685
The conclusion that Gibson had
was that there's no hope in

00:11:34.685 --> 00:11:40.471
trying to beat the price or beat
the market because the price

00:11:40.471 --> 00:11:44.809
already has all of the
information in it.

00:11:44.809 --> 00:11:47.870
Let me elaborate on that theme
a little bit.

00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:52.273
Actually, it goes back before
telegraph, there was a famous

00:11:52.273 --> 00:11:55.537
story of Mr.
Reuters, who had an information

00:11:55.537 --> 00:11:59.029
service before the telegraph was
invented.

00:11:59.029 --> 00:12:04.101
He wanted to help his clients
get the information first so

00:12:04.101 --> 00:12:09.439
that they could trade on it and
he had the idea of using what

00:12:09.439 --> 00:12:13.604
you call carrier pigeons.
What you do is you get these

00:12:13.604 --> 00:12:16.830
birds and you raise them--you
know what I'm talking about,

00:12:16.830 --> 00:12:18.698
right?
You raise them in one place and

00:12:18.698 --> 00:12:20.669
then they're going to want to go
back there.

00:12:20.669 --> 00:12:23.573
Then you take them away in a
cage to another city and when

00:12:23.573 --> 00:12:26.375
you need to get a message
across, you tie the message to

00:12:26.375 --> 00:12:28.259
the pigeon's foot and release
it.

00:12:28.259 --> 00:12:32.684
Then it will fly back and it
will beat any other method of

00:12:32.684 --> 00:12:35.515
message transmission.
Incidentally,

00:12:35.515 --> 00:12:40.500
Reuter's information service is
still in business today and now

00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:44.440
they use computers the way
everyone else does,

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:47.919
but the whole principle
precedes the invention of

00:12:47.919 --> 00:12:50.709
computers.
The idea is that the only way

00:12:50.709 --> 00:12:54.746
you can beat the market is to
get information that nobody else

00:12:54.746 --> 00:12:57.461
has.
The way it works today is that

00:12:57.461 --> 00:13:01.965
the--we can't actually improve
on the speed from 1889 because

00:13:01.965 --> 00:13:06.018
they were already going at
virtually the speed of light

00:13:06.018 --> 00:13:10.414
with their information;
but, we can improve on our

00:13:10.414 --> 00:13:13.744
access to it.
Now, many people have beepers

00:13:13.744 --> 00:13:18.150
or something like this in their
pocket that wakes up and tells

00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:21.973
them when news is announced.
What happens where there's news

00:13:21.973 --> 00:13:24.874
about a stock?
Let's say it's a drug company

00:13:24.874 --> 00:13:29.290
that just makes an announcement
that it has a new drug--let's

00:13:29.290 --> 00:13:33.853
say good news--or it has gotten
FDA approval to market some new

00:13:33.853 --> 00:13:36.757
drug.
Well, it would put that out

00:13:36.757 --> 00:13:41.815
over the network of information
and some people would have their

00:13:41.815 --> 00:13:45.830
things beep on them and alert
them immediately.

00:13:45.830 --> 00:13:49.659
There are analysts who try to
keep up with news about stocks.

00:13:49.659 --> 00:13:54.632
So, these analysts then would
jump to action when they hear

00:13:54.632 --> 00:13:58.527
news like that.
That's because they know that

00:13:58.527 --> 00:14:03.235
markets move really fast to
important new information and

00:14:03.235 --> 00:14:07.566
they've got to be there first.
What happens when the drug

00:14:07.566 --> 00:14:11.159
company announces that they have
some news--important news?

00:14:11.159 --> 00:14:14.013
Well, the guys who are with
their beepers immediately spring

00:14:14.013 --> 00:14:16.480
to action and try to figure out
what the news is.

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:19.861
Within seconds they're trading
because you know you've got to

00:14:19.861 --> 00:14:23.086
be there first;
otherwise, you can't benefit

00:14:23.086 --> 00:14:25.210
from the news.
What happens?

00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:27.314
They say they've
announced--they've got approval

00:14:27.314 --> 00:14:30.134
for this new drug.
Then maybe do a quick call to

00:14:30.134 --> 00:14:33.917
their drug company expert and
say, quick how much should I

00:14:33.917 --> 00:14:36.440
change the valuation of this
stock?

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:39.864
The guy will give a quick
guess--this is now twenty

00:14:39.864 --> 00:14:42.535
seconds after the
announcement--and then

00:14:42.535 --> 00:14:46.370
immediately you place a big
trade for a million shares or

00:14:46.370 --> 00:14:49.868
plus or minus.
Then the guy calls back thirty

00:14:49.868 --> 00:14:53.629
seconds later and says,
"Oh no, I wasn't exactly right

00:14:53.629 --> 00:14:56.362
on that.
I've had thirty more seconds to

00:14:56.362 --> 00:14:59.259
think about this,
so let me change it again."

00:14:59.259 --> 00:15:02.517
Over the next few minutes,
the price--a lot of people are

00:15:02.517 --> 00:15:05.950
trading like that so the price
is jumping around rapidly.

00:15:05.950 --> 00:15:08.965
Then, after maybe five minutes,
these people have had time to

00:15:08.965 --> 00:15:12.181
assimilate it and think about it
and check their thinking and the

00:15:12.181 --> 00:15:15.908
price starts to settle down.
Maybe I'm exaggerating how fast

00:15:15.908 --> 00:15:19.257
it settles down.
Maybe an hour later you have a

00:15:19.257 --> 00:15:23.267
committee meeting and the
experts are arguing about what

00:15:23.267 --> 00:15:27.860
this really means and trying to
assimilate other information and

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:31.332
coordinate with it;
but, after two hours it started

00:15:31.332 --> 00:15:33.657
to really settle down.
Suppose you then,

00:15:33.657 --> 00:15:36.060
the next day,
read in The Wall Street

00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:38.710
Journal about this new
announcement.

00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:42.085
Do you think you have any
chance of beating the market by

00:15:42.085 --> 00:15:45.140
trading on it?
I mean, you're like twenty-four

00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:48.309
hours late, but I hear people
tell me--I hear,

00:15:48.309 --> 00:15:50.919
"I read in Business Week
that there was a new

00:15:50.919 --> 00:15:53.120
announcement,
so I'm thinking of buying."

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:55.860
I say, "Well,
Business Week--that

00:15:55.860 --> 00:15:58.529
information is probably a week
old."

00:15:58.529 --> 00:16:02.274
Even other people will talk
about trading on information

00:16:02.274 --> 00:16:05.541
that's years old,
so you kind of think that maybe

00:16:05.541 --> 00:16:08.435
these people are naïve.
First of all,

00:16:08.435 --> 00:16:11.519
you're not a drug company
expert or whatever it is that's

00:16:11.519 --> 00:16:14.166
needed.
Secondly, you don't know the

00:16:14.166 --> 00:16:18.061
math--you don't know how to
calculate present values,

00:16:18.061 --> 00:16:22.870
probably.
Thirdly, you're a month late.

00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:27.521
You get the impression that a
lot of people shouldn't be

00:16:27.521 --> 00:16:31.294
trying to beat the market.
You might say,

00:16:31.294 --> 00:16:36.813
to a first approximation,
the market has it all right so

00:16:36.813 --> 00:16:40.844
don't even try.
The efficient markets

00:16:40.844 --> 00:16:47.095
hypothesis is a hypothesis that
one should respect financial

00:16:47.095 --> 00:16:54.600
markets very much.
Your textbook by Fabozzi, et al.

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:58.111
mentions--I looked it up in the
index to see what they say about

00:16:58.111 --> 00:17:01.549
efficient markets hypothesis.
They define it.

00:17:01.549 --> 00:17:05.867
I'm quoting the textbook
Fabozzi, "Publicly-available,

00:17:05.867 --> 00:17:10.592
relevant information about the
issuers will lead to correct

00:17:10.592 --> 00:17:13.607
pricing of freely-traded
securities in

00:17:13.607 --> 00:17:18.484
properly-functioning markets."
That's their definition of the

00:17:18.484 --> 00:17:23.119
efficient markets hypothesis.
They didn't say it was right;

00:17:23.119 --> 00:17:25.550
they just said that's the
hypothesis.

00:17:25.550 --> 00:17:30.461
What Fabozzi, et al.
said is that the hypothesis has

00:17:30.461 --> 00:17:35.015
informed a lot of regulation.
The Securities and Exchange

00:17:35.015 --> 00:17:38.914
Commission and other agencies
that regulate financial markets

00:17:38.914 --> 00:17:42.880
have shown some faith in the
efficient markets hypothesis.

00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:47.014
Therefore, they feel that
their--maybe their primary

00:17:47.014 --> 00:17:52.122
mission is to regulate the flow
of information to make sure that

00:17:52.122 --> 00:17:56.662
it's an even playing field so
that everyone has access to

00:17:56.662 --> 00:18:00.240
information at the same time.
For example,

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:03.820
the Securities and Exchange
Commission requires that when a

00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:06.968
corporation publishes
information that's relevant to

00:18:06.968 --> 00:18:10.906
the value of their stock,
they have to put it out to

00:18:10.906 --> 00:18:15.480
everyone at once or there's
rules about what that means.

00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:18.688
Typically, they'll have a
webcast or something like that

00:18:18.688 --> 00:18:21.897
and it's announced in advance,
so everyone who is really

00:18:21.897 --> 00:18:25.725
interested can listen in.
I don't find a whole lot of

00:18:25.725 --> 00:18:30.075
enthusiasm in the Fabozzi book
for the efficient markets

00:18:30.075 --> 00:18:34.980
hypothesis and maybe that's
because it's not exactly right,

00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:37.300
which is my view.
It's a half truth;

00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:40.468
I'll come back to that.
I want to quote another

00:18:40.468 --> 00:18:42.841
best-selling textbook,
not your own,

00:18:42.841 --> 00:18:46.557
but there's another textbook,
Brealey and Myers,

00:18:46.557 --> 00:18:50.170
which is a textbook of
corporate finance.

00:18:50.170 --> 00:18:53.909
They are much more enthusiastic
about efficient markets

00:18:53.909 --> 00:18:56.731
hypothesis.
At the end of their textbook,

00:18:56.731 --> 00:19:00.640
they have a concluding chapter
and the concluding chapter is

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:04.682
built around what they call the
"seven most important ideas in

00:19:04.682 --> 00:19:07.494
finance."
One of those seven ideas to

00:19:07.494 --> 00:19:10.991
them is efficient markets.
They don't call it a

00:19:10.991 --> 00:19:15.503
hypothesis, they just say
"efficient markets," which they

00:19:15.503 --> 00:19:19.289
define as the theory that--I'm
quoting them,

00:19:19.289 --> 00:19:22.624
"Security prices accurately
reflect available information

00:19:22.624 --> 00:19:25.660
and respond rapidly to new
information as soon as it

00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:28.345
becomes available."
Then they have a little

00:19:28.345 --> 00:19:31.090
qualifier--I think this is
interesting--they say,

00:19:31.090 --> 00:19:33.950
"Don't misunderstand the
efficient market idea,

00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:36.990
it doesn't say that there are
no taxes or costs.

00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:40.392
It doesn't say that there
aren't some clever people and

00:19:40.392 --> 00:19:43.142
some stupid ones.
It merely implies that

00:19:43.142 --> 00:19:46.390
competition in capital markets
is very tough.

00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:50.942
There are no money machines and
security prices reflect the true

00:19:50.942 --> 00:19:56.244
underlying value of assets."
That's a pretty enthusiastic

00:19:56.244 --> 00:20:00.049
endorsement of efficient
markets.

00:20:00.049 --> 00:20:03.019
I said I have some doubts about
it.

00:20:03.019 --> 00:20:08.505
I guess I don't--I guess what I
don't like is their concluding

00:20:08.505 --> 00:20:13.361
statement, "Security prices
reflect the true underlying

00:20:13.361 --> 00:20:17.119
value of assets."
I don't think that's really

00:20:17.119 --> 00:20:20.513
true but I guess I agree,
it's tough to make money

00:20:20.513 --> 00:20:23.630
reliably and quickly in
financial markets.

00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:26.388
So, if that's what efficient
markets means,

00:20:26.388 --> 00:20:27.440
they're right.

00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:36.650
"Efficient markets" is not so
easy to define.

00:20:36.650 --> 00:20:43.268
We can go back to--the term
really goes back to 1967 and it

00:20:43.268 --> 00:20:49.545
was Professor Harry Roberts at
University of Chicago who

00:20:49.545 --> 00:20:56.049
defined three different
efficient markets hypotheses.

00:20:56.049 --> 00:21:05.153
There's the weak form,
the semi-strong form,

00:21:05.153 --> 00:21:10.870
and then the strong form.

00:21:14.539 --> 00:21:17.850
The weak form--these differ
only in terms of the amount of

00:21:17.850 --> 00:21:21.451
information that is assumed to
be efficiently incorporated into

00:21:21.451 --> 00:21:25.559
prices.
The weak form says that

00:21:25.559 --> 00:21:34.158
information of past prices is
already in the--incorporated

00:21:34.158 --> 00:21:39.589
into price, but only past
prices.

00:21:39.589 --> 00:21:42.779
What it means "only" is that
you can't predict stock prices

00:21:42.779 --> 00:21:43.990
by noting that,
say,

00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:46.308
if it goes up today,
it'll probably go up tomorrow

00:21:46.308 --> 00:21:48.295
or it goes up today,
it'll probably go down

00:21:48.295 --> 00:21:50.822
tomorrow.
That would be relying only on

00:21:50.822 --> 00:21:53.593
past prices.
Harry Roberts felt most

00:21:53.593 --> 00:21:57.835
confident that this form of the
hypothesis was good,

00:21:57.835 --> 00:22:01.819
so he called it the weak form;
it's the least criticizable

00:22:01.819 --> 00:22:06.008
form of efficient markets.
Semi-strong form says that

00:22:06.008 --> 00:22:11.680
market prices incorporate all
public information.

00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:16.274
Anything that's known to the
public is already incorporated

00:22:16.274 --> 00:22:19.839
into price, so don't bother to
trade on it.

00:22:19.839 --> 00:22:25.884
The strong form says all
information, whether public or

00:22:25.884 --> 00:22:31.697
not, is incorporated into price.
This is a really strong--it's

00:22:31.697 --> 00:22:35.712
the least likely to be true
because every time you increase

00:22:35.712 --> 00:22:40.142
the information set--what strong
form says is that no information

00:22:40.142 --> 00:22:42.769
is private,
really, it all gets out into

00:22:42.769 --> 00:22:45.014
price.
Companies keep secrets,

00:22:45.014 --> 00:22:47.769
so that's not public
information.

00:22:47.769 --> 00:22:50.969
The Securities and Exchange
Commission insists that

00:22:50.969 --> 00:22:54.424
companies keep secrets because
they have to disseminate

00:22:54.424 --> 00:22:58.685
information in an orderly way.
So, there has to be a secret

00:22:58.685 --> 00:23:03.079
until a certain hour in which
it's announced to everybody.

00:23:03.079 --> 00:23:06.448
But the strong form efficient
markets hypothesis is cynical

00:23:06.448 --> 00:23:09.410
about that and says,
you know, nobody keeps secrets,

00:23:09.410 --> 00:23:12.563
it all leaks out.
I think that when we refer to

00:23:12.563 --> 00:23:16.096
the efficient markets
hypothesis, it's the semi-strong

00:23:16.096 --> 00:23:19.696
form that we're usually
referring to because the strong

00:23:19.696 --> 00:23:21.430
form is a bit strong.

00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:31.424
The definitions of efficient
markets that I gave you are

00:23:31.424 --> 00:23:34.994
intuitive but not very precise.
Then you have to ask,

00:23:34.994 --> 00:23:39.352
well what does it mean to say
that price incorporates all

00:23:39.352 --> 00:23:41.671
information?
What does it mean to

00:23:41.671 --> 00:23:44.580
incorporate information?
Unfortunately,

00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:50.883
there's not one answer to that
question, so I'm going to give

00:23:50.883 --> 00:23:55.623
the simplest answer.
What does efficient markets

00:23:55.623 --> 00:24:01.752
mean?
I might--I'll have to--this is

00:24:01.752 --> 00:24:12.791
the simplest version but it's
often the one that is referred

00:24:12.791 --> 00:24:16.951
to most.
That is that price is the

00:24:16.951 --> 00:24:21.322
expected value--the expected
present value--of future

00:24:21.322 --> 00:24:23.760
dividends paid on a stock.

00:24:32.839 --> 00:24:35.594
The efficient markets
hypothesis says,

00:24:35.594 --> 00:24:39.837
the true value of a stock comes
from the dividends that it

00:24:39.837 --> 00:24:44.304
pays--that's a cash flow that is
valued by the market and the

00:24:44.304 --> 00:24:47.505
market values it as the present
value of the

00:24:47.505 --> 00:24:50.930
optimally-forecasted future
dividends.

00:24:50.930 --> 00:24:56.648
The theory that's most often
referred to is the simple--I've

00:24:56.648 --> 00:25:01.979
already talked in the second
lecture about present value

00:25:01.979 --> 00:25:05.034
formulas;
we had a growing-perpetuity

00:25:05.034 --> 00:25:08.897
model.
Remember that I said that the

00:25:08.897 --> 00:25:15.339
present value--the present
discounted value of a growing

00:25:15.339 --> 00:25:21.079
perpetuity that pays an amount
D--well,

00:25:21.079 --> 00:25:31.047
if it pays De^(gt) or
D_0e^(gt) is

00:25:31.047 --> 00:25:35.604
the dividend,
so it's growing at rate,

00:25:35.604 --> 00:25:39.458
g.
Then, the formula we had for

00:25:39.458 --> 00:25:43.160
the present value was
D/(r-g).

00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:44.950
Remember that?

00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:51.486
This assumes,
of course, that the growth of

00:25:51.486 --> 00:25:54.403
dividends has to be less than
the discount rate,

00:25:54.403 --> 00:25:57.809
r.
The simplest version of the

00:25:57.809 --> 00:26:03.105
efficient markets hypothesis
says, price is equal to the

00:26:03.105 --> 00:26:08.785
dividend all over the discount
rate minus the growth rate of

00:26:08.785 --> 00:26:11.165
dividends,
where g,

00:26:11.165 --> 00:26:14.595
the growth rate of dividends,
is an optimally-forecasted

00:26:14.595 --> 00:26:21.773
growth rate of dividend.
That gives us a value--a model

00:26:21.773 --> 00:26:26.038
for the price.
Another way of writing,

00:26:26.038 --> 00:26:29.801
more generally--if I don't
assume the constant growth rate

00:26:29.801 --> 00:26:33.630
of dividends--is to write just a
present value formula.

00:26:33.630 --> 00:26:38.001
It's another less strong form
of writing down the efficient

00:26:38.001 --> 00:26:42.372
markets hypothesis because it
doesn't say how dividends are

00:26:42.372 --> 00:26:47.377
thought to grow.
But you can write:

00:26:47.377 --> 00:26:58.646
price is equal to the summation
of E(D_t+k)]/(1 +

00:26:58.646 --> 00:27:06.950
r)^(k);
k = 1 to infinity.

00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:10.240
This is another--that's just
the present value formula.

00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:16.851
I have the price--I'm sorry,
this should be expectation at

00:27:16.851 --> 00:27:23.578
time, t--the price at
t is the expectation of

00:27:23.578 --> 00:27:28.103
the dividend,
at time t plus k,

00:27:28.103 --> 00:27:32.714
discounted by a discount factor
r. That's just the

00:27:32.714 --> 00:27:37.821
present value formula where I've
substituted an expectation for

00:27:37.821 --> 00:27:43.309
the future dividend.
That's the efficient markets

00:27:43.309 --> 00:27:48.085
theory in this incarnation.
There are other ways to

00:27:48.085 --> 00:27:50.953
envision the efficient
markets--what it means--but

00:27:50.953 --> 00:27:53.059
let's consider this simple
story.

00:27:53.059 --> 00:28:00.141
What this means then is that
the price is a forecast of

00:28:00.141 --> 00:28:05.779
future dividends to be paid on
the stock.

00:28:05.779 --> 00:28:10.746
This would be--of the present
value of future dividends to be

00:28:10.746 --> 00:28:15.049
paid on the stock--and this
means then that price,

00:28:15.049 --> 00:28:21.062
relative to dividend,
is related to expected future

00:28:21.062 --> 00:28:26.980
growth rates of dividends.
If you expect dividends to grow

00:28:26.980 --> 00:28:31.339
a lot, if g is high,
then price will be high,

00:28:31.339 --> 00:28:34.014
relative to dividends,
because this is subtracted off

00:28:34.014 --> 00:28:36.680
the denominator.
It makes the denominator

00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:39.509
smaller and it makes the price
higher.

00:28:39.509 --> 00:28:42.005
On the other hand,
if you expect dividends to do

00:28:42.005 --> 00:28:44.767
poorly in the future,
then price will be low relative

00:28:44.767 --> 00:28:47.056
to dividends;
that's what the efficient

00:28:47.056 --> 00:28:54.595
markets hypothesis would say.
I would give you an example of

00:28:54.595 --> 00:28:57.341
that.
I talked last year about a

00:28:57.341 --> 00:29:00.363
company that I read in
Business Week--that I

00:29:00.363 --> 00:29:02.660
read about in Business
Week,

00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:05.819
so this is a year old story in
Business Week.

00:29:05.819 --> 00:29:10.304
There was a company called
First Federal Financial,

00:29:10.304 --> 00:29:14.250
which was a company that issues
mortgages.

00:29:14.250 --> 00:29:18.197
This was in January of 2007,
actually the Business

00:29:18.197 --> 00:29:21.309
Week story was in December
of 2006,

00:29:21.309 --> 00:29:25.760
but I was still reacting to it
a year ago, in January of 2007.

00:29:30.609 --> 00:29:36.418
The Business Week
story--this is First Federal

00:29:36.418 --> 00:29:43.009
Financial--was referring to the
fact that the price-dividend

00:29:43.009 --> 00:29:49.599
ratio--actually they talked
about price-earnings ratio,

00:29:49.599 --> 00:29:56.539
but the price-earnings ratio
for this company was very low.

00:29:56.539 --> 00:30:09.589
It was only 8.5 in December
2006.

00:30:09.589 --> 00:30:13.518
Typically, price-earnings
ratios of the companies are very

00:30:13.518 --> 00:30:17.240
high, much higher than
that--typically like fifteen.

00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:21.235
The price of First Federal
Financial, relative to its

00:30:21.235 --> 00:30:24.769
earnings, was very low,
so some people might be

00:30:24.769 --> 00:30:28.150
inclined to think well that
looks cheap.

00:30:28.150 --> 00:30:32.035
I can buy--by buying First
Federal Financial,

00:30:32.035 --> 00:30:37.509
I can buy the stock at a low
price relative to its earnings.

00:30:37.509 --> 00:30:41.132
But, if you believe in
efficient markets you wouldn't

00:30:41.132 --> 00:30:44.963
think that this is any reason to
buy the company because

00:30:44.963 --> 00:30:49.351
efficient markets would say that
if the price is low relative to

00:30:49.351 --> 00:30:53.867
either dividends or earnings,
it must mean that people think

00:30:53.867 --> 00:30:57.468
that bad things are going to
come to the dividends or

00:30:57.468 --> 00:30:59.463
earnings.
In other words,

00:30:59.463 --> 00:31:04.116
the First Federal Financial has
a low expected growth rate of

00:31:04.116 --> 00:31:08.550
dividends in the future.
So, I was interested in this

00:31:08.550 --> 00:31:12.979
particular story because
Business Week wrote an

00:31:12.979 --> 00:31:17.994
article about them and noted the
low price-earnings ratio and

00:31:17.994 --> 00:31:20.470
said,
what does this mean?

00:31:20.470 --> 00:31:25.686
What Business Week
presented a year ago was an

00:31:25.686 --> 00:31:30.200
argument why g was likely
to be low.

00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:34.201
Yes?
Student: [inaudible]

00:31:34.201 --> 00:31:40.157
Professor Robert
Shiller: If they don't pay

00:31:40.157 --> 00:31:45.019
dividends you can't use this
formula.

00:31:45.019 --> 00:31:48.829
I'm not sure what the dividends
were at First Federal Financial.

00:31:48.829 --> 00:31:52.009
I only know the price-earnings
ratio at that time.

00:31:52.009 --> 00:31:56.631
You're right,
you cannot use this formula if

00:31:56.631 --> 00:32:02.865
they're not paying a dividend
today because this formula--I

00:32:02.865 --> 00:32:05.982
erased it,
but it was up here--assumes

00:32:05.982 --> 00:32:08.609
that dividends are following a
growth path.

00:32:08.609 --> 00:32:12.109
If they're not paying a
dividend, then we're very

00:32:12.109 --> 00:32:15.609
clearly--that's not an
appropriate assumption.

00:32:15.609 --> 00:32:19.544
Student: So how would
the efficient market theory

00:32:19.544 --> 00:32:23.549
explain prices of companies that
do not pay dividends?

00:32:23.549 --> 00:32:24.119
Professor Robert
Shiller: Right.

00:32:24.119 --> 00:32:26.517
So forâ€“incidentally,
if you know,

00:32:26.517 --> 00:32:30.051
Berkshire Hathaway is the
company Warren Buffett owns and

00:32:30.051 --> 00:32:33.395
it's a very famous company
because it's done extremely

00:32:33.395 --> 00:32:35.585
well.
Warren Buffett is regarded as,

00:32:35.585 --> 00:32:37.630
by many people,
as the financial genius.

00:32:37.630 --> 00:32:41.265
If Berkshire Hathaway is not
paying a dividend,

00:32:41.265 --> 00:32:44.109
we have to revert to this
formula.

00:32:44.109 --> 00:32:48.276
The efficient market theory
would say, well they're going to

00:32:48.276 --> 00:32:52.019
pay a dividend eventually,
so the price reflects these

00:32:52.019 --> 00:32:54.572
future terms.
If you spell this out,

00:32:54.572 --> 00:32:58.197
this is the expected dividend
next year plus the dividend in

00:32:58.197 --> 00:33:01.946
two years--this is divided by (1
+ r)^(2)--the expected

00:33:01.946 --> 00:33:05.203
dividend in three years divided
by (1 + r)^(3),

00:33:05.203 --> 00:33:08.665
etc.
This theory would say that the

00:33:08.665 --> 00:33:13.772
dividend--that Berkshire
Hathaway has value only because

00:33:13.772 --> 00:33:19.529
they--investors expect them to
pay dividends in the future.

00:33:19.529 --> 00:33:23.390
That sounds right because if
Berkshire Hathaway is never

00:33:23.390 --> 00:33:26.759
going to pay dividends,
why would you hold it?

00:33:26.759 --> 00:33:29.133
You might say,
I'll hold it because I could

00:33:29.133 --> 00:33:31.450
sell to someone else at a higher
price.

00:33:31.450 --> 00:33:34.866
But then you say,
well why would anyone else buy

00:33:34.866 --> 00:33:37.089
it?
Look, if they're never going to

00:33:37.089 --> 00:33:39.069
pay a dividend,
what good is it?

00:33:39.069 --> 00:33:43.834
It's just a piece of paper,
unless I can sell to a greater

00:33:43.834 --> 00:33:46.305
fool.
But anyone who buys it is

00:33:46.305 --> 00:33:50.454
either--would be buying it
either on the assumption that

00:33:50.454 --> 00:33:54.603
there's some greater fool coming
or they would be a fool

00:33:54.603 --> 00:33:57.792
themselves.
This theory says that the

00:33:57.792 --> 00:34:02.630
value--if Warren Buffett--of
course, he can't even say this,

00:34:02.630 --> 00:34:04.936
but let's somehow say the
company could say,

00:34:04.936 --> 00:34:08.317
we will never pay a dividend.
This company is going to give

00:34:08.317 --> 00:34:11.871
itself away to charity someday
and you won't get a penny as a

00:34:11.871 --> 00:34:14.455
stockholder.
Well, if that happened the

00:34:14.455 --> 00:34:17.023
price should be zero.
It would convert into a

00:34:17.023 --> 00:34:18.699
non-profit, like Yale
University.

00:34:18.699 --> 00:34:21.599
So what's the price of a share
in Yale University?

00:34:21.599 --> 00:34:24.840
I mean, it's undefined--I its
guess zero, right?

00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:27.659
Because Yale is not
paying--I'll write a piece of

00:34:27.659 --> 00:34:30.010
paper for you and say this is a
share.

00:34:30.010 --> 00:34:32.822
On my authority,
this is a share in Yale

00:34:32.822 --> 00:34:35.841
University.
It might just as well be that

00:34:35.841 --> 00:34:40.004
because it also says in my fine
print, you will never get a

00:34:40.004 --> 00:34:43.420
dividend on this.
So what's the point, right?

00:34:43.420 --> 00:34:47.198
Incidentally,
Microsoft for many years never

00:34:47.198 --> 00:34:50.610
paid a dividend.
It's often common for young

00:34:50.610 --> 00:34:54.348
companies not to pay dividends;
but they did start paying a

00:34:54.348 --> 00:34:57.241
dividend.
The whole theory--efficient

00:34:57.241 --> 00:35:02.550
markets theory--says that that's
what people are looking for.

00:35:02.550 --> 00:35:06.319
That's why the value of a
company is related to its

00:35:06.319 --> 00:35:09.153
activities;
otherwise, if the company never

00:35:09.153 --> 00:35:11.844
paid a dividend,
then what would you care what

00:35:11.844 --> 00:35:14.780
the company is doing?
You only care about it because

00:35:14.780 --> 00:35:16.830
someday they're going to give
you money.

00:35:16.830 --> 00:35:21.091
A lot of investors forget that;
that's a very naïve

00:35:21.091 --> 00:35:23.470
attitude.
They think that somehow stocks

00:35:23.470 --> 00:35:27.252
generate capital gains--prices
go up--but you have to realize

00:35:27.252 --> 00:35:31.098
and efficient markets theory is
saying this: prices only go up

00:35:31.098 --> 00:35:34.880
because there's new information
about future dividends.

00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:39.734
First Financial anyway--this is
an efficient markets

00:35:39.734 --> 00:35:45.635
story--First Financial had a low
P/E, so people were wondering,

00:35:45.635 --> 00:35:49.410
is this a bargain?
This is a cheap stock--P/E

00:35:49.410 --> 00:35:53.264
means price-earnings ratio.
The Business Week

00:35:53.264 --> 00:35:58.205
article pointed out that 40% of
First Federal had been sold

00:35:58.205 --> 00:36:02.380
short--40% of their stock had
been sold short;

00:36:02.380 --> 00:36:04.180
this is a very high level of
shortage.

00:36:04.180 --> 00:36:07.701
You know what means?
That means a lot of investors

00:36:07.701 --> 00:36:10.951
said, "I don't like First
Federal Financial,

00:36:10.951 --> 00:36:14.117
I don't want to invest in it.
Worse than that,

00:36:14.117 --> 00:36:17.047
I want to go and short them."
That means you borrow shares

00:36:17.047 --> 00:36:19.719
and sell them and hope that the
price goes down.

00:36:19.719 --> 00:36:23.280
When you have 40% of the shares
sold short that means that there

00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:26.388
were a lot of people who didn't
believe in First Federal

00:36:26.388 --> 00:36:28.615
Financial.
Business Week,

00:36:28.615 --> 00:36:31.553
in its article,
pointed out that this--First

00:36:31.553 --> 00:36:35.654
Federal Financial was a small
mortgage lender--this is before

00:36:35.654 --> 00:36:39.549
the mortgage crisis that we have
started--in Santa Monica,

00:36:39.549 --> 00:36:42.966
California.
And it was particularly

00:36:42.966 --> 00:36:46.769
innovative, in a sense,
in its lending.

00:36:46.769 --> 00:36:49.898
Notably, 80%,
according to the Business

00:36:49.898 --> 00:36:53.102
Week article,
80% of the mortgages it's

00:36:53.102 --> 00:36:56.968
issued were no-doc mortgages.
Do you know what a no-doc

00:36:56.968 --> 00:36:58.780
mortgage is?
It's something that appeared

00:36:58.780 --> 00:37:01.824
recently in the housing frenzy.
A no-doc mortgage is a mortgage

00:37:01.824 --> 00:37:05.031
where you walk in and say,
"I want to borrow money to buy

00:37:05.031 --> 00:37:06.923
this house."
The company says,

00:37:06.923 --> 00:37:08.929
"Fine we'll give you a
mortgage.

00:37:08.929 --> 00:37:12.863
We won't even ask you to have
your employer send a letter

00:37:12.863 --> 00:37:16.487
saying that you have a job.
We won't even ask you to prove

00:37:16.487 --> 00:37:19.292
that you own anything or
have--we'll just give you the

00:37:19.292 --> 00:37:22.016
mortgage."
That's considered by many

00:37:22.016 --> 00:37:27.150
people risky behavior but it was
done during the housing boom.

00:37:27.150 --> 00:37:31.112
Also, they issued an unusually
high proportion of what are

00:37:31.112 --> 00:37:34.519
called "option ARMs." These are
mortgages that are

00:37:34.519 --> 00:37:39.043
adjustable-rate,
but the person doesn't have to

00:37:39.043 --> 00:37:44.125
pay the full payment every time.
You have the option of paying

00:37:44.125 --> 00:37:47.510
and if you don't want to pay,
you can delay it for a while.

00:37:47.510 --> 00:37:50.207
These are also controversial
because it thought they would

00:37:50.207 --> 00:37:52.099
attract borrowers who were
unreliable.

00:37:52.099 --> 00:37:56.416
Borrowers who thought that they
could afford the house because

00:37:56.416 --> 00:37:59.053
they didn't have to pay now;
but of course,

00:37:59.053 --> 00:38:01.179
it's all going to come later
and then they might default.

00:38:01.179 --> 00:38:05.576
Business Week thought
that the low price-earnings

00:38:05.576 --> 00:38:10.371
ratio was because the market
expected earnings to go down and

00:38:10.371 --> 00:38:13.311
dividends to go down.
A year later,

00:38:13.311 --> 00:38:16.715
that is this morning,
I wanted to see what First

00:38:16.715 --> 00:38:20.674
Federal Financial was doing.
Actually, it's still in

00:38:20.674 --> 00:38:22.880
business;
everything is all right.

00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:32.550
It has positive earnings but
the price was $70 in beginning

00:38:32.550 --> 00:38:40.719
of 2007 and now it's down to
about $40 in 2008.

00:38:40.719 --> 00:38:44.739
This is a testimony to
efficient markets.

00:38:44.739 --> 00:38:48.485
The market was expecting the
price-earnings ratio--they gave

00:38:48.485 --> 00:38:51.850
it a low P/E because they were
worried about--they had

00:38:51.850 --> 00:38:55.342
information that there was
something going badly in this

00:38:55.342 --> 00:38:58.110
company and indeed,
they were right.

00:38:58.110 --> 00:39:01.609
It's not as bad as you might
have thought with the

00:39:01.609 --> 00:39:04.679
Business Week story but
it is bad.

00:39:04.679 --> 00:39:08.933
I guess the lesson--are you
following what I'm talking--what

00:39:08.933 --> 00:39:11.889
happened was they did get into
trouble.

00:39:11.889 --> 00:39:20.717
The low P/E was indeed a
forecaster of bad performance

00:39:20.717 --> 00:39:22.050
later.

00:39:29.289 --> 00:39:33.132
Now, I guess this isn't
exactly--efficient markets

00:39:33.132 --> 00:39:36.897
wouldn't--in this case,
the people who sold First

00:39:36.897 --> 00:39:41.759
Federal Financial short made a
lot of money when the price went

00:39:41.759 --> 00:39:44.722
down so much.
That's not really consistent

00:39:44.722 --> 00:39:47.773
with efficient markets because
it makes it sound like--as a

00:39:47.773 --> 00:39:50.313
matter of fact,
I could have--Reading the

00:39:50.313 --> 00:39:53.820
Business Week article at
the beginning of 2007,

00:39:53.820 --> 00:39:58.179
I could have called my broker
and I could have told my broker,

00:39:58.179 --> 00:40:01.789
shortâ€“please,
I want to short First Federal

00:40:01.789 --> 00:40:03.931
Financial.
I could have done that and it

00:40:03.931 --> 00:40:06.568
looks like I would have made a
lot of money by shorting it

00:40:06.568 --> 00:40:08.280
because the price went down a
lot.

00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:13.215
Efficient markets theory would
have to say that that was an

00:40:13.215 --> 00:40:16.619
anomaly--that that was just good
luck.

00:40:16.619 --> 00:40:19.736
Those people who shorted First
Federal Financial did make a lot

00:40:19.736 --> 00:40:21.897
of money but,
hey, they were just lucky this

00:40:21.897 --> 00:40:23.328
time.
In other words,

00:40:23.328 --> 00:40:27.243
efficient markets theory would
say that the price was already

00:40:27.243 --> 00:40:30.244
down as far as it
would--basically as far as it

00:40:30.244 --> 00:40:33.375
would go in 2007 and that
earnings would fall and

00:40:33.375 --> 00:40:37.420
dividends would fall later and
that would explain why the price

00:40:37.420 --> 00:40:40.167
was low.
But, it wouldn't allow you to

00:40:40.167 --> 00:40:44.472
predict the price.
This anomaly of--the fact that

00:40:44.472 --> 00:40:50.721
it worked out so well is really
not--to short investors--is

00:40:50.721 --> 00:40:55.570
really not testimony to
efficient markets.

00:40:55.570 --> 00:41:01.964
Efficient markets--in some
sense I think I'm sympathetic to

00:41:01.964 --> 00:41:05.419
efficient markets.
You have to be sympathetic to

00:41:05.419 --> 00:41:07.613
some extent.
If I were trying--I actually

00:41:07.613 --> 00:41:10.996
did not short First Federal
Financial when I read this last

00:41:10.996 --> 00:41:14.030
year and it was because,
I guess, I had my doubt;

00:41:14.030 --> 00:41:16.774
I had my feeling.
You read a Business Week

00:41:16.774 --> 00:41:20.149
article and it's--everyone in
the world knows it now that a

00:41:20.149 --> 00:41:22.710
lot people doubt First Federal
Financial.

00:41:22.710 --> 00:41:26.039
If I come in late as a short
seller, am I going to do well?

00:41:26.039 --> 00:41:29.103
I start to doubt it myself
because there are so many people

00:41:29.103 --> 00:41:32.483
looking at it and so many people
who are more knowledgeable about

00:41:32.483 --> 00:41:34.489
First Federal Financial than I
am;

00:41:34.489 --> 00:41:36.829
so, maybe I won't try shorting
it.

00:41:36.829 --> 00:41:39.270
That's what efficient markets
is all about.

00:41:44.679 --> 00:41:51.894
The efficient markets theory
became very popular in finance

00:41:51.894 --> 00:41:59.110
around 1970 and it became a
prominent theory in finance.

00:41:59.110 --> 00:42:04.938
It has a particular incarnation
that I wanted to emphasize

00:42:04.938 --> 00:42:09.603
called "random walk."
The random walk theory,

00:42:09.603 --> 00:42:15.237
which follows loosely from this
formula, though I have to

00:42:15.237 --> 00:42:21.172
qualify it--but let me talk
about random walk as a theory in

00:42:21.172 --> 00:42:25.800
itself.
The random walk theory says

00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:32.260
that under efficient markets,
stock prices and other

00:42:32.260 --> 00:42:37.960
speculative asset prices are
random walks.

00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:43.909
That term goes back to Karl
Pearson in an article in

00:42:43.909 --> 00:42:50.170
Nature in 1905.
This idea is about a hundred

00:42:50.170 --> 00:42:54.265
years old.
What Pearson wrote about

00:42:54.265 --> 00:42:58.824
wasâ€“well,
the example he gave was a

00:42:58.824 --> 00:43:01.932
drunk.
Imagine a person who is so

00:43:01.932 --> 00:43:06.096
drunk that every step that
person takes is random and

00:43:06.096 --> 00:43:09.059
independent of the preceding
step.

00:43:09.059 --> 00:43:14.984
Suppose we--this is a 1905
story--suppose we had a lamppost

00:43:14.984 --> 00:43:20.704
and we had a drunk standing at
the lamppost--I've drawn a

00:43:20.704 --> 00:43:23.504
picture,
that's a lamp post and that's a

00:43:23.504 --> 00:43:25.846
drunk.
This person is so intoxicated

00:43:25.846 --> 00:43:30.231
that steps are completely random
and your objective is to predict

00:43:30.231 --> 00:43:33.039
where will this person be in a
minute,

00:43:33.039 --> 00:43:35.489
in ten minutes,
and twenty minutes.

00:43:35.489 --> 00:43:40.861
Well, Pearson wrote about this
and said that the optimal

00:43:40.861 --> 00:43:47.013
prediction is to assume that the
person in ten minutes--the best

00:43:47.013 --> 00:43:50.920
forecast is the person will be
here.

00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:53.750
In twenty minutes,
what's the best forecast?

00:43:53.750 --> 00:43:57.284
The person will be here.
Of course, they probably won't

00:43:57.284 --> 00:44:00.117
because they're randomly
staggering around but the point

00:44:00.117 --> 00:44:02.949
is that if it's a true random
walk, there's no bias.

00:44:02.949 --> 00:44:05.710
It's equally likely to go this
way or this way.

00:44:05.710 --> 00:44:09.521
The most likely place for the
person is right where that

00:44:09.521 --> 00:44:12.596
person is now.
So Pearson and other people

00:44:12.596 --> 00:44:16.457
following him thought that
speculative prices are like

00:44:16.457 --> 00:44:18.909
that.
That sounds like the markets

00:44:18.909 --> 00:44:22.179
are crazy--they're drunk--but
they're not drunk.

00:44:22.179 --> 00:44:25.789
It's because they respond only
to new information.

00:44:25.789 --> 00:44:29.550
New information is,
by its essence,

00:44:29.550 --> 00:44:33.466
unforecastable.
So, it has to look like the

00:44:33.466 --> 00:44:36.558
market is driven by a drunk
when, in fact,

00:44:36.558 --> 00:44:40.177
it's very precise and
responding optimally to new

00:44:40.177 --> 00:44:43.190
information.
That's one of the paradoxes

00:44:43.190 --> 00:44:46.815
that confuses people.
Statisticians developed the

00:44:46.815 --> 00:44:51.409
theory of a random walk and let
me define that for you.

00:44:51.409 --> 00:44:55.843
A random walk occurs when you
have a variable,

00:44:55.843 --> 00:45:00.573
x, at time,
t, equal to x at

00:45:00.573 --> 00:45:05.795
time (t â€“
1) + e_t where

00:45:05.795 --> 00:45:11.510
e_t is
noise--unforecastable noise.

00:45:11.510 --> 00:45:17.185
This is the random walk;
x would be here--how far

00:45:17.185 --> 00:45:21.727
the person is from the lamppost.
Here's 0, let's say,

00:45:21.727 --> 00:45:25.130
and x is the distance
from the lamppost.

00:45:25.130 --> 00:45:28.101
At every time interval we have
x_t which is

00:45:28.101 --> 00:45:30.670
how far the drunk has deviated
from the lamppost.

00:45:30.670 --> 00:45:33.932
This is the random step;
this is where the drunk was

00:45:33.932 --> 00:45:37.070
last period and this is where
the drunk is this period.

00:45:37.070 --> 00:45:43.163
So that's a random walk.
In the heyday of efficient

00:45:43.163 --> 00:45:47.126
markets theory,
people said that efficient

00:45:47.126 --> 00:45:51.897
markets is working very well.
In other words,

00:45:51.897 --> 00:45:57.825
the random walk hypothesis
describes stock prices very

00:45:57.825 --> 00:46:01.688
well.
Let me go to my spreadsheet,

00:46:01.688 --> 00:46:06.989
which I have up here,
and I'll put this spreadsheet

00:46:06.989 --> 00:46:11.775
up on the web for you.
What I have here is

00:46:11.775 --> 00:46:17.618
shown--there are two lines
shown, one is a blue line,

00:46:17.618 --> 00:46:23.799
which is the--the blue line is
the actual Standard &amp;

00:46:23.799 --> 00:46:30.429
Poor's composite stock price
index going back to 1871.

00:46:30.429 --> 00:46:32.416
This is a series that
Iâ€“well,

00:46:32.416 --> 00:46:35.044
actually I got this series from
Standard &amp;

00:46:35.044 --> 00:46:37.789
Poor's and I emphasize it a lot
in my book.

00:46:37.789 --> 00:46:42.920
It's a 130-year long stock
price series;

00:46:42.920 --> 00:46:45.309
it's monthly for the United
States.

00:46:45.309 --> 00:46:50.150
It's now called the S&amp;P 500
because, starting in 1957,

00:46:50.150 --> 00:46:53.887
Standard &amp;
Poor's kind of reorganized the

00:46:53.887 --> 00:46:57.369
index and they kept it at 500
stocks.

00:46:57.369 --> 00:47:00.939
This is the second most famous
stock price index after the Dow

00:47:00.939 --> 00:47:04.429
Jones Industrial Average.
I think it's better than the

00:47:04.429 --> 00:47:08.181
Dow Jones Industrial Average
because the Dow has only 30

00:47:08.181 --> 00:47:12.341
stocks and this has 500 and it's
representative of most of the

00:47:12.341 --> 00:47:14.630
market.
That's history;

00:47:14.630 --> 00:47:20.189
that blue line there is history.
What I did on Excel was I

00:47:20.189 --> 00:47:26.039
generated a random walk,
because there's a random number

00:47:26.039 --> 00:47:29.874
generator on Excel.
I used the random number

00:47:29.874 --> 00:47:32.490
generator and plugged it into
this formula:

00:47:32.490 --> 00:47:35.356
x_t =
x_t-1 +

00:47:35.356 --> 00:47:39.280
e_t That pink
line is a true random walk.

00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:42.309
It was generated by a random
number generator.

00:47:42.309 --> 00:47:47.250
The point here is--don't they
look kind of similar?

00:47:47.250 --> 00:47:52.549
When you look at--when people
look at stock prices they get

00:47:52.549 --> 00:47:55.514
a--it's an illusion.
This is a psychological

00:47:55.514 --> 00:47:57.670
illusion.
They get the sense that there

00:47:57.670 --> 00:48:01.389
are bull markets when the market
is going up and there are bear

00:48:01.389 --> 00:48:03.849
markets when the market is going
down.

00:48:03.849 --> 00:48:05.889
There must be some force
pushing it up for a while.

00:48:05.889 --> 00:48:09.297
You can see,
for example--I'm looking at the

00:48:09.297 --> 00:48:13.021
blue line--there was a bull
market in the 1920s,

00:48:13.021 --> 00:48:16.349
a famous bull market,
the Roaring 20s.

00:48:16.349 --> 00:48:19.715
You would say,
that just can't be a random

00:48:19.715 --> 00:48:21.582
walk;
it was just going up all the

00:48:21.582 --> 00:48:24.636
time.
Then, this is the 1929 peak and

00:48:24.636 --> 00:48:27.950
there's the crash from 1929 to
1932;

00:48:27.950 --> 00:48:30.916
a big crash.
That can't be a random walk,

00:48:30.916 --> 00:48:33.060
right?
That's what people think.

00:48:33.060 --> 00:48:35.485
They have this intuitive idea.
But, if you look,

00:48:35.485 --> 00:48:38.570
this random walk seems to do
the same thing.

00:48:38.570 --> 00:48:42.077
The pink line has a--look
there's a nice bull market

00:48:42.077 --> 00:48:46.739
there--there's another crash.
Look at this whole period here;

00:48:46.739 --> 00:48:49.260
this was really strong and then
it leveled out.

00:48:49.260 --> 00:48:51.528
We had bad--in fact,
they kind of look similar,

00:48:51.528 --> 00:48:53.633
don't they?
This is pure chance because

00:48:53.633 --> 00:48:56.670
that random walk that I
generated was pure random walk.

00:48:56.670 --> 00:49:01.341
There's the bull--the actual
bull market of the 1950s and 60s

00:49:01.341 --> 00:49:05.389
and my random walk comes out
pretty close to that.

00:49:05.389 --> 00:49:09.748
The random walk theory says
that people are operating under

00:49:09.748 --> 00:49:12.578
illusions;
that there really are no trends

00:49:12.578 --> 00:49:15.130
or there's no way to predict the
market.

00:49:15.130 --> 00:49:17.389
It is just completely
unforecastable.

00:49:17.389 --> 00:49:20.889
Now incidentally,
a nice thing about Excel is I

00:49:20.889 --> 00:49:25.529
can generate a new random walk
for you on the spot by pressing

00:49:25.529 --> 00:49:28.420
F9--if you know that key on
Excel.

00:49:28.420 --> 00:49:31.496
So, I will press F9 and history
is going to stay the same--the

00:49:31.496 --> 00:49:34.623
blue line is going to stay the
same--but the pink line is going

00:49:34.623 --> 00:49:36.732
to change.
I can generate whole

00:49:36.732 --> 00:49:40.658
hundred-year history--pseudo
histories--with a press of a

00:49:40.658 --> 00:49:43.801
button.
Let's see if this works,

00:49:43.801 --> 00:49:47.260
we just got--what is that
saying?

00:49:47.260 --> 00:49:51.077
I put an upward trend to the
random walk there because I

00:49:51.077 --> 00:49:54.409
think there's an up trend to the
stock market.

00:49:54.409 --> 00:49:56.610
It's a little different than
this, I just added a time trend;

00:49:56.610 --> 00:49:59.639
otherwise, it's exactly the
random walk formula that I used.

00:49:59.639 --> 00:50:04.389
Okay, that looks pretty much
like history too except we would

00:50:04.389 --> 00:50:08.110
be in a bear market for quite a
while, right?

00:50:08.110 --> 00:50:11.680
We have quite a bear market in
the pink line but I can correct

00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:16.005
that by pressing F9 again.
This is bad luck,

00:50:16.005 --> 00:50:25.639
the stock market crashed in
the--it went off the chart here;

00:50:25.639 --> 00:50:28.829
that's bad luck but I can try
again.

00:50:28.829 --> 00:50:31.400
Look at that one,
isn't that a beauty?

00:50:31.400 --> 00:50:38.140
That almost--it really looks
like the market we've had.

00:50:43.059 --> 00:50:44.989
So, I can just go--it's just
amazing how fast this thing

00:50:44.989 --> 00:50:45.410
generates.

00:50:49.480 --> 00:50:52.411
I should stop.
Tell me when one looks really

00:50:52.411 --> 00:50:54.190
interesting.
That's an interesting one.

00:50:54.190 --> 00:50:57.608
That's--if that was the history
that we randomly had,

00:50:57.608 --> 00:51:01.291
Jeremy Siegel would write not
just Stocks for the Long

00:51:01.291 --> 00:51:04.104
Run.
He would be jubilant if the

00:51:04.104 --> 00:51:08.827
returns on stocks--he would say
for a hundred years--this is 130

00:51:08.827 --> 00:51:13.326
years--for 130 years stocks have
wonderfully outperformed the

00:51:13.326 --> 00:51:16.250
market--outperformed other
things.

00:51:16.250 --> 00:51:18.769
That is looking pretty good,
isn't it?

00:51:18.769 --> 00:51:22.349
Now, I just press the button
and get--I'm not getting many

00:51:22.349 --> 00:51:23.757
bad ones.
That probably has an uptrend in

00:51:23.757 --> 00:51:23.850
it.

00:51:29.180 --> 00:51:32.814
They all look similar, right?
The other thing I wanted to

00:51:32.814 --> 00:51:36.086
talk about was another thing
called an AR-1,

00:51:36.086 --> 00:51:43.375
which is a different story.
The AR-1--this is the random

00:51:43.375 --> 00:51:45.520
walk, here.

00:51:49.519 --> 00:51:52.719
The other idea is that--let me
do it intuitively first.

00:51:52.719 --> 00:51:57.670
I'm going to tie an elastic
cord around the ankle of the

00:51:57.670 --> 00:52:00.820
drunk and tie it to the
lamppost.

00:52:00.820 --> 00:52:05.524
You see my elastic cord?
It's very loose at the

00:52:05.524 --> 00:52:09.448
beginning so the drunk can move
freely but if it starts to get

00:52:09.448 --> 00:52:11.990
stretchy,
when the drunk makes it all the

00:52:11.990 --> 00:52:14.504
way over here,
then its really hard for--it's

00:52:14.504 --> 00:52:18.847
pulling the drunk back.
That means it biases the drunk

00:52:18.847 --> 00:52:30.864
back towards the starting point.
That's called an AR-1 or a

00:52:30.864 --> 00:52:42.809
first order auto-regressive
model.

00:52:42.809 --> 00:52:46.487
That means that there's
something--the random walk has

00:52:46.487 --> 00:52:48.610
no center;
it just has a starting point.

00:52:48.610 --> 00:52:51.635
It doesn't tend to go back
anywhere, but here we have a

00:52:51.635 --> 00:52:53.889
center.
What do I call that?

00:52:53.889 --> 00:52:57.670
I'll call it--x-bar is
this point here,

00:52:57.670 --> 00:53:00.832
not necessarily 0.
It says that

00:53:00.832 --> 00:53:07.379
(x_t -
x-bar) = x-bar +

00:53:07.379 --> 00:53:11.580
Ï 
(x_t

00:53:11.580 --> 00:53:16.150
_â€“ 1 -
x-bar) +

00:53:16.150 --> 00:53:23.904
e_t.
Ï  lies between

00:53:23.904 --> 00:53:29.870
minus one and positive one;
usually it's positive.

00:53:29.870 --> 00:53:33.754
You see that?
So Ï --the smaller

00:53:33.754 --> 00:53:36.027
Ï  is,
the tighter the elastic cord

00:53:36.027 --> 00:53:38.826
is.
It gets pulled back by 1-

00:53:38.826 --> 00:53:44.088
Ï  of the way back to
the x-bar in every time

00:53:44.088 --> 00:53:46.392
period.
But then there's new noise that

00:53:46.392 --> 00:53:49.002
adds onto it.
If there were no new noise,

00:53:49.002 --> 00:53:52.800
then the drunk would just be
gradually pulled back;

00:53:52.800 --> 00:54:00.955
but there's new noise,
so the drunk is not so

00:54:00.955 --> 00:54:05.243
predictable.
That's another model of the

00:54:05.243 --> 00:54:08.630
stock market but it's not an
efficient markets model.

00:54:08.630 --> 00:54:11.819
The random walk is the
efficient markets model that

00:54:11.819 --> 00:54:15.392
says, you can't profit by
trading because you just cannot

00:54:15.392 --> 00:54:18.757
predict the changing price.
But with the first order

00:54:18.757 --> 00:54:21.359
auto-regressive,
you can predict the change of

00:54:21.359 --> 00:54:26.661
price, at least a little bit.
Well when it's--what goes up

00:54:26.661 --> 00:54:29.860
comes down.
If the drunk is over here,

00:54:29.860 --> 00:54:32.110
it tends to get pulled back
here;

00:54:32.110 --> 00:54:34.809
if the drunk is over here,
it tends to get pulled back up.

00:54:34.809 --> 00:54:37.559
So, that's the random walk
model.

00:54:37.559 --> 00:54:41.030
I programmed into this program
an AR-1.

00:54:41.030 --> 00:54:46.542
I go down here and click on it.
That looks very different,

00:54:46.542 --> 00:54:48.968
doesn't it?
Maybe I didn't get the

00:54:48.968 --> 00:54:51.510
parameters exactly right,
but let me just hit F9;

00:54:51.510 --> 00:54:54.538
I'll get it so it looks better.
Well, it looks a little

00:54:54.538 --> 00:54:56.971
different;
you can see a difference in

00:54:56.971 --> 00:54:59.307
this?
That's because I chose

00:54:59.307 --> 00:55:04.558
Ï  = .95 for that
diagram so it's kind of getting

00:55:04.558 --> 00:55:10.219
tugged back to the trend.
Sometimes it's hard to tell.

00:55:10.219 --> 00:55:13.816
I thought--can you tell the
difference between a random walk

00:55:13.816 --> 00:55:17.212
and an AR-1?
It seems to be coming back

00:55:17.212 --> 00:55:23.393
faster, so that looks different.
Well, with Ï  = .95

00:55:23.393 --> 00:55:29.300
I guess it does look noticeably
different because it's coming

00:55:29.300 --> 00:55:32.545
back pretty fast.
I have 130 years of

00:55:32.545 --> 00:55:36.439
observations and it's coming
back 5% of the way every year,

00:55:36.439 --> 00:55:39.460
so in five years it's 25% of
the way back.

00:55:39.460 --> 00:55:42.908
I've got the cord too tight so
it's not fooling you,

00:55:42.908 --> 00:55:45.178
right?
You can see a difference

00:55:45.178 --> 00:55:48.420
between this AR-1 and the true
stock market.

00:55:48.420 --> 00:55:51.731
The stock--so this is revealing
some truth to the efficient

00:55:51.731 --> 00:55:55.081
markets hypothesis.
What if I made Ï  =

00:55:55.081 --> 00:55:57.075
.99?
Then I think--I should have

00:55:57.075 --> 00:55:59.934
done that instead of .95;
then it gets harder for you to

00:55:59.934 --> 00:56:02.435
see the difference.
If I make Ï  = 1 in

00:56:02.435 --> 00:56:05.452
this--what happens if I plug
Ï  = 1 into this

00:56:05.452 --> 00:56:07.858
expression?
It comes back to the random

00:56:07.858 --> 00:56:11.377
walk because the x-bars
drop out--because you've got

00:56:11.377 --> 00:56:15.018
1*x-bar and you've got
minus x-bar over here so

00:56:15.018 --> 00:56:18.719
they drop out of the equation
and you come back up here.

00:56:18.719 --> 00:56:24.078
A random walk is just an AR-1
with a coefficient--of

00:56:24.078 --> 00:56:29.454
Ï of 1.
Now, the point is then that we

00:56:29.454 --> 00:56:35.021
can easily see that the stock
market is not strongly

00:56:35.021 --> 00:56:39.059
mean-reverting or
trend-reverting.

00:56:39.059 --> 00:56:42.219
It's somewhat--it may be
somewhat trend-revering;

00:56:42.219 --> 00:56:47.099
it's very hard to tell whether
its Ï  is 1 or .99.

00:56:47.099 --> 00:56:51.676
So, that's the point of my
little analysis here,

00:56:51.676 --> 00:56:57.713
of random walk versus AR-1.
Now, the homework--the problem

00:56:57.713 --> 00:57:03.497
set that you will have next
time--now you still haven't

00:57:03.497 --> 00:57:07.460
turned in your second problem
set,

00:57:07.460 --> 00:57:10.239
but I want to work ahead now to
the third one.

00:57:10.239 --> 00:57:14.719
What I want you to do is to try
forecasting the stock market.

00:57:14.719 --> 00:57:19.128
So, let me show you what I did
here and I want you to do

00:57:19.128 --> 00:57:21.970
something.
You could use this spreadsheet

00:57:21.970 --> 00:57:25.230
but I'm also encouraging you to
find your own data.

00:57:25.230 --> 00:57:31.822
Here's my spreadsheet,
which has stock prices back to

00:57:31.822 --> 00:57:34.530
1871.
Can you see all this?

00:57:34.530 --> 00:57:37.449
I have this on my website all
the time;

00:57:37.449 --> 00:57:41.780
I've had it on my website how
long?

00:57:41.780 --> 00:57:48.304
It must be twenty years.
I give it away because I'm the

00:57:48.304 --> 00:57:56.539
person who updates S&amp;P data
for 1871 to the present.

00:57:56.539 --> 00:57:59.286
I now have a relationship with
S&amp;P because they're

00:57:59.286 --> 00:58:01.928
publishing our indices,
but they still don't provide

00:58:01.928 --> 00:58:04.260
updates of this hundred
year-long series.

00:58:04.260 --> 00:58:08.930
So, here it is all the way back
to 1871.

00:58:08.930 --> 00:58:12.776
What do I have here?
I have in column one is the

00:58:12.776 --> 00:58:16.489
Standard &amp;
Poor composite stock price

00:58:16.489 --> 00:58:20.110
index--today called the S&amp;P
500.

00:58:20.110 --> 00:58:24.449
This is the dividend on the
S&amp;P 500.

00:58:24.449 --> 00:58:26.910
They've been paying a dividend
consistently;

00:58:26.910 --> 00:58:30.003
it has never missed a year.
Maybe some companies have

00:58:30.003 --> 00:58:32.441
missed a year,
like Berkshire Hathaway or

00:58:32.441 --> 00:58:35.610
Microsoft, but the whole
aggregate has never missed a

00:58:35.610 --> 00:58:38.271
year.
This is the earnings report on

00:58:38.271 --> 00:58:42.373
the company.
It's all per share so this is

00:58:42.373 --> 00:58:47.155
per share earnings.
I have here the Consumer Price

00:58:47.155 --> 00:58:51.944
Index in this column and then
I've got long-term interest

00:58:51.944 --> 00:58:57.246
rates and I can convert it into
a real price by dividing by the

00:58:57.246 --> 00:59:02.121
Consumer Price Index.
This is the change in the real

00:59:02.121 --> 00:59:05.052
price.
I don't--it's between this year

00:59:05.052 --> 00:59:08.206
and the next year.
What I wanted to do is--this is

00:59:08.206 --> 00:59:11.510
your homework assignment and
maybe I'll come back to this or

00:59:11.510 --> 00:59:14.309
maybe your T.A.'s will come back
to it as well.

00:59:14.309 --> 00:59:17.590
I want you to try to forecast
the stock market.

00:59:17.590 --> 00:59:22.280
What that means--remember what
you're trying to forecast.

00:59:22.280 --> 00:59:25.829
You're trying to forecast
e;

00:59:25.829 --> 00:59:28.530
you're not trying to forecast
x.

00:59:28.530 --> 00:59:30.480
We already know x, it's
easy to forecast;

00:59:30.480 --> 00:59:32.909
it's close to what it was last
period.

00:59:32.909 --> 00:59:36.230
The hard thing is to predict
where the next change will be.

00:59:36.230 --> 00:59:41.252
So, I had to generate a column
of data here,

00:59:41.252 --> 00:59:45.340
which is the change in the
price.

00:59:45.340 --> 00:59:53.933
You see, up here it says J10
minus J9 is the change in the

00:59:53.933 --> 00:59:56.482
price;
that's what you want to try to

00:59:56.482 --> 01:00:00.277
forecast.
I've created this column going

01:00:00.277 --> 01:00:06.413
all the way back to 1871,
showing for each year how much

01:00:06.413 --> 01:00:11.099
the S&amp;P composite index,
in real terms,

01:00:11.099 --> 01:00:13.769
changed.
I did it in logs.

01:00:13.769 --> 01:00:15.949
I took the change in the logs
of real price.

01:00:15.949 --> 01:00:18.230
That's essentially the
percentage change.

01:00:18.230 --> 01:00:20.780
That is going to be hard to
forecast.

01:00:20.780 --> 01:00:23.937
Obviously, it's going to be
hard to forecast because there's

01:00:23.937 --> 01:00:26.559
some truth to the efficient
markets hypothesis.

01:00:26.559 --> 01:00:29.833
If that were easy to forecast,
you could have been rich over

01:00:29.833 --> 01:00:32.330
this period--somebody could have
been rich.

01:00:32.330 --> 01:00:34.420
It can't be that easy.
Nonetheless,

01:00:34.420 --> 01:00:38.427
the problem set for you is to
try to do that--to try to

01:00:38.427 --> 01:00:41.785
forecast it.
What you have to do is go to

01:00:41.785 --> 01:00:45.053
regression analysis.
You don't have to use Excel but

01:00:45.053 --> 01:00:48.220
that's just what I'm suggesting
here because that's the easiest

01:00:48.220 --> 01:00:52.005
thing.
To run a regression,

01:00:52.005 --> 01:01:01.315
you go up to Tools and--let me
see--Data Analysis is down

01:01:01.315 --> 01:01:07.800
here--and then you go to
Regression.

01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:13.291
I guess I have to say "okay."
Then it asks you to fill in

01:01:13.291 --> 01:01:17.739
your "x range" and your
"y range."

01:01:17.739 --> 01:01:26.257
The x-variable is
the--remember the regression

01:01:26.257 --> 01:01:36.085
model is--it's y = Î±
+Î²x + some error

01:01:36.085 --> 01:01:39.501
term,
e or u--I'll call

01:01:39.501 --> 01:01:41.630
it u so we don't get it mixed
up.

01:01:41.630 --> 01:01:45.829
It's asking you to say where
your y-variable is and

01:01:45.829 --> 01:01:49.806
I've got that that my y
variable is in column K,

01:01:49.806 --> 01:01:52.680
because that's what I've
generated.

01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:58.809
That's the change--where is K?
I've lost it;

01:01:58.809 --> 01:02:07.763
it's not column K,
it's--I'm trying to find it

01:02:07.763 --> 01:02:14.130
here--it's column I,
isn't it?

01:02:14.130 --> 01:02:19.092
That's the change in price.
Then the x-variable--I

01:02:19.092 --> 01:02:20.920
can pick some variable to
forecast.

01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:25.054
What I did is I just took
column A, which is time--it's

01:02:25.054 --> 01:02:29.572
just the year--and I ran the
regression since 1950 and I got

01:02:29.572 --> 01:02:35.311
the results here.
I'm just going to show you the

01:02:35.311 --> 01:02:40.269
results from what regression I
ran.

01:02:40.269 --> 01:02:44.369
That's how Excel prints out
regression results.

01:02:44.369 --> 01:02:53.131
The Î±, which is the
intercept, is shown here--so the

01:02:53.131 --> 01:03:01.887
intercept was .05.
The Î²is the coefficient of

01:03:01.887 --> 01:03:08.060
the variable is -2 times
10^(-5).

01:03:08.060 --> 01:03:12.426
You can see now I've struck out;
it doesn't like time as a

01:03:12.426 --> 01:03:15.980
forecaster--it's a very small
coefficient.

01:03:15.980 --> 01:03:19.860
The t-statistic is a
measure of statistical

01:03:19.860 --> 01:03:23.424
significance and the
t-statistic should

01:03:23.424 --> 01:03:27.860
probably be over two for a
statistical significance.

01:03:27.860 --> 01:03:31.792
I've got insignificant
t-statistics for both

01:03:31.792 --> 01:03:36.461
Î± and for Î².
The R^(2) is a measure of what

01:03:36.461 --> 01:03:41.561
fraction of the dependent
variable y's variance I

01:03:41.561 --> 01:03:47.765
have predicted.
It comes out with a fraction of

01:03:47.765 --> 01:03:52.739
.000147--this is a not a
success.

01:03:52.739 --> 01:03:57.108
This is not a get rich quick
story because I'm explaining

01:03:57.108 --> 01:04:00.930
1/10,000th of the variance of
the stock market;

01:04:00.930 --> 01:04:05.244
so I struck out.
I wasn't really trying that

01:04:05.244 --> 01:04:08.690
hard, I just regressed the
returns on time.

01:04:08.690 --> 01:04:14.301
The problem set for you is to
think about seeing if you can

01:04:14.301 --> 01:04:18.746
forecast the market.
You don't have to use my data

01:04:18.746 --> 01:04:23.619
set, you can use others and you
can go online and find them.

01:04:23.619 --> 01:04:26.489
For example,
finance.yahoo.com has a lot of

01:04:26.489 --> 01:04:29.769
indices, but you can find them
on other sites.

01:04:29.769 --> 01:04:35.104
If you find some other data,
you can try to see if you can

01:04:35.104 --> 01:04:37.736
beat me.
I'm not setting up a very high

01:04:37.736 --> 01:04:40.516
standard for success.
If it were this bad,

01:04:40.516 --> 01:04:44.587
efficient markets--well,
this looks good for efficient

01:04:44.587 --> 01:04:45.970
markets theory.

01:04:58.510 --> 01:05:01.215
What I thought you might do for
the problem set is to try to

01:05:01.215 --> 01:05:03.599
think creatively about how to
forecast the market.

01:05:03.599 --> 01:05:06.892
Let me say this:
I'm not--I'm going to have to

01:05:06.892 --> 01:05:11.062
continue with my doubts about
efficient markets in another

01:05:11.062 --> 01:05:14.890
lecture,
but I think that the story has

01:05:14.890 --> 01:05:20.173
a good element of truth to it.
It has to be hard to beat the

01:05:20.173 --> 01:05:24.410
market but it's oversold as
well, especially in academic

01:05:24.410 --> 01:05:29.817
circles--I think us professors,
who are poor are--it's kind of

01:05:29.817 --> 01:05:34.731
a wishful thinking bias.
We're not making much money and

01:05:34.731 --> 01:05:39.830
you can't anyway and so we kind
of tend to overstate efficient

01:05:39.830 --> 01:05:42.752
markets hypothesis.
On the other hand,

01:05:42.752 --> 01:05:46.119
relative to your expectations
as naïve young people,

01:05:46.119 --> 01:05:49.607
it may be a good thing to do to
overstate efficient markets

01:05:49.607 --> 01:05:52.202
hypothesis.
It seems to be a lifecycle

01:05:52.202 --> 01:05:56.158
effect where young people think,
I can surely predict the market

01:05:56.158 --> 01:06:00.560
and then they get beaten down.
Brad Barber and Terry O'Dean

01:06:00.560 --> 01:06:04.388
were professors at UC--at
different campuses of

01:06:04.388 --> 01:06:09.131
California--teamed up with some
economists from Taiwan and

01:06:09.131 --> 01:06:13.708
looked at data of--they got
really good data from Taiwan

01:06:13.708 --> 01:06:17.869
about day traders and their
actual returns.

01:06:17.869 --> 01:06:20.899
Day traders are people who
trade everyday in the markets

01:06:20.899 --> 01:06:24.260
and they found that there was a
really predictable pattern.

01:06:24.260 --> 01:06:28.841
The young people--they start in
as a day trader and they quickly

01:06:28.841 --> 01:06:31.527
lose everything;
they lose badly because they're

01:06:31.527 --> 01:06:34.150
trading too much and they really
can't predict the market.

01:06:34.150 --> 01:06:37.503
There's like 1% of them,
though, who seem like they can

01:06:37.503 --> 01:06:40.785
actually beat the market.
This looks like really good for

01:06:40.785 --> 01:06:44.789
efficient markets.
They found that there are some

01:06:44.789 --> 01:06:51.232
Taiwanese people who know how to
beat the market--1% survives and

01:06:51.232 --> 01:06:53.989
stays in.
Is that contrary to efficient

01:06:53.989 --> 01:06:56.045
markets?
Well, it does seem contrary

01:06:56.045 --> 01:06:59.605
because they found that a small
number of people did find some

01:06:59.605 --> 01:07:02.788
forecasting rule and succeeded.
On the other hand,

01:07:02.788 --> 01:07:06.981
none of the--hardly any of them
got really rich and so it's very

01:07:06.981 --> 01:07:10.510
rare--Warren Buffett is an
extremely rare outcome.

01:07:10.510 --> 01:07:13.536
So it's--I guess,
when I talk about efficient

01:07:13.536 --> 01:07:17.525
markets I want to help prevent
you from suffering under any

01:07:17.525 --> 01:07:20.619
delusions about your forecasting
ability.

01:07:20.619 --> 01:07:23.757
I don't mean that Warren
Buffett can't do it or that you

01:07:23.757 --> 01:07:27.179
can't do it if you develop
yourself into a Warren Buffett.

01:07:27.179 --> 01:07:30.412
The next problem set,
number three,

01:07:30.412 --> 01:07:36.116
asks you to think creatively
about how you would forecast the

01:07:36.116 --> 01:07:41.820
market and to take a stab at it
by running a regression.

01:07:41.820 --> 01:07:45.929
I expect you all to fail--or
almost all of you to fail.

01:07:45.929 --> 01:07:48.829
Your grade will not depend on
your success in forecasting;

01:07:48.829 --> 01:07:52.145
it may even depend inversely
because if you show a big

01:07:52.145 --> 01:07:55.767
success in forecasting,
your teaching assistant will

01:07:55.767 --> 01:07:59.954
look at it very carefully and
try to find some mistake you

01:07:59.954 --> 01:08:02.293
made because,
if you do succeed,

01:08:02.293 --> 01:08:04.957
it's probably a mistake.
On the other hand,

01:08:04.957 --> 01:08:07.691
I don't want to tell you that
you can't because,

01:08:07.691 --> 01:08:11.007
as I said--we're going to come
back to this--I have doubts

01:08:11.007 --> 01:08:14.323
about efficient markets and I
think that you just might be

01:08:14.323 --> 01:08:17.000
able to do it if you're smart
about it.

00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:03.863
Professor Christine
Hayes: We were talking last

00:00:03.863 --> 00:00:06.596
time about the mysterious
episode by the Yabbok River,

00:00:06.596 --> 00:00:09.536
when Jacob undergoes a change
in name, and I mentioned the

00:00:09.536 --> 00:00:12.630
fact that in the biblical view,
the name of something somehow

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.590
encapsulates its very essence.
 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:18.925
Knowing the name of something
gives one power and control over

00:00:18.925 --> 00:00:22.150
that thing.
Many commentators have observed

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.564
that the change in name
accompanies a change in

00:00:25.564 --> 00:00:28.830
character, a change of essence
in Israel.

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.789
So some have noted,
one scholar in particular has

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:35.550
noted that the struggle with the
angel is the final purging of

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.880
the unsavory qualities of
character that marked Jacob's

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.943
past career.
And although Jacob appears to

00:00:41.943 --> 00:00:46.052
be something of an anti-hero--he
actually literally limps into

00:00:46.052 --> 00:00:49.960
the Promised Land alone--Jacob
is a new and honest man.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.590
We see this immediately in his
reunion with Esau.

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.739
He greets his former rival and
enemy with these words--this is

00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:59.799
in Genesis 33:10-11:
"'If you would do me this

00:00:59.799 --> 00:01:01.923
favor,
accept for me this gift,

00:01:01.923 --> 00:01:05.109
for to see your face is like
seeing the face of God,

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:07.030
and you have received me
favorably.

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.691
Please accept my present,
which has been brought to you,

00:01:09.691 --> 00:01:11.870
for God has favored me,
and I have plenty.'

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:15.209
And when he urged him,
he accepted."

00:01:15.209 --> 00:01:19.221
With Jacob, who is now Israel,
God seems perhaps to finally

00:01:19.221 --> 00:01:22.955
have found the working
relationship with humans that he

00:01:22.955 --> 00:01:25.860
has been seeking since their
creation.

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.552
God learned immediately after
creating this unique being,

00:01:29.552 --> 00:01:32.849
that he will exercise his free
will against God.

00:01:32.849 --> 00:01:36.289
God saw that he had to limit
the life span of humans,

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:40.060
or risk creating an enemy that
was nearly equal to him.

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.490
So he casts the humans out of
the Garden, blocks access to the

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.131
tree of life.
But humans continue their

00:01:47.131 --> 00:01:49.676
violent and evil ways,
and in desperation,

00:01:49.676 --> 00:01:52.160
God wipes them out,
and starts again.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.230
This second creation proves to
be not much better.

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:59.000
They forget God,
they turn to idolatry.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.812
God has promised at this point,
however, not to destroy all

00:02:02.812 --> 00:02:05.902
humankind again,
so he experiments with a single

00:02:05.902 --> 00:02:07.480
individual of faith.
 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.740
Abraham's faith withstands many
a trial.

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.109
He is obedient to God in a way
that no one has been up to this

00:02:14.109 --> 00:02:17.298
point in the narrative,
but perhaps ultimately the

00:02:17.298 --> 00:02:20.289
model of blind obedience is
rejected, too.

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:23.292
When Abraham prepares to
slaughter his own son,

00:02:23.292 --> 00:02:27.078
perhaps God sees that blind
faith can be as destructive and

00:02:27.078 --> 00:02:30.802
evil as disobedience,
so God relinquishes his demand

00:02:30.802 --> 00:02:34.080
for blind obedience:
he stops Abraham himself.

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.580
The only relationship that will
work with humans is perhaps one

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.717
in which there is a balance
between unchecked independence

00:02:42.717 --> 00:02:45.877
and blind obedience,
and God seems to find that

00:02:45.877 --> 00:02:47.240
relationship with Jacob.
 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:50.794
And the metaphor for that
relationship is a metaphor of

00:02:50.794 --> 00:02:52.440
struggle, or wrestling.
 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.024
Remember Yisrael means "one who
wrestles, who struggles with

00:02:56.024 --> 00:02:58.033
God."
God and humans lock in an

00:02:58.033 --> 00:03:00.314
eternal struggle,
neither prevailing,

00:03:00.314 --> 00:03:03.546
yet both forever changed by
their encounter with one

00:03:03.546 --> 00:03:07.091
another.
Now the rest of Genesis relates

00:03:07.091 --> 00:03:12.360
the story of Joseph and his
brothers, the 12 sons of Jacob.

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.363
It's one of the most
magnificent psychological dramas

00:03:15.363 --> 00:03:17.470
in the Bible.
The story is intensely human.

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.803
We don't have a lot of
supernatural interference in

00:03:19.803 --> 00:03:21.926
this story.
It focuses very much on the

00:03:21.926 --> 00:03:24.117
family relationships,
on the jealousies,

00:03:24.117 --> 00:03:26.870
very little reference to a
divine perspective.

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.110
It's like a little novella.
 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.917
Scholars are divided over the
authenticity of the Egyptian

00:03:30.917 --> 00:03:32.099
elements in the story.
 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:33.819
You will read radically diverse
things.

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:36.653
Some point to the presence of
Egyptian names,

00:03:36.653 --> 00:03:39.358
and customs,
and religious beliefs and laws

00:03:39.358 --> 00:03:43.158
as a sign of some historical
memory being preserved in these

00:03:43.158 --> 00:03:45.514
stories.
Others point to all the

00:03:45.514 --> 00:03:49.183
problems: the anachronisms,
the general lack of specificity

00:03:49.183 --> 00:03:52.220
as a sign that these are
composed quite late.

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.429
The art of dream interpretation
places a very important role in

00:03:55.429 --> 00:03:58.068
this story, and dream
interpretation was a developed

00:03:58.068 --> 00:03:59.645
science,
particularly in Egypt,

00:03:59.645 --> 00:04:01.904
and the other parts of
Mesopotamia, but the Egyptians

00:04:01.904 --> 00:04:04.379
were known in the ancient world
as dream interpreters.

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:07.173
Joseph is also known for his
ability to interpret dreams,

00:04:07.173 --> 00:04:10.149
but the biblical narrator,
the monotheizing biblical

00:04:10.149 --> 00:04:13.940
narrator, is very concerned to
describe him as reporting what

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.227
God reveals to him,
rather than relying on some

00:04:17.227 --> 00:04:20.180
kind of occult science of
interpretation.

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:24.605
Now Joseph's brothers are
jealous of Jacob's partiality to

00:04:24.605 --> 00:04:28.100
Joseph, and they conspire to be
rid of him.

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.078
But at the last moment,
his brother Judah convinces the

00:04:31.078 --> 00:04:33.449
brothers that,
if instead of killing him,

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:36.347
they sell him,
they can profit a little for

00:04:36.347 --> 00:04:39.651
their troubles.
So Joseph is sold ultimately

00:04:39.651 --> 00:04:43.001
ends up in the household of
Pharaoh in Egypt,

00:04:43.001 --> 00:04:47.569
and his adventures there prove
his meritorious character.

00:04:47.569 --> 00:04:51.136
He rises to a position of great
power when he correctly

00:04:51.136 --> 00:04:54.769
interprets some dreams regarding
an impending famine,

00:04:54.769 --> 00:04:57.658
and with Joseph as the governor
of the country,

00:04:57.658 --> 00:05:01.749
in control of the grain supply,
Egypt successfully weathers

00:05:01.749 --> 00:05:03.470
seven years of famine.
 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:06.708
Now, this famine,
which strikes Canaan as well,

00:05:06.708 --> 00:05:10.509
drives Joseph's brothers to
Egypt in search of food,

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:13.100
and Joseph doesn't reveal
himself to his brothers.

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:14.759
He puts them to the test.
 

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:18.265
He wants to know if they are
the same men who so callously

00:05:18.265 --> 00:05:20.972
broke their father's heart by
selling Joseph,

00:05:20.972 --> 00:05:23.740
his father's favorite,
so many years ago.

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:28.060
In the climatic moment in the
story, Joseph demands that his

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.794
frightened brothers leave
Benjamin--the other son of

00:05:31.794 --> 00:05:34.646
Rachel,
the other son of the beloved

00:05:34.646 --> 00:05:37.790
wife--leave Benjamin as a pledge
in Egypt.

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:41.482
And Joseph knows that it would
decimate his father Jacob to

00:05:41.482 --> 00:05:43.709
lose Rachel's only remaining
son,

00:05:43.709 --> 00:05:46.562
but he's testing his brothers
to see whether they have

00:05:46.562 --> 00:05:49.629
reformed since the day that they
sold him into slavery.

00:05:49.629 --> 00:05:52.231
And indeed Judah,
the one who had figured so

00:05:52.231 --> 00:05:54.410
prominently in the sale of
Joseph,

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:57.821
that had crushed his father,
Judah steps forward and offers

00:05:57.821 --> 00:06:00.938
himself instead of Benjamin:
he says: It would kill my

00:06:00.938 --> 00:06:05.124
father now to lose Benjamin,
the last son of his beloved

00:06:05.124 --> 00:06:07.377
wife, Rachel.
So the brothers,

00:06:07.377 --> 00:06:10.484
having proven their new
integrity--Joseph weeps,

00:06:10.484 --> 00:06:13.790
he reveals his identity in a
very moving scene,

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:16.553
and ultimately the family is
relocated to,

00:06:16.553 --> 00:06:20.058
and reunited in Egypt,
where they live peacefully and

00:06:20.058 --> 00:06:22.620
prosperously for some
generations.

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:26.042
That's the basic outline of the
story of Joseph and his

00:06:26.042 --> 00:06:29.147
brothers, but one of the
important themes of these

00:06:29.147 --> 00:06:32.000
stories is the theme of God's
providence.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.948
The writer wants to represent
Jacob's sons,

00:06:34.948 --> 00:06:38.670
their petty jealousies,
their murderous conspiracy,

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:41.431
Joseph himself,
all as the unwitting

00:06:41.431 --> 00:06:44.430
instruments of a larger divine
plan.

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:48.303
In fact, Joseph says to his
brothers in Genesis 50:20,

00:06:48.303 --> 00:06:51.300
"As for you,
you meant evil against me,

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:54.131
but God meant it for good,
to bring it about that many

00:06:54.131 --> 00:06:56.750
people should be kept alive as
they are today."

00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:00.252
Joseph's betrayal by his
brothers, his decent into Egypt,

00:07:00.252 --> 00:07:03.066
set the stage,
not only for the reformation of

00:07:03.066 --> 00:07:06.270
his brothers' characters,
which is an important part of

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:09.098
the story, but for the descent
of all of the Israelites into

00:07:09.098 --> 00:07:12.453
Egypt,
so as to survive widespread

00:07:12.453 --> 00:07:14.899
famine.
So yet another threat to the

00:07:14.899 --> 00:07:17.776
promise is overcome:
threat of famine is overcome by

00:07:17.776 --> 00:07:19.300
the relocation to Egypt.
 

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:22.932
Significantly,
God says to Jacob in Genesis

00:07:22.932 --> 00:07:26.910
46:4, "I Myself will go down
with you to Egypt,

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:30.629
and I Myself will also bring
you back."

00:07:30.629 --> 00:07:33.300
So, in short,
there seems to be a plan afoot.

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:36.031
The writer wants to represent
God going down there,

00:07:36.031 --> 00:07:37.670
and he will bring them back.
 

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:41.199
Israel's descent to Egypt sets
the stage for the rise of a

00:07:41.199 --> 00:07:44.790
pharaoh who, the text says,
didn't know Joseph and all that

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:46.399
he had done for Egypt.
 

00:07:46.399 --> 00:07:49.372
And this new pharaoh will
enslave the Israelites,

00:07:49.372 --> 00:07:52.532
and so embitter their lives,
that their cry will rise up to

00:07:52.532 --> 00:07:54.920
heaven--the same cry from the
generation of the flood,

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:57.500
the same cry from Sodom and
Gomorrah.

00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:02.062
And thus begins the book of
Exodus, which will lead us from

00:08:02.062 --> 00:08:05.384
Egypt to Sinai.
Most of the narrative account

00:08:05.384 --> 00:08:09.560
in Genesis 12 to 50--with the
exception of the Joseph story,

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:12.932
actually--but most of Genesis
12 through 50 is assigned by

00:08:12.932 --> 00:08:16.776
scholars to the J source,
and certain themes emerge in

00:08:16.776 --> 00:08:19.091
the J narrative.
The first is,

00:08:19.091 --> 00:08:23.336
that while God's promise is
sure, the manner and the timing

00:08:23.336 --> 00:08:26.629
of its fulfillment is quite
unpredictable.

00:08:26.629 --> 00:08:30.567
The land never belongs to the
patriarchs to whom it was

00:08:30.567 --> 00:08:33.126
promised.
Their descendants will take

00:08:33.126 --> 00:08:35.859
possession of it,
but only after tremendous

00:08:35.859 --> 00:08:38.794
struggle.
In other ways God's methods are

00:08:38.794 --> 00:08:41.340
curious.
Why does he go against the

00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:45.623
traditional Ancient Near Eastern
practice of primogeniture,

00:08:45.623 --> 00:08:48.059
inheritance by the first born?
 

00:08:48.059 --> 00:08:51.659
He chooses Jacob,
a liar and a cheat in his early

00:08:51.659 --> 00:08:53.759
life, over the elder Esau.
 

00:08:53.759 --> 00:08:56.906
Why does he choose young
Joseph, who's an arrogant

00:08:56.906 --> 00:08:59.584
spoiled brat?
He provokes his brothers with

00:08:59.584 --> 00:09:01.179
his delusions of grandeur.
 

00:09:01.179 --> 00:09:05.544
Compare the law of
primogeniture that's listed in

00:09:05.544 --> 00:09:09.909
Deuteronomy 21:15-17:
"If a man has two wives,

00:09:09.909 --> 00:09:14.242
one loved, and the other
unloved, and both the loved and

00:09:14.242 --> 00:09:18.565
the unloved have borne him sons,
but the first-born is the son

00:09:18.565 --> 00:09:22.139
of the unloved one-- / when he
wills his property to his sons,

00:09:22.139 --> 00:09:25.892
he may not treat as first-born
the son of the loved one in

00:09:25.892 --> 00:09:29.580
disregard of the son of the
unloved one who is older."

00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:32.200
And yet isn't this what happens
to Ishmael?

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:34.200
Isn't this what happens to Esau?
 

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:37.573
Isn't this what happens to all
of Joseph's brothers who are

00:09:37.573 --> 00:09:40.114
born before him?
And there's no explanation in

00:09:40.114 --> 00:09:42.663
the text.
Yet despite the false starts,

00:09:42.663 --> 00:09:45.397
and the trials,
and the years of famine,

00:09:45.397 --> 00:09:48.520
and the childlessness,
and the infertility,

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:52.564
the seed of Abraham survives,
and the promise is reiterated:

00:09:52.564 --> 00:09:55.580
"I will go down myself with you
to Egypt,

00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:58.340
and I myself will also bring
you back."

00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:01.586
So ultimately,
the J source would appear to

00:10:01.586 --> 00:10:06.610
assert God does control history,
all tends towards his purpose.

00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:09.445
The book of Exodus is really
the sequel, then,

00:10:09.445 --> 00:10:11.019
to the book of Genesis.
 

00:10:11.019 --> 00:10:13.380
Despite God's promise of land
and blessing,

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:16.190
things don't look so good at
the end of Genesis.

00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:19.529
The book closes with the
Israelites residing in Egypt.

00:10:19.529 --> 00:10:23.667
They've managed to procure no
more than a burial plot in the

00:10:23.667 --> 00:10:26.369
Promised Land.
Even God has left his land,

00:10:26.369 --> 00:10:29.938
descending with the Israelites
into Egypt, so the promises and

00:10:29.938 --> 00:10:32.220
their fulfillment seem quite
remote.

00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:35.910
The book of Exodus will relate
the beginning of the process by

00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:38.269
which the promises will be
fulfilled.

00:10:38.269 --> 00:10:41.066
I've just charted the structure
very briefly for you ,

00:10:41.066 --> 00:10:43.809
so you can get your footing in
the book of Exodus.

00:10:43.809 --> 00:10:47.734
The first fifteen chapters tell
the story of Israel in Egypt:

00:10:47.734 --> 00:10:51.070
the rise of a new Pharaoh who
didn't know Joseph;

00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:52.769
the oppression of the
Israelites;

00:10:52.769 --> 00:10:55.259
their enslavement in a state
labor force;

00:10:55.259 --> 00:10:58.070
the killing of all first born
Hebrew males;

00:10:58.070 --> 00:11:01.769
the birth, the early life,
the call of Moses;

00:11:01.769 --> 00:11:04.476
the struggle for freedom,
Moses will plead with the

00:11:04.476 --> 00:11:07.508
Pharaoh to let his people go and
worship their god in the

00:11:07.508 --> 00:11:10.390
wilderness;
and then the final liberation,

00:11:10.390 --> 00:11:14.601
when God does something at the
Reed Sea--we'll talk about that

00:11:14.601 --> 00:11:17.500
later--so that the Israelites
can pass,

00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:21.360
leaving the heavy Egyptian
chariotry to flounder in the

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:24.307
mud.
We have about two-and-a-half

00:11:24.307 --> 00:11:28.533
chapters, 15:22 until chapter
18, that recounts,

00:11:28.533 --> 00:11:31.679
then, the journey towards
Sinai.

00:11:31.679 --> 00:11:33.460
This is a journey that's filled
with complaints.

00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:36.162
The people complain they're
going to starve,

00:11:36.162 --> 00:11:39.429
and God responds with quail,
and manna, and water.

00:11:39.429 --> 00:11:43.133
Chapters 19 to 24 are very,
very important chapters that

00:11:43.133 --> 00:11:46.258
contain the theophany,
the self-revelation of God to

00:11:46.258 --> 00:11:48.235
the Israelites,
and the covenant that's

00:11:48.235 --> 00:11:49.379
concluded at Sinai.
 

00:11:49.379 --> 00:11:53.240
We'll be talking more about
that next time.

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:58.442
Chapters 25 to 40 contain,
beside the unfortunate incident

00:11:58.442 --> 00:12:02.549
with the golden calf which is in
Exodus 32,

00:12:02.549 --> 00:12:06.679
the rest of this unit from 25
to 40, is God's instruction on

00:12:06.679 --> 00:12:09.409
how to build or erect the
tabernacle,

00:12:09.409 --> 00:12:12.141
and then an account of the
Israelites actually

00:12:12.141 --> 00:12:14.570
constructing,
erecting the tabernacle.

00:12:14.570 --> 00:12:18.126
Source critical scholars
believe that J supplies the main

00:12:18.126 --> 00:12:20.350
narrative of this unit in
Exodus.

00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:25.607
It's supplemented by excerpts
from E, and then the addition of

00:12:25.607 --> 00:12:30.692
considerable legal and ritual
and genealogical material from

00:12:30.692 --> 00:12:33.517
P.
Now, the historical value of

00:12:33.517 --> 00:12:38.544
the Exodus story has fascinated
scholars, but also lay people,

00:12:38.544 --> 00:12:41.451
for generations.
Could the Exodus really have

00:12:41.451 --> 00:12:43.580
happened?
And if so, when?

00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:45.320
And does it matter?
 

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:48.477
And is there any evidence for
this story, for example,

00:12:48.477 --> 00:12:50.919
in external sources,
outside the Bible?

00:12:50.919 --> 00:12:54.521
Well, no, there isn't any
direct evidence outside the

00:12:54.521 --> 00:12:57.429
Bible, but let's start at the
beginning.

00:12:57.429 --> 00:13:01.896
We do have a victory hymn,
a victory hymn that's inscribed

00:13:01.896 --> 00:13:06.519
on a stele--that's a slab of
stone--which was erected in the

00:13:06.519 --> 00:13:09.580
year 1204 BCE.
It was erected by a pharaoh,

00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:10.700
Pharaoh Merneptah.
 

00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:13.626
So the stele of Merneptah dates
to about 1204,

00:13:13.626 --> 00:13:17.333
and in this victory hymn he's
boasting of his victory over

00:13:17.333 --> 00:13:21.458
various groups in Canaan,
and one of the groups he claims

00:13:21.458 --> 00:13:23.480
to have defeated is Israel.
 

00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:26.566
Now, this is a fabulously
important inscription,

00:13:26.566 --> 00:13:30.572
because it's the earliest known
reference outside the Bible to

00:13:30.572 --> 00:13:34.250
any person or entity that is
mentioned in the Bible,

00:13:34.250 --> 00:13:38.493
and it suggests that a people
known as Israel was indeed in

00:13:38.493 --> 00:13:43.029
the land of Canaan by the end of
the thirteenth century BCE.

00:13:43.029 --> 00:13:46.431
Whether they arrived there
after an exodus from Egypt is

00:13:46.431 --> 00:13:48.039
not of course indicated.
 

00:13:48.039 --> 00:13:51.161
The source doesn't tell us
that, and in fact there's really

00:13:51.161 --> 00:13:53.259
no archeological evidence of a
group,

00:13:53.259 --> 00:13:55.420
a large group,
entering the land of Canaan at

00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:57.660
this time.
There's a steady cultural

00:13:57.660 --> 00:14:01.357
continuum, not evidence of
destruction as we would expect

00:14:01.357 --> 00:14:02.809
for a big invasion.
 

00:14:02.809 --> 00:14:05.610
We'll talk more about that when
we get to the book of Joshua.

00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:07.967
But nevertheless,
let's just go with this for a

00:14:07.967 --> 00:14:10.991
minute, and if we suppose that
it took about a generation to

00:14:10.991 --> 00:14:13.679
enter the land--so you see,
I've done the math on the side

00:14:13.679 --> 00:14:15.301
here.
I suppose I should have done

00:14:15.301 --> 00:14:17.154
subtractions,
since we're talking BCE,

00:14:17.154 --> 00:14:20.108
but if we put 20 years in for
actually arriving and settling

00:14:20.108 --> 00:14:23.580
in the land,
that takes us to about 1225;

00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:27.220
and if we assume 40 years of
wandering in the desert,

00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:31.000
or wandering from Egypt,
that takes us to about 1265 as

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.820
a date for the Exodus.
 

00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:36.007
Well, in 1265,
the Eighteenth Dynasty's most

00:14:36.007 --> 00:14:39.120
illustrious pharaoh occupied the
throne,

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:42.009
Ramses II--who in fact was
pharaoh for, what,

00:14:42.009 --> 00:14:45.883
70 years, or something…most
of the thirteenth century--and

00:14:45.883 --> 00:14:48.970
he's very famous for his
building projects.

00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:52.683
Now, according to the biblical
record, the Hebrews were set to

00:14:52.683 --> 00:14:55.970
work on urban building projects
in the Delta region,

00:14:55.970 --> 00:14:59.702
at the north part of the
Nile--the delta region of the

00:14:59.702 --> 00:15:02.659
Nile in the cities of Pithom and
Ramses.

00:15:02.659 --> 00:15:06.173
The Bible states that Israel
was in Egypt for 430 years,

00:15:06.173 --> 00:15:08.919
so if we add that,
then that would put their

00:15:08.919 --> 00:15:13.474
descent into Egypt--Joseph,
the other sons of Jacob--around

00:15:13.474 --> 00:15:16.994
the year 1700.
Well, there's a certain appeal

00:15:16.994 --> 00:15:19.874
to that scenario,
because in the 1720s,

00:15:19.874 --> 00:15:24.650
Egypt was invaded and conquered
by a Semitic people known as the

00:15:24.650 --> 00:15:27.680
Hyksos.
They established a dynasty of

00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:30.601
Semitic rulers.
They were centered in the north

00:15:30.601 --> 00:15:33.933
of Egypt, in the area known as
Goshen, so it's possible that

00:15:33.933 --> 00:15:37.209
the pharaohs of the Hyksos
dynasty might have favored other

00:15:37.209 --> 00:15:40.429
Semites: they might have allowed
them to enter in times of

00:15:40.429 --> 00:15:42.813
famine,
and to dwell in the land of

00:15:42.813 --> 00:15:45.881
Goshen, which the Bible
says--the Israelites lived in

00:15:45.881 --> 00:15:47.179
the land of Goshen.
 

00:15:47.179 --> 00:15:49.342
That Joseph,
a Semitic foreigner,

00:15:49.342 --> 00:15:51.910
could be elevated to an
important post,

00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:55.476
the post of governor,
is a little less surprising,

00:15:55.476 --> 00:15:58.289
if we suppose there was a
Semitic regime.

00:15:58.289 --> 00:16:01.311
In the sixteenth century,
the native Egyptians,

00:16:01.311 --> 00:16:04.793
who were smarting and
smoldering under the humiliating

00:16:04.793 --> 00:16:08.685
foreign rule of the Hyksos,
finally succeeded in rising up

00:16:08.685 --> 00:16:11.653
and driving them out,
and reestablishing a native

00:16:11.653 --> 00:16:12.889
Egyptian dynasty.
 

00:16:12.889 --> 00:16:16.405
So some scholars have
speculated that that's the

00:16:16.405 --> 00:16:20.519
historic reality behind the
statement in Exodus 1:18,

00:16:20.519 --> 00:16:22.944
that a new pharaoh,
who knew nothing of Joseph and

00:16:22.944 --> 00:16:26.750
what he had done for Egypt,
began to oppress the Hebrews.

00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:30.145
The feeling is that the
establishment of a new native

00:16:30.145 --> 00:16:33.802
Egyptian dynasty might have led
to the enslavement of any

00:16:33.802 --> 00:16:36.610
remaining Semites or Semitic
outsiders,

00:16:36.610 --> 00:16:39.250
and that would include,
of course, the Hebrews.

00:16:39.250 --> 00:16:42.379
So in all probability,
anyone who was associated with

00:16:42.379 --> 00:16:45.570
the hated occupying regime would
be treated poorly.

00:16:45.570 --> 00:16:47.649
It all seems to fit.
 

00:16:47.649 --> 00:16:50.669
Well, there's a problem with
this theory.

00:16:50.669 --> 00:16:53.914
The Bible itself contains very
contradictory statements

00:16:53.914 --> 00:16:57.279
regarding the length of the
Israelites' stay in Egypt.

00:16:57.279 --> 00:17:03.433
So Exodus 6:16-20 says that the
Israelites were there for only

00:17:03.433 --> 00:17:06.421
four generations,
maybe 80 years,

00:17:06.421 --> 00:17:10.135
from Levi to Moses--Levi was
the great grandfather of

00:17:10.135 --> 00:17:13.777
Moses--so only four
generations--which would mean an

00:17:13.777 --> 00:17:17.420
arrival in Egypt a long time
after the Hyksos,

00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:20.526
not 430 years;
and we don't even know whether

00:17:20.526 --> 00:17:23.556
migration occurred in the Hyksos
period, so what we have really

00:17:23.556 --> 00:17:24.730
is only a hypothesis.
 

00:17:24.730 --> 00:17:28.349
The 430 years number is also
something of an ideal number.

00:17:28.349 --> 00:17:32.360
It places the Exodus 480 years
before Solomon's building of the

00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:35.871
Temple: 480 is a multiple of 12,
and the Bible really likes

00:17:35.871 --> 00:17:38.039
multiples of 12,
so it is an ideal number.

00:17:38.039 --> 00:17:40.915
It's the kind of number that
crops up a lot in biblical

00:17:40.915 --> 00:17:42.992
chronologies,
which makes it suspect for

00:17:42.992 --> 00:17:44.910
other sorts of reasons,
as well.

00:17:44.910 --> 00:17:48.879
So the Hyksos theory is one
that got people very excited for

00:17:48.879 --> 00:17:51.839
a while, but is really not well
supported.

00:17:51.839 --> 00:17:54.750
Still, there's some very
interesting circumstantial

00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:57.951
evidence for Semites engaged in
building projects in the

00:17:57.951 --> 00:18:00.828
thirteenth century,
however and whenever they might

00:18:00.828 --> 00:18:01.920
have gotten to Egypt.
 

00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:05.662
We do know, archaeologically,
that the fortified city of

00:18:05.662 --> 00:18:08.519
Pi-Ramses, very much like Pithom
Ramses,

00:18:08.519 --> 00:18:11.615
was rebuilt in the early
thirteenth century on the site

00:18:11.615 --> 00:18:13.220
of the old Hyksos capital.
 

00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:14.450
There was a capital Avaris.
 

00:18:14.450 --> 00:18:16.640
They had moved the capital up
to the Delta region.

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:18.220
It had fallen into decay.
 

00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:20.767
Now, in the thirteenth century,
this is being rebuilt,

00:18:20.767 --> 00:18:22.450
and that's in the area of
Goshen.

00:18:22.450 --> 00:18:25.126
So the city was being
reoccupied in the time of the

00:18:25.126 --> 00:18:27.427
pharaoh Ramses,
Ramses II, in the thirteenth

00:18:27.427 --> 00:18:29.653
century.
We do know that Egyptian

00:18:29.653 --> 00:18:33.611
officials allowed hungry nomads
to enter the Delta region for

00:18:33.611 --> 00:18:36.910
food: we have records,
written records of this.

00:18:36.910 --> 00:18:39.600
We also know that Semitic
slaves are well attested in

00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:41.876
Egypt at this time,
the end of the thirteenth

00:18:41.876 --> 00:18:44.049
century: we also have records of
that.

00:18:44.049 --> 00:18:47.880
We know of a people called the
Hapiru or 'Apiru.

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:51.869
 
 

00:18:51.869 --> 00:18:55.333
They don't seem to be an ethnic
group so much as a marginalized

00:18:55.333 --> 00:18:57.456
social class,
but some have suggested a

00:18:57.456 --> 00:18:59.579
connection with the word
"Hebrew."

00:18:59.579 --> 00:19:03.057
We know that they worked on the
building of the capital city of

00:19:03.057 --> 00:19:04.860
Ramses II.
Other scholars deny that there

00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:06.330
would be any connection with
"Hebrew."

00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:08.259
The debates are endless.
 

00:19:08.259 --> 00:19:13.907
One thirteenth-century Egyptian
papyrus describes Egypt's tight

00:19:13.907 --> 00:19:17.941
control of her border areas,
and another reports some

00:19:17.941 --> 00:19:20.599
Egyptian officials pursuing some
runaway slaves.

00:19:20.599 --> 00:19:22.686
Obviously this happened from
time to time,

00:19:22.686 --> 00:19:24.059
escaping into the desert.
 

00:19:24.059 --> 00:19:27.609
The Exodus story also contains
many Egyptian elements.

00:19:27.609 --> 00:19:31.347
The names Moses,
Aaron, Pinhas…these are all

00:19:31.347 --> 00:19:35.971
Egyptian names.
"Moses" is simply this part of

00:19:35.971 --> 00:19:40.787
Ramses: Tutmosis,
Ramses, this is Egyptian for

00:19:40.787 --> 00:19:44.319
"born of," born of the God Ra.
 

00:19:44.319 --> 00:19:47.049
And even Moses is an Egyptian
name.

00:19:47.049 --> 00:19:50.305
So none of this,
of course, corroborates the

00:19:50.305 --> 00:19:53.410
specific details of the biblical
story.

00:19:53.410 --> 00:19:56.431
There's no Egyptian record of
the biblical Moses,

00:19:56.431 --> 00:19:59.264
no record of plagues,
no record of a defeat of

00:19:59.264 --> 00:20:01.523
Pharaoh's army.
There is a lot of

00:20:01.523 --> 00:20:04.775
circumstantial evidence,
and some scholars think that

00:20:04.775 --> 00:20:08.152
that lends plausibility to a
story of slaves working on

00:20:08.152 --> 00:20:11.779
building projects who escape
from Egypt at this time,

00:20:11.779 --> 00:20:15.001
and if there's any historical
basis to the Exodus,

00:20:15.001 --> 00:20:19.136
then the most plausible time,
the most plausible backdrop

00:20:19.136 --> 00:20:22.009
would be the thirteenth century
BCE.

00:20:22.009 --> 00:20:26.263
Some scholars assume there's a
historical memory behind the

00:20:26.263 --> 00:20:31.029
elaborate and dramatic story of
a miraculous redemption by God.

00:20:31.029 --> 00:20:33.862
Why would you invent a hero,
a national hero who's entirely

00:20:33.862 --> 00:20:35.619
Egyptian and has an Egyptian
name?

00:20:35.619 --> 00:20:39.411
Why would you invent a myth of
origins in which your ancestors

00:20:39.411 --> 00:20:41.188
are slaves?
Nevertheless,

00:20:41.188 --> 00:20:44.912
as I emphasized earlier in the
patriarchal stories,

00:20:44.912 --> 00:20:48.859
in the end we're dealing here
with sacred history.

00:20:48.859 --> 00:20:52.106
We're dealing with a highly
embellished and theologically

00:20:52.106 --> 00:20:54.599
interpreted myth of origins for
a nation.

00:20:54.599 --> 00:20:58.071
So much more important than
historical verifiability is the

00:20:58.071 --> 00:21:01.184
conviction of the ancient
Israelites who received and

00:21:01.184 --> 00:21:04.242
venerated these traditions,
and developed them,

00:21:04.242 --> 00:21:07.217
and embellished them,
that God had once acted on

00:21:07.217 --> 00:21:10.346
their behalf,
rescuing them from bondage,

00:21:10.346 --> 00:21:14.109
binding them to himself in an
eternal covenant.

00:21:14.109 --> 00:21:16.790
A little bit about the outline
of the story,

00:21:16.790 --> 00:21:20.717
and then we're going to finally
have an introduction between God

00:21:20.717 --> 00:21:23.215
and Moses,
which will I think bring us

00:21:23.215 --> 00:21:25.984
back to some of the
conversations we had at the

00:21:25.984 --> 00:21:27.609
beginning of the course.
 

00:21:27.609 --> 00:21:30.194
So let me first say a little
bit about the story line,

00:21:30.194 --> 00:21:32.584
and some of the themes at the
beginning of Exodus,

00:21:32.584 --> 00:21:34.339
the first six or seven
chapters.

00:21:34.339 --> 00:21:37.191
According to the text,
the Israelites have multiplied,

00:21:37.191 --> 00:21:40.150
they've filled the land of
Goshen that had been given to

00:21:40.150 --> 00:21:42.410
them during Joseph's tenure in
office,

00:21:42.410 --> 00:21:46.098
and this new pharaoh who feared
them--he didn't know Joseph,

00:21:46.098 --> 00:21:48.911
he feared the foreign
presence--he rose and he

00:21:48.911 --> 00:21:51.099
attempted to curb their growth.
 

00:21:51.099 --> 00:21:53.650
He pressed all of the adult
males into slavery.

00:21:53.650 --> 00:21:56.686
The text says "harsh labor at
mortar and brick," but the text

00:21:56.686 --> 00:21:58.609
says, "the more they were
oppressed,

00:21:58.609 --> 00:22:01.571
the more they increased and
spread out," so Pharaoh resorts

00:22:01.571 --> 00:22:02.950
to more drastic measures.
 

00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:06.356
He decrees the murder of all
newborn Israelite males at the

00:22:06.356 --> 00:22:08.060
hands of Egyptian midwives.
 

00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:10.250
He's thwarted by these midwives.
 

00:22:10.250 --> 00:22:11.950
They say: Oh,
these ladies are too quick;

00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:14.037
we get there too late,
they've already given birth by

00:22:14.037 --> 00:22:14.880
the time we arrive.
 

00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:17.049
They allow the male infants to
live.

00:22:17.049 --> 00:22:20.619
So the pharaoh enlists all of
the people to annihilate the

00:22:20.619 --> 00:22:24.440
Israelites by drowning all
newborn males in the Nile River.

00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:27.495
This leads then to the account
of the birth of Moses,

00:22:27.495 --> 00:22:29.670
and his exposure to the Nile
River.

00:22:29.670 --> 00:22:31.369
He is born into a Levite family.
 

00:22:31.369 --> 00:22:34.549
The Levites will be priests in
Israel, so he's born to a

00:22:34.549 --> 00:22:37.019
priestly family.
He's hidden away for three

00:22:37.019 --> 00:22:39.605
months, and then he's placed in
a wicker basket,

00:22:39.605 --> 00:22:43.573
which is lined with bitumen,
a tar, and set among the

00:22:43.573 --> 00:22:47.440
bulrushes at the edge of the
Nile River.

00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:50.500
Pharaoh's daughter will
eventually discover him.

00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:53.078
His own mother will volunteer
to be his nurse,

00:22:53.078 --> 00:22:56.287
and Pharaoh's daughter will
eventually adopt him and name

00:22:56.287 --> 00:22:58.980
his Moses: again,
this is an Egyptian name.

00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:02.349
The etymology given in the
biblical text is invented.

00:23:02.349 --> 00:23:05.650
A lot of scholars have noted
that this story is full of

00:23:05.650 --> 00:23:07.708
irony.
The rescue of Moses,

00:23:07.708 --> 00:23:11.785
who will foil Pharaoh,
is affected by the daughter of

00:23:11.785 --> 00:23:14.572
that pharaoh,
and Moses grows up and is

00:23:14.572 --> 00:23:17.329
sheltered right in the pharaoh's
own palace.

00:23:17.329 --> 00:23:20.922
Further, the significance of
Moses is hinted at through

00:23:20.922 --> 00:23:24.115
literary allusions in the
narrative of his birth,

00:23:24.115 --> 00:23:26.505
his infancy.
The basket in which he is

00:23:26.505 --> 00:23:28.731
placed is called an ark:
the Hebrew word is

00:23:28.731 --> 00:23:31.620
tevah.
This word is used precisely

00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:34.190
twice in the entire Hebrew
Bible.

00:23:34.190 --> 00:23:36.428
It's not the same word that's
used for Ark of the Covenant,

00:23:36.428 --> 00:23:38.242
by the way: the Ark of the
Covenant, the word is

00:23:38.242 --> 00:23:39.983
aron.
This word for ark,

00:23:39.983 --> 00:23:42.104
tevah,
occurs exactly twice:

00:23:42.104 --> 00:23:44.600
here, and in the story of
Noah's ark.

00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:46.380
Noah's ark is a tevah.
 

00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:50.634
Scholars have always been quick
to point out that in both cases,

00:23:50.634 --> 00:23:54.195
this ark, this tevah,
is in the words of one scholar

00:23:54.195 --> 00:23:57.009
"the instrument of salvation
through perilous waters",

00:23:57.009 --> 00:24:01.066
waters that threaten to capsize
it, and so blot out God's hopes

00:24:01.066 --> 00:24:03.029
and plans for his creatures.
 

00:24:03.029 --> 00:24:06.823
Moreover, the basket is placed
among the reeds--the Hebrew word

00:24:06.823 --> 00:24:10.494
for reeds is suph--and
that's a hint or an allusion to

00:24:10.494 --> 00:24:14.226
the fact that Moses will lead
the Israelites through the "Reed

00:24:14.226 --> 00:24:15.740
Sea,"
the Yam Suph.

00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:18.154
It's not the Red Sea,
it's the Reed Sea,

00:24:18.154 --> 00:24:20.569
but we'll talk about that later
also.

00:24:20.569 --> 00:24:25.488
This legendary birth story has
important parallels in Ancient

00:24:25.488 --> 00:24:28.440
Near Eastern and other
literature.

00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:31.958
It's very common to find
stories of the extraordinary

00:24:31.958 --> 00:24:36.153
events that surround the birth
of someone who will later become

00:24:36.153 --> 00:24:41.200
great: Cyrus of Persia,
Oedipus, Jesus, and so on.

00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:44.513
Many scholars have pointed out
that this story in particular is

00:24:44.513 --> 00:24:47.559
paralleled by the birth story of
a great Akkadian king,

00:24:47.559 --> 00:24:52.430
Sargon, from about 2300 BCE,
Sargon of Akkad.

00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:54.319
Strikingly similar story to
Moses.

00:24:54.319 --> 00:24:57.015
placed in a basket lined with
tar, put in the river,

00:24:57.015 --> 00:24:59.188
and so on.
It underscores the degree to

00:24:59.188 --> 00:25:01.606
which this story is part of a
literary genre,

00:25:01.606 --> 00:25:05.189
part of a literary convention,
how much the Exodus story

00:25:05.189 --> 00:25:07.880
itself is very much a literary
story.

00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:12.031
Nothing is said of Moses'
childhood, but we learn of his

00:25:12.031 --> 00:25:14.900
awareness of his Israelite
identity,

00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:18.755
or his identification with the
Hebrews, in the following

00:25:18.755 --> 00:25:21.420
passage: this is in Exodus
2:11-15:

00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:24.291
Some time after that,
when Moses had grown up,

00:25:24.291 --> 00:25:27.500
he went out to his kinsfolk and
witnessed their labors.

00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:30.990
He saw an Egyptian beating a
Hebrew, one of his kinsmen.

00:25:30.990 --> 00:25:33.595
He turned this way and that,
and, seeing no one about,

00:25:33.595 --> 00:25:36.250
he struck down the Egyptian and
hid him in the sand.

00:25:36.250 --> 00:25:38.983
When he went out the next day,
he found two Hebrews fighting,

00:25:38.983 --> 00:25:41.443
and so he said to the offender,
"Why do you strike your

00:25:41.443 --> 00:25:42.578
fellow?"
He retorted,

00:25:42.578 --> 00:25:44.490
"Who made you chief and ruler
over us?

00:25:44.490 --> 00:25:47.400
Do you mean to kill me as you
killed the Egyptian?"

00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:50.217
Moses was frightened and
thought: Then the matter is

00:25:50.217 --> 00:25:51.776
known!
When Pharaoh learned of the

00:25:51.776 --> 00:25:55.230
matter, he sought to kill Moses;
but Moses fled from Pharaoh.

00:25:55.230 --> 00:25:58.171
He arrived in the land of
Midian, and sat down beside a

00:25:58.171 --> 00:26:00.660
well.
So coming to the aid of an

00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:03.535
oppressed kinsman,
Moses kills an Egyptian,

00:26:03.535 --> 00:26:06.890
and he has to flee to the
territory of Midian.

00:26:06.890 --> 00:26:10.093
There at the well,
again he acts to defend the

00:26:10.093 --> 00:26:12.480
defenseless.
This is a key to his character;

00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:16.009
these two episodes are the two
that we're given of Moses' life.

00:26:16.009 --> 00:26:20.083
So continuing verses 16 and 17
in Exodus 2: "Now the priest of

00:26:20.083 --> 00:26:22.019
Midian had seven daughters.
 

00:26:22.019 --> 00:26:25.489
They came to draw water,
and filled the troughs to water

00:26:25.489 --> 00:26:28.406
their father's flock;
but shepherds came and drove

00:26:28.406 --> 00:26:30.575
them off.
Moses rose to their defense,

00:26:30.575 --> 00:26:32.279
and he watered their flock."
 

00:26:32.279 --> 00:26:35.056
So again, this is a key to
Moses' character,

00:26:35.056 --> 00:26:36.670
aiding the defenseless.
 

00:26:36.670 --> 00:26:39.768
Moses will later marry
Zipporah, one of these women,

00:26:39.768 --> 00:26:43.049
and live as a shepherd in
Midian for about 40 years.

00:26:43.049 --> 00:26:46.562
Now, the situation of the
Israelites in Egypt,

00:26:46.562 --> 00:26:49.059
the text says,
remains bitter.

00:26:49.059 --> 00:26:52.000
Exodus 2:23-24:
"The Israelites were groaning

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.339
under the bondage,
and cried out;

00:26:54.339 --> 00:26:57.829
and their cry for help from the
bondage rose up to God.

00:26:57.829 --> 00:27:00.700
God heard their moaning,
and God remembered His covenant

00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:02.579
with Abraham and Isaac and
Jacob."

00:27:02.579 --> 00:27:06.427
One day in the wilderness at a
place called Horeb,

00:27:06.427 --> 00:27:09.490
also Sinai, where there's a
mountain,

00:27:09.490 --> 00:27:13.416
Moses sees a flame in a bush
that doesn't consume the flame,

00:27:13.416 --> 00:27:15.279
and then he hears a voice.
 

00:27:15.279 --> 00:27:17.895
And the voice says,
"I am the God of your father,

00:27:17.895 --> 00:27:20.019
the God of Abraham,
the God of Isaac,

00:27:20.019 --> 00:27:23.056
and the God of Jacob," and
Moses hides his face in fear,

00:27:23.056 --> 00:27:24.160
but God continues.
 

00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:27.453
He has a job for Moses:
"I have marked well the

00:27:27.453 --> 00:27:30.586
plight of my people in Egypt,
and have heeded their outcry

00:27:30.586 --> 00:27:33.808
because of the taskmaster;
yes, I am mindful of their

00:27:33.808 --> 00:27:35.823
sufferings.
And I've come down to rescue

00:27:35.823 --> 00:27:38.215
them from the Egyptians,
and to bring them out of that

00:27:38.215 --> 00:27:39.839
land to a good and spacious
land,

00:27:39.839 --> 00:27:42.545
a land flowing with milk and
honey, the region of the

00:27:42.545 --> 00:27:44.646
Canaanites, the Hittites,
the Amorites,

00:27:44.646 --> 00:27:46.094
the Perizzites,
the Hivites,

00:27:46.094 --> 00:27:47.220
and the Jebusites.
 

00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:49.450
Now the cry of the Israelites
has reached me.

00:27:49.450 --> 00:27:52.309
Moreover I have seen how the
Egyptians oppress them.

00:27:52.309 --> 00:27:54.689
Come, therefore,
I will send you to Pharaoh,

00:27:54.689 --> 00:27:57.124
and you shall free my people,
the Israelites,

00:27:57.124 --> 00:27:59.880
from Egypt."
[Exodus 3:7-10]

00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:02.529
Moses demurs: Who me?
 

00:28:02.529 --> 00:28:06.082
Why not my big brother Aaron,
he's a much better public

00:28:06.082 --> 00:28:08.144
speaker?
This is the line that he takes:

00:28:08.144 --> 00:28:09.049
I'm slow of tongue.
 

00:28:09.049 --> 00:28:13.144
But as we've already seen in
Genesis, God chooses whom he

00:28:13.144 --> 00:28:16.799
chooses, and his reasons aren't
always fathomed.

00:28:16.799 --> 00:28:21.130
Moses says: May I say who sent
me?

00:28:21.130 --> 00:28:23.210
He asks for God's name.
 

00:28:23.210 --> 00:28:26.700
The Israelites will want to
know who has sent me,

00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:30.119
and God replies with a
sentence, "Ehyeh asher

00:28:30.119 --> 00:28:33.210
ehyeh."
This is a first person sentence

00:28:33.210 --> 00:28:36.630
that can be translated,
"I am who I am," or perhaps,

00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:40.632
"I will be who I will be," or
perhaps, "I cause to be what I

00:28:40.632 --> 00:28:43.079
cause to be."
We really don't know,

00:28:43.079 --> 00:28:45.869
but it has something to do with
"being."

00:28:45.869 --> 00:28:49.209
So he asks who God is,
God says, "I am who am I am" or

00:28:49.209 --> 00:28:52.170
"I will cause to be what I will
cause to be."

00:28:52.170 --> 00:28:54.717
So Moses, wisely enough,
converts that into a

00:28:54.717 --> 00:28:57.554
third-person formula:
okay, he will be who he will

00:28:57.554 --> 00:28:59.099
be,
he is who he is,

00:28:59.099 --> 00:29:03.374
"Yahweh asher Yahweh."
God's answer to the question of

00:29:03.374 --> 00:29:07.370
his name is this sentence,
and Moses converts it from a

00:29:07.370 --> 00:29:11.646
first-person to a third-person
sentence: he will be who he will

00:29:11.646 --> 00:29:13.349
be;
he is who he is;

00:29:13.349 --> 00:29:16.858
he will cause to be,
I think most people think now,

00:29:16.858 --> 00:29:20.155
what he will cause to be,
and that sentence gets

00:29:20.155 --> 00:29:21.980
shortened to "Yahweh."
 

00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:25.718
This is the Bible's explanation
for the name Yahweh,

00:29:25.718 --> 00:29:28.210
and as the personal name of
God,

00:29:28.210 --> 00:29:32.579
some have argued that the name
Yahweh expresses the quality of

00:29:32.579 --> 00:29:35.240
being, an active,
dynamic being.

00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:38.299
This God is one who brings
things into being,

00:29:38.299 --> 00:29:42.263
whether it's a cosmos from
chaos, or now a new nation from

00:29:42.263 --> 00:29:44.279
a band of runaway slaves.
 

00:29:44.279 --> 00:29:47.713
But it could well be that this
is simply God's way of not

00:29:47.713 --> 00:29:49.430
answering Moses' question.
 

00:29:49.430 --> 00:29:51.658
We've seen how the Bible feels
about revealing names,

00:29:51.658 --> 00:29:53.843
and the divine being who
struggled and wrestled with

00:29:53.843 --> 00:29:55.900
Jacob sure didn't want to give
him his name.

00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:59.243
So I've often wondered if we're
to read this differently:

00:29:59.243 --> 00:30:00.929
Who am I?
I am who I am,

00:30:00.929 --> 00:30:02.400
and never you mind.
 

00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:06.652
There are certain important and
unique features of this burning

00:30:06.652 --> 00:30:09.788
bush dialogue.
First God identifies himself to

00:30:09.788 --> 00:30:12.880
Moses as the God of Abraham,
Isaac, and Jacob,

00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:16.027
and as numerous commentators
have pointed out,

00:30:16.027 --> 00:30:18.895
in so doing,
the biblical writer is trying

00:30:18.895 --> 00:30:22.741
to establish an unbroken
historic continuity between the

00:30:22.741 --> 00:30:26.500
present revelation to Moses,
and the revelations and

00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:29.620
promises that are received by
Israel's forefathers,

00:30:29.620 --> 00:30:33.203
the patriarchs.
And yet, paradoxically,

00:30:33.203 --> 00:30:36.871
the very assertion of
continuity only serves to

00:30:36.871 --> 00:30:40.220
underscore a fundamental
discontinuity,

00:30:40.220 --> 00:30:43.120
because even as God asserts
that he is the God of the

00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:45.630
patriarchs, he reveals to Moses
a new name,

00:30:45.630 --> 00:30:48.773
Yahweh, so that Yahwism,
and the Yahweh cult,

00:30:48.773 --> 00:30:51.559
can be said to begin only with
Moses.

00:30:51.559 --> 00:30:55.179
Now, as we've seen,
the biblical sources differ on

00:30:55.179 --> 00:30:57.942
this point.
According to the J source,

00:30:57.942 --> 00:31:01.063
in Genesis 4:26,
the earliest humans worshiped

00:31:01.063 --> 00:31:02.450
Yahweh as Yahweh.
 

00:31:02.450 --> 00:31:03.650
The name was always known.
 

00:31:03.650 --> 00:31:07.900
J wants to assert a direct
continuity between the God of

00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:11.299
the patriarchs,
and the God of the Exodus.

00:31:11.299 --> 00:31:14.619
The P and E sources tell it a
little differently.

00:31:14.619 --> 00:31:18.859
Exodus 6:2-4,
a very important passage,

00:31:18.859 --> 00:31:22.764
is assigned to P,
and here God says,

00:31:22.764 --> 00:31:26.005
"I am.
I appeared to Abraham,

00:31:26.005 --> 00:31:31.898
Isaac and Jacob as El Shaddai,
but I did not make Myself known

00:31:31.898 --> 00:31:34.119
to them by My name."
 

00:31:34.119 --> 00:31:39.595
Now, this contradicts the J
source, and many scholars have

00:31:39.595 --> 00:31:45.455
suggested that P and E preserve
a memory of a time when Israel

00:31:45.455 --> 00:31:49.009
worshipped the Canaanite god,
El.

00:31:49.009 --> 00:31:52.757
P and E wish to claim that the
God who covenanted with the

00:31:52.757 --> 00:31:56.900
patriarchs is the God of the
Exodus, but now with a new name.

00:31:56.900 --> 00:31:59.651
They also, like J,
want to assert a continuity,

00:31:59.651 --> 00:32:02.462
but in doing so,
they do it in a way that really

00:32:02.462 --> 00:32:06.289
ultimately draws attention to
the fundamental discontinuity,

00:32:06.289 --> 00:32:07.910
the sense of a new
beginning.

00:32:07.910 --> 00:32:10.940
To understand that new
beginning, we need to look at

00:32:10.940 --> 00:32:13.554
the differences between
patriarchal religion,

00:32:13.554 --> 00:32:14.980
and the new Yahwism.
 

00:32:14.980 --> 00:32:17.364
There's a list on your handout,
so I hope everyone got a copy

00:32:17.364 --> 00:32:18.803
of the handout.
If you didn't,

00:32:18.803 --> 00:32:21.803
perhaps you can raise your
hand, and if the TFs have any

00:32:21.803 --> 00:32:24.749
left -- you'll want to take a
look at these differences

00:32:24.749 --> 00:32:27.640
between patriarchal religion and
Mosaic Yahwism,

00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:28.930
and this is going to help us.
 

00:32:28.930 --> 00:32:32.165
This list is based on
information that's supplied by

00:32:32.165 --> 00:32:35.096
many scholars.
I've relied very much on

00:32:35.096 --> 00:32:37.970
Michael Coogan,
but others as well.

00:32:37.970 --> 00:32:41.744
Look first at the sheet that
gives you the titles of God,

00:32:41.744 --> 00:32:45.653
and you'll see that in the
patriarchal traditions--so we're

00:32:45.653 --> 00:32:50.096
talking about Genesis primarily;
I've thrown in some other texts

00:32:50.096 --> 00:32:54.193
also, but focusing for a moment
on the patriarchal traditions of

00:32:54.193 --> 00:32:57.250
Genesis--God is six times called
El Shaddai.

00:32:57.250 --> 00:33:00.530
Other names are El 'Elyon,
and El Olam,

00:33:00.530 --> 00:33:02.430
El Ro'i, El Beyt El.
 

00:33:02.430 --> 00:33:05.273
You can see the translations of
these: the everlasting God,

00:33:05.273 --> 00:33:06.842
God most high,
the God of seeing,

00:33:06.842 --> 00:33:08.950
the God of the house of God,
and so on.

00:33:08.950 --> 00:33:14.140
El is the name of the chief God
in the Canaanite pantheon.

00:33:14.140 --> 00:33:17.008
Flip over to the other side of
your handout,

00:33:17.008 --> 00:33:20.344
where I discuss an important
set of texts that were

00:33:20.344 --> 00:33:23.280
discovered at a place called Ras
Shamra.

00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:26.200
Ras Shamra was ancient Ugarit.
 

00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:30.674
In 1928, a peasant in Syria
discovered a tomb at Ras Shamra,

00:33:30.674 --> 00:33:34.390
which was subsequently
excavated by the French,

00:33:34.390 --> 00:33:38.075
and it was found to contain a
library of tablets that were

00:33:38.075 --> 00:33:40.950
written in a language very,
very close to biblical Hebrew.

00:33:40.950 --> 00:33:43.367
It's clear that Hebrew is
simply a Canaanite dialect--in

00:33:43.367 --> 00:33:45.960
fact, I remember reading one
scholar who said if you go back

00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:48.665
far enough,
you'd be really hard pressed to

00:33:48.665 --> 00:33:52.293
tell the difference between
Canaanite and Hebrew--and in

00:33:52.293 --> 00:33:55.526
these texts we read of the
exploits of the gods of

00:33:55.526 --> 00:33:57.109
Canaanite religion.
 

00:33:57.109 --> 00:34:01.464
These gods include the sky god,
El, I've listed here,

00:34:01.464 --> 00:34:05.150
the father of the various gods
and humans.

00:34:05.150 --> 00:34:08.599
El has a wife,
Asherah: she's listed third on

00:34:08.599 --> 00:34:11.924
your paper, a mother goddess;
their daughter,

00:34:11.924 --> 00:34:14.310
Anat, who is a goddess of love
and war.

00:34:14.310 --> 00:34:15.239
She's quite fierce.
 

00:34:15.239 --> 00:34:18.969
And then their son,
Baal, who is a storm god.

00:34:18.969 --> 00:34:24.042
He's depicted in mythological
literature as defeating both the

00:34:24.042 --> 00:34:27.534
chaotic sea god,
Yam, and the god of death,

00:34:27.534 --> 00:34:30.287
Mot.
There are striking resemblances

00:34:30.287 --> 00:34:34.596
between the biblical gods of the
Patriarchs and the Canaanite god

00:34:34.596 --> 00:34:37.166
El.
El is the head of a council of

00:34:37.166 --> 00:34:39.337
gods.
He is said to have a long white

00:34:39.337 --> 00:34:42.092
beard.
He dwells on a mountaintop in a

00:34:42.092 --> 00:34:45.128
tent.
His epithets include "Father of

00:34:45.128 --> 00:34:47.789
all creatures," "Bull," "King."
 

00:34:47.789 --> 00:34:50.727
He's also described as the
protector of patriarchs,

00:34:50.727 --> 00:34:53.488
patriarchal figures,
"a God of the father of the

00:34:53.488 --> 00:34:55.310
clan," it says in the text.
 

00:34:55.310 --> 00:34:57.180
He guides them.
He protects them.

00:34:57.180 --> 00:34:59.780
He promises them descendants.
 

00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:03.131
Many biblical passages depict
God exactly this way,

00:35:03.131 --> 00:35:06.079
as the head of a council of
divine beings.

00:35:06.079 --> 00:35:09.103
He's occasionally described
with some of the epithets that

00:35:09.103 --> 00:35:10.429
are associated with El.
 

00:35:10.429 --> 00:35:12.619
He's referred to as the father
of all creatures.

00:35:12.619 --> 00:35:14.762
There are poetic passages in
which he is referred to as

00:35:14.762 --> 00:35:16.730
"Bull."
Also certainly as "King."

00:35:16.730 --> 00:35:19.607
And in the patriarchal
narratives, God refers to

00:35:19.607 --> 00:35:21.750
himself as the God of the
Father.

00:35:21.750 --> 00:35:24.969
"I am the God of the father,"
the same way El is referred to.

00:35:24.969 --> 00:35:27.289
He guides and protects the
patriarchs.

00:35:27.289 --> 00:35:31.130
He makes promises of progeny to
Abraham and his heirs.

00:35:31.130 --> 00:35:33.448
He also is associated with a
mountaintop, Sinai,

00:35:33.448 --> 00:35:36.309
and gives instructions for the
building of a tabernacle,

00:35:36.309 --> 00:35:38.909
a tent-like structure,
in which he will dwell.

00:35:38.909 --> 00:35:43.257
Many personal and place names
in the patriarchal narratives

00:35:43.257 --> 00:35:46.480
are compounds in which one
element is El.

00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:49.760
Israel, Ishmael, Beth-el.
 

00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:53.019
El is the God of the Patriarchs.
 

00:35:53.019 --> 00:35:55.605
By contrast,
after the time of Moses,

00:35:55.605 --> 00:35:58.764
Israelite names start to be
formed using Yah,

00:35:58.764 --> 00:36:02.714
or Yahu, as part of the name
Yahweh: Elijah in Hebrew is

00:36:02.714 --> 00:36:05.350
Eliyahu.
So you start to have

00:36:05.350 --> 00:36:09.018
theophorics, names that use a
name of a deity,

00:36:09.018 --> 00:36:12.849
which are using forms of Yahu
instead of El.

00:36:12.849 --> 00:36:16.210
There are other descriptions in
the Bible of God,

00:36:16.210 --> 00:36:19.010
which are much more
reminiscent, however,

00:36:19.010 --> 00:36:20.900
of the storm god,
Baal.

00:36:20.900 --> 00:36:24.026
According to Canaanite
mythology, Baal defeated El,

00:36:24.026 --> 00:36:27.841
and assumed his position at a
certain point as the head of the

00:36:27.841 --> 00:36:30.756
Canaanite pantheon,
so there was a switch in

00:36:30.756 --> 00:36:33.463
Canaanite mythology,
from El to Baal becoming

00:36:33.463 --> 00:36:35.822
supreme.
Like Baal, Yahweh is said to

00:36:35.822 --> 00:36:38.587
ride on the clouds:
we have a poetic passage in

00:36:38.587 --> 00:36:40.090
which that's the case.
 

00:36:40.090 --> 00:36:43.596
His revelations are accompanied
by thunderstorms,

00:36:43.596 --> 00:36:46.809
earthquakes:
Baal is the god of the storm.

00:36:46.809 --> 00:36:50.654
There are poetic fragments also
that allude to Yahweh's victory

00:36:50.654 --> 00:36:53.516
over water foes,
and that is a motif that's

00:36:53.516 --> 00:36:56.875
associated with Baal,
who does battle with the Yam,

00:36:56.875 --> 00:36:58.674
with the sea.
And finally,

00:36:58.674 --> 00:37:01.937
also associated with Israel's
God, we have Ancient Near

00:37:01.937 --> 00:37:03.809
Eastern holy war traditions.
 

00:37:03.809 --> 00:37:07.803
God is depicted as a warrior,
who leads his host,

00:37:07.803 --> 00:37:10.300
the Lord of hosts in battle.
 

00:37:10.300 --> 00:37:13.130
He's armed with spear and bow
and arrows.

00:37:13.130 --> 00:37:16.691
The worship practices of
ancient Israel and Judah clearly

00:37:16.691 --> 00:37:19.871
resemble what we know of
Canaanite and Ancient Near

00:37:19.871 --> 00:37:21.780
Eastern worship practices.
 

00:37:21.780 --> 00:37:26.137
Canaanite religious ritual took
place in small temples that

00:37:26.137 --> 00:37:27.940
housed cultic statues.
 

00:37:27.940 --> 00:37:30.768
There were stone pillars,
perhaps symbols of the gods,

00:37:30.768 --> 00:37:32.210
or memorials to the dead.
 

00:37:32.210 --> 00:37:35.710
There were altars for animal
sacrifices, cereal,

00:37:35.710 --> 00:37:37.199
liquid sacrifices.
 

00:37:37.199 --> 00:37:39.874
Similarly, Israel's gods,
or Israel's God,

00:37:39.874 --> 00:37:43.723
was worshiped at various high
places: they're referred to as

00:37:43.723 --> 00:37:45.550
elevated or high places.
 

00:37:45.550 --> 00:37:49.280
They were shrines with little
altars, maybe cultic pillars,

00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:52.046
and wooden poles:
the word for a wooden pole

00:37:52.046 --> 00:37:55.070
that's used in the Bible is
asherah.

00:37:55.070 --> 00:37:59.038
These shrines may have been
associated with some kind of

00:37:59.038 --> 00:38:03.079
contact with ancestors,
some kind of cult of the dead.

00:38:03.079 --> 00:38:06.592
Now, worship at these local
altars and high places would

00:38:06.592 --> 00:38:09.211
come to be banned:
Deuteronomy is going to

00:38:09.211 --> 00:38:11.000
polemicize against this.
 

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:14.277
Deuteronomy will insist that
all worship must occur in one

00:38:14.277 --> 00:38:16.692
central sanctuary and these
outlying areas,

00:38:16.692 --> 00:38:19.510
and their asherot are to
be destroyed.

00:38:19.510 --> 00:38:23.257
It will decree the destruction
of all of these altars and high

00:38:23.257 --> 00:38:25.354
places.
The patriarchal stories are

00:38:25.354 --> 00:38:27.699
clearly not the work of the
Deuteronomist,

00:38:27.699 --> 00:38:31.131
and these stories must have had
very longstanding traditional

00:38:31.131 --> 00:38:34.621
authority if they were adopted
without serious modification by

00:38:34.621 --> 00:38:37.710
the Deuteronomist redactor--
some modification,

00:38:37.710 --> 00:38:40.789
but not serious.
So what is going on here?

00:38:40.789 --> 00:38:45.015
What are we to make of the
incredible similarity of

00:38:45.015 --> 00:38:49.409
Israel's deity and cult to those
of her neighbors?

00:38:49.409 --> 00:38:52.768
How are we to understand the
rise of Israel's God,

00:38:52.768 --> 00:38:54.139
Israel's religion?
 

00:38:54.139 --> 00:38:58.199
Well, so far we've had two
models that have been thrown out

00:38:58.199 --> 00:39:01.630
to you: the kind of classic
evolutionary model.

00:39:01.630 --> 00:39:06.597
From polytheism's worship of
many gods there's a natural

00:39:06.597 --> 00:39:11.113
evolution to henotheism's
elevation of one god to a

00:39:11.113 --> 00:39:13.010
supreme position.
 

00:39:13.010 --> 00:39:16.497
One comes to be favored and
then eventually becomes so

00:39:16.497 --> 00:39:20.116
important, the others really
fall away, and you have the

00:39:20.116 --> 00:39:22.420
denial of all gods but the one.
 

00:39:22.420 --> 00:39:26.190
We saw Kaufman in the 1930s
reacted against this.

00:39:26.190 --> 00:39:29.126
He argued that monotheism and
polytheism are so radically

00:39:29.126 --> 00:39:32.115
distinct that one could not
possibly have evolved from the

00:39:32.115 --> 00:39:35.400
other.
Surely there's an element of

00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:37.570
truth in both models.
 

00:39:37.570 --> 00:39:40.882
The evolutionary model is,
I think, responding to,

00:39:40.882 --> 00:39:44.194
and picking up on,
the fact that in many respects,

00:39:44.194 --> 00:39:47.710
Yahweh resembles the gods of
Israel's neighbors.

00:39:47.710 --> 00:39:50.605
To be blunt,
the patriarchs seem to have

00:39:50.605 --> 00:39:53.130
worshiped the Canaanite God,
El.

00:39:53.130 --> 00:39:55.845
The problem with the
evolutionary model is that it

00:39:55.845 --> 00:39:58.783
doesn't account for those
aspects of the biblical text

00:39:58.783 --> 00:40:01.887
that show a clear polemical
relationship between Israel's

00:40:01.887 --> 00:40:04.159
religion and that of her
neighbors.

00:40:04.159 --> 00:40:07.283
Now, we saw when we read
Genesis 1, that there was

00:40:07.283 --> 00:40:10.789
something going on there,
there's a polemic going on.

00:40:10.789 --> 00:40:14.193
There are strata within the
Bible that are clearly

00:40:14.193 --> 00:40:17.666
polemicizing against a certain
kind of mythological

00:40:17.666 --> 00:40:19.750
presentation of the deity.
 

00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:23.030
By contrast,
Kaufman's revolutionary model

00:40:23.030 --> 00:40:27.510
focuses almost exclusively on
the dissimilarities and the

00:40:27.510 --> 00:40:31.590
polemical relationship between
Yahwism and Canaanite

00:40:31.590 --> 00:40:34.870
polytheism.
the revolutionary model also

00:40:34.870 --> 00:40:37.958
fails because it doesn't
acknowledge the many,

00:40:37.958 --> 00:40:41.800
many areas of contact,
similarity, and even identity.

00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:45.393
So a third way has emerged in
the last 20 years,

00:40:45.393 --> 00:40:48.758
or 15 years or so,
and it's one that seeks to

00:40:48.758 --> 00:40:53.269
avoid this dichotomy between
polytheism and monotheism.

00:40:53.269 --> 00:40:56.938
Instead of viewing Israelite
religion as an evolution from

00:40:56.938 --> 00:40:59.834
and a refinement--just this
natural process of

00:40:59.834 --> 00:41:02.280
refinement--of Canaanite
religion,

00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:06.039
or as a radical break
with and polemic against

00:41:06.039 --> 00:41:08.932
Canaanite religion,
we have some biblical

00:41:08.932 --> 00:41:10.161
scholars--Mark S.
 

00:41:10.161 --> 00:41:13.776
Smith is among them,
and Steven Geller--who examine

00:41:13.776 --> 00:41:17.970
the cultural and ideological
negotiations that gave rise to

00:41:17.970 --> 00:41:20.140
Israelite monotheism.
 

00:41:20.140 --> 00:41:23.331
What do I mean?
Mark Smith specifically

00:41:23.331 --> 00:41:26.820
describes the origin and
development of Israelite

00:41:26.820 --> 00:41:30.673
religion as a process of what he
calls convergence and

00:41:30.673 --> 00:41:33.939
differentiation.
He writes, "Convergence

00:41:33.939 --> 00:41:37.191
involved the coalescence of
various deities,

00:41:37.191 --> 00:41:41.730
and/or some of their features
into the figure of Yahweh".

00:41:41.730 --> 00:41:46.550
There's a period of convergence
and blending of the deities.

00:41:46.550 --> 00:41:49.459
By contrast,
he describes differentiation as

00:41:49.459 --> 00:41:53.451
a process whereby Israel came to
reject its Canaanite roots,

00:41:53.451 --> 00:41:55.820
and create a separate identity.
 

00:41:55.820 --> 00:41:58.320
At some point there was a
desire to separate,

00:41:58.320 --> 00:42:00.820
and in that process of identity
formation,

00:42:00.820 --> 00:42:04.906
a polemic began to develop that
created Yahweh in a distinct

00:42:04.906 --> 00:42:08.300
way, differentiated from the
Canaanite deities.

00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:11.519
So let's consider Smith's
convergence first.

00:42:11.519 --> 00:42:15.280
The Canaanite roots of Israel's
ancestors are clear.

00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:18.640
The Hebrew language itself is
essentially Canaanite,

00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:20.090
a Canaanite dialect.
 

00:42:20.090 --> 00:42:24.097
The Canaanite god El was,
from the biblical text,

00:42:24.097 --> 00:42:27.519
the God of Israel's earliest
ancestors.

00:42:27.519 --> 00:42:30.040
Through a process of
convergence, he argues:

00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:33.674
the God Yahweh was the god that
we think originally came from a

00:42:33.674 --> 00:42:35.764
region further south,
Sinai, Edom,

00:42:35.764 --> 00:42:38.780
somewhere further south--but
this god, through a process of

00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:41.744
convergence and cultural mixing,
began to take on the

00:42:41.744 --> 00:42:44.147
characteristics of other
deities, first El,

00:42:44.147 --> 00:42:47.522
and then Baal,
or sort of simultaneously El

00:42:47.522 --> 00:42:50.775
and Baal.
Later, certain aspects of this

00:42:50.775 --> 00:42:55.405
convergence would be polemicized
against, and rejected as a

00:42:55.405 --> 00:43:00.036
Yahweh-only party sought to
differentiate itself from those

00:43:00.036 --> 00:43:03.070
that it would now label as
other,

00:43:03.070 --> 00:43:06.909
and call Canaanites,
as distinct from Israelites.

00:43:06.909 --> 00:43:11.194
Smith's model of convergence
and then differentiation,

00:43:11.194 --> 00:43:13.619
has great explanatory power.
 

00:43:13.619 --> 00:43:16.966
It explains the deep similarity
of Israel's deity and the

00:43:16.966 --> 00:43:20.223
deities of her neighbors,
but it also explains the

00:43:20.223 --> 00:43:23.920
vehement biblical polemic
against Canaanite religion,

00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:26.889
and Baal worship in particular,
which we will come to see.

00:43:26.889 --> 00:43:30.230
It reminds one of sibling
rivalry.

00:43:30.230 --> 00:43:33.262
Siblings who obviously share a
tremendous amount,

00:43:33.262 --> 00:43:36.484
and can be extraordinarily
similar are precisely the

00:43:36.484 --> 00:43:39.517
siblings who can struggle and
wrestle the most to

00:43:39.517 --> 00:43:42.550
differentiate themselves from
one another.

00:43:42.550 --> 00:43:46.360
Smith's model of convergence
and differentiation also avoids

00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:47.909
unhelpful dichotomies.
 

00:43:47.909 --> 00:43:52.194
Israel is either like or unlike
her neighbors--that's not

00:43:52.194 --> 00:43:55.000
helpful.
It helps us understand Israel's

00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:58.619
God as the end product of
familiar cultural processes,

00:43:58.619 --> 00:44:01.606
processes of convergence--we
see convergences of cultures all

00:44:01.606 --> 00:44:03.199
the time--and differentiation.
 

00:44:03.199 --> 00:44:06.139
Differentiations of culture
happen all the time as well.

00:44:06.139 --> 00:44:07.894
When and why,
you may ask,

00:44:07.894 --> 00:44:10.210
did this differentiation occur?
 

00:44:10.210 --> 00:44:13.923
When and why did some
Israelites adopt a Yahweh-only

00:44:13.923 --> 00:44:17.564
position, and seek to
differentiate what they would

00:44:17.564 --> 00:44:20.549
call a pure Yahwism from the
cult of Baal,

00:44:20.549 --> 00:44:23.182
for example?
The debate over that question

00:44:23.182 --> 00:44:26.010
is fierce, and it's one we're
going to leave for another day.

00:44:26.010 --> 00:44:28.438
We will come back,
as we continue moving through

00:44:28.438 --> 00:44:30.608
the biblical text,
and we will address that

00:44:30.608 --> 00:44:32.206
question.
But to sum up,

00:44:32.206 --> 00:44:35.976
it's clear that the biblical
patriarchs and matriarchs are

00:44:35.976 --> 00:44:39.217
not strict Yahwists,
as we will come to understand

00:44:39.217 --> 00:44:42.954
that term.
The P and the E sources

00:44:42.954 --> 00:44:47.542
preserve this insight;
and they preserve it in their

00:44:47.542 --> 00:44:50.719
insistence that the Patriarchs
worshiped God as El,

00:44:50.719 --> 00:44:54.849
but at the time of the Exodus,
God revealed himself as Yahweh.

00:44:54.849 --> 00:44:58.623
There's an interesting passage
in the book of Joshua,

00:44:58.623 --> 00:45:01.518
Joshua 24:14-15.
Joshua was the successor to

00:45:01.518 --> 00:45:04.013
Moses.
He presents the Israelites with

00:45:04.013 --> 00:45:07.105
the following choice:
"Now therefore revere the

00:45:07.105 --> 00:45:09.235
Lord,"
using the word Yahweh,

00:45:09.235 --> 00:45:12.217
"revere Yahweh,
and serve him with undivided

00:45:12.217 --> 00:45:14.433
loyalty.
Put away the gods that your

00:45:14.433 --> 00:45:17.500
forefathers served beyond the
Euphrates and in Egypt"--put

00:45:17.500 --> 00:45:20.783
away the gods your forefathers
served beyond the Euphrates and

00:45:20.783 --> 00:45:22.559
in Egypt--"and serve Yahweh.
 

00:45:22.559 --> 00:45:25.796
/ Choose this day which ones
you are going to serve,

00:45:25.796 --> 00:45:29.539
but I in my household will
serve Yahweh," serve the Lord.

00:45:29.539 --> 00:45:33.199
Only later would a Yahweh-only
party polemicize against and

00:45:33.199 --> 00:45:37.110
seek to suppress certain… what
came to be seen as undesirable

00:45:37.110 --> 00:45:39.760
elements of Israelite-Judean
religion,

00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:42.400
and these elements would be
labeled Canaanite,

00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:45.570
as a part of a process of
Israelite differentiation.

00:45:45.570 --> 00:45:49.469
But what appears in the Bible
as a battle between Israelites,

00:45:49.469 --> 00:45:51.543
pure Yahwists,
and Canaanites,

00:45:51.543 --> 00:45:54.781
pure polytheists,
is indeed better understood as

00:45:54.781 --> 00:45:57.949
a civil war between Yahweh-only
Israelites,

00:45:57.949 --> 00:46:01.663
and Israelites who are
participating in the cult of

00:46:01.663 --> 00:46:03.000
their ancestors.

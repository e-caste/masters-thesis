00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:05.390
PROFESSOR: So what I want to
do in today's lecture is to

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:10.400
move us on to a topic not
unrelated to the one that we

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.750
were addressing before
March break.

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.530
So as you recall, what we were
thinking about before March

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:23.100
break were the relations that
people bear to one another as

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.080
far as moral responsibility
goes.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.130
You might think the first part
of the course, the part on

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.080
flourishing, was about human
beings as individuals and the

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.450
ways in which, within
themselves, they might achieve

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.190
a certain kind of harmony.

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.670
The second part of the course
was about morality, about

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.930
interpersonal relations
between individuals.

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.910
And the third part of the
course, which we'll move to in

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.460
earnest next week, is about how
political structures might

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.870
play a role in cultivating
certain kinds of behavior on

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:58.510
the part of individuals.

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:00.480
Obviously, that's
an idealization.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.980
Individuals considered in
isolation are always in

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.770
interaction with others.

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.200
Individuals in pairwise
relations are always embedded

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.830
within larger communities.

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.470
But the arc of the course has
been to move from individuals,

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.500
to small groups of individuals,
to larger groups

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:18.966
of individuals.

00:01:18.966 --> 00:01:24.710
And the punishment unit, which
is just two lectures long, is

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.440
in some ways a transitional
unit between the morality

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.960
section and the political
philosophy section.

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.590
So what I want to do in our
running start, to get people

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.980
back thinking about the
questions that we've been

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.306
thinking about, is
to start with a

00:01:41.306 --> 00:01:42.660
couple of clicker questions.

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.410
So I hope that your clickers
didn't get

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.404
lost over March break.

00:01:48.404 --> 00:01:53.090
And to begin by asking you to
think about a couple of cases

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:58.650
in real life, tragically, that
have the structure that

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.910
Trolley problems do.

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.949
And then we'll move on to some
cases more directly related to

00:02:04.949 --> 00:02:06.440
punishment.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.770
So you remember that we devoted
a reasonable amount of

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.870
class attention to thinking
about an abstract and

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.730
idealized moral dilemma
situation, which is sometimes

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.500
called the Trolley
Bystander case.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.880
There's a trolley which is about
to run into five people.

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.940
There's a bystander next to it,
who realizes that there's

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.450
an alternative track on which
only one person is standing.

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.890
And that bystander faces the
choice of whether to divert

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.850
the threat, the trolley, from
the track where there are the

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:42.010
five to the track where
there are the one.

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:47.190
Tragically, the world has found
itself with something

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:56.400
like an actual trolley case, in
the form of the effusion of

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:02.340
radioactive clouds from the
Japanese nuclear power plant.

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.360
So suppose you were--

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.870
this is the first clicker
question--

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:12.020
the Japanese Prime Minister, and
it were evident that the

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:16.420
radioactive cloud was heading
towards Tokyo, with a

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.200
population of roughly 13
million, and there was the

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:27.470
possibility of diverting the
cloud to the countryside, to

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:32.720
an area with a population
of roughly one million.

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.850
Your clicker question is this:
would it be, one, morally

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:42.770
mandatory to redirect the plume
from the 13 million to

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:46.910
the 1 million, two, morally
permitted but not morally

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.700
mandatory, or three,
morally prohibited?

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.930
So let's see how the
numbers come out.

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:00.300
One second remaining.

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.460
And let's see.

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:07.270
So 31 percent of you think it
would be morally mandatory to

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:11.626
redirect, 56 percent think it
would be morally permitted,

00:04:11.626 --> 00:04:16.490
and 13 percent think it would
be morally prohibited.

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:20.890
Now, let me show you how you
thought about this question

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:24.100
when we presented it abstractly,
as a simple

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:25.940
trolley problem.

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:30.310
More than twice as many of you,
looking at these numbers,

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:35.700
31 percent, as opposed to 15
percent, think that it's

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:39.400
morally mandatory in
the actual case to

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.832
redirect the plume.

00:04:41.832 --> 00:04:43.315
That's interesting.

00:04:43.315 --> 00:04:46.462
It's interesting
methodologically, because it's

00:04:46.462 --> 00:04:49.860
interesting to ask why a real
world case is giving you a

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.860
different sort of response than
a hypothetical case is.

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.470
But it's also interesting
methodologically to notice

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:01.510
that on the prohibition, the
numbers were almost identical.

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:04.530
15 percent of you thought
it was prohibited in the

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:06.240
imaginary case.

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.530
15 percent of you, actually 13
percent of you, thought it was

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:12.800
prohibited in the actual case.

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:16.550
So there's a way in which it
appears that these imaginary

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:22.020
cases are tracking, in their
abstraction, the same sort of

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:26.530
considerations that the actual
cases are, and ways in which

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:27.730
they aren't.

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:30.480
And I encourage you, in the
context of your sections and

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:34.960
your conversations amongst
yourselves, to think about why

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:37.720
that might be.

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.810
But in addition to being a
straight trolley problem, the

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:46.280
traditional Bystander case,
in the case of the nuclear

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:51.720
tragedy in Japan, there's also
something not very different

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:55.710
from what we might call
the Harm's Way case.

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:58.230
So you'll recall that the second
kind of case that we

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:01.000
thought about in the context of
trolleys concerned a case

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.270
where a trolley is hurtling
down a track towards five

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:09.826
individuals, and resting over
the track is a person who, if

00:06:09.826 --> 00:06:15.550
you put him into harm's way,
could prevent the death of the

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:18.300
other five.

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:21.560
How would that go in the actual

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:24.660
situation that we now face?

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:30.620
Same nuclear accident, same
prime minister, same 13

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:36.760
million people, but now, as the
Prime Minister, you face

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:42.350
the possibility of conscripting
into certain

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:50.730
death a small group of
engineers, whose work on the

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:55.650
plant in, for example, regaining
electricity, or

00:06:55.650 --> 00:07:00.040
pouring water in places that
would be inaccessible due to

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:02.270
radioactivity to anybody
whom you weren't

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:03.870
sending to certain death.

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:08.830
Individuals who are in a
position to save the lives of

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:14.180
these 13 million, through the
sacrifice of an incredibly

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:17.148
small number of individuals.

00:07:17.148 --> 00:07:22.130
The question is this: for the
Prime Minister, supposing that

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:27.290
the job involves conscripting
workers to go, the plant is

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:31.590
about to explode and bring with
it an enormous amount of

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:35.440
radiation to an enormous number
of people, would it be

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:39.440
morally mandatory, one, morally
permitted but not

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:44.100
morally mandatory, or morally
prohibited to conscript the

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:47.930
workers, sending them
to certain death?

00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:57.270
So the numbers here are
actually extremely

00:07:57.270 --> 00:08:00.930
interesting, when I show them to
you in comparison with the

00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:02.215
abstract case.

00:08:02.215 --> 00:08:06.270
So your numbers here are 27
percent say it's prohibited,

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:08.990
41 percent say it's
permitted but not

00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:11.050
prohibited, whereas only--

00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:15.570
sorry, 41 percent say it's
permitted but not mandatory,

00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:20.280
and only 32 percent think it
would be morally prohibited to

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:23.660
conscript the workers in a way
that would bring about their

00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:25.360
certain death.

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:28.350
How did your numbers look
in the fat man case?

00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:31.809
They looked very different
indeed.

00:08:31.809 --> 00:08:34.645
Just to show you, here
were your numbers

00:08:34.645 --> 00:08:36.720
in the actual case.

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:40.220
Roughly 32 percent of you
thought it was prohibited,

00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:44.480
more than twice as many thought
it prohibited in the

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:46.410
case of fat man.

00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:51.120
Now, is that because, as Josh
Greene suggests, when a

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:55.680
situation is up close and
personal, the way you imagine

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:59.630
engaging in the pushing action
somehow plays a role, as

00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:03.330
either a legitimate or
illegitimate moral heuristic,

00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:06.160
whereas in the case where you're
imagining conscripting

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:10.880
the workers, what you're doing
is somehow more distant, in

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:13.884
terms of the harm's way into
which you're putting it?

00:09:13.884 --> 00:09:18.410
Is the difference that, in the
case of the workers it feels

00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:20.890
more like a statistical harm?

00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:24.990
And as Cass Sunstein suggests,
statistical harms are in some

00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:28.480
ways harder for us to process?

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:32.980
Is what's going on in your
different response to the

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:38.370
Prime Minister case somehow that
the numbers 13 million

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:42.550
versus a small number
change the calculus?

00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:45.120
But if they change the calculus,
then it couldn't

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:48.672
have been that any violable
right was driving your

00:09:48.672 --> 00:09:50.890
response in fat man.

00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:56.740
So for those of you who are in
the vast majority of having

00:09:56.740 --> 00:10:02.400
moved your position--note that
mandatory went up, prohibited

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:06.890
went down, permitted went up--I
want you to think about

00:10:06.890 --> 00:10:11.530
what kind of moral reasoning
explains the difference in

00:10:11.530 --> 00:10:16.280
your response to this actual
Prime Minister case and the

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:18.340
imaginary Fat Man case.

00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:21.450
And as always, these slides
will be online for you by

00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:24.010
later today for you to
have a chance to look

00:10:24.010 --> 00:10:27.590
closely at the numbers.

00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:31.480
So the cases that we've been
considering so far, the cases

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:35.420
where earthquakes bring about
natural disasters that cause

00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:39.250
great harm to people,
are tragedies.

00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:42.400
But they're tragedies with
respect to which it's hard to

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:46.865
know where to direct our
dissatisfaction at the state

00:10:46.865 --> 00:10:48.550
of the world.

00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:52.760
There's very little that we can
do to prevent things like

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:54.820
earthquakes from happening.

00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:57.790
And although there are
precautions that we can take

00:10:57.790 --> 00:11:02.860
with respect to things like
nuclear power plants, again

00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:06.110
there are features of the
world with which it's

00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:10.880
difficult for us to
exert control.

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:14.880
What we moved to in the lectures
right before March

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:18.750
break, in the context of moral
luck, were instances where the

00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:23.785
wrong-doing that concerned us
was perpetuated not by an

00:11:23.785 --> 00:11:28.870
impersonal agency, like an
earthquake, but rather by an

00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:30.190
individual.

00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:35.240
And so we considered, for
example, the four cases of the

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:38.040
driver on their way
home from work.

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:42.840
Lucky Alert, who simply drove
home, Unlucky Alert, who drove

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:48.510
home alert and unfortunately hit
a child, Lucky Cell Phone,

00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:54.240
who drove home as none of you
ever do, I'm sure, talking on

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:59.480
his cell phone, and Unlucky
Cell Phone, who drove home

00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:02.925
talking on his cell phone and
tragically hit a child.

00:12:02.925 --> 00:12:06.150
So I'm going to show you two of
your numbers from before,

00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:09.690
and then ask you one more
clicker question.

00:12:09.690 --> 00:12:14.730
Nearly all of you, 95 percent
of you, thought that Lucky

00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:18.330
Alert did nothing morally
blame-worthy in driving home.

00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:20.800
Remember, we stipulated that we
weren't talking about the

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:23.180
ways in which his carbon
footprint might be

00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:27.890
contributing to various kinds of
global problems. The issue

00:12:27.890 --> 00:12:30.180
was just whether he did
something morally wrong in

00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:34.330
driving home, and 95 percent of
you thought that he didn't.

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:39.800
By contrast, 92 percent of you,
nearly everyone in the

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:44.290
class, thought that Unlucky Cell
Phone, the one who was

00:12:44.290 --> 00:12:47.520
talking on his phone and hit
the child, did something

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:49.880
morally blame-worthy.

00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:52.200
The question that I want to ask
you now, if you'll take

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:56.420
out your clickers, is whether
Unlucky Cell Phone, the person

00:12:56.420 --> 00:13:00.000
who was talking on his phone
and hit the child, did

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.370
something that merits
punishment.

00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:06.810
And with that, we'll move into
the central topic of our

00:13:06.810 --> 00:13:09.010
discussion today and Thursday.

00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:12.820
So did Unlucky Cell Phone
do something that merits

00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:19.140
punishment in driving home and
talking on his cell phone and,

00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:20.910
unfortunately, hitting
the child?

00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:23.290
Let's see how our numbers
come out.

00:13:23.290 --> 00:13:24.400
94 percent of you--

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:27.790
Wow, even more of you think he
deserves punishment than think

00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:29.040
he did something wrong.

00:13:31.882 --> 00:13:34.174
Great class!

00:13:34.174 --> 00:13:40.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.810
What I want to do in the next
two classes is to think

00:13:44.810 --> 00:13:50.310
seriously with you about
this rather perplexing

00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:54.550
philosophical and psychological
phenomenon.

00:13:54.550 --> 00:14:00.920
The fact that when somebody does
something wrong, and we

00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:04.280
perceive the person, or we
perceive the perpetrator of

00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:08.420
the wrongdoing, as having had
a certain sort of agency,

00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:14.360
there is, across cultures and
across time, a tendency to

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:20.150
think that that individual is
deserving of punishment.

00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:23.120
So the questions that
I want to ask in

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:26.170
today's lecture are three.

00:14:26.170 --> 00:14:29.930
I want to start out by
presenting you with a classic

00:14:29.930 --> 00:14:34.620
characterization of civil
punishment, so that we have a

00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:37.490
sense of what it is that we're
talking about, and in so

00:14:37.490 --> 00:14:40.710
doing, I'll present you with one
that Pojman summarized in

00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:46.680
the outline reading that I had
you do today, that comes from

00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:50.420
mid-1950's work in analytic
legal theory.

00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:53.810
So I'm going to ask what it is
that we mean, when we talk

00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:56.550
about civil or criminal
punishment.

00:14:56.550 --> 00:15:00.520
I then want to turn to the
central philosophical question

00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:05.690
about punishment, which is what
sort of justification

00:15:05.690 --> 00:15:07.600
does punishment have?

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:10.920
And you will discover, as you
noticed already from the

00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:15.300
readings, that two of the
dominant justifications that

00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:20.380
are offered for punishment
actually echo two of the

00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:25.490
dominant justifications
for moral constraint.

00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:30.135
That is, one can give roughly
a utilitarian account of

00:15:30.135 --> 00:15:34.160
punishment, and one can give
roughly a deontological

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:35.720
account of punishment.

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:39.840
And I want to try to get you
within the mindset of each of

00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:43.750
those two conceptions of
punishment, both in order to

00:15:43.750 --> 00:15:47.150
help you think about punishment
in order to help

00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:51.510
you think about, more clearly,
some of the issues in moral

00:15:51.510 --> 00:15:54.870
philosophy that we were talking
about before break.

00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:59.760
And of course, I will not merely
present those views,

00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:03.520
but will try to give you a sense
of why one might think

00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:06.340
those are reasonable or
unreasonable justifications of

00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:07.920
punishment.

00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:12.210
Next class, we're going to turn
to some very interesting

00:16:12.210 --> 00:16:17.270
psychological literature that
does, with respect to the

00:16:17.270 --> 00:16:20.660
deontological and utilitarian
theories of punishment that

00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:23.820
we're looking at philosophically
today, what

00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:26.990
some of the empirical moral
literature did with respect to

00:16:26.990 --> 00:16:30.860
deontology and utilitarianism
more generally.

00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:35.370
That is, it suggests the
psychological substrate for

00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:40.480
our reactions, and in some cases
tries to argue that that

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:44.290
renders those reactions
illegitimate.

00:16:44.290 --> 00:16:47.360
Or illegitimate as a basis
for a certain kind

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:49.830
of normative judgment.

00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:53.480
So again, I want to think about
these both as questions

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:59.113
about punishment, and as ways
of thinking about the

00:16:59.113 --> 00:17:02.520
practical psychological critique
of moral theory more

00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:05.220
generally, that we talked
about last week.

00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:09.650
And finally, what I want to do
next class is to think about

00:17:09.650 --> 00:17:12.380
the relation between punishment
in the civil

00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:17.630
context and punishment in a much
more personal context.

00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:19.710
You might have noticed that one
of the things that we're

00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:23.510
going to be reading for Thursday
is another chapter

00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:28.230
from I take to be the
Aristotelian-inspired

00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:32.090
parenting guide of
Alan Kazdin.

00:17:32.090 --> 00:17:36.585
So let me offer one caveat,
which is the topic of

00:17:36.585 --> 00:17:37.510
punishment is enormous.

00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:39.210
We could offer an
entire lecture

00:17:39.210 --> 00:17:41.530
course on this question.

00:17:41.530 --> 00:17:45.240
And what I'm presenting to you
in the class is a pretty

00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:49.070
bread-and-butter Anglo-American
picture of what

00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:51.080
punishment amounts to.

00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:53.770
Any of you who have thought
about punishment in the

00:17:53.770 --> 00:17:58.780
context of social theory have
encountered some of the

00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:02.670
sophisticated critiques of
punishment that come to the

00:18:02.670 --> 00:18:05.500
Western twentieth-century
philosophical tradition

00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:09.070
largely through the writing
of Nietzsche and Foucault.

00:18:09.070 --> 00:18:13.620
And simply due to time
constraints, not because these

00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:16.270
are uninteresting, indeed
they are extraordinarily

00:18:16.270 --> 00:18:20.040
interesting, we won't be
thinking about these writers

00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:21.780
in this class.

00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:25.020
Though, as always, I'm very
happy during office hours or

00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:28.140
other times to talk to
you about those.

00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:31.530
So let's start with the first
of these questions.

00:18:31.530 --> 00:18:35.020
What do we mean by
civil punishment?

00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:39.640
So when you clicked on your
clicker and you said that

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:43.710
Unlucky Cell Phone, the man who
talking on his cell phone

00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:46.560
accidentally killed the child,
when you said that Unlucky

00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:52.160
Cell Phone was someone who
merited punishment, presumably

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:56.790
you were thinking of something
with roughly the five

00:18:56.790 --> 00:19:01.620
characteristics that are taken
to be characteristics of

00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:05.570
paradigmatic instances of
punishment, are perhaps even

00:19:05.570 --> 00:19:10.430
as necessary and sufficient
conditions for what it is for

00:19:10.430 --> 00:19:13.242
something to be punishment.

00:19:13.242 --> 00:19:16.740
So the first thing, the first
characteristic, the one

00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:19.784
perhaps most salient when we
think about punishment, is

00:19:19.784 --> 00:19:23.040
that punishment is something
that involves a certain kind

00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:26.830
of unpleasantness
or suffering.

00:19:26.830 --> 00:19:31.480
In traditional culture,
punishment involved either the

00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:35.700
infliction of some sort of
physical pain, or the

00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:40.440
infliction of some sort of
social isolation, or the

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:44.240
infliction of some sort
of public humiliation.

00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:49.640
All of these involved
unpleasantness and suffering.

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:53.730
In the amazing description of
the three horses from Plato's

00:19:53.730 --> 00:19:58.360
Phaedrus that we read at the
beginning of the semester, the

00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:04.160
charioteer, in his effort to
direct the recalcitrant wild

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:10.230
horse, pulls on the bit in a way
that brings blood to the

00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:16.030
mouth of the horse in an effort
to inflict punishment.

00:20:16.030 --> 00:20:20.480
So the core notion is that
punishment involves

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:23.800
unpleasantness and suffering.

00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:29.050
It involves bringing somebody
into a state that brings

00:20:29.050 --> 00:20:31.980
disutility to them.

00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:36.650
As far as the felicific calculus
goes, the calculus of

00:20:36.650 --> 00:20:40.510
felicity, the enumeration of the
amount of happiness in the

00:20:40.510 --> 00:20:46.220
world, punishment reduces in
that individual the amount of

00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:49.536
happiness that they have.

00:20:49.536 --> 00:20:51.636
Second characteristic.

00:20:51.636 --> 00:20:55.440
Punishment is not merely the
infliction of pain or

00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:57.190
suffering on an individual.

00:20:57.190 --> 00:21:01.000
It's the infliction of pain or
suffering on an individual in

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:04.470
response to a particular
offense.

00:21:04.470 --> 00:21:08.210
Either a legal offense, in the
case of legal punishment.

00:21:08.210 --> 00:21:11.120
Or if you think that punishment
is also something

00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:15.720
that can be carried out with
regard to moral trespasses, in

00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:18.006
response to a moral offense.

00:21:18.006 --> 00:21:20.960
So it's not just a bringing
about of pain

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:22.270
randomly in the world.

00:21:22.270 --> 00:21:25.410
It's a bringing about of pain in
the world in response to a

00:21:25.410 --> 00:21:27.130
legal offense.

00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:32.440
To the person who committed
the offense.

00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:36.520
So, it's not merely that if
something bad happens in a

00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:41.560
location: you find an
individual and visit

00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:43.810
suffering upon them.

00:21:43.810 --> 00:21:49.320
The individual on whom suffering
is visited is

00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:54.960
supposed to be the one who has
been judged, by whatever

00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:57.730
procedures are considered the
legitimate procedures for

00:21:57.730 --> 00:22:02.940
making such judgments, to
have been an offender.

00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:05.980
Moreover, the punishment needs
to be intentionally

00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:09.510
administered by a human agent.

00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:14.600
It's not enough if natural
forces somehow bring about the

00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:15.870
bad consequences.

00:22:15.870 --> 00:22:20.290
And we'll talk about that, with
respect to a puzzle, in

00:22:20.290 --> 00:22:24.430
the case of retributive
punishment, in a moment.

00:22:24.430 --> 00:22:29.600
And finally, it's imposed and
administered not by an

00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:34.640
individual acting on his or her
own, or even by a posse of

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:38.710
individuals, who have taken the
law into their hands, but

00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:45.110
rather by a legal authority that
has the sanction of the

00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:50.130
state or civil institution
behind it.

00:22:50.130 --> 00:22:54.960
So the question that punishment
raises, and we'll

00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:58.330
think about this again when we
start thinking about political

00:22:58.330 --> 00:23:04.750
theory more generally, is how is
it that a state could ever

00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:12.040
be justified in bringing harm
to one of its members.

00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:19.650
How could it be legitimate for
a society to cause one of its

00:23:19.650 --> 00:23:26.520
individuals to experience
unpleasantness or suffering?

00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:32.730
So there are two basic kinds
of justification that are

00:23:32.730 --> 00:23:36.708
offered for punishment.

00:23:36.708 --> 00:23:41.820
The first is a forward-looking
justification.

00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:49.520
It's one that says punishment is
an effective mechanism for

00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:53.060
avoiding future harm.

00:23:53.060 --> 00:23:58.600
When somebody acts in a way that
violates either legal or

00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:04.750
social norm, that individual
indicates, perhaps, a

00:24:04.750 --> 00:24:09.100
likelihood of acting
in that way again.

00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:13.870
And so disabling them
is important.

00:24:13.870 --> 00:24:18.070
Or, when an individual acts in
a way that violates legal or

00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:23.041
social norms, and others see
that the individual has acted

00:24:23.041 --> 00:24:27.150
in that way, and received no
negative consequences from the

00:24:27.150 --> 00:24:30.300
community as a result,
others will be likely

00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:31.810
to act in that way.

00:24:31.810 --> 00:24:37.770
And so punishment serves a
public deterrent function.

00:24:37.770 --> 00:24:40.520
Regardless of how it's
operationalized, and we'll

00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:44.165
talk a bit more about that at
the end of the lecture, the

00:24:44.165 --> 00:24:47.630
basic motivation for the
forward-looking justification

00:24:47.630 --> 00:24:51.280
of punishment is that punishment
is an effective

00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:54.560
means of avoiding future harm.

00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:58.460
So that in some way, the
suffering of the individual

00:24:58.460 --> 00:25:04.520
who is punished on behalf of
the state is offset by the

00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:10.240
benefits to other individuals
that will result as a

00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:13.490
consequence of having caused
suffering in one place.

00:25:13.490 --> 00:25:18.496
It's a trade-off of disutility
and utility.

00:25:18.496 --> 00:25:23.260
The second sort of justification
of punishment,

00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:28.280
and let me say, those of you who
felt unsatisfied by number

00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:34.630
one but frustrated by Kant in
our moral theory discussion

00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:38.560
before March break, have some
thinking to do about how your

00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:40.576
worldviews fit together.

00:25:40.576 --> 00:25:46.040
The second justification of
punishment is that punishment

00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:52.170
is called for, because when
somebody violates moral or

00:25:52.170 --> 00:25:59.400
legal codes, they deserve
to be penalized.

00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:03.970
The justification is not that
it's a way of avoiding future

00:26:03.970 --> 00:26:07.800
harm, though it might happen to
bring that, as a nice added

00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:08.810
of benefit.

00:26:08.810 --> 00:26:13.460
The reason an individual is to
be punished on this picture is

00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:18.500
because in committing a moral or
legal violation, the person

00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:22.300
has violated the moral or legal
code in such a way that

00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:29.290
what he or she deserves
is to be punished.

00:26:29.290 --> 00:26:31.680
So those are the two
justifications that we're

00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:33.700
going to think about.

00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:37.090
But I want to point out that
there's another way of

00:26:37.090 --> 00:26:41.370
thinking about punishment that
we'll talk about a little bit

00:26:41.370 --> 00:26:46.470
more in the context of the
lecture, which is, you might

00:26:46.470 --> 00:26:52.390
think about punishment as
being a response to a

00:26:52.390 --> 00:26:57.860
disruption of the social order,
in such a way that at

00:26:57.860 --> 00:26:59.900
least two individuals
are involved.

00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:05.096
One, the victim, with respect
to whom, if you want to

00:27:05.096 --> 00:27:09.230
restore the pre-harm state, the
important thing to think

00:27:09.230 --> 00:27:12.700
about in the context of
punishment is neither the

00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:15.480
large question about retribution
nor the large

00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:18.510
question about deterrence,
though those are important to

00:27:18.510 --> 00:27:21.710
the individual as a member of
society, but rather in the

00:27:21.710 --> 00:27:25.850
case of this specific crime,
what one wants to think about

00:27:25.850 --> 00:27:26.860
is restitution.

00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:30.660
What can be done to restore
the individual to

00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:33.342
her pre-harm state?

00:27:33.342 --> 00:27:38.780
And, in the case of the
offender, one might think

00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:43.620
about what can be done to
restore that individual to

00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:47.740
what one might think of as a
larger, more global pre-harm

00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:55.370
state, namely towards a
situation of pro-sociality.

00:27:55.370 --> 00:27:57.900
So let's illustrate these
four ideas with

00:27:57.900 --> 00:27:59.836
a particular example.

00:27:59.836 --> 00:28:04.794
Here's our old friend Gyges,
remember him, back in January?

00:28:04.794 --> 00:28:08.405
There he was, and for now,
we've given him a horse.

00:28:08.405 --> 00:28:14.730
So Gyges has a horse, and up
shows Pedro, he's our bad guy

00:28:14.730 --> 00:28:18.264
from Jim and the Indians,
and Pedro goes and

00:28:18.264 --> 00:28:23.530
steals Gyges' horse.

00:28:23.530 --> 00:28:28.600
Now, what is to be done?

00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:33.470
Well, if the question that
interests us is that of

00:28:33.470 --> 00:28:38.010
restoring the situation to its
pre-harm state, then our

00:28:38.010 --> 00:28:41.750
primary concern is
with restitution.

00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:46.840
We want Pedro to give Gyges
back his horse.

00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:51.140
Suppose that instead of stealing
Gyges' horse, Pedro

00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:55.476
had murdered Gyges' horse?

00:28:55.476 --> 00:28:59.510
We might think then that what
restitution requires is

00:28:59.510 --> 00:29:02.515
presenting Pedro with something
as good as the horse

00:29:02.515 --> 00:29:03.600
he previously had.

00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:08.370
Perhaps Pedro needs to give dot
Gyges one of his horses.

00:29:08.370 --> 00:29:12.470
But the picture that lies behind
restitution, and we'll

00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:15.990
talk about the ways in which
restitution is problematic,

00:29:15.990 --> 00:29:20.020
when restoring to the pre-harm
state involves something a

00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:24.390
little more complicated than
giving back stolen property or

00:29:24.390 --> 00:29:26.540
replacing in kind.

00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:31.490
The notion behind restitution is
that the goal in which the

00:29:31.490 --> 00:29:36.560
state has legitimate reason to
be engaged, is that of taking

00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:41.180
the innocent party and making
sure that they are no worse

00:29:41.180 --> 00:29:45.110
off after having suffered
a crime than

00:29:45.110 --> 00:29:48.250
before having suffered.

00:29:48.250 --> 00:29:52.790
What does the notion of
rehabilitation tell us to do

00:29:52.790 --> 00:29:54.070
in this state?

00:29:54.070 --> 00:29:58.680
Well, presumably it tells us to
think about how-- there's

00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:01.390
Pedro with a shepherd's
staff--

00:30:01.390 --> 00:30:07.080
how can we help make somebody,
whose interactions with

00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:12.870
society involve violations of
its norms, such that he or she

00:30:12.870 --> 00:30:17.640
comes to internalize those
norms in a way that they

00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:22.570
become the grounding for
his or her behavior?

00:30:22.570 --> 00:30:29.620
In some ways, rehabilitation is
the most effective means of

00:30:29.620 --> 00:30:32.480
deterrence and prevention.

00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:36.890
If it's possible to reinstate
pro-sociality in parts of the

00:30:36.890 --> 00:30:40.860
individuals towards whom we are
expressing concern through

00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:47.220
punishment, wouldn't that be
the most effective means?

00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:50.750
So that's one version
of thinking about

00:30:50.750 --> 00:30:51.650
what's going on.

00:30:51.650 --> 00:30:56.560
We might think about restitution
for the harmed and

00:30:56.560 --> 00:30:59.840
rehabilitation for the harmer.

00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:03.070
Alternatively, we might think
about the question in terms of

00:31:03.070 --> 00:31:05.310
the two categories that we're
going to focus on for the

00:31:05.310 --> 00:31:06.900
remainder of lecture.

00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:12.640
That is, we might lock up
Pedro and do so with the

00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:15.390
justification that that
will prevent him from

00:31:15.390 --> 00:31:17.622
doing future crime.

00:31:17.622 --> 00:31:22.710
Or we might lock up Pedro with
the thought-- watch the slide,

00:31:22.710 --> 00:31:26.630
it's the only joke all lecture--
that in so doing,

00:31:26.630 --> 00:31:31.020
what we provide is justice.

00:31:31.020 --> 00:31:34.930
There's one more visual joke
later in lecture about the

00:31:34.930 --> 00:31:39.660
ways in which it is part of
our pop culture, part of

00:31:39.660 --> 00:31:43.460
cartoons, part of comic books,
part of movies, that somehow

00:31:43.460 --> 00:31:48.700
the visiting of justice upon
an offender is absolutely

00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:52.370
critical to society's
well-being.

00:31:52.370 --> 00:31:56.360
So what I want to do is
introduce you now, from the

00:31:56.360 --> 00:32:00.600
inside, from the work of Kant,
on the one hand, and then more

00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:02.590
generally, and then through
the work of Rawls on the

00:32:02.590 --> 00:32:05.690
other, to these two sorts
of justifications.

00:32:05.690 --> 00:32:08.570
So let's start with the
retributivist outlook.

00:32:08.570 --> 00:32:12.480
That's the outlook, roughly,
that when somebody does

00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:16.300
something that violates legal
or moral norms, they've

00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:20.620
committed a wrong, and in so
doing they've put the scales

00:32:20.620 --> 00:32:25.080
of justice somehow
out of line.

00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:31.720
And that what punishment does is
it reorients the scales of

00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:33.830
justice, it re-balances
things.

00:32:36.660 --> 00:32:42.140
In punishing the harm-doer, we
reorient the world in such a

00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:49.900
way that injustice becomes
re-weighted, that desert is

00:32:49.900 --> 00:32:53.540
visited upon the harm-doer.

00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:57.130
So the text we read in
discussing the retributivist

00:32:57.130 --> 00:33:00.440
outlook was that of
Immanuel Kant.

00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:05.000
And Kant writes explicitly
"juridical punishment can

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:09.130
never be administered merely
as a means for promoting

00:33:09.130 --> 00:33:13.470
another good, either with regard
to the criminal himself

00:33:13.470 --> 00:33:18.840
or the civil society." That is,
deterrence, prevention of

00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:23.490
future harm, rehabilitation,
all of --

00:33:23.490 --> 00:33:25.640
those are other goods--

00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:30.710
may well come along in the
wake of punishment.

00:33:30.710 --> 00:33:35.910
But that cannot be the
justification for the action.

00:33:35.910 --> 00:33:40.200
"Judicial punishment," says
Kant, "can be imposed only

00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:45.020
because the individual on whom
it is inflicted has committed

00:33:45.020 --> 00:33:50.320
a crime." This is of
a piece with Kant's

00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:52.660
more general outlook.

00:33:52.660 --> 00:33:59.510
You recall from the opening
pages of the Groundwork that

00:33:59.510 --> 00:34:05.260
Kant isn't interested in
thinking about consequences.

00:34:05.260 --> 00:34:11.699
Kant is interested in thinking
about moral rightness, and the

00:34:11.699 --> 00:34:17.679
way in which our behaviors and
our social institutions can

00:34:17.679 --> 00:34:21.170
reflect our recognition
of this fundamental

00:34:21.170 --> 00:34:23.219
fact about the world.

00:34:23.219 --> 00:34:27.739
So those of you who are drawn to
the picture that criminals

00:34:27.739 --> 00:34:33.139
deserve their deserts, not for
utilitarian reasons but for

00:34:33.139 --> 00:34:36.650
fundamental ones, need to
think about whether that

00:34:36.650 --> 00:34:41.469
brings in its wake for you a
commitment to something like

00:34:41.469 --> 00:34:45.080
the more general Kantian
outlook, whereby a good will

00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:50.800
is good not because of what it
affects or accomplishes, but

00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:55.110
rather good in itself.

00:34:55.110 --> 00:34:59.302
That's the core of the
retributivist outlook.

00:34:59.302 --> 00:35:02.820
The retributivist outlook
often brings with it--

00:35:02.820 --> 00:35:05.420
in addition to an answer to
the question, what's the

00:35:05.420 --> 00:35:07.750
justification for punishment?

00:35:07.750 --> 00:35:12.790
Answer, moral desert--an account
of what Kant, in the

00:35:12.790 --> 00:35:15.800
writings that we read for today,
calls the "principle

00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:19.290
and standards of public
justice." That is,

00:35:19.290 --> 00:35:23.830
retributivism includes not
merely the idea that criminals

00:35:23.830 --> 00:35:30.060
deserve penalty, but also a
picture of what grounds that

00:35:30.060 --> 00:35:33.950
penalty, and sometimes a
characterization of what those

00:35:33.950 --> 00:35:36.140
specific penalties amount to.

00:35:36.140 --> 00:35:41.060
So Kant writes, "the undeserved
evil which anyone

00:35:41.060 --> 00:35:47.610
commits to another is to be one
regarded as perpetrated on

00:35:47.610 --> 00:35:54.340
himself." That is, a principled
justification for

00:35:54.340 --> 00:35:59.820
punishment in kind to the harm
one has committed underlies

00:35:59.820 --> 00:36:00.790
Kant's picture.

00:36:00.790 --> 00:36:05.140
So, he continues, "whoever
steals makes

00:36:05.140 --> 00:36:07.910
all property insecure.

00:36:07.910 --> 00:36:12.400
He therefore robs himself
of security in property,

00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:16.910
according to the right of
retaliation." The punishment

00:36:16.910 --> 00:36:24.170
for theft is loss of property,
says Kant, on the principle

00:36:24.170 --> 00:36:27.710
that the undeserved evil which
anyone commits on another is

00:36:27.710 --> 00:36:31.320
to be regarded as perpetrated
on himself.

00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:35.480
The logic of that argument, of
course, brings with it the

00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:40.440
conclusion that Pojman helpfully
italicizes in Kant

00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:47.350
for us, "whoever has committed
murder must die." I'm not sure

00:36:47.350 --> 00:36:50.050
the italics are in the original
German, but they do

00:36:50.050 --> 00:36:52.680
serve to make the text
effective, for those of you

00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:55.840
coming back from March break and
looking for a wake-up call

00:36:55.840 --> 00:36:57.800
in doing your reading.

00:36:57.800 --> 00:37:02.720
So the picture that retaliation
of the sort that

00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:07.960
is demanded by moral desert,
that retribution for harm

00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:11.190
brings with it the mandate
that a similar harm be

00:37:11.190 --> 00:37:15.910
perpetrated on you has, in
Kant's articulation, a

00:37:15.910 --> 00:37:18.680
particular form.

00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:23.580
The thought that death should
be visited upon one who

00:37:23.580 --> 00:37:30.800
commits a crime of killing has
struck many as a way of

00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:35.050
expressing not retribution,
but revenge.

00:37:35.050 --> 00:37:40.490
And I want to present you with a
very nice analysis, that was

00:37:40.490 --> 00:37:44.360
adverted to in one of your
readings, that Robert Nozick,

00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:46.930
whom we'll be reading
more from later and

00:37:46.930 --> 00:37:48.590
read some from before.

00:37:48.590 --> 00:37:53.100
A nice analysis that he offers
of the difference between

00:37:53.100 --> 00:37:56.050
retribution, on the one hand,
and revenge, on the other.

00:37:56.050 --> 00:37:58.900
Because I want to try to give
you a really clean picture of

00:37:58.900 --> 00:38:02.490
what the retributionist
picture amounts to.

00:38:02.490 --> 00:38:05.790
So one axis along which you
might contrast retribution and

00:38:05.790 --> 00:38:09.080
revenge is what it is that
triggers a desire for

00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:09.870
retribution.

00:38:09.870 --> 00:38:14.720
And Nozick says retribution is
triggered by a legal or moral

00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:20.230
wrong, a violation of a code
that is accepted by all

00:38:20.230 --> 00:38:23.380
parties, though it may have been
violated by one of them,

00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:28.330
whereas revenge might occur
in response to a harm or a

00:38:28.330 --> 00:38:33.920
slight, not a violation of
the moral code, as such.

00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:37.020
There are, says Nozick,
limits to retribution.

00:38:37.020 --> 00:38:40.030
Kant has just articulated
one version of that.

00:38:40.030 --> 00:38:43.500
We penalize exactly in
proportion to the harm done,

00:38:43.500 --> 00:38:45.030
on Kant's picture.

00:38:45.030 --> 00:38:50.500
By contract, revenge is, in
principle, unlimited.

00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:54.250
In terms of the personality
involved, the degree of

00:38:54.250 --> 00:38:58.630
personalization, retribution
is impersonal, it's carried

00:38:58.630 --> 00:39:00.140
out by the state.

00:39:00.140 --> 00:39:02.480
Remember, that was one of our
characterizations, one of the

00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:03.770
elements of our characterization
of

00:39:03.770 --> 00:39:04.790
punishment.

00:39:04.790 --> 00:39:07.290
Whereas revenge is personal.

00:39:07.290 --> 00:39:11.960
It's carried out by an
individual for the sake of

00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:15.760
expressing that individual's
dissatisfaction.

00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:19.510
Retribution differs from revenge
in emotional tone.

00:39:19.510 --> 00:39:22.800
When one engages in retribution,
one either takes

00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:29.090
pleasure in justice itself, or
has no emotional feeling.

00:39:29.090 --> 00:39:32.460
When you put a criminal in
jail, the pleasure is in

00:39:32.460 --> 00:39:37.970
having done the right thing, as
far as justice demands, not

00:39:37.970 --> 00:39:43.500
the pleasure in seeing the
suffering of another.

00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:47.460
There's a kind of generality
that attaches to retribution.

00:39:47.460 --> 00:39:50.850
An individual who performs a
particular kind of act in a

00:39:50.850 --> 00:39:52.940
particular kind of circumstance,
whoever they

00:39:52.940 --> 00:39:56.530
are, is going to be worthy
of retribution.

00:39:56.530 --> 00:39:59.920
Whereas in the case of revenge,
it's about a specific

00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:03.290
person at a specific time, not
as an instance of a category,

00:40:03.290 --> 00:40:07.500
but as a particular wrongdoer
in eyes of

00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:09.540
the one taking vengeance.

00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:13.420
There is a way in which
retribution and revenge are

00:40:13.420 --> 00:40:19.066
similar, and that is that both
of them are expressive acts.

00:40:19.066 --> 00:40:23.910
In the case of both of them, the
target is supposed to know

00:40:23.910 --> 00:40:28.420
why the penalty is being
inflicted, and to know that he

00:40:28.420 --> 00:40:32.050
is intended to know that.

00:40:32.050 --> 00:40:35.250
So again, these slides will be
up, if you didn't get down all

00:40:35.250 --> 00:40:35.815
the details.

00:40:35.815 --> 00:40:39.660
But the picture of retribution
that we're interested in is

00:40:39.660 --> 00:40:42.450
the one on the left.

00:40:42.450 --> 00:40:46.360
So, I want to talk about two
cases where this knowledge

00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:52.510
condition gives rise to
potentially amusing or

00:40:52.510 --> 00:40:54.310
perplexing situations.

00:40:54.310 --> 00:40:57.420
One, in the case of revenge, and
the other in the case of

00:40:57.420 --> 00:40:58.260
retribution.

00:40:58.260 --> 00:41:04.280
So it is, as you know, a trope
in comic books that the

00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:08.680
villain is always trying to kill
the hero in such a way

00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:12.290
that the hero knows why the
villain is trying to do that.

00:41:12.290 --> 00:41:15.770
And those of you familiar with
Austin Powers know that Austin

00:41:15.770 --> 00:41:19.780
Powers is always able to escape
Dr. Evil, because Dr.

00:41:19.780 --> 00:41:22.660
Evil is so concerned with what
we might think about the

00:41:22.660 --> 00:41:28.690
publicity constraint or the
expressive role of revenge.

00:41:28.690 --> 00:41:34.170
But in addition to creating plot
lines in parody movies,

00:41:34.170 --> 00:41:38.670
the phenomenon that retribution
involves a

00:41:38.670 --> 00:41:44.650
particular kind of bringing
about of harm gives rise to a

00:41:44.650 --> 00:41:47.400
perplexing phenomenon, that we
might call "justice as the

00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:49.180
world ends."

00:41:49.180 --> 00:41:52.120
So Nozick writes, "the
conditions demarcating

00:41:52.120 --> 00:41:56.230
retribution explain what
otherwise appears to be a

00:41:56.230 --> 00:41:57.510
ludicrous phenomenon.

00:41:57.510 --> 00:42:02.130
If someone sentenced to death
falls perilously ill or

00:42:02.130 --> 00:42:07.610
attempts suicide, execution is
postponed and measures are

00:42:07.610 --> 00:42:11.840
taken to bring the condemned
person back to health, so that

00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:13.050
he can then be executed.

00:42:13.050 --> 00:42:18.680
This is because his punishment
is to involve something being

00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:23.180
visited upon him by others
because of the

00:42:23.180 --> 00:42:25.600
wrongness of his act.

00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:29.950
His death by natural causes or
by his own hand would avoid

00:42:29.950 --> 00:42:35.530
this so measures are taken to
restore him for punishment."

00:42:35.530 --> 00:42:41.670
Notice the way in which this
parallels the discussion of

00:42:41.670 --> 00:42:46.280
the drowning child case in the
work of Mill's Utilitarianism,

00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:51.170
on the one hand, Kant's
Groundwork, on the other.

00:42:51.170 --> 00:42:57.640
Mill is just interested in the
child getting out of the pond,

00:42:57.640 --> 00:43:02.310
and isn't, in that passage,
interested in whether you do

00:43:02.310 --> 00:43:05.120
it because you're showing off
for somebody that you want to

00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:08.140
impress on the shoreline, or
trying to get a financial

00:43:08.140 --> 00:43:11.300
reward, or expressing a
certain kind of moral

00:43:11.300 --> 00:43:12.780
commitment.

00:43:12.780 --> 00:43:19.100
Kant is interested in why
you are doing it.

00:43:19.100 --> 00:43:21.360
So too here.

00:43:21.360 --> 00:43:27.360
The retributivist picture says
what matters is not that the

00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:32.860
criminal end up dead, at the
end of things, in some way.

00:43:32.860 --> 00:43:35.870
What matter is that the criminal
end up dead or

00:43:35.870 --> 00:43:38.010
punished in the right kind of
way, at the end of things,

00:43:38.010 --> 00:43:42.150
because of a particular
process.

00:43:42.150 --> 00:43:44.750
So we'll close today's lecture
and continue with

00:43:44.750 --> 00:43:49.870
utilitarianism next class with
the otherwise perplexing quote

00:43:49.870 --> 00:43:52.830
from the end of Kant, which you
are now in a position to

00:43:52.830 --> 00:43:54.346
understand.

00:43:54.346 --> 00:43:58.300
Kant writes, if it's 2012, and
the world is ending, in the

00:43:58.300 --> 00:44:00.860
way that it does in that movie,
and the waves are

00:44:00.860 --> 00:44:03.850
coming in and the lightning is
striking, and the new Ice Age

00:44:03.850 --> 00:44:06.960
is emerging, the first thing
you have to do before the

00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:08.950
world ends, says Kant,
is execute

00:44:08.950 --> 00:44:11.100
everybody on death row.

00:44:11.100 --> 00:44:14.960
"Even if civil society resolves
to dissolve itself,

00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:18.860
the last murderer lying in
prison," says Kant, "ought to

00:44:18.860 --> 00:44:20.670
be executed before it does.

00:44:20.670 --> 00:44:24.590
This ought to be done."--this is
the retributivist picture--

00:44:24.590 --> 00:44:29.630
"that everyone may realize
the desert of his deeds."

00:44:29.630 --> 00:44:32.870
We'll pick up again on Thursday,
with the utilitarian

00:44:32.870 --> 00:44:34.640
justification for punishment.

00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:37.090
And I'll see you then.

00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:02.630
Prof: It's kind of a
complicated lecture today.

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:07.459
I want to talk about
nationalism and I do so with a

00:00:07.459 --> 00:00:11.710
skepticism that you'll quickly
pick up on.

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:16.829
Aggressive nationalism helped
unleash the demons of the

00:00:16.829 --> 00:00:20.310
twentieth century,
beginning with World War I,

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.210
which unleashed even more
dangerous demons after that.

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.438
I want to talk about
nationalism and particularly

00:00:28.438 --> 00:00:33.460
in--a little bit of France,
but in places that one doesn't

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.310
usually consider.
 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.679
I'll end up drawing on my
friend Tim Snyder's work to talk

00:00:38.679 --> 00:00:41.280
a little bit about Lithuania and
Belarus,

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.950
and why their nationalism were
very different and,

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:49.064
in the second case,
didn't really exist at all in

00:00:49.064 --> 00:00:50.500
the nineteenth century.
 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.026
And I'm going to give a counter
example, which I treat in the

00:00:55.026 --> 00:00:58.270
book but is the
Austria-Hungarian Empire.

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:03.435
It's funny, because one
couldn't have imagined in the

00:01:03.435 --> 00:01:05.841
1970s,
looking nostalgically back on

00:01:05.841 --> 00:01:11.718
the Austria-Hungarian Empire,
this polyglot Habsburg regime.

00:01:11.718 --> 00:01:16.061
But the horrors of the Balkans
really made lots of historians

00:01:16.061 --> 00:01:20.549
and other social scientists look
back and try to figure out how

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.037
it was that--instead of asking
why it was the Austria-Hungarian

00:01:25.037 --> 00:01:28.150
Empire collapsed during World
War I,

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:29.610
or really at the end of World
War I,

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.349
turning the question around and
saying,

00:01:31.349 --> 00:01:32.879
"How did it hold together
so long?"

00:01:32.879 --> 00:01:36.513
So, the Austria-Hungarian
Empire is sort of a counter

00:01:36.513 --> 00:01:38.750
example to these nationalisms.
 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.471
One of the things that brought
the empire down,

00:01:43.471 --> 00:01:48.399
along with the war,
was competing national claims

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:53.840
from ethnic minorities within
those vast domains.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.760
I want to start with a story.
 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:00.828
It's a book I read maybe five
or six years ago.

00:02:00.828 --> 00:02:04.364
Histories have their histories,
so I'm going to tell the

00:02:04.364 --> 00:02:06.549
history of this particular book.
 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:10.180
You'll see kind of what I'm
getting at.

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:12.759
By the way, I sent out--one of
you had a great idea,

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:14.795
emailed me saying,
"Why don't you send out

00:02:14.795 --> 00:02:16.219
the terms before the
lecture?"

00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:17.659
That was a great idea.
 

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:18.639
I'd never thought of that.
 

00:02:18.639 --> 00:02:20.710
I did it last night,
though I didn't put this

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:21.840
particular book on it.
 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.439
Anyway, the book is Anastasia
Karakasidou's, Fields of

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:28.633
Wheat,
Hills of Blood:

00:02:28.633 --> 00:02:32.900
Passages to Nationhood in Greek
Macedonia,

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.095
1870-1990. When I say that
histories have their own

00:02:37.095 --> 00:02:40.840
history,
what I mean is the following.

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.060
In this book,
this anthropologist,

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:49.672
who is from both Turkish and
Greek extraction on either side

00:02:49.672 --> 00:02:54.036
of her family,
is writing a book about a small

00:02:54.036 --> 00:02:55.720
part of Macedonia.
 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.169
Macedonia, of course,
was heavily contested for

00:02:59.169 --> 00:03:00.069
centuries.
 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:05.098
A trade route went through it.
 

00:03:05.098 --> 00:03:08.882
In Macedonia there were Turks,
and there were Serbs,

00:03:08.882 --> 00:03:11.997
and there were Bulgarians,
and Macedonians,

00:03:11.997 --> 00:03:13.110
and Greeks.
 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:19.298
For centuries they had all
basically gotten along as that

00:03:19.298 --> 00:03:22.750
part of the Balkans,
as you know,

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.986
in the past was under the
Ottoman Empire and then through

00:03:27.986 --> 00:03:32.008
a whole series of arrangements,
of wars,

00:03:32.008 --> 00:03:33.629
the Balkan wars before World
War I,

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:35.848
passed back and forth.
 

00:03:35.848 --> 00:03:39.087
Essentially,
that is one of the points of

00:03:39.087 --> 00:03:42.300
the book,
is that basically people got

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:46.008
along very well,
but that gradually what

00:03:46.008 --> 00:03:51.930
happened is that among competing
national claims that part of

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:57.949
Macedonia became seen by Greeks
as part of greater Greece.

00:03:57.949 --> 00:04:01.122
Whenever you hear the term
"greater Greece,"

00:04:01.122 --> 00:04:04.774
or "greater Serbia,"
or "greater Germany,"

00:04:04.774 --> 00:04:06.810
or greater anything,
look out.

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.800
What that means is that in the
imaginary,

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.645
in the view of nationalists,
particularly aggressive

00:04:15.645 --> 00:04:18.658
nationalists,
parts of the territories that

00:04:18.658 --> 00:04:23.598
have large percentages of a
certain ethnic group or even in

00:04:23.598 --> 00:04:28.009
some cases only minorities,
but in other cases majorities,

00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:32.629
should be included,
come what may,

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:39.970
in the greater state of that
particular ethnic group.

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:44.488
If you take the example of
Kosovo, and Kosovo has about

00:04:44.488 --> 00:04:48.672
eighty-five percent of the
population is made up of

00:04:48.672 --> 00:04:50.430
Albanian Muslims.
 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:55.110
Kosovo was part of Serbia.
 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:58.396
When Milosevic was talking
about "greater

00:04:58.396 --> 00:05:01.391
Serbia,"
greater Serbia for him could

00:05:01.391 --> 00:05:05.016
not exist unless Kosovo,
with its eighty-five percent of

00:05:05.016 --> 00:05:07.680
people who weren't Serb,
was included in that.

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.870
Anyway, that's another story.
 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:13.769
What happened with this
particular book is that when

00:05:13.769 --> 00:05:18.841
this book was in manuscript,
arguing that basically the idea

00:05:18.841 --> 00:05:22.850
that Macedonia was Greek was a
construction,

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:27.244
was an invention,
an invented identity by Greek

00:05:27.244 --> 00:05:29.569
nationalists,
the press,

00:05:29.569 --> 00:05:32.262
the university press,
I guess since this is being

00:05:32.262 --> 00:05:34.959
recorded I shouldn't say which
one that was,

00:05:34.959 --> 00:05:38.449
chickened out and decided not
to publish the book.

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:44.098
At one point they got a bomb
threat from Greek nationalists

00:05:44.098 --> 00:05:47.540
saying that,
"If you publish this book,

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:49.569
we will blow up your offices in
Europe."

00:05:49.569 --> 00:05:52.100
So, they chickened out.
 

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:57.896
In an example of just utter,
craven cowardice refused to

00:05:57.896 --> 00:05:59.899
publish the book.
 

00:05:59.899 --> 00:06:01.702
They sent this author,
whom I don't know--I've read

00:06:01.702 --> 00:06:02.100
the book.
 

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:04.021
It's a really terrific
book--and said,

00:06:04.021 --> 00:06:04.750
"Sorry.
 

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:06.560
We're not going to publish your
book.

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:09.769
Too bad, contract or no
contract."

00:06:09.769 --> 00:06:12.995
So, University of Chicago Press
published the book,

00:06:12.995 --> 00:06:17.062
and when the book came out this
particular author received a lot

00:06:17.062 --> 00:06:18.160
of hate mail.
 

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:21.860
She received a picture of
herself with a picture of a

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:25.560
Greek flag stuck through where
her heart would be.

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:27.720
These are fairly serious
threats.

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:31.872
The point of that is not to
jump on Greek nationalists or on

00:06:31.872 --> 00:06:35.125
Serb nationalists,
though certainly the Serb

00:06:35.125 --> 00:06:39.528
ultranationalists have done just
an incredible amount of damage

00:06:39.528 --> 00:06:42.440
in the Balkans over the past
decades,

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:47.098
but merely to underline the
point that national identities

00:06:47.098 --> 00:06:48.569
are constructed.
 

00:06:48.569 --> 00:06:51.920
They're invented.
 

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:54.750
They're, in a way, imaginary.
 

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:57.899
One of the most interesting
sort of historical things you

00:06:57.899 --> 00:07:00.600
could do as an historian is to
try to figure out,

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:02.850
from where do these identities
come?

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:05.110
Language plays a lot of it.
 

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:07.519
Maybe if I have time,
because I've got to do a lot

00:07:07.519 --> 00:07:10.420
today, but this is more of a
conversation than a lecture.

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:12.930
If I have time I might talk a
little bit about language in the

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:13.629
case of France.
 

00:07:13.629 --> 00:07:16.406
But, in doing so,
like most people talking about

00:07:16.406 --> 00:07:18.529
nationalism,
I'm drawing on some of the

00:07:18.529 --> 00:07:22.233
thinking of Benedict Anderson,
and his concept that

00:07:22.233 --> 00:07:27.031
nationalism and the construction
of national self-identity

00:07:27.031 --> 00:07:30.990
represents "imagined
communities."

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:35.660
Basically, if you consider
yourself a member of X

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:39.394
nationality,
you are creating links or you

00:07:39.394 --> 00:07:43.790
are agreeing to links with
people whom you don't know,

00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:45.540
people that live in Portland,
Oregon,

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:47.709
or people that live in
Albuquerque, New Mexico,

00:07:47.709 --> 00:07:49.959
or people that live in New
Jersey,

00:07:49.959 --> 00:07:52.579
even though we are sitting here
in Connecticut.

00:07:52.579 --> 00:08:00.783
One of the useful aspects of
Anderson's account is yet again

00:08:00.783 --> 00:08:09.545
to look back at the construction
of nationalism to see that here

00:08:09.545 --> 00:08:13.300
we have that old story.
 

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:18.990
It's states and large-scale
economic change that are the two

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:23.331
driving forces in the
construction of national

00:08:23.331 --> 00:08:24.778
identities.
 

00:08:24.778 --> 00:08:27.136
I've gone on,
at least in two lectures and

00:08:27.136 --> 00:08:29.952
part of another one talking
about British national

00:08:29.952 --> 00:08:33.860
identity--and I'm certainly not
going to go through that again,

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:38.350
except to say that it was
precociously early,

00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:39.840
the sense of being British.
 

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:43.409
I also argued along the lines
that we can now,

00:08:43.409 --> 00:08:46.921
at least for elites,
say that French national

00:08:46.921 --> 00:08:52.018
identity began to be constructed
in at least by the middle of the

00:08:52.018 --> 00:08:53.769
eighteenth century.
 

00:08:53.769 --> 00:08:58.120
When you think of the real
hotspots,

00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:03.370
the real trouble spots of the
twentieth century,

00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:06.178
when you think of the origins
of World War I,

00:09:06.178 --> 00:09:09.926
which we will be doing and
thinking out loud together over

00:09:09.926 --> 00:09:15.033
the next couple weeks,
we will be considering Eastern

00:09:15.033 --> 00:09:20.059
Europe, Central Europe,
and the Balkans.

00:09:20.059 --> 00:09:23.702
What's important to understand,
and this is a reasonably decent

00:09:23.702 --> 00:09:26.740
transition from the initial
discussion of this

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:32.100
anthropologist's excellent book,
is that in most of those places

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:36.070
there was no sense of national
identity,

00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:39.179
of being Slovene,
of being Czech,

00:09:39.179 --> 00:09:43.190
of being Croat,
of being Bulgarian,

00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:46.970
of being Ukrainian or
Ruthenian--the two are

00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:51.804
essentially the same--until
quite late in the nineteenth

00:09:51.804 --> 00:09:52.860
century.
 

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:58.640
Part of what's going on in
Europe between the 1880s and

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:04.316
1914 is this is an incredible
"advancement,"

00:10:04.316 --> 00:10:11.989
if you want to call it that,
in thinking with the emergence

00:10:11.989 --> 00:10:19.990
of ethnic national identities
competing and demanding their

00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:25.509
own states in that part of the
world.

00:10:25.509 --> 00:10:31.422
When, in late June 1914,
a sixteen-year-old

00:10:31.422 --> 00:10:36.518
heavily-armed guy,
Serb nationalist--I once put my

00:10:36.518 --> 00:10:38.951
feet,
which no longer--my feet still

00:10:38.951 --> 00:10:41.692
exist,
but the steps in Sarajevo no

00:10:41.692 --> 00:10:45.120
longer exist because of all the
bombing,

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:49.460
in the place where Princip shot
Archduke Franz Ferdinand,

00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:53.779
the assassination that led,
because of this sort of

00:10:53.779 --> 00:10:59.639
entangling diplomatic alliances,
to World War I.

00:10:59.639 --> 00:11:05.520
He was someone who practically
could not have existed in the

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:09.110
middle of the nineteenth
century,

00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:14.408
even though among Serb elites
there was a national sense.

00:11:14.408 --> 00:11:20.057
I'm going to give you some
examples taken from Anderson of

00:11:20.057 --> 00:11:26.299
even the publication of the very
first dictionaries in languages

00:11:26.299 --> 00:11:32.640
that now are quite common for us
to identify with ethnic national

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:33.928
states.
 

00:11:33.928 --> 00:11:37.370
In fact, some of these
languages did not even have

00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:41.094
their own written dictionaries
until the middle of the

00:11:41.094 --> 00:11:42.710
nineteenth century.
 

00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:44.379
That's not so long ago.
 

00:11:44.379 --> 00:11:46.889
Nationalism has to be
constructed.

00:11:46.889 --> 00:11:51.330
A sense of self-identity has to
be constructed.

00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:55.879
That's what I want to talk
about.

00:11:55.879 --> 00:11:58.990
Let me say something at the
beginning.

00:11:58.990 --> 00:12:03.187
Because of the French
Revolution and because of the

00:12:03.187 --> 00:12:07.974
development in Europe and in
other places of parliamentary

00:12:07.974 --> 00:12:12.960
regimes and democracies,
it's fairly common to think,

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:16.243
"National
self-consciousness equals a

00:12:16.243 --> 00:12:20.727
desire for national states and
you can't have that with a

00:12:20.727 --> 00:12:22.250
monarchy."
 

00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:24.750
That's not really true at all.
 

00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:26.368
That's influenced,
for example,

00:12:26.368 --> 00:12:28.580
by the experience of the United
States.

00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:31.167
In the United States,
the thirteen colonies,

00:12:31.167 --> 00:12:34.417
English was overwhelmingly the
language of the thirteen

00:12:34.417 --> 00:12:35.200
colonies.
 

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:40.947
They are rebelling in 1776 and
all of that against other

00:12:40.947 --> 00:12:47.009
English-speaking people who
happened to have a monarchy.

00:12:47.009 --> 00:12:51.379
So, "no taxation without
representation"

00:12:51.379 --> 00:12:56.730
really became also a kind of an
anti-monarchist sentiment.

00:12:56.730 --> 00:13:00.880
If you think of the Spanish,
the rebellions in Latin America

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:04.798
against Spain,
there, too, the rebellions,

00:13:04.798 --> 00:13:10.761
though there were millions of
indigenous peoples who did not

00:13:10.761 --> 00:13:14.368
speak Spanish,
but basically it was a

00:13:14.368 --> 00:13:19.089
rebellion of Spanish speakers
against a monarch that was

00:13:19.089 --> 00:13:23.038
Spanish,
speaking in the case of Spain.

00:13:23.038 --> 00:13:26.802
If you think about really
extreme ethnic nationalism at

00:13:26.802 --> 00:13:29.379
the end of the nineteenth
century,

00:13:29.379 --> 00:13:34.251
you think of two states which
helped kind of push the world to

00:13:34.251 --> 00:13:38.803
the catastrophe that was World
War I, one has to point the

00:13:38.803 --> 00:13:41.919
finger at both Russia and
Germany,

00:13:41.919 --> 00:13:43.889
which had autocracies.
 

00:13:45.918 --> 00:13:48.864
This is jumping ahead a little
bit, but I'm providing you an

00:13:48.864 --> 00:13:49.312
overview.
 

00:13:49.312 --> 00:13:51.408
For example,
the campaign--;this is jumping

00:13:51.408 --> 00:13:54.154
ahead a little bit--;the
campaign of Russiafication that

00:13:54.154 --> 00:13:56.350
was undertaken by the Russian
czars,

00:13:56.350 --> 00:14:01.471
a brutal campaign against
non-Russian minorities,

00:14:01.471 --> 00:14:05.202
was, in part,
a response to rebellions within

00:14:05.202 --> 00:14:08.009
the Russian empire by Poles,
for example,

00:14:08.009 --> 00:14:14.428
who rise up in 1831 and in 1863
and are crushed like grapes.

00:14:14.428 --> 00:14:17.755
In 1863, Bismarck,
the chancellor of Germany,

00:14:17.755 --> 00:14:21.384
congratulates the czar for
stomping on the Polish

00:14:21.384 --> 00:14:22.519
insurgents.
 

00:14:22.519 --> 00:14:28.062
But the campaign of
Russiaficiation was part of the

00:14:28.062 --> 00:14:32.940
re-invention of Russian national
identity.

00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:35.711
When I talked about Peter the
Great, I talked about how he saw

00:14:35.711 --> 00:14:37.529
himself as this great Russian
patriot.

00:14:37.529 --> 00:14:42.059
Well, aggressive Russian
nationalism picks its targets

00:14:42.059 --> 00:14:47.190
rather systematically in the
campaigns of Russiaficiation.

00:14:47.190 --> 00:14:50.850
The big pogroms,
the massacres of Jews in

00:14:50.850 --> 00:14:54.418
Odessa, in Crimea,
and in other places,

00:14:54.418 --> 00:14:58.298
are cheered on by the Russian
czar, by Nicholas II,

00:14:58.298 --> 00:15:02.200
whom I will talk about when I
get to the Russian Revolution,

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:04.028
who saw this as a healthy
thing,

00:15:04.028 --> 00:15:07.940
that the Jews are being beaten
to death by real Russians.

00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:13.070
This was part of his campaign
of Russiafication.

00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:18.648
In the case of Germany you've
got this madcap loser,

00:15:18.648 --> 00:15:22.580
Wilhelm II,
cracking bottles of champagne,

00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:24.879
or not of champagne,
but of Riesling, as I said,

00:15:24.879 --> 00:15:29.149
over big speedy battleships and
all of that.

00:15:29.149 --> 00:15:34.173
Nobody was a more aggressive
nationalist than Wilhelm II,

00:15:34.173 --> 00:15:36.410
the Kaiser,
who kept saying rather

00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:38.461
disingenuously that he was
"the number one

00:15:38.461 --> 00:15:39.889
German" and all of that.
 

00:15:39.889 --> 00:15:45.628
We can get rid of the idea that
strong national identity

00:15:45.628 --> 00:15:50.009
necessarily has a parliamentary
outcome.

00:15:50.009 --> 00:15:52.169
In the case of Britain,
we're not going to talk about

00:15:52.169 --> 00:15:53.956
Britain too much,
but the case of Britain is

00:15:53.956 --> 00:15:55.120
pretty interesting,
too.

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:57.960
But there you have a monarch
without real power.

00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:02.913
Victoria represents in the
imaginary of the British

00:16:02.913 --> 00:16:09.057
citizens the stability and the
constitutional settlement of the

00:16:09.057 --> 00:16:10.940
British Empire.
 

00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:14.918
Yet, a couple of points need to
be made.

00:16:14.918 --> 00:16:22.408
Language is important in all of
this, though not always.

00:16:22.408 --> 00:16:25.899
Maybe if I have time I'll give
a Swiss example later on.

00:16:25.899 --> 00:16:31.580
Basically, in the case of
Russian and German nationalism,

00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:35.230
and French nationalism and even
Spanish nationalism,

00:16:35.230 --> 00:16:37.658
because of the dominance of
Castille,

00:16:37.658 --> 00:16:42.100
one looks back to the time when
national languages,

00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:47.686
which already existed,
are used and become identified

00:16:47.686 --> 00:16:51.480
with this self-identity of
national people.

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:53.230
Now, Latin was the language.
 

00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:57.645
Latin was the language of
science, of diplomacy,

00:16:57.645 --> 00:16:59.149
of everything.
 

00:16:59.149 --> 00:17:04.317
Part of what's intriguing and
important about the scientific

00:17:04.317 --> 00:17:09.574
revolution is that vernacular
languages begin to be used as a

00:17:09.574 --> 00:17:13.778
way of communicating scientific
discoveries.

00:17:13.778 --> 00:17:16.361
There's a little bit in that
chapter that you read about

00:17:16.361 --> 00:17:16.690
that.
 

00:17:16.690 --> 00:17:25.098
Certainly, language is closely
tied to national self-identity.

00:17:25.098 --> 00:17:29.775
One of the ways when
nationalism is most aggressive

00:17:29.775 --> 00:17:35.290
and most vulgar is when very
ordinary people who are whipped

00:17:35.290 --> 00:17:38.355
up,
egged on or in some ways urged

00:17:38.355 --> 00:17:43.065
on by elites began identifying
people who don't speak the same

00:17:43.065 --> 00:17:47.618
language is somehow not part of
this imagined community.

00:17:47.618 --> 00:17:52.019
An obvious example would be all
the Hungarians who,

00:17:52.019 --> 00:17:55.992
after the Treaty of Versailles
in 1919 and the subsequent

00:17:55.992 --> 00:17:58.690
treaties named after Paris
suburbs,

00:17:58.690 --> 00:18:05.358
are included in Romania and are
treated as outsiders.

00:18:05.358 --> 00:18:10.253
This is very important even in
the origins of the 1989

00:18:10.253 --> 00:18:16.070
revolution that brought down the
dreadful Ceausescu dictators in

00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:17.180
Romania.
 

00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:19.769
Anyway, the vernacular develops.
 

00:18:19.769 --> 00:18:24.440
If you exclude the cases of
Latin America rebelling against

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:29.029
Spain and the Americans
rebelling against the British,

00:18:29.029 --> 00:18:33.913
development of these languages,
and the use of the languages

00:18:33.913 --> 00:18:38.724
and their identity with this
imagined community is obviously

00:18:38.724 --> 00:18:42.068
a very important part of this as
well.

00:18:42.068 --> 00:18:45.680
With the development is the
concept of being a citizen.

00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:49.640
This is one of the many reasons
the French Revolution is so

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:50.460
important.
 

00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:53.828
You were no longer the subject
of the king, you were a

00:18:53.828 --> 00:18:56.355
citoyen, or if you're a
female you're a

00:18:56.355 --> 00:18:57.618
citoyenne.
 

00:18:57.618 --> 00:19:03.788
Citizenship takes on this kind
of linguistic aspect as well.

00:19:03.788 --> 00:19:06.436
During the French Revolution,
there was a revolutionary

00:19:06.436 --> 00:19:08.788
priest called the Abbé
Grégoire.

00:19:08.788 --> 00:19:10.470
I think I mention him in the
book.

00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:14.670
He thought that all of these
regional languages should be

00:19:14.670 --> 00:19:19.230
squished like grapes,
because somehow they stood in

00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:23.420
the way of a true French
national identity.

00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:27.990
Language is so terribly
complicated.

00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:32.280
In the case of Italy,
which is in some ways a counter

00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:36.160
example, I think I said before
but it's true.

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:38.180
At the time of the Italian
unification,

00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:41.490
only about four or five percent
of the population of Italy,

00:19:41.490 --> 00:19:45.348
of the whole boot and Sicily,
spoke what is now considered to

00:19:45.348 --> 00:19:46.069
be Italian.
 

00:19:46.069 --> 00:19:49.140
The case of France,
which I know more about,

00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:52.135
is equally fascinating because
of the time of the French

00:19:52.135 --> 00:19:55.460
Revolution half the French
population did not speak French.

00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:58.549
There was a lot of
bilingualism,

00:19:58.549 --> 00:20:01.740
but they did not speak French.
 

00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:04.384
If you imagine a map of France,
and I think I went through this

00:20:04.384 --> 00:20:06.196
very quickly before,
but if you imagine a map of

00:20:06.196 --> 00:20:07.769
France and if you start at the
top,

00:20:07.769 --> 00:20:15.278
they spoke Dutch in Dunkirk and
places like that.

00:20:15.278 --> 00:20:18.864
If you move over to Alsace and
much of Lorraine,

00:20:18.864 --> 00:20:21.608
they spoke a German dialect
there.

00:20:21.608 --> 00:20:24.760
That would be a majority
language until well after World

00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:25.220
War I.
 

00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:29.970
How the French tried to get rid
of the German is another story,

00:20:29.970 --> 00:20:32.538
a sort of national aggression,
even in the context of

00:20:32.538 --> 00:20:34.420
Germany's defeat after World War
I.

00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:37.368
If you move further south,
as you go to Savoy,

00:20:37.368 --> 00:20:40.843
don't write this down,
but Savoy was annexed to France

00:20:40.843 --> 00:20:41.630
in 1860.
 

00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:45.577
People spoke essentially
Piedmontese, which is the

00:20:45.577 --> 00:20:50.251
language spoken in northern
Italy in the strongest state of

00:20:50.251 --> 00:20:52.588
Italy, Piedmont Sardinia.
 

00:20:52.588 --> 00:20:54.829
Then you go further down and
they spoke what?

00:20:54.829 --> 00:20:56.338
They spoke Provencal.
 

00:20:56.338 --> 00:20:59.509
Provencal, as in Jean de
Florette,

00:20:59.509 --> 00:21:04.313
and Manon des Sources and these
Provencal poets setting up at a

00:21:04.313 --> 00:21:08.419
place called Les Baux and
freezing in the winds of the

00:21:08.419 --> 00:21:12.990
mistral and reading each other
Provençal poetry.

00:21:12.990 --> 00:21:17.012
Then you go to Languedoc and
they spoke Occitan,

00:21:17.012 --> 00:21:19.410
which is a language of Oc.
 

00:21:19.410 --> 00:21:21.309
It's a southern French language.
 

00:21:21.309 --> 00:21:23.640
It's a written language.
 

00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:26.490
You go to Catalonia and they
spoke Catalan.

00:21:26.490 --> 00:21:27.390
No surprise there.
 

00:21:27.390 --> 00:21:31.192
You go into the Basque country
and they spoke Basque,

00:21:31.192 --> 00:21:35.358
which is only remotely
connected to Finnish and Magyar.

00:21:35.358 --> 00:21:38.068
Those are the three hardest
languages in Europe.

00:21:38.068 --> 00:21:40.000
How they got there is another
whole story.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.259
We don't really know.
 

00:21:41.259 --> 00:21:43.618
If you go north,
they spoke Gascon.

00:21:43.618 --> 00:21:45.801
If you go into Brittany,
they spoke Breton,

00:21:45.801 --> 00:21:48.140
which has nothing to do with
French at all.

00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:55.118
Even in places that didn't have
languages there were patois.

00:21:55.118 --> 00:21:57.519
Patois is a sort of a
denigrating term.

00:21:57.519 --> 00:21:58.910
"Well, they speak
patois."

00:21:58.910 --> 00:22:00.618
In other words,
they don't speak really French.

00:22:00.618 --> 00:22:03.848
In central France they spoke
one patois.

00:22:03.848 --> 00:22:06.258
In the Limousin they spoke
another patois that was related

00:22:06.258 --> 00:22:06.848
to that one.
 

00:22:06.848 --> 00:22:09.818
Even in the Loire Valley people
spoke patois.

00:22:09.818 --> 00:22:13.380
This did not condemn them to
eternal backwardness.

00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:17.538
One might say that in the
construction of French national

00:22:17.538 --> 00:22:20.448
identity,
there was an argument a long

00:22:20.448 --> 00:22:24.990
time ago by my late friend Eugen
Weber that said that all French

00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:28.955
national identity had to be
constructed between 1880 and

00:22:28.955 --> 00:22:31.490
1910,
because of railroads,

00:22:31.490 --> 00:22:34.960
military conscription,
and education.

00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:36.885
Railroads, military
conscription,

00:22:36.885 --> 00:22:37.848
and education.
 

00:22:37.848 --> 00:22:39.608
It's easy to see how that would
work.

00:22:39.608 --> 00:22:44.164
In fact, he missed one of the
complexities of this glorious

00:22:44.164 --> 00:22:47.019
country,
which is that lots of Breton

00:22:47.019 --> 00:22:51.500
soldiers didn't learn French
until they were in the trenches,

00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:53.940
if they were lucky enough to
survive in World War I,

00:22:53.940 --> 00:23:00.808
and they still spoke Breton in
the 1920s and 1930s.

00:23:00.808 --> 00:23:05.089
There are still old ladies in
Brittany that still speak Breton

00:23:05.089 --> 00:23:08.670
and their command of French is a
bit problematic.

00:23:08.670 --> 00:23:11.348
In Corsica they still have many
people who speak Corsican.

00:23:11.348 --> 00:23:13.230
They may or may not feel like
they're French.

00:23:13.230 --> 00:23:17.848
Bilingualism,
just as a little aside,

00:23:17.848 --> 00:23:21.548
in the village where I've spent
half my life almost,

00:23:21.548 --> 00:23:23.950
in the last twenty-five years
or so,

00:23:23.950 --> 00:23:29.470
people spoke patois and not
French through the 1930s.

00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:32.250
That really sort of disappeared.
 

00:23:32.250 --> 00:23:34.979
Now older friends of ours
understand patois,

00:23:34.979 --> 00:23:36.630
but they don't speak it.
 

00:23:36.630 --> 00:23:41.463
I had something from a book
that I needed someone to look at

00:23:41.463 --> 00:23:46.298
to make sure that what I'd
written in patois was correct.

00:23:46.298 --> 00:23:48.400
Not that I wrote it,
but I took it from something.

00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:50.803
My friend, my boule
partner, Lulu,

00:23:50.803 --> 00:23:53.507
his parents spoke that as their
main language,

00:23:53.507 --> 00:23:55.368
but he couldn't correct it.
 

00:23:55.368 --> 00:23:58.160
Those languages are
disappearing.

00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:02.397
The point of all this is that
now the more we know about

00:24:02.397 --> 00:24:06.558
national self-identity,
it's possible to have more than

00:24:06.558 --> 00:24:07.868
one identity.
 

00:24:07.868 --> 00:24:11.930
It's also just a leap of faith
to say, "Who are you?"

00:24:11.930 --> 00:24:13.190
You ask who they are.
 

00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:15.000
That they're going to say,
"Well,

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:15.994
I'm German,"
or "I'm French"

00:24:15.994 --> 00:24:17.323
is going to be the first thing
that they're going to say.

00:24:17.323 --> 00:24:18.473
They may say,
"I'm from this

00:24:18.473 --> 00:24:19.846
village,"
or "I'm from this

00:24:19.846 --> 00:24:21.180
family,"
or "I'm from this

00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:22.741
region,"
or "I'm Catholic,"

00:24:22.741 --> 00:24:24.420
or Protestant,
or Jewish, or Muslim,

00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:27.088
some response like that.
 

00:24:27.088 --> 00:24:30.750
But yet when we think of
nationalism,

00:24:30.750 --> 00:24:36.912
we think of these languages as
being motors for elites,

00:24:36.912 --> 00:24:40.421
first,
and then ordinary people to

00:24:40.421 --> 00:24:45.476
demand that the borders of
states be drawn in a way that

00:24:45.476 --> 00:24:48.048
reflects their ethnicity.
 

00:24:48.048 --> 00:24:51.294
After World War I in the Treaty
of Versailles,

00:24:51.294 --> 00:24:54.826
you've gone to war over the
whole damn question of

00:24:54.826 --> 00:24:55.980
nationalism.
 

00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:58.750
All these millions of people
get killed,

00:24:58.750 --> 00:25:03.380
dying in terrible ways--gas and
everything else,

00:25:03.380 --> 00:25:07.820
flamethrowers and machine guns
and all this stuff that we'll

00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:08.798
talk about.
 

00:25:08.798 --> 00:25:10.971
And, so, they say,
"If we draw the lines

00:25:10.971 --> 00:25:13.242
around these people and give
everybody a state,

00:25:13.242 --> 00:25:14.328
that will be cool.
 

00:25:14.328 --> 00:25:16.490
Then we won't have wars
anymore."

00:25:16.490 --> 00:25:19.596
So, they get all these big maps
and these mapmakers and they try

00:25:19.596 --> 00:25:22.557
to draw these state boundaries
after the collapse of the four

00:25:22.557 --> 00:25:23.150
empires.
 

00:25:23.150 --> 00:25:24.460
It doesn't work.
 

00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:25.380
You can't do it.
 

00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:27.038
You've got winners and you've
got losers.

00:25:27.038 --> 00:25:28.528
If you're going to punish the
losers,

00:25:28.528 --> 00:25:31.609
like Hungary,
then you leave Hungary this

00:25:31.609 --> 00:25:36.231
small country with much of its
population living on the other

00:25:36.231 --> 00:25:39.101
side of borders,
and either imagining that that

00:25:39.101 --> 00:25:41.864
should still be part of Hungary,
or wanting themselves to live

00:25:41.864 --> 00:25:44.414
back in Hungary where there
would be nothing for them at

00:25:44.414 --> 00:25:44.740
all.
 

00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:48.657
Yet, the period we're talking
about and the period I began

00:25:48.657 --> 00:25:52.163
with, you've got this
mobilization of elites saying,

00:25:52.163 --> 00:25:53.470
"Holy cow!
 

00:25:53.470 --> 00:25:55.598
We need our own state."
 

00:25:55.598 --> 00:25:58.685
Remember a line I already gave
you a lecture or two ago,

00:25:58.685 --> 00:26:01.605
all these Czechs sitting in
1848 in a room like this,

00:26:01.605 --> 00:26:02.838
not quite as nice.
 

00:26:02.838 --> 00:26:05.798
They say, "If the ceiling
falls in, that's the end of the

00:26:05.798 --> 00:26:07.348
Czech national movement."
 

00:26:07.348 --> 00:26:11.861
Between 1848,
the springtime of the peoples,

00:26:11.861 --> 00:26:15.974
and 1914,
you have millions of people

00:26:15.974 --> 00:26:18.220
who,
a couple decades before that,

00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:23.954
had absolutely no sense or very
little sense of being Slovene,

00:26:23.954 --> 00:26:27.338
or Slovak, or Croat,
or whatever,

00:26:27.338 --> 00:26:31.285
who are suddenly making
national demands and wanting to

00:26:31.285 --> 00:26:35.742
have a separate state within the
context--or to be independent

00:26:35.742 --> 00:26:38.519
from the Austria-Hungarian
Empire.

00:26:38.519 --> 00:26:41.732
One of those people was the
sixteen-year-old boy,

00:26:41.732 --> 00:26:44.622
Princip,
who blows the brains out of

00:26:44.622 --> 00:26:49.405
Franz Ferdinand and his wife
when this car backs up the wrong

00:26:49.405 --> 00:26:52.556
street in Sarajevo,
although some of his friends

00:26:52.556 --> 00:26:54.390
were out there trying to get
him, too.

00:26:54.390 --> 00:27:00.490
That's just a way of kind of
thinking about that stuff.

00:27:04.900 --> 00:27:09.299
Let me give you a couple of
examples here I wrote down.

00:27:09.299 --> 00:27:15.028
Ukraine is a huge country,
a huge important country,

00:27:15.028 --> 00:27:18.821
very contested relationship
with Russia now because of

00:27:18.821 --> 00:27:23.827
having gotten Crimea,
and Russia wants to have Crimea

00:27:23.827 --> 00:27:25.630
and all of this.
 

00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:28.395
It's a highly contested
relationship because of the

00:27:28.395 --> 00:27:31.548
number of Russians who live in
Ukraine and all of that.

00:27:31.548 --> 00:27:34.630
For Ukrainians,
the sense that Ukraine always

00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:37.220
existed is always taken as a
given.

00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:39.548
The first Ukrainian grammar
book,

00:27:39.548 --> 00:27:41.880
and this is not dissing
Ukrainians or anybody,

00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:45.465
but I'm just saying that the
reality is that the first

00:27:45.465 --> 00:27:49.053
Ukrainian grammar book was
published not in 1311 or in

00:27:49.053 --> 00:27:52.826
1511,
but in 1819 is the very first

00:27:52.826 --> 00:27:53.358
one.
 

00:27:53.358 --> 00:27:56.434
The first Czech-German
dictionary--if you're going to

00:27:56.434 --> 00:28:00.102
have a national identity you've
got to have a dictionary so you

00:28:00.102 --> 00:28:03.059
can translate things between
German and Czech.

00:28:03.059 --> 00:28:05.660
It's a long publication process.
 

00:28:05.660 --> 00:28:10.930
It's published in 1935 to 1939,
A to Z.

00:28:10.930 --> 00:28:13.417
The first Czech national
organization,

00:28:13.417 --> 00:28:16.309
the one I just described,
starts in 1846.

00:28:16.309 --> 00:28:17.900
That's pretty recent.
 

00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:20.848
The first Norwegian grammar
book,

00:28:20.848 --> 00:28:25.942
which distinguished Norwegian
as a separate language and a

00:28:25.942 --> 00:28:30.319
separate identity from say
Swedish and Danish,

00:28:30.319 --> 00:28:32.750
is not until 1848.
 

00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:38.997
The first dictionary that is
making a distinction between

00:28:38.997 --> 00:28:43.460
Norwegian and Danish isn't until
1850.

00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:47.430
That's what I mean about the
construction of national

00:28:47.430 --> 00:28:48.269
identity.
 

00:28:48.269 --> 00:28:54.607
You have to have a sense that
you are part of this imagined

00:28:54.607 --> 00:28:55.920
community.
 

00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:59.201
Having said that,
before I talk about a counter

00:28:59.201 --> 00:29:01.769
example, let me do this like
that.

00:29:01.769 --> 00:29:03.808
Why not?
 

00:29:03.808 --> 00:29:08.761
Let me give you a couple
examples that I hope make the

00:29:08.761 --> 00:29:09.509
point.
 

00:29:09.509 --> 00:29:13.578
These I'm drawing from Timothy
Snyder.

00:29:13.578 --> 00:29:17.605
Let's look at why at the end of
the nineteenth century

00:29:17.605 --> 00:29:20.190
Lithuanian nationalism develops.
 

00:29:20.190 --> 00:29:23.375
You know Lithuania,
capital is Vilnius,

00:29:23.375 --> 00:29:26.730
big tall basketball players
like Sabonis,

00:29:26.730 --> 00:29:28.910
who played in the NBA.
 

00:29:28.910 --> 00:29:35.098
Why Lithuanian nationalism
rapidly develops,

00:29:35.098 --> 00:29:36.980
but only at the end of the
nineteenth century,

00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:42.501
and Belarusian nationalism
doesn't develop at all until way

00:29:42.501 --> 00:29:47.930
in--it's even pushing it to say
in the 1920s and 1930s.

00:29:47.930 --> 00:29:50.598
Now there's this huge
Belarus--I was in Poland.

00:29:50.598 --> 00:29:51.808
The various times I've been to
Poland.

00:29:51.808 --> 00:29:54.905
There was a huge dinner with
all these Belarusians who most

00:29:54.905 --> 00:29:58.215
of them were dissidents and are
there to discuss the history of

00:29:58.215 --> 00:30:01.464
Belarus,
but none of them would be

00:30:01.464 --> 00:30:07.599
claiming that Belarus had a
self-identity before the 1930s.

00:30:07.599 --> 00:30:09.670
But Lithuania existed.
 

00:30:09.670 --> 00:30:13.630
Lithuania was part of the
Polish-Lithuania commonwealth,

00:30:13.630 --> 00:30:17.943
which exists basically until
the last partition of Poland in

00:30:17.943 --> 00:30:20.170
1795,
when Poland gets munched,

00:30:20.170 --> 00:30:24.328
bouffé,
by the great powers.

00:30:24.328 --> 00:30:27.839
Who do these people think they
were?

00:30:27.839 --> 00:30:29.930
They think they're Polish.
 

00:30:29.930 --> 00:30:32.430
They consider themselves Polish.
 

00:30:32.430 --> 00:30:36.750
Poles already had a basis for
nationalism.

00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:38.009
They had a written language.
 

00:30:38.009 --> 00:30:40.950
They have heroes, Chopin.
 

00:30:40.950 --> 00:30:45.690
Chopin didn't go to Paris as a
refugee from Russian repression.

00:30:45.690 --> 00:30:47.390
He went there to further his
musical career.

00:30:47.390 --> 00:30:52.777
But anyway, he wrote lots that
had to do with Polish national

00:30:52.777 --> 00:30:55.920
themes, folklore and all of
that.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:06.156
There have been dukes of
Lithuania, grand dukes,

00:31:06.156 --> 00:31:10.578
but they didn't accept
Lithuanian as a language.

00:31:10.578 --> 00:31:14.730
If they wanted to get anywhere,
they tried to pass themselves

00:31:14.730 --> 00:31:15.769
off as Poles.
 

00:31:15.769 --> 00:31:20.247
Pilsudski, a name you will come
back to who destroyed the Polish

00:31:20.247 --> 00:31:22.773
republic,
as one after another of

00:31:22.773 --> 00:31:26.413
European states goes
authoritarian in the 1920s and

00:31:26.413 --> 00:31:27.068
1930s.
 

00:31:27.068 --> 00:31:31.442
Pilsudski, who was the hero of
the miracle of the Vistula River

00:31:31.442 --> 00:31:35.885
when the Polish army turns back
the Red Army at the end of World

00:31:35.885 --> 00:31:38.990
War I in just sort of an amazing
moment.

00:31:38.990 --> 00:31:46.980
Pilsudski himself was
Lithuanian.

00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:49.190
But he considered himself
Polish.

00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:51.538
He was absolutely a Lithuanian.
 

00:31:51.538 --> 00:31:55.240
Yet there was a Lithuanian
language, but it was not spoken

00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:56.279
by the elites.
 

00:31:56.279 --> 00:31:59.009
Who spoke the Lithuanian
language?

00:31:59.009 --> 00:32:01.098
It was spoken by the peasants.
 

00:32:01.098 --> 00:32:02.930
At the end of the nineteenth
century,

00:32:02.930 --> 00:32:06.842
you've suddenly got all these
Lithuanian intellectuals and

00:32:06.842 --> 00:32:10.480
grand dukes and priests and
various people saying,

00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:11.630
"Wait a minute.
 

00:32:11.630 --> 00:32:16.528
We are Lithuanians and happily,
the Lithuanian peasantry has

00:32:16.528 --> 00:32:18.769
saved our language."
 

00:32:18.769 --> 00:32:22.974
The last Lithuanian duke who
spoke Lithuanian died before

00:32:22.974 --> 00:32:27.028
Columbus discovered America,
Tim Snyder informed me.

00:32:27.028 --> 00:32:29.256
Some may say,
"These Lithuanian

00:32:29.256 --> 00:32:32.752
peasants, we won't treat them
anymore as the scum of the

00:32:32.752 --> 00:32:33.390
earth.
 

00:32:33.390 --> 00:32:36.848
They have preserved our
language for us."

00:32:36.848 --> 00:32:40.298
Suddenly, you have poets
writing in Lithuanian.

00:32:40.298 --> 00:32:45.549
It's no longer a disgrace to be
seen as a Lithuanian.

00:32:45.549 --> 00:32:49.710
One of these poets,
a guy called Kudirka,

00:32:49.710 --> 00:32:55.172
who died in 1899,
he recalled when he was in

00:32:55.172 --> 00:32:58.730
school as a smart Lithuanian
kid, he said,

00:32:58.730 --> 00:33:02.083
"My self preservation
instinct told me not to speak in

00:33:02.083 --> 00:33:05.608
Lithuanian and to make sure that
no one noticed that my father

00:33:05.608 --> 00:33:09.308
wore a rough peasant's coat and
could only speak Lithuanian.

00:33:09.308 --> 00:33:12.271
I did my best to speak Polish,
even though I spoke it

00:33:12.271 --> 00:33:13.068
badly."
 

00:33:13.068 --> 00:33:15.088
Polish is a terribly difficult
language.

00:33:15.088 --> 00:33:16.759
There's all these sort of
squiggly things.

00:33:16.759 --> 00:33:19.868
Things don't pronounce like you
think they're supposed to.

00:33:19.868 --> 00:33:23.450
I don't do very well at picking
up Polish.

00:33:23.450 --> 00:33:26.348
"When my father and other
relatives visited me,

00:33:26.348 --> 00:33:29.311
I stayed away from them when I
could see that fellow students

00:33:29.311 --> 00:33:31.038
or gentlemen were
watching."

00:33:31.038 --> 00:33:34.945
He was embarrassed to be
basically Lithuanian and the son

00:33:34.945 --> 00:33:36.759
of a Lithuanian peasant.
 

00:33:36.759 --> 00:33:41.702
"I only spoke with them at
ease when we were alone or

00:33:41.702 --> 00:33:42.568
outside.
 

00:33:42.568 --> 00:33:45.529
I saw myself as a Pole and thus
as a gentleman.

00:33:45.529 --> 00:33:49.140
I had imbibed the Polish
spirit."

00:33:49.140 --> 00:33:53.690
By the end of the century he
sees himself as a Lithuanian.

00:33:53.690 --> 00:33:58.090
He is one of these people who
are pushing Lithuanian

00:33:58.090 --> 00:34:00.940
nationalism and it is embraced.
 

00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:03.099
How does this physically happen?
 

00:34:03.099 --> 00:34:07.028
You don't wake up and say,
"I was Polish yesterday

00:34:07.028 --> 00:34:11.768
and a subject of the czar,
because Poland is divided

00:34:11.768 --> 00:34:14.530
between Prussia,
Austria-Hungary,

00:34:14.530 --> 00:34:15.739
and Russia.
 

00:34:15.739 --> 00:34:17.824
But if you were in the Russian
part of what they called

00:34:17.824 --> 00:34:19.329
Congress Poland,
then suddenly today I'm

00:34:19.329 --> 00:34:19.909
Lithuanian.
 

00:34:19.909 --> 00:34:20.960
How does that happen?
 

00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:24.610
Because Lithuania is next to
Germany.

00:34:24.610 --> 00:34:26.820
This is also something that
will make you again think of

00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:28.349
what I said about the
Enlightenment.

00:34:28.349 --> 00:34:34.909
Lots of literature is smuggled
into Lithuania in Lithuanian.

00:34:34.909 --> 00:34:39.940
Therefore, there's this wild
profusion of Lithuanian

00:34:39.940 --> 00:34:45.364
literature that comes into
Lithuania, which of course as

00:34:45.364 --> 00:34:48.619
you know was not independent.
 

00:34:48.619 --> 00:34:50.300
It was part of the Russian
Empire.

00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:54.690
So, there's another reason,
too, which is for the Russian

00:34:54.690 --> 00:34:58.688
imperial secret police,
the ones that they're really

00:34:58.688 --> 00:35:00.099
worried about.
 

00:35:00.099 --> 00:35:03.923
They're worried about the
Poles, because the Poles have

00:35:03.923 --> 00:35:06.119
risen up in 1831 and in 1863.
 

00:35:06.119 --> 00:35:08.501
So they're on the lookout for
people that are saying,

00:35:08.501 --> 00:35:09.599
"Hey, I'm Polish.
 

00:35:09.599 --> 00:35:10.849
We want a Polish state."
 

00:35:10.849 --> 00:35:11.960
They don't pay much attention.
 

00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:14.903
They don't really care about
these Lithuanians who are

00:35:14.903 --> 00:35:16.849
discovering their own
self-identity,

00:35:16.849 --> 00:35:19.349
who are constructing their
self-identity.

00:35:19.349 --> 00:35:21.500
Why doesn't it happen in
Belarus?

00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:24.673
I don't have time to tell you
very much about this,

00:35:24.673 --> 00:35:28.291
but the main thing is that
Belarus is a long way away from

00:35:28.291 --> 00:35:29.880
anywhere at the time.
 

00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:34.112
There isn't any kind of elite
in Belarus that embraces

00:35:34.112 --> 00:35:35.949
Belarussian anything.
 

00:35:35.949 --> 00:35:41.442
The language has not seen part
of a national self-identity that

00:35:41.442 --> 00:35:46.579
basically does not exist and
would not exist until at least

00:35:46.579 --> 00:35:48.530
after World War I.
 

00:35:48.530 --> 00:35:52.922
Now Lithuanians will look back
on their country as if Lithuania

00:35:52.922 --> 00:35:56.039
had always had this sort of
self-identity.

00:35:56.039 --> 00:36:00.010
Part of the Polish-Lithuanian
commonwealth,

00:36:00.010 --> 00:36:05.775
that was more basically a
Polish operation and it was a

00:36:05.775 --> 00:36:11.967
territorial thing more than any
kind of construction of two

00:36:11.967 --> 00:36:16.239
peoples participating in this
thing.

00:36:16.239 --> 00:36:20.000
Furthermore,
Belarussians were not allowed

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:23.210
to publish in their own
language.

00:36:23.210 --> 00:36:26.349
Whereas Lithuanian priests
began giving sermons in

00:36:26.349 --> 00:36:30.192
Lithuanian and you've got all
this written material coming in

00:36:30.192 --> 00:36:31.409
the vernacular.
 

00:36:31.409 --> 00:36:34.690
Nobody read Belarussian in
church.

00:36:34.690 --> 00:36:38.293
There were no priests to say
that "this is our

00:36:38.293 --> 00:36:39.518
language."
 

00:36:39.518 --> 00:36:46.753
Belarussians who were literate
could read Polish or Russian or

00:36:46.753 --> 00:36:54.699
both, but in many cases not what
would become Belarussian at all.

00:36:54.699 --> 00:36:58.360
By the end of the nineteenth
century when you've got these

00:36:58.360 --> 00:37:01.764
other people insisting that
"we're Slovenes"

00:37:01.764 --> 00:37:05.362
and "we're this and
that," Belarussian speakers

00:37:05.362 --> 00:37:09.409
called themselves Russian if
they were Orthodox religion.

00:37:09.409 --> 00:37:12.099
They called themselves Polish
if they were Roman Catholic.

00:37:12.099 --> 00:37:13.871
If they were simply looking out
for themselves,

00:37:13.871 --> 00:37:15.260
they just called themselves
local.

00:37:15.260 --> 00:37:19.039
They said, "We live in the
Russian empire and that's who we

00:37:19.039 --> 00:37:19.760
are."
 

00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:21.429
There was no sense of being
Belarussian.

00:37:21.429 --> 00:37:25.440
There are different outcomes in
all of this stuff.

00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:30.929
Having said that,
we're going to get there.

00:37:30.929 --> 00:37:34.469
Let me give you another example.
 

00:37:34.469 --> 00:37:40.085
I want to find this date that
will make you at least realize

00:37:40.085 --> 00:37:45.702
that you can have a national
identity and have more than one

00:37:45.702 --> 00:37:46.940
language.
 

00:37:46.940 --> 00:37:48.219
It's very complex.
 

00:37:48.219 --> 00:37:51.023
I guess the most interesting
case now would be Belgium,

00:37:51.023 --> 00:37:53.570
which I don't have a lot of
time to talk about.

00:37:53.570 --> 00:37:59.677
In Belgium, I have friend who
works in the Belgian Ministry of

00:37:59.677 --> 00:38:01.880
Culture in Brussels.
 

00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:05.838
About seven years ago I asked
him, "Do you think Belgium

00:38:05.838 --> 00:38:07.949
will exist in ten years?"
 

00:38:07.949 --> 00:38:09.809
He said, "I hope not."
 

00:38:09.809 --> 00:38:12.960
This guy works for the Belgian
Ministry of Culture.

00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:18.659
This reflects the sharp
antagonism between the Flemish,

00:38:18.659 --> 00:38:22.860
who basically live in the north
and east,

00:38:22.860 --> 00:38:26.929
but above all the northern
parts of Belgium,

00:38:26.929 --> 00:38:30.050
and who are more prosperous and
who are more numerous,

00:38:30.050 --> 00:38:32.130
about say fifty-five percent of
the population.

00:38:32.130 --> 00:38:34.530
Their tensions with the
Walloons,

00:38:34.530 --> 00:38:37.610
that is the French speakers,
Liège,

00:38:37.610 --> 00:38:42.949
and Arlon and all those places,
and also in Brussels,

00:38:42.949 --> 00:38:48.739
which is technically part of
the Flemish zone.

00:38:48.739 --> 00:38:52.876
Because of the bureaucracy and
because Brussels is the most

00:38:52.876 --> 00:38:55.945
important city,
it has become this sort of

00:38:55.945 --> 00:38:59.931
third place hotly contested by
the Flemish and real serious

00:38:59.931 --> 00:39:01.170
tensions there.
 

00:39:01.170 --> 00:39:05.985
If you ask in French what time
the train is to Bruges,

00:39:05.985 --> 00:39:08.619
they're not going to reply.
 

00:39:08.619 --> 00:39:09.670
They know perfectly well.
 

00:39:09.670 --> 00:39:12.269
They just simply won't reply.
 

00:39:12.269 --> 00:39:14.869
Not all of them,
but those are serious tensions

00:39:14.869 --> 00:39:17.070
that are compounded also by the
fact that there's going to be,

00:39:17.070 --> 00:39:21.164
not everybody,
but the far right is really

00:39:21.164 --> 00:39:24.889
tied to Flemish self-identity.
 

00:39:24.889 --> 00:39:27.146
The Walloons,
that is the French,

00:39:27.146 --> 00:39:31.168
many of the French speakers
want to be attached to France,

00:39:31.168 --> 00:39:33.849
see their lives as very
different.

00:39:33.849 --> 00:39:38.206
Also, the Walloon part of
Belgium is basically the rust

00:39:38.206 --> 00:39:43.130
belt and the Flemish part is
very prosperous in comparison.

00:39:43.130 --> 00:39:46.922
Yet Belgium,
which didn't exist legally

00:39:46.922 --> 00:39:53.010
until 1831, the revolution of
1830 and 1831 is still there.

00:39:53.010 --> 00:39:56.206
By the way, there's also five
percent tacked on after

00:39:56.206 --> 00:39:59.710
Versailles around a town called
Eupen who speak German.

00:39:59.710 --> 00:40:01.480
Anyway, there we go.
 

00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:02.909
But Belgium is still there.
 

00:40:02.909 --> 00:40:05.280
When I'm in Belgium,
which I am frequently,

00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:07.876
I think, "Now this is
really Europe,"

00:40:07.876 --> 00:40:09.909
because of the complexity of
it.

00:40:09.909 --> 00:40:14.206
You can have a national
identity without having a single

00:40:14.206 --> 00:40:18.190
dominant language,
if the two sides are tolerant.

00:40:18.190 --> 00:40:21.925
Let me give you another quick
example, and then we've got to

00:40:21.925 --> 00:40:25.219
rock and roll onto the A-H
Empire, a shortcut now.

00:40:25.219 --> 00:40:26.250
Not Austria-Hungary.
 

00:40:26.250 --> 00:40:27.735
I've got to save time,
so "A-H"

00:40:27.735 --> 00:40:28.070
Empire.
 

00:40:28.070 --> 00:40:29.389
What about Switzerland?
 

00:40:29.389 --> 00:40:30.750
Here you've got Switzerland.
 

00:40:30.750 --> 00:40:33.295
If I remember correctly,
the statistics,

00:40:33.295 --> 00:40:36.626
I think the French speaking
population is twenty-two

00:40:36.626 --> 00:40:37.409
percent.
 

00:40:37.409 --> 00:40:42.717
German speaking or Swiss
Deutsch speaking population is

00:40:42.717 --> 00:40:48.420
about maybe seventy-one percent,
or something like that.

00:40:48.420 --> 00:40:52.335
You've got an Italian speaking
population of about five

00:40:52.335 --> 00:40:53.059
percent.
 

00:40:53.059 --> 00:40:55.088
And you also have another
language called Romansch,

00:40:55.088 --> 00:40:57.360
which is spoken only by a few
hundred thousand people.

00:40:57.360 --> 00:41:00.802
That's three languages already,
plus English,

00:41:00.802 --> 00:41:04.168
because of the international
role of Geneva,

00:41:04.168 --> 00:41:07.610
is the fourth major or
recognized language in

00:41:07.610 --> 00:41:09.018
Switzerland.
 

00:41:09.018 --> 00:41:12.695
Switzerland now is so
prosperous, and full of

00:41:12.695 --> 00:41:16.789
chocolate, and full of banks,
and full of watches,

00:41:16.789 --> 00:41:18.460
and all of that.
 

00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:21.492
You think of everybody yodeling
and cows running around and

00:41:21.492 --> 00:41:24.579
everybody's very happy and
eating perch out of the lakes.

00:41:24.579 --> 00:41:29.829
But the Swiss have to create
this sense that they have always

00:41:29.829 --> 00:41:31.230
been a nation.
 

00:41:31.230 --> 00:41:32.630
But they haven't.
 

00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:36.550
The decentralized,
federalist nature of

00:41:36.550 --> 00:41:39.750
Switzerland was always there.
 

00:41:39.750 --> 00:41:44.001
During the Reformation,
to say somebody was turning

00:41:44.001 --> 00:41:48.487
Swiss meant that they were
rejecting the demands of their

00:41:48.487 --> 00:41:51.112
lords,
and rejecting the religion

00:41:51.112 --> 00:41:54.900
imposed by their lords and
turning to Protestantism,

00:41:54.900 --> 00:41:57.215
if they were in a Catholic area
or to Catholicism if they were

00:41:57.215 --> 00:41:58.090
in a Protestant area.
 

00:41:58.090 --> 00:42:03.918
The Swiss were big time
mercenaries and big time

00:42:03.918 --> 00:42:05.159
farmers.
 

00:42:05.159 --> 00:42:10.112
But Switzerland fought its last
war early in the nineteenth

00:42:10.112 --> 00:42:12.760
century and has been neutral.
 

00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:15.681
It's a very complicated story,
what happened in Switzerland

00:42:15.681 --> 00:42:16.789
during World War II.
 

00:42:16.789 --> 00:42:17.599
It's very tragic.
 

00:42:17.599 --> 00:42:21.273
The Swiss turned so many Jews
back at the frontier and sent

00:42:21.273 --> 00:42:24.251
them back to Germany,
and laundering Nazi money,

00:42:24.251 --> 00:42:25.329
and all that.
 

00:42:25.329 --> 00:42:29.793
I'm not dumping on the Swiss,
but it's a complicated story in

00:42:29.793 --> 00:42:32.099
the case of their neutrality.
 

00:42:32.099 --> 00:42:38.668
They decided in 1891,
on the 600^(th) anniversary of

00:42:38.668 --> 00:42:46.010
the Swiss confederation that
Switzerland began in 1291.

00:42:46.010 --> 00:42:49.661
That a bunch of people got
together between all the cows

00:42:49.661 --> 00:42:53.510
and eating chocolate and all
that stuff, and they announced

00:42:53.510 --> 00:42:55.570
that they were Switzerland.
 

00:42:55.570 --> 00:42:59.916
Here's again what Anderson
means about this sort of

00:42:59.916 --> 00:43:03.755
imagined community,
that you're inventing a kind of

00:43:03.755 --> 00:43:06.257
date that you said,
"We've been like that

00:43:06.257 --> 00:43:08.469
since then and that's all there
is to it."

00:43:08.469 --> 00:43:11.545
But if you've got all these
different languages and the

00:43:11.545 --> 00:43:14.619
languages are not as far apart
as French and Dutch,

00:43:14.619 --> 00:43:16.230
well in a way they are because
Dutch is really,

00:43:16.230 --> 00:43:17.880
although the Dutch would not
see it that way,

00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:19.070
but is a German dialect.
 

00:43:19.070 --> 00:43:21.697
Nonetheless,
the Swiss are a lot better at

00:43:21.697 --> 00:43:25.157
learning each other's language
than the French speakers

00:43:25.157 --> 00:43:28.815
certainly are at learning Dutch,
which they view as impossible

00:43:28.815 --> 00:43:31.655
and don't like their kids having
to learning it in school and all

00:43:31.655 --> 00:43:32.010
that.
 

00:43:32.010 --> 00:43:33.018
It's terribly complicated.
 

00:43:33.018 --> 00:43:37.840
So, they imagine this
community, but it exists.

00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:38.768
Switzerland exists.
 

00:43:38.768 --> 00:43:42.001
People have a sense of being
Swiss, despite these different

00:43:42.001 --> 00:43:42.670
languages.
 

00:43:42.670 --> 00:43:45.320
There are not the economic
disparities.

00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:48.670
Well, there are between urban
and rural life,

00:43:48.670 --> 00:43:53.280
but nothing like the disparity
between the Flemish parts of

00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:56.699
Belgium and the French parts of
Belgium,

00:43:56.699 --> 00:43:59.340
if you exclude Brussels and all
that.

00:43:59.340 --> 00:44:04.246
Let me end in the last five
minutes and seven seconds that

00:44:04.246 --> 00:44:05.969
is allotted to me.
 

00:44:05.969 --> 00:44:08.690
Let me end with a counter
example, which you can read

00:44:08.690 --> 00:44:09.110
about.
 

00:44:09.110 --> 00:44:12.400
I said at the beginning,
inspired by the sheer horror of

00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:15.092
the Balkans,
and some of you aren't old

00:44:15.092 --> 00:44:17.268
enough to remember,
certainly not,

00:44:17.268 --> 00:44:20.358
my god, I am,
all the stuff that happened in

00:44:20.358 --> 00:44:21.409
the late 1990s.
 

00:44:21.409 --> 00:44:25.907
You can probably remember all
the massacres and stuff like

00:44:25.907 --> 00:44:26.460
that.
 

00:44:26.460 --> 00:44:29.081
I said at the very beginning of
the hour or the beginning of the

00:44:29.081 --> 00:44:31.579
fifty minutes that people now
tend to look longingly back.

00:44:31.579 --> 00:44:34.320
They say, "The
Austria-Hungarian Empire,

00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:36.500
it sure lasted a long
time."

00:44:36.500 --> 00:44:38.239
You had fifteen major
nationalities.

00:44:38.239 --> 00:44:40.219
It was kind of a balancing act.
 

00:44:40.219 --> 00:44:45.280
It becomes the dual monarchy in
1867, where the Hungarians have,

00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:47.610
more or less,
equal rights.

00:44:47.610 --> 00:44:50.670
You've got Austria and you've
got Hungary.

00:44:50.670 --> 00:44:54.237
But you've got another thirteen
peoples, at least thirteen

00:44:54.237 --> 00:44:56.429
peoples living within the
empire.

00:44:56.429 --> 00:44:58.909
You've got the Croats,
who have their nobility.

00:44:58.909 --> 00:45:01.329
They're kind of given favorable
status.

00:45:01.329 --> 00:45:04.659
This whole thing is sort of
balanced.

00:45:04.659 --> 00:45:07.449
How does the place stay
together?

00:45:07.449 --> 00:45:10.989
How does Austria-Hungary stay
together?

00:45:10.989 --> 00:45:14.407
I end one of those chapters,
that chapter with this very

00:45:14.407 --> 00:45:18.079
famous scene from the parliament
in Vienna where you've got these

00:45:18.079 --> 00:45:21.407
different ethnic groups playing
drums and singing songs and

00:45:21.407 --> 00:45:24.505
trying to disrupt the speeches
by people from the other

00:45:24.505 --> 00:45:25.710
nationalities.
 

00:45:25.710 --> 00:45:29.597
You've got all these problems
with the south Slavs wanting at

00:45:29.597 --> 00:45:33.163
least minimal representation as
sort of this "third

00:45:33.163 --> 00:45:36.210
state" along with Austria
and Hungary.

00:45:36.210 --> 00:45:37.690
How does the thing stay
together?

00:45:37.690 --> 00:45:39.550
Basically, in this way.
 

00:45:39.550 --> 00:45:42.228
I'm just telling you briefly
about things that you can read

00:45:42.228 --> 00:45:44.630
about, but I just wanted to make
some sense of it.

00:45:44.630 --> 00:45:48.978
First of all,
the language of the empire is

00:45:48.978 --> 00:45:49.909
German.
 

00:45:49.909 --> 00:45:54.929
To get somewhere in the
Austria-Hungarian Empire,

00:45:54.929 --> 00:45:57.650
you need to know German.
 

00:45:57.650 --> 00:46:00.516
So, learning German becomes
kind of a social mobility,

00:46:00.516 --> 00:46:03.384
the way that learning French
becomes for somebody from

00:46:03.384 --> 00:46:05.440
Gascony a form of social
mobility.

00:46:05.440 --> 00:46:07.440
You can get a job in the
bureaucracy.

00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:12.083
If you're going to have a
humongous empire going all the

00:46:12.083 --> 00:46:16.389
way to the rugged terrain of
Bosnia-Herzevogina,

00:46:16.389 --> 00:46:19.864
you've got to have officials
and their little hats and their

00:46:19.864 --> 00:46:23.280
little desks who are going to be
running all this stuff.

00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:25.380
You've got to have a language.
 

00:46:25.380 --> 00:46:27.599
The language of the empire is
German.

00:46:27.599 --> 00:46:31.239
This does not mean that people
feel that they're German.

00:46:31.239 --> 00:46:32.550
After all, they're not German.
 

00:46:32.550 --> 00:46:35.699
They're German speakers within
the Austria-Hungarian empire.

00:46:35.699 --> 00:46:39.489
It gives them an allegiance to
this apparatus.

00:46:39.489 --> 00:46:41.570
Secondly, the middle class.
 

00:46:41.570 --> 00:46:45.860
The middle class is German,
largely, except in Budapest

00:46:45.860 --> 00:46:47.690
where it's Hungarian.
 

00:46:47.690 --> 00:46:50.590
Still, many Germans live in
Budapest as well.

00:46:50.590 --> 00:46:52.840
One of the things I wish I had
time to talk about,

00:46:52.840 --> 00:46:54.150
but you can't talk about
everything,

00:46:54.150 --> 00:46:57.300
is that what you've got in
these cities,

00:46:57.300 --> 00:46:59.340
and I mentioned this in
reference the other day.

00:46:59.340 --> 00:47:01.967
Cities of all of Eastern Europe
and central Europe,

00:47:01.967 --> 00:47:04.699
you have kind of an
ethnicization of these cities.

00:47:04.699 --> 00:47:07.594
All of the cities,
whether you're talking about

00:47:07.594 --> 00:47:09.460
Budapest or you're talking about
Warsaw,

00:47:09.460 --> 00:47:12.139
or anywhere you're talking
about, even Vilnius,

00:47:12.139 --> 00:47:15.878
you have large German
populations and also large

00:47:15.878 --> 00:47:17.550
Jewish populations.
 

00:47:17.550 --> 00:47:20.335
In the course of the last
decades of the nineteenth

00:47:20.335 --> 00:47:23.704
century,
you have this sort of rival of

00:47:23.704 --> 00:47:28.489
Estonian peasants into Talin,
of Czech peasants into Prague,

00:47:28.489 --> 00:47:32.039
of Hungarian peasants into
Budapest,

00:47:32.039 --> 00:47:35.956
of Lithuanian peasants into
Vilnius, etc.,

00:47:35.956 --> 00:47:36.530
etc.
 

00:47:36.530 --> 00:47:40.019
But you've still got,
in the Austria-Hungarian case,

00:47:40.019 --> 00:47:42.179
you still have,
even in Budapest,

00:47:42.179 --> 00:47:45.059
you still have a large middle
class that is fundamentally

00:47:45.059 --> 00:47:46.909
German and believes in the
empire.

00:47:46.909 --> 00:47:50.440
Next, you've got dynastic
loyalty.

00:47:50.440 --> 00:47:55.514
You've got this old dude,
Franz Joseph,

00:47:55.514 --> 00:47:59.789
who had been there since 1848.
 

00:47:59.789 --> 00:48:03.869
He lives until 1916,
the same guy.

00:48:03.869 --> 00:48:08.260
That makes Victoria seem like
she had a short reign.

00:48:08.260 --> 00:48:12.949
People have an allegiance to
this dynasty.

00:48:12.949 --> 00:48:19.135
The Habsburg Dynasty had been
dominant in central Europe until

00:48:19.135 --> 00:48:25.320
they contest the Prussians and
lose out in the War of 1966.

00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:27.659
So you've got this Franz Joseph.
 

00:48:27.659 --> 00:48:31.119
Also you've got the Catholic
Church.

00:48:31.119 --> 00:48:32.239
There are lots of Protestants.
 

00:48:32.239 --> 00:48:38.760
For example in the Czech lands
in Bohemia,

00:48:38.760 --> 00:48:42.204
where Slovakia is almost
overwhelmingly Catholic in what

00:48:42.204 --> 00:48:45.210
would become Czechoslovakia and
then divorce,

00:48:45.210 --> 00:48:51.260
amicably enough, in 1993.
 

00:48:51.260 --> 00:48:55.469
Croatia is overwhelming
Catholic, aggressively so.

00:48:55.469 --> 00:49:00.398
Despite the fact you have these
huge Muslim enclaves in the old

00:49:00.398 --> 00:49:03.260
what had been the Ottoman
empire,

00:49:03.260 --> 00:49:06.230
you still have this church as a
unifying force,

00:49:06.230 --> 00:49:08.480
not for everybody and certainly
not for the Jews,

00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:11.320
not for the gypsies,
of whom are the Roma,

00:49:11.320 --> 00:49:15.079
who are very many there,
and not for protestants and not

00:49:15.079 --> 00:49:18.461
for orthodox Serbs,
which is part of the tensions

00:49:18.461 --> 00:49:19.400
there as well.
 

00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:21.500
They saw Russia as being their
protector.

00:49:21.500 --> 00:49:24.630
You can read more about that,
but that's another thing.

00:49:24.630 --> 00:49:25.980
Finally, you've got the army.
 

00:49:25.980 --> 00:49:29.500
The army is a form of social
promotion as well.

00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:34.190
The army doesn't have the bad
reputation that the French army

00:49:34.190 --> 00:49:38.800
did for shooting down young
girls, young women protesting in

00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:39.739
strikes.
 

00:49:39.739 --> 00:49:44.445
It doesn't have the reputation
that the brutal Garda Civila did

00:49:44.445 --> 00:49:45.280
in Spain.
 

00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:50.179
The army is seen as a useful
way of representing the empire.

00:49:50.179 --> 00:49:51.800
It has a good reputation.
 

00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:56.349
German, the language,
is the language of command.

00:49:56.349 --> 00:50:00.844
These soldiers and soldiers are
drawn from all of these

00:50:00.844 --> 00:50:04.173
nationalities,
they at least have that in

00:50:04.173 --> 00:50:05.090
common.
 

00:50:09.820 --> 00:50:11.581
To conclude,
the most important question to

00:50:11.581 --> 00:50:14.090
ask about this empire,
particularly in reference to

00:50:14.090 --> 00:50:17.429
what I've been saying about this
whole hour is to not look at why

00:50:17.429 --> 00:50:20.815
it came apart,
but to look at how it held

00:50:20.815 --> 00:50:22.510
together so long.
 

00:50:22.510 --> 00:50:28.012
Given the horrors perpetuated
on Europe by aggressive

00:50:28.012 --> 00:50:31.849
nationalism from then,
and even before,

00:50:31.849 --> 00:50:35.210
as during the French Revolution
to this very day,

00:50:35.210 --> 00:50:37.860
sometimes,
and I never thought I'd ever

00:50:37.860 --> 00:50:41.590
say this about me looking
nostalgically back to an empire,

00:50:41.590 --> 00:50:46.150
but it is interesting and at
least food for thought.

00:50:46.150 --> 00:50:48.074
On that note,
bon appétit and

00:50:48.074 --> 00:50:49.130
see you on Wednesday.

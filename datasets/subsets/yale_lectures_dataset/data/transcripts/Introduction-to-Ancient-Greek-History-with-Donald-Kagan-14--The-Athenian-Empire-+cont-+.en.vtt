00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:05.933
Professor Donald
Kagan: The Persians were

00:00:05.933 --> 00:00:10.878
busy with other things as well
as thinking about returning to

00:00:10.878 --> 00:00:15.000
Greece because the great king
was not willing,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.282
and understandably in a way,
to accept his defeat by these

00:00:20.282 --> 00:00:24.010
few puny Greeks,
because of the consequences

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:27.367
that would have for the
reputation of Persia,

00:00:27.367 --> 00:00:31.564
and just as a matter of
personal honor these kings would

00:00:31.564 --> 00:00:35.380
not have been glad to accept
such an outcome.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:39.806
I won't drag you through the
details of the invasion by the

00:00:39.806 --> 00:00:42.785
Persians in 480.
After all, we're making you

00:00:42.785 --> 00:00:45.640
read Herodotus,
and the whole problem about it.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.315
But let me simply talk a bit
about the conclusion to the

00:00:50.315 --> 00:00:53.800
great invasion,
the great Persian Wars,

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.735
as we call them,
and also to say something about

00:00:58.735 --> 00:01:04.237
what their meaning was.
The meaning of the defeat

00:01:04.237 --> 00:01:09.496
of the Persians in 479 was
broader than the meaning of

00:01:09.496 --> 00:01:14.740
their defeat at Marathon in 490.
For one thing,

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.420
it involved the entire Greek
nation;

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.581
of course, it wasn't a nation,
but you know I'm using the word

00:01:22.581 --> 00:01:24.531
loosely.
Of course it didn't involve the

00:01:24.531 --> 00:01:26.980
whole of that nation no matter
how loosely I use it,

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:30.423
because if you imagine that
there are over 1,000

00:01:30.423 --> 00:01:33.573
poleis,
there were only 31 who signed

00:01:33.573 --> 00:01:36.870
up to resist the Persian
invasion of 480.

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:41.401
However, they included the most
important, and strongest,

00:01:41.401 --> 00:01:44.720
and largest of the Greek
poleis.

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.513
So, it's not too much of a
stretch to speak of it as a

00:01:49.513 --> 00:01:53.652
Greek victory.
Again, the same issue that

00:01:53.652 --> 00:01:58.678
had been present at Marathon,
the question of whether the

00:01:58.678 --> 00:02:03.524
Greeks would continue to live
their lives free in their

00:02:03.524 --> 00:02:07.825
poleis,
developing their own style,

00:02:07.825 --> 00:02:13.496
their unique style of life or
become another province of the

00:02:13.496 --> 00:02:17.629
Persian Empire just like so many
others.

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:23.018
We can see that in one
wonderful contemporary reference

00:02:23.018 --> 00:02:29.105
to the meaning of the war--it's
in Aeschylus' oldest surviving

00:02:29.105 --> 00:02:34.085
play Persians,
in which the central event is

00:02:34.085 --> 00:02:39.313
the great sea battle at Salamis
in which the Greeks defeat the

00:02:39.313 --> 00:02:42.674
Persian fleet,
which guarantees that the

00:02:42.674 --> 00:02:47.092
Persians will not win a great
victory, even though two more

00:02:47.092 --> 00:02:51.282
decisive battles in the
following year 479 are necessary

00:02:51.282 --> 00:02:56.794
to drive the Persians away.
But here's what Aeschylus

00:02:56.794 --> 00:03:01.590
describes in his play
Persians.

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.064
He's having the story told
by--I'm trying to remember,

00:03:06.064 --> 00:03:10.381
it may well have been a Persian
who's telling the story,

00:03:10.381 --> 00:03:14.120
but in any case--probably not.
It was one of the Greeks.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:19.251
Anyway, here's what he says,
"a mighty shout greeted our

00:03:19.251 --> 00:03:23.861
ears, on you sons of Hellas,
free your homeland,

00:03:23.861 --> 00:03:28.438
free your children,
your wives, the homes of your

00:03:28.438 --> 00:03:32.153
father's gods,
and the tombs of your

00:03:32.153 --> 00:03:34.743
ancestors."
In other words,

00:03:34.743 --> 00:03:40.316
this play was put on something
like--about I think it's about

00:03:40.316 --> 00:03:44.310
seven years after the Battle of
Salamis.

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:49.143
So, it's almost a contemporary
event and you can see that from

00:03:49.143 --> 00:03:53.977
the first the Greeks viewed this
war as being about freedom as

00:03:53.977 --> 00:03:57.940
opposed to many other possible
considerations.

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.931
In the spring,
in the following year in 479,

00:04:01.931 --> 00:04:06.941
there were two great battles
that decided the outcome of the

00:04:06.941 --> 00:04:09.484
war finally.
On the land,

00:04:09.484 --> 00:04:13.530
the battle of Plataea in
southern Boeotia,

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:19.532
in which a great Greek army,
which included the major cities

00:04:19.532 --> 00:04:24.848
including especially Sparta and
Athens took on a powerful

00:04:24.848 --> 00:04:29.310
Persian land army and defeated
them on land.

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.909
Herodotus says on the very same
day--it would be a wonderful

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:36.639
coincidence if it were true.
It may be true.

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:43.030
A sea battle was fought off the
coast of Asia Minor at Mycale,

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.907
where again,
the Greek fleet once more

00:04:46.907 --> 00:04:52.681
destroyed the Persian fleet,
and at that point the Persians

00:04:52.681 --> 00:04:58.009
had no choice but simply to flee
and to try to escape the Greeks,

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:02.310
who were pursuing them and
doing their best to kill as many

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:05.835
of them as they could.
Now, after Mycale,

00:05:05.835 --> 00:05:10.278
a very important event took
place that cast a long shadow

00:05:10.278 --> 00:05:14.959
about the future of what was
going to happen in that part of

00:05:14.959 --> 00:05:18.648
the world.
There was a conference held on

00:05:18.648 --> 00:05:22.229
the island of Samos,
perhaps one of the most

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:26.310
important of the Ionian islands
off the coast,

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:33.204
which brought to the Greek
council that had been conducting

00:05:33.204 --> 00:05:39.029
the war, it brought the island
states of Chios,

00:05:39.029 --> 00:05:43.023
Lesbos, and Samos,
these are the three largest,

00:05:43.023 --> 00:05:48.231
most important islands that are
located off the coast of Asia

00:05:48.231 --> 00:05:51.723
Minor.
All of them had taken advantage

00:05:51.723 --> 00:05:56.631
of the presence of the Greek
forces in that region to rebel

00:05:56.631 --> 00:06:01.455
against the Persians and now
they wanted to be admitted to

00:06:01.455 --> 00:06:06.278
the league that the Greeks had
formed in 481 to resist the

00:06:06.278 --> 00:06:09.941
Persian invasion.
The Greeks referred to

00:06:09.941 --> 00:06:13.501
themselves to that league simply
as the Hellenes,

00:06:13.501 --> 00:06:17.202
the Greeks,
and it's convenient to think

00:06:17.202 --> 00:06:22.718
about it as the Greek League
meant to fight the Persians in

00:06:22.718 --> 00:06:26.516
that war.
Now, this might seem like a

00:06:26.516 --> 00:06:29.937
simple thing to do.
Why not accept these three

00:06:29.937 --> 00:06:32.301
Greek states,
all of them potentially

00:06:32.301 --> 00:06:36.110
powerful and important,
who want join the Greek League.

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:39.601
One thing I think we need to
understand once or we won't

00:06:39.601 --> 00:06:43.474
comprehend the situation at all,
we know that the Persian wars

00:06:43.474 --> 00:06:46.222
are over.
We know that the Persians just

00:06:46.222 --> 00:06:49.874
ran away and weren't going to
come back and challenge this

00:06:49.874 --> 00:06:52.310
Greek victory for the longest
time,

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:57.247
but the Greeks didn't know it.
The Persian Empire was still

00:06:57.247 --> 00:07:00.556
intact;
it was still an extraordinarily

00:07:00.556 --> 00:07:03.850
extensive, rich,
and powerful empire.

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:07.930
There was no reason why the
Greeks should not believe that

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:10.579
the Persians would be coming
again,

00:07:10.579 --> 00:07:14.193
and if we don't grasp that,
then all of what they do now

00:07:14.193 --> 00:07:16.767
makes no sense.
Well, Chios,

00:07:16.767 --> 00:07:21.593
Samos, and Lesbos wanted to be
sure that they would be

00:07:21.593 --> 00:07:25.565
protected by this Greek League,
if and when,

00:07:25.565 --> 00:07:29.726
the Persians came back and
tried to put them back into the

00:07:29.726 --> 00:07:33.404
Persian Empire.
So, there is a conference,

00:07:33.404 --> 00:07:36.949
but there is not a unity of
intention.

00:07:36.949 --> 00:07:40.392
When the Greeks have to
discuss, shall we take these

00:07:40.392 --> 00:07:44.649
people into our league,
basically the Spartans said no,

00:07:44.649 --> 00:07:48.709
and the reasons for that are no
so very strange.

00:07:48.709 --> 00:07:53.054
The Spartans certainly could
conclude with security that

00:07:53.054 --> 00:07:58.029
there wasn't very much danger
that in the foreseeable future,

00:07:58.029 --> 00:08:01.798
the Persians would come
marching into Greece again and

00:08:01.798 --> 00:08:05.637
present a threat to the
Peloponnesus and to the Spartan

00:08:05.637 --> 00:08:09.957
predominance in that area,
and we all know by now that the

00:08:09.957 --> 00:08:13.980
Spartans were most reluctant to
be far from home anyway.

00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:17.677
They didn't like to have to
cross the sea to get to a

00:08:17.677 --> 00:08:21.517
battlefield and didn't want
their army out there on any

00:08:21.517 --> 00:08:25.059
permanent basis.
Everything in their tradition

00:08:25.059 --> 00:08:29.079
said bring the army home,
put an end to this activity,

00:08:29.079 --> 00:08:35.576
and they didn't want to take on
the responsibility of bringing

00:08:35.576 --> 00:08:39.409
these islanders into their
league,

00:08:39.409 --> 00:08:41.879
so that they would have to go
and fight for their freedom.

00:08:41.879 --> 00:08:46.305
On the other hand,
the Athenians took the opposite

00:08:46.305 --> 00:08:49.192
view;
they were very much in favor of

00:08:49.192 --> 00:08:52.090
bringing these states into this
thing.

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:24.938
Anyway, the Athenians thought
differently and that's not

00:09:24.938 --> 00:09:28.717
surprising either,
because their situation was

00:09:28.717 --> 00:09:32.580
quite different from that of the
Spartans.

00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:37.826
They were on the sea;
they were accustomed to be at

00:09:37.826 --> 00:09:40.517
sea.
Moreover, as we've seen and

00:09:40.517 --> 00:09:44.723
said several times,
they had very important supply

00:09:44.723 --> 00:09:48.135
line,
lines of communication and

00:09:48.135 --> 00:09:52.539
transportation,
in order to feed themselves

00:09:52.539 --> 00:09:58.830
they needed to go out there and
have freedom of the seas,

00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:03.778
and that meant that they had to
see to it that the Persians were

00:10:03.778 --> 00:10:08.413
indeed driven from the Aegean
Sea and the Hellespont and the

00:10:08.413 --> 00:10:11.529
straits in general,
and the access to the Black Sea.

00:10:11.529 --> 00:10:16.055
So, for those reasons alone,
the Athenians would have had to

00:10:16.055 --> 00:10:19.659
take seriously this request by
the islanders.

00:10:19.659 --> 00:10:24.024
But it's also true that at
least some of the islanders,

00:10:24.024 --> 00:10:26.611
Samos particularly,
were Ionians,

00:10:26.611 --> 00:10:30.330
as you remember,
kinsmen of the Athenians.

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:33.328
The Athenians were recognized
as the leader of the Ionian

00:10:33.328 --> 00:10:36.491
people.
So, there was that sentimental

00:10:36.491 --> 00:10:40.221
attachment as well.
But most strikingly,

00:10:40.221 --> 00:10:44.913
I think we have to understand
that the Athenians understood

00:10:44.913 --> 00:10:49.766
the Persians have to be kept
away from the Aegean Sea and the

00:10:49.766 --> 00:10:54.859
Athenians also wanted very much,
because ever since the

00:10:54.859 --> 00:10:59.059
rebellion of 499,
the Athenians had wanted to

00:10:59.059 --> 00:11:04.690
liberate the Greeks of Asia
Minor from the Persian rule.

00:11:09.049 --> 00:11:13.649
So, the Athenians won the
argument;

00:11:13.649 --> 00:11:18.505
it was agreed to take these
three island states into the

00:11:18.505 --> 00:11:24.154
Greek League and that meant that
the Greeks would be committed to

00:11:24.154 --> 00:11:29.009
protect them should the Persians
attack them again.

00:11:29.009 --> 00:11:33.015
In accordance with these
decisions, the commander of the

00:11:33.015 --> 00:11:36.860
Spartan fleet out there,
King Leotychidas sailed home

00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:40.203
and took his Spartans,
and I would imagine his

00:11:40.203 --> 00:11:43.567
Peloponnesians with him.
On the other hand,

00:11:43.567 --> 00:11:47.640
the commander of the Athenian
fleet, Xanthippus stayed,

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:52.090
and carried on the war against
the Persians in the area.

00:11:52.090 --> 00:11:53.539
Let me just give you a small
clue.

00:11:53.539 --> 00:11:57.947
Xanthippus will have a
son--sorry he has a son in the

00:11:57.947 --> 00:12:02.778
year 479 whose name is Pericles,
and we will be hearing of

00:12:02.778 --> 00:12:05.830
course a lot about him later on.

00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:14.226
The Persians have fled but
there are a few places in Europe

00:12:14.226 --> 00:12:17.700
that, along the route of their
escape,

00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:22.642
where the Persians still had
control of a town or a city here

00:12:22.642 --> 00:12:27.173
and there, and one of the most
important was the town of

00:12:27.173 --> 00:12:31.516
Sestos,
located on the European side of

00:12:31.516 --> 00:12:36.616
the Dardanelles,
and so Xanthippus besieged the

00:12:36.616 --> 00:12:40.940
city with the Athenian and the
navy,

00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:44.799
and the rest of the Greeks
ships that were still there,

00:12:44.799 --> 00:12:47.873
and after awhile,
took the city by siege and

00:12:47.873 --> 00:12:50.590
cleared the Persians out of
there.

00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:55.583
The result of the war was,
of course, first of all,

00:12:55.583 --> 00:12:59.190
the vindication,
the validation of Greek

00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:02.544
freedom.
Greeks would indeed continue to

00:13:02.544 --> 00:13:06.889
be able to live the lives that
they had been accustomed to.

00:13:06.889 --> 00:13:11.568
But another thing had happened,
which was going to make an

00:13:11.568 --> 00:13:16.083
enormous impact on Greek
life--you perhaps will remember

00:13:16.083 --> 00:13:19.120
that before the Persian
invasion,

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:23.718
but not long before,
I believe it's in the year 482,

00:13:23.718 --> 00:13:29.218
the silver mines in the south
of Attica had yielded an unusual

00:13:29.218 --> 00:13:32.039
strike.
A vein of silver had been

00:13:32.039 --> 00:13:36.211
discovered that was much more
than normal, so much so that

00:13:36.211 --> 00:13:40.309
something had to be decided by
the Athenian assembly.

00:13:40.309 --> 00:13:44.639
What should we do with the
silver?

00:13:44.639 --> 00:13:47.994
It's a wonderful insight into
the way Greeks thought about

00:13:47.994 --> 00:13:50.597
their polis.
The first thought,

00:13:50.597 --> 00:13:53.863
the one that was most popular
to begin with,

00:13:53.863 --> 00:13:58.496
was well, let's take the silver
and divide it up equally among

00:13:58.496 --> 00:14:01.475
the Athenians.
That in some sense the

00:14:01.475 --> 00:14:05.941
polis was a kind of joint
stock company and when there was

00:14:05.941 --> 00:14:09.919
a nice dividend you just dole it
out to the investors.

00:14:09.919 --> 00:14:13.279
Themistocles thought
otherwise.

00:14:13.279 --> 00:14:17.306
Themistocles was--it'
evident--was constantly aware of

00:14:17.306 --> 00:14:21.864
the threat from Persia and of
the importance of getting ready

00:14:21.864 --> 00:14:26.218
to fight the Persians,
and he understood I think

00:14:26.218 --> 00:14:31.926
before most other Greeks that
the navy was going to be really

00:14:31.926 --> 00:14:37.855
critical in this operation.
So, he made the suggestion that

00:14:37.855 --> 00:14:43.806
the silver strike be used to
build a whole fleet of new ships

00:14:43.806 --> 00:14:47.979
for the Athenians,
and they end up with two

00:14:47.979 --> 00:14:51.896
hundred triremes,
which is, the trireme is the

00:14:51.896 --> 00:14:55.029
battleship of the ancient
Greeks.

00:14:55.029 --> 00:15:00.492
So, that is the core of the
fleet which is the one that

00:15:00.492 --> 00:15:06.157
defeats the Persians at Salamis
and defeats them again at

00:15:06.157 --> 00:15:09.556
Mycale.
The Spartans were given command

00:15:09.556 --> 00:15:13.169
of the war against Persia,
both on land and sea,

00:15:13.169 --> 00:15:17.385
but the Spartans didn't have
any great skill or experience in

00:15:17.385 --> 00:15:20.773
naval matters,
and the Athenians had more than

00:15:20.773 --> 00:15:24.570
they, and it was the Athenian
portion of the fleet,

00:15:24.570 --> 00:15:28.895
which was the largest and the
most effective in fighting those

00:15:28.895 --> 00:15:30.928
naval battles.
And, of course,

00:15:30.928 --> 00:15:34.161
the battle of Salamis was
fought in Athenian waters and

00:15:34.161 --> 00:15:37.109
Themistocles,
with his clever devices,

00:15:37.109 --> 00:15:40.840
had come up with the way of
winning victory.

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:43.330
First of all,
compelling the Greeks to fight

00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:46.399
at Salamis and then winning the
victory at Salamis.

00:15:46.399 --> 00:15:49.246
Now, the point of all this
is one of the changes that has

00:15:49.246 --> 00:15:52.330
come upon the Greek world as a
result of this Persian invasion,

00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:57.497
is that there is something new
in the Greek world,

00:15:57.497 --> 00:16:02.137
a big Athenian navy,
and it has proven itself

00:16:02.137 --> 00:16:07.409
already to be an extraordinarily
capable navy.

00:16:07.409 --> 00:16:12.559
That is a new power factor,
and the whole idea of naval

00:16:12.559 --> 00:16:18.090
power, being very decisive in
Greek affairs is a relatively

00:16:18.090 --> 00:16:20.902
new idea.
That's not to say that there

00:16:20.902 --> 00:16:23.990
weren't states that had navies
before and naval battles,

00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:26.909
and in some cases that these
were very important.

00:16:26.909 --> 00:16:30.469
But we're really at another
level after the Athenians have

00:16:30.469 --> 00:16:33.780
built this fleet and had the
success that they had.

00:16:37.690 --> 00:16:44.557
Another consequence of the
war was of course the tremendous

00:16:44.557 --> 00:16:49.210
boom that came in Greek
self-confidence.

00:16:49.210 --> 00:16:54.610
I can't emphasize enough what
an incredible upset this was.

00:16:54.610 --> 00:16:59.071
No one would have imagined
that, if the great king got

00:16:59.071 --> 00:17:04.375
really serious and sent over an
army of a hundred or two hundred

00:17:04.375 --> 00:17:06.890
thousand,
nobody knows exactly how

00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:09.910
many--Herodotus' numbers are,
it is widely agreed,

00:17:09.910 --> 00:17:12.593
exaggerated,
but it's a very big army and a

00:17:12.593 --> 00:17:15.212
very big navy,
certainly it outnumbers the

00:17:15.212 --> 00:17:16.810
Greeks in both cases.

00:17:20.079 --> 00:17:22.510
Anybody would have thought it
was going to be an easy victory

00:17:22.510 --> 00:17:24.968
for the Persians.
To defeat that meant an

00:17:24.968 --> 00:17:29.225
enormous amount and the Greeks
came away feeling that their

00:17:29.225 --> 00:17:33.849
general prejudice over their own
superiority over everybody else

00:17:33.849 --> 00:17:38.619
had been justified by their
performance in the Persian Wars;

00:17:38.619 --> 00:17:40.971
the Athenians,
no less, of course,

00:17:40.971 --> 00:17:44.177
because of the very central
role that they had

00:17:44.177 --> 00:17:47.428
played.So,
all of these are new things

00:17:47.428 --> 00:17:51.876
that are in the hearts and minds
of the Greeks and by no means

00:17:51.876 --> 00:17:54.649
are trivial.
There was a sense that the

00:17:54.649 --> 00:17:58.720
Greeks had something remarkably
glorious, not to be forgotten,

00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:02.237
which made them proud and made
them, I think also,

00:18:02.237 --> 00:18:05.539
rather ambitious to continue in
that course.

00:18:05.539 --> 00:18:11.570
Finally, one other point that I
would want to make and that is,

00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:15.850
this is the first great
panhellenic activity,

00:18:15.850 --> 00:18:19.192
really.
There had been some sense in

00:18:19.192 --> 00:18:23.251
which the Greeks were
increasingly aware that there

00:18:23.251 --> 00:18:28.285
was something called Hellenes,
Greek peoples different from

00:18:28.285 --> 00:18:33.079
people who were not Hellenes,
and this probably took shape

00:18:33.079 --> 00:18:38.295
most fully when they competed in
the major athletic contests at

00:18:38.295 --> 00:18:43.089
major religious festivals in
which they were fundamentally

00:18:43.089 --> 00:18:47.321
Greek even though it--well,
they were entirely Greek,

00:18:47.321 --> 00:18:49.544
really.
So that would have fostered

00:18:49.544 --> 00:18:53.379
this sense of panhellenism,
but nothing could have given it

00:18:53.379 --> 00:18:57.213
the tremendous boost that it got
like this victory of these

00:18:57.213 --> 00:19:00.849
thirty-one states that had
banded together to defeat the

00:19:00.849 --> 00:19:04.653
Persians in that war.
So, panhellenism is now on

00:19:04.653 --> 00:19:07.193
the horizon.
I don't mean to say that the

00:19:07.193 --> 00:19:09.733
Greeks are shaped now into a
single people,

00:19:09.733 --> 00:19:12.878
have retreated from their
localism and their love for

00:19:12.878 --> 00:19:16.217
their polis;
nothing could be further from

00:19:16.217 --> 00:19:19.992
the truth, but alongside of
their love of autonomy and love

00:19:19.992 --> 00:19:23.434
of their polis,
there was the idea that

00:19:23.434 --> 00:19:29.272
panhellenism was a good thing.
It had a kind of a nice ring to

00:19:29.272 --> 00:19:33.175
it.
It's the sort of the thing that

00:19:33.175 --> 00:19:38.572
I feel some familiarity with.
Not that I was around right

00:19:38.572 --> 00:19:42.279
after the First World War,
but reading about it,

00:19:42.279 --> 00:19:47.068
you realize that there was some
sense after that war that the

00:19:47.068 --> 00:19:50.660
victorious peoples had something
in common,

00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:55.046
and that in any case they could
work together to achieve

00:19:55.046 --> 00:19:59.832
international peace in a way
that hadn't been thought of much

00:19:59.832 --> 00:20:02.578
before.
But even more strongly,

00:20:02.578 --> 00:20:06.071
I think the idea after the
Second World War,

00:20:06.071 --> 00:20:10.214
when this idea took even
stronger roots to the point

00:20:10.214 --> 00:20:15.170
where you know people have this
quasi-religious feeling,

00:20:15.170 --> 00:20:20.391
at least some of them do,
about the desire to avoid

00:20:20.391 --> 00:20:24.359
having parochial national
interests,

00:20:24.359 --> 00:20:28.410
determined what you're going to
do in international relations.

00:20:28.410 --> 00:20:32.620
Everything has to be done
somehow as though there were a

00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:36.474
world government that really
existed and really managed

00:20:36.474 --> 00:20:39.031
things,
and although everybody knows

00:20:39.031 --> 00:20:41.941
that's not true,
it's thought to be bad form to

00:20:41.941 --> 00:20:45.442
face that fact.
Well, something like that kind,

00:20:45.442 --> 00:20:49.252
not as bad as that,
but something like that kind of

00:20:49.252 --> 00:20:52.299
unreality was in the minds of
Greeks,

00:20:52.299 --> 00:20:55.891
because you will be hearing
over the next century various

00:20:55.891 --> 00:21:00.077
thinkers and speakers,
who want to make the case that

00:21:00.077 --> 00:21:04.050
a thing is good if it's somehow
panhellenic,

00:21:04.050 --> 00:21:08.034
that's a fine thing.
So it's an idea that's there,

00:21:08.034 --> 00:21:11.810
not that any state,
any more than our nations have

00:21:11.810 --> 00:21:15.201
given up any sovereignty or any
independence,

00:21:15.201 --> 00:21:20.613
or any autonomy.
It's an idea and that's all

00:21:20.613 --> 00:21:25.729
that it is.
Another consequence of the

00:21:25.729 --> 00:21:32.245
war was a division within the
Greek world that was in part

00:21:32.245 --> 00:21:38.761
based upon the fact that Athens
had come on in that war to

00:21:38.761 --> 00:21:45.277
become a great power and by
anybody's reckoning had played

00:21:45.277 --> 00:21:50.650
one of the leading roles in the
victory.

00:21:50.650 --> 00:21:55.348
Now, the Spartans had too;
the Spartans were the official

00:21:55.348 --> 00:21:59.904
leaders, and their regent had
been the commander at the great

00:21:59.904 --> 00:22:04.460
land battle at Plataea and their
general was in charge of the

00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:07.650
navy,
but Athens had become so

00:22:07.650 --> 00:22:12.307
important, so big,
so successful that there was

00:22:12.307 --> 00:22:16.893
now a question--I mean,
was Sparta really the leader of

00:22:16.893 --> 00:22:19.250
the Greeks?
What was the future?

00:22:19.250 --> 00:22:22.184
Was the future going to be one
in which the Spartans would

00:22:22.184 --> 00:22:25.067
maintain the unique leadership
of the Greeks or would the

00:22:25.067 --> 00:22:28.756
Athenians challenge them?
It soon became clear that

00:22:28.756 --> 00:22:31.862
the Athenians would indeed
challenge them,

00:22:31.862 --> 00:22:35.576
and so a major theme,
maybe the major theme in

00:22:35.576 --> 00:22:40.237
international relations for the
next fifty years will be the

00:22:40.237 --> 00:22:43.240
conflict between Athens and
Sparta.

00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:46.606
A lot of it,
I think, could be described

00:22:46.606 --> 00:22:50.835
really as a cold war,
because there is no fighting

00:22:50.835 --> 00:22:55.410
between the two states between
479 and about 460,

00:22:55.410 --> 00:22:58.627
or even a little bit later.
Actually, they don't come into

00:22:58.627 --> 00:23:02.694
conflict themselves until 457
again, and when that war stops

00:23:02.694 --> 00:23:05.519
there is a period once again of
peace,

00:23:05.519 --> 00:23:08.507
and then we come to the great
Peloponnesian War which

00:23:08.507 --> 00:23:10.920
dominates the last third of the
century.

00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:14.849
That's all in the future.
But what's clear now is that

00:23:14.849 --> 00:23:19.552
there's got to be some new
arrangement, some new alignment

00:23:19.552 --> 00:23:23.759
to face up to the change in the
power structure.

00:23:23.759 --> 00:23:26.519
There was only one great power
before the war;

00:23:26.519 --> 00:23:29.370
there clearly are two after the
war.

00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:36.467
Well, the Greeks also had
to decide certain questions that

00:23:36.467 --> 00:23:38.902
had been created by the war.
One of them,

00:23:38.902 --> 00:23:41.573
who is to be the leader if
there is to be a leader of the

00:23:41.573 --> 00:23:43.907
Greeks,
but beyond that there was some

00:23:43.907 --> 00:23:47.808
Greek states that had gone over
to the Persians in the course of

00:23:47.808 --> 00:23:50.862
the war.
The Greeks refer to these

00:23:50.862 --> 00:23:54.675
people as Medizers.
What should be done with the

00:23:54.675 --> 00:23:57.497
Medizers?
I'm sure there were proposals

00:23:57.497 --> 00:24:02.140
from one extreme that would have
said just wipe those cities out

00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:05.530
to the other extreme which would
have said,

00:24:05.530 --> 00:24:09.496
well, let bygones be bygones.
And there were opinions all

00:24:09.496 --> 00:24:14.303
along the middle of the way,
and so that remained an issue

00:24:14.303 --> 00:24:20.396
that had to be settled somehow.
Then behind it all was the

00:24:20.396 --> 00:24:25.559
question, what shall we look for
in the future?

00:24:25.559 --> 00:24:31.444
Was Persia going to be a threat
once again, which would imply

00:24:31.444 --> 00:24:36.475
one whole set of policies,
or can we consider the threat

00:24:36.475 --> 00:24:41.203
from Persia finished so that we
can go back to our normal way

00:24:41.203 --> 00:24:44.039
without adjusting to that
policy?

00:24:44.039 --> 00:24:48.199
For the reasons I've already
indicated the Spartans and the

00:24:48.199 --> 00:24:52.717
Peloponnesians were more likely
to take the view that the threat

00:24:52.717 --> 00:24:54.777
was over.
The Athenians,

00:24:54.777 --> 00:24:57.192
the islanders,
and the Ionians,

00:24:57.192 --> 00:25:00.089
I should said the Asiatic
Greeks,

00:25:00.089 --> 00:25:05.482
would take the view that no,
there is a very imminent danger

00:25:05.482 --> 00:25:09.213
from the Persians,
the war isn't over,

00:25:09.213 --> 00:25:12.519
we need to continue to fight
it.

00:25:12.519 --> 00:25:18.334
Now, let me then try to
describe the way in which a new

00:25:18.334 --> 00:25:24.450
way of dealing with the Persians
would come onto the scene.

00:25:24.450 --> 00:25:29.569
For that I need to take you
back to 481, the year when

00:25:29.569 --> 00:25:35.267
Xerxes started his march from
the Persian empire against the

00:25:35.267 --> 00:25:38.094
Greeks.
The Greeks knew this was

00:25:38.094 --> 00:25:41.109
happening and they met,
you will remember,

00:25:41.109 --> 00:25:45.446
at Corinth in 481 when those
thirty one cities came together

00:25:45.446 --> 00:25:50.519
and swore that they would fight
together to defeat the Persians.

00:25:50.519 --> 00:25:54.213
They appointed Sparta
officially as the

00:25:54.213 --> 00:25:58.490
hegemon,
the leader of that league,

00:25:58.490 --> 00:26:02.744
which meant that the Spartans
would be in command on land and

00:26:02.744 --> 00:26:06.289
sea and once the battles
commenced they would be in

00:26:06.289 --> 00:26:08.308
charge.
But, of course,

00:26:08.308 --> 00:26:12.601
the decisions as to what to do,
where to go to fight,

00:26:12.601 --> 00:26:16.585
when to fight and so on,
were made by the council of

00:26:16.585 --> 00:26:20.438
Greeks who were participating.
The Spartans did not

00:26:20.438 --> 00:26:23.809
attempt to impose their wishes
at that point,

00:26:23.809 --> 00:26:28.329
So, the league really functions
like a league of equals,

00:26:28.329 --> 00:26:30.713
but of course,
the states are not equal in

00:26:30.713 --> 00:26:34.549
their power so that there's much
more influence by the Spartans,

00:26:34.549 --> 00:26:37.377
but there's also a lot of
influence by the Athenians,

00:26:37.377 --> 00:26:39.390
because of the size of their
fleet.

00:26:39.390 --> 00:26:43.039
That's the way things were
working in the Greek League

00:26:43.039 --> 00:26:45.872
against Persia.
Even though the Spartans are

00:26:45.872 --> 00:26:48.840
the hegemon,
they do not confuse this league

00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:53.250
with the Peloponnesian League.
It is something quite different.

00:26:53.250 --> 00:26:56.168
I've already described the
league to you and so you know

00:26:56.168 --> 00:26:59.247
that the relationships are
different, and the membership is

00:26:59.247 --> 00:27:01.587
different.
The Greek League has states

00:27:01.587 --> 00:27:05.136
that are not in the Peloponnesus
and have not previously been

00:27:05.136 --> 00:27:08.358
allied to Sparta;
it also includes Sparta's

00:27:08.358 --> 00:27:11.130
traditional Peloponnesian
allies.

00:27:11.130 --> 00:27:16.759
They swear this common oath;
the Greeks are to fight for the

00:27:16.759 --> 00:27:20.655
common freedom,
to free the Greeks in the

00:27:20.655 --> 00:27:26.957
islands in Asia Minor.
And it is to be a perpetual

00:27:26.957 --> 00:27:32.974
league, as we know,
because as late as 461,

00:27:32.974 --> 00:27:36.326
I guess,
when there is a conflict

00:27:36.326 --> 00:27:39.286
between Athens and Sparta,
the Athenians,

00:27:39.286 --> 00:27:42.913
in fact,
withdraw from their alliance

00:27:42.913 --> 00:27:46.529
with the Greeks under Spartan
rule.

00:27:46.529 --> 00:27:50.564
So, that tells us that until
then they felt themselves still

00:27:50.564 --> 00:27:55.377
to be part of that Greek League.
They agreed in 481 to put aside

00:27:55.377 --> 00:27:59.309
the quarrels that they may have
had at the time,

00:27:59.309 --> 00:28:04.072
and to have the same friends
and enemies, the famous clause

00:28:04.072 --> 00:28:07.109
that means a common foreign
policy.

00:28:07.109 --> 00:28:09.124
But it doesn't mean,
again--just because the

00:28:09.124 --> 00:28:11.841
Spartans are hegemons
doesn't mean the Spartans will

00:28:11.841 --> 00:28:14.867
determine that policy.
The policy will be determined

00:28:14.867 --> 00:28:17.049
by the league in its own
meetings.

00:28:17.049 --> 00:28:21.940
It is to be a typical Greek
alliance.

00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:25.630
The Greek word for that is
symmachia;

00:28:25.630 --> 00:28:29.410
it means an offensive and
defensive alliance.

00:28:29.410 --> 00:28:33.239
I will fight along your side,
not only if you are attacked,

00:28:33.239 --> 00:28:36.739
but if you go to war against
somebody else at your own

00:28:36.739 --> 00:28:39.767
discretion,
I still am bound to be your

00:28:39.767 --> 00:28:41.552
ally;
that's what a symmachia

00:28:41.552 --> 00:28:42.881
is.
So far as we know,

00:28:42.881 --> 00:28:46.336
that's the only kind of
international alliance that the

00:28:46.336 --> 00:28:49.920
Greeks knew up to that time,
offensive and defensive.

00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:55.387
Nothing is said about money;
there is no provision for

00:28:55.387 --> 00:29:00.932
providing funds for the league.
I think that implies very

00:29:00.932 --> 00:29:06.599
clearly each state would pay for
its own forces when they were

00:29:06.599 --> 00:29:10.862
engaged in the common cause.
There was no provision for

00:29:10.862 --> 00:29:13.487
regular meetings;
meetings would be held when

00:29:13.487 --> 00:29:15.650
they were thought to be
necessary.

00:29:15.650 --> 00:29:21.114
Of course, everything would
have to be done by the common

00:29:21.114 --> 00:29:24.232
consent.
I don't mean that there was a

00:29:24.232 --> 00:29:27.853
need for unanimity,
but there certainly would have

00:29:27.853 --> 00:29:31.769
to be a general agreement of
things for the game to go

00:29:31.769 --> 00:29:34.670
forward.
This is a new thing.

00:29:34.670 --> 00:29:37.918
It's an innovation,
and of course it fits in nicely

00:29:37.918 --> 00:29:41.101
with what I said a moment ago
about the concept of

00:29:41.101 --> 00:29:47.035
panhellenism coming forward.
This is the first Pan Hellenic

00:29:47.035 --> 00:29:52.690
expedition, I suppose since the
Trojan War.

00:29:52.690 --> 00:29:55.216
Now Sparta,
as you've seen,

00:29:55.216 --> 00:30:00.015
when the decision had to be
made as to whether they should

00:30:00.015 --> 00:30:04.899
commit themselves to defending
the islands with a kind of a

00:30:04.899 --> 00:30:08.520
permanent force out there to do
that,

00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:12.490
the Spartans withdrew.
Nothing is formal;

00:30:12.490 --> 00:30:14.242
there's no change in the
arrangements,

00:30:14.242 --> 00:30:15.900
but they just decided to go
home.

00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:19.943
Now we see that the Athenians
will be pursuing a different

00:30:19.943 --> 00:30:23.845
policy -- the one that was
ultimately adopted by most of

00:30:23.845 --> 00:30:27.058
the Greeks,
but which allowed the Athenians

00:30:27.058 --> 00:30:30.730
to come forward and make the
kinds of claims for their

00:30:30.730 --> 00:30:34.663
influence that they would.
One of the first things the

00:30:34.663 --> 00:30:37.513
Athenians wanted to do,
and I remind you,

00:30:37.513 --> 00:30:40.720
that the Persians had marched
into Attica,

00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:47.541
and done fearful damage to the
polis of Athens and had

00:30:47.541 --> 00:30:52.089
done great harm to the city of
Athens.

00:30:52.089 --> 00:30:55.122
They had gone up to the
Acropolis, destroyed the temples

00:30:55.122 --> 00:30:58.193
that existed there,
a terrible sacrilege from the

00:30:58.193 --> 00:31:02.284
point of view of the Athenians,
and they wanted to do what they

00:31:02.284 --> 00:31:05.319
could to see this would never
happen again.

00:31:05.319 --> 00:31:13.763
So, they undertook to build
the walls around the Acropolis

00:31:13.763 --> 00:31:21.930
stronger than they had been,
and also to make the city walls

00:31:21.930 --> 00:31:28.790
stronger than they had been.
Now, it's an interesting sign

00:31:28.790 --> 00:31:33.734
of the way some of the other
Greek states felt that when the

00:31:33.734 --> 00:31:37.923
Athenians set about building
their walls there were

00:31:37.923 --> 00:31:42.532
complaints from some of the
Greek allies to the Spartans

00:31:42.532 --> 00:31:47.476
that the Athenians were doing
this and saying this was a bad

00:31:47.476 --> 00:31:50.540
idea.
My guess is that the

00:31:50.540 --> 00:31:55.643
complainants would have included
such cities as Thebes,

00:31:55.643 --> 00:32:00.580
Megara, probably Corinth;
Thebes and Megara being both

00:32:00.580 --> 00:32:05.817
neighbors abutting on Attica and
old enemies of the Athenians and

00:32:05.817 --> 00:32:09.089
the Corinthians being just next
door,

00:32:09.089 --> 00:32:12.296
so to speak,
not quite on their border but

00:32:12.296 --> 00:32:16.206
also a state that was
undoubtedly challenged by the

00:32:16.206 --> 00:32:20.351
emergence of Athens as a great
naval power and a great

00:32:20.351 --> 00:32:24.182
commercial power.
Corinth had had one of the

00:32:24.182 --> 00:32:26.012
biggest navies,
and Corinth,

00:32:26.012 --> 00:32:29.264
for the longest time,
had been a great commercial

00:32:29.264 --> 00:32:32.257
power.
The archaeological evidence is

00:32:32.257 --> 00:32:36.453
that it was being challenged in
the latter respect by the

00:32:36.453 --> 00:32:39.900
Athenians as early as in the
sixth century.

00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:43.027
So, these are the kind of
states that would have been

00:32:43.027 --> 00:32:46.816
complaining and thinking that if
the Athenians had a walled city

00:32:46.816 --> 00:32:50.475
that they could defend,
it would make them more

00:32:50.475 --> 00:32:55.608
confident and possibly more
aggressive and more trouble for

00:32:55.608 --> 00:33:00.769
their neighbors.
In the war, the Athenians had

00:33:00.769 --> 00:33:06.650
shown an astonishing,
daring, especially at sea,

00:33:06.650 --> 00:33:11.812
which obviously was making some
of their old enemies and

00:33:11.812 --> 00:33:17.143
neighbors nervous.
Well, the Spartans heard

00:33:17.143 --> 00:33:24.420
about it, and they heeded their
friends complaints enough,

00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:28.867
so that Themistocles who was--I
need to point out to you,

00:33:28.867 --> 00:33:33.763
though I'm sure you know it,
emerged from the war as the

00:33:33.763 --> 00:33:37.317
great hero.
He had done so many wonderful

00:33:37.317 --> 00:33:39.762
things.
He was responsible for the

00:33:39.762 --> 00:33:42.488
Athenian navy,
he was responsible for the

00:33:42.488 --> 00:33:45.677
decision to fight at Salamis,
he was responsible,

00:33:45.677 --> 00:33:48.009
people believe,
for the victory at Salamis.

00:33:48.009 --> 00:33:52.307
We hear as Plutarch tells
wonderful stories about in the

00:33:52.307 --> 00:33:55.119
Olympic games right after the
war,

00:33:55.119 --> 00:33:58.157
people were watching the games
when Themistocles arrived,

00:33:58.157 --> 00:34:01.630
they stopped watching the games
and they watched Themistocles,

00:34:01.630 --> 00:34:07.527
because so great was the
admiration and wonder that he

00:34:07.527 --> 00:34:10.090
created.
I always try to figure out some

00:34:10.090 --> 00:34:13.115
analogy now but I can't.
If you imagine if you could

00:34:13.115 --> 00:34:16.413
wrap up Roosevelt,
Churchill, and Stalin and make

00:34:16.413 --> 00:34:19.917
him one person after Second
World War you might have

00:34:19.917 --> 00:34:24.618
something like Themistocles did.
So, Themistocles goes to

00:34:24.618 --> 00:34:28.165
Sparta, and he,
of course, is the main champion

00:34:28.165 --> 00:34:33.099
in Athens of Athens rebuilding
its walls as fast as possible,

00:34:33.099 --> 00:34:37.236
and Athens taking the most
forward position possible in the

00:34:37.236 --> 00:34:41.230
navy at sea and in international
relations in general.

00:34:41.230 --> 00:34:45.260
He does this little trick that
Thucydides describes.

00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:50.628
He says, he will go to Sparta,
but the Spartans are to send

00:34:50.628 --> 00:34:55.134
some people to Athens too,
and then he tells the Athenians

00:34:55.134 --> 00:34:58.159
to hold those Spartans there
until he gets home.

00:34:58.159 --> 00:35:03.128
The next thing he says is,
let me know when the walls have

00:35:03.128 --> 00:35:06.179
been built high enough to
defend.

00:35:06.179 --> 00:35:09.093
So, he goes to talk to the
Spartans, the Spartans says we

00:35:09.093 --> 00:35:11.590
hear you guys are building walls
around there.

00:35:11.590 --> 00:35:14.147
You know, I know it's your own
business but we don't think

00:35:14.147 --> 00:35:17.008
that's a good idea,
because if the Persians come

00:35:17.008 --> 00:35:21.119
again they could use your walled
city as a base against us.

00:35:21.119 --> 00:35:25.121
Now, if you can follow that
kind of reasoning you're sharper

00:35:25.121 --> 00:35:28.579
than I am, but anyway that's the
story they told.

00:35:28.579 --> 00:35:31.090
Themistocles says where did
you hear that nonsense;

00:35:31.090 --> 00:35:34.100
we're building walls?
What a lot of baloney;

00:35:34.100 --> 00:35:36.219
forget about it.
I'm sorry.

00:35:36.219 --> 00:35:37.409
I haven't told the story quite
right.

00:35:37.409 --> 00:35:40.251
He says, look don't take my
word for it, you send an embassy

00:35:40.251 --> 00:35:43.232
to Athens and take a look;
that's when he told his friends

00:35:43.232 --> 00:35:45.340
keep those guys there until I
get home.

00:35:45.340 --> 00:35:49.567
So one day, a messenger from
Athens comes to Themistocles and

00:35:49.567 --> 00:35:52.949
tells him, okay the walls can
now be defended,

00:35:52.949 --> 00:35:55.030
whereupon Themistocles says to
the Spartans,

00:35:55.030 --> 00:35:57.450
you know those walls you were
complaining about,

00:35:57.450 --> 00:36:00.815
you were right;
we do have them and they're now

00:36:00.815 --> 00:36:03.960
big enough that we can defend
ourselves against them,

00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:06.440
and what are you going to do
about it?

00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:10.621
Then he delivers a speech,
which is a kind of a

00:36:10.621 --> 00:36:15.387
declaration, not so much of
independence as of equivalence

00:36:15.387 --> 00:36:18.179
to the Spartans.
His message was,

00:36:18.179 --> 00:36:22.399
we don't take orders from you;
keep your advice to yourself,

00:36:22.399 --> 00:36:26.570
we'll take care of ourselves,
you take care of yourselves.

00:36:26.570 --> 00:36:31.198
You are not our superiors.
We are your equals was the

00:36:31.198 --> 00:36:34.961
essence of what he said.
Thereafter, Themistocles was

00:36:34.961 --> 00:36:37.420
not so popular in Sparta as he
used to be.

00:36:37.420 --> 00:36:41.469
Indeed, for the rest of his
life the Spartans will be trying

00:36:41.469 --> 00:36:44.489
to do him harm and remove him
from the scene,

00:36:44.489 --> 00:36:47.510
but he certainly achieves what
he wants.

00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:51.654
The Athenians are a walled
city, and they have declared

00:36:51.654 --> 00:36:55.800
that whatever their formal,
technical relationship with

00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:58.716
Sparta might be under the
Hellenic League,

00:36:58.716 --> 00:37:02.344
the fact is they are
independent players and they're

00:37:02.344 --> 00:37:05.190
going to do things as they see
fit.

00:37:05.190 --> 00:37:09.890
Thucydides says the
Spartans accepted this,

00:37:09.890 --> 00:37:13.570
but secretly they were
embittered.

00:37:13.570 --> 00:37:17.971
I think that's the first clue
we have to what will become a

00:37:17.971 --> 00:37:22.600
continuing situation in Sparta
for the rest of the time we pay

00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:26.734
attention to them.
That there will be a factional

00:37:26.734 --> 00:37:31.170
division among Spartans,
at least, this much is true.

00:37:31.170 --> 00:37:34.762
I'm sure it's much more
complicated than we know,

00:37:34.762 --> 00:37:38.953
but in the simplest way there
were some Spartans who were

00:37:38.953 --> 00:37:43.592
content to withdraw back to the
Peloponnesus to have nothing to

00:37:43.592 --> 00:37:47.260
do with the world outside the
Peloponnesus,

00:37:47.260 --> 00:37:51.125
much less with the world of the
Aegean Sea and beyond,

00:37:51.125 --> 00:37:54.480
and try to return to their
traditional ways,

00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:59.500
a peace faction if you will,
a conservative faction perhaps.

00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:04.466
But that there is also starting
now as a result of the victory

00:38:04.466 --> 00:38:08.618
in the war, a faction of
Spartans that would like to

00:38:08.618 --> 00:38:12.769
exert Spartan power and
influence more broadly,

00:38:12.769 --> 00:38:17.009
at least to include the rest of
the Greek states of the

00:38:17.009 --> 00:38:21.405
mainland, but also a number of
them surely felt that they

00:38:21.405 --> 00:38:24.310
wanted to exert power
everywhere,

00:38:24.310 --> 00:38:29.261
including overseas as well.
But that faction,

00:38:29.261 --> 00:38:32.889
that second faction doesn't win
the argument.

00:38:32.889 --> 00:38:36.771
They have to be secretly
embittered, because the official

00:38:36.771 --> 00:38:40.329
policy of Sparta is to accept
the Athenian situation,

00:38:40.329 --> 00:38:44.017
and we'll see in a moment that
events move them in the same

00:38:44.017 --> 00:38:46.898
direction.
The commander of the Spartan

00:38:46.898 --> 00:38:50.226
forces at Plataea,
who emerges as the leading

00:38:50.226 --> 00:38:52.949
figure immediately after the
war,

00:38:52.949 --> 00:38:56.888
is Pausanias,
who was the regent,

00:38:56.888 --> 00:39:02.920
but effectively one of the two
kings of Sparta.

00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:07.566
He goes out to the Aegean
Sea--remember the previous king

00:39:07.566 --> 00:39:12.042
and commander had retired,
but now Pausanias takes the

00:39:12.042 --> 00:39:16.426
fleet and he goes out there,
and he proceeds to make the

00:39:16.426 --> 00:39:19.232
Greeks--first of all,
he proceeds to be very

00:39:19.232 --> 00:39:22.418
effective against the Persians.
He does some fighting,

00:39:22.418 --> 00:39:27.570
particularly in the Hellespont,
and the straits in general.

00:39:27.570 --> 00:39:31.781
Byzantium is a very important
city there, what later becomes

00:39:31.781 --> 00:39:35.493
Constantinople and then
Istanbul, and the little town

00:39:35.493 --> 00:39:39.216
across the way.
So, they control the straits,

00:39:39.216 --> 00:39:44.194
he defeats the Persians and so
on, but in the process he makes

00:39:44.194 --> 00:39:48.743
enemies among the Greeks.
Part of the reason is

00:39:48.743 --> 00:39:53.903
because he treats the Greeks as
inferiors, as if they were

00:39:53.903 --> 00:39:59.108
underlings of the Spartans.
In general, it appears to have

00:39:59.108 --> 00:40:03.671
been a common Spartan problem
that when they went out of

00:40:03.671 --> 00:40:08.400
Sparta and had commanding
positions over other Greeks,

00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:12.750
they regularly treated them in
that way--different degrees,

00:40:12.750 --> 00:40:15.515
of course.
Pausanias must have been

00:40:15.515 --> 00:40:19.556
particularly annoying,
but there were main complaints

00:40:19.556 --> 00:40:23.519
about how they were treated by
his Greek allies.

00:40:23.519 --> 00:40:28.846
In addition,
he became very much caught up

00:40:28.846 --> 00:40:37.159
in the great wealth and luxury
that the Persians demonstrated.

00:40:37.159 --> 00:40:40.842
Most Greeks were,
at least theoretically,

00:40:40.842 --> 00:40:45.905
very appalled at the morals or
the lack of morals of the

00:40:45.905 --> 00:40:50.824
Persians from their perspective.
But the Persians were,

00:40:50.824 --> 00:40:53.887
first of all,
very rich and the Greeks were

00:40:53.887 --> 00:40:58.117
not, and they used their wealth
for various purposes all of

00:40:58.117 --> 00:41:01.909
which were seen to be ungreek
and unattractive.

00:41:01.909 --> 00:41:06.340
Pausanias fell for it and
he began behaving as though he

00:41:06.340 --> 00:41:10.019
were a Persian satrap at
the very least.

00:41:10.019 --> 00:41:12.503
All of these things,
as I say, irritated their

00:41:12.503 --> 00:41:15.539
fellow Greeks who began to bring
charges against him.

00:41:15.539 --> 00:41:19.287
He was charged in Sparta with,
first of all,

00:41:19.287 --> 00:41:22.860
tyranny and then second of all
treason.

00:41:22.860 --> 00:41:28.382
He was alleged to have cut some
kind of a deal with the Persian

00:41:28.382 --> 00:41:33.369
ruler and his satraps
against the common cause.

00:41:33.369 --> 00:41:37.246
This was effective enough to
have him recalled and put on

00:41:37.246 --> 00:41:40.369
trial.
He was acquitted.

00:41:40.369 --> 00:41:44.538
On the other hand,
he was not sent out again to be

00:41:44.538 --> 00:41:47.929
the commander;
he was put on the side.

00:41:47.929 --> 00:41:52.119
Later on further charges would
be brought against him and he

00:41:52.119 --> 00:41:56.099
would indeed be put to death.
Okay, but the main point is

00:41:56.099 --> 00:41:59.264
that the Spartans have withdrawn
their commander,

00:41:59.264 --> 00:42:02.890
pretty much in disgrace with
the rest of the Greeks.

00:42:02.890 --> 00:42:07.590
They send out a replacement.
A man called Dorcis.

00:42:07.590 --> 00:42:11.629
The allies don't accept him,
and they say no we're not

00:42:11.629 --> 00:42:15.974
taking any Spartan commanders
these days and send him back

00:42:15.974 --> 00:42:20.510
home.
That is an extremely important

00:42:20.510 --> 00:42:24.294
step.
The allies, and that means now,

00:42:24.294 --> 00:42:29.059
the people in the Aegean Sea
and on its borders,

00:42:29.059 --> 00:42:33.225
the people who are in what will
be first the Athenian sphere of

00:42:33.225 --> 00:42:35.980
influence and then the Athenian
Empire,

00:42:35.980 --> 00:42:39.909
these are the states that don't
want Spartan rule.

00:42:39.909 --> 00:42:42.325
I think the main reason
is--well, there's a couple of

00:42:42.325 --> 00:42:44.325
reasons.
One is the behavior of

00:42:44.325 --> 00:42:47.870
Pausanias has discredited the
Spartans, but the other I think

00:42:47.870 --> 00:42:50.702
is this.
Look, how much evidence do you

00:42:50.702 --> 00:42:55.139
need that the Spartans really
don't like this kind of thing?

00:42:55.139 --> 00:42:58.054
Remember, they had voted
against taking those three

00:42:58.054 --> 00:43:00.909
islands into the league even
back there in 479.

00:43:00.909 --> 00:43:04.574
And the other thing is that,
here are the Athenians,

00:43:04.574 --> 00:43:07.519
the guys who really won the war
at sea,

00:43:07.519 --> 00:43:10.846
which is the one you're
concerned about and who are

00:43:10.846 --> 00:43:14.440
apparently ready and waiting to
continue to do that.

00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:18.201
And it was I think that choice
that was in the minds of the

00:43:18.201 --> 00:43:21.119
allies when they sent Dorcis
home and said,

00:43:21.119 --> 00:43:24.916
please no more,
and the Spartans did not send a

00:43:24.916 --> 00:43:28.923
replacement for Dorcis.
They, in other words,

00:43:28.923 --> 00:43:33.043
accepted that they would not
participate in the future

00:43:33.043 --> 00:43:37.021
campaigns against Persia,
which would be obviously

00:43:37.021 --> 00:43:41.226
aggressive campaigns in Asia,
since the Persians had been

00:43:41.226 --> 00:43:44.980
driven out of Europe and out of
the Aegean Sea.

00:43:44.980 --> 00:43:49.760
Thucydides says this about the
Spartan decision.

00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:54.454
They also wanted to be rid of
the Persian War,

00:43:54.454 --> 00:44:00.400
and believed that the Athenians
were competent to lead,

00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:05.470
and were at the present time,
well disposed to the Spartans.

00:44:05.470 --> 00:44:09.059
Why not, they said.
We don't want to fight this war;

00:44:09.059 --> 00:44:11.502
we don't really care about
those things,

00:44:11.502 --> 00:44:15.196
and everything will be okay,
because the Athenians can do it

00:44:15.196 --> 00:44:19.429
and they're our friends.
But surely that was not all

00:44:19.429 --> 00:44:23.989
what all the Spartans thought,
that was the opinion of the

00:44:23.989 --> 00:44:28.745
faction that won the argument,
which was the conservative

00:44:28.745 --> 00:44:33.465
faction, the one that was the
peace party and let's stay in

00:44:33.465 --> 00:44:38.510
the Peloponnesus party--it was
still the predominant force,

00:44:38.510 --> 00:44:42.729
and I suspect their position
had been strengthened by the

00:44:42.729 --> 00:44:47.250
disgrace brought upon Sparta by
the behavior of Pausanias,

00:44:47.250 --> 00:44:51.935
and no doubt by the rejection
of the Spartan replacement by

00:44:51.935 --> 00:44:54.929
the other Greeks.
Why should we force ourselves?

00:44:54.929 --> 00:44:58.599
We are making ourselves
unpopular.

00:44:58.599 --> 00:45:02.135
It used to be the Greeks came
to us and begged us to fight and

00:45:02.135 --> 00:45:04.685
protect them,
when they're in trouble and now

00:45:04.685 --> 00:45:06.829
they're rejecting our
leadership.

00:45:06.829 --> 00:45:08.989
That's because we shouldn't be
out there.

00:45:08.989 --> 00:45:12.260
This is not our kind of a
campaign.

00:45:12.260 --> 00:45:17.539
Well, one can go on and imagine
the arguments that were used.

00:45:17.539 --> 00:45:22.428
Now, did this mean that
there would be no continuing

00:45:22.428 --> 00:45:26.019
campaign against Persia?
Certainly not;

00:45:26.019 --> 00:45:28.670
that is not what the allies
meant.

00:45:28.670 --> 00:45:33.606
They turned to Athens and asked
the Athenians to take the lead

00:45:33.606 --> 00:45:36.519
in the war that was going to
come.

00:45:36.519 --> 00:45:42.998
Herodotus has a line in which
he says, the Athenians offered

00:45:42.998 --> 00:45:49.807
the hubris of Pausanias
as a pretext for taking over the

00:45:49.807 --> 00:45:54.090
leadership of the Greeks out
there.

00:45:54.090 --> 00:45:57.969
That suggests that the
Athenians were planning to do

00:45:57.969 --> 00:46:02.458
just that, that they very much
wanted too and that they were

00:46:02.458 --> 00:46:05.730
engaged in maneuvers to bring it
about;

00:46:05.730 --> 00:46:08.720
that it was their idea that
they took the initiative.

00:46:12.830 --> 00:46:16.800
But I think that's not right.
Let me back up a step;

00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:20.077
it's only partly right.
What is certainly clear is that

00:46:20.077 --> 00:46:23.215
the Athenians were ready and
willing to do what they were

00:46:23.215 --> 00:46:25.913
asked,
but the idea that they either

00:46:25.913 --> 00:46:30.299
used their power and influence,
or their wiles to bring the

00:46:30.299 --> 00:46:33.898
allies to take that decision,
when they would not have

00:46:33.898 --> 00:46:35.960
otherwise done so,
I think that is wrong.

00:46:35.960 --> 00:46:39.844
I'm going to start doing
something that you may get tired

00:46:39.844 --> 00:46:43.250
of after awhile;
I want to use an analogy that I

00:46:43.250 --> 00:46:48.481
find very illuminating anyway.
The analogy of the formation of

00:46:48.481 --> 00:46:54.464
NATO after the Second World War
and the formation of the Delian

00:46:54.464 --> 00:46:58.385
League,
which is ultimately turned into

00:46:58.385 --> 00:47:02.579
the Athenian Empire after the
Persian Wars.

00:47:02.579 --> 00:47:08.656
In the case of the Delian
League, I think a Norwegian or a

00:47:08.656 --> 00:47:14.733
Swedish scholar has described
the process whereby NATO was

00:47:14.733 --> 00:47:21.130
invented as the establishment of
hegemony by invitation.

00:47:21.130 --> 00:47:24.635
That is, if you look at the
situation in 1945,1946,

00:47:24.635 --> 00:47:28.491
1947,1948, and 1949 the
Europeans states that ultimately

00:47:28.491 --> 00:47:32.628
became part of NATO desperately
wanted the Americans to join

00:47:32.628 --> 00:47:35.711
with them,
not to repeat what they had

00:47:35.711 --> 00:47:40.144
done after the First World War,
which was to retreat back into

00:47:40.144 --> 00:47:43.240
North America,
to have no connections of a

00:47:43.240 --> 00:47:47.030
political military kind with
Europe, which terrified the

00:47:47.030 --> 00:47:51.164
European states that were sort
of knocked down so hard by the

00:47:51.164 --> 00:47:55.368
Second World War and who were
afraid that the Soviet Union was

00:47:55.368 --> 00:47:59.778
going to take them over and they
desperately wanted the Americans

00:47:59.778 --> 00:48:03.472
to take the lead.
Now, the Americans were

00:48:03.472 --> 00:48:06.501
glad to do it.
I don't mean all the Americans,

00:48:06.501 --> 00:48:10.381
as always, there were factions
and differences of opinions and

00:48:10.381 --> 00:48:14.261
the American President and his
government had to fight hard to

00:48:14.261 --> 00:48:18.283
convince Americans to do it,
but by and large they did and

00:48:18.283 --> 00:48:22.197
those who won the argument were
of the opinion that American

00:48:22.197 --> 00:48:24.183
interests,
first of all,

00:48:24.183 --> 00:48:28.074
in restoring Europe to its
previous condition,

00:48:28.074 --> 00:48:31.099
and secondly,
to resisting communist

00:48:31.099 --> 00:48:34.181
takeover,
Soviet takeover of Europe,

00:48:34.181 --> 00:48:38.284
meant that it was in America's
interest to see that such a

00:48:38.284 --> 00:48:41.956
situation developed.
Both sides, I would argue,

00:48:41.956 --> 00:48:46.533
were equally glad to see what
happened because it was in the

00:48:46.533 --> 00:48:51.959
interest of both sides.
So I think it was in 478-7

00:48:51.959 --> 00:48:57.869
when the formation of the Delian
League took place.

00:48:57.869 --> 00:49:03.032
Obviously, the states that were
bordering on the Persian Empire

00:49:03.032 --> 00:49:07.862
and in the seas next to Asia
Minor were absolutely at risk,

00:49:07.862 --> 00:49:12.008
if the Persians came back.
Supposing the Athenians had

00:49:12.008 --> 00:49:14.694
said, we're not interested and
had gone home,

00:49:14.694 --> 00:49:18.358
just as the Persians had--there
was no Greek force except for

00:49:18.358 --> 00:49:21.594
the poor Asiatic Greeks
themselves to resist a Persian

00:49:21.594 --> 00:49:24.829
return and they couldn't
possibly resist that.

00:49:24.829 --> 00:49:27.409
So for them,
it was a life and death matter,

00:49:27.409 --> 00:49:30.949
at least it was a matter of
freedom versus slavery that they

00:49:30.949 --> 00:49:34.010
should persuade the Athenians to
take the lead.

00:49:34.010 --> 00:49:37.003
But for the Athenians,
who won the argument,

00:49:37.003 --> 00:49:39.579
it was obvious they felt our
needs,

00:49:39.579 --> 00:49:43.737
for instance access to the
Black Sea, our feelings,

00:49:43.737 --> 00:49:47.230
friendship for the Greeks of
Asia Minor,

00:49:47.230 --> 00:49:50.288
and our fear,
fear of what the Persians might

00:49:50.288 --> 00:49:54.179
do if they got rolling--all
point to the same outcome,

00:49:54.179 --> 00:49:59.884
and so I think both sides were
equally glad to undertake this

00:49:59.884 --> 00:50:02.998
new path.
I think we would be deeply

00:50:02.998 --> 00:50:06.792
mistaken, if we imagine that
anybody imposed his will on

00:50:06.792 --> 00:50:08.930
anybody else in this matter.

00:50:12.179 --> 00:50:16.158
In fact, the Athenians,
according to Plutarch's story,

00:50:16.158 --> 00:50:19.343
needed persuasion.
Plutarch tells the tale of

00:50:19.343 --> 00:50:23.226
Aristides, who was in command of
the Athenian fleet there off

00:50:23.226 --> 00:50:26.067
Asia Minor at the time.
When the Samians,

00:50:26.067 --> 00:50:30.015
particularly took the lead and
came to the Athenians and to

00:50:30.015 --> 00:50:32.875
Aristides and said,
won't you please be our

00:50:32.875 --> 00:50:35.321
leaders?
Aristides said,

00:50:35.321 --> 00:50:40.421
before we do that,
you show us that you are really

00:50:40.421 --> 00:50:45.001
committed to us,
and that you will not simply

00:50:45.001 --> 00:50:48.710
use us.
I'm putting in stuff that's not

00:50:48.710 --> 00:50:51.901
in Plutarch now.
Don't use us as a kind of a way

00:50:51.901 --> 00:50:55.345
of convincing the Spartans to
stay and then leave us in the

00:50:55.345 --> 00:50:58.216
lurch.
So Uliades, the commander of

00:50:58.216 --> 00:51:01.387
the Samian navy,
turned, took his ship,

00:51:01.387 --> 00:51:05.309
sailed it against the flagship
of Pausanias,

00:51:05.309 --> 00:51:09.103
this is at the time when
Pausanias is still around,

00:51:09.103 --> 00:51:12.762
and rams that ship.Well,
that ought to take care of any

00:51:12.762 --> 00:51:15.019
possibility of playing footsy
with the Spartans,

00:51:15.019 --> 00:51:18.666
at which point,
the Athenians accept the

00:51:18.666 --> 00:51:24.650
leadership and then move forward
with the plan for doing that.

00:51:24.650 --> 00:51:28.893
So in the winter of 478-7,
there is a meeting of the

00:51:28.893 --> 00:51:33.219
Greeks who are interested,
at the Island of Delos.

00:51:33.219 --> 00:51:38.135
Delos is right smack in the
middle of the Aegean Sea,

00:51:38.135 --> 00:51:42.957
and as I've told you,
it is the birthplace of Apollo

00:51:42.957 --> 00:51:46.028
and Artemis,
and Apollo, of course,

00:51:46.028 --> 00:51:50.138
has got a special fondness for
the Ionians, and so it's the

00:51:50.138 --> 00:51:52.690
natural place for this to
happen,

00:51:52.690 --> 00:51:55.909
and they come up with what
amount--it is essentially a

00:51:55.909 --> 00:51:58.813
constitutional convention.
They come up with a

00:51:58.813 --> 00:52:02.550
constitution that will describe
how the league is to work.

00:52:02.550 --> 00:52:08.001
The aims of the league are
that the members of the league

00:52:08.001 --> 00:52:12.174
will fight against the Persians,
first of all,

00:52:12.174 --> 00:52:15.929
to avenge what the Persians did
to the Greeks,

00:52:15.929 --> 00:52:19.100
and secondly,
to collect booty from the

00:52:19.100 --> 00:52:23.940
Persians to pay for the damage
that the Persians did.

00:52:23.940 --> 00:52:29.200
So, that is a part of the story.
I think, of course,

00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:34.481
implicit, it didn't have to be
said, that the primary motive

00:52:34.481 --> 00:52:38.787
must be to maintain,
establish I would guess,

00:52:38.787 --> 00:52:44.219
and maintain the freedom of the
Greeks from Persian rule.

00:52:44.219 --> 00:52:47.068
Thucydides doesn't mention that
and some scholars have been

00:52:47.068 --> 00:52:49.818
misled into thinking that
somehow that wasn't part of the

00:52:49.818 --> 00:52:51.621
story.
Well, how could they do the

00:52:51.621 --> 00:52:53.369
rest of it, if they didn't do
that?

00:52:53.369 --> 00:52:57.333
These states were obviously in
danger of being taken by the

00:52:57.333 --> 00:53:01.364
Persians, so the maintenance of
their freedom had to be step

00:53:01.364 --> 00:53:05.736
number one,
and surely that was clear in

00:53:05.736 --> 00:53:08.464
their minds.
They agreed,

00:53:08.464 --> 00:53:11.987
as it was typical,
in Greek alliances to have the

00:53:11.987 --> 00:53:15.730
same friends and enemies,
common foreign policy.

00:53:15.730 --> 00:53:20.340
To carry this forward,
they all swore oaths;

00:53:20.340 --> 00:53:23.250
that's their form of signing
treaties.

00:53:23.250 --> 00:53:26.969
They don't sign treaties they
swear oaths.

00:53:26.969 --> 00:53:32.422
Then they dropped chunks of
iron into the sea,

00:53:32.422 --> 00:53:38.480
as a symbol that the treaty was
to be perpetual.

00:53:38.480 --> 00:53:41.667
That is to say,
it would last until the iron

00:53:41.667 --> 00:53:44.409
came up and floated on the
surface.

00:53:44.409 --> 00:53:45.769
They knew that wasn't going to
happen.

00:53:45.769 --> 00:53:51.598
So, they are a standard kind of
an alliance with a perpetual--I

00:53:51.598 --> 00:53:57.521
need to make the point that most
Greek alliances that we hear of

00:53:57.521 --> 00:54:01.000
in this period are not
perpetual.

00:54:05.539 --> 00:54:09.451
The Athenians and the Spartans
in 445 make a thirty-years

00:54:09.451 --> 00:54:13.093
peace.
In 421, they make a fifty-years

00:54:13.093 --> 00:54:15.523
peace;
on another occasion they make a

00:54:15.523 --> 00:54:17.771
five-years peace;
that's the way they do things

00:54:17.771 --> 00:54:19.420
normally.
This is different.

00:54:19.420 --> 00:54:25.429
This is like the Greek League;
this is a perpetual alliance.

00:54:25.429 --> 00:54:29.291
The membership of the
league, as best we can figure it

00:54:29.291 --> 00:54:33.018
out--this is not a hundred
percent accurate but it's not

00:54:33.018 --> 00:54:35.930
bad.
It includes--First of all it,

00:54:35.930 --> 00:54:39.037
uniformally,
at this point--divides the

00:54:39.037 --> 00:54:43.013
league up into zones.
One is the islands of the

00:54:43.013 --> 00:54:47.282
Aegean Sea, and we have
knowledge of twenty towns that

00:54:47.282 --> 00:54:52.407
are members from the islands.
Ionia, that is on the coast of

00:54:52.407 --> 00:54:56.228
Asia Minor itself,
thirty six, towns along the

00:54:56.228 --> 00:54:59.539
Hellespont route into the Black
Sea,

00:54:59.539 --> 00:55:03.125
thirty five,
Caria which is the southern

00:55:03.125 --> 00:55:06.619
coast of Asia Minor has twenty
four.

00:55:06.619 --> 00:55:12.185
Thrace, which is the northern
shore of the Aegean Sea in Greek

00:55:12.185 --> 00:55:16.183
territory is thirty three;
comes to a total of a hundred

00:55:16.183 --> 00:55:19.015
forty eight.
If you imagine you're talking

00:55:19.015 --> 00:55:23.461
about a hundred and fifty towns,
you've got the general idea

00:55:23.461 --> 00:55:26.188
right.
So, that's quite an amazing

00:55:26.188 --> 00:55:27.882
thing.
Peloponnesian League

00:55:27.882 --> 00:55:30.885
certainly didn't have anything
like that in terms of numbers of

00:55:30.885 --> 00:55:33.100
states.
But don't be too carried away,

00:55:33.100 --> 00:55:36.271
because lots of these places
are just tiny little spots,

00:55:36.271 --> 00:55:39.039
especially when you're talking
about islands.

00:55:39.039 --> 00:55:44.003
Some of the island states in
the Aegean and they apparently

00:55:44.003 --> 00:55:48.539
were just about all members,
are very small indeed.

00:55:48.539 --> 00:55:51.757
Still, it includes some very
important states like those big

00:55:51.757 --> 00:55:53.719
islands I mentioned already
Samos,

00:55:53.719 --> 00:55:57.682
Chios, and Lesbos,
and others that were not quite

00:55:57.682 --> 00:56:02.469
as big, and some states on the
Asian side that were old,

00:56:02.469 --> 00:56:08.104
and big, and important cities,
Miletus being one example of

00:56:08.104 --> 00:56:10.529
it.
So, there it is,

00:56:10.529 --> 00:56:14.530
notice what I have not
included.

00:56:14.530 --> 00:56:19.195
No Peloponnesians.
This is not in any shape,

00:56:19.195 --> 00:56:24.179
manner, or form connected with
the Peloponnesian League.

00:56:24.179 --> 00:56:26.962
I'm going to play my
analogy game in a moment too,

00:56:26.962 --> 00:56:30.059
but what I want to say is you
need to--it would be easiest I

00:56:30.059 --> 00:56:32.579
think for you to grasp what's
going on here,

00:56:32.579 --> 00:56:35.630
if you think of three separate
organizations;

00:56:35.630 --> 00:56:39.407
first, there's the Greek League
against Persia that was formed

00:56:39.407 --> 00:56:42.194
in 481 which includes
Peloponnesian states and

00:56:42.194 --> 00:56:45.025
non-Peloponnesian states.
Then keep in mind,

00:56:45.025 --> 00:56:47.900
the oldest of these,
I should have mentioned first,

00:56:47.900 --> 00:56:51.258
the Peloponnesian League,
which is older than the Greek

00:56:51.258 --> 00:56:54.573
League, which includes for our
purposes essentially only

00:56:54.573 --> 00:56:57.326
Peloponnesian states.
There are a couple of

00:56:57.326 --> 00:57:00.559
exceptions, but none are across
the sea in any way.

00:57:00.559 --> 00:57:04.905
Then there's this new league
which we should call the Delian

00:57:04.905 --> 00:57:09.250
League, although the Greeks
referred to it as the Greeks,

00:57:09.250 --> 00:57:12.809
just as they had the earlier
league.

00:57:12.809 --> 00:57:16.205
But it's easier to think of it
as the Delian League to separate

00:57:16.205 --> 00:57:19.541
it from that league.
Okay, here's the analogy

00:57:19.541 --> 00:57:22.662
that I suggest.
The Greek League against

00:57:22.662 --> 00:57:27.181
Persia, we might think of as
being like the United Nations

00:57:27.181 --> 00:57:31.338
Organization,
because it includes states from

00:57:31.338 --> 00:57:36.834
both sides, from all of these
places and I think if we think

00:57:36.834 --> 00:57:42.889
of the Peloponnesian League as
one of the subordinate leagues,

00:57:42.889 --> 00:57:46.399
and the Delian League as the
other, in other words,

00:57:46.399 --> 00:57:50.679
like NATO on the one hand and
the Warsaw Pact on the other,

00:57:50.679 --> 00:57:54.522
that will be a helpful analogy,
because, first of all,

00:57:54.522 --> 00:57:58.219
both of them are members of the
Greek League too,

00:57:58.219 --> 00:58:03.396
and as the United Nations
Organization Charter permits

00:58:03.396 --> 00:58:07.596
regional associations,
so NATO and the Warsaw Pact

00:58:07.596 --> 00:58:11.516
were regional associations,
so too without their being any

00:58:11.516 --> 00:58:14.593
formality about it,
it clearly didn't mean to

00:58:14.593 --> 00:58:16.719
abolish the Peloponnesian
League.

00:58:16.719 --> 00:58:20.386
Therefore, there was no reason
why there shouldn't be a

00:58:20.386 --> 00:58:23.781
different regional alliance like
that of the Delian

00:58:23.781 --> 00:58:27.787
League.That,
I think, is the structure of

00:58:27.787 --> 00:58:32.797
the international system in
Greece as we move past the

00:58:32.797 --> 00:58:36.492
Persian wars.
Now, let's say a little more

00:58:36.492 --> 00:58:39.807
about that Delian League;
there are more things you need

00:58:39.807 --> 00:58:43.133
to know about it.
It is a hegemonial league,

00:58:43.133 --> 00:58:46.670
just like the Peloponnesian
League.

00:58:46.670 --> 00:58:50.250
That is, there is a designated
leader.

00:58:50.250 --> 00:58:56.155
Athens is the designated
hegemon of the league,

00:58:56.155 --> 00:59:02.059
and there is also something
quite different,

00:59:02.059 --> 00:59:06.173
something new,
since this is a naval league,

00:59:06.173 --> 00:59:11.435
it cost money in a way that a
military league made up of

00:59:11.435 --> 00:59:16.734
hoplite citizens doesn't.
So it was clear there had to be

00:59:16.734 --> 00:59:19.829
some league money,
a league treasury.

00:59:19.829 --> 00:59:22.409
For this purpose,
they declared the collection of

00:59:22.409 --> 00:59:24.560
something they called a
phoros.

00:59:27.690 --> 00:59:30.282
It just simply means,
in the most neutral sense,

00:59:30.282 --> 00:59:33.149
contribution.
As time passed,

00:59:33.149 --> 00:59:38.945
this contribution was seen to
be something imposed upon

00:59:38.945 --> 00:59:45.492
unwilling payers and in English
we use the word to describe it

00:59:45.492 --> 00:59:48.565
as tribute.
But let's think now,

00:59:48.565 --> 00:59:51.681
for the moment,
only about the beginning of the

00:59:51.681 --> 00:59:54.460
league and what was intended at
first.

00:59:54.460 --> 00:59:58.410
So there is this contribution
which becomes the league

00:59:58.410 --> 01:00:02.823
treasury.
The assessor was an Athenian

01:00:02.823 --> 01:00:06.839
general, Aristides.
Aristides the just,

01:00:06.839 --> 01:00:10.119
as he was known,
told each state how much it

01:00:10.119 --> 01:00:14.595
would be required to contribute.
This took the form in the

01:00:14.595 --> 01:00:18.639
beginning, in some cases,
of ships and crews to row them,

01:00:18.639 --> 01:00:21.745
and in other states from the
very beginning,

01:00:21.745 --> 01:00:24.616
money.
Now, I think we should imagine

01:00:24.616 --> 01:00:28.560
that the earlier you are in the
league, the more there are

01:00:28.560 --> 01:00:32.444
allied ships and crews,
and as you get later and later,

01:00:32.444 --> 01:00:35.739
until finally you're into the
Peloponnesian War,

01:00:35.739 --> 01:00:39.772
just about every state doesn't
have a fleet of its own,

01:00:39.772 --> 01:00:43.769
doesn't supply crews,
but just pays money.

01:00:43.769 --> 01:00:45.953
Again though,
I urge you to think about the

01:00:45.953 --> 01:00:48.280
beginning and not worry about
the end just now.

01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:53.358
So the Athenian assesses that,
there is also an Athenian

01:00:53.358 --> 01:00:59.084
citizen who will be chosen for
the job of treasurer of this new

01:00:59.084 --> 01:01:02.057
league,
hellenotamias is the

01:01:02.057 --> 01:01:06.407
Greek word and he will see to
the collection and the security

01:01:06.407 --> 01:01:09.559
of that money;
an Athenian does that too.

01:01:09.559 --> 01:01:14.959
Also, any military or naval
campaigns conducted on behalf of

01:01:14.959 --> 01:01:20.449
the Delian League will have an
Athenian general in charge.

01:01:20.449 --> 01:01:22.470
Now you know,
looking at it backwards,

01:01:22.470 --> 01:01:24.327
you can say,
well, this is Athenian

01:01:24.327 --> 01:01:27.550
imperialism and the Athenians
are imposing their power;

01:01:27.550 --> 01:01:31.934
no, the allies would have been
the first to want to do this

01:01:31.934 --> 01:01:34.579
because what they were afraid
of,

01:01:34.579 --> 01:01:37.653
just as I think as the
Europeans were afraid in the

01:01:37.653 --> 01:01:41.156
forties, was not that the
Athenians would have lorded over

01:01:41.156 --> 01:01:43.256
them,
they were afraid that the

01:01:43.256 --> 01:01:46.659
Athenians would run away and
leave them to their fate.

01:01:46.659 --> 01:01:50.642
They wanted to tie the
Athenians into this new

01:01:50.642 --> 01:01:54.117
organization.
Now, this Delian League is

01:01:54.117 --> 01:01:57.839
unsurpassed among the few
international organizations

01:01:57.839 --> 01:02:02.199
there are in the Greek world.
It was enormously efficient

01:02:02.199 --> 01:02:06.646
because you had a leader who was
designated and interested,

01:02:06.646 --> 01:02:12.040
and deeply involved.
You had an organ for making

01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:14.815
decisions;
I haven't mentioned it,

01:02:14.815 --> 01:02:18.420
but there was what they called
this synod of the league.

01:02:18.420 --> 01:02:22.075
It's the council of league in
which there are representatives

01:02:22.075 --> 01:02:25.852
from every state and it can make
all the decisions that have to

01:02:25.852 --> 01:02:30.222
be made in that one place.
Unlike these other places it

01:02:30.222 --> 01:02:33.581
has its own money,
and its own forces,

01:02:33.581 --> 01:02:37.940
which are assigned to it by the
constitution.

01:02:37.940 --> 01:02:42.984
All of these things make that a
much more effective league,

01:02:42.984 --> 01:02:48.116
able to do what it has to do
without any great difficulty in

01:02:48.116 --> 01:02:51.963
the decision making process,
and to make that a little

01:02:51.963 --> 01:02:53.750
clearer I need to tell you
another thing.

01:02:53.750 --> 01:02:59.141
In the synod,
the arrangement was one state,

01:02:59.141 --> 01:03:03.117
one vote.
So, Athens was one member of

01:03:03.117 --> 01:03:07.272
that synod.
Athens, which had the lion's

01:03:07.272 --> 01:03:10.340
share of the power,
had only one vote.

01:03:10.340 --> 01:03:13.632
So, how could the Athenians
have their way,

01:03:13.632 --> 01:03:16.646
you may ask.
But the way it really worked

01:03:16.646 --> 01:03:20.684
was, because Athens had all of
this prestige and all of this

01:03:20.684 --> 01:03:24.148
power,
it meant all of the very small

01:03:24.148 --> 01:03:29.750
powerless states huddled under
the wings of the Athenians,

01:03:29.750 --> 01:03:33.806
and could be counted on to
deliver the right sort of vote,

01:03:33.806 --> 01:03:36.440
to do what the Athenians told
them,

01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:40.663
whereas, supposing they had
used something like proportional

01:03:40.663 --> 01:03:44.806
representation,
given the Athenians "x" number

01:03:44.806 --> 01:03:50.269
of votes, a lot of votes,
but they would have had to give

01:03:50.269 --> 01:03:53.596
Thasos and Samos,
Chios, Lesbos,

01:03:53.596 --> 01:03:59.199
all these big towns and
islands, numerous votes as well.

01:03:59.199 --> 01:04:03.457
They would certainly have been
more votes than the Athenians

01:04:03.457 --> 01:04:05.631
had.
They could have outvoted them,

01:04:05.631 --> 01:04:07.780
the Athenians,
if they got together.

01:04:07.780 --> 01:04:10.949
Under this one state,
one vote rule,

01:04:10.949 --> 01:04:15.634
that's impossible.
We never, never hear of any

01:04:15.634 --> 01:04:22.130
trouble passing whatever the
Athenians want in the assembly.

01:04:22.130 --> 01:04:26.124
There's just no check on their
doing what they want in a

01:04:26.124 --> 01:04:27.650
constitutional way.

01:04:30.739 --> 01:04:34.658
Now, so long as everybody's
playing by the original rules

01:04:34.658 --> 01:04:37.989
this doesn't really present any
serious problems,

01:04:37.989 --> 01:04:41.276
but as time passes and there
are differences of opinion,

01:04:41.276 --> 01:04:44.525
and as for various reasons,
as I will explain,

01:04:44.525 --> 01:04:49.578
the Athenians begin to assert
their power and begin to change

01:04:49.578 --> 01:04:52.984
the situation,
it's at that point that the

01:04:52.984 --> 01:04:57.519
question of autonomy will arise,
and the Athenians will in fact

01:04:57.519 --> 01:05:01.250
interfere with the autonomy of
the other states,

01:05:01.250 --> 01:05:05.858
and turn the league ultimately
into what the Greeks called an

01:05:05.858 --> 01:05:09.221
arche,
which we rightly translate as

01:05:09.221 --> 01:05:13.569
an empire, but once again,
I don't want you to think about

01:05:13.569 --> 01:05:17.840
that when you're thinking about
the situation in 477.

01:05:17.840 --> 01:05:22.508
It's in the future,
and that's not what people are

01:05:22.508 --> 01:05:26.822
expecting or wanting.
There is a common interest,

01:05:26.822 --> 01:05:30.793
and it's very strong in 477,
to deal with the threat of the

01:05:30.793 --> 01:05:34.765
Persia and to get revenge and
payment from the Persians for

01:05:34.765 --> 01:05:39.482
what has happened.
The problem only emerges or

01:05:39.482 --> 01:05:46.000
problems emerge when the
challenge from Persia recedes,

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:49.545
and as we shall see,
that's of course was the same

01:05:49.545 --> 01:05:53.670
problem that NATO suffered from
and suffers from today,

01:05:53.670 --> 01:05:56.416
which is to the degree that
they don't feel threatened by

01:05:56.416 --> 01:05:59.360
anything, the states that are
allied to the United States,

01:05:59.360 --> 01:06:02.821
don't feel they have to do what
the Americans want,

01:06:02.821 --> 01:06:06.698
and that's the way it was when
the situation developed in

01:06:06.698 --> 01:06:09.826
Greece.
Okay, that's the original

01:06:09.826 --> 01:06:15.507
situation of the Delian League
and I want to turn next to the

01:06:15.507 --> 01:06:20.429
story of how that turns into the
Athenian Empire.

01:06:20.429 --> 01:06:24.359
The first thing I want to
indicate to you is that the

01:06:24.359 --> 01:06:27.657
success of the Delian League
from the outset was

01:06:27.657 --> 01:06:31.569
extraordinary.
One little town that was still

01:06:31.569 --> 01:06:36.692
in Persian hands in 477 was the
town of Eion located at the

01:06:36.692 --> 01:06:40.489
mouth of the Strymon River up in
Thrace.

01:06:40.489 --> 01:06:46.684
The Athenian commander took a
league fleet to Eion and drove

01:06:46.684 --> 01:06:50.601
the Persians out.
Soon thereafter--by the way,

01:06:50.601 --> 01:06:54.099
the dates that we have for this
are very insecure.

01:06:54.099 --> 01:06:59.006
They are mostly derived from
the story that Thucydides tells

01:06:59.006 --> 01:07:03.997
us, the details are very few and
he doesn't give us very many

01:07:03.997 --> 01:07:07.878
good dates, if any.
So, there's a certain amount of

01:07:07.878 --> 01:07:10.444
estimation.
It doesn't really matter from

01:07:10.444 --> 01:07:13.494
your point of view,
but I will give you dates that

01:07:13.494 --> 01:07:17.200
are commonly accepted,
but you mustn't imagine that

01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:20.112
they're firmly fixed.
Anyway, some years,

01:07:20.112 --> 01:07:23.328
not too many after the
establishment of the league,

01:07:23.328 --> 01:07:26.480
the league under the great
Athenian commander,

01:07:26.480 --> 01:07:30.100
who will play a larger and
larger role in league affairs

01:07:30.100 --> 01:07:32.800
and also in Athenian political
affairs,

01:07:32.800 --> 01:07:38.197
Cimon takes this force against
the Island of Skyros in the

01:07:38.197 --> 01:07:40.928
Aegean.
Skiros was attacked,

01:07:40.928 --> 01:07:44.059
because it was not inhabited by
Greeks.

01:07:44.059 --> 01:07:48.221
It was inhabited by non-Greek
peoples who made their living

01:07:48.221 --> 01:07:50.400
out of piracy.
Well clearly,

01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:55.079
all the states of the league
had a lot to lose from allowing

01:07:55.079 --> 01:07:58.409
pirates to roam freely in their
waters,

01:07:58.409 --> 01:08:04.365
and so Cimon crushed the
Skirian pirates and he drove

01:08:04.365 --> 01:08:08.898
them from the island,
and he made sure that the

01:08:08.898 --> 01:08:12.467
island would be secure by
putting in an Athenian

01:08:12.467 --> 01:08:15.677
cleruchy.
Remember that cleruchy

01:08:15.677 --> 01:08:17.810
the Athenians put in near
Chalkis.

01:08:17.810 --> 01:08:19.750
This is the same kind of
arrangement;

01:08:19.750 --> 01:08:25.632
Athenians of military age who
permanently settle in Skiros,

01:08:25.632 --> 01:08:29.689
but retain their Athenian
citizenship;

01:08:29.689 --> 01:08:34.709
they are a garrison in effect
to protect the island of Skyros

01:08:34.709 --> 01:08:38.390
from falling into bad hands in
the future.

01:08:38.390 --> 01:08:42.204
It was widely believed,
and justifiably,

01:08:42.204 --> 01:08:47.260
that Cimon and that force had
liberated the Aegean Sea.

01:08:47.260 --> 01:08:50.229
We never hear about piracy
anymore;

01:08:50.229 --> 01:08:54.462
piracy was a problem that the
states in the Mediterranean in

01:08:54.462 --> 01:08:58.407
general suffered from a lot and
at different times very,

01:08:58.407 --> 01:09:01.513
very seriously.
One thing that this new league,

01:09:01.513 --> 01:09:04.381
even when it's the Delian
League and one becomes the

01:09:04.381 --> 01:09:07.962
Athenian Empire,
there is no piracy in the

01:09:07.962 --> 01:09:12.836
region where that league exists.
Then they turn to the city of

01:09:12.836 --> 01:09:15.733
Carystos, which is at the
southern end of the Island of

01:09:15.733 --> 01:09:18.439
Euboea.
The Carystians you remember

01:09:18.439 --> 01:09:23.422
had, under the greatest military
pressure, actually surrendered

01:09:23.422 --> 01:09:26.921
to the Persians,
given earth and water,

01:09:26.921 --> 01:09:32.206
and so technically they were
Medizers and there was no mercy

01:09:32.206 --> 01:09:34.989
shown to them.
They were compelled,

01:09:34.989 --> 01:09:38.707
they didn't wish to do this,
but they were compelled to join

01:09:38.707 --> 01:09:43.125
the Delian League,
and to pay a cash contribution,

01:09:43.125 --> 01:09:47.720
not to be allowed to provide
their own ships.

01:09:47.720 --> 01:09:52.339
Thus, almost from the very
beginning, there is one instance

01:09:52.339 --> 01:09:56.661
of a state, which doesn't fit
the general picture I've been

01:09:56.661 --> 01:10:00.011
painting.
A state that is a subject state

01:10:00.011 --> 01:10:04.773
and is compelled to be a member,
but it's just this one case of

01:10:04.773 --> 01:10:10.221
a Medizing state.
Then possibly in the year 470,

01:10:10.221 --> 01:10:14.357
another development.
We hear that the island of

01:10:14.357 --> 01:10:17.100
Naxos--this seems to be an
island full of trouble.

01:10:17.100 --> 01:10:19.431
Every time we hear of Naxos,
it's getting into difficulty of

01:10:19.431 --> 01:10:21.937
some kind or another,
but they decided that there

01:10:21.937 --> 01:10:25.074
wasn't any great threat from
Persia, that the Persians

01:10:25.074 --> 01:10:28.979
weren't coming back and so they
said we're quitting the league.

01:10:28.979 --> 01:10:31.942
Well, I'm sure somebody said,
don't you remember,

01:10:31.942 --> 01:10:34.653
you swore this oath.
You threw some iron lumps into

01:10:34.653 --> 01:10:36.611
the sea.
Do you see any iron floating

01:10:36.611 --> 01:10:40.180
around here in the Aegean Sea?
You're not quitting.

01:10:40.180 --> 01:10:45.660
They rebelled.
The league sent a fleet,

01:10:45.660 --> 01:10:49.933
and they put down the Naxian
rebellion, and Naxos was now

01:10:49.933 --> 01:10:53.289
reduced from the category of a
free ally,

01:10:53.289 --> 01:10:57.001
making the kinds of
contributions the other allies

01:10:57.001 --> 01:11:02.149
did to another subject state,
which paid money.

01:11:02.149 --> 01:11:05.702
Their walls were taken down,
their fleet was taken away,

01:11:05.702 --> 01:11:08.479
and that's the pattern that we
shall see.

01:11:08.479 --> 01:11:12.494
States who don't carry out
their responsibilities,

01:11:12.494 --> 01:11:17.819
states that particularly try to
rebel will be treated this way,

01:11:17.819 --> 01:11:21.340
and their number will increase
as time passes.

01:11:21.340 --> 01:11:25.369
By the way, we do not hear of
anybody in the league objecting

01:11:25.369 --> 01:11:29.398
to these decisions and these
actions, nor should we expect to

01:11:29.398 --> 01:11:33.293
that there would be.
The allies still believed they

01:11:33.293 --> 01:11:37.707
needed this league and they
weren't about to let people get

01:11:37.707 --> 01:11:40.600
a free ride such as Carystos
would,

01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:43.105
whether they paid or not,
the Persians weren't going to

01:11:43.105 --> 01:11:44.729
attack them so they ought to
pay,

01:11:44.729 --> 01:11:47.390
or states like Naxos who
decided, well,

01:11:47.390 --> 01:11:50.816
we feel safe enough so we quit.
That wasn't going to be

01:11:50.816 --> 01:11:52.531
permitted.
So in a sense,

01:11:52.531 --> 01:11:56.141
what you can really see from
this is that the league was

01:11:56.141 --> 01:12:00.079
working, as it was supposed to,
to be able to do the job that

01:12:00.079 --> 01:12:03.125
it had too.
Then if the dates are right,

01:12:03.125 --> 01:12:06.761
in the next year 469,
comes a very important turning

01:12:06.761 --> 01:12:09.470
point in the history of the
league.

01:12:09.470 --> 01:12:15.635
The Persians have a fleet in
the--well, you can't really call

01:12:15.635 --> 01:12:19.489
it the Aegean,
it's around the corner on the

01:12:19.489 --> 01:12:23.907
southern coast of Asia Minor,
the Eurymedon river flows out

01:12:23.907 --> 01:12:27.640
there and they had a fleet and
an army inland.

01:12:27.640 --> 01:12:33.545
The league forces went there to
the Eurymedon under the command

01:12:33.545 --> 01:12:39.069
of Cimon, defeated and crushed
the Persian fleet at sea,

01:12:39.069 --> 01:12:43.320
landed and defeated the Persian
army on the land,

01:12:43.320 --> 01:12:48.457
and that was a terrible blow to
the Persian position in the

01:12:48.457 --> 01:12:53.718
eastern Mediterranean.
The evidence is apparently that

01:12:53.718 --> 01:12:59.159
the Persians had to pull back
from that entire area and it

01:12:59.159 --> 01:13:04.695
would not have been at all
unreasonable for people to think

01:13:04.695 --> 01:13:07.733
well,
the Persian threat really is

01:13:07.733 --> 01:13:11.116
over.
This is beyond what happened in

01:13:11.116 --> 01:13:13.522
479;
it's not just that we've driven

01:13:13.522 --> 01:13:16.640
them out of Europe,
we've driven them away from the

01:13:16.640 --> 01:13:20.738
Mediterranean Sea.
You could imagine that that's

01:13:20.738 --> 01:13:24.199
just the end of the Persian
threat.

01:13:24.199 --> 01:13:29.028
That was not the view taken
by the Athenians,

01:13:29.028 --> 01:13:32.649
or I guess, by most of the
allies,

01:13:32.649 --> 01:13:36.151
but we can imagine that there
were some of the allies,

01:13:36.151 --> 01:13:39.454
who were restless in their need
to continue to make

01:13:39.454 --> 01:13:43.617
contributions to the league when
they didn't feel that there was

01:13:43.617 --> 01:13:46.260
any purpose to the league
anymore.

01:13:49.310 --> 01:13:52.793
I gave a hint to this earlier.
I don't remember whether

01:13:52.793 --> 01:13:56.535
General Grunther was the second
commander of NATO,

01:13:56.535 --> 01:13:59.819
but he was an earlier commander
of NATO,

01:13:59.819 --> 01:14:03.729
obviously a West Point man,
educated, he knew all about

01:14:03.729 --> 01:14:07.638
Thucydides and the Peloponnesian
War and so he made the

01:14:07.638 --> 01:14:11.619
analogy--the first time I'm
aware that anybody did,

01:14:11.619 --> 01:14:15.601
between NATO and the Delian
League, and he was doing so as

01:14:15.601 --> 01:14:19.722
commander of NATO at a period
when he felt that the American

01:14:19.722 --> 01:14:24.053
allies in Europe were more and
more reluctant to make the kinds

01:14:24.053 --> 01:14:27.964
of contributions that he thought
they should make and was

01:14:27.964 --> 01:14:31.341
bewailing his situation,
which was every time the

01:14:31.341 --> 01:14:33.529
Russians looked like they were
going to behave,

01:14:33.529 --> 01:14:35.956
then the allies decided they
didn't want to make any

01:14:35.956 --> 01:14:38.215
contributions,
and then when the Russians

01:14:38.215 --> 01:14:40.248
looked scary,
everybody came running and

01:14:40.248 --> 01:14:43.427
said, sure we'll contribute and
he suggested that's the way it

01:14:43.427 --> 01:14:45.200
was in the Delian League too.

01:14:48.489 --> 01:14:52.518
So keep in the back of your
mind that there are real

01:14:52.518 --> 01:14:56.942
questions out there in the
league as to whether it should

01:14:56.942 --> 01:14:58.987
persist,
and we'll carry this story

01:14:58.987 --> 01:15:00.253
forward next time.

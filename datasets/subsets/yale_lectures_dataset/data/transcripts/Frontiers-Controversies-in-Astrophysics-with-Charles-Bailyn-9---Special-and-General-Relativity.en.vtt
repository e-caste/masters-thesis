00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:03.344
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Okay,

00:00:03.344 --> 00:00:06.544
let's start--let's see,
we started talking about black

00:00:06.544 --> 00:00:09.261
holes last time,
and there's now going to be a

00:00:09.261 --> 00:00:12.461
problem set that is going to be
available later today,

00:00:12.461 --> 00:00:15.932
due next week.
And I should also point that

00:00:15.932 --> 00:00:19.530
I've put together this website
on black holes.

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:24.345
Actually, some of the help
sheets already send you to that

00:00:24.345 --> 00:00:28.047
website.
And I'll put a link on the

00:00:28.047 --> 00:00:33.873
classes server as a whole,
but here it is as an actual

00:00:33.873 --> 00:00:38.270
URL, cmi.yale.edu/bh for black
holes.

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.856
And that website kind of serves
as a sort of online textbook for

00:00:42.856 --> 00:00:47.202
this part of the course.
And so, you have something

00:00:47.202 --> 00:00:53.050
written down to look at for this
whole section of the course.

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.152
And, as you'll see,
many of the things we'll be

00:00:56.152 --> 00:00:59.660
talking about are actually
discussed on that website,

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.367
as well.
So, you can find out more

00:01:03.367 --> 00:01:09.032
information there.
Okay, so I--last time,

00:01:09.032 --> 00:01:15.838
I defined a black hole.
This is simply something where

00:01:15.838 --> 00:01:21.390
the escape velocity is faster
than the speed of light.

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.733
Or, alternatively,
and this is--amounts to the

00:01:24.733 --> 00:01:28.002
exact same thing,
the radius of the object is

00:01:28.002 --> 00:01:30.900
less than the Schwarzschild
radius,

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.700
which is defined for an object
of any given mass.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.336
And this isn't particularly
extraordinary or interesting,

00:01:40.336 --> 00:01:45.386
as long as the speed of light
isn't particularly extraordinary

00:01:45.386 --> 00:01:48.436
or interesting.
And one of the things that

00:01:48.436 --> 00:01:51.674
happens when you start talking
about relativity is that it

00:01:51.674 --> 00:01:55.140
turns out the speed of light is
a very important quantity.

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:06.228
So this--these are interesting
because the speed of light is

00:02:06.228 --> 00:02:10.322
interesting.
And, we'll talk in a minute

00:02:10.322 --> 00:02:13.140
about how all this arises,
but one of the interesting

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.770
things about the speed of light
is that you can't go any faster.

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.806
It's the speed limit,
and no physical process can

00:02:20.806 --> 00:02:24.590
make you go faster than the
speed of light.

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.920
So, c is fastest
velocity possible.

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.276
And the consequence of that is,
supposing you have one of these

00:02:37.276 --> 00:02:39.568
black hole things--so,
here's some object,

00:02:39.568 --> 00:02:43.222
and it's got some radius.
And its radius and its mass are

00:02:43.222 --> 00:02:47.223
such that the escape velocity,
here, is greater than the speed

00:02:47.223 --> 00:02:50.412
of light.
You could imagine that around

00:02:50.412 --> 00:02:53.230
it is a kind of imaginary
sphere.

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:59.485
Let's put it in dots.
And this is the sphere where

00:02:59.485 --> 00:03:03.879
the escape velocity is equal to
the speed of light.

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:09.122
And you remember what the
formula for the escape

00:03:09.122 --> 00:03:14.030
velocity--V&lt;/
i&gt;_esc is equal to

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:19.530
2GM / R,
the square root of 2GM /

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.460
R.
And so, if on the surface of

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:27.240
this object, the escape velocity
is greater than that of light,

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:30.374
if you keep moving out,
R will keep getting

00:03:30.374 --> 00:03:32.994
bigger.
And so, eventually you'll come

00:03:32.994 --> 00:03:37.083
to a point in space where the
escape velocity is equal to the

00:03:37.083 --> 00:03:40.014
speed of light,
and this is called the event

00:03:40.014 --> 00:03:40.900
horizon.

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:47.848
And the reason it's called that
is because, if nothing can go

00:03:47.848 --> 00:03:51.897
faster than the speed of light,
what it means is that any event

00:03:51.897 --> 00:03:56.233
that takes place inside this
imaginary sphere can't radiate

00:03:56.233 --> 00:04:00.419
any information about what's
going on to the outside,

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:03.682
because this--the escape
velocity's greater than the

00:04:03.682 --> 00:04:05.969
speed of light.
Light can't escape,

00:04:05.969 --> 00:04:09.884
and because nothing else can go
faster than the speed of light,

00:04:09.884 --> 00:04:15.858
nothing else can escape.
And so, no information of any

00:04:15.858 --> 00:04:24.100
kind can come--comes from inside
the event horizon to the

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:25.720
outside.

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:35.532
And so, in a certain
philosophical sense,

00:04:35.532 --> 00:04:39.994
this event horizon sort of
constitutes an edge of the

00:04:39.994 --> 00:04:43.009
Universe,
because nothing that happens

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:46.470
inside can affect what happens
outside in any way.

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:49.673
You can't see in.
You can't detect anything that

00:04:49.673 --> 00:04:53.225
goes on inside.
No event inside this event

00:04:53.225 --> 00:04:57.773
horizon can tell us
what's--about itself or--and

00:04:57.773 --> 00:05:02.536
we--there's no--in principle,
there's no way we can find out

00:05:02.536 --> 00:05:05.480
anything about what happens
inside an event horizon.

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:08.658
It turns out that this rather
grandiose statement,

00:05:08.658 --> 00:05:11.771
that the event horizon
constitutes an edge of the

00:05:11.771 --> 00:05:14.949
Universe, has a mathematical
meaning as well.

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:18.885
The great physicist Stephen
Hawking--you may have heard

00:05:18.885 --> 00:05:20.990
about him.
He's the guy in the wheelchair.

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:24.856
His --shorthand--his--one of
his great discoveries was to

00:05:24.856 --> 00:05:29.275
demonstrate that the mathematics
of the event horizon is actually

00:05:29.275 --> 00:05:32.934
very similar to the mathematics
of another edge of the

00:05:32.934 --> 00:05:36.751
Universe--namely The Big Bang,
which is the start of the

00:05:36.751 --> 00:05:39.219
Universe in time.
And so, it turns out that this

00:05:39.219 --> 00:05:42.287
statement that this constitutes
an edge of the Universe is not

00:05:42.287 --> 00:05:45.305
just a philosophical statement
having to do with defining the

00:05:45.305 --> 00:05:47.670
Universe as something we might
eventually,

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:50.300
possibly, know something about,
or be influenced by,

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.260
but also has a mathematical
meaning,

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.762
as well.
And so, the way you have to

00:05:54.762 --> 00:05:57.150
think about the Universe is as a
kind of Swiss cheese.

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:00.447
There are holes in it.
There are holes in it,

00:06:00.447 --> 00:06:04.694
which aren't part of our
Universe, where these little

00:06:04.694 --> 00:06:09.332
event horizons cut pieces out.
And it's this kind of thing

00:06:09.332 --> 00:06:13.865
that gives black holes the kind
of extraordinary aura of mystery

00:06:13.865 --> 00:06:16.959
that they sort of have in
everyday life.

00:06:16.959 --> 00:06:23.500
Various strange things happen
inside the event horizon.

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:25.803
And now I better pause,
because I just contradicted

00:06:25.803 --> 00:06:28.101
myself, right?
Because I said a minute ago

00:06:28.101 --> 00:06:31.743
that you can't find out anything
about what happens in the event

00:06:31.743 --> 00:06:33.981
horizon,
and now I'm about to tell you

00:06:33.981 --> 00:06:36.079
what happens inside an event
horizon.

00:06:36.079 --> 00:06:40.528
Okay, so it--we're ten--we're
eight minutes into class and

00:06:40.528 --> 00:06:43.259
already I'm contradicting
myself.

00:06:43.259 --> 00:06:45.829
And so, let me explain exactly
what I mean by this.

00:06:45.829 --> 00:06:49.812
Here's what you do if you want
to make statements about what's

00:06:49.812 --> 00:06:52.750
going on the inside of one of
these things.

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:56.785
What you do is you take the
equations that apply outside the

00:06:56.785 --> 00:06:59.635
event horizon.
You assume that the same

00:06:59.635 --> 00:07:03.660
equations are going to apply
inside the event horizon.

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:05.626
Turns out, the mathematics of
these things,

00:07:05.626 --> 00:07:07.920
and I'll show you an example of
this next week,

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:11.670
the mathematics of these things
do very bizarre things at the

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:14.676
event horizon.
But mathematicians are smart

00:07:14.676 --> 00:07:16.499
people.
One can cope with these kinds

00:07:16.499 --> 00:07:18.334
of problems.
It tends--you tend to have

00:07:18.334 --> 00:07:20.539
problems like,
everything gets divided by zero

00:07:20.539 --> 00:07:23.554
right at the event horizon.
But, as you may recall,

00:07:23.554 --> 00:07:26.307
if you've done a good
pre-calculus course,

00:07:26.307 --> 00:07:30.402
there are ways you can get past
those kinds of infinities--but

00:07:30.402 --> 00:07:34.401
everything goes haywire.
But, if you make the assumption

00:07:34.401 --> 00:07:38.373
that the same set of equations
apply inside the event horizon

00:07:38.373 --> 00:07:41.460
as outside,
you can then manipulate those

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:46.152
equations, interpret the results
as if the symbols mean the same

00:07:46.152 --> 00:07:50.612
thing inside as they do outside,
and then make statements about

00:07:50.612 --> 00:07:53.019
what happens inside the event
horizon.

00:07:53.019 --> 00:07:55.899
And this looks a lot like
physics, right?

00:07:55.899 --> 00:07:57.604
Because you've got a bunch of
equations and,

00:07:57.604 --> 00:07:59.190
you know, some of them stand
for time,

00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:01.188
and some of them stand for
space, and energy,

00:08:01.188 --> 00:08:04.260
and all this good stuff.
And you can do manipulations of

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.517
those equations,
and then you can make

00:08:06.517 --> 00:08:10.655
statements about what happens.
But, it looks like physics--you

00:08:10.655 --> 00:08:14.290
can make an argument that it
isn't actually physics,

00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:17.242
because you're making an
assumption that those equations

00:08:17.242 --> 00:08:20.116
apply inside there,
and that's an assumption that

00:08:20.116 --> 00:08:22.436
is un-testable.
Even in principle,

00:08:22.436 --> 00:08:25.601
un-testable,
because you can't ever get any

00:08:25.601 --> 00:08:29.897
information about what's going
on in there to see if those

00:08:29.897 --> 00:08:34.778
really are the right equations.
And so, here's something where

00:08:34.778 --> 00:08:38.681
it looks like physics but,
depending on what you define

00:08:38.681 --> 00:08:42.583
the limits of physics to be--and
this is kind of a deep

00:08:42.583 --> 00:08:46.992
philosophical question that we
won't go too far into--it might

00:08:46.992 --> 00:08:50.625
actually be something that,
while interesting,

00:08:50.625 --> 00:08:54.730
it is really something else.
So, just a couple of examples

00:08:54.730 --> 00:08:59.456
of the kinds of things that you
can deduce from the mathematics

00:08:59.456 --> 00:09:02.810
about what goes on inside event
horizons.

00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:09.602
One--here's something.
All matter with R less

00:09:09.602 --> 00:09:14.830
than the Schwarzschild
radius--oh, this distance,

00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:17.194
here, will always be the
Schwarzschild radius,

00:09:17.194 --> 00:09:19.506
by definition,
because that's the radius away

00:09:19.506 --> 00:09:22.711
from an object where the escape
velocity is equal to the speed

00:09:22.711 --> 00:09:26.612
of light.
So, all matter inside the

00:09:26.612 --> 00:09:33.958
Schwarzschild radius collapses
to a single point in a finite

00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:38.576
amount of time;
so, it doesn't take forever to

00:09:38.576 --> 00:09:40.799
do this.
And that points--since it's got

00:09:40.799 --> 00:09:43.720
a lot of matter but no volume,
that's what a point is--that's

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:45.230
a point of infinite density.

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:53.710
And this is sometimes called a
singularity.

00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:00.875
And you can see some of the
problems with doing mathematics

00:10:00.875 --> 00:10:03.759
inside event horizons.
If you try and calculate the

00:10:03.759 --> 00:10:05.990
density for this--density is
mass over volume.

00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:08.504
If you've got a bunch of mass
in a single point,

00:10:08.504 --> 00:10:10.912
the volume is zero,
and you've just divided by

00:10:10.912 --> 00:10:13.320
zero, and you're in all kinds of
trouble.

00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:20.557
So it--everything collapses
down to a point of infinite

00:10:20.557 --> 00:10:23.048
density.
There's no force strong enough

00:10:23.048 --> 00:10:26.077
to stop this from happening.
You can't set up a rocket

00:10:26.077 --> 00:10:29.439
system to keep yourself in orbit
or keep yourself from falling

00:10:29.439 --> 00:10:31.261
down.
Partly that--one way of

00:10:31.261 --> 00:10:34.986
understanding that is that the
energy you would exert in trying

00:10:34.986 --> 00:10:37.690
to hold yourself up has a mass
equivalent.

00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:39.944
You'll recall that E =
mc^(2),

00:10:39.944 --> 00:10:43.090
so for a given amount of energy
there's a mass equivalent.

00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:45.190
The extra mass just pulls you
down more.

00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:49.507
So you can't--by expending
energy, you can't hold yourself

00:10:49.507 --> 00:10:53.370
up inside a singularity,
so everything collapses.

00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:57.097
It's also true--this is the
kind of thing you see in popular

00:10:57.097 --> 00:11:00.214
accounts of black holes.
The statement is sometimes

00:11:00.214 --> 00:11:03.220
made: the properties of space
and time are reversed.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.240
That's a weird thing to say.
What could this possibly mean?

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:15.634
Well, let's see.
It's related actually to what I

00:11:15.634 --> 00:11:20.049
just said, that everything falls
down to a singularity.

00:11:20.049 --> 00:11:24.659
In an ordinary situation,
we can move around in space.

00:11:24.659 --> 00:11:28.020
I can expend energy and move
all around in space.

00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:31.149
I can move back and forth.
I could jump up and down,

00:11:31.149 --> 00:11:35.481
see--but you don't have a lot
of choice of where you go in

00:11:35.481 --> 00:11:38.127
time.
You move forward in time at the

00:11:38.127 --> 00:11:40.230
rate of one day per day,
right?

00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:43.952
And you can expend a lot of
energy trying to avoid that,

00:11:43.952 --> 00:11:46.659
and it won't actually do you
any good.

00:11:46.659 --> 00:11:51.389
So, inside an event horizon you
fall down to a singularity.

00:11:51.389 --> 00:11:53.860
And, as I said,
you can expend a lot of energy

00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:56.549
but it doesn't change your
trajectory in space.

00:11:56.549 --> 00:12:00.070
So, what happens when you fire
off your rocket?

00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:03.063
Well, in principle,
providing you believe in all

00:12:03.063 --> 00:12:05.611
these equations,
you could, in principle,

00:12:05.611 --> 00:12:08.701
move around in time.
And, this is why the science

00:12:08.701 --> 00:12:12.213
fiction writers like black holes
so much, because it's a kind of

00:12:12.213 --> 00:12:14.500
scientifically-certified time
machine.

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:17.485
You go into the event horizon.
You turn on your energy pack

00:12:17.485 --> 00:12:20.810
and move all around in time.
And then, what they forget to

00:12:20.810 --> 00:12:23.907
tell you is that you're inside
an event horizon,

00:12:23.907 --> 00:12:27.135
so it does you no good,
because you can't come out

00:12:27.135 --> 00:12:28.703
again.
And so, then,

00:12:28.703 --> 00:12:32.662
the effort is to try and figure
a way that you could have this

00:12:32.662 --> 00:12:37.009
nice effect of the time machine
without having an event horizon.

00:12:37.009 --> 00:12:39.648
And, in particular,
there's some interest in

00:12:39.648 --> 00:12:42.838
whether one can have what's been
described as a naked

00:12:42.838 --> 00:12:45.056
singularity.
A naked singularity is a

00:12:45.056 --> 00:12:47.271
singularity with no event
horizon around it,

00:12:47.271 --> 00:12:50.310
so that you could get in down
to where all the weird physics

00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:52.809
happens,
and then come back out again.

00:12:52.809 --> 00:12:58.279
Hawking proposed what he called
the Cosmic Censorship Theorem.

00:12:58.279 --> 00:13:02.166
That is the statement that
naked singularities are not

00:13:02.166 --> 00:13:04.032
allowed.
And so, hence,

00:13:04.032 --> 00:13:07.509
censorship can't have naked
singularities.

00:13:07.509 --> 00:13:09.216
And there is,
to this day,

00:13:09.216 --> 00:13:12.970
some dispute over whether that
will turn out to be true,

00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:17.720
in general, or not.
And you can go on in this vein.

00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:22.385
You can talk--you can talk on
and on about the extraordinary

00:13:22.385 --> 00:13:27.288
physical events and properties
that these things might actually

00:13:27.288 --> 00:13:30.250
have.
And what you have to keep in

00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:34.831
mind, as you're doing this,
is that there's a limit to how

00:13:34.831 --> 00:13:38.183
much this could ever,
even in principle,

00:13:38.183 --> 00:13:41.941
be realized in real life.
You know, you fall into one of

00:13:41.941 --> 00:13:44.891
these wormholes that they like
to have on the science

00:13:44.891 --> 00:13:47.330
fiction--in the science fiction
stories,

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:51.291
and you'd better have some very
tricky physics if you're going

00:13:51.291 --> 00:13:53.629
to be able to come back out
again.

00:13:53.629 --> 00:13:57.644
And that's not something that
the science fiction world

00:13:57.644 --> 00:14:00.402
typically dwells on.
Although, it is

00:14:00.402 --> 00:14:03.470
interesting--you know the movie
Contact?

00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:07.940
So, this is based on Carl
Sagan's novel of the same name.

00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:11.203
And, one of the things that
happens late in this--this is

00:14:11.203 --> 00:14:12.659
the first use,
I think,

00:14:12.659 --> 00:14:15.417
in science fiction,
of the concept of a worm hole,

00:14:15.417 --> 00:14:18.456
where you fall into a black
hole and you fall out again

00:14:18.456 --> 00:14:21.269
somewhere totally different in
space and time.

00:14:21.269 --> 00:14:24.456
And there's an interesting
story about this--that what

00:14:24.456 --> 00:14:26.701
happened, supposedly,
was that Sagan,

00:14:26.701 --> 00:14:30.089
when he was writing his novel,
got to the point in the novel

00:14:30.089 --> 00:14:33.190
and he needed something to
happen for plot reasons,

00:14:33.190 --> 00:14:36.570
in order to move the plot
forward.

00:14:36.570 --> 00:14:39.797
And he--Sagan himself was not
an expert in relativity,

00:14:39.797 --> 00:14:42.049
so he called up one of his
friends,

00:14:42.049 --> 00:14:44.776
who was a guy named Kip Thorne,
one of the most famous general

00:14:44.776 --> 00:14:46.412
relativity people.
He said, look,

00:14:46.412 --> 00:14:48.480
here's what has to happen in my
novel.

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:51.919
Give me some science jargon so
that--that will make this work.

00:14:51.919 --> 00:14:54.510
And Thorne, who was a very
smart guy, thought about this

00:14:54.510 --> 00:14:57.196
for a while, and came up with
this concept of the wormhole

00:14:57.196 --> 00:14:59.218
that,
you know, you fall into a black

00:14:59.218 --> 00:15:02.210
hole here and you fall out of it
again on the other side.

00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:05.389
Then, Thorne went away and
thought about this for a while.

00:15:05.389 --> 00:15:07.756
At least, this is what he
claims in his book,

00:15:07.756 --> 00:15:09.799
and said, you know,
this might work.

00:15:09.799 --> 00:15:14.054
And a whole series of
scientific papers flowed from

00:15:14.054 --> 00:15:17.073
that.
So, here is a place where art

00:15:17.073 --> 00:15:20.302
pushed science.
Art in the form of science

00:15:20.302 --> 00:15:24.377
fiction, if you consider that
art, pushes science--pushes

00:15:24.377 --> 00:15:27.421
science forward,
rather than the other way

00:15:27.421 --> 00:15:29.879
around--quite unusual,
in that case.

00:15:29.879 --> 00:15:34.830
All right, so,
all of this is great.

00:15:34.830 --> 00:15:40.723
But I want to focus a little
bit on what does it actually

00:15:40.723 --> 00:15:42.819
mean?
These grand statements that one

00:15:42.819 --> 00:15:45.276
makes about, you can't go faster
than the speed of light,

00:15:45.276 --> 00:15:47.250
space and time are reversed,
and so forth.

00:15:47.250 --> 00:15:50.309
What actually underlies those
statements?

00:15:50.309 --> 00:15:54.924
And to what extent are these
sort of spectacular kinds of

00:15:54.924 --> 00:15:58.879
phenomena actually realized in
the real world?

00:15:58.879 --> 00:16:01.519
So, I'm an observational
astronomer.

00:16:01.519 --> 00:16:04.660
What right do I even have to
talk about black holes,

00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:08.294
the number one characteristic
of which is that you can't see

00:16:08.294 --> 00:16:11.642
them at all?
So, that's where we're going to

00:16:11.642 --> 00:16:13.928
go in a minute,
and to do that,

00:16:13.928 --> 00:16:17.815
we have to talk about
relativity--special relativity

00:16:17.815 --> 00:16:22.236
and general relativity--because
those are the theories that

00:16:22.236 --> 00:16:27.144
underlie all of this.
So, before we go plunging into

00:16:27.144 --> 00:16:31.490
that let me pause for questions
at this point.

00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:40.051
Yes?
Student: [Inaudible]

00:16:40.051 --> 00:16:41.667
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Yes,

00:16:41.667 --> 00:16:44.360
you should be.
Yes, so the--a little confused

00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:46.870
about why space and time are
reversed.

00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:49.709
Let me not answer that now,
because there's,

00:16:49.709 --> 00:16:53.143
there's math next week,
which will make that a little

00:16:53.143 --> 00:16:56.058
bit clearer.
I think it is a legitimate

00:16:56.058 --> 00:17:00.131
question, not just to ask why
are space and time reversed,

00:17:00.131 --> 00:17:04.026
but what that even could mean.
And we'll get back to that in a

00:17:04.026 --> 00:17:04.720
little while.

00:17:07.970 --> 00:17:11.684
Let me--yes, go ahead.
Student: [Inaudible]

00:17:11.684 --> 00:17:14.661
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Right,

00:17:14.661 --> 00:17:17.623
and doesn't--so,
supposing you have,

00:17:17.623 --> 00:17:20.882
for example,
a neutron star that's a little

00:17:20.882 --> 00:17:23.829
bit smaller than its event
horizon,

00:17:23.829 --> 00:17:26.304
why wouldn't it just stay there
inside its event horizon,

00:17:26.304 --> 00:17:28.832
rather than collapsing down?
And again, this is a

00:17:28.832 --> 00:17:32.319
calculation that I don't think I
can demonstrate for you,

00:17:32.319 --> 00:17:36.026
but it comes about because the
energy, the pressure forces that

00:17:36.026 --> 00:17:39.332
would have to hold it up,
actually also contribute to the

00:17:39.332 --> 00:17:42.044
mass of the thing.
And if you then compute the

00:17:42.044 --> 00:17:45.518
balance, the hydrostatic
equilibrium that we were talking

00:17:45.518 --> 00:17:47.690
about last time,
it never works.

00:17:47.690 --> 00:17:49.998
It can't work,
because the amount of energy

00:17:49.998 --> 00:17:53.186
required to hold it up is so
great that the mass equivalent

00:17:53.186 --> 00:17:56.319
is going to generate additional
gravitational forces.

00:17:56.319 --> 00:17:58.222
And if this were a different
kind of course,

00:17:58.222 --> 00:18:00.390
I'd do the calculation,
but let's not go there.

00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:07.351
Yes?
Student: Time originally

00:18:07.351 --> 00:18:08.450
goes forward,
right?

00:18:08.450 --> 00:18:09.973
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Yeah,

00:18:09.973 --> 00:18:12.069
I would say.
No, no that's fine--yeah.

00:18:12.069 --> 00:18:13.349
Student: It can go
backward?

00:18:13.349 --> 00:18:15.560
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Well,

00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:17.771
the thing is,
in our normal situation,

00:18:17.771 --> 00:18:20.640
we have no choice about where
we go in time.

00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:24.143
And the statement that I made,
which I didn't back up in any

00:18:24.143 --> 00:18:27.587
way to--that a rational person
would really want to believe

00:18:27.587 --> 00:18:30.259
me--but let me make this
statement again.

00:18:30.259 --> 00:18:34.440
Inside the event horizon,
you can move around in time.

00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:37.690
You don't necessarily have to
go forward.

00:18:37.690 --> 00:18:42.453
And that is the thing--that is
the piece of the picture that

00:18:42.453 --> 00:18:46.410
the science fiction writers tend
to hone in on.

00:18:46.410 --> 00:18:51.157
And so, you know,
the statement is made about

00:18:51.157 --> 00:18:54.262
relativity.
And I'll make this explicit in

00:18:54.262 --> 00:18:59.259
a little while.
Time is the fourth dimension.

00:18:59.259 --> 00:19:02.714
There are three space
dimensions, one time dimension,

00:19:02.714 --> 00:19:06.170
and you can do all sorts of
calculations that way.

00:19:06.170 --> 00:19:08.867
But it's perfectly clear,
just from everyday life,

00:19:08.867 --> 00:19:11.674
that the time dimension is not
the same as the space

00:19:11.674 --> 00:19:13.864
dimensions,
because we don't have the

00:19:13.864 --> 00:19:15.829
opportunity to move around in
them.

00:19:15.829 --> 00:19:18.466
So, it must be true that in a
certain sense,

00:19:18.466 --> 00:19:21.900
time--the time dimension,
if you want to call it that,

00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:25.870
of the space-time continuum,
must somehow behave differently

00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:28.474
from the spatial components.
And they do,

00:19:28.474 --> 00:19:30.470
and I'll show you why in a
little while.

00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:37.385
And that behavior is reversed
between space and time inside

00:19:37.385 --> 00:19:41.349
the event horizon.
Things that are positive terms

00:19:41.349 --> 00:19:43.930
in the equation become negative,
and vice versa.

00:19:43.930 --> 00:19:47.073
And as I say,
we'll actually--I'll actually

00:19:47.073 --> 00:19:50.789
write some of this down.
Yeah?

00:19:50.789 --> 00:19:52.678
Student: Since,
like, nothing could escape--can

00:19:52.678 --> 00:19:54.201
escape from a black hole,
is one of, like,

00:19:54.201 --> 00:19:55.743
the possible,
you know, scenarios for the end

00:19:55.743 --> 00:19:57.202
of the Universe,
be--if --all matter being in

00:19:57.202 --> 00:19:58.725
the form of black holes?
Professor Charles

00:19:58.725 --> 00:20:00.723
Bailyn: All--okay,
so since nothing can escape

00:20:00.723 --> 00:20:02.639
from a black hole,
is that a possible end of the

00:20:02.639 --> 00:20:04.289
Universe?
Yes.

00:20:04.289 --> 00:20:07.583
One of the potential ways the
Universe could evolve--the

00:20:07.583 --> 00:20:10.872
Universe is expanding right now.
Again, this is now in the third

00:20:10.872 --> 00:20:12.609
part of the course,
we'll talk about this.

00:20:12.609 --> 00:20:15.303
The Universe is expanding,
but it's got a lot of matter in

00:20:15.303 --> 00:20:16.275
it.
So, in principle,

00:20:16.275 --> 00:20:17.920
it could stop expanding and
collapse.

00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:20.583
You could ask the question,
"Does the Universe expand

00:20:20.583 --> 00:20:22.990
faster than its own escape
velocity, or not?"

00:20:22.990 --> 00:20:25.184
And this is a question that
cannot only be asked,

00:20:25.184 --> 00:20:27.036
but answered.
It could expand,

00:20:27.036 --> 00:20:30.170
slow down, stop,
fall back together again.

00:20:30.170 --> 00:20:32.463
And, if that happened at a
certain point when it fell

00:20:32.463 --> 00:20:34.800
together, the whole Universe
would be inside its event

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:37.453
horizon.
Now, how that would affect

00:20:37.453 --> 00:20:41.619
those of us who are inside is a
little less clear.

00:20:41.619 --> 00:20:43.559
Eventually, you'd get crushed,
right?

00:20:43.559 --> 00:20:47.469
But--because nothing would be
able to stop the inexorable

00:20:47.469 --> 00:20:50.750
collapse down to a singularity
at that point.

00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:53.023
But yeah, that is a potential
end of the Universe,

00:20:53.023 --> 00:20:55.250
is-- we all end up inside a big
event horizon.

00:20:55.250 --> 00:20:57.539
We all collapse down to a
singularity in the middle.

00:20:57.539 --> 00:20:59.700
It turns out,
that isn't what's going to

00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:02.470
happen--at least,
not from current observations.

00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:05.512
The current observation is that
the Universe is expanding faster

00:21:05.512 --> 00:21:07.998
than its own escape velocity.
So, you have the opposite

00:21:07.998 --> 00:21:10.369
ending point where it just keeps
getting bigger and bigger,

00:21:10.369 --> 00:21:13.606
and more and more diffuse and
sparse, and cold and boring,

00:21:13.606 --> 00:21:16.885
and the Universe ends that way.
But again, that's part three of

00:21:16.885 --> 00:21:18.200
the course.
We'll get there.

00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:20.541
Yes?
Student: [Inaudible]

00:21:20.541 --> 00:21:22.730
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Where does all the

00:21:22.730 --> 00:21:26.320
mass go when it collapses?
The mass is still there.

00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:29.252
The mass is still there.
And this is actually a very

00:21:29.252 --> 00:21:32.425
important point,
because things can still be in

00:21:32.425 --> 00:21:35.529
orbit around a black hole and
not fall in.

00:21:35.529 --> 00:21:38.673
Because, when you're far enough
away, when you're outside the

00:21:38.673 --> 00:21:40.978
event horizon,
it just behaves like any other

00:21:40.978 --> 00:21:43.034
mass.
Black holes can move through

00:21:43.034 --> 00:21:44.610
space.
They can orbit around other

00:21:44.610 --> 00:21:46.470
things.
Things can orbit around them.

00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:49.724
If the Sun turned into a black
hole right now,

00:21:49.724 --> 00:21:52.672
well, we would freeze.
But aside from that,

00:21:52.672 --> 00:21:56.371
the orbit of the Earth--if the
Sun turned into a black hole of

00:21:56.371 --> 00:22:00.367
the same mass as the Earth,
the orbit of the Earth wouldn't

00:22:00.367 --> 00:22:04.863
change, because we're far enough
away that it just seems like any

00:22:04.863 --> 00:22:08.108
other mass down there.
So, a solar mass black hole

00:22:08.108 --> 00:22:11.417
could have a planet in exactly
the same orbit as the Earth is

00:22:11.417 --> 00:22:14.253
around the Sun.
This is one of the differences

00:22:14.253 --> 00:22:18.124
between how black holes actually
behave and the metaphorical use

00:22:18.124 --> 00:22:21.131
of black holes.
You know, this is one of those

00:22:21.131 --> 00:22:24.869
words that gets used in common
culture for various things,

00:22:24.869 --> 00:22:28.473
and it usually carries a
connotation of a kind of great

00:22:28.473 --> 00:22:31.009
sucking thing that pulls
everything in,

00:22:31.009 --> 00:22:33.529
inexorably.
That's true inside the event

00:22:33.529 --> 00:22:36.079
horizon, which is where this
idea arises from.

00:22:36.079 --> 00:22:37.765
But, if you're outside the
event horizon,

00:22:37.765 --> 00:22:40.039
you can just keep going around
in circles around it,

00:22:40.039 --> 00:22:42.771
in exactly the same way that
you can be in orbit around any

00:22:42.771 --> 00:22:44.965
other kind of mass.
Student: [Inaudible]

00:22:44.965 --> 00:22:47.063
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Why is there no

00:22:47.063 --> 00:22:48.759
volume?
Ah, okay.

00:22:48.759 --> 00:22:52.309
So, why is there no volume with
this stuff at the center?

00:22:52.309 --> 00:22:55.248
If there's nothing to--think
about what we were talking

00:22:55.248 --> 00:22:57.859
about, hydrostatic equilibrium,
the other day.

00:22:57.859 --> 00:23:01.974
If there's nothing to stop the
collapse, every--if there's no

00:23:01.974 --> 00:23:06.019
energy or pressure force
sufficient to stop the collapse,

00:23:06.019 --> 00:23:09.040
everything has to end up in the
same place.

00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:12.136
It all falls to the center.
And, you can calculate how long

00:23:12.136 --> 00:23:14.910
that will take.
And after that happens,

00:23:14.910 --> 00:23:17.759
all the mass is down at the
center.

00:23:17.759 --> 00:23:19.760
What does it mean to be the
center?

00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:22.263
It's the central point.
Now, in fact,

00:23:22.263 --> 00:23:26.930
there's got to be--this is how
it works in relativity.

00:23:26.930 --> 00:23:30.190
Relativity does not incorporate
quantum mechanics.

00:23:30.190 --> 00:23:33.130
Quantum mechanics does funny
things when things get small.

00:23:33.130 --> 00:23:36.444
And so, it is likely that there
are physical effects that we

00:23:36.444 --> 00:23:39.477
don't understand at the quantum
level before you get to

00:23:39.477 --> 00:23:42.960
precisely the same point--but we
don't know what they are,

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:45.339
because that would require a
theory that encompasses

00:23:45.339 --> 00:23:48.140
special--general relativity and
quantum mechanics at the same

00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:50.017
time.
And until the string theorists

00:23:50.017 --> 00:23:52.349
finish their work,
we don't have such a theory.

00:23:52.349 --> 00:23:56.276
So, probably something happens
to prevent a pure point,

00:23:56.276 --> 00:23:59.890
but we don't know what it is.
And so, from the point of view

00:23:59.890 --> 00:24:01.794
on the outside,
you just imagine everything

00:24:01.794 --> 00:24:04.559
falling down toward a central
point, and kind of landing there

00:24:04.559 --> 00:24:08.430
in some way.
But it is a mystery. Yes?

00:24:08.430 --> 00:24:12.865
Student: [Inaudible]
Professor Charles

00:24:12.865 --> 00:24:16.074
Bailyn: Is the Universe
finite?

00:24:16.074 --> 00:24:18.571
Yes.
It's got to--in fact,

00:24:18.571 --> 00:24:23.133
you know it has to be finite,
because the sky is dark at

00:24:23.133 --> 00:24:25.440
night.
Let me explain that.

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:29.087
If the Universe were infinite
and had stars distributed at

00:24:29.087 --> 00:24:33.512
random throughout the Universe,
then any direction you looked

00:24:33.512 --> 00:24:37.339
at, you'd eventually see the
surface of a star.

00:24:37.339 --> 00:24:40.743
You could do this in a calculus
kind of way by integrating over

00:24:40.743 --> 00:24:45.620
the total light of the Universe.
And so, it can't be infinite in

00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:50.671
extent, and filled with
stars--the same as stars like

00:24:50.671 --> 00:24:52.929
the Sun,
or any kind of star,

00:24:52.929 --> 00:24:55.069
really, that is distributed
evenly.

00:24:55.069 --> 00:24:58.609
So, one of several things must
be the case.

00:24:58.609 --> 00:25:01.071
Either the Universe is
inhomogeneous--that is to say,

00:25:01.071 --> 00:25:03.958
we live in a very special place
where there are stars--after a

00:25:03.958 --> 00:25:05.710
while there are no stars
anymore.

00:25:05.710 --> 00:25:09.200
Or, it has to be finite in
extent.

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:12.060
It only goes out a certain
distance and stops.

00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:16.006
Or, it has to be finite in time.
That is to say,

00:25:16.006 --> 00:25:20.063
it began a certain number of
years ago, and didn't exist

00:25:20.063 --> 00:25:21.877
before that.
That helps you,

00:25:21.877 --> 00:25:24.329
because then you only--if
it's--if the Universe is 13

00:25:24.329 --> 00:25:26.847
billion years old,
you only see things that are

00:25:26.847 --> 00:25:30.119
within 13 billion light years,
because the light hasn't had a

00:25:30.119 --> 00:25:33.114
chance to travel.
It turns out that it's pro--the

00:25:33.114 --> 00:25:36.310
easiest way to understand this
is, it's the latter.

00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:40.261
The Universe had a beginning.
And this is the whole idea of

00:25:40.261 --> 00:25:43.759
The Big Bang--that it started as
some kind of very small object,

00:25:43.759 --> 00:25:48.795
and then expanded at some
finite and indeed calculable

00:25:48.795 --> 00:25:51.506
time ago.
The Universe is now thought to

00:25:51.506 --> 00:25:54.451
be, I think it's 13.7,
plus or minus 0.4 billion years

00:25:54.451 --> 00:25:57.054
old.
And so, the finiteness of the

00:25:57.054 --> 00:26:01.178
Universe is--at the moment,
is--the primary reason it's

00:26:01.178 --> 00:26:04.079
finite is that it's finite in
time,

00:26:04.079 --> 00:26:06.200
not so much that it's finite in
space.

00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:08.818
But, it has to be limited in
some way, or you'd see an

00:26:08.818 --> 00:26:13.662
infinite amount of starlight.
Student: [Inaudible]

00:26:13.662 --> 00:26:19.059
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Excellent.

00:26:19.059 --> 00:26:21.730
If the Universe is finite,
what's outside the Universe?

00:26:21.730 --> 00:26:23.640
That is exactly the right
question.

00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:27.096
I can't answer that,
because--although I will try in

00:26:27.096 --> 00:26:30.493
section three of the course.
We'll learn much more about

00:26:30.493 --> 00:26:32.430
this stuff.
I can't answer that because,

00:26:32.430 --> 00:26:35.407
you know, what is the Universe?
The Universe is what we can

00:26:35.407 --> 00:26:38.819
study, scientifically.
And so, the very first question

00:26:38.819 --> 00:26:42.950
that a sensible person has about
The Big Bang and the finite

00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:47.156
Universe is what's outside it.
And that's actually not a

00:26:47.156 --> 00:26:50.418
science question,
because it's intrinsically

00:26:50.418 --> 00:26:53.150
unanswerable by scientific
means.

00:26:53.150 --> 00:26:55.655
Now, there are things you can
say about it,

00:26:55.655 --> 00:26:59.116
just as there are things you
can say about the inside of an

00:26:59.116 --> 00:27:01.382
event horizon.
And you can base them on

00:27:01.382 --> 00:27:04.461
scientific ideas and scientific
thinking, and you can say these

00:27:04.461 --> 00:27:06.250
nice things about space and
time.

00:27:06.250 --> 00:27:09.596
And one could say similar
things about what's outside the

00:27:09.596 --> 00:27:11.986
Universe and,
you know, how it might have

00:27:11.986 --> 00:27:15.369
come to be and so forth.
But you've done a little

00:27:15.369 --> 00:27:19.714
epistemological shift when you
start talking about those kinds

00:27:19.714 --> 00:27:21.879
of things,
because you're no longer

00:27:21.879 --> 00:27:24.151
talking about things that,
even in principle,

00:27:24.151 --> 00:27:26.630
can be verified by observation
or experiment.

00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:28.869
So, I do have some things to
say about that.

00:27:28.869 --> 00:27:31.213
I'll say it in the third part
of the course when we talk about

00:27:31.213 --> 00:27:33.711
the Universe.
But you should think about what

00:27:33.711 --> 00:27:36.935
I have to say about that in a
different way from what

00:27:36.935 --> 00:27:40.531
you--from what you think about
what I have to say about how

00:27:40.531 --> 00:27:45.560
planets orbit around the Sun.
We'll come back to this later.

00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:47.374
Yes, go ahead.
Student: I was just

00:27:47.374 --> 00:27:51.670
curious about the black holes.
How do they find them?

00:27:51.670 --> 00:27:52.568
Professor Charles
Bailyn: How do they find

00:27:52.568 --> 00:27:53.864
them?
That's the next three weeks of

00:27:53.864 --> 00:27:55.622
the course.
That--and, in fact,

00:27:55.622 --> 00:27:59.680
that is subject of my research.
This is what I do for a living.

00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:02.129
I find black holes,
and I'll tell you how it's

00:28:02.129 --> 00:28:04.181
done.
We can see if we can find

00:28:04.181 --> 00:28:06.922
another one over the next few
weeks or so.

00:28:06.922 --> 00:28:10.131
Yes?
Student: [Inaudible]

00:28:10.131 --> 00:28:13.685
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Ah,

00:28:13.685 --> 00:28:19.370
is it possible that we are
inside an event horizon and we

00:28:19.370 --> 00:28:22.897
don't know it?
Yes, in that--again,

00:28:22.897 --> 00:28:27.289
this relates to the question
that was asked over here.

00:28:27.289 --> 00:28:29.946
Could it be that the Universe
is going to ultimately collapse

00:28:29.946 --> 00:28:32.759
and be inside a black hole?
Supposing that happened.

00:28:32.759 --> 00:28:35.295
Supposing we were in the
collapsing phase of the

00:28:35.295 --> 00:28:37.884
Universe, gradually,
over many billions of years,

00:28:37.884 --> 00:28:39.880
falling down to some
singularity;

00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:42.150
we would not necessarily know
that.

00:28:42.150 --> 00:28:46.343
Now, if you approach a black
hole that is of the size of a

00:28:46.343 --> 00:28:50.315
star, or even the size of a
galaxy--when you got close,

00:28:50.315 --> 00:28:53.037
you'd feel it.
And the way you'd feel it is,

00:28:53.037 --> 00:28:55.542
is if you're falling in,
your feet would be closer to

00:28:55.542 --> 00:28:58.805
the center than your head.
And the gravitational force on

00:28:58.805 --> 00:29:01.914
your feet would be stronger than
that on your head,

00:29:01.914 --> 00:29:06.395
and you'd stretch.
And so, if we were really near

00:29:06.395 --> 00:29:11.900
to a black hole of a size of
objects we understand,

00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:14.771
then we'd know that,
because the tidal force is on

00:29:14.771 --> 00:29:17.818
our bodies would mean that we
couldn't keep ourselves

00:29:17.818 --> 00:29:19.734
together.
But, you could imagine a

00:29:19.734 --> 00:29:22.523
sufficiently big black hole,
kind of encompassing the whole

00:29:22.523 --> 00:29:24.880
Universe, that wouldn't affect
us in that way.

00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:29.299
So, it's not inconceivable.
Yeah?

00:29:29.299 --> 00:29:33.527
Student: [Inaudible]
Professor Charles

00:29:33.527 --> 00:29:37.665
Bailyn: Yeah,
so the word "reverse" in this

00:29:37.665 --> 00:29:42.433
"reverse space and time"--how
about this: I agree that

00:29:42.433 --> 00:29:48.550
might--that wording might not
be--I've seen this wording used,

00:29:48.550 --> 00:29:51.179
which is why I used it.
But I agree that it might not

00:29:51.179 --> 00:29:53.230
be the best wording one could
use.

00:29:53.230 --> 00:29:56.760
How about, the properties of
space and the properties of time

00:29:56.760 --> 00:29:58.819
are interchanged with each
other?

00:29:58.819 --> 00:30:01.849
That's--then it doesn't have
this kind of directional thing.

00:30:01.849 --> 00:30:05.230
It's about how these things
behave.

00:30:10.090 --> 00:30:12.104
Yeah?
Student: Do we get--does

00:30:12.104 --> 00:30:14.500
the Earth get any heat from
other stars than the Sun?

00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:15.497
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Yes.

00:30:15.497 --> 00:30:16.190
Well, of course,
we do.

00:30:16.190 --> 00:30:18.710
If you look out in the sky,
you see stars.

00:30:18.710 --> 00:30:21.019
We see the radiation from those
stars.

00:30:21.019 --> 00:30:23.960
And so, of course,
there's radiation in all forms,

00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:27.415
heat and otherwise.
The fraction of the radiation

00:30:27.415 --> 00:30:32.259
that we get from sources other
than the Sun is extremely small.

00:30:32.259 --> 00:30:33.965
The-- Student:
[Inaudible]

00:30:33.965 --> 00:30:35.990
Professor Charles
Bailyn: No.

00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:39.455
No, because--and here's why:
because, the second most

00:30:39.455 --> 00:30:43.720
prominent source of heat that we
have is actually geothermal heat

00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:48.395
from the center of the Earth.
And that's vastly more than the

00:30:48.395 --> 00:30:51.190
sum of all contributions by
stars.

00:30:51.190 --> 00:30:54.357
And it's vastly less than what
we get from the--from our own

00:30:54.357 --> 00:30:55.630
Sun.
And so, you know,

00:30:55.630 --> 00:30:58.874
radioactivity and the latent
heat in the core of the Earth,

00:30:58.874 --> 00:31:01.335
that's, by far,
more than anything that comes

00:31:01.335 --> 00:31:04.965
to us from the stars.
But, we certainly do get energy

00:31:04.965 --> 00:31:07.344
radiation from the stars.
If we didn't,

00:31:07.344 --> 00:31:09.734
astronomers would be out of
business, because this is how

00:31:09.734 --> 00:31:12.380
we--this is how we study them,
by looking at the radiation.

00:31:12.380 --> 00:31:14.780
Yeah?
Student: Okay,

00:31:14.780 --> 00:31:17.112
so let's say that you're inside
the event horizon of a black

00:31:17.112 --> 00:31:19.717
hole and--as I remember,
the circular velocity of any

00:31:19.717 --> 00:31:21.970
object is less than the escape
velocity?

00:31:21.970 --> 00:31:22.660
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Uh-huh.

00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:24.525
Student: So couldn't you
theoretically orbit the black

00:31:24.525 --> 00:31:26.390
hole inside the event horizon
after the circular velocity?

00:31:26.390 --> 00:31:27.065
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Ah,

00:31:27.065 --> 00:31:29.523
excellent question.
Could you orbit--could you get

00:31:29.523 --> 00:31:33.220
yourself into a stable orbit
inside an event horizon?

00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:37.306
If everything were in--worked
the way Newtonian mechanics says

00:31:37.306 --> 00:31:39.723
it works, you could.
But, it turns out,

00:31:39.723 --> 00:31:41.609
there are relativistic
corrections.

00:31:41.609 --> 00:31:45.642
There is something called the
smallest circular--smallest--the

00:31:45.642 --> 00:31:51.554
Innermost Circular Stable Orbit.
IC--ISCO, Innermost Stable

00:31:51.554 --> 00:31:54.680
Circular Orbit.
That's important,

00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:57.393
because that actually can be
observed in various ways,

00:31:57.393 --> 00:31:59.849
and we'll talk about this in
two weeks' time.

00:31:59.849 --> 00:32:03.054
The Innermost Stable Circular
Orbit turns out to be outside

00:32:03.054 --> 00:32:05.098
the event horizon.
But, you're right,

00:32:05.098 --> 00:32:07.444
if you were only using
Newtonian calculations,

00:32:07.444 --> 00:32:09.529
there would be that square root
of 2,

00:32:09.529 --> 00:32:12.309
and you could imagine being in
a circular orbit inside the

00:32:12.309 --> 00:32:14.623
event horizon.
But that's one of the things

00:32:14.623 --> 00:32:17.579
that is different about the
relativistic calculation.

00:32:17.579 --> 00:32:21.563
It turns out that for
non-rotating black holes the

00:32:21.563 --> 00:32:26.685
Innermost Stable Circular Orbit
is three times the Schwarzschild

00:32:26.685 --> 00:32:28.559
radius.
Yes?

00:32:28.559 --> 00:32:35.712
Student: [Inaudible]
Professor Charles

00:32:35.712 --> 00:32:39.059
Bailyn: Ah,
yes.

00:32:39.059 --> 00:32:43.474
So, is there a potential for a
black hole to accumulate an

00:32:43.474 --> 00:32:47.423
infinite amount of mass,
which is the sort of vacuum

00:32:47.423 --> 00:32:49.714
cleaner scenario?
First of all,

00:32:49.714 --> 00:32:52.473
there isn't an infinite amount
of mass in the Universe,

00:32:52.473 --> 00:32:54.779
necessarily.
The Universe is finite.

00:32:54.779 --> 00:32:57.118
Second of all,
even if there was,

00:32:57.118 --> 00:33:01.648
if there was a huge black hole
here, and something else outside

00:33:01.648 --> 00:33:06.178
the event horizon that's moving
faster than the escape velocity

00:33:06.178 --> 00:33:08.480
of this thing,
at that point,

00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:12.013
then it doesn't fall in.
So, it's not necessarily true

00:33:12.013 --> 00:33:15.450
that it will pile up an infinite
amount of mass.

00:33:15.450 --> 00:33:19.758
In fact, black holes--black
holes ought not to have infinite

00:33:19.758 --> 00:33:21.674
mass.
They ought to have a particular

00:33:21.674 --> 00:33:23.908
amount of mass.
They'll gain more as stuff

00:33:23.908 --> 00:33:27.506
falls, but if stuff doesn't fall
in, if it's moving faster than

00:33:27.506 --> 00:33:30.640
the escape velocity,
then they won't accumulate it.

00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:32.850
Student: [Inaudible]
Professor Charles

00:33:32.850 --> 00:33:35.813
Bailyn: Well it depends what
you have--we observed extremely

00:33:35.813 --> 00:33:38.055
massive holes.
It depends what you mean by

00:33:38.055 --> 00:33:40.696
"extremely massive."
The mass--most massive black

00:33:40.696 --> 00:33:43.808
holes that we know anything
about are about three billion

00:33:43.808 --> 00:33:46.588
times the mass of the Sun.
So, that's pretty massive,

00:33:46.588 --> 00:33:48.700
but it's about the same as an
ordinary galaxy.

00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:54.422
And we--what we don't have
evidence for is black holes that

00:33:54.422 --> 00:34:00.539
are substantially more massive
than whole galaxies of stars.

00:34:00.539 --> 00:34:02.309
We don't--there's no evidence
for that.

00:34:02.309 --> 00:34:04.766
So they're, basically--just to
jump ahead, they're basically

00:34:04.766 --> 00:34:07.390
two kinds of black holes that we
have empirical evidence for.

00:34:07.390 --> 00:34:11.500
One are black holes the--about
ten times the mass of the Sun.

00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:14.797
So, masses of individual stars.
Then there are the so-called

00:34:14.797 --> 00:34:17.376
supermassive black holes,
which are the masses of whole

00:34:17.376 --> 00:34:19.127
galaxies,
and those are the kinds of

00:34:19.127 --> 00:34:21.890
black holes for which we have
direct evidence at the moment.

00:34:21.890 --> 00:34:25.204
Yes?
Student: [Inaudible]

00:34:25.204 --> 00:34:28.404
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Okay,

00:34:28.404 --> 00:34:33.506
so, is it possible to detect
the presence of a black hole by

00:34:33.506 --> 00:34:37.210
looking at things around it?
Yes.

00:34:37.210 --> 00:34:40.479
That's exactly what is done,
and we'll--I'll describe this

00:34:40.479 --> 00:34:44.648
in the next couple of weeks.
But, it doesn't happen the way

00:34:44.648 --> 00:34:47.039
you suggest.
It's not like something

00:34:47.039 --> 00:34:49.757
suddenly disappears,
so we know it fell into the

00:34:49.757 --> 00:34:52.300
event horizon.
What you do is you see these

00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:55.364
things in stable orbits
around--that are perfectly happy

00:34:55.364 --> 00:34:58.150
going around in circles,
around the black hole.

00:34:58.150 --> 00:35:00.152
For example,
you can see binary stars,

00:35:00.152 --> 00:35:02.425
double stars,
in which there's a black hole

00:35:02.425 --> 00:35:05.322
and something else.
And these things are in nice

00:35:05.322 --> 00:35:07.978
stable orbits,
and you infer the properties of

00:35:07.978 --> 00:35:11.460
one object by looking at the
motion of the other object.

00:35:11.460 --> 00:35:13.320
That's exactly what we did for
the planets.

00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:16.880
And so, you can do that again
for black holes.

00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:21.146
Student: [Inaudible]
Professor Charles

00:35:21.146 --> 00:35:26.320
Bailyn: If you actually saw
something disappearing?

00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:29.789
Yeah, and in fact there
is--there is indirect evidence

00:35:29.789 --> 00:35:33.587
that there's material falling
through--that in some systems

00:35:33.587 --> 00:35:36.991
there is material currently
falling through the event

00:35:36.991 --> 00:35:39.557
horizon of black holes.
And, in fact,

00:35:39.557 --> 00:35:42.483
that's one of the things that
is a current topic of active

00:35:42.483 --> 00:35:44.639
research, is,
can you demonstrate that?

00:35:44.639 --> 00:35:47.103
If there were a black hole in
our own Solar System,

00:35:47.103 --> 00:35:48.730
anywhere near us,
we'd know it.

00:35:48.730 --> 00:35:51.699
And the reason we'd know it is,
that's a lot of mass.

00:35:51.699 --> 00:35:53.610
It would disrupt the orbits of
the planets.

00:35:53.610 --> 00:35:57.012
And as long as the planets--and
so, we have a kind of early

00:35:57.012 --> 00:35:59.788
warning system.
If a black hole cruises by,

00:35:59.788 --> 00:36:02.159
Pluto's orbit gets disturbed
first.

00:36:02.159 --> 00:36:05.745
And so, all of those nice
objects out there in the Kuiper

00:36:05.745 --> 00:36:09.714
Belt, their orbits would go all
haywire if something as massive

00:36:09.714 --> 00:36:13.107
as a stellar mass black hole
were accidentally to come

00:36:13.107 --> 00:36:15.408
nearby,
in exactly the same way they

00:36:15.408 --> 00:36:18.555
would be as if an ordinary star
of the same mass were to come

00:36:18.555 --> 00:36:20.087
by.
You wouldn't be able to see it,

00:36:20.087 --> 00:36:22.090
but the orbits of everything
would be changed rather

00:36:22.090 --> 00:36:24.409
drastically.
So, the odds of us actually

00:36:24.409 --> 00:36:27.291
falling into a black hole are
extremely small,

00:36:27.291 --> 00:36:30.429
and if it were to happen,
we'd get a great deal of

00:36:30.429 --> 00:36:33.800
advance notice.
So, not to worry.

00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:38.238
There are astronomical things
you maybe should worry about,

00:36:38.238 --> 00:36:42.829
asteroids crashing into the
Earth, this isn't one of them.

00:36:42.829 --> 00:36:45.939
Actually, Bethany Cobb and I
were on a TV show that explored

00:36:45.939 --> 00:36:48.610
this particular possibility.
This is a wonderful thing.

00:36:48.610 --> 00:36:51.172
It happened last summer,
where ABC News decided to have

00:36:51.172 --> 00:36:53.973
a two-hour special on all the
different ways the Earth could

00:36:53.973 --> 00:36:56.108
be destroyed.
And they called us up,

00:36:56.108 --> 00:36:59.313
and we went down to New York.
It was very entertaining,

00:36:59.313 --> 00:37:02.099
and you know--but,
I was too much of a scientist.

00:37:02.099 --> 00:37:03.550
I kept saying it isn't going to
happen.

00:37:03.550 --> 00:37:05.837
You shouldn't worry about it.
You know, you should worry

00:37:05.837 --> 00:37:07.895
about the asteroids and global
warming, and all this kind of

00:37:07.895 --> 00:37:10.003
stuff.
Don't be worrying about black

00:37:10.003 --> 00:37:12.139
holes coming rolling in.
And, of course,

00:37:12.139 --> 00:37:14.455
the consequence of that is that
I didn't get a lot of screen

00:37:14.455 --> 00:37:16.572
time.
And the guys from the American

00:37:16.572 --> 00:37:19.996
Museum of Natural History,
who were better at popularizing

00:37:19.996 --> 00:37:22.760
science than I am,
got all the screen time.

00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:26.258
So, you know, I know better now.
We'll speak in better sound

00:37:26.258 --> 00:37:29.900
bites next time around.
Yeah, that was fun.

00:37:29.900 --> 00:37:36.473
But we should screen it,
you know, or at least the first

00:37:36.473 --> 00:37:39.780
part.
Other questions?

00:37:39.780 --> 00:37:42.020
All will become clear in due
time.

00:37:42.020 --> 00:37:45.006
Actually, that's not true.
But some things will become

00:37:45.006 --> 00:37:48.310
clear in real time.
Gosh, this was great, excellent.

00:37:48.310 --> 00:37:54.544
All sorts of questions.
So now, let me at least start

00:37:54.544 --> 00:37:57.480
talking about special
relativity.

00:37:57.480 --> 00:38:00.639
There are two kinds of
relativity.

00:38:00.639 --> 00:38:06.680
There's special relativity--and
special relativity,

00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:13.808
which was devised in 1905 by
Einstein--this is essentially a

00:38:13.808 --> 00:38:19.401
set of laws of motion.
So, it's the same thing as

00:38:19.401 --> 00:38:24.116
Newton's Laws of Motion,
only it's a more elaborate

00:38:24.116 --> 00:38:26.723
version of it.
So it substitutes,

00:38:26.723 --> 00:38:28.954
if you will,
for Newton's Laws of Motion,

00:38:28.954 --> 00:38:31.240
and in fact,
incorporates Newton's Laws of

00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:34.314
Motion.
Then there's general

00:38:34.314 --> 00:38:42.130
relativity, discovered about ten
years later, again by Einstein.

00:38:42.130 --> 00:38:46.039
And this is the equivalent of a
law of gravity.

00:38:46.039 --> 00:38:50.900
You'll remember that the way
one has to calculate orbits in

00:38:50.900 --> 00:38:54.249
the Newtonian Theory is,
you take Newton's Law of

00:38:54.249 --> 00:38:56.880
Gravity and you plug it into
Newton's Laws of Motion.

00:38:56.880 --> 00:39:00.222
So, this is a change,
or an enhancement,

00:39:00.222 --> 00:39:03.792
in the laws of motion.
This is a change or an

00:39:03.792 --> 00:39:06.199
enhancement in the law of
gravity.

00:39:06.199 --> 00:39:10.943
In both of these cases – and
this is important to realize –

00:39:10.943 --> 00:39:13.849
it doesn't overturn what Newton
did.

00:39:13.849 --> 00:39:17.199
This is a misconception about
how scientific revolutions work.

00:39:17.199 --> 00:39:21.245
This is as revolutionary a set
of ideas as you could possibly

00:39:21.245 --> 00:39:24.351
imagine.
And yet, Newton's laws

00:39:24.351 --> 00:39:27.659
are--still hold.
They don't overturn them.

00:39:27.659 --> 00:39:30.930
What they do is,
they say, Newton's laws are not

00:39:30.930 --> 00:39:33.853
general laws,
but laws that only operate in

00:39:33.853 --> 00:39:38.488
certain specific situations.
These are now the general laws

00:39:38.488 --> 00:39:42.582
that operate always,
and Newton's calculations are a

00:39:42.582 --> 00:39:47.880
subset of these things that only
work under certain conditions.

00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:51.949
And just to jump ahead a little
bit--the condition is,

00:39:51.949 --> 00:39:55.405
there's a quantity--so,
now I'm going to talk,

00:39:55.405 --> 00:39:58.170
first, about special
relativity.

00:39:58.170 --> 00:40:02.475
We'll leave gravity until later.
But now, let's just talk about

00:40:02.475 --> 00:40:05.573
how things move.
And this is important,

00:40:05.573 --> 00:40:10.931
because this gives rise to the
limit on--to the limit on

00:40:10.931 --> 00:40:14.756
velocity.
All velocities must be left

00:40:14.756 --> 00:40:18.889
less than or equal to the speed
of light.

00:40:18.889 --> 00:40:21.630
You can't go faster than the
speed of light.

00:40:21.630 --> 00:40:26.634
And just to jump ahead,
the way Newton's Laws of Motion

00:40:26.634 --> 00:40:31.361
relate to special relativity is
through a parameter,

00:40:31.361 --> 00:40:37.305
a quantity called gamma [γ].
And this is equal to this

00:40:37.305 --> 00:40:39.710
quantity.
1 - V^(2) /

00:40:39.710 --> 00:40:42.281
c^(2),
the square root of that,

00:40:42.281 --> 00:40:44.659
in the denominator.
Okay.

00:40:44.659 --> 00:40:49.461
1 / (1 - V^(2) /
c^(2))^(1/2) And when

00:40:49.461 --> 00:40:52.833
V is much,
much less than the speed of

00:40:52.833 --> 00:40:56.340
light, then gamma is equal to 1.
You can see.

00:40:56.340 --> 00:40:58.832
If this--if V is much
less than the speed of light,

00:40:58.832 --> 00:41:00.450
this quantity is more or less
zero.

00:41:00.450 --> 00:41:04.619
You got 1 / 1.
Gamma = 1.

00:41:04.619 --> 00:41:08.650
Newtonian physics assumes that
gamma is equal to 1.

00:41:08.650 --> 00:41:12.610
So, this leads directly to all
of Newtonian physics.

00:41:16.909 --> 00:41:20.480
But, as velocities start to get
higher, gamma starts to be

00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:23.530
different from 1.
And if--as V approaches

00:41:23.530 --> 00:41:26.260
the speed of light,
what's going to happen?

00:41:26.260 --> 00:41:28.595
This is going--if V is
the speed of light,

00:41:28.595 --> 00:41:30.590
V^(2) / c^(2)
= 1.

00:41:30.590 --> 00:41:33.873
You've got 1 - 1 in the
denominator, so you've got zero

00:41:33.873 --> 00:41:36.814
in the denominator.
So, as V approaches the

00:41:36.814 --> 00:41:39.200
speed of light,
gamma approaches infinity.

00:41:42.309 --> 00:41:44.942
And then you get--so,
you start to get these

00:41:44.942 --> 00:41:46.350
relativistic effects.

00:41:49.719 --> 00:41:52.665
So, it turns out,
for example,

00:41:52.665 --> 00:41:57.946
in relativistic physics,
that mass isn't exactly what

00:41:57.946 --> 00:42:03.539
Newton thought mass was.
Mass is what's called the rest

00:42:03.539 --> 00:42:07.738
mass;
this is the Newtonian

00:42:07.738 --> 00:42:12.698
mass--times gamma.
So, if everything's moving

00:42:12.698 --> 00:42:15.950
slowly, and gamma = 1,
then the mass is exactly what

00:42:15.950 --> 00:42:18.310
Newton thought it was going to
be.

00:42:18.310 --> 00:42:22.110
It's a property of objects.
It's constant.

00:42:22.110 --> 00:42:25.369
It doesn't change.
Mass is conserved and you can

00:42:25.369 --> 00:42:29.237
do all the wonderful
calculations that you can do in

00:42:29.237 --> 00:42:32.749
Newtonian gravity.
Now, the properties of gamma

00:42:32.749 --> 00:42:36.039
are such--remember this goes to
infinity--that,

00:42:36.039 --> 00:42:40.235
therefore, as the velocity goes
to the speed of light,

00:42:40.235 --> 00:42:44.327
the mass approaches infinity,
because gamma approaches

00:42:44.327 --> 00:42:47.346
infinity.
And you're multiplying the

00:42:47.346 --> 00:42:52.828
Newtonian mass by some number
that's getting larger and larger

00:42:52.828 --> 00:42:58.670
and larger and larger as you get
closer to the speed of light.

00:42:58.670 --> 00:43:02.107
Now, what does this mean?
Remember Newton's Laws of

00:43:02.107 --> 00:43:03.957
Motion.
Let's go all the way back to

00:43:03.957 --> 00:43:08.305
Newton.
This is--force is equal to mass

00:43:08.305 --> 00:43:13.780
times acceleration.
Yeah, go ahead.

00:43:13.780 --> 00:43:18.019
Student: What does gamma
stand for?

00:43:18.019 --> 00:43:20.326
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Gamma is a parameter

00:43:20.326 --> 00:43:22.190
that tells you how relativistic
you are.

00:43:22.190 --> 00:43:32.802
It is defined by this.
So, it's a function of your

00:43:32.802 --> 00:43:34.760
velocity.
Yeah.

00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:39.500
And whether--and how--how much
bigger than 1 it is tells you

00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:43.920
how far away from the Newtonian
Theory relativity is.

00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:48.488
And, the faster you go--the
closer you get to the speed of

00:43:48.488 --> 00:43:53.378
light, the more relativistic you
become and the less Newtonian

00:43:53.378 --> 00:43:56.015
you are.
So, it's a parameter that tells

00:43:56.015 --> 00:43:59.469
you how close you are to Newton.
Other questions, yes?

00:43:59.469 --> 00:44:03.369
Student: How exactly is
gamma derived?

00:44:03.369 --> 00:44:04.188
[inaudible]
Professor Charles

00:44:04.188 --> 00:44:05.139
Bailyn: How was gamma
derived?

00:44:05.139 --> 00:44:08.779
I'll talk about the history of
this next time,

00:44:08.779 --> 00:44:13.551
but basically it was--Einstein
revised the Laws of Motion in

00:44:13.551 --> 00:44:17.795
response to some experiments,
which weren't giving the right

00:44:17.795 --> 00:44:19.830
Newtonian answer.
That's the short version,

00:44:19.830 --> 00:44:21.619
and we'll do the long version
next time.

00:44:21.619 --> 00:44:25.453
And, it was the genius of
Einstein that he recognized how

00:44:25.453 --> 00:44:28.739
it--how the Laws of Motion
should be modified,

00:44:28.739 --> 00:44:31.500
and indeed that they should be
modified at all,

00:44:31.500 --> 00:44:34.619
which was not most other
people's initial reaction to

00:44:34.619 --> 00:44:37.513
these experiments.
Okay, so now,

00:44:37.513 --> 00:44:42.840
what happens if your mass
becomes infinite?

00:44:42.840 --> 00:44:47.659
Right?
That means for a--remember this

00:44:47.659 --> 00:44:50.980
is acceleration,
and this is force.

00:44:50.980 --> 00:44:54.593
If your mass becomes infinite
then F / M,

00:44:54.593 --> 00:44:57.070
which is equal to the
acceleration,

00:44:57.070 --> 00:45:02.940
this goes to zero,
which means you cannot have any

00:45:02.940 --> 00:45:07.851
acceleration,
no matter how much force you

00:45:07.851 --> 00:45:10.267
apply.
And that's why you can't go

00:45:10.267 --> 00:45:12.969
faster than the speed of light.
Right?

00:45:12.969 --> 00:45:16.332
Because as you get closer and
closer to the speed of light,

00:45:16.332 --> 00:45:19.000
this gamma factor becomes
larger and larger.

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:21.750
That makes your mass larger and
larger.

00:45:21.750 --> 00:45:24.258
And then, to get a given amount
of acceleration,

00:45:24.258 --> 00:45:26.872
since this is huge,
you have to have an increasing

00:45:26.872 --> 00:45:29.726
amount of force.
By the time you get to the

00:45:29.726 --> 00:45:33.506
speed of light the mass
is--sorry, it's this whole thing

00:45:33.506 --> 00:45:37.327
that's zero, not the mass.
By the time you get to the

00:45:37.327 --> 00:45:40.490
speed of light,
you need an infinite amount of

00:45:40.490 --> 00:45:44.413
force to accelerate yourself.
So, you need an infinite amount

00:45:44.413 --> 00:45:48.098
of force in order to go faster.
And so, by the time you get out

00:45:48.098 --> 00:45:50.752
to the speed of light,
you can't go faster,

00:45:50.752 --> 00:45:54.164
because it would take an
infinite amount of force to do

00:45:54.164 --> 00:45:56.480
so.
Yes?

00:45:56.480 --> 00:45:58.022
Student: Does that mean
that when you're traveling the

00:45:58.022 --> 00:45:59.530
speed of light,
not only can you not speed up,

00:45:59.530 --> 00:46:01.563
but you also can't slow down,
since it would take force to

00:46:01.563 --> 00:46:02.777
slow you down?
Professor Charles

00:46:02.777 --> 00:46:04.296
Bailyn: That's right,
and what it really means,

00:46:04.296 --> 00:46:06.521
though,
is that nothing with a non-zero

00:46:06.521 --> 00:46:09.620
mass can actually ever get to
the speed of light.

00:46:09.620 --> 00:46:14.829
And therefore, what about light?
Light has zero mass.

00:46:14.829 --> 00:46:17.260
It has to, otherwise it can't
go at the speed of light.

00:46:17.260 --> 00:46:21.263
So if M_zero
is zero, then this whole thing

00:46:21.263 --> 00:46:25.091
applies in a very different way.
And so anything that goes at

00:46:25.091 --> 00:46:28.296
the speed of light has to be
massless, for just this kind of

00:46:28.296 --> 00:46:30.159
reason.
Yeah?

00:46:30.159 --> 00:46:33.958
Student: If light is
energy then doesn't it have a

00:46:33.958 --> 00:46:35.869
mass equivalent?
Professor Charles

00:46:35.869 --> 00:46:37.834
Bailyn: It has a mass
equivalent, but its rest mass is

00:46:37.834 --> 00:46:41.179
zero.
So, the reason it has energy is

00:46:41.179 --> 00:46:45.139
because you've got zero times
infinity.

00:46:45.139 --> 00:46:48.790
And so, if you slow light down,
then it disappears altogether.

00:46:48.790 --> 00:46:51.690
Right?
Because--if you slow light in a

00:46:51.690 --> 00:46:54.889
vacuum down, I should specify,
it disappears altogether,

00:46:54.889 --> 00:46:57.915
because if this isn't infinite
and this is zero,

00:46:57.915 --> 00:47:00.490
then you've got no mass energy
at all.

00:47:00.490 --> 00:47:03.918
Yes?
Student: If you can't

00:47:03.918 --> 00:47:06.605
accelerate or decelerate,
how do you get to your sort of

00:47:06.605 --> 00:47:08.288
intrinsic velocity?
Professor Charles

00:47:08.288 --> 00:47:09.780
Bailyn: Well,
what is an intrinsic velocity?

00:47:09.780 --> 00:47:12.110
This is where relativity
becomes relative.

00:47:12.110 --> 00:47:16.510
Depends on how fast the person
who's observing you is going.

00:47:16.510 --> 00:47:19.715
But remember,
this only applies if you're

00:47:19.715 --> 00:47:22.840
already moving at the speed of
light.

00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:25.031
If you're not moving at the
speed of light,

00:47:25.031 --> 00:47:28.081
then this isn't infinite.
You have some finite mass and

00:47:28.081 --> 00:47:31.649
you can change your velocity.
Remember, acceleration is a

00:47:31.649 --> 00:47:34.280
change in velocity by applying
force.

00:47:34.280 --> 00:47:37.406
And as long as the mass isn't
infinite, it just--you know,

00:47:37.406 --> 00:47:39.599
you calculate how much force it
takes.

00:47:39.599 --> 00:47:41.580
And that's how much it takes to
change your velocity.

00:47:45.190 --> 00:47:45.670
Other questions?

00:47:49.170 --> 00:47:54.145
Excellent questions all around.
This is not at all

00:47:54.145 --> 00:47:57.811
straightforward and we will
continue next time.
00:47:60

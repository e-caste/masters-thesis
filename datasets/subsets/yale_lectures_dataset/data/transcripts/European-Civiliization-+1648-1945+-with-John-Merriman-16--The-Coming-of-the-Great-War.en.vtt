00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:04.101
Prof: The second
announcement is the movies,

00:00:04.101 --> 00:00:04.750
the films.
 

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:08.590
I've done what I think is the
way to do it.

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:10.050
They will be available.
 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.190
I think the first one is
available now.

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:15.232
You can watch it in the privacy
of your rooms in whatever

00:00:15.232 --> 00:00:16.210
college you are.
 

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:20.420
You are to please see them.
 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.670
Paths of Glory goes with
next week.

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:25.810
That's the first one.
 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:27.580
It's very short and it's very
good.

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.130
It's one of the first Kubrick
films.

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.490
It's about the mutinies.
 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:33.630
I will talk about the mutinies
next week.

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.240
Please have seen the film by
Monday.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:42.040
Can you tell them in section
how they do that?

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.820
I did it, but I'm not sure how
I did it.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.500
They should be set up.
 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.393
Another thing you can do is you
can go down to Film Studies in

00:00:49.393 --> 00:00:52.623
the Whitney Humanities Center,
and you can check out the film

00:00:52.623 --> 00:00:54.833
and watch it there,
or I think you can take it

00:00:54.833 --> 00:00:55.490
back, also.
 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:57.400
But you can watch it on your
computer screens.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.500
Those are the three.
 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.039
The first one is the first one
and then the second one is the

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.590
second one.
 

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:05.790
Boy, I'm really awake today.
 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.704
The second one is Triumph of
the Will,

00:01:07.704 --> 00:01:09.489
which will go with the fascism
lecture.

00:01:09.489 --> 00:01:11.340
Be sure to have seen it before.
 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.004
The last one is Au revoir
les enfants,

00:01:15.004 --> 00:01:19.420
a Louis Malle film which will
be subtitled in English,

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:20.420
I think.
 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.010
Yes, it is.
 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:28.519
That goes with the second to
the last lecture.

00:01:28.519 --> 00:01:31.299
Make sure you've seen these
films.

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:34.262
None of them are long and
they're all great,

00:01:34.262 --> 00:01:37.224
great, great films,
if you can buy into Kirk

00:01:37.224 --> 00:01:39.430
Douglas as a French soldier.
 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.400
You have to suspend reality a
little bit to do that.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:44.920
Any announcements?
 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.019
Things happening?
 

00:01:46.019 --> 00:01:46.890
All right.
 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.319
Today, much of this lecture
just parallels the chapter.

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:55.926
The origins of World War I can
be confusing and I just want to

00:01:55.926 --> 00:02:00.230
make those perfectly clear so
that you know this stuff.

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:02.968
So, I hope you read the chapter.
 

00:02:02.968 --> 00:02:07.319
Also, we used to have you read
Goodbye to All That,

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:09.836
which is very long,
but very good,

00:02:09.836 --> 00:02:11.438
by Robert Graves.
 

00:02:11.438 --> 00:02:14.757
Then we used the inevitable
All Quiet on the Western

00:02:14.757 --> 00:02:17.030
Front, but we suppressed
those.

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.599
So, it's even more important
that you read the chapter.

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:23.538
Let me get into that.
 

00:02:23.538 --> 00:02:26.133
I'm not going to write all the
terms on the board,

00:02:26.133 --> 00:02:27.508
because there's so many.
 

00:02:27.508 --> 00:02:30.438
I sent them around,
and it's hard to see anyway.

00:02:30.438 --> 00:02:33.668
What I have up here is when I
talk about birthrights

00:02:33.668 --> 00:02:37.910
is--between the drilling in the
background, gosh darnit--anyway,

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.599
live births in 1908 were
thirteen per 1,000.

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:43.530
I'll go into that in a minute.
 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.759
Let me start now.
 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.419
Because World War I--in 1914 so
many people wanted war,

00:02:57.419 --> 00:03:00.545
and they ran to the Gare de
l'Est and chanted,

00:03:00.545 --> 00:03:02.770
"à
Berlin,

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:05.060
à Berlin,"
lots of champagne,

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.867
and then in Hauptbahnhof in
Berlin, they chanted,

00:03:08.867 --> 00:03:12.038
"nacht Paris,
nacht Paris."

00:03:12.038 --> 00:03:15.789
Nobody knew that the war was
going to last over four years,

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:20.663
and kill millions of people,
and mark the end of four

00:03:20.663 --> 00:03:23.688
empires, and,
arguably,

00:03:23.688 --> 00:03:26.598
help contribute to the end of
the fifth,

00:03:26.598 --> 00:03:29.438
that is the British Empire and
the impetus toward

00:03:29.438 --> 00:03:32.220
decolonization that comes out of
World War I.

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:37.675
Nobody knew that the war that
was supposed to be over by

00:03:37.675 --> 00:03:42.340
December wasn't going to be over
by December.

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.169
Outside of a couple of
journalists,

00:03:44.169 --> 00:03:47.973
who had been following the
Russo-Japanese War in Manchuria

00:03:47.973 --> 00:03:51.310
and had seen kind of the
evolution of trenches,

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.990
nobody predicted that kind of
war.

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:58.378
I'll talk about military
strategy at the end today,

00:03:58.378 --> 00:04:01.449
or--in the plans for the
war--or,

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:03.819
depending on time,
the timing,

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:07.258
at the beginning of next hour.
 

00:04:07.258 --> 00:04:12.150
So, this makes the origins of
the war so much more important.

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.900
There's certainly,
in terms of diplomatic history,

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.021
there's no other event in the
history of the world that has

00:04:18.021 --> 00:04:21.142
been so pored over than the
diplomatic origins of World War

00:04:21.142 --> 00:04:22.805
I,
the famous entangling

00:04:22.805 --> 00:04:24.992
alliances,
the house of cards that

00:04:24.992 --> 00:04:28.043
collapses,
all of those very familiar

00:04:28.043 --> 00:04:28.750
images.
 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.627
After the war,
I had this great uncle who

00:04:31.627 --> 00:04:34.649
fought in the war,
a great, great uncle.

00:04:34.649 --> 00:04:37.100
He was an old dude when I was a
very little guy.

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:40.800
He had been in France in 1917.
 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.355
At the end of the war,
I remember when I was a little

00:04:43.355 --> 00:04:46.110
kid he gave me this sort of
printed out book showing that

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:47.879
the Germans had started the war.
 

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:50.519
It was the official account of
the origins of World War I.

00:04:50.519 --> 00:04:53.709
Of course, the fact that at the
end of the war,

00:04:53.709 --> 00:04:57.040
the war ends with German troops
inside France.

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.149
This has a huge,
huge impact on what happens

00:05:00.149 --> 00:05:02.970
because of two things,
looking ahead.

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:06.610
One, it became very easy for
the German right to say,

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:08.569
"We weren't defeated.
 

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:10.310
We were stabbed in the
back."

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:11.170
By whom?
 

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:12.110
By the Jews.
 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:13.329
By the Communists.
 

00:05:13.329 --> 00:05:14.689
By the Socialists.
 

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:18.875
Secondly, because Germany was
defeated they had to sign on the

00:05:18.875 --> 00:05:22.305
bottom line saying,
"We started the war alone,

00:05:22.305 --> 00:05:23.610
we alone."
 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:28.740
The famous war guilt clause,
war guilt clause.

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:30.980
Now, the Germans didn't start
the war alone.

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:34.690
I'll leave it to you to decide
whether their responsibility,

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:37.389
the famous blank check given to
Austria-Hungary,

00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:40.850
is more important than the
roles of other states,

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:45.786
Russia declaring mobilization
which was tantamount to an act

00:05:45.786 --> 00:05:49.720
of war for reasons we'll come
to, or France,

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.089
for that matter.
 

00:05:51.089 --> 00:05:55.139
But that's why the origins of
World War I are so important.

00:05:55.139 --> 00:05:58.586
The other reason is that
clearly World War I unleashes

00:05:58.586 --> 00:06:01.060
the demons of the twentieth
century.

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:05.591
The kind of racist stuff,
the even somewhat genocidal

00:06:05.591 --> 00:06:09.079
stuff was out there in the
public domain,

00:06:09.079 --> 00:06:12.129
but World War I turns it loose.
 

00:06:12.129 --> 00:06:14.925
We talk about,
I hope convincingly,

00:06:14.925 --> 00:06:18.706
the Europe of extremes,
which is the title of a

00:06:18.706 --> 00:06:23.064
wonderful book by Eric Hobsbawm,
and one extreme being

00:06:23.064 --> 00:06:24.379
communism.
 

00:06:24.379 --> 00:06:26.420
But the other extreme,
which was more prenant,

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:30.214
more victorious,
more overwhelming in Europe was

00:06:30.214 --> 00:06:33.283
the rise of fascism and
particularly the rise of

00:06:33.283 --> 00:06:34.720
National Socialism.
 

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:38.882
This stuff was out there,
but National Socialism and the

00:06:38.882 --> 00:06:42.589
Nazis cannot be understood
without World War I.

00:06:42.589 --> 00:06:46.136
That's why this stuff on the
origins, this diplomatic history

00:06:46.136 --> 00:06:47.199
is so important.
 

00:06:47.199 --> 00:06:50.720
That's why I'm paralleling what
you are reading.

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:55.021
If you asked people in the
1880s and 1890s,

00:06:55.021 --> 00:06:59.629
"Who will fight in the
next war?"

00:06:59.629 --> 00:07:04.595
most people in Germany and many
people in France would say that

00:07:04.595 --> 00:07:08.600
"it'll be the Germans
fighting the French,

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.569
because of
Alsace-Lorraine."

00:07:10.569 --> 00:07:11.932
Other people,
as we'll see,

00:07:11.932 --> 00:07:14.449
particularly in the 1890s,
will say, "No.

00:07:14.449 --> 00:07:17.454
It's the British and the French
who are going to be fighting,

00:07:17.454 --> 00:07:19.408
colonial rivalries,
Fashoda and all that

00:07:19.408 --> 00:07:20.360
business."
 

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:25.000
But the one in what you're
reading, as I put it,

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.942
the old hatred that cannot be
put offstage during the entire

00:07:30.942 --> 00:07:33.791
period,
even when French and British

00:07:33.791 --> 00:07:36.740
relations are at their nadir,
at their worst,

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:43.069
is that between Germany united,
the empire proclaimed in the

00:07:43.069 --> 00:07:47.745
Hall of Mirrors at Versailles,
the Chateau de Versailles,

00:07:47.745 --> 00:07:51.129
and France, because,
after all,

00:07:51.129 --> 00:07:55.449
the French had to give the
second-most industrialized

00:07:55.449 --> 00:07:57.932
region,
one of the most prosperous

00:07:57.932 --> 00:08:01.560
regions that is Alsace and much
of Lorraine, to Germany.

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:04.454
I'm going to end up with an
incident that looked like war

00:08:04.454 --> 00:08:07.660
was possibly going to break out
between Germany and France,

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:12.079
that is the Saverne incident,
and talk a little bit about

00:08:12.079 --> 00:08:14.720
Alsace-Lorraine and stuff that
isn't in the book later,

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:17.339
just to make it clear.
 

00:08:17.339 --> 00:08:20.300
It is complicated,
because the French could never

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:24.370
accept the fact that Alsace and
much of Lorraine was now German.

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:26.410
This is, again,
remember we talked about

00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:28.449
nationalism and constructed
identity?

00:08:28.449 --> 00:08:32.118
Most people in Alsace and in
those parts of Lorraine that

00:08:32.118 --> 00:08:35.393
became part of the Second Reich,
the Second Empire,

00:08:35.393 --> 00:08:36.899
what do they speak?
 

00:08:36.899 --> 00:08:38.419
They spoke German dialect.
 

00:08:38.419 --> 00:08:40.190
They did not speak French.
 

00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:41.750
More about that later.
 

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:43.860
There was bilingualism,
but that's interesting.

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:46.279
If you asked them,
"What nationality are

00:08:46.279 --> 00:08:46.940
you?"
 

00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:50.298
and they reply in German,
"I am French."

00:08:50.298 --> 00:08:53.621
If you were somebody doing a
survey now, you'd be sort of

00:08:53.621 --> 00:08:54.690
shocked by that.
 

00:08:54.690 --> 00:08:58.370
But these are complex,
these identities.

00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:04.988
Anyway, the rivalry between
France and Germany was already

00:09:04.988 --> 00:09:06.730
always there.
 

00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:10.940
If you went to the Place de la
Concorde in Paris,

00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:14.629
the Statue of Strasbourg,
the town of Strasbourg,

00:09:14.629 --> 00:09:20.629
which is an important European
capital now of the new Europe,

00:09:20.629 --> 00:09:23.485
for better or for worse,
was covered in mourning cloth

00:09:23.485 --> 00:09:25.998
for much of the period because
it had been

00:09:25.998 --> 00:09:27.529
"amputated."
 

00:09:27.529 --> 00:09:29.649
They used this image often.
 

00:09:29.649 --> 00:09:36.019
The right arm of France had
been amputated in the settlement

00:09:36.019 --> 00:09:39.259
after the Franco-German War.
 

00:09:39.259 --> 00:09:42.860
So, that rivalry is there.
 

00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:47.349
French military planners,
right through the whole period

00:09:47.349 --> 00:09:51.577
at the time of Boulanger,
who was one who built his

00:09:51.577 --> 00:09:55.794
reputation--you already read
about the general Georges

00:09:55.794 --> 00:09:58.500
Boulanger--he is Mr. Revenge.
 

00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:02.326
Military planners said,
"When the war comes,

00:10:02.326 --> 00:10:06.474
we will move into Alsace and
take Alsace and parts of

00:10:06.474 --> 00:10:07.909
Lorraine back.
 

00:10:07.909 --> 00:10:09.720
Then we will move to Berlin.
 

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:11.428
Simple, just like that."
 

00:10:11.428 --> 00:10:14.325
To the very end,
that's their military strategy,

00:10:14.325 --> 00:10:14.879
attack.
 

00:10:14.879 --> 00:10:17.798
They're going to attack and get
back Alsace-Lorraine.

00:10:17.798 --> 00:10:21.652
What the Germans plan to do has
a lot to do with the way the war

00:10:21.652 --> 00:10:23.610
starts, and we will get there.
 

00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:30.043
The second big rivalry in
Europe--and again think of the

00:10:30.043 --> 00:10:34.019
28^(th) of June 1914,
Sarajevo,

00:10:34.019 --> 00:10:37.777
a sixteen-year-old
heavily-armed Gavrilo

00:10:37.777 --> 00:10:42.980
Princip--is that between Russia
and Austria-Hungary.

00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:48.053
Their rivalry is over the South
Slavs who are within the

00:10:48.053 --> 00:10:51.929
Austria-Hungarian Empire and the
Serbs,

00:10:51.929 --> 00:10:56.303
who are not,
but who provide a constant

00:10:56.303 --> 00:11:01.669
force for destabilization in the
region.

00:11:01.669 --> 00:11:04.227
As you know,
since the time of Catherine the

00:11:04.227 --> 00:11:07.320
Great,
she set her eyes on Istanbul,

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:10.750
Constantinople--they're the
same city--on the straits,

00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:15.917
on access to the Black Sea,
that there was always going to

00:11:15.917 --> 00:11:20.100
be this drive of Russia to the
straits.

00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:22.956
As you know,
later Turkey allies with

00:11:22.956 --> 00:11:23.750
Germany.
 

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:29.679
But the big rivalry is in terms
of Russian influence,

00:11:29.679 --> 00:11:33.139
destabilizing influence,
seeing itself as the protector,

00:11:33.139 --> 00:11:35.850
the mother of all of the Slav
peoples,

00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:38.692
is a permanent force of
destabilization in the

00:11:38.692 --> 00:11:40.272
Austria-Hungarian Empire.
 

00:11:40.272 --> 00:11:42.753
Ironically,
the guy who gets offed along

00:11:42.753 --> 00:11:45.452
with his wife,
the Archduke Franz Ferdinand

00:11:45.452 --> 00:11:49.965
and his wife,
he was one of the more--he was

00:11:49.965 --> 00:11:54.090
a prejudiced figure in many
ways,

00:11:54.090 --> 00:11:55.678
but he was considered a
moderate,

00:11:55.678 --> 00:12:01.328
because he believed that the
South Slavs should have kind of

00:12:01.328 --> 00:12:04.009
a third status,
possibly,

00:12:04.009 --> 00:12:13.802
along with Austria and Hungary
within sort of a tripartite

00:12:13.802 --> 00:12:15.350
empire.
 

00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:19.873
Of course, he gets gunned down
and what comes next is the blank

00:12:19.873 --> 00:12:21.610
check,
where the Germans say,

00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:24.509
"Do what you want to
settle this situation."

00:12:24.509 --> 00:12:29.710
And the famous ultimatum to
Serbia by Austria-Hungary.

00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:34.794
The Russian government stirs up
pan-Slavic fervor in the

00:12:34.794 --> 00:12:35.720
Balkans.
 

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:40.019
They work consistently to do
that.

00:12:40.019 --> 00:12:44.440
There are religious ties,
the Orthodox religion.

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:49.461
There are ties of alphabet,
the Cyrillic alphabet used in

00:12:49.461 --> 00:12:50.269
Serbia.
 

00:12:50.269 --> 00:12:52.730
Serbo-Croatian is the same
spoken language,

00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:55.806
although Serb friends and
Croatian friends would deny that

00:12:55.806 --> 00:12:57.768
in some ways,
but basically it's the same

00:12:57.768 --> 00:12:58.460
spoken language.
 

00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:02.958
But the Serbs use Cyrillic
alphabet, which is what the

00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:05.336
Russians use,
and the Croats,

00:13:05.336 --> 00:13:08.817
who are Catholic,
use the alphabet used in

00:13:08.817 --> 00:13:10.600
Western Europe.
 

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:16.049
So, the European alliance
system,

00:13:16.049 --> 00:13:20.812
these entangling alliances,
hinges on French and German

00:13:20.812 --> 00:13:25.846
enmity and the competing
interests of Russia and

00:13:25.846 --> 00:13:29.490
Austria-Hungary in the Balkans.
 

00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:35.317
It also hinges on Bismarck,
who was in many ways an odious

00:13:35.317 --> 00:13:38.178
guy but a very clever guy.
 

00:13:38.178 --> 00:13:43.481
His fear was that Germany would
have to fight a war on two

00:13:43.481 --> 00:13:44.320
fronts.
 

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:48.080
So, what these powers are doing
are looking for allies.

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:50.758
As Bismarck said,
it's interesting he said it in

00:13:50.758 --> 00:13:53.778
French, showing that in many
ways French was still the

00:13:53.778 --> 00:13:55.259
language of diplomacy.
 

00:13:55.259 --> 00:13:58.611
He said when you've got these
great powers,

00:13:58.611 --> 00:14:01.245
five of them,
"you have to be

00:14:01.245 --> 00:14:03.798
à trois."
 

00:14:03.798 --> 00:14:08.580
You have to be with the three
and not the two.

00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:12.446
His worst nightmare--and
Bismarck was somebody who said

00:14:12.446 --> 00:14:16.599
he liked to lie awake at night
and hate--his worst fear was

00:14:16.599 --> 00:14:20.966
having to fight the Russians and
having to fight the French at

00:14:20.966 --> 00:14:22.399
the same time.
 

00:14:22.399 --> 00:14:25.910
When he encourages the French
to get into the imperial game at

00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:28.865
the beginning,
he's doing that to try to get

00:14:28.865 --> 00:14:32.480
them to blow off a little steam
out there in Africa.

00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:36.677
"My map of Africa is
here," remember the line of

00:14:36.677 --> 00:14:38.149
the map of Europe.
 

00:14:38.149 --> 00:14:41.480
So, as he said,
here's the exact quote,

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:43.366
"All international
politics reduces itself to this

00:14:43.366 --> 00:14:45.080
formula: try to be à
trois."

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:48.514
As long as the world is
governed by the unstable

00:14:48.514 --> 00:14:51.509
equilibrium of five great
powers--Germany,

00:14:51.509 --> 00:14:53.846
Austria-Hungary,
Russia, Britain,

00:14:53.846 --> 00:14:55.090
and France.
 

00:14:55.090 --> 00:15:00.418
These treaties,
the arrangements--that is,

00:15:00.418 --> 00:15:04.556
the emergence of the triple
alliance and the emergence of

00:15:04.556 --> 00:15:07.879
the triple entente at the time
of the war,

00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:18.009
Italy is up for grabs,
open to the highest bidder.

00:15:18.009 --> 00:15:20.605
Italy will go to war,
despite having been a member

00:15:20.605 --> 00:15:23.889
originally of the alliance with
Austria-Hungary and Germany.

00:15:23.889 --> 00:15:28.086
It will go to war on the allied
side, because the allies promise

00:15:28.086 --> 00:15:29.419
them more in 1915.
 

00:15:29.419 --> 00:15:31.899
But that's another story.
 

00:15:31.899 --> 00:15:34.565
But that's very important in
the emergence of fascism in

00:15:34.565 --> 00:15:37.035
Italy, because Italy after the
war, though nominally

00:15:37.035 --> 00:15:39.120
victorious, does not get what it
wants.

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:41.450
It does not get the Dalmatian
Coast.

00:15:41.450 --> 00:15:44.320
It does not get the Tyrol
mountains.

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:47.056
If you fought a war based on
national claims,

00:15:47.056 --> 00:15:50.041
why turn around and give
regions that have only a

00:15:50.041 --> 00:15:52.840
minority of Italian populations
to Italy?

00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:57.019
Benito Mussolini goes from
being a socialist to being a

00:15:57.019 --> 00:16:01.894
fascist, helps create that party
based upon this idea that Italy

00:16:01.894 --> 00:16:03.519
had been screwed.
 

00:16:03.519 --> 00:16:06.298
They never got what they were
supposed to in World War I.

00:16:06.298 --> 00:16:11.302
So, he comes power as a
fascist, as you know,

00:16:11.302 --> 00:16:12.440
in 1922.
 

00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:17.511
In 1879 Bismarck forges this
cornerstone alliance between

00:16:17.511 --> 00:16:22.976
Germany and Austria-Hungary,
and it's predicated on German

00:16:22.976 --> 00:16:28.293
support for Habsburg opposition
to the expansion of Russian

00:16:28.293 --> 00:16:30.860
interests in the Balkans.
 

00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:37.034
You can see in this the origins
of the famous blank check in the

00:16:37.034 --> 00:16:40.269
hot summer, as it was,
in 1914.

00:16:40.269 --> 00:16:43.542
In 1880 Italy allies with
Germany and Austria-Hungary

00:16:43.542 --> 00:16:45.428
forming the triple alliance.
 

00:16:45.428 --> 00:16:50.227
But the wording is such that it
doesn't necessarily bring Italy

00:16:50.227 --> 00:16:51.389
into the war.
 

00:16:51.389 --> 00:16:56.557
As I said, Italy will come in
on the side of Austria-Hungary

00:16:56.557 --> 00:17:00.587
and Germany and Italy comes in,
as I just said,

00:17:00.587 --> 00:17:01.639
in 1915.
 

00:17:01.639 --> 00:17:04.298
Now, the details of these
treaties,

00:17:04.298 --> 00:17:07.307
and these diplomats are still
under the influence of

00:17:07.307 --> 00:17:10.539
Metternich and all that,
but the details are not known,

00:17:10.539 --> 00:17:13.910
but the outlines are known.
 

00:17:13.910 --> 00:17:20.136
The details are not known but
the outlines of these treaties

00:17:20.136 --> 00:17:22.460
are basically known.
 

00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:27.143
One seam right through the
period is every time that Russia

00:17:27.143 --> 00:17:31.019
seeks to expand its influence in
the Balkans,

00:17:31.019 --> 00:17:36.009
Austria-Hungary gets concerned
and they turn to Germany saying,

00:17:36.009 --> 00:17:37.900
"You will back us.
 

00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:39.180
You will back us,
won't you?"

00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:40.578
They say, "Yes,
of course, we will back

00:17:40.578 --> 00:17:40.970
you."
 

00:17:40.970 --> 00:17:44.683
In the end what happens is that
the blank check goes,

00:17:44.683 --> 00:17:48.400
after the ultimatum,
to Serbia by Austria-Hungary.

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:52.000
"Do whatever you want to
settle this situation.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.230
We will back you all the
way."

00:17:54.230 --> 00:18:00.557
Why does Germany become
encircled diplomatically and

00:18:00.557 --> 00:18:03.038
ultimately in war?
 

00:18:03.038 --> 00:18:10.065
How does it happen that Russia,
czarist autocratic Russia

00:18:10.065 --> 00:18:14.078
allies with republican France?
 

00:18:14.078 --> 00:18:17.217
That the czar,
the oppressor of the

00:18:17.217 --> 00:18:22.980
non-Russian peoples,
especially the Jews in Russia,

00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:27.214
comes to Paris in 1889 and they
name a beautiful bridge after

00:18:27.214 --> 00:18:29.460
him,
the Pont Alexandre III,

00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:31.368
the bridge of Alexander III.
 

00:18:31.368 --> 00:18:37.904
The marine band learns the
theme song of the czars and the

00:18:37.904 --> 00:18:41.460
socialists go wild in France.
 

00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:44.256
How can you ally with these
people who are repressing

00:18:44.256 --> 00:18:45.713
socialists,
who are repressing

00:18:45.713 --> 00:18:47.740
nationalities,
they're repressing everybody,

00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:50.529
and run this police state?
 

00:18:50.529 --> 00:18:55.420
So, the last thing that
Bismarck wanted are these two

00:18:55.420 --> 00:19:00.309
big states to come together on
either side of him.

00:19:00.309 --> 00:19:01.759
How does this happen?
 

00:19:01.759 --> 00:19:06.520
Both France and Russia are
outside of the triple alliance,

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:08.609
which you already know.
 

00:19:08.609 --> 00:19:10.359
But there's another reason.
 

00:19:10.359 --> 00:19:14.093
As a matter of fact,
I read about four or five years

00:19:14.093 --> 00:19:17.752
ago there are still French
companies trying to get their

00:19:17.752 --> 00:19:22.078
money back from Russia because
they lost their money in 1917,

00:19:22.078 --> 00:19:26.645
when the Bolsheviks came to
power and ultimately

00:19:26.645 --> 00:19:30.710
nationalized industries,
big industries particularly.

00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:34.891
It is economic in that one of
the old things the people say

00:19:34.891 --> 00:19:37.960
about the French economy,
but it's still true,

00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:41.558
is that French money
investments,

00:19:41.558 --> 00:19:44.470
much of it goes outside of
France.

00:19:44.470 --> 00:19:49.089
They build the railroads in
Spain, but they invest heavily

00:19:49.089 --> 00:19:52.900
in Russian industry and in
Russian railroads.

00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:58.279
So, these economic ties are
very important.

00:19:58.279 --> 00:19:59.980
There are also cultural ties.
 

00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:03.991
Because of the popularity of
the French in aristocratic

00:20:03.991 --> 00:20:06.598
circles within Russia,
but on the other hand,

00:20:06.598 --> 00:20:08.509
there were lots of Russian
nobles who spoke German,

00:20:08.509 --> 00:20:12.865
who lived in Konigsberg,
which is still this sort of

00:20:12.865 --> 00:20:15.440
enclave now that is still part
of Russia,

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:19.068
sort of stuck between Poland
and Lithuania.

00:20:19.068 --> 00:20:22.799
But the most important reason
is that French investment in

00:20:22.799 --> 00:20:26.400
Russia increases dramatically in
the 1880s and 1890s.

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:33.340
And that France seeks an ally
against Germany and that

00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:38.579
relations between Russia and
Germany,

00:20:38.579 --> 00:20:41.670
and this is already obvious,
you've already discerned this,

00:20:41.670 --> 00:20:46.189
are going to deteriorate
because of this tender

00:20:46.189 --> 00:20:51.298
relationship between
Austria-Hungary and Germany over

00:20:51.298 --> 00:20:52.869
the Balkans.
 

00:20:52.869 --> 00:20:57.589
In the very end,
one of the ludicrous aspects of

00:20:57.589 --> 00:21:00.768
this whole damn thing is that
just as they're about to go to

00:21:00.768 --> 00:21:04.068
war,
and just as Czar Nicholas II,

00:21:04.068 --> 00:21:06.150
about whom we'll come back and
discuss one day,

00:21:06.150 --> 00:21:09.868
he signs the mobilization order.
 

00:21:09.868 --> 00:21:12.330
And mobilization,
for reasons I'll come back to,

00:21:12.330 --> 00:21:14.058
is tantamount to an act of war.
 

00:21:14.058 --> 00:21:19.269
He's dashing off letters to his
dearest cousin Willie.

00:21:19.269 --> 00:21:21.773
And Willie is writing back to
"My Dear Cousin

00:21:21.773 --> 00:21:22.490
Nicky."
 

00:21:22.490 --> 00:21:24.269
These people are related.
 

00:21:24.269 --> 00:21:25.259
They're cousins.
 

00:21:25.259 --> 00:21:28.828
But international
circumstances,

00:21:28.828 --> 00:21:30.710
and the tensions over the
Balkans,

00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:36.785
and French fears of Germany,
bring Russia and France

00:21:36.785 --> 00:21:42.415
together and the French marine
band plays whatever the theme

00:21:42.415 --> 00:21:47.569
song of the Russia czars is--it
certainly wasn't Doctor

00:21:47.569 --> 00:21:50.720
Zhivago--;when they arrived.
 

00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:55.757
For the Russian government that
blames Austria-Hungary for

00:21:55.757 --> 00:22:00.971
trying to undercut what they
view as their logical influence

00:22:00.971 --> 00:22:06.721
in the Balkans,
and Germany will back them

00:22:06.721 --> 00:22:08.558
right away.
 

00:22:08.558 --> 00:22:13.534
In 1892 France and Russia sign
a military treaty that says that

00:22:13.534 --> 00:22:18.348
there'll be a military response
if the other were attacked by

00:22:18.348 --> 00:22:21.880
Germany or by one or more of its
allies.

00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:26.519
They form a formal alliance in
1894.

00:22:26.519 --> 00:22:28.720
What about Britain?
 

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:31.670
What about Britain?
 

00:22:31.670 --> 00:22:36.632
One of the things is that the
British don't want to ally with

00:22:36.632 --> 00:22:37.460
anybody.
 

00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:40.710
They're on bad terms with the
French and they're on bad terms

00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:43.309
with the Russians,
to make a long story short.

00:22:43.309 --> 00:22:45.480
The Great Game,
as they called it,

00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:50.759
rivalry over Afghanistan,
over the entire sort of

00:22:50.759 --> 00:22:56.048
extension of that frontier into
Asia,

00:22:56.048 --> 00:23:05.680
means that the chances of Great
Britain joining in alliance with

00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:12.558
Russia and with France seems
extremely dim.

00:23:12.558 --> 00:23:16.630
Britain wants to control the
seas and to go it alone.

00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:21.058
But they discover a fact that
shouldn't have surprised them in

00:23:21.058 --> 00:23:23.309
the Boer War in South Africa.
 

00:23:23.309 --> 00:23:24.970
They don't have any friends.
 

00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:29.108
Nobody supports what they're
doing in South Africa.

00:23:29.108 --> 00:23:33.558
It's better to have an ally in
a world that gets increasingly

00:23:33.558 --> 00:23:34.450
dangerous.
 

00:23:34.450 --> 00:23:41.690
What happens gradually is that
the rivalry,

00:23:41.690 --> 00:23:46.410
again to make a long story
short,

00:23:46.410 --> 00:23:52.113
between Germany and Britain
ultimately will cause Britain to

00:23:52.113 --> 00:23:56.755
look for allies,
and that suddenly it seems less

00:23:56.755 --> 00:24:01.190
probable that France and Britain
will go to war.

00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:06.611
What is the nature of this
increasingly bitter rivalry

00:24:06.611 --> 00:24:09.680
between Germany and Britain?
 

00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:12.990
One is obvious--Africa.
 

00:24:12.990 --> 00:24:14.940
That's one.
 

00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:21.636
Second, economic in that the
German economy is growing by

00:24:21.636 --> 00:24:23.910
leaps and bounds.
 

00:24:23.910 --> 00:24:28.029
It is the number one country in
chemistry.

00:24:28.029 --> 00:24:32.269
Those of you that are chemists,
the whole university system--in

00:24:32.269 --> 00:24:36.019
Britain the university system
isn't terribly practical,

00:24:36.019 --> 00:24:40.156
but in Germany chemistry is
part of what they do in the

00:24:40.156 --> 00:24:43.230
German universities,
which are great universities.

00:24:43.230 --> 00:24:47.192
They began to lap the British
in chemistry,

00:24:47.192 --> 00:24:52.096
chemical productions,
and they catch up and go ahead,

00:24:52.096 --> 00:24:53.890
and steel, too.
 

00:24:53.890 --> 00:24:57.250
This is a big rivalry.
 

00:24:57.250 --> 00:25:02.746
The British government begins
to run scared because the City

00:25:02.746 --> 00:25:04.608
is running scared.
 

00:25:04.608 --> 00:25:07.457
Third is this famous naval
rivalry, about which Paul

00:25:07.457 --> 00:25:10.305
Kennedy, my colleague and friend
has written a book,

00:25:10.305 --> 00:25:12.650
The Anglo-German Naval
Rivalry.

00:25:12.650 --> 00:25:17.210
The Germans start turning out
these huge ships.

00:25:17.210 --> 00:25:20.680
Then the British respond.
 

00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:23.909
They produce the Dreadnaught,
which becomes a symbol for

00:25:23.909 --> 00:25:27.549
these huge powerful battleships
like nothing that had ever been

00:25:27.549 --> 00:25:28.490
seen before.
 

00:25:28.490 --> 00:25:35.210
The naval leagues in both
countries--again,

00:25:35.210 --> 00:25:36.598
this is a culture of
imperialism,

00:25:36.598 --> 00:25:40.977
the culture of aggressive
nationalism--put huge pressure

00:25:40.977 --> 00:25:45.273
on governments to throw every
available resource in the

00:25:45.273 --> 00:25:48.140
building of more and more ships.
 

00:25:48.140 --> 00:25:53.128
Britain, which had always
basically controlled the seas

00:25:53.128 --> 00:25:58.580
since the defeat of the Spanish
Armada in the late sixteenth

00:25:58.580 --> 00:25:59.690
century.
 

00:25:59.690 --> 00:26:01.098
They're running scared.
 

00:26:01.098 --> 00:26:03.875
Now, again, you can't look
ahead and say,

00:26:03.875 --> 00:26:04.710
"Aha!
 

00:26:04.710 --> 00:26:08.291
But there was only one naval
battle of any consequence in

00:26:08.291 --> 00:26:11.617
World War I at the Battle of
Jutland off the coast of

00:26:11.617 --> 00:26:12.769
Denmark."
 

00:26:12.769 --> 00:26:15.094
It's kind of a draw,
but basically the Germans are

00:26:15.094 --> 00:26:17.038
forced back in their port so
they lose.

00:26:17.038 --> 00:26:18.660
But the British couldn't
anticipate that.

00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:23.859
So, their fear of Germany and
the saber rattling of the

00:26:23.859 --> 00:26:28.288
thoroughly irresponsible idiot,
Wilhelm II,

00:26:28.288 --> 00:26:33.086
helps make it possible to
imagine an alliance with

00:26:33.086 --> 00:26:36.220
"the sneaky French."
 

00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:42.450
In the 1890s there were a lot
of war novels about future wars.

00:26:42.450 --> 00:26:44.791
This, in itself,
reflects the fact that many

00:26:44.791 --> 00:26:47.190
people thought there would be
another war.

00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:49.325
Again, they didn't know it was
going to be a war of four and a

00:26:49.325 --> 00:26:51.460
half years, but they think
there's going to be another war.

00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:54.880
I assure you I've never read
the following book.

00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:59.925
But one of the more successful
was, for a brief time,

00:26:59.925 --> 00:27:04.098
was this sort of book about a
future war.

00:27:04.098 --> 00:27:08.553
I guess it's in the early
1890s, or about the time of

00:27:08.553 --> 00:27:09.410
Fashoda.
 

00:27:09.410 --> 00:27:11.895
It's in the 1890s,
or maybe the first couple of

00:27:11.895 --> 00:27:13.680
years of the twentieth century.
 

00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:14.690
It doesn't matter.
 

00:27:14.690 --> 00:27:20.516
Dover, the middle class of
Dover are out parading around in

00:27:20.516 --> 00:27:25.538
the rain on a Sunday morning,
miserable weather.

00:27:25.538 --> 00:27:30.847
They suddenly find that Dover's
been taken over by the sneaky

00:27:30.847 --> 00:27:35.359
French, that they've been
digging a tunnel under the

00:27:35.359 --> 00:27:37.130
English Channel.
 

00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:41.769
Napoleon wanted to dig a tunnel
under the Channel.

00:27:41.769 --> 00:27:44.311
There is a tunnel under the
English Channel,

00:27:44.311 --> 00:27:45.140
the Chunnel.
 

00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:47.507
The trains rocket along,
at least until they get to

00:27:47.507 --> 00:27:49.401
Britain and then they sort of
plod along at about two

00:27:49.401 --> 00:27:51.876
kilometers an hour,
but they've improved that side

00:27:51.876 --> 00:27:52.259
of it.
 

00:27:52.259 --> 00:27:54.920
Anyway, there's sort of a
French bias, but too bad.

00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:58.303
They suddenly find,
as they're strolling along in

00:27:58.303 --> 00:28:00.911
the pouring rain,
the horizontal rain,

00:28:00.911 --> 00:28:04.930
that the sneaky French,
there were soldiers all over.

00:28:04.930 --> 00:28:09.199
Taking these sort of national
stereotypes, the French are

00:28:09.199 --> 00:28:13.240
disguised as waiters wearing
dirty waiter uniforms.

00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:16.298
This is the British image.
 

00:28:16.298 --> 00:28:19.511
I wouldn't even comment on what
English kitchens would have been

00:28:19.511 --> 00:28:19.869
like.
 

00:28:19.869 --> 00:28:21.650
That would be a cheap shot.
 

00:28:21.650 --> 00:28:26.819
But under these towels were
sneaky weapons.

00:28:26.819 --> 00:28:29.390
They take over Dover.
 

00:28:29.390 --> 00:28:33.726
Then, of course,
the British get it together and

00:28:33.726 --> 00:28:36.390
they drive them back into the
tunnel,

00:28:36.390 --> 00:28:38.795
and shoot a few,
and then they cement up the

00:28:38.795 --> 00:28:42.555
tunnel,
and then parliament passes more

00:28:42.555 --> 00:28:45.849
battleship bills,
etc., etc.,

00:28:45.849 --> 00:28:47.450
the future novel.
 

00:28:47.450 --> 00:28:50.660
But there's another one four or
five years later.

00:28:50.660 --> 00:28:52.505
I haven't read this one,
either, and I'm not going to

00:28:52.505 --> 00:28:52.858
read it.
 

00:28:52.858 --> 00:28:56.970
The people in Whitby or
Scarborough,

00:28:56.970 --> 00:29:01.828
speaking of horizontal rain in
the east coast,

00:29:01.828 --> 00:29:05.180
they wake up and they see these
huge German battleships just

00:29:05.180 --> 00:29:08.019
lobbing shells that can reach
and blow up York,

00:29:08.019 --> 00:29:10.650
lobbing one shell after another.
 

00:29:10.650 --> 00:29:13.140
The sequel isn't very
interesting, but the British

00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:14.970
parliament passes even more
bills.

00:29:14.970 --> 00:29:18.124
Then the battleships of the
"good guys"

00:29:18.124 --> 00:29:21.410
go and blow up the battleships
of the bad guys,

00:29:21.410 --> 00:29:25.484
and everybody can go back to
eating odd things on a Sunday

00:29:25.484 --> 00:29:26.200
morning.
 

00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:31.906
So, how does it happen that
that scenario is reversed,

00:29:31.906 --> 00:29:35.029
of what the future will be?
 

00:29:35.029 --> 00:29:36.338
I've just explained it.
 

00:29:36.338 --> 00:29:45.130
It has to do with the fears of
both of these states of Germany.

00:29:45.130 --> 00:29:49.667
And that the crises,
which you can read about,

00:29:49.667 --> 00:29:55.518
the Moroccan crisis in 1905
makes even firmer this military

00:29:55.518 --> 00:29:56.828
alliance.
 

00:29:56.828 --> 00:29:59.807
It's called an entente,
that word is in English,

00:29:59.807 --> 00:30:03.058
too, or an understanding,
but basically it's an alliance.

00:30:03.058 --> 00:30:05.960
By 1905 they're already saying,
"Look, our navy,

00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:07.992
the British Navy will take care
of the North Sea and the

00:30:07.992 --> 00:30:09.779
Channel,
and you guys take care of the

00:30:09.779 --> 00:30:10.778
Mediterranean."
 

00:30:10.778 --> 00:30:15.161
The crisis in 1911,
the second Moroccan crisis,

00:30:15.161 --> 00:30:19.352
which pushes Germany and France
close to war,

00:30:19.352 --> 00:30:24.210
affirms all of the above things
that I've said.

00:30:24.210 --> 00:30:29.109
Don't get the idea that in 1911
things are more dangerous than

00:30:29.109 --> 00:30:33.608
1910, and in 1910 they're more
dangerous than in 1909.

00:30:33.608 --> 00:30:36.769
Again, this sort of hydraulic
model of pressure building up

00:30:36.769 --> 00:30:38.240
and finally there is war.
 

00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:39.368
It doesn't work like that.
 

00:30:39.368 --> 00:30:42.470
These alliances become firmed
up.

00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:53.308
Of these great powers that
Britain, and France,

00:30:53.308 --> 00:30:57.868
and Russia end up in--Bismarck
was dead by then,

00:30:57.868 --> 00:31:01.915
but in his worst nightmare of
being à

00:31:01.915 --> 00:31:04.160
trois,
of being three.

00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:10.888
The French, by the way,
had another reason to be

00:31:10.888 --> 00:31:16.759
particularly eager to have an
alliance.

00:31:16.759 --> 00:31:21.854
An odd thing happens in la
belle France,

00:31:21.854 --> 00:31:24.068
in most of France.
 

00:31:24.068 --> 00:31:26.839
The French population stops
growing.

00:31:26.839 --> 00:31:31.670
It just stops as of 1846-1847.
 

00:31:31.670 --> 00:31:33.779
It's regionally specific.
 

00:31:33.779 --> 00:31:37.406
In Brittany and in the
Auvergne, in the center of

00:31:37.406 --> 00:31:40.960
France, people are still
churning out babies.

00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:43.250
You still have huge families.
 

00:31:43.250 --> 00:31:45.319
We have friends,
one of them just died,

00:31:45.319 --> 00:31:47.608
older people,
and they grew up in misery in

00:31:47.608 --> 00:31:48.589
the mountains.
 

00:31:48.589 --> 00:31:49.808
Misery.
 

00:31:49.808 --> 00:31:51.640
They had thirteen children and
twelve children.

00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:53.808
They were one of twelve or
thirteen children.

00:31:53.808 --> 00:31:57.558
But in most of France that's
not the case.

00:31:57.558 --> 00:32:00.551
In one part of southwestern
France, when people had a second

00:32:00.551 --> 00:32:02.529
baby they received a condolence
card.

00:32:02.529 --> 00:32:04.259
Isn't that bizarre?
 

00:32:04.259 --> 00:32:06.829
The French population stops
growing.

00:32:06.829 --> 00:32:08.529
Why?
 

00:32:08.529 --> 00:32:10.180
There are a couple of reasons.
 

00:32:10.180 --> 00:32:12.048
This is just an aside,
but it's interesting.

00:32:12.048 --> 00:32:15.012
The Napoleonic Code,
remember, ends primogeniture,

00:32:15.012 --> 00:32:18.642
so you've got to divide up the
plot of land into two or three

00:32:18.642 --> 00:32:19.609
or into two.
 

00:32:19.609 --> 00:32:21.710
Birth control.
 

00:32:21.710 --> 00:32:24.651
There are two arguments:
the peasants start it and then

00:32:24.651 --> 00:32:27.646
it filters up to the middle
classes, or the middle class

00:32:27.646 --> 00:32:29.500
starts it and it filters down.
 

00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:31.059
It depends on where you are in
France.

00:32:31.059 --> 00:32:33.880
But they stop having children.
 

00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:36.108
Look at this.
 

00:32:36.108 --> 00:32:37.941
I wrote it on the board,
and it may be in the book,

00:32:37.941 --> 00:32:38.818
I don't even remember.
 

00:32:38.818 --> 00:32:46.115
Here are live births,
1908-1913 per thousand:

00:32:46.115 --> 00:32:52.416
Italy 32.4, Austria 31.9,
Germany 29.3,

00:32:52.416 --> 00:32:59.049
England 24.9,
USA 24.3, France 19.5.

00:32:59.049 --> 00:33:00.868
That is so low.
 

00:33:00.868 --> 00:33:03.347
The French population would
have literally not grown had it

00:33:03.347 --> 00:33:04.460
not been for immigrants.
 

00:33:04.460 --> 00:33:07.789
Immigrants then were people
coming from Italy and from

00:33:07.789 --> 00:33:10.932
Switzerland, but mostly from
Italy, and from Spain,

00:33:10.932 --> 00:33:12.630
some, and from Belgium.
 

00:33:12.630 --> 00:33:15.730
What's the effect of this?
 

00:33:15.730 --> 00:33:20.200
There's this enormous crisis.
 

00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:23.470
It has to do also with this
sort of threatened virility.

00:33:23.470 --> 00:33:24.730
Why do we have fewer children?
 

00:33:24.730 --> 00:33:25.778
What's the matter with us?
 

00:33:25.778 --> 00:33:27.894
France has become too
effeminate, etc.,

00:33:27.894 --> 00:33:28.230
etc.
 

00:33:28.230 --> 00:33:30.109
You could just hear the
language of this.

00:33:30.109 --> 00:33:31.808
Women are not serving the state.
 

00:33:31.808 --> 00:33:33.599
Why are they not having babies
anymore?

00:33:33.599 --> 00:33:34.630
What's the matter?
 

00:33:34.630 --> 00:33:35.660
They want to vote.
 

00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:39.788
Is this getting in the way of
having babies that can be sent

00:33:39.788 --> 00:33:40.700
off to war?
 

00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:44.068
It causes an enormous problem.
 

00:33:44.068 --> 00:33:47.233
It's discussed all over the
place, particularly by the

00:33:47.233 --> 00:33:48.130
nationalists.
 

00:33:48.130 --> 00:33:51.598
"We don't have enough
children."

00:33:51.598 --> 00:33:56.013
Jumping ahead,
and I'll come back to this,

00:33:56.013 --> 00:33:57.630
Verdun, 1916.
 

00:33:57.630 --> 00:34:00.147
The Germans say,
"We're not going to take

00:34:00.147 --> 00:34:01.380
the forts at Verdun.
 

00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:05.493
They're impenetrable,
untakeable, cannot be taken,

00:34:05.493 --> 00:34:07.509
cannot be pris.
 

00:34:07.509 --> 00:34:11.916
But we will make them pay so
many hundreds of thousands of

00:34:11.916 --> 00:34:16.632
people, that we will bleed them
and they will be forced to sue

00:34:16.632 --> 00:34:18.179
for peace."
 

00:34:18.179 --> 00:34:20.579
Falkenhayn was the general.
 

00:34:20.579 --> 00:34:23.539
"We won't take the forts
Douaumont and Vaux,

00:34:23.539 --> 00:34:27.119
but we will kill so many
hundreds of thousands of people,

00:34:27.119 --> 00:34:30.030
and we can afford to lose
hundreds of thousands of people,

00:34:30.030 --> 00:34:31.800
because our birth rate is
higher."

00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:34.170
Nice for the people sent into
all this stuff.

00:34:34.170 --> 00:34:35.489
More about that later.
 

00:34:35.489 --> 00:34:37.639
So, this has a big effect.
 

00:34:37.639 --> 00:34:42.280
If you're going to go to war
and get Alsace-Lorraine back,

00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:45.862
and if Germany gets more and
more aggressive,

00:34:45.862 --> 00:34:49.119
irresponsible,
no question about it.

00:34:49.119 --> 00:34:53.608
In an age of aggressive
nationalism, you'd better have

00:34:53.608 --> 00:34:56.320
somebody else to help you out.
 

00:34:56.320 --> 00:35:00.382
There's a lot of them,
and they blew us away in

00:35:00.382 --> 00:35:04.889
1870-1871, and they
defeated--they didn't blow away,

00:35:04.889 --> 00:35:07.539
but they defeated Austria.
 

00:35:07.539 --> 00:35:12.594
Prussia defeated Austria in
1866, cementing its role as the

00:35:12.594 --> 00:35:15.469
most important power in Europe.
 

00:35:15.469 --> 00:35:21.059
So, that helps as well.
 

00:35:26.059 --> 00:35:29.650
The French fears and all that.
 

00:35:29.650 --> 00:35:33.949
A couple more points.
 

00:35:33.949 --> 00:35:36.277
I don't want to give you an
example from this and I mention

00:35:36.277 --> 00:35:37.000
it just briefly.
 

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.010
It's interesting about how this
works,

00:35:39.010 --> 00:35:43.797
how small incidents in a
complicated world of national

00:35:43.797 --> 00:35:48.586
rivalries and competing
identities can almost launch a

00:35:48.586 --> 00:35:49.309
war.
 

00:35:49.309 --> 00:35:50.530
Bam!
 

00:35:50.530 --> 00:35:53.824
It took the assassination of
Franz Ferdinand to start it all

00:35:53.824 --> 00:35:54.159
off.
 

00:35:54.159 --> 00:35:55.710
There would have been a war
sometime.

00:35:55.710 --> 00:36:01.675
This is the case of Zabern,
in German, Saverne in French

00:36:01.675 --> 00:36:05.039
It's a very nice little town.
 

00:36:05.039 --> 00:36:06.050
I went to Saverne.
 

00:36:06.050 --> 00:36:07.199
You've got to see all these
places.

00:36:07.199 --> 00:36:08.268
So I went to Saverne.
 

00:36:08.268 --> 00:36:09.800
There's a nice canal that runs
through it.

00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:18.030
Alsace and Strasbourg were
annexed to France in 1681 by the

00:36:18.030 --> 00:36:21.579
megalomaniac Louis XIV.
 

00:36:21.579 --> 00:36:24.500
They had been part of France a
very long time.

00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:32.849
In 1871, for reasons you know,
they become part of Germany.

00:36:32.849 --> 00:36:38.726
But this incident at Saverne,
what it does is it reinforces

00:36:38.726 --> 00:36:44.500
the stereotypes that the French
have of the Germans and that the

00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:47.250
Germans have of the French.
 

00:36:47.250 --> 00:36:50.829
It's the image of German quest
for domination,

00:36:50.829 --> 00:36:54.809
and aggressiveness and the role
of the German army,

00:36:54.809 --> 00:36:58.389
which seems to have absolutely
no limits.

00:36:58.389 --> 00:37:03.800
Someone once said about Prussia
that it was a state tacked on to

00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:04.659
an army.
 

00:37:04.659 --> 00:37:10.097
The Saverne Affair seemed to
indicate that Germany was still

00:37:10.097 --> 00:37:11.480
the same way.
 

00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:15.405
If you go up to Alsace,
you go up to the Vosges

00:37:15.405 --> 00:37:16.429
Mountains.
 

00:37:16.429 --> 00:37:19.043
There's this route called the
Route des Crêtes,

00:37:19.043 --> 00:37:20.449
or the route of the peaks.
 

00:37:20.449 --> 00:37:28.041
You can look down into the
Vosges--it still is France,

00:37:28.041 --> 00:37:33.630
but from what had been German
Alsace.

00:37:33.630 --> 00:37:37.737
You can see all of these
monuments put up by German

00:37:37.737 --> 00:37:42.911
hiking clubs to try to reaffirm
this German identity that people

00:37:42.911 --> 00:37:43.570
had.
 

00:37:43.570 --> 00:37:46.949
Identity is an extremely
complex thing.

00:37:46.949 --> 00:37:50.253
First of all,
what is clear is that the vast

00:37:50.253 --> 00:37:53.480
majority of the population spoke
German.

00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:56.608
Whether this makes them feel
German or not,

00:37:56.608 --> 00:37:57.800
it's not sure.
 

00:37:57.800 --> 00:37:59.469
Let me give you a couple
examples.

00:37:59.469 --> 00:38:01.949
I didn't send this around;
it's too much.

00:38:01.949 --> 00:38:06.150
Let's say for the total of
Alsace and Lorraine,

00:38:06.150 --> 00:38:09.860
the parts that were annexed
into the German Reich,

00:38:09.860 --> 00:38:16.780
that the number of communes in
which German dialect was the

00:38:16.780 --> 00:38:22.327
dominant language is 1,225;
in which French was the

00:38:22.327 --> 00:38:24.780
dominant language was 385.
 

00:38:24.780 --> 00:38:28.652
The percentage of the
population that spoke German is

00:38:28.652 --> 00:38:30.440
seventy-seven percent.
 

00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:33.840
The population that spoke
French as their major language

00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:35.139
was twelve percent.
 

00:38:35.139 --> 00:38:37.889
There was some bilingualism,
but not a whole lot, actually,

00:38:37.889 --> 00:38:39.789
and ten percent sort of
neither,

00:38:39.789 --> 00:38:44.722
in that they were probably more
or less perfectly bilingual

00:38:44.722 --> 00:38:47.018
because of intermarriage.
 

00:38:47.018 --> 00:38:53.601
So, when the Germans come in
after 1871, they are better than

00:38:53.601 --> 00:38:57.989
what the French did after World
War I.

00:38:57.989 --> 00:39:02.284
The French try to just rip
German out as a language of

00:39:02.284 --> 00:39:03.420
instruction.
 

00:39:03.420 --> 00:39:06.420
Get rid of all the street signs
in German.

00:39:06.420 --> 00:39:11.873
The Germans are a little more
delicate in the way that they do

00:39:11.873 --> 00:39:16.789
things, but German is the
language of administration.

00:39:16.789 --> 00:39:21.119
Another important point is that
they don't trust the Alsatians.

00:39:21.119 --> 00:39:24.780
Even though they speak German,
they don't trust them.

00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:29.340
Alsace and those parts of
Lorraine are annexed into the

00:39:29.340 --> 00:39:31.518
Reich,
but they don't have the same

00:39:31.518 --> 00:39:34.257
rights as a region that the
other parts of Germany like

00:39:34.257 --> 00:39:35.880
Wurttemberg and Bavaria have.
 

00:39:35.880 --> 00:39:39.952
German deputies from Alsace and
those parts of Lorraine don't

00:39:39.952 --> 00:39:43.483
have the right to vote on issues
of war, for example,

00:39:43.483 --> 00:39:44.909
in the Reichstag.
 

00:39:44.909 --> 00:39:50.797
They are not trusted because
they are seen as potentially

00:39:50.797 --> 00:39:53.320
disloyal to the Reich.
 

00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:58.530
The idea is that they have been
infected with Frenchness.

00:39:58.530 --> 00:40:01.820
Part of this is religious.
 

00:40:01.820 --> 00:40:03.750
It's so complex.
 

00:40:03.750 --> 00:40:05.940
Alsace is a wonderfully
interesting area.

00:40:05.940 --> 00:40:11.411
It has the largest percentage
of Protestants in France outside

00:40:11.411 --> 00:40:15.000
of Ardèche in the south
center.

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:18.005
It's also got a large
percentage of Jews,

00:40:18.005 --> 00:40:22.440
who had been victimized by
anti-Semitic riots after 1848.

00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:25.039
But the majority of the
population is Catholic.

00:40:25.039 --> 00:40:27.909
The German Empire,
going back to the Kulturkampf

00:40:27.909 --> 00:40:31.753
of Bismarck, the war against the
Catholics, still doesn't really

00:40:31.753 --> 00:40:33.219
trust the Catholics.
 

00:40:33.219 --> 00:40:37.612
You've got Catholics in
Bavaria, usually very right-wing

00:40:37.612 --> 00:40:39.449
Catholics in Bavaria.
 

00:40:39.449 --> 00:40:41.050
You've got Catholics in the
Rhineland.

00:40:41.050 --> 00:40:44.822
You've got some Catholics up in
the North in the Palatinate and

00:40:44.822 --> 00:40:47.380
you've got a lot of Catholics in
Alsace.

00:40:47.380 --> 00:40:49.929
So, they don't trust them,
basically.

00:40:49.929 --> 00:40:51.050
They don't trust them.
 

00:40:51.050 --> 00:40:55.070
Relations between the German
troops, who,

00:40:55.070 --> 00:40:57.737
as in the case of Spain,
are not coming from that

00:40:57.737 --> 00:41:00.903
region--people occupying
Catalonia come from Galicia or

00:41:00.903 --> 00:41:04.422
they come from Castile so they
won't be infected by the local

00:41:04.422 --> 00:41:06.987
population,
from the point of view of the

00:41:06.987 --> 00:41:10.588
Spanish state--so,
the troops that are in Alsace

00:41:10.588 --> 00:41:13.800
are not from Alsace,
because they don't trust them.

00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:15.889
So, tensions are very good.
 

00:41:15.889 --> 00:41:20.780
What happens in Saverne at a
place where military civil

00:41:20.780 --> 00:41:26.500
relations aren't terribly good,
in this town of 8,000 people,

00:41:26.500 --> 00:41:30.514
is that there is an incident
that gets blown out of

00:41:30.514 --> 00:41:31.559
proportion.
 

00:41:31.559 --> 00:41:35.050
There is some drilling.
 

00:41:35.050 --> 00:41:37.900
The Germans soldiers are always
drilling.

00:41:37.900 --> 00:41:42.311
And they're drilling and the
commander makes a crack about

00:41:42.311 --> 00:41:43.550
the Alsatians.
 

00:41:43.550 --> 00:41:46.784
He calls them an extremely
unfortunately scatological term

00:41:46.784 --> 00:41:49.170
that he meant to refer to all
Alsatians.

00:41:49.170 --> 00:41:51.518
He essentially says,
"Well, if you beat the

00:41:51.518 --> 00:41:54.170
hell out of those people,
you'll be doing a service to

00:41:54.170 --> 00:41:54.869
all."
 

00:41:54.869 --> 00:41:56.610
This gets around.
 

00:41:56.610 --> 00:41:59.101
One of the reasons that
relations weren't very good in

00:41:59.101 --> 00:42:02.016
this particular town was because
there was a German officer who

00:42:02.016 --> 00:42:04.980
had the bad idea of sleeping
with a fourteen-year-old girl.

00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:09.936
Some of the local guys go get
this guy in this room and just

00:42:09.936 --> 00:42:13.130
pound him into a well-deserved
pulp.

00:42:13.130 --> 00:42:15.768
So, it spins out of control.
 

00:42:15.768 --> 00:42:18.798
What happens is on both sides
in Berlin and Paris,

00:42:18.798 --> 00:42:22.324
this becomes a huge incident,
confirming the stereotype of

00:42:22.324 --> 00:42:23.190
the Other.
 

00:42:23.190 --> 00:42:27.000
There's nasty language.
 

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:30.199
Bethmann-Hollweg,
who was the chancellor then,

00:42:30.199 --> 00:42:37.510
says some over-the-top things
about the French,

00:42:37.510 --> 00:42:40.360
and the influence of France and
Alsace, etc.,

00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:41.634
etc.,
and that the French are

00:42:41.634 --> 00:42:42.159
planning a war.
 

00:42:42.159 --> 00:42:45.293
And the French government,
in a time when there is a

00:42:45.293 --> 00:42:48.849
nationalist revival,
at least among the elites in

00:42:48.849 --> 00:42:51.000
France,
they respond in kind and

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:53.900
everything gets big titles,
big titres,

00:42:53.900 --> 00:42:55.980
big headlines and stuff like
that.

00:42:55.980 --> 00:42:59.110
They don't go to war.
 

00:42:59.110 --> 00:43:03.503
But what it does is it
reaffirms these stereotypes and

00:43:03.503 --> 00:43:06.570
it makes people a little more
edgy.

00:43:06.570 --> 00:43:13.394
In 1913, but well before that,
military planners--I have three

00:43:13.394 --> 00:43:17.983
minutes and that's just what I
need--military planners are

00:43:17.983 --> 00:43:20.639
looking ahead to the next war.
 

00:43:20.639 --> 00:43:23.639
The French we've already talked
about.

00:43:23.639 --> 00:43:27.072
They have a not terribly
poetically designated plan

00:43:27.072 --> 00:43:29.407
number eighteen,
which is to invade

00:43:29.407 --> 00:43:32.429
Alsace-Lorraine with
élan.

00:43:32.429 --> 00:43:35.610
That's all you need,
they said, élan,

00:43:35.610 --> 00:43:37.199
patriotic frenzy,
fury.

00:43:37.199 --> 00:43:39.641
All you need is to be on the
offensive and that's the end of

00:43:39.641 --> 00:43:39.849
it.
 

00:43:39.849 --> 00:43:42.398
By the way, they invade wearing
red pants and they could be

00:43:42.398 --> 00:43:44.456
shot,
picked out through the fog

00:43:44.456 --> 00:43:47.275
finally in 1914,
until they put a little

00:43:47.275 --> 00:43:48.840
less-bright color on.
 

00:43:48.840 --> 00:43:53.730
How are the Germans going to
fight a war on two fronts?

00:43:53.730 --> 00:43:54.929
How are you going to do that?
 

00:43:54.929 --> 00:43:56.670
They're afraid of the Russians.
 

00:43:56.670 --> 00:43:58.610
Why?
 

00:43:58.610 --> 00:44:00.690
There are a lot of Russians and
the other peoples.

00:44:00.690 --> 00:44:03.284
They think it's going to take
about two weeks for the Russian

00:44:03.284 --> 00:44:05.690
army,
once mobilization is declared,

00:44:05.690 --> 00:44:11.885
that the big bear will roll
their forces toward the German

00:44:11.885 --> 00:44:14.929
frontier in German Poland.
 

00:44:14.929 --> 00:44:18.170
So, how are you going to win
the war in two weeks?

00:44:18.170 --> 00:44:23.072
If you invade France not
through Alsace-Lorraine,

00:44:23.072 --> 00:44:27.974
but if you invade--well,
you're going to have big

00:44:27.974 --> 00:44:29.199
trouble.
 

00:44:29.199 --> 00:44:30.710
You're going to run into
fortification.

00:44:30.710 --> 00:44:32.289
So, how are you going to invade
France?

00:44:32.289 --> 00:44:35.230
The only way you can defeat
them,

00:44:35.230 --> 00:44:37.934
and a guy called Schlieffen,
whose name I wrote in what I

00:44:37.934 --> 00:44:41.295
sent around to you,
is that you have to invade

00:44:41.295 --> 00:44:43.690
Belgium, and,
from his point of view,

00:44:43.690 --> 00:44:45.269
the Netherlands,
though Moltke,

00:44:45.269 --> 00:44:47.300
his successor,
takes the Netherlands out of

00:44:47.300 --> 00:44:47.768
the equation.
 

00:44:47.768 --> 00:44:53.429
Belgium had been declared
independent and neutral in 1831.

00:44:53.429 --> 00:44:59.369
If you go into Belgium the idea
is you invade Belgium.

00:44:59.369 --> 00:45:00.929
You get through the big fort at
Liège.

00:45:00.929 --> 00:45:03.079
You get through the kind of
rough country,

00:45:03.079 --> 00:45:04.340
which is not too much.
 

00:45:04.340 --> 00:45:08.617
Then you hit the plat
pays, the flatlands,

00:45:08.617 --> 00:45:12.360
and you roll toward the English
Channel.

00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:15.594
The last thing Schlieffen
reportedly said on his deathbed

00:45:15.594 --> 00:45:17.070
was,
"The last soldier,

00:45:17.070 --> 00:45:19.360
his right arm should touch the
English Channel."

00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:22.530
Then you turn down and you put
Paris in a headlock,

00:45:22.530 --> 00:45:26.670
and they will sue for peace and
you will beat them in two weeks

00:45:26.670 --> 00:45:30.210
before the big bear can come
moseying along slowly.

00:45:30.210 --> 00:45:35.036
That's why mobilization was
tantamount to an act of war,

00:45:35.036 --> 00:45:38.018
because it starts the
timetable.

00:45:38.018 --> 00:45:41.250
They've got to defeat them in
two weeks.

00:45:41.250 --> 00:45:43.460
What happens if you go through
Belgium?

00:45:43.460 --> 00:45:47.242
From the point of view of the
British, it's bad enough to have

00:45:47.242 --> 00:45:49.659
the sneaky French across the
Channel.

00:45:49.659 --> 00:45:53.701
But what if you've got the
Germans in Ostend eating

00:45:53.701 --> 00:45:55.559
moules frites?
 

00:45:55.559 --> 00:46:02.320
What if you have the Germans
across the Channel?

00:46:02.320 --> 00:46:08.010
Big-time enemies a very short,
choppy boat ride away.

00:46:08.010 --> 00:46:11.039
What's this going to do?
 

00:46:11.039 --> 00:46:13.760
It's going to reaffirm the
alliance.

00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:17.172
Sir Edward Grey,
the one who said most famously,

00:46:17.172 --> 00:46:20.731
and he got it right,
"Lights are going out in

00:46:20.731 --> 00:46:21.530
Europe.
 

00:46:21.530 --> 00:46:24.400
They will not be relit again in
our lifetime."

00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:29.230
At this point,
the British hesitate.

00:46:29.230 --> 00:46:31.679
The French said,
"Will the word

00:46:31.679 --> 00:46:35.880
â€˜honor' be struck from the
English dictionary?"

00:46:35.880 --> 00:46:40.547
The French ambassador is
chasing around a high official

00:46:40.547 --> 00:46:44.179
in the czarist regime in Russia
saying,

00:46:44.179 --> 00:46:46.280
"You must back us all the
way."

00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:51.893
So, the invasion guarantees
that the worst nightmare of

00:46:51.893 --> 00:46:57.404
Bismarck will come true,
that they will be à

00:46:57.404 --> 00:46:58.860
trois.
 

00:46:58.860 --> 00:47:02.699
The fact that it doesn't work
out,

00:47:02.699 --> 00:47:08.563
for a variety of reasons,
the way the German high command

00:47:08.563 --> 00:47:11.099
intended,
and the way Schlieffen

00:47:11.099 --> 00:47:13.199
intended,
and von Moltke,

00:47:13.199 --> 00:47:16.739
means that they don't,
for reasons I'll come back to,

00:47:16.739 --> 00:47:19.510
can't get Paris in that
headlock,

00:47:19.510 --> 00:47:25.371
force them to sue for peace,
and the race to the sea begins

00:47:25.371 --> 00:47:29.699
to try to outflank--as in a
football game,

00:47:29.699 --> 00:47:33.730
to make a ridiculous
analogy--the outside linebacker.

00:47:33.730 --> 00:47:35.480
They end up at the sea.
 

00:47:35.480 --> 00:47:39.333
Then shovels,
and defensive weapons like

00:47:39.333 --> 00:47:45.460
barbed wire and machine guns,
become the weapons of the war.

00:47:45.460 --> 00:47:55.141
That explains why there wasn't
and subsequently could never be

00:47:55.141 --> 00:48:02.760
a knockout punch,
and why millions of people died

00:48:02.760 --> 00:48:04.760
in and around those trenches.

00:00:02.133 --> 00:00:04.220
We've already talked about
our guest today.

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:08.260
This is David Swensen.

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.030
Remember, I said he was the
inventor of the swap, which is

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.610
a real claim to fame, because
swaps total in the hundreds of

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:18.030
billions --

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:18.480
PROFESSOR DAVID SWENSEN:
Trillions.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.802
PROFESSOR ROBERT SHILLER:
It's amazing.

00:00:19.802 --> 00:00:21.170
PROFESSOR DAVID SWENSEN: I
thought this was going to be a

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:23.530
polite introduction.

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:25.510
I used to be proud of the
swap thing, but that

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:29.535
was before the crisis.

00:00:29.535 --> 00:00:30.659
PROFESSOR ROBERT SHILLER:
Well, that's financial

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:31.340
innovation.

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.360
I think, swaps are a very
important new technology.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.260
We've been talking about that.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.450
So anyway, just to
remind you --

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.300
David Swensen came to Yale in
1985, when the portfolio was

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:45.663
worth less than $1 billion.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.375
And as of June, 2010,
it's $16.7 billion.

00:00:54.375 --> 00:00:55.320
PROFESSOR DAVID SWENSEN:
And climbing.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.170
PROFESSOR ROBERT SHILLER:
And climbing.

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.260
And this is a financial crisis,
but between 2009 and

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:07.880
2010, the portfolio went up $1.4
billion, so there's no

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.610
crisis around here.

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.182
Well, there was a little
hitch at one point.

00:01:12.182 --> 00:01:13.530
But that kind of
thing happens.

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.750
I take pride in training young
people in finance.

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.580
David Swensen has done the same
with many young people.

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.688
Notably, Andrew Golden, who
heads the Princeton portfolio,

00:01:29.688 --> 00:01:32.110
is one of your trainees.

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:37.230
And he's had an almost as
spectacular record as well.

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.230
Well, with that introduction,
I will turn it

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:40.688
over to David Swensen.

00:01:40.688 --> 00:01:41.174
PROFESSOR DAVID SWENSEN:
Thank you.

00:01:41.174 --> 00:01:50.790
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.020
PROFESSOR DAVID SWENSEN: So,
I've been at Yale for, I

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.560
guess, more than 25 years now.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.930
And for most of the 25 years,
if there was any publicity,

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.620
the publicity was pretty good.

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:06.350
For the past couple of years,
it's been a little bit mixed.

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.640
And, I liked it better, before
the publicity was mixed.

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.620
I liked it, when every article
that you would read had

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.500
something great to say about
the Yale Approach or the

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.280
Swensen Model.

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.490
But after the collapse of Lehman
Brothers and the onset

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:28.460
of the financial crisis, it
didn't take very long for the

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.702
negative headlines to appear.

00:02:30.702 --> 00:02:35.790
As a matter of fact, I carry
around this Barron's article

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:41.800
that appeared in November
2008, and the title was

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.840
''Crash Course.'' And it talked
about colleges cutting

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.300
budgets, freezing
hiring, scaling

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.690
back building projects.

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.690
And it blamed the Yale Model and
the Swensen Approach for

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.370
being too aggressive.

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.010
They said in Barron's that
university endowment should

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.510
own more stocks and bonds, less
in alternatives, because

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.440
the alternatives provided too
little diversification and too

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.590
little liquidity.

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.140
So, I thought what we could do
today as a jumping off point

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.510
is, talk about what it is that
Barron's meant when they were

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.200
talking about the Swensen
Approach or the

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.960
Yale Model and --

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.640
I think, when it was successful,
it was the Yale

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.720
Model, and when it failed, it
was the Swensen Approach,

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:29.620
which I really don't like.

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.180
There's an asymmetry there.

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.420
I keep thinking that I should
name it after one of the guys

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:35.050
in the office.

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:37.060
Maybe it should be the Takahashi
Approach instead of

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:37.850
the Swensen Approach.

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:39.670
It's time for him to have
some glory, right?

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.940
Talk about what it is that
Barron's meant by Swensen

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:50.910
Approach or the Yale Model, and
see, whether, indeed, the

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.970
criticisms that they levy,
that there's too little

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.440
diversification and two little
liquidity, whether those

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.270
criticisms are valid.

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:05.460
But to do that, let's go
back to 1985, when I

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:06.733
first arrived at Yale.

00:04:06.733 --> 00:04:12.260
It was April 1, 1985, for those
of you who care about

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:13.790
April Fools' Day.

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:20.620
I came from a six-year stint on
Wall Street, and I had no

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.440
significant portfolio management
experience.

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.520
As Bob mentioned in his
introduction, I'd been

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.940
involved with structuring the
first swap transaction in

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.560
1981, when I worked for
Salomon Brothers.

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.730
It was a swap between IBM
and the World Bank.

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:40.860
And later, Lehman Brothers hired
me to set up their swap

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.130
operations.

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:45.840
So, generally what I was doing
on Wall Street was working

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.780
with new financial technologies
and being

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:55.030
involved with the early days
of swaps transactions.

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:56.480
It was a much smaller
market then, it

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.650
wasn't hundreds of trillions.

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:02.500
And it was a much less efficient
market then, so the

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:05.550
trades were incredibly
profitable.

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:10.900
Commodity swaps today trade on
razor thin margins, and tend

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:16.240
not to be anywhere near as
profitable as they were when

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.750
the markets were much
less efficient.

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:20.650
How did I end up at Yale?

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:24.160
Well, one of my dissertation
advisors called me and said

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.940
they needed somebody to
manage the portfolio.

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:31.690
And after coming to New Haven
and talking to them about the

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:35.130
job, I realized that my heart
wasn't in Wall Street.

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:38.680
My heart was in the world of
education, and at Yale in

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:39.160
particular.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:47.370
So I came up here, amazed that
I was responsible, as Chief

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:49.750
Investment Officer, for
this portfolio.

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:52.640
It was less than $1 billion,
but close to $1 billion.

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:56.770
And the first thing I did was,
I looked around to see what

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:57.830
other people were doing.

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:01.770
That seemed like a sensible way
to approach the portfolio

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:03.130
management problem.

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:06.480
There must be some smart people
at Harvard or Princeton

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:11.630
or Stanford putting together
portfolios that make sense for

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:14.130
endowed institutions.

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:19.930
What I saw was that colleges
and universities had, on

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:26.060
average, 50% of their portfolio
in U.S. stocks, 40%

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:31.970
of their portfolio in U.S. bonds
and cash, and 10% in a

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:34.760
smattering of alternatives.

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:38.090
Even though I had no direct
portfolio management

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:41.920
experience, I had studied at
Yale and Jim Tobin and Bill

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:44.250
Brainard were my dissertation
advisors.

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:50.030
And I understood some of
the basic principles

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:52.290
of corporate finance.

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:57.330
And one of the first things that
you learn when you study

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:59.160
finance theory, is that

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:02.750
diversification is a great thing.

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:09.560
Jim Tobin won the Nobel Prize
in part for his work related

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:11.560
to the subject of
diversification.

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:15.900
In fact, when a New York Times
reporter asked Jim to explain,

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:19.400
in layman's terms, what it was
that he won the Nobel Prize

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:22.990
for, Jim said, well, I guess you
could say, don't put all

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:25.610
your eggs in one basket.

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:28.033
I didn't know you got a Nobel
Prize for that, but that's --

00:07:28.033 --> 00:07:28.150
PROFESSOR ROBERT SHILLER: We
told our students that that

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:28.215
phrase goes back to 1802.

00:07:28.215 --> 00:07:28.280
[correction: Lecture
4 mentions an

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:28.332
investment manual from 1874.

00:07:28.332 --> 00:07:28.384
According to
ngrams.googlelabs.com, the

00:07:28.384 --> 00:07:33.126
phrase can actually be
traced back to 1800.]

00:07:33.126 --> 00:07:35.140
PROFESSOR DAVID SWENSEN: OK,
so if it goes back to 1802,

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:38.720
Jim was just picking up on the
vernacular and used it as a

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:44.080
way to describe what it is
that he did his work for.

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:48.470
And Harry Markowitz, who
actually did a fair amount of

00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:53.280
his work on modern portfolio
theory at Yale's Cowles

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:55.730
Foundation, has said that

00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:58.230
diversification is a free lunch.

00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:02.020
I mean, didn't you learn in
introductory economics and

00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:03.180
intermediate [clarification:
intermediate economics]

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:05.430
that there ain't no such
thing as a free lunch?

00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:07.600
Economists are always talking
about trade-offs.

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:10.030
If you want more of this,
you have less of that.

00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:13.640
Well, with diversification,
that's not true, right?

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:16.660
If you diversify your portfolio
for a given level of

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:21.590
return, you can generate that
return at lower risk.

00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:24.860
If you diversify for a given
level of risk, you can

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:26.560
generate higher returns.

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:30.240
So, diversification is this
great thing, it's a free

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:34.580
lunch, it's something that
everybody should embrace.

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:39.659
Well, if you look at the
portfolios that I saw in the

00:08:39.659 --> 00:08:43.890
world of endowment investing in
the mid-1980s, they weren't

00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:44.840
diversified.

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:47.490
If you've got half of your
assets in a single asset

00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:51.860
class, U.S. stocks, and you
have 90% of your assets in

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:56.610
U.S. marketable securities,
you're not diversified.

00:08:56.610 --> 00:09:00.320
Half your assets in a single
asset class is way too much.

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:04.560
And the 90% that are in stocks
and bonds under many

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:10.200
circumstances will respond to
the same driver of returns,

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:13.550
interest rates, in
the same way.

00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:17.600
Lower interest rates,
mathematically, are good for

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:21.970
bonds, and lower interest rates
lower the discount rate

00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:24.440
that you use to discount future
earning streams, so

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:26.690
they're probably going to
be good for stocks too.

00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:29.410
And vice versa.

00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:32.760
And the second thing I thought
about was the notion that

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:36.980
endowments have a longer
time horizon than any

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:40.070
investor that I know.

00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:43.570
And if you've got a long time
horizon, you should be

00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:47.450
rewarded by accepting
equity risks.

00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:50.800
Because those equity risks,
even though they might not

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:54.520
reward you in the short
run, will reward

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:57.460
you in the long run.

00:09:57.460 --> 00:10:02.940
So, with a mission, as a manager
of an endowment, to

00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:05.940
preserve the purchasing power
of the portfolio in

00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:12.320
perpetuity, I expected that
other endowments would have

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:17.160
substantial equity exposures, to
take advantage of the fact

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:20.600
that, in the long run, that's
where you're going to generate

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:22.720
the greatest returns.

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:26.640
But if you think about those
endowment allocations that I

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:31.862
saw in the mid-1980s, 40% of the
assets were in bonds and

00:10:31.862 --> 00:10:36.660
cash, which are low expected
return assets.

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:43.890
So, the portfolios that I saw
when I got to Yale failed the

00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:48.380
basic common sense test of
diversification and equity

00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:56.250
orientation, and it prompted
me and my colleagues to go

00:10:56.250 --> 00:11:02.930
down a different path, to put
together a portfolio that had

00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:06.660
reasonable exposure to equities,
and put together a

00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:11.770
portfolio that was sensibly
diversified.

00:11:11.770 --> 00:11:17.020
So, I'd like to talk about how
it is that we got from where

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:21.650
we were in the mid-80s to
where we ended up in the

00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:25.790
early- to mid-90s, and where
we remain today.

00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:32.540
And to do that, I'd like to put
it in the context of the

00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:36.870
basic tools that we have
available to us as investors.

00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:40.360
And these tools are the tools
that you can employ if you're

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:45.360
managing your portfolio as an
individual, or the tools that

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:49.790
I have to employ when I'm
managing Yale's portfolio as

00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:51.450
an institutional investor.

00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:55.390
And there are basically three
things that you can do to

00:11:55.390 --> 00:11:57.070
affect your returns.

00:11:57.070 --> 00:11:59.990
First of all, you can decide
what assets you're going to

00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:03.890
have in the portfolio and in
which proportions you'll hold

00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:04.620
those assets.

00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:06.560
So, that's the asset allocation
decision.

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:09.600
How much in domestic stocks,
how much in foreign stocks,

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:11.990
how much in real estate.

00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:14.450
If you're an institutional
investor, how much in timber,

00:12:14.450 --> 00:12:16.813
how much in leveraged buyouts,
how much in venture capital.

00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:22.990
The fundamental decision of how
it is that the portfolio

00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:26.660
assets are allocated.

00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:28.480
The second thing that
you can do is make a

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:29.790
market timing decision.

00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:34.200
So, if you establish targets
for your portfolio --

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:36.980
targets with respect to how much
in domestic socks, how

00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:40.970
much in domestic bonds, how
much in foreign stocks.

00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:45.560
And then, because in the short
run, you think that --

00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:48.200
let's say domestic stocks are
expensive and foreign stocks

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:49.590
are cheap --

00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:52.690
you decide to hold more foreign
stocks and less in

00:12:52.690 --> 00:12:54.160
domestic stocks.

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:57.190
That bet, that short-term bet
against your long-term

00:12:57.190 --> 00:12:59.720
targets, is a market
timing decision.

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:03.850
And the returns that are
attributable to that deviation

00:13:03.850 --> 00:13:06.820
from your long-term targets are
the returns that would be

00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:10.620
attributable to market timing.

00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:16.250
And the third source of
returns has to do with

00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:18.560
security selection.

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:23.500
So, you've got your allocation
to domestic equities.

00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:26.230
If you buy the market -- and
the way that you buy the

00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:31.510
market is to buy an index fund
that holds all the securities

00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:34.000
in the market in the proportions
that they exist in

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.450
the market -- if you buy the
market, then your returns to

00:13:36.450 --> 00:13:41.090
security selection are zero,
because your portfolio is

00:13:41.090 --> 00:13:43.412
going to perform in line
with the market.

00:13:43.412 --> 00:13:47.820
But if you make security
selection bets, if you decide

00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:53.300
that you want to try and beat
the market, then that bet or

00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:57.180
that series of bets will
define your returns

00:13:57.180 --> 00:13:59.640
attributable to security
selection.

00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:05.350
So, if you decide that you think
the prospects of Ford

00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:08.750
are superior to the prospects
of GM, well, you want to

00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:12.620
overweight Ford and
underweight GM.

00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:17.340
And if that turns out to be a
good bet and you're rewarded,

00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:20.300
because Ford outperforms and
GM underperforms, then you

00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:22.450
have a positive return to
security selection.

00:14:22.450 --> 00:14:25.380
If the converse is true, then
you have a negative return to

00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:27.280
security selection.

00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:30.130
But one of the really important
facts about security

00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:33.980
selection is that, if
you play for free,

00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:35.970
it's a zero sum game.

00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:39.450
Because if you've overweighted
Ford and underweighted GM,

00:14:39.450 --> 00:14:44.490
there has to be some other
investor or group of investors

00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:47.820
that are underweight Ford and
overweight GM, because this is

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:50.060
all relative to the market.

00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:54.460
And so, if you're overweight
Ford and underweight GM and

00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:58.190
somebody else is underweight
Ford and overweight GM, well,

00:14:58.190 --> 00:15:00.740
at the end of the day, the
amount by which the winner

00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:03.910
wins equals the amount by
which the loser loses.

00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:06.130
And so, it's a zero-sum game.

00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:09.110
Of course, if you take into
account the fact that it costs

00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:11.360
money to play the game,
it turns into a

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:12.710
negative-sum game.

00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:15.880
And the negative-sum is the
amount that's siphoned off by

00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:17.500
Wall Street.

00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:21.700
And Wall Street takes its pound
of flesh in the form of

00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:25.720
market impact, in the form of
commissions, in the form of

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:32.410
fees that are charged to manage
the portfolio actively,

00:15:32.410 --> 00:15:34.500
and then sometimes there are
even fees to consultants to

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:35.460
choose the manager.

00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:39.310
So, there's an enormous drain
from the system that causes

00:15:39.310 --> 00:15:46.900
the active investment activity
to be a negative-sum game for

00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:50.442
those investors that
decide to play.

00:15:50.442 --> 00:15:54.860
So, let's take these in turn
and start out with asset

00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:57.700
allocation.

00:15:57.700 --> 00:16:03.710
Asset allocation is far and away
the most important tool

00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:07.970
that we have available
to us as investors.

00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:13.930
When I first started thinking
about this 25 years ago, I

00:16:13.930 --> 00:16:17.000
thought, well, maybe there's
some financial law that says

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.100
that asset allocation is the
most important tool, because

00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:22.860
it seems pretty obvious that
that was going to be the most

00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:25.530
powerful determinant
of returns.

00:16:25.530 --> 00:16:29.800
But it turns out, that it's not
really a law of finance

00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:33.370
that asset allocation dominates
returns, it's a

00:16:33.370 --> 00:16:38.160
behavioral result of how it
is that we as individual

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:41.770
investors, or we as
institutional investors,

00:16:41.770 --> 00:16:45.110
manage our portfolios.

00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:50.540
If I make it back to my office,
traversing these icy

00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:59.020
sidewalks, I could take Yale's
$17 or $18 billion dollars and

00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:00.270
put it all in Google stock.

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:06.819
If I did that, I am not sure
how long I'd keep my job.

00:17:06.819 --> 00:17:11.410
It might be fun for a while,
but that would probably be

00:17:11.410 --> 00:17:13.240
damaging to my employment
prospects.

00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:17.280
But if I did that, asset
allocation would have almost

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:19.910
nothing to say about
Yale's returns.

00:17:19.910 --> 00:17:25.010
It would be the idiosyncratic
return associated with Google

00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:28.990
that would determine whether the
endowment went up or down

00:17:28.990 --> 00:17:31.480
or stayed flat.

00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:36.710
And so, security selection
would be the overwhelming

00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:42.140
important determinant of returns
for Yale's endowment.

00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:45.580
And if it wasn't exciting enough
to sell everything and

00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:49.550
put it on Google stock, maybe
I could go back to my office

00:17:49.550 --> 00:17:55.260
and start day trading
bond futures.

00:17:55.260 --> 00:18:00.040
Well, if I took Yale's entire
$17 or $18 billion dollars and

00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:03.930
started trading bond futures
with it, asset allocation

00:18:03.930 --> 00:18:07.690
would have very little to
say about Yale's return.

00:18:07.690 --> 00:18:10.180
Security selection would
probably have very little to

00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:13.020
say about Yale's return, so it
would all be about market

00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:14.660
timing ability.

00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:20.120
And if I'm great at following
the trend -- the trend is your

00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:23.130
friend -- of course, that's
true until it's not.

00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:28.620
Or if I've got some sort of
marvelous scheme to outsmart

00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:31.440
all the other smart people, who
are trading in the bond

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:34.550
market, I could generate
some nice returns.

00:18:34.550 --> 00:18:39.710
But those returns would have
nothing to do with asset

00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:42.930
allocation, nothing to do with
security selection, and

00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:46.340
everything to do with
market timing.

00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:49.900
Of course, these sound like
ridiculous things, right?

00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:53.320
I mean, everybody in this room
knows, that I'm not going to

00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:59.045
go back and put Yale's entire
endowment in one stock.

00:18:59.045 --> 00:19:03.140
And we also know, that I'm not
going to go back and day trade

00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:06.670
futures with the endowment.

00:19:06.670 --> 00:19:09.090
I'm going to go back, and the
portfolio is going to look a

00:19:09.090 --> 00:19:12.170
lot like it looked yesterday,
and the day before, and the

00:19:12.170 --> 00:19:17.860
month before that, and the year
before that, because as

00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:21.700
investors, whether we're
individual investors are

00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:25.970
institutional investors, we
tend to have a sensible,

00:19:25.970 --> 00:19:30.550
stable approach to
asset allocation.

00:19:30.550 --> 00:19:34.590
And within the asset allocation
framework that we

00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:40.030
employ, we tend to hold
well-diversified portfolios of

00:19:40.030 --> 00:19:44.450
securities within each
of the asset classes.

00:19:44.450 --> 00:19:49.600
So, that means that asset
allocation is going to be the

00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:52.720
predominant determinant
of returns.

00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:58.252
Bob Shiller and I have a
colleague at the School of

00:19:58.252 --> 00:20:01.140
Management, Roger Ibbotson,
who's done a fair amount of

00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:03.440
work looking at the
various sources

00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:05.800
of returns for investors.

00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:08.990
And a number of years ago, he
came out with a finding that

00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:11.940
more than 90% of the variability
of returns in

00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:14.600
institutional portfolios had
to do with the asset

00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:16.695
allocation decision.

00:20:16.695 --> 00:20:25.250
And that was a very widely
read, and widely accepted

00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:27.070
conclusion.

00:20:27.070 --> 00:20:30.280
In that same study, I thought
that there was a more

00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:33.110
interesting conclusion, and that
was that asset allocation

00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:39.460
actually determined more than
100% of investor returns.

00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:42.760
How could that be, how could
asset allocation determine

00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:44.340
more than 100% of returns?

00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:47.890
Well, it goes back to the
discussion that we had about

00:20:47.890 --> 00:20:50.350
security selection and the fact
that it's not free to

00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:52.600
play the game, and the
same thing's true

00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:54.640
about market timing.

00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:59.700
If somebody is overweighting
a particular asset class

00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:04.280
relative to the long-term
targets that they've got,

00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:05.160
well, there's got to
be an offsetting

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:06.470
position in the markets.

00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:09.100
Market timing is expensive in
the same way that security

00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:11.020
selection is expensive.

00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:17.990
And so, it, too, is a zero-sum
game, even though the analysis

00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:20.190
that you'd apply to market
timing isn't quite as clear

00:21:20.190 --> 00:21:24.300
and crisp as in the closed
system that you've got with

00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:27.350
any individual securities
market.

00:21:27.350 --> 00:21:33.040
So, if security selection
and market timing were

00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:39.510
negative-sum games, then asset
allocation would explain more

00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:42.010
than 100% of the returns.

00:21:42.010 --> 00:21:47.690
And, on average, for the
community as a whole --

00:21:47.690 --> 00:21:50.860
because investors do engage in
market timing, investors do

00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:53.650
engage in security
selections --

00:21:53.650 --> 00:21:56.050
those are going to be
negative-sum games, and you

00:21:56.050 --> 00:22:00.060
have to subtract the leakages
occurring because of security

00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:03.580
selection and market timing,
in order to get down to the

00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:08.820
returns that you would get if
you just took your asset

00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:12.280
allocation targets and
implemented them passively.

00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:22.360
So, it turns out that asset
allocation is the most

00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:32.410
important way that we express
our basic tenets of investment

00:22:32.410 --> 00:22:33.950
philosophy.

00:22:33.950 --> 00:22:39.470
I talked about the importance
of having an equity bias.

00:22:39.470 --> 00:22:44.920
Well, these are some
of Ibbotson's data.

00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:48.530
He's got this publication called
Stocks, Bonds, Bills,

00:22:48.530 --> 00:22:51.620
and Inflation, although he
might have sold it to

00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:55.180
Morningstar, so maybe it's
Morningstar's publication now.

00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:58.740
And it actually is an outgrowth
of some academic

00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:02.220
research that he did
decades ago.

00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:11.060
And the basic drill was,
starting in 1925, looking at a

00:23:11.060 --> 00:23:12.900
number of asset classes --

00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:15.720
the ones that I've got here are
Treasury bills, Treasury

00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:20.650
bonds, large stocks, small
stocks, and then, as a

00:23:20.650 --> 00:23:23.520
benchmark, inflation --

00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:26.740
starting the investment at the
end of 1925, taking whatever

00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:30.290
income was generated from that
investment, reinvesting it and

00:23:30.290 --> 00:23:33.255
seeing where you end up at
the end of the period.

00:23:33.255 --> 00:23:39.310
I've got here the numbers
from 1925 to 2009.

00:23:39.310 --> 00:23:41.770
And if you did that with
Treasury bills, which are

00:23:41.770 --> 00:23:44.970
short-term loans to the U.S.
government, one of the least

00:23:44.970 --> 00:23:49.390
risky assets imaginable, you
would have ended up with 21

00:23:49.390 --> 00:23:50.610
times your money over
the period.

00:23:50.610 --> 00:23:52.680
If you think about that, 21
times your money, that's

00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:54.410
pretty good.

00:23:54.410 --> 00:23:58.440
But if you think about the fact
that inflation consumed a

00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:01.790
multiple of 12, well,
you didn't end up

00:24:01.790 --> 00:24:03.770
with a lot after inflation.

00:24:03.770 --> 00:24:07.220
And if you're an institution
like Yale and you only want to

00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:09.720
consume after-inflation returns,
so you can maintain

00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:14.890
the purchasing power the
portfolio, well, 21 times, but

00:24:14.890 --> 00:24:19.570
taking off 12 times for
inflation, not so good.

00:24:19.570 --> 00:24:22.600
One of the interesting things
about the Stocks, Bonds,

00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:26.040
Bills, and Inflation numbers
over long periods is that they

00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:30.220
correspond to our sense of the
relationship between the

00:24:30.220 --> 00:24:35.360
riskiness of the asset, and the
notion that, if you except

00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:38.120
more risk, you should
get higher returns.

00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:41.530
And so, if you move up the risk
spectrum and, instead of

00:24:41.530 --> 00:24:44.890
looking at Treasury bills, you
look at Treasury bonds, you

00:24:44.890 --> 00:24:47.980
end up with a multiple
of 86 times.

00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:49.550
That's pretty good, 86 times.

00:24:49.550 --> 00:24:54.620
I mean, it's a lot better
than 21 times for bills.

00:24:54.620 --> 00:24:58.570
It's still not a huge
return for decades

00:24:58.570 --> 00:25:02.500
and decades of investing.

00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:06.800
So, what happens if you move
away from lending money, in

00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:07.890
this case lending money to the

00:25:07.890 --> 00:25:11.940
government, to owning equities?

00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:16.025
The multiple over this period --
and this includes the crash

00:25:16.025 --> 00:25:23.830
in 1929, the market collapse in
1987, and the most recent

00:25:23.830 --> 00:25:25.950
financial crisis.

00:25:25.950 --> 00:25:30.960
In spite of those blips, you
would've ended up with 2,592

00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:33.370
times your money.

00:25:33.370 --> 00:25:37.950
That's stunning, that's way
more than 86 times and way

00:25:37.950 --> 00:25:39.170
more than 21 times.

00:25:39.170 --> 00:25:43.090
So, over long periods of time,
you do end up being rewarded

00:25:43.090 --> 00:25:44.700
for accepting equity risk.

00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:46.400
And what would've happened if
you would have put the money

00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:49.060
in small stocks and
let her run?

00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:53.350
12,226 times your money.

00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:56.730
So, the conclusion is
pretty obvious.

00:25:56.730 --> 00:26:00.640
This notion that, if you've got
a long time horizon, you

00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:04.010
want to expose your portfolio
to equities, it makes an

00:26:04.010 --> 00:26:05.936
enormous amount of sense.

00:26:05.936 --> 00:26:09.430
As a matter of fact, the first
time I took a look at these

00:26:09.430 --> 00:26:16.100
numbers was back in 1986,
when I was teaching --

00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:18.210
probably a predecessor to the
class that Bob Shiller's

00:26:18.210 --> 00:26:24.280
teaching, it was a lecture
class in finance --

00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:32.100
and I was preparing the lecture
that had to do with

00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:36.920
long-term investment
philosophy.

00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:39.590
And that's when I first saw
these numbers, and I was

00:26:39.590 --> 00:26:42.720
little bit disconcerted when
I put them together.

00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:48.920
Because I thought, gee, 21 times
for bills, 86 times for

00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:53.000
bonds, 12,226 times
for small stocks.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.050
Maybe the right thing to do
is to just put the whole

00:26:55.050 --> 00:27:00.000
portfolio into small stocks
and forget about it.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.900
And my first problem was that,
if that were true, what was I

00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:07.790
going to say for the next
ten weeks of lectures?

00:27:07.790 --> 00:27:10.300
My longer-term problem was,
that, if the investment

00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:12.410
committee figured out, that all
we needed to do is put the

00:27:12.410 --> 00:27:14.550
whole portfolio in small stocks,
and that that was the

00:27:14.550 --> 00:27:17.630
way to investment success,
I wouldn't have a job.

00:27:17.630 --> 00:27:19.280
They wouldn't need
me to do that.

00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:21.500
And I had a wife and young
children, and I like getting a

00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:23.675
paycheck and being able to
feed and house them.

00:27:23.675 --> 00:27:30.850
So, I took a look at the data
more carefully, and there are

00:27:30.850 --> 00:27:36.840
a number of examples of
what it is that I'm

00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:37.860
going to talk about.

00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:41.260
But the most profound example
remains around the

00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:44.620
great crash in 1929.

00:27:44.620 --> 00:27:47.640
And if you had your whole
portfolio in small stocks at

00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:52.820
the peak, by the end of 1929,
you would have lost 54% of

00:27:52.820 --> 00:27:54.620
your money.

00:27:54.620 --> 00:27:57.520
By the end of 1930, you would
have lost another 38% of your

00:27:57.520 --> 00:28:02.160
money, by the end of 1931,
you would have

00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:05.110
lost another 50% percent.

00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:08.140
And by June of 1932, for good
measure, you would've lost

00:28:08.140 --> 00:28:11.330
another 32%.

00:28:11.330 --> 00:28:15.540
So, for every dollar that you
had at the peak, at the trough

00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:17.850
you would have had $0.10 left.

00:28:17.850 --> 00:28:22.510
And it doesn't matter, whether
you're an investor with the

00:28:22.510 --> 00:28:26.340
strongest stomach known to
mankind, or you're an

00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:31.230
institutional investor with the
longest investment horizon

00:28:31.230 --> 00:28:34.880
imaginable, at some point, when
the dollars are turning

00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:39.630
into dimes, you're going to
say, this is a completely

00:28:39.630 --> 00:28:42.020
ridiculous thing to accept this

00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:44.860
much risk in the portfolio.

00:28:44.860 --> 00:28:46.310
I can't stand it.

00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:51.900
I'm selling all my small stocks
and I'm going to buy

00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:53.480
Treasury bonds or
Treasury bills.

00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:56.780
And that's exactly
what people did.

00:28:56.780 --> 00:29:04.180
And there was this sense in the
1930s, 1940s, even into

00:29:04.180 --> 00:29:09.530
the '50s and '60s, that heavy
equity exposures weren't a

00:29:09.530 --> 00:29:12.880
responsible thing
for a fiduciary.

00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:17.910
When I was writing my book, I
was fooling around looking at

00:29:17.910 --> 00:29:20.730
articles from the Saturday
Evening Post -- and I know

00:29:20.730 --> 00:29:24.120
everybody here is too young to
have seen the Saturday Evening

00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:30.230
Post when it was still
publishing, but you've all

00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:31.900
seen Norman Rockwell
prints, right?

00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:35.640
Well, he was famous for doing
covers for the Saturday

00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:39.160
Evening Post. And there was this
article in the 1930s --

00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:43.070
that's actually before my time,
so I was looking at

00:29:43.070 --> 00:29:45.620
things in the library, not
things that actually had been

00:29:45.620 --> 00:29:47.640
delivered to my doorstep --

00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:54.180
and the commentator said that it
was ridiculous that stocks

00:29:54.180 --> 00:29:56.820
were called securities.

00:29:56.820 --> 00:29:59.480
That they were so risky that
we should call stocks

00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:01.490
insecurities.

00:30:01.490 --> 00:30:06.960
There was just this visceral
dislike for the risks that

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:10.180
were associated with the stock
market, because it had caused

00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:13.540
so many investors
so much pain.

00:30:13.540 --> 00:30:19.630
So yes, stocks are a great thing
for investors with long

00:30:19.630 --> 00:30:23.400
time horizons, but you need to
diversify, because you've got

00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:29.410
to be able to live through
those inevitable periods,

00:30:29.410 --> 00:30:35.920
where risky assets produce
results that are sometimes so

00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:40.020
bad as to be frightening.

00:30:40.020 --> 00:30:43.770
Second source of return,
market timing.

00:30:43.770 --> 00:30:50.960
A few years ago, a group of
former colleagues of mine gave

00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:55.530
me a party at the Yale Club, and
they presented me with a

00:30:55.530 --> 00:30:59.590
copy of Keynes's General
Theory --

00:30:59.590 --> 00:31:03.230
because back, when I used to
teach a big finance class like

00:31:03.230 --> 00:31:08.500
this, the last class always
involved reading from Keynes.

00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:12.660
And I think Keynes is one of
the best authors about

00:31:12.660 --> 00:31:18.460
investing and financial
markets, bar none.

00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:21.100
I remember one of my students
telling me afterwards, that I

00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:24.020
was reading from Keynes as if I
were reading from the Bible.

00:31:24.020 --> 00:31:28.490
And I had this paperback copy
that was falling apart, and my

00:31:28.490 --> 00:31:32.830
former students remembered this
and they gave me this

00:31:32.830 --> 00:31:34.360
beautiful first edition
of Keynes.

00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:37.240
And I was on the train back from
New York, where the party

00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:44.560
had occurred, to New Haven
and I found this quote.

00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:47.250
"The idea of wholesale shifts
is, for various reasons,

00:31:47.250 --> 00:31:50.180
impracticable and indeed
undesirable.

00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:53.880
Most of those who attempt to,
sell too late and buy too late

00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:57.020
and do both too often, incurring
heavy expenses" --

00:31:57.020 --> 00:31:59.740
there's that negative-sum game
thing -- "and developing too

00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:04.140
unsettled and speculative a
state of mind." And as, in

00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:09.380
most things, the data support
Keynes's conclusions.

00:32:09.380 --> 00:32:14.990
Morningstar did a study of all
of the mutual funds in the

00:32:14.990 --> 00:32:18.400
U.S. domestic equity market,
and there were 17

00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:20.410
categories of funds.

00:32:20.410 --> 00:32:22.630
And what they did with this
study is, they looked at 10

00:32:22.630 --> 00:32:26.230
years of returns and compared
dollar-weighted returns to

00:32:26.230 --> 00:32:27.810
time-weighted returns.

00:32:27.810 --> 00:32:30.500
The time-weighted returns are
simply the returns that are

00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:32.060
generated year in
and year out.

00:32:32.060 --> 00:32:34.780
If you get an offering
memorandum or a prospectus,

00:32:34.780 --> 00:32:37.220
they'll show you the
time-weighted return.

00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:40.910
If you look at the
advertisements, where Fidelity

00:32:40.910 --> 00:32:47.070
is touting its latest, greatest
funds, the returns

00:32:47.070 --> 00:32:49.260
that you see are time-weighted
returns.

00:32:49.260 --> 00:32:52.990
Dollar-weighted returns take
into account cash flow.

00:32:52.990 --> 00:32:55.970
So, in a dollar-weighted return,
if investors put more

00:32:55.970 --> 00:32:59.810
money into the fund in a
particular year, that year's

00:32:59.810 --> 00:33:03.710
return will have a greater
weight in the calculation.

00:33:03.710 --> 00:33:06.090
So, here we have all the mutual
funds in the U.S., 17

00:33:06.090 --> 00:33:09.310
categories, time-weighted
versus dollar-weighted.

00:33:09.310 --> 00:33:12.840
In every one of those
categories, the

00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:15.160
dollar-weighted returns
were less than the

00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:16.900
time-weighted returns.

00:33:16.900 --> 00:33:17.940
What does that mean?

00:33:17.940 --> 00:33:22.630
That means, that investors
systematically made perverse

00:33:22.630 --> 00:33:28.140
decisions, as to when to invest
and when to disinvest

00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:29.350
from mutual funds.

00:33:29.350 --> 00:33:37.100
What investors were doing, they
were buying in after a

00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:41.340
fund had showed strong relative
performance and

00:33:41.340 --> 00:33:47.160
selling after a fund had shown
poor relative performance.

00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:49.670
So, they were systematically
buying high and selling low,

00:33:49.670 --> 00:33:53.340
and it doesn't matter whether
you do that with great

00:33:53.340 --> 00:33:56.310
enthusiasm and in great volume,
it's a really, really

00:33:56.310 --> 00:33:57.680
bad way to make money.

00:33:57.680 --> 00:33:59.210
Very difficult.

00:33:59.210 --> 00:34:07.815
So, the conclusion for these
individuals that operate in

00:34:07.815 --> 00:34:12.760
the mutual fund market is that
their market timing decisions

00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:15.275
were systematically perverse.

00:34:15.275 --> 00:34:21.320
I also took a look at the top
10 internet funds during the

00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:24.510
tech bubble, something I
published in my book for

00:34:24.510 --> 00:34:27.070
individual investors.

00:34:27.070 --> 00:34:30.850
And if you looked at the top 10
internet funds three years

00:34:30.850 --> 00:34:33.440
before and three years after the
bubble, the time weighted

00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:36.786
return was 1.5% per year.

00:34:36.786 --> 00:34:39.590
You look at that and you say,
1.5% per year, well, the

00:34:39.590 --> 00:34:42.780
market went way up and way
down, but 1.5% per year,

00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:43.760
that's not so bad.

00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:46.420
No harm, no foul.

00:34:46.420 --> 00:34:53.600
Investors invested $13.7 billion
and lost $9.9 billion,

00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:56.870
so they lost 72% of what
they invested.

00:34:56.870 --> 00:34:59.430
How could it be that they lost
72% of the money that they

00:34:59.430 --> 00:35:03.150
invested, when the time-weighted
return was 1.5%

00:35:03.150 --> 00:35:04.250
per year for six years?

00:35:04.250 --> 00:35:08.160
Well, they weren't invested in
the internet funds in '97, and

00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:11.000
they weren't invested in
'98, and they weren't

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:12.640
invested in early '99.

00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:16.370
It was in late '99 and early
2000, that all the money piled

00:35:16.370 --> 00:35:19.460
in at the very top.

00:35:19.460 --> 00:35:23.050
And then, in 2001 and
2002, bitterly

00:35:23.050 --> 00:35:25.430
disappointed, they sold.

00:35:25.430 --> 00:35:29.150
So, they lost 72% of what they
put in, even though the

00:35:29.150 --> 00:35:34.640
time-weighted returns were
1.5% per year positive.

00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:41.710
So, institutions don't get
a free pass either.

00:35:41.710 --> 00:35:47.200
If you look at the crash in
October, 1987, which was an

00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:50.310
extraordinary event --

00:35:50.310 --> 00:35:54.170
I think, the calculation I did
put it at a 25 standard

00:35:54.170 --> 00:35:59.400
deviation, which is essentially
an impossibility.

00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:03.490
But however you measure it, it
was an extraordinary event.

00:36:03.490 --> 00:36:05.740
And what happened on
October 19, 1987?

00:36:05.740 --> 00:36:08.520
Well, stock markets the
world around went down

00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:10.690
by more than 20%.

00:36:10.690 --> 00:36:14.590
What people forget is, along
with the stock markets going

00:36:14.590 --> 00:36:16.260
down, there was a huge
rally in government

00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:18.680
bonds, flight to safety.

00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:22.360
So, stocks were cheaper, bonds
were more expensive.

00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:25.000
What did institutional
investors do?

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:26.440
Well, they got scared,
and they sold

00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:29.310
stocks and bought bonds.

00:36:29.310 --> 00:36:32.260
Same thing, buying high
and selling low.

00:36:32.260 --> 00:36:38.610
As a matter of fact, endowments
took six years to

00:36:38.610 --> 00:36:44.830
get their post-crash equity
allocations back up to where

00:36:44.830 --> 00:36:48.700
they were before the crash,
arguably underweighted in

00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:52.150
equities in the heart of one of
the greatest bull markets

00:36:52.150 --> 00:36:54.610
of all time.

00:36:54.610 --> 00:36:58.650
So, the teams of investors,
whether they're individual or

00:36:58.650 --> 00:37:05.650
institutional, have this
perverse predilection to

00:37:05.650 --> 00:37:06.530
chasing performance.

00:37:06.530 --> 00:37:10.430
Buying something after it's
gone up, selling something

00:37:10.430 --> 00:37:14.370
after it's gone down, and using
market timing to damage

00:37:14.370 --> 00:37:17.490
portfolio returns.

00:37:17.490 --> 00:37:20.750
The final tool that we have
available to us as investors

00:37:20.750 --> 00:37:23.150
is security selection.

00:37:23.150 --> 00:37:28.890
I cite a study in my book,
''Unconventional Success,''

00:37:28.890 --> 00:37:32.060
conducted by Rob Arnott, that
does a very good job of

00:37:32.060 --> 00:37:36.170
looking at 20 years worth
of mutual fund returns.

00:37:36.170 --> 00:37:41.690
And he says that there's about
a 14% chance that -- or

00:37:41.690 --> 00:37:44.270
historically there was a 14%
chance -- of beating the

00:37:44.270 --> 00:37:50.460
market after adjusting
for fees and taxes.

00:37:50.460 --> 00:37:55.060
So, you think a zero-sum game
would be a coin flip, 50-50.

00:37:55.060 --> 00:37:57.950
But because of the leakages from
the system, and because

00:37:57.950 --> 00:38:02.610
of taxes, the probability of
winning goes down to 14%.

00:38:02.610 --> 00:38:08.280
But oh by the way, that
14% ignores two

00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:09.350
very important things.

00:38:09.350 --> 00:38:12.980
One is that a huge percentage
of mutual funds

00:38:12.980 --> 00:38:14.600
have front-end loads.

00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:19.360
If you call your friendly broker
to buy a mutual fund,

00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:24.120
they'll extract a payment of
2% or 3% or 4% or 5% or 6%.

00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:27.010
Those numbers aren't included,
so, if you included the loads,

00:38:27.010 --> 00:38:29.200
that would make the likelihood
of winning

00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:30.880
substantially less than 14%.

00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:35.490
But even more important is the
concept of survivorship bias.

00:38:35.490 --> 00:38:38.830
If you look at 20 years worth
of returns, the only returns

00:38:38.830 --> 00:38:41.070
you can look at are the returns
of the funds that

00:38:41.070 --> 00:38:43.040
survived for 20 years.

00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:46.140
Well, which funds
didn't survive?

00:38:46.140 --> 00:38:48.480
Almost always, the
funds that don't

00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:50.540
survive are the failures.

00:38:50.540 --> 00:38:52.300
So, you're only looking
at the winners.

00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:57.810
If you look at the winners and
you only have a 14% chance, if

00:38:57.810 --> 00:39:02.390
you take into account the
losers, that 14% chance has to

00:39:02.390 --> 00:39:04.740
go to, essentially, zero.

00:39:04.740 --> 00:39:09.200
And is survivorship bias an
important phenomenon?

00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:09.820
It is.

00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:15.140
The Center for Research in
Securities Prices has a

00:39:15.140 --> 00:39:19.770
survivorship bias-free U.S.
mutual fund database, meaning

00:39:19.770 --> 00:39:24.510
that it tracks the
funds that fail.

00:39:24.510 --> 00:39:29.010
There were 30,361 funds
in the database.

00:39:29.010 --> 00:39:32.840
19,129 were living.

00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:36.900
11,232 were dead.

00:39:36.900 --> 00:39:44.970
So, more than a third of the
funds in this survivorship

00:39:44.970 --> 00:39:48.040
bias-free database were
ones that had died.

00:39:48.040 --> 00:39:52.980
And they died mostly,
because they failed.

00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:54.860
And that's kind of an honorable
way to die.

00:39:54.860 --> 00:39:56.710
There are other ways to die.

00:39:56.710 --> 00:39:59.870
If you're a big mutual fund
complex like Fidelity and

00:39:59.870 --> 00:40:04.620
you've got an underperforming
fund, what you tend to do is

00:40:04.620 --> 00:40:07.260
something like, oh, let's merge
that into this fund that

00:40:07.260 --> 00:40:08.780
has good performance.

00:40:08.780 --> 00:40:09.660
And guess what happens?

00:40:09.660 --> 00:40:13.180
Fidelity loses a fund that has
bad performance, and one that

00:40:13.180 --> 00:40:17.390
has good performance has more
assets, because they merge the

00:40:17.390 --> 00:40:19.350
underperforming fund into it,
and makes them look like

00:40:19.350 --> 00:40:23.820
they're a more successful
fund management firm.

00:40:23.820 --> 00:40:28.280
There's one other aspect of
security selection that's

00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:34.670
important, an aspect other
than the fact that it's a

00:40:34.670 --> 00:40:39.120
negative-sum game that's
very tough for

00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:43.290
practitioners to win.

00:40:43.290 --> 00:40:46.070
And that has to do with the
degree of opportunity that

00:40:46.070 --> 00:40:48.770
you've got in various
asset classes.

00:40:48.770 --> 00:40:53.680
A number of years ago, I wanted
to come up with a way

00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:59.220
of identifying, in an analytical
manner, where it is

00:40:59.220 --> 00:41:01.140
that we could find the most
attractive investment

00:41:01.140 --> 00:41:02.310
opportunities.

00:41:02.310 --> 00:41:05.500
And, as far as I know, financial
economists haven't

00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:13.160
determined a way to directly
measure, how efficient

00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:15.950
individual markets are.

00:41:15.950 --> 00:41:20.360
So, I took a look at
distributions of returns for

00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:22.190
various asset classes.

00:41:22.190 --> 00:41:26.370
And I had this notion that,
if a market priced assets

00:41:26.370 --> 00:41:32.470
efficiently, the distribution
of returns around the market

00:41:32.470 --> 00:41:34.790
return would be very tight.

00:41:34.790 --> 00:41:35.910
Why would that be?

00:41:35.910 --> 00:41:40.930
Well, if somebody makes a big
bet in an efficient market, by

00:41:40.930 --> 00:41:46.290
definition, whether that
succeeds or fails has to do

00:41:46.290 --> 00:41:50.400
with more luck than sense.

00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:53.350
Because the premise is, that
these assets are efficiently

00:41:53.350 --> 00:41:56.530
priced, and you don't make a big
win on a big bet, unless

00:41:56.530 --> 00:41:59.150
there's an inefficiency that
you're exploiting.

00:41:59.150 --> 00:42:02.680
So, if you're making big bets
in an efficiently priced

00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:05.810
market, you might win one year
and gather more assets, and

00:42:05.810 --> 00:42:07.950
you might win another year and
gather more assets, but,

00:42:07.950 --> 00:42:09.990
ultimately, your luck is
going to run out and

00:42:09.990 --> 00:42:11.210
you're going to fail.

00:42:11.210 --> 00:42:13.250
And then, people will fire
you, and you'll lose your

00:42:13.250 --> 00:42:16.800
assets, and lose your
income stream.

00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:21.280
So, the right thing to do in an
efficiently priced market

00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:23.700
is to hug the benchmark.

00:42:23.700 --> 00:42:25.380
People call it Closet
Indexing, look

00:42:25.380 --> 00:42:27.960
like everybody else.

00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:32.720
And we're human beings, we don't
like firing people and

00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:35.250
we don't like admitting
we're wrong.

00:42:35.250 --> 00:42:39.760
And so, if somebody has
market-like performance, and

00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:42.780
maybe it's not all that
outstanding, say, OK fine,

00:42:42.780 --> 00:42:47.870
we'll just continue with this
particular investment

00:42:47.870 --> 00:42:52.120
strategy, even though it's not
doing great things, at least

00:42:52.120 --> 00:42:54.040
it's not doing terrible
things.

00:42:54.040 --> 00:42:57.290
On the other end of the
spectrum, maybe there's not

00:42:57.290 --> 00:43:01.500
even a market that you
can match with

00:43:01.500 --> 00:43:04.250
your investment strategy.

00:43:04.250 --> 00:43:07.200
I mean, think about
venture capital.

00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:10.010
I mean, how is it that you could
index venture capital?

00:43:10.010 --> 00:43:12.950
You can't, that's a bunch of
private partnerships and a

00:43:12.950 --> 00:43:16.240
bunch of idiosyncratic
enterprises.

00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:20.240
And even if you wanted to, you
couldn't match the market.

00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:27.210
So, you're forced to go out and
forge your own path, and

00:43:27.210 --> 00:43:30.770
live and die by the decisions
that you make.

00:43:30.770 --> 00:43:33.690
So, how does this thought piece

00:43:33.690 --> 00:43:37.170
translate into real numbers?

00:43:37.170 --> 00:43:39.690
So again, we're looking at 10
years worth of returns for

00:43:39.690 --> 00:43:41.000
various asset classes.

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.500
I look at the difference between
the top quartile

00:43:43.500 --> 00:43:45.610
manager and the bottom
quartile --

00:43:45.610 --> 00:43:46.890
the difference between first and
third [correction: fourth]

00:43:46.890 --> 00:43:48.310
quartile, you can use
any measure of

00:43:48.310 --> 00:43:49.880
distribution that you want.

00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:53.290
And in the bond market, which
is probably the most

00:43:53.290 --> 00:43:55.350
efficiently priced of all
markets -- and the reason it's

00:43:55.350 --> 00:43:57.760
most efficiently priced
is, because bonds

00:43:57.760 --> 00:43:59.430
are just math, right?

00:43:59.430 --> 00:44:03.610
You've got coupons, you've
got principal, you've got

00:44:03.610 --> 00:44:08.140
probabilities of default, it's
the most easily analyzed of

00:44:08.140 --> 00:44:10.060
all the assets in
which we invest.

00:44:10.060 --> 00:44:12.320
The difference between top
quartile and bottom quartile

00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:14.850
is 0.50% per annum.

00:44:14.850 --> 00:44:16.550
Almost nothing.

00:44:16.550 --> 00:44:20.880
All bond managers are jammed
together right in the heart of

00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:25.830
the distribution, because if
they were out there making

00:44:25.830 --> 00:44:28.740
crazy bets and generating
returns that were

00:44:28.740 --> 00:44:32.880
fundamentally different from the
market, they'd be in that

00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:36.110
category of, yes, sure, it's
great, when it works, but when

00:44:36.110 --> 00:44:38.150
it doesn't, you're dead.

00:44:38.150 --> 00:44:41.070
Large cap stocks, less
efficiently priced than bonds,

00:44:41.070 --> 00:44:43.820
but still pretty efficiently
priced, two percentage points

00:44:43.820 --> 00:44:45.460
per annum difference first to
third [correction: fourth]

00:44:45.460 --> 00:44:47.130
quartile over 10 years.

00:44:47.130 --> 00:44:50.010
Foreign stocks, less efficiently
priced than those

00:44:50.010 --> 00:44:53.890
in the domestic markets,
four points per year.

00:44:53.890 --> 00:44:57.030
Then you move into the hedge
fund world, the part of the

00:44:57.030 --> 00:45:01.590
hedge fund world that we call
absolute return at Yale, 7.1

00:45:01.590 --> 00:45:03.120
percentage points, first to
third [correction: fourth]

00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:04.160
quartile.

00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:06.840
Real estate, much less
efficiently priced than

00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:10.290
marketable securities, 9.3
percentage points, top to

00:45:10.290 --> 00:45:12.010
bottom quartile.

00:45:12.010 --> 00:45:18.960
Leveraged buyouts, 13.7%
difference, top quartile to

00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:19.450
bottom quartile.

00:45:19.450 --> 00:45:25.670
And the venture capital, 43.2
percentage points difference,

00:45:25.670 --> 00:45:26.980
top to bottom quartile.

00:45:26.980 --> 00:45:33.220
So, the measure that we have
here of market inefficiency

00:45:33.220 --> 00:45:38.920
points us toward spending our
time and energy trying to find

00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:41.400
the best venture capital
managers, trying to find the

00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:45.230
best leveraged buyout managers,
and spending far

00:45:45.230 --> 00:45:49.650
less of our time and energy
trying to beat the bond market

00:45:49.650 --> 00:45:50.760
or beat the stock market.

00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:53.340
Because, even if you win there,
even if you end up in

00:45:53.340 --> 00:45:56.600
the top quartile, you're not
adding an enormous amount of

00:45:56.600 --> 00:46:00.910
value relative to what you would
have had, if you just

00:46:00.910 --> 00:46:03.890
would have bought the market.

00:46:03.890 --> 00:46:08.230
So, with that background, let's
revisit the criticisms

00:46:08.230 --> 00:46:12.150
that Barron's leveled
at the Yale Model

00:46:12.150 --> 00:46:14.340
and the Swensen Approach.

00:46:14.340 --> 00:46:17.950
First of all, they talk about
diversification failing.

00:46:17.950 --> 00:46:25.880
And the fact is that, in a
panic, only two things matter:

00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:28.540
risk and safety.

00:46:28.540 --> 00:46:33.900
And I saw this in 1987, saw it
in 1998 with the collapse of

00:46:33.900 --> 00:46:38.070
Long Term Capital, and saw it in
2008 in a way that was even

00:46:38.070 --> 00:46:41.580
more profound than
in '87 and '98.

00:46:41.580 --> 00:46:47.490
Investors sold everything that
had risk associated with it to

00:46:47.490 --> 00:46:49.720
buy U.S. Treasuries.

00:46:49.720 --> 00:46:51.760
Safety was all that mattered.

00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:57.880
And of course, in that narrow
window of time,

00:46:57.880 --> 00:47:01.150
diversification does fail.

00:47:01.150 --> 00:47:05.710
The only diversification that
would matter in that instance

00:47:05.710 --> 00:47:09.770
is owning U.S. Treasuries.

00:47:09.770 --> 00:47:12.890
But if you owned a substantial
amount of U.S. Treasury bonds

00:47:12.890 --> 00:47:14.950
-- and what's a substantial
amount?

00:47:14.950 --> 00:47:18.910
25%, 30%, 35% of
your portfolio.

00:47:18.910 --> 00:47:23.540
Then, under normal
circumstances, under the

00:47:23.540 --> 00:47:27.260
circumstances, in which we live
most of our lives, you're

00:47:27.260 --> 00:47:29.890
paying a huge opportunity
cost.

00:47:29.890 --> 00:47:35.910
So, you could have a portfolio
with 30% in U.S. Treasuries,

00:47:35.910 --> 00:47:38.940
and year in and year out you
would pay this opportunity

00:47:38.940 --> 00:47:42.400
cost. And then, when the crisis
comes, you can be happy

00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:47.730
for six or 12 or 18 months, and
then you go back to paying

00:47:47.730 --> 00:47:52.160
the opportunity cost. And I
would argue that, if you

00:47:52.160 --> 00:47:59.430
expand your time horizon to a
sensible length of time, that

00:47:59.430 --> 00:48:04.100
the strategy, where you hold
relatively little in the high

00:48:04.100 --> 00:48:07.710
opportunity cost U.S.
Treasuries, is the best

00:48:07.710 --> 00:48:12.410
strategy for a long-term
investor.

00:48:12.410 --> 00:48:16.310
And there are those, who say
that, well, diversification

00:48:16.310 --> 00:48:17.970
doesn't protect you in
times of crisis.

00:48:17.970 --> 00:48:18.670
What does it matter?

00:48:18.670 --> 00:48:21.030
Why would you want
to diversify?

00:48:21.030 --> 00:48:22.280
Well, think about Japan.

00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:29.150
If you were local Japanese
investor and you wanted to

00:48:29.150 --> 00:48:32.420
have an equity bias in your
portfolio -- so, you owned

00:48:32.420 --> 00:48:34.730
lots of Japanese stocks --

00:48:34.730 --> 00:48:38.740
in 1989, at the end of the year,
the Nikkei closed at

00:48:38.740 --> 00:48:41.640
about 38,000.

00:48:41.640 --> 00:48:44.420
At the end of 2009, 20
years later, the

00:48:44.420 --> 00:48:47.630
Nikkei closed at 10,500.

00:48:47.630 --> 00:48:51.530
So, with your long time horizon
and equity bias in

00:48:51.530 --> 00:48:53.730
your portfolio over
two decades, you

00:48:53.730 --> 00:48:56.120
would have lost 73%.

00:48:56.120 --> 00:49:01.640
So, diversification makes an
enormous amount of sense in

00:49:01.640 --> 00:49:08.390
the long run, even if there are
occasional panics, where

00:49:08.390 --> 00:49:12.040
you're disappointed that the
diversified approach that you

00:49:12.040 --> 00:49:18.930
had to managing the portfolio
didn't produce results.

00:49:18.930 --> 00:49:21.430
The second criticism,
overemphasis on alternatives.

00:49:21.430 --> 00:49:24.780
Let's just look at the last
decade in Yale's portfolio.

00:49:24.780 --> 00:49:29.700
Over the 10 years ended June
30, 2010, domestic equities

00:49:29.700 --> 00:49:34.730
produced returns of negative
0.7% per year, bonds produced

00:49:34.730 --> 00:49:39.260
returns of 5.9% per year.

00:49:39.260 --> 00:49:42.270
Let's look at the alternatives,
as opposed to

00:49:42.270 --> 00:49:44.400
domestic marketable
securities.

00:49:44.400 --> 00:49:48.900
Private equity, 6.2% per year,
real estate, 6.9% per year,

00:49:48.900 --> 00:49:53.880
absolute return, 11.1% per year,
timber, 12.1% per year,

00:49:53.880 --> 00:49:57.210
and oil and gas,
24.7% per year.

00:49:57.210 --> 00:50:00.990
I think the numbers speak
for themselves.

00:50:00.990 --> 00:50:06.770
If you have a sensibly long
time horizon, these basic

00:50:06.770 --> 00:50:09.610
principles of equity
orientation and

00:50:09.610 --> 00:50:13.310
diversification make an enormous
amount of sense.

00:50:13.310 --> 00:50:19.330
And if you look at the bottom
line, which is performance,

00:50:19.330 --> 00:50:26.200
when I began managing Yale's
endowment in 1985, it was less

00:50:26.200 --> 00:50:27.750
than $1 billion.

00:50:27.750 --> 00:50:31.970
The amount that we distributed
to support Yale's operations

00:50:31.970 --> 00:50:35.630
that year was $45
million dollars.

00:50:35.630 --> 00:50:40.250
For the year ended June 30,
2010, the endowment stood at a

00:50:40.250 --> 00:50:42.780
little bit above $16
billion dollars.

00:50:42.780 --> 00:50:44.850
The amount that we distributed
to Yale's

00:50:44.850 --> 00:50:47.650
operations was $1.1 billion.

00:50:47.650 --> 00:50:52.920
So, an enormous positive
change over 25 years.

00:50:52.920 --> 00:50:56.550
If you look at Yale's
performance over the last 10

00:50:56.550 --> 00:51:01.430
years, it's still better
than that of any other

00:51:01.430 --> 00:51:05.300
institutional investor,
8.9% per annum.

00:51:05.300 --> 00:51:08.120
And that compares to an average
for colleges and

00:51:08.120 --> 00:51:11.920
universities of about
4.0% per annum.

00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:18.040
And that translates into $7.9
billion of added value,

00:51:18.040 --> 00:51:20.810
relative to where we would have
been had we had average

00:51:20.810 --> 00:51:22.490
returns over the
past 10 years.

00:51:22.490 --> 00:51:27.125
And the comparable numbers for
20 years are Yale at 13.1% per

00:51:27.125 --> 00:51:32.810
annum, again, the best record of
any institutional investor

00:51:32.810 --> 00:51:34.450
in the United States.

00:51:34.450 --> 00:51:37.790
Relative to an average for
colleges and universities of

00:51:37.790 --> 00:51:43.850
8.8% per annum, and $12.1
billion of value added.

00:51:43.850 --> 00:51:49.270
So, the slings and arrows
of outrageous fortune.

00:51:52.060 --> 00:51:58.240
I would suggest that the
Barron's articles really took

00:51:58.240 --> 00:52:01.810
far too short a time horizon.

00:52:01.810 --> 00:52:05.870
And looking at Yale's
performance and then looking

00:52:05.870 --> 00:52:11.990
at the Yale Model, which
emphasizes a portfolio that's

00:52:11.990 --> 00:52:17.020
well diversified and has
a strong equity bias.

00:52:17.020 --> 00:52:20.960
And I think if we were back in
this room five years or 10

00:52:20.960 --> 00:52:26.060
years from now, we'll see that
the portfolio will continue to

00:52:26.060 --> 00:52:30.130
produce the same kind of strong
long-run results as it

00:52:30.130 --> 00:52:33.070
has for the past 10, 20 years.

00:52:33.070 --> 00:52:36.110
With that, I'd love to answer
any questions that you might

00:52:36.110 --> 00:52:59.330
have.

00:52:59.330 --> 00:53:02.480
STUDENT: How is your job similar
or different to what a

00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:04.260
hedge fund manager would do?

00:53:04.260 --> 00:53:07.530
And what are the concerns that
an institutional investor has

00:53:07.530 --> 00:53:11.750
to have, versus a personal
investor, a wealthy

00:53:11.750 --> 00:53:13.685
individual?

00:53:13.685 --> 00:53:16.610
PROFESSOR DAVID SWENSEN: So,
the fundamental difference

00:53:16.610 --> 00:53:20.990
between what we would be doing
at Yale, as opposed to a hedge

00:53:20.990 --> 00:53:26.570
fund manager, or a domestic
stock manager, or a buyout

00:53:26.570 --> 00:53:30.240
manager, is that we're
essentially one step removed

00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:33.080
from the security selection
process.

00:53:33.080 --> 00:53:38.500
So, our job is to find the best
hedge fund managers, find

00:53:38.500 --> 00:53:41.920
the best domestic equity
managers, find the best buyout

00:53:41.920 --> 00:53:47.430
managers, and put together
partnerships that work for

00:53:47.430 --> 00:53:52.620
them and work for
the university.

00:53:52.620 --> 00:53:56.970
And it's a tricky thing to
do, because, in the funds

00:53:56.970 --> 00:54:02.800
management world, there are
all sorts of issues with

00:54:02.800 --> 00:54:04.450
respect to what economists
call the

00:54:04.450 --> 00:54:07.840
principal-agent problem.

00:54:07.840 --> 00:54:16.440
And we're principals for the
university engaging agents,

00:54:16.440 --> 00:54:20.710
the hedge fund managers or the
buyout managers, and trying to

00:54:20.710 --> 00:54:26.600
find ways to get those agents
to act primarily in the

00:54:26.600 --> 00:54:31.310
university's interests, to get
rid of those agency issues.

00:54:31.310 --> 00:54:37.420
And it's a challenge, but a
fascinating challenge, because

00:54:37.420 --> 00:54:42.720
in doing this, you end up
meeting an enormous number of

00:54:42.720 --> 00:54:48.510
incredibly intelligent,
engaged, thoughtful

00:54:48.510 --> 00:54:51.280
individuals that are
involved in the

00:54:51.280 --> 00:54:53.100
funds management business.

00:54:53.100 --> 00:54:58.540
And it's a fabulous career, at
least from my perspective,

00:54:58.540 --> 00:55:02.210
because I get to do this and
do it to benefit one of the

00:55:02.210 --> 00:55:05.680
world's great institutions,
Yale.

00:55:05.680 --> 00:55:10.730
In terms of differences between
individuals and

00:55:10.730 --> 00:55:14.690
institutions, there's some
structural differences.

00:55:14.690 --> 00:55:16.300
We don't pay taxes.

00:55:16.300 --> 00:55:21.350
And taxes are an enormously
important determinant of

00:55:21.350 --> 00:55:24.650
investment outcomes
for individuals.

00:55:24.650 --> 00:55:29.510
As an individual, you want to
avoid paying taxes or defer

00:55:29.510 --> 00:55:33.770
paying taxes, because taxes
are just a huge drag on

00:55:33.770 --> 00:55:34.560
investment returns.

00:55:34.560 --> 00:55:37.800
We don't have to worry about
that, by and large, in

00:55:37.800 --> 00:55:40.830
managing Yale's portfolio.

00:55:40.830 --> 00:55:44.950
Another very fundamental
difference has to do with the

00:55:44.950 --> 00:55:47.930
resources that we
can bring to the

00:55:47.930 --> 00:55:49.890
investment management problem.

00:55:49.890 --> 00:55:55.080
Most individuals, and many
institutions, just don't have

00:55:55.080 --> 00:56:02.650
the wherewithal, either the
background or the time, to

00:56:02.650 --> 00:56:06.020
make high quality active
management decisions.

00:56:06.020 --> 00:56:08.580
Markets are incredibly tough.

00:56:08.580 --> 00:56:13.850
Beating those markets is an

00:56:13.850 --> 00:56:16.320
incredibly difficult challenge.

00:56:16.320 --> 00:56:21.790
And doing it, by spending a
couple of hours on a weekend

00:56:21.790 --> 00:56:25.560
once a month, isn't
going to cut it.

00:56:25.560 --> 00:56:31.130
And so at Yale, we've got
20, 21, 22 investment

00:56:31.130 --> 00:56:34.320
professionals, who are
dedicating their careers to

00:56:34.320 --> 00:56:36.380
trying to make these high
quality active management

00:56:36.380 --> 00:56:40.600
decisions, so we can go out
and have a decent shot at

00:56:40.600 --> 00:56:42.880
beating the domestic stock
market and the foreign stock

00:56:42.880 --> 00:56:46.330
market, and putting together a
superior portfolio of venture

00:56:46.330 --> 00:56:50.920
capital partnerships and
hedge fund managers.

00:56:50.920 --> 00:56:58.130
And over the past five, 10, 15,
20 years, we've produced

00:56:58.130 --> 00:56:59.460
market-beating results.

00:56:59.460 --> 00:57:04.670
In contrast, an individual has
almost no chance of beating

00:57:04.670 --> 00:57:06.390
the market.

00:57:06.390 --> 00:57:09.090
So I've written two books,
one, Pioneering Portfolio

00:57:09.090 --> 00:57:12.200
Management that talks about
how it is that, I think,

00:57:12.200 --> 00:57:15.270
institutions should manage
their portfolio.

00:57:15.270 --> 00:57:17.660
And if they've got the resources
-- and it's not just

00:57:17.660 --> 00:57:19.960
dollars, it's the human
resources --

00:57:19.960 --> 00:57:21.640
to make those high quality
decisions.

00:57:21.640 --> 00:57:25.480
They can follow what Barron's
referred to as the Yale Model

00:57:25.480 --> 00:57:27.220
or the Swensen Approach.

00:57:27.220 --> 00:57:32.840
But the book that I've written
ostensibly for individuals,

00:57:32.840 --> 00:57:36.990
but it's really individuals and
institutions that don't

00:57:36.990 --> 00:57:42.390
have the same resources that
Yale does to make these high

00:57:42.390 --> 00:57:45.850
quality active decisions.

00:57:45.850 --> 00:57:48.750
That book says, basically, what
you should do, is come up

00:57:48.750 --> 00:57:53.190
with a sensible asset allocation
policy, and, then,

00:57:53.190 --> 00:57:58.510
implement it using index funds,
which are low-cost ways

00:57:58.510 --> 00:58:00.280
of mimicking the market.

00:58:00.280 --> 00:58:04.380
And oh, by the way, because they
have very low turnover,

00:58:04.380 --> 00:58:08.590
generate very little in terms
of tax consequences for the

00:58:08.590 --> 00:58:09.950
holders of those funds.

00:58:09.950 --> 00:58:15.400
So, it's kind of an interesting
world, where the

00:58:15.400 --> 00:58:20.430
right solution is either one
extreme or the other extreme.

00:58:20.430 --> 00:58:25.520
You're either completely
passive or you're

00:58:25.520 --> 00:58:28.510
aggressively active.

00:58:28.510 --> 00:58:32.280
But as in most things, most
people are kind of in the

00:58:32.280 --> 00:58:33.550
middle, right?

00:58:33.550 --> 00:58:37.330
They're neither aggressively
active nor completely passive,

00:58:37.330 --> 00:58:39.740
but in the middle you lose.

00:58:39.740 --> 00:58:44.360
Because you end up paying high
fees for mediocre active

00:58:44.360 --> 00:58:48.970
results, and that's where most
people end up, and most

00:58:48.970 --> 00:58:50.220
institutions.

00:59:03.390 --> 00:59:07.630
STUDENT: Hi, so, my question
is about -- given you were

00:59:07.630 --> 00:59:11.815
talking about your equity
orientation and bias, and

00:59:11.815 --> 00:59:14.920
given what's going on right
now with the stock market,

00:59:14.920 --> 00:59:16.180
just what your views are.

00:59:16.180 --> 00:59:19.300
Whether or not the stock market
is currently expensive,

00:59:19.300 --> 00:59:22.430
and whether or not you have any
money in tech stocks, with

00:59:22.430 --> 00:59:23.940
all the valuations and
IPOs that have been

00:59:23.940 --> 00:59:26.070
going in that space.

00:59:26.070 --> 00:59:27.060
What do you think about that?

00:59:27.060 --> 00:59:31.620
And also, what would you do in
terms of investing it in

00:59:31.620 --> 00:59:33.640
response to what your view is?

00:59:33.640 --> 00:59:35.890
Thank you.

00:59:35.890 --> 00:59:39.410
PROFESSOR DAVID SWENSEN: So, one
of the great things about

00:59:39.410 --> 00:59:44.620
having a diversified portfolio
is that you can worry less

00:59:44.620 --> 00:59:48.660
about the relative level of
valuation of various assets in

00:59:48.660 --> 00:59:52.800
which you invest. So, if you
go back to the mid-'80s and

00:59:52.800 --> 00:59:58.420
you've got a portfolio that's
50% in domestic stocks, you

00:59:58.420 --> 01:00:01.380
have to worry a lot about the
valuation of that portfolio,

01:00:01.380 --> 01:00:03.980
because half of your
assets are in that

01:00:03.980 --> 01:00:05.460
single asset class.

01:00:05.460 --> 01:00:07.960
But if you've got a
well-diversified portfolio

01:00:07.960 --> 01:00:11.690
with, let's say, minimum
allocation of 5% to 10%, and

01:00:11.690 --> 01:00:16.180
now a maximum allocation of 25%
to 30% in an individual

01:00:16.180 --> 01:00:22.120
asset class, the relative
valuation of each of those

01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:25.460
asset classes matters less.

01:00:25.460 --> 01:00:31.947
And there's another
nice aspect to

01:00:31.947 --> 01:00:34.890
a rebalancing policy.

01:00:34.890 --> 01:00:40.790
If you set up your targets and
you faithfully adhere to

01:00:40.790 --> 01:00:42.040
those targets --

01:00:45.110 --> 01:00:48.140
Suppose, the domestic equities
have poor relative

01:00:48.140 --> 01:00:49.270
performance.

01:00:49.270 --> 01:00:53.360
Well, then you're going to buy
domestic equities to get them

01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:56.960
back up to target, selling
whatever it is that had

01:00:56.960 --> 01:00:59.980
superior relative performance
to fund those purchases.

01:00:59.980 --> 01:01:00.725
And vice versa.

01:01:00.725 --> 01:01:04.020
If domestic equities have great
relative performance,

01:01:04.020 --> 01:01:09.190
you'll be selling to get back
to your long-term target and

01:01:09.190 --> 01:01:12.790
buying other assets that have
shown poor relative

01:01:12.790 --> 01:01:14.050
performance.

01:01:14.050 --> 01:01:17.860
So, if you're in a circumstance,
where domestic

01:01:17.860 --> 01:01:23.370
stocks are expensive, where
you're selling into this

01:01:23.370 --> 01:01:28.300
superior relative performance
that the domestic equities are

01:01:28.300 --> 01:01:32.950
exhibiting, thereby maintaining
your risk exposure

01:01:32.950 --> 01:01:41.320
at a level that's consistent
with what's implicit in your

01:01:41.320 --> 01:01:43.010
policy asset allocation.

01:01:43.010 --> 01:01:47.570
So, that's kind of a long way
of saying, that, if somebody

01:01:47.570 --> 01:01:51.310
asked me whether stocks are
expensive or cheap, my first

01:01:51.310 --> 01:01:53.260
line of defense, it doesn't
really matter all that much to

01:01:53.260 --> 01:01:54.960
me, because we're
well-diversified and because

01:01:54.960 --> 01:01:58.220
we do a great job
of rebalancing.

01:01:58.220 --> 01:02:02.240
But the reality is that those
questions are just incredibly

01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:04.700
tough to answer.

01:02:04.700 --> 01:02:08.340
If they were easier to answer,
I guess I'd be much more

01:02:08.340 --> 01:02:14.160
excited about market timing as
a way to generate returns.

01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:17.950
In terms of the second question,
with respect to

01:02:17.950 --> 01:02:24.320
technology, Yale's had a
long-standing commitment to

01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:25.970
venture capital.

01:02:25.970 --> 01:02:30.500
And over the decades, it's
produced extraordinary returns

01:02:30.500 --> 01:02:32.010
for the university.

01:02:32.010 --> 01:02:38.240
And we continue to have a
world-class group of venture

01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:38.870
capitalists.

01:02:38.870 --> 01:02:44.700
We've got exposure to companies
like LinkedIn and

01:02:44.700 --> 01:02:46.550
Facebook and Groupon.

01:02:46.550 --> 01:02:51.540
And I hope that this wave of
IPOs that people are writing

01:02:51.540 --> 01:02:54.270
about in the press actually
occurs, because that would be

01:02:54.270 --> 01:02:57.730
very good for the university's
portfolio.

01:02:57.730 --> 01:02:59.200
It's been a long time, right?

01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:03.630
We benefited enormously in the
internet bubble in the late

01:03:03.630 --> 01:03:08.120
90s, and the last decade
has been a bit fallow.

01:03:08.120 --> 01:03:11.140
We also find, on the marketable
securities side,

01:03:11.140 --> 01:03:17.300
that technology stocks tend to
be less efficiently priced

01:03:17.300 --> 01:03:20.180
than many other securities.

01:03:20.180 --> 01:03:24.430
And so, we have a manager that
is heavily focused on

01:03:24.430 --> 01:03:27.120
information technology stocks
and another manager that's

01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:29.760
very heavily focused on
biotechnology stocks.

01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:33.590
And both those managers have
produced very handsome

01:03:33.590 --> 01:03:35.130
absolute and relative returns.

01:03:35.130 --> 01:03:37.580
And that's an important
part of our

01:03:37.580 --> 01:03:38.830
domestic equity strategy.

01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:49.970
STUDENT: Thanks for coming.

01:03:53.110 --> 01:03:56.300
So, in recent years, the number
of hedge funds, private

01:03:56.300 --> 01:03:58.590
equity firms, has gone up.

01:03:58.590 --> 01:04:02.030
And I wasn't sure, how that's
changed the efficiencies of

01:04:02.030 --> 01:04:05.920
these alternative asset
allocation markets.

01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:08.210
And if it's changed the
efficiencies, how have you

01:04:08.210 --> 01:04:11.940
changed your investment
philosophies?

01:04:11.940 --> 01:04:15.150
And I was wondering, also,
what are the structural

01:04:15.150 --> 01:04:18.820
patterns of these markets that
would prevent the market from

01:04:18.820 --> 01:04:23.520
becoming very efficient, even if
there are a lot hedge funds

01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:25.090
and a lot of funds of funds.

01:04:25.090 --> 01:04:27.100
Thanks.

01:04:27.100 --> 01:04:30.090
PROFESSOR DAVID SWENSEN: That's
a really good question.

01:04:30.090 --> 01:04:34.190
I think, the most fundamental
issue with the explosion of

01:04:34.190 --> 01:04:37.630
hedge funds and the explosion of
private equity funds has to

01:04:37.630 --> 01:04:41.170
do with this negative-sum game
that we were talking about.

01:04:41.170 --> 01:04:47.700
If you go back to the 1950s,
the most common way that

01:04:47.700 --> 01:04:51.230
institutional assets were
managed would be for an

01:04:51.230 --> 01:04:54.790
institution like Yale
to go to a bank like

01:04:54.790 --> 01:04:57.570
Chemical Bank or JP Morgan.

01:04:57.570 --> 01:05:03.740
And they would pay a small
fraction of 1% for a

01:05:03.740 --> 01:05:07.705
reasonably diversified
portfolio, stocks, bonds, and

01:05:07.705 --> 01:05:10.530
there'd probably be some foreign
stocks, and some

01:05:10.530 --> 01:05:11.410
domestic stocks.

01:05:11.410 --> 01:05:16.750
But the leakage from the
system was very small.

01:05:16.750 --> 01:05:20.760
You look at hedge funds and
private equity funds, they're

01:05:20.760 --> 01:05:24.910
essentially dealing with the
same set of securities that an

01:05:24.910 --> 01:05:28.910
institution used to pay two
tenths of a percent a year, or

01:05:28.910 --> 01:05:35.110
three tenths of a percent a
year for admittedly sleepy

01:05:35.110 --> 01:05:37.000
bank management.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:38.550
But it's the same set
of securities.

01:05:38.550 --> 01:05:43.160
Now, those securities are traded
in a hedge fund format,

01:05:43.160 --> 01:05:47.840
or taken in a private
equity fund format.

01:05:47.840 --> 01:05:53.350
And the fees that you are paying
are a point, a point

01:05:53.350 --> 01:05:56.510
and a half, two points.

01:05:56.510 --> 01:06:00.010
The typical ''two and 20.''
And you're paying a

01:06:00.010 --> 01:06:03.120
significant percentage
of the profits.

01:06:03.120 --> 01:06:07.550
The 20 in the ''two and 20.''
Think about that.

01:06:07.550 --> 01:06:14.120
The leakage from the system that
goes to Wall Street is

01:06:14.120 --> 01:06:17.490
enormous, compared to what it
was 10 years ago, or 20 years

01:06:17.490 --> 01:06:18.900
ago, or 30 years ago.

01:06:18.900 --> 01:06:25.830
So, there's that much less
left for us as investors.

01:06:25.830 --> 01:06:30.780
And I think that has huge
consequences for endowments,

01:06:30.780 --> 01:06:35.230
foundations, pension plans,
institutions of all stripes.

01:06:35.230 --> 01:06:38.050
And to the extent that
individuals get exposure to

01:06:38.050 --> 01:06:40.140
these types of assets -- and
they're largely wealthy

01:06:40.140 --> 01:06:44.020
individuals that end up getting
the exposure --

01:06:44.020 --> 01:06:50.466
they're going to suffer the same
consequences of this huge

01:06:50.466 --> 01:06:54.200
leakage of higher fees
and the profits

01:06:54.200 --> 01:06:57.870
interest to Wall Street.

01:06:57.870 --> 01:07:02.120
The question as to whether or
not the money flowing to hedge

01:07:02.120 --> 01:07:04.485
funds is going to make the
markets more efficient and

01:07:04.485 --> 01:07:05.740
take away opportunities --

01:07:05.740 --> 01:07:07.370
I don't worry too
much about that.

01:07:07.370 --> 01:07:11.140
I think, the best talent is
going to hedge funds, because

01:07:11.140 --> 01:07:15.110
if they're in a long only
domestic equity environment,

01:07:15.110 --> 01:07:17.570
maybe they can charge three
quarters of a percent or a

01:07:17.570 --> 01:07:20.400
percent, or if they're in the
mutual fund world, maybe they

01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:23.430
charge a percent and a half,
or something like that.

01:07:23.430 --> 01:07:27.300
Well, you'd rather have ''two
and 20'' than 0.75, right?

01:07:27.300 --> 01:07:28.510
That's easy.

01:07:28.510 --> 01:07:31.810
So, there's a huge migration
of talent to

01:07:31.810 --> 01:07:35.200
the hedge fund world.

01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:39.800
But what I care about, when
I look at the degree of

01:07:39.800 --> 01:07:42.200
investment opportunities, is
this dispersion we talked

01:07:42.200 --> 01:07:48.190
about, and I haven't seen the
dispersion of results, top

01:07:48.190 --> 01:07:51.490
quartile to bottom quartile,
compress at all.

01:07:51.490 --> 01:07:57.230
So, I don't think, that we're
increasing the efficiency of

01:07:57.230 --> 01:07:58.600
the pricing of assets.

01:07:58.600 --> 01:08:01.860
I still need to go out there and
be able to identify people

01:08:01.860 --> 01:08:06.430
in the top quartile or top
decile, so that we can win

01:08:06.430 --> 01:08:11.520
relative to the markets, after
adjustment for the

01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:13.090
risk that we take.

01:08:13.090 --> 01:08:19.229
So, as long as we have plenty of
dispersion in the results,

01:08:19.229 --> 01:08:22.894
it's still an interesting
activity for us to pursue.

01:08:29.914 --> 01:08:31.855
STUDENT: Can I ask?

01:08:31.855 --> 01:08:32.950
PROFESSOR DAVID SWENSEN:
It better be good,

01:08:32.950 --> 01:08:35.063
it's the last question.

01:08:35.063 --> 01:08:38.590
STUDENT: I'll try.

01:08:38.590 --> 01:08:41.200
So, my question is about
performance of the Yale

01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:47.260
portfolio, and we heard that
it grew from less than $1

01:08:47.260 --> 01:08:49.810
billion -- but close to
it, apparently --

01:08:49.810 --> 01:08:54.319
in 1985, to $16 billion, which
is very impressive.

01:08:54.319 --> 01:08:59.170
And it's documented in
newspapers, it's online,

01:08:59.170 --> 01:09:02.080
Wikipedia, Professor
Shiller introduced

01:09:02.080 --> 01:09:04.979
you with these facts.

01:09:04.979 --> 01:09:07.800
But what about the
Sharpe ratio?

01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:12.850
And why do you think that people
talk more about total

01:09:12.850 --> 01:09:16.674
returns than, say,
the Sharpe ratio?

01:09:16.674 --> 01:09:19.069
PROFESSOR DAVID SWENSEN: So, I
think that one of the things

01:09:19.069 --> 01:09:23.229
that needs to happen in the
funds management world is,

01:09:23.229 --> 01:09:26.609
that we need to have better
measures of risk.

01:09:26.609 --> 01:09:31.420
And so, one of the reasons,
why I don't talk about the

01:09:31.420 --> 01:09:34.764
Sharpe ratio, is, that just
looking at standard deviation

01:09:34.764 --> 01:09:41.330
of returns doesn't capture
risk in a way that is

01:09:41.330 --> 01:09:41.950
meaningful.

01:09:41.950 --> 01:09:44.620
I mean, I've seen other people
do an analysis of the Yale

01:09:44.620 --> 01:09:47.430
portfolio, and show relative
Sharpe ratios.

01:09:47.430 --> 01:09:52.890
And, obviously, because our
returns have been so good, if

01:09:52.890 --> 01:09:57.810
you just look at the pattern
of those returns, we end up

01:09:57.810 --> 01:10:04.650
scoring high when looking at
Sharpe ratios across different

01:10:04.650 --> 01:10:06.340
institutional portfolios.

01:10:06.340 --> 01:10:16.770
But the risks that exist in the
portfolio aren't really

01:10:16.770 --> 01:10:21.650
captured by the standard
deviation of the returns.

01:10:21.650 --> 01:10:27.740
Just a quick example: If you
look at real estate, or

01:10:27.740 --> 01:10:33.150
timber, or even any of our
illiquid assets, they're

01:10:33.150 --> 01:10:36.470
appraised relatively
infrequently.

01:10:36.470 --> 01:10:42.260
There tends to be a huge
stability bias in the

01:10:42.260 --> 01:10:43.790
appraisals.

01:10:43.790 --> 01:10:49.050
If somebody looks at a piece of
real estate 12 months ago,

01:10:49.050 --> 01:10:52.540
six months ago, and today,
they're likely to see pretty

01:10:52.540 --> 01:10:55.890
much the same thing that they
saw over that period.

01:10:55.890 --> 01:10:58.790
You can compare and contrast
that to the volatility they've

01:10:58.790 --> 01:11:01.170
got in the stock market.

01:11:01.170 --> 01:11:04.740
I think Bob Shiller deserves
credit for coining the term

01:11:04.740 --> 01:11:09.340
"excess volatility." There's no
question that stock prices

01:11:09.340 --> 01:11:15.370
are way more variable than they
need to be to adjust for

01:11:15.370 --> 01:11:17.720
changes in the underlying
fundamentals.

01:11:17.720 --> 01:11:20.470
So, if you've got a portfolio
that's largely marketable

01:11:20.470 --> 01:11:24.320
securities, you're going to
see a lot more standard

01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:28.160
deviation of returns than if
you've got one of illiquid

01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:32.380
assets, where you've got this
stability built in because of

01:11:32.380 --> 01:11:35.890
the appraisal nature of
the valuation process.

01:11:35.890 --> 01:11:42.010
And if you end up comparing
those two portfolios, one

01:11:42.010 --> 01:11:44.310
dominated by marketable
securities, one dominated by

01:11:44.310 --> 01:11:48.800
private assets, you're going to
end up with measures that

01:11:48.800 --> 01:11:51.360
are apples and oranges.

01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:52.130
Thank you very much.

01:11:52.130 --> 01:11:53.660

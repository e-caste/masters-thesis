00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:07.713
Prof: So I'll tell you a
little bit about Harold Bloom's

00:00:07.713 --> 00:00:10.700
career later in the lecture.
 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.180
Those of you who know How to
Read a Poem,

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:16.729
the books on religion,
Shakespeare and the

00:00:16.729 --> 00:00:20.871
Invention of the Human,
and perhaps only know those

00:00:20.871 --> 00:00:24.250
books, may feel a little
surprised at finding him on a

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.954
literary theory syllabus,
but the great outpouring of

00:00:27.954 --> 00:00:31.390
work beginning with The
Anxiety of Influence,

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:33.810
A Map of Misreading,
Poetry and Repression,

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:38.316
and a great many other books in
the seventies put Bloom in the

00:00:38.316 --> 00:00:42.750
very midst of the theoretical
controversies then swirling.

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.560
He was associated with the
so-called Yale School.

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:50.245
In fact, he was willing to put
his name as editor and also a

00:00:50.245 --> 00:00:53.993
contributor on a volume that was
called Deconstruction and

00:00:53.993 --> 00:00:56.438
Criticism.
I think though that,

00:00:56.438 --> 00:00:59.962
even in reading what you have
before you, you can see how

00:00:59.962 --> 00:01:03.548
relatively little Bloom has to
do with deconstruction.

00:01:03.548 --> 00:01:09.715
Certainly in his more recent
career he's distanced himself

00:01:09.715 --> 00:01:11.230
from theory.
 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:14.322
He hasn't really changed his
views of anything,

00:01:14.322 --> 00:01:18.492
although he doesn't any longer
read poems through the machinery

00:01:18.492 --> 00:01:20.780
of the six revisionary ratios.
 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.775
Perhaps I should stop there and
say the six revisionary ratios

00:01:25.775 --> 00:01:27.659
won't be on the test.
 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:28.879
&gt;
 

00:01:28.879 --> 00:01:32.337
Now I think that nothing could
be more exciting than to

00:01:32.337 --> 00:01:36.697
understand clinamen,
tessera, sort of kenosis,

00:01:36.697 --> 00:01:42.184
askesis, demonization,
apophrades--whoa!--and to

00:01:42.184 --> 00:01:46.310
wander in the realms of these
ideas,

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.230
and actually to use them as the
machinery for practical

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:52.477
criticism: to take a poem and to
see what you can actually do

00:01:52.477 --> 00:01:55.515
with these ideas really is,
and I'm serious,

00:01:55.515 --> 00:01:57.230
an exciting process.
 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:02.016
You may very much resent not
having these six ratios on the

00:02:02.016 --> 00:02:06.060
exam, and you may wish to hear
more about them.

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.580
You'll hear something about a
few of them in passing today,

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.490
but if you do wish to hear more
about them,

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.240
perhaps your sections will
&gt;

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.340
provide some guidance.
 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.405
In any case,
the contributions of Bloom to

00:02:25.405 --> 00:02:30.195
theory in my opinion,
and I hope to bring this out in

00:02:30.195 --> 00:02:33.348
the long run,
have primarily to do with the

00:02:33.348 --> 00:02:37.571
fact that I think he can
legitimately and authentically

00:02:37.571 --> 00:02:41.560
be called an important literary
historiographer.

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.899
That is to say,
together with people like

00:02:44.899 --> 00:02:50.241
Tynjanov and Jakobson earlier in
the course and Hans Robert Jauss

00:02:50.241 --> 00:02:54.968
later in the course,
Bloom does seriously deserve to

00:02:54.968 --> 00:02:58.120
be considered a literary
historian--

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.688
that is to say,
a person with a theory about

00:03:01.688 --> 00:03:06.090
literary history on a par with
those other figures.

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.840
This hasn't always often been
remarked.

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.567
As a matter of fact,
the general critical attitude

00:03:13.567 --> 00:03:17.598
toward Bloom is that he's
hopelessly ahistoricist,

00:03:17.598 --> 00:03:20.789
cares nothing about history,
and cares nothing about the way

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:23.438
in which the real world impinges
on literature.

00:03:23.438 --> 00:03:27.180
In a certain measure,
as we'll also see,

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.960
there is some truth in this,
but he has a powerful argument

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.872
about the relationship among
texts as they succeed each other

00:03:34.872 --> 00:03:35.848
in history.
 

00:03:35.848 --> 00:03:40.490
It's an argument which I think
really we ignore in our peril.

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:43.967
It's an important one and it is
a psychoanalytic one,

00:03:43.967 --> 00:03:48.114
which is one of the things that
places him at this point in the

00:03:48.114 --> 00:03:48.848
course.
 

00:03:48.848 --> 00:03:54.115
You'll remember the sort of
tripartition of the subject

00:03:54.115 --> 00:03:58.616
matter of our course which--
it's all headed up in the

00:03:58.616 --> 00:04:01.330
syllabus and all clearly to be
understood.

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:06.616
First we have logo genesis,
the production of literature by

00:04:06.616 --> 00:04:07.620
language.
 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.122
Then we have psychogenesis,
the production of literature by

00:04:11.122 --> 00:04:12.270
the human psyche.
 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:15.680
Then we have sociogenesis,
the production of literature by

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.372
social, economic,
and political and historical

00:04:18.372 --> 00:04:19.089
factors.
 

00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:21.985
Okay, fine, well and good,
but you may have noticed how

00:04:21.985 --> 00:04:24.879
much trouble we have had getting
into psychogenesis.

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:27.110
We keep saying we've arrived
&gt;

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.903
at psychogenesis,
but we actually continue to be

00:04:29.903 --> 00:04:32.459
working obviously with
linguistic models.

00:04:32.459 --> 00:04:36.244
Here is Lacan telling us the
unconscious resembles a

00:04:36.244 --> 00:04:39.879
language, that it's structured
like a language;

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:44.249
Brooks telling us that it's the
verbal structure arising out of

00:04:44.249 --> 00:04:47.773
the relationship between
metaphor and metonymy that

00:04:47.773 --> 00:04:50.240
constitutes the narrative text.
 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.884
We keep sitting around
twiddling our thumbs,

00:04:52.884 --> 00:04:55.714
waiting for somebody to say
something about the

00:04:55.714 --> 00:04:57.560
psychogenesis of the text.
 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:02.100
Well, Bloom brings us closer,
and he himself,

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:04.850
when he speaks of the poet in
the poet,

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:10.024
is concerned to describe what
he calls an "agon,"

00:05:10.024 --> 00:05:14.572
a psychological agon or
struggle between the belated

00:05:14.572 --> 00:05:19.480
poet and the precursor taking
place at that level in the

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.495
psyche;
but even Bloom,

00:05:21.495 --> 00:05:24.810
of course, is talking about the
relation of text to text.

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:29.189
He is talking about relations
which are arguably verbal.

00:05:29.189 --> 00:05:33.531
Verbal influence,
by the way, he always professes

00:05:33.531 --> 00:05:34.889
contempt for.
 

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:38.562
He calls it moldy fig
philology, but I think that as

00:05:38.562 --> 00:05:42.449
you study the examples of
literary influence in Bloom's

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:44.334
text,
Anxiety of Influence,

00:05:44.334 --> 00:05:46.079
A Map of Misreading and so
on,

00:05:46.079 --> 00:05:50.995
you will see that there is a
kind of dependence on verbal

00:05:50.995 --> 00:05:55.317
echo and verbal continuity,
and that his theory,

00:05:55.317 --> 00:05:58.269
the strong version of his
theory,

00:05:58.269 --> 00:06:03.096
struggles against but,
I think, nevertheless does link

00:06:03.096 --> 00:06:04.189
itself to.
 

00:06:04.189 --> 00:06:08.432
I want to move into a general
exploration of the topic of

00:06:08.432 --> 00:06:12.567
influence by talking,
in fact, about how unstable the

00:06:12.567 --> 00:06:16.528
relationship between an idea of
influence which is,

00:06:16.528 --> 00:06:21.788
let's say, psychological or
world-based and an idea of

00:06:21.788 --> 00:06:25.660
influence which is word-based
can be.

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:30.920
It's not as simple and
straightforward a distinction as

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:32.870
one might imagine.
 

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:36.935
So we linger in these
linguistic models and there's a

00:06:36.935 --> 00:06:41.315
long tradition in which the
confusion between the psychic

00:06:41.315 --> 00:06:47.255
and the linguistic is manifest,
and it has to do with the very

00:06:47.255 --> 00:06:50.800
traditional subject of
imitation.

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:56.730
Plato and Aristotle agree that
art, poetry, is an imitation.

00:06:56.730 --> 00:07:01.399
It is, both of them say,
an imitation of nature.

00:07:01.399 --> 00:07:06.173
Plato thinks it's done badly,
Aristotle thinks it's done

00:07:06.173 --> 00:07:11.470
well, but both agree that poetry
is an imitation of nature.

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:17.149
Then as time passes,
this idea of mimesis,

00:07:17.149 --> 00:07:21.680
the imitation of nature,
gradually becomes transformed

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:26.211
so that by the time you get to
the Silver Age of Roman

00:07:26.211 --> 00:07:29.910
literature,
a high-water mark of elegance

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:34.620
in the Latin language,
you have rhetorical theorists

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:40.567
like Quintilian and Cicero and
others talking not about mimesis

00:07:40.567 --> 00:07:42.636
but about--
in Latin, of

00:07:42.636 --> 00:07:46.480
course--imitatio,
seemingly the same idea.

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:49.928
They are still talking about
imitation, but the strange thing

00:07:49.928 --> 00:07:53.435
that's happened is now they're
not talking about the imitation

00:07:53.435 --> 00:07:54.699
of nature anymore.
 

00:07:54.699 --> 00:07:57.901
They're talking about the
imitation of literary models:

00:07:57.901 --> 00:08:00.949
in other words,
the imitation of language,

00:08:00.949 --> 00:08:04.834
the way in which we can
establish canons by thinking

00:08:04.834 --> 00:08:08.720
about the relationship of
particular poets and other

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:13.062
writers with a tradition of
literary expression from which

00:08:13.062 --> 00:08:14.509
they emerge.
 

00:08:14.509 --> 00:08:17.093
So this then,
imitatio,

00:08:17.093 --> 00:08:22.531
becomes a language-based theory
of influence arising seemingly

00:08:22.531 --> 00:08:26.452
spontaneously out of a
nature-based theory of

00:08:26.452 --> 00:08:27.879
influence.
 

00:08:27.879 --> 00:08:31.608
Now take a look at the first
passage on your sheet from

00:08:31.608 --> 00:08:35.200
Alexander's Pope's "Essay
on Criticism."

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:37.210
He's talking about Virgil here.
 

00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:42.129
Homer, the argument is,
has to have imitated nature.

00:08:42.129 --> 00:08:44.623
After all, there were no
literary models to imitate,

00:08:44.623 --> 00:08:47.409
so if Homer imitated anything
it must have been nature.

00:08:47.409 --> 00:08:48.350
Well, fine.
 

00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:51.700
Homer imitated nature,
but then along comes Virgil--

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:55.124
in this same period,
by the way, when rhetorical

00:08:55.124 --> 00:08:58.985
theories were redefining
imitation as the imitation of

00:08:58.985 --> 00:09:02.615
verbal models--
along comes Virgil and he says,

00:09:02.615 --> 00:09:07.399
"I'm going to write my own
national epic and you know what,

00:09:07.399 --> 00:09:09.090
I'll just sit down and write
it."

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:11.320
But then he starts looking at
Homer;

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:14.500
this is all what Pope is
thinking as he prepares to write

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:16.490
the couplet that's on your
sheet.

00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:21.480
Then he starts to write,
but then he rereads Homer.

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:25.248
At first he feels terrible
because he realized that Homer

00:09:25.248 --> 00:09:26.460
has said it all.
 

00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:28.932
There are two poems,
The Iliad and The

00:09:28.932 --> 00:09:29.669
Odyssey.
 

00:09:29.669 --> 00:09:31.320
There's nothing left to say.
 

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:38.000
Homer has covered the entire
waterfront, and so Virgil is

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.909
sort of stuck.
 

00:09:39.909 --> 00:09:41.389
What is he going to do?
 

00:09:41.389 --> 00:09:44.667
Well, what he can do,
if he can't imitate nature

00:09:44.667 --> 00:09:49.058
anymore because Homer has done
that, is he can imitate Homer.

00:09:49.058 --> 00:09:54.120
The result is that he comes to
a sort of realization that Pope

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:59.775
epitomizes in this couplet:
But when t' examine ev'ry part

00:09:59.775 --> 00:10:03.837
he came [that is to say,
every part of Homer's

00:10:03.837 --> 00:10:06.976
compositions,
every part of his own

00:10:06.976 --> 00:10:12.418
composition as he undertook to
write his own epic]

00:10:12.418 --> 00:10:17.110
Nature and Homer were,
he found, the same.

00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:22.171
So here you have emerging the
idea that to imitate nature and

00:10:22.171 --> 00:10:25.937
to imitate art--
to imitate the things of the

00:10:25.937 --> 00:10:27.913
world,
the people of the world,

00:10:27.913 --> 00:10:31.658
and to imitate language--
is part and parcel of the same

00:10:31.658 --> 00:10:32.350
process.
 

00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:37.480
To do one you necessarily and
perforce do the other.

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:40.897
That's what I mean by saying
that we're still struggling to

00:10:40.897 --> 00:10:44.080
get away from the logogenetic
&gt;

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:47.230
model to the psychogenetic
model.

00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:50.822
Even in the most traditional
expressions of how influence

00:10:50.822 --> 00:10:52.551
works,
like Pope's,

00:10:52.551 --> 00:10:56.389
we are still concerned to
distinguish,

00:10:56.389 --> 00:10:58.610
and find it very difficult to
distinguish,

00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:00.710
between nature and art.
 

00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:04.360
When Samuel Johnson,
fifty years after Pope,

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:07.750
is still saying,
"Nothing can please many,

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:11.269
or please long,
but just representations of

00:11:11.269 --> 00:11:14.791
general nature,"
he is in this idea of

00:11:14.791 --> 00:11:19.653
representations and in the idea
of general nature teetering

00:11:19.653 --> 00:11:24.850
between a sense that it's things
in the world that art imitates

00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:29.460
and it is existing literary
models that art imitates and

00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:32.730
from which art takes its cue.
 

00:11:32.730 --> 00:11:39.250
So there's a kind of collapse
then in the idea of imitation.

00:11:39.250 --> 00:11:42.177
There's a kind of a collapse,
a surprising collapse perhaps

00:11:42.177 --> 00:11:45.681
when you think about it,
between the notion of the

00:11:45.681 --> 00:11:50.820
imitation of nature and the
notion of the imitation of art.

00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:55.458
Now if we turn then to the two
texts that you've read for

00:11:55.458 --> 00:11:59.269
today, both of which are
theories of influence,

00:11:59.269 --> 00:12:04.158
you can see that T.S. Eliot,
too, is a little bit unclear as

00:12:04.158 --> 00:12:09.129
to the relationship of these two
sorts of imitation.

00:12:09.129 --> 00:12:14.350
For Eliot the individual talent
that inserts itself into,

00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:19.091
that engages with,
tradition has to cope with what

00:12:19.091 --> 00:12:23.154
Eliot calls "the mind of
Europe,"

00:12:23.154 --> 00:12:27.450
page 539,
left-hand column.

00:12:27.450 --> 00:12:31.798
I'll read a fairly extensive
passage because this is one of

00:12:31.798 --> 00:12:36.149
the most accessible summaries of
what Eliot has to say:

00:12:36.149 --> 00:12:39.565
[The poet]
must be quite aware of the

00:12:39.565 --> 00:12:45.068
obvious fact that art never
improves, but that the material

00:12:45.068 --> 00:12:48.389
of art is never quite the same.
 

00:12:48.389 --> 00:12:51.460
He must be aware that the mind
of Europe--

00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:55.099
the mind of his own country--a
mind which he learns in time to

00:12:55.099 --> 00:12:58.620
be much more important than his
own private mind…

00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:03.109
Let me just stop there and say
this seems as much unlike Bloom

00:13:03.109 --> 00:13:05.980
as it can possibly be because
Bloom,

00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:09.369
the Romantic,
is all about one's own private

00:13:09.369 --> 00:13:12.274
mind,
the struggle of the individual

00:13:12.274 --> 00:13:16.219
mind to define itself over
against all of those minds

00:13:16.219 --> 00:13:20.542
jostling for attention that
precede it to over them to the

00:13:20.542 --> 00:13:24.443
point where they are,
in effect, effaced,

00:13:24.443 --> 00:13:30.592
and the belated ego can finally
establish itself as prior to all

00:13:30.592 --> 00:13:32.350
preceding egos.
 

00:13:32.350 --> 00:13:34.332
This sort of struggle
seems--and I say

00:13:34.332 --> 00:13:36.476
"seems"
because I'm going to be

00:13:36.476 --> 00:13:38.460
lingering over this for a
while--

00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:41.500
seems to be absent from Eliot.
 

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:44.470
Eliot seems to be all about
self-effacement,

00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:48.466
about the recognition that the
mind of Europe is more important

00:13:48.466 --> 00:13:51.504
than one's own mind,
and that if one is to

00:13:51.504 --> 00:13:55.870
contribute anything as an
individual talent to tradition,

00:13:55.870 --> 00:14:01.703
that contribution has to be a
matter of the most acutely

00:14:01.703 --> 00:14:05.629
sensitive awareness of
everything,

00:14:05.629 --> 00:14:09.840
not that one is struggling to
be but that one is not.

00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:12.836
It seems, in other words,
like a very different

00:14:12.836 --> 00:14:13.750
perspective.
 

00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:17.606
To continue the passage:
… [The mind of Europe

00:14:17.606 --> 00:14:19.658
is]
a mind which changes,

00:14:19.658 --> 00:14:22.960
and that this change is a
development which abandons

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:26.972
nothing en route which does not
superannuate either Shakespeare

00:14:26.972 --> 00:14:29.789
or Homer,
or the rock drawing of the

00:14:29.789 --> 00:14:31.480
Magdalenian draftsman.
 

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:34.875
That this development,
refinement perhaps,

00:14:34.875 --> 00:14:39.264
complication certainly,
is not, from the point of view

00:14:39.264 --> 00:14:42.080
of the artist any improvement.
 

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:46.203
In other words,
the relationship between

00:14:46.203 --> 00:14:52.020
tradition and the individual
talent is a relationship of

00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:56.779
entering into a vast matrix of
literary,

00:14:56.779 --> 00:15:00.707
philosophical,
and other sorts of expression

00:15:00.707 --> 00:15:05.640
that changes and yet never
really transforms itself and

00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:11.488
certainly can't be understood as
a grand march or progress toward

00:15:11.488 --> 00:15:15.552
some great goal,
because nothing is ever lost

00:15:15.552 --> 00:15:20.038
and nothing radically innovative
can ever really be introduced.

00:15:20.038 --> 00:15:24.067
I hope you are thinking and
reflecting on a passage of this

00:15:24.067 --> 00:15:27.956
kind about a good deal that
we've passed through already:

00:15:27.956 --> 00:15:31.706
Gadamer's sense of tradition as
something which depends

00:15:31.706 --> 00:15:35.110
absolutely on the awareness of
continuity,

00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:38.980
on the willingness to meet the
past halfway,

00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:43.297
to enter into a merger of
horizons in which the past and

00:15:43.297 --> 00:15:47.850
the present can speak in an
authentic way to each other;

00:15:47.850 --> 00:15:53.294
and that in other ways this
idea, or possibly also the

00:15:53.294 --> 00:15:58.330
Russian formalist idea in its
Darwinian sense,

00:15:58.330 --> 00:16:01.649
that the dominant and the
recessive elements of any

00:16:01.649 --> 00:16:04.769
literary text are always present
at any time.

00:16:04.769 --> 00:16:08.446
It's just that they tend
perpetually in a kind of

00:16:08.446 --> 00:16:12.428
oscillation to be changing
places with each other.

00:16:12.428 --> 00:16:16.899
So the whole gamut of literary
possibility,

00:16:16.899 --> 00:16:20.706
of expressive possibility,
is, according to theories of

00:16:20.706 --> 00:16:24.782
history of this kind,
is always already there,

00:16:24.782 --> 00:16:29.845
and one's own entry into this
vast sea of expressive

00:16:29.845 --> 00:16:35.702
possibility is always a subtle
thing that certainly can't in

00:16:35.702 --> 00:16:41.857
any way be seen to showcase or
to manifest any sort of original

00:16:41.857 --> 00:16:48.509
genius as the Romantic tradition
might want to insist on it.

00:16:48.509 --> 00:16:53.845
So this is basically the
perspective of Eliot and one

00:16:53.845 --> 00:17:00.102
from which certainly you know
Bloom would obviously seem to be

00:17:00.102 --> 00:17:01.538
diverging.
 

00:17:01.538 --> 00:17:06.863
Now I want to argue that
actually there is a tremendous

00:17:06.863 --> 00:17:11.200
amount of continuity between
Eliot and Bloom,

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:15.440
and that Bloom's
&gt;

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:17.902
Anxiety of
Influence--I've never

00:17:17.902 --> 00:17:20.558
discussed this with Harold,
by the way.

00:17:20.558 --> 00:17:23.191
Those of you who may be taking
his seminars,

00:17:23.191 --> 00:17:26.680
I leave it up to you whether
you want to take this up with

00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:27.170
him.
 

00:17:27.170 --> 00:17:31.795
As I say, I leave that up to
you, but I think a strong

00:17:31.795 --> 00:17:36.147
argument can be made,
and I have made it in print so

00:17:36.147 --> 00:17:39.882
Harold has seen it,
that Bloom misreads and is a

00:17:39.882 --> 00:17:42.188
strong misreader of
T.S. Eliot:

00:17:42.188 --> 00:17:46.799
which is to say--such is the
logic of strong misreading--that

00:17:46.799 --> 00:17:51.490
T.S. Eliot said everything
Bloom has to say already.

00:17:51.490 --> 00:17:53.019
I do believe this,
&gt;

00:17:53.019 --> 00:17:56.570
despite this extraordinary
appearance of total difference

00:17:56.570 --> 00:17:59.171
in perspective,
the traditional versus the

00:17:59.171 --> 00:18:00.630
Romantic and so on.
 

00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:04.451
I don't want to go into detail
in this argument for fear of

00:18:04.451 --> 00:18:09.090
being considered obsessive,
but I'd like to make a few

00:18:09.090 --> 00:18:13.503
points about it in passing,
because I think it's such a

00:18:13.503 --> 00:18:16.554
perfect exemplification of how
The Anxiety of Influence

00:18:16.554 --> 00:18:17.250
works.
 

00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:21.006
Bloom has always denied the
influence of "Tradition in

00:18:21.006 --> 00:18:22.950
the Individual Talent."
 

00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:27.047
He acknowledges influences,
but they are Emerson,

00:18:27.047 --> 00:18:31.230
Nietzsche, the great Romantic
poets, and so on.

00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:34.500
He has, as I say,
vehemently denied the influence

00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:36.856
of Eliot,
yet as one reads Eliot--and I'm

00:18:36.856 --> 00:18:38.940
going to spend some time with
Eliot now--

00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:41.818
it seems to me that at least in
skeletal form,

00:18:41.818 --> 00:18:46.420
in suggestion,
Bloom is all there already,

00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:49.615
which is, after all,
all Bloom ever says about the

00:18:49.615 --> 00:18:53.070
relationship between a precursor
and a belated writer:

00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:55.549
so it can't be surprising,
can it?

00:18:55.549 --> 00:18:56.200
All right.
 

00:18:56.200 --> 00:19:01.875
Now first of all,
it's very important to Bloom to

00:19:01.875 --> 00:19:07.904
show the way in which the new
reconstitutes the old:

00:19:07.904 --> 00:19:12.517
that is to say,
the appropriation of the

00:19:12.517 --> 00:19:16.242
precursor text,
which is not a notional text

00:19:16.242 --> 00:19:18.998
although it--
and that's one of the things

00:19:18.998 --> 00:19:22.615
that's sort of counterintuitive
about Bloom's writing in this

00:19:22.615 --> 00:19:23.220
period.
 

00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:26.640
He insists that there is a
particular precursor text.

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:29.099
The precursor text for
"Tintern Abbey"

00:19:29.099 --> 00:19:30.410
is "Lycidas."
 

00:19:30.410 --> 00:19:31.710
Don't tell me about other
&gt;

00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:32.910
precursor texts.
 

00:19:32.910 --> 00:19:36.723
It's "Lycidas,"
and he shows how this is the

00:19:36.723 --> 00:19:39.659
case,
but the relationship between

00:19:39.659 --> 00:19:44.210
the belated text and the
precursor text is such that we

00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:48.930
can never read the precursor
text the same way again.

00:19:48.930 --> 00:19:53.711
The strong misreading of the
precursor text is so powerful,

00:19:53.711 --> 00:19:57.093
in other words,
that it becomes our strong

00:19:57.093 --> 00:19:58.328
misreading.
 

00:19:58.328 --> 00:20:00.757
We just can't think about
"Lycidas"

00:20:00.757 --> 00:20:03.957
in the same way on this view
after we've read "Tintern

00:20:03.957 --> 00:20:04.838
Abbey."
 

00:20:04.838 --> 00:20:09.917
If this seems counterintuitive,
just think about certain

00:20:09.917 --> 00:20:13.150
examples that might come to
mind.

00:20:13.150 --> 00:20:18.000
The most obvious example is the
famous text by Borges called

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.961
"Pierre Menard,
Author of Don

00:20:20.961 --> 00:20:22.769
Quixote."
 

00:20:22.769 --> 00:20:25.098
I imagine a number of you know
that text,

00:20:25.098 --> 00:20:29.240
but what it consists in
basically is--

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:34.118
it's a kind of an anecdote
about a Frenchman writing,

00:20:34.118 --> 00:20:38.310
as I recall,
in the end of the nineteenth

00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:43.895
century in Spanish a text,
and his text is as it turns out

00:20:43.895 --> 00:20:46.186
verbatim,
word for word,

00:20:46.186 --> 00:20:51.423
Cervantes' Don Quixote,
only it's not Cervantes' Don

00:20:51.423 --> 00:20:53.680
Quixote;
it's Pierre Menard's Don

00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:54.349
Quixote.
 

00:20:54.349 --> 00:20:56.038
Think how different it is.
 

00:20:56.038 --> 00:20:59.288
This is a Frenchman at the end
of the nineteenth century

00:20:59.288 --> 00:21:00.528
writing in Spanish.
 

00:21:00.528 --> 00:21:03.382
That's pretty impressive,
much more impressive than

00:21:03.382 --> 00:21:06.118
Cervantes merely writing in his
own language,

00:21:06.118 --> 00:21:10.180
and it's a completely different
historical perspective.

00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:13.624
Whereas Cervantes thinks he's
being a little bit ironic about

00:21:13.624 --> 00:21:16.875
his own historical moment--
the death of chivalry and all

00:21:16.875 --> 00:21:19.199
that--
think about how ironic you can

00:21:19.199 --> 00:21:23.207
be about that historical moment
writing several centuries later

00:21:23.207 --> 00:21:25.598
with everything that you know
now.

00:21:25.598 --> 00:21:29.855
What a tour de force to be able
to write Don Quixote at

00:21:29.855 --> 00:21:33.555
the end of the nineteenth
century in another language,

00:21:33.555 --> 00:21:35.368
a whole new ball game!
 

00:21:35.368 --> 00:21:39.851
How can you ever read
Cervantes' Don Quixote in

00:21:39.851 --> 00:21:41.119
the same way?
 

00:21:41.119 --> 00:21:43.019
It seems naïve, right?
 

00:21:43.019 --> 00:21:45.970
Now that's not the point of the
story.

00:21:45.970 --> 00:21:49.721
The point of the story is
actually to belittle Pierre

00:21:49.721 --> 00:21:54.338
Menard, but you can see this as
a theory of strong misreading.

00:21:54.338 --> 00:21:57.667
Pierre Menard thinks he's doing
something new,

00:21:57.667 --> 00:21:58.259
right?
 

00:21:58.259 --> 00:22:01.305
The fact is,
he's not doing anything new at

00:22:01.305 --> 00:22:01.740
all.
 

00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:05.209
His belief that he's doing
something new is precisely his

00:22:05.209 --> 00:22:07.440
misreading of the precursor
text--

00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:16.086
and by the way,
you don't have to have read the

00:22:16.086 --> 00:22:21.121
precursor text--
but that misreading,

00:22:21.121 --> 00:22:25.250
after all, is something in its
very power which,

00:22:25.250 --> 00:22:29.616
as it were, infiltrates our own
understanding of the precursor

00:22:29.616 --> 00:22:31.746
text,
making it impossible for us to

00:22:31.746 --> 00:22:33.200
read it the same way again.
 

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:34.598
Think of Joyce's Ulysses.
 

00:22:34.598 --> 00:22:36.345
We all know that
Ulysses,

00:22:36.345 --> 00:22:39.609
like Virgil's Aeneid,
is based on The Odyssey

00:22:39.609 --> 00:22:42.818
and that it, as it were,
recycles The Odyssey;

00:22:42.818 --> 00:22:45.446
but it seems to be looking at
The Odyssey through the

00:22:45.446 --> 00:22:46.650
wrong end of a telescope.
 

00:22:46.650 --> 00:22:51.957
It's dragging all the sort of
heroic dimension of the poem

00:22:51.957 --> 00:22:57.450
down into a kind of nitty-gritty
account of everyday life in

00:22:57.450 --> 00:22:59.220
recent society.
 

00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:01.319
In other words,
it implicitly,

00:23:01.319 --> 00:23:05.594
precisely in following The
Odyssey debunks the heroic

00:23:05.594 --> 00:23:07.838
myth of The Odyssey.
 

00:23:07.838 --> 00:23:10.048
How can we read,
in other words,

00:23:10.048 --> 00:23:14.036
The Odyssey in the same
way again after we've read

00:23:14.036 --> 00:23:15.390
Ulysses?
 

00:23:15.390 --> 00:23:17.440
Now it has to be said,
and Bloom would say this,

00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:20.534
Ulysses is not a strong
misreading of The Odyssey

00:23:20.534 --> 00:23:23.230
because it's perfectly conscious
of what it's doing.

00:23:23.230 --> 00:23:27.250
It knows exactly what it's
doing with respect to the text

00:23:27.250 --> 00:23:31.558
of The Odyssey, so
it's a deliberate misreading

00:23:31.558 --> 00:23:33.568
which has other virtues.
 

00:23:33.568 --> 00:23:38.429
It's not quite the same thing,
but what it does have in common

00:23:38.429 --> 00:23:43.366
with Bloom's theory and what it
has in common also with Eliot's

00:23:43.366 --> 00:23:47.827
idea about the relationship
between the individual talent

00:23:47.827 --> 00:23:52.210
and tradition is that it
reconstitutes tradition.

00:23:52.210 --> 00:23:55.338
It doesn't just provide
something novel.

00:23:55.338 --> 00:24:00.288
It makes us see tradition
itself in a different way.

00:24:00.288 --> 00:24:03.788
Turn to page 538,
the right-hand column about

00:24:03.788 --> 00:24:07.259
halfway down:
The existing monuments [says

00:24:07.259 --> 00:24:09.695
Eliot]
form an ideal order among

00:24:09.695 --> 00:24:14.645
themselves which is modified by
the introduction of the new (the

00:24:14.645 --> 00:24:17.788
really new) work of art among
them.

00:24:17.788 --> 00:24:22.460
The existing order is complete
before the new work arrives;

00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:26.924
for order to persist after the
supervention of novelty,

00:24:26.924 --> 00:24:31.307
the whole existing order must
be, if ever so slightly,

00:24:31.307 --> 00:24:32.298
altered.
 

00:24:32.298 --> 00:24:36.440
We can't quite see it the same
way again,

00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:39.964
so it's a dynamic,
mutual relationship between

00:24:39.964 --> 00:24:44.665
tradition and the individual
talent: the strong precursor and

00:24:44.665 --> 00:24:47.538
the belated poet,
in each case,

00:24:47.538 --> 00:24:50.368
which is mutually transforming.
 

00:24:50.368 --> 00:24:54.480
The basis, the principle of
transformation,

00:24:54.480 --> 00:25:00.205
is the belated poet's strong
misreading of the precursor

00:25:00.205 --> 00:25:06.868
which simultaneously asserts the
egoistic priority of the belated

00:25:06.868 --> 00:25:12.311
poet: I'm doing something new;
I'm going where no one has ever

00:25:12.311 --> 00:25:13.108
gone before.
 

00:25:13.108 --> 00:25:16.875
I'm doing so so powerfully that
it's a question of whether there

00:25:16.875 --> 00:25:20.178
actually was anybody before,
on the one hand,

00:25:20.178 --> 00:25:23.890
and the strong precursor who
turns out,

00:25:23.890 --> 00:25:27.618
as one reflects more and more
and more about the relationship,

00:25:27.618 --> 00:25:30.565
to have said everything the
belated poet says already,

00:25:30.565 --> 00:25:31.009
right?
 

00:25:31.009 --> 00:25:36.416
So simultaneously,
Bloom's theory of literary

00:25:36.416 --> 00:25:40.286
history,
his literary historiography,

00:25:40.286 --> 00:25:45.049
places a premium on innovation
and on conservatism,

00:25:45.049 --> 00:25:47.460
or tradition, simultaneously.
 

00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:51.282
Unlike Gadamer,
leaning toward the conservative

00:25:51.282 --> 00:25:54.460
or traditional,
and Iser or the Russian

00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:57.934
formalists,
who lean toward the innovative,

00:25:57.934 --> 00:26:01.845
the Bloomian idea
simultaneously countenances the

00:26:01.845 --> 00:26:06.732
idea of tradition as something
absolutely continuous and also

00:26:06.732 --> 00:26:11.865
of tradition as something which
is constantly being remade or at

00:26:11.865 --> 00:26:13.740
least rethought.
 

00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:17.871
That, I have to tell you,
is very similar to

00:26:17.871 --> 00:26:20.368
T.S. Eliot's position.
 

00:26:20.368 --> 00:26:26.000
So now again the famous
aphorism of Eliot on page 539,

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:30.038
the left-hand column at the
bottom:

00:26:30.038 --> 00:26:32.594
Someone said:
"The dead writers are

00:26:32.594 --> 00:26:36.588
remote from us because we know
so much than they did."

00:26:36.588 --> 00:26:40.269
Precisely, and they are that
which we know.

00:26:40.269 --> 00:26:41.390
Rather good, I think.
 

00:26:41.390 --> 00:26:45.356
The famous aphorism of
T.S. Eliot can also be

00:26:45.356 --> 00:26:49.865
understood as something that
Bloom, in his own way,

00:26:49.865 --> 00:26:52.210
might very well say.
 

00:26:52.210 --> 00:26:56.362
The past is what we know,
but we're not aware of knowing

00:26:56.362 --> 00:26:56.740
it.
 

00:26:56.740 --> 00:26:59.809
In other words,
I write the past when I write

00:26:59.809 --> 00:27:03.298
my belated poem,
but I don't think I'm doing it.

00:27:03.298 --> 00:27:07.220
I think instead that I'm doing
something new.

00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:11.017
In the first provisionary
ratio, clinamen,

00:27:11.017 --> 00:27:15.648
I am swerving from the past:
I swerve out and down,

00:27:15.648 --> 00:27:19.910
I find my own space like a
Lucretian atom.

00:27:19.910 --> 00:27:22.671
If it weren't for swerving--and
Lucretius says all the atoms

00:27:22.671 --> 00:27:25.490
would fall in the same place--
that wouldn't be good,

00:27:25.490 --> 00:27:29.088
so they all swerve so they can
all fall in their own place.

00:27:29.088 --> 00:27:33.337
Well, that is the belated
poet's sense of what he's doing

00:27:33.337 --> 00:27:35.690
in relation to the precursor.
 

00:27:35.690 --> 00:27:39.586
He's swerving out and down from
the precursor poet,

00:27:39.586 --> 00:27:41.381
but of course he's not.
 

00:27:41.381 --> 00:27:43.328
&gt;
 

00:27:43.328 --> 00:27:46.170
Again--and we'll come back to
this--he's not.

00:27:46.170 --> 00:27:48.160
He's actually falling in the
same place,

00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:52.076
but the strength of that
swerve, the rhetorical gesture

00:27:52.076 --> 00:27:56.093
of the swerve,
is so powerful that we do feel

00:27:56.093 --> 00:27:57.298
transported.
 

00:27:57.298 --> 00:28:02.950
Once again we feel both at
once, the innovation and the

00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:07.971
necessary conservatism,
or preservational aspect,

00:28:07.971 --> 00:28:11.529
of the new poet's composition.
 

00:28:11.529 --> 00:28:12.250
All right.
 

00:28:12.250 --> 00:28:16.997
So I think, as I say,
that Eliot's aphorism,

00:28:16.997 --> 00:28:23.068
too, very much anticipates
Bloom's view of the agonistic

00:28:23.068 --> 00:28:25.828
struggle among poets.
 

00:28:25.828 --> 00:28:29.490
Then finally Eliot's famous
emphasis--

00:28:29.490 --> 00:28:32.220
and of course,
nothing could seem to be less

00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:35.481
gloomy than this--
Eliot's famous emphasis on the

00:28:35.481 --> 00:28:39.625
poet's impersonality,
on the wish to escape

00:28:39.625 --> 00:28:44.176
personality: he says,
in the right-hand column,

00:28:44.176 --> 00:28:46.779
page 541,
end of section two, "But,

00:28:46.779 --> 00:28:51.150
of course, only those who have
personality and emotions know

00:28:51.150 --> 00:28:55.519
what it means to want to escape
from these things"--

00:28:55.519 --> 00:28:57.838
in other words,
to enter a world of art,

00:28:57.838 --> 00:29:03.599
in effect, to abandon the sense
that what's important is my

00:29:03.599 --> 00:29:09.854
personal psychological agony;
to enter, by contrast,

00:29:09.854 --> 00:29:14.605
the mind of Europe;
to recognize the complete

00:29:14.605 --> 00:29:18.858
insignificance of any individual
mind, certainly my own;

00:29:18.858 --> 00:29:23.480
and to immerse oneself as a
poet, as an artist,

00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:27.384
and as a creator,
if one can still retain this

00:29:27.384 --> 00:29:30.663
term,
in that which is infinitely

00:29:30.663 --> 00:29:33.630
more vast than one is oneself.
 

00:29:33.630 --> 00:29:40.565
Well, that doesn't sound very
Bloomian, but look on page 1160,

00:29:40.565 --> 00:29:46.249
the right-hand column,
at Bloom's fifth revisionary

00:29:46.249 --> 00:29:48.410
ratio, askesis.
 

00:29:48.410 --> 00:30:02.990
&gt;
 

00:30:02.990 --> 00:30:08.807
He's talking about what the
later poet, the belated poet,

00:30:08.807 --> 00:30:13.170
does in order to find space for
himself.

00:30:13.170 --> 00:30:16.555
What can I do in order to make
myself different from other

00:30:16.555 --> 00:30:17.088
people?
 

00:30:17.088 --> 00:30:20.580
Well, you'd think the answer
would be make yourself bigger

00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:21.500
than anybody.
 

00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:25.327
Wallace Stevens has a wonderful
poem called "Rabbit as King

00:30:25.327 --> 00:30:28.182
of the Ghosts,"
and the rabbit swells up to

00:30:28.182 --> 00:30:31.890
become so big that it just kind
of overwhelms everything.

00:30:31.890 --> 00:30:34.440
I always think of this as
Bloom's belated poet,

00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:40.316
but if you have askesis as one
of the authentic revisionary

00:30:40.316 --> 00:30:43.303
ratios,
something very different is

00:30:43.303 --> 00:30:45.348
happening to this same end.
 

00:30:45.348 --> 00:30:49.865
About halfway through the
definition, definition five--and

00:30:49.865 --> 00:30:54.382
by the way, the masculine
pronoun is something that Harold

00:30:54.382 --> 00:30:56.680
has never apologized for.
 

00:30:56.680 --> 00:31:00.808
What he means is that a poet is
gendered masculine but that,

00:31:00.808 --> 00:31:03.400
of course, any woman can be a
poet.

00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:06.900
We'll come back to distinctions
of that sort later.

00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:09.297
He does think of Emily
Dickinson, for example,

00:31:09.297 --> 00:31:10.308
as a strong poet.
 

00:31:10.308 --> 00:31:14.182
Obviously, that's a
controversial aspect of Bloom's

00:31:14.182 --> 00:31:18.828
work, but he uses the masculine
prologue unapologetically.

00:31:18.828 --> 00:31:22.233
Of course, his theory is very
much caught up in the idea of

00:31:22.233 --> 00:31:24.971
Oedipal conflict which,
as Freud is always being

00:31:24.971 --> 00:31:28.664
criticized for,
is, unless you project it into

00:31:28.664 --> 00:31:34.619
the realm of the symbolic as
Lacan and feminist Lacanians do,

00:31:34.619 --> 00:31:38.000
undoubtedly a masculist idea.
 

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:41.270
If the essential generational
conflict of human beings is

00:31:41.270 --> 00:31:43.490
between father and son,
well, obviously

00:31:43.490 --> 00:31:45.009
&gt;
 

00:31:45.009 --> 00:31:50.154
problems can be seen to arise
from that, and in Bloom's

00:31:50.154 --> 00:31:55.679
rhetoric, in his vocabulary,
the masculist Oedipal conflict

00:31:55.679 --> 00:31:57.680
is still central.
 

00:31:57.680 --> 00:32:01.213
In any case,
returning to this point about

00:32:01.213 --> 00:32:06.137
the effacement of the self,
in the very act of trying to

00:32:06.137 --> 00:32:09.730
find a place for oneself as an
innovator--

00:32:09.730 --> 00:32:13.993
an effacement which,
however, once again seems to me

00:32:13.993 --> 00:32:18.926
to catapult Bloom back into the
position of Eliot that he is

00:32:18.926 --> 00:32:21.519
trying to misread strongly.
 

00:32:21.519 --> 00:32:25.855
He says, "[The poet]
yields up part of his own human

00:32:25.855 --> 00:32:28.490
and imaginative endowment."
 

00:32:28.490 --> 00:32:30.640
In other words,
he curtails himself;

00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:34.164
he shrinks himself;
he makes himself less than he

00:32:34.164 --> 00:32:37.568
might have been,
of course, in order to be more

00:32:37.568 --> 00:32:39.048
than he has been.
 

00:32:39.048 --> 00:32:43.486
He yields up part of his own
human and imaginative endowment

00:32:43.486 --> 00:32:48.298
so as to separate himself from
others including the precursor.

00:32:48.298 --> 00:32:52.420
So in askesis--and also in
kenosis,

00:32:52.420 --> 00:32:55.286
by the way--there is a
self-shrinking or

00:32:55.286 --> 00:32:59.842
self-effacement on the part of
these particular moves of strong

00:32:59.842 --> 00:33:03.150
misreading with respect to the
precursor.

00:33:03.150 --> 00:33:06.528
It's not, in other words,
just a question of the rabbit

00:33:06.528 --> 00:33:08.028
as king of the ghosts.
 

00:33:08.028 --> 00:33:11.757
It's not a question of a
massive ego swelling to the

00:33:11.757 --> 00:33:14.170
point where it fills all space.
 

00:33:14.170 --> 00:33:17.934
It is more complicated than
that, and in being more

00:33:17.934 --> 00:33:21.250
complicated it is frankly more
Eliot-like.

00:33:21.250 --> 00:33:22.192
All right.
 

00:33:22.192 --> 00:33:27.854
So turning then more directly
to Bloom, his career begins--it

00:33:27.854 --> 00:33:33.326
has always involved a sense of
struggle in the relationship

00:33:33.326 --> 00:33:34.930
among poets.
 

00:33:34.930 --> 00:33:37.602
In his earliest
work--Shelley's

00:33:37.602 --> 00:33:41.103
Mythmaking,
Blake's Apocalypse,

00:33:41.103 --> 00:33:45.570
and The Visionary Company--
the idea of struggle was

00:33:45.570 --> 00:33:49.200
embodied plainly as what he
called Protestantism.

00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:52.131
In other words,
he saw the tradition he was

00:33:52.131 --> 00:33:56.038
talking about arising in
relation to the Reformation,

00:33:56.038 --> 00:33:58.845
that time when,
as I said in my thumbnail

00:33:58.845 --> 00:34:02.589
history of hermeneutics,
everybody suddenly realized he

00:34:02.589 --> 00:34:05.737
had his own Bible and his own
relationship with God:

00:34:05.737 --> 00:34:09.286
in other words,
that time when human

00:34:09.286 --> 00:34:12.922
individuality emerges,
which is also,

00:34:12.922 --> 00:34:15.831
of course, called by many
others the emergence of the

00:34:15.831 --> 00:34:16.670
bourgeoisie.
 

00:34:16.670 --> 00:34:20.210
In that moment,
the idea of Protestantism--

00:34:20.210 --> 00:34:23.070
purely in the sense,
as a character in Durrell says,

00:34:23.070 --> 00:34:27.358
"that I protest"--
emerges so that each poet

00:34:27.358 --> 00:34:31.804
takes, in some sense,
an adversary stance toward

00:34:31.804 --> 00:34:33.880
previous literary models.
 

00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:36.541
This is present in Bloom's work
from the beginning of his

00:34:36.541 --> 00:34:36.969
career.
 

00:34:36.969 --> 00:34:41.090
The word "Protestant"
gradually gives way to the word

00:34:41.090 --> 00:34:44.614
"revisionary,"
and then that's the word that

00:34:44.614 --> 00:34:48.070
he uses primarily in The
Visionary Company,

00:34:48.070 --> 00:34:52.260
for example,
and then finally becomes the

00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:54.349
notion of misreading.
 

00:34:54.349 --> 00:34:59.079
The protest of the belated
figure is the protest which

00:34:59.079 --> 00:35:04.702
takes the form of transfiguring
the precursor text in such a way

00:35:04.702 --> 00:35:08.719
that one can find oneself to be
original.

00:35:08.719 --> 00:35:10.630
It is an Oedipal struggle.
 

00:35:10.630 --> 00:35:14.146
Now this idea of Oedipal
struggle, which is largely

00:35:14.146 --> 00:35:18.014
unconscious, is not new to
Bloom, just quickly to review

00:35:18.014 --> 00:35:20.969
the next three passages on your
sheet.

00:35:20.969 --> 00:35:26.646
Longinus, the author whose
actual identity we cannot quite

00:35:26.646 --> 00:35:31.130
determine but whose On the
Sublime,

00:35:31.130 --> 00:35:33.409
an extraordinarily interesting
text,

00:35:33.409 --> 00:35:37.253
is available to us to
read--I've got two passages from

00:35:37.253 --> 00:35:37.690
him.
 

00:35:37.690 --> 00:35:41.275
The first is:
As if instinctively [this is in

00:35:41.275 --> 00:35:45.918
the moment of the sublime]
our soul is uplifted by the

00:35:45.918 --> 00:35:47.320
true sublime.
 

00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:47.737
[Fine.
 

00:35:47.737 --> 00:35:50.797
That's what you would expect
anybody to say.]

00:35:50.797 --> 00:35:54.831
It takes a proud flight and is
filled with joy and vaunting

00:35:54.831 --> 00:35:57.405
[and this is where the surprise
comes]

00:35:57.405 --> 00:36:01.440
as though it had itself
produced what it has heard.

00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:05.579
In other words,
there's a kind of possession by

00:36:05.579 --> 00:36:11.070
the other that takes place which
is simultaneously experienced

00:36:11.070 --> 00:36:15.929
psychologically as possession of
the other, right?

00:36:15.929 --> 00:36:18.130
It is speaking through me.
 

00:36:18.130 --> 00:36:21.050
It's making me very excited
like a little kid.

00:36:21.050 --> 00:36:23.262
They're watching TV,
somebody hits a home run,

00:36:23.262 --> 00:36:25.376
and the little kid goes like
this [gestures]

00:36:25.376 --> 00:36:27.639
and thinks he thought he hit
the home run.

00:36:27.639 --> 00:36:31.407
He's completely into the
fantasy of being that hero,

00:36:31.407 --> 00:36:32.000
right?
 

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:37.115
It's the same thing with the
response to something that we

00:36:37.115 --> 00:36:40.885
haven't said,
such that in a certain moment

00:36:40.885 --> 00:36:43.489
we think we have said it.
 

00:36:43.489 --> 00:36:46.018
It's a mutual possession.
 

00:36:46.018 --> 00:36:49.273
It possesses us,
causing the psychological

00:36:49.273 --> 00:36:53.639
reaction that we think of
ourselves as possessing it.

00:36:53.639 --> 00:36:58.157
It seems to me that there is
real insight in what Longinus is

00:36:58.157 --> 00:37:02.300
saying and that it has an
important influence on Bloom's

00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:03.280
position.
 

00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:07.849
Another passage from
Longinus--and by the way,

00:37:07.849 --> 00:37:10.815
I think what Longinus says here
is absolutely true:

00:37:10.815 --> 00:37:13.010
Plato is constantly abusing
Homer,

00:37:13.010 --> 00:37:19.039
and yet nothing can be easier
than to show the ways in which

00:37:19.039 --> 00:37:25.172
the great Homeric actions and
even tropes help shape Platonic

00:37:25.172 --> 00:37:26.400
thought.
 

00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:29.510
It's a fascinating topic and
Longinus,

00:37:29.510 --> 00:37:32.811
it seems to me,
again is exactly right about

00:37:32.811 --> 00:37:36.880
it: "There would not have
been so fine a bloom of

00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:40.797
perfection on Plato's
philosophical doctrines unless

00:37:40.797 --> 00:37:45.250
he had with all his heart and
mind struggled with Homer for

00:37:45.250 --> 00:37:46.940
primacy."
 

00:37:46.940 --> 00:37:50.623
He even thinks in Bloomian
terms of that of wanting to be

00:37:50.623 --> 00:37:54.440
first even though in some part
of your mind you know you're

00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:57.139
second--
he even struggles for primacy,

00:37:57.139 --> 00:38:00.769
showing perhaps too much love
of contention and breaking a

00:38:00.769 --> 00:38:03.965
lance with him,
as it were, but deriving some

00:38:03.965 --> 00:38:06.500
profit from the contest
nonetheless;

00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:10.077
for as he says,
"This strife is good for

00:38:10.077 --> 00:38:11.380
mortals."
 

00:38:11.380 --> 00:38:14.777
Quickly, a more commonplace
example taking from

00:38:14.777 --> 00:38:17.451
Sainte-Beuve,
a famous essay of his called

00:38:17.451 --> 00:38:20.739
"What is a Classic?"--
which is all about influence.

00:38:20.739 --> 00:38:24.827
There's a tradition of essays
called "What is a

00:38:24.827 --> 00:38:26.110
Classic?"
 

00:38:26.110 --> 00:38:29.755
Eliot wrote a great one in
1944, and these are very much a

00:38:29.755 --> 00:38:33.400
contribution to the history of
the theory of influence.

00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:36.887
So Sainte-Beuve writes:
Goethe spoke the truth when he

00:38:36.887 --> 00:38:40.284
remarked that Byron,
great by the flow and source of

00:38:40.284 --> 00:38:42.543
poetry,
feared that Shakespeare was

00:38:42.543 --> 00:38:44.980
more powerful than himself [it's
true,

00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:48.494
Byron was always abusing
Shakespeare]

00:38:48.494 --> 00:38:53.570
in the creation and realization
of his characters.

00:38:53.570 --> 00:38:55.590
He would have liked to deny it.
 

00:38:55.590 --> 00:39:00.465
The elevation so free from
[this is Goethe talking]

00:39:00.465 --> 00:39:02.710
egoism irritated him.
 

00:39:02.710 --> 00:39:07.054
He felt when near it that he
could never display himself at

00:39:07.054 --> 00:39:07.579
ease.
 

00:39:07.579 --> 00:39:12.039
He never denied Pope because he
did not fear him.

00:39:12.039 --> 00:39:17.710
He knew that Pope was [and you
know how short Pope was]

00:39:17.710 --> 00:39:20.860
only a low wall by his side.
 

00:39:20.860 --> 00:39:23.960
So in other words,
he chose as his literary model

00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:26.480
somebody he knew he was better
than--

00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:29.331
not true, by the way,
but he thought he was better

00:39:29.331 --> 00:39:32.599
than Alexander Pope,
and he perpetually denied a

00:39:32.599 --> 00:39:35.960
very, very powerful influence on
his writing,

00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:40.141
quarreling constantly with
Shakespeare and bardolatry and

00:39:40.141 --> 00:39:44.400
excessive love of Hamlet
and all the rest of it.

00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:49.534
He's constantly sort of denying
any influence or power over

00:39:49.534 --> 00:39:52.809
himself on the part of
Shakespeare.

00:39:52.809 --> 00:39:57.164
He chooses, in other words,
for his precursor a weak

00:39:57.164 --> 00:40:00.750
precursor instead of a strong
precursor.

00:40:00.750 --> 00:40:06.878
All of this is a continuous
theme in the psychodynamic of

00:40:06.878 --> 00:40:10.929
Bloom's theory as he elaborates
it.

00:40:10.929 --> 00:40:13.670
So what complicates Bloom's
argument,

00:40:13.670 --> 00:40:17.510
apart from the vocabulary and
the philosophical range of

00:40:17.510 --> 00:40:20.407
thought,
is what I began with:

00:40:20.407 --> 00:40:25.373
the traditional idea of
influence as an art-nature

00:40:25.373 --> 00:40:28.411
problem,
trying to figure out,

00:40:28.411 --> 00:40:33.704
in fact, whether the crisis of
influence is the sense of one's

00:40:33.704 --> 00:40:37.960
orientation to nature,
one's ability to imitate nature

00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:40.219
and have nature available to
one,

00:40:40.219 --> 00:40:45.385
or whether it's word oriented,
which it seems to be more in

00:40:45.385 --> 00:40:49.929
Bloom: the sense of one's
relationship with text.

00:40:49.929 --> 00:40:55.742
But notice on page 1157 that
Bloom really doesn't want to say

00:40:55.742 --> 00:40:57.969
it's just about text.
 

00:40:57.969 --> 00:41:01.949
He doesn't really want to say
that it has exclusively to do

00:41:01.949 --> 00:41:05.242
with the strong precursor
understood, as it were,

00:41:05.242 --> 00:41:06.409
as an author.
 

00:41:06.409 --> 00:41:11.119
There is in some sense a text
of nature as well,

00:41:11.119 --> 00:41:14.525
so that Bloom says,
bottom of 1157,

00:41:14.525 --> 00:41:17.929
right-hand column:
… Freud's disciple,

00:41:17.929 --> 00:41:21.259
Otto Rank, show[s]
a greater awareness of the

00:41:21.259 --> 00:41:25.597
artist's fight against art,
and of the relation of this

00:41:25.597 --> 00:41:29.503
struggle to the artist's
antithetical battle against

00:41:29.503 --> 00:41:30.269
nature.
 

00:41:30.269 --> 00:41:34.219
In other words, nature is death.
 

00:41:34.219 --> 00:41:40.057
Nature is that into
which--should he not sustain

00:41:40.057 --> 00:41:47.760
himself in the triumph of his
assertion of priority nature--

00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:52.920
the author will fall back in
the form of death.

00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:55.500
Wait until they try to
transcribe that sentence.

00:41:55.500 --> 00:41:55.900
Okay.
 

00:41:55.900 --> 00:41:58.360
Well, but you
&gt;

00:41:58.360 --> 00:42:02.070
got what I mean.
 

00:42:02.070 --> 00:42:06.458
This is an interesting problem,
and Bloom wants to insist that

00:42:06.458 --> 00:42:10.557
part of the struggle of the
belated poet is a struggle for

00:42:10.557 --> 00:42:11.710
immortality.
 

00:42:11.710 --> 00:42:16.820
Part of what it means to come
first and to know nothing ever

00:42:16.820 --> 00:42:21.932
having been there before you is
also to suppose that you are

00:42:21.932 --> 00:42:25.603
going to be last,
that you're going to be

00:42:25.603 --> 00:42:30.050
immortal, that you really do not
belong in an unfolding,

00:42:30.050 --> 00:42:34.190
inexorable sequence of the sort
that we call history;

00:42:34.190 --> 00:42:37.577
but that you are rather
something, a force,

00:42:37.577 --> 00:42:41.369
a genius, or a power that
transcends history.

00:42:41.369 --> 00:42:46.003
This entails as much the
"lie against time,"

00:42:46.003 --> 00:42:50.797
as Bloom calls it,
holding off death as it does,

00:42:50.797 --> 00:42:55.489
insisting on there having been
no beginning,

00:42:55.489 --> 00:42:59.610
no priority,
and no genesis in what you do;

00:42:59.610 --> 00:43:01.920
you were there first.
 

00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:02.677
All right.
 

00:43:02.677 --> 00:43:06.766
To illustrate this very
quickly, let's look at passages

00:43:06.766 --> 00:43:09.039
five and six on your sheet.
 

00:43:09.039 --> 00:43:17.344
Wordsworth, the particularly
important strong misreader and

00:43:17.344 --> 00:43:22.929
belated poet with respect to
Milton,

00:43:22.929 --> 00:43:27.302
in Bloom's view:
Wordsworth writes in a kind of

00:43:27.302 --> 00:43:30.630
programmatic or promissory
poem--

00:43:30.630 --> 00:43:35.358
written actually in 1800 and
not published until 1814 as part

00:43:35.358 --> 00:43:39.063
of the preface to a poem of his
called "The

00:43:39.063 --> 00:43:42.210
Excursion"--
he wrote a prospectus to

00:43:42.210 --> 00:43:45.128
"The Recluse,"
that's what at one time

00:43:45.128 --> 00:43:48.670
"The Excursion"
was supposed to be part of,

00:43:48.670 --> 00:43:51.635
and he says:
"I am not interested in

00:43:51.635 --> 00:43:55.592
writing Paradise Lost.
Paradise Lost for me is

00:43:55.592 --> 00:43:56.699
a thing of the past.
 

00:43:56.699 --> 00:43:58.829
It's just archaic.
 

00:43:58.829 --> 00:44:02.112
Who would care about the things
Milton cares about:

00:44:02.112 --> 00:44:05.686
'all strength,
all terror, single or in bands

00:44:05.686 --> 00:44:09.210
that ever was put forth in
personal form,

00:44:09.210 --> 00:44:12.938
Jehovah with his thunder and
the choir of shouting angels and

00:44:12.938 --> 00:44:17.340
the imperial thrones,
I pass them unalarmed.'

00:44:17.340 --> 00:44:20.264
Paradise Lost,
that's just playing with

00:44:20.264 --> 00:44:21.239
toy soldiers.
 

00:44:21.239 --> 00:44:27.670
That's nothing compared with
what I myself am going to do:

00:44:27.670 --> 00:44:31.769
'not chaos,
not the darkest pit of lowest

00:44:31.769 --> 00:44:36.724
Erebus nor aught of blinder
vacancy scooped out by help of

00:44:36.724 --> 00:44:41.938
dreams can breed such fear and
awe as fall upon us often when

00:44:41.938 --> 00:44:46.822
we look into our minds,
into the mind of man,

00:44:46.822 --> 00:44:51.550
my haunt and the main region of
my song.'

00:44:51.550 --> 00:44:52.940
I'm not talking about God.
 

00:44:52.940 --> 00:44:54.559
I'm not talking about heaven.
 

00:44:54.559 --> 00:44:56.710
I'm not talking about hell.
 

00:44:56.710 --> 00:44:59.039
I'm not talking about war in
heaven.

00:44:59.039 --> 00:45:03.271
I'm not talking about anything
mythological or archaically

00:45:03.271 --> 00:45:03.940
heroic.
 

00:45:03.940 --> 00:45:06.760
"I'm talking about this.
 

00:45:06.760 --> 00:45:08.659
I'm talking about the mind of
man.

00:45:08.659 --> 00:45:12.780
I'm talking primarily about my
mind, but my mind is your mind.

00:45:12.780 --> 00:45:16.443
Mind is universal,
and in talking about mind I'm

00:45:16.443 --> 00:45:19.719
not falling back into the pit of
nature.

00:45:19.719 --> 00:45:24.539
I'm keeping my focus not on the
sky gods,

00:45:24.539 --> 00:45:27.871
not on the "transcendent,
starry junk,"

00:45:27.871 --> 00:45:31.364
as Wallace Stevens called it,
of my precursors,

00:45:31.364 --> 00:45:34.500
all those people with their
outworn superstitions.

00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:37.398
I'm not interested in any of
that, but I'm not interested in

00:45:37.398 --> 00:45:38.429
any of this either.
 

00:45:38.429 --> 00:45:39.719
I'm not interested in nature.
 

00:45:39.719 --> 00:45:43.445
I'm not interested in that in
which I would be buried if I

00:45:43.445 --> 00:45:45.079
reduced myself to that.
 

00:45:45.079 --> 00:45:47.476
I am interested in
consciousness,

00:45:47.476 --> 00:45:48.449
the psyche.
 

00:45:48.449 --> 00:45:51.025
In other words,
my focus is,"

00:45:51.025 --> 00:45:53.525
Wordsworth says,
"altogether

00:45:53.525 --> 00:45:55.400
psychological."
 

00:45:55.400 --> 00:45:58.289
All right.
 

00:45:58.289 --> 00:45:59.889
No interest in Paradise Lost.
 

00:45:59.889 --> 00:46:01.949
That's just archaic.
 

00:46:01.949 --> 00:46:06.092
Well, look at passage five:
three statements by Satan which

00:46:06.092 --> 00:46:10.376
Bloom insists--it's not so much
Milton, because Bloom follows

00:46:10.376 --> 00:46:12.518
Blake and Shelley in this.
 

00:46:12.518 --> 00:46:15.009
It's not so much Milton who is
the strong precursor of

00:46:15.009 --> 00:46:15.619
Wordsworth.
 

00:46:15.619 --> 00:46:16.820
It's actually Satan,
right?

00:46:16.820 --> 00:46:17.929
&gt;
 

00:46:17.929 --> 00:46:22.210
It's Milton's Satan who says,
"The mind is its own place

00:46:22.210 --> 00:46:26.920
and in itself can make a heaven
of hell, a hell of heaven."

00:46:26.920 --> 00:46:27.429
Okay.
 

00:46:27.429 --> 00:46:28.579
Gee whiz. &gt;
 

00:46:28.579 --> 00:46:31.449
I guess Satan is writing the
prospectus to "The

00:46:31.449 --> 00:46:32.969
Recluse,"
isn't he,

00:46:32.969 --> 00:46:35.760
because that's what Wordsworth
is saying in the prospectus to

00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:36.969
"The Recluse."
 

00:46:36.969 --> 00:46:40.463
"I know no time,"
says Satan, "when I was

00:46:40.463 --> 00:46:41.670
not as now."
 

00:46:41.670 --> 00:46:45.443
That's what the belated poet
always says, "I came

00:46:45.443 --> 00:46:46.440
first."
 

00:46:46.440 --> 00:46:48.599
Elsewhere in the poem Satan
tells his troops,

00:46:48.599 --> 00:46:49.679
"You know what.
 

00:46:49.679 --> 00:46:52.309
God keeps saying he created you.
 

00:46:52.309 --> 00:46:53.949
Do you remember being created?
 

00:46:53.949 --> 00:46:55.460
I don't remember being created.
 

00:46:55.460 --> 00:46:56.610
I've always been there."
 

00:46:56.610 --> 00:46:57.949
Right?
 

00:46:57.949 --> 00:47:00.721
That is, in effect,
what he says again,

00:47:00.721 --> 00:47:04.076
what he repeats in this
passage, "Finally,

00:47:04.076 --> 00:47:05.900
myself am hell."
 

00:47:05.900 --> 00:47:07.724
Well, that's,
of course, rather an

00:47:07.724 --> 00:47:10.820
uncomfortable thing to say,
but at the same time it's the

00:47:10.820 --> 00:47:13.199
rabbit as king of the ghosts,
isn't it?

00:47:13.199 --> 00:47:16.960
It is whatever you can throw at
me, I'm it already.

00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:18.768
Right?
 

00:47:18.768 --> 00:47:24.387
Because "the main haunt
and sole region of my song is

00:47:24.387 --> 00:47:27.639
the mind,"
is my own mind.

00:47:27.639 --> 00:47:28.920
All right.
 

00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:31.891
So Satan has already said in
Paradise Lost everything

00:47:31.891 --> 00:47:34.762
Wordsworth can possibly say in
the prospectus to "The

00:47:34.762 --> 00:47:35.670
Recluse."
 

00:47:35.670 --> 00:47:39.608
He has strongly misread
Paradise Lost such that

00:47:39.608 --> 00:47:43.250
he thinks he's doing something
completely new,

00:47:43.250 --> 00:47:48.934
while revealing precisely that
the strong precursor poet has

00:47:48.934 --> 00:47:54.619
always already written what the
successor poet can write.

00:47:54.619 --> 00:47:57.409
The tension,
the dynamic in other words,

00:47:57.409 --> 00:48:02.759
between conservation and
innovation is intact in all such

00:48:02.759 --> 00:48:05.545
moments,
in all the moments,

00:48:05.545 --> 00:48:09.110
that involve the anxiety of
influence.

00:48:09.110 --> 00:48:11.500
I'm sorry I have so little time
for this.

00:48:11.500 --> 00:48:16.001
Give me a minute or two because
we have to honor Tony the Tow

00:48:16.001 --> 00:48:20.289
Truck, and it's
rather obvious that for Lacan,

00:48:20.289 --> 00:48:24.074
Tony the Tow Truck is a
text in which Tony settles for

00:48:24.074 --> 00:48:27.963
the objet petit a,
right: little Bumpy the Car,

00:48:27.963 --> 00:48:31.909
an imperfect being but a
helpful one and a friend--

00:48:31.909 --> 00:48:33.340
"that's what I call a
friend";

00:48:33.340 --> 00:48:38.137
whereas the objects of desire,
Neato, Speedy--whoa,

00:48:38.137 --> 00:48:39.768
those are cars.
 

00:48:39.768 --> 00:48:44.210
The objects of desire are
improper object choices on the

00:48:44.210 --> 00:48:45.260
face of it.
 

00:48:45.260 --> 00:48:47.989
That's what an American ego
psychologist would say,

00:48:47.989 --> 00:48:50.643
but they are,
in a more Bunuelesque way of

00:48:50.643 --> 00:48:53.891
putting it,
obscure objects of desire as

00:48:53.891 --> 00:48:58.742
they motor on down the road
which are simply unavailable to

00:48:58.742 --> 00:49:01.670
Tony as object relations at all.
 

00:49:01.670 --> 00:49:06.579
So Neato and Speedy are the big
other--right?--and Bumpy is the

00:49:06.579 --> 00:49:08.480
object petit a.
 

00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:08.889
All right.
 

00:49:08.889 --> 00:49:12.362
Now it's just perfectly obvious
that for Harold Bloom,

00:49:12.362 --> 00:49:16.099
Tony the Tow Truck is a
strong misreading of The

00:49:16.099 --> 00:49:18.000
Little Engine that Could.
 

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:23.556
It's perfectly clear
because Bumpy is the hero of

00:49:23.556 --> 00:49:27.190
The Little Engine that Could.
 

00:49:27.190 --> 00:49:33.052
The misreading involves
making Tony the hero who needs

00:49:33.052 --> 00:49:35.110
the help of Bumpy.
 

00:49:35.110 --> 00:49:37.134
In other words,
Bumpy, in the folkloric sense

00:49:37.134 --> 00:49:39.182
of the story,
becomes the helper and not the

00:49:39.182 --> 00:49:40.820
hero,
but we can see,

00:49:40.820 --> 00:49:45.079
after all, that the essential
narrative model--

00:49:45.079 --> 00:49:51.077
the model of the small turning
out through perseverance and

00:49:51.077 --> 00:49:57.489
energy to necessarily reinforce
the strength of the strong--

00:49:57.489 --> 00:49:59.599
is about the strong and the
weak.

00:49:59.599 --> 00:50:02.643
Both The Little Engine that
Could and Tony the Tow

00:50:02.643 --> 00:50:05.070
Truck are about the strong
and the weak,

00:50:05.070 --> 00:50:10.224
that the strong must in some
sense or another be supplemented

00:50:10.224 --> 00:50:15.980
or supplanted by the weak if the
strong is fully to self-realize.

00:50:15.980 --> 00:50:19.309
We can't ever read Tony the
Tow Truck,

00:50:19.309 --> 00:50:22.972
the character,
Tony, quite the same way again

00:50:22.972 --> 00:50:27.695
after the appearance of Bumpy,
and yet Bumpy is nothing other

00:50:27.695 --> 00:50:31.739
than the hero of The Little
Engine that Could,

00:50:31.739 --> 00:50:37.764
a subject position that has
been appropriated by Tony in

00:50:37.764 --> 00:50:39.079
this text.
 

00:50:39.079 --> 00:50:43.599
So the relationship is again an
agonistic one involving the

00:50:43.599 --> 00:50:48.197
transposition of heroism from
one character-focus to another

00:50:48.197 --> 00:50:52.818
while at the same time--
as anybody can recognize who

00:50:52.818 --> 00:50:56.130
has read both stories to their
kids--

00:50:56.130 --> 00:51:00.438
simply rewriting the story in a
way that The Little Engine

00:51:00.438 --> 00:51:03.309
that Could completely
anticipates.

00:51:03.309 --> 00:51:04.449
All right.
 

00:51:04.449 --> 00:51:05.699
So much then for that.
 

00:51:05.699 --> 00:51:10.583
We'll be returning to more
Lacanian pastures on Tuesday

00:51:10.583 --> 00:51:15.650
when we study Deleuze and
Guattari and Slavoj Žižek.

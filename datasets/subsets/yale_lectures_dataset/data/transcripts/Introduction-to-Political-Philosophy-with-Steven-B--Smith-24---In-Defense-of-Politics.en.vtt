00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:04.516
Professor Steven Smith:
Anyway, today,

00:00:04.516 --> 00:00:07.145
the last class,
I had on the syllabus,

00:00:07.145 --> 00:00:10.556
I think it was called
globalization and political

00:00:10.556 --> 00:00:14.748
theory or something to that
effect and I guess since writing

00:00:14.748 --> 00:00:19.011
that I've changed the theme of
this final lecture a bit and I

00:00:19.011 --> 00:00:22.777
want to talk about defending
politics or in defense of

00:00:22.777 --> 00:00:26.756
politics.
And I'll try to explain what I

00:00:26.756 --> 00:00:31.894
mean by that as kind of a wrap
up and exhortation for this last

00:00:31.894 --> 00:00:35.551
class.
In 1962, an English political

00:00:35.551 --> 00:00:41.574
scientist and journalist by the
name of Bernard Crick wrote a

00:00:41.574 --> 00:00:47.396
short and very polemical and
influential little book called

00:00:47.396 --> 00:00:53.397
In Defense of Politics,
and by politics Crick meant a

00:00:53.397 --> 00:00:57.857
distinctive type of human
activity where conflicts of

00:00:57.857 --> 00:01:02.659
interests among groups are
adjudicated by discussion,

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:08.219
persuasion and debate rather
than by force or by fraud.

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:11.815
A political society,
as Crick understood it,

00:01:11.815 --> 00:01:16.749
is one where individuals and
groups played by certain agreed

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:21.767
upon rules that will determine
how conflicts of interests are

00:01:21.767 --> 00:01:25.367
to be decided.
Crick called this little

00:01:25.367 --> 00:01:29.784
book--very lively and still
definitely worth reading--he

00:01:29.784 --> 00:01:34.923
called his book In Defense of
Politics because he regarded

00:01:34.923 --> 00:01:39.501
the proper understanding of
politics as being distorted by

00:01:39.501 --> 00:01:44.319
certain currents of thought and
practice in his own day among

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:48.575
which were for example the
highly ideological style of

00:01:48.575 --> 00:01:53.394
politics found for example in
the Soviet Union and its client

00:01:53.394 --> 00:01:56.984
state,
the kinds of nationalist

00:01:56.984 --> 00:02:00.510
politics emerging in the
developing world,

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:05.241
and even in some aspects of the
conservative politics of

00:02:05.241 --> 00:02:10.229
contemporary Britain of his time
where that meant a kind of

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.960
unreflective deference to
customs and tradition.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:21.175
I think today it's important to
try to reprise Crick's plea for

00:02:21.175 --> 00:02:27.289
a defense of politics although
in a slightly different way.

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:30.350
Politics again,
as Crick understood it,

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:35.101
is something that takes place
within a certain territorially

00:02:35.101 --> 00:02:40.014
defined unit called a "state."
This may seem almost too

00:02:40.014 --> 00:02:44.743
obvious to bear repeating.
For centuries what is called

00:02:44.743 --> 00:02:49.800
the res publica has been
regarded as the proper locus of

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.187
the citizens' loyalty.
It was thought to be the task

00:02:54.187 --> 00:02:58.234
of political philosophy or
political science in its

00:02:58.234 --> 00:03:02.848
original sense to teach or to
give reasons for the love of

00:03:02.848 --> 00:03:07.308
one's own country.
Classical political philosophy

00:03:07.308 --> 00:03:11.379
regarded patriotism as an
ennobling sentiment.

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:16.073
Consider just a few of the
following passages that I asked

00:03:16.073 --> 00:03:19.449
Justin to put on the board from
Cicero,

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:22.361
from Burke, from Machiavelli,
from Rousseau,

00:03:22.361 --> 00:03:25.409
and from Lincoln,
writers from the ancient and

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:29.539
the modern world from many
different countries and times.

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:34.119
All make important expressions,
some more extreme than others

00:03:34.119 --> 00:03:38.165
like Machiavelli's--what else
would one expect from an

00:03:38.165 --> 00:03:42.592
extremist like Machiavelli's--to
simpler and more dignified

00:03:42.592 --> 00:03:47.020
statements like that of Burke or
Lincoln but anyway,

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:52.214
all expressing the view that
politics has something to do

00:03:52.214 --> 00:03:56.759
with providing reasons for the
love of country.

00:03:56.759 --> 00:04:00.076
Today, however,
the idea of patriotism,

00:04:00.076 --> 00:04:05.137
at least among philosophers,
seems to have fallen upon hard

00:04:05.137 --> 00:04:08.176
times.
This isn't to say that

00:04:08.176 --> 00:04:12.609
patriotism, as a phenomenon of
political life,

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:16.839
is likely to disappear.
To the contrary.

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:22.809
Go drive 20 miles or so outside
of any urban area and one is

00:04:22.809 --> 00:04:27.929
likely to see flags being waved,
bumper stickers on cars

00:04:27.929 --> 00:04:32.530
proclaiming the driver's love of
country, country music stations

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.693
playing music that tells us to
support our troops and keep

00:04:36.693 --> 00:04:40.275
driving our SUVs,
all signs of American

00:04:40.275 --> 00:04:44.699
patriotism to be sure.
But the issue seems quite

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:49.310
different in universities and in
educated circles,

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:52.250
you might say,
where patriotism has come to

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:55.680
appear to be a morally
questionable phenomenon.

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.420
Tell someone at any Ivy League
university that you are

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:03.796
interested in patriotism and you
will be treated as if you have

00:05:03.796 --> 00:05:07.959
just expressed a kind of
interest in child pornography.

00:05:07.959 --> 00:05:12.927
Raise the issue and one is
likely to hear very quickly

00:05:12.927 --> 00:05:18.926
repeated Samuel Johnson's famous
barb that patriotism is the last

00:05:18.926 --> 00:05:23.519
refuge of a scoundrel or you
might even hear,

00:05:23.519 --> 00:05:26.472
if the person's read a little
bit more, E.M.

00:05:26.472 --> 00:05:30.660
Forster's famous statement that
if he had to choose whether to

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:33.750
betray his friend or his country
that he,

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:38.860
Forster, wished he had the
courage to betray his country.

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:43.622
Forster, the famous English
novelist, author of Howards

00:05:43.622 --> 00:05:46.629
End and other important
books,

00:05:46.629 --> 00:05:51.959
Forster presents the choice
between friendship over country,

00:05:51.959 --> 00:05:57.344
of private over public goods,
as a kind of tragic and even

00:05:57.344 --> 00:06:00.759
noble decision that one has to
make.

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:03.094
But Forster,
in some respect,

00:06:03.094 --> 00:06:05.512
has given us,
I would suggest,

00:06:05.512 --> 00:06:10.670
a false dilemma.
Loyalty is a moral habit just

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:16.260
as betrayal is a moral vice.
People who practice one are

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.140
less likely to indulge in the
other.

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:23.494
Consider the following example.
A few years after Forster made

00:06:23.494 --> 00:06:27.437
his statement at Cambridge,
I believe, three young

00:06:27.437 --> 00:06:31.944
Cambridge undergraduates in the
1930s by the names of Kim

00:06:31.944 --> 00:06:33.841
Philby,
Donald Maclean,

00:06:33.841 --> 00:06:36.760
and Guy Burgess,
I don't know if those are names

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:40.610
that are familiar to people here
any longer but they were very,

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:44.398
very famous names at one point,
they chose to betray their own

00:06:44.398 --> 00:06:47.716
country.
That is to say they acted for

00:06:47.716 --> 00:06:52.324
many years as Soviet agents and
for years passed on vital

00:06:52.324 --> 00:06:54.561
secrets,
English secrets,

00:06:54.561 --> 00:06:59.136
to Moscow, as they all ascended
up the ladder of British

00:06:59.136 --> 00:07:04.044
intelligence services until they
were finally exposed in the

00:07:04.044 --> 00:07:07.270
1950s.
And it was not long after they

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:11.814
were exposed and they had all
fled to Moscow that they began

00:07:11.814 --> 00:07:15.141
to betray one another.
Loyalty it seems,

00:07:15.141 --> 00:07:18.356
like betrayal,
is not a bus that one can

00:07:18.356 --> 00:07:23.192
simply get off at will.
Rather, people who betray

00:07:23.192 --> 00:07:29.223
others in one area of life are
likely to do so as well in

00:07:29.223 --> 00:07:32.434
others.
So Forster has given us a false

00:07:32.434 --> 00:07:35.809
choice between choosing
friendship over country or

00:07:35.809 --> 00:07:39.389
country over friendship and as
with most matters,

00:07:39.389 --> 00:07:43.381
I think it probably makes
greater sense to examine the

00:07:43.381 --> 00:07:47.223
problem through the lenses of
Aristotle who tells us

00:07:47.223 --> 00:07:51.139
everything we need to know about
most questions.

00:07:51.139 --> 00:07:54.039
In the Nicomachean
Ethic, Aristotle taught us

00:07:54.039 --> 00:07:56.029
that all virtues,
that is to say,

00:07:56.029 --> 00:08:02.152
all excellences of mind and
heart, are best understood as a

00:08:02.152 --> 00:08:07.430
mean along a continuum of excess
and deficiency.

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:11.406
It is a matter of finding a
balance, the proper balance,

00:08:11.406 --> 00:08:15.080
between extremes.
So it might be useful to regard

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:19.166
patriotism in this light.
If patriotism is a virtue,

00:08:19.166 --> 00:08:23.976
and I ask the question "if it
is," it would be important to

00:08:23.976 --> 00:08:28.620
see it as a midpoint between two
contending extremes,

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:32.346
two contending vices.
What are these vices,

00:08:32.346 --> 00:08:35.687
you might say,
that obscure from us the

00:08:35.687 --> 00:08:40.700
meaning of--the proper meaning
of the political today?

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:42.973
On one side,
you could say,

00:08:42.973 --> 00:08:48.218
the excess of patriotism is a
kind of nationalistic zeal that

00:08:48.218 --> 00:08:53.289
holds absolute attachment to
one's country and one's way of

00:08:53.289 --> 00:08:58.761
life as unconditionally good.
This is the kind of loyalty

00:08:58.761 --> 00:09:04.029
expressed in sentiments like,
"My country right or wrong,"

00:09:04.029 --> 00:09:08.223
but was given powerful
expression, perhaps the most

00:09:08.223 --> 00:09:12.416
powerful expression,
in a short book- another short

00:09:12.416 --> 00:09:17.363
book in this case by a German
legal philosopher of the early

00:09:17.363 --> 00:09:20.970
twentieth century named Carl
Schmitt.

00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:26.554
Carl Schmitt wrote a short book
called The Concept of the

00:09:26.554 --> 00:09:31.949
Political in 1921 and here
Schmitt drew extensively on

00:09:31.949 --> 00:09:37.250
Hobbes but rather to defend a
view of the political,

00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:43.584
but rather than tying the state
of war, Hobbes' state of war,

00:09:43.584 --> 00:09:47.490
to a pre-political state of
nature,

00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:52.446
Schmitt saw war and also which
includes the preparation for

00:09:52.446 --> 00:09:56.720
war, as the inescapable
condition of human life,

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:59.840
of political life.
Man, he believed,

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:04.551
is the dangerous animal because
we can kill one another and

00:10:04.551 --> 00:10:08.332
individuals,
and more importantly groups of

00:10:08.332 --> 00:10:13.202
individuals, stand to one
another in a virtually continual

00:10:13.202 --> 00:10:17.528
state of conflict and war.
Schmitt believed Hobbes was

00:10:17.528 --> 00:10:21.569
right in many crucial respects
but where he fell down was in

00:10:21.569 --> 00:10:24.856
believing that the social
contract could create a

00:10:24.856 --> 00:10:28.280
sovereign state that would put
an end to war.

00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:32.808
Quite the contrary, he thought.
The inescapable political fact

00:10:32.808 --> 00:10:36.873
is therefore the distinction
between what he called friend

00:10:36.873 --> 00:10:40.097
and enemy,
those who are with us and those

00:10:40.097 --> 00:10:42.763
who are against us.
To misunderstand that

00:10:42.763 --> 00:10:45.750
distinction, distinction that
goes all the way back to

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:48.230
Polemarchus' view in the
Republic,

00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:51.756
where he talks about justice
being doing good to friends and

00:10:51.756 --> 00:10:55.044
harm to enemies but might
obviously go on much deeper or

00:10:55.044 --> 00:10:57.256
further than that.
For Schmitt,

00:10:57.256 --> 00:11:01.889
that distinction was central to
what he called the political.

00:11:01.889 --> 00:11:05.152
The political,
he says, and he uses that word

00:11:05.152 --> 00:11:09.156
as a noun, we tend to think of
political largely in its

00:11:09.156 --> 00:11:12.672
adjectival form,
but in Germany you can often

00:11:12.672 --> 00:11:15.698
use it as a noun as well.
The political,

00:11:15.698 --> 00:11:19.929
he wrote, is the most intense
and extreme antagonism,

00:11:19.929 --> 00:11:23.590
becomes that much more
political the closer it

00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:27.938
approaches to the extreme point,
that of the friend,

00:11:27.938 --> 00:11:29.700
enemy grouping,
he says.

00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:33.620
Friend and enemy are the
inescapable categories through

00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:37.250
which we experience what he
calls the political.

00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:41.539
Life consists of that
fundamental distinction.

00:11:41.539 --> 00:11:45.951
Athens and Sparta,
Red Sox and Yankees,

00:11:45.951 --> 00:11:51.639
Harvard and Yale--These are
fundamental groupings,

00:11:51.639 --> 00:11:57.187
enemies, friends and enemies.
All humanitarian appeals,

00:11:57.187 --> 00:12:00.142
he believed,
appeals to the concept of human

00:12:00.142 --> 00:12:02.730
rights,
to free trade or so on,

00:12:02.730 --> 00:12:06.530
all of these are,
as it were, attempts to avoid

00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:11.652
the fundamental fact of conflict
and the need for a politics of

00:12:11.652 --> 00:12:15.474
group solidarity.
The politics of the future,

00:12:15.474 --> 00:12:20.002
he hoped, would be determined
by those who have the courage to

00:12:20.002 --> 00:12:24.529
recognize this fundamental
distinction and to act upon it.

00:12:24.529 --> 00:12:28.335
At the other end,
however, of the continuum of

00:12:28.335 --> 00:12:31.379
excess and deficiency,
the defect,

00:12:31.379 --> 00:12:35.366
you might say,
of patriotism comes to light as

00:12:35.366 --> 00:12:39.618
a kind of today what we might
call transpolitical

00:12:39.618 --> 00:12:44.022
cosmopolitanism.
Present day cosmopolitanism is,

00:12:44.022 --> 00:12:48.267
to a very large degree,
a product of another German

00:12:48.267 --> 00:12:53.022
philosopher named Immanuel Kant
writing at the end of the

00:12:53.022 --> 00:12:56.058
eighteenth century.
Kant stressed,

00:12:56.058 --> 00:12:59.125
on the other hand,
that our moral duties and

00:12:59.125 --> 00:13:03.475
obligations respect no national
or political or other kinds of

00:13:03.475 --> 00:13:07.248
parochial boundaries,
whatever boundaries such as

00:13:07.248 --> 00:13:10.162
race, class, ethnicity,
political loyalty,

00:13:10.162 --> 00:13:12.300
and the like.
On this view,

00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:15.455
on Kant's view,
that is, we owe no greater

00:13:15.455 --> 00:13:19.995
moral obligations to fellow
citizens than to any other human

00:13:19.995 --> 00:13:22.919
beings on the face of the
planet.

00:13:22.919 --> 00:13:26.685
Citizenship--if I can use
language that is not exactly

00:13:26.685 --> 00:13:30.877
Kant's own, but is largely sort
of identified with a kind of

00:13:30.877 --> 00:13:33.790
Kantian move in
philosophy--citizenship is

00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:37.768
simply an arbitrary fact
conferred on individuals through

00:13:37.768 --> 00:13:41.056
the accident of birth.
But since birthright

00:13:41.056 --> 00:13:44.527
citizenship is an artifact of
what you might call a pure sort

00:13:44.527 --> 00:13:47.911
of genetic lottery,
there are no moral or special

00:13:47.911 --> 00:13:51.627
obligations attached to it.
The Kantian emphasis on

00:13:51.627 --> 00:13:54.764
universality,
that is to say that there is a

00:13:54.764 --> 00:13:58.338
moral law that can be
universalized and held to be

00:13:58.338 --> 00:14:02.668
true for all human beings,
stressed for Kant that we are

00:14:02.668 --> 00:14:06.019
all parts of what he called a
kingdom of ends,

00:14:06.019 --> 00:14:11.170
a universal kingdom of ends
where every individual is due

00:14:11.170 --> 00:14:16.780
equal moral value and respect
because simply of their humanity

00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:19.866
alone.
That idea of a cosmopolitan

00:14:19.866 --> 00:14:22.434
ethic of humanity,
Kant believed,

00:14:22.434 --> 00:14:27.330
could only be realized in a
republican form of government,

00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:30.249
today what we might call a
democracy, or,

00:14:30.249 --> 00:14:33.971
to speak more precisely,
what Kant believed it could

00:14:33.971 --> 00:14:37.255
only hold true in a
confederation of republics

00:14:37.255 --> 00:14:40.539
overseen or ruled by
international law.

00:14:40.539 --> 00:14:43.212
Kant was perhaps,
I don't know if he was the

00:14:43.212 --> 00:14:46.942
first, but he gave the first,
he gave the most powerful early

00:14:46.942 --> 00:14:50.049
expression to the idea of a
league of nations,

00:14:50.049 --> 00:14:54.131
a league of nations that would
put an end to war altogether

00:14:54.131 --> 00:14:57.932
between states for the sake of
achieving what he called

00:14:57.932 --> 00:15:02.768
perpetual peace,
the title of a famous essay of

00:15:02.768 --> 00:15:04.575
his.
Hobbes and Locke,

00:15:04.575 --> 00:15:07.264
he believed,
were wrong in attributing

00:15:07.264 --> 00:15:10.971
sovereignty, absolute
sovereignty, to the individual

00:15:10.971 --> 00:15:13.756
nation state.
For Kant, the state,

00:15:13.756 --> 00:15:16.708
the individual state,
is merely a kind of

00:15:16.708 --> 00:15:20.990
developmental stage along the
path to a world republic,

00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:26.210
a world republic of states
organized around the idea of

00:15:26.210 --> 00:15:30.717
international law and peace.
Only in, he believed,

00:15:30.717 --> 00:15:35.157
a league of republics would
peace among the nations finally

00:15:35.157 --> 00:15:39.214
be realized and would
individuals be able to treat one

00:15:39.214 --> 00:15:42.200
another as ends rather than
means.

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:46.061
If you want just some
indication of how influential

00:15:46.061 --> 00:15:50.001
Kant's view has been,
you can think that his idea of

00:15:50.001 --> 00:15:54.403
an international league of
nations came to fruition over a

00:15:54.403 --> 00:15:58.574
century after his life in
Woodrow Wilson's famous 14

00:15:58.574 --> 00:16:02.977
Points issued after the
first world war and elaborated

00:16:02.977 --> 00:16:07.225
more fully in the United
Nations Declaration of Human

00:16:07.225 --> 00:16:11.398
Rights of 1948,
all of which bear the

00:16:11.398 --> 00:16:14.700
unmistakable imprint of Immanuel
Kant.

00:16:18.009 --> 00:16:21.812
Now, neither of these views,
let me argue,

00:16:21.812 --> 00:16:25.708
either of these views,
Schmitt's or Kant's,

00:16:25.708 --> 00:16:30.159
really captures the nature of
the political.

00:16:30.159 --> 00:16:32.669
Let me start adequately so at
least.

00:16:32.669 --> 00:16:35.269
Let me start with--return to
Schmitt again.

00:16:35.269 --> 00:16:39.634
Schmitt's view is rooted,
I believe, in a very important

00:16:39.634 --> 00:16:43.325
human truth, namely,
the world is a dangerous,

00:16:43.325 --> 00:16:47.762
in fact, very dangerous place,
like in many ways Hobbes or

00:16:47.762 --> 00:16:50.859
Machiavelli,
Schmitt takes the extreme

00:16:50.859 --> 00:16:54.717
situation, that is to say,
the situation of war and

00:16:54.717 --> 00:16:58.661
mobilization for war,
and turns it into the norm,

00:16:58.661 --> 00:17:01.450
turns it into the normal
situation.

00:17:01.450 --> 00:17:05.046
An extreme situation is one
where the very survival,

00:17:05.046 --> 00:17:08.289
in fact, the very independence
of a society,

00:17:08.289 --> 00:17:12.821
is at stake and for Schmitt
every situation is potentially a

00:17:12.821 --> 00:17:17.276
life and death struggle against
a kind of existential enemy

00:17:17.276 --> 00:17:21.808
where one must decide to choose
up sides between friends and

00:17:21.808 --> 00:17:24.454
enemy.
Politics, for him,

00:17:24.454 --> 00:17:29.916
is a kind of endless struggle
for power guided by national

00:17:29.916 --> 00:17:34.315
self-interest alone.
And yet, it would seem to me,

00:17:34.315 --> 00:17:38.706
a politics of unremitting war
and preparation for war would

00:17:38.706 --> 00:17:41.507
be, have to be,
self-defeating even in

00:17:41.507 --> 00:17:44.406
Schmitt's own terms.
For example,

00:17:44.406 --> 00:17:49.608
why should the struggle between
friend and enemy be exclusively

00:17:49.608 --> 00:17:53.299
what we might call an interstate
rivalry?

00:17:53.299 --> 00:17:58.083
Wouldn't competition between
individuals and groups just as

00:17:58.083 --> 00:18:02.619
easily become a feature of
domestic politics as well?

00:18:02.619 --> 00:18:08.120
Why is war something that takes
place exclusively between states

00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:13.130
rather than within them,
as the logic of bitter rivalry

00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:18.610
and competition and friend and
enemy cuts all the way down,

00:18:18.610 --> 00:18:21.426
so to speak?
The logic of Schmitt's

00:18:21.426 --> 00:18:24.111
argument, at least as I
understand it,

00:18:24.111 --> 00:18:28.610
points not only to war between
states but ongoing civil war and

00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:33.822
civil conflicts within states,
between rival groups expressing

00:18:33.822 --> 00:18:38.649
their own desire for power and
their own loyalty to their

00:18:38.649 --> 00:18:42.325
individual groups.
The result of this logic of

00:18:42.325 --> 00:18:45.710
conflict, it seems to me,
would be the negation of

00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:49.431
politics,
that is to say the destruction

00:18:49.431 --> 00:18:54.829
of the sovereign state as the
locus of political power.

00:18:54.829 --> 00:18:57.895
Why should, again,
the choice of friend and enemy

00:18:57.895 --> 00:19:01.279
be a choice between states
rather than individuals.

00:19:01.279 --> 00:19:05.077
But let me then turn to Kant's
view, cosmopolitanism,

00:19:05.077 --> 00:19:08.948
because if the effect of
Schmitt's distinction between

00:19:08.948 --> 00:19:13.329
friend and enemy is to make
politics identical with war,

00:19:13.329 --> 00:19:19.223
the effect of Kantian
cosmopolitanism is to confuse

00:19:19.223 --> 00:19:24.437
politics with morality.
Kant and his present day

00:19:24.437 --> 00:19:30.199
followers wish to transcend the
sovereign state and replace it

00:19:30.199 --> 00:19:34.450
with known international rules
of justice.

00:19:34.450 --> 00:19:38.489
If Schmitt believed that man is
the dangerous animal,

00:19:38.489 --> 00:19:42.839
Kant believed man is simply the
rule following animal.

00:19:42.839 --> 00:19:46.207
But Kant's desire,
it seems to me,

00:19:46.207 --> 00:19:52.024
to transcend the state with a
kind of international forum,

00:19:52.024 --> 00:19:55.799
is both naive and
anti-political.

00:19:55.799 --> 00:20:00.063
If Hobbes was right when he
said that covenants without the

00:20:00.063 --> 00:20:03.613
sword are but words,
the question is who will

00:20:03.613 --> 00:20:07.319
enforce these international
norms of justice?

00:20:07.319 --> 00:20:12.308
Kant's conception of a kind of
global justice is to wish a

00:20:12.308 --> 00:20:16.509
world without states,
a world without boundaries,

00:20:16.509 --> 00:20:20.009
a world, in short,
without politics.

00:20:20.009 --> 00:20:23.844
International bodies like the
United Nations have been

00:20:23.844 --> 00:20:27.606
notoriously ineffective in
curbing or restraining the

00:20:27.606 --> 00:20:31.657
aggressive behavior of states
and international courts of

00:20:31.657 --> 00:20:35.925
justice like that in the Hague
have been highly selective in

00:20:35.925 --> 00:20:40.558
what they choose to condemn.
It would seem that reliance on

00:20:40.558 --> 00:20:43.870
such bodies would have the
further disadvantage of

00:20:43.870 --> 00:20:46.710
uprooting people from their
traditions,

00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:51.581
from their local arrangements
that most people find as a

00:20:51.581 --> 00:20:56.921
source of reverence or awe.
There seems to be little room

00:20:56.921 --> 00:21:02.369
for reverence for the sacred,
in the cosmopolitan ideal.

00:21:02.369 --> 00:21:06.425
The logic of this view,
the logic of Kant's view for

00:21:06.425 --> 00:21:09.923
perpetual peace,
necessarily leads to a world

00:21:09.923 --> 00:21:14.331
state, world government.
Even Kant admitted that a world

00:21:14.331 --> 00:21:17.990
state would be what he called a
soulless despotism.

00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:22.151
He was opposed to the idea of a
world state, but the logic of

00:21:22.151 --> 00:21:25.410
his argument leads him
inescapably in that view,

00:21:25.410 --> 00:21:29.247
in that vein.
The idea underlying perpetual

00:21:29.247 --> 00:21:34.288
peace is that human life as
such, human life independent

00:21:34.288 --> 00:21:39.970
that is of the kind of life one
leads, is an absolute good.

00:21:39.970 --> 00:21:43.029
Such an idea,
I think, can only lead in the

00:21:43.029 --> 00:21:46.089
long run to moral decay,
that is to say,

00:21:46.089 --> 00:21:50.713
to a kind of inability or
unwillingness to dedicate one's

00:21:50.713 --> 00:21:54.264
life to ideals,
to the relatively few things

00:21:54.264 --> 00:21:57.650
that give life wholeness and
meaning.

00:21:57.650 --> 00:22:01.855
The cosmopolitan state would
be--the world state would be the

00:22:01.855 --> 00:22:05.009
home of what Nietzsche called
the last man,

00:22:05.009 --> 00:22:08.549
a world where nothing really
matters, where there is nothing

00:22:08.549 --> 00:22:13.443
really of importance left to do,
a world of entertainments,

00:22:13.443 --> 00:22:17.393
a world of fun,
a world void of moral

00:22:17.393 --> 00:22:21.011
seriousness.
So these two extremes,

00:22:21.011 --> 00:22:23.789
nationalism and
cosmopolitanism,

00:22:23.789 --> 00:22:29.255
are today the two doctrines or
tendencies that tend to obscure

00:22:29.255 --> 00:22:32.660
the true nature of the
political.

00:22:32.660 --> 00:22:37.992
Each of these extremes contains
at best a part of the truth,

00:22:37.992 --> 00:22:41.317
a partial truth.
The nationalist is surely

00:22:41.317 --> 00:22:44.983
correct in some respect,
to see that politics is always

00:22:44.983 --> 00:22:48.460
a matter of the particular,
particular states,

00:22:48.460 --> 00:22:51.740
particular nations,
particular peoples and

00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:54.458
traditions.
For the nationalist,

00:22:54.458 --> 00:22:58.934
the particular stands for
something infinitely higher and

00:22:58.934 --> 00:23:03.170
more noble than the cosmopolitan
or the universal.

00:23:03.170 --> 00:23:06.596
We enter the world as members
of a particular family,

00:23:06.596 --> 00:23:09.995
in a particular neighborhood,
in a particular state,

00:23:09.995 --> 00:23:12.890
in a particular part of the
country and so on.

00:23:12.890 --> 00:23:16.484
We are a composite of
particularities and these

00:23:16.484 --> 00:23:19.141
attachments, these
particularities,

00:23:19.141 --> 00:23:24.220
are not something extraneous or
accidental to our identities.

00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:27.299
They are what make us who we
are.

00:23:27.299 --> 00:23:31.644
The demand that we give up our
particular identities and assume

00:23:31.644 --> 00:23:35.989
a kind of cosmopolitan point of
view would be the same thing to

00:23:35.989 --> 00:23:38.910
ask us,
at least those who are native

00:23:38.910 --> 00:23:42.470
English speakers,
to give up speaking English and

00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:46.049
adopt Esperanto,
the artificial false language.

00:23:46.049 --> 00:23:48.697
I would ask,
who was the Shakespeare or

00:23:48.697 --> 00:23:51.224
Milton of Esperanto?
In other words,

00:23:51.224 --> 00:23:55.400
everything great derives from
something rooted and particular.

00:23:55.400 --> 00:24:00.650
This is the morality of what
you might call common ties.

00:24:00.650 --> 00:24:04.483
But there is also some truth on
the cosmopolitan side,

00:24:04.483 --> 00:24:07.930
on the other hand.
Are we simply determined or

00:24:07.930 --> 00:24:12.303
condemned by the accident of
birth to live by the traditions

00:24:12.303 --> 00:24:16.378
of the particular nation in
which we happen to have been

00:24:16.378 --> 00:24:19.359
born?
Doesn't this deny what seems to

00:24:19.359 --> 00:24:22.827
be highest in us,
that is to say our capacity for

00:24:22.827 --> 00:24:25.988
choice,
to detach ourselves from our

00:24:25.988 --> 00:24:29.732
surroundings,
to determine for ourselves how

00:24:29.732 --> 00:24:34.441
we will live and who we will be?
This idea of choice,

00:24:34.441 --> 00:24:38.429
of being able to choose for
oneself, is, I think,

00:24:38.429 --> 00:24:42.750
at the bottom of our experience
of human dignity.

00:24:42.750 --> 00:24:47.121
We experience our moral worth
as human beings through our

00:24:47.121 --> 00:24:51.258
ability to choose how we will
live, with whom to live,

00:24:51.258 --> 00:24:54.968
and under what conditions.
This kind of ideal,

00:24:54.968 --> 00:24:58.785
this cosmopolitan ethic,
has the virtue of allowing us

00:24:58.785 --> 00:25:02.529
to stand outside of our
particular situation and view

00:25:02.529 --> 00:25:05.316
ourselves from,
what you might call,

00:25:05.316 --> 00:25:08.345
the standpoint of the
disinterested spectator,

00:25:08.345 --> 00:25:11.509
from a higher or more general
point of view.

00:25:11.509 --> 00:25:14.930
And clearly,
such a morality gives us a kind

00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:19.383
of critical distance or vantage
point on how we can judge

00:25:19.383 --> 00:25:23.463
ourselves and our society.
From this point of view,

00:25:23.463 --> 00:25:26.639
our local and particular
attachment to family,

00:25:26.639 --> 00:25:30.449
friends, fellow citizens,
again carries no overwhelming

00:25:30.449 --> 00:25:34.500
moral weight.
We must view them as we would

00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:38.815
view anyone or anything else,
disinterestedly,

00:25:38.815 --> 00:25:42.555
objectively,
and this one might call the

00:25:42.555 --> 00:25:47.444
morality of cosmopolitanism.
Each of these ethics,

00:25:47.444 --> 00:25:51.714
the ethic of communal ties,
the ethic of cosmopolitan

00:25:51.714 --> 00:25:54.482
individualism,
express, again,

00:25:54.482 --> 00:26:00.157
an important piece of the truth
of politics although neither is

00:26:00.157 --> 00:26:05.308
alone complete in itself.
How to combine them or what

00:26:05.308 --> 00:26:08.150
should we do?
In many respects,

00:26:08.150 --> 00:26:11.947
I think these two ethics,
these two forms of

00:26:11.947 --> 00:26:15.918
ethos,
are very much combined already

00:26:15.918 --> 00:26:21.122
in the American regime and how
the American way of life should

00:26:21.122 --> 00:26:26.420
be properly understood.
Consider the following.

00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:30.422
American regime is the first
truly modern nation,

00:26:30.422 --> 00:26:33.758
that is to say,
a nation founded upon the

00:26:33.758 --> 00:26:38.126
principles of modern philosophy.
Our founding document,

00:26:38.126 --> 00:26:40.611
the Charter of American
Liberties,

00:26:40.611 --> 00:26:43.220
the Declaration of
Independence,

00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:49.509
is dedicated to the proposition
that all men are created equal.

00:26:49.509 --> 00:26:52.623
It is fair to say that the
American regime requires more

00:26:52.623 --> 00:26:54.831
than loyalty,
that is to say it requires

00:26:54.831 --> 00:26:57.916
understanding,
it requires understanding of

00:26:57.916 --> 00:27:02.270
that founding principle or that
proposition, and the various

00:27:02.270 --> 00:27:06.108
texts and debates in which that
proposition was later

00:27:06.108 --> 00:27:10.831
articulated as well as the range
of responses and alternatives to

00:27:10.831 --> 00:27:13.125
it.
To believe for example,

00:27:13.125 --> 00:27:16.371
as you all now know,
to believe that "all men are

00:27:16.371 --> 00:27:20.496
created equal and endowed with
unalienable rights" requires us

00:27:20.496 --> 00:27:24.147
to consider the opposite
proposition contained in books

00:27:24.147 --> 00:27:28.407
like Plato's Republic or
Aristotle's Politics that

00:27:28.407 --> 00:27:32.194
believe that human beings are
not equal and that the best

00:27:32.194 --> 00:27:36.589
regime is one governed by a
philosophical aristocracy.

00:27:36.589 --> 00:27:41.330
So to consider our regime means
in some ways to consider it in

00:27:41.330 --> 00:27:44.750
the light of these universal
alternatives.

00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:49.181
But ours is also a regime that
contains elements of both the

00:27:49.181 --> 00:27:53.481
universal and the particular.
Again, the American regime is

00:27:53.481 --> 00:27:57.630
one founded on what Jefferson
called "a self-evident truth,"

00:27:57.630 --> 00:28:00.560
the truth that there are
certain unalienable rights,

00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:03.893
that these principles are not
simply true for Americans but

00:28:03.893 --> 00:28:06.480
believed to be good for all
human beings,

00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:10.301
always and everywhere.
Consider Tom Paine in The

00:28:10.301 --> 00:28:13.968
Rights of Man where Paine
writes, "The independence of

00:28:13.968 --> 00:28:17.828
America was accompanied by a
revolution in the principles and

00:28:17.828 --> 00:28:21.887
practice of government,
government founded on a moral

00:28:21.887 --> 00:28:25.624
theory," he says,
"on the indefeasible hereditary

00:28:25.624 --> 00:28:30.140
rights of man that is now
revolving from west to east."

00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:32.484
In other words,
far from suggesting a

00:28:32.484 --> 00:28:35.089
traditional form of communal
morality,

00:28:35.089 --> 00:28:38.418
American politics,
as Paine suggests there,

00:28:38.418 --> 00:28:41.510
requires a commitment to the
highest,

00:28:41.510 --> 00:28:45.842
most universal moral principles.
That seems to be the

00:28:45.842 --> 00:28:50.412
cosmopolitan dimension upon
which the very nature of the

00:28:50.412 --> 00:28:56.469
American regime rests.
But the question does not end

00:28:56.469 --> 00:28:59.324
there.
The principles of Jefferson and

00:28:59.324 --> 00:29:02.440
Paine once again did not arise
sui generis.

00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:06.668
Anyone knows Jefferson's
principles about equality and

00:29:06.668 --> 00:29:11.295
rights have their profound
source in the philosophy of John

00:29:11.295 --> 00:29:15.284
Locke and particularly in his
Second Treatise of

00:29:15.284 --> 00:29:19.315
Government.
Recall that Locke occupies a

00:29:19.315 --> 00:29:23.688
central moment in the
development of the modern state

00:29:23.688 --> 00:29:28.146
and his new idea of a kind of
industrious and rational

00:29:28.146 --> 00:29:31.285
citizen.
Locke's philosophy emerged not

00:29:31.285 --> 00:29:34.831
only in conversation with the
other great founders of

00:29:34.831 --> 00:29:37.900
modernity like Machiavelli and
Hobbes but,

00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:41.910
in some important sense,
it emerged in opposition to the

00:29:41.910 --> 00:29:45.483
tradition of the classical
republic whose greatest

00:29:45.483 --> 00:29:48.764
representatives were Plato,
Aristotle, Cicero,

00:29:48.764 --> 00:29:51.310
and Polybius.
It would seem then,

00:29:51.310 --> 00:29:53.938
in other words,
to be an American citizen in

00:29:53.938 --> 00:29:57.421
the fullest sense of the term
requires an immersion in the

00:29:57.421 --> 00:30:00.660
philosophical tradition because
only in America,

00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:04.278
of all the countries in the
world I believe,

00:30:04.278 --> 00:30:08.823
does the philosophical
tradition remain most deeply and

00:30:08.823 --> 00:30:12.035
truly alive.
And yet at the same time,

00:30:12.035 --> 00:30:16.588
the American regime requires an
understanding and appreciation

00:30:16.588 --> 00:30:21.140
not only for a set of abstract
philosophical ideas and debates

00:30:21.140 --> 00:30:26.371
but for a constitution,
its history and a distinctive

00:30:26.371 --> 00:30:29.965
way of life.
A regime is obviously more than

00:30:29.965 --> 00:30:33.348
a catalog of philosophical
doctrines and abstract

00:30:33.348 --> 00:30:37.154
propositions but is embedded
within a particular set of

00:30:37.154 --> 00:30:39.365
moral,
legal, political,

00:30:39.365 --> 00:30:44.515
constitutional practices that
give it color and distinguish it

00:30:44.515 --> 00:30:48.403
from all others.
A proper understanding of the

00:30:48.403 --> 00:30:53.049
particular regime requires
today, or requires at any time,

00:30:53.049 --> 00:30:56.461
an immersion in history,
not only philosophy but in

00:30:56.461 --> 00:31:00.009
history, and I mean by history
not social history,

00:31:00.009 --> 00:31:03.176
economic history or even
cultural history,

00:31:03.176 --> 00:31:06.730
but history in the proper sense
of the term,

00:31:06.730 --> 00:31:11.604
that is political history.
Political history presupposes

00:31:11.604 --> 00:31:16.075
the centrality of politics,
of how the constitution of any

00:31:16.075 --> 00:31:20.781
society and its most fundamental
laws shape the character and

00:31:20.781 --> 00:31:25.619
choices of its citizen body.
Political history concerns the

00:31:25.619 --> 00:31:29.069
struggle of individuals and
groups for power.

00:31:29.069 --> 00:31:32.770
It concerns the political uses
of power or, maybe to speak a

00:31:32.770 --> 00:31:37.461
little more clearly,
of the two great ends to which

00:31:37.461 --> 00:31:42.430
power can be put,
namely freedom and empire.

00:31:42.430 --> 00:31:47.950
Political philosophy is related
to political history.

00:31:47.950 --> 00:31:51.996
In fact, political history or
political philosophy presuppose

00:31:51.996 --> 00:31:55.841
one another in the same way or
in the same relation of the

00:31:55.841 --> 00:31:59.992
universal to the particular.
While the political philosopher

00:31:59.992 --> 00:32:03.270
studies the principles,
the underlying principles of

00:32:03.270 --> 00:32:05.908
the regime,
the political historian

00:32:05.908 --> 00:32:09.913
examines the way those
principles have been applied in

00:32:09.913 --> 00:32:12.239
practice.
While the philosopher is

00:32:12.239 --> 00:32:15.432
concerned with the best regime,
the regime that is best

00:32:15.432 --> 00:32:17.680
according to unchanging
principles,

00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:21.814
the historian is concerned with
what is best for a particular

00:32:21.814 --> 00:32:24.569
people at a particular time and
place,

00:32:24.569 --> 00:32:29.240
Athenians, Frenchmen,
Americans and so on.

00:32:29.240 --> 00:32:32.991
And this is what the greatest
political historians,

00:32:32.991 --> 00:32:36.143
Thucydides, Theodor Mommsen,
Lord Macaulay,

00:32:36.143 --> 00:32:39.519
Henry Adams,
this is what they have done.

00:32:39.519 --> 00:32:42.764
They have examined how
different regimes,

00:32:42.764 --> 00:32:47.549
both express but also depart
from fundamental principles.

00:32:47.549 --> 00:32:51.221
When Adams, for example,
examines in painstaking detail

00:32:51.221 --> 00:32:55.368
the acquisition of the Louisiana
Territory under the Jefferson

00:32:55.368 --> 00:32:59.511
administration,
he does so always against the

00:32:59.511 --> 00:33:05.213
backdrop of Jeffersonian ideals
about democracy and limited

00:33:05.213 --> 00:33:08.493
government.
But that leads us to the final

00:33:08.493 --> 00:33:11.412
question that I want to end
with, is the proper

00:33:11.412 --> 00:33:14.775
understanding and appreciation
of the political is not

00:33:14.775 --> 00:33:18.201
something we inherit but
obviously something we must be

00:33:18.201 --> 00:33:21.105
taught.
Like anything that must be

00:33:21.105 --> 00:33:26.080
taught, it requires teachers.
But where are such teachers to

00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:31.121
be found at least today?
It would seem only very rarely

00:33:31.121 --> 00:33:36.501
in universities and rarer still
in departments of history,

00:33:36.501 --> 00:33:43.299
political science or economics.
Excuse my polemic.

00:33:43.299 --> 00:33:46.229
Modern professors of history,
for example,

00:33:46.229 --> 00:33:49.944
often appear to teach
everything but a proper respect

00:33:49.944 --> 00:33:53.062
for tradition.
One would get the impression

00:33:53.062 --> 00:33:56.989
from many classes that America
alone among the nations of the

00:33:56.989 --> 00:34:01.794
world is responsible for racism,
homophobia, the despoliation of

00:34:01.794 --> 00:34:06.660
the planet and every other moral
evil that one can imagine.

00:34:06.660 --> 00:34:09.165
In my own field,
political science,

00:34:09.165 --> 00:34:13.439
that once designated the skill
or art possessed by the most

00:34:13.439 --> 00:34:16.239
excellent statesmen or
politician,

00:34:16.239 --> 00:34:20.572
civic education has been
replaced by something called

00:34:20.572 --> 00:34:25.321
"game theory" that regards
politics as a marketplace where

00:34:25.321 --> 00:34:29.486
individual preferences are
formed and utilities are

00:34:29.486 --> 00:34:33.236
maximized.
Rather than teaching students

00:34:33.236 --> 00:34:36.736
to think of themselves as
citizens as these

00:34:36.736 --> 00:34:40.827
members--individuals did,
the new political science

00:34:40.827 --> 00:34:45.115
treats us as something called
rational actors who exercise our

00:34:45.115 --> 00:34:47.725
preferences,
but the question is,

00:34:47.725 --> 00:34:50.525
what should we have a
preference for,

00:34:50.525 --> 00:34:53.869
how should rational choice be
exercised?

00:34:53.869 --> 00:34:56.717
On these questions,
that is to say the most

00:34:56.717 --> 00:35:00.244
fundamental questions,
our political science is sadly

00:35:00.244 --> 00:35:03.118
silent.
It has nothing to offer and

00:35:03.118 --> 00:35:06.395
nothing to say.
By reducing all politics to

00:35:06.395 --> 00:35:10.351
choice and all choice to
preference, the new political

00:35:10.351 --> 00:35:14.606
science is forced to accord
legitimacy to every preference

00:35:14.606 --> 00:35:19.610
however vile,
base or indecent it may be.

00:35:19.610 --> 00:35:24.148
That kind of value neutrality
towards preferences is akin to

00:35:24.148 --> 00:35:28.380
the philosophic disposition that
we know as nihilism,

00:35:28.380 --> 00:35:32.396
that is to say the belief that
our deepest principles and

00:35:32.396 --> 00:35:36.269
convictions are nothing more
than blind preferences.

00:35:36.269 --> 00:35:41.647
So the purpose of political
science is not to stand above or

00:35:41.647 --> 00:35:47.389
outside the political community
as an entomologist observing the

00:35:47.389 --> 00:35:52.949
ant behavior but rather to serve
as a civic-minded arbiter and

00:35:52.949 --> 00:35:58.599
guardian of disputes in order to
restore peace and stability to

00:35:58.599 --> 00:36:03.798
conflict ridden situations.
We are in danger today of

00:36:03.798 --> 00:36:07.897
losing touch with those
questions and those insights

00:36:07.897 --> 00:36:12.960
that are the original motivation
for understanding politics.

00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:18.172
In place of these questions has
arisen a kind of narrow-minded

00:36:18.172 --> 00:36:22.957
focus on methodology often at
the expense of the life and

00:36:22.957 --> 00:36:28.170
death issues that make up the
substance of the political.

00:36:28.170 --> 00:36:32.065
So I end with this question.
Where should the study of

00:36:32.065 --> 00:36:36.160
political science be now?
You have sat through 13 weeks

00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:40.570
of an introductory course.
Where do you go from here?

00:36:40.570 --> 00:36:44.322
To ask a question posed
brilliantly by Karl Marx,

00:36:44.322 --> 00:36:47.840
he asked, "Who will educate the
educators?"

00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:52.656
the best question he ever asked.
How can we begin a

00:36:52.656 --> 00:36:58.679
comprehensive reeducation of
today's political science?

00:36:58.679 --> 00:37:04.432
The only answer and the best
answer I can give you today is

00:37:04.432 --> 00:37:10.231
simply to read old books.
These are our best teachers in

00:37:10.231 --> 00:37:15.329
a world where real teachers are
in short supply.

00:37:15.329 --> 00:37:19.865
In addition to what you have
read here, I would include front

00:37:19.865 --> 00:37:23.720
and center in your future
reading books like Plato's

00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:27.039
Laws,
Machiavelli's Discourses on

00:37:27.039 --> 00:37:30.976
Livy, and Montesquieu's
incomparable Spirit of the

00:37:30.976 --> 00:37:32.835
Laws,
and of course,

00:37:32.835 --> 00:37:37.076
The Federalist Papers.
To read these books in the

00:37:37.076 --> 00:37:40.971
spirit in which they were
written is to acquire an

00:37:40.971 --> 00:37:44.230
education in political
responsibility.

00:37:44.230 --> 00:37:47.132
This, of course,
or these should be supplemented

00:37:47.132 --> 00:37:50.653
by a study of the deeds and
writings of the most important

00:37:50.653 --> 00:37:53.000
American statesmen from
Jefferson,

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:56.909
Madison, Lincoln through Wilson
and Roosevelt.

00:37:56.909 --> 00:38:00.497
And these, in turn,
should be supported by the

00:38:00.497 --> 00:38:04.403
study of our leading
jurisprudential thinkers from

00:38:04.403 --> 00:38:08.230
Marshall, Holmes,
Brandeis, and Frankfurter.

00:38:08.230 --> 00:38:10.836
And finally,
this should be completed by an

00:38:10.836 --> 00:38:14.187
examination of the most
important statesmen and leaders

00:38:14.187 --> 00:38:16.980
from world history from around
the world,

00:38:16.980 --> 00:38:22.296
from Pericles to Churchill.
Once you have completed those

00:38:22.296 --> 00:38:26.297
readings, once you have done
that, and I would say only when

00:38:26.297 --> 00:38:30.468
you have done that,
can you say that you are living

00:38:30.468 --> 00:38:35.825
up to the highest offices of a
Yale student aptly summarized on

00:38:35.825 --> 00:38:41.010
the memorial gate outside of
Branford College which says,

00:38:41.010 --> 00:38:43.890
"For God, For Country,
and For Yale."

00:38:47.630 --> 00:38:56.151
Thank you for your time and
patience over this semester and

00:38:56.151 --> 00:38:58.284
good luck to you in the future.

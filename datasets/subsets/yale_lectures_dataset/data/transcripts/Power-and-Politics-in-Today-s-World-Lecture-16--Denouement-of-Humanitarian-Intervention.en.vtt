00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.023
- Good morning, everybody.

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:13.280
So today's lecture is called

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.770
The Denouement of
Humanitarian Intervention,

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.713
and it's mainly gonna be focused on Libya,

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:24.830
though we'll see, we'll look elsewhere

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:26.973
in the Arab Spring as well.

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:32.850
Let's start at the end, though.

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.363
This is Libya late last year.

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:49.080
- So that was the situation in late 2018.

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.200
If anything, it's worse today.

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.910
There was supposed to be elections held

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:56.720
which couldn't be held
because of the fighting

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:01.720
and Haftar has mounted
successive assaults on Tripoli,

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:04.980
and so the country is in a continuing

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:07.133
stalemate failed state.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.050
So that tells you what happened,

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:12.370
it didn't tell you anything
about why it happened

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:16.973
and what we should infer from
why it happened, and that's,

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:20.920
the way into today's agenda.

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:23.313
We're gonna ask how and why it happened,

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:26.540
and then we're gonna
look at the implications

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:30.140
for the prospects for
humanitarian intervention efforts

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:33.580
going forward, the
stability and future shape

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:37.090
of the Middle East, and
the ability of the US

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:39.550
to be a force for good internationally

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:44.380
and how that has been impacted by this,

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:47.330
what's happened over the last nine years

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:49.933
since we begun that action.

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:55.090
But let's begin by picking up
the thread of responsibility

00:06:55.090 --> 00:07:00.090
to protect that I lectured
about a couple of weeks ago.

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:02.980
And you'll remember that this was all

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:07.083
in the shadow of Rwanda, and then Kosovo.

00:07:08.174 --> 00:07:13.077
The NATO forces had
gone into Kosovo in 1999

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:19.270
without UN authorization

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:22.170
when no NATO country had been threatened,

00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:24.530
and this has produced
a lot of hand-wringing

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:27.570
in the international community that led

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:30.103
the Prime Minister of Sweden,

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:34.180
don't know by what
legitimacy he had to do this,

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:37.000
but he appointed an
international commission

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.870
which concluded that the NATO action

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:42.770
had been illegal but legitimate.

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:46.330
We had considerable debate
about what that might mean,

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:49.810
and they did at the time as well.

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:53.872
It was eventually
followed in 2005 at the UN

00:07:53.872 --> 00:07:55.960
by the adoption of something called

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:58.740
the UN World Summit Outcome Document

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:03.350
where they famously announced
that each individual state

00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:06.880
has a responsibility to
protect its populations

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:10.110
from genocide, war
crimes, ethnic cleansing,

00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:12.340
and crimes against humanity.

00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:16.880
They took it upon the UN
to be the enforcer of this

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:19.927
and said, "We are prepared
to take collective action

00:08:19.927 --> 00:08:21.967
"in a timely and decisive manner

00:08:21.967 --> 00:08:26.197
"through the Security Council
on a case-by-case basis,

00:08:26.197 --> 00:08:29.857
"and in cooperation with
relevant regional organizations

00:08:29.857 --> 00:08:32.920
"should other means be inadequate."

00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:37.129
And I pointed out that R2P had
a number of notable features,

00:08:37.129 --> 00:08:40.640
one that it was binding
not only on signatories,

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:45.333
but on non-signatories
as well, unlike the ICC.

00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:50.820
It's restricted to severe
human rights abuses,

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:53.520
genocide, crimes against
humanity, war crimes,

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:57.583
and ethnic cleansing even though
others had pushed for more.

00:08:58.650 --> 00:09:00.840
It was a big departure for the UN

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:04.520
because its focus on what
was going on within countries

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:08.210
seemed to live in considerable
tension, to put it mildly,

00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:12.600
with the UN's hardboiled
recognition of the independence

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:16.520
of countries and a remit
that was only about

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:19.380
in maintaining international
peace and security

00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:22.433
and not being concerned with
what went on within countries.

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:26.110
I pointed out that it was not binding

00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:28.008
on the Security Council.

00:09:28.008 --> 00:09:29.990
The responsibility to protect

00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:33.170
is the responsibility of
governments to protect

00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:35.330
populations under their control,

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:38.610
but it's not a responsibility
of the social security

00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:41.080
necessarily to intervene.

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:44.493
It gives wide latitude in a case-by-case,

00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:50.590
case-by-case basis, and
that the early opposition

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:53.433
of the non-aligned movement
and the grumbling in the

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:58.880
African Union was a
portent of things to come.

00:09:58.880 --> 00:09:59.930
And the things to come

00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:02.480
are what we're gonna
be talking about today.

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:04.890
I also mentioned some early tests

00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:07.373
in Sudan and Kenya and Guinea,

00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:12.550
once the idea of R2P had been adopted,

00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:17.020
and also in Libya, in February of 2011,

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:20.560
February 26th in particular,

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:23.900
this is after the outbreak
of the Arab Spring,

00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:28.900
and once the conflict
in Libya was under way,

00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:34.950
that first of all unanimously
referred Gaddafi to the ICC,

00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:37.810
the first time a Security
Council had done that,

00:10:37.810 --> 00:10:40.650
somewhat hypocritically as I said because

00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:44.950
countries like the US don't
recognize its jurisdiction

00:10:44.950 --> 00:10:46.560
over their own nationals,

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:48.710
but they were happy to
refer Gaddafi there.

00:10:50.410 --> 00:10:53.600
And they also mentioned the notion of

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:55.623
responsibility to protect.

00:10:56.810 --> 00:11:00.080
And they imposed an arms embargo sanctions

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:05.080
and urged that he'd be subject
to criminal prosecution,

00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:11.203
but the first real test was
actually the following month,

00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:16.962
when the UN substituted

00:11:16.962 --> 00:11:20.230
Security Council Resolution 1970

00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:24.140
with Security Council Resolution 1973,

00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:27.310
which we're gonna spend a
considerable bit of time on.

00:11:27.310 --> 00:11:30.690
But first, it's very
important to get some grip

00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:34.440
of what was actually going
on in the Arab Spring,

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:37.970
because it was widely
misinterpreted at the time

00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:40.580
particularly in major countries,

00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:43.840
and the conventional wisdom
about what was going on

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:47.040
turned out to be wildly wrong.

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:50.470
So let me just give you a snippet
of the conventional wisdom

00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:52.763
and then we'll see what
was really going on.

00:11:54.770 --> 00:11:57.220
- While the uprising across the
Middle East and North Africa

00:11:57.220 --> 00:12:00.010
did not take place during
a specific calendar season,

00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:03.150
they were commonly referred
to as the Arab Spring,

00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:05.773
an allusion to the so
called Prague Spring,

00:12:05.773 --> 00:12:09.942
a 1968 democratic revolution
in Czechoslovakia.

00:12:09.942 --> 00:12:13.820
(uptempo drum music)

00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:16.540
The Arab Spring timeline began in Tunisia,

00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:18.640
a country that had been
under the allegedly corrupt

00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:22.380
and authoritarian rule of
President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali

00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:24.220
for more than two decades.

00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:28.150
On December 17th, 2010,
a working class vendor

00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:30.330
named Mohamed Bouazizi was approached

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:33.940
by Tunisian authorities
about his unlicensed cart.

00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:35.400
He offered to pay a fine,

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:37.490
but instead, his vegetables
were confiscated,

00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:40.260
and he was publicly
humiliated by the police.

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.487
In a short protest,
Bouazizi stood in front of

00:12:42.487 --> 00:12:46.670
the local governor's office
and set himself on fire.

00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:49.223
He died from his injuries on January 4th.

00:12:51.289 --> 00:12:54.680
(dramatic music)

00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:57.300
Bouazizi became a martyr
who inspired others

00:12:57.300 --> 00:12:58.680
who were suffering from unemployment

00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:00.680
at the hands of a corrupt government.

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:03.166
His death sparked a Tunisian revolution

00:13:03.166 --> 00:13:06.390
in which protesters armed
themselves not only with signs,

00:13:06.390 --> 00:13:09.400
but with cell phones,
allowing the protests

00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:12.390
to spread at social media speed.

00:13:12.390 --> 00:13:15.620
On January 11th, the week
after Bouazizi's death,

00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:17.490
Tunisia's government fell apart,

00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:21.113
and the disgraced President
Ben Ali fled the country.

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:24.010
The videos of the successful uprising

00:13:24.010 --> 00:13:26.760
shared via social media
raise global awareness

00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:28.680
of the protests themselves.

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:32.046
State-run news organizations
were barely able to keep up.

00:13:32.046 --> 00:13:34.320
The speed and success of the protests

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:36.370
inspired others across the region.

00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:38.875
Throughout January,
protests erupted in Algeria,

00:13:38.875 --> 00:13:41.140
Jordan and Oman.

00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:44.560
By January 25th, the
movement reached Egypt,

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:48.230
followed by Syria, Yemen, Iraq, Libya,

00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:49.973
and several other countries.

00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:53.950
On February 11th, the Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak

00:13:53.950 --> 00:13:56.830
stepped down, and by the end of the year,

00:13:56.830 --> 00:13:58.843
Yemen's government was overthrown.

00:13:59.881 --> 00:14:01.920
(people chanting)

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:04.740
As was Libya's, ending the dictatorship

00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:07.607
and the life of their
leader Muammar Gaddafi,

00:14:07.607 --> 00:14:11.143
who was captured and killed
by Libyan rebel militia.

00:14:13.170 --> 00:14:16.380
- So that's the conventional
reading of each of the

00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:20.402
Arab Spring that it erupted in Tunisia

00:14:20.402 --> 00:14:23.850
and then just basically
spread like wildfire

00:14:23.850 --> 00:14:25.800
across the Middle East and North Africa,

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:29.240
and it's one of the reasons
there was so much enthusiasm

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:30.943
for it in the West.

00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:33.940
But it was a fundamental misreading,

00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:37.610
and just to give you one
very important illustration

00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:39.710
that bears on what's coming next,

00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:44.050
it was a misreading of
what was going on in Egypt.

00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:48.030
Now everybody could remember
at the turn of 2011,

00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:51.700
the eruption of protests
in Tahrir Square in Cairo,

00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:55.130
millions and millions of
protesters, supporters.

00:14:55.130 --> 00:14:56.880
It started out peacefully,

00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:59.992
and then supporters of the Mubarak regime

00:14:59.992 --> 00:15:02.230
became involved in conflicts

00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:05.070
with the opponents of the regime,

00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:08.090
and they were largely
middle class secular people.

00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:10.930
We tend to, we now with hindsight,

00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:12.527
we think about Morsi's

00:15:16.070 --> 00:15:19.130
Muslim Brotherhood
government being overthrown

00:15:19.130 --> 00:15:24.130
two years later, but at
the time of the eruption,

00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:28.870
it was largely a secular
opposition movement

00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:33.830
opposed to Mubarak,
calling for regime change.

00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:36.450
And I'll just show you
a couple of videos there

00:15:36.450 --> 00:15:40.523
that start to give a hint of
how the conventional reading,

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:44.963
conventional wisdom was was misleading.

00:15:44.963 --> 00:15:47.796
(people chanting)

00:16:00.657 --> 00:16:04.907
(men speaking in foreign language)

00:16:13.051 --> 00:16:18.051
(people speaking in foreign
language and whistling)

00:16:29.219 --> 00:16:32.052
(people chanting)

00:17:10.087 --> 00:17:14.254
(man singing in foreign language)

00:17:23.658 --> 00:17:26.557
- So what was unusual there is,

00:17:26.557 --> 00:17:29.830
and if I played more,
you'd see even more of it,

00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:31.510
is that from the beginning,

00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:36.110
the military were very supportive
of these demonstrations

00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:38.490
that were going on in Tahrir Square,

00:17:38.490 --> 00:17:41.330
and indeed as time went
on, it became clear

00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:45.280
that the military was
behind the regime change.

00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:46.400
- [Matt] President Hosni Mubarak

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:48.592
will meet the demands of protestors,

00:17:48.592 --> 00:17:51.595
military and ruling party
officials said Thursday.

00:17:51.595 --> 00:17:53.430
It's the strongest indication yet

00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:55.138
that Egypt's longtime president

00:17:55.138 --> 00:17:56.727
may be about to give up power

00:17:56.727 --> 00:17:59.294
and that the armed forces
were seizing control.

00:17:59.294 --> 00:18:01.802
A military commander told
thousand of protestors

00:18:01.802 --> 00:18:03.128
in Central Tahrir Square,

00:18:03.128 --> 00:18:05.262
"All your demands will be met today."

00:18:05.262 --> 00:18:06.632
Some in the crowd held up their hands

00:18:06.632 --> 00:18:09.719
in V for victory signs,
shouting, "God is great."

00:18:09.719 --> 00:18:12.057
The military's supreme
council was meeting Thursday

00:18:12.057 --> 00:18:14.210
without the Commander in Chief Mubarak,

00:18:14.210 --> 00:18:16.227
and announced on state TV its support

00:18:16.227 --> 00:18:18.411
of the legitimate demands of the people.

00:18:18.411 --> 00:18:20.418
A spokesman read a
statement that the council

00:18:20.418 --> 00:18:22.631
was in permanent session to explore

00:18:22.631 --> 00:18:24.497
what measures and
arrangements could be made

00:18:24.497 --> 00:18:26.889
to safeguard the nation, its achievements,

00:18:26.889 --> 00:18:28.957
and the ambitions of its great people.

00:18:28.957 --> 00:18:31.200
The head of the ruling party
told the Associated Press

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:33.526
that he expects Mubarak will
address the people tonight

00:18:33.526 --> 00:18:36.280
to respond to protesters' demands.

00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:38.483
Matt Friedman, The Associated Press.

00:18:44.784 --> 00:18:47.362
- Either this is the first Arab revolution

00:18:47.362 --> 00:18:48.729
of the 21st century,

00:18:48.729 --> 00:18:51.032
either this is the first Arab revolution

00:18:51.032 --> 00:18:51.865
of the 21st century, or it
will be brutally suppressed.

00:18:55.757 --> 00:18:57.688
- [Reporter] Tense new
beginnings for Tunisia,

00:18:57.688 --> 00:18:58.747
its Arab neighbors nervous
of how revolutionary feelings

00:19:01.563 --> 00:19:02.815
could spread.

00:19:02.815 --> 00:19:06.331
Mubarak's deposed,
Egypt's 18 day revolution

00:19:06.331 --> 00:19:08.060
defies all expectation.

00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:11.670
- Rarely can a military
takeover have been greeted

00:19:11.670 --> 00:19:14.533
with such enthusiasm,
as it is on the streets

00:19:14.533 --> 00:19:16.033
of Cairo tonight.

00:19:17.854 --> 00:19:21.340
- So there again, you see
this enormous enthusiasm

00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:23.420
for this military takeover,

00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:25.663
which then promised elections.

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:29.834
And in the elections,

00:19:29.834 --> 00:19:34.440
initially, the Muslim
Brotherhood was not going to run.

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:35.940
They said they would not run because

00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:39.420
they were the only organized
political party in Egypt,

00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:41.260
and there was a general perception

00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:44.590
it would be unfair for them to have

00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:46.270
such a big head start,

00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:48.250
but they soon changed their mind

00:19:48.250 --> 00:19:53.250
and the military allowed them
to run, and Morsi easily won.

00:19:53.450 --> 00:19:57.770
But the puzzle is why
did the Egyptian military

00:19:57.770 --> 00:20:00.740
get behind this revolution?

00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:03.093
It's not what the military typically does.

00:20:03.970 --> 00:20:07.420
Mubarak had a long history of association

00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:09.110
with the military.

00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:14.110
And so this really is a corruption story

00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:18.237
spelled out in Sarah Chayes'
book "Thieves of State:

00:20:18.237 --> 00:20:21.547
"Why Corruption Threatens
Global Security".

00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:25.760
That book is principally about Afghanistan

00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:27.730
where she spent 10 years,

00:20:27.730 --> 00:20:31.100
and for her main thesis in the book,

00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:32.900
which is sort of orthogonal to what

00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:35.620
we're doing here today,
but I'll just mention it,

00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:39.670
her main thesis is that
insurgent movements

00:20:39.670 --> 00:20:42.880
are fed by corruption,
that people on the ground,

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:45.260
citizenrys hate corruption,

00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:50.260
and if insurgent movements
promised to get rid of corruption

00:20:50.450 --> 00:20:52.010
the people will support them.

00:20:52.010 --> 00:20:55.140
And she had been trying to
convince Petraeus, McChrystal

00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:59.010
and others that any effective
counterinsurgency movement

00:20:59.010 --> 00:21:01.890
in Afghanistan would
have to focus centrally

00:21:01.890 --> 00:21:03.660
on getting rid of corruption

00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:07.850
if it was ever gonna get
anywhere, and she eventually got,

00:21:07.850 --> 00:21:09.240
had some headway.

00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:12.460
But her chapter about Egypt
tells a somewhat different

00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:14.570
and more interesting story in some ways

00:21:14.570 --> 00:21:17.690
which is that the Egyptian military

00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:23.710
had a long history of being involved

00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:27.320
in a certain kind of
corruption with a difference.

00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:29.623
So if you go back to 1970,

00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:36.170
the 1967 and '73 wars against Israel,

00:21:36.170 --> 00:21:39.010
the Egyptian military
had been badly humiliated

00:21:39.010 --> 00:21:44.010
by being defeated by the
Israelis, and as a result of that,

00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:50.360
they partly blamed the
inept Egyptian state

00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:54.180
and its inability to deliver the things

00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:55.860
that the military needed.

00:21:55.860 --> 00:21:58.573
So they decided to essentially,

00:21:59.790 --> 00:22:02.790
you might call it, sort of go rogue,

00:22:02.790 --> 00:22:05.510
and they created their own second economy

00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:09.940
to create all of their own
supply lines for the military.

00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:13.010
And the thought was that never again

00:22:13.010 --> 00:22:16.590
was the military gonna be
under-resourced and under-prepared

00:22:16.590 --> 00:22:18.900
in a future war.

00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:20.417
But as things go,

00:22:20.417 --> 00:22:24.030
and you get mission creep
in all matters in life,

00:22:24.030 --> 00:22:26.730
they then discovered,
many of these generals,

00:22:26.730 --> 00:22:28.930
that they could actually
make a lot of money

00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:34.570
in this second economy,
and so it became a lot of

00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:38.510
essentially a kind of black market economy

00:22:38.510 --> 00:22:41.360
through which these generals became rich.

00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:45.400
However, they were
fairly discreet about it,

00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:49.500
they didn't flaunt their wealth very much

00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:54.500
and they didn't outrage
the population that much.

00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:59.600
However, what happens in
the heyday of neoliberalism

00:23:00.770 --> 00:23:04.870
and the Washington Consensus
is that other Egyptian elites

00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:09.540
also decide to get rich, and
particularly Mubarak's son,

00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:12.880
Gamal Mubarak was a sort of London playboy

00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:16.030
with lots of fancy cars,
and he and his friends

00:23:16.030 --> 00:23:19.083
came back to Egypt and they,

00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:23.440
they did flaunt their wealth,

00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:26.980
and so they had the Lamborghinis
driving around Cairo

00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:30.530
and the playboy clubs
and all the rest of this,

00:23:30.530 --> 00:23:33.500
and this partly outraged the military

00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:37.480
and also made the military worried

00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:40.750
that there was gonna be a reaction against

00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:42.900
this kind of corruption.

00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:47.900
So they got behind the coup,

00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:51.320
behind the Arab Spring
because they really,

00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:56.320
they wanted to get rid
of the Mubarak regime.

00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:59.440
And furthermore, they
were very happy for Morsi

00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:03.230
to be elected because in their view,

00:24:03.230 --> 00:24:07.380
he would be the agent of
cleansing the old regime,

00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:10.900
and they would be able to
keep their hands clean,

00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:13.692
which he then did because Morsi ran,

00:24:13.692 --> 00:24:17.790
he played the typical
Sarah Chayes playbook,

00:24:17.790 --> 00:24:21.350
he ran as being a cleaner up of corruption

00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:22.543
who would get rid of,

00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:26.690
who would drain the swamp, so to speak.

00:24:26.690 --> 00:24:31.080
And he set about doing that,
going after the old regime,

00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:36.000
and indeed, Mubarak and his children were

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:40.150
convicted of various corruption
charges and were in and out,

00:24:40.150 --> 00:24:42.482
and the sons were in and out of prison

00:24:42.482 --> 00:24:45.970
for many of the next several years.

00:24:45.970 --> 00:24:48.840
But once Mubarak had done,

00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:50.820
once Morsi had done that,

00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:52.900
the military had no more use for him.

00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:57.900
And so when people came
dissatisfied with him,

00:24:58.670 --> 00:25:01.710
they had no problem getting rid of him,

00:25:01.710 --> 00:25:06.710
and General Sisi took over and
recreated a military regime,

00:25:07.870 --> 00:25:11.330
and that's what we've had
for the last several years.

00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:14.300
So there was a popular uprising,

00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:18.440
but people misunderstood
what was really going on,

00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:22.610
which was essentially the
military ridding themselves

00:25:22.610 --> 00:25:26.560
of liabilities and consolidating a regime

00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:28.633
over a couple of years.

00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:34.070
And so that was one form of
misreading what was going on

00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:35.850
in the Arab Spring.

00:25:35.850 --> 00:25:40.420
Another form is what happened in Libya,

00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:44.073
as we could also tell much
of the same story for Yemen,

00:25:45.650 --> 00:25:50.040
which is that people
widely mistook a civil war

00:25:52.390 --> 00:25:57.390
for a revolution, a civil
war for a popular uprising.

00:25:58.150 --> 00:26:03.150
So the Security Council Resolution

00:26:03.410 --> 00:26:05.913
that was adopted in March,

00:26:08.750 --> 00:26:12.970
1973, you can see it
was voted 10 yes, no no,

00:26:12.970 --> 00:26:17.970
with five abstentions, and
so nobody had opposed it

00:26:18.530 --> 00:26:22.950
whereas the one three weeks
earlier had been unanimous.

00:26:22.950 --> 00:26:25.250
And it established no-fly zones,

00:26:25.250 --> 00:26:28.850
this is when violence had erupted.

00:26:28.850 --> 00:26:32.230
It excluded the introduction
of foreign ground forces.

00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:35.100
It authorized member
states acting nationally

00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:37.810
or through regional
organizations or arrangements

00:26:37.810 --> 00:26:41.490
to take all necessary
measures to protect civilians

00:26:41.490 --> 00:26:45.400
and civilian populations
under threat of attack.

00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:50.220
And it created an exception
to the resolution it passed

00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:54.200
three weeks earlier, so that,

00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:57.400
which had imposed an arms embargo

00:26:57.400 --> 00:27:02.400
in order to enable the UN supported forces

00:27:03.036 --> 00:27:05.640
to arm the rebels.

00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:09.530
And so that was a signal
of what was to come.

00:27:09.530 --> 00:27:14.530
So here you had, in February 26,

00:27:14.790 --> 00:27:18.152
you had a resolution passed,
including an arms embargo,

00:27:18.152 --> 00:27:22.910
three weeks later, you
have a modification of that

00:27:22.910 --> 00:27:26.280
and a much more
aggressively interventionist

00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:30.100
but still containment-oriented regime.

00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:34.270
So one question is, well, what happened?

00:27:34.270 --> 00:27:35.103
Why?

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:40.833
Why did the UN authorize these
new actions in three weeks?

00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:49.513
And here's a clue to that action.

00:27:51.180 --> 00:27:53.493
Notice the dates on these documents.

00:27:54.810 --> 00:27:57.297
The Resolution 1970

00:28:00.427 --> 00:28:02.923
had been passed on February 26th,

00:28:04.010 --> 00:28:07.080
on March 10th, so this is a week later,

00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:11.010
a week before, two weeks
later, a week before

00:28:11.010 --> 00:28:13.800
the new resolution's gonna go ahead,

00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:15.983
you could read this in the New York Times,

00:28:16.817 --> 00:28:19.457
"Moving ahead of its
allies, France on Thursday

00:28:19.457 --> 00:28:21.597
"became the first country to recognize

00:28:21.597 --> 00:28:26.047
"Libya's rebel leadership in
the eastern city of Benghazi

00:28:26.047 --> 00:28:28.737
"and said it would soon
exchange ambassadors

00:28:28.737 --> 00:28:30.337
"with the insurgents.

00:28:30.337 --> 00:28:33.297
"The move was a victory for
the Libyan National Council

00:28:33.297 --> 00:28:36.827
"in its quest for recognition
and a setback for Gaddafi

00:28:36.827 --> 00:28:39.567
"who had been seeking
whatever international support

00:28:39.567 --> 00:28:42.587
"he could for as NATO members in Brussels

00:28:42.587 --> 00:28:46.267
"had begun debating the
possibility of imposing

00:28:46.267 --> 00:28:47.837
"a no-fly zone.

00:28:47.837 --> 00:28:51.970
"The French announcement came
as loyalist forces in Libya

00:28:53.787 --> 00:28:56.427
"claimed new successes against the rebels

00:28:56.427 --> 00:28:59.347
"west of the capital, while in the east,

00:28:59.347 --> 00:29:02.510
"loyalist forces renewed
ferocious attacks,"

00:29:02.510 --> 00:29:05.410
on several towns actually.

00:29:05.410 --> 00:29:10.090
So what this paragraph is concealing

00:29:10.090 --> 00:29:12.750
or not telling you is that when

00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:16.270
the first resolution had passed,

00:29:16.270 --> 00:29:19.520
it looked like Gaddafi was basically done.

00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:22.780
It looked, he had lost
control of all of the cities,

00:29:22.780 --> 00:29:25.940
and as a result of that,

00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:28.280
it looked like his days were numbered.

00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:31.550
Most people thought the
regime was crumbling.

00:29:31.550 --> 00:29:34.710
And the French and the
British and the Italians

00:29:34.710 --> 00:29:39.020
had big oil interests and
good relations with Gaddafi.

00:29:39.020 --> 00:29:40.843
Gaddafi, we forget,

00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:45.700
in the first decade of the
21st century had sort of,

00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:48.650
internationally speaking,
come in from the cold.

00:29:48.650 --> 00:29:53.650
He had given up the
Lockerbie bombers for trial,

00:29:53.810 --> 00:29:57.610
he had agreed to dismantle
his nuclear program,

00:29:57.610 --> 00:29:59.610
which he subsequently did,

00:29:59.610 --> 00:30:03.850
he helped with intelligence
against Afghanistan

00:30:03.850 --> 00:30:06.750
in the aftermath of 9/11,

00:30:06.750 --> 00:30:11.350
and actually also, his domestic
atrocities had diminished.

00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:14.170
If you look at most of the
human rights violations

00:30:14.170 --> 00:30:18.120
he's accused of, they're all
before the turn of the century.

00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:20.200
Didn't mean he'd become a nice guy,

00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:24.440
but he was a pretty run-of-the-mill
Middle Eastern dictator

00:30:27.962 --> 00:30:31.703
not as nasty as he had been in the 1990s.

00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:36.210
But now it looked like he was done,

00:30:36.210 --> 00:30:39.228
and so the question is
what was gonna happen

00:30:39.228 --> 00:30:42.760
to the oil relationships?

00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:46.160
And so the French decided
they better make nice

00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:48.500
with who's gonna be the new government,

00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:51.620
and so they started conversations,

00:30:51.620 --> 00:30:55.750
and these were brokered by a
French political philosopher

00:30:55.750 --> 00:30:58.910
by the name of Bernard-Henri Levy

00:30:58.910 --> 00:31:01.420
shows you why you should never
let political philosophers

00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:04.900
have too much influence in politics,

00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:08.820
and he started brokering meetings between

00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:11.940
the opposition groups and
the French government,

00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:13.890
Sarkozy's government.

00:31:13.890 --> 00:31:15.665
He was essentially telling them,

00:31:15.665 --> 00:31:19.030
"This is the government
that's taking over,"

00:31:19.030 --> 00:31:24.030
but after the first resolution had passed,

00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:27.730
the reality on the ground changed,

00:31:27.730 --> 00:31:30.090
and Gaddafi started winning again,

00:31:30.090 --> 00:31:34.080
and so they were then in
trouble because they had said

00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:38.020
on March 10th that France
recognized the Council

00:31:38.020 --> 00:31:41.560
as a sole legitimate
representative the Libyan people,

00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:44.860
it put France ahead of
other European powers

00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:47.560
that had been seeking ways
of supporting the rebels

00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:49.370
on toppling Gaddafi,

00:31:49.370 --> 00:31:51.720
normally European countries don't do that,

00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:54.050
so their aggressive
stance was seen as a way

00:31:54.050 --> 00:31:56.460
of showing commitment
to the popular uprising,

00:31:56.460 --> 00:31:59.320
so they said, but what
they were really doing

00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:02.110
was showing a commitment
to the what they thought

00:32:02.110 --> 00:32:04.830
was the emerging government of Libya.

00:32:04.830 --> 00:32:09.030
And you can see here how they spun it,

00:32:09.030 --> 00:32:12.040
the day that the resolution was passed.

00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:16.163
The resolution, allegedly
just about containment,

00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:20.600
passed a week after France
had already recognized

00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:23.893
the opposition as the
legitimate government of Libya.

00:32:24.990 --> 00:32:27.630
- [Tim] After being accused
of being slow to react

00:32:27.630 --> 00:32:30.370
to the revolutions in Tunisia and Egypt,

00:32:30.370 --> 00:32:32.560
the French president has moved quickly

00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:36.160
to silence his critics and
take the lead in reprisals

00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:38.260
against Colonel Gaddafi.

00:32:38.260 --> 00:32:41.860
Meeting representatives of the
rebels at the Elysee Palace,

00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:45.546
he promised them immediate
diplomatic recognition.

00:32:45.546 --> 00:32:48.170
(speaking foreign language)

00:32:48.170 --> 00:32:49.970
- [Interpreter] France has
expressed its satisfaction

00:32:49.970 --> 00:32:52.637
about the creation of the Libyan
National Transition Council

00:32:52.637 --> 00:32:54.742
and after this meeting
with President Sarkozy,

00:32:54.742 --> 00:32:56.580
I can say that France has recognized

00:32:56.580 --> 00:32:57.810
the Transitional National Council

00:32:57.810 --> 00:33:01.760
as the legitimate representation
of the Libyan people.

00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:03.980
- The French plan is reported to include

00:33:03.980 --> 00:33:08.190
proposing limited airstrikes
against key Gaddafi targets,

00:33:08.190 --> 00:33:12.160
such as his headquarters
and a military airbase.

00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:14.540
There was no official confirmation

00:33:14.540 --> 00:33:16.720
from President Sarkozy's office,

00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:19.610
and it's a highly controversial proposal

00:33:19.610 --> 00:33:21.850
that would meet with strong resistance

00:33:21.850 --> 00:33:24.260
from many European allies,

00:33:24.260 --> 00:33:28.300
who are also wary of giving
the rebel representatives

00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:31.464
diplomatic recognition at this stage.

00:33:31.464 --> 00:33:33.410
(speaking foreign language)

00:33:33.410 --> 00:33:35.650
- [Interpreter] That's a
decision by a single government.

00:33:35.650 --> 00:33:37.590
I think it's better for
us to listen to the stance

00:33:37.590 --> 00:33:39.373
of the entire European community.

00:33:41.030 --> 00:33:43.770
- [Tim] The Elysee Palace
says that Mr. Sarkozy

00:33:43.770 --> 00:33:45.630
is seeking legal authority

00:33:45.630 --> 00:33:48.380
to prevent the use of force by Gaddafi.

00:33:48.380 --> 00:33:51.150
It believes that jamming
his communications

00:33:51.150 --> 00:33:53.090
would be a good start.

00:33:53.090 --> 00:33:55.813
Tim Friend, Al Jazeera, Paris.

00:33:56.890 --> 00:33:58.600
- So there was, they were now,

00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:00.340
they were in a difficult spot

00:34:00.340 --> 00:34:03.320
because they had
recognized the opposition,

00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:05.650
but Gaddafi was now once
again winning the war

00:34:05.650 --> 00:34:08.510
and he was regaining
control of the cities,

00:34:08.510 --> 00:34:12.400
and he was indeed about to
regain control of Benghazi,

00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:16.950
and so what the French did was that they

00:34:18.470 --> 00:34:23.470
pushed very hard to
get a resolution passed

00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:26.120
that would allow them to depose Gaddafi

00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:28.340
because they realized that they had

00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:31.580
burned their bridges with him,

00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:35.450
and essentially, that
had become their agenda.

00:34:35.450 --> 00:34:39.350
And right after the resolution passed,

00:34:39.350 --> 00:34:43.610
they began massive bombing
almost immediately,

00:34:43.610 --> 00:34:46.180
so much so that the Arab League,

00:34:46.180 --> 00:34:49.888
you can see here, the next
day the resolution passed

00:34:49.888 --> 00:34:53.585
three days later, passed on the 17th,

00:34:53.585 --> 00:34:58.200
the Arab League was furious
as was the African Union

00:34:58.200 --> 00:35:01.200
who had gone along with this,

00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:05.530
and African Union countries
on the Security Council

00:35:05.530 --> 00:35:07.360
had even voted for it,

00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:12.180
and they saw that there was
a much more aggressive agenda

00:35:12.180 --> 00:35:16.550
going on and it was really
about getting rid of the regime.

00:35:16.550 --> 00:35:19.850
And indeed, a lot of reports,

00:35:19.850 --> 00:35:23.190
and I've given you the
jot and tittle of this

00:35:23.190 --> 00:35:27.330
in the reading for today,
a lot of the report,

00:35:27.330 --> 00:35:28.900
or the reading for two weeks ago,

00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:32.570
a lot of the reports about
imminent slaughter of civilians

00:35:32.570 --> 00:35:37.190
in Benghazi turned out to be
what we call fake news today,

00:35:37.190 --> 00:35:40.810
and there were very, first
of all, very few fatalities

00:35:40.810 --> 00:35:43.480
in the retaking of these cities,

00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:46.410
and almost no civilians were killed.

00:35:46.410 --> 00:35:51.380
Nonetheless, the hype for the
intervention was cranked up

00:35:51.380 --> 00:35:56.220
on the grounds that Gaddafi
was about to slaughter

00:35:56.220 --> 00:35:59.800
hundreds of thousands of
civilians in Benghazi.

00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:02.750
But I said at the outset that this,

00:36:02.750 --> 00:36:07.080
that everybody in the
West who was treating this

00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:10.890
as an Arab Spring
revolution were misreading

00:36:10.890 --> 00:36:13.263
that this was really a civil war.

00:36:14.170 --> 00:36:17.630
And the smoking gun comes
when you start to look at

00:36:17.630 --> 00:36:21.070
what was going on in the
Obama administration,

00:36:21.070 --> 00:36:25.470
because after all, Obama had run against,

00:36:25.470 --> 00:36:27.420
against endless wars.

00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:29.430
Obama had said that the, yes,

00:36:29.430 --> 00:36:31.920
Afghanistan had been a war of necessity,

00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:34.890
but the Iraq invasion
had been a war of choice.

00:36:34.890 --> 00:36:37.920
Unlike Hillary Clinton and unlike Kerry,

00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:40.403
he had not supported it in 2003,

00:36:41.312 --> 00:36:44.079
and he said America
should not get involved

00:36:44.079 --> 00:36:47.170
in these sorts of conflicts.

00:36:47.170 --> 00:36:51.020
And so who in the
administration was against it?

00:36:51.020 --> 00:36:55.990
Well, we'll see that in a second,

00:36:55.990 --> 00:36:59.570
but here's the smoking gun
that it was a civil war,

00:36:59.570 --> 00:37:02.300
who was leading the revolution?

00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:05.180
One is that Abdul Jalil

00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:08.390
was Gaddafi's former Justice Minister,

00:37:08.390 --> 00:37:12.073
Ali Aziz, Gaddafi's former
Ambassador to India,

00:37:13.132 --> 00:37:16.640
Mahmoud Jebril, his former
top economic advisor

00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:19.933
who was closely linked to
the oil multinationals,

00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:24.864
and the leaders of the so-called
Rebel Revolutionary Council

00:37:24.864 --> 00:37:29.500
included Abdul Younis who,
in the battle of Benghazi,

00:37:29.500 --> 00:37:32.100
had actually been on the
government's side initially

00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:33.670
and switched sides,

00:37:33.670 --> 00:37:38.670
and Omar Hariri, who had
no democratic credentials.

00:37:39.750 --> 00:37:43.617
Both of them had long
histories dating back to 1969

00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:49.120
of repressing democratic movements.

00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:51.523
So what happened here, what happened?

00:37:53.027 --> 00:37:55.220
As I said first of all,
February and March,

00:37:55.220 --> 00:37:58.510
from February to March,
things changed on the ground,

00:37:58.510 --> 00:38:00.850
and Gaddafi now had the upper hand,

00:38:00.850 --> 00:38:03.300
and the British and especially the French

00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:06.220
persuade Hillary Clinton and then Obama

00:38:06.220 --> 00:38:08.403
to get behind the,

00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:15.160
to get behind the resolution and go in.

00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:17.500
But so who was against it?

00:38:17.500 --> 00:38:19.620
First of all, Robert Gates was against it,

00:38:19.620 --> 00:38:23.160
then Secretary of Defense,
he had been appointed by Bush

00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:24.994
Obama had kept him on.

00:38:24.994 --> 00:38:27.860
If you read Gates' autobiography,

00:38:27.860 --> 00:38:32.210
he says the only reason
he didn't resign over this

00:38:32.210 --> 00:38:34.783
was that he was about,
he was three weeks away

00:38:34.783 --> 00:38:39.000
from retirement or four
weeks away from retirement,

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:42.383
but he said to Obama, "Why in
the world would you do this?

00:38:43.218 --> 00:38:47.157
"We're already involved in two
quagmires in the Middle East,

00:38:47.157 --> 00:38:49.610
"why get into a third one?"

00:38:49.610 --> 00:38:52.520
Joe Biden, Vice President, was against it,

00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:56.057
Mike Mullen the Chairman of the
Joint Chiefs was against it,

00:38:56.057 --> 00:38:59.590
Tom Donilon, the National
Security Advisor was against it,

00:38:59.590 --> 00:39:02.823
the Chief of Staff, Bill
Daley was against it,

00:39:04.167 --> 00:39:07.930
and the Deputy National Security
Advisors were against it.

00:39:07.930 --> 00:39:09.540
Who was in favor of it?

00:39:09.540 --> 00:39:12.130
Susan Rice, the Ambassador to UN,

00:39:12.130 --> 00:39:15.840
Samantha Power, a big
advocate of responsibility

00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:18.860
to protect and print
and had been appointed

00:39:18.860 --> 00:39:21.763
as a Special Assistant for Human Rights,

00:39:22.620 --> 00:39:26.240
Bed Rhodes, a Deputy
Advisor in the White House,

00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:31.090
and Hillary Clinton as
well became convinced.

00:39:31.090 --> 00:39:36.090
And this is how we got to the
phrase leading from behind,

00:39:36.570 --> 00:39:41.570
which Obama was subsequently tied with.

00:39:43.290 --> 00:39:44.800
As best I can reconstruct,

00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:47.210
although he did go on to
the Jay Leno show later

00:39:47.210 --> 00:39:49.290
and say he never used the phrase,

00:39:49.290 --> 00:39:51.330
but basically what happened was that

00:39:51.330 --> 00:39:54.170
Hillary Clinton had been skeptical,

00:39:54.170 --> 00:39:59.170
and she was in Paris for the
G7, and the French philosopher

00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:04.640
arranged meetings between her and Jebril,

00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:08.850
and they persuaded her
that they were indeed

00:40:08.850 --> 00:40:13.660
going to overthrow the
regime and install democracy.

00:40:13.660 --> 00:40:16.440
Even though none of them
had the slightest history

00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:19.940
of democratic behavior,
and so there was no reason

00:40:19.940 --> 00:40:23.793
to believe that they
would in fact do that.

00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:26.830
So she came back from the,

00:40:26.830 --> 00:40:29.403
I guess it was the G8 at that point,

00:40:30.490 --> 00:40:34.150
and she said to Obama, "I
think we should do this,"

00:40:34.150 --> 00:40:36.620
and he opposed it and
they argued about it,

00:40:36.620 --> 00:40:41.347
and eventually he said, "Well,
it's 51-49," and she said,

00:40:41.347 --> 00:40:43.067
"Well, the French really want to do this,

00:40:43.067 --> 00:40:47.300
"the Italians are on board," and so on.

00:40:47.300 --> 00:40:48.987
And he basically, he said,

00:40:48.987 --> 00:40:52.437
and this is why the French
started bombing early, he said,

00:40:52.437 --> 00:40:55.307
"Well basically, all right,
but it's got to be their show.

00:40:55.307 --> 00:40:58.107
"We're gonna be leading from behind."

00:41:00.150 --> 00:41:05.150
So what quickly happened though

00:41:05.530 --> 00:41:09.920
was that NATO expanded its remit,

00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:14.770
and the evidence of this is that

00:41:16.290 --> 00:41:18.930
once the African Union and the Arab League

00:41:18.930 --> 00:41:22.067
saw what was going on,
they said, "Now we can,

00:41:22.067 --> 00:41:25.117
"the crisis in Benghazi is over,

00:41:25.117 --> 00:41:27.077
"civilians are not being slaughtered,

00:41:27.077 --> 00:41:31.107
"we can now arrange a ceasefire
between Gaddafi's forces

00:41:31.107 --> 00:41:34.200
"and the opposition and
mediate this conflict."

00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:39.117
And instead, the NATO
forces said, "No, no, no,

00:41:39.117 --> 00:41:41.070
"we're gonna knock off Gaddafi."

00:41:41.070 --> 00:41:42.840
Now they couldn't put in ground troops,

00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:45.570
but they massively supplied the rebels

00:41:45.570 --> 00:41:47.510
until they were successful.

00:41:47.510 --> 00:41:51.617
It took about eight months until Gaddafi

00:41:52.910 --> 00:41:54.710
was finally killed and captured.

00:41:54.710 --> 00:41:59.017
The death toll was somewhere
between 2,500 and 25,000,

00:42:01.220 --> 00:42:05.883
I've seen estimates, probably about 8,000.

00:42:08.330 --> 00:42:13.130
And they nakedly pursued
regime change, and that,

00:42:13.130 --> 00:42:17.060
but nobody was portraying this
at the time as a civil war,

00:42:17.060 --> 00:42:21.240
they were still arguing that
this was a popular uprising

00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:22.920
and there was a democratic opposition

00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:25.300
and this was all gonna be great.

00:42:25.300 --> 00:42:27.123
So again, you can see the hype.

00:42:28.030 --> 00:42:30.040
- The Libyans I met didn't believe it.

00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:32.180
They said, "No, it can't be true."

00:42:32.180 --> 00:42:33.167
Many of them said,

00:42:33.167 --> 00:42:35.850
"This is something we
have been dreaming of."

00:42:35.850 --> 00:42:38.100
- [Reporter] As he's aged,
Muammar Gaddafi's style

00:42:38.100 --> 00:42:41.340
and his rhetoric had looked
more and more anachronistic.

00:42:41.340 --> 00:42:46.010
His a Theater of the Absurd,
punctuated by violent acts

00:42:46.010 --> 00:42:51.010
from a dangerously eccentric
showman, a murderous clown.

00:42:51.050 --> 00:42:53.430
- [Reporter] The Libyan revolution of 2011

00:42:53.430 --> 00:42:55.890
was about one thing above all else:

00:42:55.890 --> 00:42:58.300
Removing Colonel Gaddafi from power.

00:42:58.300 --> 00:43:00.763
Today concludes that revolution.

00:43:01.770 --> 00:43:04.690
- But of course, it was not,

00:43:04.690 --> 00:43:08.823
it was the beginning of
eight years of civil war.

00:43:09.760 --> 00:43:14.760
So they pursued successful regime change,

00:43:15.810 --> 00:43:20.340
and peace-building turned
out not to be possible.

00:43:20.340 --> 00:43:24.970
It turned out not to be possible
for a number of reasons.

00:43:24.970 --> 00:43:29.100
First of all, there was
nobody that had the capacity

00:43:29.100 --> 00:43:32.290
to run the country, as we saw.

00:43:32.290 --> 00:43:34.882
We were not putting in forces,

00:43:34.882 --> 00:43:38.420
we were prohibited from
putting in boots on the ground,

00:43:38.420 --> 00:43:41.120
and essentially you had rival militias

00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:43.880
controlling different
parts of the country,

00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:47.500
and as the summary video I
showed you at the beginning

00:43:47.500 --> 00:43:52.190
made clear, every effort to
create a national government

00:43:52.190 --> 00:43:57.190
with legitimacy soon fell apart.

00:43:57.950 --> 00:44:01.270
But, that's not all.

00:44:01.270 --> 00:44:05.020
So it was obviously a huge
catastrophe for Libya,

00:44:05.020 --> 00:44:10.020
and the country has just
more or less disintegrated

00:44:10.639 --> 00:44:13.200
over the past eight years,

00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:16.880
and it doesn't show any
signs of turning around,

00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:20.740
but there was huge
fallout across the region.

00:44:20.740 --> 00:44:23.960
First of all, even as far
away as West Africa and Mali,

00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:28.960
it turned out a lot of
Gaddafi's principle guard,

00:44:30.027 --> 00:44:34.820
his elite troops were from
Mali, and they went back to Mali

00:44:34.820 --> 00:44:39.486
and ended up fomenting conflict in Mali,

00:44:39.486 --> 00:44:42.760
which led to the downfall of what had been

00:44:42.760 --> 00:44:47.200
the most stable democratic
regime in West Africa,

00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:51.290
but more important, across
the Middle East, first of all,

00:44:51.290 --> 00:44:55.220
the failed state in Libya
created a massive arms bazaar,

00:44:55.220 --> 00:45:00.220
so weapons and rockets and
tanks even started showing up

00:45:01.120 --> 00:45:05.510
all over the place, feeding the
conflicts in other countries

00:45:05.510 --> 00:45:09.943
and indeed, Libyan rockets
started showing up in Gaza

00:45:09.943 --> 00:45:14.943
in 2014 in the conflict there with Israel.

00:45:15.286 --> 00:45:19.860
But the most disastrous
fallout was in Syria,

00:45:19.860 --> 00:45:22.510
and the most disastrous
fallout was in Syria

00:45:22.510 --> 00:45:26.040
exemplifying what international
relations theorists

00:45:26.040 --> 00:45:30.020
referred to as the moral
hazard of intervention,

00:45:30.020 --> 00:45:32.563
and this is the moral
hazard of intervention.

00:45:33.560 --> 00:45:37.540
The idea is if people
think that if we revolt,

00:45:37.540 --> 00:45:40.000
somebody will intervene and help us,

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:42.630
they will revolt, all right?

00:45:42.630 --> 00:45:45.800
So if you look at what
had been going on in Syria

00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:48.360
before this episode in Libya,

00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:51.310
what had been going on in Syria was

00:45:51.310 --> 00:45:56.070
several years of catastrophic
drought starting in 2007,

00:45:56.070 --> 00:46:01.000
and this had meant that
hundreds of thousands of farmers

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:02.433
had lost everything,

00:46:03.630 --> 00:46:07.050
their crops had died,
their animals had died,

00:46:07.050 --> 00:46:09.160
just catastrophic droughts.

00:46:09.160 --> 00:46:10.440
And so what did they do?

00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:13.960
They went to the cities,
looking for non-existent work.

00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:18.930
And the Assad regime came to USAID,

00:46:18.930 --> 00:46:20.907
they came to the US saying,

00:46:20.907 --> 00:46:23.060
"We need help, we need assistance,"

00:46:23.060 --> 00:46:25.903
and we basically blew them off.

00:46:25.903 --> 00:46:30.380
Even when it reached the
point when it's hard to square

00:46:30.380 --> 00:46:32.390
with our current perception of Assad,

00:46:32.390 --> 00:46:35.410
but this is more than a decade ago now,

00:46:35.410 --> 00:46:38.260
he said he's not gonna be
able to maintain control

00:46:38.260 --> 00:46:41.640
of the country if he doesn't get aid.

00:46:41.640 --> 00:46:44.700
Nonetheless he didn't get it,

00:46:44.700 --> 00:46:49.180
and so when the Arab Spring
erupted in Tunisia and in Egypt,

00:46:49.180 --> 00:46:52.360
there were a lot of these
protests were going on in Syria

00:46:52.360 --> 00:46:57.360
of these destitute farmers,
but it was completely peaceful.

00:46:59.100 --> 00:46:59.933
There was no,

00:47:01.330 --> 00:47:05.150
there was no violent uprising in Syria

00:47:05.150 --> 00:47:09.937
until the uprising in Libya and the 1973

00:47:09.937 --> 00:47:12.720
and the intervention of NATO forces.

00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:15.240
So that's why, our scholars call it

00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:16.980
the moral hazard of intervention,

00:47:16.980 --> 00:47:21.907
they looked at at Libya and
said, "Well, if we revolt,

00:47:21.907 --> 00:47:24.630
"NATO will come and help us too."

00:47:24.630 --> 00:47:25.740
And so they,

00:47:25.740 --> 00:47:28.403
so they ramped up the,

00:47:30.840 --> 00:47:34.760
ramped up the opposition
into violent conflict

00:47:34.760 --> 00:47:38.810
and Assad came down on them
with a hammer, of course,

00:47:38.810 --> 00:47:43.760
and we it turned into, very
rapidly the Syrian crisis

00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:47.990
turned into the worst
humanitarian catastrophe

00:47:47.990 --> 00:47:50.353
of the new century.

00:47:51.450 --> 00:47:56.450
So Obama was then in a very
difficult position because he,

00:48:01.130 --> 00:48:03.100
you might say well, why didn't he,

00:48:03.100 --> 00:48:05.173
why didn't he stick to this?

00:48:05.173 --> 00:48:10.173
This a French-led operation,
we were leading from behind.

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:13.730
That's not how command
and control works in NATO,

00:48:13.730 --> 00:48:16.090
the American generals run the whole,

00:48:16.090 --> 00:48:18.980
if NATO does an operation, the US runs it,

00:48:18.980 --> 00:48:23.090
that's just the way the
force structures work.

00:48:23.090 --> 00:48:26.010
So the Americans were
deeply involved in this,

00:48:26.010 --> 00:48:30.200
and so as things deteriorated in Syria,

00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:32.620
he was in a very difficult spot,

00:48:32.620 --> 00:48:34.680
even though particularly when Assad

00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:38.010
started doing things like
using chemical weapons,

00:48:38.010 --> 00:48:40.570
he began calling for regime change,

00:48:40.570 --> 00:48:43.113
so you'd see just a few clips here.

00:48:44.110 --> 00:48:47.690
- President Assad had lost credibility

00:48:47.690 --> 00:48:51.360
that he attacked his own people,

00:48:51.360 --> 00:48:53.530
has killed his own people,

00:48:53.530 --> 00:48:57.010
unleashed a military
against innocent civilians,

00:48:57.010 --> 00:49:01.410
and that the only way to bring
stability and peace to Syria

00:49:01.410 --> 00:49:03.330
is gonna be for Assad to step down

00:49:03.330 --> 00:49:05.723
and to move forward on
a political transition.

00:49:06.630 --> 00:49:10.340
We're gonna keep increasing the
pressure on the Assad regime

00:49:10.340 --> 00:49:13.240
and working with the Syrian opposition.

00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:15.450
Assad needs to go.

00:49:15.450 --> 00:49:18.490
He needs to transfer power
to a transitional body,

00:49:18.490 --> 00:49:21.830
that is the only way that we're
gonna resolve this crisis.

00:49:21.830 --> 00:49:24.190
The only way that the civil war will end

00:49:24.190 --> 00:49:26.200
and in a way so that the Syrian people

00:49:26.200 --> 00:49:29.670
can unite against ISIL is an
inclusive political transition

00:49:29.670 --> 00:49:33.333
to a new government without Bashar Assad,

00:49:33.333 --> 00:49:36.340
a government that serves all Syrians.

00:49:36.340 --> 00:49:38.770
I discussed this with our
Gulf Cooperation Council

00:49:38.770 --> 00:49:41.290
partners at Camp David,
and during my recent call

00:49:41.290 --> 00:49:42.563
with President Putin.

00:49:43.870 --> 00:49:46.047
- So, "Assad must go, Assad must go,

00:49:46.047 --> 00:49:48.940
"and I'm even telling
Putin Assad must go,"

00:49:48.940 --> 00:49:53.750
but the truth is, Obama was
completely hamstrung in Syria.

00:49:53.750 --> 00:49:57.270
He was hamstrung, first of
all, there was no possibility

00:49:57.270 --> 00:50:00.930
of Security Council
authorization to go into Libya

00:50:00.930 --> 00:50:05.290
after there was this
widespread perception at the UN

00:50:05.290 --> 00:50:10.290
that NATO had completely
violated the containment language

00:50:10.890 --> 00:50:15.890
and remit of 1973 and
basically underwritten

00:50:15.920 --> 00:50:18.053
the overthrow of Gaddafi.

00:50:18.910 --> 00:50:20.493
So secondly,

00:50:23.440 --> 00:50:27.120
Obama's very shrewd
political instincts knew

00:50:27.120 --> 00:50:31.250
that in getting involved
in a civil war in Syria

00:50:31.250 --> 00:50:34.380
would be a domestic political
catastrophe for him,

00:50:34.380 --> 00:50:38.160
so he couldn't possibly
actually make it happen,

00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:40.530
so but then you're in this position

00:50:40.530 --> 00:50:42.170
of demonstrating weakness,

00:50:42.170 --> 00:50:44.800
for which the Republicans
attacked him relentlessly,

00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:47.360
drawing lines in the sand, Assad must go,

00:50:47.360 --> 00:50:48.900
not making it happen.

00:50:48.900 --> 00:50:51.010
But of course, it was bait for him,

00:50:51.010 --> 00:50:53.540
as far as they were
concerned because they knew

00:50:53.540 --> 00:50:58.353
it would be a political disaster
for him if he got involved.

00:50:59.320 --> 00:51:03.053
And he realized by then that
he'd been suckered into Libya.

00:51:05.160 --> 00:51:08.140
He'd been suckered, I
should have just given you

00:51:08.140 --> 00:51:13.140
one more wrinkle about how
Hillary got turned around on this

00:51:13.640 --> 00:51:15.443
because it's quite remarkable.

00:51:19.065 --> 00:51:23.000
The Select Committee on Benghazi
that was going after her

00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:28.000
because of the death of four
consular officials in Benghazi,

00:51:28.330 --> 00:51:32.560
as you might recall, unearthed
documents which showed

00:51:32.560 --> 00:51:36.000
her personal friend and
advisor, Sydney Blumenthal,

00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:38.610
who had no role in the government,

00:51:38.610 --> 00:51:42.410
sending endless numbers
of emails telling Hillary

00:51:42.410 --> 00:51:46.743
that the US needed to get
involved in the Libya,

00:51:48.490 --> 00:51:51.160
in the Libyan operation, why?

00:51:51.160 --> 00:51:56.160
It turned out because he, Blumenthal,

00:51:56.299 --> 00:51:58.390
wanted to get into the,

00:51:58.390 --> 00:52:01.830
he had interests in Libyan oil and he was,

00:52:01.830 --> 00:52:04.851
there are emails from
him to Hillary saying

00:52:04.851 --> 00:52:08.170
that the French are grabbing
all the oil concessions.

00:52:08.170 --> 00:52:11.760
And so again, we might
think of this about ideals

00:52:11.760 --> 00:52:15.210
and humanitarian intervention,

00:52:15.210 --> 00:52:19.270
but there's this material
a story of people with

00:52:20.740 --> 00:52:24.253
real interests at stake
pushing this agenda.

00:52:25.180 --> 00:52:30.180
So I think, and by then, Obama
realized that to some extent

00:52:30.590 --> 00:52:34.143
he had been suckered by her,

00:52:35.370 --> 00:52:40.050
if not her intentionality,
certainly by her gullibility.

00:52:40.050 --> 00:52:45.050
And so he was very unlikely to
succumb to going into Syria.

00:52:46.660 --> 00:52:48.920
Syria moreover was,

00:52:48.920 --> 00:52:53.520
Afghanistan and and Libya had
been two-sided civil wars,

00:52:53.520 --> 00:52:56.790
Syria was a three-sided
civil war because by then,

00:52:56.790 --> 00:53:01.790
ISIS had emerged and there was
the various opposition groups

00:53:03.130 --> 00:53:06.400
to the regime, and then
there was the Assad regime.

00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:09.520
And if we couldn't prevail
in a two-sided civil war

00:53:09.520 --> 00:53:12.610
supporting one side, how
were we gonna be effective

00:53:12.610 --> 00:53:14.170
in a three-sided civil war?

00:53:14.170 --> 00:53:18.690
Because one of the ugly truths
of the post Cold War-era

00:53:18.690 --> 00:53:23.690
is that my enemy's enemy
might turn out to be my enemy.

00:53:23.700 --> 00:53:26.910
In the Cold War, there's two sides

00:53:26.910 --> 00:53:29.800
and you know who's on which
side, and so on and so forth,

00:53:29.800 --> 00:53:33.710
one of the reasons by the
way there's the Libyan thing

00:53:33.710 --> 00:53:36.770
is ongoing is that the
Trump administration

00:53:36.770 --> 00:53:38.950
is now supporting the other side,

00:53:38.950 --> 00:53:41.350
because the Saudis are
supporting the other side

00:53:42.400 --> 00:53:44.980
from the UN and this side that

00:53:46.581 --> 00:53:49.530
the US has traditionally supported.

00:53:49.530 --> 00:53:54.030
So it was a three-sided,

00:53:54.030 --> 00:53:59.030
and then former Ambassador Polk
has done an exhaustive study

00:53:59.850 --> 00:54:04.363
of the opposition groups,
and there were no,

00:54:04.363 --> 00:54:05.930
it was again like Libya,

00:54:05.930 --> 00:54:10.023
there was no Democratic
opposition in Syria.

00:54:11.196 --> 00:54:15.200
And then finally, the
Democrats had no alternative

00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:16.660
to the Bush Doctrine.

00:54:16.660 --> 00:54:20.845
I said this last time when we
talked about the deficiencies

00:54:20.845 --> 00:54:22.580
of the Bush Doctrine,

00:54:22.580 --> 00:54:24.720
but what was the democratic alternative?

00:54:24.720 --> 00:54:29.580
They had no well articulated
conception of containment.

00:54:29.580 --> 00:54:32.640
And indeed, that I mentioned that talk

00:54:32.640 --> 00:54:37.314
I gave at the University
at the Yale Club of Tokyo,

00:54:37.314 --> 00:54:39.760
that eventually became the little book

00:54:39.760 --> 00:54:41.750
I wrote about containment,

00:54:41.750 --> 00:54:45.160
arguing that if the Democrats
went back into office

00:54:45.160 --> 00:54:48.130
without a national security strategy,

00:54:48.130 --> 00:54:49.700
they were gonna be pushed around,

00:54:49.700 --> 00:54:53.970
as Obama was indeed pushed around in Libya

00:54:53.970 --> 00:54:56.590
because not having a
strategy and doing things

00:54:56.590 --> 00:55:00.880
like triangulation leads
you to be manipulated

00:55:00.880 --> 00:55:05.140
by people who have a clear
sense of what they want to do.

00:55:05.140 --> 00:55:09.660
And indeed, the Russians,

00:55:09.660 --> 00:55:12.633
when they went finally
into the Syrian conflict,

00:55:13.820 --> 00:55:17.280
Obama yelled had screamed
and stamped his feet

00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:20.440
but he couldn't do anything
about it, and unlike us,

00:55:20.440 --> 00:55:22.240
they had a clear strategy.

00:55:22.240 --> 00:55:26.570
Their strategy was to help
Assad win the civil war,

00:55:26.570 --> 00:55:28.250
which they then did.

00:55:28.250 --> 00:55:32.690
And so now Assad basically
has won the civil war.

00:55:32.690 --> 00:55:37.690
So we on the other hand have
no strategy in the Middle East,

00:55:38.510 --> 00:55:42.040
and this is continuing to play out today

00:55:42.890 --> 00:55:46.053
as we are watching in real-time that

00:55:46.053 --> 00:55:50.740
whatever you say about Trump's
abandonment of the Kurds,

00:55:50.740 --> 00:55:55.740
it completely, his entry
into that whole conflict

00:55:57.900 --> 00:56:01.250
is the correct observation
that the US doesn't have

00:56:01.250 --> 00:56:05.610
a strategy there and there
is no democratic regime

00:56:05.610 --> 00:56:07.340
that's being supported.

00:56:07.340 --> 00:56:09.920
The Kurds, supporting the Kurds,

00:56:09.920 --> 00:56:12.750
supporting the Kurds is
a bit like supporting

00:56:12.750 --> 00:56:15.623
the Northern Alliance in Afghanistan.

00:56:16.640 --> 00:56:18.530
The Kurds are scattered through

00:56:18.530 --> 00:56:20.530
a number of Middle Eastern countries,

00:56:20.530 --> 00:56:23.240
the Kurdistan that they
would like to build,

00:56:23.240 --> 00:56:26.820
it would involve going to
war with several of them.

00:56:26.820 --> 00:56:31.640
Turkey, for all of its appalling
behavior, is a NATO ally,

00:56:31.640 --> 00:56:33.230
the Kurds are not.

00:56:33.230 --> 00:56:37.100
As I said, one's enemy's
enemy can turn out

00:56:37.100 --> 00:56:39.930
very easily to be one's enemy.

00:56:39.930 --> 00:56:43.160
And so we have throughout the rest of the

00:56:43.160 --> 00:56:48.090
Obama administration but
really starting in 2003

00:56:48.090 --> 00:56:52.770
have had no coherent
strategy of what it is

00:56:52.770 --> 00:56:57.350
that we're actually trying to
achieve in these conflicts.

00:56:57.350 --> 00:57:01.958
And so Trump took advantage
of that and ran with it.

00:57:01.958 --> 00:57:05.810
And that's not the only fallout
from the Libyan conflict.

00:57:05.810 --> 00:57:07.560
It's quite a lot, but there's more.

00:57:08.590 --> 00:57:10.060
- As we return now to the attack

00:57:10.060 --> 00:57:12.760
on a migrant detention center in Libya,

00:57:12.760 --> 00:57:15.670
as John yang tells us
eight years of conflict

00:57:15.670 --> 00:57:18.880
and instability there are
now enmeshed with the migrant

00:57:18.880 --> 00:57:20.343
and refugee crisis.

00:57:22.010 --> 00:57:25.090
- [John] Bags of clothing
and abandoned shoes.

00:57:25.090 --> 00:57:27.710
Remnants of life strewn
throughout the blood-soaked

00:57:27.710 --> 00:57:29.240
debris of death.

00:57:29.240 --> 00:57:30.700
The early morning air strike

00:57:30.700 --> 00:57:33.270
hit the Tajoura Migrant
Detention Center in Tripoli

00:57:33.270 --> 00:57:37.130
housing some 600 people,
mostly North Africans.

00:57:37.130 --> 00:57:40.250
Emergency crews struggled
to carry away body bags

00:57:40.250 --> 00:57:41.760
through the wreckage.

00:57:41.760 --> 00:57:45.853
Survivors said they had no
warning and no protection.

00:57:53.790 --> 00:57:56.010
- [John] Libya's government
of national accord

00:57:56.010 --> 00:57:59.060
recognized by the United
Nations blamed the so-called

00:57:59.060 --> 00:58:01.800
Libyan National Army, or LNA,

00:58:01.800 --> 00:58:04.110
which is trying to seize Tripoli.

00:58:04.110 --> 00:58:06.920
The LNA acknowledged carrying
out attacks in the area

00:58:06.920 --> 00:58:09.140
but denied targeting the migrants.

00:58:09.140 --> 00:58:12.390
The LNA under the command
of General Khalifa Haftar

00:58:12.390 --> 00:58:14.980
is supported by Saudi Arabia, Egypt,

00:58:14.980 --> 00:58:17.250
and the United Arab Emirates.

00:58:17.250 --> 00:58:19.500
It controls southern and eastern Libya,

00:58:19.500 --> 00:58:21.140
but has met heavy resistance

00:58:21.140 --> 00:58:23.240
from militias defending Tripoli.

00:58:23.240 --> 00:58:27.440
Yesterday, an LNA commander
warned of intensified assaults.

00:58:27.440 --> 00:58:29.160
This is the latest calamity

00:58:29.160 --> 00:58:31.970
in eight years of chaos in Libya.

00:58:31.970 --> 00:58:34.720
Fighting has also made an
already desperate journey

00:58:34.720 --> 00:58:36.670
for migrants trying to reach Europe

00:58:36.670 --> 00:58:39.560
even more dangerous and deadly.

00:58:39.560 --> 00:58:43.490
An estimated 6,000 languish
in Libyan detention,

00:58:43.490 --> 00:58:46.770
at least half close to the
front lines of conflict.

00:58:46.770 --> 00:58:48.710
- In the last three months,

00:58:48.710 --> 00:58:52.720
Tripoli and the neighboring
areas around Tripoli

00:58:52.720 --> 00:58:54.530
have become an active war zone.

00:58:54.530 --> 00:58:57.330
So now we have migrants who
are in abysmal conditions

00:58:57.330 --> 00:58:59.670
in detention, but on top of that,

00:58:59.670 --> 00:59:02.690
they can't flee to
safer areas of the city.

00:59:02.690 --> 00:59:04.330
- [John] Many of the
migrants were rounded up

00:59:04.330 --> 00:59:05.900
by Libya's Coast Guard,

00:59:05.900 --> 00:59:08.640
trained and funded by the European Union,

00:59:08.640 --> 00:59:11.420
to prevent their crossing
the Mediterranean.

00:59:11.420 --> 00:59:14.022
- Several member states
of the EU have effectively

00:59:14.022 --> 00:59:17.038
begun criminalizing aid agencies

00:59:17.038 --> 00:59:20.760
who were providing such
and rescue services

00:59:20.760 --> 00:59:22.173
in the Mediterranean Sea.

00:59:23.360 --> 00:59:27.570
And in the absence of those
search and rescue operations,

00:59:27.570 --> 00:59:30.660
people who continue to try to flee Libya

00:59:30.660 --> 00:59:32.780
and cross the Mediterranean Sea

00:59:32.780 --> 00:59:35.020
are intercepted by the Libyan Coast Guard

00:59:35.020 --> 00:59:37.447
and returned to Libya
and are sent directly

00:59:37.447 --> 00:59:39.483
into the detention centers.

00:59:40.860 --> 00:59:44.470
- So in addition to everything else,

00:59:44.470 --> 00:59:47.530
this has fed the refugee
problem in Europe,

00:59:47.530 --> 00:59:52.060
which has fed the rise of
anti-system parties in Europe

00:59:52.060 --> 00:59:54.330
and countries like Germany.

00:59:54.330 --> 00:59:56.600
People like Angela Merkel were initially

00:59:56.600 --> 00:59:59.110
open arms for these refugees,

00:59:59.110 --> 01:00:01.800
but as we know from earlier lectures,

01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:06.030
that soon turned into
political catastrophe for her.

01:00:06.030 --> 01:00:10.410
And so this ongoing, the
externalities of this

01:00:10.410 --> 01:00:14.123
as an economist would
put it are just stunning.

01:00:16.251 --> 01:00:21.251
So those are the sort of
local and then regional

01:00:21.320 --> 01:00:26.320
and even international costs
of this, toppling this regime.

01:00:27.540 --> 01:00:30.430
So we've done a big, a deep dive into

01:00:30.430 --> 01:00:35.080
some micro stories here, things
are often not what they seem

01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:38.150
but let's now step back
a little and think about

01:00:38.150 --> 01:00:41.470
what does this mean for the
doctrine of responsibility

01:00:41.470 --> 01:00:45.430
to protect, and what are its implications

01:00:45.430 --> 01:00:50.320
for other forms of
humanitarian intervention?

01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:54.050
So thinking back to the earlier
lecture on responsibility

01:00:54.050 --> 01:00:57.900
to protect, we now have to recognize

01:00:57.900 --> 01:01:01.140
that the Kosovo operation
was misleadingly benign.

01:01:01.140 --> 01:01:04.830
It gave people much too much confidence

01:01:04.830 --> 01:01:09.830
in what can be achieved
by forcible intervention

01:01:09.890 --> 01:01:12.380
in these types of situations.

01:01:12.380 --> 01:01:17.380
First of all, in 1999, Kosovo
was already in the middle a,

01:01:19.430 --> 01:01:22.370
it was in the middle of a
civil war in a failed state,

01:01:22.370 --> 01:01:25.880
so the idea that one might
be creating a failed state

01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:29.143
by intervening was not on the table.

01:01:30.010 --> 01:01:34.010
Secondly, unlike the story in Benghazi

01:01:34.010 --> 01:01:38.130
that was mostly hype and
widely discredited at the time,

01:01:38.130 --> 01:01:41.350
if you go back and look
at the news coverage,

01:01:41.350 --> 01:01:44.850
it was undeniable that there
was ongoing ethnic cleansing

01:01:44.850 --> 01:01:48.693
and gross human rights
abuses going on in Kosovo.

01:01:50.470 --> 01:01:54.183
Third, the intervention was
brief and it seemed to work,

01:01:55.380 --> 01:01:58.820
and that led to enormous
hubris about the effectiveness

01:01:58.820 --> 01:02:03.420
of surgical power in
rearranging the furniture

01:02:03.420 --> 01:02:06.263
in the targeted regime.

01:02:07.690 --> 01:02:10.620
Another feature of it
was that NATO and the US

01:02:10.620 --> 01:02:13.650
plausibly had clean hands in Kosovo.

01:02:13.650 --> 01:02:16.303
There was nothing really
strategic at stake for them.

01:02:17.640 --> 01:02:19.730
I said it violated the NATO charter

01:02:19.730 --> 01:02:21.770
that they got involved because they were,

01:02:21.770 --> 01:02:23.570
none of them was threatened, but really,

01:02:23.570 --> 01:02:25.850
they didn't have anything
to gain out of this.

01:02:25.850 --> 01:02:30.580
So the notion that there was
some surreptitious agenda,

01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:34.621
as we've now seen there
was surreptitious agenda

01:02:34.621 --> 01:02:38.320
going on in Libya wasn't there,

01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:40.683
and it wasn't there for good reasons.

01:02:42.270 --> 01:02:45.750
Also, the Kosovo operation was before

01:02:45.750 --> 01:02:48.070
the US-led invasion of Iraq

01:02:48.070 --> 01:02:50.550
had sullied our international image.

01:02:50.550 --> 01:02:53.910
Think again to the story about Abu Ghraib

01:02:53.910 --> 01:02:56.030
that we ended with last time.

01:02:56.030 --> 01:03:00.759
We were perceived very differently in 1999

01:03:00.759 --> 01:03:05.759
across the Middle East than
we were perceived after 2003.

01:03:07.890 --> 01:03:11.740
And just to add to that,
the intervention in Kosovo

01:03:11.740 --> 01:03:13.873
had been on behalf of Muslims,

01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:18.790
so that muted criticism in the Middle East

01:03:18.790 --> 01:03:21.300
and the global south, even
though there was some,

01:03:21.300 --> 01:03:24.279
but we were, it was the Americans and NATO

01:03:24.279 --> 01:03:28.710
intervening to protect Muslims in Kosovo.

01:03:28.710 --> 01:03:32.530
So for all of those reasons,
there was much more confidence

01:03:32.530 --> 01:03:36.660
in the ability to implement R2P

01:03:36.660 --> 01:03:39.950
than we now see was warranted,

01:03:39.950 --> 01:03:44.739
but people like Samantha Power
and Susan Rice and others

01:03:44.739 --> 01:03:49.063
therefore were far too optimistic.

01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:52.640
And when we take stock,
there are really three,

01:03:52.640 --> 01:03:55.530
three big challenges
one has to think about

01:03:55.530 --> 01:03:59.580
when we're talking about
humanitarian intervention.

01:03:59.580 --> 01:04:02.930
One is big principal-agent challenges.

01:04:02.930 --> 01:04:06.360
So if you're thinking
about somebody going in

01:04:06.360 --> 01:04:10.430
to intervene in a country,
who is the right principal?

01:04:10.430 --> 01:04:11.400
Who should go in?

01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:15.810
Who should make the decision
to go in, I should say?

01:04:15.810 --> 01:04:17.653
And then who's the right agent?

01:04:18.840 --> 01:04:23.840
During the Cold War, the
sort of agreement was that

01:04:24.650 --> 01:04:28.420
the US and the Soviets
would not send people in,

01:04:28.420 --> 01:04:30.310
that's why in the Middle East,

01:04:30.310 --> 01:04:34.220
you'd get sort of Norwegian
blue hats or whatever

01:04:34.220 --> 01:04:39.220
because if you have an obvious
interest, there's a problem.

01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:42.180
But most importantly,
how does the principal

01:04:42.180 --> 01:04:43.603
control the agent?

01:04:45.156 --> 01:04:50.050
Once the UN Security Council
has authorized NATO to act

01:04:50.050 --> 01:04:54.680
and they're acting, it's
very difficult to reconvene

01:04:54.680 --> 01:04:58.080
and reverse those decisions because

01:05:00.500 --> 01:05:04.380
any one of the permanent
members can veto efforts,

01:05:04.380 --> 01:05:06.320
efforts to do that.

01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:09.550
So Brazil has been
pushing something called

01:05:09.550 --> 01:05:13.090
the Doctrine of Responsibility
while protecting,

01:05:13.090 --> 01:05:15.530
trying to create monitoring ongoing,

01:05:15.530 --> 01:05:18.480
monitoring device of interventions,

01:05:18.480 --> 01:05:21.513
but I think good luck with that.

01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:24.890
Then there are questions
about effectiveness.

01:05:27.780 --> 01:05:32.360
Peace-building is very
difficult after an intervention.

01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:35.350
If you look at the literature
that's been published by,

01:05:35.350 --> 01:05:38.160
the empirical literature
on peace-building,

01:05:38.160 --> 01:05:42.013
some of which I will post
if people are interested,

01:05:42.013 --> 01:05:45.610
it's extremely difficult to
do after an intervention.

01:05:45.610 --> 01:05:49.123
I talked about this some
in relation to Germany,

01:05:49.123 --> 01:05:52.660
West Germany and Japan after World War II,

01:05:52.660 --> 01:05:57.290
but particularly when you
go in during a civil war,

01:05:57.290 --> 01:06:01.940
again, we went in supporting
what turned out to be

01:06:01.940 --> 01:06:04.520
the losing side in a civil war

01:06:04.520 --> 01:06:06.150
and then we we basically

01:06:10.150 --> 01:06:15.110
knocked off the regime that
that had very little legitimacy,

01:06:15.110 --> 01:06:16.910
but neither did anyone else.

01:06:16.910 --> 01:06:20.650
And so peace-building operations
are extremely expensive,

01:06:20.650 --> 01:06:25.133
extremely slow, and don't work very well.

01:06:26.430 --> 01:06:29.020
Civil wars are, one of the main factors

01:06:29.020 --> 01:06:30.580
the scholarly literature shows,

01:06:30.580 --> 01:06:33.560
one of the main factors
that lengthens civil wars

01:06:33.560 --> 01:06:36.470
is often external involvement.

01:06:36.470 --> 01:06:39.130
If you look now at the civil war in Yemen,

01:06:39.130 --> 01:06:43.800
it's becoming a proxy
conflict between the Saudis

01:06:43.800 --> 01:06:47.320
and the Iranians.

01:06:47.320 --> 01:06:52.320
And so once you start supporting
one side in a civil war,

01:06:53.301 --> 01:06:57.440
the chances are, if I just come
in and support other sides,

01:06:57.440 --> 01:06:59.380
the conflict's just gonna go on,

01:06:59.380 --> 01:07:02.390
whereas if nobody gets
involved from the outside,

01:07:02.390 --> 01:07:07.380
most civil wars eventually end
in about five years or less.

01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:13.480
But they're gonna also be
huge legitimacy challenges.

01:07:13.480 --> 01:07:17.590
There's no obligation to
intervene, I've said this earlier,

01:07:17.590 --> 01:07:22.230
so it's a case-by-case discretion
for the Security Council,

01:07:22.230 --> 01:07:25.870
but that effectively creates immunity

01:07:25.870 --> 01:07:29.390
for the Security Council
members and their allies.

01:07:29.390 --> 01:07:33.283
In 2014, when Israel went into Gaza,

01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:38.490
there were widespread
allegations of R2P violations

01:07:38.490 --> 01:07:43.490
on both sides by Hamas
and by the Israeli troops,

01:07:44.650 --> 01:07:46.560
but the idea that there was gonna be

01:07:46.560 --> 01:07:48.760
some kind of humanitarian intervention

01:07:48.760 --> 01:07:51.640
of course is unthinkable when you consider

01:07:51.640 --> 01:07:55.530
the alliances of people
on the Security Council.

01:07:55.530 --> 01:07:59.010
So this doctrine is
gonna be perceived to be

01:07:59.010 --> 01:08:04.010
an instrument by which
the countries that are in

01:08:04.060 --> 01:08:06.840
the driver's seat in the Security Council

01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:11.840
are going to protect
themselves and not others.

01:08:12.870 --> 01:08:15.340
So what are the lessons?

01:08:15.340 --> 01:08:18.870
Well, one is that R2P
should remain exceptional.

01:08:18.870 --> 01:08:22.350
As I said when we were
talking about this idea of

01:08:22.350 --> 01:08:26.190
illegal but legitimate,
it's a bit like asking

01:08:26.190 --> 01:08:28.740
for forgiveness rather than permission,

01:08:28.740 --> 01:08:30.480
but you can't institutionalize that,

01:08:30.480 --> 01:08:31.730
so it should be exceptional,

01:08:31.730 --> 01:08:34.770
it should be very, very difficult to do.

01:08:34.770 --> 01:08:38.573
You need exceedingly high
thresholds for intervention,

01:08:40.140 --> 01:08:42.380
because if you intervene,

01:08:42.380 --> 01:08:45.790
if you take on a government
on its own territory,

01:08:45.790 --> 01:08:49.810
you are almost by definition gonna take,

01:08:49.810 --> 01:08:53.680
you're courting the possibility
of creating a failed state.

01:08:53.680 --> 01:08:56.430
It's important therefore
to keep force proportional

01:08:56.430 --> 01:08:58.590
to the problem.

01:08:58.590 --> 01:09:03.440
And as as within days
of 1973 being adopted

01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:05.760
by the Security Council, it was clear

01:09:05.760 --> 01:09:08.870
that the potential humanitarian
catastrophe in Benghazi

01:09:08.870 --> 01:09:13.870
was over, Gaddafi's Air Force
had been destroyed as well,

01:09:14.830 --> 01:09:19.830
and the overtures being
made by the African Union

01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:22.920
and the Arab League should
have been listened to,

01:09:22.920 --> 01:09:26.580
to negotiate some sort of ceasefire.

01:09:26.580 --> 01:09:31.010
Regime change should always
be the last and final resort.

01:09:31.010 --> 01:09:33.850
Interested players are very bad agents,

01:09:33.850 --> 01:09:35.870
but the UN doesn't have a military,

01:09:35.870 --> 01:09:38.463
so who are gonna be the agents?

01:09:40.610 --> 01:09:43.410
Peace-building, as I said, it's essential,

01:09:43.410 --> 01:09:46.590
but very difficult to do.

01:09:46.590 --> 01:09:48.960
You might say a better focus rather than

01:09:48.960 --> 01:09:52.110
responsibility to protect would be,

01:09:52.110 --> 01:09:55.370
or responsibility while protecting

01:09:55.370 --> 01:09:57.993
would be responsibility to prevent.

01:09:59.100 --> 01:10:02.770
I said to you earlier
that the crisis in Syria

01:10:02.770 --> 01:10:06.630
really starts ramping up
in 2007 and eight and nine

01:10:06.630 --> 01:10:08.010
because of the droughts.

01:10:08.010 --> 01:10:10.920
That would have been
the time to intervene.

01:10:10.920 --> 01:10:13.740
Look at a country today like Chad.

01:10:13.740 --> 01:10:17.000
It's a landlocked country
surrounded on all sides

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.440
by failed states.

01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:20.813
It's oil-dependent,

01:10:22.520 --> 01:10:27.520
that makes it a prime
target, a prime candidate for

01:10:27.560 --> 01:10:32.350
this sort of collapse and
humanitarian catastrophe

01:10:32.350 --> 01:10:35.600
that we have seen in Libya and Syria.

01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:38.150
But what is anybody doing about Chad?

01:10:38.150 --> 01:10:38.983
Very little.

01:10:40.520 --> 01:10:44.323
So just to sum up,

01:10:45.250 --> 01:10:50.040
I think that, if you think over
the course of these lectures

01:10:50.040 --> 01:10:55.040
on resisting aggression across borders,

01:10:55.340 --> 01:10:58.930
it is possible to come up
with an integrated account

01:10:58.930 --> 01:11:01.560
that builds off of Kennan's insights

01:11:01.560 --> 01:11:03.870
for a post-Cold War world.

01:11:03.870 --> 01:11:07.670
And I take the three
elements of his view to be

01:11:07.670 --> 01:11:09.740
economize on the use of force,

01:11:09.740 --> 01:11:12.600
keep it sufficient but proportional.

01:11:12.600 --> 01:11:15.380
Don't destroy the village
in order to save it,

01:11:15.380 --> 01:11:17.580
the famous line from Vietnam.

01:11:17.580 --> 01:11:21.600
Always remember that
the biggest challenge is

01:11:21.600 --> 01:11:23.920
and the most important battle to win

01:11:23.920 --> 01:11:26.090
is the battle for hearts and minds,

01:11:26.090 --> 01:11:29.390
not the military confrontation,

01:11:29.390 --> 01:11:33.260
that is not gonna create
a governable country.

01:11:33.260 --> 01:11:37.350
And stop the bully without becoming one.

01:11:37.350 --> 01:11:39.240
This idea to prevent domination,

01:11:39.240 --> 01:11:41.690
but without yourselves dominating.

01:11:41.690 --> 01:11:44.680
Machiavelli says at the
outset of the discourses,

01:11:44.680 --> 01:11:47.430
he says the reason he favors democracy

01:11:47.430 --> 01:11:50.040
is that the elites want to dominate,

01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:53.210
and the common people
want not to be dominated.

01:11:53.210 --> 01:11:55.410
So this is the idea of prevent domination

01:11:55.410 --> 01:11:57.543
without becoming a dominator.

01:11:58.917 --> 01:12:01.710
And if you wanted to sort of
draw a conceptual map here

01:12:01.710 --> 01:12:04.233
of resisting aggression across borders,

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.200
you could do something like this.

01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:10.690
You could say, well think about domination

01:12:10.690 --> 01:12:12.080
that crosses borders.

01:12:12.080 --> 01:12:15.840
First, there's self-defense,
if a country attacks you,

01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:17.523
that's the strongest case.

01:12:18.450 --> 01:12:20.520
Classic containment, you want to prevent,

01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:22.313
you want to head that off,

01:12:24.270 --> 01:12:27.770
a country that's in the
position to do that.

01:12:27.770 --> 01:12:30.640
So I think Kennedy during
the Cuban Missile Crisis

01:12:30.640 --> 01:12:33.483
gradually ramping up enough,

01:12:36.350 --> 01:12:39.843
the embargo and so on, that is the way to,

01:12:43.490 --> 01:12:46.270
to prevent threats to the
homeland, if you like.

01:12:46.270 --> 01:12:48.994
Make war a strategy of last resort,

01:12:48.994 --> 01:12:53.410
and ramp it up, ramp up
hostility proportionately.

01:12:53.410 --> 01:12:56.330
If you're going in to
defend a third party,

01:12:56.330 --> 01:12:58.341
as we did in Kuwait,

01:12:58.341 --> 01:13:03.341
in Iraq, when Iraq went
into Kuwait in 1991,

01:13:03.501 --> 01:13:06.200
then we should be thinking
about containment again

01:13:06.200 --> 01:13:10.302
first of all authorization,
there needs to be authorization.

01:13:10.302 --> 01:13:13.820
That could be invitation
from a legitimate government,

01:13:13.820 --> 01:13:16.000
as was the case in Kuwait,

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.650
or it could be external authorization

01:13:18.650 --> 01:13:20.793
through something like the UN.

01:13:21.940 --> 01:13:24.000
When we're thinking about crossing borders

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:25.703
to resist domination,

01:13:28.020 --> 01:13:30.170
there's got to be a higher threshold,

01:13:30.170 --> 01:13:32.420
because the stakes are so much higher

01:13:32.420 --> 01:13:36.660
because once you're a crossing
border in order to resist

01:13:36.660 --> 01:13:38.380
or to prevent domination,

01:13:38.380 --> 01:13:40.680
that might be better to
say than resist there,

01:13:42.250 --> 01:13:45.010
you're inevitably courting the possibility

01:13:45.010 --> 01:13:47.010
of creating a failed state.

01:13:47.010 --> 01:13:50.250
So with responsibility to protect,

01:13:50.250 --> 01:13:52.215
there must be the imminent danger

01:13:52.215 --> 01:13:55.320
of human rights violations,

01:13:55.320 --> 01:13:57.720
there must be external authorization,

01:13:57.720 --> 01:14:00.190
there must be a diverse coalition,

01:14:00.190 --> 01:14:04.380
there must be a limited mandate
which it should be observed

01:14:04.380 --> 01:14:09.380
as was done in 1991 in
Iraq, but not in 2003,

01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:15.163
and regime change should be
the absolute final resort.

01:14:16.610 --> 01:14:20.100
What about intervening
to install democracy?

01:14:20.100 --> 01:14:22.070
This is the most ambitious of all.

01:14:22.070 --> 01:14:25.680
We're not intervening, this
is a neoconservative dream,

01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:29.310
not just to stop particular
human rights violations,

01:14:29.310 --> 01:14:31.890
but actually to produce regime change.

01:14:31.890 --> 01:14:35.960
And there, first of all,

01:14:35.960 --> 01:14:38.440
there's no point in trying
to install democracy

01:14:38.440 --> 01:14:41.140
in a country where the
plausible economic conditions

01:14:41.140 --> 01:14:43.360
don't exist, we know what they are,

01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:46.240
per capita income of about $14,000,

01:14:46.240 --> 01:14:51.240
a diverse economy being
the two most important.

01:14:51.921 --> 01:14:53.910
There must be an opposition

01:14:53.910 --> 01:14:57.710
that is predominantly indigenous.

01:14:57.710 --> 01:14:59.970
Part of the problem with Ahmed Chalabi,

01:14:59.970 --> 01:15:03.410
he had been living in London for decades,

01:15:03.410 --> 01:15:05.826
and when things didn't work out in Iraq,

01:15:05.826 --> 01:15:07.523
he could go back to London.

01:15:09.330 --> 01:15:11.418
But he did go back and forth to London

01:15:11.418 --> 01:15:13.810
when things got bad for him.

01:15:13.810 --> 01:15:17.938
You really want the indigenous
opposition because they have,

01:15:17.938 --> 01:15:20.175
it's like you want the pilot on the plane.

01:15:20.175 --> 01:15:24.570
You want people for
whom if this goes badly,

01:15:24.570 --> 01:15:27.710
they're gonna pay the
price before you go in

01:15:29.860 --> 01:15:32.500
and help them, or try to help them.

01:15:32.500 --> 01:15:34.930
You must have some credible conviction

01:15:34.930 --> 01:15:36.863
that they're capable of governing,

01:15:38.280 --> 01:15:41.850
and some credible conviction

01:15:41.850 --> 01:15:44.370
that they're likely to be democratic.

01:15:44.370 --> 01:15:49.370
So even if and when one side
wins in this Libyan civil war,

01:15:51.570 --> 01:15:55.430
there's no guarantee that
it's going to be democratic.

01:15:55.430 --> 01:15:59.150
Indeed, it seems vanishingly unlikely

01:15:59.150 --> 01:16:01.980
that that would be the case.

01:16:01.980 --> 01:16:05.890
So I think, if you want to
sort of think conceptually

01:16:05.890 --> 01:16:09.980
about what should be
guiding policy thinking

01:16:09.980 --> 01:16:13.200
about humanitarian and
other forms of intervention,

01:16:13.200 --> 01:16:16.600
it would look something like
that in a post-Cold War,

01:16:16.600 --> 01:16:20.090
which would ramp up the
stakes appropriately

01:16:20.090 --> 01:16:24.330
as the risks and costs
of failure accelerate.

01:16:24.330 --> 01:16:27.930
But the big problem we now face

01:16:27.930 --> 01:16:30.280
in addition to all the others is that

01:16:31.350 --> 01:16:35.033
the catastrophe in Libya
has more or less left R2P

01:16:36.480 --> 01:16:40.260
in tatters internationally.

01:16:40.260 --> 01:16:43.170
It'd be very difficult to do this again.

01:16:43.170 --> 01:16:48.070
And America has greatly
diminished its capacity to act

01:16:48.070 --> 01:16:49.863
throughout the Middle East.

01:16:51.370 --> 01:16:55.090
I'm seeing Russia has
expanded to fill the vacuum,

01:16:55.090 --> 01:17:00.090
and that is the sort of big
geopolitical story is that

01:17:00.150 --> 01:17:02.800
capacity to be influential in the region

01:17:02.800 --> 01:17:07.610
is much less than it was the
day before George W. Bush

01:17:07.610 --> 01:17:12.610
intervened in Iraq in March of 2003.

01:17:13.520 --> 01:17:16.920
So it's in that sense a
big withdrawal by the US,

01:17:16.920 --> 01:17:19.410
and Russia filling the void.

01:17:19.410 --> 01:17:24.090
We will see on Tuesday
another kind of withdrawal

01:17:24.090 --> 01:17:26.573
by the US that has been,

01:17:27.470 --> 01:17:31.110
had other forms of void being filled,

01:17:31.110 --> 01:17:35.150
particularly with China's
involvement in Africa.

01:17:35.150 --> 01:17:36.353
We'll see you then.

01:17:37.738 --> 01:17:40.155

WAI CHEE DIMOCK: I'd like
to refresh your

00:00:11.567 --> 00:00:14.433
memories by going
back to talk

00:00:14.433 --> 00:00:19.267
briefly about the two classes
last week on Faulkner.

00:00:19.267 --> 00:00:25.333
And we looked at Faulkner's
remark at the Nagano Seminar

00:00:25.333 --> 00:00:30.767
in Japan, when he claimed that
The Sound and the Fury is the

00:00:30.767 --> 00:00:34.067
same story told four times.

00:00:34.067 --> 00:00:38.733
So in light of that claim, we
looked at the relation between

00:00:38.733 --> 00:00:42.967
Benjy and Quentin as a relation

00:00:42.967 --> 00:00:45.433
of kinship and variation.

00:00:45.433 --> 00:00:50.167
The two of them are obviously
brothers, but they can also be

00:00:50.167 --> 00:00:55.767
seen as brothers in more than
just a biological sense.

00:00:55.767 --> 00:01:01.467
So let's think about kinship
and variation as the most

00:01:01.467 --> 00:01:06.167
fundamental structure of
The Sound and the Fury.

00:01:06.167 --> 00:01:11.733
And so far, what we can see is
that this structure of kinship

00:01:11.733 --> 00:01:17.267
and variation is pivoted on some
kind of battle with time.

00:01:17.267 --> 00:01:23.333
As we know, Benjy wants Caddy
never to grow up.

00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:28.100
He wants her always to be an
innocent young girl, never to

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.500
become a woman.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.267
He wants her always to "smell
like trees." That's the

00:01:33.267 --> 00:01:36.400
signature line from Benjy.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.333
In many ways, it is
a battle for an

00:01:39.333 --> 00:01:44.267
impossible, unchanging
innocence.

00:01:44.267 --> 00:01:48.867
And we know that the nature of
the battle is such that Benjy

00:01:48.867 --> 00:01:51.267
is destined to be a loser.

00:01:51.267 --> 00:01:54.633
There's no way he can
win that battle.

00:01:54.633 --> 00:01:57.500
But we also know that the very
fact that this is an

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.333
impossible battle, that Benjy
is destined to be a loser,

00:02:02.333 --> 00:02:04.867
also means that it's going
to be a narrative

00:02:04.867 --> 00:02:06.467
challenge for Faulkner.

00:02:06.467 --> 00:02:08.967
He has to do something
for the loser.

00:02:08.967 --> 00:02:11.267
If you are a good author,
you want to do

00:02:11.267 --> 00:02:12.900
something for the loser.

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.367
And so one of the challenges for
Faulkner in The Sound and

00:02:15.367 --> 00:02:19.100
the Fury is to do something
for Benjy.

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.333
If we turn to Quentin, we see
pretty much the same pattern

00:02:23.333 --> 00:02:26.567
repeated, the same
battle with time.

00:02:26.567 --> 00:02:33.400
Quentin is exactly like Benjy
in that he also wants Caddy

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.567
never to grow up.

00:02:34.567 --> 00:02:37.267
He wants her always to be an
innocent young girl, never to

00:02:37.267 --> 00:02:41.533
become a grown woman with
her own sexuality.

00:02:41.533 --> 00:02:44.900
And so in that way, it's an
almost complete replay of that

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.333
impossible demand from Benjy.

00:02:48.333 --> 00:02:52.967
But Quentin has an additional
battle with time, a more

00:02:52.967 --> 00:02:54.500
abstract battle.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.167
And we see that in the opening
of the Quentin section, he

00:02:59.167 --> 00:03:04.933
takes out his watch, he smashes
the crystal, and then

00:03:04.933 --> 00:03:11.133
he twists off the hands
of the watch.

00:03:11.133 --> 00:03:14.100
And he injures his hand
in the process.

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.967
So right then, we know
that it's a losing

00:03:16.967 --> 00:03:18.933
battle for him too.

00:03:18.933 --> 00:03:22.133
But he twists off the hands
of the watch, and

00:03:22.133 --> 00:03:24.467
the watch ticks on.

00:03:24.467 --> 00:03:29.067
That's a little local allegory
for the entire course of

00:03:29.067 --> 00:03:30.700
Quentin's section.

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.433
So at the end of Quentin's
section, we know that the most

00:03:34.433 --> 00:03:39.033
offending word, and that he
calls the saddest word of all,

00:03:39.033 --> 00:03:44.100
is the word "temporary." And
by "temporary," he has one

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.933
particular context in mind.

00:03:46.933 --> 00:03:49.067
His tragedy, as we have
seen, is basically

00:03:49.067 --> 00:03:50.567
a secondhand tragedy.

00:03:50.567 --> 00:03:52.533
It is not his own tragedy.

00:03:52.533 --> 00:03:57.533
It is the secondhand tragedy of
Caddy losing her virginity.

00:03:57.533 --> 00:04:03.800
But Quentin is embracing it
as his own tragedy and is

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:10.067
basically finishing, wrapping
up his life as a response to

00:04:10.067 --> 00:04:11.200
that tragedy.

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.633
But the fear is that that
tragedy is going to pass, that

00:04:15.633 --> 00:04:18.967
it's not going to be a permanent
tragedy for him.

00:04:18.967 --> 00:04:20.667
Everything is temporary.

00:04:20.667 --> 00:04:24.033
Even the sense of devastation
will go away.

00:04:24.033 --> 00:04:28.433
So because "temporary" is the
saddest word of all, the only

00:04:28.433 --> 00:04:33.267
way Quentin can get around
that word is to have a

00:04:33.267 --> 00:04:36.767
preemptive strike against
that word.

00:04:36.767 --> 00:04:42.633
His suicide is a preemptive
strike against the word

00:04:42.633 --> 00:04:46.333
"temporary," so that it will
have an artificial permanence

00:04:46.333 --> 00:04:49.833
in his own life, because his
life is ended at that moment,

00:04:49.833 --> 00:04:53.000
and there's no possibility for
it to fade away, to become

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.667
less devastating.

00:04:55.667 --> 00:05:03.400
So in those ways, Benjy and
Quentin are very much brothers

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:09.867
in a spiritual sense, a
metaphoric battle with time.

00:05:09.867 --> 00:05:12.033
Today, we'll move on to Jason.

00:05:12.033 --> 00:05:15.933
And it's a bigger challenge to
think of Jason as the brother

00:05:15.933 --> 00:05:19.367
to Quentin and Benjy.

00:05:19.367 --> 00:05:22.033
Jason seems very, very different
on the face of it.

00:05:22.033 --> 00:05:28.667
But I'd like to suggest that in
at least one way, Jason can

00:05:28.667 --> 00:05:34.733
be seen as a brother to Benjy
and Quentin, in that he also

00:05:34.733 --> 00:05:37.867
has his own battle with time.

00:05:37.867 --> 00:05:42.333
And it is a battle
with a larger

00:05:42.333 --> 00:05:44.000
constellation of forces.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.800
So we are seeing scale
enlargement in a very

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:52.533
significant way in the
Jason section.

00:05:52.533 --> 00:05:56.300
We're seeing a much bigger
picture of the United States.

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:02.367
And that scale enlargement has
to do with a tug of war

00:06:02.367 --> 00:06:07.233
between the yesterday of the
United States and the tomorrow

00:06:07.233 --> 00:06:11.700
of the United States and Jason
wanting very much to cling to

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:13.133
the yesterday.

00:06:13.133 --> 00:06:16.267
It's more congenial to
him in every way.

00:06:16.267 --> 00:06:18.000
But at the same time,
he knows that the

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.600
tomorrow is already here.

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:23.733
In fact, the tomorrow is
encroaching on the present.

00:06:23.733 --> 00:06:25.367
There's nothing he
can do about it.

00:06:25.367 --> 00:06:28.600
He just has to learn to cope
with that tomorrow, very

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:31.933
uncongenial, very threatening
tomorrow.

00:06:31.933 --> 00:06:34.233
He has to learn to come
to terms with that.

00:06:34.233 --> 00:06:38.933
So the basic dynamic of Jason's
section is the battle

00:06:38.933 --> 00:06:41.800
between yesterday
and tomorrow.

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:45.133
And I think that we know that
it pretty much is a losing

00:06:45.133 --> 00:06:48.333
battle for Jason as well.

00:06:48.333 --> 00:06:51.500
Because we're talking so much
about yesterday and tomorrow,

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:55.000
I want to bring back that very
important passage from

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.567
Macbeth, Act V, Scene 5, that
Faulkner took the phrase "the

00:07:00.567 --> 00:07:01.767
sound and the fury" from.

00:07:01.767 --> 00:07:06.400
"Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and
tomorrow, creeps in this petty

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:09.500
pace from day to
day to the last

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:12.433
syllable of recorded time.

00:07:12.433 --> 00:07:15.567
And all our yesterdays have
lighted fools the

00:07:15.567 --> 00:07:17.367
way to dusty death.

00:07:17.367 --> 00:07:20.233
It is a tale told by an idiot,
full of sound and fury,

00:07:20.233 --> 00:07:21.967
signifying nothing."

00:07:21.967 --> 00:07:24.167
So Faulkner is really
getting the maximum

00:07:24.167 --> 00:07:26.800
mileage from that passage.

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:30.533
He's really taking out the
entire scaffolding of his

00:07:30.533 --> 00:07:34.767
novel from that Shakespeare
passage.

00:07:34.767 --> 00:07:38.600
And I'd like to give you a brief
overview of the basic

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:43.500
structure of today's lecture,
the various terms that come

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:45.967
into play in this tug
of war between

00:07:45.967 --> 00:07:47.867
yesterday and tomorrow.

00:07:47.867 --> 00:07:52.967
We know that the horse is
actually still a presence in

00:07:52.967 --> 00:07:54.033
The Sound and the Fury.

00:07:54.033 --> 00:07:58.100
Queenie, the horse, will have
a starring role at the very

00:07:58.100 --> 00:07:59.467
end of the novel.

00:07:59.467 --> 00:08:02.400
We don't see her quite in the
foreground yet, but I promise

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:04.567
you she'll have a
starring role.

00:08:04.567 --> 00:08:08.567
We know that the automobile
is very much here.

00:08:08.567 --> 00:08:11.767
And I would like to think of
those, the horse and the

00:08:11.767 --> 00:08:16.200
automobile, as two directional
arrows.

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:22.633
So the horse is a vector, is a
directional arrow pointing

00:08:22.633 --> 00:08:27.067
back to the 19th century, a very
genteel world where to

00:08:27.067 --> 00:08:31.900
own a horse makes you a part
of the gentry as well as

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:36.133
civility of social
distinctions.

00:08:36.133 --> 00:08:40.100
The automobile, as we already
have seen in The Great Gatsby,

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:43.233
is a vehicle that to some
extent breaks down or

00:08:43.233 --> 00:08:45.900
complicates social
distinctions.

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:48.067
It also brings in strangers.

00:08:48.067 --> 00:08:51.933
So the phrase that I would like
to use to think about

00:08:51.933 --> 00:08:57.000
that transition from the past to
the present is the concept

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000
that I'm taking from the
literary and cultural critic

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.333
Raymond Williams, the notion of
the knowable community and

00:09:05.333 --> 00:09:08.700
how that's receding into the
past, that's breaking down to

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:12.733
be replaced by an unknowable
world of strangers.

00:09:12.733 --> 00:09:18.467
And on that basis, I'll talk
about the basic structure,

00:09:18.467 --> 00:09:22.033
really, in the Jason section as
two patterns of grievances,

00:09:22.033 --> 00:09:23.633
two patterns of injury.

00:09:23.633 --> 00:09:26.467
As we know, Jason is someone who
feels grief all the time.

00:09:26.467 --> 00:09:29.133
He feels that the whole
world has done him an

00:09:29.133 --> 00:09:31.133
unpardonable wrong.

00:09:31.133 --> 00:09:32.833
So he's complaining
all the time.

00:09:32.833 --> 00:09:34.667
That's his mode.

00:09:34.667 --> 00:09:39.033
But given that this is the
baseline for Jason, he has two

00:09:39.033 --> 00:09:43.267
different parties, two different
kinds of people,

00:09:43.267 --> 00:09:46.067
that he's complaining about.

00:09:46.067 --> 00:09:49.433
One is the known parties,
people in his immediate

00:09:49.433 --> 00:09:52.067
environment, people he
knows very well.

00:09:52.067 --> 00:09:54.300
And then there are total
strangers who are also doing

00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:56.733
him a wrong, that he knows
nothing about, but he's

00:09:56.733 --> 00:09:59.433
convinced are out to get him.

00:09:59.433 --> 00:10:03.767
So the notion that there are
strangers somewhere to get you

00:10:03.767 --> 00:10:07.200
versus people right here
who are doing you in

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:09.300
right on the spot.

00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:13.133
And so the people who are right
there are his family,

00:10:13.133 --> 00:10:16.833
his servants, his father,
his niece, Quentin.

00:10:16.833 --> 00:10:20.400
And the unknown parties include
the usual suspects,

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:24.633
New York Jew, US government,
Western Union Telegraph, and

00:10:24.633 --> 00:10:26.367
of course Wall Street.

00:10:26.367 --> 00:10:27.500
So very familiar.

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:30.067
Again, very close
to us, actually.

00:10:30.067 --> 00:10:36.500
But this is the image that
I find in some sense is a

00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:41.000
capsule summary of the dynamics
in the Jason section.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.167
You see the horse and cart, the
nineteenth-century relic,

00:10:45.167 --> 00:10:48.933
and then the automobile
coming right--

00:10:48.933 --> 00:10:51.533
almost going to run
it over, we fear.

00:10:51.533 --> 00:10:56.400
And that's the situation that
we get in The Sound and the

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:59.133
Fury in the Jason section.

00:10:59.133 --> 00:11:04.833
We know that Jason actually is
part of the future, he's part

00:11:04.833 --> 00:11:08.067
of tomorrow, in the sense
that he owns a car.

00:11:08.067 --> 00:11:09.367
And he's very proud.

00:11:09.367 --> 00:11:13.433
He's seen in his car a lot, and
he's very proud that his

00:11:13.433 --> 00:11:16.400
is a relatively expensive car.

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:16.967
It's not a Ford.

00:11:16.967 --> 00:11:19.567
He makes a point that there are
people who own Fords, but

00:11:19.567 --> 00:11:20.467
his car is not a Ford.

00:11:20.467 --> 00:11:23.300
We don't know what kind of a
car he has, but it's a car

00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:27.133
that he's proud of and he
spends a lot of time in.

00:11:27.133 --> 00:11:32.967
But there's a basic
incompatibility between Jason

00:11:32.967 --> 00:11:34.100
and his car.

00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:37.967
And this comes back to
the Compson curse.

00:11:37.967 --> 00:11:43.467
It turns out that Jason's
faculty of smell is as highly

00:11:43.467 --> 00:11:45.833
developed as his
two brothers'.

00:11:45.833 --> 00:11:49.700
In his case, the smell that gets
to him isn't the smell of

00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:52.800
trees or the smell of
honeysuckle but

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:54.500
the smell of gasoline.

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:57.367
He can't stand the smell
of gasoline.

00:11:57.367 --> 00:11:59.567
It gives him a tremendous
headache.

00:11:59.567 --> 00:12:04.467
The only way he can drive is
by putting a handkerchief

00:12:04.467 --> 00:12:06.133
soaked in camphor
over his nose.

00:12:06.133 --> 00:12:08.500
That's the only way he can
drive his own car.

00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:15.900
So this is his complaint about
this vehicle that belongs to

00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:19.867
him, that he wouldn't dream of
getting rid of, but is a

00:12:19.867 --> 00:12:22.100
burden to him.

00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:26.333
"And now I reckon I'll get home
just in time to take a

00:12:26.333 --> 00:12:31.267
nice long drive after a basket
of tomatoes or something and

00:12:31.267 --> 00:12:34.167
then have to go back to town
smelling like a camphor

00:12:34.167 --> 00:12:39.633
factory so my head won't explode
right on my shoulders.

00:12:39.633 --> 00:12:42.600
I says, you don't know
what a headache is.

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:45.800
I says, you think I'd fool with
that damn car at all if

00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:47.100
it depended on me?"

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:51.033
Of course, he's complaining that
it's not by choice that

00:12:51.033 --> 00:12:54.067
he's in this car, but we
also know that he's

00:12:54.067 --> 00:12:55.500
proud of his car.

00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:59.267
So this is just to
lay out a basic

00:12:59.267 --> 00:13:02.133
difficulty in Jason's situation.

00:13:02.133 --> 00:13:07.000
It's that there's a tension,
a conflict between his own

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.933
physical well being and the most
basic ingredient of an

00:13:11.933 --> 00:13:17.167
automobile, of structural
incompatibility between Jason

00:13:17.167 --> 00:13:20.900
as a biological human being
and the mechanical

00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:23.367
workings of a car.

00:13:23.367 --> 00:13:27.367
But beyond that, there's also
something else that makes the

00:13:27.367 --> 00:13:33.867
automobile a terrible threat to
Jason, which is the kinds

00:13:33.867 --> 00:13:37.967
of people who come
with automobiles.

00:13:37.967 --> 00:13:42.100
And already, we're beginning
to see a world of strangers

00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:47.067
opening up right there in
Jefferson, Mississippi.

00:13:47.067 --> 00:13:49.433
So here's Jason.

00:13:49.433 --> 00:13:54.400
"I had just turned onto the
street when I saw a Ford

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:57.200
coming helling toward me.

00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:59.633
All of a sudden, it stopped.

00:13:59.633 --> 00:14:02.733
I could hear the wheels sliding,
and it slewed around

00:14:02.733 --> 00:14:04.833
and backed and whirled.

00:14:04.833 --> 00:14:08.500
And just as I was thinking what
the hell they were up to,

00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:10.433
I saw that red tie.

00:14:10.433 --> 00:14:13.133
Then I recognized
her face looking

00:14:13.133 --> 00:14:15.033
back through the window.

00:14:15.033 --> 00:14:16.300
I saw red.

00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:20.500
When I recognized that red tie,
after all I had told her,

00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:22.067
I forgot about everything.

00:14:22.067 --> 00:14:25.000
I never thought about my head,
even, until I came to the

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.733
first forks and had to stop.

00:14:26.733 --> 00:14:29.767
Yet we spend money and spend
money on roads, and damn if it

00:14:29.767 --> 00:14:33.033
isn't like trying to drive over
a sheet of corrugated

00:14:33.033 --> 00:14:34.533
iron roofing.

00:14:34.533 --> 00:14:37.033
I would like to know how a man
could be expected to keep up

00:14:37.033 --> 00:14:39.767
with even a wheelbarrow."

00:14:39.767 --> 00:14:45.167
In the space of two paragraphs,
we see that Jason

00:14:45.167 --> 00:14:50.333
has shifted his attention from
his niece, Quentin, to the

00:14:50.333 --> 00:14:53.600
government who's not keeping
up the roads.

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:58.067
So the first thing that we can
say about this passage is that

00:14:58.067 --> 00:15:02.400
the word "temporary" isn't
just a curse for Quentin.

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:05.467
It is also a curse for Jason.

00:15:05.467 --> 00:15:08.533
He has a very short
attention span.

00:15:08.533 --> 00:15:12.267
He can't really keep his mind
fixed on the thing that he's

00:15:12.267 --> 00:15:15.200
going to complain against.

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:17.533
And that's just a
little aside.

00:15:17.533 --> 00:15:21.000
It's not something that
Jason himself notices.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.433
But we can say that for him.

00:15:24.433 --> 00:15:28.200
That's one strike against him in
his battle with time, that

00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:30.933
he has such a short attention
span and that he can't hold

00:15:30.933 --> 00:15:34.167
onto what little time that he
has, or that he can't make

00:15:34.167 --> 00:15:36.400
that time last longer,
can't make his

00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:38.267
grievance last longer.

00:15:38.267 --> 00:15:41.567
So not being able to make
something last longer is one

00:15:41.567 --> 00:15:45.967
of the problems with Jason.

00:15:45.967 --> 00:15:49.667
And that's a long-term, generic,
constitutional

00:15:49.667 --> 00:15:51.467
problem for Jason.

00:15:51.467 --> 00:15:55.667
But the most immediate problem
for him is that his niece,

00:15:55.667 --> 00:15:58.767
Quentin, the daughter of Caddy,
is running around with

00:15:58.767 --> 00:16:00.767
total strangers.

00:16:00.767 --> 00:16:03.067
And we don't know
who this man is.

00:16:03.067 --> 00:16:06.433
Jason is not telling us, because
he doesn't know.

00:16:06.433 --> 00:16:10.533
All he can see is that this is a
man with a red tie, and that

00:16:10.533 --> 00:16:13.967
tells him that this man is
no good and that Quentin

00:16:13.967 --> 00:16:18.333
shouldn't be hanging out with
this man wearing a red tie.

00:16:18.333 --> 00:16:21.500
And he comes with a car
that's a relatively--

00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:25.000
I don't myself consider a Ford
a cheap car, but Jason

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.167
considers it a cheap car, and
therefore that's another

00:16:27.167 --> 00:16:29.867
strike against the stranger
that he's no good.

00:16:29.867 --> 00:16:33.400
In the next-- so this
is on Page 238--

00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:37.067
next page, we know who
this stranger is.

00:16:37.067 --> 00:16:40.800
Not really what kind of a person
he is, but what kind of

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:44.400
occupation he has.

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:48.367
"I says, as far as I'm
concerned, let her go to hell

00:16:48.367 --> 00:16:52.267
as fast as she pleases, and
the sooner the better.

00:16:52.267 --> 00:16:55.133
I says, what else do you expect
except every damn

00:16:55.133 --> 00:17:00.333
drummer and cheap show that
comes to town, because even

00:17:00.333 --> 00:17:04.100
those town jellybeans give
her the go-by now."

00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:09.833
And that shows how far the
Compson fortune has fallen

00:17:09.833 --> 00:17:13.467
from being the town gentry.

00:17:13.467 --> 00:17:16.433
Quentin has fallen so low
that even the town

00:17:16.433 --> 00:17:19.533
jellybeans won't touch her.

00:17:19.533 --> 00:17:23.100
The only way she can have some
company is to hang out with

00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:27.467
strangers coming to town
for the first time.

00:17:27.467 --> 00:17:29.633
Cheap shows --

00:17:29.633 --> 00:17:33.133
it's confusing to see the
drummer in the context of a

00:17:33.133 --> 00:17:34.067
cheap show.

00:17:34.067 --> 00:17:36.867
We might think that the drummer
is someone who plays

00:17:36.867 --> 00:17:42.233
the drums. But actually, no,
this is a specialized, late

00:17:42.233 --> 00:17:44.400
nineteenth-century, turn
of the century, early

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:50.267
twentieth-century slang word
for the traveling salesman.

00:17:50.267 --> 00:17:57.167
So Jason is using that very
distinct period usage.

00:17:57.167 --> 00:17:57.867
The drummer --

00:17:57.867 --> 00:17:59.833
this is a traveling salesman.

00:17:59.833 --> 00:18:04.033
We know that he's going to be
there probably just for a day

00:18:04.033 --> 00:18:07.733
to keep Quentin company,
and then he'll be gone.

00:18:07.733 --> 00:18:15.667
So Jason in that way is an entry
point for us to that

00:18:15.667 --> 00:18:20.033
nineteenth-century world,
the changing world of

00:18:20.033 --> 00:18:21.967
salesmanship, of marketing.

00:18:21.967 --> 00:18:26.133
That's very important, that we
have traveling salesmen who

00:18:26.133 --> 00:18:29.100
drive around in cars,

00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:31.500
fast-living traveling salesmen.

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:35.200
All of those are new
developments.

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:41.767
And the other thing we can say
about this drummer is that

00:18:41.767 --> 00:18:45.967
he's known to Jason, to the
extent that he is known at

00:18:45.967 --> 00:18:50.833
all, primarily because
of two attributes.

00:18:50.833 --> 00:18:56.467
One is the thing that stands out
from him, is the fact that

00:18:56.467 --> 00:18:58.300
he's wearing a red tie.

00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:00.733
That's a giveaway for Jason.

00:19:00.733 --> 00:19:05.267
And the other thing is that
his occupation is

00:19:05.267 --> 00:19:07.400
written on his face.

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:13.333
The fact that he's a traveling
salesman is clear just from--

00:19:13.333 --> 00:19:16.367
anyone can see that
that's what he is.

00:19:16.367 --> 00:19:21.100
So Jason's knowledge of the
drummer doesn't extend

00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:22.167
further than that.

00:19:22.167 --> 00:19:28.400
It is a very superficial
knowledge of this man.

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:31.367
Not because Jason doesn't want
to know him-- well, maybe

00:19:31.367 --> 00:19:32.333
Jason doesn't--

00:19:32.333 --> 00:19:37.700
in any case, that knowledge will
never extend further than

00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:42.400
the color of his tie and
occupational label that Jason

00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:44.233
can pin on him.

00:19:44.233 --> 00:19:49.200
It is a world that is by
definition made up of our

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:52.800
superficial knowledge of total
strangers, people we see once

00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:54.300
and never again.

00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:59.533
That is the world that is
opening up in front of Jason.

00:19:59.533 --> 00:20:02.833
We can decide whether or
not this is a world

00:20:02.833 --> 00:20:05.067
that we like or not.

00:20:05.067 --> 00:20:06.067
We have no choice.

00:20:06.067 --> 00:20:08.767
I think that this is also the
world that we are in.

00:20:08.767 --> 00:20:11.933
Quite often, most of the people
that we meet actually

00:20:11.933 --> 00:20:15.133
are people we see once and never
again, that we know just

00:20:15.133 --> 00:20:18.500
by those two attributes, what
kind of clothes they wear and

00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:22.133
our surmises as to what kind of
occupations they have. So

00:20:22.133 --> 00:20:25.533
Jason's tomorrow is in many
ways our present.

00:20:25.533 --> 00:20:34.000
And here, I want to mention the
work of one of my heroes,

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:39.933
really, Raymond Williams, a very
influential literary and

00:20:39.933 --> 00:20:41.700
cultural critic.

00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:44.800
He died some time ago.

00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:52.867
His classic work, The Country
and the City, in that work,

00:20:52.867 --> 00:20:57.733
Raymond Williams coins the
phrase "knowable communities."

00:20:57.733 --> 00:21:01.233
In fact, one of the chapters
of the book is called

00:21:01.233 --> 00:21:02.900
"Knowable Communities."

00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:07.800
And this is what Raymond
Williams says.

00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:13.467
"A country community, most
typically a village, is an

00:21:13.467 --> 00:21:18.300
epitome of direct relationships,
of face-to-face

00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:24.700
contacts within which we can
find and value the substance

00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:27.733
of personal relationships.

00:21:27.733 --> 00:21:33.267
As the scale and complexity of
the characteristic social

00:21:33.267 --> 00:21:38.033
organizations increase, a
whole community, wholly

00:21:38.033 --> 00:21:43.033
knowable, becomes harder
and harder to sustain."

00:21:43.033 --> 00:21:49.000
So Raymond Williams' idea is
that modernity is defined by

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:55.167
the breakdown of that
unsustainable utopian ideal,

00:21:55.167 --> 00:21:57.767
knowable communities.

00:21:57.767 --> 00:22:02.133
And he really reads
almost all--

00:22:02.133 --> 00:22:05.767
he was English, so he reads
almost all of English

00:22:05.767 --> 00:22:11.200
literature using that concept,
and I'm extending his insight

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:13.000
to American literature.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.800
And here I want to stop very
briefly and say a word about

00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:16.533
plagiarism.

00:22:16.533 --> 00:22:20.667
I know that the first paper
is coming up for you guys.

00:22:20.667 --> 00:22:24.367
And I just want to emphasize
how important it is to

00:22:24.367 --> 00:22:28.533
acknowledge where you're getting
your ideas, where

00:22:28.533 --> 00:22:30.767
you're getting your
wording from.

00:22:30.767 --> 00:22:33.733
"Knowable community" is a phrase
that I could have made

00:22:33.733 --> 00:22:40.367
up myself, but it is really
important to acknowledge the

00:22:40.367 --> 00:22:44.567
book or the article that you
got the concept from.

00:22:44.567 --> 00:22:47.033
Very, very important
for two reasons.

00:22:47.033 --> 00:22:51.500
One is that it is just a
courtesy, needed recognition

00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:54.000
to the person who came
up with the idea.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:55.800
If you were to come up with
a great phrase, you'd want

00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:57.733
people to acknowledge you.

00:22:57.733 --> 00:23:01.400
But I think that more than that,
I think that citational

00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:04.800
practices are not just a
technicality, are not just a

00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:06.467
way to get ourselves
out of trouble.

00:23:06.467 --> 00:23:09.800
It is a way to show that we're
in dialogue with someone else.

00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:13.467
And because Raymond Williams
is such a hero for me, I

00:23:13.467 --> 00:23:17.633
actually take a lot of pleasure
in thinking that even

00:23:17.633 --> 00:23:21.100
though he didn't write about
Faulkner, that actually his

00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:23.733
insights apply so well
to Faulkner.

00:23:23.733 --> 00:23:29.733
So it is the pleasure of having
a long and extended

00:23:29.733 --> 00:23:35.367
conversation with people that
you admire, whose work you

00:23:35.367 --> 00:23:36.700
enjoy reading.

00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:41.867
So for both those two reasons,
please acknowledge where

00:23:41.867 --> 00:23:44.500
you're getting your
ideas from.

00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:48.800
So using Raymond Williams'
idea of the knowable

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:57.467
community, I want to think about
Jason's structure of

00:23:57.467 --> 00:24:00.767
injury, his pattern of injury.

00:24:00.767 --> 00:24:04.467
And I'll be looking at two
passages that suggest that

00:24:04.467 --> 00:24:08.833
he's still in a knowable
community, and then we'll move

00:24:08.833 --> 00:24:13.567
on to that much more pressing,
the world is going to win out,

00:24:13.567 --> 00:24:16.900
the world that is made up
of unknowable strangers.

00:24:16.900 --> 00:24:20.567
But first, knowable community
based on Jefferson,

00:24:20.567 --> 00:24:21.833
Mississippi.

00:24:23.567 --> 00:24:26.000
This is Jason at breakfast.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:29.967
"Once a bitch, always
a bitch, what I say.

00:24:29.967 --> 00:24:34.200
I says, you're lucky if her
playing out of school is all

00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:35.800
that worries you.

00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:40.333
I says, she ought to be down
there in that kitchen right

00:24:40.333 --> 00:24:43.967
now instead of up there in her
room, gobbing paint on her

00:24:43.967 --> 00:24:47.533
face, and waiting for six
niggers that can't even stand

00:24:47.533 --> 00:24:51.000
up out of a chair unless they've
got a pan full of

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:54.067
bread and meat to balance them,
to fix breakfast for

00:24:54.067 --> 00:24:54.633
her."

00:24:54.633 --> 00:24:59.067
So one of the basic problems
for Jason that we noticed

00:24:59.067 --> 00:25:03.333
earlier, the very short
attention span, is very much

00:25:03.333 --> 00:25:04.833
in evidence here.

00:25:04.833 --> 00:25:09.133
He starts off complaining
against his niece, Quentin.

00:25:09.133 --> 00:25:11.267
By the end of that passage,
he's complaining about the

00:25:11.267 --> 00:25:13.433
"niggers" in his household.

00:25:13.433 --> 00:25:16.300
So he can't hold onto a
grievance for very long.

00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:20.067
The word "temporary" is
definitely a curse for him.

00:25:20.067 --> 00:25:24.500
But even though the word
"temporary" is a curse for

00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:28.033
Jason, he actually aspires
to permanence.

00:25:28.033 --> 00:25:32.300
And we see that in the opening
line of that passage, "Once a

00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:35.833
bitch, always a a bitch."
It is not a proverb.

00:25:35.833 --> 00:25:39.200
There's no such proverb
in the world.

00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:43.267
But it has the feel
of a proverb.

00:25:43.267 --> 00:25:47.167
It has the feel of a
proverb-like permanence.

00:25:47.167 --> 00:25:52.567
And this is the small-town Jason
who is speaking, finding

00:25:52.567 --> 00:25:56.433
enormous satisfaction from
making pronouncements that

00:25:56.433 --> 00:25:58.667
sound like proverbs.

00:25:58.667 --> 00:26:03.667
This is his take on the world,
and he's able to sum up the

00:26:03.667 --> 00:26:09.467
entire world just using
seven words.

00:26:09.467 --> 00:26:12.100
You can't really do better
than that, a seven-word

00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:13.933
summation of the entire world.

00:26:13.933 --> 00:26:15.767
So just enormous satisfaction.

00:26:15.767 --> 00:26:19.967
So we can say that even though
Jason is complaining nonstop,

00:26:19.967 --> 00:26:25.100
even though that's his mode,
this is one instance where

00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:29.467
complaining is actually
a very pleasurable

00:26:29.467 --> 00:26:31.833
activity for Jason.

00:26:31.833 --> 00:26:34.600
He's getting a kick being able
to say that his niece is a

00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:37.333
bitch, and she'll
always be one.

00:26:37.333 --> 00:26:41.167
And he's getting a kick out of
talking about the thickness of

00:26:41.167 --> 00:26:45.900
her makeup, and everything that
is objectionable about

00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:48.800
her gives him enormous
pleasure.

00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:56.133
So complaining in a world
of known quantities--

00:26:56.133 --> 00:27:01.433
and Quentin is very much a
known quantity to Jason--

00:27:01.433 --> 00:27:04.667
complaining about people right
around you, people in your

00:27:04.667 --> 00:27:07.467
immediate family, that's a
really fun thing to do.

00:27:07.467 --> 00:27:09.633
And Jason is having
fun doing that.

00:27:09.633 --> 00:27:13.100
He's having fun complaining
about the black servants.

00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:19.300
And in his mind, as far as he's
concerned, Quentin, his

00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:23.067
niece, and those black servants
are exactly alike.

00:27:23.067 --> 00:27:24.867
They are all good for nothing.

00:27:24.867 --> 00:27:27.567
They are all a trial for him.

00:27:27.567 --> 00:27:30.600
They're all wronging him
in some fashion.

00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:33.667
They're a drain on his financial
resources, a drain

00:27:33.667 --> 00:27:35.533
on his patience.

00:27:35.533 --> 00:27:37.967
It's just a burden that he has
to carry through life, that he

00:27:37.967 --> 00:27:41.233
happens to have a niece
like that and to have

00:27:41.233 --> 00:27:41.767
servants like that.

00:27:41.767 --> 00:27:43.200
And he can go on and on.

00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:45.167
He can go on all
day like this.

00:27:45.167 --> 00:27:48.333
And it would be a very happy
life for him to be able to go

00:27:48.333 --> 00:27:49.633
on like that.

00:27:49.633 --> 00:27:52.367
So this is the pleasure
that one gets

00:27:52.367 --> 00:27:54.900
from a knowable community.

00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:59.400
And I'll just give you another
instance of that, very much in

00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:00.700
the same vein.

00:28:02.933 --> 00:28:07.767
"Like I say, if he had to sell
something to send Quentin to

00:28:07.767 --> 00:28:12.333
Harvard, we'd all be a damn
sight better off if he'd sold

00:28:12.333 --> 00:28:16.100
that sideboard and bought
himself a one-armed

00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:19.233
straitjacket with part
of the money.

00:28:19.233 --> 00:28:23.200
I reckon the reason all the
Compson gave out before it got

00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:27.933
to me, like Mother says,
is that he drank it up.

00:28:27.933 --> 00:28:31.133
At least I never heard of him
offering to sell anything to

00:28:31.133 --> 00:28:33.833
send me to Harvard."

00:28:33.833 --> 00:28:36.267
So two complaints here,
both centered on

00:28:36.267 --> 00:28:38.700
his father, Mr. Compson.

00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:40.400
One is that his father drinks.

00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:51.200
And in fact it is true that
one of the many metaphoric

00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:55.167
punctuation marks in The Sound
and the Fury, Mr. Compson

00:28:55.167 --> 00:29:00.400
making the trips to the
sideboard to get the booze,

00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:03.400
that's one of the punctuation
marks in The

00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:04.600
Sound and the Fury.

00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:08.767
So Jason isn't wrong that his
father drinks and probably is

00:29:08.767 --> 00:29:12.900
squandering away the whole
Compson fortune, to the extent

00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:14.733
that there is one now.

00:29:14.733 --> 00:29:18.067
He's squandering away the whole
fortune by drinking, so

00:29:18.067 --> 00:29:20.933
Jason has a legitimate
complaint.

00:29:20.933 --> 00:29:26.600
But a deeper complaint that goes
along with the fact that

00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:32.633
his father drinks is that
Quentin, his brother, was his

00:29:32.633 --> 00:29:39.233
father's favorite, that his
father, as much as he loves

00:29:39.233 --> 00:29:45.333
drinking, he probably
loved Quentin better

00:29:45.333 --> 00:29:47.200
than he loved alcohol.

00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:50.933
And he would go so far as to
sell the pastures, Benjy's

00:29:50.933 --> 00:29:54.033
pastures, so that Quentin
would go to Harvard.

00:29:54.033 --> 00:29:56.233
Of course, he killed himself
after one year, so all of the

00:29:56.233 --> 00:30:01.067
money was wasted, and that is
just even more grounds for

00:30:01.067 --> 00:30:05.133
complaint for Jason.

00:30:05.133 --> 00:30:10.333
Once again, I have to say, it's
a very understandable

00:30:10.333 --> 00:30:14.467
grievance, the sense of not
being loved, the sense that

00:30:14.467 --> 00:30:17.800
nobody has ever done anything
for him, that everything that

00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:22.733
could be done in that family
was being done for Quentin,

00:30:22.733 --> 00:30:23.967
who wasted everything.

00:30:27.067 --> 00:30:29.433
I wouldn't say it's a completely
legitimate

00:30:29.433 --> 00:30:33.333
grievance, but it's a very
understandable grievance of

00:30:33.333 --> 00:30:36.233
why he's someone that
nobody thinks about.

00:30:36.233 --> 00:30:41.033
Nobody ever gives a thought to
the well-being of Jason.

00:30:41.033 --> 00:30:44.100
And what kind of a monster do
you get when nobody ever gives

00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:46.400
a thought to his well-being?

00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:49.467
So in many ways, Faulkner--

00:30:49.467 --> 00:30:52.100
and I'm just preparing you for
the ending of The Sound and

00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:54.533
the Fury, where I do think that
even though Jason is a

00:30:54.533 --> 00:30:59.200
loser, once again, Faulkner does
something for that loser.

00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:01.067
He's a very sad loser.

00:31:01.067 --> 00:31:06.433
And here we see some of the
reason for that sadness.

00:31:06.433 --> 00:31:09.033
It's that people turn into
monsters when they feel that

00:31:09.033 --> 00:31:10.300
they're completely unloved.

00:31:12.867 --> 00:31:17.533
But still, right now, along with
the self-pity, along with

00:31:17.533 --> 00:31:21.200
the constant complaining,
Jason is getting some

00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:24.500
satisfaction from the fact that
he's complaining against

00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:29.233
his father, once again, a known
quantity to him, known

00:31:29.233 --> 00:31:32.467
all too well in this instance.

00:31:32.467 --> 00:31:39.833
So let's look at the breakdown
of that knowable world,

00:31:39.833 --> 00:31:42.467
because it's satisfying
to Jason.

00:31:42.467 --> 00:31:46.333
That's the thing that's going
to be taken away from him.

00:31:46.333 --> 00:31:50.333
The last thing that gives him
satisfaction is going to be

00:31:50.333 --> 00:31:51.667
taken away from him.

00:31:51.667 --> 00:31:55.667
And the breakdown of the
knowable community comes with

00:31:55.667 --> 00:32:00.600
the automobile, as we have seen,
and all those things

00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:05.300
that are intimated by the
arrival of the automobile--

00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:09.433
the New York Jew, the US
government, Western Union, and

00:32:09.433 --> 00:32:10.733
Wall Street.

00:32:10.733 --> 00:32:15.667
So let's look at one instance
of Jason's sense that he's

00:32:15.667 --> 00:32:19.567
wronged by unknown parties.

00:32:19.567 --> 00:32:22.967
And all of a sudden, we see that
the world has expanded

00:32:22.967 --> 00:32:27.267
tremendously, that even though
Jason is still in Jefferson,

00:32:27.267 --> 00:32:30.367
Mississippi, that all of a
sudden, New York City becomes

00:32:30.367 --> 00:32:33.600
his horizon, becomes his
reference point.

00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:37.933
"I don't see how a city no
bigger than New York can hold

00:32:37.933 --> 00:32:40.167
enough people to take
the money away

00:32:40.167 --> 00:32:42.367
from us country suckers.

00:32:42.367 --> 00:32:44.000
Well, I'm done with them.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.467
They've sucked me in
for the last time.

00:32:46.467 --> 00:32:50.700
Any fool except a fellow that
hasn't got any more sense than

00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:55.033
to take a Jew's word for
anything could tell the market

00:32:55.033 --> 00:32:58.333
was going up all the time,
with the whole damn delta

00:32:58.333 --> 00:33:02.100
about to be flooded again and
the cotton washed right out of

00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:04.833
the ground like it
was last year.

00:33:04.833 --> 00:33:08.600
Let it wash a man's crop out of
the ground year after year,

00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:14.033
and then up there in Washington,
spending $50,000 a

00:33:14.033 --> 00:33:19.067
year keeping an army in
Nicaragua or some place."

00:33:19.067 --> 00:33:23.300
Incredible scale enlargement
in the world of Jason, not

00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:27.067
only New York City, but Central
America as well.

00:33:27.067 --> 00:33:30.033
So we have to figure out why
it is that the world is

00:33:30.033 --> 00:33:33.200
suddenly opening up in
this drastic fashion.

00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:37.767
And it turns out that actually
closer to home, there's

00:33:37.767 --> 00:33:44.367
actually a significant Jewish
population, Jewish community,

00:33:44.367 --> 00:33:46.567
in Clarksdale, Mississippi.

00:33:46.567 --> 00:33:49.100
So Jason could have seen these
people, he could have

00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:52.933
socialized with his Jewish
neighbors, but he's not

00:33:52.933 --> 00:33:54.500
thinking about his
Jewish neighbors.

00:33:57.400 --> 00:34:00.567
Because he's talking about New
York City, he also could have

00:34:00.567 --> 00:34:04.200
been talking about Lower East
Side and Hester Street.

00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:05.967
And this is a picture of Hester

00:34:05.967 --> 00:34:08.500
Street, turn of the century.

00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:11.067
These are not very threatening
people.

00:34:11.067 --> 00:34:14.200
Jason could have been talking
about those Jews,

00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:15.133
those New York Jews.

00:34:15.133 --> 00:34:17.900
He's not thinking about those.

00:34:17.900 --> 00:34:24.233
Instead, the New York Jew that
he has in mind is very

00:34:24.233 --> 00:34:28.200
similar, is a kind of
transnational Jew.

00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:32.000
This is a picture by the
French painter Degas.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:36.467
I think that we know him
probably from all his

00:34:36.467 --> 00:34:39.033
paintings of the
ballet dancers.

00:34:39.033 --> 00:34:43.100
So we think of him as a painter
of very graceful

00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:44.433
bodies in motion.

00:34:44.433 --> 00:34:48.933
But he actually also has a whole
range of paintings about

00:34:48.933 --> 00:34:50.700
social portraits.

00:34:50.700 --> 00:34:56.533
And this is a painting of a
French Jewish banker at the

00:34:56.533 --> 00:34:58.300
French Bourse--

00:34:58.300 --> 00:34:59.167
stock exchange --

00:34:59.167 --> 00:35:09.633
in Paris and the machinations
engaged in by the proverbial,

00:35:09.633 --> 00:35:14.533
I guess, transnational Jew,
always scheming and conspiring

00:35:14.533 --> 00:35:16.233
for no good.

00:35:16.233 --> 00:35:20.267
Jason's image of the New York
Jew has everything in common

00:35:20.267 --> 00:35:24.900
with this anti-Semitic image
in Degas' painting.

00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:31.167
And so we can see that really
the whole financial world is

00:35:31.167 --> 00:35:33.833
really opening up in
the Jason section.

00:35:33.833 --> 00:35:36.233
But there's one other
detail that we get.

00:35:36.233 --> 00:35:40.233
And in this way, Jason's also a
guide for us to the world of

00:35:40.233 --> 00:35:43.033
the 1920s, basically the whole
of the early twentieth

00:35:43.033 --> 00:35:47.067
century, because of his
mention to Nicaragua.

00:35:47.067 --> 00:35:50.700
And it turns out that that's
actually an accurate mention.

00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:57.667
The United States was in
Nicaragua from 1909 to 1933.

00:35:57.667 --> 00:36:02.333
In 1916, getting closer
to the date of The

00:36:02.333 --> 00:36:02.900
Sound and the Fury--

00:36:02.900 --> 00:36:04.500
The Sound and the Fury,
let me just say, was

00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:07.433
published in 1929.

00:36:07.433 --> 00:36:10.367
So keep that date in
your mind, 1929.

00:36:10.367 --> 00:36:14.233
But in any case, in 1916,
there was the

00:36:14.233 --> 00:36:16.200
Chamorro-Bryan Treaty.

00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:21.700
It was ratified by the US Senate
in 1916, and it gave

00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:25.867
the United States exclusive
rights to build an

00:36:25.867 --> 00:36:30.567
inter-oceanic canal
across Nicaragua.

00:36:30.567 --> 00:36:33.900
The Panama Canal was already
in existence, but there was

00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:37.367
some thought that maybe another
canal might be useful.

00:36:37.367 --> 00:36:40.533
And the United States was
claiming exclusive rights to

00:36:40.533 --> 00:36:42.800
build that canal.

00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:49.333
And that treaty also turned
Nicaragua into a near US

00:36:49.333 --> 00:36:52.300
protectorate, so that's Jason's
complaint about the

00:36:52.300 --> 00:36:56.867
$50,000 every day spent to keep
an army in Nicaragua.

00:36:56.867 --> 00:37:00.733
So Jason is someone who reads
the newspapers, clearly.

00:37:00.733 --> 00:37:02.700
He's a good newspaper reader.

00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:04.467
He's up on the news.

00:37:04.467 --> 00:37:09.633
He has almost legitimate
complaints against the US

00:37:09.633 --> 00:37:12.867
government and the foreign
intervention of the US

00:37:12.867 --> 00:37:15.767
government and the drain
on the finances

00:37:15.767 --> 00:37:17.933
of the United States.

00:37:17.933 --> 00:37:22.367
And so all of a sudden, there's
a conflation of the

00:37:22.367 --> 00:37:26.300
New York Jew, the US government,
strangers at a

00:37:26.300 --> 00:37:28.667
distance, up to no good.

00:37:28.667 --> 00:37:33.067
So people who are far away, you
never set sight on them,

00:37:33.067 --> 00:37:36.267
they are harming you
in some fashion.

00:37:36.267 --> 00:37:41.667
Let's look at another
way in which--

00:37:41.667 --> 00:37:44.933
and here, in the earlier
passage, when the US

00:37:44.933 --> 00:37:49.667
government is just spending
$50,000 a day in Nicaragua,

00:37:49.667 --> 00:37:52.100
Jason himself claims to be
completely innocent.

00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:55.833
He's just harmed by the foreign
policy of the United

00:37:55.833 --> 00:37:57.167
States government.

00:37:57.167 --> 00:38:02.967
But in the next passage, we see
that actually Jason is in

00:38:02.967 --> 00:38:08.967
some sense a willing party to
the harm that is coming to him

00:38:08.967 --> 00:38:12.200
in the sense that he is
complicitous in the world that

00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:14.900
he's complaining about.

00:38:14.900 --> 00:38:19.167
And this is also the second
instance of injury from

00:38:19.167 --> 00:38:20.700
unknown parties.

00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:24.267
"Damn if I believe anybody knows
anything about the damn

00:38:24.267 --> 00:38:28.933
thing except the ones that sit
back in those New York offices

00:38:28.933 --> 00:38:33.400
and watch the country suckers
come up and beg them to take

00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:34.500
their money.

00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:38.333
Only be damned if it doesn't
look like a company as big and

00:38:38.333 --> 00:38:43.067
rich as Western Union could
get a market report out on

00:38:43.067 --> 00:38:48.000
time half as quick as they'll
get a wire to you saying your

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:49.533
account closed out.

00:38:49.533 --> 00:38:52.400
But what the hell do care
about the people?

00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:55.133
They're hand in glove with
the New York crowd.

00:38:55.133 --> 00:38:57.800
Anybody could see that."

00:38:57.800 --> 00:39:04.167
Why is Jason so obsessed with
Western Union and with the

00:39:04.167 --> 00:39:08.700
telegraph as a newly developed
instrumentality of

00:39:08.700 --> 00:39:10.400
communication?

00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:15.200
Well, it turns out that he's a
small investor, and he wants

00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:17.733
to find out exactly how
his stocks are doing.

00:39:17.733 --> 00:39:20.967
He wants to be able to invest
or withdraw his money.

00:39:20.967 --> 00:39:23.333
So the Western Union
is crucial.

00:39:23.333 --> 00:39:27.500
His relation to Wall Street is
crucial, but the Western Union

00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:31.667
is crucial in getting those
reports to him on time and

00:39:31.667 --> 00:39:35.633
allowing him to change his
investments on time.

00:39:35.633 --> 00:39:40.133
And it turns out that the
Western Union was in fact a

00:39:40.133 --> 00:39:44.567
very common sight
in the South.

00:39:44.567 --> 00:39:48.800
There were many telegraph
offices in the South.

00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:55.933
And this is the main Western
Union office in New York City.

00:39:55.933 --> 00:39:58.833
So once again, Jason really
knows what he's talking about.

00:39:58.833 --> 00:40:02.733
He's naming entities
that actually were

00:40:02.733 --> 00:40:06.133
real historical entities.

00:40:06.133 --> 00:40:09.133
And here's a bank.

00:40:09.133 --> 00:40:16.133
This is a historic bank on the
historic Oxford Square in

00:40:16.133 --> 00:40:17.367
Oxford, Mississippi--

00:40:17.367 --> 00:40:19.833
that is Jefferson,
Mississippi--

00:40:19.833 --> 00:40:25.000
and this is the main square in
town, so banks were also a

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:28.900
very important presence in
Oxford, Mississippi.

00:40:28.900 --> 00:40:36.967
And it's really Jason's
relationship to the banks,

00:40:36.967 --> 00:40:40.467
both the local banks and also
the national banks on Wall

00:40:40.467 --> 00:40:45.800
Street by way of the mediator,
by the Western Union, that

00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:48.867
really is the main relation
in his life.

00:40:48.867 --> 00:40:51.767
Yes, he has a relation to
his niece, Quentin.

00:40:51.767 --> 00:40:53.700
He has a relation
to his mother.

00:40:53.700 --> 00:40:55.333
He has a relation to
his black servants.

00:40:55.333 --> 00:40:57.400
He hates them all.

00:40:57.400 --> 00:41:02.200
And the most significant
relation that he has is to his

00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:07.767
money, held in jeopardy
now by the national

00:41:07.767 --> 00:41:12.567
banks on Wall Street.

00:41:12.567 --> 00:41:15.967
And it is in that context
that all of a sudden the

00:41:15.967 --> 00:41:23.233
proverb-like phrase reappears,
but in a very sad, almost a

00:41:23.233 --> 00:41:26.467
plea from Jason.

00:41:26.467 --> 00:41:31.033
"Like I say, once a bitch,
always a bitch.

00:41:31.033 --> 00:41:36.067
And just let me have 24 hours
without any damn New York Jew

00:41:36.067 --> 00:41:38.867
to advise me what it's
going to do.

00:41:38.867 --> 00:41:40.767
I don't want to make
a killing.

00:41:40.767 --> 00:41:44.833
Save that to suck in the
smart gamblers with.

00:41:44.833 --> 00:41:50.367
I just want an even chance
to get my money back."

00:41:50.367 --> 00:41:55.400
I think that that is
the very small hope

00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:56.900
on the part of Jason.

00:41:56.900 --> 00:42:00.533
He's not asking to make
a huge sum of money.

00:42:00.533 --> 00:42:05.133
He just doesn't want to
lose all his money.

00:42:05.133 --> 00:42:07.300
And it's such a modest
hope that we know

00:42:07.300 --> 00:42:09.300
it's bound to be defeated.

00:42:09.300 --> 00:42:14.233
Because of course, in such a
world of long-distance action

00:42:14.233 --> 00:42:18.833
and a world operated by total
strangers with huge,

00:42:18.833 --> 00:42:23.067
large-scale, impersonal
institutions, small investors

00:42:23.067 --> 00:42:25.333
are the ones who lose out.

00:42:25.333 --> 00:42:30.267
So it's a phenomenon that
we recognize very well.

00:42:30.267 --> 00:42:34.567
In that way, I think that we
shouldn't forget that just as

00:42:34.567 --> 00:42:40.000
Faulkner has a lot of sympathy
for Benjy, Faulkner also has a

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:42.133
lot of sympathy for Jason.

00:42:42.133 --> 00:42:45.767
It's very hard for us as readers
to have any sympathy

00:42:45.767 --> 00:42:46.633
for Jason at all.

00:42:46.633 --> 00:42:51.700
He's just such an offensive,
off-putting character.

00:42:51.700 --> 00:42:55.800
But I think that that very
resonant, small plea-- "I just

00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:59.500
want an even chance to
get my money back"--

00:42:59.500 --> 00:43:01.667
in that one phrase,
Jason in many ways

00:43:01.667 --> 00:43:04.533
speaks for all of us.

00:43:04.533 --> 00:43:09.333
And Faulkner knows it, that that
is in many ways the most

00:43:09.333 --> 00:43:13.200
important phrase in
the Jason section.

00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:19.300
And as it turns out, the irony
of history is such that the

00:43:19.300 --> 00:43:24.000
history of the United States
turns out to be a corridor to

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:24.900
The Sound and the Fury.

00:43:24.900 --> 00:43:28.900
Because the same year that The
Sound and the Fury came out

00:43:28.900 --> 00:43:30.967
was also the year
of the crash.

00:43:30.967 --> 00:43:34.633
And here is an image of the
trading floor of the New York

00:43:34.633 --> 00:43:40.133
Stock Exchange and two more
images, the crowds outside the

00:43:40.133 --> 00:43:43.367
New York Stock Exchange.

00:43:43.367 --> 00:43:46.000
All those people are probably
much bigger

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:47.967
investors than Jason.

00:43:47.967 --> 00:43:49.467
They're right there
on the spot.

00:43:49.467 --> 00:43:50.700
They're probably
big investors.

00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:54.700
They're the traders, actually.

00:43:54.700 --> 00:43:56.300
A lot of them were traders.

00:43:56.300 --> 00:43:59.667
So they were insiders
on Wall Street.

00:43:59.667 --> 00:44:04.800
But even the insiders had the
illusory sense that if you

00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:08.367
could just be there physically,
that that would

00:44:08.367 --> 00:44:09.867
make a difference.

00:44:09.867 --> 00:44:16.000
So this proves that Raymond
Williams' idea of the knowable

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:19.567
community is actually
a psychological

00:44:19.567 --> 00:44:21.667
demand from all of us.

00:44:21.667 --> 00:44:24.767
All of us want to know the
people we're having

00:44:24.767 --> 00:44:26.000
transactions with.

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:29.933
All of us are creating knowable
communities right

00:44:29.933 --> 00:44:32.800
around us, even though the
actual, historical

00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:37.333
circumstances are making those
knowable communities an

00:44:37.333 --> 00:44:39.900
impossible ideal
in the present.

00:44:39.900 --> 00:44:44.100
So we know that those people are
there on the spot trying

00:44:44.100 --> 00:44:49.267
to recreate in vain a utopian
ideal from the past. And even

00:44:49.267 --> 00:44:53.733
though they're not country
suckers like Jason, in the

00:44:53.733 --> 00:44:57.767
sense that they are not from
Mississippi, they resemble him

00:44:57.767 --> 00:44:59.667
in more ways than one.

00:44:59.667 --> 00:45:05.600
So in that sense, the Jason
section represents the largest

00:45:05.600 --> 00:45:09.533
possible scale for Faulkner.

00:45:09.533 --> 00:45:14.833
It really is about the entire
world captured by Jason's

00:45:14.833 --> 00:45:19.067
dealings and his failed attempt
to come to terms with

00:45:19.067 --> 00:45:20.100
the future.

00:45:20.100 --> 00:45:25.167
The tomorrow that he's guiding
us to is really no place to

00:45:25.167 --> 00:45:28.833
be, but I think that for him and
for lots of other people,

00:45:28.833 --> 00:45:30.500
that is the present.

00:45:30.500 --> 00:45:35.900
But for Jason, it's the problem
of trying to find a

00:45:35.900 --> 00:45:40.233
resting place, a sustainable or
some kind of bearable place

00:45:40.233 --> 00:45:41.200
in that tomorrow.

00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:44.533
That's going to be the challenge
for Faulkner in the

00:45:44.533 --> 00:45:46.467
last section of The Sound
and the Fury.

00:45:46.467 --> 00:45:51.733
So we'll come back to an
alternative to the automobile

00:45:51.733 --> 00:45:56.367
at the very end of The Sound
and the Fury and Jason's

00:45:56.367 --> 00:45:57.600
satisfaction with that.

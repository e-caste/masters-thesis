00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:06.790
PROFESSOR: So today's lecture is
about the claim that we've

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:11.360
been exploring in the context
of Aristotle's ethics, that

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:16.590
the way to cultivate virtue is
by cultivating in ourselves

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.750
certain sorts of habits.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.360
And I want to start by showing
you a picture of a T-shirt

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:29.370
which was popular at MIT in the
mid-'90s when my husband

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:31.140
was a graduate student there.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.790
And what it said on the T-shirt
was, "Gravity: It's

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:45.830
not just a good idea,
it's the law."

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:49.110
Now, if you guys were MIT
students, you would be rolling

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.830
on the floor.

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:52.450
[laughter]

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:56.000
As it is, social beings that you
are, you're rolling on the

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.650
floor at the thought that other
beings are rolling on

00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:59.800
the floor at the thought
of this.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.020
[laughter]

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.640
But what's interesting about
this T-shirt is that it brings

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.180
out a distinction between
two kinds of laws.

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.510
Because gravity isn't a law that
tells you how you ought

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:18.490
to behave. It's a law that
tells you how things do

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:19.660
behave.

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:23.780
And philosophers make a
distinction between

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.410
two kinds of laws.

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:30.880
There are, on the one hand,
normative laws, oughts, things

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.390
that tell you how you how you
should do things, things that

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.580
express, as the name indicates,
norms. Those are

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.730
things like, "look both ways
before crossing the street."

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:45.234
That's something you
ought to do.

00:01:45.234 --> 00:01:48.050
It wouldn't be funny have a
T-shirt that said, "Look both

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.430
ways before crossing the street:
It's not just a good

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.220
idea, it's the law." Right?

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.770
It could be the law, and the
T-shirt, for lots of reasons,

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.500
wouldn't be funny.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.860
It wouldn't be funny to have a
T-shirt that said, "Don't eat

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.340
in the library: It's not just
a good idea, it's the law."

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.840
Because it could be a law in the
library that you not eat.

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.560
And it wouldn't be funny to have
a T-shirt that says, "65

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.380
miles per hour: It's not just
a good idea, it's the law,"

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.980
because in fact, it is
a normative law.

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:21.300
So normative laws express
summative judgments about the

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.620
way things ought to be.

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.640
They are laws in the sense that
you find over at the Yale

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.660
Law School.

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.290
But in addition, there are laws
of a very different kind,

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.580
spread around the
rest of campus.

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.030
Spread around, in fact,
everything that you ever do.

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.100
And those are descriptive
laws.

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.690
They tell you the way
things actually are.

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.320
So it would be sort of funny to
have a T-shirt, "If a car

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:52.750
hits you, you will die.

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.650
It's not just a bad thing, it's
the law." Because "If a

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.430
car hits you, you will die"
is a description of the

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.130
way the world is.

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:07.340
It's a fact about the world
that is a law in the sense

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.990
that it is in a position to
allow you to make predictions

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:14.560
about the future on the basis
of the past. It tells you

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.130
about law-like relations between
things in the past and

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:20.940
things in the future.

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:26.520
Likewise, it's a law of biology
plus chemistry plus

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.960
physics, roughly, that crumbs
cause book decay.

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:36.690
That's a description of a fact
about the world to which the

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.020
normative law, don't eat in the
library, might correspond.

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:43.660
But they are nonetheless
very different claims.

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:49.240
And finally, whereas it's a
speed limit on your car that

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:53.970
you drive 65 miles an hour,
it's a speed limit on

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.660
everything than it not
go faster than

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.900
186,000 miles per second.

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:06.820
The speed of light expresses a
descriptive law about how fast

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:12.250
you can go, whereas the speed
limit "65 miles an hour"

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:18.980
expresses a normative law about
how fast you may go.

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:25.520
Now, why did I start out this
lecture on Aristotle and habit

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.850
with a bunch of remarks about
the difference between

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:33.090
normative and descriptive
laws?

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.752
The reason is this.

00:04:36.752 --> 00:04:44.034
Habits are tools for turning
oughts into ises.

00:04:44.034 --> 00:04:49.940
Habits are ways of taking
normative commitments that we

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:57.560
have about the way we want
things to be, and making use

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:04.040
of the fact that we are
psychological, biological,

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:11.520
chemical, physical beings in
whom patterns of descriptive

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:18.770
law-like relations can be
created by repeating the same

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:22.380
activities over and over.

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:26.330
So when Aristotle says, "We
learn a craft by producing the

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:29.310
same product that we must
produce when we've learned it.

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:32.400
We become builders by building,
harpists by playing

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.350
the harp, in the same way we
become just by doing just

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:38.540
actions, temperate by doing
temperate actions, brave by

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:46.420
doing brave actions," he is
explaining to us the utility

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:52.120
of recognizing the connection
between normative laws on the

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:56.630
one hand--ways we think we want
to be--and descriptive

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:00.160
laws on the other--ways
that we find

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:03.820
ourselves naturally becoming.

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:07.300
Remember, when he describes
for us how it is that we

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:11.910
cultivate virtues, he contrasts
that to two cases

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:14.850
where merely descriptive
laws apply.

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:19.440
He said, it's not like trying to
train a rock to stay in the

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:22.660
air, because that's
a case where a

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:25.870
descriptive law applies.

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:30.090
Nor is it like a case of
watching a plant unfold when

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:34.110
given water and light, because
that, again, is a case where

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:37.270
merely descriptive laws apply.

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:41.620
What's interesting about the
middle realm on which almost

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:45.210
the entirety of the Nicomachean
Ethics focuses is

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:49.470
that it's the domain where the
principle that I've just

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:51.075
articulated holds.

00:06:51.075 --> 00:06:55.330
It's the domain where it's
possible for us to think about

00:06:55.330 --> 00:07:00.420
the ways we want things to be,
to act as if things were

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:05.935
already that way, and in a
self-fulfilling manner, to

00:07:05.935 --> 00:07:10.240
have things become that way.

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:15.990
So Aristotle's basic insight is
that if you want to become

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:24.760
something, act as if that is
what you already were.

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:30.460
If you want to become
instinctively brave, act as

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:33.510
the brave one does.

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:38.220
And then it will become
natural to you.

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:45.317
If you want to become a piano
player, train your fingers to

00:07:45.317 --> 00:07:49.600
act as the piano player's
fingers do.

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:55.410
You learn the craft of piano
playing by producing the

00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:57.480
product that you must produce
when you have

00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:59.100
learned to piano play.

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:02.960
That is, you learn to become
a piano player by

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:07.350
practicing the piano.

00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:11.860
So patterns of behavior that are
initially under conscious

00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:19.299
control can, through a process
of repeated practice, become

00:08:19.299 --> 00:08:20.870
automatized.

00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:24.650
So initially, when you learned
how to drive a car, you had to

00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:27.930
think very carefully about what
to do with each of your

00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:29.760
feet and each of your hands.

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:33.700
Any of you who went to dancing
school in junior high know

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:35.790
that when you learn how to
dance, you start off by

00:08:35.790 --> 00:08:39.190
counting: "One and Two and..."
I won't dance on stage,

00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:41.195
because this is going forever
on the Internet.

00:08:41.195 --> 00:08:42.040
[laughter]

00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:45.100
But those of you who learned how
to dance in middle school

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:48.060
know that behavior that was
initially under conscious

00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:51.430
control became automatized,
such that those of you who

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:54.690
were trained to do waltz and
tango will now, upon hearing

00:08:54.690 --> 00:08:57.880
the music of waltz and tango,
have a kind of motor routine

00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:00.840
activated in your feet.

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:05.670
The fact that this happens
inevitably to biological

00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:10.740
beings like ourselves gives us
a tool for turning normative

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:13.910
commitments into descriptive
laws.

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:18.090
So it has because the case for
me that though it begin as a

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:22.070
norm, "look both ways before
crossing the street," it's now

00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:25.780
a description of me: that I look
both ways before crossing

00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:26.430
the street.

00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:29.630
And any of you who has ever
been to England or

00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:34.330
Australia--countries in which
people drive on the left,

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:38.410
rather than the right--know how
incredibly difficult it is

00:09:38.410 --> 00:09:40.840
to overcome that ingrained
habit.

00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:44.510
In fact, when I'm in England,
I look both directions about

00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:47.990
thirty times, because I'm so
disoriented by the fact that

00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:50.990
my routine doesn't fit
the situation in

00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:52.610
which I find myself.

00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:55.270
If you grew up driving a
standard shift car or an

00:09:55.270 --> 00:09:59.340
automatic car and switch to
the other, it's incredibly

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:02.220
difficult to make the changes.

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:07.100
When we become habituated to a
certain pattern of behavior,

00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:11.190
something that was initially a
normative rule for us becomes

00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:12.830
a descriptive one.

00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:17.530
And in fact, one of the main
goals of parenting is to

00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:22.740
instill in one's children
instinctive responses that

00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:25.690
accord with one's reflective
commitments.

00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:30.980
I want it to be the case that
when handed an item, without

00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:37.990
reflection, automatically, my
children say, "Thank you."

00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:44.570
Now, the same capacity that
allows us to turn normative

00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:48.760
commitments that we reflectively
endorse into

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:54.420
habitual practices can, of
course, be deployed in the

00:10:54.420 --> 00:11:00.350
reinforcement of habits which
we wish to get rid of.

00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:07.270
So for many of us, it is the
case that upon opening one's

00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:13.990
computer, there is an immediate
compulsion to open

00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:19.650
one's Internet browser, and an
immediate compulsion to check

00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:23.040
one's Facebook page.

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:26.800
Now, we talked already in the
very first class about one of

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:30.340
the ways of dealing with this,
which is to eliminate the

00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:34.670
connection that takes you
from the computer to

00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:35.920
the Facebook page.

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:40.810
If you turn off your Internet
browser, then no matter how

00:11:40.810 --> 00:11:46.310
instinctive the reaction is, you
won't be able to respond

00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:48.220
to the compulsion.

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:51.580
If you have an instinctive
tendency to go down to your

00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:56.410
refrigerator at midnight and
drink the full fat chocolate

00:11:56.410 --> 00:11:59.810
milk that's there in the fridge,
if you take the milk

00:11:59.810 --> 00:12:03.740
away, then you don't have
to change the habit.

00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:06.710
So one of the strategies for
self-regulation involves

00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:12.620
limiting access to the
response that you

00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:15.752
wish to get rid of.

00:12:15.752 --> 00:12:20.570
But sometimes either the
response that we want to get

00:12:20.570 --> 00:12:23.110
rid of isn't something that we
want to eliminate entirely.

00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:23.380
Right?

00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:26.610
I don't want to get rid of all
the food in my kitchen.

00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:28.910
Some of you don't want to get
rid of Internet access

00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:31.740
simpliciter on your computer.

00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:35.110
So the question that we're going
to consider in lecture

00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:39.960
today, is what additional
strategies are available for

00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:46.970
breaking the link between
unwanted habits, or the link

00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:51.020
between cues and the
unwanted habits to

00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:52.950
which they give rise.

00:12:52.950 --> 00:12:56.260
So let me ask you to take
out your clickers.

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.220
These are the only times we're
going to use the clickers

00:12:58.220 --> 00:13:01.060
today, but I promise in later
lectures we'll use them in

00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:02.950
less contrived ways.

00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:04.050
So I want to ask you.

00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:05.120
Which is true of you?

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:08.030
That you have no habitual
behaviors that you

00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:09.160
would like to change?

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:11.100
Everything about
you is perfect?

00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:13.955
You're like the figure in Alan
Kazdin's opening chapter who

00:13:13.955 --> 00:13:16.310
wants to change everybody in
the world, but who needs to

00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:18.470
change nothing in
him- or herself?

00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:21.970
Or are you somebody who has at
least one habitual behavior

00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:24.050
that you would like to change?

00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:29.160
And we'll keep polling open for
another six, five, four,

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:33.680
three, two, we've got 110
responses, and let's see how

00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:35.010
it comes out.

00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:36.080
OK.

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:40.070
So 8% of you are perfect.

00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:41.500
I'm thrilled.

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:44.530
I've always wanted to have a
class full of perfect people.

00:13:44.530 --> 00:13:47.370
At least I have, I guess it's
that back left-hand corner.

00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:47.550
[laughter]

00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:51.670
But 92% of you have at least
one habit that you

00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:53.800
would like to change.

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:57.580
For the 92% of you who have that
habit that you'd like to

00:13:57.580 --> 00:13:59.445
change, a second question.

00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:08.430
So for any of you who has ever
gotten rid of a habit and

00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:10.890
thought to do so, which
is true of you?

00:14:10.890 --> 00:14:14.250
Were you able to change that
habitual behavior just by

00:14:14.250 --> 00:14:15.750
saying to yourself,
"You know what?

00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:18.460
I'm not going to check Internet
in class anymore."

00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:19.170
"You know what?

00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:23.580
I'm actually going to practice
my violin every morning at

00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:25.030
ten." "You know what?

00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:29.280
I'm not going to leave my bed
unmade in the morning." So how

00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:31.480
many were able to change your
habitual behavior just by

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:34.330
talking yourself out of it, and
how many of you were not

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:36.610
able to change that habitual
behavior by talking

00:14:36.610 --> 00:14:37.630
yourself out of it?

00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:43.090
And again, we'll cover
this for another ten.

00:14:43.090 --> 00:14:43.355
OK.

00:14:43.355 --> 00:14:46.980
And let's see how the
numbers come out.

00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:50.300
Four, three, two, one.

00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:51.550
OK.

00:14:54.070 --> 00:14:54.840
Oh my goodness!

00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:58.640
35% of you can talk yourself
out of habitual behaviors.

00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:02.590
But the other 65% of you are
embodied human beings of the

00:15:02.590 --> 00:15:05.910
sort whom I took myself to be
lecturing in this class.

00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:07.310
OK.

00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:10.730
It is very often the case,
though obviously not always

00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:15.460
the case, that simply trying
to talk yourself out of an

00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:19.630
unwanted behavior is
extraordinarily difficult.

00:15:19.630 --> 00:15:22.640
And the chapter that we read
from Jonathan Haidt, and in

00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:25.830
fact, the readings that we've
been doing all semester long,

00:15:25.830 --> 00:15:29.602
explain why this is so.

00:15:29.602 --> 00:15:33.910
Part of the reason that at least
65% of you fall into the

00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:38.880
category of people who are
unable to talk yourself out of

00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:42.210
an unwanted behavior
is that we aren't

00:15:42.210 --> 00:15:45.920
just composed of reason.

00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:48.910
Plato gave us the metaphor of
reason, spirit, and appetite.

00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:52.660
Haidt gives us the metaphor of
the rider and the elephant.

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:57.040
Every single one of the authors
that we've read so far

00:15:57.040 --> 00:16:03.340
has talked about the ways in
which we are fundamentally

00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:08.990
processing information at a
rational level that may or may

00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:13.350
not reach down to the other
aspects of what

00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:15.710
Plato calls our soul.

00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:20.410
So Aristotle, in those
incredible closing five pages

00:16:20.410 --> 00:16:23.520
of the Nicomachean Ethics that
I had you read for today, the

00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:27.220
very last bits of the last
book, writes as follows.

00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:30.020
He says, "If arguments were
sufficient in themselves to

00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:33.590
make people decent, the rewards
they would command

00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:37.530
would justifiably have
been many and large.

00:16:37.530 --> 00:16:42.339
But," he points out, "in
a large majority of

00:16:42.339 --> 00:16:45.670
circumstances," simply
saying to people,

00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:46.540
"Hey, you know what?

00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:51.880
You probably ought to pay your
taxes by sometime mid-spring,"

00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:56.790
doesn't cause them to act in
keeping with what it is that

00:16:56.790 --> 00:17:00.490
they want, or you want,
them to do.

00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:06.010
Arguments alone, appeals to
rationality alone, work in

00:17:06.010 --> 00:17:08.420
exceptional cases.

00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:12.770
But they don't work
all the time.

00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:16.640
Now, because I've been glossing
over it in most of

00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:18.730
the material that we've been
reading from the ancient

00:17:18.730 --> 00:17:22.060
authors, I want to point out
that the intervening texts,

00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:25.710
the texts that I'm skipping over
in the rest of 1179, is

00:17:25.710 --> 00:17:30.360
actually an expression of
something that runs through

00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:33.970
every single one of the ancient
Greek texts that we've

00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:37.700
been reading, which is an
expression of a certain kind

00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:43.320
of cultural elitism about the
difference between the

00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:47.190
well-born and the many.

00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:52.460
But I want to, right now, set
aside what is, I think a

00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:55.590
legitimate ground for
challenging some of what

00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:59.730
Aristotle's saying, and focus
instead on what I think is

00:17:59.730 --> 00:18:04.760
true about what he goes on to
remark, which is, that it is

00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:09.340
impossible to alter by argument
what has long been

00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:13.160
absorbed as a result
of one's habits.

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:17.390
And Aristotle goes on then to
discuss something that we'll

00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:20.650
talk about in about
five weeks.

00:18:20.650 --> 00:18:27.300
Namely, given this fact about
human beings, that early

00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:32.270
experience shapes subsequent
behavior, and that pointing

00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:35.890
regulations in place can shape
behavior in ways that is

00:18:35.890 --> 00:18:42.320
pro-social, it appears that
there are implications for how

00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:44.860
societies ought to
be structured.

00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:49.070
And when we got to the unit on
political philosophy, we'll

00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:52.780
look yet again at these
closing pages of the

00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:54.710
Nicomachean Ethics.

00:18:54.710 --> 00:19:00.370
What I want to point out to you
now is that there it is an

00:19:00.370 --> 00:19:06.020
extraordinary connection between
what Aristotle is

00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:09.690
saying in this ancient text--

00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:13.790
here's a beautiful fifteenth
century edition of the Ethics

00:19:13.790 --> 00:19:19.700
in Latin, here's the translation
that we're using--

00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:22.680
and it seems to me, and this
is the point that I want to

00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:26.280
make in the remainder of today's
lecture, that the

00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:31.290
fundamental insight of
Aristotle's ethics is what

00:19:31.290 --> 00:19:35.950
lies behind the literature
in a certain kind

00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:38.020
of therapeutic practice--

00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:41.810
in particular, cognitive
behavioral therapy--

00:19:41.810 --> 00:19:46.600
and I want to show you how this
plays out in a particular

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:49.110
kind of self-help book.

00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:52.050
In particular, a parenting
guide.

00:19:52.050 --> 00:19:54.750
The claim I want to make is
roughly that Aristotle's

00:19:54.750 --> 00:19:57.370
Nicomachean Ethics
is the greatest

00:19:57.370 --> 00:20:01.060
parenting guide ever written.

00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:06.050
So those of you looking for a
baby present for your newborn

00:20:06.050 --> 00:20:08.450
niece or nephew, look
no further!

00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:10.680
[laughter]

00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:15.490
So what I want to do is to
contextualize cognitive

00:20:15.490 --> 00:20:21.230
behavioral therapy by starting
off with a discussion of the

00:20:21.230 --> 00:20:26.290
animal literature of
which it is a part.

00:20:26.290 --> 00:20:31.730
Behavioral therapy exploits the
fact that we are evolved

00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:36.840
beings, continuous with
non-human animals, in the

00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:42.760
kinds of control over behavior
which are available to us.

00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:46.450
So with apologies to those of
you who have taken already

00:20:46.450 --> 00:20:51.210
Psych 110, a brief introduction
to Pavlovian

00:20:51.210 --> 00:20:52.880
conditioning.

00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:53.470
Oh!

00:20:53.470 --> 00:20:54.420
Sorry.

00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:56.520
With no apologies
to anybody, some

00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:59.500
more quotes from Aristotle.

00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:02.370
Just as Aristotle says, "We
learn a craft by producing the

00:21:02.370 --> 00:21:04.790
same product that we must
produce when we've learned it.

00:21:04.790 --> 00:21:08.590
We become builders by building,
harpists by playing

00:21:08.590 --> 00:21:13.320
the harp," when Aristotle says
that, what he is pointing out

00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:18.330
is the importance of structuring
your experience in

00:21:18.330 --> 00:21:23.600
such a way that you have the
opportunity to perform the

00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:27.320
behavior that you wish
to cultivate.

00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:32.090
Give yourself the opportunity to
do the things that you want

00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:35.220
have become habitual, and those

00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:37.840
things will become habitual.

00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:38.680
All right.

00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:41.080
Here's the dog.

00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:45.920
So I assume most of you know,
but it's worth reviewing,

00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:50.640
there is a technique of
regulating animal behavior,

00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:53.600
which has of course been known
for thousands of years.

00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:57.110
You hear report of the training
of domestic animals

00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:59.250
in the ancient Greek tradition,
and in fact,

00:21:59.250 --> 00:22:02.420
Descartes has a long discussion
of how you can

00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:05.300
train dogs.

00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:08.400
(Descartes had idiosyncratic
views about animals.

00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:10.040
He thought that they
were machines.

00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:15.430
But with regard to this
hypothesis, that mistaken

00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:17.510
assumption doesn't make
a difference.)

00:22:17.510 --> 00:22:21.670
So the way classical
conditioning works, is that

00:22:21.670 --> 00:22:27.080
before the conditioning takes
place, you identify an item--

00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:28.940
say, food--

00:22:28.940 --> 00:22:33.310
that produces in the being that
you wish to condition a

00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:38.000
response of salivation, in
this case, or excitement.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:43.440
So the dog sees the food,
and goes, "wow!"

00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:48.070
So the food, in this case, is
what psychologists call an

00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:50.490
unconditioned stimulus.

00:22:50.490 --> 00:22:55.130
It's something that, without
intervention on our part,

00:22:55.130 --> 00:22:58.880
produces is in the being whom
you're trying to condition, an

00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:00.600
unconditioned response.

00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:04.740
You show the food, and without
any intervention on our part,

00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:07.750
the dog salivates.

00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:11.660
By contract, there are lots of
things in the world-- bells,

00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:12.990
for example--

00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:16.030
which produce in the dog
no reaction at all.

00:23:16.030 --> 00:23:17.550
You ring a bell.

00:23:17.550 --> 00:23:20.036
Dog goes, "Big whoop.

00:23:20.036 --> 00:23:21.530
Who cares?

00:23:21.530 --> 00:23:26.980
It's a bell." So in that case,
you present what called a

00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:29.880
neutral stimulus, and what you
get from the dog is what is

00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:33.050
called, no response.

00:23:33.050 --> 00:23:36.720
Now here comes the
conditioning.

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:38.790
You take your dog, and
you present him with,

00:23:38.790 --> 00:23:42.060
simultaneously, the
bell and the food.

00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:46.470
And the presence of the food
is sufficient to produce in

00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:48.970
the dog the Oh, wow.

00:23:48.970 --> 00:23:49.180
Right?

00:23:49.180 --> 00:23:50.730
The dog says, "Food!

00:23:50.730 --> 00:23:51.560
Salivate!

00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:52.090
Excellent!

00:23:52.090 --> 00:23:52.580
Yum!

00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:54.280
Something to eat."

00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:58.580
And so what you've done, is
you've taken paired stimuli,

00:23:58.580 --> 00:24:04.310
the bell and the food, and
produced, as a result of the

00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:08.430
introduction of the paired
stimuli, an unconditioned

00:24:08.430 --> 00:24:11.600
response that is, at
this point still, a

00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:15.310
response to the food.

00:24:15.310 --> 00:24:21.470
But animals are associative
beings.

00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:26.180
And eventually, this
unconditioned response, the

00:24:26.180 --> 00:24:30.780
oh, wow that results as a matter
of hard-wiring from the

00:24:30.780 --> 00:24:37.960
introduction of the food, comes
to be paired with the

00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:39.720
neutral stimulus.

00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:43.720
And when that happens, when the
bell is in a position to

00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:48.720
produce in the dog the response
of salvation, one has

00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:53.220
thereby conditioned the stimulus
to produce in the

00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:56.850
animal a conditioned response.

00:24:56.850 --> 00:25:00.740
Now, it's not just with animals
that this sort of

00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:02.730
thing is possible.

00:25:02.730 --> 00:25:06.970
In the opening pages of the Alan
Kazdin textbook that you

00:25:06.970 --> 00:25:12.380
read, we heard the story of poor
Baby Albert who used to

00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:18.860
think white rabbits were no big
deal, until the neutral

00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:23.950
stimulus of a white rabbit got
paired with the unconditioned

00:25:23.950 --> 00:25:27.850
stimulus of a loud noise that
produced terror in him.

00:25:27.850 --> 00:25:33.170
And when that happened, Albert
came to associate what had

00:25:33.170 --> 00:25:36.420
previously been neutral,
the white rabbit, with

00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:39.870
a feeling of fear.

00:25:39.870 --> 00:25:46.920
Human beings are capable of
coming to have associations

00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:51.700
that have valence, either
positive or negative,

00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:55.260
associations that produce in
them positive or negative

00:25:55.260 --> 00:25:57.260
emotional responses.

00:25:57.260 --> 00:26:00.760
And they are capable of coming
to have those associations

00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:09.130
with entities that previously
had no value to them.

00:26:09.130 --> 00:26:15.860
So with that fact in mind,
psychologists began thinking

00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:23.040
more generally about the
relation between objects and

00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:28.540
behaviors, on the one hand,
and outcomes that those

00:26:28.540 --> 00:26:34.030
objects or behaviors are
associated with, on the other.

00:26:34.030 --> 00:26:37.870
So whereas classical
conditioning is concerned with

00:26:37.870 --> 00:26:42.470
the passive consumption of
some item in the world--

00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:45.350
food is presented to you, a
rabbit is presented to you,

00:26:45.350 --> 00:26:48.240
and a certain association
arises--

00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:53.760
operant conditioning is
concerned with the relation

00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:59.360
between behaviors that you
yourself perform and the

00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:05.900
outcomes to which those
behaviors typically give rise.

00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:10.910
So we have, in our behavioral
repertoire, a bunch of things

00:27:10.910 --> 00:27:13.990
we do that are desired
behaviors.

00:27:13.990 --> 00:27:17.710
It's a desired behavior that you
do your reading, that you

00:27:17.710 --> 00:27:20.790
go to the gym, that you're
polite to your roommates, that

00:27:20.790 --> 00:27:23.710
you call your parents at
least once a week.

00:27:23.710 --> 00:27:27.620
And we also have undesired
behaviors.

00:27:27.620 --> 00:27:31.450
Things that we wish
we didn't do.

00:27:31.450 --> 00:27:38.010
The bad habits that 92% of those
of us in this room have.

00:27:38.010 --> 00:27:44.590
And what psychologists noticed
is that we have resources

00:27:44.590 --> 00:27:49.600
available to us using the
mechanisms that conditioning

00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:56.630
provides for increasing
differentially various types

00:27:56.630 --> 00:27:59.240
of behavior.

00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:04.310
In particular, if we are
attentive to the consequences

00:28:04.310 --> 00:28:09.370
that behaviors typically give
rise to, and if we intervene

00:28:09.370 --> 00:28:13.940
to control those consequences,
we can increase the incidence

00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:18.010
of certain kinds of behavior,
and decrease the incidence of

00:28:18.010 --> 00:28:20.550
other kinds of behavior.

00:28:20.550 --> 00:28:25.210
So if there's a desired behavior
that you wish to have

00:28:25.210 --> 00:28:32.290
more of, you can pair with that
behavior as a consequence

00:28:32.290 --> 00:28:35.560
some sort of reinforcer.

00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:38.870
You can pair with it a
positive reinforcer.

00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:44.650
I can reinforce your efforts
on writing a paper by

00:28:44.650 --> 00:28:48.170
providing you with the positive
reinforcer of a

00:28:48.170 --> 00:28:51.070
letter on your transcript
that has signaling

00:28:51.070 --> 00:28:54.310
value to future employers.

00:28:54.310 --> 00:28:58.200
So I can provide you with
positive reinforcement for

00:28:58.200 --> 00:28:59.825
desired behavior.

00:28:59.825 --> 00:29:04.320
Or one can reinforce a desired
behavior through what is

00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:07.180
technically known as negative
reinforcement.

00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:10.080
The removal of an aversive
stimulus.

00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:15.370
If there's noise in the room,
you are negatively reinforced

00:29:15.370 --> 00:29:19.790
in your tendency to put in
earplugs if the putting-in of

00:29:19.790 --> 00:29:24.990
the earplugs reduces the
aversive consequence of being

00:29:24.990 --> 00:29:27.000
in a noisy room.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:35.550
So we can increase behaviors
that we want to increase bye

00:29:35.550 --> 00:29:41.840
associating with them
consequences that serve to

00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:45.660
increase the value,
subjectively, that that

00:29:45.660 --> 00:29:49.970
behavior has to the individual,
as the result of

00:29:49.970 --> 00:29:54.650
pairing something that the
individual likes already with

00:29:54.650 --> 00:29:57.360
the behavior.

00:29:57.360 --> 00:30:03.970
We can, in addition, decrease
the likelihood of an

00:30:03.970 --> 00:30:07.580
undesired, or in fact of
a desired, behavior by

00:30:07.580 --> 00:30:12.250
associating that behavior with
some consequence that is a

00:30:12.250 --> 00:30:14.270
negative consequence.

00:30:14.270 --> 00:30:20.420
So we can take away something
that you like if you act in a

00:30:20.420 --> 00:30:22.730
way that we don't want.

00:30:22.730 --> 00:30:27.650
And we will, in the final two
lectures before, or just after

00:30:27.650 --> 00:30:32.070
March break, talk about
punishment and how it works.

00:30:32.070 --> 00:30:38.260
So behaviors can be associated
with positive consequences, or

00:30:38.260 --> 00:30:42.250
they can be associated with
negative consequences.

00:30:42.250 --> 00:30:46.080
And sometimes, that
happens naturally.

00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:51.740
So when I eat chocolate cake,
that is associated with the

00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:56.520
positive consequence of the
flavor that it provides me.

00:30:56.520 --> 00:31:02.320
It is positively reinforced,
because the behavior, eating

00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:07.690
the cake, gives rise to a
natural consequence, the taste

00:31:07.690 --> 00:31:10.310
of the cake.

00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:15.840
But it may not be so salient to
me that the behavior also

00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:20.210
gives rise to a consequence
which I don't evaluate so

00:31:20.210 --> 00:31:21.470
positively.

00:31:21.470 --> 00:31:26.530
It increases the amount of
arterial blockage on the way

00:31:26.530 --> 00:31:29.050
to my heart.

00:31:29.050 --> 00:31:34.530
Making salient to people what
the natural negative

00:31:34.530 --> 00:31:40.060
consequences of their behaviors
are is one of the

00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:44.240
ways one can make use
of this paradigm.

00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:48.590
So we can take behaviors that
occur, that we want to have

00:31:48.590 --> 00:31:51.080
more of and associate them with
positive consequences.

00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:53.630
We can take behaviors that occur
that we want to have

00:31:53.630 --> 00:31:56.740
more of, and associate them with
negative consequences.

00:31:56.740 --> 00:32:01.560
We can help make people aware
of the positive or negative

00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:04.930
consequences that these
behaviors already have. And

00:32:04.930 --> 00:32:10.190
finally, we may discover that
unbeknownst to ourselves, a

00:32:10.190 --> 00:32:16.480
certain kind of reinforcer is,
in fact, preserving a behavior

00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:20.100
for us that we wish
to get rid of.

00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:24.320
So a parent may discover that
the reason a child is

00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:29.110
continuing to whine is because
whining, an undesired

00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:33.160
behavior, is in fact associated
with a reinforcer,

00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:35.660
parental attention.

00:32:35.660 --> 00:32:39.140
And one might come to recognize
that the removal of

00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:43.440
that reinforcer will reduce
the behavior.

00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:47.990
So in this regard, operant
conditioning takes our

00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:53.720
capacity for association and
uses it in familiar ways to

00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:59.130
increase desired behaviors and
decrease undesired behaviors.

00:32:59.130 --> 00:33:04.210
But, of course, behaviors don't
arise out of nowhere.

00:33:04.210 --> 00:33:08.360
And the third thing that operant
conditioning attends

00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:15.050
to are the antecedents that
gave rise to behaviors.

00:33:15.050 --> 00:33:21.040
So whether a behavior is likely
to occur depends first

00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:24.330
of all on the setting event.

00:33:24.330 --> 00:33:30.670
On whether the reinforcer is
likely to increase the

00:33:30.670 --> 00:33:33.310
probability of the behavior
occurring.

00:33:33.310 --> 00:33:38.810
You will be more likely to drink
chocolate milk late at

00:33:38.810 --> 00:33:44.390
night from your refrigerator
if you are hungry.

00:33:44.390 --> 00:33:48.400
So if you drink a glass of water
an hour beforehand, then

00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:50.810
that reinforcement that drinking
the chocolate milk

00:33:50.810 --> 00:33:54.080
had won't be so great for you.

00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:58.460
You can set circumstances so
as to make the reinforcers

00:33:58.460 --> 00:34:01.480
more or less effective.

00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:06.929
You can also provide yourself
or others with prompts.

00:34:06.929 --> 00:34:12.330
I want to help you do the
reading, so I provide you with

00:34:12.330 --> 00:34:16.870
reading guides in which I direct
you to the parts of the

00:34:16.870 --> 00:34:21.449
texts which I think are most
important, and I thereby

00:34:21.449 --> 00:34:24.040
reduce the barriers
to entry that the

00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:25.790
readings might provide.

00:34:25.790 --> 00:34:31.440
I help prompt the behavior
by making the task more

00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:33.620
manageable.

00:34:33.620 --> 00:34:39.965
And finally, we can give rise to
behavior differentially by

00:34:39.965 --> 00:34:43.140
the presence or absence of what
are called discriminative

00:34:43.140 --> 00:34:46.780
stimuli, that indicate, in
technical terminology, the

00:34:46.780 --> 00:34:49.310
availability of a reinforcer.

00:34:49.310 --> 00:34:53.260
So in the pages of Kazdin that
we read today, Alan Kazdin

00:34:53.260 --> 00:34:56.690
points out that if the behavior
that we're interested

00:34:56.690 --> 00:35:03.010
in is the answering of one's
telephone, that the ringing of

00:35:03.010 --> 00:35:09.840
the phone is an antecedent that
makes the behavior more

00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:14.030
likely to give rise
to the reinforcer.

00:35:14.030 --> 00:35:16.960
The reinforcer is, being able
to talk to somebody

00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:18.910
at the other end.

00:35:18.910 --> 00:35:22.270
So you're standing in front
of your telephone.

00:35:22.270 --> 00:35:26.550
If the phone rings, there's
reason to pick it up.

00:35:26.550 --> 00:35:30.820
If the phone doesn't,
there isn't..

00:35:30.820 --> 00:35:36.650
So what the framework of operant
conditioning provides

00:35:36.650 --> 00:35:43.200
is a way of cashing out the
Aristotelian suggestion that

00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:47.350
what we want to do is to
structure our lives in such a

00:35:47.350 --> 00:35:51.810
way that the behaviors we want
to have become part of our

00:35:51.810 --> 00:35:55.950
repertoire, become habitual.

00:35:55.950 --> 00:36:00.350
And one of the most effective
ways to do that is to

00:36:00.350 --> 00:36:06.680
structure experience so that the
thing we don't want to do

00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:10.130
is incompatible with an
alternative behavior that we

00:36:10.130 --> 00:36:12.490
put in its place.

00:36:12.490 --> 00:36:19.620
So in the context of, for
example, parenting, Alan

00:36:19.620 --> 00:36:22.530
Kazdin says, "instead of
thinking as your child's

00:36:22.530 --> 00:36:24.980
behavior in terms of what
you don't want"-- right?

00:36:24.980 --> 00:36:28.580
I don't want to have him
whine; I don't want the

00:36:28.580 --> 00:36:31.440
siblings to be fighting; I don't
want my children to be

00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:33.360
staying up past midnight--

00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:38.600
"Start thinking in terms of the
behavior that you do want,

00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:42.040
and reward that opposite."

00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:44.160
So instead of saying to
yourself, "I don't want to

00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:48.050
spend the evening talking to
my roommate and ended up

00:36:48.050 --> 00:36:52.550
having to stay up all night,"
say to yourself, "what is the

00:36:52.550 --> 00:36:56.850
behavior that I wish to
cultivate and reinforce?

00:36:56.850 --> 00:37:01.300
What is the alternative that
will preclude my acting in the

00:37:01.300 --> 00:37:05.040
ways that I don't want, and
encourage me to act in the

00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:07.430
ways that I do?"

00:37:07.430 --> 00:37:17.180
In so doing, you open up for
yourself the most profound and

00:37:17.180 --> 00:37:21.830
lasting form of human
self-control.

00:37:21.830 --> 00:37:26.730
The form of human self-control
that leverages the difference

00:37:26.730 --> 00:37:31.260
between what reason commits
you to and what spirit and

00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:34.850
appetite may be pulling
you towards.

00:37:34.850 --> 00:37:40.250
You come to associate a behavior
that was previously

00:37:40.250 --> 00:37:45.210
unreinforced for you with
positive consequences.

00:37:45.210 --> 00:37:48.070
"When you get rid of a behavior
by rewarding its

00:37:48.070 --> 00:37:51.790
opposite," says Kazdin, the
effects are stronger, "and

00:37:51.790 --> 00:37:56.150
last longer than if you punish
the undesired behavior.

00:37:56.150 --> 00:37:59.740
The best way to build the
behavior you want is through

00:37:59.740 --> 00:38:02.360
reinforced practice."

00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:06.530
Now, "the best way to build
the behavior you want is

00:38:06.530 --> 00:38:11.080
through reinforced practice" is
something that presumably

00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:12.710
you've heard before.

00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:15.480
In fact, you've heard
it before three

00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:18.960
times in today's lecture.

00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:22.460
"We learn a craft by producing
the same product that we must

00:38:22.460 --> 00:38:24.380
produce when we have
learned it.

00:38:24.380 --> 00:38:28.260
We become builders by building,
we become harpists

00:38:28.260 --> 00:38:31.040
by playing the harp."

00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:36.580
So what we try to do in
Aristotle's challenge, and in

00:38:36.580 --> 00:38:40.210
the contemporary analogue of it,
is to structure our lives

00:38:40.210 --> 00:38:44.170
in such a way that we can take
normative commitments--

00:38:44.170 --> 00:38:48.010
things that are good ideas--

00:38:48.010 --> 00:38:53.440
and turn them into descriptions
of behaviors that

00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:55.750
come naturally to us.

00:38:55.750 --> 00:39:00.290
We take them from being good
ideas into being laws.

00:39:00.290 --> 00:39:05.000
And this provides, I think,
new insight on the passage

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:09.410
with which I closed the previous
lecture, as well.

00:39:09.410 --> 00:39:11.650
Aristotle writes that
"Abstaining from pleasure

00:39:11.650 --> 00:39:14.980
makes us become temperate, and
that once we've become

00:39:14.980 --> 00:39:18.580
temperate, we are most capable
of abstaining from pleasures.

00:39:18.580 --> 00:39:20.620
It is similar with bravery.

00:39:20.620 --> 00:39:24.190
Habituation in standing firm
in frightening situations

00:39:24.190 --> 00:39:28.460
makes us become brave, and once
we have become brave, we

00:39:28.460 --> 00:39:32.200
are more capable of
standing firm."

00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:35.770
So this, I think,
is an undeniable

00:39:35.770 --> 00:39:39.860
aspect of human nature.

00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:43.050
But it isn't the full story.

00:39:43.050 --> 00:39:48.000
And the two essays that we're
reading for next class bring

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:54.140
out a complication to the story
that I told today, and

00:39:54.140 --> 00:39:58.890
they ask us stop to think about
whether this entirely

00:39:58.890 --> 00:40:02.590
describes what it is that's
required for bringing about

00:40:02.590 --> 00:40:05.590
the kind of change which
we hope to achieve.

00:40:05.590 --> 00:40:07.530
And I look forward to
talking to you about

00:40:07.530 --> 00:40:08.810
those texts on Thursday.

00:40:16.020 --> 00:40:19.650
We have a couple of minutes for
questions, if somebody--

00:40:19.650 --> 00:40:22.220
by my watch, we have
three more minutes.

00:40:28.290 --> 00:40:30.680
I'll give you positive
reinforcement if you raise

00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:34.565
your hand, then a query that
you have will be answered!

00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:41.700
All right.

00:00:02.033 --> 00:00:09.567
PAUL FREEDMAN: OK, in 743,
civil war started within the

00:00:09.567 --> 00:00:15.833
Umayyad my family over
the caliphal succession.

00:00:15.833 --> 00:00:19.867
This war broke out in Persia,
which is a little unusual

00:00:19.867 --> 00:00:24.033
because until this point the
subversive, discontented,

00:00:24.033 --> 00:00:30.833
proto-Shiite region had been
what is called Kufa, basically

00:00:30.833 --> 00:00:34.567
southern Iraq as it now is.

00:00:34.567 --> 00:00:38.833
It's thought that this revolt
against the Umayyads had the

00:00:38.833 --> 00:00:41.233
support of the mawali.

00:00:41.233 --> 00:00:44.567
And it makes sense that if it
was in Persia, the largest

00:00:44.567 --> 00:00:49.500
non-Arab Muslim country, it
makes sense that you would

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.167
have the most concentration of
non-Arab Muslims, that is to

00:00:55.167 --> 00:00:58.267
say converts or the descendants
of converts, who

00:00:58.267 --> 00:01:01.833
might feel that the egalitarian
promises of Islam

00:01:01.833 --> 00:01:07.767
had been betrayed and that in
fact the religion was an Arab

00:01:07.767 --> 00:01:15.867
one in which non-Arabs were
in a subordinate position.

00:01:15.867 --> 00:01:21.700
The non-Arab Muslims of Persia
had converted, some from

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.633
Christianity, most from
Zoroastrianism, a religion of

00:01:26.633 --> 00:01:29.967
central Asia.

00:01:29.967 --> 00:01:32.167
Wickham takes issue with this.

00:01:32.167 --> 00:01:35.933
If you go back to your reading,
pages 292-294, he

00:01:35.933 --> 00:01:42.867
says that he doesn't think
that the discontent was

00:01:42.867 --> 00:01:46.033
related to somehow the Umayyads,
being an excessively

00:01:46.033 --> 00:01:51.333
Arab, rather than Muslim,
dynasty or that they provoked

00:01:51.333 --> 00:01:54.433
discontent among recent
converts.

00:01:54.433 --> 00:01:56.667
So this is an open question.

00:01:56.667 --> 00:02:01.567
I think there's got to be some
Mawali discontent, but as

00:02:01.567 --> 00:02:03.600
we've seen already there's
plenty of discontent;

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.300
Shiite-Sunni being the most
obvious, inter-tribal,

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.767
regional, problems of holding
this empire together.

00:02:10.767 --> 00:02:25.800
At any rate, in 749-750, the
Umayyad caliph was deposed by

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.833
a member of another family
known as the Abbasids.

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:52.267
This new caliph, Abu'l Abbas,
Abbas- the Abbasids.

00:02:52.267 --> 00:02:55.267
The Abbasids were early
followers of Muhammad,

00:02:55.267 --> 00:02:57.300
although not particularly
heroic ones.

00:03:00.633 --> 00:03:03.833
The family had been supporters,
but hadn't taken

00:03:03.833 --> 00:03:04.633
very many risks.

00:03:04.633 --> 00:03:06.933
So the Abbasids are
not heroes, though

00:03:06.933 --> 00:03:08.167
they are an old family.

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.800
The Abbasids came to power with
support from the Shiites.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.933
This is what Wickham means
by what he calls their

00:03:17.933 --> 00:03:22.667
"salvationist theology";
salvationist meaning that they

00:03:22.667 --> 00:03:28.567
were going to restore the
religious fervor that the

00:03:28.567 --> 00:03:31.100
Umayyads had dissipated.

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.867
So that they were originally
supposed to represent a

00:03:35.867 --> 00:03:41.867
return, a reformation, of Islam
to its austere roots in

00:03:41.867 --> 00:03:51.567
which the caliph was a modest,
clean-living, austere figure.

00:03:51.567 --> 00:03:54.067
They very quickly, if that was
the hope of the Shiites, the

00:03:54.067 --> 00:03:56.333
Abbasids very, very quickly
betrayed this.

00:04:01.033 --> 00:04:05.533
They moved their capital from
Damascus, the Umayyad capital,

00:04:05.533 --> 00:04:11.067
to a new city that
they constructed

00:04:11.067 --> 00:04:14.000
in the desert, Baghdad.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.733
A city built in concentric
circles as a planned round

00:04:18.733 --> 00:04:23.133
fortress city, but also a
commercial city and, of

00:04:23.133 --> 00:04:26.633
course, predominately city
of administration.

00:04:26.633 --> 00:04:32.033
It was located thirty miles from
the old Persian capital.

00:04:32.033 --> 00:04:41.233
The Persian Empire was
ruled from Ctesiphon.

00:04:44.667 --> 00:04:49.100
Relocating the capital of the
caliphate to Baghdad has a

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:52.233
number of obvious
implications.

00:04:52.233 --> 00:04:56.233
While most historians would not
be quite as confident as

00:04:56.233 --> 00:04:59.233
Peter Brown, whom you're reading
for Wednesday is, that

00:04:59.233 --> 00:05:01.333
this represents the
Persianization of the

00:05:01.333 --> 00:05:06.967
caliphate, it is certainly true
that moving the capital

00:05:06.967 --> 00:05:13.067
to modern Iraq, to the
Mesopotamian part of the

00:05:13.067 --> 00:05:17.333
former Persian Empire, orients
the caliphate further to the

00:05:17.333 --> 00:05:22.400
East. It changes the center of
gravity of the caliphate from

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:30.633
the Mediterranean, as in
Damascus, basically to Persia,

00:05:30.633 --> 00:05:37.433
India, the lands between them,
modern Afghanistan, Pakistan.

00:05:37.433 --> 00:05:40.900
At least those are as important,
if not more so now,

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:43.367
than the Mediterranean.

00:05:43.367 --> 00:05:47.300
Even though the empire stretches
from the Indus River

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:58.267
to the Atlantic, its center of
gravity has clearly shifted

00:05:58.267 --> 00:06:02.400
This has implications also for
culture, as we'll talk about

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:03.800
in a moment.

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.933
The accomplishment of the
Abbasid caliphate in terms of

00:06:07.933 --> 00:06:15.100
culture is to bring together
realms that had not been in

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:17.833
very much contact with each
other, certainly not in terms

00:06:17.833 --> 00:06:23.233
of ideas, namely India, Persia,
and the Roman Empire,

00:06:23.233 --> 00:06:29.300
the former empire of the
Mediterranean East. Persia

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:32.333
stands in the middle between
India and the West. To the

00:06:32.333 --> 00:06:37.433
extent that Persia is not an
isolated empire of its own but

00:06:37.433 --> 00:06:41.900
a crossroads, this means that
there's all this exchange of

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:47.800
information, techniques,
science, art, and culture.

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:49.567
But most of all, the
establishment of Baghdad

00:06:49.567 --> 00:06:52.000
clearly means a different
kind of rulership.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.167
One that it does not break with
the Umayyads, but rather,

00:06:55.167 --> 00:06:59.700
to some extent, elaborates
on it.

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:01.933
This is an empire.

00:07:01.933 --> 00:07:04.933
It is not a kind of
sacred kingdom of

00:07:04.933 --> 00:07:07.000
people living in tents.

00:07:10.567 --> 00:07:14.767
This is an empire more open
to Eastern influences.

00:07:14.767 --> 00:07:18.833
That is to say somewhat more
Persian in its style.

00:07:18.833 --> 00:07:23.967
Less Mediterranean and
originally more Shi'ite.

00:07:29.667 --> 00:07:32.700
So the significance of the
Abbasid takeover is really

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:33.733
basically twofold.

00:07:33.733 --> 00:07:36.733
One is this move east to Baghdad
with all that it

00:07:36.733 --> 00:07:40.267
symbolizes that I just got
through saying, the influence

00:07:40.267 --> 00:07:44.767
of non-Arab Muslims, and the
creation of a complex

00:07:44.767 --> 00:07:47.000
administration, an even more
complex administration than

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.233
that of the Umayyads.

00:07:48.233 --> 00:07:51.633
And then, two, it shows the
influence of the Shi'ites.

00:07:51.633 --> 00:07:55.033
This begins as a Shi'ite
victory, but very quickly the

00:07:55.033 --> 00:07:58.433
Shiites, as I said, are
disillusioned, and so it also

00:07:58.433 --> 00:08:00.400
shows the limitations
of the Shi'ites.

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:04.533
The Shi'ites don't just want a
non-Arab dominated Islamic

00:08:04.533 --> 00:08:08.667
world, they want what we called
last week a "republican

00:08:08.667 --> 00:08:13.000
administration", a
non-monarchical polity.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.067
And the Abbasids are

00:08:15.067 --> 00:08:17.900
monarchical if they're anything.

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:23.900
Until the early tenth century,
when the Abbasid caliphate

00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:31.333
starts to break up, the world
of Islam was splendid, rich,

00:08:31.333 --> 00:08:35.900
cultivated, and scientifically
progressive.

00:08:38.733 --> 00:08:42.700
There would be no more great
conquests, particularly in the

00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:46.933
West. Already, before the
Abbasids took power, we've

00:08:46.933 --> 00:08:51.967
pointed to two moments in which
the Arab expansion, or

00:08:51.967 --> 00:08:54.033
the Islamic expansion,
was stopped.

00:08:54.033 --> 00:08:59.767
One in 717 before the walls of
Constantinople, in the failed

00:08:59.767 --> 00:09:01.833
Siege of Constantinople.

00:09:01.833 --> 00:09:06.567
Two, the battle of Poitiers,
not that far from Paris in

00:09:06.567 --> 00:09:09.233
northern France, in 733.

00:09:09.233 --> 00:09:13.333
A battle at which the
Merovingians, or really their

00:09:13.333 --> 00:09:18.167
high servants, the so-called
Mayors of the Palace, defeated

00:09:18.167 --> 00:09:22.600
Arab raiders who then retreated

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:23.933
basically back to Spain.

00:09:26.567 --> 00:09:30.900
To some extent these defeats in
the West were not so much

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:34.800
defeats from the caliph's
point of view as a

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:36.500
reorientation.

00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:42.467
In 750 moving the capital to
Baghdad from Damascus also

00:09:42.467 --> 00:09:45.667
means less interest in the West;
less interest in trying

00:09:45.667 --> 00:09:48.933
to take over France, if that was
ever a serious goal; less

00:09:48.933 --> 00:09:50.367
interest in the besieging
Constantinople.

00:09:54.667 --> 00:10:01.133
The Abbasids begin by inviting
all of the Umayyad survivors

00:10:01.133 --> 00:10:05.433
to a banquet supposed to be a
banquet of reconciliation.

00:10:05.433 --> 00:10:09.433
And instead they had their
servitors kill all of the

00:10:09.433 --> 00:10:14.567
Umayyads at the dinner table,
spread a leather cloth over

00:10:14.567 --> 00:10:16.767
them-- some of them were already
dead, some of them

00:10:16.767 --> 00:10:18.833
merely wounded--

00:10:18.833 --> 00:10:22.233
and with the leather cloth over
them set the table again

00:10:22.233 --> 00:10:28.533
and banqueted on their dead
and dying enemies.

00:10:28.533 --> 00:10:31.333
Satisfying, definitely.

00:10:31.333 --> 00:10:33.133
One Umayyad escaped.

00:10:33.133 --> 00:10:36.333
Not from the banquet, but
he had the foresight

00:10:36.333 --> 00:10:38.633
to say he was busy.

00:10:38.633 --> 00:10:41.867
And he escaped as far as he
could go in the Muslim world,

00:10:41.867 --> 00:10:43.600
namely Spain.

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:51.733
The last Umayyad, then, Abd
al-Rahman, came to Spain and

00:10:51.733 --> 00:10:54.733
was acclaimed by the population,
or got himself to

00:10:54.733 --> 00:10:58.133
be acclaimed by the population,
and ruled in Spain

00:10:58.133 --> 00:11:04.367
as the first Islamic ruler
to defy the caliphate.

00:11:04.367 --> 00:11:09.733
Thus the first independent
Islamic kingdom, we can call

00:11:09.733 --> 00:11:11.567
it-- although they don't
use that term--

00:11:11.567 --> 00:11:14.967
the first independent Islamic
kingdom, independent of the

00:11:14.967 --> 00:11:16.233
caliphate, would be Spain.

00:11:18.767 --> 00:11:22.333
The Umayyad ruler actually
recognized Baghdad.

00:11:22.333 --> 00:11:25.500
He did not proclaim himself
a rival caliph.

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:29.167
It was easy for him to recognize
Baghdad 3,000 miles

00:11:29.167 --> 00:11:31.633
away, or whatever it is,
they weren't going to

00:11:31.633 --> 00:11:33.367
come and get him.

00:11:33.367 --> 00:11:42.733
He took the title of emir, a
ruler who is more like a title

00:11:42.733 --> 00:11:45.233
of a governor than
that of a king.

00:11:45.233 --> 00:11:48.867
Nevertheless, as I said, Islamic
Spain represents the

00:11:48.867 --> 00:11:53.700
first piece of the caliphal
empire to break off.

00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:02.300
When the Abbasid caliphate ran
into trouble in the early 10th

00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:06.800
century, then the Umayyad ruler
of Spain proclaimed

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:09.500
himself caliph.

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:14.533
In 929 he proclaimed himself
caliph of Cordoba.

00:12:14.533 --> 00:12:20.933
Cordoba was the capital
of Umayyad Spain.

00:12:20.933 --> 00:12:25.800
So at this point Spain becomes
the most splendid, most

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:28.733
cultivated part of the
Islamic world.

00:12:28.733 --> 00:12:33.433
So if the period of the maximum
power and splendor of

00:12:33.433 --> 00:12:39.400
the Abbasid caliphate was
roughly 750-910, the period of

00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:43.100
maximum splendor of the
caliphate of Cordoba in

00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:48.600
Al-Andalus, or Spain, was
about 850 to its sudden

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:56.667
collapse in 1009.

00:12:56.667 --> 00:12:57.400
Questions?

00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:59.667
Problems?

00:12:59.667 --> 00:13:01.133
Lot of names here.

00:13:01.133 --> 00:13:03.867
We don't have a final exam,
so what do you care?

00:13:03.867 --> 00:13:09.833
But I realize it is a dramatic
story, but one with a large

00:13:09.833 --> 00:13:11.000
cast of characters.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.033
By now you're used to
this in history.

00:13:14.033 --> 00:13:17.633
Whether these are good cat names
or not, I'm not as sure

00:13:17.633 --> 00:13:23.067
as I am with the barbarians,
but worth experiments.

00:13:23.067 --> 00:13:26.167
As Wickham has described, the
Abbasid caliphate was based on

00:13:26.167 --> 00:13:27.900
tax collection and
administration.

00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:33.933
And your response to that may
be, "Yeah, well so what?" But

00:13:33.933 --> 00:13:35.700
that's not true of
all the states

00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:36.933
that we've been studying.

00:13:36.933 --> 00:13:40.167
If you take something like
Merovingian Gaul, even though

00:13:40.167 --> 00:13:42.600
in the early period they're
still collecting taxes--

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:45.367
remember Fredegund tells
Chilperic, "Let's burn these

00:13:45.367 --> 00:13:50.067
tax records and maybe our
sons will be cured of

00:13:50.067 --> 00:13:52.433
their disease by God."--

00:13:52.433 --> 00:13:54.767
but you'll have scene in
Gregory of Tours, that

00:13:54.767 --> 00:13:59.100
basically the Merovingians are
rich because of plunder,

00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:02.867
military expeditions,
and land.

00:14:02.867 --> 00:14:08.333
Land, above all, is the source
of wealth in the kingdoms of

00:14:08.333 --> 00:14:10.467
Western Europe.

00:14:10.467 --> 00:14:12.733
Land, and the peasants
to till it.

00:14:12.733 --> 00:14:16.133
Obviously it's no good if
it's just empty land.

00:14:16.133 --> 00:14:20.100
Usually not, at least. It's
productive land, and this is

00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:20.967
the source of wealth.

00:14:20.967 --> 00:14:23.467
Therefore the state gains its
wealth on the basis of things

00:14:23.467 --> 00:14:30.467
like land, military power, and
not on the basis of taxing an

00:14:30.467 --> 00:14:36.633
economy that is more sluggish,
has less trade, less income

00:14:36.633 --> 00:14:43.200
than in the cities of
the Muslim world.

00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:52.200
The caliphate was a tax-paying
state with a central army.

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:58.500
Therefore the nobility, as
such as it was, was not a

00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:01.867
group of local potentates, as
they had been under the late

00:15:01.867 --> 00:15:05.600
Roman Empire, great landowners
for example.

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:10.667
Nor was it a military elite
quasi-independent, whose

00:15:10.667 --> 00:15:14.367
loyalty to the ruler was
conditional on their own

00:15:14.367 --> 00:15:21.300
interests, as we've seen with
the Merovingian knights.

00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:27.633
Rather, it was a complicated
administration, served as a

00:15:27.633 --> 00:15:33.433
structure of a vast empire, and
the tax revenue came into

00:15:33.433 --> 00:15:36.467
the caliph, whose
administration, whose civilian

00:15:36.467 --> 00:15:44.200
administration, was supreme over
army, over local elites,

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:46.533
over great landowners,
at least for a time.

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:53.300
The Abbasid Empire was the
greatest state in the

00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:55.267
world at that time.

00:15:55.267 --> 00:15:59.333
Its only rival might have been
T'ang, China, but this is the

00:15:59.333 --> 00:16:02.767
period of the decline
of that empire.

00:16:02.767 --> 00:16:06.167
Baghdad was the wealthiest and
largest city in the world.

00:16:09.033 --> 00:16:13.333
Among the programs of the
Abbasids, in addition to

00:16:13.333 --> 00:16:17.733
building this planned city,
creating a certain kind of

00:16:17.733 --> 00:16:21.133
military structure,
consolidating their conquests,

00:16:21.133 --> 00:16:25.833
among their plans was
a cultural program.

00:16:25.833 --> 00:16:29.667
The cultural flowering of the
Abbasid caliphate is, in part,

00:16:29.667 --> 00:16:32.133
a planned flowering.

00:16:32.133 --> 00:16:35.367
Not just a spontaneous one.

00:16:35.367 --> 00:16:39.933
The caliphs funded translations
into Arabic of

00:16:39.933 --> 00:16:46.033
Greek and Persian texts
dealing with science,

00:16:46.033 --> 00:16:52.667
geography, mathematics,
philosophy, and medicine, in

00:16:52.667 --> 00:16:55.000
particular.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:59.967
In 830, one of the caliphs
established in Baghdad a kind

00:16:59.967 --> 00:17:05.067
of combination of library and
research institute, called the

00:17:05.067 --> 00:17:06.300
House of Wisdom.

00:17:08.667 --> 00:17:12.600
The House of Wisdom, in the
first place, paid for and

00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:18.433
sponsored translations, but
it also conducted research

00:17:18.433 --> 00:17:19.700
activities.

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:24.500
Things like an effort
to measure the

00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:26.100
circumference of the earth.

00:17:28.667 --> 00:17:30.800
The kind of thing that--

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:34.967
you know, how do you actually
do that without modern

00:17:34.967 --> 00:17:36.233
instrumentation?

00:17:39.067 --> 00:17:47.533
A lot of the material that they
translated was from Greek

00:17:47.533 --> 00:17:48.833
scientific works.

00:17:53.967 --> 00:17:56.167
Where did they get these?

00:17:56.167 --> 00:17:58.833
In some cases, they got them
from Byzantium, from

00:17:58.833 --> 00:18:00.167
Constantinople itself.

00:18:00.167 --> 00:18:04.167
It's said that one treaty
between Constantinople and

00:18:04.167 --> 00:18:09.933
Baghdad called for, among other
things, the Byzantine

00:18:09.933 --> 00:18:15.767
emperor to lend to Baghdad a
copy of Ptolemy's geography.

00:18:15.767 --> 00:18:20.633
Ptolemy, one of the great
geographers of the ancient

00:18:20.633 --> 00:18:30.633
world, author of a book called
The Great Geography, known in

00:18:30.633 --> 00:18:34.533
the West later on when it was
translated into Latin from the

00:18:34.533 --> 00:18:41.100
Arabic as the Almagest, which is
a Latin garbling of an Arab

00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:44.033
garbling of the original Greek
title of the work.

00:18:44.033 --> 00:18:46.833
So this was known in the West,
even when it was translated

00:18:46.833 --> 00:18:50.800
into Latin, as the Almagest.
And it was just one of many

00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:54.433
works that, when they finally
reached Western Europe in

00:18:54.433 --> 00:18:57.767
translations from the Arabic,
kept a kind of version of

00:18:57.767 --> 00:18:59.400
their Arabic name.

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:02.933
But the idea that, as part of
a treaty, one of the things

00:19:02.933 --> 00:19:07.167
was you lend us this copy of
Ptolemy so that we can

00:19:07.167 --> 00:19:11.100
translate it into Arabic, shows
the commitment of the

00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:16.500
rulers to the expansion of
practical knowledge.

00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:19.833
What Islamic scholars,
scientists, and policy makers

00:19:19.833 --> 00:19:23.567
were most interested in from the
classical world, that is

00:19:23.567 --> 00:19:26.533
from the world of the
Greek and Roman

00:19:26.533 --> 00:19:29.867
civilization, was science.

00:19:29.867 --> 00:19:31.833
Broadly speaking, science.

00:19:31.833 --> 00:19:35.667
They were less concerned with
Greek plays, Greek poetry,

00:19:35.667 --> 00:19:37.633
Greek literature in general.

00:19:37.633 --> 00:19:39.933
This is partly because they
had their own poetic

00:19:39.933 --> 00:19:42.833
tradition, in Arabic, and partly
because their real

00:19:42.833 --> 00:19:47.767
source of inspiration for
literature would be Persia.

00:19:47.767 --> 00:19:53.067
The stories, as in the Arabian
Nights, and the kind of

00:19:53.067 --> 00:19:59.267
lyrical poetry of the Arabs,
like love poetry, or sensuous

00:19:59.267 --> 00:20:03.000
poetry, is either home-grown
or Persian.

00:20:06.033 --> 00:20:11.667
So they translated things like
Euclid on geometry, or the

00:20:11.667 --> 00:20:20.733
physician Dioscorides, who
wrote, not the only, but the

00:20:20.733 --> 00:20:23.000
leading pharmaceutical manual.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.700
Pharmaceutical manual, a list
of drugs, their properties,

00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:27.400
what they come from,
what they can cure.

00:20:31.733 --> 00:20:35.633
However, although they
concentrated on science, they

00:20:35.633 --> 00:20:38.700
also were interested
in philosophy.

00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:44.033
They were also interested in
propositions, the nature of

00:20:44.033 --> 00:20:51.333
reality, metaphysics, and the
major project in this realm

00:20:51.333 --> 00:20:52.567
was the translation
of Aristotle.

00:20:56.633 --> 00:21:06.233
Aristotle is someone who wrote
on everything: on drama,

00:21:06.233 --> 00:21:15.700
poetry, politics, metaphysics,
ethics, animals, physics.

00:21:18.767 --> 00:21:23.400
And so his influence would be
tremendous in all three

00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:27.767
religions that we are concerned
with: Islam,

00:21:27.767 --> 00:21:31.300
Christianity, and Judaism.

00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:34.667
His influence tends
to be in two

00:21:34.667 --> 00:21:38.433
related realms, or factors.

00:21:38.433 --> 00:21:40.700
One is its comprehensiveness.

00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:44.200
They didn't translate everything
of Aristotle's, but

00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:47.200
all three civilizations were
aware of Aristotle as a

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:48.967
universal thinker.

00:21:48.967 --> 00:21:51.300
That somewhere, in the work of
Aristotle, there's something

00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:53.767
about everything that's
worth studying.

00:21:53.767 --> 00:21:56.800
He is then, an encyclopedic
thinker in a way

00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:58.800
that Plato is not.

00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:01.400
Plato is not interested
in the natural world.

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:04.033
If you go to Plato for
information about animals, or

00:22:04.033 --> 00:22:07.633
plants, you're going to be out
of luck because Plato despises

00:22:07.633 --> 00:22:08.900
things like that.

00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:13.200
Plato is very interested in
ethics, in how to live life,

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:17.233
in reality, in the relationship
between matter

00:22:17.233 --> 00:22:23.500
and spirit, but he's not
a scientist. He--

00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:24.633
to put it mildly--

00:22:24.633 --> 00:22:27.100
he's not interested in the
material world, whereas

00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:30.600
Aristotle believes that the
material world, although not

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:33.100
necessarily the be-all
and end-all of

00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:34.833
everything, is reliable.

00:22:34.833 --> 00:22:37.867
That our senses can give us
decent information, that

00:22:37.867 --> 00:22:41.267
observation of the natural
world leads to more than

00:22:41.267 --> 00:22:45.267
merely practical knowledge of,
say, how to plow, or how to

00:22:45.267 --> 00:22:49.967
plan things, but leads to
knowledge of what creation,

00:22:49.967 --> 00:22:53.933
what nature, is.

00:22:53.933 --> 00:22:58.267
So Aristotle is encyclopedic
and he's also rational.

00:22:58.267 --> 00:22:59.900
This is the second contribution

00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:02.000
that Aristotle makes.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:07.567
Rationality, that anything from
plays to rocks can be

00:23:07.567 --> 00:23:11.767
understood in terms of
logical analysis.

00:23:15.167 --> 00:23:18.000
This is fine when it comes to
plays and rocks, but what

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:19.267
about metaphysics?

00:23:19.267 --> 00:23:22.833
What about the world
of religion?

00:23:22.833 --> 00:23:27.233
Aristotle has a profound
influence here, again not only

00:23:27.233 --> 00:23:31.633
on Islam, but on Judaism and
Christianity, because he

00:23:31.633 --> 00:23:37.033
essentially encourages a
rational view of God.

00:23:37.033 --> 00:23:41.400
Now Aristotle is himself not
much of a theist, that is to

00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:46.133
say, Aristotle doesn't go on
about God very much, and

00:23:46.133 --> 00:23:50.067
whatever God there is in
Aristotle is not a personal

00:23:50.067 --> 00:23:54.067
god to whom you would pray on
the assumption, or in the

00:23:54.067 --> 00:23:58.400
belief, that he was interested
in your well-being.

00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:04.133
The closest Aristotle gets to
God is the notion of a kind of

00:24:04.133 --> 00:24:06.333
Great Mechanic.

00:24:06.333 --> 00:24:10.033
The Prime Mover, as he would
be called in Western

00:24:10.033 --> 00:24:11.100
philosophy.

00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:16.633
The guy who makes the mechanism,
sets it going, and

00:24:16.633 --> 00:24:20.700
maybe, every so often
maintains it.

00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:21.967
Maybe.

00:24:21.967 --> 00:24:26.467
A little oil here, a little bit
of timing there, but he's

00:24:26.467 --> 00:24:30.800
not the God of Gregory
of Tours.

00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:33.633
He's not the God who is
inspiring saints to get

00:24:33.633 --> 00:24:37.133
revenge when their powers are
questioned, or when somebody

00:24:37.133 --> 00:24:39.100
steals hay from them.

00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:41.733
This is not Aristotle's god.

00:24:41.733 --> 00:24:48.867
Aristotle's god is not concerned
with our little

00:24:48.867 --> 00:24:51.033
petty squabbles.

00:24:51.033 --> 00:24:53.500
It's not Muhammad's God
exactly, either.

00:24:56.033 --> 00:24:59.867
It's not a god who brings a
victory in battle, who's

00:24:59.867 --> 00:25:04.000
interested in a new prophecy
that will seal all the

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:09.833
previous prophets, it's a
somewhat mechanistic god.

00:25:09.833 --> 00:25:14.933
It's an eighteenth-century god,
even a sort of deist god,

00:25:14.933 --> 00:25:17.733
for those of you who
have studied that.

00:25:17.733 --> 00:25:24.333
The notion that the world must
have been created by God,

00:25:24.333 --> 00:25:25.933
because it has a lot
of design in it.

00:25:25.933 --> 00:25:28.133
It works.

00:25:28.133 --> 00:25:31.567
One animal gives birth to
another animal just like it,

00:25:31.567 --> 00:25:36.033
the tides go in and out, the
weather is usually rational:

00:25:36.033 --> 00:25:39.167
winter is usually cold,
Halloween is usually crisp.

00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:45.633
That's imposed by some kind
of original order.

00:25:45.633 --> 00:25:49.667
Just like if you went and found
a watch on a deserted

00:25:49.667 --> 00:25:52.867
pathway, you wouldn't assume
that nature had constructed

00:25:52.867 --> 00:25:54.967
the watch, that it just was
growing there the way the

00:25:54.967 --> 00:25:56.467
ferns were growing
by the path.

00:25:56.467 --> 00:26:00.300
You would assume some artificer
had made it.

00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:03.300
But that doesn't mean that the
artificer is still alive,

00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:10.567
still interested in the watch,
inclined to take care of you.

00:26:10.567 --> 00:26:13.967
I go on this detour, or
seeming detour about

00:26:13.967 --> 00:26:17.933
Aristotle, because he's
important to everything in the

00:26:17.933 --> 00:26:22.267
period that we're discussing,
and also in the period that is

00:26:22.267 --> 00:26:26.500
concerned for the West in the
continuation of this course in

00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:28.933
History 211.

00:26:28.933 --> 00:26:33.233
There are three thinkers, just
to take examples, the most

00:26:33.233 --> 00:26:37.833
famous thinkers in each of the
Jewish, Christian, and Islamic

00:26:37.833 --> 00:26:41.567
traditions, who embrace
Aristotle and in doing so

00:26:41.567 --> 00:26:48.667
embrace the idea of god as a
rational companion to man.

00:26:48.667 --> 00:26:53.367
These are the Arab philosopher,
known in the West

00:26:53.367 --> 00:26:55.867
as Averroes.

00:26:55.867 --> 00:26:59.100
Here again, as with Almagest,
we're using his sort of

00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:01.400
Latin-garbled name.

00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:08.767
Averroes, active in
Spain, 1126-1198.

00:27:08.767 --> 00:27:16.533
Maimonides, perhaps the greatest
Jewish philosopher.

00:27:16.533 --> 00:27:22.100
A rabbi, a physician, a
courtier, and a philosopher,

00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:31.833
also active in Spain, but
also in Egypt 1135-1204.

00:27:31.833 --> 00:27:38.833
And Thomas Aquinas, who spent
most of his career teaching at

00:27:38.833 --> 00:27:45.033
the University of Paris,
1225-1274.

00:27:45.033 --> 00:27:47.933
All of these thinkers
embraced Aristotle.

00:27:47.933 --> 00:27:53.333
The Latin ones, like
Aquinas, via

00:27:53.333 --> 00:27:56.033
translations from the Arabic.

00:27:56.033 --> 00:27:58.833
Aristotle was known in the
medieval West, not from the

00:27:58.833 --> 00:28:02.400
Greek originals, but from
translations made from Arabic

00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:04.500
into Latin.

00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:07.600
All believe that reason and
faith are compatible.

00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:16.300
All based their outlook, not
only on nature, but on God, on

00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:21.233
an Aristotelian form
of knowledge.

00:28:21.233 --> 00:28:26.233
Interesting, in that Aristotle
knew nothing about Judaism,

00:28:26.233 --> 00:28:28.233
Christianity, or Islam.

00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:41.700
So, what is it about Aristotle,
what is it about

00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:44.967
Diascordes, what is it about
Ptolemy, of all of these

00:28:44.967 --> 00:28:48.367
scientists and philosophers that
is of such fascination to

00:28:48.367 --> 00:28:49.633
the Islamic world?

00:28:52.133 --> 00:28:55.433
All of this emphasis that we've
made on Islamic culture

00:28:55.433 --> 00:28:59.633
and its openness to other
influences may seem strange to

00:28:59.633 --> 00:29:03.567
you in light of the reputation
Islam has in modern America,

00:29:03.567 --> 00:29:07.400
or at least in many circles of
modern America and Europe, as

00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:11.667
being obscurantist, or
anti-modern, or religiously

00:29:11.667 --> 00:29:13.200
inflexible.

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:21.100
I teach a group of retired
people where I live, just

00:29:21.100 --> 00:29:26.933
outside New York, and we're
studying Islamic Spain.

00:29:26.933 --> 00:29:35.367
And they are astounded at what
I've just described, at the

00:29:35.367 --> 00:29:38.433
openness of Islam to other
civilizations, at its

00:29:38.433 --> 00:29:43.633
tolerance, at its
curiosity about

00:29:43.633 --> 00:29:47.333
classical and Persian science.

00:29:47.333 --> 00:29:51.000
And I was surprised because this
is not new information.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.967
This is not something that
historians have just come up

00:29:53.967 --> 00:29:56.000
with and just discovered.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:59.633
If you read medieval history
textbooks of a hundred years

00:29:59.633 --> 00:30:01.767
ago, it's in there.

00:30:01.767 --> 00:30:05.600
Everybody knows that Aristotle
was translated from Arabic

00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:06.900
into Latin.

00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:09.067
"Everybody knows", everybody
who studied

00:30:09.067 --> 00:30:11.233
the Middle Ages knows.

00:30:11.233 --> 00:30:15.667
And I said to them, because you
can't say to older people,

00:30:15.667 --> 00:30:21.400
"Oh, well you know your
education is actually not very

00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:24.233
good," the way we say
to you all the time.

00:30:24.233 --> 00:30:27.700
Or, "Your attention span is
not very good, because all

00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:32.333
you're doing is you're plugged
in to your social world".

00:30:32.333 --> 00:30:35.200
No, these people went to college
in the tough old days,

00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:39.833
allegedly, and they're like,
"God, I thought Islam was just

00:30:39.833 --> 00:30:45.800
this sort of frozen religion
that had never changed." So

00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:47.233
you don't have that
disadvantage.

00:30:47.233 --> 00:30:50.800
You don't have that idea, and
so I'm not going to browbeat

00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:53.333
you with it on the basis of
the experience of teaching

00:30:53.333 --> 00:30:55.433
seventy-year-olds.

00:30:55.433 --> 00:30:58.067
But there it is.

00:30:58.067 --> 00:31:01.533
I do not accept the notion, well
with one exception, with

00:31:01.533 --> 00:31:03.933
of one honorable exception--

00:31:03.933 --> 00:31:05.633
STUDENT: I'm forty-nine.

00:31:05.633 --> 00:31:06.867
PROFESSOR: Right, me too.

00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:15.067
I don't want to go into a long
discussion about, "Islam,

00:31:15.067 --> 00:31:18.433
right or wrong?" Or, "Islam,
progressive or regressive?" I

00:31:18.433 --> 00:31:23.733
will say this: there are those
who believe, wrongly in my

00:31:23.733 --> 00:31:25.533
opinion, that there's always
been this "clash of

00:31:25.533 --> 00:31:27.933
civilization", as it's sometimes
called, between the

00:31:27.933 --> 00:31:33.600
progressive Christian West and
the obscurantist Islamic East.

00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:36.633
I don't accept that, in part for
reasons you've just heard.

00:31:36.633 --> 00:31:45.000
There is no consistent Islamic
tradition of the maintenance

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:49.000
of dogma, or the conversion
of the world by force.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:54.767
Insofar as that exists now, it
is, in my opinion, a modern

00:31:54.767 --> 00:31:55.200
phenomenon.

00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:59.100
It is a phenomenon that results
from an encounter with

00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:02.200
the West beginning around the
time of Napoleon's conquest of

00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:02.967
Egypt, perhaps.

00:32:02.967 --> 00:32:06.200
It's about two centuries old.

00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:10.467
There's another kind of
belief that at some

00:32:10.467 --> 00:32:12.733
point things changed.

00:32:12.733 --> 00:32:15.600
There's a book by Bernard
Lewis, the most eminent

00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:17.767
Western scholar of
Islamic culture,

00:32:17.767 --> 00:32:21.167
called "What Went Wrong".

00:32:21.167 --> 00:32:24.667
And so Lewis' assumption is
that the world that I'm

00:32:24.667 --> 00:32:28.633
describing, the Abbasid
caliphate, is an open society

00:32:28.633 --> 00:32:32.833
and at some point and for some
reasons, the Islamic world

00:32:32.833 --> 00:32:33.633
closed itself.

00:32:33.633 --> 00:32:37.267
It became less susceptible to
outside influence, more

00:32:37.267 --> 00:32:43.567
suspicious of it, more dogmatic,
more anti-modern,

00:32:43.567 --> 00:32:47.133
more fixated on literalism, what
in the Western Christian

00:32:47.133 --> 00:32:47.800
tradition would be called

00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:54.133
fundamentalism, and on
tradition.

00:32:54.133 --> 00:32:57.400
I don't really like this either,
because it sees all

00:32:57.400 --> 00:33:02.000
progress as the property of
Western civilization.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:06.267
And it's not that I am not
interested in Western

00:33:06.267 --> 00:33:06.967
civilization.

00:33:06.967 --> 00:33:08.067
I've taught it.

00:33:08.067 --> 00:33:10.667
I've taught it because
I liked it.

00:33:10.667 --> 00:33:15.533
I'm not somebody who believes
that it's all a tale of

00:33:15.533 --> 00:33:20.400
oppression, but I don't think
that anybody who diverts from

00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:25.767
the path of Western civilization
at some point is

00:33:25.767 --> 00:33:29.400
going off the cliff, or off the
trail, and into the woods.

00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:33.867
There are a lot of different
civilizations out there.

00:33:33.867 --> 00:33:36.767
There's a third related idea
that the Arabs are just

00:33:36.767 --> 00:33:37.600
intermediaries.

00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:40.267
Yeah, it's great, they translate
Aristotle so that

00:33:40.267 --> 00:33:44.033
the real guys who can really use
Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas

00:33:44.033 --> 00:33:46.033
et al, can get started.

00:33:46.033 --> 00:33:49.267
I don't accept that, either,
because they

00:33:49.267 --> 00:33:50.167
do more than that.

00:33:50.167 --> 00:33:53.767
They do an awful lot of original
research in medicine,

00:33:53.767 --> 00:33:56.867
in mathematics, in philosophy.

00:34:00.733 --> 00:34:05.033
But, within all of this, to my
mind, fruitless speculation,

00:34:05.033 --> 00:34:08.100
there is a kernel of what is
an interesting problem.

00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:11.667
And the interesting problem is,
why were the Arabs so much

00:34:11.667 --> 00:34:14.867
more successful in assimilating
conquered

00:34:14.867 --> 00:34:18.033
cultures than other
invaders were?

00:34:18.033 --> 00:34:20.333
Say, for example, the Germans.

00:34:23.100 --> 00:34:28.133
You don't get this kind of
efflorescence of culture under

00:34:28.133 --> 00:34:33.233
the barbarian occupants of
the former Roman Empire.

00:34:33.233 --> 00:34:35.933
We're talking, not just about
cultural survival, keep in

00:34:35.933 --> 00:34:47.533
mind, but about an expansion
of science and allied arts.

00:34:47.533 --> 00:34:52.533
I'd say there are maybe four
factors that encouraged the

00:34:52.533 --> 00:34:56.633
Arab conquest to absorb
these new influences.

00:34:56.633 --> 00:34:58.933
They're not in themselves
explanations, but they are

00:34:58.933 --> 00:35:02.467
certainly background factors.

00:35:02.467 --> 00:35:08.633
The fact that the conquest was
quick and relatively painless,

00:35:08.633 --> 00:35:13.333
and that it was not really
a religious war.

00:35:13.333 --> 00:35:16.167
Two, and I think here
very important, the

00:35:16.167 --> 00:35:18.567
elimination of frontiers.

00:35:18.567 --> 00:35:21.867
I mentioned this
briefly before.

00:35:21.867 --> 00:35:26.700
You get Persian as well
as Greek astronomy.

00:35:26.700 --> 00:35:32.700
From India you get things like
chess, so called Arabic

00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:36.700
numerals, which actually, as we
all know, come from India.

00:35:36.700 --> 00:35:40.400
These things come into the Arab
and Persian worlds from

00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:45.033
India and eventually to Europe
as well, in a world in which

00:35:45.033 --> 00:35:50.600
there are no frontiers between
India and North Africa.

00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:54.700
They could go these thousands
of miles peacefully.

00:36:01.367 --> 00:36:03.933
The elimination of linguistic
boundaries.

00:36:03.933 --> 00:36:07.533
Arabic becomes the language of
learning, as much as Latin

00:36:07.533 --> 00:36:11.467
would be in the European Middle
Ages, much as English

00:36:11.467 --> 00:36:16.733
has tended to become
in our era.

00:36:16.733 --> 00:36:19.800
So Maimonides, the great Jewish
philosopher, wrote

00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:21.033
largely in Arabic.

00:36:24.433 --> 00:36:29.133
The Christians of Spain, so
called Mozarabic Christians,

00:36:29.133 --> 00:36:33.533
studied Arabic, fought in
Arabic, wrote in Arabic.

00:36:36.233 --> 00:36:39.967
And finally, number four, the
attitude of the conquerors and

00:36:39.967 --> 00:36:41.700
the conquered.

00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:48.533
The attitude of the conquerors
was what Peter Brown in the

00:36:48.533 --> 00:36:51.667
reading for Wednesday will call,
"a garden protected by

00:36:51.667 --> 00:36:52.800
our spears".

00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:56.600
This is a quote from one
of the conquerors.

00:36:56.600 --> 00:37:00.667
The Arab conquerors considered
these to be wonderful

00:37:00.667 --> 00:37:04.267
civilizations that they were
not going to pillage or

00:37:04.267 --> 00:37:08.200
destroy, but rather protect.
"A garden protected by our

00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:12.133
spears." But they were planning
on enjoying the

00:37:12.133 --> 00:37:17.200
garden, not merely standing on
the outside defending it for

00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:18.433
other people to enjoy.

00:37:21.267 --> 00:37:24.300
The conquerors were confident
in their religion, so

00:37:24.300 --> 00:37:28.200
confident that they didn't need
for others to recognize

00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:30.667
it or convert.

00:37:30.667 --> 00:37:35.567
It also gave them the confidence
to accept new ideas

00:37:35.567 --> 00:37:38.633
from Greek civilization,
from Persian

00:37:38.633 --> 00:37:41.867
civilization, from India.

00:37:41.867 --> 00:37:46.133
But there's also the attitude
of the conquered.

00:37:46.133 --> 00:37:50.167
Brown says that, "as the storm
of the Arab armies rolled over

00:37:50.167 --> 00:37:54.067
the horizon, the population of
the Near East sat back to

00:37:54.067 --> 00:37:59.567
enjoy the sunshine." The
Islamic conquest was of

00:37:59.567 --> 00:38:05.400
benefit, and perceived as of
benefit, by most of the people

00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:06.633
who were conquered.

00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:14.633
A kind of counter example,
in a way, explains this.

00:38:14.633 --> 00:38:20.167
In Cordoba, the capital of
the Umayyad caliphate, or

00:38:20.167 --> 00:38:26.733
soon-to-be caliphate of Spain,
a group of Christians around

00:38:26.733 --> 00:38:34.700
850, were so upset at the
contented attitude of the

00:38:34.700 --> 00:38:38.200
Christians of Islamic Spain--

00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:41.100
who were, if not a majority,
probably about fifty percent,

00:38:41.100 --> 00:38:44.267
close to fifty percent
at this time--

00:38:44.267 --> 00:38:48.600
these more fanatical, or at
least more serious Christians,

00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:51.967
were so angry that all of their
compatriots seemed to be

00:38:51.967 --> 00:38:55.200
just fine with Islamic rule
that they got up in the

00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:58.033
marketplace of Cordoba and
denounced Muhammad as a

00:38:58.033 --> 00:39:04.067
charlatan, as a false god,
and as not a prophet.

00:39:04.067 --> 00:39:07.700
And while Islam is tolerant,
that is something that you

00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:09.667
couldn't do.

00:39:09.667 --> 00:39:12.833
So they did the thing that was
most defiant of the regime,

00:39:12.833 --> 00:39:16.667
really the moral equivalent
of burning yourself in the

00:39:16.667 --> 00:39:20.333
marketplace, and indeed they
were imprisoned, told to

00:39:20.333 --> 00:39:23.567
recant, and when they didn't
recant, they were executed.

00:39:23.567 --> 00:39:26.667
There are about fifty of these
"Martyrs of Cordoba", as

00:39:26.667 --> 00:39:28.367
they're called.

00:39:28.367 --> 00:39:31.700
But they have to seek martyrdom
because they have to

00:39:31.700 --> 00:39:36.567
look for it, they have to create
it, because almost all

00:39:36.567 --> 00:39:39.367
the rest of their compatriots
are perfectly happy to be

00:39:39.367 --> 00:39:41.833
Mozarabic Christians, practicing
the freedom of

00:39:41.833 --> 00:39:46.367
their religion under a
beneficent regime.

00:39:46.367 --> 00:39:49.500
Beneficent in the eyes of these
Martyr Christians, but

00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:54.667
nevertheless the regime
of the devil.

00:39:54.667 --> 00:39:57.733
This shows you something about
the nature of the Arab

00:39:57.733 --> 00:39:59.167
conquest and occupation.

00:40:01.667 --> 00:40:06.500
Let me just speak briefly about
a couple of aspects of

00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:12.000
what the Islamic world was
interested in studying, and we

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:15.700
may continue over into next time
since the lecture on the

00:40:15.700 --> 00:40:19.067
seventh century is actually
rather short.

00:40:19.067 --> 00:40:22.433
Let's start with mathematics.

00:40:22.433 --> 00:40:27.133
The great accomplishment of this
time is the introduction

00:40:27.133 --> 00:40:30.267
of Arabic numbers, which if
you've ever tried to multiply

00:40:30.267 --> 00:40:33.867
or divide with Roman numerals,
are superior.

00:40:33.867 --> 00:40:38.433
Arabic numbers come from India,
and along with this

00:40:38.433 --> 00:40:41.933
system of numerals, they
imported zero--

00:40:41.933 --> 00:40:46.667
both the number, or the
non-number, and the concept.

00:40:46.667 --> 00:40:50.933
The concept of zero allows for
things like decimal places,

00:40:50.933 --> 00:40:53.267
which are also developed
at this time.

00:40:56.733 --> 00:41:02.700
From India the Arabs get the
kind of very basic ideas of

00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:06.767
trigonometry, the
sine function.

00:41:06.767 --> 00:41:11.133
But it is their own researches,
their own

00:41:11.133 --> 00:41:16.600
progress, that leads to the
discovery, or development, of

00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:18.233
the five other functions.

00:41:18.233 --> 00:41:22.433
And here I'm on kind of tricky
ground, because despite what

00:41:22.433 --> 00:41:25.033
they tell you about math
literacy and how important it

00:41:25.033 --> 00:41:27.800
is, I haven't used this
since tenth grade.

00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:34.067
But I do remember the cosine,
the tangent, the cotangent,

00:41:34.067 --> 00:41:36.433
the secant, and the
cosecant, right?

00:41:36.433 --> 00:41:39.433
All of these are discovered
by the Arabs.

00:41:39.433 --> 00:41:43.533
They built on an edifice who's
foundation is Indian

00:41:43.533 --> 00:41:44.767
mathematics.

00:41:47.133 --> 00:41:53.000
In the early ninth century, a
scholar attached to that House

00:41:53.000 --> 00:42:08.200
of Wisdom in Baghdad, named
Al-Khuarizm, in the early

00:42:08.200 --> 00:42:11.900
ninth century, Al-Khuarizmi
writes a book with the title

00:42:11.900 --> 00:42:14.233
that can be translated as
something like, The Book of

00:42:14.233 --> 00:42:17.400
Addition and Subtraction
According to the Hindu

00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:18.567
Calculation.

00:42:18.567 --> 00:42:22.500
And this is what incorporates
zero and decimal places, and

00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:25.600
interestingly enough this book
is known only from its

00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:28.167
translation into Latin.

00:42:28.167 --> 00:42:30.467
The Latin version survives,
whereas the

00:42:30.467 --> 00:42:32.467
original Arabic does not.

00:42:36.133 --> 00:42:38.800
Within a century of the
publication of this book,

00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:43.567
decimal fractions have been
developed, square roots, the

00:42:43.567 --> 00:42:48.667
value of pi to sixteen decimal
places had been calculated.

00:42:48.667 --> 00:42:54.067
Al-Khuarizm is also the author
of a treatise on algebra.

00:42:54.067 --> 00:43:04.500
The word "algebra" comes from
al-jabr, which is sort of

00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:08.067
restoring, restoring something
that has been imbalanced and

00:43:08.067 --> 00:43:11.000
that you're now going about to
balance, which of course is,

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:15.133
in a way, the visual
nature of algebra.

00:43:15.133 --> 00:43:17.600
Al-Khuarizmi was also
an astronomer.

00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:21.067
He developed star tables that
allowed one to locate the

00:43:21.067 --> 00:43:25.333
planets and stars at different
times of year and

00:43:25.333 --> 00:43:27.333
at different latitudes.

00:43:27.333 --> 00:43:33.867
This is what allows the making
of things like astrolabes or,

00:43:33.867 --> 00:43:34.967
later, sextants.

00:43:34.967 --> 00:43:38.633
These are things that describe
the sky at a particular

00:43:38.633 --> 00:43:39.100
[correction: place]--

00:43:39.100 --> 00:43:46.700
that allow you then to keep
time; and also to navigate; to

00:43:46.700 --> 00:43:51.067
calculate time for things
like prayers, or feasts,

00:43:51.067 --> 00:43:53.333
celebrations; also to
cast horoscopes.

00:43:57.467 --> 00:44:01.367
I'll work a little more with
you on geography, medicine,

00:44:01.367 --> 00:44:05.133
and then summarize the Abbasids
at the beginning of

00:44:05.133 --> 00:44:07.233
our next class.

00:44:07.233 --> 00:44:08.667
So I'll let you go for now.

00:44:08.667 --> 00:44:09.933
Thanks.

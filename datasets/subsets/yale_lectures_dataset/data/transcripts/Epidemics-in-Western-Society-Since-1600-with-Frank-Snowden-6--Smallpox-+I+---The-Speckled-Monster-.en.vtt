00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:06.203
Prof: I want to turn to
the next topic,

00:00:06.203 --> 00:00:10.280
which marks a new unit in our
course.

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.469
That is to say,
until now we've dealt with

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:18.762
bubonic plague,
in a series of talks and in

00:00:18.762 --> 00:00:21.930
your first section meeting.
 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.840
Now I'd like to look,
for comparative purposes,

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.410
at a very different high-impact
disease;

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:34.220
and this time and next we'll be
dealing with smallpox.

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.812
So, I think you deserve an
answer to the obvious questions:

00:00:38.812 --> 00:00:42.059
why smallpox,
and why at this stage in the

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:42.930
course?
 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.598
So, I want to give you a little
bit of explanation,

00:00:46.598 --> 00:00:48.580
to see where we're going.
 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:54.388
The first has to do with I
might call a varied intellectual

00:00:54.388 --> 00:00:57.998
diet,
and I want us to deal with

00:00:57.998 --> 00:01:01.780
diseases of very different
types,

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.147
and so we'll have to examine
the impact of different kinds of

00:01:06.147 --> 00:01:07.750
infectious diseases.
 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.980
Plague was a bacterial disease.
 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:14.230
Smallpox instead is viral.
 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:17.188
Plague was transmitted by
vectors.

00:01:17.188 --> 00:01:21.989
You know the drill now,
the role of rats and fleas.

00:01:21.989 --> 00:01:28.572
Smallpox instead is spread by
contact and airborne inhalation

00:01:28.572 --> 00:01:30.110
of droplets.
 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:36.089
Plague is a classic epidemic
disease, in the sense that it's

00:01:36.089 --> 00:01:42.473
an outside invader that ravages
a locality for a season and then

00:01:42.473 --> 00:01:43.690
departs.
 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:50.006
Smallpox is different in that
it can be both endemic and

00:01:50.006 --> 00:01:51.269
epidemic.
 

00:01:51.269 --> 00:01:55.500
So, we'll see a different
dynamic.

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:01.070
It's also true that the social
responses to smallpox were quite

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:02.150
different.
 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:07.078
Plague was associated with
terror and social disruption,

00:02:07.078 --> 00:02:10.810
and in the New World we'll see
that it had an even more

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.985
dramatic impact on the Native--
smallpox did--on the Native

00:02:14.985 --> 00:02:16.460
American population.
 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:21.805
But in European conditions it
was a familiar endemic disease

00:02:21.805 --> 00:02:27.637
with a less dramatic--
as a cause--was less dramatic

00:02:27.637 --> 00:02:33.440
as a cause of social tensions
and disruption.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:39.818
We'll see too that in terms of
impact, for chronology it makes

00:02:39.818 --> 00:02:45.568
sense to look at smallpox at
this stage in our class.

00:02:45.568 --> 00:02:49.038
It had long been present in
human history,

00:02:49.038 --> 00:02:54.405
but there was an upsurge in
smallpox in the seventeenth and

00:02:54.405 --> 00:02:59.306
eighteenth centuries that
accompanied the surge in the

00:02:59.306 --> 00:03:01.620
demography of Europe.
 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.481
And it also reflected the
transformation of social and

00:03:05.481 --> 00:03:09.781
economic conditions associated
with the commercialization of

00:03:09.781 --> 00:03:12.635
agriculture,
the onset of industrial

00:03:12.635 --> 00:03:15.421
development,
and rapid, unplanned

00:03:15.421 --> 00:03:18.485
urbanization,
with those associated

00:03:18.485 --> 00:03:21.818
pathologies such as
overcrowding,

00:03:21.818 --> 00:03:25.139
both at home and in the
workplace.

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:30.750
In those conditions,
smallpox was a great killer,

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:35.166
and it succeeded plague as the
most dreaded disease of the

00:03:35.166 --> 00:03:38.729
late-seventeenth and the
eighteenth century.

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:42.770
In a sense, we're moving from
bubonic plague,

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:47.310
the most dreaded disease of its
era,

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.325
to--in a sense,
in terms of fear--to smallpox

00:03:51.325 --> 00:03:56.530
as the next most dreaded disease
of the next period in the

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.628
eighteenth century.
 

00:03:58.628 --> 00:04:01.340
But there's more to it that
that.

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:06.545
Smallpox, as you'll see in our
reading and in our lecture next

00:04:06.545 --> 00:04:11.836
time, was also extraordinarily
important in terms of its impact

00:04:11.836 --> 00:04:13.628
in the New World.
 

00:04:13.628 --> 00:04:17.944
It led to a demographic
catastrophe for the Native

00:04:17.944 --> 00:04:22.137
American population,
largely spontaneously,

00:04:22.137 --> 00:04:27.949
but there were also intentional
acts of genocide involved.

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:31.574
So, we're going to see,
in terms of one of the themes

00:04:31.574 --> 00:04:34.303
of our course,
that disease,

00:04:34.303 --> 00:04:39.946
and particularly smallpox,
played an important role in the

00:04:39.946 --> 00:04:44.533
big picture of history;
in conditioning or creating

00:04:44.533 --> 00:04:50.744
factors that were important in
European settlement in the New

00:04:50.744 --> 00:04:53.425
World,
and that led to the

00:04:53.425 --> 00:04:58.307
introduction of African slavery,
as the Native American

00:04:58.307 --> 00:05:03.240
population had no immunity and
perished from smallpox,

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.410
and therefore could not be
enslaved;

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:09.911
whereas Africans,
possessing immunity,

00:05:09.911 --> 00:05:12.939
were imported to replace them.
 

00:05:12.939 --> 00:05:17.826
Another major feature and
reason for dealing with smallpox

00:05:17.826 --> 00:05:23.055
has to do with another theme of
our course, and that is public

00:05:23.055 --> 00:05:24.000
health.
 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.930
We've already dealt with plague
measures of public health.

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:32.103
You know what they are,
the plague measures:

00:05:32.103 --> 00:05:35.988
boards of health,
quarantine, lazarettos,

00:05:35.988 --> 00:05:40.940
sanitary cordons,
emergency burial regulations.

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:45.264
Smallpox, by contrast,
was to lead to a very different

00:05:45.264 --> 00:05:49.019
but highly effective style of
public health;

00:05:49.019 --> 00:05:54.023
that is, first inoculation and
then vaccination,

00:05:54.023 --> 00:05:57.430
associated with Edward Jenner.
 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:01.069
Even more spectacularly than
plague measures,

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:06.870
vaccination ultimately promoted
a victory over smallpox,

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:11.480
leading in 1980 to its total
global eradication,

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:15.120
at least naturally occurring
smallpox;

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:20.880
the first, and still as we
speak, the only human disease to

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:24.160
be so intentionally eradicated.
 

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:29.670
Unlike plague measures,
vaccination was a powerful tool

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:31.610
of public health.
 

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:35.696
Successful vaccines have
subsequently been developed

00:06:35.696 --> 00:06:38.901
against other diseases:
measles, rubella,

00:06:38.901 --> 00:06:41.706
whooping cough,
tetanus, diphtheria,

00:06:41.706 --> 00:06:43.310
rabies, polio.
 

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:47.690
But again, like plague
measures, vaccines have been

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:51.916
controversial--
and we'll be talking about when

00:06:51.916 --> 00:06:55.449
vaccines form an appropriate
strategy--

00:06:55.449 --> 00:07:00.692
and eradication has been ever
more elusive for diseases other

00:07:00.692 --> 00:07:02.088
than smallpox.
 

00:07:02.088 --> 00:07:05.665
It may be that smallpox is a
special case,

00:07:05.665 --> 00:07:07.932
rather than,
as many hoped,

00:07:07.932 --> 00:07:12.466
a model for the eradication of
diseases sequentially,

00:07:12.466 --> 00:07:14.560
one after another.
 

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:18.331
We'll be looking also at
smallpox because of its

00:07:18.331 --> 00:07:21.139
demographic and economic
effects.

00:07:21.139 --> 00:07:26.716
We talked, in terms of plague,
of a mortality revolution,

00:07:26.716 --> 00:07:31.497
in terms of demography,
and also of its impact on

00:07:31.497 --> 00:07:33.690
industrialization.
 

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:38.884
Smallpox and the successful
containment of smallpox through

00:07:38.884 --> 00:07:44.079
inoculation and vaccination also
had a major impact on that

00:07:44.079 --> 00:07:49.283
mortality revolution,
and therefore also on economic

00:07:49.283 --> 00:07:50.529
development.
 

00:07:50.529 --> 00:07:54.310
We'll be looking also at
cultural impact,

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:59.226
and we'll see that smallpox
also produced the cult of

00:07:59.226 --> 00:08:03.999
certain new saints;
that it too became a theme in

00:08:03.999 --> 00:08:06.240
the arts and literature.
 

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:10.233
More speculatively,
we talked last time about the

00:08:10.233 --> 00:08:15.225
possible relationship of the
successful conquest of plague on

00:08:15.225 --> 00:08:18.220
the coming of the Enlightenment.
 

00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:22.899
Well, smallpox provides us with
a second instance of the

00:08:22.899 --> 00:08:28.007
successful deployment of human
means to control a major cause

00:08:28.007 --> 00:08:33.182
of death and anguish,
making life more secure and

00:08:33.182 --> 00:08:34.058
longer.
 

00:08:34.058 --> 00:08:38.928
It's suggested that a number of
leading philosophes were

00:08:38.928 --> 00:08:43.090
avid proponents of inoculation,
including Voltaire and

00:08:43.090 --> 00:08:44.190
Condorcet.
 

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:47.190
So, we'll be dealing with those
issues.

00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:50.985
But this morning what I'd like
to do is to concentrate on

00:08:50.985 --> 00:08:55.275
something more narrow,
which is--but forms the basis

00:08:55.275 --> 00:09:00.110
for our understanding of the
impact of this disease--

00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:02.580
its nature as a disease.
 

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:07.871
How it affects the individual
human body, and what were the

00:09:07.871 --> 00:09:12.798
treatments in the seventeenth,
eighteenth centuries.

00:09:12.798 --> 00:09:16.570
Let's begin with smallpox as a
disease.

00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:20.822
Smallpox, often nicknamed,
for reasons we'll soon see,

00:09:20.822 --> 00:09:23.629
"the speckled
monster."

00:09:23.629 --> 00:09:31.102
It's a virus belonging to the
family of orthopox viruses that

00:09:31.102 --> 00:09:37.828
includes Variola major,
Variola minor and

00:09:37.828 --> 00:09:39.200
cowpox.
 

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:43.988
We'll talk about cowpox next
time, because of its influence

00:09:43.988 --> 00:09:46.960
in the development of
vaccination.

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:50.432
But our theme will concern
Variola major and

00:09:50.432 --> 00:09:53.888
Variola minor;
especially Variola

00:09:53.888 --> 00:09:57.339
major, which is the
causative agent,

00:09:57.339 --> 00:09:59.639
primarily, of smallpox.
 

00:09:59.639 --> 00:10:06.240
This is a picture of Variola
major, the largest of all

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:11.519
viruses, first seen by the
microscope in 1905.

00:10:11.519 --> 00:10:14.519
This causes classical smallpox.
 

00:10:14.519 --> 00:10:18.519
There's Variola minor as
well, that first appeared in the

00:10:18.519 --> 00:10:22.832
twentieth century;
and for our purposes we can

00:10:22.832 --> 00:10:25.200
afford to ignore it.
 

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:30.827
It was of minor impact and now,
like Variola major,

00:10:30.827 --> 00:10:33.100
it's extinct as well.
 

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:38.620
Now, one question is,
what's a virus?

00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:42.029
We talked about the term
microbe;

00:10:42.029 --> 00:10:46.190
microbe being a generic term
for microscopic organisms,

00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:50.153
including bacteria,
like our friend Yersinia

00:10:50.153 --> 00:10:53.774
pestis,
the causative agent of bubonic

00:10:53.774 --> 00:10:56.571
plague,
and viruses like Variola

00:10:56.571 --> 00:10:59.408
major and Variola
minor,

00:10:59.408 --> 00:11:02.788
the pathogens that cause
smallpox.

00:11:02.788 --> 00:11:05.950
Plague was caused by bacteria,
and those,

00:11:05.950 --> 00:11:11.308
as you know--and will be
studying more on Science Hill--

00:11:11.308 --> 00:11:17.687
are unicellular organisms that
are definitely and unequivocally

00:11:17.687 --> 00:11:18.509
alive.
 

00:11:18.509 --> 00:11:21.009
They reproduce by dividing.
 

00:11:21.009 --> 00:11:25.147
They contain DNA,
plus all the cellular machinery

00:11:25.147 --> 00:11:28.940
necessary to read it,
and to produce the many

00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:33.250
proteins that enable it to live
and reproduce.

00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:36.298
Viruses are something different.
 

00:11:36.298 --> 00:11:40.476
And here there's a possible
confusion lurking for the

00:11:40.476 --> 00:11:41.440
historian.
 

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:45.320
The word "virus"
itself is ancient.

00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:48.937
In the humoral system,
in fact, when diseases were

00:11:48.937 --> 00:11:53.220
seen to arise from assaults on
the body on the outside,

00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:58.874
one of the major environmental
insults that was thought to lead

00:11:58.874 --> 00:12:03.070
to disease was the corrupted air
or miasma,

00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:07.110
and this was influenced by a
poison,

00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:09.620
that might be called a virus.
 

00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:12.662
So, if you do research on
medical history,

00:12:12.662 --> 00:12:15.333
you'll see the term
"virus"

00:12:15.333 --> 00:12:18.600
used in an old sense for many
centuries.

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:22.590
But "virus"
in present medical discourse is

00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:27.042
a term that dates its modern
usage from the early twentieth

00:12:27.042 --> 00:12:30.537
century,
and it refers to parasitic

00:12:30.537 --> 00:12:35.221
particles,
perhaps 500 times smaller than

00:12:35.221 --> 00:12:36.399
bacteria.
 

00:12:36.399 --> 00:12:41.178
Their existence was established
by elegant scientific

00:12:41.178 --> 00:12:45.316
experiments in the first years
of the century,

00:12:45.316 --> 00:12:47.889
completed by about 1903.
 

00:12:47.889 --> 00:12:52.315
But they couldn't actually be
seen until the invention of

00:12:52.315 --> 00:12:55.158
electron microscope in the
1930s,

00:12:55.158 --> 00:13:00.413
and their functioning wasn't
understood until the DNA

00:13:00.413 --> 00:13:03.038
revolution of the 1950s.
 

00:13:03.038 --> 00:13:05.381
So, viruses,
we now know,

00:13:05.381 --> 00:13:11.432
consist of some of the elements
of life, stripped to their most

00:13:11.432 --> 00:13:12.408
basic.
 

00:13:12.408 --> 00:13:17.514
A virus really is nothing more
than a piece of genetic material

00:13:17.514 --> 00:13:19.820
wrapped in a protein case.
 

00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:25.019
They're particles that are
inert on their own.

00:13:25.019 --> 00:13:30.744
Viruses lack the machinery to
read DNA, or to make proteins,

00:13:30.744 --> 00:13:34.139
or carry out metabolic
processes.

00:13:34.139 --> 00:13:39.312
They can do nothing on their
own, and they cannot reproduce

00:13:39.312 --> 00:13:40.740
by themselves.
 

00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:46.519
Their survival depends instead
on invading living cells.

00:13:46.519 --> 00:13:51.154
Once inside,
they highjack the cell and its

00:13:51.154 --> 00:13:52.480
machinery.
 

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:55.500
The genetic code of the
virus--and the virus,

00:13:55.500 --> 00:14:00.836
after all, is almost nothing
else--gives the cell the message

00:14:00.836 --> 00:14:04.038
it needs to reproduce more
virus,

00:14:04.038 --> 00:14:09.860
thus transforming cells into
virus producing factories,

00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:14.009
and in the process they destroy
the host cell.

00:14:14.009 --> 00:14:16.950
As they produce more and more
viruses,

00:14:16.950 --> 00:14:21.307
and destroy more and more
cells, the effect on the human

00:14:21.307 --> 00:14:24.629
body can be severe,
even catastrophic,

00:14:24.629 --> 00:14:29.803
depending on the capacity of
the immune system to contain or

00:14:29.803 --> 00:14:31.908
destroy the invasion.
 

00:14:31.908 --> 00:14:34.984
Here we have,
in a sense, the opposite of a

00:14:34.984 --> 00:14:38.953
Hippocratic idea of disease;
the body assaulted,

00:14:38.953 --> 00:14:43.437
not from the outside,
but rather from a parasitic

00:14:43.437 --> 00:14:45.678
pathogen deep within.
 

00:14:45.678 --> 00:14:50.120
There is an exotic debate,
of course--are viruses alive?

00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:55.303
Those who argue that they are
alive, note that they're capable

00:14:55.303 --> 00:14:59.298
of transmitting genetic
material, one of the key

00:14:59.298 --> 00:15:01.340
indications of life.
 

00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:05.783
Those who claim they're not
alive, note that on their own

00:15:05.783 --> 00:15:08.798
they're inert,
that they can't carry on

00:15:08.798 --> 00:15:12.370
metabolic processes,
or produce proteins.

00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:17.038
Viruses, they note,
are the ultimate parasites.

00:15:17.038 --> 00:15:21.496
Virologists often say that
whether you decide that viruses

00:15:21.496 --> 00:15:25.720
are alive or not is ultimately a
matter or disciplinary

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:29.243
perspective,
or perhaps even personal

00:15:29.243 --> 00:15:30.340
preference.
 

00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:35.265
The reassuring point for us is
that, perhaps excepting

00:15:35.265 --> 00:15:39.450
theology, the answer doesn't
really matter.

00:15:39.450 --> 00:15:42.976
In any case,
what we need to know is that

00:15:42.976 --> 00:15:48.355
smallpox was caused by a virus,
and a virus that has no animal

00:15:48.355 --> 00:15:49.590
reservoir.
 

00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:53.642
The disease was restricted
entirely to human beings,

00:15:53.642 --> 00:15:57.375
and that will prove to be
important in making it

00:15:57.375 --> 00:16:01.190
eventually a good candidate for
eradication.

00:16:01.190 --> 00:16:04.164
The name for the virus,
Variola,

00:16:04.164 --> 00:16:06.984
derives from the Latin
varius,

00:16:06.984 --> 00:16:08.548
meaning spotted.
 

00:16:08.548 --> 00:16:12.620
And in England the disease,
in fact, was popularly called,

00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:14.833
as I've said,
"the speckled

00:16:14.833 --> 00:16:16.120
monster."
 

00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:20.731
So, here's a picture of the
smallpox virus--oops,

00:16:20.731 --> 00:16:24.240
it's gone out;
there it is.

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:30.860
And that's a schematic image of
a smallpox virus.

00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:33.504
And as I said,
there is a mutation that

00:16:33.504 --> 00:16:37.192
occurred in the twentieth
century, causing the rise of

00:16:37.192 --> 00:16:40.115
Variola minor,
as well as Variola

00:16:40.115 --> 00:16:41.230
major.
 

00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:44.886
But we'll be concerned
exclusively here with Variola

00:16:44.886 --> 00:16:48.378
major;
the main cause of smallpox

00:16:48.378 --> 00:16:49.820
historically.
 

00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:53.210
Well, how was it transmitted?
 

00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:58.072
Here we need to remember that
smallpox is an exceedingly

00:16:58.072 --> 00:16:59.928
contagious disease.
 

00:16:59.928 --> 00:17:04.972
A smallpox patient sheds
millions of infective viruses

00:17:04.972 --> 00:17:08.970
into his or her immediate
surroundings,

00:17:08.970 --> 00:17:14.759
from the rash and from the open
sores in the sufferer's throat.

00:17:14.759 --> 00:17:20.285
The patient is infective from
just before the onset of the

00:17:20.285 --> 00:17:25.519
rash until the very last scab
falls off weeks later.

00:17:25.519 --> 00:17:28.586
Not everyone,
of course, who is exposed is

00:17:28.586 --> 00:17:29.410
infected.
 

00:17:29.410 --> 00:17:33.009
Living along with people with
immunity--

00:17:33.009 --> 00:17:37.788
and leaving that aside--it has
been estimated that the chances

00:17:37.788 --> 00:17:41.315
are about 50:50 that a
susceptible member of a

00:17:41.315 --> 00:17:45.624
household would contract
smallpox from an ill patient in

00:17:45.624 --> 00:17:46.798
the home.
 

00:17:46.798 --> 00:17:53.064
The dominant manner to spread
smallpox was by contact

00:17:53.064 --> 00:17:56.837
infection,
droplets breathed out in

00:17:56.837 --> 00:18:02.083
face-to-face contact with a
susceptible person and inhaled

00:18:02.083 --> 00:18:03.740
by that person.
 

00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:08.894
Normally the spread was in the
context of intense contact over

00:18:08.894 --> 00:18:12.486
a period of time;
that is, a family member,

00:18:12.486 --> 00:18:17.141
or someone on a hospital ward,
in an enclosed workplace--an

00:18:17.141 --> 00:18:19.682
office,
a factory, a mine--a school

00:18:19.682 --> 00:18:24.028
classroom,
an army barrack, a refugee camp.

00:18:24.028 --> 00:18:29.330
And it's most easily
transmitted in dry,

00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:31.368
cool seasons.
 

00:18:31.368 --> 00:18:35.279
That's the primary mode of
transmission.

00:18:35.279 --> 00:18:40.180
There are two more,
however, that are more

00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:42.930
relatively secondary.
 

00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:48.266
A second mode of transmission
is by what are called--another

00:18:48.266 --> 00:18:50.980
bit of jargon here--fomites.
 

00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:55.618
A fomite is simply an inanimate
object, capable of carrying

00:18:55.618 --> 00:18:59.538
infectious material from one
person to another.

00:18:59.538 --> 00:19:03.660
Examples might be bed linen,
clothing;

00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:08.694
the shroud from an infected
person that transmits viruses

00:19:08.694 --> 00:19:13.279
from one body--that is,
of the sufferer--to the next

00:19:13.279 --> 00:19:14.269
person.
 

00:19:14.269 --> 00:19:18.827
Other examples are simply
doorknobs, eating utensils,

00:19:18.827 --> 00:19:19.880
and so on.
 

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:22.798
So, that's a second mode of
transmission.

00:19:22.798 --> 00:19:26.674
There's a third too,
that smallpox can be vertically

00:19:26.674 --> 00:19:31.930
transmitted;
that is, from mother to infant.

00:19:31.930 --> 00:19:37.452
It's possible for an infant to
be born with congenital

00:19:37.452 --> 00:19:38.598
smallpox.
 

00:19:38.598 --> 00:19:42.359
Well, that's the mode of
transmission.

00:19:42.359 --> 00:19:45.730
What about its epidemiology?
 

00:19:45.730 --> 00:19:51.808
Well, some favoring factors
include large urban populations.

00:19:51.808 --> 00:19:57.259
It's not coincidental that
smallpox raged in Western Europe

00:19:57.259 --> 00:19:59.890
in the eighteenth century.
 

00:19:59.890 --> 00:20:04.980
The crowded living conditions
and workplaces were ideal for

00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:06.650
its transmission.
 

00:20:06.650 --> 00:20:10.641
Trade and the movement of
people, displaced people,

00:20:10.641 --> 00:20:11.440
warfare.
 

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:16.133
People who assembled and
reassembled in crowds were ideal

00:20:16.133 --> 00:20:18.480
for transmitting smallpox.
 

00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:22.980
The disease is known to have
afflicted Ancient Egypt.

00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:28.700
Mummies are known to have been
victims of smallpox.

00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:33.240
But the important point is that
it became endemic in Europe,

00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:36.680
that became the world reservoir
of infection,

00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:39.700
from which it spread by trade,
colonization,

00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:41.690
warfare.
 

00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:44.902
And in European cities it
became, above all,

00:20:44.902 --> 00:20:46.769
a disease of childhood.
 

00:20:46.769 --> 00:20:52.079
But about a third of the deaths
of children in the seventeenth

00:20:52.079 --> 00:20:54.779
century were due to smallpox.
 

00:20:54.779 --> 00:20:58.694
So, a reason then for dealing
with smallpox now,

00:20:58.694 --> 00:21:01.943
in our course,
is that it was on a major

00:21:01.943 --> 00:21:06.609
upsurge in the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries.

00:21:06.609 --> 00:21:07.920
How was it named?
 

00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:10.390
Why is it called smallpox?
 

00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:11.190
A small point.
 

00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:15.137
But we need to know that it's
from a comparative description

00:21:15.137 --> 00:21:17.278
of its characteristic lesions.
 

00:21:17.278 --> 00:21:20.346
The "great pox"
is a disease which we'll be

00:21:20.346 --> 00:21:23.805
dealing with pretty soon,
which was syphilis,

00:21:23.805 --> 00:21:28.269
that creates large lesions and
affects adults.

00:21:28.269 --> 00:21:35.298
The smallpox had small lesions
and primarily affected children;

00:21:35.298 --> 00:21:39.460
at least in countries in which
it was endemic.

00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:44.372
Another point we should know
about smallpox is that after

00:21:44.372 --> 00:21:48.670
infection, a person enjoys a
lifelong immunity.

00:21:48.670 --> 00:21:52.948
We need to know that because
it's a major factor in the

00:21:52.948 --> 00:21:57.940
public health measures that the
disease eventually generated.

00:21:57.940 --> 00:21:59.808
Well, what about its symptoms?
 

00:21:59.808 --> 00:22:04.118
How does it affect the
individual human body?

00:22:04.118 --> 00:22:09.083
After inhaling the virus,
there's an incubation period,

00:22:09.083 --> 00:22:13.680
which normally lasts something
like twelve days.

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:18.138
This is important in its
epidemiology because it allowed

00:22:18.138 --> 00:22:22.932
the spread of the disease;
because an infected person had

00:22:22.932 --> 00:22:27.809
ample time to travel before
falling ill, and therefore time

00:22:27.809 --> 00:22:32.519
to take the disease with him or
her and to spread it.

00:22:32.519 --> 00:22:37.040
Now, I'm going to give some
attention--perhaps more than you

00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:41.103
might like when you see the
images--to the symptoms of

00:22:41.103 --> 00:22:42.099
smallpox.
 

00:22:42.099 --> 00:22:44.618
And there's a reason for that.
 

00:22:44.618 --> 00:22:48.621
Part is that smallpox is
tremendously,

00:22:48.621 --> 00:22:52.190
terribly, terrifyingly painful.
 

00:22:52.190 --> 00:22:55.450
Plus it leads--and this is
important too,

00:22:55.450 --> 00:22:58.640
in the way that it impacted
society--

00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:02.078
it often produces lifelong
scarring,

00:23:02.078 --> 00:23:07.988
disfiguring and blindness,
and these in turn spread fear

00:23:07.988 --> 00:23:10.028
of it and terror.
 

00:23:10.028 --> 00:23:15.943
And, so, the very word smallpox
has a particular resonance in

00:23:15.943 --> 00:23:20.380
popular imagination,
associated with dread.

00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:23.942
People sometimes ask,
in a course like this,

00:23:23.942 --> 00:23:28.750
which of the diseases we
encounter was really the worst?

00:23:28.750 --> 00:23:33.430
The question doesn't permit
empirical verification,

00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:36.750
because no one has ever
suffered, mercifully,

00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:41.432
all the afflictions we study
and had the opportunity to

00:23:41.432 --> 00:23:42.298
compare.
 

00:23:42.298 --> 00:23:46.895
But it is meaningful to note
the impression of those who

00:23:46.895 --> 00:23:51.827
lived through the times when
smallpox claimed its legions of

00:23:51.827 --> 00:23:52.828
victims.
 

00:23:52.828 --> 00:23:55.732
They thought--and the
physicians who treated

00:23:55.732 --> 00:23:59.380
them--that smallpox was the
worst of human maladies;

00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:02.858
that was a term that was said
at the time.

00:24:02.858 --> 00:24:05.351
And this, in fact,
was the view,

00:24:05.351 --> 00:24:08.968
closer to home,
of the Illinois State Board of

00:24:08.968 --> 00:24:11.380
Health in 1902,
where Dr.

00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:16.692
Donald Hopkins wrote this:
"In the suddenness and

00:24:16.692 --> 00:24:22.670
unpredictability of its attack,
in the grotesque torture of its

00:24:22.670 --> 00:24:26.493
victims,
in the brutality of its lethal

00:24:26.493 --> 00:24:31.865
or disfiguring outcome,
and in the dread that it

00:24:31.865 --> 00:24:35.818
inspired, smallpox is the worst.
 

00:24:35.818 --> 00:24:40.170
It's unique among human
diseases."

00:24:40.170 --> 00:24:45.259
To the extent that that's true,
it's also one of the reasons

00:24:45.259 --> 00:24:49.743
that smallpox appeals to the
malevolent as a possible

00:24:49.743 --> 00:24:52.160
instrument of bioterror.
 

00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:56.625
It's well-known that a major
outbreak of smallpox would

00:24:56.625 --> 00:24:59.271
spread death,
maximize suffering,

00:24:59.271 --> 00:25:04.400
and lead to widespread fear,
flight and social disruption.

00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:09.335
The symptoms are important to
examine as an integral part of

00:25:09.335 --> 00:25:10.588
this disease.
 

00:25:10.588 --> 00:25:13.982
And more generally,
unless we appreciate the

00:25:13.982 --> 00:25:18.640
distinctive symptoms of each of
the diseases we examine,

00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:23.180
there's a distorting temptation
to allow them to run together,

00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:27.263
the diseases,
as so many interchangeable

00:25:27.263 --> 00:25:31.314
causes of death;
a point of view that prevents

00:25:31.314 --> 00:25:36.017
us from understanding that each
of these epidemic diseases had a

00:25:36.017 --> 00:25:38.779
distinctive and different
imprint.

00:25:38.779 --> 00:25:43.568
Smallpox was the disease that
it was, in part because of the

00:25:43.568 --> 00:25:47.930
dread that it generated;
fear not only of death,

00:25:47.930 --> 00:25:51.843
but also of exquisite
suffering, maiming,

00:25:51.843 --> 00:25:54.680
disfiguring and blindness.
 

00:25:54.680 --> 00:26:00.022
Only with that in mind,
can we understand why it's also

00:26:00.022 --> 00:26:05.170
so widely thought to be a
candidate for bioterror.

00:26:05.170 --> 00:26:08.160
So, we'll look at images of the
disease.

00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:13.026
And I apologize to those of you
who've just finished breakfast

00:26:13.026 --> 00:26:15.420
or just about to have lunch.
 

00:26:15.420 --> 00:26:19.518
In any case,
first after the incubation

00:26:19.518 --> 00:26:23.940
period, there's the pre-eruptive
stage.

00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:29.623
The virus multiplies in the
system for twelve days after

00:26:29.623 --> 00:26:34.423
incubation,
and symptoms of disease begin

00:26:34.423 --> 00:26:38.970
with a viral shower,
as the pathogen is released

00:26:38.970 --> 00:26:43.343
into the bloodstream and spreads
systemically throughout the

00:26:43.343 --> 00:26:46.410
body,
localizing eventually in the

00:26:46.410 --> 00:26:51.263
blood vessels of the skin,
just below the superficial

00:26:51.263 --> 00:26:52.019
layers.
 

00:26:52.019 --> 00:26:56.509
The viral load released,
and the efficiency of the

00:26:56.509 --> 00:27:01.458
body's immune response,
determine the severity and type

00:27:01.458 --> 00:27:03.200
of the disease.
 

00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:07.933
Onset is sudden,
with fever of 100 to 102

00:27:07.933 --> 00:27:11.838
degrees, and a general malaise.
 

00:27:11.838 --> 00:27:17.586
This, then, is the beginning of
perhaps a month of excruciating

00:27:17.586 --> 00:27:22.220
suffering and the danger of
spreading contagion.

00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:27.496
The early symptoms are fever,
vomiting, severe backache,

00:27:27.496 --> 00:27:32.484
splitting frontal headache,
and in children sometimes

00:27:32.484 --> 00:27:34.019
convulsions.
 

00:27:34.019 --> 00:27:38.338
Sometimes the disease is so
overwhelming that it leads to

00:27:38.338 --> 00:27:41.269
what's called fulminating
smallpox,

00:27:41.269 --> 00:27:44.400
which causes death within
thirty-six hours,

00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:48.038
with no outward manifestations
at all;

00:27:48.038 --> 00:27:52.230
although post-mortem exams
reveal hemorrhages in the

00:27:52.230 --> 00:27:55.930
respiratory tract,
the alimentary tract or the

00:27:55.930 --> 00:27:57.410
heart muscles.
 

00:27:57.410 --> 00:28:02.862
Let me give you a description
of a hyper-acute case of that

00:28:02.862 --> 00:28:03.519
kind.
 

00:28:03.519 --> 00:28:07.278
Physicians wrote:
"After three to four days,

00:28:07.278 --> 00:28:12.316
the patient has the general
aspect of someone who's passed

00:28:12.316 --> 00:28:15.940
through a long and exhausting
struggle.

00:28:15.940 --> 00:28:19.814
His face has lost all
expression, is mask-like,

00:28:19.814 --> 00:28:23.519
and there's a wont of tone in
all muscles.

00:28:23.519 --> 00:28:26.868
When he speaks,
this condition becomes more

00:28:26.868 --> 00:28:30.138
apparent, speaking as with
evident effort,

00:28:30.138 --> 00:28:33.328
and the voice is low and
monotonous.

00:28:33.328 --> 00:28:37.769
The patient is listless and
indifferent to surroundings.

00:28:37.769 --> 00:28:40.220
The mental attitude is similar.
 

00:28:40.220 --> 00:28:44.645
There's a loss of tension,
a lengthening of reaction time,

00:28:44.645 --> 00:28:46.509
and defective control.
 

00:28:46.509 --> 00:28:50.432
In the most fulminant cases,
the aspect of the patient

00:28:50.432 --> 00:28:54.577
resembles that of someone
suffering from severe shock and

00:28:54.577 --> 00:28:55.910
loss of blood.
 

00:28:55.910 --> 00:28:57.970
The face is drawn and pallid.
 

00:28:57.970 --> 00:29:00.990
Respiration is sighing or
gasping.

00:29:00.990 --> 00:29:05.578
The patient tosses about
continually, and cries out.

00:29:05.578 --> 00:29:09.779
His attention is fixed with
difficulty, and he complains

00:29:09.779 --> 00:29:13.038
only of agonizing pain;
now in the chest,

00:29:13.038 --> 00:29:16.848
now in the back,
the head or the abdomen."

00:29:16.848 --> 00:29:21.288
But normally smallpox wasn't
fulminant quite like that,

00:29:21.288 --> 00:29:25.278
and the patient passed on to
the next phase,

00:29:25.278 --> 00:29:30.404
which was the eruptive one,
exhibiting the classical

00:29:30.404 --> 00:29:35.328
symptoms of smallpox that led to
its diagnosis.

00:29:35.328 --> 00:29:39.875
On the third day after onset,
the patient usually felt a

00:29:39.875 --> 00:29:43.713
little better,
and in mild cases he or she

00:29:43.713 --> 00:29:46.960
could return to normal
activities,

00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:51.705
with the unfortunate effect
that this spread the disease

00:29:51.705 --> 00:29:52.568
further.
 

00:29:52.568 --> 00:29:56.480
But concurrently a rash
appeared;

00:29:56.480 --> 00:30:00.289
a small round or oval,
rose-colored lesion,

00:30:00.289 --> 00:30:03.193
known as a macule,
that's up to a

00:30:03.193 --> 00:30:06.368
quarter-of-an-inch in diameter.
 

00:30:06.368 --> 00:30:09.990
The macules appeared first on
the tongue and palate,

00:30:09.990 --> 00:30:12.759
and then, within twenty-four
hours,

00:30:12.759 --> 00:30:17.796
it spread to cover the body,
down to the palms of the hands

00:30:17.796 --> 00:30:19.880
and soles of the feet.
 

00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:24.090
On the cheek and forehead,
the appearance is of severe

00:30:24.090 --> 00:30:28.461
sunburn, and indeed the
sensation felt by the patient is

00:30:28.461 --> 00:30:31.640
of scalding pain or intense
burning.

00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:35.333
There's a characteristic
pattern, called centrifugal

00:30:35.333 --> 00:30:39.597
distribution;
that is, that the rash is least

00:30:39.597 --> 00:30:46.057
spread on the trunk of the body
and most densely apparent on the

00:30:46.057 --> 00:30:48.930
face and the extremities.
 

00:30:48.930 --> 00:30:52.769
Let me show you a slide of a
very ill little boy,

00:30:52.769 --> 00:30:57.031
and you can see this
centrifugal pattern in which the

00:30:57.031 --> 00:31:00.640
rash is most apparent on the
extremities,

00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:03.519
rather than the trunk.
 

00:31:03.519 --> 00:31:08.083
On day two of the rash,
a little further into the

00:31:08.083 --> 00:31:11.028
infection, the lesions alter.
 

00:31:11.028 --> 00:31:17.231
At this time the macule becomes
harder, and generally rises

00:31:17.231 --> 00:31:22.578
above the surface into
structures known as papules,

00:31:22.578 --> 00:31:25.358
with a flattened apex.
 

00:31:25.358 --> 00:31:27.347
To the touch,
they were said,

00:31:27.347 --> 00:31:30.472
by physicians,
to feel like buckshot embodied

00:31:30.472 --> 00:31:31.608
in the skin.
 

00:31:31.608 --> 00:31:35.406
And there we can see the
picture of a face,

00:31:35.406 --> 00:31:38.210
at that stage of the disease.
 

00:31:38.210 --> 00:31:43.420
The disease then moves on,
by the fifth day of the rash,

00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:47.210
when fluid begins to accumulate
in pockmarks,

00:31:47.210 --> 00:31:51.000
which are then raised and firm
to the touch--

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:55.869
so we'll pass on--now called
vesicles.

00:31:55.869 --> 00:31:57.660
They've grown in size.
 

00:31:57.660 --> 00:32:01.730
They've changed in color from
red to bluish or purple.

00:32:01.730 --> 00:32:08.039
And they've transformed from
solid to blister-like fluid.

00:32:08.039 --> 00:32:10.288
It's umbilicated as well.
 

00:32:10.288 --> 00:32:13.924
The process of what's called
vesiculation,

00:32:13.924 --> 00:32:19.334
the rise of this stage of the
rash, takes about three days and

00:32:19.334 --> 00:32:21.640
lasts a further three.
 

00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:25.883
It's at this stage that the
physical diagnosis of smallpox

00:32:25.883 --> 00:32:29.457
becomes reliable,
with the disease presenting its

00:32:29.457 --> 00:32:31.838
most distinctive appearance.
 

00:32:31.838 --> 00:32:35.821
The patient experiences
increasing difficulty in

00:32:35.821 --> 00:32:40.851
swallowing and in talking,
due to extensive lesions in the

00:32:40.851 --> 00:32:44.750
mucous membranes in the palate
and the throat.

00:32:44.750 --> 00:32:51.279
And there's a child at this
stage of the disease.

00:32:51.279 --> 00:32:57.653
Then by the sixth day of the
rash, pus begins to form in the

00:32:57.653 --> 00:32:58.950
pockmarks.
 

00:32:58.950 --> 00:33:01.829
The patient feels much worse.
 

00:33:01.829 --> 00:33:05.328
Septicemia can set in.
 

00:33:05.328 --> 00:33:08.063
The pustules,
as they're now called,

00:33:08.063 --> 00:33:12.280
begin to fill with yellow
fluid, and the lesions become

00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:16.509
globular in shape;
a process that takes about two

00:33:16.509 --> 00:33:21.113
days, and they're fully matured
on the eighth day of the

00:33:21.113 --> 00:33:22.618
eruptive phase.
 

00:33:22.618 --> 00:33:25.509
The patient feels dreadful at
this point.

00:33:25.509 --> 00:33:30.368
Fever has risen in proportion
to the severity of the attack.

00:33:30.368 --> 00:33:33.433
The eyelids,
lips, nose and tongue are

00:33:33.433 --> 00:33:35.338
tremendously swollen.
 

00:33:35.338 --> 00:33:45.518
And we can see a picture of an
adult at that phase of the

00:33:45.518 --> 00:33:47.700
infection.
 

00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:51.260
At this point,
the patient is almost totally

00:33:51.260 --> 00:33:55.402
unable to swallow or talk,
and deteriorates slowly,

00:33:55.402 --> 00:34:00.038
being drowsy most of the time
and restless at night.

00:34:00.038 --> 00:34:03.673
Often he or she is in a
condition of delirium,

00:34:03.673 --> 00:34:08.139
and thrashes about;
may even try to escape.

00:34:08.139 --> 00:34:12.608
The psychological effects
weren't simply a sign of high

00:34:12.608 --> 00:34:13.268
fever.
 

00:34:13.268 --> 00:34:16.695
They resulted also from the
involvement of the central

00:34:16.695 --> 00:34:21.333
nervous system in the infection,
and the neurological effects

00:34:21.333 --> 00:34:26.251
and sequelae could often be
lasting and result in long-term

00:34:26.251 --> 00:34:27.440
impairment.
 

00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:30.610
Then, by the ninth day of the
rash,

00:34:30.610 --> 00:34:34.829
the pustules were firm and
embedded in the skin,

00:34:34.829 --> 00:34:37.773
and for this reason were
likely--and this was important

00:34:37.773 --> 00:34:41.516
in the impact of the disease--
to leave permanent scars and

00:34:41.516 --> 00:34:45.085
deep pits on the face,
or wherever they appeared on

00:34:45.085 --> 00:34:52.217
the body;
if you can imagine by at this

00:34:52.217 --> 00:34:53.780
stage.
 

00:34:53.780 --> 00:34:58.951
Another unpleasant aspect at
this stage was that a terrible

00:34:58.951 --> 00:35:03.163
sickly smell developed,
the fetor of smallpox,

00:35:03.163 --> 00:35:08.414
that physicians claimed that it
was impossible to describe but

00:35:08.414 --> 00:35:11.170
was found to be overpowering.
 

00:35:11.170 --> 00:35:15.094
It's now nearly impossible for
the patient to drink,

00:35:15.094 --> 00:35:19.172
and even milk caused intense
burning sensations in the

00:35:19.172 --> 00:35:20.018
throat.
 

00:35:20.018 --> 00:35:24.389
The patient experiences great
loss in weight--as much as

00:35:24.389 --> 00:35:29.157
thirty to forty pounds in an
adult--and may suffer from frank

00:35:29.157 --> 00:35:30.349
starvation.
 

00:35:30.349 --> 00:35:32.715
In addition,
there's a complete loss of

00:35:32.715 --> 00:35:34.682
muscle tone,
while the face,

00:35:34.682 --> 00:35:37.713
in severe cases,
takes on the appearance of a

00:35:37.713 --> 00:35:40.867
cadaver,
making the patient almost

00:35:40.867 --> 00:35:45.056
unrecognizable,
even to his or her closest

00:35:45.056 --> 00:35:46.159
relatives.
 

00:35:46.159 --> 00:35:50.800
The scalp may be one large
lesion, and tangled with hair.

00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:53.411
And lesions,
as you can imagine,

00:35:53.411 --> 00:35:58.719
under the nails of fingers and
toes were exquisitely painful.

00:35:58.719 --> 00:36:02.478
I want to show another
disturbing image--this was

00:36:02.478 --> 00:36:07.019
important, but you can look away
if you like--which was the

00:36:07.019 --> 00:36:08.900
lesions of the eyes.
 

00:36:08.900 --> 00:36:12.880
Because smallpox was a major
cause of blindness,

00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:15.760
as well as death and
disfigurement,

00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:17.369
in this period.
 

00:36:17.369 --> 00:36:22.320
Well, after about ten to
fourteen days of rash,

00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:26.518
scabs appear,
and these contain live smallpox

00:36:26.518 --> 00:36:30.876
virus as well,
and are highly infective and

00:36:30.876 --> 00:36:35.860
important in the spread of the
disease by fomites.

00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:40.226
At this point,
the fluid portion of the

00:36:40.226 --> 00:36:46.320
pustule is absorbed,
leaving behind the solid part.

00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:50.244
Large areas of the skin may
begin to peel off,

00:36:50.244 --> 00:36:53.820
leaving deeper tissues raw and
exposed.

00:36:53.820 --> 00:36:57.235
These areas are all painful,
and contribute to the

00:36:57.235 --> 00:37:01.070
frightening appearance and the
misery of the patient.

00:37:01.070 --> 00:37:05.418
Fatal cases often occurred from
about the eighth day,

00:37:05.418 --> 00:37:10.186
and an important reason was
toxemia, because these lesions

00:37:10.186 --> 00:37:13.030
were susceptible to infection.
 

00:37:13.030 --> 00:37:16.452
So, attentive nursing,
good hygiene and sound

00:37:16.452 --> 00:37:21.429
nutrition reduced the likelihood
of that sort of complication.

00:37:21.429 --> 00:37:24.807
And, to that degree at least,
the prosperous,

00:37:24.807 --> 00:37:29.800
the well-nursed and well-cared
for were more likely to survive.

00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:33.672
The appearance of the patient
was often described by

00:37:33.672 --> 00:37:38.269
physicians as mortification;
the still living patient taking

00:37:38.269 --> 00:37:41.190
on the appearance of being
mummified,

00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:45.650
and the skin of the face fixed
in a grotesque mask,

00:37:45.650 --> 00:37:48.710
with the mouth permanently open.
 

00:37:48.710 --> 00:37:52.842
The appearance of scabs and
crusting though was a favorable

00:37:52.842 --> 00:37:56.050
sign in terms of prognosis for
the patient.

00:37:56.050 --> 00:37:59.655
But they did lead to one final
torment of the disease,

00:37:59.655 --> 00:38:03.260
which was an intolerable
itching that accompanied that

00:38:03.260 --> 00:38:06.391
period;
indeed, a large portion of the

00:38:06.391 --> 00:38:10.998
scarring that resulted from
smallpox was undoubtedly due to

00:38:10.998 --> 00:38:15.130
patients scratching and tearing
at their lesions.

00:38:15.130 --> 00:38:18.971
Well, the appearance and
distribution of the pustules was

00:38:18.971 --> 00:38:21.510
of major importance for
diagnosis,

00:38:21.510 --> 00:38:25.860
and it could be what was called
"discrete smallpox,"

00:38:25.860 --> 00:38:31.148
where the rash was--
each lesion was distinct and

00:38:31.148 --> 00:38:34.469
separated from the next.
 

00:38:34.469 --> 00:38:39.699
And this meant that you had a
case fatality rate of as low as

00:38:39.699 --> 00:38:44.931
about nine percent;
you had a ninety percent chance

00:38:44.931 --> 00:38:46.360
of survival.
 

00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:49.251
If instead the lesions were
much closer

00:38:49.251 --> 00:38:53.896
together--semi-confluent it was
called--the case fatality rate

00:38:53.896 --> 00:38:57.550
rose to something like
thirty-seven percent.

00:38:57.550 --> 00:39:02.119
Or in cases of what was called
"confluent smallpox,"

00:39:02.119 --> 00:39:06.614
in which the lesions touched
one another and formed a network

00:39:06.614 --> 00:39:10.059
surrounded by islands of
unaffected skin,

00:39:10.059 --> 00:39:15.079
the case fatality rate was
about sixty-five percent.

00:39:15.079 --> 00:39:19.155
So, the appearance of the
lesions was very important in

00:39:19.155 --> 00:39:20.440
your prognosis.
 

00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:24.170
The rarest form was hemorrhagic
smallpox,

00:39:24.170 --> 00:39:27.099
which had a hundred percent
mortality,

00:39:27.099 --> 00:39:30.626
so-called because the natural
clotting mechanisms of the blood

00:39:30.626 --> 00:39:33.659
were impaired,
and the victim died of massive

00:39:33.659 --> 00:39:35.230
internal hemorrhaging.
 

00:39:35.230 --> 00:39:41.429
Overall, the case fatality rate
for smallpox was estimated to be

00:39:41.429 --> 00:39:44.579
about thirty to forty percent.
 

00:39:44.579 --> 00:39:48.710
The virus then attacked not
only the skin and the throat,

00:39:48.710 --> 00:39:53.623
but also the lungs,
the heart, the liver and other

00:39:53.623 --> 00:39:57.235
internal organs,
and could result in

00:39:57.235 --> 00:39:59.389
hemorrhaging and death.
 

00:39:59.389 --> 00:40:03.949
A major danger was also
secondary bacterial infection of

00:40:03.949 --> 00:40:07.182
the lesions;
a very common cause of

00:40:07.182 --> 00:40:08.219
mortality.
 

00:40:08.219 --> 00:40:12.204
Meanwhile, the lesions of the
mouth and throat were of great

00:40:12.204 --> 00:40:17.159
epidemiological importance,
because they're the source of

00:40:17.159 --> 00:40:23.219
the viruses that commonly form
droplets in the air and infect

00:40:23.219 --> 00:40:24.230
others.
 

00:40:24.230 --> 00:40:27.400
Also, the tongue became swollen
and misshapen.

00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:29.079
There was difficulty breathing.
 

00:40:29.079 --> 00:40:33.130
The patient became hoarse,
swallowing was difficult.

00:40:33.130 --> 00:40:35.460
And all of that was important.
 

00:40:35.460 --> 00:40:39.472
There were other sources of
anguish and suffering:

00:40:39.472 --> 00:40:42.503
blindness, scarring and
disfigurement,

00:40:42.503 --> 00:40:44.960
respiratory complications.
 

00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:51.110
But after the drying up of the
rash, the patient began to

00:40:51.110 --> 00:40:52.210
recover.
 

00:40:52.210 --> 00:40:55.239
And among the population that
survived,

00:40:55.239 --> 00:41:00.213
the symptoms declined and the
patient regained strength and

00:41:00.213 --> 00:41:04.929
possessed a lifelong immunity
from a second exposure.

00:41:04.929 --> 00:41:08.943
All of this led,
of course, as you can imagine,

00:41:08.943 --> 00:41:13.831
to tremendous fear of the
disease--as in this picture--of

00:41:13.831 --> 00:41:15.489
Variola.
 

00:41:15.489 --> 00:41:19.320
Well, how did physicians deal
with this disease?

00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:23.320
Smallpox no longer occurs
naturally anywhere on the

00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:24.039
planet.
 

00:41:24.039 --> 00:41:28.346
But it's worth remembering that
there is still no specific

00:41:28.346 --> 00:41:30.840
remedy or cure for the disease.
 

00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:33.760
Treatment, should a case appear
today,

00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:37.878
would be largely supportive,
depending above all on

00:41:37.878 --> 00:41:41.005
intensive nursing,
to keep the lesions

00:41:41.005 --> 00:41:44.856
scrupulously clean,
to prevent bedsores and to

00:41:44.856 --> 00:41:48.050
minimize the breakdown of the
skin.

00:41:48.050 --> 00:41:51.177
In addition,
modern medicine would replace

00:41:51.177 --> 00:41:54.686
lost fluids and nutrients,
and would administer

00:41:54.686 --> 00:41:57.409
antibiotics, not to deal with
the virus,

00:41:57.409 --> 00:42:00.824
but with the bacterial
infections that are its

00:42:00.824 --> 00:42:02.039
complications.
 

00:42:02.039 --> 00:42:04.559
What were traditional remedies?
 

00:42:04.559 --> 00:42:06.949
Some of them were surprising.
 

00:42:06.949 --> 00:42:10.860
One was a great vogue in the
color red.

00:42:10.860 --> 00:42:16.057
There was a vogue to hang red
curtains around the bed of a

00:42:16.057 --> 00:42:16.969
patient.
 

00:42:16.969 --> 00:42:20.335
Red furniture was brought into
the sickroom,

00:42:20.335 --> 00:42:23.702
and patients,
including Queen Elizabeth I of

00:42:23.702 --> 00:42:26.989
England, were wrapped in red
blankets.

00:42:26.989 --> 00:42:31.505
Later on, the discovery of
ultraviolet rays in fact gave

00:42:31.505 --> 00:42:35.201
new impetus to this traditional
mania for red,

00:42:35.201 --> 00:42:38.239
and red glass went up on
windows.

00:42:38.239 --> 00:42:41.887
In the late nineteenth century,
medical journals published

00:42:41.887 --> 00:42:45.856
studies suggesting also that red
light could be soothing to the

00:42:45.856 --> 00:42:49.561
eyes of the sufferer,
and that perhaps it prevented

00:42:49.561 --> 00:42:51.110
scarring of the skin.
 

00:42:51.110 --> 00:42:53.210
So, that was one factor.
 

00:42:53.210 --> 00:42:57.318
Another idea that was very
common was to open the pustule

00:42:57.318 --> 00:43:00.619
with a golden needle,
to drain the fluid,

00:43:00.619 --> 00:43:05.648
and then sometimes the lesions
were cauterized in an attempt to

00:43:05.648 --> 00:43:08.987
prevent scarring;
procedures that were

00:43:08.987 --> 00:43:10.789
exceedingly painful.
 

00:43:10.789 --> 00:43:13.641
The next idea was what was
called "the hot

00:43:13.641 --> 00:43:16.061
regimen,"
to pile the sufferer with

00:43:16.061 --> 00:43:18.923
blankets,
to induce him or her to sweat

00:43:18.923 --> 00:43:21.739
profusely,
to rid the body of the

00:43:21.739 --> 00:43:23.639
over-abundant humor.
 

00:43:23.639 --> 00:43:27.510
Or the patient could be
immersed in a hot bath.

00:43:27.510 --> 00:43:31.045
Light and fresh air,
according to this therapeutic

00:43:31.045 --> 00:43:33.295
fashion,
were deemed to be harmful,

00:43:33.295 --> 00:43:35.480
and the patient was kept in the
dark,

00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:38.780
if possible,
with minimal ventilation.

00:43:38.780 --> 00:43:42.942
Sunlight was said to aggravate
the disease and increase

00:43:42.942 --> 00:43:43.789
scarring.
 

00:43:43.789 --> 00:43:48.800
And sometimes patients were
given internal medications,

00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:54.090
sudorifics, to help the
evacuation of the excess humor.

00:43:54.090 --> 00:43:57.373
The opposite was also tried,
the so-called "cold

00:43:57.373 --> 00:43:59.900
regimen,"
to keep the room cool,

00:43:59.900 --> 00:44:03.340
and frequently to sponge down
the patient with cold water,

00:44:03.340 --> 00:44:06.429
to place-ice bags on the face.
 

00:44:06.429 --> 00:44:12.670
Then there was purging and
bloodletting.

00:44:12.670 --> 00:44:15.711
There was also the
administration of opiates,

00:44:15.711 --> 00:44:19.170
in the nineteenth century,
and especially morphine,

00:44:19.170 --> 00:44:21.659
to calm the patient in
delirium.

00:44:21.659 --> 00:44:25.389
Astringent eye drops were
resorted to.

00:44:25.389 --> 00:44:30.400
A particularly perverse theory,
with no empirical basis,

00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:34.869
was the idea that scarring on
the face could be reduced or

00:44:34.869 --> 00:44:39.181
prevented by causing more
intense irritation of the skin

00:44:39.181 --> 00:44:42.416
elsewhere;
so that mustard plasters,

00:44:42.416 --> 00:44:46.431
mercury and corrosives were
applied on the back,

00:44:46.431 --> 00:44:48.909
in order to save the face.
 

00:44:48.909 --> 00:44:52.791
There were also all kinds of
local applications to the face,

00:44:52.791 --> 00:44:54.699
to try to prevent scarring.
 

00:44:54.699 --> 00:44:58.003
Nitrate of silver,
mercury, iodine,

00:44:58.003 --> 00:45:03.750
mild acids, a lotion of sulfur;
all of those had their vogues.

00:45:03.750 --> 00:45:07.684
There were ointments and
compresses of virtually every

00:45:07.684 --> 00:45:09.539
substance known to man.
 

00:45:09.539 --> 00:45:13.445
Some physicians held the theory
that their preparations would

00:45:13.445 --> 00:45:16.179
soften the lesion and mitigate
scarring.

00:45:16.179 --> 00:45:19.557
So, indeed, ingenious doctors
applied lint,

00:45:19.557 --> 00:45:23.820
boric acid or glycerin;
or they covered the face with a

00:45:23.820 --> 00:45:27.449
mask, leaving holes for the
eyes, nose and mouth.

00:45:27.449 --> 00:45:31.710
Or they wrapped the face and
hands in oiled silk.

00:45:31.710 --> 00:45:35.956
Alcoholic beverages were
administered to deteriorating

00:45:35.956 --> 00:45:38.679
patients to revive their energy.
 

00:45:38.679 --> 00:45:43.610
And sometimes delirious
patients were actually tied to

00:45:43.610 --> 00:45:44.820
their beds.
 

00:45:44.820 --> 00:45:49.226
Some doctors recommended
restraints, such as splints,

00:45:49.226 --> 00:45:52.614
in later stages,
to prevent patients from

00:45:52.614 --> 00:45:55.920
scarring their faces by
scratching.

00:45:55.920 --> 00:45:59.130
After hearing of all of these
treatments for smallpox,

00:45:59.130 --> 00:46:02.530
perhaps you'll appreciate the
work of Thomas Sydenham,

00:46:02.530 --> 00:46:07.512
in the seventeenth century,
the so-called English

00:46:07.512 --> 00:46:11.340
Hippocrates,
who decided that the wealthy

00:46:11.340 --> 00:46:16.126
and noble who received extensive
attention and treatment for

00:46:16.126 --> 00:46:21.559
smallpox perished of the disease
more frequently than the poor,

00:46:21.559 --> 00:46:24.250
who had no access to treatment.
 

00:46:24.250 --> 00:46:28.396
And his advice was that the
best physician was the one who

00:46:28.396 --> 00:46:29.559
did the least.
 

00:46:29.559 --> 00:46:33.210
He was an advocate of
therapeutic minimalism.

00:46:33.210 --> 00:46:37.193
He advised instead a simple
cool regimen,

00:46:37.193 --> 00:46:42.768
giving his patients fresh air
and light bed coverings.

00:46:42.768 --> 00:46:47.460
Well, that's how the disease
afflicted the human body.

00:46:47.460 --> 00:46:51.224
What I want to do next time,
now that we understand this

00:46:51.224 --> 00:46:54.510
terrible disease and the
suffering it caused,

00:46:54.510 --> 00:46:57.699
is to deal with its impact
historically,

00:46:57.699 --> 00:47:01.608
its effect on society,
and to look at the development

00:47:01.608 --> 00:47:06.599
of a public health strategy,
which was to be vaccination.

00:47:06.599 --> 00:47:12.000

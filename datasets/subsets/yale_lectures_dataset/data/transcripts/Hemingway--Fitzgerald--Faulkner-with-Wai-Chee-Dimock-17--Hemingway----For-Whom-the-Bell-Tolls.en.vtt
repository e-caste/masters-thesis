WAI CHEE DIMOCK: So we're just
going to move on

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.400
now and follow up on what we

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:11.200
talked about last time, which is
the sevenfold permutation.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.167
It sounds kind of
intimidating.

00:00:13.167 --> 00:00:15.567
But it's actually what we'll be
talking about in the four

00:00:15.567 --> 00:00:19.267
classes devoted to For
Whom the Bell Tolls.

00:00:19.267 --> 00:00:23.733
And last time we talked a lot
about voluntary versus

00:00:23.733 --> 00:00:27.533
involuntary association,
including the idea of the

00:00:27.533 --> 00:00:32.167
involuntary foreigners, that
both Americans and the Spanish

00:00:32.167 --> 00:00:35.600
actually can be involuntary
foreigners.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.167
The Americans in the simple
fact that they don't have

00:00:39.167 --> 00:00:41.800
perfect command of the language,
and also that they

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.567
are recognizable as foreigners,
as outsiders in

00:00:44.567 --> 00:00:45.967
their community.

00:00:45.967 --> 00:00:48.567
But the Spanish can also be
outsiders in their own

00:00:48.567 --> 00:00:52.000
community because of two things,
Because of the print

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.833
illiteracy, and because of the
technological illiteracy.

00:00:56.833 --> 00:01:00.600
So in those two ways they are
both stuck with a kind of

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.800
involuntary association.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:10.400
Today we'll move on to the
next way to configure the

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.867
contents of For Whom
the Bell Tolls.

00:01:12.867 --> 00:01:16.900
And I'D like to think of it as
a very sustained structure.

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:24.500
Hemingway is a writer who
actually not only starts out

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.700
with a pattern, but keeps
elaborating on that pattern.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.800
So in many ways, it really is a
kind of a musical structure,

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.867
theme and variation.

00:01:32.867 --> 00:01:36.033
And the paradigm of distant
home versus on-site

00:01:36.033 --> 00:01:39.500
environment, that actually is
a theme and variation almost

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.400
throughout the entire For
Whom the Bell Tolls.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:48.633
And plugged into that is a kind
of play between the comic

00:01:48.633 --> 00:01:49.833
and the tragic.

00:01:49.833 --> 00:01:52.867
But really the main, the
dominant theme today, would be

00:01:52.867 --> 00:01:57.533
the relation between distant
homes and on-site environment.

00:01:57.533 --> 00:02:01.033
So I've seven candidates
for distant homes.

00:02:01.033 --> 00:02:05.933
One is in Paris, which is very
odd, because already we're in

00:02:05.933 --> 00:02:09.633
a foreign countries, to American
readers, Spain.

00:02:09.633 --> 00:02:13.600
But there's yet another foreign
country, France and

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.600
especially Paris, which makes
a cameo appearance.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.933
And then there are five
locations, both spatial

00:02:19.933 --> 00:02:23.200
locations and temporal locations
in the United States

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.100
that are the distant homes
for Robert Jordan.

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.867
So we'll talk about why each of
them is involved, and the

00:02:29.867 --> 00:02:32.867
relation between that
distant home and the

00:02:32.867 --> 00:02:34.700
immediate Spanish setting.

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.067
But first of all, Paris.

00:02:37.067 --> 00:02:41.333
Paris comes up in the context
of Robert drinking the

00:02:41.333 --> 00:02:44.200
absinthe that he carries
with him.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.467
And right before that, he has
actually asked for wine and

00:02:47.467 --> 00:02:48.867
there's not a lot
of wine left.

00:02:48.867 --> 00:02:51.167
So Maria want to give him wine,
but Pablo says there's

00:02:51.167 --> 00:02:52.333
not much left.

00:02:52.333 --> 00:02:58.900
So he doesn't get to have the
wine from the locals.

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.800
And instead he pulls out this
bottle of absinthe.

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.433
And nobody there has seen this,
so he tells us them that

00:03:07.433 --> 00:03:09.200
this is medicine.

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.833
And the gypsy wants
to taste what this

00:03:10.833 --> 00:03:13.400
medicine tastes like.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.500
"Robert Jordan pushed
the cup toward him.

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.533
It was a milky yellow now with
the water and he hoped the

00:03:20.533 --> 00:03:23.900
gypsy would not take more
than a swallow.

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.200
There was very little of it left
and one cup of it took

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.433
the place of the evening
papers, of all the old

00:03:31.433 --> 00:03:35.667
evenings in cafes, of all the
chestnut trees that would be

00:03:35.667 --> 00:03:40.100
in bloom now in this month, of
the great slow horses of the

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:44.733
outer boulevards, of bookshops,
of kiosks, and of

00:03:44.733 --> 00:03:48.633
galleries, of the Parc
Montsouris, of the Stade

00:03:48.633 --> 00:03:52.500
Buffalo, of the Butte Chaumont,
of the Guarantee

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.400
Trust Company and the Il de la
Cite, of Foyot's old hotel,

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.367
and of being able to read and
relax in the evening; of all

00:04:01.367 --> 00:04:04.933
the things he had enjoyed and
forgotten and that came back

00:04:04.933 --> 00:04:08.967
to him when he tasted
that opaque, bitter,

00:04:08.967 --> 00:04:14.900
tongue-numbing, brain-warming,
stomach-warming, idea changing

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:16.533
liquid alchemy."

00:04:16.533 --> 00:04:24.800
This is as beautiful a praise
song to Paris as I've seen.

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.967
But what is odd about this
praise song of Paris is that

00:04:29.967 --> 00:04:35.700
it actually is not pointing to
all the monumental tourist

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:39.533
attractions of Paris, no Eiffel
Tower in there, no Arc

00:04:39.533 --> 00:04:40.433
de Triomphe.

00:04:40.433 --> 00:04:43.300
Instead it is the
chestnut trees--

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.133
actually they're horse chestnuts
in this picture.

00:04:47.133 --> 00:04:52.467
But chestnut trees, all over
Paris, very common sight.

00:04:52.467 --> 00:04:55.833
Kiosks, very, very
common site.

00:04:55.833 --> 00:05:01.333
Parc Montsouris is actually kind
of out of the way, and

00:05:01.333 --> 00:05:02.633
it's not very spectacular.

00:05:02.633 --> 00:05:04.567
it's just a park.

00:05:04.567 --> 00:05:07.700
And then this Stade Buffalo,
actually I've never--

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:10.733
I have to look it up, it might
not even be there.

00:05:10.733 --> 00:05:13.300
It's a cycling track.

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:17.800
And then the Parc des Buttes
Chaumont, it's also not--

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.033
I mean it's a nice park, but I
don't think it's that famous.

00:05:21.033 --> 00:05:23.733
It's more of a kind of
a neighborhood park.

00:05:23.733 --> 00:05:24.533
It's on a hill.

00:05:24.533 --> 00:05:26.900
So there's kind of this
hilly structure.

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:30.100
This is the butte that gives
the park the name.

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:33.000
And the Ile de la Cite
is the island in the

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.800
middle of the Seine.

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:35.933
It's a very beautiful place.

00:05:35.933 --> 00:05:38.400
But once again, it is a
neighborhood, rather than a

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.733
kind of major tourist
attraction.

00:05:40.733 --> 00:05:45.500
Although the Notre Dame
cathedral is there.

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:51.133
And finally, the Hotel Foyot,
once again, it's a legend.

00:05:51.133 --> 00:05:55.400
But it's also a place that you
would just walk by every day

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.167
without noticing it.

00:05:57.167 --> 00:06:00.133
And that's really the
main point, is that

00:06:00.133 --> 00:06:02.633
all those names --

00:06:02.633 --> 00:06:06.233
I don't even think it is
Hemingway name-dropping

00:06:06.233 --> 00:06:08.333
because those names
actually are not

00:06:08.333 --> 00:06:10.467
recognizable to most of us.

00:06:10.467 --> 00:06:14.400
Those are just the neighborhood
features, the

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:19.033
local features, of various
Paris neighborhoods.

00:06:19.033 --> 00:06:23.900
And those are the things that
people would walk by every day

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:25.867
and just take them
for granted.

00:06:25.867 --> 00:06:31.033
And that is really what Paris
means for Hemingway.

00:06:31.033 --> 00:06:32.567
He did spend--

00:06:32.567 --> 00:06:34.967
well, for Hemingway and also
for Robert Jordan--

00:06:34.967 --> 00:06:38.667
Hemingway did spend several
years in Paris.

00:06:38.667 --> 00:06:42.367
He wrote about it in
A Moveable Feast.

00:06:42.367 --> 00:06:44.767
And he wrote very
well in Paris.

00:06:44.767 --> 00:06:48.400
He said that he could actually
write about Michigan best when

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:49.700
he was in Paris.

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:54.733
He said that in A Moveable
Feast. So it was Hemingway's

00:06:54.733 --> 00:06:58.767
home in a sense that it's
a place where a

00:06:58.767 --> 00:06:59.933
writer could write.

00:06:59.933 --> 00:07:01.533
And I think that there
really is no better

00:07:01.533 --> 00:07:03.567
definition of home.

00:07:03.567 --> 00:07:06.933
Home is a place where
you can work without

00:07:06.933 --> 00:07:10.233
self-consciousness, where
you have a work routine.

00:07:10.233 --> 00:07:13.367
And you can count on being
able to produce

00:07:13.367 --> 00:07:14.567
something every day.

00:07:14.567 --> 00:07:18.433
For me, that's also actually
my own definition of home.

00:07:18.433 --> 00:07:23.667
So it's kind of a minor
variation on Hemingway's kind

00:07:23.667 --> 00:07:25.567
of total obsession
with writing.

00:07:28.233 --> 00:07:29.867
You don't have to
think about it.

00:07:29.867 --> 00:07:32.033
It's just there every day,
and you can just do the

00:07:32.033 --> 00:07:34.667
same thing every day.

00:07:34.667 --> 00:07:41.333
So that is the security and
the everyday-ness of Paris

00:07:41.333 --> 00:07:47.700
that is contrasted with the
on-site environment, which is

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:49.933
very violent and unpredictable
where he's

00:07:49.933 --> 00:07:51.400
so obviously a foreigner.

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:54.367
Even though Hemingway was a
foreigner in Paris, the fact

00:07:54.367 --> 00:07:57.033
that he was able to write
so well in Paris

00:07:57.033 --> 00:07:59.300
meant that that actually--

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:04.067
the foreignness was sort of
bracketed by his very

00:08:04.067 --> 00:08:07.433
productive relation
to his own craft.

00:08:07.433 --> 00:08:11.267
Here in Spain, it's a totally
different relation.

00:08:11.267 --> 00:08:17.267
So we'll look at what comes
after that invocation in his

00:08:17.267 --> 00:08:21.367
own mind of Paris that is
brought on by the absinthe.

00:08:21.367 --> 00:08:26.467
"The gypsy made a face and
handed the cup back.

00:08:26.467 --> 00:08:30.267
'It smells of anis but it is
bitter as gall,' he said.

00:08:30.267 --> 00:08:35.333
'It is better to be sick than
have that medicine.' 'That's

00:08:35.333 --> 00:08:38.667
the wormwood,' Robert Jordan
told them. 'In this, the real

00:08:38.667 --> 00:08:41.067
absinthe, there is wormwood.

00:08:41.067 --> 00:08:43.133
It's supposed to rot your
brain out but I

00:08:43.133 --> 00:08:44.300
don't believe it.

00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:46.767
It only changes the ideas.

00:08:46.767 --> 00:08:50.033
You should pour water into
it very slowly, a few

00:08:50.033 --> 00:08:51.167
drops at the time.

00:08:51.167 --> 00:08:55.400
But I poured it into the water.'
'What are you saying?'

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:58.767
Pablo said angrily, feeling
the mockery.

00:08:58.767 --> 00:09:01.200
'Explaining the medicine,'
Robert Jordan

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:02.733
told him and grinned.

00:09:02.733 --> 00:09:05.200
'I bought it in Madrid.

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:09.767
It was the last bottle and it's
lasted me three weeks.'

00:09:09.767 --> 00:09:13.467
He took a big swallow of it and
felt it coasting over his

00:09:13.467 --> 00:09:16.200
tongue in delicate anesthesia.

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:19.567
He looked at Pablo and
grinned again."

00:09:19.567 --> 00:09:23.433
So we've seen how aggressive
the locals can be when it

00:09:23.433 --> 00:09:25.767
comes to hopping on Kashkin.

00:09:25.767 --> 00:09:32.933
And there's a foreigner just
like Robert, rare name, dead,

00:09:32.933 --> 00:09:34.667
who works the explosives.

00:09:34.667 --> 00:09:39.967
The questions from the locals is
very well matched by what I

00:09:39.967 --> 00:09:43.367
would say is sort of the
good-natured aggression, but

00:09:43.367 --> 00:09:48.433
nonetheless aggression on
the part of Robert.

00:09:48.433 --> 00:09:50.400
These people know nothing
about Paris.

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:53.367
They've never been
outside of Spain.

00:09:53.367 --> 00:09:57.000
They've never been outside
of the local community.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.467
So it seems that some of them,
many of them, have never been

00:10:01.467 --> 00:10:05.467
to Madrid even because these
are the local guerrillas.

00:10:05.467 --> 00:10:07.500
They are very much--

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:11.400
they stay put in their
own small community.

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:16.033
So even Madrid is in many ways
a foreign country to them.

00:10:16.033 --> 00:10:19.233
And Robert Jordan, the American,
knows Paris, he

00:10:19.233 --> 00:10:23.633
knows the capital of Spain, he
knows this liquor that they've

00:10:23.633 --> 00:10:25.200
never tasted.

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:29.267
And he's fooling them into
thinking that it's medicine.

00:10:29.267 --> 00:10:35.267
And he's drunk the last bottle
of absinthe in Madrid.

00:10:35.267 --> 00:10:40.567
So a lot of this, just like the
print illiteracy that he

00:10:40.567 --> 00:10:45.067
comes upon, that he just
discovers without meaning to,

00:10:45.067 --> 00:10:49.833
this is his actively
highlighting the fact that he

00:10:49.833 --> 00:10:54.033
is much more a man of the
world than they are, and

00:10:54.033 --> 00:10:54.800
there's no competition.

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:59.733
This is a very well traveled man
just by the nature of what

00:10:59.733 --> 00:11:02.433
he's doing, he's
well traveled.

00:11:02.433 --> 00:11:05.467
And these people are completely
rooted in their own

00:11:05.467 --> 00:11:06.000
environment.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.267
Although I should say that it
is an entirely open question

00:11:10.267 --> 00:11:14.200
by the end of the novel, which
is the better fate?

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:17.600
Whether it's the well traveled
person who has a better

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:20.400
future, or whether it's actually
people who are rooted

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:21.867
in their environments who
have a better future.

00:11:21.867 --> 00:11:24.433
I think it's very much
an open question by

00:11:24.433 --> 00:11:26.000
the end of the novel.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.467
At this moment though, this is
the moment when Robert has his

00:11:29.467 --> 00:11:32.133
little victory over
the locals.

00:11:32.133 --> 00:11:35.000
He's just able to show them
all the things --

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.900
highlight, dramatize to them
-- all the things that he

00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:40.500
knows that they don't know.

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:46.867
So the first invocation of a
distant home has the effect

00:11:46.867 --> 00:11:51.467
actually of bringing out an
edge to say the least. And

00:11:51.467 --> 00:11:54.967
Pablo certainly recognizes
that --

00:11:54.967 --> 00:11:59.667
an edge, a tension between
Robert and the locals who are

00:11:59.667 --> 00:12:01.200
otherwise his comrades.

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:04.000
They're on the same
side of the war.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.733
It has a funny effect
on both sides.

00:12:06.733 --> 00:12:08.800
It does something to Robert.

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:11.600
It does something
to the locals.

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:16.400
And that's not even America,
Paris really doesn't have any

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:20.933
kind of special connotation I
don't think to the locals in

00:12:20.933 --> 00:12:25.067
the sense that Robert
is not really never

00:12:25.067 --> 00:12:27.667
considered a Frenchman.

00:12:27.667 --> 00:12:30.100
But when it comes to invocation
of the United

00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:31.733
States, it's a different
story.

00:12:31.733 --> 00:12:34.067
They all know that that's
something that he has a

00:12:34.067 --> 00:12:36.067
relation to.

00:12:36.067 --> 00:12:41.867
And in the progression, we're
starting out with the most

00:12:41.867 --> 00:12:47.967
benign, at least not completely
not innocuous

00:12:47.967 --> 00:12:49.433
invocation of the
United States.

00:12:49.433 --> 00:12:53.600
And this is Missoula, Montana,
where Robert Jordan is from,

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:57.633
and where he's thinking that he
will go back to after war

00:12:57.633 --> 00:13:01.467
and that maybe he'll take
Maria with him.

00:13:01.467 --> 00:13:03.900
And this is actually a good
moment to think about exactly

00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:06.267
the nature of that
romance between

00:13:06.267 --> 00:13:08.133
Robert Jordan and Maria.

00:13:08.133 --> 00:13:09.200
"Why not marry her?

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:10.300
Sure, he thought.

00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:11.567
I will marry her.

00:13:11.567 --> 00:13:13.600
Then we'll be Mr. and
Mrs. Robert Jordan

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:15.567
of Sun Valley, Idaho.

00:13:15.567 --> 00:13:19.533
Or Corpus Christi, Texas,
or Butte, Montana.

00:13:19.533 --> 00:13:21.400
Spanish girls make
wonderful wives.

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:24.100
I've never had one so I know.

00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:27.467
And when I get my job back at
the university she can be an

00:13:27.467 --> 00:13:30.733
instructor's wife and when
undergraduates who take

00:13:30.733 --> 00:13:34.233
Spanish IV come in to smoke
pipes in the evening and have

00:13:34.233 --> 00:13:38.467
those so valuable informal
discussions about Quevedo,

00:13:38.467 --> 00:13:43.433
Lope de Vega, Galdos and the
other always admirable dead,

00:13:43.433 --> 00:13:46.967
Maria can tell them about how
some of the blue-shirted

00:13:46.967 --> 00:13:51.667
crusaders for the true faith sat
on her head while others

00:13:51.667 --> 00:13:56.633
twisted her arms and pulled her
skirts up and stuffed them

00:13:56.633 --> 00:14:00.100
in her mouth."

00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:04.267
I began by saying that this is
relatively benign, but in fact

00:14:04.267 --> 00:14:07.700
there's no such thing as the
benign invocation of the

00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:10.667
distant home in Hemingway.

00:14:10.667 --> 00:14:14.567
Even from beginning to end,
there's something very funny

00:14:14.567 --> 00:14:17.733
about the tone of
that invocation.

00:14:17.733 --> 00:14:22.100
The first part of it is--

00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:25.533
the first little bit of it about
going back to all the

00:14:25.533 --> 00:14:29.867
cities that were kind of the
heartland of America, and then

00:14:29.867 --> 00:14:32.200
the particular job
that he had.

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:38.700
He was a professor at the
university teaching Spanish.

00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:41.467
And kind of the joke about
people coming in, informal

00:14:41.467 --> 00:14:45.333
discussions, I would say that
actually is kind of a benign

00:14:45.333 --> 00:14:49.333
irony in the sense that we all
tend to be ironic about things

00:14:49.333 --> 00:14:50.933
actually that we are
quite attached to.

00:14:50.933 --> 00:14:52.533
I noticed yesterday.

00:14:52.533 --> 00:14:55.533
I was talking about a writer
that I love who

00:14:55.533 --> 00:14:56.433
writes about food.

00:14:56.433 --> 00:14:58.833
And I said, she's cornered--
she has two books out on

00:14:58.833 --> 00:15:00.467
food-- and I said she's
cornered the

00:15:00.467 --> 00:15:02.233
market on food writing.

00:15:02.233 --> 00:15:03.100
And the person who
I was talking to

00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:04.700
really looked at me.

00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:07.267
But I actually love
this author.

00:15:07.267 --> 00:15:13.233
But that's just my way of not
being too attached, showing

00:15:13.233 --> 00:15:15.367
some critical distance.

00:15:15.367 --> 00:15:21.100
So the first part of that is
just the kinds of the typical

00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:25.333
professional irony towards
something that you really

00:15:25.333 --> 00:15:31.567
actually do want to go back to
and have some yearning for.

00:15:31.567 --> 00:15:42.467
But in the midst of that, Robert
just can't stop himself

00:15:42.467 --> 00:15:48.433
from importing something else
to that otherwise benign

00:15:48.433 --> 00:15:48.933
environment.

00:15:48.933 --> 00:15:51.700
And so we sort of know
ahead of time that

00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:53.333
Maria was once raped.

00:15:53.333 --> 00:15:56.833
We have no idea when
that happened.

00:15:59.333 --> 00:16:04.667
This is Hemingway's way of
telling the story, giving bits

00:16:04.667 --> 00:16:09.000
and pieces of the story
one at a time.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:15.167
So this particular importation
of something that happens in

00:16:15.167 --> 00:16:20.333
Spain into an otherwise innocent
American environment

00:16:20.333 --> 00:16:24.733
has the weight not only of
darkening the textures of that

00:16:24.733 --> 00:16:30.300
otherwise innocent college
town, but also completely

00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:34.467
changes his relation to
the local setting.

00:16:34.467 --> 00:16:37.067
It's not even just a place
where he's having

00:16:37.067 --> 00:16:38.033
trouble with Pablo.

00:16:38.033 --> 00:16:41.133
That's the least
of the problem.

00:16:41.133 --> 00:16:45.000
They're much more deeply
rooted problems.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.900
So this is another spin
on the idea of being

00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:51.133
rooted in your community.

00:16:51.133 --> 00:16:55.200
Usually when we think of being
rooted in our community, we

00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:57.933
just think of having stayed
there for a long time, maybe

00:16:57.933 --> 00:17:02.233
having been there for
generations or at least within

00:17:02.233 --> 00:17:04.633
the life of a person,
many, many years.

00:17:04.633 --> 00:17:06.467
And usually it's a good thing.

00:17:06.467 --> 00:17:09.267
But there's another way in which
being rooted in your

00:17:09.267 --> 00:17:13.967
environment means that all the
dark episodes from the past

00:17:13.967 --> 00:17:18.733
are visited upon you, or all the
feuds, or the old angers,

00:17:18.733 --> 00:17:23.767
old hatreds, are constantly
being reactivated.

00:17:23.767 --> 00:17:27.733
Sometimes just in memory, and
sometimes reenacted in the

00:17:27.733 --> 00:17:30.567
bodies of people who are
otherwise young.

00:17:30.567 --> 00:17:32.600
Maria is a very young girl.

00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:37.000
But what is being visited upon
her is not personal.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.833
It really has nothing
to do with her.

00:17:40.833 --> 00:17:43.533
They don't mean to rape Maria.

00:17:43.533 --> 00:17:47.033
They make raping her as a symbol
of something else.

00:17:47.033 --> 00:17:52.067
So this is the other-- this is
the hazard of spending all

00:17:52.067 --> 00:17:55.467
your life and being rooted in
one particular community.

00:17:55.467 --> 00:18:02.933
It's that ancient angers can be
inherited by people who are

00:18:02.933 --> 00:18:04.400
relatively young.

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:09.967
So I would say this is the basic
dynamics of the relation

00:18:09.967 --> 00:18:12.433
between the United
States and Spain.

00:18:12.433 --> 00:18:16.267
It's that there's a kind of a
spill over in both directions,

00:18:16.267 --> 00:18:19.200
something very violent spilling
over into the

00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:20.833
American context.

00:18:20.833 --> 00:18:24.433
And then we'll see another way
in which the violence of the

00:18:24.433 --> 00:18:29.433
American context will spill over
into the Spanish setting.

00:18:29.433 --> 00:18:35.367
And this is still a relatively
benign instance.

00:18:35.367 --> 00:18:40.467
But again something just
not quite right.

00:18:40.467 --> 00:18:40.967
"Yes"--

00:18:40.967 --> 00:18:42.567
and talking about gypsies.

00:18:42.567 --> 00:18:49.867
And I should say that Hemingway
actually is

00:18:49.867 --> 00:18:54.500
surprisingly far-sighted about
the problem of the gypsies.

00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:57.633
They're now called Roma, and
it's a huge problem in the

00:18:57.633 --> 00:19:01.600
sense that the European Union
is recognizing the fact that

00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:05.100
the Romas actually have always
been oppressed by various

00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:06.167
national governments.

00:19:06.167 --> 00:19:09.367
So it's quite a big
issue in Europe.

00:19:09.367 --> 00:19:12.967
And Hemingway back when he was
writing about Spanish Civil

00:19:12.967 --> 00:19:16.567
War already seemed to
have caught on.

00:19:16.567 --> 00:19:17.800
"'Yes,' Anselmo said.

00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:22.300
'The gypsies believe the bear
to be a brother of man.' 'So

00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:26.700
also believe the Indians in
America,' Robert Jordan said.

00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:30.933
'And when they kill a bear, they
apologize to him and ask

00:19:30.933 --> 00:19:34.300
his pardon...' 'Do you have
any gypsy blood?' 'No.

00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:37.367
But I have seen much of them
and clearly, since the

00:19:37.367 --> 00:19:38.933
movement, more.

00:19:38.933 --> 00:19:41.067
There are many in the hills.

00:19:41.067 --> 00:19:46.033
To them it is not a sin to
kill outside the tribe.

00:19:46.033 --> 00:19:51.167
They deny this but it is true.'
'Like the Moors.'"

00:19:51.167 --> 00:19:54.800
So it is not a sin to kill
outside a tribe.

00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:58.700
Usually, I mean for most of us,
the injunction is against

00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:00.167
killing, period.

00:20:00.167 --> 00:20:03.767
So there's just no qualifying
after that.

00:20:03.767 --> 00:20:09.400
But according to Anselmo, it
is completely OK for the

00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:12.867
gypsies to kill anyone outside
of the immediate tribe.

00:20:12.867 --> 00:20:16.433
So it's a straight
ethnic divide.

00:20:16.433 --> 00:20:19.633
Within your own tribe, you
don't kill anyone, or you

00:20:19.633 --> 00:20:22.167
don't kill anyone unless
you're under serious

00:20:22.167 --> 00:20:23.267
provocation.

00:20:23.267 --> 00:20:25.833
Outside of your tribe, you're
free to kill anyone.

00:20:25.833 --> 00:20:32.333
So that's a incredible charge to
level against the gypsies.

00:20:32.333 --> 00:20:36.300
But what is weird is that
Robert then comes

00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:38.500
up with this analogy.

00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:41.833
It's that the gypsies are
just like the Moors.

00:20:41.833 --> 00:20:44.800
So this might not make any
sense to us right now.

00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:48.367
But it turns out that this is
actually one of the aspects of

00:20:48.367 --> 00:20:52.433
the deep cultural
roots in Spain.

00:20:52.433 --> 00:20:57.000
This is a beautiful instance
of the Moorish

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.667
architecture in Spain.

00:20:58.667 --> 00:21:03.800
You guys know that the Moors
from Africa, from North

00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:09.567
Africa, actually were the rulers
in Spain for 800 years.

00:21:09.567 --> 00:21:14.533
It was in 1492, the same year
that Columbus discovered the

00:21:14.533 --> 00:21:17.800
New World, it was the same
year that the Moors were

00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:20.200
expelled from Spain
along with Jews.

00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:24.333
The Moors and the Jews were
the two persecuted ethnic

00:21:24.333 --> 00:21:26.400
groups in Spain.

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:34.300
And so when Isabella of Castile
expelled the Moors

00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:42.700
from Grenada, there was this
policy throughout Spain to try

00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:47.500
to erase Islamic
book learning.

00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:51.700
Cordoba was a huge center
of learning

00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:53.700
throughout the Middle Ages.

00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:57.100
And people from all over Europe
would go to Cordoba to

00:21:57.100 --> 00:22:01.000
study, Arabic science was
very, very advanced.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.400
Arabic Moorish architecture
was beautiful.

00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:07.500
Cordoba had bath houses, more
public baths than any other

00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:08.567
city in Europe.

00:22:08.567 --> 00:22:10.933
It was basically a beacon
of enlightenment in

00:22:10.933 --> 00:22:13.600
Spain, in all of Europe.

00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:20.033
And when they were destroyed by
the Catholic forces, by the

00:22:20.033 --> 00:22:25.967
Catholic monarchs, there was
much of an attempt to try to

00:22:25.967 --> 00:22:27.267
erase all of that.

00:22:27.267 --> 00:22:28.200
It wasn't successful.

00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:32.000
So we still today, if we were to
go to Cordoba or Toledo, we

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.600
would still see lots of
Moorish architecture.

00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:40.200
So there's one kind of sore
point in Spanish history.

00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:43.067
It's that they really have done
this to a very glorious

00:22:43.067 --> 00:22:44.900
civilization.

00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:48.200
But there's another sore point
that is more immediate to the

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:49.567
Spanish Civil War.

00:22:49.567 --> 00:22:53.367
And this is reported by the
American poet Langston Hughes

00:22:53.367 --> 00:22:56.800
who was there along
with Hemingway.

00:22:56.800 --> 00:23:00.933
And Langston Hughes was really
struck by the presence of the

00:23:00.933 --> 00:23:03.800
Moors in the Spanish
Civil War.

00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:08.067
So he wrote several pieces
about the Moors, after

00:23:08.067 --> 00:23:12.433
sometimes seeing them in the
hospitals and actually having

00:23:12.433 --> 00:23:16.667
this very uneasy kinship between
himself and the Moors.

00:23:16.667 --> 00:23:20.900
So this is from his essay
General Franco's Moors.

00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:24.133
"The Moorish troops were
colonial conscripts, or men

00:23:24.133 --> 00:23:28.167
from the Moroccan villages
enticed into the army by

00:23:28.167 --> 00:23:31.300
offers of what seemed to
them very good pay.

00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:35.400
Franco's personal body guard
consisted of Moorish soldiers,

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:37.533
tall picturesque fellows
in flowing

00:23:37.533 --> 00:23:40.100
robes and winding turbans.

00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:42.633
Before I left home, American
papers that carried

00:23:42.633 --> 00:23:47.067
photographs of turbaned,
Mohammadan troops marching in

00:23:47.067 --> 00:23:50.267
the streets of Burgos,
Seville, and Malaga.

00:23:50.267 --> 00:23:53.533
And the United Press dispatch
from Gibraltar that summer

00:23:53.533 --> 00:23:58.533
said "Arabs had been crossing
the Straits of Gibraltar from

00:23:58.533 --> 00:24:04.133
Spanish Morocco to Algeciras and
Malaga at the rate of 300

00:24:04.133 --> 00:24:06.533
to 400 a day...

00:24:06.533 --> 00:24:12.600
General Franco intends to mass
50,000 new Arab troops in

00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:13.200
Spain."

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:17.100
So given the past history,
given the uneasy relation

00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:23.433
between the Spanish and Moorish
population of North

00:24:23.433 --> 00:24:28.267
Africa, for General Franco
actually to use the Moorish

00:24:28.267 --> 00:24:35.367
troops as very active combat
units against the Spanish

00:24:35.367 --> 00:24:39.600
Republican side, that is about
the worst he could have done.

00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:40.867
It was successful actually.

00:24:40.867 --> 00:24:42.767
He won the war.

00:24:42.767 --> 00:24:47.000
But it was about the worst in
terms of being tone-deaf.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.833
He was probably about as
tone-deaf as anyone could be

00:24:49.833 --> 00:24:51.900
who won at the end.

00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:54.000
But that's what happened.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:59.933
And so there were indeed lots
and lots of pictures of the

00:24:59.933 --> 00:25:04.300
Moors crossing over from Africa
just paid to fight the

00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:05.600
Spanish Republic.

00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:12.467
Here are his Moorish body
guards, and they're engaged in

00:25:12.467 --> 00:25:15.167
more active combat.

00:25:15.167 --> 00:25:20.267
So to bring up the Moors, I
don't even know what motivates

00:25:20.267 --> 00:25:24.900
Robert to make that analogy
between the

00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:26.200
gypsies and the Moors.

00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:32.333
It couldn't really be just
blindness or just callousness.

00:25:32.333 --> 00:25:35.767
I think there's some
intentionality in there.

00:25:35.767 --> 00:25:38.767
But it's sort of hard to know
why he would want to bring up

00:25:38.767 --> 00:25:43.700
this very, very sensitive
issue for the Spanish.

00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:49.800
So I think that all we can say
is that it seems that it's

00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:55.467
very easy for an involuntary
foreigner to say something

00:25:55.467 --> 00:26:00.433
that is wounding to the
locals, maybe without

00:26:00.433 --> 00:26:05.833
intending it to have the extent
of the insult, the

00:26:05.833 --> 00:26:10.733
extent of the injury that is
actually the actual outcome of

00:26:10.733 --> 00:26:12.100
saying something like that.

00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:15.767
Robert probably had no idea
that mentioning the Moors

00:26:15.767 --> 00:26:21.567
would create those kinds of
connotations, those kind of

00:26:21.567 --> 00:26:24.467
just edginess on the part of
the Spanish here is, but

00:26:24.467 --> 00:26:26.600
that's what he's doing.

00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:29.467
So once again, the kind of a
spilling over, thinking about

00:26:29.467 --> 00:26:33.167
Native Americans with their own
very uneasy history in the

00:26:33.167 --> 00:26:33.800
United States.

00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:35.967
Think about Native Americans,
thinking about gypsies in

00:26:35.967 --> 00:26:38.367
Europe, and thinking
about the Moors.

00:26:38.367 --> 00:26:43.967
Three ethnic groups all with
uneasy histories behind them.

00:26:43.967 --> 00:26:47.800
And it is the invocation of all
three of them in the same

00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:52.433
breath that makes that
particular exchange especially

00:26:52.433 --> 00:26:56.067
uncomfortable, if not
downright hurtful.

00:26:56.067 --> 00:27:01.767
But let's just look at a more
serious instance of this kind

00:27:01.767 --> 00:27:06.600
of distant home being a kind of
irritation to the immediate

00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:07.633
environment.

00:27:07.633 --> 00:27:10.167
So all of a sudden out of
nowhere, Robert Jordan

00:27:10.167 --> 00:27:15.367
suddenly starts talking about
lynching in Ohio.

00:27:15.367 --> 00:27:18.167
This is completely
uncalled for.

00:27:18.167 --> 00:27:24.333
This is in the context of
talking about the execution of

00:27:24.333 --> 00:27:25.667
the fascists.

00:27:25.667 --> 00:27:31.233
And out of the blue, Robert just
mentions this lynching

00:27:31.233 --> 00:27:36.100
that he was a witness to,
and about the effect of

00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:38.600
drunkenness on people
in general.

00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:40.667
"'It is so,' Robert
Jordan said.

00:27:40.667 --> 00:27:44.500
'When I was seven years old and
going with my mother to

00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:48.033
attend a wedding in the state
of Ohio at which I was to be

00:27:48.033 --> 00:27:52.667
the boy of a pair of boy and
girl who carry flowers.' 'Did

00:27:52.667 --> 00:27:53.900
you do that?' Said Maria.

00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:57.667
'How nice.' 'In this town a
Negro was hanged to a lamp

00:27:57.667 --> 00:28:00.267
post and later burned.

00:28:00.267 --> 00:28:01.767
It was an arc light.

00:28:01.767 --> 00:28:05.900
A light which lowered from
the post to the pavement.

00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:09.600
And he was hoisted, first by the
mechanism which was used

00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:12.767
to hoist the arc light
but this broke.'

00:28:12.767 --> 00:28:18.533
This is a bizarre description of
lynching to say the least.

00:28:18.533 --> 00:28:23.267
It's stuck in the middle of
this long story about

00:28:23.267 --> 00:28:26.200
execution of the fascists.

00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:30.833
And not only that, but it seems
that much of the focus

00:28:30.833 --> 00:28:35.400
is on the mechanism of hoisting
this person up who's

00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:39.567
about to be lynched, and
on how unreliable

00:28:39.567 --> 00:28:43.000
this mechanism is.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.367
It breaks once and then he has
to be done over again.

00:28:46.367 --> 00:28:51.733
So what we can say is that
there's a slightly out of

00:28:51.733 --> 00:28:59.800
focus nature to the invocation
of the United States.

00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:02.500
The proper focus really
ought to be on the

00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:03.667
act of lynching itself.

00:29:03.667 --> 00:29:05.133
Anyone telling the story--

00:29:05.133 --> 00:29:06.833
it would have been on
the act of lynching.

00:29:06.833 --> 00:29:10.867
And instead, it is out of focus
so that it somehow is

00:29:10.867 --> 00:29:15.267
just focused on the mechanism
of hoisting the person up.

00:29:15.267 --> 00:29:19.500
And I think as a kind of
deliberate blurriness that

00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:23.167
suggests that this is really how
the United States looks to

00:29:23.167 --> 00:29:27.033
the Spanish locals, that they
can't get the focus right.

00:29:27.033 --> 00:29:28.700
It's somehow off.

00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:32.667
And that off focus is dramatized
by Maria's response

00:29:32.667 --> 00:29:35.900
which is completely
inappropriate, shows the

00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:38.467
highest degree of ignorance.

00:29:38.467 --> 00:29:39.867
Well, she doesn't know
what's coming.

00:29:39.867 --> 00:29:42.600
But just to say "how nice."
She has no idea.

00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:44.033
She's completely out of it.

00:29:44.033 --> 00:29:45.867
She doesn't get any of it.

00:29:45.867 --> 00:29:51.767
So the reference to the lynching
might seem out of the

00:29:51.767 --> 00:29:55.633
blue to us reading For Whom
the Bell Tolls right now.

00:29:55.633 --> 00:29:59.200
But lynching actually
was a big issue

00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:02.100
all through the 1930s.

00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:06.400
Even though the actual number
of lynching had declined at

00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:07.600
that point.

00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:11.000
It was highlighted, it was
brought to the public

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.867
consciousness for a
number of reasons.

00:30:13.867 --> 00:30:18.567
One is this very famous song
that I think that you guys

00:30:18.567 --> 00:30:23.700
probably have heard, Billie
Holiday's Strange Fruit, 1939.

00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:29.133
It's a great collaboration
between a black singer and

00:30:29.133 --> 00:30:35.600
actually the songwriter was
Jewish, Abel Meeropol.

00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:39.400
So this is one of the first
instances of a black-Jewish

00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:45.167
collaboration resulting in this
classic song in the jazz

00:30:45.167 --> 00:30:45.933
repertoire.

00:30:45.933 --> 00:30:49.200
But these are the lyrics
of Strange Fruit.

00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:55.300
And you can see why that image
would lead to those lyrics.

00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:58.567
"Southern trees bear
a strange fruit.

00:30:58.567 --> 00:31:01.467
Blood on the leaves,
blood at the root.

00:31:01.467 --> 00:31:04.200
Black bodies swinging in
the Southern breeze.

00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:07.533
Strange fruit hanging from
the tops of the trees.

00:31:07.533 --> 00:31:12.700
Pastoral scene of the gallant
South, the bulging eyes and

00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:14.233
the twisted mouth.

00:31:14.233 --> 00:31:17.300
The scent of magnolia,
sweet and fresh.

00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:20.500
Then the sudden smell
of burning flesh.

00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:24.533
Here is a fruit for the crows
to pluck, for the rain to

00:31:24.533 --> 00:31:26.533
gather, for the wind to suck.

00:31:26.533 --> 00:31:30.300
For the sun to rot, for
the trees to drop.

00:31:30.300 --> 00:31:33.667
Here is a strange and
bitter crop."

00:31:33.667 --> 00:31:35.500
The lyrics--

00:31:35.500 --> 00:31:39.467
and Billie Holiday is the one
who made the song famous, but

00:31:39.467 --> 00:31:46.133
really it was Abel Meeropol
that made the song such a

00:31:46.133 --> 00:31:47.767
great song.

00:31:47.767 --> 00:31:50.133
And I think the power of the
song really just comes from

00:31:50.133 --> 00:31:53.600
the contrast, the alternate
rhythm, between the kind of

00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:57.167
cliche image of the South, you
know the pastoral South, the

00:31:57.167 --> 00:31:59.867
magnolia, the smell of magnolia,
and then the smell

00:31:59.867 --> 00:32:00.767
of the burning flesh.

00:32:00.767 --> 00:32:04.033
It's that alternate rhythm that
generates the peculiar

00:32:04.033 --> 00:32:06.133
power of this song.

00:32:06.133 --> 00:32:11.300
So that's partly why lynching
was such an issue on

00:32:11.300 --> 00:32:14.600
everyone's consciousness
in the '30s.

00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:16.233
But there were also
other issues.

00:32:16.233 --> 00:32:20.467
And in fact, the song is a
great song, but it's also

00:32:20.467 --> 00:32:25.100
slightly misleading in a sense
that it's suggesting that

00:32:25.100 --> 00:32:29.100
lynching was strictly a Southern
phenomenon, which

00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:31.433
actually wasn't the case.

00:32:31.433 --> 00:32:35.833
And so all we have to do is to
look at this New Yorker cover

00:32:35.833 --> 00:32:39.133
on March 19, 1938.

00:32:39.133 --> 00:32:43.200
Very late, really very, very
late for this to be on the New

00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:46.167
Yorker's cover, this racist--

00:32:46.167 --> 00:32:49.367
just the Northern population
being flabbergasted at how

00:32:49.367 --> 00:32:54.867
lazy and drunken blacks are,
because they were migrating in

00:32:54.867 --> 00:32:56.533
large numbers to the North.

00:32:56.533 --> 00:33:00.967
So a relatively new phenomenon
in the twentieth century

00:33:00.967 --> 00:33:06.833
actually was the substantial
number of lynchings both in

00:33:06.833 --> 00:33:11.100
the Northeast and also in the
Midwest. So this is a kind of

00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:17.467
very famous double lynching of
Thomas Shipp and Abram Smith

00:33:17.467 --> 00:33:20.433
in Indiana in 1930.

00:33:20.433 --> 00:33:23.667
So once again, very,
very late for that.

00:33:23.667 --> 00:33:28.300
And it's because of these very
sensational lynchings in the

00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:37.767
North that the NAACP actually
had this regular practice of

00:33:37.767 --> 00:33:41.733
just hanging out a flag in
the New York City office

00:33:41.733 --> 00:33:45.000
announcing that a man was
lynched yesterday.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:47.667
And that was also
in the 1930s.

00:33:47.667 --> 00:33:53.233
So it was something that was
an ongoing problem and very

00:33:53.233 --> 00:33:58.500
much kind of a hot button
issue in the 1930s.

00:33:58.500 --> 00:34:02.100
So as a consequence of that,
there was an anti-lynching

00:34:02.100 --> 00:34:06.567
bill that was trying to make its
way through Congress and

00:34:06.567 --> 00:34:07.100
the Senate.

00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:12.067
And it passed in the House, but
because of a filibuster in

00:34:12.067 --> 00:34:15.667
the Senate, it led to the
withdrawal of the bill in

00:34:15.667 --> 00:34:18.667
February of 1938.

00:34:18.667 --> 00:34:25.400
So it was just something that
just never went away.

00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:30.367
It was an unresolved issue all
the way through the 1930s.

00:34:30.367 --> 00:34:33.867
And so Hemingway actually was
very much plugged into the

00:34:33.867 --> 00:34:36.833
politics of the United States
when all of a sudden he would

00:34:36.833 --> 00:34:40.100
make Robert Jordan suddenly make
a reference to lynching.

00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:45.033
But just to move away from that
history of lynching in

00:34:45.033 --> 00:34:49.833
the United States, back to
its impact on the Spanish

00:34:49.833 --> 00:34:51.400
environment.

00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:57.300
The response of Maria and
Pilar to lynching in the

00:34:57.300 --> 00:35:00.667
United States is once
again very odd.

00:35:00.667 --> 00:35:03.733
"'As I said, when they lifted
the Negro up for the second

00:35:03.733 --> 00:35:07.933
time, my mother pulled me away
from the window, so I saw no

00:35:07.933 --> 00:35:11.400
more,' Robert Jordan said.
'But since I have had

00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:14.733
experiences which demonstrate
that drunkenness is the same

00:35:14.733 --> 00:35:15.767
in my country.

00:35:15.767 --> 00:35:20.100
It is ugly and brutal.' 'You
were too young at seven,'

00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:22.667
Maria said. 'You were too
young for such things.

00:35:22.667 --> 00:35:25.533
I have never seen a Negro
except in a circus.

00:35:25.533 --> 00:35:29.600
Unless the Moors are Negroes.'
'Some are Negroes and some are

00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:33.667
not," Pilar said. 'I can talk
to you of the Moors.'"

00:35:33.667 --> 00:35:40.433
So this is mind-boggling, that
this should be the response to

00:35:40.433 --> 00:35:43.467
lynching in the United States.

00:35:43.467 --> 00:35:47.400
We can't even say that-- it
would be reassuring to say

00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:51.500
that it's just cultural
ignorance or the impossibility

00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:54.333
of cross-cultural understanding
that is

00:35:54.333 --> 00:35:58.933
resulting in the responses
from Maria and Pilar.

00:35:58.933 --> 00:36:01.967
It would be nice to be able just
to say, it's because they

00:36:01.967 --> 00:36:04.133
don't know anything about
the United States.

00:36:04.133 --> 00:36:06.767
But I really don't think
that that is the case.

00:36:06.767 --> 00:36:09.467
So I would invite you, actually,
this is something to

00:36:09.467 --> 00:36:10.500
think about.

00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:13.867
Why do Spanish always
have such weird --

00:36:13.867 --> 00:36:18.767
and that's putting it mildly --
weird responses to violence

00:36:18.767 --> 00:36:20.767
in the United States, period?

00:36:20.767 --> 00:36:23.933
The response is never
the right response.

00:36:23.933 --> 00:36:27.600
It's always so off-focus
that it's not

00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:29.767
even the wrong response.

00:36:29.767 --> 00:36:31.700
It's just hard to believe
that anyone would

00:36:31.700 --> 00:36:34.167
respond like that.

00:36:34.167 --> 00:36:40.467
But what we see right there is
that this once again weird

00:36:40.467 --> 00:36:44.700
invocation of the Moors in
conjunction with violence in

00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:45.367
the United States.

00:36:45.367 --> 00:36:49.233
So all we know is that when
they try to make sense of

00:36:49.233 --> 00:36:51.133
something they don't understand,
when the Spanish

00:36:51.133 --> 00:36:53.300
try to make sense of something
they don't understand, the

00:36:53.300 --> 00:36:58.100
Moors are the people who
come to their minds.

00:36:58.100 --> 00:37:03.033
But it's a moment where any
kind of communion between

00:37:03.033 --> 00:37:07.967
Robert and Maria and Pilar, any
previous communion between

00:37:07.967 --> 00:37:10.467
them is completely
breaking down.

00:37:10.467 --> 00:37:15.933
So I just wanted to talk about
another episode that has

00:37:15.933 --> 00:37:17.533
exactly the same kind
of construction of

00:37:17.533 --> 00:37:21.367
incomprehension, ignorance,
and incomprehension on the

00:37:21.367 --> 00:37:22.667
part of the Spanish.

00:37:22.667 --> 00:37:24.967
And this has to do with
the Republican party.

00:37:24.967 --> 00:37:28.800
You guys remember that the
leftists in Spain were the

00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:30.000
Republicans.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.267
They are defending the
Spanish Republic.

00:37:32.267 --> 00:37:35.567
So to be a Republican
in Spain means that

00:37:35.567 --> 00:37:37.100
you are on the left.

00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:40.600
And this is the context
for that conversation.

00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:43.933
"'My father was a Republican
all his life,' Maria said.

00:37:43.933 --> 00:37:47.033
'It was for that that they shot
him.' 'My father was also

00:37:47.033 --> 00:37:48.267
a Republican all his life.

00:37:48.267 --> 00:37:50.633
Also my grandfather,' Robert
Jordan said. 'In what

00:37:50.633 --> 00:37:54.500
country?' 'The United States.'
'Did they shoot them?' the

00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:55.733
woman asked.

00:37:55.733 --> 00:37:57.333
'Que va,' Maria said.

00:37:57.333 --> 00:37:59.533
'The United States is a country
of Republicans.

00:37:59.533 --> 00:38:02.633
They don't shoot you for being
a Republican there.' 'All the

00:38:02.633 --> 00:38:05.400
same, it is a good thing to have
a grandfather who was a

00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:09.267
Republican,' the woman said. 'It
shows a good blood.' 'My

00:38:09.267 --> 00:38:12.100
grandfather was on the
Republican national

00:38:12.100 --> 00:38:14.133
committee,' Robert
Jordan said.

00:38:14.133 --> 00:38:16.800
That impressed even Maria.

00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:18.633
'And is thy father still
active in the

00:38:18.633 --> 00:38:20.700
Republic?' Pilar asked.

00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:21.233
'No.

00:38:21.233 --> 00:38:26.600
He is dead.' 'Can one ask how
he died?' 'He shot himself.'

00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:29.467
'For avoiding being tortured?'
The woman asked.

00:38:29.467 --> 00:38:32.033
'Yes,' Robert Jordan said.

00:38:32.033 --> 00:38:35.167
'To avoid being tortured.'"

00:38:35.167 --> 00:38:38.100
So this is where we get
that mix of the

00:38:38.100 --> 00:38:39.967
comic and the tragic.

00:38:39.967 --> 00:38:42.833
It is a comedy of
errors so far.

00:38:42.833 --> 00:38:46.500
For a good part of that passage,
it is a comedy of

00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:48.867
cross-cultural error.

00:38:48.867 --> 00:38:53.067
Just not being able to wrap your
mind around the fact that

00:38:53.067 --> 00:38:55.200
to be a Republican in the
United States is a very

00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:58.167
different thing than being
a Republican in Spain.

00:38:58.167 --> 00:39:00.533
So just not being able to--

00:39:00.533 --> 00:39:05.433
this is just kind of permanent
blinders in the minds

00:39:05.433 --> 00:39:07.867
of Maria and Pilar.

00:39:07.867 --> 00:39:15.967
So if that were just the case,
it would go no further.

00:39:15.967 --> 00:39:22.567
That would just be a moment of
comic relief in For Whom the

00:39:22.567 --> 00:39:24.333
Bell Tolls.

00:39:24.333 --> 00:39:28.833
But as is always the case with
Hemingway in this particular

00:39:28.833 --> 00:39:34.467
novel, the comic suddenly morphs
into something else

00:39:34.467 --> 00:39:36.633
without any warning.

00:39:36.633 --> 00:39:40.400
So all of a sudden we get the
detail about Robert Jordan's

00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:43.667
father shooting himself to
avoid being tortured.

00:39:43.667 --> 00:39:47.067
And that can have only one
meaning for the Spanish.

00:39:47.067 --> 00:39:50.600
It fits completely into the
personal history of Maria.

00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:53.467
It fits completely into Pilar's
understanding of

00:39:53.467 --> 00:39:55.500
political history in Spain.

00:39:55.500 --> 00:40:00.000
But right now we don't know why
his father killed himself

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:02.900
and what kind of torture
he is talking about.

00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:06.867
So we have to wait a little
longer to have that mystery

00:40:06.867 --> 00:40:09.000
cleared up for us.

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:12.633
And to have that mystery cleared
up, we actually have

00:40:12.633 --> 00:40:18.100
to go further into the past.
So I've been talking about

00:40:18.100 --> 00:40:22.233
distant homes in times just
of spatial locations.

00:40:22.233 --> 00:40:26.300
But there's also a distant
temporal home.

00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:29.333
In turns out that the nineteenth
century is also a

00:40:29.333 --> 00:40:31.633
necessary home for
Robert Jordan,

00:40:31.633 --> 00:40:33.567
especially the Civil War.

00:40:33.567 --> 00:40:36.833
It's almost the equivalent
of Paris in terms of

00:40:36.833 --> 00:40:40.567
psychological need
for that home.

00:40:40.567 --> 00:40:44.067
And it's not just any
Civil War, but his

00:40:44.067 --> 00:40:44.600
grandfather's Civil War.

00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:46.867
And this is his moment
of homecoming.

00:40:46.867 --> 00:40:50.533
This is the home that will
receive him and shelter him.

00:40:50.533 --> 00:40:53.400
"Remember something concrete
and practical.

00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:57.067
Remember Grandfather's saber,
bright and well oiled in its

00:40:57.067 --> 00:41:00.167
dented scabbard and Grandfather
showed you how the

00:41:00.167 --> 00:41:03.633
blade had been thinned from the
many times it had been to

00:41:03.633 --> 00:41:04.933
the grinder's.

00:41:04.933 --> 00:41:06.967
Remember Grandfather's
Smith and Wesson.

00:41:06.967 --> 00:41:12.033
It was a single action,
officer's model .32 caliber

00:41:12.033 --> 00:41:13.933
and there was no
trigger guard.

00:41:13.933 --> 00:41:17.933
It had the softest, sweetest
trigger pull you had ever felt

00:41:17.933 --> 00:41:21.467
and it was always well oiled
and the bore was clean

00:41:21.467 --> 00:41:25.467
although the finish was all worn
off and the brown metal

00:41:25.467 --> 00:41:28.567
of the barrel and the cylinder
was worn smooth from the

00:41:28.567 --> 00:41:31.000
leather of the holster."

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:33.967
So this is, like Hemingway's
description of the trout

00:41:33.967 --> 00:41:36.033
fishing in In Our Time.

00:41:36.033 --> 00:41:38.333
Very, very clean,
the smoothness,

00:41:38.333 --> 00:41:41.033
cleanness of their operation.

00:41:41.033 --> 00:41:45.433
But in this particular context
the smoothness and the

00:41:45.433 --> 00:41:49.233
cleanness and the worn-out-ness
of that pistol

00:41:49.233 --> 00:41:52.400
suggests that this is
a well-used weapon.

00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:56.733
Robert Johnson's grandfather was
a hero of the Civil War.

00:41:56.733 --> 00:41:59.500
His saber had been to the
grinder's numerous times

00:41:59.500 --> 00:42:03.633
because the blade had
been so well used.

00:42:03.633 --> 00:42:07.433
So without saying anything,
without using the word "glory"

00:42:07.433 --> 00:42:13.300
or "heroic" or any comparable
adjective, Hemingway gives us

00:42:13.300 --> 00:42:18.867
the sense that the Civil War was
the heroic moment, was the

00:42:18.867 --> 00:42:23.300
high point, in the history
of Robert's family.

00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:26.400
And it was very much vested
in his grandfather.

00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:28.667
And at that point,
it has receded.

00:42:28.667 --> 00:42:31.967
It has to recede, it has to be
receded into the past. It

00:42:31.967 --> 00:42:33.567
belongs to the nineteenth
century.

00:42:33.567 --> 00:42:36.133
But Robert Jordan wants to
activate it over and over

00:42:36.133 --> 00:42:39.233
again, bring it up to the
twentieth century because he

00:42:39.233 --> 00:42:40.300
needs that.

00:42:40.300 --> 00:42:46.900
And we know why he needs to
bring the nineteenth century

00:42:46.900 --> 00:42:50.933
back on the next page
when we know what

00:42:50.933 --> 00:42:53.333
happens to that pistol.

00:42:53.333 --> 00:42:57.233
"Then after you father had shot
himself with the pistol,

00:42:57.233 --> 00:43:00.100
and you had come home from
school and they'd had the

00:43:00.100 --> 00:43:03.967
funeral, the coroner had
returned it after the inquest

00:43:03.967 --> 00:43:10.100
saying, "Bob, I guess you might
want to keep the gun."

00:43:10.100 --> 00:43:12.233
OK, I should just stop and
clarify that this is something

00:43:12.233 --> 00:43:15.000
we'll be talking about,
actually the narrative

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:17.667
switches from second person
pronoun, Robert Jordan

00:43:17.667 --> 00:43:19.200
addressing himself as you.

00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:22.000
So that you is Robert Jordan,
and then it switches back to

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:23.667
the third person.

00:43:23.667 --> 00:43:27.800
"He climbed out on a rock and
leaned over and saw his face

00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:32.000
in the still water, and saw
himself holding the gun, and

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:36.567
then he dropped it, holding it
by the muzzle and saw it go

00:43:36.567 --> 00:43:39.700
down making bubbles until it
was just as big as a watch

00:43:39.700 --> 00:43:45.500
charm in the clear water and
then it was out of sight." So

00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:51.433
this passage that comes just on
the opposite page from the

00:43:51.433 --> 00:43:55.600
previous invocation of the
Civil War weapons of the

00:43:55.600 --> 00:44:00.733
grandfather tell us exactly why
the nineteenth century and

00:44:00.733 --> 00:44:05.833
the Civil War is a necessary
emotional shelter for Robert.

00:44:05.833 --> 00:44:09.400
He's just so ashamed
of his father.

00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:13.700
He wants to clean up that entire
episode, drop it into

00:44:13.700 --> 00:44:16.133
the clear water so
that it will be

00:44:16.133 --> 00:44:18.767
completely out of sight.

00:44:18.767 --> 00:44:20.700
He can do that to the pistol.

00:44:20.700 --> 00:44:24.733
He can't do it to the actual
history itself, but that's as

00:44:24.733 --> 00:44:30.000
close as he can get to wiping
out that history.

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:35.933
And so in this moment actually,
there is no Spanish

00:44:35.933 --> 00:44:38.900
environment that is invoked.

00:44:38.900 --> 00:44:42.567
This is no mention of the
immediate Spanish setting.

00:44:42.567 --> 00:44:47.400
And I think that that is
suggestive as well, in a sense

00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:52.633
that really the home is for
Robert, I think, and it's a

00:44:52.633 --> 00:44:55.867
very pessimistic reading
of the novel.

00:44:55.867 --> 00:44:58.233
There are basically just
two homes for Robert.

00:44:58.233 --> 00:45:04.233
One is the Paris of the
evening papers and the

00:45:04.233 --> 00:45:05.633
chestnut trees.

00:45:05.633 --> 00:45:10.200
And the other home for him is
a home that never was a home

00:45:10.200 --> 00:45:14.167
that was in his lifetime, but
a home that he can inherit

00:45:14.167 --> 00:45:16.733
vicariously through
his grandfather.

00:45:16.733 --> 00:45:21.200
And that is the American Civil
War as his spiritual home.

00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:25.267
Because this is the one place
where he has affirmation of

00:45:25.267 --> 00:45:28.400
himself, that he's not ashamed
of himself, not ashamed of his

00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:30.067
family history.

00:45:30.067 --> 00:45:32.500
And so those are impossible
homes for him at this point.

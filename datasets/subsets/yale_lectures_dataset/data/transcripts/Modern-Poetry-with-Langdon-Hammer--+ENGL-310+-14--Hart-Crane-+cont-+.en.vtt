00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:13.750
Professor Langdon
Hammer: The Bridge.

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:18.062
In order to get to The
Bridge I want to go back and

00:00:18.062 --> 00:00:22.602
just say a few more things about
"Voyages" and about Crane in

00:00:22.602 --> 00:00:26.630
general.
In Crane's letter to the

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:32.220
distressed editor of
Poetry magazine,

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:39.890
Harriet Monroe – that prose
selection included in the back

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:47.560
of your book – Crane defends
his poem "At Melville's Tomb"

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:55.880
and specifically defends what he
calls his "recourse to the logic

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:00.692
of metaphor."
What does "the logic of

00:01:00.692 --> 00:01:02.899
metaphor" mean for Crane?
 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:10.576
Well, he distinguishes his
criteria from Monroe's,

00:01:10.576 --> 00:01:14.099
on page 968.
He says:

00:01:14.099 --> 00:01:17.516
My poem may well be
elliptical and actually

00:01:17.516 --> 00:01:20.294
obscure..
but in your criticism… you

00:01:20.294 --> 00:01:24.282
have stated your objections in
terms that allow me… the

00:01:24.282 --> 00:01:28.840
privilege of claiming your ideas
and ideals as theoretically,

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.310
at least, quite outside the
issues of my own aspirations.

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.355
[And he says:]
To put it more plainly,

00:01:36.355 --> 00:01:40.800
as a poet I may very possibly
be more interested in the

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:46.480
so-called illogical impingements
of the connotations of… [well,

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.022
that's a misprint:
it should be "words"]

00:01:49.022 --> 00:01:52.934
on the consciousness (and their
combinations and interplay in

00:01:52.934 --> 00:01:56.386
metaphor on this basis),
than I am interested in the

00:01:56.386 --> 00:02:00.120
preservation of their logically
rigid significations...

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:07.607
Crane is talking here about
putting a kind of priority in

00:02:07.607 --> 00:02:13.490
his poetry on connotation over
denotation.

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:19.508
He's interested in the ways
words relate to and through

00:02:19.508 --> 00:02:25.527
other words, before or in
addition to the ways in which

00:02:25.527 --> 00:02:30.319
they relate to the things of the
world.

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:36.205
In this sense,
Crane introduces us to a sense

00:02:36.205 --> 00:02:43.697
of poetry as a linguistic
environment that is constructed

00:02:43.697 --> 00:02:51.188
through words relating among
themselves in ways that play

00:02:51.188 --> 00:02:58.179
upon our imagination,
systems of association that in

00:02:58.179 --> 00:03:04.599
effect solicit our contribution
to complete the thought,

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:10.410
all of which supposes and seeks
a kind of special intimacy with

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:16.509
us as readers,
and gives us work to do.

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:21.964
I suggested that the sea is a
kind of figure or metaphor in

00:03:21.964 --> 00:03:27.794
Crane's work for this linguistic
space: an imaginative space to

00:03:27.794 --> 00:03:30.240
which we are summoned.
 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:37.183
In a poem like "At Melville's
Tomb," he's concerned with

00:03:37.183 --> 00:03:43.370
specifically how messages are
transported with,

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:49.080
well, what he calls "the dice
of drowned men's bones."

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:55.360
You can understand the poem as
an elegy for Melville.

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:00.027
It's also about reading
Melville and getting his

00:04:00.027 --> 00:04:04.115
message;
that is, reaching back into the

00:04:04.115 --> 00:04:07.211
past and becoming,
for Melville,

00:04:07.211 --> 00:04:13.303
the kind of reader that Crane
himself seeks as he describes it

00:04:13.303 --> 00:04:16.199
in his letter to Monroe.
 

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:22.188
In talking about "Voyages II,"
I suggested that the--or

00:04:22.188 --> 00:04:27.361
"Voyages III," rather,
the third section of the

00:04:27.361 --> 00:04:33.954
poem--I suggested that the image
of "infinite consanguinity" was

00:04:33.954 --> 00:04:38.664
in part an image of this
linguistic mixing and

00:04:38.664 --> 00:04:44.420
promiscuity that Crane is
interested in in poetry.

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:49.670
In this poem,
the mixing of words in poetry

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:55.920
is analogized to the mixing of
bodies of lovers.

00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:03.745
Love here is also like death
because it's a shattering

00:05:03.745 --> 00:05:12.456
experience through which the
self is remade and changed with

00:05:12.456 --> 00:05:16.000
and through another.
 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.980
This is a process of
transformation.

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:23.809
It's one that Crane calls
"transmemberment," which is a

00:05:23.809 --> 00:05:28.370
way of evoking not so much a
sharing of identity,

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:31.797
but rather some kind of
exchange of it,

00:05:31.797 --> 00:05:36.667
which is an experience of the
self changed and the self

00:05:36.667 --> 00:05:40.208
redeemed.
In Crane's eyes this is exactly

00:05:40.208 --> 00:05:44.258
what The Waste Land
contemplates and draws back

00:05:44.258 --> 00:05:46.610
from;
doesn't embrace,

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:51.008
turns away from.
It's what, in Crane,

00:05:51.008 --> 00:05:56.360
love promises.
It's what poetry, song promises.

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:00.564
The space of the poem,
which is like,

00:06:00.564 --> 00:06:04.885
as Crane imagines it,
a space of love,

00:06:04.885 --> 00:06:09.089
is set apart from ordinary
life.

00:06:09.089 --> 00:06:16.133
You might contrast the kind of
song and singing that you find

00:06:16.133 --> 00:06:22.120
in this poem with Eliot's love
song for Prufrock.

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:28.569
Crane recovers in this poem a
kind of heroic blank verse,

00:06:28.569 --> 00:06:34.740
the medium of heroic drama,
and uses it for the speech of a

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:40.128
poet-lover who celebrates the
power of sound to make its own

00:06:40.128 --> 00:06:44.123
sense,
through the affirming force of

00:06:44.123 --> 00:06:46.254
desire.
He imagines this,

00:06:46.254 --> 00:06:49.654
again, as a kind of
resurrection of some kind,

00:06:49.654 --> 00:06:54.112
what he talks about as what has
to happen after The Waste

00:06:54.112 --> 00:06:56.513
Land.
In this sense,

00:06:56.513 --> 00:07:01.983
Crane is talking about some
kind of passage through death,

00:07:01.983 --> 00:07:07.550
and you can understand that
death as Crane's admission,

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:17.024
as I suggested last time,
of the illusory nature of

00:07:17.024 --> 00:07:25.679
rhetoric, of love itself,
of the power of desire,

00:07:25.679 --> 00:07:33.990
which Crane is always realistic
about, you could say.

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:39.746
The poem, "Voyages,"
treats--its theme is really the

00:07:39.746 --> 00:07:43.810
triumph of desire,
even in defeat.

00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:50.260
That's also the theme of "At
Melville's Tomb," and it's the

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:56.154
grand theme of The
Bridge. The Bridge is

00:07:56.154 --> 00:08:00.269
Crane's great poem about
America.

00:08:00.269 --> 00:08:05.000
Let me bring up a picture of
him.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:11.259
This is Crane in 1927 or '28.
 

00:08:11.259 --> 00:08:15.813
It's unclear exactly when the
photo was taken by Walker Evans,

00:08:15.813 --> 00:08:19.620
a great American photographer
and Crane's friend,

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:25.095
on top of 110 Columbia Heights
where Crane lived,

00:08:25.095 --> 00:08:29.430
in view of Manhattan and the
bridge,

00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:32.210
the Brooklyn Bridge.
 

00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:36.593
The Bridge is Crane's
great poem about America or

00:08:36.593 --> 00:08:40.897
about the idea of America,
and I'll say more about what

00:08:40.897 --> 00:08:43.049
that means in a moment.
 

00:08:43.049 --> 00:08:47.293
And it's a reply,
self-consciously so,

00:08:47.293 --> 00:08:50.389
to The Waste Land.
 

00:08:50.389 --> 00:08:56.490
I suggested that the shortness
of The Waste Land was in

00:08:56.490 --> 00:09:01.889
some ways a kind of argument
against epic in the modern

00:09:01.889 --> 00:09:05.145
world,
an argument about the

00:09:05.145 --> 00:09:11.483
impossibility of epic vision in
a culture which lacks shared

00:09:11.483 --> 00:09:14.590
myths,
shared symbols.

00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:20.023
Against this lack Crane
proposes the bridge,

00:09:20.023 --> 00:09:26.468
the Brooklyn Bridge,
as a kind of central organizing

00:09:26.468 --> 00:09:30.259
symbol for modern culture.
 

00:09:30.259 --> 00:09:36.602
This is a picture of the bridge
being built in the nineteenth

00:09:36.602 --> 00:09:40.011
century.
It's important that as Crane

00:09:40.011 --> 00:09:45.303
looks at the bridge as a modern
symbol, that we remember that it

00:09:45.303 --> 00:09:47.320
wasn't built in 1920.
 

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:50.459
I've forgotten now the year in
which it is, but it was at

00:09:50.459 --> 00:09:53.149
least, I think,
sixty years old at this point.

00:09:53.149 --> 00:09:57.793
And you can see when Roebling's
bridge was first created,

00:09:57.793 --> 00:10:01.940
there's no Manhattan skyline
for it to reach to.

00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:06.878
When Crane turns to the bridge
as a symbol of the modern,

00:10:06.878 --> 00:10:12.169
he's already looking back to an
earlier vision of the modern,

00:10:12.169 --> 00:10:16.965
if you like.
And in doing so he is joining

00:10:16.965 --> 00:10:20.350
many other American artists.
 

00:10:20.350 --> 00:10:28.996
This is a photograph by Walker
Evans, who took many images of

00:10:28.996 --> 00:10:35.769
the bridge with its cables and
Gothic arches,

00:10:35.769 --> 00:10:40.690
all of which play into Crane's
poems in complex ways.

00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:46.821
This is the very great poem,
one of many--or painting by

00:10:46.821 --> 00:10:51.949
Joseph Stella that appears in
the Yale Gallery:

00:10:51.949 --> 00:10:56.913
a fantastic work,
one that Crane hadn't seen

00:10:56.913 --> 00:11:02.666
actually when he began The
Bridge, but which in all

00:11:02.666 --> 00:11:07.409
sorts of ways is harmonious with
his vision,

00:11:07.409 --> 00:11:16.974
including the ways in which the
sublime vision that it offers

00:11:16.974 --> 00:11:24.338
includes darkness and,
I would have to say,

00:11:24.338 --> 00:11:31.769
perhaps frightening or sinister
elements.

00:11:31.769 --> 00:11:39.925
It is also importantly a moment
in American art when artists

00:11:39.925 --> 00:11:46.436
like Stella, like Crane,
are interested--here's John

00:11:46.436 --> 00:11:51.838
Marin with another image,
this one painted from the

00:11:51.838 --> 00:11:57.996
bridge--in which artists are
creating a kind of idiom that

00:11:57.996 --> 00:12:02.210
involves and includes
abstraction,

00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:09.490
shows us images of the world in
realist representation that are

00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:16.769
being transformed into something
semi-abstract and symbolic.

00:12:16.769 --> 00:12:22.084
Crane is very much involved in
the same kind of activity as

00:12:22.084 --> 00:12:26.874
these artists.
These are more images from

00:12:26.874 --> 00:12:29.946
Evans;
these, of course,

00:12:29.946 --> 00:12:37.370
shot from underneath the bridge
and showing it as a kind of

00:12:37.370 --> 00:12:43.769
abstract form rising into the
New York skyline.

00:12:43.769 --> 00:12:54.164
This is the title page of
Crane's poem as it appeared in

00:12:54.164 --> 00:13:01.658
the Black Sun edition,
a limited edition in Paris in

00:13:01.658 --> 00:13:07.676
1930, its first publication
followed shortly thereafter by a

00:13:07.676 --> 00:13:10.429
publication in New York.
 

00:13:10.429 --> 00:13:18.010
Crane took the Brooklyn Bridge
as a kind of symbol of a

00:13:18.010 --> 00:13:24.889
structure, the structure of a
spiritual action,

00:13:24.889 --> 00:13:28.080
as he understood it,
underpinning American history.

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:33.650
It seemed to him to embody an
idea that he saw variously

00:13:33.650 --> 00:13:36.789
embodied in American history.
 

00:13:36.789 --> 00:13:43.726
For Crane, American history is
a series of new world visions,

00:13:43.726 --> 00:13:51.240
all of them versions or avatars
of what he also calls Atlantis,

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:57.585
the city sunk beneath the waves
in Platonic myth that promises

00:13:57.585 --> 00:14:03.929
to return and return us to some
kind of redeemed community.

00:14:03.929 --> 00:14:10.254
Atlantis is Crane's name for a
kind of promised relation to the

00:14:10.254 --> 00:14:14.639
world that's been glimpsed but
also lost.

00:14:14.639 --> 00:14:18.729
To aim at Atlantis,
as the poem does,

00:14:18.729 --> 00:14:23.500
and as Crane says American
history does,

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:27.309
is to go interestingly,
confusingly,

00:14:27.309 --> 00:14:32.860
simultaneously into the past
and into the future;

00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:37.895
to rescue or recover something
from history,

00:14:37.895 --> 00:14:42.808
promised for the future;
and to bring that future into

00:14:42.808 --> 00:14:46.229
being.
Crane understands the mythic

00:14:46.229 --> 00:14:51.107
work of the poem,
his poem, as a kind of active

00:14:51.107 --> 00:14:54.656
crossing,
one that has this chronological

00:14:54.656 --> 00:14:58.695
mission of going back into the
past and forward into the

00:14:58.695 --> 00:15:02.100
future.
The title page here – you

00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:06.055
can't make it out,
but it's clear in your

00:15:06.055 --> 00:15:11.395
anthology – carries an
epigraph from The Book of Job:

00:15:11.395 --> 00:15:15.450
"From going to and fro in the
earth,

00:15:15.450 --> 00:15:17.970
/ and from walking up and down
in it."

00:15:17.970 --> 00:15:23.219
The epigraph from Job
introduces these two motions as

00:15:23.219 --> 00:15:28.570
being essential to Crane's
imagination in the poem;

00:15:28.570 --> 00:15:32.597
that is, going to and fro,
back and forth,

00:15:32.597 --> 00:15:35.250
and by going up and down.
 

00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:43.075
You can see these two motions,
in fact, easily visualizable in

00:15:43.075 --> 00:15:50.402
the form of the bridge itself,
which drives its pylons into

00:15:50.402 --> 00:15:57.306
the river and rises up in these
Gothic structures in order to

00:15:57.306 --> 00:16:02.830
carry people back and forth
across the river.

00:16:02.830 --> 00:16:08.442
The epigraph is also a kind of
joke because Crane wrote this

00:16:08.442 --> 00:16:13.015
poem, like Job,
tramping around across the

00:16:13.015 --> 00:16:18.700
Northeast from one apartment or
house to another,

00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:27.378
or one couch to another;
and wrote it in Europe and

00:16:27.378 --> 00:16:34.484
California and elsewhere,
himself, Crane,

00:16:34.484 --> 00:16:45.143
being without a secure station
in the poem, in the writing of

00:16:45.143 --> 00:16:51.626
the poem.
Crane's interest in the poem in

00:16:51.626 --> 00:16:59.104
hobos and marginals of many
kinds, as well as with pioneers

00:16:59.104 --> 00:17:07.643
and other kinds of travelers,
all represent figures of

00:17:07.643 --> 00:17:19.046
spiritual questers who are in a
sense without a station in life

00:17:19.046 --> 00:17:27.180
but rather in motion,
as Crane himself was.

00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:32.039
This is the table of contents
of the poem.

00:17:32.039 --> 00:17:37.687
It's helpful,
I think, to look at it because

00:17:37.687 --> 00:17:42.023
it's confusing.
The poem consists in this

00:17:42.023 --> 00:17:45.810
proem, which I'll talk about in
a few moments,

00:17:45.810 --> 00:17:49.849
where Crane actually dedicates
his long poem,

00:17:49.849 --> 00:17:52.973
actually dedicates this poem to
the Brooklyn Bridge – as if

00:17:52.973 --> 00:17:55.160
you could dedicate a poem to the
bridge,

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:58.473
to an object;
a first section,

00:17:58.473 --> 00:18:03.846
called "Ave Maria," which is
spoken by Columbus – Columbus,

00:18:03.846 --> 00:18:09.400
not on his way to the New World
but rather on his way back.

00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:15.626
He speaks to us on his way
back, and it introduces the

00:18:15.626 --> 00:18:22.557
theme of carrying the message or
the vision forward into the

00:18:22.557 --> 00:18:27.256
future.
The question of how to retrieve

00:18:27.256 --> 00:18:33.960
or recover the vision of the New
World is initially introduced

00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:37.240
there.
Then there's a section called

00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:41.269
"Powhatan's Daughter," which
refers to Pocahontas,

00:18:41.269 --> 00:18:48.461
invokes a vision of the
American continent through a

00:18:48.461 --> 00:18:53.819
series of poems:
"The Harbor Dance,"

00:18:53.819 --> 00:19:03.750
"Van Winkle," "The River," "The
Dance," and "Indiana," which all

00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:13.523
explore various moments in the
history of the conquering of the

00:19:13.523 --> 00:19:20.155
continent.
There's a section called "Cutty

00:19:20.155 --> 00:19:28.577
Sark" which introduces us to a
drunken visionary sailor in a

00:19:28.577 --> 00:19:34.430
bar on Sand Street in Lower
Manhattan.

00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:39.607
That figure seems to
metamorphose into Walt Whitman

00:19:39.607 --> 00:19:44.268
in Section IV,
"Cape Hatteras," in a sense the

00:19:44.268 --> 00:19:46.650
center of the poem.
 

00:19:46.650 --> 00:19:55.260
"Cape Hatteras" is concerned
with the invention of flight,

00:19:55.260 --> 00:20:03.115
and it links Whitman to,
really, the whole history of

00:20:03.115 --> 00:20:06.589
American invention.
 

00:20:06.589 --> 00:20:11.750
There is a series of songs
called "Three Songs";

00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:21.040
another section called "Quaker
Hill," evoking a 1920s New York

00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:26.522
suburb, really,
or Connecticut Hills,

00:20:26.522 --> 00:20:32.309
which brings us up to the
present;

00:20:32.309 --> 00:20:36.136
as does the poem,
"The Tunnel"--the tunnel being

00:20:36.136 --> 00:20:40.289
that most closely based on
The Waste Land and

00:20:40.289 --> 00:20:44.930
describing a kind of infernal
journey through the New York

00:20:44.930 --> 00:20:49.623
subways;
and then finally "Atlantis," a

00:20:49.623 --> 00:20:57.086
kind of visionary rhapsody that
invokes the object of quest that

00:20:57.086 --> 00:21:00.640
the poem is concerned with.
 

00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:07.039
The poem in this way charts
various journeys westward and

00:21:07.039 --> 00:21:11.039
eastward, back and forth in
time.

00:21:11.039 --> 00:21:17.744
Discovery means nothing without
the relaying of the vision,

00:21:17.744 --> 00:21:20.750
the carrying it forward.
 

00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:27.841
The Bridge is concerned
with, in these various sections,

00:21:27.841 --> 00:21:33.194
with a series of symbols,
symbols that are very

00:21:33.194 --> 00:21:39.016
frequently vehicles or
transports, from Columbus's ship

00:21:39.016 --> 00:21:43.461
to the subway,
to the Wright Brothers'

00:21:43.461 --> 00:21:46.879
airplanes.
Transport: this is,

00:21:46.879 --> 00:21:52.589
in a sense, the grand theme of
The Bridge.

00:21:52.589 --> 00:21:58.390
The root meaning of metaphor is
"to carry something over," to

00:21:58.390 --> 00:22:03.839
transport it.
For Crane, metaphor is as

00:22:03.839 --> 00:22:13.440
central a concept and activity
as translation is for Pound.

00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:19.509
But in Crane the emphasis is on
imaginative transformation.

00:22:19.509 --> 00:22:22.759
That's really what metaphor has
to offer.

00:22:22.759 --> 00:22:27.496
The central symbol of The
Bridge, the bridge itself,

00:22:27.496 --> 00:22:31.579
you could understand as a
metaphor for metaphor;

00:22:31.579 --> 00:22:38.111
a metaphor for a primary human
capacity, the capacity to posit

00:22:38.111 --> 00:22:44.429
an object of desire – "Frosted
eyes there were that lifted

00:22:44.429 --> 00:22:50.425
altars" – to posit an object
of desire that expands the

00:22:50.425 --> 00:22:54.848
horizon of the real,
what's possible,

00:22:54.848 --> 00:23:00.277
and in so doing violates
existing systems of cognition

00:23:00.277 --> 00:23:04.579
and projects the vision of a new
world.

00:23:04.579 --> 00:23:09.037
This also means that the poem
is constantly producing new

00:23:09.037 --> 00:23:12.460
symbols for this activity,
new metaphors.

00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:16.706
Crane said in one letter,
"The bridge in becoming a ship,

00:23:16.706 --> 00:23:19.359
a world, a woman,
a tremendous harp,

00:23:19.359 --> 00:23:23.530
as it finally does,
seems really to have a career."

00:23:23.530 --> 00:23:28.139
And so it does.
This is, again,

00:23:28.139 --> 00:23:32.151
the Black Sun edition,
which I recommend that you go

00:23:32.151 --> 00:23:34.589
to the Beinecke and look at.
 

00:23:34.589 --> 00:23:37.789
It's one of the most beautiful
books I know.

00:23:37.789 --> 00:23:44.370
It's a great big book with
these big margins and red

00:23:44.370 --> 00:23:49.672
headings.
Let's look at the proem as both

00:23:49.672 --> 00:23:56.185
an introduction to the poem and
as a kind of summary,

00:23:56.185 --> 00:24:00.068
in miniature,
of its intentions,

00:24:00.068 --> 00:24:05.038
claims, procedures:
How many dawns,

00:24:05.038 --> 00:24:09.334
chill from his rippling rest
The seagull's wings

00:24:09.334 --> 00:24:14.105
shall dip and pivot him,
Shedding white rings of

00:24:14.105 --> 00:24:17.765
tumult, building high
Over the chained bay

00:24:17.765 --> 00:24:22.798
waters Liberty --
Then, with inviolate curve,

00:24:22.798 --> 00:24:27.463
forsake our eyes
 As apparitional as

00:24:27.463 --> 00:24:31.053
sails that cross
 Some page of figures to

00:24:31.053 --> 00:24:34.174
be filed away;
 --Till elevators drop

00:24:34.174 --> 00:24:39.231
us from our day…
The poem begins with another

00:24:39.231 --> 00:24:43.364
resurrection of some kind;
in this case,

00:24:43.364 --> 00:24:49.283
not a seal rising from the
water to gaze toward paradise,

00:24:49.283 --> 00:24:54.779
but rather a seagull rising as
many times before,

00:24:54.779 --> 00:24:57.634
"How many dawns,
chill from his rippling

00:24:57.634 --> 00:25:03.960
rest."
And this seagull becomes a kind

00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:09.470
of image of ascent and flight.
 

00:25:09.470 --> 00:25:15.599
I guess it is an initial image
of transport.

00:25:15.599 --> 00:25:20.656
The bird sheds "white rings
of tumult" and there's that

00:25:20.656 --> 00:25:23.640
word from "Voyages III,"
remember?

00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:26.355
"And where death,
if shed, / presumes no carnage,

00:25:26.355 --> 00:25:27.940
but this single change..."
 

00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:31.429
Here, again,
there's an action of shedding

00:25:31.429 --> 00:25:36.365
as the bird throws off the
darkness of the night and rises,

00:25:36.365 --> 00:25:40.110
"building high," then
disappears.

00:25:40.110 --> 00:25:41.750
The vision vanishes.
 

00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:46.450
We are in the world of work,
we are in the office spaces of

00:25:46.450 --> 00:25:49.606
Lower Manhattan,"
--Till elevators drop us

00:25:49.606 --> 00:25:52.720
from our day…" And if
we've just gone up now,

00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:56.339
we go down again:
I think of cinemas,

00:25:56.339 --> 00:25:59.526
panoramic sleights
 With multitudes bent

00:25:59.526 --> 00:26:03.507
toward some flashing scene
 Never disclosed,

00:26:03.507 --> 00:26:07.727
but hastened to again,
 Foretold to other eyes

00:26:07.727 --> 00:26:11.367
on the same screen….
The movie theater:

00:26:11.367 --> 00:26:15.454
the movie theater is a new
machine of transport in the

00:26:15.454 --> 00:26:19.522
twenties,
a kind of mass entertainment

00:26:19.522 --> 00:26:25.246
that Crane's poem will,
in a sense, try to rival and

00:26:25.246 --> 00:26:32.430
provide a complementary way of
imagining a collective vision.

00:26:32.430 --> 00:26:37.965
And what he offers next is the
bridge, which he addresses in

00:26:37.965 --> 00:26:43.032
this archaic language –
archaic and intimate language

00:26:43.032 --> 00:26:48.380
– as if Brooklyn Bridge could
have a subjectivity:

00:26:48.380 --> 00:26:53.248
And Thee [he
says], across the

00:26:53.248 --> 00:26:57.930
harbor, silver-paced [as if
the light on the

00:26:57.930 --> 00:27:03.240
bridge were being seen as a
kind of movement that the bridge

00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:07.246
was itself involved in]
As though the sun took step

00:27:07.246 --> 00:27:10.033
of thee, yet left
 Some motion ever

00:27:10.033 --> 00:27:13.784
unspent in thy stride,--
 Implicitly thy freedom

00:27:13.784 --> 00:27:18.315
staying thee!
This is a wild kind of address

00:27:18.315 --> 00:27:22.779
to architecture,
as if the bridge were animate

00:27:22.779 --> 00:27:28.930
with the power of motion and as
if it had a kind of motion that

00:27:28.930 --> 00:27:33.890
was fountain-like and could not
be exhausted.

00:27:33.890 --> 00:27:38.250
Then suddenly,
we're given another vision.

00:27:38.250 --> 00:27:44.349
 
 

00:27:44.349 --> 00:27:50.599
The threat of suicide suddenly
rises up in the poem:

00:27:50.599 --> 00:27:54.039
Out of some subway
scuttle, cell or loft

00:27:54.039 --> 00:27:56.819
 A bedlamite speeds to
thy parapets,

00:27:56.819 --> 00:28:00.599
 Tilting there momently,
shrill shirt ballooning,

00:28:00.599 --> 00:28:07.250
 A jest falls from the
speechless caravan.

00:28:07.250 --> 00:28:15.034
The possibility of failure
seems dialectically to be

00:28:15.034 --> 00:28:24.039
written into this poem's grand
ambition, its wish for ascent

00:28:24.039 --> 00:28:31.913
and redemption.
Crane turns them to images of

00:28:31.913 --> 00:28:38.259
the bridge in the New York
skyline:

00:28:38.259 --> 00:28:41.584
Down Wall,
from girder into street noon

00:28:41.584 --> 00:28:44.030
leaks,
 A rip-tooth of the

00:28:44.030 --> 00:28:47.158
sky's acetylene;
 All afternoon the

00:28:47.158 --> 00:28:51.624
cloud-flown derricks turn…
 Thy cables breathe the

00:28:51.624 --> 00:28:56.579
North Atlantic still.
As if it were a kind of ship.

00:28:56.579 --> 00:29:03.538
I don't know about you,
but I am thrilled every time I

00:29:03.538 --> 00:29:10.365
read Crane's language for
evoking the kind of sensual

00:29:10.365 --> 00:29:14.960
power of New York architecture.
 

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:18.289
O harp and altar,
of the fury fused,

00:29:18.289 --> 00:29:22.814
 (How could mere toil
align thy choiring strings!)

00:29:22.814 --> 00:29:27.782
[the bridge is harp and
altar--instrument of music and

00:29:27.782 --> 00:29:31.283
site of worship]
Terrific threshold of the

00:29:31.283 --> 00:29:33.756
prophet's pledge,
 Prayer of pariah,

00:29:33.756 --> 00:29:39.099
and the lover's cry,--
Again the traffic lights

00:29:39.099 --> 00:29:44.033
that skim thy swift
 Unfractioned idiom,

00:29:44.033 --> 00:29:47.802
immaculate sigh of stars,
 Beading thy

00:29:47.802 --> 00:29:52.559
path--condense eternity:
 And we have seen night

00:29:52.559 --> 00:29:57.171
lifted in thine arms.
Under thy shadow by the

00:29:57.171 --> 00:30:01.506
piers I waited;
 Only in darkness is thy

00:30:01.506 --> 00:30:04.849
shadow clear.
 The City's fiery

00:30:04.849 --> 00:30:09.740
parcels all undone,
 Already snow submerges

00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:14.560
an iron year…
O Sleepless as the river

00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:17.569
under thee,
 Vaulting the sea,

00:30:17.569 --> 00:30:21.890
the prairies' dreaming sod
[suddenly the bridge crosses

00:30:21.890 --> 00:30:25.409
the Atlantic,
it crosses the American

00:30:25.409 --> 00:30:28.178
continent],
Unto us lowliest sometime

00:30:28.178 --> 00:30:30.960
sweep, descend [and now it's
a kind of divinity

00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:35.935
that he beseeches to descend]
And of the curveship

00:30:35.935 --> 00:30:39.150
[the bridge itself seen as a
kind of vehicle of a

00:30:39.150 --> 00:30:42.050
curveship]
lend a myth to

00:30:42.050 --> 00:30:43.770
God.
 

00:30:43.770 --> 00:30:47.740
 
 

00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:59.126
The poem means to incorporate
the threat of failure and the

00:30:59.126 --> 00:31:06.390
threat of death and move beyond
it,

00:31:06.390 --> 00:31:12.861
much as it aims to incorporate
The Waste Land's despair

00:31:12.861 --> 00:31:15.089
and move beyond it.
 

00:31:15.089 --> 00:31:19.709
It is a kind of jest,
a kind of prayer,

00:31:19.709 --> 00:31:25.910
a kind of pledge that belongs
to lover or pariah;

00:31:25.910 --> 00:31:33.193
these are speech acts that are
models for the kind of poem that

00:31:33.193 --> 00:31:38.217
you're reading.
The intention is to somehow

00:31:38.217 --> 00:31:44.272
create from a series of
fragments a whole that would be

00:31:44.272 --> 00:31:49.120
an "unfractioned idiom,"
as Crane calls it,

00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:54.480
which would be a kind of pure
and redeemed language.

00:31:54.480 --> 00:32:00.869
There's that phrase in the last
stanza, "of the curveship,"

00:32:00.869 --> 00:32:05.826
meaning both derived from the
bridge, I think,

00:32:05.826 --> 00:32:08.470
and partaking of it.
 

00:32:08.470 --> 00:32:13.079
He asks the bridge to lend a
myth to God.

00:32:13.079 --> 00:32:19.000
"To lend" is to give knowing it
will be given back.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:23.647
This is not a permanent name
for God, it is not the one

00:32:23.647 --> 00:32:27.490
symbol for God.
It is only one in an ongoing

00:32:27.490 --> 00:32:32.420
series of acts of naming,
which are all acts of metaphor,

00:32:32.420 --> 00:32:36.764
which are all acts by which
something from the past is

00:32:36.764 --> 00:32:41.026
joined to the future –
something far is joined with

00:32:41.026 --> 00:32:45.534
something near – out of some
kind of spiritual need or

00:32:45.534 --> 00:32:48.735
vision.
Well, the poem was begun –

00:32:48.735 --> 00:32:53.311
Crane liked this idea – with
both ends at once just the way

00:32:53.311 --> 00:32:56.819
you build a bridge:
by writing the proem and by

00:32:56.819 --> 00:33:02.339
writing "Atlantis,"
and gradually over time moving

00:33:02.339 --> 00:33:04.799
towards the middle.
 

00:33:04.799 --> 00:33:10.809
This is the final section,
"Atlantis."

00:33:10.809 --> 00:33:13.690
In fact, why don't we turn
there for a moment.

00:33:13.690 --> 00:33:22.142
This is a splendid,
outrageous, Shelleyan lyric

00:33:22.142 --> 00:33:26.152
speech:
Through the bound cable

00:33:26.152 --> 00:33:30.022
strands, the arching path
Upward, veering with light,

00:33:30.022 --> 00:33:33.440
the flight of strings [and you
can image now in

00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:38.730
your minds that great Stella
painting over in the gallery],--

00:33:38.730 --> 00:33:43.079
Taut miles of shuttling
moonlight syncopate

00:33:43.079 --> 00:33:46.640
The whispered rush,
telepathy of wires.

00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:49.740
Up the index of night,
granite and steel--

00:33:49.740 --> 00:33:53.299
Transparent meshes--fleckless
the gleaming staves--

00:33:53.299 --> 00:33:57.460
Sibylline voices flicker,
waveringly stream

00:33:57.460 --> 00:34:02.150
As though a god were issue of
the strings….

00:34:02.150 --> 00:34:07.973
Here at the end of the poem,
Crane imagines a kind of ascent

00:34:07.973 --> 00:34:13.500
through the structure of the
bridge which becomes a grand

00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:16.559
musical instrument,
a harp.

00:34:16.559 --> 00:34:23.695
The visionary appears here in
fragmentary ways,

00:34:23.695 --> 00:34:30.210
as in line 25,
where: "Sheerly the eyes,

00:34:30.210 --> 00:34:35.130
like seagulls stung with
rime--/ slit and propelled by

00:34:35.130 --> 00:34:40.607
glistening fins of light…"
Crane talks here about the eyes

00:34:40.607 --> 00:34:46.456
moving up through this structure
like the seagull that we saw in

00:34:46.456 --> 00:34:49.519
the first line of the poem.
 

00:34:49.519 --> 00:34:55.071
The object of desire,
the version of paradise Crane

00:34:55.071 --> 00:35:01.621
offers us is there in line 42 or
so where he talks about the

00:35:01.621 --> 00:35:05.840
bridge as
"Vision-of-the-Voyage":

00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:09.473
Bridge,
lifting night to cycloramic [it

00:35:09.473 --> 00:35:10.960
should be]
crest

00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:16.440
Of deepest day--O Choir,
translating time

00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:21.130
Into what multitudinous Verb
the suns

00:35:21.130 --> 00:35:26.122
And synergy of waters ever fuse
[as if somehow the sun and water

00:35:26.122 --> 00:35:29.458
on
the space of the bridge beneath

00:35:29.458 --> 00:35:36.110
it created what Crane calls a
"multitudinous Verb"], recast

00:35:36.110 --> 00:35:39.559
In myriad syllables,--Psalm of
Cathay!

00:35:39.559 --> 00:35:44.159
[That's of course Columbus's
goal, Cathay.]

00:35:44.159 --> 00:35:47.579
O Love, thy white,
pervasive Paradigm…!

00:35:47.579 --> 00:35:51.670
[It's also a vision of
love.]

00:35:51.670 --> 00:35:56.401
Here Crane gives us a kind of
vision of the word,

00:35:56.401 --> 00:36:02.119
the "multitudinous Verb," as
what his poem draws its energy

00:36:02.119 --> 00:36:05.570
from and what it moves towards.
 

00:36:05.570 --> 00:36:11.269
It is not a Christian Word,
importantly.

00:36:11.269 --> 00:36:15.859
It is, I think,
a name for a creative process

00:36:15.859 --> 00:36:21.699
that's accessed in and through
our powers of language.

00:36:21.699 --> 00:36:27.740
"The word" in Crane's poem is
secular and historical but yet

00:36:27.740 --> 00:36:32.860
it unfolds from what he calls an
"Everpresence,"

00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:37.246
beyond time,
towards which the poem is

00:36:37.246 --> 00:36:40.542
questing.
It is a creativity,

00:36:40.542 --> 00:36:47.360
a kind of power of world-making
that's embodied in our language.

00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:52.360
Crane is imagining a
post-Christian religion for

00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:57.360
which America provides
iconography and myths.

00:36:57.360 --> 00:37:02.709
The poem is an encyclopedia of
American places and American

00:37:02.709 --> 00:37:08.243
culture – popular culture and
burlesque in "National Winter

00:37:08.243 --> 00:37:11.380
Garden,"
in "The River," in "Virginia."

00:37:11.380 --> 00:37:14.128
There's slang,
jazz, advertising,

00:37:14.128 --> 00:37:17.219
all of that,
worked into the poem.

00:37:17.219 --> 00:37:21.570
The poem combines a kind of
popular storybook history of

00:37:21.570 --> 00:37:25.920
figures like Rip Van Winkle and
the most challenging,

00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:30.480
abstract modernist poetics at
the same time.

00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:35.780
Every line is loaded with
symbols and referents linking up

00:37:35.780 --> 00:37:38.849
to other lines in the same way.
 

00:37:38.849 --> 00:37:42.035
In the same way,
Crane is suggesting that every

00:37:42.035 --> 00:37:46.467
moment in American history links
up with others and with a larger

00:37:46.467 --> 00:37:51.190
structure of action,
of which it is part.

00:37:51.190 --> 00:37:58.041
Crane's poem is therefore,
I think, at once knowingly

00:37:58.041 --> 00:38:06.210
naive and hyper-sophisticated,
both of these things at once.

00:38:06.210 --> 00:38:13.492
Crane composed the poem through
the funding, with the funding of

00:38:13.492 --> 00:38:18.809
Otto Kahn, a businessman and
philanthropist,

00:38:18.809 --> 00:38:24.849
and he explains his outline of
the poem at still a relatively

00:38:24.849 --> 00:38:30.989
early period of composition in
that letter to Otto Kahn that I

00:38:30.989 --> 00:38:34.110
included for you last time.
 

00:38:34.110 --> 00:38:39.420
Well, I'll refer to it briefly.
 

00:38:39.420 --> 00:38:46.144
Keeping in mind that table of
contents I showed you before,

00:38:46.144 --> 00:38:52.636
there's a kind of story of
American history told in large

00:38:52.636 --> 00:38:59.592
in the poem in which Crane moves
from Columbus to the section

00:38:59.592 --> 00:39:06.339
called "Powhatan's Daughter,"
where the theme is the betrayal

00:39:06.339 --> 00:39:10.329
of the land in the conquest of
the continent.

00:39:10.329 --> 00:39:15.007
In the middle,
in "Cape Hatteras," when Crane

00:39:15.007 --> 00:39:21.809
is writing about invention and
technology in American culture,

00:39:21.809 --> 00:39:26.619
his theme is also the Civil War
and World War One;

00:39:26.619 --> 00:39:31.392
again, a kind of betrayal of
vision by which technology

00:39:31.392 --> 00:39:33.690
becomes a means to kill.
 

00:39:33.690 --> 00:39:38.902
In his letter to Kahn,
he talks about having a section

00:39:38.902 --> 00:39:44.409
on John Brown that would take up
the topic of slavery.

00:39:44.409 --> 00:39:49.132
This section was never written
but there are traces of it you

00:39:49.132 --> 00:39:52.360
find in the section called "The
River."

00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:59.425
In each of these sections,
Crane turns to and looks to,

00:39:59.425 --> 00:40:04.266
again, hobos,
marginal figures who are

00:40:04.266 --> 00:40:11.004
emblems of lost promise,
who seem to represent

00:40:11.004 --> 00:40:19.494
possibilities included in but
also marginalized by American

00:40:19.494 --> 00:40:23.739
history, American culture.
 

00:40:23.739 --> 00:40:26.607
You can understand these
figures, such as the sailor that

00:40:26.607 --> 00:40:30.341
you meet in "Cutty Sark,"
as versions of the authors to

00:40:30.341 --> 00:40:35.206
whom Crane appeals throughout,
through allusion and epigraph:

00:40:35.206 --> 00:40:41.079
Melville,
Dickinson, Poe in "The Tunnel."

00:40:41.079 --> 00:40:45.515
Crane reaches back to these
authors, canonical for us,

00:40:45.515 --> 00:40:50.117
authors that you study but that
were largely left out of

00:40:50.117 --> 00:40:54.719
accounts of American literary
history in the 1920s,

00:40:54.719 --> 00:40:57.829
who themselves appeared to be
marginals.

00:40:57.829 --> 00:41:04.299
These are versions of a kind of
community that Crane wants to

00:41:04.299 --> 00:41:10.661
recover and carry forward for
the creative promise that they

00:41:10.661 --> 00:41:17.689
seem to embody.
Well, let me just point to the

00:41:17.689 --> 00:41:24.659
poem's, let's say,
two different endings.

00:41:24.659 --> 00:41:34.227
The history of the composition
of the poem is different from

00:41:34.227 --> 00:41:38.929
the sequence that you read.
 

00:41:38.929 --> 00:41:44.038
Because Crane began at both
ends, the end of the poem is

00:41:44.038 --> 00:41:47.289
really, in one sense,
the middle.

00:41:47.289 --> 00:41:51.651
When Crane completes "Cape
Hatteras," at last,

00:41:51.651 --> 00:41:57.369
after struggling with this
section for a couple of years,

00:41:57.369 --> 00:42:05.823
he completes the span of the
bridge in one particular image,

00:42:05.823 --> 00:42:13.130
and that's towards the end of
the section on 636.

00:42:13.130 --> 00:42:17.159
And he evokes and quotes
Whitman;

00:42:17.159 --> 00:42:22.957
Whitman, again,
here seen as a kind of marginal

00:42:22.957 --> 00:42:29.889
who is recovered for American
culture through the poem's

00:42:29.889 --> 00:42:34.980
imaginative act.
Whitman is addressed:

00:42:34.980 --> 00:42:38.064
Recorders ages hence
[that's a quote from Whitman's

00:42:38.064 --> 00:42:42.230
"Calamus"
poems], yes, they shall hear

00:42:42.230 --> 00:42:46.949
In their own veins uncancelled
thy sure tread [Whitman]

00:42:46.949 --> 00:42:50.176
And read thee by the aureole
[the halo]

00:42:50.176 --> 00:42:52.809
'round thy head
Of pasture-shine,

00:42:52.809 --> 00:42:54.489
Panis Angelicus!
 

00:42:54.489 --> 00:42:56.800
[Bread of angels.
 

00:42:56.800 --> 00:43:05.500
Here Whitman becomes a kind of
figure for a secular communion.]

00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:07.816
yes, Walt,
Afoot again,

00:43:07.816 --> 00:43:11.122
and onward without halt--
Not soon, nor suddenly,--no,

00:43:11.122 --> 00:43:12.530
never to let go
My hand

00:43:12.530 --> 00:43:13.840
in yours,
Walt Whitman--

00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:19.784
so--
That's a moment when in this

00:43:19.784 --> 00:43:27.635
hand clasp a certain aspiration
of the poem is completed and a

00:43:27.635 --> 00:43:34.199
connection to the past is
achieved and asserted.

00:43:34.199 --> 00:43:42.879
The conclusion of the poem that
we find at the end of "Atlantis"

00:43:42.879 --> 00:43:49.630
is another vision,
and I'll conclude with that.

00:43:49.630 --> 00:43:54.683
It's, I think,
something to be contrasted with

00:43:54.683 --> 00:44:01.534
this triumphant and reassuring
conclusion that "Cape Hatteras"

00:44:01.534 --> 00:44:08.367
offers.
Here are the last two sublime

00:44:08.367 --> 00:44:12.420
stanzas of the poem.
 

00:44:12.420 --> 00:44:15.030
Migrations that must
needs void memory,

00:44:15.030 --> 00:44:17.610
Inventions that cobblestone the
heart,--

00:44:17.610 --> 00:44:21.190
Unspeakable Thou Bridge to
Thee, O Love.

00:44:21.190 --> 00:44:25.280
Thy pardon for this history,
whitest Flower,

00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:31.569
O Answerer of all,--Anemone,--
Now while thy petals spend the

00:44:31.569 --> 00:44:33.380
suns about us,
hold--

00:44:33.380 --> 00:44:36.900
(O Thou whose radiance doth
inherit me)

00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:40.150
Atlantis,--hold thy floating
singer late!

00:44:40.150 --> 00:44:46.059
Here, Atlantis is brought into
being with the singer himself on

00:44:46.059 --> 00:44:50.539
the verge of drowning,
"thy floating singer."

00:44:50.539 --> 00:44:56.753
And then finally Crane
dedicates himself to this vision

00:44:56.753 --> 00:45:02.402
which he calls "Everpresence":
So to thine Everpresence,

00:45:02.402 --> 00:45:06.131
beyond time,
Like spears ensanguined of one

00:45:06.131 --> 00:45:09.699
tolling star
That bleeds infinity--the

00:45:09.699 --> 00:45:13.820
orphic strings [now the cables
of the bridge

00:45:13.820 --> 00:45:17.369
have become the strings of
Orpheus's lyre],

00:45:17.369 --> 00:45:20.131
Sidereal phalanxes,
leap and converge [and again

00:45:20.131 --> 00:45:23.758
you can see the
structure of the bridge imaged

00:45:23.758 --> 00:45:26.960
there]:
-- One Song, one Bridge of Fire!

00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:31.325
Is it Cathay,
Now pity steeps the grass and

00:45:31.325 --> 00:45:34.463
rainbows ring
The serpent with the eagles in

00:45:34.463 --> 00:45:38.486
the leaves…?
Whispers antiphonal in azure

00:45:38.486 --> 00:45:42.834
swing.
The poem ends with this

00:45:42.834 --> 00:45:46.219
question, "Is it Cathay?"
 

00:45:46.219 --> 00:45:52.119
Columbus's question:
an error, a mistake.

00:45:52.119 --> 00:45:57.818
It is the nature of the object
of desire to be misnamed,

00:45:57.818 --> 00:46:01.860
precisely because it has no one
name.

00:46:01.860 --> 00:46:06.383
And even in this error,
this kind of defeat,

00:46:06.383 --> 00:46:12.380
there is for Crane an affirming
of the scope of desire,

00:46:12.380 --> 00:46:16.827
precisely through its failure
to be contained by a single

00:46:16.827 --> 00:46:21.039
reference.
Well, we'll stop now.

00:46:21.039 --> 00:46:28.909
And I know you have done your
work and gathered a note.

00:46:28.909 --> 00:46:34.626
We'll collect these and put
together our own annotated

00:46:34.626 --> 00:46:37.000
version of the poem.

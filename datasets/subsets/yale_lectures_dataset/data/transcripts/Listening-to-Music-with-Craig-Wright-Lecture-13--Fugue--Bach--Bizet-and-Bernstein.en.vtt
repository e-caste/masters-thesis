00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:04.635
Prof: Let us begin then
with the subject of today,

00:00:04.635 --> 00:00:05.830
which is the fugue.
 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:10.150
Every educated person should
know what a fugue is.

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:10.680
Why?
 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:15.981
Because it's an intellectual
model, an intellectual paradigm

00:00:15.981 --> 00:00:20.743
that surfaces in a number of
disciplines--for example,

00:00:20.743 --> 00:00:22.630
in poetry, oddly.
 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.898
If you've ever peeked at
Thomas--T.S. Eliot's "The

00:00:26.898 --> 00:00:30.772
Four Quartets,"
the structure of the fugue is

00:00:30.772 --> 00:00:33.460
referenced there frequently.
 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.082
We could go to literature--a
novel written about the same

00:00:36.082 --> 00:00:38.470
time, Aldous Huxley's Point
Counter Point.

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.960
It's framed in the shape of a
fugue.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.340
We could go to geology.
 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.789
Geologists occasionally will
say, "This particular

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.920
crystal has a fugue-like
structure to it."

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.038
Turning to painting,
there are painters of the

00:00:53.038 --> 00:00:53.980
twentieth century.
 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.629
I can name at least three,
Franz Kupka,

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:58.790
Henry Valensi,
and Josef Albers,

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.695
who used to be the dean of our
own Yale School of Art and

00:01:02.695 --> 00:01:04.019
Architecture.
 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.326
They all painted fugues and we
will be looking at Alber's

00:01:08.326 --> 00:01:10.504
fugue--
which actually happens to be in

00:01:10.504 --> 00:01:12.831
your textbook--
when we come to section this

00:01:12.831 --> 00:01:16.180
week, so be sure to bring your
textbooks to section this week

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.110
'cause we'll--
we will be using them.

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.552
I'm interested in the fugue
also because of this book,

00:01:23.552 --> 00:01:26.540
Douglas Hofstadter's Godel,
Escher, Bach.

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.390
Oh, my. That's heavy.
 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.188
My--mine--I didn't bring in my
copy.

00:01:30.188 --> 00:01:32.638
This is the Bass copy that
Lynda was kind enough to pull

00:01:32.638 --> 00:01:32.950
over.
 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.430
Mine is a paperback.
 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.933
It's not this heavy,
but in a way this is

00:01:36.933 --> 00:01:39.500
indicative, because it's heavy
reading.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.480
Anybody ever peeked at this
book and any other--good.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:43.660
Is it Adam?
 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:44.090
Student: Yeah.
 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:45.101
Prof: Yeah.
 

00:01:45.101 --> 00:01:47.349
Adam, what course did you read
this in?

00:01:47.349 --> 00:01:49.560
Student: It was
recommended by a friend.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.780
Prof: Recommended by a
friend.

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.135
I can follow about the first
twenty-five or thirty pages or

00:01:53.135 --> 00:01:53.340
so.
 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.940
Then when it gets to the math
it really gets over my head,

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.811
but what it is is an attempt to
use the fugue as a way of

00:02:00.811 --> 00:02:04.408
bringing a common mode of
understanding to the visual

00:02:04.408 --> 00:02:07.129
arts,
to mathematics and to music.

00:02:07.129 --> 00:02:10.107
The musician that is
foregrounded here,

00:02:10.107 --> 00:02:14.258
of course, is J.S. Bach,
the master of the fugue.

00:02:14.258 --> 00:02:16.760
So we want to know about how
fugues operate,

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.378
so let's take a look at the
specifics here.

00:02:19.378 --> 00:02:22.325
The term "fugue"
actually comes from an old

00:02:22.325 --> 00:02:24.147
Latin word,
"fuga,"

00:02:24.147 --> 00:02:27.293
which means "flight"
or "to fly,"

00:02:27.293 --> 00:02:30.680
so in a fugue what you get is
one voice going ahead,

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.758
leading ahead,
and another voice following it.

00:02:33.758 --> 00:02:36.009
Now I just used the term
"voice"

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:36.449
there.
 

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:41.395
Fugues can be written for
actual voices sounding voices or

00:02:41.395 --> 00:02:45.992
they can be written for
instruments such as the violin

00:02:45.992 --> 00:02:49.030
or the cello--individual lines.
 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.995
They can even be written for
instruments that can play

00:02:51.995 --> 00:02:54.289
several lines or several parts
at once.

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:55.110
The piano can do that.
 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.060
The organ can do that.
 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.538
Even the guitar and
occasionally the violin will be

00:02:58.538 --> 00:02:59.479
asked to do that.
 

00:02:59.479 --> 00:03:04.919
Fugues have been written for as
few as two voices.

00:03:04.919 --> 00:03:06.968
Yes, you could have a two-voice
fugue--

00:03:06.968 --> 00:03:10.288
up to as many as thirty-two
voices--

00:03:10.288 --> 00:03:16.103
and they can be,
as mentioned,

00:03:16.103 --> 00:03:20.485
written for--
and they are best,

00:03:20.485 --> 00:03:24.276
perhaps, performed on--
these keyboard instruments that

00:03:24.276 --> 00:03:26.740
have the capacity to play many
lines,

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:28.620
many parts, many voices at once.
 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.770
The greatest collection of
fugues,

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:35.032
that you may have bumped into,
heard about or at least heard

00:03:35.032 --> 00:03:37.348
the term,
is this collection of preludes

00:03:37.348 --> 00:03:39.911
and fugues by J.S. Bach called
"The Well-Tempered

00:03:39.911 --> 00:03:40.830
Clavier."
 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:42.120
First of all, what's a prelude?
 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:47.259
It's just a warm-up piece,
&gt;

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:49.340
to just sort of get relaxed.
 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.548
You get to see your fingers,
get a feel of the keyboard or

00:03:51.548 --> 00:03:53.027
the--
of the lute or whatever it

00:03:53.027 --> 00:03:55.899
might happen to may be--
a prelude, a pre play,

00:03:55.899 --> 00:04:00.250
a warm-up, and then we go on to
the meat of the issue,

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.408
which is the fugue.
 

00:04:02.408 --> 00:04:05.471
Now why is this called
"The Well-Tempered

00:04:05.471 --> 00:04:06.560
Clavier"?
 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:07.580
Anybody know?
 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:09.430
Anybody have--that's an odd
term.

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:10.488
"Clavier"
just means

00:04:10.488 --> 00:04:11.766
"keyboard,"
the well-tuned

00:04:11.766 --> 00:04:12.680
"keyboard."
 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.840
Thoughts there?
 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.690
Well, what was going on in
Bach's day is that they didn't

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.339
have a keyboard that--
&gt;

00:04:20.339 --> 00:04:23.466
they didn't have a tuning
system in which all of the

00:04:23.466 --> 00:04:25.980
pitches were exactly a half step
apart.

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:27.800
Some were slightly
&gt;

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.699
closer together,
and then others farther apart.

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:32.519
And the key of &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:04:32.519 --> 00:04:35.199
C actually had a slightly
different sound than the key of

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:36.730
D, &gt;
 

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:40.430
and it's only in the eighteenth
and nineteenth century that we

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.766
gradually shifted from an
unequal keyboard to an equally

00:04:43.766 --> 00:04:44.920
tuned keyboard.
 

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:49.576
So Bach is kind of part of this
transition to the equal-tuned

00:04:49.576 --> 00:04:50.430
keyboard.
 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:54.461
He was getting close to the
equal temperament of the modern

00:04:54.461 --> 00:04:57.935
keyboard and that's why he
called it the well-tuned

00:04:57.935 --> 00:05:01.310
keyboard,
and it--by tuning it this way,

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:04.509
it allows you to modulate to
all keys,

00:05:04.509 --> 00:05:06.079
and that's what he did in this
collection.

00:05:06.079 --> 00:05:09.882
He wrote a--two books,
one in seventeen- about 1722,

00:05:09.882 --> 00:05:13.536
when he was in CÃ¶then and
another about 1742,

00:05:13.536 --> 00:05:15.550
when he was in Leipzig.
 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:19.113
And in each of these books we
have a total of twenty-four

00:05:19.113 --> 00:05:22.360
preludes and fugues:
one, the prelude and fugue in C

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.778
major, &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:05:24.778 --> 00:05:26.793
one prelude and fugue in C
minor, &lt;&lt;plays

00:05:26.793 --> 00:05:27.449
piano&gt;&gt;
 

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:29.939
one prelude and fugue in
C-sharp major,

00:05:29.939 --> 00:05:31.839
&gt;
 

00:05:31.839 --> 00:05:33.937
and one prelude and fugue in
C-sharp minor &lt;&lt;plays

00:05:33.937 --> 00:05:34.509
piano&gt;&gt;
 

00:05:34.509 --> 00:05:36.781
and so on it goes,
all the way up the keyboard in

00:05:36.781 --> 00:05:38.440
that fashion--two books of
those.

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:41.346
And this is kind of standard
fodder for those that want to

00:05:41.346 --> 00:05:42.980
become professional musicians.
 

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:43.552
Okay.
 

00:05:43.552 --> 00:05:49.511
So that's what that is about,
"The Well-Tempered

00:05:49.511 --> 00:05:51.459
Clavier."
 

00:05:51.459 --> 00:05:54.627
We've been referencing Bach
here and nobody,

00:05:54.627 --> 00:05:58.310
of course, wrote better fugues
than J.S. Bach.

00:05:58.310 --> 00:05:59.670
Some continued.
 

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:02.100
Some continued to write fugues.
 

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:04.220
Mozart wrote some fugues,
Haydn wrote some fugues,

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:06.088
Beethoven wrote some fugues and
so on,

00:06:06.088 --> 00:06:09.690
and even into the twentieth
century we have a few composers:

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:12.007
Paul Hindemith,
used to teach at Yale,

00:06:12.007 --> 00:06:13.170
Dmitri Shostakovich.
 

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:16.180
They wrote fugues,
but generally speaking the

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:19.329
fugue has its heyday in the
Baroque period,

00:06:19.329 --> 00:06:22.939
roughly sixteen hundred to
seventeen fifty,

00:06:22.939 --> 00:06:25.569
the heyday of Bach and Handel.
 

00:06:25.569 --> 00:06:27.420
How do fugues work?
 

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:31.024
Well, they start out--as
mentioned--with one voice

00:06:31.024 --> 00:06:35.216
leading forward and then another
voice imitates that voice

00:06:35.216 --> 00:06:36.100
exactly.
 

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:38.790
Now if that following
voice--here's a question.

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:42.060
If that following voice
imitated the leader exactly from

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:44.379
beginning to end,
what would we have?

00:06:44.379 --> 00:06:47.269
Hm?
 

00:06:47.269 --> 00:06:48.600
Student: A round.
 

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:50.240
Prof: A round.
 

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:50.632
Okay.
 

00:06:50.632 --> 00:06:51.180
Good.
 

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:52.540
That's what we would have,
a round.

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:55.379
Or we could call--use the
fancier music word,

00:06:55.379 --> 00:06:56.800
a "canon."
 

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.589
Canon, round--the same thing,
one voice imitating the other

00:06:59.589 --> 00:07:01.129
exactly from beginning to end.
 

00:07:01.129 --> 00:07:05.300
But in a fugue what happens is
after the main idea--

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:07.009
which we'll be calling the
"subject"--

00:07:07.009 --> 00:07:10.738
the main idea is stated,
then the parts go their

00:07:10.738 --> 00:07:14.230
independent ways generating
counterpoint,

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:18.031
but they're not exact;
they're not precise

00:07:18.031 --> 00:07:21.889
duplications of the rhythms and
the pitches of the leaders.

00:07:21.889 --> 00:07:26.045
So what we could do would be to
visualize this in a sort of

00:07:26.045 --> 00:07:27.480
crude way up here.
 

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:29.980
We have a leader and then a
follower.

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:33.033
And the follower duplicates the
main idea, which we're going to

00:07:33.033 --> 00:07:34.904
call the subject,
for a period of time,

00:07:34.904 --> 00:07:36.629
but then it kind of breaks off.
 

00:07:36.629 --> 00:07:40.105
So voices will come in and
duplicate a certain amount of

00:07:40.105 --> 00:07:43.329
material and then break off and
go their own way.

00:07:43.329 --> 00:07:46.803
So that's a good way of
thinking of the beginning of a

00:07:46.803 --> 00:07:50.410
fugue, which we will call the
"exposition."

00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:52.279
I'll come back to that point in
a moment.

00:07:52.279 --> 00:07:54.771
Notice here I've put a
little--silly little tree up

00:07:54.771 --> 00:07:55.120
here.
 

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:58.389
We could say that we have the
genus polyphony here and we've

00:07:58.389 --> 00:08:00.884
got monophonic texture,
homophonic texture and

00:08:00.884 --> 00:08:02.160
polyphonic texture.
 

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:06.562
So within polyphonic texture we
have non-imitative texture and

00:08:06.562 --> 00:08:10.675
then a stream of imitative
polyphony and then two forms of

00:08:10.675 --> 00:08:13.887
imitative polyphony,
rather strict--exactly

00:08:13.887 --> 00:08:17.413
strict--imitative polyphony,
the canon, and less strict

00:08:17.413 --> 00:08:19.800
imitative polyphony--
the fugue.

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:20.425
Okay?
 

00:08:20.425 --> 00:08:24.050
Questions about that so far?
 

00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:24.654
All right.
 

00:08:24.654 --> 00:08:27.379
Let's go back to the beginning
of the fugue.

00:08:27.379 --> 00:08:30.302
We have this opening melody,
the distinctive part of it,

00:08:30.302 --> 00:08:32.428
which we're going to call the
subject.

00:08:32.428 --> 00:08:34.615
That's just what we call the
melody in a fugue,

00:08:34.615 --> 00:08:35.279
the subject.
 

00:08:35.279 --> 00:08:39.730
And the way this works is in a
fugue each of the voices in turn

00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:42.100
will come in with that subject.
 

00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:44.504
One will start out,
then another will come in,

00:08:44.504 --> 00:08:46.000
then another will come in.
 

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.871
After all of the voices are in,
we're at the end of what we

00:08:49.871 --> 00:08:52.210
call the exposition of the
fugue.

00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:54.602
Now we have had the term
"exposition"

00:08:54.602 --> 00:08:56.058
before and where was that?
 

00:08:56.058 --> 00:08:57.210
Student:
&gt;

00:08:57.210 --> 00:08:59.792
Prof: Over there,
Elizabeth.

00:08:59.792 --> 00:09:00.779
I hear you.
 

00:09:00.779 --> 00:09:01.720
Student: --sonata form?
 

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:03.423
Prof: Yeah,
sonata form,

00:09:03.423 --> 00:09:06.206
sonata-allegro form,
so we--and what do we mean by

00:09:06.206 --> 00:09:08.080
"exposition"
there?

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:10.241
Well, it's a chance where you
present all of the--all the

00:09:10.241 --> 00:09:12.327
themes, and we talked about
first theme and then second

00:09:12.327 --> 00:09:13.408
theme and closing theme.
 

00:09:13.408 --> 00:09:16.774
Well, here in a fugue we have
just one theme but everybody's

00:09:16.774 --> 00:09:19.000
going to get a chance to present
it,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.798
and after everyone has a chance
to present it--

00:09:20.798 --> 00:09:22.408
every voice has a chance to
present it--

00:09:22.408 --> 00:09:25.000
then we're finished with the
exposition;

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.389
all the voices have exposed the
theme in their range.

00:09:28.389 --> 00:09:32.115
After that we go to what's
called the "episode"

00:09:32.115 --> 00:09:32.980
of a fugue.
 

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:34.538
What happens in an episode?
 

00:09:34.538 --> 00:09:38.283
Well, usually it modulates key
and the vehicle through

00:09:38.283 --> 00:09:41.745
composers frequently modulate is
melodic sequence,

00:09:41.745 --> 00:09:43.298
either up or down.
 

00:09:43.298 --> 00:09:45.798
You can kind of move around by
using sequence.

00:09:45.798 --> 00:09:48.200
You can get to different places
by using sequence.

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:52.517
So it tends to be contrapuntal
because it's using little

00:09:52.517 --> 00:09:54.480
motives from the theme.
 

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:56.143
It modulates,
moves around a lot,

00:09:56.143 --> 00:09:58.690
goes to different keys,
sounds a bit unsettled.

00:09:58.690 --> 00:10:02.996
If you were to think back on
sonata-allegro form and try to

00:10:02.996 --> 00:10:06.711
find an analog for
sonata-allegro form in the fugue

00:10:06.711 --> 00:10:08.940
episode, what would it be?
 

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:12.789
What is the episode of the
fugue like in sonata-allegro

00:10:12.789 --> 00:10:13.289
form?
 

00:10:13.289 --> 00:10:14.059
Roger.
 

00:10:14.059 --> 00:10:14.950
Student: The development?
 

00:10:14.950 --> 00:10:16.960
Prof: Exactly--the
development section.

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:20.221
So these episodes in a fugue
are sort of mini development

00:10:20.221 --> 00:10:22.615
sections,
so visualize if you will--we've

00:10:22.615 --> 00:10:24.750
started out here with the
exposition,

00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:27.220
in which all voices present the
subject.

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:30.549
Then you have this kind of free
period in which the motive out

00:10:30.549 --> 00:10:33.498
of the subject is played with,
developed, moved around,

00:10:33.498 --> 00:10:34.700
different pitches.
 

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:38.113
Then the subject will come back
in a new key because we've

00:10:38.113 --> 00:10:41.775
modulated in the episode,
subject in just one voice,

00:10:41.775 --> 00:10:43.984
new key,
then another episode in which

00:10:43.984 --> 00:10:46.099
there's modulation,
more counterpoint,

00:10:46.099 --> 00:10:48.491
more movement;
another statement of the

00:10:48.491 --> 00:10:51.788
subject in a new key;
another episode;

00:10:51.788 --> 00:10:54.330
another statement of the
subject, and on it goes until--

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:56.750
oh, we run out of energy
usually about--

00:10:56.750 --> 00:11:00.264
after four or five minutes or
so, at which point the composer

00:11:00.264 --> 00:11:03.912
will bring the subject back--
maybe in the bass or in the

00:11:03.912 --> 00:11:07.509
soprano in a very prominent
range in the tonic key--

00:11:07.509 --> 00:11:08.580
and we have the sense,
"oh,

00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:12.620
this is a very solid moment;
yes, this fugue is ending."

00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:15.768
And maybe they'll throw upon
one or--throw one or two chords

00:11:15.768 --> 00:11:17.210
on the end but that's it.
 

00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:21.788
So it's a complex form,
but maybe not quite as complex

00:11:21.788 --> 00:11:23.950
as sonata-allegro form.
 

00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:26.590
What's a definition then?
 

00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:29.750
If you're taking notes there,
what's a definition of a fugue?

00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:33.020
Well, I wrote a definition of a
fugue and I will read the

00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:34.950
definition out of the textbook.
 

00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:37.667
Students don't like this,
I've found, if you read out of

00:11:37.667 --> 00:11:38.308
a textbook.
 

00:11:38.308 --> 00:11:42.053
But I ought to be able to do
this since I wrote the textbook.

00:11:42.053 --> 00:11:42.490
Okay?
 

00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:45.950
So I'm going to read a good
definition of a fugue here.

00:11:45.950 --> 00:11:50.418
Definition of the fugue:
A composition for two,

00:11:50.418 --> 00:11:55.139
three or four parts played or
sung by voices or instruments

00:11:55.139 --> 00:12:00.019
which begins with a presentation
of a subject in imitation in

00:12:00.019 --> 00:12:01.159
each part.
 

00:12:01.159 --> 00:12:02.278
The episode--excuse me.
 

00:12:02.278 --> 00:12:05.990
The exposition continues with
modulating passages of free

00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:08.706
counterpoint--
the episodes--and further

00:12:08.706 --> 00:12:12.013
appearances of the subject,
and ends with a strong

00:12:12.013 --> 00:12:13.899
affirmation of the tonic key.
 

00:12:13.899 --> 00:12:17.657
Well, you can't write all that
down, but if you want to just

00:12:17.657 --> 00:12:20.331
put in your notes:
For definition of fugue,

00:12:20.331 --> 00:12:22.178
see page 144 of the text.
 

00:12:22.178 --> 00:12:26.414
Fortunately,
as I say, it's easier to hear

00:12:26.414 --> 00:12:31.269
and look at fugues than it is to
define them.

00:12:31.269 --> 00:12:31.841
All right.
 

00:12:31.841 --> 00:12:34.649
Now today we're going to do
something different.

00:12:34.649 --> 00:12:37.796
It's the only day in our course
where we're actually going to

00:12:37.796 --> 00:12:38.529
look at music.
 

00:12:38.529 --> 00:12:38.950
Okay?
 

00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:42.186
We've handed out music for
you--an entire piece,

00:12:42.186 --> 00:12:45.352
an entire fugue by J.S. Bach
here, and ideally,

00:12:45.352 --> 00:12:49.484
I guess, we'd be in a seminar
format and we'd all be standing

00:12:49.484 --> 00:12:51.548
around the piano here.
 

00:12:51.548 --> 00:12:57.356
So my first question for you is
for how many voices is this

00:12:57.356 --> 00:12:58.960
fugue written?
 

00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:05.360
Look at just the first page and
look vertically and see what's

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:11.760
the maximum number of pitches
you have sounding simultaneously

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:14.070
at any one moment.
 

00:13:14.070 --> 00:13:20.750
Caroline, is it?
 

00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:21.649
Student: Three?
 

00:13:21.649 --> 00:13:22.669
Prof: Three. Okay?
 

00:13:22.669 --> 00:13:23.798
Yeah, we have three.
 

00:13:23.798 --> 00:13:26.172
If you look through,
there are--sometimes at the

00:13:26.172 --> 00:13:29.150
very beginning there's just one
voice and then there are two

00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:31.070
voices and then the three
voices,

00:13:31.070 --> 00:13:32.668
three lines.
 

00:13:32.668 --> 00:13:35.870
But it never gets to be more
than three lines.

00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:40.524
So we have our exposition here
and it consists of three

00:13:40.524 --> 00:13:42.940
statements of the subject.
 

00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:46.173
We're going to call these three
voices, or lines,

00:13:46.173 --> 00:13:48.798
the alto, &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:13:48.798 --> 00:13:50.840
the soprano,
&gt;

00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:54.070
and the bass,
&gt;

00:13:54.070 --> 00:13:56.769
which comes in in bar seven
there.

00:13:56.769 --> 00:13:58.570
So here's a little bit of the
beginning of this.

00:13:58.570 --> 00:14:25.120
&gt;
 

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:25.538
Okay.
 

00:14:25.538 --> 00:14:29.903
So that's our exposition,
because each of the voices,

00:14:29.903 --> 00:14:34.268
alto, soprano and bass,
has come in and presented the

00:14:34.268 --> 00:14:35.360
subject.
 

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:38.110
Now we have bars nine and ten
here.

00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:45.320
&gt;
 

00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:56.399
What's that if I just go
&gt;?

00:14:56.399 --> 00:14:57.830
Jerry, what's that?
 

00:14:57.830 --> 00:14:58.070
Student:
&gt;

00:14:58.070 --> 00:15:01.044
Prof: It's a melodic
sequence, and which direction is

00:15:01.044 --> 00:15:01.600
it going?
 

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:02.418
Up or down?
 

00:15:02.418 --> 00:15:06.669
Well, that's maybe harder than
you think.

00:15:06.669 --> 00:15:15.028
&gt;
 

00:15:15.028 --> 00:15:18.581
Generally going down,
not because the line is going

00:15:18.581 --> 00:15:22.418
down, but we're starting
&gt;

00:15:22.418 --> 00:15:27.864
each time on a successively
lower pitch, and this sequence

00:15:27.864 --> 00:15:31.590
takes us &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;.

00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:36.871
So we've started in this kind
of tonality &lt;&lt;plays

00:15:36.871 --> 00:15:38.340
piano&gt;&gt;
 

00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:41.514
which is minor,
but now by the time we've

00:15:41.514 --> 00:15:45.799
gotten to bar ten and eleven
particularly &lt;&lt;plays

00:15:45.799 --> 00:15:47.149
piano&gt;&gt;
 

00:15:47.149 --> 00:15:48.970
he's modulated.
 

00:15:48.970 --> 00:15:52.740
So that's what our little
episode was in bars nine and ten

00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:53.269
there.
 

00:15:53.269 --> 00:15:56.480
It allowed us to move from a
minor key to a major key.

00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:59.875
And now the subject comes back
in and, as you can see,

00:15:59.875 --> 00:16:01.668
what voice is it in there?
 

00:16:01.668 --> 00:16:07.110
What voice is the subject in
bar eleven?

00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:08.190
Pretty straightforward.
 

00:16:08.190 --> 00:16:10.289
Somebody yell it out.
 

00:16:10.289 --> 00:16:10.970
Student: Soprano.
 

00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:11.951
Prof: Soprano.
 

00:16:11.951 --> 00:16:13.820
Okay, so here--heads up on the
soprano.

00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:21.350
&gt;
 

00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:24.926
So there we are,
a nice statement of the theme

00:16:24.926 --> 00:16:27.309
in the major in the soprano.
 

00:16:27.309 --> 00:16:34.840
&gt;
 

00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:37.678
What happened in that little
episode?

00:16:37.678 --> 00:16:40.168
We were here &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:16:40.168 --> 00:16:42.509
and now we're here,
&gt;

00:16:42.509 --> 00:16:48.467
modulated again to minor,
and there in bar fifteen,

00:16:48.467 --> 00:16:51.210
where is the subject?
 

00:16:51.210 --> 00:17:00.769
&gt;
 

00:17:00.769 --> 00:17:02.710
Which bar?
 

00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:04.569
Chris.
 

00:17:04.569 --> 00:17:05.098
Student: Alto?
 

00:17:05.098 --> 00:17:05.920
Prof: Alto part.
 

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:06.097
Good.
 

00:17:06.097 --> 00:17:06.420
Thanks.
 

00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:07.730
So there it is in the alto part.
 

00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:10.682
That's an interesting moment
there because we've got a

00:17:10.682 --> 00:17:13.191
three-voice fugue,
and how many hands does the

00:17:13.191 --> 00:17:14.250
performer have?
 

00:17:14.250 --> 00:17:16.838
Obviously two,
so at some moments these hands

00:17:16.838 --> 00:17:20.369
are going to have to share a
subject, and that's what happens

00:17:20.369 --> 00:17:21.430
in that voice.
 

00:17:21.430 --> 00:17:24.713
When you play this--take a look
there, the very last measure of

00:17:24.713 --> 00:17:25.348
that page.
 

00:17:25.348 --> 00:17:26.045
It must be fifteen.
 

00:17:26.045 --> 00:17:27.068
&gt;
 

00:17:27.068 --> 00:17:32.054
It starts out--my left hand is
playing here &lt;&lt;plays

00:17:32.054 --> 00:17:33.390
piano&gt;&gt;
 

00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:36.277
and then the left hand has to
go down and pick up the

00:17:36.277 --> 00:17:39.498
counterpoint in the bass and the
right hand takes over that

00:17:39.498 --> 00:17:49.410
subject,
&gt;

00:17:49.410 --> 00:17:53.250
but it's the job of the pianist
there who--

00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:54.858
or the keyboardist,
whoever is playing it--

00:17:54.858 --> 00:17:58.122
to really lean on the inside of
your hand there because when

00:17:58.122 --> 00:18:00.390
you'd normally play these
instruments,

00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:02.509
there's a tendency--and I'm
sure Santana,

00:18:02.509 --> 00:18:04.210
who is a far better keyboardist
than I,

00:18:04.210 --> 00:18:07.308
will confirm this--there's a
tendency to roll to either side.

00:18:07.308 --> 00:18:09.028
It's easier to play bass and
soprano.

00:18:09.028 --> 00:18:12.605
What's hard to do is to get
those inner voices so the

00:18:12.605 --> 00:18:16.180
keyboard player has to
&gt;

00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:26.450
and then &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:18:26.450 --> 00:18:27.798
so you can really hear that.
 

00:18:27.798 --> 00:18:29.972
If you didn't hear it,
then that wasn't a good

00:18:29.972 --> 00:18:30.650
performance.
 

00:18:30.650 --> 00:18:31.464
All right.
 

00:18:31.464 --> 00:18:34.808
Now that takes us across the
page there.

00:18:34.808 --> 00:18:36.269
We're now back in &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:18:36.269 --> 00:18:37.868
a minor key.
 

00:18:37.868 --> 00:18:40.673
This is bar sixteen and
seventeen, and in bars

00:18:40.673 --> 00:18:43.541
seventeen, eighteen,
nineteen, the beginning of

00:18:43.541 --> 00:18:46.160
twenty, we have an interesting
moment.

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:48.569
It's called invertible
counterpoint.

00:18:48.569 --> 00:18:50.009
What do we mean by that?
 

00:18:50.009 --> 00:18:57.568
Well, he has a motive
&gt;

00:18:57.568 --> 00:19:00.362
and we're going to call that
motive A, and he has another

00:19:00.362 --> 00:19:01.309
motive, motive B.
 

00:19:01.309 --> 00:19:05.440
&gt;
 

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:09.653
So there is B in the alto,
A in the bass,

00:19:09.653 --> 00:19:13.972
and together they sound sort of
like this.

00:19:13.972 --> 00:19:17.240
&gt;
 

00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:18.549
Okay? Cool.
 

00:19:18.549 --> 00:19:20.819
Now the next three bars.
 

00:19:20.819 --> 00:19:21.730
What happens?
 

00:19:21.730 --> 00:19:27.160
Well, he takes B &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:31.420
and so he takes B and puts that
below A.

00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:33.269
He's switching the positions
here.

00:19:33.269 --> 00:19:38.180
A is now &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;.

00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:41.390
Both of these motives are
coming up in rising sequence.

00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:44.428
So let's go back to the
beginning of seventeen there and

00:19:44.428 --> 00:19:46.029
we'll listen to the switch.
 

00:19:46.029 --> 00:19:59.230
&gt;
 

00:19:59.230 --> 00:20:00.548
All right.
 

00:20:00.548 --> 00:20:03.305
So that goes by very quickly.
 

00:20:03.305 --> 00:20:03.970
Right?
 

00:20:03.970 --> 00:20:07.009
How long do you think it took
Bach to figure that out?

00:20:07.009 --> 00:20:07.826
I don't know.
 

00:20:07.826 --> 00:20:09.836
He's a very good
contrapuntalist,

00:20:09.836 --> 00:20:12.160
maybe "boom,"
like that.

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:15.128
I'd have to sit there--Santana,
how long would it take you to

00:20:15.128 --> 00:20:17.751
figure out some invertible
counterpoint that you could

00:20:17.751 --> 00:20:20.155
think of one melody,
think up another melody that

00:20:20.155 --> 00:20:23.116
would be a harmony against it,
but yet you could flip the two

00:20:23.116 --> 00:20:25.450
and it would still sound pretty
darn good?

00:20:25.450 --> 00:20:27.759
It'd take a long time to kind
of work that out.

00:20:27.759 --> 00:20:29.880
So that's what's kind of neat
about fugue.

00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:33.227
There's all these intricacies
embedded in them that almost

00:20:33.227 --> 00:20:36.517
sail by the general listener
unless we happen to have the

00:20:36.517 --> 00:20:39.630
music right in front of us and
can dwell on them.

00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:40.214
All right.
 

00:20:40.214 --> 00:20:43.554
So that takes us over now to
bar twenty, where we are here

00:20:43.554 --> 00:20:46.190
back, I guess,
&gt;

00:20:46.190 --> 00:21:10.358
in our tonic key of C minor,
and the theme is up in the

00:21:10.358 --> 00:21:26.920
soprano &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:38.009
and then one final statement in
the soprano &lt;&lt;plays

00:21:38.009 --> 00:21:40.980
piano&gt;&gt;
 

00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:43.068
--a couple of interesting
points there.

00:21:43.068 --> 00:21:51.817
When we concluded this piece we
had this sound &lt;&lt;plays

00:21:51.817 --> 00:21:54.190
piano&gt;&gt;.
 

00:21:54.190 --> 00:21:56.798
What's a little bit surprising
about that?

00:21:56.798 --> 00:22:03.210
We're ending a piece that's
called the Fugue Number Two in C

00:22:03.210 --> 00:22:04.078
Minor.
 

00:22:04.078 --> 00:22:09.250
We are ending here with
&gt;.

00:22:09.250 --> 00:22:10.349
Does that sound like a minor
chord again?

00:22:10.349 --> 00:22:12.019
No, no. A major chord.
 

00:22:12.019 --> 00:22:13.538
All right. So he's changed it.
 

00:22:13.538 --> 00:22:16.265
This is a standard
gamut--gambit from the late

00:22:16.265 --> 00:22:20.019
sixteenth right through the
eighteenth century-- last chord.

00:22:20.019 --> 00:22:21.670
They didn't like to end pieces
in minor.

00:22:21.670 --> 00:22:22.930
Maybe it was too depressing or
whatever.

00:22:22.930 --> 00:22:25.470
&gt;
 

00:22:25.470 --> 00:22:30.451
Oh, don't want to do that,
so &gt;

00:22:30.451 --> 00:22:33.338
&gt;
 

00:22:33.338 --> 00:22:36.130
with the major third up there
above.

00:22:36.130 --> 00:22:38.798
That's called the Picardy
third, maybe from the Old French

00:22:38.798 --> 00:22:40.998
word picart,
which means sort of sharp or

00:22:40.998 --> 00:22:41.558
pointed.
 

00:22:41.558 --> 00:22:43.319
So we have a pointed ending
there.

00:22:43.319 --> 00:22:44.298
We have a major ending.
 

00:22:44.298 --> 00:22:47.766
Here's another issue when
we're--since we're on the topic

00:22:47.766 --> 00:22:50.490
of points and that's called a
pedal point.

00:22:50.490 --> 00:22:54.500
What was J.S. Bach known as
in his day?

00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:55.849
Was he known as a great
composer?

00:22:55.849 --> 00:22:58.009
What was he known as?
 

00:22:58.009 --> 00:23:00.049
How did he earn--basically,
how did he earn his living?

00:23:00.049 --> 00:23:02.587
Student: He played--
Prof: He played

00:23:02.587 --> 00:23:04.596
the--you're getting warm.
 

00:23:04.596 --> 00:23:05.160
Yeah?
 

00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:05.690
Student: Is it organ?
 

00:23:05.690 --> 00:23:07.019
Prof: He played the
organ.

00:23:07.019 --> 00:23:11.130
He was the great organ virtuoso
of his day, and I think at the

00:23:11.130 --> 00:23:14.769
end of this particular fugue
here, it's interesting.

00:23:14.769 --> 00:23:16.660
He just has this line sit there.
 

00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:23.130
&gt;
 

00:23:23.130 --> 00:23:23.453
Okay.
 

00:23:23.453 --> 00:23:27.542
On the organ that would just be
fine and dandy because you'd put

00:23:27.542 --> 00:23:31.113
your foot down there on that low
C &gt;

00:23:31.113 --> 00:23:33.190
&gt;
 

00:23:33.190 --> 00:23:35.368
and that tonic note would
continue to hold,

00:23:35.368 --> 00:23:38.268
but if you were writing this
for the clavichord or the

00:23:38.268 --> 00:23:41.377
harpsichord or the piano,
what happens to that sound once

00:23:41.377 --> 00:23:41.990
you hit it?
 

00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:43.500
It dies away.
 

00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:46.039
I think in the end of this
piece here Bach had the sound of

00:23:46.039 --> 00:23:46.608
the organ .
 

00:23:46.608 --> 00:23:48.200
He didn't really--he wasn't
thinking "gee,

00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:50.420
if this is really for a
harpsichord or something,

00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:58.404
I'd better write this like
this-- &lt;&lt;plays

00:23:58.404 --> 00:24:01.009
piano&gt;&gt;
 

00:24:01.009 --> 00:24:03.094
so we get a nice,
strong tonic sound at the

00:24:03.094 --> 00:24:03.690
end."
 

00:24:03.690 --> 00:24:07.618
He may have had the sound of
the organ there in his ear,

00:24:07.618 --> 00:24:10.862
but perhaps the important point
here is this idea of a pedal

00:24:10.862 --> 00:24:14.324
point 'cause we've actually even
talked about that before in the

00:24:14.324 --> 00:24:17.675
Johannes Brahms Variations on
a Theme of Haydn that was

00:24:17.675 --> 00:24:19.380
performed Saturday night.
 

00:24:19.380 --> 00:24:20.930
Pedal point is what?
 

00:24:20.930 --> 00:24:25.789
Anybody who can define pedal
point for us?

00:24:25.789 --> 00:24:27.259
Hm?
 

00:24:27.259 --> 00:24:28.077
Well, what goes on?
 

00:24:28.077 --> 00:24:28.940
It's pretty simple.
 

00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:30.730
Roger.
 

00:24:30.730 --> 00:24:34.038
Student: The bass holds
a note &gt;

00:24:34.038 --> 00:24:35.038
Prof: Yeah.
 

00:24:35.038 --> 00:24:38.035
The bass holds a note and
basically you're just kind of

00:24:38.035 --> 00:24:41.086
running over top of one,
possibly two harmonies up above

00:24:41.086 --> 00:24:43.140
it, but it all sounds consonant.
 

00:24:43.140 --> 00:24:46.648
So just be sure of the idea of
one note usually in the bass

00:24:46.648 --> 00:24:49.069
just holding,
holding, holding for a long

00:24:49.069 --> 00:24:50.220
period of time.
 

00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:55.710
 
 

00:24:55.710 --> 00:24:58.088
Okay.
 

00:24:58.088 --> 00:25:01.328
Any questions about that fugue
by J.S. Bach?

00:25:01.328 --> 00:25:03.349
Anybody want to ask anything
about that?

00:25:03.349 --> 00:25:07.640
 
 

00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:09.549
Marcus, that works for you?
 

00:25:09.549 --> 00:25:12.619
Ugonna, okay?
 

00:25:12.619 --> 00:25:15.039
Thaddeus, no questions?
 

00:25:15.039 --> 00:25:17.759
Frederick.
 

00:25:17.759 --> 00:25:21.039
Student: At the very end
that's a total of what?

00:25:21.039 --> 00:25:22.730
Four notes being played at once?
 

00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:24.378
Prof: Oh,
okay.

00:25:24.378 --> 00:25:24.770
Good.
 

00:25:24.770 --> 00:25:25.400
Yeah.
 

00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:26.380
Thanks for bringing that out.
 

00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:29.650
There at the end we could even
have--

00:25:29.650 --> 00:25:31.752
you're right--four,
maybe even five notes played at

00:25:31.752 --> 00:25:33.729
once,
so this idea that you--once you

00:25:33.729 --> 00:25:36.743
have three parts you can only
have three parts or once you

00:25:36.743 --> 00:25:39.242
have five-voice fugue,
you can have no more than five

00:25:39.242 --> 00:25:41.670
voices--
breaks down at the very end.

00:25:41.670 --> 00:25:44.655
Why would you imagine a
composer would want to do that,

00:25:44.655 --> 00:25:45.318
Frederick?
 

00:25:45.318 --> 00:25:46.769
Student:
&gt;

00:25:46.769 --> 00:25:48.588
pieces at one time.
 

00:25:48.588 --> 00:25:51.836
Prof: Well,
no, it's not that hard because

00:25:51.836 --> 00:25:53.371
you--
once you get used to the idea

00:25:53.371 --> 00:25:55.547
of a C major triad,
you--a musician would look at

00:25:55.547 --> 00:25:57.863
that end and say,
"I've just got a C major

00:25:57.863 --> 00:25:58.200
triad.
 

00:25:58.200 --> 00:25:59.470
I'm going to just bang down on
it."

00:25:59.470 --> 00:26:01.534
So that's not hard technically
or intellectually,

00:26:01.534 --> 00:26:03.942
but why would a--the--you
raised a very interesting point

00:26:03.942 --> 00:26:04.328
here.
 

00:26:04.328 --> 00:26:07.028
Why would a composer want to
add more notes at the end?

00:26:07.028 --> 00:26:08.579
I think it's a pretty
straightforward idea.

00:26:08.579 --> 00:26:12.000
David? Michael, yeah.
 

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:12.308
Student: They make it
louder.

00:26:12.308 --> 00:26:14.101
Prof: Yeah,
just make it louder,

00:26:14.101 --> 00:26:16.344
make it more sonorous,
a big bang ending sort of

00:26:16.344 --> 00:26:18.395
thing, yeah,
to tell the listener once again

00:26:18.395 --> 00:26:21.308
that this is something special
and we're probably at the end.

00:26:21.308 --> 00:26:21.904
All right.
 

00:26:21.904 --> 00:26:24.230
So let's listen to just a bit
of this.

00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:25.858
We had one version of this.
 

00:26:25.858 --> 00:26:29.769
Let's listen to a contemporary
jazz ensemble playing.

00:26:29.769 --> 00:26:34.061
It starts out with a kind of
guitar synthesizer with a piano

00:26:34.061 --> 00:26:38.210
here and then we'll see what the
other instruments are.

00:26:38.210 --> 00:26:41.890
Here's a jazz rendition of the
same fugue by Bach.

00:26:41.890 --> 00:27:14.328
&gt;
 

00:27:14.328 --> 00:27:17.029
What instrument is playing this
bass line?

00:27:17.029 --> 00:27:30.019
&gt;
 

00:27:30.019 --> 00:27:30.656
Okay.
 

00:27:30.656 --> 00:27:38.180
Here we are in bar thirteen,
&gt;

00:27:38.180 --> 00:27:42.777
fifteen, subject in the inner
voice.

00:27:42.777 --> 00:27:46.848
&gt;
 

00:27:46.848 --> 00:27:49.266
Here's our invertible
counterpoint,

00:27:49.266 --> 00:27:51.470
&gt;
 

00:27:51.470 --> 00:28:00.210
switch, &lt;&lt;music
playing&gt;&gt;

00:28:00.210 --> 00:28:08.970
subject soprano,
&gt;

00:28:08.970 --> 00:28:14.019
now just modulating from one
key to the next here.

00:28:14.019 --> 00:28:37.000
&gt;
 

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:40.740
And here they actually do
repeat that tonic note,

00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:42.608
&gt;.
 

00:28:42.608 --> 00:28:42.730
Okay.
 

00:28:42.730 --> 00:28:43.460
&gt;
 

00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:45.808
And then what they do is go off
and improvise on that.

00:28:45.808 --> 00:28:50.291
But it's interesting,
the similarity between jazz

00:28:50.291 --> 00:28:52.720
style and Baroque music.
 

00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:53.980
Why is that the case?
 

00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:56.897
Well, Baroque music has a lot
of driving rhythm in it,

00:28:56.897 --> 00:29:00.201
kind of regular rhythm in it,
and jazz has a kind of regular,

00:29:00.201 --> 00:29:01.910
pulsating rhythm in it too.
 

00:29:01.910 --> 00:29:06.411
I asked you what instrument was
playing the bass line there and

00:29:06.411 --> 00:29:10.838
Daniel, you started going like
this so what were you doing?

00:29:10.838 --> 00:29:11.420
Student:
&gt;

00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:14.959
Prof: The double bass of
the--but is it bowed?

00:29:14.959 --> 00:29:15.298
No.
 

00:29:15.298 --> 00:29:17.628
It's a plucked,
a pizzicato double bass,

00:29:17.628 --> 00:29:20.615
but that's a standard
instrument in a jazz quartet,

00:29:20.615 --> 00:29:21.690
jazz ensemble.
 

00:29:21.690 --> 00:29:25.957
But it's a very strong bass and
Baroque music also has a very

00:29:25.957 --> 00:29:29.015
strong bass, so lots of
similarities between

00:29:29.015 --> 00:29:31.858
contemporary jazz and baroque
music.

00:29:31.858 --> 00:29:35.635
And sometimes these jazz
ensembles like to get to this

00:29:35.635 --> 00:29:39.269
Baroque music and resurrect them
in modern idiom.

00:29:39.269 --> 00:29:40.028
All right.
 

00:29:40.028 --> 00:29:44.200
So normally a fugue is a
freestanding piece or you could

00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:47.690
have an entire movement written
as a fugue.

00:29:47.690 --> 00:29:51.433
Haydn--the last movement of the
Haydn quartets will sometimes do

00:29:51.433 --> 00:29:53.693
that,
a Beethoven piano sonata might

00:29:53.693 --> 00:29:55.506
do that,
but usually they're

00:29:55.506 --> 00:29:56.848
freestanding pieces.
 

00:29:56.848 --> 00:29:59.942
Occasionally,
you run into a fugue that's

00:29:59.942 --> 00:30:02.650
embedded inside another
movement.

00:30:02.650 --> 00:30:06.622
You might have a movement in
sonata-allegro form and you get

00:30:06.622 --> 00:30:09.556
to a particular section,
let's say the development

00:30:09.556 --> 00:30:12.367
section, and the composer says,
"Well, I want to write a

00:30:12.367 --> 00:30:14.028
fugue here as my
development."

00:30:14.028 --> 00:30:19.969
When that happens we call it a
fugato, so a fugato is a fugue

00:30:19.969 --> 00:30:22.838
placed inside another form.
 

00:30:22.838 --> 00:30:26.133
So we're going to listen to an
example of this from the

00:30:26.133 --> 00:30:29.670
romantic period in which we have
the young composer Georges

00:30:29.670 --> 00:30:30.278
Bizet.
 

00:30:30.278 --> 00:30:32.539
He was exactly your age when he
wrote this.

00:30:32.539 --> 00:30:34.338
He was nineteen years old.
 

00:30:34.338 --> 00:30:36.788
Georges Bizet wrote this
symphony.

00:30:36.788 --> 00:30:39.116
There's a lovely romantic
string sound,

00:30:39.116 --> 00:30:43.160
sort of break-your-heart string
sound, and then we have a segue.

00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:46.726
We have kind of a romantic
transition here as he changes

00:30:46.726 --> 00:30:50.615
mood and then a fugue will break
out and it will start in the

00:30:50.615 --> 00:30:53.470
bottom voice so I'll tell you
that much.

00:30:53.470 --> 00:30:55.971
And my question to you or my
challenge to you is this:

00:30:55.971 --> 00:30:56.868
What's the order?
 

00:30:56.868 --> 00:30:58.519
Let's say--and I'll tell you
this.

00:30:58.519 --> 00:31:00.838
We've got a four-voice fugue
that's going to start here.

00:31:00.838 --> 00:31:04.279
Can you track the order in
which the voices enter?

00:31:04.279 --> 00:31:05.920
You know we've got the four.
 

00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:07.612
You've got the bass,
tenor, soprano,

00:31:07.612 --> 00:31:08.869
alto--or bass,
tenor, alto,

00:31:08.869 --> 00:31:10.416
soprano, or soprano,
alto, tenor,

00:31:10.416 --> 00:31:10.950
bass.
 

00:31:10.950 --> 00:31:13.140
They can come in any one of
four different--

00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:18.061
well, probably more than four
permutations but the order might

00:31:18.061 --> 00:31:19.828
be alto,
bass, soprano,

00:31:19.828 --> 00:31:22.423
tenor or it might be bass,
alto, tenor,

00:31:22.423 --> 00:31:25.338
soprano or soprano,
alto, tenor and bass.

00:31:25.338 --> 00:31:27.411
We don't know,
and that's your challenge here

00:31:27.411 --> 00:31:29.200
to see if you can track the
subject.

00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:31.509
Here we go.
 

00:31:31.509 --> 00:31:55.309
&gt;
 

00:31:55.309 --> 00:31:57.349
Start.
 

00:31:57.349 --> 00:32:31.868
&gt;
 

00:32:31.868 --> 00:32:32.163
Okay.
 

00:32:32.163 --> 00:32:34.866
We're going to stop it there
just for a minute.

00:32:34.866 --> 00:32:36.630
We're going to pause there.
 

00:32:36.630 --> 00:32:38.410
That's the--all four voices are
in there.

00:32:38.410 --> 00:32:41.430
Could anybody on just one
hearing tell me what the order

00:32:41.430 --> 00:32:41.759
was?
 

00:32:41.759 --> 00:32:45.690
 
 

00:32:45.690 --> 00:32:46.356
Okay.
 

00:32:46.356 --> 00:32:50.759
Let me--somebody different
here.

00:32:50.759 --> 00:32:52.700
Robert, I haven't called on you
this morning.

00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:53.509
Student:
&gt;

00:32:53.509 --> 00:32:54.084
Prof: Okay.
 

00:32:54.084 --> 00:32:55.650
It started with bass
&gt;

00:32:55.650 --> 00:33:00.231
or maybe even an octave lower.
 

00:33:00.231 --> 00:33:04.509
&gt;
 

00:33:04.509 --> 00:33:07.220
Okay. Then where did he go?
 

00:33:07.220 --> 00:33:08.140
Student: Alto.
 

00:33:08.140 --> 00:33:12.421
Prof: Yeah,
it actually went to the alto

00:33:12.421 --> 00:33:15.119
&gt;
 

00:33:15.119 --> 00:33:16.769
and there--and then where?
 

00:33:16.769 --> 00:33:23.538
Tenor &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:33:23.538 --> 00:33:27.058
and then finally--yeah,
&gt;

00:33:27.058 --> 00:33:29.583
way up high in the first
violins.

00:33:29.583 --> 00:33:31.868
&gt;
 

00:33:31.868 --> 00:33:35.851
And now we're going to get
a--an episode in which he's

00:33:35.851 --> 00:33:39.832
going to play with just a
motive, and then the subject

00:33:39.832 --> 00:33:41.259
will come back.
 

00:33:41.259 --> 00:33:43.038
So here are two questions for
you.

00:33:43.038 --> 00:33:47.046
In which voice is the subject
coming back and what's happened

00:33:47.046 --> 00:33:49.450
to the subject when it comes
back?

00:33:49.450 --> 00:33:50.519
It's changed in one way.
 

00:33:50.519 --> 00:34:03.170
&gt;
 

00:34:03.170 --> 00:34:04.869
Okay. Let's stop it there.
 

00:34:04.869 --> 00:34:06.190
Any takers on that?
 

00:34:06.190 --> 00:34:08.367
And if we were doing a quiz on
this, we'd give you three or

00:34:08.367 --> 00:34:09.269
four playings of that.
 

00:34:09.269 --> 00:34:12.179
Which voice did it come back in?
 

00:34:12.179 --> 00:34:17.860
&gt;
 

00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:19.210
Thaddeus.
 

00:34:19.210 --> 00:34:20.090
Student:
&gt;

00:34:20.090 --> 00:34:21.295
Prof: Not bad.
 

00:34:21.295 --> 00:34:24.853
We would take that because it's
kind of high--I'm playing it in

00:34:24.853 --> 00:34:26.460
kind of tenor range here.
 

00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:29.469
I think it was more cellos and
we'd probably--

00:34:29.469 --> 00:34:31.760
with bassoons--and we'd
probably call that bass,

00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:34.052
a bass part,
but fair enough,

00:34:34.052 --> 00:34:39.132
tenor,
and what happened to it?

00:34:39.132 --> 00:34:44.199
&gt;
 

00:34:44.199 --> 00:34:44.755
Roger.
 

00:34:44.755 --> 00:34:45.311
Minor.
 

00:34:45.311 --> 00:34:48.000
&gt;
 

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:51.536
So he modulated to a different
key and then gave you the

00:34:51.536 --> 00:34:55.422
subject in a minor key,
and that's kind of the way

00:34:55.422 --> 00:34:58.809
these fugues operate,
give you an exposition episode

00:34:58.809 --> 00:35:01.547
in which you change key,
bring back the subject in a

00:35:01.547 --> 00:35:02.380
different key.
 

00:35:02.380 --> 00:35:02.983
All right.
 

00:35:02.983 --> 00:35:06.309
So we've now had a fugue from
the nineteenth century,

00:35:06.309 --> 00:35:09.472
although we would call it a
fugato because it's embedded in

00:35:09.472 --> 00:35:12.389
this lovely,
lovely sonata-allegro movement.

00:35:12.389 --> 00:35:14.978
Let's turn to a fugue from the
twentieth century,

00:35:14.978 --> 00:35:18.106
and for this we go to Leonard
Bernstein and you can see the

00:35:18.106 --> 00:35:19.670
playlist up on the board.
 

00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:24.474
New Haven used to be a favorite
try-out city for Broadway

00:35:24.474 --> 00:35:25.420
musicals.
 

00:35:25.420 --> 00:35:28.719
Indeed there was a musical
entitled--it never went

00:35:28.719 --> 00:35:29.460
anywhere.
 

00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:31.762
It was entitled We Bombed in
New Haven,

00:35:31.762 --> 00:35:34.268
meaning that the try-out
&gt;

00:35:34.268 --> 00:35:37.655
of the particular musical was
not a success,

00:35:37.655 --> 00:35:41.119
and where would they try out in
New Haven?

00:35:41.119 --> 00:35:44.445
What was the great theater for
this?

00:35:44.445 --> 00:35:44.920
Hm?
 

00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:45.630
Student: The repertory
theater?

00:35:45.630 --> 00:35:47.159
Prof: The Yale Rep
Theatre?

00:35:47.159 --> 00:35:48.369
Any other takers?
 

00:35:48.369 --> 00:35:50.550
The Shubert Theater.
 

00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:54.005
Yeah, actually in that period
the Yale Rep was actually a

00:35:54.005 --> 00:35:55.920
functioning house of worship.
 

00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:58.599
It was a church at that
--what's now the Yale Rep.

00:35:58.599 --> 00:36:01.708
So is it the Shubert Theater,
which has been here for a long,

00:36:01.708 --> 00:36:02.329
long time?
 

00:36:02.329 --> 00:36:05.670
So Leonard Bernstein came in
here with a show in 1952 called

00:36:05.670 --> 00:36:08.559
Wonderful Town and he
tried it out there,

00:36:08.559 --> 00:36:12.038
and generally speaking it was a
success and he took it down the

00:36:12.038 --> 00:36:13.889
train tracks there to Broadway.
 

00:36:13.889 --> 00:36:17.092
But he took some music out of
it, some music that he thought

00:36:17.092 --> 00:36:20.405
actually was a little bit too
complicated for the choreography

00:36:20.405 --> 00:36:24.092
that he wanted to work into it--
later took that material and

00:36:24.092 --> 00:36:27.621
worked it in to a freestanding
piece called "Prelude,

00:36:27.621 --> 00:36:29.480
Fugue, and Jazz Riff."
 

00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:33.132
So we're going to look at now
just the fugue portion of it

00:36:33.132 --> 00:36:36.210
because it's a very interesting
kind of fugue.

00:36:36.210 --> 00:36:37.940
It's a very complex fugue.
 

00:36:37.940 --> 00:36:40.382
So we're going to start out
here and I'm going to break

00:36:40.382 --> 00:36:40.699
this.
 

00:36:40.699 --> 00:36:43.987
We'll listen,
we'll stop, we'll listen and

00:36:43.987 --> 00:36:48.079
stop so that we can focus on
particular passages.

00:36:48.079 --> 00:36:52.030
So as we start to listen,
see how many voices there are

00:36:52.030 --> 00:36:54.300
in Leonard Bernstein's fugue.
 

00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:56.773
Have a general sense of what
the range is:

00:36:56.773 --> 00:36:58.099
soprano, alto,
bass.

00:36:58.099 --> 00:36:59.018
What else do we need?
 

00:36:59.018 --> 00:36:59.391
Oh, yeah.
 

00:36:59.391 --> 00:37:00.840
What instruments are playing
here?

00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:29.260
&gt;
 

00:37:29.260 --> 00:37:29.628
Okay.
 

00:37:29.628 --> 00:37:33.987
So that's the exposition and a
little bit of the development

00:37:33.987 --> 00:37:36.130
there so what instruments?
 

00:37:36.130 --> 00:37:39.400
Hm? Ducks?
 

00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:39.980
Student: Saxophones?
 

00:37:39.980 --> 00:37:41.119
Prof: Yeah, saxophones.
 

00:37:41.119 --> 00:37:41.402
Yeah.
 

00:37:41.402 --> 00:37:41.686
Okay.
 

00:37:41.686 --> 00:37:44.070
Kneeland said saxophones and
he's right.

00:37:44.070 --> 00:37:45.320
Yeah, so saxophones there.
 

00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:48.168
So we've got--and then
how--roughly how many did you

00:37:48.168 --> 00:37:48.559
hear?
 

00:37:48.559 --> 00:37:51.030
Two, three, four?
 

00:37:51.030 --> 00:37:53.452
Yeah, maybe four,
maybe four different

00:37:53.452 --> 00:37:57.380
saxophones, sort of alto sax,
maybe baritone sax in there.

00:37:57.380 --> 00:38:02.307
And there was one--and so we
are playing this out and it's a

00:38:02.307 --> 00:38:07.070
rather syncopated fugue,
sort of &gt;.

00:38:07.070 --> 00:38:09.460
Let's listen to it again.
 

00:38:09.460 --> 00:38:11.677
No, we don't have time to do
that but here's one thing that

00:38:11.677 --> 00:38:13.170
happened, &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:38:13.170 --> 00:38:15.909
that kind of sound,
&gt;.

00:38:15.909 --> 00:38:19.483
Then after one episode one of
the saxes brought back that

00:38:19.483 --> 00:38:19.994
subject.
 

00:38:19.994 --> 00:38:21.909
&gt;
 

00:38:21.909 --> 00:38:24.875
What's it doing there?
 

00:38:24.875 --> 00:38:28.650
&gt;
 

00:38:28.650 --> 00:38:29.940
What is that?
 

00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:31.239
What's the relationship there?
 

00:38:31.239 --> 00:38:32.018
Student: Is it inverting
it?

00:38:32.018 --> 00:38:34.489
Prof: Yeah,
it's just inverting it.

00:38:34.489 --> 00:38:36.675
It is taking the intervals and
flipping them and that's what

00:38:36.675 --> 00:38:38.010
composers love to do with
fugues,

00:38:38.010 --> 00:38:40.449
and I'll be talking about
interchangeable parts,

00:38:40.449 --> 00:38:44.601
reciprocal relationships with
the mathematical quality of

00:38:44.601 --> 00:38:45.268
fugues.
 

00:38:45.268 --> 00:38:47.070
And so that's what's happening
here.

00:38:47.070 --> 00:38:49.809
We have a moment of melodic
inversion.

00:38:49.809 --> 00:38:52.211
And sometimes in fugues--and
Bach's did this in the musical

00:38:52.211 --> 00:38:54.498
offering--
he can take his fugue subject

00:38:54.498 --> 00:38:58.016
and run it backwards from
beginning to end so they like to

00:38:58.016 --> 00:39:02.150
have these kind of mathematical
permutations of these intervals.

00:39:02.150 --> 00:39:04.630
It's very cerebral stuff,
this fugue business.

00:39:04.630 --> 00:39:09.898
So there we had just a moment
of Leonard Bernstein writing a

00:39:09.898 --> 00:39:12.219
little bit of inversion.
 

00:39:12.219 --> 00:39:15.688
Now what we're about to hear
next is something of a surprise

00:39:15.688 --> 00:39:18.039
because we get a second fugue
subject.

00:39:18.039 --> 00:39:20.349
And it's a different fugue
subject;

00:39:20.349 --> 00:39:22.420
it is not syncopated.
 

00:39:22.420 --> 00:39:27.409
It's rather lyrical,
&gt;

00:39:27.409 --> 00:39:30.940
&gt;
 

00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:32.210
something like that.
 

00:39:32.210 --> 00:39:34.260
So it's nice and lyrical.
 

00:39:34.260 --> 00:39:40.659
And let's listen to how he now
unfolds a second fugue subject.

00:39:40.659 --> 00:39:43.079
So what we have here is called
a double-fugue.

00:39:43.079 --> 00:39:45.860
He's got one exposition with
one fugue subject.

00:39:45.860 --> 00:40:01.114
Now he's going to give us a
completely different exposition

00:40:01.114 --> 00:40:17.949
with yet a second fugue subject,
&gt;

00:40:17.949 --> 00:40:19.295
and then number one comes back.
 

00:40:19.295 --> 00:40:20.599
&gt;
 

00:40:20.599 --> 00:40:20.880
Okay.
 

00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:24.030
We're going to pause it here
because he's now about to do

00:40:24.030 --> 00:40:27.460
something rather interesting
that Bach used to do as well.

00:40:27.460 --> 00:40:30.809
And Bernstein was a consummate
musician, had studied Bach,

00:40:30.809 --> 00:40:33.925
had Bach coming out of his
ears, so he knew about this

00:40:33.925 --> 00:40:35.159
particular trick.
 

00:40:35.159 --> 00:40:36.329
It's called stretto.
 

00:40:36.329 --> 00:40:39.420
You can design a fugue subject,
not only that it could go

00:40:39.420 --> 00:40:42.081
upside down,
but in which the intervals

00:40:42.081 --> 00:40:46.027
instead of coming in long
succession could be piled right

00:40:46.027 --> 00:40:47.789
on top of one another.
 

00:40:47.789 --> 00:40:50.590
So the way he sets this thing
up to begin with is this,

00:40:50.590 --> 00:40:55.257
this, maybe this and then this,
but in the next section it's

00:40:55.257 --> 00:40:59.650
going to go this,
this, this and this.

00:40:59.650 --> 00:41:02.900
The intervals back up on each
other because they have been

00:41:02.900 --> 00:41:06.039
arranged to be consonant at key
points and that's called

00:41:06.039 --> 00:41:08.885
stretto,
Italian word stretto,

00:41:08.885 --> 00:41:11.000
kind of tight--
tight entries here.

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:14.454
So here is fancy little bit of
counterpoint by Leonard

00:41:14.454 --> 00:41:17.650
Bernstein that once again goes
by very quickly.

00:41:17.650 --> 00:41:20.960
&gt;
 

00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:22.590
Do you hear it?
 

00:41:22.590 --> 00:41:34.018
&gt;
 

00:41:34.018 --> 00:41:36.880
Now he's going to bring back
the two subjects together.

00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:42.599
We have one and two together,
&gt;

00:41:42.599 --> 00:41:46.489
episode, &lt;&lt;music
playing&gt;&gt;

00:41:46.489 --> 00:41:50.349
syncopated episode,
&gt;

00:41:50.349 --> 00:41:53.480
one, &lt;&lt;music
playing&gt;&gt;

00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:57.179
two, &lt;&lt;music
playing&gt;&gt;

00:41:57.179 --> 00:41:57.911
and so on.
 

00:41:57.911 --> 00:42:00.110
&gt;
 

00:42:00.110 --> 00:42:03.331
So it's a pretty nifty little
fugue there by Leonard Bernstein

00:42:03.331 --> 00:42:06.130
with lots of intricate
counterpoint involved in it.

00:42:06.130 --> 00:42:07.117
All right.
 

00:42:07.117 --> 00:42:12.751
Let's end now with a fugue of
J.S. Bach and for that we're

00:42:12.751 --> 00:42:18.978
going to turn to an organ fugue
that he wrote about 1710 when he

00:42:18.978 --> 00:42:22.239
was a young man in Weimar.
 

00:42:22.239 --> 00:42:42.289
Here is that fugue subject
&gt;

00:42:42.289 --> 00:42:43.440
and on and on and on it goes.
 

00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:45.989
What's of interest about this
subject?

00:42:45.989 --> 00:42:47.159
Well, two things.
 

00:42:47.159 --> 00:42:50.782
First of all,
as I sing this

00:42:50.782 --> 00:42:53.869
&gt;
 

00:42:53.869 --> 00:42:55.150
what is that?
 

00:42:55.150 --> 00:43:01.320
&gt;
 

00:43:01.320 --> 00:43:04.679
It's an--
Student: Arpeggio.

00:43:04.679 --> 00:43:06.400
Prof: Arpeggio.
 

00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:09.150
Yes, it is, but it's an
arpeggio of what?

00:43:09.150 --> 00:43:11.889
&gt;
 

00:43:11.889 --> 00:43:14.000
&gt;
 

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:18.380
It's a triad,
just a minor triad.

00:43:18.380 --> 00:43:19.811
&gt;
 

00:43:19.811 --> 00:43:23.014
One, five, three,
one, if I skip this note here.

00:43:23.014 --> 00:43:24.650
&gt;
 

00:43:24.650 --> 00:43:27.864
As I come to every strong beat
in this theme,

00:43:27.864 --> 00:43:31.298
every strong beat,
I have a member of the triad,

00:43:31.298 --> 00:43:33.929
that same either G,
B-flat or D.

00:43:33.929 --> 00:43:38.411
So these triads as we said
before are really the structure,

00:43:38.411 --> 00:43:41.659
the backbone,
on which a composer like Bach

00:43:41.659 --> 00:43:45.059
will place the flesh of a fugue
subject.

00:43:45.059 --> 00:43:48.268
So it's very triadic and it
sounds pretty secure for that .

00:43:48.268 --> 00:43:51.152
Now here's another thing that
this fugue subject does and many

00:43:51.152 --> 00:43:52.239
other fugue subjects.
 

00:43:52.239 --> 00:43:54.210
It starts with quarter notes,
&gt;

00:43:54.210 --> 00:43:57.469
quarter, quarter,
quarter, then next measure,

00:43:57.469 --> 00:43:58.961
eighth, eighth,
eighth, eighth,

00:43:58.961 --> 00:44:01.063
eighth,
eighth, and then we get in here

00:44:01.063 --> 00:44:03.735
eighth,
eighth, eighth,

00:44:03.735 --> 00:44:07.119
&gt;.
 

00:44:07.119 --> 00:44:08.719
It's gathering speed.
 

00:44:08.719 --> 00:44:10.440
Of course, the beat isn't going
any faster.

00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:11.920
The tempo is staying the same.
 

00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:14.420
He's simply writing shorter
note values,

00:44:14.420 --> 00:44:16.010
which has the psychological
impact,

00:44:16.010 --> 00:44:18.905
as we've said several times,
of giving the sense of

00:44:18.905 --> 00:44:21.389
movement,
gathering speed here.

00:44:21.389 --> 00:44:23.980
It's like a train pulling out
of the station.

00:44:23.980 --> 00:44:25.420
We want to get on this train.
 

00:44:25.420 --> 00:44:30.112
This thing is really starting
to roll after five measures or

00:44:30.112 --> 00:44:30.510
so.
 

00:44:30.510 --> 00:44:34.693
So it's a pretty nifty fugue
subject here and we're going to

00:44:34.693 --> 00:44:38.166
listen to this now,
and what I'd like to do is the

00:44:38.166 --> 00:44:39.159
following.
 

00:44:39.159 --> 00:44:41.268
We're going to listen to the
entire piece.

00:44:41.268 --> 00:44:51.210
Think about--as the voices come
in, think about where they're

00:44:51.210 --> 00:44:53.199
coming in.
 

00:44:53.199 --> 00:44:57.047
Can you tell me what the
trajectory of the voices is in

00:44:57.047 --> 00:44:58.260
the exposition?
 

00:44:58.260 --> 00:45:00.690
And I'm going to turn out the
lights here because sometimes

00:45:00.690 --> 00:45:03.039
it's good just to kind of go off
into your own world,

00:45:03.039 --> 00:45:05.202
close your eyes,
but I would like you to do the

00:45:05.202 --> 00:45:06.050
following thing.
 

00:45:06.050 --> 00:45:11.860
Kind of lean back,
get comfortable,

00:45:11.860 --> 00:45:19.208
close your eyes,
but every time you hear the

00:45:19.208 --> 00:45:27.239
fugue subject-- &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:45:27.239 --> 00:45:30.885
and so on--every time you hear
that fugue subject raise your

00:45:30.885 --> 00:45:34.038
hand so that I know you're
recognizing that it's the

00:45:34.038 --> 00:45:34.780
subject.
 

00:45:34.780 --> 00:45:37.302
Because listening to fugues,
it's basically one thing:

00:45:37.302 --> 00:45:39.873
Differentiating between a
passage in which you've got a

00:45:39.873 --> 00:45:42.682
statement of the subject and an
episode where there ain't no

00:45:42.682 --> 00:45:44.159
statement of the subject.
 

00:45:44.159 --> 00:45:44.443
Okay.
 

00:45:44.443 --> 00:45:47.748
So this is a three minute and
twenty-second fugue and we're

00:45:47.748 --> 00:45:49.969
going to listen to the whole
thing,

00:45:49.969 --> 00:45:53.081
but do raise your hand when you
think that fugue subject is in

00:45:53.081 --> 00:45:53.489
there.
 

00:45:53.489 --> 00:46:45.239
&gt;
 

00:46:45.239 --> 00:46:49.300
So we've gone soprano,
alto, tenor and now bass.

00:46:49.300 --> 00:47:05.989
&gt;
 

00:47:05.989 --> 00:47:07.650
Yeah, there it is.
 

00:47:07.650 --> 00:47:10.090
It's in one of those inner
voices.

00:47:10.090 --> 00:47:12.860
It's a little bit disguised but
it's in there.

00:47:12.860 --> 00:47:29.230
&gt;
 

00:47:29.230 --> 00:47:36.909
Yep, &lt;&lt;music
playing&gt;&gt;

00:47:36.909 --> 00:47:38.239
inner voice.
 

00:47:38.239 --> 00:47:49.949
&gt;
 

00:47:49.949 --> 00:47:52.420
Yep, way down in the bass.
 

00:47:52.420 --> 00:48:03.900
&gt;
 

00:48:03.900 --> 00:48:08.960
A nice, long sequence here
&gt;

00:48:08.960 --> 00:48:19.150
&gt;
 

00:48:19.150 --> 00:48:23.599
Yep, all the way up on top in
the soprano.

00:48:23.599 --> 00:48:31.699
&gt;
 

00:48:31.699 --> 00:48:36.650
Another episode,
descending sequence this time.

00:48:36.650 --> 00:48:44.349
&gt;
 

00:48:44.349 --> 00:48:48.030
Rising sequences here,
&gt;

00:48:48.030 --> 00:48:54.530
falling sequences &lt;&lt;music
playing&gt;&gt;

00:48:54.530 --> 00:48:58.170
in the bass.
 

00:48:58.170 --> 00:49:12.460
&gt;
 

00:49:12.460 --> 00:49:15.228
Okay, so that's a wonderful
fugue by J.S. Bach and we

00:49:15.228 --> 00:49:18.369
could--we're going to talk more
about this in section,

00:49:18.369 --> 00:49:21.534
this idea how you can run your
fugue parts this way or you

00:49:21.534 --> 00:49:23.090
could order them this way.
 

00:49:23.090 --> 00:49:25.856
You can think of these
constructs mathematically or you

00:49:25.856 --> 00:49:28.878
can think of them musically,
but you're all working with the

00:49:28.878 --> 00:49:30.210
same kind of material.
 

00:49:30.210 --> 00:49:33.257
As you go out,
one final fugue by Glenn Gould

00:49:33.257 --> 00:49:37.342
who is going to teach you how to
write a fugue as he sings a

00:49:37.342 --> 00:49:38.519
fugue to you.
 

00:49:38.519 --> 00:49:56.739
&gt;
 

00:49:56.739 --> 00:50:02.000

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.302
Professor Shelly Kagan:
--Tolstoy's Ivan Ilyich is

00:00:06.302 --> 00:00:09.300
surprised to discover that he's
going to die.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.634
It's the sort of thing he's
given lip service to,

00:00:11.634 --> 00:00:13.580
no doubt, over the course of
his life.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.139
But when he finally gets ill
and comes up to the fact of his

00:00:17.139 --> 00:00:20.577
mortality, that his body is
going to sicken and eventually

00:00:20.577 --> 00:00:24.342
die,
the fact of his mortality seems

00:00:24.342 --> 00:00:28.260
to shock him,
seems to surprise him.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.467
We might say,
on one level he believes that

00:00:31.467 --> 00:00:34.340
he was mortal.
He's believed it all along.

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.400
But at another level,
at some deeper level,

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.960
it comes as a surprise to him.
He never really believed it.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.720
Now, I take it that we find
Ivan Ilyich a perfectly

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.008
believable example.
That is, we think it's

00:00:49.008 --> 00:00:51.701
conceivable that somebody could,
at some level,

00:00:51.701 --> 00:00:54.220
not really believe they're
going to die.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.537
But I also take it that Tolstoy
means to be putting forward more

00:00:57.537 --> 00:01:00.750
than just a claim that there
could be such a person.

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.710
"Look how bizarre he is.
Let me describe him for you."

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:09.378
But rather, the suggestion is
meant to be that Ivan Ilyich's

00:01:09.378 --> 00:01:13.010
case is rather typical.
Maybe all of us are in his

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.659
situation, or at least most of
us are in his situation.

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.522
Or, at the very least,
many of us are in his

00:01:19.522 --> 00:01:22.079
situation.
That's a stronger claim,

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:25.592
though I think it's not the
sort of claim that's unique to

00:01:25.592 --> 00:01:28.733
Tolstoy,
that all of us or most of us or

00:01:28.733 --> 00:01:33.501
many of us at the fundamental
level don't really believe that

00:01:33.501 --> 00:01:36.167
we're going to die.
You might ask,

00:01:36.167 --> 00:01:39.379
what kind of evidence could be
offered for that?

00:01:39.379 --> 00:01:42.965
Offering a realistic scenario,
a realistic description of such

00:01:42.965 --> 00:01:46.610
a person--Ivan Ilyich--doesn't
give us any reason to think that

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.550
most of us or many of us are in
his situation.

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.580
So, is there any reason to
think that?

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.018
You might ask,
what kind of argument could be

00:01:56.018 --> 00:02:00.891
offered for a claim like that?
What we'd be looking for,

00:02:00.891 --> 00:02:06.298
I take it, would be some kind
of behavior on our part that

00:02:06.298 --> 00:02:10.899
calls out for explanation.
And the best explanation is to

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:13.550
be had--This is how the argument
would go.

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.833
The best explanation is to be
had by supposing that those

00:02:16.833 --> 00:02:19.822
people who behave this
way--Let's suppose many of us

00:02:19.822 --> 00:02:22.666
who behave this way.
The best explanation of that

00:02:22.666 --> 00:02:25.539
behavior is to be found by
claiming that at some level,

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:29.372
at some fundamental level,
we don't really believe what we

00:02:29.372 --> 00:02:33.445
claim to believe.
We don't really believe what we

00:02:33.445 --> 00:02:37.451
give lip service to.
Take somebody who perhaps

00:02:37.451 --> 00:02:42.180
suffers from some sort of
compulsion to wash his hands.

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.470
We ask him, "Are your hands
dirty?"

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.669
He might say,
"No, of course not."

00:02:46.669 --> 00:02:49.775
And yet, there he is,
going back to bathroom,

00:02:49.775 --> 00:02:52.609
washing his hands again.
You might say,

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:56.747
the only way to explain the
behavior is to say that at some

00:02:56.747 --> 00:02:59.896
level,
he really does believe his

00:02:59.896 --> 00:03:04.234
hands are dirty,
despite the fact that he says

00:03:04.234 --> 00:03:06.848
they're not.
Well, in the same way,

00:03:06.848 --> 00:03:10.033
if we could find some behavior
on our part that calls out for

00:03:10.033 --> 00:03:11.847
explanation,
that the best possible

00:03:11.847 --> 00:03:14.392
explanation would be that at
some level we don't believe

00:03:14.392 --> 00:03:16.025
we're going to die,
then we might say,

00:03:16.025 --> 00:03:18.074
look, this gives us some reason
to think that we don't really

00:03:18.074 --> 00:03:21.903
believe we're going to die,
even though we say we believe

00:03:21.903 --> 00:03:23.959
it.
Suppose, for example,

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:27.538
that if you really did believe,
fundamentally,

00:03:27.538 --> 00:03:30.390
unconsciously,
all the way down--however we

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.819
should put it--if you really did
believe you were going to die,

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:39.788
the horror of that would lead
you to start screaming and just

00:03:39.788 --> 00:03:43.108
keep screaming.
Of course, this example reminds

00:03:43.108 --> 00:03:45.786
us again of Ivan Ilyich,
who screams and screams and

00:03:45.786 --> 00:03:49.550
screams almost till his death.
Well, suppose this was true.

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:53.753
Suppose that if you--Suppose we
believed--we had good reason to

00:03:53.753 --> 00:03:57.618
believe--if you really took
seriously the thought that you

00:03:57.618 --> 00:04:01.520
were going to die,
you couldn't stop screaming.

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.487
But of course,
nobody here is screaming,

00:04:04.487 --> 00:04:08.671
from which we can conclude none
of us really do believe,

00:04:08.671 --> 00:04:12.019
fundamentally,
deep down, that we're going to

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:15.147
die.
That would be a good argument

00:04:15.147 --> 00:04:19.065
if we had good reason to believe
the conditional,

00:04:19.065 --> 00:04:22.149
the if-then claim.
If only you really truly

00:04:22.149 --> 00:04:25.689
believed you were going to die,
you would scream and scream and

00:04:25.689 --> 00:04:27.649
scream.
That's the crucial premise.

00:04:27.649 --> 00:04:30.336
And of course,
we don't have any good--as far

00:04:30.336 --> 00:04:33.878
as I can see--we don't have any
good reason to believe that

00:04:33.878 --> 00:04:36.294
crucial premise.
You might ask though,

00:04:36.294 --> 00:04:39.651
is there some other behavior,
something else that should tip

00:04:39.651 --> 00:04:41.068
us off,
could tip us off,

00:04:41.068 --> 00:04:44.061
as to whether or not we really
do or don't believe that we're

00:04:44.061 --> 00:04:46.555
going to die?
Well, here's the best that I

00:04:46.555 --> 00:04:49.258
can do.
This strikes me as the most

00:04:49.258 --> 00:04:53.120
plausible contender for an
argument like this.

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.639
As we know, there are people
who have brushes with death.

00:04:56.639 --> 00:04:58.440
They might be,
for example,

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.626
in an accident,
and come close to being killed,

00:05:01.626 --> 00:05:04.120
but walk away without a
scratch.

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:09.307
Or suffer a heart attack and be
on the operating table for some

00:05:09.307 --> 00:05:13.741
number of hours and then,
thanks to cardiac surgery or

00:05:13.741 --> 00:05:16.670
what have you,
be resuscitated.

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:20.794
When people have these near
brushes with death,

00:05:20.794 --> 00:05:26.173
it's easy to believe that the
fact of their mortality is more

00:05:26.173 --> 00:05:30.140
vivid.
It's more before their mind's

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:32.513
eye.
It's something that they now

00:05:32.513 --> 00:05:36.136
really truly do believe.
And the interesting point is

00:05:36.136 --> 00:05:39.243
many people who have this sort
of experience,

00:05:39.243 --> 00:05:42.420
for whom their mortality has
become vivid,

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:44.600
they often say,
"I've got to change my life.

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:48.403
I need to spend less time at
the office and more time with my

00:05:48.403 --> 00:05:52.079
family, telling the people that
I love that I love them,

00:05:52.079 --> 00:05:54.083
doing the things that are
important to me,

00:05:54.083 --> 00:05:56.379
spend less time worrying about
getting ahead,

00:05:56.379 --> 00:05:59.694
making money,
getting the plasma TV,"

00:05:59.694 --> 00:06:05.519
whatever it is.
Let's suppose that this is true

00:06:05.519 --> 00:06:10.740
of all of us,
or at least most of us.

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:16.557
When we find the fact of our
mortality is made vivid,

00:06:16.557 --> 00:06:22.040
when we really truly can see
that we're mortal,

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:25.699
then we change our priorities,
stop giving all the time and

00:06:25.699 --> 00:06:29.610
attention to trying to get ahead
in the rat race and spend more

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:33.270
time with our loved ones doing
what's important to us.

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:38.799
Suppose that claim were true.
Well, armed with that claim,

00:06:38.799 --> 00:06:41.429
we might notice,
well look, of course,

00:06:41.429 --> 00:06:45.480
most of us do spend a lot of
time trying to get ahead,

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:49.122
trying to earn a lot of money,
don't spend the bulk of our

00:06:49.122 --> 00:06:52.701
time doing the things that we
really truly think are most

00:06:52.701 --> 00:06:55.828
important to us,
don't tell our friends,

00:06:55.828 --> 00:07:00.330
don't tell our family members
how much they mean to us,

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:03.632
how much we love them.
What are we to make of that

00:07:03.632 --> 00:07:05.977
fact?
Well, maybe the explanation is,

00:07:05.977 --> 00:07:09.870
although we give lip service to
the claim that we're mortal,

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:14.520
at some more fundamental level,
we don't truly believe it.

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:19.405
The belief's not vivid for us.
We don't believe it all the way

00:07:19.405 --> 00:07:21.943
down.
Well, this is an argument--at

00:07:21.943 --> 00:07:26.000
least it seems to me--that has
some chance of being right.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.220
I'm not at all convinced that
it is right.

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:30.629
But at least it doesn't seem to
be the sort of argument,

00:07:30.629 --> 00:07:33.213
unlike some of the arguments
I've considered last time about

00:07:33.213 --> 00:07:34.619
oh,
nobody believes they're going

00:07:34.619 --> 00:07:36.970
to die because you can't picture
being dead or what have you.

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:40.252
This argument,
I think, has some possibility

00:07:40.252 --> 00:07:43.777
of being right.
It does seem as though people

00:07:43.777 --> 00:07:47.694
who have brushes with death
change their behavior in

00:07:47.694 --> 00:07:51.545
significant ways.
The fact that we don't behave

00:07:51.545 --> 00:07:55.936
in those other ways gives us
some reason to believe that

00:07:55.936 --> 00:08:00.087
perhaps at some level we don't
completely or fully or

00:08:00.087 --> 00:08:03.759
fundamentally believe we're
going to die.

00:08:03.759 --> 00:08:06.899
As I say, I'm not sure whether
that argument's right.

00:08:06.899 --> 00:08:11.600
But at least it's an argument
worth taking seriously.

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:15.167
Let me turn now to a different
claim that sometimes gets made

00:08:15.167 --> 00:08:17.113
about death.
This is the claim--not that

00:08:17.113 --> 00:08:18.680
nobody believes they're going to
die;

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:21.822
that's the one we've been
talking about for the last

00:08:21.822 --> 00:08:25.273
lecture or so--but instead,
the claim that everybody dies

00:08:25.273 --> 00:08:27.932
alone.
This sounds like one of those

00:08:27.932 --> 00:08:30.750
deep insights into the nature of
death.

00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:34.170
It's got that kind of air of
profundity about it that

00:08:34.170 --> 00:08:37.460
philosophy's thought to have or
aspires to have.

00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:41.923
Everyone dies alone.
This is telling us something

00:08:41.923 --> 00:08:45.186
deep and important and
interesting about the nature of

00:08:45.186 --> 00:08:46.846
death.
Now, as it happens,

00:08:46.846 --> 00:08:49.990
this is one I'm going to be
completely dismissive of.

00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:55.092
I think, as far as I can see,
that the claim "we all die

00:08:55.092 --> 00:09:00.844
alone," however we interpret it,
just ends up being implausible

00:09:00.844 --> 00:09:04.168
or false.
I give it such a hard time each

00:09:04.168 --> 00:09:07.859
time I teach this class,
that I'm often tempted to just

00:09:07.859 --> 00:09:10.730
drop it from the discussion
altogether.

00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:12.859
Even though,
if you've done the reading of

00:09:12.859 --> 00:09:14.730
the Edwards paper that I
assigned,

00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:17.699
you have a series of quotes
from Edwards in which people say

00:09:17.699 --> 00:09:20.763
things like, they die alone.
I sometimes come away after

00:09:20.763 --> 00:09:23.870
this discussion thinking,
"Why am I wasting our time?

00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:27.250
Nobody really believes this,
that we all die alone."

00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:31.224
Last year I was virtually ready
to drop it and then,

00:09:31.224 --> 00:09:33.873
I kid you not,
that very afternoon,

00:09:33.873 --> 00:09:36.832
I came across a quote.
I'll share this with you in a

00:09:36.832 --> 00:09:38.022
second.
Somebody saying,

00:09:38.022 --> 00:09:41.037
"Oh, we all die alone."
And then I think it was two

00:09:41.037 --> 00:09:44.333
days later, a week later,
I came across another quote of

00:09:44.333 --> 00:09:46.909
somebody saying,
"Oh, we all die alone."

00:09:46.909 --> 00:09:49.569
It made me think,
"Oh, I guess this is a common

00:09:49.569 --> 00:09:52.950
enough thought."
So here are the two quotes.

00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:55.284
But I think once you start
looking for them,

00:09:55.284 --> 00:09:59.515
you find them everyplace.
This first one is from the folk

00:09:59.515 --> 00:10:04.600
singer Loudon Wainwright III,
from his song Last Man on

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:08.970
Earth.
"We learn to live together and

00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:12.160
then we die alone."
We die alone.

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:14.419
Interesting claim.
It seems to say something

00:10:14.419 --> 00:10:16.580
important about the nature of
death.

00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:20.615
Here's another quote.
This is from the children's

00:10:20.615 --> 00:10:23.549
book, Eldest by
Christopher Paolini,

00:10:23.549 --> 00:10:26.272
the sequel, of course,
to the bestseller

00:10:26.272 --> 00:10:29.687
Eragon.
"‘How terrible,' said Eragon,

00:10:29.687 --> 00:10:32.851
‘to die alone,
separate, even from the one who

00:10:32.851 --> 00:10:36.319
is closest to you.'"
The answer given to Eragon,

00:10:36.319 --> 00:10:39.944
"Everyone dies alone,
Eragon, whether you are a king

00:10:39.944 --> 00:10:44.067
on a battlefield or a lowly
peasant lying in bed among your

00:10:44.067 --> 00:10:47.612
family,
no one can accompany you into

00:10:47.612 --> 00:10:50.769
the void…" Everyone dies
alone.

00:10:50.769 --> 00:10:53.780
As I say, this is a common
enough view.

00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:56.283
Two quotes.
I could certainly produce

00:10:56.283 --> 00:10:59.000
others.
Everyone dies alone.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.612
The trick--The question we're
going to ask is,

00:11:02.612 --> 00:11:07.429
can we find some interpretation
of that claim under which,

00:11:07.429 --> 00:11:12.359
first of all it ends up being
true, secondly,

00:11:12.359 --> 00:11:17.850
it ends up being a necessary
truth about death?

00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:22.317
Suppose everyone happens to die
on Monday, due to some cosmic

00:11:22.317 --> 00:11:24.431
coincidence.
It might be sort of

00:11:24.431 --> 00:11:27.816
interesting, but it wouldn't
tell us something deep about the

00:11:27.816 --> 00:11:30.411
nature of death,
if people could just as easily

00:11:30.411 --> 00:11:33.246
die on Tuesday.
If it happened to be that

00:11:33.246 --> 00:11:36.796
everybody dies in a room by
themselves, that would be

00:11:36.796 --> 00:11:39.330
interesting.
We might wonder what causes it.

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:42.500
But it wouldn't be some deep
insight into the nature of

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:44.604
death.
We're going to get a deep

00:11:44.604 --> 00:11:47.546
insight if it's a
necessary truth about

00:11:47.546 --> 00:11:51.009
death that everyone dies alone.
So it's got to be true.

00:11:51.009 --> 00:11:53.049
It's got to be a necessary
truth.

00:11:53.049 --> 00:11:56.730
And, of course,
it's got to be an interesting

00:11:56.730 --> 00:11:59.579
claim.
If, when we interpret the claim

00:11:59.579 --> 00:12:03.516
"everyone dies alone," that just
ends up being a slightly

00:12:03.516 --> 00:12:06.539
pretentious way of saying
everyone dies,

00:12:06.539 --> 00:12:09.562
we might say,
oh yeah, that is true and it is

00:12:09.562 --> 00:12:12.379
a necessary truth,
but it's not especially

00:12:12.379 --> 00:12:14.892
surprising.
It's not some deep surprising

00:12:14.892 --> 00:12:16.630
insight into the nature of
death.

00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:20.112
We all knew everyone dies.
You take that familiar fact and

00:12:20.112 --> 00:12:22.870
you wrap it up in the language
"everyone dies alone."

00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:26.499
If that's all you're saying,
you're not saying anything

00:12:26.499 --> 00:12:28.531
interesting.
When people say,

00:12:28.531 --> 00:12:32.146
"You know, everyone dies
alone," you're supposed to be

00:12:32.146 --> 00:12:35.830
gaining some deep insight into
the nature of death.

00:12:35.830 --> 00:12:41.903
Finally, "everyone dies alone"
is supposed to say something

00:12:41.903 --> 00:12:46.529
special about death.
It better not be that everyone

00:12:46.529 --> 00:12:49.337
does everything alone,
because--in whatever the

00:12:49.337 --> 00:12:52.303
relevant sense of alone turns
out to be--if everyone does

00:12:52.303 --> 00:12:54.639
everything alone,
then of course that might be

00:12:54.639 --> 00:12:56.619
interesting.
It might be very important and

00:12:56.619 --> 00:12:59.410
insightful, but you're not
saying anything especially

00:12:59.410 --> 00:13:02.629
interesting about death when you
say everyone dies alone,

00:13:02.629 --> 00:13:06.919
if it's also true that everyone
eats their lunch alone.

00:13:06.919 --> 00:13:09.817
So, all this is,
is just, as we begin to ask

00:13:09.817 --> 00:13:13.388
ourselves, what could it
possible mean when people say

00:13:13.388 --> 00:13:17.401
"everyone dies alone"?
we're looking for something

00:13:17.401 --> 00:13:20.668
that's true, necessary,
interesting and,

00:13:20.668 --> 00:13:24.269
if not unique to death,
at least not true of

00:13:24.269 --> 00:13:26.982
everything.
I put these conditions down

00:13:26.982 --> 00:13:29.220
because, of course,
what I want to suggest is

00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:31.610
although the sentence "everyone
dies alone,"

00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:35.326
the claim that everyone dies
alone, is one of these things

00:13:35.326 --> 00:13:38.232
that people say,
they're not really thinking

00:13:38.232 --> 00:13:40.669
very hard about what they mean
by it.

00:13:40.669 --> 00:13:45.083
Because once you actually push
people, to pin them down,

00:13:45.083 --> 00:13:48.307
what do you mean by it,
you end up with something

00:13:48.307 --> 00:13:50.596
that's either just not true,
or not interesting,

00:13:50.596 --> 00:13:53.398
or not necessary,
or not particularly unique to

00:13:53.398 --> 00:13:56.509
death.
Take a possible interpretation.

00:13:56.509 --> 00:13:59.452
The most natural,
straightforward,

00:13:59.452 --> 00:14:02.840
literal, flat-footed
interpretation.

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:09.494
To say that somebody does
something alone means they do it

00:14:09.494 --> 00:14:15.497
not in the presence of others.
Somebody who lives by himself

00:14:15.497 --> 00:14:18.773
goes to sleep.
If there's nobody else in the

00:14:18.773 --> 00:14:22.580
bedroom, he's sleeping alone.
On that straightforward

00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:25.487
interpretation,
to say that everybody dies

00:14:25.487 --> 00:14:30.025
alone, what we're saying is that
it's true of each one of us that

00:14:30.025 --> 00:14:33.570
he or she dies not in the
presence of others.

00:14:33.570 --> 00:14:36.767
If that was true,
it would be sort of surprising,

00:14:36.767 --> 00:14:38.438
striking.
We might wonder whether it's a

00:14:38.438 --> 00:14:40.407
necessary truth.
But at least there'd be

00:14:40.407 --> 00:14:44.149
something interesting there.
But of course, it's not true.

00:14:44.149 --> 00:14:48.382
We all know full well that
sometimes people die in the

00:14:48.382 --> 00:14:51.928
presence of others.
We read earlier this semester

00:14:51.928 --> 00:14:55.343
Plato's Phaedo,
which describes the death scene

00:14:55.343 --> 00:14:59.270
of Socrates.
Socrates drinks the hemlock and

00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:04.140
dies in the presence of his
friends and disciples.

00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:07.738
Socrates does not die alone.
And of course,

00:15:07.738 --> 00:15:10.610
we know that there are many,
many other cases in which

00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:12.939
people die in the presence of
their friends,

00:15:12.939 --> 00:15:15.872
family, loved ones.
It's just not true,

00:15:15.872 --> 00:15:20.340
given that interpretation,
to say we all die alone.

00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:24.500
So if that's what the claim
means, it's false.

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:30.100
Our challenge is to find some
other interpretation of the

00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:32.549
claim.
All right, second possibility.

00:15:32.549 --> 00:15:36.600
When people say "everyone dies
alone," they don't mean to be

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:39.414
saying you die,
but not in the presence of

00:15:39.414 --> 00:15:42.915
others.
They mean to be saying rather,

00:15:42.915 --> 00:15:48.405
even if there are others around
you, even if there are others

00:15:48.405 --> 00:15:53.530
with you, dying is something
that you're doing alone.

00:15:53.530 --> 00:15:56.701
They aren't dying.
Socrates' friends and disciples

00:15:56.701 --> 00:15:59.889
are not dying.
He's the only one dying.

00:15:59.889 --> 00:16:03.169
And so everyone dies alone in
that sense.

00:16:03.169 --> 00:16:06.109
Well, that's an interesting
claim, if it's true,

00:16:06.109 --> 00:16:09.470
but it's not true.
We could certainly have

00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:14.332
battlefields in which many
people are dying along with

00:16:14.332 --> 00:16:16.367
others.
There is Jones dying,

00:16:16.367 --> 00:16:21.047
but he's not dying alone.
There's Smith dying at the same

00:16:21.047 --> 00:16:25.520
time right next to him.
If that's what people mean when

00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:29.174
they say "everyone dies alone,"
then that's clearly false as

00:16:29.174 --> 00:16:30.974
well.
I presume that's not what

00:16:30.974 --> 00:16:34.222
people meant either.
But then what was it that they

00:16:34.222 --> 00:16:36.169
did mean?
Well, we could do better.

00:16:36.169 --> 00:16:40.501
We could say,
look, when Socrates dies,

00:16:40.501 --> 00:16:47.570
he's dying alone in the sense
that he's doing it by himself.

00:16:47.570 --> 00:16:50.674
He's not doing it in
cooperation with anybody else,

00:16:50.674 --> 00:16:52.909
in coordination with anybody
else.

00:16:52.909 --> 00:16:56.885
On the battlefield,
even if Smith and Jones are

00:16:56.885 --> 00:17:01.898
both dying, it's not like this
is some sort of cooperative,

00:17:01.898 --> 00:17:05.123
joint undertaking.
You could be walking down the

00:17:05.123 --> 00:17:07.680
sidewalk and Linda could be
walking down the sidewalk and

00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:10.099
even though you're both walking
down the sidewalk,

00:17:10.099 --> 00:17:14.160
you're not walking down the
sidewalk together.

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:17.751
In contrast,
you can walk down the sidewalk

00:17:17.751 --> 00:17:20.600
with somebody.
Say, "Hey, let's go to the

00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:23.352
library."
And you walk down the sidewalk

00:17:23.352 --> 00:17:27.051
together.
Walking is something you can do

00:17:27.051 --> 00:17:32.515
with others, in the sense that
it can be a joint activity,

00:17:32.515 --> 00:17:36.913
a joint undertaking.
Perhaps the claim then is that

00:17:36.913 --> 00:17:41.373
dying is not something that can
be done in that way as a joint

00:17:41.373 --> 00:17:43.926
undertaking.
Even if you're in a room or a

00:17:43.926 --> 00:17:46.940
battlefield where people are
dying at the same time as you,

00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:51.748
to your left and your right,
dying is not and cannot be

00:17:51.748 --> 00:17:55.309
something that is a joint
undertaking.

00:17:55.309 --> 00:17:58.185
Well, that might be a proposal
about what people mean when they

00:17:58.185 --> 00:18:00.887
say "everybody dies alone."
And if it is,

00:18:00.887 --> 00:18:05.379
all I can say is,
again, it just seems to be

00:18:05.379 --> 00:18:08.172
false.
Now admittedly,

00:18:08.172 --> 00:18:15.579
dying as a joint undertaking is
far rarer than dying alone.

00:18:15.579 --> 00:18:17.965
But for all that,
we were looking for some deep

00:18:17.965 --> 00:18:19.780
insight into the nature of
death.

00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:23.589
Everyone dies alone.
Everyone must die alone.

00:18:23.589 --> 00:18:28.574
That's only going to be true if
dying as a joint undertaking is

00:18:28.574 --> 00:18:32.039
impossible.
But it's not impossible.

00:18:32.039 --> 00:18:35.348
You could have,
for example,

00:18:35.348 --> 00:18:40.773
some sort of suicide pact.
There have been cases,

00:18:40.773 --> 00:18:45.215
gruesome as they may be,
in which entire groups of

00:18:45.215 --> 00:18:50.200
people drink poison together so
as to die not alone,

00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:54.892
but die together,
die as part of jointly dying,

00:18:54.892 --> 00:18:58.594
dying as a group.
Or you could have,

00:18:58.594 --> 00:19:02.613
once told that this sort of
thing happens,

00:19:02.613 --> 00:19:07.710
a couple in love who together
jump off the cliff,

00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:14.205
committing suicide together,
dying not alone but with each

00:19:14.205 --> 00:19:18.650
other as part of a joint
undertaking.

00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:22.079
It certainly seems possible.
I take it cases like this

00:19:22.079 --> 00:19:25.200
actually do occur.
So if somebody comes along and

00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:26.878
says "No, no,
everybody dies alone,

00:19:26.878 --> 00:19:29.789
and dying as part of a joint
undertaking is impossible,"

00:19:29.789 --> 00:19:32.519
they're just saying something
false.

00:19:32.519 --> 00:19:37.411
These joint undertakings are
like, well, you might think of

00:19:37.411 --> 00:19:41.797
them analogous to playing
chamber music with a string

00:19:41.797 --> 00:19:44.753
quartet.
It's something you're doing

00:19:44.753 --> 00:19:46.902
with others.
It's not just a coincidence

00:19:46.902 --> 00:19:48.700
that they're doing it at the
same time.

00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:51.144
All these people happen to be
playing the violin,

00:19:51.144 --> 00:19:53.079
viola, or what have you next to
you.

00:19:53.079 --> 00:19:57.807
No, no, we deliberately
coordinated with one another so

00:19:57.807 --> 00:20:00.960
as to together produce this
music.

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:04.369
It seems possible in the case
of string quartets.

00:20:04.369 --> 00:20:10.799
It seems possible in the case
of joint suicide pacts as well.

00:20:10.799 --> 00:20:13.928
Well, a fan of the claim that
we all die alone might come back

00:20:13.928 --> 00:20:18.353
and say, "Well,
in the case of the string

00:20:18.353 --> 00:20:26.740
quartet, although it's true that
I am playing with others,

00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:32.731
somebody could take my part.
Somebody else could play the

00:20:32.731 --> 00:20:37.085
second violin part for me.
Whereas, in contrast,

00:20:37.085 --> 00:20:43.184
when I die, even if I'm dying
with others, nobody can take my

00:20:43.184 --> 00:20:45.775
part."
So perhaps that's what the

00:20:45.775 --> 00:20:49.769
claim is meant to be when people
say, "everybody dies alone."

00:20:49.769 --> 00:20:55.510
Nobody can die your death for
you.

00:20:55.510 --> 00:21:01.030
Nobody can take your part.
Now if that's what they mean,

00:21:01.030 --> 00:21:05.342
then--a small observation--they
didn't express themselves very

00:21:05.342 --> 00:21:08.113
clearly.
It seems to me rather a long

00:21:08.113 --> 00:21:11.601
distance from the thought,
"nobody can die for me,

00:21:11.601 --> 00:21:15.445
nobody can take my part," to
the claim, "everybody dies

00:21:15.445 --> 00:21:17.795
alone."
That seems a rather misleading,

00:21:17.795 --> 00:21:19.579
unhelpful, way of making your
point.

00:21:19.579 --> 00:21:22.359
But let's just bracket that
complaint.

00:21:22.359 --> 00:21:26.059
It is true that nobody can take
my part?

00:21:26.059 --> 00:21:29.589
Certainly people can take my
part in the string quartet.

00:21:29.589 --> 00:21:33.840
Is it true that nobody can take
my part in terms of my death?

00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:38.932
Not so clear it is true.
I don't know how many of you

00:21:38.932 --> 00:21:41.009
have read Tale of Two
Cities.

00:21:41.009 --> 00:21:44.500
If not, I'm about to spoil the
plot for you.

00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:48.559
Here's at least a strand of the
story.

00:21:48.559 --> 00:21:53.438
The hero of the story is in
love with a woman who--alas and

00:21:53.438 --> 00:21:58.720
alack--does not love him.
She loves another man.

00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:03.312
This other man--alas and
alack--has been condemned to

00:22:03.312 --> 00:22:06.579
death during the French
Revolution.

00:22:06.579 --> 00:22:11.277
Now as it happens--this is a
novel--as it happens,

00:22:11.277 --> 00:22:15.400
our hero looks rather like the
other man.

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:21.056
And so as the other man is
being carted off to the

00:22:21.056 --> 00:22:27.059
guillotine to be killed,
our hero takes his place.

00:22:27.059 --> 00:22:31.698
Hence, the famous speech,
"Tis a far, far better thing I

00:22:31.698 --> 00:22:35.278
do today."
Our hero sacrifices himself so

00:22:35.278 --> 00:22:40.160
that the woman he loves can have
the man that she loves.

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:42.950
Well, for our purposes,
the romance isn't crucial.

00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:46.612
For our purposes,
the crucial point is to see

00:22:46.612 --> 00:22:51.690
that what seems to be going on
there is our hero is taking the

00:22:51.690 --> 00:22:55.519
place of somebody else who's
about to die.

00:22:55.519 --> 00:23:00.807
Just like somebody could take
my place in the string quartet,

00:23:00.807 --> 00:23:06.359
it seems that somebody could
take my place at the guillotine.

00:23:06.359 --> 00:23:10.343
In the American Civil War,
there was a draft,

00:23:10.343 --> 00:23:15.141
but you could avoid it by
hiring somebody to take your

00:23:15.141 --> 00:23:19.828
place, if you were rich enough.
Well, you're in some battle,

00:23:19.828 --> 00:23:22.758
or rather, your troop is in
some battle, and people are

00:23:22.758 --> 00:23:25.642
being killed left and right.
Well, I suppose it doesn't

00:23:25.642 --> 00:23:28.277
strike me as an implausible
thing to say that if everybody

00:23:28.277 --> 00:23:31.190
in the troop got killed and you
would have gotten killed had you

00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:32.639
been there,
but instead,

00:23:32.639 --> 00:23:35.654
the person you hired to take
your place gets killed,

00:23:35.654 --> 00:23:40.238
then he took your place.
He substituted for you in the

00:23:40.238 --> 00:23:42.765
death.
So again, we don't have any

00:23:42.765 --> 00:23:46.711
clear, true interpretation of
the claim that nobody can take

00:23:46.711 --> 00:23:49.319
my place, even with regard to
dying.

00:23:49.319 --> 00:23:53.819
Well, easy to imagine the fan
of this view coming back yet

00:23:53.819 --> 00:23:57.652
again and saying,
"Although it's true that our

00:23:57.652 --> 00:24:02.400
hero takes the place of the
other man on the guillotine,

00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:07.561
what ends up happening,
of course, is that our hero

00:24:07.561 --> 00:24:13.380
dies his own death.
He doesn't take over the death

00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:17.430
of the other man.
The death of the other man

00:24:17.430 --> 00:24:21.006
doesn't take place until 20,30,
40, whatever it is,

00:24:21.006 --> 00:24:25.866
years later.
Nobody can take my place at

00:24:25.866 --> 00:24:29.786
my death.
Because, of course,

00:24:29.786 --> 00:24:33.748
if they take my place,
they end up living or going

00:24:33.748 --> 00:24:36.821
through, rather,
their death not

00:24:36.821 --> 00:24:42.169
my death.
My death is something that only

00:24:42.169 --> 00:24:46.359
I can undergo.
Now again, that's an

00:24:46.359 --> 00:24:50.404
interesting claim if it's true.
At least it seems to be an

00:24:50.404 --> 00:24:52.605
interesting claim.
It seems to say something

00:24:52.605 --> 00:24:55.639
interesting about death.
Again, I want to just notice

00:24:55.639 --> 00:24:59.958
that it's a rather odd thing to
try to express that point in the

00:24:59.958 --> 00:25:03.960
language "everyone dies alone."
But just bracket that.

00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:07.092
Have we at least found
something interesting,

00:25:07.092 --> 00:25:11.576
necessary, unique to death when
we say, "Nobody can die my death

00:25:11.576 --> 00:25:14.973
for me.
I am the only one who can

00:25:14.973 --> 00:25:19.605
undergo my death"?
Each of us must undergo his own

00:25:19.605 --> 00:25:24.946
death and nobody else's death.
Nobody else can undergo their

00:25:24.946 --> 00:25:29.410
death for them,
somebody else's death for them.

00:25:29.410 --> 00:25:34.917
Well, that does seem to be true
and it seems to be a necessary

00:25:34.917 --> 00:25:37.710
truth.
But we're not quite done.

00:25:37.710 --> 00:25:42.351
Is it saying something deep and
interesting about the nature of

00:25:42.351 --> 00:25:45.018
death?
Is it something that's fairly

00:25:45.018 --> 00:25:50.722
unique to the nature of death?
That nobody can die my death

00:25:50.722 --> 00:25:54.849
for me.
Actually, I don't think it is.

00:25:54.849 --> 00:26:00.009
Consider getting your hair cut
at the barber.

00:26:00.009 --> 00:26:03.717
Now of course,
somebody else can take your

00:26:03.717 --> 00:26:05.365
slot.
All right, there's somebody who

00:26:05.365 --> 00:26:07.070
comes along and says,
"Oh, I need to get to a date.

00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:09.437
I'm going to be late.
Would you mind my having your

00:26:09.437 --> 00:26:10.980
appointment, using your
appointment?"

00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:13.420
"Oh, I'm willing to wait.
It's okay," right?

00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:17.033
So you might say,
in some loose sense they've

00:26:17.033 --> 00:26:19.655
gotten your haircut.
But of course,

00:26:19.655 --> 00:26:21.810
as it ended up,
they didn't really get

00:26:21.810 --> 00:26:26.810
your haircut.
They got their haircut.

00:26:26.810 --> 00:26:31.817
Think about haircuts.
Nobody can get my

00:26:31.817 --> 00:26:37.166
haircut for me.
I'm the only one who can get

00:26:37.166 --> 00:26:41.999
my haircut.
If somebody else tries to get

00:26:41.999 --> 00:26:46.605
my haircut, they just end up
getting their own

00:26:46.605 --> 00:26:49.089
haircut.
Of course, it's not just

00:26:49.089 --> 00:26:54.395
special about haircuts.
Talk about getting your kidney

00:26:54.395 --> 00:26:58.164
stones removed.
Nobody else can get my

00:26:58.164 --> 00:27:02.302
kidney stones removed for me.
I'm the only one who can get my

00:27:02.302 --> 00:27:05.640
kidney stones removed for me.
Think about eating lunch.

00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:08.519
Nobody can eat my lunch
for me.

00:27:08.519 --> 00:27:10.946
If somebody else tries to eat
my lunch, they end up--it

00:27:10.946 --> 00:27:13.657
becomes their lunch.
They've eaten their lunch for

00:27:13.657 --> 00:27:17.266
themselves.
Nobody can eat my lunch for me

00:27:17.266 --> 00:27:20.301
except for me.
If you think about it,

00:27:20.301 --> 00:27:23.000
it's true about just about
everything.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:27.940
Maybe indeed everything.
If you emphasize the word "my"

00:27:27.940 --> 00:27:34.705
enough, nobody can do much of
anything for me and still have

00:27:34.705 --> 00:27:41.064
it be my such and such.
In short, even though it's true

00:27:41.064 --> 00:27:46.380
that nobody can die my death for
me, this isn't some deep insight

00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:49.369
into the special nature of
death.

00:27:49.369 --> 00:27:54.592
It's just a trivial grammatical
point about the meaning of the

00:27:54.592 --> 00:27:55.620
word "my."

00:28:00.089 --> 00:28:02.200
All right, remember where we're
at.

00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:06.543
We're looking for
interpretations of the claim

00:28:06.543 --> 00:28:11.218
"everyone dies alone."
And by now we've gone rather

00:28:11.218 --> 00:28:16.440
far afield in the search for an
interpretation of that claim.

00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:20.563
But we have not yet been able
to find a claim,

00:28:20.563 --> 00:28:23.769
an interpretation,
which is true,

00:28:23.769 --> 00:28:27.190
interesting,
fairly special about death,

00:28:27.190 --> 00:28:31.400
as opposed to trivially true
about everything,

00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:35.906
and giving us some relatively
interesting insight into the

00:28:35.906 --> 00:28:40.596
nature of death.
I can't see it for the claim

00:28:40.596 --> 00:28:45.806
"everyone dies alone."
At least not if we try to take

00:28:45.806 --> 00:28:50.858
these claims fairly literally or
take them to be metaphysical

00:28:50.858 --> 00:28:53.890
claims about the nature of
death.

00:28:53.890 --> 00:28:57.914
But maybe I've just been
flatfooted here in thinking that

00:28:57.914 --> 00:29:01.795
this is some sort of claim about
not being with others,

00:29:01.795 --> 00:29:06.591
or things I do by myself.
Maybe the claim "we all die

00:29:06.591 --> 00:29:10.809
alone" is intended as a kind of
metaphor.

00:29:10.809 --> 00:29:14.589
It's not that we all really do
die alone.

00:29:14.589 --> 00:29:19.283
It's that when we die,
it's as though we were

00:29:19.283 --> 00:29:22.869
alone.
It's like being alone.

00:29:22.869 --> 00:29:29.260
Maybe the claim "we all die
alone" is a psychological claim,

00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:36.085
that the psychological state we
are in when we die is similar to

00:29:36.085 --> 00:29:40.856
loneliness.
It's similar to the feeling of

00:29:40.856 --> 00:29:45.890
being alone that we have in
various situations.

00:29:49.890 --> 00:29:53.700
Now, that would be interesting
if it was true.

00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:58.410
Is it true that when we die we
all die having this feeling of

00:29:58.410 --> 00:30:02.099
loneliness, or perhaps feeling
of alienation?

00:30:02.099 --> 00:30:07.759
It's easy enough to imagine
somebody who is surrounded by

00:30:07.759 --> 00:30:13.179
other people as he's dying.
And yet, for all that,

00:30:13.179 --> 00:30:17.817
feels removed,
distant, alienated from the

00:30:17.817 --> 00:30:22.570
others, feels lonely even in the
crowd.

00:30:22.570 --> 00:30:26.448
Is that true of all of us?
Remember, we're looking for a

00:30:26.448 --> 00:30:28.099
claim that says,
that makes it true,

00:30:28.099 --> 00:30:33.329
that everyone dies alone.
Is it true that everyone dies

00:30:33.329 --> 00:30:39.050
feeling distant and removed?
Maybe it was true of Ivan

00:30:39.050 --> 00:30:42.588
Ilyich.
Ivan Ilyich progressively grows

00:30:42.588 --> 00:30:47.646
more and more distant from his
family and friends who,

00:30:47.646 --> 00:30:52.799
indeed, remove themselves
psychologically from him.

00:30:52.799 --> 00:30:58.785
He faces his death with a
feeling of alienation and being

00:30:58.785 --> 00:31:00.712
alone.
It's a metaphor,

00:31:00.712 --> 00:31:04.200
but still an important insight
into his psychology.

00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:07.400
The question we have to ask is,
"Is that true of everybody?

00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:12.409
Is it true that everybody dies
alone in this psychological

00:31:12.409 --> 00:31:15.835
sense?"
It doesn't seem to be

00:31:15.835 --> 00:31:17.381
true.
First of all,

00:31:17.381 --> 00:31:21.762
notice the obvious point that
sometimes people die in their

00:31:21.762 --> 00:31:24.200
sleep, unexpectedly.
They weren't ill.

00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:26.750
They just die of cardiac arrest
while they're sleeping.

00:31:26.750 --> 00:31:33.686
Such a person presumably is not
feeling lonely or alienated

00:31:33.686 --> 00:31:36.869
while he dies.
Well, you might say,

00:31:36.869 --> 00:31:40.425
"Okay, what we meant was
anybody who's awake while

00:31:40.425 --> 00:31:42.330
they're dying,
dies alone."

00:31:42.330 --> 00:31:45.440
That's not true either.
You're crossing the street,

00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:49.039
talking to your friend,
engaged in lively discussion.

00:31:49.039 --> 00:31:53.390
So lively, you don't notice the
truck that's about to hit you.

00:31:53.390 --> 00:31:56.832
The truck hits you,
you die, painlessly and

00:31:56.832 --> 00:31:59.733
immediately.
Well, were you feeling

00:31:59.733 --> 00:32:03.640
alienated and distant during
your final moments?

00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:05.970
No, it doesn't seem right
either.

00:32:05.970 --> 00:32:10.416
So it certainly doesn't seem
true to say that everybody dies

00:32:10.416 --> 00:32:14.410
feeling these psychological
feelings of loneliness.

00:32:14.410 --> 00:32:16.854
Well, maybe what we should have
to do is revise the claim yet

00:32:16.854 --> 00:32:19.185
again.
Everybody who dies awake,

00:32:19.185 --> 00:32:23.758
realizing that they're dying,
facing the fact that they're

00:32:23.758 --> 00:32:27.211
dying,
they all, we all of whom that's

00:32:27.211 --> 00:32:31.616
true, we all die alone,
as long as we realize we're

00:32:31.616 --> 00:32:33.254
dying.
That would take care of the

00:32:33.254 --> 00:32:34.571
sleep case.
That would take care of the

00:32:34.571 --> 00:32:37.150
truck case.
Is the claim true then?

00:32:37.150 --> 00:32:39.130
It would still be interesting
if it was true,

00:32:39.130 --> 00:32:43.501
even given those restrictions.
But it doesn't seem true then

00:32:43.501 --> 00:32:46.529
either.
Again, just recall Socrates.

00:32:46.529 --> 00:32:50.898
Socrates is engaged in
philosophical discussion with

00:32:50.898 --> 00:32:54.240
his friends, knows he's about to
die.

00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:57.435
He's drunk the hemlock.
He's sitting there saying

00:32:57.435 --> 00:33:02.859
goodbye to everybody.
He doesn't seem alienated.

00:33:02.859 --> 00:33:05.980
He doesn't seem to be feeling
distant and alone.

00:33:05.980 --> 00:33:11.135
It just doesn't seem true that
everybody who knows they're

00:33:11.135 --> 00:33:16.019
going to die and is facing their
death feels lonely.

00:33:16.019 --> 00:33:18.531
Another example of this is
another philosopher,

00:33:18.531 --> 00:33:21.260
David Hume, whom we'll be
reading at the end of the

00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:23.229
semester.
We'll be reading his essay on

00:33:23.229 --> 00:33:27.349
suicide.
Hume died, had an illness.

00:33:27.349 --> 00:33:29.759
He was quite sociable to the
end.

00:33:29.759 --> 00:33:32.740
He used to bring people in to
sit around his deathbed talking

00:33:32.740 --> 00:33:37.573
about various matters with him.
He was cheerful and pleasant to

00:33:37.573 --> 00:33:39.383
the end.
And there's,

00:33:39.383 --> 00:33:42.842
as far as I can see,
no reason at all to believe

00:33:42.842 --> 00:33:46.640
that he was feeling lonely,
feeling distant,

00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:51.906
feeling alienated from the
people who were keeping him

00:33:51.906 --> 00:33:55.706
company.
So the psychological reading

00:33:55.706 --> 00:33:59.960
doesn't do any better,
as far as I can see.

00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:02.763
Well, maybe there's some other
interpretation,

00:34:02.763 --> 00:34:05.630
and I invite you to reflect on
the question.

00:34:05.630 --> 00:34:08.980
Is it true that we all die
alone?

00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:13.597
Is there some way of
understanding that claim where

00:34:13.597 --> 00:34:18.087
it's true, a necessary truth,
fairly special and unique,

00:34:18.087 --> 00:34:21.466
if not altogether unique,
at least fairly special about

00:34:21.466 --> 00:34:24.375
death,
showing us some deep insight

00:34:24.375 --> 00:34:29.318
into the nature of death--as
opposed to some trivial insight

00:34:29.318 --> 00:34:34.680
about the way the possessive
first person pronoun "my" works?

00:34:34.680 --> 00:34:39.048
I can't find it.
So despite the fact that the

00:34:39.048 --> 00:34:44.117
claim "we all die alone" is one
of these things that one hears,

00:34:44.117 --> 00:34:49.278
I think it's just nonsense.
I think it's people talking

00:34:49.278 --> 00:34:54.895
without giving a moment's
thought to what they meant when

00:34:54.895 --> 00:35:00.150
they said it.
All right, where are we?

00:35:00.150 --> 00:35:05.066
For the first half of the
course, we've been engaged in

00:35:05.066 --> 00:35:10.742
metaphysics, broadly speaking.
We've been trying to get clear

00:35:10.742 --> 00:35:15.900
about the nature of the person,
what we're composed of,

00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:20.356
so that we could then try to
get clearer about the nature of

00:35:20.356 --> 00:35:23.000
survival and identity of
persons,

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:26.943
so that we could think about
the nature of death,

00:35:26.943 --> 00:35:33.750
metaphysically speaking.
What happens when we die?

00:35:33.750 --> 00:35:37.886
And as you know,
I've defended the physicalist

00:35:37.886 --> 00:35:43.034
conception, according to which
all we are are just bodies

00:35:43.034 --> 00:35:46.620
capable of doing some fancy
tricks,

00:35:46.620 --> 00:35:52.031
capable of P-functioning.
And details aside,

00:35:52.031 --> 00:35:58.645
death is a matter of the body
breaking, so that it's no longer

00:35:58.645 --> 00:36:03.199
able to engage in
P-functioning.

00:36:03.199 --> 00:36:07.677
As we saw, depending on the
particular details of which

00:36:07.677 --> 00:36:12.320
theory of personal identity you
accept--the body view,

00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:15.031
the brain view,
the personality theory of

00:36:15.031 --> 00:36:19.369
personal identity--we might have
to say slightly different things

00:36:19.369 --> 00:36:23.639
about whether the death of my
body means I no longer exist,

00:36:23.639 --> 00:36:25.944
whether we should distinguish
the death of the body,

00:36:25.944 --> 00:36:29.099
the death of the person,
and so forth.

00:36:29.099 --> 00:36:32.922
But those details aside,
roughly speaking,

00:36:32.922 --> 00:36:37.902
the following is true.
When the body breaks,

00:36:37.902 --> 00:36:43.829
I cease to exist as a person.
And even if we can hold out the

00:36:43.829 --> 00:36:47.912
logical possibility of my being
resurrected--or my continuing to

00:36:47.912 --> 00:36:52.190
exist with a different body as
long as it's got my personality,

00:36:52.190 --> 00:36:56.329
if you happen to accept the
personality theory--even though

00:36:56.329 --> 00:37:00.826
there is the logical possibility
of surviving my death or coming

00:37:00.826 --> 00:37:05.478
back to life,
I see no good reason to believe

00:37:05.478 --> 00:37:10.469
that those logical possibilities
are actual.

00:37:10.469 --> 00:37:14.680
As far as I can see,
when my body dies,

00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:17.648
that's it.
As a fan of the body view,

00:37:17.648 --> 00:37:20.170
I believe I'll still exist for
a while.

00:37:20.170 --> 00:37:23.251
I'll exist as a corpse.
But that's not the kind of

00:37:23.251 --> 00:37:25.750
thing about existence that
mattered to me.

00:37:25.750 --> 00:37:29.618
In terms of what mattered to
me, what I wanted was not just

00:37:29.618 --> 00:37:32.019
that I exist,
but that I be alive,

00:37:32.019 --> 00:37:35.774
indeed be a person,
indeed be a person with pretty

00:37:35.774 --> 00:37:39.505
much the same personality.
And the truth of the matter is,

00:37:39.505 --> 00:37:41.500
when my body dies,
that's all history.

00:37:44.570 --> 00:37:47.580
That's where we're at in terms
of the metaphysics.

00:37:50.730 --> 00:37:55.103
We could summarize this by
saying, when I die,

00:37:55.103 --> 00:37:58.880
I cease to exist.
That's a little bit misleading,

00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:02.491
given the view I just sketched
where even though I'm dead I

00:38:02.491 --> 00:38:04.920
still exist for a while as a
corpse.

00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:09.775
But those issues won't concern
us in what we're about to turn

00:38:09.775 --> 00:38:12.414
to.
Let's just suppose that,

00:38:12.414 --> 00:38:16.510
for the sake of avoiding those
complications,

00:38:16.510 --> 00:38:20.699
that when my body dies,
it gets destroyed.

00:38:20.699 --> 00:38:24.291
And so the very same moment
will be the end of my body,

00:38:24.291 --> 00:38:27.750
the end of my existence,
the end of my personhood.

00:38:27.750 --> 00:38:29.779
Let's suppose that my
personality doesn't get

00:38:29.779 --> 00:38:32.039
destroyed any sooner than the
death of my body.

00:38:32.039 --> 00:38:33.780
We've got the end of my
existence.

00:38:33.780 --> 00:38:37.962
Here I am going along.
The atomizer comes along,

00:38:37.962 --> 00:38:40.834
blows me up.
Then simultaneously,

00:38:40.834 --> 00:38:45.031
we've got the death of my
person, the death of my body,

00:38:45.031 --> 00:38:49.540
the end of what matters to me,
the end of my existence.

00:38:49.540 --> 00:38:53.627
Death is the end.
And even though these things

00:38:53.627 --> 00:38:57.331
can come across--can come apart
slightly under certain

00:38:57.331 --> 00:39:00.604
scenarios,
those details won't matter for

00:39:00.604 --> 00:39:05.095
what we're about to turn to.
Well, what are we about to turn

00:39:05.095 --> 00:39:07.192
to?
We're about to turn to value

00:39:07.192 --> 00:39:09.904
theory.
We spent the first half of the

00:39:09.904 --> 00:39:13.780
semester, you might say,
trying to get clear about the

00:39:13.780 --> 00:39:17.843
metaphysical facts.
And now that we've done that as

00:39:17.843 --> 00:39:22.910
best we can, we want to turn to
the ethical or value questions.

00:39:22.910 --> 00:39:28.762
How good or bad is death?
Why is--I take it,

00:39:28.762 --> 00:39:34.010
we all believe death is bad.
Why is death bad?

00:39:34.010 --> 00:39:39.408
How can death be bad?
So this is the big continental

00:39:39.408 --> 00:39:42.257
divide for the course.
The first half of the class was

00:39:42.257 --> 00:39:46.869
metaphysics.
Now we turn to value questions.

00:39:46.869 --> 00:39:52.531
And the first question we're
going to be focusing on is just

00:39:52.531 --> 00:39:56.849
this, the question of the
badness of death.

00:39:56.849 --> 00:40:00.250
How and in what ways is
death bad?

00:40:00.250 --> 00:40:03.190
I take it, most of us do
believe that death is bad.

00:40:03.190 --> 00:40:06.667
That's why we wish--maybe some
of us believe,

00:40:06.667 --> 00:40:09.750
but at the very least the rest
of us,

00:40:09.750 --> 00:40:14.514
many of us hoped--there were
souls, so that death wouldn't

00:40:14.514 --> 00:40:17.857
have to be the end.
If death is the end,

00:40:17.857 --> 00:40:20.989
that seems to be horrible.
So we're going to turn to

00:40:20.989 --> 00:40:25.803
questions like this.
How and in what ways is death

00:40:25.803 --> 00:40:28.186
bad?
And then we're going to turn to

00:40:28.186 --> 00:40:30.102
the question,
is it really true that

00:40:30.102 --> 00:40:32.378
immortality would be good?
And eventually,

00:40:32.378 --> 00:40:35.179
we'll turn to some other value
questions about if death really

00:40:35.179 --> 00:40:37.199
is the end, should we be afraid
of death?

00:40:37.199 --> 00:40:39.579
I take it that fear of death is
quite common.

00:40:39.579 --> 00:40:43.481
But we can actually evaluate
different emotions and think

00:40:43.481 --> 00:40:47.452
about whether these emotional
responses are appropriate or

00:40:47.452 --> 00:40:49.665
not,
so we can ask whether or not

00:40:49.665 --> 00:40:53.754
fear of death is appropriate.
We'll turn eventually to the

00:40:53.754 --> 00:40:58.880
question, how should we live in
light of the fact that death is

00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:01.071
the end?
And the last question we'll

00:41:01.071 --> 00:41:03.730
turn to is, could it ever make
sense to kill ourselves?

00:41:03.730 --> 00:41:06.916
So these are the kind of moral
or value questions we'll be

00:41:06.916 --> 00:41:09.320
concerned with until the end of
the term.

00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:13.284
But the first one is simply,
is death bad,

00:41:13.284 --> 00:41:19.182
as we typically take it to be,
and, if so, what is it about it

00:41:19.182 --> 00:41:23.487
that makes it bad?
So again, I'm going to suppose

00:41:23.487 --> 00:41:27.262
here on out that the
metaphysical view that I've been

00:41:27.262 --> 00:41:30.389
sketching is right;
that physicalism is true.

00:41:30.389 --> 00:41:36.160
The death of my body is the end
of my existence as a person.

00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:43.710
Death is my end.
Well, if that's right,

00:41:43.710 --> 00:41:48.000
how can it be bad for me to
die?

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:53.710
After all, once I'm dead,
I don't exist.

00:41:53.710 --> 00:41:58.794
If I don't exist,
how can it be bad for me that

00:41:58.794 --> 00:42:01.720
I'm dead?
It's easy to see how you might

00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:04.741
think, how you might worry about
the badness of death,

00:42:04.741 --> 00:42:07.820
if you thought you would
survive your death.

00:42:07.820 --> 00:42:10.680
Now, if you believed in a soul,
then you might worry about,

00:42:10.680 --> 00:42:13.590
well, gosh what's going to
happen to my soul after I die?

00:42:13.590 --> 00:42:14.840
Am I going to make it up to
heaven?

00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:18.510
Am I going to go to hell?
You might worry about how badly

00:42:18.510 --> 00:42:21.579
off you're going to be once
you're dead.

00:42:21.579 --> 00:42:23.010
The question makes perfect
sense.

00:42:23.010 --> 00:42:27.150
But it's often seemed to people
that if we really believe that

00:42:27.150 --> 00:42:31.426
death is the end--and that's the
assumption that I'm making here

00:42:31.426 --> 00:42:34.820
on out--if we really believe
death is the end,

00:42:34.820 --> 00:42:40.818
how can death be bad for me?
How could anything be bad for

00:42:40.818 --> 00:42:43.634
me once I'm dead?
If I don't exist,

00:42:43.634 --> 00:42:44.870
it can't be bad for me.

00:42:48.630 --> 00:42:52.715
Well, sometimes in response to
this thought,

00:42:52.715 --> 00:42:57.940
people respond by saying,
"Look, death isn't bad for the

00:42:57.940 --> 00:43:04.560
person who's dead.
Death is bad for the survivors."

00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:10.427
John's death isn't bad for John.
John's death is bad for the

00:43:10.427 --> 00:43:15.776
people who loved John and now
have to continue living without

00:43:15.776 --> 00:43:20.804
John.
John's death is bad for John's

00:43:20.804 --> 00:43:26.046
friends and family.
When somebody dies,

00:43:26.046 --> 00:43:33.519
we lose the chance to continue
interacting with the person.

00:43:33.519 --> 00:43:38.952
We're no longer able to talk
with them, spend time with them,

00:43:38.952 --> 00:43:41.940
watch a movie,
look at the sunset,

00:43:41.940 --> 00:43:44.918
have a laugh.
We're no longer able to tell

00:43:44.918 --> 00:43:47.230
our troubles with them and get
their advice.

00:43:47.230 --> 00:43:50.889
We're no longer able to
interact with them.

00:43:50.889 --> 00:43:56.000
All that's gone,
when somebody dies.

00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:01.022
And the claim might be,
that's the central bad of

00:44:01.022 --> 00:44:04.460
death.
Not what it does for the person

00:44:04.460 --> 00:44:06.933
who dies.
It's not bad for the person who

00:44:06.933 --> 00:44:09.469
dies.
It's what it does for the rest

00:44:09.469 --> 00:44:14.863
of them, the rest of us.
Now, I don't in any way want to

00:44:14.863 --> 00:44:21.721
belittle the importance of the
pain and suffering that happen

00:44:21.721 --> 00:44:28.579
for the rest of us when somebody
that we care about dies.

00:44:28.579 --> 00:44:34.145
Indeed, let me take a moment
and read a poem that emphasizes

00:44:34.145 --> 00:44:38.106
this thought,
because this is certainly one

00:44:38.106 --> 00:44:41.880
central, very bad thing about
death.

00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:46.293
It robs us of our friends--we,
the survivors--it robs us of

00:44:46.293 --> 00:44:49.329
our friends and loved ones.
Poem.

00:44:49.329 --> 00:44:53.192
The poem is called
Separation, by the German

00:44:53.192 --> 00:44:56.050
poet, Friedrich Gottlieb
Klopstock.

00:44:56.050 --> 00:44:59.119
This is in one of the essays
you'll be reading later in the

00:44:59.119 --> 00:45:02.189
semester by Walter Kaufmann--he
quotes it--Death Without

00:45:02.189 --> 00:45:04.199
Dread.
The poem, as I say,

00:45:04.199 --> 00:45:07.786
is Separation.
You turned so serious

00:45:07.786 --> 00:45:11.260
when the corpse
was carried past us;

00:45:11.260 --> 00:45:15.890
are you afraid of death?
"Oh, not of that!"

00:45:15.890 --> 00:45:20.240
Of what are you afraid?
"Of dying."

00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:25.489
I not even of that.
"Then you're afraid of nothing?"

00:45:25.489 --> 00:45:29.947
Alas, I am afraid,
afraid…"Heavens,

00:45:29.947 --> 00:45:33.980
of what?"
Of parting from my friends.

00:45:33.980 --> 00:45:37.958
And not mine only,
of their parting,

00:45:37.958 --> 00:45:40.287
too.
That's why I turned more

00:45:40.287 --> 00:45:42.204
serious even
than you did,

00:45:42.204 --> 00:45:44.789
deeper in the soul,
when the corpse

00:45:44.789 --> 00:45:47.530
was carried past us [Kaufmann
1976]

00:45:47.530 --> 00:45:49.679
The poem is called
Separation.

00:45:49.679 --> 00:45:54.319
According to Klopstock,
the crucial badness of death is

00:45:54.319 --> 00:45:59.750
losing your friends.
When they die, you lose them.

00:45:59.750 --> 00:46:03.144
And as I say,
I don't in any way want to

00:46:03.144 --> 00:46:06.539
belittle the central badness of
that.

00:46:06.539 --> 00:46:11.517
But I don't think it can be at
the core in terms of what's bad

00:46:11.517 --> 00:46:14.843
about death.
I don't think that can be the

00:46:14.843 --> 00:46:17.630
central fact about why death is
bad.

00:46:17.630 --> 00:46:21.520
And to see this,
let me tell you two stories.

00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:25.550
Compare them.
Story number one.

00:46:25.550 --> 00:46:32.086
Your friend is about to go on
the spaceship which is going to

00:46:32.086 --> 00:46:36.880
do the exploration of Jupiter or
whatever.

00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:41.099
And they're going to be gone
for years, years and years.

00:46:41.099 --> 00:46:47.183
It takes so long that by the
time the spaceship comes back,

00:46:47.183 --> 00:46:50.830
100 years will have gone by.
Maybe it's not Jupiter.

00:46:50.830 --> 00:46:54.718
It's farther away.
Worse still,

00:46:54.718 --> 00:46:59.293
after about 20 minutes after
the ship takes off,

00:46:59.293 --> 00:47:05.329
all radio contact between ship
and earth will be destroyed.

00:47:05.329 --> 00:47:07.050
It won't be possible,
because of the speed.

00:47:07.050 --> 00:47:09.325
It's not going to Jupiter.
It's going to some other

00:47:09.325 --> 00:47:11.813
planetary system.
So, all possibility of

00:47:11.813 --> 00:47:15.559
communication will be destroyed.
Now, this is horrible.

00:47:15.559 --> 00:47:19.440
You're losing your closest
friend.

00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:22.533
You will no longer be able to
talk to them,

00:47:22.533 --> 00:47:26.289
share the moments,
get their insights and advice.

00:47:26.289 --> 00:47:29.138
You'll no longer be able to
tell them about the things that

00:47:29.138 --> 00:47:32.044
have been going on.
It's the same kind of

00:47:32.044 --> 00:47:36.060
separation that Klopstock was
talking about.

00:47:36.060 --> 00:47:40.059
Horrible, and it's sad.
That was story number one.

00:47:40.059 --> 00:47:43.315
Story number two,
just like story number one,

00:47:43.315 --> 00:47:47.309
the spaceship takes off,
and about 15 minutes later,

00:47:47.309 --> 00:47:52.947
it explodes in a horrible
accident and everybody on the

00:47:52.947 --> 00:47:57.750
spaceship, including your
friend, is killed.

00:47:57.750 --> 00:48:03.170
Now, I take it that story
number two is worse.

00:48:03.170 --> 00:48:08.590
Something worse has taken place.
Well, what's the worse thing?

00:48:08.590 --> 00:48:12.924
We've got of course the very
same separation we had in story

00:48:12.924 --> 00:48:14.866
number one.
I can't communicate in the

00:48:14.866 --> 00:48:17.030
future with my friend.
They can't communicate with me.

00:48:17.030 --> 00:48:20.280
But we had that already in
story number one.

00:48:20.280 --> 00:48:23.900
If there's something worse
about story number two,

00:48:23.900 --> 00:48:27.890
and I think it's pretty clear
there is something worse,

00:48:27.890 --> 00:48:33.383
it's not the separation.
It's something about the fact

00:48:33.383 --> 00:48:37.622
that your friend has died.
Now of course,

00:48:37.622 --> 00:48:41.455
this is worse for me,
as somebody who cares about my

00:48:41.455 --> 00:48:46.219
friend, that he's died.
But the explanation of what's

00:48:46.219 --> 00:48:51.646
bad for me, in his having died,
is the fact that it's bad

00:48:51.646 --> 00:48:56.929
for him to have died.
And the badness for him isn't

00:48:56.929 --> 00:49:01.489
just a matter of separation,
because that we already had in

00:49:01.489 --> 00:49:03.582
number one.
We couldn't communicate with

00:49:03.582 --> 00:49:07.000
him.
He couldn't communicate with us.

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:11.644
If we want to get at the
central badness of death,

00:49:11.644 --> 00:49:15.815
it seems to me,
we can't focus on the badness

00:49:15.815 --> 00:49:20.460
of separation,
the badness for the survivors.

00:49:20.460 --> 00:49:26.257
We have to think about how is
it, how could it be true,

00:49:26.257 --> 00:49:31.840
that death is bad for the
person that dies?

00:49:31.840 --> 00:49:37.057
That's the central badness of
death and that's the one I'm

00:49:37.057 --> 00:49:43.277
going to have us focus on.
How could it be true that death

00:49:43.277 --> 00:49:49.240
is bad for the person that dies?
That's the question we turn to

00:49:49.240 --> 00:49:50.240
next time.

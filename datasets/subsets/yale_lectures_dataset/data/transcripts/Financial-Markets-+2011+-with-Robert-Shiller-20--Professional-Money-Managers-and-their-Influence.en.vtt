PROFESSOR ROBERT SHILLER:
All right.

00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:06.240
Well, we're talking about
institutional investors today.

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.110
I don't know, if that sounds
like an enticing topic to you.

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.460
''Institutional'' sounds boring,
but I'm actually

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.590
talking about people, who
control much of the wealth of

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.140
the world, and they have a lot
of influence and importance.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.530
So, I think it's worth
considering them, and

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:32.360
considering it's really
part of the

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:33.550
governance of the world.

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:35.550
How do things happen?

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.810
Who decides what is
going to happen?

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:41.270
What's going to be done?

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.630
Increasingly, it
is professional

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:45.910
institutional investors.

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:47.620
They're kind of unseen,
mostly.

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.050
They don't make movies about
them, not that I've ever seen.

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.640
Someone tell me, if
there is one.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.020
But they're very important.

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.880
So, I thought I would start
by just talking about the

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.010
importance of --

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.970
in this lecture I'm going to
include both people, who

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:12.700
manage money for institutional
portfolios, and also financial

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.290
advisors and financial
planners.

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.060
They're a very big and
important part

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.930
of the world economy.

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.770
But I wanted to start by just
giving some perspective on

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.070
them, by looking at what
it is that we own,

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.140
and what they manage.

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.710
So, I thought I would start
for the United States, and

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.410
show a list of everything,
everything that's owned.

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.730
And I got this from --

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:45.840
this is from Table B-100 of
the Balance Sheet for the

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:46.706
American Economy [addition: as
of the fourth quarter of

00:01:46.706 --> 00:01:53.250
2010], produced by the Federal
Reserve Board in Washington.

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.150
So, it's really a sum of
everything, everything that

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:00.270
people own in the
United States.

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.210
And the point I'm going to
make from this is, that

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:07.260
institutional investors are
quite prominent on this list,

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:08.320
as managers of it.

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.600
But let's just first
look at the total.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:23.590
This is $70,740 billion, or
let's say, $70 trillion is it.

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:29.080
It's everything that anyone owns
in terms of assets that

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.300
the Fed can measure.

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.020
Of course, there's all
these priceless

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.354
things that we all own.

00:02:35.354 --> 00:02:41.380
They are not on this list.

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:42.350
So, what are they?

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.320
Well, number one
is real estate.

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.210
This is owned by households.

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:49.800
Actually, they lump in
nonprofits, unfortunately,

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.020
because nonprofit organizations
are like people,

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.400
because nobody owns them.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:01.220
So, this is the sum of
everything that ultimate

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.240
owners own, so it's
everything.

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.990
But nonprofits are a small
part of the total.

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:11.090
So, real estate is
$18 trillion.

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.650
That's real estate owned
directly by households and

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.820
nonprofits.

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:20.760
It doesn't include commercial
real estate that is owned by

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.300
some of these other things.

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.910
But that's not held by
institutions, that's held

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.625
directly by households.

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:38.000
But the next item on this thing
is pension funds, and

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.120
that's $13 trillion.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.220
Almost as big as real estate.

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.000
And what are pension funds?

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.250
These are plans, that either
businesses create for their

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.040
employees, or that people
invest in themselves for

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.630
retirement.

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.100
It's planning for old age.

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.780
Then, there's equity in
non-corporate business.

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.480
Non-corporate business means
family businesses.

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.450
Well, not necessarily family,
but partnerships and family

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.250
businesses.

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.270
You know, the corner store is a

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:15.190
business, it's worth something.

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:18.340
The Fed has estimated the total
value of all of these

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:24.380
non-corporate businesses, and
estimates them at $6 trillion.

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:26.630
Again, that's not
institutionally held, that's

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:30.180
held by families and people.

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.520
So far, we've got more family
than institutional.

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.070
But then, as you keep going down
the list, deposits are

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:40.140
deposits at banks.
$8 trillion.

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:42.335
That's savings deposits,
time deposits.

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.380
Now, that's institutional
investors managing that.

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:52.020
Corporate equities, now this
is shares in corporations,

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:52.840
owned by households.

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:53.730
That's $8 trillion.

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:56.735
Now, we're back to households
owning them directly.

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:02.680
But then, we have
mutual funds.

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:06.920
Mutual funds are investment
funds for the general public,

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:10.530
that invest in equities
and sometimes

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:13.340
bonds and other things.

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:17.200
And that's almost $5 trillion.

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.030
Consumer durables.

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:20.290
We're going kind of -- seems
like half and half or maybe a

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:22.740
little bit less than half are
institutional, but it's a big

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:24.280
share so far.

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:27.960
Consumer durables, about
$5 trillion.

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:32.450
That's your cars, your clothes
that you're wearing, whatever

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:35.290
else is in your house.

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:37.300
It's estimated at $5 trillion.

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:40.190
Treasury securities are --

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:42.500
now, that's government bonds.

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:44.620
It might surprise you that
it's only $1 trillion.

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:49.850
That includes both savings
bonds, which your

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:51.180
grandmother gave you.

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:53.010
I don't know if you
got that --

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:55.340
you got a $100 saving bonds --

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:57.030
maybe you did.

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:01.620
But that's only $100, doesn't
add up to much.

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:07.800
There are big-time treasury
securities that are treasury

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.980
bonds, treasury notes, but they
generally are held by

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:13.420
institutions, not -- households
just generally

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:15.240
don't buy them.

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.880
The total national debt is now
-- in the United States it's

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:18.823
$14 trillion [addition:
approximately, as of April 11,

00:06:18.823 --> 00:06:22.440
2011], but only $1 trillion,
that's only 1/14 of it, is

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:23.820
held by households.

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:27.700
So, the institutions hold the
rest. Well, foreigners hold

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:30.170
some of the rest, too,
but we're not

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:31.690
counting foreigners here.

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:35.640
Corporate bonds held directly
by households, $2 trillion.

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:40.920
Municipal bonds held by
households, $1 trillion.

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:42.800
But I'll come to this -- the
total municipal bonds

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.080
outstanding are more
like $3 trillion.

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:49.260
So, households don't hold them
generally, except indirectly

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.539
through institutions.

00:06:52.539 --> 00:06:53.679
Life insurance.

00:06:53.679 --> 00:06:57.049
These are reserves at life
insurance institutions.

00:06:57.049 --> 00:06:59.900
That would be institutional
investors again.

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:05.710
So, it seems like less than
half, but close to half of all

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:09.910
of the assets in this
country are held by

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:12.250
institutional investors.

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:15.040
This is a change from
100 years ago.

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:17.490
100 years ago, virtually none
of it would be held by

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:21.980
institutional investors, so our
society is becoming more

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:25.440
institutionalized, more and more
things are being done by

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:26.550
professionals.

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:32.240
And a related thing I wanted to
mention again is that, as

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:37.430
society gets more modern, the
importance of the family is

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:40.620
diminished and the importance
of government

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:44.360
and business is increased.

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:48.090
So for example, pension funds
are taking over what used to

00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:50.070
be a family responsibility.

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:54.030
When Grandma and Grandpa get
old, they move into your house

00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:56.470
and you take care of them.

00:07:56.470 --> 00:08:00.930
That's an extra-financial thing
that has gone on from

00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:02.340
time immemorial.

00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:04.440
But now, it works differently.

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:07.540
Grandpa and Grandma commit
to a pension fund,

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:08.690
contribute to it.

00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:11.960
When they get old, they move
to an assisted living

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:17.440
facility, which is a place where
maybe they're happier.

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:17.740
I don't know.

00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:19.910
At least they can choose.

00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:22.050
They don't have just the single
choice of living with

00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:24.160
you, which they might
not like.

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:27.610
They might like it, they might
not, but it's working more

00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:28.660
institutionally.

00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:30.190
So, this is really --

00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:32.860
I wanted to talk about thoughts,
about where our

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:36.370
society is going, and seeing
the increasing

00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:38.060
professionalization of it.

00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:40.570
I thought to complete this
list I should --

00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:43.590
remember, the previous
slide --

00:08:43.590 --> 00:08:48.230
this $70 trillion is assets
owned by the households.

00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:50.830
But I just wanted to get
you in the right

00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:51.720
perspective on this.

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:53.523
What about liabilities?

00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:59.048
So, the Federal Reserve Board
computes that, too.

00:08:59.048 --> 00:09:01.020
[addition: The data is as of the
fourth quarter of 2010.]

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:03.710
Those assets are owned, but
it's not net worth of

00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:08.470
households, because the
households owe money, too.

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:12.160
So, the biggest debt that
households owe is, in the

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:16.970
United States, $10 trillion
of home mortgages.

00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:21.460
We saw they have $18 trillion
of real estate, but they owe

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:26.080
$10 trillion, so that they
have a net worth in real

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:29.280
estate of only $8 trillion.

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:33.170
But moreover, consumer credit
is $2.4 trillion.

00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:38.090
That's credit card debt and some
other revolving debt like

00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:42.020
department store cards, or
when you buy something --

00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:46.780
when you buy a car on time, it
would go into that total.

00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:51.710
So, the total liabilities
are $13.9 trillion.

00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:54.770
And then, so household net
worth is the $70 trillion

00:09:54.770 --> 00:09:59.630
assets minus the almost $14
trillion liabilities.

00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:05.150
So, it's $56.8 trillion
is the total assets.

00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:12.360
And in per capita terms,
that's $184,000.

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:15.285
That would mean that the average
family of four has

00:10:15.285 --> 00:10:16.520
about $800,000 --

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:19.730
I'm just multiplying
it, 184 by 4.

00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:22.480
That's almost $800,000,
so we're a country of

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:24.210
millionaires, I guess.

00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:26.460
Or soon to be.

00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:30.620
But the problem is it's not
-- it's only on average.

00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:34.220
This is unequally distributed.

00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:38.730
But I should also add, the U.S.
government has a debt of,

00:10:38.730 --> 00:10:39.682
as of this morning
[addition: April 11, 2011]

00:10:39.682 --> 00:10:40.500
--

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:43.080
I looked it up on a national
debt clock --

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:45.210
$14.286 trillion.

00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:48.460
And that's not counted as a
liability of households.

00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:51.770
But it should be, because we
have to pay it, and we're

00:10:51.770 --> 00:10:54.540
going to pay it through
our taxes, eventually.

00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:58.660
So, you might subtract off
another $14 trillion from the

00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:00.220
$56 trillion.

00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:02.630
And then, let's not forget,
there's state and local

00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:05.574
government debt, which is
another $3 trillion [addition:

00:11:05.574 --> 00:11:06.450
approximately, as of
April 11, 2011].

00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:09.960
So, what does that
bring us down to?

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:14.050
Something like $40
trillion or less.

00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:24.020
I wanted to do that just to get
perspective on what our

00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:25.750
assets and liabilities
look like.

00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:31.770
The other thing is --

00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:37.490
I'm trying to put things in
complete perspective, so I

00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:40.520
wanted to talk also about
something that's not on any of

00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:44.390
this, and that's
human capital.

00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:54.140
Human capital is the value of
our people, and what people

00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:57.050
can do and produce.

00:11:57.050 --> 00:12:02.360
And if you want to develop total
national wealth, you

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:05.420
would want to include human
capital as well.

00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:09.130
So, what is the national wealth
for the United States,

00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:10.925
if we include everything?

00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:17.910
Well, the way I figured that
is, right now the national

00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:26.755
income, U.S. national income
is $13 trillion a year

00:12:26.755 --> 00:12:30.310
[addition: as of 2010].

00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:33.730
And I want to capitalize
that, to value their

00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:35.640
present value with that.

00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:44.980
If you assume 3% growth in real
terms and a 5% discount

00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:55.800
rate, that would make wealth
equal to $13 trillion --

00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:57.590
I'm using the Gordon
formula --

00:12:57.590 --> 00:13:07.790
divided by 0.05 minus 0.03,
or $260 trillion.

00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:13.360
That's also just for
perspective, because I just

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:16.110
wanted to put this $40 or $50
trillion in perspective.

00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:17.520
I'm kind of diminishing
my lecture.

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:21.540
I'm telling you institutional
investors are important, but

00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:25.180
as a fraction of the total
national wealth,

00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:26.360
it's not that important.

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:30.210
And I think the family is still
very important, as a

00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:31.840
manager of our wealth.

00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:38.720
This is not managed by
institutional investors.

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:41.520
One more calculation that will
diminish the importance of

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:43.730
institutional investors
even more.

00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:46.650
What do you think the
world is worth?

00:13:46.650 --> 00:13:50.420
If we were to take the total
national income of the whole

00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:55.260
world, and take the present
value of that, well, according

00:13:55.260 --> 00:14:01.270
to the International Monetary
Fund in Washington, which

00:14:01.270 --> 00:14:09.480
estimates for the world, world
national income in 2010, well,

00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:11.320
world income --

00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:14.350
actually, this is world GDP, I
believe, but I'll use that as

00:14:14.350 --> 00:14:16.150
a proxy for income --

00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:23.850
is $62 trillion.

00:14:23.850 --> 00:14:27.710
And if I use the same discount
rate and assumed growth rates,

00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:30.500
you know what I get for the
value of the world?

00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:32.130
World wealth?

00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:35.520
It's $1.2 quadrillion.

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:45.520
Again, to put things in
perspective, we are going

00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:48.090
through an enormous transition
in the world.

00:14:48.090 --> 00:14:51.660
I'm only assuming a 3% growth
rate for the world, and many

00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:55.400
countries are growing at 7% to
9% now, so maybe this is

00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:56.650
conservative.

00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:07.210
But I think that, as the world
matures, as we become more and

00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:13.220
more modern and capitalist, the
importance of the family

00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:13.980
will remain.

00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:16.750
It will remain important, but
it will diminish in relative

00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:17.980
importance.

00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:22.040
So, as time goes on, we're going
to see something like a

00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:26.240
quadrillion dollars increasingly
managed by

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:28.710
institutional investors.

00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:34.034
So that's, what I want
to talk about today.

00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:47.230
As I was saying, in modern
society we do things

00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:49.230
differently.

00:15:49.230 --> 00:15:55.520
We don't expect young people to
take their parents in, to

00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:57.450
care for them.

00:15:57.450 --> 00:15:58.715
I mentioned that
as an example.

00:16:02.770 --> 00:16:06.330
Is that, because we don't care
about our parents as much as

00:16:06.330 --> 00:16:07.580
we used to?

00:16:10.010 --> 00:16:12.060
Interesting question.

00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:16.800
There's a lot of discussion
about that, but my general

00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:21.310
take on it is, that most
elderly people

00:16:21.310 --> 00:16:23.330
like to have choices.

00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:25.110
They love their children,
but they don't want to

00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:26.360
move in with them.

00:16:28.650 --> 00:16:31.990
They want to have a savings,
some kind of pension, they

00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:34.110
want to be able to choose,
how they live, with

00:16:34.110 --> 00:16:37.150
whom they live with.

00:16:37.150 --> 00:16:40.010
Similarly, our health care, we
used to depend on our families

00:16:40.010 --> 00:16:42.510
to provide health care, but
it didn't work very well.

00:16:42.510 --> 00:16:44.660
People weren't getting very
good health care.

00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:50.430
And now, we have it all
institutionalized through

00:16:50.430 --> 00:16:57.980
trust funds for health plans,
and benefits and the like.

00:16:57.980 --> 00:17:00.950
This means that it's
more and more run

00:17:00.950 --> 00:17:04.400
by investment managers.

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:13.200
And investment managers are
trained in modern finance and

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:14.760
understand risk management.

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:17.480
So, there's a professionalism
to all this.

00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:20.280
The family is of limited --

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:23.570
even if they were smart, even
if they were brilliant as

00:17:23.570 --> 00:17:26.690
investment managers, they're
a small unit.

00:17:26.690 --> 00:17:31.210
And unless they were to engage
in some kind of risk sharing

00:17:31.210 --> 00:17:33.620
agreement, they can't
manage risk well.

00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:37.580
The whole family is too small
a unit to manage risk.

00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:42.570
But increasingly, investment
managers are running risk

00:17:42.570 --> 00:17:46.410
management for families,
that allows risk

00:17:46.410 --> 00:17:48.950
sharing around the world.

00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:50.670
We have growing pains
with this.

00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:55.000
The recent financial crisis
shows that investment managers

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.900
mess up sometimes, and their
attempt to share risks around

00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:00.890
the world --

00:18:00.890 --> 00:18:05.600
like, for example, the subprime
crisis was caused by

00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:11.280
the failure to manage mortgage
risk appropriately.

00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:13.000
But nonetheless, I think
they're getting more

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.613
professional and
more important.

00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:23.390
So, right now we have
professional risk managers

00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:27.910
that are, I think, increasingly
important in our

00:18:27.910 --> 00:18:31.150
very lives.

00:18:31.150 --> 00:18:34.135
Now, they have a
fiduciary duty.

00:18:37.230 --> 00:18:41.000
If you are managing other
people's money --

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.860
that's a quote -- ''other
people's money,'' then you

00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:46.300
might be negligent.

00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:48.390
It's not my money,
what do I care?

00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:51.970
So, the law prescribes that you,
as an investment manager,

00:18:51.970 --> 00:18:58.190
have a duty to act in the
interest of the person you're

00:18:58.190 --> 00:19:06.860
managing for, or the group of
people you're managing for.

00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:11.720
And the law has been trying to
prescribe what this duty is.

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:21.850
There's something called the
''prudent person rule,'' which

00:19:21.850 --> 00:19:27.020
is a rule that investment
managers have to behave as a

00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:30.320
prudent person would.

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:33.070
I'll read one definition
of it.

00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:42.820
ERISA, which was an act of
Congress in 1974, defined --

00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:45.710
they called it ''prudent man
rule'' back then, because our

00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:53.210
language was still
sexist in 1974 --

00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:56.370
they said that ''investment
managers running pension funds

00:19:56.370 --> 00:20:01.010
must manage with the care,
skill, prudence, and diligence

00:20:01.010 --> 00:20:05.950
under the circumstances then
prevailing, that a prudent man

00:20:05.950 --> 00:20:11.180
acting in a like capacity and
familiar with such matters

00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:15.510
would use in the conduct of an
enterprise of a like character

00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:18.190
and with like aims."

00:20:18.190 --> 00:20:21.150
They're trying to legislate
what it is

00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:23.830
to be a good fiduciary.

00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:25.010
And it seems sensible.

00:20:25.010 --> 00:20:28.400
You should ask -- if someone is
managing a pension fund for

00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:32.300
elderly people, they shouldn't
do wild and crazy investments.

00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:34.410
They shouldn't invest
in racehorses or

00:20:34.410 --> 00:20:35.600
something like that.

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:37.260
It should be prudent.

00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:38.490
But then, how do
you define it?

00:20:38.490 --> 00:20:46.990
If you read the act, it says,
they would be acting like a

00:20:46.990 --> 00:20:51.780
prudent man ''in a like capacity
in a conduct in an

00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:55.970
enterprise of a like character
and was like aims."

00:20:55.970 --> 00:20:59.790
The problem is, with the 1974
act, that it's hard to

00:20:59.790 --> 00:21:04.440
legislate duty, define
what it is.

00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:08.150
So, what the law said, and it
has said it in many places, is

00:21:08.150 --> 00:21:10.680
that you have to -- as
a fiduciary, as an

00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:12.200
investment manager --

00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:16.730
you have to act as a prudent
person would act.

00:21:16.730 --> 00:21:18.980
And what is a prudent person?

00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:21.780
I guess, it's somebody else.

00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:25.190
Somebody else, who
is of a kind of a

00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:27.880
standard or ordinary type.

00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:28.670
I don't know what it is.

00:21:28.670 --> 00:21:31.350
I mean, I could say that
investing in racehorses is the

00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:36.180
smartest thing for me to do, but
I can't claim that that's

00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:38.030
a prudent person act.

00:21:38.030 --> 00:21:41.570
So, the law has required
institutional investors to

00:21:41.570 --> 00:21:46.970
some extent to behave, not as
they would behave, but as they

00:21:46.970 --> 00:21:51.410
think other people would behave.
It was legislating a

00:21:51.410 --> 00:21:54.830
requirement, that you don't do
what you think is smart, you

00:21:54.830 --> 00:21:57.970
do what you think other
people think is smart.

00:21:57.970 --> 00:22:03.160
And this has been a problem,
because what it has done is,

00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:07.920
it has created a class of
institutional investors, who

00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:12.820
live in fear of laws that could
come down on them, if

00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:17.200
they, with the best of
intentions, invest on behalf

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:23.090
of their clients in an
unconventional way, and

00:22:23.090 --> 00:22:26.120
therefore could be punished
for violating the prudent

00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:27.370
person rule.

00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:35.710
Thus, for example, because of
the prudent person rule,

00:22:35.710 --> 00:22:38.750
university endowments, which
are an example of

00:22:38.750 --> 00:22:43.300
institutional investments, for
much of the 20th century were

00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:48.560
invested in bonds, government
bonds, because they thought,

00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:49.400
well, that's prudent.

00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:53.120
No one can tell me that
we're not prudent.

00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:56.510
The government bond is safe.

00:22:56.510 --> 00:23:04.470
But some investment portfolios,
notably

00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:07.840
the one that --

00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:11.360
we had David Swensen come and
speak to us earlier --

00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:14.230
took a more aggressive
interpretation of the prudent

00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:21.850
person rule, and developed an
investment strategy that

00:23:21.850 --> 00:23:23.310
looked imprudent.

00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:27.560
So for example, Yale University
was investing in

00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:31.920
startup dot-com firms during
the dot-com explosion --

00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:34.350
managed to sell out
just at the peak.

00:23:34.350 --> 00:23:37.030
Is that being a prudent
person?

00:23:37.030 --> 00:23:40.660
Well, the interpretation of the
prudent person rule has

00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:43.770
changed, and this is part
of the phenomenon

00:23:43.770 --> 00:23:44.790
that drove the bubble.

00:23:44.790 --> 00:23:48.240
Institutional investors,
led by people like

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:50.300
David Swensen --

00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:54.670
it lead to a more benign
interpretation of the prudent

00:23:54.670 --> 00:23:58.220
person rule, and allowed
them to take chances.

00:23:58.220 --> 00:24:03.070
And I think that, that general
sense that one could be more

00:24:03.070 --> 00:24:07.380
aggressive in investing, was
part of the bubble that led to

00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:08.690
the financial crisis.

00:24:08.690 --> 00:24:10.810
I'm not saying it's a bad
thing in itself, but I'm

00:24:10.810 --> 00:24:12.550
telling you it was part
of the factors

00:24:12.550 --> 00:24:19.550
that led to this bubble.

00:24:19.550 --> 00:24:21.322
I looked through Dodd-Frank.

00:24:21.322 --> 00:24:29.230
The Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 is
the most important piece of

00:24:29.230 --> 00:24:33.720
financial legislation in the
United States since the Great

00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:34.890
Depression.

00:24:34.890 --> 00:24:38.430
And I did a search for
prudent person --

00:24:38.430 --> 00:24:42.720
it appears nowhere.

00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:51.920
But I found that the word
prudential standards appeared

00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:57.210
34 times in the Dodd-Frank
Act.

00:24:57.210 --> 00:25:01.720
So, it seems like the financial
crisis is changing

00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:03.780
things a little bit.

00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:10.530
It's bringing our society to
want regulators, government

00:25:10.530 --> 00:25:15.640
regulators, to be making the
ultimate decisions about what

00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:20.495
kind of risks institutional
investors will take on.

00:25:20.495 --> 00:25:22.980
They're still letting households
do what they want,

00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:26.950
but in terms of institutional
investors, the Dodd-Frank Act

00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:31.020
talks extensively about
regulators going in and

00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:33.580
regulating what institutional
investors --

00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:35.810
what kinds of risk
they can take.

00:25:35.810 --> 00:25:38.600
The same thing is true
in other countries.

00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:42.210
I think, this is a
world phenomenon.

00:25:42.210 --> 00:25:45.510
The problem is that the prudent
person rule didn't

00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:48.740
seem to work, didn't seem
to work well enough.

00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:52.830
It started out, when it was
first imposed, as encouraging

00:25:52.830 --> 00:25:55.570
a very conservative investment,
but then people

00:25:55.570 --> 00:25:58.740
thought, as time went on, that
that didn't make sense, they

00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:07.360
got more loose, and it let
to a financial crisis.

00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:13.280
So, Dodd-Frank is creating
something called the FSOC, the

00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:17.040
Financial Stability Oversight
Commission, which

00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:20.160
has to enforce --

00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:23.260
well, it doesn't enforce, but
it makes recommendations on

00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:26.210
prudential standards,
particularly regarding --

00:26:26.210 --> 00:26:27.370
well, I wouldn't say
particularly --

00:26:27.370 --> 00:26:28.660
but including leverage.

00:26:31.230 --> 00:26:32.120
Leverage --

00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:33.370
we talked about it --

00:26:35.730 --> 00:26:38.180
it's a measure of the risk that
you've imposed on your

00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:41.930
portfolio by borrowing
to buy assets.

00:26:41.930 --> 00:26:45.920
The economy became increasingly
leveraged up

00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:50.980
until the financial crisis,
when it began around 2007.

00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:53.360
And people were concerned
about that.

00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:56.300
Well, were institutions
following the

00:26:56.300 --> 00:26:58.850
prudent person rule?

00:26:58.850 --> 00:27:02.520
Well, somehow, as time went on,
their mind allowed more

00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:07.570
and more leverage to be
considered acceptable.

00:27:07.570 --> 00:27:13.310
So, now what we have in the
Dodd-Frank Act is, that the

00:27:13.310 --> 00:27:17.070
Financial Services Oversight
Commission is supposed to

00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:21.650
recommend standards of leverage
and prudential

00:27:21.650 --> 00:27:26.290
standards for financial
corporations, and to put

00:27:26.290 --> 00:27:30.600
financial corporations under
increasing regulatory

00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:33.770
authority to meet
those standards.

00:27:33.770 --> 00:27:36.400
So, in some sense, it's shifted
to the government.

00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:41.460
We had seen a historic shift of
power over investments from

00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:44.630
individual investors to
institutional investors, and

00:27:44.630 --> 00:27:47.635
to some extent, at least, it's
shifting to the government.

00:27:51.130 --> 00:27:51.870
And I think --

00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:55.590
I'm talking mostly about the
U.S., but I think this is a

00:27:55.590 --> 00:28:00.130
currently worldwide trend.

00:28:00.130 --> 00:28:01.210
It's exemplified also --

00:28:01.210 --> 00:28:05.540
I mentioned before, that we had
private organizations, the

00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:11.010
securities rating agencies such
as Moody's and Standard &amp;

00:28:11.010 --> 00:28:15.540
Poor's and Fitch, but the
governments are trusting them

00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:18.560
less, and they're putting
standards more on government

00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:19.810
regulators now.

00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:26.430
I said I would talk about
financial advisors.

00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:35.970
Financial advisors are people,
who don't directly manage

00:28:35.970 --> 00:28:39.250
portfolios, they're not
institutional investors, but

00:28:39.250 --> 00:28:41.430
they give advice to
those who do.

00:28:43.950 --> 00:28:51.800
And the financial advisors are
regulated by governments in

00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:54.200
most countries.

00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:59.750
So in the U.S., for example,
the SEC, the Securities and

00:28:59.750 --> 00:29:10.900
Exchange Commission, requires
advisors to be approved by

00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:21.230
FINRA, to win FINRA approval,
where FINRA is the successor

00:29:21.230 --> 00:29:24.240
to the National Association
of Securities Dealers.

00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:31.100
It's a non-government
organization that administers

00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:33.975
an examination and education
program for advisors.

00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:41.330
And so, you effectively have
to go through FINRA to get

00:29:41.330 --> 00:29:43.076
licensed to be a financial
advisor.

00:29:54.170 --> 00:29:56.370
I'll give you an example
of an organization

00:29:56.370 --> 00:29:58.940
of financial advisors.

00:29:58.940 --> 00:30:04.770
NAPFA is the National
Association of Personal

00:30:04.770 --> 00:30:15.940
Financial Advisors, that manages
the relation between

00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:17.790
financial advisors
and the public.

00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:28.010
These people will typically
charge between $75 and $300 an

00:30:28.010 --> 00:30:30.690
hour, and you can get
one tomorrow.

00:30:30.690 --> 00:30:34.760
Just make a phone call, get on
to a website, NAPFA website,

00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:37.090
and hire one.

00:30:37.090 --> 00:30:39.690
And they have a code
of standards.

00:30:39.690 --> 00:30:42.320
They have to be licensed through
the SEC, and they have

00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:46.320
to have an oath of
loyalty to the

00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:49.630
client that they undertake.

00:30:49.630 --> 00:30:50.840
This is a big business.

00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:55.110
I mention it, because in one
of my first lectures I gave

00:30:55.110 --> 00:30:57.810
you a count of how many
people there are.

00:30:57.810 --> 00:30:59.290
But I'm just trying to --

00:30:59.290 --> 00:31:01.545
There's also something else
called a financial planner.

00:31:05.630 --> 00:31:06.880
Financial planners.

00:31:09.490 --> 00:31:13.100
Now that sounds like the same
thing to me, but somehow, if

00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:15.840
you call yourself a financial
planner, you don't have to go

00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:18.770
through this licensing.

00:31:18.770 --> 00:31:26.860
And in the Dodd-Frank Act,
I didn't find much new

00:31:26.860 --> 00:31:28.120
legislation regarding them.

00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:30.295
The Dodd-Frank Act is
calling for a study

00:31:30.295 --> 00:31:31.910
of financial planners.

00:31:34.580 --> 00:31:37.010
The question is, how does the
government get involved in

00:31:37.010 --> 00:31:40.660
making these people
give good advice?

00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:44.280
The problem is, that the
financial crisis seems to be

00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:47.560
led by a lot of bad
advice given out.

00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:50.500
A lot of people were encouraged
to leverage up

00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:53.570
their ownership in their home,
to borrow heavily to buy

00:31:53.570 --> 00:31:54.820
second homes.

00:31:57.930 --> 00:32:01.290
I'm sure, that financial
advisors were not uniformly

00:32:01.290 --> 00:32:04.090
advising that, or financial
planners, but there's a

00:32:04.090 --> 00:32:08.980
concern now about what kind of
advice people were given.

00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:13.330
So in 1996, Congress passed a
bill in the United States,

00:32:13.330 --> 00:32:17.450
saying that financial advisors
cannot be convicted felons,

00:32:17.450 --> 00:32:18.700
among other things.

00:32:21.070 --> 00:32:27.659
But there hadn't been, until
then, such a law.

00:32:27.659 --> 00:32:30.659
We have something else called
mortgage brokers.

00:32:30.659 --> 00:32:31.909
It's a little different.

00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:37.100
These are people, who
give advice on

00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:39.139
getting a home mortgage.

00:32:39.139 --> 00:32:43.420
There was no licensing of them
until the financial crisis.

00:32:43.420 --> 00:32:45.070
Because mortgage brokers
could be anything.

00:32:45.070 --> 00:32:48.239
They could even be a convicted
felon, until just a few years

00:32:48.239 --> 00:32:51.354
ago, until after the crisis.

00:32:51.354 --> 00:32:52.780
Here's the fundamental
problem, that

00:32:52.780 --> 00:32:54.290
people are getting --

00:32:54.290 --> 00:32:57.780
they're confronted by an
increasingly complicated

00:32:57.780 --> 00:33:00.190
financial structure.

00:33:00.190 --> 00:33:04.760
Living is less family, and
it's more investing and

00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:07.080
getting involved in financial
markets, and most people don't

00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:08.449
know how to do it.

00:33:08.449 --> 00:33:14.760
And that the people, who give
them advice often, are not

00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:16.420
giving them the best advice.

00:33:16.420 --> 00:33:18.030
What can we do about that?

00:33:18.030 --> 00:33:20.910
Well, the government is trying,
but it's imperfect.

00:33:27.190 --> 00:33:29.690
I think that, as the world
develops, I think we'll

00:33:29.690 --> 00:33:31.230
probably see --

00:33:31.230 --> 00:33:34.000
I think there is a trend
toward increasing the

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:39.020
professionalization
of these groups.

00:33:39.020 --> 00:33:42.410
And although it's not a simple
matter to straighten out some

00:33:42.410 --> 00:33:46.580
of the irregularities, we're
moving, as the world gets

00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:49.650
better and better, to even
stronger such institutions.

00:33:52.565 --> 00:33:54.990
Now, I wanted to go through
some kinds of

00:33:54.990 --> 00:33:56.240
institutional investing.

00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:05.870
The mutual fund is --

00:34:09.410 --> 00:34:11.880
I've talked about
this before --

00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:18.900
is an investment company that
is owned mutually by the

00:34:18.900 --> 00:34:20.240
participants.

00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:24.050
It will invest typically in
stocks, and it distributes

00:34:24.050 --> 00:34:26.600
everything to the owners of the
stock [correction: owners

00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:28.295
of the fund].

00:34:28.295 --> 00:34:34.940
The first mutual fund was the
Massachusetts Investor Trust.

00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:36.990
That's not the university.

00:34:36.990 --> 00:34:37.130
Massachusetts --

00:34:37.130 --> 00:34:39.020
I'm sorry --

00:34:39.020 --> 00:34:44.480
Investment Trust, which was
founded in the 1920s.

00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:47.490
And it was very open and direct
with its investors.

00:34:47.490 --> 00:34:50.920
It published its portfolio.

00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:52.050
It promised --

00:34:52.050 --> 00:34:54.680
it was completely open
about what it did --

00:34:54.680 --> 00:34:57.650
and it promised nothing more
than it would divide up all of

00:34:57.650 --> 00:35:01.050
the returns among the
participants.

00:35:01.050 --> 00:35:05.420
There were no senior members,
who got more of the money than

00:35:05.420 --> 00:35:08.040
anyone else.

00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:11.660
So, MIT became a model
for an investment

00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:13.030
fund for the public.

00:35:13.030 --> 00:35:20.480
In the 1920s, there were many
investment funds that were

00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:21.960
exploitative of the public.

00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:25.450
They had two classes of
investors, and the first class

00:35:25.450 --> 00:35:28.510
of investors ran off with the
money, at the expense of

00:35:28.510 --> 00:35:29.690
everyone else.

00:35:29.690 --> 00:35:35.090
So, it took a while after the
1929 crash, but the Investment

00:35:35.090 --> 00:35:42.050
Company Act of 1940 set
the stage for the

00:35:42.050 --> 00:35:44.850
growth of mutual funds.

00:35:44.850 --> 00:35:51.650
And so, mutual funds are
designed for individuals, and

00:35:51.650 --> 00:35:52.900
they are --

00:35:55.120 --> 00:35:56.360
this is U.S. --

00:35:56.360 --> 00:35:59.440
they are a very successful
institution.

00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:00.820
So, you know exactly what --

00:36:00.820 --> 00:36:02.930
they have regular reports -- you
know exactly what they're

00:36:02.930 --> 00:36:08.420
doing, and there's no rich
person benefiting excessively

00:36:08.420 --> 00:36:10.340
from what happens.

00:36:10.340 --> 00:36:17.910
In Europe, they have an
analogous institution, UCITS.

00:36:17.910 --> 00:36:24.190
It refers to a European Union
directive, called the

00:36:24.190 --> 00:36:27.980
Undertaking for Collective
Investment and Transferable

00:36:27.980 --> 00:36:35.157
Securities, which is an
EU directive, 1985

00:36:35.157 --> 00:36:35.293
[clarification: In 1985, it
was still the European

00:36:35.293 --> 00:36:35.463
Communities, and not yet the EU,
which was not established

00:36:35.463 --> 00:36:42.480
until 1993.], and then they had
revisions in 2001, that

00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:45.840
creates a standard investment
fund like a

00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:47.615
mutual fund for Europe.

00:36:47.615 --> 00:36:50.970
It used to be that every
European country had its own

00:36:50.970 --> 00:36:54.990
securities law, and it made it
difficult, because there's so

00:36:54.990 --> 00:36:56.600
many European countries.

00:36:56.600 --> 00:36:59.970
So, they standardized, and
they developed a sort of

00:36:59.970 --> 00:37:02.170
European version of
the mutual fund.

00:37:02.170 --> 00:37:05.210
The key difference, I think,
between a mutual fund in the

00:37:05.210 --> 00:37:09.090
U.S. and a UCITS
in Europe is --

00:37:09.090 --> 00:37:09.860
it's technical --

00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:11.450
it's how they're taxed.

00:37:11.450 --> 00:37:14.130
The mutual fund in the
United States --

00:37:14.130 --> 00:37:17.830
if you own shares in a mutual
fund and you just hold them,

00:37:17.830 --> 00:37:21.960
you will still get capital gains
taxes every year, even

00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:23.560
if you didn't sell it.

00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:26.370
Because other people in the
mutual fund sell some of their

00:37:26.370 --> 00:37:30.160
shares, generating a capital
gains, and that capital gains

00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:32.680
is then distributed to all
of the participants

00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:34.180
in the mutual fund.

00:37:34.180 --> 00:37:38.290
With a UCITS in Europe, you
don't pay capital gains taxes,

00:37:38.290 --> 00:37:41.190
unless you yourself sell.

00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:44.680
So, I think the UCITS
form is gaining on

00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:46.950
the mutual fund form.

00:37:46.950 --> 00:37:50.700
And some people, notably
Robert Pozen at Harvard

00:37:50.700 --> 00:37:54.630
Business School is advocating
that the U.S. switch to the

00:37:54.630 --> 00:37:55.880
European standard.

00:37:58.120 --> 00:37:59.680
I wanted to talk about trusts.

00:38:07.020 --> 00:38:09.490
What is a trust?

00:38:09.490 --> 00:38:18.000
It is money held on behalf
of another individual.

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:25.390
Well, particularly a personal
trust is something, that you

00:38:25.390 --> 00:38:32.050
can set up on behalf of another
person or a cause, so

00:38:32.050 --> 00:38:37.820
that an institutional investor
will manage money on behalf of

00:38:37.820 --> 00:38:39.750
that person or cause.

00:38:39.750 --> 00:38:46.090
And a company that does trusts
is called a trust company, and

00:38:46.090 --> 00:38:50.230
trust companies have often been
combined with banks, but

00:38:50.230 --> 00:38:52.740
they're not necessarily
part of a bank.

00:38:52.740 --> 00:38:56.097
You see many institutions and
the title will be Bank and

00:38:56.097 --> 00:38:57.860
Trust Company.

00:38:57.860 --> 00:38:58.960
Well, you know what
a bank does.

00:38:58.960 --> 00:39:01.120
It takes deposits
and makes loans.

00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:03.850
What does a trust company do?

00:39:03.850 --> 00:39:10.130
It creates trusts on behalf of
some person and manages the

00:39:10.130 --> 00:39:10.910
money for them.

00:39:10.910 --> 00:39:14.610
A classic example of a trust
is, imagine that you have a

00:39:14.610 --> 00:39:21.670
child, who is handicapped in
some way and unable to manage

00:39:21.670 --> 00:39:25.400
his or her own affairs.

00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:29.240
And you, as a parent, know that
your child will outlive

00:39:29.240 --> 00:39:33.050
you, and so how do you
provide for the child

00:39:33.050 --> 00:39:35.280
after you are gone?

00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:38.720
Well, you create a trust
for the child.

00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:42.960
And you can go to a trust
company and say, I want an

00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:46.660
income for my child, managed
for the rest of my child's

00:39:46.660 --> 00:39:49.940
life, and the bank will outlive
you -- or the trust

00:39:49.940 --> 00:39:52.480
company will outlive you
-- and can do that.

00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:56.910
So, this is very important,
because it allows people to

00:39:56.910 --> 00:40:01.520
create situations that
outlive them.

00:40:04.020 --> 00:40:09.700
But particularly in common law
countries, it doesn't have to

00:40:09.700 --> 00:40:10.520
be a company.

00:40:10.520 --> 00:40:14.140
You can set up a trust, you can
take a young relative of

00:40:14.140 --> 00:40:17.350
yours, who will outlive you, and
say, I want you to be the

00:40:17.350 --> 00:40:20.760
trust manager for my child.

00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:25.370
And if you become ill, can
you appoint a successor?

00:40:25.370 --> 00:40:27.290
You can do that, too.

00:40:27.290 --> 00:40:31.470
U.S. trust law recognizes the
importance of trusts, and so

00:40:31.470 --> 00:40:34.430
that person -- suppose that
person that you appoint as a

00:40:34.430 --> 00:40:37.850
trustee for your child, suppose
that person goes

00:40:37.850 --> 00:40:41.110
bankrupt, and then other people
are taking, seizing,

00:40:41.110 --> 00:40:42.670
that person's assets.

00:40:42.670 --> 00:40:47.150
They could not take the assets
in the trust, because the law

00:40:47.150 --> 00:40:49.080
recognizes the importance
of trusts.

00:40:55.990 --> 00:40:57.370
There are different
kinds of trusts.

00:40:57.370 --> 00:40:59.510
But I thought, I should tell
you about a particular kind

00:40:59.510 --> 00:41:04.720
that may be relevant to some
of you in your future.

00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:07.620
There's a certain kind of trust
called a ''spendthrift

00:41:07.620 --> 00:41:15.940
trust,'' which is a trust that
your parents may be setting up

00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:17.040
for you now.

00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:18.890
I don't know.

00:41:18.890 --> 00:41:20.750
What is a spendthrift?

00:41:20.750 --> 00:41:24.200
A spendthrift is someone who
spends money to freely.

00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:26.440
Can't be trusted to
manage money.

00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:29.740
Suppose, you have a child, who's
like that, and you're

00:41:29.740 --> 00:41:32.530
getting on in years, and you're
thinking that you could

00:41:32.530 --> 00:41:33.830
leave a will to your child.

00:41:37.270 --> 00:41:41.140
But the child might
just blow it.

00:41:41.140 --> 00:41:43.940
So, what you do is, you go to a
trust company, and you say,

00:41:43.940 --> 00:41:46.430
I'd like to set up a spendthrift
trust for my

00:41:46.430 --> 00:41:51.110
child, and after I die, the
trust will pay my child an

00:41:51.110 --> 00:41:54.810
income, and the child
cannot get at the

00:41:54.810 --> 00:41:58.300
assets, only the income.

00:41:58.300 --> 00:42:01.275
And so, you manage it, and the
child comes to you and says, I

00:42:01.275 --> 00:42:04.910
want the money, and
you say, sorry.

00:42:04.910 --> 00:42:07.450
Your parents set up a
spendthrift trust. That's all

00:42:07.450 --> 00:42:09.120
you can get.

00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:11.220
There's various reasons
why they do this.

00:42:11.220 --> 00:42:15.980
One of them is, that in a
divorce, if your child gets

00:42:15.980 --> 00:42:21.460
divorced, if you gave money to
the children, the divorce

00:42:21.460 --> 00:42:26.710
court might give half of the
money to the awful spouse your

00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:28.100
child married.

00:42:28.100 --> 00:42:30.170
But if it's a spendthrift trust,
they can't get at it.

00:42:30.170 --> 00:42:32.350
It's income to the child.

00:42:32.350 --> 00:42:33.860
So, there's all kinds
of reasons why

00:42:33.860 --> 00:42:35.690
people set up trusts.

00:42:35.690 --> 00:42:38.020
But I think trusts are a really
an important invention

00:42:38.020 --> 00:42:41.020
in our society, and they're not
talked about very much.

00:42:41.020 --> 00:42:43.590
But I mean, it solves
a real problem.

00:42:43.590 --> 00:42:46.200
This handicapped child problem
is an extreme case,

00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:47.630
but it's very real.

00:42:47.630 --> 00:42:51.330
You can have assurance, the law
makes it clear that that

00:42:51.330 --> 00:42:55.000
money is managed by a
professional for the child.

00:42:58.200 --> 00:43:04.410
These are real and important
institutions that help people

00:43:04.410 --> 00:43:09.890
get on with their lives, and I
think our financial system

00:43:09.890 --> 00:43:13.670
does a lot to make these
things work well.

00:43:13.670 --> 00:43:16.850
I wanted to talk about
pensions because --

00:43:16.850 --> 00:43:19.980
I've already talked about them,
but people do get old

00:43:19.980 --> 00:43:22.640
and they can't keep working.

00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:27.530
And if you look at the history
of the world, the fate of

00:43:27.530 --> 00:43:31.180
elderly people is
highly variable.

00:43:31.180 --> 00:43:34.140
Many of them, if they have good
and dutiful children,

00:43:34.140 --> 00:43:35.580
will do all right --

00:43:35.580 --> 00:43:36.830
who take care of them.

00:43:36.830 --> 00:43:39.530
But in the past, you would find
a lot of elderly people

00:43:39.530 --> 00:43:43.200
out on the streets begging,
because they didn't have

00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:46.470
children, or the children died,
or the children lost

00:43:46.470 --> 00:43:47.720
their income.

00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:52.885
It's a problem that we've worked
substantially to solve,

00:43:52.885 --> 00:43:58.970
and again, it's an example of
progress of our civilization.

00:43:58.970 --> 00:44:01.370
We take it for granted, that
people are living as

00:44:01.370 --> 00:44:06.790
comfortably as well as they are,
but it's substantially a

00:44:06.790 --> 00:44:09.600
product of invention.

00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:12.290
So, the idea of a pension
is actually a

00:44:12.290 --> 00:44:16.310
relatively new idea.

00:44:16.310 --> 00:44:29.130
The first U.S. pension
plan was 1875.

00:44:29.130 --> 00:44:33.830
American Express Company
set up a pension

00:44:33.830 --> 00:44:36.500
plan for its employees.

00:44:36.500 --> 00:44:40.450
There's actually an earlier
example in the U.K., I think,

00:44:40.450 --> 00:44:42.380
but I don't have the
name of it here.

00:44:42.380 --> 00:44:45.990
But only something like
20 years earlier.

00:44:45.990 --> 00:44:48.800
So, until then, there was
never a pension plan.

00:44:51.330 --> 00:44:54.990
So, American Express set up a
plan, and it said employees,

00:44:54.990 --> 00:44:56.220
who had worked at --

00:44:56.220 --> 00:44:59.520
this, by the way, is not the
credit card company, this was

00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:01.080
a delivery company.

00:45:01.080 --> 00:45:02.270
They had stagecoaches.

00:45:02.270 --> 00:45:04.640
This is a long time ago.

00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:10.110
And if you worked there for 20
years, past age 60, and were

00:45:10.110 --> 00:45:14.660
disabled, you would get 50% of
the average of the last 10

00:45:14.660 --> 00:45:16.590
years pay for life.

00:45:16.590 --> 00:45:18.240
This was the model --

00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:26.920
50% of average of the last 10
years pay on retirement.

00:45:26.920 --> 00:45:29.050
Because it was tied to
how much income.

00:45:29.050 --> 00:45:30.980
They thought, you could live
on half the income that you

00:45:30.980 --> 00:45:32.565
earned when you were working.

00:45:35.990 --> 00:45:42.530
In 1901, Carnegie Steel --

00:45:42.530 --> 00:45:46.620
that's Andrew Carnegie, the
same Andrew Carnegie, who

00:45:46.620 --> 00:45:48.370
wrote The Gospel of Wealth
that we've been

00:45:48.370 --> 00:45:50.340
talking about --

00:45:50.340 --> 00:45:58.340
gave what was the first large
industrial pension fund.

00:45:58.340 --> 00:46:04.100
And it covered a substantial
number of people, it was a

00:46:04.100 --> 00:46:09.600
milestone that suggested many
more such pension funds.

00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:13.430
Unions, in the early 20th
century, started setting up

00:46:13.430 --> 00:46:15.290
pension funds.

00:46:15.290 --> 00:46:18.840
For example, the Pattern Makers
in 1900, the Granite

00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:23.340
Cutters and Cigar Makers
in 1905, et cetera.

00:46:23.340 --> 00:46:26.990
The union pension funds became
popular in the early 20th

00:46:26.990 --> 00:46:31.300
century, but there
was a collapse of

00:46:31.300 --> 00:46:36.540
pensions after 1929.

00:46:36.540 --> 00:46:44.530
Many people were promised
pensions in the first three

00:46:44.530 --> 00:46:47.160
decades of the 20th century,
and then the companies just

00:46:47.160 --> 00:46:50.720
went out of business
and didn't --

00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:54.950
moreover, the unions' pension
funds failed especially

00:46:54.950 --> 00:46:56.200
disastrously.

00:46:58.760 --> 00:47:02.120
They didn't manage their money
well, or the institutional

00:47:02.120 --> 00:47:09.400
investors were not
very astute.

00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:11.820
You know, it's like the world
was very amateurish about how

00:47:11.820 --> 00:47:12.720
they handled these things.

00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:15.560
Obviously, it's very important
that people have money to

00:47:15.560 --> 00:47:22.640
retire on, but many of them got
wiped out in 1929, so it

00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:27.170
lead to further thinking
about pensions.

00:47:27.170 --> 00:47:34.850
The General Motors pension plan
was a landmark pension

00:47:34.850 --> 00:47:37.300
plan in 1950.

00:47:37.300 --> 00:47:44.430
And in 1950, GM chairman Charles
Wilson proposed a

00:47:44.430 --> 00:47:46.690
fully funded pension plan.

00:47:46.690 --> 00:47:47.940
This was a new idea.

00:47:51.210 --> 00:47:55.070
That is, General Motors, in
promising to pay you in your

00:47:55.070 --> 00:48:01.060
retirement, would set aside and
invest now enough money,

00:48:01.060 --> 00:48:03.215
so that they would have that.

00:48:03.215 --> 00:48:06.760
In other words, they created
a trust for the employees.

00:48:06.760 --> 00:48:10.530
So, it's just like the parent
for the handicapped child.

00:48:10.530 --> 00:48:13.720
If General Motors dies, doesn't
matter, because

00:48:13.720 --> 00:48:16.760
there's a trust managing
their pension fund.

00:48:16.760 --> 00:48:18.200
You know, it's kind
of a funny idea.

00:48:18.200 --> 00:48:21.570
Why didn't anyone
do that before?

00:48:21.570 --> 00:48:24.850
Why didn't the unions, who were
looking out for the union

00:48:24.850 --> 00:48:30.930
employees, demand that they
fund their pension funds?

00:48:30.930 --> 00:48:34.370
You know, it seems like
financial history shows a lot

00:48:34.370 --> 00:48:35.890
of stupidity.

00:48:35.890 --> 00:48:38.230
I don't quite understand,
how it could be.

00:48:38.230 --> 00:48:40.820
It seems obvious, doesn't it,
that if a company is going to

00:48:40.820 --> 00:48:42.980
promise you for a pension,
that they

00:48:42.980 --> 00:48:44.050
should set aside money?

00:48:44.050 --> 00:48:47.560
Because companies fail
all the time.

00:48:47.560 --> 00:48:51.660
There may have been some union
complicity, that the unions

00:48:51.660 --> 00:48:58.780
were not really always working
on behalf of their members.

00:48:58.780 --> 00:49:01.550
They thought, well, the members
don't think about this

00:49:01.550 --> 00:49:03.750
problem, so we're not going
to think about it, either.

00:49:03.750 --> 00:49:06.160
It's going to come years
down the road, we're

00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:08.790
not going to worry.

00:49:08.790 --> 00:49:13.100
So, General Motors, in
1950, set an example

00:49:13.100 --> 00:49:17.050
for funding the pensions.

00:49:17.050 --> 00:49:20.560
It's very important.

00:49:20.560 --> 00:49:25.120
And more and more firms started
to do that after 1950.

00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:32.778
But the next thing I want
to give is Studebaker.

00:49:32.778 --> 00:49:35.320
Do you remember Studebaker?

00:49:35.320 --> 00:49:39.600
They were one of the major
automobile manufacturers.

00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:41.800
You maybe don't remember
them, because they

00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:45.420
went bankrupt in 1963.

00:49:45.420 --> 00:49:49.365
That's a long time ago for you,
but they were around.

00:49:51.930 --> 00:49:56.960
Well, they had a pension plan
that was partly funded, but

00:49:56.960 --> 00:50:00.430
inadequately funded, and, when
they went out of business,

00:50:00.430 --> 00:50:09.710
their employees lost. So, this
led to arguments about --

00:50:09.710 --> 00:50:12.590
and their labor union, again,
the United Autoworkers,

00:50:12.590 --> 00:50:16.770
supposedly standing up for the
employees, didn't do the job.

00:50:16.770 --> 00:50:19.680
So, the whole idea of labor
management negotiating,

00:50:19.680 --> 00:50:23.310
protecting the workers seemed
flawed, and so the government

00:50:23.310 --> 00:50:27.820
got involved, and
it led to ERISA,

00:50:27.820 --> 00:50:29.950
which I mentioned before.

00:50:29.950 --> 00:50:33.310
1974.

00:50:33.310 --> 00:50:36.040
ERISA stands for Employment
Retirement

00:50:36.040 --> 00:50:38.720
Income Security Act.

00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:43.180
This was an act to clean up
pension funds, and make them

00:50:43.180 --> 00:50:45.050
work well, make them
work better.

00:50:49.170 --> 00:50:52.460
The government wanted to make
sure, not only that pension

00:50:52.460 --> 00:50:55.510
plans said they were funded,
but that they were really

00:50:55.510 --> 00:51:00.840
funded, so that another
bankruptcy wouldn't cause

00:51:00.840 --> 00:51:02.620
pension plans to fail.

00:51:02.620 --> 00:51:07.600
So, ERISA set up a new
government agency, called the

00:51:07.600 --> 00:51:11.710
Pension Benefits Guarantee
Corporation.

00:51:11.710 --> 00:51:14.110
That's PBGC.

00:51:14.110 --> 00:51:19.920
The Pension Benefits Guarantee
Corporation is a government

00:51:19.920 --> 00:51:27.050
organization that insures the
funding of pension plans.

00:51:27.050 --> 00:51:33.930
So, pension plans not only have
to undergo scrutiny by

00:51:33.930 --> 00:51:39.550
the PBGC that they are fully
funded, but they also have to

00:51:39.550 --> 00:51:44.160
pay an insurance premium
to the PBGC.

00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:48.140
And if it turns out that they're
not fully funded, then

00:51:48.140 --> 00:51:55.690
the PBGC will come in and
replace the lost income.

00:51:55.690 --> 00:52:00.050
You see, over the century we're
trying to come up with

00:52:00.050 --> 00:52:09.890
financial structures that solve
basic human problems.

00:52:09.890 --> 00:52:13.210
The PBGC, by the way, is still
here, and it hasn't gone

00:52:13.210 --> 00:52:15.560
bankrupt, despite this
financial crisis.

00:52:15.560 --> 00:52:17.950
Though people were worried
about it, it

00:52:17.950 --> 00:52:21.530
has managed to survive.

00:52:21.530 --> 00:52:23.480
After 1974 --

00:52:23.480 --> 00:52:24.990
shortly after this --

00:52:24.990 --> 00:52:31.330
after 1974, a new kind of
pension plan became popular.

00:52:31.330 --> 00:52:36.700
So, ERISA was written in an age
of defined benefit pension

00:52:36.700 --> 00:52:44.070
plans, like the original
American Express pension plan.

00:52:44.070 --> 00:52:46.850
What did American Express
pension plan in

00:52:46.850 --> 00:52:48.770
1875 promise you?

00:52:48.770 --> 00:52:52.060
It promised you half of
your average income

00:52:52.060 --> 00:52:54.490
for the last 10 years.

00:52:54.490 --> 00:52:56.810
And if you're going to fund
the pension plan, you're

00:52:56.810 --> 00:52:59.970
presenting a problem to the
managers of the pension money.

00:52:59.970 --> 00:53:02.040
They have to hit that target.

00:53:02.040 --> 00:53:08.640
They're told, the pension plan
has an obligation to fund the

00:53:08.640 --> 00:53:13.100
payments equal to whatever
percent of last year's income.

00:53:13.100 --> 00:53:15.300
And that's kind of a tricky
problem, if you're a manager.

00:53:15.300 --> 00:53:16.640
How do I do that?

00:53:16.640 --> 00:53:17.870
How do I hit that target?

00:53:17.870 --> 00:53:20.360
How do I know, how much
money to set aside?

00:53:20.360 --> 00:53:23.090
Well, it's getting now into
government regulators, and

00:53:23.090 --> 00:53:28.030
prudent person rules,
and it's tricky.

00:53:28.030 --> 00:53:32.710
But the point is that in 1974,
almost all pension

00:53:32.710 --> 00:53:33.910
plans were like that.

00:53:33.910 --> 00:53:36.090
They defined the benefit
that you would

00:53:36.090 --> 00:53:38.440
receive when you retired.

00:53:38.440 --> 00:53:43.290
But afterwards, in the 1980s,
companies started offering a

00:53:43.290 --> 00:53:47.185
new kind of pension plan, called
a defined contribution.

00:53:50.720 --> 00:53:58.140
The idea was, it's hard for us
to hit that target, of say 50%

00:53:58.140 --> 00:54:00.780
of your average income for
the last 10 years.

00:54:00.780 --> 00:54:02.630
How do you expect
us to do that?

00:54:02.630 --> 00:54:04.830
We don't know, how much these
investments will pay out.

00:54:04.830 --> 00:54:07.410
We don't even know, how much
money you'll be paid in your

00:54:07.410 --> 00:54:08.100
last 10 years.

00:54:08.100 --> 00:54:11.560
So, it's asking us to
do the impossible.

00:54:11.560 --> 00:54:14.100
Well, it's not impossible,
but it is difficult.

00:54:14.100 --> 00:54:20.830
So, many companies decided,
instead of requiring a defined

00:54:20.830 --> 00:54:24.400
amount to be paid, they would
just define the contribution

00:54:24.400 --> 00:54:26.850
they'll make to your
portfolio.

00:54:26.850 --> 00:54:32.870
They give you a portfolio as
an employee, and you get

00:54:32.870 --> 00:54:37.835
whatever income that portfolio
generates when you retire.

00:54:37.835 --> 00:54:42.710
The most famous example of that
is a 401(k) plan in the

00:54:42.710 --> 00:54:44.590
United States.

00:54:44.590 --> 00:54:48.940
But ever since, shortly after
ERISA, the world has been

00:54:48.940 --> 00:54:53.110
moving towards defined
contribution pension plans,

00:54:53.110 --> 00:55:00.080
where a defined contribution
pension plan doesn't promise

00:55:00.080 --> 00:55:01.330
what you'll get in retirement.

00:55:09.250 --> 00:55:12.680
So then, a portfolio manager
for a defined contribution

00:55:12.680 --> 00:55:17.640
pension plan doesn't have to
worry about hitting targets.

00:55:17.640 --> 00:55:20.410
And in fact, the way defined
contribution plans are usually

00:55:20.410 --> 00:55:24.760
set up, they give the individual
employee the choice

00:55:24.760 --> 00:55:27.840
of the main portfolio allocation
between stocks and

00:55:27.840 --> 00:55:31.950
bonds and real estate,
or whatever.

00:55:31.950 --> 00:55:35.180
But you have investment managers
managing within one

00:55:35.180 --> 00:55:36.500
of those asset classes.

00:55:36.500 --> 00:55:41.200
So, there will be someone
managing an equity fund,

00:55:41.200 --> 00:55:45.400
another one managing a bond
fund, and they try to do as

00:55:45.400 --> 00:55:49.510
well as they can as investors,
subject to the restriction of

00:55:49.510 --> 00:55:54.390
what they invest in, and it's
left to the client to choose

00:55:54.390 --> 00:55:56.950
the allocation.

00:55:56.950 --> 00:55:59.720
Defined contribution plans
are going through

00:55:59.720 --> 00:56:01.310
growing pains, too.

00:56:01.310 --> 00:56:03.710
We still don't have the
perfect system.

00:56:03.710 --> 00:56:06.720
The problem with defined
contribution plans --

00:56:06.720 --> 00:56:13.090
one problem is, that you don't
have to sign up for them, the

00:56:13.090 --> 00:56:14.420
way they've been set up.

00:56:14.420 --> 00:56:17.700
It used to be, under the old
days, defined benefit plans,

00:56:17.700 --> 00:56:22.010
it was just automatically, every
employee would get the

00:56:22.010 --> 00:56:23.140
pension plan.

00:56:23.140 --> 00:56:25.940
But with a defined contribution
plan, the typical

00:56:25.940 --> 00:56:31.980
rule was, that the company
would ask you to make

00:56:31.980 --> 00:56:35.340
contributions out of your
paycheck to the plan, and the

00:56:35.340 --> 00:56:37.990
company with then match them,
typically, with additional

00:56:37.990 --> 00:56:39.800
contributions.

00:56:39.800 --> 00:56:43.100
But something like a quarter of
the people would choose not

00:56:43.100 --> 00:56:45.970
to participate --

00:56:45.970 --> 00:56:47.860
that's, because they're not
thinking, they're not

00:56:47.860 --> 00:56:49.180
thinking ahead --

00:56:49.180 --> 00:56:51.240
and so, when they come to
retire, they don't have any

00:56:51.240 --> 00:56:54.030
pension plan.

00:56:54.030 --> 00:56:56.100
Moreover, some of them
take the most

00:56:56.100 --> 00:56:57.500
risky investment offered.

00:56:57.500 --> 00:57:00.330
They might put it all in the
stock market, and if the stock

00:57:00.330 --> 00:57:03.695
market does badly, they might
end up poor in retirement.

00:57:06.820 --> 00:57:11.580
And companies generally would
not give any advice to the

00:57:11.580 --> 00:57:14.290
people, who were employees,
because they didn't want to be

00:57:14.290 --> 00:57:16.620
liable for giving bad advice.

00:57:16.620 --> 00:57:18.300
So, it led to kind
of an amateur

00:57:18.300 --> 00:57:20.920
investing for pension plans.

00:57:23.910 --> 00:57:34.740
So, there has been work to try
to fix that, and I think

00:57:34.740 --> 00:57:38.000
federal legislation has made
it easier for companies to

00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:40.910
give advice to employees.

00:57:40.910 --> 00:57:43.590
They've also allowed, recently,
in the last few

00:57:43.590 --> 00:57:47.240
years, for companies to
automatically enroll employees

00:57:47.240 --> 00:57:58.880
in a pension plan, and allow
them to make allocations, if

00:57:58.880 --> 00:58:01.030
they didn't hear anything
from the employees.

00:58:01.030 --> 00:58:05.070
In other words, they'll put you
into a prudent allocation,

00:58:05.070 --> 00:58:06.720
and then you're actually
there.

00:58:06.720 --> 00:58:08.720
You're in it, because
you've said nothing.

00:58:13.030 --> 00:58:16.020
That's working towards
solving the problem.

00:58:16.020 --> 00:58:19.380
We still don't have, I think,
the ideal solution to any of

00:58:19.380 --> 00:58:20.630
these things.

00:58:23.280 --> 00:58:24.950
So, I've talked about
pension plans.

00:58:24.950 --> 00:58:29.080
Let me move on to endowments.

00:58:29.080 --> 00:58:35.470
Endowment managers, of which
David Swensen is one.

00:58:35.470 --> 00:58:42.280
So, an endowment manages a
portfolio for some cause or

00:58:42.280 --> 00:58:47.360
some purpose, like
a university.

00:58:47.360 --> 00:58:55.280
And the history of endowments
is one of great --

00:58:55.280 --> 00:59:00.260
it's just amazing to me, how
many serious mistakes were

00:59:00.260 --> 00:59:04.400
made in history, but we're
gradually becoming more

00:59:04.400 --> 00:59:05.570
professional.

00:59:05.570 --> 00:59:09.860
So, I give you an example
of a mistake.

00:59:09.860 --> 00:59:14.550
This is in Swensen's book.

00:59:14.550 --> 00:59:21.230
In 1825, Yale University put
its entire endowment in an

00:59:21.230 --> 00:59:23.830
investment in the Eagle
Bank of New Haven.

00:59:26.490 --> 00:59:29.220
You know what happened?

00:59:29.220 --> 00:59:30.940
It went to zero.

00:59:30.940 --> 00:59:32.590
It ended up with nothing.

00:59:32.590 --> 00:59:37.190
So, Yale had no endowment
after 1825.

00:59:37.190 --> 00:59:42.460
So, Elihu Yale may have given
us money, and we should have

00:59:42.460 --> 00:59:46.440
turned it into a pretty tidy
sum, compound interest from

00:59:46.440 --> 00:59:50.790
1700 to 1825, but we
blew it completely.

00:59:50.790 --> 00:59:53.180
This is the first thing you
learn, in a portfolio you

00:59:53.180 --> 00:59:57.020
don't put all of your money
in one investment.

00:59:57.020 --> 00:59:59.310
But Yale University did that.

00:59:59.310 --> 01:00:03.690
By the way, I was looking it
up, 1825 was the year that

01:00:03.690 --> 01:00:08.190
Yale College introduced the
economics requirement, or they

01:00:08.190 --> 01:00:10.640
called it political economy.

01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:13.840
Before that there were no
economics courses at Yale.

01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:16.110
But maybe it was this experience
that made them do

01:00:16.110 --> 01:00:20.870
that in 1825.

01:00:20.870 --> 01:00:24.010
So, I'm going to give
you another example.

01:00:24.010 --> 01:00:25.620
Boston University --

01:00:25.620 --> 01:00:27.190
this is much more recent --

01:00:27.190 --> 01:00:32.070
under John Silber, invested not
the whole endowment of the

01:00:32.070 --> 01:00:36.380
university, but $90 million in
one company called Seragen,

01:00:36.380 --> 01:00:40.880
which was a genetic engineering
company.

01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:45.890
And just John Silber decided to
do this, and he lost Boston

01:00:45.890 --> 01:00:56.240
University 90% of $90 million.

01:00:56.240 --> 01:01:00.750
University of Bridgeport, not
far from here, blew its whole

01:01:00.750 --> 01:01:07.280
endowment, and ended up having
to join the Unification Church

01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:08.280
to survive.

01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:10.300
I think that somehow that's
been undone since then.

01:01:10.300 --> 01:01:13.670
I'm not sure of the details.

01:01:13.670 --> 01:01:16.500
It may not have been, what they
would have done, if they

01:01:16.500 --> 01:01:17.890
had had an endowment.

01:01:17.890 --> 01:01:21.320
See, what Swenson thinks is,
what he's doing is protecting

01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:27.180
the ability of a university to
undergo its financial mission.

01:01:27.180 --> 01:01:33.240
And so, because Swenson was
not overly constrained by

01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:38.430
prudent person rules, because
he was free to invest in a

01:01:38.430 --> 01:01:42.345
high intellectual standard, he's
made it possible for Yale

01:01:42.345 --> 01:01:46.050
to pursue its educational
objectives.

01:01:46.050 --> 01:01:49.250
Right now at Yale University,
like other successful

01:01:49.250 --> 01:01:53.380
endowment universities, graduate
students get their

01:01:53.380 --> 01:01:57.750
whole tuition paid, plus
a living allowance.

01:01:57.750 --> 01:02:01.890
It's like a job, coming to
be a graduate student.

01:02:01.890 --> 01:02:03.510
The university pays --

01:02:03.510 --> 01:02:04.800
you should know this,
if you're thinking

01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:07.190
of getting a PhD.

01:02:07.190 --> 01:02:09.000
Come to one of these
universities, and they'll pay

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:13.200
you something like $25,000
a year, something

01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:14.450
like that to --

01:02:17.810 --> 01:02:19.500
that's a pretty good deal.

01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:22.130
It's not a deal, it's a gift.

01:02:22.130 --> 01:02:26.030
It's the generosity of the
alumni, and it's the success

01:02:26.030 --> 01:02:28.360
of the investment strategy
that makes that possible.

01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:36.310
And then, I wanted to talk
about another kind of

01:02:36.310 --> 01:02:41.680
institutional investor, and this
will bring me back to my

01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:48.360
discussion of the family.

01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:52.600
I started out by saying that the
family is the fundamental

01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:54.530
unit of our society.

01:02:54.530 --> 01:02:56.790
Its demise has been predicted.

01:02:56.790 --> 01:03:01.660
Remember that in the Communist
Manifesto, Karl Marx said

01:03:01.660 --> 01:03:04.080
we're going to end the family
as an economic unit?

01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:05.120
Something like that.

01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:07.840
Didn't happen.

01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:14.730
It's too ingrained in our genes
or our long history.

01:03:14.730 --> 01:03:18.790
So, I thought, I should come
back and talk about family

01:03:18.790 --> 01:03:28.440
offices and family foundations,
although these

01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:31.520
apply only to the more wealthy
people in our society.

01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:33.870
What is a family office?

01:03:33.870 --> 01:03:35.120
These are --

01:03:38.570 --> 01:03:41.110
people who have $100
million or more

01:03:41.110 --> 01:03:42.130
typically set these up.

01:03:42.130 --> 01:03:42.980
Maybe even less.

01:03:42.980 --> 01:03:46.270
Maybe, with $20 million
in assets.

01:03:46.270 --> 01:03:51.900
But if you have $100 million
in assets, 5% income is $5

01:03:51.900 --> 01:03:53.150
million a year, right?

01:03:57.130 --> 01:04:03.140
It would be sensible to take on
some full-time employees to

01:04:03.140 --> 01:04:05.860
manage your family portfolio,
and so that's

01:04:05.860 --> 01:04:09.860
called a family office.

01:04:09.860 --> 01:04:15.970
I recently spoke at a family
office forum, down in Florida.

01:04:15.970 --> 01:04:17.510
They seemed to be
very numerous.

01:04:17.510 --> 01:04:19.600
There's an awful lot
of families.

01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:22.650
The families come to these
conventions, and they hear

01:04:22.650 --> 01:04:24.110
people like me speak.

01:04:24.110 --> 01:04:26.260
Although I'm different than most
of them, because most of

01:04:26.260 --> 01:04:29.310
the people speaking there wanted
to sell products, and I

01:04:29.310 --> 01:04:30.560
wasn't there to sell anything.

01:04:34.540 --> 01:04:37.390
So, they typically have two or
three or five people working

01:04:37.390 --> 01:04:40.670
full-time, managing their
portfolio and planning things

01:04:40.670 --> 01:04:41.985
like trusts for the children.

01:04:45.700 --> 01:04:47.480
And then, there's something
else called a family

01:04:47.480 --> 01:04:48.180
foundation.

01:04:48.180 --> 01:04:51.630
A family office is for the
family, and there's something

01:04:51.630 --> 01:04:54.090
else called a family
foundation.

01:04:56.780 --> 01:05:00.900
And this is different from a
family office, but they could

01:05:00.900 --> 01:05:03.720
be interrelated, and I
think most wealthy

01:05:03.720 --> 01:05:05.280
families have both.

01:05:05.280 --> 01:05:09.770
A family foundation is a
charitable organization,

01:05:09.770 --> 01:05:15.830
created by a family with the
name of the family typically

01:05:15.830 --> 01:05:17.080
on the foundation.

01:05:24.280 --> 01:05:28.070
I think that most wealthy
familes -- or actually, I

01:05:28.070 --> 01:05:28.270
don't know.

01:05:28.270 --> 01:05:30.420
A large number of wealthy
families, at least in the

01:05:30.420 --> 01:05:33.500
United States, now set up
family foundations.

01:05:33.500 --> 01:05:35.720
And the reason they do that --

01:05:35.720 --> 01:05:37.400
well, why do they do that?

01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:39.320
I think it's partly, because,
when you're wealthy, you

01:05:39.320 --> 01:05:43.950
realize that you can't spend
it all on yourself.

01:05:43.950 --> 01:05:49.670
And you reflect on yourself
as a member of society.

01:05:49.670 --> 01:05:53.050
As people get older, they think,
what am I going to do

01:05:53.050 --> 01:05:56.170
with this money?

01:05:56.170 --> 01:06:00.310
So increasingly, people are
setting up family foundations.

01:06:00.310 --> 01:06:07.760
I learned, that, as of 2006,
there were 36,000 family

01:06:07.760 --> 01:06:10.630
foundations in the United
States, and

01:06:10.630 --> 01:06:11.690
it's growing rapidly.

01:06:11.690 --> 01:06:13.950
There seems to be a trend
toward that, I think,

01:06:13.950 --> 01:06:17.070
reflecting our increasing
affluence, but, I think also,

01:06:17.070 --> 01:06:21.770
reflecting maybe changing
values.

01:06:21.770 --> 01:06:24.440
So, the typical family
foundation is not huge.

01:06:24.440 --> 01:06:27.570
It might be $1 million
or $2 million.

01:06:27.570 --> 01:06:30.836
So, you can set something like
that up, eventually --

01:06:30.836 --> 01:06:32.100
not right now --

01:06:32.100 --> 01:06:34.250
I want you to think
about doing that.

01:06:34.250 --> 01:06:37.760
So, whatever it is you believe
in, you set up a family

01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:41.779
foundation to do that, while
you're still young, and you

01:06:41.779 --> 01:06:44.830
get it going, and it will
then outlive you.

01:06:44.830 --> 01:06:48.100
And you endow it, you give it
enough -- say, you give it a

01:06:48.100 --> 01:06:49.910
couple million dollars.

01:06:49.910 --> 01:06:51.590
That would be a small
family foundation,

01:06:51.590 --> 01:06:53.520
but you can do that.

01:06:53.520 --> 01:06:58.270
And then, there's some named
cause, like it could be

01:06:58.270 --> 01:07:04.609
improving neighborhoods in
our city or the like.

01:07:04.609 --> 01:07:10.800
And family foundations,
I think there's an

01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:13.550
important tax advantage.

01:07:13.550 --> 01:07:15.790
You don't want to think about
this yet, but you should start

01:07:15.790 --> 01:07:17.250
thinking about it.

01:07:17.250 --> 01:07:21.670
When you start making money,
assuming that happens, what do

01:07:21.670 --> 01:07:22.680
you do with it?

01:07:22.680 --> 01:07:25.990
Now, you're pulling in a
million dollars a year.

01:07:25.990 --> 01:07:28.990
That's something that
you might well do.

01:07:28.990 --> 01:07:36.960
And so, I can just put in the
bank and not think about it?

01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:39.910
One problem is, the government
will tax you on it.

01:07:39.910 --> 01:07:43.260
And you get a charitable
deduction from your tax, which

01:07:43.260 --> 01:07:45.810
encourages you to give
to charities.

01:07:45.810 --> 01:07:46.300
All right.

01:07:46.300 --> 01:07:49.870
So, you're now 30 years old,
and you're making a million

01:07:49.870 --> 01:07:51.189
dollars a year.

01:07:51.189 --> 01:07:52.700
And what do I do with
all this money?

01:07:52.700 --> 01:07:53.870
I'm paying taxes on it.

01:07:53.870 --> 01:07:55.649
If I give it away, I
get a tax break.

01:07:55.649 --> 01:07:57.779
So, there's an incentive
to give away.

01:07:57.779 --> 01:07:59.990
You're getting all these phone
calls at night from --

01:07:59.990 --> 01:08:02.029
they found out that
you exist --

01:08:02.029 --> 01:08:06.609
from United Fund or different
charitable organizations.

01:08:06.609 --> 01:08:08.870
But you stopped answering the
phone, because you're annoyed

01:08:08.870 --> 01:08:12.029
by all these phone calls, and
you're thinking, I don't want

01:08:12.029 --> 01:08:13.690
to just give it away to
someone that called

01:08:13.690 --> 01:08:14.570
me up on the phone.

01:08:14.570 --> 01:08:16.390
I want to think about
what I'm --

01:08:16.390 --> 01:08:19.620
I want to do something
for the world.

01:08:19.620 --> 01:08:22.360
The idea is that, while you're
still young, you set up a

01:08:22.360 --> 01:08:25.960
family foundation, and you
give the money to the

01:08:25.960 --> 01:08:28.230
foundation irrevocably.

01:08:28.230 --> 01:08:28.710
All right?

01:08:28.710 --> 01:08:31.910
It has a cause written in its
charter or something.

01:08:31.910 --> 01:08:34.890
And then, you don't have
to spend it now.

01:08:34.890 --> 01:08:37.750
You're too busy thinking about
what you're doing, so you

01:08:37.750 --> 01:08:42.860
start contributing to the family
foundation, and it

01:08:42.860 --> 01:08:44.530
accumulates.

01:08:44.530 --> 01:08:49.150
And meanwhile, you're getting
the tax deduction.

01:08:49.150 --> 01:08:52.700
So, that's why 36,000 families
have done this in the United

01:08:52.700 --> 01:08:55.480
States, and I think it's
growing, again,

01:08:55.480 --> 01:08:56.730
over all the world.

01:09:02.920 --> 01:09:05.700
Sometimes, family foundations
are plans for children, too,

01:09:05.700 --> 01:09:09.970
because your children can
then run the foundation.

01:09:09.970 --> 01:09:13.970
It becomes an ongoing thing
for the family that unites

01:09:13.970 --> 01:09:19.340
them in a cause, as
time goes by.

01:09:19.340 --> 01:09:21.350
I think, this is really
important to recognize this

01:09:21.350 --> 01:09:23.380
channel -- although it's only
36,000, that's still

01:09:23.380 --> 01:09:24.390
a lot of them --

01:09:24.390 --> 01:09:27.960
as we think about the growing
inequality in the United

01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:30.490
States and in other places
around the world, and think

01:09:30.490 --> 01:09:32.610
about the policy toward that.

01:09:32.610 --> 01:09:35.550
I think, we should do something
about inequality,

01:09:35.550 --> 01:09:39.360
but I think encouraging this
kind of a family foundation

01:09:39.360 --> 01:09:42.250
activity is a good cause.

01:09:42.250 --> 01:09:43.950
I wanted to just
think about --

01:09:43.950 --> 01:09:45.890
I'm almost done here --

01:09:45.890 --> 01:09:50.440
there's a recent book by a Wall
Street Journal writer,

01:09:50.440 --> 01:09:52.390
Robert Frank, called
Richistan.

01:09:52.390 --> 01:09:56.970
And he talks about rich people
in America and what they do.

01:09:56.970 --> 01:09:59.260
And the book --

01:09:59.260 --> 01:10:03.590
this is Frank, Robert Frank --

01:10:03.590 --> 01:10:09.120
the book talks about excess
that some people do.

01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:13.180
Some rich people spend money
lavishly, and it disgusts

01:10:13.180 --> 01:10:18.730
people, who think, what is
going on in our society?

01:10:18.730 --> 01:10:21.990
But on the other side of
it, there is also this

01:10:21.990 --> 01:10:27.050
philanthropic trend that
Frank talks about.

01:10:27.050 --> 01:10:28.700
So, I'll give you an example.

01:10:28.700 --> 01:10:31.700
Robert Frank talks, for example,
about Paul Allen.

01:10:31.700 --> 01:10:33.960
Remember him?

01:10:33.960 --> 01:10:36.410
I guess, he was the number
two man at Microsoft.

01:10:39.960 --> 01:10:43.380
So, is he a good person?

01:10:43.380 --> 01:10:47.180
Well, I'll give you two sides to
that story, and this I got

01:10:47.180 --> 01:10:48.340
from Richistan.

01:10:48.340 --> 01:10:53.540
Paul Allen wanted to have the
biggest yacht in the world,

01:10:53.540 --> 01:10:55.930
and so he went to a
yacht company, and

01:10:55.930 --> 01:11:03.850
had a 400-foot yacht.

01:11:03.850 --> 01:11:05.540
It turned out, they said --

01:11:05.540 --> 01:11:08.520
it created problems for him,
because he couldn't dock it at

01:11:08.520 --> 01:11:10.080
any yacht club.

01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:15.190
He had to go to industrial docks
for major cargo ships.

01:11:15.190 --> 01:11:18.730
So, that's a big yacht, and
he called it The Octopus.

01:11:24.520 --> 01:11:27.230
Paul Allen has a new book that
just came out, or it's just

01:11:27.230 --> 01:11:29.460
coming out now, called
Idea Man.

01:11:29.460 --> 01:11:34.550
In his own recount of himself,
he had brutal battles and

01:11:34.550 --> 01:11:36.710
arguments with Bill Gates.

01:11:36.710 --> 01:11:38.770
It was a revealing thing.

01:11:38.770 --> 01:11:41.230
They were really in this
for the money.

01:11:41.230 --> 01:11:44.080
So, he's starting to look
like a bad guy, right?

01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:46.582
Because here he is showing off
with the biggest yacht

01:11:46.582 --> 01:11:47.710
in the world --

01:11:47.710 --> 01:11:49.730
and actually, he's been topped
by somebody else.

01:11:49.730 --> 01:11:51.300
Who was it?

01:11:51.300 --> 01:11:56.660
Larry Ellison got a
450-foot yacht.

01:11:56.660 --> 01:11:59.760
But on the other side
of it is, there is

01:11:59.760 --> 01:12:03.000
something called the --

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:19.920
it's the Paul G. Allen Family
Foundation, which he has set

01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:20.520
up already.

01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:23.820
And it turns out, he has already
donated over a billion

01:12:23.820 --> 01:12:25.320
dollars through this
foundation and

01:12:25.320 --> 01:12:26.220
otherwise to charity.

01:12:26.220 --> 01:12:28.620
So, that's much bigger than
the 450-foot octopus.

01:12:28.620 --> 01:12:31.320
What does it cost to buy
a 450-foot yacht?

01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:34.020
I don't know, it's
not going to be a

01:12:34.020 --> 01:12:34.920
billion dollars, right?

01:12:34.920 --> 01:12:38.520
This is one of the ironies that
you face in living, that

01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:41.220
someone like Paul Allen, he's
a tough businessman, an

01:12:41.220 --> 01:12:43.320
aggressive guy, he sometimes
does extravagant expenditures,

01:12:43.320 --> 01:12:46.620
but on the other side, there's
this charitable side, so I

01:12:46.620 --> 01:12:49.320
think we have to reserve
judgment about most people.

01:12:49.320 --> 01:12:52.320
Anyway, what he has working
for him is a great

01:12:52.320 --> 01:12:54.120
understanding, apparently, of
financial arrangements, of

01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:57.420
endowments, and he's setting
these up, and you got to give

01:12:57.420 --> 01:13:01.020
him credit for that, and I think
we have to consider that

01:13:01.020 --> 01:13:01.620
as important.

01:13:01.620 --> 01:13:04.320
Institutional investing is an
important trend in our society

01:13:04.320 --> 01:13:07.320
that can and does work for
important and good purposes.

01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:09.770
I'll see you on Wednesday.

00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:05.807
So, I had to leave you in the
middle of something pretty

00:00:05.807 --> 00:00:09.920
exciting, so I'll come back and
take it from there.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.100
So, what is it you have to
remember from last time?

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.149
You know, what are the main
ideas I covered?

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:19.850
One is, we took the notion of
temperature, for which we have

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:23.173
an intuitive feeling and turned
it into something more

00:00:23.173 --> 00:00:25.555
quantitative,
so you can not only say this is

00:00:25.555 --> 00:00:27.294
hotter than that,
that's hotter than this,

00:00:27.294 --> 00:00:29.910
you can say by how much,
by how many degrees.

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.766
And in the end we agreed to use
the absolute Kelvin scale for

00:00:34.766 --> 00:00:38.476
temperature.
And the way to find the Kelvin

00:00:38.476 --> 00:00:42.600
scale, you take the gas,
any gas that you like,

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.191
like hydrogen or helium,
at low concentration,

00:00:47.191 --> 00:00:51.680
and put that inside a piston
and cylinder.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.355
That will occupy some volume
and there's a certain pressure

00:00:55.355 --> 00:00:59.306
by putting weights on top,
and you take the product of

00:00:59.306 --> 00:01:03.579
P times V,
and the claim is for whatever

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:06.710
gas you take,
it'll be a straight line.

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.288
Remember now, this is in Kelvin.
Your centigrade scale is

00:01:10.288 --> 00:01:13.389
somewhere over here,
but I've shifted the origin to

00:01:13.389 --> 00:01:16.355
the Kelvin scale.
So, somewhere here will be the

00:01:16.355 --> 00:01:19.462
boiling point of water,
somewhere the freezing point of

00:01:19.462 --> 00:01:21.779
water;
that may be the boiling point

00:01:21.779 --> 00:01:24.286
of water.
And if you took a different

00:01:24.286 --> 00:01:28.129
amount of a different gas,
you'll get some other line.

00:01:28.129 --> 00:01:31.342
But they will always be
straight lines if the

00:01:31.342 --> 00:01:33.970
concentration is sufficiently
low.

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.531
In other words,
it appears that pressure times

00:01:37.531 --> 00:01:41.010
volume is some constant.
I don't know what to call it.

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.810
Say c,
times this temperature.

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.506
And you can use that to measure
temperature because if you know

00:01:51.506 --> 00:01:54.492
two points on a straight line
then you know that you can find

00:01:54.492 --> 00:01:57.330
the slope and then you can
calibrate the thermometer,

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.853
then for any other value of
P times V that you

00:02:00.853 --> 00:02:03.900
get, you can come down and read
your temperature.

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.835
That's the preferred scale,
and we prefer this scale

00:02:06.835 --> 00:02:10.290
because it doesn't seem to
depend on the gas that you use.

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:12.270
I can use one;
you can use another one.

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.275
People in another planet who
have never heard of water--they

00:02:15.275 --> 00:02:18.557
can use a different gas.
But all gases seem to have the

00:02:18.557 --> 00:02:22.406
property that pressure times
volume is linearly proportional

00:02:22.406 --> 00:02:26.225
to this new temperature scale,
measured with this new origin

00:02:26.225 --> 00:02:28.870
at absolute zero.
There is really nothing to the

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.320
left of this T = 0.

00:02:33.669 --> 00:02:37.780
The next thing I mentioned was,
people used to think of the

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.999
theory of heat as a new theory.
You know, we got mechanics and

00:02:41.999 --> 00:02:45.069
all that stuff--levers and
pulleys and all that.

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:47.479
Then, you have this mysterious
thing called heat,

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:50.190
which has been around for many
years but people started

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.402
quantifying it by saying there's
a fluid called the caloric fluid

00:02:53.402 --> 00:02:56.916
and hot things have a lot of it,
and cold things have less of

00:02:56.916 --> 00:03:00.300
it, and when you mix them the
caloric somehow flows from the

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.574
hot to the cold.
Then we defined specific heat,

00:03:03.574 --> 00:03:07.871
law of conservation of this
caloric fluid that allows you to

00:03:07.871 --> 00:03:11.857
do some problems in calorimetry.
You mix so much of this with so

00:03:11.857 --> 00:03:13.620
much of that,
where will they end up?

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.382
That kind of problem.
So, that promoted heat to a new

00:03:17.382 --> 00:03:21.759
and independent entity,
different from all other things

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:25.220
we have studied.
But something suggests that it

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.252
is not completely alien or a new
concept, because there seems to

00:03:29.252 --> 00:03:31.939
be a conservation of law for
this heat,

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:35.517
because the heat lost by the
cold water was the heat gained

00:03:35.517 --> 00:03:37.400
by the hot water.
I'm sorry.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.451
Heat gained by the cold water
was the heat lost by the hot

00:03:40.451 --> 00:03:42.599
water.
So, you have a conservation law.

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:47.509
Secondly, we know another way
to produce heat.

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:50.457
Instead of saying put it on the
stove, put it on the stove,

00:03:50.457 --> 00:03:52.642
in which case,
there is something mysterious

00:03:52.642 --> 00:03:55.639
flowing from the stove into the
water that heats it up,

00:03:55.639 --> 00:03:58.020
I told you there's a different
thing you can do.

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:01.740
Take two automobiles;
slam them.

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:06.191
This is not the most economical
way to make your dinner but I'm

00:04:06.191 --> 00:04:09.349
just telling you as a matter of
principle.

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:12.361
Buy two Ferraris,
slam them into each other and

00:04:12.361 --> 00:04:16.027
take this pot and put it on top
and it'll heat up because

00:04:16.027 --> 00:04:19.214
Ferraris will heat up.
The question is what happened

00:04:19.214 --> 00:04:21.210
to the kinetic energy of the two
cars?

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:23.670
That is really gone.
So, in the old days,

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:26.002
we would say,
well, we don't apply the Law of

00:04:26.002 --> 00:04:28.705
Conservation of Energy because
this was an inelastic

00:04:28.705 --> 00:04:31.481
relationship.
That was our legal way out of

00:04:31.481 --> 00:04:34.219
the whole issue.
But you realize now this

00:04:34.219 --> 00:04:37.140
caloric fluid can be produced
from nowhere,

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:40.269
because there was no caloric
fluid before,

00:04:40.269 --> 00:04:43.940
but slamming the two cars
produce this extra heat.

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:47.480
So, that indicates that perhaps
there's a relation between

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.833
mechanical energy and heat
energy--that when mechanical

00:04:50.833 --> 00:04:54.060
energy disappears,
heat energy appears.

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.949
So, how do you do the
conversion ratio?

00:04:56.949 --> 00:05:00.201
You know, how many calories can
you get if you sacrifice one

00:05:00.201 --> 00:05:03.490
joule of mechanical energy?
So, Joule did the experiment.

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:06.299
Not with cars.
I mean, he didn't have cars at

00:05:06.299 --> 00:05:08.854
that time, so if he did he
would've probably done it with

00:05:08.854 --> 00:05:11.347
cars.
He had this gadget with him,

00:05:11.347 --> 00:05:15.906
which is a little shaft with
some paddles and a pulley on the

00:05:15.906 --> 00:05:18.870
top, and you let the weight go
down.

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:22.392
And I told you guys the weight
goes from here to here,

00:05:22.392 --> 00:05:26.580
the mgh loss will not be
the gain in ½ mv^(2).

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:29.177
Something will be missing.
Keep track of the missing

00:05:29.177 --> 00:05:31.131
amount.
So many joules--but meanwhile

00:05:31.131 --> 00:05:33.069
you find this water has become
hot.

00:05:33.069 --> 00:05:36.225
You find then how many calories
should have gone in,

00:05:36.225 --> 00:05:38.699
because we know the specific of
water,

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:40.869
we know the rise in
temperature, we know how many

00:05:40.869 --> 00:05:44.601
calories were produced.
And then, you compare the two

00:05:44.601 --> 00:05:48.370
and you find that 4.2 joules = 1
calorie.

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:55.930
So, that is the conversion
ratio of calories to joules.

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:58.759
One joule, 4.2 joules of
mechanical energy.

00:05:58.759 --> 00:06:01.140
So, in the example of the
colliding cars,

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:04.651
take the ½ mv^(2) for
each car, turn it into joules,

00:06:04.651 --> 00:06:07.520
slam them together.
If they come to rest,

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:11.377
you've lost all of that,
and then you take that and you

00:06:11.377 --> 00:06:15.592
write it as--divided by 4.2 and
that's how much calories you

00:06:15.592 --> 00:06:18.463
have produced.
If the car was made of just one

00:06:18.463 --> 00:06:21.246
material, it had a specific
heat, then it would go up by a

00:06:21.246 --> 00:06:23.590
certain temperature you can
actually predict.

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:27.918
Okay.
So today, I want to go a little

00:06:27.918 --> 00:06:32.600
deeper into the question of
where is the energy actually

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:35.920
stored in the car,
and what is heat.

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:37.410
We still don't know in detail
what heat is.

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:40.784
We just said car heats up and
the loss of joules divided by

00:06:40.784 --> 00:06:46.483
4.2 is the gain in calories.
Now, we can answer in detail

00:06:46.483 --> 00:06:50.921
exactly what is heat.
That's what we're going to talk

00:06:50.921 --> 00:06:52.800
about today.
When we say something is

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:55.440
hotter, what do we mean on a
microscopic level?

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:58.147
In the old days when people
didn't know what anything was

00:06:58.147 --> 00:07:00.420
made of, they didn't have this
understanding.

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:03.753
And the understanding that I'm
going to give you today is based

00:07:03.753 --> 00:07:06.709
on a simple fact that everything
is made up of atoms.

00:07:06.709 --> 00:07:09.711
That was not known,
and that's one of the greatest

00:07:09.711 --> 00:07:11.610
discoveries that,
in the end,

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:14.438
everything is made up of atoms,
and atoms combine to form

00:07:14.438 --> 00:07:17.709
molecules and so on.
So, how does that come into

00:07:17.709 --> 00:07:19.949
play?
For that, I want you to take

00:07:19.949 --> 00:07:23.029
the simple example where the
temperature enters.

00:07:23.029 --> 00:07:27.386
That is in the relation
PV equal to some constant

00:07:27.386 --> 00:07:31.146
times temperature.
Do you know what I'm talking

00:07:31.146 --> 00:07:32.676
about?
Take some gas,

00:07:32.676 --> 00:07:36.833
make sure it's sufficiently
dilute, put it into this piston,

00:07:36.833 --> 00:07:39.370
measure the weights on top of
it,

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:41.414
divide it by the area,
to get the pressure,

00:07:41.414 --> 00:07:43.410
that's the pressure,
that's the volume.

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:48.139
The volume is the region here,
multiply the product;

00:07:48.139 --> 00:07:52.073
then, if you heat up the gas by
putting it on some hot plate,

00:07:52.073 --> 00:07:55.089
you'll find the product
PV increases,

00:07:55.089 --> 00:07:57.421
and as the temperature
increases, PV is

00:07:57.421 --> 00:08:01.626
proportional to T.
We want to ask what is this

00:08:01.626 --> 00:08:05.839
proportionality constant.
Suppose you were doing this.

00:08:05.839 --> 00:08:07.610
In the old days,
this is what people did.

00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:12.240
What did we think should be on
the right-hand side?

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:16.451
What is going to control this
particular constant for the

00:08:16.451 --> 00:08:20.431
given experiment?
Do you know what it might be

00:08:20.431 --> 00:08:23.520
proportional to?
Yes?

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:25.167
Student: Amount of gas?
Professor Ramamurti

00:08:25.167 --> 00:08:26.370
Shankar: Amount of gas.
That's true,

00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:28.379
because if the amount of gas is
zero, we think there's no

00:08:28.379 --> 00:08:30.972
pressure.
When you say "amount of gas,"

00:08:30.972 --> 00:08:35.298
that's a very safe sentence
because amount measured by what

00:08:35.298 --> 00:08:37.100
means?
By what metric?

00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:41.169
Student: Probably number
of particles?

00:08:41.169 --> 00:08:42.879
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Right.

00:08:42.879 --> 00:08:44.929
Suppose you were not aware of
particles.

00:08:44.929 --> 00:08:47.050
Then, what would you mean by
"amount of gas?"

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:49.721
Student: Mass.
Professor Ramamurti

00:08:49.721 --> 00:08:51.602
Shankar: The mass.
Now, if you guys ever said

00:08:51.602 --> 00:08:53.769
moles, I was going to shoot you
down.

00:08:53.769 --> 00:08:55.660
You're not supposed to know
those things.

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:58.442
We are trying to deduce that.
So, put yourself back in

00:08:58.442 --> 00:09:01.720
whatever stone ages we were in.
We don't know anything else.

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:04.000
Mass would be a reasonable
argument, right?

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.404
What's the argument?
We know that if you have some

00:09:07.404 --> 00:09:10.716
amount of gas producing the
pressure, and you put twice as

00:09:10.716 --> 00:09:12.645
much stuff,
you would think it will produce

00:09:12.645 --> 00:09:14.934
twice as much pressure.
Same reason why you think the

00:09:14.934 --> 00:09:17.145
expansion of a rod is
proportionally change in

00:09:17.145 --> 00:09:19.159
temperature times the starting
length.

00:09:19.159 --> 00:09:21.760
So, this mass is what's doing
it.

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:24.480
So, it's proportional to mass.
It's a very reasonable guess.

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:26.944
So, if you put more gas into
your piston you think it'll

00:09:26.944 --> 00:09:29.529
produce more pressure.
That's actually correct.

00:09:29.529 --> 00:09:33.273
So, let's go to that one
particular sample in your

00:09:33.273 --> 00:09:36.943
laboratory that you did.
So, put the mass that you had

00:09:36.943 --> 00:09:38.997
there.
Then, you should put a constant

00:09:38.997 --> 00:09:40.665
still.
I don't know what you want me

00:09:40.665 --> 00:09:42.629
to call this constant,
say, c prime.

00:09:42.629 --> 00:09:46.400
This constant contains
everything, but I pulled out the

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:50.870
mass and the remaining constant
I want to call c prime.

00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:55.234
This is actually correct.
You can take a certain gas and

00:09:55.234 --> 00:09:57.400
you can find out what c
prime is.

00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:02.537
But here is what people found.
If you do it that way,

00:10:02.537 --> 00:10:05.446
the constant c prime
depends on the gas you are

00:10:05.446 --> 00:10:08.774
considering.
If you consider hydrogen gas,

00:10:08.774 --> 00:10:12.659
let's call that c prime
for hydrogen.

00:10:12.659 --> 00:10:15.559
Somebody else puts in helium
gas.

00:10:15.559 --> 00:10:20.652
Then you find the c
prime for helium is one-fourth

00:10:20.652 --> 00:10:23.380
c prime for hydrogen.

00:10:28.009 --> 00:10:31.120
If you do carbon,
it's another number.

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:36.743
c prime for carbon is
c prime for hydrogen

00:10:36.743 --> 00:10:43.022
divided by 12.
So, each gas has a different

00:10:43.022 --> 00:10:46.457
constant.
So, we conclude that yes,

00:10:46.457 --> 00:10:50.652
it's the mass that decides it
but the mass has to be divided

00:10:50.652 --> 00:10:54.634
by different numbers for
different gases to find the real

00:10:54.634 --> 00:10:57.549
effective mass in terms of
pressure.

00:10:57.549 --> 00:11:01.243
In other words,
one gram of hydrogen and one

00:11:01.243 --> 00:11:05.279
gram of helium do not have the
same pressure.

00:11:05.279 --> 00:11:12.250
In fact, one gram of helium has
to be divided by 4 to find its

00:11:12.250 --> 00:11:16.300
effect on pressure.
So, you have to think about why

00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:18.750
is it that the mass directly is
not involved.

00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:21.363
Mass has to be divided by a
number, and the number is a

00:11:21.363 --> 00:11:23.841
nice, round number.
4 for this and 12 for that,

00:11:23.841 --> 00:11:27.253
and of course people figure out
there's a long story I cannot go

00:11:27.253 --> 00:11:29.690
into, but I think you all know
the answer.

00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:32.931
But now we are allowed to fast
forward to the correct answer,

00:11:32.931 --> 00:11:36.227
because I really don't have the
time to see how they worked it

00:11:36.227 --> 00:11:38.491
out,
but from these integers and the

00:11:38.491 --> 00:11:41.799
way the gases reacted and formed
complicated molecules,

00:11:41.799 --> 00:11:45.617
they figured out what's really
going on is that you're dividing

00:11:45.617 --> 00:11:49.434
by a number that's proportional
with the mass of the underlying

00:11:49.434 --> 00:11:51.970
fundamental entity,
which would be an atom.

00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:54.188
In some case a molecule,
but I'm just going to call

00:11:54.188 --> 00:11:56.241
everything as atom.
So, if things,

00:11:56.241 --> 00:11:59.446
like, carbon,
as atoms, weigh 12 times as

00:11:59.446 --> 00:12:04.359
much as things called hydrogen,
then if you took some amount of

00:12:04.359 --> 00:12:07.113
carbon, you divide it by a
number, like,

00:12:07.113 --> 00:12:10.080
12 to count the number of
carbon atoms.

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:12.965
Okay, so hydrogen you want to
count the number of hydrogen

00:12:12.965 --> 00:12:15.923
atoms.
So then, what really you want

00:12:15.923 --> 00:12:20.237
here is not the mass,
but the number of atoms of a

00:12:20.237 --> 00:12:23.425
given kind.
We are certainly free to write

00:12:23.425 --> 00:12:27.076
either a mass or the number of
atoms, because the two are

00:12:27.076 --> 00:12:29.901
proportional.
But the beauty of writing it

00:12:29.901 --> 00:12:33.655
this way, you write it in this
fashion, by this new constant

00:12:33.655 --> 00:12:36.710
k, k is
independent of the gas.

00:12:41.129 --> 00:12:43.623
So, you want to write it in a
manner in which it doesn't

00:12:43.623 --> 00:12:46.671
depend on the gas.
You can write it in terms of

00:12:46.671 --> 00:12:48.171
mass.
If you did, for each mass

00:12:48.171 --> 00:12:49.919
you've got to divide by a
certain number.

00:12:49.919 --> 00:12:53.325
TThen once you divide it by the
number you can put a single

00:12:53.325 --> 00:12:56.281
constant in front.
Or if you want a universal

00:12:56.281 --> 00:13:00.392
constant, what you should really
be counting is the number of

00:13:00.392 --> 00:13:01.900
atoms or molecules.

00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:07.496
So, you couldn't have written
it that way until you knew about

00:13:07.496 --> 00:13:09.750
atoms and molecules and people
who are led to atoms and

00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:11.879
molecules by looking at the way
gases interact,

00:13:11.879 --> 00:13:16.113
and it's a beautiful piece of
chemistry to figure out really

00:13:16.113 --> 00:13:20.059
that there are entities which
come in discreet units.

00:13:20.059 --> 00:13:22.813
Not at all obvious in the old
days, that mass comes in

00:13:22.813 --> 00:13:25.929
discreet units called atoms,
but that's what they deduced.

00:13:25.929 --> 00:13:29.309
So, this is called the
Boltzmann Constant.

00:13:29.309 --> 00:13:38.222
The Boltzmann Constant has a
value of 1.4 times 10^(-23),

00:13:38.222 --> 00:13:42.520
let's see, joules/Kelvin.

00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:53.693
That's it.
Or joules/Kelvin or degrees

00:13:53.693 --> 00:13:54.610
centigrade.

00:14:01.639 --> 00:14:02.950
So, this is a universal
constant.

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:11.803
So, now what people like to do
is they don't like to write the

00:14:11.803 --> 00:14:14.340
number [N], because if you write
the number,

00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:18.770
in a typical situation,
what's the number going to be?

00:14:18.770 --> 00:14:21.737
Take some random group gas.
One gram, two grams,

00:14:21.737 --> 00:14:23.299
one kilogram,
it doesn't matter.

00:14:23.299 --> 00:14:26.303
The number you will put in
there is some number like

00:14:26.303 --> 00:14:30.730
10^(23) or 10^(25).
That's a huge number.

00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:34.540
So, whenever a huge number is
involved, what you try to do is

00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:38.541
to measure the huge number as a
simple multiple off another huge

00:14:38.541 --> 00:14:40.584
number,
which will be our units for

00:14:40.584 --> 00:14:42.615
measuring large numbers.
For example,

00:14:42.615 --> 00:14:45.889
when you want to buy eggs,
you measure in dozens.

00:14:45.889 --> 00:14:48.357
When you want to buy paper,
you might want to measure it in

00:14:48.357 --> 00:14:51.080
thousands or five hundreds or
whatever unit they sell them in.

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:53.840
It's a natural unit.
When you want to find

00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:56.610
intergalactic distances,
you may use a light year.

00:14:56.610 --> 00:14:59.990
You use units so that in that
unit, the quantity of interest

00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:03.200
to us is some number that you
can count in your hands.

00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:07.161
When you count people's height,
you use feet because it's

00:15:07.161 --> 00:15:09.919
something between 1 and 8,
let's say.

00:15:09.919 --> 00:15:12.783
You don't want to use angstroms
and you don't want to use

00:15:12.783 --> 00:15:14.753
millimeters.
Likewise, when you want to

00:15:14.753 --> 00:15:17.067
simply count numbers,
it turns out there's a very

00:15:17.067 --> 00:15:19.140
natural number called Avogadro's
Number,

00:15:24.519 --> 00:15:28.300
and Avogadro's Number is 6
times 10^(23).

00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:30.474
There's no unit.
It's simply a number,

00:15:30.474 --> 00:15:34.889
and that's called a mole.
So, a mole is like a dozen.

00:15:34.889 --> 00:15:38.877
We wanted to buy 6 times
10^(23) eggs,

00:15:38.877 --> 00:15:43.080
you will say get me one mole of
eggs.

00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:46.029
A mole is just a number.
It's a huge number.

00:15:46.029 --> 00:15:49.490
You can ask yourself what's so
great about this number?

00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:51.690
Why would someone think of this
particular number?

00:15:51.690 --> 00:15:55.950
Why not some other number?
Why not 10^(24)?

00:15:55.950 --> 00:16:00.310
Do you know what's special
about this number?

00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:04.071
Yes?
Student: [inaudible]

00:16:04.071 --> 00:16:07.809
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Yes.

00:16:07.809 --> 00:16:11.962
If you like,
a mole is such that one mole of

00:16:11.962 --> 00:16:16.265
hydrogen weighs one gram.
And hydrogen is the simplest

00:16:16.265 --> 00:16:20.020
element with a nucleus of just a
proton and the electron's mass

00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:22.830
is negligible.
So, this, if you like,

00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:26.309
is the reciprocal of the mass
of hydrogen.

00:16:26.309 --> 00:16:32.457
In other words,
one over Avogadro's Number is

00:16:32.457 --> 00:16:40.980
the mass of hydrogen in grams,
of a hydrogen atom in grams.

00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:43.623
So, you basically say,
I want to count this large

00:16:43.623 --> 00:16:46.762
number so let me take one gram,
which is my normal unit if

00:16:46.762 --> 00:16:49.972
you're thinking in grams.
Then I ask, "How many hydrogen

00:16:49.972 --> 00:16:52.230
atoms does one gram of hydrogen
contain?"

00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:54.149
That's the number.
That's the mole.

00:16:54.149 --> 00:16:58.402
So, if you decide to measure
the number of atoms you have in

00:16:58.402 --> 00:17:01.103
a given problem,
in terms of this number,

00:17:01.103 --> 00:17:04.259
you write it as some other
small number called moles,

00:17:04.259 --> 00:17:09.318
times the number in a mole,
and you are free to write it

00:17:09.318 --> 00:17:13.268
this way.
If you write it this way,

00:17:13.268 --> 00:17:20.319
then you write this nRT,
R is the universal gas

00:17:20.319 --> 00:17:23.029
constant.
What's n times the

00:17:23.029 --> 00:17:25.203
Boltzmann Constant.
N_0 times the

00:17:25.203 --> 00:17:29.642
Boltzmann Constant.
That happens to be 8.3 joules

00:17:29.642 --> 00:17:34.340
per degree centigrade or per
Kelvin.

00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:40.074
Right?
The units for R will be

00:17:40.074 --> 00:17:42.440
PV, which is units of
energy divided by T.

00:17:45.569 --> 00:17:47.928
In terms of calories,
I'd remember this as a nice,

00:17:47.928 --> 00:17:50.930
round number.
Two calories per degree

00:17:50.930 --> 00:17:55.053
centigrade.
Degrees centigrade and Kelvin

00:17:55.053 --> 00:17:57.810
are the same.
The origins are shifted,

00:17:57.810 --> 00:18:00.939
but when you go up by one
degree in centigrade or Kelvin,

00:18:00.939 --> 00:18:03.230
you go the same amount in
temperature.

00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:06.716
So, this [R]
is what they found out first,

00:18:06.716 --> 00:18:10.930
because they didn't know
anything about atoms and so on.

00:18:10.930 --> 00:18:15.166
But later on when you go look
under the hood of what the gas

00:18:15.166 --> 00:18:19.402
is made of, if you write it in
terms of the number of actual

00:18:19.402 --> 00:18:21.224
atoms,
you should use the little

00:18:21.224 --> 00:18:23.830
k, or you can write it in
terms of number of moles,

00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:25.160
in which case use big R.

00:18:30.109 --> 00:18:34.019
And the relation between the
two is simply this.

00:18:34.019 --> 00:18:37.089
If you're thinking of a gas and
how many moles of gas do I have?

00:18:37.089 --> 00:18:39.573
For example,
one gram of hydrogen would be

00:18:39.573 --> 00:18:41.619
one mole.
Then you will use R.

00:18:41.619 --> 00:18:43.649
If you've gone right down to
fundamentals and say,

00:18:43.649 --> 00:18:45.733
"How many atoms do I have?"
and you put that here,

00:18:45.733 --> 00:18:47.620
you will multiply it by this
very tiny number.

00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:55.061
Alright.
Now, you start with this law

00:18:55.061 --> 00:18:57.789
and you ask the following
question.

00:18:57.789 --> 00:19:01.689
On the left-hand side is the
quantity P times

00:19:01.689 --> 00:19:04.530
V.
On the right-hand side I have

00:19:04.530 --> 00:19:08.049
nRT, but let me write it
now as NkT.

00:19:08.049 --> 00:19:11.911
You guys should be able to go
back and forth between writing

00:19:11.911 --> 00:19:15.380
in terms of number of moles or
the number of atoms.

00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:19.359
You'll like this because all
numbers here will be small,

00:19:19.359 --> 00:19:22.096
of the order 1.
R is a number like 8,

00:19:22.096 --> 00:19:24.355
in some units,
and n would be 1 or 2

00:19:24.355 --> 00:19:26.730
moles.
Here, this N will be a

00:19:26.730 --> 00:19:30.563
huge number, like 10^(23).
k will be a tiny number

00:19:30.563 --> 00:19:32.590
like 10^(-23).
Think in terms of atoms.

00:19:32.590 --> 00:19:35.319
That's what you do.
Big numbers, small constants.

00:19:35.319 --> 00:19:39.710
When you think of moles,
moderate numbers and moderate

00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:43.539
value of constants.
We want to ask ourselves,

00:19:43.539 --> 00:19:47.720
"Is there a microscopic basis
for this equation?"

00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:50.980
In other words,
once we believe in atoms,

00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:55.789
do we understand why there is a
pressure at all in a gas?

00:19:55.789 --> 00:19:57.390
That's what we're going to
think about now.

00:19:57.390 --> 00:20:02.010
So, for this purpose,
we will take a cube of gas.

00:20:06.810 --> 00:20:07.590
Here it is.

00:20:13.509 --> 00:20:15.730
This is a cube of side L
by L by L.

00:20:20.009 --> 00:20:22.996
Inside this is gas and it's got
some pressure,

00:20:22.996 --> 00:20:26.579
and I want to know what's the
value of the pressure.

00:20:26.579 --> 00:20:28.279
You've got to ask yourself,
why is there pressure?

00:20:28.279 --> 00:20:30.079
Remember, I told you what
pressure means.

00:20:30.079 --> 00:20:33.461
If you take this face of the
cube, for example,

00:20:33.461 --> 00:20:36.990
it's got to be nailed down to
the other faces;

00:20:36.990 --> 00:20:39.159
otherwise, it'll just come
flying out because the gas is

00:20:39.159 --> 00:20:41.651
pushing you out.
The pressure is the force on

00:20:41.651 --> 00:20:45.124
this face divided by area.
So, somebody inside is trying

00:20:45.124 --> 00:20:47.977
to get out.
Those guys are the molecules or

00:20:47.977 --> 00:20:52.026
the atoms, and what they're
doing is constantly bouncing off

00:20:52.026 --> 00:20:55.207
the wall,
and every time this one bounces

00:20:55.207 --> 00:20:59.770
on a wall, its momentum changes
from that to the other one.

00:20:59.770 --> 00:21:03.559
So, who's changing the momentum?
Well, the wall is changing the

00:21:03.559 --> 00:21:04.900
momentum.
It's reversing it.

00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:06.721
For example,
if you bounce head-on and go

00:21:06.721 --> 00:21:10.078
back, your momentum is reversed.
That means you push the wall

00:21:10.078 --> 00:21:13.437
with some force and the wall
pushes you back with the

00:21:13.437 --> 00:21:15.826
opposite force.
It's the force that you exert

00:21:15.826 --> 00:21:17.349
on the wall that I'm interested
in.

00:21:17.349 --> 00:21:21.869
I want to find the force on the
wall, say, this particular face.

00:21:21.869 --> 00:21:23.609
You can find the pressure on
any face.

00:21:23.609 --> 00:21:25.039
It's going to be the same
answer.

00:21:25.039 --> 00:21:28.150
I'm going to take the shaded
face to find the pressure on it.

00:21:28.150 --> 00:21:32.783
Now, if you want to ask,
what is the force exerted by me

00:21:32.783 --> 00:21:37.164
on any body, I know the force
has a rate of change of

00:21:37.164 --> 00:21:40.675
momentum,
because that is d/dt of

00:21:40.675 --> 00:21:44.941
mv, and m is a
constant, and that's just

00:21:44.941 --> 00:21:47.250
dv/dt,
which is ma.

00:21:47.250 --> 00:21:50.583
I'm just using old F =
ma, but I'm writing it as a

00:21:50.583 --> 00:21:54.803
rate of change and momentum.
Now, I have N molecules

00:21:54.803 --> 00:21:58.940
or N atoms,
randomly moving inside the box.

00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:02.440
Each in its own direction,
suffering collisions with the

00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:05.877
box, bouncing off like a
billiard ball would at the end

00:22:05.877 --> 00:22:09.759
of the pool table and going to
another wall and doing it.

00:22:09.759 --> 00:22:12.340
Now, that's a very complicated
problem, so we're going to

00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:15.182
simplify the problem.
The simplification is going to

00:22:15.182 --> 00:22:18.806
be, we are going to assume that
one-third of the molecules are

00:22:18.806 --> 00:22:22.010
moving from left to right.
One-third are moving up and

00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:25.299
down and one-third are moving in
and out of the blackboard.

00:22:25.299 --> 00:22:28.765
If at all you make an
assumption that the molecules

00:22:28.765 --> 00:22:32.369
are simply moving in the three
primary directions,

00:22:32.369 --> 00:22:34.530
of course you will have to give
equal numbers in these

00:22:34.530 --> 00:22:36.626
directions.
Nothing in the gas that favors

00:22:36.626 --> 00:22:38.929
horizontal or vertical.
In reality, of course,

00:22:38.929 --> 00:22:41.362
you must admit the fact they
move in all directions,

00:22:41.362 --> 00:22:44.129
but the simplified derivation
happens to give all the right

00:22:44.129 --> 00:22:46.460
physics,
so I'm going to use that.

00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:49.470
So, N over three
molecules are going back and

00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:51.890
forth between this wall,
and this wall.

00:22:51.890 --> 00:22:55.250
I'm showing you a side view.
The wall itself looks like this.

00:22:55.250 --> 00:22:57.460
The molecules go back and forth.

00:23:00.850 --> 00:23:04.902
Next assumption.
All the molecules have the same

00:23:04.902 --> 00:23:07.789
speed, which I'm going to call
v.

00:23:07.789 --> 00:23:12.105
That also is a gross and crude
description of the problem,

00:23:12.105 --> 00:23:16.269
but I'm going to do that anyway
and see what happens.

00:23:16.269 --> 00:23:19.670
So now, you ask yourself the
following question.

00:23:19.670 --> 00:23:24.093
Take one particular molecule.
When it hits the wall and it

00:23:24.093 --> 00:23:28.019
bounces back,
its momentum changes from

00:23:28.019 --> 00:23:31.930
mv to -mv;
therefore, the change in

00:23:31.930 --> 00:23:33.050
momentum is 2mv.

00:23:38.759 --> 00:23:42.329
How often does that change take
place?

00:23:42.329 --> 00:23:45.930
You guys should think about
that first.

00:23:45.930 --> 00:23:48.480
How often will that collision
take place?

00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:51.781
Once you hit the wall here,
you've got to go to the other

00:23:51.781 --> 00:23:54.770
wall and come back.
So, you've got to go a distance

00:23:54.770 --> 00:23:57.423
2L, and you're going at a
speed v,

00:23:57.423 --> 00:24:00.359
the time it takes you is
2L over v.

00:24:00.359 --> 00:24:04.243
So, ΔP over ΔT
is 2L divided by

00:24:04.243 --> 00:24:07.164
v.
That gives me mv^(2)

00:24:07.164 --> 00:24:10.845
over L.
That is the force due to one

00:24:10.845 --> 00:24:14.410
molecule.
That's the average force.

00:24:14.410 --> 00:24:17.759
You realize it's not a
continuous force.

00:24:17.759 --> 00:24:20.588
The molecule will hit the wall,
there's a little force exchange

00:24:20.588 --> 00:24:22.617
between the two,
then there's nothing,

00:24:22.617 --> 00:24:26.009
then you wait until it comes
back and hits the wall again.

00:24:26.009 --> 00:24:29.387
If that were the only thing
going on, what you would find is

00:24:29.387 --> 00:24:32.214
the wall most of the time,
has no pressure and suddenly it

00:24:32.214 --> 00:24:34.150
has a lot of pressure and then
suddenly nothing.

00:24:34.150 --> 00:24:37.089
But fortunately,
this is not the only molecule.

00:24:37.089 --> 00:24:40.848
There are roughly 10^(23) guys
pounding themselves against the

00:24:40.848 --> 00:24:42.603
wall.
So, at any given instant,

00:24:42.603 --> 00:24:45.622
even if it's 10^(-5) seconds,
there'd be a large number of

00:24:45.622 --> 00:24:48.728
molecules colliding.
So, that's why the force will

00:24:48.728 --> 00:24:51.789
appear to be steady rather than
a sharp noise.

00:24:51.789 --> 00:24:54.156
It looked very steady because
somebody or other will be

00:24:54.156 --> 00:24:55.340
pushing against the wall.

00:24:59.369 --> 00:25:01.539
This is the force due to one
molecule.

00:25:01.539 --> 00:25:05.982
The force due to all of them
would be N over 3 times

00:25:05.982 --> 00:25:08.280
mv^(2) over L.

00:25:15.470 --> 00:25:17.354
N over 3 because of the
N molecules,

00:25:17.354 --> 00:25:19.200
a third of them were moving in
this direction.

00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:23.005
You realize the other two
directions are parallel to the

00:25:23.005 --> 00:25:25.288
wall.
They don't apply force on the

00:25:25.288 --> 00:25:26.930
wall.
To apply force on the wall,

00:25:26.930 --> 00:25:29.329
you've got to be moving
perpendicular to the wall.

00:25:29.329 --> 00:25:31.343
For example,
if the planes that walls are

00:25:31.343 --> 00:25:34.012
coming out of the blackboard,
moving in and out of the

00:25:34.012 --> 00:25:36.630
blackboard doesn't produce a
force on this wall.

00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:39.490
That produces a force on the
other two faces.

00:25:39.490 --> 00:25:42.422
So, as far as any one set of
faces is concerned,

00:25:42.422 --> 00:25:45.043
in one plane,
only the motion orthogonal to

00:25:45.043 --> 00:25:48.276
that is going to contribute.
That's why you have N

00:25:48.276 --> 00:25:50.020
over 3.
We're almost done.

00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:52.776
That's the average force.
If you want,

00:25:52.776 --> 00:25:55.200
I can denote average by some
F bar.

00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:58.039
Then what about the average
pressure?

00:25:58.039 --> 00:26:01.359
The average pressure is the
average force divided by the

00:26:01.359 --> 00:26:03.773
area of that face,
which is F over

00:26:03.773 --> 00:26:06.561
L^(2),
that gives me N over 3,

00:26:06.561 --> 00:26:08.500
mv^(2) over
L^(3).

00:26:13.019 --> 00:26:18.108
Now, this is very nice because
L^(3) is just the volume

00:26:18.108 --> 00:26:19.110
of my box.

00:26:23.769 --> 00:26:26.182
So, I take the L^(3),
which is equal to the volume of

00:26:26.182 --> 00:26:29.527
my box,
and I send it to the other side

00:26:29.527 --> 00:26:35.580
and write it as PV equals
N over 3mv^(2).

00:26:44.299 --> 00:26:46.809
This is what the microscopic
theory tells you.

00:26:46.809 --> 00:26:49.904
Microscopic theory says,
if your molecules all have a

00:26:49.904 --> 00:26:52.225
single speed,
they're moving randomly in

00:26:52.225 --> 00:26:55.438
space so that a third of them
are moving back and forth

00:26:55.438 --> 00:26:59.112
against that wall and this wall,
then this is the product

00:26:59.112 --> 00:27:00.938
PV.
Experimentally,

00:27:00.938 --> 00:27:03.529
you find PV =
NkT.

00:27:03.529 --> 00:27:10.137
So, you compare the two
expressions and out comes one of

00:27:10.137 --> 00:27:16.625
the most beautiful results,
which is that mv^(2)

00:27:16.625 --> 00:27:23.100
over 2 is 3 over 2kT.
Now that guy deserves a box.

00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:26.990
Look what it's telling you.
It's a really profound formula.

00:27:26.990 --> 00:27:33.014
It tells you for the first time
a real microscopic meaning of

00:27:33.014 --> 00:27:36.239
temperature.
What you and I call the

00:27:36.239 --> 00:27:40.194
temperature for gas is simply,
up to these factors,

00:27:40.194 --> 00:27:43.437
3/2 k,
simply the kinetic energy of

00:27:43.437 --> 00:27:46.539
the molecules.
That's what temperature is.

00:27:46.539 --> 00:27:49.020
If you've got a gas and you put
your hand into the furnace and

00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:50.496
it feels hot,
the temperature you're

00:27:50.496 --> 00:27:52.820
measuring is directly the
kinetic energy of the molecules.

00:27:57.640 --> 00:28:01.819
That is a great insight into
what temperature means.

00:28:01.819 --> 00:28:06.147
Remember, this is not true if
T is measured in

00:28:06.147 --> 00:28:08.609
centigrade.
If T were measured in

00:28:08.609 --> 00:28:11.221
centigrade, our freezing point
of water mv^(2),

00:28:11.221 --> 00:28:14.509
would vanish.
But that's not what's implied.

00:28:14.509 --> 00:28:16.470
T should be measured
from absolute zero.

00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:19.970
It also tells you why absolute
zero is absolute.

00:28:19.970 --> 00:28:22.597
As you cool your gas,
the kinetic energy of molecules

00:28:22.597 --> 00:28:24.821
are decreasing and decreasing
and decreasing,

00:28:24.821 --> 00:28:26.893
but you cannot go below not
moving at all,

00:28:26.893 --> 00:28:28.936
right?
That's the lowest possible

00:28:28.936 --> 00:28:31.549
kinetic energy.
That's why it's absolute zero.

00:28:31.549 --> 00:28:33.670
At that point,
everybody stops moving.

00:28:33.670 --> 00:28:37.417
That's why you have no pressure.
Now, these results are modified

00:28:37.417 --> 00:28:41.156
by the laws of quantum
mechanics, but we don't have to

00:28:41.156 --> 00:28:44.380
worry about that now.
In the classical physics,

00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:47.932
it's actually correct to say
that when the temperature goes

00:28:47.932 --> 00:28:52.274
to zero, all motion ceases.
Now, this is the picture I want

00:28:52.274 --> 00:28:55.990
you to bear in mind when you say
temperature.

00:28:55.990 --> 00:28:59.619
Absolute temperature is a
measure of molecular agitation.

00:28:59.619 --> 00:29:02.397
More precisely,
up to the constant k,

00:29:02.397 --> 00:29:04.722
3/2 k,
the kinetic energy of a

00:29:04.722 --> 00:29:07.370
molecule is the absolute
temperature.

00:29:07.370 --> 00:29:09.955
That's for a gas.
If you took a solid and you

00:29:09.955 --> 00:29:12.180
say, what happens when I heat
the solid?

00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:15.250
You have a question?
Yes?

00:29:15.250 --> 00:29:19.277
Student: [inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:29:19.277 --> 00:29:23.961
Shankar: You divide by 2
because ½ mv^(2) is a

00:29:23.961 --> 00:29:27.320
familiar quantity,
namely, kinetic energy.

00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:31.414
That's why you divide by 2.
Another thing to notice is that

00:29:31.414 --> 00:29:35.889
every gas, whatever it's made
of, at a given temperature has a

00:29:35.889 --> 00:29:40.437
given kinetic energy because the
kinetic energy per molecule on

00:29:40.437 --> 00:29:44.692
the left-hand side is dependent
on absolute temperature and

00:29:44.692 --> 00:29:47.481
nothing else.
So at certain degrees,

00:29:47.481 --> 00:29:50.185
like 300 Kelvin,
hydrogen kinetic energy would

00:29:50.185 --> 00:29:53.849
be the same, carbon kinetic
energy would also be the same.

00:29:53.849 --> 00:29:56.670
The kinetic energy will be the
same, not the velocity.

00:29:56.670 --> 00:30:00.607
So, the carbon atom is heavier,
it will be moving slower at

00:30:00.607 --> 00:30:04.680
that temperature in order to
have the same kinetic energy.

00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:07.430
So, all molecules,
all gases, have a given

00:30:07.430 --> 00:30:09.567
temperature.
All atoms, let me say,

00:30:09.567 --> 00:30:12.614
at a given temperature in
gaseous form will have the same

00:30:12.614 --> 00:30:16.122
kinetic energy [per molecule].
Now, if you have a

00:30:16.122 --> 00:30:21.450
solid--What's the difference
between a gas and a solid?

00:30:21.450 --> 00:30:25.130
In a gas, the atoms are moving
anywhere they want in the box.

00:30:25.130 --> 00:30:28.880
In a solid, every atom has a
place.

00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:32.030
If you take a two-dimensional
solid, the atoms look like this.

00:30:36.630 --> 00:30:40.711
They form a lattice or an array.
That's because you will find

00:30:40.711 --> 00:30:43.452
out that, this is more advanced
stuff, that every atom finds

00:30:43.452 --> 00:30:45.590
itself in a potential that looks
like this.

00:30:49.349 --> 00:30:52.870
Imagine on the ground you make
these hollows.

00:30:52.870 --> 00:30:55.529
Low points -- low potential;
high points -- high potential.

00:30:55.529 --> 00:30:59.435
Obviously, if you put a bunch
of objects here they will sit at

00:30:59.435 --> 00:31:03.085
the bottom of these little
concave holes you've dug in the

00:31:03.085 --> 00:31:05.883
ground.
At zero degrees absolute all

00:31:05.883 --> 00:31:10.220
atoms will sit at the bottom of
their allotted positions;

00:31:10.220 --> 00:31:12.279
that'll be a solid at zero
temperature.

00:31:12.279 --> 00:31:16.619
So in a solid,
everybody has a location.

00:31:16.619 --> 00:31:18.619
I've shown you a
one-dimensional solid,

00:31:18.619 --> 00:31:21.409
but you can imagine a
three-dimensional solid where in

00:31:21.409 --> 00:31:23.619
a lattice of three-dimensional
points,

00:31:23.619 --> 00:31:27.430
there's an assigned place for
each atom and it sits there.

00:31:27.430 --> 00:31:31.614
If you heat up that solid now,
what happens is these guys

00:31:31.614 --> 00:31:34.342
start vibrating.
Now, here is where your

00:31:34.342 --> 00:31:37.829
knowledge of simple harmonic
motions will come into play.

00:31:37.829 --> 00:31:41.126
When you take a system in
equilibrium, it will execute

00:31:41.126 --> 00:31:44.359
simple harmonic motion if you
give it a real kick.

00:31:44.359 --> 00:31:47.437
If you put it on top of a
hotplate, the atoms in the hot

00:31:47.437 --> 00:31:50.570
plate will bump into these guys
and start them moving.

00:31:50.570 --> 00:31:54.227
They will start vibrating.
So, a hot solid is one in which

00:31:54.227 --> 00:31:59.102
the atoms are making more and
more violent oscillations around

00:31:59.102 --> 00:32:03.213
their assigned positions.
If you heat them more and more

00:32:03.213 --> 00:32:05.900
and more, eventually you start
doing this.

00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:07.420
You go all the way from here to
here;

00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:10.235
there is nothing to prevent it
from rolling over to the next

00:32:10.235 --> 00:32:12.320
side.
Once you jump the fence,

00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:15.530
you know, think of a bunch of
houses, okay?

00:32:15.530 --> 00:32:18.649
Or a hole in the ground.
You're living in a hole in the

00:32:18.649 --> 00:32:21.123
ground, as you get agitated
you're able to do more and more

00:32:21.123 --> 00:32:23.470
oscillations so you can roll
over to the next house.

00:32:23.470 --> 00:32:26.485
Once that happens all hell
breaks loose because you don't

00:32:26.485 --> 00:32:28.640
have any reason to stay where
you are.

00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:32.030
You start going everywhere.
What do you think that is?

00:32:32.030 --> 00:32:33.833
Student: Melting.
Professor Ramamurti

00:32:33.833 --> 00:32:35.339
Shankar: Pardon me?
Student: Melting.

00:32:35.339 --> 00:32:36.259
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: That's melting.

00:32:36.259 --> 00:32:38.119
That's the definition of
melting.

00:32:38.119 --> 00:32:40.868
Melting is when you can leap
over this potential barrier,

00:32:40.868 --> 00:32:43.420
potential energy barrier,
and go to the next site.

00:32:43.420 --> 00:32:45.410
The next side is just like this
side.

00:32:45.410 --> 00:32:47.160
If you can jump that fence,
you can jump this one.

00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:50.692
You go everywhere and you melt.
That's the process of melting,

00:32:50.692 --> 00:32:53.325
and once you have a liquid,
atoms don't have a definite

00:32:53.325 --> 00:32:55.514
location.
Now, between a liquid and a

00:32:55.514 --> 00:32:58.843
solid, there is this clear
difference, but a liquid and a

00:32:58.843 --> 00:33:01.178
vapor is more subtle.
So, I don't want to go into

00:33:01.178 --> 00:33:02.884
that.
If you look at a liquid

00:33:02.884 --> 00:33:06.874
locally, it will look very much
like a solid in the sense that

00:33:06.874 --> 00:33:10.930
inter-atomic spacing is very
tightly constrained in liquid.

00:33:10.930 --> 00:33:13.316
Whereas in a solid,
if I know I am here,

00:33:13.316 --> 00:33:16.376
I know if I go 100 times the
basic lattice spacing,

00:33:16.376 --> 00:33:19.130
there'll be another person
sitting there.

00:33:19.130 --> 00:33:22.710
That's called long-range order.
In a liquid, I cannot say that.

00:33:22.710 --> 00:33:24.329
In a liquid,
I can say I am here.

00:33:24.329 --> 00:33:27.663
Locally, the environment around
me is known, but if you go a few

00:33:27.663 --> 00:33:30.266
hundred miles,
I cannot tell you a precise

00:33:30.266 --> 00:33:33.519
location if some other atom will
be there or not.

00:33:33.519 --> 00:33:36.409
So, we say liquid is
short-range positional order,

00:33:36.409 --> 00:33:39.829
but not long-range order,
and a gas has no order at all.

00:33:39.829 --> 00:33:41.668
If I tell you there's a gas
molecule here,

00:33:41.668 --> 00:33:44.403
I cannot tell you where anybody
else is because nobody has any

00:33:44.403 --> 00:33:47.789
assigned location.
Okay.

00:33:47.789 --> 00:33:50.860
So, this is the picture you
should have of temperature.

00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:54.464
Temperature is agitated motion.
Either motion in the vicinity

00:33:54.464 --> 00:33:57.918
of where you are told to sit.
If you're in a solid a motion

00:33:57.918 --> 00:34:01.339
all over the box with more and
more kinetic energy.

00:34:01.339 --> 00:34:04.395
The next thing in this
caricature is that it is

00:34:04.395 --> 00:34:08.580
certainly not true that a third
of the molecules are moving back

00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:10.809
and forth.
We know that's a joke, right?

00:34:10.809 --> 00:34:13.395
Now, in this room there's no
reason on earth a third of the

00:34:13.395 --> 00:34:15.580
molecules are doing this than
others are doing.

00:34:15.580 --> 00:34:17.340
That's not approximation.
They're moving in random

00:34:17.340 --> 00:34:18.984
directions.
So, if you really got the

00:34:18.984 --> 00:34:20.816
stomach for it,
you should do a pressure

00:34:20.816 --> 00:34:23.353
calculation in which you assume
the molecules of random

00:34:23.353 --> 00:34:25.420
velocities sprinkled in all
directions,

00:34:25.420 --> 00:34:28.571
and after all the hard work,
turns out you get exactly this

00:34:28.571 --> 00:34:30.418
answer.
So, that's one thing I didn't

00:34:30.418 --> 00:34:32.930
want to do.
But something I should point

00:34:32.930 --> 00:34:37.127
out to you is the following.
So, suppose I give you a gas at

00:34:37.127 --> 00:34:39.434
300 Kelvin.
You go and you take this

00:34:39.434 --> 00:34:42.792
formula literally and you
calculate from it a certain ½

00:34:42.792 --> 00:34:44.965
mv^(2).
If you knew the mass of the

00:34:44.965 --> 00:34:47.320
atom, say, it's hydrogen,
we know the mass of hydrogen.

00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:50.044
Then, you find the velocity and
you say okay,

00:34:50.044 --> 00:34:53.387
this man tells me that anytime
I catch a hydrogen atom,

00:34:53.387 --> 00:34:56.050
it'll have this velocity at 300
Kelvin.

00:34:56.050 --> 00:34:58.573
It may have random direction,
but he tells me that's the

00:34:58.573 --> 00:35:00.675
velocity square.
Take the square root of that,

00:35:00.675 --> 00:35:03.313
that's the velocity.
It seems to us saying the

00:35:03.313 --> 00:35:05.850
unique velocity to each
temperature.

00:35:05.850 --> 00:35:08.943
Well, that's not correct.
Not only are the molecules

00:35:08.943 --> 00:35:12.610
moving in random directions,
they're also moving with

00:35:12.610 --> 00:35:15.360
essentially all possible
velocities.

00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:18.869
In fact, there are many,
many possible velocities and

00:35:18.869 --> 00:35:21.931
this velocity I'm getting,
in this formula,

00:35:21.931 --> 00:35:25.737
is some kind of average
velocity, or the most popular

00:35:25.737 --> 00:35:27.800
one,
or the most common one.

00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:32.312
So, if you really go to a gas
and you have the ability to look

00:35:32.312 --> 00:35:36.454
into it and see for each
velocity, what's the probability

00:35:36.454 --> 00:35:40.405
that I get that velocity?
The picture I've given you is

00:35:40.405 --> 00:35:44.015
the probability of zero except
at this one magical velocity

00:35:44.015 --> 00:35:47.354
controlled by the temperature.
But the real graph looks like

00:35:47.354 --> 00:35:47.620
this.

00:35:50.890 --> 00:35:53.629
It has a certain peak.
It likes to have a certain

00:35:53.629 --> 00:35:55.404
value.
If you know enough about

00:35:55.404 --> 00:35:58.287
statistics, you know there's a
most probable value,

00:35:58.287 --> 00:36:00.710
there's a median,
there's a mean value.

00:36:00.710 --> 00:36:03.862
There are different definitions.
They will all vary by factors

00:36:03.862 --> 00:36:07.131
of order 1, but the average
kinetic energy will obey this

00:36:07.131 --> 00:36:08.650
condition.
Yes?

00:36:08.650 --> 00:36:10.955
Student: [inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:36:10.955 --> 00:36:13.873
Shankar: It's not really a
Gaussian because if you draw the

00:36:13.873 --> 00:36:18.913
nature of this curve,
it looks like v^(2)e to

00:36:18.913 --> 00:36:23.550
the -mv^(2) over
2kT.

00:36:23.550 --> 00:36:25.389
That's the graph I'm trying to
draw here.

00:36:25.389 --> 00:36:27.869
So, it looks like a Gaussian in
the vicinity of this,

00:36:27.869 --> 00:36:30.440
but it's kind of skewed.
It's forced to vanish at the

00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:30.820
origin.

00:36:34.150 --> 00:36:36.679
And it's not peaked at v
= 0.

00:36:36.679 --> 00:36:39.970
A real Gaussian peak at this
point would be symmetric.

00:36:39.970 --> 00:36:42.315
It's not symmetric;
it vanishes here and it

00:36:42.315 --> 00:36:45.407
vanishes infinity.
So, this is called a

00:36:45.407 --> 00:36:49.891
Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution.
You don't have to remember any

00:36:49.891 --> 00:36:53.454
names but that is the detailed
property of what's happening in

00:36:53.454 --> 00:36:56.674
a gas.
So, a temperature does not pick

00:36:56.674 --> 00:37:00.500
a unique velocity,
but it picks this graph.

00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:03.460
If you vary your temperature,
look at what you have to do.

00:37:03.460 --> 00:37:06.150
If you change the number
T here,

00:37:06.150 --> 00:37:08.840
if you double the value of
T,

00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:11.637
that means if you double the
value of v^(2) here and

00:37:11.637 --> 00:37:13.469
there, the graph will look the
same.

00:37:13.469 --> 00:37:15.929
So, at every temperature there
is a certain shape.

00:37:15.929 --> 00:37:19.433
If you go to your temperature,
it will look more or less the

00:37:19.433 --> 00:37:23.115
same, but it may be peaked at a
different velocity if you go to

00:37:23.115 --> 00:37:26.669
a higher temperature.
Now, this is another thing I

00:37:26.669 --> 00:37:30.805
want to tell you.
If you took a box containing

00:37:30.805 --> 00:37:35.214
not atoms but just radiation,
in other words,

00:37:35.214 --> 00:37:39.377
go inside a pizza oven.
Take out all the air,

00:37:39.377 --> 00:37:43.457
but the oven is still hot,
and the walls of the oven are

00:37:43.457 --> 00:37:46.349
radiating electromagnetic
radiation.

00:37:46.349 --> 00:37:50.261
Electromagnetic radiation comes
in different frequencies,

00:37:50.261 --> 00:37:54.522
and you can ask how much energy
is contained in every possible

00:37:54.522 --> 00:37:57.468
frequency range.
You know, each frequency is a

00:37:57.468 --> 00:37:59.867
color so you know that.
So, how much energy is in the

00:37:59.867 --> 00:38:03.110
red and how much is in the blue?
That graph also looks like this.

00:38:03.110 --> 00:38:06.750
That's a more complicated law
called the Planck distribution.

00:38:06.750 --> 00:38:10.498
That law also has a shape
completely determined by

00:38:10.498 --> 00:38:12.960
temperature.
Whereas for atoms,

00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:17.364
the shape is determined by
temperature as well as the mass

00:38:17.364 --> 00:38:20.030
of the molecules.
In the case of radiation,

00:38:20.030 --> 00:38:22.496
it's determined fully by
temperature and the velocity of

00:38:22.496 --> 00:38:24.241
light.
You give me a temperature,

00:38:24.241 --> 00:38:27.284
and I will draw you another one
of these roughly bell-shaped

00:38:27.284 --> 00:38:29.360
curves.
As you heat up the furnace,

00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:30.690
the shape will change.

00:38:34.190 --> 00:38:37.781
So again, a temperature for
radiation means a particular

00:38:37.781 --> 00:38:40.719
distribution of energies at each
frequency.

00:38:40.719 --> 00:38:43.180
For a gas it means a
distribution of velocities.

00:38:48.889 --> 00:38:51.320
Has anybody seen that in the
news lately, you know,

00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:53.958
or heard about this?
Student: [inaudible]

00:38:53.958 --> 00:38:56.690
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Pardon me?

00:38:56.690 --> 00:38:58.585
Student: [inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:38:58.585 --> 00:39:00.789
Shankar: About this
particular graph for radiation.

00:39:00.789 --> 00:39:04.002
The probability at each
frequency of finding radiation

00:39:04.002 --> 00:39:07.700
of the frequency in a furnace of
some temperature T.

00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:11.887
Yes?
Student: [inaudible]

00:39:11.887 --> 00:39:14.866
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: No,

00:39:14.866 --> 00:39:18.283
but in current news.
In the last few years,

00:39:18.283 --> 00:39:20.849
what people did was the
following.

00:39:20.849 --> 00:39:25.296
It's one of the predictions of
the Big Bang theory that the

00:39:25.296 --> 00:39:29.820
universe was formed some 14 and
a half billion years ago,

00:39:29.820 --> 00:39:32.929
and in the earliest stages the
temperature of the universe was

00:39:32.929 --> 00:39:36.069
some incredibly high degrees,
then as it expanded the

00:39:36.069 --> 00:39:39.256
universe cooled,
and today, at the current size,

00:39:39.256 --> 00:39:42.239
it has got a certain average
temperature,

00:39:42.239 --> 00:39:44.329
which is a remnant of the Big
Bang.

00:39:44.329 --> 00:39:49.812
And that temperature means that
we are sitting in furnace of the

00:39:49.812 --> 00:39:52.300
Big Bang.
But the furnace has cooled a

00:39:52.300 --> 00:39:56.671
lot over the billions of years.
The temperature of the universe

00:39:56.671 --> 00:40:01.097
is around 3 degrees Kelvin.
And the way you determine that

00:40:01.097 --> 00:40:03.840
is you point your telescope in
the sky.

00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:06.360
Of course, you're going to get
light from this star;

00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:07.699
you're going to get light from
that star.

00:40:07.699 --> 00:40:11.139
Ignore all the pointy things
and look at the smooth

00:40:11.139 --> 00:40:15.130
background, and it should be the
same in all directions.

00:40:15.130 --> 00:40:18.980
And plot that radiation,
and now they use satellites to

00:40:18.980 --> 00:40:22.831
plot that, and you'll get a
perfect fit to this kind of

00:40:22.831 --> 00:40:26.059
furnace radiation,
called Black Body Radiation.

00:40:26.059 --> 00:40:28.963
And you read the temperature by
taking that graph and fitting it

00:40:28.963 --> 00:40:31.360
to a graph like this,
but there'll be temperature.

00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:33.645
In the case of light,
this won't be velocity squared,

00:40:33.645 --> 00:40:35.360
but it will be the frequency
squared,

00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:38.332
but read off the temperature
that'll make this work and

00:40:38.332 --> 00:40:40.590
that's what gives you 3.1 or
something.

00:40:40.590 --> 00:40:44.287
Near 3 degrees Kelvin.
In fact, the data point for

00:40:44.287 --> 00:40:48.366
that now if you got that in your
lab then you will be definitely

00:40:48.366 --> 00:40:52.056
busted for fudging your data
because it's a perfect fit to

00:40:52.056 --> 00:40:55.475
Black Body Radiation.
One of the most perfect fits to

00:40:55.475 --> 00:40:58.722
Black Body Radiation is the
background radiation of the Big

00:40:58.722 --> 00:41:00.292
Bang.
And it's isotropic,

00:41:00.292 --> 00:41:03.717
meaning it's the same in all
directions, and this is one of

00:41:03.717 --> 00:41:07.320
the predictions of the Big Bang
is that that'll be the remnant

00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:11.056
of the Black Body Radiation.
Again, it tells you there's a

00:41:11.056 --> 00:41:13.583
sense in which,
if you go to intergalactic

00:41:13.583 --> 00:41:17.232
space, that is your temperature.
That's the temperature you get

00:41:17.232 --> 00:41:19.294
for free.
We're all living in that heat

00:41:19.294 --> 00:41:21.366
bath at 3 degrees.
You want more heat,

00:41:21.366 --> 00:41:24.505
you've got to light up your
furnace but this is everywhere

00:41:24.505 --> 00:41:26.708
in the universe,
that heat left over from

00:41:26.708 --> 00:41:29.309
creation.
Okay.

00:41:29.309 --> 00:41:32.260
That's a very,
very interesting subject.

00:41:32.260 --> 00:41:36.847
You know, a lot of new physics
is coming out by looking at just

00:41:36.847 --> 00:41:41.434
the Black Body Radiation because
the radiation that's coming to

00:41:41.434 --> 00:41:44.320
your eye left those stars long
ago.

00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:48.469
So, what you see today is not
what's happening today.

00:41:48.469 --> 00:41:52.080
It's what happened long ago
when the radiation left that

00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:55.244
part of the universe.
Therefore, we can actually tell

00:41:55.244 --> 00:41:58.232
something about the universe not
only now, but at earlier

00:41:58.232 --> 00:42:00.766
periods.
And that's the way in which we

00:42:00.766 --> 00:42:04.465
can actually tell whether the
universe is expanding or not

00:42:04.465 --> 00:42:07.840
expanding or is it accelerating
in its expansion,

00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:10.608
or you can even say once it was
decelerating and now it's

00:42:10.608 --> 00:42:13.255
accelerating.
All that information comes by

00:42:13.255 --> 00:42:16.869
being able to look at the
radiation from the Big Bang.

00:42:16.869 --> 00:42:19.570
But for you guys,
I think the most interesting

00:42:19.570 --> 00:42:22.690
thing is that when you are in
thermal equilibrium,

00:42:22.690 --> 00:42:26.146
and you are living in a certain
temperature, then the radiation

00:42:26.146 --> 00:42:29.380
in your world and the molecules
and atoms in your world,

00:42:29.380 --> 00:42:32.989
will have a distribution of
frequencies and velocities given

00:42:32.989 --> 00:42:35.853
by that universal graph.
Now in our class,

00:42:35.853 --> 00:42:39.972
we will simplify life and
replace this graph with a huge

00:42:39.972 --> 00:42:44.391
peak at a certain velocity by
pretending everybody's at that

00:42:44.391 --> 00:42:47.739
velocity.
We will treat the whole gas as

00:42:47.739 --> 00:42:51.420
if it was represented by single
average number.

00:42:51.420 --> 00:42:54.057
So, when someone says find the
velocity of molecules,

00:42:54.057 --> 00:42:56.340
they're talking about the
average velocity.

00:42:56.340 --> 00:42:59.595
You know statistically that
it's the distribution of answers

00:42:59.595 --> 00:43:03.077
and an average answer.
Because the average is what you

00:43:03.077 --> 00:43:06.352
and I have to know.
Namely, ½ mv^(2) is 3/2

00:43:06.352 --> 00:43:11.039
kT, on average.
Okay.

00:43:11.039 --> 00:43:15.670
Now, I'm going to study in
detail thermodynamics.

00:43:15.670 --> 00:43:19.554
So, the system I'm going to
study is the only one we all

00:43:19.554 --> 00:43:23.440
study, which is an ideal gas
sitting inside a piston.

00:43:27.219 --> 00:43:30.518
It's got a temperature,
it's got a pressure,

00:43:30.518 --> 00:43:34.434
and it's got a volume.
And I'm going to plot here

00:43:34.434 --> 00:43:39.141
pressure and volume and I'm
going to put a dot and that's my

00:43:39.141 --> 00:43:41.642
gas.
The state of my gas is

00:43:41.642 --> 00:43:44.909
summarized by where you put the
dot.

00:43:44.909 --> 00:43:50.762
Every dot here is a possible
state of equilibrium for the

00:43:50.762 --> 00:43:52.791
gas.
Remember, the gas,

00:43:52.791 --> 00:43:56.997
if you look at it under the
hood, is made up of 10^(23)

00:43:56.997 --> 00:44:00.256
molecules.
The real, real state of the gas

00:44:00.256 --> 00:44:04.096
is obtained by saying,
giving me 10^(23) locations and

00:44:04.096 --> 00:44:06.681
10^(23) velocities.
According to Newton,

00:44:06.681 --> 00:44:09.605
that's the maximum information
you can give me about the gas

00:44:09.605 --> 00:44:11.533
right now,
because with that and Newton's

00:44:11.533 --> 00:44:13.702
laws I can predict the future.
But when you study

00:44:13.702 --> 00:44:15.763
thermodynamics,
you don't really want to look

00:44:15.763 --> 00:44:18.132
into the details.
You want to look at gross

00:44:18.132 --> 00:44:21.340
macroscopic properties and there
are two that you need.

00:44:21.340 --> 00:44:23.930
Pressure and volume.
Now, you might say,

00:44:23.930 --> 00:44:28.703
"What about temperature?"
Why don't I have a third axis

00:44:28.703 --> 00:44:32.937
for temperature?
Why is there also not a

00:44:32.937 --> 00:44:34.809
property?
Yes?

00:44:34.809 --> 00:44:36.890
Student: [inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:44:36.890 --> 00:44:42.969
Shankar: Yeah.
Because PV = NkT.

00:44:42.969 --> 00:44:45.744
I don't have to give you
T, if I know P and

00:44:45.744 --> 00:44:47.120
V.
There's not an independent

00:44:47.120 --> 00:44:48.545
thing you can pick.
You can pick P and

00:44:48.545 --> 00:44:50.909
V independently.
You cannot pick T.

00:44:50.909 --> 00:44:53.487
Let me tell you,
by the way, PV = NkT is

00:44:53.487 --> 00:44:57.099
not a universal law.
It's the law that you apply to

00:44:57.099 --> 00:45:01.153
dilute gases.
But we are going to just study

00:45:01.153 --> 00:45:05.141
only dilute ideal gas.
Ideal gas is one in which the

00:45:05.141 --> 00:45:08.724
atoms and molecules are so far
apart that they don't feel any

00:45:08.724 --> 00:45:11.650
forces between each other unless
they collide.

00:45:11.650 --> 00:45:16.059
So, here is my gas.
It's sitting here.

00:45:16.059 --> 00:45:20.100
Now, what I do,
I had a few weights on top of

00:45:20.100 --> 00:45:21.310
it.
Three weights.

00:45:21.310 --> 00:45:24.540
I suddenly pull out one weight.
Throw it out.

00:45:24.540 --> 00:45:29.152
What do you think will happen?
Well, I think this gas will now

00:45:29.152 --> 00:45:32.639
shoot up, it'll bob up and down
a few times.

00:45:32.639 --> 00:45:35.509
Then after a few seconds,
or a fraction of a second,

00:45:35.509 --> 00:45:37.760
it'll settle down with a new
location.

00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:41.454
By "settle down," I mean after
a while I will not see any

00:45:41.454 --> 00:45:45.914
macroscopic motion.
Then the gas has a new pressure

00:45:45.914 --> 00:45:49.909
and a new volume.
It's gone from being there to

00:45:49.909 --> 00:45:50.900
being there.

00:45:54.420 --> 00:45:58.901
What about in between?
What happened in between the

00:45:58.901 --> 00:46:02.640
starting and finishing points?
You might say look,

00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:06.327
if it was here in the beginning
it was there later,

00:46:06.327 --> 00:46:09.960
it must've followed some path.
Not really.

00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:12.668
Not in this process,
because if you do it very

00:46:12.668 --> 00:46:16.219
abruptly, suddenly throwing out
one-third of the weights,

00:46:16.219 --> 00:46:19.106
there's a period when the
piston rushes up,

00:46:19.106 --> 00:46:21.650
when the gas is not in
equilibrium.

00:46:21.650 --> 00:46:24.409
By that, I mean there is no
single pressure you can

00:46:24.409 --> 00:46:27.422
associate with the gas.
The bottom of the gas doesn't

00:46:27.422 --> 00:46:30.519
even know the top is flying off.
It's at the old pressure.

00:46:30.519 --> 00:46:32.510
At the top of the gas there's a
low pressure.

00:46:32.510 --> 00:46:35.440
So, different parts of the gas
at different pressure,

00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:38.034
we don't call that equilibrium.
So, the dot,

00:46:38.034 --> 00:46:40.910
representing this system,
moves off the graph.

00:46:40.910 --> 00:46:43.228
It's off.
It's off the radar,

00:46:43.228 --> 00:46:45.532
and only when it has finally
settled down,

00:46:45.532 --> 00:46:48.961
the entire gas can make up its
mind on what its pressure wants

00:46:48.961 --> 00:46:50.860
to be;
you put it back here.

00:46:50.860 --> 00:46:54.512
So, we have a little problem
that we have these equilibrium

00:46:54.512 --> 00:46:58.354
states, but when you try to go
from one to another you fly off

00:46:58.354 --> 00:47:00.671
the map.
So, you want to find a device

00:47:00.671 --> 00:47:03.847
by which you can stay on the
PV diagram as you change

00:47:03.847 --> 00:47:06.475
the state of the gas,
and that brings us to the

00:47:06.475 --> 00:47:09.039
notion of what you call a
quasi-static process.

00:47:09.039 --> 00:47:12.259
A quasi-static process is
trying to have it both ways in

00:47:12.259 --> 00:47:15.070
which you want to change the
state of the gas,

00:47:15.070 --> 00:47:18.449
and you don't want it to leave
the PV diagram.

00:47:18.449 --> 00:47:22.050
You want it to be always at
equilibrium.

00:47:22.050 --> 00:47:26.488
So, what you really want to do
is not put in three big fat

00:47:26.488 --> 00:47:29.992
blocks like this,
but instead take a gas where

00:47:29.992 --> 00:47:33.030
you have many,
many grains of sand.

00:47:33.030 --> 00:47:38.280
They can produce the pressure.
Now, remove one grain of sand.

00:47:38.280 --> 00:47:40.519
It moves a tiny bit and very
quickly settles down.

00:47:40.519 --> 00:47:43.304
It is again true during the
tiny bit of settling down you

00:47:43.304 --> 00:47:46.286
didn't know what it was doing,
but you certainly nailed it at

00:47:46.286 --> 00:47:49.044
the second location.
You move one grain at a time,

00:47:49.044 --> 00:47:52.172
then you get a picture like
this and you can see where this

00:47:52.172 --> 00:47:54.451
is going.
You can make the grain smaller

00:47:54.451 --> 00:47:57.876
and smaller and smaller and in a
mathematical sense you can then

00:47:57.876 --> 00:48:00.260
form a continuous line.
That is to say,

00:48:00.260 --> 00:48:03.817
you perform a process that
leaves the system arbitrarily

00:48:03.817 --> 00:48:06.902
close to equilibrium,
meaning give it enough time to

00:48:06.902 --> 00:48:10.019
readjust to the new pressure,
settle down to the new volume,

00:48:10.019 --> 00:48:12.369
take another grain and another
grain.

00:48:12.369 --> 00:48:15.581
And in the spirit of calculus,
you can make these changes

00:48:15.581 --> 00:48:18.850
vanishing so that you can really
then say you did this.

00:48:18.850 --> 00:48:21.710
Yes?
Student: Are all of

00:48:21.710 --> 00:48:23.360
these small processes
reversible?

00:48:23.360 --> 00:48:24.030
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Pardon me?

00:48:24.030 --> 00:48:25.173
Student: Are all of
these small processes

00:48:25.173 --> 00:48:25.864
reversible?
Professor Ramamurti

00:48:25.864 --> 00:48:27.519
Shankar: Yes.
Such a process is also

00:48:27.519 --> 00:48:30.588
called--you can call it
quasi-static but one of the

00:48:30.588 --> 00:48:32.920
features of that,
it is reversible.

00:48:32.920 --> 00:48:35.550
You've got to be a little
careful when you say reversible.

00:48:35.550 --> 00:48:38.776
What we mean by "reversible"
is, if I took off a grain of

00:48:38.776 --> 00:48:41.369
sand and it came from here to
the next dot,

00:48:41.369 --> 00:48:45.538
and I put the grain back,
it'll climb back to where it

00:48:45.538 --> 00:48:48.001
was.
So, you can go back and forth

00:48:48.001 --> 00:48:50.342
on this.
But now, that's an idealized

00:48:50.342 --> 00:48:53.541
process because if you had a
friction, if you had any

00:48:53.541 --> 00:48:56.309
friction between the piston and
the walls,

00:48:56.309 --> 00:48:59.385
then if you took out a grain
and it went up,

00:48:59.385 --> 00:49:03.819
you put the grain back it might
not come back to quite where it

00:49:03.819 --> 00:49:06.782
is.
Because some of the frictional

00:49:06.782 --> 00:49:11.468
losses you will never get back.
You cannot put Humpty Dumpty

00:49:11.468 --> 00:49:13.614
back.
So, most of the time processes

00:49:13.614 --> 00:49:16.226
are not reversible,
even if you do them slowly,

00:49:16.226 --> 00:49:19.070
if there is friction.
So, assume it's a completely

00:49:19.070 --> 00:49:21.870
frictionless system.
Because if there is friction,

00:49:21.870 --> 00:49:25.368
there is some heat that goes
out somewhere and some energy is

00:49:25.368 --> 00:49:28.050
lost somewhere and we cannot
bring it back.

00:49:28.050 --> 00:49:31.294
If we took a frictionless
piston and on top of it moved it

00:49:31.294 --> 00:49:33.969
very, very slowly,
you can follow this graph.

00:49:33.969 --> 00:49:36.729
That's the kind of
thermodynamic process we're

00:49:36.729 --> 00:49:38.550
talking about.
In the old days,

00:49:38.550 --> 00:49:41.175
when I studied a single
particular of the xy

00:49:41.175 --> 00:49:44.429
plane, I just said the guy goes
from here to here to there.

00:49:44.429 --> 00:49:46.965
That's very easy to study and
there's no restriction on how

00:49:46.965 --> 00:49:49.579
quickly or how fast it moved.
Particles have trajectories no

00:49:49.579 --> 00:49:52.524
matter how quickly they move.
For a thermodynamic system,

00:49:52.524 --> 00:49:56.204
you cannot move them too fast,
because they are extended and

00:49:56.204 --> 00:50:00.010
you are having a huge gas a
single number called pressure,

00:50:00.010 --> 00:50:03.603
so you cannot change one part
of the gas without waiting for

00:50:03.603 --> 00:50:07.197
all of them to communicate and
readjust and achieve a global

00:50:07.197 --> 00:50:10.730
value for the new pressure and
you can move gradually.

00:50:10.730 --> 00:50:14.414
That's why it takes time to
drag along 10^(23) particles as

00:50:14.414 --> 00:50:18.670
if they are the single number or
two numbers characterizing them.

00:50:18.670 --> 00:50:22.100
So, we'll be studying processes
like this.

00:50:22.100 --> 00:50:25.761
Now, this is called a state.
Two is a state and one is a

00:50:25.761 --> 00:50:28.739
state.
Every dot here, that is a state.

00:50:28.739 --> 00:50:36.266
Now, in every state of the
system, I'm going to define a

00:50:36.266 --> 00:50:41.603
new variable,
which is called a quantity

00:50:41.603 --> 00:50:47.010
called U,
which stands for the internal

00:50:47.010 --> 00:50:48.760
energy of the gas.

00:50:54.210 --> 00:50:57.760
Internal energy is simply the
kinetic energy of the gas

00:50:57.760 --> 00:50:59.723
molecules.
For solids and liquids,

00:50:59.723 --> 00:51:01.559
there's a more complicated
formula.

00:51:01.559 --> 00:51:03.767
For the gas,
internal energy is just the

00:51:03.767 --> 00:51:06.369
kinetic energy.
And what is that?

00:51:06.369 --> 00:51:12.180
It is 3/2 kT per
molecule times N.

00:51:12.180 --> 00:51:19.610
I'm sorry, 3/2 Nk, yeah.
3/2 kT times that.

00:51:19.610 --> 00:51:25.780
Or we can write it as 3/2
nRT.

00:51:29.850 --> 00:51:33.847
But nRT is PV.
You can also write it as 3/2

00:51:33.847 --> 00:51:36.530
PV, so internal energy is
just 3/2 PV.

00:51:36.530 --> 00:51:39.293
That means at a given point on
the PV diagram,

00:51:39.293 --> 00:51:41.260
you have a certain internal
energy.

00:51:41.260 --> 00:51:43.809
If you are there,
that's your internal energy.

00:51:43.809 --> 00:51:46.959
Take there-halves of PV
and that's the energy and that's

00:51:46.959 --> 00:51:50.210
literally the kinetic energy of
all the molecules in your box.

00:51:50.210 --> 00:51:55.049
So, now I'm ready to write down
what's called the First Law of

00:51:55.049 --> 00:51:59.968
Thermodynamics that talks about
what happens if you make a move

00:51:59.968 --> 00:52:04.650
in the PV plane from one
place to another place.

00:52:04.650 --> 00:52:06.804
If you go from one place to
another place,

00:52:06.804 --> 00:52:09.798
your internal energy will
change from U_1

00:52:09.798 --> 00:52:12.470
to U_2.
Let's call it ΔU.

00:52:16.960 --> 00:52:19.996
We want to ask what causes the
internal energy of the gas to

00:52:19.996 --> 00:52:22.309
change.
So, you guys think about it now.

00:52:22.309 --> 00:52:24.669
Now that you know all about
what's happening in the

00:52:24.669 --> 00:52:27.170
cylinder, you can ask how I will
change the energy?

00:52:27.170 --> 00:52:29.859
Well, if you wanted to change
the energy of a system,

00:52:29.859 --> 00:52:31.670
there are two ways you can do
it.

00:52:31.670 --> 00:52:34.059
One is you can do work on the
gas.

00:52:34.059 --> 00:52:37.670
Another thing is you can put
the gas on a hotplate.

00:52:37.670 --> 00:52:39.862
If you put it on hotplate,
we know it's going to get

00:52:39.862 --> 00:52:41.237
hotter.
If it gets hotter,

00:52:41.237 --> 00:52:43.716
temperature goes up.
If temperature goes up,

00:52:43.716 --> 00:52:47.116
the internal energy goes up.
So, there are two ways to

00:52:47.116 --> 00:52:51.728
change the energy of a gas.
The first one we call heat

00:52:51.728 --> 00:52:54.390
input.
That just means put it on

00:52:54.390 --> 00:52:58.040
something hotter and let the
thing heat it up.

00:52:58.040 --> 00:53:01.469
Temperature will go up.
Notice that the internal energy

00:53:01.469 --> 00:53:04.739
of an ideal gas depends only on
the temperature.

00:53:04.739 --> 00:53:07.840
That's something very,
very important.

00:53:07.840 --> 00:53:10.987
I mention it every time I teach
the subject and some people

00:53:10.987 --> 00:53:13.429
forget and lose a lot of points
needlessly.

00:53:13.429 --> 00:53:15.389
So, I'll say it once more with
feeling.

00:53:15.389 --> 00:53:19.309
The energy of an ideal gas
depends only on the temperature.

00:53:19.309 --> 00:53:20.870
If the temperature is not
changed;

00:53:20.870 --> 00:53:25.097
energy has not changed.
So, try to remember that for

00:53:25.097 --> 00:53:28.909
what I do later.
So, the change of the gas,

00:53:28.909 --> 00:53:34.351
this cylinder full that I put
some weights on top and I've got

00:53:34.351 --> 00:53:38.344
gas inside,
it can change either because I

00:53:38.344 --> 00:53:43.010
did, I put in some heat,
or the gas did some work.

00:53:43.010 --> 00:53:48.092
By that, I mean if the gas
expands by pushing out against

00:53:48.092 --> 00:53:52.177
the atmosphere,
then it was doing the work and

00:53:52.177 --> 00:53:56.079
ΔW is the work done by
the gas.

00:53:56.079 --> 00:53:59.986
That's why it comes to the
minus sign, because it's the

00:53:59.986 --> 00:54:03.559
work done by the gas.
If you do work, you lose energy.

00:54:03.559 --> 00:54:05.660
So, what's the formula for work
done?

00:54:05.660 --> 00:54:09.980
Let's calculate that.
If I've got a piston here,

00:54:09.980 --> 00:54:12.539
it's the force times the
distance.

00:54:12.539 --> 00:54:18.568
But the force is the pressure
times the area times the

00:54:18.568 --> 00:54:21.246
distance.
Now, you guys should know

00:54:21.246 --> 00:54:24.897
enough geometry to know the area
of the piston times the distance

00:54:24.897 --> 00:54:27.179
it moves is the change in the
volume.

00:54:27.179 --> 00:54:30.180
So, we can write it as P
times dV.

00:54:30.180 --> 00:54:33.433
That leads to this great law.
Let me write it on a new

00:54:33.433 --> 00:54:37.191
blackboard because we're going
to be playing around with that

00:54:37.191 --> 00:54:38.510
law.
This is law number one.

00:54:41.659 --> 00:54:47.687
The change in the internal
energy of a system is equal to

00:54:47.687 --> 00:54:49.840
ΔQ - PΔV.

00:54:58.320 --> 00:55:01.338
What does it express?
It expresses the Law of

00:55:01.338 --> 00:55:03.766
Conservation of Energy.
It says the energy goes up,

00:55:03.766 --> 00:55:07.050
either because you pushed the
piston or the piston pushed you;

00:55:07.050 --> 00:55:09.615
then you decide what the
overall sign is,

00:55:09.615 --> 00:55:13.330
or you put it on a hotplate.
We are now equating putting it

00:55:13.330 --> 00:55:16.434
on a hotplate as also equivalent
to giving it energy,

00:55:16.434 --> 00:55:19.119
because we identify heat as
simply energy.

00:55:19.119 --> 00:55:23.888
So, if you took the piston and
you nailed the piston so it

00:55:23.888 --> 00:55:27.570
cannot move, and you put it on a
hotplate,

00:55:27.570 --> 00:55:31.000
PdV part will vanish
because there is no ΔV.

00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:34.659
That's the way of heating it,
it is called ΔQ.

00:55:34.659 --> 00:55:37.610
Another thing you can do is
thermally isolate your piston so

00:55:37.610 --> 00:55:39.409
no heat can flow in and out of
it,

00:55:39.409 --> 00:55:42.440
and then you can either have
the volume increase or decrease.

00:55:42.440 --> 00:55:45.702
If the gas expanded,
ΔV is positive and the

00:55:45.702 --> 00:55:49.421
PΔ - PΔV is negative,
and the ΔU would be

00:55:49.421 --> 00:55:51.940
negative;
the gas will lose energy.

00:55:51.940 --> 00:55:55.577
That's because the molecules
are beating up on the piston and

00:55:55.577 --> 00:55:57.795
moving the piston.
Remember, applying a force

00:55:57.795 --> 00:56:00.706
doesn't cost you anything.
But if the point of application

00:56:00.706 --> 00:56:03.556
moves, you do work.
And who's going to pay for it,

00:56:03.556 --> 00:56:05.893
the gas?
It'll pay for it through its

00:56:05.893 --> 00:56:09.276
loss of internal energy.
Conversely, if you push down on

00:56:09.276 --> 00:56:12.414
the gas, ΔV will be
negative and this will become

00:56:12.414 --> 00:56:15.159
positive and the energy of the
gas will go up.

00:56:15.159 --> 00:56:18.430
So, there are two ways to
change the energy of these

00:56:18.430 --> 00:56:20.670
molecules.
In the end, all you want is you

00:56:20.670 --> 00:56:22.900
want the molecules to move
faster than before.

00:56:22.900 --> 00:56:25.786
One is to put them on a
hotplate where there are

00:56:25.786 --> 00:56:28.375
fast-moving molecules.
When they collide with the

00:56:28.375 --> 00:56:30.433
slow-moving molecules,
typically the slow one's a

00:56:30.433 --> 00:56:33.049
little more faster and the fast
one's a little more slower and

00:56:33.049 --> 00:56:35.280
therefore will be a transfer of
kinetic energy.

00:56:35.280 --> 00:56:38.439
Or when you push the piston
down, you can show when a

00:56:38.439 --> 00:56:40.930
molecule collides with a moving
piston.

00:56:40.930 --> 00:56:46.210
It will actually gain energy.
So, that's how you do work.

00:56:46.210 --> 00:56:47.090
That's the first law.

00:56:51.590 --> 00:56:57.628
So, let us now calculate the
work done in a process where a

00:56:57.628 --> 00:57:02.210
gas goes from here to here on an
isotherm.

00:57:05.739 --> 00:57:08.369
Isotherm is a graph of a given
temperature.

00:57:08.369 --> 00:57:13.122
So, this is a graph P
times V equal to

00:57:13.122 --> 00:57:17.130
constant, because PV =
nRT.

00:57:17.130 --> 00:57:19.381
If T is constant,
PV is a constant,

00:57:19.381 --> 00:57:22.196
it's the rectangular hyperbola.
The product of the x and

00:57:22.196 --> 00:57:24.361
y coordinates is
constant, so when the x

00:57:24.361 --> 00:57:26.118
coordinate vanished,
the y will go to

00:57:26.118 --> 00:57:27.938
infinity.
y coordinate vanishes,

00:57:27.938 --> 00:57:31.830
x will go to infinity.
So, you want to take your gas

00:57:31.830 --> 00:57:35.925
for a ride from here to here.
Throughout it's at a certain

00:57:35.925 --> 00:57:41.269
temperature T.
What work is done by you?

00:57:41.269 --> 00:57:43.159
That's a very nice
interpretation.

00:57:43.159 --> 00:57:49.389
The work done by you is the
integral of PdV.

00:57:49.389 --> 00:57:51.190
But what is integral of
PdV?

00:57:51.190 --> 00:57:54.610
That's P,
and that's dV.

00:57:54.610 --> 00:57:57.420
Pdv is that shaded
region.

00:57:57.420 --> 00:58:00.161
In other words,
if you just write PdV it

00:58:00.161 --> 00:58:03.005
makes absolutely no sense.
If you go to a mathematician

00:58:03.005 --> 00:58:04.770
and say, "Please do the integral
for me!"

00:58:04.770 --> 00:58:10.627
can the mathematician do this?
What's coming in the way of the

00:58:10.627 --> 00:58:14.050
mathematician actually doing the
integral?

00:58:14.050 --> 00:58:17.070
What do you have to know to
really do an integral?

00:58:17.070 --> 00:58:19.159
Student: You have to
know the function.

00:58:19.159 --> 00:58:19.979
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: You have to know

00:58:19.979 --> 00:58:21.087
the function.
If you just say P,

00:58:21.087 --> 00:58:23.064
we'll say maybe P is a
constant, in which case I'll

00:58:23.064 --> 00:58:25.873
pull it out of the integral.
But for this problem,

00:58:25.873 --> 00:58:29.919
because PV is
nRT, and T is a

00:58:29.919 --> 00:58:32.911
constant,
P is nRT divided

00:58:32.911 --> 00:58:36.782
by V, and that's the
function that you would need to

00:58:36.782 --> 00:58:39.814
do the integral,
and if you did that you will

00:58:39.814 --> 00:58:42.530
find there's nRT.
All of them are constants.

00:58:42.530 --> 00:58:45.596
They come out of the integral,
dv over V,

00:58:45.596 --> 00:58:48.889
and integrate from the initial
volume, the final volume.

00:58:48.889 --> 00:58:52.437
And you guys know this is a
logarithm, and the log of upper

00:58:52.437 --> 00:58:55.190
minus log of lower is the log of
the ratio.

00:58:55.190 --> 00:59:00.751
And this gives me nRT
ln (V_2

00:59:00.751 --> 00:59:05.646
/V_1).
So, we have done our first work

00:59:05.646 --> 00:59:08.138
calculation.
When the gas goes on an

00:59:08.138 --> 00:59:11.681
isothermal trajectory from start
to finish, from volume

00:59:11.681 --> 00:59:15.289
V_1 to volume
V_2,

00:59:15.289 --> 00:59:18.177
the work done,
this is the work done by the

00:59:18.177 --> 00:59:20.297
gas.
You can all see that gas is

00:59:20.297 --> 00:59:23.460
expanding and that's equal to
this shaded region.

00:59:29.019 --> 00:59:33.279
By the way, I mention it now,
I don't want to distract you,

00:59:33.279 --> 00:59:37.171
but suppose later on I make it
go backwards like this,

00:59:37.171 --> 00:59:40.340
part of the way.
The work done on the going

00:59:40.340 --> 00:59:43.739
backwards part is this area,
but with a minus sign.

00:59:43.739 --> 00:59:46.325
I hope you will understand,
if you go to the right the

00:59:46.325 --> 00:59:48.708
area's considered positive.
If you go to the left,

00:59:48.708 --> 00:59:50.159
the area is considered
negative.

00:59:50.159 --> 00:59:52.223
If you do the integral and put
the right limit,

00:59:52.223 --> 00:59:54.664
you'll get the right answer.
But geometrically,

00:59:54.664 --> 00:59:58.312
the area under the graph in the
PV diagram is the work

00:59:58.312 --> 01:00:01.960
done if you're moving the
direction of increasing volume.

01:00:01.960 --> 01:00:04.576
If you would decrease the
volume, for example,

01:00:04.576 --> 01:00:07.773
if you just went back from
here, the area looks the same

01:00:07.773 --> 01:00:10.389
but the work done is considered
negative.

01:00:10.389 --> 01:00:13.070
You don't have to think very
hard.

01:00:13.070 --> 01:00:15.338
If you do the calculation going
backwards, you will get a

01:00:15.338 --> 01:00:16.837
ln of
V_1 over

01:00:16.837 --> 01:00:18.740
V_2.
That'll automatically be the

01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:20.236
negative of the log of
V_2 over

01:00:20.236 --> 01:00:21.881
V_1.
But geometrically,

01:00:21.881 --> 01:00:24.819
the area under the graph is the
work, if you are going to the

01:00:24.819 --> 01:00:26.050
right.
Yes?

01:00:26.050 --> 01:00:29.825
Student: What determines
the shape of the curve that

01:00:29.825 --> 01:00:32.690
links the first state to the
second state?

01:00:32.690 --> 01:00:33.938
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Oh,

01:00:33.938 --> 01:00:35.429
this one?
Student: Mmm-hmm.

01:00:35.429 --> 01:00:38.311
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: This'll be a graph,

01:00:38.311 --> 01:00:40.659
PV equal to essentially
a constant.

01:00:40.659 --> 01:00:42.936
So, you take your gas,
you see how many moles there

01:00:42.936 --> 01:00:43.989
are.
You know R,

01:00:43.989 --> 01:00:46.370
you know the temperature,
you promised not to change the

01:00:46.370 --> 01:00:48.692
temperature.
So, you'll move on a trajectory

01:00:48.692 --> 01:00:51.119
so that the product PV
never changes.

01:00:51.119 --> 01:00:54.529
And in any xy plane,
if you draw a graph where the

01:00:54.529 --> 01:00:58.305
product xy doesn't change
it'll have this shape called a

01:00:58.305 --> 01:01:00.813
"rectangular hyperbola."
It just means,

01:01:00.813 --> 01:01:03.624
whenever one increases,
the other should decrease,

01:01:03.624 --> 01:01:06.912
keeping the product constant.
That's why P is

01:01:06.912 --> 01:01:10.677
proportional to the reciprocal
of V when you do the

01:01:10.677 --> 01:01:12.699
integral.
Very good.

01:01:12.699 --> 01:01:16.850
So, this is now the work done
by the gas.

01:01:16.850 --> 01:01:21.158
What is the heat input?
The heat input is a change in

01:01:21.158 --> 01:01:24.780
internal energy minus the work
done.

01:01:24.780 --> 01:01:29.850
Let me see.
The law was ΔU = ΔQ -

01:01:29.850 --> 01:01:32.260
ΔW.
Yeah, let's go back to this law.

01:01:35.489 --> 01:01:38.018
In this problem,
ΔW is what I just

01:01:38.018 --> 01:01:40.485
calculated, nRT,
whatever the log,

01:01:40.485 --> 01:01:43.630
V_2 over
V_1.

01:01:43.630 --> 01:01:49.790
What is ΔQ?
How much heat has been put into

01:01:49.790 --> 01:01:52.409
this gas?
How do I find that?

01:01:52.409 --> 01:01:54.550
Student: Take out the
T?

01:01:54.550 --> 01:01:55.550
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Pardon me?

01:01:55.550 --> 01:01:58.070
Student: You take out
the T?

01:01:58.070 --> 01:02:00.190
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: For the heat input

01:02:00.190 --> 01:02:01.679
you mean?
Yeah, you can use mc

01:02:01.679 --> 01:02:03.869
ΔT, but you don't have to
do anymore work.

01:02:03.869 --> 01:02:06.880
By that, I mean you don't have
to do any more cerebration.

01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:10.744
What can you do with this
equation to avoid doing further

01:02:10.744 --> 01:02:13.430
calculations?
Do you know anything else?

01:02:13.430 --> 01:02:17.638
Yes?
Student: [inaudible]

01:02:17.638 --> 01:02:19.929
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Yes.

01:02:19.929 --> 01:02:23.175
This is what I told you is the
fact that people do not

01:02:23.175 --> 01:02:25.380
constantly remember,
but you must.

01:02:25.380 --> 01:02:27.820
This gas did not change its
temperature.

01:02:27.820 --> 01:02:31.000
Go back to equation number
whatever I wrote down.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.400
U = 3/2 nRT or
something.

01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:35.250
T doesn't change,
U doesn't change.

01:02:35.250 --> 01:02:38.502
That means the initial internal
energy and final internal energy

01:02:38.502 --> 01:02:41.032
are the same because initial
temperature and final

01:02:41.032 --> 01:02:44.099
temperature are the same.
So, this guy has to be zero.

01:02:44.099 --> 01:02:50.489
That means ΔQ is the
same as ΔW in this

01:02:50.489 --> 01:02:53.699
particular case.
Yes?

01:02:53.699 --> 01:02:57.120
Student: [inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

01:02:57.120 --> 01:03:01.028
Shankar: When you say mc
ΔT, you've got to be

01:03:01.028 --> 01:03:04.099
careful of what formula you want
to use.

01:03:04.099 --> 01:03:10.280
I'll tell you why you cannot
simply use mc ΔT.

01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:12.332
If you've got a solid and you
use mc ΔT,

01:03:12.332 --> 01:03:14.122
that is correct,
because when you heat the

01:03:14.122 --> 01:03:16.830
solid, the heat you put in goes
into heating up the solid.

01:03:20.059 --> 01:03:21.690
Maybe let's ask the following
question.

01:03:21.690 --> 01:03:25.255
His question is the following.
You're telling me you put heat

01:03:25.255 --> 01:03:29.343
into a gas, right?
And you say temperature doesn't

01:03:29.343 --> 01:03:31.260
go up.
How can that possibly be?

01:03:31.260 --> 01:03:33.718
I always thought when I put
heat into something,

01:03:33.718 --> 01:03:36.213
temperature goes up.
That's because you were

01:03:36.213 --> 01:03:39.252
thinking about a solid,
where if you put in heat it's

01:03:39.252 --> 01:03:42.699
got to go somewhere and,
of course, temperature goes up.

01:03:42.699 --> 01:03:44.860
What do you think is happening
to the gas here?

01:03:44.860 --> 01:03:48.079
Think of the piston and weight
combination.

01:03:48.079 --> 01:03:54.064
When I want to go along this
path from here to here,

01:03:54.064 --> 01:04:01.105
you can ask yourself where is
the heat input and where is the

01:04:01.105 --> 01:04:04.826
change in energy,
and why is there no change in

01:04:04.826 --> 01:04:07.862
temperature?
If you take a piston like this,

01:04:07.862 --> 01:04:12.407
if you want to increase the
volume, you can certainly take

01:04:12.407 --> 01:04:14.800
off a grain of sand,
right?

01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:18.325
If you took the grain of sand
and the piston will move up,

01:04:18.325 --> 01:04:21.171
it will do work and it actually
will cool down,

01:04:21.171 --> 01:04:23.460
but that's not what you're
doing.

01:04:23.460 --> 01:04:26.467
You are keeping it on a
hotplate at a certain

01:04:26.467 --> 01:04:29.679
temperature so that if it tries
to cool down,

01:04:29.679 --> 01:04:32.960
heat flows from below to above
maintaining the temperature.

01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:36.898
So, what the gas is doing in
this case is taking heat energy

01:04:36.898 --> 01:04:40.702
from below and going up and
working against the atmosphere

01:04:40.702 --> 01:04:42.487
above.
It takes in with one hand and

01:04:42.487 --> 01:04:44.530
gives out to the other,
without changing its energy.

01:04:49.139 --> 01:04:51.816
So, when you study specific
heat, which is my next topic,

01:04:51.816 --> 01:04:54.541
you've got to be a little more
careful when you talk about

01:04:54.541 --> 01:04:56.909
specific heats of gases,
and I will tell you why.

01:04:56.909 --> 01:04:59.460
There is no single thing called
specific heat for a gas.

01:04:59.460 --> 01:05:02.141
There are many,
many definitions depending on

01:05:02.141 --> 01:05:04.724
the circumstances.
But I hope you understand in

01:05:04.724 --> 01:05:07.409
this case;
you've got to visualize this.

01:05:07.409 --> 01:05:09.659
It's not enough to draw
diagrams and draw pictures.

01:05:09.659 --> 01:05:13.110
What did I do to the cylinder
to maintain the temperature and

01:05:13.110 --> 01:05:16.669
yet let it expand?
Expansion is going to demand

01:05:16.669 --> 01:05:20.381
work on part of the gas.
That's going to require a loss

01:05:20.381 --> 01:05:22.880
of energy unless you pump in
energy from below.

01:05:22.880 --> 01:05:26.085
So, what I've done is that I
take grain after grain,

01:05:26.085 --> 01:05:29.480
so that the pressure drops and
the volume increases,

01:05:29.480 --> 01:05:32.755
but the slight expansion would
have cooled it slightly but the

01:05:32.755 --> 01:05:35.978
reservoir from below brings it
back to the temperature of the

01:05:35.978 --> 01:05:37.891
reservoir.
So, you prop it up in

01:05:37.891 --> 01:05:40.027
temperature.
So, we draw the picture by

01:05:40.027 --> 01:05:43.243
saying the gas went from here to
here, and we usually draw a

01:05:43.243 --> 01:05:46.458
picture like this and say heat
flowed into the system during

01:05:46.458 --> 01:05:50.092
that process.
Alright, now I'll come to this

01:05:50.092 --> 01:05:54.159
question that was raised about
specific heat.

01:05:54.159 --> 01:05:58.928
Now, specific heat,
you always say is ΔQ

01:05:58.928 --> 01:06:04.509
over ΔT or ΔT
divided by the mass of the

01:06:04.509 --> 01:06:07.820
substance.
Now, it turns out that for a

01:06:07.820 --> 01:06:11.735
gas, you've already seen that
what you want to count is not

01:06:11.735 --> 01:06:14.030
the actual mass,
but the moles.

01:06:14.030 --> 01:06:17.840
Because we have seen at the
level of the ideal gas law,

01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:21.157
the energy is controlled by not
simply the mass,

01:06:21.157 --> 01:06:24.402
but by the moles.
Because every molecule gets a

01:06:24.402 --> 01:06:27.320
certain amount of energy,
namely 3/2 kT,

01:06:27.320 --> 01:06:29.393
and you just want to count the
number of molecules,

01:06:29.393 --> 01:06:31.926
or the number of moles.
Now, there are many,

01:06:31.926 --> 01:06:36.491
many ways in which you can pump
in heat into a gas and heat it

01:06:36.491 --> 01:06:39.260
up and see how much heat it
takes.

01:06:39.260 --> 01:06:42.949
But let's agree that we will
take one mole from now on and

01:06:42.949 --> 01:06:48.030
not one kilogram.
Not one kilogram.

01:06:48.030 --> 01:06:52.211
We'll find out if you do it
that way, the answer doesn't

01:06:52.211 --> 01:06:55.570
seem to depend on the gas.
That's the first thing.

01:06:55.570 --> 01:06:59.367
Take a mole of some gas and
call the specific heat as the

01:06:59.367 --> 01:07:03.164
energy needed to raise the
temperature of one mole by one

01:07:03.164 --> 01:07:05.670
degree.
So, this should not be m.

01:07:05.670 --> 01:07:07.070
This should be the number of
moles.

01:07:10.409 --> 01:07:13.081
If you take one mole,
you can say okay,

01:07:13.081 --> 01:07:17.650
one mole of gas I was told has
energy U = 3/2 RT.

01:07:22.429 --> 01:07:25.101
Because it was there-halves
nRT but n is one

01:07:25.101 --> 01:07:27.569
mole.
Now, you want to put in some

01:07:27.569 --> 01:07:32.000
heat, and you really want the
ΔQ over ΔT,

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:35.876
so I will remind you that
ΔQ is ΔU +

01:07:35.876 --> 01:07:36.940
PΔv.

01:07:40.070 --> 01:07:43.601
The heat input into a gas is
the change of energy plus P

01:07:43.601 --> 01:07:45.504
Δv.
And that's just from the first

01:07:45.504 --> 01:07:48.347
law.
So, if I'm going to divide

01:07:48.347 --> 01:07:53.400
ΔQ by ΔT,
there's a problem here.

01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:56.126
Did you allow the volume to
change or did you not allow the

01:07:56.126 --> 01:07:58.930
volume to change?
That's going to decide what the

01:07:58.930 --> 01:08:01.090
specific heat is.
In other words,

01:08:01.090 --> 01:08:04.800
when a solid is heated,
it expands such a tiny amount,

01:08:04.800 --> 01:08:08.719
we don't worry about the work
done by the expanding solid

01:08:08.719 --> 01:08:11.501
against the atmosphere.
But for a gas,

01:08:11.501 --> 01:08:14.317
when you heat it,
the volume changes so much that

01:08:14.317 --> 01:08:16.956
the work it does against the
external world is

01:08:16.956 --> 01:08:20.549
non-negligible.
Therefore, the specific heat is

01:08:20.549 --> 01:08:24.529
dependent on what you allow the
volume term to do.

01:08:24.529 --> 01:08:27.787
So, there's one definition of
specific heat called

01:08:27.787 --> 01:08:31.244
C_V,
and C_V is the

01:08:31.244 --> 01:08:34.640
one at constant volume.
You don't let the volume change.

01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:36.771
In other words,
you take the piston and you

01:08:36.771 --> 01:08:39.073
clamp it.
Now, you pump in heat from

01:08:39.073 --> 01:08:41.420
below by putting it on a
hotplate.

01:08:41.420 --> 01:08:44.300
All the heat goes directly to
internal energy.

01:08:44.300 --> 01:08:47.360
None of that is lost in terms
of expansion.

01:08:47.360 --> 01:08:50.136
So, ΔV is zero.
In that case,

01:08:50.136 --> 01:08:53.795
ΔQ over ΔT at
constant volume,

01:08:53.795 --> 01:08:57.797
we denote that in this fashion,
at constant volume,

01:08:57.797 --> 01:09:00.922
this term is gone,
and it just becomes ΔU

01:09:00.922 --> 01:09:03.220
over ΔT.
That's very easily done.

01:09:03.220 --> 01:09:06.360
ΔU over ΔT is
3/2 R.

01:09:11.359 --> 01:09:16.016
So, the specific heat of a gas
at constant volume is 3 over

01:09:16.016 --> 01:09:17.983
2R.
When I studied solids,

01:09:17.983 --> 01:09:20.674
I never bother about constant
volume because a change in the

01:09:20.674 --> 01:09:23.319
volume of a solid is so
negligible when it's heated up,

01:09:23.319 --> 01:09:26.635
it's not worth specifying that
it was a constant volume

01:09:26.635 --> 01:09:27.976
process.
But for a gas,

01:09:27.976 --> 01:09:31.090
it's going to matter whether it
was constant volume or not.

01:09:31.090 --> 01:09:35.310
Then, there's a second specific
heat people like to define.

01:09:35.310 --> 01:09:39.079
That's done as follows.
You take this piston.

01:09:39.079 --> 01:09:41.430
You have some gas at some
pressure.

01:09:41.430 --> 01:09:45.649
You pump in some heat but you
don't clamp the piston.

01:09:45.649 --> 01:09:49.103
You let the piston expand any
way it wants at the same

01:09:49.103 --> 01:09:50.518
pressure.
For example,

01:09:50.518 --> 01:09:53.023
if it's being pushed down by
the atmosphere,

01:09:53.023 --> 01:09:56.343
you let the piston move up if
it wants to, maintaining the

01:09:56.343 --> 01:09:59.438
same pressure.
Well, if it moves up a little

01:09:59.438 --> 01:10:03.552
bit, then the correct equation
is the heat that you put in is

01:10:03.552 --> 01:10:07.939
the change in internal energy
plus P times ΔV,

01:10:07.939 --> 01:10:10.896
where now P is some
constant pressure,

01:10:10.896 --> 01:10:14.237
say the atmospheric pressure,
ΔV is the change in

01:10:14.237 --> 01:10:16.559
volume.
So, ΔQ needed now will

01:10:16.559 --> 01:10:20.457
be more, because you're pumping
in heat from below and you're

01:10:20.457 --> 01:10:24.420
losing energy above because
you're letting the gas expand.

01:10:24.420 --> 01:10:27.429
Because you were letting the
pressure be controlled from the

01:10:27.429 --> 01:10:32.346
outside at some fixed value.
So now, ΔQ--this

01:10:32.346 --> 01:10:37.989
ΔU will be 3 over
2RΔT.

01:10:37.989 --> 01:10:40.930
Now, what's the change in
P times ΔV?

01:10:40.930 --> 01:10:42.890
Here is where you should know
your calculus.

01:10:42.890 --> 01:10:46.200
The P times change in
V is the same as the

01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:49.150
change in PV,
if P is a constant.

01:10:49.150 --> 01:10:51.571
Right?
Remember long back when I did

01:10:51.571 --> 01:10:53.970
rate of change of momentum is
d/dt of mv,

01:10:53.970 --> 01:10:55.463
it's m times
dv/dt,

01:10:55.463 --> 01:10:57.050
because m doesn't
change.

01:10:57.050 --> 01:10:58.830
You can take it inside the
change.

01:10:58.830 --> 01:11:03.650
But now we use PV = RT.
I'm talking about one mole.

01:11:03.650 --> 01:11:07.495
PV = RT.
That's a change in the quantity

01:11:07.495 --> 01:11:11.249
RT, R is a
constant, that's R times

01:11:11.249 --> 01:11:15.140
ΔT so I put in here
R times ΔT.

01:11:15.140 --> 01:11:19.680
This is the ΔQ at
constant pressure.

01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:23.630
So, the specific heat of
constant pressure is ΔQ

01:11:23.630 --> 01:11:27.149
over ΔT,
keeping the pressure constant.

01:11:27.149 --> 01:11:30.041
You divide everything by
ΔT you get 3 over

01:11:30.041 --> 01:11:32.873
2R, plus another
R, which is 5 over

01:11:32.873 --> 01:11:33.700
2R.

01:11:39.970 --> 01:11:43.457
So, the thing you have to
remember, what I did in the end,

01:11:43.457 --> 01:11:46.640
is that a gas doesn't have a
single specific heat.

01:11:46.640 --> 01:11:48.688
If we just say,
put in some heat and tell me

01:11:48.688 --> 01:11:51.022
how many calories I need to
raise the temperature,

01:11:51.022 --> 01:11:53.837
that's not enough.
You have to tell me whether in

01:11:53.837 --> 01:11:56.430
the interim, the gas was fixed
in its volume,

01:11:56.430 --> 01:11:59.789
or changed its volume,
or obeyed some other condition.

01:11:59.789 --> 01:12:03.332
The two most popular conditions
people consider are either the

01:12:03.332 --> 01:12:06.409
volume cannot change or the
pressure cannot change.

01:12:06.409 --> 01:12:09.266
If the volume cannot change,
then the change in the heat you

01:12:09.266 --> 01:12:12.220
put in goes directly to internal
energy, from the First Law of

01:12:12.220 --> 01:12:14.928
Thermodynamics.
That gives you a specific heat

01:12:14.928 --> 01:12:17.990
of 3 over 2R.
If the pressure cannot change,

01:12:17.990 --> 01:12:20.177
you get 5 over 2R.
You can see

01:12:20.177 --> 01:12:23.263
C_P is bigger
than C_V

01:12:23.263 --> 01:12:25.619
because when you let the piston
expand,

01:12:25.619 --> 01:12:29.470
then not all the heat is going
to heat the gas.

01:12:29.470 --> 01:12:32.778
Some of it is dissipated on top
by working against the

01:12:32.778 --> 01:12:37.449
atmosphere.
Then, notice that I've not told

01:12:37.449 --> 01:12:42.061
you what gas it is.
That's why the specific heat

01:12:42.061 --> 01:12:46.455
per mole is the right thing to
think about because then the

01:12:46.455 --> 01:12:50.850
answer does not depend on what
particular gas you took.

01:12:50.850 --> 01:12:54.233
Whether it's hydrogen or
helium, they all have the same

01:12:54.233 --> 01:12:57.567
specific heat per mole.
They won't have the same

01:12:57.567 --> 01:12:59.850
specific heat per gram,
right?

01:12:59.850 --> 01:13:03.274
Because one gram of helium and
one gram of hydrogen don't have

01:13:03.274 --> 01:13:06.063
the same number of moles.
So, you have to remember that

01:13:06.063 --> 01:13:08.470
we're talking about moles.
The final thing I have to

01:13:08.470 --> 01:13:10.180
caution you--very,
very important.

01:13:10.180 --> 01:13:12.910
This is for a monoatomic gas.

01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:21.630
This is for a gas whose atom is
the gas itself.

01:13:21.630 --> 01:13:24.042
It's a point.
Its only energy is kinetic

01:13:24.042 --> 01:13:26.063
energy.
There are diatomic gases,

01:13:26.063 --> 01:13:28.409
by two of them [atoms]
joined together,

01:13:28.409 --> 01:13:30.939
they can form a dumbbell or
something;

01:13:30.939 --> 01:13:33.684
then the energy of the dumbbell
has got two parts,

01:13:33.684 --> 01:13:37.107
as you learned long ago.
It can rotate around some axis

01:13:37.107 --> 01:13:41.059
and it can also move in space.
Then the internal energy has

01:13:41.059 --> 01:13:43.737
also got two parts.
Energy due to motion of the

01:13:43.737 --> 01:13:45.820
center of mass and energy due to
rotation.

01:13:45.820 --> 01:13:49.165
Some molecules also vibrate.
So, there are lots of

01:13:49.165 --> 01:13:51.571
complicated things,
but if you got only one guy,

01:13:51.571 --> 01:13:53.666
or one atom,
whatever its mass is,

01:13:53.666 --> 01:13:57.328
it cannot rotate around itself
and it cannot vibrate around

01:13:57.328 --> 01:13:59.819
itself,
so those energies all disappear.

01:13:59.819 --> 01:14:03.250
So, we have taken the simplest
one of a monoatomic gas,

01:14:03.250 --> 01:14:07.061
a gas whose fundamental entity
is a single atom rather than a

01:14:07.061 --> 01:14:09.644
complicated molecule.
And that's all you're

01:14:09.644 --> 01:14:11.699
responsible for.
I'll just say one thing.

01:14:11.699 --> 01:14:13.301
C_P over
C_V,

01:14:13.301 --> 01:14:15.460
I want to mention it before you
run off to do your homework.

01:14:15.460 --> 01:14:17.985
I don't know if it comes up.
It's called γ,

01:14:17.985 --> 01:14:20.449
that's five-third for a
monoatomic gas.

01:14:20.449 --> 01:14:22.340
You can just take the ratio of
the numbers.

01:14:22.340 --> 01:14:25.944
If in some problem you find
γ is not five-thirds,

01:14:25.944 --> 01:14:29.218
do not panic.
It just means it's a gas which

01:14:29.218 --> 01:14:31.747
is not monoatomic.
If it's not monoatomic,

01:14:31.747 --> 01:14:33.930
these numbers don't have
exactly those values.

01:14:33.930 --> 01:14:37.048
We don't have to go beyond that.
You just have to know there's a

01:14:37.048 --> 01:14:38.669
ratio γ,
which is five-thirds in the

01:14:38.669 --> 01:14:40.307
simplest case,
but in some problem,

01:14:40.307 --> 01:14:42.902
somewhere in your life,
you can get a γ which

01:14:42.902 --> 01:14:44.235
is not five-thirds.

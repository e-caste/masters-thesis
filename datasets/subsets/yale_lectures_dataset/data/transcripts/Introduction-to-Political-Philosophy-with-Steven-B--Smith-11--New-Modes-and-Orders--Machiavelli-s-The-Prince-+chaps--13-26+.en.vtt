00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:08.881
Professor Steven Smith:
Last time, I ended by talking

00:00:08.881 --> 00:00:16.293
about Machiavelli as both a
revolutionary in many ways and a

00:00:16.293 --> 00:00:23.077
reformer of the moral vocabulary
about virtue and vice,

00:00:23.077 --> 00:00:28.450
good and evil.
Machiavelli seeks to replace,

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:33.580
to transpose an older
vocabulary associated both with

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:37.803
Plato and certainly,
perhaps more importantly,

00:00:37.803 --> 00:00:41.788
with biblical sources,
wants to transform altogether

00:00:41.788 --> 00:00:46.110
the language of virtue,
to give it a new kind of

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.264
meaning, to change it from
either Platonic or Christian

00:00:51.264 --> 00:00:56.610
otherworldliness to a greater
sense of worldly power.

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.694
Virtue is, for him,
or to use his term again,

00:00:59.694 --> 00:01:03.268
virtù is related with
manliness, with force,

00:01:03.268 --> 00:01:05.545
with power.
He tells us,

00:01:05.545 --> 00:01:10.751
in chapter 25 of The
Prince, the ethic of the

00:01:10.751 --> 00:01:16.978
prince must be one of audacity
and even more audacity and that

00:01:16.978 --> 00:01:21.470
famous and very volatile image
he uses,

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.331
fortune is a woman and you must
know how- the prince must know

00:01:25.331 --> 00:01:29.848
how to conquer the woman,
must be used through policies

00:01:29.848 --> 00:01:32.849
of force, brutality,
audacity.

00:01:32.849 --> 00:01:35.690
This is the language of
Machiavelli.

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:42.256
Virtue is associated with the
quest for worldly glory,

00:01:42.256 --> 00:01:47.213
with ambition,
with the desire to achieve

00:01:47.213 --> 00:01:50.603
success,
and that's what I want to talk

00:01:50.603 --> 00:01:54.933
about at greater length today.
I want to talk about what in

00:01:54.933 --> 00:02:00.168
the political and philosophical
literature about this is called

00:02:00.168 --> 00:02:05.463
the problem of "dirty hands."
And if you want to join the

00:02:05.463 --> 00:02:09.498
political game,
you must be prepared to get

00:02:09.498 --> 00:02:15.573
your hands dirty,
and what Machiavelli means by

00:02:15.573 --> 00:02:20.729
that, how he comes to this
problem.

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:27.196
In order, he argues,
to effect a transformation of

00:02:27.196 --> 00:02:30.759
European morality,
it is,

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:33.145
in other words,
to teach the prince,

00:02:33.145 --> 00:02:36.349
as he says in chapter 15,
how not to be good,

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:40.330
you have to go to the source of
the morality.

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:41.770
You have to go to the source of
morality.

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:45.344
To affect the maxims,
to affect the standards that

00:02:45.344 --> 00:02:48.626
govern our lives,
it is necessary to go to the

00:02:48.626 --> 00:02:52.930
source of those standards and
those maxims and that can only

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.648
be found in religion.
Oddly, it seems in some ways,

00:02:57.648 --> 00:03:02.482
religion does not seem to be a
major theme of The

00:03:02.482 --> 00:03:06.555
Prince.
In a memorable passage from

00:03:06.555 --> 00:03:12.759
chapter 18, Machiavelli advises
the prince always to cultivate

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:17.229
the appearance of religion.
The prince, he writes,

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:20.261
should appear all mercy,
all faith, all honesty,

00:03:20.261 --> 00:03:25.092
all humanity and all religion,
he writes, adding nothing is

00:03:25.092 --> 00:03:30.110
more necessary to appear to have
this last quality.

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:34.035
The point is clear.
The appearance of religion,

00:03:34.035 --> 00:03:36.788
by which he clearly means
Christianity,

00:03:36.788 --> 00:03:40.699
is good while the actual
practice of it is harmful.

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:44.835
Think about the way in which
that transforms what Plato says

00:03:44.835 --> 00:03:48.691
about justice in his answer to
Glaucon in Book II of the

00:03:48.691 --> 00:03:52.616
Republic where…or
Thrasymachus…where they both

00:03:52.616 --> 00:03:56.829
say it is more important,
is it not more important to

00:03:56.829 --> 00:04:01.210
have the appearance of being
just than the reality of it?

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:04.573
And here, you see Machiavelli
in a way adding his voice to

00:04:04.573 --> 00:04:07.367
that chorus.
It is much better to have the

00:04:07.367 --> 00:04:10.150
appearance than the reality of
religion.

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.935
But in order to understand or
to discover the core of

00:04:13.935 --> 00:04:16.920
Machiavelli's teachings about
religion,

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:21.218
I have to make a slight detour
away from The Prince and

00:04:21.218 --> 00:04:25.658
to his Discourses on Livy
and in maybe the most important

00:04:25.658 --> 00:04:28.834
chapter of that book,
Book II, chapter 2,

00:04:28.834 --> 00:04:33.377
called "Concerning the Kinds of
People the Romans had to Fight

00:04:33.377 --> 00:04:37.250
and how Obstinately they
Defended their Freedom,"

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:42.221
a long title for a chapter to
be sure, but here Machiavelli

00:04:42.221 --> 00:04:47.364
develops a powerful contrast
between two opposed and mutually

00:04:47.364 --> 00:04:54.490
incompatible moral codes,
the Christian and the pagan.

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:57.247
"If one asks oneself,"
Machiavelli writes,

00:04:57.247 --> 00:05:01.350
"If one asks oneself how it
came about that people of old,"

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:05.488
in olden--in the ancient world,
"were more fond of liberty than

00:05:05.488 --> 00:05:08.919
we are today,
I think the answer," he says,

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:13.944
"is due to the same cause that
makes men today less bold than

00:05:13.944 --> 00:05:18.097
they used to be,"
less bold, "and this is due I

00:05:18.097 --> 00:05:23.480
think to the difference between
our education and that of bygone

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:26.148
days."
So what precisely is the

00:05:26.148 --> 00:05:30.341
difference that Machiavelli
refers to here between our

00:05:30.341 --> 00:05:35.246
education and the education of
bygone days that makes people or

00:05:35.246 --> 00:05:40.310
that made people in the ancient
world more fond of liberty,

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:44.673
as he says, than those of our
contemporaries or Machiavelli's

00:05:44.673 --> 00:05:48.170
contemporaries?
Machiavelli's emphasis here on

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:52.163
education, particularly moral
and religious education,

00:05:52.163 --> 00:05:56.910
is the key difference between
the ancient times and his own.

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:00.267
These two different ages,
he believes,

00:06:00.267 --> 00:06:05.439
advanced two very different
systems of moral and religious

00:06:05.439 --> 00:06:09.280
education,
one based on pagan worldliness

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:13.050
and the other based on Christian
innocence.

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:17.673
And it is that conflict,
as it were, between what we

00:06:17.673 --> 00:06:22.660
might call worldliness and
innocence that is the core of

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:27.283
Machiavelli's moral code.
Let me quote Machiavelli's

00:06:27.283 --> 00:06:30.963
passage from the
Discourses at some length

00:06:30.963 --> 00:06:35.180
because I think it's very
revealing: "Our religion,"

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:39.295
he writes, obviously thinking
of the Catholic Christianity of

00:06:39.295 --> 00:06:42.581
his time.
"Our religion," he writes,

00:06:42.581 --> 00:06:46.767
"has glorified humble and
contemplative men,

00:06:46.767 --> 00:06:51.051
monks, priests,
humble and contemplative men,

00:06:51.051 --> 00:06:56.674
rather than men of action.
It is assigned as man's highest

00:06:56.674 --> 00:07:00.203
good humility,
abnegation, and contempt for

00:07:00.203 --> 00:07:02.998
mundane things,"
whereas the other,

00:07:02.998 --> 00:07:06.726
that is to say the ancient
moral code, "whereas the other

00:07:06.726 --> 00:07:10.189
identified it with magnanimity,
bodily strength,

00:07:10.189 --> 00:07:14.089
and everything that conduces to
make men very bold.

00:07:14.089 --> 00:07:19.236
And if our religion," he says,
"demands that in you there be

00:07:19.236 --> 00:07:24.643
strength what it asks for is the
strength to suffer rather than

00:07:24.643 --> 00:07:27.453
to do bold things."
In other words,

00:07:27.453 --> 00:07:30.506
he says Christian strength,
the strength of the Christian,

00:07:30.506 --> 00:07:34.904
is the strength to suffer,
thinking of Jesus on the Cross

00:07:34.904 --> 00:07:37.653
rather than to,
as he puts it,

00:07:37.653 --> 00:07:41.563
do bold things.
And it is not for Machiavelli

00:07:41.563 --> 00:07:46.198
simply the existence of these
two different moralities that is

00:07:46.198 --> 00:07:49.056
at stake.
By softening morals,

00:07:49.056 --> 00:07:52.267
he believes,
by making us gentler,

00:07:52.267 --> 00:07:57.425
Christianity has had some
deeply perverse effects upon

00:07:57.425 --> 00:08:01.690
politics, so he claims.
This pattern of life,

00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:05.505
Machiavelli continues,
appears to have made the world

00:08:05.505 --> 00:08:09.980
weak and to have handed it over
to the prey of the wicked.

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:13.834
This pattern of life,
this pattern of education,

00:08:13.834 --> 00:08:17.607
of moral education,
introduced by the Bible and

00:08:17.607 --> 00:08:22.199
scripture and Christianity,
has made the world weak.

00:08:22.199 --> 00:08:25.040
In other words,
by teaching humility,

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:27.566
self-abnegation,
purity of heart,

00:08:27.566 --> 00:08:31.827
Christianity has made it
difficult to develop qualities

00:08:31.827 --> 00:08:36.009
necessary for the defense of
political liberty.

00:08:36.009 --> 00:08:40.433
Christianity has made the world
weak or, if you want to use his

00:08:40.433 --> 00:08:44.429
again highly charged word for
that, it has made the world

00:08:44.429 --> 00:08:45.500
effeminate.

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:53.355
Machiavelli would no doubt be
taken up against some board of

00:08:53.355 --> 00:08:58.070
offense today for using such a
term but that's his language.

00:08:58.070 --> 00:09:02.470
What can I say?
This is why he concludes there

00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:06.460
are fewer republics today than
in the time of the ancients

00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:11.009
because we do not have the same
love of freedom that they did.

00:09:11.009 --> 00:09:16.975
Now Machiavelli's explicit
referencing of the ancient civil

00:09:16.975 --> 00:09:21.090
religions, the ancient civil
theology,

00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:26.822
is a direct tribute to the role
of Numa, N-u-m-a,

00:09:26.822 --> 00:09:33.509
in Livy's famous History of
the Roman Republic.

00:09:33.509 --> 00:09:37.641
Justin, who is an authority on
this text, can tell you more

00:09:37.641 --> 00:09:41.854
about it if you like,
but in the opening books of

00:09:41.854 --> 00:09:47.669
Livy, he tells the story of how
Rome was founded by Romulus,

00:09:47.669 --> 00:09:51.536
who had murdered his brother,
Remus, but after this it

00:09:51.536 --> 00:09:56.059
required a second founding and
the second founding was the work

00:09:56.059 --> 00:09:58.807
of a man named Numa,
who, Livy writes,

00:09:58.807 --> 00:10:01.508
determined that Rome,
which had originally been

00:10:01.508 --> 00:10:03.679
established through force of
arms,

00:10:03.679 --> 00:10:07.651
should be reestablished through
justice, laws and proper

00:10:07.651 --> 00:10:10.539
observances, in other words,
religion.

00:10:10.539 --> 00:10:13.544
In order to complete the
founding of the city,

00:10:13.544 --> 00:10:17.217
it was necessary to establish
its gods and ensure proper

00:10:17.217 --> 00:10:21.855
respect for the law.
Numa was the bringer of the

00:10:21.855 --> 00:10:28.600
Roman legal codes respecting
religion, proper observances and

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:33.355
the like.
But Machiavelli uses Livy and

00:10:33.355 --> 00:10:40.048
in the story about Rome's second
founding to bring home an

00:10:40.048 --> 00:10:45.919
important lesson about the
utility of religion.

00:10:45.919 --> 00:10:50.557
"Religion," he tells the
reader, "is not to be evaluated

00:10:50.557 --> 00:10:55.700
by its truth content but for its
consequences for society."

00:10:55.700 --> 00:11:01.335
But the story of Numa or his
use of that story tell us more

00:11:01.335 --> 00:11:06.970
than just a lesson about the
social utility of religion.

00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:12.087
At the time of the founding of
Rome, Machiavelli writes,

00:11:12.087 --> 00:11:17.204
religion was necessary to
temper and control the warlike

00:11:17.204 --> 00:11:22.269
character of the Romans.
Religion had to bring a

00:11:22.269 --> 00:11:27.830
softening effect upon against
the violent and bestial

00:11:27.830 --> 00:11:32.889
character of the early Romans.
But for us today,

00:11:32.889 --> 00:11:36.850
Machiavelli writes,
religion has to serve the

00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:41.017
opposite purpose.
It must instill something of a

00:11:41.017 --> 00:11:45.594
fighting spirit into people who
have lost their instinct to

00:11:45.594 --> 00:11:48.830
resist encroachments on their
liberty.

00:11:48.830 --> 00:11:52.822
In many ways,
this is the deeper meaning of

00:11:52.822 --> 00:11:56.720
Machiavelli's slogan,
"one's own arms."

00:11:56.720 --> 00:12:01.279
He uses in a variety of
passages the formula that a good

00:12:01.279 --> 00:12:06.254
republic depends upon one's own
arms and laws and in a deeper

00:12:06.254 --> 00:12:10.814
sense this idea of "one's own
arms" means developing the

00:12:10.814 --> 00:12:15.539
capacities to resist
encroachments on your freedom.

00:12:15.539 --> 00:12:19.245
The prince, in other words,
has to use religion to

00:12:19.245 --> 00:12:23.859
encourage his subjects to rely
upon their own arms rather than

00:12:23.859 --> 00:12:28.018
on divine promises and that
again is the teaching of his

00:12:28.018 --> 00:12:31.799
retelling of the story of David
and Goliath,

00:12:31.799 --> 00:12:35.082
the biblical story of David and
Goliath, in chapter 13 of The

00:12:35.082 --> 00:12:38.190
Prince.
You remember how Machiavelli

00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:41.490
retells and also rewrites that
story.

00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:46.369
He writes the story saying that
David went armed,

00:12:46.369 --> 00:12:50.740
went into battle with Goliath
armed only,

00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:56.860
he says, with a sling and a
knife, and those of you who know

00:12:56.860 --> 00:13:02.669
the story and checked against
the biblical account of the

00:13:02.669 --> 00:13:08.685
story know that David only went
into battle against Goliath

00:13:08.685 --> 00:13:13.250
armed with Saul's armor and his
sling.

00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:18.110
Machiavelli gives him a knife.
Where did this come from?

00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:24.451
Why does he add this?
His subtle alteration of the

00:13:24.451 --> 00:13:28.850
biblical story is hugely
revealing.

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:33.098
Its moral seems to be "trust in
God's promises,

00:13:33.098 --> 00:13:36.700
yes, but bring a knife just in
case."

00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:44.526
It's like the old joke about
the fighter who went in to the

00:13:44.526 --> 00:13:48.712
ring and before going in to the
ring and he asked the priest to

00:13:48.712 --> 00:13:51.053
pray for him.
He said, "I'll pray for him but

00:13:51.053 --> 00:13:52.170
if he can punch it'll help."

00:13:57.850 --> 00:14:04.379
In a small respect,
that's Machiavelli.

00:14:04.379 --> 00:14:08.546
Machiavelli sensed that his own
country was deeply deficient in

00:14:08.546 --> 00:14:12.787
these martial virtues,
necessary to reassert greatness

00:14:12.787 --> 00:14:16.940
and this was a theme of a
lengthy poem he wrote.

00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:18.110
Yes.
You're surprised.

00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:21.230
Yes, Machiavelli wrote poetry
and plays.

00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:23.255
His play, The
Mandragola,

00:14:23.255 --> 00:14:26.261
is still performed,
but he wrote an interesting

00:14:26.261 --> 00:14:29.105
poem,
a lengthy poem called

00:14:29.105 --> 00:14:33.507
Ambizione,
ambition, something like

00:14:33.507 --> 00:14:38.689
Platonic thumos,
which lamented his countrymen's

00:14:38.689 --> 00:14:43.469
lack of civic spirit and their
need to be reeducated in the art

00:14:43.469 --> 00:14:46.917
of war.
I only want to read a small

00:14:46.917 --> 00:14:52.766
section to you from that poem:
"If you perchance are tempted

00:14:52.766 --> 00:14:57.324
to accuse nature,
if Italy, so wary and wounded,

00:14:57.324 --> 00:15:00.929
does not produce hard and
bellicose people,

00:15:00.929 --> 00:15:05.563
this I say is not sufficient to
erase our cowardice for

00:15:05.563 --> 00:15:10.370
education can supplement where
nature is deficient.

00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:15.584
Stern education made Italy
bloom in ancient days and made

00:15:15.584 --> 00:15:21.730
her rise and conquer the entire
world and for herself make room.

00:15:21.730 --> 00:15:25.915
But now she lives,
if tears can be called life,

00:15:25.915 --> 00:15:31.192
beneath the ruins and unhappy
fate that she has reaped from

00:15:31.192 --> 00:15:34.979
her long lack of strife.
But now she lives,

00:15:34.979 --> 00:15:38.905
if tears can be called life,
beneath the ruins and unhappy

00:15:38.905 --> 00:15:42.899
fate that she has reaped from
her long lack of strife."

00:15:42.899 --> 00:15:46.094
And just from this little
section of the poem,

00:15:46.094 --> 00:15:50.423
you can see that the theme of a
new kind of education and only

00:15:50.423 --> 00:15:53.050
that can remedy nature's
defects,

00:15:53.050 --> 00:15:58.161
as Machiavelli calls them.
It is this lack of strife,

00:15:58.161 --> 00:16:02.279
this long lack of strife,
that makes people weak.

00:16:02.279 --> 00:16:06.159
People are weakened by
prolonged peace and they are

00:16:06.159 --> 00:16:10.039
made strong, fierce and
independent through war.

00:16:10.039 --> 00:16:13.575
Only by hardening themselves,
he says, will it be possible

00:16:13.575 --> 00:16:18.363
for Italy, as he puts it,
"to rise and conquer the entire

00:16:18.363 --> 00:16:24.490
world, in ancient days again and
made her rise and conquer the

00:16:24.490 --> 00:16:28.810
entire world and for herself
make room."

00:16:28.810 --> 00:16:32.431
His point seems to be this.
If you want liberty,

00:16:32.431 --> 00:16:37.566
you have to know how not to be
good, at least as Christianity

00:16:37.566 --> 00:16:41.525
has defined goodness.
The Christian virtue of

00:16:41.525 --> 00:16:46.000
humility, turning the other
cheek, forgiveness of sins,

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:51.221
must be rejected if you want to
do good as opposed to just being

00:16:51.221 --> 00:16:53.429
good.
You have to learn,

00:16:53.429 --> 00:16:56.879
in other words,
how to get your hands dirty.

00:16:56.879 --> 00:17:01.977
Between the innocence of the
Christian and the worldliness of

00:17:01.977 --> 00:17:07.160
Machiavelli's new morality,
there can be no reconciliation.

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:12.650
These are just two incompatible
moral positions that Machiavelli

00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:16.049
states but he goes further than
this.

00:17:16.049 --> 00:17:21.430
The safety and security enjoyed
by the innocents,

00:17:21.430 --> 00:17:27.819
our freedom to live blameless
lives and to have untroubled

00:17:27.819 --> 00:17:31.303
sleep,
depends upon the prince's

00:17:31.303 --> 00:17:35.369
clear-eyed and even ruthless use
of power.

00:17:35.369 --> 00:17:38.026
The true statesman,
the true prince for

00:17:38.026 --> 00:17:42.569
Machiavelli, must be prepared to
mix a love of the common good,

00:17:42.569 --> 00:17:47.909
a love of his own people,
with a streak of cruelty that

00:17:47.909 --> 00:17:54.039
is often regarded as essential
for a great ruler in general,

00:17:54.039 --> 00:17:59.728
another part of knowing how not
to be good, knowing when and how

00:17:59.728 --> 00:18:04.152
to use cruelty or what
Machiavelli tellingly calls

00:18:04.152 --> 00:18:07.022
"cruelty well used."
When it's well used,

00:18:07.022 --> 00:18:07.550
it's a virtue.

00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:15.965
This is simply another example
of how moral goodness grows out

00:18:15.965 --> 00:18:20.000
of and even requires a context
of moral evil.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.529
Machiavelli's advice to you is
clear.

00:18:23.529 --> 00:18:27.630
If you cannot accept the
responsibilities of political

00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:31.730
life, if you cannot afford to
get your hands dirty,

00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:37.019
if you cannot accept the harsh
necessities that may require

00:18:37.019 --> 00:18:42.299
cruelty, deceit and even murder,
then get out of the way,

00:18:42.299 --> 00:18:46.810
then this is not for you.
Don't seem to impose,

00:18:46.810 --> 00:18:52.032
don't seek to impose your own
high-minded innocence,

00:18:52.032 --> 00:18:57.121
sometimes called justice,
your own high-minded innocence

00:18:57.121 --> 00:19:01.045
on the requirements of
statecraft because it will only

00:19:01.045 --> 00:19:04.075
lead to ruin.
In the modern era,

00:19:04.075 --> 00:19:08.482
the presidency of Jimmy Carter,
for example,

00:19:08.482 --> 00:19:13.914
is usually taken as exhibit A
of the confusion between

00:19:13.914 --> 00:19:19.757
Christian humanitarianism and
the necessities of reason of

00:19:19.757 --> 00:19:22.996
state.
If you can't do the tough

00:19:22.996 --> 00:19:27.420
thing, if you can't do the harsh
thing, Machiavelli says,

00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:35.062
then stay out of politics and
don't attempt to impose your

00:19:35.062 --> 00:19:39.890
high-minded morality on the
state.

00:19:39.890 --> 00:19:43.323
As I said at the beginning,
in the philosophical

00:19:43.323 --> 00:19:47.414
literature, this has become
known as the problem of dirty

00:19:47.414 --> 00:19:51.433
hands so named after a famous
play written by the French

00:19:51.433 --> 00:19:56.048
philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre.
The problem of dirty hands

00:19:56.048 --> 00:20:00.007
refers to the conflict of
duties, again conflict of

00:20:00.007 --> 00:20:04.758
moralities between the harsh
requirements of politics and the

00:20:04.758 --> 00:20:08.480
equally demanding desire for
moral purity,

00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:13.051
to keep the world at a distance.
Machiavelli doesn't deny that

00:20:13.051 --> 00:20:16.535
there is something deeply
admirable about the desire to

00:20:16.535 --> 00:20:19.062
remain morally pure,
morally decent,

00:20:19.062 --> 00:20:22.260
morally innocent,
but he just wants to say this

00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:26.569
is a very different morality
from the morality of politics.

00:20:26.569 --> 00:20:29.915
In Sartre's play,
the action takes place in a

00:20:29.915 --> 00:20:34.250
fictional eastern European
country during World War II,

00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:38.995
probably something like
Yugoslavia, where a communist

00:20:38.995 --> 00:20:44.745
resistance fighter reproaches an
idealistic young recruit to the

00:20:44.745 --> 00:20:50.404
resistance who is resisting or
is balking at the order to carry

00:20:50.404 --> 00:20:55.710
out a political assassination.
"Why did you join us?"

00:20:55.710 --> 00:20:57.690
the communist resistance
fighter asks.

00:20:57.690 --> 00:21:00.170
"Purity is an idea for the yogi
or the monk.

00:21:00.170 --> 00:21:03.660
Do you think anyone can govern
innocently?"

00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:08.062
"Do you think anyone can govern
innocently," the phrase taken of

00:21:08.062 --> 00:21:12.199
course from Saint-Just,
one of the leaders of the

00:21:12.199 --> 00:21:17.359
Jacobin Reign of Terror during
the French Revolution.

00:21:17.359 --> 00:21:22.089
What do you think politics is,
a game of moral purity?

00:21:22.089 --> 00:21:27.628
The same kind of conflict is
really very much at the core of

00:21:27.628 --> 00:21:32.039
the great political fiction of
John le Carre,

00:21:32.039 --> 00:21:36.827
the great novelist of the Cold
War and so on,

00:21:36.827 --> 00:21:41.506
and in his great,
one of his early political

00:21:41.506 --> 00:21:44.942
thrillers,
a book called The Spy who

00:21:44.942 --> 00:21:48.494
Came in from the Cold,
he depicts there a British

00:21:48.494 --> 00:21:52.524
agent who was working undercover
and who at the same time is

00:21:52.524 --> 00:21:56.418
carrying on a love affair with
an idealistic young English

00:21:56.418 --> 00:21:59.970
librarian who has joined the
communist party.

00:21:59.970 --> 00:22:02.827
In this case,
she, the communist,

00:22:02.827 --> 00:22:06.841
is the idealistic one.
She's joined the party because

00:22:06.841 --> 00:22:10.583
she believes it will aid the
cause of nuclear disarmament and

00:22:10.583 --> 00:22:13.640
will bring international peace
and when Lemas,

00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:19.124
the spy, reveals to her that he
is a spy, he tells her his view

00:22:19.124 --> 00:22:22.309
of what politics is,
the nature of politics.

00:22:22.309 --> 00:22:27.623
"There's only one law in the
game," Lemas says,

00:22:27.623 --> 00:22:32.359
"the expediency of temporary
alliances.

00:22:32.359 --> 00:22:35.443
Who do you think spies are,
priests, saints,

00:22:35.443 --> 00:22:37.925
martyrs?
They're squalid little men,

00:22:37.925 --> 00:22:40.083
fools, queers,
sadists, drunkards,

00:22:40.083 --> 00:22:43.940
people who play cowboys and
Indians to brighten their rotten

00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:46.027
lives.
Do you think they sit like

00:22:46.027 --> 00:22:47.920
monks weighing up right and
wrong?"

00:22:51.970 --> 00:22:55.047
So both of these cases,
the Sartre case,

00:22:55.047 --> 00:22:59.071
the John le Carre case,
in a way are interesting but

00:22:59.071 --> 00:23:03.175
they're also sort of cases of
what I think of as faux

00:23:03.175 --> 00:23:07.552
Machiavellianism,
kind of intellectuals engaging

00:23:07.552 --> 00:23:12.079
in tough talk to show that they
have really lost their

00:23:12.079 --> 00:23:14.591
innocence,
which is the sort of

00:23:14.591 --> 00:23:17.955
intellectual equivalent of
losing your virginity,

00:23:17.955 --> 00:23:21.740
showing you're not really
innocent about the world.

00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:25.920
Machiavelli of course likes to
play that game and it suggests

00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:30.099
that the world is divided
between the weak and the strong,

00:23:30.099 --> 00:23:35.534
between the realists who see
things the way they are and the

00:23:35.534 --> 00:23:40.599
idealists who require the
comfort of moral illusions.

00:23:40.599 --> 00:23:44.726
Yes, Machiavelli sometimes
seems to corroborate this point

00:23:44.726 --> 00:23:47.470
of view.
Does he not say that armed

00:23:47.470 --> 00:23:51.200
prophets always win,
the unarmed prophets lose?

00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:55.809
Did he not say that he wrote to
reveal the effectual truth of

00:23:55.809 --> 00:24:00.650
things and not just what people
have imagined the case to be?

00:24:00.650 --> 00:24:04.802
Yet it seems inconceivable that
Machiavelli wrote an entire book

00:24:04.802 --> 00:24:09.311
simply to prove the obvious,
that is to say that the strong

00:24:09.311 --> 00:24:14.374
will always crush the weak and
that politics is left to those

00:24:14.374 --> 00:24:17.750
who leave their scruples at the
door.

00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:21.613
The question is,
was Machiavelli really that

00:24:21.613 --> 00:24:27.430
kind of Machiavellian?
Was Machiavelli a Machiavellian?

00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:29.640
Let's see.

00:24:35.690 --> 00:24:41.309
What kind of government did
Machiavelli think best?

00:24:41.309 --> 00:24:44.405
As he indicates at the
beginning of The Prince,

00:24:44.405 --> 00:24:47.852
there are two kinds of regimes:
there are principalities and

00:24:47.852 --> 00:24:50.762
republics.
But each of these regimes,

00:24:50.762 --> 00:24:55.590
he says, is based on certain
contrasting dispositions or what

00:24:55.590 --> 00:24:57.924
he calls humors,
umori,

00:24:57.924 --> 00:25:01.060
humors.
"In every society," he writes,

00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:05.257
this is chapter 9 of The
Prince, "two diverse humors

00:25:05.257 --> 00:25:09.936
are found from which this arise,
that the people desire neither

00:25:09.936 --> 00:25:14.371
to be commanded nor oppressed by
the great and the great desire

00:25:14.371 --> 00:25:17.089
to command and oppress the
people."

00:25:17.089 --> 00:25:21.052
These are the two great
political psychological

00:25:21.052 --> 00:25:24.584
dispositions,
the popular desire not to be

00:25:24.584 --> 00:25:29.580
oppressed and the disposition of
what he calls the great to

00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:33.815
command and oppress.
Machiavelli uses these two

00:25:33.815 --> 00:25:38.190
psychological and even in some
ways quasi-medical terms,

00:25:38.190 --> 00:25:44.715
humors, to designate two
classes of people on which every

00:25:44.715 --> 00:25:49.032
society is based.
His theory of the humors in

00:25:49.032 --> 00:25:53.393
chapter 9 seems in some ways to
be reminiscent of Plato's

00:25:53.393 --> 00:25:58.143
account of the three classes of
the soul or the three parts of

00:25:58.143 --> 00:26:01.180
the soul with one vivid
exception.

00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:06.180
"Each class of the city," he
says, "is bound or determined by

00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:10.263
a humor but neither humor is
anchored in reason or

00:26:10.263 --> 00:26:13.718
rationality."
Every state is divided into two

00:26:13.718 --> 00:26:16.874
classes expressing these two
qualities, these two

00:26:16.874 --> 00:26:19.874
psychological qualities,
the grandi,

00:26:19.874 --> 00:26:23.273
the rich and powerful who wish
to dominate, and the

00:26:23.273 --> 00:26:26.564
popolo,
the common people who wish

00:26:26.564 --> 00:26:31.080
merely to be left alone,
who wish neither to rule nor be

00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:33.954
ruled.
Now, one might expect that the

00:26:33.954 --> 00:26:38.079
author of a book entitled The
Prince would favor the

00:26:38.079 --> 00:26:40.868
great,
would favor the grandi,

00:26:40.868 --> 00:26:44.848
those who desire to rule.
Are not these aristocratic

00:26:44.848 --> 00:26:49.410
goals of honor and glory
precisely what Machiavelli seems

00:26:49.410 --> 00:26:52.795
to be advocating?
Yet in many ways,

00:26:52.795 --> 00:26:58.060
Machiavelli proceeds to
deprecate the virtues of the

00:26:58.060 --> 00:27:01.880
nobility, perhaps to our
surprise.

00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:06.123
The ends of the people,
the ends, the purposes of the

00:27:06.123 --> 00:27:11.019
people, is more decent than that
of the great since the great

00:27:11.019 --> 00:27:15.507
want to oppress and the people
want not to be oppressed,

00:27:15.507 --> 00:27:19.290
he says.
His advice is that the prince

00:27:19.290 --> 00:27:24.752
should seek to build his power
base on the people rather than

00:27:24.752 --> 00:27:28.520
on the nobles.
Because of their ambition for

00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:33.190
power, the nobles will always be
a threat to the prince and,

00:27:33.190 --> 00:27:37.096
in an interesting reversal of
the Platonic and Aristotelian

00:27:37.096 --> 00:27:40.548
conception of politics,
it is the nobles here who are

00:27:40.548 --> 00:27:44.330
said to be the more fickle and
unpredictable and the people are

00:27:44.330 --> 00:27:48.183
more constant and reliable.
Remember in the Platonic and

00:27:48.183 --> 00:27:51.291
Aristotelian view of politics
the democracy,

00:27:51.291 --> 00:27:54.503
the rule of the people,
the demos,

00:27:54.503 --> 00:27:58.974
was always criticized for it
being fickle and unstable and

00:27:58.974 --> 00:28:02.190
subject to whim and passion and
so on.

00:28:02.190 --> 00:28:06.234
Here, Machiavelli tells us it
is the great who are subject to

00:28:06.234 --> 00:28:10.279
this kind of inconstancy and the
people are more reliable.

00:28:10.279 --> 00:28:14.828
The worst, he writes,
that a prince can expect from a

00:28:14.828 --> 00:28:19.465
hostile people is to be
abandoned by them but from the

00:28:19.465 --> 00:28:21.596
great,
when they are hostile,

00:28:21.596 --> 00:28:24.967
he must fear not only being
abandoned but also that they may

00:28:24.967 --> 00:28:26.110
move against him.

00:28:30.799 --> 00:28:35.230
The grandi are more
dangerous and fickle.

00:28:35.230 --> 00:28:38.893
So the main business of
government consists in knowing

00:28:38.893 --> 00:28:42.350
how to control the elites
because they are always a

00:28:42.350 --> 00:28:45.529
potential source of conflict and
ambition.

00:28:45.529 --> 00:28:48.802
The prince must know how to
chasten the ambition,

00:28:48.802 --> 00:28:51.119
to humble the pride,
as it were,

00:28:51.119 --> 00:28:55.751
of the great and powerful,
and this, we will see as early

00:28:55.751 --> 00:28:59.143
as Wednesday,
becomes a major theme in the

00:28:59.143 --> 00:29:04.874
philosophy of Thomas Hobbes,
humbling or chastening the

00:29:04.874 --> 00:29:09.645
pride of the few.
The rule of the prince or

00:29:09.645 --> 00:29:15.969
sovereign requires the ability
to control the ambition and to

00:29:15.969 --> 00:29:21.240
do so through selective policies
of executions,

00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:25.049
of public accusations and
political trials.

00:29:25.049 --> 00:29:29.431
Remember the example that we
read at the end of class on

00:29:29.431 --> 00:29:32.220
Friday, I believe from chapter
7,

00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:37.295
the example of Cesare Borgia
and Remirro d'Orco and how his

00:29:37.295 --> 00:29:41.533
execution, his bloody execution,
left the people,

00:29:41.533 --> 00:29:44.930
Machiavelli says,
stupefied and satisfied?

00:29:44.930 --> 00:29:50.763
Here is a perfect example of
how to control the ambitions of

00:29:50.763 --> 00:29:55.509
the nobles and to win the people
to your side.

00:29:55.509 --> 00:29:59.773
So Machiavelli's prince,
while not exactly a democrat,

00:29:59.773 --> 00:30:04.037
recognizes the essential
decency of the people and the

00:30:04.037 --> 00:30:08.949
need to keep their faith.
And by decency he seems to mean

00:30:08.949 --> 00:30:13.442
their absence of ambition,
the absence of the desire to

00:30:13.442 --> 00:30:18.192
dominate and control.
But this kind of decency is not

00:30:18.192 --> 00:30:23.521
the same as goodness for there
is also a tendency on the part

00:30:23.521 --> 00:30:28.849
of the people to descend into
what Machiavelli calls idleness

00:30:28.849 --> 00:30:32.005
or license.
The desire not to oppress

00:30:32.005 --> 00:30:36.309
others may be decent but at the
same time the people have to be

00:30:36.309 --> 00:30:39.779
taught or educated how to defend
their liberty.

00:30:39.779 --> 00:30:42.257
Fifteen hundred years of
Christianity,

00:30:42.257 --> 00:30:46.006
he says, have left people weak,
have left the people weak

00:30:46.006 --> 00:30:49.019
without their capacities to
exercise political

00:30:49.019 --> 00:30:52.835
responsibility and the resources
to defend themselves from

00:30:52.835 --> 00:30:55.725
attack.
So just as princes must know

00:30:55.725 --> 00:30:58.756
how to control the ambitions of
the multitude,

00:30:58.756 --> 00:31:03.000
how to control the ambitions of
the nobles--excuse me--they,

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:07.073
the princes,
must know how to strengthen the

00:31:07.073 --> 00:31:11.368
desires of the common people.
Some readers of The

00:31:11.368 --> 00:31:14.455
Prince, even some very
astute readers of The

00:31:14.455 --> 00:31:18.295
Prince,
have thought that Machiavelli's

00:31:18.295 --> 00:31:22.038
work is really,
or Machiavelli's prince,

00:31:22.038 --> 00:31:27.989
is really a kind of democrat in
disguise and that the prince is

00:31:27.989 --> 00:31:33.460
intended precisely to alert the
people to the dangers of a

00:31:33.460 --> 00:31:37.795
usurpatory prince.
This is for example what the

00:31:37.795 --> 00:31:41.526
great seventeenth-century
political philosopher Spinoza

00:31:41.526 --> 00:31:44.985
believed about Machiavelli.
In his book called,

00:31:44.985 --> 00:31:48.193
simply called,
The Political Treatise,

00:31:48.193 --> 00:31:51.474
Spinoza wrote:
"Machiavelli wished to show how

00:31:51.474 --> 00:31:55.703
careful a people should be
before entrusting its welfare to

00:31:55.703 --> 00:31:59.422
a single prince.
I am led," Spinoza continues,

00:31:59.422 --> 00:32:03.578
"to this opinion concerning
that most far-seeing man because

00:32:03.578 --> 00:32:07.029
it is known that he was
favorable to liberty."

00:32:07.029 --> 00:32:11.466
That's Spinoza on Machiavelli,
because "he was favorable to

00:32:11.466 --> 00:32:15.903
liberty" and that the book,
he says, is kind of a satire on

00:32:15.903 --> 00:32:18.572
princely rule.
Or, if you don't believe

00:32:18.572 --> 00:32:21.750
Spinoza, if you don't believe
his authority is sufficient,

00:32:21.750 --> 00:32:24.358
consider someone who you'll be
reading in a couple of weeks,

00:32:24.358 --> 00:32:27.730
Jean-Jacques Rousseau,
from the Social Contract.

00:32:27.730 --> 00:32:31.253
"Machiavelli was an honorable
man and a good citizen,"

00:32:31.253 --> 00:32:34.046
Rousseau says,
"an honorable man and a good

00:32:34.046 --> 00:32:36.913
citizen who,
being attached to the House of

00:32:36.913 --> 00:32:39.738
Medici, was forced,
during the oppression of his

00:32:39.738 --> 00:32:42.293
homeland,
to disguise his love of

00:32:42.293 --> 00:32:45.192
freedom."
So, The Prince was

00:32:45.192 --> 00:32:50.490
written in a way that disguised
the real teaching of the book,

00:32:50.490 --> 00:32:54.345
which is the love of freedom
and presumably the freedom of

00:32:54.345 --> 00:32:58.403
the people, something of the
type that Rousseau himself spoke

00:32:58.403 --> 00:32:59.080
about.

00:33:02.420 --> 00:33:06.955
Maybe these comments go too far.
Maybe they are exaggerations

00:33:06.955 --> 00:33:11.669
and I think to some degree they
are but it's revealing that both

00:33:11.669 --> 00:33:16.234
of these very serious readers of
Machiavelli took him to be an

00:33:16.234 --> 00:33:19.322
apostle of freedom.
Spinoza taking him,

00:33:19.322 --> 00:33:23.539
taking his book to be a warning
to the people about the dangers

00:33:23.539 --> 00:33:27.399
of princely rule,
Rousseau believing that he had

00:33:27.399 --> 00:33:32.314
deliberately disguised his love
of freedom because he had to

00:33:32.314 --> 00:33:36.980
appeal to the tyrannical nature
of the Medici family.

00:33:36.980 --> 00:33:38.933
In either case,
they regard him as

00:33:38.933 --> 00:33:42.248
surreptitiously taking the side
of the people against the

00:33:42.248 --> 00:33:42.900
nobles.

00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:50.543
In any case,
whatever one makes of those

00:33:50.543 --> 00:33:55.794
examples, Machiavelli seems to
be challenging important aspects

00:33:55.794 --> 00:34:00.876
of the classical conceptions
that we've been talking about up

00:34:00.876 --> 00:34:04.703
to this point.
In the classical republic,

00:34:04.703 --> 00:34:08.559
for the ancient republic of
Plato and Aristotle,

00:34:08.559 --> 00:34:12.170
these republics were ruled by
nobilities,

00:34:12.170 --> 00:34:17.824
gentlemen possessed of wealth
and leisure, who were therefore

00:34:17.824 --> 00:34:22.159
capable of forming sound
political judgment,

00:34:22.159 --> 00:34:25.688
who will dominate,
while in Machiavelli's state it

00:34:25.688 --> 00:34:29.719
is the people who are going to
be the dominant social and

00:34:29.719 --> 00:34:33.233
political power.
Machiavelli wants to redirect

00:34:33.233 --> 00:34:37.165
power to some degree away from
the nobles and toward the

00:34:37.165 --> 00:34:39.709
people.
One wants to know why,

00:34:39.709 --> 00:34:43.106
why does he want to do that?
In the first place,

00:34:43.106 --> 00:34:46.015
he judges the people to be more
reliable, as he tells us,

00:34:46.015 --> 00:34:48.188
than the great.
Once the people have been

00:34:48.188 --> 00:34:50.765
taught to value their liberty,
have learned to oppose

00:34:50.765 --> 00:34:54.190
encroachments on their freedom,
to be fierce and vigilant

00:34:54.190 --> 00:34:58.159
watchdogs rather than humble and
subservient underlings,

00:34:58.159 --> 00:35:02.856
they will serve as a reliable
basis for the greatness and

00:35:02.856 --> 00:35:07.113
power of a state.
With the people on his side,

00:35:07.113 --> 00:35:12.536
the prince is more likely to
achieve his goals of a robust

00:35:12.536 --> 00:35:18.150
civil life for his people and
eternal glory for himself.

00:35:18.150 --> 00:35:21.394
And, as Machiavelli likes to
say, the prince must know how to

00:35:21.394 --> 00:35:25.360
adapt to the times.
What is true for princes is no

00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:29.982
less true for advisers to
princes like Machiavelli

00:35:29.982 --> 00:35:33.115
himself.
One must know the times and

00:35:33.115 --> 00:35:36.786
character of a people.
In the ancient republic,

00:35:36.786 --> 00:35:41.344
it may have been necessary to
find and impose restraints on

00:35:41.344 --> 00:35:45.510
the passions of the demos but in
the modern world,

00:35:45.510 --> 00:35:48.548
he says, where republics have
become a thing of the past,

00:35:48.548 --> 00:35:51.804
the people need to be taught
how to value their liberty above

00:35:51.804 --> 00:35:54.455
all else.
The most excellent princes of

00:35:54.455 --> 00:35:57.340
the past were those like Moses,
he tells us,

00:35:57.340 --> 00:36:00.561
who brought tables of law and
prepared people for

00:36:00.561 --> 00:36:03.523
self-government.
It is fitting and proper that

00:36:03.523 --> 00:36:06.039
The Prince concludes,
the last chapter,

00:36:06.039 --> 00:36:10.675
chapter 26, concludes with a
patriotic call to his countrymen

00:36:10.675 --> 00:36:14.925
to emancipate themselves and
liberate Italy from foreign

00:36:14.925 --> 00:36:15.930
invaders.

00:36:19.940 --> 00:36:24.019
So what did Machiavelli achieve?
What were his actual

00:36:24.019 --> 00:36:24.920
accomplishments?

00:36:28.460 --> 00:36:33.287
Did he accomplish all he set
out to do, to rewrite or to

00:36:33.287 --> 00:36:37.150
write a new moral code for
political life,

00:36:37.150 --> 00:36:42.971
to found a new political
continent, as he speaks about,

00:36:42.971 --> 00:36:49.440
to found new modes and orders
along the lines of Columbus?

00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:52.254
Did he achieve this?
First of all,

00:36:52.254 --> 00:36:57.613
one should not and cannot
underestimate his unprecedented

00:36:57.613 --> 00:37:02.590
break with both classical and
biblical antiquity.

00:37:02.590 --> 00:37:06.732
More than anyone else before
him, and perhaps more than

00:37:06.732 --> 00:37:10.415
anyone else since,
he sought to liberate politics

00:37:10.415 --> 00:37:14.374
from ecclesiastical control.
The new prince,

00:37:14.374 --> 00:37:18.685
as we've seen,
must know how to use religion

00:37:18.685 --> 00:37:24.000
but needs to learn how not to be
used by religion,

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:27.199
must not become a dupe of the
religious.

00:37:27.199 --> 00:37:30.767
He must know how to use
religious passions and

00:37:30.767 --> 00:37:33.699
sentiments but not be used by
them.

00:37:33.699 --> 00:37:37.500
Politics must become a purely
worldly affair.

00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:41.868
It should not be limited or
constrained by any transcendent

00:37:41.868 --> 00:37:46.840
standards or moral laws that do
not derive from politics itself,

00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:53.002
whether a law of God or some
kind of transcendent moral order

00:37:53.002 --> 00:37:54.030
or code.

00:37:57.760 --> 00:38:01.117
Machiavelli's warning,
we might say today,

00:38:01.117 --> 00:38:04.802
to the religious right,
or his critique of the

00:38:04.802 --> 00:38:10.312
religious right,
cannot make politics conform to

00:38:10.312 --> 00:38:15.479
transcendent moral law.
But not only did Machiavelli

00:38:15.479 --> 00:38:19.818
bring a new worldliness to
politics, he also introduced a

00:38:19.818 --> 00:38:22.840
new kind of populism,
you might say.

00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:27.552
Plato and Aristotle imagined
aristocratic republics that

00:38:27.552 --> 00:38:32.007
would invest power in an
aristocracy of education and

00:38:32.007 --> 00:38:35.544
virtue.
Machiavelli deliberately seeks

00:38:35.544 --> 00:38:40.474
to enlist the power of the
people against aristocracies of

00:38:40.474 --> 00:38:44.618
education and virtue.
He is a kind of proto-democrat

00:38:44.618 --> 00:38:48.410
almost who sought to re-create,
not through accident and

00:38:48.410 --> 00:38:52.063
chance,
but through planning and design

00:38:52.063 --> 00:38:56.269
a new kind of republic in the
modern world.

00:38:56.269 --> 00:39:00.702
The republic that Machiavelli
imagined, and it's interesting

00:39:00.702 --> 00:39:05.059
while he tells us he's only
going to the effectual truth of

00:39:05.059 --> 00:39:08.139
things and not the imagination
of it,

00:39:08.139 --> 00:39:12.786
nevertheless Machiavelli does
himself imagine a new kind of

00:39:12.786 --> 00:39:17.593
regime, a new kind of republic
in the modern world that would

00:39:17.593 --> 00:39:21.920
not be a city at peace but would
be a city at war.

00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:28.324
It would be armed and expansive.
Machiavelli's republic feeds on

00:39:28.324 --> 00:39:34.648
conflict, on war and conquest.
It is aggressive and

00:39:34.648 --> 00:39:39.920
imperialistic.
Does it sound familiar?

00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:45.568
Is it us?
In fact, if you look at a

00:39:45.568 --> 00:39:50.119
brilliant article I think in
this week's New Republic

00:39:50.119 --> 00:39:53.360
by Robert Kagan called "Cowboy
Nation,"

00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:59.162
Kagan demonstrates I think with
a great deal of conviction that

00:39:59.162 --> 00:40:04.590
the American republic from its
onset has been expansive,

00:40:04.590 --> 00:40:08.361
aggressive, imperialistic,
from the conquest of the

00:40:08.361 --> 00:40:12.659
territories, the expropriation
of the native Americans,

00:40:12.659 --> 00:40:17.976
the acquisition of Louisiana,
wars of liberation against

00:40:17.976 --> 00:40:23.035
Mexico and Spain and so on,
well into the twentieth and now

00:40:23.035 --> 00:40:25.873
the twenty first century,
an aggressive,

00:40:25.873 --> 00:40:29.070
expansive,
imperialistic republic.

00:40:29.070 --> 00:40:32.262
That, he says,
has been our history and what

00:40:32.262 --> 00:40:35.307
it should say,
what it doesn't quite say I

00:40:35.307 --> 00:40:38.013
think,
is that it has been this

00:40:38.013 --> 00:40:42.348
history not because it is
American but because it is a

00:40:42.348 --> 00:40:45.897
republic,
because of its regime type,

00:40:45.897 --> 00:40:49.952
its regime character.
That kind of behavior seems

00:40:49.952 --> 00:40:53.659
perhaps to be built in to the
natures of republic.

00:40:53.659 --> 00:40:57.272
It was Machiavelli's admiration
for the politics,

00:40:57.272 --> 00:41:00.809
what someone once called the
lupine politics,

00:41:00.809 --> 00:41:06.367
the wolf-like politics,
of republican Rome that led him

00:41:06.367 --> 00:41:11.925
to understand that all social
and moral goods have been

00:41:11.925 --> 00:41:16.659
established by morally
questionable means.

00:41:16.659 --> 00:41:22.039
Have we become or have we
always been Machiavelli's

00:41:22.039 --> 00:41:28.201
republic, Machiavelli's desire?
Think about that when you're in

00:41:28.201 --> 00:41:33.086
your sections or writing your
papers and you will get those

00:41:33.086 --> 00:41:36.539
paper topics on Wednesday,
by the way.

00:41:36.539 --> 00:41:42.719
And finally,
Machiavelli is the author of a

00:41:42.719 --> 00:41:48.183
new amoral realism.
"By whatever means necessary" I

00:41:48.183 --> 00:41:52.777
think is his motto or should be
his motto, "by whatever means

00:41:52.777 --> 00:41:55.765
necessary,"
and oddly he claims to be

00:41:55.765 --> 00:41:59.827
merely stating out loud,
merely stating aloud what all

00:41:59.827 --> 00:42:02.280
writers have known all along.

00:42:06.210 --> 00:42:09.950
It is necessary,
he says, for the prince to know

00:42:09.950 --> 00:42:14.010
well how to use the beast and
the man, he writes.

00:42:14.010 --> 00:42:17.146
"This role," he says,
"was taught covertly by ancient

00:42:17.146 --> 00:42:19.886
writers.
It was taught covertly by

00:42:19.886 --> 00:42:23.389
ancient writers," he says in
chapter 18.

00:42:23.389 --> 00:42:27.418
The idea then that Machiavelli
is doing no more than saying

00:42:27.418 --> 00:42:31.654
openly and overtly what ancient
writers had wrapped in parable

00:42:31.654 --> 00:42:35.335
and enigma and myth says
something about Machiavelli's

00:42:35.335 --> 00:42:40.257
new political science.
What was previously taught only

00:42:40.257 --> 00:42:46.309
subtly and in private will now
be taught openly and in public.

00:42:46.309 --> 00:42:50.777
What was once available only to
a few, will now be available to

00:42:50.777 --> 00:42:53.173
all.
Perhaps more than anything

00:42:53.173 --> 00:42:56.873
else, Machiavelli's new
openness, his readiness to

00:42:56.873 --> 00:43:01.413
challenge received authority,
and his willingness to consider

00:43:01.413 --> 00:43:04.837
authority as self-created,
as self-made rather than

00:43:04.837 --> 00:43:07.440
bestowed by either nature or
grace,

00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:12.670
is what fundamentally
constitutes his modernity.

00:43:12.670 --> 00:43:16.905
So I'm going to leave it on
that note and on Wednesday we

00:43:16.905 --> 00:43:21.518
will begin the study of one of
Machiavelli's greatest and most

00:43:21.518 --> 00:43:24.769
profound disciples in the modern
world,

00:43:24.769 --> 00:43:28.000
a man by the name of Thomas
Hobbes.

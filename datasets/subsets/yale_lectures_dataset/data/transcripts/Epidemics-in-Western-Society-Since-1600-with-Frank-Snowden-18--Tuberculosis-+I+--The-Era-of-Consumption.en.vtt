00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:03.620
Prof: Good morning.
 

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:08.119
Our topic for this time,
and next, is another of the

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:13.680
really ancient diseases in our
course, which is tuberculosis.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.460
Tuberculosis was present in
Ancient Egypt.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:24.030
This is known from skeletons
and from mummies.

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:28.590
And it seems that tuberculosis
has been with human beings ever

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.300
since they first began to gather
in substantial settlements,

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.910
which are essential for its
transmission,

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.240
in ways we'll be discussing.
 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.410
It was present in Ancient
Greece, and in Rome,

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:47.600
and Hippocrates and Galen
clearly knew patients suffering

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.640
from tuberculosis.
 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.250
It persisted in the Middle Ages.
 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:57.460
So, we're dealing not with a
new but a very ancient disease.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.465
A question that you'll be
asking is whether indeed it's an

00:01:01.465 --> 00:01:05.623
epidemic disease;
would it perhaps be better to

00:01:05.623 --> 00:01:07.959
describe it as endemic?
 

00:01:07.959 --> 00:01:10.980
And this again,
I think, as when we dealt with

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.968
malaria,
we see that some diseases are

00:01:13.968 --> 00:01:18.393
both endemic and epidemic,
and I think this applies to

00:01:18.393 --> 00:01:20.230
tuberculosis as well.
 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:26.090
One way of thinking of it might
be in terms of its time frame.

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.373
If you look at any single
generation, it often seems that

00:01:30.373 --> 00:01:33.510
tuberculosis isn't an epidemic
disease.

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.390
It's present,
after all, year after year.

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:42.730
It is contagious but it spreads
slowly from person to person.

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:48.200
Its course in the individual
body of a patient is often very

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.239
slow and capricious.
 

00:01:50.239 --> 00:01:54.510
It's clearly different from
bubonic plague,

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:58.170
from influenza or Asiatic
cholera.

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.215
But if you take a long-term
perspective, it might seem that

00:02:03.215 --> 00:02:08.348
tuberculosis does ebb and flow,
like an epidemic disease.

00:02:08.348 --> 00:02:12.652
Perhaps one could think of it
in terms of an epidemic that

00:02:12.652 --> 00:02:17.508
lasts for centuries,
perhaps, or decades in the case

00:02:17.508 --> 00:02:22.938
of a body of a single patient,
at times.

00:02:22.938 --> 00:02:27.579
In a sense, one could say that
tuberculosis could be an

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:30.500
epidemic disease in slow motion.
 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:36.110
Our concern will be with Europe
and North America,

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.455
at a time of a vast
upsurge--and here I'm referring

00:02:40.455 --> 00:02:44.435
to Western Europe--
that coincided with the

00:02:44.435 --> 00:02:46.590
Industrial Revolution.
 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.686
Here there are a number of
factors that lie in the

00:02:50.686 --> 00:02:54.030
background that contributed,
probably.

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:59.680
One is a large-scale pace of
urbanization,

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.349
and we'll see the impact of
crowded housing and poor

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:06.301
ventilation,
which are decisive factors,

00:03:06.301 --> 00:03:10.116
particularly in the case of a
disease that's a pulmonary

00:03:10.116 --> 00:03:13.139
disease,
above all.

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:17.665
The rise of sweatshops and the
factory system again led to

00:03:17.665 --> 00:03:20.734
crowding,
this time not in the home but

00:03:20.734 --> 00:03:24.675
in the workplace,
and poor ventilation now during

00:03:24.675 --> 00:03:28.620
the day,
as well as in the home at night.

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.941
I'm thinking of low wages,
and with that poor diet and a

00:03:33.941 --> 00:03:36.650
compromised immune system.
 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.342
Another factor that's very
important for diseases that are

00:03:41.342 --> 00:03:45.128
respiratory is pollution of the
atmosphere,

00:03:45.128 --> 00:03:49.670
and the smog in cities like
London due to soot from the

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:53.705
burning of coal,
or particles due to tobacco

00:03:53.705 --> 00:03:56.675
from smoking,
or again particles in

00:03:56.675 --> 00:03:59.599
mineshafts, or unhygienic
workshops,

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:03.000
all made their contribution.
 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.403
In any case,
it's not by chance that

00:04:05.403 --> 00:04:08.334
England,
the first industrial nation,

00:04:08.334 --> 00:04:12.914
experienced an epidemic wave
that crested between the middle

00:04:12.914 --> 00:04:17.730
of the eighteenth century and
the middle of the nineteenth.

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:21.999
And then in the case of
England, there was a slow,

00:04:21.999 --> 00:04:26.704
steady decline from the later
decades of the nineteenth

00:04:26.704 --> 00:04:27.750
century.
 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.937
And we can see this as well
taking place in countries that

00:04:31.937 --> 00:04:35.245
industrialized a little bit
later, say France,

00:04:35.245 --> 00:04:37.230
Germany, Italy,
Russia.

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:43.100
The upsurge began later,
but did so remorselessly.

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:47.216
And then a decline set in,
but again slightly later,

00:04:47.216 --> 00:04:50.930
from the beginning of the
twentieth century.

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:55.810
If you look at the geography of
tuberculosis in Europe,

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:00.843
it would also support this idea
of a clear relationship between

00:05:00.843 --> 00:05:05.915
tuberculosis as a condition,
and the conditions created by

00:05:05.915 --> 00:05:10.781
industrial development;
especially in its traumatic

00:05:10.781 --> 00:05:12.209
early phases.
 

00:05:12.209 --> 00:05:17.129
Tuberculosis was a major killer
in the northern industrial

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:19.730
nations--
Britain, Germany and

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:24.269
France--and it was less
prevalent in less industrial,

00:05:24.269 --> 00:05:29.139
largely agricultural nations,
such as Italy and Spain.

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:32.649
So, there's this distinction to
be made.

00:05:32.649 --> 00:05:37.480
But also if you looked at the
pattern of tuberculosis in Italy

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:41.389
and Spain,
you would see not only was it

00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:44.726
less there,
but also it respected the

00:05:44.726 --> 00:05:48.000
distribution of industrial
development.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.490
Take Italy for example.
 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:52.855
We already talked,
in the case of malaria,

00:05:52.855 --> 00:05:55.730
about a major north/south
divide.

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:59.074
This is also true with regard
to tuberculosis,

00:05:59.074 --> 00:06:00.338
but in reverse.
 

00:06:00.338 --> 00:06:02.706
Tuberculosis,
in other words,

00:06:02.706 --> 00:06:07.610
was an affliction above all of
Italy's northern cities,

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:13.567
and it was much less prevalent
in the agricultural south where

00:06:13.567 --> 00:06:16.009
people worked outdoors.
 

00:06:16.009 --> 00:06:20.278
Well, let's turn now to the
nature of the disease:

00:06:20.278 --> 00:06:23.851
how it's transmitted,
its different forms,

00:06:23.851 --> 00:06:27.250
and its symptomatology in the
body.

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:29.757
The pathogen,
to begin with,

00:06:29.757 --> 00:06:34.589
was first discovered by someone
we know well now,

00:06:34.589 --> 00:06:39.490
in a variety of contexts,
and this is Robert Koch,

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:44.285
who discovered it in 1882--the
Mycobacterium

00:06:44.285 --> 00:06:51.610
tuberculosis,
which is that.

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:57.055
Now, transmission--tuberculosis
can be spread in more than one

00:06:57.055 --> 00:06:58.711
way,
but we're concerned,

00:06:58.711 --> 00:07:01.910
and will be concerned,
primarily with its dominant

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:05.769
mode of transmission,
which is through the air.

00:07:05.769 --> 00:07:11.721
In other words,
a sufferer from tuberculosis

00:07:11.721 --> 00:07:15.598
will say cough,
sneeze, spit,

00:07:15.598 --> 00:07:24.180
and give off airborne droplets,
which are then inhaled by other

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:25.980
people.
 

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:32.071
Now, a primary infection by
most people who come into

00:07:32.071 --> 00:07:39.216
contact with Mycobacterium
tuberculosis doesn't lead on

00:07:39.216 --> 00:07:43.199
to symptoms, it usually heals.
 

00:07:43.199 --> 00:07:47.091
But in those with compromised
immune systems,

00:07:47.091 --> 00:07:50.100
the disease,
as the expression was,

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:51.870
is disseminated.
 

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:54.610
It can then lie dormant for
years.

00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:58.704
As I've said,
one of the things about

00:07:58.704 --> 00:08:04.620
tuberculosis is its enormously
capricious quality.

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:08.716
Alternatively,
it could produce disease within

00:08:08.716 --> 00:08:11.720
weeks of the primary infection.
 

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:15.721
Mycobacterium
tuberculosis can spread via

00:08:15.721 --> 00:08:18.966
the bloodstream,
or the lymph system,

00:08:18.966 --> 00:08:23.612
to infect a variety of organs,
and produce lesions in

00:08:23.612 --> 00:08:26.769
virtually any tissue in the
body.

00:08:26.769 --> 00:08:32.254
I'll show you now a number of
images of sufferers from

00:08:32.254 --> 00:08:35.668
tuberculosis,
in various forms.

00:08:35.668 --> 00:08:39.144
And I'm hoping that these
images won't be overly

00:08:39.144 --> 00:08:40.918
distressing to anyone.
 

00:08:40.918 --> 00:08:45.513
First, this is scrofula,
sometimes called the

00:08:45.513 --> 00:08:50.419
"King's Evil,"
which was--here we have

00:08:50.419 --> 00:08:53.029
scrofula of the neck.
 

00:08:53.029 --> 00:08:58.804
There's tuberculosis of the
skin, called Lupus

00:08:58.804 --> 00:09:00.610
vulgaris.
 

00:09:00.610 --> 00:09:04.470
Tuberculosis can also infect
the meninges of the brain,

00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:06.573
the bone and joints,
the kidneys,

00:09:06.573 --> 00:09:09.139
the urinary and reproductive
system,

00:09:09.139 --> 00:09:14.114
and can infect the spine,
leading to severe deformity and

00:09:14.114 --> 00:09:15.179
hunchback.
 

00:09:15.179 --> 00:09:19.308
I'll show you then that form;
it's called Pott's Disease.

00:09:19.308 --> 00:09:24.490
And there's a skeleton from a
sufferer of Pott's Disease--or

00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:28.178
this is what be what it would
look like.

00:09:28.178 --> 00:09:33.581
The disease can also affect the
lining of the abdominal cavity

00:09:33.581 --> 00:09:34.908
or the heart.
 

00:09:34.908 --> 00:09:39.419
But overwhelmingly,
the most common form of

00:09:39.419 --> 00:09:42.750
tuberculosis is of the lungs.
 

00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:47.404
And this is what we'll be
dealing with primarily in the

00:09:47.404 --> 00:09:51.799
course, pulmonary disease,
also known as phthisis or

00:09:51.799 --> 00:09:53.178
consumption.
 

00:09:53.178 --> 00:09:59.572
We'll mention in passing that
tuberculosis is also spread,

00:09:59.572 --> 00:10:04.283
and was spread,
by meat or milk of infected

00:10:04.283 --> 00:10:08.797
animals;
but that's a secondary tragedy

00:10:08.797 --> 00:10:14.918
within the larger dominant
pulmonary form of the disease.

00:10:14.918 --> 00:10:18.298
Now, you know from your reading
response questions,

00:10:18.298 --> 00:10:23.413
and from Barnes' book this
week, that tuberculosis is

00:10:23.413 --> 00:10:27.840
sometimes referred to as a
social disease,

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:33.375
and you'll see in your in trays
that I've just sent you an email

00:10:33.375 --> 00:10:38.210
about social diseases and how we
might think of them.

00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:42.351
But just for the moment,
you'll note that Barnes doesn't

00:10:42.351 --> 00:10:45.440
define what he means by social
disease.

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:52.360
By saying that it was a social
disease,

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:59.113
he's arguing that tuberculosis
had a predilection for certain

00:10:59.113 --> 00:11:04.663
social classes,
that it was a disease that was

00:11:04.663 --> 00:11:08.403
unlike--
that it didn't affect all

00:11:08.403 --> 00:11:10.230
classes equally.
 

00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:13.953
Now, note that cholera,
for example,

00:11:13.953 --> 00:11:19.700
was a disease that didn't
affect all social classes.

00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:22.445
Tuberculosis did,
in fact, afflict royal

00:11:22.445 --> 00:11:24.496
families,
aristocrats,

00:11:24.496 --> 00:11:28.220
artists, writers and
professionals,

00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:32.466
and this was an important
factor in the social response to

00:11:32.466 --> 00:11:33.509
the disease.
 

00:11:33.509 --> 00:11:38.145
Given the mode of transmission,
that is, through the air,

00:11:38.145 --> 00:11:42.120
it was inevitable that that
would be the case.

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:46.365
So, even if we do decide to
call tuberculosis a social

00:11:46.365 --> 00:11:50.210
disease, we need to make major
qualifications.

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:54.445
But to focus on the rich and
famous is distorting,

00:11:54.445 --> 00:11:58.506
because out of all proportion,
tuberculosis did,

00:11:58.506 --> 00:12:04.528
and still, afflicts the poor;
especially the urban poor.

00:12:04.528 --> 00:12:08.682
Remember the risk factors we
said: living in cities rather

00:12:08.682 --> 00:12:13.769
than the countryside;
crowded, unhygienic housing;

00:12:13.769 --> 00:12:17.994
poor ventilation;
workplaces that were similar to

00:12:17.994 --> 00:12:21.889
those of the home;
child labor en masse;

00:12:21.889 --> 00:12:27.840
lowered resistance due to poor
diet or pre-existing diseases.

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:33.479
Tuberculosis then thrived in
slums and tenements,

00:12:33.479 --> 00:12:39.235
among industrial workers,
and among the inmates of

00:12:39.235 --> 00:12:43.230
almshouses, prisons,
barracks.

00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:45.971
Let me give you some
illustrations,

00:12:45.971 --> 00:12:49.279
and we'll look at some famous
pictures.

00:12:49.279 --> 00:12:55.023
I think that we have no better
ones than the photographs taken

00:12:55.023 --> 00:13:00.673
by Jacob Riis of tenements and
sweatshops in New York City in

00:13:00.673 --> 00:13:05.285
the 1880s and nineties,
some of which were collected in

00:13:05.285 --> 00:13:07.899
his really famous and
influential book,

00:13:07.899 --> 00:13:11.626
How the Other Half
Lives, that was published in

00:13:11.626 --> 00:13:12.120
1890.
 

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:15.899
And I'd like to show you some
of the pictures.

00:13:15.899 --> 00:13:21.879
This is a slide of a tenement,
an ideal place for

00:13:21.879 --> 00:13:23.750
tuberculosis.
 

00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:27.100
We'll be looking first at some
pictures of housing,

00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:31.118
and I'd like you just to make
the imaginative leap of thinking

00:13:31.118 --> 00:13:33.490
what are the kinds of
conditions,

00:13:33.490 --> 00:13:38.422
if you live in these places,
that facilitate the spread of

00:13:38.422 --> 00:13:39.720
tuberculosis?
 

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:48.870
Again, this is from Jacob Riis,
a tenement in New York City.

00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:57.000
Here we see the conditions in
which people were sleeping.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:02.264
This is what was called
seven-cent lodgings in an

00:14:02.264 --> 00:14:05.225
unhappy street,
Pell Street,

00:14:05.225 --> 00:14:07.528
in New York City.
 

00:14:07.528 --> 00:14:12.129
And you can see how
tuberculosis would thrive in

00:14:12.129 --> 00:14:14.379
conditions like this.
 

00:14:14.379 --> 00:14:19.067
But let's also remember that
tuberculosis also thrived

00:14:19.067 --> 00:14:21.899
because of conditions at work.
 

00:14:21.899 --> 00:14:26.663
And here's a sweatshop in the
Garment District in New York

00:14:26.663 --> 00:14:28.919
City, again in the 1890s.
 

00:14:28.919 --> 00:14:32.740
Or here again another picture.
 

00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:35.460
I think you get the point.
 

00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:38.750
Remember too that prison
populations,

00:14:38.750 --> 00:14:43.024
then and now,
have been seriously affected

00:14:43.024 --> 00:14:47.312
with consumption,
because the inmates there have

00:14:47.312 --> 00:14:51.129
often lived in conditions like
those of tenements,

00:14:51.129 --> 00:14:55.070
with poor ventilation or
lighting, pervasive damp,

00:14:55.070 --> 00:14:57.876
overcrowding,
inadequate diet,

00:14:57.876 --> 00:14:59.620
poor sanitation.
 

00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:04.519
In conditions like that,
tuberculosis runs riot.

00:15:04.519 --> 00:15:08.658
Indeed, the New York
Times reported,

00:15:08.658 --> 00:15:14.275
in 1908, that it was a lie when
judges sentenced convicted

00:15:14.275 --> 00:15:16.740
felons to hard labor.
 

00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:22.037
The truth, the paper reported,
was that the sentence should be

00:15:22.037 --> 00:15:26.639
labeled "to hard labor and
tuberculosis."

00:15:26.639 --> 00:15:30.120
In an inspection in 1905,
the New York State

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:34.572
Superintendent of Prisons
declared that Sing Sing Prison

00:15:34.572 --> 00:15:38.062
in particular--
and here I'm quoting from the

00:15:38.062 --> 00:15:41.158
Superintendent of Prisons of New
York State--

00:15:41.158 --> 00:15:45.538
he called it "a hotbed for
the culture and spread of

00:15:45.538 --> 00:15:49.476
tuberculosis,
that should be abandoned as

00:15:49.476 --> 00:15:52.860
unfit for human
habitation."

00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:57.080
Well, even if a person is
infected, as I said,

00:15:57.080 --> 00:16:02.615
in the vast majority of people
the immune system of the body

00:16:02.615 --> 00:16:04.960
contains the disease.
 

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:09.658
In the nineteenth century,
say in Paris or Le Havre,

00:16:09.658 --> 00:16:14.301
probably New York City as well,
it's estimated that virtually

00:16:14.301 --> 00:16:18.014
every inhabitant had encountered
Mycobacterium

00:16:18.014 --> 00:16:22.946
tuberculosis;
but most remained asymptomatic

00:16:22.946 --> 00:16:25.149
and non-infectious.
 

00:16:25.149 --> 00:16:31.173
An active infection was
promoted by a compromised immune

00:16:31.173 --> 00:16:34.525
system;
let's say perhaps heredity,

00:16:34.525 --> 00:16:39.082
alcoholism, malnutrition,
drug abuse, the presence of

00:16:39.082 --> 00:16:43.639
concurrent infections that are
immunosuppressive.

00:16:43.639 --> 00:16:48.142
In our own times,
one can think of malaria,

00:16:48.142 --> 00:16:53.287
AIDS or diabetes as forming a
good substratum for

00:16:53.287 --> 00:16:55.110
tuberculosis.
 

00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:58.370
What are the symptoms of TB?
 

00:16:58.370 --> 00:17:01.288
Well, it's extremely variable.
 

00:17:01.288 --> 00:17:04.457
One of the mysteries of
medicine, in fact,

00:17:04.457 --> 00:17:08.318
is the course of tuberculosis
in the human body.

00:17:08.318 --> 00:17:12.480
It can be fulminant and lead to
death in months.

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:17.755
This is often called galloping
consumption, at the time,

00:17:17.755 --> 00:17:20.250
or miliary tuberculosis.
 

00:17:20.250 --> 00:17:23.250
Alternatively,
there can be an onset of

00:17:23.250 --> 00:17:26.406
symptoms,
followed by recovery or

00:17:26.406 --> 00:17:31.650
remission, and then a relapse,
and instead of leading to early

00:17:31.650 --> 00:17:34.205
death,
it can lead to a long,

00:17:34.205 --> 00:17:38.894
chronic illness,
often punctuated by prolonged

00:17:38.894 --> 00:17:43.529
remissions and equally
mysterious relapses.

00:17:43.529 --> 00:17:48.656
Before the age of antibiotics,
some eighty-percent of cases

00:17:48.656 --> 00:17:54.509
were deemed to end fatally,
but in a time span that varied

00:17:54.509 --> 00:17:58.740
from up to fifteen,
twenty years.

00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:03.420
And in every age there were
spontaneous cures,

00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:05.500
or apparent cures.
 

00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:09.935
Let's look at two opposite
extremes, two famous cases,

00:18:09.935 --> 00:18:14.204
the medical careers of two
famous nineteenth-century

00:18:14.204 --> 00:18:15.880
British writers.
 

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:22.884
The first is John Keats,
who lived from 1795 until his

00:18:22.884 --> 00:18:27.380
death from tuberculosis in 1821.
 

00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:32.084
Note 1821;
because he fell ill in February

00:18:32.084 --> 00:18:36.934
1820, and died the next year,
at the age of twenty-six,

00:18:36.934 --> 00:18:39.630
from galloping consumption.
 

00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:43.082
Keats, in fact,
became an icon of the

00:18:43.082 --> 00:18:48.548
relationship of tuberculosis to
the arts and to genius.

00:18:48.548 --> 00:18:54.181
An entire century was familiar
with the fact that he contracted

00:18:54.181 --> 00:18:58.358
the disease while tending his
dying brother;

00:18:58.358 --> 00:19:03.368
that he made a desperate
departure from Britain to Rome

00:19:03.368 --> 00:19:06.353
in search of health;
and it knows,

00:19:06.353 --> 00:19:09.474
the world knew,
at the time of his death and

00:19:09.474 --> 00:19:13.165
burial there,
after a final period that was

00:19:13.165 --> 00:19:18.077
widely and romantically regarded
as his most productive and

00:19:18.077 --> 00:19:19.180
brilliant.
 

00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:24.541
His life was described by
romantic writers as that of a

00:19:24.541 --> 00:19:29.210
meteor, a comet,
or a candle that rapidly burned

00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:30.700
itself out.
 

00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:35.328
And this became a focal
point--and Keats himself did--

00:19:35.328 --> 00:19:39.211
for the way this disease was
construed or socially

00:19:39.211 --> 00:19:44.201
constructed in the middle of the
nineteenth century as a disease

00:19:44.201 --> 00:19:45.308
of genius.
 

00:19:45.308 --> 00:19:50.432
It was considered to be a
disease of sensibility and

00:19:50.432 --> 00:19:51.940
civilization.
 

00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:55.790
Let's look at the disease of a
different person,

00:19:55.790 --> 00:19:57.838
whom you all know well.
 

00:19:57.838 --> 00:20:05.500
This is Robert Louis Stevenson,
who lived from 1850 to 1894.

00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:09.490
This is a picture of him in
about 1890.

00:20:09.490 --> 00:20:14.686
Stevenson, unlike Keats,
battled tuberculosis for

00:20:14.686 --> 00:20:15.769
decades.
 

00:20:15.769 --> 00:20:20.538
He went in and out of health
spas and sanatoriums.

00:20:20.538 --> 00:20:25.093
But he led a long and
productive life that was ended,

00:20:25.093 --> 00:20:28.769
in fact ironically,
not by tuberculosis but

00:20:28.769 --> 00:20:30.960
probably by a stroke.
 

00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:36.472
Now, in the nineteenth century,
physicians regarded the course

00:20:36.472 --> 00:20:41.172
of pulmonary disease as passing
through three stages,

00:20:41.172 --> 00:20:42.890
as they saw it.
 

00:20:42.890 --> 00:20:47.520
But remember though,
before the tuberculin skin test

00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:50.788
and the development of
radiology,

00:20:50.788 --> 00:20:55.210
tuberculosis was difficult to
diagnose,

00:20:55.210 --> 00:21:00.788
as the symptoms mimicked those
of other common diseases.

00:21:00.788 --> 00:21:05.497
And even if the diagnosis was
accurate, one stage merged

00:21:05.497 --> 00:21:07.980
imperceptibly into another.
 

00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:11.434
But for nineteenth century
physicians, there was still this

00:21:11.434 --> 00:21:12.269
distinction.
 

00:21:12.269 --> 00:21:15.702
The first stage,
as they described it,

00:21:15.702 --> 00:21:20.434
was marked by a persistent
cough, some difficulty in

00:21:20.434 --> 00:21:24.240
breathing, especially after
exercise.

00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:27.548
The patient would sweat
profusely.

00:21:27.548 --> 00:21:32.256
There would be an elevated
pulse, pain in the chest and

00:21:32.256 --> 00:21:34.926
shoulders,
general lassitude,

00:21:34.926 --> 00:21:39.994
a loss of weight,
pallor, declining performance

00:21:39.994 --> 00:21:42.608
at work or at school.
 

00:21:42.608 --> 00:21:47.506
Then came a second stage when
the cough became tormenting and

00:21:47.506 --> 00:21:52.321
frequent, and the patient would
begin to cough up a greenish

00:21:52.321 --> 00:21:53.220
phlegm.
 

00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:57.291
He or she would experience
intermittent fevers,

00:21:57.291 --> 00:22:01.452
spiking twice daily,
with copious sweating and a

00:22:01.452 --> 00:22:02.868
rapid pulse.
 

00:22:02.868 --> 00:22:06.771
The patient would suffer from
severe fatigability,

00:22:06.771 --> 00:22:11.470
from hoarseness that made it
difficult and painful to eat or

00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:13.778
to speak above a whisper.
 

00:22:13.778 --> 00:22:18.769
There would be extreme
shortness of breath on exertion,

00:22:18.769 --> 00:22:21.818
pain in the joints of the body.
 

00:22:21.818 --> 00:22:26.387
Then came the third stage of
advanced tuberculosis,

00:22:26.387 --> 00:22:31.505
which gave the most common
nineteenth-century name to the

00:22:31.505 --> 00:22:35.931
disease: consumption;
that is, a frightening

00:22:35.931 --> 00:22:41.382
emaciation in which the body
wasted away, or seemed to be

00:22:41.382 --> 00:22:42.548
consumed.
 

00:22:42.548 --> 00:22:45.980
The face would be hollow,
the complexion pale.

00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:50.278
Perhaps this was one of the
reasons that it was called the

00:22:50.278 --> 00:22:51.410
white plague.
 

00:22:51.410 --> 00:22:54.554
The eyes would be sunken in
their sockets,

00:22:54.554 --> 00:22:57.930
and a patient could easily look
like this.

00:22:57.930 --> 00:23:03.430
This is a picture of a
consumptive patient in 1892.

00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:06.672
The cough now seemed like a
death rattle,

00:23:06.672 --> 00:23:09.588
and the patient would cough
blood.

00:23:09.588 --> 00:23:12.859
There would be constant pain in
the joints.

00:23:12.859 --> 00:23:14.710
The legs would be swollen.
 

00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:18.608
There would be fever,
often uncontrollable diarrhea,

00:23:18.608 --> 00:23:21.210
and extreme shortness of
breath.

00:23:21.210 --> 00:23:25.078
At that point,
the diagnosis was certain.

00:23:25.078 --> 00:23:28.798
But at this advanced stage
death was imminent,

00:23:28.798 --> 00:23:32.269
and its form was unpleasant and
painful;

00:23:32.269 --> 00:23:35.784
often asphyxia,
as the patient virtually

00:23:35.784 --> 00:23:39.750
drowned on the phlegm in his or
her lungs.

00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:43.799
Or there could be a sudden and
unstoppable hemorrhage,

00:23:43.799 --> 00:23:47.315
with blood rushing from the
mouth and nostrils,

00:23:47.315 --> 00:23:50.220
and the patient again
suffocating.

00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:53.460
Well, what was it that happened
to the lungs?

00:23:53.460 --> 00:24:00.769
Here's a modern x-ray slide of
a TB patient's lungs.

00:24:00.769 --> 00:24:07.430
And let's look behind the x-ray
at pictures of the lungs.

00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:15.150
Here is a set of healthy lungs,
hopefully like all of yours.

00:24:15.150 --> 00:24:18.973
And then I'd like to take you
through the drawings and

00:24:18.973 --> 00:24:23.160
pictures of the process called
cavitation in the lungs,

00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:27.260
and the way in which the
Mycobacterium

00:24:27.260 --> 00:24:32.490
tuberculosis consumes the
respiratory organs.

00:24:32.490 --> 00:24:35.450
This is a famous drawing by
Ren� Laennec,

00:24:35.450 --> 00:24:38.460
you know of the Paris School of
Medicine,

00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:42.637
who was a tuberculosis
authority, and he did this

00:24:42.637 --> 00:24:47.339
drawing of the onset of the
cavitation in the lungs.

00:24:47.339 --> 00:24:55.740
Let's look at a picture of it.
 

00:24:55.740 --> 00:25:00.680
This is the process of necrosis
at work in the tissues,

00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:04.868
and the end result would be the
destruction of the lungs,

00:25:04.868 --> 00:25:10.140
which would look more or less
like that.

00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:17.627
So, this was an enormously
painful, horrible and unpleasant

00:25:17.627 --> 00:25:18.920
disease.
 

00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:24.049
And I want to argue that there
are two great eras in the modern

00:25:24.049 --> 00:25:29.016
history of tuberculosis in which
the disease was conceived or

00:25:29.016 --> 00:25:35.065
thought of quite differently,
and without much relationship

00:25:35.065 --> 00:25:40.308
to the reality of the quality of
the symptoms.

00:25:40.308 --> 00:25:45.131
The two periods are divided by
the watershed of the germ theory

00:25:45.131 --> 00:25:49.452
of disease,
established by Robert Koch from

00:25:49.452 --> 00:25:52.519
about 1882,
and slowly then accepted

00:25:52.519 --> 00:25:55.299
thereafter by the medical
profession,

00:25:55.299 --> 00:25:58.954
and educated society as a whole;
not instantly,

00:25:58.954 --> 00:26:01.940
but in the decades that follow.
 

00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:06.490
I'd like to call the first era
the era of consumption,

00:26:06.490 --> 00:26:10.440
or perhaps the romantic era of
tuberculosis.

00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:15.380
Let's define it from the end of
the eighteenth century to the

00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:19.910
middle, to about the time of
Robert Koch's discovery.

00:26:19.910 --> 00:26:25.440
It was jolted first by,
in the 1860s and '70s,

00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:28.150
by the work of Jean-Antoine
Villemin,

00:26:28.150 --> 00:26:33.395
in France, who first
convincingly proposed the idea

00:26:33.395 --> 00:26:36.019
that TB was contagious.
 

00:26:36.019 --> 00:26:41.009
And then the romantic era
clearly came to an end with the

00:26:41.009 --> 00:26:45.361
work of Robert Koch,
when society accepts this new

00:26:45.361 --> 00:26:50.224
interpretation,
and the word consumption begins

00:26:50.224 --> 00:26:53.400
to fade from popular usage.
 

00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:57.454
Thomas Mann's great book,
The Magic Mountain,

00:26:57.454 --> 00:27:01.510
is perhaps the last great
artistic expression of the

00:27:01.510 --> 00:27:05.088
consumptive era and its
susceptibilities.

00:27:05.088 --> 00:27:10.690
Now, what was the idea behind
the romantic or consumptive

00:27:10.690 --> 00:27:11.588
theory?
 

00:27:11.588 --> 00:27:15.144
Its most authoritative
formulation was by the great

00:27:15.144 --> 00:27:19.195
authority of the Paris School of
Medicine, Ren� Laennec,

00:27:19.195 --> 00:27:23.313
whose drawing you just saw;
the man who invented the

00:27:23.313 --> 00:27:27.696
stethoscope and spent his life
listening to the lungs of

00:27:27.696 --> 00:27:29.690
tuberculosis patients.
 

00:27:29.690 --> 00:27:35.578
Laennec talked about what he
called the essentialist theory.

00:27:35.578 --> 00:27:39.729
Ironically, given the
opposition of the Paris School

00:27:39.729 --> 00:27:42.740
to Galen and humoralist
teachings,

00:27:42.740 --> 00:27:48.858
we could see essentialism as
actually a form of humoralism

00:27:48.858 --> 00:27:52.873
revived,
a kind of anti-contagionism in

00:27:52.873 --> 00:27:54.289
classic dress.
 

00:27:54.289 --> 00:27:56.730
Now, note the irony.
 

00:27:56.730 --> 00:28:00.990
Your friend Ackerknecht--that
is, the historian of medicine--

00:28:00.990 --> 00:28:03.450
observed dryly,
"After all,

00:28:03.450 --> 00:28:07.098
things have to be explained
somehow."

00:28:07.098 --> 00:28:12.470
Well, TB was explained
primarily by internal causes,

00:28:12.470 --> 00:28:17.420
due to the inherited essence of
the patients;

00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:22.460
his or her constitution,
or in Laennec's jargon,

00:28:22.460 --> 00:28:27.074
the patient's diathesis,
which caused him or her to be

00:28:27.074 --> 00:28:31.775
susceptible to the immediate
factors that triggered the

00:28:31.775 --> 00:28:33.430
actual illness.
 

00:28:33.430 --> 00:28:39.730
So, your diathesis was an
inborn, inherited defect.

00:28:39.730 --> 00:28:45.388
Precipiting or immediate causes
supervened, and these were

00:28:45.388 --> 00:28:50.950
thought to be some irregularity
in the patient's life.

00:28:50.950 --> 00:28:55.890
Very important in the
literature were alcoholism and

00:28:55.890 --> 00:28:57.440
sexual excess.
 

00:28:57.440 --> 00:29:03.674
Laennec postulated that two
sorts of issues were important

00:29:03.674 --> 00:29:04.660
to him.
 

00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:10.621
One were what he called les
passions tristes:

00:29:10.621 --> 00:29:15.763
melancholy, sorrow,
despair, and again sexual

00:29:15.763 --> 00:29:17.048
excess.
 

00:29:17.048 --> 00:29:22.038
The loss of bodily fluids was
thought to weaken the body and

00:29:22.038 --> 00:29:23.558
lead to illness.
 

00:29:23.558 --> 00:29:28.390
But both were almost an aspect
of an individual's fate,

00:29:28.390 --> 00:29:30.180
his or her nature.
 

00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:33.141
So, consumption,
unlike the other great epidemic

00:29:33.141 --> 00:29:35.410
killer of the nineteenth
century--

00:29:35.410 --> 00:29:40.186
that is, cholera--was not
thought to be contagious but

00:29:40.186 --> 00:29:43.665
hereditary,
and therefore its victims

00:29:43.665 --> 00:29:47.480
weren't feared or thought to be
dangerous.

00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:52.913
And tuberculosis was a slow
killer, not a cause of sudden

00:29:52.913 --> 00:29:53.690
death.
 

00:29:53.690 --> 00:29:57.286
And its symptoms,
by the canons of the day,

00:29:57.286 --> 00:30:01.653
were deemed to be respectable,
and not thought to be

00:30:01.653 --> 00:30:05.849
disgusting or a source of
unbearable torment.

00:30:05.849 --> 00:30:08.906
And death was private;
unlike cholera,

00:30:08.906 --> 00:30:11.000
not a public spectacle.
 

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:14.082
Furthermore,
tuberculosis wasn't so

00:30:14.082 --> 00:30:19.250
frightening because it was also
an endemic disease and was

00:30:19.250 --> 00:30:21.788
ever-present in society.
 

00:30:21.788 --> 00:30:26.734
So, the effects on society were
not at all like those of Asiatic

00:30:26.734 --> 00:30:27.519
cholera.
 

00:30:27.519 --> 00:30:32.135
We mustn't think of diseases as
interchangeable causes of death

00:30:32.135 --> 00:30:36.529
that have the same effects on
the societies they afflict.

00:30:36.529 --> 00:30:40.710
Tuberculosis didn't lead to
terror, hysteria,

00:30:40.710 --> 00:30:44.890
xenophobia, revolt,
and in its first phase it

00:30:44.890 --> 00:30:49.828
didn't lead to stigmatization,
but its opposite.

00:30:49.828 --> 00:30:54.481
Patients with tuberculosis were
thought to be glamorous,

00:30:54.481 --> 00:30:55.920
sexy, and chic.
 

00:30:55.920 --> 00:31:00.391
They were blameless,
as it was their hereditary that

00:31:00.391 --> 00:31:01.970
was responsible.
 

00:31:01.970 --> 00:31:05.410
And there weren't outbursts of
religiosity.

00:31:05.410 --> 00:31:10.211
There was a recognition that,
in fact, large numbers of the

00:31:10.211 --> 00:31:13.690
social elite fell victim to the
disease.

00:31:13.690 --> 00:31:16.480
There was no poisoning frenzy.
 

00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:22.430
This disease was too slow,
too unrelated to digestion,

00:31:22.430 --> 00:31:26.640
too associated with the
powerful, as well as the poor,

00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:31.634
and it was true that doctors
and officials paid their tribute

00:31:31.634 --> 00:31:33.048
to the disease.
 

00:31:33.048 --> 00:31:37.682
But it did have major social
effects, and let's think about

00:31:37.682 --> 00:31:39.680
what some of them were.
 

00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:45.759
A first was the widespread
experience of patients.

00:31:45.759 --> 00:31:49.890
This is the career of
invalidism.

00:31:49.890 --> 00:31:54.509
Tuberculosis,
after diagnosis,

00:31:54.509 --> 00:31:59.130
became a lifetime's career.
 

00:31:59.130 --> 00:32:04.344
The rest of one's life,
after receiving diagnosis,

00:32:04.344 --> 00:32:07.750
was unknown and unpredictable.
 

00:32:07.750 --> 00:32:12.473
And this would affect every
possible decision:

00:32:12.473 --> 00:32:17.106
career choices;
whether to marry and have a

00:32:17.106 --> 00:32:23.540
family, whether to place one's
normal responsibilities on hold

00:32:23.540 --> 00:32:28.920
and to devote life to seeking to
recover health.

00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:34.148
And, so, the sufferers tended
to undertake a new and

00:32:34.148 --> 00:32:39.770
all-consuming occupation,
restoring health and learning

00:32:39.770 --> 00:32:44.420
to accept what would probably be
an early death.

00:32:44.420 --> 00:32:47.338
Let's think,
for example,

00:32:47.338 --> 00:32:52.570
of Anton Chekhov,
who's the man in the left,

00:32:52.570 --> 00:32:56.828
pictured here with Leo Tolstoy.
 

00:32:56.828 --> 00:33:01.213
Now, Chekhov,
who lived from 1860 to 1904,

00:33:01.213 --> 00:33:04.848
was a sufferer from
consumption.

00:33:04.848 --> 00:33:10.315
He was forced to abandon his
own career, and his actress wife

00:33:10.315 --> 00:33:15.778
in Moscow, in the attempt to
restore his shattered health.

00:33:15.778 --> 00:33:20.950
To do so, he went to the mild
climate of the Crimea.

00:33:20.950 --> 00:33:26.576
His plays were all written in
the period of his illness,

00:33:26.576 --> 00:33:32.406
and all subtly have invalidism
as a hidden but unmentioned

00:33:32.406 --> 00:33:33.430
theme.
 

00:33:33.430 --> 00:33:38.292
The protagonists in Chekhov's
plays, not by chance,

00:33:38.292 --> 00:33:40.920
seem oddly unable to act.
 

00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:46.711
They seem to be waiting and
waiting for events beyond their

00:33:46.711 --> 00:33:48.710
control to unfold.
 

00:33:48.710 --> 00:33:52.846
The middle classes tended to go
off to what was called

00:33:52.846 --> 00:33:57.009
"taking the cure";
that is, they traveled--in

00:33:57.009 --> 00:34:00.930
Europe, they would go to a
climate that was thought to be

00:34:00.930 --> 00:34:03.770
favorable;
spas and health resorts in

00:34:03.770 --> 00:34:06.595
southern Europe,
on the French Riviera,

00:34:06.595 --> 00:34:07.710
or in Italy.
 

00:34:07.710 --> 00:34:10.420
Those were favorite
destinations.

00:34:10.420 --> 00:34:14.510
And the list of distinguished
travelers is lengthy.

00:34:14.510 --> 00:34:17.179
Keats and Shelley went to Rome.
 

00:34:17.179 --> 00:34:19.630
Tobias Smollett went to Nice.
 

00:34:19.630 --> 00:34:21.769
The Brownings went to Florence.
 

00:34:21.769 --> 00:34:24.030
Chopin went to Majorca.
 

00:34:24.030 --> 00:34:27.349
Paul Ehrlich went to Egypt.
 

00:34:27.349 --> 00:34:30.110
But this was also true in our
own country.

00:34:30.110 --> 00:34:33.804
In the United States,
people took sea journeys to

00:34:33.804 --> 00:34:37.576
recover their health,
or they traveled to the west

00:34:37.576 --> 00:34:39.268
and the southwest.
 

00:34:39.268 --> 00:34:44.307
And here the famous frontier
thesis in American history has

00:34:44.307 --> 00:34:46.219
yet another meaning.
 

00:34:46.219 --> 00:34:50.518
Health seekers formed a
substantial current--

00:34:50.518 --> 00:34:54.400
that is, of a movement
west--and turned into a

00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:59.000
large-scale movement,
with the availability of the

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.260
railroad from the 1870s.
 

00:35:01.260 --> 00:35:07.833
Colorado Springs and Pasadena
are examples of communities that

00:35:07.833 --> 00:35:11.820
were founded by,
and for, tuberculosis

00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:13.329
sufferers.
 

00:35:13.329 --> 00:35:16.409
Also popular were other
destinations;

00:35:16.409 --> 00:35:19.369
Florida and the Caribbean.
 

00:35:19.369 --> 00:35:22.739
And the cure became a kind of
industry.

00:35:22.739 --> 00:35:27.230
It was stimulated by a flood of
medical books;

00:35:27.230 --> 00:35:31.677
by rumor and anecdote;
by brochures prepared by

00:35:31.677 --> 00:35:35.659
interested parties,
such as the railroad companies.

00:35:35.659 --> 00:35:42.610
There were other exotic but
more affordable ways of seeking

00:35:42.610 --> 00:35:43.929
the cure.
 

00:35:43.929 --> 00:35:48.759
One was altitude therapy,
in which you'd go up high in a

00:35:48.759 --> 00:35:50.340
hot-air balloon.
 

00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:53.630
More commonly,
people moved outdoors simply

00:35:53.630 --> 00:35:55.119
where they lived.
 

00:35:55.119 --> 00:35:58.159
In New York City,
at the turn of the century,

00:35:58.159 --> 00:36:03.519
the buildings were dotted with
people who'd moved to live in

00:36:03.519 --> 00:36:08.699
tents on the roofs and porches
of apartment buildings,

00:36:08.699 --> 00:36:12.320
or in their backyards,
if they had them.

00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:16.679
Let me remind you of Professor
Irving Fisher,

00:36:16.679 --> 00:36:21.139
of Yale University,
who in 1907 promoted health by

00:36:21.139 --> 00:36:26.603
inventing a tent that he claimed
was perfectly ventilated for

00:36:26.603 --> 00:36:30.699
those who took to the out of
doors life,

00:36:30.699 --> 00:36:36.195
and he wanted his tent to make
outdoor living affordable for

00:36:36.195 --> 00:36:37.219
the poor.
 

00:36:37.219 --> 00:36:41.768
He himself was a consumptive,
but he regained his health

00:36:41.768 --> 00:36:46.318
after living out of doors,
and he aimed to make the cure

00:36:46.318 --> 00:36:48.469
universally available.
 

00:36:48.469 --> 00:36:50.260
If you read the New York
Times,

00:36:50.260 --> 00:36:54.599
you would see there were people
who moved not only to tents,

00:36:54.599 --> 00:36:59.289
but also to tree houses that
they constructed in their yards;

00:36:59.289 --> 00:37:02.980
an example being Charles
Battersby of Wrentham,

00:37:02.980 --> 00:37:07.150
Massachusetts,
a consumptive who constructed a

00:37:07.150 --> 00:37:13.079
house between two adjoining pine
trees and moved into it fulltime

00:37:13.079 --> 00:37:15.489
in the winter of 1906.
 

00:37:15.489 --> 00:37:19.855
Who knows to what extent the
travels of people were also a

00:37:19.855 --> 00:37:24.449
means to escape the regimens
that if they stayed at home,

00:37:24.449 --> 00:37:28.969
their physicians would have
subjected them to at home?

00:37:28.969 --> 00:37:33.670
The treatments weren't
especially enjoyable.

00:37:33.670 --> 00:37:39.920
There was bleeding and cupping,
to release the noxious agents.

00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:42.880
There were direct applications
to the lesions;

00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:47.030
poultices, ointments, infusions.
 

00:37:47.030 --> 00:37:49.650
There was also the spray
therapy;

00:37:49.650 --> 00:37:54.510
that is, inhalations in which
the doctors were attempting to

00:37:54.510 --> 00:37:59.619
attack the disease at its seat,
as you inhaled gas mixtures;

00:37:59.619 --> 00:38:05.882
creosote and carbolic acid,
had a large vogue in these

00:38:05.882 --> 00:38:07.300
centuries.
 

00:38:07.300 --> 00:38:11.110
Well, what about the
effectiveness of the travels?

00:38:11.110 --> 00:38:15.556
In some cases,
it's probably safe to say that

00:38:15.556 --> 00:38:18.590
the travels were beneficial.
 

00:38:18.590 --> 00:38:23.842
For pulmonary tuberculosis,
it probably did help to escape

00:38:23.842 --> 00:38:27.530
the urban smog of a place like
London.

00:38:27.530 --> 00:38:31.224
For Lupus vulgaris,
the disease of the skin,

00:38:31.224 --> 00:38:33.960
sunlight is known to be
beneficial.

00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:37.791
And it was probably beneficial
just to have hope,

00:38:37.791 --> 00:38:42.342
and to have the belief that you
could do something to help

00:38:42.342 --> 00:38:46.001
yourself;
that probably did more good

00:38:46.001 --> 00:38:47.070
than harm.
 

00:38:47.070 --> 00:38:51.603
Tuberculosis also clearly had
economic and demographic

00:38:51.603 --> 00:38:52.460
effects.
 

00:38:52.460 --> 00:38:56.201
Tuberculosis was the greatest
killer of the young,

00:38:56.201 --> 00:38:59.331
at the time,
and it inevitably limited the

00:38:59.331 --> 00:39:01.239
growth of population.
 

00:39:01.239 --> 00:39:06.536
It limited the expansion of the
economy and caused widespread

00:39:06.536 --> 00:39:07.420
poverty.
 

00:39:07.420 --> 00:39:13.766
There was a new awareness and
sensitivity to this death,

00:39:13.766 --> 00:39:15.960
with romanticism.
 

00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:19.014
Tuberculosis,
I want to say,

00:39:19.014 --> 00:39:23.090
was not the cause of
romanticism,

00:39:23.090 --> 00:39:28.500
but it is true that romantic
literature,

00:39:28.500 --> 00:39:33.338
and the arts,
did fit some qualities about

00:39:33.338 --> 00:39:35.110
tuberculosis.
 

00:39:35.110 --> 00:39:40.347
That is, romanticism stressed
the transience of youth,

00:39:40.347 --> 00:39:44.498
early death,
melancholy, life as ephemeral,

00:39:44.498 --> 00:39:48.550
the importance of autumn as a
symbol;

00:39:48.550 --> 00:39:53.904
no longer now a symbol of the
harvest, but as a time of

00:39:53.904 --> 00:39:59.159
falling leaves and dying
flowers, as death sets in.

00:39:59.159 --> 00:40:02.750
Genius was part of it.
 

00:40:02.750 --> 00:40:06.978
The redemptive and ennobling
idea of suffering,

00:40:06.978 --> 00:40:12.588
that releases the life of the
soul, as the gross material body

00:40:12.588 --> 00:40:14.059
wastes away.
 

00:40:14.059 --> 00:40:18.670
And there was a poetic quality
that was attributed to

00:40:18.670 --> 00:40:20.000
tuberculosis.
 

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:25.880
It was said to release genius
and creativity.

00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:30.630
One sees this portrayed in
romantic works in the century.

00:40:30.630 --> 00:40:33.610
Emily Bront�,
Wuthering Heights;

00:40:33.610 --> 00:40:34.471
Victor Hugo,
Les

00:40:34.471 --> 00:40:41.090
Mis�rables;
Alexandre Dumas, Henri Murger.

00:40:41.090 --> 00:40:44.583
Or romantic opera:
Verdi's La Traviata,

00:40:44.583 --> 00:40:48.309
or Puccini's La
Boh�me.

00:40:48.309 --> 00:40:51.706
Then I would argue that
tuberculosis also--so,

00:40:51.706 --> 00:40:54.123
it had an effect,
and the effect,

00:40:54.123 --> 00:40:57.219
the causal chain worked in both
ways;

00:40:57.219 --> 00:41:00.018
an effect in promoting
romanticism,

00:41:00.018 --> 00:41:04.516
and romanticism in turn
promoted a certain understanding

00:41:04.516 --> 00:41:08.440
or social construction of the
disease itself--

00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:11.619
had a major impact then on
literature,

00:41:11.619 --> 00:41:15.110
and was portrayed often in
literature,

00:41:15.110 --> 00:41:18.380
and indeed in the opera.
 

00:41:18.380 --> 00:41:23.949
Tuberculosis also had an effect
on gender issues.

00:41:23.949 --> 00:41:29.936
I would argue that it helped to
promote a new idea of feminine

00:41:29.936 --> 00:41:32.489
beauty: thin,
elongated;

00:41:32.489 --> 00:41:34.519
tubercular, in short.
 

00:41:34.519 --> 00:41:36.070
Pallor.
 

00:41:36.070 --> 00:41:39.483
At the time,
white powders--not suntan oil,

00:41:39.483 --> 00:41:41.840
as today--were the fashion.
 

00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:44.949
Let me show you an example.
 

00:41:44.949 --> 00:41:49.070
This is a famous painting of a
woman at the table,

00:41:49.070 --> 00:41:50.920
by Toulouse Lautrec.
 

00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:55.184
And you'll note that she looks
extremely pallid,

00:41:55.184 --> 00:41:57.000
and is quite thin.
 

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:01.909
But what I wanted to point out
is what she has in front of her,

00:42:01.909 --> 00:42:07.771
which is a pot of rice powder
that she puts on her face to

00:42:07.771 --> 00:42:11.679
imitate the pallor of a
consumptive.

00:42:11.679 --> 00:42:15.496
One can see this also in the
paintings of the

00:42:15.496 --> 00:42:19.139
pre-Raphaelites,
whose favorite models were

00:42:19.139 --> 00:42:22.090
often women with tuberculosis.
 

00:42:22.090 --> 00:42:24.847
Elizabeth Siddal,
for example,

00:42:24.847 --> 00:42:29.697
was a model for ten years,
and then became the wife,

00:42:29.697 --> 00:42:33.978
of Dante Rossetti,
and became also a model for

00:42:33.978 --> 00:42:35.309
Millais.
 

00:42:35.309 --> 00:42:38.844
Jane Burden became the model,
and also the wife,

00:42:38.844 --> 00:42:40.349
of William Morris.
 

00:42:40.349 --> 00:42:44.338
And one can see some of
the--you can see the

00:42:44.338 --> 00:42:53.909
elongated--this is Mariana;
this is the Beata Beatrix.

00:42:53.909 --> 00:42:57.753
In any case then,
consumption was a fatal,

00:42:57.753 --> 00:43:02.440
debilitating and excruciatingly
painful disease.

00:43:02.440 --> 00:43:07.617
But paradoxically then it was
given positive associations in

00:43:07.617 --> 00:43:11.039
the way it was described at the
time.

00:43:11.039 --> 00:43:15.239
Tuberculosis was said to make
the body beautiful,

00:43:15.239 --> 00:43:20.880
to make a person spiritual by
wasting away the gross flesh,

00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:25.750
and it was said to enhance
creativity and genius.

00:43:25.750 --> 00:43:29.530
How can this be explained?
 

00:43:29.530 --> 00:43:33.661
Well, in the United States,
tuberculosis was also thought

00:43:33.661 --> 00:43:37.864
to be the white plague,
partly because it was popularly

00:43:37.864 --> 00:43:42.068
regarded as a disease that
affected the white race and not

00:43:42.068 --> 00:43:45.099
African-Americans,
who were thought to have a

00:43:45.099 --> 00:43:47.862
different affliction in the
middle of the nineteenth

00:43:47.862 --> 00:43:48.460
century.
 

00:43:48.460 --> 00:43:51.186
Tellingly, it was called
"the white man's

00:43:51.186 --> 00:43:54.338
plague" and "the white
man's scourge,"

00:43:54.338 --> 00:43:55.550
in this country.
 

00:43:55.550 --> 00:43:58.409
And in Europe,
it wasn't associated in the

00:43:58.409 --> 00:44:01.268
popular mind with the working
classes,

00:44:01.268 --> 00:44:05.389
and people remembered that
aristocrats and artistic

00:44:05.389 --> 00:44:08.190
celebrities often contracted it.
 

00:44:08.190 --> 00:44:12.199
You can see the power of what
we might call advertising,

00:44:12.199 --> 00:44:15.170
the endless stream of novels,
poems,

00:44:15.170 --> 00:44:20.514
operas, that extolled the
beauty and sensitivity of those

00:44:20.514 --> 00:44:21.659
afflicted.
 

00:44:21.659 --> 00:44:24.762
In addition,
recalling what we said about

00:44:24.762 --> 00:44:28.744
bubonic plague,
tuberculosis did not evoke the

00:44:28.744 --> 00:44:32.710
fear of mors repentina:
sudden death,

00:44:32.710 --> 00:44:37.880
so dreaded with bubonic plague
or Asiatic cholera.

00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:41.250
With consumption,
there was no danger that a

00:44:41.250 --> 00:44:46.032
person would be caught unaware
and not even have time to write

00:44:46.032 --> 00:44:47.599
his or her will.
 

00:44:47.599 --> 00:44:50.150
The disease was spiritual,
in part,

00:44:50.150 --> 00:44:55.231
because it warned the sufferer
of death in ample time to work

00:44:55.231 --> 00:45:00.059
out one's relationship with God
and with the community.

00:45:00.059 --> 00:45:03.369
There was also a simple matter
of comparison.

00:45:03.369 --> 00:45:06.340
Consumption death,
consumptive death,

00:45:06.340 --> 00:45:10.550
was perhaps construed as
beautiful because pulmonary

00:45:10.550 --> 00:45:15.090
disease didn't disfigure in the
manner of smallpox.

00:45:15.090 --> 00:45:19.650
Its symptoms weren't degrading,
in the manner of Asiatic

00:45:19.650 --> 00:45:20.480
cholera.
 

00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:24.514
Well so to make the point,
let's turn to a work that

00:45:24.514 --> 00:45:28.652
probably all of you know,
the most influential,

00:45:28.652 --> 00:45:32.960
best-selling novel of the
nineteenth century,

00:45:32.960 --> 00:45:37.690
which was Harriet Beecher
Stowe, Uncle Tom's Cabin.

00:45:37.690 --> 00:45:42.199
You probably know very well
that it was a religious novel,

00:45:42.199 --> 00:45:47.409
about social justice and God's
way with man,

00:45:47.409 --> 00:45:52.670
that it was about Simon Legree
and the horrors of slavery,

00:45:52.670 --> 00:45:55.590
and called for abolition.
 

00:45:55.590 --> 00:46:01.103
But you've probably forgotten
that it was also a major

00:46:01.103 --> 00:46:05.264
tuberculosis novel,
and that the heroine,

00:46:05.264 --> 00:46:10.050
the child Little Eva,
dies of consumption.

00:46:10.050 --> 00:46:14.963
Let me remind you of how
Harriet Beecher Stowe described

00:46:14.963 --> 00:46:16.750
approaching death.
 

00:46:16.750 --> 00:46:20.369
And she wrote:
"For so bright and placid

00:46:20.369 --> 00:46:24.320
was the farewell voyage of the
little spirit--

00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:29.005
by such sweet and fragrant
breezes was the small bark borne

00:46:29.005 --> 00:46:33.476
towards the heavenly shores--
-that it was impossible to

00:46:33.476 --> 00:46:36.199
realize that death was
approaching.

00:46:36.199 --> 00:46:41.567
The child felt no pain,
only a tranquil soft weakness,

00:46:41.567 --> 00:46:45.719
daily and almost insensibly
increasing.

00:46:45.719 --> 00:46:49.780
And she was so beautiful,
so loving,

00:46:49.780 --> 00:46:52.945
so trustful,
so happy, that one could not

00:46:52.945 --> 00:46:57.934
resist the soothing influence of
that air of innocence and peace

00:46:57.934 --> 00:47:01.260
that seemed to breathe all
around her.

00:47:01.260 --> 00:47:04.840
Her father found a strange calm
coming over him.

00:47:04.840 --> 00:47:07.730
It wasn't hope--that was
impossible;

00:47:07.730 --> 00:47:11.244
it was not resignation;
it was only a calm resting in

00:47:11.244 --> 00:47:14.873
the present that seemed so
beautiful that he wished to

00:47:14.873 --> 00:47:16.380
think of no future.
 

00:47:16.380 --> 00:47:20.469
It was like that hush of spirit
that we feel amid the bright,

00:47:20.469 --> 00:47:24.576
mild woods of autumn,
when the bright hectic flush is

00:47:24.576 --> 00:47:28.436
on the trees,
and the last lingering flowers

00:47:28.436 --> 00:47:31.987
by the brook;
and we joy in it all the more,

00:47:31.987 --> 00:47:35.960
because we know that it will
soon pass away."

00:47:35.960 --> 00:47:41.449
Now, I would argue that this
bears little relationship to the

00:47:41.449 --> 00:47:47.489
actual extraordinary suffering
of tuberculosis at the very end,

00:47:47.489 --> 00:47:52.972
and I think it makes a good way
to have a transition from the

00:47:52.972 --> 00:47:58.820
consumptive era to what I would
call the era of tuberculosis,

00:47:58.820 --> 00:48:01.960
when the way that disease,
this disease,

00:48:01.960 --> 00:48:06.869
was constructed and understood
changes radically.

00:48:06.869 --> 00:48:11.416
And this comes about after the
germ theory of disease and the

00:48:11.416 --> 00:48:15.934
work of Robert Koch,
when the disease was found not

00:48:15.934 --> 00:48:20.190
to be hereditary and due to
one's diathesis,

00:48:20.190 --> 00:48:24.150
but to be a nasty,
contagious disease,

00:48:24.150 --> 00:48:27.630
when sufferers became objects
of fear,

00:48:27.630 --> 00:48:32.652
and stigma attached to them;
when the glamour of consumption

00:48:32.652 --> 00:48:36.320
was stripped away,
as was its association with

00:48:36.320 --> 00:48:40.632
feminine beauty,
and male genius and poetry,

00:48:40.632 --> 00:48:46.279
and its appeal as a period of
spirituality and sexuality

00:48:46.279 --> 00:48:47.820
disappeared.
 

00:48:47.820 --> 00:48:51.112
So, that's what I want to talk
about next time,

00:48:51.112 --> 00:48:55.552
which is the movement from the
era of consumption to the era of

00:48:55.552 --> 00:48:56.769
tuberculosis.
 

00:48:56.769 --> 00:49:02.000

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:03.320
Prof: Good morning
everyone.

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:05.350
We are finally there.
 

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.704
We are finally at the
Colosseum, the very icon of

00:00:09.704 --> 00:00:10.340
Rome.
 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.474
And because I think of the
Colosseum as the very icon of

00:00:13.474 --> 00:00:15.974
Rome,
I've called today's lecture

00:00:15.974 --> 00:00:20.518
"The Creation of an Icon:
The Colosseum and Contemporary

00:00:20.518 --> 00:00:22.790
Architecture in Rome."
 

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:26.992
But before we discuss the
Colosseum, I want to say a few

00:00:26.992 --> 00:00:30.890
words, a few more words,
about Nero, the last of the

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.030
Julio-Claudian emperors.
 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.100
And I show you a portrait of
Nero here, ensconced in his

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.318
Domus Aurea, with the Fourth
Style wall of Fabullus behind

00:00:41.318 --> 00:00:41.910
him.
 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.247
And I wanted to just say,
and bring your attention to the

00:00:47.247 --> 00:00:49.368
fact,
that it really is quite amazing

00:00:49.368 --> 00:00:51.736
that we have the names of so
many of Nero's artists and

00:00:51.736 --> 00:00:52.350
architects.
 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.966
And that can only attest to the
fact that he must have gathered

00:00:55.966 --> 00:00:59.000
around him truly the greatest
artists of the day,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.082
artists whose accomplishments
were so superb that their names

00:01:03.082 --> 00:01:07.302
had been recorded for posterity
at a time when very few artists

00:01:07.302 --> 00:01:09.890
and architects names are
recorded.

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.069
And I just want to remind you
of that group.

00:01:12.069 --> 00:01:15.560
Think, of course,
of the painter of Nero,

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.518
the man who was responsible for
painting the Third Style walls

00:01:20.518 --> 00:01:23.872
of Nero's Domus Aurea,
Fabullus himself,

00:01:23.872 --> 00:01:28.540
and who also appears to have
been the innovator of the Fourth

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.030
Style of Roman wall painting.
 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.510
There was also Zenodorus,
who was the most famous bronze

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:38.352
caster of his day,
a Greek artist of great renown,

00:01:38.352 --> 00:01:42.080
whom Nero hired to make his
colossal statue,

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.129
the colossal statue 125 feet
tall, out of bronze,

00:01:46.129 --> 00:01:51.269
that depicted Nero in the guise
of the sun god Sol,

00:01:51.269 --> 00:01:55.239
and a statue that was referred
to as "The Colossus."

00:01:55.239 --> 00:01:59.519
And lastly, but not least by
any stretch of the imagination,

00:01:59.519 --> 00:02:03.780
were the two architects of
Nero, Severus and Celer--

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.188
Roman architects we
believe--Severus and Celer,

00:02:07.188 --> 00:02:10.520
who were responsible for the
Domus Aurea itself,

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.941
for all the architectural
innovations and experimentations

00:02:14.941 --> 00:02:16.568
at the Domus Aurea.
 

00:02:16.568 --> 00:02:21.246
And it was they who we believe
were the creators of the

00:02:21.246 --> 00:02:26.008
remarkable octagonal room:
as I mentioned last time,

00:02:26.008 --> 00:02:28.175
probably the most extraordinary
room we've seen thus far this

00:02:28.175 --> 00:02:31.439
semester,
and one that's going to have

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:37.000
lasting impact on later Roman
buildings and complexes.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.169
So the octagonal room,
and also I mentioned to you

00:02:39.169 --> 00:02:41.515
other things in the villa,
including a banqueting hall

00:02:41.515 --> 00:02:42.800
with a revolving ceiling.
 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.678
So these men,
also great architectural

00:02:45.678 --> 00:02:46.690
innovators.
 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.370
So when Nero is forced to
commit suicide in 68,

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.090
we have to ask ourselves,
what happened to those artists?

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.899
What happened to those
innovations after Nero was

00:02:58.899 --> 00:03:00.008
discredited?
 

00:03:00.008 --> 00:03:05.408
And I mentioned also last time
that when Nero committed

00:03:05.408 --> 00:03:07.913
suicide,
when he was discredited,

00:03:07.913 --> 00:03:10.953
he received an official
damnatio memoriae from

00:03:10.953 --> 00:03:13.729
the Senate,
a damnation of his memory,

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:16.800
which meant that his portraits
could be,

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.120
and were encouraged to be,
destroyed,

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.870
and the same with his buildings.
 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.617
So what is going to happen to
the evolution of Roman

00:03:24.617 --> 00:03:27.258
architecture when one of its
greatest patrons,

00:03:27.258 --> 00:03:31.097
someone who encouraged the
greatest architects and artists

00:03:31.097 --> 00:03:33.413
of the day,
when he and his memory are

00:03:33.413 --> 00:03:35.788
annihilated and his buildings
are destroyed?

00:03:35.788 --> 00:03:38.770
What is going to happen to
architectural innovation?

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:42.479
That's the main question we
need to ask ourselves today,

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:45.464
as we look at the buildings
that were commissioned by his

00:03:45.464 --> 00:03:48.095
successors,
by members of the Flavian

00:03:48.095 --> 00:03:53.008
dynasty--Vespasian,
Titus and ultimately Domitian.

00:03:53.008 --> 00:03:55.979
We'll talk about Vespasian
today, a bit on Titus,

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:59.008
and then more on Titus and
Domitian on Tuesday.

00:03:59.008 --> 00:04:01.187
What happens to these
innovations when they begin to

00:04:01.187 --> 00:04:03.580
take over and when they begin to
commission buildings?

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:05.258
And we're going to see it's
mixed.

00:04:05.258 --> 00:04:08.568
We're going to see a certain
move back toward a conservative

00:04:08.568 --> 00:04:10.798
vision,
but we're also going to see

00:04:10.798 --> 00:04:15.080
that Nero's innovations live on,
and that's the most exciting

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.350
piece of this particular Flavian
puzzle,

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:20.990
as we shall see.
 

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:23.480
So we see again Nero here.
 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:28.507
And when Nero died in 68 A.D.,
what happened was not only that

00:04:28.507 --> 00:04:31.970
he received a damnatio
memoriae,

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:35.100
but there were no other
Julio-Claudians to succeed him,

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.379
and Rome and the Empire were
plunged,

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:40.529
once again, into a very serious
civil war,

00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:45.740
a civil war that was as
profoundly troubling as the

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:50.639
civil war that had followed
Caesar's death --

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:54.601
Caesars death,
as you know,

00:04:54.601 --> 00:04:56.430
in 44 B.C.
 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:59.060
And what emerged after this
civil war,

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:03.406
or during this civil war,
was one of the most complicated

00:05:03.406 --> 00:05:06.588
and difficult years in Rome's
history,

00:05:06.588 --> 00:05:10.572
the year 68 to 69,
during which Rome had four

00:05:10.572 --> 00:05:12.586
emperors,
not co-emperors,

00:05:12.586 --> 00:05:15.370
as Rome was to have much later
in its history,

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:19.089
but competing emperors,
in very quick succession,

00:05:19.089 --> 00:05:22.540
some of them holding onto power
for only a few months.

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:26.504
These men were Galba,
G-a-l-b-a, whose portrait you

00:05:26.504 --> 00:05:32.148
see on a coin in the upper left;
Galba who becomes emperor right

00:05:32.148 --> 00:05:34.050
after Nero's death.
 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:36.750
And you can see him in a
no-nonsense, realistic portrait

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:38.370
on that coin in the upper left.
 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:42.930
He is succeeded very soon after
by a man by the name of Otho,

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:43.690
O-t-h-o.
 

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:48.009
You see him on the gold coin on
the right.

00:05:48.009 --> 00:05:51.129
Otho who saw Nero as a soul
mate and had himself rendered

00:05:51.129 --> 00:05:54.139
very much with a Neronian
hairstyle, as you can see.

00:05:54.139 --> 00:05:58.220
And then third,
a man by the name of Vitellius,

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:01.910
V-i-t-e-l-l-i-u-s,
Vitellius who seems to have had

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:06.430
more chins than any other
emperor in the history of Rome,

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:08.904
as you can see in this
wonderful portrait now in

00:06:08.904 --> 00:06:09.588
Copenhagen.
 

00:06:09.588 --> 00:06:14.050
And then ultimately Vespasian,
V-e-s-p-a-s-i-a-n,

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:18.586
Vespasian, who was the only one
of these four who was able to

00:06:18.586 --> 00:06:22.444
hold onto power long enough to
create a new dynasty:

00:06:22.444 --> 00:06:26.680
a new dynasty that he called
after his family name--

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:31.139
Flavius was his family
name--the so-called Flavian

00:06:31.139 --> 00:06:32.050
dynasty.
 

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:37.572
And fortune was on his side,
because he had two sons to

00:06:37.572 --> 00:06:42.884
succeed him, Titus and Domitian;
and because he had two sons to

00:06:42.884 --> 00:06:46.067
succeed him, he was able to
create a quite successful

00:06:46.067 --> 00:06:49.250
dynasty, as we shall see,
that had lasting power.

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:52.449
So this is our second main
imperial dynasty,

00:06:52.449 --> 00:06:56.170
the Flavian dynasty,
as opposed to the Augustan and

00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:58.180
Julio-Claudian dynasty.
 

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:01.920
Now Vespasian came to power in
a civil war,

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:05.071
and like Augustus before him,
he recognized that although

00:07:05.071 --> 00:07:08.334
coming to power in a civil war
could give you the authority

00:07:08.334 --> 00:07:11.081
that you needed to govern,
it didn't give you the

00:07:11.081 --> 00:07:11.629
legitimacy.
 

00:07:11.629 --> 00:07:15.199
It was very important in the
eyes of the Romans to have had

00:07:15.199 --> 00:07:18.216
an important foreign victory,
to give your dynasty

00:07:18.216 --> 00:07:19.139
legitimacy.
 

00:07:19.139 --> 00:07:22.860
Augustus came to power after
his civil war with Mark Antony,

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:26.209
but he looked to his victory
over the Parthians,

00:07:26.209 --> 00:07:29.077
in the eastern part of the
Empire, to give his reign

00:07:29.077 --> 00:07:29.810
legitimacy.
 

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:31.660
Vespasian does the same thing.
 

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:33.069
He comes to power in a civil
war.

00:07:33.069 --> 00:07:35.199
He beats back other Romans.
 

00:07:35.199 --> 00:07:38.843
So he has to look elsewhere for
legitimacy, and he also looks

00:07:38.843 --> 00:07:39.269
east.
 

00:07:39.269 --> 00:07:44.350
He looks specifically to Judea,
and he sends his son in,

00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:48.209
his son Titus in,
to do war against Jerusalem,

00:07:48.209 --> 00:07:52.699
and Titus was victorious in the
early 70s A.D.,

00:07:52.699 --> 00:07:57.591
in this very important Jewish
War, that I'll have more to say

00:07:57.591 --> 00:08:01.750
about later today and also
especially on Tuesday.

00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:06.829
So Vespasian also is a--with
his son Titus--

00:08:06.829 --> 00:08:10.660
is a victor in a foreign war,
and that becomes the basis of

00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:13.552
their right to rule,
and we'll see references to

00:08:13.552 --> 00:08:15.531
those Jewish Wars,
in their art,

00:08:15.531 --> 00:08:17.899
even in our conversation today.
 

00:08:17.899 --> 00:08:20.730
I also want to say with regard
to Vespasian,

00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:25.060
not only was he a great
military strategist,

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:29.670
but he also seems to have been
an extremely shrewd politician,

00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:33.471
someone who recognized that you
could use architecture in the

00:08:33.471 --> 00:08:36.423
service of ideology--
and that's in fact what we're

00:08:36.423 --> 00:08:39.769
going to see him doing today--
and he starts this from the

00:08:39.769 --> 00:08:41.649
very beginning of his reign.
 

00:08:41.649 --> 00:08:46.331
I go back here to--and we'll
look at it a number of times

00:08:46.331 --> 00:08:48.566
today;
it really is going to loom

00:08:48.566 --> 00:08:52.361
large in today's discussion--the
site plan of Nero's Domus Aurea

00:08:52.361 --> 00:08:54.230
that we looked at last time.
 

00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:58.226
And you'll remember the
location of the Golden House of

00:08:58.226 --> 00:09:00.725
Nero,
up on the Esquiline Hill,

00:09:00.725 --> 00:09:03.928
the only part of it that still
survives,

00:09:03.928 --> 00:09:07.288
the so-called Esquiline Wing,
which you can see there.

00:09:07.288 --> 00:09:09.038
And here, the great artificial
lake.

00:09:09.038 --> 00:09:13.570
The Colossus by Zenodorus,
located over there.

00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:21.533
And you can see the way those
are deployed in that 300 to 350

00:09:21.533 --> 00:09:28.700
acres of area that Nero had his
architects build up.

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:34.000
Vespasian, as he thinks about
how to move forward,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.340
with architecture and to begin
to commission buildings,

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:39.360
the first thing that strikes
him, very wisely,

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:42.529
is he does not want to
associate himself with Nero;

00:09:42.529 --> 00:09:45.774
in fact, he wants to
disassociate himself with Nero,

00:09:45.774 --> 00:09:47.428
who has now been damned.
 

00:09:47.428 --> 00:09:49.716
But he looks back at the
Julio-Claudians and he

00:09:49.716 --> 00:09:52.601
recognizes that there is some
merit in linking himself with

00:09:52.601 --> 00:09:55.557
them,
and quite specifically with

00:09:55.557 --> 00:09:58.643
Claudius,
who was the best--after,

00:09:58.643 --> 00:10:02.961
in addition to Augustus--
was the best of the more recent

00:10:02.961 --> 00:10:05.484
lot,
and Claudius was made into a

00:10:05.484 --> 00:10:06.850
god at his death.
 

00:10:06.850 --> 00:10:11.410
So he looks to Claudius,
and he notices the fact that

00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:16.322
there is a Temple of Claudius
that was begun on this very

00:10:16.322 --> 00:10:20.113
property by Claudius' wife,
his last wife,

00:10:20.113 --> 00:10:22.976
Agrippina the Younger--
the woman with the poisoned

00:10:22.976 --> 00:10:24.792
mushrooms--
Agrippina the Younger,

00:10:24.792 --> 00:10:28.308
who also, you'll recall,
was the mother of Nero.

00:10:28.308 --> 00:10:32.768
And Agrippina the Younger had
begun, after Claudius' death and

00:10:32.768 --> 00:10:36.129
divinization,
a temple in honor of Claudius.

00:10:36.129 --> 00:10:40.870
Nero, who had no particular
affection for his mother,

00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:42.840
and as you'll remember had her
murdered,

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:46.003
decided that he didn't want any
part of her building project

00:10:46.003 --> 00:10:48.500
either,
and put a stop to it;

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:52.325
especially when he decided that
he had other plans for this

00:10:52.325 --> 00:10:55.754
particular area of Rome,
namely to build his pleasure

00:10:55.754 --> 00:10:56.480
palace.
 

00:10:56.480 --> 00:11:00.009
So Nero stops construction--he
doesn't destroy the building but

00:11:00.009 --> 00:11:03.370
he stops construction on it--and
just leaves it as it is.

00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:05.840
The light bulb goes on for
Vespasian,

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:08.818
and Vespasian says to himself:
"The best way that I can

00:11:08.818 --> 00:11:10.889
use architecture to make a
connection,

00:11:10.889 --> 00:11:15.769
to make a link between myself
and the Julio-Claudians,

00:11:15.769 --> 00:11:19.450
especially Claudius,
is to finish the Temple of

00:11:19.450 --> 00:11:22.490
Claudius that Agrippina
began."

00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:25.847
And that's exactly what he sets
out to do, and he does this at

00:11:25.847 --> 00:11:27.720
the very beginning of his reign.
 

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:29.510
We give a date of A.D.
 

00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:33.418
70 to the so-called Temple of
Divine Claudius,

00:11:33.418 --> 00:11:38.340
or as it is often referred to,
the Claudianum in Rome,

00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:42.220
and you see again the location
of that Claudianum right here.

00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:46.820
Now all that survives of this
building today is its platform,

00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:50.114
and I'm going to show you some
details of that platform in a

00:11:50.114 --> 00:11:51.841
moment: a tall,
great platform,

00:11:51.841 --> 00:11:54.438
like the platforms of the
sanctuaries that we looked at

00:11:54.438 --> 00:11:58.200
earlier this semester,
upon which the temple rested.

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:02.139
All that survives is part of
that platform.

00:12:02.139 --> 00:12:06.732
And what I show you first here
is a restored view that comes

00:12:06.732 --> 00:12:11.135
from the Ward-Perkins textbook,
where you can get a very good

00:12:11.135 --> 00:12:13.620
sense of what this platform
looked like.

00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:17.022
It was a two-storied platform,
as I think you can see very

00:12:17.022 --> 00:12:17.440
well.
 

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:19.710
It had barrel-vaulted chambers.
 

00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:22.791
It was made out of concrete;
barrel-vaulted chambers made

00:12:22.791 --> 00:12:23.830
out of concrete.
 

00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:27.177
And then, on the front,
there were doorways at the

00:12:27.177 --> 00:12:29.908
bottom and windows on the second
tier.

00:12:29.908 --> 00:12:33.927
And the facing,
the facing for the concrete was

00:12:33.927 --> 00:12:36.317
travertine,
cut stone travertine,

00:12:36.317 --> 00:12:38.490
which should immediately ring a
bell,

00:12:38.490 --> 00:12:42.528
because you'll remember that it
was cut stone travertine that

00:12:42.528 --> 00:12:45.759
was also used for Claudius'
harbor at Portus,

00:12:45.759 --> 00:12:50.210
and also for the Porta Maggiore
in Rome.

00:12:50.210 --> 00:12:54.740
And you'll remember also the
intriguing combination of

00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:59.783
rusticated masonry and smooth
masonry for those two Claudian

00:12:59.783 --> 00:13:00.980
buildings.
 

00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:03.240
The same is true here.
 

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:06.392
So when Agrippina made a
decision to put up a building

00:13:06.392 --> 00:13:08.875
honoring her husband,
after his death,

00:13:08.875 --> 00:13:12.178
a temple that would be to him
as a divus,

00:13:12.178 --> 00:13:15.874
she turns back to the style
that he himself seems to have

00:13:15.874 --> 00:13:18.370
favored,
this combination of rusticated

00:13:18.370 --> 00:13:21.960
and finished masonry,
to use for that building.

00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:25.918
And I think this underscores
the point that I made last time.

00:13:25.918 --> 00:13:29.041
This choice of style,
of this rusticated masonry

00:13:29.041 --> 00:13:32.759
style, is not something that
happened by happenstance.

00:13:32.759 --> 00:13:36.640
It is likely because of
Claudius' own predilection as a

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:39.412
patron,
so that when Agrippina decided

00:13:39.412 --> 00:13:42.970
how it would be best to honor
him architecturally,

00:13:42.970 --> 00:13:46.889
she wanted to honor him in the
style that he himself liked.

00:13:46.889 --> 00:13:51.107
So she uses again this
combination of rusticated and

00:13:51.107 --> 00:13:52.678
finished masonry.
 

00:13:52.678 --> 00:13:57.380
I can show you again some
preserved sections of the podium

00:13:57.380 --> 00:14:02.000
of the Temple of Divine Claudius
that will make this even

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:02.990
clearer.
 

00:14:02.990 --> 00:14:06.392
Before I do--and you see it on
the right-hand side of the

00:14:06.392 --> 00:14:07.884
screen--
just to remind you,

00:14:07.884 --> 00:14:09.889
at the left,
of some of the great podia that

00:14:09.889 --> 00:14:11.658
we looked at earlier this
semester.

00:14:11.658 --> 00:14:14.307
And since the exam is coming
up, there's no time like the

00:14:14.307 --> 00:14:16.200
present to see if you know your
stuff.

00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:21.442
Can anyone identify this podium
here on the left-hand side of

00:14:21.442 --> 00:14:22.580
the screen?
 

00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:26.409
Student:  Is that the
Sanctuary of Jupiter Anxur?

00:14:26.409 --> 00:14:27.120
Prof: Excellent.
 

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:30.210
The Sanctuary of Jupiter Anxur
at Terracina;

00:14:30.210 --> 00:14:31.408
that's the podium.
 

00:14:31.408 --> 00:14:34.071
And you'll remember what was
characteristic of it is that it

00:14:34.071 --> 00:14:35.288
was made out of concrete.
 

00:14:35.288 --> 00:14:37.940
It was faced with opus
incertum.

00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:41.322
It had travertine at the
corners and over the arches,

00:14:41.322 --> 00:14:44.187
and it had lateral arches,
as well as others,

00:14:44.187 --> 00:14:46.529
to allow the free flow of
space.

00:14:46.529 --> 00:14:50.642
So this idea of these great
concrete podiums that served as

00:14:50.642 --> 00:14:54.330
the base for sanctuaries,
it's the same idea here.

00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:59.409
We see again a podium that also
has arches, as you can see,

00:14:59.409 --> 00:15:03.878
and then on the front of those
arches, in this case,

00:15:03.878 --> 00:15:05.629
great pilasters.
 

00:15:05.629 --> 00:15:09.528
And if you look at those
pilasters very carefully--

00:15:09.528 --> 00:15:12.418
and again it's done out of
travertine in this case--

00:15:12.418 --> 00:15:14.038
when you look at those very
carefully,

00:15:14.038 --> 00:15:16.940
you see something very
interesting here,

00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:19.423
that makes these slightly
different from the other two

00:15:19.423 --> 00:15:20.080
that we saw.
 

00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:23.870
Because you can see that the
capital is finished;

00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:26.408
you can see the upper part of
the pilaster;

00:15:26.408 --> 00:15:28.511
and then if you look very--and
then below that,

00:15:28.511 --> 00:15:30.570
of course, you see these
rusticated blocks.

00:15:30.570 --> 00:15:35.703
But if you look at the--in
between each of those rusticated

00:15:35.703 --> 00:15:37.785
blocks,
very carefully--and I'll show

00:15:37.785 --> 00:15:40.344
you a better image in a moment
where you can see this even more

00:15:40.344 --> 00:15:43.452
clearly--
you will see that part of the

00:15:43.452 --> 00:15:49.038
pilaster emerges in between each
of those rusticated blocks,

00:15:49.038 --> 00:15:53.913
giving us even more the sense
that that finished pilaster is

00:15:53.913 --> 00:15:57.220
somehow inside the rusticated
blocks,

00:15:57.220 --> 00:16:01.139
waiting to emerge,
in a very interesting way.

00:16:01.139 --> 00:16:04.019
And we could psychoanalyze
Claudius.

00:16:04.019 --> 00:16:07.791
We've talked about his past and
how he was not--he was ignored

00:16:07.791 --> 00:16:11.500
as a child, and he was shunted
aside because he stammered and

00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:12.120
so on.
 

00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:17.001
One could go very far and say
that's Claudius waiting inside

00:16:17.001 --> 00:16:20.640
to emerge sometime;
it's like a cocoon that allows

00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:24.000
the butterfly to emerge at some
point later in life.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.048
We could try that.
 

00:16:26.048 --> 00:16:27.658
I don't know whether you would
buy that.

00:16:27.658 --> 00:16:31.491
But it's one way in which one
can think about this sort of

00:16:31.491 --> 00:16:32.028
thing.
 

00:16:32.028 --> 00:16:33.197
But clearly,
whatever it meant,

00:16:33.197 --> 00:16:35.340
if it was just to point to his
antiquarian interest,

00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:38.200
his interest in more
old-fashioned stone construction

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:42.061
at this particular point,
it does seem to have something

00:16:42.061 --> 00:16:46.316
to do with the particular
personality of this particular

00:16:46.316 --> 00:16:47.090
patron.
 

00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:52.412
Here's another--here's just
comparing the podium of the

00:16:52.412 --> 00:16:56.750
Claudianum to the Porta Maggiore
in Rome,

00:16:56.750 --> 00:17:00.009
just to remind you of the
rusticated columns there,

00:17:00.009 --> 00:17:03.129
the rusticated drums of these
engaged columns,

00:17:03.129 --> 00:17:07.874
and then at the uppermost part
the way in which the upper part

00:17:07.874 --> 00:17:12.463
of the column and the capital
are dressed smooth and seem to

00:17:12.463 --> 00:17:13.318
emerge.
 

00:17:13.318 --> 00:17:17.102
And that's when I first made
that point about the likelihood

00:17:17.102 --> 00:17:19.635
that the column--
that we're supposed to read

00:17:19.635 --> 00:17:21.490
this as the column completed
inside,

00:17:21.490 --> 00:17:26.143
just waiting to break free;
and we see the same thing,

00:17:26.143 --> 00:17:28.410
but a further elaboration of
that here.

00:17:28.410 --> 00:17:32.739
And I think you can see that
much better in this particular

00:17:32.739 --> 00:17:37.292
detail, where you can again see
the entire pilaster behind the

00:17:37.292 --> 00:17:39.009
rusticated masonry.
 

00:17:39.009 --> 00:17:43.299
You see the finished capital,
the finished entablature up

00:17:43.299 --> 00:17:46.748
above,
and then you can make out the

00:17:46.748 --> 00:17:51.220
entire pilaster all the way down
to the base,

00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:53.548
and then superimposed,
or so it seems--

00:17:53.548 --> 00:17:56.618
it's not really superimposed,
it's just carved in this way--

00:17:56.618 --> 00:18:00.548
but in between those,
these rusticated blocks.

00:18:00.548 --> 00:18:04.054
Again giving me,
at least, the sense that the

00:18:04.054 --> 00:18:08.275
pilaster is done inside,
it's just waiting somehow for

00:18:08.275 --> 00:18:11.700
its debut out of this travertine
block.

00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:14.930
Now what about the rest of the
complex?

00:18:14.930 --> 00:18:18.797
We don't know exactly,
but we have some general sense

00:18:18.797 --> 00:18:23.334
that it is quite likely that it
was similar to the sanctuaries

00:18:23.334 --> 00:18:27.252
that we looked at earlier,
the Sanctuary of Jupiter Anxur

00:18:27.252 --> 00:18:32.038
at Terracina,
and Hercules at Tivoli.

00:18:32.038 --> 00:18:33.106
And, in fact,
we do have some fragments of

00:18:33.106 --> 00:18:34.410
this, on what is called the
Marble Plan of Rome.

00:18:34.410 --> 00:18:37.246
I've referred to that before,
the so-called Forma

00:18:37.246 --> 00:18:39.465
Urbis--
Forma Urbis,

00:18:39.465 --> 00:18:42.771
F-o-r-m-a, new word,
U-r-b-i-s, the Forma

00:18:42.771 --> 00:18:45.848
Urbis--which was a marble
plan of Rome,

00:18:45.848 --> 00:18:48.558
that was made in the early
third century A.D.,

00:18:48.558 --> 00:18:51.730
which was housed in a building
that I'm going to show you later

00:18:51.730 --> 00:18:52.140
today.
 

00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:55.585
And there are fragments of this
structure there that give us a

00:18:55.585 --> 00:18:58.069
sense of what it looked like in
antiquity.

00:18:58.069 --> 00:18:59.950
So we would've had the podium.
 

00:18:59.950 --> 00:19:02.433
It's mis-restored here;
you have to imagine the two

00:19:02.433 --> 00:19:05.450
tiers that we just looked at
before, not this sort of thing.

00:19:05.450 --> 00:19:08.660
But those beneath,
serving as the podium,

00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:11.723
or the decoration of the
podium, and then above a large

00:19:11.723 --> 00:19:15.252
rectangular space with a temple,
pushed not quite to the edge of

00:19:15.252 --> 00:19:18.094
the back wall,
but toward one of the walls,

00:19:18.094 --> 00:19:20.869
dominating the space in front
of it,

00:19:20.869 --> 00:19:21.980
as you can see.
 

00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:24.140
We don't know exactly what that
temple looked like,

00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:26.710
but it was probably a fairly
conventional temple,

00:19:26.710 --> 00:19:29.858
on the order of so many that
we've looked at this semester.

00:19:29.858 --> 00:19:33.213
What's interesting about this,
that's different from the other

00:19:33.213 --> 00:19:37.027
sanctuaries that we saw,
is that in the rectangular

00:19:37.027 --> 00:19:42.038
space above they seem to have
planted a lot of bushes,

00:19:42.038 --> 00:19:45.090
as you can see here,
and that becomes a very popular

00:19:45.090 --> 00:19:49.098
way of decorating these kinds of
complexes in the Flavian period.

00:19:49.098 --> 00:19:52.858
We'll see another example later
today.

00:19:52.858 --> 00:19:57.125
The greatest,
the most famous building that

00:19:57.125 --> 00:20:01.536
was put up by Vespasian,
in the Flavian period,

00:20:01.536 --> 00:20:06.644
was the so-called Colosseum,
which he began in the year 70

00:20:06.644 --> 00:20:12.900
A.D.: so contemporaneous to the
construction of the Claudianum.

00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:16.880
But it wasn't finished until
after his death--he died in 79;

00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:20.124
he was emperor for nine years;
died of natural causes--it

00:20:20.124 --> 00:20:23.566
wasn't completed until his son
Titus became emperor,

00:20:23.566 --> 00:20:27.480
and Titus completed it and
dedicated it in the year 80.

00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:32.880
We see a view of the Colosseum
from above, a Google Earth image

00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:35.578
of the Colosseum,
from above.

00:20:35.578 --> 00:20:38.959
It was a very large
amphitheater that could hold

00:20:38.959 --> 00:20:40.108
50,000 people.
 

00:20:40.108 --> 00:20:43.460
It was made of concrete,
as we shall see.

00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:47.380
And this aerial view is very
helpful because it shows its

00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:48.640
scale, its size.
 

00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:52.098
It shows that in Rome today it
serves as a kind of giant

00:20:52.098 --> 00:20:54.490
traffic circle,
as you can see here.

00:20:54.490 --> 00:20:57.758
The Romans love the Colosseum,
because it is an icon of their

00:20:57.758 --> 00:21:00.520
civilization,
but at the same time they hate

00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:03.608
it, and they're always saying,
"Would that we could just

00:21:03.608 --> 00:21:05.490
get rid of it,
so that traffic would be

00:21:05.490 --> 00:21:07.509
smoother in this part of
Rome."

00:21:07.509 --> 00:21:09.644
And, in fact,
there was a scheme a number of

00:21:09.644 --> 00:21:12.692
years ago now--
probably several decades ago by

00:21:12.692 --> 00:21:14.968
now--
there was a Texan who was

00:21:14.968 --> 00:21:19.479
actually interested in buying
the Colosseum and bringing it to

00:21:19.479 --> 00:21:21.920
Texas &gt;
 

00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:23.838
to display on his ranch.
 

00:21:23.838 --> 00:21:30.009
And fortunately--Italy gave
some thought to that,

00:21:30.009 --> 00:21:32.364
but they decided obviously that
they were not going to part with

00:21:32.364 --> 00:21:34.678
the Colosseum--
and fortunately it has stayed

00:21:34.678 --> 00:21:36.586
intact--
and I don't think the Romans

00:21:36.586 --> 00:21:38.519
would have been too happy about
that,

00:21:38.519 --> 00:21:41.480
at the end of the day,
despite the fact that they

00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:44.009
curse it out on a fairly regular
basis.

00:21:44.009 --> 00:21:46.189
But we see it here,
and it's a useful view because

00:21:46.189 --> 00:21:48.991
it shows it in conjunction to so
many of the other buildings and

00:21:48.991 --> 00:21:51.750
complexes we've been talking
about thus far this semester.

00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:54.102
We're looking back from it,
toward the later Arch of

00:21:54.102 --> 00:21:57.098
Constantine, that we'll look at,
at the very end of the course;

00:21:57.098 --> 00:21:59.048
the Palatine Hill in the upper
left;

00:21:59.048 --> 00:22:02.839
the Roman Forum beginning over
here, with the Temple of Venus

00:22:02.839 --> 00:22:05.808
and Roma that was done in the
second century;

00:22:05.808 --> 00:22:07.890
we'll talk about that also
later.

00:22:07.890 --> 00:22:12.750
Here the great Via dei Fori
Imperiali, designed at the

00:22:12.750 --> 00:22:14.769
behest of Mussolini.
 

00:22:14.769 --> 00:22:17.400
And on the right side,
of course, the Imperial Fora,

00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:21.236
with the Forum of Julius Caesar
and the Forum of Augustus that

00:22:21.236 --> 00:22:23.690
we have also looked at this
semester.

00:22:23.690 --> 00:22:26.509
So here you see it here.
 

00:22:26.509 --> 00:22:32.170
And I'm going to show you once
again the site plan of Nero.

00:22:32.170 --> 00:22:35.228
Because it's important to
know--one of the most important

00:22:35.228 --> 00:22:38.450
things to know about this
monument is where it was sited.

00:22:38.450 --> 00:22:42.560
And where it was sited shows us
again how incredibly shrewd

00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:47.170
Vespasian was when it came to
establishing a political agenda,

00:22:47.170 --> 00:22:51.298
and when it came to trying to
court the favor of the public.

00:22:51.298 --> 00:22:55.798
He decided to raze--I mentioned
this before--

00:22:55.798 --> 00:22:59.788
he razed to the ground Nero's
Domus Aurea: destroyed it,

00:22:59.788 --> 00:23:01.982
destroyed it,
despite the fact that it had

00:23:01.982 --> 00:23:04.068
been done by these great
architects,

00:23:04.068 --> 00:23:06.240
despite the fact that it had
revolving ceilings.

00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:09.214
It would've been a really cool
place for him to live

00:23:09.214 --> 00:23:11.900
himself--think about it--he and
his dynasty.

00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:14.387
But he decided to raze it to
the ground, for political

00:23:14.387 --> 00:23:18.029
reasons, to discredit Nero;
and he hoped to gain favor with

00:23:18.029 --> 00:23:19.058
the populace.
 

00:23:19.058 --> 00:23:20.884
And what he did,
smartly, was to say,

00:23:20.884 --> 00:23:23.368
"What I am going to do
with this property?

00:23:23.368 --> 00:23:27.048
I'm going to return this
property to the Roman people.

00:23:27.048 --> 00:23:29.653
I'm going to build on it
something that they would really

00:23:29.653 --> 00:23:30.630
like to have."
 

00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:34.633
So what he does is he fills in
the artificial lake,

00:23:34.633 --> 00:23:38.796
and he uses the area on which
the artificial lake was

00:23:38.796 --> 00:23:42.480
originally located to build the
Colosseum;

00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:47.413
he puts the Colosseum right on
the location of the artificial

00:23:47.413 --> 00:23:47.990
lake.
 

00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:49.460
And the message is clear.
 

00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:52.930
What did the Roman people want
more than anything else?

00:23:52.930 --> 00:23:56.019
They wanted another--they
wanted an amphitheater where

00:23:56.019 --> 00:23:58.074
they could go,
a large amphitheater,

00:23:58.074 --> 00:24:00.813
where 50,000 of them could pack
in and watch animal and

00:24:00.813 --> 00:24:02.028
gladiatorial combats.
 

00:24:02.028 --> 00:24:05.152
There is no better way to gain
favor with the Roman populace

00:24:05.152 --> 00:24:07.108
than to build a building like
this.

00:24:07.108 --> 00:24:10.763
And to build it on top of
Nero's pleasurable artificial

00:24:10.763 --> 00:24:14.621
lake--pleasurable only for
himself--was a huge coup on the

00:24:14.621 --> 00:24:16.108
part of Vespasian.
 

00:24:16.108 --> 00:24:20.371
And we see that happening here,
and right in proximity to the

00:24:20.371 --> 00:24:22.358
Temple of Divine Claudius.
 

00:24:22.358 --> 00:24:25.796
Notice the fact also,
the location of the Colosseum,

00:24:25.796 --> 00:24:27.750
very close to the Colossus.
 

00:24:27.750 --> 00:24:32.824
The name of the Colosseum was
really the Flavian Amphitheater,

00:24:32.824 --> 00:24:37.650
after the family name Flavius,
the Flavian Amphitheater.

00:24:37.650 --> 00:24:39.400
That's how it was known in
antiquity.

00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:43.980
But it came quickly to be known
as the Colosseum,

00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:47.388
not because of its colossal
scale, which is what most people

00:24:47.388 --> 00:24:50.170
think,
but because of the Colossus,

00:24:50.170 --> 00:24:54.529
because of the statue of
Zenodorus that stood nearby.

00:24:54.529 --> 00:24:57.304
And, by the way,
the other thing that Vespasian

00:24:57.304 --> 00:25:00.140
did was to have the features of
Nero erased,

00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:03.596
on that portrait,
and to make them into the more

00:25:03.596 --> 00:25:06.980
generic features of the sun god
Sol himself.

00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:10.330
So the statue continued to
stand, but it was fixed up,

00:25:10.330 --> 00:25:13.048
it was redone,
remade, so that it would look

00:25:13.048 --> 00:25:15.009
like Sol and not like Nero.
 

00:25:15.009 --> 00:25:17.848
But again the Colosseum takes
its name from that.

00:25:17.848 --> 00:25:20.078
So if you are in any--we used
to have a Colosseum here,

00:25:20.078 --> 00:25:25.170
in New Haven--but if you are,
in the future,

00:25:25.170 --> 00:25:27.390
in any arenas that are called
Colosseums,

00:25:27.390 --> 00:25:32.368
you'll know that that name goes
back to the Colossus of Nero,

00:25:32.368 --> 00:25:35.626
the Colossus of Sol,
not to the Colosseum itself,

00:25:35.626 --> 00:25:36.509
ultimately.
 

00:25:36.509 --> 00:25:39.759
Although I think those who
named those arenas were

00:25:39.759 --> 00:25:43.009
obviously thinking about the
Colosseum in Rome.

00:25:43.009 --> 00:25:45.963
So the location of the
Colosseum, extremely important,

00:25:45.963 --> 00:25:48.640
and a political statement on
Vespasian's part.

00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:52.794
And we see this man,
this emperor of Rome,

00:25:52.794 --> 00:25:58.973
Vespasian, very cleverly using
architecture to further his own

00:25:58.973 --> 00:26:02.420
personal and political agenda.
 

00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:06.574
This view, also this plan--a
cross-section and axonometric

00:26:06.574 --> 00:26:09.490
view that all come from
Ward-Perkins--

00:26:09.490 --> 00:26:12.857
are also very helpful in us
getting a sense of this

00:26:12.857 --> 00:26:13.598
building.
 

00:26:13.598 --> 00:26:15.989
And I think you can see very
quickly that,

00:26:15.989 --> 00:26:19.484
like all other amphitheaters,
it had an oval or an elliptical

00:26:19.484 --> 00:26:20.009
plan.
 

00:26:20.009 --> 00:26:24.192
It was built up with concrete:
a series of barrel and annular

00:26:24.192 --> 00:26:24.818
vaults.
 

00:26:24.818 --> 00:26:30.355
And that elliptical plan
included essentially radiating

00:26:30.355 --> 00:26:34.105
barrel vaults that--
barrel vaulted ramps and

00:26:34.105 --> 00:26:37.227
passageways,
and a series of annular vaulted

00:26:37.227 --> 00:26:41.142
corridors that provide lateral
circulation and that are

00:26:41.142 --> 00:26:44.259
buttressed by the thrust of the
seating.

00:26:44.259 --> 00:26:48.855
So it's a scheme that we know
already from the Amphitheater at

00:26:48.855 --> 00:26:49.608
Pompeii.
 

00:26:49.608 --> 00:26:52.635
We know it also particularly
well from the Theater of

00:26:52.635 --> 00:26:53.798
Marcellus in Rome.
 

00:26:53.798 --> 00:26:56.474
The Theater of Marcellus in
Rome was just down the street

00:26:56.474 --> 00:26:59.247
practically--I'll show you an
aerial view later to show you

00:26:59.247 --> 00:27:01.865
its proximity to the Colosseum;
it's not right next to it,

00:27:01.865 --> 00:27:03.140
but it's within striking
distance.

00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:07.396
And clearly the experiments,
the architectural experiments

00:27:07.396 --> 00:27:11.358
in the Augustan period,
at the Theater of Marcellus,

00:27:11.358 --> 00:27:15.400
were very important in terms of
this particular design;

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:19.048
it basically follows the same
general scheme.

00:27:19.048 --> 00:27:20.288
The major difference,
of course, is that since the

00:27:20.288 --> 00:27:21.250
Theater of Marcellus was a
theater,

00:27:21.250 --> 00:27:24.501
it was semi-circular in plan,
whereas amphitheater

00:27:24.501 --> 00:27:27.490
architecture is always
elliptical in plan,

00:27:27.490 --> 00:27:31.970
and that is the case also for
the Colosseum.

00:27:31.970 --> 00:27:36.611
If we look at the--I mentioned
that there are annular vaulted

00:27:36.611 --> 00:27:37.538
corridors.
 

00:27:37.538 --> 00:27:40.558
We're looking at the corridor
on the first floor of the

00:27:40.558 --> 00:27:41.230
Colosseum.
 

00:27:41.230 --> 00:27:44.288
And you can see very quickly
that it is of course made of

00:27:44.288 --> 00:27:44.890
concrete.
 

00:27:44.890 --> 00:27:47.789
How else would you get these
annular vaults that you see

00:27:47.789 --> 00:27:48.160
here?
 

00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:50.858
They're very well preserved;
they're easy to study.

00:27:50.858 --> 00:27:55.444
And you can see that those
annular vaults rest on great

00:27:55.444 --> 00:28:00.200
stone piers, these stone piers
made out of travertine.

00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:04.778
Again, you can see that
extremely well in this

00:28:04.778 --> 00:28:06.609
particular view.
 

00:28:06.609 --> 00:28:08.710
That's the first floor.
 

00:28:08.710 --> 00:28:11.701
On the second floor,
however, we see something

00:28:11.701 --> 00:28:15.092
entirely innovative,
and that is the introduction of

00:28:15.092 --> 00:28:18.548
a new form of vault that we
haven't seen before.

00:28:18.548 --> 00:28:23.291
This is the so-called groin or
ribbed vault--spelled exactly as

00:28:23.291 --> 00:28:25.970
you think it would be,
g-r-o-i-n;

00:28:25.970 --> 00:28:27.690
the groin vault or the ribbed
vault.

00:28:27.690 --> 00:28:31.643
And you get--when you take two
barrel vaults and make them

00:28:31.643 --> 00:28:35.736
intersect, the angles that you
get create this kind of groin

00:28:35.736 --> 00:28:38.487
vault;
and I show you a diagram here,

00:28:38.487 --> 00:28:41.298
which makes that clear,
I think, to you.

00:28:41.298 --> 00:28:44.108
And then a view of the second
story corridors,

00:28:44.108 --> 00:28:47.440
to show you these actual groin
vaults,

00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:49.240
these ribbed vaults that you
see here,

00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:52.069
which are very interesting and
add something,

00:28:52.069 --> 00:28:55.029
I think, to these structures.
 

00:28:55.029 --> 00:28:57.140
And they become very,
very popular.

00:28:57.140 --> 00:29:00.262
After they begin to be used in
the Flavian period,

00:29:00.262 --> 00:29:03.833
they become very popular,
and we'll see the proliferation

00:29:03.833 --> 00:29:06.318
of groin vaults,
from this time on.

00:29:06.318 --> 00:29:10.971
So we talk--I talked at the
beginning about what are the

00:29:10.971 --> 00:29:15.369
innovations of Nero's Domus
Aurea continued under the

00:29:15.369 --> 00:29:16.470
Flavians?
 

00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:20.093
Well we know that the
architects of Nero did not use

00:29:20.093 --> 00:29:22.673
groin vaults,
but they were very interested

00:29:22.673 --> 00:29:26.008
in the free flow of space,
and that interest in the free

00:29:26.008 --> 00:29:31.654
flow of space continues here,
as does experimentation with

00:29:31.654 --> 00:29:34.621
concrete,
and we see it in the use of

00:29:34.621 --> 00:29:38.380
these groin vaults on the second
story of the Colosseum in Rome.

00:29:38.380 --> 00:29:41.605
When you visit the Colosseum in
Rome today, you'll note that it

00:29:41.605 --> 00:29:44.048
does seem quite stripped bare,
unfortunately.

00:29:44.048 --> 00:29:47.781
But it's important for you to
be aware of the fact that it too

00:29:47.781 --> 00:29:50.413
was highly decorated,
as so many other Roman

00:29:50.413 --> 00:29:51.269
buildings.
 

00:29:51.269 --> 00:29:53.259
And we do have engravings that
were made,

00:29:53.259 --> 00:29:56.614
engravings and paintings,
that were made when the

00:29:56.614 --> 00:29:59.200
Colosseum was in better
condition,

00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:02.898
and when some of that stucco
and painted decoration still

00:30:02.898 --> 00:30:03.558
existed.
 

00:30:03.558 --> 00:30:06.976
And I show you two drawings
here that give you some sense of

00:30:06.976 --> 00:30:09.133
that,
and you can see that all the

00:30:09.133 --> 00:30:12.439
surface was covered with stucco,
and then with figural

00:30:12.439 --> 00:30:14.759
decoration, all of which was
painted,

00:30:14.759 --> 00:30:18.720
both the vaults themselves,
as you can see above,

00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:23.490
and the corridors,
all of that very elaborately

00:30:23.490 --> 00:30:27.118
decorated in ancient Roman
times.

00:30:27.118 --> 00:30:31.048
This is obviously an exterior
view of the Colosseum in Rome.

00:30:31.048 --> 00:30:34.720
The exterior of the building is
actually quite well preserved,

00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:39.268
and I think as you gaze at it,
you certainly are struck by the

00:30:39.268 --> 00:30:43.368
similarity of the scheme to the
scheme of the Theater of

00:30:43.368 --> 00:30:45.009
Marcellus in Rome.
 

00:30:45.009 --> 00:30:46.363
In this case,
the Theater of Marcellus

00:30:46.363 --> 00:30:48.375
appears to have had three
stories, only two of which are

00:30:48.375 --> 00:30:49.288
currently persevered.
 

00:30:49.288 --> 00:30:52.650
This had four stories,
four tiers, as you can see

00:30:52.650 --> 00:30:53.140
here.
 

00:30:53.140 --> 00:30:56.119
Again, the structure itself is
concrete;

00:30:56.119 --> 00:30:57.670
the facing is travertine.
 

00:30:57.670 --> 00:31:00.625
We see these great arches,
these great arcades,

00:31:00.625 --> 00:31:03.838
just as we saw them in the
Theater of Marcellus.

00:31:03.838 --> 00:31:06.505
And then also,
just like the scheme of the

00:31:06.505 --> 00:31:09.558
Theater of Marcellus,
columns that are placed in

00:31:09.558 --> 00:31:12.940
between those arches on the
first three stories.

00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:17.643
The columns in between those
arches on the first three

00:31:17.643 --> 00:31:22.968
stories, just as the Theater of
Marcellus, have no structural

00:31:22.968 --> 00:31:25.009
purpose whatsoever.
 

00:31:25.009 --> 00:31:27.576
They do not hold the building
up, as they would have in a

00:31:27.576 --> 00:31:28.858
Greek or Etruscan context.
 

00:31:28.858 --> 00:31:34.183
The building is held up by the
barrel and annular vaults that

00:31:34.183 --> 00:31:36.578
are made out of concrete.
 

00:31:36.578 --> 00:31:41.460
So these columns have no
structural purpose whatsoever,

00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:46.009
and they are here essentially
as the icing on the cake,

00:31:46.009 --> 00:31:49.645
as ornamentation or decoration,
but ornamentation or decoration

00:31:49.645 --> 00:31:52.871
that has certain meaning to it:
a meaning that certainly

00:31:52.871 --> 00:31:54.690
conjures up ancient Greece.
 

00:31:54.690 --> 00:31:58.028
Because you can see here that
they have used all the Greek

00:31:58.028 --> 00:32:01.348
orders: the Doric order,
the Ionic order in the second

00:32:01.348 --> 00:32:03.298
story,
the Corinthian order--all of

00:32:03.298 --> 00:32:06.172
these are engaged columns--
the Corinthian order in the

00:32:06.172 --> 00:32:08.836
third story,
and then in the fourth story we

00:32:08.836 --> 00:32:12.757
see they used pilasters;
these are Corinthian pilasters

00:32:12.757 --> 00:32:13.700
once again.
 

00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:17.211
So Doric, Ionic,
Corinthian, Corinthian again at

00:32:17.211 --> 00:32:21.006
the uppermost part;
columns that have no structure,

00:32:21.006 --> 00:32:25.098
that are used here as pure
decoration, but decoration that

00:32:25.098 --> 00:32:27.900
again has an ideological
connection.

00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:31.348
At the very top you can see the
detail of the pilasters.

00:32:31.348 --> 00:32:36.496
Between them you see some
travertine blocks that are

00:32:36.496 --> 00:32:39.118
brackets that stick out.
 

00:32:39.118 --> 00:32:41.644
Those were to support the
wooden poles that you'll

00:32:41.644 --> 00:32:44.480
remember from our conversation
about the Amphitheater at

00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:48.218
Pompeii,
supported the awning that was

00:32:48.218 --> 00:32:50.970
used when there was rain.
 

00:32:50.970 --> 00:32:54.690
Two more views of the exterior
of the Colosseum,

00:32:54.690 --> 00:32:57.496
a little bit closer up,
where you can see very well

00:32:57.496 --> 00:32:59.910
here the Doric order in the
first story,

00:32:59.910 --> 00:33:03.394
the travertine facing,
the Ionic order in the second

00:33:03.394 --> 00:33:06.435
story,
and then the Corinthian engaged

00:33:06.435 --> 00:33:09.578
columns here,
and the Corinthian pilasters,

00:33:09.578 --> 00:33:14.912
and then also the brackets,
extremely well preserved,

00:33:14.912 --> 00:33:18.410
on the Colosseum in Rome.
 

00:33:18.410 --> 00:33:20.960
The interior is a different
story entirely.

00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:23.650
It is not as well preserved as
the exterior.

00:33:23.650 --> 00:33:26.160
It is fascinating however to
see.

00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:30.762
And I think you can tell from
this particular view of the

00:33:30.762 --> 00:33:34.214
interior, where,
as always, we have so many

00:33:34.214 --> 00:33:37.009
tourists inside the Colosseum.
 

00:33:37.009 --> 00:33:40.816
I think they are very useful
because they give you a very

00:33:40.816 --> 00:33:43.942
good sense of scale,
of how truly enormous this

00:33:43.942 --> 00:33:45.029
building is.
 

00:33:45.029 --> 00:33:48.096
They also show you that much of
what was once there is no longer

00:33:48.096 --> 00:33:50.140
there, in the interior of the
structure.

00:33:50.140 --> 00:33:54.714
As we look down on it,
we can see the elliptical shape

00:33:54.714 --> 00:33:56.009
of the arena.
 

00:33:56.009 --> 00:33:57.788
We can see the substructures
here, all made of concrete.

00:33:57.788 --> 00:34:02.757
The ones that are below the
arena itself were used for the

00:34:02.757 --> 00:34:06.928
storage of props,
but also for the housing of the

00:34:06.928 --> 00:34:10.690
animals that were brought up for
animal combat.

00:34:10.690 --> 00:34:13.402
There were small and larger
cages down here,

00:34:13.402 --> 00:34:17.380
and I'm going to show you what
those looked like in a moment.

00:34:17.380 --> 00:34:20.914
So that's the location of
those, but again not in very

00:34:20.914 --> 00:34:22.449
good condition today.
 

00:34:22.449 --> 00:34:27.077
Even more striking is the fact
that although you can see again

00:34:27.077 --> 00:34:31.023
the concrete substructures for
the seats on which the

00:34:31.023 --> 00:34:34.512
cavea rested,
if you look very carefully you

00:34:34.512 --> 00:34:37.536
will see there's only a single
cuneus that is still

00:34:37.536 --> 00:34:41.639
preserved,
with a small number of marble

00:34:41.639 --> 00:34:42.449
seats.
 

00:34:42.449 --> 00:34:46.030
The whole thing was sheathed in
marble in antiquity.

00:34:46.030 --> 00:34:49.050
All of the seats would have
been marble.

00:34:49.050 --> 00:34:51.375
Only that small section is
preserved, and I can show you

00:34:51.375 --> 00:34:52.940
another view where we see the
same.

00:34:52.940 --> 00:34:55.869
Here we're looking at that one
cuneus over here,

00:34:55.869 --> 00:34:59.907
with that one set of marble
seats, the only marble seats

00:34:59.907 --> 00:35:03.579
that are still preserved in the
Colosseum today.

00:35:03.579 --> 00:35:04.920
"Why is that?"
 

00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:07.460
you ask yourselves,
and you might ask me.

00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:13.679
The reason for that is that the
Colosseum was used as a marble

00:35:13.679 --> 00:35:17.360
quarry,
practically from the time--not

00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:21.112
too long after it was built,
but certainly in the

00:35:21.112 --> 00:35:24.443
post-antique period it was used
very significantly as a marble

00:35:24.443 --> 00:35:24.989
quarry.
 

00:35:24.989 --> 00:35:25.929
By whom?
 

00:35:25.929 --> 00:35:28.750
By the great princes and even
by the popes;

00:35:28.750 --> 00:35:32.137
the popes did not hesitate to
plunge the Colosseum for the

00:35:32.137 --> 00:35:35.880
marble that they needed for the
buildings that they were putting

00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:37.010
up around Rome.
 

00:35:37.010 --> 00:35:39.550
The Colosseum ended up in some
extraordinary buildings.

00:35:39.550 --> 00:35:44.074
So it was not for naught,
but at the same time obviously

00:35:44.074 --> 00:35:48.268
it changed the face of the
interior of the Colosseum

00:35:48.268 --> 00:35:51.559
forever, as we can see so well
here.

00:35:51.559 --> 00:35:55.862
Two models of what the
substructures would have looked

00:35:55.862 --> 00:36:00.329
like in the area of the
Colosseum where the animals were

00:36:00.329 --> 00:36:01.059
kept.
 

00:36:01.059 --> 00:36:06.300
And they had a system of ramps
and pulleys, and they took the

00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:11.630
animals either up the ramps or
by pulley, from these cages.

00:36:11.630 --> 00:36:14.018
You can see they had metal
grills in front of them.

00:36:14.018 --> 00:36:18.262
Diverse animals,
kept down here below and then

00:36:18.262 --> 00:36:22.597
brought up when needed,
through openings in the

00:36:22.597 --> 00:36:25.050
pavement of the arena.
 

00:36:25.050 --> 00:36:28.019
The arena would have been paved
with concrete--we have other

00:36:28.019 --> 00:36:31.144
examples of that elsewhere;
I'm going to show you one

00:36:31.144 --> 00:36:34.208
today--and there would have been
holes in that,

00:36:34.208 --> 00:36:37.940
by which you could bring the
animals up to the arena.

00:36:37.940 --> 00:36:41.409
This is a restored view of what
the Colosseum would have--

00:36:41.409 --> 00:36:45.322
the interior of the Colosseum
would have looked like in

00:36:45.322 --> 00:36:47.929
antiquity when a performance
was--

00:36:47.929 --> 00:36:50.039
when a gladiatorial performance
was taking place.

00:36:50.039 --> 00:36:53.664
We see that what they did was
they covered over the arena with

00:36:53.664 --> 00:36:56.280
some kind of ancient version of
Astroturf.

00:36:56.280 --> 00:37:00.447
They planted--they put trees
that they probably--I don't

00:37:00.447 --> 00:37:04.010
know, real or fake trees,
I'm not sure which;

00:37:04.010 --> 00:37:06.730
props that took the shape of
mountains, as you can see here;

00:37:06.730 --> 00:37:10.715
and then the gladiatorial--the
animal combat would take place

00:37:10.715 --> 00:37:12.309
against that backdrop.
 

00:37:12.309 --> 00:37:14.840
You can also see the seats,
the cavea,

00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:18.349
the wedge-shaped sections of
those seats, the cunei;

00:37:18.349 --> 00:37:22.659
the 50,000 people packed in for
this special event.

00:37:22.659 --> 00:37:25.443
And then at the uppermost part
you see the awning,

00:37:25.443 --> 00:37:28.510
or this particular artist's
rendition of the awning.

00:37:28.510 --> 00:37:31.621
I think it's very amusing that
the artist has rendered it like

00:37:31.621 --> 00:37:33.969
an oculus,
which is pretty unlikely that

00:37:33.969 --> 00:37:36.909
it looked quite like that;
but I guess that's a very Roman

00:37:36.909 --> 00:37:38.230
thing to do, so he did that.
 

00:37:38.230 --> 00:37:42.172
But it looks probably in
antiquity quite a bit more like

00:37:42.172 --> 00:37:45.971
the awning that we saw in the
painting in Pompeii that

00:37:45.971 --> 00:37:50.630
represented a characteristic
awning for a Roman amphitheater.

00:37:50.630 --> 00:37:53.030
The Colosseum,
extremely famous in its own

00:37:53.030 --> 00:37:55.550
day, continued to be famous in
antiquity.

00:37:55.550 --> 00:38:00.273
I show you here a coin,
the reverse of a coin of a boy

00:38:00.273 --> 00:38:03.659
emperor by the name of Gordian
III--

00:38:03.659 --> 00:38:07.635
you see Gordian up there--the
reverse of his coin in the early

00:38:07.635 --> 00:38:10.699
third century A.D.,
showing the Colosseum.

00:38:10.699 --> 00:38:13.402
So we certainly know from that,
that it was still in good

00:38:13.402 --> 00:38:15.719
condition and being used in the
third century.

00:38:15.719 --> 00:38:18.559
We see the outside,
with its tiers of columns.

00:38:18.559 --> 00:38:21.219
We see something,
an event going on inside.

00:38:21.219 --> 00:38:24.860
We see people in the seats,
and we see those poles that

00:38:24.860 --> 00:38:26.750
supported the awning here.
 

00:38:26.750 --> 00:38:31.010
And, most interestingly,
we see the Colossus,

00:38:31.010 --> 00:38:33.800
which was clearly still
standing also in the third

00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:35.963
century A.D.:
the Colossus in which the

00:38:35.963 --> 00:38:39.780
features have been changed from
those of Nero to those of Sol,

00:38:39.780 --> 00:38:41.590
with the rayed crown.
 

00:38:41.590 --> 00:38:44.172
It was very easy to do that
because, as I had mentioned,

00:38:44.172 --> 00:38:46.286
Nero had been shown originally
himself as Sol,

00:38:46.286 --> 00:38:47.460
with the rayed crown.
 

00:38:47.460 --> 00:38:50.320
So all they had to do was
change the features of the face.

00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:55.018
They could leave the crown,
and that crown clearly still

00:38:55.018 --> 00:38:58.010
there, in the third century
A.D..

00:38:58.010 --> 00:39:00.652
But just again as a reminder
that the Colosseum gets its name

00:39:00.652 --> 00:39:02.809
from that colossal statue that
stood next door.

00:39:02.809 --> 00:39:05.730
And this one last view of the
Colosseum.

00:39:05.730 --> 00:39:09.460
This is a model--which you have
on your Monument List--

00:39:09.460 --> 00:39:13.108
a model that probably gives you
as good an idea as any of what

00:39:13.108 --> 00:39:16.460
the exterior of the building
looked like in antiquity.

00:39:16.460 --> 00:39:19.199
And I use it here to show you
two things.

00:39:19.199 --> 00:39:22.226
One: That we do believe,
on the second and third

00:39:22.226 --> 00:39:25.768
stories, there were statues;
statues placed in the niches

00:39:25.768 --> 00:39:26.920
beneath the arches.
 

00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:30.617
And this also shows you very
well the way in which the wooden

00:39:30.617 --> 00:39:35.405
poles rested on the brackets,
those wooden poles to serve to

00:39:35.405 --> 00:39:38.880
support the awning of the
structure.

00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:43.530
Anything and everything goes on
at the Colosseum.

00:39:43.530 --> 00:39:47.364
When I started going to the
Colosseum more years ago than I

00:39:47.364 --> 00:39:51.000
want to say, the Colosseum was
very easy to get into.

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:53.036
You popped over there,
you could walk in,

00:39:53.036 --> 00:39:54.760
in a flash;
never a problem.

00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:57.300
It's become one of the greatest
tourist sites in Rome.

00:39:57.300 --> 00:39:59.648
And, in fact,
a warning, if you're going to

00:39:59.648 --> 00:40:02.375
be making your way--
I think at least one of you

00:40:02.375 --> 00:40:04.480
mentioned to me a Spring Break
trip--

00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:06.197
but if you're going to be
making your way to the Colosseum

00:40:06.197 --> 00:40:07.735
anytime soon,
or in the future,

00:40:07.735 --> 00:40:10.409
it's actually not a bad idea to
go online;

00:40:10.409 --> 00:40:13.324
you can now go online and you
can get tickets online for

00:40:13.324 --> 00:40:14.809
places like the Colosseum.
 

00:40:14.809 --> 00:40:15.929
You don't need it for most
places,

00:40:15.929 --> 00:40:17.840
but for the Vatican,
the Colosseum,

00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:20.657
the most popular,
it's not a bad idea to get

00:40:20.657 --> 00:40:23.286
tickets in advance,
because then you can go on the

00:40:23.286 --> 00:40:25.257
short line,
instead of the line that you're

00:40:25.257 --> 00:40:27.280
going to have to wait for hours
to get in.

00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:29.304
But while you're outside,
there's always something going

00:40:29.304 --> 00:40:29.489
on.
 

00:40:29.489 --> 00:40:33.952
This also never used to happen,
but recently the Romans have

00:40:33.952 --> 00:40:38.719
gotten smart about realizing
that everyone wants a photo op,

00:40:38.719 --> 00:40:42.509
and so they supply a host of
gladiators outside the

00:40:42.509 --> 00:40:43.570
entranceway.
 

00:40:43.570 --> 00:40:46.603
And especially since everyone
is on line for so many hours,

00:40:46.603 --> 00:40:48.750
you might as well have
something to do.

00:40:48.750 --> 00:40:51.463
So they stock the place with
modern gladiators,

00:40:51.463 --> 00:40:54.768
who are more than willing,
for a certain number of euros,

00:40:54.768 --> 00:40:56.480
to pose in your pictures.
 

00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:59.313
And you see a young woman here
taking her boyfriend or her

00:40:59.313 --> 00:41:01.798
husband,
whomever, a picture of him

00:41:01.798 --> 00:41:05.380
playing the gladiatorial role
with this sword,

00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:06.599
as you can see.
 

00:41:06.599 --> 00:41:09.777
And lots of fun--it's fun just
to stand there and watch

00:41:09.777 --> 00:41:12.840
everybody posing for these
extraordinary pictures.

00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:18.168
We saw that in the Colosseum
the substructures were very

00:41:18.168 --> 00:41:20.010
poorly preserved.
 

00:41:20.010 --> 00:41:22.474
And so I wanted to show you
another amphitheater where they

00:41:22.474 --> 00:41:25.050
are well preserved,
so you can get a better sense

00:41:25.050 --> 00:41:27.994
of what those substructures
would have looked like in

00:41:27.994 --> 00:41:28.730
antiquity.
 

00:41:28.730 --> 00:41:32.210
And so I take us,
back south, we go down south to

00:41:32.210 --> 00:41:36.103
Campania once again,
to a place called Pozzuoli--and

00:41:36.103 --> 00:41:39.873
Pozzuoli is very near to Baia,
and near to Naples,

00:41:39.873 --> 00:41:43.599
and near to Pompeii and
Herculaneum and so on--

00:41:43.599 --> 00:41:48.385
a town that has one of the best
preserved Roman amphitheaters

00:41:48.385 --> 00:41:50.860
from the ancient Roman world.
 

00:41:50.860 --> 00:41:53.880
It dates to the late first
century A.D.

00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:57.650
And I show you a view here of
the substructures of the

00:41:57.650 --> 00:42:00.355
amphitheater,
the Roman Amphitheater at

00:42:00.355 --> 00:42:01.280
Pozzuoli.
 

00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:06.148
And you can see what I mean:
the annular vaulted corridors

00:42:06.148 --> 00:42:10.929
down below, well preserved,
as are the cages in which the

00:42:10.929 --> 00:42:13.920
animals were kept in antiquity.
 

00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:18.516
The grates are gone,
but the cages are still there,

00:42:18.516 --> 00:42:21.090
as is much of the ceiling.
 

00:42:21.090 --> 00:42:23.559
And it's actually a fun place
to wander through,

00:42:23.559 --> 00:42:25.820
because the light effects are
incredible;

00:42:25.820 --> 00:42:28.739
the light effects through the
openings in that ceiling,

00:42:28.739 --> 00:42:32.007
that were the openings through
which the animals were

00:42:32.007 --> 00:42:34.490
transported,
by ramp or by pulley,

00:42:34.490 --> 00:42:35.739
up to the arena.
 

00:42:35.739 --> 00:42:39.849
Here's another view where you
can also get a great sense of

00:42:39.849 --> 00:42:42.956
these substructures,
of the places where the animals

00:42:42.956 --> 00:42:45.255
were kept,
and also of those openings in

00:42:45.255 --> 00:42:48.469
the ceiling that allowed them to
be brought up above.

00:42:48.469 --> 00:42:51.211
And you can also notice very
well here the fact that the

00:42:51.211 --> 00:42:52.900
construction--
in this case,

00:42:52.900 --> 00:42:56.746
late first century A.D.--
is concrete faced with brick,

00:42:56.746 --> 00:42:58.030
faced with brick.
 

00:42:58.030 --> 00:43:01.119
And we talked about another
important part of Nero's

00:43:01.119 --> 00:43:04.817
architectural revolution was the
fact that they began to build

00:43:04.817 --> 00:43:08.150
buildings that were brick-faced
concrete buildings.

00:43:08.150 --> 00:43:10.219
We talked about the fact that
that had to do with the fire,

00:43:10.219 --> 00:43:13.510
and the decision taken that
brick was more fireproof than

00:43:13.510 --> 00:43:16.266
stone,
and they began to use it,

00:43:16.266 --> 00:43:19.030
and we see it being used here.
 

00:43:19.030 --> 00:43:23.943
So another important facet of
Nero's architectural revolution

00:43:23.943 --> 00:43:27.630
that was not lost with the
emperor's death.

00:43:27.630 --> 00:43:32.496
And here you can see the very
well-preserved pavement of the

00:43:32.496 --> 00:43:34.402
arena,
done in concrete,

00:43:34.402 --> 00:43:37.690
with these openings in it,
the same openings that you saw

00:43:37.690 --> 00:43:39.202
just before,
from down below,

00:43:39.202 --> 00:43:40.840
through which the light came.
 

00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:43.768
These are the openings through
which props, animals--some of

00:43:43.768 --> 00:43:46.956
them are very small;
some of them are larger--would

00:43:46.956 --> 00:43:50.380
allow some things to be brought
up through them.

00:43:50.380 --> 00:43:53.672
But you can also see there was
a big open area in the center

00:43:53.672 --> 00:43:55.750
that was also used--
covered over,

00:43:55.750 --> 00:43:59.418
when there was an event--
but that was also there in

00:43:59.418 --> 00:44:04.255
order to allow a freer flow,
and allow the attendants to

00:44:04.255 --> 00:44:07.389
bring the animals up to the top.
 

00:44:07.389 --> 00:44:11.179
So again, a very well-preserved
pavement of the arena.

00:44:11.179 --> 00:44:13.755
And you can also see in this
view that the seats,

00:44:13.755 --> 00:44:17.137
the cavea of the Theater
at Pozzuoli, also extremely well

00:44:17.137 --> 00:44:17.889
preserved.
 

00:44:17.889 --> 00:44:20.356
You can't tell here,
but the division into

00:44:20.356 --> 00:44:21.800
cunei the same.
 

00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:25.588
So we look to this amphitheater
to give us a better sense of

00:44:25.588 --> 00:44:29.184
what the interior of the
Colosseum would have looked like

00:44:29.184 --> 00:44:30.920
in ancient Roman times.
 

00:44:30.920 --> 00:44:34.670
We talked about the Temple of
Divine Claudius.

00:44:34.670 --> 00:44:37.909
I remind you of a model of it
here again,

00:44:37.909 --> 00:44:41.478
and the relationship of that
Temple of Divine Claudius with

00:44:41.478 --> 00:44:43.672
the temple,
conventional temple,

00:44:43.672 --> 00:44:45.670
on top of a very tall podium.
 

00:44:45.670 --> 00:44:48.615
The fact that that looked back
to the architectural

00:44:48.615 --> 00:44:50.445
experiments,
very early on,

00:44:50.445 --> 00:44:54.570
second, first centuries B.C.,
at the Sanctuaries of Jupiter

00:44:54.570 --> 00:44:58.599
Anxur at Terracina,
and of Hercules Victor at

00:44:58.599 --> 00:45:01.262
Tivoli;
it was that kind of thing that

00:45:01.262 --> 00:45:02.860
was being looked back to.
 

00:45:02.860 --> 00:45:06.400
And it's interesting to see
that it was that same plan,

00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:09.329
that idea of a great open
rectangular space,

00:45:09.329 --> 00:45:11.670
with a temple as part of it,
that was used--

00:45:11.670 --> 00:45:15.699
and with the temple put along
one of the longer ends--

00:45:15.699 --> 00:45:20.429
that was used by Vespasian for
his own forum in Rome,

00:45:20.429 --> 00:45:23.909
the so-called Forum Pacis;
it's sometimes referred to as

00:45:23.909 --> 00:45:26.273
the Templum Pacis,
because we're not actually sure

00:45:26.273 --> 00:45:27.190
how it was used.
 

00:45:27.190 --> 00:45:31.255
We don't think it was actually
used as a typical forum with

00:45:31.255 --> 00:45:34.664
shops and a law court and so on,
but may have been used in a

00:45:34.664 --> 00:45:37.373
different way,
and I'll speak to that in a

00:45:37.373 --> 00:45:38.010
moment.
 

00:45:38.010 --> 00:45:40.409
So we don't quite know what to
call it, and we call it either

00:45:40.409 --> 00:45:41.969
the Forum Pacis or the Templum
Pacis.

00:45:41.969 --> 00:45:45.791
In order to see its location,
I show you this view of all of

00:45:45.791 --> 00:45:49.858
the Imperial Fora in Rome,
those fora that line the Via

00:45:49.858 --> 00:45:53.530
dei Fori Imperiali,
across from the Roman Forum.

00:45:53.530 --> 00:45:56.289
We've already looked at--here's
the tail-end,

00:45:56.289 --> 00:45:59.900
or the side of the Roman Forum
here,

00:45:59.900 --> 00:46:02.726
and right next to it,
two fora that we've already

00:46:02.726 --> 00:46:06.143
discussed: The Forum of Julius
Caesar and then the Forum of

00:46:06.143 --> 00:46:06.909
Augustus.
 

00:46:06.909 --> 00:46:08.809
Nothing else;
this wasn't there then;

00:46:08.809 --> 00:46:09.909
this wasn't there then.
 

00:46:09.909 --> 00:46:13.360
But Vespasian decides to build
a forum himself,

00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:16.809
in close proximity to the Forum
of Augustus.

00:46:16.809 --> 00:46:20.269
In fact, it's interesting to
see that it faces--the temple is

00:46:20.269 --> 00:46:23.500
actually on this end--so in a
sense it faces the Forum of

00:46:23.500 --> 00:46:24.250
Augustus.
 

00:46:24.250 --> 00:46:28.329
So another smart,
strategic move on the part--

00:46:28.329 --> 00:46:31.762
a smart political move on the
part of Vespasian to associate

00:46:31.762 --> 00:46:35.358
himself not just with Claudius,
a good emperor who was

00:46:35.358 --> 00:46:38.010
divinized, but also with
Augustus,

00:46:38.010 --> 00:46:41.039
the founder of the
Julio-Claudian dynasty and the

00:46:41.039 --> 00:46:44.005
first emperor of Rome:
so to build his structure

00:46:44.005 --> 00:46:47.318
facing that of Augustus'--
his temple--facing that of

00:46:47.318 --> 00:46:47.920
Augustus'.
 

00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:51.210
But you can see that he wants
to outdo Augustus,

00:46:51.210 --> 00:46:54.010
so he makes his larger than
Augustus'.

00:46:54.010 --> 00:46:57.579
This area here,
that's labeled as the Forum of

00:46:57.579 --> 00:47:00.989
Nerva, wasn't a forum at all,
at this point,

00:47:00.989 --> 00:47:05.750
it was a street called the
Argiletum--A-r-g-i-l-e-t-u-m.

00:47:05.750 --> 00:47:08.795
And that street,
the Argiletum--and you can see

00:47:08.795 --> 00:47:12.402
it labeled up there--
that street led into a part of

00:47:12.402 --> 00:47:14.159
Rome,
a residential area of Rome,

00:47:14.159 --> 00:47:18.960
that I've referred to before,
called the Subura, S-u-b-u-r-a.

00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:22.300
The Subura was again a place
where there were a lot of--I've

00:47:22.300 --> 00:47:25.291
mentioned it again;
there were there,

00:47:25.291 --> 00:47:29.579
a lot of apartment houses,
mostly made out of wood:

00:47:29.579 --> 00:47:32.880
rickety apartment houses that
were lived in by a large number

00:47:32.880 --> 00:47:34.840
of people,
with lesser means.

00:47:34.840 --> 00:47:40.010
And there were consequently
always fires there.

00:47:40.010 --> 00:47:42.485
And you'll remember that
Augustus' architects had to

00:47:42.485 --> 00:47:45.157
build that large precinct wall
out of peperino to

00:47:45.157 --> 00:47:48.021
protect the Temple of Mars Ultor
from the fires that used to

00:47:48.021 --> 00:47:50.110
break out all the time in the
Subura.

00:47:50.110 --> 00:47:54.329
So you have to imagine this as
a street, in between the Forum

00:47:54.329 --> 00:47:58.266
of Augustus and Vespasian's
Forum Pacis, in ancient Roman

00:47:58.266 --> 00:47:58.969
times.
 

00:47:58.969 --> 00:48:03.916
Also interesting is again the
plan: a rectangle with a temple

00:48:03.916 --> 00:48:08.039
on one end, dominating the space
in front of it.

00:48:08.039 --> 00:48:11.230
You can see that there are
columns all the way around.

00:48:11.230 --> 00:48:16.492
There are these alcoves that
open off the center space,

00:48:16.492 --> 00:48:21.268
and you can see they're
screened, from that center

00:48:21.268 --> 00:48:23.900
space, also by columns.
 

00:48:23.900 --> 00:48:27.063
We know that some exotic
materials were used here:

00:48:27.063 --> 00:48:30.679
marble that was brought from
other parts of the world.

00:48:30.679 --> 00:48:34.402
We saw that beginning already
under Nero -- bringing marble

00:48:34.402 --> 00:48:37.356
from Asia Minor and Africa and
Egypt and so on,

00:48:37.356 --> 00:48:38.768
for his buildings.
 

00:48:38.768 --> 00:48:40.900
That also continues under the
Flavians.

00:48:40.900 --> 00:48:44.559
So another Neronian innovation
that remains important.

00:48:44.559 --> 00:48:45.929
We see it here.
 

00:48:45.929 --> 00:48:48.619
We see red granite columns used
for the colonnade.

00:48:48.619 --> 00:48:53.038
We see yellow columns from
Africa, used for the columns

00:48:53.038 --> 00:48:57.130
that screen these alcoves from
the larger space.

00:48:57.130 --> 00:49:00.889
And then we see white marble
for the rest.

00:49:00.889 --> 00:49:06.023
So this combination of imported
marbles used for the Forum Pacis

00:49:06.023 --> 00:49:06.840
in Rome.
 

00:49:06.840 --> 00:49:09.090
The Forum Pacis no longer
survives.

00:49:09.090 --> 00:49:10.889
You can't see any of it today.
 

00:49:10.889 --> 00:49:14.574
We do know its location though,
and we do have a good sense of

00:49:14.574 --> 00:49:16.806
its plan,
once again from the so-called

00:49:16.806 --> 00:49:21.110
Forma Urbis,
from this marble map of Rome

00:49:21.110 --> 00:49:26.268
that has a few fragments of the
Forum Pacis.

00:49:26.268 --> 00:49:29.307
You can see one fragment here,
one fragment here,

00:49:29.307 --> 00:49:31.650
and then a third fragment up
there.

00:49:31.650 --> 00:49:34.353
And those fragments are enough,
when we look at those,

00:49:34.353 --> 00:49:36.804
study those and compare those
to other buildings,

00:49:36.804 --> 00:49:39.050
to allow a very accurate
reconstruction.

00:49:39.050 --> 00:49:41.690
It tells us the shape of the
temple,

00:49:41.690 --> 00:49:43.710
and it shows us,
without any question--

00:49:43.710 --> 00:49:46.530
because one of the fragments
includes lots of this--

00:49:46.530 --> 00:49:48.969
that this too,
like the Claudianum in Rome,

00:49:48.969 --> 00:49:53.179
had bushes, had bushes as a
kind of garden,

00:49:53.179 --> 00:49:55.849
that decorated the center of
the structure.

00:49:55.849 --> 00:49:59.596
So bringing the country,
in a sense, into the city,

00:49:59.596 --> 00:50:02.070
for these incredible complexes.
 

00:50:02.070 --> 00:50:04.900
This is a restored view--and
you see it also on your Monument

00:50:04.900 --> 00:50:07.449
List--of what the Forum Pacis
would have looked like in

00:50:07.449 --> 00:50:08.110
antiquity.
 

00:50:08.110 --> 00:50:11.434
A quite severe façade,
as it seems,

00:50:11.434 --> 00:50:14.030
with a number of entranceways.
 

00:50:14.030 --> 00:50:16.842
The temple pushed up--in fact,
not only pushed up against the

00:50:16.842 --> 00:50:19.329
back wall, but part of the
colonnade that flanks it on

00:50:19.329 --> 00:50:20.079
either side.
 

00:50:20.079 --> 00:50:22.389
You can see the red granite
columns.

00:50:22.389 --> 00:50:26.802
You can't see the yellow
columns that would have been

00:50:26.802 --> 00:50:31.469
further in, screening the
alcoves from the colonnade.

00:50:31.469 --> 00:50:35.880
You see an altar right in front
of the temple.

00:50:35.880 --> 00:50:39.876
You see the bushes that were
part of the plantings that made

00:50:39.876 --> 00:50:44.280
this look like a kind of garden
complex in front of the temple.

00:50:44.280 --> 00:50:46.469
We don't actually know if it
was used as a temple.

00:50:46.469 --> 00:50:49.389
We have no divinity that's been
associated with it.

00:50:49.389 --> 00:50:52.804
We actually think it may have
been used as a museum,

00:50:52.804 --> 00:50:55.682
as a museum,
and I'm going to say more about

00:50:55.682 --> 00:50:57.090
that in a moment.
 

00:50:57.090 --> 00:50:58.530
Here's another reconstruction.
 

00:50:58.530 --> 00:51:00.070
This one is from Ward-Perkins.
 

00:51:00.070 --> 00:51:03.090
You can see that it is roughly
the same as--

00:51:03.090 --> 00:51:06.349
it is the same as the other,
with one exception,

00:51:06.349 --> 00:51:09.353
and that is it shows an
entranceway that's made up of

00:51:09.353 --> 00:51:11.550
three doors and a number of
columns.

00:51:11.550 --> 00:51:13.059
This was thought,
for a very long time,

00:51:13.059 --> 00:51:18.940
to be the case that there was
an elaborate entranceway,

00:51:18.940 --> 00:51:21.440
with columns and projecting
entablatures,

00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:23.864
the sort of thing that we
haven't seen yet in built

00:51:23.864 --> 00:51:26.563
architecture,
but we did see in Second Style

00:51:26.563 --> 00:51:27.909
Roman wall painting.
 

00:51:27.909 --> 00:51:30.458
But that idea has been
discredited, and now people

00:51:30.458 --> 00:51:33.630
believe it is much more likely
that the façade was very

00:51:33.630 --> 00:51:34.150
plain.
 

00:51:34.150 --> 00:51:39.329
The reason that this idea came
to the fore is that eventually,

00:51:39.329 --> 00:51:44.114
when the Argiletum was filled
in with a forum by Vespasian's

00:51:44.114 --> 00:51:49.130
second son Domitian,
Domitian did build a forum that

00:51:49.130 --> 00:51:53.159
is in part preserved,
and which we will look at next

00:51:53.159 --> 00:51:54.059
week I believe.
 

00:51:54.059 --> 00:51:58.594
But that forum had on the walls
a series of columns with

00:51:58.594 --> 00:52:00.739
projecting entablatures.
 

00:52:00.739 --> 00:52:04.250
And that does still exist now,
or part of it does still exist.

00:52:04.250 --> 00:52:07.565
So I think that's what
originally gave archaeologists

00:52:07.565 --> 00:52:10.818
the idea that that was there
before, and was part of

00:52:10.818 --> 00:52:12.349
Vespasian's complex.
 

00:52:12.349 --> 00:52:16.467
But that seems not to have been
the case, and the reconstruction

00:52:16.467 --> 00:52:20.456
that you have on your Monument
List is the one that you should

00:52:20.456 --> 00:52:21.110
go by.
 

00:52:21.110 --> 00:52:24.976
Let's get back to the whole
point about the museum,

00:52:24.976 --> 00:52:29.385
whether this served as a kind
of museum in the time of the

00:52:29.385 --> 00:52:31.010
Flavian emperors.
 

00:52:31.010 --> 00:52:33.768
I mentioned the great victory
that Titus had over Jerusalem,

00:52:33.768 --> 00:52:36.291
a victory--at least from the
Roman point of view it was

00:52:36.291 --> 00:52:38.885
great;
obviously it was not great for

00:52:38.885 --> 00:52:43.067
Judea, because the area was
taken over by the Romans and the

00:52:43.067 --> 00:52:45.760
famous Jewish Temple was
destroyed.

00:52:45.760 --> 00:52:51.530
And Titus also did not hesitate
to ramble through the--

00:52:51.530 --> 00:52:54.148
with his men,
with his soldiers--go through

00:52:54.148 --> 00:52:57.954
the Temple and pick and choose
what he wanted to bring back to

00:52:57.954 --> 00:52:59.139
Rome as spoils.
 

00:52:59.139 --> 00:53:02.121
He took the great
seven-branched candelabrum from

00:53:02.121 --> 00:53:02.929
the temple.
 

00:53:02.929 --> 00:53:06.219
He took the Ark of the Covenant
from the Temple;

00:53:06.219 --> 00:53:09.081
he took a whole host of other
items from the Temple,

00:53:09.081 --> 00:53:11.719
and he brought them back to
Rome as trophies.

00:53:11.719 --> 00:53:14.610
And we see this famous scene on
the Arch of Titus,

00:53:14.610 --> 00:53:18.268
an arch that Domitian put up in
honor of his brother--and we'll

00:53:18.268 --> 00:53:19.920
look at that on Tuesday.
 

00:53:19.920 --> 00:53:24.050
The Arch of Titus has a scene
that depicts the Roman soldiers

00:53:24.050 --> 00:53:27.010
bringing the seven-branched
candelabrum,

00:53:27.010 --> 00:53:29.650
and a table with other objects
on it,

00:53:29.650 --> 00:53:31.704
from that temple,
back to Rome,

00:53:31.704 --> 00:53:34.579
and parading with those through
an arch.

00:53:34.579 --> 00:53:37.951
Those spoils we know were
placed by Vespasian,

00:53:37.951 --> 00:53:41.023
by his father,
with whom he shared a joint

00:53:41.023 --> 00:53:44.920
triumph, because of this victory
over Jerusalem;

00:53:44.920 --> 00:53:49.500
it was placed in the Forum
Pacis, once that was built.

00:53:49.500 --> 00:53:54.065
So it was in part a place where
he could display the spoils of

00:53:54.065 --> 00:53:56.648
war,
because of the fact that the

00:53:56.648 --> 00:54:00.547
legitimacy that he gained
through this conquest was so

00:54:00.547 --> 00:54:04.277
important to his dynasty,
to the right of his dynasty to

00:54:04.277 --> 00:54:06.510
rule,
and to the right of his sons to

00:54:06.510 --> 00:54:07.469
rule after him.
 

00:54:07.469 --> 00:54:09.639
So he wants to make that point
clear.

00:54:09.639 --> 00:54:13.764
But again he's very shrewd
politically and he also wants to

00:54:13.764 --> 00:54:17.179
make sure that the people have
access to this.

00:54:17.179 --> 00:54:20.307
He wants to remind them when
Nero was emperor of Rome,

00:54:20.307 --> 00:54:23.909
he had things in his villa that
he would never have dreamed of

00:54:23.909 --> 00:54:25.150
sharing with you.
 

00:54:25.150 --> 00:54:28.516
You weren't able to come in and
dine there and have petals and

00:54:28.516 --> 00:54:30.780
fragrances fall on you while you
dined;

00:54:30.780 --> 00:54:33.550
you were not allowed into this
space.

00:54:33.550 --> 00:54:36.670
"But now you can come to
the Colosseum and you can go to

00:54:36.670 --> 00:54:37.400
this museum.
 

00:54:37.400 --> 00:54:40.505
And while you're in the museum,
you might as well look at these

00:54:40.505 --> 00:54:42.860
great spoils that I captured
from Jerusalem,

00:54:42.860 --> 00:54:46.940
that bring credit to me and
legitimacy to my dynasty."

00:54:46.940 --> 00:54:50.079
He also took--what's also
interesting and makes this more

00:54:50.079 --> 00:54:53.134
museum-like,
is that he also took some of

00:54:53.134 --> 00:54:56.929
the statuary that Nero had
stolen from Greece,

00:54:56.929 --> 00:55:00.019
when he went there to compete
in those Olympic Games and so

00:55:00.019 --> 00:55:01.606
on,
that he had stolen from Greece,

00:55:01.606 --> 00:55:04.079
and elsewhere,
and put up in his villa,

00:55:04.079 --> 00:55:08.784
he also put those in the museum
and opened that collection also

00:55:08.784 --> 00:55:10.530
to the Roman people.
 

00:55:10.530 --> 00:55:13.293
And we even know some of the
statues that were there,

00:55:13.293 --> 00:55:16.324
that were taken from Nero's
Domus Aurea, and put into this

00:55:16.324 --> 00:55:16.909
museum.
 

00:55:16.909 --> 00:55:21.969
One of them was a famous cow;
a cow that had been done by the

00:55:21.969 --> 00:55:24.934
well-known Greek artist,
Myron, M-y-r-o-n,

00:55:24.934 --> 00:55:26.380
the Cow of Myron.
 

00:55:26.380 --> 00:55:33.617
And the second was an image,
a sculpted image--we're not

00:55:33.617 --> 00:55:35.530
sure;
I don't think we know whether

00:55:35.530 --> 00:55:39.240
it was in marble or bronze,
the original--but an image of a

00:55:39.240 --> 00:55:42.987
reclining Nile River,
who is surrounded by sixteen

00:55:42.987 --> 00:55:46.490
kids, who are running around,
up and down on top of him and

00:55:46.490 --> 00:55:47.150
around him.
 

00:55:47.150 --> 00:55:51.304
Another famous statue that was
in Nero's possession,

00:55:51.304 --> 00:55:56.193
that gets put into what appears
to have been a very important

00:55:56.193 --> 00:55:57.090
museum.
 

00:55:57.090 --> 00:56:04.362
You see here another Google--an
excellent Google Earth view,

00:56:04.362 --> 00:56:09.539
aerial view,
of part of the Roman Forum.

00:56:09.539 --> 00:56:12.628
The Colosseum,
of course, is way over here,

00:56:12.628 --> 00:56:16.601
and we can see the central
part, or part of the central

00:56:16.601 --> 00:56:18.219
part of the Forum.
 

00:56:18.219 --> 00:56:20.969
We're looking back toward the
Victor Emmanuel Monument.

00:56:20.969 --> 00:56:24.527
We're looking back toward the
Campidoglio, as redesigned by

00:56:24.527 --> 00:56:26.489
Michelangelo,
the oval piazza.

00:56:26.489 --> 00:56:28.619
And, in fact,
here we can even see,

00:56:28.619 --> 00:56:31.500
in the upper left,
the Theater of Marcellus.

00:56:31.500 --> 00:56:35.914
So you can see that the Theater
of Marcellus was basically in a

00:56:35.914 --> 00:56:39.405
diagonal dialogue,
in a sense, with the Colosseum,

00:56:39.405 --> 00:56:41.969
that was located back over
here.

00:56:41.969 --> 00:56:45.737
The reason that I show this
view to you now is to point out

00:56:45.737 --> 00:56:49.179
also the Tabularium,
which we've already looked at.

00:56:49.179 --> 00:56:53.612
The archive sits on the back of
the Senatorial Palace,

00:56:53.612 --> 00:56:56.039
redesigned by Michelangelo.
 

00:56:56.039 --> 00:57:00.228
But right in front of it there
was a temple that was put up in

00:57:00.228 --> 00:57:02.427
honor of Vespasian,
at his death,

00:57:02.427 --> 00:57:03.869
by his son Titus.
 

00:57:03.869 --> 00:57:06.480
And then when Titus died only a
few years later,

00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:09.179
also of natural causes,
his brother,

00:57:09.179 --> 00:57:11.800
Domitian, became emperor,
and Domitian decided to

00:57:11.800 --> 00:57:14.039
rededicate the temple to both of
them,

00:57:14.039 --> 00:57:18.429
to Vespasian and also to Titus.
 

00:57:18.429 --> 00:57:21.864
So it became the Temple of the
two divi,

00:57:21.864 --> 00:57:25.449
because Titus was also
divinized at his death.

00:57:25.449 --> 00:57:28.199
And there were statue bases
that were found,

00:57:28.199 --> 00:57:30.768
that stood in front of this
temple,

00:57:30.768 --> 00:57:33.873
with inscriptions indicating
that they honored those two

00:57:33.873 --> 00:57:36.652
individuals,
and that they were depicted,

00:57:36.652 --> 00:57:39.849
undoubtedly,
in statues in front of this

00:57:39.849 --> 00:57:40.510
temple.
 

00:57:40.510 --> 00:57:44.460
Only three columns of that
temple still survive;

00:57:44.460 --> 00:57:46.789
some of the foundations as
well, of course.

00:57:46.789 --> 00:57:51.992
And you can see it in the Roman
Forum, right near the Tabularium

00:57:51.992 --> 00:57:52.820
in Rome.
 

00:57:52.820 --> 00:57:55.090
If you look at it,
you can see that these are

00:57:55.090 --> 00:57:56.639
Corinthian fluted capitals .
 

00:57:56.639 --> 00:58:02.010
It was probably a quite
conventional temple.

00:58:02.010 --> 00:58:06.844
But you do see that there is a
frieze that seems to represent a

00:58:06.844 --> 00:58:10.900
number of sacrificial
implements: a libation dish and

00:58:10.900 --> 00:58:13.699
a pitcher,
and so on and so forth.

00:58:13.699 --> 00:58:17.742
A very large chunk of that
frieze and entablature is still

00:58:17.742 --> 00:58:19.018
preserved today.
 

00:58:19.018 --> 00:58:24.255
It's not with the temple but
rather in the Tabularium itself,

00:58:24.255 --> 00:58:26.699
and I show it to you here.
 

00:58:26.699 --> 00:58:32.639
An extremely well-preserved
section of the decorative frieze

00:58:32.639 --> 00:58:37.414
of the Temple of Vespasian,
the Temple of Divine Vespasian

00:58:37.414 --> 00:58:40.617
in Rome,
which you see again dates to

00:58:40.617 --> 00:58:42.579
around 79 to 81 A.D.
 

00:58:42.579 --> 00:58:48.009
And it's very instructive,
not only in terms of the way in

00:58:48.009 --> 00:58:50.628
which Titus first,
and then his brother,

00:58:50.628 --> 00:58:52.159
were thinking of honoring
members of their family,

00:58:52.159 --> 00:58:59.840
but also in how ornamental this
is.

00:58:59.840 --> 00:59:03.753
This is decoration that is more
richly textured than any that

00:59:03.753 --> 00:59:07.210
we've seen thus far,
and also more richly undercut.

00:59:07.210 --> 00:59:11.268
The artists are beginning to
use the drill to create very

00:59:11.268 --> 00:59:14.168
deep shadows among the
decorative motifs,

00:59:14.168 --> 00:59:16.849
to make them stand out even
more.

00:59:16.849 --> 00:59:20.523
And you might remember--I
didn't bring it back to show

00:59:20.523 --> 00:59:22.356
you--
but you might remember that

00:59:22.356 --> 00:59:25.402
section that I showed you from
the Temple of Venus Genetrix in

00:59:25.402 --> 00:59:29.594
the Forum of Julius Caesar,
where I mentioned that that had

00:59:29.594 --> 00:59:33.010
been restored in the time of
Domitian,

00:59:33.010 --> 00:59:34.416
second son of Vespasian,
and also in the Trajanic

00:59:34.416 --> 00:59:34.679
period.
 

00:59:34.679 --> 00:59:40.974
And that the very deep carving
indicated to us not only that it

00:59:40.974 --> 00:59:44.905
had been done later,
but also the fact that the

00:59:44.905 --> 00:59:47.913
Flavians were particularly
interested in this very

00:59:47.913 --> 00:59:51.201
ornamental decoration,
very deeply undercut

00:59:51.201 --> 00:59:52.469
ornamentation.
 

00:59:52.469 --> 00:59:53.869
And we see that so well here.
 

00:59:53.869 --> 00:59:56.489
We see also the
interesting--the variety of

00:59:56.489 --> 00:59:59.672
motifs in this frieze,
and in the decorative part of

00:59:59.672 --> 01:00:00.110
it.
 

01:00:00.110 --> 01:00:04.050
And then the frieze itself is
very interesting.

01:00:04.050 --> 01:00:06.458
If we look at the objects,
we see that they are mainly

01:00:06.458 --> 01:00:08.460
objects that are used in ritual
sacrifice.

01:00:08.460 --> 01:00:11.451
We see the skulls of bulls,
just as we saw them in the

01:00:11.451 --> 01:00:14.500
inner precinct of the Ara Pacis,
one on either side.

01:00:14.500 --> 01:00:16.070
We see a libation dish.
 

01:00:16.070 --> 01:00:20.409
We see an axe, over here;
that's to knock out the animals.

01:00:20.409 --> 01:00:24.409
Here's the knife to slit the
throat of the animals;

01:00:24.409 --> 01:00:27.679
the pitcher to pour wine on an
altar;

01:00:27.679 --> 01:00:30.018
a whip, for whatever purpose
that had;

01:00:30.018 --> 01:00:33.969
and then over here a helmet,
as you can see.

01:00:33.969 --> 01:00:37.456
So all of these implements that
were used in sacrifice,

01:00:37.456 --> 01:00:41.007
regularly used in sacrifice,
arranged like a still life,

01:00:41.007 --> 01:00:43.010
against a blank background.
 

01:00:43.010 --> 01:00:46.938
And I don't know about you,
but when I look at this I am

01:00:46.938 --> 01:00:51.010
reminded of some of Fourth Style
Roman wall decoration;

01:00:51.010 --> 01:00:53.795
of the still life paintings
that we saw in the Third and the

01:00:53.795 --> 01:00:55.588
Fourth Style,
where you have individual

01:00:55.588 --> 01:00:57.429
objects against a blank
background.

01:00:57.429 --> 01:01:03.150
And also the decorative nature
of this conjures up some of the

01:01:03.150 --> 01:01:06.407
decoration that we see,
the profusion,

01:01:06.407 --> 01:01:09.737
the almost overly decorative
element of Fourth Style Roman

01:01:09.737 --> 01:01:10.730
wall painting.
 

01:01:10.730 --> 01:01:14.291
And since this dates to 79 to
81, and you'll remember the

01:01:14.291 --> 01:01:17.981
Fourth Style is 62 to 79 at
Pompeii -- but we know that the

01:01:17.981 --> 01:01:21.918
Fourth Style continued on;
it was the Fourth Style that

01:01:21.918 --> 01:01:26.409
was the most popular style post
79, obviously not in Pompeii or

01:01:26.409 --> 01:01:29.960
Herculaneum, but elsewhere in
the Roman world.

01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:32.987
So this very much in keeping;
we're seeing in architecture

01:01:32.987 --> 01:01:36.213
something very much in keeping
vis-à-vis decoration,

01:01:36.213 --> 01:01:38.940
as we see in Fourth Style Roman
wall painting.

01:01:38.940 --> 01:01:43.552
The last monument that I want
to show you today is in many

01:01:43.552 --> 01:01:45.980
respects the most important.
 

01:01:45.980 --> 01:01:48.815
That seems like a strange thing
to say, because what could be

01:01:48.815 --> 01:01:51.369
more important than the icon of
Rome, the Colosseum?

01:01:51.369 --> 01:01:53.556
But when we think about it,
the Colosseum was actually a

01:01:53.556 --> 01:01:54.789
fairly conservative building.
 

01:01:54.789 --> 01:01:55.242
Right?
 

01:01:55.242 --> 01:01:58.936
It goes back to the
Amphitheater at Pompeii in its

01:01:58.936 --> 01:02:01.539
general plan,
and it is quite similar to,

01:02:01.539 --> 01:02:04.233
in fact very similar to,
the Theater of Marcellus,

01:02:04.233 --> 01:02:06.510
which was done at the time of
Augustus.

01:02:06.510 --> 01:02:09.244
And Augustus was trying to
connect his reign to that of

01:02:09.244 --> 01:02:11.068
Periclean Athens,
and was using stone

01:02:11.068 --> 01:02:11.929
construction.
 

01:02:11.929 --> 01:02:15.010
And the Colosseum is of stone
construction,

01:02:15.010 --> 01:02:18.253
although it also,
of course, makes use of annular

01:02:18.253 --> 01:02:22.739
vaults made out of concrete,
and also innovates with the new

01:02:22.739 --> 01:02:23.820
groin vaults.
 

01:02:23.820 --> 01:02:26.376
But for all intents and
purposes a relatively

01:02:26.376 --> 01:02:29.630
conservative building at this
time, the Colosseum was.

01:02:29.630 --> 01:02:32.594
The building that I'm now going
to show you was not that way at

01:02:32.594 --> 01:02:34.398
all,
even though it's a building

01:02:34.398 --> 01:02:37.119
that is much less well known
than the Colosseum,

01:02:37.119 --> 01:02:38.780
and it also doesn't exist any
longer,

01:02:38.780 --> 01:02:39.820
unfortunately.
 

01:02:39.820 --> 01:02:42.690
And those are the Baths of
Titus.

01:02:42.690 --> 01:02:46.657
A very important structure for
us, the Baths of Titus--the

01:02:46.657 --> 01:02:50.137
Thermae Titi--the Baths of
Titus, that date to A.D.

01:02:50.137 --> 01:02:54.242
80, right smack in the middle
of Titus' brief reign of 79 to

01:02:54.242 --> 01:02:54.869
81.
 

01:02:54.869 --> 01:02:58.710
They were put up in Rome,
and they were put up in Rome,

01:02:58.710 --> 01:03:01.599
not surprisingly--you know the
narrative here--

01:03:01.599 --> 01:03:04.965
not surprisingly on that land
that had earlier been

01:03:04.965 --> 01:03:08.465
expropriated by Nero:
another instance of the Flavian

01:03:08.465 --> 01:03:11.090
emperors giving back to the
people.

01:03:11.090 --> 01:03:13.702
You've given them a museum,
you've given them an

01:03:13.702 --> 01:03:15.980
amphitheater,
and now you're going to give

01:03:15.980 --> 01:03:16.869
them a bath.
 

01:03:16.869 --> 01:03:18.842
Next to an amphitheater,
the bath is what they wanted

01:03:18.842 --> 01:03:20.467
most of all --
a place where they could go to

01:03:20.467 --> 01:03:22.530
bathe,
but also hang out with their

01:03:22.530 --> 01:03:23.809
family and friends.
 

01:03:23.809 --> 01:03:27.429
So again, giving back to the
people what they wanted;

01:03:27.429 --> 01:03:30.871
a wise, shrewd political move
on the part of Vespasian,

01:03:30.871 --> 01:03:34.059
being followed by his equally
shrewd son, Titus.

01:03:34.059 --> 01:03:38.289
The location of the Baths of
Titus was next to--

01:03:38.289 --> 01:03:40.860
actually what you see here,
on top of the Golden House,

01:03:40.860 --> 01:03:43.510
is actually the plan of a later
bath,

01:03:43.510 --> 01:03:45.992
the Baths of the emperor
Trajan, which we'll look at in

01:03:45.992 --> 01:03:46.590
the future.
 

01:03:46.590 --> 01:03:51.202
But the smaller Baths of Titus
were put to the--I believe it

01:03:51.202 --> 01:03:55.347
was, yes--the west of the
Esquiline Wing of the Golden

01:03:55.347 --> 01:03:56.130
House.
 

01:03:56.130 --> 01:03:59.422
Right just between the Golden
House and where you see

01:03:59.422 --> 01:04:03.096
'Esquiline' written up there,
was the location of the Baths

01:04:03.096 --> 01:04:03.920
of Titus.
 

01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:08.139
All that survives of the Baths
of Titus is part of one wall,

01:04:08.139 --> 01:04:10.143
a brick-faced,
concrete wall,

01:04:10.143 --> 01:04:13.219
with some engaged columns;
that's all we have.

01:04:13.219 --> 01:04:15.239
But the building was still
standing--

01:04:15.239 --> 01:04:18.034
the building was still much
better preserved in the

01:04:18.034 --> 01:04:20.733
sixteenth century,
when it was drawn by

01:04:20.733 --> 01:04:24.521
Renaissance architects,
most specifically by Andrea

01:04:24.521 --> 01:04:26.871
Palladio--
his name I put on the Monument

01:04:26.871 --> 01:04:27.610
List for you.
 

01:04:27.610 --> 01:04:31.092
Andrea Palladio drew a very
complete plan of it,

01:04:31.092 --> 01:04:35.612
and it is on the basis of that
plan that modern plans are made

01:04:35.612 --> 01:04:37.539
of the Baths of Titus.
 

01:04:37.539 --> 01:04:38.710
And I show it to you here.
 

01:04:38.710 --> 01:04:42.101
And we believe this is a very
accurate plan of the Baths of

01:04:42.101 --> 01:04:42.570
Titus.
 

01:04:42.570 --> 01:04:46.449
And I compare it for you here
with?

01:04:46.449 --> 01:04:50.940
Again, those of you studying
for the midterm,

01:04:50.940 --> 01:04:52.369
what's this?
 

01:04:52.369 --> 01:04:52.572
Student:  Stabian--.
 

01:04:52.572 --> 01:04:52.820
Prof: The Stabian
Baths;

01:04:52.820 --> 01:04:56.210
Stabian Baths in Pompeii,
second century B.C.

01:04:56.210 --> 01:04:57.409
Very good.
 

01:04:57.409 --> 01:05:01.579
And we talked about that as the
typical earlier bath structure.

01:05:01.579 --> 01:05:04.650
And just a very quick review,
to remind ourselves of its

01:05:04.650 --> 01:05:05.599
major features.
 

01:05:05.599 --> 01:05:09.309
It had the palaestra
over here, surrounded by columns

01:05:09.309 --> 01:05:11.809
on three sides;
the piscina or the

01:05:11.809 --> 01:05:14.268
natatio,
swimming pool at the left.

01:05:14.268 --> 01:05:17.862
And then most importantly the
bathing block on the right side

01:05:17.862 --> 01:05:19.000
of the structure.
 

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:23.034
A men's section and a women's
section, with that sequence of

01:05:23.034 --> 01:05:26.659
rooms: the apodyterium or
the dressing room;

01:05:26.659 --> 01:05:29.155
the tepidarium,
rectangular,

01:05:29.155 --> 01:05:32.255
or the warm room;
the caldarium,

01:05:32.255 --> 01:05:36.639
hot room, with an apse and a
cold water splash basin;

01:05:36.639 --> 01:05:39.648
and then, most importantly,
the frigidarium,

01:05:39.648 --> 01:05:42.780
that small, round building with
radiating alcoves.

01:05:42.780 --> 01:05:45.260
That was the typical Roman bath
structure,

01:05:45.260 --> 01:05:50.516
until we begin to see our first
example in Rome of the so-called

01:05:50.516 --> 01:05:53.768
"imperial bath"
structure,

01:05:53.768 --> 01:05:57.898
the plan that is used by the
emperors for the baths that they

01:05:57.898 --> 01:05:59.000
build in Rome.
 

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.768
It is possible that Titus' was
not the first.

01:06:01.768 --> 01:06:04.329
There's been some
speculation--we know that Nero

01:06:04.329 --> 01:06:06.969
had built a bath--
there has been some speculation

01:06:06.969 --> 01:06:09.670
that Nero's Bath may have been
the first example of the

01:06:09.670 --> 01:06:11.969
imperial plan,
but we don't know for sure.

01:06:11.969 --> 01:06:16.672
But Titus'--of the ones that we
know, have the specifics about,

01:06:16.672 --> 01:06:20.615
we know that Titus' was
definitely an example of this

01:06:20.615 --> 01:06:22.739
imperial bath structure.
 

01:06:22.739 --> 01:06:26.030
And the features that are
outstanding here,

01:06:26.030 --> 01:06:29.315
that we need to focus on,
are the fact that this imperial

01:06:29.315 --> 01:06:32.309
bath structure had a very
elaborate entranceway,

01:06:32.309 --> 01:06:36.230
that consisted either of
columns on square bases,

01:06:36.230 --> 01:06:37.900
or piers, in the front.
 

01:06:37.900 --> 01:06:41.043
There seemed to have been a
series of groin vaults --

01:06:41.043 --> 01:06:44.429
anytime you see an X in plan
that means a groin vault.

01:06:44.429 --> 01:06:48.054
An elaborate stairway,
some more columns or piers

01:06:48.054 --> 01:06:50.130
here,
and more groin vaults,

01:06:50.130 --> 01:06:53.018
and another stairway,
leading into a double

01:06:53.018 --> 01:06:55.340
palaestra,
in a sense;

01:06:55.340 --> 01:06:57.606
or you could call it a combined
palaestra here,

01:06:57.606 --> 01:06:58.590
on the southern side.
 

01:06:58.590 --> 01:07:03.856
And you can see the cistern;
on the outside of the precinct,

01:07:03.856 --> 01:07:06.818
you can see the cistern that
fed water into this bath

01:07:06.818 --> 01:07:07.559
structure.
 

01:07:07.559 --> 01:07:09.869
It's roughly rectangular,
as you can see,

01:07:09.869 --> 01:07:13.199
and unlike the Stabian Baths at
Pompeii,

01:07:13.199 --> 01:07:16.429
where you have the bath complex
on the right side,

01:07:16.429 --> 01:07:21.434
you can see that the rooms that
are used for bathing are at the

01:07:21.434 --> 01:07:25.023
center of the plan,
which makes sense from the

01:07:25.023 --> 01:07:26.280
Roman standpoint.
 

01:07:26.280 --> 01:07:29.487
You know the Romans were very
focused on axiality and

01:07:29.487 --> 01:07:32.820
symmetry, and that's exactly
what they've done here.

01:07:32.820 --> 01:07:35.320
They've placed the bathing
block in the center.

01:07:35.320 --> 01:07:39.039
They've lined the rooms up
axially with one another.

01:07:39.039 --> 01:07:42.077
They've placed rooms on either
side, symmetrical rooms,

01:07:42.077 --> 01:07:44.889
it's the same on the left as it
is on the right.

01:07:44.889 --> 01:07:48.429
The rooms are symmetrically
disposed around that central

01:07:48.429 --> 01:07:49.460
bathing block.
 

01:07:49.460 --> 01:07:51.400
And they've taken the
frigidarium,

01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:53.956
which was the smallest--albeit
the most interesting

01:07:53.956 --> 01:07:56.422
architecturally--
but the smallest room in the

01:07:56.422 --> 01:07:59.409
bath, and they've made it the
largest room in the bath.

01:07:59.409 --> 01:08:01.889
Because you can see at F a very
large,

01:08:01.889 --> 01:08:04.349
cross-shaped room,
with an apse on one end,

01:08:04.349 --> 01:08:08.391
a groin vault over the center,
a single large groin vault over

01:08:08.391 --> 01:08:11.295
the center,
flanked by and buttressed by,

01:08:11.295 --> 01:08:15.010
two barrel vaults,
one on either side.

01:08:15.010 --> 01:08:18.005
And then opening off those
barrel vaults a series of

01:08:18.005 --> 01:08:20.287
rectangular alcoves with,
as you can see,

01:08:20.287 --> 01:08:23.735
with walls that are scalloped,
and then with columns that

01:08:23.735 --> 01:08:28.470
screen those alcoves from the
central groin vaulted space.

01:08:28.470 --> 01:08:31.185
So an entirely different way of
thinking about the

01:08:31.185 --> 01:08:32.350
frigidarium.
 

01:08:32.350 --> 01:08:33.756
Then that into the
tepidarium from the

01:08:33.756 --> 01:08:36.078
frigidarium,
again through a screen of

01:08:36.078 --> 01:08:38.538
columns--that's fairly
conventional,

01:08:38.538 --> 01:08:42.479
rectangular--and then into--we
see here double caldaria,

01:08:42.479 --> 01:08:45.780
two caldaria,
they also in a kind of cross

01:08:45.780 --> 01:08:47.882
shape--
although a cross shape that

01:08:47.882 --> 01:08:50.796
appears a little bit more
rounded than the case of the

01:08:50.796 --> 01:08:54.085
frigidarium--
they too screened by columns on

01:08:54.085 --> 01:08:59.435
three sides,
very open, allowing a free flow

01:08:59.435 --> 01:09:02.202
of space,
in a way that was not true of

01:09:02.202 --> 01:09:04.300
the Pompeian Baths where the
entrances were tiny,

01:09:04.300 --> 01:09:08.346
from one room to another;
here a great deal of emphasis

01:09:08.346 --> 01:09:10.310
on the free flow of space.
 

01:09:10.310 --> 01:09:13.847
So what's very important here,
the way I want to end today,

01:09:13.847 --> 01:09:15.738
is essentially where I began.
 

01:09:15.738 --> 01:09:18.390
What innovations of Nero's
architecture lived on,

01:09:18.390 --> 01:09:20.380
despite his damnatio
memoriae,

01:09:20.380 --> 01:09:23.640
and despite the fact that his
buildings were destroyed?

01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:25.100
His buildings no longer stood.
 

01:09:25.100 --> 01:09:27.279
The Domus Aurea no longer
stood, to be studied.

01:09:27.279 --> 01:09:33.319
And yet what we see is some of
the innovations did live on.

01:09:33.319 --> 01:09:35.505
And the ones that did
include--and let me just

01:09:35.505 --> 01:09:37.644
compare,
as the last image,

01:09:37.644 --> 01:09:41.583
compare the octagonal room,
an axonometric view of the

01:09:41.583 --> 01:09:45.359
octagonal room,
with the Baths of Titus in Rome.

01:09:45.359 --> 01:09:48.751
What we see are some of the
experimentations that were

01:09:48.751 --> 01:09:51.054
taking place in private
architecture,

01:09:51.054 --> 01:09:52.590
palace architecture.
 

01:09:52.590 --> 01:09:55.621
And I should make the point
that just as we've said that

01:09:55.621 --> 01:09:59.368
tomb architecture was often very
eccentric and very experimental,

01:09:59.368 --> 01:10:01.350
the same was true for private
architecture;

01:10:01.350 --> 01:10:02.738
not surprisingly.
 

01:10:02.738 --> 01:10:06.090
These are buildings that people
make personal decisions about.

01:10:06.090 --> 01:10:07.229
How do I want to live?
 

01:10:07.229 --> 01:10:09.408
In what kind of spaces do I
want to live?

01:10:09.408 --> 01:10:13.979
And in what kind of building do
I want to be buried?

01:10:13.979 --> 01:10:15.880
Those are very personal
decisions,

01:10:15.880 --> 01:10:19.180
and they were much more likely
to be experimental decisions,

01:10:19.180 --> 01:10:21.439
where public architecture had
to toe the line,

01:10:21.439 --> 01:10:24.497
to a certain extent,
and had to be more closely

01:10:24.497 --> 01:10:26.890
allied with what had gone
before,

01:10:26.890 --> 01:10:29.948
and it was also more
referential in terms of looking

01:10:29.948 --> 01:10:32.050
back to other emperors and so
on.

01:10:32.050 --> 01:10:34.868
So we see experiments in
private palace and tomb

01:10:34.868 --> 01:10:37.210
architecture,
villa architecture that we

01:10:37.210 --> 01:10:40.390
don't tend to see as much in
public architecture.

01:10:40.390 --> 01:10:44.279
But what we see happening here
is very momentous,

01:10:44.279 --> 01:10:47.863
and that is the lessons that
were explored first in private

01:10:47.863 --> 01:10:51.632
architecture are being adopted
in the most public of all Roman

01:10:51.632 --> 01:10:53.573
buildings,
a bath building,

01:10:53.573 --> 01:10:56.805
and it's being done in a very
different way from the

01:10:56.805 --> 01:10:57.630
Colosseum.
 

01:10:57.630 --> 01:11:00.948
Most important,
the most important adoptions,

01:11:00.948 --> 01:11:03.579
innovations,
that were in Nero's Domus

01:11:03.579 --> 01:11:05.832
Aurea,
that are also included in the

01:11:05.832 --> 01:11:07.719
Baths of Titus,
are axiality,

01:11:07.719 --> 01:11:11.550
symmetry--and I've described
both of those already--

01:11:11.550 --> 01:11:14.487
new vaulted shapes,
which we also did see in the

01:11:14.487 --> 01:11:17.042
Colosseum,
the use of the groin vault

01:11:17.042 --> 01:11:18.250
extensively here.
 

01:11:18.250 --> 01:11:21.944
And then perhaps most
importantly this free flow of

01:11:21.944 --> 01:11:24.060
space,
the free flow of space,

01:11:24.060 --> 01:11:25.728
the vistas,
the panoramas,

01:11:25.728 --> 01:11:28.760
from one part of this bath
structure to another,

01:11:28.760 --> 01:11:32.399
that is very different from the
bath structure of the past,

01:11:32.399 --> 01:11:35.210
from the bath structures,
for example,

01:11:35.210 --> 01:11:36.859
of Pompeii.
 

01:11:36.859 --> 01:11:40.045
So what we see in sum is the
fact that despite Nero's

01:11:40.045 --> 01:11:43.432
damnatio memoriae,
despite the fact that that

01:11:43.432 --> 01:11:46.640
allowed authorities,
and in fact the new emperor,

01:11:46.640 --> 01:11:48.880
to destroy the portraits of
Nero,

01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:51.886
to raze his palace to the
ground--which Vespasian did

01:11:51.886 --> 01:11:53.818
after all--
despite that,

01:11:53.818 --> 01:11:59.439
the architectural innovations
of Nero's Domus Aurea lived on;

01:11:59.439 --> 01:12:01.430
they lived on in the Baths of
Titus.

01:12:01.430 --> 01:12:04.460
And we're going to see they
lived on in perpetuity,

01:12:04.460 --> 01:12:09.144
and we're going to see them
continuing to have a huge impact

01:12:09.144 --> 01:12:12.399
on the evolution of Roman
architecture.

01:12:12.399 --> 01:12:13.369
Thank you.

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:02.860
Professor Robert
Shiller: If we may begin.

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.340
Today we have a very special
lecture.

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.020
I am very pleased to introduce
Carl Icahn as our lecturer.

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:15.627
Mr.
Icahn has a career that is

00:00:15.627 --> 00:00:21.021
really relevant to some of the
topics we have talked about in

00:00:21.021 --> 00:00:24.230
this course.
One theme that we've talked

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.180
about in this course is
corporate democracy.

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.290
We've talked about a book
written by Berle and Means

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:28.944
[Adolf A.
Berle and Gardiner C.

00:00:28.944 --> 00:00:30.098
Means, Modern Corporation
and Private Property,

00:00:30.098 --> 00:00:30.970
New York: Commerce Clearing
House,

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.512
1932.]
who said that shareholders are

00:00:33.512 --> 00:00:37.678
so dispersed that they have
really no control over a company

00:00:37.678 --> 00:00:41.210
and boards of directors are
self-perpetuating.

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.395
Well Carl Icahn has made a
career of really opposing that

00:00:45.395 --> 00:00:49.880
tendency in American business of
self-perpetuating boards.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:54.228
Carl Icahn graduated from
Princeton University,

00:00:54.228 --> 00:00:59.638
pre-med in 1957.
In 1968, he founded Icahn and

00:00:59.638 --> 00:01:01.726
Company.
This company,

00:01:01.726 --> 00:01:04.537
Icahn and Company,
has taken substantial

00:01:04.537 --> 00:01:08.790
shareholder positions in a
number of major corporations,

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.555
including: RJR Nabisco,
TWA, Texaco,

00:01:12.555 --> 00:01:15.891
Phillips Petroleum,
Time Warner,

00:01:15.891 --> 00:01:19.177
Motorola.
And when Icahn and Company

00:01:19.177 --> 00:01:23.386
takes a position in a company it
then becomes active in the

00:01:23.386 --> 00:01:27.523
management of this company and
in changing the way they do

00:01:27.523 --> 00:01:30.792
business.
And they have done this with

00:01:30.792 --> 00:01:34.944
enormous success.
So, Carl, I'm very pleased that

00:01:34.944 --> 00:01:37.910
you could come and do this
today.

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:39.080
Mr.
Carl Icahn: Good to see

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:40.255
you, Bob.
Professor Robert

00:01:40.255 --> 00:01:42.818
Shiller: It would be really
nice if you can give some clues

00:01:42.818 --> 00:01:45.492
to our students here,
who many of them are themselves

00:01:45.492 --> 00:01:48.478
launching out on careers,
of how you got started on this

00:01:48.478 --> 00:01:51.627
and what your philosophy is and
what you would recommend to

00:01:51.627 --> 00:01:52.528
them.
Mr.

00:01:52.528 --> 00:01:55.990
Carl Icahn: The career
you're asking about--I went down

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.751
to Wall Street back in--way back
in the '60s and I thought I was

00:01:59.751 --> 00:02:03.980
really--I had gone to Princeton,
a really good school.

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:09.810
I had gotten in there from a
tough high school;

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.039
I was the first to go from my
high school.

00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:14.838
Nobody believed I could do
it--they never took an Ivy

00:02:14.838 --> 00:02:18.014
League--the Ivy League never
took anybody from this school I

00:02:18.014 --> 00:02:20.780
went to.
But anyway, I went;

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.150
got in and left there and I
thought I was a real smart guy.

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.879
Cut it short--went down to Wall
Street and worked with Jack

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:33.120
Dreyfus and then I was playing
the market in 1961.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.664
That shows how old I am.
And in a bull market you make a

00:02:37.664 --> 00:02:40.639
great deal of money by doing
leverage.

00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:44.560
It's a little bit like today
with all the leverage that we

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.449
had and now might be coming to
fruition.

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:50.738
I was borrowing money and
bought all these convertibles

00:02:50.738 --> 00:02:53.783
and I thought I was a genius and
Jack Dreyfus said,

00:02:53.783 --> 00:02:56.220
you're going to lose all your
money.

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.893
I had made a few bucks playing
poker and that's how I started

00:02:59.893 --> 00:03:02.832
with about eight,
ten thousand dollars and I made

00:03:02.832 --> 00:03:05.219
all this money by borrowing at
90%.

00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:11.329
I would go out and I was making
a lot more in two weeks than my

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:15.364
father made in two years.
My father said,

00:03:15.364 --> 00:03:18.569
well you know,
put the money away.

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:21.110
I said, no Dad,
I'm really going to make a

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:23.391
fortune here.
So, I went out--I remember

00:03:23.391 --> 00:03:25.420
once--and bought a Galaxy
convertible.

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.970
It was a beautiful car.
I had a beautiful girlfriend;

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.370
she was a model--it was just
pretty nice.

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:40.750
What happened?
The crash came in 1962.

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.248
I was wiped out in one day;
I didn't even have the poker

00:03:44.248 --> 00:03:47.362
winnings left.
I tell you, I can't recall if

00:03:47.362 --> 00:03:52.086
the car left first or the girl
left first, but it was pretty

00:03:52.086 --> 00:03:55.129
close--maybe the same day
actually.

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:59.617
After that, I learned you have
to learn something and I became

00:03:59.617 --> 00:04:04.673
an expert in options.
After that, I built a following

00:04:04.673 --> 00:04:10.966
and built a big following and a
big commission base by just

00:04:10.966 --> 00:04:15.530
learning one area very well.
Probably, I knew that area

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.470
better than almost anyone on
Wall Street.

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.122
Not to sound too presumptuous,
but very few people knew it,

00:04:20.122 --> 00:04:22.730
so it doesn't mean very much.
But in any event,

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:26.790
I built up a big following and
in 1968 bought a seat on the

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:30.569
stock exchange with the help of
a one of my uncles.

00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:33.624
By that time,
I had saved a pretty big amount

00:04:33.624 --> 00:04:39.551
of money for those days.
Then, I got into arbitrage--but

00:04:39.551 --> 00:04:44.051
not merger, bona fide.
That's something else you

00:04:44.051 --> 00:04:47.165
could--you can still do it
today, but it's much tougher

00:04:47.165 --> 00:04:50.129
with all these computers.
So, I don't do it because I

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:53.620
don't understand the computers;
they're beyond me,

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:57.399
so I don't work with them too
well.

00:04:57.399 --> 00:05:00.550
I'm being a little facetious,
but not too facetious.

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:04.145
You could buy different
convertible bonds and short the

00:05:04.145 --> 00:05:06.446
stocks against them.
You had no risk,

00:05:06.446 --> 00:05:09.529
but you could make a lot of
money and eventually we did real

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:12.749
well with that.
What I do today still is pretty

00:05:12.749 --> 00:05:16.308
much the same idea.
You buy stocks in a company

00:05:16.308 --> 00:05:21.027
that is cheap and you look at
the asset value of the companies

00:05:21.027 --> 00:05:25.204
that you buy the stocks in and
it becomes a little more

00:05:25.204 --> 00:05:28.213
complex.
Basically, you look for the

00:05:28.213 --> 00:05:32.294
reason that they're really cheap
and the major reason is

00:05:32.294 --> 00:05:35.560
often--and usually--very poor
management.

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.960
In a sense, it's like an
arbitrage.

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.259
You go in;
you buy a lot of stock in a

00:05:40.259 --> 00:05:42.855
company;
and you then try to make

00:05:42.855 --> 00:05:46.002
changes at the company.
Today, if you read the

00:05:46.002 --> 00:05:48.604
newspapers tomorrow,
you'll read--we're trying to do

00:05:48.604 --> 00:05:51.563
the same thing at Motorola and
if you bother to read The

00:05:51.563 --> 00:05:54.012
Wall Street Journal
tomorrow--or maybe The

00:05:54.012 --> 00:05:56.128
Times,
I don't know--you'll see a

00:05:56.128 --> 00:05:58.290
little bit of what we're trying
to do there.

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:00.795
We're trying to get them to
change the structure of the

00:06:00.795 --> 00:06:03.548
company.
We think the board is a very

00:06:03.548 --> 00:06:08.290
poor board there and we're
trying to change what happens.

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:14.080
The thing about corporate
America--few people that go to

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:20.321
college, like where you are now,
and most people in America

00:06:20.321 --> 00:06:26.564
don't realize how poorly most of
our companies are run in this

00:06:26.564 --> 00:06:30.360
country,
with many exceptions.

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:34.958
They're really very poor and
when you get inside the company

00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:39.849
you realize this.
The real reason is there's no

00:06:39.849 --> 00:06:42.992
accountability;
there's no corporate democracy

00:06:42.992 --> 00:06:44.718
and I've been saying that,
prophesying it,

00:06:44.718 --> 00:06:47.708
writing about it.
The reason that we can make so

00:06:47.708 --> 00:06:51.792
much money when we go into one
of these is--I'm not even a

00:06:51.792 --> 00:06:54.057
manager;
I never took a course in

00:06:54.057 --> 00:06:57.506
management and I wouldn't
profess to really know much but

00:06:57.506 --> 00:07:00.769
I don't micromanage--I put in a
very good manager.

00:07:00.769 --> 00:07:03.873
They cut the heck out of our
costs, but they change the

00:07:03.873 --> 00:07:08.144
structure of the companies.
This is the problem in America

00:07:08.144 --> 00:07:13.180
today, in my opinion--that we
are basically undermanaged.

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:17.735
We can't compete because the
best and the brightest don't get

00:07:17.735 --> 00:07:21.000
to be at the top of the
corporate ladder.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.101
I have a sort of a metaphor
that's a little facetious,

00:07:25.101 --> 00:07:27.500
but not completely,
about it.

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:32.191
I call it anti-Darwinian;
it's anti-Darwinian in

00:07:32.191 --> 00:07:36.919
America's corporations.
That means, a guy goes to

00:07:36.919 --> 00:07:42.870
college and this is the guy that
gets to be the CEO and,

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:47.115
yet, he's in college and he's
the kind of guy that was the

00:07:47.115 --> 00:07:50.991
president of the fraternity.
Now, all these presidents of

00:07:50.991 --> 00:07:54.333
fraternities aren't bad guys,
but basically the normal guy

00:07:54.333 --> 00:07:57.557
that I remember at college
was--he's always there at the

00:07:57.557 --> 00:08:01.250
fraternity or the eating club.
He's always there to be there.

00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:04.055
If you have a bad day,
you walk over to the club and

00:08:04.055 --> 00:08:06.639
you're feeling bad--your
girlfriend left you;

00:08:06.639 --> 00:08:11.190
you did bad on a test score or
whatever--and you go over there;

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:13.653
he's always there.
He buys you a drink and you sit

00:08:13.653 --> 00:08:15.810
around with him;
he commiserates with you;

00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:19.160
you play a little pool or
whatever and he tells you

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:21.819
whatever it is.
Yeah, my girl left me;

00:08:21.819 --> 00:08:24.765
yeah well, they're all no
good--usual conversation back

00:08:24.765 --> 00:08:27.098
and forth.
What would happen would

00:08:27.098 --> 00:08:30.069
be--you'd like the guy.
You can't help but like him;

00:08:30.069 --> 00:08:32.394
you used to wonder a little
bit, when the hell did he do any

00:08:32.394 --> 00:08:34.926
work?
But, he was always there for

00:08:34.926 --> 00:08:38.220
you.
He never made many waves;

00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:40.409
he never said anything too
obtrusive;

00:08:40.409 --> 00:08:43.950
or, he never showed too much
intelligence.

00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:48.889
But, he was a good guy.
He goes--that same guy goes out

00:08:48.889 --> 00:08:53.919
into corporate America and
politically he's astute.

00:08:53.919 --> 00:09:00.001
He knows how to get along with
people and he never really rocks

00:09:00.001 --> 00:09:04.391
the boat.
He never comes up with any

00:09:04.391 --> 00:09:07.646
great idea;
he's not a threat to his

00:09:07.646 --> 00:09:09.444
superior and,
as a result,

00:09:09.444 --> 00:09:14.262
he moves up the ladder because,
really, in corporate America,

00:09:14.262 --> 00:09:17.779
there's really very little
accountability.

00:09:17.779 --> 00:09:21.669
What happens in corporate
America--he moves up that

00:09:21.669 --> 00:09:23.599
ladder.
There's a good show,

00:09:23.599 --> 00:09:27.347
"How to Succeed in Business,"
that was out many years ago that

00:09:27.347 --> 00:09:30.951
sort of sums it up.
If you say--if a genius has an

00:09:30.951 --> 00:09:34.779
idea in corporate America--the
genius has an idea;

00:09:34.779 --> 00:09:38.199
the next idea is,
they give him an idea to

00:09:38.199 --> 00:09:42.241
resign.
So, he moves along the ladder

00:09:42.241 --> 00:09:46.440
and he gets up slowly up to the
top.

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:50.318
Now he has two attributes:
he's likeable,

00:09:50.318 --> 00:09:56.039
he's politically astute and
he's a survivor--he's not really

00:09:56.039 --> 00:10:01.029
a threat and he gets to the top.
These are the attributes of

00:10:01.029 --> 00:10:03.750
today's CEOs for the most part,
with exceptions.

00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:08.929
He doesn't ruffle feathers;
he doesn't get the board upset;

00:10:08.929 --> 00:10:13.724
and as he moves up the ladder,
he finally gets to be number

00:10:13.724 --> 00:10:16.926
two to the CEO.
Now, the CEO has the same

00:10:16.926 --> 00:10:21.237
attributes--where he doesn't
want to be threatened and he's a

00:10:21.237 --> 00:10:24.392
survivor.
The CEO will never let anybody

00:10:24.392 --> 00:10:27.450
be number two who's smarter than
he is.

00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:32.094
So, by definition,
the assistant to the CEO is a

00:10:32.094 --> 00:10:38.044
little dumber than the CEO;
now this guy now is the

00:10:38.044 --> 00:10:40.509
assistant.
The board likes him;

00:10:40.509 --> 00:10:44.521
the CEO eventually retires and
they make this guy the CEO--the

00:10:44.521 --> 00:10:47.350
fraternity president we're
talking about.

00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:51.652
Now he's now the head guy--the
CEO--and he'll bring in a number

00:10:51.652 --> 00:10:55.745
two guy that's a little dumber
than he is because he doesn't

00:10:55.745 --> 00:10:58.769
want to be threatened.
So, by definition,

00:10:58.769 --> 00:11:01.210
we'll be run by morons pretty
soon.

00:11:01.210 --> 00:11:05.569
We're not too far from that
right now--from that point in

00:11:05.569 --> 00:11:13.259
our economic history.
This is a problem that we have.

00:11:13.259 --> 00:11:17.535
Now, we've been able to do okay
in this country and pretty well

00:11:17.535 --> 00:11:21.603
even with the fact that we're
badly managed because over the

00:11:21.603 --> 00:11:25.120
last twenty years we've had a
pretty free ride.

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:28.651
We've gotten from all over the
world--the whole global economy

00:11:28.651 --> 00:11:32.009
has been booming and we've been
able to get cheap goods and

00:11:32.009 --> 00:11:35.019
these cheap goods kept us from
having inflation.

00:11:35.019 --> 00:11:38.323
Very simply put--if you don't
have inflation,

00:11:38.323 --> 00:11:42.378
it's easy for the Federal
Reserve to keep pumping money

00:11:42.378 --> 00:11:47.160
into an economy;
so, money kept flowing.

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:50.381
You were sort of in a punchbowl.
The country was at a party and

00:11:50.381 --> 00:11:53.258
we kept drinking from this
punchbowl, enjoying ourselves,

00:11:53.258 --> 00:11:55.929
and the rest of the world would
take our dollars.

00:11:55.929 --> 00:11:58.673
They would take our dollars
because everybody thought,

00:11:58.673 --> 00:12:02.747
oh, America--it's great.
It's a little bit like you came

00:12:02.747 --> 00:12:08.113
from some town and there's one
family in the town that doesn't

00:12:08.113 --> 00:12:11.280
do much work--sort of
propagates.

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:13.100
We'll all lie around the pool;
have fun;

00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:15.269
party;
eat a lot;

00:12:15.269 --> 00:12:18.639
have the big cars and have the
good times.

00:12:18.639 --> 00:12:22.230
The rest of the town works hard
on the farms or wherever they

00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:26.059
are and they keep bringing stuff
to this rich family's estate.

00:12:26.059 --> 00:12:28.330
They give them whatever they
want;

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:30.773
they give them food;
they give them clothing,

00:12:30.773 --> 00:12:32.370
but, you know,
anything.

00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:35.598
The rich family just gives them
IOUs and they keep taking the

00:12:35.598 --> 00:12:39.042
IOUs, so the rich family doesn't
do anything--just lie around the

00:12:39.042 --> 00:12:42.056
pool and have fun and travel or
whatever--and everybody's

00:12:42.056 --> 00:12:44.035
working.
Well, one day a few of these

00:12:44.035 --> 00:12:46.529
people are going to say,
I don't want your IOUs anymore.

00:12:46.529 --> 00:12:48.259
What the hell am I going to
take your IOUs?

00:12:48.259 --> 00:12:50.899
They're worthless because you
lost all your money.

00:12:50.899 --> 00:12:54.730
Well, our country--think about
it--is a bit in that situation.

00:12:54.730 --> 00:12:57.390
We've been giving our IOUs,
which are dollar bills,

00:12:57.390 --> 00:13:00.370
to the rest of the world and
taking their cheap goods.

00:13:00.370 --> 00:13:04.964
However, we're reaching a point
now where the dollar--as you've

00:13:04.964 --> 00:13:09.484
been reading if you're attuned
to it--the dollar's devaluating

00:13:09.484 --> 00:13:12.224
as we speak.
We've got, I believe,

00:13:12.224 --> 00:13:15.480
a real problem on our hands in
the economy.

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:17.803
The other thing we've done in
the last five,

00:13:17.803 --> 00:13:20.721
ten years--and I know Bob
Shiller's been talking to you

00:13:20.721 --> 00:13:24.038
about this--is housing.
Housing is like tulip bulbs,

00:13:24.038 --> 00:13:26.907
almost.
There was a big crisis in

00:13:26.907 --> 00:13:32.517
Holland in the 1600s on tulip
bulbs--but I like reading about

00:13:32.517 --> 00:13:35.376
this crisis,
because everybody bought tulip

00:13:35.376 --> 00:13:37.997
bulbs--thought it was the
greatest until one guy looked

00:13:37.997 --> 00:13:39.593
and says,
hey what the hell am I doing

00:13:39.593 --> 00:13:42.062
with this tulip bulb?
And all of a sudden he had a

00:13:42.062 --> 00:13:44.737
crisis.
Well, I'm not going to get into

00:13:44.737 --> 00:13:46.863
the depth of it,
but our banks,

00:13:46.863 --> 00:13:50.761
because they wanted to make
more and more money--and our

00:13:50.761 --> 00:13:54.250
investment bank,
Wall Street--kept issuing

00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:58.490
different paper against
mortgages so it made it simple

00:13:58.490 --> 00:14:02.603
to give a mortgage.
These mortgages were given out

00:14:02.603 --> 00:14:07.466
to people that couldn't afford
them and today you have what you

00:14:07.466 --> 00:14:10.840
call subprime
mortgages--subprime paper.

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:13.672
They issued against this paper
stuff called mortgage-backed

00:14:13.672 --> 00:14:15.940
security.
They securitized them and these

00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:17.950
things are all floating around
now.

00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:21.220
There's maybe about three
trillion dollars worth of stuff

00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:24.688
backed by mortgages out there.
Well, as you've seen,

00:14:24.688 --> 00:14:29.026
these have produced crisis of
confidence and I don't think

00:14:29.026 --> 00:14:32.976
we've heard the last of it.
The government sort of bailed

00:14:32.976 --> 00:14:36.366
out the situation by having JP
Morgan take over Bear Stearns

00:14:36.366 --> 00:14:39.470
and I'm not going to get into
the depth of it here,

00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:41.360
but it's a real fascinating
story.

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:47.864
In any event,
we have problems in our economy

00:14:47.864 --> 00:14:56.882
and I think that we are going to
see more of these problems in

00:14:56.882 --> 00:15:02.613
the next year or so.
I think Bob can talk to you

00:15:02.613 --> 00:15:06.170
more about what's going to
happen in housing,

00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:11.103
but a lot of it depends on that
because if you can't have your

00:15:11.103 --> 00:15:15.778
housing prices go back up,
a lot of people that bought

00:15:15.778 --> 00:15:18.990
them can't afford to pay the
mortgages;

00:15:18.990 --> 00:15:22.309
nor will they want to.
If they see the homes go down

00:15:22.309 --> 00:15:25.399
in value, they're going to just
say--they're going to walk away.

00:15:25.399 --> 00:15:29.687
Now, if that happens,
these homes are the collateral

00:15:29.687 --> 00:15:34.228
to the banks for all these
mortgages and we're going to

00:15:34.228 --> 00:15:38.600
have--and probably do have
already--a recession.

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:43.056
That recession could become a
lot more acute because

00:15:43.056 --> 00:15:47.862
today--I'm not going--I'm going
to open it for questions

00:15:47.862 --> 00:15:51.986
soon--but today,
there are six trillion dollars

00:15:51.986 --> 00:15:56.501
more of debt in this economy
than I believe it can sustain

00:15:56.501 --> 00:16:01.174
because everyone--the middle
class went on a borrowing binge

00:16:01.174 --> 00:16:05.610
over the last few years to buy
these homes and to buy for

00:16:05.610 --> 00:16:10.362
any--with the credit cards and
go buy anything they felt like

00:16:10.362 --> 00:16:12.500
buying.
As a result,

00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:16.710
I'm not certain that they can
pay that six trillion back.

00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:24.377
But, even if they can,
they're not going to be willing

00:16:24.377 --> 00:16:30.036
to go buy more things.
As you have that happening and

00:16:30.036 --> 00:16:32.806
you have inflation,
the earnings of our

00:16:32.806 --> 00:16:36.998
corporations will go down.
They estimate--I've talked to

00:16:36.998 --> 00:16:40.940
one or two very good economists
in the last few weeks.

00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:44.136
They estimate that earnings of
the S&amp;P averages will go

00:16:44.136 --> 00:16:49.629
down about 20% in the next year.
With that, the stock market is

00:16:49.629 --> 00:16:53.250
at, I would say,
a precipice;

00:16:53.250 --> 00:16:55.009
you don't know which way it's
going to go.

00:16:55.009 --> 00:16:57.943
With all that said,
you have to worry about all

00:16:57.943 --> 00:17:01.387
these things and I know you're
studying this and you're

00:17:01.387 --> 00:17:04.914
learning about it.
But, I think there will be

00:17:04.914 --> 00:17:09.572
great opportunities ahead for
you and the ability for Wall

00:17:09.572 --> 00:17:14.720
Street to again securitize and
buy a lot of these companies.

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:17.181
If you have capital,
you'll be able to buy these

00:17:17.181 --> 00:17:20.238
bonds.
So, I do tell you that I think

00:17:20.238 --> 00:17:25.690
Wall Street is certainly a good
area if you're thinking about a

00:17:25.690 --> 00:17:28.410
career.
I still think it's a very good

00:17:28.410 --> 00:17:32.214
area, but I'm not going to tell
you if you love to write or you

00:17:32.214 --> 00:17:35.650
love to play the cello to go and
come to Wall Street.

00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:40.109
I do think it's a good career.
I think it makes sense.

00:17:40.109 --> 00:17:45.397
I think that corporate America
is learning from this and I

00:17:45.397 --> 00:17:50.313
think we're going to make our
top management much more

00:17:50.313 --> 00:17:55.152
accountable in the years ahead.
There are tremendous abuses in

00:17:55.152 --> 00:17:59.471
corporate America today.
Your CEO makes 400 times what

00:17:59.471 --> 00:18:05.660
the average worker makes and
he's just simply not worth it.

00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:10.296
The reason you have this is
that you have no

00:18:10.296 --> 00:18:16.119
accountability--that
shareholders simply don't vote;

00:18:16.119 --> 00:18:18.591
they don't care about voting
and there's a whole reason for

00:18:18.591 --> 00:18:20.174
that.
You have an interesting

00:18:20.174 --> 00:18:22.799
relation with the owners of a
lot of our stocks,

00:18:22.799 --> 00:18:26.206
which are the mutual funds and
institutions that don't like to

00:18:26.206 --> 00:18:29.998
vote against these managers.
However, someone like me and a

00:18:29.998 --> 00:18:33.766
few other activists do get a
vote now and we do get a proxy

00:18:33.766 --> 00:18:36.161
fight going and we'll see,
for instance,

00:18:36.161 --> 00:18:37.813
what happens to
Motorola--that's what we're

00:18:37.813 --> 00:18:40.639
doing as we speak.
I think that that will give an

00:18:40.639 --> 00:18:44.304
opportunity for young people
like yourselves to get into

00:18:44.304 --> 00:18:46.370
corporations in our country.

00:18:51.599 --> 00:18:54.501
While I think Princeton is
the--might be a little better

00:18:54.501 --> 00:18:56.769
than Yale--I think Yale is a
good school.

00:18:56.769 --> 00:19:03.961
I think that all of you are
really probably the top,

00:19:03.961 --> 00:19:10.869
top, top of the student bodies
in this country.

00:19:10.869 --> 00:19:15.263
Going ahead in your lives,
I think that the corporations

00:19:15.263 --> 00:19:19.977
might be a good place to look or
Wall Street for that matter

00:19:19.977 --> 00:19:25.170
because I think there's going to
be a need for bright people.

00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:30.775
I think that you'll be able to
be rewarded for it in the fact

00:19:30.775 --> 00:19:34.700
that there will be
accountability again.

00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:38.569
Well, when I say "again"--there
never really was accountability.

00:19:38.569 --> 00:19:42.663
So, I think there will be a
true corporate democracy that

00:19:42.663 --> 00:19:47.123
will have to evolve so that we
can become competitive with the

00:19:47.123 --> 00:19:50.804
rest of the world again.
With that, I'll just

00:19:50.804 --> 00:19:54.481
basically--I think,
Bob, just leave it open to

00:19:54.481 --> 00:19:57.750
questions and see if anybody has
any.

00:19:57.750 --> 00:20:03.819
Student: You mentioned
in 1962 you kind of blew up.

00:20:03.819 --> 00:20:10.426
After that entire debacle
ensued, how did you regain your

00:20:10.426 --> 00:20:14.517
confidence?
I guess, most importantly,

00:20:14.517 --> 00:20:19.631
how did you regain--or
gain--the confidence of future

00:20:19.631 --> 00:20:21.163
investors?
Mr.

00:20:21.163 --> 00:20:23.230
Carl Icahn: Well,
you asked a few questions.

00:20:23.230 --> 00:20:25.359
I mean, how did you gain
confidence?

00:20:25.359 --> 00:20:28.266
I don't think I ever lost
confidence in my ability to

00:20:28.266 --> 00:20:32.646
understand what was going on.
I just learned that you have to

00:20:32.646 --> 00:20:37.342
really work at something and
understand it and little by

00:20:37.342 --> 00:20:41.269
little--I mean,
it was sort of interesting.

00:20:41.269 --> 00:20:45.723
I'm a sort of an obsessive guy
and I work real hard all my

00:20:45.723 --> 00:20:48.544
life.
I really get into something and

00:20:48.544 --> 00:20:53.093
I really delve into it and when
I came up with what is a letter

00:20:53.093 --> 00:20:57.568
there at that time to people who
sold these options--they were

00:20:57.568 --> 00:21:00.430
wealthy people across the
country.

00:21:00.430 --> 00:21:02.356
It was sort of
interesting--it's not around

00:21:02.356 --> 00:21:04.880
today--but they would sell
options, calls on a stock.

00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:09.392
So, if you--if you're someone
who traded the market,

00:21:09.392 --> 00:21:14.701
you'd like to buy an option on
XYZ stock and wealthier people

00:21:14.701 --> 00:21:19.834
across the country would sell
these options--would you give

00:21:19.834 --> 00:21:22.420
you right.
Today, you have the CBOE;

00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:25.442
it's much more computerized.
But then, you would do what

00:21:25.442 --> 00:21:27.740
these--over-the-counter
transactions.

00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:32.555
I was really one of the first
to come in and say to people

00:21:32.555 --> 00:21:35.659
across the country,
rather than do it with your

00:21:35.659 --> 00:21:38.220
broker who doesn't really
understand this business,

00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:40.769
rather than sell it,
sell it with me.

00:21:40.769 --> 00:21:42.559
I was a broker--just sell with
me.

00:21:42.559 --> 00:21:45.440
Little by little,
people actually answered my ad.

00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:49.207
I would put out an ad and say,
get to see what the true prices

00:21:49.207 --> 00:21:52.603
are and what the real value
should be for that option if

00:21:52.603 --> 00:21:56.680
you're selling through Merrill
Lynch or you're selling with H,

00:21:56.680 --> 00:22:00.090
in those days--or whoever.
I'd get letters from all over

00:22:00.090 --> 00:22:03.874
the country and literally I'd
stay down on Wall Street until

00:22:03.874 --> 00:22:07.466
midnight calling people in
California that would write in

00:22:07.466 --> 00:22:11.315
for this letter and we built up
a big following because I was

00:22:11.315 --> 00:22:14.907
really--the rich can be--The
only real honest guy in that

00:22:14.907 --> 00:22:17.730
business because everybody--I
mean,

00:22:17.730 --> 00:22:20.416
not that they were dishonest,
but you know the brokers didn't

00:22:20.416 --> 00:22:22.008
care.
They'd get business back from

00:22:22.008 --> 00:22:24.411
who you sell it to.
I'm not saying that we did

00:22:24.411 --> 00:22:27.923
anything criminal or anything,
but nobody really cared to get

00:22:27.923 --> 00:22:30.029
the right price for these
people.

00:22:30.029 --> 00:22:34.072
So, by getting them the right
price, they would stay with me

00:22:34.072 --> 00:22:36.470
as customers for years and
years.

00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:41.440
So, we built it up and built it
up and then I got one assistant;

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:48.339
then I got another assistant
and I kept moving up the ladder.

00:22:48.339 --> 00:22:51.894
It took a lot of hard work and
perseverance and that's really

00:22:51.894 --> 00:22:54.783
where it went to.
From there, it was arbitrage

00:22:54.783 --> 00:22:57.433
and now what I do.
What was the second part of

00:22:57.433 --> 00:23:00.091
your question--I forgot?
Student: How did you

00:23:00.091 --> 00:23:02.713
regain confidence in your
investors and people who gave

00:23:02.713 --> 00:23:06.300
money to you?
Did you feel confident that you

00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:11.739
could get them to give you money
after you had kind of washed

00:23:11.739 --> 00:23:13.448
yourself out?
Mr.

00:23:13.448 --> 00:23:16.071
Carl Icahn: I told you that
we had that letter and that we

00:23:16.071 --> 00:23:18.592
were able to,
after the letter,

00:23:18.592 --> 00:23:24.951
have the--I don't know if you
heard me because I was sort of

00:23:24.951 --> 00:23:31.309
telling you that we put the
letter out and we just gave them

00:23:31.309 --> 00:23:34.160
a good thing.
Student: Thank you.

00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:35.842
Mr.
Carl Icahn: Okay,

00:23:35.842 --> 00:23:38.630
all right.
Student: Hi, Mr. Icahn.

00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:40.390
How are you?
Mr. Carl Icahn: Hi.

00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:42.490
Student: I'm Mark Kotter.
How are you?

00:23:42.490 --> 00:23:45.121
Actually, I have three
questions for you,

00:23:45.121 --> 00:23:47.490
but I'll start with the first
one.

00:23:47.490 --> 00:23:50.603
I watched the 60 Minutes
special on you recently and they

00:23:50.603 --> 00:23:53.519
tried to portray that there had
been kind of an evolution in

00:23:53.519 --> 00:23:56.402
your career.
They showed some bad press from

00:23:56.402 --> 00:24:00.588
the ‘80s with the TWA deal
and then they showed some good

00:24:00.588 --> 00:24:04.234
press recently with the
so-called Icahn Uplift and some

00:24:04.234 --> 00:24:08.308
of the political--I mean,
the corporate activism that

00:24:08.308 --> 00:24:11.457
you've been engaged in.
In that interview,

00:24:11.457 --> 00:24:15.882
you sort of insisted that you
hadn't changed at all and I was

00:24:15.882 --> 00:24:20.454
just curious if you had changed
and you didn't want to tell the

00:24:20.454 --> 00:24:24.509
reporter or if the media was
giving you a bad rap?

00:24:24.509 --> 00:24:25.839
Mr.
Carl Icahn: I can't hear

00:24:25.839 --> 00:24:27.560
the whole question,
but I haven't changed.

00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:33.510
I haven't changed at all.
They call me a raider;

00:24:33.510 --> 00:24:37.426
they call you an activist.
I mean, I haven't really--I

00:24:37.426 --> 00:24:43.369
think what we do though is very
helpful to all investors.

00:24:43.369 --> 00:24:45.956
I mean, I think that's the
point because when we get into

00:24:45.956 --> 00:24:47.573
the companies,
the stock goes up for

00:24:47.573 --> 00:24:50.822
everybody;
so, it really works out,

00:24:50.822 --> 00:24:54.510
but I've never changed what I
do.

00:24:54.510 --> 00:24:57.502
Student: Okay.
Actually I have two more

00:24:57.502 --> 00:25:00.341
questions.
The second question was about

00:25:00.341 --> 00:25:05.024
China and there was a special
report in the recent Economist

00:25:05.024 --> 00:25:09.230
talking about the ravenous
appetite that China has for

00:25:09.230 --> 00:25:14.378
natural resources right now.
I was curious what you thought

00:25:14.378 --> 00:25:19.183
the effect that would have on
global financial markets and

00:25:19.183 --> 00:25:21.611
your investing strategy?
Mr.

00:25:21.611 --> 00:25:22.319
Carl Icahn: Well,
yeah.

00:25:22.319 --> 00:25:33.660
I mean, China is a great buyer
of all of these commodities.

00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:36.849
The trouble with this country
is we don't have a lot of that.

00:25:36.849 --> 00:25:39.559
We don't have a lot of natural
resources to sell them.

00:25:39.559 --> 00:25:44.870
Your question really--what this
country does?

00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:47.809
We make software;
we make technology;

00:25:47.809 --> 00:25:49.849
we're innovative,
but so are they.

00:25:49.849 --> 00:25:54.155
So, what we really have to do
is become a lot more productive

00:25:54.155 --> 00:25:57.241
and we have to make our
companies a lot more

00:25:57.241 --> 00:26:01.531
competitive.
Today, I feel we're losing that

00:26:01.531 --> 00:26:03.382
edge.
While China is going to

00:26:03.382 --> 00:26:06.190
continue to buy things,
it doesn't mean they're going

00:26:06.190 --> 00:26:09.538
to buy them from us necessarily
even though the dollar has gone

00:26:09.538 --> 00:26:13.510
down a great deal.
Student: Thank you.

00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:17.123
This is my last question.
New York Times

00:26:17.123 --> 00:26:20.703
columnist, David Brooks,
gave a great commencement

00:26:20.703 --> 00:26:25.231
speech last year at Wake Forest
and he said he was a journalist

00:26:25.231 --> 00:26:28.518
who led a boring life and
observed interesting

00:26:28.518 --> 00:26:32.587
lives--people like you.
I was curious--he mentioned

00:26:32.587 --> 00:26:36.413
that a lot of the great people
that he'd met--successful

00:26:36.413 --> 00:26:39.821
people--had lots of pictures of
dead people on the

00:26:39.821 --> 00:26:43.160
walls--meaning that they had
conversations.

00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:45.777
He said nearly famous people
had pictures of themselves on

00:26:45.777 --> 00:26:48.487
the wall, truly famous people
had pictures of dead people on

00:26:48.487 --> 00:26:51.019
the walls.
I was curious if you had any

00:26:51.019 --> 00:26:54.663
pictures of great historical
figures or what historical

00:26:54.663 --> 00:26:58.037
figures inspired you or
influenced you on a regular

00:26:58.037 --> 00:26:58.914
basis?
Mr.

00:26:58.914 --> 00:26:59.809
Carl Icahn: That's a good
question.

00:26:59.809 --> 00:27:05.867
Well, one of the greatest
philosophers I ever read was

00:27:05.867 --> 00:27:12.039
Aristotle and I think his
Nicomachean Ethics,

00:27:12.039 --> 00:27:15.332
if you read it,
makes a great deal of

00:27:15.332 --> 00:27:20.912
sense--where you live with this
golden mean but at the end use

00:27:20.912 --> 00:27:24.161
your intellect.
I mean, now you have to really

00:27:24.161 --> 00:27:26.680
read him in depth to understand
what he's saying.

00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:31.772
Then there's a poem by Rudyard
Kipling I like,

00:27:31.772 --> 00:27:34.410
If;
I'm sure a lot of you read it.

00:27:34.410 --> 00:27:36.583
If you could keep your head
about you when all you are

00:27:36.583 --> 00:27:39.588
losing theirs.
I read that every once in a

00:27:39.588 --> 00:27:44.458
while and the code that we
follow that's really important

00:27:44.458 --> 00:27:49.763
to be able to meet the triumph
and disaster and not let either

00:27:49.763 --> 00:27:55.242
of those imposters--treat those
imposters just the same--meaning

00:27:55.242 --> 00:27:59.410
that if you're doing great,
don't think you're a genius.

00:27:59.410 --> 00:28:01.779
And if you're doing badly,
don't think the world comes to

00:28:01.779 --> 00:28:04.265
an end.
If you work hard--maybe it

00:28:04.265 --> 00:28:09.124
sounds trite--but if you work
hard and don't let your ego get

00:28:09.124 --> 00:28:11.860
ahead of you,
as so many people do when

00:28:11.860 --> 00:28:14.569
you're doing well,
and don't let yourself become

00:28:14.569 --> 00:28:17.740
too despondent if you're not
doing well for a while,

00:28:17.740 --> 00:28:24.089
then have faith in your own
ability and really work hard at

00:28:24.089 --> 00:28:28.140
whatever you do;
give it everything you have.

00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:32.778
If you can do all that,
I think the chances are that

00:28:32.778 --> 00:28:37.871
you're going to hit a lucky
streak because luck comes and

00:28:37.871 --> 00:28:40.551
goes.
If you have your health,

00:28:40.551 --> 00:28:45.203
luck comes and goes and realize
when you're doing really well

00:28:45.203 --> 00:28:49.117
that it's not just you.
Then, when you're not,

00:28:49.117 --> 00:28:52.460
it's not just you either.
So, I think that kind of thing.

00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:56.042
You should read that poem.
Student: I like the line

00:28:56.042 --> 00:28:58.692
where it's, if you can be in a
crowd but not lose the common

00:28:58.692 --> 00:29:00.325
touch--that's my favorite line.
Mr.

00:29:00.325 --> 00:29:01.694
Carl Icahn: That's right.
Student: That's a good

00:29:01.694 --> 00:29:01.958
one.
Mr.

00:29:01.958 --> 00:29:04.108
Carl Icahn: That's right.
If you can walk in a crowd and

00:29:04.108 --> 00:29:07.328
still not lose the--if you can
walk with kings and not lose the

00:29:07.328 --> 00:29:09.620
common touch.
You know it.

00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:16.054
I've never walked with kings
though, so I don't have to worry

00:29:16.054 --> 00:29:18.824
about losing the common touch
because I'm not walking with

00:29:18.824 --> 00:29:22.210
kings.
Student: Hi, Mr. Icahn.

00:29:22.210 --> 00:29:24.462
I have two questions.
My first question is,

00:29:24.462 --> 00:29:28.390
to what extent can investors
like us adopt your strategy of

00:29:28.390 --> 00:29:32.589
buying cheap and expecting the
value of a company to go up?

00:29:32.589 --> 00:29:33.650
Mr.
Carl Icahn: Well,

00:29:33.650 --> 00:29:35.889
I mean, that--I don't consider
that being--that's barely a

00:29:35.889 --> 00:29:38.642
strategy.
I think that when you buy

00:29:38.642 --> 00:29:42.589
something, the best is--that
sounds simple.

00:29:42.589 --> 00:29:46.162
It's not simple to buy,
generally, when everybody

00:29:46.162 --> 00:29:49.718
thinks you're wrong.
The more people that think

00:29:49.718 --> 00:29:52.817
you're wrong,
the better you're going to do

00:29:52.817 --> 00:29:56.702
in the long run.
That's how it works because at

00:29:56.702 --> 00:30:00.757
the end of the day,
when everybody is against you,

00:30:00.757 --> 00:30:05.320
everybody sort of stumbles.
So, it's very hard to do it

00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:08.864
psychologically,
but at certain times you're in

00:30:08.864 --> 00:30:13.410
between and you're not going to
get the benefit of that.

00:30:13.410 --> 00:30:20.226
It's the old gray but dark
philosophy that you should just

00:30:20.226 --> 00:30:25.136
look at value.
But, one of the things is when

00:30:25.136 --> 00:30:30.330
people have given up on a
company--that's the perfect

00:30:30.330 --> 00:30:32.866
time.
But, it doesn't always work

00:30:32.866 --> 00:30:35.890
because you have to be damn sure
you're right.

00:30:35.890 --> 00:30:40.226
I mean, sometimes everybody is
right but generally it's not

00:30:40.226 --> 00:30:45.740
true that they're right.
Generally, if you look at the

00:30:45.740 --> 00:30:53.249
total outlook on a company and
if everybody sort of is down on

00:30:53.249 --> 00:30:57.349
it, that's one to look at.
Student: Thank you.

00:30:57.349 --> 00:31:00.400
My second question is:
what, in your opinion these

00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:03.140
days, do CEOs need to do to be
successful?

00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:06.390
Do they need more education,
experience, industry knowledge?

00:31:06.390 --> 00:31:09.371
Mr.
Carl Icahn: I think the

00:31:09.371 --> 00:31:14.430
answer is that most of them have
to leave the company.

00:31:20.319 --> 00:31:29.152
To be a little fairer about it,
the CEOs of a lot of companies

00:31:29.152 --> 00:31:37.696
probably could do a good job,
but they're more into building

00:31:37.696 --> 00:31:43.309
up.
It's like the royal "we."

00:31:43.309 --> 00:31:47.297
It's more like the imperial CEO
and they build up a huge amount

00:31:47.297 --> 00:31:51.091
of people around them and they
very rarely get to the nub of

00:31:51.091 --> 00:31:53.839
the problem.
Some of them are probably okay;

00:31:53.839 --> 00:31:57.589
they're probably good guys,
but there's no accountability.

00:31:57.589 --> 00:32:00.144
It's like you go to school and
if you never have tests and

00:32:00.144 --> 00:32:02.832
nobody ever bothers you.
That's what really happens

00:32:02.832 --> 00:32:05.000
until they really hit the bad
times.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:08.700
I guess you could say I'm a bad
time;

00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:10.650
when I come in,
they don't like it too much.

00:32:10.650 --> 00:32:16.864
I think that the problem we
have today is--very

00:32:16.864 --> 00:32:23.349
simplistically--you don't have
true elections,

00:32:23.349 --> 00:32:27.369
so you can't--it's very hard to
get rid of the CEO even though

00:32:27.369 --> 00:32:31.269
you theoretically have the vote;
it's very hard to use the vote.

00:32:31.269 --> 00:32:35.475
I mean, can you imagine in a
political race that the senator

00:32:35.475 --> 00:32:39.822
is fighting--the incumbent is
fighting--for an election and he

00:32:39.822 --> 00:32:43.029
can take all the money out of
Washington.

00:32:43.029 --> 00:32:45.082
He can take it out of the
Treasury of the United States

00:32:45.082 --> 00:32:48.545
and the other guy can't.
It's completely set up and

00:32:48.545 --> 00:32:53.496
rigged for the CEO because
anybody coming in to fight

00:32:53.496 --> 00:32:57.019
them--they sue them to begin
with.

00:32:57.019 --> 00:33:00.538
They sue you to--they don't sue
me anymore too much because they

00:33:00.538 --> 00:33:05.113
know I'm not going away,
but they sue--they do not let

00:33:05.113 --> 00:33:11.789
you have--I could go into all
the different shark repellents,

00:33:11.789 --> 00:33:13.659
we call them,
but it's very,

00:33:13.659 --> 00:33:16.430
very difficult to beat off
these guys.

00:33:16.430 --> 00:33:19.330
I think that's going to change
in the next four or five years.

00:33:19.330 --> 00:33:22.384
That's what I was telling you.
And I think we're going to have

00:33:22.384 --> 00:33:25.979
a better corporate democracy,
which gives people with real

00:33:25.979 --> 00:33:29.700
talent who are really--with a
work ethic--a chance to really

00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:31.832
make it.
Student: Mr.

00:33:31.832 --> 00:33:35.909
Icahn, as you've touched upon,
we may be in the worst credit

00:33:35.909 --> 00:33:38.119
bubble in history,
currently.

00:33:38.119 --> 00:33:41.466
If you are right,
the upcoming debt deflation

00:33:41.466 --> 00:33:45.670
will be long and painful.
How would you recommend that

00:33:45.670 --> 00:33:49.970
investors protect their wealth
during this period to take

00:33:49.970 --> 00:33:53.809
advantage of upcoming investment
opportunities?

00:33:53.809 --> 00:33:56.115
Mr.
Carl Icahn: Well,

00:33:56.115 --> 00:34:00.895
it's hard to recommend how to
invest at this time without

00:34:00.895 --> 00:34:04.140
knowing how much capital you
have.

00:34:04.140 --> 00:34:10.070
I would be--again,
I've been here at a different

00:34:10.070 --> 00:34:13.390
arena.
We invest and we look for these

00:34:13.390 --> 00:34:16.967
opportunities now,
but I feel that you have to be

00:34:16.967 --> 00:34:19.650
certainly very careful right
now.

00:34:19.650 --> 00:34:23.942
You have to be very careful in
your investments even though the

00:34:23.942 --> 00:34:26.849
markets been going up the last
few days.

00:34:26.849 --> 00:34:30.295
I would be careful and not have
all your money invested in

00:34:30.295 --> 00:34:32.741
stocks.
I would look at a lot of these

00:34:32.741 --> 00:34:36.353
distressed debt--some of the
distressed debt that has gone

00:34:36.353 --> 00:34:39.171
down.
I don't know if you understand

00:34:39.171 --> 00:34:42.792
that, but some of the debt
that--even bank debt,

00:34:42.792 --> 00:34:47.570
which is the highest level,
I think, has become very cheap.

00:34:47.570 --> 00:34:50.501
So, that kind of stuff is
something to look at,

00:34:50.501 --> 00:34:53.369
but I'd be very careful in
buying equities.

00:34:53.369 --> 00:34:57.190
I mean, you certainly could
make a fortune buying them.

00:34:57.190 --> 00:35:01.919
I mean, I'm certainly not
telling you it's not going to

00:35:01.919 --> 00:35:05.510
work, but I think it's all
risk-reward.

00:35:05.510 --> 00:35:10.179
I would be looking at this--at
the debt areas.

00:35:10.179 --> 00:35:13.500
Student: You mentioned
about the U.S.

00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:15.579
dollar falling in value
recently.

00:35:15.579 --> 00:35:18.956
What kind of foreign currency
vehicles or trading would you

00:35:18.956 --> 00:35:21.809
recommend to kind of hedge a bet
against a dollar,

00:35:21.809 --> 00:35:24.079
assuming that it continues to
fall?

00:35:24.079 --> 00:35:25.707
Mr.
Carl Icahn: Yeah,

00:35:25.707 --> 00:35:28.840
I don't know much about
currencies and I really don't

00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:32.456
get into something I don't know
something about--or generally

00:35:32.456 --> 00:35:34.878
don't.
I don't play the currency

00:35:34.878 --> 00:35:38.412
market, unfortunately,
because currency has gone down

00:35:38.412 --> 00:35:42.230
so much.
I don't necessarily think that

00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:48.372
you should do that now because
it could theoretically turn in

00:35:48.372 --> 00:35:52.530
this country.
But, I'm only saying that it

00:35:52.530 --> 00:35:56.309
has become one of the
manifestations of our

00:35:56.309 --> 00:36:00.809
problem--the currency of the
dollar has fallen.

00:36:00.809 --> 00:36:02.842
You know you can't be that
[inaudible]

00:36:02.842 --> 00:36:04.710
about everything in Asia
either.

00:36:04.710 --> 00:36:07.630
Everybody loves Asia now and
loves China and loves all these

00:36:07.630 --> 00:36:10.750
countries, but you're going to
have some global problems too.

00:36:10.750 --> 00:36:16.160
So, I don't know that it's time
to rush out of the dollar.

00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:20.179
Student: Hi, Mr. Icahn.
One major criticism that one

00:36:20.179 --> 00:36:26.059
CEO against corporate activist
that they think activists don't

00:36:26.059 --> 00:36:30.590
think long-term interest of the
corporation;

00:36:30.590 --> 00:36:32.530
they just want to get money and
get out.

00:36:32.530 --> 00:36:34.688
How do you answer to that?
Mr.

00:36:34.688 --> 00:36:37.999
Carl Icahn: I would just
say that the facts don't bear

00:36:37.999 --> 00:36:40.090
that out as far as I'm
concerned.

00:36:40.090 --> 00:36:42.760
I mean, if you--I own quite a
few companies.

00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:47.373
Any company we got control of I
put literally hundreds of

00:36:47.373 --> 00:36:51.760
millions of dollars into them.
I mean, I bought a company in

00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:55.080
1985--a rail car company--we put
hundreds of millions;

00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:58.866
we still have the fleet.
I bought casinos and energy

00:36:58.866 --> 00:37:03.039
companies and over the years
kept them;

00:37:03.039 --> 00:37:05.809
sold them now,
but that's after ten years.

00:37:05.809 --> 00:37:09.489
So, any company that we've been
able to get control of I

00:37:09.489 --> 00:37:11.768
actually kept.
Because getting control is a

00:37:11.768 --> 00:37:13.790
great thing.
If you really believe that

00:37:13.790 --> 00:37:16.935
management's not doing well,
you can go and clean them up

00:37:16.935 --> 00:37:20.429
and put a good guy in,
So, we--I know they criticize

00:37:20.429 --> 00:37:23.024
you like that,
but that's part of the

00:37:23.024 --> 00:37:26.289
propaganda machine;
but it's just not the facts.

00:37:26.289 --> 00:37:31.374
Student: A related
question is that,

00:37:31.374 --> 00:37:36.943
what do you do when your
activist spirit is not

00:37:36.943 --> 00:37:41.060
appreciated,
as in the case of Motorola when

00:37:41.060 --> 00:37:45.070
you asked for a seat on the
board but just get declined?

00:37:45.070 --> 00:37:48.094
What's your next step?
Mr.

00:37:48.094 --> 00:37:52.994
Carl Icahn: Alright,
you have patience and now it's

00:37:52.994 --> 00:37:57.260
a year later and we'll see what
happens now.

00:37:57.260 --> 00:38:01.490
Motorola is a good example of
what I'm talking about.

00:38:01.490 --> 00:38:04.719
People don't like it;
they don't like the cell phone

00:38:04.719 --> 00:38:08.150
business, but I really think
that that business,

00:38:08.150 --> 00:38:11.515
if you look at Motorola and
study it, you're buying that

00:38:11.515 --> 00:38:15.789
whole business for nothing.
It's not reflected in the stock

00:38:15.789 --> 00:38:19.184
price, but they have to do it.
As I said publicly,

00:38:19.184 --> 00:38:20.880
take that business out of
Motorola;

00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:22.900
spin it off and give it to the
shareholders.

00:38:22.900 --> 00:38:25.559
I think, then,
you've got a real good value.

00:38:25.559 --> 00:38:28.279
What I'm saying is,
nobody likes it now,

00:38:28.279 --> 00:38:30.789
but hopefully I'm correct on
that.

00:38:30.789 --> 00:38:35.807
I really think by being an
activist and putting pressure on

00:38:35.807 --> 00:38:39.960
that board that has done
nothing, really--I think

00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:43.679
eventually that will happen,
hopefully.

00:38:43.679 --> 00:38:45.562
Professor Robert
Shiller: Maybe we'll have

00:38:45.562 --> 00:38:48.935
one or two more questions.
Two more questions and then

00:38:48.935 --> 00:38:51.639
we'll wrap up.
Mr. Carl Icahn: Okay.

00:38:51.639 --> 00:38:55.825
Student: Mr.
Icahn, why does the United

00:38:55.825 --> 00:39:00.940
States have bad corporate
governance and which countries

00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:03.470
have better models?
Mr.

00:39:03.470 --> 00:39:06.398
Carl Icahn: Alright,
we have bad corporate

00:39:06.398 --> 00:39:09.420
governance;
it's evolved into this.

00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:12.650
I don't think that Washington
understands how bad it is;

00:39:12.650 --> 00:39:16.479
nobody's really focused on it.
The different states--the way

00:39:16.479 --> 00:39:20.218
we're structured--the different
states want corporations to

00:39:20.218 --> 00:39:24.215
register and therefore the rules
are such that they protect the

00:39:24.215 --> 00:39:26.730
corporation with the poison
pills.

00:39:26.730 --> 00:39:29.774
I can't get into all these
different things--stagnant

00:39:29.774 --> 00:39:33.227
boards, poison pills--and I
think if you just change some of

00:39:33.227 --> 00:39:35.392
that we could be like,
for instance,

00:39:35.392 --> 00:39:39.442
England is much better.
Canada is much better--where

00:39:39.442 --> 00:39:43.429
you can--without getting into
details;

00:39:43.429 --> 00:39:48.269
I'll simplify this--where you
can't have fewer elections.

00:39:48.269 --> 00:39:51.709
The United States,
because of the way that it's

00:39:51.709 --> 00:39:56.270
structured in the states--the
division between the federal and

00:39:56.270 --> 00:40:00.980
the state governments--they have
not been able to really curtail

00:40:00.980 --> 00:40:04.487
some of the abuses.
But I think it will occur

00:40:04.487 --> 00:40:07.368
sooner or later,
especially if you have a bad

00:40:07.368 --> 00:40:09.869
recession.
Student: Hi, Mr. Icahn.

00:40:09.869 --> 00:40:13.564
You mentioned that you believe
that many companies are poorly

00:40:13.564 --> 00:40:15.784
managed.
Obviously you don't invest in

00:40:15.784 --> 00:40:18.275
every company,
so I was wondering what factors

00:40:18.275 --> 00:40:21.208
you look for in identifying
companies that you want to

00:40:21.208 --> 00:40:24.750
invest in and that you think are
especially poorly managed?

00:40:24.750 --> 00:40:25.669
Mr.
Carl Icahn: Okay,

00:40:25.669 --> 00:40:27.610
we look at a lot of the--we
look at a lot of companies.

00:40:27.610 --> 00:40:30.385
Obviously, I have a whole group
of people here that do that and

00:40:30.385 --> 00:40:32.982
I have a bunch of lawyers that
look at all the covenants in

00:40:32.982 --> 00:40:35.489
these companies and their bylaws
and their charters.

00:40:35.489 --> 00:40:42.194
But really, some of them become
very apparent and when you look

00:40:42.194 --> 00:40:46.986
at them you can understand.
And you have to see that in

00:40:46.986 --> 00:40:50.999
relation to the economy.
Some of these companies--it's

00:40:50.999 --> 00:40:56.129
just apparent that the value of
these companies would be much

00:40:56.129 --> 00:41:01.344
better if they were better run
or they just simply did certain

00:41:01.344 --> 00:41:04.849
things like breaking--like
Motorola,

00:41:04.849 --> 00:41:06.469
as an example,
if they just broke it up.

00:41:06.469 --> 00:41:10.511
In some biotech companies that
we're involved now,

00:41:10.511 --> 00:41:14.139
there's a need for them by the
big Pharma.

00:41:14.139 --> 00:41:18.200
The big Pharma hasn't really
done research for years but then

00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:22.328
he married in the biotech area
and therefore biotech companies

00:41:22.328 --> 00:41:27.219
aren't that well run,
but they spent a great deal in

00:41:27.219 --> 00:41:31.380
research for the large molecule
drugs.

00:41:31.380 --> 00:41:35.175
And so, therefore,
you look at these and some of

00:41:35.175 --> 00:41:40.262
them become quite apparent after
you're doing them for years and

00:41:40.262 --> 00:41:43.170
years.
I've done them a lot of--it's

00:41:43.170 --> 00:41:47.300
almost--after you do all the
work, it's almost instinct.

00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:51.939
The risk could be moderate.
Just ask--it's like asking some

00:41:51.939 --> 00:41:54.899
real great tennis player,
well why did you move here

00:41:54.899 --> 00:41:57.282
instead of there?
Or a football player--when

00:41:57.282 --> 00:41:59.914
you're running down the field,
why did you go to this way

00:41:59.914 --> 00:42:02.640
instead of that way when you're
running down the field?

00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:05.309
I don't think he could tell you;
it's just sort of instinct why

00:42:05.309 --> 00:42:08.725
you do it.
That's after a lot of work on

00:42:08.725 --> 00:42:10.502
it.
Professor Robert

00:42:10.502 --> 00:42:14.692
Shiller: Well I think this
has been a very enlightening

00:42:14.692 --> 00:42:18.159
talk and Carl,
I want to thank you very much.

00:42:18.159 --> 00:42:21.764
Mr.
Carl Icahn: Thank you for

00:42:21.764 --> 00:42:22.764
having me.

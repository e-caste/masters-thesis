00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:04.415
Prof: On to the topic of
today's lecture,

00:00:04.415 --> 00:00:07.170
and today's lecture is:
the importance of George

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:08.050
Washington.
 

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:11.440
We're going to be talking about
George Washington today.

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.418
And in a sense,
what I'm going to be talking

00:00:13.418 --> 00:00:16.133
about is exactly what it sounds
like I'm going to be talking

00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:18.221
about,
which is looking at what in a

00:00:18.221 --> 00:00:21.440
sense you could call the
phenomenon of George Washington,

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:21.862
right?
 

00:00:21.862 --> 00:00:25.590
His reputation--his exalted
reputation--and importance

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.897
during his lifetime,
and some of the reasons why

00:00:28.897 --> 00:00:31.430
both of those things were true.
 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.459
What is it that he was doing,
or what was it about him,

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:37.488
that made him stand out in the
way that he did then and

00:00:37.488 --> 00:00:39.620
actually in a sense forever
after?

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.536
But we're going to be looking
really during his lifetime,

00:00:42.536 --> 00:00:45.400
what was it about Washington
that made him stand out.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.094
And in a sense,
this lecture sort of represents

00:00:48.094 --> 00:00:51.140
a little bit of a turn in this
course as a whole,

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.060
because you'll be getting a
sense of Washington today,

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.348
and that will be important to
have sort of under our belts for

00:00:57.348 --> 00:00:59.290
the next two lectures after
this,

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:02.627
because then we will actually
be looking at fighting battles

00:01:02.627 --> 00:01:03.250
and such.
 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.716
We will actually be looking at
how the war was fought in a

00:01:05.716 --> 00:01:08.262
really literal way,
so obviously I want us all to

00:01:08.262 --> 00:01:11.778
have a sense of George before we
venture up and watch to see what

00:01:11.778 --> 00:01:14.250
George is doing as the war gets
under way.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.349
So I've divided that into two
lectures.

00:01:16.349 --> 00:01:19.430
It's--Thursday and Tuesday is
when we'll be talking about how

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.241
the war was fought,
and then in the end really how

00:01:22.241 --> 00:01:25.587
the war was won--
and today is kind of the segue

00:01:25.587 --> 00:01:26.290
lecture.
 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.858
I also want to mention
something because by dumb luck

00:01:28.858 --> 00:01:31.674
it was in the New York Times
this morning and I was

00:01:31.674 --> 00:01:33.774
reading it and it's--
hardly ever do I read the

00:01:33.774 --> 00:01:35.976
New York Times and say,
"Oh, I must mention that

00:01:35.976 --> 00:01:37.414
in my American Revolution
course,"

00:01:37.414 --> 00:01:38.360
but it happened today.
 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.075
In the Arts section,
I guess, there's an article on

00:01:42.075 --> 00:01:43.190
a collection.
 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.970
Did any of you see this?
 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:45.819
Did any of you happen to look
at the New York Times?

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:46.730
Nobody.
 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:47.061
Wow.
 

00:01:47.061 --> 00:01:48.800
I feel so informed.
 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.221
[laughs]
There was an article in the

00:01:51.221 --> 00:01:55.580
arts section on a collection of
letters between British military

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.043
figures and sort of--
and officials to each other,

00:01:59.043 --> 00:02:02.510
not back to the officials in
London but the newspaper,

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:04.132
the Times,
calls them sort of

00:02:04.132 --> 00:02:06.588
back-channel letters from
throughout the Revolutionary

00:02:06.588 --> 00:02:06.959
War.
 

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:09.223
And what's interesting about
the letters: It's not new

00:02:09.223 --> 00:02:11.445
information but it's sort of
wonderfully ground-level

00:02:11.445 --> 00:02:12.128
information.
 

00:02:12.128 --> 00:02:14.169
It's all of these people
writing to each other from

00:02:14.169 --> 00:02:16.250
throughout the war in one way or
another saying,

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.358
'Oh, we're in big trouble,'
[laughs]

00:02:18.358 --> 00:02:20.164
--
the British from very early on

00:02:20.164 --> 00:02:23.210
in the war saying,
'I don't know.'

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:25.119
So at the same time that
they're writing back to London

00:02:25.119 --> 00:02:27.220
and reporting,
'Our military forces are strong

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.122
and we are supreme and we will
of course win this war for the

00:02:30.122 --> 00:02:33.122
greater glory of Britain and the
colonies will be back to where

00:02:33.122 --> 00:02:36.220
they should be,' they're writing
to each other and saying,

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.855
'I don't know.
 

00:02:36.855 --> 00:02:38.220
What do you think about this?
 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.865
Because this is really tricky,
and I don't know if we're going

00:02:40.865 --> 00:02:41.818
to be able to do it.
 

00:02:41.818 --> 00:02:43.090
I don't know if we can get
enough men here.

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:44.410
Logistically,
this is a disaster.

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:45.060
They hate us.
 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.068
It's hard to be hated.'
 

00:02:46.068 --> 00:02:48.060
It's all these really
interesting letters.

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.370
I'm sure you can go find it
online but--

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.014
and I'll mention it more when
I'm actually talking about the

00:02:53.014 --> 00:02:55.657
war and why the British are
doing what they're doing and the

00:02:55.657 --> 00:02:57.810
logic behind what the Americans
are doing,--

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.116
but I thought it was actually
really interesting that by just

00:03:01.116 --> 00:03:02.878
dumb luck that appeared today.
 

00:03:02.878 --> 00:03:05.542
And again, it's something
that--It's not a new

00:03:05.542 --> 00:03:07.944
realization,
but it's an interesting thing

00:03:07.944 --> 00:03:10.650
to be reminded of,
that as powerful as the British

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.915
Army is and as much as you would
assume at the time they would

00:03:13.915 --> 00:03:17.021
assume things are going to go
swimmingly and we're going to

00:03:17.021 --> 00:03:20.181
just sweep this up in no time,
there are all these sort of

00:03:20.181 --> 00:03:22.915
back-channel letters of people
on the ground who are actually

00:03:22.915 --> 00:03:25.470
in a sense being very realistic
about it and saying,

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:26.659
'This is really hard.
 

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:28.788
This is really tricky.
 

00:03:28.788 --> 00:03:31.626
I don't know if this is going
to work'--throughout the war in

00:03:31.626 --> 00:03:34.556
really sometimes sort of bemused
and sometimes really depressed

00:03:34.556 --> 00:03:35.030
tones.
 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:36.830
But anyway, more on that to
come.

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:40.690
For now I want us to turn to
George Washington.

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:45.147
Now, as a historian I have to
admit that this kind of lecture

00:03:45.147 --> 00:03:49.760
sometimes might make me nervous,
because as a historian it makes

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.068
me nervous to declare that one
person was crucial.

00:03:53.068 --> 00:03:55.870
That's the kind of declaration
historians don't like to make.

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.059
They like to say,
'Oh, well, history's

00:03:57.059 --> 00:03:57.509
complicated.
 

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:58.520
Events are complicated.
 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:02.098
They unfold in complicated
ways'--and all of that is true.

00:04:02.098 --> 00:04:05.302
That said, in many ways
Washington actually was crucial

00:04:05.302 --> 00:04:08.742
not just to the Revolutionary
War effort but equally if not

00:04:08.742 --> 00:04:11.590
more important,
as we're going to see later in

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.472
the course,
to the launching of the new

00:04:13.472 --> 00:04:14.979
government under the
Constitution.

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:18.428
I'll talk a little bit more
about that in the last lectures

00:04:18.428 --> 00:04:21.005
of this course--
but in one way or another

00:04:21.005 --> 00:04:24.439
Washington ends up being really
crucial in this period,

00:04:24.439 --> 00:04:27.389
and one of the central reasons
why that's true--

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:30.211
and it's a theme I'm going to
come back to at a few different

00:04:30.211 --> 00:04:32.800
points in a few different ways
in the lecture today--

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.279
is because people trusted him
with power.

00:04:36.279 --> 00:04:38.803
We're going to look today
partly at why they trust him

00:04:38.803 --> 00:04:40.904
with power--
but in one way or another

00:04:40.904 --> 00:04:44.060
throughout this period people
trusted him with power,

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:48.406
and in an age and among a
people who were really wary

00:04:48.406 --> 00:04:50.641
about power,
about tyranny,

00:04:50.641 --> 00:04:53.240
about where power was being
placed,

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.033
this is a very big deal to be
the person that people trust

00:04:57.033 --> 00:04:57.899
with power.
 

00:04:57.899 --> 00:04:58.920
It matters a lot.
 

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:02.959
And in a sense,
the deployment of power,

00:05:02.959 --> 00:05:05.649
the holding of power,
being entrusted with power,

00:05:05.649 --> 00:05:08.653
is sort of the central crucial
issue with Washington's

00:05:08.653 --> 00:05:09.389
importance.
 

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:12.617
I think--again--the Revolution
and the presidency have sort of

00:05:12.617 --> 00:05:15.370
this key thing about him that
makes him different.

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.750
Really, he is in many
ways--particularly when he

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:20.925
becomes the first President--
the only person people could

00:05:20.925 --> 00:05:24.139
think of trusting in that role
of having extreme power.

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:26.680
And part of what I'm going to
be talking about today is why?

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:27.589
Why is that true?
 

00:05:27.589 --> 00:05:29.040
Why is he such a trusted
character?

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:32.399
What did he do to be so trusted?
 

00:05:32.399 --> 00:05:35.401
And it's--something he's
particularly skilled at is not

00:05:35.401 --> 00:05:38.904
just holding positions of power
but managing to have power while

00:05:38.904 --> 00:05:41.908
also calming people's fears
about what that power might

00:05:41.908 --> 00:05:42.519
mean.
 

00:05:42.519 --> 00:05:43.031
Okay.
 

00:05:43.031 --> 00:05:47.940
Now in a sense when we think
about Washington,

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:50.956
Washington--I always feel he
gets sort of gypped in the long

00:05:50.956 --> 00:05:53.187
run with history,
not because we don't remember

00:05:53.187 --> 00:05:55.440
him or not because we don't
honor George Washington,

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.269
but because he's sort of a
nonperson.

00:05:57.269 --> 00:06:00.281
He's sort of this block of
marble who sort of glides

00:06:00.281 --> 00:06:02.228
through history like:
'well, yeah,

00:06:02.228 --> 00:06:04.353
I fought a war,
became the President,

00:06:04.353 --> 00:06:05.889
went home and died.'
 

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:08.338
George Washington,
the guy--he doesn't get to be a

00:06:08.338 --> 00:06:09.040
real person.
 

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:12.028
He's just sort of almost a
symbol to us--

00:06:12.028 --> 00:06:14.480
and then I suppose that even at
the time in some ways,

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:15.689
as we're going to hear in the
end of the lecture,

00:06:15.689 --> 00:06:17.420
even then he's a little bit of
a symbol--

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:20.324
but we don't think of him very
often as a person with

00:06:20.324 --> 00:06:23.391
insecurities and ambitions,
as a person with political

00:06:23.391 --> 00:06:25.959
savvy--he actually was very
politically savvy--

00:06:25.959 --> 00:06:30.370
as a person with specific
political ideas and ideals,

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:30.639
right?
 

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:33.250
We don't tend to even attribute
many ideas to him at all.

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:35.656
We just think of him as capital
"L"

00:06:35.656 --> 00:06:38.230
leader, but in fact he's all of
these things.

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:40.319
He is a person and all that
that entails.

00:06:40.319 --> 00:06:45.656
That said, even during his
lifetime, he was already being

00:06:45.656 --> 00:06:47.850
shaped into a legend.
 

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:48.235
Right?
 

00:06:48.235 --> 00:06:50.942
The title "Father of His
Country"

00:06:50.942 --> 00:06:54.485
is a title that was given to
him even before the country

00:06:54.485 --> 00:06:55.839
finally existed.
 

00:06:55.839 --> 00:06:58.216
The Revolution's not over yet,
and some people are calling him

00:06:58.216 --> 00:07:00.851
Father of His Country,
so this happens pretty--at a

00:07:00.851 --> 00:07:02.930
pretty early point to
Washington,

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:05.050
that he ascends into this
position.

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:08.889
Now as I'm sure you've gathered
by this time in the course,

00:07:08.889 --> 00:07:12.348
John Adams is a little jealous
of other people who appear to be

00:07:12.348 --> 00:07:16.240
getting the glory,
credit, and fame that he thinks

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:19.452
he deserves,
and not surprisingly he's a

00:07:19.452 --> 00:07:23.636
little irked at Washington's
incredible sort of renown and

00:07:23.636 --> 00:07:26.720
status and fame and how beloved
he is,

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:29.910
as it developed between the
Revolution and the 1790s.

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:35.233
To Adams, Washington is just so
revered--and he writes this

00:07:35.233 --> 00:07:36.060
letter.
 

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:37.709
I'm going to read a piece of it
here.

00:07:37.709 --> 00:07:39.892
Once again, Benjamin Rush,
who keeps appearing and

00:07:39.892 --> 00:07:41.230
disappearing in this course.
 

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:44.339
He and Adams write these
amazing--Just in the same way

00:07:44.339 --> 00:07:47.742
that Jefferson and Adams write
amazing letters in their old

00:07:47.742 --> 00:07:49.884
age,
Adams and Rush do the same

00:07:49.884 --> 00:07:50.319
thing.
 

00:07:50.319 --> 00:07:51.940
They write these really great
letters to each other.

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:54.238
They're published in a book
called The Spur of Fame,

00:07:54.238 --> 00:07:55.600
I think is the name of it.
 

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:58.420
They're really fascinating and
really interesting and this is

00:07:58.420 --> 00:07:59.079
one of them.
 

00:07:59.079 --> 00:08:02.473
And Adams writes it in 1807,
so it's a few years after

00:08:02.473 --> 00:08:05.454
Washington died--
he died in 1799--and they're

00:08:05.454 --> 00:08:09.550
talking about Washington clearly
in an exchange of letters here.

00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:12.754
And Adams--Clearly one of the
things that irks him is that

00:08:12.754 --> 00:08:15.564
Washington wasn't as
book-learned as Adams and many

00:08:15.564 --> 00:08:17.420
of their contemporaries were.
 

00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:17.649
Right?
 

00:08:17.649 --> 00:08:19.569
He's someone who doesn't have a
formal education.

00:08:19.569 --> 00:08:21.800
He's not thinking about
Aristotle.

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:24.125
He's not thinking about the
things that Adams thinks people

00:08:24.125 --> 00:08:26.290
should be thinking about if
they're great statesmen.

00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:30.279
So here in this letter he tries
to come up with the top ten

00:08:30.279 --> 00:08:33.788
talents that Washington had that
made him great,

00:08:33.788 --> 00:08:36.538
none of them having anything to
do with book learning.

00:08:36.538 --> 00:08:36.779
Right?
 

00:08:36.779 --> 00:08:38.465
It's like, okay,
so if he doesn't have book

00:08:38.465 --> 00:08:40.149
learning, what are the top ten
talents?

00:08:40.149 --> 00:08:43.198
It's David Letterman-esque:
the top ten talents of George

00:08:43.198 --> 00:08:45.158
Washington that made him so
great.

00:08:45.158 --> 00:08:49.070
So this is Adams' description:
"Talents!

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:51.330
you will say, what Talents?
 

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:55.129
I answer, number one--an
handsome Face.

00:08:55.129 --> 00:08:57.004
[laughter]
That this is a Talent,

00:08:57.004 --> 00:09:00.402
I can prove by the authority of
a thousand Instances in all

00:09:00.402 --> 00:09:00.929
ages.
 

00:09:00.929 --> 00:09:02.450
Number two.
 

00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:05.225
A tall stature,
like the Hebrew sovereign

00:09:05.225 --> 00:09:09.600
chosen because he was taller by
the Head than the other Jews.

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:11.690
Number three,
an elegant Form."

00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:13.520
[laughter]
You can see where this is

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:13.940
going.
 

00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:16.340
"Number four,
Graceful Attitudes and

00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:17.059
Movements.
 

00:09:17.059 --> 00:09:19.058
Number five.
 

00:09:19.058 --> 00:09:21.706
A large imposing Fortune
consisting of a great landed

00:09:21.706 --> 00:09:24.100
Estate left him by his Father
and Brother ...

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:26.908
and in addition to this immense
tracts of land of his own

00:09:26.908 --> 00:09:27.610
acquisition.
 

00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:30.283
There is nothing,
except bloody Battles and

00:09:30.283 --> 00:09:33.785
splendid Victories to which
Mankind bowed down with more

00:09:33.785 --> 00:09:36.269
reverence than to great
fortune....

00:09:36.269 --> 00:09:37.019
Number six.
 

00:09:37.019 --> 00:09:38.798
Washington was a Virginian.
 

00:09:38.798 --> 00:09:40.830
This is equivalent to five
Talents.

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:46.240
[laughter]
Virginian Geese are all Swans.

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:48.715
Not a Bearne in Scotland is
more national,

00:09:48.715 --> 00:09:52.096
not a Lad upon the High Lands
is more clannish than every

00:09:52.096 --> 00:09:54.210
Virginian I have ever known....
 

00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:54.388
7.
 

00:09:54.388 --> 00:09:58.678
Washington was preceded by
favorable Anecdotes.

00:09:58.678 --> 00:10:01.960
The English had used him ill in
the expedition of Braddock,

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:03.940
during the French and Indian
War.

00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:06.788
They had not done Justice to
his Bravery and good Council.

00:10:06.788 --> 00:10:09.139
They had exaggerated and
misrepresented his defeat..

00:10:09.139 --> 00:10:11.984
.which interested the Pride as
well as compassion of Americans

00:10:11.984 --> 00:10:12.870
in his favour....
 

00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:16.183
Number eight,
he possessed the Gift of

00:10:16.183 --> 00:10:17.080
Silence.
 

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:19.700
This I esteem as one of the
most precious Talents."

00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:22.246
I think that's partly because
Adams does not possess the gift

00:10:22.246 --> 00:10:22.798
of silence.
 

00:10:22.798 --> 00:10:26.034
[laughs]
"Number nine--he had great

00:10:26.034 --> 00:10:27.278
Self Command.
 

00:10:27.278 --> 00:10:30.524
It cost him a great exertion
sometimes, and a constant

00:10:30.524 --> 00:10:33.952
Constraint, but to preserve so
much equanimity as he did,

00:10:33.952 --> 00:10:35.788
required a great Capacity.
 

00:10:35.788 --> 00:10:39.500
Number ten, whenever he lost
his temper as he did sometimes,

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:42.610
either Love or fear in those
about him induced them to

00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:44.840
conceal his Weakness from the
World.

00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:47.841
Here you see I've made out ten
Talents without saying a word

00:10:47.841 --> 00:10:50.029
about Reading,
Thinking or writing."

00:10:50.029 --> 00:10:53.308
Ooh, thank you, John Adams.
 

00:10:53.308 --> 00:10:53.551
Okay.
 

00:10:53.551 --> 00:10:56.019
So he's being a little bit
snarky in that letter,

00:10:56.019 --> 00:10:59.061
saying that Washington looked
like and behaved like a great

00:10:59.061 --> 00:11:02.225
leader and was from Virginia,
and so he was treated like a

00:11:02.225 --> 00:11:02.970
great leader.
 

00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:06.548
There was actually some truth
to what he's saying.

00:11:06.548 --> 00:11:08.960
I'm going to talk a little bit
about that today.

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:12.320
And, as Adams suggests,
it's true that Washington

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:16.308
didn't have the same sort of
formal education that someone

00:11:16.308 --> 00:11:19.740
like Jefferson or Madison or
even Adams had,

00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:23.278
but he was more than a man who
just looked the part.

00:11:23.278 --> 00:11:27.985
Now it is true that in some
ways Washington was sort of like

00:11:27.985 --> 00:11:30.460
any other Virginia gentleman.
 

00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:33.529
As Adams says,
he's a large landowner.

00:11:33.529 --> 00:11:36.184
He had inherited his estate,
Mount Vernon,

00:11:36.184 --> 00:11:39.230
from his father and then
enlarged it himself.

00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:42.769
Like a lot of other Virginia
gentlemen he was a skilled

00:11:42.769 --> 00:11:46.308
horseman, which was a very
prized skill in Virginia.

00:11:46.308 --> 00:11:49.072
You probably remember or maybe
you might remember earlier in

00:11:49.072 --> 00:11:51.740
the course I talked about
William Maclay sitting next to a

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:54.455
Virginian at a dinner party and
saying that all they talked

00:11:54.455 --> 00:11:56.889
about was cockfighting and
horses and alcohol.

00:11:56.889 --> 00:11:58.360
Horses are in there in the top
three.

00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:02.639
So horse--being a good horseman
was very valued and Washington--

00:12:02.639 --> 00:12:04.577
some called him "the
finest horseman in the

00:12:04.577 --> 00:12:07.857
country"--
so he was impressive as--I

00:12:07.857 --> 00:12:09.927
think I--
Did I mention--I did mention

00:12:09.927 --> 00:12:12.470
last time at Mount Vernon when I
saw him on that horse and said,

00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:13.913
"My, he's impressive on
the horse,"

00:12:13.913 --> 00:12:15.783
and then basically repeated
what I'd read a thousand times

00:12:15.783 --> 00:12:16.798
in everyone else's letters.
 

00:12:16.798 --> 00:12:17.970
He really looked impressive on
the horse.

00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:20.308
He did. I can vouch.
 

00:12:20.308 --> 00:12:23.342
A somewhat less impressive but
expected one:

00:12:23.342 --> 00:12:25.528
Washington was a good dancer.
 

00:12:25.528 --> 00:12:27.936
Things you never knew about
George Washington:

00:12:27.936 --> 00:12:31.038
he was a good dancer,
which sounds seemingly trivial,

00:12:31.038 --> 00:12:34.090
but again as a gentleman
generally and as a Virginian

00:12:34.090 --> 00:12:36.788
specifically being a good dancer
is a way--

00:12:36.788 --> 00:12:40.090
another way of sort of publicly
displaying your superior

00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:40.750
breeding.
 

00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:43.745
Adams mentions grace,
dignity--all of these things

00:12:43.745 --> 00:12:47.351
that would make a gentleman
noticeable and someone who would

00:12:47.351 --> 00:12:48.820
seem to be superior.
 

00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:51.381
Dancing is one of them and
luckily he was a good dancer and

00:12:51.381 --> 00:12:53.678
he liked dancing--not the image
we have of George.

00:12:53.678 --> 00:12:56.865
Also like other gentlemen of
the time, Virginian and

00:12:56.865 --> 00:12:59.240
otherwise, Washington was
ambitious.

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:00.990
And this is going to come up
again.

00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:03.097
He doesn't necessarily always
look ambitious,

00:13:03.097 --> 00:13:04.200
but he was ambitious.
 

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:06.629
He did want to earn status and
reputation.

00:13:06.629 --> 00:13:08.990
He was ambitious to better
himself.

00:13:08.990 --> 00:13:12.258
During the French and Indian
War, he struggled to raise

00:13:12.258 --> 00:13:14.678
himself within the ranks of the
army,

00:13:14.678 --> 00:13:17.807
and for the entirety of his
life he was very focused on

00:13:17.807 --> 00:13:20.299
protecting and preserving his
reputation.

00:13:20.299 --> 00:13:21.778
He talks about it a lot.
 

00:13:21.778 --> 00:13:24.374
When he makes a big decision
about should I do this or should

00:13:24.374 --> 00:13:26.782
I not do this,
it's clearly--part of that

00:13:26.782 --> 00:13:29.870
decision is what will this do to
my reputation?

00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:32.528
And Alexander Hamilton,
who served in one way or

00:13:32.528 --> 00:13:35.190
another at Washington's side for
many years--

00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:38.423
first as an aide during the war
and then as Washington's first

00:13:38.423 --> 00:13:41.654
Secretary of the Treasury--
Hamilton is someone who really

00:13:41.654 --> 00:13:45.043
knew that if you wanted to get
Washington to do something you

00:13:45.043 --> 00:13:46.740
played the reputation card.
 

00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:47.114
Right?
 

00:13:47.114 --> 00:13:50.293
'Well, if you don't do this,
Sir, it may affect your

00:13:50.293 --> 00:13:51.230
reputation.'
 

00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:54.279
[laughter]
And so one way or another,

00:13:54.279 --> 00:13:56.546
if it might affect his
reputation, Washington's going

00:13:56.546 --> 00:13:59.595
to take it very seriously--
so he very much thought about

00:13:59.595 --> 00:14:02.918
what anything that he did would
do to his reputation.

00:14:02.918 --> 00:14:05.696
And what that actually means
is, when he does take these

00:14:05.696 --> 00:14:08.070
positions of great power and
responsibility,

00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:10.500
he's earning reputation,
he's also risking reputation,

00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:11.899
and I think he realizes both
things.

00:14:11.899 --> 00:14:14.259
I'll come back to that
momentarily.

00:14:14.259 --> 00:14:14.572
Okay.
 

00:14:14.572 --> 00:14:16.952
So a large landowner,
skilled horseman,

00:14:16.952 --> 00:14:19.456
good dancer,
ambitious, protective of his

00:14:19.456 --> 00:14:20.460
reputation.
 

00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:23.658
All of these things would have
been true of many gentlemen from

00:14:23.658 --> 00:14:24.950
throughout this period.
 

00:14:24.950 --> 00:14:27.740
And plus, of course --this is
obvious but worth stating

00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:30.528
because we forget it when we
talk about Washington--

00:14:30.528 --> 00:14:34.298
like any other gentleman of the
period Washington was human.

00:14:34.298 --> 00:14:34.546
Right?
 

00:14:34.546 --> 00:14:35.740
He could be self-interested.
 

00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:36.970
He could be gloomy.
 

00:14:36.970 --> 00:14:38.658
He could get excited.
 

00:14:38.658 --> 00:14:42.322
He was all of these things at
various points during the war

00:14:42.322 --> 00:14:43.080
and after.
 

00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:45.259
He sometimes doubted himself.
 

00:14:45.259 --> 00:14:46.298
He got bored.
 

00:14:46.298 --> 00:14:49.269
He got tired of all the pomp
and ceremony that basically

00:14:49.269 --> 00:14:52.509
surrounded him for the last
twenty-five years of his life.

00:14:52.509 --> 00:14:54.769
There's a story of him as
President;

00:14:54.769 --> 00:14:57.649
he really didn't like all the
pomp surrounding him as

00:14:57.649 --> 00:15:00.363
President, and there are several
stories actually,

00:15:00.363 --> 00:15:01.360
more than one.
 

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:04.590
He was seen giving a ceremonial
dinner as President,

00:15:04.590 --> 00:15:07.928
sitting at the head of the
table at this formal dinner,

00:15:07.928 --> 00:15:11.549
staring into space and sort of
banging a piece of silverware on

00:15:11.549 --> 00:15:14.842
the table,
[whistles]--so not wanting to

00:15:14.842 --> 00:15:19.298
be there and so uninterested in
what was going on.

00:15:19.298 --> 00:15:23.969
Again, he's all of these
things, including human as other

00:15:23.969 --> 00:15:25.720
gentlemen all were.
 

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:28.691
But there is something about
Washington that was different

00:15:28.691 --> 00:15:31.054
and in a sense,
there had to be something

00:15:31.054 --> 00:15:34.360
different to put him in the
exalted position of being quite

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:36.815
literally,
as one of his friends said at

00:15:36.815 --> 00:15:38.782
his death,
"first in war,

00:15:38.782 --> 00:15:41.298
first in peace,
and first in the hearts of his

00:15:41.298 --> 00:15:42.120
countrymen."
 

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:46.649
So how can we explain the
phenomenon of George Washington?

00:15:46.649 --> 00:15:49.465
And what I'm going to talk
about here in the answer

00:15:49.465 --> 00:15:51.830
basically is an answer with
three parts.

00:15:51.830 --> 00:15:54.687
The first part,
as we're about to see,

00:15:54.687 --> 00:15:57.700
has to do with Washington
personally.

00:15:57.700 --> 00:16:01.625
He's a man who was extremely
skilled at shaping his public

00:16:01.625 --> 00:16:05.827
image, at controlling himself
and presenting to the world what

00:16:05.827 --> 00:16:07.620
he wanted them to see.
 

00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:10.418
Related to that,
so part of that same thing,

00:16:10.418 --> 00:16:14.330
he was very skilled at sizing
up a situation and figuring out

00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:17.720
just what sort of statement or
action it required.

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:20.934
He was often a really brilliant
political strategist and a lot

00:16:20.934 --> 00:16:23.833
of people during his lifetime
and after praised his good

00:16:23.833 --> 00:16:24.519
judgment.
 

00:16:24.519 --> 00:16:27.519
He had--That's always the word
they used: He had good judgment.

00:16:27.519 --> 00:16:31.351
He was someone who could survey
the opinions of lots of people,

00:16:31.351 --> 00:16:33.639
ask all of his advisers for
advice.

00:16:33.639 --> 00:16:36.308
They often, more often than
not, had conflicting advice.

00:16:36.308 --> 00:16:37.850
He would take it under
advisement.

00:16:37.850 --> 00:16:39.558
He'd consider things for
himself.

00:16:39.558 --> 00:16:43.471
He'd come to a conclusion and
he'd act on it in a way that

00:16:43.471 --> 00:16:46.490
everyone always thought was
calm, considered,

00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:47.519
thoughtful.
 

00:16:47.519 --> 00:16:50.340
He was someone who had good
judgment and didn't act

00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:51.129
impulsively.
 

00:16:51.129 --> 00:16:55.200
So one reason for the
phenomenon of Washington,

00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:57.820
as I'll talk about in a moment
here,

00:16:57.820 --> 00:17:00.710
has to do with his
self-presentation and concrete

00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:03.298
skills in presenting himself as
a leader.

00:17:03.298 --> 00:17:06.772
The second way in which he
earned his reputation has to do

00:17:06.772 --> 00:17:10.551
really with the simple fact that
he's the right person with the

00:17:10.551 --> 00:17:13.243
right talents,
at the right place,

00:17:13.243 --> 00:17:14.778
at the right time.
 

00:17:14.778 --> 00:17:17.140
People often,
when they look at this time

00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:19.496
period,
in one way or another they ask

00:17:19.496 --> 00:17:22.424
the question,
'Well, why in this period were

00:17:22.424 --> 00:17:24.130
there so many great men?
 

00:17:24.130 --> 00:17:26.303
What was it about this period
that you have Washington,

00:17:26.303 --> 00:17:27.430
Jefferson, Adams,
Madison?

00:17:27.430 --> 00:17:29.058
Why all then?'
 

00:17:29.058 --> 00:17:32.462
And I think part of the answer
has to do with the right people

00:17:32.462 --> 00:17:34.640
in the right place at the right
time.

00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:36.740
I've talked earlier in the
course about how,

00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:38.826
as young men,
this is a generation of people

00:17:38.826 --> 00:17:41.638
who were trained by reading
things like Plutarch's Lives

00:17:41.638 --> 00:17:44.355
to think that one of the
sort of noblest and grandest

00:17:44.355 --> 00:17:47.509
things you could ever do is to
be the founder of a nation,

00:17:47.509 --> 00:17:48.500
to be a great statesman.
 

00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:51.698
So you have a generation of
young men who are trained to

00:17:51.698 --> 00:17:54.469
think that that's true,
and then that generation

00:17:54.469 --> 00:17:57.460
happens to be there when there's
a nation being founded.

00:17:57.460 --> 00:17:59.556
That's sort of a great--For
them, it's great,

00:17:59.556 --> 00:18:00.509
and they see that.
 

00:18:00.509 --> 00:18:02.413
They understand:
'oh, my gosh,

00:18:02.413 --> 00:18:05.960
this is the greatest thing I
can do and I can do it.

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:07.118
Who knew?'
 

00:18:07.118 --> 00:18:10.598
So you have these people who
had somewhat limited horizons.

00:18:10.598 --> 00:18:14.193
Maybe they were going to be a
lawyer or they would serve in

00:18:14.193 --> 00:18:16.548
public service in their own
colony,

00:18:16.548 --> 00:18:19.376
and suddenly the horizon opens
and they're able to be

00:18:19.376 --> 00:18:22.319
nation-founders,
and they know it and they rise

00:18:22.319 --> 00:18:25.695
to the occasion to promote
themselves and to do public

00:18:25.695 --> 00:18:27.163
good,
to do both things at the same

00:18:27.163 --> 00:18:28.943
time,
take advantage of the

00:18:28.943 --> 00:18:30.509
opportunity and act.
 

00:18:30.509 --> 00:18:33.410
And so it's partly why so many
great men--

00:18:33.410 --> 00:18:37.073
It's partly--You have people
who understand the significance

00:18:37.073 --> 00:18:40.923
of what's happening and act in
that capacity to do what they've

00:18:40.923 --> 00:18:43.470
been trained to think is good to
do,

00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:45.420
which is you do great acts of
service for your state,

00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:47.640
you become a great statesman
and you earn immortal fame.

00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:50.250
So you do great things for your
country and you get to be

00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:50.670
famous.
 

00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:53.346
They both happen sort of at the
same time, so it's sort of

00:18:53.346 --> 00:18:55.598
selfless and self-interested at
the same time.

00:18:55.598 --> 00:19:00.108
So Washington also,
like many people in this era,

00:19:00.108 --> 00:19:03.230
is the right person with the
right talents at the right time,

00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:06.250
but he has very specific
talents that are really well

00:19:06.250 --> 00:19:08.108
suited to this moment in time.
 

00:19:08.108 --> 00:19:10.440
And then finally,
the third reason for the

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:13.907
Washington phenomenon is kind of
a combination of the previous

00:19:13.907 --> 00:19:16.547
two,
and that's basically the idea

00:19:16.547 --> 00:19:20.288
that during the prime years of
Washington's life,

00:19:20.288 --> 00:19:24.276
Americans lost a king and
needed some other figure of

00:19:24.276 --> 00:19:29.259
central importance to fill this
vacuum of national leadership,

00:19:29.259 --> 00:19:32.179
some other leader who they
could honor as sort of the

00:19:32.179 --> 00:19:34.200
symbolic core of their new
nation.

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:36.950
And Washington,
because of who he was,

00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:39.150
because of who he presented
himself as being,

00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:42.348
because of what he did,
because of the ways in which he

00:19:42.348 --> 00:19:45.844
tried deliberately to conform
with prevailing feelings about

00:19:45.844 --> 00:19:49.338
leadership and about doing
things like leading armies,

00:19:49.338 --> 00:19:52.720
he really ends up being the
right man for that job.

00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:56.157
So for all of those reasons,
Washington ends up being the

00:19:56.157 --> 00:19:59.719
Father of His Country even
before the country is officially

00:19:59.719 --> 00:20:01.929
a country,
when it's still fighting its

00:20:01.929 --> 00:20:02.160
war.
 

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:04.828
So let's turn now to those
three reasons.

00:20:04.828 --> 00:20:06.250
Let's start with reason number
one,

00:20:06.250 --> 00:20:08.750
which is Washington and
self-presentation,

00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:12.422
and in a way this is
along--this is similar not only

00:20:12.422 --> 00:20:16.219
what Adams said,
but you'll hear Adams echoed in

00:20:16.219 --> 00:20:20.058
some of what I'm going to be
talking about here.

00:20:20.058 --> 00:20:23.372
Now, in a general way,
this is true that Washington

00:20:23.372 --> 00:20:25.890
presented himself well as a
leader,

00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:29.078
and in a general way--by that I
mean in a very specific way--

00:20:29.078 --> 00:20:32.420
he just looked and acted like a
Commander-in-Chief.

00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:35.630
He was a very tall and imposing
physical presence.

00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:39.338
He's a big man,
tall for the time,

00:20:39.338 --> 00:20:43.048
also just apparently big-boned.
 

00:20:43.048 --> 00:20:44.554
He's just a big,
imposing figure,

00:20:44.554 --> 00:20:47.047
very powerful looking,
who also managed to be graceful

00:20:47.047 --> 00:20:48.740
in his movements,
as Adams said.

00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:51.250
So he's someone who's strong,
big, powerful,

00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:53.992
and also seems in command of
himself physically,

00:20:53.992 --> 00:20:56.269
so he was just imposing to look
at.

00:20:56.269 --> 00:20:59.930
That's a natural gift,
but Washington had other much

00:20:59.930 --> 00:21:04.381
more deliberate self-conscious
aspects of his self-presentation

00:21:04.381 --> 00:21:07.538
as a leader that really served
him well.

00:21:07.538 --> 00:21:11.319
And as Adams sort of hints,
one of them is his

00:21:11.319 --> 00:21:14.176
self-control,
which was remarkable,

00:21:14.176 --> 00:21:18.964
and he really was controlling
his passions for most of the

00:21:18.964 --> 00:21:19.890
time.
 

00:21:19.890 --> 00:21:23.143
Now, I will say that any
gentleman of the period would

00:21:23.143 --> 00:21:26.827
have been expected to display
self-command or self-control as

00:21:26.827 --> 00:21:29.160
a sign of his superior
character,

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:32.170
and the ultimate example of
that of course is dueling.

00:21:32.170 --> 00:21:32.390
Right?
 

00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:34.375
Gentlemen are the ones
supposedly who duel in this time

00:21:34.375 --> 00:21:36.203
period,
and part of what you're doing

00:21:36.203 --> 00:21:39.298
when you duel is you're showing
that you're willing to risk your

00:21:39.298 --> 00:21:42.147
life to defend your honor by
standing on the field of honor

00:21:42.147 --> 00:21:44.900
against someone who is going to
be shooting at you.

00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:47.829
And you need to have complete
self-command and mastery of your

00:21:47.829 --> 00:21:49.751
passions and stand there
dispassionately,

00:21:49.751 --> 00:21:52.009
allowing this other person to
shoot at you.

00:21:52.009 --> 00:21:52.328
Right?
 

00:21:52.328 --> 00:21:55.577
That's the ultimate example of
what they would have considered

00:21:55.577 --> 00:21:59.038
in this period to be gentlemanly
self-command or self-control.

00:21:59.038 --> 00:22:02.018
For Washington self-command was
particularly important,

00:22:02.018 --> 00:22:04.996
because as Adams suggested,
he really did have a pretty

00:22:04.996 --> 00:22:06.210
impressive temper.
 

00:22:06.210 --> 00:22:08.640
He kept it under control most
of the time,

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:11.390
but he did lose his temper on a
number of occasions,

00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:15.102
and the reason why we know that
is people who were there and saw

00:22:15.102 --> 00:22:18.519
it were very impressed and they
usually wrote it down like:

00:22:18.519 --> 00:22:19.513
'ooh,
[laughs]

00:22:19.513 --> 00:22:20.930
guess what happened today?'
 

00:22:20.930 --> 00:22:24.039
So people tend to take note
because it was impressive,

00:22:24.039 --> 00:22:24.509
scary.
 

00:22:24.509 --> 00:22:27.878
He was a big guy and he would
just--when he lost his temper he

00:22:27.878 --> 00:22:29.259
really lost his temper.
 

00:22:29.259 --> 00:22:32.037
A great example of it--It
happens a number of times

00:22:32.037 --> 00:22:35.369
through the Revolution and I
actually went off looking to see

00:22:35.369 --> 00:22:37.868
if I could find a very specific
example--

00:22:37.868 --> 00:22:41.174
couldn't find one that I had
enough specific information on

00:22:41.174 --> 00:22:43.165
to offer,
so I'm going to offer this

00:22:43.165 --> 00:22:44.720
other one,
only because I have a quote

00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:46.980
associated with it,
and it's a story that always

00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:47.848
makes me happy.
 

00:22:47.848 --> 00:22:50.618
So even though it's from his
presidency, it's the same

00:22:50.618 --> 00:22:51.088
George.
 

00:22:51.088 --> 00:22:54.630
There's an instance of
Washington really,

00:22:54.630 --> 00:22:58.015
really just losing it during a
cabinet meeting in which one of

00:22:58.015 --> 00:23:01.233
his cabinet members came in with
a cartoon from a newspaper

00:23:01.233 --> 00:23:04.460
making fun of Washington,
and Washington just lost it.

00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:06.220
He just--He didn't like being
President.

00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:07.578
Everyone was making fun of him.
 

00:23:07.578 --> 00:23:10.605
He just lost control and
literally went into a screaming

00:23:10.605 --> 00:23:12.420
rant: 'I never wanted this job.
 

00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:15.300
I never wanted this job from
the moment I took this job and

00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:18.083
I've never wanted it at any
moment since'--just screaming

00:23:18.083 --> 00:23:18.680
ranting.
 

00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:21.203
We know this of course because
Thomas Jefferson took notes on

00:23:21.203 --> 00:23:21.710
it, right?
 

00:23:21.710 --> 00:23:23.433
[laughter]
like, 'you won't believe'--and

00:23:23.433 --> 00:23:26.064
it's his personal notes but he
took--he wrote down his version

00:23:26.064 --> 00:23:26.970
of what he heard.
 

00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:29.892
But my favorite part is
--apparently this was a really

00:23:29.892 --> 00:23:32.807
impressive rant,
and in Jefferson's notes he

00:23:32.807 --> 00:23:35.583
describes the rant,
and then at the end of the rant

00:23:35.583 --> 00:23:39.529
he writes in his notes,
'An awkward silence ensued'

00:23:39.529 --> 00:23:42.410
[laughter]
and then ends,

00:23:42.410 --> 00:23:45.470
'some difficulty resuming our
conversation.'

00:23:45.470 --> 00:23:47.637
[laughter]
And you could just hear--You

00:23:47.637 --> 00:23:50.721
could just--It just feels like
you're in the room like:

00:23:50.721 --> 00:23:52.890
'okay, [laughs]
now what do we do?

00:23:52.890 --> 00:23:53.789
Can we go home?
 

00:23:53.789 --> 00:23:55.789
[laughs] You're scary, George.
 

00:23:55.789 --> 00:23:56.348
You scared us.'
 

00:23:56.348 --> 00:23:56.750
Okay.
 

00:23:56.750 --> 00:24:01.557
So mastering your passion is
vital for anyone to be a trusted

00:24:01.557 --> 00:24:03.318
and admired leader.
 

00:24:03.318 --> 00:24:05.368
For Washington,
considering his temper,

00:24:05.368 --> 00:24:08.410
it's very important and he did
master his feelings,

00:24:08.410 --> 00:24:11.915
his temper, most of the time,
but he did more than just try

00:24:11.915 --> 00:24:13.608
not to display his temper.
 

00:24:13.608 --> 00:24:17.038
He actually tried to suppress
any sign of his feelings.

00:24:17.038 --> 00:24:19.558
He didn't want people to be
able to read him.

00:24:19.558 --> 00:24:22.135
He actually wanted to appear
sort of dispassionate,

00:24:22.135 --> 00:24:24.920
someone that you couldn't tell
what he was thinking.

00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:28.068
And he apparently did that
reasonably well,

00:24:28.068 --> 00:24:30.880
but also, it's clear that he
did it really,

00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:33.546
really deliberately,
because there is an account of

00:24:33.546 --> 00:24:36.266
someone who went to visit him
towards the end of his

00:24:36.266 --> 00:24:39.200
presidency and supposedly
commented to Washington,

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:42.308
'My, Sir, you look eager to get
back to Mount Vernon,' and

00:24:42.308 --> 00:24:43.678
Washington replied,
No.

00:24:43.678 --> 00:24:46.990
"My countenance never yet
betrayed my feelings."

00:24:46.990 --> 00:24:47.259
Right?
 

00:24:47.259 --> 00:24:49.861
You don't know I'm looking
forward to getting back to Mount

00:24:49.861 --> 00:24:50.308
Vernon.
 

00:24:50.308 --> 00:24:52.450
You can't tell what I'm feeling
on my face.

00:24:52.450 --> 00:24:54.240
[laughter] 'Okay.
 

00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:55.390
Yes, Sir.'
 

00:24:55.390 --> 00:24:56.584
[laughs]
But clearly,

00:24:56.584 --> 00:24:59.930
he's trying to present a
version of himself probably--

00:24:59.930 --> 00:25:02.190
maybe successfully or not
successfully--

00:25:02.190 --> 00:25:04.318
but largely some of the time
successfully,

00:25:04.318 --> 00:25:06.529
as this sort of dispassionate,
in-command,

00:25:06.529 --> 00:25:08.470
in-control kind of a leader.
 

00:25:08.470 --> 00:25:12.328
He knew how to present and
preserve his dignity,

00:25:12.328 --> 00:25:15.900
and when you joined that with
his very imposing appearance,

00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:19.630
his self-command made him a
rather intimidating figure.

00:25:19.630 --> 00:25:22.553
He is someone who many,
many people felt intimidated

00:25:22.553 --> 00:25:22.838
by.
 

00:25:22.838 --> 00:25:26.515
A great story that I have to
tell--I can't resist a good

00:25:26.515 --> 00:25:27.048
story.
 

00:25:27.048 --> 00:25:29.151
Basically, as I'm writing these
lectures I'm like:

00:25:29.151 --> 00:25:31.808
oh, this means I can tell this
story, and then I write it right

00:25:31.808 --> 00:25:32.710
into the lecture.
 

00:25:32.710 --> 00:25:36.874
This is just a famous example
which--well, or a pseudo

00:25:36.874 --> 00:25:37.660
example.
 

00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:39.567
It may have happened,
it may not have happened,

00:25:39.567 --> 00:25:41.848
but it's a famous story,
which I'll tell anyway with the

00:25:41.848 --> 00:25:43.839
sort of proviso that maybe it
didn't happen.

00:25:43.839 --> 00:25:44.769
But maybe it did.
 

00:25:44.769 --> 00:25:47.130
And it's when he's first
President.

00:25:47.130 --> 00:25:49.928
This is a great example of how
everyone perceived him to be

00:25:49.928 --> 00:25:51.519
this imposing,
scary character.

00:25:51.519 --> 00:25:53.634
There is some kind of a
reception really early on when

00:25:53.634 --> 00:25:55.190
the government first gets under
way,

00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:58.279
and Washington's there and
Alexander Hamilton is there,

00:25:58.279 --> 00:26:01.186
and one of Hamilton's friends
named Gouverneur Morris is

00:26:01.186 --> 00:26:01.608
there.
 

00:26:01.608 --> 00:26:03.868
And Morris and Hamilton always
get each other into trouble

00:26:03.868 --> 00:26:06.247
because they have the same sense
of humor and they're kind of

00:26:06.247 --> 00:26:08.108
practical jokers and it's just a
bad thing;

00:26:08.108 --> 00:26:10.390
if the two of them are together
bad things happen.

00:26:10.390 --> 00:26:13.646
So this is a great occasion of
that in which Hamilton says to

00:26:13.646 --> 00:26:16.238
Morris,
'I'll bet you a dinner you

00:26:16.238 --> 00:26:20.808
don't dare go up to Washington
and slap him on the back and

00:26:20.808 --> 00:26:23.519
say,
'Damn good to see you, Sir.'

00:26:23.519 --> 00:26:24.328
[laughs]
[laughter]

00:26:24.328 --> 00:26:26.130
It was like:
you don't dare touch him.

00:26:26.130 --> 00:26:27.618
Right? 'You go touch him.
 

00:26:27.618 --> 00:26:29.180
I'll bet you a dinner you don't
dare.'

00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:29.503
Right?
 

00:26:29.503 --> 00:26:32.368
Ridiculous, but Morris
apparently takes up the bet,

00:26:32.368 --> 00:26:37.019
goes up to Washington,
pats him on the back,

00:26:37.019 --> 00:26:40.090
'damn good to see you,
General,' and later reports the

00:26:40.090 --> 00:26:43.509
look that he got from Washington
at imposing in this way.

00:26:43.509 --> 00:26:46.356
He said he just wanted the
floor to open up so he could

00:26:46.356 --> 00:26:48.226
just go through,
like "poof,"

00:26:48.226 --> 00:26:48.999
I'm gone,
[laughter]

00:26:48.999 --> 00:26:50.730
and he supposedly went back to
Hamilton and said,

00:26:50.730 --> 00:26:53.440
"Yeah, I won the bet,
not worth it" [laughter]--

00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:54.849
really not worth it.
 

00:26:54.849 --> 00:26:57.650
He is just this imposing figure.
 

00:26:57.650 --> 00:27:01.037
During the war,
on many occasions he actually

00:27:01.037 --> 00:27:05.502
really had to be an imposing
figure not just for reasons of

00:27:05.502 --> 00:27:09.551
concrete military success,
which--it's true he did,

00:27:09.551 --> 00:27:12.174
for that reason--
but also because he

00:27:12.174 --> 00:27:16.157
individually personified the
Revolutionary cause in many

00:27:16.157 --> 00:27:18.428
ways,
including to the British,

00:27:18.428 --> 00:27:21.859
not just to his own men but to
the British as well,

00:27:21.859 --> 00:27:23.808
to British military authorities.
 

00:27:23.808 --> 00:27:27.847
He had to be imposing enough to
command respect from people who

00:27:27.847 --> 00:27:31.560
were not necessarily prepared to
see him as the commanding

00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:33.318
general of a real army.
 

00:27:33.318 --> 00:27:36.500
And as an example of this,
one of the sort of war games

00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:40.036
that the British occasionally
deployed against Washington was

00:27:40.036 --> 00:27:43.630
to address things to him in
writing by a civilian title,

00:27:43.630 --> 00:27:46.941
to George Washington,
Esquire, rather than General

00:27:46.941 --> 00:27:49.423
George Washington,
right?--doing that really

00:27:49.423 --> 00:27:50.019
deliberately.
 

00:27:50.019 --> 00:27:51.548
'Yeah, okay,
we're going to be respectful,

00:27:51.548 --> 00:27:53.340
George Washington,
Esquire, but you're not really

00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:55.578
a general and it's not a real
army'--is the implication.

00:27:55.578 --> 00:27:58.428
So on one occasion,
British General Howe addresses

00:27:58.428 --> 00:28:00.811
a letter to Washington:
George Washington,

00:28:00.811 --> 00:28:01.509
Esquire.
 

00:28:01.509 --> 00:28:03.297
Washington sees this,
gets the letter,

00:28:03.297 --> 00:28:06.242
refuses to accept it and sends
it back: 'it's not addressed to

00:28:06.242 --> 00:28:06.630
me.'
 

00:28:06.630 --> 00:28:06.923
Okay.
 

00:28:06.923 --> 00:28:09.986
So then Howe readdresses it and
this time he says to:

00:28:09.986 --> 00:28:12.105
George Washington,
Esquire, etcetera,

00:28:12.105 --> 00:28:12.930
etcetera.
 

00:28:12.930 --> 00:28:13.270
Yeah.
 

00:28:13.270 --> 00:28:15.868
[laughter]
This gets sent along with an

00:28:15.868 --> 00:28:18.808
aide back to Washington and
Washington--

00:28:18.808 --> 00:28:21.210
the aide assures Washington
that, quote,

00:28:21.210 --> 00:28:23.952
"The etcetera, etcetera,
implied everything that ought

00:28:23.952 --> 00:28:24.940
to follow."
 

00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:25.224
Right?
 

00:28:25.224 --> 00:28:27.838
He may not have said General
Washington but the etcetera

00:28:27.838 --> 00:28:29.361
means he was thinking it
[laughs]

00:28:29.361 --> 00:28:30.740
so that's pretty feeble.
 

00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:33.180
Washington says,
"It's true that etcetera,

00:28:33.180 --> 00:28:36.853
etcetera implied everything and
they also implied anything"

00:28:36.853 --> 00:28:40.292
and he refuses to accept it
again: 'this is not addressed to

00:28:40.292 --> 00:28:40.759
me.'
 

00:28:40.759 --> 00:28:43.400
And he sends it back,
which takes some fortitude to

00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:46.411
be sort of standing there
handing back this piece of paper

00:28:46.411 --> 00:28:51.400
multiple times to this person--
this aide to General Howe.

00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:55.077
Supposedly, someone who was
there said that the aide had,

00:28:55.077 --> 00:28:58.295
quote, "a pleasing
confusion on him the whole

00:28:58.295 --> 00:28:59.279
time."
 

00:28:59.279 --> 00:28:59.573
Right?
 

00:28:59.573 --> 00:29:02.505
He just didn't know what to do,
because he just didn't expect

00:29:02.505 --> 00:29:05.339
to confront this figure who
would just stand there and say,

00:29:05.339 --> 00:29:05.779
'No.
 

00:29:05.779 --> 00:29:06.869
You don't respect me.
 

00:29:06.869 --> 00:29:07.970
I don't accept it.
 

00:29:07.970 --> 00:29:09.230
Now what are you going to do?'
 

00:29:09.230 --> 00:29:11.288
So it completely put him on the
defensive,

00:29:11.288 --> 00:29:13.688
this poor British aide,
and he had to sort of go back

00:29:13.688 --> 00:29:16.409
and sort of figure out what to
do so that they could address

00:29:16.409 --> 00:29:19.130
him in some way that he would
actually read the letter.

00:29:19.130 --> 00:29:22.342
He had to be someone who could
maintain his dignity and

00:29:22.342 --> 00:29:25.555
maintain his position,
not just to command an army,

00:29:25.555 --> 00:29:28.390
but also to command the respect
of the enemy.

00:29:28.390 --> 00:29:31.710
So clearly he's an imposing
figure and he had to be,

00:29:31.710 --> 00:29:34.538
but there's an important point
to make here,

00:29:34.538 --> 00:29:36.882
and that is,
Washington combined that

00:29:36.882 --> 00:29:40.786
imposing demeanor with something
that was equally if not more

00:29:40.786 --> 00:29:44.950
important for him to display as
a leader in the new nation,

00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:48.400
and as particularly a military
leader in the new nation,

00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:51.048
and that is that he had a
modest demeanor.

00:29:51.048 --> 00:29:53.548
He was imposing,
but he did not look like

00:29:53.548 --> 00:29:55.858
someone who was grasping for
power.

00:29:55.858 --> 00:29:58.730
He knew how to display himself
to his best advantage,

00:29:58.730 --> 00:30:01.269
but he wasn't all pomp and show
and display.

00:30:01.269 --> 00:30:02.390
He was the opposite.
 

00:30:02.390 --> 00:30:03.839
He was modest,
he was cool,

00:30:03.839 --> 00:30:06.983
he was reserved,
and this was really important

00:30:06.983 --> 00:30:11.440
in the new American nation for
some very good reasons which had

00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:13.740
to do with distrust of power.
 

00:30:13.740 --> 00:30:16.473
In many ways,
as we've seen in this course so

00:30:16.473 --> 00:30:18.990
far,
the events leading up to the

00:30:18.990 --> 00:30:22.857
Revolution had confirmed
Americans' worst fears about

00:30:22.857 --> 00:30:24.420
tyranny and power.
 

00:30:24.420 --> 00:30:26.796
To Americans,
first Parliament and then the

00:30:26.796 --> 00:30:30.247
King had become tyrannical and
had used their power to destroy

00:30:30.247 --> 00:30:32.509
the liberties of American
colonists.

00:30:32.509 --> 00:30:36.797
So now, enter George Washington
who is given command of the

00:30:36.797 --> 00:30:40.193
American army and,
as you've already seen and

00:30:40.193 --> 00:30:43.510
discussed in the course,
one of the most obvious and

00:30:43.510 --> 00:30:45.910
deadly tools of tyranny is a
standing army.

00:30:45.910 --> 00:30:49.490
And history has plenty examples
of what happens when the wrong

00:30:49.490 --> 00:30:52.616
man gets control of an army,
and of course the most famous

00:30:52.616 --> 00:30:54.058
example would be Julius Caesar.
 

00:30:54.058 --> 00:30:57.801
And in Caesar you have this
brilliant warrior whose army was

00:30:57.801 --> 00:31:00.528
loyal to him and not to the
Roman state,

00:31:00.528 --> 00:31:01.990
and eventually Caesar took his
army,

00:31:01.990 --> 00:31:03.507
marched on Rome,
seized power,

00:31:03.507 --> 00:31:06.595
basically destroyed the Roman
republic and installed himself

00:31:06.595 --> 00:31:07.380
as emperor.
 

00:31:07.380 --> 00:31:11.326
That's not ancient history to
Americans or to anyone in the

00:31:11.326 --> 00:31:11.940
period.
 

00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:12.559
That's a lesson.
 

00:31:12.559 --> 00:31:14.009
That's a warning.
 

00:31:14.009 --> 00:31:16.871
Look at what happens when
ambitious men get military

00:31:16.871 --> 00:31:17.319
power.
 

00:31:17.319 --> 00:31:18.809
You get dictatorship.
 

00:31:18.809 --> 00:31:19.990
You get tyranny.
 

00:31:19.990 --> 00:31:23.505
You get all of the things that
Americans certainly are afraid

00:31:23.505 --> 00:31:25.789
might happen--and things are in
flux;

00:31:25.789 --> 00:31:27.160
they might happen.
 

00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:32.400
So here we have Washington
taking command of an organized--

00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:34.038
or I suppose you could say
semi-organized--

00:31:34.038 --> 00:31:37.218
army, a frightening concept and
certainly a really tricky

00:31:37.218 --> 00:31:40.737
situation for the person taking
command of an army in that kind

00:31:40.737 --> 00:31:41.930
of an atmosphere.
 

00:31:41.930 --> 00:31:46.478
So creating a small "r'
republican army is a tricky

00:31:46.478 --> 00:31:47.140
thing.
 

00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:49.950
That kind of an
army--It--Certainly,

00:31:49.950 --> 00:31:52.183
it has to be disciplined,
but it can't seem like this

00:31:52.183 --> 00:31:54.016
polished,
professional fighting force

00:31:54.016 --> 00:31:56.161
because that moves off into the
territory of:

00:31:56.161 --> 00:31:56.990
wait a minute.
 

00:31:56.990 --> 00:31:58.400
Is this detached from the state?
 

00:31:58.400 --> 00:31:59.400
What is this?
 

00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:02.440
Is this some private Washington
army?

00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:06.785
It has to seem able to be sort
of submissive to the state and

00:32:06.785 --> 00:32:09.028
yet able to fight and defend.
 

00:32:09.028 --> 00:32:13.211
It has to be a really careful
balance between having power but

00:32:13.211 --> 00:32:16.411
not having too much power,
being able to do what it's

00:32:16.411 --> 00:32:19.161
supposed to do but not being
able seemingly to do it without

00:32:19.161 --> 00:32:20.839
any other authority of any
kind--

00:32:20.839 --> 00:32:22.568
and this is Washington's task.
 

00:32:22.568 --> 00:32:26.220
He has to create this really
difficult to define thing,

00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:28.309
a republican army,
and we've already seen how hard

00:32:28.309 --> 00:32:30.614
it would have been just
generally to create an army out

00:32:30.614 --> 00:32:32.916
of people from all of these
different colonies and then

00:32:32.916 --> 00:32:35.561
finally all of these different
states who don't necessarily see

00:32:35.561 --> 00:32:37.993
eye to eye and they hadn't
worked together before and they

00:32:37.993 --> 00:32:40.808
care more about their locality
than about anywhere else.

00:32:40.808 --> 00:32:43.538
So there are all these basic
logistical problems with the

00:32:43.538 --> 00:32:45.446
army,
and now add this one into the

00:32:45.446 --> 00:32:47.696
mix, right?--
which is an army is something

00:32:47.696 --> 00:32:49.663
people are very,
very nervous about,

00:32:49.663 --> 00:32:52.950
and now he's going to be the
guy who's taking command of it.

00:32:52.950 --> 00:32:57.425
Now Washington was really aware
of all of these prevailing fears

00:32:57.425 --> 00:33:00.338
about power-hungry tyrants and
armies,

00:33:00.338 --> 00:33:03.636
so he did literally everything
that he could do to prove to

00:33:03.636 --> 00:33:06.991
Americans inside the Continental
Congress and outside of the

00:33:06.991 --> 00:33:10.119
Continental Congress that he was
not seeking power.

00:33:10.119 --> 00:33:12.400
Rather, he was accepting power.
 

00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:15.338
It was being given to him but
he was not seeking it.

00:33:15.338 --> 00:33:19.507
And here you can see his good
judgment as well as his skillful

00:33:19.507 --> 00:33:21.420
self-presentation in play.
 

00:33:21.420 --> 00:33:25.531
He's really sensitive to these
prevailing fears and he's really

00:33:25.531 --> 00:33:27.390
skilled at appeasing them.
 

00:33:27.390 --> 00:33:30.403
So for example listen to what
he says in his address to the

00:33:30.403 --> 00:33:33.625
Continental Congress after he's
nominated as Commander-in-Chief

00:33:33.625 --> 00:33:35.079
of the Continental Army.
 

00:33:35.079 --> 00:33:36.568
Okay. This is his address.
 

00:33:36.568 --> 00:33:38.269
He makes a very brief address,
a statement,

00:33:38.269 --> 00:33:40.941
to the Congress:
"Tho' I am truly sensible

00:33:40.941 --> 00:33:43.837
of the high Honour done me,
in this Appointment,

00:33:43.837 --> 00:33:46.624
yet I feel great distress,
from a consciousness that my

00:33:46.624 --> 00:33:49.046
abilities and military
experience may not be equal to

00:33:49.046 --> 00:33:50.769
the extensive and important
Trust.

00:33:50.769 --> 00:33:52.519
However, as the Congress desire
it,

00:33:52.519 --> 00:33:54.890
I will enter upon the momentous
duty,

00:33:54.890 --> 00:33:58.029
and exert every power I possess
in the service,

00:33:58.029 --> 00:34:00.009
and for support of the glorious
cause.

00:34:00.009 --> 00:34:02.839
I beg they will accept my most
cordial thanks for this

00:34:02.839 --> 00:34:05.348
distinguished testimony of their
approbation.

00:34:05.348 --> 00:34:07.750
But, lest some unlucky event
should happen,

00:34:07.750 --> 00:34:11.030
unfavourable to my reputation,
I beg it may be remembered,

00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:13.260
by every Gentleman in the room,
that I,

00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:15.349
this day, declare with the
utmost sincerity,

00:34:15.349 --> 00:34:18.436
I do not think myself equal to
the Command I am honored

00:34:18.436 --> 00:34:19.179
with."
 

00:34:19.179 --> 00:34:19.371
Okay.
 

00:34:19.371 --> 00:34:21.532
He's just been given the
command of the army and he says,

00:34:21.532 --> 00:34:22.420
'I'm going to do it.
 

00:34:22.420 --> 00:34:23.530
I'm going to try my hardest.
 

00:34:23.530 --> 00:34:26.139
I don't think I'm up to the
task.

00:34:26.139 --> 00:34:29.324
I don't think I'm good enough
for this but I'm going to try my

00:34:29.324 --> 00:34:29.900
hardest.'
 

00:34:29.900 --> 00:34:33.898
Now, given that I've already
described how he showed up to

00:34:33.898 --> 00:34:37.478
the Congress in a military
uniform basically saying,

00:34:37.478 --> 00:34:38.039
'Hi.
 

00:34:38.039 --> 00:34:40.300
I want this position,'
certainly he's not--he was not

00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:41.909
someone who was going to look
away.

00:34:41.909 --> 00:34:44.938
He wanted this position of
being Commander-in-Chief of the

00:34:44.938 --> 00:34:45.309
Army.
 

00:34:45.309 --> 00:34:48.500
And he then stands up and
announces,

00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:50.940
'I don't think I'm good enough
for this,' which might lead you

00:34:50.940 --> 00:34:52.619
to assume that it's an empty
platitude,

00:34:52.619 --> 00:34:53.500
but it really isn't.
 

00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:56.532
It's the absolute perfect thing
for someone in that position to

00:34:56.532 --> 00:34:58.929
say at that moment because it
reassured people;

00:34:58.929 --> 00:35:00.320
this is very explicitly what he
was doing.

00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:05.050
He's not an ambitious tyrant in
the making.

00:35:05.050 --> 00:35:07.367
And it did contain some truth,
because the fact of the matter

00:35:07.367 --> 00:35:09.530
is he wanted the position and he
was honestly fearful.

00:35:09.530 --> 00:35:12.581
You heard him say that if some
bad thing happens to my

00:35:12.581 --> 00:35:15.980
reputation--his reputation--He
does truly fear that maybe he

00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:17.420
isn't up to the task.
 

00:35:17.420 --> 00:35:20.041
This seems pretty enormous and
who knows what's going to

00:35:20.041 --> 00:35:20.469
happen?
 

00:35:20.469 --> 00:35:23.608
So he's also expressing a
sincere concern,

00:35:23.608 --> 00:35:24.909
a sincere fear.
 

00:35:24.909 --> 00:35:27.920
In that same statement to
Congress, he goes on to do

00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:30.931
brilliant thing number
two--again another example of

00:35:30.931 --> 00:35:32.230
his good judgment.
 

00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:35.842
He announces that he will serve
without pay as proof that he

00:35:35.842 --> 00:35:39.579
does not want to make any kind
of profit from his service,

00:35:39.579 --> 00:35:43.304
that he wants no financial
benefit for what he's doing for

00:35:43.304 --> 00:35:44.219
his country.
 

00:35:44.219 --> 00:35:45.579
Again, really brilliant thing
to do.

00:35:45.579 --> 00:35:49.155
Now of course he also says he's
going to keep an exact account

00:35:49.155 --> 00:35:50.210
of his expenses.
 

00:35:50.210 --> 00:35:50.516
Right?
 

00:35:50.516 --> 00:35:53.074
He doesn't want to get a
salary, but he will charge

00:35:53.074 --> 00:35:56.115
Congress for his expenses--
and there is an amusing book

00:35:56.115 --> 00:35:59.237
titled George Washington's
Expense Account by Marvin

00:35:59.237 --> 00:36:02.306
Kitman that looks at what
Washington was actually charging

00:36:02.306 --> 00:36:03.489
the Congress for.
 

00:36:03.489 --> 00:36:07.460
So it's not as though he was
spending a lot out of pocket.

00:36:07.460 --> 00:36:11.079
He did keep a careful account
of all of his expenses as

00:36:11.079 --> 00:36:14.030
Commander-in-Chief,
but again that's a pretty

00:36:14.030 --> 00:36:16.309
significant statement to make.
 

00:36:16.309 --> 00:36:19.739
People noticed it at the time
and commented on it and saw it,

00:36:19.739 --> 00:36:21.590
the symbolism in it and the
meaning of it,

00:36:21.590 --> 00:36:25.036
and commented just in the way
that he would have hoped people

00:36:25.036 --> 00:36:26.070
would have done.
 

00:36:26.070 --> 00:36:28.172
He really wanted to make a
certain impact,

00:36:28.172 --> 00:36:28.840
and he did.
 

00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:31.105
So for example,
here is John Adams at the

00:36:31.105 --> 00:36:34.559
time--not afterwards with his
ten talents, but at the time.

00:36:34.559 --> 00:36:36.451
He says,
"There is something

00:36:36.451 --> 00:36:38.460
charming to me in the conduct of
Washington.

00:36:38.460 --> 00:36:41.880
A gentleman of one of the first
fortunes upon the continent,

00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:44.342
leaving his delicious
retirement, his family and

00:36:44.342 --> 00:36:45.945
friends,
sacrificing his ease,

00:36:45.945 --> 00:36:48.239
and hazarding all in the cause
of his country!

00:36:48.239 --> 00:36:50.329
His views are noble and
disinterested.

00:36:50.329 --> 00:36:52.197
He declared,
when he accepted the mighty

00:36:52.197 --> 00:36:53.989
trust,
that he would lay before us an

00:36:53.989 --> 00:36:57.201
exact account of his expenses,
and not accept a shilling for

00:36:57.201 --> 00:36:57.869
pay."
 

00:36:57.869 --> 00:37:00.952
Or, as another Congressman put
it, "Let our Youth look up

00:37:00.952 --> 00:37:03.429
to this man as a pattern to form
themselves by;

00:37:03.429 --> 00:37:06.507
who unites the bravery of the
soldier with the most consummate

00:37:06.507 --> 00:37:07.869
modesty and virtue."
 

00:37:07.869 --> 00:37:08.083
Okay.
 

00:37:08.083 --> 00:37:10.320
That's exactly the point that
he's trying to make,

00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:12.710
right?--that I'm going to take
this large command,

00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:15.440
that I'm not looking personally
to profit by it,

00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:18.681
and there we have witnesses
that are exactly getting that

00:37:18.681 --> 00:37:19.260
message.
 

00:37:19.260 --> 00:37:22.670
Shortly thereafter he made yet
another symbolic gesture,

00:37:22.670 --> 00:37:26.391
another example of the way in
which he's so good at appeasing

00:37:26.391 --> 00:37:27.570
people's fears.
 

00:37:27.570 --> 00:37:30.880
He gets a letter from the New
York Provincial Congress with a

00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:34.135
little nervous passage in it
reminding him that when the war

00:37:34.135 --> 00:37:37.612
ends he's expected to resign his
position and return to civilian

00:37:37.612 --> 00:37:38.219
life.
 

00:37:38.219 --> 00:37:38.445
Okay.
 

00:37:38.445 --> 00:37:40.797
This is a little nervous letter
from New York saying,

00:37:40.797 --> 00:37:43.239
'Please don't be a military
dictator after the war.

00:37:43.239 --> 00:37:45.659
Sincerely, the New York
Provincial Congress.'

00:37:45.659 --> 00:37:48.572
I don't know what they thought
they would accomplish with that

00:37:48.572 --> 00:37:50.099
letter, but it's a valid fear.
 

00:37:50.099 --> 00:37:52.221
It's one that many people
had--and again,

00:37:52.221 --> 00:37:54.820
Washington responds with a sort
of model reply.

00:37:54.820 --> 00:37:57.291
He says, "When we assumed
the Soldier, we did not lay

00:37:57.291 --> 00:37:59.440
aside the Citizen;
and we shall most sincerely

00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:02.288
rejoice with you in that happy
hour when the establishment of

00:38:02.288 --> 00:38:03.380
American Liberty ...
 

00:38:03.380 --> 00:38:05.987
shall enable us to return to
our Private Stations in the

00:38:05.987 --> 00:38:07.646
bosom of a free,
peaceful, and happy

00:38:07.646 --> 00:38:08.500
Country."
 

00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:11.034
This is exactly what people
would have wanted a military

00:38:11.034 --> 00:38:13.014
leader to say:
'I look forward to the end of

00:38:13.014 --> 00:38:15.550
the war where I and everyone
else can all go home,

00:38:15.550 --> 00:38:18.219
end of army, end of power.'
 

00:38:18.219 --> 00:38:21.454
And that letter and the New
York letter that called it forth

00:38:21.454 --> 00:38:24.469
are both published in newspapers
around the colonies.

00:38:24.469 --> 00:38:28.420
In both of these actions,
Washington is styling himself

00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:31.788
after the sort of republican
ideal of a leader,

00:38:31.788 --> 00:38:32.519
right?
 

00:38:32.519 --> 00:38:34.320
Someone who's public minded;
he's self-sacrificing;

00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:37.059
he's virtuous;
he's devoted to his country.

00:38:37.059 --> 00:38:42.077
There is a play at the time by
British writer Joseph Addison

00:38:42.077 --> 00:38:45.233
titled Cato,
which is based on the life

00:38:45.233 --> 00:38:48.588
of Cato the Younger who defended
Rome and Roman virtues against

00:38:48.588 --> 00:38:51.271
the tyrant Caesar,
and that was highly popular in

00:38:51.271 --> 00:38:53.460
America at this time and not
surprisingly,

00:38:53.460 --> 00:38:54.989
it's Washington's favorite play.
 

00:38:54.989 --> 00:38:56.880
Washington has it performed for
the troops.

00:38:56.880 --> 00:39:00.112
It's reprinted again and again
and again in revolutionary

00:39:00.112 --> 00:39:00.690
America.
 

00:39:00.690 --> 00:39:02.739
And Nathan Hale's famous last
words,

00:39:02.739 --> 00:39:05.242
"I regret that I have but
one life to lose for my

00:39:05.242 --> 00:39:07.320
country,"
are adapted from that play.

00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:10.632
That's the sort of ideal that
Washington's trying to live up

00:39:10.632 --> 00:39:12.853
to,
and any wise man assuming a

00:39:12.853 --> 00:39:15.619
position of leadership--
and particularly military

00:39:15.619 --> 00:39:17.570
leadership--
would have done the same thing.

00:39:17.570 --> 00:39:21.860
Modesty, self-sacrifice,
not lusting for power.

00:39:21.860 --> 00:39:25.701
The best way to be trusted and
beloved as a leader was to

00:39:25.701 --> 00:39:28.719
modestly surrender power again
and again,

00:39:28.719 --> 00:39:31.829
and people would then be sure
to come back and offer you more.

00:39:31.829 --> 00:39:35.081
Now it's worth mentioning at
this point that maybe the most

00:39:35.081 --> 00:39:38.279
famous thing that Washington
ever did is right along these

00:39:38.279 --> 00:39:38.840
lines.
 

00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:41.619
The most famous thing that he
did at the time,

00:39:41.619 --> 00:39:43.409
is at the close of the war.
 

00:39:43.409 --> 00:39:44.159
The war is over.
 

00:39:44.159 --> 00:39:44.768
He has won.
 

00:39:44.768 --> 00:39:48.710
He has an army at his command
and what does he do?

00:39:48.710 --> 00:39:52.099
He resigns his commission and
goes home, period.

00:39:52.099 --> 00:39:55.280
That was literally
world-shaking in its impact.

00:39:55.280 --> 00:39:58.056
It is not what people thought
would happen at the end of the

00:39:58.056 --> 00:39:58.340
war.
 

00:39:58.340 --> 00:40:00.750
You have a victorious general
and an army.

00:40:00.750 --> 00:40:03.911
People assume,
what happens now is that that

00:40:03.911 --> 00:40:06.340
victorious general takes power.
 

00:40:06.340 --> 00:40:09.438
Washington literally just said,
'Thank you very much' and went

00:40:09.438 --> 00:40:11.320
back to Mount Vernon,
end of story.

00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:13.489
It was noticed the world over.
 

00:40:13.489 --> 00:40:15.659
It was--had such an impact.
 

00:40:15.659 --> 00:40:19.516
It literally ensured that
Washington would be the one man

00:40:19.516 --> 00:40:22.340
most trusted with power forever
after,

00:40:22.340 --> 00:40:25.960
because he had given that
supreme example of giving it up.

00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:29.500
He had said at the moment where
everyone expected him to keep

00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:30.090
it, 'No.
 

00:40:30.090 --> 00:40:31.480
I'm giving it right back.'
 

00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:34.215
That's why he ends up being the
one guy who could have been

00:40:34.215 --> 00:40:35.920
President--
because he proved in--to

00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:38.304
Americans at the time,
in the ultimate way possible,

00:40:38.304 --> 00:40:39.599
he was not hungry for power.
 

00:40:39.599 --> 00:40:43.621
Supposedly, at the time--When
King George heard that this was

00:40:43.621 --> 00:40:46.610
what was going to happen--
that Washington was just going

00:40:46.610 --> 00:40:48.646
to resign and go home--
supposedly his response was

00:40:48.646 --> 00:40:51.409
that if Washington did do that,
quote, "he will be the

00:40:51.409 --> 00:40:53.070
greatest man in the world."
 

00:40:53.070 --> 00:40:56.411
That's the King saying:
the impact of that will be

00:40:56.411 --> 00:40:59.550
enormous, if he's actually going
to do that.

00:40:59.550 --> 00:41:02.163
The King doesn't even really
believe he will,

00:41:02.163 --> 00:41:05.550
but if he actually does that,
that's an incredible act.

00:41:05.550 --> 00:41:08.610
He will be the greatest man in
the world.

00:41:08.610 --> 00:41:11.090
So one historian has said
basically, "George

00:41:11.090 --> 00:41:13.780
Washington was the virtuoso of
resignations."

00:41:13.780 --> 00:41:16.072
[laughs]
He perfected the art of getting

00:41:16.072 --> 00:41:17.599
power by giving it away.
 

00:41:17.599 --> 00:41:18.719
In a sense that's true.
 

00:41:18.719 --> 00:41:20.510
It's not that he's being
devious.

00:41:20.510 --> 00:41:23.251
It's not that he's sort of
pretending to be modest because

00:41:23.251 --> 00:41:24.070
he wants power.
 

00:41:24.070 --> 00:41:26.880
It's that he understands
people's fears.

00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:30.025
It's that he's serving in
positions that he wants to

00:41:30.025 --> 00:41:32.132
serve,
but he then also understands

00:41:32.132 --> 00:41:35.405
that his job after serving in
them is to step away and allow

00:41:35.405 --> 00:41:38.179
future responsibility to be
given to him again.

00:41:38.179 --> 00:41:41.931
He maintains a sort of ideal
balance between ambition and

00:41:41.931 --> 00:41:44.532
modesty--
and it's this ideal and sort of

00:41:44.532 --> 00:41:48.077
really necessary balance in
America at the time where people

00:41:48.077 --> 00:41:51.119
were so scared of power,
standing armies,

00:41:51.119 --> 00:41:54.090
monarchs, tyrants,
dictators, all of these things

00:41:54.090 --> 00:41:54.809
sort of looming.
 

00:41:54.809 --> 00:41:58.172
And Washington ends up in one
way or another proving again and

00:41:58.172 --> 00:42:00.489
again that he isn't any of those
things.

00:42:00.489 --> 00:42:04.079
And it's for all of these
reasons why, when King George

00:42:04.079 --> 00:42:06.340
III finally is let go of--right?
 

00:42:06.340 --> 00:42:08.684
I've talked in the past about
how Americans first are upset

00:42:08.684 --> 00:42:11.233
with Parliament and then finally
they're upset with the King and

00:42:11.233 --> 00:42:13.659
it's a slow process of Americans
sort of divorcing themselves

00:42:13.659 --> 00:42:15.518
from their love and loyalty for
England.

00:42:15.518 --> 00:42:17.250
When they finally let go of the
King,

00:42:17.250 --> 00:42:19.260
it makes sense,
given everything that I've just

00:42:19.260 --> 00:42:21.628
said,
that Washington is the logical

00:42:21.628 --> 00:42:25.530
person who fills that vacuum of
the sort of symbolic leader

00:42:25.530 --> 00:42:28.018
who's going to represent
America,

00:42:28.018 --> 00:42:32.110
who's going to be the sort of
core symbolic leader of America.

00:42:32.110 --> 00:42:35.170
Very early on in the war,
people begin to substitute

00:42:35.170 --> 00:42:38.170
George Washington for King
George in ceremonies and

00:42:38.170 --> 00:42:38.889
rituals.
 

00:42:38.889 --> 00:42:42.123
As early as 1778,
Washington is called the Father

00:42:42.123 --> 00:42:43.268
of His Country.
 

00:42:43.268 --> 00:42:46.228
Washington's birthday,
and not the King's,

00:42:46.228 --> 00:42:48.610
is celebrated as early as 1779.
 

00:42:48.610 --> 00:42:51.456
So literally,
he's just being substituted

00:42:51.456 --> 00:42:52.239
right in.
 

00:42:52.239 --> 00:42:53.889
It's like, 'well,
we lost that symbolic figure.

00:42:53.889 --> 00:42:55.489
Here's a new George.
 

00:42:55.489 --> 00:42:57.570
We'll just put him right in.
 

00:42:57.570 --> 00:43:00.746
We have a new leader and he's
virtuous and he's not ambitious

00:43:00.746 --> 00:43:03.447
and he's a good republican
leader so we can actually

00:43:03.447 --> 00:43:06.782
celebrate him and we want him to
be a sort of symbolic center of

00:43:06.782 --> 00:43:08.159
the American cause.'
 

00:43:08.159 --> 00:43:08.505
Okay.
 

00:43:08.505 --> 00:43:11.269
So I have two minutes to
complete here.

00:43:11.269 --> 00:43:12.300
What have we seen today?
 

00:43:12.300 --> 00:43:15.369
We've certainly seen how
Washington looked and acted the

00:43:15.369 --> 00:43:17.489
part of the ideal republican
leader.

00:43:17.489 --> 00:43:20.583
We've seen how and why this was
so important to Americans in

00:43:20.583 --> 00:43:22.840
revolutionary and early national
America.

00:43:22.840 --> 00:43:25.650
They had really good reasons to
be scared,

00:43:25.650 --> 00:43:28.090
suspicious about power and who
had it--

00:43:28.090 --> 00:43:32.492
and Washington proved again and
again he was the ideal person to

00:43:32.492 --> 00:43:33.820
trust with power.
 

00:43:33.820 --> 00:43:35.449
He understood prevailing fears.
 

00:43:35.449 --> 00:43:39.409
He addressed himself to calming
those fears in sincere ways in

00:43:39.409 --> 00:43:41.362
his manner,
in his actions,

00:43:41.362 --> 00:43:45.619
in his self-presentation,
yet also managing to remain an

00:43:45.619 --> 00:43:47.840
imposing leader throughout.
 

00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:51.090
It was a really difficult
balance, I think,

00:43:51.090 --> 00:43:54.266
for anyone to maintain and in
many ways it's why he really is

00:43:54.266 --> 00:43:57.445
the right man with the right
skills in the right place at the

00:43:57.445 --> 00:43:58.239
right time.
 

00:43:58.239 --> 00:44:00.748
He's the guy who manages to
maintain that difficult

00:44:00.748 --> 00:44:02.320
balance--
to command an army,

00:44:02.320 --> 00:44:05.010
to sort of be a symbolic center
of a new nation,

00:44:05.010 --> 00:44:08.692
to allow for the fact that he's
ambitious but to not seem too

00:44:08.692 --> 00:44:10.960
ambitious,
to not seem desirous of power.

00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:13.652
It's a really,
really tricky thing to carry

00:44:13.652 --> 00:44:17.690
off and Washington actually did,
which is kind of remarkable.

00:44:17.690 --> 00:44:19.478
And, granted,
there are moments probably when

00:44:19.478 --> 00:44:22.382
he did it better than others,
but in the end it's his ability

00:44:22.382 --> 00:44:25.693
to maintain that kind of balance
that made him the perfect figure

00:44:25.693 --> 00:44:28.900
for that moment in time and for
serving the role that he served

00:44:28.900 --> 00:44:30.090
in the Revolution.
 

00:44:30.090 --> 00:44:32.079
Okay. On that I will conclude.
 

00:44:32.079 --> 00:44:33.657
We will move on,
on Thursday,

00:44:33.657 --> 00:44:36.699
to watching Washington in
action as we begin to look at

00:44:36.699 --> 00:44:39.630
how the war is unfolding on the
field of battle.

00:44:39.630 --> 00:44:45.000

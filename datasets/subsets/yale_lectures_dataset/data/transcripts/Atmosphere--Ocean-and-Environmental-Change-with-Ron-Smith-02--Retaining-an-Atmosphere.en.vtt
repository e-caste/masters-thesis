00:00:01.167 --> 00:00:05.600
RONALD SMITH: We were
talking last time about--

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.033
well, we asked questions like,
how do we know there's an

00:00:08.033 --> 00:00:08.667
atmosphere?

00:00:08.667 --> 00:00:11.200
I wanted to follow that
up a little bit more.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.467
Someone had mentioned
atmospheric pressure as being

00:00:13.467 --> 00:00:16.500
something that's really
important for knowing there's

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.267
an atmosphere.

00:00:17.267 --> 00:00:19.967
And I said, well, we don't
really sense it very well,

00:00:19.967 --> 00:00:21.100
because our bodies tend to

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.167
equilibrate inside and outside.

00:00:23.167 --> 00:00:26.233
When we go up in an elevator,
we're moving into lower

00:00:26.233 --> 00:00:29.867
pressure, but we may feel it in
the ears but we don't feel

00:00:29.867 --> 00:00:32.200
it most other places
on our bodies.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.033
But then I was thinking, there
are some other ways that we

00:00:35.033 --> 00:00:37.167
could sense pressure.

00:00:37.167 --> 00:00:41.400
And I had these suction
cups in my office.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.533
They're not sticky in any way,
but when you push them

00:00:45.533 --> 00:00:51.300
together and remove the air
that's inside, then you only

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.633
have the atmospheric pressure
acting on the outside and

00:00:54.633 --> 00:00:55.733
nothing on the inside.

00:00:55.733 --> 00:01:00.133
So when you try to
pull them apart--

00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:00.667
try that.

00:01:00.667 --> 00:01:02.033
Watch out for your
elbows there.

00:01:05.533 --> 00:01:07.567
Everybody gets to
try that today.

00:01:07.567 --> 00:01:11.067
So you'll see, that's
atmospheric pressure, right?

00:01:11.067 --> 00:01:14.433
Again, watch the elbows so you
don't get the guy next to you.

00:01:14.433 --> 00:01:18.567
Now, you were walking up to
class today, and you remember

00:01:18.567 --> 00:01:19.833
that we got --

00:01:24.333 --> 00:01:26.600
one of the pieces of advice
that I gave you for this

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.033
course is to develop a habit
of looking up in the sky.

00:01:30.033 --> 00:01:31.467
And what did you see
this morning when

00:01:31.467 --> 00:01:33.933
you walked to class?

00:01:33.933 --> 00:01:34.867
Blue sky.

00:01:34.867 --> 00:01:37.067
Now, what if there had
been no atmosphere?

00:01:37.067 --> 00:01:40.000
What would you see when
you looked up?

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.467
Black, right.

00:01:41.467 --> 00:01:45.600
So that blue sky is light that's
been scattered to your

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.367
eye by the molecules
in the atmosphere.

00:01:49.367 --> 00:01:52.367
So that's a good way to know
there's an atmosphere.

00:01:52.367 --> 00:01:55.200
Oh, another one on
the pressure.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.067
When you're having lunch, if
you're drinking from a straw--

00:02:00.067 --> 00:02:01.133
I don't know if you do that.

00:02:01.133 --> 00:02:04.367
But when you're drinking from a
straw, you may think you're

00:02:04.367 --> 00:02:07.833
sucking that fluid
into your mouth.

00:02:07.833 --> 00:02:08.700
Actually you're not.

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.267
You're dropping the pressure
a little bit, but it's the

00:02:11.267 --> 00:02:15.267
atmospheric pressure pushing
down on the top of the fluid

00:02:15.267 --> 00:02:17.333
that's actually what's pushing
it up the straw.

00:02:17.333 --> 00:02:20.500
So you're not doing much.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.167
The atmosphere is doing
most of that with

00:02:22.167 --> 00:02:23.467
its atmospheric pressure.

00:02:23.467 --> 00:02:29.033
So we'll continue to think about
these day-to-day ways in

00:02:29.033 --> 00:02:33.033
which we will know that
there's an atmosphere.

00:02:33.033 --> 00:02:36.667
Are there any questions on these
issues before we begin?

00:02:36.667 --> 00:02:38.233
Any of the things we spoke
about last time?

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:42.100
Nothing?

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.567
OK.

00:02:42.567 --> 00:02:46.967
Well, then, I want to move on
to a subject today which is

00:02:46.967 --> 00:02:52.300
related to what we
had last time.

00:02:52.300 --> 00:03:08.900
And that is which planets have
atmospheres and why?

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:19.133
And it turns out that the key
physics, the key process that

00:03:19.133 --> 00:03:22.867
determines this is whether
molecules at the top of the

00:03:22.867 --> 00:03:27.633
atmosphere can escape the
planet's gravitational field.

00:03:27.633 --> 00:03:29.200
Now, let me be clear on this.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.733
The molecules in this room are
traveling a very short

00:03:32.733 --> 00:03:35.700
distance and then they encounter
another molecule and

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.800
they collide, and then
another short

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:38.867
distance and they collide.

00:03:38.867 --> 00:03:41.700
So there's no chance that these
molecules in the lower

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.633
part of the atmosphere could
ever escape, at least not

00:03:44.633 --> 00:03:48.167
immediately, because they're
surrounded by other molecules.

00:03:48.167 --> 00:03:51.233
But the molecules at the top of
the atmosphere, if they're

00:03:51.233 --> 00:03:52.200
heading upwards--

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.367
and some of them are--

00:03:54.367 --> 00:03:58.000
they might just leave. They may
just get fed up and decide

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.867
to leave the Earth's
atmosphere.

00:03:59.867 --> 00:04:04.200
So we have to come up with some
way of understanding that

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.167
process, and to find out
when it works and

00:04:07.167 --> 00:04:07.833
when it doesn't work.

00:04:07.833 --> 00:04:11.567
So to do that, we need to define
something called the

00:04:11.567 --> 00:04:12.800
escape velocity.

00:04:17.967 --> 00:04:30.400
It's defined as the velocity
needed to escape from the

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.200
gravitational field
of a planet.

00:04:43.067 --> 00:04:45.767
Now, if this was a course in
physics, we would derive it.

00:04:45.767 --> 00:04:49.567
It's not a difficult derivation
as it turns out.

00:04:49.567 --> 00:04:51.767
But I'm just going to give
you the formula for it.

00:04:51.767 --> 00:04:57.400
V escape is given by the square
root of twice times

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:02.800
little g times big R. Little
g is the surface

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.133
gravity of the planet.

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:14.400
For Earth, by the way, I think
you know what that number is.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.700
g is 9.81 meters per
second squared.

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:20.867
It's given in units
of acceleration.

00:05:20.867 --> 00:05:22.167
In fact, it's just the rate--

00:05:22.167 --> 00:05:24.233
if you drop something, it's
the rate at which it

00:05:24.233 --> 00:05:28.300
accelerates towards the
surface of the Earth.

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:32.333
And big R in this formula is
the radius of the planet.

00:05:39.433 --> 00:05:40.733
Now, to be consistent--

00:05:40.733 --> 00:05:49.600
oh, by the way, for Earth
this is about 6,371.

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:54.000
The Earth is not exactly
spherical so this number is a

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.767
little different depending
where you are.

00:05:58.367 --> 00:06:01.767
It's about 6,400 kilometers,
the radius of the earth.

00:06:01.767 --> 00:06:06.267
So let's work out an
example of this and

00:06:06.267 --> 00:06:07.833
then see what it means.

00:06:07.833 --> 00:06:11.167
So for Earth, then, V escape--

00:06:11.167 --> 00:06:14.133
let's compute it first. It's
going to be the square root of

00:06:14.133 --> 00:06:21.467
2 times 9.81 times the
radius of the earth.

00:06:21.467 --> 00:06:25.900
We have to work in consistent SI
units, international system

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:27.533
or so-called metric units.

00:06:27.533 --> 00:06:29.633
So I need to convert
that to meters.

00:06:29.633 --> 00:06:34.333
So that's going to be 6,370 and
then three more zeros to

00:06:34.333 --> 00:06:37.067
get it into meters.

00:06:37.067 --> 00:06:41.200
And you know how to do
a square root on your

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:42.000
calculator.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:48.300
That comes out to be 11,180
meters per second.

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:51.933
That's the escape velocity
for planet Earth.

00:06:51.933 --> 00:06:53.967
Now, it's going to be different
for other planets,

00:06:53.967 --> 00:06:56.500
because they're going to have
different surface gravities

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:58.533
and different radii.

00:06:58.533 --> 00:07:00.433
But that's the escape velocity
for planet Earth.

00:07:00.433 --> 00:07:01.467
So what does that mean?

00:07:01.467 --> 00:07:04.233
If I'm at the top of
the atmosphere,

00:07:04.233 --> 00:07:06.267
there is the Earth.

00:07:06.267 --> 00:07:08.033
There's the atmosphere.

00:07:08.033 --> 00:07:10.467
And if I've got a molecule at
the top that happens to be

00:07:10.467 --> 00:07:16.600
heading upwards, if it has
a velocity less than this

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:20.867
number, it's going to go up for
a while and then stop and

00:07:20.867 --> 00:07:26.700
then gravity's going to bring
it back into the atmosphere.

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:32.100
If I have a molecule that's
moving faster than that speed,

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:36.800
it's going to leave. It will
never be seen again in the

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:39.533
vicinity of planet Earth.

00:07:39.533 --> 00:07:44.000
So this here is when the upward
velocity is greater

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.767
than V escape, and this is when
v is less than V escape.

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:53.733
Something interesting
about this formula--

00:07:53.733 --> 00:07:57.133
notice that the mass of the
object that we're talking

00:07:57.133 --> 00:08:00.633
about does not enter
into that formula.

00:08:00.633 --> 00:08:05.233
So this would apply for a
molecule or for a rocket ship.

00:08:05.233 --> 00:08:10.000
When they launch a rocket into
orbit or to another planet,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.900
it's exactly that same speed.

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:16.200
But they have to accelerate the
rocket in order to get it

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:19.467
to escape from our planet's
gravitational field.

00:08:19.467 --> 00:08:23.067
So this is kind of a universal
number for the planet,

00:08:23.067 --> 00:08:27.767
independent of what
the object is.

00:08:27.767 --> 00:08:29.033
Any questions on that?

00:08:31.533 --> 00:08:35.100
So that's pretty helpful, but
it's only half the story.

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:39.000
Because we have to know
something about what the

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.667
molecules will be doing.

00:08:42.667 --> 00:08:47.733
So the typical speed
of a molecule--

00:08:56.333 --> 00:09:00.400
I'm going to call
it v sub M-O-L--

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:07.433
is given by the square root of
3 R bar T over capital M. Now

00:09:07.433 --> 00:09:09.967
this is a formula you might
derive in a chemistry class,

00:09:09.967 --> 00:09:13.967
and maybe you've seen this
one before as well.

00:09:13.967 --> 00:09:19.933
In this formula, R hat is the
universal gas constant.

00:09:29.367 --> 00:09:36.433
T is the temperature
of the gas.

00:09:36.433 --> 00:09:39.233
It must be expressed
in kelvins to

00:09:39.233 --> 00:09:40.600
work in that formula.

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:43.567
That is in absolute units.

00:09:43.567 --> 00:09:46.700
And what else do
we have there?

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:51.100
M is the molecular weight of
the molecule in question.

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:02.167
Now, I think you know how to
go back and forth between

00:10:02.167 --> 00:10:02.900
temperature units.

00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:06.833
But let me just remind you-- if
you've got a temperature in

00:10:06.833 --> 00:10:15.900
degrees Celsius, you
have to add to that

00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:19.567
approximately 273.1--

00:10:19.567 --> 00:10:21.633
sorry, that's an add.

00:10:21.633 --> 00:10:25.533
Temperature in Celsius plus
273.1 will give you the

00:10:25.533 --> 00:10:27.700
temperature in kelvins.

00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:30.300
Kelvins is on the
absolute scale.

00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:32.400
Before we go any further, let
me just give you a little

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:35.967
table of these molecular weights
for some -- for a few

00:10:35.967 --> 00:10:40.233
of the gases that we might
be interested in.

00:10:40.233 --> 00:10:42.833
I'll make a table here.

00:10:42.833 --> 00:10:50.200
For a single hydrogen atom by
itself, it has just one proton

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:54.433
in its nucleus and no neutrons,
so its molecular

00:10:54.433 --> 00:10:55.867
weight is 1.

00:10:55.867 --> 00:10:57.467
This will be the column
of molecular

00:10:57.467 --> 00:11:00.233
weights, going down here.

00:11:00.233 --> 00:11:05.300
Hydrogen usually occurs in the
diatomic form, two atoms

00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:07.167
fastened together with a bond.

00:11:07.167 --> 00:11:10.633
And of course the molecular
weight for that would be 2.

00:11:10.633 --> 00:11:17.300
Helium has two protons and two
neutrons in its nucleus, so it

00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:18.800
has a molecular weight of 4.

00:11:21.667 --> 00:11:22.833
Nitrogen--

00:11:22.833 --> 00:11:26.567
and most of the gas in this
room is nitrogen--

00:11:26.567 --> 00:11:31.267
appears in the diatomic form,
two nitrogen atoms together.

00:11:31.267 --> 00:11:36.433
Each one has a mass of 14, so
the molecular weight of the N2

00:11:36.433 --> 00:11:40.033
molecule is 28.

00:11:40.033 --> 00:11:44.067
Oxygen, which composes most of
the rest of the gas in this

00:11:44.067 --> 00:11:48.733
room, again occurs in
the diatomic form.

00:11:48.733 --> 00:11:52.733
Each one is 16, and so that's
going to be 32.

00:11:52.733 --> 00:11:57.167
And carbon dioxide, which
you're breathing out--

00:11:57.167 --> 00:11:59.200
carbon is 12.

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:06.133
If I add that to two Os, I'm
going to get 48 -- sorry 44

00:12:06.133 --> 00:12:08.800
for the molecular weight
of carbon dioxide.

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:12.500
So you've probably seen those
numbers before, but that's

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:14.200
what I'm talking about
when I refer to the

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:15.433
molecular weight here.

00:12:18.467 --> 00:12:20.233
Any questions there?

00:12:20.233 --> 00:12:23.100
STUDENT: What's the
R expressed as?

00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:26.033
Is there a different unit--?

00:12:26.033 --> 00:12:27.700
PROFESSOR: The units of it?

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:31.333
The question is about the units
on the universal gas

00:12:31.333 --> 00:12:33.567
constant, and I usually
give them this way.

00:12:33.567 --> 00:12:36.333
I usually write them as--

00:12:36.333 --> 00:12:42.700
the units on that would
be joules per

00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:49.033
kilomole per degree Kelvin.

00:12:49.033 --> 00:12:51.667
By the way, either at the end
of this period or the

00:12:51.667 --> 00:12:55.567
beginning of next, I'm going
to spend about 15 minutes

00:12:55.567 --> 00:12:57.767
talking about units.

00:12:57.767 --> 00:13:00.700
And so if you're a little bit
rusty on units, stand by.

00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:04.667
We're just about to give
a review of the units,

00:13:04.667 --> 00:13:06.867
especially in the SI system,
which we'll be

00:13:06.867 --> 00:13:10.233
using in this course.

00:13:10.233 --> 00:13:11.200
Thanks for that question.

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:15.333
So let's do an example then.

00:13:15.333 --> 00:13:17.800
Let's say that the
temperature--

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:19.033
here's my example.

00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:24.467
Let's say I've got a gas that's
at a temperature of 15

00:13:24.467 --> 00:13:26.467
degrees Celsius.

00:13:26.467 --> 00:13:32.600
Well, that's going to
be about 288 Kelvin.

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:38.200
If it has a molecular
weight of 2, that

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:42.567
would be hydrogen gas.

00:13:42.567 --> 00:13:46.767
We can put those numbers
into the formula.

00:13:46.767 --> 00:13:49.000
It's going to be 3 times--

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.067
oh, I didn't give you
the value, did I?

00:13:51.067 --> 00:13:57.600
The value for R-hat's about
8,314 plus some other decimal

00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:58.633
places after that.

00:13:58.633 --> 00:14:01.633
But let me work it
out in this case.

00:14:01.633 --> 00:14:11.967
So it's going to be Vmolecular
square root of 3 times 8,314.

00:14:11.967 --> 00:14:14.933
Temperature's going to be 288.

00:14:14.933 --> 00:14:17.700
We're going to divide by 2.

00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:24.500
And for that, I get 1,894
meters per second.

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:28.433
And let's do it immediately for
nitrogen, because that's

00:14:28.433 --> 00:14:29.867
the one that's relevant
to this room.

00:14:29.867 --> 00:14:34.333
So for a molecular weight of 28,
well, the formula's going

00:14:34.333 --> 00:14:35.867
to be almost the same
thing, isn't it?

00:14:35.867 --> 00:14:44.900
It's going to be 3 times 8,314
times 288, but in this case

00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:48.367
divided by 28 inside
the square root.

00:14:48.367 --> 00:14:54.033
And that comes out to be
506 meters per second.

00:14:54.033 --> 00:14:56.033
So that's what, typically,
the molecules in

00:14:56.033 --> 00:14:59.000
this room are doing.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:03.067
That's pretty fast. That's
something like

00:15:03.067 --> 00:15:05.433
1,000 miles per hour.

00:15:05.433 --> 00:15:09.367
Those little molecules are
really moving fast in a

00:15:09.367 --> 00:15:11.733
temperature -- in a gas of
the temperature that we

00:15:11.733 --> 00:15:14.833
have in this room.

00:15:14.833 --> 00:15:18.567
So now we've got the two sides
of this argument started.

00:15:18.567 --> 00:15:22.633
It's time to do some
interpretation of it.

00:15:35.933 --> 00:15:41.767
I wanted to consider for a
moment what would happen if

00:15:41.767 --> 00:15:50.167
Vescape was approximately
equal to Vmolecular.

00:15:50.167 --> 00:15:52.933
In other words, if those two
numbers were about the same

00:15:52.933 --> 00:15:56.967
value in an atmosphere,
what would happen?

00:15:56.967 --> 00:16:01.633
Well, at the top of the
atmosphere, some of the

00:16:01.633 --> 00:16:06.733
molecules are moving down and
some of them are moving up.

00:16:06.733 --> 00:16:10.333
Now, I have to say, this is a
typical molecular speed but

00:16:10.333 --> 00:16:12.367
some of them are moving
slower and some of

00:16:12.367 --> 00:16:13.400
them are moving faster.

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:15.967
There's a complete distribution
of speed.

00:16:15.967 --> 00:16:22.867
So it's not every molecule that
would be aiming up and

00:16:22.867 --> 00:16:24.833
have a speed equal
to or greater

00:16:24.833 --> 00:16:26.400
than the escape velocity.

00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:31.700
Probably only 1/4 or 1/5 of the
molecules up there would

00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:34.367
happen to be aiming up with
a speed that would be fast

00:16:34.367 --> 00:16:35.133
enough to leave.

00:16:35.133 --> 00:16:38.733
But remember, they would
leave in an instant.

00:16:38.733 --> 00:16:41.933
In a fraction of a second,
they would be gone.

00:16:41.933 --> 00:16:44.467
In another fraction of a
second, the molecules

00:16:44.467 --> 00:16:47.233
remaining would have had more
collisions, and now some of

00:16:47.233 --> 00:16:52.667
them would be aiming up with a
speed faster than the escape

00:16:52.667 --> 00:16:55.367
velocity, and they would leave.

00:16:55.367 --> 00:16:56.267
And this would continue.

00:16:56.267 --> 00:17:01.033
So in fact, if this were the
case, if the average molecular

00:17:01.033 --> 00:17:04.733
speed was about the same as the
escape velocity, we would

00:17:04.733 --> 00:17:07.733
have an explosive loss
of the atmosphere.

00:17:07.733 --> 00:17:11.067
It would be gone
within moments.

00:17:11.067 --> 00:17:16.933
So when we're asking about
whether a planet can retain an

00:17:16.933 --> 00:17:21.033
atmosphere, we have to use
a more restrictive

00:17:21.033 --> 00:17:21.867
criteria than this.

00:17:21.867 --> 00:17:25.633
Because remember, the Earth has
been around for something

00:17:25.633 --> 00:17:29.233
like 6 billion years,
so we have to use a

00:17:29.233 --> 00:17:30.533
conservative estimate.

00:17:30.533 --> 00:17:37.100
The one that I like to use is to
say, the escape velocity--

00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:43.867
if that is greater than about
ten times the molecular speed,

00:17:43.867 --> 00:17:45.767
then an atmosphere
can be retained.

00:17:55.833 --> 00:17:59.600
It's kind of a rule of thumb to
put that factor of ten in

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:03.233
there, to take into account the
fact that some molecules

00:18:03.233 --> 00:18:05.667
are moving faster than the
typical molecular speed.

00:18:05.667 --> 00:18:08.200
And we have to retain it not
just for an instant.

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:10.033
We have to retain
it over millions

00:18:10.033 --> 00:18:12.233
and millions of years.

00:18:12.233 --> 00:18:16.067
So let's take a look at Earth
for a second and see what we

00:18:16.067 --> 00:18:17.367
can conclude from that.

00:18:17.367 --> 00:18:30.300
If I multiply this by ten, I get
18,940 meters per second,

00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:34.233
about 19,000 meters
per second.

00:18:34.233 --> 00:18:38.633
That is actually greater
than this.

00:18:38.633 --> 00:18:45.233
And so we conclude from that,
that hydrogen could not be

00:18:45.233 --> 00:18:55.700
retained on Earth, could not
be retained on Earth.

00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:00.067
You follow that logic?

00:19:00.067 --> 00:19:02.433
Any questions on that?

00:19:02.433 --> 00:19:05.800
Let's do the same thing
for nitrogen.

00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:09.533
If I multiply this number
by ten, 506 --

00:19:09.533 --> 00:19:12.067
that's about 5,000 meters
per second.

00:19:12.067 --> 00:19:14.533
That's only half
of this number.

00:19:14.533 --> 00:19:21.733
So we conclude that nitrogen
could be retained.

00:19:26.967 --> 00:19:29.767
Well, as it turns out, there's
very little hydrogen in our

00:19:29.767 --> 00:19:33.333
atmosphere, and that's
probably why.

00:19:33.333 --> 00:19:36.000
Because any hydrogen that was
there in the beginning has

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.200
been lost by this process.

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:44.367
Instead, our atmosphere is
dominated by nitrogen, mostly,

00:19:44.367 --> 00:19:47.133
but also oxygen that would move
even a little bit slower,

00:19:47.133 --> 00:19:50.500
because it has a molecular
weight even greater.

00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:52.133
So that could be retained.

00:19:52.133 --> 00:19:54.800
There's some carbon dioxide
in our atmosphere.

00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:56.000
That could be retained.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.433
So we've already learned
something about the Earth with

00:19:59.433 --> 00:20:00.567
this little exercise.

00:20:00.567 --> 00:20:05.100
It's probably lost its light
gases like hydrogen and

00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:07.533
helium, even if it was there
in the beginning, which I

00:20:07.533 --> 00:20:10.433
think it probably was.

00:20:10.433 --> 00:20:14.367
But it's been able to retain
the somewhat heavier gases

00:20:14.367 --> 00:20:20.733
such as nitrogen, oxygen,
and carbon dioxide.

00:20:20.733 --> 00:20:22.400
Questions on that?

00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:22.867
Yes?

00:20:22.867 --> 00:20:23.600
STUDENT: Is there a way to
determine how fast the Earth

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:24.867
-- or when the Earth would
lose certain gases ?

00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:31.833
PROFESSOR: Well, you'd
have to go beyond-- this

00:20:31.833 --> 00:20:34.167
is kind of a crude argument.

00:20:34.167 --> 00:20:36.667
It doesn't tell you the rate.

00:20:36.667 --> 00:20:40.500
To do that, you'd have to know
something about the rate at

00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:44.600
which molecules are colliding
and restoring that set of

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:46.267
molecules that are
aiming upwards.

00:20:46.267 --> 00:20:48.400
It would depend on that
to a certain extent.

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:49.967
And there are some
other processes

00:20:49.967 --> 00:20:50.700
that may play a role.

00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:55.400
For example, the solar wind
coming from the sun will

00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:58.433
sometimes take the light
molecules and sweep them away.

00:20:58.433 --> 00:21:00.833
I've not included that
in this argument.

00:21:00.833 --> 00:21:02.833
So there's a few other things
you would have to include to

00:21:02.833 --> 00:21:06.233
get a quantitative
estimate of that.

00:21:06.233 --> 00:21:08.300
This I would--I have to admit
then-- that's a good question,

00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:11.900
and this, I would say, is more
of a qualitative or an

00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:14.600
approximate approach
to that question.

00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:17.267
It doesn't include all the
physics and it doesn't give us

00:21:17.267 --> 00:21:21.333
a quantitative answer of how
rapidly the atmosphere would

00:21:21.333 --> 00:21:25.167
be lost. But that's what we can
do with what we have here.

00:21:25.167 --> 00:21:26.367
Other questions?

00:21:26.367 --> 00:21:27.800
Yes?

00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:30.167
STUDENT: Where does
the ten come from?

00:21:30.167 --> 00:21:32.233
PROFESSOR: Well, it's a fudge factor.

00:21:32.233 --> 00:21:33.033
I admit this.

00:21:33.033 --> 00:21:35.933
The question is, this
factor of ten,

00:21:35.933 --> 00:21:37.967
where did it come from?

00:21:37.967 --> 00:21:41.800
What I've done is try to use a
number that is consistent with

00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:43.900
some of these more sophisticated
calculations.

00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:46.467
You can find in the literature
people have worked out this

00:21:46.467 --> 00:21:48.767
problem in great detail,
because it's of central

00:21:48.767 --> 00:21:51.000
importance to the history
of the Earth.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:54.900
And I, from those complicated
calculations--

00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:57.767
I've extracted this as kind
of a rule of thumb.

00:21:57.767 --> 00:22:01.300
So I don't know that I would
rely on this, but it gives us

00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:04.833
a rough estimate of how
to judge things.

00:22:04.833 --> 00:22:07.733
I'm going to show you in a
minute that this argument

00:22:07.733 --> 00:22:10.800
makes some sense when you
look at all the planets

00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:11.733
together, as well.

00:22:11.733 --> 00:22:15.133
And that won't necessarily
confirm that that factor of

00:22:15.133 --> 00:22:18.500
ten is right, but at least it'll
give us a sense that the

00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:22.367
argument is approximately
correct.

00:22:26.333 --> 00:22:26.633
OK.

00:22:26.633 --> 00:22:31.467
Now, so what I did, following
this kind of an argument, was

00:22:31.467 --> 00:22:38.733
to take all the planets and
moons in the solar system.

00:22:38.733 --> 00:22:44.667
And I did an estimate for the
temperature of each one.

00:22:44.667 --> 00:22:47.567
And we know something about the
gravitational field and

00:22:47.567 --> 00:22:49.767
the radius of each planet.

00:22:49.767 --> 00:22:55.933
And so I came up with a ranked
list where it's basically the

00:22:55.933 --> 00:23:01.000
ratio of the escape velocity
to the molecular velocity.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:09.167
So if a planet has a large
escape velocity, and a small

00:23:09.167 --> 00:23:13.900
expected molecular speed, I
ranked it high on the list. If

00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:15.800
it has a low escape velocity--

00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:19.967
like a small planet, not much
gravity, fast-moving

00:23:19.967 --> 00:23:21.600
molecules--

00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:22.500
I put it low on this.

00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:26.067
So this is a ranked list, my
ranked list, of where I would

00:23:26.067 --> 00:23:31.033
expect to find atmospheres
in the solar system.

00:23:31.033 --> 00:23:33.667
What's going to be first
on the list?

00:23:33.667 --> 00:23:35.100
Jupiter's going to
be first. Why?

00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:36.500
STUDENT: Because it's
the largest planet.

00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:37.233
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:23:37.233 --> 00:23:39.767
So Jupiter has the
largest mass.

00:23:39.767 --> 00:23:43.333
It's also fairly far out in the
solar system, so the gases

00:23:43.333 --> 00:23:45.533
are not particularly hot.

00:23:45.533 --> 00:23:49.867
So this is large and that's
pretty small, so indeed

00:23:49.867 --> 00:23:56.100
Jupiter is first on the list.
And right behind it comes

00:23:56.100 --> 00:24:00.233
Saturn for similar reasons.

00:24:00.233 --> 00:24:04.067
Neptune, Uranus.

00:24:07.533 --> 00:24:11.233
Then comes our planet, Earth.

00:24:11.233 --> 00:24:12.500
Venus.

00:24:16.733 --> 00:24:17.700
Pluto--

00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:21.933
poor Pluto, no longer
a planet.

00:24:21.933 --> 00:24:28.100
Triton, which is a satellite
of Neptune--

00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:29.567
or say, a moon of Neptune.

00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:40.167
Then comes Mars, then
comes Titan--

00:24:40.167 --> 00:24:42.933
T-I-T-A-N--

00:24:42.933 --> 00:24:45.133
which is a satellite
of Saturn.

00:24:49.067 --> 00:24:50.967
And let me continue the list
a little bit longer.

00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:30.033
Ganymede, Io, Callisto, Europa,
Mercury, and our moon.

00:25:30.033 --> 00:25:33.200
And then I stop there.

00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:35.200
Of course, I could go on and
on, because there's lots of

00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:40.567
other smaller moons in
our solar system.

00:25:40.567 --> 00:25:43.467
But I wanted to get at least to
Mercury, which is the other

00:25:43.467 --> 00:25:47.533
planet, and I wanted to get to
our own moon in order to make

00:25:47.533 --> 00:25:50.567
the list interesting for us.

00:25:50.567 --> 00:25:54.000
So that's the ranked
list. Now what's--

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:57.900
we know a lot about this,
because we can detect

00:25:57.900 --> 00:26:03.167
planetary atmospheres
from a distance.

00:26:03.167 --> 00:26:05.233
We can detect it by going there

00:26:05.233 --> 00:26:07.067
with an unmanned vehicle.

00:26:07.067 --> 00:26:10.400
So we know, pretty much, whether
these objects have

00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:11.167
atmospheres now.

00:26:11.167 --> 00:26:13.867
And I can draw a line under
there, and actually the line

00:26:13.867 --> 00:26:16.867
is right where I broke
the columns.

00:26:16.867 --> 00:26:18.267
That's roughly the line.

00:26:18.267 --> 00:26:21.767
From observations, we think
that these planets have

00:26:21.767 --> 00:26:25.733
atmospheres and these do not.

00:26:28.333 --> 00:26:31.867
So our ranking based on that
was pretty successful.

00:26:31.867 --> 00:26:35.033
Maybe not quantitatively, but
at least qualitatively, it

00:26:35.033 --> 00:26:40.200
gave us an idea of where we
could find atmospheres in the

00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:42.700
solar system.

00:26:42.700 --> 00:26:43.900
Are there questions on that?

00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:49.500
It's a pretty simple argument
and I think pretty powerful,

00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:52.800
to give us that kind
of good result.

00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:55.533
So let me try to make a
little sketch of the

00:26:55.533 --> 00:26:57.567
solar system, then.

00:26:57.567 --> 00:26:58.900
Because there's a little
more that has to

00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:00.200
be said about this.

00:27:03.033 --> 00:27:06.867
Because remember, what I didn't
bring into here was the

00:27:06.867 --> 00:27:08.333
molecular weight of the gases.

00:27:08.333 --> 00:27:12.333
I used a constant value for
capital M as I did these

00:27:12.333 --> 00:27:13.300
calculations.

00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:19.300
So if we've got the sun here,
then going out, in order,

00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:28.467
you've got Mercury, Venus,
Earth, Mars.

00:27:28.467 --> 00:27:30.300
And then, quite a bit larger--

00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:33.467
I'll draw these with a little
bit of size to them, but then

00:27:33.467 --> 00:27:38.167
quite a bit larger you
have Jupiter, Saturn.

00:27:38.167 --> 00:27:41.633
A little smaller, Uranus
and Neptune.

00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:51.767
So now let's consider this
molecular weight effect, the

00:27:51.767 --> 00:27:57.167
heavy gases versus the
lighter gases.

00:27:57.167 --> 00:28:00.600
For mercury, it turns out that
both would be lost. I'm going

00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:04.067
to put two arrows here, and I'm
going to label one L and

00:28:04.067 --> 00:28:09.000
one H. L for the light gases,
like hydrogen, and H for the

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:14.033
heavy gases like nitrogen,
for example.

00:28:14.033 --> 00:28:17.100
Mercury would lose them both,
because it's a pretty small

00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:19.267
planet and it's quite hot.

00:28:19.267 --> 00:28:21.533
So if there were molecules
there, they'd be moving quite

00:28:21.533 --> 00:28:23.767
fast. Venus--

00:28:23.767 --> 00:28:28.100
the light gases can leave but
the heavy gases are retained.

00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:32.667
So I've drawn that molecule
trajectory coming back into

00:28:32.667 --> 00:28:33.967
the planet.

00:28:33.967 --> 00:28:36.733
The same for Earth.

00:28:36.733 --> 00:28:40.733
The light gases leave, the
heavy gases come back.

00:28:40.733 --> 00:28:44.000
The same for Mars.

00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:53.300
But for the outer planets, both
the heavy and the light

00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:55.100
gases come back.

00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:05.333
I'm tempted to put a little
face on that.

00:29:05.333 --> 00:29:09.433
So that gives us some idea of
what particular molecules can

00:29:09.433 --> 00:29:13.767
be found on individual
planets.

00:29:13.767 --> 00:29:18.933
We're going to find only heavier
gases in these three

00:29:18.933 --> 00:29:20.600
planets, Venus, Earth,
and Mars.

00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:24.067
But we can find heavy gases but
also the light gases, the

00:29:24.067 --> 00:29:28.167
hydrogen and the helium, can be
retained for those outer,

00:29:28.167 --> 00:29:30.433
more massive planets.

00:29:30.433 --> 00:29:34.933
So while we have this up here,
let me talk about a couple

00:29:34.933 --> 00:29:38.267
other characteristics of
planets that have some

00:29:38.267 --> 00:29:41.433
interest in relation
to atmospheres.

00:29:41.433 --> 00:29:44.933
For example, here's a
category of whether

00:29:44.933 --> 00:29:46.300
there is a solid surface.

00:29:49.433 --> 00:29:53.767
A solid surface, something
you can stand on.

00:29:53.767 --> 00:30:02.867
And the answer is yes, yes,
yes, yes, no, no, no, no.

00:30:02.867 --> 00:30:08.133
What happens--if you sent a
spaceship to Jupiter and tried

00:30:08.133 --> 00:30:11.767
to land on the surface, you
would penetrate down into this

00:30:11.767 --> 00:30:13.600
massive atmosphere.

00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:18.767
And it would get denser and
denser and denser, and after a

00:30:18.767 --> 00:30:20.533
while you'd begin to wonder
whether you were

00:30:20.533 --> 00:30:23.433
in a gas or a liquid.

00:30:23.433 --> 00:30:26.967
But there wouldn't be any
particular interface.

00:30:26.967 --> 00:30:29.067
Eventually, as you came further
down, you're pretty

00:30:29.067 --> 00:30:30.767
sure you're no longer
in a gas.

00:30:30.767 --> 00:30:32.500
You're almost certainly
in a liquid.

00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:35.233
And as you kept going down, it's
going to get a bit--more

00:30:35.233 --> 00:30:37.300
and more like a solid,
perhaps.

00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:39.133
But never with an interface.

00:30:39.133 --> 00:30:42.767
So the point is that
there's no surface.

00:30:42.767 --> 00:30:45.333
There's no solid surface on
these outer planets, whereas

00:30:45.333 --> 00:30:48.500
the inner ones you can land
on it, walk around.

00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:51.667
They may be hostile in terms of
their environment, but at

00:30:51.667 --> 00:30:54.000
least there is a
place to stand.

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:57.367
What about the temperature?

00:30:57.367 --> 00:31:03.767
Well, extremely hot and
no atmosphere on Mars.

00:31:06.467 --> 00:31:08.767
This one is--Venus is extremely
hot as well.

00:31:08.767 --> 00:31:11.700
Earth-- well, we live there,
so it's OK I guess.

00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:17.033
Mars may be OK but it's
a little cold for us.

00:31:17.033 --> 00:31:21.100
It's below the freezing point
of water most of the time.

00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:25.233
And for these others, well, I
don't know what to write down.

00:31:25.233 --> 00:31:29.667
Because here I'm kind of
assuming that I can stand on

00:31:29.667 --> 00:31:32.400
the surface and break out a
thermometer and measure the

00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:33.300
temperature.

00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:35.167
But if there's no solid
surface, then what

00:31:35.167 --> 00:31:36.667
temperature do I use?

00:31:36.667 --> 00:31:40.100
So I can't really fill this
in, because it would get

00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:42.433
hotter and hotter and hotter
as you go down deeper and

00:31:42.433 --> 00:31:43.233
deeper in the planet.

00:31:43.233 --> 00:31:46.300
There isn't any particular
reference point from which to

00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:49.933
say, Jupiter's a hot planet,
or Jupiter's a cold planet.

00:31:49.933 --> 00:31:54.300
The question is really, I would
say, ill-posed because

00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:56.600
there's no solid surface.

00:31:56.600 --> 00:31:58.933
What about habitability?

00:31:58.933 --> 00:32:02.533
I think you can pretty much
guess for yourself, then, that

00:32:02.533 --> 00:32:05.733
these wouldn't be habitable
for a number of reasons.

00:32:05.733 --> 00:32:09.500
And neither would Mercury
and Venus.

00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:12.167
Ours--our planet, Earth,
probably, certainly yes, and

00:32:12.167 --> 00:32:15.200
Mars would be, well, it'd
be a question mark.

00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:18.533
I mean it's--there's not very
much atmosphere there.

00:32:18.533 --> 00:32:20.867
You might be able to build some
kind of enclosure and

00:32:20.867 --> 00:32:25.067
live within--inside some kind
of a pressurized enclosure.

00:32:25.067 --> 00:32:27.467
But it wouldn't be a very
pleasant existence for us.

00:32:27.467 --> 00:32:31.967
So habitability is pretty much
limited to Earth, and maybe

00:32:31.967 --> 00:32:35.600
Mars if you want to extend the
definition a little bit.

00:32:38.433 --> 00:32:39.667
Questions on that?

00:32:42.633 --> 00:32:43.300
Give me just a minute.

00:32:43.300 --> 00:32:44.967
I want to show you a
few things here.

00:33:22.833 --> 00:33:25.000
So this is the diagram I already
really have on the

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:26.167
blackboard.

00:33:26.167 --> 00:33:28.167
It's not to scale either.

00:33:28.167 --> 00:33:30.200
I mean these distances
are not to scale.

00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:34.467
But you get some idea of the
fact that these inner planets

00:33:34.467 --> 00:33:37.700
are a lot smaller than
the outer planets.

00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:39.933
For example, we know Jupiter has
an atmosphere because we

00:33:39.933 --> 00:33:42.867
can see these cloud patterns
moving around

00:33:42.867 --> 00:33:43.933
at very great speeds.

00:33:43.933 --> 00:33:47.233
And the Great Red Spot, which I
don't think is shown there,

00:33:47.233 --> 00:33:52.000
is a giant vortex like a
hurricane, but 1,000 times the

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:56.433
size, sitting in Jupiter's
atmosphere, winds

00:33:56.433 --> 00:33:57.467
swirling around it.

00:33:57.467 --> 00:34:01.867
So it's obvious that Jupiter
has an atmosphere.

00:34:01.867 --> 00:34:03.500
But so do all of these.

00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:06.667
And so does Mars and
Venus and Earth.

00:34:06.667 --> 00:34:10.667
It's only Mercury on this
diagram that does not have a

00:34:10.667 --> 00:34:11.933
planetary atmosphere.

00:34:14.233 --> 00:34:18.267
So it's convenient to break up
the planets into two general

00:34:18.267 --> 00:34:18.833
categories.

00:34:18.833 --> 00:34:21.900
The so-called terrestrial
planets, which

00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:24.300
are a bit like Earth--

00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:26.600
they comprise Mercury, Venus,
Earth, and Mars.

00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:30.467
They're small, they're dense,
they have rocky surfaces, they

00:34:30.467 --> 00:34:33.033
rotate relatively slowly
on their axis.

00:34:33.033 --> 00:34:34.733
For Earth, it takes,
as you know,

00:34:34.733 --> 00:34:37.000
twenty-four hours to go around.

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:37.933
The atmosphere--

00:34:37.933 --> 00:34:41.800
well, none in the case of
Mercury, but the heavier gases

00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:47.100
in the case of Earth, Mars,
and Venus, with molecular

00:34:47.100 --> 00:34:53.967
weight somewhere in the range of
four to fifty, I would say.

00:34:53.967 --> 00:34:55.767
Whereas, the Jovian planets--

00:34:55.767 --> 00:34:59.367
that is, the planets that are
like Jupiter in some way--

00:34:59.367 --> 00:35:03.667
are much larger, much
lower density.

00:35:03.667 --> 00:35:07.367
They have soft surfaces, they
rotate more rapidly than

00:35:07.367 --> 00:35:10.133
Earth, and their atmosphere
is primarily

00:35:10.133 --> 00:35:11.633
composed of light gases.

00:35:11.633 --> 00:35:16.933
Mostly hydrogen with a molecular
weight of two in the

00:35:16.933 --> 00:35:22.700
diatomic form, and helium, just
independent helium atoms

00:35:22.700 --> 00:35:26.100
with a molecular
weight of four.

00:35:29.733 --> 00:35:33.933
So there are the terrestrial
planets.

00:35:33.933 --> 00:35:37.433
I'll show you more about this,
but that's Earth, Venus, Mars,

00:35:37.433 --> 00:35:38.667
and Mercury.

00:35:40.900 --> 00:35:44.100
And the outer planets,
the Jovian planets.

00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:46.167
That's the list. I already have
it on the board, so you

00:35:46.167 --> 00:35:48.867
don't have to write
that down again.

00:35:48.867 --> 00:35:49.800
This is also a review.

00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:50.733
I think we've been
through this.

00:35:50.733 --> 00:35:52.267
But Mercury has no atmosphere.

00:35:52.267 --> 00:35:57.167
Venus has a massive
CO2 atmosphere.

00:35:57.167 --> 00:36:01.833
It is entirely covered
by clouds.

00:36:01.833 --> 00:36:05.433
100% cloud cover all the
time, which makes it

00:36:05.433 --> 00:36:08.300
a very bright planet.

00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:14.300
In fact, do you know the
colloquial term for Venus

00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:16.733
among astronomers, or
farmers, or sailors?

00:36:16.733 --> 00:36:19.233
STUDENT: Do they call it
the greenhouse planet?

00:36:19.233 --> 00:36:22.300
PROFESSOR: No, not colloquially.

00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:23.100
The evening star.

00:36:23.100 --> 00:36:24.200
It's called the evening star.

00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:25.467
That's an odd name, isn't it?

00:36:25.467 --> 00:36:28.267
Because it's not
a star at all.

00:36:28.267 --> 00:36:32.000
But when the sun sets in the
evening and the sky darkens,

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.867
that's usually the first
thing you can see.

00:36:34.867 --> 00:36:36.633
So the evening star,
they call it.

00:36:36.633 --> 00:36:37.200
Why is it?

00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:40.400
Because it's--well it's
relatively large, relatively

00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:42.467
close, but it's very bright.

00:36:42.467 --> 00:36:45.567
It reflects--it's completely
covered with white clouds,

00:36:45.567 --> 00:36:47.900
reflects a lot of sunlight,
and makes it

00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:49.167
easy for us to see.

00:36:52.233 --> 00:36:55.400
It turns out, though,
that it also has a

00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:57.433
super greenhouse effect.

00:36:57.433 --> 00:37:04.333
And it's a little bit closer
to the sun than we are, but

00:37:04.333 --> 00:37:08.267
its temperature is even hotter
than you would expect based on

00:37:08.267 --> 00:37:11.467
that proximity to the sun.

00:37:11.467 --> 00:37:13.967
It has a really super greenhouse
effect that brings

00:37:13.967 --> 00:37:19.733
it up to a temperature that's
in the order of 600 Celsius,

00:37:19.733 --> 00:37:21.667
way, way, way above the
boiling point and

00:37:21.667 --> 00:37:22.800
so on and so forth.

00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:25.400
So a very hot planet because
of the greenhouse effect.

00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:26.500
The Earth we know has a

00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:28.633
nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere primarily.

00:37:28.633 --> 00:37:30.200
Partly cloudy.

00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:32.000
Water can exist in
the liquid form.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:33.967
We have life, and we
have ice caps.

00:37:33.967 --> 00:37:38.400
We have frozen water, in this
case in the form of snow or

00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:44.467
frozen seawater, at the caps,
at the poles of the planet.

00:37:44.467 --> 00:37:48.967
Mars has a CO2 atmosphere
but not much of it.

00:37:51.667 --> 00:37:53.567
There may have been
water there once.

00:37:53.567 --> 00:37:55.467
We don't know if it's
still there now.

00:37:55.467 --> 00:37:56.667
There may have been
life there once.

00:37:56.667 --> 00:37:58.133
We don't think it's there now.

00:37:58.133 --> 00:37:59.567
But it too has some ice caps.

00:37:59.567 --> 00:38:02.667
If you look at the planet, it
has these kind of snowy

00:38:02.667 --> 00:38:05.033
regions near the poles.

00:38:05.033 --> 00:38:06.733
We don't think it's
frozen water.

00:38:06.733 --> 00:38:09.067
We think it's frozen C02.

00:38:09.067 --> 00:38:12.133
What's frozen CO2 called?

00:38:12.133 --> 00:38:12.967
Dry ice.

00:38:12.967 --> 00:38:18.033
Dry ice is what we
call frozen CO2.

00:38:18.033 --> 00:38:23.000
Mars seems to have dry ice ice
caps on the poles that change

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:25.700
a bit with the season.

00:38:25.700 --> 00:38:27.333
So the point here--

00:38:27.333 --> 00:38:29.133
we're not going to be studying,
in the rest of the

00:38:29.133 --> 00:38:31.133
course, much more about
these other planets.

00:38:31.133 --> 00:38:34.133
But the point of today's lecture
is to put Earth in

00:38:34.133 --> 00:38:39.933
some kind of context, especially
in relation to how

00:38:39.933 --> 00:38:42.867
our atmosphere is composed,
how it's retained.

00:38:42.867 --> 00:38:45.000
Later on, we'll be talking about
the greenhouse effect on

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:49.100
Venus and why that might
be a concern for us.

00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:50.367
Questions here?

00:38:52.667 --> 00:38:54.033
So there's Mercury.

00:38:54.033 --> 00:38:57.933
A rugged surface,
pockmarked with

00:38:57.933 --> 00:39:01.800
meteorite collision craters.

00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:03.767
Remember, no atmosphere.

00:39:03.767 --> 00:39:04.967
There's Venus.

00:39:04.967 --> 00:39:08.467
Now, neither of these
pictures of Venus is

00:39:08.467 --> 00:39:10.867
taken in visible light.

00:39:10.867 --> 00:39:14.533
What you would see with your eye
is a uniform, featureless

00:39:14.533 --> 00:39:16.167
white surface.

00:39:16.167 --> 00:39:19.900
When you look at it in the
ultraviolet, you begin to see

00:39:19.900 --> 00:39:22.900
a little bit of difference
between some of the clouds,

00:39:22.900 --> 00:39:25.600
and these would be moving very
rapidly around the planet, if

00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:27.167
you had a movie of this.

00:39:27.167 --> 00:39:29.833
So you can see-distinguish, a
little bit, low clouds from

00:39:29.833 --> 00:39:31.967
high clouds and see that
they're moving.

00:39:31.967 --> 00:39:35.833
When you use radar to look at
Venus, you can penetrate

00:39:35.833 --> 00:39:37.667
through the clouds in
the atmosphere.

00:39:37.667 --> 00:39:40.367
And you see that it has
a rough surface,

00:39:40.367 --> 00:39:42.367
indicated like that.

00:39:45.367 --> 00:39:47.400
Earth, of course, you're
familiar with.

00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:49.833
It's partly cloudy.

00:39:49.833 --> 00:39:53.433
Those clouds are composed
of condensed water.

00:39:53.433 --> 00:39:56.000
We'll talk a lot about that.

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:58.733
Mars has an atmosphere.

00:39:58.733 --> 00:40:02.200
You occasionally, I believe,
see a cloud.

00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:06.733
A rare cloud will appear in
the Martian atmosphere.

00:40:06.733 --> 00:40:08.200
There's an ice cap up there.

00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:11.667
But for the most part you don't
see anything moving

00:40:11.667 --> 00:40:13.633
around on Mars.

00:40:13.633 --> 00:40:15.467
But we know there's an
atmosphere there.

00:40:15.467 --> 00:40:16.867
We have lots of-- we've
been there.

00:40:16.867 --> 00:40:19.433
We've had landers there,
I mean, not humans.

00:40:19.433 --> 00:40:23.600
We've had landers there, and
from a number of other clues,

00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:30.933
we know that there's a thin
CO2 atmosphere on Mars.

00:40:30.933 --> 00:40:34.300
Now, you've all had--I suspect
you've all had a chemistry

00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:36.600
course and seen the periodic
table of the elements.

00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:39.300
I just wanted to show this to
you to remind you a little bit

00:40:39.300 --> 00:40:40.233
about that.

00:40:40.233 --> 00:40:42.800
What are the molecules we're
going to mostly be concerned

00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:44.867
with in this course?

00:40:44.867 --> 00:40:48.200
What are the elements that
make up those molecules?

00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:54.367
In red, I have circled the
elements that you find most

00:40:54.367 --> 00:40:57.500
often in atmospheres.

00:40:57.500 --> 00:41:03.733
So, for example, nitrogen in
the diatomic form is the

00:41:03.733 --> 00:41:07.033
dominant molecule in the
Earth's atmosphere.

00:41:07.033 --> 00:41:11.133
Next after that is oxygen
in the diatomic form.

00:41:11.133 --> 00:41:13.700
And there's a little bit
of argon, also, in our

00:41:13.700 --> 00:41:14.933
atmosphere.

00:41:14.933 --> 00:41:17.167
There's a variable
amount of CO2.

00:41:17.167 --> 00:41:20.233
Combine carbon and oxygen
and you can get CO2.

00:41:20.233 --> 00:41:22.700
I'll show you a list of some
of these other important

00:41:22.700 --> 00:41:23.833
molecules in just a minute.

00:41:23.833 --> 00:41:30.767
But it's the red ones, with
their light masses and their

00:41:30.767 --> 00:41:34.033
preference for either bonding
not at all with other

00:41:34.033 --> 00:41:37.900
molecules, or their preference
for bonding with other light

00:41:37.900 --> 00:41:41.767
molecules, that makes them good
candidates for being an

00:41:41.767 --> 00:41:45.300
atmospheric gas.

00:41:45.300 --> 00:41:48.767
In the black circles are
the dominant elements

00:41:48.767 --> 00:41:52.167
in the solid Earth.

00:41:52.167 --> 00:41:54.833
Sodium, manganese, potassium,
calcium,

00:41:54.833 --> 00:41:57.267
iron, aluminum, silicon.

00:41:57.267 --> 00:42:00.767
So all these others are found as
well, but the dominant ones

00:42:00.767 --> 00:42:02.300
are the ones I've
found in black.

00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:06.200
Now, they--first of all, they
tend to be heavier by

00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:06.933
themselves.

00:42:06.933 --> 00:42:12.900
And then the way they bond will
make them heavier still.

00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:15.267
And therefore you wouldn't
expect to find them as

00:42:15.267 --> 00:42:17.200
atmospheric gases.

00:42:17.200 --> 00:42:21.600
You'd rather find them in some
more condensed body like the

00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:24.333
solid Earth.

00:42:24.333 --> 00:42:28.133
STUDENT: Are those found
in the outer planets?

00:42:28.133 --> 00:42:30.000
PROFESSOR: The question is whether these

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:31.833
molecules are found in
the outer planets.

00:42:31.833 --> 00:42:35.733
They all are, yes-- in various
proportions, though.

00:42:35.733 --> 00:42:40.167
The ratio of the abundances of
the elements does change a

00:42:40.167 --> 00:42:43.300
little bit from planet to
planet, but not dramatically.

00:42:43.300 --> 00:42:46.733
The planets were all formed
more or less from the same

00:42:46.733 --> 00:42:50.267
type of material, and so if you
include everything all the

00:42:50.267 --> 00:42:53.067
way from the surface--top of the
atmosphere to the center

00:42:53.067 --> 00:42:56.467
of the planet, there's a
remarkable similarity between

00:42:56.467 --> 00:42:59.867
the compositions of the
different planets.

00:42:59.867 --> 00:43:02.633
For example, in the case of
Jupiter, it probably has all

00:43:02.633 --> 00:43:04.400
of these elements.

00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:08.367
They're probably down in the
interior parts of the planet.

00:43:08.367 --> 00:43:14.267
And up near the--in the upper
parts, you only have hydrogen

00:43:14.267 --> 00:43:16.900
and helium up in
the atmosphere.

00:43:16.900 --> 00:43:21.333
But those are probably
all in there as well.

00:43:21.333 --> 00:43:23.767
Any other questions here?

00:43:23.767 --> 00:43:24.000
Good.

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:25.833
I think that maybe--

00:43:25.833 --> 00:43:26.100
yes.

00:43:26.100 --> 00:43:26.767
So here's some of the

00:43:26.767 --> 00:43:28.833
important atmospheric molecules.

00:43:28.833 --> 00:43:32.433
You should be aware of these
at least. If I gave you the

00:43:32.433 --> 00:43:37.867
name, you could give me the
formula and so on, for these.

00:43:37.867 --> 00:43:40.200
We've already talked
about diatomic

00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:42.233
nitrogen, oxygen, CO2.

00:43:42.233 --> 00:43:46.667
Methane is an important
greenhouse gas, CH4, carbon

00:43:46.667 --> 00:43:48.467
with four hydrogens.

00:43:48.467 --> 00:43:54.600
Ozone is simply adding another
oxygen atom to diatomic.

00:43:54.600 --> 00:43:58.767
It's just triatomic oxygen.

00:43:58.767 --> 00:44:00.400
Water is H2O, you know that.

00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:01.533
Diatomic--

00:44:01.533 --> 00:44:02.800
so we've been through
most of these.

00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:05.933
I won't spend any more-- some
of these are important air

00:44:05.933 --> 00:44:08.167
pollutants in the earth's
atmosphere.

00:44:08.167 --> 00:44:11.767
So we'll be coming back to
studying this group, for

00:44:11.767 --> 00:44:13.833
example, later on in
the course when we

00:44:13.833 --> 00:44:15.067
talk about air pollution.

00:44:18.900 --> 00:44:20.100
I'm going to end with that.

00:44:20.100 --> 00:44:22.967
Let's see.

00:44:22.967 --> 00:44:24.433
We're going to be--in a day or
so, we're going to be talking

00:44:24.433 --> 00:44:27.167
about the vertical temperature
structure on Earth.

00:44:27.167 --> 00:44:29.867
And since I'm not a very good
artist, I thought I

00:44:29.867 --> 00:44:30.633
would show you this.

00:44:30.633 --> 00:44:32.600
But this is in your
textbook as well.

00:44:32.600 --> 00:44:35.233
This is the temperature in the
Earth's atmosphere as a

00:44:35.233 --> 00:44:38.300
function of altitude.

00:44:38.300 --> 00:44:41.833
And it starts around fifteen
degrees Celsius, and that's

00:44:41.833 --> 00:44:47.800
the example I used today, and
then it cools off, warms up

00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:51.933
again with altitude, cools off
again, warms up with altitude.

00:44:51.933 --> 00:44:55.133
Think about that profile, and in
a day or two, I'm going to

00:44:55.133 --> 00:44:58.967
be asking you to speculate
about why it is that the

00:44:58.967 --> 00:45:02.167
Earth's atmosphere has this
peculiar structure.

00:45:02.167 --> 00:45:04.867
The other planets, by the
way, have a structure

00:45:04.867 --> 00:45:06.167
that's a bit simpler.

00:45:06.167 --> 00:45:10.567
It cools and then warms, just
one cooling trend and one

00:45:10.567 --> 00:45:13.300
warming trend in the atmospheres
of most of the

00:45:13.300 --> 00:45:14.533
other planets.

00:45:14.533 --> 00:45:17.033
So there's something unique
about our planet that gives it

00:45:17.033 --> 00:45:24.433
this layer cake structure
of temperature.

00:45:24.433 --> 00:45:25.300
So let's see.

00:45:25.300 --> 00:45:26.400
That takes care of that.

00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:32.800
And let me ask again if there
any questions at this point.

00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:33.467
Question in front.

00:45:33.467 --> 00:45:34.000
Yes?

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:36.767
STUDENT: Are these slides
on--will they be online?

00:45:36.767 --> 00:45:37.967
PROFESSOR: They will be.

00:45:37.967 --> 00:45:39.700
By the end of the day,
they'll be up there.

00:45:39.700 --> 00:45:40.933
Yeah.

00:45:50.467 --> 00:45:52.967
OK.

00:45:52.967 --> 00:45:54.733
We're--I don't have time to
start the next subject.

00:45:54.733 --> 00:45:57.067
So let's call it quits today.

00:45:57.067 --> 00:46:00.900
When you see me on Monday, I'm
going to dive into this review

00:46:00.900 --> 00:46:05.333
of the SI system of units.

00:46:05.333 --> 00:46:07.967
We're going to talk about
the perfect gas law.

00:46:07.967 --> 00:46:09.933
We're going to talk about
warm air and cold

00:46:09.933 --> 00:46:11.600
air rising and sinking.

00:46:11.600 --> 00:46:15.600
We're going to start into some
of the physics of how our

00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:17.833
atmosphere works on Monday.

00:46:17.833 --> 00:46:19.100
See you then.

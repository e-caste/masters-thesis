00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:04.183
Professor Amy
Hungerford: All right.

00:00:04.183 --> 00:00:07.170
So, today we're going to talk
about Everything is

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.683
Illuminated, and Eli has
actually agreed to stand next to

00:00:10.683 --> 00:00:13.787
me for the whole lecture and
translate my lecture into

00:00:13.787 --> 00:00:16.746
Ukrainian dialect.
Thank you, Eli.

00:00:16.746 --> 00:00:21.907
I'll call you up in a minute.
For anyone visiting the class

00:00:21.907 --> 00:00:26.324
today, what we are doing is
talking about Jonathan Safran

00:00:26.324 --> 00:00:29.400
Foer's Everything is
Illuminated.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.302
This book was chosen by the
class as the last book on the

00:00:33.302 --> 00:00:36.880
syllabus, and Eli here gave a
wonderful presentation,

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.784
reading from it in a very funny
Ukrainian accent,

00:00:41.784 --> 00:00:46.280
and I think that's why
everybody chose it.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.120
God knows if there would be
another reason.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:57.240
No. Just kidding.
Now, when you meet a new

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:03.227
novel, there are various things
you need to do after you've

00:01:03.227 --> 00:01:07.150
decided whether you like it or
not,

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.568
that is, if you're either a
professor in an English class

00:01:10.568 --> 00:01:14.337
having to teach it,
or you are a student having to

00:01:14.337 --> 00:01:18.069
talk about it or write about in
your papers.

00:01:18.069 --> 00:01:20.935
Beyond that,
even beyond vocational

00:01:20.935 --> 00:01:26.330
necessity, there is the desire,
I hope, that many people have,

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.152
to understand how new work fits
into the body of existing

00:01:30.152 --> 00:01:32.698
literature.
And, especially,

00:01:32.698 --> 00:01:39.230
I think that's the case when an
author is as openly ambitious as

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:43.284
Jonathan Safran Foer is.
It is very clear,

00:01:43.284 --> 00:01:46.900
the minute you open this up and
you start reading,

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.737
that Foer is aiming at a
conversation with literature

00:01:50.737 --> 00:01:54.544
that has preceded him.
It's also clear from his

00:01:54.544 --> 00:01:58.550
interviews, and I was
particularly struck by something

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.329
he said in an interview about
his second novel,

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:05.102
Extremely Loud and
Incredibly Close,

00:02:05.102 --> 00:02:08.583
which is about 9/11.
And, I'll say a little bit more

00:02:08.583 --> 00:02:10.933
about that novel,
which I haven't read but I've

00:02:10.933 --> 00:02:13.946
read enough reviews of it to
know a few facts about it which

00:02:13.946 --> 00:02:15.990
I think are relevant to this
novel.

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.112
He said about itâ€¦he was
asked by an interviewer,

00:02:20.112 --> 00:02:24.770
"Well, doesn't it seem risky to
take on 9/11 as a subject?"

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.096
And he said,
"Well, what seems risky to me

00:02:28.096 --> 00:02:32.560
is not taking on the important
subjects of your time.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.069
That seems like the risk for a
writer."

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:40.067
And he says in another place,
"You have to justify the fact

00:02:40.067 --> 00:02:44.720
that you're sitting alone in a
room writing all day.

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:51.110
What you do has to be somehow
world changing."

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.216
So, for a
twenty-something-year-old

00:02:54.216 --> 00:02:58.981
writer, this is a heavy task.
And I think you can feel the

00:02:58.981 --> 00:03:03.684
heaviness of it in the novel,
partly in its formal ambition,

00:03:03.684 --> 00:03:07.430
and partly in the subjects that
it takes on.

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.751
It doesn't take on 9/11,
but it does take on the

00:03:10.751 --> 00:03:13.273
Holocaust.
So, I will have a whole

00:03:13.273 --> 00:03:17.640
argument about that aspect of
the novel and how it fits in to

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.259
literature of the post-45
period,

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:25.653
because--lucky you--I happen to
have written a book on this that

00:03:25.653 --> 00:03:29.729
came out in 2003,
about genocide in literature.

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:33.820
So, this is actually a perfect
novel for me to lecture on in

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.923
that respect.
When you first meet a novel

00:03:36.923 --> 00:03:39.187
of this kind,
with these ambitions,

00:03:39.187 --> 00:03:41.849
there are certain things that
you do,

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:46.875
and for me those things include
noticing just about everything I

00:03:46.875 --> 00:03:51.821
possibly can about the novel and
then thinking about what other

00:03:51.821 --> 00:03:55.970
things that I've read seem to be
speaking to it,

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:58.849
or it seems to be speaking to
those things.

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:02.233
Now, I promised that I would
not conduct this entire lecture

00:04:02.233 --> 00:04:05.444
in Q&amp;A, but I did not
promise that I wouldn't ask any

00:04:05.444 --> 00:04:09.444
questions, so here goes.
What novel seemed related to

00:04:09.444 --> 00:04:12.780
this novel, from our syllabus,
to you?

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.370
Well, you can go outside our
syllabus.

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.620
That's okay.
Did you have another idea?

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:18.606
Yes.Student:

00:04:19.446 --> 00:04:21.981
Hungerford: Yes.
That's certainly in dialog with

00:04:21.981 --> 00:04:24.997
this novel, yes,
and Foer talks about that as a

00:04:24.997 --> 00:04:27.750
novel that really was important
to him.

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.568
Okay.
What else?

00:04:29.568 --> 00:04:36.720
What from our syllabus seems to
be related to this novel?

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.190
You've never seen anything like
this before?

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:41.149
Yes.Student:
Lolita?

00:04:41.149 --> 00:04:42.420
Professor Amy Hungerford:
Lolita.

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:43.155
Why?
What in

00:04:46.097 --> 00:04:47.520
Amy Hungerford:
Okay.

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:52.810
Yes, some of that humor.
Yes. What else?

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:54.574
What else from our syllabus?
Yes.Student:

00:05:01.415 --> 00:05:02.404
character.
Professor Amy

00:05:02.404 --> 00:05:03.923
Hungerford: Yeah.
Absolutely yeah,

00:05:03.923 --> 00:05:07.029
inhabiting a voice that seems
very foreign.

00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:08.730
Yeah.
To the writer.

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:11.812
Yes. What else?
Yes.Student:

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:16.296
Yes.Professor Amy
Hungerford: And what was it

00:05:16.296 --> 00:05:18.942
about Barth that you think Foer
learned from?Student:

00:05:18.942 --> 00:05:21.139
I think kind of writing
about writing.

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:22.290
Professor Amy
Hungerford: Yes.

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:25.000
Yeah, absolutely.
Yep, definitely.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:33.310
What else?
Roth?

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:37.180
Did anyone not see Roth in this
novel?

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:41.589
Okay.
Roth is certainly here.

00:05:41.589 --> 00:05:46.259
Pynchon is very strongly here,
if you think about the episodes

00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:49.704
in Crying of Lot 49 with
the Paranoids,

00:05:49.704 --> 00:05:52.920
all those funny jokes and their
songs.

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:58.217
Foer learned a lot from
Pynchon, and certainly even more

00:05:58.217 --> 00:06:02.970
from Pynchon's other novel,
Gravity's Rainbow,

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:07.029
I think, particularly,
than from Crying of Lot 49,

00:06:07.029 --> 00:06:08.956
which doesn't--because of
its length-- doesn't quite go to

00:06:08.956 --> 00:06:12.136
the operatic,
playful lengths that a longer

00:06:12.136 --> 00:06:16.644
Pynchon novel can go to.
Pynchon is also very interested

00:06:16.644 --> 00:06:20.082
in the eighteenth century,
and so that interest is

00:06:20.082 --> 00:06:23.240
something that Foer shares,
in this novel.

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:28.317
Foer is someone who learned a
lot from the group of writers

00:06:28.317 --> 00:06:32.694
that we would call
"postmodernist" and that I would

00:06:32.694 --> 00:06:36.492
call "late modernist."
He learned to be very

00:06:36.492 --> 00:06:40.043
self-conscious about his
language and to make that

00:06:40.043 --> 00:06:42.870
evident on the surface of the
novel.

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:47.089
He also learned,
though, from Toni Morrison.

00:06:47.089 --> 00:06:50.639
(Come on in.) He learned from
Toni Morrison.

00:06:50.639 --> 00:06:55.933
In particular,
I think, he learned the value

00:06:55.933 --> 00:07:01.640
of time travel in a novel.
This was something that I

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:04.806
brought up with respect to
Edward P.

00:07:04.806 --> 00:07:08.333
Jones, as well,
but it's certainly here,

00:07:08.333 --> 00:07:12.403
and there is one very,
very clear reference to

00:07:12.403 --> 00:07:16.065
Morrison.
This is on page 51,

00:07:16.065 --> 00:07:22.597
when he's talking about the
name of the shtetl and how it

00:07:22.597 --> 00:07:27.424
was called.
Now, my Ukrainian is not very

00:07:27.424 --> 00:07:31.829
"premium," so I will butcher
this name.

00:07:31.829 --> 00:07:40.149
"Of course no one in Sofiowka
called it Sofiowka.

00:07:40.149 --> 00:07:43.385
Until it had such a
disagreeable official name,

00:07:43.385 --> 00:07:46.410
no one felt the need to call it
anything,

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:49.411
but now that there was an
offense that the shtetl should

00:07:49.411 --> 00:07:51.430
be called that shithead's
namesake,

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:55.180
the citizens had a name not to
go by.

00:07:55.180 --> 00:08:00.874
Some even called the shtetl Not
Sofiowka and would continue to

00:08:00.874 --> 00:08:05.729
even after the new name was
chosen."In Song of

00:08:05.729 --> 00:08:08.802
Solomon,
written in 1979,

00:08:08.802 --> 00:08:14.563
I think, Toni Morrison has a
street that's called Not Doctor

00:08:14.563 --> 00:08:17.636
Street,
because it was given an

00:08:17.636 --> 00:08:23.379
official name at odds with what
the black community called it.

00:08:23.379 --> 00:08:27.089
And so, they had called it
Doctor Street.

00:08:27.089 --> 00:08:28.786
The town christened it
something else,

00:08:28.786 --> 00:08:31.032
I think Main Street or
something, and so then they

00:08:31.032 --> 00:08:33.468
called it Not Doctor Street.
So this little,

00:08:33.468 --> 00:08:36.440
teeny piece is lifted directly
from Morrison.

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:39.299
You can see her footprints on
here in that sense.

00:08:39.299 --> 00:08:42.349
Toni Morrison was,
of course, a teacher at

00:08:42.349 --> 00:08:46.423
Princeton when Foer was there.
I don't know if he took courses

00:08:46.423 --> 00:08:48.868
with her.
He certainly studied with Joyce

00:08:48.868 --> 00:08:52.542
Carol Oates, but Morrison was
around and I'm sure he has read

00:08:52.542 --> 00:08:55.123
that novel.
It would be surprising to me if

00:08:55.123 --> 00:08:58.059
he has not.
So, the other thing that he

00:08:58.059 --> 00:09:02.850
takes from Morrison is that
sense of collective history,

00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:08.379
that history is something
passed down in oral tradition in

00:09:08.379 --> 00:09:14.185
an intensely verbal culture.
So, the Jewish shtetl culture

00:09:14.185 --> 00:09:18.878
that Foer imagines,
and the black community that

00:09:18.878 --> 00:09:23.172
Morrison imagines,
are both intensely verbal

00:09:23.172 --> 00:09:26.683
cultures.
Now, the Jewish community of

00:09:26.683 --> 00:09:30.834
Foer's novel is also intensely
literary, in the sense of

00:09:30.834 --> 00:09:34.832
literate.
They write everything down,

00:09:34.832 --> 00:09:40.904
also, so that's a slight
difference between Morrison's

00:09:40.904 --> 00:09:45.021
vision and Foer's.
I want to go in to some

00:09:45.021 --> 00:09:48.316
detail about what I think Foer
has learned from Roth,

00:09:48.316 --> 00:09:51.866
because Roth is the person I
see most strongly behind his

00:09:51.866 --> 00:09:54.561
writing.
We didn't see the playful,

00:09:54.561 --> 00:09:58.879
metafictional side of Roth very
much in The Human Stain.

00:09:58.879 --> 00:10:03.536
Roth's work is straddling
both sides of that line,

00:10:03.536 --> 00:10:07.929
between realism and very
hyper-metafictionality.

00:10:07.929 --> 00:10:10.850
So, some of his novels have
alternate endings.

00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:15.230
He has several novels that
feature Philip Roth.

00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:22.200
So, Foer takes the conceit of
naming a character after himself

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:27.124
directly from Roth.
So, there are ways that he is,

00:10:27.124 --> 00:10:29.396
on the surface,
citing Roth,

00:10:29.396 --> 00:10:34.446
but there is a more profound
way that he is working in Roth's

00:10:34.446 --> 00:10:37.491
terrain,
and that is in the terrain of

00:10:37.491 --> 00:10:40.711
desire.
So, thinking back to Roth's

00:10:40.711 --> 00:10:45.875
first novel, Portnoy's
Complaint, which is all

00:10:45.875 --> 00:10:50.359
about masturbation,
Alex Portnoy's masturbation,

00:10:50.359 --> 00:10:55.039
we see that he's taken the name
Alex, Alexander Portnoy.

00:10:55.039 --> 00:11:00.544
Alex appears in this novel as
well, and then we have Safran,

00:11:00.544 --> 00:11:03.809
who is this sort of love
machine.

00:11:03.809 --> 00:11:09.810
So, he is a double of Alex
Portnoy, with a difference,

00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:13.693
though;
so, instead of masturbation,

00:11:13.693 --> 00:11:17.375
it's sex with the needy,
essentially,

00:11:17.375 --> 00:11:22.181
sex with the love starved,
virgins, older women,

00:11:22.181 --> 00:11:25.914
widows, etc.
So, the immediate

00:11:25.914 --> 00:11:31.710
difference that Foer is pointing
to, is the difference between

00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:35.700
something like solipsism or
narcissism,

00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:43.413
desire as the fuel for that
narcissism, versus desire as the

00:11:43.413 --> 00:11:48.120
fuel for community and
connection.

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:52.330
This is not without trouble,
though.

00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:54.969
And it's the trouble that
interests me,

00:11:54.969 --> 00:11:58.441
and that I think he takes from
Roth: and that's the

00:11:58.441 --> 00:12:02.470
impossibility of ever actually
making that connection,

00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:09.047
of it ever finally coming home.
And you see that in the story

00:12:09.047 --> 00:12:13.650
of Safran, just in the fact
that--by the time he finally

00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:17.301
gets married,
and finally has a proper

00:12:17.301 --> 00:12:22.309
orgasm--what he falls in love
with, at that moment,

00:12:22.309 --> 00:12:26.131
is not his wife,
but the baby that he is

00:12:26.131 --> 00:12:31.716
engendering in that moment (and
of course it's a baby that

00:12:31.716 --> 00:12:36.995
doesn't even exist yet).
So, the very absence at the

00:12:36.995 --> 00:12:40.375
heart of desire,
the blankness or the

00:12:40.375 --> 00:12:44.413
impossibility,
is demonstrated even in those

00:12:44.413 --> 00:12:48.169
moments of overwhelming
connection.

00:12:48.169 --> 00:12:56.115
And, I think it's telling
that Foer imagines sexual energy

00:12:56.115 --> 00:13:03.149
as light, rather than some other
kind of phenomenon.

00:13:03.149 --> 00:13:04.950
So, "Everything is
Illuminated";

00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:07.983
remember,
there is that image of the

00:13:07.983 --> 00:13:12.416
world being lit up by people
making love, that it actually

00:13:12.416 --> 00:13:16.149
generates light that you can see
from space.

00:13:16.149 --> 00:13:22.960
It's not a concrete engendering
act, even when it is.

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:28.237
It creates something else,
and that something else seems

00:13:28.237 --> 00:13:34.110
to be related to knowledge;
how can you know your past?

00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:38.260
This is a problem in the novel,
and it's a feature of the quest

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:41.790
element.
And I'll say more about that in

00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:47.512
my second lecture on the novel,
but I think it has to do with a

00:13:47.512 --> 00:13:52.956
vague understanding that is
imagined to illuminate the world

00:13:52.956 --> 00:13:56.740
as a result of desire's
fulfillment,

00:13:56.740 --> 00:14:03.036
or almost fulfillment.
But that theme of sex and

00:14:03.036 --> 00:14:09.139
desire is abstracted into lots
of other forms.

00:14:09.139 --> 00:14:13.876
And the couple that I want to
look at--one is sort of

00:14:13.876 --> 00:14:15.820
religious.
This is on 140.

00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:25.355
Here, we're learning about the
veneration of Brod's husband,

00:14:25.355 --> 00:14:31.828
the Kolker, who is then bronzed
and made into a statue in the

00:14:31.828 --> 00:14:36.412
town after he dies,
still with the saw blade

00:14:36.412 --> 00:14:39.610
embedded in his head.
This is at the bottom of 140.

00:14:43.399 --> 00:14:47.353
Those who prayed came to
believe less and less in the god

00:14:47.353 --> 00:14:50.158
of their creation,
and more and more in their

00:14:50.158 --> 00:14:52.520
belief.
The unmarried women kissed the

00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:55.841
Dial's battered lips although
they were not faithful to their

00:14:55.841 --> 00:14:59.710
god, but to the kiss.
They were kissing themselves.

00:14:59.710 --> 00:15:02.616
And when the bridegrooms knelt,
it was not the god they

00:15:02.616 --> 00:15:04.840
believed in.
It was the kneel,

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:09.078
not the god's bronzed knees,
but their own bruised

00:15:09.078 --> 00:15:12.101
ones.
This little moment of

00:15:12.101 --> 00:15:17.190
reflection on religious ritual,
or quasi-religious ritual,

00:15:17.190 --> 00:15:21.480
is related to some things that
I want to say about the role of

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:25.235
Judaism in my next lecture.
But, as a practice,

00:15:25.235 --> 00:15:29.841
it is a practice of negativity,
of acknowledging the

00:15:29.841 --> 00:15:35.259
impossibility of connection to
that god and the impossibility

00:15:35.259 --> 00:15:40.425
of fulfillment from that god.
But, nevertheless,

00:15:40.425 --> 00:15:46.246
it is committed to the
fulfillment of the effort to

00:15:46.246 --> 00:15:52.049
make that connection.
So, it's belief in belief.

00:15:52.049 --> 00:15:55.366
And, in fact,
the book that I'm writing right

00:15:55.366 --> 00:15:58.080
now is all about belief in
belief,

00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:02.208
and so this confirms my sense
that this is an important way of

00:16:02.208 --> 00:16:05.659
imagining how belief works in
the current moment.

00:16:05.659 --> 00:16:10.830
You believe in the act of
belief.

00:16:10.830 --> 00:16:13.029
So, that's one kind of
negativity.

00:16:13.029 --> 00:16:16.641
Then there is a visual image
that we get over and over again,

00:16:16.641 --> 00:16:19.110
and that's of the hole,
the empty hole.

00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:25.940
There are a couple of examples
here, on 135.

00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:30.559
This is after Brod and the
Kolker have separated themselves

00:16:30.559 --> 00:16:34.860
with a wall because the Kolker
keeps beating her up.

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:39.099
He's deranged in part--part
sane, part deranged--by his

00:16:39.099 --> 00:16:43.757
saw-blade embedded in his head.
And so they have this hole

00:16:43.757 --> 00:16:47.494
between them through which they
can communicate,

00:16:47.494 --> 00:16:52.343
but the wall protects Brod from
his rages so he won't beat her

00:16:52.343 --> 00:16:54.562
up.
They lived [This is on

00:16:54.562 --> 00:16:56.370
135.]
They lived with the hole.

00:16:56.370 --> 00:17:01.010
The absence that defined it
became a presence that defined

00:17:01.010 --> 00:17:04.325
them.
Life was a small negative space

00:17:04.325 --> 00:17:09.817
cut out of the eternal solidity,
and for the first time it felt

00:17:09.817 --> 00:17:12.855
precious,
not like all of the words that

00:17:12.855 --> 00:17:16.344
had come to mean nothing but
like the last breath of a

00:17:16.344 --> 00:17:19.430
drowning victim.
So, here we're offered two

00:17:19.430 --> 00:17:23.013
versions of negativity.
One is all of the words that

00:17:23.013 --> 00:17:27.439
had come to mean nothing,
and the other is this physical

00:17:27.439 --> 00:17:32.336
emptiness, the hole.
So, the words that mean nothing

00:17:32.336 --> 00:17:37.250
are an emptiness that is
frustrating, a blockage,

00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:42.438
but the emptiness that is the
space, the visual space,

00:17:42.438 --> 00:17:46.059
comes to be a space of
imagination,

00:17:46.059 --> 00:17:49.180
that gets filled with
imagination.

00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:53.394
So, they see each other from a
distance for the first time,

00:17:53.394 --> 00:17:57.246
and are overwhelmed by the
connection that can then be

00:17:57.246 --> 00:18:01.611
formed between them.
So, it's the very absence of

00:18:01.611 --> 00:18:05.825
the physical presence,
one's distance from it,

00:18:05.825 --> 00:18:10.319
that becomes the fulfillment
for this couple.

00:18:10.319 --> 00:18:13.322
So, I hope you can see the
structural similarity,

00:18:13.322 --> 00:18:16.950
or the logical similarity,
between believing and belief.

00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:22.131
And we're told of Brod,
remember, also,

00:18:22.131 --> 00:18:29.630
on page 83, that she was
constitutionally unable to love

00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:31.130
anyone.

00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:38.806
This is at the top of 83.
When she said,

00:18:38.806 --> 00:18:41.756
"Father, I love you," she was
neither naïve nor

00:18:41.756 --> 00:18:45.937
dishonest, but the opposite.
She was wise and truthful

00:18:45.937 --> 00:18:49.579
enough to lie.
They reciprocated the great and

00:18:49.579 --> 00:18:53.785
saving lie that our love for
things is greater than our love

00:18:53.785 --> 00:18:57.719
for our love for things,
willfully playing the parts

00:18:57.719 --> 00:19:01.291
they wrote for themselves,
willfully creating and

00:19:01.291 --> 00:19:04.789
believing fictions necessary for
life.

00:19:04.789 --> 00:19:07.601
So, if this is the lie,
that our love for things is

00:19:07.601 --> 00:19:10.299
greater than our love for our
love for things,

00:19:10.299 --> 00:19:15.485
the truth is that our love for
our love is greater than our

00:19:15.485 --> 00:19:19.329
love for actual things or actual
persons.

00:19:19.329 --> 00:19:24.339
It's the same structure as the
belief in belief.

00:19:24.339 --> 00:19:29.313
Of course, that story of Brod
and her father telling each

00:19:29.313 --> 00:19:34.109
other stories--both about their
love for each other,

00:19:34.109 --> 00:19:38.238
and, in her father's case,
Yankel's case,

00:19:38.238 --> 00:19:42.470
about her mother,
her fictional mother,

00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:48.290
who he says died before she was
old enough to remember her--all

00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:54.016
of the stories that Yankel makes
up become the fullness of his

00:19:54.016 --> 00:19:58.527
life with Brod.
So, they replace the loss of

00:19:58.527 --> 00:20:01.839
his first wife who abandoned
him.

00:20:01.839 --> 00:20:08.553
And so, this gives fiction
a very powerful brief in the

00:20:08.553 --> 00:20:10.996
world.
This is not unlike the

00:20:10.996 --> 00:20:15.200
structure that I was pointing
out in The Human Stain,

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:20.400
 where the blankness of
Coleman and Faunia allows Nathan

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:25.433
to re-inhabit life by imagining
onto them all the dynamics of

00:20:25.433 --> 00:20:29.632
their desire,
all of the facts of their life,

00:20:29.632 --> 00:20:33.119
all of the details of their
biography.

00:20:33.119 --> 00:20:38.067
So, likewise,
Foer uses blankness as a way of

00:20:38.067 --> 00:20:44.610
pumping up the power of fiction.
It plays this role despite the

00:20:44.610 --> 00:20:49.779
threat it will always pose to
fiction that you get here,

00:20:49.779 --> 00:20:55.847
or on that little passage I
just quoted before,

00:20:55.847 --> 00:21:03.106
about the nothingness of words.
So, the nothingness that gives

00:21:03.106 --> 00:21:08.629
fiction its blank space to
inhabit, also can seep into and

00:21:08.629 --> 00:21:13.182
infect words as in the
repetition of a word like

00:21:13.182 --> 00:21:17.252
"Malkovich."
It is an infection that

00:21:17.252 --> 00:21:20.940
bothered critics about this
novel.

00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:26.691
They felt that the postmodern
play of the novel was

00:21:26.691 --> 00:21:32.558
essentially trivial,
because these kinds of play had

00:21:32.558 --> 00:21:37.390
been conducted in novels thirty
years,

00:21:37.390 --> 00:21:41.546
forty years before (and many
more than that if you count

00:21:41.546 --> 00:21:45.400
Tristram Shandy in the
eighteenth century,

00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:50.220
but took powerful hold in
American fiction in the '60s).

00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:55.912
They felt that Foer was simply
taking out those tools and

00:21:55.912 --> 00:22:00.791
deploying them again,
but not for any new sort of

00:22:00.791 --> 00:22:03.697
payoff.
So, some critics were

00:22:03.697 --> 00:22:07.325
frustrated with this.
Now, this brings me to a

00:22:07.325 --> 00:22:10.772
second kind of context that I
would bring to this novel,

00:22:10.772 --> 00:22:13.970
or I do bring to this novel as
I think about it.

00:22:13.970 --> 00:22:18.891
In 2001, Jonathan Franzen's
novel The Corrections won

00:22:18.891 --> 00:22:23.155
the National Book Award.
The Corrections

00:22:23.155 --> 00:22:30.490
attempted to make a marriage
between the postmodern novel,

00:22:30.490 --> 00:22:35.579
as he understood it,
the novel filled with those

00:22:35.579 --> 00:22:40.500
kinds of verbal play.
And Franzen modeled his novel

00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:44.188
on William Gaddis' novel The
Recognitions,

00:22:44.188 --> 00:22:47.289
which is about an art
forgery.

00:22:47.289 --> 00:22:53.440
It's about 900 pages of
incredibly experimental prose.

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:59.238
It's extremely hard to read.
But for Franzen that novel had

00:22:59.238 --> 00:23:04.061
enough in it of character
development and human investment

00:23:04.061 --> 00:23:08.716
to go along with its verbal
playfulness that it made him

00:23:08.716 --> 00:23:13.875
want to keep reading it.
So, in homage to that novel,

00:23:13.875 --> 00:23:19.091
he called his novel The
Corrections and tried to

00:23:19.091 --> 00:23:24.501
give us a story where the verbal
play would not drain the

00:23:24.501 --> 00:23:29.671
sentiment from the novel.
So, he described it as the

00:23:29.671 --> 00:23:34.039
social novel coming to meet the
postmodern novel.

00:23:34.039 --> 00:23:38.028
He announced this to great
fanfare in an essay,

00:23:38.028 --> 00:23:41.930
and of course the novel then
became famous.

00:23:41.930 --> 00:23:44.476
And he became
infamous when he was

00:23:44.476 --> 00:23:47.601
invited by Oprah to go on
Oprah's Book Club with The

00:23:47.601 --> 00:23:50.089
Corrections, and he
refused.

00:23:50.089 --> 00:23:54.769
It was quite a scandal in the
literary world.

00:23:54.769 --> 00:23:57.690
And then he tried to go back on
it and say, "Oh,

00:23:57.690 --> 00:24:00.710
okay, Oprah.
I really wasn't being a snob.

00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:02.990
I'll come on your show," but
then she said "No.

00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:06.648
Sorry.
We're scheduled for that week

00:24:06.648 --> 00:24:09.296
now."
It was really a mistake on

00:24:09.296 --> 00:24:12.466
Franzen's part,
but it also demonstrated his

00:24:12.466 --> 00:24:16.520
own ambivalence about the very
project he had set out to

00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:19.271
accomplish,
which is to make a novel that

00:24:19.271 --> 00:24:22.090
people really want to read,
that has some sentimental

00:24:22.090 --> 00:24:25.092
purchase on you,
that has characters you could

00:24:25.092 --> 00:24:29.310
care about, as well as being
extremely ambitious in this way,

00:24:29.310 --> 00:24:32.331
in this formal way.
Now that novel,

00:24:32.331 --> 00:24:36.212
the way it tried to get
sentiment and verbal play to

00:24:36.212 --> 00:24:39.398
line up,
was in part by making one of

00:24:39.398 --> 00:24:43.339
the central characters an
Alzheimer's patient.

00:24:43.339 --> 00:24:47.110
So, it's about a family,
a midwestern family,

00:24:47.110 --> 00:24:52.079
and the two parents get
extended treatment in the novel,

00:24:52.079 --> 00:24:54.587
as do the three children,
grown children,

00:24:54.587 --> 00:24:58.224
in the family.
And the father has Alzheimer's,

00:24:58.224 --> 00:25:01.710
and so there's a very
Pynchon-esque scene,

00:25:01.710 --> 00:25:04.934
when his,
actually, his shit starts

00:25:04.934 --> 00:25:08.903
talking to him,
and this is taken right out of

00:25:08.903 --> 00:25:12.456
Gravity's Rainbow.
There's a scene very

00:25:12.456 --> 00:25:14.910
similar to this in Gravity's
Rainbow.

00:25:14.910 --> 00:25:20.867
So, Franzen tried to
make that poignant by making it

00:25:20.867 --> 00:25:25.309
something that the modernists
tried to do,

00:25:25.309 --> 00:25:30.345
which is the representation of
the actual workings of the human

00:25:30.345 --> 00:25:34.221
mind in a daily situation.
And the terror of it,

00:25:34.221 --> 00:25:37.654
for that character,
I thought, when I read the

00:25:37.654 --> 00:25:40.630
novel, came across quite
powerfully.

00:25:40.630 --> 00:25:48.017
So, for me, in part, it worked.
Foer is doing something that is

00:25:48.017 --> 00:25:52.532
related.
He is trying to have both

00:25:52.532 --> 00:26:00.357
sentiment and formal play.
How many of you felt for these

00:26:00.357 --> 00:26:04.250
characters?
How many of you felt that they

00:26:04.250 --> 00:26:08.849
were really inaccessible to you,
flat, unemotionally interesting

00:26:08.849 --> 00:26:10.680
to you?
Okay. Just one.

00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:15.353
So, I think he succeeded,
probably, to a greater degree,

00:26:15.353 --> 00:26:19.856
if you read the critics (and
you can read that in this

00:26:19.856 --> 00:26:24.785
incredibly bulked-up blurb
section in the packaging of this

00:26:24.785 --> 00:26:28.171
novel).
A lot of critics did really

00:26:28.171 --> 00:26:31.466
like this novel,
and I think that's why,

00:26:31.466 --> 00:26:34.930
that for most readers,
he did succeed.

00:26:34.930 --> 00:26:39.539
Now, I have things to say about
that, but in a minute.

00:26:39.539 --> 00:26:43.355
I want to say that there is
another kind of context that I

00:26:43.355 --> 00:26:45.920
think you could attend to
productively,

00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:52.369
and that is the quality of this
novel as a campus novel.

00:26:52.369 --> 00:26:56.188
Now, that's probably not
exactly what you were thinking

00:26:56.188 --> 00:27:00.854
of when you read this novel.
It's a campus novel because it

00:27:00.854 --> 00:27:05.265
was written on a campus,
and it's also a campus novel

00:27:05.265 --> 00:27:10.354
because it is in part a coming
of age novel about someone who

00:27:10.354 --> 00:27:15.274
goes from needing a lot of help
with his writing to kind of

00:27:15.274 --> 00:27:19.341
writing on his own.
So, what you see is the

00:27:19.341 --> 00:27:24.116
displacement of a narrative that
looks very much like Foer's

00:27:24.116 --> 00:27:27.046
development,
or you would imagine the

00:27:27.046 --> 00:27:31.050
development of a writer in a
writing program at Princeton

00:27:31.050 --> 00:27:35.014
over time,
at first needing suggestions

00:27:35.014 --> 00:27:38.670
from a mentor.
And, a lot of the way that we

00:27:38.670 --> 00:27:42.380
come to know the character
Jonathan Safran Foer in the

00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:45.020
beginning,
through Alex's letters,

00:27:45.020 --> 00:27:49.383
has to do with things that he
has said to Alex about how to

00:27:49.383 --> 00:27:52.269
write,
suggestions he's made.

00:27:52.269 --> 00:27:57.743
So, Jonathan Safran Foer
remains as a sort of shadowy

00:27:57.743 --> 00:28:04.269
presence for much of this novel,
but we see his wise sayings to

00:28:04.269 --> 00:28:08.440
Alex about writing.
It's an interesting

00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:12.930
inversion of the situation that
the author was in fact in.

00:28:12.930 --> 00:28:16.183
He was in the class,
taking the class,

00:28:16.183 --> 00:28:21.019
not teaching the class,
when he was an undergraduate,

00:28:21.019 --> 00:28:22.844
and this was written when he
wasâ€¦I think it was

00:28:22.844 --> 00:28:24.050
published when he was twenty
one.

00:28:24.050 --> 00:28:27.750
The bar is not high.
Don't worry.

00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:30.300
No. I'm just kidding.
The bar is very high.

00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:33.286
Let me say that.
The bar is very high,

00:28:33.286 --> 00:28:35.950
but don't worry.
Life is long.

00:28:35.950 --> 00:28:36.790
You have plenty of time.

00:28:41.049 --> 00:28:45.145
This is not just about Jonathan
Safran Foer, the man,

00:28:45.145 --> 00:28:49.950
and his particular biography of
being a student in the writing

00:28:49.950 --> 00:28:53.054
program at Princeton.
It is also about an

00:28:53.054 --> 00:28:56.456
institutional history of writing
in the second half of the

00:28:56.456 --> 00:28:58.682
twentieth century.
If you remember,

00:28:58.682 --> 00:29:01.173
way back when,
when I lectured on Flannery

00:29:01.173 --> 00:29:04.941
O'Connor, I mentioned to you a
critic named Mark McGurl at UCLA

00:29:04.941 --> 00:29:08.466
who is writing a book called
The Program Era (or has

00:29:08.466 --> 00:29:11.353
written it,
and I think it should be out

00:29:11.353 --> 00:29:15.196
very soon, called The Program
Era). And it's an

00:29:15.196 --> 00:29:19.232
analysis of how writing programs
leave their mark on the fiction

00:29:19.232 --> 00:29:23.219
of the last fifty years,
because what's particularly

00:29:23.219 --> 00:29:28.029
striking and new about writing
in this period is that a lot of

00:29:28.029 --> 00:29:32.591
it happens on campuses,
and a lot of authors are

00:29:32.591 --> 00:29:36.253
writing for campus
audiences.So,

00:29:36.253 --> 00:29:41.799
Foer's novel is a version of
that kind of fiction,

00:29:41.799 --> 00:29:45.410
and we can read it that way,
I think, quite easily.

00:29:45.410 --> 00:29:49.087
It fits in that story that Mark
McGurl tells about the

00:29:49.087 --> 00:29:53.034
development of this period.
So, just as when I read it,

00:29:53.034 --> 00:29:57.116
I see that notation about
belief in belief and the love of

00:29:57.116 --> 00:29:59.553
love,
and it fits in to a story that

00:29:59.553 --> 00:30:03.218
I'm telling about the evolution
of religion in literature in

00:30:03.218 --> 00:30:06.113
this period,
so you can ally it to other

00:30:06.113 --> 00:30:09.385
arguments that are made about
the period, too,

00:30:09.385 --> 00:30:13.602
and that help you to see why
certain things might be in the

00:30:13.602 --> 00:30:17.019
novel and what kind of work they
do there.

00:30:17.019 --> 00:30:21.404
And finally,
there is a last context that I

00:30:21.404 --> 00:30:24.940
saw pointed out.
I think it was in the review in

00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:28.464
The Nation, and
that's of trips of Americans to

00:30:28.464 --> 00:30:31.460
post-communist Europe and
post-communist Russia.

00:30:32.539 --> 00:30:35.604
Apparently, there is a whole
spate of novels that came out

00:30:35.604 --> 00:30:38.401
right about the same time,
where Americans,

00:30:38.401 --> 00:30:42.677
almost invariably young men,
went to the former Soviet

00:30:42.677 --> 00:30:46.470
republics and had coming-of-age
experiences.

00:30:46.470 --> 00:30:49.410
So, this certainly fits that
genre.

00:30:49.410 --> 00:30:52.180
I don't personally have a lot
to say about that.

00:30:52.180 --> 00:30:55.287
I think it's interesting to see
it as being aligned with a group

00:30:55.287 --> 00:30:57.887
of novels that do that.
It doesn't, for me,

00:30:57.887 --> 00:31:02.134
provide any particular insight,
but that's not because it's-

00:31:02.134 --> 00:31:05.584
because it wouldn't.
It just happens that that

00:31:05.584 --> 00:31:09.818
didn't strike a chord with me,
or lead me to other points of

00:31:09.818 --> 00:31:13.131
analysis.
This is another point that I

00:31:13.131 --> 00:31:18.210
want you to take away from my
engagement with this novel.

00:31:18.210 --> 00:31:22.916
That is, that no matter what
context can be brought to it,

00:31:22.916 --> 00:31:26.880
you as a reader bring your own
particular one,

00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:30.565
your own particular set of
knowledge, your own particular

00:31:30.565 --> 00:31:33.000
training, your own life
experience.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:36.668
So, we're getting to the
end of the course,

00:31:36.668 --> 00:31:40.256
and, in a way,
you have now the opportunity to

00:31:40.256 --> 00:31:44.749
approach these novels,
any new novel that's written,

00:31:44.749 --> 00:31:49.839
with several kinds of stories
about the period in your mind,

00:31:49.839 --> 00:31:54.389
because now you have read--I
hope you have read--many novels

00:31:54.389 --> 00:31:57.491
in this period,
and you can see where the

00:31:57.491 --> 00:32:00.703
connections are.
So, you're starting to draw

00:32:00.703 --> 00:32:03.117
those.
You'll need to do that on the

00:32:03.117 --> 00:32:07.042
exam, but far more importantly,
I hope that you will continue

00:32:07.042 --> 00:32:10.640
to do it when you read on your
own outside of class.

00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:14.329
A lot of you are seniors.
You may not have a lot of time

00:32:14.329 --> 00:32:17.410
after you leave school to read
novels.

00:32:17.410 --> 00:32:20.838
When you do,
I hope it will be part of your

00:32:20.838 --> 00:32:25.410
pleasure to approach them with a
sense of empowerment,

00:32:25.410 --> 00:32:29.899
that you can know where they
fit in the history of the art

00:32:29.899 --> 00:32:33.632
form they're engaging,
apart from your own pleasure in

00:32:33.632 --> 00:32:35.949
reading them,
which will I'm sure be the

00:32:35.949 --> 00:32:38.980
primary reason you'd pick up a
novel to read it,

00:32:38.980 --> 00:32:42.549
but there is that other
intellectual pleasure that you

00:32:42.549 --> 00:32:45.776
now can have.
I want to encourage you to feel

00:32:45.776 --> 00:32:50.005
that you can do that.
It doesn't mean that it will

00:32:50.005 --> 00:32:54.942
always produce insight for you.
So, I have been thinking about

00:32:54.942 --> 00:32:57.480
this novel for approximately two
weeks.

00:32:57.480 --> 00:33:01.422
Most novels that I lecture to
you about, I have been thinking

00:33:01.422 --> 00:33:06.409
about for at least two years.
Your insights over time change,

00:33:06.409 --> 00:33:09.549
and you notice different
things.

00:33:09.549 --> 00:33:13.700
And it's nice to allow time for
that, and that's the value of

00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:17.920
rereading in a few years what
you read before as a student.

00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:20.333
So, I hope you'll maybe return
to some of these novels,

00:33:20.333 --> 00:33:22.853
as well.
Now, that was my little

00:33:22.853 --> 00:33:27.613
digression about after-college
reading, or outside-of-the-class

00:33:27.613 --> 00:33:32.220
reading, but let me return to
this question of sentiment.

00:33:32.220 --> 00:33:37.303
Foer wants it both ways,
and one of the ways he has it

00:33:37.303 --> 00:33:43.441
both ways is by internalizing in
the novel a reader figure who is

00:33:43.441 --> 00:33:47.683
our double.
There are actually three

00:33:47.683 --> 00:33:50.720
doubles for us,
at least.

00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:54.788
One is Alex,
who is reading Jonathan's story

00:33:54.788 --> 00:33:59.381
as he sends it to him.
Embedding a critical reader

00:33:59.381 --> 00:34:03.421
within the novel,
as we have seen with Barth and

00:34:03.421 --> 00:34:07.289
in Pynchon (where Oedipa was
that double),

00:34:07.289 --> 00:34:12.349
allows a certain set of
metafictional tricks.

00:34:12.349 --> 00:34:17.772
One of the most reliable
functions for that internalized

00:34:17.772 --> 00:34:22.848
reader is to cue you,
me, the actual human readers,

00:34:22.848 --> 00:34:28.271
to notice or feel certain
things, or (if you are Nabokov)

00:34:28.271 --> 00:34:33.555
to be misled in certain ways.
Think of the prologue from John

00:34:33.555 --> 00:34:36.409
Ray Jr.
which misleads us in reading

00:34:36.409 --> 00:34:38.579
that novel.
He's our double,

00:34:38.579 --> 00:34:42.956
but he's there to trick us.
I don't think that Alex is here

00:34:42.956 --> 00:34:50.059
to trick us.
And, just to note how he cues

00:34:50.059 --> 00:34:58.406
us, let's look on 142 and 3.
This is one of the letters

00:34:58.406 --> 00:35:03.412
where Alex is less busy with
self-presentation by this point

00:35:03.412 --> 00:35:07.045
in the novel,
and he is really responding to

00:35:07.045 --> 00:35:09.170
what Jonathan has sent him.

00:35:13.590 --> 00:35:16.772
This is in the middle of 143.
Those things that you

00:35:16.772 --> 00:35:19.953
wrote in your letter about your
grandmother made me remember how

00:35:19.953 --> 00:35:23.082
you told me on Augustine's steps
about when you would sit under

00:35:23.082 --> 00:35:26.097
her dress,
and how that presented you

00:35:26.097 --> 00:35:29.822
safety and peace.
I must confess that I became

00:35:29.822 --> 00:35:32.989
melancholy then and still am
melancholy.

00:35:32.989 --> 00:35:36.262
I was also very moved--is this
how you use it?--by what you

00:35:36.262 --> 00:35:39.195
wrote about how impossible it
must have been for your

00:35:39.195 --> 00:35:41.960
grandmother to be a mother
without a husband.

00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:44.607
It is amazing,
yes, how your grandfather

00:35:44.607 --> 00:35:48.340
survived so much only to die
when he came to America.

00:35:48.340 --> 00:35:51.229
It is as if,
after surviving so much,

00:35:51.229 --> 00:35:54.599
there was no longer a reason to
survive.

00:35:54.599 --> 00:35:57.406
When you wrote about the early
death of your grandfather,

00:35:57.406 --> 00:36:00.464
it helped me to understand in
some manners the melancholy that

00:36:00.464 --> 00:36:02.869
Grandfather has felt since
Grandmother died,

00:36:02.869 --> 00:36:05.590
and not only because they both
died from cancer.

00:36:05.590 --> 00:36:08.912
I do not know your mother of
course, but I know you and I can

00:36:08.912 --> 00:36:12.289
tell you that your grandfather
would have been so so proud.

00:36:12.289 --> 00:36:16.599
It is my hope that I will be a
person that Grandmother would

00:36:16.599 --> 00:36:21.456
have been so so proud of.
We're being cued to be moved,

00:36:21.456 --> 00:36:25.760
to be moved by the story in
these particular ways,

00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:31.936
to take his reflections on his
grandmother, which are indeed

00:36:31.936 --> 00:36:36.019
very lovely, and to be moved by
them.

00:36:36.019 --> 00:36:43.573
But one reservation I guess I
have about the success of this

00:36:43.573 --> 00:36:48.309
move is just its boldness,
I guess.

00:36:48.309 --> 00:36:54.369
I'm being told that I should be
moved by these passages.

00:36:54.369 --> 00:37:03.398
There are also moments when we
get reflections that seem like

00:37:03.398 --> 00:37:11.974
they would never stand if they
were not embedded in Alex's

00:37:11.974 --> 00:37:19.470
voice, and this is on 68-69.
This is Alex talking about how

00:37:19.470 --> 00:37:22.776
he came upon Little Igor,
his brother,

00:37:22.776 --> 00:37:23.670
crying.

00:37:30.110 --> 00:37:32.280
I knew why he was a
little less than crying.

00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:36.028
I knew very well and I wanted
to go to him and tell him that I

00:37:36.028 --> 00:37:38.179
had a little less than cried
too,

00:37:38.179 --> 00:37:40.584
just like him,
and that no matter how much it

00:37:40.584 --> 00:37:43.917
seemed like he would never grow
up to be a premium person like

00:37:43.917 --> 00:37:46.129
me,
with many girls and so many

00:37:46.129 --> 00:37:48.230
famous places to go,
he would.

00:37:48.230 --> 00:37:50.870
He would be exactly like me,
and look at me,

00:37:50.870 --> 00:37:53.218
Little Igor.
The bruises go away,

00:37:53.218 --> 00:37:57.162
and so does how you hate,
and so does the feeling that

00:37:57.162 --> 00:38:01.849
everything you receive in life
is something you have earned.

00:38:01.849 --> 00:38:03.909
[And then I'm going to skip
down.

00:38:03.909 --> 00:38:07.985
So, he starts to laugh then at
his brother and he is not quite

00:38:07.985 --> 00:38:11.592
sure why he is laughing.]
I attempted to rise so that I

00:38:11.592 --> 00:38:14.728
could walk to my room,
but I was afraid that it would

00:38:14.728 --> 00:38:16.639
be too difficult to control my
laughing.

00:38:16.639 --> 00:38:18.079
I remained there for many,
many minutes.

00:38:18.079 --> 00:38:21.496
My brother persevered to a
little less than cry,

00:38:21.496 --> 00:38:24.550
which made my silent laughing
even more.

00:38:24.550 --> 00:38:28.271
I am able to understand now
that it was the same laugh I had

00:38:28.271 --> 00:38:31.953
in the restaurant in Lutsk,
the laugh that had the same

00:38:31.953 --> 00:38:35.660
darkness as Grandfather's laugh
and the hero's laugh.

00:38:35.660 --> 00:38:39.010
I ask leniency for writing this.
Perhaps I will remove it before

00:38:39.010 --> 00:38:42.050
I post this part to you.
I am sorry.

00:38:42.050 --> 00:38:43.870
As for Sammy Davis,
Junior, Junior,

00:38:43.870 --> 00:38:46.440
she did not eat her piece of
the potato.

00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:53.256
Those reflections on laughing
and crying: I think they might

00:38:53.256 --> 00:38:59.610
sound quite maudlin if they were
not in Alex's voice,

00:38:59.610 --> 00:39:06.160
that a writer needs to judge
very carefully whether to

00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:13.328
reflect in those direct ways
about big themes like laughter

00:39:13.328 --> 00:39:19.206
and crying or how you hate.
So, these are the topics that

00:39:19.206 --> 00:39:23.159
will be a pitfall for any new
writer sitting down to say,

00:39:23.159 --> 00:39:25.699
"I am going to write about
love."

00:39:25.699 --> 00:39:30.243
I used to teach creative
writing, and one of the

00:39:30.243 --> 00:39:34.964
exercises that I did was,
I would sit my students down

00:39:34.964 --> 00:39:37.369
and I would say,
"Okay.

00:39:37.369 --> 00:39:39.579
We're going to have a little
in-class writing today.

00:39:39.579 --> 00:39:44.931
Here are some topics that I
want you to write about just for

00:39:44.931 --> 00:39:49.285
ten minutes," and I would give
them "love," "your

00:39:49.285 --> 00:39:53.510
childhood"--what else--"death."
I can't remember what else.

00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:56.173
And so, then,
they would very earnestly do it

00:39:56.173 --> 00:39:57.989
and then I would say,
"Okay.

00:39:57.989 --> 00:40:01.399
Now I want you to take your
paper and I want you to

00:40:01.399 --> 00:40:03.989
underline every single
cliché

00:40:03.989 --> 00:40:07.663
that you wrote," and they would
come up with papers full of

00:40:07.663 --> 00:40:10.540
clichés.
And it was a little exercise

00:40:10.540 --> 00:40:14.334
just to get them to understand
that choosing a topic can get

00:40:14.334 --> 00:40:17.550
you into trouble if you choose a
very abstract,

00:40:17.550 --> 00:40:23.785
big, important question.
Of course we want books that

00:40:23.785 --> 00:40:28.685
move us and tell us about death
and love and separation and

00:40:28.685 --> 00:40:31.049
desire,
but how do you get there,

00:40:31.049 --> 00:40:33.480
and how do you talk about those
things?

00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:41.138
So, I think that Foer has
taken a risk of a sort,

00:40:41.138 --> 00:40:44.329
here.
He can do it because it's in

00:40:44.329 --> 00:40:48.491
Alex's voice.
Is the distance achieved,

00:40:48.491 --> 00:40:56.010
the self-distancing achieved,
by inhabiting a foreign voice,

00:40:56.010 --> 00:40:59.612
with its little funny jokes
that come up because of its

00:40:59.612 --> 00:41:04.266
incorrect usages?
Is that enough to prevent

00:41:04.266 --> 00:41:09.550
sentimentality,
rather than sentiment?

00:41:09.550 --> 00:41:13.770
Is it powerful enough language,
in the abstract,

00:41:13.770 --> 00:41:18.889
that it moves us as a discourse
on laughter and loving?

00:41:18.889 --> 00:41:25.659
Is the detail of Little Igor
and Alex's love for him enough?

00:41:25.659 --> 00:41:30.033
Now, remember we know nothing
about Igor as a character,

00:41:30.033 --> 00:41:34.314
his brother as a character.
Do we feel that the

00:41:34.314 --> 00:41:40.340
relationship between the two is
earned for us as readers?

00:41:40.340 --> 00:41:45.460
Maybe we do.
Sometimes I did.

00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:50.842
Other times I didn't.
So this is something that I'm

00:41:50.842 --> 00:41:54.666
still thinking about.
Does it succeed at what

00:41:54.666 --> 00:41:57.504
Franzen, too,
was trying to do,

00:41:57.504 --> 00:42:03.750
which is to infuse intellectual
word play with human resonance?

00:42:03.750 --> 00:42:05.330
Does it succeed?

00:42:12.590 --> 00:42:16.649
If you look at the
dedication to the novel,

00:42:16.649 --> 00:42:19.650
I think you learn something
too.

00:42:19.650 --> 00:42:20.870
This is under the
acknowledgments.

00:42:20.870 --> 00:42:27.940
Did any of you read this?
These are the acknowledgments.

00:42:27.940 --> 00:42:31.670
"At least once every day since
I met her, I have felt blessed

00:42:31.670 --> 00:42:35.058
to know Nicole Aragi.
She inspires me not only to try

00:42:35.058 --> 00:42:38.471
to write more ambitiously,
but to smile more widely and

00:42:38.471 --> 00:42:40.429
have a fuller,
better heart.

00:42:40.429 --> 00:42:43.792
I am so, so grateful,"--and you
hear that "so,

00:42:43.792 --> 00:42:47.678
so" again from the passage I
just read--"and it is my

00:42:47.678 --> 00:42:52.311
pleasure and honor to think of
the wonderful people at Houghton

00:42:52.311 --> 00:42:55.439
Mifflin as family,"
so on and so on,

00:42:55.439 --> 00:43:00.242
"whose advice in literature and
life seems always to boil down

00:43:00.242 --> 00:43:03.732
to "feel more,"
which is always the best

00:43:03.732 --> 00:43:07.799
advice."
So, feeling is very much on the

00:43:07.799 --> 00:43:10.770
surface of the effort here.

00:43:14.699 --> 00:43:18.460
What would it mean to read this
as a sentimental novel?

00:43:22.460 --> 00:43:27.642
Does the playful treatment of
shtetl life disable our

00:43:27.642 --> 00:43:31.130
connection with those
characters?

00:43:31.130 --> 00:43:36.321
One of the things that I think
succeeds wonderfully about this

00:43:36.321 --> 00:43:42.246
novel is Brod as a character.
I think you do want her to have

00:43:42.246 --> 00:43:48.288
a good life, as Alex does,
and you feel the tragedy of the

00:43:48.288 --> 00:43:52.788
life she gets.
And, I think you get that

00:43:52.788 --> 00:43:58.962
payoff because she is developed;
she has time to develop,

00:43:58.962 --> 00:44:03.691
in the course of the story.
So, for all its time travel

00:44:03.691 --> 00:44:06.119
back and forth,
for all its playfulness,

00:44:06.119 --> 00:44:10.270
for all the jokes and riffs,
Brod has time to develop,

00:44:10.270 --> 00:44:15.421
especially in relation to her
father and in relation to the

00:44:15.421 --> 00:44:17.659
Kolker,
her husband,

00:44:17.659 --> 00:44:24.179
and we learn things that make
her more complex over time.

00:44:24.179 --> 00:44:29.111
And so, when we finally learn
what she asked the Kolker to do

00:44:29.111 --> 00:44:33.960
after she was raped and before
she agreed to be his wife,

00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:38.828
when we learn that--and I won't
reveal it 'cause I don't know if

00:44:38.828 --> 00:44:43.464
you're all there yet--it gives
us a much more complex version

00:44:43.464 --> 00:44:48.469
of what she is as a person,
of who she is as a person.

00:44:48.469 --> 00:44:53.949
So, I think he earns it,
with Brod.

00:44:53.949 --> 00:44:57.873
That, to me,
is a kind of achievement,

00:44:57.873 --> 00:45:03.811
because of the role that
riffing plays in the development

00:45:03.811 --> 00:45:08.909
of that story.
Riffing on Jewish behavior in a

00:45:08.909 --> 00:45:14.980
novel by a Jewish writer is
certainly well-trodden ground.

00:45:14.980 --> 00:45:20.380
Roth has been treading that
ground for many decades.

00:45:20.380 --> 00:45:25.143
I think what Foer does,
that Roth didn't do,

00:45:25.143 --> 00:45:31.679
is fully identify with the
community in a convincing way,

00:45:31.679 --> 00:45:36.424
while he's doing it,
and this is related to what I

00:45:36.424 --> 00:45:42.329
will say about his use of the
Holocaust in my next lecture.

00:45:42.329 --> 00:45:45.719
I am going to stop there,
and I hope you will be sure to

00:45:45.719 --> 00:45:48.000
finish the novel by
Wednesday.

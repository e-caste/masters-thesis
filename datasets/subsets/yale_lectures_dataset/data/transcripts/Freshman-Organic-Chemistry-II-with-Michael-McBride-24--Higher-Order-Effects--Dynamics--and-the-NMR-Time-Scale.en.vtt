00:00:01.733 --> 00:00:02.767
J. MICHAEL MDBRIDE: So,
we'll finish up on

00:00:02.767 --> 00:00:05.433
NMR spectroscopy, talking

00:00:05.433 --> 00:00:10.200
about more dynamic things
involving decoupling. 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.133
Then a little bit about C-13 NMR
and double labeling 

00:00:14.133 --> 00:00:16.433
involving correlation. 

00:00:16.433 --> 00:00:18.733
And then we'll get onto another
reaction, 

00:00:18.733 --> 00:00:20.333
electrophilic aromatic
substitution. 

00:00:32.033 --> 00:00:34.700
OK, so proton decoupling. 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.433
Remember that the proton is four
times as strong a magnet 

00:00:39.433 --> 00:00:43.667
as the Carbon-13, so it
precesses much faster. 

00:00:43.667 --> 00:00:50.433
So it's easy to do a pulse that
will tilt the Carbon-13 

00:00:50.433 --> 00:00:53.767
net magnetization down into the
plane, so that it'll 

00:00:53.767 --> 00:00:57.367
precess and be an antenna that
can tell us its local field 

00:00:57.367 --> 00:01:00.167
without doing the same thing to
the proton. 

00:01:00.167 --> 00:01:06.267
And if we do that, then we see
the C-13 NMR spectrum. 

00:01:06.267 --> 00:01:08.233
And there are two peaks, because
of 

00:01:08.233 --> 00:01:09.933
the adjacent proton. 

00:01:09.933 --> 00:01:13.633
Right? it can be either up or
down, 50:50 

00:01:13.633 --> 00:01:15.600
or almost exactly 50:50 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.400
so you see two peaks. 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.133
Now suppose at the same time
you're doing that, when you do 

00:01:20.133 --> 00:01:23.067
this pulse and listen to the
C-13 to see what its local 

00:01:23.067 --> 00:01:27.533
field is, you irradiate at 100
MHz. 

00:01:27.533 --> 00:01:27.833
Right? 

00:01:27.833 --> 00:01:29.567
That won't do anything to the
C-13, 

00:01:29.567 --> 00:01:31.033
it's the wrong frequency. 

00:01:31.033 --> 00:01:33.667
But it'll now make the proton
precess. 

00:01:33.667 --> 00:01:37.767
That is, if we look in the
rotating frame, we can see a 

00:01:37.767 --> 00:01:41.767
weak field that's horizontal,
about which the 

00:01:41.767 --> 00:01:43.467
magnetism will precess. 

00:01:43.467 --> 00:01:46.567
So the protons will go down, and
then up, and then down, 

00:01:46.567 --> 00:01:48.833
and then up. 

00:01:48.833 --> 00:01:51.533
And what determines how fast it
goes up and down? 

00:01:51.533 --> 00:01:53.100
How strong this field is. 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.767
The stronger it is, the faster
it will precess. 

00:01:55.767 --> 00:01:59.433
And if it's fast enough, then
you won't see a doublet for 

00:01:59.433 --> 00:02:02.767
the C-13 anymore, because you'll
see the average. 

00:02:02.767 --> 00:02:03.567
Right? 

00:02:03.567 --> 00:02:07.533
So you'll see a single peak,
you'll proton-decouple the 

00:02:07.533 --> 00:02:10.333
C-13 spectrum and see the C-13
as if the 

00:02:10.333 --> 00:02:11.567
protons weren't there. 

00:02:14.067 --> 00:02:17.367
OK, so it depends on how much
power you put in. 

00:02:17.367 --> 00:02:22.067
Now here's a C-13 spectrum of a
given compound. 

00:02:22.067 --> 00:02:27.067
Where we're listening to the
C-13 and we see all these 

00:02:27.067 --> 00:02:29.433
different local fields, right? 

00:02:29.433 --> 00:02:32.367
But we're irradiating the proton
at the same time, but 

00:02:32.367 --> 00:02:33.933
very, very weakly. 

00:02:33.933 --> 00:02:38.633
This number up there, 40
decibels, is an inverse ratio 

00:02:38.633 --> 00:02:42.200
of how strong that horizontal
field is for the protons. 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.200
So it's 10-4th weaker than what
you'll see you 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.500
later, 10,000 times weaker. 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.067
And if we look at the carbon, we
see that some of the carbon 

00:02:51.067 --> 00:02:53.800
signals are split and some are
not split. 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.500
The ones that are split are the
ones that have 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:56.433
hydrogens on them. 

00:02:56.433 --> 00:02:59.167
So if we start from the left, we
see there's one with no 

00:02:59.167 --> 00:03:01.167
hydrogens, then one with one
hydrogen, 

00:03:01.167 --> 00:03:02.700
one with one hydrogen. 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.600
That red one is the solvent 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.733
CDCl3, right? 

00:03:07.733 --> 00:03:11.967
So we're looking at the carbon
of the CDCl3. 

00:03:11.967 --> 00:03:14.467
But it has a deuterium on it,
not a 

00:03:14.467 --> 00:03:16.333
hydrogen, so it's not split. 

00:03:16.333 --> 00:03:19.600
Then there's a carbon with two
hydrogens, a carbon with three 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.333
hydrogens, it's a quartet. 

00:03:21.333 --> 00:03:25.667
Underneath, a carbon with two
hydrogens, it's a triplet. 

00:03:25.667 --> 00:03:28.567
So very low power in the proton,
that's what we see. 

00:03:28.567 --> 00:03:31.433
Now we're going to reduce the
size of that. 

00:03:31.433 --> 00:03:34.633
And see what happens, is we
start increasing the power. 

00:03:34.633 --> 00:03:38.467
So there's 40 dB, 20 dB, 

00:03:38.467 --> 00:03:40.533
and now things are beginning to
change. 

00:03:40.533 --> 00:03:43.633
See how the patterns are
changing their multiplicity 

00:03:43.633 --> 00:03:45.167
and their intensity? 

00:03:45.167 --> 00:03:51.067
Because it turns out that when
you irradiate the protons by a 

00:03:51.067 --> 00:03:54.967
complicated mechanism it
strengthens the signal of the 

00:03:54.967 --> 00:03:57.800
carbons to which they're
coupled. 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.100
And that's called nuclear
Overhauser enhancement, as 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:02.333
you'll see. 

00:04:02.333 --> 00:04:04.867
OK. So now you see the splitting
is going away when 

00:04:04.867 --> 00:04:08.300
we get down to two decibels or
one decibel. 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:12.133
Now we see that each carbon
gives just a single peak, we've

00:04:12.133 --> 00:04:14.033
decoupled the protons. 

00:04:14.033 --> 00:04:17.133
So now we have a peak for every
carbon. 

00:04:17.133 --> 00:04:21.633
And notice, incidentally, that
the CDCl3 didn't get stronger 

00:04:21.633 --> 00:04:22.533
as we did this. 

00:04:22.533 --> 00:04:23.433
Why? 

00:04:23.433 --> 00:04:26.733
Because what strengthened the
signal was irradiating the 

00:04:26.733 --> 00:04:30.700
protons and CDCl3 doesn't have
hydrogens on it. 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.233
So it doesn't get strengthened.

00:04:33.233 --> 00:04:36.233
OK, notice also that the carbon
without a hydrogen on 

00:04:36.233 --> 00:04:38.733
it, on the far left here, didn't
get strengthened as 

00:04:38.733 --> 00:04:40.967
much as the others did. 

00:04:40.967 --> 00:04:43.567
OK, so that's decoupling, and it
can be useful. 

00:04:43.567 --> 00:04:47.467
And it can be useful in several
ways. 

00:04:47.467 --> 00:04:52.567
There's two things, you get rid
of the spin-spin splitting 

00:04:52.567 --> 00:04:54.967
so you see just a peak for each
carbon. 

00:04:54.967 --> 00:04:57.100
And also you strengthen the
signals when 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.067
they have nearby protons. 

00:05:00.067 --> 00:05:03.600
And that could be bad if you're
interested in measuring 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.933
the size of the peaks to get how
many carbons there are, 

00:05:06.933 --> 00:05:09.300
because you can't count properly
anymore because you 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.067
get different intensities with
different 

00:05:11.067 --> 00:05:12.633
neighbors of protons. 

00:05:12.633 --> 00:05:15.533
But it's good if you want to
determine structure and see 

00:05:15.533 --> 00:05:17.367
what hydrogens are how far away,
and I'll 

00:05:17.367 --> 00:05:19.633
show you that shortly. 

00:05:19.633 --> 00:05:24.633
OK, now bear in mind that
carbon-13 is only 1% in 

00:05:24.633 --> 00:05:26.167
natural abundance of carbon. 

00:05:26.167 --> 00:05:29.233
Of course, you can synthesize
the molecule with expensive  

00:05:29.233 --> 00:05:32.767
carbon-13-containing precursors
and put carbon-13 

00:05:32.767 --> 00:05:35.500
where are you want it in a
molecule, and then the signal 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.633
from that carbon will be ever so
much stronger. 

00:05:37.633 --> 00:05:41.867
If you put in pure carbon C-13
in some position, the signal 

00:05:41.867 --> 00:05:43.867
would be 100 times stronger. 

00:05:43.867 --> 00:05:46.467
In fact, 200 times stronger than
without. 

00:05:50.667 --> 00:05:51.800
No, pardon me. 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:55.533
It would be 100 times stronger,
because it would be 

00:05:55.533 --> 00:05:57.467
100% instead of 1%. 

00:05:57.467 --> 00:06:02.500
OK, so here's a compound,
neotame, it's 

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:03.933
an artificial sweetener. 

00:06:03.933 --> 00:06:10.133
And it's the proton-decoupled
C-13 spectrum. 

00:06:10.133 --> 00:06:13.133
So you see one peak for each
carbon. 

00:06:13.133 --> 00:06:15.800
There are 20 carbons, there are
20 peaks. 

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:18.967
But you can't go by their
intensities. 

00:06:18.967 --> 00:06:22.133
Now, let's see what we can make
of this. 

00:06:22.133 --> 00:06:25.233
It's proton-decoupled, so
there's one peak per carbon 

00:06:25.233 --> 00:06:28.400
and, being carbon, it's pretty
well spread out. 

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:32.267
Remember, the range of hydrogen
chemical shifts is 

00:06:32.267 --> 00:06:34.233
only about 10 parts per million.

00:06:34.233 --> 00:06:36.133
The range for carbon is hundreds
of 

00:06:36.133 --> 00:06:37.333
parts per million here. 

00:06:37.333 --> 00:06:41.067
200 parts per million are shown.

00:06:41.067 --> 00:06:44.433
Now why is there no C-13-C-13
splitting? 

00:06:44.433 --> 00:06:46.967
There's no proton splitting
because it's decoupled. 

00:06:46.967 --> 00:06:49.500
But why no C-13-C-13 splitting?

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:53.033
STUDENT: The likelihood of two
C-13s adjacent in the same 

00:06:53.033 --> 00:06:53.967
molecule is unlikely. 

00:06:53.967 --> 00:06:56.700
PROFESSOR: If it's only 1%
natural abundance, and you're 

00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:00.500
a C-13 so that you're giving a
signal, the chance that your 

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:04.067
neighbor is C-13 is only 1%, so
there would be tiny, tiny 

00:07:04.067 --> 00:07:04.800
peaks from those 

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:07.067
you don't see them. 

00:07:07.067 --> 00:07:10.733
OK, so that's what Chris just
said. 

00:07:10.733 --> 00:07:15.467
OK now, let's see if we can
figure out which carbons these 

00:07:15.467 --> 00:07:16.900
are, that we're looking at. 

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:19.200
And of course, this is how it
was done empirically. 

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:21.667
People put in known compounds
and figured out what the

00:07:21.667 --> 00:07:23.567
chemical shifts... what peaks 

00:07:23.567 --> 00:07:25.400
were from one compound to the
next. 

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:27.300
And then they figured out this
comes in this range, this 

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:29.567
comes in this range, this comes
in this range. 

00:07:29.567 --> 00:07:32.633
So let us see, knowing what
these peaks are. 

00:07:32.633 --> 00:07:34.433
OK first, there are these ones
that are way 

00:07:34.433 --> 00:07:37.033
down close to 200. 

00:07:37.033 --> 00:07:40.200
They're numbers 1, 13, and 4. 

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:43.767
So what do 1, 13, and 4 have in
common that turns out to 

00:07:43.767 --> 00:07:46.433
make them way far downfield?

00:07:48.333 --> 00:07:50.500
Ellen, what do you say?

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:54.267
What do 1, 13, and 4 have in
common that makes

00:07:54.267 --> 00:07:56.533
them different from the
other carbons?

00:07:56.533 --> 00:07:59.000
STUDENT: They're almost like
esters. 

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.533
Like, double bonding to an O. 

00:08:01.533 --> 00:08:04.667
PROFESSOR: Yeah, the double bond
to an O. Carbonyl carbons 

00:08:04.667 --> 00:08:05.933
are way downfield. 

00:08:05.933 --> 00:08:09.933
OK, now we've got 7 and 8 to 12.

00:08:09.933 --> 00:08:13.233
So there's 7 and there's 8, 9,
10, 11, 12. 

00:08:13.233 --> 00:08:15.367
Pretty clear what those are,
right? 

00:08:15.367 --> 00:08:16.800
Those are the ones on a benzene

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:18.667
ring, aromatic carbons. 

00:08:18.667 --> 00:08:21.567
OK, then there are ones that are
a little bit further down 

00:08:21.567 --> 00:08:23.433
than the others, and those are
those blue ones. 

00:08:23.433 --> 00:08:26.167
What do they have in common? 

00:08:26.167 --> 00:08:30.167
Rahul, what do you say they have
in common? 

00:08:30.167 --> 00:08:31.533
STUDENT: Tertiary? 

00:08:31.533 --> 00:08:37.033
PROFESSOR: They're not all
tertiary, no. In fact, only 

00:08:37.033 --> 00:08:40.600
two of them have three things
associated with them, the 

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:42.467
others have one and two. 

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:50.000
Lauren, can you see what the
blue ones have in common? 

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.267
In hydrogen, what makes things
come a 

00:08:52.267 --> 00:08:54.933
little bit further downfield? 

00:08:54.933 --> 00:08:55.900
Yeah Amy? 

00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:59.000
STUDENT: Well, the hydrogen
would be like deshielding from

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.233
an oxygen or something, like
nitrogen or oxygen.

00:09:03.233 --> 00:09:06.667
PROFESSOR: They all have an
electronegative atom next to 

00:09:06.667 --> 00:09:08.233
them, right? 

00:09:08.233 --> 00:09:11.300
Nitrogen or oxygen. 

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:13.733
So those are ones. A carbon
that's attached to something 

00:09:13.733 --> 00:09:14.800
electronegative. 

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:17.967
And then, finally, you have the
others, which are attached 

00:09:17.967 --> 00:09:19.333
only to carbons. 

00:09:19.333 --> 00:09:21.300
OK, so you could begin to figure
out these, and you can 

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:23.200
get tables of what comes where.

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:25.900
And then you can start dealing
with unknown compounds and 

00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:27.067
figure out what it's telling
you. 

00:09:27.067 --> 00:09:30.867
But a nice thing about this
proton-decoupled spectrum is 

00:09:30.867 --> 00:09:33.267
that there's just one peak for
each carbon, and they're well 

00:09:33.267 --> 00:09:34.233
spread out. 

00:09:34.233 --> 00:09:37.033
So that it's good to do this
kind of thing. 

00:09:37.033 --> 00:09:39.333
So those are the alkane carbons.

00:09:39.333 --> 00:09:42.033
OK, now the power of
correlation. 

00:09:42.033 --> 00:09:45.700
Often when you can measure two
things on the same subject 

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:48.533
simultaneously, you get a lot
more information than 

00:09:48.533 --> 00:09:52.100
measuring one, or measuring the
other, or measuring them 

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:53.400
independently. 

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:57.100
I'll show you that example with
C-13 double labeling and 

00:09:57.100 --> 00:09:58.633
also in two-dimensional. 

00:09:58.633 --> 00:10:01.233
As it's called, nuclear magnetic
resonance. 

00:10:01.233 --> 00:10:04.400
So first, C-13 double labeling.

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:07.267
And we'll talk about lanosterol
biogenesis. 

00:10:07.267 --> 00:10:10.067
In fact, we already talked about
it, if you look back at 

00:10:10.067 --> 00:10:11.633
lecture 52. 

00:10:11.633 --> 00:10:14.667
OK, so remember we got squalene
from isopentenyl 

00:10:14.667 --> 00:10:15.633
pyrophosphate. 

00:10:15.633 --> 00:10:18.067
Then it curled around and we had
this complicated thing 

00:10:18.067 --> 00:10:21.833
where it zipped up going one
way, and then we had all these 

00:10:21.833 --> 00:10:23.100
rearrangements. 

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.233
So as we said at that time, this
is the source of 

00:10:31.233 --> 00:10:34.133
cholesterol and the steroid
hormones. 

00:10:34.133 --> 00:10:37.067
And it's a very cute story, how
all that rearrangement 

00:10:37.067 --> 00:10:38.267
took place 

00:10:38.267 --> 00:10:42.133
OK. But there's a question
whether it's true. 

00:10:42.133 --> 00:10:46.733
And I said at that time, wait
for NMR. So now we're at NMR, 

00:10:46.733 --> 00:10:48.667
so you can get the answer. 

00:10:48.667 --> 00:10:51.833
OK, so you can use
Carbon-13-labeling to figure

00:10:51.833 --> 00:10:52.433
this out. 

00:10:52.433 --> 00:10:58.667
So if you feed the plant that
makes this stuff Carbon-13 

00:10:58.667 --> 00:11:01.467
labeled isopentenyl
pyrophosphate-- 

00:11:01.467 --> 00:11:05.933
in that particular carbon, that
substituted carbon-- 

00:11:05.933 --> 00:11:10.033
then you can see where that
would appear in the squalene. 

00:11:10.033 --> 00:11:12.400
According to the way we linked
them together before, it 

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:13.933
should be those carbons. 

00:11:13.933 --> 00:11:16.567
Then when you curl it around and
do all this stuff to make 

00:11:16.567 --> 00:11:21.000
lanosterol, those peaks should
be labeled with C-13 and 

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.267
therefore 100 times stronger
than the other 

00:11:23.267 --> 00:11:24.700
peaks in that spectrum. 

00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:26.400
And indeed they are. 

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:29.100
So that supports it. 

00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:30.700
Or you could do it a different
way. 

00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:32.433
You could label the methyl
group. 

00:11:32.433 --> 00:11:35.333
And if you label the methyl
group, it turns out that those 

00:11:35.333 --> 00:11:37.967
methyl groups should be labeled
in squalene. 

00:11:37.967 --> 00:11:39.933
And then if you curl it around,
it should be those 

00:11:39.933 --> 00:11:40.600
methyl groups. 

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:43.200
And indeed, they're 100 times
stronger 

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:45.167
than the other signals. 

00:11:45.167 --> 00:11:50.600
But much more interesting than
this is to do double labeling. 

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:52.667
So if you label both, you get
that. 

00:11:52.667 --> 00:11:53.533
Big deal. 

00:11:53.533 --> 00:11:55.033
That's just the same information

00:11:55.033 --> 00:11:56.600
we got before right? 

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:59.133
Except done in one experiment
rather than two. 

00:11:59.133 --> 00:12:02.633
And, in a sense this is not as
valuable as these 

00:12:02.633 --> 00:12:05.467
two independent label
experiments, because you don't 

00:12:05.467 --> 00:12:07.733
know but what two of those
carbons might, in principle, 

00:12:07.733 --> 00:12:09.000
have changed places. 

00:12:11.133 --> 00:12:14.300
But the double labeling is much
more important 

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:16.967
if you do it dilute. 

00:12:16.967 --> 00:12:18.400
Now what do I mean dilute? 

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:22.000
I've been talking as if we put
100% C-13 in here. 

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.667
But suppose we don't put nearly
100%, suppose we only 

00:12:25.667 --> 00:12:28.300
put 10% in. 

00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:31.167
But suppose that those 10% that
are 

00:12:31.167 --> 00:12:34.633
labeled are double labeled. 

00:12:34.633 --> 00:12:40.233
So we prepare a sample that's
100% labeled in two positions, 

00:12:40.233 --> 00:12:43.833
but then we mix it with 90%
percent of unlabeled material 

00:12:43.833 --> 00:12:47.600
and feed it to the organism and
get the stuff out. 

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:51.600
OK, so what we're going to do is
a dilute double label. 

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:54.033
Now why do it dilute? 

00:12:54.033 --> 00:12:59.933
Because then, when label goes
in, two labels go in. 

00:12:59.933 --> 00:13:04.567
But it's unlikely that any given
squalene will have two 

00:13:04.567 --> 00:13:07.433
different positions double
labeled, or two sets of 

00:13:07.433 --> 00:13:08.567
positions double labeled. 

00:13:08.567 --> 00:13:11.267
Because only 10% of the stuff is
double labeled. 

00:13:11.267 --> 00:13:15.700
So when a squalene is double
labeled, it'll be labeled in 

00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:18.733
just one pair of positions, a
given molecule. 

00:13:18.733 --> 00:13:21.600
Like there. 

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:24.200
So those two come labeled
together. 

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:27.233
The signal is 10 times stronger
because 

00:13:27.233 --> 00:13:28.900
remember, it was 10%. 

00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:31.567
It's 10 times stronger than it
was for the 

00:13:31.567 --> 00:13:34.000
ones that aren't labeled. 

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.433
But what's special about it? 

00:13:36.433 --> 00:13:39.300
Can anybody see what's going to
be special about the signal 

00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:41.600
we get from these molecules that
look like that? 

00:13:45.067 --> 00:13:47.167
Ayesha, have you got an idea? 

00:13:47.167 --> 00:13:50.067
STUDENT: They're going to be the
same more or less 

00:13:50.067 --> 00:13:51.500
because they're just an extra--

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:53.467
PROFESSOR: They're going to be
the same what? 

00:13:53.467 --> 00:13:54.900
STUDENT: They're going to be the
same more or less 

00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:57.567
because they're just extra
carbons and 

00:13:57.567 --> 00:13:59.767
there's no special function. 

00:13:59.767 --> 00:14:02.233
PROFESSOR: I didn't quite
understand you, but I was 

00:14:02.233 --> 00:14:05.200
listening for special words and
I didn't hear them. 

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:07.267
Sebastian, have you got a
special word for us? 

00:14:07.267 --> 00:14:08.800
STUDENT: You get splitting? 

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:10.333
PROFESSOR: Ah, they'll split
each other, because now the 

00:14:10.333 --> 00:14:12.433
C-13s are next to one another. 

00:14:12.433 --> 00:14:15.400
Because they're not coming in at
random 10%, they're coming 

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:16.567
in as a pair. 

00:14:16.567 --> 00:14:19.733
So now when we look at the
signal from that, it's going 

00:14:19.733 --> 00:14:22.967
to be a double doublet. 

00:14:22.967 --> 00:14:26.067
The blue and the red one are
going to split each other. 

00:14:26.067 --> 00:14:29.833
Now other molecules in the same
sample will turn out to 

00:14:29.833 --> 00:14:31.467
have been labeled elsewhere. 

00:14:31.467 --> 00:14:35.667
For example, so that proves that
those entered as a unit. 

00:14:35.667 --> 00:14:38.467
Others will have come in there,
and those will also be 

00:14:38.467 --> 00:14:41.100
a double doublet, show that they
came in as a unit. 

00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:43.067
And if we go over to the other
end of the molecule, those 

00:14:43.067 --> 00:14:43.900
will be a double doublet. 

00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:46.133
And those singles will be a
double doublet. 

00:14:46.133 --> 00:14:46.867
Great. 

00:14:46.867 --> 00:14:49.733
What's going to be different? 

00:14:49.733 --> 00:14:54.867
Suppose we had that molecule
where we had a methide shift. 

00:14:54.867 --> 00:14:57.800
So the carbon got away from its
original neighbor. 

00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:01.867
Now it won't be next to a C-13
and it'll be just a pair of 

00:15:01.867 --> 00:15:05.533
singlets instead of a double
doublet in a 

00:15:05.533 --> 00:15:08.267
proton-decoupled spectrum. 

00:15:08.267 --> 00:15:12.133
And the same thing will be true
there. 

00:15:12.133 --> 00:15:15.633
So this double labeling
absolutely proves that these 

00:15:15.633 --> 00:15:18.433
rearrangements took place. 

00:15:18.433 --> 00:15:20.167
So those two, incidentally, are

00:15:20.167 --> 00:15:23.333
labeled in the same molecule. 

00:15:23.333 --> 00:15:25.967
But they're not adjacent to one
another anymore, so they 

00:15:25.967 --> 00:15:27.200
don't show splitting. 

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:32.700
And those are both labeled, the
ones that are adjacent to 

00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:34.933
one another, but not in the same
molecule. 

00:15:34.933 --> 00:15:36.967
So they don't do splitting
either. 

00:15:36.967 --> 00:15:41.700
So this dilute double label
experiment enhances the same 

00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:44.967
12 peaks as the single label
experiments did, the two 

00:15:44.967 --> 00:15:46.567
single label experiments. 

00:15:46.567 --> 00:15:49.500
But only eight of them show
spin-spin splitting because 

00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:51.033
their bonds stay intact. 

00:15:51.033 --> 00:15:55.067
So this strongly confirms the
story I told you before about 

00:15:55.067 --> 00:15:57.033
the rearrangement scheme. 

00:15:57.033 --> 00:15:59.100
OK, so this is the power of
correlation. 

00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:01.867
And let's look at a different
kind of power of correlation 

00:16:01.867 --> 00:16:05.133
in what's called two-dimensional
NMR spectroscopy. 

00:16:05.133 --> 00:16:07.667
Now here's a two-dimensional NMR
spectrum. 

00:16:07.667 --> 00:16:10.233
And the way it's collected is
rather technical and we don't 

00:16:10.233 --> 00:16:11.667
have time to go into it. 

00:16:11.667 --> 00:16:14.333
But it shows that there are two
different frequencies 

00:16:14.333 --> 00:16:15.567
being used. 

00:16:17.633 --> 00:16:20.767
And if you go along the diagonal
of this plot, those 

00:16:20.767 --> 00:16:24.200
two frequencies are the same. 

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:26.367
So what you see there, when you
have just a certain 

00:16:26.367 --> 00:16:29.400
frequency going in, is the
normal spectrum you see along 

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:30.433
the diagonal. 

00:16:30.433 --> 00:16:33.133
But this is the spectrum of a
protein. 

00:16:33.133 --> 00:16:35.633
So it's got a whole bunch of
amino acids linked 

00:16:35.633 --> 00:16:36.967
together like that. 

00:16:36.967 --> 00:16:40.067
And we're in the range of the
spectrum between 6 and 9, 

00:16:40.067 --> 00:16:43.333
where the N-H protons show up In
this 

00:16:43.333 --> 00:16:46.333
particular kind of molecule. 

00:16:46.333 --> 00:16:48.867
So there are a whole bunch of
them in this long chain and 

00:16:48.867 --> 00:16:51.067
they all overlap with one
another, and it's very hard to 

00:16:51.067 --> 00:16:52.967
tell what's going on. 

00:16:52.967 --> 00:16:55.633
But if you don't have these two
frequencies you're using 

00:16:55.633 --> 00:16:59.933
the same, you're looking at one
while you're irradiating 

00:16:59.933 --> 00:17:01.400
another one. 

00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:05.467
And that affects the intensity
of the one you're looking at. 

00:17:05.467 --> 00:17:08.200
That's this nuclear Overhauser
enhancement that we talked 

00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:11.367
about, where you irradiate one,
other things that it's 

00:17:11.367 --> 00:17:14.100
coupled to will change their
intensity. 

00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:18.267
So what we're going to do is
plot on the off-diagonal how 

00:17:18.267 --> 00:17:23.433
one frequency is influenced by
having other frequencies in 

00:17:23.433 --> 00:17:26.567
there, in its intensity. 

00:17:26.567 --> 00:17:29.200
So that's called NOE, or nuclear
Overhauser 

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:30.033
enhancement. 

00:17:30.033 --> 00:17:35.100
And it comes, incidentally, by
through-space magnetic 

00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:35.800
interaction. 

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:38.100
Not the stuff like we talked
about coupling where it goes 

00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:39.200
through bonds. 

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:42.067
This works through space. 

00:17:42.067 --> 00:17:46.433
So it works if the two protons
you're looking at-- the one 

00:17:46.433 --> 00:17:48.567
you're looking at and the one
you're tickling to see if it 

00:17:48.567 --> 00:17:50.133
influences this one-- 

00:17:50.133 --> 00:17:52.633
if they're within about 6A of
one another. 

00:17:55.467 --> 00:17:58.967
So as I said, this is mostly
these N-H protons. 

00:17:58.967 --> 00:18:02.733
And for one thing, one advantage
of having these off- 

00:18:02.733 --> 00:18:05.800
diagonal peaks is they're much
less congested than what's 

00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:10.133
along the diagonal than the
normal spectrum. 

00:18:10.133 --> 00:18:13.533
So for example, we're looking
here at the NH proton that's 

00:18:13.533 --> 00:18:17.167
at 7.25 parts per million. 

00:18:17.167 --> 00:18:19.167
But you can see that it
interacts with 

00:18:19.167 --> 00:18:20.500
several other protons. 

00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:23.333
It's within 6A of signals that
are at 

00:18:23.333 --> 00:18:27.700
8.9, 8.3, 8.25, 7.7. 

00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:30.733
Now you don't measure the exact
distance, all you know 

00:18:30.733 --> 00:18:33.867
is that it's close. 

00:18:33.867 --> 00:18:36.300
But this allows you to make a
three- 

00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:38.500
dimensional map of the protein.

00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:43.900
And the way you do it, is first
you have to know which 

00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:47.833
NH goes with which R group. 

00:18:47.833 --> 00:18:50.267
So you see that that NH-- 

00:18:50.267 --> 00:18:52.267
the one you're looking at, the
red one-- 

00:18:52.267 --> 00:18:54.900
is close to that blue one. 

00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:56.833
So it'll influence it. 

00:18:56.833 --> 00:19:00.500
But the blue one is then close
to Hs that are in the R group, 

00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:05.733
so you can tell which R group
that that blue H is nearby, 

00:19:05.733 --> 00:19:08.667
and which one the red H is near.

00:19:08.667 --> 00:19:11.933
So the red is near the blue is
near the R. So you know which 

00:19:11.933 --> 00:19:18.533
NH is near which R. And now the
way you make a map, then, 

00:19:18.533 --> 00:19:19.700
in this way-- 

00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:21.667
Professor Loria, who does this
kind of 

00:19:21.667 --> 00:19:23.833
thing, uses this analogy-- 

00:19:23.833 --> 00:19:29.667
it's like making a map of a town
if all you have is a 

00:19:29.667 --> 00:19:33.400
telephone and a telephone book.

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:36.433
Sometimes there's a front page
that has a map of the town, 

00:19:36.433 --> 00:19:37.600
then that's easy. 

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:40.367
But if you don't have the map of
the town, then what you do 

00:19:40.367 --> 00:19:42.033
is you just call someone at
random. 

00:19:42.033 --> 00:19:43.600
Say, Hi, how are you today? 

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:44.800
Blah blah blah. 

00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:47.400
Could you tell me who three of
your near neighbors are? 

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:50.233
And they tell you three of their
near neighbors. 

00:19:50.233 --> 00:19:52.500
Then you call those people, and
you say Hi, can you tell 

00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:54.067
me who three of your near
neighbors are? 

00:19:54.067 --> 00:19:54.767
And they tell you. 

00:19:54.767 --> 00:19:56.633
And then you call the next one,
Who are three of your 

00:19:56.633 --> 00:19:57.500
near neighbors? 

00:19:57.500 --> 00:20:00.433
So once you know who is near
what, then you can see that 

00:20:00.433 --> 00:20:03.400
there will be a map that will
allow you to figure 

00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:04.967
out what's near what. 

00:20:04.967 --> 00:20:08.767
Especially if you have some
help, because you know in the 

00:20:08.767 --> 00:20:12.100
case of the protons, they have
to fit with normal bond 

00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:14.700
distances, normal bond angles,
and so on. 

00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:17.633
So if you do molecular mechanics
together with this 

00:20:17.633 --> 00:20:20.567
knowing what's near what, you
can get a very good three- 

00:20:20.567 --> 00:20:22.667
dimensional structure of the
protein. 

00:20:22.667 --> 00:20:25.600
And the nice thing about this,
from the point of view of 

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:29.800
people who are actually working
with proteins-- what's 

00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:32.433
the best way of getting the
three-dimensional structure of 

00:20:32.433 --> 00:20:35.833
something like a protein or
anything? 

00:20:35.833 --> 00:20:37.967
X-ray, but you need a crystal. 

00:20:37.967 --> 00:20:40.667
For this, you don't need a
crystal. 

00:20:40.667 --> 00:20:42.867
So you can find the structure
that way. 

00:20:42.867 --> 00:20:45.500
So with molecular mechanics
constraint, you get the 3D 

00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:48.567
structure without a crystal. 

00:20:48.567 --> 00:20:52.733
Now here's a different kind of
2D correlation with NMR. It's 

00:20:52.733 --> 00:20:57.200
correlation not in space, but in
time. 

00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:00.467
So this is the spectrum of a
cation, that cation that's 

00:21:00.467 --> 00:21:01.600
shown at the right. 

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:05.600
Notice it's benzene with methyl
groups all around it, 

00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:10.500
with one extra methyl group and
a positive charge. 

00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:13.800
Now in fact, you can get this in
solution as long as you 

00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:17.000
don't have anything that reacts
with cations in there, 

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.267
that reacts with low LUMO, so
you need very, very non-basic 

00:21:21.267 --> 00:21:23.933
solvents to do this. 

00:21:23.933 --> 00:21:28.633
So again, the diagonal running a
different way this time-- 

00:21:28.633 --> 00:21:32.167
the increase in parts per
million is down to the right, 

00:21:32.167 --> 00:21:35.233
rather than what we usually see,
increasing to the left. 

00:21:35.233 --> 00:21:38.600
But anyhow, it's color coded,
according to these peaks that 

00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:41.933
show what they are in the
molecule. 

00:21:41.933 --> 00:21:49.467
So the scale is slanted and
backwards. 

00:21:49.467 --> 00:21:55.800
So you see that if you look at
the resonance structures-- 

00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:57.700
that one, that one, that one-- 

00:21:57.700 --> 00:22:00.300
you can see that the blue and
the green are near where 

00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:02.700
there's positive charge in the
resonance structure. 

00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:07.800
So they're far downfield, very
deshielded 

00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:09.067
compared to the others. 

00:22:14.467 --> 00:22:16.000
Now this can rearrange. 

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:22.233
A methide can shift, so one of
the red methyls on the top 

00:22:22.233 --> 00:22:23.733
shifted to the right. 

00:22:23.733 --> 00:22:27.300
So now you've changed which
methyl groups 

00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:29.400
are in which locations. 

00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:35.933
So now the red one at the top,
this one and this one are now 

00:22:35.933 --> 00:22:38.767
C, and will be shifted way
downfield. 

00:22:38.767 --> 00:22:42.267
This one will be shifted
downfield-- 

00:22:42.267 --> 00:22:44.667
what was blue before in the D 

00:22:44.667 --> 00:22:46.000
position, and so on. 

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.900
Then this blue one, which was
downfield before is now an A, 

00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:50.967
it's up here. 

00:22:50.967 --> 00:22:53.133
So we've changed the locations,
the local 

00:22:53.133 --> 00:22:55.000
frequencies, the local fields. 

00:22:58.167 --> 00:23:00.300
So that's a methide shift. 

00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:03.267
But is it a 1,2 methide shift? 

00:23:03.267 --> 00:23:06.233
Because it's possible that the
methyl, instead of going just 

00:23:06.233 --> 00:23:10.267
to its neighbor, would move to
the center of the ring, up 

00:23:10.267 --> 00:23:11.833
above the center of the ring and
then it 

00:23:11.833 --> 00:23:13.367
could come down anywhere. 

00:23:13.367 --> 00:23:16.200
Wouldn't have to come down
adjacent to where it started. 

00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:19.900
So you could have a 1,anywhere
shift. 

00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:23.033
Now you can distinguish that and
measure the rates with 

00:23:23.033 --> 00:23:28.900
this NMR spectrum, this two-
dimensional NMR spectrum. 

00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:32.433
So again, we're seeing when one

00:23:32.433 --> 00:23:34.733
frequency influences another. 

00:23:34.733 --> 00:23:38.533
Now if a given set of protons
moves from one position to 

00:23:38.533 --> 00:23:42.367
another, then having been
irradiating one influences 

00:23:42.367 --> 00:23:44.633
what happens where it ended up.

00:23:44.633 --> 00:23:46.967
Because those same protons are
now here. 

00:23:46.967 --> 00:23:49.733
So here you see off-diagonal
peaks where 

00:23:49.733 --> 00:23:52.400
one has become another. 

00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:56.433
So we can see here, for example,
that the proton that 

00:23:56.433 --> 00:23:59.967
was in position C becomes A. And
that's what happened in 

00:23:59.967 --> 00:24:03.667
the blue, here, when we had that
1,2 rearrangement. 

00:24:03.667 --> 00:24:07.700
We can also see that D becomes
B, and that you can see 

00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:08.867
happened here. 

00:24:08.867 --> 00:24:14.233
And you can see that B becomes
C. But you notice there's not 

00:24:14.233 --> 00:24:18.900
A becomes B, A becomes D, or C
becomes D. So you don't have 

00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:20.567
peaks for some of these patterns
that 

00:24:20.567 --> 00:24:21.667
you could have done. 

00:24:21.667 --> 00:24:26.567
Now if you go through a whole
sequence of the these, then 

00:24:26.567 --> 00:24:29.633
you can start any place and end
any place else. 

00:24:29.633 --> 00:24:31.600
But it takes a longer time. 

00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:35.400
So depending on the time scale
of this thing, you can tell 

00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:37.367
which things happen quickly. 

00:24:37.367 --> 00:24:40.300
And what happens quickly is a
1,2 shift, not 

00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:41.600
a 1 anywhere shift. 

00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:44.200
So again, that's information on
mechanism. 

00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:46.867
It comes from two-dimensional
NMR spectroscopy. 

00:24:46.867 --> 00:24:52.567
And it's proton versus proton
correlation in time. 

00:24:52.567 --> 00:24:57.467
That's, incidentally, just
another visualization of the 

00:24:57.467 --> 00:25:00.300
same map I showed before, that
shows the peaks on the 

00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:04.100
diagonals and the off- diagonal
peaks. 

00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:08.967
OK, now we've finished with NMR.
We'll refer to it again, 

00:25:08.967 --> 00:25:12.433
but we've finished discussing
it. 

00:25:12.433 --> 00:25:14.933
And we'll go on to the next
important reaction, which is 

00:25:14.933 --> 00:25:17.167
electrophilic aromatic
substitution. 

00:25:17.167 --> 00:25:19.767
We talked about electrophilic
things before. 

00:25:19.767 --> 00:25:23.033
Remember, electro philic
addition to an alkene. 

00:25:23.033 --> 00:25:25.267
Now you might think benzene is
an alkene, so you can get 

00:25:25.267 --> 00:25:28.267
electro philic addition to the
double bonds of benzene, but 

00:25:28.267 --> 00:25:29.433
you don't get addition. 

00:25:29.433 --> 00:25:32.033
You get substitution. 

00:25:32.033 --> 00:25:34.300
So here's an example of
substituting 

00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:36.067
deuterium for hydrogen. 

00:25:36.067 --> 00:25:39.167
You put benzene and concentrated
sulfuric acid 

00:25:39.167 --> 00:25:42.767
that has deuterium in it, and
you get deuterium first in one 

00:25:42.767 --> 00:25:44.267
position then, of course, in
other 

00:25:44.267 --> 00:25:48.267
positions in the benzene. 

00:25:50.867 --> 00:25:54.100
So you can go all the way to
C6D6, that's how you prepare 

00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:56.867
deuterated benzene if you want
to use it for a solvent for 

00:25:56.867 --> 00:25:58.133
something, for example. 

00:26:00.467 --> 00:26:02.900
You can use other electrophiles
as well, not 

00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:08.200
just D+, you can use NO2+, Br+,
sulphur+-, R+ 

00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:10.733
and RC=O+. 

00:26:10.733 --> 00:26:13.333
All these things can substitute
for hydrogen, and 

00:26:13.333 --> 00:26:16.267
we're going to talk about those.

00:26:16.267 --> 00:26:20.867
Now, the mechanism is that the
deuterium, D+, the 

00:26:20.867 --> 00:26:23.900
deuteron, adds to the ring. 

00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:28.233
But that, notice, changes the
aromatic ring into just a 

00:26:28.233 --> 00:26:30.267
regular pentadienyl system. 

00:26:30.267 --> 00:26:32.867
So you lose a lot of resonance
stabilization. 

00:26:32.867 --> 00:26:36.600
It happens, but it's not very
stable and it'll easily come 

00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:39.333
off again if there's anything
that can take a proton. 

00:26:39.333 --> 00:26:43.033
But if you have a very, very
non-nucleophilic, non-basic 

00:26:43.033 --> 00:26:46.167
solvent, nothing to take it off,
then it can stay on and 

00:26:46.167 --> 00:26:49.200
in fact it's observable. 

00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:52.033
You can get spectra of it. 

00:26:52.033 --> 00:26:55.167
And so in electrophilic addition
to alkenes, the next thing that

00:26:55.167 --> 00:26:58.567
happens is a nucleophile would
add, and you'd 

00:26:58.567 --> 00:26:59.967
lose the double bond. 

00:26:59.967 --> 00:27:03.500
But here it's easier to lose the
deuteron or, more 

00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:05.200
interestingly, the proton. 

00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:06.833
Losing the deuteron would take
you back to 

00:27:06.833 --> 00:27:08.000
the starting material. 

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.500
But losing the proton, the H,
then takes you to the 

00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:11.967
substituted product. 

00:27:11.967 --> 00:27:17.733
And that's easier than adding a
nucleophile, because you get 

00:27:17.733 --> 00:27:19.933
back to the aromatic
stabilization, 30 

00:27:19.933 --> 00:27:20.967
kilocalories. 

00:27:20.967 --> 00:27:22.833
And remember, we just saw a
spectrum 

00:27:22.833 --> 00:27:25.133
that looked like that. 

00:27:25.133 --> 00:27:31.833
When you added not H, but CH3+,
in this case, to the 

00:27:31.833 --> 00:27:32.967
hexamethylbenzene. 

00:27:32.967 --> 00:27:38.200
So it's possible to see these
things in NMR. So there's the 

00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:41.767
benzene, the D+ comes on, we get
that. 

00:27:41.767 --> 00:27:46.000
Notice that it converts the
aromatic ring into a chain, 

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:47.700
destroying the aromaticity. 

00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:51.067
Let's look at the orbitals that
are involved, just using 

00:27:51.067 --> 00:27:53.067
this simple Huckel program. 

00:27:53.067 --> 00:27:56.700
So benzene, we've looked at the
orbitals of that on the 

00:27:56.700 --> 00:27:59.267
left, and pentadienyl we looked
at before, too 

00:27:59.267 --> 00:28:00.900
and we see it on the right. 

00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:05.333
Now, the most interesting
orbital in pentadienyl is the 

00:28:05.333 --> 00:28:08.067
one that's indicated in yellow
over there. 

00:28:08.067 --> 00:28:14.833
The highest of the low three
orbitals, and it's at 0. 

00:28:14.833 --> 00:28:18.833
And you know it's at 0, the same
energy as a P orbital. 

00:28:18.833 --> 00:28:21.767
How do you know the energy of
that molecular orbital, 

00:28:21.767 --> 00:28:24.700
consisting of three P orbitals
is the same energy 

00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:26.033
as a normal P orbital? 

00:28:29.433 --> 00:28:31.467
Remember, if you make a double
bond and put the two next to 

00:28:31.467 --> 00:28:34.633
one another, they overlap, one
goes down, one goes up, it's 

00:28:34.633 --> 00:28:35.667
not to same energy. 

00:28:35.667 --> 00:28:37.167
But this one has the same energy
as 

00:28:37.167 --> 00:28:38.633
an isolated P orbital. 

00:28:38.633 --> 00:28:40.433
How do you know that? 

00:28:40.433 --> 00:28:42.533
Notice how many nodes are there
in the lowest one, the 

00:28:42.533 --> 00:28:44.200
one that's about minus two? 

00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:46.633
How many nodes for the pi
orbitals? 

00:28:49.933 --> 00:28:54.567
One, two, three, four, five P
orbitals connected in a chain. 

00:28:54.567 --> 00:28:57.400
How many nodes in the lowest
combination? 

00:28:57.400 --> 00:28:58.267
STUDENT: Zero. 

00:28:58.267 --> 00:28:59.533
PROFESSOR: Zero, except for the
node of the p

00:28:59.533 --> 00:29:00.267
orbitals, of course. 

00:29:00.267 --> 00:29:01.200
So zero. 

00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:03.800
Then the next one, the one
that's at about -1? 

00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:04.700
STUDENT: One. 

00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:05.133
PROFESSOR: One. 

00:29:05.133 --> 00:29:05.900
How about the ours? 

00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:06.700
STUDENT: Two. 

00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:08.533
PROFESSOR: OK, and so there are
two nodes. 

00:29:08.533 --> 00:29:11.633
Red, white, red on the top. 

00:29:11.633 --> 00:29:15.267
Now, how do we know the energy
of that? 

00:29:15.267 --> 00:29:16.667
How much overlap is there? 

00:29:16.667 --> 00:29:17.367
STUDENT: Zero. 

00:29:17.367 --> 00:29:19.667
PROFESSOR: None, they're not
next to one another. 

00:29:19.667 --> 00:29:23.100
So it's the same as an isolated
p orbital at the 

00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:25.100
Huckel approximation. 

00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:28.500
OK, so that one is very
interesting, that SOMO. 

00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:32.467
It's non-bonding in the case
where we have a single 

00:29:32.467 --> 00:29:35.233
electron in there, which is
what's shown. 

00:29:35.233 --> 00:29:38.633
So that's the locus of that odd

00:29:38.633 --> 00:29:41.333
electron in the free radical. 

00:29:41.333 --> 00:29:44.833
If we have 5 pi electrons, the
fifth, the one that's in a 

00:29:44.833 --> 00:29:47.533
pair, is in those three
positions. 

00:29:47.533 --> 00:29:50.367
Now suppose we're interested in
the cation with five P 

00:29:50.367 --> 00:29:52.767
orbitals in a row. 

00:29:52.767 --> 00:29:55.333
So what we're going to do is
just take that electron out. 

00:29:55.333 --> 00:29:56.967
And where we take it out is now
going to 

00:29:56.967 --> 00:29:58.700
be a positive charge. 

00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:03.333
So that's the same as if we put
another electron in, in 

00:30:03.333 --> 00:30:05.700
the anion, that would be the
locus of the negative charge. 

00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:08.400
And in the cation, the locus of
the positive charge. 

00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:10.900
And that's the same thing we'd
get by drawing resonance 

00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:14.300
structures that show those same
positions having charges 

00:30:14.300 --> 00:30:17.100
or free radicals in them. 

00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:20.000
So those are the positions of
positive charge. 

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:24.433
And we get the same thing
drawing resonance pictures. 

00:30:24.433 --> 00:30:30.133
Now consider the influence on
rate of substituting not 

00:30:30.133 --> 00:30:33.633
benzene, but a benzene that
already has 

00:30:33.633 --> 00:30:37.067
some X group on it. 

00:30:37.067 --> 00:30:39.533
Now, a very common thing to have
studied with this was 

00:30:39.533 --> 00:30:42.867
nitration, because it's such an
easy reaction to do. 

00:30:42.867 --> 00:30:46.167
It's a very vigorous reagent,
NO2+. 

00:30:46.167 --> 00:30:48.267
You make it by just having a
mixture of nitric 

00:30:48.267 --> 00:30:49.900
and sulfuric acid. 

00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:53.567
You see how you get NO2+ from
that mixture? 

00:30:53.567 --> 00:30:54.667
It's quite simple. 

00:30:54.667 --> 00:30:58.533
You get a proton from sulfuric
acid, and it protonates the 

00:30:58.533 --> 00:31:01.533
OH, and then you lose water. 

00:31:01.533 --> 00:31:03.233
So you've got NO2+. 

00:31:03.233 --> 00:31:06.400
So it could be the thing that
comes in and then a proton 

00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:08.433
comes off from the same
position, and you've got the 

00:31:08.433 --> 00:31:09.333
substitution. 

00:31:09.333 --> 00:31:11.567
But now, when you have X in
there, you can get three 

00:31:11.567 --> 00:31:12.833
different isomers. 

00:31:12.833 --> 00:31:16.967
Ortho, meta, and para, they're
called. 

00:31:16.967 --> 00:31:20.033
Notice, incidentally, that NO2+
is an interesting 

00:31:20.033 --> 00:31:23.733
molecule because it's exactly
the same as CO2, except it 

00:31:23.733 --> 00:31:28.300
has one more proton in the
nucleus of the central atom. 

00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:29.833
Nitrogen instead of carbon. 

00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:39.567
So CO2 has a pair of electrons
in that double bond, a pair of 

00:31:39.567 --> 00:31:43.433
electrons on the oxygen that are
in the y orbitals, 

00:31:43.433 --> 00:31:44.833
pointing up and down. 

00:31:44.833 --> 00:31:49.867
It's also got x orbitals coming
in and out that have 

00:31:49.867 --> 00:31:50.733
the same kind of thing. 

00:31:50.733 --> 00:31:55.333
But if we consider just the y
orbitals, that'll be the LUMO. 

00:31:55.333 --> 00:31:57.700
There are two pairs of
electrons, so the one with no 

00:31:57.700 --> 00:32:00.167
nodes has two electrons, the one
with one 

00:32:00.167 --> 00:32:01.833
node has two electrons. 

00:32:01.833 --> 00:32:05.067
This is the one with two nodes,
no electronics. 

00:32:05.067 --> 00:32:08.633
So that's the vacant orbital,
the LUMO of NO2+ 

00:32:08.633 --> 00:32:09.900
just like CO2. 

00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:15.900
So NO2+- attacks, and we can
measure the rate. 

00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:18.567
Now what we're going to do to
measure the rate--we could do 

00:32:18.567 --> 00:32:21.733
careful work with a stopwatch
and so on, but there's a 

00:32:21.733 --> 00:32:23.267
clever way to do it. 

00:32:23.267 --> 00:32:28.067
Which is to compare two
molecules by doing them both. 

00:32:28.067 --> 00:32:31.600
Put both in there, and do the
reaction for just a little 

00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:33.467
while and then kill it. 

00:32:33.467 --> 00:32:36.300
If you add base, you won't have
the strong acid and the 

00:32:36.300 --> 00:32:37.367
reaction will stop. 

00:32:37.367 --> 00:32:41.933
And now see how much of each one
becomes product. 

00:32:41.933 --> 00:32:43.800
So we get relative rates that
way. 

00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:47.400
So we're doing relative rates
compared to hydrogen being 1, 

00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:50.933
that is, benzene when X is
hydrogen. 

00:32:50.933 --> 00:32:55.000
If X is methyl, it's 25 times
faster. 

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:59.233
That is, if you have 25 times as
much benzene as toluene-- 

00:32:59.233 --> 00:33:01.867
the one with methyl on it--
you'll get equal amounts of 

00:33:01.867 --> 00:33:03.933
the products at first, until
you've 

00:33:03.933 --> 00:33:05.500
used up all the toluene. 

00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:06.867
So it's 25 times faster. 

00:33:06.867 --> 00:33:08.567
So methyl helps the reaction. 

00:33:08.567 --> 00:33:12.600
OH really helps it, if you use
phenol it's 1,000 times faster 

00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:15.567
at getting the sum of all the
products. 

00:33:15.567 --> 00:33:17.700
Now why are those so fast? 

00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:22.333
Because electron donation eases
the formation of the 

00:33:22.333 --> 00:33:24.433
carbon cation intermediates. 

00:33:24.433 --> 00:33:28.700
Or, looked at a different way,
the carbon cations are stable 

00:33:28.700 --> 00:33:31.167
because there are other
electrons that become 

00:33:31.167 --> 00:33:33.200
stabilized when you get a cation
there. 

00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:35.233
For example, the unshared pair
on oxygen. 

00:33:39.867 --> 00:33:41.667
OK, now that's because we have
positive 

00:33:41.667 --> 00:33:44.467
charge at those locations. 

00:33:44.467 --> 00:33:47.867
When X is there, that helps out.

00:33:47.867 --> 00:33:52.100
Now if you put NO2 as X, so it's
already there, then it's 

00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:56.067
6 times 10-(-8), it's 10- (-7),
10 

00:33:56.067 --> 00:33:57.500
million times slower. 

00:34:00.367 --> 00:34:03.633
And the same if you have
trimethyl ammonium with its 

00:34:03.633 --> 00:34:05.000
positive charge. 

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.900
You don't want to make those
cations if there's another 

00:34:07.900 --> 00:34:11.900
cation there, or if there's an
NO2 group there. 

00:34:11.900 --> 00:34:14.500
So those are electron
withdrawing, and they retard 

00:34:14.500 --> 00:34:16.833
the formation of cation
intermediates. 

00:34:16.833 --> 00:34:20.267
The most interesting, as many
times, is the halogen. 

00:34:20.267 --> 00:34:26.100
The halogen is slower than
benzene, but not much slower. 

00:34:26.100 --> 00:34:29.200
Only 30 times slower. 

00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:32.733
And that's because both things
are happening with halogen. 

00:34:32.733 --> 00:34:37.000
It's withdrawing electrons in
the simga bond, but it has an 

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:39.267
unshared pair that donates back,
so 

00:34:39.267 --> 00:34:41.133
that it mostly cancels. 

00:34:46.167 --> 00:34:50.233
Why is NO2 electron withdrawing
when OH is 

00:34:50.233 --> 00:34:51.700
electron donating? 

00:34:51.700 --> 00:34:55.533
O is more electron negative than
nitrogen, so you might 

00:34:55.533 --> 00:34:59.667
think that OH should be more
electron withdrawing. 

00:34:59.667 --> 00:35:03.433
An unshared pair on nitrogen is
higher energy than the 

00:35:03.433 --> 00:35:05.033
unshared pair on oxygen 

00:35:05.033 --> 00:35:06.933
should be more electron
donating. 

00:35:06.933 --> 00:35:10.467
So this seems, at first glance,
to be sort of nuts, 

00:35:10.467 --> 00:35:15.333
that OH is 1,000 times faster
and NO2 is 10 

00:35:15.333 --> 00:35:16.900
million times slower. 

00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:18.933
But it's pretty easy to
understand when you look at 

00:35:18.933 --> 00:35:20.200
the orbitals that are involved.

00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:23.933
So in that case of oxygen,
there's this unshared pair on 

00:35:23.933 --> 00:35:28.533
the oxygen, which can overlap
with the p orbitals on the 

00:35:28.533 --> 00:35:30.667
benzene ring. 

00:35:30.667 --> 00:35:34.800
It turns out, indeed, that the
energy of the oxygen unshared 

00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:37.467
pair is about the same as pi
electrons of a 

00:35:37.467 --> 00:35:39.800
carbon-carbon bond. 

00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:45.067
So that the unshared pair on
oxygen has about  that energy, 

00:35:45.067 --> 00:35:48.467
about -1 on the scale we're
talking about here. 

00:35:48.467 --> 00:35:52.867
OK, so that's unusually high, as
pi are, unusually high. 

00:35:52.867 --> 00:35:58.467
So when you have a vacant
orbital next door, those 

00:35:58.467 --> 00:36:00.633
electrons get stabilized. 

00:36:00.633 --> 00:36:03.433
So it's a high HOMO, a good
overlap with phenyl, and 

00:36:03.433 --> 00:36:08.333
therefore OH can donate its
unshared pair. 

00:36:08.333 --> 00:36:09.367
OK, that's good. 

00:36:09.367 --> 00:36:10.633
How about NO2? 

00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:15.167
Notice that NO2 is allylic. 

00:36:15.167 --> 00:36:17.100
It's got three p orbitals on
each 

00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:20.333
oxygen and on the nitrogen. 

00:36:20.333 --> 00:36:23.900
So it's going to have a low
occupied molecular orbital 

00:36:23.900 --> 00:36:27.533
that gives good overlap with
phenyl. 

00:36:27.533 --> 00:36:31.833
So that one is able to donate
electrons because it has good 

00:36:31.833 --> 00:36:35.000
overlap, but it's not willing to
share its electrons. 

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.367
Its electrons are very low in
energy. 

00:36:37.367 --> 00:36:40.433
They're not going to be much
stabilized by having a vacant 

00:36:40.433 --> 00:36:41.400
orbital next door. 

00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:43.533
So you're not going to get
anything out of that, 

00:36:43.533 --> 00:36:44.567
from the low one. 

00:36:44.567 --> 00:36:48.233
The next orbital of the NO2
allylic system has a node in 

00:36:48.233 --> 00:36:49.100
the middle. 

00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:50.800
That one. 

00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:55.000
That one has the energy shown in
yellow there, it's going to 

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:56.733
be very good. 

00:36:56.733 --> 00:36:58.333
It's got a good, high HOMO. 

00:36:58.333 --> 00:37:02.633
As high as the p orbital on
oxygen, so it should be good 

00:37:02.633 --> 00:37:05.333
at donating electrons, at having
its electrons 

00:37:05.333 --> 00:37:09.433
stabilized by the vacant orbital
in the benzene ring. 

00:37:09.433 --> 00:37:11.133
But it's not, why not? 

00:37:11.133 --> 00:37:13.833
Can you see? 

00:37:13.833 --> 00:37:17.767
Why doesn't this orbital be
stabilized by mixing with 

00:37:17.767 --> 00:37:21.233
orbitals that are on the benzene
ring? 

00:37:21.233 --> 00:37:22.900
Because there's no overlap. 

00:37:22.900 --> 00:37:25.600
It doesn't have any size where
it's adjacent 

00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:27.300
to the benzene ring. 

00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:31.400
So it has no overlap, so it's
willing to give its electrons, 

00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:34.033
but it's not able because
there's no overlap. 

00:37:34.033 --> 00:37:36.367
And finally, you have the third
of the allylic 

00:37:36.367 --> 00:37:38.133
orbitals, that one. 

00:37:38.133 --> 00:37:40.667
Which is a low LUMO. 

00:37:40.667 --> 00:37:43.600
And it has good overlap with
phenyl. 

00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:48.133
So it withdraws electrons, it's
willing to take electrons 

00:37:48.133 --> 00:37:50.967
because it's unusually low, and
it has overlap so it's 

00:37:50.967 --> 00:37:52.800
able to accept electrons. 

00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:56.400
So that's why nitro is electron
withdrawing when OH 

00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:57.667
is electron donating. 

00:37:57.667 --> 00:38:00.533
it's because of that node in the
middle that makes it 

00:38:00.533 --> 00:38:04.100
unable to give electrons to the
benzene ring. 

00:38:04.100 --> 00:38:09.533
So NO2 is a pi accepter, whereas
OH is a pi donor. 

00:38:09.533 --> 00:38:13.167
OK now, we just looked at the
rates of these reactions, of 

00:38:13.167 --> 00:38:15.467
forming all three products
together. 

00:38:15.467 --> 00:38:18.133
But we might be interested in
the individual products, 

00:38:18.133 --> 00:38:20.033
ortho, meta, and para. 

00:38:20.033 --> 00:38:21.267
So let's look at that. 

00:38:21.267 --> 00:38:25.267
In the case of hydrogen, we'll
call each of these 1. 

00:38:25.267 --> 00:38:28.267
And now we'll do mixtures of
hydrogen with others-- 

00:38:28.267 --> 00:38:31.533
but now we'll analyze the ones
that already have an X in 

00:38:31.533 --> 00:38:34.900
them-- we'll analyze whether
it's orth, meta, or para, and 

00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:36.367
how much of each one. 

00:38:36.367 --> 00:38:40.233
Now if it's methyl, you see that
two of them are very fast 

00:38:40.233 --> 00:38:43.467
but one of them is not fast,
compared to what it was when 

00:38:43.467 --> 00:38:45.267
only hydrogen is on the ring. 

00:38:45.267 --> 00:38:48.333
How do you understand the two
that are fast? 

00:38:48.333 --> 00:38:51.700
Why are those fast when X is
methyl? 

00:38:59.333 --> 00:39:01.333
Linda, do you have an idea? 

00:39:01.333 --> 00:39:06.533
When X up here is methyl, this
is good and this is good. 

00:39:06.533 --> 00:39:08.333
39 and 46. 

00:39:08.333 --> 00:39:11.933
But this one is not any better.

00:39:11.933 --> 00:39:15.800
Methyl wants to be where the
cation is. 

00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:19.167
So it's especially good here,
and especially good here. 

00:39:19.167 --> 00:39:19.933
But not here. 

00:39:19.933 --> 00:39:21.767
There are only hydrogens here,
here, and here. 

00:39:21.767 --> 00:39:23.800
And it has the same rate as
hydrogen. 

00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:25.333
OK, that's fine. 

00:39:25.333 --> 00:39:32.400
If you look at t-butyl, now
again it's fast over here. 

00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:36.067
But it's not fast here. 

00:39:36.067 --> 00:39:40.433
So why don't you get this
product when you have the R 

00:39:40.433 --> 00:39:42.033
group here, when it's t-butyl? 

00:39:42.033 --> 00:39:43.367
You get it when you have methyl,
but 

00:39:43.367 --> 00:39:44.933
not when it's t-butyl. 

00:39:44.933 --> 00:39:46.333
Nathan, you got an idea? 

00:39:46.333 --> 00:39:47.400
STUDENT: Steric hindrance. 

00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:49.000
PROFESSOR: It's steric
hindrance, it's too big. 

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:50.933
It's hard to put this extra
group here when you have 

00:39:50.933 --> 00:39:52.833
something big there already. 

00:39:52.833 --> 00:39:54.067
OK, so that's good. 

00:39:58.267 --> 00:40:01.267
Now there are two things about a
substituent, X. Does it make 

00:40:01.267 --> 00:40:04.467
it go faster, or does it make it
go slower, is it activating 

00:40:04.467 --> 00:40:06.733
or deactivating? 

00:40:06.733 --> 00:40:09.633
So it's activating, these are
faster than benzene. 

00:40:09.633 --> 00:40:12.867
And how is it directing, what
does it direct? 

00:40:12.867 --> 00:40:16.000
Its ortho and para, for the
reason we saw. 

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:19.833
Except that in the t-butyl case,
it's not very much ortho 

00:40:19.833 --> 00:40:23.233
because of steric hindrance, as
Nathan told us. 

00:40:23.233 --> 00:40:26.267
OK, so those are electron
donating, and like to be 

00:40:26.267 --> 00:40:29.500
ortho/para, other things being
equal. 

00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:34.200
Now here's one that's the same
size as that neopentyl...

00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:35.400
or t-butyl group,

00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:38.700
the carbon with three methyls on
it. 

00:40:38.700 --> 00:40:41.133
But notice it's very much
slower. 

00:40:41.133 --> 00:40:42.600
And we saw that before. 

00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:46.633
But it's selectively slower,
it's slowed much more here-- 

00:40:46.633 --> 00:40:49.533
0.6 times 10-(-8) than it is
here...

00:40:49.533 --> 00:40:51.467
3 times 10-(-8). 

00:40:51.467 --> 00:40:54.967
So it's slow to get product, but
when you get product this 

00:40:54.967 --> 00:40:56.867
is the one you get. 

00:40:56.867 --> 00:40:57.600
Meta. 

00:40:57.600 --> 00:40:59.400
You don't get ortho and para. 

00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:01.267
Especially you don't get ortho
because 

00:41:01.267 --> 00:41:03.333
it's sterically hindered. 

00:41:03.333 --> 00:41:04.767
But you see, that's the same
thing. 

00:41:04.767 --> 00:41:08.833
If you want to form these things
when X has a plus 

00:41:08.833 --> 00:41:13.167
charge, don't put it here and
don't put it here. 

00:41:13.167 --> 00:41:14.633
If you're going to do it, put it
there. 

00:41:14.633 --> 00:41:16.633
Make it as far away as possible.

00:41:16.633 --> 00:41:18.633
So that's meta. 

00:41:18.633 --> 00:41:20.733
And the same thing is true of
nitro. 

00:41:20.733 --> 00:41:23.633
It's slowed down everywhere. 

00:41:23.633 --> 00:41:27.100
But it's not nearly as slowed
down meta as it is here-- it's 

00:41:27.100 --> 00:41:33.667
slowed 10 times more here for
ortho and whatever--

00:41:33.667 --> 00:41:35.500
300 times, right?

00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:40.133
Yeah, 300 times slower when it's
para. 

00:41:40.133 --> 00:41:42.400
And if you have an ester group,
the same 

00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:44.433
kind of thing is true. 

00:41:44.433 --> 00:41:48.067
Here it's 10 times slower here
than here, and twice slower 

00:41:48.067 --> 00:41:50.833
here than there. 

00:41:50.833 --> 00:41:53.900
So those are deactivating, for
the reasons we talked about 

00:41:53.900 --> 00:41:56.600
before, and they're meta
directing. 

00:41:56.600 --> 00:41:58.700
But again, halogen, is
especially interesting. 

00:42:02.333 --> 00:42:08.233
Notice it's slowed down, it's
deactivating, but it's 

00:42:08.233 --> 00:42:10.200
ortho/para directing. 

00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:12.933
So it shows both these
characters, deactivating and 

00:42:12.933 --> 00:42:13.867
ortho/para. 

00:42:13.867 --> 00:42:14.833
Why? 

00:42:14.833 --> 00:42:16.933
It's deactivating because of the
electron 

00:42:16.933 --> 00:42:19.267
withdrawal, which is sigma. 

00:42:19.267 --> 00:42:22.133
But if you're going to make it,
at least make it where the 

00:42:22.133 --> 00:42:27.167
halogen's unshared pair can be
stabilized by the vacant 

00:42:27.167 --> 00:42:28.433
orbital next door. 

00:42:32.967 --> 00:42:36.267
Now, how can you make the
reaction work better, the 

00:42:36.267 --> 00:42:37.633
electrophilic substitution? 

00:42:37.633 --> 00:42:39.900
You can make the electrophile
better. 

00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:44.867
So C+ would be a great
nucleophile,

00:42:44.867 --> 00:42:46.267
but you don't buy Cl+,

00:42:46.267 --> 00:42:48.267
you have Cl2. 

00:42:48.267 --> 00:42:53.200
So what's the low LUMO here, in
Cl2? 

00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:58.000
I've asked this maybe 15 times
before in lecture.

00:42:58.000 --> 00:42:58.600
STUDENT: Sigma* 

00:42:58.600 --> 00:43:00.767
PROFESSOR: Sigma*, OK. 

00:43:00.767 --> 00:43:02.967
But it's not nearly as low as
Cl+. 

00:43:02.967 --> 00:43:06.533
One way to make it better is to
treat it with a Lewis-acid 

00:43:06.533 --> 00:43:11.400
catalyst, like AlCl3, which has
a vacant orbital on 

00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:14.367
aluminum, which can attack an
unshared pair on the 

00:43:14.367 --> 00:43:16.500
chlorine like that. 

00:43:16.500 --> 00:43:19.600
And now you have a minus formal
charge on the aluminum 

00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:21.033
and plus on the chlorine. 

00:43:21.033 --> 00:43:23.200
It's a better leaving group. 

00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:24.767
So now you can do it better. 

00:43:24.767 --> 00:43:27.800
So Cl2 won't be nearly as
reactive as AlCl5. 

00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:33.233
Here, we can compare their LUMOs
and see it's essentially 

00:43:33.233 --> 00:43:34.567
the same LUMO. 

00:43:34.567 --> 00:43:38.067
But it's lower in the case of
AlCl5, so we can do this 

00:43:38.067 --> 00:43:40.833
reaction and it'll behave as if
it were Cl+. 

00:43:40.833 --> 00:43:47.667
If you look at the surface
charge, 0.29 positive there-- or

00:43:47.667 --> 00:43:52.033
29 there, and 38 on the one with
AlCl3. 

00:43:52.033 --> 00:43:54.633
So it's a better electrophile. 

00:43:54.633 --> 00:43:58.500
So adding a Lewis acid makes
these things work better. 

00:43:58.500 --> 00:44:01.700
So the leaving group is then
AlCl4-, 

00:44:01.700 --> 00:44:04.133
rather than Cl-. 

00:44:04.133 --> 00:44:07.933
And remember before when we said
that the rate of addition 

00:44:07.933 --> 00:44:12.833
to alkenes of bromine is, in
some solvents, is second order 

00:44:12.833 --> 00:44:13.833
in bromine. 

00:44:13.833 --> 00:44:16.733
Because that second bromine
molecule makes the leaving 

00:44:16.733 --> 00:44:19.733
group Br3-, rather than Br-. 

00:44:19.733 --> 00:44:24.167
It makes the reaction better,
exactly the same idea here. 

00:44:24.167 --> 00:44:26.833
Another way to make the reaction
better is to activate 

00:44:26.833 --> 00:44:28.167
the nucleophile. 

00:44:28.167 --> 00:44:31.433
So salicylic acid, which was
studied by Kolbe the same 

00:44:31.433 --> 00:44:36.633
guy who excoriated van't Hoff
about stereochemistry 

00:44:36.633 --> 00:44:39.000
invented a way to make salicylic
acid. 

00:44:41.967 --> 00:44:45.567
So you start with phenol, you
react it with CO2, which has 

00:44:45.567 --> 00:44:47.633
that vacant orbital we talked
about, like 

00:44:47.633 --> 00:44:49.433
the one in NO2+. 

00:44:49.433 --> 00:44:51.633
So you could imagine that
reaction. 

00:44:51.633 --> 00:44:55.300
Just like NO2+, except that CO2
isn't nearly as low 

00:44:55.300 --> 00:44:58.700
as NO2 plus with its extra
proton. 

00:44:58.700 --> 00:45:02.200
But you can make the nucleophile
better. 

00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:04.200
In the previous slide, we saw
making the 

00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:06.733
electrophile better. 

00:45:06.733 --> 00:45:09.533
So here we have the unshared
pair on oxygen, 

00:45:09.533 --> 00:45:11.000
which helps us out. 

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:15.733
But we can make it ever so much
better by putting base in 

00:45:15.733 --> 00:45:18.833
and making it a higher unshared
pair. 

00:45:18.833 --> 00:45:22.200
Now you have a big push to do
it, and you get salicylic 

00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:25.700
acid, which where aspirin comes
from, from 

00:45:25.700 --> 00:45:28.600
putting CO2 on phenol. 

00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:32.067
Now you could imagine the same
thing for NH2. 

00:45:32.067 --> 00:45:35.000
It's a higher unshared pair than
the 

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:37.900
one on oxygen, normally. 

00:45:37.900 --> 00:45:40.367
So it would do this pushing too,
and you 

00:45:40.367 --> 00:45:43.433
could nitrate aniline 

00:45:43.433 --> 00:45:44.333
aminobenzene, it's called 

00:45:44.333 --> 00:45:46.300
aniline. 

00:45:46.300 --> 00:45:49.633
And in fact, this was the
proposed and, in fact, used in 

00:45:49.633 --> 00:45:52.367
1944 as a rocket fuel 

00:45:52.367 --> 00:45:54.333
a mixture of nitric acid and
aniline. 

00:45:54.333 --> 00:45:57.767
And there's a little story I'm
going to tell here about a 

00:45:57.767 --> 00:46:00.367
good friend of mine, Dennis
Tanner, who was a professor 

00:46:00.367 --> 00:46:02.500
for many years at the University
of Alberta. 

00:46:02.500 --> 00:46:05.567
But when he was a post-doc, he
was at Stanford. 

00:46:05.567 --> 00:46:07.433
And he's a very hard worker. 

00:46:07.433 --> 00:46:10.300
And he was working in the lab on
the Fourth of July. 

00:46:10.300 --> 00:46:13.100
Not many people were working on
the Fourth of July, but 

00:46:13.100 --> 00:46:15.267
several people were, and they
passed each other in the hall, 

00:46:15.267 --> 00:46:17.633
and they decided they should
have some fun, too. 

00:46:17.633 --> 00:46:20.200
So they decided that each person
would put on a display 

00:46:20.200 --> 00:46:21.967
out in the parking lot. 

00:46:21.967 --> 00:46:27.333
So Dennis had heard about this
being a self-igniting rocket 

00:46:27.333 --> 00:46:29.700
fuel, so he thought it would be
fun to mix to nitrate 

00:46:29.700 --> 00:46:31.833
aniline, to do the nitration of
aniline. 

00:46:31.833 --> 00:46:35.667
So he got concentrated nitric
acid and put it in a beaker, 

00:46:35.667 --> 00:46:38.400
and he got aniline and put it in
a separatory funnel and 

00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:39.867
hung it above the beaker. 

00:46:39.867 --> 00:46:42.800
And he crouched down and grabbed
the thing and twisted 

00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:44.433
it, and started to run. 

00:46:44.433 --> 00:46:47.967
But the instant it hit, before
he got more than two paces, 

00:46:47.967 --> 00:46:52.933
there was an enormous fireball
that burned off his eyebrows. 

00:46:52.933 --> 00:46:57.100
So indeed, this is a very, very
active nitration 

00:46:57.100 --> 00:47:01.133
reaction, as Dennis proved. 

00:47:01.133 --> 00:47:05.100
But you can tame it. if you put
an acetyl group on the 

00:47:05.100 --> 00:47:08.533
aniline, then you lower the
energy of the unshared pair. 

00:47:08.533 --> 00:47:12.967
The pi* of the carbonyl mixes
with it and lowers it. 

00:47:12.967 --> 00:47:16.033
Now you don't have so much of a
push anymore. 

00:47:16.033 --> 00:47:19.200
And now, the nitration still
takes place. 

00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:22.733
It's still ortho/para directing,
but it doesn't burn 

00:47:22.733 --> 00:47:25.467
your eyebrows off. 

00:47:25.467 --> 00:47:28.067
So the acetylation of aniline
makes this nitration 

00:47:28.067 --> 00:47:29.033
controllable. 

00:47:29.033 --> 00:47:33.067
So you can start with aniline,
react it with acetyl chloride 

00:47:33.067 --> 00:47:36.500
and pyridine, which is often
used as a catalyst for putting 

00:47:36.500 --> 00:47:40.300
acetyl groups on, and we'll talk
about that later. 

00:47:40.300 --> 00:47:43.267
And now you can do the
nitration. 

00:47:43.267 --> 00:47:47.833
And you see it's ortho/para
directing, not meta directing. 

00:47:47.833 --> 00:47:51.067
So the unshared pair is still
doing its work, but not as 

00:47:51.067 --> 00:47:53.967
dramatically, as in Dennis's
case. 

00:47:53.967 --> 00:47:56.567
But then if you really wanted to
do the nitration of 

00:47:56.567 --> 00:48:00.100
aniline, now you take the acetyl
group back off again. 

00:48:00.100 --> 00:48:04.333
So you have the product, so you
tamed the nitration. 

00:48:04.333 --> 00:48:07.467
Now I just want to introduce the
biographical part of this, 

00:48:07.467 --> 00:48:10.067
and we'll talk about the rest of
it next time. 

00:48:10.067 --> 00:48:13.233
So the Friedel-Crafts reaction
is one of the most important 

00:48:13.233 --> 00:48:15.067
electrophilic substitution
reactions. 

00:48:15.067 --> 00:48:16.833
In fact, it's one of the most
important reactions 

00:48:16.833 --> 00:48:17.733
altogether. 

00:48:17.733 --> 00:48:19.700
And it was named after Charles
Friedel 

00:48:19.700 --> 00:48:21.433
and James Mason Crafts. 

00:48:21.433 --> 00:48:23.433
Friedel was a Frenchman. 

00:48:23.433 --> 00:48:25.133
Notice he's seven years older
than 

00:48:25.133 --> 00:48:26.733
Crafts, who was an American. 

00:48:26.733 --> 00:48:30.467
So this is a great example of
where America stood in 

00:48:30.467 --> 00:48:36.200
international science in the
last part of the 19th century. 

00:48:36.200 --> 00:48:39.833
So these are the publications of
James Mason Crafts from 

00:48:39.833 --> 00:48:47.267
1862, when he was a student,
until 1915 when he died. 

00:48:47.267 --> 00:48:50.867
So some of his papers were on
organic chemistry, and they 

00:48:50.867 --> 00:48:53.133
didn't have Friedel as a
co-author. 

00:48:53.133 --> 00:48:55.267
And at different ages, 

00:48:55.267 --> 00:48:58.600
he published a number as a
student there, as you'll see. 

00:48:58.600 --> 00:49:01.767
But then kept publishing. 

00:49:01.767 --> 00:49:03.900
Now here's his trajectory. 

00:49:03.900 --> 00:49:08.267
He was born in Boston, he
studied at Harvard. 

00:49:11.333 --> 00:49:13.900
But then to learn real science,
he went to Europe. 

00:49:13.900 --> 00:49:16.400
First he went to Germany for
just a short period. 

00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:18.567
He worked with Bunsen, actually.

00:49:18.567 --> 00:49:21.167
Then he went to France and
worked with Wurtz, the 

00:49:21.167 --> 00:49:23.400
successor of Dumas. 

00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:26.433
And he stayed there for four
years. 

00:49:26.433 --> 00:49:29.767
And then he came back, he
actually inspected mines in 

00:49:29.767 --> 00:49:32.267
Mexico for a year-- 

00:49:32.267 --> 00:49:33.467
and California. 

00:49:33.467 --> 00:49:34.800
Then he went to Cornell-- 

00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:35.967
which had just been founded-- 

00:49:35.967 --> 00:49:38.367
to be the chemistry professor
for a couple of years. 

00:49:38.367 --> 00:49:41.267
Then he went to MIT. 

00:49:41.267 --> 00:49:45.633
And then he was ill, but also
tired of not doing research. 

00:49:45.633 --> 00:49:47.333
And he went back to Paris. 

00:49:47.333 --> 00:49:49.833
He went back for just two years,
but he 

00:49:49.833 --> 00:49:52.233
stayed for 17 years. 

00:49:52.233 --> 00:49:55.100
And now he was working with his
pal, Friedel, whom he'd 

00:49:55.100 --> 00:49:57.900
met as a student in Wurtz's lab.

00:49:57.900 --> 00:50:01.333
Then he came back to MIT and, in
fact, he was president of 

00:50:01.333 --> 00:50:05.200
MIT for two years around 1900. 

00:50:05.200 --> 00:50:08.167
Now here are his papers that are
not organic chemistry. 

00:50:08.167 --> 00:50:10.867
They're about thermometry, about
physical chemistry. 

00:50:10.867 --> 00:50:13.667
And notice he did most of the
publication during this second 

00:50:13.667 --> 00:50:16.600
period in Paris when he was
doing only research. 

00:50:16.600 --> 00:50:20.233
But if you look at his papers
with Friedel, there are an 

00:50:20.233 --> 00:50:21.267
enormous number. 

00:50:21.267 --> 00:50:23.533
During this period--when he
was in America,

00:50:23.533 --> 00:50:26.100
he published almost nothing.

00:50:26.100 --> 00:50:28.933
When he was in Paris, he
published a lot, both as a 

00:50:28.933 --> 00:50:31.833
student when he started working
with Friedel, and 

00:50:31.833 --> 00:50:35.100
especially after he came back in
these 17 years. 

00:50:35.100 --> 00:50:38.800
So he published 100 papers
during these years, 99 papers 

00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:39.867
during those years. 

00:50:39.867 --> 00:50:42.600
So it wasn't possible to do the
kind of research in this 

00:50:42.600 --> 00:50:45.600
country that you could do over
there. 

00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:52.833
And then in 1877, just after he
had gone back to recover 

00:50:52.833 --> 00:50:57.133
and work with his pal Friedel at
the School of Mines, they 

00:50:57.133 --> 00:50:59.867
published a really important
paper and most of those red 

00:50:59.867 --> 00:51:02.300
publications after that are
about this 

00:51:02.300 --> 00:51:04.367
Friedel Crafts reaction. 

00:51:04.367 --> 00:51:07.200
And they got into it because
they had been students 

00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:09.000
together working with Wurtz. 

00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:11.733
And we'll talk about this then
next time.

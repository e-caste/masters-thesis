00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:08.691
Prof: Last time then we
talked about the cantos of

00:00:08.691 --> 00:00:09.720
pride.
 

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.728
We introduced the cantos of
pride: X, XI,

00:00:13.728 --> 00:00:14.730
and XII.
 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:23.923
I was arguing that Dante comes
to know and understand the

00:00:23.923 --> 00:00:31.640
virtues and vices of pride and
its opposite,

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.009
humility, which he sees
featured--humility he sees

00:00:35.009 --> 00:00:39.410
featured in Canto X and pride
he'll see punished in Canto XII.

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:44.957
He gets to understand the
nature of this virtue and this

00:00:44.957 --> 00:00:48.690
vice by looking at the work of
art.

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.843
So that in Canto X,
we already have a sort of

00:00:53.843 --> 00:01:00.518
representation of what an
aesthetic education can turn out

00:01:00.518 --> 00:01:01.689
to be.
 

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:07.840
How do we look at art and what
are we likely to learn from it?

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.218
This was the argument.
 

00:01:09.218 --> 00:01:14.501
Dante arrives into Purgatory
proper and the first image that

00:01:14.501 --> 00:01:19.964
uses to give us a sense of the
dimensions of this place is the

00:01:19.964 --> 00:01:22.830
figure of the human measure.
 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:29.497
He measures the world around
him through the dimensions of

00:01:29.497 --> 00:01:31.720
the human figure.
 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.815
Obliquely, it's not quite--we
are not quite there yet to that

00:01:36.815 --> 00:01:40.492
point,
but he's warning us that indeed

00:01:40.492 --> 00:01:44.259
the issue--
what is the issue about pride

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:48.540
and about humility really is--
what is the man's measure?

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.379
We are--he says that he's going
to--

00:01:51.379 --> 00:01:56.072
that the place is measured
according to the size of human

00:01:56.072 --> 00:01:59.018
beings,
but then the question is what

00:01:59.018 --> 00:02:02.433
is the measure of human beings
in a moral sense,

00:02:02.433 --> 00:02:03.379
of course.
 

00:02:03.379 --> 00:02:10.950
Since pride,
superbia in Italian and

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:22.310
in Latin, is a sin of excessive
love of one's own excellence.

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.897
The sense that one isn't quite
reducible to what perhaps others

00:02:27.897 --> 00:02:29.250
see about us.
 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.378
The idea that there may be a
touch of vanity in the way we

00:02:33.378 --> 00:02:37.145
judge and view ourselves,
the way in which we measure

00:02:37.145 --> 00:02:38.160
ourselves.
 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.720
Humility, on the other hand,
is the opposite--

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:48.071
is the remedy to pride and it
is really a virtue in that it

00:02:48.071 --> 00:02:52.852
really reduces us to--
reminds us of the fact that we

00:02:52.852 --> 00:02:54.000
are earthbound.
 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.275
That's the meaning of the word,
and by the way,

00:02:57.275 --> 00:03:01.332
that's exactly how humility and
the etymology of human are

00:03:01.332 --> 00:03:02.330
connected.
 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.473
They're both derived from a
common root, a common matrix in

00:03:06.473 --> 00:03:10.258
humus which is the Latin
word for the earth.

00:03:10.258 --> 00:03:12.769
We are called humans,
homo,

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:16.952
because we come out of the
earth, because we are made of

00:03:16.952 --> 00:03:21.060
the clay of the earth,
and we return to the earth.

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.288
That's the other implication.
 

00:03:23.288 --> 00:03:26.222
On the other hand,
humility is the virtue that

00:03:26.222 --> 00:03:30.262
reminds us that we really should
not view ourselves as all that

00:03:30.262 --> 00:03:31.110
elevated.
 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.538
So these are the issues.
 

00:03:33.538 --> 00:03:38.568
Dante then confronts some
scenes of humility.

00:03:38.568 --> 00:03:42.327
He begins with the virtues,
and the sins of humility--the

00:03:42.327 --> 00:03:46.419
virtue of humility are all taken
from the three histories that

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:47.560
interest him.
 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:53.209
He's always placing himself at
the confluence of these three

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:55.220
strains of history.
 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:58.453
An image from the Old
Testament, David,

00:03:58.453 --> 00:04:03.048
who dances in front of the ark,
therefore he humiliates

00:04:03.048 --> 00:04:04.068
himself.
 

00:04:04.068 --> 00:04:08.169
He tells us that he's more and
less than king.

00:04:08.169 --> 00:04:11.530
By the way, this phrase
"more and less,"

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.959
this lack of precision is
really an expression that

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:16.399
pervades Canto X.
 

00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:20.307
This "more and less,"
the grief is "more"

00:04:20.307 --> 00:04:21.870
than I can take,
etc.;

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.665
it appears in a variety of
forms, at least five times in

00:04:26.665 --> 00:04:29.019
the context of the canto.
 

00:04:29.019 --> 00:04:32.632
Next to David,
and that image of humility from

00:04:32.632 --> 00:04:36.906
the Old Testament,
and above him actually,

00:04:36.906 --> 00:04:43.432
watching down from the balcony
of a high tower in the royal

00:04:43.432 --> 00:04:46.420
palace,
there is his wife Michal,

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:48.170
who looks down at David.
 

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:51.711
Not only she looks down at
David, she obviously has

00:04:51.711 --> 00:04:56.161
contempt for him,
because in her view he is

00:04:56.161 --> 00:04:58.810
humiliating,
he's offending,

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:02.420
violating the principle of
decorum of what a king ought to

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.800
be.
 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.872
She has a different
understanding of what is the

00:05:05.872 --> 00:05:09.666
measure of a king and the place
of a king, because pride is

00:05:09.666 --> 00:05:11.759
exactly a question of place.
 

00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:15.750
What place do I occupy in the
world around me?

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:20.826
Am I where I think I would like
to be or am I where somebody

00:05:20.826 --> 00:05:24.439
else is placing me through
his/her gaze?

00:05:24.439 --> 00:05:27.939
The second image is an image
of--but they're all--

00:05:27.939 --> 00:05:31.930
you'll notice the little
detail, they're all placed

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:35.297
above,
they're sculptures placed above

00:05:35.297 --> 00:05:38.644
the normal sight,
so that there is obvious

00:05:38.644 --> 00:05:42.310
reversal now in what the value
of humility can be.

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:44.430
There is the story of the
Annunciation,

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:47.790
the angel Gabriel who descends,
literally,

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:52.120
and that descent is a story of
humiliation of the divine,

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:56.281
the divine enters history,
and therefore in that sense the

00:05:56.281 --> 00:05:58.399
divine is truly omnipotent.
 

00:05:58.399 --> 00:06:01.360
There is the idea which is
really something developed,

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:04.610
I mention it here,
but I will come back to that,

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:08.678
the idea that the divine is
detached from the human would

00:06:08.678 --> 00:06:11.149
make the divine less omniscient.
 

00:06:11.149 --> 00:06:14.745
A divine that does not know the
human, does not know death,

00:06:14.745 --> 00:06:16.730
cannot claim to be omniscient.
 

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:18.579
That's an argument that Dante
uses.

00:06:18.579 --> 00:06:22.827
So there is the story of the
angel Gabriel who comes down and

00:06:22.827 --> 00:06:25.517
the obedience of Mary,
the Virgin Mary,

00:06:25.517 --> 00:06:28.278
who says, 'Yes,
I am your servant.'

00:06:28.278 --> 00:06:33.891
So there's a story of--and Mary
is the one who said to turn the

00:06:33.891 --> 00:06:38.600
key between the old alliance and
the new alliance.

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:41.190
She reverses the story of Eve.
 

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:45.331
It is as if her obedience is a
response to some kind of

00:06:45.331 --> 00:06:49.702
violation and the promise of
being divine in the eating of

00:06:49.702 --> 00:06:50.699
the tree.
 

00:06:50.699 --> 00:06:55.928
The third example,
or story, that the pilgrim

00:06:55.928 --> 00:06:58.733
sees--
looks at--it's the story of the

00:06:58.733 --> 00:07:01.427
emperor Trajan,
secular history,

00:07:01.427 --> 00:07:07.720
who stops his--from marching
onto his campaign into Dacia,

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:10.514
into Romania,
in order to give justice to a

00:07:10.514 --> 00:07:12.990
little widow,
the diminutive is Dante's.

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:16.394
A little widow who has been
asking for justice before he

00:07:16.394 --> 00:07:19.120
departs, justice for the death
of her son.

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:22.682
This is what he--what Dante is
confronted with and what he is

00:07:22.682 --> 00:07:25.889
confronted with is we do know
that he's being asked and

00:07:25.889 --> 00:07:28.920
directed by Virgil to look at
the whole scene,

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:33.170
not to stop at one detail,
to even move beyond Virgil

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:35.732
himself,
in what would appear to be a

00:07:35.732 --> 00:07:38.940
transgression of the reverential
bond that ties them.

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:44.187
He--Dante is always following
as a disciple follows the

00:07:44.187 --> 00:07:45.160
teacher.
 

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:48.860
So he just even transgresses
his place but that doesn't seem

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:52.437
to have anything to do with the
aesthetic education of the

00:07:52.437 --> 00:07:53.190
pilgrim.
 

00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:58.666
He's witnessing what he calls
visible speech,

00:07:58.666 --> 00:08:00.410
synesthesia.
 

00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:03.925
That's why this phrase it says,
visibile parlare,

00:08:03.925 --> 00:08:05.778
in Italian, visible speech.
 

00:08:05.778 --> 00:08:11.430
It's a synesthesia that
combines the sight to sensory

00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:15.670
experiences, the eye and the
hearing;

00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:20.603
so speech because this is God's
art and God's art has also a

00:08:20.603 --> 00:08:22.110
precise meaning.
 

00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:26.714
A precise meaning that Dante
has no difficulty understanding

00:08:26.714 --> 00:08:30.540
or finding delight in,
so this is the argument.

00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:33.958
At one point,
in the drama of the canto,

00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:39.044
some figures keep appearing and
Virgil directs Dante's eyes

00:08:39.044 --> 00:08:42.639
toward the people that are
appearing.

00:08:42.639 --> 00:08:45.558
Dante does not recognize them.
 

00:08:45.558 --> 00:08:46.960
He says, I don't know what they
are.

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:49.279
My sight is so confused.
 

00:08:49.279 --> 00:08:52.740
He doesn't want to even know
who they are or what they are.

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:57.394
Virgil will explain to him they
are human figures crawling on

00:08:57.394 --> 00:09:00.808
the huge boulders and almost
moving like,

00:09:00.808 --> 00:09:04.548
on the ground,
on the earth like worms on the

00:09:04.548 --> 00:09:05.230
earth.
 

00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:10.573
And Dante is not really capable
of deciphering them or having

00:09:10.573 --> 00:09:12.889
even sympathy with them.
 

00:09:12.889 --> 00:09:14.298
At that point,
as you recall,

00:09:14.298 --> 00:09:17.115
because I had the feeling that
maybe the explanation is a

00:09:17.115 --> 00:09:20.625
little bit--
was a little bit too wriggly,

00:09:20.625 --> 00:09:24.725
but Dante's poem--
canto moves in that way with a

00:09:24.725 --> 00:09:26.740
lot of sinuosities there.
 

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:31.136
I mentioned to you a particular
passage in Chapter II--Book III,

00:09:31.136 --> 00:09:33.860
Chapter II of the
Confessions.

00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:38.447
It's an extraordinary passage
and I brought it in so that you

00:09:38.447 --> 00:09:41.889
can--I want to read a little bit
from that.

00:09:41.889 --> 00:09:48.562
It's a passage--it's a book
where Augustine is living in

00:09:48.562 --> 00:09:51.110
Carthage, you know.
 

00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:54.470
At about now,
at this stage he's about 17,

00:09:54.470 --> 00:10:01.450
19--has been talking about his
attraction for shows,

00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:05.399
his attractions for the
Manicheans,

00:10:05.399 --> 00:10:10.428
the distaste for scripture that
he has,

00:10:10.428 --> 00:10:14.961
and how he is going to be--has
been led astray by some of his

00:10:14.961 --> 00:10:19.842
friends with the stealing of--
gratuitous stealing of the pear

00:10:19.842 --> 00:10:22.308
tree--
the pears from the pear tree,

00:10:22.308 --> 00:10:25.928
which he doesn't understand why
he would ever do that.

00:10:25.928 --> 00:10:30.519
And now he talks about once
again his experience of the

00:10:30.519 --> 00:10:31.370
theatre.
 

00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:34.609
That is to say,
he's discussing his experience

00:10:34.609 --> 00:10:38.423
of himself as a spectator,
which is exactly what Dante

00:10:38.423 --> 00:10:39.000
was.
 

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.485
Dante--the problem Dante in
Canto X of Purgatorio is

00:10:43.485 --> 00:10:47.428
that he is at first a spectator
of works of art,

00:10:47.428 --> 00:10:50.408
which he seems to have no
difficulty understanding.

00:10:50.408 --> 00:10:53.447
Then he has to be
involved--show them at least

00:10:53.447 --> 00:10:57.191
some compassion,
some self-recognition with the

00:10:57.191 --> 00:11:01.860
souls who are these shades,
penitents, who are under these

00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:05.690
huge weights that they carry,
and he cannot do it.

00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:10.509
He still has to learn what
grief is and what is it,

00:11:10.509 --> 00:11:16.389
and how do you go on connecting
to the images that you see.

00:11:16.389 --> 00:11:18.610
Let's see how--what Augustine
says,

00:11:18.610 --> 00:11:23.912
Augustine is--that's what he
says: "Stage plays,"

00:11:23.912 --> 00:11:27.658
this is really Chapter II of
Book III,

00:11:27.658 --> 00:11:30.428
"stage plays carried me
away,

00:11:30.428 --> 00:11:35.840
full of images of my miseries,
and a fuel to my fire.

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:41.090
Why is it that man desires to
be made sad?

00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:46.222
Beholding doleful and tragical
things which he himself would by

00:11:46.222 --> 00:11:48.210
no means suffer."
 

00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:51.506
The real pleasure of his going
to the theatre,

00:11:51.506 --> 00:11:55.537
he claims, we have a great
pleasure, is in the images of

00:11:55.537 --> 00:11:56.269
grief.
 

00:11:56.269 --> 00:11:59.636
They don't really touch us,
we are not even expected to

00:11:59.636 --> 00:12:03.628
jump on the stage to relieve the
characters were involved in this

00:12:03.628 --> 00:12:05.000
sort of situation.
 

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.500
He goes on, and then you'll see
what the point is,

00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:10.080
"which would himself by no
means suffer,

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:14.538
yet he desires as a spectator
to feel sorrow at them,

00:12:14.538 --> 00:12:17.830
and this very sorrow is his
pleasure."

00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:19.158
I was just paraphrasing that.
 

00:12:19.158 --> 00:12:22.368
"What is this,
but a miserable madness,

00:12:22.368 --> 00:12:26.100
for a man is the more affected
with his actions.

00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:30.234
The less free he is from such
affections, however,

00:12:30.234 --> 00:12:34.791
when he suffers in his own
person, it uses to be styled

00:12:34.791 --> 00:12:35.720
misery.
 

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:39.798
When he feels compassion for
others, then it is mercy.

00:12:39.798 --> 00:12:44.538
What sort of compassion is this
for feigned and scenic passions?

00:12:44.538 --> 00:12:48.269
For the auditor is not called
on to relieve,

00:12:48.269 --> 00:12:52.346
but only to grieve,
and he applauds the actor of

00:12:52.346 --> 00:12:55.730
these fictions the more he
grieves.

00:12:55.730 --> 00:12:58.998
And if the calamities of those
persons were of all times or

00:12:58.998 --> 00:13:01.485
mere fiction,
to be so acted that the

00:13:01.485 --> 00:13:05.480
spectator is not moved to tears,
he goes away disgusted and

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:07.850
criticizing,
but if he is to be moved to

00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:11.176
passion,
he stays intent and weeps for

00:13:11.176 --> 00:13:12.230
joy."
 

00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:14.878
This is an extraordinary
passage, I think,

00:13:14.878 --> 00:13:18.753
in the history of antiquity and
the criticism of the theatre,

00:13:18.753 --> 00:13:20.110
dramatic theatre.
 

00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:24.207
The point is,
can we ever be disengaged

00:13:24.207 --> 00:13:25.610
spectators?
 

00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:29.753
Yes, we can be disengaged
spectators and Augustine is

00:13:29.753 --> 00:13:32.940
criticizing the disengaged
spectator,

00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:37.624
the belief that we can be in
front of the play of the world

00:13:37.624 --> 00:13:41.687
and that things only touch us,
as if in a fiction,

00:13:41.687 --> 00:13:46.028
and yet we ourselves are not
going to be able to acknowledge

00:13:46.028 --> 00:13:46.470
it.
 

00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:50.464
He's really criticizing the
limits of the theatre,

00:13:50.464 --> 00:13:54.538
the limits of that kind of
aesthetic experience.

00:13:54.538 --> 00:13:59.524
I think that Dante is picking
up exactly from this--what

00:13:59.524 --> 00:14:04.144
Augustine says in this chapter,
and he's showing how

00:14:04.144 --> 00:14:07.678
unavoidably one has to be
involved.

00:14:07.678 --> 00:14:11.253
There's--in the measure in
which we think that we are not

00:14:11.253 --> 00:14:13.548
touched by somebody else's
grief,

00:14:13.548 --> 00:14:17.370
we're really admitting the
overpowering quality of that

00:14:17.370 --> 00:14:18.289
experience.
 

00:14:18.289 --> 00:14:19.210
That's his argument.
 

00:14:19.210 --> 00:14:24.048
He has learned something then;
he has learned that there is no

00:14:24.048 --> 00:14:26.870
such a thing as a safe
perspective.

00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:31.480
The way--and he has learned
what Michal had been doing in--

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:34.870
from the high window of her
palace,

00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:40.711
that she was expressing disgust
at her husband because that

00:14:40.711 --> 00:14:44.639
offends her own sense of
superiority.

00:14:44.639 --> 00:14:49.504
Dante says, I may be no
different from Michal in my

00:14:49.504 --> 00:14:55.145
disclaimer that I do not know
and I do not see any of these

00:14:55.145 --> 00:14:59.330
penitents who disfigure the
human form.

00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:03.268
In refusing to acknowledge that
they are like me,

00:15:03.268 --> 00:15:07.780
and refusing to have any
self-recognition between me and

00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:08.519
them.
 

00:15:08.519 --> 00:15:11.278
This is really the aesthetic
education.

00:15:11.278 --> 00:15:15.899
Let's see now how for Dante it
is aesthetic and it's ethical.

00:15:15.899 --> 00:15:20.945
He goes on understanding that
the stakes are in the idea of

00:15:20.945 --> 00:15:25.505
perspective,
the idea that the world is a

00:15:25.505 --> 00:15:31.437
projection of my own wishes and
that world is really

00:15:31.437 --> 00:15:33.298
reformulated.
 

00:15:33.298 --> 00:15:36.509
If I think that I can take a
safe distance,

00:15:36.509 --> 00:15:40.408
it's because I do not want to
look within myself.

00:15:40.408 --> 00:15:43.859
Canto XI and Canto XII,
I think, will answer that

00:15:43.859 --> 00:15:44.649
question.
 

00:15:44.649 --> 00:15:47.706
Let me just go on with Canto
XII--Canto XI,

00:15:47.706 --> 00:15:48.580
I'm sorry.
 

00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:51.658
First of all--if there are
questions you can interrupt me,

00:15:51.658 --> 00:15:54.769
because I don't think this is a
difficult argument,

00:15:54.769 --> 00:15:58.480
but if there are questions
interrupt me now or keep them

00:15:58.480 --> 00:15:59.288
for later.
 

00:15:59.288 --> 00:16:04.309
Canto XI begins with the
penitents, who now change,

00:16:04.309 --> 00:16:06.519
reverse perspective.
 

00:16:06.519 --> 00:16:11.471
They are so close to the
ground, but they are looking up,

00:16:11.471 --> 00:16:16.249
and they have the Lord's
Prayer, in what is Dante's own

00:16:16.249 --> 00:16:19.610
recasting of the canonical
prayer.

00:16:19.610 --> 00:16:22.013
"Our Father,
which art in heaven,

00:16:22.013 --> 00:16:25.780
not circumscribed but by the
greater love Thou hast for Thy

00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:27.730
first works on high."
 

00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:30.370
This is the prayer of the
penitents.

00:16:30.370 --> 00:16:34.739
"Praise be Thy name and
power by every creature as it is

00:16:34.739 --> 00:16:38.090
meet to give thanks for Thy
sweet effluence;

00:16:38.090 --> 00:16:41.461
May Thy peace of Thy kingdom
come to us, for we cannot reach

00:16:41.461 --> 00:16:43.232
it of ourselves,
if it come not,

00:16:43.232 --> 00:16:44.720
with all our striving.
 

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:48.269
As Thine angels make sacrifice
to Thee of their will,

00:16:48.269 --> 00:16:51.408
singing hosannas,
so let men make of theirs;

00:16:51.408 --> 00:16:55.259
Give us this day the daily
manna, without which he goes

00:16:55.259 --> 00:16:59.254
backward through this harsh
wilderness who most labors to

00:16:59.254 --> 00:17:01.912
advance;
And as we forgive everyone the

00:17:01.912 --> 00:17:04.675
wrong we have suffered,
do Thou also forgive in

00:17:04.675 --> 00:17:07.619
loving-kindness and look not on
our deserving;

00:17:07.619 --> 00:17:09.338
Our strengths," and so on.
 

00:17:09.338 --> 00:17:13.328
"Thus beseeching good
speed for themselves and for us

00:17:13.328 --> 00:17:16.410
those shades went beneath their
burden,"

00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:16.970
etc.
 

00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:21.318
What about this prayer?
 

00:17:21.318 --> 00:17:24.323
First of all,
how is this related to what we

00:17:24.323 --> 00:17:25.720
are talking about?
 

00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:29.642
The first thing is that in the
Lord's Prayer,

00:17:29.642 --> 00:17:34.634
the change Dante makes is to
emphasize that God is not in

00:17:34.634 --> 00:17:37.220
space, not circumscribed.
 

00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:41.528
God is not in space and
therefore He is really

00:17:41.528 --> 00:17:44.210
everywhere, or He is free.
 

00:17:44.210 --> 00:17:47.845
That formula he is using,
you may want to know,

00:17:47.845 --> 00:17:52.192
is a traditional one in
medieval thinking whereby God is

00:17:52.192 --> 00:17:54.880
said to be an infinite sphere.
 

00:17:54.880 --> 00:18:00.130
This is a formula to define
what--the idea of the infinity

00:18:00.130 --> 00:18:00.960
of God.
 

00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:05.411
An infinite sphere whose center
is everywhere and whose

00:18:05.411 --> 00:18:07.390
circumference nowhere.
 

00:18:07.390 --> 00:18:12.068
God is not in a place;
God does not have a perspective.

00:18:12.068 --> 00:18:16.115
There is--indirectly there is a
critique of perspective here,

00:18:16.115 --> 00:18:18.608
or the inadequacy of a
perspective.

00:18:18.608 --> 00:18:20.630
God is everywhere,
not circumscribed,

00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:22.088
that's the first change.
 

00:18:22.088 --> 00:18:23.970
The second change that he's
making,

00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:27.740
this is a neo-Platonic element
that he adds on to the Lord's

00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:30.367
Prayer,
and then the second one is that

00:18:30.367 --> 00:18:33.215
he literally places,
"Give us this day the

00:18:33.215 --> 00:18:35.559
daily manna,
without which he goes

00:18:35.559 --> 00:18:38.924
backwards,"
he literally makes the Lord's

00:18:38.924 --> 00:18:42.588
Prayer the prayer of the exiles
in the desert.

00:18:42.588 --> 00:18:47.568
Like the Jews in the wilderness
who ask and get their manna,

00:18:47.568 --> 00:18:50.358
so now this is another element
that--

00:18:50.358 --> 00:18:56.108
another metaphorical element
that casts Purgatory as a

00:18:56.108 --> 00:19:01.667
journey through the desert
between the bondage of Egypt and

00:19:01.667 --> 00:19:03.009
Jerusalem.
 

00:19:03.009 --> 00:19:07.369
The other point is that there
is a reversal of perspective

00:19:07.369 --> 00:19:11.960
somehow, and what kind of a
perspective is he gaining now?

00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:15.084
The perspective,
I think, is what I call a

00:19:15.084 --> 00:19:16.990
Franciscan perspective.
 

00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:19.903
Let me just explain first of
all, the line,

00:19:19.903 --> 00:19:23.371
"Praised be Thy name and
power by every living

00:19:23.371 --> 00:19:24.690
creature."
 

00:19:24.690 --> 00:19:28.990
This is literally an echo of
the first poem of the Italian

00:19:28.990 --> 00:19:31.857
poetic tradition,
a poem written by St.

00:19:31.857 --> 00:19:36.308
Francis, which is known as the
Canticle of Creatures,

00:19:36.308 --> 00:19:41.288
which is really a sequence--a
anaphoric sequence of praises.

00:19:41.288 --> 00:19:43.743
'Praised be Thy name,
praised be the water,

00:19:43.743 --> 00:19:45.029
praised'--and so on.
 

00:19:45.029 --> 00:19:50.362
The point of that poem is that
it begins with the look of human

00:19:50.362 --> 00:19:55.520
beings up to the highest and
then it ends up with the idea of

00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:56.640
humility.
 

00:19:56.640 --> 00:20:02.346
We are, Francis says,
"Not the most important or

00:20:02.346 --> 00:20:07.010
the center of creation,
we are like everything else

00:20:07.010 --> 00:20:08.890
valuable in creation."
 

00:20:08.890 --> 00:20:13.669
That's the thrust of the poem,
and the only way in which you

00:20:13.669 --> 00:20:18.204
can really understand the
creation is really to look from

00:20:18.204 --> 00:20:21.769
the bottom up and not from the
top down.

00:20:21.769 --> 00:20:26.986
This is the true,
the kind of perspective that he

00:20:26.986 --> 00:20:30.028
is describing in the poem.
 

00:20:30.028 --> 00:20:35.009
The rest of the canto really is
a connection between art and

00:20:35.009 --> 00:20:36.818
pride,
which we are not going to be

00:20:36.818 --> 00:20:39.678
surprised,
since the whole of Canto X was

00:20:39.678 --> 00:20:42.808
a reflection on the premises of
that--

00:20:42.808 --> 00:20:46.098
of the two metaphors,
art and pride.

00:20:46.098 --> 00:20:53.807
So you have the illuminators
and then references on lines 90

00:20:53.807 --> 00:20:58.575
to the painters,
"O empty glory of human

00:20:58.575 --> 00:21:01.398
powers,
how briefly last the green on

00:21:01.398 --> 00:21:04.317
its top,
unless it's followed by age of

00:21:04.317 --> 00:21:05.048
dullness!
 

00:21:05.048 --> 00:21:08.200
In painting Cimabue thought to
hold the field,

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:12.259
and now Giotto has the cry,
so that the other's fame is dim

00:21:12.259 --> 00:21:13.588
and so..."
 

00:21:13.588 --> 00:21:16.503
And then the poets,
Guido Cavalcanti and Guido

00:21:16.503 --> 00:21:20.519
Guinizelli: "So has the one
Guido taken from the other the

00:21:20.519 --> 00:21:24.067
glory of our tongue,
and he, perhaps is born that

00:21:24.067 --> 00:21:27.718
shall chase the one and the
other from the nest,"

00:21:27.718 --> 00:21:29.440
meaning Dante himself.
 

00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:33.180
The idea of fame,
which is what the proud souls

00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:38.353
may be looking for,
is here dismissed as having the

00:21:38.353 --> 00:21:43.952
inconsistency of the wind,
just vanishing like the breath,

00:21:43.952 --> 00:21:48.976
a breath of wind,
and so this is the sort of

00:21:48.976 --> 00:21:54.710
moral understanding of pride and
humility.

00:21:54.710 --> 00:21:57.351
In Canto XII,
I just want to show you and

00:21:57.351 --> 00:22:01.405
describe the reasons why,
and try to explain to you the

00:22:01.405 --> 00:22:05.818
reasons why Dante deploys a
peculiar rhetorical artifice.

00:22:05.818 --> 00:22:12.646
And I ask you to turn to around
lines 25 which is a sequence of

00:22:12.646 --> 00:22:15.288
new visions Dante has.
 

00:22:15.288 --> 00:22:18.680
This time the images are on the
ground.

00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:21.823
So he has to look down;
he doesn't have to look up,

00:22:21.823 --> 00:22:25.230
and they are images of the
proud souls who have been

00:22:25.230 --> 00:22:29.240
punished and therefore now they
appear now on the ground.

00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:31.942
The text starts,
"I saw him that I was

00:22:31.942 --> 00:22:34.773
created nobler than any other
creature,"

00:22:34.773 --> 00:22:37.220
now of course you know who he
is,

00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:39.567
"on the one side;
I saw Briareus,"

00:22:39.567 --> 00:22:42.134
one of the giants,
"pierced by the heavenly

00:22:42.134 --> 00:22:43.227
shaft, lying heavy..
 

00:22:43.227 --> 00:22:45.248
.I saw Thymbraeus,
I saw Pallas and...

00:22:45.248 --> 00:22:46.450
I saw Nimrod...
 

00:22:46.450 --> 00:22:50.400
" All figures you have
more or less seen before.

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:51.000
"...
 

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.203
at the foot of his mighty work,
as if bewildered,

00:22:54.203 --> 00:22:57.807
and he was looking at the
peoples in Shinar that shared

00:22:57.807 --> 00:22:59.210
his pride."
 

00:22:59.210 --> 00:23:01.863
And then four tercets:
"O Niobe..

00:23:01.863 --> 00:23:03.585
.", "O Saul...
 

00:23:03.585 --> 00:23:05.736
", "O mad Arachne...
 

00:23:05.736 --> 00:23:07.960
", "O Rehoboam...
 

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:11.462
" And then,
once again, the four more

00:23:11.462 --> 00:23:15.566
tercets: "It showed too,
that hard pavement,

00:23:15.566 --> 00:23:17.190
how Alcmaeon...
 

00:23:17.190 --> 00:23:19.746
It showed how his sons fell
upon Sennacherib...

00:23:19.746 --> 00:23:22.857
It showed the destruction and
the cruel butchery that the

00:23:22.857 --> 00:23:23.970
Tomyris wrought.
 

00:23:23.970 --> 00:23:24.133
...
 

00:23:24.133 --> 00:23:27.183
It showed how the Assyrians
fled in rout after Holofernes

00:23:27.183 --> 00:23:28.220
was slain."
 

00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:33.144
And then one final tercet:
"I saw Troy in ashes and

00:23:33.144 --> 00:23:35.836
in heaps;
O Ilion, how abased and vile

00:23:35.836 --> 00:23:38.640
the design show thee that we saw
there!"

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:43.795
These are all the figurations
of punished pride:

00:23:43.795 --> 00:23:48.950
pride that has been now
literally humiliated.

00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:52.202
I did have to ask you to look,
so that you can understand the

00:23:52.202 --> 00:23:52.798
artifice.
 

00:23:52.798 --> 00:23:58.714
This is what we call a visible
speech that Dante himself has

00:23:58.714 --> 00:24:02.329
been deploying,
and to do this I have to ask

00:24:02.329 --> 00:24:06.210
you to look at the Italian text
that begins with the word--

00:24:06.210 --> 00:24:11.299
every tercet with the letter V,
though I'm sure you would like

00:24:11.299 --> 00:24:15.722
me to read a little bit of the
Italian: Vedea colui

00:24:15.722 --> 00:24:16.557
che...
 

00:24:16.557 --> 00:24:20.896
, Vedea Brďareo,
the next tercet Vedea

00:24:20.896 --> 00:24:25.318
Timbreo, next Vedea
Nembrňt.

00:24:25.318 --> 00:24:29.492
And then, the four next tercets
with the letter O:

00:24:29.492 --> 00:24:32.219
O Niobč,
O Saůl,

00:24:32.219 --> 00:24:35.029
O folle Aragne,
O Roboam.

00:24:35.029 --> 00:24:38.138
And then the next four tercets
with M, Mostrava ancor..

00:24:38.138 --> 00:24:40.586
., next Mostrava come i
figli si gettaro..

00:24:40.586 --> 00:24:42.318
., Mostrava la ruina...
 

00:24:42.318 --> 00:24:46.114
You've got to read down,
Mostrava come in

00:24:46.114 --> 00:24:47.348
rotta...
 

00:24:47.348 --> 00:24:51.115
and then final tercet from line
61 to 62, Vedea Troia...

00:24:51.115 --> 00:24:52.086
o Ilion..
 

00:24:52.086 --> 00:24:53.910
mostrava il segno...
 

00:24:53.910 --> 00:24:59.516
which sort of recapitulates all
of the key elements of this

00:24:59.516 --> 00:25:00.578
artifice.
 

00:25:00.578 --> 00:25:05.118
We are in the presence of a
so-called acrostic that if you

00:25:05.118 --> 00:25:09.259
read from the top down,
it spells the following V-U-M

00:25:09.259 --> 00:25:11.410
and then recapitulates.
 

00:25:11.410 --> 00:25:14.809
This is the V,
but in Italian it's also the U.

00:25:14.809 --> 00:25:16.980
That is to say, the fall of man.
 

00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:20.760
So he's doing this--he's using
this artifice that you can only

00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:22.868
understand if you read the text.
 

00:25:22.868 --> 00:25:27.480
If you have to hear it,
you can't quite get to it.

00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:30.416
In other words,
he's doing two things,

00:25:30.416 --> 00:25:33.990
using God's own art as a model
for himself.

00:25:33.990 --> 00:25:38.358
This is pride,
it would seem to be pride.

00:25:38.358 --> 00:25:41.767
After all it's excessive love
of one's excellence,

00:25:41.767 --> 00:25:45.869
but God did that in Canto X,
he's going to do the same thing

00:25:45.869 --> 00:25:47.400
now with the text.
 

00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:51.413
The second thing that it shows
is that the text is not a text

00:25:51.413 --> 00:25:54.289
to be just heard,
it's a text to be read.

00:25:54.289 --> 00:25:57.250
It's a text to be looked at.
 

00:25:57.250 --> 00:26:00.480
It's what we call visible
speech.

00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:05.740
What is Dante doing in--is he
lapsing into a sin of pride?

00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:10.305
Of course, but what he's
telling us is that pride is not

00:26:10.305 --> 00:26:10.970
a sin.
 

00:26:10.970 --> 00:26:14.422
He is, in a sense,
redefining the ethical language

00:26:14.422 --> 00:26:18.154
of the Middle Ages and the
ethical language of his own

00:26:18.154 --> 00:26:18.788
text.
 

00:26:18.788 --> 00:26:23.071
He's saying that in the measure
in which you love what is above

00:26:23.071 --> 00:26:24.798
you, that is not a sin.
 

00:26:24.798 --> 00:26:30.038
The sin--it is a sin,
pride, in the measure in which

00:26:30.038 --> 00:26:36.410
you do have contempt for those
that you think are below you.

00:26:36.410 --> 00:26:40.809
We have, thanks to the world of
art, a re-evaluation of the

00:26:40.809 --> 00:26:42.098
moral language.
 

00:26:42.098 --> 00:26:46.084
That's the first and most
important example of all of this

00:26:46.084 --> 00:26:50.000
that happens throughout
Purgatory in Purgatory itself.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:53.779
Do you see what--is it--do you
want me to say this again?

00:26:53.779 --> 00:26:59.900
Dante, by imitating God's form
of art as he does here,

00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:03.830
with his own text,
he's drawing attention to this

00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:08.907
as an artifice available to us
thanks to his text and it's only

00:27:08.907 --> 00:27:14.150
possible to view it the way he
describes it within the text.

00:27:14.150 --> 00:27:17.440
He's giving a peculiar status
to his own text.

00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:23.240
This text has also its stages
and artifice that we normally--

00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:26.078
and he has learned from God
directly,

00:27:26.078 --> 00:27:29.759
which means that the sin of
Lucifer,

00:27:29.759 --> 00:27:32.837
even, is not just the sin that
he transgresses what's above

00:27:32.837 --> 00:27:35.681
him--
it's the sin because he has

00:27:35.681 --> 00:27:38.608
contempt for what is below him.
 

00:27:38.608 --> 00:27:43.223
So the humility and pride
really have to go hand in hand

00:27:43.223 --> 00:27:48.088
and one attenuates and changes
the meaning of the other.

00:27:48.088 --> 00:27:54.491
This is really something that
in many ways a Franciscan

00:27:54.491 --> 00:27:57.287
canto--
you might want to write a paper

00:27:57.287 --> 00:27:59.460
on that on the song of the so
called--

00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:02.325
the Song of All
Creatures by St.

00:28:02.325 --> 00:28:05.038
Francis and this particular
canto.

00:28:05.038 --> 00:28:09.275
And so you may draw your own
conclusions, if you do not agree

00:28:09.275 --> 00:28:10.970
with what I have said.
 

00:28:10.970 --> 00:28:15.838
Let's move on to the next few
cantos.

00:28:15.838 --> 00:28:19.962
I want to go to,
above all, to Canto XVI because

00:28:19.962 --> 00:28:25.401
here we have--we are approaching
now the center of the world of

00:28:25.401 --> 00:28:26.630
Purgatory.
 

00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:32.536
We are in the--we skipped envy
altogether and I will get back

00:28:32.536 --> 00:28:36.769
to that on another occasion in
Canto XV,

00:28:36.769 --> 00:28:40.868
but in XVI and XVII we'll talk
about anger,

00:28:40.868 --> 00:28:43.858
the sin of anger,
the purgation of anger.

00:28:43.858 --> 00:28:47.424
Here, in XVI,
Dante meets a famous

00:28:47.424 --> 00:28:54.232
magnanimous figure called Marco
Lombardo and he has a discussion

00:28:54.232 --> 00:28:57.268
about human--
he has a discussion with him

00:28:57.268 --> 00:29:00.647
about the so-called--
the issue of human degradation,

00:29:00.647 --> 00:29:02.298
of human degeneracy.
 

00:29:02.298 --> 00:29:05.970
The scene takes place in a kind
of--

00:29:05.970 --> 00:29:11.400
the cloud of anger,
the biblical cloud of anger,

00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:14.068
sort of a world deprived of any
light,

00:29:14.068 --> 00:29:15.998
a kind of madness,
if you wish,

00:29:15.998 --> 00:29:19.854
anger understood as that which
violates the clarity and light

00:29:19.854 --> 00:29:23.048
of reason that--
as we refer to it.

00:29:23.048 --> 00:29:27.268
"Gloom of Hell or night
bereft of every planet under a

00:29:27.268 --> 00:29:31.703
barren sky overcast everywhere
with cloud never made a veil to

00:29:31.703 --> 00:29:35.994
my sight so heavy or of a stuff
so harsh to the sense as the

00:29:35.994 --> 00:29:37.450
smoke..."
 

00:29:37.450 --> 00:29:39.938
And then the language:
"Just as a blind man goes

00:29:39.938 --> 00:29:42.760
behind his guide that he may not
stray or knock against what

00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:44.578
might injure or perhaps kill
him,

00:29:44.578 --> 00:29:47.962
so I went through the foul and
bitter air listening to my

00:29:47.962 --> 00:29:48.868
Leader."
 

00:29:48.868 --> 00:29:52.170
He meets then,
within this context,

00:29:52.170 --> 00:29:57.314
in this background of a
cloudiness and near blindness,

00:29:57.314 --> 00:30:01.778
near invisibility of the world
around him.

00:30:01.778 --> 00:30:05.683
The kind of invisibility that
has been carried over from the

00:30:05.683 --> 00:30:09.588
sin of envy, which as you know,
is all about being blind.

00:30:09.588 --> 00:30:19.078
Then he hears a voice and Dante
asks one question.

00:30:19.078 --> 00:30:23.794
The question is:
do we have the "world is..

00:30:23.794 --> 00:30:27.404
.wholly barren of every
virtue,"

00:30:27.404 --> 00:30:30.838
on line 55,
"as thou declarest to me,

00:30:30.838 --> 00:30:32.920
and pregnant and overspread
with wickedness,

00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:36.930
but I beg thee to point out to
me the cause that I may see it,

00:30:36.930 --> 00:30:39.536
and show it to men,
for one places it in the

00:30:39.536 --> 00:30:41.900
heavens and another here
below."

00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:45.230
Is there such a thing as free,
what we call free will?

00:30:45.230 --> 00:30:47.568
What is it, what is free will?
 

00:30:47.568 --> 00:30:53.130
What is the cause of all our
deeds of our doings?

00:30:53.130 --> 00:30:57.130
Is it--as the astrologers will
say, in the planets and

00:30:57.130 --> 00:31:00.827
therefore a matter of
determination by forces that

00:31:00.827 --> 00:31:04.298
transcend us and which we have
no control?

00:31:04.298 --> 00:31:08.423
A severe limitation of the
meaning of choices and the

00:31:08.423 --> 00:31:12.548
possibilities of choices,
and therefore of merits and

00:31:12.548 --> 00:31:13.578
demerits.
 

00:31:13.578 --> 00:31:17.190
If we have no choices,
then we can really--we cannot

00:31:17.190 --> 00:31:21.085
be praised or blamed for what we
do, or is it within us,

00:31:21.085 --> 00:31:23.278
and this is Marco Lombardo.
 

00:31:23.278 --> 00:31:28.078
It is a revisit--Dante's
revisiting the whole story of--

00:31:28.078 --> 00:31:32.454
and debate, an ancient debate
about the relationship between

00:31:32.454 --> 00:31:36.088
free will and God's
foreknowledge if you wish,

00:31:36.088 --> 00:31:38.798
that Boethius in The
Consolation of Philosophy,

00:31:38.798 --> 00:31:42.548
as is well known,
had been confronting.

00:31:42.548 --> 00:31:44.933
"He first heaved then a
deep sigh,"

00:31:44.933 --> 00:31:47.640
line 63 and following,
"which grief forced us to

00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:50.048
'Alas!',
then began: 'Brother..."

00:31:50.048 --> 00:31:52.807
I don't have to point out to
you, this is the form of

00:31:52.807 --> 00:31:54.608
salutation in Purgatorio.
 

00:31:54.608 --> 00:31:58.680
You already had "Our
Father" in Canto XI,

00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:01.950
with this idea that there's a
human family,

00:32:01.950 --> 00:32:06.167
therefore a brother is the
appropriate form of

00:32:06.167 --> 00:32:11.230
interlocution and address among
the souls and Dante.

00:32:11.230 --> 00:32:11.866
"..
 

00:32:11.866 --> 00:32:16.009
.the world is blind and indeed
thou comest from it.

00:32:16.009 --> 00:32:20.263
You that are living refer every
cause up to the heavens alone,

00:32:20.263 --> 00:32:24.308
just as if they moved all
things with them by necessity.

00:32:24.308 --> 00:32:27.298
If it were so,
free choice would be

00:32:27.298 --> 00:32:28.880
destroyed."
 

00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:30.430
I think the text is very clear.
 

00:32:30.430 --> 00:32:34.237
I would have to tell you that
there is a distinction between

00:32:34.237 --> 00:32:37.397
choice and free will,
they are not the same thing:

00:32:37.397 --> 00:32:39.269
free choice or free will.
 

00:32:39.269 --> 00:32:43.770
And this is a very difficult
argument because choice implies

00:32:43.770 --> 00:32:46.974
that we--that it's an
intellectual problem,

00:32:46.974 --> 00:32:50.180
that we choose thanks to what
we know.

00:32:50.180 --> 00:32:54.589
The will is a difficult
argument, because free will

00:32:54.589 --> 00:32:58.558
implies that the will is never
in bondage,

00:32:58.558 --> 00:33:02.960
and it's possible to attain the
moment where we will freely.

00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:06.933
In fact, so many theologians go
on asking that free will means

00:33:06.933 --> 00:33:10.712
that the will finally can be
moved by an act of choice that

00:33:10.712 --> 00:33:14.459
it is--
it follows on the prior act of

00:33:14.459 --> 00:33:15.568
knowledge.
 

00:33:15.568 --> 00:33:19.167
Dante uses the two terms:
"if it were so free choice

00:33:19.167 --> 00:33:22.894
would be destroyed in you and
there would be no justice and

00:33:22.894 --> 00:33:26.430
happiness for well doing and
misery for evil."

00:33:26.430 --> 00:33:30.588
That's the answer that Marco
Lombardo will give.

00:33:30.588 --> 00:33:32.328
"The heavens initiate your
impulses;

00:33:32.328 --> 00:33:35.020
I do not say all,
but, if I did,

00:33:35.020 --> 00:33:38.058
light is given on good and
evil,

00:33:38.058 --> 00:33:40.896
and free will,
and if it bear the strain in

00:33:40.896 --> 00:33:43.598
the first battlings with the
heavens,

00:33:43.598 --> 00:33:46.660
then, being rightly nurtured it
conquers all.

00:33:46.660 --> 00:33:49.759
To a greater power and to a
better nature you,

00:33:49.759 --> 00:33:51.548
free, are subject."
 

00:33:51.548 --> 00:33:55.483
Which in Italian it really is,
I have to say,

00:33:55.483 --> 00:33:58.881
more of an oxymoron,
line 80: liberi

00:33:58.881 --> 00:34:00.670
soggiaciete.
 

00:34:00.670 --> 00:34:05.525
You are free subjects exactly,
you are--and you can--you do

00:34:05.525 --> 00:34:10.800
sense the--you understand the
contradiction in the two terms.

00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:12.893
That is to say,
we are free,

00:34:12.893 --> 00:34:15.840
but at the same time we are
subject.

00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:18.882
I can only understand it
with--in terms of what Dante

00:34:18.882 --> 00:34:21.750
will say a little bit later when
he discusses--

00:34:21.750 --> 00:34:26.577
he shifts the argument to the
law, saying that that's really

00:34:26.577 --> 00:34:29.291
the--
we are free subjects and the

00:34:29.291 --> 00:34:32.724
law is exactly the--
the metaphor for him that will

00:34:32.724 --> 00:34:36.438
make us understand what it means
to be free and subject at the

00:34:36.438 --> 00:34:39.500
same time;
where limitations are going to

00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:43.739
be posited and within those
limitations we can be free.

00:34:43.739 --> 00:34:45.090
That's the argument.
 

00:34:45.090 --> 00:34:47.679
"And that creates the mind
in you which the heavens have

00:34:47.679 --> 00:34:48.630
not in their charge.
 

00:34:48.630 --> 00:34:49.940
Therefore..." etc.
 

00:34:49.940 --> 00:34:55.958
Then here the first thing that
Dante does is give a sense of

00:34:55.958 --> 00:34:57.079
creation.
 

00:34:57.079 --> 00:35:04.360
He posits human freedom in the
act of creation of the soul.

00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:09.929
This is, "from his
hand," lines 85,

00:35:09.929 --> 00:35:12.739
"from His hand,
who regards it fondly,

00:35:12.739 --> 00:35:14.400
before it is,
comes forth,

00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:17.786
like a child that sports,
tearful and smiling,

00:35:17.786 --> 00:35:21.530
the little simple soul that
knows nothing."

00:35:21.530 --> 00:35:25.393
This is the famous poem,
for those of you who remember a

00:35:25.393 --> 00:35:29.728
little bit of Latin,
Hadrian--of the emperor Hadrian

00:35:29.728 --> 00:35:34.815
about the little simple soul
that goes wandering around and

00:35:34.815 --> 00:35:40.077
Dante's reinterpreting it as not
the soul that is lost in the

00:35:40.077 --> 00:35:43.199
world,
but a soul that is playing.

00:35:43.199 --> 00:35:46.369
The creation is a playful act.
 

00:35:46.369 --> 00:35:51.070
The soul is a like "a
child that sports tearful and

00:35:51.070 --> 00:35:53.510
smiling,
the little simple soul that

00:35:53.510 --> 00:35:55.905
knows nothing,
but, moved by a joyful Maker

00:35:55.905 --> 00:35:58.110
turns eagerly to what delights
it."

00:35:58.110 --> 00:36:04.960
We have the idea of creation as
a free and playful act.

00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:08.864
Play in the sense of the
innocence of the experience and

00:36:08.864 --> 00:36:11.280
play in the sense of being free.
 

00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:14.250
Now when one is at play one has
all the attributes of

00:36:14.250 --> 00:36:16.650
spontaneity and freedom that go
with it.

00:36:16.650 --> 00:36:22.880
It is the basis of what I call
the playful theology of Dante.

00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:28.041
God creates the world in an
act--in a moment of freedom and

00:36:28.041 --> 00:36:32.936
that freedom becomes the
foundation for positing our own

00:36:32.936 --> 00:36:34.539
human freedom.
 

00:36:34.539 --> 00:36:40.648
It's because we were born free
that therefore we can go on

00:36:40.648 --> 00:36:46.329
believing and--that there is
such a freedom for us.

00:36:46.329 --> 00:36:48.230
That it was not an act of
necessity--

00:36:48.230 --> 00:36:50.784
that would be the opposite in
the moment of creation and the

00:36:50.784 --> 00:36:55.648
experience of creation--
but it's spontaneous and

00:36:55.648 --> 00:36:57.050
playful.
 

00:36:57.050 --> 00:37:00.974
Then the canto goes on with
these extraordinary political

00:37:00.974 --> 00:37:03.989
arguments, political and legal
arguments.

00:37:03.989 --> 00:37:08.152
So we talk about human freedom
and Dante moves to political

00:37:08.152 --> 00:37:11.599
freedom and look at what he
says: "Rome,

00:37:11.599 --> 00:37:14.503
which made the world good,
used to have two suns,"

00:37:14.503 --> 00:37:17.840
which is a kind of Baroque
image and I'll explain that too,

00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:20.309
in a moment,
why he uses this image,

00:37:20.309 --> 00:37:22.920
"which made plain the one
way and the other,

00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:24.710
that of the world and that of
God.

00:37:24.710 --> 00:37:28.344
The one has quenched the other
and the sword is joined to the

00:37:28.344 --> 00:37:30.360
crook,
and the one together with the

00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:32.541
other must perforce go ill,
since, joined,

00:37:32.541 --> 00:37:34.219
the one does not fear the
other.

00:37:34.219 --> 00:37:39.168
If thou dost not believe me
consider the ear of corn,"

00:37:39.168 --> 00:37:39.679
etc.
 

00:37:39.679 --> 00:37:41.159
What is he talking about?
 

00:37:41.159 --> 00:37:44.268
God has--Rome had two suns?
 

00:37:44.268 --> 00:37:48.489
The phrase translates--the line
mistranslates--

00:37:48.489 --> 00:37:53.818
deliberately mistranslates,
a line in Genesis where it is

00:37:53.818 --> 00:37:58.099
said that God gave mankind two
luminaries,

00:37:58.099 --> 00:38:02.360
the sun and the moon,
but whereby we could really see

00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:04.900
both in the day and at night.
 

00:38:04.900 --> 00:38:10.143
This little image from Genesis
was used by the so-called

00:38:10.143 --> 00:38:14.554
hierocrats,
the Canon lawyers of the middle

00:38:14.554 --> 00:38:18.333
ages,
to explain it as the emblem for

00:38:18.333 --> 00:38:21.018
the Empire and the Church.
 

00:38:21.018 --> 00:38:26.422
That the Empire--the sun having
the larger light the hierocrats

00:38:26.422 --> 00:38:29.762
would claim,
was the light of the Church,

00:38:29.762 --> 00:38:33.902
and the moon having a reflected
light was the light of the

00:38:33.902 --> 00:38:34.630
Empire.
 

00:38:34.630 --> 00:38:38.329
It was an argument,
they would use this gloss as a

00:38:38.329 --> 00:38:41.349
way of explaining the
superiority of--

00:38:41.349 --> 00:38:44.905
the Empire over--the
superiority of the Church over

00:38:44.905 --> 00:38:45.829
the Empire.
 

00:38:45.829 --> 00:38:49.985
The Empire had to take its
light and its direction from the

00:38:49.985 --> 00:38:50.630
Church.
 

00:38:50.630 --> 00:38:55.860
Dante is deliberately violating
that idea of the sun and the

00:38:55.860 --> 00:38:58.081
moon,
equating them by saying

00:38:58.081 --> 00:39:01.172
"the two suns,"
in order to convey his

00:39:01.172 --> 00:39:04.119
conviction,
the conviction that the two

00:39:04.119 --> 00:39:08.550
institutions God provides for
the guidance of human beings,

00:39:08.550 --> 00:39:11.820
the Church and the Empire,
are equal.

00:39:11.820 --> 00:39:15.527
He's conferring on them an
equality rather than a

00:39:15.527 --> 00:39:20.083
hierarchical ordering of the two
luminaries, the sun and the

00:39:20.083 --> 00:39:20.780
moon.
 

00:39:20.780 --> 00:39:25.608
It's an argument that really is
addressed against the lawyers at

00:39:25.608 --> 00:39:28.980
the University of Bologna where
they are--

00:39:28.980 --> 00:39:35.811
they were working for the pope,
explaining the sense of the

00:39:35.811 --> 00:39:41.188
superiority,
the superior status of one

00:39:41.188 --> 00:39:43.550
above the other.
 

00:39:43.550 --> 00:39:50.500
With this whole argument here,
now the--

00:39:50.500 --> 00:39:55.322
which is about a kind of
legality or the questions of

00:39:55.322 --> 00:39:59.143
history's boundaries,
that's what I understand by

00:39:59.143 --> 00:40:02.782
legalities,
you have retrospectively also

00:40:02.782 --> 00:40:08.826
some light shown on this claim
of being free subjects in Canto

00:40:08.826 --> 00:40:09.518
XVI.
 

00:40:09.518 --> 00:40:13.789
We turn now to the very center
of the Divine Comedy.

00:40:13.789 --> 00:40:14.969
The center of the Divine
Comedy,

00:40:14.969 --> 00:40:17.579
which is, clearly,
numerically the center,

00:40:17.579 --> 00:40:22.081
Canto XVII, and we'll see
how--what is it that Dante

00:40:22.081 --> 00:40:24.820
discusses here in Canto XVII.
 

00:40:24.820 --> 00:40:30.219
The canto--its visions of anger
of the--

00:40:30.219 --> 00:40:34.644
the canto begins with an
apostrophe to the reader's

00:40:34.644 --> 00:40:39.730
memory: "Recall reader,
if ever in the mountains mist

00:40:39.730 --> 00:40:44.329
caught thee for which thou
couldst not see except as moles

00:40:44.329 --> 00:40:48.768
do through the skin,"
the difficulty of sight,

00:40:48.768 --> 00:40:54.079
the difficulty of seeing is
highlighted again,

00:40:54.079 --> 00:40:57.418
"how, when the moist,
dense vapors begin to disperse,

00:40:57.418 --> 00:41:00.789
the sun's disk passes feebly
through them;

00:41:00.789 --> 00:41:04.324
and thy imagination will
quickly come to see how,

00:41:04.324 --> 00:41:08.300
at first, I saw the sun again,
now near its setting.

00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:10.880
So measuring mine with the
faithful steps of my master,

00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:15.067
I came forth from such a fog to
the beams which were already

00:41:15.067 --> 00:41:17.409
dead on the shores below."
 

00:41:17.409 --> 00:41:23.980
It's a twilight landscape;
you have a number of reversals

00:41:23.980 --> 00:41:27.369
and contrast--
antithesis actually the

00:41:27.369 --> 00:41:31.728
mole--blind mole,
that burrows underneath the

00:41:31.728 --> 00:41:37.583
earth and then alpine scenery
which makes vision also

00:41:37.583 --> 00:41:39.159
impossible.
 

00:41:39.159 --> 00:41:44.550
Dante's evoking the heights and
the lowest possible point of

00:41:44.550 --> 00:41:46.559
sight with the mole.
 

00:41:46.559 --> 00:41:50.510
The sun is setting and the
night is approaching.

00:41:50.510 --> 00:41:54.452
It is as if the whole--so the
solidity of the world around him

00:41:54.452 --> 00:41:56.519
is vanishing--is disappearing.
 

00:41:56.519 --> 00:41:58.190
What's the experience?
 

00:41:58.190 --> 00:42:02.300
At this very moment,
he's appealing to the memory of

00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:06.090
the reader and the imagination
of the reader.

00:42:06.090 --> 00:42:10.130
It is as if that when the world
outside seems to be failing us,

00:42:10.130 --> 00:42:13.010
we have this--part of this
inner light,

00:42:13.010 --> 00:42:17.206
this inner possibility of
recollection of the world or

00:42:17.206 --> 00:42:18.949
imagining the world.
 

00:42:18.949 --> 00:42:23.358
He's specifying what some of
the claims about the inner

00:42:23.358 --> 00:42:27.360
lights that he says we have
within us could be.

00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:29.429
He had just said that.
 

00:42:29.429 --> 00:42:33.503
Also he's preparing this
extraordinary second apostrophe

00:42:33.503 --> 00:42:35.059
to the imagination.
 

00:42:35.059 --> 00:42:39.364
Dante is--we are approaching
the center of the universe,

00:42:39.364 --> 00:42:43.356
this poetic universe,
and Dante reminds us that this

00:42:43.356 --> 00:42:45.940
is a work of the imagination.
 

00:42:45.940 --> 00:42:47.469
Why does he do this?
 

00:42:47.469 --> 00:42:50.289
What is this--what does he say
about the imagination?

00:42:50.289 --> 00:42:52.268
The first thing that he says
about the imagination:

00:42:52.268 --> 00:42:54.880
"O imagination,
which so steals us at times

00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:58.405
from outward things that we pay
no heed though a thousand

00:42:58.405 --> 00:43:03.114
trumpets sound about us,
who moves thee if the senses

00:43:03.114 --> 00:43:05.849
offer thee nothing?"
 

00:43:05.849 --> 00:43:10.545
It's the same question he had
been asking earlier:

00:43:10.545 --> 00:43:13.710
where do our choices come from?
 

00:43:13.710 --> 00:43:16.760
Why do we what we do?
 

00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:21.190
Is it because a power from the
outside moves us,

00:43:21.190 --> 00:43:25.150
or is there something that is
within us?

00:43:25.150 --> 00:43:28.954
Now this question is asked in
slightly different terms,

00:43:28.954 --> 00:43:31.070
in terms of the imagination.
 

00:43:31.070 --> 00:43:36.746
The imagination is a power,
that's what he--the way he

00:43:36.746 --> 00:43:42.639
describes it--that removes us
from the outside world.

00:43:42.639 --> 00:43:45.530
There's such a power--in other
words,

00:43:45.530 --> 00:43:49.284
it's not just the imagination
that translates sensory

00:43:49.284 --> 00:43:53.614
experiences into images for the
benefit of rational judgment:

00:43:53.614 --> 00:43:56.719
this is the triadic
Aristotelian order;

00:43:56.719 --> 00:44:00.360
the imagination has the middle
ground between the senses,

00:44:00.360 --> 00:44:03.739
the work of the perception and
the work of reason.

00:44:03.739 --> 00:44:09.130
This is a triadic pattern that
Dante could have found in

00:44:09.130 --> 00:44:10.797
Aquinas;
we, in turn,

00:44:10.797 --> 00:44:13.601
found it certainly in
Aristotle, that's the way it

00:44:13.601 --> 00:44:14.289
precedes.
 

00:44:14.289 --> 00:44:18.181
He has another imagination that
he's talking about now,

00:44:18.181 --> 00:44:22.219
an imagination that removes us
from the outside world.

00:44:22.219 --> 00:44:26.579
It frees us--it needs nothing
of the world of perception.

00:44:26.579 --> 00:44:29.115
It is a power that,
in many ways,

00:44:29.115 --> 00:44:32.920
steals us from it,
it's a power that--how does he

00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:34.190
describe it?
 

00:44:34.190 --> 00:44:37.317
It comes "from the outward
things that we pay no heed

00:44:37.317 --> 00:44:40.059
though a thousand trumpets sound
about us."

00:44:40.059 --> 00:44:43.936
It's a faculty that is
completely free from the outside

00:44:43.936 --> 00:44:48.172
world, a power that we have
within us to imagine worlds that

00:44:48.172 --> 00:44:49.679
don't even exist.
 

00:44:49.679 --> 00:44:53.858
To imagine things that without
the solicitations of what lies

00:44:53.858 --> 00:44:57.690
outside us and continues:
"a light moves thee which

00:44:57.690 --> 00:45:01.661
takes form in the heavens,
either of itself or by a will

00:45:01.661 --> 00:45:03.349
that directs it downwards.
 

00:45:03.349 --> 00:45:04.550
Of her impious deed..."
 

00:45:04.550 --> 00:45:08.449
and then he goes on describing
three images of anger.

00:45:08.449 --> 00:45:12.280
At the point in which Dante is
approaching the center of the--

00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:17.190
his world where this--where we
are witnessing,

00:45:17.190 --> 00:45:21.505
we are shown the power of the
imagination as a visionary

00:45:21.505 --> 00:45:22.289
faculty.
 

00:45:22.289 --> 00:45:27.494
As a faculty that is not a
transcription of the real world,

00:45:27.494 --> 00:45:32.518
and one wonders why he has to
make this kind of claim.

00:45:32.518 --> 00:45:39.148
It encompasses the real world
and yet is something that almost

00:45:39.148 --> 00:45:45.777
prophetic, something that does
not come from the contacts with

00:45:45.777 --> 00:45:47.300
the world.
 

00:45:47.300 --> 00:45:50.260
I'll come back to this in a
moment, I hope.

00:45:50.260 --> 00:45:53.264
He has three images,
then three--that come down to

00:45:53.264 --> 00:45:54.429
him gratuitously.
 

00:45:54.429 --> 00:46:01.027
They seem to have been
descending into his mind without

00:46:01.027 --> 00:46:07.380
anything that--around him and
then Dante goes on here

00:46:07.380 --> 00:46:11.780
describing the law of Purgatory.
 

00:46:11.780 --> 00:46:16.809
What is the world of Purgatory?
 

00:46:16.809 --> 00:46:18.099
How is it constructed?
 

00:46:18.099 --> 00:46:19.900
What's the architecture of this
world?

00:46:19.900 --> 00:46:23.659
Unsurprisingly,
this is a fabric of love,

00:46:23.659 --> 00:46:26.789
an architecture of love,
and it's at the very center,

00:46:26.789 --> 00:46:31.956
lines 91,92,
and 93--that this is the actual

00:46:31.956 --> 00:46:35.818
numerically even,
in the center the poem--not

00:46:35.818 --> 00:46:38.094
surprising,
that's what Dante says,

00:46:38.094 --> 00:46:40.630
"Neither Creator nor
creature,

00:46:40.630 --> 00:46:45.110
my son, was ever without love,
either natural or of the

00:46:45.110 --> 00:46:46.190
mind."
 

00:46:46.190 --> 00:46:47.268
That's the center.
 

00:46:47.268 --> 00:46:49.730
What does he mean natural or of
the mind?

00:46:49.730 --> 00:46:52.237
He's distinguishing here
between the two types of love

00:46:52.237 --> 00:46:53.942
and in fact he will clarify:
"..

00:46:53.942 --> 00:46:56.851
.and this thou knowest;
the natural is always without

00:46:56.851 --> 00:46:59.494
error," whatever impulse we
may have,"

00:46:59.494 --> 00:47:05.012
that's the impulse of love,
that is never prone to

00:47:05.012 --> 00:47:07.070
sinfulness.
 

00:47:07.070 --> 00:47:11.143
It's a natural impulse,
a natural desire,

00:47:11.143 --> 00:47:16.644
that which is instead sinful is
the one where choice is

00:47:16.644 --> 00:47:17.969
involved.
 

00:47:17.969 --> 00:47:19.835
"The natural is always
without error,

00:47:19.835 --> 00:47:22.610
but the other may err through a
wrong object or through excess

00:47:22.610 --> 00:47:23.929
or defect of vigor."
 

00:47:23.929 --> 00:47:27.750
Whenever we make a choice we
may either not love the right

00:47:27.750 --> 00:47:30.230
object or we may love it too
much,

00:47:30.230 --> 00:47:34.067
or we may love it too little,
and so this is the topography

00:47:34.067 --> 00:47:35.059
of Purgatory.
 

00:47:35.059 --> 00:47:38.420
This triadic division in terms
of love.

00:47:38.420 --> 00:47:42.947
Everything is a problem of love
but then there are varieties

00:47:42.947 --> 00:47:45.480
that organize its subdivisions.
 

00:47:45.480 --> 00:47:48.103
"While it is directed on
the primal good and on the

00:47:48.103 --> 00:47:50.726
secondary keeps right measure,
it cannot be the cause of

00:47:50.726 --> 00:47:53.447
sinful pleasure;
but when it is warped to evil,

00:47:53.447 --> 00:47:56.748
or with more or with less
concern than is due pursues its

00:47:56.748 --> 00:47:59.518
good against the Creator works
his creature.

00:47:59.518 --> 00:48:03.666
From this thou canst understand
that love must be the seed in

00:48:03.666 --> 00:48:08.018
you of every virtue and of every
action deserving punishment.

00:48:08.018 --> 00:48:12.106
Now since love can never turn
its face from the welfare of its

00:48:12.106 --> 00:48:15.322
subject all things are secure
from self hatred...

00:48:15.322 --> 00:48:16.730
" and so on.
 

00:48:16.730 --> 00:48:20.396
And Dante now responds:
"Now I would have thee

00:48:20.396 --> 00:48:24.135
give thought to the other,
which pursues its good in

00:48:24.135 --> 00:48:25.530
faulty measure.
 

00:48:25.530 --> 00:48:29.445
Everyone confusedly apprehends
the good at which the mind may

00:48:29.445 --> 00:48:33.396
be at rest and desires it,
so that each strives to reach

00:48:33.396 --> 00:48:37.652
it, and if the love is sluggish
that draws you to see or gain

00:48:37.652 --> 00:48:38.929
it,
this terrace,

00:48:38.929 --> 00:48:41.630
after due repentance,
torments you for that.

00:48:41.630 --> 00:48:43.590
Other good there is..."
 

00:48:43.590 --> 00:48:48.811
The question then will
become--and I did not ask you to

00:48:48.811 --> 00:48:54.592
read this canto,
but I can give you a sort of

00:48:54.592 --> 00:49:01.204
brief preview of it--
Dante has to ask if--what is

00:49:01.204 --> 00:49:03.840
this love of choice?
 

00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:08.429
Does it depend--since I may
have a particular perception of

00:49:08.429 --> 00:49:12.385
the world that makes me see
whatever I encounter as

00:49:12.385 --> 00:49:17.469
beautiful and desirable,
where is my fault?

00:49:17.469 --> 00:49:22.789
He repeats the same problems
that he's been raising in Canto

00:49:22.789 --> 00:49:23.239
XV.
 

00:49:23.239 --> 00:49:27.074
Dante will try to explain it in
terms of love,

00:49:27.074 --> 00:49:32.103
and yet, we are going to be
brought back to the world of how

00:49:32.103 --> 00:49:35.768
do we perceive what it is that
we love.

00:49:35.768 --> 00:49:40.782
The perception of what we love
becomes crucial to our very

00:49:40.782 --> 00:49:43.070
responsibilities for it.
 

00:49:43.070 --> 00:49:47.822
So this is--at the center of
the poem then Dante seems to be

00:49:47.822 --> 00:49:50.239
suspended between two ideas.
 

00:49:50.239 --> 00:49:53.929
On the one hand,
the notion that there is a real

00:49:53.929 --> 00:49:57.934
world where you have
responsibilities for everything

00:49:57.934 --> 00:50:00.920
that we do and on the other
hand,

00:50:00.920 --> 00:50:05.702
a world where there's an
imagination which is completely

00:50:05.702 --> 00:50:09.179
disengaged from the world of
reality,

00:50:09.179 --> 00:50:15.059
and cannot quite be constrained
or held in.

00:50:15.059 --> 00:50:19.237
So how are you going
to--suspended between these two

00:50:19.237 --> 00:50:24.070
possibilities--how is Dante
going to bring them together?

00:50:24.070 --> 00:50:27.199
You see what the issue is?
 

00:50:27.199 --> 00:50:32.059
How do you--if the world of the
imagination is free and

00:50:32.059 --> 00:50:35.570
disengaged from reality then how
am--

00:50:35.570 --> 00:50:37.536
I'm going to,
on the other hand,

00:50:37.536 --> 00:50:41.409
going to be held accountable
for what I do over the world,

00:50:41.409 --> 00:50:44.039
and with the world around me,
and with my own deeds.

00:50:44.039 --> 00:50:47.561
At the center of the poem
Dante's raising this

00:50:47.561 --> 00:50:51.472
contradiction that's
not--imagination is made to be

00:50:51.472 --> 00:50:53.429
the way to knowledge.
 

00:50:53.429 --> 00:50:56.639
I can only know through the
imagination.

00:50:56.639 --> 00:51:00.507
The imagination of--that
depends on my perception of the

00:51:00.507 --> 00:51:04.516
world or an imagination which
frees me completely from the

00:51:04.516 --> 00:51:07.684
world,
and then these two ideas of the

00:51:07.684 --> 00:51:11.623
imagination are really in
contradiction one with the

00:51:11.623 --> 00:51:12.320
other.
 

00:51:12.320 --> 00:51:14.840
So where is the human
responsibility?

00:51:14.840 --> 00:51:21.139
The poem gets nourished by this
duality of the imagination.

00:51:21.139 --> 00:51:25.059
The poem moves back and forth
between one and the other.

00:51:25.059 --> 00:51:28.387
And let me just stop here
because I think I may have said

00:51:28.387 --> 00:51:31.893
a little bit too much about
these issues and I could respond

00:51:31.893 --> 00:51:35.510
to your questions,
I hope, if there are some.

00:51:45.769 --> 00:51:47.989
Please.
 

00:51:47.989 --> 00:51:50.425
Student:
So just as sins of the Inferno

00:51:50.425 --> 00:51:53.726
were more products of the will,
the sins in Purgatory are more

00:51:53.726 --> 00:51:56.920
products of love and he's not
told where will may or may not

00:51:56.920 --> 00:51:59.896
have been factored into it,
and because Purgatory is the

00:51:59.896 --> 00:52:02.710
place that's in between,
is it also the place of that

00:52:02.710 --> 00:52:04.496
uncertainty between will and
love?

00:52:04.496 --> 00:52:07.420
Prof: Well I don't know
about that.

00:52:07.420 --> 00:52:13.414
The question is really a
perplexity about what I have

00:52:13.414 --> 00:52:15.030
been saying.
 

00:52:15.030 --> 00:52:21.159
In Inferno, will is crucial and
you are absolutely right.

00:52:21.159 --> 00:52:26.809
There cannot be a sin unless
there is a will involved.

00:52:26.809 --> 00:52:29.659
In Purgatorio,
the argument here seems to be--

00:52:29.659 --> 00:52:32.525
the way I have been following
it from Cantos XV,

00:52:32.525 --> 00:52:35.940
XVI, XVII and the way it's
going to be developed in XVIII

00:52:35.940 --> 00:52:39.690
and actually frankly XIX,
where Dante goes on telling a

00:52:39.690 --> 00:52:43.867
dream--
Dante makes the word of love

00:52:43.867 --> 00:52:49.469
the crucial act of our being in
the word,

00:52:49.469 --> 00:52:53.159
relating us to God,
we are related to God,

00:52:53.159 --> 00:52:55.429
really born through the way of
love,

00:52:55.429 --> 00:52:59.067
therefore, the way of the heart
and not unnecessarily through

00:52:59.067 --> 00:53:01.250
some abstract metaphysical
issues.

00:53:01.250 --> 00:53:06.760
Then the issue becomes how is
this love related to the will?

00:53:06.760 --> 00:53:09.219
Is Dante being uncertain
between the two?

00:53:09.219 --> 00:53:13.952
What is the moral--Dante begins
in Canto XV talking about moral

00:53:13.952 --> 00:53:17.204
responsibilities,
this kind of free subjection

00:53:17.204 --> 00:53:20.166
that we have,
and an inner light that is

00:53:20.166 --> 00:53:21.500
available to us.
 

00:53:21.500 --> 00:53:26.679
Then he--Canto XVI we'll also
talk about the--

00:53:26.679 --> 00:53:29.539
in Canto XVI he talks about
creation,

00:53:29.539 --> 00:53:33.097
the creation of the soul,
the freedom with which God

00:53:33.097 --> 00:53:35.960
creates and that freedom
authorizes us.

00:53:35.960 --> 00:53:41.030
It becomes a sort of ground for
the human freedom.

00:53:41.030 --> 00:53:43.119
Then in XVII,
first of all,

00:53:43.119 --> 00:53:47.943
he talks about an imagination
which is completely free of any

00:53:47.943 --> 00:53:53.489
contact with the world and then
talks about this theory of love,

00:53:53.489 --> 00:53:57.173
that rational love that
organizes, the love of knowledge

00:53:57.173 --> 00:53:59.050
that organizes everything.
 

00:53:59.050 --> 00:54:01.960
I could just have stopped there
and shown you,

00:54:01.960 --> 00:54:06.192
this is really what the text
says, and maybe ask you to

00:54:06.192 --> 00:54:10.815
connect imagination and love
that I read at the two sides of

00:54:10.815 --> 00:54:14.731
Canto XVII,
at the very center of the poem,

00:54:14.731 --> 00:54:19.369
almost to imply that we can
love only and so far as--

00:54:19.369 --> 00:54:23.219
and we can love as well as our
imagination takes us to loving.

00:54:23.219 --> 00:54:26.500
That's clearly one of the
images.

00:54:26.500 --> 00:54:29.590
But clearly there is more in
that debate.

00:54:29.590 --> 00:54:33.677
The debate is that if I love
according well,

00:54:33.677 --> 00:54:36.150
or not enough,
or too much,

00:54:36.150 --> 00:54:41.190
that has to do with the way I
perceive the world.

00:54:41.190 --> 00:54:46.224
Why does he have to talk about
an imagination which is so

00:54:46.224 --> 00:54:50.268
unbounded that it needs nothing
of reality?

00:54:50.268 --> 00:54:53.226
I mean to say this that in the
subject and I call it--I say

00:54:53.226 --> 00:54:55.929
well this is a visionary aspect
of the imagination.

00:54:55.929 --> 00:54:59.610
It's a poet who thinks of
himself as being the visionary

00:54:59.610 --> 00:55:00.079
poet.
 

00:55:00.079 --> 00:55:03.489
You have an idea of Romantic
poets,

00:55:03.489 --> 00:55:06.514
for instance,
English Romantic poets who

00:55:06.514 --> 00:55:10.469
distinguish between fantasy and
the imagination,

00:55:10.469 --> 00:55:14.521
though Dante does it in terms
of this imaginative power that

00:55:14.521 --> 00:55:17.199
removes me from the world of
reality.

00:55:17.199 --> 00:55:21.684
It takes me away and opens up
new spaces and the mind in

00:55:21.684 --> 00:55:22.420
itself.
 

00:55:22.420 --> 00:55:25.567
I ask this question though from
another point of view,

00:55:25.567 --> 00:55:29.250
which I think is connected to
what we have been saying here.

00:55:29.250 --> 00:55:33.416
Can Dante ever write this kind
of poem by being bound to the

00:55:33.416 --> 00:55:37.443
world of reality and to the way
in which the real world is

00:55:37.443 --> 00:55:38.150
known?
 

00:55:38.150 --> 00:55:39.840
Clearly the answer is no.
 

00:55:39.840 --> 00:55:44.686
The only way that Dante can
come to God and the vision of

00:55:44.686 --> 00:55:47.889
God is by agreeing with this
idea,

00:55:47.889 --> 00:55:51.351
yielding, surrendering to the
power of the imagination that

00:55:51.351 --> 00:55:53.619
will take him out of the real
world.

00:55:53.619 --> 00:55:57.635
You cannot really write a poem
like the Divine Comedy by

00:55:57.635 --> 00:56:02.204
following rules and laws,
whether they are rhetorical,

00:56:02.204 --> 00:56:06.730
or whether they are just pure
ideas of style.

00:56:06.730 --> 00:56:11.423
You try to--you have to go on
imagining things that don't

00:56:11.423 --> 00:56:15.030
really--are available to our
perceptions.

00:56:15.030 --> 00:56:16.639
That, to me,
is the issue,

00:56:16.639 --> 00:56:19.409
that's how I have been moving
this issue.

00:56:19.409 --> 00:56:23.025
I think that the poem,
that Dante's voice is suspended

00:56:23.025 --> 00:56:26.639
between these two possibilities
of the imagination.

00:56:26.639 --> 00:56:29.619
An imagination that has to
accept the world of reality,

00:56:29.619 --> 00:56:33.335
an ordinary imagination,
and yet there is also another

00:56:33.335 --> 00:56:37.768
idea of the imagination,
which is so much more powerful.

00:56:37.768 --> 00:56:40.661
But, if we accept this as being
true for the poem,

00:56:40.661 --> 00:56:43.965
it follows we have to ask the
question of, what about the

00:56:43.965 --> 00:56:44.849
moral life?
 

00:56:44.849 --> 00:56:49.250
Is the moral life then one that
where Dante's saying,

00:56:49.250 --> 00:56:53.943
that in effect,
all the language of blame and

00:56:53.943 --> 00:56:58.438
praise,
which depends on accepting

00:56:58.438 --> 00:57:03.449
limits and free subjection to
rules,

00:57:03.449 --> 00:57:06.280
is that--is he saying that that
is also--

00:57:06.280 --> 00:57:08.420
maybe it's arbitrary?
 

00:57:08.420 --> 00:57:11.329
That there may be some other
law that he has to discover?

00:57:11.329 --> 00:57:14.503
I don't think that there is yet
an answer here,

00:57:14.503 --> 00:57:18.159
but that's the problem that I
was trying to convey.

00:57:18.159 --> 00:57:22.326
Does that answer
your--provisionally--your

00:57:22.326 --> 00:57:24.460
perplexities,
okay.

00:57:28.409 --> 00:57:29.159
Yes.
 

00:57:29.159 --> 00:57:32.682
Student:
Regarding Canto XVI with the

00:57:32.682 --> 00:57:37.353
vision of anger served--the
beginning of anger that served

00:57:37.353 --> 00:57:42.432
as a polar opposite condition to
love, why does he think anger?

00:57:42.432 --> 00:57:47.184
Prof: The question is
does the sin of anger in Canto

00:57:47.184 --> 00:57:51.610
XVI, is that a kind of polar
opposite to love?

00:57:51.610 --> 00:57:52.831
Student:
And why does he begin with it?

00:57:52.831 --> 00:57:54.000
Prof: Why does it begin
with that?

00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:57.710
Well I think that anger--I
would define it as a form of

00:57:57.710 --> 00:57:59.360
madness to begin with.
 

00:57:59.360 --> 00:58:05.498
It's a kind of eclipse of all
rationality and so it explains

00:58:05.498 --> 00:58:11.949
why Dante will have to go on
retrieving the laws of reason,

00:58:11.949 --> 00:58:15.199
the laws of rationality to be
opposed to the kind of--

00:58:15.199 --> 00:58:20.800
to that--the experience of
madness in Canto XVI.

00:58:20.800 --> 00:58:25.840
We go into Canto XVII and he's
talking about a sort of love

00:58:25.840 --> 00:58:30.913
which is very rational,
but then he is undoing it with

00:58:30.913 --> 00:58:35.510
something that stands between
madness and love,

00:58:35.510 --> 00:58:36.480
and that's the imagination.
 

00:58:36.480 --> 00:58:39.900
See the connection?
 

00:58:39.900 --> 00:58:41.150
Okay.
 

00:58:41.280 --> 00:58:43.568
Student:
I'm a little confused about

00:58:43.568 --> 00:58:47.056
what you just said about how the
moral life might present a power

00:58:47.056 --> 00:58:50.327
to the imagination--I just think
if--what if an understanding

00:58:50.327 --> 00:58:52.998
from what you've been saying
about why you use the

00:58:52.998 --> 00:58:56.322
imagination is because you're
approaching mystery so it's hard

00:58:56.322 --> 00:58:58.393
to use the real world to
approach this.

00:58:58.393 --> 00:59:01.664
So it seems like--and so you
need the imagination and I guess

00:59:01.664 --> 00:59:04.226
if Dante is going to God,
so if he's approaching

00:59:04.226 --> 00:59:07.659
mysteries, so it's hard for him
to talk about this in a rational

00:59:07.659 --> 00:59:08.150
language.
 

00:59:08.150 --> 00:59:10.983
But isn't that more of like an
acknowledgement of his

00:59:10.983 --> 00:59:12.728
limitations than a
transgression,

00:59:12.728 --> 00:59:15.943
so doesn't it still fit with
humility and fit with the moral

00:59:15.943 --> 00:59:16.217
life?
 

00:59:16.217 --> 00:59:19.760
Prof: That's an
excellent point.

00:59:19.760 --> 00:59:24.442
You not only asked the question
I think that you are clarifying

00:59:24.442 --> 00:59:26.179
some of the problems.
 

00:59:26.179 --> 00:59:30.724
The question is still about the
whole issue of the imagination

00:59:30.724 --> 00:59:34.822
that on the one hand the
imagination seems to be the way

00:59:34.822 --> 00:59:38.980
to so large and so--
such a force that will take

00:59:38.980 --> 00:59:42.230
Dante, I'm paraphrasing your
point,

00:59:42.230 --> 00:59:45.300
take Dante all the way to see
God.

00:59:45.300 --> 00:59:49.860
I seem to be saying that that
is a kind of transgression,

00:59:49.860 --> 00:59:54.827
but you emphasize that that can
be an acknowledgement of human

00:59:54.827 --> 00:59:56.130
limitations.
 

00:59:56.130 --> 01:00:02.849
I call it--maybe that's true,
that's really what it is.

01:00:02.849 --> 01:00:08.070
It's--I call that a visionary
power within him.

01:00:08.070 --> 01:00:11.809
It may be coming to him from
the outside.

01:00:11.809 --> 01:00:15.670
He asks that question,
does this visionary power come

01:00:15.670 --> 01:00:19.307
to me from the outside,
or is it something that is

01:00:19.307 --> 01:00:21.090
within human beings?
 

01:00:21.090 --> 01:00:23.768
That's the question.
 

01:00:23.768 --> 01:00:26.789
He doesn't answer that question
at that point.

01:00:26.789 --> 01:00:31.108
What he does say is,
well this is the image that

01:00:31.108 --> 01:00:36.161
came to me, the image of a
martyr who committed suicide,

01:00:36.161 --> 01:00:39.929
and he goes on with his three
images.

01:00:39.929 --> 01:00:45.271
He doesn't answer that directly
and I think that he wants to

01:00:45.271 --> 01:00:50.250
keep you guessing if this is a
human transgression or an

01:00:50.250 --> 01:00:53.510
acknowledgement of human limits.
 

01:00:53.510 --> 01:00:58.052
He--I don't think that he knows
yet, at this point,

01:00:58.052 --> 01:01:02.139
what the unfolding of that
dilemma will be.

01:01:02.139 --> 01:01:06.594
He wants us to think in terms
of that dilemma and that dilemma

01:01:06.594 --> 01:01:08.860
is at the heart of Purgatory.
 

01:01:08.860 --> 01:01:13.469
The dilemma between what is
this power?

01:01:13.469 --> 01:01:17.257
I have a power within me
that--without which I can never

01:01:17.257 --> 01:01:20.079
really go to God,
and is this in any way a

01:01:20.079 --> 01:01:21.320
transgression?
 

01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:25.518
Do I need a transgression in
order to come to God?

01:01:25.518 --> 01:01:29.733
Ulysses thought that there
would be no knowledge without

01:01:29.733 --> 01:01:30.960
transgression.
 

01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:34.599
Maybe Adam in the Garden also
thought that there would be no

01:01:34.599 --> 01:01:37.376
knowledge without
transgression--that the real

01:01:37.376 --> 01:01:39.289
knowledge is to transgress.
 

01:01:39.289 --> 01:01:42.000
Is Dante thinking that way?
 

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:46.144
Or maybe he's thinking that
there is no transgression

01:01:46.144 --> 01:01:50.610
without, at the same time,
a sense of the limitations.

01:01:50.610 --> 01:01:53.181
That indeed,
that the idea of transgression

01:01:53.181 --> 01:01:55.570
depends on some sense of
limitations.

01:01:55.570 --> 01:01:56.969
Do you see what I'm saying?
 

01:01:56.969 --> 01:02:00.851
What the argument seems to me
could very well be,

01:02:00.851 --> 01:02:04.733
that in effect pride and
humility are really more

01:02:04.733 --> 01:02:08.050
connected than what we like to
think.

01:02:08.050 --> 01:02:14.070
We are always proud and Dante
would say, it's good.

01:02:14.070 --> 01:02:17.920
To me that's what Canto X,
XI, and XII were saying.

01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:20.952
You may not agree with that
reading, that pride is good in

01:02:20.952 --> 01:02:24.519
the measure in which I can reach
out for something really higher.

01:02:24.519 --> 01:02:26.018
That's not bad.
 

01:02:26.018 --> 01:02:30.219
What is bad is that that blinds
me to something else.

01:02:30.219 --> 01:02:34.400
I take that to be Franciscan
thinking.

01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:39.398
He is invoking the humblest
voice of the whole literary

01:02:39.398 --> 01:02:43.842
tradition up to this time,
the Canticle of all

01:02:43.842 --> 01:02:45.510
Creatures.
 

01:02:45.510 --> 01:02:50.166
I'm glad that you are giving me
the opportunity to refocus on

01:02:50.166 --> 01:02:54.202
the fact that that dilemma
between pride and humility

01:02:54.202 --> 01:02:58.548
reappears as a question of
limits and transgressions with

01:02:58.548 --> 01:03:02.429
the imagination and knowledge
and with love.

01:03:02.429 --> 01:03:07.744
Of course, Dante would say that
there is such a thing of love

01:03:07.744 --> 01:03:11.152
within--
with laws and yet love is one

01:03:11.152 --> 01:03:16.197
of those experiences where we
usually don't like to believe

01:03:16.197 --> 01:03:19.590
that there are limits,
right?

01:03:19.590 --> 01:03:25.139
You don't want anybody to
come--I hope--to come to your

01:03:25.139 --> 01:03:29.663
door and say,
I love you in a very reasonable

01:03:29.663 --> 01:03:33.570
way and with a lot of
limitations.

01:03:33.570 --> 01:03:40.119
I'm sure you'll give--kick him
out.

01:03:40.119 --> 01:03:44.478
Love is one of those
experiences exactly like the

01:03:44.478 --> 01:03:47.824
imagination,
that the powers of which seem

01:03:47.824 --> 01:03:51.519
always to be transgressing
whatever limitations we want

01:03:51.519 --> 01:03:53.817
to--
we wanted to transgress the

01:03:53.817 --> 01:03:57.000
limitations,
rationally, reasonably we want

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:58.268
to impose on it.
 

01:03:58.268 --> 01:04:00.429
This is the question that Dante
is raising.

01:04:00.429 --> 01:04:05.010
You cannot have,
I think that you are--

01:04:05.010 --> 01:04:07.150
you are onto the right track
with your--

01:04:07.150 --> 01:04:10.443
in your paraphrasing the
whole--in your asking the

01:04:10.443 --> 01:04:13.670
question that maybe
transgression and limitations

01:04:13.670 --> 01:04:16.090
really have to be seen together.
 

01:04:16.090 --> 01:04:18.349
Pride and humility will have to
be seen together;

01:04:18.349 --> 01:04:21.219
subjection and freedom will
have to be seen together.

01:04:21.219 --> 01:04:26.619
They are not terms which are so
far apart from each other.

01:04:26.619 --> 01:04:31.592
Each involves the other,
that's why I call it a paradox,

01:04:31.592 --> 01:04:35.300
the knot that joins these
things together,

01:04:35.300 --> 01:04:37.110
is exactly that.
 

01:04:37.110 --> 01:04:41.130
Is this--am I--did I confuse
all of you today here?

01:04:41.130 --> 01:04:44.349
Oh my, then I will confuse you
next time.

01:04:44.349 --> 01:04:46.590
Other questions that we have?
 

01:04:48.949 --> 01:04:49.599
Yes.
 

01:04:49.599 --> 01:04:53.489
Student:
Can you talk about the section

01:04:53.489 --> 01:04:58.851
in Canto XV where he's talking
about how true love and the love

01:04:58.851 --> 01:05:00.925
of God is like a mirror?
 

01:05:00.925 --> 01:05:02.829
It's around line 70...
 

01:05:02.829 --> 01:05:05.250
Prof: Canto XV.
 

01:05:05.250 --> 01:05:07.300
Student:
Line 75...

01:05:07.300 --> 01:05:08.860
Prof: Yes.
 

01:05:08.860 --> 01:05:11.652
Student:
How love of God is like his

01:05:11.652 --> 01:05:14.443
mirror that--the more people
that love God,

01:05:14.443 --> 01:05:18.432
the more love he gives back and
it's like a mirror that keeps

01:05:18.432 --> 01:05:20.492
reflecting and amplifying love.
 

01:05:20.492 --> 01:05:24.150
And I was wondering--I was
intrigued by the image of the

01:05:24.150 --> 01:05:28.204
mirror, so I was hoping that you
could talk a little bit about

01:05:28.204 --> 01:05:32.260
how the image of the mirrors and
the idea of mirrors maybe are

01:05:32.260 --> 01:05:34.387
part of Dante's way of thinking.
 

01:05:34.387 --> 01:05:37.047
Prof: The--this is
around line 75,

01:05:37.047 --> 01:05:38.510
right?
 

01:05:38.510 --> 01:05:41.719
Let me just read this whole
paragraph.

01:05:41.719 --> 01:05:48.635
Dante is in the--describing the
virtue that is opposed to envy,

01:05:48.635 --> 01:05:55.105
mercy, the idea of--the notion
of mercy and because--I read

01:05:55.105 --> 01:05:59.539
from 65 on:
"Because thou still

01:05:59.539 --> 01:06:05.945
settest thy mind on earthly
things, thou gatherest darkness

01:06:05.945 --> 01:06:09.150
from the very light."
 

01:06:09.150 --> 01:06:15.208
That's part of--sort of
reversals that we--how light

01:06:15.208 --> 01:06:20.579
induces and generates darkness;
it's a certain kind of light.

01:06:20.579 --> 01:06:25.056
We seem to believe or to think
in terms of the light that is

01:06:25.056 --> 01:06:28.472
available to us,
but that does not necessarily

01:06:28.472 --> 01:06:32.719
produce more light,
but can dim our understanding

01:06:32.719 --> 01:06:35.929
about the way things really are.
 

01:06:35.929 --> 01:06:40.159
"That infinite and
unspeakable good which is there

01:06:40.159 --> 01:06:44.780
above speeds to love as a
sunbeam comes to a bright body;

01:06:44.780 --> 01:06:48.030
so much it gives of itself as
it finds ardor,

01:06:48.030 --> 01:06:52.396
so the more charity extends the
more does the eternal goodness

01:06:52.396 --> 01:06:55.702
increase upon it,
and the more souls that are

01:06:55.702 --> 01:06:59.722
enamored there above the more
there are to be rightly loved

01:06:59.722 --> 01:07:04.021
and the more love there is and
like a mirror the one returns it

01:07:04.021 --> 01:07:05.268
to the other.
 

01:07:05.268 --> 01:07:09.414
And if my speech do not relieve
thy hunger thou shalt see

01:07:09.414 --> 01:07:13.856
Beatrice and she will deliver
thee wholly from this and every

01:07:13.856 --> 01:07:15.190
other craving.
 

01:07:15.190 --> 01:07:19.797
Strive only that soon may be
erased, as the other two are

01:07:19.797 --> 01:07:23.829
already, the five wounds which
are healed by being

01:07:23.829 --> 01:07:25.309
painful."
 

01:07:25.309 --> 01:07:29.112
The question is,
you want me to say something

01:07:29.112 --> 01:07:33.260
about the mirror,
the image of the mirror that is

01:07:33.260 --> 01:07:34.989
being used here.
 

01:07:34.989 --> 01:07:42.945
I think that this is a Platonic
image of the notion that all of

01:07:42.945 --> 01:07:49.875
creation--this is The
Celestial Hierarchy of the

01:07:49.875 --> 01:07:52.570
Pseudo-Dionysius.
 

01:07:52.570 --> 01:07:55.099
I don't know that I have ever
spoken of him,

01:07:55.099 --> 01:07:58.300
I will because Dante mentions
him in Paradise,

01:07:58.300 --> 01:08:00.070
but in The Celestial
Hierarchy,

01:08:00.070 --> 01:08:03.896
Dante--the
Pseudo-Dionysius--thinks of all

01:08:03.896 --> 01:08:07.349
creation being a kind of
occasion--

01:08:07.349 --> 01:08:14.603
being a kind of hall of mirrors
where everything is reflected

01:08:14.603 --> 01:08:20.786
onto the other,
a number of reflections that

01:08:20.786 --> 01:08:26.323
all give different light--
in different ways the light of

01:08:26.323 --> 01:08:29.322
God,
this is so--that's where the

01:08:29.322 --> 01:08:33.529
problem of mercy places us,
so this idea of charity.

01:08:33.529 --> 01:08:38.064
Dante is interested in two
things, one the generative idea

01:08:38.064 --> 01:08:39.100
of charity.
 

01:08:39.100 --> 01:08:42.368
Charity produces more charity.
 

01:08:42.368 --> 01:08:47.720
It has a kind of power to
generate itself and multiply

01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:51.180
itself,
and the way he compares this

01:08:51.180 --> 01:08:54.328
is--he compares it to what I
call--

01:08:54.328 --> 01:08:57.180
what he calls here,
obliquely, the hall of mirrors.

01:08:57.180 --> 01:09:02.220
Let me just say something else
about Pseudo-Dionysius,

01:09:02.220 --> 01:09:06.988
when Pseudo-Dionysius wants
to--mystical theology--

01:09:06.988 --> 01:09:11.938
he wants to talk about the
divine, he will think about the

01:09:11.938 --> 01:09:15.328
divine in terms of light,
as you know.

01:09:15.328 --> 01:09:20.640
Light that is refracted and
reflected throughout the orders

01:09:20.640 --> 01:09:22.840
and ranks of creation.
 

01:09:22.840 --> 01:09:29.720
The highest image of this light
of the divine is the sun.

01:09:29.720 --> 01:09:33.788
The sun that is generous,
in the sense,

01:09:33.788 --> 01:09:35.640
as I mean generous in a very
peculiar sense,

01:09:35.640 --> 01:09:39.310
in the sense that it gives
itself to all,

01:09:39.310 --> 01:09:43.760
without any distinction and it
depends on us,

01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:47.569
whether we are going to be able
to appreciate that light or not,

01:09:47.569 --> 01:09:51.760
but the sun is giving itself
freely to all.

01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:54.600
This is the principle of mercy
for Dante.

01:09:54.600 --> 01:09:58.868
Mirrors are reproducing that
light endlessly;

01:09:58.868 --> 01:10:02.851
the whole of creation is
sending back this kind of light,

01:10:02.851 --> 01:10:06.479
without any loss in itself of
the original light.

01:10:06.479 --> 01:10:11.158
This is the metaphor and the
metaphysics of mirror in Dante.

01:10:11.158 --> 01:10:14.487
The world is therefore,
from the point of view of

01:10:14.487 --> 01:10:17.605
mercy, and not from the point of
view of envy,

01:10:17.605 --> 01:10:20.310
where we do not even see the
light.

01:10:20.310 --> 01:10:24.592
Envy means that we have no
knowledge of anything that comes

01:10:24.592 --> 01:10:29.288
from the outside,
but in the world of mercy we

01:10:29.288 --> 01:10:32.863
have an--
we understand this generous

01:10:32.863 --> 01:10:38.431
giving of the light which comes
from God and the heat that goes

01:10:38.431 --> 01:10:39.420
with it.
 

01:10:39.420 --> 01:10:46.663
That's it, so it's a virtue
that completely offsets the

01:10:46.663 --> 01:10:51.201
notion of envy,
the idea of God who creates

01:10:51.201 --> 01:10:54.505
without envy,
that's another way of thinking

01:10:54.505 --> 01:10:56.560
about the generosity of God.
 

01:10:56.560 --> 01:11:00.528
That is connected to the light
and to the multiplications of

01:11:00.528 --> 01:11:02.210
the light from mirrors.
 

01:11:02.210 --> 01:11:07.988
Actually this is an image that
really reappears in

01:11:07.988 --> 01:11:14.238
Paradise and we'll come
back to this canto,

01:11:14.238 --> 01:11:19.850
the whole of Paradise organized
through this hall,

01:11:19.850 --> 01:11:32.529
these infinite reflections of
God's light.

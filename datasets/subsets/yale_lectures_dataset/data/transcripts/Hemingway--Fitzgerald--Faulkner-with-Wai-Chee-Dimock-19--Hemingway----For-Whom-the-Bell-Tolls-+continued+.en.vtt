00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.700
WAI CHEE DIMOCK: And this is
actually the historic end of the

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.367
Spanish Civil War.

00:00:15.367 --> 00:00:19.500
Obviously, the Republicans
lost. They were

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.933
on the losing side.

00:00:20.933 --> 00:00:27.733
And the winner gets to appear on
the cover of Time Magazine.

00:00:27.733 --> 00:00:33.767
March 27, 1939, General
Franco there.

00:00:33.767 --> 00:00:38.933
So even though it actually
ended slightly later than

00:00:38.933 --> 00:00:42.033
that, but already at that point
it was clear that there

00:00:42.033 --> 00:00:45.000
was no way the fascists
would not win.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.533
So that's why he was on the
cover of Time Magazine.

00:00:49.533 --> 00:00:53.433
So what we're looking at,
obviously, is some time before

00:00:53.433 --> 00:00:59.033
that, when things are still
basically up in the air.

00:00:59.033 --> 00:01:01.967
And so, when you get to the
end of For Whom the Bell

00:01:01.967 --> 00:01:06.967
Tolls, actually there's still
hope for Robert in many ways.

00:01:06.967 --> 00:01:08.967
And so we'll be looking
at that at the

00:01:08.967 --> 00:01:10.133
end of today's lecture.

00:01:10.133 --> 00:01:12.333
But I also want to call your
attention to a very

00:01:12.333 --> 00:01:17.633
interesting fact about the
Spanish Civil War, which is

00:01:17.633 --> 00:01:23.133
that it was very much a women's
war, unlike World War

00:01:23.133 --> 00:01:27.700
I or, indeed, World War II,
where there weren't a lot of

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.167
women doing the actual
fighting.

00:01:31.167 --> 00:01:34.300
The Spanish Civil War was one
that was very proud of the

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:39.333
fact that women were
participating in a fairly

00:01:39.333 --> 00:01:40.567
significant way.

00:01:40.567 --> 00:01:46.667
So we can see that both in the
posters celebrating that fact,

00:01:46.667 --> 00:01:58.300
but also in numerous photos that
we have of women either

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.867
training or actually in
combat situations.

00:02:01.867 --> 00:02:03.533
There's one of them.

00:02:03.533 --> 00:02:09.000
They were trained just as a man
would be trained, and they

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
were in uniform.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.867
And this was a woman militia
from Barcelona, I think.

00:02:15.867 --> 00:02:20.167
And, once more, women
fighting.

00:02:20.167 --> 00:02:22.900
So partly I think that accounts
for the fact that

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.000
Pilar is such a powerful figure
in For Whom the Bell

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.333
Tolls, that this is one of the
few Hemingway novels where

00:02:30.333 --> 00:02:34.800
there's a fairly strong
woman's voice.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.867
We might think that maybe she's
too good to be true,

00:02:37.867 --> 00:02:40.867
that maybe it's overly
idealized, but, in any case,

00:02:40.867 --> 00:02:46.133
Pilar is a rare instance of a
very powerful woman who would

00:02:46.133 --> 00:02:51.933
dare to cast her judgment,
pass her judgment, on the

00:02:51.933 --> 00:02:53.767
conduct of her own side.

00:02:53.767 --> 00:02:57.600
And she thought that the
revolution had begun badly, as

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.100
we saw last time.

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.967
A woman who's not afraid
to have that opinion.

00:03:02.967 --> 00:03:05.567
So partly it had to do with the
fact that the women were

00:03:05.567 --> 00:03:11.900
so important in the Spanish
Civil War as soldiers, but I

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.400
think that it also has something
to do with the

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.767
personal circumstances in
Hemingway's own life.

00:03:18.767 --> 00:03:21.567
If you turn to the front of
For Whom the Bell Tolls,

00:03:21.567 --> 00:03:24.067
you'll see that it's dedicated
to Martha Gelhorn.

00:03:26.933 --> 00:03:30.833
Hemingway was married to Martha
Gelhorn when they were

00:03:30.833 --> 00:03:32.267
writing, when they
were covering the

00:03:32.267 --> 00:03:33.733
Spanish Civil War.

00:03:33.733 --> 00:03:36.600
And she very much was
a very important

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.967
journalist in her own right.

00:03:38.967 --> 00:03:43.400
So this is the book that she
wrote, both about the Spanish

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:48.367
Civil War, but also about World
War II, and in fact

00:03:48.367 --> 00:03:51.967
about Vietnam.

00:03:51.967 --> 00:03:54.700
It went all the way
to the '60s.

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.800
So she really had a very long,
distinguished career as a war

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:03.200
journalist. And in recognition
of the fact, there actually

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.633
was a United States postage
stamp celebrating her writing,

00:04:07.633 --> 00:04:12.600
with her wartime writings
from Japan and China.

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.367
The Chinese Revolution was a
very important part of her

00:04:14.367 --> 00:04:18.100
writing, and in Normandy
and Dachau, the

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.467
World War II episodes.

00:04:20.467 --> 00:04:24.200
So I was tempted, actually, to
read some of her writing, but

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:28.567
there's just no room to
incorporate her wartime

00:04:28.567 --> 00:04:30.600
reporting into this class.

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.967
But I just want to draw your
attention to the fact that she

00:04:32.967 --> 00:04:36.400
was actually a very significant
companion to

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.000
Hemingway in more
ways than one.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:46.233
So today we'll be talking about
basically the narrative

00:04:46.233 --> 00:04:48.233
form of Hemingway.

00:04:48.233 --> 00:04:51.833
And you guys will be getting
paper topics very soon from

00:04:51.833 --> 00:04:55.967
your the teaching fellows, and
one of the topics will have to

00:04:55.967 --> 00:04:59.400
do with forms of narration,
the narrative structure.

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.900
So I want to start talking about
that, and to get you

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:08.133
guys thinking about various
experimental or well

00:05:08.133 --> 00:05:14.567
rehearsed, but nonetheless still
reinvigorated, forms in

00:05:14.567 --> 00:05:16.400
this novel.

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.833
So we'll be looking at questions
of symmetry, and a

00:05:20.833 --> 00:05:24.833
mirror effect that already we've
seen a little bit of.

00:05:24.833 --> 00:05:28.567
Last time we talked about
negative mirroring, the earth

00:05:28.567 --> 00:05:33.700
moving for Robert Jordan and
Maria when they made love, and

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:37.933
that being mirrored negatively
with the bombing when the

00:05:37.933 --> 00:05:42.100
earth moved under the feet of
the people who were bombed.

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:47.067
So that's one instance of
negative symmetry, something

00:05:47.067 --> 00:05:50.433
being ironized retroactively.

00:05:50.433 --> 00:05:52.600
Today we'll be looking
at more instances of

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:55.100
those kinds of symmetry.

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:57.600
So obviously, possession
and dispossession, have

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:58.300
and have not --

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:02.067
a longstanding paradigm that
we've been looking at --

00:06:02.067 --> 00:06:04.500
ironic and not ironic.

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:06.567
And then, also, ending and
beginning, very important in

00:06:06.567 --> 00:06:08.367
this novel.

00:06:08.367 --> 00:06:12.500
But I want to begin by looking
at one particular symmetry,

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:17.400
which is the symmetry of
brutality, or brutal conduct.

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:21.333
Execution that we saw, the
execution of the fascists that

00:06:21.333 --> 00:06:24.067
we saw last time
in Chapter 10.

00:06:24.067 --> 00:06:29.167
And then in Chapter 31,
a similar, maybe more

00:06:29.167 --> 00:06:35.167
horrendous, episode of fascist
violence, the rape that is

00:06:35.167 --> 00:06:38.067
inflicted on Maria.

00:06:38.067 --> 00:06:41.733
So it really goes back, also, to
the importance of women in

00:06:41.733 --> 00:06:44.067
the Spanish Civil War as well.

00:06:44.067 --> 00:06:49.467
And because rape is such an of
explosive subject, there's

00:06:49.467 --> 00:06:51.533
been lots done on rape.

00:06:51.533 --> 00:06:55.300
This is Susan Brownmiller's
Against Our Will, it's one of

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:58.733
the classic considerations
of rape.

00:06:58.733 --> 00:07:03.200
There also has been lots and
lots of representation of rape

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:10.867
in painting, especially rape
considered as a metaphor for

00:07:10.867 --> 00:07:16.900
the brutalities perpetrated on
the defeated by the victors.

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:21.200
So even though it's the women
who are getting raped, it

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:24.600
really is a metaphor for
what happens to the

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:27.433
losers in the war.

00:07:27.433 --> 00:07:31.967
So Poussin actually had
a number of paintings.

00:07:31.967 --> 00:07:35.067
I can't even keep count of
the significant number.

00:07:35.067 --> 00:07:39.933
This is one, and this is another
one at the Louvre, a

00:07:39.933 --> 00:07:42.367
very well known painting.

00:07:42.367 --> 00:07:44.667
It can get monotonous
after a while.

00:07:44.667 --> 00:07:47.267
They are different, but they're

00:07:47.267 --> 00:07:49.400
also quite a bit alike.

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:55.167
So when Picasso came to redoing
this theme, you can

00:07:55.167 --> 00:07:58.500
see that this is a real
new departure.

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:02.567
It looks nothing like the
Poussin paintings.

00:08:02.567 --> 00:08:09.000
And so that is the twentieth
century take on a very time

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.133
honored theme.

00:08:11.133 --> 00:08:16.167
And I would argue that Hemingway
is, in his own way,

00:08:16.167 --> 00:08:19.767
doing a novelistic rendition
of the rape of the Sabine

00:08:19.767 --> 00:08:25.800
women in the rape of just one
particular woman, Maria.

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:29.000
And I would argue that it is
every bit as innovative as the

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.500
Picasso painting, coming out at
the same time, a complete

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:36.000
departure from tradition.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
So what is innovative about
Hemingway, and it actually

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.933
goes back to his longstanding
interest in the mirror and

00:08:43.933 --> 00:08:45.600
looking at yourself
in the mirror.

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:49.933
The last time we saw that when
Robert was dropping the gun,

00:08:49.933 --> 00:08:53.600
the pistol that was misused by
his father, he was looking at

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:57.567
himself his mirror image in the
water, looking at himself

00:08:57.567 --> 00:08:58.900
holding the gun and
dropping the gun.

00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:03.267
So we've already seen one
instance of the mirror in For

00:09:03.267 --> 00:09:06.233
Whom the Bell Tolls, and this
is a much more traumatic

00:09:06.233 --> 00:09:08.467
instance of that.

00:09:08.467 --> 00:09:12.133
"I saw my face in the mirror
of the barbershop and the

00:09:12.133 --> 00:09:16.767
faces of three others who were
leaning over me and I knew

00:09:16.767 --> 00:09:22.000
none of the faces but in the
glass I saw myself and them,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.067
but they saw only me.

00:09:24.067 --> 00:09:27.567
And it was as though one were
in the dentist's chair and

00:09:27.567 --> 00:09:30.667
there were many dentists and
they were all insane.

00:09:30.667 --> 00:09:36.000
My own face I could hardly
recognize because my grief had

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.433
changed it but I looked at it
and knew that it was me.

00:09:40.433 --> 00:09:44.567
But my grief was so great that
I had no fear nor any feeling

00:09:44.567 --> 00:09:45.500
but my grief."

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:48.433
So this is not actually
the rape, it's just

00:09:48.433 --> 00:09:50.500
cutting off her hair.

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:55.267
In many ways an innocuous
exercise, but the rape would

00:09:55.267 --> 00:09:56.400
come after that.

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:58.800
And Maria doesn't talk about
the actual rape.

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:02.967
So this is all as close as we
can get, is the looking at

00:10:02.967 --> 00:10:05.200
herself in the mirror.

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:13.067
And I think it is a belated
rejoinder to the earlier

00:10:13.067 --> 00:10:18.267
episode of Robert looking at his
own face in the water, in

00:10:18.267 --> 00:10:23.267
a sense that this is associated
with trauma for

00:10:23.267 --> 00:10:24.933
some reason.

00:10:24.933 --> 00:10:30.200
To look at ones self in the
mirror is a traumatic tableau

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:30.967
for Hemingway.

00:10:30.967 --> 00:10:35.067
It's the precondition for
some kind of trauma.

00:10:35.067 --> 00:10:38.200
In the case of the earlier
episode with Robert looking at

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:42.700
himself mirrored in the water,
it's actually the beginning of

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:44.200
the cleansing process.

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:48.833
He's ridding himself of that
pistol that he would want to

00:10:48.833 --> 00:10:51.367
have nothing to do with.

00:10:51.367 --> 00:10:57.233
In this case, Maria looking at
herself in the mirror as the

00:10:57.233 --> 00:11:01.200
rape is about to happen is the
beginning of the trauma.

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:04.933
So let's look at the visual
tableau that Hemingway is

00:11:04.933 --> 00:11:06.167
creating for us.

00:11:06.167 --> 00:11:09.233
Because of the optics, the
particular optics of this

00:11:09.233 --> 00:11:14.767
scene, Maria can see herself
and then the three of them.

00:11:14.767 --> 00:11:16.933
And they can look in
the mirror and

00:11:16.933 --> 00:11:18.400
they see only Maria.

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:24.367
So this is a great example of
how self-consciousness is, in

00:11:24.367 --> 00:11:28.767
many ways, the burden of the
person who is tortured.

00:11:28.767 --> 00:11:32.133
The people who are doing the
torturing see only the object

00:11:32.133 --> 00:11:33.567
of the torture.

00:11:33.567 --> 00:11:36.133
So they get all the pleasure
from being able to inflict

00:11:36.133 --> 00:11:41.900
maximum damage on the person
that they are torturing.

00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:42.133
They don't see themselves
doing it.

00:11:42.133 --> 00:11:44.033
That's what enables them to do
it is that they don't see

00:11:44.033 --> 00:11:44.800
themselves.

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:49.833
Maria sees herself, and she sees
the three people who are

00:11:49.833 --> 00:11:53.300
able to do this to her.

00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:56.233
And what we're beginning to
see is, in many ways, the

00:11:56.233 --> 00:11:59.267
beginning of the process
of this procession.

00:11:59.267 --> 00:12:03.533
Maria looks at herself, but
because of those three looming

00:12:03.533 --> 00:12:06.867
figures behind her, already
she's not quite herself.

00:12:06.867 --> 00:12:10.433
She is herself plus those
three other people.

00:12:10.433 --> 00:12:14.267
And she's also not quite
herself because they're

00:12:14.267 --> 00:12:15.267
cutting off her hair.

00:12:15.267 --> 00:12:17.200
So she's losing a very

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:19.600
important part of her identity.

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:22.533
So she's beginning not
to recognize herself.

00:12:22.533 --> 00:12:26.433
And this process of not
recognizing herself would get

00:12:26.433 --> 00:12:31.233
dramatized in a way that goes
back, actually, to the image

00:12:31.233 --> 00:12:33.300
of the two lines that we had
talked about, and that Robert

00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:39.433
Motherwell also represented
in numerous paintings.

00:12:39.433 --> 00:12:46.067
The two orderly lines that would
be the utopian ideals of

00:12:46.067 --> 00:12:49.433
political ritual in the
execution of the fascists.

00:12:49.433 --> 00:12:54.767
In this case it is, once
again, a retroactive

00:12:54.767 --> 00:12:58.733
ironization of that earlier
utopian moment.

00:12:58.733 --> 00:13:03.400
We get the same two lines,
except that those two lines

00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:06.733
now have a completely
different meaning.

00:13:06.733 --> 00:13:12.000
"At that time I wore my hair in
two braids and I watched in

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.900
the mirror one of them lifted
one of the braids and pulled

00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:21.733
on it so it hurt me suddenly
through my grief and then cut

00:13:21.733 --> 00:13:25.100
it off close to my head
with a razor.

00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:29.800
And I saw myself with one braid
and a slash where the

00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:31.567
other had been.

00:13:31.567 --> 00:13:35.200
Then he cut off the other braid
but without pulling on

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:40.167
it and the razor made a small
cut on my ear and I saw blood

00:13:40.167 --> 00:13:41.200
come from it.

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:41.833
'Cans't thou feel the scar with

00:13:41.833 --> 00:13:45.500
thy finger?' 'Yes.

00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:46.900
But would it be better
not to talk of

00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:49.067
this?' 'This is nothing.

00:13:49.067 --> 00:13:52.200
I will not talk of that
which is bad.'

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:56.200
So he had cut both braids close
to my head with a razor

00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:58.700
and the others laughed and I did
not even feel the cut on

00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:02.533
my ear and then he stood in
front of me and struck me

00:14:02.533 --> 00:14:07.667
across the face with the braids
while the other two

00:14:07.667 --> 00:14:12.633
held me and he said, 'This
is how we make Red nuns.

00:14:12.633 --> 00:14:15.000
This will show thee
how to unite with

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.900
thy proletarian brothers.

00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:19.367
Bride of the Red Christ!

00:14:19.367 --> 00:14:22.200
And he struck me again and again
across the face with the

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:26.000
braids which had been mine and
then he put the two of them in

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.500
my mouth and tied them tight
around my neck, knotting them

00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:35.233
in the back to make a gag and
the two holding me laughed."

00:14:35.233 --> 00:14:41.100
So this is the new use to
which lines could be--

00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:46.967
the two braids belonging to
oneself can be used as weapons

00:14:46.967 --> 00:14:47.700
against oneself.

00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:52.000
So this is very much the same
logic as the earth rising up

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.433
and hitting the men that have
been rushing up to this point.

00:14:59.267 --> 00:15:04.433
So it's really the complete
reversal of the meaning of

00:15:04.433 --> 00:15:08.733
something that really is a
part of you, and radical

00:15:08.733 --> 00:15:15.967
alienation of that thing, and
the instrumentalization of

00:15:15.967 --> 00:15:19.067
that thing into a weapon.

00:15:19.067 --> 00:15:24.900
But even then, I think it's less
traumatic than the effect

00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:29.067
of looking at the mirror and
watching yourself losing first

00:15:29.067 --> 00:15:33.033
one braid and then the other,
and then watching the

00:15:33.033 --> 00:15:38.600
transformation of your face
when that is happening.

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:44.333
It is not only inflicting that
on Maria, but also making her

00:15:44.333 --> 00:15:48.367
watch herself undergo this
transformation, that she's

00:15:48.367 --> 00:15:53.167
becoming an alien being
even to her own eyes.

00:15:53.167 --> 00:15:58.000
So this is the conclusion of
that act of dispossession.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.733
"Then the one who had gagged me
ran a clipper all over my

00:16:01.733 --> 00:16:04.000
head; first from the forehead
all the way to the back of the

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.467
neck and then across the top and
then all over my head and

00:16:07.467 --> 00:16:10.933
close behind my ears and they
held me so I could see into

00:16:10.933 --> 00:16:13.700
the glass of the barber's mirror
all the time that they

00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:17.700
did this and I could not believe
it as I saw it done

00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:21.267
and I cried and cried but I
could not look away from the

00:16:21.267 --> 00:16:25.467
horror that my face made with
the mouth open and the braids

00:16:25.467 --> 00:16:31.100
tied it in and my head coming
naked under the clippers."

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:38.367
So this is the closest that
Hemingway will get to giving

00:16:38.367 --> 00:16:42.600
us an image of Maria being
rendered completely

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:47.200
defenseless, because all the
things that shelter ourselves

00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:49.967
are being taken away from her.

00:16:49.967 --> 00:16:57.067
Hair might not be the most
powerful form of shelter, but

00:16:57.067 --> 00:17:01.967
it is a form of shelter in the
sense that without it we

00:17:01.967 --> 00:17:06.533
really look very naked, naked
in a psychological sense.

00:17:06.533 --> 00:17:12.700
And Maria will become naked
in more than that sense.

00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:19.500
But it also has to do with
what kind of object Maria

00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:23.200
would be in the world.

00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:27.900
Before this happens, she would
never be an object to herself.

00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:31.500
She should always be a subject
to herself, in a sense that

00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:35.900
she would never actually see
herself as she's seeing

00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:37.100
herself right now.

00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:43.067
So it is really taking away
her relation to herself.

00:17:43.067 --> 00:17:44.933
That is being taken
away from her.

00:17:44.933 --> 00:17:49.633
It's not even just the hair,
which is nothing, which will

00:17:49.633 --> 00:17:52.100
grow back, although we can also
see that Hemingway is

00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:55.800
quite obsessed with hair and the
cutting off of hair, just

00:17:55.800 --> 00:18:00.900
as Fitzgerald is in "Bernice
Cuts Her Hair." But the

00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:05.867
physical removal of the hair
is really nothing compared

00:18:05.867 --> 00:18:11.433
with the destruction of a
longstanding relation that one

00:18:11.433 --> 00:18:12.700
has to oneself.

00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:20.700
And I think that we see a
similar operation when someone

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:24.733
would insult you to the point
where you don't actually

00:18:24.733 --> 00:18:27.333
recognize the person who
has been insulted.

00:18:27.333 --> 00:18:30.000
It might not ever have happened
to you, and very

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.900
rarely it happens to anyone, but
Zora Neale Hurston talks

00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:38.667
about that in an essay called,
"How I Became the Colored Me."

00:18:38.667 --> 00:18:41.800
It was then when she was
growing up in a black

00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:45.900
community in Florida, but she
never saw herself as black

00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:49.033
until she was made to feel
herself as black.

00:18:49.033 --> 00:18:53.333
So it's losing one kind of
identity to oneself.

00:18:53.333 --> 00:18:57.367
And what is happening here is
a similar kind of situation,

00:18:57.367 --> 00:19:01.033
that suddenly she sees herself
as something that she's never

00:19:01.033 --> 00:19:03.200
seen herself as before.

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:08.000
So it is both that operation,
but also the additional horror

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:13.167
that she cannot take her eyes
away from the mirror.

00:19:13.167 --> 00:19:16.500
She could easily have
shut her eyes.

00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:21.567
So the psychological atrocity
of this scene is that the

00:19:21.567 --> 00:19:28.000
dynamics of the scene is such
that she cannot take her eyes

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.233
away from this thing that she
cannot bear to watch.

00:19:31.233 --> 00:19:35.900
It is the gluing of her eyes
to something that she would

00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:39.900
want to do everything to
remove her eyes from.

00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:44.400
It is that gluing that is also
part of the atrocity.

00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:47.933
So it is the way that Hemingway
chooses to talk

00:19:47.933 --> 00:19:55.000
about rape, not the very,
completely recognizable

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:59.733
scenario that Poussin has made
classic in his classic

00:19:59.733 --> 00:20:01.467
compositions.

00:20:01.467 --> 00:20:06.333
And not even the Picasso
representation, which still

00:20:06.333 --> 00:20:11.400
has to do much more with someone
crying out in protest.

00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:15.700
We can almost hear the sound in
the Picasso representation.

00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:22.167
In the Maria episodes there is
absolutely no sound, because

00:20:22.167 --> 00:20:23.900
her mouth has been gagged.

00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:29.033
So it's the absolute silencing
of Maria, and the complete

00:20:29.033 --> 00:20:34.867
reduction of that scenario into
a visual scenario without

00:20:34.867 --> 00:20:39.400
sound in both the Poussin and
the Picasso painting.

00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:42.500
What makes it slightly bearable
is that we can

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:45.533
imagine those women
as crying out.

00:20:45.533 --> 00:20:49.100
And it is that crying out that
makes them human and registers

00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:51.500
the resistance to what is
being done to them.

00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:54.300
In the case of Maria, because
it is strictly a mirror

00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:58.333
effect, and because it is a
strictly visual tableau, and

00:20:58.333 --> 00:21:01.600
because her mouth is gagged,
it is completely soundless.

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:05.667
So it is the deprivation of
voice, along with the cutting

00:21:05.667 --> 00:21:10.467
of the hair, it's those two
things that work to create the

00:21:10.467 --> 00:21:12.600
maximum effect of

00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:15.500
victimization in the rape
scenes.

00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:21.067
So we can see that, for Maria,
dispossession is a central

00:21:21.067 --> 00:21:22.300
narrative fact.

00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:27.667
And it is registered with
full dramatic effect as

00:21:27.667 --> 00:21:32.167
unforgettable, an instance of
rape as any in American

00:21:32.167 --> 00:21:35.600
literature, but actually
representing the act itself.

00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:38.167
So that is part of the
innovation as well, is that

00:21:38.167 --> 00:21:42.233
you don't actually go anywhere
near the actual deed.

00:21:42.233 --> 00:21:45.133
Given the fact that
dispossession is so important

00:21:45.133 --> 00:21:47.900
for Maria, I think
that we have to

00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:50.567
ask a related question.

00:21:50.567 --> 00:21:52.400
To what extent is

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:55.933
dispossession central for
Robert?

00:21:55.933 --> 00:21:57.433
I think it is an
open question.

00:21:57.433 --> 00:22:00.300
I hope that you guys will talk
about it in section.

00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:04.367
It's whether or not Maria
actually gets to recover from

00:22:04.367 --> 00:22:06.133
that act of dispossession.

00:22:06.133 --> 00:22:12.400
Has she recovered fully from
that rape, or is she still

00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:14.833
living in the shadow
of that rape?

00:22:14.833 --> 00:22:19.067
How long does it take for
that shadow to go away?

00:22:19.067 --> 00:22:24.267
Is she still within the
narrative of dispossession all

00:22:24.267 --> 00:22:26.533
the way through For Whom
the Bell Tolls?

00:22:26.533 --> 00:22:29.167
So that's an open question
for Maria.

00:22:29.167 --> 00:22:33.500
For Robert it's a slightly
different question, and it has

00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:38.500
to do with two possible
trajectories for Robert.

00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:46.233
And so what I would like to
do here is to give you a

00:22:46.233 --> 00:22:51.800
demonstration of one way to
write your final paper, which

00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:59.400
is to write half of the paper as
dedicated to one argument,

00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:02.467
and the other half
as dedicated to

00:23:02.467 --> 00:23:04.100
the opposite argument.

00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:07.700
So this would be an interesting
experiment to do.

00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:09.000
Basically you're trying
to be a lawyer.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.933
Lawyers are supposed to argue
either side of a case.

00:23:11.933 --> 00:23:14.200
It's an intellectual exercise.

00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:17.100
Usually it takes, for most
of us, it takes a little

00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:17.767
bit more that that.

00:23:17.767 --> 00:23:20.700
We actually have to have some
kind of emotional investment

00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:25.333
in something to argue, to make
a very convincing case.

00:23:25.333 --> 00:23:30.367
But supposedly someone who's
trained as a lawyer should be

00:23:30.367 --> 00:23:31.867
able to argue either side.

00:23:31.867 --> 00:23:36.900
So what I'm offering you as one
possibility in the final

00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:43.233
paper is to make an argument
one way and then in exactly

00:23:43.233 --> 00:23:44.867
the opposite way.

00:23:44.867 --> 00:23:48.467
And in this case it's not even
a stretch for me to argue of

00:23:48.467 --> 00:23:50.800
both sides of the case,
because actually I'm

00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:53.033
completely torn in my mind.

00:23:53.033 --> 00:23:55.667
So actually, there is the
emotional investment on my

00:23:55.667 --> 00:23:58.733
part, in both sides
of the argument.

00:23:58.733 --> 00:24:07.100
So the two opposing arguments,
obviously one would be that

00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:12.900
For Whom the Bell Tolls is a
narrative about dispossession,

00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:20.400
that what Robert ends up with at
the end of the novel is as

00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:24.767
a "have not." That he starts out
with something, and by the

00:24:24.767 --> 00:24:27.733
end of the novel everything
is taken away from him.

00:24:27.733 --> 00:24:31.300
He is completely empty handed
at the end of the novel.

00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:35.533
A very harsh reading
of the novel.

00:24:35.533 --> 00:24:40.133
The other, and I like to end
with that, is to argue that it

00:24:40.133 --> 00:24:43.400
actually is a narrative
of repossession.

00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:47.633
Yes, that a lot has been taken
away from him, but that maybe

00:24:47.633 --> 00:24:52.233
we could still make a case that
he's not totally empty

00:24:52.233 --> 00:24:54.500
handed at the end
of the novel.

00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:58.833
And so I hope I'll be able to
make a compelling case for

00:24:58.833 --> 00:25:03.500
both, but let's start
with trajectory one.

00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:09.200
And, obviously, in order to make
a case for Robert as a

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:15.533
have not I think that we have
to put an ironic spin on the

00:25:15.533 --> 00:25:21.767
word "to have," especially a
memorable line, "Roberto, what

00:25:21.767 --> 00:25:26.200
hast thou?" And I want to bring
back, actually to a

00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:29.800
similar use, ironic
use, of the word

00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:32.100
"have" in As I Lay Dying.

00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:35.033
And following from that, we
can look at the narrative

00:25:35.033 --> 00:25:39.567
structure of For Whom the Bell
Tolls, and look at it as a

00:25:39.567 --> 00:25:43.000
narrative enactment in terms of
the formal structure of the

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.067
novel, as a narrative enactment
of the act of

00:25:45.067 --> 00:25:48.767
dispossession, that
Robert is losing

00:25:48.767 --> 00:25:50.200
control of the narrative.

00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:55.000
That an arm and a leg has been
cut off from him and taken

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:58.633
over by someone else, and
comparing that with maybe a

00:25:58.633 --> 00:26:02.967
similar situation in To
Have and Have Not.

00:26:02.967 --> 00:26:06.800
So first, to have as
an ironic word.

00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:11.233
This is at the very
end of the novel.

00:26:11.233 --> 00:26:14.467
"Maria was kneeling by him and
saying, 'Roberto, what hast

00:26:14.467 --> 00:26:20.633
thou?' He said, sweating
heavily, 'The left leg is

00:26:20.633 --> 00:26:24.733
broken, guapa.' The
sweat-streaked, bristly face

00:26:24.733 --> 00:26:28.633
bent down by him and Robert
Jordan smelt the

00:26:28.633 --> 00:26:31.333
full smell of Pablo.

00:26:31.333 --> 00:26:35.067
'Let us speak,' he said to Pilar
and Maria, 'I have to

00:26:35.067 --> 00:26:38.167
speak to Pablo.'

00:26:38.167 --> 00:26:41.100
'Does it hurt much?'
Pablo asked.

00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:43.067
He was bending close
over Robert Jordan.

00:26:43.067 --> 00:26:45.600
'No, I think the nerve
is crushed.

00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:45.800
Listen.

00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:46.600
Get along.

00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:48.133
I am mucked, see?

00:26:48.133 --> 00:26:50.267
I will talk to the girl for a
moment.' 'Clearly, there's not

00:26:50.267 --> 00:26:50.933
much time.'

00:26:50.933 --> 00:26:55.267
'Clearly.' 'I think you would
do better in the Republic,'

00:26:55.267 --> 00:26:55.800
Robert Jordan said.

00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:59.433
'Nay, I am for Grados.' 'Use
thy head.' 'Talk with her

00:26:59.433 --> 00:27:00.667
now,' Pablo said.

00:27:00.667 --> 00:27:02.500
'There is little time.

00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:08.500
I am sorry thou hast this,
Ingles.' 'Since I have it,'

00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:11.433
Robert Jordan said, 'let
us not speak of it.

00:27:11.433 --> 00:27:13.433
But use thy head.

00:27:13.433 --> 00:27:15.267
Thou hast much head.

00:27:15.267 --> 00:27:17.200
Use it.'"

00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:22.667
It is very hard to not to notice
the way that the key

00:27:22.667 --> 00:27:29.400
player in this passage is the
word to have. It begins with

00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:34.433
Maria asking Robert, innocently,
"What hast thou,"

00:27:34.433 --> 00:27:36.867
because, in fact, she doesn't
know whether the

00:27:36.867 --> 00:27:38.933
leg is really broken.

00:27:38.933 --> 00:27:40.533
But he knows.

00:27:43.467 --> 00:27:46.167
And it's at this point --

00:27:46.167 --> 00:27:52.967
it's the switching of Pablo
for Maria that, for me,

00:27:52.967 --> 00:27:58.067
represents one of the cruel
decisions on Hemingway's part.

00:27:58.067 --> 00:28:02.833
That, instead of having Maria
still bending over him, the

00:28:02.833 --> 00:28:06.233
person who's now bent over
Robert is Pablo, and what he

00:28:06.233 --> 00:28:09.767
smells is the full
smell of Pablo.

00:28:09.767 --> 00:28:14.100
It's a very, very significant
detail in the sense that

00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:17.900
Robert still doesn't
really know Pablo.

00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:22.333
He remains a mysterious figure
all the way through.

00:28:22.333 --> 00:28:24.967
I mentioned last time that
a lot of things happen.

00:28:24.967 --> 00:28:27.400
Pablo does a lot of things.

00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:31.400
He thinks lots of things when
we're not privy to what is

00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:33.600
going on in the narrative.

00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:36.300
And, likewise for Robert, he
simply doesn't know what's

00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:39.333
going on inside Pablo's head,
or what Pablo is doing.

00:28:39.333 --> 00:28:42.200
He's executing other people
when Robert isn't looking.

00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:45.333
So all this we suspect might
be happening, but we just

00:28:45.333 --> 00:28:46.767
never know.

00:28:46.767 --> 00:28:51.300
So Pablo is, from beginning to
end, he's always an opaque

00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:53.633
character both to Robert
and to us.

00:28:53.633 --> 00:28:56.967
But all that Robert can get
at this moment is the

00:28:56.967 --> 00:28:58.233
full smell of Pablo.

00:29:00.867 --> 00:29:04.933
It is that overwhelming odor,
almost like the smell of

00:29:04.933 --> 00:29:12.000
honeysuckle that is coming to
Robert at the end of his life.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:17.033
That is about the most that he
will ever get, it's not a

00:29:17.033 --> 00:29:21.467
cerebral understanding of Pablo,
it's just an animal

00:29:21.467 --> 00:29:26.100
apprehension of how powerful
a man this is, smells in an

00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:26.933
animal sense.

00:29:26.933 --> 00:29:30.800
And it's an animal's fear and
apprehension, but also a

00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:34.300
recognition of what kind
of a man Pablo is.

00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:38.933
So Pablo asks an innocent enough
question, "Does it hurt

00:29:38.933 --> 00:29:43.133
much?" But he knows
that there's no

00:29:43.133 --> 00:29:44.600
way Robert can travel.

00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:46.900
There's no way he can go with
the rest of the people.

00:29:49.533 --> 00:29:51.667
He knows perfectly well
how much time,

00:29:51.667 --> 00:29:53.033
really, is left to Robert.

00:29:59.267 --> 00:30:02.933
And there is an up front,
cruelly, I think, in the last

00:30:02.933 --> 00:30:08.433
thing that Pablo says to Robert,
"I'm sorry thou hast

00:30:08.433 --> 00:30:15.233
this, Ingles." From beginning
to end, the refusal of

00:30:15.233 --> 00:30:19.400
recognition that Robert is
American and English, that he

00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:22.600
has a name, even.

00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:28.067
For Pablo, Robert is just like
Kashkin someone with a rare

00:30:28.067 --> 00:30:31.200
name who comes in, who destroys
the bridge, destroys

00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:33.233
something, works the explosive,
is killed.

00:30:33.233 --> 00:30:35.067
He is another of those.

00:30:35.067 --> 00:30:38.100
A whole string of foreigners
coming though with totally

00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:40.633
forgettable names, and
not even getting

00:30:40.633 --> 00:30:42.100
the nationality right.

00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:46.900
So this is the ultimate insult
inflicted by Pablo on Robert

00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:48.533
at the very end of his life.

00:30:48.533 --> 00:30:51.900
And Robert is absolutely
defenseless.

00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:54.700
He's defenseless physically,
he's defenseless

00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:57.067
psychologically and
emotionally.

00:30:57.067 --> 00:31:02.767
All he can say is, in fact,
this admission of defeat

00:31:02.767 --> 00:31:06.600
really, giving the last
bit of advice,

00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:08.400
telling Pablo to go back.

00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:11.533
They are behind their enemy's
lines so they are actually in

00:31:11.533 --> 00:31:15.933
Fascist nationalist territory,
and he advises Pablo to go

00:31:15.933 --> 00:31:17.567
back to the Spanish Republic.

00:31:17.567 --> 00:31:21.133
But Pablo says no, I'm actually
going to go further

00:31:21.133 --> 00:31:24.167
away from the Spanish
Republic.

00:31:24.167 --> 00:31:25.867
I'm for Grados.

00:31:25.867 --> 00:31:30.633
And actually, it turns out to
be a really smart decision,

00:31:30.633 --> 00:31:34.000
because if they had gone back
to the Spanish Republic they

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.233
would actually all
have been killed.

00:31:36.233 --> 00:31:40.867
So Robert is actually right to
end with the last line, "Thou

00:31:40.867 --> 00:31:44.133
hast much head."

00:31:44.133 --> 00:31:51.667
The symmetry here is between
Robert having a broken leg and

00:31:51.667 --> 00:31:55.267
Pablo having much head.

00:31:55.267 --> 00:31:57.000
He's the brainy one.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:03.367
This is the ultimate rewriting
of the power dynamics in For

00:32:03.367 --> 00:32:04.000
Whom The Bell Tolls.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.800
We've been going along on the
assumption that it's the

00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:09.867
person with the knowledge or
the technology, the person

00:32:09.867 --> 00:32:11.867
with the knowledge of the world,
the person who can

00:32:11.867 --> 00:32:15.000
speak several languages, we've
been going on the assumption

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:20.333
that that person is going to
be on top, that the future

00:32:20.333 --> 00:32:21.667
belongs to him.

00:32:21.667 --> 00:32:27.067
The ultimate irony of this novel
is, in fact, this is the

00:32:27.067 --> 00:32:31.200
person who's going to lose out,
who has no future at all.

00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:35.500
So in many ways we can either
say it is a very brutal

00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:41.267
undoing of everything that
Robert has believed in, or we

00:32:41.267 --> 00:32:46.833
can say it actually is a kind
of inverted, utopian vision,

00:32:46.833 --> 00:32:50.300
that there is still a future for
the Spanish peasants, even

00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:53.233
though they seem so
disadvantaged in a modern

00:32:53.233 --> 00:32:57.033
world, even though they seem
completely incapable of

00:32:57.033 --> 00:33:00.500
functioning outside of their
very limited environment.

00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:03.200
Because they are capable of
functioning within their very

00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:04.467
limited environment.

00:33:04.467 --> 00:33:06.500
Actually, they have a chance
to survive, at least that's

00:33:06.500 --> 00:33:10.267
the narrative that Hemingway's
giving us.

00:33:10.267 --> 00:33:15.100
So a negative utopia for Robert
and a positive utopia

00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:19.100
for Pablo, and it is ironic,
but I don't think that it

00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:19.667
actually is.

00:33:19.667 --> 00:33:23.967
It's fully ironic that Pablo
should be the embodiment of

00:33:23.967 --> 00:33:27.700
some kind of utopian hope
at the end of the novel.

00:33:27.700 --> 00:33:32.833
And just to give you a
comparison for similar use of

00:33:32.833 --> 00:33:35.567
the verb to be in
As I Lay Dying,

00:33:35.567 --> 00:33:37.133
almost exactly the same.

00:33:37.133 --> 00:33:39.200
"Cash has a broken leg.

00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:40.733
He has had two broken legs.

00:33:40.733 --> 00:33:43.800
He lies on the box with a quilt
rolled under his head

00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:46.000
and a piece of wood
under his knee.

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:47.600
"'I reckon we ought to
have left him at

00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:48.733
Armstid's,' pa says.

00:33:48.733 --> 00:33:53.800
'I haven't got a broken leg and
pa hasn't and Darl hasn't

00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:56.200
and 'It's just the bumps,'
Cash says.

00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:56.700
'It kind of grinds together
a little on a bump.

00:33:56.700 --> 00:33:59.367
It don't bother none.'"

00:33:59.367 --> 00:34:00.567
So exactly.

00:34:00.567 --> 00:34:04.233
Hemingway and Fitzgerald have
the same intuition about the

00:34:04.233 --> 00:34:08.167
extent to which the word to
have can be ironized.

00:34:08.167 --> 00:34:15.567
So given the fact that Robert
has arrived at his

00:34:15.567 --> 00:34:19.633
destination, which is this state
of dispossession at the

00:34:19.633 --> 00:34:24.000
end of the novel, we should
not be surprised that that

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:30.833
destination is well prepared
for, some ways, before that.

00:34:30.833 --> 00:34:35.067
So I just want to call your
attention to the narrative

00:34:35.067 --> 00:34:38.800
innovation in For Whom the
Bell Tolls, which is the

00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:43.767
removal of the narrative
from Robert Jordan.

00:34:43.767 --> 00:34:46.367
He doesn't get to
tell the story.

00:34:46.367 --> 00:34:52.833
There are four chapter told by
someone else, quite literally

00:34:52.833 --> 00:34:56.600
cutting off the narrative
from Robert.

00:34:56.600 --> 00:35:00.833
And those four chapters are the
chapters when Andres, who

00:35:00.833 --> 00:35:04.033
is charged with the mission to
go and deliver this very

00:35:04.033 --> 00:35:12.667
important message to the central
command, that actually

00:35:12.667 --> 00:35:15.333
the enemy knew that they were
going to launch this attack,

00:35:15.333 --> 00:35:17.733
that very important information
that was going to

00:35:17.733 --> 00:35:24.867
be conveyed by Andres is told
in four chapters that have

00:35:24.867 --> 00:35:28.400
absolutely nothing to
do with Robert.

00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:32.033
So let me just give you one
instance of that removal of

00:35:32.033 --> 00:35:34.767
the narrative from Robert.

00:35:34.767 --> 00:35:38.867
Chapter 40, he's a non
protagonist, he's a non

00:35:38.867 --> 00:35:43.233
participant, he doesn't show
up at all in that chapter.

00:35:43.233 --> 00:35:46.900
"During the time that Robert
Jordan had slept through, the

00:35:46.900 --> 00:35:50.467
time he had spent planning the
destruction of the bridge and

00:35:50.467 --> 00:35:53.000
the time that he had been
with Maria, Andres

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:56.133
had made slow progress.

00:35:56.133 --> 00:35:58.433
Until he had reached the
Republican lines he had

00:35:58.433 --> 00:36:01.633
travelled across country and
through the fascist lines as

00:36:01.633 --> 00:36:05.067
fast as a countryman in good
physical condition who knew

00:36:05.067 --> 00:36:07.900
the country well could
travel in the dark.

00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:11.767
But once inside Republican lines
it went very slowly."

00:36:11.767 --> 00:36:16.633
So there's irony right here,
that we detect, that for

00:36:16.633 --> 00:36:20.900
Andres, this is very dramatic,
because actually it takes so

00:36:20.900 --> 00:36:24.333
much more time to travel
through, supposedly, your own

00:36:24.333 --> 00:36:27.500
side, because he's questioned
and detained by everyone.

00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:31.100
Whereas it's much faster to go
through enemy terrain because

00:36:31.100 --> 00:36:34.533
it's just traveling as someone
who is physically fit can

00:36:34.533 --> 00:36:36.567
travel, which is very fast.

00:36:36.567 --> 00:36:42.233
So those four chapters, 34,
36, 40, and 42, those four

00:36:42.233 --> 00:36:47.433
chapters are devoted to the
irony of how slow it is and

00:36:47.433 --> 00:36:50.867
how impossible it is for
Andres to deliver

00:36:50.867 --> 00:36:54.133
that crucial message.

00:36:54.133 --> 00:37:01.333
But the other additional irony
is that Robert is fast

00:37:01.333 --> 00:37:07.167
becoming a non-protagonist in
his own narrative, which is

00:37:07.167 --> 00:37:09.600
very much a prelude
to the end.

00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:12.700
At the end of For Whom the Bell
Tolls he will be a non

00:37:12.700 --> 00:37:16.267
player in the future of
the Spanish Republic.

00:37:16.267 --> 00:37:19.600
He will be a non-player in
Maria's life, in Pablo's life,

00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:22.467
in everyone's life.

00:37:22.467 --> 00:37:27.367
And Hemingway has already paved
the way for Robert being

00:37:27.367 --> 00:37:29.800
a non-player much earlier.

00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:33.467
So we can think back to many
other instances of someone

00:37:33.467 --> 00:37:35.000
being a non player.

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:38.867
In "Soldier's Home" in In
Our Time, Krebs being a

00:37:38.867 --> 00:37:43.833
non-player, his sister playing
basketball and Krebs being on

00:37:43.833 --> 00:37:45.933
the sideline, being
a non-player.

00:37:45.933 --> 00:37:50.000
So Hemingway has given a lot of
thought for what it means

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:54.200
for a man who once used to be
an important player to be

00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:57.967
relegated to the sidelines and
to suffer the fate of being a

00:37:57.967 --> 00:37:58.900
non-player.

00:37:58.900 --> 00:38:03.000
And he is enacting that
one more time in For

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.033
Whom the Bell Tolls.

00:38:05.033 --> 00:38:09.600
So I just wanted to highlight
the interconnections among

00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:11.933
Hemingway's works.

00:38:11.933 --> 00:38:15.467
This is not the first time
when he has removed the

00:38:15.467 --> 00:38:20.933
narrative from the supposed
protagonist of that narrative.

00:38:20.933 --> 00:38:26.800
In To Have and Have Not a
similar fate has been visited

00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:28.500
upon Harry Morgan.

00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:31.967
So in chapters one to five, told
from Harry Morgan's point

00:38:31.967 --> 00:38:35.067
of view, chapter six, all
of a sudden, he's

00:38:35.067 --> 00:38:38.133
referred to as a man.

00:38:38.133 --> 00:38:40.167
"'You ain't gonna fix me
up,' the nigger said.

00:38:40.167 --> 00:38:43.400
The man, whose name was Harry
Morgan, said nothing back,

00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:45.433
because he liked the nigger and
there was nothing to do

00:38:45.433 --> 00:38:47.600
now but hit him, and he
couldn't hit him."

00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:49.833
When we were talking about
this passage we said that

00:38:49.833 --> 00:38:54.867
suddenly Harry becomes Harry
Morgan, someone looked at

00:38:54.867 --> 00:38:59.067
completely from the outside,
and who is, in fact, put in

00:38:59.067 --> 00:39:01.867
the same position as
the black person.

00:39:01.867 --> 00:39:04.867
They've both lost something.

00:39:04.867 --> 00:39:12.633
And in a more abstract way, we
can also just go back to that

00:39:12.633 --> 00:39:17.300
moment at the very end of
For Whom the Bell Tolls.

00:39:17.300 --> 00:39:20.400
Robert is still Robert Jordan.

00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:23.467
He never gets to the
stage where he

00:39:23.467 --> 00:39:25.633
can simply be a Robert.

00:39:25.633 --> 00:39:30.200
He's still referred to in
that alienating form.

00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:35.200
So that, too, the structure is
very much similar to the

00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:37.300
alienating device in To
Have and Have Not.

00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:47.133
I think that I've done
everything that I can to make

00:39:47.133 --> 00:39:51.533
a case for To Have and Have
Not as a novel of

00:39:51.533 --> 00:39:52.867
dispossession.

00:39:52.867 --> 00:39:57.167
That basically Robert emerges as
completely empty handed at

00:39:57.167 --> 00:39:59.400
the end of the novel.

00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:03.133
He's lost his leg, he's
lost Maria, he's

00:40:03.133 --> 00:40:05.367
about to lose his life.

00:40:05.367 --> 00:40:08.867
He's lost even a novel that
is supposedly his.

00:40:08.867 --> 00:40:14.633
So it is a loss, almost
completely equal, to the loss

00:40:14.633 --> 00:40:18.933
of Darl at the end of
As I Lay Dying.

00:40:18.933 --> 00:40:24.933
And it really is possible read
both Hemingway and Faulkner as

00:40:24.933 --> 00:40:29.667
authors who have dedicated to
the bleakest vision possible

00:40:29.667 --> 00:40:32.000
of human possibilities.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:38.600
But I want to, now, make the
opposite case, which is that

00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:40.467
it's not quite as
bleak as that.

00:40:40.467 --> 00:40:42.567
That maybe there's a way in
which we can think about the

00:40:42.567 --> 00:40:49.400
verb to have as a somewhat
non-ironic word.

00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:53.967
And also, that there's a way to
read the narrative not as

00:40:53.967 --> 00:40:59.467
one that highlights or maybe
passes the damning verdict

00:40:59.467 --> 00:41:03.167
that there really is nothing
at the end for Robert.

00:41:03.167 --> 00:41:05.833
So trying to recover something
for Robert at

00:41:05.833 --> 00:41:08.400
the end of the narrative.

00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:12.767
So it turns out that Hemingway
is also quite self conscious

00:41:12.767 --> 00:41:19.333
about using to verb to have
as a non-ironic verb.

00:41:19.333 --> 00:41:22.667
This is a little earlier, so
it has the disadvantage of

00:41:22.667 --> 00:41:26.233
coming before that final very
ironic moment, but it's still

00:41:26.233 --> 00:41:28.933
a moment we should look at.

00:41:28.933 --> 00:41:29.300
"And another thing.

00:41:29.300 --> 00:41:32.933
Don't ever kid yourself
about loving someone.

00:41:32.933 --> 00:41:35.833
It is just that most people
are not lucky enough

00:41:35.833 --> 00:41:37.700
ever to have it.

00:41:37.700 --> 00:41:41.567
You never had it before
and now you have it.

00:41:41.567 --> 00:41:44.900
What you have with Maria,
whether it last just through

00:41:44.900 --> 00:41:48.700
today and a part of tomorrow, or
whether it lasts for a long

00:41:48.700 --> 00:41:52.433
life, is the most important
thing that can happen to a

00:41:52.433 --> 00:41:53.733
human being.

00:41:53.733 --> 00:41:57.000
There will always be people
who say it does not exist

00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:58.933
because they cannot have it.

00:41:58.933 --> 00:42:03.300
But I tell you it is true that
you have it and that you are

00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:07.200
lucky even if you
die tomorrow."

00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:14.867
So this is, relatively speaking,
an instance where we

00:42:14.867 --> 00:42:20.800
have the verb to have in an
unironic, non-ironic mode,

00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:25.567
that it's affirming the privacy
and the durability of

00:42:25.567 --> 00:42:31.600
what he had, or has, or
continues to have with Maria.

00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:36.867
But we also know that, even in
this non-ironic moment, the

00:42:36.867 --> 00:42:40.567
verb to have is very
precarious.

00:42:40.567 --> 00:42:45.567
It is precarious because it is
so much dependent on being

00:42:45.567 --> 00:42:50.100
able to refute other people who
would not credit you with

00:42:50.100 --> 00:42:51.600
having that thing.

00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:55.233
So it is this consciousness
that there will always be

00:42:55.233 --> 00:42:58.633
people who say it does
not exist because

00:42:58.633 --> 00:43:00.567
they cannot have it.

00:43:00.567 --> 00:43:05.667
Because what you have here, what
Robert has here, is so

00:43:05.667 --> 00:43:10.333
intangible, because there's
really no material way to

00:43:10.333 --> 00:43:11.167
demonstrate it.

00:43:11.167 --> 00:43:15.267
It is there, it simply
is not a physical

00:43:15.267 --> 00:43:17.500
object in the world.

00:43:17.500 --> 00:43:21.800
There's no material evidence
that it is a

00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:25.133
thing in the world.

00:43:25.133 --> 00:43:28.967
All you have is your subjective
intuition that you

00:43:28.967 --> 00:43:31.833
did have it, that you
continue to have it.

00:43:31.833 --> 00:43:34.600
And then having it makes
all the difference.

00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:37.567
It is only a subjective
conviction.

00:43:37.567 --> 00:43:43.000
It doesn't carry the weight of
objective demonstrability.

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:46.700
And so that is one strike
against it, that other people

00:43:46.700 --> 00:43:49.600
will not be persuaded by the
fact that you did have it.

00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:52.100
They will continue to tell
you that you didn't.

00:43:52.100 --> 00:43:56.733
The other thing, which I think
actually plays out on a formal

00:43:56.733 --> 00:43:58.467
level, has to do with
the switch of

00:43:58.467 --> 00:44:00.967
pronouns in this passage.

00:44:05.367 --> 00:44:07.800
All the way through this passage
the pronouns are

00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:09.400
already switched.

00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:12.833
Even though Robert has been
just talking in the first

00:44:12.833 --> 00:44:18.700
person singular, I, in this
critical moment he's actually

00:44:18.700 --> 00:44:22.500
referring to himself as you.

00:44:22.500 --> 00:44:27.400
"You never had it before
and now you have it."

00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:31.967
And even more powerfully in the
last line, where we see

00:44:31.967 --> 00:44:36.300
both the pronoun I and the
pronoun you, "But I tell you

00:44:36.300 --> 00:44:40.467
it is true that you have it and
that you're lucky even if

00:44:40.467 --> 00:44:44.867
you die tomorrow." The
co-presence of the pronoun I

00:44:44.867 --> 00:44:48.867
and the pronoun you suggest
that it is an effort.

00:44:48.867 --> 00:44:51.400
It takes some real power
to convince himself

00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:52.933
that he did have it.

00:44:52.933 --> 00:44:55.067
I'm telling you that
you did have it.

00:44:55.067 --> 00:44:56.267
It's not just that other people
are not persuaded, but

00:44:56.267 --> 00:45:00.467
Robert himself has to be
convinced, he has to be beaten

00:45:00.467 --> 00:45:06.533
over the head by this other I
to believe that, yes, that

00:45:06.533 --> 00:45:10.300
what he did have with Maria
does make a difference and

00:45:10.300 --> 00:45:12.400
does make him a "have."

00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:14.933
So because of those two
considerations I would say

00:45:14.933 --> 00:45:19.767
that this is a non-ironic use
of the word "to have," but

00:45:19.767 --> 00:45:22.767
heavily circumscribed with other
possibilities looming

00:45:22.767 --> 00:45:24.033
heavily on the horizon.

00:45:26.567 --> 00:45:33.433
And it's replayed in the very
last moment of the novel.

00:45:33.433 --> 00:45:36.567
"He looked down the hill slope
again and he thought, I hate

00:45:36.567 --> 00:45:37.900
to leave it, is all.

00:45:37.900 --> 00:45:41.033
I hate to leave it very much
and I hope I have done some

00:45:41.033 --> 00:45:41.900
good in it.

00:45:41.900 --> 00:45:45.200
I have tried to with
what talent I had.

00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:46.400
Have, you mean.

00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:50.333
All right, have. I have fought
for what I believed

00:45:50.333 --> 00:45:51.733
in for a year now.

00:45:51.733 --> 00:45:53.967
If we win here we will
win everywhere.

00:45:53.967 --> 00:45:57.133
The world is a fine place and
worth the fighting for and I

00:45:57.133 --> 00:45:59.433
hate very much to leave it.

00:45:59.433 --> 00:46:02.867
And you had a lot of luck, he
told himself, to have had such

00:46:02.867 --> 00:46:03.900
a good life.

00:46:03.900 --> 00:46:06.633
You've had just as good a
life as grandfather's

00:46:06.633 --> 00:46:08.000
though not so long.

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:11.400
You've had just as good a life
as any one because of these

00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:11.867
last days."

00:46:11.867 --> 00:46:16.867
So once again, non-ironic use
of the verb to have, but

00:46:16.867 --> 00:46:21.500
taking an effort of the will
to convince himself.

00:46:21.500 --> 00:46:25.333
He has to be told you've had
as good a life as your

00:46:25.333 --> 00:46:25.533
grandfather.

00:46:25.533 --> 00:46:29.700
You've had as good
a life as anyone.

00:46:29.700 --> 00:46:34.533
It has to be a command issued
by part of himself.

00:46:34.533 --> 00:46:43.100
And so it takes that form, that
it is not a natural or

00:46:43.100 --> 00:46:45.733
unselfconscious conviction.

00:46:45.733 --> 00:46:49.733
It's a conviction arrived at
through some struggle and with

00:46:49.733 --> 00:46:51.333
quite a bit of effort.

00:46:51.333 --> 00:46:59.133
So Robert, I think, is actually
a very fragile

00:46:59.133 --> 00:47:05.900
vehicle as a representative of
a narrative of repossession,

00:47:05.900 --> 00:47:08.133
just because he's
so vulnerable at

00:47:08.133 --> 00:47:09.967
the end of the novel.

00:47:09.967 --> 00:47:14.700
But I think that Hemingway
actually has stepped in and

00:47:14.700 --> 00:47:19.867
provided one form of authority
or intervention that allows

00:47:19.867 --> 00:47:24.767
us, possibly, to read the novel
as affirming something

00:47:24.767 --> 00:47:28.367
about Robert, so that he's
not totally a loser at

00:47:28.367 --> 00:47:29.700
the end of the novel.

00:47:29.700 --> 00:47:34.767
And that has to do with a very
stylized, very deliberate

00:47:34.767 --> 00:47:38.600
narrative structure of
For Whom the Tolls.

00:47:38.600 --> 00:47:44.000
You notice that the first line
of the novel reads, "He lay

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:45.300
flat on the brown, pine-needled
floor of the

00:47:45.300 --> 00:47:52.233
forest, his chin on his folded
arms, and high over head the

00:47:52.233 --> 00:47:56.833
wind blew in the top of pine
trees." And the very last of

00:47:56.833 --> 00:48:00.967
the novel, "He could feel his
heart beating against the pine

00:48:00.967 --> 00:48:03.633
needle floor of the forest."

00:48:03.633 --> 00:48:09.800
So Robert's totally alone, but
in the end is the beginning.

00:48:09.800 --> 00:48:16.233
And so it is that impersonal
narrative structure

00:48:16.233 --> 00:48:17.700
that he's not dead.

00:48:17.700 --> 00:48:21.200
It's almost as if he were
beginning all over again, that

00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:24.800
the story is going
to begin anew.

00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:32.533
It is that formal structure, the
formal mirror effect, that

00:48:32.533 --> 00:48:37.333
allows us to entertain the
illusion that not all is over,

00:48:37.333 --> 00:48:40.667
even though we know that
physically it is over, that

00:48:40.667 --> 00:48:43.300
there's no way it could have
a different ending or that

00:48:43.300 --> 00:48:44.767
things could go on.

00:48:44.767 --> 00:48:48.000
But nonetheless, the form of
the narrative is such, it

00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:50.967
feels like the beginning
rather than the end.

00:48:50.967 --> 00:48:55.400
And maybe this is really the
best that Hemingway can do for

00:48:55.400 --> 00:48:59.133
Robert, is for the reader
to want this to be a new

00:48:59.133 --> 00:49:01.467
beginning, and for the
reader to feel that

00:49:01.467 --> 00:49:03.233
this isn't the end.

00:49:03.233 --> 00:49:04.500
This is the best that we
can do for Robert.

00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:03.185
Prof: So I'm going to be
pointing to the board,

00:00:03.185 --> 00:00:04.000
at least in theory.
 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.040
I suppose I expect to be
pointing to the board a little

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.120
bit more today than ordinarily.
 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.350
The usual function of my
[chalk]

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.884
equivalent of Power Point isn't
quite the same today because I'm

00:00:18.884 --> 00:00:23.058
taking an interest in some of
these diagrammatic matters as

00:00:23.058 --> 00:00:26.757
well and,
as I say, I will be pointing to

00:00:26.757 --> 00:00:27.250
them.
 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:28.043
All right.
 

00:00:28.043 --> 00:00:32.488
So to begin I'm actually going
to postpone something that

00:00:32.488 --> 00:00:35.980
you're probably already
wondering about,

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.886
although it will come into this
lecture on a couple of

00:00:38.886 --> 00:00:40.825
occasions--
that is to say,

00:00:40.825 --> 00:00:45.236
the full relationship in terms
of the influence of both

00:00:45.236 --> 00:00:49.168
movements--
between the Russian formalists

00:00:49.168 --> 00:00:53.910
and Saussure's notion of
semiology and semiotics--

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.930
until next week when we discuss
Roman Jakobson's essay,

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.354
"Linguistics and
Poetics,"

00:01:01.354 --> 00:01:05.373
where I think the relationship
between the two movements in

00:01:05.373 --> 00:01:09.322
which he himself was involved
will become clearer and will

00:01:09.322 --> 00:01:13.549
come into focus more naturally
than if I tried to outline what

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:17.430
the connection between the two
movements is now.

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.355
So that is an aspect of our
sequence of lectures,

00:01:21.355 --> 00:01:25.935
beginning with the last one,
that will be postponed until

00:01:25.935 --> 00:01:27.080
next week.
 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:34.069
Now semiotics is not in itself
a literary theory.

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:37.099
As we'll learn from Jakobson
next week,

00:01:37.099 --> 00:01:39.976
literature can be
understood--or what he calls the

00:01:39.976 --> 00:01:42.560
study of literature,
"poetics"--

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.230
can be understood as a subfield
of semiotics,

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:51.069
but semiotics is not in itself
a literary theory.

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:53.405
In other words,
perhaps to your frustration,

00:01:53.405 --> 00:01:56.447
what you read today has nothing
at all, in and of itself,

00:01:56.447 --> 00:01:58.239
to tell you about literature.
 

00:01:58.239 --> 00:02:01.503
This isn't the last time this
will happen during the course of

00:02:01.503 --> 00:02:03.661
the syllabus,
but then of course,

00:02:03.661 --> 00:02:07.563
our job is to bring out the
implications for literature of

00:02:07.563 --> 00:02:11.330
texts that we read that don't
have any direct bearing on

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:12.699
literary study.
 

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:17.870
The important thing about
Saussure and the discipline of

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:23.038
semiotics is the incredible
influence that it has had on

00:02:23.038 --> 00:02:28.210
virtually every form of
subsequent literary theory.

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:30.008
That's what we need to keep in
mind.

00:02:30.008 --> 00:02:32.388
Semiotics evolves into what is
called

00:02:32.388 --> 00:02:36.155
"structuralism,"
which we'll be considering next

00:02:36.155 --> 00:02:36.750
week.
 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.383
That in turn,
as it were, bequeaths its

00:02:40.383 --> 00:02:45.259
terminology and its set of
issues and frameworks for

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:51.461
thinking to deconstruction,
to Lacanian psychoanalysis,

00:02:51.461 --> 00:02:56.580
to French Marxism,
and to binary theories of race,

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.022
colonization and gender--
in other words,

00:03:00.022 --> 00:03:04.437
to a great deal that we will be
studying subsequently on this

00:03:04.437 --> 00:03:05.318
syllabus.
 

00:03:05.318 --> 00:03:10.292
So while again,
what we read for today is not

00:03:10.292 --> 00:03:15.479
in itself literary theory,
it is nevertheless crucially

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:19.367
formative for a great many of
the developments in literary

00:03:19.367 --> 00:03:21.620
theory that we'll be studying.
 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:26.800
Now as an anecdotal or
conjectural aside--

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.908
I've always found this so
fascinating I can never resist

00:03:29.908 --> 00:03:35.515
talking about it--
there are various texts in our

00:03:35.515 --> 00:03:37.989
field--
the history of criticism,

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:40.670
literary theory--
texts that are considered

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.628
foundational but which curiously
enough,

00:03:43.628 --> 00:03:48.128
a la Foucault,
don't actually have an author.

00:03:48.128 --> 00:03:53.133
Aristotle's Poetics we
know actually not to have been

00:03:53.133 --> 00:03:57.797
one of the texts written by
Aristotle but rather to be a

00:03:57.797 --> 00:04:02.968
compendium of lecture notes put
together by his students.

00:04:02.968 --> 00:04:06.900
This is one of the reasons why
in the golden age of Arabic

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.175
scholarship in the Middle Ages,
there was so much dispute about

00:04:11.175 --> 00:04:14.250
the Poetics.
The manuscripts we find from

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.293
this period are full of marginal
notes where the scholars are

00:04:17.293 --> 00:04:19.473
chiding each other and saying,
"No, no,

00:04:19.473 --> 00:04:19.625
no.
 

00:04:19.625 --> 00:04:21.300
It can't be that way."
 

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:24.557
In other words,
in a way it's a disputed text

00:04:24.557 --> 00:04:28.259
and it is not written by
Aristotle, but it's also a

00:04:28.259 --> 00:04:29.889
foundational text.
 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:33.800
Aristotle is considered the
"father of criticism,"

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.718
and yet he is also what
Foucault would call a

00:04:36.718 --> 00:04:39.370
"founder of
discursivity."

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:43.560
Well, the odd thing is it's
exactly the same with Saussure,

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.300
who can be considered the
father or patriarch of a certain

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.649
kind of literary theory as I
have just indicated.

00:04:50.649 --> 00:04:55.831
Saussure's Course in General
Linguistics is not something

00:04:55.831 --> 00:05:00.355
written by Saussure but is a
compendium of lecture notes

00:05:00.355 --> 00:05:05.208
written by his students in a
series of lectures that he gave

00:05:05.208 --> 00:05:09.814
from 1906 to 1911 and then
gathered together in book form

00:05:09.814 --> 00:05:14.009
by two of his disciples who were
linguists.

00:05:14.009 --> 00:05:20.567
Now it's odd that this text
does have the same formative

00:05:20.567 --> 00:05:21.879
function.
 

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:25.728
Scholars who go to Geneva go
for a variety of reasons when

00:05:25.728 --> 00:05:28.160
they look at the Saussure
archive.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:32.300
Some of them are predisposed to
dislike Saussure and to hope

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:36.298
that they can somehow discredit
him by learning more about

00:05:36.298 --> 00:05:40.509
things that he thought that
aren't actually in the text.

00:05:40.509 --> 00:05:43.694
Others like Saussure and feel
that he needs to be rescued

00:05:43.694 --> 00:05:45.060
&gt;
 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.877
from his compositors,
and yet others go in an

00:05:48.877 --> 00:05:53.908
attitude of worship and hope
that the archive will yield to

00:05:53.908 --> 00:05:58.942
them full confirmation of the
integrity of the text we call

00:05:58.942 --> 00:06:03.019
the Course in General
Linguistics;

00:06:03.019 --> 00:06:06.411
so that in a way,
the study of the Saussure

00:06:06.411 --> 00:06:09.129
archive,
given the volatile relationship

00:06:09.129 --> 00:06:12.199
of that archive with the actual
text that we have,

00:06:12.199 --> 00:06:17.199
is a kind of map that,
if one were to study it,

00:06:17.199 --> 00:06:20.656
one could associate with the
history of thinking about

00:06:20.656 --> 00:06:23.459
literary theory in the twentieth
century.

00:06:23.459 --> 00:06:25.970
This is really all neither here
nor there.

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:29.654
I just find it interesting that
two people who are incontestably

00:06:29.654 --> 00:06:31.060
&gt;
 

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:35.023
founders of discursivity in the
field that we study are in fact

00:06:35.023 --> 00:06:38.540
not strictly speaking authors,
&gt;

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:43.708
somehow or another confirming
the insight of Foucault in the

00:06:43.708 --> 00:06:46.600
essay that we began by reading.
 

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:47.889
Anyway, enough of that.
 

00:06:47.889 --> 00:06:51.490
We have to try to figure out
what Saussure is up to.

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:55.120
Let's move on to begin to do so.
 

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:59.180
What is semiology?
 

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:03.435
It's the study of existing,
conventional,

00:07:03.435 --> 00:07:05.990
communicative systems.
 

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:09.071
All of these systems we can
call "languages,"

00:07:09.071 --> 00:07:11.422
and "language"--
that is to say,

00:07:11.422 --> 00:07:14.029
the words that we use when we
speak to each other--

00:07:14.029 --> 00:07:16.740
is one of those systems.
 

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:20.550
Other systems:
the gestures that mimes use,

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:25.267
semaphores, railroad semaphores
and a stoplight--red,

00:07:25.267 --> 00:07:29.259
green, yellow--are all semiotic
systems.

00:07:29.259 --> 00:07:31.860
In other words,
all of them are modes of

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:34.529
communication with which we
function,

00:07:34.529 --> 00:07:39.346
the intelligibility of which
allows us to negotiate the world

00:07:39.346 --> 00:07:40.310
around us.
 

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:45.786
Semiotics has expanded into
every imaginable aspect of

00:07:45.786 --> 00:07:46.819
thought.
 

00:07:46.819 --> 00:07:51.644
There is a Darwinian semiotics,
understanding the relationships

00:07:51.644 --> 00:07:54.290
among species in semiotic terms.
 

00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:59.682
There is, in other words,
a semiotics of virtually every

00:07:59.682 --> 00:08:05.860
imaginable thing understood as a
language made up of a system of

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:08.978
signs--
signs we'll be getting to in a

00:08:08.978 --> 00:08:11.156
minute--
but in the meantime,

00:08:11.156 --> 00:08:15.620
it's important to understand
what semiology actually is.

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:17.980
That's what it is.
 

00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:19.459
Oh, I meant to ask you.
 

00:08:19.459 --> 00:08:24.252
How many of you did not bring
the passages that I sent to you

00:08:24.252 --> 00:08:26.089
by e-mail last night?
 

00:08:26.089 --> 00:08:26.860
All right.
 

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:29.778
We have them here and they'll
be passed around.

00:08:29.778 --> 00:08:33.011
We have about twenty-five
copies, so don't take one if you

00:08:33.011 --> 00:08:33.918
don't need it.
 

00:08:33.918 --> 00:08:40.932
I am going to be turning to the
second passage on the sheet in

00:08:40.932 --> 00:08:46.566
which something about the nature
of these systems,

00:08:46.566 --> 00:08:50.129
I think, can be made clear.
 

00:08:50.129 --> 00:08:53.232
"Language,"
says Saussure,

00:08:53.232 --> 00:08:57.399
"is not a function of the
speaker."

00:08:57.399 --> 00:09:00.330
Here of course he is talking
about human language.

00:09:03.658 --> 00:09:08.211
"It is a product that is
passively assimilated by the

00:09:08.211 --> 00:09:09.730
individual."
 

00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:11.408
Now what does this mean?
 

00:09:11.408 --> 00:09:16.399
The fact that human language is
not my language--

00:09:16.399 --> 00:09:19.042
that is to say,
the fact that it doesn't

00:09:19.042 --> 00:09:21.812
originate in me,
the fact that it's not,

00:09:21.812 --> 00:09:25.181
in other words,
my private language--suggests,

00:09:25.181 --> 00:09:28.265
of course,
a certain loss because it means

00:09:28.265 --> 00:09:31.875
that when I speak,
when I use language in speech,

00:09:31.875 --> 00:09:35.480
I'm using something that is not
strictly my own.

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:39.711
It's conventional--that is to
say, it belongs in the public

00:09:39.711 --> 00:09:43.288
sphere to all of us,
and there's perhaps a certain

00:09:43.288 --> 00:09:45.769
sort of Romantic loss in that.
 

00:09:45.769 --> 00:09:50.009
Wouldn't it be nice if language
in some sense were my own?

00:09:50.009 --> 00:09:54.585
But the incredible gain which
makes language something like

00:09:54.585 --> 00:09:59.240
the object of science that
Saussure is hoping to secure--

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:01.259
this is one of the things,
obviously,

00:10:01.259 --> 00:10:03.058
that he has in common with the
formalists--

00:10:03.058 --> 00:10:06.840
the incredible gain is that if
language is not private,

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:09.802
if it's not my own,
if it's not something that I

00:10:09.802 --> 00:10:13.761
can make up as I go along,
and if, in other words,

00:10:13.761 --> 00:10:17.567
it is conventional,
belonging to all of us,

00:10:17.567 --> 00:10:22.250
then that's precisely what
allows it to be communicative.

00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:25.399
It is a system of signs,
in other words,

00:10:25.399 --> 00:10:30.263
that we can make use of,
that we recognize as signs

00:10:30.263 --> 00:10:35.904
precisely because they exist
among us as something that can

00:10:35.904 --> 00:10:38.240
be shared in common.
 

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:44.956
This then is the object of
Saussure's attention as a

00:10:44.956 --> 00:10:49.168
linguist and as a semiotician.
 

00:10:49.168 --> 00:10:56.985
Now what's implied in this idea
is that language is something

00:10:56.985 --> 00:10:58.808
that we use.
 

00:10:58.808 --> 00:11:05.001
The best way to say it and the
quickest way to say it is that I

00:11:05.001 --> 00:11:07.298
don't speak language.
 

00:11:07.298 --> 00:11:12.878
Language as something that
exists as an aggregate all at

00:11:12.878 --> 00:11:15.764
once,
arguably--and this is something

00:11:15.764 --> 00:11:19.577
that's going to come up again
and again as we come back to

00:11:19.577 --> 00:11:23.591
these coordinates that we'll be
touching on from time to time

00:11:23.591 --> 00:11:26.216
today also--
arguably, language as an

00:11:26.216 --> 00:11:28.200
aggregate is something virtual.
 

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:32.313
You remember that Freud said we
have to infer the unconscious

00:11:32.313 --> 00:11:35.399
from the erratic behavior of
consciousness.

00:11:35.399 --> 00:11:37.427
There's got to be something
back there, so we're going to

00:11:37.427 --> 00:11:38.658
call it "the
unconscious"

00:11:38.658 --> 00:11:40.178
and we're going to try to
describe it.

00:11:40.178 --> 00:11:42.875
It is very much the same with
language, or "langue"

00:11:42.875 --> 00:11:43.908
as Saussure calls it.
 

00:11:43.908 --> 00:11:48.710
What we do is
speak, and when we speak,

00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:51.613
of course, we say correctly
that we "use"

00:11:51.613 --> 00:11:53.832
language,
but we still need to know what

00:11:53.832 --> 00:11:56.524
language is and we need to
understand the relationship

00:11:56.524 --> 00:11:58.100
between language and speech.
 

00:11:58.100 --> 00:12:02.687
Now we can understand language
as a kind of aggregate of

00:12:02.687 --> 00:12:05.690
everything that's in the
lexicon,

00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:09.926
in the dictionary,
together with everything that

00:12:09.926 --> 00:12:15.335
would be in some sort of ideal
or utterly systematized set of

00:12:15.335 --> 00:12:21.827
rules of grammar and syntax,
but there is no real aggregate

00:12:21.827 --> 00:12:23.470
of that kind.
 

00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:26.913
In other words,
it exists, it's there to be put

00:12:26.913 --> 00:12:31.105
together partly as a matter of
experiment and partly as a

00:12:31.105 --> 00:12:34.250
matter of conjecture by the
linguists;

00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:39.428
but as a composite thing
existing in a spatial

00:12:39.428 --> 00:12:43.331
simultaneity,
synchronically,

00:12:43.331 --> 00:12:48.019
language is something that in a
very real sense,

00:12:48.019 --> 00:12:49.570
as is the case with Freud's
unconscious,

00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:50.990
we infer from speech.
 

00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:52.720
Now speech is what we do.
 

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:57.820
Speech is the way in which we
appropriate, deploy and make use

00:12:57.820 --> 00:13:02.668
of language, and Saussure calls
that "parole."

00:13:02.668 --> 00:13:06.958
Parole is the unfolding
in time of a set of

00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:13.235
possibilities given in space,
that set of possibilities being

00:13:13.235 --> 00:13:17.720
what Saussure calls
"langue."

00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:22.549
Now language is a system of
signs.

00:13:22.549 --> 00:13:25.000
What is a sign?
 

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.600
Saussure's famous diagrams make
it clear enough.

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:34.105
[Gestures to board.]
We have above the line a

00:13:34.105 --> 00:13:39.330
concept and we have below the
line a sound image.

00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:44.109
In other words,
I think of something and that

00:13:44.109 --> 00:13:49.431
thinking of something
corresponds to a sound image

00:13:49.431 --> 00:13:53.450
that I have ready to hand for
it.

00:13:53.450 --> 00:13:57.884
That can be understood in terms
of thinking of the concept

00:13:57.884 --> 00:14:01.403
"tree"--
that's why this is in quotation

00:14:01.403 --> 00:14:05.663
marks,
I speak Latin--and knowing that

00:14:05.663 --> 00:14:11.597
the sound image correlative to
the concept tree is

00:14:11.597 --> 00:14:15.110
"arbor,"
right,

00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:17.220
I can think of
&gt;

00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:21.573
something like that [drawing of
a tree], something in some way

00:14:21.573 --> 00:14:22.860
resembling that.
 

00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:27.129
By the same token--I still
speak Latin--the sound image

00:14:27.129 --> 00:14:30.528
corresponding to it is
"arbor."

00:14:30.528 --> 00:14:34.279
I may or may not get back to
this today,

00:14:34.279 --> 00:14:35.335
but in this question mark [on
the board next to a sign diagram

00:14:35.335 --> 00:14:36.304
in which the signified tree is
written over the signifier

00:14:36.304 --> 00:14:37.014
arbor, neither of them in
quotation marks]

00:14:37.014 --> 00:14:37.690
is the secret of
deconstruction,

00:14:37.690 --> 00:14:40.759
all right?-- just
&gt;

00:14:40.759 --> 00:14:44.210
to keep you poised and on
tenterhooks.

00:14:44.210 --> 00:14:46.869
In the meantime,
what Saussure is doing with

00:14:46.869 --> 00:14:49.899
this relationship above and
below the line is,

00:14:49.899 --> 00:14:54.260
he is saying that there is an
arbitrary relationship

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:57.418
between the concept and the
sound image.

00:14:57.418 --> 00:15:01.623
The concept he calls a
"signified"

00:15:01.623 --> 00:15:07.000
and the sound image he calls a
"signifier."

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:13.129
A sign, in other words,
is made up of two sides in,

00:15:13.129 --> 00:15:18.302
as it were, a thought moment:
a relationship between that

00:15:18.302 --> 00:15:22.830
which is signified and that
which signifies it.

00:15:22.830 --> 00:15:27.129
It's to be understood that we
have to think of them together.

00:15:27.129 --> 00:15:28.538
They're not divisible.
 

00:15:28.538 --> 00:15:33.643
Their relationship is necessary
but, as we'll see in a minute,

00:15:33.643 --> 00:15:36.990
arbitrary, and each sign is
like that.

00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:42.438
The way in which we put signs
together is to take these

00:15:42.438 --> 00:15:45.669
bundles,
these binary relationships

00:15:45.669 --> 00:15:48.769
between a concept and a sound
image,

00:15:48.769 --> 00:15:52.950
and adjust them in an unfolding
sequence.

00:15:52.950 --> 00:15:53.860
That's how we speak.
 

00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:58.000
That's how we make a sentence.
 

00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.120
All right.
 

00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:04.690
So in a way the idea that a
signifier,

00:16:04.690 --> 00:16:08.966
a sound that I make,
arbor,

00:16:08.966 --> 00:16:15.320
refers to a concept and
by implication,

00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:18.379
by a very powerful and strong
and necessary implication,

00:16:18.379 --> 00:16:24.428
not to a thing--is not
in itself new.

00:16:24.428 --> 00:16:29.625
The idea that a word signifies
an idea and not an object is

00:16:29.625 --> 00:16:34.644
already fully developed in John
Locke's Essay on Human

00:16:34.644 --> 00:16:40.019
Understanding and is more or
less commonly agreed on ever

00:16:40.019 --> 00:16:44.336
afterwards and is,
as I say, in itself a

00:16:44.336 --> 00:16:49.676
conventional thought that
Saussure adapts and makes use

00:16:49.676 --> 00:16:50.269
of.
 

00:16:50.269 --> 00:16:57.187
But what is new in Saussure and
what really is foundational in

00:16:57.187 --> 00:17:03.879
semiotics as a science is two
things that Saussure then goes

00:17:03.879 --> 00:17:07.170
on to say about the sign.
 

00:17:07.170 --> 00:17:13.794
The first thing he has to say
is that the signified-signifier

00:17:13.794 --> 00:17:18.210
relationship,
as I said, is arbitrary.

00:17:18.210 --> 00:17:23.673
And the second thing he has to
say is that the way in which we

00:17:23.673 --> 00:17:29.611
know one sign from another--
either studying language in the

00:17:29.611 --> 00:17:34.509
aggregate,
whereby clusters of signs exist

00:17:34.509 --> 00:17:39.440
in associational relation to
each other,

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:44.430
or studying it in speech acts,
in speech,

00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:49.368
whereby signs exist next to
each other in a sequence--

00:17:49.368 --> 00:17:54.467
the way in which we understand
what a sign means is

00:17:54.467 --> 00:17:56.710
differential.
 

00:17:56.710 --> 00:18:00.605
So that what's new in
Saussure's thinking about the

00:18:00.605 --> 00:18:05.280
relationship between signified
and signifier is that the sign

00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:10.578
tied up in this relationship is
both arbitrary and differential.

00:18:10.578 --> 00:18:10.967
Okay.
 

00:18:10.967 --> 00:18:14.920
This is a first walk through
some essential ideas.

00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:18.651
I want to go back to the
distinction between language and

00:18:18.651 --> 00:18:22.048
speech and refer you to the
first passage which--

00:18:22.048 --> 00:18:25.740
now all of you have it--is on
your sheet,

00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:30.880
because like the Russian
formalists,

00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:36.971
Saussure is chiefly concerned
in outlining what he means by

00:18:36.971 --> 00:18:42.223
"semiology"
to establish the semiological

00:18:42.223 --> 00:18:44.848
project as a science.
 

00:18:44.848 --> 00:18:47.718
Like the Russian
formalists--and in a way like

00:18:47.718 --> 00:18:49.645
the New Critics--
talking about their

00:18:49.645 --> 00:18:50.930
"academic"
colleagues,

00:18:50.930 --> 00:18:56.154
Saussure is vexed by the
messiness and lack of system in

00:18:56.154 --> 00:18:58.720
the study of linguistics.
 

00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:02.259
This is what he says in this
first passage.

00:19:02.259 --> 00:19:07.112
He says: If we study speech
from several viewpoints

00:19:07.112 --> 00:19:10.789
simultaneously,
the object of linguistics

00:19:10.789 --> 00:19:15.576
appears to us as a confused mass
of heterogeneous and unrelated

00:19:15.576 --> 00:19:16.349
things.
 

00:19:16.349 --> 00:19:17.848
This is speech.
 

00:19:17.848 --> 00:19:18.931
[Gestures towards the
horizontal axis of the

00:19:18.931 --> 00:19:20.364
coordinates on the board.]
I'm a linguist and so what do I

00:19:20.364 --> 00:19:20.538
do?
 

00:19:20.538 --> 00:19:23.218
I study speech,
I study speeches,

00:19:23.218 --> 00:19:27.067
and if I do so,
and if I keep thinking about it

00:19:27.067 --> 00:19:31.336
in a variety of ways,
all sorts of frameworks jostle

00:19:31.336 --> 00:19:33.009
for attention.
 

00:19:33.009 --> 00:19:37.461
Saussure continues:
This procedure opens the door

00:19:37.461 --> 00:19:41.968
to several sciences,
psychology, anthropology,

00:19:41.968 --> 00:19:46.383
normative grammar,
philology and so on which are

00:19:46.383 --> 00:19:51.390
distinct from linguistics but
which claim speech in view of

00:19:51.390 --> 00:19:56.568
the faulty method of linguistics
as one of their objects.

00:19:56.568 --> 00:20:00.657
As I see it,
there is only one solution to

00:20:00.657 --> 00:20:03.950
all the foregoing difficulties.
 

00:20:03.950 --> 00:20:06.490
From the very outset [and this
is &gt;

00:20:06.490 --> 00:20:09.355
a really peculiar mixed
metaphor]

00:20:09.355 --> 00:20:14.190
we must put both feet on the
ground of language and use

00:20:14.190 --> 00:20:20.190
language as the norm of all the
other manifestations of speech.

00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:23.130
It's as if he's trying to hold
language down.

00:20:23.130 --> 00:20:23.568
&gt;
 

00:20:23.568 --> 00:20:24.608
"Stay there.
 

00:20:24.608 --> 00:20:25.710
Stay there."
 

00:20:25.710 --> 00:20:31.683
We put both feet on the ground
of language so that we have it

00:20:31.683 --> 00:20:36.892
intelligible to us as a system,
as something that can be

00:20:36.892 --> 00:20:40.268
understood,
precisely, differentially,

00:20:40.268 --> 00:20:45.136
that can be understood in the
variety of ways in which

00:20:45.136 --> 00:20:47.710
language organizes signs.
 

00:20:47.710 --> 00:20:51.980
It might be worth pausing over
the variety of ways in which we

00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:56.365
can think of signs in language,
all of which have to do with

00:20:56.365 --> 00:21:00.448
the way in which a given sign
might be chosen to go into a

00:21:00.448 --> 00:21:01.809
speech sentence.
 

00:21:01.809 --> 00:21:06.088
Take the word "ship."
 

00:21:06.088 --> 00:21:08.994
"Ship"
is very closely related in

00:21:08.994 --> 00:21:11.140
sound to certain other words.
 

00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:14.869
We won't specify them for fear
of a Freudian slip,

00:21:14.869 --> 00:21:16.848
but that is one cluster.
 

00:21:16.848 --> 00:21:22.051
That is one associational
matrix or network that one can

00:21:22.051 --> 00:21:27.348
think of in the arrangement of
that sign in language,

00:21:27.348 --> 00:21:30.384
but there are also synonyms for
"ship":

00:21:30.384 --> 00:21:33.170
"bark,
"boat,"

00:21:33.170 --> 00:21:38.759
"bateau,"
a great many other synonyms--

00:21:38.759 --> 00:21:40.250
"sailboat," whatever.
 

00:21:40.250 --> 00:21:44.207
They, too, exist in a cluster:
"steamship,"

00:21:44.207 --> 00:21:47.480
"ocean liner,"
in other words,

00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:49.930
words that don't sound at all
the same,

00:21:49.930 --> 00:21:53.990
but are contiguous in
synonymity.

00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:55.740
They cluster in that way.
 

00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:57.904
And then furthermore
"ship"

00:21:57.904 --> 00:22:00.430
is also the opposite of certain
things,

00:22:00.430 --> 00:22:03.898
so that it would also enter
into a relationship with

00:22:03.898 --> 00:22:06.211
"train,"
"car,"

00:22:06.211 --> 00:22:08.593
"truck,"
"mule,"

00:22:08.593 --> 00:22:11.108
modes of transportation,
right?

00:22:11.108 --> 00:22:14.856
In all of these ways,
"ship"

00:22:14.856 --> 00:22:20.933
is clustered associationally in
language in ways that make it

00:22:20.933 --> 00:22:26.243
available to be chosen,
available to be chosen as

00:22:26.243 --> 00:22:31.785
appropriate for a certain
semantic context that we try to

00:22:31.785 --> 00:22:34.259
develop when we speak.
 

00:22:34.259 --> 00:22:40.700
So that's the way a sign works
in language.

00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:45.259
This is the tip of the iceberg
for any given sign.

00:22:45.259 --> 00:22:50.872
By the way, in what I'm saying,
I oversimplify by supposing

00:22:50.872 --> 00:22:55.130
that the basic unit of language
is a word.

00:22:55.130 --> 00:22:58.868
The linguists know that that's
not at all necessarily the case.

00:22:58.868 --> 00:23:02.884
Linguists can work at different
levels of abstraction with

00:23:02.884 --> 00:23:03.660
language.
 

00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:06.058
Sometimes the basic unit is the
phrase,

00:23:06.058 --> 00:23:11.088
but some other times the basic
unit is the phoneme--

00:23:11.088 --> 00:23:13.880
that is to say,
the single sound unit--

00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:18.125
or if one's studying language
as a system of writing it might

00:23:18.125 --> 00:23:19.400
be the syllable.
 

00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:24.358
It could be the letter
understood either graphically or

00:23:24.358 --> 00:23:27.343
audibly,
and the variety of ways in

00:23:27.343 --> 00:23:31.896
which one can choose a basic
unit in the study of linguistics

00:23:31.896 --> 00:23:35.920
means that you need a special
word for that unit,

00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:39.740
which is characteristically
"the tagmeme."

00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:43.730
In other words,
whatever you are thinking of as

00:23:43.730 --> 00:23:47.101
your systematizing,
your understanding,

00:23:47.101 --> 00:23:50.176
of language,
and as the basic constituent

00:23:50.176 --> 00:23:51.897
unit--
"the word"

00:23:51.897 --> 00:23:54.263
being probably one of the less
popular choices,

00:23:54.263 --> 00:23:55.548
&gt;
 

00:23:55.548 --> 00:24:00.205
even though that's the one I've
just used--the blanket term for

00:24:00.205 --> 00:24:02.759
that is "the tagmeme."
 

00:24:02.759 --> 00:24:09.439
So you can understand the
associational nature of signs

00:24:09.439 --> 00:24:11.788
also as tagmemic.
 

00:24:11.788 --> 00:24:15.042
Then of course,
since there is a certain amount

00:24:15.042 --> 00:24:18.046
of semantic payoff,
let's say, even when you're

00:24:18.046 --> 00:24:21.815
talking about a phoneme--
especially because,

00:24:21.815 --> 00:24:26.066
as Saussure will say,
and as I'll get back to,

00:24:26.066 --> 00:24:29.048
in the misleading onomatopoetic
drift of language,

00:24:29.048 --> 00:24:31.930
perhaps a certain sound has
certain connotations,

00:24:31.930 --> 00:24:37.960
meaning the sound may cluster
in an associational network.

00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:42.924
But depending on the unit
chosen, the associational

00:24:42.924 --> 00:24:45.210
networks will differ.
 

00:24:45.210 --> 00:24:48.990
But at any level they will
still exist as a matrix.

00:24:48.990 --> 00:24:53.084
In other words,
how else could we have any

00:24:53.084 --> 00:24:56.779
sense of systematicity in
language?

00:24:56.779 --> 00:25:03.606
It is always probably the case
that when I speak I won't choose

00:25:03.606 --> 00:25:05.368
just any word.
 

00:25:05.368 --> 00:25:05.508
e.
 

00:25:05.508 --> 00:25:05.645
e.
 

00:25:05.645 --> 00:25:09.522
cummings actually boldly
experimented with this principle

00:25:09.522 --> 00:25:12.776
and he attracted the attention
of the linguists,

00:25:12.776 --> 00:25:16.028
particularly a linguist named
Dell Hymes.

00:25:16.028 --> 00:25:16.190
e.
 

00:25:16.190 --> 00:25:16.351
e.
 

00:25:16.351 --> 00:25:21.008
cummings wrote sentences like
"He danced his did"

00:25:21.008 --> 00:25:24.863
where "did"
is obviously not a word you

00:25:24.863 --> 00:25:29.519
would have supposed to be in any
way involved in a relevant

00:25:29.519 --> 00:25:31.930
associational cluster.
 

00:25:31.930 --> 00:25:36.165
"He danced his did":
that is in every sense a

00:25:36.165 --> 00:25:40.257
misfire,
as one school of thinking about

00:25:40.257 --> 00:25:45.138
language would call it,
and yet at the same time,

00:25:45.138 --> 00:25:50.700
cummings thumbs his nose at us
and deliberately uses that word

00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:56.353
almost as though he were issuing
a critique of semiotics but at

00:25:56.353 --> 00:26:01.094
the same time such that
semiotics would probably have

00:26:01.094 --> 00:26:06.200
available to it its ways and
means of refutation.

00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:10.356
A certain amount of ingenuity
is all that's required to notice

00:26:10.356 --> 00:26:13.491
that the "d"
sound or "duh"

00:26:13.491 --> 00:26:16.763
reiterates the "d,"
the "duh"

00:26:16.763 --> 00:26:20.785
sound in "danced,"
and that there are all sorts of

00:26:20.785 --> 00:26:24.260
combinatory pressures on his
consciousness to choose

00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:26.920
"did"
as opposed to some other

00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:29.509
seemingly irrelevant word.
 

00:26:29.509 --> 00:26:32.544
So in any case,
you can still,

00:26:32.544 --> 00:26:36.519
even with these egregious
examples,

00:26:36.519 --> 00:26:43.117
understand language even in its
infinite variety nevertheless as

00:26:43.117 --> 00:26:49.717
associational and as clustering
its available signs in ways that

00:26:49.717 --> 00:26:56.630
make them more readily to hand
for choice than they might be,

00:26:56.630 --> 00:26:59.308
all other things being equal.
 

00:26:59.308 --> 00:27:02.202
Well, in any case,
so language is a system of

00:27:02.202 --> 00:27:02.730
signs.
 

00:27:02.730 --> 00:27:07.799
The signs are both arbitrary
and differential.

00:27:07.799 --> 00:27:09.578
Now what does this mean?
 

00:27:09.578 --> 00:27:14.460
This is actually the second
thing, maybe,

00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:17.635
that we learn under the
influence of what we call

00:27:17.635 --> 00:27:21.474
"literary theory"
and the thinking that surrounds

00:27:21.474 --> 00:27:23.990
it about the nature of
perception.

00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:28.838
If the sign is both arbitrary
and differential--

00:27:28.838 --> 00:27:32.545
that is to say,
if there is no such thing as a

00:27:32.545 --> 00:27:37.365
natural sign,
something that is linked by

00:27:37.365 --> 00:27:40.886
nature,
by the nature of the thing and

00:27:40.886 --> 00:27:43.858
the word together with the
thing--

00:27:43.858 --> 00:27:49.828
if on one side of the border,
as Saussure puts it,

00:27:49.828 --> 00:27:51.932
we look at a cow and say,
"ochs,"

00:27:51.932 --> 00:27:55.288
and if on the other side of the
border we look at a cow and say,

00:27:55.288 --> 00:27:59.218
"boeuf,"
and if we cross a considerable

00:27:59.218 --> 00:28:03.963
body of water and we look at a
cow and say "cow,"

00:28:03.963 --> 00:28:08.547
plainly the relationship
between the thing and the

00:28:08.547 --> 00:28:11.940
sign--
the matrix signifier,

00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:15.500
signified--just doesn't exist.
 

00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:20.250
So signs are arbitrary-- and
they're also differential.

00:28:20.250 --> 00:28:24.365
I have to be able to
distinguish between all the

00:28:24.365 --> 00:28:28.220
signs I use in any communicative
sequence.

00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:29.640
How do I do it?
 

00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:33.400
By putting in signs which are
not other signs.

00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:39.334
The sign is not linked to the
natural world by any natural

00:28:39.334 --> 00:28:44.955
means, and the sign is not
linked to other signs by any

00:28:44.955 --> 00:28:46.828
natural means.
 

00:28:46.828 --> 00:28:53.053
I don't know a unit of
language-- which I use to

00:28:53.053 --> 00:28:57.819
communicate with you--
positively.

00:28:57.819 --> 00:29:02.088
I know it negatively.
 

00:29:02.088 --> 00:29:07.598
I know it only because it is
not everything else.

00:29:07.598 --> 00:29:10.839
Its direct relationship with
the thing that's most closely

00:29:10.839 --> 00:29:13.682
adjacent to it somehow either
through similarity or

00:29:13.682 --> 00:29:16.980
dissimilarity can never be a
relationship of identity.

00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:20.219
It's not that other thing,
but, generally speaking,

00:29:20.219 --> 00:29:24.430
the point about a sign is that
it's not any other thing.

00:29:24.430 --> 00:29:26.558
This is true even in homonyms.
 

00:29:26.558 --> 00:29:32.298
This is true even of seemingly
identical signs,

00:29:32.298 --> 00:29:39.102
because each has its use value
and is only intelligible as that

00:29:39.102 --> 00:29:44.259
which it exists to mean in a
certain context.

00:29:44.259 --> 00:29:52.076
So it is always the case that I
can only know what I know if

00:29:52.076 --> 00:29:58.170
it's a question of being
communicated with,

00:29:58.170 --> 00:30:01.019
having something rendered
intelligible for me,

00:30:01.019 --> 00:30:02.538
negatively.
 

00:30:02.538 --> 00:30:09.309
I can't know it because it just
is that sign.

00:30:09.309 --> 00:30:11.019
I don't know it positively.
 

00:30:11.019 --> 00:30:15.913
I'm about to give an example of
this which I hope will flesh out

00:30:15.913 --> 00:30:19.487
what I'm trying to get across;
in the meantime,

00:30:19.487 --> 00:30:23.155
let's look at a couple of
passages in Saussure that may

00:30:23.155 --> 00:30:24.380
make the point.
 

00:30:24.380 --> 00:30:30.413
Now not on the version of the
sheet that I passed out today

00:30:30.413 --> 00:30:32.910
&gt;
 

00:30:32.910 --> 00:30:36.058
but on the version that I sent
electronically last night,

00:30:36.058 --> 00:30:41.750
there is a fifth passage,
and that passage is actually a

00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:47.337
combination of formulations by
Saussure that are in two

00:30:47.337 --> 00:30:50.650
separate parts of your text.
 

00:30:50.650 --> 00:30:56.950
The first one is on page 844.
 

00:30:56.950 --> 00:31:00.078
Can this possibly be correct?
 

00:31:00.078 --> 00:31:02.363
I &gt;
 

00:31:02.363 --> 00:31:03.599
hope it can.
 

00:31:03.599 --> 00:31:05.690
No, it is not correct.
 

00:31:05.690 --> 00:31:11.193
It's page 845,
the lower left-hand column

00:31:11.193 --> 00:31:15.971
where Saussure says:
Language is a system of

00:31:15.971 --> 00:31:20.104
interdependent terms in which
the value of each term results

00:31:20.104 --> 00:31:24.307
solely from the simultaneous
presence of the others as in the

00:31:24.307 --> 00:31:28.452
diagram, [just below it]…
In other words,

00:31:28.452 --> 00:31:34.086
the value of a term--I say
something, I utter a sound--the

00:31:34.086 --> 00:31:39.325
value of that sound cannot be
determined except by its

00:31:39.325 --> 00:31:40.608
context.
 

00:31:40.608 --> 00:31:44.501
I can't know it except by the
way in which it differs from

00:31:44.501 --> 00:31:46.618
everything that surrounds it.
 

00:31:46.618 --> 00:31:51.277
He goes on to say--this is on
page 847 about halfway down the

00:31:51.277 --> 00:31:54.102
left-hand column:
… [A]

00:31:54.102 --> 00:32:00.357
segment of language can never
in the final analysis be based

00:32:00.357 --> 00:32:06.190
on anything except its
noncoincidence with the rest.

00:32:06.190 --> 00:32:09.982
Arbitrary and
differential are two

00:32:09.982 --> 00:32:11.920
correlative qualities.
 

00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:20.519
And then again another passage
on page 846,

00:32:20.519 --> 00:32:24.843
the right-hand column halfway
down: "…

00:32:24.843 --> 00:32:29.432
[C]oncepts are purely
differential and defined not by

00:32:29.432 --> 00:32:34.285
their positive content but
negatively by their relations

00:32:34.285 --> 00:32:38.078
with other terms of the
system."

00:32:38.078 --> 00:32:45.098
Now probably this is hard to
accept intuitively.

00:32:45.098 --> 00:32:53.431
We feel as we process the world
around us that we know things

00:32:53.431 --> 00:32:57.180
for and as what they are.
 

00:32:57.180 --> 00:33:00.210
I look at something and I know
what it is,

00:33:00.210 --> 00:33:05.098
forgetting that possibly I only
know what it is because of a

00:33:05.098 --> 00:33:10.070
context in which indeed it is
not those other things that are

00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:11.480
linked to it.
 

00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:14.140
Now I want to take an example.
 

00:33:14.140 --> 00:33:19.070
I could use any example but I'm
going to use something which

00:33:19.070 --> 00:33:23.920
plainly does move around among
various semiotic systems.

00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:28.310
It's a piece of language but it
also belongs to other sorts of

00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:31.480
semiotic systems as we'll
immediately see.

00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:35.980
I want to use the example of
the red light.

00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:40.040
Now in a stoplight,
which is probably just about

00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:43.930
the simplest semiotic system
that we have--

00:33:43.930 --> 00:33:46.920
it only has three,
one is tempted to say,

00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:49.946
variables plainly differing
from each other:

00:33:49.946 --> 00:33:52.660
red,
yellow and green--we have two

00:33:52.660 --> 00:33:55.568
ways of thinking about the red
light.

00:33:55.568 --> 00:34:01.396
If we think that our knowledge
is positive, we say

00:34:01.396 --> 00:34:06.630
"red"
in a red light means stop.

00:34:06.630 --> 00:34:10.190
It comes spontaneously to us to
say "red light"

00:34:10.190 --> 00:34:11.780
means "stop."
 

00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:18.630
Now if all we have to go on is
just this semiotic system,

00:34:18.630 --> 00:34:21.827
it's going to be kind of hard
to put up resistance to that

00:34:21.827 --> 00:34:24.688
sort of thinking because by the
same token we'll say

00:34:24.688 --> 00:34:27.045
"yellow"
means "pause,"

00:34:27.045 --> 00:34:29.570
"green"
means "go."

00:34:29.570 --> 00:34:35.230
These three lights with their
respective colors just do

00:34:35.230 --> 00:34:38.480
positively mean these things.
 

00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:42.496
Everybody knows it,
and I'm certainly not thinking

00:34:42.496 --> 00:34:47.333
when I approach an intersection
that when the red light goes

00:34:47.333 --> 00:34:49.135
on--
I'm not saying to myself,

00:34:49.135 --> 00:34:51.210
"Oh,
not yellow, not green."

00:34:51.210 --> 00:34:53.489
&gt;
 

00:34:53.489 --> 00:34:56.440
My mind just doesn't work that
way.

00:34:56.440 --> 00:35:00.224
All right, but still it's a red
light, right,

00:35:00.224 --> 00:35:05.474
and our hypothesis is that the
red light has positive value in

00:35:05.474 --> 00:35:09.260
the sense that it means a
certain thing.

00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:13.449
It means, we say,
"stop."

00:35:13.449 --> 00:35:20.518
Well, suppose the red light
appeared on or as the nose of a

00:35:20.518 --> 00:35:21.860
reindeer.
 

00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:27.081
In that case the red light
would be a beacon which means

00:35:27.081 --> 00:35:30.402
"forward,"
"go,"

00:35:30.402 --> 00:35:35.909
"follow me,"
"damn the torpedoes."

00:35:35.909 --> 00:35:36.449
Right? &gt;
 

00:35:36.449 --> 00:35:39.650
We've got to get these presents
distributed.

00:35:39.650 --> 00:35:41.659
No time to waste.
 

00:35:41.659 --> 00:35:45.657
And we race off--perhaps
risking an accident,

00:35:45.657 --> 00:35:46.567
who knows?
 

00:35:46.567 --> 00:35:48.840
&gt;
 

00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:53.101
--we race off under the
compulsion of the meaning of the

00:35:53.101 --> 00:35:55.735
red light, which is
"go,"

00:35:55.735 --> 00:35:56.510
right?
 

00:35:56.510 --> 00:35:58.789
Now by the way,
there's an anecdote,

00:35:58.789 --> 00:36:01.429
the truth of which I've never
been able to ascertain,

00:36:01.429 --> 00:36:05.030
that during the cultural
revolution in China,

00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:08.992
Madame Mao very much
disapproved of the fact that red

00:36:08.992 --> 00:36:12.650
lights meant "stop"
because red is,

00:36:12.650 --> 00:36:14.199
of course, the color of
progress.

00:36:14.199 --> 00:36:18.141
It ought to mean "to go
forward"

00:36:18.141 --> 00:36:22.250
with everything behind it,
but needless to say her

00:36:22.250 --> 00:36:25.293
thoughts on the subject were
never implemented because

00:36:25.293 --> 00:36:26.730
&gt;
 

00:36:26.730 --> 00:36:29.204
if one day red light means
"stop"

00:36:29.204 --> 00:36:31.974
and the next day red light
means "go,"

00:36:31.974 --> 00:36:33.980
there might be a few problems.
 

00:36:33.980 --> 00:36:39.197
This, by the way,
is a way of showing the fact

00:36:39.197 --> 00:36:45.226
that everything which appears in
a semiotic system is

00:36:45.226 --> 00:36:48.010
conventional,
right?

00:36:48.010 --> 00:36:52.219
I mean, there is an emptying
out of positive meaning in the

00:36:52.219 --> 00:36:55.262
very awareness that,
after all, the red light could

00:36:55.262 --> 00:36:57.440
mean "go"--
I'm about to go on and give

00:36:57.440 --> 00:36:58.090
more examples.
 

00:36:58.090 --> 00:36:59.960
It's conventional.
 

00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:05.159
Whatever the convention is
within a system of differences,

00:37:05.159 --> 00:37:08.989
that's what makes the sign
intelligible.

00:37:08.989 --> 00:37:09.500
All right.
 

00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:13.449
Just some other examples:
a red light over a street door.

00:37:13.449 --> 00:37:16.030
Well, that doesn't mean
"stop."

00:37:16.030 --> 00:37:19.338
That means "go in,"
"come in,"

00:37:19.338 --> 00:37:19.880
right?
 

00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:23.750
And of course it exists in a
semiotic relationship to a white

00:37:23.750 --> 00:37:27.750
light over a street door which
means "this is my house;

00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:30.996
if you wish you can ring the
bell but I'd just as soon you

00:37:30.996 --> 00:37:32.079
stayed out."
 

00:37:32.079 --> 00:37:35.737
This light is probably on to
keep burglars away and so:

00:37:35.737 --> 00:37:37.500
"stop,"
right?

00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:41.934
The red light is intelligible,
in other words,

00:37:41.934 --> 00:37:44.889
within that semiotic system.
 

00:37:44.889 --> 00:37:47.920
Now over an auditorium
door--and of course we've

00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:50.755
already been gazing at that
light back there,

00:37:50.755 --> 00:37:52.820
and it's not a good example.
 

00:37:52.820 --> 00:37:54.827
I wish it didn't say
"exit,"

00:37:54.827 --> 00:37:56.565
but it does say
"exit,"

00:37:56.565 --> 00:37:58.900
because that kind of weakens my
point,

00:37:58.900 --> 00:38:05.489
but over many auditorium doors
a red light just hangs there.

00:38:05.489 --> 00:38:08.170
Obviously, it doesn't mean
"come in"

00:38:08.170 --> 00:38:11.210
in the sense of the red light
over a street door.

00:38:11.210 --> 00:38:12.320
It means "go out,"
right?

00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:14.480
"This is the way out.
 

00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:18.304
This is the way you get out of
here," not "This is

00:38:18.304 --> 00:38:20.380
the way you get in here."
 

00:38:20.380 --> 00:38:23.865
There are a lot of ways in
which a red light means neither

00:38:23.865 --> 00:38:26.007
"stop"
nor "go,"

00:38:26.007 --> 00:38:29.615
but we are sort of confining
ourselves so far to the ways in

00:38:29.615 --> 00:38:33.224
which a red light has something
to do with locomotion or the

00:38:33.224 --> 00:38:34.510
lack thereof.
 

00:38:34.510 --> 00:38:39.947
In each new system,
you can see it takes on a new

00:38:39.947 --> 00:38:45.840
meaning always with respect to
whatever it is not.

00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:48.860
Well, we can continue.
 

00:38:48.860 --> 00:38:51.947
On a light-up valentine it
means "don't stop,

00:38:51.947 --> 00:38:52.639
go."
 

00:38:52.639 --> 00:38:56.286
It has the function,
in other words,

00:38:56.286 --> 00:39:01.913
of negating its own meaning in
another semiotic system,

00:39:01.913 --> 00:39:07.539
in this case the semiotic
system of the stoplight.

00:39:07.539 --> 00:39:13.349
On an ambulance or a police
car--admittedly,

00:39:13.349 --> 00:39:16.822
many of these lights are blue
these days but let's suppose

00:39:16.822 --> 00:39:18.726
that,
tradition prevailing,

00:39:18.726 --> 00:39:23.809
that they are still red--
they mean "get out of the

00:39:23.809 --> 00:39:28.030
way" or "stop,"
right?

00:39:28.030 --> 00:39:31.106
In other words,
they probably bear a distant

00:39:31.106 --> 00:39:34.400
relation to the semiotics of the
stoplight,

00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:38.659
and that's probably why red was
chosen for ambulances and police

00:39:38.659 --> 00:39:42.039
cars: because they put into your
head the notion of

00:39:42.039 --> 00:39:43.460
"stop."
 

00:39:43.460 --> 00:39:47.038
But it's a notion that's
complicated in this case by the

00:39:47.038 --> 00:39:50.681
equally imperative notion
"get out of the way,"

00:39:50.681 --> 00:39:54.001
which doesn't at all
necessarily entail stopping but

00:39:54.001 --> 00:39:57.320
rather accelerating in a
different direction.

00:39:57.320 --> 00:40:00.432
All of that somewhat
complicates the picture,

00:40:00.432 --> 00:40:04.041
but at the same time,
I think you can see that there

00:40:04.041 --> 00:40:07.650
is a connection between those
semiotic systems.

00:40:07.650 --> 00:40:10.230
It's a weak system in terms of
color.

00:40:10.230 --> 00:40:12.083
In the case of the ambulance
and police car,

00:40:12.083 --> 00:40:13.679
it's more a question of
brightness.

00:40:13.679 --> 00:40:17.851
As I say, red tends to be
chosen, but then if you get lab

00:40:17.851 --> 00:40:22.320
experiments showing that that
particular color of gas blue is

00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:26.864
somehow or another sort of more
invasive of your consciousness

00:40:26.864 --> 00:40:30.213
than red is,
then you move away from the

00:40:30.213 --> 00:40:33.579
arbitrariness of the choice of
red as a color.

00:40:33.579 --> 00:40:37.099
As I say, there's a certain
instability which could never

00:40:37.099 --> 00:40:40.932
apply in the semiotics of the
stoplight because there it's not

00:40:40.932 --> 00:40:44.389
so much a question of the
brightness of the color--

00:40:44.389 --> 00:40:46.250
although that has been
experimented with,

00:40:46.250 --> 00:40:50.438
as you know--but rather the
insistence that the color is

00:40:50.438 --> 00:40:51.809
just that color.
 

00:40:51.809 --> 00:40:55.550
Then finally--and here is
where, in a way,

00:40:55.550 --> 00:40:58.829
this is perhaps the most
interesting thing because it

00:40:58.829 --> 00:41:01.099
forces us to show the
complexity,

00:41:01.099 --> 00:41:04.284
to see the complexity,
of semiotic relationships:

00:41:04.284 --> 00:41:07.230
a red light,
just to return to the Christian

00:41:07.230 --> 00:41:10.460
holiday,
a red light on a Christmas tree.

00:41:10.460 --> 00:41:15.072
Now our first thought is,
Oh, aha, that has no

00:41:15.072 --> 00:41:16.579
meaning, right?
 

00:41:16.579 --> 00:41:20.438
It's no use talking about the
negative relationship between a

00:41:20.438 --> 00:41:23.268
red light and a green light and
a yellow,

00:41:23.268 --> 00:41:25.554
white, or blue one--whatever
the other colors on the

00:41:25.554 --> 00:41:28.793
Christmas tree are--
because they all have the same

00:41:28.793 --> 00:41:29.320
value.
 

00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:31.072
They're all bright,
they're all cheerful,

00:41:31.072 --> 00:41:32.824
they all say "Merry
Christmas,"

00:41:32.824 --> 00:41:33.699
etc., etc., etc.
 

00:41:33.699 --> 00:41:36.329
So what are you supposed to do
with that?

00:41:36.329 --> 00:41:39.936
Here you've got a red light
which doesn't seem to enter into

00:41:39.936 --> 00:41:42.809
this sense of the arbitrary and
differential.

00:41:42.809 --> 00:41:46.391
Well, that's because it's
actually not a gross constituent

00:41:46.391 --> 00:41:48.590
unit in a semiotic system,
right?

00:41:48.590 --> 00:41:53.302
"Bright lights"
is the gross constituent unit

00:41:53.302 --> 00:41:56.969
and the variety of those bright
lights,

00:41:56.969 --> 00:42:01.800
which is a matter of
aesthetics, is,

00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:05.570
ironically enough,
neutralized by the common

00:42:05.570 --> 00:42:09.869
signifier governing our
understanding of them,

00:42:09.869 --> 00:42:11.510
which is "bright
lights"--

00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:14.088
in this case,
particularly on a tree or

00:42:14.088 --> 00:42:18.090
festooning another ornament that
has some sort of comparable

00:42:18.090 --> 00:42:18.768
value.
 

00:42:18.768 --> 00:42:22.199
Once you get that,
once you get the value,

00:42:22.199 --> 00:42:24.677
"Christmas tree,"
as opposed to "red

00:42:24.677 --> 00:42:26.411
lights,"
"red lights"

00:42:26.411 --> 00:42:28.889
being perhaps a part of some
Christmas trees,

00:42:28.889 --> 00:42:31.969
then you see that you're back
in a semiotic system and a very

00:42:31.969 --> 00:42:35.139
obvious one,
because a Christmas tree is a

00:42:35.139 --> 00:42:37.920
not-menorah,
not-Kwanzaa candles.

00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:40.396
A Christmas tree,
in other words,

00:42:40.396 --> 00:42:44.884
is a sign that can only be
understood intelligibly in terms

00:42:44.884 --> 00:42:47.980
of a certain cultural
understanding.

00:42:47.980 --> 00:42:51.768
We think of course,
oh, we know what that is,

00:42:51.768 --> 00:42:55.956
and of course probably we do,
but we're misled in supposing

00:42:55.956 --> 00:43:00.289
that that's the key to the
understanding of it as a sign,

00:43:00.289 --> 00:43:05.045
because it's very possible to
imagine a circumstance in which

00:43:05.045 --> 00:43:07.980
someone wouldn't know what it
was,

00:43:07.980 --> 00:43:13.420
forcing us despite its
familiarity to ask ourselves,

00:43:13.420 --> 00:43:16.760
"Well, what is it and how
do we know what it is?"

00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:21.746
Then we realize once again that
we can only know what it is if

00:43:21.746 --> 00:43:24.784
we come to understand--
in this case,

00:43:24.784 --> 00:43:28.380
probably, it's best to say a
cultural system,

00:43:28.380 --> 00:43:35.820
understood as a semiosis,
within which it appears.

00:43:35.820 --> 00:43:39.777
So this last version of the red
light introduces interesting

00:43:39.777 --> 00:43:43.400
complications which I don't
think should confuse us.

00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:48.264
I think they should actually
show us a little bit more about

00:43:48.264 --> 00:43:52.471
how we can understand the
organization of the things

00:43:52.471 --> 00:43:56.429
around us and within us as
systems of signs.

00:43:56.429 --> 00:44:00.204
We know that we've already
learned from Heidegger and the

00:44:00.204 --> 00:44:04.449
hermeneutic tradition that we
know them as something,

00:44:04.449 --> 00:44:09.369
but it remained to show
how we know them.

00:44:09.369 --> 00:44:13.010
That is to say,
we don't know them positively.

00:44:13.010 --> 00:44:17.304
I mean, Heidegger raises the
interesting fact that we

00:44:17.304 --> 00:44:20.280
spontaneously recognize
something.

00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:24.365
But that's one of the things
which could be dangerous for

00:44:24.365 --> 00:44:28.891
semiotics because it would make
us think or assume that we know

00:44:28.891 --> 00:44:31.501
things positively--
without thinking,

00:44:31.501 --> 00:44:33.802
in other words,
"I know that that's an

00:44:33.802 --> 00:44:36.827
exit sign,
I don't know that it's a white

00:44:36.827 --> 00:44:42.061
thing with red marks on it,
but I know that it's an exit

00:44:42.061 --> 00:44:45.110
sign";
but I can't know that,

00:44:45.110 --> 00:44:49.777
the Saussurian argument goes,
without knowing that it is not

00:44:49.777 --> 00:44:52.309
all the things that it's not.
 

00:44:52.309 --> 00:44:56.360
If it were all the things that
it's not,

00:44:56.360 --> 00:45:00.574
or if it were identical to all
the things that somehow or

00:45:00.574 --> 00:45:03.889
another it's not,
then I would be in a very

00:45:03.889 --> 00:45:07.871
difficult situation because I
wouldn't have any means of

00:45:07.871 --> 00:45:09.900
knowing it in particular.
 

00:45:09.900 --> 00:45:15.239
The very fact that I need to
know it in particular is what

00:45:15.239 --> 00:45:18.800
makes me need to know it
negatively.

00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:22.773
In other words,
we now know two things about

00:45:22.773 --> 00:45:28.041
how we perceive things from the
standpoint of this subject

00:45:28.041 --> 00:45:31.077
matter,
and it's very useful to put

00:45:31.077 --> 00:45:34.862
them together,
the fact that we always know

00:45:34.862 --> 00:45:38.396
things first--
but at the same time the fact

00:45:38.396 --> 00:45:42.485
that it's misleading to think
that our knowing them first

00:45:42.485 --> 00:45:45.260
means that we know them
positively;

00:45:45.260 --> 00:45:51.518
we know them first but we also
know them negatively,

00:45:51.518 --> 00:45:55.199
in negation of other things.
 

00:45:55.199 --> 00:45:55.574
Okay.
 

00:45:55.574 --> 00:45:59.768
So let me just return once
again to the way in which sign

00:45:59.768 --> 00:46:04.413
systems are intelligible because
lots of- there are going to be

00:46:04.413 --> 00:46:09.206
lots of moments in a course like
this in which what we seem to be

00:46:09.206 --> 00:46:11.846
saying is that,
"Oh, we can't know

00:46:11.846 --> 00:46:13.639
anything,"
or "We don't know what we

00:46:13.639 --> 00:46:15.949
know," or "How do we
know what we know?"

00:46:15.949 --> 00:46:20.347
Maybe we're skirting rhetorical
questions of that kind,

00:46:20.347 --> 00:46:22.219
but we're really not.
 

00:46:22.219 --> 00:46:24.820
What we're talking about today
is how we do know things.

00:46:24.820 --> 00:46:25.880
Right?
 

00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:30.175
If we take semiotics seriously,
it gives us a rather

00:46:30.175 --> 00:46:34.556
sophisticated means of
understanding precisely how we

00:46:34.556 --> 00:46:38.085
know things,
but it insists that we know

00:46:38.085 --> 00:46:41.423
things because of their
conventional nature:

00:46:41.423 --> 00:46:45.346
that is to say,
because they are conventions

00:46:45.346 --> 00:46:49.889
existing within a system of
conventions insofar as we

00:46:49.889 --> 00:46:53.670
recognize them--
things, signs--as existing,

00:46:53.670 --> 00:46:56.969
because if we're thinking about
a thing,

00:46:56.969 --> 00:47:01.400
we're thinking about that thing
as a sign in semiotics.

00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:04.291
If we don't know that,
if we don't recognize its

00:47:04.291 --> 00:47:08.110
existence in a system--
if we can't think what system

00:47:08.110 --> 00:47:11.094
it belongs to,
perhaps to put it in a better

00:47:11.094 --> 00:47:15.018
way--that's tantamount to saying
we really don't know what it is.

00:47:15.018 --> 00:47:18.079
I think the more we think about
it,

00:47:18.079 --> 00:47:21.565
the more we realize that we
only know what it is if we know

00:47:21.565 --> 00:47:24.907
the system that it belongs to,
which is to say,

00:47:24.907 --> 00:47:28.896
all of the things related to it
which it is not.

00:47:28.896 --> 00:47:29.659
Right?
 

00:47:29.659 --> 00:47:30.061
Okay.
 

00:47:30.061 --> 00:47:33.753
So the intelligibility of sign
systems is their

00:47:33.753 --> 00:47:35.280
conventionality.
 

00:47:35.280 --> 00:47:39.494
That's why it's impossible for
anybody to come along and say,

00:47:39.494 --> 00:47:43.710
"Oh, I don't like the fact
that the red light is red.

00:47:43.710 --> 00:47:45.610
It's symbolically the wrong
move.

00:47:45.610 --> 00:47:48.710
Let's make the red light the
symbol of 'go.'"

00:47:48.710 --> 00:47:52.001
And now with the ecological
movement it would be very

00:47:52.001 --> 00:47:54.914
difficult to make the green
light the symbol of

00:47:54.914 --> 00:47:57.762
"stop,"
and in any case all sorts of

00:47:57.762 --> 00:47:59.407
complications would arise.
 

00:47:59.407 --> 00:48:01.369
&gt;
 

00:48:01.369 --> 00:48:01.800
Right?
 

00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:05.976
But in the meantime you see
that we can't mess with

00:48:05.976 --> 00:48:11.320
conventional systems by imposing
the individuality of our will on

00:48:11.320 --> 00:48:14.829
them and expecting anything to
change.

00:48:14.829 --> 00:48:23.159
A seeming exception is the fact
that sometimes individuals can,

00:48:23.159 --> 00:48:27.179
through the exertion of their
influence and prestige,

00:48:27.179 --> 00:48:30.039
actually change the way we
speak about things.

00:48:30.039 --> 00:48:31.329
This is a seeming exception.
 

00:48:31.329 --> 00:48:34.820
Think about the way Jesse
Jackson almost single-handedly

00:48:34.820 --> 00:48:38.565
convinced us that we should use
the expression "African

00:48:38.565 --> 00:48:41.739
American"
even though it's a cumbersome,

00:48:41.739 --> 00:48:45.371
polysyllabic expression which
you would think somehow or

00:48:45.371 --> 00:48:49.335
another would be intuitively
rejected because it's so hard to

00:48:49.335 --> 00:48:51.599
say,
but it worked.

00:48:51.599 --> 00:48:55.489
He convinced us all to say
"African American."

00:48:55.489 --> 00:48:57.860
You say to yourself,
"Ah ha!

00:48:57.860 --> 00:49:01.650
There is an example of somebody
taking language by the scruff of

00:49:01.650 --> 00:49:04.360
the neck and changing it as an
individual,

00:49:04.360 --> 00:49:08.974
exerting an individual will
over against the conventional

00:49:08.974 --> 00:49:11.199
nature of language."
 

00:49:11.199 --> 00:49:15.548
The semiotician's answer to
this is it never could have

00:49:15.548 --> 00:49:20.139
happened simply as an act of
agency, as an act of will.

00:49:20.139 --> 00:49:22.510
It had to be acquiesced in.
 

00:49:22.510 --> 00:49:28.686
You needed the community that
makes use of linguistic

00:49:28.686 --> 00:49:34.150
conventions to acquiesce in a
change of use.

00:49:34.150 --> 00:49:38.373
Remember, language exists
synchronically:

00:49:38.373 --> 00:49:44.500
it only exists in a moment,
in a moment of simultaneity.

00:49:44.500 --> 00:49:48.474
We study language
diachronically--that is to say,

00:49:48.474 --> 00:49:50.380
we study its history.
 

00:49:50.380 --> 00:49:53.239
We study its unfolding in time.
 

00:49:53.239 --> 00:49:57.739
Now this unfolding is not,
according to the semioticians--

00:49:57.739 --> 00:49:59.500
and here's another link with
the Russian formalists--

00:49:59.500 --> 00:50:03.257
is not a question of studying
the way in which language is

00:50:03.257 --> 00:50:05.927
changed from without--
that is to say,

00:50:05.927 --> 00:50:08.731
studying the way in which,
for example,

00:50:08.731 --> 00:50:12.460
an individual can rise up and
insist on changing one of the

00:50:12.460 --> 00:50:16.376
signs;
but rather a sequence of

00:50:16.376 --> 00:50:20.130
synchronic cross-sections.
 

00:50:20.130 --> 00:50:22.925
From moment to moment,
language changes,

00:50:22.925 --> 00:50:27.300
but if we're to understand it
as language we have to honor its

00:50:27.300 --> 00:50:28.518
simultaneity.
 

00:50:28.518 --> 00:50:31.916
In that case,
we understand it as a sequence

00:50:31.916 --> 00:50:35.945
of cross-sections rather than
something that somehow

00:50:35.945 --> 00:50:38.869
organically changes through
time.

00:50:38.869 --> 00:50:42.360
At each cross-section,
people are either willing to

00:50:42.360 --> 00:50:46.059
use a certain sign in a certain
way or they're not.

00:50:46.059 --> 00:50:48.518
That's the crucial thing:
if they're not willing,

00:50:48.518 --> 00:50:53.148
the use of the sign doesn't
work, which confirms the idea

00:50:53.148 --> 00:50:57.860
that nothing can be changed
simply by individual agency in

00:50:57.860 --> 00:50:59.349
and of itself.
 

00:50:59.349 --> 00:51:00.210
All right.
 

00:51:00.210 --> 00:51:02.610
I need to come back to
synchrony and diachrony.

00:51:02.610 --> 00:51:07.130
I'll do so next time and
probably in subsequent lectures

00:51:07.130 --> 00:51:11.570
because we're going to keep
using these coordinates.

00:51:11.570 --> 00:51:14.380
We're going to keep using the
things that exist in space,

00:51:14.380 --> 00:51:17.626
virtual or not,
and the things that unfold in

00:51:17.626 --> 00:51:22.275
time in their relationship with
each other as we continue to try

00:51:22.275 --> 00:51:26.333
to understand these basic
principles which shape so much

00:51:26.333 --> 00:51:28.989
of subsequent literary theory.
 

00:51:28.989 --> 00:51:30.400
Thank you.

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.795
Okay.
 

00:00:02.795 --> 00:00:06.799
Well, today we return to the
main political and

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:10.890
ecclesiastical narrative leading
up to the--

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:15.816
do you mind?--leading up to the
outbreak of the civil wars in

00:00:15.816 --> 00:00:18.280
the mid-seventeenth century.
 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:23.620
We left our discussion of the
Elizabethan church two weeks ago

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:28.874
with the situation of relative
calm at the end of Elizabeth's

00:00:28.874 --> 00:00:29.750
reign.
 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.704
If you'll remember,
the domestic threat posed by

00:00:33.704 --> 00:00:37.070
the Catholic minority was
diminishing.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.981
Puritan attempts to change the
structure of the church through

00:00:40.981 --> 00:00:43.610
action in Parliament had been
defeated.

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.423
And to a large extent that
relative stability can be said

00:00:47.423 --> 00:00:50.897
to have persisted in to the
first two decades of the

00:00:50.897 --> 00:00:55.140
seventeenth century,
that is in to the reign of

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.710
James I who came to the throne
in 1603 and died in 1625.

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.022
And indeed the continuities
between the end of Elizabeth's

00:01:05.022 --> 00:01:09.183
reign and the reign of James
have led some historians to

00:01:09.183 --> 00:01:13.495
speak of what they call a
"Jacobethan consensus"

00:01:13.495 --> 00:01:16.750
in the church during this
generation;

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.188
Jacobean plus Elizabethan,
Jacobethan.

00:01:21.188 --> 00:01:24.537
The characteristics of that
consensus can be perhaps

00:01:24.537 --> 00:01:28.343
illustrated with reference to an
event at the very start of

00:01:28.343 --> 00:01:29.459
James' reign.
 

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:34.194
In 1603, as he made his way
south from Edinburgh to be

00:01:34.194 --> 00:01:38.447
crowned in London,
he was presented with what's

00:01:38.447 --> 00:01:41.930
become known as the Millenary
Petition,

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.041
getting that name from the fact
that it was allegedly subscribed

00:01:46.041 --> 00:01:49.370
by a thousand ministers of the
Church of England.

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:53.337
And it revealed a body of
opinion within the church

00:01:53.337 --> 00:01:57.620
petitioning James in the hope
that he would countenance

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:01.430
further reform:
further reform in doctrine,

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:06.439
in the ceremonies of the
church, and in the quality of

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:07.670
the clergy.
 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.857
That led James to call the
Hampton Court Conference in

00:02:11.857 --> 00:02:14.058
1604,
which was a conference of

00:02:14.058 --> 00:02:17.388
leading churchmen in which all
strands of opinion were

00:02:17.388 --> 00:02:18.330
represented.
 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.318
In the course of the
conference, James was very

00:02:21.318 --> 00:02:25.413
forthright in insisting that he
would not countenance any change

00:02:25.413 --> 00:02:29.120
in the episcopal government of
the Church of England.

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.608
Twice in the course of the
debates he intervened famously

00:02:32.608 --> 00:02:35.660
with the phrase "No bishop,
no King."

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.008
He'd had quite enough of the
semi-independent Presbyterian

00:02:40.008 --> 00:02:41.610
Church of Scotland.
 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.025
So discussion of church
government in that sense was not

00:02:46.025 --> 00:02:47.310
on the agenda.
 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.360
Still it wasn't a confrontation
between James and the Puritan

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.520
wing of the Church of England.
 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.917
He was very comfortable with
the godly issues that were

00:02:57.917 --> 00:02:58.650
raised.
 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.197
He was very keen on steps to
improve the learning and quality

00:03:03.197 --> 00:03:04.408
of the clergy.
 

00:03:04.408 --> 00:03:07.639
He agreed that there should be
a new English translation of the

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:10.435
Bible,
the one eventually published in

00:03:10.435 --> 00:03:14.710
1611 known in Britain as the
Authorized Version or here as

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:16.508
the King James Bible.
 

00:03:16.508 --> 00:03:20.313
And everyone was very impressed
with the King's doctrinal

00:03:20.313 --> 00:03:21.128
knowledge.
 

00:03:21.128 --> 00:03:24.556
He had had a very thorough
theological education in

00:03:24.556 --> 00:03:25.310
Scotland.
 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:30.746
There was no question in other
words that James was a godly

00:03:30.746 --> 00:03:31.590
prince.
 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.341
He was England's Solomon,
as they flatteringly termed

00:03:36.341 --> 00:03:36.889
him.
 

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:40.986
So the Hampton Court Conference
revealed the existence of

00:03:40.986 --> 00:03:44.337
continuing differences,
differences of opinion about

00:03:44.337 --> 00:03:46.770
aspects of the Church of
England's structure,

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:52.502
but there was a great deal of
common ground and the conference

00:03:52.502 --> 00:03:55.038
broke up pretty amicably.
 

00:03:55.038 --> 00:03:58.389
Let's look at that common
ground a little closely -- a

00:03:58.389 --> 00:03:59.780
little more closely.
 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.713
First of all,
there was by the early

00:04:02.713 --> 00:04:07.658
seventeenth century an essential
consensus over doctrine.

00:04:07.658 --> 00:04:11.675
Since the late 1580s,
most theologians in the

00:04:11.675 --> 00:04:16.420
universities had been
interpreting the ambiguities of

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:22.170
the Elizabethan settlement in an
essentially Calvinist way.

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:26.579
They tended to accept the
doctrine of predestination,

00:04:26.579 --> 00:04:30.141
the view that God had
predestined those who would be

00:04:30.141 --> 00:04:34.473
amongst the elect and those who
would be reprobate or damned at

00:04:34.473 --> 00:04:36.009
the Last Judgment.
 

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:41.315
They also had a widely shared
model of the ideal godly

00:04:41.315 --> 00:04:46.220
Protestant devotional life based
on Biblicism,

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:50.293
attendance at sermons,
the practice of household

00:04:50.293 --> 00:04:52.882
devotions,
and a strict 'godly

00:04:52.882 --> 00:04:55.500
conversation',
as they called it;

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:59.574
that is, strict personal
behavior, strict moral behavior

00:04:59.574 --> 00:05:00.759
in daily life.
 

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:05.454
All of this was supported by a
growing vernacular religious

00:05:05.454 --> 00:05:09.502
literature which tended to
support this approach to

00:05:09.502 --> 00:05:11.040
religious life.
 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:16.197
They also shared a common view
of the need to entrench

00:05:16.197 --> 00:05:22.136
Protestant doctrine and reformed
behavior in the population at

00:05:22.136 --> 00:05:23.110
large.
 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:28.172
Only a minority might be saved
according to Calvinist doctrine,

00:05:28.172 --> 00:05:31.519
but no one knew for sure who
they were.

00:05:31.519 --> 00:05:35.396
Therefore, the church must
address the whole population,

00:05:35.396 --> 00:05:38.779
it must serve the whole
population, and it should

00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:40.259
minister to them.
 

00:05:40.259 --> 00:05:43.718
It's interesting for example
that when the 1611 translation

00:05:43.718 --> 00:05:46.579
was being prepared by a
committee of divines,

00:05:46.579 --> 00:05:49.040
when they'd settled on a
translation of a passage,

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:52.360
they used to read it aloud to
see if it would be effective

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:55.040
when read aloud to illiterate
congregations.

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:59.581
They were very conscious of the
need to be able to communicate

00:05:59.581 --> 00:06:01.220
in that kind of way.
 

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:05.358
Well, to that end a great deal
of stress was placed on the

00:06:05.358 --> 00:06:09.132
provision of a godly pastorate
of teaching, preaching

00:06:09.132 --> 00:06:10.149
ministers.
 

00:06:10.149 --> 00:06:14.740
And, as we saw when looking at
education, a great deal was in

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:17.189
fact achieved in that respect.
 

00:06:17.189 --> 00:06:23.096
By the early 1600s,
there was also an unmistakable

00:06:23.096 --> 00:06:25.750
Protestant identity.
 

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:30.348
Despite internal differences of
opinion, most people were

00:06:30.348 --> 00:06:34.538
conscious of their common
membership of a Protestant

00:06:34.538 --> 00:06:37.660
confessional family within
Europe.

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:41.815
Their feelings of religious
hostility were directed outwards

00:06:41.815 --> 00:06:45.690
towards the threat of what they
usually described not as

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:48.649
Catholicism but as
"Popery."

00:06:48.649 --> 00:06:54.569
Popery was the supposed
antithesis of reformed religion,

00:06:54.569 --> 00:06:58.649
characterized as a church which
was based not on the pure,

00:06:58.649 --> 00:07:03.449
unvarnished word of scripture
but on human errors,

00:07:03.449 --> 00:07:07.839
corrupted by false doctrine and
superstitious practices,

00:07:07.839 --> 00:07:12.810
and increasingly seen as alien.
 

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:13.949
Okay.
 

00:07:13.949 --> 00:07:17.019
Well, there's a good deal to be
said for this notion of a

00:07:17.019 --> 00:07:20.033
Jacobethan consensus in the
generation which spanned the

00:07:20.033 --> 00:07:22.829
last years of Elizabeth and the
reign of James.

00:07:22.829 --> 00:07:28.180
But, if the church was indeed
at relative peace it was

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:34.540
enjoying a period of stability
that was in many ways fragile.

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:38.113
One mustn't overdo the element
of consensus,

00:07:38.113 --> 00:07:42.517
and by the 1620s there was
increasing evidence of that

00:07:42.517 --> 00:07:46.839
consensus being subject to
destabilizing forces.

00:07:46.839 --> 00:07:49.959
And there were two of them in
particular to emphasize.

00:07:49.959 --> 00:07:53.425
First of all,
there was the process of what

00:07:53.425 --> 00:07:58.129
one can call Puritan reformation
down in the parishes,

00:07:58.129 --> 00:08:04.569
and secondly there was the
Arminian reaction at the center,

00:08:04.569 --> 00:08:07.420
and I'll look at each of these
in turn.

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:10.810
Well starting with the Puritans.
 

00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:14.028
The Puritans,
as we've already seen,

00:08:14.028 --> 00:08:16.889
were those that contemporaries
thought of as,

00:08:16.889 --> 00:08:20.204
in the phrase of the time,
the "hotter sort of

00:08:20.204 --> 00:08:21.528
Protestants."
 

00:08:21.528 --> 00:08:25.750
Those who were most committed
to furthering the reformation.

00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:29.410
And by furthering the
reformation they meant not

00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:33.850
simply conformity to a
Protestant religious settlement;

00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:38.570
they also had the ambition of
galvanizing the religious life

00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:40.330
of the whole nation.
 

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:43.708
As one of them put it,
they sought "a reduction

00:08:43.708 --> 00:08:47.751
of all things disordered,"
be it in religion or in social

00:08:47.751 --> 00:08:50.863
morality,
a reduction of it to the model

00:08:50.863 --> 00:08:54.429
of God's requirements as
revealed in scripture,

00:08:54.429 --> 00:08:56.918
as they saw it.
 

00:08:56.918 --> 00:09:01.774
These were of course people of
fervent faith and astringent

00:09:01.774 --> 00:09:03.950
personal religious life.
 

00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:07.751
It's best revealed in the way
they monitored their own lives

00:09:07.751 --> 00:09:10.908
in the spiritual diaries that
they often kept,

00:09:10.908 --> 00:09:15.288
straining by examination of
their own behavior to achieve

00:09:15.288 --> 00:09:19.667
the sanctification of personal
life which would give them

00:09:19.667 --> 00:09:22.168
assurance of their election.
 

00:09:22.168 --> 00:09:24.615
Assurance that they were
amongst the elect,

00:09:24.615 --> 00:09:27.861
those who would be saved;
an assurance which often simply

00:09:27.861 --> 00:09:30.830
didn't come to many of them,
but they kept struggling.

00:09:30.830 --> 00:09:35.794
And that struggle bred a kind
of spiritual anxiety which

00:09:35.794 --> 00:09:40.220
perhaps underlay their often
vigorous activism.

00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:44.788
They sought reassurance often
in action.

00:09:44.788 --> 00:09:48.865
These were not just formal
members of the church living

00:09:48.865 --> 00:09:53.167
their lives within a general
framework of Christian belief

00:09:53.167 --> 00:09:54.450
and practice.
 

00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:59.419
They were seriously religious
people and their religion shaped

00:09:59.419 --> 00:10:01.048
their whole lives.
 

00:10:01.048 --> 00:10:06.691
The trouble was that it not
only shaped their lives but not

00:10:06.691 --> 00:10:11.750
infrequently impacted also on
the lives of others.

00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:15.839
Amongst the clergy those of
puritanical inclination were

00:10:15.839 --> 00:10:20.375
amongst the most conscientious
and the most active in the task

00:10:20.375 --> 00:10:22.678
of evangelizing the people.
 

00:10:22.678 --> 00:10:25.851
Whatever their private
preferences as to forms of

00:10:25.851 --> 00:10:28.881
church government,
most of them had long ago

00:10:28.881 --> 00:10:32.495
abandoned any serious attempt to
transform the church by

00:10:32.495 --> 00:10:33.808
political action.
 

00:10:33.808 --> 00:10:36.980
They'd withdrawn from that
after the 1580s.

00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:41.519
Instead they conformed more or
less to the requirements of the

00:10:41.519 --> 00:10:45.539
church for the sake of the
larger task of spreading the

00:10:45.539 --> 00:10:48.610
word;
evangelizing.

00:10:48.610 --> 00:10:54.620
Protestantism seemed to them to
demand popular enlightenment.

00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:58.898
It demanded a dispelling of
what they viewed as the darkness

00:10:58.898 --> 00:11:01.798
of popish ignorance and
superstition,

00:11:01.798 --> 00:11:06.918
and godly ministers entered
upon that task with very high

00:11:06.918 --> 00:11:08.288
expectations.
 

00:11:08.288 --> 00:11:13.120
When one reads their works they
often speak initially of the

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:17.950
mass of the population as
"hungry sheep unfed."

00:11:17.950 --> 00:11:21.871
They describe them as
"fields of corn ripe for

00:11:21.871 --> 00:11:25.480
the harvest"
or they're "babes crying

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:28.226
for the milk of good
doctrine,"

00:11:28.226 --> 00:11:32.700
and what could stand against
the word if it was brought to

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:33.720
them?
 

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:37.629
Unfortunately for that
optimistic position,

00:11:37.629 --> 00:11:41.519
they often found that their own
parishioners tended to

00:11:41.519 --> 00:11:45.408
disappoint their high hopes of
evangelical success.

00:11:45.408 --> 00:11:49.115
A parish ministry day by day,
week by week,

00:11:49.115 --> 00:11:52.292
year by year,
could often be a deeply

00:11:52.292 --> 00:11:54.940
disillusioning experience.
 

00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:58.624
Richard Greenham,
who was one of the most famous

00:11:58.624 --> 00:12:02.691
of the early Puritan preachers--
he was the minister of Dry

00:12:02.691 --> 00:12:06.065
Drayton near Cambridge,
a man much sought after for

00:12:06.065 --> 00:12:09.774
advice by other Puritans--
Richard Greenham finally

00:12:09.774 --> 00:12:13.636
resigned his living at Dry
Drayton after twenty years of

00:12:13.636 --> 00:12:16.181
effort,
effort which had him not only

00:12:16.181 --> 00:12:19.724
preaching on Sundays and on
weekdays but even going out and

00:12:19.724 --> 00:12:23.451
standing by the fields as his
parishioners went out to work on

00:12:23.451 --> 00:12:27.054
their farms to talk to them
about matters of religion and so

00:12:27.054 --> 00:12:27.850
forth.
 

00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:30.490
After twenty years of this
effort,

00:12:30.490 --> 00:12:35.644
he gave up because of what he
called "the untractableness

00:12:35.644 --> 00:12:39.279
and unteachableness of that
people."

00:12:39.279 --> 00:12:42.688
And there gradually grew up in
the early decades of the

00:12:42.688 --> 00:12:46.351
seventeenth century alongside
the literature of sermons and

00:12:46.351 --> 00:12:49.955
devotional works,
what one can perhaps describe

00:12:49.955 --> 00:12:53.240
as a literature of godly
disillusionment,

00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:58.105
in which people reflected upon
their lack of success in the

00:12:58.105 --> 00:13:00.120
evangelizing movement.
 

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:04.321
And such literature very often
contained a very somber

00:13:04.321 --> 00:13:08.918
assessment of the state of
popular religion in England,

00:13:08.918 --> 00:13:12.394
and I'll give you some
quotations from the kind of

00:13:12.394 --> 00:13:14.379
things they tended to say.
 

00:13:14.379 --> 00:13:18.269
They were deeply concerned
about the fact that the people

00:13:18.269 --> 00:13:22.087
were ignorant of doctrine,
uninstructed in what they saw

00:13:22.087 --> 00:13:24.450
as saving doctrinal knowledge.
 

00:13:24.450 --> 00:13:27.928
To give some examples from
these works: "the poor

00:13:27.928 --> 00:13:32.000
people do not understand so much
as the Lord's Prayer."

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.875
"If any question be put to
them as concerning religion,

00:13:35.875 --> 00:13:38.240
they grow as mute as
fishes."

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:41.583
"Men can talk
understandingly about ways of

00:13:41.583 --> 00:13:44.245
the world,
but they can scarcely speak a

00:13:44.245 --> 00:13:47.120
word of sense about matters of
salvation."

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:51.937
"Our sermons are but a
breath from us and a sound to

00:13:51.937 --> 00:13:57.100
them"--because they didn't
understand the half of it.

00:13:57.100 --> 00:14:00.370
These are all quotations from
works of this kind.

00:14:00.370 --> 00:14:03.932
They said that the religion of
the people remained one of

00:14:03.932 --> 00:14:06.668
"formality and blind
devotion."

00:14:06.668 --> 00:14:09.750
That's a common phrase,
"formality and blind

00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:12.446
devotion,"
reliance upon a ritualistic

00:14:12.446 --> 00:14:16.418
repetition of one's prayers;
turning up at church services

00:14:16.418 --> 00:14:20.455
more as a gathering of neighbors
than as a congregation of the

00:14:20.455 --> 00:14:23.364
faithful;
more concerned with who they

00:14:23.364 --> 00:14:26.460
saw at church than with what
they heard;

00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:29.942
and confident that this was
enough, that this was a good

00:14:29.942 --> 00:14:32.855
life, which in the eyes of the
godly ministers,

00:14:32.855 --> 00:14:34.440
of course, it wasn't.
 

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:36.440
The people were 'superstitious'.
 

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:40.580
They still adhered to practices
which they were too ignorant to

00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:44.519
recognize as being hangovers
from the dark age of popery.

00:14:44.519 --> 00:14:48.120
They practiced magic,
they visited cunning folk,

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:50.678
and they were
"profane"

00:14:50.678 --> 00:14:55.558
people who did not appreciate
the need to sanctify their lives

00:14:55.558 --> 00:14:59.960
according to the word of God and
who maintained forms of

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:03.320
customary behavior offensive to
God.

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:06.509
They swore;
they drank to excess;

00:15:06.509 --> 00:15:09.979
they indulged in what one
minister described as

00:15:09.979 --> 00:15:13.750
"light, lewd,
and lascivious dancing;"

00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:18.389
they broke the Sabbath either
by working in their farms and

00:15:18.389 --> 00:15:21.830
workshops or by their leisure
activities;

00:15:21.830 --> 00:15:25.038
hanging out in the ale house as
soon as they got out of church.

00:15:25.038 --> 00:15:28.645
As one preacher put it,
"every parish hath a

00:15:28.645 --> 00:15:32.928
profane and ignorant multitude
who are born with a pope in

00:15:32.928 --> 00:15:36.308
their belly,"
by which he meant they were

00:15:36.308 --> 00:15:39.538
directed by their fleshly
appetites--

00:15:39.538 --> 00:15:43.519
"born with a pope in their
belly are not yet redeemed from

00:15:43.519 --> 00:15:46.804
that gross supervision--
superstition--and vain

00:15:46.804 --> 00:15:51.211
conversation which they have
received by tradition from their

00:15:51.211 --> 00:15:52.460
fathers."
 

00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:57.123
In short, they were prisoners
of popular custom rather than

00:15:57.123 --> 00:16:00.340
followers of the precept of
scripture.

00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:05.686
But there was a remedy for all
of this and these condemnatory

00:16:05.686 --> 00:16:11.299
jeremiads tended to be followed
rapidly by calls for the pursuit

00:16:11.299 --> 00:16:16.288
of reformation of these
disorders by a dual policy,

00:16:16.288 --> 00:16:19.750
a policy of "word and
sword."

00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:23.216
Ministers and secular
magistrates, whether they be

00:16:23.216 --> 00:16:26.330
parish officers or justices of
the peace,

00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:30.620
the leaders of towns or
parliamentary members,

00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:33.418
they should all act together.
 

00:16:33.418 --> 00:16:36.480
The word of the minister would
"reform the inside"

00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:39.317
of the people;
the sword of the magistrate

00:16:39.317 --> 00:16:42.220
would "conform the
outside";

00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:45.360
word and sword.
 

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:49.298
Well, such recommendations
didn't fall on deaf ears,

00:16:49.298 --> 00:16:52.932
and where godly ministers and
like-minded local officers and

00:16:52.932 --> 00:16:55.210
magistrates supported one
another,

00:16:55.210 --> 00:16:58.706
as they sometimes did,
this kind of answer to the

00:16:58.706 --> 00:17:01.620
cultural failings of the
reformation,

00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:05.536
its failings to adequately
communicate with the people down

00:17:05.536 --> 00:17:08.101
in the parishes,
led to what's been

00:17:08.101 --> 00:17:12.160
characterized as widespread
cultural conflict in the early

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:15.700
seventeenth century,
right down at the level of the

00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:16.308
locality.
 

00:17:16.308 --> 00:17:21.266
Many forms of customary popular
culture in the parishes were

00:17:21.266 --> 00:17:22.190
attacked.
 

00:17:22.190 --> 00:17:25.556
Feasts and festivities,
Sunday dancings and so forth

00:17:25.556 --> 00:17:29.186
were often put down partly
because they were held on the

00:17:29.186 --> 00:17:32.522
Sabbath day,
partly because they tempted

00:17:32.522 --> 00:17:37.817
people to profane behavior,
notably drunkenness and the

00:17:37.817 --> 00:17:39.980
incitement of lust.
 

00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:43.770
One study by Ronald Hutton in
The Rise and Fall of Merry

00:17:43.770 --> 00:17:47.626
England shows how gradually
these traditional feasts and

00:17:47.626 --> 00:17:51.483
festivals disappeared all over
southeastern England and were

00:17:51.483 --> 00:17:55.013
gradually retreating into the
north and west where they

00:17:55.013 --> 00:17:56.910
continued to survive.
 

00:17:56.910 --> 00:18:02.308
There was also widespread
attack, at local level,

00:18:02.308 --> 00:18:05.616
upon such things as the
numerous alehouses which the

00:18:05.616 --> 00:18:08.220
people frequented--
many of them were

00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:12.161
suppressed--and at such common
everyday sins as profane

00:18:12.161 --> 00:18:14.825
swearing,
for example swearing "By

00:18:14.825 --> 00:18:17.250
God" in the course of
conversation.

00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:22.000
The arrest book for the town of
Dorchester, which was dominated

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.144
by a Puritan group from the
1610s onwards,

00:18:25.144 --> 00:18:28.210
is quite interesting on market
days.

00:18:28.210 --> 00:18:32.207
It reveals numerous cases of
people arrested on market day

00:18:32.207 --> 00:18:36.345
for swearing in the marketplace,
or for getting drunk in the

00:18:36.345 --> 00:18:38.450
taverns around the market.
 

00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:41.160
That was a field day for
reformation.

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:45.211
As a result,
some communities became well

00:18:45.211 --> 00:18:49.058
known as models of godly
discipline.

00:18:49.058 --> 00:18:53.083
Often they were small towns,
places like Banbury in

00:18:53.083 --> 00:18:55.913
Oxfordshire,
which was known for what was

00:18:55.913 --> 00:18:57.412
described,
approvingly,

00:18:57.412 --> 00:19:00.556
as its "precise course of
government,"

00:19:00.556 --> 00:19:03.632
its imposition locally of
stricter standards of

00:19:03.632 --> 00:19:04.769
reformation.
 

00:19:04.769 --> 00:19:07.838
Or Dorchester in Dorset,
which I've already mentioned,

00:19:07.838 --> 00:19:11.013
under its patriarch,
John White, or indeed

00:19:11.013 --> 00:19:13.880
Stratford-on-Avon in
Warwickshire,

00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:18.028
where the local Puritan group
triumphed after a sharp tussle

00:19:18.028 --> 00:19:21.682
with their opponents:
the opponents in fact including

00:19:21.682 --> 00:19:25.057
a number of friends and
associates of the retired

00:19:25.057 --> 00:19:27.660
playwright William Shakespeare.
 

00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:31.568
Other communities remained
uneasily divided.

00:19:31.568 --> 00:19:35.711
They were prone to occasional
eruptions of conflict brought on

00:19:35.711 --> 00:19:39.515
by reforming initiatives:
local attempts to tighten up on

00:19:39.515 --> 00:19:43.464
standards of church attendance,
to put down ale houses or

00:19:43.464 --> 00:19:46.218
whatever was the case,
and there might be no lasting

00:19:46.218 --> 00:19:48.702
victory,
just a continuing tussle

00:19:48.702 --> 00:19:50.650
between the two sides.
 

00:19:50.650 --> 00:19:56.029
Still others remained
relatively untouched.

00:19:56.029 --> 00:20:01.349
A number of historians have
looked at all of this and tried

00:20:01.349 --> 00:20:05.019
to interpret its broader
implications.

00:20:05.019 --> 00:20:06.406
David Underdown,
for example,

00:20:06.406 --> 00:20:09.380
in the study of what was going
on in the west of England,

00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:13.051
has speculated about the
possible association between

00:20:13.051 --> 00:20:16.513
different local social and
economic structures and

00:20:16.513 --> 00:20:20.327
different degrees of proneness
or susceptibility to the

00:20:20.327 --> 00:20:23.858
outbreak of this kind of
religious conflict.

00:20:23.858 --> 00:20:27.633
He asks why some places seem to
have been able to exclude such

00:20:27.633 --> 00:20:31.528
conflict, whereas others were
deeply divided and riven by it.

00:20:31.528 --> 00:20:35.406
Why did the Puritan word take
root so much better in some

00:20:35.406 --> 00:20:37.068
places than in others?
 

00:20:37.068 --> 00:20:41.000
In the east of England,
especially the counties of East

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.579
Anglia,
where the Puritans very much

00:20:43.579 --> 00:20:47.215
called the tune by the second
quarter of the seventeenth

00:20:47.215 --> 00:20:49.146
century,
a number of scholars,

00:20:49.146 --> 00:20:51.469
William Hunt,
myself and others,

00:20:51.469 --> 00:20:56.250
have suggested that religious
impulses for reformation and

00:20:56.250 --> 00:21:00.864
greater discipline were
superimposed in these areas upon

00:21:00.864 --> 00:21:05.169
other forms of social tension;
that the Puritan ministers

00:21:05.169 --> 00:21:08.170
tended to win their converts
principally amongst what were

00:21:08.170 --> 00:21:10.538
known as the better sort of
parishioners,

00:21:10.538 --> 00:21:13.519
the more prosperous leaders of
the parish,

00:21:13.519 --> 00:21:17.646
the more literate people,
and that local struggles were

00:21:17.646 --> 00:21:22.385
aimed primarily at disciplining
the poor and the young of their

00:21:22.385 --> 00:21:23.608
communities.
 

00:21:23.608 --> 00:21:29.096
In other words that religious
anxieties and social anxieties

00:21:29.096 --> 00:21:34.118
reinforced one another,
one mutating into the other.

00:21:34.118 --> 00:21:38.190
Still others have insisted that
the whole thing was purely a

00:21:38.190 --> 00:21:42.333
religious matter,
that if there was a corrugation

00:21:42.333 --> 00:21:47.237
or a segmenting of local
populations according to one or

00:21:47.237 --> 00:21:52.125
another religious persuasion,
it was simply a matter of the

00:21:52.125 --> 00:21:55.616
introduction of particular
religious messages and the

00:21:55.616 --> 00:21:59.443
intensity with which those
beliefs were held in particular

00:21:59.443 --> 00:22:00.250
places.
 

00:22:00.250 --> 00:22:04.733
So there are different takes on
the unevenness of Puritan

00:22:04.733 --> 00:22:09.459
success, but what one can say in
general is that it was very

00:22:09.459 --> 00:22:10.338
uneven.
 

00:22:10.338 --> 00:22:13.459
Nevertheless,
all agree that such conflict

00:22:13.459 --> 00:22:17.828
existed in many parishes,
in many towns and it was all

00:22:17.828 --> 00:22:22.390
part and parcel of the local
history of the reformation in

00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:24.470
its most advanced form.
 

00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:29.240
Obviously, it depended first
and foremost upon the

00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:34.982
communication of the demand for
a more stringent reformation

00:22:34.982 --> 00:22:37.318
into the localities.
 

00:22:37.318 --> 00:22:42.441
Those places which were least
troubled by all this were those

00:22:42.441 --> 00:22:45.769
where these demands were never
heard.

00:22:45.769 --> 00:22:49.535
There was never a minister of
Puritan persuasion,

00:22:49.535 --> 00:22:54.086
or a town council of Puritan
persuasion, there to instigate

00:22:54.086 --> 00:22:56.440
such reformatory programs.
 

00:22:56.440 --> 00:23:00.381
For whatever reason they found
no local constituency of

00:23:00.381 --> 00:23:01.328
supporters.
 

00:23:01.328 --> 00:23:05.608
But the outcome,
where conflict did break out,

00:23:05.608 --> 00:23:10.542
tended to depend crucially on
whether the 'godly' or those who

00:23:10.542 --> 00:23:15.720
resisted them had most control
in local decision-making power.

00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:18.660
Town councils,
parish vestries and so forth

00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:22.788
and who controlled them were
often crucial to the success or

00:23:22.788 --> 00:23:25.798
failure of these reformatory
movements.

00:23:25.798 --> 00:23:30.113
It's all part of the way that
the long-term outcome of the

00:23:30.113 --> 00:23:34.425
reformation and the long-term
development of the nature of

00:23:34.425 --> 00:23:38.663
English Protestantism was being
settled and fought out in

00:23:38.663 --> 00:23:42.117
dispersed,
diffuse actions taking place

00:23:42.117 --> 00:23:45.711
all over the kingdom,
though rather more common in

00:23:45.711 --> 00:23:48.430
some parts of the kingdom than
in others.

00:23:48.430 --> 00:23:50.588
And gradually,
by the 1620s,

00:23:50.588 --> 00:23:54.750
it gave rather different
complexions to the Church of

00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:57.630
England in different localities.
 

00:23:57.630 --> 00:24:01.380
East Anglia was predominantly
Puritan.

00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:04.943
One survey of the ministers of
the three counties of East

00:24:04.943 --> 00:24:08.891
Anglia for example reveals that
by the 1630s two thirds of them

00:24:08.891 --> 00:24:12.009
could be described as Puritan in
inclination.

00:24:12.009 --> 00:24:14.700
This was a great area of
Puritan strength.

00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:17.528
There were other counties also
which shared that.

00:24:17.528 --> 00:24:20.907
The north and the west tended
to see much less Puritan

00:24:20.907 --> 00:24:21.608
activity.
 

00:24:21.608 --> 00:24:26.288
Other counties were much
divided.

00:24:26.288 --> 00:24:31.541
And in the course of it all the
term "Puritan"

00:24:31.541 --> 00:24:34.788
acquired a new layer of
meaning.

00:24:34.788 --> 00:24:38.829
Within the Jacobean church
Puritans could not easily be

00:24:38.829 --> 00:24:43.090
distinguished by their theology,
they couldn't easily be

00:24:43.090 --> 00:24:46.160
distinguished by their ethical
teachings--

00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:48.038
both of them were essentially
mainstream.

00:24:48.038 --> 00:24:54.772
But what did distinguish them
was their intensity and their

00:24:54.772 --> 00:24:56.048
activism.
 

00:24:56.048 --> 00:25:01.660
They were defined in a sense by
a godly activism which,

00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:05.828
when it was unleashed in a
particular local context,

00:25:05.828 --> 00:25:10.868
tended to maximize stress over
religious issues.

00:25:10.868 --> 00:25:15.630
That's where they got defined,
in such contexts.

00:25:15.630 --> 00:25:18.589
No one chose to call himself a
Puritan;

00:25:18.589 --> 00:25:20.108
it was a term of abuse.
 

00:25:20.108 --> 00:25:24.974
They were labeled as Puritans
by their opponents in such

00:25:24.974 --> 00:25:27.009
conflictual contexts.
 

00:25:27.009 --> 00:25:29.596
As Patrick Collinson,
one of the greatest historians

00:25:29.596 --> 00:25:32.565
of Puritanism,
has put it, Puritanism was

00:25:32.565 --> 00:25:36.210
"not a thing definable in
itself."

00:25:36.210 --> 00:25:41.890
It was "one half of a
stressful relationship."

00:25:41.890 --> 00:25:44.410
"One half of a stressful
relationship"--

00:25:44.410 --> 00:25:50.708
the relationship that arose in
some parishes through the impact

00:25:50.708 --> 00:25:56.500
on local society of the fervent
pursuit of reformation.

00:25:56.500 --> 00:26:00.348
Okay.
 

00:26:00.348 --> 00:26:05.086
Let's turn now to the other
destabilizing group,

00:26:05.086 --> 00:26:06.700
the Arminians.
 

00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:11.346
And before we go any further
with this let me stress

00:26:11.346 --> 00:26:14.808
Arminians, A-r-m-i-n,
not Armenians.

00:26:14.808 --> 00:26:18.773
Every year when we have the
examination sinister groups of

00:26:18.773 --> 00:26:22.670
Armenians turn up destabilizing
the Church of England.

00:26:22.670 --> 00:26:24.068
&gt;
 

00:26:24.068 --> 00:26:28.038
There was indeed an Armenian
community in northwestern Europe

00:26:28.038 --> 00:26:29.028
at this time.
 

00:26:29.028 --> 00:26:33.093
They were vitally important in
the trade networks which linked

00:26:33.093 --> 00:26:36.690
northwestern Europe to the east
and they were there.

00:26:36.690 --> 00:26:40.625
But they had nothing whatever
to do with the troubles of the

00:26:40.625 --> 00:26:41.960
Church of England.
 

00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:45.210
So "Arminians."
 

00:26:45.210 --> 00:26:49.314
The Arminians were another
minority who occasioned a good

00:26:49.314 --> 00:26:52.759
deal of conflict in the early
Stuart church,

00:26:52.759 --> 00:26:57.147
but this time they can be
defined more easily in terms of

00:26:57.147 --> 00:26:58.009
theology.
 

00:26:58.009 --> 00:27:02.090
Theologically,
they comprised a minority of

00:27:02.090 --> 00:27:06.269
English churchmen who rejected
Calvinism.

00:27:06.269 --> 00:27:09.818
They rejected the Calvinist
doctrine of predestination.

00:27:09.818 --> 00:27:13.691
Rather than believing that only
the elect were predestined to

00:27:13.691 --> 00:27:15.876
salvation,
they believed,

00:27:15.876 --> 00:27:20.402
more traditionally,
in the universality of God's

00:27:20.402 --> 00:27:26.660
grace and in the free will of
all mankind to choose salvation.

00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:30.028
So they're theologically
distinct.

00:27:30.028 --> 00:27:33.529
They had their antecedents in
the late sixteenth century

00:27:33.529 --> 00:27:37.154
amongst those theologians who
did not interpret the Thirty

00:27:37.154 --> 00:27:41.098
Nine Articles in a Calvinist
manner but remained closely--

00:27:41.098 --> 00:27:45.953
closer--to more traditional
teaching and indeed to Lutheran

00:27:45.953 --> 00:27:48.130
teaching in their views.
 

00:27:48.130 --> 00:27:51.955
In the early seventeenth
century, they came to be labeled

00:27:51.955 --> 00:27:55.305
'Arminians' after a Dutch
theologian who took this

00:27:55.305 --> 00:27:57.558
position, Arminius of Leiden.
 

00:27:57.558 --> 00:28:00.713
His criticism of Calvin was
deemed so important at the time

00:28:00.713 --> 00:28:03.867
that it was a subject of a major
conference of the reformed

00:28:03.867 --> 00:28:06.513
churches,
the Synod of Dort,

00:28:06.513 --> 00:28:11.749
which met in 1618 at which
Arminius' teachings were

00:28:11.749 --> 00:28:13.108
denounced.
 

00:28:13.108 --> 00:28:17.849
But Arminianism also existed
amongst a minority of English

00:28:17.849 --> 00:28:23.088
churchmen and it had certain
distinctive features in England.

00:28:23.088 --> 00:28:25.505
In the Netherlands,
Arminius was operating within

00:28:25.505 --> 00:28:27.920
the context of the Dutch
Reformed Church with its

00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:29.380
Congregational structure.
 

00:28:29.380 --> 00:28:34.666
The English Arminians existed
in the context of a church with

00:28:34.666 --> 00:28:39.601
a traditional Episcopal system
of church government and a

00:28:39.601 --> 00:28:44.358
highly traditional form of
prayer book ceremonial.

00:28:44.358 --> 00:28:47.991
The English Arminians tended to
link their belief in the

00:28:47.991 --> 00:28:51.624
doctrine of free grace to other
beliefs connected to the

00:28:51.624 --> 00:28:54.200
structure of the Church of
England.

00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:58.827
They believed in episcopacy,
not simply as a form of church

00:28:58.827 --> 00:29:03.455
government amongst many others
but as a divinely sanctioned

00:29:03.455 --> 00:29:05.848
form of church government.
 

00:29:05.848 --> 00:29:09.413
They were very keen on the
structure of hierarchical

00:29:09.413 --> 00:29:11.230
authority in the church.
 

00:29:11.230 --> 00:29:16.760
They were also very keen on the
sacraments as a means of grace,

00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:19.259
as a way of coming to God.
 

00:29:19.259 --> 00:29:23.038
For example,
they restored the significance

00:29:23.038 --> 00:29:26.401
of the altar,
rather than of the communion

00:29:26.401 --> 00:29:28.942
table,
and the significance of the

00:29:28.942 --> 00:29:33.374
communion service as something
more than just a commemoration

00:29:33.374 --> 00:29:35.220
of Christ's sacrifice.
 

00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:38.922
They tended to play down
preaching, preaching so dear to

00:29:38.922 --> 00:29:42.018
the heart of Puritans as the
essential means of

00:29:42.018 --> 00:29:43.230
communication.
 

00:29:43.230 --> 00:29:47.756
Arminians tended to play down
preaching and to place more

00:29:47.756 --> 00:29:51.554
emphasis, as an element in
worship, upon ritual,

00:29:51.554 --> 00:29:55.029
upon the performance of the
sacraments.

00:29:55.029 --> 00:29:59.670
They spoke of the beauty of
holiness.

00:29:59.670 --> 00:30:02.054
They thought that
participation,

00:30:02.054 --> 00:30:05.821
reverent participation,
in services and rituals of

00:30:05.821 --> 00:30:09.130
great beauty,
had a spiritual function.

00:30:09.130 --> 00:30:12.623
They also had a very high
notion of the dignity of the

00:30:12.623 --> 00:30:13.480
priesthood.
 

00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:17.935
They were very clericalist in
that sense, and their most

00:30:17.935 --> 00:30:21.420
prominent spokesmen were leading
clerics;

00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:25.531
people like Lancelot Andrewes,
the Bishop of Winchester,

00:30:25.531 --> 00:30:28.672
Bishop Richard Neile,
the Bishop of Durham,

00:30:28.672 --> 00:30:30.990
and above all William Laud.
 

00:30:30.990 --> 00:30:33.150
All of these names are on your
handout.

00:30:33.150 --> 00:30:35.705
William Laud,
who started as an Oxford

00:30:35.705 --> 00:30:37.710
academic, was Master of St.
 

00:30:37.710 --> 00:30:40.779
John's College,
Oxford, and later moved on to

00:30:40.779 --> 00:30:45.176
be Dean of Gloucester Cathedral
and then to other higher offices

00:30:45.176 --> 00:30:47.618
in the church as I'll describe.
 

00:30:47.618 --> 00:30:53.352
The Arminians were a minority
even amongst the bishops of the

00:30:53.352 --> 00:30:55.548
church under James I.
 

00:30:55.548 --> 00:30:59.671
That became clear at the very
end of James' reign in 1624 when

00:30:59.671 --> 00:31:02.846
Richard Montagu,
an Arminian who was the Dean of

00:31:02.846 --> 00:31:03.318
St.
 

00:31:03.318 --> 00:31:07.075
Paul's Cathedral in London,
published his non-Calvinist

00:31:07.075 --> 00:31:11.317
interpretation of the Church of
England's Thirty Nine Articles

00:31:11.317 --> 00:31:12.430
of Religion.
 

00:31:12.430 --> 00:31:16.670
This publication by Montagu was
widely attacked.

00:31:16.670 --> 00:31:21.123
Indeed, he was reproved and his
interpretation was rejected by

00:31:21.123 --> 00:31:25.356
the Archbishop of Canterbury
himself, who was doctrinally a

00:31:25.356 --> 00:31:26.380
Calvinist.
 

00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:29.740
To most members of the church
at this point in time,

00:31:29.740 --> 00:31:34.565
the beliefs and the practices
of worship which were favored by

00:31:34.565 --> 00:31:37.650
the Arminians looked very
suspicious.

00:31:37.650 --> 00:31:40.440
They looked like backsliding.
 

00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:43.420
They looked like backsliding
towards Rome,

00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:47.338
and indeed although the
Arminians were undoubtedly

00:31:47.338 --> 00:31:51.137
Protestants,
they were very much closer to

00:31:51.137 --> 00:31:55.529
traditional Catholic teaching in
many respects,

00:31:55.529 --> 00:31:59.198
including the fact that they
regarded the Catholic church

00:31:59.198 --> 00:32:03.015
itself as being a true church,
albeit a corrupted one,

00:32:03.015 --> 00:32:07.190
rather than seeing it as in
fact the work of Antichrist,

00:32:07.190 --> 00:32:11.092
which was the conventional
extreme Protestant

00:32:11.092 --> 00:32:12.598
interpretation.
 

00:32:12.598 --> 00:32:18.279
Well, all of this might have
just remained a matter for

00:32:18.279 --> 00:32:24.276
theological debate at the
academic level if it hadn't been

00:32:24.276 --> 00:32:26.170
for two facts.
 

00:32:26.170 --> 00:32:29.857
First of all,
some of the Arminians were of a

00:32:29.857 --> 00:32:34.470
singularly combative and
authoritarian frame of mind.

00:32:34.470 --> 00:32:38.684
They were equal in their
determination to impose their

00:32:38.684 --> 00:32:43.695
will to any of the most fervent
Puritans, whom on the whole they

00:32:43.695 --> 00:32:44.730
detested.
 

00:32:44.730 --> 00:32:50.972
And secondly in the 1620s the
Arminians succeeded in winning

00:32:50.972 --> 00:32:55.523
over to their side the young
Prince Charles,

00:32:55.523 --> 00:32:58.170
the future Charles I.
 

00:32:58.170 --> 00:33:04.059
He was persuaded by people of
Arminian convictions that their

00:33:04.059 --> 00:33:08.970
brand of religion was more
suited to a monarchy.

00:33:08.970 --> 00:33:11.509
He liked it.
 

00:33:11.509 --> 00:33:18.333
Well, in 1625 Charles came to
the throne on the death of James

00:33:18.333 --> 00:33:21.236
I and,
as head of the church,

00:33:21.236 --> 00:33:25.803
he rapidly seized the
opportunity to advance Arminians

00:33:25.803 --> 00:33:29.509
in the church and to exclude
Calvinists.

00:33:29.509 --> 00:33:33.519
And it all happened remarkably
quickly.

00:33:33.519 --> 00:33:38.163
In 1626, the Duke of
Buckingham, Charles' favorite

00:33:38.163 --> 00:33:41.689
and mentor,
was appointed chancellor of the

00:33:41.689 --> 00:33:46.160
University of Cambridge where he
used his power as chancellor to

00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:49.068
forbid the teaching of
predestination.

00:33:49.068 --> 00:33:54.609
In 1627, William Laud and
Richard Neile were appointed to

00:33:54.609 --> 00:33:59.259
the royal privy council,
a very unusual move.

00:33:59.259 --> 00:34:03.213
It had been rare for even the
highest clerics to be admitted

00:34:03.213 --> 00:34:06.230
to the center of power in that
kind of way.

00:34:06.230 --> 00:34:07.960
But Charles did it.
 

00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:12.601
In 1628, Charles as supreme
head of the church insisted that

00:34:12.601 --> 00:34:17.007
an Arminian interpretation of
the Thirty Nine Articles of

00:34:17.007 --> 00:34:19.623
Religion,
the same interpretation which

00:34:19.623 --> 00:34:22.860
had been denounced when put
forward only four years earlier,

00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:27.039
was the only valid
interpretation.

00:34:27.039 --> 00:34:32.324
In the same year William Laud
was promoted to be Bishop of

00:34:32.324 --> 00:34:33.159
London.
 

00:34:33.159 --> 00:34:37.818
That was a crucial office,
not only presiding over the

00:34:37.818 --> 00:34:41.173
metropolis,
of course, but it was also an

00:34:41.173 --> 00:34:45.717
office which gave the bishop the
power to control the licensing

00:34:45.717 --> 00:34:50.039
of all books which were printed
and published in London.

00:34:50.039 --> 00:34:54.657
And Laud used that power of
control of the press to further

00:34:54.657 --> 00:34:59.753
his own views and to silence his
critics by refusing licenses for

00:34:59.753 --> 00:35:02.539
the publication of their works.
 

00:35:02.539 --> 00:35:07.217
In 1630, Laud was appointed
Chancellor of the University of

00:35:07.217 --> 00:35:12.219
Oxford with predictable results
as regards theological teaching

00:35:12.219 --> 00:35:13.349
at Oxford.
 

00:35:13.349 --> 00:35:17.333
In 1632, Richard Neile was
appointed Archbishop of York,

00:35:17.333 --> 00:35:20.809
governing the northern province
of the church.

00:35:20.809 --> 00:35:25.275
And finally in 1633 on the
death of his predecessor,

00:35:25.275 --> 00:35:28.952
George Abbot,
Laud was appointed Archbishop

00:35:28.952 --> 00:35:30.530
of Canterbury.
 

00:35:30.530 --> 00:35:36.157
So, in only eight years the
Arminians, with Charles' help,

00:35:36.157 --> 00:35:39.809
had captured the Church of
England;

00:35:39.809 --> 00:35:45.610
they held all the most
important positions.

00:35:45.610 --> 00:35:50.221
If Puritan activism in the
parishes had done a good deal to

00:35:50.221 --> 00:35:54.833
disturb the localities and to
create tensions over religion

00:35:54.833 --> 00:35:59.250
down in the provinces,
the Arminian victory in the

00:35:59.250 --> 00:36:03.875
church utterly shattered the
Jacobethan consensus within

00:36:03.875 --> 00:36:08.835
which Puritan evangelists in the
localities had been able to

00:36:08.835 --> 00:36:09.929
shelter.
 

00:36:09.929 --> 00:36:16.210
William Laud simply detested
Puritans.

00:36:16.210 --> 00:36:20.614
More than that,
he detested Calvinists and he

00:36:20.614 --> 00:36:24.320
defined all Calvinists as
Puritans.

00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:29.623
He drove them together out of
their shared hostility to what

00:36:29.623 --> 00:36:34.119
to them seemed to be innovations
in the church,

00:36:34.119 --> 00:36:39.090
alien innovations which were
suspiciously popish looking,

00:36:39.090 --> 00:36:43.541
a program of change in the
church which filled them with

00:36:43.541 --> 00:36:44.190
dread.
 

00:36:44.190 --> 00:36:47.438
All of this served,
from both sides,

00:36:47.438 --> 00:36:52.731
to politicize religion at the
national level in a way that

00:36:52.731 --> 00:36:56.909
really hadn't been known since
the 1580s.

00:36:56.909 --> 00:37:03.420
In 1626, Laud had preached a
sermon to Parliament,

00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:06.735
when it met,
alleging the existence of a

00:37:06.735 --> 00:37:11.072
Puritan and Presbyterian
conspiracy to undermine the

00:37:11.072 --> 00:37:16.253
Church of England from within,
and he denounced all those who

00:37:16.253 --> 00:37:20.440
didn't share his own views as
being Puritan subversives.

00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:23.659
In 1628, many members of
Parliament,

00:37:23.659 --> 00:37:27.344
when it met again,
reciprocated by condemning Laud

00:37:27.344 --> 00:37:31.856
and the Arminian innovations
which had been introduced in the

00:37:31.856 --> 00:37:34.768
meantime,
and they began indulging in

00:37:34.768 --> 00:37:36.420
their own name calling.
 

00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:39.757
One member of the House of
Commons, Francis Rous,

00:37:39.757 --> 00:37:44.210
declared "an Arminian is
but the spawn of a papist."

00:37:44.210 --> 00:37:47.130
In the House of Lords,
the Earl of Bedford,

00:37:47.130 --> 00:37:50.780
a Puritan aristocrat,
described Arminians as,

00:37:50.780 --> 00:37:53.663
to quote him,
"the little thief put in

00:37:53.663 --> 00:37:57.440
at the window of the church to
unlock the door."

00:37:57.440 --> 00:38:00.474
"The little thief put in
at the window of the church to

00:38:00.474 --> 00:38:01.710
unlock the door."
 

00:38:01.710 --> 00:38:05.518
To unlock the door to whom?
 

00:38:05.518 --> 00:38:10.385
To popery of course,
and its European champions

00:38:10.385 --> 00:38:16.309
whose successes in the 1620s in
the Thirty Years War,

00:38:16.309 --> 00:38:19.760
which had been raging in Europe
since 1618,

00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:24.994
just exacerbated the sense of
English Protestants of being

00:38:24.994 --> 00:38:29.585
embattled against powerful
enemies and exposed to a

00:38:29.585 --> 00:38:33.809
resurgent Counter Reformation
Catholicism.

00:38:33.809 --> 00:38:37.344
The war which was going on in
Germany was in fact immensely

00:38:37.344 --> 00:38:40.427
complex in its origins,
but to outside observers it

00:38:40.427 --> 00:38:43.090
looked like an essentially
religious struggle,

00:38:43.090 --> 00:38:46.847
and in the 1620s the armies of
Spain fighting against the

00:38:46.847 --> 00:38:50.469
Netherlands and the armies of
the Austrian emperor,

00:38:50.469 --> 00:38:54.197
a Catholic of course,
were winning and seemed to be

00:38:54.197 --> 00:38:57.179
driving back Protestantism in
Germany.

00:38:57.179 --> 00:39:02.041
All this fueled the paranoia of
those who observed it all from

00:39:02.041 --> 00:39:02.840
outside.
 

00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:07.697
Well, the rise of feeling of
that kind should have warned

00:39:07.697 --> 00:39:08.739
Charles I.
 

00:39:08.739 --> 00:39:13.445
It would almost certainly have
warned his shrewd and canny

00:39:13.445 --> 00:39:15.179
father, King James.
 

00:39:15.179 --> 00:39:18.961
But Charles appears to have
been indifferent to the

00:39:18.961 --> 00:39:20.929
polarization of opinion.
 

00:39:20.929 --> 00:39:24.692
He lacked his father's
political good sense and he

00:39:24.692 --> 00:39:27.610
allowed William Laud to press
ahead.

00:39:27.610 --> 00:39:33.489
Between 1630 and 1632,
when he was Bishop of London,

00:39:33.489 --> 00:39:37.110
Laud was extremely active in
East Anglia,

00:39:37.110 --> 00:39:39.659
part of which fell under the
bishopric of London,

00:39:39.659 --> 00:39:43.469
in rooting out Puritans,
in calling them before him to

00:39:43.469 --> 00:39:47.646
be examined on their beliefs,
in suspending them,

00:39:47.646 --> 00:39:51.699
indeed in ejecting them from
the church.

00:39:51.699 --> 00:39:55.420
Many of them joined the
migration to New England,

00:39:55.420 --> 00:40:00.380
sometimes taking key members of
their congregations with them.

00:40:00.380 --> 00:40:02.400
The Minister of Terling in
Essex for example,

00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:04.590
a parish--little parish--down
in central Essex,

00:40:04.590 --> 00:40:08.510
left when browbeat--after being
browbeaten--

00:40:08.510 --> 00:40:11.797
by Laud and deprived of his
living and took with him

00:40:11.797 --> 00:40:14.119
thirteen members of his
community.

00:40:14.119 --> 00:40:17.969
They founded Roxbury,
Massachusetts.

00:40:17.969 --> 00:40:23.730
In 1633, once he had become
Archbishop of Canterbury,

00:40:23.730 --> 00:40:27.335
Laud ordered that communion
tables should be removed from

00:40:27.335 --> 00:40:31.007
their position close to the
center of the chancel and they

00:40:31.007 --> 00:40:35.130
should be placed at the east end
of the church like altars,

00:40:35.130 --> 00:40:39.500
suitably dressed in appropriate
cloths,

00:40:39.500 --> 00:40:44.643
and railed in to create a holy
space at the east end of the

00:40:44.643 --> 00:40:45.530
chancel.
 

00:40:45.530 --> 00:40:49.329
This was anathema to Puritans,
but he required it,

00:40:49.329 --> 00:40:54.012
and he used his metropolitan
visitation as archbishop to

00:40:54.012 --> 00:40:58.949
demand conformity to this new
ritualism in every church.

00:40:58.949 --> 00:41:03.074
Church wardens who refused to
obey were hauled before him and

00:41:03.074 --> 00:41:04.518
sometimes punished.
 

00:41:04.518 --> 00:41:10.940
In 1633, he also issued what
was known as the Book of Sports,

00:41:10.940 --> 00:41:15.119
a declaration in the King's
name that traditional sports,

00:41:15.119 --> 00:41:19.501
festivities and leisure
activities would be permitted

00:41:19.501 --> 00:41:23.744
upon Sundays,
and every minister was ordered

00:41:23.744 --> 00:41:26.639
to read it out in his church.
 

00:41:26.639 --> 00:41:30.070
This again was anathema to
Puritan ministers.

00:41:30.070 --> 00:41:35.505
Many refused to do it and they
were punished and deprived of

00:41:35.505 --> 00:41:36.980
their livings.
 

00:41:36.980 --> 00:41:39.800
Altogether, throughout the
Arminian controlled church,

00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:44.038
a new and stricter definition
of the nature of Anglican

00:41:44.038 --> 00:41:48.119
conformity was being rigorously
enforced by Laud,

00:41:48.119 --> 00:41:52.710
and he had a very sharp way
indeed of dealing with

00:41:52.710 --> 00:41:53.929
dissidents.
 

00:41:53.929 --> 00:41:56.659
Three of the most famous
dissidents who smuggled in

00:41:56.659 --> 00:41:59.715
anti-Arminian books from the
Netherlands to escape Laud's

00:41:59.715 --> 00:42:03.420
censorship of the press,
were arrested in 1637,

00:42:03.420 --> 00:42:09.014
'38, and severely punished by
Laud acting from the Court of

00:42:09.014 --> 00:42:13.739
Star Chamber of which he was a
leading member.

00:42:13.739 --> 00:42:17.682
They were pilloried;
they had their ears slit off,

00:42:17.682 --> 00:42:18.940
for example.
 

00:42:18.940 --> 00:42:21.659
And the result of all this?
 

00:42:21.659 --> 00:42:26.907
Well, one result was a far more
rapid growth of the Puritan

00:42:26.907 --> 00:42:32.065
colonies in New England than
would otherwise have been the

00:42:32.065 --> 00:42:32.880
case.
 

00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:38.175
Thousands of the most dedicated
of the Puritan clergy and groups

00:42:38.175 --> 00:42:42.800
of their lay followers finally
despaired of England,

00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:48.106
despaired of the hope of
reformation in this context and

00:42:48.106 --> 00:42:53.318
left to create a godly
commonwealth of their own in the

00:42:53.318 --> 00:42:54.670
New World.
 

00:42:54.670 --> 00:42:57.460
And within England?
 

00:42:57.460 --> 00:43:01.250
Well, it's possible that in
some, perhaps many,

00:43:01.250 --> 00:43:06.275
parishes some aspects of Laud's
Arminian policies were perhaps

00:43:06.275 --> 00:43:07.760
not unwelcome.
 

00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:12.625
One could say that it was a way
of putting an end to the

00:43:12.625 --> 00:43:17.666
parochial controversy and
reasserting order and discipline

00:43:17.666 --> 00:43:19.260
in the church.
 

00:43:19.260 --> 00:43:21.840
Some may well have welcomed
that.

00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:25.820
It offered a doctrine of
salvation which was somewhat

00:43:25.820 --> 00:43:30.260
easier and more generous than
Calvinist predestination,

00:43:30.260 --> 00:43:35.570
perhaps closer to the needs and
understandings of simple folk.

00:43:35.570 --> 00:43:39.626
And perhaps the brand of
religious practice focused on

00:43:39.626 --> 00:43:43.684
the prayer book and the
sacraments which was something

00:43:43.684 --> 00:43:48.429
which might be more inclusive at
the level of the parish,

00:43:48.429 --> 00:43:52.789
less individually demanding on
the population.

00:43:52.789 --> 00:43:53.719
Perhaps.
 

00:43:53.719 --> 00:43:57.289
All these positive features
have been suggested in an

00:43:57.289 --> 00:44:01.202
interesting book by Judith
Maltby on attitudes towards the

00:44:01.202 --> 00:44:03.329
Prayer Book in this period.
 

00:44:03.329 --> 00:44:07.746
But in many parishes it was
also the case that the policies

00:44:07.746 --> 00:44:11.630
of William Laud and the
Arminians themselves brought

00:44:11.630 --> 00:44:12.619
conflict.
 

00:44:12.619 --> 00:44:16.900
There was widespread alarm at
their ceremonial innovations.

00:44:16.900 --> 00:44:22.179
There was widespread suspicion
of their ultimate intentions.

00:44:22.179 --> 00:44:26.251
There was widespread resentment
and frustration amongst the

00:44:26.251 --> 00:44:29.831
godly folk who remained in
English parishes that the

00:44:29.831 --> 00:44:34.911
reformation had been stopped,
that perhaps it was being

00:44:34.911 --> 00:44:39.539
reversed before it had even been
half won.

00:44:39.539 --> 00:44:43.630
That in itself was a new cause
for discontent,

00:44:43.630 --> 00:44:47.492
a new cause for controversy,
a new cause for what have been

00:44:47.492 --> 00:44:50.489
called "street wars of
religion."

00:44:50.489 --> 00:44:53.804
A source of increased
bitterness in such

00:44:53.804 --> 00:44:58.806
controversies,
a bitterness which spilled over

00:44:58.806 --> 00:45:03.458
into political life,
sharpening and intensifying

00:45:03.458 --> 00:45:08.425
other sources of conflict which
were coming to light between the

00:45:08.425 --> 00:45:12.840
royal government and members of
the political nation.

00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:16.307
And it's to those other sources
of conflict that I'll turn next

00:45:16.307 --> 00:45:16.699
time.
 

00:45:16.699 --> 00:45:22.000

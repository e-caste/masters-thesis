00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:10.938
Prof: So today we're
still focused on individual

00:00:10.938 --> 00:00:13.610
consciousness.
 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:14.880
"Why?" you might ask.
 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:21.038
Well, we can speak of the
psychogenesis of the text or

00:00:21.038 --> 00:00:28.010
film as the site or model for
symbolic patterning of one sort

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.333
or another,
perhaps in the case certainly

00:00:31.333 --> 00:00:36.950
of Žižek,
to some extent also of Deleuze.

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:41.651
Therefore we can still
understand today's readings,

00:00:41.651 --> 00:00:45.976
unlike Thursday's readings,
as belonging to the

00:00:45.976 --> 00:00:50.020
psychological emphasis in our
syllabus.

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.520
This is actually our farewell
to the psychological emphasis,

00:00:54.520 --> 00:01:02.460
and it is so arranged because
there are intimations in today's

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.930
authors that there are political
stakes.

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.552
That is to say,
in one way or another we are to

00:01:11.552 --> 00:01:16.119
understand their argument about
the way in which the psyche

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:19.819
functions as having political
implications.

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:23.840
Žižek is fascinating,
it seems to me,

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.912
in his brilliant reading of
The Crying Game at the

00:01:26.912 --> 00:01:29.903
very end of your essay,
in the moment when he says in

00:01:29.903 --> 00:01:31.274
effect,
"Look.

00:01:31.274 --> 00:01:35.694
This isn't just a kind of
abdication from responsibility

00:01:35.694 --> 00:01:38.830
for the Irish Republican
Revolution.

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:45.590
The soldier has not merely
walked away from his role in

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.785
revolutionary activity;
he has discovered in his

00:01:50.785 --> 00:01:55.861
private life--that is to say,
in the erotic dimension of his

00:01:55.861 --> 00:02:00.510
consciousness--the need for
revolution from within.

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:06.956
He has necessarily disrupted
his own thinking in ways equally

00:02:06.956 --> 00:02:13.403
radical to and closely parallel
to the disruption of thinking

00:02:13.403 --> 00:02:19.420
that's required to understand
one's relationship with the

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.150
emerging Republican status of
Ireland.

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.400
And so,"
says Žižek in effect,

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:32.401
"there are political
implications for the upheaval in

00:02:32.401 --> 00:02:38.824
consciousness that an ultimately
tragic encounter with the Big

00:02:38.824 --> 00:02:40.720
Other entails.
 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.720
I should say in passing also
about Žižek that --

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.428
and your editor,
I think, goes into this a

00:02:47.428 --> 00:02:50.068
little bit in the italicized
preface--

00:02:50.068 --> 00:02:53.910
that there are temptations,
political temptations,

00:02:53.910 --> 00:03:00.824
entailed in this fascination
with an obscure or even perhaps

00:03:00.824 --> 00:03:06.919
transcendent object of desire
for the individual,

00:03:06.919 --> 00:03:09.250
but also for the social psyche.
 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.139
In religious terms,
there is a perhaps surprising

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:18.003
or counterintuitive friendliness
toward religion in Žižek's

00:03:18.003 --> 00:03:23.030
work on the grounds that faith
or the struggle for faith,

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.917
after, all does constitute an
effort to enter into some kind

00:03:27.917 --> 00:03:32.887
of meaningful relationship with
that which one desires yet at

00:03:32.887 --> 00:03:35.288
the same time can't have.
 

00:03:35.288 --> 00:03:39.508
By the same token--and this is
where,

00:03:39.508 --> 00:03:43.371
in certain moments,
he confesses to a kind of

00:03:43.371 --> 00:03:46.970
instability in his political
thinking,

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:50.622
even though he is by and large
on the left and partly needs to

00:03:50.622 --> 00:03:52.960
be understood as a disciple of
Marx--

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.966
nevertheless,
he recognizes that in politics

00:03:56.966 --> 00:04:00.878
there is a kind of excitement
but also,

00:04:00.878 --> 00:04:04.688
perhaps, potential danger in
fascination with a big idea.

00:04:04.688 --> 00:04:07.748
It could be,
of course, some form of

00:04:07.748 --> 00:04:10.110
progressive collectivity.
 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.716
It could, on the other hand,
be the kind of big idea that

00:04:13.716 --> 00:04:15.968
countenances the rise of
fascism.

00:04:15.968 --> 00:04:24.774
Žižek acknowledges this--
that public identification with

00:04:24.774 --> 00:04:28.822
a kind of almost,
or completely,

00:04:28.822 --> 00:04:33.213
inaccessible otherness,
either as a political idea or

00:04:33.213 --> 00:04:36.420
as a charismatic political
leader,

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:42.497
can, after all,
open up a vertigo of dangerous

00:04:42.497 --> 00:04:44.660
possibilities.
 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:47.154
I use the word
"vertigo"

00:04:47.154 --> 00:04:51.613
advisedly because I'm going to
be coming back to Hitchcock's

00:04:51.613 --> 00:04:56.312
Vertigo in just a minute,
but in the meantime there are

00:04:56.312 --> 00:04:59.199
also obviously political stakes
in Deleuze.

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:02.939
Deleuze, of course,
presents to us in this first

00:05:02.939 --> 00:05:06.382
chapter of his book,
A Thousand Plateaus,

00:05:06.382 --> 00:05:10.100
he presents to us a kind of
thought experiment,

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:13.379
both as something recommended
to the reader--

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:19.019
see if you can think in this
new, radically innovative way--

00:05:19.019 --> 00:05:23.262
but also providing a model for
thinking of this kind in the

00:05:23.262 --> 00:05:27.064
style and organization and
composition of the chapter

00:05:27.064 --> 00:05:27.870
itself.
 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:29.970
So in making a thought
experiment,

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:34.279
once again, Deleuze has to
perform in thought what you

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:37.449
might call a revolution from
within,

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:41.029
but the implications once again
in politics,

00:05:41.029 --> 00:05:44.920
as indeed also for Žižek,
are somewhat ambiguous.

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:48.310
That is to say,
the rhizomatic mode of

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:51.607
thinking--
and we'll come back to the

00:05:51.607 --> 00:05:55.410
rhizomatic mode of thinking as
we go along--

00:05:55.410 --> 00:06:01.180
which is radically de-centering
and which lends itself to

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:06.041
identification with,
as it were, the mass movement

00:06:06.041 --> 00:06:10.423
of collectivity,
can plainly be progressively

00:06:10.423 --> 00:06:15.892
democratic: that is to say,
democratic beyond even what our

00:06:15.892 --> 00:06:19.569
social and cultural hierarchies
accommodate.

00:06:19.569 --> 00:06:25.060
But at the same time it can
once again be fascistic,

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:29.910
because the organization of
fascistic culture,

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:35.137
while nevertheless a kind of
top-down arrangement with a

00:06:35.137 --> 00:06:39.319
fervor involved as the mass is
mobilized,

00:06:39.319 --> 00:06:43.079
nevertheless is,
in this mobilization,

00:06:43.079 --> 00:06:44.399
rhizomatic.
 

00:06:44.399 --> 00:06:47.750
Deleuze is careful to point out
that rhizomes are,

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:51.101
and rhizomatic thinking is,
as he says repeatedly,

00:06:51.101 --> 00:06:53.904
both for the best and
worst.

00:06:53.904 --> 00:06:55.819
&gt;
 

00:06:55.819 --> 00:06:57.579
Rats are rhizomes.
 

00:06:57.579 --> 00:06:59.889
Crabgrass is a rhizome.
 

00:06:59.889 --> 00:07:03.103
In other words,
everything which organizes

00:07:03.103 --> 00:07:06.160
itself in this fashion is
rhizomatic;

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:09.588
much of it, though,
as I'll be coming back to try

00:07:09.588 --> 00:07:13.372
to explain with a little more
care, is for the good in

00:07:13.372 --> 00:07:14.730
Deleuze's view.
 

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:16.418
By the way, I say
"Deleuze"

00:07:16.418 --> 00:07:18.528
in the same way I said
"Wimsatt."

00:07:18.528 --> 00:07:22.310
Guattari is an important
colleague and ally.

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:25.386
They wrote many books together
including one that I'll mention

00:07:25.386 --> 00:07:25.790
later.
 

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:27.980
They also wrote things
separately, but

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:30.822
"Deleuze,"
simply because his oeuvre

00:07:30.822 --> 00:07:34.139
is more ample and people
feel somehow or another that

00:07:34.139 --> 00:07:38.016
he's more central to this work,
is a synecdoche for

00:07:38.016 --> 00:07:40.930
"Deleuze and
Guattari."

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:43.288
So I'll be saying
"Deleuze,"

00:07:43.288 --> 00:07:45.709
but I don't mean to slight
Guattari.

00:07:45.709 --> 00:07:49.815
In any case,
so we'll be examining the

00:07:49.815 --> 00:07:55.029
Deleuzian rhizome a little bit
more closely,

00:07:55.029 --> 00:07:57.468
but in the meantime,
as to its political

00:07:57.468 --> 00:08:01.048
implications--
and we are moving closer to the

00:08:01.048 --> 00:08:06.040
political as we begin to think
about figures of this kind--

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:10.127
they're really on the admission
of both of them somewhat

00:08:10.127 --> 00:08:11.019
ambiguous.
 

00:08:11.019 --> 00:08:13.050
In other words,
they're introducing new

00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:16.257
possibilities of thought and
they're very different from each

00:08:16.257 --> 00:08:17.540
other, as we'll see.
 

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:20.519
They're introducing new
possibilities of thought,

00:08:20.519 --> 00:08:24.807
but they are candid enough to
admit that they don't quite know

00:08:24.807 --> 00:08:27.550
where these possibilities are
going--

00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:32.504
that is, what the implications
or consequences of successfully

00:08:32.504 --> 00:08:37.379
entering the thought world of
either one of them might be.

00:08:37.379 --> 00:08:38.508
All right.
 

00:08:38.508 --> 00:08:44.149
So yes, they certainly have
very different ideas.

00:08:44.149 --> 00:08:46.562
I wouldn't blame you for
saying, "Why on earth are

00:08:46.562 --> 00:08:48.529
we reading these two texts
together?"

00:08:48.529 --> 00:08:51.940
The overlap isn't altogether
clear.

00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:56.114
I'm going to suggest what it is
in a minute, but in the meantime

00:08:56.114 --> 00:08:59.558
they are certainly on about very
different things.

00:08:59.558 --> 00:09:04.028
Deleuze is concerned with,
as I say,

00:09:04.028 --> 00:09:07.524
introducing a kind of thought
experiment which has to do with

00:09:07.524 --> 00:09:11.291
the de-centering of thought,
getting away from the tree or

00:09:11.291 --> 00:09:14.562
arboresque model of thought--
we'll have more to say about

00:09:14.562 --> 00:09:15.996
that;
and Žižek,

00:09:15.996 --> 00:09:20.571
on the other hand,
following Lacan's distinction

00:09:20.571 --> 00:09:23.993
between the object,
ready to hand,

00:09:23.993 --> 00:09:28.375
that you can have if you want,
and the object of desire

00:09:28.375 --> 00:09:31.450
which--such is the chain of
signification--

00:09:31.450 --> 00:09:35.697
is perpetually something that
exceeds or outdistances our

00:09:35.697 --> 00:09:38.211
grasp--
in developing this idea,

00:09:38.211 --> 00:09:41.798
and thinking about what the
object of desire,

00:09:41.798 --> 00:09:44.960
in all of its manifold forms,
might be,

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:48.051
he develops this curious idea,
which is at the center of his

00:09:48.051 --> 00:09:52.029
thinking,
of the blot--the element

00:09:52.029 --> 00:09:56.226
in narrative form,
the element in the way in which

00:09:56.226 --> 00:09:59.120
our storytelling capacities are
organized,

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:05.111
which really can't be narrated,
which really can't lend itself

00:10:05.111 --> 00:10:06.389
to meaning.
 

00:10:06.389 --> 00:10:09.413
That sort of meaning is,
of course, concrete,

00:10:09.413 --> 00:10:12.642
specific meaning,
that which can be tied down to

00:10:12.642 --> 00:10:14.360
an accessible object.
 

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:19.916
So the central idea that
Žižek is attempting to develop

00:10:19.916 --> 00:10:25.671
in his essay has to do with this
notion of the relationship

00:10:25.671 --> 00:10:29.639
between the Big Other and the
blot,

00:10:29.639 --> 00:10:30.480
as we'll see.
 

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:34.279
So these strike one as being
extremely different ideas,

00:10:34.279 --> 00:10:38.220
and as I say I wouldn't blame
you for wondering just what

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:39.980
overlap there can be.
 

00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:46.791
Well, at the same time I would
think that as you read the

00:10:46.791 --> 00:10:54.090
somewhat bouncy and frantic
prose of both of these texts,

00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:57.080
you did see that they had a
kind of mood,

00:10:57.080 --> 00:11:03.563
stance, or orientation toward
the critical and theoretical

00:11:03.563 --> 00:11:05.840
project in common.
 

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:09.960
They seem, in other words,
to be of the same moment.

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:13.308
Even though their ideas seem to
be so very different--

00:11:13.308 --> 00:11:15.543
that is, the basic ideas
they're trying to get across

00:11:15.543 --> 00:11:18.811
seem to be so very different--
you could perhaps imagine these

00:11:18.811 --> 00:11:21.761
two texts as being written,
if it was just a question of

00:11:21.761 --> 00:11:24.678
considering their style,
by the same person.

00:11:24.678 --> 00:11:27.668
Actually, I think that's not
quite true,

00:11:27.668 --> 00:11:31.840
but at the same time the kind
of high-energy,

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:37.488
too-caffeinated feeling that
you get from the prose of both

00:11:37.488 --> 00:11:43.135
is something that might give you
pause and make you wonder:

00:11:43.135 --> 00:11:46.659
well,
just what moment does this

00:11:46.659 --> 00:11:47.740
belong to?
 

00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:51.320
The answer is important and,
in a way, obvious.

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:55.341
I'm sure all of you are ready
to tell me what moment it

00:11:55.341 --> 00:11:56.309
belongs to.
 

00:11:56.309 --> 00:11:59.418
It belongs to Postmodernism.
 

00:11:59.418 --> 00:12:04.302
These are two exemplars of what
is by far the most slippery--if

00:12:04.302 --> 00:12:07.451
one likes it,
one wants to say versatile,

00:12:07.451 --> 00:12:09.500
&gt;
 

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:12.475
and if one doesn't like it,
one wants to say

00:12:12.475 --> 00:12:16.835
murky--concepts to which we have
been exposed in the last twenty

00:12:16.835 --> 00:12:18.220
or thirty years.
 

00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:21.774
I think that,
in a way, we can bring both

00:12:21.774 --> 00:12:27.548
essays into focus as a pair a
little bit if we pause somewhat,

00:12:27.548 --> 00:12:31.158
simply over the concept
"Postmodernism."

00:12:31.158 --> 00:12:34.793
Maybe that's one of the things
you wanted to learn in taking a

00:12:34.793 --> 00:12:37.176
course like this,
so I'm just providing a

00:12:37.176 --> 00:12:37.652
service.
 

00:12:37.652 --> 00:12:39.379
&gt;
 

00:12:39.379 --> 00:12:41.909
So Postmodernism.
 

00:12:41.909 --> 00:12:45.750
What is Postmodernism?
 

00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:49.100
I think we know what it is in
artistic expression.

00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:53.168
We have encountered enough
examples of it.

00:12:53.168 --> 00:12:56.429
We have, perhaps,
even taken courses in which,

00:12:56.429 --> 00:12:59.763
in the context of artistic form
and expression,

00:12:59.763 --> 00:13:01.139
it has come up.
 

00:13:01.139 --> 00:13:03.830
Postmodernism in artistic
expression--

00:13:03.830 --> 00:13:07.721
particularly in the visual
arts, but I think this is true

00:13:07.721 --> 00:13:11.960
of certain movements in both
narrative and poetry as well--

00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:16.840
postmodernism is an eclectic
orientation to the past.

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:19.879
In a certain sense,
it's a return to the past;

00:13:19.879 --> 00:13:24.841
it's an opening up of textual
possibility to traditions and

00:13:24.841 --> 00:13:30.061
historical moments of expression
which Modernism had tended to

00:13:30.061 --> 00:13:33.740
suppose obsolete and to have set
aside;

00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:39.676
so that in artistic expression,
as I say, Postmodernism is an

00:13:39.676 --> 00:13:45.909
eclectic return to possibilities
thrown up by the history of art

00:13:45.909 --> 00:13:48.880
and literature;
in architecture,

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:52.020
many examples are quite
extraordinary and many,

00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:54.408
unfortunately,
are also hideous.

00:13:54.408 --> 00:13:57.517
You know that there was a
certain point fifteen or twenty

00:13:57.517 --> 00:14:01.288
years ago when every strip mall,
every shopping mall,

00:14:01.288 --> 00:14:03.942
was redecorated or--
what's the word I

00:14:03.942 --> 00:14:04.720
want?--renovated.
 

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:06.970
Every shopping mall was
renovated, and how did they

00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:07.600
renovate it?
 

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:09.350
They'd been flat.
 

00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:13.104
They'd been sort of Mies van
der Rohe, sort of sixties-modern

00:14:13.104 --> 00:14:13.980
before then.
 

00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:17.605
They just sat there flat,
and so the renovators came

00:14:17.605 --> 00:14:21.870
along and put little gables on
the shopping mall so that each

00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:25.070
little shop in the mall now has
a gable,

00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:27.019
and this is postmodern.
 

00:14:27.019 --> 00:14:30.090
The most awful things were done
with suburban houses,

00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:34.788
also in the name of a kind of
blind,

00:14:34.788 --> 00:14:39.950
completely tasteless return to
the neoclassical and certain

00:14:39.950 --> 00:14:42.529
other aspects of tradition.
 

00:14:42.529 --> 00:14:46.715
So the postmodern in what you
might call suburban culture has

00:14:46.715 --> 00:14:50.072
been pretty awful,
but at the same time it has

00:14:50.072 --> 00:14:53.928
entailed a great deal of
interesting work in painting.

00:14:53.928 --> 00:14:56.682
All of a sudden,
the New York scene isn't just

00:14:56.682 --> 00:14:59.129
one school, and that's the sign
of it.

00:14:59.129 --> 00:15:01.500
It's not just a certain kind of
abstraction.

00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:07.315
It's not just a wholesale
return, agreed on by everyone,

00:15:07.315 --> 00:15:08.690
to Realism.
 

00:15:08.690 --> 00:15:14.048
It's a mixture of everything.
 

00:15:14.048 --> 00:15:17.422
Artists are always just
completely obsessed with their

00:15:17.422 --> 00:15:20.607
place in art history,
but it's not just groups of

00:15:20.607 --> 00:15:23.988
artists together wanting to
identify a certain place for

00:15:23.988 --> 00:15:25.769
themselves in art history.
 

00:15:25.769 --> 00:15:30.118
It's every artist in a kind of
anarchic independence from the

00:15:30.118 --> 00:15:34.755
thinking of other artists coming
to terms with art history in his

00:15:34.755 --> 00:15:37.509
or her own way so that the
scene--

00:15:37.509 --> 00:15:41.576
the art scenes of New York and
Berlin and Los Angeles and so

00:15:41.576 --> 00:15:43.904
on--
the scene isn't something that

00:15:43.904 --> 00:15:47.480
you can identify as having a
certain character anymore.

00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:51.009
It's postmodern precisely in
that it's gone global,

00:15:51.009 --> 00:15:54.639
it has a million influences and
sources,

00:15:54.639 --> 00:15:57.932
and there is very little
agreement among artists about

00:15:57.932 --> 00:16:01.100
how to amalgamate and put these
sources together;

00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:04.200
so that in terms of artistic
expression,

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:08.788
the postmodern moment--after
Modernism,

00:16:08.788 --> 00:16:12.298
in other words--the postmodern
moment presents itself,

00:16:12.298 --> 00:16:15.840
and I put it deliberately,
as a medical symptom,

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:20.139
the bipolar way the postmodern
moment presents itself in

00:16:20.139 --> 00:16:21.860
artistic expression.
 

00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:26.408
Now philosophically,
Postmodernism can be understood

00:16:26.408 --> 00:16:31.225
as doubt not just about the
grounds of knowledge or the

00:16:31.225 --> 00:16:36.754
widespread sorts of doubt which
we have been talking about more

00:16:36.754 --> 00:16:40.590
or less continuously in this
course,

00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:45.850
but as doubt in particular
about the relationship between

00:16:45.850 --> 00:16:48.480
or among parts and wholes.
 

00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:52.500
In other words,
can I be sure that my leg is

00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:58.389
part of my body when plainly it
is at the same time a whole with

00:16:58.389 --> 00:17:00.538
respect to my foot?
 

00:17:00.538 --> 00:17:06.030
How is it that I know in any
stable way what a part or a

00:17:06.030 --> 00:17:07.130
whole is?
 

00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:08.788
To take a more interesting
example--

00:17:08.788 --> 00:17:11.645
this is in Wittgenstein's
Philosophical

00:17:11.645 --> 00:17:14.174
Investigations--
there is the flag,

00:17:14.174 --> 00:17:17.564
the French flag,
which is called the tricolor,

00:17:17.564 --> 00:17:18.130
right?
 

00:17:18.130 --> 00:17:21.804
Now the tricolor is made up of
three strips of color:

00:17:21.804 --> 00:17:23.430
white, blue,
and red.

00:17:23.430 --> 00:17:25.740
I'm sorry if I've gotten the
order wrong.

00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:28.058
In fact, I am almost positive
that I have,

00:17:28.058 --> 00:17:29.528
&gt;
 

00:17:29.528 --> 00:17:32.903
but there are those three
strips of color existing in

00:17:32.903 --> 00:17:36.470
relation to each other,
and plainly those three strips

00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:40.597
of color are parts of the flag,
and they have a certain

00:17:40.597 --> 00:17:42.029
symbolic value.
 

00:17:42.029 --> 00:17:46.032
That is to say,
each color represents something

00:17:46.032 --> 00:17:51.079
and enters into the symbolic
understanding of what the flag

00:17:51.079 --> 00:17:51.690
is.
 

00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:55.911
But at the same time red,
white, and blue--sorry--yes,

00:17:55.911 --> 00:18:00.848
red, white, and blue aren't
confined to this piece of cloth.

00:18:00.848 --> 00:18:08.509
The little strip of white is
obviously part of whiteness.

00:18:08.509 --> 00:18:16.140
It can't be understood simply
in and of itelf.

00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:18.088
These strips of color are parts
of other things as well;

00:18:18.088 --> 00:18:21.303
and what's more,
if you look at the tricolor

00:18:21.303 --> 00:18:25.711
without knowing what you're
looking at, how can you say that

00:18:25.711 --> 00:18:27.880
it's the part of a whole?
 

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:31.311
You say, "Well,
they're just parts,"

00:18:31.311 --> 00:18:35.354
or "They're wholes unto
themselves which somebody

00:18:35.354 --> 00:18:38.710
happens to have laid side by
side."

00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:42.913
By the same token,
if you look at the part of the

00:18:42.913 --> 00:18:46.329
tricolor which is white and you
say,

00:18:46.329 --> 00:18:51.054
"White," well,
obviously with respect to the

00:18:51.054 --> 00:18:55.032
vast universalizing concept
"white,"

00:18:55.032 --> 00:19:00.338
a little flag is simply a kind
of metonymic relationship with

00:19:00.338 --> 00:19:02.548
that sense of white.
 

00:19:02.548 --> 00:19:05.317
But, in short,
to concretize this idea of the

00:19:05.317 --> 00:19:09.153
problematic relationship between
part and whole in a different

00:19:09.153 --> 00:19:13.096
way,
why are we so confident about

00:19:13.096 --> 00:19:14.608
what we see?
 

00:19:14.608 --> 00:19:18.203
As most of you know,
I'm sure, philosophical

00:19:18.203 --> 00:19:22.970
thinking tends to be tyrannized
by metaphors of vision.

00:19:22.970 --> 00:19:27.130
We assume that we understand
reality because--

00:19:27.130 --> 00:19:31.758
not altogether as consciously
metaphorically in speaking about

00:19:31.758 --> 00:19:36.740
this as perhaps we might be--
we say that we can see it;

00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:39.608
but how do you see it?
 

00:19:39.608 --> 00:19:43.471
You see it because of the
lensing or focusing capacities

00:19:43.471 --> 00:19:47.615
of the eye, which exercise a
certain tyranny over the nature

00:19:47.615 --> 00:19:49.019
of what you see.
 

00:19:49.019 --> 00:19:52.780
If you look too closely at
something, all you can see is

00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:53.259
dots.
 

00:19:53.259 --> 00:19:57.065
If you look at something and
close your eyes,

00:19:57.065 --> 00:20:01.474
that, too, becomes a kind of
vast retinal Mark Tobey

00:20:01.474 --> 00:20:02.598
painting.
 

00:20:02.598 --> 00:20:07.795
It has a relation to what you
see but is at the same time

00:20:07.795 --> 00:20:10.298
something very different.
 

00:20:10.298 --> 00:20:13.077
And if you get too far away
from objects,

00:20:13.077 --> 00:20:14.190
they dissolve.
 

00:20:14.190 --> 00:20:18.904
What you thought was an object
dissolves into a much vaster,

00:20:18.904 --> 00:20:23.778
greater space which seems to
have another objective nature.

00:20:23.778 --> 00:20:28.170
If you're in a jet and you're
looking down,

00:20:28.170 --> 00:20:32.223
what you're seeing certainly
looks like it has form and

00:20:32.223 --> 00:20:35.075
structure,
but the form and structure is

00:20:35.075 --> 00:20:39.019
not at all what you're seeing if
you're standing on the ground

00:20:39.019 --> 00:20:42.192
looking at exactly the same,
shall we say,

00:20:42.192 --> 00:20:45.160
square footage insofar as you
can.

00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:47.700
You're simply seeing different
things,

00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:51.949
and if you recognize what might
be called the tyranny of focus

00:20:51.949 --> 00:20:55.848
in the way in which we orient
ourselves to the world,

00:20:55.848 --> 00:21:00.280
you can see this perpetual
dissolve and refocus

00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:04.808
constituting objects perpetually
in new ways.

00:21:04.808 --> 00:21:07.358
This happens,
too, in the history of science.

00:21:07.358 --> 00:21:11.201
The relationship between
subatomic particles sometimes

00:21:11.201 --> 00:21:14.663
turns itself inside out,
and the particle that you

00:21:14.663 --> 00:21:17.368
thought was the fundamental unit
turns out,

00:21:17.368 --> 00:21:24.467
in fact, to have within it a
fundamental unit of which it is

00:21:24.467 --> 00:21:25.548
a part.
 

00:21:25.548 --> 00:21:30.544
I'm just referring to what
happened during the golden age

00:21:30.544 --> 00:21:36.073
of the linear accelerator when
all sorts of remarkable sorts of

00:21:36.073 --> 00:21:41.512
inversions of what's taken to be
fundamental seemed to be made

00:21:41.512 --> 00:21:45.170
available by the experimental
data;

00:21:45.170 --> 00:21:50.846
so that in all of these ways,
ranging from scientific to the

00:21:50.846 --> 00:21:56.618
most subjectively visual ways of
understanding the world,

00:21:56.618 --> 00:22:01.106
there are possibilities of
doubt that can be raised about

00:22:01.106 --> 00:22:02.950
part-whole relations.
 

00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:04.809
What is a whole?
 

00:22:04.809 --> 00:22:07.380
How do we define a unity?
 

00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:13.804
Should we be preoccupied with
the nature of reality as a set

00:22:13.804 --> 00:22:15.220
of unities?
 

00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:18.220
Obviously, Deleuze is extremely
upset about this.

00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:21.240
He doesn't want anything to do
with unity.

00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:26.038
The whole function of his
thought experiment is the

00:22:26.038 --> 00:22:31.795
de-centering of things such that
one can no longer talk about

00:22:31.795 --> 00:22:35.730
units or wholes or isolated
entities.

00:22:35.730 --> 00:22:39.250
It's the being together,
merging together,

00:22:39.250 --> 00:22:43.557
flying apart,
reuniting, and kinesis or

00:22:43.557 --> 00:22:47.931
movement of entities,
if they can even be called

00:22:47.931 --> 00:22:51.568
entities,
that Deleuze is concerned with.

00:22:51.568 --> 00:22:55.904
Now another aspect of the
postmodern is what the

00:22:55.904 --> 00:23:00.980
postmodern philosopher
Jean-François Lyotard,

00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:03.290
in particular,
has called "the

00:23:03.290 --> 00:23:05.604
inhuman"
or the process of the

00:23:05.604 --> 00:23:07.778
dehumanization of the human.
 

00:23:07.778 --> 00:23:11.633
Now this is a weird term to
choose because it's not at all

00:23:11.633 --> 00:23:12.848
anti-humanistic.
 

00:23:12.848 --> 00:23:15.769
It's really a new way of
thinking about the human.

00:23:15.769 --> 00:23:20.392
Deleuze, you'll notice,
talks--not just here in this

00:23:20.392 --> 00:23:23.476
excerpt,
but repeatedly throughout his

00:23:23.476 --> 00:23:26.009
work,
which is why he has so little

00:23:26.009 --> 00:23:28.950
to say about it here that's
explanatory--

00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:31.900
about "bodies without
organs."

00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:36.727
That might have brought you up
short, but what it suggests is

00:23:36.727 --> 00:23:41.314
that we are, as Deleuze would
put it, machinic rather than

00:23:41.314 --> 00:23:42.279
organic.
 

00:23:42.279 --> 00:23:47.238
If the problem with centered
thought is that it thinks of

00:23:47.238 --> 00:23:52.102
everything as arboreal,
as a tree, that problem has to

00:23:52.102 --> 00:23:56.971
do with the fact that a tree is
understood in its symbolic

00:23:56.971 --> 00:23:59.450
extensions to have organs.
 

00:23:59.450 --> 00:24:03.509
The roots are muscles and
circulation;

00:24:03.509 --> 00:24:06.528
the blossoms are genital in
nature;

00:24:06.528 --> 00:24:12.278
the crown or canopy of leaves
is the mind of the tree reaching

00:24:12.278 --> 00:24:16.328
up to the sky,
the mentality of the tree.

00:24:16.328 --> 00:24:20.173
By the same token,
if we think of our own bodies

00:24:20.173 --> 00:24:23.230
as arboreal,
we think of certain parts of

00:24:23.230 --> 00:24:27.452
those bodies as cognitive,
other parts of those bodies as

00:24:27.452 --> 00:24:30.078
having agency,
as doing things.

00:24:30.078 --> 00:24:34.746
If that's the case,
then we think of a centered and

00:24:34.746 --> 00:24:40.066
ultimately genital or genetic
understanding of the body as

00:24:40.066 --> 00:24:42.680
being productive.
 

00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:46.986
Deleuze wants to understand the
body as being interactive,

00:24:46.986 --> 00:24:50.990
as being polymorphous perverse,
among other things.

00:24:50.990 --> 00:24:55.404
He wants to understand it as
being everywhere and nowhere,

00:24:55.404 --> 00:24:58.578
an un-situated body among other
bodies.

00:24:58.578 --> 00:25:04.808
In order for this to happen,
its interface with other things

00:25:04.808 --> 00:25:11.144
has to be without agency and
also without cognitive intention

00:25:11.144 --> 00:25:15.828
on the model of "I think,
therefore I am;

00:25:15.828 --> 00:25:19.269
the world comes into being
because I think,"

00:25:19.269 --> 00:25:21.420
without any of this in play.
 

00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:24.836
In other words,
the dehumanization of the

00:25:24.836 --> 00:25:30.048
postmodern has to do not at all
with denying the importance of

00:25:30.048 --> 00:25:35.003
the human but with this radical
way of rethinking the human

00:25:35.003 --> 00:25:38.078
among other bodies and things.
 

00:25:38.078 --> 00:25:43.167
Plainly, this emphasis involves
a kind of dissolving into

00:25:43.167 --> 00:25:46.657
otherness,
a continuity between subject

00:25:46.657 --> 00:25:49.710
and object in which the
difference,

00:25:49.710 --> 00:25:52.740
ultimately, between what is
inside me,

00:25:52.740 --> 00:25:58.038
what is authentic or integral
to my being me,

00:25:58.038 --> 00:26:02.593
and what's outside me become
completely permeable and

00:26:02.593 --> 00:26:04.170
interchangeable.
 

00:26:04.170 --> 00:26:10.093
The late nineteenth-century
author and aesthetic philosopher

00:26:10.093 --> 00:26:13.059
Walter Pater,
in the conclusion to a famous

00:26:13.059 --> 00:26:15.593
book of his called The
Renaissance, had a

00:26:15.593 --> 00:26:18.078
wonderful way of putting this:
he said in effect,

00:26:18.078 --> 00:26:20.778
"We are too used to
thinking that we're in here and

00:26:20.778 --> 00:26:22.788
everything else is out there and
that,

00:26:22.788 --> 00:26:27.191
somehow or another,
our perspective on everything

00:26:27.191 --> 00:26:32.692
out there is a kind of saving
isolation enabling our power of

00:26:32.692 --> 00:26:34.710
objectivity."
 

00:26:34.710 --> 00:26:36.183
Then Pater says,
paraphrased,

00:26:36.183 --> 00:26:38.817
"How can this be,
because we're made up of the

00:26:38.817 --> 00:26:40.660
same things that are out there?
 

00:26:40.660 --> 00:26:43.318
We, too, are molecular,
in other words.

00:26:43.318 --> 00:26:48.108
What is in us ‘rusts iron
and ripens corn' [his words].

00:26:48.108 --> 00:26:53.782
There is a continuousness
between the inside feeling we

00:26:53.782 --> 00:26:59.771
have about ourselves and the
exteriority with which we are

00:26:59.771 --> 00:27:03.868
constantly coming in
contact."

00:27:03.868 --> 00:27:07.742
Deleuze and Guattari,
of course, have their own

00:27:07.742 --> 00:27:10.781
excited,
jumpy way of putting these

00:27:10.781 --> 00:27:15.654
things, but it's not really a
new idea that we exaggerate the

00:27:15.654 --> 00:27:19.880
isolation of consciousness from
its surroundings.

00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:26.468
There is a permeability of
inside and outside that this

00:27:26.468 --> 00:27:30.372
kind of rhizomic,
or de-centered,

00:27:30.372 --> 00:27:34.519
thinking is meant to focus on.
 

00:27:34.519 --> 00:27:39.759
Now you could say that what
Deleuze is interested in--

00:27:39.759 --> 00:27:43.810
if you go back to our
coordinates that we kept when we

00:27:43.810 --> 00:27:46.640
were talking about the
formalists,

00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:49.490
Saussure through structuralism,
through deconstruction--

00:27:49.490 --> 00:27:51.029
if you go back to those
coordinates,

00:27:51.029 --> 00:27:54.000
you could say that what Deleuze
is interested in,

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:59.068
like so many others we've read,
is a rendering virtual,

00:27:59.068 --> 00:28:02.252
or possibly even eliminating,
of the vertical axis:

00:28:02.252 --> 00:28:06.349
in other words,
of that center or head or crown

00:28:06.349 --> 00:28:11.965
of the tree which constitutes
everything that unfolds on the

00:28:11.965 --> 00:28:14.682
horizontal axis--
be it language,

00:28:14.682 --> 00:28:17.450
be it the unconscious
structured like a language,

00:28:17.450 --> 00:28:19.618
be it whatever it might be.
 

00:28:19.618 --> 00:28:24.662
You could say that the project
of Deleuze, too,

00:28:24.662 --> 00:28:31.240
is the undoing or rendering
virtual of this vertical axis.

00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:33.585
Well, in a way,
I think that's true,

00:28:33.585 --> 00:28:36.200
but then what is the horizontal
axis?

00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:40.031
That is where the relation of
Deleuze to, let's say,

00:28:40.031 --> 00:28:44.464
deconstruction becomes a little
problematic and where we can

00:28:44.464 --> 00:28:46.720
actually see a difference.
 

00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:50.420
I'm going to compare him in
this one respect with Lacan,

00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:54.186
but I want to hasten to point
out, as I will in a minute,

00:28:54.186 --> 00:28:56.608
a divergence from Lacan as
well.

00:28:56.608 --> 00:28:59.766
You remember that in Lacan's
"Agency of the Letter"

00:28:59.766 --> 00:29:02.404
essay,
he doesn't just talk

00:29:02.404 --> 00:29:07.700
about the axis of combination as
a series of concentric circles,

00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:10.769
each one of which is made up of
little concentric circles.

00:29:10.769 --> 00:29:12.558
He doesn't just talk about that.
 

00:29:12.558 --> 00:29:17.582
He also talks about the way in
which the combinatory powers of

00:29:17.582 --> 00:29:22.923
the imaginary in language,
or desire in language,

00:29:22.923 --> 00:29:27.890
take place is like a musical
staff,

00:29:27.890 --> 00:29:31.884
so that the organization of
signs, in their contiguity with

00:29:31.884 --> 00:29:35.136
each other,
can be either melodic or

00:29:35.136 --> 00:29:37.497
harmonic;
but in any case,

00:29:37.497 --> 00:29:41.983
you can't just think of the
axis of combination as a

00:29:41.983 --> 00:29:43.920
complete linearity.
 

00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:50.348
It has dimensionality of
different kinds.

00:29:50.348 --> 00:29:55.789
That's why Deleuze and Guattari
introduce the concept of

00:29:55.789 --> 00:29:56.779
plateau.
 

00:29:56.779 --> 00:29:59.950
The book in which your excerpt
appears is called A Thousand

00:29:59.950 --> 00:30:00.730
Plateaus.
 

00:30:00.730 --> 00:30:04.661
Ultimately, the concept of
plateau is even more important

00:30:04.661 --> 00:30:07.400
to them than the concept of
rhizome,

00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:10.940
but when they introduce the
concept of plateau they're doing

00:30:10.940 --> 00:30:12.440
exactly the same thing.
 

00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:16.219
They are saying,
"We jump from sign cluster

00:30:16.219 --> 00:30:20.642
to sign cluster and not all sign
clusters are linear and

00:30:20.642 --> 00:30:22.088
uniform."
 

00:30:22.088 --> 00:30:24.381
This is where there is perhaps
a difference from

00:30:24.381 --> 00:30:25.210
deconstruction.
 

00:30:25.210 --> 00:30:29.346
Deleuze and Guattari are
interested in "multiplicity

00:30:29.346 --> 00:30:31.858
of coding,"
as they put it.

00:30:31.858 --> 00:30:36.450
They're interested in the way
in which when I think,

00:30:36.450 --> 00:30:39.646
I'm not just thinking in
language, I'm not just thinking

00:30:39.646 --> 00:30:41.606
pictorially,
and I'm not just thinking

00:30:41.606 --> 00:30:44.714
musically,
but I am leaping around among

00:30:44.714 --> 00:30:50.598
codes so that the actual thought
process is eclectic in this way.

00:30:50.598 --> 00:30:56.007
Now you could say that this is
something actually anticipated

00:30:56.007 --> 00:30:57.450
also by Lacan.
 

00:30:57.450 --> 00:31:01.375
You remember also in the
"Agency" essay

00:31:01.375 --> 00:31:05.387
that Lacan reminds us,
true inheritor of Freud which

00:31:05.387 --> 00:31:09.737
he takes himself to be,
that at the beginning of The

00:31:09.737 --> 00:31:14.749
Interpretation of Dreams,
Freud said that the decoding

00:31:14.749 --> 00:31:18.900
of the dream work is like
figuring out the puzzle of a

00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:21.724
rebus--
a rebus being one of those

00:31:21.724 --> 00:31:26.148
trick sentences which are made
up not exclusively of words but

00:31:26.148 --> 00:31:29.920
of the odd syllable or of
pictures: for example,

00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:32.440
"I 'heart' New York."
 

00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:35.900
"I 'heart' New York"
is a rebus.

00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:39.564
The dream work functions
constantly, in Freud's view,

00:31:39.564 --> 00:31:40.480
as a rebus.
 

00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:46.346
So you could say that Lacan
already introduces for Deleuze

00:31:46.346 --> 00:31:52.935
the possibility of thinking of a
multiple coding that needs to be

00:31:52.935 --> 00:32:00.038
decoded on a variety of plateaus
if it's going to make any sense.

00:32:00.038 --> 00:32:05.915
Now Deleuze's relationship with
all the figures we have been

00:32:05.915 --> 00:32:09.900
reading is rather problematic,
really.

00:32:09.900 --> 00:32:13.519
The book preceding A
Thousand Plateaus was called

00:32:13.519 --> 00:32:17.013
Anti-Oedipus,
and it is a continuous

00:32:17.013 --> 00:32:21.506
systematic attack on--
he always calls Freud "the

00:32:21.506 --> 00:32:26.040
General"--
the idea that Freud feels that

00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:32.200
the whole of our psychic lives
is completely saturated and

00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:36.088
dominated by the Oedipus
complex.

00:32:36.088 --> 00:32:39.509
Deleuze with his idea of
de-centered thinking,

00:32:39.509 --> 00:32:43.267
of the rhizome,
sets out to show in a variety

00:32:43.267 --> 00:32:48.134
of ways how limiting and how
unfortunate for the legacy of

00:32:48.134 --> 00:32:52.744
psychoanalysis this kind of
focus on a particular issue

00:32:52.744 --> 00:32:57.980
turns out to be--
this is Deleuze's critique of

00:32:57.980 --> 00:32:59.900
Freud, not mine.
 

00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:02.088
You would think that Deleuze,
then,

00:33:02.088 --> 00:33:05.096
would be a lot closer to Lacan
just for the reasons that I have

00:33:05.096 --> 00:33:11.431
just described,
but Lacan, too--at the very

00:33:11.431 --> 00:33:21.140
bottom of page 034 in your copy
center reader,

00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:25.586
on the right-hand column--he
says: "…[I]t is not

00:33:25.586 --> 00:33:29.656
surprising that psychoanalysis
tied its fate to that of

00:33:29.656 --> 00:33:34.029
linguistics…"
Now it's impossible to say--

00:33:34.029 --> 00:33:37.459
I think quite by design--it's
impossible to say whether

00:33:37.459 --> 00:33:41.078
Deleuze is referring to Freud or
Lacan in saying that,

00:33:41.078 --> 00:33:43.820
because it's Lacan who claims
that Freud said it:

00:33:43.820 --> 00:33:46.292
in other words,
that The Interpretation of

00:33:46.292 --> 00:33:49.426
Dreams is the text in which
we discover that the unconscious

00:33:49.426 --> 00:33:53.420
is structured like a language;
but at the same time,

00:33:53.420 --> 00:33:59.576
posterity has taken Lacan's
focus on linguistics to be a

00:33:59.576 --> 00:34:03.473
massive,
perhaps inappropriate revision

00:34:03.473 --> 00:34:07.220
of Freud and to be a very
different matter.

00:34:07.220 --> 00:34:12.143
So it's interesting that
Deleuze quite ambiguously seems

00:34:12.143 --> 00:34:17.333
to suppose that Freud and Lacan
are part and parcel of each

00:34:17.333 --> 00:34:18.230
other.
 

00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:23.206
The reason he can do that is
that he is interested in a form

00:34:23.206 --> 00:34:28.521
of thinking about language which
no linguistics has successfully

00:34:28.521 --> 00:34:31.960
accommodated,
as far as he's concerned.

00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:34.699
In other words,
he keeps talking about Chomsky.

00:34:34.699 --> 00:34:38.601
Chomsky seems to be,
in a way, the villain of your

00:34:38.601 --> 00:34:39.239
essay.
 

00:34:39.239 --> 00:34:42.074
But I think,
in a way, that's just a way of

00:34:42.074 --> 00:34:45.478
evading talking about Saussure,
because you wouldn't want to

00:34:45.478 --> 00:34:47.300
get in trouble with all those
structuralists;

00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:51.900
because the problem with
Saussure, too,

00:34:51.900 --> 00:34:56.353
is that there is a certain
tyranny or arboresque tendency

00:34:56.353 --> 00:35:00.650
in Saussurean thinking to be
focused on the binary--

00:35:00.650 --> 00:35:04.197
that is, the relationship
between the signified and

00:35:04.197 --> 00:35:06.742
signifier as fixed,
as inflexible,

00:35:06.742 --> 00:35:11.096
and as lacking in what Derrida
would call "free play"

00:35:11.096 --> 00:35:15.820
and therefore,
too ,a kind of tyranny.

00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:19.639
So, very quickly,
on the rhizome.

00:35:19.639 --> 00:35:26.480
How do we know a rhizome when
we see it?

00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:32.469
Whatever frustrations Deleuze's
essay puts in your path,

00:35:32.469 --> 00:35:35.599
I think probably in the long
run you're pretty clear on what

00:35:35.599 --> 00:35:38.494
a rhizome is,
but if there is any lingering

00:35:38.494 --> 00:35:40.750
doubt just think about the flu.
 

00:35:40.750 --> 00:35:47.139
There is what Deleuze calls
"rhizomatic flu."

00:35:47.139 --> 00:35:50.472
That's something we get from
other people,

00:35:50.472 --> 00:35:52.829
the circulation of disease.
 

00:35:52.829 --> 00:35:56.211
As we all come down with it
around midterm period,

00:35:56.211 --> 00:35:59.179
the circulation of disease is
rhizomatic.

00:35:59.179 --> 00:36:03.304
It's a perfect example of--to
use another instance from

00:36:03.304 --> 00:36:07.889
Deleuze--the relationship
between the wasp and the orchid.

00:36:07.889 --> 00:36:13.056
The wasp, like the virus,
sort of flits about from

00:36:13.056 --> 00:36:18.224
blossom to blossom,
descends, and then constitutes

00:36:18.224 --> 00:36:19.489
the flu.
 

00:36:19.489 --> 00:36:23.639
By contrast there is hereditary
disease--

00:36:23.639 --> 00:36:27.677
that is, that which is lurking
in us because we're programmed

00:36:27.677 --> 00:36:30.199
for it,
we're hard-wired for it,

00:36:30.199 --> 00:36:33.050
and it is genetically in our
nature.

00:36:33.050 --> 00:36:38.949
This Deleuze associates with
the arboresque.

00:36:38.949 --> 00:36:41.699
It comes from an origin.
 

00:36:41.699 --> 00:36:47.387
It is something that is a cause
within us or a cause standing

00:36:47.387 --> 00:36:51.090
behind us,
as opposed to something coming

00:36:51.090 --> 00:36:55.210
out of left field in an
arbitrary and unpredictable

00:36:55.210 --> 00:37:00.164
fashion and descending on us--
perhaps this is also not unlike

00:37:00.164 --> 00:37:04.420
Tynjanov's distinction between
modification and evolution.

00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:10.400
The arboresque evolves;
the rhizomatic is modification.

00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:17.010
The give and take of tensions
among entities--

00:37:17.010 --> 00:37:21.090
the rats tumbling over each
other, the maze of the burrow,

00:37:21.090 --> 00:37:28.085
the spreading of crabgrass--all
of this has a kind of randomness

00:37:28.085 --> 00:37:30.639
and unpredictability.
 

00:37:30.639 --> 00:37:36.753
The power of linkage at all
conceivable points without any

00:37:36.753 --> 00:37:43.190
predictability--all of this is
entailed in the rhizomatic.

00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:46.199
Now as to what's being
attacked--and again,

00:37:46.199 --> 00:37:49.699
the value system surrounding
these things is not absolute,

00:37:49.699 --> 00:37:53.769
Deleuze is not going so far as
to say "arboresque bad,

00:37:53.769 --> 00:37:55.268
rhizomatic good."
 

00:37:55.268 --> 00:37:58.619
He's coming pretty close to it,
but he acknowledges the perils,

00:37:58.619 --> 00:38:02.014
as I say, of the
rhizomatic--but in the meantime

00:38:02.014 --> 00:38:05.608
just one point in passing--
because I'm running out of time

00:38:05.608 --> 00:38:08.972
to talk about Žižek--
just one point in passing about

00:38:08.972 --> 00:38:10.110
the arboresque.
 

00:38:10.110 --> 00:38:12.635
There are actually,
in the first pages of your

00:38:12.635 --> 00:38:14.039
essay, two forms of it.
 

00:38:14.039 --> 00:38:17.771
One is what he calls the
"root book,"

00:38:17.771 --> 00:38:22.637
the traditional classical book
which presents to you a theme:

00:38:22.637 --> 00:38:26.449
"I am going to write about
so-and-so,

00:38:26.449 --> 00:38:28.699
and I'm going to do so
systematically,

00:38:28.699 --> 00:38:32.559
one thing at a time in a series
of chapters."

00:38:32.559 --> 00:38:34.179
That's the root book.
 

00:38:34.179 --> 00:38:38.617
Then there is what he calls the
"fascicle book,"

00:38:38.617 --> 00:38:42.820
a book which consists of
complicated offshoots of roots

00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:46.090
but nevertheless entailing a tap
root.

00:38:46.090 --> 00:38:49.713
This is what he associates with
Modernism, precisely,

00:38:49.713 --> 00:38:50.760
in your text.
 

00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:53.398
He says in effect:
"The fascicle book is like

00:38:53.398 --> 00:38:54.530
Joyce's Ulysses.
 

00:38:54.530 --> 00:38:57.309
Everything including the
kitchen sink is in it.

00:38:57.309 --> 00:39:00.268
It looks as though it were
totally rhizomatic,

00:39:00.268 --> 00:39:02.809
but it is, of course,
controlled by,

00:39:02.809 --> 00:39:08.579
unified by, and brought into
coherence by a single focusing

00:39:08.579 --> 00:39:14.650
authorial consciousness so that
it is not truly rhizomatic;

00:39:14.650 --> 00:39:16.260
it's a fascicle book."
 

00:39:16.260 --> 00:39:18.947
And here, now,
A Thousand Plateaus is

00:39:18.947 --> 00:39:20.949
going to be a rhizomatic book.
 

00:39:20.949 --> 00:39:25.590
So you have not just two kinds
of books in this idea but three.

00:39:25.590 --> 00:39:31.590
All right then,
very quickly about Žižek.

00:39:31.590 --> 00:39:34.829
I think he can help us
understand Lacan.

00:39:34.829 --> 00:39:38.186
I hope you agree with this in
having read it,

00:39:38.186 --> 00:39:41.695
but I think in a way,
it also takes us back to,

00:39:41.695 --> 00:39:44.900
or allows us to revisit,
Peter Brooks.

00:39:44.900 --> 00:39:48.047
The best example,
it seems to me,

00:39:48.047 --> 00:39:54.244
of the way in which the tension
of desire in narrative works for

00:39:54.244 --> 00:39:57.547
Žižek is--
although these are splendid

00:39:57.547 --> 00:40:00.619
examples and I think largely
self-explanatory--

00:40:00.619 --> 00:40:05.121
the best example is actually in
another book by Žižek called

00:40:05.121 --> 00:40:09.695
Everything You Wanted to Know
About Lacan But Were Afraid to

00:40:09.695 --> 00:40:11.320
Ask Hitchcock.
 

00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:14.369
In that book,
of course, you get a lot of

00:40:14.369 --> 00:40:17.039
attention paid to
Vertigo.

00:40:17.039 --> 00:40:20.478
Just think about Vertigo
as an instance of the kind

00:40:20.478 --> 00:40:22.590
of plot Žižek is talking
about.

00:40:22.590 --> 00:40:27.699
There is that--I've forgotten
her name--really nice woman.

00:40:27.699 --> 00:40:29.411
You remember,
the painter,

00:40:29.411 --> 00:40:33.590
and Jimmy Stewart just pays
absolutely no attention to her.

00:40:33.590 --> 00:40:34.820
She's right there.
 

00:40:34.820 --> 00:40:36.030
She's available.
 

00:40:36.030 --> 00:40:37.280
She's in love with him.
 

00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:41.775
He doesn't even see her except
as a confidante:

00:40:41.775 --> 00:40:43.730
"Oh yes,
you;

00:40:43.730 --> 00:40:46.440
I'm so glad you're here."
 

00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:52.422
But he is, on the other hand,
obsessed with a woman whose

00:40:52.422 --> 00:40:56.268
identity he can't even be sure
of.

00:40:56.268 --> 00:41:00.802
It's not just that she's
inaccessible for some reason or

00:41:00.802 --> 00:41:04.099
that she's a distant object of
desire.

00:41:04.099 --> 00:41:08.389
Her identity and the question
of whether or not she's being

00:41:08.389 --> 00:41:12.679
play-acted by somebody else
remains completely unclear--

00:41:12.679 --> 00:41:16.411
unclear for many spectators
even as they watch the ending of

00:41:16.411 --> 00:41:18.550
the film,
completely unclear.

00:41:18.550 --> 00:41:21.420
That is an obscure,
not just a distant but an

00:41:21.420 --> 00:41:23.639
obscure object of desire.
 

00:41:23.639 --> 00:41:29.219
Of course, the premise of her
inaccessibility is what drives

00:41:29.219 --> 00:41:30.260
the plot.
 

00:41:30.260 --> 00:41:34.291
Now I think that it's
interesting to think about the

00:41:34.291 --> 00:41:38.719
relationship between the element
of detour and delay,

00:41:38.719 --> 00:41:43.434
as Žižek implies it,
in understanding narrative and

00:41:43.434 --> 00:41:46.789
what Peter Brooks is talking
about.

00:41:46.789 --> 00:41:51.489
Peter Brooks is talking about
the way in which middles in

00:41:51.489 --> 00:41:55.349
plots protract themselves
through episodes,

00:41:55.349 --> 00:42:02.739
all of which manifest some sort
of imbalance or need for further

00:42:02.739 --> 00:42:05.789
repetition in a new key.
 

00:42:05.789 --> 00:42:08.684
Much of this--because the
characteristic plot of the kind

00:42:08.684 --> 00:42:11.632
of fiction Brooks is mainly
thinking about is the marriage

00:42:11.632 --> 00:42:13.639
plot--
much of this has to do with

00:42:13.639 --> 00:42:15.239
inappropriate object choice.
 

00:42:15.239 --> 00:42:18.538
That indeed can also in many
cases, à

00:42:18.538 --> 00:42:21.693
la what I began by
mentioning in Žižek,

00:42:21.693 --> 00:42:25.280
lead to inappropriate political
object choice.

00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:27.864
Think, for example,
about the plot of Henry James'

00:42:27.864 --> 00:42:30.239
Princess Casamassima in
that regard.

00:42:30.239 --> 00:42:35.452
Poor Hyacinth Robinson strikes
out on both counts in rather

00:42:35.452 --> 00:42:37.880
completely parallel ways.
 

00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:42.443
He ends up on the wrong side of
politics, and he ends up on the

00:42:42.443 --> 00:42:43.989
wrong side of love.
 

00:42:43.989 --> 00:42:48.110
In a way, the Princess
Casamassima is an

00:42:48.110 --> 00:42:52.230
exploration of these two sides
of the issue.

00:42:52.230 --> 00:42:57.721
So in any case,
for Brooks the resolution of

00:42:57.721 --> 00:43:04.489
the plot is a way in which
closure can be achieved.

00:43:04.489 --> 00:43:09.550
It is a final moment of
equilibrium,

00:43:09.550 --> 00:43:14.335
as one might say,
or quiet or reduction of

00:43:14.335 --> 00:43:18.521
excitation,
such that the Freudian death

00:43:18.521 --> 00:43:22.503
wish can be realized,
as we know, in the way we want

00:43:22.503 --> 00:43:25.661
it to be realized,
as opposed to our being

00:43:25.661 --> 00:43:29.050
afflicted by something from the
outside.

00:43:29.050 --> 00:43:32.061
So in Brooks,
whose closest ties are to

00:43:32.061 --> 00:43:35.969
structuralism,
there is an achieved sense of

00:43:35.969 --> 00:43:41.088
closure which is an important
aspect of what's admirable in

00:43:41.088 --> 00:43:42.059
fiction.
 

00:43:42.059 --> 00:43:45.079
Žižek is more postmodern.
 

00:43:45.079 --> 00:43:48.164
Žižek sees,
following Lacan,

00:43:48.164 --> 00:43:53.909
the object of desire as
asymptotic, as being ultimately

00:43:53.909 --> 00:43:58.748
and always inaccessible;
or if it becomes

00:43:58.748 --> 00:44:01.277
accessible--
as, for example,

00:44:01.277 --> 00:44:04.969
on page 1193 in the right-hand
column--

00:44:04.969 --> 00:44:07.599
or one might say,
almost accessible,

00:44:07.599 --> 00:44:11.735
this gives rise to as many
problems as it seems to

00:44:11.735 --> 00:44:12.750
eliminate.
 

00:44:12.750 --> 00:44:16.695
At the bottom right-hand
column, page 1193,

00:44:16.695 --> 00:44:19.391
Å½iÅ¾ek says:
… [P]erhaps,

00:44:19.391 --> 00:44:23.170
in courtly love itself,
the long-awaited moment of

00:44:23.170 --> 00:44:26.574
highest fulfillment,
when the Lady renders

00:44:26.574 --> 00:44:30.025
Gnada,
mercy, to her servant is not

00:44:30.025 --> 00:44:34.317
the Lady's surrender,
her consent to the sexual act,

00:44:34.317 --> 00:44:37.539
nor some mysterious rite of
initiation,

00:44:37.539 --> 00:44:41.920
but simply a sign of love on
the part of the Lady,

00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:44.820
the "miracle"
that the Object answered,

00:44:44.820 --> 00:44:48.010
stretching its hand out towards
the supplicant.

00:44:48.010 --> 00:44:51.929
The object, in other words,
has become subject.

00:44:51.929 --> 00:44:56.820
In this moment of exchange,
mutuality of recognition,

00:44:56.820 --> 00:45:00.750
or becoming human on the part
of the lady--

00:45:00.750 --> 00:45:05.795
whom of course Žižek has
associated with the dominatrix

00:45:05.795 --> 00:45:11.170
in a sadistic relationship--
in this moment of becoming

00:45:11.170 --> 00:45:16.476
human and of offering love,
the object becomes more

00:45:16.476 --> 00:45:17.690
accessible.
 

00:45:17.690 --> 00:45:20.884
That is to say,
there is now the possibility of

00:45:20.884 --> 00:45:23.889
some form of mutuality,
but in her becoming more

00:45:23.889 --> 00:45:27.666
accessible,
the energy of desire is

00:45:27.666 --> 00:45:31.610
threatened with dissolution.
 

00:45:31.610 --> 00:45:35.722
In other words,
closure in Žižek is a threat

00:45:35.722 --> 00:45:38.099
to the energy of desire.
 

00:45:38.099 --> 00:45:42.670
Desire is something which
inheres in our very language,

00:45:42.670 --> 00:45:48.170
according to Žižek,
and which, were it to be

00:45:48.170 --> 00:45:52.570
understood as brought to
closure,

00:45:52.570 --> 00:45:58.599
the lady--Žižek gives lots of
examples of the lady,

00:45:58.599 --> 00:46:01.739
after all of this sort of
seeming inaccessibility--

00:46:01.739 --> 00:46:03.519
the lady says,
"Sure, why not?

00:46:03.519 --> 00:46:06.619
Of course."
 

00:46:06.619 --> 00:46:12.780
The person is completely upset
and then refuses the act because

00:46:12.780 --> 00:46:16.059
there's nothing more to desire.
 

00:46:16.059 --> 00:46:19.577
All of a sudden,
the whole structure of that

00:46:19.577 --> 00:46:24.650
energy that drives language and
consciousness comes tumbling to

00:46:24.650 --> 00:46:28.170
the ground, and desire has
become need.

00:46:28.170 --> 00:46:34.056
It's become merely a matter of
gratification through what's

00:46:34.056 --> 00:46:40.449
ready-to-hand and no longer a
question of sustaining a dream.

00:46:40.449 --> 00:46:45.121
This, generally speaking,
is what Žižek wants to focus

00:46:45.121 --> 00:46:48.010
on in talking about these plots.
 

00:46:48.010 --> 00:46:52.704
The object of desire must be
not just distant but also

00:46:52.704 --> 00:46:53.590
obscure.
 

00:46:53.590 --> 00:46:55.099
I'm going to make two more
points.

00:46:55.099 --> 00:46:58.029
First of all,
as you can no doubt tell,

00:46:58.029 --> 00:47:01.806
this is a perfect replica of
Hans Holbein's The

00:47:01.806 --> 00:47:03.039
Ambassadors.
 

00:47:03.039 --> 00:47:07.427
I'd be amazed if anyone in
the room hadn't recognized it,

00:47:07.427 --> 00:47:09.329
&gt;
 

00:47:09.329 --> 00:47:11.380
but there it is.
 

00:47:11.380 --> 00:47:12.784
[Gestures to drawing on the
board.]

00:47:12.784 --> 00:47:13.570
There's two guys.
 

00:47:13.570 --> 00:47:15.150
There's a table between them.
 

00:47:15.150 --> 00:47:20.217
They are negotiating probably
over one of Henry the Eighth's

00:47:20.217 --> 00:47:24.599
marriages, and this I think is
not insignificant.

00:47:24.599 --> 00:47:29.260
They are there in the service
of Henry the Eighth negotiating

00:47:29.260 --> 00:47:32.989
one of those extremely
complicated marriages,

00:47:32.989 --> 00:47:38.103
possibly even the one that led
to the abdication of the

00:47:38.103 --> 00:47:42.840
Anglican Church from the Roman
Catholic Church--

00:47:42.840 --> 00:47:44.530
who knows?
 

00:47:44.530 --> 00:47:49.090
But the lore about the painting
is that it has to do with the

00:47:49.090 --> 00:47:53.193
negotiation for an object of
desire, and that object is

00:47:53.193 --> 00:47:54.030
absent.
 

00:47:54.030 --> 00:47:55.864
In other words,
it's something really only

00:47:55.864 --> 00:47:57.030
implied by the painting.
 

00:47:57.030 --> 00:48:00.862
In the foreground of the
painting, notorious to art

00:48:00.862 --> 00:48:03.469
historians, there is this thing.
 

00:48:03.469 --> 00:48:05.300
[Gestures to drawing on the
board.]

00:48:05.300 --> 00:48:07.940
Now this is pretty much what's
in the painting.

00:48:07.940 --> 00:48:11.929
This is not a replica of the
two guys standing there,

00:48:11.929 --> 00:48:14.376
granted but this is
pretty much what you see when

00:48:14.376 --> 00:48:16.380
you look at the foreground of
the painting.

00:48:16.380 --> 00:48:20.452
If you look sort of from the
side, it turns into something

00:48:20.452 --> 00:48:22.239
very much like a skull.
 

00:48:22.239 --> 00:48:26.123
Generally speaking,
there's a kind of consensus

00:48:26.123 --> 00:48:31.021
among scholars that it may be a
weirdly distorted shadow or

00:48:31.021 --> 00:48:35.260
representation of a skull,
although what a skull is doing

00:48:35.260 --> 00:48:38.686
in the foreground,
of course, causes us to wonder

00:48:38.686 --> 00:48:39.389
as well.
 

00:48:39.389 --> 00:48:42.170
Obviously, you can have some
ideas on the subject,

00:48:42.170 --> 00:48:45.615
but it's still not exactly
realist painting we're talking

00:48:45.615 --> 00:48:48.510
about if he sticks a skull in
the foreground.

00:48:48.510 --> 00:48:51.938
Well, it also has a certain
resemblance to other things we

00:48:51.938 --> 00:48:54.583
could mention,
but the main point about it is

00:48:54.583 --> 00:48:57.050
that we don't really know what
it is.

00:48:57.050 --> 00:49:00.807
It is, in other words,
something we've already become

00:49:00.807 --> 00:49:03.699
familiar with in thinking about
Lacan.

00:49:03.699 --> 00:49:09.059
It is that signifier,
that ultimate signifier,

00:49:09.059 --> 00:49:14.221
which is the obscure object of
desire called sometimes by Lacan

00:49:14.221 --> 00:49:18.798
"the phallus,"
and it seems simply to be there

00:49:18.798 --> 00:49:21.380
before us in this painting.
 

00:49:21.380 --> 00:49:24.059
Now both in the book on
Hitchcock,

00:49:24.059 --> 00:49:28.356
where he finds something like
this in just about every film

00:49:28.356 --> 00:49:33.525
Hitchcock ever made,
and also in Holbein's painting,

00:49:33.525 --> 00:49:38.110
Žižek calls this "the
blot."

00:49:38.110 --> 00:49:40.159
We have nothing else to call it.
 

00:49:40.159 --> 00:49:40.960
It's a blot.
 

00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:41.679
What's it doing there?
 

00:49:41.679 --> 00:49:44.980
In fiction, we would call it
irrelevant detail.

00:49:44.980 --> 00:49:50.992
We can find a way of placing
formally absolutely everything

00:49:50.992 --> 00:49:52.340
in fiction.
 

00:49:52.340 --> 00:49:54.500
The weather,
the flowers on the table,

00:49:54.500 --> 00:49:57.440
whatever it might be:
we can place these formally,

00:49:57.440 --> 00:50:01.079
but there may be something in
fiction which is simply

00:50:01.079 --> 00:50:02.199
unaccountable.
 

00:50:02.199 --> 00:50:06.925
We cannot account for it,
and that's the blot for

00:50:06.925 --> 00:50:07.909
Žižek.
 

00:50:07.909 --> 00:50:08.849
All right.
 

00:50:08.849 --> 00:50:11.268
Now finally,
on desire on language:

00:50:11.268 --> 00:50:15.463
there's a part of Žižek's
essay which you may have thought

00:50:15.463 --> 00:50:17.099
of as a digression.
 

00:50:17.099 --> 00:50:20.335
He's suddenly talking about
J.L. Austin's ordinary

00:50:20.335 --> 00:50:21.920
language philosophy.
 

00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:25.911
He's suddenly talking about the
linguist Ducrot's idea of

00:50:25.911 --> 00:50:26.909
predication.
 

00:50:26.909 --> 00:50:33.869
What's important about,
in the one case,

00:50:33.869 --> 00:50:38.369
the element of performance in
any utterance and,

00:50:38.369 --> 00:50:41.431
in the other case,
the dominance of an entire

00:50:41.431 --> 00:50:45.195
sentence by predication--
what's important in both of

00:50:45.195 --> 00:50:49.456
those elements is that they take
over an aspect of language of

00:50:49.456 --> 00:50:52.670
which they were only supposed to
be a part.

00:50:52.670 --> 00:50:54.751
In other words,
in Austin there are both

00:50:54.751 --> 00:50:57.472
performatives and constatives;
but in the long run,

00:50:57.472 --> 00:51:00.407
the argument of How to Do
Things with Words suggests

00:51:00.407 --> 00:51:02.077
that there are only
performatives:

00:51:02.077 --> 00:51:04.000
I thought this was a
constative,

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:05.253
he says in effect,
I thought this was just

00:51:05.253 --> 00:51:07.784
straightforward language,
but I can now see an element of

00:51:07.784 --> 00:51:08.809
performance in it.
 

00:51:08.809 --> 00:51:13.456
That's the way that there's a
gradual changing of his own mind

00:51:13.456 --> 00:51:17.190
in Austin's book to which
Žižek is sensitive.

00:51:17.190 --> 00:51:20.206
By the same token,
Ducrot talks about the way in

00:51:20.206 --> 00:51:23.030
which the predicate element of a
subject,

00:51:23.030 --> 00:51:27.887
the predicate relation,
has a kind of energy of agency

00:51:27.887 --> 00:51:32.378
that simply takes over the
grammatical subject and

00:51:32.378 --> 00:51:37.420
constitutes a kind of
performance in the sentence--

00:51:37.420 --> 00:51:41.039
performance in both cases
meaning "desire."

00:51:41.039 --> 00:51:45.563
When I promise to do something,
I also desire to fulfill the

00:51:45.563 --> 00:51:46.329
promise.
 

00:51:46.329 --> 00:51:51.342
When I predicate something,
I'm also evoking a desire that

00:51:51.342 --> 00:51:55.650
that something be the case
possibly through my own

00:51:55.650 --> 00:51:57.409
instrumentality.
 

00:51:57.409 --> 00:51:58.389
This is the argument.
 

00:51:58.389 --> 00:52:02.402
That's what Žižek means by
"desire in language,"

00:52:02.402 --> 00:52:05.599
by the inescapability of desire
in language,

00:52:05.599 --> 00:52:08.793
and the way in which it
permeates everything we can say

00:52:08.793 --> 00:52:11.434
to each other--
most particularly,

00:52:11.434 --> 00:52:15.429
the way in which it permeates
the plot or,

00:52:15.429 --> 00:52:18.789
as they say in film studies,
the "diegesis"

00:52:18.789 --> 00:52:22.280
of the kinds of film examples
that Žižek gives us.

00:52:22.280 --> 00:52:24.170
I'd better stop there.
 

00:52:24.170 --> 00:52:28.483
I hope that this somewhat
rapid-fire survey of some key

00:52:28.483 --> 00:52:31.280
ideas in these texts are
helpful.

00:52:31.280 --> 00:52:33.340
I think in the long run
perhaps, I hope,

00:52:33.340 --> 00:52:38.068
mainly that you see these two
energetic authors as exemplars

00:52:38.068 --> 00:52:42.639
of what we call Postmodernism
and see the relevance of the

00:52:42.639 --> 00:52:47.610
concept of the postmodern to the
study of literary theory.

00:52:47.610 --> 00:52:48.849
Thanks.

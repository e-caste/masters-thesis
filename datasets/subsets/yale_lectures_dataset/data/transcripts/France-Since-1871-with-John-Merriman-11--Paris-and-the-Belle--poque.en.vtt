00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:04.255
Professor John Merriman:
Okay, today we're going to

00:00:04.255 --> 00:00:06.565
talk about Paris.
And in order to talk about

00:00:06.565 --> 00:00:08.980
Paris in the Belle
Époque--and the Belle

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:11.920
Époque was not good for
most people in France,

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.587
as we heard before,
but the image of that nostalgia

00:00:15.587 --> 00:00:20.282
infused a vision of Paris in the
Belle Époque is something

00:00:20.282 --> 00:00:23.510
that of course comes--really is
created,

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:26.970
it's imagined,
after World War I.

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.954
But in order to understand sort
of the cultural,

00:00:29.954 --> 00:00:31.860
and economic,
and political,

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:36.148
and social dimensions of fin de
siècle of Paris,

00:00:36.148 --> 00:00:40.912
we have to back up and look at
the rebuilding of Paris in the

00:00:40.912 --> 00:00:45.360
1850s and '60s by that man
dissed by my late friend,

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.050
Richard Cobb,
as the Alsatian Attila,

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.087
that is Baron Haussmann,
whose name I should've written

00:00:52.087 --> 00:00:57.484
on the board but didn't.
Some of you already know about

00:00:57.484 --> 00:01:02.109
him, but it's h-a-u-s-s-m-a-n-n,
Georges.

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:07.227
And he only went back to Paris
three times after he left in

00:01:07.227 --> 00:01:11.110
financial scandal at the end of
the 1860s.

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.744
And he lives until the early
1890s, but the great boulevards

00:01:15.744 --> 00:01:20.300
that became identified with
modern Paris and on which Emile

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.109
Henry went on this little walk,
going out to kill,

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:27.405
have to be seen in the context
of the rebuilding of Paris

00:01:27.405 --> 00:01:30.946
during that period.
And it was the largest urban

00:01:30.946 --> 00:01:33.513
renewal project in,
at that time,

00:01:33.513 --> 00:01:37.352
in the history of cities.
Really, the only ones

00:01:37.352 --> 00:01:41.296
comparable were the rebuilding
of Edo, that is Tokyo,

00:01:41.296 --> 00:01:44.861
after the Great Fire,
and London, at the time of

00:01:44.861 --> 00:01:49.346
Christopher Wren.
So, we back up even further to

00:01:49.346 --> 00:01:53.947
look at Paris in 1837,
just to give you a sense of

00:01:53.947 --> 00:01:57.576
what changed.
And the first thing you notice,

00:01:57.576 --> 00:02:01.007
particularly if you're
comparing it to London or to

00:02:01.007 --> 00:02:05.329
Berlin, is how small Paris was
and how small Paris still is.

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:08.352
This is pre-1860,
so it's before the inner

00:02:08.352 --> 00:02:12.038
suburbs were annexed,
which included Montmartre out

00:02:12.038 --> 00:02:15.430
there, and Auteuil,
and all of the others.

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.592
And those of you who've been to
Paris or know about Paris will

00:02:18.592 --> 00:02:20.509
see the Jardin de Luxembourg
there,

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:23.523
which was very,
very close to the city limits

00:02:23.523 --> 00:02:25.851
at that time,
and then there is the

00:02:25.851 --> 00:02:29.043
Tuileries,
and then the edge of Paris

00:02:29.043 --> 00:02:34.025
there, the Arc de Triomphe,
which was begun by Napoleon and

00:02:34.025 --> 00:02:37.289
completed during the July
Monarchy.

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:41.709
So Paris, a tremendously
overcrowded place--and the most

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:46.369
densely populated parts of Paris
until mid-century were the

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:51.947
Île of Cité,
that is the Island of Cite,

00:02:51.947 --> 00:02:54.575
c-i-t-e;
there's Notre Dame,

00:02:54.575 --> 00:02:56.771
and the Marais,
m-a-r-a-i-s,

00:02:56.771 --> 00:03:00.349
the sort of central Right Bank
districts;

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:06.280
and their population density is
three times what it is today.

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:12.426
And, so, the population of
Paris, which grows so rapidly,

00:03:12.426 --> 00:03:18.114
in 1851 is 1,053,000 people;
1861, a year after the

00:03:18.114 --> 00:03:23.229
annexation of the inner suburbs,
is 1,696,000;

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:27.317
1872 after the Commune
1,825,000, minus the 25,000

00:03:27.317 --> 00:03:31.071
people slaughtered in the wake
of the Commune,

00:03:31.071 --> 00:03:34.854
during bloody week;
1881,2,269,00,

00:03:34.854 --> 00:03:40.979
and 1896 about two and a half
million people.

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:45.147
And, so, European cities only
grow basically in the first

00:03:45.147 --> 00:03:49.389
two-thirds of the nineteenth
century through migration,

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:53.310
because more people die in
cities than are born there--why?

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.783
Because of unhealthy
quartersâ€¦

00:03:55.783 --> 00:03:58.601
The life expectancy in Lille,
for example,

00:03:58.601 --> 00:04:02.930
was about nineteen-years-old,
the same thing in Manchester.

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.680
That includes infant mortality,
so that's a little bit skewed;

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.789
but, still, cities are
unhealthy places.

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:14.877
Old people, the miserably poor
people also go to Paris to try

00:04:14.877 --> 00:04:18.269
to find charity and ultimately
to die.

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:21.126
Child abandonment,
infanticide and all the things

00:04:21.126 --> 00:04:23.209
that I mentioned
before--disease,

00:04:23.209 --> 00:04:28.276
the cholera disease rips
through Paris in 1832 and 1849,

00:04:28.276 --> 00:04:31.065
again in 1884.
So, basically cities,

00:04:31.065 --> 00:04:33.884
large cities replenish
themselves only through

00:04:33.884 --> 00:04:37.329
immigration, through much of the
nineteenth century.

00:04:37.329 --> 00:04:40.721
And, so, what happens is you've
got this sort of super,

00:04:40.721 --> 00:04:44.238
hyper overcrowding of the
central districts as immigrants

00:04:44.238 --> 00:04:47.270
from the north of France,
from Normandy,

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:52.026
from the east of France,
also seasonal migrants from the

00:04:52.026 --> 00:04:56.955
Limousine who finally settle
Paris pour into these central

00:04:56.955 --> 00:05:02.490
districts and then gradually
head for the edge of the city.

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:08.309
It's not until the 1880s that
you have the huge wave of Breton

00:05:08.309 --> 00:05:12.541
migration from Brittany;
and it's not just to Paris,

00:05:12.541 --> 00:05:15.980
also, but that comes later than
we're talking about.

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:21.079
So, you've got your basic,
extraordinarily crowded city,

00:05:21.079 --> 00:05:25.066
the ranks of the poor,
above all, swollen by

00:05:25.066 --> 00:05:27.217
immigration.
The difference,

00:05:27.217 --> 00:05:30.019
one of the differences between
the nineteenth century and now,

00:05:30.019 --> 00:05:32.365
for example,
is in the nineteenth century

00:05:32.365 --> 00:05:36.000
most people, the people coming
into Paris were already poor,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.110
were poorer than the people who
were already there.

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:41.587
Now, in the 1950s and 1960s
that changes,

00:05:41.587 --> 00:05:44.634
the 1950s and 1960s.
You have les jeunes

00:05:44.634 --> 00:05:46.850
couples, you have young
married couples,

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:49.498
upwardly mobile,
who come to Paris with enough

00:05:49.498 --> 00:05:53.006
money that they've put together
to rent and then finally maybe

00:05:53.006 --> 00:05:56.050
to buy an apartment,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:00.401
But you have a mass of poor
people, masses of poor people

00:06:00.401 --> 00:06:03.819
coming into Paris,
and Paris is unhealthy.

00:06:03.819 --> 00:06:05.858
This I put in,
this is rien à

00:06:05.858 --> 00:06:08.164
voir avec,
but this is--I've said before

00:06:08.164 --> 00:06:11.007
about how you just try to
imagine what things are like

00:06:11.007 --> 00:06:14.064
until you can see actually for
the first time--this is the

00:06:14.064 --> 00:06:17.050
first photo of Paris.
This is a daguerreotype;

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:18.560
it was a primitive kind of
photo.

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:24.998
You can identify this as the
Rue--as the Faubourg du Temple

00:06:24.998 --> 00:06:29.550
on the edge of Paris,
and this is 1837.

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:34.617
But here is your classic sort
of image of urban poverty,

00:06:34.617 --> 00:06:38.487
urban squalor,
the kind of grey images of a

00:06:38.487 --> 00:06:43.093
street that no longer exists
because of Haussmann's

00:06:43.093 --> 00:06:46.037
rebuilding.
This is behind the

00:06:46.037 --> 00:06:49.557
Panthéon,
that is just sort of above the

00:06:49.557 --> 00:06:52.923
Latin Quarter,
and you see this ditch running

00:06:52.923 --> 00:06:56.310
right down the street.
It carried sewage.

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:58.513
There were already sewers in
Paris, but it was terribly

00:06:58.513 --> 00:07:00.794
unhealthy--and you're thinking,
"oh, why?"--he says,

00:07:00.794 --> 00:07:02.897
"it's so crowded but where are
all the people,

00:07:02.897 --> 00:07:04.720
it looks like there's nobody
there."

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.846
Well, in fact it's because it
took so long to expose photos

00:07:07.846 --> 00:07:11.350
that they're--as you look very
closely you can see some people.

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:14.430
But another reason why there
are not a lot of people about or

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:17.459
any signs of life is that this
has already been targeted for

00:07:17.459 --> 00:07:20.388
demolition,
and the people have had to move

00:07:20.388 --> 00:07:24.426
out of what was already a poor
neighborhood to find an even

00:07:24.426 --> 00:07:27.420
poorer one on the margins of
urban life.

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:30.569
That was a photograph by
Charles Melville.

00:07:30.569 --> 00:07:34.818
And here we got the Louis
Napoleon, your basic picture of

00:07:34.818 --> 00:07:37.853
Louis Napoleon,
for once not at the opera

00:07:37.853 --> 00:07:41.040
trying to hit on the young
ballerinas,

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:44.638
and the man in the middle is
Haussmann, who was not born in

00:07:44.638 --> 00:07:48.237
Alsace, but his family came from
Alsace and he'd been a law

00:07:48.237 --> 00:07:51.031
student in Paris,
and he was born in the more

00:07:51.031 --> 00:07:52.910
prosperous western part of
Paris.

00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:57.115
Again, that dichotomy between
prosperous west and more

00:07:57.115 --> 00:08:00.924
impoverished east is as
important as increasingly

00:08:00.924 --> 00:08:04.522
prosperous center,
over the long run of time,

00:08:04.522 --> 00:08:08.870
and the impoverished periphery,
more about that in a minute.

00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:14.154
So, in 1852 Napoleon spreads
out a map of a city he really

00:08:14.154 --> 00:08:17.312
didn't know very well,
Napoleon III does,

00:08:17.312 --> 00:08:20.060
and says, "I want you to build
me great boulevards."

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:22.621
And, so, Haussmann,
who's prefect of the Seine,

00:08:22.621 --> 00:08:25.025
does that.
And it's a time when the

00:08:25.025 --> 00:08:28.279
wealthy got wealthier and the
poor did better,

00:08:28.279 --> 00:08:30.810
working class people did
better,

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:35.379
but the gap between the rich
and the poor increased.

00:08:35.379 --> 00:08:39.545
So, now, if you're looking
later, in 1855 you see that the

00:08:39.545 --> 00:08:44.002
city had expanded but you still
have the wall around Paris and

00:08:44.002 --> 00:08:48.460
you still have these sort of
rural areas within the city.

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:51.322
And one of the points of this
is that there's a continuing

00:08:51.322 --> 00:08:53.179
implosion of population into
Paris,

00:08:53.179 --> 00:08:56.610
and the eviction by high prices
and by demolition,

00:08:56.610 --> 00:09:00.577
with the rebuilding of Paris,
is going to push people out

00:09:00.577 --> 00:09:02.840
into the working class
periphery.

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:04.565
Belleville, which I talked
about before,

00:09:04.565 --> 00:09:07.086
that's where Emile Henry says
"it's war between you and me

00:09:07.086 --> 00:09:09.529
now, baby";
La Villette;

00:09:09.529 --> 00:09:14.917
Montmartre here,
which was indeed still at this

00:09:14.917 --> 00:09:19.251
time fairly rural.
Oh well, you have to just all

00:09:19.251 --> 00:09:22.891
move your heads to see,
this is not a very interesting

00:09:22.891 --> 00:09:26.358
photo,
but--or it's not hardly a

00:09:26.358 --> 00:09:32.398
photo, but just to see the
difference between 1850 and

00:09:32.398 --> 00:09:36.059
1900,
the growth of the suburbs.

00:09:36.059 --> 00:09:41.870
And so this all involved the
demolition of great hills.

00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:47.398
This was a hill at Trocadero,
which is right on the Seine,

00:09:47.398 --> 00:09:53.411
and it put tens of thousands of
workers--gave them something to

00:09:53.411 --> 00:09:55.948
do.
Now, the principle of this,

00:09:55.948 --> 00:09:59.457
of the planning itself,
and this impacts this course

00:09:59.457 --> 00:10:03.882
and the Paris of this course,
is really built upon classical

00:10:03.882 --> 00:10:07.289
principles associated with
absolute monarchs;

00:10:07.289 --> 00:10:10.761
and I call it the imperialism
of the straight line,

00:10:10.761 --> 00:10:13.400
in that if you think of a city
like St.

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:17.219
Petersburg, built by Peter the
Great, or if you think of

00:10:17.219 --> 00:10:21.008
Madrid, built by Phillip II,
or you think of Berlin and

00:10:21.008 --> 00:10:23.700
Frederick the Great,
or you think of Versailles,

00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:28.320
a rather prosperous suburb,
they were power alleys down

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:32.301
which you marched troops,
and very different than the

00:10:32.301 --> 00:10:36.139
kind of organic city that had
grown up from medieval origins,

00:10:36.139 --> 00:10:38.544
a city like Strasbourg or,
for that matter,

00:10:38.544 --> 00:10:41.635
Lyon, though Lyon has some
classical touches too in the

00:10:41.635 --> 00:10:43.710
Place Bellecour,
and all of that.

00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:46.179
But here, just to give you an
obvious and almost banal

00:10:46.179 --> 00:10:48.835
example, but I chose it because
you already know about the

00:10:48.835 --> 00:10:51.993
Avenue of the Opéra,
for reasons we talked about

00:10:51.993 --> 00:10:55.482
before, is that this is pure
imperialism with a straight

00:10:55.482 --> 00:10:56.114
line.
The

00:10:56.114 --> 00:10:57.935
problématique,
or the question,

00:10:57.935 --> 00:11:00.419
is how you get--you're going to
build this big boulevard,

00:11:00.419 --> 00:11:04.036
how do you get from the Seine,
basically--here's the Rue de

00:11:04.036 --> 00:11:07.439
Rivoli paralleling the Seine,
to where you're going to build

00:11:07.439 --> 00:11:09.840
this new, magnificent opera that
you saw before?

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:12.114
Well, you don't have to be an
architectural genius,

00:11:12.114 --> 00:11:13.980
or Vincent Scully or someone
like that,

00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:16.831
you simply take a ruler and
then you tip off your friends

00:11:16.831 --> 00:11:18.919
about where the building's going
to go,

00:11:18.919 --> 00:11:21.624
so they make a lot of money,
and that's what Haussmann did,

00:11:21.624 --> 00:11:23.909
and then you plan the Avenue de
l'Opéra.

00:11:23.909 --> 00:11:28.179
And there are three reasons,
three, why Paris is rebuilt.

00:11:28.179 --> 00:11:31.443
First, to bring more light and
air to Paris,

00:11:31.443 --> 00:11:35.769
to make it a healthier
place--more sewers and all that;

00:11:35.769 --> 00:11:40.921
second, to free the flow of
capital, for capital,

00:11:40.921 --> 00:11:44.625
to help business.
It's not a coincidence that the

00:11:44.625 --> 00:11:47.901
big department stores that grow
up in the '50s and '60s are on

00:11:47.901 --> 00:11:51.230
the grands boulevards,
are on the big boulevards;

00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:54.845
and third, and I've alluded to
this before, how do you build a

00:11:54.845 --> 00:11:56.980
barricade across a huge
boulevard,

00:11:56.980 --> 00:11:59.919
how do you build a barricade
across the Avenue de

00:11:59.919 --> 00:12:03.177
l'Opéra?
The first barricades in Paris

00:12:03.177 --> 00:12:05.929
were in the late sixteenth
century.

00:12:05.929 --> 00:12:08.453
You know about the barricades,
at least some of you do anyway,

00:12:08.453 --> 00:12:11.051
of the French Revolution.
There are more barricades in

00:12:11.051 --> 00:12:13.220
1830, there are more barricades
in 1851.

00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:16.720
You've seen photos of
barricades from 1871.

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:20.637
And Haussmann says this in his
memoirs, "we want to create

00:12:20.637 --> 00:12:24.165
barricade-proof boulevards."
In World War II,

00:12:24.165 --> 00:12:28.471
in August of 1944,
the barricades that are built

00:12:28.471 --> 00:12:33.693
against the German troops are
built in neighborhoods often

00:12:33.693 --> 00:12:39.259
where you have narrow streets.
And in 1968 it's the same thing.

00:12:39.259 --> 00:12:43.044
It was very hard to build a
barricade across the Boulevard

00:12:43.044 --> 00:12:45.389
Saint-Michel.
So, that's the first thing.

00:12:45.389 --> 00:12:50.426
And then you imagine you're
looking down--you're looking at

00:12:50.426 --> 00:12:54.186
Garnier's Opera,
which is going to rise out of

00:12:54.186 --> 00:12:58.808
the ground, the most expensive
building built in Paris to that

00:12:58.808 --> 00:13:00.981
point,
and then these houses,

00:13:00.981 --> 00:13:04.304
which were actually fairly
middle class buildings,

00:13:04.304 --> 00:13:07.610
have to be demolished.
So, you are in--you were

00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:10.831
sitting in a bulldozer looking
through the smoke,

00:13:10.831 --> 00:13:14.120
and then there is Garnier's
Opera being built,

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:19.190
and there is Garnier's Opera,
right here.

00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:21.608
And, of course,
that square now contains

00:13:21.608 --> 00:13:25.454
probably the largest population
of pickpockets this side of the

00:13:25.454 --> 00:13:28.989
Spanish steps as American
tourists get off the metro there

00:13:28.989 --> 00:13:32.587
looking for American Express
with their wallets about to be

00:13:32.587 --> 00:13:36.219
soon to disappear.
But, and here you can look down

00:13:36.219 --> 00:13:40.257
and see--this is reversed but it
doesn't make the slightest bit

00:13:40.257 --> 00:13:44.230
of difference--you can see
that's the Place Vendôme,

00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:50.625
the column of which was brought
down in 1871 at Courbet's

00:13:50.625 --> 00:13:54.241
suggestion.
And, so, you end up with this,

00:13:54.241 --> 00:13:57.510
which you've already seen
before, the Avenue de

00:13:57.510 --> 00:14:00.166
l'Opéra,
and it was down here,

00:14:00.166 --> 00:14:04.164
the first bomb that Emile Henry
placed was down here at number

00:14:04.164 --> 00:14:06.656
eleven.
And, so, this is again a photo

00:14:06.656 --> 00:14:09.746
from 1900.
So, this is basically--there

00:14:09.746 --> 00:14:12.940
are a few automobiles racing
around;

00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:14.981
they're not racing,
the speed limit was three miles

00:14:14.981 --> 00:14:17.138
an hour;
but now, of course,

00:14:17.138 --> 00:14:21.370
you're a dead duck if you try
to cross there.

00:14:21.370 --> 00:14:23.798
There was somebody,
some general who was arrested,

00:14:23.798 --> 00:14:25.830
some scandal and he just had
testified,

00:14:25.830 --> 00:14:27.862
and then he wasn't thinking,
and he walked out into the

00:14:27.862 --> 00:14:29.179
street and was run over by a
bus.

00:14:29.179 --> 00:14:31.240
So, you really kind of have to
watch it there.

00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:34.470
But here's your pure sort of
Haussmann vista of Paris.

00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:36.977
And, of course,
the balconies,

00:14:36.977 --> 00:14:42.424
the sort of ornate balconies of
the Third Republic are something

00:14:42.424 --> 00:14:47.440
that one identifies with the
grandeur of modern Paris,

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:48.899
the Paris of the Belle
Époque.

00:14:48.899 --> 00:14:52.479
Now, what about the people who
were chased from the central

00:14:52.479 --> 00:14:54.564
districts?
This is not a very interesting

00:14:54.564 --> 00:14:57.210
print, but it's still--it was
sympathetic to those people.

00:14:57.210 --> 00:14:59.923
Most people didn't own
apartments, they rented,

00:14:59.923 --> 00:15:03.168
and if you were kicked out of
your apartment in order to

00:15:03.168 --> 00:15:06.000
facilitate the building of these
boulevards,

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.600
you were given the equivalent
of about a day's wages and that

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:11.820
was it.
And here you have--this is part

00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:14.749
two, these are two lithographs,
and the first is called

00:15:14.749 --> 00:15:17.840
Haussmannization of--that
is the bulldozing of,

00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:21.293
the Haussmannization of
Paris, part one,

00:15:21.293 --> 00:15:25.949
where you see these people and
they've got everything that they

00:15:25.949 --> 00:15:30.830
have--they got their dog and
it's a sympathetic look at them;

00:15:30.830 --> 00:15:34.801
and this is part two,
and this is a pure Haussmann

00:15:34.801 --> 00:15:36.551
vista.
This is very near the

00:15:36.551 --> 00:15:38.333
Opéra,
this is the Church of

00:15:38.333 --> 00:15:40.273
Saint-Augustine,
which I think is just

00:15:40.273 --> 00:15:43.328
god-awful,
but here again you have again

00:15:43.328 --> 00:15:46.299
the imperialism of the straight
line.

00:15:46.299 --> 00:15:49.502
And this is the big commercial
district, this is where the big

00:15:49.502 --> 00:15:51.340
department stores are near
there,

00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:55.240
like the Gallery Lafayette,
and at this time the Grand

00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:58.919
Magasin d'Louvre,
and all these sorts of things.

00:15:58.919 --> 00:16:03.430
So that's what--that's the
principle of Haussmann.

00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:04.310
Well, you can hardly see that.

00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:25.210
So, if you were a bird flying
around up here then,

00:16:25.210 --> 00:16:28.762
or if you're in a balloon and
you're seeing the results of

00:16:28.762 --> 00:16:31.629
Haussmann, here again you've got
Notre Dame,

00:16:31.629 --> 00:16:34.540
which goes from the most
populated part of Paris,

00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:37.693
along with the Marais,
to the least populated part of

00:16:37.693 --> 00:16:39.279
Paris.
Why?

00:16:39.279 --> 00:16:42.883
And we talk a lot about the
State, but these state buildings

00:16:42.883 --> 00:16:46.401
or state constructions,
including the big hospital,

00:16:46.401 --> 00:16:50.163
Hotel Dieu, or the Prefecture
of Police are built on

00:16:50.163 --> 00:16:53.850
Cité,
and so the population departs.

00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:55.961
This over here is the Church of
Saint-Sulpice,

00:16:55.961 --> 00:16:57.649
which had one of the great
organs,

00:16:57.649 --> 00:17:01.674
and here this is the famous
market of Les Halles which was

00:17:01.674 --> 00:17:05.769
built at this time next to the
Church of Saint-Eustache,

00:17:05.769 --> 00:17:09.834
and it lasted until 1972,
and they wouldn't--and they

00:17:09.834 --> 00:17:14.680
tore them all down and built
this sort of miserable failure,

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:18.976
three floors of crummy
electronics stores,

00:17:18.976 --> 00:17:25.263
and they didn't even leave one
so people--I sound like Scully

00:17:25.263 --> 00:17:28.548
but it's true,
they didn't leave just one so

00:17:28.548 --> 00:17:31.250
people could see what it was
like, what was the market.

00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:33.660
And I was lucky because the
first time I ever was in Paris,

00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:35.941
when I was a kid,
somebody took me down there in

00:17:35.941 --> 00:17:39.022
the middle of the night and you
could see the butchers drinking

00:17:39.022 --> 00:17:41.109
with very sort of
friqué,

00:17:41.109 --> 00:17:47.220
very prosperous clients eating
at a big table next to there.

00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:49.145
And it was fantastic,
it was the guts of Paris,

00:17:49.145 --> 00:17:51.490
it was the heart of Paris,
and they just destroyed it.

00:17:51.490 --> 00:17:55.559
And they had to move the market
out by Orly Airport because

00:17:55.559 --> 00:17:58.716
Paris is so big,
with eleven million people in

00:17:58.716 --> 00:18:01.993
the region now.
But it didn't make any sense to

00:18:01.993 --> 00:18:04.438
destroy them all,
it was such vandalism,

00:18:04.438 --> 00:18:07.317
just incredible,
and it came at the time of

00:18:07.317 --> 00:18:10.821
Pompidou, who said that "we must
renounce this outmoded

00:18:10.821 --> 00:18:13.040
aesthetic";
that is, anything that was

00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:15.713
beautiful and interesting,
and he was a patron of art,

00:18:15.713 --> 00:18:17.730
of modern art in all its worst
forms.

00:18:17.730 --> 00:18:19.422
But, anyway,
rien à

00:18:19.422 --> 00:18:21.986
voir avec.
But okay, here's the

00:18:21.986 --> 00:18:26.457
continuation of the Rue de
Rivoli which had been begun by

00:18:26.457 --> 00:18:29.809
Napoleon and it gives you major
access,

00:18:29.809 --> 00:18:33.489
that is west/east,
and as we'll see in a minute he

00:18:33.489 --> 00:18:37.470
also creates a north/south
access because--or axis,

00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:39.920
what am I saying?;
well, access, the same thing.

00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:42.369
So, that just gives you kind of
a view from the top.

00:18:42.369 --> 00:18:46.803
And here are these les
halles, this is the old

00:18:46.803 --> 00:18:50.312
market that was there.
And I was lucky because it was

00:18:50.312 --> 00:18:52.799
gone about two years later or
something like that.

00:18:52.799 --> 00:18:58.544
And I met a person who was kind
enough to lodge me,

00:18:58.544 --> 00:19:02.450
and to take me down to see
that.

00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:05.525
And it's just gone.
Now they have yet another plan

00:19:05.525 --> 00:19:08.593
to do something,
and it's just become this--oh

00:19:08.593 --> 00:19:11.032
well, ugh.
Okay, so again bringing-

00:19:11.032 --> 00:19:13.619
freeing the flow of capital,
of commerce,

00:19:13.619 --> 00:19:16.094
et cetera,
et cetera was a worthy goal

00:19:16.094 --> 00:19:19.546
indeed, and one of the things
that Napoleon III did was to

00:19:19.546 --> 00:19:22.150
celebrate France with these
expositions.

00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:25.891
And of course the idea of
having a big exposition is that

00:19:25.891 --> 00:19:28.830
of the Victorians,
the big one in 1851 at the

00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:32.411
Crystal Palace.
The first public toilets,

00:19:32.411 --> 00:19:37.220
by the way, as such things
were, in 1851 in London.

00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:40.330
And, so, Louis Napoleon has
other expositions.

00:19:40.330 --> 00:19:43.502
This one is 1854.
And, so, the principle of this

00:19:43.502 --> 00:19:46.679
is you walk down one of these
exposition halls and you look

00:19:46.679 --> 00:19:48.759
and you see paintings on the
right,

00:19:48.759 --> 00:19:51.825
you see the wonders of science
on the left, et cetera,

00:19:51.825 --> 00:19:54.480
et cetera;
and millions of people go.

00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:57.415
And that's the same principle
as the department store,

00:19:57.415 --> 00:20:00.130
isn't it, except that you can
buy what you see.

00:20:00.130 --> 00:20:04.034
And the department stores,
what they do is they destroy

00:20:04.034 --> 00:20:07.215
local commerce,
unless-- like boot makers and

00:20:07.215 --> 00:20:10.974
very skilled craftsmen are on
the boulevards near the

00:20:10.974 --> 00:20:14.699
department stores,
or provide essential services

00:20:14.699 --> 00:20:18.602
in working class districts.
So, the Grand Magasin du Louvre

00:20:18.602 --> 00:20:22.248
is here, you've all the space,
it becomes as Zola said the

00:20:22.248 --> 00:20:25.509
"cathedral of modernity," along
with the others.

00:20:25.509 --> 00:20:29.083
Now, there are the equivalent
of department stores in Paris in

00:20:29.083 --> 00:20:32.364
some of the arcades already in
the 18--not arcades in our

00:20:32.364 --> 00:20:35.498
sense,
but the arcades in the Parisian

00:20:35.498 --> 00:20:39.280
sense--in the 1820s,
and there are even sort of

00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:42.980
proto department stores exist
before that.

00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:45.343
But it's the '50s and '60s that
brings to London,

00:20:45.343 --> 00:20:46.869
and to Vienna,
and to Berlin,

00:20:46.869 --> 00:20:50.192
and to Paris the department
store, where you could buy forty

00:20:50.192 --> 00:20:53.827
different kinds of shawls,
cheap shawls to very fancy

00:20:53.827 --> 00:20:56.517
shawls.
So, it's going to attract not

00:20:56.517 --> 00:21:00.490
only ordinary people looking
occasionally for bargains.

00:21:00.490 --> 00:21:04.159
And, as I said before,
it's a form of--it creates jobs

00:21:04.159 --> 00:21:08.245
for working class and peasant
women who becomes sales clerks

00:21:08.245 --> 00:21:12.538
living in terrible conditions in
kind of dormitories and almost

00:21:12.538 --> 00:21:15.344
prison-like rules;
but it also brings the

00:21:15.344 --> 00:21:18.048
friqué,
the wealthy people will come in

00:21:18.048 --> 00:21:21.220
their carriages and have their
drivers await them when they go

00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:24.599
in and listen to people sing
Christmas carols on the stairs.

00:21:24.599 --> 00:21:30.826
And when electricity becomes
common in the 1880s and 1890s

00:21:30.826 --> 00:21:37.489
you have these dazzling displays
that change in the--along the

00:21:37.489 --> 00:21:41.789
streets,
and so they become really a

00:21:41.789 --> 00:21:46.827
site of tourism themselves.
And, so, here your basic idea

00:21:46.827 --> 00:21:51.170
is to create--the problem is how
do you get from--this is north,

00:21:51.170 --> 00:21:53.284
this is south,
and this is east,

00:21:53.284 --> 00:21:57.240
this is west--that there was no
way of getting anywhere.

00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:59.610
The two biggest streets in
Paris in terms of the most

00:21:59.610 --> 00:22:01.889
important ones were the Rue
Saint-Denis and the Rue

00:22:01.889 --> 00:22:04.259
Saint-Martin--please don't
remember these names.

00:22:04.259 --> 00:22:07.153
And, so, what they do is they
create the Boulevard

00:22:07.153 --> 00:22:09.279
Saint-Michel,
which is a disaster,

00:22:09.279 --> 00:22:12.682
here, and then--because
McDonald's and all this stuff,

00:22:12.682 --> 00:22:14.930
just awful, just terrible
zoning;

00:22:14.930 --> 00:22:17.203
and then here,
what became the Boulevard

00:22:17.203 --> 00:22:20.527
Sebastopol, the Boulevard
Saint-Denis that goes out to the

00:22:20.527 --> 00:22:22.521
railroad stations.
And, of course,

00:22:22.521 --> 00:22:25.270
Haussmann is often castigated
for having built the railroad

00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:28.203
stations next to each other,
without having anticipated the

00:22:28.203 --> 00:22:31.080
automobile, but how could he
have known about the automobile

00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:33.694
in the 1850s and '60s?
So, they complete the sort of

00:22:33.694 --> 00:22:36.099
star, the Étoile here,
which is the place,

00:22:36.099 --> 00:22:41.685
place of the Arc de
Triomphe, and creates--he

00:22:41.685 --> 00:22:47.022
finishes the Rue de Rivoli here,
and of course it's along that

00:22:47.022 --> 00:22:49.635
axis, as you saw,
that the troops come in May of

00:22:49.635 --> 00:22:52.728
1851,
decimating those who resisted

00:22:52.728 --> 00:22:57.286
in these neighborhoods.
So, those are basically the

00:22:57.286 --> 00:23:01.970
plans that he wanted to do.
So, here we go.

00:23:01.970 --> 00:23:05.540
This is the Rue de Rivoli,
this is down its sort of

00:23:05.540 --> 00:23:08.039
completion, this is heading
east,

00:23:08.039 --> 00:23:11.692
and the troops move down this
way, and that,

00:23:11.692 --> 00:23:15.123
it just parallels the Seine.
This is the tower,

00:23:15.123 --> 00:23:17.725
the remaining part of the
tour of Saint-Jacques

00:23:17.725 --> 00:23:21.436
that is there.
And, then, now this is looking

00:23:21.436 --> 00:23:25.559
north and you're crossing
Cité now.

00:23:25.559 --> 00:23:28.092
This is where the police were,
at the Châtelet in the

00:23:28.092 --> 00:23:30.808
eighteenth century.
But the point is that you see

00:23:30.808 --> 00:23:34.530
in the distance the Station of
the East, the Gare de l'est.

00:23:34.530 --> 00:23:38.205
And so he's very successful.
In many ways he's not an

00:23:38.205 --> 00:23:40.369
interesting man,
Haussmann.

00:23:40.369 --> 00:23:42.039
I was asked to write a
biography of him once and I

00:23:42.039 --> 00:23:43.470
didn't do it,
I gave it to someone else.

00:23:43.470 --> 00:23:45.950
And of course Paris is the big
story.

00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:49.457
He was a fonctionnaire,
he was a technocrat,

00:23:49.457 --> 00:23:53.526
but he was very good at what he
did, from repress people to

00:23:53.526 --> 00:23:57.201
building boulevards.
And, so, this is a success

00:23:57.201 --> 00:24:01.490
there, it frees up the flow of
circulation, but it chases

00:24:01.490 --> 00:24:06.009
people like this--this is a pawn
shop that still exists,

00:24:06.009 --> 00:24:08.666
it's a municipal pawnshop,
it's exactly the same space

00:24:08.666 --> 00:24:12.168
where it was at this time.
And anyone who looked at this

00:24:12.168 --> 00:24:16.220
would know what the image is,
because these people are so

00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:19.910
poor they are about to sell back
their mattress.

00:24:19.910 --> 00:24:23.267
Remember what I said in
L'Assommoir that Gervaise

00:24:23.267 --> 00:24:26.319
dies like a dog on a bed of
straw, more or less.

00:24:26.319 --> 00:24:30.249
The last dignity that you had
was to still have a mattress,

00:24:30.249 --> 00:24:33.298
and when things got so bad that
was what went,

00:24:33.298 --> 00:24:36.326
the mattress.
And so these folks are tearing

00:24:36.326 --> 00:24:40.329
out--carrying mattresses to try
to get what they can from them.

00:24:40.329 --> 00:24:44.476
And then you've got the very
poor down-and-out being expelled

00:24:44.476 --> 00:24:48.576
to the periphery even more.
This is a place where people

00:24:48.576 --> 00:24:53.220
could get a little bit of food
from charitable organizations.

00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:56.312
This is in Montmartre.
And I just put this in,

00:24:56.312 --> 00:24:59.448
it's around the corner actually
from our apartment,

00:24:59.448 --> 00:25:02.710
but this is a classic kind of
Haussmann building,

00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:05.787
and architects had started to
sign their work on the

00:25:05.787 --> 00:25:08.080
première
étage,

00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:11.312
on the second floor.
So, this architect was called

00:25:11.312 --> 00:25:14.781
David and it has the date there.
And these balconies are more

00:25:14.781 --> 00:25:16.987
ornate, really,
than the ones that they did in

00:25:16.987 --> 00:25:18.799
general, at the time of
Haussmann.

00:25:18.799 --> 00:25:20.920
These are more sort of Third
Republic ones.

00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:25.115
But these are some very
handsome buildings that

00:25:25.115 --> 00:25:30.406
lined--this is that line of
boulevard that lines the Rue du

00:25:30.406 --> 00:25:32.964
Temple.
Now, and here we've got--this

00:25:32.964 --> 00:25:36.180
is cracked, I'm sorry--but this
is the Station of the East.

00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:39.485
And when I see the station it
always gives me a twinge of

00:25:39.485 --> 00:25:42.791
sadness because in 1914 all the
people charging up to the

00:25:42.791 --> 00:25:44.676
station,
screaming, "à

00:25:44.676 --> 00:25:46.723
Berlin, à
Berlin," "to Berlin,

00:25:46.723 --> 00:25:49.047
to Berlin,"
and this is one of the,

00:25:49.047 --> 00:25:53.031
along with the Station of the
North, led the troops to the

00:25:53.031 --> 00:25:54.671
fronts,
from which many of

00:25:54.671 --> 00:25:56.240
them--most--well,
many of them,

00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:58.279
a million and a half never
returned.

00:25:58.279 --> 00:26:01.052
And also so many,
from these stations,

00:26:01.052 --> 00:26:04.500
so many Jews were rounded up by
the Germans,

00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:09.149
but above all by the French
police, in 1942 and 1943 were

00:26:09.149 --> 00:26:14.343
sent on their way to Drancy,
to the transit camp north of

00:26:14.343 --> 00:26:18.109
Paris, and then on to the death
camps.

00:26:18.109 --> 00:26:25.199
And again one of the themes is
that all of this makes this

00:26:25.199 --> 00:26:30.049
west/east division even more
salient,

00:26:30.049 --> 00:26:37.039
and makes the center periphery
contrast or juxtaposition even

00:26:37.039 --> 00:26:41.113
more important.
Louis-Napoleon has spent a lot

00:26:41.113 --> 00:26:45.427
of time in London.
He loved parks and so he has

00:26:45.427 --> 00:26:51.509
them work on the Bois de
Boulogne, to the west of Paris,

00:26:51.509 --> 00:26:54.643
fancy, feeding the--or
receiving people from the

00:26:54.643 --> 00:26:57.076
fancier quarters.
And these kinds of

00:26:57.076 --> 00:26:59.863
cafés-concert
along the Champs

00:26:59.863 --> 00:27:03.297
Élysées are part
again of this east/west

00:27:03.297 --> 00:27:04.270
dichotomy.

00:27:11.490 --> 00:27:14.484
And, then, that's not to say
that there weren't parks in the

00:27:14.484 --> 00:27:16.839
east.
This is the Butte de Chaumont,

00:27:16.839 --> 00:27:20.173
which is to the east,
and there's--apparently a lot

00:27:20.173 --> 00:27:24.440
of real high stakes boule
games are still played here.

00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:27.189
So, there were places.
Paris has very little green

00:27:27.189 --> 00:27:29.190
space compared to London and
Berlin.

00:27:29.190 --> 00:27:31.977
Berlin, twenty-five percent of
Berlin is green space and

00:27:31.977 --> 00:27:35.210
London's about the same thing;
Paris it's five percent.

00:27:35.210 --> 00:27:40.416
And, then, there's the Bois de
Vincennes which is out to the

00:27:40.416 --> 00:27:43.666
east as well.
But here is again--this is your

00:27:43.666 --> 00:27:45.779
image of the Belle
Époque.

00:27:45.779 --> 00:27:49.343
Here you've got carriages
carrying fancy people along,

00:27:49.343 --> 00:27:52.099
you have the kiosks selling
newspapers,

00:27:52.099 --> 00:27:55.512
you have trees,
you have these boulevards that

00:27:55.512 --> 00:27:59.524
had been created by Haussmann.
Now, to be sure now there were

00:27:59.524 --> 00:28:02.059
boulevards in European cities
before Haussmann.

00:28:02.059 --> 00:28:06.313
They tended to be on the
outskirts of cities,

00:28:06.313 --> 00:28:11.049
and they were built where there
had been walls,

00:28:11.049 --> 00:28:14.994
military fortifications,
in a way replaced ramparts that

00:28:14.994 --> 00:28:17.989
had been torn down.
The best example,

00:28:17.989 --> 00:28:23.509
and many of you may know this,
is Vienna with the Ringstrasse,

00:28:23.509 --> 00:28:28.895
which was really a creation of
the liberal period in Viennese

00:28:28.895 --> 00:28:32.623
history, in the 1850s,
and '60s, and '70s,

00:28:32.623 --> 00:28:37.180
and which was on where there
had been fortified walls.

00:28:37.180 --> 00:28:41.099
And in the case of Paris the
best example is Montparnasse.

00:28:41.099 --> 00:28:44.765
Boulevard Montparnasse is on
where there had been military

00:28:44.765 --> 00:28:47.145
fortifications but,
as Paris expanded,

00:28:47.145 --> 00:28:50.490
the fortifications had to keep
being pushed out.

00:28:50.490 --> 00:28:56.203
So, this is the Boulevard
Montmartre here in 1900,

00:28:56.203 --> 00:29:02.967
and then the next one is the
slide that--it will be a color

00:29:02.967 --> 00:29:10.430
picture--and this is Pissarro's
view of that same boulevard.

00:29:10.430 --> 00:29:13.809
And my great friend Bob
Herbert, the fantastic social

00:29:13.809 --> 00:29:16.865
historian of art,
actually found the place where

00:29:16.865 --> 00:29:20.180
Pissarro was looking out the
window to do this.

00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:24.573
Here again, it's an obvious
theme, but the light and the

00:29:24.573 --> 00:29:29.267
movement and the first painting,
what strikes you at the first

00:29:29.267 --> 00:29:32.813
glance, Paris was really,
the Paris of the boulevards

00:29:32.813 --> 00:29:36.359
were really made for the
Impressionist paintings.

00:29:36.359 --> 00:29:39.863
And the only working-class
impressionist painter was

00:29:39.863 --> 00:29:43.710
Renoir, and it was Renoir whom I
quoted the other day.

00:29:43.710 --> 00:29:46.389
He started out as a porcelain
painter in Limoges,

00:29:46.389 --> 00:29:49.012
painting porcelain,
and it was he that said that

00:29:49.012 --> 00:29:52.194
these boulevards reminded him of
the soldiers lined up for

00:29:52.194 --> 00:29:54.339
review.
Again, that's not a bad

00:29:54.339 --> 00:29:57.609
description of the imperialism
of the straight line.

00:29:57.609 --> 00:30:00.959
But it was these boulevards,
and its commerce,

00:30:00.959 --> 00:30:05.349
and its wealthy people that the
anarchists so much hated.

00:30:05.349 --> 00:30:07.630
And again here,
this is a place,

00:30:07.630 --> 00:30:11.109
and this is--I threw this in
for people that know something

00:30:11.109 --> 00:30:13.750
about Impressionist
paintings--this became an

00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:17.902
Impressionist painting,
and I didn't get the slide,

00:30:17.902 --> 00:30:22.727
kind of an important street or
intersection because the

00:30:22.727 --> 00:30:27.551
Impressionist collector and
painter Caillebotte did his

00:30:27.551 --> 00:30:31.180
Paris,
the Effect of the

00:30:31.180 --> 00:30:35.819
Rain, where he has bourgeois
couples crossing the street,

00:30:35.819 --> 00:30:39.868
near each other,
but having nothing in common

00:30:39.868 --> 00:30:44.470
with each other,
part of the anomie of the city;

00:30:44.470 --> 00:30:50.044
and it was a statement about
the sort of self-importance of

00:30:50.044 --> 00:30:54.082
the middle class.
And some of Caillebotte's other

00:30:54.082 --> 00:30:58.151
paintings involve views from
balconies in which the person

00:30:58.151 --> 00:31:01.863
is--the viewer or the main
subject of the painting is

00:31:01.863 --> 00:31:06.359
isolated from ordinary people
who might walk around below.

00:31:06.359 --> 00:31:10.324
And you can over-emphasize his
themes too much but it's still

00:31:10.324 --> 00:31:14.006
worth keeping in mind.
But here you have your basic

00:31:14.006 --> 00:31:18.125
Impressionist landscape,
and it was very much a creation

00:31:18.125 --> 00:31:22.020
of the rebuilding of Paris in
the 1850s and '60s,

00:31:22.020 --> 00:31:25.343
urban landscape.
So, again, this is a great

00:31:25.343 --> 00:31:30.208
example of the way in which not
all boulevards were created by

00:31:30.208 --> 00:31:34.528
the Alsatian Attila in Paris.
Some, as I suggested a few

00:31:34.528 --> 00:31:37.590
minutes ago, followed the routes
of the walls,

00:31:37.590 --> 00:31:40.720
and here's the best example one
could pick.

00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:44.378
This was, at the time of the
French Revolution,

00:31:44.378 --> 00:31:51.442
the city limits.
The two gates like this were

00:31:51.442 --> 00:32:02.910
called the Porte Saint-Denis and
the Porte Saint-Martin.

00:32:02.910 --> 00:32:07.028
And it was when Louis XVI and
Marie Antoinette tried to

00:32:07.028 --> 00:32:11.528
escape, and probably disguised
as retainers for some wealthy

00:32:11.528 --> 00:32:14.478
baroness,
they were able to get through

00:32:14.478 --> 00:32:17.381
this particular gate because the
guards were

00:32:17.381 --> 00:32:21.202
bourrés,
they were all drunk from having

00:32:21.202 --> 00:32:24.845
been at a wedding.
And then the tax collected on

00:32:24.845 --> 00:32:29.920
what you brought into the city
passed right through this gate.

00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:32.523
You had to pay a tax on what
you brought into the city,

00:32:32.523 --> 00:32:36.572
more about that in a minute.
But you can see that these

00:32:36.572 --> 00:32:42.679
boulevards become extensions of
these walls that had once been

00:32:42.679 --> 00:32:45.334
there.
And in the case of the Porte

00:32:45.334 --> 00:32:48.655
Saint-Martin and the Porte
Saint-Denis, they are still

00:32:48.655 --> 00:32:50.798
there.
And of course the Porte

00:32:50.798 --> 00:32:54.230
Saint-Denis is going north to
the cathedral town of

00:32:54.230 --> 00:32:56.986
Saint-Denis,
or village of Saint-Denis,

00:32:56.986 --> 00:32:59.576
or small town,
which became an important

00:32:59.576 --> 00:33:02.099
center of working class
production,

00:33:02.099 --> 00:33:05.680
and subsequently of anarchism,
socialism, and ultimately

00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:08.349
communism, more about that in a
minute.

00:33:08.349 --> 00:33:10.810
Now, you still have traditional
work done in Paris,

00:33:10.810 --> 00:33:13.370
as I suggested when we were
talking about the garment

00:33:13.370 --> 00:33:16.034
industry,
and you still had cases where

00:33:16.034 --> 00:33:19.733
the father is literally the
foreman, and his family is

00:33:19.733 --> 00:33:23.238
working for him,
through sub-contracting,

00:33:23.238 --> 00:33:27.323
people working at what was a
rather large--no,

00:33:27.323 --> 00:33:31.414
this is an atelier,
this is not their home--well,

00:33:31.414 --> 00:33:35.170
you got pots and things hanging
around, a big roof.

00:33:35.170 --> 00:33:37.752
But, anyway,
it's in the eastern part of

00:33:37.752 --> 00:33:41.792
Paris, and in the northeastern,
and in the suburbs that you've

00:33:41.792 --> 00:33:45.104
got the conversion of old
buildings into industrial

00:33:45.104 --> 00:33:49.515
production,
and you have new industries

00:33:49.515 --> 00:33:54.504
perched on the edge of the city.
And this is the rue,

00:33:54.504 --> 00:33:57.086
the faubourg of
Saint-Antoine which at the time

00:33:57.086 --> 00:33:59.619
of the French Revolution was
beyond the Bastille,

00:33:59.619 --> 00:34:05.251
and it was lots of these people
who were cabinet workers who

00:34:05.251 --> 00:34:10.396
stormed the Bastille in 1789;
but again the contrast between

00:34:10.396 --> 00:34:13.802
center and periphery.
This is a somewhat sympathetic

00:34:13.802 --> 00:34:16.805
but also a little bit
condescending look at popular

00:34:16.805 --> 00:34:20.289
sociability in these cabarets
that I talked about the other

00:34:20.289 --> 00:34:23.242
day,
on the edge of--the perception,

00:34:23.242 --> 00:34:27.988
middle class perception of the
drunken commoner perched on the

00:34:27.988 --> 00:34:32.593
edge of urban life,
on the margins of urban life,

00:34:32.593 --> 00:34:35.730
drinking it up.
And these are really great.

00:34:35.730 --> 00:34:39.706
I put these next two in simply
to show you the difference

00:34:39.706 --> 00:34:43.753
between--or give you images of
the difference between what

00:34:43.753 --> 00:34:47.019
happens to the western districts
of Paris,

00:34:47.019 --> 00:34:49.480
on the edge,
and those of the east.

00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:52.993
Now, this is the east,
on the very edge,

00:34:52.993 --> 00:34:56.777
and these are sort of rural
looking houses,

00:34:56.777 --> 00:35:01.597
with slanted roofs like that.
This is the laundry of combat,

00:35:01.597 --> 00:35:05.106
so this is a real kind of
socialist image from the turn of

00:35:05.106 --> 00:35:07.854
the century.
This has got to be right before

00:35:07.854 --> 00:35:09.730
World War I.
How do we know that?

00:35:09.730 --> 00:35:12.732
Because this is something of
the métro,

00:35:12.732 --> 00:35:15.329
and the first metro opened
along the Seine,

00:35:15.329 --> 00:35:18.671
paralleling the Seine,
on July 14th,

00:35:18.671 --> 00:35:22.572
1900, for the exhibition;
it's now the line that goes to

00:35:22.572 --> 00:35:24.688
Île-de-France all the way
out to Vincennes,

00:35:24.688 --> 00:35:26.610
to the east.
And then the lines were

00:35:26.610 --> 00:35:30.907
subsequently extended out.
So, this is probably about

00:35:30.907 --> 00:35:34.541
1912,1913.
But this is still kind of

00:35:34.541 --> 00:35:40.498
a--these are industrial suburbs
that have been created by both

00:35:40.498 --> 00:35:44.599
the industrial conglomeration of
Paris,

00:35:44.599 --> 00:35:50.847
the availability of land and of
capital on the outside of Paris,

00:35:50.847 --> 00:35:55.287
and of a workforce,
of a very transient but still

00:35:55.287 --> 00:35:59.031
massive workforce there.
And then if we go off in the

00:35:59.031 --> 00:36:01.905
other direction,
on the edge-- and this would be

00:36:01.905 --> 00:36:05.512
what the equivalent now of the
seventeenth arrondissement--I

00:36:05.512 --> 00:36:08.752
reversed this but it doesn't
make the slightest bit of

00:36:08.752 --> 00:36:12.298
difference--you see that this
building is sort of a solidly

00:36:12.298 --> 00:36:16.157
artisanal,
lower-middle-class building

00:36:16.157 --> 00:36:22.050
that reflects the fact that in
many ways the western half of

00:36:22.050 --> 00:36:25.677
Paris,
including even the western

00:36:25.677 --> 00:36:31.188
periphery, was very different.
I say that with some--once you

00:36:31.188 --> 00:36:35.329
get the image that all the
suburbs in the west were like

00:36:35.329 --> 00:36:38.190
Versailles, Argenteuil for
example.

00:36:38.190 --> 00:36:40.561
Five people broke into the
Musée d'Orsay over the

00:36:40.561 --> 00:36:42.329
weekend, and for some--whatever
reason,

00:36:42.329 --> 00:36:45.264
they're all drunked up,
poked a big hole in Monet's

00:36:45.264 --> 00:36:48.139
great The Bridge at
Argenteuil painting,

00:36:48.139 --> 00:36:49.940
which is really kind of amazing
damage.

00:36:49.940 --> 00:36:53.093
But Argenteuil was a place
where you had leisure,

00:36:53.093 --> 00:36:56.050
you had sailboats,
you had people of means.

00:36:56.050 --> 00:37:00.889
You no longer had vineyards at
all but you also had industry.

00:37:00.889 --> 00:37:04.774
And Monet, the painter Claude
Monet, his depictions of

00:37:04.774 --> 00:37:09.172
Argenteuil, you have the smoke
stacks become just part of the

00:37:09.172 --> 00:37:13.789
scene and it's a very neutral
kind of look at smoke stacks,

00:37:13.789 --> 00:37:16.921
not clearly differentiated even
from these sailboats,

00:37:16.921 --> 00:37:19.449
sort of in the regattas and all
of that.

00:37:19.449 --> 00:37:22.814
But Monet, as my friend Bob
Herbert, who pointed this out,

00:37:22.814 --> 00:37:24.940
Monet when he lives at
Argenteuil,

00:37:24.940 --> 00:37:29.766
he gets tired of that,
he gets tired of kind of the

00:37:29.766 --> 00:37:35.751
contradictions of capitalism and
industrialization and he longs

00:37:35.751 --> 00:37:39.420
for this non-urban
paysage,

00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:43.320
this non-urban scenes to paint.
And what does he do?

00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:45.179
As you all know he moves to
Giverny;

00:37:45.179 --> 00:37:50.784
Giverny along the Seine,
and a railroad track runs right

00:37:50.784 --> 00:37:55.165
through his backyard and he
never paints it,

00:37:55.165 --> 00:37:59.537
not once.
What he does is he creates this

00:37:59.537 --> 00:38:04.650
kind of idyllic rural scene of
lily pads and ponds.

00:38:04.650 --> 00:38:07.449
And it's a wonderful experience
to go there, if you're not

00:38:07.449 --> 00:38:10.229
trampled by the 40,000 tourists.
You can imagine this is

00:38:10.229 --> 00:38:13.269
someplace where someone lived,
and ran up and down the stairs,

00:38:13.269 --> 00:38:15.909
and had fun,
and then went out and got away

00:38:15.909 --> 00:38:18.550
from the sort of industry of
Argenteuil.

00:38:18.550 --> 00:38:21.939
But, anyway,
he was moving on to a different

00:38:21.939 --> 00:38:26.765
stage.
And, so, what you get on the

00:38:26.765 --> 00:38:31.860
edge of Paris,
the west, is this.

00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:33.909
This is the Avenue of the
Grande Armée.

00:38:33.909 --> 00:38:37.489
So this is beyond the Arc de
Triomphe.

00:38:37.489 --> 00:38:41.803
And now this is going out to
Neuilly which is a very--right

00:38:41.803 --> 00:38:44.630
on the edge of the Bois de
Boulogne,

00:38:44.630 --> 00:38:47.538
which became a very,
very prosperous suburb,

00:38:47.538 --> 00:38:50.380
and certainly still is,
that's for sure.

00:38:50.380 --> 00:38:54.278
And what you had on the other
side of the east was very

00:38:54.278 --> 00:38:57.887
different, in the north and
northeast was extremely

00:38:57.887 --> 00:39:00.920
different, it wasn't like that
at all.

00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:05.791
And, so, what happens when
you--the images that I showed

00:39:05.791 --> 00:39:11.195
you before of those big arcs of
triumph that--in which you--in

00:39:11.195 --> 00:39:15.269
which I said the king had
escaped through,

00:39:15.269 --> 00:39:19.369
trying to get out of France
during the French Revolution.

00:39:19.369 --> 00:39:23.579
And I said that you paid on
what you brought in.

00:39:23.579 --> 00:39:26.246
And just in conclusion,
for the last seven minutes,

00:39:26.246 --> 00:39:29.286
I'm going to talk a little bit
about a theme that's rather

00:39:29.286 --> 00:39:32.207
interesting,
and that's why European suburbs

00:39:32.207 --> 00:39:36.143
are so different than American
suburbs--more about that in a

00:39:36.143 --> 00:39:39.443
minute.
But the walls around Paris,

00:39:39.443 --> 00:39:45.002
when they lost their military
purposes, still had a fiscal

00:39:45.002 --> 00:39:50.659
purpose which was to provide a
means of collecting taxes on

00:39:50.659 --> 00:39:55.119
what you brought into town.
And this wall,

00:39:55.119 --> 00:39:59.710
or this taxing apparatus,
is called in French the

00:39:59.710 --> 00:40:02.579
octroi,
o-c-t-r-o-i.

00:40:02.579 --> 00:40:03.960
And I love these little
buildings.

00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:08.020
You can see some near Nation,
Place de la Nation,

00:40:08.020 --> 00:40:11.320
and other--in Thar-cor,
in the Loire,

00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:13.314
there's a fantastic one,
you see them all over the

00:40:13.314 --> 00:40:14.780
place, and they're just
beautiful.

00:40:14.780 --> 00:40:16.967
Sometimes people live in them.
But this lasts,

00:40:16.967 --> 00:40:20.564
this isn't something that
disappeared in 1850 or 1900,

00:40:20.564 --> 00:40:24.303
it lasts till World War II.
And thus that's the big way

00:40:24.303 --> 00:40:27.900
that municipalities were able to
raise any money at all,

00:40:27.900 --> 00:40:30.878
since basically wealthy people
didn't pay taxes,

00:40:30.878 --> 00:40:33.730
and that's why--it's a very
regressive tax,

00:40:33.730 --> 00:40:36.678
it's like a huge sales tax,
and France is nothing if it's

00:40:36.678 --> 00:40:39.786
not full of regressive taxes,
since the value-added tax is

00:40:39.786 --> 00:40:42.263
twenty-one percent,
and on electronics and stuff

00:40:42.263 --> 00:40:44.320
like that it's thirty-three
percent.

00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:47.885
So, you're taxed on what you
buy, and since poor people have

00:40:47.885 --> 00:40:51.210
less money to buy things it
really is totally unfair.

00:40:51.210 --> 00:40:53.801
But the origins of this system
is in the octroi,

00:40:53.801 --> 00:40:56.488
and this is one of those
actually fairly rare photos that

00:40:56.488 --> 00:40:59.061
I know of,
of what it was like in your

00:40:59.061 --> 00:41:02.090
sort of diligence,
your coach here.

00:41:02.090 --> 00:41:04.709
This was called an
imperial because people

00:41:04.709 --> 00:41:07.110
rode on the top,
and you're leaving Paris,

00:41:07.110 --> 00:41:09.487
or you're entering Paris,
it doesn't matter at all,

00:41:09.487 --> 00:41:11.579
but the point is that you were
controlled,

00:41:11.579 --> 00:41:15.579
day or night,
when you went through.

00:41:15.579 --> 00:41:21.614
And on the edge of Paris are
created these working-class

00:41:21.614 --> 00:41:27.210
industrial suburbs that are
feared by the center,

00:41:27.210 --> 00:41:32.601
and during the 1920s and 1930s
become major sources of support

00:41:32.601 --> 00:41:35.847
for the Communist Party,
because people,

00:41:35.847 --> 00:41:39.258
most of the people who lived
there were extremely badly

00:41:39.258 --> 00:41:41.350
lodged,
and the Communists do very well

00:41:41.350 --> 00:41:44.178
because of the mal-lotis,
that is people who are badly

00:41:44.178 --> 00:41:46.949
lodged,
and they provide services to

00:41:46.949 --> 00:41:51.876
poor working families that in
other municipalities simply one

00:41:51.876 --> 00:41:54.679
did not have.
And if you go to something like

00:41:54.679 --> 00:41:56.360
the Fête de
l'Humanité,

00:41:56.360 --> 00:41:58.090
which is the big Communist
party,

00:41:58.090 --> 00:42:02.035
every year, a big boom,
a big--which means a big party,

00:42:02.035 --> 00:42:04.300
full of speeches and all of
that,

00:42:04.300 --> 00:42:06.881
you could kind of go from one
booth and have your oysters in

00:42:06.881 --> 00:42:09.782
the Finistère booth,
and then go have paella in the

00:42:09.782 --> 00:42:12.176
Catalan booth,
and then have goat's cheese in

00:42:12.176 --> 00:42:15.155
the Ardèche booth,
et cetera, et cetera,

00:42:15.155 --> 00:42:17.857
and Beaujolais in the
Rhône booth,

00:42:17.857 --> 00:42:22.118
et cetera, et cetera.
But the association between

00:42:22.118 --> 00:42:27.989
working-class people on the edge
of--on the margins of the big

00:42:27.989 --> 00:42:33.572
city and radical politics is
terribly important in the '20s

00:42:33.572 --> 00:42:36.449
and '30s,
and even much later than that.

00:42:36.449 --> 00:42:40.733
And this is a town called
Corbevoie, which is north of

00:42:40.733 --> 00:42:45.664
Paris, and they all have streets
called something like the Rue

00:42:45.664 --> 00:42:48.675
Maurice Thorez,
who was a miner who was a

00:42:48.675 --> 00:42:51.920
leader of the Communist Party,
following the dictates of

00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:56.940
Moscow,
alas, in the 1930s.

00:42:56.940 --> 00:42:59.743
Many of them still have an
Avenue Jean Jaurès,

00:42:59.743 --> 00:43:03.623
for obvious reasons.
But it's this growth of all of

00:43:03.623 --> 00:43:09.010
these industrial suburbs that is
one of the important sort of

00:43:09.010 --> 00:43:13.409
concomitants of large-scale
industrialization,

00:43:13.409 --> 00:43:17.690
and the identification of the
urban periphery with industrial

00:43:17.690 --> 00:43:19.980
work.
Many of the so-called dirty

00:43:19.980 --> 00:43:23.163
industries, chemical production,
soap production,

00:43:23.163 --> 00:43:26.213
things that smell,
are forced out of the center

00:43:26.213 --> 00:43:29.292
and onto the periphery.
And so that's where the

00:43:29.292 --> 00:43:31.685
factories are,
that's where the cheapest labor

00:43:31.685 --> 00:43:34.449
is to be found--more about this
in just a second,

00:43:34.449 --> 00:43:38.300
I'll just finish this off with
a Monet of Argenteuil;

00:43:38.300 --> 00:43:40.730
again, this one does-it's not
the Pont d'Argenteuil,

00:43:40.730 --> 00:43:42.909
if I'd had time I would have
gone to get that one,

00:43:42.909 --> 00:43:45.800
the painting was just ripped by
vandals over the weekend.

00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:49.736
But, again, the extension of
the sort of prosperity to the

00:43:49.736 --> 00:43:53.810
west is obviously the Normand
coast because the turbo trains

00:43:53.810 --> 00:43:56.780
are already going to the Normand
coast,

00:43:56.780 --> 00:44:00.969
Deauville is not far away,
Etretat and these kinds of

00:44:00.969 --> 00:44:04.327
places are there.
And so that's an extension of

00:44:04.327 --> 00:44:07.792
this west/east dichotomy,
that people from eastern Paris

00:44:07.792 --> 00:44:11.510
or from the northern suburbs are
not going to Deauville,

00:44:11.510 --> 00:44:13.203
for the weekend,
they're not the kind of people

00:44:13.203 --> 00:44:14.969
who are going to be painted by
Berthe Morisot.

00:44:14.969 --> 00:44:18.533
But, so, these spacial
concomitants or aspects even

00:44:18.533 --> 00:44:22.737
continue to the planting of the
Parisian flag on the Normand

00:44:22.737 --> 00:44:25.658
coast;
and again, that's a subject for

00:44:25.658 --> 00:44:29.150
another excellent book by my
friend Bob Herbert.

00:44:29.150 --> 00:44:32.421
Now, I want to finish off,
I want to get some more light

00:44:32.421 --> 00:44:35.181
so I can see you all.
How to do this,

00:44:35.181 --> 00:44:39.156
how to do this in five minutes?
I'll do this in the following

00:44:39.156 --> 00:44:43.289
way.
In 1991--was it 1991?

00:44:43.289 --> 00:44:45.894
Or 1992, at the time of the
Rodney King riots,

00:44:45.894 --> 00:44:48.898
was that 1992?
Rodney King was an

00:44:48.898 --> 00:44:53.886
Afro-American in L.A.
and the police basically just

00:44:53.886 --> 00:44:58.019
beat the hell out of him,
and they're acquitted,

00:44:58.019 --> 00:45:02.914
and it led to some very
difficult times in Los Angeles,

00:45:02.914 --> 00:45:06.449
with lots of riots and lots of
anger.

00:45:06.449 --> 00:45:08.783
And we were doing,
a bunch of us,

00:45:08.783 --> 00:45:12.793
an edited book on the Red
suburbs, on precisely this and

00:45:12.793 --> 00:45:17.022
working class suburbs and their
sort of identification with

00:45:17.022 --> 00:45:21.029
radical politics.
And people in France kept

00:45:21.029 --> 00:45:25.594
asking me, they couldn't
understand the concept of

00:45:25.594 --> 00:45:29.599
wealthy suburbs and impoverished
people,

00:45:29.599 --> 00:45:32.920
minorities living in the center
of cities.

00:45:32.920 --> 00:45:35.369
And finally they stopped--even
press, well I could write

00:45:35.369 --> 00:45:38.135
something--not because of me,
but I just wrote something,

00:45:38.135 --> 00:45:40.137
an epilogue,
trying to explain why it is

00:45:40.137 --> 00:45:42.140
that in Europe things are
different.

00:45:42.140 --> 00:45:47.041
Now, and it's not entirely so.
After all, Versailles was a

00:45:47.041 --> 00:45:49.252
suburb.
In the early 1830s one of the

00:45:49.252 --> 00:45:52.119
ministers of Louis-Philippe went
to him and said,

00:45:52.119 --> 00:45:55.302
"Sir, these factories that
you're allowing the prefect of

00:45:55.302 --> 00:45:57.860
police to tolerate on the edge
of the city,

00:45:57.860 --> 00:46:00.599
will be the cord that wrings
our neck one day."

00:46:00.599 --> 00:46:05.360
Fear of the periphery,
not fear of the center.

00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:08.442
In 1831 and 1834,
Lyon, the suburb of the

00:46:08.442 --> 00:46:10.753
Croix-Rousse,
the silk workers,

00:46:10.753 --> 00:46:14.167
poured down the hill,
defending their rights,

00:46:14.167 --> 00:46:17.853
with signs that said "Live Free
and Die Fighting," and the

00:46:17.853 --> 00:46:21.797
middle-class National Guard set
up their guns to--right at the

00:46:21.797 --> 00:46:24.829
edge of the city,
to keep the suburban people

00:46:24.829 --> 00:46:27.109
from invading the center.
That's very,

00:46:27.109 --> 00:46:28.690
very different,
isn't it?

00:46:28.690 --> 00:46:31.015
Limoges the same thing,
they put up barricades,

00:46:31.015 --> 00:46:33.948
the workers in the suburbs,
that differentiated their space

00:46:33.948 --> 00:46:36.214
with the center.
It is amazing,

00:46:36.214 --> 00:46:41.320
amazing kinds of continuity,
these sort of mutual fears.

00:46:41.320 --> 00:46:44.167
In Detroit, in 1968,
when I was a kid,

00:46:44.167 --> 00:46:47.554
or was it 1967,
I went to a Tiger game and we

00:46:47.554 --> 00:46:52.110
came out of the Tiger game,
double-header with the Yankees,

00:46:52.110 --> 00:46:55.469
and the city was on fire,
and it was the riots of

00:46:55.469 --> 00:46:57.570
Detroit.
And much of Detroit is still

00:46:57.570 --> 00:46:59.900
decimated, has never recovered
from that, never,

00:46:59.900 --> 00:47:02.680
despite the Renaissance Center,
and the occasional success of

00:47:02.680 --> 00:47:04.719
the Tigers, and all good things
like that.

00:47:04.719 --> 00:47:08.888
And one of the suburbs of
Detroit tried at one point to

00:47:08.888 --> 00:47:12.130
change the street patterns so
that they,

00:47:12.130 --> 00:47:15.353
that is the poor people from
the center, could not come out

00:47:15.353 --> 00:47:17.498
to Grosse Pointe,
or Farmington Hills,

00:47:17.498 --> 00:47:20.951
or one of those elegant places.
And I remember that very,

00:47:20.951 --> 00:47:23.317
very vividly.
Now, why did that all happen,

00:47:23.317 --> 00:47:25.388
why?
And we talk--and two years ago

00:47:25.388 --> 00:47:28.253
we had these big riots in France
in the suburbs,

00:47:28.253 --> 00:47:30.203
and it began in
Clichy-sous-Bois,

00:47:30.203 --> 00:47:33.442
and all over the place;
some were exaggerated and all

00:47:33.442 --> 00:47:36.929
of that, and Sarkozy spun it out
of control by calling them scum,

00:47:36.929 --> 00:47:40.168
the people that live on the
periphery, they're scum,

00:47:40.168 --> 00:47:42.010
"racaille,
ils existent,

00:47:42.010 --> 00:47:43.960
la racaille," and all this
stuff.

00:47:43.960 --> 00:47:47.119
It was just pas possible.
How did this happen?

00:47:47.119 --> 00:47:51.106
What happened is that the
people unwanted by the center

00:47:51.106 --> 00:47:55.241
were--and Haussmann was part of
this--rejected toward the

00:47:55.241 --> 00:47:58.302
outside where,
with the dilapidation of

00:47:58.302 --> 00:48:02.130
American center cities--a good
part of Philadelphia,

00:48:02.130 --> 00:48:04.107
most of Detroit,
New Orleans,

00:48:04.107 --> 00:48:08.275
San Francisco and Beacon Hill,
and we can find exceptions to

00:48:08.275 --> 00:48:12.159
that--but the pattern is just
completely different.

00:48:12.159 --> 00:48:16.162
You had the Viennese Army
firing large shells at the

00:48:16.162 --> 00:48:20.322
working class suburbs,
at the working-class housing on

00:48:20.322 --> 00:48:23.449
the outside of the city.
It's just the opposite.

00:48:23.449 --> 00:48:26.332
When you think of suburbs you
don't just think of Darien or

00:48:26.332 --> 00:48:28.320
you don't just think of Grosse
Pointe,

00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:32.401
or Hillsborough,
California, or very fancy

00:48:32.401 --> 00:48:36.397
places in other places.
But it's very different,

00:48:36.397 --> 00:48:39.850
and the pattern is just the
opposite, just an incredible

00:48:39.850 --> 00:48:42.590
difference.
One can exaggerate this too

00:48:42.590 --> 00:48:46.309
much, but these spatial tensions
count for something,

00:48:46.309 --> 00:48:50.642
and the margins of urban life
in France, and particularly

00:48:50.642 --> 00:48:55.207
around Paris were really--the
periphery became the domain of

00:48:55.207 --> 00:48:59.849
people who really couldn't
afford to live in the center.

00:48:59.849 --> 00:49:02.625
And that's an increasing
problem in Paris today is one

00:49:02.625 --> 00:49:05.820
neighborhood after another
becomes more and more expensive.

00:49:05.820 --> 00:49:08.090
Now it's the^( )eleventh and
twelfth are out of control,

00:49:08.090 --> 00:49:09.659
the^( )thirteenth is out of
control.

00:49:09.659 --> 00:49:12.115
And three million people may
live in Paris,

00:49:12.115 --> 00:49:15.506
but you've got another eight
thousand people living in this

00:49:15.506 --> 00:49:18.546
urban agglomeration,
and creating these attempted

00:49:18.546 --> 00:49:21.469
cities that are going to be
magnets of their own;

00:49:21.469 --> 00:49:23.250
it's been an utter,
utter failure.

00:49:23.250 --> 00:49:25.409
But Haussmann was really part
of that.

00:49:25.409 --> 00:49:28.254
And people building factories
seek a labor force,

00:49:28.254 --> 00:49:30.862
they seek more space,
they want to have their

00:49:30.862 --> 00:49:33.530
factories outside of the customs
barrier,

00:49:33.530 --> 00:49:36.986
so they're not paying taxes on
what they bring in to use in

00:49:36.986 --> 00:49:39.872
their factory.
So, that's just a very short

00:49:39.872 --> 00:49:43.943
explanation for why European
cities, and European suburbs in

00:49:43.943 --> 00:49:46.288
particular,
the whole sense of a

00:49:46.288 --> 00:49:49.391
suburb--despite the kind of
pavillon of

00:49:49.391 --> 00:49:53.459
Saint-Remy-les-Chevreuse and
places like that in the sort of

00:49:53.459 --> 00:49:56.700
wealthier parts of the Parisian
periphery,

00:49:56.700 --> 00:49:59.995
there's still a contrast there.
And even the image when you

00:49:59.995 --> 00:50:01.855
say, in French you say,
you come from the

00:50:01.855 --> 00:50:04.598
quatre-vingt-treize,
you come from ninety-three,

00:50:04.598 --> 00:50:07.494
that means Seine-Saint-Denis,
and that--for them that's the

00:50:07.494 --> 00:50:10.140
image of the ninety-three
license plate is that of the

00:50:10.140 --> 00:50:13.093
periphery,
of people who are thought to be

00:50:13.093 --> 00:50:16.481
marginal by the center.
But, as I've argued in other

00:50:16.481 --> 00:50:19.904
places, including some of my own
writing, the sense of not

00:50:19.904 --> 00:50:23.687
belonging to the center creates
a type of solidarity that helped

00:50:23.687 --> 00:50:26.210
the communists in the 1920s and
'30s,

00:50:26.210 --> 00:50:29.731
and hopefully helped people,
as the government has undercut

00:50:29.731 --> 00:50:33.557
the attempts of suburban people
to create voluntary associations

00:50:33.557 --> 00:50:36.289
that will offer hope to all
these people.

00:50:36.289 --> 00:50:38.724
Wait till you watch La
Haine, the film,

00:50:38.724 --> 00:50:41.659
later on, it's incredible.
Well, some of this starts with

00:50:41.659 --> 00:50:43.891
Haussmann.
We went a long way today,

00:50:43.891 --> 00:50:47.726
from the Alsatian Attila all
the way to Clichy-sous-Bois,

00:50:47.726 --> 00:50:50.034
two years ago.
But I hope that the larger

00:50:50.034 --> 00:50:53.111
points were clear.
And from that we move on to

00:50:53.111 --> 00:50:57.180
imperialism on Monday,
have a fantastic weekend.

00:50:57.180 --> 00:50:58.180
See ya.

00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:07.771
Prof: We'll continue the
discussion we left open last

00:00:07.771 --> 00:00:08.630
time.
 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:14.430
Remember we are--we were saying
a few things about Ulysses.

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:22.130
The overarching question of my
remarks--

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:27.660
and your questions actually
took my remarks in a different

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.900
and sometimes deeper direction
than I had intended--

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:39.420
is the whole issue of Ulysses
but around Ulysses,

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:47.290
Dante's reading of what we call
the Hellenic world.

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:54.920
Around Ulysses--Ulysses
is--appears in Canto XXVI with

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.520
Diomedes who is silent.
 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:04.102
Ulysses, the polytropic
intelligence of classic

00:01:04.102 --> 00:01:08.311
antiquity,
the crafty mind is--he appears

00:01:08.311 --> 00:01:12.763
as a philosopher,
but also as a rhetorician and

00:01:12.763 --> 00:01:18.524
this is exactly that kind of
complicity between the two modes

00:01:18.524 --> 00:01:21.500
that Dante wants to explore.
 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.519
Let me continue with this
overarching theme.

00:01:24.519 --> 00:01:29.870
The overarching theme is the
reading of the Greek world.

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.080
You remember that we saw
Eteocles and Polyneices,

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:38.373
that clearly for Dante is--the
knowledge of which is filtered

00:01:38.373 --> 00:01:43.644
through a Greek Roman poet,
Statius, who was born and lived

00:01:43.644 --> 00:01:46.269
in a Greek Roman city,
Naples.

00:01:46.269 --> 00:01:51.294
So he's discussing through
Eteocles and Polyneices the

00:01:51.294 --> 00:01:53.569
whole story of Thebes.
 

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:56.420
The two brothers,
who are enemies,

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.307
the enemies-brothers,
and therefore the tragic

00:02:00.307 --> 00:02:04.540
history, the tragic knot of
Theban mythology.

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:11.079
It is Diomedes who is silent
and--but above all the focus of

00:02:11.079 --> 00:02:16.400
the canto falls on the greatness
of this hero.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.019
Ulysses, who I repeat,
plays a pivotal role in Dante's

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:22.240
imagination.
 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.860
He is a paradigm,
he has a paradigmatic role.

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:31.473
Dante can't quite get enough of
him, nor can he get over the

00:02:31.473 --> 00:02:33.940
phantasm of Ulysses.
 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.554
Ulysses literally appears in
his dreams in Canto XIX of

00:02:37.554 --> 00:02:40.479
Purgatorio,
and then Ulysses will also

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:44.104
appear when Dante has to measure
the great imaginative distance

00:02:44.104 --> 00:02:47.554
that he traveled when he's at
the border of the physical and

00:02:47.554 --> 00:02:49.250
the metaphysical worlds.
 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.560
He looks back and he will see
Ulysses,

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.282
or he'll remember--he will see
the place which has been the

00:02:56.282 --> 00:03:00.512
place of Ulysses' transgression,
because this is apparently

00:03:00.512 --> 00:03:01.580
Ulysses' sin.
 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:06.973
Ulysses' sin is to have
counseled his companions to go

00:03:06.973 --> 00:03:10.740
beyond the boundaries of
knowledge.

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:15.128
This is--so,
it's the effects of counseling.

00:03:15.128 --> 00:03:17.813
Let me just say one thing,
that for Dante there's no

00:03:17.813 --> 00:03:19.710
figure which is more
interesting,

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:23.341
more important,
more full of--for whom he has

00:03:23.341 --> 00:03:27.550
so many questions than the
figure of the counsel.

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:32.659
A counsel was of course Pier
della Vigna, how does he advise?

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:34.319
How does he take the pressure?
 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:36.758
He's the secretary, the counsel.
 

00:03:36.758 --> 00:03:38.788
How does he take the pressure
of the court?

00:03:38.788 --> 00:03:44.520
What does he counsel Frederick
the Great, his emperor?

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.360
And then we're going to see
other counsels.

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.223
We're going to find very soon,
later today,

00:03:49.223 --> 00:03:53.044
a ProvenÃ§al poet who
literally advises war between

00:03:53.044 --> 00:03:54.340
father and son.
 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.650
He divides father from son.
 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.032
He breaches the unity of the
body politic and we'll come to

00:04:01.032 --> 00:04:03.449
that in Inferno XXVIII.
 

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:07.295
Ulysses is the counsel who--he
gives the wrong counsel to his

00:04:07.295 --> 00:04:08.128
companions.
 

00:04:08.128 --> 00:04:12.528
He makes rhetorical promises
which he knows he cannot quite

00:04:12.528 --> 00:04:13.060
keep.
 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.624
They are grand questions,
but are--what questions does he

00:04:17.624 --> 00:04:20.069
pass on to these companions?
 

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:24.259
What he says is,
after the captivity,

00:04:24.259 --> 00:04:26.980
after they're being in bondage
to Circe,

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:30.439
he wants to reform them--the
companions--

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:32.944
who as you know,
are caught into the story that

00:04:32.944 --> 00:04:35.829
Dante may have read in medieval
accounts with Ulysses:

00:04:35.829 --> 00:04:38.170
they had been metamorphosed
into hogs,

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:40.550
into pigs, into Epicureans.
 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:45.319
They had yielded to the
pleasures of sensual happiness,

00:04:45.319 --> 00:04:48.940
the sensual understanding of
happiness.

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:51.903
He says, "you were not
made," this is part of the

00:04:51.903 --> 00:04:54.050
speech that he makes to his
companions,

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:56.790
"you were not made to live
as beasts,"

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:59.928
an illusion to Circe,
to Circe's metamorphosis,

00:04:59.928 --> 00:05:02.815
"but to pursue,
to follow virtue and

00:05:02.815 --> 00:05:03.970
knowledge."
 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:07.860
This is grandiose advice that
he gives.

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.055
Grandiose advice,
but which has one little

00:05:11.055 --> 00:05:15.175
problem that Dante places him--
and that's not necessarily the

00:05:15.175 --> 00:05:18.125
major problem--
he places Ulysses and his

00:05:18.125 --> 00:05:21.870
companions as they are going to
go beyond,

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:24.629
as they are going beyond the
Pillars of Hercules.

00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:28.850
It is as if Dante implies and
seems to agree with,

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:31.185
if one were to read the
trajectory of the Divine

00:05:31.185 --> 00:05:33.930
Comedy,
that there is no knowledge

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:38.593
worthy of its name unless it is
connected to some degree of

00:05:38.593 --> 00:05:39.959
transgression.
 

00:05:39.959 --> 00:05:43.495
That somehow transgression is
part of knowing,

00:05:43.495 --> 00:05:46.089
of an original and new knowing.
 

00:05:46.089 --> 00:05:50.403
Ulysses has to go beyond the
limits of the known world in

00:05:50.403 --> 00:05:54.331
order to truly uncover,
discover something anew that

00:05:54.331 --> 00:05:55.949
nobody else knew.
 

00:05:55.949 --> 00:05:58.161
That makes him,
as they used to say,

00:05:58.161 --> 00:06:01.069
a Renaissance figure avant
la lettre;

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:02.050
that's the way he's known.
 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:04.620
There is the famous joke of
Ulysses,

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:09.276
and the graduate paper refers
to Ulysses as the great hero who

00:06:09.276 --> 00:06:13.934
is with one foot firmly rooted
in the Middle Ages and with the

00:06:13.934 --> 00:06:17.798
other one,
he salutes the rising sun of

00:06:17.798 --> 00:06:19.449
the Renaissance.
 

00:06:19.449 --> 00:06:23.730
It's a little bit of a comical
account of Ulysses but it gives

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:27.449
you a sense of how--the novelty
that he represents.

00:06:27.449 --> 00:06:30.810
There is this bit of a
transgression,

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:34.319
but Dante doesn't seem to be
terribly bothered by it,

00:06:34.319 --> 00:06:37.430
since he himself,
in the different circumstances,

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:42.053
is engaged in exactly the same
kind of transgression of the

00:06:42.053 --> 00:06:43.009
perimeter.
 

00:06:43.009 --> 00:06:46.057
Apparently the geographic,
even the cosmic,

00:06:46.057 --> 00:06:48.670
perimeter, he goes beyond the
sun.

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:52.800
He's even--he even goes farther
than Daedalus and certainly

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:55.649
farther than Icarus:
these other mythical

00:06:55.649 --> 00:06:57.430
coordinates with him.
 

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:02.194
How does Dante find out--how
does he want us to know that

00:07:02.194 --> 00:07:06.959
somehow the promises Ulysses
makes to his companions--

00:07:06.959 --> 00:07:10.209
he wants to lead them to virtue
of knowledge--

00:07:10.209 --> 00:07:12.709
may really be a faulty promise.
 

00:07:12.709 --> 00:07:17.019
This is, I think,
the substance of the canto.

00:07:17.019 --> 00:07:21.134
Dante will refer to it with a
famous metaphor as a "mad

00:07:21.134 --> 00:07:22.180
flight."
 

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:24.860
Remember Ulysses recounts how
they made--

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:29.252
a mad flight out of the oars,
mixing metaphors as Dante had

00:07:29.252 --> 00:07:33.661
done before--
the maritime journey and the

00:07:33.661 --> 00:07:35.180
air journey.
 

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:37.605
This is the journey,
the flight of the mind,

00:07:37.605 --> 00:07:40.709
the flight of the intellect as
if it were described by a

00:07:40.709 --> 00:07:43.480
sailor;
Ulysses is a sailor.

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:48.060
How does Dante make us aware
that this is indeed--there is

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:52.079
madness in what Ulysses is
trying to accomplish?

00:07:52.079 --> 00:07:55.529
Very simply,
he puts him within a peculiar,

00:07:55.529 --> 00:07:59.475
distinct political and
rhetorical context so that you

00:07:59.475 --> 00:08:03.192
really have to wonder:
can he really deliver these

00:08:03.192 --> 00:08:07.288
promises and what are the
political consequences of the

00:08:07.288 --> 00:08:09.490
promises that he makes?
 

00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:16.062
The whole Canto XXVI is
literally littered with fallen

00:08:16.062 --> 00:08:17.180
cities.
 

00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:19.670
From this point through it
begins with Troy--

00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:23.377
I'm sorry with Florence--Dante
has this apostrophe against the

00:08:23.377 --> 00:08:25.810
city of Florence:
the city of Thebes,

00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:28.826
that's what he calls it,
spreading its wings as if it

00:08:28.826 --> 00:08:31.771
were also--
as if cities were like heroes,

00:08:31.771 --> 00:08:33.668
engaged in great flights.
 

00:08:33.668 --> 00:08:39.034
That is a clear desire on
Dante's part to have us connect

00:08:39.034 --> 00:08:43.058
the story of Ulysses'
self-degradation,

00:08:43.058 --> 00:08:46.879
turpitude, with the story of
Ulysses,

00:08:46.879 --> 00:08:51.450
Florence's turpitude and
Ulysses' own fall.

00:08:51.450 --> 00:08:53.610
Then there is a reference to
the city of Troy,

00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:54.379
a fallen city.
 

00:08:54.379 --> 00:08:58.048
There is a reference to Thebes
with--through Eteocles and

00:08:58.048 --> 00:08:58.899
Polyneices.
 

00:08:58.899 --> 00:09:02.168
There is also a reference to
Rome.

00:09:02.168 --> 00:09:06.951
The canto is full of references
to cities from this point of

00:09:06.951 --> 00:09:07.519
view.
 

00:09:07.519 --> 00:09:12.615
Canto XXVI is a version--a
brief version--of the epic,

00:09:12.615 --> 00:09:17.808
because the impulse of the epic
is always political.

00:09:17.808 --> 00:09:21.030
There is no epic that you can
think of which doesn't think

00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:23.662
about--
it's not trying to represent

00:09:23.662 --> 00:09:27.905
the--either the falling cities
and the edification of new

00:09:27.905 --> 00:09:30.219
cities,
or for that matter,

00:09:30.219 --> 00:09:34.190
some locating of a city that
could be in a great,

00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:35.759
grand metaphysical drama.
 

00:09:35.759 --> 00:09:41.542
It could be in the heavenly
Jerusalem, or it's Rome,

00:09:41.542 --> 00:09:44.830
it's Carthage,
it's Thebes.

00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:49.751
Falling cities and rising
cities: so this is the strategy

00:09:49.751 --> 00:09:50.720
of Dante.
 

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:56.202
Dante's strategy is to show
then how the grand philosophical

00:09:56.202 --> 00:10:01.591
claims of Ulysses have effects
that make it appear as empty

00:10:01.591 --> 00:10:02.798
rhetoric.
 

00:10:02.798 --> 00:10:07.644
Dante places Ulysses nowhere,
somewhere in the ocean without

00:10:07.644 --> 00:10:09.370
a particular place.
 

00:10:09.370 --> 00:10:12.248
He goes from one city to
another, and at the same time

00:10:12.248 --> 00:10:15.128
because of this,
he can never quite--doesn't

00:10:15.128 --> 00:10:18.690
seem to be able to deliver on
what he has promised.

00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:23.081
It's a reflection on one
particular aspect of the tragic

00:10:23.081 --> 00:10:24.600
story of Ulysses.
 

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:29.827
It's the tragedy of language:
a language that contains with

00:10:29.827 --> 00:10:33.975
itself all the most incredible
mirages and yet,

00:10:33.975 --> 00:10:36.678
it falls short of reality.
 

00:10:36.678 --> 00:10:42.110
Ulysses is literally placed in
the empty ocean away from all

00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:45.610
responsibilities and all
locations,

00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:52.570
and it is this gratuitousness
of his quest that also counts

00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:58.570
for his being in Hell among the
evil counselors.

00:10:58.570 --> 00:11:03.236
This is what I was trying to
tell you last time and I think

00:11:03.236 --> 00:11:08.388
that I have added on today a few
other details but we can go back

00:11:08.388 --> 00:11:11.928
to that if there is to be a
discussion,

00:11:11.928 --> 00:11:14.000
and I hope there will be,
a little later.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:20.687
Let me turn now to Canto XXVII
which I really like to read in

00:11:20.687 --> 00:11:24.192
conjunction--
it should be read in

00:11:24.192 --> 00:11:28.981
conjunction with Canto XXVI,
because here we have what I

00:11:28.981 --> 00:11:32.840
would call a counter myth to the
story of Ulysses.

00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:38.147
There is a contraction of focus;
there's even a revision of the

00:11:38.147 --> 00:11:43.100
claims of epic grandeur that we
have in Canto XXVI.

00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:45.840
Dante meets,
and he's the one to become the

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:48.870
interlocutor of,
Guido da Montefeltro,

00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:52.822
an extraordinary figure,
a political leader,

00:11:52.822 --> 00:11:56.706
that's what he was,
who then experienced the

00:11:56.706 --> 00:11:57.690
conversion.
 

00:11:57.690 --> 00:12:02.528
He became a Franciscan friar
and historically--

00:12:02.528 --> 00:12:06.457
this is a historical
figure--historically he is

00:12:06.457 --> 00:12:09.789
called in by the Pope Boniface
VIII,

00:12:09.789 --> 00:12:11.200
by now you know him.
 

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:14.543
He's not someone that Dante
really holds in the highest

00:12:14.543 --> 00:12:17.981
esteem possible,
but Boniface VIII,

00:12:17.981 --> 00:12:24.267
in an inversion of the
relations between priest and

00:12:24.267 --> 00:12:27.684
cleric,
high priest and cleric,

00:12:27.684 --> 00:12:31.490
asks Guido da Montefeltro for
some advice.

00:12:31.490 --> 00:12:35.964
We are dealing again with evil
counselors and the advice is the

00:12:35.964 --> 00:12:40.251
following: you have to teach me,
you are a great man of arms,

00:12:40.251 --> 00:12:44.559
you have to tell me what is--
what are the strategies I

00:12:44.559 --> 00:12:48.820
should pursue in order to
conquer Palestrina,

00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:50.370
a small town.
 

00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:53.364
You may know it as a place
of--the origin of a great

00:12:53.364 --> 00:12:56.298
musician from there,
but a small town near Rome.

00:12:56.298 --> 00:12:59.899
I want to conquer and destroy
the city of Palestrina;

00:12:59.899 --> 00:13:02.830
you tell me how I am to do this.
 

00:13:02.830 --> 00:13:07.951
We're really dealing with a
Machiavellian world of

00:13:07.951 --> 00:13:09.308
counselors.
 

00:13:09.308 --> 00:13:13.770
For Machiavelli,
it's actually the language of

00:13:13.770 --> 00:13:17.440
Machiavelli avant la
lettre.

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:21.783
Machiavelli uses,
takes the language I think that

00:13:21.783 --> 00:13:24.678
Guido will deploy for himself.
 

00:13:24.678 --> 00:13:28.590
At one point Guido says,
my works were those of--

00:13:28.590 --> 00:13:32.769
not of a lion but of a fox,
and you remember,

00:13:32.769 --> 00:13:36.940
these are the two attributes in
The Prince of Machiavelli

00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:40.371
that the man--
the perfect prince ought to

00:13:40.371 --> 00:13:40.899
have.
 

00:13:40.899 --> 00:13:43.711
That is to say,
the perfect prince is the one

00:13:43.711 --> 00:13:47.610
who knows how to use strength,
but how to use also slyness.

00:13:47.610 --> 00:13:50.538
You have to know when you have
to be crafty and foxy.

00:13:50.538 --> 00:13:55.610
You have to know when to be
violent and lion-like.

00:13:55.610 --> 00:13:58.928
Two images that clearly
originate from Cicero.

00:13:58.928 --> 00:14:03.325
They are not Dante's own
invention but--and it's likely

00:14:03.325 --> 00:14:08.046
that Machiavelli got them from
Cicero, as well as from this

00:14:08.046 --> 00:14:08.860
canto.
 

00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:13.149
The connections between the two
cantos are several.

00:14:13.149 --> 00:14:16.980
Let me just go--first of all,
it begins--

00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:20.610
Canto XXVII--there is this
reference to the Sicilian bull,

00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:26.129
clearly a counter to the Trojan
horse of the previous canto.

00:14:26.129 --> 00:14:28.229
"As the Sicilian bull
which bellowed for the first

00:14:28.229 --> 00:14:30.458
time--
and it was just--with a cry of

00:14:30.458 --> 00:14:32.889
him who had shaped it with his
file,

00:14:32.889 --> 00:14:36.672
used to bellow with a voice of
the victim so though it was of

00:14:36.672 --> 00:14:38.547
brass,
and yet it seemed pierced with

00:14:38.547 --> 00:14:39.113
pain; thus...
 

00:14:39.113 --> 00:14:39.679
" etc.
 

00:14:39.679 --> 00:14:40.990
What is the story?
 

00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:46.379
It's exactly the same version,
a demotic, vulgar version of

00:14:46.379 --> 00:14:51.490
the great situation--of what has
happened to Ulysses.

00:14:51.490 --> 00:14:56.994
Ulysses is condemned to be held
prisoner of the flames and the

00:14:56.994 --> 00:15:00.576
two tongues of fire,
literally tongues of fire,

00:15:00.576 --> 00:15:03.956
because here is a rhetorician,
the philosopher,

00:15:03.956 --> 00:15:08.730
the neo-Platonist who actually
is a rhetorician,

00:15:08.730 --> 00:15:14.168
trying to persuade others about
his ideas,

00:15:14.168 --> 00:15:22.440
and managing,
and being very proud of this--

00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:25.447
his success,
but then he gets caught by his

00:15:25.447 --> 00:15:26.379
own tongue.
 

00:15:26.379 --> 00:15:30.038
It's always the temptation of
the artist himself,

00:15:30.038 --> 00:15:34.840
it's Daedalus who builds the
labyrinth and gets caught by it.

00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:38.227
It's the story of the artist
who becomes a captive of that

00:15:38.227 --> 00:15:40.250
which he himself is constructed.
 

00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:43.980
This is true for Ulysses,
a rhetorician caught by his own

00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:46.464
language,
and here Dante begins with a

00:15:46.464 --> 00:15:50.577
story of the Sicilian bull,
the first victim of which was

00:15:50.577 --> 00:15:52.129
the artist itself.
 

00:15:52.129 --> 00:15:57.628
So I think it's literally a way
of reflecting on the scene that

00:15:57.628 --> 00:15:58.870
precedes it.
 

00:15:58.870 --> 00:16:02.125
Virgil and Dante are
interrupted, line 20:

00:16:02.125 --> 00:16:06.892
"O thou to whom I direct
my voice and who now just spoke

00:16:06.892 --> 00:16:08.558
in Lombard."
 

00:16:08.558 --> 00:16:13.054
What an extraordinary little
misreading of the language,

00:16:13.054 --> 00:16:17.058
of the rhetoric deployed in the
previous canto.

00:16:17.058 --> 00:16:20.984
You remember in the previous
canto, Dante has Virgil go out

00:16:20.984 --> 00:16:25.111
of his way to say don't talk to
these people--they are Greeks,

00:16:25.111 --> 00:16:26.940
so let me talk to them.
 

00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:32.466
But now from the perspective of
Guido da Montefeltro--they are

00:16:32.466 --> 00:16:36.634
not speaking some kind of
Homeric, Attic Greek,

00:16:36.634 --> 00:16:40.259
they're speaking a dialect of
Italy.

00:16:40.259 --> 00:16:43.573
Which is to say,
that language--it's not a

00:16:43.573 --> 00:16:47.130
question of what kind of style
you are using,

00:16:47.130 --> 00:16:50.769
language always shows a sort of
distance.

00:16:50.769 --> 00:16:55.966
It shows you yourself where you
are and the kind of distance

00:16:55.966 --> 00:16:59.580
that you have from the world of
truth,

00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:03.283
or the kind of proximity that
you may have to some

00:17:03.283 --> 00:17:06.759
self-complacency,
as in the case of Ulysses.

00:17:06.759 --> 00:17:07.701
"You who ...
 

00:17:07.701 --> 00:17:08.809
now spoke Lombard...
 

00:17:08.809 --> 00:17:11.470
" Clearly a way of reading
the pretence--

00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:15.188
the rhetorical stylistic
pretensions of the other two

00:17:15.188 --> 00:17:18.118
speakers in the previous canto
saying,

00:17:18.118 --> 00:17:20.680
"Now go thy way,
I do not urge thee more,

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:22.598
though I have come,
perhaps, somewhat late,

00:17:22.598 --> 00:17:25.200
let it not irk thee to stay and
speak with me;

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:28.038
thou seest that it irks not me,
and I am burning.

00:17:28.038 --> 00:17:30.917
If thou hast fallen but now
into this blind world from the

00:17:30.917 --> 00:17:33.827
sweet land of Italy,
whence I bring all my guilt,

00:17:33.827 --> 00:17:36.700
tell me if the Romagnoles have
peace or war,

00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:39.520
for I was of the mountains
there between Urbino and the

00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:41.558
height where Tiber is
released."

00:17:41.558 --> 00:17:46.832
As opposed to the lofty
rhetoric of Ulysses in the

00:17:46.832 --> 00:17:51.123
previous canto,
who speaks through the grandest

00:17:51.123 --> 00:17:55.450
generalities about what is the
destination and destiny,

00:17:55.450 --> 00:17:58.608
and fate of human beings:
virtue, knowledge,

00:17:58.608 --> 00:18:01.509
the journey to the west,
going through a hundred

00:18:01.509 --> 00:18:02.618
thousand perils.
 

00:18:02.618 --> 00:18:05.875
Here the language
becomes--there's a sort of

00:18:05.875 --> 00:18:09.522
deliberate diminution,
a contraction of focus,

00:18:09.522 --> 00:18:13.259
as if the language becomes one
of indeed local,

00:18:13.259 --> 00:18:17.150
peace and war between
neighboring towns.

00:18:17.150 --> 00:18:19.230
"I was still bent down
and...

00:18:19.230 --> 00:18:20.048
" etc.
 

00:18:20.048 --> 00:18:23.576
And then, as a way of adjusting
the register,

00:18:23.576 --> 00:18:27.423
the stylistic register,
Virgil will say to Dante,

00:18:27.423 --> 00:18:30.788
"Speak thou;
he is Italian."

00:18:30.788 --> 00:18:34.883
Once again, on the surface,
the observance of degrees of

00:18:34.883 --> 00:18:39.571
style and the laws of rhetorical
decorum are always observed and

00:18:39.571 --> 00:18:41.953
now he continues:
"O soul...

00:18:41.953 --> 00:18:43.220
" etc.
 

00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:48.976
And he will--the pilgrim will
inform Guido da Montefeltro

00:18:48.976 --> 00:18:55.144
about the situation of Italy,
and this is the whole paragraph

00:18:55.144 --> 00:18:56.788
on page 337.
 

00:18:56.788 --> 00:19:00.968
And then Guido goes on saying,
"If I thought my answer

00:19:00.968 --> 00:19:04.568
were to one who would ever
return to the world,

00:19:04.568 --> 00:19:07.410
this flame should stay without
another movement.

00:19:07.410 --> 00:19:10.480
But since none ever returned
alive from this depth,

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:13.674
if what I hear is true,
I answer thee without fear of

00:19:13.674 --> 00:19:14.720
infamy."
 

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:17.779
This is a passage that most of
you remember very well;

00:19:17.779 --> 00:19:19.348
you may know this very well.
 

00:19:19.348 --> 00:19:22.911
It's a passage that Eliot,
T.S. Eliot,

00:19:22.911 --> 00:19:26.568
uses an epigraphy,
an epitaph actually,

00:19:26.568 --> 00:19:31.190
for "The Love Song of
Prufrock."

00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:35.974
So it gives you an idea of the
kind of reading that Eliot has

00:19:35.974 --> 00:19:40.867
of his own modest--
the solitary--this man Prufrock

00:19:40.867 --> 00:19:47.410
and the kind of infernal reality
that this figure also evokes.

00:19:47.410 --> 00:19:51.509
What I want to emphasize though
here, at the level of style,

00:19:51.509 --> 00:19:53.038
is how Guido speaks.
 

00:19:53.038 --> 00:19:59.710
Curses, hypothetical sentences,
parenthetical remarks,

00:19:59.710 --> 00:20:04.306
not just a style that
is--deliberately goes contrary

00:20:04.306 --> 00:20:08.243
to the smooth high--
once again high style of

00:20:08.243 --> 00:20:10.848
Ulysses in the preceding canto.
 

00:20:10.848 --> 00:20:14.928
Then, "I was a man of
arms, and then a corded friar,

00:20:14.928 --> 00:20:17.548
thinking, so girt,
to make amends;

00:20:17.548 --> 00:20:19.858
and indeed my thought had come
true,

00:20:19.858 --> 00:20:22.321
but for the Great Priest,"
here is the curse against

00:20:22.321 --> 00:20:24.210
Boniface,
"may ill befall him!--

00:20:24.210 --> 00:20:27.930
who put me back in the old
sins, and how and wherefore,

00:20:27.930 --> 00:20:30.640
I would have thee hear from me.
 

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:35.118
While I informed the bones and
flesh my mother gave me."

00:20:35.118 --> 00:20:39.809
Another reference to birth with
which, as you know,

00:20:39.809 --> 00:20:43.750
characters start telling us
their story.

00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:47.731
The making of birth,
the first major event of their

00:20:47.731 --> 00:20:52.828
lives and then whatever happens,
whatever biographical account

00:20:52.828 --> 00:20:57.449
may be a descent from or a
deviation from the promises that

00:20:57.449 --> 00:20:59.680
that birth may have held.
 

00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:02.368
"While I informed the
bones..."

00:21:02.368 --> 00:21:05.528
etc., "my deeds were those
not of the lion,

00:21:05.528 --> 00:21:07.210
but of the fox."
 

00:21:07.210 --> 00:21:09.054
This is
Machiavellian--eventually will

00:21:09.054 --> 00:21:10.650
become Machiavellian language.
 

00:21:10.650 --> 00:21:14.410
We are moving into the secret
halls of power.

00:21:14.410 --> 00:21:18.510
There where big deals are
struck, big deals of the

00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:22.612
destruction of cities,
where the pope will ask the

00:21:22.612 --> 00:21:25.710
secret advice from his
counselor.

00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:26.818
Let's see what he says.
 

00:21:26.818 --> 00:21:30.443
"I knew all wiles and
covert ways and so practice

00:21:30.443 --> 00:21:31.880
their arts..."
 

00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:37.319
I cannot but remark to you how
Canto XXVI also takes place

00:21:37.319 --> 00:21:42.380
through the language of
concealment and covertness.

00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:46.683
Even which is--in Italian it's
actually the language for

00:21:46.683 --> 00:21:50.990
thievery at the same time,
the furtiveness of it all.

00:21:50.990 --> 00:21:54.970
You remember Dante speaks of
the sun through a periphrasis,

00:21:54.970 --> 00:21:58.874
to say that it was hidden,
that sinners are hidden and

00:21:58.874 --> 00:22:02.190
concealed from view in the
tongues of fire.

00:22:02.190 --> 00:22:05.760
This is the language of
manipulation of the political

00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:10.019
stratagems and machinations and
here it becomes highlighted and

00:22:10.019 --> 00:22:11.599
made visible to us.
 

00:22:11.599 --> 00:22:15.298
He continues the covert ways.
 

00:22:15.298 --> 00:22:19.270
"When I saw myself come to
that part of my life where every

00:22:19.270 --> 00:22:22.296
man should lower their
sails," as if he were

00:22:22.296 --> 00:22:26.001
another mariner like Ulysses,
"and gather in the ropes

00:22:26.001 --> 00:22:28.750
that which before had pleased me
then grieved me,

00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:34.308
and with repentance and
confession I turned friar and--

00:22:34.308 --> 00:22:37.368
woe is me!--it would have
served.

00:22:37.368 --> 00:22:41.417
The prince of the new
Pharisees--being at war near the

00:22:41.417 --> 00:22:44.548
Lateran and not with Saracens or
Jews,

00:22:44.548 --> 00:22:48.226
for every one of his enemies
was Christian and none had been

00:22:48.226 --> 00:22:52.088
at the taking of Acre or trading
in the land of the Soldan--

00:22:52.088 --> 00:22:55.972
regarded neither the supreme
office and holy orders in

00:22:55.972 --> 00:22:58.753
himself,
nor in me, that cord which used

00:22:58.753 --> 00:23:02.700
to make its wearers lean;
but as Constantine..."

00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:06.891
It's really--we are moving
within the--I said within the

00:23:06.891 --> 00:23:11.234
halls of--we say the Vatican
today, but at the time it was

00:23:11.234 --> 00:23:12.530
the Church of St.
 

00:23:12.530 --> 00:23:16.113
John the Lateran,
which was the residence of the

00:23:16.113 --> 00:23:17.788
Bishop of Rome.
 

00:23:17.788 --> 00:23:22.294
And it was famous then as it is
famous now, for the mosaics

00:23:22.294 --> 00:23:26.098
about Constantine's Donation to
Pope Sylvester.

00:23:26.098 --> 00:23:33.006
The whole issue of the temporal
power of the papacy really is to

00:23:33.006 --> 00:23:39.473
be seen--it's to be glimpsed
through this scene of Guido and

00:23:39.473 --> 00:23:40.900
Boniface.
 

00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:44.202
"He asked counsel of me,
and I was silent,

00:23:44.202 --> 00:23:48.078
for his words seemed drunken;
and then he spoke again."

00:23:48.078 --> 00:23:53.481
This is the extraordinary
caricature of the holy office,

00:23:53.481 --> 00:23:58.787
giving the absolution before
even the commission of the

00:23:58.787 --> 00:23:59.769
crime.
 

00:23:59.769 --> 00:24:02.441
You can go and do what you
want, I give you absolution

00:24:02.441 --> 00:24:05.061
before you do anything,
so it's, "Do not let thy

00:24:05.061 --> 00:24:07.727
heart mistrust;
I absolve thee henceforth,

00:24:07.727 --> 00:24:11.798
and do thou teach me how I may
cast Palestrina to the ground.

00:24:11.798 --> 00:24:14.279
I have power to lock and
unlock,"

00:24:14.279 --> 00:24:18.328
the new Peter,
"Heaven, as thou knowest,

00:24:18.328 --> 00:24:24.545
for the keys are two which my
predecessor did not hold

00:24:24.545 --> 00:24:26.068
dear."
 

00:24:26.068 --> 00:24:29.920
This is the famous story of
Celestine V,

00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:33.971
who gave up the office of the
papacy and who stands even in

00:24:33.971 --> 00:24:38.094
the historical recollections and
scholarship of today as the

00:24:38.094 --> 00:24:42.461
embodiment of one of a pope,
of a figure who understood that

00:24:42.461 --> 00:24:45.788
the drama and the issue is
always between power,

00:24:45.788 --> 00:24:48.250
maybe a little bit too
dualistically,

00:24:48.250 --> 00:24:52.078
and holiness and how the two
for Celestine were really

00:24:52.078 --> 00:24:54.680
incommensurable and cannot
quite--

00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:59.019
there could not be a dialectic
between the two and he gave up.

00:24:59.019 --> 00:25:05.034
Dante refers to him with a
little bit of harshness for not

00:25:05.034 --> 00:25:09.991
being heroic enough and
withstanding the tide of

00:25:09.991 --> 00:25:16.640
corruption and deciding to
retreat to a contemplative life.

00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:20.000
"Then the weighty,"
let me continue--

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.119
this is a little sermon that I
apologize for,

00:25:22.119 --> 00:25:23.500
let me continue with this."
 

00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:26.781
Then the weighty arguments
drove me to the point where

00:25:26.781 --> 00:25:30.186
silence seemed to me the worst
offense and I said,"

00:25:30.186 --> 00:25:33.717
and this is the advice he
gives: simple and spectacular in

00:25:33.717 --> 00:25:36.009
its simplicity,
"Father,

00:25:36.009 --> 00:25:40.371
since thou dost cleanse me from
this sin into which I must now

00:25:40.371 --> 00:25:43.588
fall," I love the "I
must."

00:25:43.588 --> 00:25:46.935
I cannot--I find it so
irresistible especially because

00:25:46.935 --> 00:25:50.535
now I am guaranteed of this
absolution, I can really go on

00:25:50.535 --> 00:25:52.240
and do whatever I want.
 

00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:56.242
So there is not just a coercion
on Guido, but a kind of pleasure

00:25:56.242 --> 00:25:57.259
that he feels.
 

00:25:57.259 --> 00:26:00.530
He feels now that it is a
necessity for him to go out and

00:26:00.530 --> 00:26:03.416
perpetrate--
and commit the evil he will

00:26:03.416 --> 00:26:07.858
perpetrate and this is the
advice: "Large promise with

00:26:07.858 --> 00:26:12.990
scant observance will make thee
triumph in the lofty seat."

00:26:12.990 --> 00:26:14.278
What is he saying?
 

00:26:14.278 --> 00:26:17.380
Make promises and plan not to
keep them.

00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:20.442
Go and tell the people in
Palestrina that you are going to

00:26:20.442 --> 00:26:22.807
respect them,
that you are going to make them

00:26:22.807 --> 00:26:25.278
even rich, whatever you want to
tell them.

00:26:25.278 --> 00:26:28.371
Then of course,
as soon as they open the gates

00:26:28.371 --> 00:26:31.670
of the city, don't keep any of
these promises.

00:26:31.670 --> 00:26:37.940
This is the--a restatement by
the way that one--

00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:43.763
that finds its original source
in Cicero's text about rhetoric

00:26:43.763 --> 00:26:48.699
which is known as--
it's not really Cicero's but it

00:26:48.699 --> 00:26:53.328
was thought to be Cicero's and
this is the text.

00:26:53.328 --> 00:27:00.536
From the person to whom it was
dedicated, it was meant for this

00:27:00.536 --> 00:27:02.278
Ad Herrenium.
 

00:27:02.278 --> 00:27:06.328
It was thought in the Middle
Ages to be Cicero's rhetorical

00:27:06.328 --> 00:27:09.890
treatises and the rhetorical
treatises is based--

00:27:09.890 --> 00:27:14.222
all treaties--like many other
treatises are based on one

00:27:14.222 --> 00:27:18.163
premise,
that rhetoric is the art of

00:27:18.163 --> 00:27:25.335
making the city and the citizens
agree in order to keep the city

00:27:25.335 --> 00:27:26.358
going.
 

00:27:26.358 --> 00:27:33.021
In a properly governed city
promises are made and are always

00:27:33.021 --> 00:27:35.618
going to be observed.
 

00:27:35.618 --> 00:27:40.130
It's a way of explaining
rhetoric in moral terms.

00:27:40.130 --> 00:27:43.690
What Dante's saying is those
kind of dictates,

00:27:43.690 --> 00:27:47.351
those kinds of propositions can
easily be turned around and they

00:27:47.351 --> 00:27:49.849
are being turned around in the
practice,

00:27:49.849 --> 00:27:50.798
the historical practice.
 

00:27:50.798 --> 00:27:53.380
"Then, as soon as I was
dead,

00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:56.117
Francis came for me,"
there is a little rivalry

00:27:56.117 --> 00:28:00.638
between Francis and the devil,
fighting over the soul of Guido

00:28:00.638 --> 00:28:05.567
and Guido is--
Francis loses and Guido is,

00:28:05.567 --> 00:28:08.900
of course, here in Hell.
 

00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:13.742
I mention these details because
you will see that Dante will

00:28:13.742 --> 00:28:17.930
pick up this genre of medieval
disputation when--

00:28:17.930 --> 00:28:21.931
later in Purgatorio--in
a couple of weeks we'll hit the

00:28:21.931 --> 00:28:24.490
canto where Dante meets Guido's
son,

00:28:24.490 --> 00:28:29.468
because in this poem fathers
and sons do not necessarily

00:28:29.468 --> 00:28:34.626
belong in the same moral space
and sons do not necessarily

00:28:34.626 --> 00:28:38.700
follow in the footsteps of their
fathers.

00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:42.709
So you will see how Dante
echoes this whole scene and this

00:28:42.709 --> 00:28:44.818
is a kind of pre-figuration.
 

00:28:44.818 --> 00:28:47.490
I'm giving you a pre-figuration
of things to come.

00:28:47.490 --> 00:28:52.085
Then we come--and I really want
to pay a little bit of attention

00:28:52.085 --> 00:28:56.388
to this Canto XXVIII because
we're entering the world of the

00:28:56.388 --> 00:29:00.214
truly tragic world,
the tragic--the most tragic

00:29:00.214 --> 00:29:03.058
section of the Divine
Comedy.

00:29:03.058 --> 00:29:07.940
And I mention that because from
here to Canto XXXIII,

00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:11.713
the story of Ugolino,
we're going to talk about what

00:29:11.713 --> 00:29:15.711
does Dante think of tragedy and
how can he go on really

00:29:15.711 --> 00:29:17.710
envisioning the tragic.
 

00:29:17.710 --> 00:29:20.730
After all, I just called the
poem, as he calls it,

00:29:20.730 --> 00:29:21.410
a comedy.
 

00:29:21.410 --> 00:29:24.048
What is the role and the place
of the tragic?

00:29:24.048 --> 00:29:28.528
Is there room for the tragic
vision in Dante's comedy?

00:29:28.528 --> 00:29:32.919
The point is that the tragic--I
want to make this point now and

00:29:32.919 --> 00:29:36.460
I will be elaborating it as we
go on next time--

00:29:36.460 --> 00:29:40.840
especially next time--the
tragic is never the final

00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:41.630
vision.
 

00:29:41.630 --> 00:29:45.673
I will go on even saying
something now that the essence

00:29:45.673 --> 00:29:48.970
of tragedy is always linguistic
for Dante.

00:29:48.970 --> 00:29:55.138
It has to do with issues of the
inherent ambiguities of

00:29:55.138 --> 00:29:58.442
language,
the impossibility of decoding

00:29:58.442 --> 00:30:02.108
and deciphering what is being
said by one particular--

00:30:02.108 --> 00:30:05.130
by one statement as opposed to
another.

00:30:05.130 --> 00:30:08.390
Here Dante begins then with a
reflection about tragedy.

00:30:08.390 --> 00:30:09.539
Where are we now?
 

00:30:09.539 --> 00:30:15.251
We are in Canto XXVIII;
it's the--Dante encounters the

00:30:15.251 --> 00:30:20.255
one figure,
the figure of Bertran de Born

00:30:20.255 --> 00:30:26.703
who was a ProvenÃ§al poet,
a ProvenÃ§al poet whom

00:30:26.703 --> 00:30:29.269
Dante actually admires greatly.
 

00:30:29.269 --> 00:30:32.490
In the treaties on language
that he writes,

00:30:32.490 --> 00:30:34.390
this famous--I have been
referring to it,

00:30:34.390 --> 00:30:37.480
De vulgari eloquentia,
he singles him out as--

00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:41.915
Dante singles out Bertran de
Born as a great poet because he

00:30:41.915 --> 00:30:45.299
knew how to write the most
difficult genre.

00:30:45.299 --> 00:30:48.415
He was ProvenÃ§al poet,
you know who they are--the area

00:30:48.415 --> 00:30:51.588
of Provence,
wedged between the Ligurian

00:30:51.588 --> 00:30:57.250
part of Italy and France--
because he was such a great

00:30:57.250 --> 00:31:03.868
poet, because he knew how to
rhyme and write war poems.

00:31:03.868 --> 00:31:07.438
This is really the most
difficult type of poetry,

00:31:07.438 --> 00:31:12.048
aesthetically very difficult to
sustain and Bertran de Born was

00:31:12.048 --> 00:31:13.608
a genius at this.
 

00:31:13.608 --> 00:31:20.288
Now Dante places him among the
so-called makers of discord.

00:31:20.288 --> 00:31:23.348
This is Canto XXVIII,
Bertran de Born.

00:31:23.348 --> 00:31:27.470
Let's see how--Dante starts
with a reflection of war.

00:31:27.470 --> 00:31:29.568
I want to tell you a couple of
things.

00:31:29.568 --> 00:31:34.068
This is a canto,
a difficult canto.

00:31:34.068 --> 00:31:40.648
Dante begins with the story of
by--with a reference to

00:31:40.648 --> 00:31:46.980
ineffability--would you please
read the passages?

00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:51.548
I--my version is--my English
version--from Canto XXVIII,

00:31:51.548 --> 00:31:54.288
the first paragraph,
who could?

00:31:54.288 --> 00:31:57.545
Yes, do you want to do
this--would you like to do it

00:31:57.545 --> 00:31:58.118
please?
 

00:31:58.118 --> 00:31:59.407
Student:  Sure.
 

00:31:59.407 --> 00:32:02.747
"Who could ever tell,
even with words untrammeled and

00:32:02.747 --> 00:32:05.911
the tale often repeated,
of all the blood in the wounds

00:32:05.911 --> 00:32:06.788
I saw now?
 

00:32:06.788 --> 00:32:10.904
Surely every tongue would fail,
for our speech and memory have

00:32:10.904 --> 00:32:13.470
not the capacity to take in so
much.

00:32:13.470 --> 00:32:16.873
Were all the people assembled
again who once in the fateful

00:32:16.873 --> 00:32:19.666
land of Apulia,
bewailed their blood shed by

00:32:19.666 --> 00:32:23.512
the Trojans and in the long war
which made the high-piled spoil

00:32:23.512 --> 00:32:26.630
of rings--
as Livy writes who does not

00:32:26.630 --> 00:32:31.765
err--with those who suffered
grievous strokes in the struggle

00:32:31.765 --> 00:32:36.986
with Robert Guiscard and those
others whose bones are still in

00:32:36.986 --> 00:32:41.950
heaps at Ceperano where every
Apulian was faithless,

00:32:41.950 --> 00:32:46.439
and there by Tagliacozzo,
where old Alardo conquered

00:32:46.439 --> 00:32:49.173
without arms;
and were one to show his

00:32:49.173 --> 00:32:52.651
wounded limb and another his cut
off, it would be nothing to

00:32:52.651 --> 00:32:56.069
compare with the foul fashion of
the ninth ditch."

00:32:56.069 --> 00:32:57.180
Prof: Very well read.
 

00:32:57.180 --> 00:32:59.089
Thank you so much, excellent.
 

00:32:59.089 --> 00:33:01.230
What is this metaphor?
 

00:33:01.230 --> 00:33:08.740
It's the--we could call it the
adoption of the so-called

00:33:08.740 --> 00:33:11.608
ineffability topos.
 

00:33:11.608 --> 00:33:13.608
You understand what I mean by
ineffability topos?

00:33:13.608 --> 00:33:17.368
That is to say,
usually it's a device,

00:33:17.368 --> 00:33:22.871
a poetic device,
where the poet admits the

00:33:22.871 --> 00:33:26.076
difficulty,
or even impossibility of

00:33:26.076 --> 00:33:27.900
describing a particular reality.
 

00:33:27.900 --> 00:33:29.410
It's called ineffability.
 

00:33:29.410 --> 00:33:32.907
It's so sublime;
it usually has to do with,

00:33:32.907 --> 00:33:35.259
let's say, the vision of God.
 

00:33:35.259 --> 00:33:37.618
I cannot really go on:
whoever has seen God,

00:33:37.618 --> 00:33:39.779
whatever mystic may have had a
vision,

00:33:39.779 --> 00:33:44.519
they always fall into the
contingency,

00:33:44.519 --> 00:33:49.338
the facticity of language that
cannot quite grasp the sublime

00:33:49.338 --> 00:33:51.990
quality of what they have seen.
 

00:33:51.990 --> 00:33:57.613
Dante now deploys the same
device for the world of--let's

00:33:57.613 --> 00:34:01.730
call it for what it is,
the evil world.

00:34:01.730 --> 00:34:05.348
It is as if Hell now has its
own sublimity,

00:34:05.348 --> 00:34:10.557
a sublime quality that is a
parallel and counter to that

00:34:10.557 --> 00:34:16.429
which Dante will witness in the
divine spectacles at the top of

00:34:16.429 --> 00:34:17.659
Paradise.
 

00:34:17.659 --> 00:34:23.246
This is the first thing;
language cannot quite be

00:34:23.246 --> 00:34:27.530
adequate to the reality it wants
to represent.

00:34:27.530 --> 00:34:32.123
What he's talking about now is
all the--he wants to describe

00:34:32.123 --> 00:34:33.679
the whole of Hell.
 

00:34:33.679 --> 00:34:39.612
And all the limbs,
the dismemberments of bodies

00:34:39.612 --> 00:34:47.222
from old wars cannot quite come
close to what he has seen in

00:34:47.222 --> 00:34:50.059
this area of Hell.
 

00:34:50.059 --> 00:34:52.268
This is really the idea.
 

00:34:52.268 --> 00:34:55.760
What Dante first of all will go
on describing is--

00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:58.110
first of all then,
the question of the

00:34:58.110 --> 00:35:01.115
ineffability topos,
which we'll see what it means

00:35:01.115 --> 00:35:04.297
in the unfolding of the canto,
and let me just continue

00:35:04.297 --> 00:35:05.469
actually with this.
 

00:35:05.469 --> 00:35:09.494
Then the canto really comes to
a close with a meeting of

00:35:09.494 --> 00:35:11.909
a--with a poet Bertran de Born.
 

00:35:11.909 --> 00:35:17.958
So we go from the language of
the ineffable and a language of

00:35:17.958 --> 00:35:22.422
the ineffable that is--
has also this little detail,

00:35:22.422 --> 00:35:26.010
a reference to Livy,
a Roman historian.

00:35:26.010 --> 00:35:28.061
And his voice,
and his authority,

00:35:28.061 --> 00:35:29.280
are unquestioned.
 

00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:31.690
Livy cannot make mistakes.
 

00:35:31.690 --> 00:35:36.289
They are unerring in their
chronicles,

00:35:36.289 --> 00:35:38.309
in their accounts of what they
have seen,

00:35:38.309 --> 00:35:43.503
but somehow the poetic voice is
not quite the same thing as the

00:35:43.503 --> 00:35:45.179
historian's voice.
 

00:35:45.179 --> 00:35:51.054
You see what the tension is in
the first few lines of the poem,

00:35:51.054 --> 00:35:56.644
and then the canto comes to a
close with a different form of

00:35:56.644 --> 00:35:58.730
poetic reflection.
 

00:35:58.730 --> 00:36:04.340
Dante is here describing
something altogether different,

00:36:04.340 --> 00:36:07.139
the meeting of Bertran de Born,
and look how this scene--

00:36:07.139 --> 00:36:12.309
this is the end of Canto
XXVIII: "I stayed to watch

00:36:12.309 --> 00:36:17.293
the troop and saw a thing I
should fear simply to tell

00:36:17.293 --> 00:36:20.960
without more proof,"
another,

00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:24.409
the threat of the ineffable
once again.

00:36:24.409 --> 00:36:28.489
The poet is unable to
represent--feels the difficulty

00:36:28.489 --> 00:36:32.960
of representing that--the
extraordinary quality of what he

00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:33.980
has seen.
 

00:36:33.980 --> 00:36:34.572
"..
 

00:36:34.572 --> 00:36:38.865
.but that conscience reassures
me, the good companion which

00:36:38.865 --> 00:36:42.418
emboldens a man under the
breastplate of his felt

00:36:42.418 --> 00:36:43.530
integrity.
 

00:36:43.530 --> 00:36:49.849
Verily I saw,
and I seem to see it still,

00:36:49.849 --> 00:36:55.340
a trunk without a head,
going as were the others of the

00:36:55.340 --> 00:37:00.166
miserable herd,
and it held the severed head by

00:37:00.166 --> 00:37:03.061
the hair,
swinging in its hand like a

00:37:03.061 --> 00:37:06.809
lantern,
and that was looking at us and

00:37:06.809 --> 00:37:08.960
saying: 'Woe is me!'
 

00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:15.385
Of itself it made for itself a
lamp, and they were two in one,

00:37:15.385 --> 00:37:17.809
and one in two."
 

00:37:17.809 --> 00:37:22.092
Strangely mathematical
language, the divided body of

00:37:22.092 --> 00:37:25.702
Bertran de Born:
he's a maker of discord and

00:37:25.702 --> 00:37:30.237
he's being punished by having
his own body divided from

00:37:30.237 --> 00:37:31.329
itself.
 

00:37:31.329 --> 00:37:35.811
I'll come back to this metaphor
in a moment, but the idea for

00:37:35.811 --> 00:37:40.219
now stylistically is that the
two is one, and one is two;

00:37:40.219 --> 00:37:44.440
"how it can be He knows
who so ordains."

00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:49.340
A mathematical language,
as if there is no equality even

00:37:49.340 --> 00:37:50.320
possible.
 

00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:52.518
Remember that was exactly the
language that he was--

00:37:52.518 --> 00:37:57.054
he used for the metaphor,
the impossible metaphor to

00:37:57.054 --> 00:37:59.876
contain all--
the description of all the

00:37:59.876 --> 00:38:03.367
battlefields and all the dead
people at the beginning of Canto

00:38:03.367 --> 00:38:03.940
XXVIII.
 

00:38:03.940 --> 00:38:08.079
I cannot find a metaphor that
somehow can equal,

00:38:08.079 --> 00:38:11.456
can give an idea,
a fair idea,

00:38:11.456 --> 00:38:18.677
a proportionate idea of what I
have seen in these bodies one on

00:38:18.677 --> 00:38:23.380
top of the other,
limbs accumulated one on top of

00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:24.139
the other.
 

00:38:24.139 --> 00:38:28.907
And now Dante's using again the
language of a quantity but sort

00:38:28.907 --> 00:38:33.597
of making us think that somehow
there is some equality or some

00:38:33.597 --> 00:38:37.289
rationale in the disparity of
one being two.

00:38:37.289 --> 00:38:39.217
I don't know,
he says, but He knows,

00:38:39.217 --> 00:38:40.760
God knows, who so ordains.
 

00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:42.452
I don't know,
that's what the statement

00:38:42.452 --> 00:38:42.809
means.
 

00:38:42.809 --> 00:38:44.760
"When it was just below
the bridge,

00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:49.371
it raised its arm high,
and with it the head so as to

00:38:49.371 --> 00:38:53.273
bring its words near us,"
and they were:

00:38:53.273 --> 00:38:57.000
"See now my grievous
punishment,

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:00.130
thou who, breathing,
goest looking on the dead;

00:39:00.130 --> 00:39:04.530
see if any other is so great as
this."

00:39:04.530 --> 00:39:10.014
Clearly, this is the first
character in Hell who complains

00:39:10.014 --> 00:39:15.402
that the punishment inflicted on
him is really beyond all

00:39:15.402 --> 00:39:18.768
justice, beyond all proportion.
 

00:39:18.768 --> 00:39:22.235
And there's no proportionality
between what the punishment he

00:39:22.235 --> 00:39:24.429
gets and the crime he has
committed.

00:39:24.429 --> 00:39:28.416
And he proceeds to explain:
"And, that thou mayst bear

00:39:28.416 --> 00:39:32.130
news of me, know that I am
Bertran de Born.

00:39:32.130 --> 00:39:36.900
He that gave evil backing to
the Young King."

00:39:36.900 --> 00:39:39.438
And he explains,
"I made rebellion between

00:39:39.438 --> 00:39:42.400
the father and the son;
I divided father and son;

00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:46.865
Ahithophel did no worse,"
a biblical typology,

00:39:46.865 --> 00:39:51.780
"for Absalom and David
with his wicked goadings.

00:39:51.780 --> 00:39:56.135
Because I parted those so
joined I carry my brain,

00:39:56.135 --> 00:39:59.960
alas, parted from its root in
this trunk;

00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:03.739
thus is observed in me the
retribution."

00:40:03.739 --> 00:40:05.639
What is going on here?
 

00:40:05.639 --> 00:40:07.409
It's a number of things.
 

00:40:07.409 --> 00:40:09.719
Let me just explain a few
things.

00:40:09.719 --> 00:40:14.824
Why should the Bertran de Born,
the poet, be the one who bears

00:40:14.824 --> 00:40:19.510
now visible, the mark of the
division on his own body?

00:40:19.510 --> 00:40:22.670
We know that this is the way
punishments occur.

00:40:22.670 --> 00:40:25.911
The idea of a punishment in
Hell is that a punishment is

00:40:25.911 --> 00:40:29.565
just usually the prolongation of
what the extension of what one

00:40:29.565 --> 00:40:31.570
has chosen to do in this life.
 

00:40:31.570 --> 00:40:38.141
You choose to create division
and it means that that's where

00:40:38.141 --> 00:40:39.590
you belong.
 

00:40:39.590 --> 00:40:42.898
You did not believe in the
mortality of the soul and you

00:40:42.898 --> 00:40:46.510
are always after death you are
going to be dead and so on.

00:40:46.510 --> 00:40:51.463
This is the reflection on
punishment, or if you wish,

00:40:51.463 --> 00:40:57.273
on the justice that regulates
this world of Hell or what Dante

00:40:57.273 --> 00:40:59.750
calls the retribution.
 

00:40:59.750 --> 00:41:03.981
The word he uses is,
in Italian, contrapasso,

00:41:03.981 --> 00:41:08.630
means a counterpart I would
say, or counter suffering.

00:41:08.630 --> 00:41:13.114
The last word in Italian is
contrapasso which really

00:41:13.114 --> 00:41:16.440
means that there
is--passo comes from

00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:18.219
passion, to suffer.
 

00:41:18.219 --> 00:41:22.820
You suffer equally for what you
have done, that's it.

00:41:22.820 --> 00:41:25.672
It's--in a sense it's really
the--not quite,

00:41:25.672 --> 00:41:29.521
but the equivalent of the eye
for the eye and the tooth for

00:41:29.521 --> 00:41:30.449
the tooth.
 

00:41:30.449 --> 00:41:36.063
The whole idea of retributive
justice: there is a fair

00:41:36.063 --> 00:41:42.737
correspondence between what you
have done and what you are going

00:41:42.737 --> 00:41:44.219
to suffer.
 

00:41:44.219 --> 00:41:49.353
And Bertran de Born seems to
do--why, what is the issue with

00:41:49.353 --> 00:41:50.309
the body?
 

00:41:50.309 --> 00:41:54.976
The whole point of this canto
is that Bertran de Born divides

00:41:54.976 --> 00:41:56.300
father and son.
 

00:41:56.300 --> 00:41:59.777
He violates a principle
of--fundamental principle of

00:41:59.777 --> 00:42:01.210
political theology.
 

00:42:01.210 --> 00:42:05.369
Whereby, if some of you are
interested in this issue,

00:42:05.369 --> 00:42:07.869
you can read the work of a
historian,

00:42:07.869 --> 00:42:11.369
a great medieval historian who
died actually almost half a

00:42:11.369 --> 00:42:15.239
century ago: it's The King's
Two Bodies by a historian by

00:42:15.239 --> 00:42:16.960
the name of Kantorowicz.
 

00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:27.289
Some of you may know it.
 

00:42:27.289 --> 00:42:29.099
What is the idea of the king?
 

00:42:29.099 --> 00:42:31.050
What do you mean by the king's
two bodies?

00:42:31.050 --> 00:42:36.061
Yes, a king has always two
bodies, the visible body that

00:42:36.061 --> 00:42:40.800
one has and also the mystical
body of the royalty.

00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:45.032
They used to say in the Middle
Ages, and we still do maybe,

00:42:45.032 --> 00:42:49.121
if you are into the news about
royalty: the king is dead,

00:42:49.121 --> 00:42:50.800
long live the king.
 

00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:53.030
The king never dies.
 

00:42:53.030 --> 00:42:55.929
The king never dies because he
has always two bodies;

00:42:55.929 --> 00:42:57.639
there are two bodies of the
king.

00:42:57.639 --> 00:43:02.722
I may die as an incumbent but
the office of the king always

00:43:02.722 --> 00:43:05.440
remains, this is fundamental.
 

00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:06.949
That's one idea.
 

00:43:06.949 --> 00:43:11.574
So, by dividing the father from
the son, Dante has Bertran de

00:43:11.574 --> 00:43:16.199
Born breaching the unity of the
mystical body of the king.

00:43:16.199 --> 00:43:18.179
The two, father and son,
are really one.

00:43:18.179 --> 00:43:21.010
The other metaphor that is
behind it,

00:43:21.010 --> 00:43:26.230
which we already saw a little
bit--sort of traced,

00:43:26.230 --> 00:43:30.722
finally traced in the canto of
Ciacco in Canto VI of

00:43:30.722 --> 00:43:35.920
Inferno was the idea of
the body politic that you may

00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:38.739
remember I mentioned to you.
 

00:43:38.739 --> 00:43:42.780
The famous fable of Menenius,
who thinks that the body,

00:43:42.780 --> 00:43:47.594
the city is really constructed
like a body: an organic set of

00:43:47.594 --> 00:43:50.811
correspondences,
organic correspondences like

00:43:50.811 --> 00:43:51.780
the human body.
 

00:43:51.780 --> 00:43:55.023
There's no difference
between--there is a difference

00:43:55.023 --> 00:43:57.250
between patricians and
plebeians.

00:43:57.250 --> 00:44:01.688
That's Menenius' argument,
but they're all part of one

00:44:01.688 --> 00:44:03.699
organic unified whole.
 

00:44:03.699 --> 00:44:07.164
That is true for the body
politic, from a Roman point of

00:44:07.164 --> 00:44:11.007
view, but it's the principle of
so-called mystical body of the

00:44:11.007 --> 00:44:11.699
Church.
 

00:44:11.699 --> 00:44:14.889
Saint Paul, in the Letter to
the Ephesians,

00:44:14.889 --> 00:44:18.554
refers to the Church as the
mystical body of Christ a kind

00:44:18.554 --> 00:44:20.998
of--
so that the State becomes a

00:44:20.998 --> 00:44:24.329
secular counter,
a secular extension of this

00:44:24.329 --> 00:44:25.420
mystical body.
 

00:44:25.420 --> 00:44:28.652
The Church, we are all members,
some of us thumbs,

00:44:28.652 --> 00:44:30.766
other are just toes,
or whatever,

00:44:30.766 --> 00:44:34.659
hair or whatever in this body,
mystical body of Christ.

00:44:34.659 --> 00:44:40.304
I mention this because Canto
XXVIII you have a political

00:44:40.304 --> 00:44:43.327
focus on Rome,
or Bertran de Born,

00:44:43.327 --> 00:44:47.228
breaching the unity of father
and son but also reference to

00:44:47.228 --> 00:44:51.465
Mohammed and I know there are a
lot of people who just find this

00:44:51.465 --> 00:44:55.500
just absolutely odious that
Mohammed should be placed,

00:44:55.500 --> 00:44:59.579
the prophet should be placed
here in this area of Inferno.

00:44:59.579 --> 00:45:02.420
The only argument that one can
have about this,

00:45:02.420 --> 00:45:06.434
is that, for Dante,
Mohammed was actually a member

00:45:06.434 --> 00:45:09.550
of the Church who created a
schism,

00:45:09.550 --> 00:45:11.329
which is different from heresy.
 

00:45:11.329 --> 00:45:14.679
We saw the heretics in Cantos
IX and X.

00:45:14.679 --> 00:45:19.173
The heretics are those who do
not believe in certain tenets of

00:45:19.173 --> 00:45:20.280
the doctrine.
 

00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:22.827
The schismatics are those who
want to double,

00:45:22.827 --> 00:45:23.579
who divide.
 

00:45:23.579 --> 00:45:26.657
The word "schism"
in Greek means to tear apart

00:45:26.657 --> 00:45:29.400
the unity, the world of unity,
and doubling it.

00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:37.818
So this is really the argument,
the symbols and images of Canto

00:45:37.818 --> 00:45:39.039
XXVIII.
 

00:45:39.039 --> 00:45:42.268
Let me go to the actual heart
of this problem,

00:45:42.268 --> 00:45:46.719
the question of justice and the
question of Bertran de Born.

00:45:46.719 --> 00:45:48.239
We will go back to that.
 

00:45:48.239 --> 00:45:50.699
"When I was just below the
bridge...

00:45:50.699 --> 00:45:53.902
See now my grievous punishment,
thou who, breathing,

00:45:53.902 --> 00:45:57.231
goest looking on the dead;
see if any other is so great as

00:45:57.231 --> 00:45:57.840
this."
 

00:45:57.840 --> 00:46:03.027
Bertran thinks that there is no
justice in this hellish world

00:46:03.027 --> 00:46:04.670
that he inhabits.
 

00:46:04.670 --> 00:46:08.041
All the ideas that the
Ethics of Aristotle

00:46:08.041 --> 00:46:11.764
really account for devices that
are so prevalent here,

00:46:11.764 --> 00:46:13.380
it's just not true.
 

00:46:13.380 --> 00:46:17.289
Not only that's not true,
this idea of the retribution--

00:46:17.289 --> 00:46:18.945
is it an idea,
this idea of the

00:46:18.945 --> 00:46:22.414
contrapasso,
is that an idea that Dante

00:46:22.414 --> 00:46:24.150
really believes in?
 

00:46:24.150 --> 00:46:27.307
There is a lot of--what kind of
justice is that--what are the

00:46:27.307 --> 00:46:29.518
justices that we have in
Inferno?

00:46:29.518 --> 00:46:33.068
Let me just give you a little
bit of--a piece of intellectual

00:46:33.068 --> 00:46:35.018
history about this whole issue.
 

00:46:35.018 --> 00:46:37.601
I want to make it very simple,
because it's really not a

00:46:37.601 --> 00:46:38.869
difficult problem anyway.
 

00:46:38.869 --> 00:46:42.929
It's not that I'm simplifying
the issue,

00:46:42.929 --> 00:46:46.530
it's--there are two types:
the people who think that the--

00:46:46.530 --> 00:46:50.760
the thinkers who think about
this issue and of course,

00:46:50.760 --> 00:46:52.739
Aristotle in the Ethics.
 

00:46:52.739 --> 00:46:56.465
And Dante's aware of the great
commentary on Aristotle's

00:46:56.465 --> 00:46:58.768
Ethics by Thomas Aquinas.
 

00:46:58.768 --> 00:47:04.181
He keeps them in mind and they
discuss justice and they wonder

00:47:04.181 --> 00:47:05.780
what is justice.
 

00:47:05.780 --> 00:47:08.969
This is a great problem for
Dante, because Dante is--I have

00:47:08.969 --> 00:47:12.215
been calling him a number of
things, but he's clearly a poet

00:47:12.215 --> 00:47:13.039
of justice.
 

00:47:13.039 --> 00:47:16.445
He really believes the whole
point of his quest is to

00:47:16.445 --> 00:47:19.590
establish some degree of justice
in his soul,

00:47:19.590 --> 00:47:22.010
try to find out justice in the
city,

00:47:22.010 --> 00:47:27.530
and probe the possibility of
some universal justice,

00:47:27.530 --> 00:47:31.853
as opposed to Lucretian ideas
of anarchy and chaos in the

00:47:31.853 --> 00:47:32.550
cosmos.
 

00:47:32.550 --> 00:47:35.615
So there can be some continuity
between the outside and the

00:47:35.615 --> 00:47:36.409
inside world.
 

00:47:36.409 --> 00:47:37.860
What is the idea of justice?
 

00:47:37.860 --> 00:47:39.820
What main types of justice do
they have?

00:47:39.820 --> 00:47:42.659
They usually think about two
types of justice.

00:47:42.659 --> 00:47:48.074
The so called--the retributive
justice which is the one that we

00:47:48.074 --> 00:47:52.530
have in Hell here,
but also distributive justice.

00:47:52.530 --> 00:47:54.820
Is Dante--is Dante aware of the
two?

00:47:54.820 --> 00:47:58.300
Yes, it's impossible not to
think of the representation of

00:47:58.300 --> 00:48:01.110
the Wheel of Fortune in
Inferno VII,

00:48:01.110 --> 00:48:04.389
as anything less than a case of
distributive justice.

00:48:04.389 --> 00:48:08.500
The distributive justice
follows an arithmetical model.

00:48:08.500 --> 00:48:11.043
That is to say,
in a distributive justice,

00:48:11.043 --> 00:48:14.210
as imagined in the Wheel of
Fortune, some have more,

00:48:14.210 --> 00:48:15.389
some have less.
 

00:48:15.389 --> 00:48:17.463
If someone has five,
you want to establish some

00:48:17.463 --> 00:48:20.228
justice,
you take away from one who has

00:48:20.228 --> 00:48:23.480
five and give to one who has
zero or one,

00:48:23.480 --> 00:48:25.239
and you create some kind of
equality.

00:48:25.239 --> 00:48:30.409
Distributive justice has
equality as its aim.

00:48:30.409 --> 00:48:34.518
In retributive justice,
things are a little bit

00:48:34.518 --> 00:48:39.407
different because if I say--
and Aquinas reflects on this,

00:48:39.407 --> 00:48:42.760
this is not a concern at all of
Aristotle--

00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:46.909
if I say an eye for an eye,
and a tooth for a tooth,

00:48:46.909 --> 00:48:51.121
am I really establishing
justice or am I just doubling

00:48:51.121 --> 00:48:54.300
the offense that has been
perpetrated?

00:48:54.300 --> 00:48:57.869
If I--someone takes an eye,
plucks an eye out of me,

00:48:57.869 --> 00:49:01.449
if I do the same to whoever has
damaged me that way,

00:49:01.449 --> 00:49:05.137
am I having--am I being
restored in my original

00:49:05.137 --> 00:49:06.019
position?
 

00:49:06.019 --> 00:49:09.179
No, that doesn't happen.
 

00:49:09.179 --> 00:49:14.637
So how do you--how does one go
around thinking about the whole

00:49:14.637 --> 00:49:17.679
question of retributive justice?
 

00:49:17.679 --> 00:49:20.780
Aquinas, and this also
Aristotle, who goes on thinking,

00:49:20.780 --> 00:49:23.639
he says, well of course it's
always very difficult to find

00:49:23.639 --> 00:49:26.150
exact counterparts between crime
and punishment.

00:49:26.150 --> 00:49:31.271
If a clown were to slap the
king, it's not enough for the

00:49:31.271 --> 00:49:35.846
king to slap the clown back
because, one might say,

00:49:35.846 --> 00:49:37.949
well, its one slap.
 

00:49:37.949 --> 00:49:42.780
There is the violation of the
office and then both Aristotle,

00:49:42.780 --> 00:49:45.139
that is implied,
and it can never quite be

00:49:45.139 --> 00:49:48.018
restored by having the king slap
the clown back.

00:49:48.018 --> 00:49:52.639
Both Aristotle and Aquinas say
that's why money was invented,

00:49:52.639 --> 00:49:55.096
so one can really give
whatever, there is a principle

00:49:55.096 --> 00:49:57.746
of inequality,
one can go on repaying it

00:49:57.746 --> 00:50:00.699
through other forms,
other punishments.

00:50:00.699 --> 00:50:03.300
The fact is,
I think, that Dante--first of

00:50:03.300 --> 00:50:06.789
all, I want to go back to the
structure of the canto.

00:50:06.789 --> 00:50:11.096
It's crucial that Dante should
think about this fundamental

00:50:11.096 --> 00:50:15.699
problem of justice which is the
aim of the ethical structure of

00:50:15.699 --> 00:50:18.670
the poem,
in Inferno in particular,

00:50:18.670 --> 00:50:22.300
through the poet,
through Bertran de Born.

00:50:22.300 --> 00:50:26.192
Not only through the poet,
it's Dante himself who has just

00:50:26.192 --> 00:50:29.675
been announcing the
impossibility of finding through

00:50:29.675 --> 00:50:33.489
language the exact metaphor,
the exact correspondence

00:50:33.489 --> 00:50:36.219
between a reality and its
representation.

00:50:36.219 --> 00:50:41.956
What Dante is doing,
is telling us how arbitrary are

00:50:41.956 --> 00:50:48.208
his own judgments in Hell,
how the notion of a position in

00:50:48.208 --> 00:50:53.702
the way punishments and crimes
are related are never quite

00:50:53.702 --> 00:50:54.860
reliable.
 

00:50:54.860 --> 00:50:58.925
This is the--to understand
this, and I know that I did not

00:50:58.925 --> 00:51:03.043
ask you to read it for today,
but I have to--I have a few

00:51:03.043 --> 00:51:07.021
minutes and I want to go the--
ask you to turn to the very

00:51:07.021 --> 00:51:10.559
beginning of Canto XXIX because
I think it becomes a

00:51:10.559 --> 00:51:14.789
retrospective gloss here on the
problems that I've been trying

00:51:14.789 --> 00:51:17.010
to explain in Canto XXVIII.
 

00:51:17.010 --> 00:51:20.610
Dante goes through other forms
of--

00:51:20.610 --> 00:51:24.389
he will enter the world of the
so-called alchemists,

00:51:24.389 --> 00:51:28.789
those who are engaged in
diabolical mutations,

00:51:28.789 --> 00:51:32.030
unnatural mutations,
personifications,

00:51:32.030 --> 00:51:34.516
impersonators,
disguises, etc.,

00:51:34.516 --> 00:51:39.949
but before he gets there,
there is a little long passage.

00:51:39.949 --> 00:51:43.974
It's the first time in the
whole poem that usually you know

00:51:43.974 --> 00:51:46.585
how--
what the narrative economy of

00:51:46.585 --> 00:51:49.137
each canto is,
Dante comes to the end of the

00:51:49.137 --> 00:51:51.213
poem--
of a canto and usually closes

00:51:51.213 --> 00:51:54.519
off with the particular sin or
the particular sinner,

00:51:54.519 --> 00:51:55.800
this is an exception.
 

00:51:55.800 --> 00:52:01.043
Dante goes into Canto XXIX and
whatever situation he has been

00:52:01.043 --> 00:52:05.239
describing in Canto XXVIII keeps
reappearing,

00:52:05.239 --> 00:52:07.384
it worries him and
somehow--well let's see what

00:52:07.384 --> 00:52:08.550
worries him about this.
 

00:52:08.550 --> 00:52:13.219
"The many people and the
strange wounds had made my eyes

00:52:13.219 --> 00:52:17.110
so drunken that they were fain
to stay and weep;

00:52:17.110 --> 00:52:20.597
but Virgil said to me:
'What are thou still gazing

00:52:20.597 --> 00:52:24.298
at?'" The pilgrim is
looking back at what he has

00:52:24.298 --> 00:52:24.940
seen.
 

00:52:24.940 --> 00:52:30.271
"Why does thy look still
rest down there among the

00:52:30.271 --> 00:52:32.840
miserable maimed shades?
 

00:52:32.840 --> 00:52:35.789
Thou hast not done this at the
other depths.

00:52:35.789 --> 00:52:39.375
Consider, if thou think to
number them, that the valley

00:52:39.375 --> 00:52:43.492
goes twenty-two miles round and
already the moon is beneath our

00:52:43.492 --> 00:52:44.090
feet.
 

00:52:44.090 --> 00:52:48.882
The time is now short that is
allowed to us and there is more

00:52:48.882 --> 00:52:51.760
to see than thou seest
here."

00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:56.449
Once again numbers,
arithmetical language.

00:52:56.449 --> 00:52:58.610
What is the measure?
 

00:52:58.610 --> 00:53:00.090
What is the--how do we measure?
 

00:53:00.090 --> 00:53:02.791
How are we going to determine
what is the exact

00:53:02.791 --> 00:53:03.789
correspondence?
 

00:53:03.789 --> 00:53:08.250
Let me just give you a little
aside about this.

00:53:08.250 --> 00:53:09.963
As you know,
a great reader of

00:53:09.963 --> 00:53:12.327
Inferno,
and actually he began his

00:53:12.327 --> 00:53:14.987
career as a commentator of
Dante, was Galileo,

00:53:14.987 --> 00:53:16.170
the scientist.
 

00:53:16.170 --> 00:53:21.757
That was the first work that he
did, he published a famous work

00:53:21.757 --> 00:53:23.559
on Inferno.
 

00:53:23.559 --> 00:53:28.632
He tried to find out what the
actual size of the whole of

00:53:28.632 --> 00:53:33.887
Inferno was, just by going by
this little detail that Dante

00:53:33.887 --> 00:53:35.880
gives, the radius.
 

00:53:35.880 --> 00:53:40.530
And he comes up with the idea
that Inferno is as large as the

00:53:40.530 --> 00:53:43.773
city of Florence,
which is something that he

00:53:43.773 --> 00:53:46.809
probably would have said anyway,
whether it was a

00:53:46.809 --> 00:53:49.523
mathematical--there was a
mathematical proof for it or

00:53:49.523 --> 00:53:50.599
just his own joke.
 

00:53:50.599 --> 00:53:52.480
I'll leave it to you to decide.
 

00:53:52.480 --> 00:53:53.780
Let me continue with this.
 

00:53:53.780 --> 00:53:58.143
"If thou hadst given heed
to my reason for looking,' I

00:53:58.143 --> 00:54:01.152
answered then,
'perhaps thou wouldst have

00:54:01.152 --> 00:54:03.409
granted me a longer stay.'
 

00:54:03.409 --> 00:54:08.489
Meantime the Leader was going
on and I went after him,

00:54:08.489 --> 00:54:11.684
already making my reply,
and I added:

00:54:11.684 --> 00:54:16.922
'Within that den where I held
my eyes so intently just now I

00:54:16.922 --> 00:54:20.829
think a spirit,"
a kinsmen of his,

00:54:20.829 --> 00:54:24.831
"one of my blood,
weeps for the guilt that cost

00:54:24.831 --> 00:54:26.949
so much down there."
 

00:54:26.949 --> 00:54:34.179
Dante knows that a relative of
his is in this den of Hell.

00:54:34.179 --> 00:54:36.952
"Then said the master:
'Let not thy thoughts be

00:54:36.952 --> 00:54:40.710
distracted about him henceforth;
attend to other things and let

00:54:40.710 --> 00:54:44.090
him stay there;
for I saw him below the bridge

00:54:44.090 --> 00:54:48.340
point at thee and threaten
fiercely with his finger,

00:54:48.340 --> 00:54:52.780
and I heard him called Geri del
Bello," reminding him,

00:54:52.780 --> 00:54:54.280
here I am.
 

00:54:54.280 --> 00:54:58.182
"Thou was so wholly
occupied with him who once held

00:54:58.182 --> 00:55:02.014
Hautefort that thou didst not
look that way till he was

00:55:02.014 --> 00:55:03.079
gone."
 

00:55:03.079 --> 00:55:06.079
Dante responds,
"'O my leader,' I said,

00:55:06.079 --> 00:55:11.556
'the violent death which is yet
unavenged for him by any that is

00:55:11.556 --> 00:55:15.469
a partner in his shame made him
indignant,

00:55:15.469 --> 00:55:18.893
and for that reason,
as I judge, he went on without

00:55:18.893 --> 00:55:22.931
speaking to me and by this he
has made me more compassionate

00:55:22.931 --> 00:55:25.699
with him.'"
What's going on?

00:55:25.699 --> 00:55:28.440
How is this related to the
previous canto?

00:55:28.440 --> 00:55:30.480
I think it's fairly clear.
 

00:55:30.480 --> 00:55:36.056
Dante meets a kinsmen of his
who has been killed and that

00:55:36.056 --> 00:55:41.532
death is unavenged and clearly
is going to be unavenged,

00:55:41.532 --> 00:55:44.820
is going to remain unavenged.
 

00:55:44.820 --> 00:55:48.719
Dante is so overwhelmed by pity
and compassion,

00:55:48.719 --> 00:55:51.943
but he does not say,
nor does he promise that he's

00:55:51.943 --> 00:55:55.760
going to go out and take revenge
against the killers of his

00:55:55.760 --> 00:55:57.670
relative, Geri del Bello.
 

00:55:57.670 --> 00:56:01.494
What he is doing,
he is redefining the notion of

00:56:01.494 --> 00:56:02.309
justice.
 

00:56:02.309 --> 00:56:07.833
The idea that justice is a
doubling, or could be,

00:56:07.833 --> 00:56:09.559
of the crime.
 

00:56:09.559 --> 00:56:12.206
Someone is doing something,
kills a kinsmen of mine,

00:56:12.206 --> 00:56:14.335
I'm going to go out and kill
your kinsmen,

00:56:14.335 --> 00:56:17.190
because that's the way justice
could be understood.

00:56:17.190 --> 00:56:21.324
The idea of justice as revenge,
as a way of establishing the

00:56:21.324 --> 00:56:24.898
precise relationship is what
Dante is giving up here

00:56:24.898 --> 00:56:25.949
completely.
 

00:56:25.949 --> 00:56:28.679
It's retrospectively a gloss on
what I have been saying,

00:56:28.679 --> 00:56:31.329
that the notion of justice as
the eye for the eye,

00:56:31.329 --> 00:56:36.141
or the tooth for the tooth,
is no longer valid in this

00:56:36.141 --> 00:56:37.050
context.
 

00:56:37.050 --> 00:56:43.155
I think this is the beginning
then of Dante's worrying about

00:56:43.155 --> 00:56:47.090
what is the nature of God's
justice.

00:56:47.090 --> 00:56:51.344
What is--how arbitrary is my
own claim of authority in

00:56:51.344 --> 00:56:55.597
describing these very issues,
and continuing with this

00:56:55.597 --> 00:56:58.889
reflection as we shall see next
time.

00:56:58.889 --> 00:57:02.737
Let me see if there are
questions now about this whole

00:57:02.737 --> 00:57:06.728
problem--the problems we have
been dealing with today or

00:57:06.728 --> 00:57:09.269
whatever problems you may have.
 

00:57:16.570 --> 00:57:19.070
Yes?
 

00:57:19.070 --> 00:57:23.197
Student:  I'm curious to
know, how knowledgeable Dante

00:57:23.197 --> 00:57:27.050
was of the Hellenic world since
he did not read Greek.

00:57:27.050 --> 00:57:31.737
Prof: The question is
how knowledgeable Dante was of

00:57:31.737 --> 00:57:35.699
the Hellenic world since he did
not read Greek.

00:57:35.699 --> 00:57:40.534
My answer is yes,
indeed, he did not read Greek

00:57:40.534 --> 00:57:41.480
at all.
 

00:57:41.480 --> 00:57:47.530
He--for that matter nor did
Aquinas really read Greek.

00:57:47.530 --> 00:57:53.597
So he knew the Hellenic world
through Latin translations of

00:57:53.597 --> 00:57:58.932
texts like Aristotle's was
being--the Ethics,

00:57:58.932 --> 00:58:02.699
the treatise On the
Soul.

00:58:02.699 --> 00:58:04.510
Plato, he knew.
 

00:58:04.510 --> 00:58:07.710
He knew medieval romances that
we'll be dealing with,

00:58:07.710 --> 00:58:11.969
the so-called medieval romances
deal with the matters of France,

00:58:11.969 --> 00:58:15.199
the matters of Rome,
the matters of Brittany,

00:58:15.199 --> 00:58:20.510
the Roman of Alexander which is
part of the Hellenic world.

00:58:20.510 --> 00:58:30.150
He knew the--he lived in
Ravenna which was part,

00:58:30.150 --> 00:58:34.427
by the way, until the year 1200
and more and later was part of

00:58:34.427 --> 00:58:37.155
the exarchy,
a Greek exarchy,

00:58:37.155 --> 00:58:42.289
the church of Ravenna
Exarchate, as it's called.

00:58:42.289 --> 00:58:50.121
So he knew this is where the
resources and the conduit of his

00:58:50.121 --> 00:58:54.170
knowledge of the Greek world.
 

00:58:54.170 --> 00:58:58.300
Latin, and whatever survives in
Latin, I mean for the

00:58:58.300 --> 00:59:01.320
philosophical schools of the
Greeks.

00:59:01.320 --> 00:59:05.090
Clearly Cicero on the ends of
man, De finibus,

00:59:05.090 --> 00:59:09.860
that is really the sourcebook
for whatever he--

00:59:09.860 --> 00:59:14.818
I've been saying about Stoics,
Epicureans, Aristotelians,

00:59:14.818 --> 00:59:15.349
etc.
 

00:59:15.349 --> 00:59:18.985
He had some idea,
Dante had some idea of the

00:59:18.985 --> 00:59:20.409
Metaphysics.
 

00:59:20.409 --> 00:59:25.014
He writes about in the
Convivio--he writes about

00:59:25.014 --> 00:59:29.960
the need to connect ethics and
metaphysics for instance.

00:59:29.960 --> 00:59:32.150
So he knew--that's what he knew.
 

00:59:32.150 --> 00:59:38.436
I could even add that I'm sure
that--Actually there is going to

00:59:38.436 --> 00:59:40.768
be in Washington D.C.
 

00:59:40.768 --> 00:59:42.775
in about a year,
we're going to have a

00:59:42.775 --> 00:59:43.480
conference.
 

00:59:43.480 --> 00:59:47.054
We're going to hold it in
Washington for a number of

00:59:47.054 --> 00:59:49.789
reasons, but on Dante and the
Greeks.

00:59:49.789 --> 00:59:53.139
So if you stay in touch with
me, I'll let you know what

00:59:53.139 --> 00:59:53.760
happens.
 

00:59:53.760 --> 00:59:56.500
One thing that we are really
looking at are the mosaics,

00:59:56.500 --> 00:59:59.215
the art world,
the relations,

00:59:59.215 --> 01:00:04.744
the connections with Greek
artists who have been traveling

01:00:04.744 --> 01:00:10.679
and were in Rome,
in Sicily--that's what he knew.

01:00:10.679 --> 01:00:13.340
Yes?
 

01:00:13.340 --> 01:00:17.394
Student:  Why is it
appropriate for Dante to move on

01:00:17.394 --> 01:00:21.590
contrapasso punishment
but for God to keep it in place

01:00:21.590 --> 01:00:22.429
in Hell?
 

01:00:22.429 --> 01:00:27.523
How does Dante reconcile those
two things that Hell is

01:00:27.523 --> 01:00:32.092
supposedly a just place,
but he's not supposed to look

01:00:32.092 --> 01:00:35.820
back towards like Canto XXVIII,
that he's not supposed to--

01:00:35.820 --> 01:00:40.230
Prof: The question is
going back to the problem of

01:00:40.230 --> 01:00:43.380
justice in Canto XXVIII and then
XXIX.

01:00:43.380 --> 01:00:48.652
How can Dante go on having some
kind of hesitations about the

01:00:48.652 --> 01:00:54.190
idea of justice and at the same
time hold the place in Hell,

01:00:54.190 --> 01:00:56.449
and plays according to some
criteria.

01:00:56.449 --> 01:01:02.860
The answer is--it will appear a
little bit complicated,

01:01:02.860 --> 01:01:07.730
but I'm not sure that it's
complicated.

01:01:07.730 --> 01:01:11.690
This whole language of doubts
about authority--

01:01:11.690 --> 01:01:15.875
that Dante is the authority of
himself as the one who can

01:01:15.875 --> 01:01:19.711
administer justice,
the authority about

01:01:19.711 --> 01:01:26.637
the--himself as even capable of
remembering that which he has

01:01:26.637 --> 01:01:33.099
seen and therefore the authority
of the poetic voice.

01:01:33.099 --> 01:01:37.202
This is very extensive and
really goes into all directions,

01:01:37.202 --> 01:01:38.760
has a counter to it.
 

01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:43.920
That's not the only aspect,
the only facet of Dante's text.

01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:47.603
The way I see that is that he's
also capable of taking on a

01:01:47.603 --> 01:01:51.411
prophetic voice,
so that he appears as the one

01:01:51.411 --> 01:01:55.532
who has,
by a singular grace of God,

01:01:55.532 --> 01:02:01.380
been chosen to explore the
world in the beyond,

01:02:01.380 --> 01:02:04.800
which is really caught and
understood in the most physical

01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:05.820
and direct way.
 

01:02:05.820 --> 01:02:09.590
So the two voices are
simultaneously present.

01:02:09.590 --> 01:02:14.018
How does one condition the
other?

01:02:14.018 --> 01:02:18.260
I think that that is really the
tension of this poem.

01:02:18.260 --> 01:02:25.916
Dante is both a prophet and
Dante is the poet who knows the

01:02:25.916 --> 01:02:30.800
arbitrariness of this
construction.

01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:37.018
He's the poet theologian and
the poet--the poetic allegorist.

01:02:37.018 --> 01:02:39.969
The two voices are
simultaneously present.

01:02:39.969 --> 01:02:42.380
What is the point of doing this?
 

01:02:42.380 --> 01:02:49.650
In many ways this makes the
poem the actual experience of a

01:02:49.650 --> 01:02:51.280
pilgrimage.
 

01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:55.969
That is to say,
it's how you connect yourself,

01:02:55.969 --> 01:02:59.210
what kind of judgment do you
give of what--

01:02:59.210 --> 01:03:01.280
of the realities that Dante's
representing,

01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:05.034
that is going to reveal to you
yourself: who you are and where

01:03:05.034 --> 01:03:05.650
you are.
 

01:03:05.650 --> 01:03:08.650
It's a way of shifting the
point of Dante's--

01:03:08.650 --> 01:03:13.010
the voice of the master who can
tell you how things are,

01:03:13.010 --> 01:03:18.208
to the interpretative journey,
to an allegorical journey where

01:03:18.208 --> 01:03:23.320
you're going to decipher and all
the time involve yourself in

01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:24.599
this story.
 

01:03:24.599 --> 01:03:27.659
This can be--can turn out--I
think this is his wish.

01:03:27.659 --> 01:03:31.112
This story, which is his
journey, can turn out to be your

01:03:31.112 --> 01:03:31.730
journey.
 

01:03:31.730 --> 01:03:33.679
You can tell your own story.
 

01:03:33.679 --> 01:03:35.030
Do you see what I'm saying?
 

01:03:35.030 --> 01:03:38.340
That's I think the--that's a
very good question and I hope I

01:03:38.340 --> 01:03:40.360
have been clear in answering
this.

01:03:40.360 --> 01:03:42.039
You may agree or not agree with
it;

01:03:42.039 --> 01:03:44.967
that's another story,
but I hope I've been really

01:03:44.967 --> 01:03:46.309
clear in the answer.
 

01:03:46.309 --> 01:03:47.409
Yes?
 

01:03:47.409 --> 01:03:49.440
Student:  I have one
more question.

01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:50.849
In terms of the narrow issue of
justice,

01:03:50.849 --> 01:03:54.760
do you think that Dante doesn't
have so much a problem with the

01:03:54.760 --> 01:03:58.608
system of an eye for an eye as
with the idea that only someone

01:03:58.608 --> 01:04:01.887
with the intelligence of God
could accurately see the

01:04:01.887 --> 01:04:05.545
correspondences and prescribe
the right punishments for the

01:04:05.545 --> 01:04:06.429
crime.
 

01:04:06.429 --> 01:04:09.447
So it's not that the actual
system is bad,

01:04:09.447 --> 01:04:13.719
it's just that Dante and humans
can't presume to make those

01:04:13.719 --> 01:04:14.750
judgments.
 

01:04:14.750 --> 01:04:17.900
Prof: The other question
that follows,

01:04:17.900 --> 01:04:21.869
the follow up question is:
does it mean that Dante may--

01:04:21.869 --> 01:04:25.659
can one say that Dante actually
doesn't have problems with the

01:04:25.659 --> 01:04:29.146
basic structure,
but only with the human ability

01:04:29.146 --> 01:04:30.860
to grasp how it works?
 

01:04:30.860 --> 01:04:34.429
I would agree with that.
 

01:04:34.429 --> 01:04:37.657
However, I think that what he
really has problems with,

01:04:37.657 --> 01:04:40.106
is the notion,
which was a practice at the

01:04:40.106 --> 01:04:44.059
time, the notion of revenge;
the way of understanding

01:04:44.059 --> 01:04:45.760
justice as revenge.
 

01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:49.518
Now even the Bible will go on
and tell you that the--

01:04:49.518 --> 01:04:53.353
that 'revenge is mine,
so says the Lord,' but Dante

01:04:53.353 --> 01:04:56.889
would say,
that's God's voice and not the

01:04:56.889 --> 01:04:57.989
human voice.
 

01:04:57.989 --> 01:05:00.869
So he clearly has an objection
to that.

01:05:00.869 --> 01:05:03.436
Is there some
implication--because that's

01:05:03.436 --> 01:05:06.965
really what I think you're
asking me, I hope that's what

01:05:06.965 --> 01:05:10.239
you're asking me,
otherwise I'm completely off.

01:05:10.239 --> 01:05:15.710
Is there some implication that
the universe itself,

01:05:15.710 --> 01:05:19.271
its divine economy,
there may be something

01:05:19.271 --> 01:05:22.400
unfathomable and I would say
yes,

01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:25.889
that the whole question of
justice is something we cannot

01:05:25.889 --> 01:05:28.320
quite measure with human
instruments.

01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:31.469
There is one great metaphor
that Dante will give in Canto,

01:05:31.469 --> 01:05:34.873
I believe, XIX of
Paradise where he goes

01:05:34.873 --> 01:05:38.942
back again to the question of
justice and he talks about

01:05:38.942 --> 01:05:42.789
justice in terms of the
salvation of the Hindus.

01:05:42.789 --> 01:05:45.679
Why shouldn't they be here?
 

01:05:45.679 --> 01:05:49.248
I mean what--he wonders about
that and the answer that he

01:05:49.248 --> 01:05:52.880
gives is, he says that the
question of justice is like the

01:05:52.880 --> 01:05:53.389
sea.
 

01:05:53.389 --> 01:05:57.364
When you are really near the
shore you see the bottom and

01:05:57.364 --> 01:06:00.900
everything seems to be--
the waters are clear and

01:06:00.900 --> 01:06:04.985
transparent and you really seem
to touch bottom and see the

01:06:04.985 --> 01:06:05.690
bottom.
 

01:06:05.690 --> 01:06:10.331
As soon as you go in,
then the unfathomable ocean

01:06:10.331 --> 01:06:15.940
takes over and the foundation,
the ground of it all remains

01:06:15.940 --> 01:06:18.940
invisible and inaccessible.
 

01:06:18.940 --> 01:06:22.465
Do you see what the
argument--that's the argument he

01:06:22.465 --> 01:06:23.639
goes on giving?
 

01:06:23.639 --> 01:06:28.878
It's not an issue that he has
resolved here once and for all,

01:06:28.878 --> 01:06:32.110
he will go back to these
questions.

01:06:32.110 --> 01:06:35.344
Student:  I have a
question about the term you were

01:06:35.344 --> 01:06:38.581
using earlier,
when you were talking about the

01:06:38.581 --> 01:06:42.420
ineffability,
I couldn't make out if you were

01:06:42.420 --> 01:06:45.159
saying the ineffability trope?
 

01:06:45.159 --> 01:06:48.431
Prof: Yeah,
I called it--because it's

01:06:48.431 --> 01:06:49.650
really jargon.
 

01:06:49.650 --> 01:06:53.630
The question is:
I'm using ineffability trope.

01:06:53.630 --> 01:06:59.657
It's more a--trope is a
device--I called it topos which

01:06:59.657 --> 01:07:04.074
is a place where some--
they talk about--topos is

01:07:04.074 --> 01:07:06.427
something that keeps,
like a type,

01:07:06.427 --> 01:07:08.789
keeps repeating and can be
used.

01:07:08.789 --> 01:07:12.768
Dante uses this idea of
ineffability.

01:07:12.768 --> 01:07:16.210
What he's really talking about,
the impossible metaphor that

01:07:16.210 --> 01:07:19.474
can hold or represent two
different realities and I think

01:07:19.474 --> 01:07:22.798
that that's exactly the way he
wants to think of crime and

01:07:22.798 --> 01:07:26.590
punishment: the relationship
between crime and punishment,

01:07:26.590 --> 01:07:29.568
which is a metaphorical one,
which is a kind of relationship

01:07:29.568 --> 01:07:32.092
that tries to equal--
an equal relationship between

01:07:32.092 --> 01:07:32.610
two terms.
 

01:07:32.610 --> 01:07:36.360
I called it topos, a Greek word.
 

01:07:36.360 --> 01:07:42.110
We call it commonplace,
it means place.

01:07:50.989 --> 01:07:54.050
Okay, we'll see you next time.

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.045
Well, we've looked at a number
of ways in which the late

00:00:05.045 --> 00:00:08.462
Elizabethan and early
seventeenth-century period was a

00:00:08.462 --> 00:00:12.029
rather anxious age,
and one of the things that the

00:00:12.029 --> 00:00:15.596
authorities in Elizabethan
England and under the early

00:00:15.596 --> 00:00:19.500
Stuarts were very generally
concerned about was the problem

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.900
of order,
which naturally raises the

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.163
question of just how disorderly
society was at the turn of the

00:00:25.163 --> 00:00:27.250
sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries.

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.838
And today I want to approach
that in one way by looking at

00:00:31.838 --> 00:00:36.587
two of the kinds of crime which
provided much of the serious

00:00:36.587 --> 00:00:41.336
criminal activity dealt with by
Elizabethan and early Stuart

00:00:41.336 --> 00:00:46.890
courts and which will help us to
approach this general problem.

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.561
One aspect of crimes of
violence and the other crimes

00:00:50.561 --> 00:00:53.950
against property and how they
were dealt with.

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:57.210
Okay. We'll start with violence.
 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.790
So how violent a society was
Elizabethan and early Stuart

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:02.609
England?
 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.239
It's a question which has quite
seriously divided historians.

00:01:07.239 --> 00:01:11.534
Prior to the 1970s I suppose
there was a general consensus

00:01:11.534 --> 00:01:15.376
that it was indeed an
exceedingly violent society by

00:01:15.376 --> 00:01:16.959
modern standards.
 

00:01:16.959 --> 00:01:20.412
Lawrence Stone,
the great Princeton early

00:01:20.412 --> 00:01:25.504
modernist, provides one of the
most forthright statements on

00:01:25.504 --> 00:01:26.799
this point.
 

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:29.379
He was a historian who was good
at really forthright statements,

00:01:29.379 --> 00:01:33.331
and in his book The Crisis
of the Aristocracy he writes

00:01:33.331 --> 00:01:37.218
that "the behavior of the
propertied classes and that of

00:01:37.218 --> 00:01:40.330
the poor was characterized by
the ferocity,

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.646
childishness,
and lack of self-control of the

00:01:43.646 --> 00:01:46.691
Homeric age"--
imagine Brad Pitt in

00:01:46.691 --> 00:01:49.540
Troy--&lt;
;&gt;

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.828
and unless we can "grasp
these basic psychological

00:01:52.828 --> 00:01:54.717
premises"
we cannot hope to

00:01:54.717 --> 00:01:57.519
understand"
the scale of the problem which

00:01:57.519 --> 00:01:58.920
the Tudors faced.
 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.260
Well, that's Lawrence Stone.
 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.703
He continues,
"their nerves seemed to

00:02:02.703 --> 00:02:06.042
have been perpetually on
edge," breeding language in

00:02:06.042 --> 00:02:09.617
quarrels "so intemperate as
to be almost deranged,"

00:02:09.617 --> 00:02:13.253
and "a readiness to resort
to direct action with no holds

00:02:13.253 --> 00:02:17.068
barred and a general contempt
for legal restraint."

00:02:17.068 --> 00:02:19.949
Well, a couple of decades later
Alan Macfarlane in a book on

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:22.546
crime in the north of England,
The Justice and the

00:02:22.546 --> 00:02:24.042
Mare's Ale,
took an almost

00:02:24.042 --> 00:02:25.680
diametrically opposed view.
 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.580
He quotes contemporary
travelers and diarists of the

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.408
seventeenth century and
concludes,

00:02:32.408 --> 00:02:34.811
"the very strong
impression these works

00:02:34.811 --> 00:02:38.105
give" me is of "a
society in which people were not

00:02:38.105 --> 00:02:40.340
moved by irrational anger and
fury,

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.990
where they did not live or
travel in fear,

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:46.663
where despite physical hardship
there was a great deal of

00:02:46.663 --> 00:02:48.830
tenderness and affection."
 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:53.169
Well, what I want to suggest in
looking at some of the evidence

00:02:53.169 --> 00:02:57.160
today is that both of these
positions have some merit,

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.763
but they're also partial
because both are in different

00:03:01.763 --> 00:03:03.240
ways one sided.
 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.414
And if we're to approach this
problem adequately we really

00:03:06.414 --> 00:03:08.699
need to make a number of
distinctions,

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:11.482
distinctions geographically
between different parts of the

00:03:11.482 --> 00:03:13.918
kingdom,
distinctions socially between

00:03:13.918 --> 00:03:16.210
the behavior of different
groups,

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:19.727
and we need also to look at
these matters chronologically

00:03:19.727 --> 00:03:23.370
with a sense of the changes
which took place over time,

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.068
and I'll try to do these things.
 

00:03:26.068 --> 00:03:30.057
But let's begin by looking at
some of the special cases

00:03:30.057 --> 00:03:34.047
geographically and socially
which will give us a little

00:03:34.047 --> 00:03:35.818
drama to start with.
 

00:03:35.818 --> 00:03:39.637
There's no doubt for example
that in the late sixteenth

00:03:39.637 --> 00:03:43.312
century and into the early
decades of the seventeenth

00:03:43.312 --> 00:03:47.555
century there were some areas of
England and Wales which were

00:03:47.555 --> 00:03:51.301
indeed quite seriously
disorderly and in which violent

00:03:51.301 --> 00:03:54.060
crime was more or less endemic.
 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.276
The most notable area of all
was the Scottish border area

00:03:58.276 --> 00:04:02.645
running between Carlisle and
Berwick and consisting of high

00:04:02.645 --> 00:04:06.110
bare hills dividing England from
Scotland.

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:10.226
This whole area and the
counties to the south of it were

00:04:10.226 --> 00:04:14.266
periodically disturbed by the
threat of what was called

00:04:14.266 --> 00:04:17.415
'reiving',
raiding, conducted by members

00:04:17.415 --> 00:04:21.461
of the so-called 'surnames',
members of certain border clans

00:04:21.461 --> 00:04:24.800
who might be situated on either
side of the border,

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.990
also known as 'moss-troopers'.
 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.829
Men who belonged to families
like the Armstrongs,

00:04:31.829 --> 00:04:33.750
the Grahams,
the Ridleys,

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.550
the Robsons,
the Halls, the Fosters,

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.110
the Elliots,
the Dicksons.

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:41.834
I noticed looking through the
roster we have a Dickson in this

00:04:41.834 --> 00:04:43.310
class, which is quite worrying.
 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:44.980
&gt;
 

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:48.937
These were people who would set
out when the opportunity

00:04:48.937 --> 00:04:52.610
provided itself on their little
Galloway ponies--

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:57.730
generally armed with a leather
jerkin and a steel cap,

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:00.610
dagger at the back,
crossbow on the saddle,

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:04.670
lance and sword--to raid,
and they raided on both the

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:09.199
other side of the border and in
their own kingdoms also.

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:12.970
It was said of the Armstrongs
and the Grahams,

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:15.774
there was a contemporary
proverb, "Armstrongs and

00:05:15.774 --> 00:05:17.519
Grahams ride thieves all."
 

00:05:17.519 --> 00:05:19.269
Well, these were the
moss-troopers,

00:05:19.269 --> 00:05:20.350
the border reivers.
 

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:23.735
I've actually looked at the
indictments for the courts for

00:05:23.735 --> 00:05:27.120
the county of Northumberland
between Newcastle and Berwick

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:31.100
and they reveal a great deal of
the activities of these people.

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:34.511
They're quite distinctive
compared to other criminal

00:05:34.511 --> 00:05:35.180
records.
 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:38.045
Instead of finding someone
accused for example of stealing

00:05:38.045 --> 00:05:39.365
of a hen,
or a piglet,

00:05:39.365 --> 00:05:43.074
or something like that,
kind of commonplace thefts,

00:05:43.074 --> 00:05:47.505
in this area you find people
accused of stealing twenty

00:05:47.505 --> 00:05:51.023
cattle or forty sheep,
of attacking houses,

00:05:51.023 --> 00:05:53.029
of taking people for ransom.
 

00:05:53.029 --> 00:05:56.560
So many of those involved
belonged to these particular

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.661
surnames,
particular families who were

00:05:58.661 --> 00:06:01.437
notorious,
that they were frequently given

00:06:01.437 --> 00:06:05.300
nicknames because so many of
them had the same name,

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:07.350
and these survive also in the
records.

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:10.314
So, for example,
amongst the men who were

00:06:10.314 --> 00:06:14.910
accused in Northumberland in the
1580s and '90s of reiving,

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:18.540
or of slaying,
used with--using swords,

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:21.720
daggers or lances,
we find, for example,

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:24.226
Thomas Armstrong,
known as "Geordy's

00:06:24.226 --> 00:06:24.980
Tom."
 

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:27.512
His father was called George,
so he's "Geordy's

00:06:27.512 --> 00:06:28.110
Tom."
 

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:31.910
We have William Ridley,
known as 'Slack Will.'

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:34.774
We've got William Hall,
known as "Saucy

00:06:34.774 --> 00:06:35.639
Will."
 

00:06:35.639 --> 00:06:39.509
We have John Dobbs,
alias "Crooked Jock";

00:06:39.509 --> 00:06:42.379
John Foster,
alias "Red John",

00:06:42.379 --> 00:06:44.220
and so one could go on.
 

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:45.850
I think you get the general
idea.

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:49.069
My favorite border reiver was
in fact a Scotsman,

00:06:49.069 --> 00:06:52.410
Clement Crosier,
who was known by the wonderful

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:56.040
nickname of "Nebless
Clem," "Nebless

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:57.129
Clem."
 

00:06:57.129 --> 00:06:59.271
A "neb"
in the dialect of the area was

00:06:59.271 --> 00:07:01.769
the tip of your nose;
that's your neb.

00:07:01.769 --> 00:07:05.576
And Nebless Clem had lost the
tip of his nose in a sword

00:07:05.576 --> 00:07:06.129
fight.
 

00:07:06.129 --> 00:07:08.620
A broadsword stroke had taken
off the end of his nose,

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:12.115
so he was known ever after as
"Nebless Clem,"

00:07:12.115 --> 00:07:13.800
&gt;
 

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:15.579
and so one could go on.
 

00:07:15.579 --> 00:07:20.620
So, in 1603 when Elizabeth I
died,

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:24.788
the Graham family on the border
decided that until King James VI

00:07:24.788 --> 00:07:29.024
of Scotland reached the south of
England and was crowned as James

00:07:29.024 --> 00:07:32.730
I of England the laws were
temporarily suspended and they

00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:35.709
set off to take advantage of
that fact.

00:07:35.709 --> 00:07:41.733
In a week they raided south--as
far south as Penrith in Cumbria

00:07:41.733 --> 00:07:45.329
and it became known as 'Busy
Week'.

00:07:45.329 --> 00:07:50.410
They took 5,000 cattle,
they did almost 7,000 pounds'

00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:55.983
worth of damage to property,
they captured fourteen men whom

00:07:55.983 --> 00:08:00.353
they held for ransom,
and in the course of attempts

00:08:00.353 --> 00:08:03.778
to resist them they killed
another six.

00:08:03.778 --> 00:08:06.177
So this is the kind of thing
which could happen,

00:08:06.177 --> 00:08:07.860
though it's an extreme example.
 

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:10.769
Now, none of this of course is
typical, but it existed.

00:08:10.769 --> 00:08:12.586
It was going on,
in the border,

00:08:12.586 --> 00:08:15.980
in the border counties and it
needs to be considered,

00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:19.517
and in fact the Welsh border
though less bad was also an area

00:08:19.517 --> 00:08:22.939
which was known for its relative
lawlessness because of the

00:08:22.939 --> 00:08:26.124
possibility of criminals
slipping between jurisdictions

00:08:26.124 --> 00:08:27.540
across the border.
 

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:29.019
Right.
 

00:08:29.019 --> 00:08:32.043
So if the geographical
periphery of the kingdom had

00:08:32.043 --> 00:08:35.755
some rather special problems,
then so too did the social

00:08:35.755 --> 00:08:38.830
periphery of the aristocracy and
the gentry.

00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:43.267
Lawrence Stone in The Crisis
of the Aristocracy cites far

00:08:43.267 --> 00:08:47.351
too many specific cases of
aristocratic and gentry violence

00:08:47.351 --> 00:08:48.620
to be ignored.
 

00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:52.186
These were people who could be
exceedingly touchy about

00:08:52.186 --> 00:08:55.884
personal honor and willing
sometimes to resort to extreme

00:08:55.884 --> 00:08:59.320
measures to revenge slights
against their honor.

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:03.322
Some of them indeed were
virtually above the law in their

00:09:03.322 --> 00:09:05.538
capacity to get away with it.
 

00:09:05.538 --> 00:09:09.076
So, for example,
it's a fact that in 1589 Sir

00:09:09.076 --> 00:09:14.220
Thomas Langton and eighty of his
men besieged Sir Thomas Houghton

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:18.480
and thirty of his men in Lea
Hall in Lancashire,

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:22.700
up in the northwest,
and when they broke in they

00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:26.918
killed Houghton and several of
his defenders.

00:09:26.918 --> 00:09:30.254
When the government established
a special commission to look

00:09:30.254 --> 00:09:33.421
into this particularly bad
example of feuding amongst the

00:09:33.421 --> 00:09:35.922
gentry,
only three of the jurors who

00:09:35.922 --> 00:09:38.070
were appointed dared to turn up.
 

00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:42.057
The rest were too intimidated
by the local power of those

00:09:42.057 --> 00:09:45.830
responsible, and in fact no
formal presentment of this

00:09:45.830 --> 00:09:48.178
offense was ever made at law.
 

00:09:48.178 --> 00:09:51.558
The privy council had to deal
with it in other ways.

00:09:51.558 --> 00:09:55.220
Or to take another example,
in 1580 the Earl of Oxford,

00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:58.940
the man whom some people think
wrote Shakespeare's plays,

00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:02.504
begat an illegitimate child on
a gentlewoman who was under the

00:10:02.504 --> 00:10:04.610
protection of Sir Thomas
Knyvett,

00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:08.586
and that resulted in a feud
between the two which included

00:10:08.586 --> 00:10:12.493
an assassination attempt on
Knyvett in London and several

00:10:12.493 --> 00:10:16.399
armed affrays between their
retainers and servants in the

00:10:16.399 --> 00:10:20.655
streets of London in which four
men were killed and three were

00:10:20.655 --> 00:10:22.470
seriously wounded.
 

00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:26.344
And yet the courtiers
responsible were too powerful to

00:10:26.344 --> 00:10:29.048
be actually indicted in the
courts.

00:10:29.048 --> 00:10:32.820
Again the privy council
pacified it in other ways.

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:36.328
Well, that kind of aristocratic
and gentry violence could be

00:10:36.328 --> 00:10:38.529
added to from all over the
kingdom.

00:10:38.529 --> 00:10:43.749
It was the result of a code of
behavior which laid a stress on

00:10:43.749 --> 00:10:48.455
competitive assertiveness in
defense of a man's face and

00:10:48.455 --> 00:10:52.990
pride and reputation and one
which could assume,

00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:57.009
in some cases at any rate,
that resort to violence was

00:10:57.009 --> 00:10:59.360
both natural and justifiable.
 

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:02.876
Well, the special problems that
were posed by both the

00:11:02.876 --> 00:11:06.129
geographical and the social
peripheries were fully

00:11:06.129 --> 00:11:09.048
recognized by contemporary
authorities,

00:11:09.048 --> 00:11:12.351
and the Tudor and early Stuart
state did its best to try to

00:11:12.351 --> 00:11:13.320
deal with them.
 

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:16.403
The northern and Welsh borders
were under the special

00:11:16.403 --> 00:11:19.785
jurisdiction of particular
councils established after 1560

00:11:19.785 --> 00:11:22.989
to deal with their special
problems: the Council of the

00:11:22.989 --> 00:11:26.600
North sitting in York,
the Council in the Marches of

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:28.230
Wales sitting in Ludlow.
 

00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:31.720
And they labored to bring
offenders to heel.

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:35.566
Wardens of the Marches were
appointed who also had the duty

00:11:35.566 --> 00:11:39.147
of cooperating with their
opposite numbers on the other

00:11:39.147 --> 00:11:43.058
side of the border in order to
bring offenders to heel.

00:11:43.058 --> 00:11:44.572
Some of them did so
successfully,

00:11:44.572 --> 00:11:45.850
some not so successfully.
 

00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:48.960
In Northumberland,
Sir John Foster,

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:50.879
who was the warden of this part
of the border,

00:11:50.879 --> 00:11:54.275
was notoriously in league with
most of the border reiving

00:11:54.275 --> 00:11:57.023
families himself,
but he was succeeded by others

00:11:57.023 --> 00:11:58.250
who did the job better.
 

00:11:58.250 --> 00:12:00.937
One of them,
Robert Carey,

00:12:00.937 --> 00:12:02.120
loved it.
 

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:05.494
He wrote with enthusiasm to one
of his friends in the south how

00:12:05.494 --> 00:12:08.650
he spent every day in the saddle
pursuing people across the

00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:09.250
border.
 

00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:13.955
When Elizabeth died he was
selected to be the man to carry

00:12:13.955 --> 00:12:18.660
her ring to Scotland to give to
James VI as a token of his

00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:19.899
succession.
 

00:12:19.899 --> 00:12:22.065
They chose him because A,
he was a good rider,

00:12:22.065 --> 00:12:23.220
&gt;
 

00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:27.470
and B, they thought he could
get through the border safely.

00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:31.658
Border commissioners were
appointed by James VI and I,

00:12:31.658 --> 00:12:34.342
when he became King of England,
in order to cooperate even more

00:12:34.342 --> 00:12:36.005
closely,
and indeed the level of

00:12:36.005 --> 00:12:39.101
violence in the border counties
steadily diminishes from that

00:12:39.101 --> 00:12:39.980
point onwards.
 

00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:42.690
By the 1620s,
it was largely over.

00:12:42.690 --> 00:12:46.011
By the 1640s,
in some local histories it was

00:12:46.011 --> 00:12:49.101
being recalled as a rather
romantic past,

00:12:49.101 --> 00:12:53.120
rather than a rather terrifying
present reality.

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:58.724
Again in dealing with feuds and
quarrels amongst the aristocracy

00:12:58.724 --> 00:13:04.149
and gentry the privy council did
its best to try to pacify and

00:13:04.149 --> 00:13:05.928
restrain people.
 

00:13:05.928 --> 00:13:09.192
It heard complaints,
alternative channels through

00:13:09.192 --> 00:13:11.299
which feuds could be settled.
 

00:13:11.299 --> 00:13:12.259
It made inquiries.
 

00:13:12.259 --> 00:13:14.480
It summoned offenders before it
to answer.

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:18.918
It forced arbitration upon
people whose feuds might lead to

00:13:18.918 --> 00:13:19.759
violence.
 

00:13:19.759 --> 00:13:23.808
It put them under bond to keep
the peace.

00:13:23.808 --> 00:13:27.047
The Court of Star Chamber
sitting in Westminster was

00:13:27.047 --> 00:13:30.474
particularly active in dealing
with riotous and violent

00:13:30.474 --> 00:13:32.950
behavior amongst lesser
offenders,

00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:35.750
doling out fines and
imprisonments and so forth,

00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:40.251
and the use of crown patronage
could also help to keep people

00:13:40.251 --> 00:13:43.779
in line if they wanted to retain
royal favor.

00:13:43.779 --> 00:13:48.519
Gradual success in measures of
this kind can be traced.

00:13:48.519 --> 00:13:51.875
That kind of behavior became
less common as the seventeenth

00:13:51.875 --> 00:13:54.769
century advanced and it was
probably accompanied by

00:13:54.769 --> 00:13:57.200
something of a shift in social
values.

00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:01.480
Humanist educators of the
period were beginning to teach

00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:06.230
an alternative notion of honor
and nobility which laid greater

00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:10.278
stress upon civility and
restraint and service to the

00:14:10.278 --> 00:14:13.940
state,
rather than on a prickly form

00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:15.860
of individual honor.
 

00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:19.448
There was the influence of
Protestant preachers too who

00:14:19.448 --> 00:14:22.840
preached a sober and restrained
model of manhood.

00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:27.106
All this was slow to affect
behavior but perhaps significant

00:14:27.106 --> 00:14:31.083
in the long run in changing the
expectations of what was

00:14:31.083 --> 00:14:34.048
tolerable behavior amongst the
elite.

00:14:34.048 --> 00:14:37.467
Indeed, it could be said in
some ways that they were

00:14:37.467 --> 00:14:41.490
providing a model of a sort of a
'new man' for the period.

00:14:41.490 --> 00:14:44.440
There were limits to the
success of all that.

00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:47.200
Competitive assertion was still
commonplace.

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:50.610
Even in such a peaceful
environment as the University of

00:14:50.610 --> 00:14:54.333
Cambridge in the late sixteenth
century outbreaks of violence

00:14:54.333 --> 00:14:57.558
amongst the students were
actually quite common.

00:14:57.558 --> 00:15:00.330
There are many records of
students disciplined for such

00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:02.690
activities as pulling one
another's beards,

00:15:02.690 --> 00:15:04.936
which was a way to insult
someone if you were in a quarrel

00:15:04.936 --> 00:15:06.456
with him,
pull their beard--it was

00:15:06.456 --> 00:15:08.070
thought to be terribly
humiliating--

00:15:08.070 --> 00:15:13.909
or activities such as in 1601,
I think it was,

00:15:13.909 --> 00:15:16.340
when the students of St.
 

00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:21.797
John's College attacked Trinity
College en masse armed

00:15:21.797 --> 00:15:22.980
with clubs.
 

00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:26.303
They were repelled by the
students of Trinity College who

00:15:26.303 --> 00:15:30.044
climbed to the top of the tower
and threw pieces of masonry down

00:15:30.044 --> 00:15:31.528
on the attacking mob.
 

00:15:31.528 --> 00:15:35.610
This had to be quelled by the
university watch and many of the

00:15:35.610 --> 00:15:39.827
students concerned were whipped
in their college halls or put in

00:15:39.827 --> 00:15:44.110
the stocks in their college
halls as a means of discipline,

00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:45.470
and so one could go on.
 

00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:47.721
The records of the University
of Cambridge are extremely

00:15:47.721 --> 00:15:48.950
interesting in this respect.
 

00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:52.981
On one occasion in the 1590s,
a group of students pretended

00:15:52.981 --> 00:15:57.221
to be the city watch and went
around forcing taverns which had

00:15:57.221 --> 00:16:00.558
closed for the night to open and
serve them.

00:16:00.558 --> 00:16:03.277
They trashed the Cross Keys
Tavern and again there was a

00:16:03.277 --> 00:16:05.649
major disciplinary action as a
result of this.

00:16:05.649 --> 00:16:09.167
One of those who trashed the
Cross Keys Tavern was a future

00:16:09.167 --> 00:16:10.320
Bishop of Durham.
 

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:11.700
&gt;
 

00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:14.720
He was there training for the
clergy.

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:17.200
One could go on.
 

00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:19.596
The duel also remained,
of course, a feature of

00:16:19.596 --> 00:16:21.629
aristocratic culture for a long
time.

00:16:21.629 --> 00:16:23.780
There are examples of dueling
right through to the nineteenth

00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:24.139
century.
 

00:16:24.139 --> 00:16:27.360
Most prime ministers of Britain
fought a duel at one time or

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:30.308
another right up to the Duke of
Wellington in the early

00:16:30.308 --> 00:16:33.000
nineteenth century,
but that was a kind of

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.578
individual one-on-one violence,
not as common as is sometimes

00:16:36.578 --> 00:16:39.433
thought,
and very different from open

00:16:39.433 --> 00:16:42.769
feuding with gangs of armed
retainers,

00:16:42.769 --> 00:16:47.000
which had been the kind of
thing which had existed earlier.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:51.120
But to move on,
what about the heart of the

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:54.850
kingdom and less elevated
offenders?

00:16:54.850 --> 00:16:58.375
And that can be approached by
looking at the records for

00:16:58.375 --> 00:16:59.080
homicide.
 

00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:02.405
The records of the Assize
Courts or the King's Bench,

00:17:02.405 --> 00:17:05.284
which met in London,
contain many inquests and

00:17:05.284 --> 00:17:07.140
indictments for homicide.
 

00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:08.690
They're pretty full.
 

00:17:08.690 --> 00:17:11.815
And these provide a fair
opportunity to examine the

00:17:11.815 --> 00:17:14.440
actual incidence of crimes of
this kind.

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:17.834
It was a hard crime to conceal
when someone was killed and

00:17:17.834 --> 00:17:20.990
investigation by coroners was
virtually automatic,

00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:23.838
which could lead to criminal
prosecution.

00:17:23.838 --> 00:17:26.262
J.A. Sharpe in his book,
Crime in Early Modern

00:17:26.262 --> 00:17:28.136
England,
has attempted,

00:17:28.136 --> 00:17:30.980
for part of the mid-seventeenth
century,

00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:35.118
to produce an actual rate of
homicide,

00:17:35.118 --> 00:17:37.490
crimes per hundred thousand
population,

00:17:37.490 --> 00:17:42.291
and he calculates that the
homicide rate in mid-seventeenth

00:17:42.291 --> 00:17:47.509
century England was about three
times that of modern Britain.

00:17:47.509 --> 00:17:50.729
It may indeed have been
somewhat higher since sometimes

00:17:50.729 --> 00:17:54.484
coroners' inquests would fail to
bring a charge in circumstances

00:17:54.484 --> 00:17:57.525
where today it would almost
certainly be listed as a

00:17:57.525 --> 00:17:58.420
homicide.
 

00:17:58.420 --> 00:18:02.808
Others have also attempted
calculations of this kind,

00:18:02.808 --> 00:18:05.140
and what they tend to bring
out, they all agree--

00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:07.480
the figures vary but they all
agree--

00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:11.161
that the levels of indictment
for homicide were actually

00:18:11.161 --> 00:18:15.310
gradually falling from the late
sixteenth century right through

00:18:15.310 --> 00:18:18.190
to the late eighteenth century
in fact.

00:18:18.190 --> 00:18:20.965
And some of the figures that
have been produced are there on

00:18:20.965 --> 00:18:22.660
one of the tables on your
handout.

00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:26.597
If you look at table two,
it's worth looking at in detail

00:18:26.597 --> 00:18:31.308
but if you just look at the last
two columns there you have the--

00:18:31.308 --> 00:18:34.946
a--rate calculated per hundred
thousand population for the

00:18:34.946 --> 00:18:36.990
counties of Surrey and Sussex.
 

00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:40.960
Urban Surrey is London,
south London.

00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:44.041
Then you have rural Surrey,
then a total for the whole

00:18:44.041 --> 00:18:46.950
county, and we also have the
figures for Sussex.

00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:50.779
Surrey is here to the south of
London, Sussex is on the south

00:18:50.779 --> 00:18:51.288
coast.
 

00:18:51.288 --> 00:18:57.711
And what you'll see there is a
steady decline in the rate of

00:18:57.711 --> 00:18:58.910
homicide.
 

00:18:58.910 --> 00:19:03.650
A gradual process of
pacification one could say.

00:19:03.650 --> 00:19:09.026
So this suggests,
perhaps, that it was indeed a

00:19:09.026 --> 00:19:14.868
period with more serious
violence than our own,

00:19:14.868 --> 00:19:19.348
but not one which was inured to
simply casual slaughter.

00:19:19.348 --> 00:19:23.708
We seem to be somewhere in
between Lawrence Stone's violent

00:19:23.708 --> 00:19:27.839
and unrestrained emotional
infants and Alan Macfarlane's

00:19:27.839 --> 00:19:30.019
nice, orderly Englishmen.
 

00:19:30.019 --> 00:19:35.577
The circumstances of the cases
that were heard bring that out

00:19:35.577 --> 00:19:36.690
even more.
 

00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:39.863
In the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries,

00:19:39.863 --> 00:19:44.170
people killed their families
less and their neighbors more

00:19:44.170 --> 00:19:46.210
than is the case today.
 

00:19:46.210 --> 00:19:48.854
In seventeenth-century Essex,
and indeed in late

00:19:48.854 --> 00:19:52.059
sixteenth-century Essex too,
violent slaying was much less

00:19:52.059 --> 00:19:53.578
confined to the family.
 

00:19:53.578 --> 00:19:58.486
In modern Britain about 50% of
homicides take place within the

00:19:58.486 --> 00:19:59.210
family.
 

00:19:59.210 --> 00:20:03.289
In Essex in the early modern
period, it was only 21%,

00:20:03.289 --> 00:20:06.900
even if you include the killing
of servants.

00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:10.880
So violence is more broadly
spread in society.

00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:13.670
But the killing was rarely
premeditated.

00:20:13.670 --> 00:20:18.123
It usually arose from quite
spontaneous resort to violence

00:20:18.123 --> 00:20:20.390
in the course of a quarrel.
 

00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:24.633
In many ways the homicide cases
that survive in the records were

00:20:24.633 --> 00:20:27.259
actually cases of aggravated
assault.

00:20:27.259 --> 00:20:31.048
J.A. Sharpe has analyzed the
weapons that were used.

00:20:31.048 --> 00:20:34.208
He finds that poisoning,
a very calculated act of

00:20:34.208 --> 00:20:35.920
homicide, was very rare.
 

00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:39.855
Guns and swords and knives were
rarely used, which is perhaps

00:20:39.855 --> 00:20:43.989
surprising since nearly everyone
carried a knife to cut up their

00:20:43.989 --> 00:20:44.578
food.
 

00:20:44.578 --> 00:20:47.750
Even housewives generally
carried two knives.

00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:49.430
It was a badge of their
position in the family.

00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:52.443
They had double sheaths with
two knives to use about their

00:20:52.443 --> 00:20:52.920
duties.
 

00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:56.888
The commonest weapons used for
homicide in this period were

00:20:56.888 --> 00:21:01.269
simply tools which people had
picked up in a moment of anger,

00:21:01.269 --> 00:21:05.230
or sticks, or cudgels,
or fists and feet.

00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:08.383
In more than two thirds of the
cases examined by Sharpe,

00:21:08.383 --> 00:21:11.480
people killed others with their
fists or their feet.

00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:15.980
These were brawls then which
resulted in a death.

00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:20.938
So homicide emerges as largely
a question of violence arising

00:21:20.938 --> 00:21:25.650
amongst neighbors in the course
of day-to-day quarrels.

00:21:25.650 --> 00:21:29.248
It does indeed suggest that
there was a degree of

00:21:29.248 --> 00:21:33.670
willingness to strike out with
relatively small provocation,

00:21:33.670 --> 00:21:35.470
which is unfamiliar.
 

00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:36.740
At least among men.
 

00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:38.318
Women are very rarely involved.
 

00:21:38.318 --> 00:21:44.053
They turn up in homicide cases
usually only in the very special

00:21:44.053 --> 00:21:49.880
circumstances of accusations of
witchcraft or of infanticide.

00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:53.307
So before coming to the
conclusion that this was a

00:21:53.307 --> 00:21:57.224
significantly more violent
society than our own we should

00:21:57.224 --> 00:22:01.281
also take into account the fact
that in the seventeenth and

00:22:01.281 --> 00:22:05.900
twentieth centuries the figures
are not strictly comparable.

00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:09.421
Many of those who died as a
result of such casual violence

00:22:09.421 --> 00:22:13.250
in the seventeenth century would
actually have been saved today

00:22:13.250 --> 00:22:15.288
by modern medical techniques.
 

00:22:15.288 --> 00:22:19.003
The crimes concerned would be
down as serious assault rather

00:22:19.003 --> 00:22:22.088
than as homicide and one has to
allow for that.

00:22:22.088 --> 00:22:26.269
But nevertheless something was
going on in the period,

00:22:26.269 --> 00:22:30.660
a gradual decline in the rates
of homicide even though modern

00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:35.269
medical techniques had not come
in during the period of the--

00:22:35.269 --> 00:22:38.319
covered by the tables that you
have there.

00:22:38.319 --> 00:22:41.940
So something is going on.
 

00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:44.564
Overall then,
one can say some areas of the

00:22:44.564 --> 00:22:47.875
kingdom which had provided
special problems were being

00:22:47.875 --> 00:22:49.929
pacified,
some social groups who

00:22:49.929 --> 00:22:52.608
presented a special problem were
being pacified,

00:22:52.608 --> 00:22:56.653
and it seems likely that the
higher degree of spontaneous

00:22:56.653 --> 00:23:00.839
violence amongst otherwise
respectable people was gradually

00:23:00.839 --> 00:23:02.140
being reduced.
 

00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:04.910
There were limits to the
violence of the period,

00:23:04.910 --> 00:23:07.108
limits to what was regarded as
tolerable,

00:23:07.108 --> 00:23:09.480
serious efforts to try to
contain it,

00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:17.150
and the figures suggest that
they were meeting some success.

00:23:17.150 --> 00:23:20.318
Well, let's turn now to crimes
against property.

00:23:20.318 --> 00:23:24.695
If violence might seem to us
the principal indicator of the

00:23:24.695 --> 00:23:29.277
orderliness of a society,
contemporaries were actually

00:23:29.277 --> 00:23:34.298
much more concerned with the
problem of trends in theft.

00:23:34.298 --> 00:23:37.808
Many of them believed that they
were witnessing in the--

00:23:37.808 --> 00:23:41.332
at the turn of the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries

00:23:41.332 --> 00:23:44.588
something of a wave of crimes
against property.

00:23:44.588 --> 00:23:48.236
And when you look at the court
records it's always property

00:23:48.236 --> 00:23:51.818
crimes which predominate in the
evidence that survives.

00:23:51.818 --> 00:23:54.068
If you look at your handout,
table one,

00:23:54.068 --> 00:23:59.891
that breaks down the crimes
dealt with by various court

00:23:59.891 --> 00:24:06.357
jurisdictions in the counties
I've marked on the map here and

00:24:06.357 --> 00:24:13.150
overwhelmingly property offenses
dominate those statistics.

00:24:13.150 --> 00:24:15.269
Property crimes of all sorts,
in fact,

00:24:15.269 --> 00:24:19.643
seem to have been rising in
most of the areas of England for

00:24:19.643 --> 00:24:23.721
which we have evidence from
roughly the 1580s through to

00:24:23.721 --> 00:24:27.650
roughly the 1620s and then
gradually diminishing.

00:24:27.650 --> 00:24:31.814
And there's an example of that
in table three on your handout

00:24:31.814 --> 00:24:35.838
where we have the figures for
Chester in the northwest,

00:24:35.838 --> 00:24:39.815
which has very good records,
and you get that upward trend

00:24:39.815 --> 00:24:43.929
followed by a significantly
lower level of property offenses

00:24:43.929 --> 00:24:46.509
later in the seventeenth
century.

00:24:46.509 --> 00:24:51.750
Well, certain trends can be
discerned then;

00:24:51.750 --> 00:24:54.919
a real problem at the turn of
the century getting somewhat

00:24:54.919 --> 00:24:55.920
better later on.
 

00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:59.141
But when we talk about property
crime of course it's a rather

00:24:59.141 --> 00:25:02.470
blanket term and it covers a
multitude of specific offenses.

00:25:02.470 --> 00:25:06.564
There are two principal
distinctions in property crime

00:25:06.564 --> 00:25:08.960
that we need to take note of.
 

00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:13.160
First of all,
they made a distinction between

00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:16.980
capital and noncapital forms of
theft.

00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:21.054
Capital forms of theft were
those which were punished by

00:25:21.054 --> 00:25:24.240
death and they included highway
robbery,

00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:29.282
burglary, and housebreaking and
also thefts of goods worth more

00:25:29.282 --> 00:25:33.055
than one shilling;
that's about a day's wage for a

00:25:33.055 --> 00:25:34.991
London laborer,
twelve pence,

00:25:34.991 --> 00:25:36.098
one shilling.
 

00:25:36.098 --> 00:25:39.468
If you stole goods worth more
than twelve pence or one

00:25:39.468 --> 00:25:43.280
shilling, you were guilty of
'grand larceny' and that carried

00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:44.680
the death penalty.
 

00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:47.969
Then there were noncapital
thefts, 'petty larceny',

00:25:47.969 --> 00:25:51.720
goods of lesser value valued at
less than one shilling;

00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:53.670
that was punishable by whipping.
 

00:25:53.670 --> 00:25:56.170
So they distinguished capital
and noncapital.

00:25:56.170 --> 00:26:00.165
Secondly, they distinguished
forms of property offense which

00:26:00.165 --> 00:26:03.960
were 'clergyable' and those
which were non clergyable.

00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:05.519
What did that mean?
 

00:26:05.519 --> 00:26:10.353
A clergyable offense was one
which was subject to 'benefit of

00:26:10.353 --> 00:26:12.690
clergy', benefit of clergy.
 

00:26:12.690 --> 00:26:16.759
That meant that a person found
guilty,

00:26:16.759 --> 00:26:20.982
even of a capital crime,
could escape hanging by

00:26:20.982 --> 00:26:25.560
claiming benefit of clergy,
by claiming to be a member of

00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:26.338
the clergy.
 

00:26:26.338 --> 00:26:29.487
It was a hangover from the
medieval laws which had exempted

00:26:29.487 --> 00:26:32.578
the clergy from the jurisdiction
of the state's courts.

00:26:32.578 --> 00:26:35.643
By this period it was a
complete fiction but they

00:26:35.643 --> 00:26:39.088
continued to use it in the
procedures of the courts.

00:26:39.088 --> 00:26:43.164
You proved that you deserved
benefit of clergy by proving

00:26:43.164 --> 00:26:46.491
that you could read,
and you proved that you could

00:26:46.491 --> 00:26:49.853
read by reading what was known
as the "neck verse"

00:26:49.853 --> 00:26:52.529
because it saved your neck,
the neck verse.

00:26:52.529 --> 00:26:54.078
Psalm 51, verse 1.
 

00:26:54.078 --> 00:26:56.500
It's very appropriate:
"Have mercy upon me,

00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:59.308
O Lord, according to thy loving
kindness,

00:26:59.308 --> 00:27:02.180
according to the multitude of
thy tender mercies,

00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:04.910
blot out my transgression."
 

00:27:04.910 --> 00:27:07.249
If you could read that
successfully,

00:27:07.249 --> 00:27:08.720
you would be spared.
 

00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:12.138
Grand larceny was clergyable
though some offenses were

00:27:12.138 --> 00:27:15.429
considered so serious that
clergy was not permitted:

00:27:15.429 --> 00:27:18.859
house breaking,
burglary, highway robbery and

00:27:18.859 --> 00:27:20.410
some other offenses.
 

00:27:20.410 --> 00:27:23.208
Clergy applied only to men
because only men could be

00:27:23.208 --> 00:27:26.381
members of the clergy,
but a woman found guilty of a

00:27:26.381 --> 00:27:29.921
capital offense was allowed to
"plead her belly"

00:27:29.921 --> 00:27:32.538
as they put it;
that's to say she could claim

00:27:32.538 --> 00:27:34.710
that she believed herself to be
pregnant.

00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:38.477
If so, she would be spared
since it was clearly unjust to

00:27:38.477 --> 00:27:42.589
hang a pregnant woman,
and if so spared she might

00:27:42.589 --> 00:27:47.640
ultimately be reprieved after
the birth of the child.

00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:49.890
So much for definitions then.
 

00:27:49.890 --> 00:27:52.950
The problem in discussing
property crime is that,

00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:56.064
though one can understand the
system of how they dealt with it

00:27:56.064 --> 00:27:58.730
well enough,
it's impossible to establish

00:27:58.730 --> 00:28:01.380
the actual incidence of these
crimes,

00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:03.943
because what we have in the
court records are not the

00:28:03.943 --> 00:28:07.982
records of all crimes committed,
but simply the records of those

00:28:07.982 --> 00:28:09.548
that got prosecuted.
 

00:28:09.548 --> 00:28:12.749
And that leaves us with what
people refer to as the

00:28:12.749 --> 00:28:16.140
"dark number"
of offenses that we just don't

00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:17.098
know about.
 

00:28:17.098 --> 00:28:20.483
In 1596 for example,
one justice of the peace for

00:28:20.483 --> 00:28:24.290
Somerset said that in his
opinion only about a fifth of

00:28:24.290 --> 00:28:28.663
the property offenses which were
committed ever came before the

00:28:28.663 --> 00:28:31.516
courts;
the rest went unprosecuted,

00:28:31.516 --> 00:28:35.748
largely because people didn't
consider it worth the time and

00:28:35.748 --> 00:28:40.124
trouble and charge of bringing a
case over goods which were of

00:28:40.124 --> 00:28:41.200
low value.
 

00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:44.808
Nevertheless,
as the figures show,

00:28:44.808 --> 00:28:48.515
there was a considerable rise
in the numbers of people who

00:28:48.515 --> 00:28:52.348
were prosecuted at the turn of
the sixteenth and seventeenth

00:28:52.348 --> 00:28:53.259
centuries.
 

00:28:53.259 --> 00:28:56.845
That might possibly be
accounted for partly by

00:28:56.845 --> 00:29:00.303
population rise,
but also there appears to have

00:29:00.303 --> 00:29:04.191
been a real increase over and
above what can be accounted for

00:29:04.191 --> 00:29:06.328
by simply a rising population.
 

00:29:06.328 --> 00:29:09.338
So then are we dealing with a
real increase in property crime,

00:29:09.338 --> 00:29:11.749
a crime wave,
under Elizabeth and the early

00:29:11.749 --> 00:29:13.865
Stuarts,
or, on the other hand,

00:29:13.865 --> 00:29:16.568
is it just a tightening up of
the law,

00:29:16.568 --> 00:29:20.230
not an increase in crime but an
increase in prosecution?

00:29:20.230 --> 00:29:26.150
Well, I'd suggest that it was a
bit of both.

00:29:26.150 --> 00:29:29.873
In considering the problem,
it's helpful to ask the simple

00:29:29.873 --> 00:29:33.665
questions: who were the thieves,
what were the circumstances of

00:29:33.665 --> 00:29:36.400
their offenses,
and so forth?.

00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:40.324
There's very little evidence in
the court records of the

00:29:40.324 --> 00:29:44.319
existence of a professional
criminal class in England.

00:29:44.319 --> 00:29:46.970
It certainly existed in London.
 

00:29:46.970 --> 00:29:50.818
London is another special case
and London certainly had a corps

00:29:50.818 --> 00:29:54.844
of professional criminals,
but elsewhere it's rare to find

00:29:54.844 --> 00:29:58.788
people repeatedly prosecuted in
the courts from whom--

00:29:58.788 --> 00:30:02.068
for whom one can reconstruct a
criminal career.

00:30:02.068 --> 00:30:05.501
They exist and their careers
were not necessarily cut off by

00:30:05.501 --> 00:30:07.828
being hanged for their first
offense,

00:30:07.828 --> 00:30:10.950
as we'll see,
but there seem to have been few

00:30:10.950 --> 00:30:11.660
of them.
 

00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:14.478
The nearest thing you get to a
criminal class in the

00:30:14.478 --> 00:30:17.739
countryside were vagrants who
might steal as part of the way

00:30:17.739 --> 00:30:20.944
in which they managed to get by
and occasionally delinquent

00:30:20.944 --> 00:30:23.454
families,
in particular villagers who

00:30:23.454 --> 00:30:26.586
seem to have been held
responsible for a lot of petty

00:30:26.586 --> 00:30:27.308
offenses.
 

00:30:27.308 --> 00:30:31.670
In one village I worked on in
Lancashire for example,

00:30:31.670 --> 00:30:35.284
there was a man who was known
locally by the nickname

00:30:35.284 --> 00:30:39.244
'Desperate Tom' because of the
frequency with which he was

00:30:39.244 --> 00:30:42.788
involved in petty crime of one
kind or another.

00:30:42.788 --> 00:30:45.619
There were such people,
but not a professional criminal

00:30:45.619 --> 00:30:47.980
class in the sense that we might
expect it.

00:30:47.980 --> 00:30:52.212
Most offenders turn out to have
been drawn from the lowest ranks

00:30:52.212 --> 00:30:55.506
of the rural population:
laborers, poor craftsmen,

00:30:55.506 --> 00:30:56.380
servants.
 

00:30:56.380 --> 00:30:59.250
These are the people who are
disproportionately represented.

00:30:59.250 --> 00:31:03.393
You very rarely find yeoman
farmers, or husbandmen,

00:31:03.393 --> 00:31:07.039
or craftsmen of substance being
presented.

00:31:07.039 --> 00:31:08.798
They're overwhelmingly men.
 

00:31:08.798 --> 00:31:11.190
You very rarely find women
being prosecuted.

00:31:11.190 --> 00:31:15.566
Only about 15% of those accused
of property crimes in the county

00:31:15.566 --> 00:31:18.978
of Hertfordshire for example,
to the north of London,

00:31:18.978 --> 00:31:22.020
were women,
and other counties have similar

00:31:22.020 --> 00:31:22.710
figures.
 

00:31:22.710 --> 00:31:27.579
Most of the offenses they
committed also turn out to have

00:31:27.579 --> 00:31:30.450
been rather opportunistic acts.
 

00:31:30.450 --> 00:31:34.420
What you get is someone
stealing perhaps a small animal

00:31:34.420 --> 00:31:38.684
which had strayed or taking
small goods which they happened

00:31:38.684 --> 00:31:41.480
to have the opportunity to
pilfer.

00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:44.656
And most students of the
problem suggest that for many of

00:31:44.656 --> 00:31:48.175
the rural poor occasional petty
pilfering of that kind may have

00:31:48.175 --> 00:31:50.900
been part and parcel of the way
they got by.

00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:55.480
That's certainly brought out
vividly in years of bad harvest

00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:57.190
or trade depression.
 

00:31:57.190 --> 00:32:00.130
In the town of Manchester for
example,

00:32:00.130 --> 00:32:04.868
in the fairly normal years 1615
to 1621,

00:32:04.868 --> 00:32:08.263
there were about thirteen
people tried for property

00:32:08.263 --> 00:32:09.690
offenses each year.
 

00:32:09.690 --> 00:32:14.140
In the bad harvest year of 1622
to 1623,

00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:16.650
the figure shot up to
thirty-eight,

00:32:16.650 --> 00:32:21.476
and that kind of fluctuation in
particular crisis years is

00:32:21.476 --> 00:32:26.303
something that has been found in
every county that's being

00:32:26.303 --> 00:32:27.318
studied.
 

00:32:27.318 --> 00:32:31.528
Sometimes you have the detailed
circumstances of cases in the

00:32:31.528 --> 00:32:35.667
examinations or the confessions
of those who were brought to

00:32:35.667 --> 00:32:37.942
trial,
and that provides supporting

00:32:37.942 --> 00:32:38.480
evidence.
 

00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:41.230
For example,
in 1626 in the county of

00:32:41.230 --> 00:32:45.740
Worcestershire a man called
William Bride was prosecuted for

00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:49.847
stealing a sheep and he said--
he confessed and said in his

00:32:49.847 --> 00:32:52.920
own defense "that the same
sheep was rotten"--

00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:56.351
that's to say it was sick--and
that he took it "for want

00:32:56.351 --> 00:32:58.410
of food to relieve his
wife."

00:32:58.410 --> 00:33:01.893
Or again in 1623 Robert
Whitehead, a laborer from the

00:33:01.893 --> 00:33:06.519
village of Terling in Essex,
stole and with his family ate a

00:33:06.519 --> 00:33:11.453
sheep and he confessed and said
that he did it "having a

00:33:11.453 --> 00:33:16.058
wife and seven small children
and being hungry."

00:33:16.058 --> 00:33:19.183
They actually identified him as
the thief because they found the

00:33:19.183 --> 00:33:20.920
skin of the sheep in his
cottage;

00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:23.190
it had been eaten.
 

00:33:23.190 --> 00:33:26.085
These things considered,
it may very well appear that

00:33:26.085 --> 00:33:29.093
the general rise in the
incidents of theft in the court

00:33:29.093 --> 00:33:31.932
records at the turn of the
sixteenth and seventeenth

00:33:31.932 --> 00:33:35.082
centuries,
especially these petty thefts,

00:33:35.082 --> 00:33:39.192
may relate to the general
process of pauperization of the

00:33:39.192 --> 00:33:43.597
rural poor which we've already
observed being at its worst in

00:33:43.597 --> 00:33:46.628
this period,
and there's an excellent study

00:33:46.628 --> 00:33:49.875
of this which you find on the
reading list by Peter Lawson

00:33:49.875 --> 00:33:53.009
called "Property Crime and
Hard Times."

00:33:53.009 --> 00:33:55.173
However,
of course, that's only part of

00:33:55.173 --> 00:33:56.098
the explanation.
 

00:33:56.098 --> 00:34:00.019
One can't simply equate poverty
and theft.

00:34:00.019 --> 00:34:05.386
Clearly, most of the poor
didn't steal and of those who

00:34:05.386 --> 00:34:08.369
did not all were prosecuted.
 

00:34:08.369 --> 00:34:10.902
And various other
considerations are at work in

00:34:10.902 --> 00:34:14.150
the kinds of figures that we
have from the court records.

00:34:14.150 --> 00:34:19.949
Often cases weren't brought
because victims of crime simply

00:34:19.949 --> 00:34:26.150
couldn't be bothered with the
expense and trouble involved,

00:34:26.150 --> 00:34:29.945
having to bring a case
themselves, especially if the

00:34:29.945 --> 00:34:33.980
goods had been recovered,
which they sometimes were.

00:34:33.980 --> 00:34:36.480
When goods were found missing
there was often a search by the

00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:36.980
constable.
 

00:34:36.980 --> 00:34:40.588
If they were recovered,
the victim quite frequently

00:34:40.588 --> 00:34:42.320
declined to prosecute.
 

00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:45.860
That was sometimes partly out
of pity for the thief,

00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:49.302
not least because the person
responsible might very often be

00:34:49.302 --> 00:34:52.360
a neighbor,
someone well known to them.

00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:55.518
There was definitely a
preference for mediation in

00:34:55.518 --> 00:34:58.869
settling disputes of all kinds
at the local level.

00:34:58.869 --> 00:35:00.659
The early seventeenth-century
clergyman,

00:35:00.659 --> 00:35:04.030
George Herbert,
clergyman and poet,

00:35:04.030 --> 00:35:08.132
wrote and advised that in such
cases "gentle and

00:35:08.132 --> 00:35:12.710
neighborly admonition"
was the best course to take.

00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:17.344
One should prosecute in the
courts only if a delinquent

00:35:17.344 --> 00:35:20.349
persisted in delinquent
activity.

00:35:20.349 --> 00:35:24.467
So what's at issue in
understanding how these cases

00:35:24.467 --> 00:35:29.327
came up to be recorded in the
court records is of course the

00:35:29.327 --> 00:35:33.610
whole tenor of social
relationships within particular

00:35:33.610 --> 00:35:37.130
neighborhoods,
and it's not surprising that

00:35:37.130 --> 00:35:41.097
people have found when they look
very closely at cases heard in

00:35:41.097 --> 00:35:45.063
the courts that those who were
prosecuted as thieves very often

00:35:45.063 --> 00:35:47.429
have particular characteristics.
 

00:35:47.429 --> 00:35:51.177
They were often outsiders,
not members of the village

00:35:51.177 --> 00:35:55.431
community, not sheltered by
being known, perhaps even liked,

00:35:55.431 --> 00:35:57.090
within the village.
 

00:35:57.090 --> 00:35:59.715
They were often,
if they weren't outsiders,

00:35:59.715 --> 00:36:02.715
very marginal people,
the kind of people who were

00:36:02.715 --> 00:36:05.090
accused of witchcraft for
example.

00:36:05.090 --> 00:36:09.264
They were sometimes known
delinquents who had finally

00:36:09.264 --> 00:36:14.163
exhausted the patience of the
local community by persisting in

00:36:14.163 --> 00:36:15.849
their activities.
 

00:36:15.849 --> 00:36:19.617
But even when they were
actually brought before the

00:36:19.617 --> 00:36:24.141
courts there were various ways
in which the full rigor of the

00:36:24.141 --> 00:36:25.949
law could be spared.
 

00:36:25.949 --> 00:36:30.083
Sometimes having brought a
prosecution in order to scare

00:36:30.083 --> 00:36:34.820
someone, the victim would allow
it to lapse by not turning up to

00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:36.699
see the case through.
 

00:36:36.699 --> 00:36:40.360
The grand juries which had to
look at the cases in the courts

00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:43.838
vetted the indictments which
were brought before them very

00:36:43.838 --> 00:36:47.501
carefully and they could be very
conscientious in weeding out

00:36:47.501 --> 00:36:51.590
cases in which they considered
the evidence to be deficient,

00:36:51.590 --> 00:36:54.476
or they suspected that there
might be an element of malice in

00:36:54.476 --> 00:36:57.057
the prosecution,
or where they simply decided

00:36:57.057 --> 00:37:00.514
that in the circumstances of the
case they were going to be

00:37:00.514 --> 00:37:01.230
merciful.
 

00:37:01.230 --> 00:37:03.070
They vetted each case.
 

00:37:03.070 --> 00:37:05.858
If they wanted it to go to
trial they endorsed the

00:37:05.858 --> 00:37:08.193
indictment billa vera,
a true bill,

00:37:08.193 --> 00:37:09.559
and it went forward.
 

00:37:09.559 --> 00:37:12.193
If they thought it could be--it
should lapse,

00:37:12.193 --> 00:37:14.710
they endorsed the bill
ignoramus;

00:37:14.710 --> 00:37:17.976
they wrote the word
ignoramus on the bill,

00:37:17.976 --> 00:37:21.719
literally "we do not
know," and the case would

00:37:21.719 --> 00:37:22.739
be dropped.
 

00:37:22.739 --> 00:37:26.663
In the county of Sussex in the
early seventeenth century,

00:37:26.663 --> 00:37:30.027
as many as a quarter of
indictments were actually

00:37:30.027 --> 00:37:32.969
dropped in this way by the grand
jury.

00:37:32.969 --> 00:37:39.016
Or again, if the case came to
trial, trial juries of neighbors

00:37:39.016 --> 00:37:42.090
frequently failed to convict.
 

00:37:42.090 --> 00:37:46.128
Some of them were moved
probably by a degree of

00:37:46.128 --> 00:37:49.639
compassion for the person before
them.

00:37:49.639 --> 00:37:53.141
They frequently indulged in the
practice of reducing the

00:37:53.141 --> 00:37:56.199
valuation of the goods which had
been stolen,

00:37:56.199 --> 00:37:58.940
so that a person would get a
lesser conviction.

00:37:58.940 --> 00:38:03.213
So for example they might have
someone before them for stealing

00:38:03.213 --> 00:38:07.349
a sheep valued at two shillings,
which would have carried the

00:38:07.349 --> 00:38:10.088
death penalty;
they decide that the person

00:38:10.088 --> 00:38:12.309
needs punishing but not that
severely,

00:38:12.309 --> 00:38:15.498
and so they would find them
guilty but reduce the value of

00:38:15.498 --> 00:38:17.849
the sheep to ten pence or eleven
pence,

00:38:17.849 --> 00:38:21.141
which would mean petty larceny
and the person concerned would

00:38:21.141 --> 00:38:24.130
be whipped,
rather than hanged.

00:38:24.130 --> 00:38:26.809
All of that was extremely
common.

00:38:26.809 --> 00:38:30.280
For example,
in Elizabethan Essex a fifth of

00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:34.641
all property offenses had the
valuation reduced in that

00:38:34.641 --> 00:38:35.530
manner.
 

00:38:35.530 --> 00:38:38.570
And finally there was the use
of benefit of clergy.

00:38:38.570 --> 00:38:41.469
This was very important indeed.
 

00:38:41.469 --> 00:38:45.800
In Elizabethan Essex,
only a tiny proportion of those

00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:50.630
who were convicted of stealing
sheep, which was clergyable,

00:38:50.630 --> 00:38:53.630
were actually sentenced to
hang;

00:38:53.630 --> 00:38:56.980
could be as low as six percent
in particular years.

00:38:56.980 --> 00:39:00.610
The rest were permitted clergy
and,

00:39:00.610 --> 00:39:04.980
since the levels of literacy
were so low in this period that

00:39:04.980 --> 00:39:09.498
it seems highly unlikely that
such a high proportion of felons

00:39:09.498 --> 00:39:13.215
could actually read,
it's perfectly clear that the

00:39:13.215 --> 00:39:17.271
magistrates and the judges were
permitting any kind of stumbling

00:39:17.271 --> 00:39:21.210
through the neck verse,
often from memory probably,

00:39:21.210 --> 00:39:26.262
in order to allow them to have
this means of escaping the death

00:39:26.262 --> 00:39:27.159
penalty.
 

00:39:27.159 --> 00:39:29.079
Of the--to give you the precise
figures--

00:39:29.079 --> 00:39:34.911
of 790 people who were allowed
to attempt to read in the courts

00:39:34.911 --> 00:39:43.630
of Elizabethan Essex,
only nine failed to do so.

00:39:43.630 --> 00:39:46.322
And finally,
convicted and condemned felons

00:39:46.322 --> 00:39:50.297
were not infrequently reprieved
if the judge thought that there

00:39:50.297 --> 00:39:51.900
was a case for mercy.
 

00:39:51.900 --> 00:39:55.367
The judge ended every assize
court by recommending those who

00:39:55.367 --> 00:39:58.364
would be reprieved,
especially if there were

00:39:58.364 --> 00:40:02.271
respectable members of the
community who were willing to

00:40:02.271 --> 00:40:03.550
speak for them.
 

00:40:03.550 --> 00:40:07.547
All of this goes to show quite
clearly that the apparent

00:40:07.547 --> 00:40:11.911
savagery of the law did not in
practice vent itself on people

00:40:11.911 --> 00:40:15.110
quite as severely as one might
suspect,

00:40:15.110 --> 00:40:17.980
or certainly not in an
unrestrained manner.

00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:21.179
It was used with a great deal
of discretion,

00:40:21.179 --> 00:40:24.449
and discretion in the way the
law was used is something of a

00:40:24.449 --> 00:40:27.829
key word for historians of
criminal justice in this period.

00:40:27.829 --> 00:40:31.331
That issue, discretion,
and how it was used is

00:40:31.331 --> 00:40:36.077
absolutely central to the two
classic articles which you'll be

00:40:36.077 --> 00:40:38.880
reading for next week's section.
 

00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:41.840
In one of them,
Douglas Hay has argued that

00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:45.929
this use of discretion was a
quite calculated policy by the

00:40:45.929 --> 00:40:49.597
magistrates to balance the
terror of the law with the

00:40:49.597 --> 00:40:54.090
practice of mercy,
and by doing so to retain the

00:40:54.090 --> 00:40:57.949
gratitude and the deference of
the poor.

00:40:57.949 --> 00:41:00.730
Make examples of a few;
pardon the rest.

00:41:00.730 --> 00:41:02.699
It's conducive to order.
 

00:41:02.699 --> 00:41:03.800
That's his argument.
 

00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:06.679
Cynthia Herrup takes a rather
different line.

00:41:06.679 --> 00:41:10.246
She argues that the operation
of the law involved many

00:41:10.246 --> 00:41:13.949
elements of participation by
rulers and ruled alike,

00:41:13.949 --> 00:41:16.561
not only the judges and the
magistrates but the members of

00:41:16.561 --> 00:41:17.570
juries and so forth.
 

00:41:17.570 --> 00:41:21.916
As many as three dozen people
could be involved in a case from

00:41:21.916 --> 00:41:25.980
its earliest investigation
through to the actual trial.

00:41:25.980 --> 00:41:29.735
And she suggests that among
such people there were certain

00:41:29.735 --> 00:41:34.068
shared ideals of justice,
which meant that they tended to

00:41:34.068 --> 00:41:39.206
practice the gradual sifting out
at various stages of the case of

00:41:39.206 --> 00:41:43.059
those whom they deemed to be
truly culpable,

00:41:43.059 --> 00:41:45.639
truly criminal.
 

00:41:45.639 --> 00:41:48.684
Those hanged were those who
stole for profit,

00:41:48.684 --> 00:41:52.076
who stole in a planned manner,
who were strangers,

00:41:52.076 --> 00:41:55.260
who failed to confess and
express remorse.

00:41:55.260 --> 00:41:58.974
And she argues that this
expressed what was fundamentally

00:41:58.974 --> 00:42:03.331
a religious attitude;
that all people are potentially

00:42:03.331 --> 00:42:08.722
sinful, that only some are so
hardened in evil that they are

00:42:08.722 --> 00:42:11.280
incapable of reformation.
 

00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:15.393
Well, these are cases you can
read for yourself and debate

00:42:15.393 --> 00:42:16.260
next week.
 

00:42:16.260 --> 00:42:19.760
So then discretion was widely
used,

00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:25.543
but nevertheless it should also
be emphasized that none of this

00:42:25.543 --> 00:42:31.050
leniency and clemency and
discretion could be guaranteed.

00:42:31.050 --> 00:42:36.079
The terror of the law was often
mitigated by justice and by

00:42:36.079 --> 00:42:39.068
mercy,
but that was at the discretion

00:42:39.068 --> 00:42:41.014
of prosecutors,
of neighbors,

00:42:41.014 --> 00:42:44.465
of jury men and judges,
and it wasn't always

00:42:44.465 --> 00:42:45.840
forthcoming.
 

00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:50.378
There was no ultimate guarantee
that only the most guilty would

00:42:50.378 --> 00:42:54.260
be sentenced to a flogging or
the hangman's noose,

00:42:54.260 --> 00:42:58.240
and there's also evidence that
in those difficult generations

00:42:58.240 --> 00:43:01.956
in the last years of Elizabeth
and the early years of the

00:43:01.956 --> 00:43:05.320
Stuarts,
something of a greater punitive

00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:08.550
harshness was being used in the
courts.

00:43:08.550 --> 00:43:13.530
A harshness greater than that
that was later to be the case.

00:43:13.530 --> 00:43:17.759
I mean more prosecutions,
less use of benefit of clergy,

00:43:17.759 --> 00:43:19.989
and indeed more executions.
 

00:43:19.989 --> 00:43:22.884
In the final six years of
Elizabeth's reign at the county

00:43:22.884 --> 00:43:26.090
town of Chelmsford in Essex they
were hanging twenty-eight--

00:43:26.090 --> 00:43:31.070
twenty-six--people a year in
public.

00:43:31.070 --> 00:43:34.063
In the 1620s,
seventeen a year were being

00:43:34.063 --> 00:43:35.559
hanged at Chester.
 

00:43:35.559 --> 00:43:40.188
Between 1600 and 1610,
twenty-five a year were being

00:43:40.188 --> 00:43:43.909
hanged at Exeter down in the
southwest.

00:43:43.909 --> 00:43:48.905
It's been estimated that
perhaps 600 plus people were

00:43:48.905 --> 00:43:54.670
publicly hanged every year in
the last years of Elizabeth and

00:43:54.670 --> 00:43:58.130
the early years of King James I.
 

00:43:58.130 --> 00:44:01.822
And those are pretty high
figures by the standards of what

00:44:01.822 --> 00:44:05.989
we know about later periods,
especially the eighteenth and

00:44:05.989 --> 00:44:10.458
nineteenth centuries when most
counties saw only a handful of

00:44:10.458 --> 00:44:12.469
executions in each year.
 

00:44:12.469 --> 00:44:16.789
To give you a comparison which
might be more meaningful,

00:44:16.789 --> 00:44:22.143
I read yesterday in the
Times that in Texas there

00:44:22.143 --> 00:44:25.940
have been 334 executions since
1997,

00:44:25.940 --> 00:44:31.159
which works out at an average
of almost twenty-six a year,

00:44:31.159 --> 00:44:34.380
the same figure as were being
hanged in Chelmsford,

00:44:34.380 --> 00:44:38.510
Essex in 1597.
 

00:44:38.510 --> 00:44:41.469
But Essex had a population of
approximately 100,000;

00:44:41.469 --> 00:44:45.920
Texas has a population of 26
million.

00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:50.757
So in other words,
the rate per million in Texas

00:44:50.757 --> 00:44:56.829
of executions annually is just
over one, one per million.

00:44:56.829 --> 00:45:05.849
The rate in late Elizabethan
England was 150 per million.

00:45:05.849 --> 00:45:09.777
The point I'm making,
obviously, is that despite the

00:45:09.777 --> 00:45:14.246
many mitigating circumstances
which were used England still

00:45:14.246 --> 00:45:18.561
had a pretty bloody criminal
code and it was still pretty

00:45:18.561 --> 00:45:21.601
bloodily enforced;
on hardened evildoers

00:45:21.601 --> 00:45:24.777
certainly, but also perhaps
sometimes on those who simply

00:45:24.777 --> 00:45:27.500
didn't have the position or the
connections,

00:45:27.500 --> 00:45:31.121
who were outsiders,
who were vagrants and could not

00:45:31.121 --> 00:45:35.469
escape the rigor of the law
through the use of discretion.

00:45:35.469 --> 00:45:38.742
We mustn't exaggerate the
ferocity of the law,

00:45:38.742 --> 00:45:43.179
but equally we mustn't forget
its very harsh realities in this

00:45:43.179 --> 00:45:43.980
period.
 

00:45:43.980 --> 00:45:48.487
At its very heart were not only
certain social ideals of justice

00:45:48.487 --> 00:45:51.849
regarding who most deserved such
punishment,

00:45:51.849 --> 00:45:55.958
but also what's been described
as "the logic of exemplary

00:45:55.958 --> 00:45:57.239
punishment."
 

00:45:57.239 --> 00:46:01.306
They believed that since they
could not deal with all crime

00:46:01.306 --> 00:46:03.690
they must make examples of some.
 

00:46:03.690 --> 00:46:11.070
And they did on a scale which
by modern standards is shocking.

00:46:11.070 --> 00:46:19.380
There we can leave it.
 

00:46:19.380 --> 00:46:22.090
Next time I'll go on to look at
another aspect of order,

00:46:22.090 --> 00:46:27.110
the small-scale forms of
popular protest,

00:46:27.110 --> 00:46:31.050
demonstrations and riots which
one finds in this period.

00:46:31.050 --> 00:46:37.000

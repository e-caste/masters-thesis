00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:04.855
Prof: Okay,
I want today to talk about

00:00:04.855 --> 00:00:07.423
collaboration,
but above all,

00:00:07.423 --> 00:00:11.550
resistance in Europe during
World War II.

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.073
I'll talk mostly about France,
because that's where there's

00:00:15.073 --> 00:00:20.104
been so much written about,
and also because France coming

00:00:20.104 --> 00:00:26.510
to grips with the Vichy past was
not an evident thing.

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:28.470
It was something that took a
long time.

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.669
There was a process of sort of
collective and official

00:00:33.669 --> 00:00:37.300
repression about what had
happened.

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.510
I want to talk about that.
 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.090
Again, histories have their
histories.

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.782
I've been around here long
enough that I can remember all

00:00:47.782 --> 00:00:49.510
this happening.
 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.037
Not the war,
obviously, thank you,

00:00:52.037 --> 00:00:55.330
but France coming to grips with
its past.

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:56.970
I want to talk about that.
 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:58.660
We haven't talked about France
in a long time.

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:59.950
I'm going to talk about that.
 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:01.630
But first let me just say a
couple things.

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:07.420
Other countries had their
resistors as well.

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.447
It was obviously--the most
successful case of resistance

00:01:11.447 --> 00:01:13.500
was that of ex-Yugoslavia.
 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:20.970
Well before the end of the war,
Marshal Tito and his partisans,

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:27.049
taking advantage of the
mountains of ex-Yugoslavia,

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:30.260
were able to pin down entire
German divisions,

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.790
and with weapons parachuted in
by the allies,

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.330
and with entire moving
hospitals,

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:42.209
were able to launch the most
effective resistance,

00:01:42.209 --> 00:01:44.849
arguably, in Europe.
 

00:01:44.849 --> 00:01:47.328
Of course, the case of the
Soviet Union,

00:01:47.328 --> 00:01:49.489
twenty-five million people
died.

00:01:49.489 --> 00:01:53.294
Twenty-five million people died
in World War II,

00:01:53.294 --> 00:01:57.260
most of them in the war,
but lots also in Stalin's

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:58.069
camps.
 

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:03.248
A lot of partisans lost their
lives picking off German

00:02:03.248 --> 00:02:06.569
soldiers, in the case of Poland.
 

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:10.870
In the third edition there will
be more on this.

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:13.598
They got scarcely a mention.
 

00:02:13.598 --> 00:02:16.982
The Polish had a home army,
as they called it,

00:02:16.982 --> 00:02:20.590
of about 300,000 people by the
end of the war.

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:27.888
The Warsaw ghetto rose up,
and was crushed with 12,000

00:02:27.888 --> 00:02:32.570
deaths and with thousands of
other people sent away to the

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.960
camps in 1943,
then the Warsaw uprising.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.660
One of the reasons that Warsaw,
where I'll be on Friday,

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.758
and where I go fairly
often--there was nothing left,

00:02:42.758 --> 00:02:45.288
because the uprising was
crushed,

00:02:45.288 --> 00:02:49.900
and thousands and thousands of
people lost their lives.

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.513
I just reviewed a book actually
for the Boston Globe

00:02:54.513 --> 00:02:58.758
called Ghettostadt,
which is an interesting book by

00:02:58.758 --> 00:03:02.150
a man called Gordon Horowitz,
who teaches in Illinois.

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:07.628
It's about the Lodz ghetto.
 

00:03:07.628 --> 00:03:11.508
It's a tragic,
all-to-familiar tale.

00:03:11.508 --> 00:03:13.069
It doesn't have anything to do
with resistance,

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:15.974
because it was impossible,
but it was about the German

00:03:15.974 --> 00:03:18.639
ideas of creating this Aryan
city in Lodz,

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:21.330
which was a big industrial
town, and still is,

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:22.199
in Poland.
 

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:25.712
Of course, what they did is
they put all the Jews into the

00:03:25.712 --> 00:03:28.691
ghetto,
which was several kilometers

00:03:28.691 --> 00:03:31.205
square,
and put them to work making

00:03:31.205 --> 00:03:32.910
uniforms,
and ear muffs,

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:34.568
and all sorts of things for the
German troops.

00:03:34.568 --> 00:03:37.360
In the story,
the most horrific aspect of it

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.190
is that the people in the
ghetto, they don't really know.

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.508
There's all these rumors about
what's happening outside.

00:03:43.508 --> 00:03:46.751
Of course, what's happening is
the killing fields,

00:03:46.751 --> 00:03:50.322
and three million Jews
disappear in Poland in World War

00:03:50.322 --> 00:03:52.770
II, three million,
three million.

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:59.467
Gradually, and some people,
before they are being killed by

00:03:59.467 --> 00:04:02.530
the Nazis,
are forced to write cheery

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.570
postcards saying,
"All is well here in these

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:05.889
camps.
 

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:07.060
Everything is just
delightful."

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:08.270
Then they're executed.
 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:11.342
Gradually, it's about the
mounting horror of the people

00:04:11.342 --> 00:04:12.310
who live there.
 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:15.591
They see clothes stacked up
outside the ghetto that they

00:04:15.591 --> 00:04:18.574
could recognize as having been
on people they knew,

00:04:18.574 --> 00:04:21.139
who had been shipped away to
the camps.

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:25.870
The whole thing is so
horrendous.

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:27.339
It lives with us today.
 

00:04:27.339 --> 00:04:33.702
Obviously, it was easier to
resist in places in which you

00:04:33.702 --> 00:04:35.180
could hide.
 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.781
When I talk about France,
the reason--and I sent this

00:04:37.781 --> 00:04:39.994
term around--you called the
French resistors the

00:04:39.994 --> 00:04:43.519
maquisards,
or even just les maquis,

00:04:43.519 --> 00:04:46.915
is because they were able to
hide behind brush called

00:04:46.915 --> 00:04:47.959
maquis.
 

00:04:47.959 --> 00:04:49.370
More about this later.
 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.197
So, resistance in Belgium,
which is in the flat country

00:04:52.197 --> 00:04:54.870
except for the Ardennes was
very, very difficult.

00:04:54.870 --> 00:05:03.100
There's hardly a hill that's
more than a hump in Denmark,

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:06.699
but yet is was the Danes in
Copenhagen who saved the Jews,

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:09.100
who got them out,
with the help of a German

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:13.379
officer,
and were able to get them just

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:19.910
across the very narrow straits
to Malmo in Sweden.

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:23.040
Other countries had their
resistances as well.

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:25.896
All those can't be covered now
in this short amount of

00:05:25.896 --> 00:05:28.428
time--why am I supposed to have
this glass here,

00:05:28.428 --> 00:05:29.129
actually?
 

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:30.149
It has a label on it.
 

00:05:30.149 --> 00:05:35.163
I'm not supposed to have this
glass here at all--I guess what

00:05:35.163 --> 00:05:39.675
I'll do is I'm going to talk
about France and about the

00:05:39.675 --> 00:05:41.430
resistance there.
 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:47.990
Now, until about 1969,
a year that I can remember,

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:56.829
Altamont, the Mets win the
series, but more important,

00:05:56.829 --> 00:06:01.735
protests against the war in the
United States and mounting

00:06:01.735 --> 00:06:06.209
dissatisfaction with United
States foreign policy.

00:06:06.209 --> 00:06:07.740
I can remember that very,
very well.

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:11.850
But until 1969,
in France the official line was

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:15.603
virtually everybody resisted,
a few elites,

00:06:15.603 --> 00:06:19.267
a few notables,
rural elites collaborated,

00:06:19.267 --> 00:06:20.430
period.
 

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:24.725
The official line was one that
was very closely tied to

00:06:24.725 --> 00:06:25.600
Gaullism.
 

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:30.702
Because Charles de Gaulle,
the big guy,

00:06:30.702 --> 00:06:35.940
his voice crackles over June
18,1940.

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:37.750
He calls on France to resist.
 

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:41.480
Part of the myth that everybody
resisted,

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:43.829
or almost everybody,
and few people collaborated,

00:06:43.829 --> 00:06:45.920
had to do with the official
Gaullist policy,

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:48.490
which is that Gaullists
resisted.

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:52.613
Charles de Gaulle,
this mystical body of Charles

00:06:52.613 --> 00:06:55.906
de Gaulle,
the body being greater than the

00:06:55.906 --> 00:06:58.509
sum of all its parts,
led France,

00:06:58.509 --> 00:07:00.629
which essentially liberated
itself.

00:07:00.629 --> 00:07:03.519
Of course, that's simply not
true.

00:07:03.519 --> 00:07:07.035
Also, what that forgot about
was the fact that the communists

00:07:07.035 --> 00:07:09.730
were enormously important in the
resistance.

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:11.250
More about that in a while.
 

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:13.439
There was a film made,
a documentary,

00:07:13.439 --> 00:07:14.899
I think in about 1953.
 

00:07:14.899 --> 00:07:16.230
I've never actually seen it.
 

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:18.069
It had to do with the Jews.
 

00:07:18.069 --> 00:07:20.800
It had to do with what happened
to the Jews in France.

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:24.024
It was conveniently forgotten
that the Jews in Paris who were

00:07:24.024 --> 00:07:26.550
arrested,
in the Marais,

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:30.860
in the Jewish section of Paris,
and in other places, too,

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:32.459
were arrested by the French
police.

00:07:32.459 --> 00:07:34.322
The Germans would have been
happy to do it,

00:07:34.322 --> 00:07:36.716
but they didn't need to,
because the French police were

00:07:36.716 --> 00:07:37.779
so eager to do that.
 

00:07:37.779 --> 00:07:41.740
In this film,
Jews and other people,

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:43.870
communists and other people who
were sent away,

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:46.377
were packed off to a place
called Drancy,

00:07:46.377 --> 00:07:49.451
which is,
if you've ever taken the RER in

00:07:49.451 --> 00:07:53.420
from the airport or to the
Roissy airport in Paris,

00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:54.490
you've gone through Drancy.
 

00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:55.569
That was a transit camp.
 

00:07:55.569 --> 00:07:58.322
In transit camps,
rather like Malines or

00:07:58.322 --> 00:08:02.865
Mechelen, in Belgium,
or Westerbok in the Netherlands

00:08:02.865 --> 00:08:09.586
quite near the German border,
these camps were run by French,

00:08:09.586 --> 00:08:13.740
Belgians, and Dutch,
They were not run by the Nazis.

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:16.310
The Nazis would have been happy
to do it, but the local

00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:18.930
populations, the local
collaborators were doing that.

00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:21.709
In this film made in 1953,
in the original,

00:08:21.709 --> 00:08:25.613
you see a French gendarme who's
guarding the Jews at Drancy,

00:08:25.613 --> 00:08:27.069
isn't in the film.
 

00:08:27.069 --> 00:08:31.329
In the documentary that was
finally released,

00:08:31.329 --> 00:08:36.750
somebody has reached in and
plucked him from the film.

00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:38.960
He simply disappears.
 

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:40.600
It's doctored.
 

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:44.320
The French gendarme,
with his French gendarme hat,

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:49.865
isn't in the film,
because the myth was that the

00:08:49.865 --> 00:08:53.870
Jews were taken away by the
Germans,

00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:56.178
and that communist resistors
were shot by the Germans,

00:08:56.178 --> 00:08:59.809
and the gypsies and gay people
were taken away by the Germans,

00:08:59.809 --> 00:09:03.210
were arrested by the Germans,
and that France resisted and

00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:04.210
didn't collaborate.
 

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:08.000
Now, two events--let me also
tell you two stories.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.485
I hope I didn't say this the
first day when I was trying to

00:09:11.485 --> 00:09:14.610
get you interested in learning
about World War II.

00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:17.750
I worked in a place called
Tulle when I was doing my

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:21.139
research for my dissertation,
long ago, and all that.

00:09:21.139 --> 00:09:24.937
I didn't have any money,
and I'd go down and buy an ice

00:09:24.937 --> 00:09:27.259
cream cone for lunch every day.
 

00:09:27.259 --> 00:09:29.735
I started talking to this guy
and I didn't speak French very

00:09:29.735 --> 00:09:30.240
well then.
 

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:33.879
But I knew that there were a
lot of people hung there.

00:09:33.879 --> 00:09:35.700
Ninety-nine men were hung.
 

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:39.980
The Germans left.
 

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:41.422
The maquis,
the resistors,

00:09:41.422 --> 00:09:42.548
were very active there.
 

00:09:42.548 --> 00:09:44.841
André
Malraux, the great writer,

00:09:44.841 --> 00:09:47.918
was active in a place called
Argentat near there.

00:09:47.918 --> 00:09:50.201
One day the Germans all left,
and then everybody came out and

00:09:50.201 --> 00:09:51.950
started partying,
and the Germans came back.

00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:55.460
They hung ninety-nine men from
poles in Tulle.

00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:58.721
One day I was there and this
guy was telling me this story

00:09:58.721 --> 00:10:00.210
about how he had hidden.
 

00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:04.044
He had gone up--it's a real
windy town in a valley--he'd

00:10:04.044 --> 00:10:05.509
gone up and hidden.
 

00:10:05.509 --> 00:10:08.779
You've got a house here and
you've got room under the house.

00:10:08.779 --> 00:10:10.418
He was able to hide and escape.
 

00:10:10.418 --> 00:10:12.379
Because he was sixteen,
he would have been hung.

00:10:12.379 --> 00:10:16.870
This woman came up and I was
eating my ice cream cone.

00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:18.038
She ordered an ice cream cone.
 

00:10:18.038 --> 00:10:20.104
The guy suddenly said,
"Madame Dupont,

00:10:20.104 --> 00:10:22.120
you remember that day,
don't you?"

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:23.399
She said, "I sure do.
 

00:10:23.399 --> 00:10:24.840
They hung my husband from that
pole."

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:29.924
How every day you could live
with that and talk about that as

00:10:29.924 --> 00:10:35.519
if you were discussing where you
had bought something at a sale.

00:10:35.519 --> 00:10:39.000
But the next step to thinking
about that is who in France made

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.600
all those things possible?
 

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:42.710
Who was helping the Germans do
that?

00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:47.038
The answer is that lots of
people collaborated.

00:10:47.038 --> 00:10:49.533
Lots of people got what they
wanted on a platter because of

00:10:49.533 --> 00:10:50.350
the Nazi victory.
 

00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:52.470
The same people who were
shrieking "Better Hitler

00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:53.190
than Blum!"
 

00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:57.049
in 1936 got exactly what they
wanted.

00:10:57.049 --> 00:11:00.259
Marshal Pétain,
who was a rabid anti-Semite,

00:11:00.259 --> 00:11:04.644
his national revolution was
essentially aimed to do in

00:11:04.644 --> 00:11:08.120
France what Hitler had done in
Germany,

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:11.120
and what other petty despots
had done in other places,

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:13.639
some not so petty, like Hitler.
 

00:11:13.639 --> 00:11:14.940
They got what they wanted.
 

00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:19.470
So, how did the official line
get shaken by reality?

00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:21.769
How did this happen?
 

00:11:21.769 --> 00:11:23.000
Second story.
 

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.250
I have a friend who is still a
lawyer in Paris.

00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:27.629
I've known him for a long,
long, long time.

00:11:27.629 --> 00:11:30.350
He was too young to remember,
but his older brother,

00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:32.626
who's dead now,
remembered when the Germans

00:11:32.626 --> 00:11:34.308
came to his house in the
suburbs,

00:11:34.308 --> 00:11:36.080
a place called Le
Perreux-sur-Marne,

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:38.529
took away the father,
who was a Greek Jew.

00:11:38.529 --> 00:11:41.340
Of course, he was taken away
and was killed.

00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:42.870
He ended up in one of the camps.
 

00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:43.960
They don't know what happened
to him.

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:46.950
Now, the Germans just didn't
come to that house by chance.

00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:51.639
The guy was denounced as a Jew
by the policeman in that town.

00:11:51.639 --> 00:11:54.610
After the war,
every Saturday when this lady,

00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:58.393
the widow, went to the market,
she walked by and saw this

00:11:58.393 --> 00:12:01.500
policeman directing traffic,
the same guy.

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:03.340
Nothing ever happened to him.
 

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:05.860
Nothing ever happened to him.
 

00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:09.465
So, how did the official
version get eliminated by

00:12:09.465 --> 00:12:11.009
historical reality?
 

00:12:11.009 --> 00:12:12.669
Histories have their histories.
 

00:12:12.669 --> 00:12:14.210
How did that happen?
 

00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:16.210
There are two events that are
kind of key.

00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:17.940
They're both in what I sent
around.

00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:21.158
One is the movie,
The Sorrow and the Pity,

00:12:21.158 --> 00:12:22.288
which I mentioned in here
before,

00:12:22.288 --> 00:12:25.365
which was described as a two
six-pack movie in the old days

00:12:25.365 --> 00:12:28.573
when I used to show it here,
because it lasts four and a

00:12:28.573 --> 00:12:29.269
half hours.
 

00:12:29.269 --> 00:12:33.461
It was a documentary made for
French television by Max

00:12:33.461 --> 00:12:34.570
Ophüls.
 

00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:37.620
It was never shown on French
television until 1981.

00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:38.720
Why?
 

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:42.482
Because it was a documentary in
which collaborators--there's

00:12:42.482 --> 00:12:46.629
sort of a local notable called
Christian De la Mazière,

00:12:46.629 --> 00:12:50.038
who describes in his smoking,
his smoking,

00:12:50.038 --> 00:12:51.690
in his fancy jacket in the
château,

00:12:51.690 --> 00:12:55.750
why he fought alongside the
Nazis on the Eastern Front in

00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:56.908
the Waffen SS.
 

00:12:56.908 --> 00:13:02.089
It's about collaboration and
resistance, tales of true

00:13:02.089 --> 00:13:05.899
heroism but also of repressed
memory.

00:13:05.899 --> 00:13:08.041
There's a great scene in which
they're walking through the

00:13:08.041 --> 00:13:08.379
school.
 

00:13:08.379 --> 00:13:12.139
They ask about the teacher,
a teacher who disappeared.

00:13:12.139 --> 00:13:13.298
They don't even remember about
it.

00:13:13.298 --> 00:13:14.894
They don't remember it,
the guys that are being

00:13:14.894 --> 00:13:15.379
interviewed.
 

00:13:15.379 --> 00:13:17.240
They've conveniently forgotten.
 

00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:22.495
So, The Sorrow and the
Pity was never shown on

00:13:22.495 --> 00:13:24.820
French TV until 1981.
 

00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:27.570
It's a fantastic thing.
 

00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:29.110
It's too long,
and I should have never shown

00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:29.288
it.
 

00:13:29.288 --> 00:13:32.620
I started showing it twice in
sections.

00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:35.684
Also, it's kind of dubbed and
it's very hard to understand

00:13:35.684 --> 00:13:37.460
either in French or in English.
 

00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:39.080
It's a monument.
 

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:42.109
It's a monument not just
because it's a driving,

00:13:42.109 --> 00:13:45.461
forceful documentary,
but it helped France rediscover

00:13:45.461 --> 00:13:46.299
its past.
 

00:13:46.299 --> 00:13:48.240
Fabulous.
 

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:50.820
Talking about the role of the
Communist Party.

00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:53.317
Again, I'm not a communist,
but I'm telling you,

00:13:53.317 --> 00:13:56.558
the Communist Party had an
enormous role in the resistance.

00:13:56.558 --> 00:14:00.530
Most of it's about
Clermont-Ferrand,

00:14:00.530 --> 00:14:01.778
the area.
 

00:14:01.778 --> 00:14:05.840
It's based on the Auvergne town
of Clermont-Ferrand.

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:09.538
There's this great scene where
these two peasants out in the

00:14:09.538 --> 00:14:12.058
countryside say,
"Nous sommes rouge,

00:14:12.058 --> 00:14:14.076
comme le vin,"
"We're red like the wine

00:14:14.076 --> 00:14:14.970
we're drinking."
 

00:14:14.970 --> 00:14:18.480
It's a fabulous,
fabulous, fabulous thing.

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:21.804
Of course, there's the
inevitable scene at the end

00:14:21.804 --> 00:14:24.860
where women who were called,
indelicately,

00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:27.236
"horizontal
collaborators,"

00:14:27.236 --> 00:14:31.528
had their heads shaved and were
being paraded through the town.

00:14:31.528 --> 00:14:32.740
That happened all over the
place.

00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:35.298
Les tondeuses is what
you called them in French.

00:14:35.298 --> 00:14:36.798
It doesn't matter what you call
it in French.

00:14:36.798 --> 00:14:40.600
In the end, there's Maurice
Chevalier.

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:44.354
Your grandparents will know who
Maurice Chevalier was,

00:14:44.354 --> 00:14:48.533
because he kind of represented,
in the American imagination,

00:14:48.533 --> 00:14:49.950
what France was.
 

00:14:49.950 --> 00:14:50.899
He was a crooner.
 

00:14:50.899 --> 00:14:54.548
He was a singer who was born in
L'Aiguillon-sur-Mer,

00:14:54.548 --> 00:14:57.460
which is in a proletarian edge
of Paris,

00:14:57.460 --> 00:15:00.590
right near where Edith Piaf,
the singer, was,

00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:01.879
whom your grandparents would
have heard of also,

00:15:01.879 --> 00:15:03.370
people way before my time.
 

00:15:03.370 --> 00:15:07.159
But at the end of the movie
they have him and he's wearing

00:15:07.159 --> 00:15:10.284
his little crooning suit and he
says in English,

00:15:10.284 --> 00:15:12.995
"Well,
you know there are zees

00:15:12.995 --> 00:15:15.740
rumors that I was singing for
zee Germans.

00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:18.296
But I just want to tell you
that I was only singing for

00:15:18.296 --> 00:15:20.711
zee boys,"
that is, for the prisoners of

00:15:20.711 --> 00:15:21.090
war.
 

00:15:21.090 --> 00:15:24.879
He was dealing with his own
past as well.

00:15:24.879 --> 00:15:29.631
Francois Mitterrand,
president of France for

00:15:29.631 --> 00:15:32.039
fourteen years beginning in
1981,

00:15:32.039 --> 00:15:36.783
when he was inaugurated,
the cameras follow him through

00:15:36.783 --> 00:15:38.250
the Panthéon.
 

00:15:38.250 --> 00:15:41.753
He follows him by where the
heart or some part of Jean

00:15:41.753 --> 00:15:43.340
Jaurès is left.
 

00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:45.806
But Francois Mitterrand,
when he was dying,

00:15:45.806 --> 00:15:47.980
he came to grips with his own
past.

00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:50.227
When he was dying,
he too, like France,

00:15:50.227 --> 00:15:53.895
said, "There was a moment
when I was not a resistor,"

00:15:53.895 --> 00:15:55.730
which he became a resistor.
 

00:15:55.730 --> 00:15:59.110
But there was a moment that he
had celebrated Vichy,

00:15:59.110 --> 00:16:02.410
and somebody had found a
picture of him in a right-wing

00:16:02.410 --> 00:16:05.701
rally in 1936 or 1937,
of which there were many in

00:16:05.701 --> 00:16:06.158
Paris.
 

00:16:06.158 --> 00:16:08.168
He, too, came to grips with his
past.

00:16:08.168 --> 00:16:11.640
This all started,
the history of history started

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:12.750
in the 1970s.
 

00:16:12.750 --> 00:16:18.264
The second event was a book
published by my good friend

00:16:18.264 --> 00:16:19.899
Robert Paxton.
 

00:16:19.899 --> 00:16:23.620
He's about ten years older than
me, probably more than that.

00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:29.460
He wrote a book called Vichy
France, published in 1972.

00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:33.923
Vichy France could not
use French archives,

00:16:33.923 --> 00:16:36.928
because they weren't available.
 

00:16:36.928 --> 00:16:39.470
There's a fifty-year rule in
French archives.

00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:41.094
But there's also a
site--talking about the

00:16:41.094 --> 00:16:42.861
mutinies,
that the mutinies weren't

00:16:42.861 --> 00:16:45.240
available well after fifty years
had passed,

00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:48.570
after the mutinies in World War
I.

00:16:48.570 --> 00:16:52.245
So, he used captured German
documents, not French documents

00:16:52.245 --> 00:16:54.779
because they weren't available
to him.

00:16:54.779 --> 00:16:59.597
What he did in this book was to
show what Vichy and

00:16:59.597 --> 00:17:04.609
Pétain's national
revolution thought they were

00:17:04.609 --> 00:17:08.680
doing, and why many,
many people collaborated.

00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:12.036
There's a more recent book by a
guy called Philip Burrin that I

00:17:12.036 --> 00:17:15.230
use in the seminar on Vichy that
I do from time to time,

00:17:15.230 --> 00:17:19.108
a junior seminar,
which explores more deeply,

00:17:19.108 --> 00:17:21.000
using these archives that are
now available,

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.880
the whole question of
collaboration.

00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:27.704
But the point that Paxton made
is that he demolished the shield

00:17:27.704 --> 00:17:31.518
argument,
the argument that Pétain

00:17:31.518 --> 00:17:36.809
and the national revolution had
saved the French State,

00:17:36.809 --> 00:17:38.880
and that they were a shield.
 

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:41.106
If it wasn't for Vichy,
worse things would have

00:17:41.106 --> 00:17:41.640
happened.
 

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:47.885
When Maurice Papon, P-A-P-O-N,
went on trial over eighty years

00:17:47.885 --> 00:17:50.318
of age,
went on trial for having signed

00:17:50.318 --> 00:17:53.702
away the lives of many Jews in
Bordeaux where he worked in the

00:17:53.702 --> 00:17:54.480
prefecture.
 

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:56.480
He made the same argument.
 

00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:58.000
He said, "I was a good
bureaucrat.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.880
My superiors liked me.
 

00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:02.675
If it hadn't been for me,
more Jews would have been

00:18:02.675 --> 00:18:05.249
shipped away to Drancy"
or, more directly,

00:18:05.249 --> 00:18:06.200
to the camps.
 

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:08.089
He was condemned.
 

00:18:08.089 --> 00:18:10.549
He died a couple years ago.
 

00:18:10.549 --> 00:18:11.920
He was under house arrest.
 

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:15.496
The most amazing part of the
whole trial was he managed to

00:18:15.496 --> 00:18:16.940
escape at age eighty.
 

00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:19.327
People drove him to the Swiss
border and they found him in a

00:18:19.327 --> 00:18:21.190
fancy Swiss restaurant and
brought him back.

00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:25.680
But Papon had gone on to a very
distinguished career as a

00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:29.528
bureaucrat in the Fourth and
Fifth republics,

00:18:29.528 --> 00:18:32.650
as did a lot of other
salauds,

00:18:32.650 --> 00:18:35.980
a lot of other bastards,
such as René Bousquet,

00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:38.608
who was a prefecture police.
 

00:18:38.608 --> 00:18:42.220
The argument was the shield
argument.

00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:43.705
"If it wasn't for us,
things would have been

00:18:43.705 --> 00:18:44.140
worse."
 

00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:47.573
But as Paxton wrote very,
very memorably,

00:18:47.573 --> 00:18:51.950
Pétain might have
provided continuity for the

00:18:51.950 --> 00:18:56.068
French state,
but not for the French nation.

00:18:56.068 --> 00:18:58.272
The French nation,
what was and is,

00:18:58.272 --> 00:19:01.189
I hope and I'm proud to say,
based on liberty,

00:19:01.189 --> 00:19:02.808
fraternity, equality.
 

00:19:02.808 --> 00:19:10.198
They take those off the coins
and it becomes "family,

00:19:10.198 --> 00:19:13.048
country, work."
 

00:19:13.048 --> 00:19:16.368
It used to be when I was there
when I was a kid,

00:19:16.368 --> 00:19:20.113
you could see still these
little coins from Vichy that

00:19:20.113 --> 00:19:23.078
they transformed into
centimes.

00:19:23.078 --> 00:19:27.058
Paxton's book--I saw him once
when I was in Brussels.

00:19:27.058 --> 00:19:29.528
I saw him on a TV show,
my wife and I did.

00:19:29.528 --> 00:19:31.740
It was one of those typical
French shows,

00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:35.528
where it will be about World
War II and they'll have somebody

00:19:35.528 --> 00:19:38.660
who remembered the war,
somebody who was in the war,

00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:41.559
somebody who didn't even know
what was going on,

00:19:41.559 --> 00:19:43.210
and all this stuff,
and they interview them.

00:19:43.210 --> 00:19:45.371
Some guy got up,
this sort of rightwing guy,

00:19:45.371 --> 00:19:47.986
and there was protesting
against Paxton's presence by

00:19:47.986 --> 00:19:48.690
skinheads.
 

00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:50.451
They got up and said,
"Mr. Paxton,

00:19:50.451 --> 00:19:52.630
what could you possibly know
about the war?

00:19:52.630 --> 00:19:54.710
You were only twelve years old
during the war?"

00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:57.587
But Paxton became,
this was an important part of

00:19:57.587 --> 00:19:59.118
the history of history.
 

00:19:59.118 --> 00:20:03.876
When he was introduced at the
Sorbonne, he was introduced by a

00:20:03.876 --> 00:20:07.308
historian called Jean-Pierre
Azéma.

00:20:07.308 --> 00:20:09.128
When he introduced him,
he said, "Messr.

00:20:09.128 --> 00:20:10.640
Paxton, dans un certain
sens,

00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:13.125
vous êtes le conscience
de la France,"

00:20:13.125 --> 00:20:15.038
"In a certain sense you,
Paxton,

00:20:15.038 --> 00:20:16.298
are the conscience of
France."

00:20:16.298 --> 00:20:21.519
These two events are important
in the emergence of what the

00:20:21.519 --> 00:20:27.098
historian Henry Rousso calls the
"Vichy Syndrome."

00:20:27.098 --> 00:20:30.078
Vichy was conveniently
forgotten,

00:20:30.078 --> 00:20:33.940
because of Gaullism or because
of not wanting to remember the

00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:38.069
bad things that had happened,
the collaborators,

00:20:38.069 --> 00:20:40.700
the eager anti-Semites.
 

00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:47.509
Now, since the early 1970s,
people are obsessed with Vichy.

00:20:47.509 --> 00:20:51.423
There's all sorts of good work
that's been done on Vichy,

00:20:51.423 --> 00:20:55.269
and the whole period of
resistance and collaboration.

00:20:55.269 --> 00:20:58.875
Paxton estimated in that book
that two percent of the French

00:20:58.875 --> 00:21:00.220
population resisted.
 

00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:03.017
My friend John Sweets,
who did a book called

00:21:03.017 --> 00:21:06.238
Choices in Vichy France,
a great title in which he

00:21:06.238 --> 00:21:09.209
looked at Clermont-Ferrand,
because that was where the

00:21:09.209 --> 00:21:11.430
movie The Sorrow and the
Pity were focused on.

00:21:11.430 --> 00:21:13.740
He estimates,
depending on how you define

00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:15.997
resistance,
people that refused to get off

00:21:15.997 --> 00:21:18.118
the sidewalk when a German
officer passed,

00:21:18.118 --> 00:21:20.700
or people that whistled in the
documentaries,

00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:25.509
the German newsreels before the
movie, and the theater,

00:21:25.509 --> 00:21:29.573
that something like sixteen or
eighteen percent of the

00:21:29.573 --> 00:21:31.259
population resisted.
 

00:21:31.259 --> 00:21:34.259
It's a more charitable
definition of resistance.

00:21:34.259 --> 00:21:36.760
The fact is,
and I won't talk too much more

00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:39.799
about this, but the
collaboration was widespread.

00:21:39.799 --> 00:21:41.779
It was not simply an elite.
 

00:21:41.779 --> 00:21:45.058
The elites were more apt to
collaborate earlier in the war.

00:21:45.058 --> 00:21:48.259
Later in the war the kinds of
people who joined the militia,

00:21:48.259 --> 00:21:53.798
which formed in January 1943,
which was the French equivalent

00:21:53.798 --> 00:21:57.332
of the Gestapo,
tended to be sort of down and

00:21:57.332 --> 00:21:57.798
out.
 

00:21:57.798 --> 00:22:01.278
They were the kinds of people
who in Germany joined the SS,

00:22:01.278 --> 00:22:04.400
many of them in the 1920s,
saw it as a form of social

00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:05.180
mobility.
 

00:22:05.180 --> 00:22:07.488
There's a really good film
called Lacombe Lucien,

00:22:07.488 --> 00:22:10.006
that I haven't seen in years,
about somebody who--between his

00:22:10.006 --> 00:22:11.348
ears there wasn't very much.
 

00:22:11.348 --> 00:22:14.305
The resistance doesn't want him
because he's just kind of an

00:22:14.305 --> 00:22:16.308
idiot who doesn't believe in
anything.

00:22:16.308 --> 00:22:20.210
But the militia's very happy to
have him, and it's about what

00:22:20.210 --> 00:22:23.069
happens to him in the southwest
of France.

00:22:23.069 --> 00:22:26.628
During the Papon trial,
which was maybe about eight

00:22:26.628 --> 00:22:28.108
years ago,
or something like that,

00:22:28.108 --> 00:22:31.567
there was one time they
interviewed a German officer who

00:22:31.567 --> 00:22:32.700
was still alive.
 

00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:35.997
They said, "Look,
what are your memories of Papon

00:22:35.997 --> 00:22:37.490
and the militia?"
 

00:22:37.490 --> 00:22:40.085
He said, "If we got a
gar, a guy,

00:22:40.085 --> 00:22:43.328
if we arrested a French guy and
we rather liked him,

00:22:43.328 --> 00:22:44.769
we wouldn't turn him over to
the militia,

00:22:44.769 --> 00:22:47.140
because they would torture him
so hideously."

00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:49.957
Of course, the Germans were
capable of and did all over the

00:22:49.957 --> 00:22:52.578
place torture people hideously,
no doubt about that.

00:22:52.578 --> 00:22:56.269
But the militia were generally
bad, bad, bad guys.

00:22:56.269 --> 00:23:02.618
You saw this in Lacombe,
Lucien a little bit.

00:23:02.618 --> 00:23:05.443
That restaurant scene is so
crucial in Lacombe

00:23:05.443 --> 00:23:06.210
Lucien.
 

00:23:06.210 --> 00:23:10.131
That is really the essence of
that film, in Lacombe,

00:23:10.131 --> 00:23:14.269
Lucien, the restaurant
scene when they're in there.

00:23:14.269 --> 00:23:17.680
Collaborators were everywhere.
 

00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:22.378
At the end of the war probably
about 25,000 people were

00:23:22.378 --> 00:23:27.338
executed after very short trials
or simply gunned down.

00:23:27.338 --> 00:23:29.644
Near where we live in
Ardèche,

00:23:29.644 --> 00:23:33.420
there was a priest in a village
not too far away from us.

00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:37.614
He had Déat--;I think it
was him-- who was a real

00:23:37.614 --> 00:23:39.140
fascist, to lunch.
 

00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:41.626
After the war,
they put him up against his own

00:23:41.626 --> 00:23:43.230
church and gunned him down.
 

00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:47.432
I have an acquaintance a long
time ago who worked in the

00:23:47.432 --> 00:23:51.328
archives in Limoges,
where I spent a lot of time.

00:23:51.328 --> 00:23:55.186
He was a young man then,
and was a refugee from

00:23:55.186 --> 00:23:56.108
Lorraine.
 

00:23:56.108 --> 00:23:58.430
After the war everybody was
celebrating.

00:23:58.430 --> 00:24:02.897
He lived in a place called
Saint-Léonard-de-Noblat,

00:24:02.897 --> 00:24:04.778
which is near Limoges.
 

00:24:04.778 --> 00:24:08.942
They were all partying in this
little town that's twelve

00:24:08.942 --> 00:24:11.288
kilometers away from Limoges.
 

00:24:11.288 --> 00:24:12.871
Somebody said,
"Where's the gendarme who

00:24:12.871 --> 00:24:14.130
sold people down the
river?"

00:24:14.130 --> 00:24:15.494
Someone said,
"He's got an aunt in

00:24:15.494 --> 00:24:16.068
Limoges."
 

00:24:16.068 --> 00:24:18.880
So they left all the casts of
wine that were left.

00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:22.011
They marched into Limoges,
went to the aunt's house,

00:24:22.011 --> 00:24:23.528
got the guy,
hauled him out,

00:24:23.528 --> 00:24:27.038
put him at the beginning of
this procession,

00:24:27.038 --> 00:24:30.319
joyous but also a deadly
serious procession,

00:24:30.319 --> 00:24:37.614
sort of an enraged charivari,
and they got him back to where

00:24:37.614 --> 00:24:39.430
he had done great damage.
 

00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:40.950
They put him against the wall
and prrrt.

00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:42.460
Then they went back to partying.
 

00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:45.680
There was lots of settling of
scores.

00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:48.548
Sometimes not everybody who had
their score settled deserved it.

00:24:48.548 --> 00:24:51.602
There were cases of people who
were misidentified,

00:24:51.602 --> 00:24:55.588
or simply there were rivalries,
but lots of people got theirs.

00:24:55.588 --> 00:24:58.223
As for Marshal Pétain,
what happened to Pétain,

00:24:58.223 --> 00:24:59.190
he was put on trial.
 

00:24:59.190 --> 00:25:02.970
He was an old, old man.
 

00:25:02.970 --> 00:25:04.449
They said, "You can't
execute an old,

00:25:04.449 --> 00:25:04.809
old man.
 

00:25:04.809 --> 00:25:05.930
He's senile."
 

00:25:05.930 --> 00:25:06.880
He wasn't at all.
 

00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:09.804
But you can't execute an old
man who was the hero of Verdun,

00:25:09.804 --> 00:25:10.298
can you?
 

00:25:10.298 --> 00:25:17.528
So, they put him in house
confinement on an island.

00:25:17.528 --> 00:25:20.112
There were still people trying
to get to the island,

00:25:20.112 --> 00:25:22.797
which is off the coast of
Brittany, and bring back his

00:25:22.797 --> 00:25:23.808
bones to Verdun.
 

00:25:23.808 --> 00:25:25.900
That happened only about ten or
twelve years ago.

00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:30.731
So, France--it took a lot
longer than the kind of gunning

00:25:30.731 --> 00:25:36.169
people down and the trials that
went on after the war for France

00:25:36.169 --> 00:25:39.190
to come to grips with his past.
 

00:25:39.190 --> 00:25:41.339
Now, resistance.
 

00:25:54.598 --> 00:25:56.598
What do we know about
resistance?

00:25:56.598 --> 00:25:59.076
First of all,
obviously it was easier to

00:25:59.076 --> 00:26:02.186
resist in the south than the
north, because of the

00:26:02.186 --> 00:26:03.140
topography.
 

00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:07.083
One of the reasons why the
Germans occupied so-called free

00:26:07.083 --> 00:26:11.096
France in November of 1942 was
the fact that resistance had

00:26:11.096 --> 00:26:12.480
already started.
 

00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:15.856
The first active case of
resistance with important

00:26:15.856 --> 00:26:19.233
consequences in Paris was at the
Metro stop called

00:26:19.233 --> 00:26:22.502
Barbès-Rochechouart,
which is now one of those

00:26:22.502 --> 00:26:24.892
places where the police,
especially since Sarkozy was

00:26:24.892 --> 00:26:27.528
elected,
they have these raffles,

00:26:27.528 --> 00:26:31.006
where anyone of color is
immediately asked for their ID

00:26:31.006 --> 00:26:34.740
and made to stand there and be
humiliated by the police.

00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:40.654
Anyway, back then somebody
gunned down a German officer,

00:26:40.654 --> 00:26:45.279
and gradually acts of
resistance started.

00:26:45.279 --> 00:26:48.813
To repeat what I said before,
the word maquis comes

00:26:48.813 --> 00:26:52.586
from a very thick brush that's
in Corsica and in what they call

00:26:52.586 --> 00:26:54.960
in French the garrigue,
also.

00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:56.740
It's a rocky part of the south.
 

00:26:56.740 --> 00:26:58.318
We have it around where we
live, too.

00:26:58.318 --> 00:27:00.952
But it was just sort of a
metaphor for places that you

00:27:00.952 --> 00:27:01.599
could hide.
 

00:27:01.599 --> 00:27:03.490
You had to be out there hiding.
 

00:27:03.490 --> 00:27:06.175
By 1944, by certainly the
spring of 1944,

00:27:06.175 --> 00:27:10.271
and in many places earlier than
that, the maquis ruled,

00:27:10.271 --> 00:27:11.750
at least at night.
 

00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:13.519
During the day they didn't.
 

00:27:13.519 --> 00:27:18.444
Only twice in France did they
foolishly try to take on German

00:27:18.444 --> 00:27:20.990
militarized units,
big units.

00:27:20.990 --> 00:27:25.084
One near Clermont-Ferrand and
the other is near the Vercors,

00:27:25.084 --> 00:27:27.859
which is near Grenoble,
near the Alps.

00:27:27.859 --> 00:27:29.279
They were just wasted.
 

00:27:29.279 --> 00:27:30.509
They were just destroyed.
 

00:27:30.509 --> 00:27:33.987
In a village near us,
somebody denounced people who

00:27:33.987 --> 00:27:37.185
were up in the hills,
up in the Cévennes

00:27:37.185 --> 00:27:38.160
mountains.
 

00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:41.468
One day the motorized units
come, and the parachutes come,

00:27:41.468 --> 00:27:42.630
and they're toast.
 

00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:43.750
That's the end of it.
 

00:27:43.750 --> 00:27:46.006
There were a bunch of
slaughters down around where we

00:27:46.006 --> 00:27:46.308
live.
 

00:27:46.308 --> 00:27:48.529
People don't like to talk about
what happened.

00:27:48.529 --> 00:27:51.165
I wanted to interview somebody
who was a resistor in our

00:27:51.165 --> 00:27:54.138
village, even though our village
isn't where there was a lot of

00:27:54.138 --> 00:27:55.288
resistance going on.
 

00:27:55.288 --> 00:28:00.104
I wanted to talk to him because
I was writing a book about our

00:28:00.104 --> 00:28:02.866
village called
Mémoires de

00:28:02.866 --> 00:28:04.130
pierres.
 

00:28:04.130 --> 00:28:08.082
He agreed to come over and talk
about it, then he simply never

00:28:08.082 --> 00:28:08.858
showed up.
 

00:28:08.858 --> 00:28:11.000
People didn't like to talk
about things like that.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:12.818
He never did want to discuss it.
 

00:28:12.818 --> 00:28:16.980
Obviously, more resistance was
in the south than in the north,

00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:19.500
though it's forgotten often
that there was a lot of

00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:21.673
resistance in Paris,
that there was Jewish

00:28:21.673 --> 00:28:22.930
resistance in Paris,
too.

00:28:22.930 --> 00:28:25.878
I met a guy in Australia eight
years ago who made a lot of

00:28:25.878 --> 00:28:28.413
money making cakes,
and then went back and got his

00:28:28.413 --> 00:28:28.880
Ph.D.
 

00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:31.002
in history working with a
friend of mine,

00:28:31.002 --> 00:28:31.798
Peter McPhee.
 

00:28:31.798 --> 00:28:34.960
He wrote a book on the Jewish
resistance published by Oxford,

00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:38.130
the Jewish resistance in Paris,
a guy called Jacques Adler,

00:28:38.130 --> 00:28:41.338
who is happily still around.
 

00:28:41.338 --> 00:28:45.363
But the most famous cases that
you all know about are these

00:28:45.363 --> 00:28:49.039
resistors who are living off the
land in Auvergne,

00:28:49.039 --> 00:28:54.181
or in the Savenne Mountains,
or anywhere that you could hide

00:28:54.181 --> 00:28:55.390
there would be.
 

00:28:55.390 --> 00:28:59.044
Often in French cities you can
see plaques saying,

00:28:59.044 --> 00:29:03.220
"Resistors met here to
organize resistance."

00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:03.970
That's what they did.
 

00:29:03.970 --> 00:29:05.440
They took big, big chances.
 

00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:08.411
When they, for example,
blew up railroad tracks--there

00:29:08.411 --> 00:29:10.430
were so many communist
resistors,

00:29:10.430 --> 00:29:15.980
and the Communist Party had a
big hold on cheminots,

00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:17.028
the railroad workers.
 

00:29:17.028 --> 00:29:19.359
When you go to railroad
stations, Rouen,

00:29:19.359 --> 00:29:21.990
Lille, anywhere you go you see
huge lists.

00:29:21.990 --> 00:29:24.118
Any railroad station you go to
in France,

00:29:24.118 --> 00:29:26.578
huge lists of people who were
killed during the war,

00:29:26.578 --> 00:29:29.410
either fighting the resistance
or were shot because they were

00:29:29.410 --> 00:29:30.588
involved with sabotage.
 

00:29:30.588 --> 00:29:33.009
It doesn't take much to blow up
a track.

00:29:33.009 --> 00:29:35.482
They did it all the time,
down in the Rhone Valley

00:29:35.482 --> 00:29:36.140
constantly.
 

00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:38.704
There was this woman who was a
big-time collaborator in the

00:29:38.704 --> 00:29:40.430
northern part of the
Ardèche,

00:29:40.430 --> 00:29:43.400
where the awful Xavier Vallat
came from, too.

00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:46.160
He was minister of Jewish
affairs, totally unrepentant.

00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:49.380
That meant that he was shipping
Jews away to be killed.

00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:50.789
That's what he was doing.
 

00:29:50.789 --> 00:29:52.038
She was a collaborator.
 

00:29:52.038 --> 00:29:55.007
One day she walked across the
bridge to go shopping on the

00:29:55.007 --> 00:29:57.868
other side of the Rhone,
and they blew her head away.

00:29:57.868 --> 00:30:01.393
But when you did that,
you knew that they were going

00:30:01.393 --> 00:30:03.190
to pay you back so much.
 

00:30:03.190 --> 00:30:06.008
It's when Heydrich--I went to
see where Heydrich was

00:30:06.008 --> 00:30:07.500
assassinated near Prague.
 

00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:11.068
When Heydrich was assassinated
by Czech resistors in 1942,

00:30:11.068 --> 00:30:13.579
they took an entire village and
killed everybody in the village,

00:30:13.579 --> 00:30:16.480
a place called Lidice,
everybody in the village,

00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:18.308
hundreds and hundreds of people
were massacred.

00:30:18.308 --> 00:30:21.308
They were capable of doing
anything.

00:30:21.308 --> 00:30:24.025
But the point is that in all
these countries there were

00:30:24.025 --> 00:30:26.740
people who were very,
very happy to see that happen.

00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:29.762
If you go to Budapest,
when you see the shoes of all

00:30:29.762 --> 00:30:31.680
the people that were pushed,
shot,

00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:35.558
or just thrown into the
swirling water of the Danube,

00:30:35.558 --> 00:30:38.210
it was Hungarians pushing the
Jews there.

00:30:38.210 --> 00:30:41.588
It was the Hungarians shipping
the Jews off to Auschwitz.

00:30:41.588 --> 00:30:44.529
There were people in every
place who were happy to see

00:30:44.529 --> 00:30:45.750
these things happen.
 

00:30:45.750 --> 00:30:49.079
The big lie in Germany is
people didn't know.

00:30:49.079 --> 00:30:50.059
Of course, people knew.
 

00:30:50.059 --> 00:30:50.910
They knew.
 

00:30:50.910 --> 00:30:52.109
And they knew in France, too.
 

00:30:52.109 --> 00:30:54.670
They knew, absolutely.
 

00:30:54.670 --> 00:30:58.170
It fit into the xenophobia.
 

00:30:58.170 --> 00:31:01.000
It fit into Vichy's vision of
what France would be,

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:04.509
a vision in which the Catholic
Church would have a much greater

00:31:04.509 --> 00:31:05.019
role.
 

00:31:05.019 --> 00:31:08.000
There were two people executed
for abortion during the time,

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.816
a corporatist ethic,
where like Mussolini's

00:31:10.816 --> 00:31:13.163
corporatism,
you'd eliminate class struggle

00:31:13.163 --> 00:31:15.849
by having everybody in vertical
organizations.

00:31:15.849 --> 00:31:19.509
Everybody's happy to be French,
or happy to be Italian,

00:31:19.509 --> 00:31:21.717
or happy to be German,
and you forget the fact that

00:31:21.717 --> 00:31:24.058
your employer makes ten times
more than what you do.

00:31:24.058 --> 00:31:26.946
The kind of embrace of
"peasantism,"

00:31:26.946 --> 00:31:29.000
the resurgence of Joan of Arc.
 

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.896
Joan of Arc became identified
with Pétain,

00:31:31.896 --> 00:31:34.009
as saving France and all of
that.

00:31:34.009 --> 00:31:36.769
It's all very familiar stuff.
 

00:31:36.769 --> 00:31:38.760
They had a plan and the
national revolution was

00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:40.058
something they wanted to do.
 

00:31:40.058 --> 00:31:41.426
My good friend,
Eric Jennings,

00:31:41.426 --> 00:31:43.880
who teaches in Toronto,
wrote a fantastic book called

00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:45.390
Vichy in the Tropics.
 

00:31:45.390 --> 00:31:49.240
He looked at Guadalupe,
Indochina, and Madagascar.

00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:51.041
In those places,
you couldn't say,

00:31:51.041 --> 00:31:54.156
"The Nazis made us do
it," because there weren't

00:31:54.156 --> 00:31:55.250
any Nazis there.
 

00:31:55.250 --> 00:31:56.990
There were no German troops in
those places.

00:31:56.990 --> 00:31:59.940
In Vietnam there were
twenty-seven Jews,

00:31:59.940 --> 00:32:03.284
and they are desperately trying
to find these twenty-seven Jews

00:32:03.284 --> 00:32:05.819
to send them to the death camps
so far away,

00:32:05.819 --> 00:32:07.500
or to kill them themselves.
 

00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:11.789
The shield argument doesn't
work.

00:32:11.789 --> 00:32:13.368
They collaborated.
 

00:32:13.368 --> 00:32:16.079
In the end, a lot of them got
what they wanted.

00:32:16.079 --> 00:32:20.150
As so far as the resistance,
we've always focused on males,

00:32:20.150 --> 00:32:22.542
because the idea is you've got
all these Spanish refugees from

00:32:22.542 --> 00:32:24.779
the civil war,
from Franco and you've got all

00:32:24.779 --> 00:32:27.973
working-class people and you've
got peasants and there are all

00:32:27.973 --> 00:32:28.759
these males.
 

00:32:28.759 --> 00:32:31.464
Yes, they were there,
but somebody had to darn their

00:32:31.464 --> 00:32:31.890
socks.
 

00:32:31.890 --> 00:32:33.410
Somebody had to provide them
with food.

00:32:33.410 --> 00:32:35.048
Somebody had to carry messages.
 

00:32:35.048 --> 00:32:38.500
It's more than just one of
these old movie things of the

00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:42.027
very young,
attractive woman is carrying a

00:32:42.027 --> 00:32:45.315
message,
and charming the guards so they

00:32:45.315 --> 00:32:48.109
don't frisk her or stop her at
all.

00:32:48.109 --> 00:32:49.558
But that happened.
 

00:32:49.558 --> 00:32:52.464
You had to never be so stupid
as to have a written message,

00:32:52.464 --> 00:32:54.470
but you were carrying verbal
messages.

00:32:54.470 --> 00:32:57.375
In places you could hide food,
such as where we live,

00:32:57.375 --> 00:32:58.940
or out near where we live.
 

00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:00.470
Somebody has to take these
people food.

00:33:00.470 --> 00:33:03.828
Also, another thing is the
Catholic Church,

00:33:03.828 --> 00:33:06.938
this business about the pope
helping Jews is just sheer

00:33:06.938 --> 00:33:09.990
nonsense and nobody should ever
be tricked by that.

00:33:09.990 --> 00:33:15.288
But the complicated role of the
Catholic Church in France,

00:33:15.288 --> 00:33:17.288
there was the archbishop of
Toulouse,

00:33:17.288 --> 00:33:19.140
who was a very courageous guy
who said,

00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:22.770
"Don't hurt anybody,"
who was encouraging really

00:33:22.770 --> 00:33:24.298
resistance implicitly.
 

00:33:24.298 --> 00:33:27.098
The archbishop of Albi,
which is only an hour drive if

00:33:27.098 --> 00:33:29.211
that from Toulouse,
he seemed an outright

00:33:29.211 --> 00:33:30.108
collaborator.
 

00:33:30.108 --> 00:33:34.057
In many places,
Catholic clergy who are opinion

00:33:34.057 --> 00:33:38.001
leaders in their village,
along with the schoolteachers,

00:33:38.001 --> 00:33:41.604
were very,
very important in helping give

00:33:41.604 --> 00:33:46.078
a moral kind of stamp to acts of
resistance.

00:33:46.078 --> 00:33:49.696
There's a good book on the
resistance by a guy called

00:33:49.696 --> 00:33:50.880
H.R. Kedward.
 

00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:53.634
He's got two books about the
resistance, one about resistance

00:33:53.634 --> 00:33:55.335
in urban areas,
particularly Lyons and

00:33:55.335 --> 00:33:57.769
Montpellier, and how people kind
of got together.

00:33:57.769 --> 00:33:59.380
You had to be careful about who
you talked to.

00:33:59.380 --> 00:34:02.122
You're waiting for a train,
the train is late because it's

00:34:02.122 --> 00:34:04.480
the war, you're kind of feeling
each other out.

00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:06.992
But you'd better be damn
careful you're not talking to

00:34:06.992 --> 00:34:07.798
some denouncer.
 

00:34:07.798 --> 00:34:11.469
You're toast if you talk to the
wrong person.

00:34:11.469 --> 00:34:14.949
But it's about how you can make
resistance happen.

00:34:14.949 --> 00:34:20.943
It's about, for example,
printing out just little type

00:34:20.943 --> 00:34:26.103
scripted things that say,
"Do not come and hear the

00:34:26.103 --> 00:34:30.159
Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra
when they play in Lyons."

00:34:30.159 --> 00:34:32.318
All you do is you get on a bus
with those things,

00:34:32.318 --> 00:34:34.835
and you're in the back seat,
and the bus turns the corner

00:34:34.835 --> 00:34:36.139
and you just let them go.
 

00:34:36.139 --> 00:34:37.400
The wind takes them.
 

00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:40.472
His other book that's really
good is called In Search of

00:34:40.472 --> 00:34:42.804
the Maquis,
which is about precisely what

00:34:42.804 --> 00:34:43.969
I'm talking about.
 

00:34:43.969 --> 00:34:49.210
It's about the resistance in
the south, and looking at people

00:34:49.210 --> 00:34:50.519
who resisted.
 

00:34:50.519 --> 00:34:51.929
He has an interesting story.
 

00:34:51.929 --> 00:34:55.047
There were a lot of villages
that were Protestant villages

00:34:55.047 --> 00:34:58.110
that suffered greatly during all
the wars of religion.

00:34:58.110 --> 00:35:01.480
A couple were noteworthy in
that after the wars of religion,

00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:04.099
the king had these huge mission
crosses,

00:35:04.099 --> 00:35:07.760
huge crosses of conquest put up
over the village,

00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:09.626
which were essentially
Protestant and remained

00:35:09.626 --> 00:35:10.539
Protestant villages.
 

00:35:10.539 --> 00:35:14.440
Did those signs help identify
the Catholic Church that had

00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:18.204
been the enemy of those
Protestants in the old days with

00:35:18.204 --> 00:35:18.889
Vichy?
 

00:35:18.889 --> 00:35:20.079
Quite possibly.
 

00:35:20.079 --> 00:35:22.998
But it's what John Sweets
called "choices in Vichy

00:35:22.998 --> 00:35:23.809
France."
 

00:35:23.809 --> 00:35:27.239
Things happened that made you
take a choice.

00:35:27.239 --> 00:35:29.190
What was one of those things?
 

00:35:29.190 --> 00:35:32.396
The most important was the STO,
the service du travail

00:35:32.396 --> 00:35:35.230
obligatoire,
which I wrote in the notes,

00:35:35.230 --> 00:35:40.820
the "obligatory work
service."

00:35:40.820 --> 00:35:46.018
The deal was basically that if
you agreed to work in a German

00:35:46.018 --> 00:35:50.349
factory, they would let
prisoners of war go and all

00:35:50.349 --> 00:35:51.130
that.
 

00:35:51.130 --> 00:35:52.119
It doesn't work out like that.
 

00:35:52.119 --> 00:35:53.010
These people were fools.
 

00:35:53.010 --> 00:35:54.260
Two people from our village
went.

00:35:54.260 --> 00:35:55.179
One was dead drunk.
 

00:35:55.179 --> 00:35:57.059
Someone told him he was going
to a party.

00:35:57.059 --> 00:35:58.010
So, he got on the bus.
 

00:35:58.010 --> 00:35:59.909
The next stop is the Rhineland.
 

00:35:59.909 --> 00:36:03.119
Of course, those people are
wasted by the bombing,

00:36:03.119 --> 00:36:06.855
because the Allies are the
masters of the air for the last

00:36:06.855 --> 00:36:08.690
couple years of the war.
 

00:36:08.690 --> 00:36:10.900
They systematically devastate
those factories.

00:36:10.900 --> 00:36:16.855
A lot of those people in the
STO that went were killed,

00:36:16.855 --> 00:36:18.730
left the earth.
 

00:36:18.730 --> 00:36:22.289
What the STO did is it made
people take a choice.

00:36:22.289 --> 00:36:26.715
If you didn't show up on the
9^(th) of February,

00:36:26.715 --> 00:36:30.860
or you pick the date,
1944, you didn't go.

00:36:30.860 --> 00:36:33.382
If you're sitting in your
village, they're going to come

00:36:33.382 --> 00:36:34.070
and take you.
 

00:36:34.070 --> 00:36:37.664
At that point--choices in
Vichy, France--;"I'm going

00:36:37.664 --> 00:36:40.489
to go in the resistance,"
big choice.

00:36:40.489 --> 00:36:42.000
You go in the resistance.
 

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:43.610
You live off the land.
 

00:36:43.610 --> 00:36:47.293
Sometimes just a couple people,
sometimes lots of people,

00:36:47.293 --> 00:36:48.610
international mix.
 

00:36:48.610 --> 00:36:50.797
Lots of Poles were there,
lots of Spaniards,

00:36:50.797 --> 00:36:52.679
but most of the people were
French.

00:36:52.679 --> 00:36:55.780
One of the interesting things
is that the resistance itself

00:36:55.780 --> 00:36:59.009
did not,
unlike almost every big

00:36:59.009 --> 00:37:05.550
political event in France since
the Revolution to 1981,

00:37:05.550 --> 00:37:09.469
did not follow traditional
lines between right and left.

00:37:09.469 --> 00:37:13.630
Leftwing regions did not have a
monopoly on the resistance.

00:37:13.630 --> 00:37:16.199
There was tons of resistance in
Brittany.

00:37:16.199 --> 00:37:19.030
There was tons of resistance in
Normandy.

00:37:19.030 --> 00:37:21.956
Eisenhower after the war said
the French resistance was worth

00:37:21.956 --> 00:37:23.710
an entire division,
or two divisions,

00:37:23.710 --> 00:37:25.760
I can't remember exactly what
he said.

00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:29.233
Of course, they helped prepare
the way in Normandy for the

00:37:29.233 --> 00:37:30.820
invasion of June 6,1944.
 

00:37:30.820 --> 00:37:34.844
That old left-right dichotomy
does not work in terms of

00:37:34.844 --> 00:37:35.590
regions.
 

00:37:35.590 --> 00:37:39.275
It does work in terms of what
people were more likely to

00:37:39.275 --> 00:37:39.880
resist.
 

00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:42.840
Working people were more likely
to resist,

00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:48.159
because their unions had been
broken by Vichy,

00:37:48.159 --> 00:37:51.057
because they were more apt to
have supported the Popular

00:37:51.057 --> 00:37:51.480
Front.
 

00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:55.001
"No to the France of the
aperitif"

00:37:55.001 --> 00:37:57.869
was the cry of the right in
1936.

00:37:57.869 --> 00:38:00.481
"No to the France of
drinking before lunch,"

00:38:00.481 --> 00:38:01.369
and all of this.
 

00:38:01.369 --> 00:38:03.699
"No to the France of the
Jew Blum."

00:38:03.699 --> 00:38:07.409
"Better Hitler than
Blum" over and over again.

00:38:07.409 --> 00:38:11.579
Working people and peasants,
like the ones who said,

00:38:11.579 --> 00:38:13.775
"Nous sommes rouge,
comme le vin,"

00:38:13.775 --> 00:38:16.719
that I mentioned before,
are more apt to resist.

00:38:16.719 --> 00:38:20.047
Now, why does the Communist
Party have such a privileged

00:38:20.047 --> 00:38:21.559
role in the resistance?
 

00:38:21.559 --> 00:38:24.771
After the war,
they called themselves the

00:38:24.771 --> 00:38:26.860
party of 75,000 martyrs.
 

00:38:26.860 --> 00:38:30.210
That may be an exaggeration,
but not by much.

00:38:30.210 --> 00:38:34.143
Whenever there was a shooting,
whenever there was a Nazi

00:38:34.143 --> 00:38:36.726
gunned down,
whenever there was a railroad

00:38:36.726 --> 00:38:38.809
track blown up,
carrying munitions,

00:38:38.809 --> 00:38:41.150
carrying soldiers,
carrying whatever,

00:38:41.150 --> 00:38:42.150
whenever they couldn't get
through,

00:38:42.150 --> 00:38:43.619
who were the ones who are
first,

00:38:43.619 --> 00:38:45.920
when they go to the mayor and
say,

00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:47.030
"Who do you want
shot?"

00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:49.239
The communists would be the
first to go, always.

00:38:49.239 --> 00:38:51.675
The forts around Paris and
these other places,

00:38:51.675 --> 00:38:54.980
there were communists put up
against the wall all the time.

00:38:54.980 --> 00:38:58.407
They were the most likely to
resist, along with other

00:38:58.407 --> 00:38:59.199
Gaullists.
 

00:38:59.199 --> 00:39:01.920
Jean Moulin,
the prefect of the Eure-et-Loir

00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:05.719
who was hideously tortured
without revealing any secrets,

00:39:05.719 --> 00:39:10.010
was one who was sent out to try
to unify the resistance.

00:39:10.010 --> 00:39:11.880
Why were the communists so
effective?

00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:15.429
Because the Communist Party are
organized into cells.

00:39:15.429 --> 00:39:19.494
We still get little notices in
our mailbox saying that the

00:39:19.494 --> 00:39:22.257
Communist Party,
the cell of Balazuc where we

00:39:22.257 --> 00:39:23.885
live,
all four people in the

00:39:23.885 --> 00:39:27.014
Communist Party are going to
meet together and to drink

00:39:27.014 --> 00:39:29.840
illegal wine,
to drink a wine called Clinton.

00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:32.880
I was once asked to describe
the fall of capitalism.

00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:35.112
I had to say,
"It's really not falling

00:39:35.112 --> 00:39:35.750
yet."
 

00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:40.309
The point is that they were
already organized.

00:39:40.309 --> 00:39:44.139
These networks were not
destroyed by the war,

00:39:44.139 --> 00:39:46.489
were not destroyed by it.
 

00:39:46.489 --> 00:39:48.449
They existed, the comradeship.
 

00:39:48.449 --> 00:39:51.096
If you were a communist,
you'd been a communist since

00:39:51.096 --> 00:39:53.030
the 1930s, you trusted those
people.

00:39:53.030 --> 00:39:55.489
You were apt to fall in with
them.

00:39:55.489 --> 00:39:57.750
There were two people,
one of whom is still alive.

00:39:57.750 --> 00:40:00.603
He spent a lot of time in
prison in Paris,

00:40:00.603 --> 00:40:01.440
a painter.
 

00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:02.670
He's now ninety-five.
 

00:40:02.670 --> 00:40:03.690
He's a friend of mine.
 

00:40:03.690 --> 00:40:06.139
He and his wife,
the first vacations,

00:40:06.139 --> 00:40:07.909
they took a double bike.
 

00:40:07.909 --> 00:40:11.034
They pedaled all the way from
Paris down to our village,

00:40:11.034 --> 00:40:13.650
which they had subsequently
made their home.

00:40:13.650 --> 00:40:16.889
They joined the Communist Party
in 1933 and 1935.

00:40:16.889 --> 00:40:19.840
He was a big time resistor.
 

00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:22.000
He was damn lucky to escape
with his life.

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.159
He was scheduled to be executed
and he wasn't.

00:40:24.159 --> 00:40:26.389
He painted people in the prison.
 

00:40:26.389 --> 00:40:27.900
I've seen his paintings.
 

00:40:27.900 --> 00:40:31.800
The socialists weren't
organized in that way.

00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:33.215
Sometimes after the war the
communists said,

00:40:33.215 --> 00:40:33.610
"Aha!
 

00:40:33.610 --> 00:40:36.559
The socialists weren't the big
resistors."

00:40:36.559 --> 00:40:37.989
Well, many did, individually.
 

00:40:37.989 --> 00:40:40.179
Léon Blum was lucky not
to have been executed.

00:40:40.179 --> 00:40:43.710
He survived the war in prison.
 

00:40:43.710 --> 00:40:46.219
He was put on trial at a place
called Riom, right near

00:40:46.219 --> 00:40:47.119
Clermont-Ferrand.
 

00:40:47.119 --> 00:40:48.539
He survives the war.
 

00:40:48.539 --> 00:40:50.300
But there was a Catholic
resistance.

00:40:50.300 --> 00:40:53.949
I have very old friends,
much older than me,

00:40:53.949 --> 00:40:57.987
who went from the leftwing
Catholic resistance into the

00:40:57.987 --> 00:41:01.280
Communist Party,
into the Socialist Party,

00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:04.590
kind of the normal trajectory
of those things among militants.

00:41:04.590 --> 00:41:08.969
They were resistors also.
 

00:41:08.969 --> 00:41:13.782
Protestants are more known for
having resisted because of some

00:41:13.782 --> 00:41:15.440
very famous events.
 

00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:17.447
But remember,
only five percent of the French

00:41:17.447 --> 00:41:18.679
population is Protestant.
 

00:41:18.679 --> 00:41:20.949
There's a village called Le
Chambon-sur-Lignon,

00:41:20.949 --> 00:41:23.320
which in Haute-Loire,
but near Ardèche.

00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:27.166
They had a cottage industry of
making fake IDs for Jewish

00:41:27.166 --> 00:41:30.737
children from Lyons and
Saint-Étienne who were

00:41:30.737 --> 00:41:34.239
kept in this small village and
who were saved,

00:41:34.239 --> 00:41:36.550
who were saved because of these
people.

00:41:36.550 --> 00:41:38.309
Whenever the Germans would come
through,

00:41:38.309 --> 00:41:40.840
which wasn't that often,
they would hide the children,

00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:43.500
or the Germans would go through
and say, "My god,

00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:44.268
there are a lot of children.
 

00:41:44.268 --> 00:41:45.750
Well, these are practicing
Catholics, aren't they?"

00:41:45.750 --> 00:41:46.530
They weren't.
 

00:41:46.530 --> 00:41:48.889
They were practicing
Protestants.

00:41:48.889 --> 00:41:54.889
Those are the more famous
cases, but lots of people

00:41:54.889 --> 00:41:56.210
resisted.
 

00:41:56.210 --> 00:41:58.764
Lots of people resisted,
but lots of people

00:41:58.764 --> 00:42:01.135
collaborated,
and many other people were

00:42:01.135 --> 00:42:02.110
indifferent.
 

00:42:02.110 --> 00:42:03.050
That's the way it is.
 

00:42:03.050 --> 00:42:05.210
I want to close with a story of
Oradour-sur-Glane,

00:42:05.210 --> 00:42:08.244
because somebody who wrote this
book called Martyred

00:42:08.244 --> 00:42:11.280
Village, both in French,
chez Gallimard,

00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:14.798
and in English with Cal Press,
was somebody who took this

00:42:14.798 --> 00:42:18.632
course with me a long time ago,
and was in Ezra Stiles College,

00:42:18.632 --> 00:42:19.510
Sarah Farmer.
 

00:42:19.510 --> 00:42:25.070
There was a village near
Limoges where,

00:42:25.070 --> 00:42:29.039
when the Germans were leaving,
they were leaving,

00:42:29.039 --> 00:42:32.271
getting the hell out,
going north after this massacre

00:42:32.271 --> 00:42:34.369
in Tulles that I alluded to.
 

00:42:34.369 --> 00:42:37.795
Suddenly they show up in the
village and they shoot all the

00:42:37.795 --> 00:42:39.012
men,
and they put the men,

00:42:39.012 --> 00:42:40.199
and the women,
and the children,

00:42:40.199 --> 00:42:41.500
in a church and they kill them.
 

00:42:41.500 --> 00:42:42.869
They blow the church up.
 

00:42:42.869 --> 00:42:44.619
One woman escaped through the
little window.

00:42:44.619 --> 00:42:47.474
A very thin lady escaped
through the little window behind

00:42:47.474 --> 00:42:47.730
it.
 

00:42:47.730 --> 00:42:50.150
They destroyed the entire
village.

00:42:50.150 --> 00:42:52.603
People who had taken the tram
to the market in Limoges came

00:42:52.603 --> 00:42:53.829
back and there was nothing.
 

00:42:53.829 --> 00:42:57.329
Everybody was dead, dead.
 

00:42:57.329 --> 00:43:01.018
They left this village standing
the way it always--it's still

00:43:01.018 --> 00:43:01.510
there.
 

00:43:01.510 --> 00:43:03.010
Now there's a center of memory.
 

00:43:03.010 --> 00:43:04.909
One of my friends is the
director of it.

00:43:04.909 --> 00:43:06.460
Sarah Farmer wrote a book about
it.

00:43:06.460 --> 00:43:11.398
But what's important about it
is that this was the site

00:43:11.398 --> 00:43:15.880
chosen, the site chosen to
commemorate the war.

00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:16.141
Why?
 

00:43:16.141 --> 00:43:19.425
Because it was virgin,
no collaborators supposedly,

00:43:19.425 --> 00:43:21.199
no resistors supposedly.
 

00:43:21.199 --> 00:43:22.920
Martyred Village.
 

00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:26.320
It turned out more complicated
than that.

00:43:26.320 --> 00:43:28.068
It's a wonderful book,
Martyred Village,

00:43:28.068 --> 00:43:28.639
Sarah Farmer.
 

00:43:28.639 --> 00:43:32.329
But what shows the complexity
of it is what happened

00:43:32.329 --> 00:43:33.268
afterwards.
 

00:43:33.268 --> 00:43:36.099
The people in this village were
gunned down.

00:43:36.099 --> 00:43:41.152
The women and children were
killed by some Germans,

00:43:41.152 --> 00:43:47.318
but lots of them were Alsatian,
who were brought directly into

00:43:47.318 --> 00:43:49.340
the German army.
 

00:43:49.340 --> 00:43:52.210
So, they went on trial in 1953.
 

00:43:52.210 --> 00:43:54.427
There were riots in Colmar,
in Strasbourg,

00:43:54.427 --> 00:43:56.590
that they should ever be put on
trial.

00:43:56.590 --> 00:43:58.565
They called themselves the
malgré

00:43:58.565 --> 00:44:00.920
nous, the "in spite of
ourselves."

00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:06.429
There were riots in Limoges
that the penalties were so mild.

00:44:06.429 --> 00:44:11.409
Some of them were let go if
they had not joined voluntarily.

00:44:11.409 --> 00:44:13.449
The others went to jail.
 

00:44:13.449 --> 00:44:16.869
The man who apparently ordered
the massacre,

00:44:16.869 --> 00:44:19.353
a guy called Franz Lammerding,
they were various attempts to

00:44:19.353 --> 00:44:21.980
kidnap him from Germany and
bring him back to France,

00:44:21.980 --> 00:44:25.820
but he died a natural death in
the 1970s or 1980s.

00:44:25.820 --> 00:44:30.373
This was the enormous,
ironic complexity of the whole

00:44:30.373 --> 00:44:33.222
thing,
of getting into the history of

00:44:33.222 --> 00:44:34.851
history,
of trying to understand what

00:44:34.851 --> 00:44:39.302
happened during those years,
that some of the murderers in

00:44:39.302 --> 00:44:43.840
this case were Alsatian,
and therefore French,

00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:48.590
until Hitler invades in 1940.
 

00:44:48.590 --> 00:44:51.880
So, collaboration and
resistance.

00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:55.331
Great subjects for study,
but heartbreaking,

00:44:55.331 --> 00:44:57.340
just absolutely tragic.
 

00:44:57.340 --> 00:45:04.230
The Nazis would be happy to do
all of the stuff on their own,

00:45:04.230 --> 00:45:07.735
but the xenophobia,
the anti-Semitism led to those

00:45:07.735 --> 00:45:11.389
cases of the guys going up the
stairs in Paris,

00:45:11.389 --> 00:45:14.228
and in other cities,
and all the patrons

00:45:14.228 --> 00:45:16.530
signing lives away were French.
 

00:45:16.530 --> 00:45:20.317
So, France, as in other
countries, it's happening in

00:45:20.317 --> 00:45:23.510
Belgium, too,
are coming to grips with their

00:45:23.510 --> 00:45:24.179
past.
 

00:45:24.179 --> 00:45:27.312
So, it's been a sad pleasure to
talk about that.

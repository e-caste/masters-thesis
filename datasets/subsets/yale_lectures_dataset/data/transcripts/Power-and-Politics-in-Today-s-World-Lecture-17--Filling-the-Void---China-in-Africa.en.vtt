00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.323
- Good morning everybody.

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.120
So most of you know
that Christina Seyfried

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.710
is the head teaching fellow in the course.

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:19.230
But what you don't know about her

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.150
is that she's writing a dissertation,

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.820
she's an advanced graduate
student in political science

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.410
writing a dissertation
about China in Africa.

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.480
And has spent much of the
last two years in Nigeria,

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.230
Ethiopia, South Africa and elsewhere

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.580
studying just what the
Chinese are doing there.

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.450
She is also the brains and energy

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.940
behind Yale's China-Africa initiative

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.060
that has been going on for
the last several years.

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.140
So it seemed absurd for me
to be giving this lecture

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.480
when there's somebody who knows

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.390
in such more intricate detail

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.320
about what's going on then Christina so,

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.260
Christina, welcome.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:00.978
The floor is yours.

00:01:00.978 --> 00:01:03.978
(audience clapping)

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:07.920
- Great, thank you so much, professor.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.260
Welcome, everyone.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.450
I just wanna say I feel extremely honored

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.490
to be giving this lecture
today on China in Africa,

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.630
especially because my journey
really with this topic

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.220
started three years ago.

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:20.800
In my first semester here at Yale

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.810
when I took a class with Professor Shapiro

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:23.930
at the business school,

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.880
and one of the lectures
was on China in Africa.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.620
And I found the topic
extremely interesting.

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.690
And I started to read more about it.

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.580
But I was a little bit
not completely satisfied

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.020
with the rather China centric angle

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.460
that literature was taking on the topic.

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.240
So I decided to write my dissertation

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.520
on how African governments strategize

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.350
around Chinese investments
in their countries.

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.600
And I spent 10 months
of doing field research

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.960
now in the African region.

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:50.793
And as I said,

00:01:50.793 --> 00:01:52.860
I feel extremely honored now to be back

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.430
and to be standing on the other
side now of the classroom,

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.820
and to teach a lecture
on China-Africa myself

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.310
and to share some of the
lessons from my research

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:01.910
with you today.

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:03.380
So to start us off,

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.360
I brought you a video from the forum

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.450
on China-Africa cooperation,

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.670
that just happened in
September of last year.

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.130
And China started these forums in 2000.

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.430
And they have been
happening every three years.

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.460
And China uses them as a platform

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.890
in order to announce
a strategy for Africa.

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.390
So in terms of loans, trade and investment

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.233
for the next three year period.

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.130
- [Woman] Building a
community with a shared future

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.490
and seeking inclusive growth,

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:32.760
the opening ceremony of this year's summit

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.570
for the forum on China-Africa cooperation,

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:38.580
saw President Xi Jinping
outline his vision

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.053
for China's ties with the
African continent in the new era.

00:02:43.053 --> 00:02:46.280
(speaking foreign language)

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.290
- [Translator] China is the
largest developing country

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.150
in the world, and Africa is home

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.780
to the largest number
of developing countries.

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.170
China and Africa have
already formed a community

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:56.600
with a shared future.

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.970
We stand united with Africa's
people thinking with one mind

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.080
and working with one heart.

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.850
- [Woman] President Xi
Jinping has announced

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.033
eight major initiatives
in the coming three years.

00:03:08.378 --> 00:03:11.620
(speaking foreign language)

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:12.460
- [Translator] The framework of the

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:14.270
10 major cooperation plans,

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:16.900
China will work closely
with African countries

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.370
and implement eight major initiatives

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:21.500
in the next three years and beyond.

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.550
It feels like industrial acceleration,

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.630
infrastructure connectivity,
trade facilitation,

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:30.210
green development, capacity
building, healthcare,

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:33.243
people to people exchanges,
and peace and security.

00:03:34.794 --> 00:03:37.730
(speaking foreign language)

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:40.100
In order to promote the
successful implementation

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.100
of the eight major initiatives,

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.020
China will provide $60
billion in support for Africa.

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:49.600
For government assistance,
financial institutions,

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.250
and financing from Chinese enterprises.

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.650
It will include $15 billion in free aid,

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.507
interest free loans,
and concessional loans.

00:03:58.507 --> 00:04:01.377
$20 billion in credit funds,

00:04:01.377 --> 00:04:05.097
$10 billion in China-Africa
developmental financing,

00:04:05.097 --> 00:04:10.090
$5 billion in special funds
for import trade from Africa,

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:12.760
no less than $10 billion in investment

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.350
from Chinese companies
over the next three years.

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:18.100
- [Woman] Already the summit has passed

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:19.750
two outcome documents,

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:21.740
including the Beijing declaration

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:25.960
and the FOCAC action plan 2019 to 2021.

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.630
Participants say that in a
current era of globalization,

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:32.290
all nations have a common destiny.

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:34.680
And to put it in the
words of President Xi,

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.870
everyone has in himself,
a little bit of others.

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:40.350
- So as you can see,

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:42.940
a lot of big announcements
were made at this forum.

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.440
And this last image here has
actually become very famous

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.450
because for the first time in
the history of these forums,

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:53.430
53 out of 54 African
countries were represented.

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.400
And I remember an African
newspaper called Africa News

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.410
wrote at the time that this was the week

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:01.390
where the African continent
was bereft of its leaders

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:04.410
because everyone was
hanging out in Beijing.

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:06.410
So this is just really
the most recent peak

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:09.440
of China-Africa relations
that have gained more and more

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.610
international attention from
practitioners and academics

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:15.290
over really the past 10 years or so.

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:18.160
But why is it that this
has become such a hot topic

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.820
from a developmental point of view I mean?

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:22.580
And in order to answer this question,

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:25.230
I would like us to take a
step back and think about

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:28.330
what are the African regions
persistent growth obstacles?

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:32.810
And I brought you a comparison
here from 1982 to 2016.

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:34.710
And you see in the 1980s,

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:37.790
China really was poor agricultural,

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:40.640
and had just emerged out of
a series of intense conflict,

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:42.680
namely the Cultural Revolution.

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:45.150
And you see that China was in fact poorer

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:46.510
than most African countries,

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:48.960
except for Guinea Bissau and Uganda.

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.400
But fast forward to 2016,

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.720
China is now richer than
most African countries

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.400
except for Equatorial
Guinea and the Seychelles.

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.400
And I know in lecture four we
studied very much in detail

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.090
China's growth miracle.

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:03.840
But what was meanwhile
happening in the African region.

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:08.010
So after decolonization,

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:10.263
several African leaders
starting in Nigeria,

00:06:10.263 --> 00:06:12.270
Zambia and Tanzania,

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:14.980
tried to import substitution
industrialization.

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:17.500
And that means you
basically keep your economy

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:18.703
closed to international trade

00:06:18.703 --> 00:06:22.310
and you try to grow and
develop local industries first

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:25.110
that compete within the domestic market.

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:27.680
But that is an economic
growth recipe really failed.

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:31.150
So after several debts and oil crisis,

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:34.340
the IMF and the World
Bank stepped into Africa

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:37.760
and implemented so called
structural adjustment programs.

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:39.690
And the idea was that

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:42.210
everything needed to
solve Africa's poverty

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:45.170
was real neoliberalism through
the Washington Consensus.

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:48.800
So deregulation, privatization,
and liberalization.

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.480
And after that, everything
would fall into place.

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:52.800
But that logic was flawed.

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:54.680
And even after these
countries went through

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:56.270
structural adjustment programs,

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:57.990
foreign investors weren't really willing

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:00.200
to come to Africa still.

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:01.830
So at the turn of the millennial,

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:05.160
Jeffrey Sachs who was a very
famous economist at Columbia.

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.590
He also worked on the
Millennium Development Goals

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:08.520
with the UN.

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:10.960
He wrote this famous piece on Africa

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:13.190
being caught in a poverty trap.

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:15.720
And what he's saying is
that because of diseases,

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:18.440
low stocks of human capital, technology,

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:20.080
high transportation costs

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:22.730
and an adverse geopolitical location,

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:26.190
Africa is really stuck
with both weak growth

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:27.950
and weak institutions.

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:31.370
And we have studied the
modernization theory that says that

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:34.180
growth supposedly leads
to strong institutions.

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:36.270
But the question here
is what leads to growth

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:37.360
in the first place.

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:39.630
And he's saying that foreign investors

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:41.810
don't want to come to the African region,

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:44.060
because they aren't strong institutions

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:45.800
that could enforce property rights,

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:46.847
the rule of law, et cetera.

00:07:46.847 --> 00:07:49.330
And he's really advocating for aid

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:51.350
as the solution to Africa.

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:56.350
And there are economists
such as William Easterly

00:07:56.570 --> 00:08:00.690
or Dambisa Moyo who highly
criticize this call for aid

00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:02.620
as a solution for poverty.

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:04.690
But it remained the fact
that the African region

00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:07.080
wasn't able to attract much investment.

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:11.730
And then, with the wake of
the financial crisis in 2008,

00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:13.330
it looked even more dire

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:16.510
because you have the collapse
of the Washington Consensus.

00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:20.410
And if this hit to this
overconfidence and neoliberalism

00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:23.820
as a concept and then the
solution to end poverty,

00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:25.430
and you really see a retraction

00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:27.840
of Western investment in Africa,

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:30.850
also because the West is
running capital shortages,

00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:33.520
as they have to bail out banks at home.

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:34.770
So now the question is,

00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:38.840
where can Africa attract
investment from now?

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:40.750
But as Deborah Brautigam in her book

00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:43.150
that you were also supposed to
read for this lecture today,

00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:45.570
predicted, China meanwhile is rising

00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:48.380
and is running huge capital surpluses.

00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:51.010
So where others are exiting as
the path of least resistance

00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:53.530
going back to Hirschman,
who we have studied as well.

00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:56.250
China now fills the void
that the West is leaving

00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:58.886
and increases its presence in Africa.

00:08:58.886 --> 00:09:02.790
Hence we know that China has
lifted millions of people

00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:03.830
out of poverty.

00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:05.817
And I would really
recommend this book by Ang

00:09:05.817 --> 00:09:08.140
"How China Escaped the Poverty Trap".

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:11.500
So now the question is, is
China just a new colonialist?

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:14.470
Or is its presence going
to add something beneficial

00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:16.410
to the African continent?

00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:17.950
And as I walk you through the slides,

00:09:17.950 --> 00:09:20.360
I would like you to think
about this question,

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:22.530
whether it is even the
right question to ask

00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:26.790
and I'll also offer you my
opinion, as we move along.

00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:28.550
So for today's agenda,

00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:31.400
I will provide you with
a quick historic overview

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:33.400
on China-Africa relations,

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:35.800
then I'll give you a big picture

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:38.480
of what China is doing in Africa today.

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:40.540
And then we'll dive
into some key questions

00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:43.330
that I think are important to
ask about this relationship.

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:46.030
And I will use two case
studies, Nigeria and Ethiopia,

00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:47.550
which are among the top receivers

00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:49.603
of Chinese assistance in Africa.

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:52.660
And then I'll talk about some
lessons and I wanna bring up

00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:55.580
this idea of African bargaining power here

00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:58.980
and how much African agency
matters in this relationship.

00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:01.060
And then finally I'll
give you my two cents

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:03.380
on where I think this
relationship with China

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:04.573
is going in the future.

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:09.090
So a lot of people think that
China really started to become

00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:11.640
present in Africa in the early 2000s.

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:15.080
When in fact, we have to go
back to the end of World War II.

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:17.840
And African countries are
slowly becoming independent,

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:21.660
while China is meanwhile fighting
its own domestic conflict,

00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:23.460
where the communists had just driven out

00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:25.430
the nationalists to Taiwan.

00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:28.150
And Beijing, China is
now looking for allies

00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:30.260
in this Beijing-Taiwan conflict.

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.880
And after independence,
14 African countries

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:35.540
actually decided to
side with Beijing here.

00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:38.920
And we have very skillful leaders
like Sekou Toure in Guinea

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:41.400
who played the United
States and the Soviet Union

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:43.810
against each other in their aid offers.

00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:47.580
And then he secretly accepted
$25 million from China

00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:48.623
on the backside.

00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:52.130
China at that time is
also rewarding socialists

00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:54.060
and communist movements as in Guinea

00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:58.140
but also in Ghana and Mali but
after the Sino-Soviet split,

00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:00.430
which was basically about
personal differences

00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:02.560
between Mao Zedong and Nikita Khrushchev,

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:06.300
but also different
ideological interpretation

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:09.240
of Marx Leninism.

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:11.450
Sorry, Marxism-Leninism.

00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:15.720
China has an interest in keeping
up this non aligned world

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:19.470
that neither sides with the
US or the Soviet Union here.

00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:22.480
And what's really
interesting is that in 1971,

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:25.940
Beijing, China is actually
able to gain back a seat

00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:28.880
at the UN that had been
previously occupied by Taiwan.

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:30.950
And Tanzania was very, very vocal

00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:33.640
here in these negotiations.

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:35.830
So we studied how in 1978,

00:11:35.830 --> 00:11:38.780
China opened up its borders to the world.

00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:41.340
And it officially starts
its bringing in period

00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:42.560
where it is trying to attract

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:45.650
as much foreign capital as possible.

00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:49.020
And what's really striking
here is that China

00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:51.120
is the only developing
country in the world

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:54.660
that is also offering aid to
other developing countries.

00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:56.760
And the strategy here is very much based

00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:58.890
on its own experience as an aid recipient

00:11:58.890 --> 00:12:00.520
for example from Japan.

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:03.630
That during that time knocked
on China stores and said,

00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:05.560
we'll offer you low interest,

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:10.560
low interest loans for
technology and material

00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:12.920
and in exchange for crude oil.

00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:15.760
And we see very similar
deals still being made today

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:17.543
between China and Africa.

00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:23.170
And we studied how China
was able to rise very fast.

00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:25.110
So starting in the early 1990s,

00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:27.240
China's running huge capital surpluses

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:30.060
and is officially entering
this going out period,

00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:31.600
that we're still in today.

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:34.900
And China is trying to
put its capital abroad,

00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:36.040
to invest it abroad,

00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:39.120
and it really uses its
aid as a strategic tool

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:41.040
to promote Chinese exports,

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:44.210
and to help Chinese infant
companies really grow and learn

00:12:44.210 --> 00:12:45.970
in other countries.

00:12:45.970 --> 00:12:48.480
And it also positions itself

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:51.530
sort of as an alternative to Western aid.

00:12:51.530 --> 00:12:55.290
So in 2005 in Tanzania President Mkapa,

00:12:55.290 --> 00:12:56.950
he really when he stepped down,

00:12:56.950 --> 00:12:59.370
wanted to give his population kind of

00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:01.820
as a departure gift, a football stadium.

00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:03.720
But the problem was that Tanzania

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:06.260
was on the list of highly
indebted poor nations.

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.570
And they were supposed to
actually run austerity measures,

00:13:08.570 --> 00:13:10.410
and couldn't spend all that money.

00:13:10.410 --> 00:13:12.610
But then he went to China and China said,

00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:15.090
okay, we're willing to build
you that football stadium.

00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:18.830
It's gonna be smaller, but
we're still gonna build you one.

00:13:18.830 --> 00:13:20.210
So he was happy.

00:13:20.210 --> 00:13:24.020
But what's very interesting
is that in the early 2000s,

00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:28.587
China seems to have accepted
the rules of neoliberalism.

00:13:28.587 --> 00:13:32.450
And the US is an economic
headroom at that time,

00:13:32.450 --> 00:13:36.480
because it joins the WTO at
a lot of pressure from the US

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:38.560
and it seems like it wants to play

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:41.090
by the capitalist international rules

00:13:41.090 --> 00:13:43.090
that were set up by the US.

00:13:43.090 --> 00:13:46.587
But then as we studied the
financial crisis hits in 2008,

00:13:46.587 --> 00:13:48.970
and this is also a hit
to this overconfidence

00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:52.090
that neoliberalism is
sort of the way to go.

00:13:52.090 --> 00:13:56.570
And it gets a lot of affirmation
to the Beijing, China model

00:13:56.570 --> 00:13:58.910
which is the state capitalism

00:13:58.910 --> 00:14:03.480
and that it sometimes it's
better if the government

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:06.910
owns companies in a certain
sector that is deemed strategic.

00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:08.870
And if you have large
infrastructure investments

00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:10.970
and that sort of an
interventionist approach

00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:13.200
by the government is more effective

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:16.500
than leaving everything
to the private market.

00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:19.030
And an embodiment of this new confidence

00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:20.020
that China has found

00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:22.200
is the Asian Infrastructure
Investment Bank,

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:23.910
and the Belt and Road Initiative

00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:25.890
that I'll talk about in a little bit.

00:14:25.890 --> 00:14:29.130
But I would really recommend
this book by Kurlantzick here,

00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:32.110
where he also talks about the
effect of state capitalism

00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:34.590
and the spread of it in
today's world on democracy

00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:36.030
if you're interested.

00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:38.330
And as I said, the most recent peak

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:40.910
of China-Africa relations
has really been this

00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:44.020
FOCAC meeting of 2018
where you saw the clip,

00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:47.890
where really China is trying
to rebrand this relationship

00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:51.120
with Africa and it has signal
that it's been listening

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:53.700
to the concerns about
debt traps, et cetera.

00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:56.560
So it seems like the
relationship has matured

00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:59.420
or that's at least the narrative about it.

00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:01.920
So what is China doing an Africa today

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:05.110
and I'll briefly walk you
through loans and trade,

00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:09.170
which are oftentimes in the news.

00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:11.330
But then I also wanna
talk about investments,

00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:12.650
which is what I'm focusing on

00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:14.760
and it's a smaller sector
of Chinese involvement,

00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:16.100
but growing.

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:18.020
And then I'll also talk very briefly

00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:20.633
about China's military presence in Africa.

00:15:21.810 --> 00:15:24.670
So China's loan strategy in Africa

00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:27.240
is very much based on this
idea of state capitalism,

00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:30.290
that you need to take a lot of
money into your hands first,

00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:33.000
and invest in infrastructure and sort of

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.310
get in the early stages of development,

00:15:35.310 --> 00:15:38.700
kind of the state to make growth happen.

00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:40.420
And as we know,

00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:43.300
African countries sometimes
have shortages of money.

00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:47.610
So these loans serve that they
lend to these countries now

00:15:47.610 --> 00:15:49.130
so that they can build infrastructure

00:15:49.130 --> 00:15:51.340
which is pre-stage of industrialization,

00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:53.940
in order to make growth
and development happen.

00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:56.160
And just to give you an idea

00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:59.710
of how big these loans are today,

00:15:59.710 --> 00:16:01.310
we see that really,

00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:03.090
the loans from the China Exim Bank

00:16:03.090 --> 00:16:06.140
are already competing
with World Bank loans.

00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:10.610
So the same magnitude that
we're talking about today.

00:16:10.610 --> 00:16:12.620
But there's a big difference between

00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:14.240
World Bank and Chinese loans,

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:17.140
namely that World Bank loans
come with strings attached.

00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:21.110
So this is based on the structural
adjustment programs today

00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:22.760
so we have austerity measures,

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:25.090
and if you're expected
to have fiscal prudence,

00:16:25.090 --> 00:16:27.670
where Chinese loans really
have no strings attached.

00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:30.110
And a lot of people are
concerned about this

00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:32.930
because if this money gets
into the hands of politicians,

00:16:32.930 --> 00:16:36.050
they could misuse this,
could also be a way of China

00:16:36.050 --> 00:16:39.270
sort of making African countries
more dependent on itself.

00:16:39.270 --> 00:16:42.950
Or it could also be kind of
China thinking long term,

00:16:42.950 --> 00:16:46.170
it gives loans to countries
that can't pay back these loans.

00:16:46.170 --> 00:16:48.470
And then it can take over, let's say ports

00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:51.520
as it happened in Sri Lanka in 2017.

00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:52.990
And we'll talk about
this a little bit later

00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:55.670
whether these concerns are justified.

00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:58.180
So China also gives us
these loans as part of

00:16:58.180 --> 00:16:59.780
the Belt and Road initiative.

00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:03.440
And this initiative as I
said, was launched in 2013.

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:05.540
And it is part of China's going out

00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:07.410
and going global strategy.

00:17:07.410 --> 00:17:08.440
And China right now

00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:11.930
is building trade
infrastructure in Eurasia.

00:17:11.930 --> 00:17:16.930
And it's really meant to
build trade routes in Eurasia,

00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:20.650
that is going to compete with
the Transatlantic trade route

00:17:20.650 --> 00:17:24.420
that is currently being
dominated by the United States.

00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:27.520
So here you again see this
confidence that China has

00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:29.180
in its own development approach.

00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:30.280
And what's interesting,

00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:33.530
China's already Africa's most
important trading partner.

00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:36.790
And you can look at these
graphs, I'm gonna post them up.

00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:38.770
But really, the essence of this

00:17:38.770 --> 00:17:42.440
is that China is exporting more to Africa

00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:45.180
than Africa is exporting to China.

00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:47.370
And that was also one of the big topics

00:17:47.370 --> 00:17:50.850
that the FOCAC of 2018
that China was asked

00:17:50.850 --> 00:17:54.423
by African countries to also
import more from Africa.

00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:57.010
So as I said,

00:17:57.010 --> 00:17:59.850
loans and trade kind of
dominating the headlines,

00:17:59.850 --> 00:18:03.560
but Chinese investments in
Africa, also a growing sector.

00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:05.020
So you see that the United States

00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:09.280
and the former colonial powers
is still really leading here.

00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:11.770
But if you look at a change of five years,

00:18:11.770 --> 00:18:13.840
they're pretty stable.

00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:15.250
But when you look at China,

00:18:15.250 --> 00:18:17.450
this is really rapidly increasing.

00:18:17.450 --> 00:18:18.950
And I really like this graph here,

00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:20.540
which is the comparison between

00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:24.000
US and Chinese investment flows to Africa.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.860
And when you look at the blue line here,

00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:27.280
I think it shows very nicely that you have

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:30.550
an upward sloping trend line
until the financial crisis

00:18:30.550 --> 00:18:34.540
and then under the Obama
area, those flows really drop.

00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:37.153
And now if we could extend
this to the Trump area,

00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:40.900
Trump he focuses more, he
has more military concerns

00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:44.090
than kind of foreign direct
investment priorities.

00:18:44.090 --> 00:18:45.690
But when we look at China here,

00:18:45.690 --> 00:18:47.290
you see an upward sloping trend line

00:18:47.290 --> 00:18:49.250
and there's one outlier.

00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:53.130
That's when China bought 20% of the shares

00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:55.410
of the Standard Bank in South Africa.

00:18:55.410 --> 00:18:57.330
But I think the essence of this graph

00:18:57.330 --> 00:19:00.410
is really external shocks
really don't matter

00:19:00.410 --> 00:19:02.260
as much to investment flows of China,

00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:05.880
and also changes in political
leadership, et cetera.

00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:10.270
So I think this shows that
China intends to be in Africa

00:19:10.270 --> 00:19:12.290
for a longer, longer future.

00:19:12.290 --> 00:19:14.230
And we can't say really
the same about the US,

00:19:14.230 --> 00:19:16.140
we don't know what's gonna happen.

00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:17.910
And here just to give you an idea,

00:19:17.910 --> 00:19:21.140
investments, Chinese investments
in Africa, very diverse,

00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:22.900
and the biggest sectors are construction,

00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:24.950
transportation, manufacturing.

00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:29.030
And I think this really
nicely fits into Sun's story

00:19:29.030 --> 00:19:31.107
of the Flying Geese Theory

00:19:31.107 --> 00:19:33.113
and the geese flying to Africa now.

00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:36.620
Where we have talked about
the Flying Geese Theory

00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:38.930
a little bit when we talked about China.

00:19:38.930 --> 00:19:42.140
Capital basically moves to
wherever labor is the cheapest,

00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:46.000
and we saw Japan
industrialize in the '50s.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.240
And as labor prices increase there

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:50.410
they moved to other areas in East Asia.

00:19:50.410 --> 00:19:52.860
And now because labor is increasing,

00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:55.040
labor prices are increasing
so much in China.

00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:58.040
We see a lot of Chinese
manufacturers moving to Africa

00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:00.500
and actually, I conducted
a lot of interviews

00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:02.440
with Chinese manufacturers in Africa,

00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:04.980
in Nigeria, Tanzania, Kenya,

00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:06.930
other places that are really said,

00:20:06.930 --> 00:20:09.640
I'm here because this looks
like China in the '70s.

00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:13.013
And it's really amazing labor
is so cheap, land is so cheap.

00:20:15.450 --> 00:20:19.600
So officially, China's
saying that it is interested

00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:23.480
in an economic and sort of
cultural exchange with Africa.

00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:25.620
But people are getting
more and more concerned

00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:27.810
also about China's military presence,

00:20:27.810 --> 00:20:30.640
because right now China is already

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:33.020
the Security Council member that deploys

00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:37.210
the largest amount of troops
under UN command in Africa.

00:20:37.210 --> 00:20:39.390
And what you need to know here is that

00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:41.720
African countries don't really like

00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:45.640
if soldiers from neighboring
countries are deployed

00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:48.020
inside their countries because ethnically

00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:51.240
which is oftentimes
cross national borders.

00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:55.050
So now the AU, the
African Union and the UN

00:20:55.050 --> 00:21:00.050
might like to employ and
have Chinese military

00:21:00.130 --> 00:21:02.700
stationed in these countries
to avoid this problem.

00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:05.010
And then China also set up

00:21:05.010 --> 00:21:07.370
its first military base in Djibouti

00:21:07.370 --> 00:21:10.370
that also raised a lot of
concerns and I have a little clip.

00:21:11.550 --> 00:21:14.100
- [Woman] A fleet of
Chinese ships en route

00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:16.960
to the Horn of Africa on a mission

00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:21.960
to set up China's first overseas
military base in Djibouti.

00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:24.120
China's is the base will be used

00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:27.619
to support peacekeeping
and relief missions.

00:21:27.619 --> 00:21:29.060
(speaking foreign language)

00:21:29.060 --> 00:21:30.450
- [Translator] The
establishment of the base

00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:32.660
will help Chinese vessels escort missions

00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:34.520
in the Gulf of Eden and Somalia

00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:35.910
and international obligations

00:21:35.910 --> 00:21:38.040
such as humanitarian rescue missions.

00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:39.670
It helps China to continue to make

00:21:39.670 --> 00:21:42.860
even greater contributions
to the peace and stability

00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:45.173
of Africa and the rest of the world.

00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:49.840
- [Woman] Construction
began on the base last year.

00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:53.560
Although small, Djibouti
is strategically placed,

00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:55.650
sitting on a busy shipping route

00:21:55.650 --> 00:22:00.360
and a stable country in an
otherwise volatile region.

00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:03.240
China now joins the ranks
of several other nations

00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:05.580
with military bases in Djibouti,

00:22:05.580 --> 00:22:08.313
including the US, France and Japan.

00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:13.490
But China's new base and rapid
modernization of its military

00:22:13.490 --> 00:22:16.450
is raising alarm bells
for neighboring countries,

00:22:16.450 --> 00:22:18.190
particularly India.

00:22:18.190 --> 00:22:20.770
With concern this base
could become another one

00:22:20.770 --> 00:22:23.770
of China's so called string of pearls,

00:22:23.770 --> 00:22:26.410
building up strategic military alliances

00:22:26.410 --> 00:22:28.423
and sea lanes in the region.

00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:31.630
- So I think we can all agree

00:22:31.630 --> 00:22:33.440
that whatever China's doing in Africa,

00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:35.640
it's a very wholistic strategy.

00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:38.720
And China has really increased
its presence in Africa

00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:39.870
in the early 2000s.

00:22:39.870 --> 00:22:42.050
And it seems like it wants to stay

00:22:42.050 --> 00:22:44.163
for a near and medium future.

00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:47.720
So I think there are a
couple of key questions

00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:50.260
that we should be asking
on this relationship

00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:53.410
that really try to get at
what are China's intentions

00:22:53.410 --> 00:22:58.410
but also what is in it
for the African side.

00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:00.380
So first of all, going back to

00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:02.890
our central question from the beginning,

00:23:02.890 --> 00:23:04.660
is China a new colonialist?

00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:08.990
Or is this presence adding
to local development

00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:10.280
on the ground in Africa?

00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:13.890
And are the final colonialists
here by a foreign power

00:23:13.890 --> 00:23:16.650
that tries to take partial
or complete political control

00:23:16.650 --> 00:23:17.930
over another nation,

00:23:17.930 --> 00:23:22.063
as well as engages in
economic exploitation?

00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:25.090
Then the second central question is

00:23:25.090 --> 00:23:27.810
how does China's presence add
to institutional development?

00:23:27.810 --> 00:23:29.933
So sort of more on the political side.

00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:34.380
Does it have good or bad governance?

00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:36.910
Thirdly, are debt trap claims justified?

00:23:36.910 --> 00:23:39.900
And these are all
questions that really media

00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:43.890
and scholarship has been
trying to analyze and answer.

00:23:43.890 --> 00:23:45.690
And I would like to throw
in a fourth question,

00:23:45.690 --> 00:23:48.280
which is how much bargaining
power do African governments

00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:50.010
have in their relationship with China?

00:23:50.010 --> 00:23:51.040
And how do they use it?

00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:55.300
Is there leverage on the
African side to influence

00:23:55.300 --> 00:23:57.963
what this China-Africa
story might look like?

00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:01.440
And so on this key question of China,

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:03.360
is China new colonialist,

00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:07.660
China's officially running
a five nos policy in Africa.

00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:10.850
So it's this five nos
policy is very much based

00:24:10.850 --> 00:24:13.600
on its general policy of non intervention.

00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:15.680
So that's also why China is not supporting

00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:18.210
the responsibility to protect or to keep

00:24:18.210 --> 00:24:21.160
because it's basically saying every nation

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:23.570
is responsible for its own population.

00:24:23.570 --> 00:24:27.020
And we're not going to intervene
with anyone else's affairs,

00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:28.510
as we also don't want anyone

00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:31.040
to step into our domestic politics.

00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:34.350
That's also why China oftentimes vetoes

00:24:34.350 --> 00:24:35.503
sort of intervention.

00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:40.360
So resolutions at the UN,
also with Syria for example.

00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:43.670
So here you see Xi Jinping
talk about his five nos policy

00:24:43.670 --> 00:24:44.675
in Africa.

00:24:44.675 --> 00:24:46.241
(speaks foreign language)

00:24:46.241 --> 00:24:48.730
- [Translator] China values
sincerity, friendship

00:24:48.730 --> 00:24:51.123
and equality in pursuing cooperation.

00:24:51.990 --> 00:24:54.950
The over 1.3 billion
times people have been

00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:57.540
with the over 1.2 billion African people

00:24:57.540 --> 00:24:59.550
in pursuing a shared future.

00:24:59.550 --> 00:25:03.130
We respect Africa, we love
Africa and support Africa.

00:25:03.130 --> 00:25:07.540
We follow a five no approach
in our relations with Africa.

00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:10.330
No interference in
African countries pursuit

00:25:10.330 --> 00:25:13.030
of development path fitting
their national conditions.

00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:17.510
No interference in African
countries internal affairs.

00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:20.823
No imposition of our will
on African countries.

00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:26.313
No attachment of political
strings to systems to Africa.

00:25:27.561 --> 00:25:32.390
And not seeking of selfish political gains

00:25:32.390 --> 00:25:35.103
in investment and financing
cooperation with Africa.

00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:41.160
- So you see here China's
official stance on this is,

00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:43.890
of course, we're not a new colonialist.

00:25:43.890 --> 00:25:47.210
We're not interested in
kind of political control.

00:25:47.210 --> 00:25:48.680
We're just really as I said before,

00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:51.660
interested in economic
and cultural exchange.

00:25:51.660 --> 00:25:53.830
But of course they're
also more critical voices

00:25:53.830 --> 00:25:55.480
on this China-Africa relationship.

00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:56.660
And I brought you here a comic

00:25:56.660 --> 00:25:59.410
by a famous South African artist.

00:25:59.410 --> 00:26:01.970
And you see basically China coming in

00:26:01.970 --> 00:26:03.430
with those big machines,

00:26:03.430 --> 00:26:06.160
and it says China's
industrial colonialism.

00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:09.220
And these machines are going
against the local population.

00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:11.440
And here you also see,

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:14.280
Africa's environment
is also suffering from

00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:18.210
so the expansionary vision
of China and Africa.

00:26:18.210 --> 00:26:21.450
And when you look at
Western newspaper reports,

00:26:21.450 --> 00:26:24.160
there are also a lot of articles like on

00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:26.610
Chinese debt trap diplomacy
again with those loans,

00:26:26.610 --> 00:26:28.580
economical cold war.

00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:30.800
Is it a new colonialism?

00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:33.790
Chinese investments bring
racism and discrimination.

00:26:33.790 --> 00:26:36.530
And I also talked to
locals that have told me

00:26:36.530 --> 00:26:38.920
that the Chinese they
just take all the jobs.

00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:43.210
So it really, everyone is
split about this topic.

00:26:43.210 --> 00:26:46.230
So I would like to have
a poll now on sort of

00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:48.820
from your background
knowledge on China and Africa,

00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:50.990
what do you have heard
from the news, et cetera,

00:26:50.990 --> 00:26:54.453
who thinks that China is a
new colonialist in Africa?

00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:57.103
Okay, that's a lot of people.

00:26:57.103 --> 00:26:58.153
I didn't expect that.

00:26:59.010 --> 00:27:03.310
So who thinks China's influence
in Africa is really kind of

00:27:03.310 --> 00:27:05.050
they're actually better than what

00:27:05.050 --> 00:27:07.580
the former colonialists have done?

00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:09.040
Okay, yeah.

00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:11.640
And who was split on this topic?

00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:12.590
Yeah.

00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:15.140
So I think the vast majority thinks

00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:17.800
that China is the new colonialists.

00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:20.200
So I'll just give you my
opinion on this issue.

00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:23.090
So I think if China is a new colonialist,

00:27:23.090 --> 00:27:24.460
which I actually doubt is,

00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:27.980
first of all, it is a very
different kind of colonialism.

00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:31.540
Because as you've seen
in that famous image,

00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:33.840
53 out of 54 African countries

00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:36.370
actually deliberately selected into it.

00:27:36.370 --> 00:27:38.010
So it wasn't like China,

00:27:38.010 --> 00:27:39.480
just coming to Africa

00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:41.500
and kind of taking over political control.

00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:45.060
but it is they are offering
deals and the Chinese side is

00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:46.240
can either accept them or not.

00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:48.870
And there are a lot of
speeches from African leaders

00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:51.317
from this forum that talk
very favorably about China

00:27:51.317 --> 00:27:53.773
and how their relationship
is different with China

00:27:53.773 --> 00:27:56.120
than with the West because
of this non intervention.

00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:59.770
We also talked about how altropy is

00:27:59.770 --> 00:28:02.000
is sort of Europe centric.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.080
And it could also lend itself to again,

00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:06.020
like colonialist aspirations, et cetera.

00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:09.810
So this is sort of an agreement here.

00:28:09.810 --> 00:28:13.470
But I think obviously,
the Chinese government,

00:28:13.470 --> 00:28:15.440
the West and African leaders,

00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:16.910
they're self interested actors,

00:28:16.910 --> 00:28:18.630
and they're very irrational

00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:21.810
in sort of what narrative
they put out there.

00:28:21.810 --> 00:28:25.100
So I think instead of listening
to what different leaders

00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:26.210
are saying here,

00:28:26.210 --> 00:28:30.243
we should focus more on
impact and the variables

00:28:30.243 --> 00:28:32.400
that we can actually measure of what China

00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:34.470
is doing in Africa.

00:28:34.470 --> 00:28:37.250
And I think there are three
questions that are probably

00:28:37.250 --> 00:28:38.960
the most productive to focus on

00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:41.250
if we want to have a real assessment here

00:28:41.250 --> 00:28:43.630
of whether China is a new colonialist.

00:28:43.630 --> 00:28:45.840
The first one is, is China helping to grow

00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:48.350
and diversify African economies?

00:28:48.350 --> 00:28:50.780
And this one is really important

00:28:50.780 --> 00:28:53.590
from both an economic
development perspective

00:28:53.590 --> 00:28:56.270
but also from an
institutional one and also

00:28:56.270 --> 00:28:58.630
in terms of democratic one.

00:28:58.630 --> 00:29:02.490
First of all, economic
one because we want to see

00:29:02.490 --> 00:29:05.180
with China's presence in Africa,

00:29:05.180 --> 00:29:08.690
are African countries that
are mostly agricultural now,

00:29:08.690 --> 00:29:11.200
are they moving more towards industry?

00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:12.900
And from an institutional perspective,

00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:16.490
I know we started to risk it all in detail

00:29:16.490 --> 00:29:19.270
where they're all saying
we can't really predict

00:29:19.270 --> 00:29:21.350
when a democracy,

00:29:21.350 --> 00:29:23.940
like when the transformation
to a democracy

00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:25.200
becomes more likely.

00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:27.130
But what can we say about its survival?

00:29:27.130 --> 00:29:31.110
So we know that democracies
are more likely to survive

00:29:31.110 --> 00:29:34.690
if they have a higher per
capita income than $14,000

00:29:34.690 --> 00:29:36.913
as well as they have
a diversified economy.

00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:40.900
And then I want to ask two
more questions, which are

00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:43.970
is China adding local human
capital and technology?

00:29:43.970 --> 00:29:45.210
And how does the competition

00:29:45.210 --> 00:29:47.630
with local businesses look like?

00:29:47.630 --> 00:29:50.300
And these two questions
are really inspired

00:29:50.300 --> 00:29:53.050
by China's own growth miracle,

00:29:53.050 --> 00:29:55.940
because when China opened up in 1978,

00:29:55.940 --> 00:29:57.660
it invited a lot of foreign investors

00:29:57.660 --> 00:29:59.780
and provided incentives, all of that,

00:29:59.780 --> 00:30:02.550
to come into specific industries.

00:30:02.550 --> 00:30:04.450
But what's very interesting
about China is that

00:30:04.450 --> 00:30:08.310
it actually kept a pretty strict
foreign investment catalog,

00:30:08.310 --> 00:30:10.273
where it laid out certain sectors

00:30:10.273 --> 00:30:12.850
that were completely restricted
to foreign investment

00:30:12.850 --> 00:30:15.430
and others where foreign
investment was allowed

00:30:15.430 --> 00:30:19.140
and encouraged but had
caps on foreign equity

00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:22.960
that was allowed for a
joint venture requirements

00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:26.250
and also requirements and how
many foreigners were allowed

00:30:26.250 --> 00:30:27.630
on the boards of companies.

00:30:27.630 --> 00:30:29.690
So they're much I summarize,

00:30:29.690 --> 00:30:32.070
this is local participation requirements.

00:30:32.070 --> 00:30:35.970
And China was using them
really as a magnifier effect

00:30:35.970 --> 00:30:40.540
because China was able to import
the technology from abroad

00:30:40.540 --> 00:30:42.410
and get the money from abroad,

00:30:42.410 --> 00:30:44.633
but it built a second of local managers

00:30:44.633 --> 00:30:46.490
that could then run the show.

00:30:46.490 --> 00:30:48.240
And this is also one of the explanations

00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:51.600
as to why China was able to
grow and develop so fast,

00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:54.640
because locals learned
very much and very fast

00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:56.833
from foreigners in their countries.

00:30:57.770 --> 00:31:00.350
And before I dive into my case studies,

00:31:00.350 --> 00:31:01.890
Nigeria and Ethiopia,

00:31:01.890 --> 00:31:03.660
I just wanna point out that,

00:31:03.660 --> 00:31:07.250
this idea that there's One China
Inc. Africa is also flawed.

00:31:07.250 --> 00:31:09.300
So I know we talk about China and Africa,

00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:12.700
now also use the term just
for simplicity reasons.

00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:13.543
But through my research,

00:31:13.543 --> 00:31:16.350
I found that there actually
at least three different types

00:31:16.350 --> 00:31:18.440
of Chinese companies in Africa

00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:22.033
that have very different
incentives that are worth studying.

00:31:23.170 --> 00:31:25.510
So first of all, you have
state owned enterprises,

00:31:25.510 --> 00:31:27.100
and they're very much linked to

00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:30.990
China's sort of state capitalism model.

00:31:30.990 --> 00:31:34.870
They are very dependent on the
Chinese government's control.

00:31:34.870 --> 00:31:38.360
And oftentimes, they're both
driven by an economic incentive

00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:40.870
as well as sort of a different diplomatic

00:31:40.870 --> 00:31:42.300
kind of relationship,

00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:45.080
let's say between China and
Nigeria where these companies

00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:49.211
are allowed to operate at
razor thin profit margins.

00:31:49.211 --> 00:31:53.200
If this is important enough
for the strategic relationship

00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:56.870
between an African country and China.

00:31:56.870 --> 00:32:00.170
Then you also have big
private firms like Huawei

00:32:00.170 --> 00:32:03.230
who come to Africa to really
they're very profit driven.

00:32:03.230 --> 00:32:06.300
I've talked to CEOs from Huawei

00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:11.050
who really want to compete with
Western companies in Africa.

00:32:11.050 --> 00:32:12.730
But they have such a high profile

00:32:12.730 --> 00:32:14.880
that they can't really hide
from the Chinese government.

00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:18.310
And so they're still dependent sort of,

00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:22.470
on China's, the Chinese
government's strategy in Africa,

00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:24.020
and they can just do everything they want,

00:32:24.020 --> 00:32:25.870
because China's actually very concerned

00:32:25.870 --> 00:32:27.450
about its image in Africa.

00:32:27.450 --> 00:32:31.210
So they have still have
to obey by certain rules.

00:32:31.210 --> 00:32:34.330
And then there's a third category
which I particularly find

00:32:34.330 --> 00:32:37.510
very interesting to study
which is small, private firms.

00:32:37.510 --> 00:32:41.420
So how they come to Africa is in two ways.

00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:45.020
So sometimes you have Chinese
state owned enterprises

00:32:45.020 --> 00:32:46.730
being sent to Africa.

00:32:46.730 --> 00:32:49.740
And then employees in the
state owned enterprises

00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:50.573
are realizing, okay,

00:32:50.573 --> 00:32:52.510
we're not really making any money.

00:32:52.510 --> 00:32:56.230
So individual entrepreneurs,
they venture off

00:32:56.230 --> 00:32:58.430
and they open a small company in Africa

00:32:58.430 --> 00:33:02.340
to really make more money than
that sit on the enterprise.

00:33:02.340 --> 00:33:06.550
Or we have some small
Chinese private companies

00:33:06.550 --> 00:33:10.430
already in Africa that do have
friends back home in China.

00:33:10.430 --> 00:33:13.630
And they will tell them all
like land here is really great.

00:33:13.630 --> 00:33:16.460
Like here, the taxes
really low, et cetera.

00:33:16.460 --> 00:33:19.250
So you should come from China to here.

00:33:19.250 --> 00:33:21.690
And they keep a very low profile,

00:33:21.690 --> 00:33:26.360
and they hide a lot from the
Chinese government as well.

00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:28.080
But what I would also like to add is

00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:30.700
the Chinese government doesn't
really care if they hide

00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:33.550
or not as long as you're not
big enough to really matter.

00:33:33.550 --> 00:33:35.130
And if you make an impression,

00:33:35.130 --> 00:33:37.130
if like your company screws up

00:33:37.130 --> 00:33:39.560
and it's gonna be in the news and stuff

00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:40.820
that could be could influence

00:33:40.820 --> 00:33:43.670
this image that China has in Africa.

00:33:43.670 --> 00:33:47.850
So I also talked a lot
of two or three types.

00:33:47.850 --> 00:33:50.730
And as I said, they all have
very different incentives.

00:33:50.730 --> 00:33:52.430
And that matters for the stories

00:33:52.430 --> 00:33:54.173
that I'm going to tell you now.

00:33:55.090 --> 00:33:57.570
So let's first focus on Nigeria.

00:33:57.570 --> 00:34:00.490
So Nigeria as a country in West Africa.

00:34:00.490 --> 00:34:03.390
And just to give you a little
bit of background on Nigeria,

00:34:03.390 --> 00:34:05.970
it has the largest population in Africa,

00:34:05.970 --> 00:34:10.220
and also one of the largest
youth populations in the world

00:34:10.220 --> 00:34:13.110
behind China and India.

00:34:13.110 --> 00:34:15.250
And it's a former British colony,

00:34:15.250 --> 00:34:17.340
and it went through a military period,

00:34:17.340 --> 00:34:18.840
military regime period.

00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:22.030
And it's been formally
democratic since 2015,

00:34:22.030 --> 00:34:24.870
when Jonathan Goodluck
deliberately stepped down

00:34:24.870 --> 00:34:28.040
to Muhammadu Buhari and
democratic elections.

00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:31.460
And Muhammadu Buhari he
just ran for a second term

00:34:31.460 --> 00:34:34.330
in February and I was
actually in the country

00:34:34.330 --> 00:34:35.163
during that time.

00:34:35.163 --> 00:34:37.660
So it was very interesting to observe.

00:34:37.660 --> 00:34:40.950
So what's really interesting
about Nigeria is that

00:34:40.950 --> 00:34:43.000
in the '70s and early '80s,

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.720
it actually had the largest
textile industry in Africa.

00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:49.060
So we had some diversification
of the economy happening.

00:34:49.060 --> 00:34:51.040
But when we fast forward to today,

00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:54.310
80% of all finished
consumer goods are imported.

00:34:54.310 --> 00:34:57.440
And really, the economy
is not diversified at all.

00:34:57.440 --> 00:34:59.640
So what happened there?

00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:04.000
So in 1958, Nigeria discovered
oil, and by the 70s,

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.970
this was really the largest
sector of the economy.

00:35:06.970 --> 00:35:09.430
And I think that led to
really three outcomes.

00:35:09.430 --> 00:35:12.630
So first of all, as we
talked with the Soviet Union,

00:35:12.630 --> 00:35:16.040
if there's one dominant
sector in a country,

00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:19.190
the political elites really
have an interest in keeping that

00:35:19.190 --> 00:35:23.160
one sector dominant because
they can grant access

00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:25.400
to the sector and they
can make a lot of money

00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:28.500
versus if you try to diversify the economy

00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:32.380
and try to provide
alternatives to the population,

00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:36.060
they would not pay you anymore
to get access to the sector.

00:35:36.060 --> 00:35:38.980
Secondly, there's also the
Dutch disease and basically

00:35:38.980 --> 00:35:42.230
as your revenues increase
in one particular sector,

00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:45.530
your currency appreciates
and that makes exports

00:35:45.530 --> 00:35:48.150
from any other sector really expensive.

00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:52.280
So Norway is also an oil rich country,

00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:54.720
has tried to circumvent this issue by

00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:56.020
when it gets the revenues for its oil,

00:35:56.020 --> 00:35:58.170
it doesn't even convert
them into its own currency

00:35:58.170 --> 00:36:00.293
but puts them into funds again abroad.

00:36:03.380 --> 00:36:06.807
So because Nigeria has all this oil,

00:36:06.807 --> 00:36:08.560
its GDP per capita is pretty high,

00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:11.360
but we have very high inequality.

00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:14.330
And it is one of the top
receivers of Chinese investments.

00:36:14.330 --> 00:36:18.200
And those are not just
investments in natural resources.

00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:20.320
But I also talked to a lot
of manufacturers there,

00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:22.920
people in the service sector

00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:25.250
so it's a very attractive market

00:36:25.250 --> 00:36:27.930
because you have a huge population,

00:36:27.930 --> 00:36:30.283
very cheap land and very cheap labor.

00:36:31.330 --> 00:36:34.010
And what's important to note
about Nigeria as well finally

00:36:34.010 --> 00:36:38.390
is that it really adapted the
structural adjustment programs

00:36:38.390 --> 00:36:39.430
and went with it.

00:36:39.430 --> 00:36:44.380
So in 1995 it allowed 100%
foreign ownership in all sectors.

00:36:44.380 --> 00:36:47.170
And really, if you're a
foreign investor in Nigeria,

00:36:47.170 --> 00:36:49.260
you can basically do whatever you want.

00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:51.823
So you can compete with locals,

00:36:52.984 --> 00:36:55.460
you can make money there and
you can export it abroad.

00:36:55.460 --> 00:36:58.173
So you can really have
a lot of leeway there.

00:36:59.300 --> 00:37:01.320
So let's look at growth
and diversification,

00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:03.870
as I said like that is
one of our key questions,

00:37:03.870 --> 00:37:07.260
is China's presence adding to
growth and diversification?

00:37:07.260 --> 00:37:09.540
And here you see that Nigeria actually

00:37:09.540 --> 00:37:12.100
just emerged out of a recession.

00:37:12.100 --> 00:37:15.361
And that was because of a
drop in global oil prices

00:37:15.361 --> 00:37:20.361
and output chalking,
Nigerian and advocate policy

00:37:20.390 --> 00:37:22.180
to really respond to this.

00:37:22.180 --> 00:37:26.400
And here you see how much Nigeria is,

00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:28.270
is really dependent on the oil industry,

00:37:28.270 --> 00:37:30.720
because over the past 20 years,

00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:33.010
the value added from
industry actually declines

00:37:33.010 --> 00:37:35.030
so we don't see any diversification

00:37:35.030 --> 00:37:37.513
happening over the past
20 years unfortunately.

00:37:38.430 --> 00:37:41.990
So let's hone in a little
bit on how China's presence

00:37:41.990 --> 00:37:45.680
is really adding maybe
something to diversification

00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:48.970
and local participation in Nigeria.

00:37:48.970 --> 00:37:52.510
And what's interesting to
note here is that in 2006,

00:37:52.510 --> 00:37:55.660
at another form of
China-Africa cooperation,

00:37:55.660 --> 00:37:57.720
China announced that it wants to build

00:37:57.720 --> 00:38:00.850
eight special economic zones in Africa.

00:38:00.850 --> 00:38:03.710
And that was really based
on this idea that China

00:38:03.710 --> 00:38:06.120
used special economic
zones in the beginning

00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:08.910
of its opening up to really
experiment with capitalism.

00:38:08.910 --> 00:38:12.870
And so they suggested kind
of as a policy strategy,

00:38:12.870 --> 00:38:14.310
you should also build these zones

00:38:14.310 --> 00:38:17.070
and have tax incentives, tax holidays,

00:38:17.070 --> 00:38:18.950
and let's see what
happens but the difference

00:38:18.950 --> 00:38:22.210
is that these zones are much
smaller than the ones in China.

00:38:22.210 --> 00:38:27.210
So that's why they might
not be working effectively.

00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:31.790
But Nigeria got two zones
during this bidding process,

00:38:31.790 --> 00:38:34.940
the Lekki Free Trade Zone
and the Ogun Guangdong Zone,

00:38:34.940 --> 00:38:39.150
and both are very much
top down joint venture,

00:38:39.150 --> 00:38:43.630
joint venture project between
state governments in Nigeria,

00:38:43.630 --> 00:38:46.163
as well as Chinese
state owned enterprises.

00:38:48.220 --> 00:38:49.610
And I will show you a video now

00:38:49.610 --> 00:38:51.573
from the Lekki Free Trade Zone.

00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:54.170
- For many African countries,

00:38:54.170 --> 00:38:57.571
attracting foreign investments
has always been a challenge.

00:38:57.571 --> 00:38:59.380
And now it's become even more difficult

00:38:59.380 --> 00:39:02.630
with an economic downturn in
Europe and the United States.

00:39:02.630 --> 00:39:04.850
So here's how some African
countries have responded.

00:39:04.850 --> 00:39:07.290
They set up what are
known as free trade zones.

00:39:07.290 --> 00:39:10.200
These are places where
multinationals can come in,

00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:12.410
set up shop and in some cases,

00:39:12.410 --> 00:39:15.210
a little or sometimes no tax at all.

00:39:15.210 --> 00:39:16.780
It really does beg the question,

00:39:16.780 --> 00:39:19.290
what's in it for the ordinary African.

00:39:19.290 --> 00:39:22.390
Mark Edwards been checking
up on that in Nigeria,

00:39:22.390 --> 00:39:23.923
Africa's most populous nation.

00:39:25.490 --> 00:39:28.060
- [Mark] In Lagos they
hope this will be the road

00:39:28.060 --> 00:39:30.160
to economic success.

00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:32.300
The Lekki Free Trade Zone is being carved

00:39:32.300 --> 00:39:35.130
out of thousands of
hectares of untamed land

00:39:35.130 --> 00:39:37.763
near the coast of Nigeria's
commercial capital.

00:39:39.470 --> 00:39:43.420
- The first part is 3,000 hectares.

00:39:43.420 --> 00:39:46.810
- [Mark] They call Sola Oworu
the Empress of the zone.

00:39:46.810 --> 00:39:49.400
This former city banker
is in charge of creating

00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:53.610
what she believes will become
the Dubai of West Africa.

00:39:53.610 --> 00:39:57.440
- The idea is actually to
create a new model city,

00:39:57.440 --> 00:40:02.440
not just industrial, also a
residential, commercial area,

00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:05.820
so that you have a self sustaining city.

00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:08.240
- [Mark] While Lagos
State providing the land,

00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:10.660
a Chinese consortium is responsible

00:40:10.660 --> 00:40:12.590
for the actual construction.

00:40:12.590 --> 00:40:14.200
There's a lot to build.

00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:17.310
The zone will have its
own international airport,

00:40:17.310 --> 00:40:22.310
deep sea port, and its own
water, power and sewage systems.

00:40:22.710 --> 00:40:25.260
- The idea is to have
the zone as a catalyst

00:40:25.260 --> 00:40:28.130
for economic development in Lagos State,

00:40:28.130 --> 00:40:29.840
diversify the economy,

00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:32.760
we would want to attract
foreign direct investments

00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:34.660
into Lagos State.

00:40:34.660 --> 00:40:38.440
- There are 23 other Free
Trade Zones in Nigeria,

00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:41.740
all vying for the attentions
of international investors.

00:40:41.740 --> 00:40:43.750
But the Lekki Free
Trade Zone here in Lagos

00:40:43.750 --> 00:40:46.690
has one big advantage, size.

00:40:46.690 --> 00:40:51.220
At 16,500 hectares it could
become the biggest in Africa,

00:40:51.220 --> 00:40:54.193
four times the size of
Manhattan in New York.

00:40:56.050 --> 00:40:59.020
- So this is a video from 2013.

00:40:59.020 --> 00:41:02.360
And what's striking here is
that you can't really see

00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:03.600
the zone itself, right?

00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:05.560
So I tried to find videos where you have

00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:08.990
some video footage, what
it actually looks like,

00:41:08.990 --> 00:41:11.760
but I couldn't so I would
have liked to show you.

00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:13.300
So I was wondering about that myself.

00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:16.460
So I went to the zone and I
drove there and when you arrive

00:41:16.460 --> 00:41:19.160
there's a really nice building in front

00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:20.300
with the administration

00:41:20.300 --> 00:41:23.010
and like they welcomed me
and I could talk to the MD,

00:41:23.010 --> 00:41:25.680
the managing director on the Nigerian side

00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:27.920
as well as on the Chinese
side and everyone said,

00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:30.110
yeah, the zone is gonna be amazing

00:41:30.110 --> 00:41:31.923
and like all of that potential

00:41:31.923 --> 00:41:35.590
and it really is going super well.

00:41:35.590 --> 00:41:38.850
And then a team of engineers
took me around the zone.

00:41:38.850 --> 00:41:42.540
So we came behind the
administration building,

00:41:42.540 --> 00:41:46.570
and what you could really
see was not that much,

00:41:46.570 --> 00:41:47.810
because there wasn't.

00:41:47.810 --> 00:41:51.320
So there was some basic
infrastructure built.

00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:54.273
But I was driven around and
I talked to a few companies

00:41:54.273 --> 00:41:57.840
that were really only 14 fully operating

00:41:57.840 --> 00:41:59.850
Chinese companies in the zone.

00:41:59.850 --> 00:42:04.290
And that was after 13 years
of being built, right?

00:42:04.290 --> 00:42:08.560
So I think it lags a little
bit behind expectations.

00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:11.960
And one of the reasons I see is really,

00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:14.280
because it's more of a
top down joint venture

00:42:14.280 --> 00:42:15.760
between two governments.

00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:16.890
So as I said before,

00:42:16.890 --> 00:42:19.860
you have Chinese state
owned enterprise involved.

00:42:19.860 --> 00:42:23.930
And it is kind of bound to
this diplomatic relationship

00:42:23.930 --> 00:42:27.050
between Nigeria and China
and it is a prestige project.

00:42:27.050 --> 00:42:30.160
So that's why they build a
lot of infrastructure there.

00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:33.240
But how to make the zone actually
work is a different story.

00:42:33.240 --> 00:42:35.300
It is a very profit driven story.

00:42:35.300 --> 00:42:38.860
And when I saw kind of
the management building

00:42:38.860 --> 00:42:40.590
and then like the office is there,

00:42:40.590 --> 00:42:42.500
they're very comfortable in that position,

00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:45.640
I don't really see that
big of an incentive to go

00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:48.310
out of your way to really
attract all of these companies.

00:42:48.310 --> 00:42:52.910
So while there's tax holidays,
so no taxes inside the zone,

00:42:52.910 --> 00:42:55.240
there's a very high
management fee actually.

00:42:55.240 --> 00:42:57.240
And I talked to companies
that had considered

00:42:57.240 --> 00:42:59.540
moving into Lekki Free Trade Zone,

00:42:59.540 --> 00:43:01.210
but they didn't find it profitable

00:43:01.210 --> 00:43:02.560
because they were too small

00:43:03.910 --> 00:43:05.360
for the management fee to make sense.

00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:08.820
And finally, they were also
locals that have been protesting

00:43:08.820 --> 00:43:10.860
because of resettlements.

00:43:10.860 --> 00:43:12.070
'Cause that used to be their land

00:43:12.070 --> 00:43:14.020
who have been protesting a lot.

00:43:14.020 --> 00:43:15.320
And in 2012 actually,

00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:18.200
one of the managers of
the zone got killed.

00:43:18.200 --> 00:43:21.340
So they'll have problems to make the zone

00:43:21.340 --> 00:43:23.550
really, really work and profitable.

00:43:23.550 --> 00:43:26.210
And we have a similar
story for Ogun Guangdong.

00:43:26.210 --> 00:43:29.670
So now though I would say it
is performing slightly better.

00:43:29.670 --> 00:43:33.500
So it was started with a
Chinese state owned enterprise.

00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:36.900
And then they were caught up
in some smuggling problems.

00:43:36.900 --> 00:43:40.140
And then a Chinese company
actually took over the zone,

00:43:40.140 --> 00:43:41.620
the management of the zones.

00:43:41.620 --> 00:43:43.900
And they were more
interested in kind of making

00:43:43.900 --> 00:43:46.470
the zone work because they
were more profit driven.

00:43:46.470 --> 00:43:48.860
But then the Chinese
government kicked them out,

00:43:48.860 --> 00:43:51.400
I believe two years ago and put in again,

00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:53.510
a Chinese Special Economic, SOE,

00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:56.390
State Owned Enterprise,

00:43:56.390 --> 00:43:59.800
because they felt like they
had more control over what

00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:02.290
that company could be doing
with this prestige project,

00:44:02.290 --> 00:44:05.040
which meant a lot for the
diplomatic relationship

00:44:05.040 --> 00:44:08.900
between Nigeria and China.

00:44:08.900 --> 00:44:10.280
And there's a very interesting story

00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:11.630
that I would like to share with you.

00:44:11.630 --> 00:44:14.200
Professor Shapiro and
I, we both separately,

00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:19.090
interviewed the private management
at that time of the zone.

00:44:19.090 --> 00:44:21.230
And they told us they had one big problem,

00:44:21.230 --> 00:44:25.370
which was someone was
blowing up the gas pipelines

00:44:25.370 --> 00:44:27.230
that were coming to the zone.

00:44:27.230 --> 00:44:31.203
So who do you think was
blowing up these pipelines?

00:44:32.950 --> 00:44:33.783
Yes.

00:44:35.590 --> 00:44:37.380
No, it was not terrorists.

00:44:37.380 --> 00:44:38.690
Yeah.

00:44:38.690 --> 00:44:41.510
So what's really interesting
is that you actually had locals

00:44:41.510 --> 00:44:43.360
blowing up these gas pipelines

00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:47.010
because they started sort
of as a local competition,

00:44:47.010 --> 00:44:51.140
or like as a foreign project
that they weren't really

00:44:51.140 --> 00:44:53.190
being able to have any advantage of.

00:44:53.190 --> 00:44:56.210
So again, have locals seeing the zone

00:44:56.210 --> 00:44:57.440
and like seeing the infrastructure,

00:44:57.440 --> 00:45:00.110
but not really being able to participate.

00:45:00.110 --> 00:45:02.320
And as I said like in Nigeria,

00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:04.740
you can kind of just come
in as a foreign company

00:45:04.740 --> 00:45:07.690
and you don't have to employ
locals or train locals

00:45:07.690 --> 00:45:10.320
or have them on or kind
of give them ownership.

00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:14.000
So I've heard a lot of
stories of competition

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:16.890
between Chinese companies
and Nigerian ones.

00:45:16.890 --> 00:45:21.830
And obviously competition
is good for kind of growth.

00:45:21.830 --> 00:45:25.840
But there's also the flip
side of local inclusion.

00:45:25.840 --> 00:45:27.500
So I guess that is the trade off here.

00:45:27.500 --> 00:45:29.580
And I know these stories
are just anecdotal.

00:45:29.580 --> 00:45:32.190
So I have like, for example,

00:45:32.190 --> 00:45:34.740
in the bike ride hailing services,

00:45:34.740 --> 00:45:36.950
and there's a really aggressive
Chinese company right now

00:45:36.950 --> 00:45:38.050
or in the FinTech industry,

00:45:38.050 --> 00:45:42.210
whether a lot of Chinese companies
Offering loans to locals,

00:45:42.210 --> 00:45:43.980
just competing on price alone.

00:45:43.980 --> 00:45:46.560
And I'm going to conduct
a survey experiment

00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:49.180
with Chinese companies
next semester in Nigeria

00:45:49.180 --> 00:45:51.403
to kind of get more at the trend here.

00:45:52.420 --> 00:45:54.290
So I don't only wanna talk about

00:45:54.290 --> 00:45:55.630
negative things about Nigeria,

00:45:55.630 --> 00:45:58.000
so they also some positive
developments here.

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:01.670
So for example, Aliko Dangote,

00:46:01.670 --> 00:46:04.590
he's the richest African right now.

00:46:04.590 --> 00:46:07.610
And what you need to know
about Nigeria is that

00:46:07.610 --> 00:46:09.490
it exports all of its crude oil

00:46:09.490 --> 00:46:10.960
and imports the refined oil,

00:46:10.960 --> 00:46:14.650
because it's not doing the
refining itself domestically.

00:46:14.650 --> 00:46:17.480
So Aliko Dangote is now currently building

00:46:17.480 --> 00:46:19.070
an oil gas refinery,

00:46:19.070 --> 00:46:22.030
in Lekki Free Trade Zone
to solve this problem.

00:46:22.030 --> 00:46:25.590
And I talked to locals and
they generally actually feel

00:46:25.590 --> 00:46:27.630
positive about it because they're excited

00:46:27.630 --> 00:46:29.400
that this is now finally

00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:31.660
that there's some domestic refinery here.

00:46:31.660 --> 00:46:34.530
I would be a little bit
cautious because 20 years ago,

00:46:34.530 --> 00:46:38.010
Nigeria had this law that
not one private businessman

00:46:38.010 --> 00:46:41.590
could own that much oil in that industry

00:46:41.590 --> 00:46:44.220
just because of national
security concerns, right?

00:46:44.220 --> 00:46:46.700
And I think Aliko Dangote

00:46:46.700 --> 00:46:49.300
is getting a lot of political
power because of this now,

00:46:49.300 --> 00:46:51.120
because he controls,

00:46:51.120 --> 00:46:53.370
he can just stop the oil immediately.

00:46:53.370 --> 00:46:55.650
He is also, I heard he
wants to also sell it

00:46:55.650 --> 00:46:57.670
at kind of international prices.

00:46:57.670 --> 00:46:59.920
And if the government
doesn't really comply

00:46:59.920 --> 00:47:00.900
with what he wants,

00:47:00.900 --> 00:47:03.350
he can just easily export the oil as well,

00:47:03.350 --> 00:47:05.090
because he's in the Lekki Free Trade Zone

00:47:05.090 --> 00:47:07.283
where they have an airport and a seaport.

00:47:08.220 --> 00:47:09.670
But what I'm more excited about

00:47:09.670 --> 00:47:11.700
are these small Chinese industrial parks.

00:47:11.700 --> 00:47:15.670
And I know you also had to
read an article on this.

00:47:15.670 --> 00:47:17.713
Where through an interview,

00:47:18.685 --> 00:47:22.680
a local Nigerian broker who
work with Chinese companies,

00:47:22.680 --> 00:47:25.673
he invited me to his village and he said,

00:47:27.649 --> 00:47:30.480
I live in this village
where the local chief

00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:33.260
he set up an industrial park with Chinese

00:47:33.260 --> 00:47:34.200
and I should come visit.

00:47:34.200 --> 00:47:35.810
So I drove there for a weekend

00:47:35.810 --> 00:47:38.880
and I interviewed all the
Chinese companies there

00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:40.960
and I also talked to the local chief.

00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:44.220
He invited me for tea and
we just sat and chatted.

00:47:44.220 --> 00:47:46.750
And this looks like much
more like a bottom up

00:47:46.750 --> 00:47:50.810
sort of win-win situation
where in the '90s,

00:47:50.810 --> 00:47:52.410
a Chinese businessman, a private one

00:47:52.410 --> 00:47:55.460
came to that village and he
wanted to do some fishing there.

00:47:55.460 --> 00:48:00.450
So his people they built two
houses for the village chief,

00:48:00.450 --> 00:48:01.750
for his palace.

00:48:01.750 --> 00:48:03.660
And kind of as an exchange,

00:48:03.660 --> 00:48:04.990
he was allowed to fish there

00:48:04.990 --> 00:48:07.633
and then he brought more and more people,

00:48:07.633 --> 00:48:09.330
small, private Chinese firms

00:48:09.330 --> 00:48:11.130
and they build this industrial park.

00:48:11.130 --> 00:48:14.880
And they prefer being in
that small industrial park

00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:17.610
to being in the big ones
because it's located

00:48:17.610 --> 00:48:20.970
on a very strategic street that goes

00:48:20.970 --> 00:48:24.150
from the south to the north
and they produce mattresses

00:48:24.150 --> 00:48:25.550
and slippers and all of that

00:48:25.550 --> 00:48:27.810
and they actually also get tax benefits

00:48:27.810 --> 00:48:30.350
from the state government

00:48:30.350 --> 00:48:33.200
because the village chief
talks to the state government

00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:34.643
and they also employ locals

00:48:34.643 --> 00:48:38.930
and have them not as office managers,

00:48:38.930 --> 00:48:40.340
but at least as floor managers.

00:48:40.340 --> 00:48:42.543
So there seems to be more promise here.

00:48:43.750 --> 00:48:46.690
So I wanna contrast the Nigerian
case with the Ethiopian one

00:48:46.690 --> 00:48:50.090
and Ethiopia is a country in East Africa.

00:48:50.090 --> 00:48:50.930
And I'm comparing it

00:48:50.930 --> 00:48:53.830
because it is the second most
populous country in Africa.

00:48:53.830 --> 00:48:58.610
So similar in size, it
has never been colonized.

00:48:58.610 --> 00:49:01.300
Except for a short period
of where the Italians

00:49:01.300 --> 00:49:04.590
occupied Ethiopia during
the Second World War.

00:49:04.590 --> 00:49:06.820
It went through a communist era.

00:49:06.820 --> 00:49:10.480
But then what's really interesting
is starting in the 1990s,

00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:13.320
where you have an
authoritarian regime, arising

00:49:13.320 --> 00:49:16.470
the Ethiopian People's
Revolutionary Democratic Front.

00:49:16.470 --> 00:49:18.010
And Ethiopia also went through

00:49:18.010 --> 00:49:19.490
structural adjustment programs,

00:49:19.490 --> 00:49:21.230
but they didn't apply them one to one.

00:49:21.230 --> 00:49:22.990
They sort of like China

00:49:22.990 --> 00:49:25.270
that also went through
structural adjustment,

00:49:25.270 --> 00:49:28.220
took the pieces that they
felt like that would work

00:49:28.220 --> 00:49:29.930
in their country and
left everything else out.

00:49:29.930 --> 00:49:33.870
So in 2002, they adopted an
industrial policy strategy.

00:49:33.870 --> 00:49:35.440
And that transformed into two

00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:37.910
growth and transformations
plans that are very much based

00:49:37.910 --> 00:49:40.980
on the Chinese and Korean
developmental models.

00:49:40.980 --> 00:49:45.640
And when we look at Western
investment flows to Ethiopia,

00:49:45.640 --> 00:49:48.320
after 2003, they have like really declined

00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:49.620
because there was sort of,

00:49:51.060 --> 00:49:53.270
the Western companies
weren't able to just operate

00:49:53.270 --> 00:49:54.820
in this market anymore,

00:49:54.820 --> 00:49:57.010
because like in China
it was more strategic,

00:49:57.010 --> 00:49:58.140
like some sectors were closed,

00:49:58.140 --> 00:50:00.610
some are open to foreign investment.

00:50:00.610 --> 00:50:04.490
But Chinese investments
stocks meanwhile, rose a lot.

00:50:04.490 --> 00:50:06.340
And it's already ranked 11th

00:50:06.340 --> 00:50:08.320
for amount of Chinese
investment stocks in Africa.

00:50:08.320 --> 00:50:12.663
And I expect it's gonna
join the top 10 very soon.

00:50:13.550 --> 00:50:16.870
So when we think about
growth and diversification

00:50:16.870 --> 00:50:20.920
in Ethiopia, this is a
much more positive story.

00:50:20.920 --> 00:50:24.010
Although Ethiopia is also
starting from a much lower level,

00:50:24.010 --> 00:50:26.220
of course, and it's much
poorer than Nigeria,

00:50:26.220 --> 00:50:28.020
because it doesn't have this oil wealth.

00:50:28.020 --> 00:50:31.440
So now Ethiopia is actually
the fastest growing economy

00:50:31.440 --> 00:50:33.810
in Africa right now.

00:50:33.810 --> 00:50:36.230
And it's in the news for that a lot.

00:50:36.230 --> 00:50:37.810
When we look at industrialization,

00:50:37.810 --> 00:50:39.640
this graph looks very positive,

00:50:39.640 --> 00:50:43.320
but actually when you compare
over the past 20 years,

00:50:43.320 --> 00:50:48.240
the shelf industry has only
grown by I believe it's 11%.

00:50:48.240 --> 00:50:50.360
And most of it is coming
from construction,

00:50:50.360 --> 00:50:52.770
which is kind of the pre-stage
for industrialization.

00:50:52.770 --> 00:50:55.900
So it looks promising,
but we aren't there yet.

00:50:55.900 --> 00:50:58.200
And actually, we see a lot of movement

00:50:58.200 --> 00:51:00.450
from the agricultural
sector towards services.

00:51:00.450 --> 00:51:05.083
So Ethiopia looks more like
India now, than Korea or China,

00:51:06.180 --> 00:51:08.943
although it has this
industrialization policy so.

00:51:09.850 --> 00:51:11.560
What are some positive developments

00:51:11.560 --> 00:51:14.290
here by the Ethiopian government
that were implemented?

00:51:14.290 --> 00:51:15.420
So first of all,

00:51:15.420 --> 00:51:17.970
Ethiopia has really tried to ramp up

00:51:17.970 --> 00:51:21.550
primary education enrollment
over the past 10 years,

00:51:21.550 --> 00:51:23.920
and it isn't that 100% now so obviously,

00:51:23.920 --> 00:51:27.310
this isn't the perfect
measure of quality education,

00:51:27.310 --> 00:51:31.090
but it's one measure to look
at sort of human capital stocks

00:51:31.090 --> 00:51:34.890
and then how there's human
capital growing in the economy.

00:51:34.890 --> 00:51:37.210
And as I said Ethiopia
is also very strategic

00:51:37.210 --> 00:51:39.020
and has a local content initiative

00:51:39.020 --> 00:51:40.630
where some sectors are
completely closed off

00:51:40.630 --> 00:51:41.910
to foreign investors.

00:51:41.910 --> 00:51:43.630
In some sectors, they are open

00:51:43.630 --> 00:51:46.290
but there are a lot of
incentives for joint ventures.

00:51:46.290 --> 00:51:50.060
And even informal sort of deals.

00:51:50.060 --> 00:51:53.250
Investors are always expected
to come up with a strategy

00:51:53.250 --> 00:51:56.970
and a proposal of how
locals are going to benefit

00:51:56.970 --> 00:51:59.303
from this investment that is being made.

00:52:00.710 --> 00:52:03.110
However, there's the study
by Blattman and Dercon,

00:52:03.110 --> 00:52:04.250
which I found very interesting.

00:52:04.250 --> 00:52:06.480
They tracked industrial workers

00:52:06.480 --> 00:52:09.550
in five different factories in Ethiopia,

00:52:09.550 --> 00:52:13.230
and actually 70% of them
quit after one year.

00:52:13.230 --> 00:52:16.690
So again like there's
potential in Ethiopia

00:52:16.690 --> 00:52:18.730
for industrialization,

00:52:18.730 --> 00:52:20.950
but it seems like there are more options

00:52:20.950 --> 00:52:23.190
still in the agricultural
and informal sectors

00:52:23.190 --> 00:52:25.410
and people aren't really picking up these

00:52:25.410 --> 00:52:28.090
industrial jobs yet on
or running with them.

00:52:28.090 --> 00:52:33.090
So I do think
industrialization is happening

00:52:33.260 --> 00:52:34.130
in Ethiopia right now.

00:52:34.130 --> 00:52:37.080
But locals should be incentivized
to pick up these jobs

00:52:37.080 --> 00:52:39.980
and stay for longer and they
were also health concerns.

00:52:39.980 --> 00:52:44.980
So there were a bunch several
blocks to move out of the way.

00:52:45.140 --> 00:52:47.900
And here's the Eastern Industry Park.

00:52:47.900 --> 00:52:51.300
And this is also one of these eight

00:52:51.300 --> 00:52:55.730
Chinese special economic zones
that were placed in Africa,

00:52:55.730 --> 00:52:58.850
after China announced they
want to build them in 2006.

00:52:58.850 --> 00:53:01.420
But this is a very,
very different approach

00:53:01.420 --> 00:53:03.050
to what we saw in Nigeria,

00:53:03.050 --> 00:53:05.410
because this is actually a bottom up,

00:53:05.410 --> 00:53:06.480
very private initiative.

00:53:06.480 --> 00:53:08.180
So it's a private Park.

00:53:08.180 --> 00:53:10.610
And there was one Chinese businessman

00:53:10.610 --> 00:53:12.450
that came to Ethiopia in 2006.

00:53:12.450 --> 00:53:14.880
And he wanted to build a pipe factory.

00:53:14.880 --> 00:53:16.887
But then he heard about these biddings

00:53:16.887 --> 00:53:19.060
for these special economic zones.

00:53:19.060 --> 00:53:20.070
And he applied for one

00:53:20.070 --> 00:53:22.690
and he brought one of them to Ethiopia.

00:53:22.690 --> 00:53:23.523
And in the beginning,

00:53:23.523 --> 00:53:25.840
the Ethiopian government
was very much against it,

00:53:25.840 --> 00:53:29.170
it was like very skeptical
of what was happening there.

00:53:29.170 --> 00:53:31.400
But this private Chinese businessman,

00:53:31.400 --> 00:53:34.560
he brought government
officials from Ethiopia

00:53:34.560 --> 00:53:37.230
to see the zones in China.

00:53:37.230 --> 00:53:40.410
And over a while the Ethiopian government

00:53:40.410 --> 00:53:43.110
really got into this idea
of special economic zones.

00:53:43.110 --> 00:53:47.730
And in 2015, they even implemented
industrial zone framework

00:53:47.730 --> 00:53:51.140
and they have four more
zones planned now here

00:53:51.140 --> 00:53:53.970
and there are 83 Chinese companies

00:53:53.970 --> 00:53:55.300
operating in the zone already,

00:53:55.300 --> 00:53:57.440
although it's much smaller
than the ones in Nigeria.

00:53:57.440 --> 00:54:00.710
So you have some footage from there.

00:54:00.710 --> 00:54:02.730
- [Girum] If you look for some of the best

00:54:02.730 --> 00:54:06.510
China based companies operating in Africa,

00:54:06.510 --> 00:54:08.730
chances are you'll find most

00:54:08.730 --> 00:54:11.660
in this humongous industry zone.

00:54:11.660 --> 00:54:15.530
Located about 30 kilometers
outside of Ethiopia's capital,

00:54:15.530 --> 00:54:18.010
Addis Ababa, the Eastern Industry Zone

00:54:18.010 --> 00:54:23.010
is a place for the multi
faceted industries from China.

00:54:23.250 --> 00:54:28.250
- This industry is first
industry in Ethiopia.

00:54:28.290 --> 00:54:33.290
And this industry is a wide
stage for the foreign investor.

00:54:35.750 --> 00:54:40.210
And this one is we get support

00:54:40.210 --> 00:54:44.280
from both of Ethiopia
and China government,

00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:46.970
because they know in China government,

00:54:46.970 --> 00:54:51.890
we have the experience, how
to build these industries,

00:54:53.880 --> 00:54:58.523
and how important to attract
the foreign investor.

00:54:59.440 --> 00:55:04.350
Also now Ethiopia, they want
to develop the industry.

00:55:04.350 --> 00:55:06.170
And now they know.

00:55:06.170 --> 00:55:09.010
- [Girum] Since its
inception seven years ago,

00:55:09.010 --> 00:55:12.140
the Eastern Industry
Zone has been showcasing

00:55:12.140 --> 00:55:15.940
Chinese industrial developments
positive impact here.

00:55:15.940 --> 00:55:20.060
The zone now houses best
Chinese manufacturers

00:55:20.060 --> 00:55:24.090
such as Huazhan Shoes and Lifan Motors.

00:55:24.090 --> 00:55:27.560
Here there is already
a conducive environment

00:55:27.560 --> 00:55:30.190
for any investor to operate.

00:55:30.190 --> 00:55:32.190
And that according to the management

00:55:32.190 --> 00:55:35.003
of the Eastern Industry Zone is key.

00:55:35.850 --> 00:55:40.150
- Now Ethiopian they give good condition.

00:55:40.150 --> 00:55:44.612
They support us like one stop surveys,

00:55:44.612 --> 00:55:48.790
like the customers credit lines,

00:55:48.790 --> 00:55:52.603
inside industries, they
give good service very easy.

00:55:54.555 --> 00:55:56.680
And the here is peaceful.

00:55:56.680 --> 00:55:58.470
- Now the future equally matters

00:55:58.470 --> 00:56:00.640
for Ethiopia's manufacturing sector.

00:56:00.640 --> 00:56:03.960
There is already a big
ambition to make the nation

00:56:03.960 --> 00:56:06.230
Africa's manufacturing hub.

00:56:06.230 --> 00:56:10.090
For that Ethiopia eyes the
new Belt and Road Initiative

00:56:10.090 --> 00:56:12.623
to make all the dreams a reality.

00:56:14.780 --> 00:56:17.640
- So actually there have
been a few academic studies

00:56:17.640 --> 00:56:19.230
done on the zone.

00:56:19.230 --> 00:56:22.360
And what they found was
that actually companies

00:56:22.360 --> 00:56:24.530
are training locals.

00:56:24.530 --> 00:56:27.680
Because as I said, the
Ethiopian government sort of

00:56:27.680 --> 00:56:30.320
informally requires that
you come up with a proposal

00:56:30.320 --> 00:56:32.130
on how locals benefit.

00:56:32.130 --> 00:56:34.800
It isn't like for the entire zone,

00:56:34.800 --> 00:56:37.520
that there's one sort
of strategy so I think

00:56:37.520 --> 00:56:39.010
that could be one improvement here,

00:56:39.010 --> 00:56:40.870
but at least you see some development.

00:56:40.870 --> 00:56:42.830
That's the locals are being trained

00:56:42.830 --> 00:56:46.460
and that local human stocks
of capital are going up.

00:56:46.460 --> 00:56:48.400
So I wanna make a final point here

00:56:48.400 --> 00:56:51.741
on sort of what's in it
for foreign investors

00:56:51.741 --> 00:56:56.010
on obeying with local
participation requirements.

00:56:56.010 --> 00:56:58.510
And I wanna talk about the
state of emergency in Ethiopia.

00:56:58.510 --> 00:57:00.410
I was actually there during that time.

00:57:01.330 --> 00:57:06.220
And basically the state of
emergency broke out after the

00:57:06.220 --> 00:57:08.660
Ethiopian government wanted to expand

00:57:10.060 --> 00:57:12.900
the borders of Addis Ababa,
the capital to the south

00:57:12.900 --> 00:57:15.790
to have like an industrial
kind of area there

00:57:15.790 --> 00:57:18.850
and protests broke out in
the Oromo and Amhara regions,

00:57:18.850 --> 00:57:20.840
and it cost them ethnic tensions,

00:57:20.840 --> 00:57:24.940
and a lot of protests
and arrests, et cetera.

00:57:24.940 --> 00:57:27.440
And during these protests,

00:57:27.440 --> 00:57:31.160
locals really went to foreign
companies and destroyed them

00:57:31.160 --> 00:57:33.860
because they felt like
they weren't part of this

00:57:33.860 --> 00:57:36.677
growth story that
Ethiopia was telling them

00:57:36.677 --> 00:57:39.100
and also you could hear in Western media.

00:57:39.100 --> 00:57:42.950
So I had a very interesting
story from an interviewee there

00:57:42.950 --> 00:57:44.560
that there was Aliko Dangote,

00:57:44.560 --> 00:57:47.700
which is the richest man of
Africa had one factory there.

00:57:47.700 --> 00:57:51.350
And right next to it was a
Dutch South African factory.

00:57:51.350 --> 00:57:53.610
And what's really
interesting is the protesters

00:57:53.610 --> 00:57:56.280
walked around the Dutch
South African factory

00:57:56.280 --> 00:57:58.470
and destroyed Aliko Dangote's factory.

00:57:58.470 --> 00:57:59.310
Why?

00:57:59.310 --> 00:58:02.370
Because the Dutch South African factory,

00:58:02.370 --> 00:58:03.640
they employed a lot of locals,

00:58:03.640 --> 00:58:06.920
also gave them shares from the company.

00:58:06.920 --> 00:58:08.910
It was perceived as a local project.

00:58:08.910 --> 00:58:13.910
So in some sense, if you
incorporate kind of local partners,

00:58:14.120 --> 00:58:16.043
it also mediates political risks.

00:58:17.350 --> 00:58:20.900
So let's now turn over to the lessons

00:58:20.900 --> 00:58:24.330
that we can draw from
these two case studies.

00:58:24.330 --> 00:58:26.460
So first of all I think the central lesson

00:58:26.460 --> 00:58:29.350
is that deal conditions matter
for development outcomes.

00:58:29.350 --> 00:58:31.330
And going back to this first question

00:58:31.330 --> 00:58:32.550
that we had in beginning,

00:58:32.550 --> 00:58:34.200
like is China new colonialist?

00:58:34.200 --> 00:58:37.310
Or can it sort of put its model in Africa

00:58:37.310 --> 00:58:39.990
and then now Africa is gonna rise,

00:58:39.990 --> 00:58:43.500
I really think that this
is more about African side,

00:58:43.500 --> 00:58:47.180
strategizing rather than the
Chinese dictating any model,

00:58:47.180 --> 00:58:51.860
and you see that in different
sort of policy environments.

00:58:51.860 --> 00:58:53.820
The Chinese are gonna act very differently

00:58:53.820 --> 00:58:57.030
as international actors are
gonna act differently as well.

00:58:57.030 --> 00:59:00.380
So I think it's more
sort of African agency

00:59:00.380 --> 00:59:02.330
that is going to determine whether

00:59:02.330 --> 00:59:04.810
this is a positive or a
negative China-Africa story.

00:59:04.810 --> 00:59:07.190
I also doubt that there's
one China-Africa story,

00:59:07.190 --> 00:59:09.710
because we have 54
different African countries,

00:59:09.710 --> 00:59:11.183
but very different policies.

00:59:12.140 --> 00:59:15.700
And the conventional wisdom
here is actually on these

00:59:15.700 --> 00:59:18.650
two conditions that African
countries can't set them

00:59:18.650 --> 00:59:21.340
because they have to be deal takers

00:59:21.340 --> 00:59:23.700
in order to attract any
kind of foreign capital.

00:59:23.700 --> 00:59:26.270
And this is very much this
Washington Consensus Narrative,

00:59:26.270 --> 00:59:27.870
the Poverty Trap Narrative,

00:59:27.870 --> 00:59:30.550
that the region historically
has not been able

00:59:30.550 --> 00:59:33.150
to attract significant
amounts of investment.

00:59:33.150 --> 00:59:35.010
So you have to make it as easy

00:59:35.010 --> 00:59:38.430
for foreign investors as
possible to kind of attract them.

00:59:38.430 --> 00:59:40.210
This is because Africa's
population is young

00:59:40.210 --> 00:59:42.700
and under educated, low
stocks of human capital

00:59:42.700 --> 00:59:45.100
poor infrastructure and political risk,

00:59:45.100 --> 00:59:48.550
sort of what Jeffrey Sachs
laid out in his piece.

00:59:48.550 --> 00:59:50.373
And even with China in the picture,

00:59:51.780 --> 00:59:53.730
the African countries
still have no exit options

00:59:53.730 --> 00:59:56.170
to the Chinese offer, right?

00:59:56.170 --> 01:00:00.230
So it's kind of this idea of
whatever the Chinese offering,

01:00:00.230 --> 01:00:01.440
you have to accept,

01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:03.680
because there's no one
else who will step in

01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:05.490
and build this for you.

01:00:05.490 --> 01:00:06.470
So as I said,

01:00:06.470 --> 01:00:10.110
I conducted 10 months of
field research in Africa,

01:00:10.110 --> 01:00:12.860
kind of to try to find evidence for this.

01:00:12.860 --> 01:00:15.330
And now based on the
evidence that I found,

01:00:15.330 --> 01:00:18.750
I highly doubt this entire narrative.

01:00:18.750 --> 01:00:21.180
And I say that paradoxically,

01:00:21.180 --> 01:00:23.380
I believe African countries actually

01:00:23.380 --> 01:00:26.550
have significant bargaining
power with China.

01:00:26.550 --> 01:00:29.790
And I think this is
fundamentally based on the idea

01:00:29.790 --> 01:00:32.111
that Africa doesn't just
have all these weaknesses,

01:00:32.111 --> 01:00:35.640
that the poverty trap
list here, but in fact,

01:00:35.640 --> 01:00:37.720
Africa is the region in the world

01:00:37.720 --> 01:00:40.730
with the most amount of natural resources.

01:00:40.730 --> 01:00:43.870
The cheapest labor in the
world and the cheapest land.

01:00:43.870 --> 01:00:46.460
And in contrast to the West,

01:00:46.460 --> 01:00:49.510
China has both willingness
and capacity right now

01:00:49.510 --> 01:00:51.360
at its developmental stage,

01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:55.020
to put its money into Africa
and to really get returns

01:00:55.020 --> 01:00:59.240
from these factors that look
very attractive and lucrative

01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:00.620
to China here.

01:01:00.620 --> 01:01:03.800
So completely, China has
massive capital surpluses

01:01:03.800 --> 01:01:07.230
as I said and it needs raw
material to fuel its growth.

01:01:07.230 --> 01:01:09.480
Africa is the last
region to industrialize.

01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:12.290
So as I said, I interviewed a
lot of Chinese manufacturers

01:01:12.290 --> 01:01:16.040
that are really excited
about the African markets,

01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:19.573
because it's so much cheaper
there to run a factory now.

01:01:20.710 --> 01:01:24.790
Africa also has export
deals with the UN, the US.

01:01:24.790 --> 01:01:27.210
So actually, when they
want to export goods,

01:01:27.210 --> 01:01:28.440
they don't have to pay any tariffs.

01:01:28.440 --> 01:01:31.070
So as a Chinese if you produce in Africa,

01:01:31.070 --> 01:01:34.790
it is cheaper for you
and in a lot of cases.

01:01:34.790 --> 01:01:35.780
What's also interesting,

01:01:35.780 --> 01:01:38.477
I want to focus data in
and I interviewed someone

01:01:38.477 --> 01:01:43.200
who is still in Nigeria and the
President said that in 2016,

01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:46.105
China increased its
environmental regulations

01:01:46.105 --> 01:01:48.010
in symmetric market.

01:01:48.010 --> 01:01:48.843
And in that year,

01:01:48.843 --> 01:01:52.590
you saw a lot of Chinese companies
that did not want to obey

01:01:52.590 --> 01:01:56.070
with these environmental
regulations to Africa because,

01:01:56.070 --> 01:01:58.380
for example Nigeria doesn't have these

01:01:58.380 --> 01:02:00.490
strict government regulations.

01:02:00.490 --> 01:02:02.810
And finally, Chinese
companies also seem to be

01:02:02.810 --> 01:02:04.860
less risk averse to political instability.

01:02:04.860 --> 01:02:07.380
So you also have a lot
of Chinese investments

01:02:07.380 --> 01:02:09.110
in South Sudan, for example,

01:02:09.110 --> 01:02:11.480
which is not politically very stable.

01:02:11.480 --> 01:02:14.290
So I think that Western investors
are much more sensitive,

01:02:14.290 --> 01:02:18.010
they also stay to these kind of political

01:02:18.010 --> 01:02:19.070
and safety concerns.

01:02:19.070 --> 01:02:20.390
They stay a lot of urban areas,

01:02:20.390 --> 01:02:23.970
where you see a lot of
Chinese in rural areas.

01:02:23.970 --> 01:02:26.440
And I think that what's
the most important is that

01:02:26.440 --> 01:02:28.930
certain concerns with Western investment

01:02:28.930 --> 01:02:30.600
that limit African bargaining power,

01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:33.150
are less alien with Chinese one.

01:02:33.150 --> 01:02:34.010
So first of all,

01:02:34.010 --> 01:02:36.710
you could argue that
because China is offering

01:02:36.710 --> 01:02:38.430
all these loans to Africa,

01:02:38.430 --> 01:02:42.283
it makes these African countries
very dependent on China.

01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:45.010
But actually Deborah Brautigam,

01:02:45.010 --> 01:02:46.810
who is one of the leading scholars here,

01:02:46.810 --> 01:02:49.560
she wrote a lot on this and saying,

01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:52.180
the magnitude of this
is really overstated.

01:02:52.180 --> 01:02:55.770
And then you see countries like
Ethiopia who have taken out

01:02:55.770 --> 01:02:58.460
much more debt with China
actually being more aggressive

01:02:58.460 --> 01:02:59.650
with China than others

01:02:59.650 --> 01:03:03.163
which are smaller debtors like Nigeria.

01:03:04.020 --> 01:03:07.250
Secondly, China is also really trying

01:03:07.250 --> 01:03:08.870
to compete with the West.

01:03:08.870 --> 01:03:10.870
And the number of allies matters.

01:03:10.870 --> 01:03:14.760
Also at the UN we see
that UN General Assembly,

01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:17.020
these African countries on certain things

01:03:17.020 --> 01:03:19.430
they vote with China.

01:03:19.430 --> 01:03:21.450
And if you're Ghana or if you're Nigeria,

01:03:21.450 --> 01:03:24.550
you have the same vote,
it's one country, one vote.

01:03:24.550 --> 01:03:27.550
So that's why China's interested
in having a relationship

01:03:27.550 --> 01:03:29.850
with all these countries
and economic relationship

01:03:29.850 --> 01:03:32.253
and there is the loan,
trade and investment.

01:03:33.100 --> 01:03:36.220
And I think this is very
important for the central point

01:03:36.220 --> 01:03:38.830
here that these African countries,

01:03:38.830 --> 01:03:41.700
there's less of a need for
intercontinental competition

01:03:41.700 --> 01:03:44.770
for Chinese investments
because it seems less rivalrous

01:03:44.770 --> 01:03:46.550
than what's coming from the West.

01:03:46.550 --> 01:03:51.080
And even if China's the
only sort of investor here,

01:03:51.080 --> 01:03:54.380
China oftentimes prefers
to be in your economy,

01:03:54.380 --> 01:03:55.530
than not be in your economy.

01:03:55.530 --> 01:03:59.083
Even if they have to
adapt slightly to policies

01:03:59.083 --> 01:04:01.480
that countries imposing
and you see this year,

01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:05.870
you see investment stocks from
the US where like you have

01:04:05.870 --> 01:04:09.250
maybe five countries where
the top receivers and the rest

01:04:09.250 --> 01:04:10.170
is getting very little.

01:04:10.170 --> 01:04:12.920
And there's a lot of competition
here for US investment.

01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:16.030
But when you look at Chinese
investment stocks in Africa,

01:04:16.030 --> 01:04:18.880
the first ones surely to get more,

01:04:18.880 --> 01:04:21.900
but then you have a much
more even distribution

01:04:21.900 --> 01:04:23.450
of those investment pies,

01:04:23.450 --> 01:04:25.220
and you have 51 African countries

01:04:25.220 --> 01:04:26.900
that actually receive an investment pie.

01:04:26.900 --> 01:04:30.400
And yes, that is dependent
on sort of China's political

01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:32.180
and economic considerations.

01:04:32.180 --> 01:04:34.690
But I run some regressions
and it is very independent

01:04:34.690 --> 01:04:36.860
of whether African countries

01:04:36.860 --> 01:04:40.740
are imposing local participation
requirements or not.

01:04:40.740 --> 01:04:42.520
And let's take one of
these investment pies.

01:04:42.520 --> 01:04:44.390
Let's say Zimbabwe.

01:04:44.390 --> 01:04:47.960
And let's see what a policy
shock does to these investments.

01:04:47.960 --> 01:04:51.750
So in 2008, Zimbabwe implemented this

01:04:51.750 --> 01:04:54.770
Indigenisation and
Economic Empowerment Act,

01:04:54.770 --> 01:04:57.970
where all companies inside Zimbabwe

01:04:57.970 --> 01:05:01.130
had to have 51% of local ownership.

01:05:01.130 --> 01:05:04.630
And when we look at US
investment flows here,

01:05:04.630 --> 01:05:06.370
investment stocks in Zimbabwe,

01:05:06.370 --> 01:05:08.750
you see that after 2006,

01:05:08.750 --> 01:05:10.040
they were not even counted anymore

01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:11.930
because they really decreased a lot.

01:05:11.930 --> 01:05:14.240
And I found a lot of qualitative evidence

01:05:15.400 --> 01:05:17.500
from Western companies here,

01:05:17.500 --> 01:05:20.497
complaining about 51%
local ownership all of that

01:05:20.497 --> 01:05:25.010
and it just made Zimbabwe
very, very uncompetitive

01:05:25.010 --> 01:05:27.350
compared to African countries.

01:05:27.350 --> 01:05:28.183
And of course,

01:05:28.183 --> 01:05:30.790
you also have the financial
crisis hit here in 2008.

01:05:30.790 --> 01:05:32.860
That also is part of the story.

01:05:32.860 --> 01:05:35.080
But when you look at Chinese
investment stocks here,

01:05:35.080 --> 01:05:38.550
they really don't seem
to be bothered by the 51%

01:05:38.550 --> 01:05:42.250
local ownership here where
you see starting in 2010,

01:05:42.250 --> 01:05:44.363
these stocks really skyrocket.

01:05:45.250 --> 01:05:48.900
So this is puzzling and then
when we look at Algeria,

01:05:48.900 --> 01:05:52.690
we have the exact same
policy change also in 2008,

01:05:52.690 --> 01:05:57.690
with 50% of local ownership
required with companies.

01:05:57.730 --> 01:06:01.930
And here you see, starting in 2007,

01:06:01.930 --> 01:06:04.880
when these were announced it really like

01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:08.020
the curve really gets much more flat

01:06:08.020 --> 01:06:09.610
versus Chinese investment stocks.

01:06:09.610 --> 01:06:10.910
They just you have that

01:06:10.910 --> 01:06:12.803
upward sloping trend line regardless.

01:06:13.690 --> 01:06:15.910
And I also conducted a lot of interviews

01:06:15.910 --> 01:06:19.177
with Chinese businesses
and Western businesses,

01:06:19.177 --> 01:06:21.630
try and get at these sensitivities,

01:06:21.630 --> 01:06:24.580
to local participation requirements.

01:06:24.580 --> 01:06:26.470
And really, across the board,

01:06:26.470 --> 01:06:28.420
when I asked the Chinese
they were just like,

01:06:28.420 --> 01:06:29.820
honestly, like as I said,

01:06:29.820 --> 01:06:32.130
this is China in the '70s and '80s.

01:06:32.130 --> 01:06:33.520
And it's great here,

01:06:33.520 --> 01:06:36.960
I would stay under any
kind of policy regulations.

01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:40.200
Versus when you ask a Western investor,

01:06:40.200 --> 01:06:43.750
they were like no, like
if I had to employ locals,

01:06:43.750 --> 01:06:45.150
I would think about it twice.

01:06:45.150 --> 01:06:48.113
And I found this quote
from Algeria as well.

01:06:49.510 --> 01:06:50.620
So the question is,

01:06:50.620 --> 01:06:53.940
why do some countries like Nigeria, Kenya,

01:06:53.940 --> 01:06:56.253
negotiate weaker deals
in the sense of like,

01:06:57.570 --> 01:07:00.860
diversification issues
and local participation,

01:07:00.860 --> 01:07:02.510
weaker deals with China than others

01:07:02.510 --> 01:07:04.450
like Ethiopia and Tanzania?

01:07:04.450 --> 01:07:07.000
And I think common explanations here are,

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.070
for example corruption
that countries know that

01:07:09.070 --> 01:07:12.010
they could be asking for more
from the Chinese investors,

01:07:12.010 --> 01:07:14.630
but they aren't because
politicians like to just pocket

01:07:14.630 --> 01:07:17.100
some money and let them
do whatever they want.

01:07:17.100 --> 01:07:20.240
Or another explanation is ideology

01:07:20.240 --> 01:07:23.260
so that they know they could
be imposing these restrictions

01:07:23.260 --> 01:07:25.290
and the Chinese would be doing it

01:07:25.290 --> 01:07:28.560
but let's just keep the economy open

01:07:28.560 --> 01:07:31.070
because we really support capitalism

01:07:31.070 --> 01:07:33.790
and let market forces do their job.

01:07:33.790 --> 01:07:37.370
Or capacity where the government
knows they could be asking

01:07:37.370 --> 01:07:41.110
for more but they don't have
trained or skilled negotiators

01:07:41.110 --> 01:07:45.570
that can face sort of
the Chinese negotiators

01:07:45.570 --> 01:07:47.610
that have more experience.

01:07:47.610 --> 01:07:49.930
But I would like to bring
up a new explanation here,

01:07:49.930 --> 01:07:52.780
which is the government's perceptions

01:07:52.780 --> 01:07:54.900
on their own bargaining power matter.

01:07:54.900 --> 01:07:57.410
And why could this be
one of the explanations?

01:07:57.410 --> 01:08:02.370
I mean, it isn't exactly
obvious that these economies

01:08:02.370 --> 01:08:03.690
do have bargaining power, right?

01:08:03.690 --> 01:08:06.420
Like we just talked
about all the weaknesses

01:08:06.420 --> 01:08:08.200
and how the Washington Consensus

01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:11.110
and the Poverty Trap
Narrative really suggests

01:08:11.110 --> 01:08:12.830
that these countries are negotiating

01:08:12.830 --> 01:08:15.030
from a position of weakness.

01:08:15.030 --> 01:08:18.820
So I conducted interviews,

01:08:18.820 --> 01:08:22.670
especially very, very
intensively in Nigeria,

01:08:22.670 --> 01:08:25.130
to understand how the Nigerian
government thinks about

01:08:25.130 --> 01:08:26.980
Chinese companies and
how Chinese companies

01:08:26.980 --> 01:08:30.120
think about the Nigerian
government in terms of kind of

01:08:30.120 --> 01:08:33.260
policy sensitivity and exit thresholds

01:08:33.260 --> 01:08:35.530
and of what would be the policies

01:08:35.530 --> 01:08:37.100
that would drive the Chinese out.

01:08:37.100 --> 01:08:40.040
And the Nigerian government I
interviewed national ministers

01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:43.880
who told me honestly, we have
no bargaining power here.

01:08:43.880 --> 01:08:45.280
The Chinese and the West,

01:08:45.280 --> 01:08:47.390
they're bringing all the money
and we have nothing to offer.

01:08:47.390 --> 01:08:51.460
So we kind of just have let
them do whatever they want to,

01:08:51.460 --> 01:08:53.310
versus with the Chinese companies,

01:08:53.310 --> 01:08:55.640
as I said, I got a lot of them just said,

01:08:55.640 --> 01:08:58.760
you know, I would do everything
to be able to stay here.

01:08:58.760 --> 01:09:01.090
And in other countries like Tanzania,

01:09:01.090 --> 01:09:04.218
there was much more of this awareness,

01:09:04.218 --> 01:09:05.510
this China really needs us.

01:09:05.510 --> 01:09:07.360
And then Ethiopia I've heard that a lot

01:09:07.360 --> 01:09:11.090
like we are really pulling
the Chinese in here right now

01:09:11.090 --> 01:09:13.090
because we have cheap labor
and we have cheap land.

01:09:13.090 --> 01:09:16.150
And this is exactly what China
is looking for right now.

01:09:16.150 --> 01:09:19.380
So what are the factors that
influence African governments'

01:09:19.380 --> 01:09:20.860
perceptions on bargaining power?

01:09:20.860 --> 01:09:24.500
And I tried to understand the
political economy behind this.

01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:25.333
So first of all,

01:09:25.333 --> 01:09:27.370
I think the historic
relationship to the West

01:09:27.370 --> 01:09:30.180
versus the East matters to where I said,

01:09:30.180 --> 01:09:33.160
Nigeria was a British
colony for a very long time.

01:09:33.160 --> 01:09:36.990
And we went through the
Washington Consensus and really

01:09:36.990 --> 01:09:41.020
adapted what Western
investors were telling Nigeria

01:09:41.020 --> 01:09:42.070
at that time,

01:09:42.070 --> 01:09:44.660
versus Ethiopia had never been colonized.

01:09:44.660 --> 01:09:45.500
Tanzania also has

01:09:45.500 --> 01:09:47.750
a very long historical
relationship with China.

01:09:47.750 --> 01:09:50.790
They've looked very much
more towards the East

01:09:50.790 --> 01:09:52.123
also during the Cold War.

01:09:52.963 --> 01:09:55.100
There is also federalism
and ministry constellation

01:09:55.100 --> 01:09:58.750
where in Nigeria, a lot
of different states,

01:09:58.750 --> 01:10:00.290
they actually compete for investments.

01:10:00.290 --> 01:10:02.500
So they're not likely
to share information,

01:10:02.500 --> 01:10:04.520
how much Chinese investment
is actually coming in.

01:10:04.520 --> 01:10:07.730
And a lot of them really
underestimated Nigeria's position

01:10:07.730 --> 01:10:10.750
and attractiveness to China.

01:10:10.750 --> 01:10:12.460
And it's the same with
ministry constellation,

01:10:12.460 --> 01:10:14.580
where in Nigeria you
have a lot of ministries

01:10:14.580 --> 01:10:16.020
sort of competing for these deals,

01:10:16.020 --> 01:10:18.140
and there's not one collaborative effort

01:10:18.140 --> 01:10:19.900
versus when you have one sort of

01:10:19.900 --> 01:10:21.613
very centralized government.

01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:24.400
That government has all the information

01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:26.380
on sort of what investment comes in.

01:10:26.380 --> 01:10:27.920
And it's also overtime learning

01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:30.590
if you have one party in
power for a long time,

01:10:30.590 --> 01:10:33.380
they might have tested out
kind of what can we asked

01:10:33.380 --> 01:10:35.560
for also more informal deals.

01:10:35.560 --> 01:10:38.180
And then finally individual
agency also matters,

01:10:38.180 --> 01:10:40.920
where I've just met people,
for example in Tanzania,

01:10:40.920 --> 01:10:43.640
someone in a very senior
position in the ministry.

01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:45.640
He was educated in Japan,

01:10:45.640 --> 01:10:48.030
and just really studied industrial policy

01:10:48.030 --> 01:10:48.863
through and through.

01:10:48.863 --> 01:10:51.740
And he just knew, he was very confident

01:10:51.740 --> 01:10:55.740
that China was going
to obey by these rules

01:10:55.740 --> 01:10:56.717
if Tanzania asked for them.

01:10:56.717 --> 01:11:00.470
And Tanzania also has
similar policies to Ethiopia.

01:11:00.470 --> 01:11:03.260
So what are some policy implications here?

01:11:03.260 --> 01:11:04.280
I just think incentives

01:11:04.280 --> 01:11:06.290
are more effective than requirements.

01:11:06.290 --> 01:11:09.680
Mostly because when you look
at these different graphs

01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:11.780
from the West and China,

01:11:11.780 --> 01:11:14.130
you're trying to attract
two different kinds

01:11:14.130 --> 01:11:16.220
and types of investors.

01:11:16.220 --> 01:11:21.220
So if you offer like a menu
like Ethiopia has here,

01:11:21.400 --> 01:11:22.830
different types of investors

01:11:22.830 --> 01:11:25.090
can pick whatever they like the most.

01:11:25.090 --> 01:11:28.930
So if I care more about low taxes,

01:11:28.930 --> 01:11:32.870
maybe I'm more willing to have
a joint venture and so forth.

01:11:32.870 --> 01:11:36.070
So you can kind of mix
up different policies

01:11:36.070 --> 01:11:39.300
and offer a different menu to
different types of investors

01:11:39.300 --> 01:11:41.520
that can pick whatever they wanna do.

01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:43.270
I think because these countries also have

01:11:43.270 --> 01:11:44.630
weak formal policies,

01:11:44.630 --> 01:11:46.890
it leaves room for a
case-by-case negotiations

01:11:46.890 --> 01:11:50.870
as we see, for example,
with these industrial parks

01:11:50.870 --> 01:11:51.720
that I talked about.

01:11:51.720 --> 01:11:53.350
The hidden industrial
parks of the villages

01:11:53.350 --> 01:11:55.930
that kind of set up a deal
that work for all sides.

01:11:55.930 --> 01:11:58.920
And you should also account
for enter and exit thresholds

01:11:58.920 --> 01:12:00.590
where I think the decision of companies

01:12:00.590 --> 01:12:03.350
to enter your country, are probably,

01:12:03.350 --> 01:12:05.860
they're more sensitive to kind
of your policy environment

01:12:05.860 --> 01:12:07.540
rather than if you're
already in the country.

01:12:07.540 --> 01:12:10.410
And then certainly, you
have to pay higher taxes.

01:12:10.410 --> 01:12:11.820
So your decision to exit

01:12:11.820 --> 01:12:15.220
because you already set up
kind of a factory, et cetera.

01:12:15.220 --> 01:12:18.380
It's gonna be less sensitive
than if you still need to put

01:12:18.380 --> 01:12:20.880
in all the capital in the beginning.

01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:23.510
So what are some
expectations for the future?

01:12:23.510 --> 01:12:25.730
So I think there's
certain things to consider

01:12:25.730 --> 01:12:27.570
on the Chinese side.

01:12:27.570 --> 01:12:31.650
Which is can China maintain its
growth but I also heard that

01:12:31.650 --> 01:12:33.110
because China's growth is slowing

01:12:33.110 --> 01:12:37.200
now all these Chinese
manufacturers are moving to Africa

01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:38.500
in search for new opportunities,

01:12:38.500 --> 01:12:39.750
and they feel like the African region

01:12:39.750 --> 01:12:41.080
is the next one to industrialize.

01:12:41.080 --> 01:12:45.870
So it's kind of, literature
here is not clear whether

01:12:45.870 --> 01:12:47.010
China slowing its growth,

01:12:47.010 --> 01:12:49.300
is actually good or bad
for the African region.

01:12:49.300 --> 01:12:51.980
How its rivalry will play out with the US.

01:12:51.980 --> 01:12:54.130
And what about automation
and the flying geese.

01:12:54.130 --> 01:12:56.140
So I think that's something
we should be concerned about

01:12:56.140 --> 01:13:00.390
that if labor is being
replaced with machines,

01:13:00.390 --> 01:13:04.800
maybe the cheap labor in
Africa is gonna be less needed.

01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:06.300
So factors on the African side,

01:13:06.300 --> 01:13:08.240
I think the biggest question is,

01:13:08.240 --> 01:13:10.500
can countries start to
use their bargaining power

01:13:10.500 --> 01:13:12.570
and negotiate stronger deals?

01:13:12.570 --> 01:13:15.940
And just coming up with a strategy,

01:13:15.940 --> 01:13:17.250
I think here is essential,

01:13:17.250 --> 01:13:19.820
rather than just leaving
the entire economy open

01:13:19.820 --> 01:13:21.930
and letting investors
do whatever they want.

01:13:21.930 --> 01:13:25.470
Sort of what China did when
it was poor and agricultural.

01:13:25.470 --> 01:13:27.430
It did come up with a strategy

01:13:27.430 --> 01:13:29.770
that propelled up the economy.

01:13:29.770 --> 01:13:32.490
And I think this is
interesting on debts and trade,

01:13:32.490 --> 01:13:33.323
because as I said,

01:13:33.323 --> 01:13:37.600
at the former China-Africa
cooperation in 2008,

01:13:37.600 --> 01:13:39.950
African countries already complained

01:13:39.950 --> 01:13:41.480
that there was an in trade imbalance

01:13:41.480 --> 01:13:43.170
between China and Africa and that China

01:13:43.170 --> 01:13:45.910
should also import more
from the African region.

01:13:45.910 --> 01:13:48.850
So it seems like around debts and trade,

01:13:48.850 --> 01:13:51.270
there is more of an awareness

01:13:51.270 --> 01:13:53.830
that this relationship
should be more equal.

01:13:53.830 --> 01:13:57.320
And I hope that investments also are going

01:13:57.320 --> 01:13:59.250
into the right direction.

01:13:59.250 --> 01:14:00.860
So just to close,

01:14:00.860 --> 01:14:02.930
I brought you this comparison here again,

01:14:02.930 --> 01:14:07.930
which shows very nicely,
China's economic growth miracle.

01:14:08.200 --> 01:14:11.730
And what I find really interesting
here is that in the '80s,

01:14:11.730 --> 01:14:15.330
it was really the West investing in China

01:14:15.330 --> 01:14:16.820
and doing a lot of trade with China,

01:14:16.820 --> 01:14:19.460
but we still don't call
it the West in China,

01:14:19.460 --> 01:14:22.050
how we call China in Africa today.

01:14:22.050 --> 01:14:24.630
And this is because China

01:14:24.630 --> 01:14:27.610
took some lessons from
other countries in the past,

01:14:27.610 --> 01:14:30.110
like some of the structural adjustment,

01:14:30.110 --> 01:14:32.640
it's liked and implemented others,

01:14:32.640 --> 01:14:34.010
it came up with the zones model,

01:14:34.010 --> 01:14:36.410
which was the state capitalism.

01:14:36.410 --> 01:14:37.940
And I think similarly,

01:14:37.940 --> 01:14:40.720
the African region also
can just copy and paste

01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:43.750
one model from China now or from the West,

01:14:43.750 --> 01:14:47.670
but it should strategize
and see sort of what fits to

01:14:47.670 --> 01:14:50.220
local realities and the
common narrative here

01:14:50.220 --> 01:14:51.710
has always been that

01:14:51.710 --> 01:14:54.790
the African region can't
afford to strategize

01:14:54.790 --> 01:14:57.720
because otherwise you can't really attract

01:14:57.720 --> 01:14:59.440
foreign investment to grow.

01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:02.640
But I think because Africa
is the region that has

01:15:02.640 --> 01:15:05.430
the highest stocks of raw
material in the world,

01:15:05.430 --> 01:15:07.770
the cheapest labor right
now and the cheapest land,

01:15:07.770 --> 01:15:09.480
I do think that there's some leverage here

01:15:09.480 --> 01:15:10.490
for the African region.

01:15:10.490 --> 01:15:11.960
And hopefully in the future,

01:15:11.960 --> 01:15:13.560
we can recolor this map

01:15:13.560 --> 01:15:18.120
and the African region
can catch up with China.

01:15:18.120 --> 01:15:19.364
Thank you.

01:15:19.364 --> 01:15:22.364
(audience clapping)

01:15:30.079 --> 01:15:32.496

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.939
Prof: Okay,
I left you guys thinking about

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:13.040
inductors last time,
so I should start there.

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.539
An inductor is very different
from the resistor when you start

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:22.363
doing circuit theory,
because when you have a

00:00:22.363 --> 00:00:28.470
resistor and you connect some
voltage to it,

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:35.330
the current is determined by
this equation.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.310
This is what I call an
algebraic equation.

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:40.070
It's an equation in algebra,
one unknown.

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:45.187
You solve for it by dividing
and you get I at time

00:00:45.187 --> 00:00:50.670
t is V at time
t divided by R.

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.829
And you can make the network
more complicated,

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:57.059
put a few more resistors,
put a few more there,

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.429
a few more here,
resistors within resistors.

00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:02.853
It doesn't matter,
because we can always in the

00:01:02.853 --> 00:01:06.122
end combine the ones in series
then lump them with the stuff in

00:01:06.122 --> 00:01:08.786
parallel,
till the whole thing to the

00:01:08.786 --> 00:01:12.209
right of this is one single
effective resistor.

00:01:12.209 --> 00:01:15.295
Then you find the current
coming out of the sources as

00:01:15.295 --> 00:01:17.099
V divided by that guy.
 

00:01:17.099 --> 00:01:20.323
Then every time it comes to a
branch, we sort of know how to

00:01:20.323 --> 00:01:20.980
divide it.
 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.879
So resistor circuits are very
easy.

00:01:23.879 --> 00:01:26.735
But now when you bring
inductors, things are different,

00:01:26.735 --> 00:01:29.750
so I'm just going to tell you a
little more about them.

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.000
Here is an inductor.
 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.550
That's the symbol for an
inductor.

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:39.470
It's got some inductance
L measured in henries.

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.459
And the implication of that is
the following:

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:46.060
if you have a current going
through this inductor,

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.745
there is going to be
necessarily a voltage with this

00:01:50.745 --> 00:01:54.420
polarity if the current is
increasing.

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.690
And the voltage you need is
LdI/dt.

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:00.700
This is the bottom line.
 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.954
Even if you skip all the other
stuff about conservative forces,

00:02:05.954 --> 00:02:10.616
this, that, this is something
you need to know how to do

00:02:10.616 --> 00:02:11.718
problems.
 

00:02:11.718 --> 00:02:15.155
The difference you notice is
that the relation between

00:02:15.155 --> 00:02:18.265
voltage and current is not an
algebraic equation,

00:02:18.265 --> 00:02:20.340
but a differential equation.
 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.960
This is called a differential
equation.

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.317
Now you don't have to worry,
because I will tell you how to

00:02:26.317 --> 00:02:29.732
solve it, because I don't know
if it's a prerequisite or not

00:02:29.732 --> 00:02:30.889
for this course.
 

00:02:30.889 --> 00:02:35.006
I once had a kid in summer
school who when I started using

00:02:35.006 --> 00:02:38.184
partial derivatives,
got very upset and said,

00:02:38.184 --> 00:02:40.639
"It's not a prerequisite.
 

00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:43.169
Why are you using partial
derivatives?"

00:02:43.169 --> 00:02:45.901
So I told him,
"When you come to class,

00:02:45.901 --> 00:02:49.270
there's always a danger you'll
learn something new.

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:50.840
You just have to learn to live
with that."

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.169
So I'm not going to leave you
in the cold.

00:02:53.169 --> 00:02:57.578
If I do something you've not
done, I will tell you how to do

00:02:57.578 --> 00:03:01.090
it, but I cannot avoid using
certain notions.

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:02.987
So this one,
even though it's called a

00:03:02.987 --> 00:03:05.962
differential equation and so on,
if V is a constant,

00:03:05.962 --> 00:03:07.810
we can easily find the
integral.

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.830
It will be V over
L times t.

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:14.810
Okay, but now we're going to be
interested in cases where

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.258
V is not simply constant;
it could be varying with time

00:03:19.258 --> 00:03:21.169
in an arbitrary way.
 

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:23.914
So you take this guy,
the first thing you notice is

00:03:23.914 --> 00:03:26.991
that the relation between
current and voltage is given by

00:03:26.991 --> 00:03:27.870
derivatives.
 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.223
Second thing is,
when a current flows through a

00:03:31.223 --> 00:03:35.522
resistor, whatever energy you
provide is gone in the form of

00:03:35.522 --> 00:03:36.180
heat.
 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.370
It has dissipated.
 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.758
The light bulb glows and that's
the end.

00:03:39.758 --> 00:03:44.008
With an inductor,
when you drive a current,

00:03:44.008 --> 00:03:47.122
you are building a magnetic
field inside the inductor and

00:03:47.122 --> 00:03:50.180
there's an energy associated
with the magnetic field.

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:55.650
And that stored energy will be
given back to you later on.

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.008
So it's like a capacitor.
 

00:03:58.008 --> 00:04:00.151
It takes a lot of work to
charge a capacitor,

00:04:00.151 --> 00:04:02.973
because you've got to take
charges from this plate and keep

00:04:02.973 --> 00:04:04.580
on piling them in that plate.
 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:07.461
It's a lot of work,
but then if you connect that to

00:04:07.461 --> 00:04:10.287
a bulb and you squeeze the
trigger in your camera,

00:04:10.287 --> 00:04:12.938
this charge is giving you the
energy back.

00:04:12.938 --> 00:04:18.187
So the inductor and capacitor
are different from the resistor

00:04:18.187 --> 00:04:21.891
in two ways: one is,
the voltage across the

00:04:21.891 --> 00:04:26.740
capacitor is the charge on the
capacitor divided by C,

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.766
which if youlike is the
integral of the current up to

00:04:29.766 --> 00:04:31.629
that time divided by C.
 

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:34.680
Again, calculus comes in.
 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.644
So these are the two
differences, the relation

00:04:36.644 --> 00:04:39.266
between current and voltage and
voltage is differentiating or

00:04:39.266 --> 00:04:41.982
integrating,
and these are energy storing

00:04:41.982 --> 00:04:44.800
circuit elements compared to
this one,

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.680
where energy is dissipated.
 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.336
So let's start with a simple
problem where I have a voltage

00:04:52.336 --> 00:04:53.060
source.
 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.470
I'm going to take a fixed
voltage, V_0.

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:59.312
There is a switch,
there is a resistor R,

00:04:59.312 --> 00:05:02.420
and there is this inductor
L.

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:06.761
I'm going to assume the current
is flowing this way,

00:05:06.761 --> 00:05:09.060
in which case--I'm sorry.
 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.310
You know, this picture's wrong.
 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:17.410
What's wrong with this picture?
 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:19.259
What is wrong?
 

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:21.290
Student:  The switch is
open.

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:23.110
Prof: The switch is
open, okay.

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:25.500
That's what's wrong,
so nothing is flowing yet.

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:29.610
But when I close the switch,
then it's fine.

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:32.339
Now it's flowing.
 

00:05:32.339 --> 00:05:34.329
And the question is,
what does it do?

00:05:34.329 --> 00:05:36.490
How does it flow?
 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:39.720
After all, the inductor is a
resistance free wire,

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:43.029
so you may think current =
V_0/R will

00:05:43.029 --> 00:05:46.317
start flowing immediately,
but that's wrong,

00:05:46.317 --> 00:05:49.879
because if such a current were
flowing,

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:52.670
there'll be an energy
Â½LI^(2) with that

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:53.529
current in it.
 

00:05:53.529 --> 00:05:56.911
And that energy cannot come
from 0 to all of that in no

00:05:56.911 --> 00:05:57.350
time.
 

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:59.360
There's no way to do that.
 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.430
Or if you like,
if the current really grows

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:05.867
rapidly or instantaneously from
0 to some value,

00:06:05.867 --> 00:06:09.670
that's a current,
dI/dt is infinite here.

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:12.490
dI/dt is infinite,
LdI/dt is infinite.

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:15.362
There's an infinite voltage
needed somewhere in the circuit

00:06:15.362 --> 00:06:17.790
and we don't have it,
so that would not happen.

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:22.584
So current will have to be
continuous, start from 0 and it

00:06:22.584 --> 00:06:25.110
will have to start climbing.
 

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:28.476
The minute the current starts
climbing up it starts flowing

00:06:28.476 --> 00:06:29.579
through this guy.
 

00:06:29.579 --> 00:06:34.291
There is the resistance times
current voltage drop across

00:06:34.291 --> 00:06:34.879
this.
 

00:06:34.879 --> 00:06:38.367
Therefore the amount of voltage
available to drive current

00:06:38.367 --> 00:06:42.160
through this one or to increase
the current through this one is

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:45.464
reduced from V_0
to V_0 -

00:06:45.464 --> 00:06:46.259
RI.
 

00:06:46.259 --> 00:06:49.589
That = LdI/dt.
 

00:06:49.589 --> 00:06:52.230
So you can see,
as the current increases,

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:54.430
the motivation to increase the
current decreases,

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:58.672
because this resistor starts
swallowing up more and more of

00:06:58.672 --> 00:06:59.769
this voltage.
 

00:06:59.769 --> 00:07:03.009
So the growth in current will
be very, very slow,

00:07:03.009 --> 00:07:07.125
and we expect that after a very
long time, it will settle down

00:07:07.125 --> 00:07:08.339
to some value.
 

00:07:08.339 --> 00:07:09.379
What is that value?
 

00:07:09.379 --> 00:07:11.927
We can find that value by
saying, "Wait until the

00:07:11.927 --> 00:07:13.660
current has stopped
growing."

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:16.536
That means dI/dt =0,
that current will be

00:07:16.536 --> 00:07:20.024
V_0/R
and I'm going to give it the

00:07:20.024 --> 00:07:22.350
name
I_infinity,

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:25.959
because it will turn out that
you will reach the value only

00:07:25.959 --> 00:07:27.329
after infinite time.
 

00:07:27.329 --> 00:07:30.245
But you can get very,
very close to that by waiting

00:07:30.245 --> 00:07:33.802
some reasonable amount of time,
and part of what we want to do

00:07:33.802 --> 00:07:35.610
is, how long should I wait?
 

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:38.470
Suppose I'm settling for 90
percent of maximum.

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:39.480
When does that happen?
 

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:42.129
Is it after 1 second or 10
seconds or 10 hours?

00:07:42.129 --> 00:07:44.089
What's going to decide that?
 

00:07:44.089 --> 00:07:47.283
Well, once you have the right
equations, you can figure

00:07:47.283 --> 00:07:48.290
everything out.
 

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:49.819
So we're going to do that.
 

00:07:49.819 --> 00:07:54.279
So basically we are going to
solve the equation

00:07:54.279 --> 00:07:55.829
LdI/dt.
 

00:07:55.829 --> 00:07:58.560
So let me show you one more
time how it is done,

00:07:58.560 --> 00:07:59.490
this equation.
 

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:01.009
You should know how to write it.
 

00:08:01.009 --> 00:08:04.509
Start anywhere you like,
go round this guy.

00:08:04.509 --> 00:08:07.689
You gain voltage
V_0.

00:08:07.689 --> 00:08:11.913
Then go around this guy,
you drop by an amount

00:08:11.913 --> 00:08:13.040
RI.
 

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:14.600
You drop by an amount RI.
 

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:17.449
And here you jump from this end
to this end.

00:08:17.449 --> 00:08:20.000
Remember, you never go into the
inductor.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
That's a bad zone.
 

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.778
That's a zone where the
potential is not even defined,

00:08:24.778 --> 00:08:27.362
but I've told you multiple
times that even though there are

00:08:27.362 --> 00:08:29.500
non conservative things going on
inside this,

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:32.452
once you come outside,
you just find a regular

00:08:32.452 --> 00:08:35.928
electrostatic potential
difference = LdI/dt.

00:08:35.928 --> 00:08:38.734
So you drop again,
and you come back to where you

00:08:38.734 --> 00:08:41.153
start,
the whole thing should add up

00:08:41.153 --> 00:08:46.048
to 0,
which means the equation is

00:08:46.048 --> 00:08:51.639
LdI/dt RI =
V_0.

00:08:51.639 --> 00:08:54.908
That's what we want to solve.
 

00:08:54.908 --> 00:08:57.587
So when you have this thing,
as I told you,

00:08:57.587 --> 00:09:01.350
solving differential equations
is a matter of guess work.

00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:02.830
There is no algorithm.
 

00:09:02.830 --> 00:09:05.980
You rely on what you've seen
before and you guess the answer.

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:08.900
You put some free parameters,
you fiddle with them till

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:09.928
everything works.
 

00:09:09.928 --> 00:09:13.409
And in this kind of problem,
we can make everything work.

00:09:13.409 --> 00:09:14.860
Some problems we cannot solve.
 

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:17.820
We can write the equations but
we cannot solve them.

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:21.091
This is something you're not
used to when you take an

00:09:21.091 --> 00:09:23.230
elementary course like this one.
 

00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:26.269
But there are situations,
for example,

00:09:26.269 --> 00:09:29.418
you know inside the proton
there are these quarks,

00:09:29.418 --> 00:09:32.932
and the quarks interact with
each other with entities called

00:09:32.932 --> 00:09:33.470
gluons.
 

00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:36.730
They're called gluons because
they glue the quarks and form

00:09:36.730 --> 00:09:38.250
the protons and neutrons.
 

00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:43.100
We know the equations governing
the behavior of the gluons.

00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:45.399
We cannot solve them.
 

00:09:45.399 --> 00:09:46.029
It's really strange.
 

00:09:46.029 --> 00:09:48.038
You have an equation but you
cannot solve it.

00:09:48.038 --> 00:09:50.634
It's completely possible,
because certain

00:09:50.634 --> 00:09:54.590
equations--every equation has a
solution, but it does not mean

00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:57.120
you can write it down
analytically.

00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:59.567
So quite often,
one may be on top of the right

00:09:59.567 --> 00:10:03.048
answer, but one may not know how
to solve it, so one doesn't even

00:10:03.048 --> 00:10:04.788
know if the theory is right.
 

00:10:04.788 --> 00:10:07.275
So suppose this was the
equation you got,

00:10:07.275 --> 00:10:09.080
but you could not solve it.
 

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:10.450
It happens to be the right
equation.

00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:13.961
You don't know what the answer
looks like, you can never be

00:10:13.961 --> 00:10:16.019
sure this is the right equation.
 

00:10:16.019 --> 00:10:18.703
Similarly when
Mr. Schrï¿½dinger invented his

00:10:18.703 --> 00:10:21.634
quantum mechanics,
he wrote an equation that will

00:10:21.634 --> 00:10:24.379
tell you the energy levels of
hydrogen.

00:10:24.379 --> 00:10:27.048
But luckily,
he was able to solve it.

00:10:27.048 --> 00:10:29.457
By solving it,
he was able to show that his

00:10:29.457 --> 00:10:33.128
equation gives the energy levels
iand the spectra you expect from

00:10:33.128 --> 00:10:34.389
the hydrogen atom.
 

00:10:34.389 --> 00:10:37.227
So you have to remember that
not every interesting equation

00:10:37.227 --> 00:10:39.831
can be solved,
and I gave you the equation for

00:10:39.831 --> 00:10:44.087
these gluons,
which we can write down but

00:10:44.087 --> 00:10:45.850
cannot solve.
 

00:10:45.850 --> 00:10:48.558
There is no function whose
derivative we cannot take.

00:10:48.558 --> 00:10:50.808
There are lots of functions
whose integrals we cannot do.

00:10:50.808 --> 00:10:53.870
That's simply asymmetry between
those two.

00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:58.977
Here's a very simple function:
e^(âx2)dx from 0

00:10:58.977 --> 00:11:02.182
to 19, or some fixed number,
0 to some

00:11:02.182 --> 00:11:04.519
x_max.
 

00:11:04.519 --> 00:11:05.649
It has a definite value.
 

00:11:05.649 --> 00:11:09.144
It's area under the graph,
but no one knows how to write a

00:11:09.144 --> 00:11:12.269
formula for this in terms of
x_max,

00:11:12.269 --> 00:11:14.110
where it's in closed form.
 

00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:18.340
But anyway, this guy we can
trample to death as follows.

00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:21.044
First we say at very,
very long times,

00:11:21.044 --> 00:11:22.946
the current,
I told you, is

00:11:22.946 --> 00:11:24.919
V_0/R.
 

00:11:24.919 --> 00:11:27.889
That's when dI/dt is 0.
 

00:11:27.889 --> 00:11:32.753
So we're going to write the
actual current in our problem as

00:11:32.753 --> 00:11:37.038
the current at infinity some
difference I twiddle.

00:11:37.038 --> 00:11:39.928
Standard thing,
you take out the part you know

00:11:39.928 --> 00:11:41.918
and solve for the rest of it.
 

00:11:41.918 --> 00:11:46.269
So let's take that assumed form
and put it into the differential

00:11:46.269 --> 00:11:47.029
equation.
 

00:11:47.029 --> 00:11:49.740
So when I do LdI/dt,
this is a number,

00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:51.279
V over R.
 

00:11:51.279 --> 00:11:53.320
It has no d by dt.
 

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:58.693
So dI/dt becomes
dIË/dt R

00:11:58.693 --> 00:12:02.383
times IË R
times

00:12:02.383 --> 00:12:08.179
I_infinity =
V_0.

00:12:08.179 --> 00:12:09.740
Now you can see why we did that.
 

00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:14.548
We did that because now these
two guys cancel and you get

00:12:14.548 --> 00:12:17.210
LdI/dt  RI = 0.
 

00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:28.326
That means dIË/dt
is âR/L times

00:12:28.326 --> 00:12:30.509
I.
 

00:12:30.509 --> 00:12:33.410
So we are saying,
get me a function whose time

00:12:33.410 --> 00:12:36.506
derivative looks like the
function itself up to a

00:12:36.506 --> 00:12:38.433
constant,
and that's something we know

00:12:38.433 --> 00:12:40.940
from high school,
is an exponential function.

00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:45.320
So IË
looks like some constant,

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:48.580
I_0e^(-Rt/L).
 

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:52.207
You can take the derivative of
this guy and out will come

00:12:52.207 --> 00:12:54.798
-R/L times the function
itself.

00:12:54.798 --> 00:12:58.940
And IË_0
is completely arbitrary.

00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:01.730
It's not determined by this
equation.

00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:03.480
There's another useful property
to know.

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:05.450
This is a linear equation.
 

00:13:05.450 --> 00:13:09.129
It means if you multiply both
sides by 19, you get another

00:13:09.129 --> 00:13:12.100
solution which is 19 times the
old solution.

00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:15.316
So the solution's overall scale
is not determined by the

00:13:15.316 --> 00:13:15.960
equation.
 

00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:17.703
If I give you one solution,
you can multiply it by any

00:13:17.703 --> 00:13:19.397
number you like,
it's also a solution,

00:13:19.397 --> 00:13:21.330
because if you multiply by a
number,

00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:23.950
say 9, the 9 goes into the
derivative,

00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:24.970
9 comes here.
 

00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:27.793
You can see 9 times IË
satisfies the same

00:13:27.793 --> 00:13:28.379
equation.
 

00:13:28.379 --> 00:13:30.649
So we don't know this number
just from the equation,

00:13:30.649 --> 00:13:34.379
but we go back to what we know,
which is I of t,

00:13:34.379 --> 00:13:40.009
is I_infinity,
which is V_0/R

00:13:40.009 --> 00:13:44.960
 IË_0
e^(âRt/L).

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:50.000
But I know that at t =
0, this guy should vanish.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.032
t = 0,
this guy should vanish,

00:13:52.032 --> 00:13:55.419
because there was no current
when I just threw the switch.

00:13:55.419 --> 00:13:58.009
So that tells me that equals 0.
 

00:13:58.009 --> 00:14:01.759
That tells me
IË_0 =

00:14:01.759 --> 00:14:06.668
-V_0/R and we
get our final result,

00:14:06.668 --> 00:14:16.557
which is I of t =
V_0/R times 1 -

00:14:16.557 --> 00:14:19.538
e^(-Rt/L).
 

00:14:19.538 --> 00:14:22.995
So at this level,
you are really doing physics

00:14:22.995 --> 00:14:25.070
the way we like to do it.
 

00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:28.270
We like to study things,
write down some equations and

00:14:28.270 --> 00:14:29.600
solve the equations.
 

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:34.370
Then we get a very precise
prediction on what will happen.

00:14:34.370 --> 00:14:36.985
Because now we don't have to
guess when the current will come

00:14:36.985 --> 00:14:38.600
to 90 percent of its maximum
value.

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:41.859
We can pick any number you
like, because we can now plot

00:14:41.859 --> 00:14:42.629
this graph.
 

00:14:42.629 --> 00:14:46.269
And let's plot this graph,
I(t) versus t.

00:14:46.269 --> 00:14:49.629
At t = 0,
e^(-0) is 1.

00:14:49.629 --> 00:14:51.889
You get 1 - 1, you get nothing.
 

00:14:51.889 --> 00:14:54.796
At t = infinity,
t to the minus infinity

00:14:54.796 --> 00:14:55.179
is 0.
 

00:14:55.179 --> 00:14:56.480
Yes?
 

00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:58.835
Student:  Over on the
right where it says IË

00:14:58.835 --> 00:15:01.429
sub twiddle = negative
V_0 over R,

00:15:01.429 --> 00:15:04.210
should that be 0?
 

00:15:04.210 --> 00:15:05.179
Prof: This one?
 

00:15:05.179 --> 00:15:07.320
Yeah, right. Thank you.
 

00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:12.259
Okay, so now this exponential
has a full strength of 1 at time

00:15:12.259 --> 00:15:13.149
equals 0.
 

00:15:13.149 --> 00:15:15.320
Goes to 0 at time equals
infinity.

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:19.486
Therefore it takes away
exponentially small stuff at

00:15:19.486 --> 00:15:21.038
very large times.
 

00:15:21.038 --> 00:15:24.594
And if you want to know roughly
how long should I wait,

00:15:24.594 --> 00:15:27.293
the answer is,
the time you should wait is

00:15:27.293 --> 00:15:29.399
roughly of order L/R.
 

00:15:29.399 --> 00:15:35.591
Because you can write this as
e^(-t)/Ï,

00:15:35.591 --> 00:15:39.129
where Ï is L/R.
 

00:15:39.129 --> 00:15:42.067
Whenever we have an
exponential, it will always be e

00:15:42.067 --> 00:15:45.754
to the minus a physical quantity
divided by some number that sets

00:15:45.754 --> 00:15:48.059
the scale for the physical
quantity.

00:15:48.059 --> 00:15:49.799
Exponentials fall exponentially.
 

00:15:49.799 --> 00:15:50.679
We know that.
 

00:15:50.679 --> 00:15:52.048
But how long should I wait?
 

00:15:52.048 --> 00:15:55.480
Well, if you wait t =
Ï seconds,

00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:59.225
then it will be 1/e,
which is roughly 1 over third

00:15:59.225 --> 00:16:02.903
of the starting value and 1
minus that will be roughly 2

00:16:02.903 --> 00:16:04.509
thirds of its value.
 

00:16:04.509 --> 00:16:10.409
If you wait t = 3Ï,
e^(-3) is 1 over 20,

00:16:10.409 --> 00:16:13.928
then you'll be what,
95 percent.

00:16:13.928 --> 00:16:21.350
So you can calculate everything
you need in this simple problem.

00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:23.509
So now let's come to the same
problem.

00:16:23.509 --> 00:16:28.240
The switch has been closed for
a long time and the current has

00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:29.250
stabilized.
 

00:16:29.250 --> 00:16:30.529
So here is the switch.
 

00:16:30.529 --> 00:16:32.100
It has been closed.
 

00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:34.649
That's my V_0,
that's R.

00:16:34.649 --> 00:16:37.417
And the current,
you remember,

00:16:37.417 --> 00:16:40.090
is V_0/R.
 

00:16:40.090 --> 00:16:44.580
This is L.
 

00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:46.960
So now we want to do something
else.

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:54.509
Now I want to open that switch.
 

00:16:54.509 --> 00:17:00.429
So what do you think will
happen if you open that switch?

00:17:00.429 --> 00:17:01.460
Yes?
 

00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:03.100
Student:  The inductor
will resist the changing

00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:03.408
current.
 

00:17:03.408 --> 00:17:05.009
Prof: But how can it
resist?

00:17:05.009 --> 00:17:08.788
Student:  By inducing
the magnetic field.

00:17:08.788 --> 00:17:11.548
Prof: It can do what it
wants, but how does it drive a

00:17:11.548 --> 00:17:13.160
current through the open
circuit?

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:15.318
Student:  From energy
stored in the magnetic field.

00:17:15.318 --> 00:17:17.898
Prof: But in what manner
will the current flow,

00:17:17.898 --> 00:17:19.700
given that I've broken the
circuit?

00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:22.500
Student:  In the
direction--

00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:24.259
Prof: No,
but how will it manage to go

00:17:24.259 --> 00:17:24.618
around?
 

00:17:24.618 --> 00:17:26.980
It's like removing the bridge,
right?

00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:28.180
How will it go around?
 

00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:30.757
I agree with everything you
said, but how will it make the

00:17:30.757 --> 00:17:31.210
circuit?
 

00:17:31.210 --> 00:17:32.269
Yes?
 

00:17:32.269 --> 00:17:33.842
Student:  There'll be a
higher concentration of charges

00:17:33.842 --> 00:17:34.588
on one side than the other.
 

00:17:34.588 --> 00:17:38.000
Prof: Yes,
but how will you really get rid

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.269
of the current in a circuit that
seems open?

00:17:41.269 --> 00:17:44.609
Have you ever done this?
 

00:17:44.609 --> 00:17:47.430
Okay, that's just fine.
 

00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:50.751
But we know it has to get rid
of that current,

00:17:50.751 --> 00:17:54.369
because otherwise,
what happened to the energy?

00:17:54.369 --> 00:17:55.990
It has to go through.
 

00:17:55.990 --> 00:17:58.856
So you know what,
you guys don't know what will

00:17:58.856 --> 00:18:00.789
happen if I pull that switch.
 

00:18:00.789 --> 00:18:01.568
Yes?
 

00:18:01.568 --> 00:18:04.808
Student:  Is the current
an electric field?

00:18:04.808 --> 00:18:08.518
The change in the magnetic
field will create an electric

00:18:08.518 --> 00:18:11.618
field which doesn't need the
closed circuit.

00:18:11.618 --> 00:18:13.385
Prof: Right,
no I agree, it will have an

00:18:13.385 --> 00:18:14.038
electric field.
 

00:18:14.038 --> 00:18:18.626
But how will the electrons flow
when the wire has been

00:18:18.626 --> 00:18:21.829
interrupted, is all I'm asking
you?

00:18:21.829 --> 00:18:23.278
Yes?
 

00:18:23.278 --> 00:18:24.140
Student:  Will the
current oscillate,

00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:24.539
go back and forth?
 

00:18:24.539 --> 00:18:26.670
Prof: No.
 

00:18:26.670 --> 00:18:27.740
Yes?
 

00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:28.970
Student:  You will have
a static discharge.

00:18:28.970 --> 00:18:29.759
Prof: You will have a
discharge.

00:18:29.759 --> 00:18:31.880
You will have an arc.
 

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:36.487
You will have a flash,
and that's when you'll hear a

00:18:36.487 --> 00:18:39.920
zip, and then it will jump this
gap.

00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:43.166
So whenever you remove the
switch, you have to be careful

00:18:43.166 --> 00:18:45.720
that there is not stored energy
somewhere.

00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:47.454
You might think,
"Hey, I am pulling the

00:18:47.454 --> 00:18:49.068
plug on--"
well, I won't say who.

00:18:49.068 --> 00:18:53.420
You're pulling the plug,
okay, and what can it do to me?

00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:56.259
Well, it can zap you,
because this is a very

00:18:56.259 --> 00:18:58.569
dangerous place to pull the
plug.

00:18:58.569 --> 00:19:00.819
So you know what people do?
 

00:19:00.819 --> 00:19:02.220
They have another resistor.
 

00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:04.538
Let's call this guy
R_1.

00:19:04.538 --> 00:19:09.457
This is R_2
and R_2 is a

00:19:09.457 --> 00:19:12.650
huge number, 10,000 ohms let's
say.

00:19:12.650 --> 00:19:15.402
So most of the time,
R_2 doesn't do

00:19:15.402 --> 00:19:17.932
anything,
because when the current comes

00:19:17.932 --> 00:19:20.777
here in any situation,
it looks at the inductor and

00:19:20.777 --> 00:19:22.450
looks at 10,000 ohms and it
says,

00:19:22.450 --> 00:19:23.568
"I'm going this way."
 

00:19:23.568 --> 00:19:28.354
So primarily,
it will all go there,

00:19:28.354 --> 00:19:29.338
okay?
 

00:19:29.338 --> 00:19:33.262
In the end, when the switch has
been closed for a very long time

00:19:33.262 --> 00:19:36.772
in our old experiment,
when the current is stabilized,

00:19:36.772 --> 00:19:38.980
you remember LdI/dt 0
here.

00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:40.950
So there's 0 volts between
these two.

00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:42.990
That's the same 0 volt across
R_2.

00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:44.740
No current will flow in
R_2.

00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:47.308
Everything will flow through
L.

00:19:47.308 --> 00:19:49.944
That current in fact will be
V_0 over

00:19:49.944 --> 00:19:52.829
R, because this guy has
been cut out of the loop.

00:19:52.829 --> 00:19:54.308
This is how it's going.
 

00:19:54.308 --> 00:19:59.141
But now if you throw the switch
open, you have given it a path

00:19:59.141 --> 00:20:00.328
to discharge.
 

00:20:00.328 --> 00:20:05.240
So the inductor will discharge
through the resistor.

00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:07.588
The current will continue to
flow in this direction.

00:20:07.588 --> 00:20:10.308
Of course, it cannot flow
forever, because the resistor

00:20:10.308 --> 00:20:13.078
will burn up the energy,
but you're giving it a path.

00:20:13.078 --> 00:20:15.450
You're avoiding--in a way,
if you like,

00:20:15.450 --> 00:20:18.818
this is also a path with very,
very high resistance.

00:20:18.818 --> 00:20:21.490
The air is a path with very
high resistance.

00:20:21.490 --> 00:20:24.190
That means by and large,
there are no free carriers in

00:20:24.190 --> 00:20:24.700
the air.
 

00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:27.450
But if the two tips get really
charged, just like you said,

00:20:27.450 --> 00:20:29.680
there'll be an emf that will
pile up charges.

00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:31.689
They're jumping,
they're waiting to jump the

00:20:31.689 --> 00:20:31.970
gap.
 

00:20:31.970 --> 00:20:35.240
Eventually they'll polarize
air, which is electrically

00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:36.970
neutral, into and - parts.
 

00:20:36.970 --> 00:20:39.210
Then the - will go one way,
the will go the other way.

00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:43.029
You'll recognize that as a
discharge.

00:20:43.029 --> 00:20:45.851
But you don't have to worry
about that now,

00:20:45.851 --> 00:20:49.680
because R_2
will take up your current.

00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:54.542
So now the equation we write is
LdI/dt  RI = 0

00:20:54.542 --> 00:20:58.993
because if you start anywhere
and you go around a loop,

00:20:58.993 --> 00:21:01.880
you have no change in anything.
 

00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:05.009
There's no voltage.
 

00:21:05.009 --> 00:21:09.414
And the answer to this one,
R_2,

00:21:09.414 --> 00:21:13.452
there I =
I_0e to the

00:21:13.452 --> 00:21:17.950
âR_2/L
times t.

00:21:17.950 --> 00:21:22.220
So now the current will decay
exponentially.

00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:25.306
Again, with the time constant,
R_2 over

00:21:25.306 --> 00:21:27.501
L,
which is the 1 over the time

00:21:27.501 --> 00:21:29.740
constant,
or the time constant is

00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:32.308
L over
R_2.

00:21:32.308 --> 00:21:34.695
So you put L in henries,
R in ohms,

00:21:34.695 --> 00:21:35.838
you'll get some time.
 

00:21:35.838 --> 00:21:39.059
That will give you an idea of
how many times that time you

00:21:39.059 --> 00:21:42.450
have to wait before the inductor
is completely discharged.

00:21:42.450 --> 00:21:44.769
Well, it's never going to be
fully discharged.

00:21:44.769 --> 00:21:46.647
It's going to take forever,
but if you say,

00:21:46.647 --> 00:21:49.598
"Look, 1 thousandth of the
original current is safe enough.

00:21:49.598 --> 00:21:51.500
How long do I have to
wait?"

00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:55.440
you put .001 here and see what
time you get.

00:21:55.440 --> 00:22:01.842
So you want
e^(ât/Ï) to be

00:22:01.842 --> 00:22:02.910
.001.
 

00:22:02.910 --> 00:22:08.833
So every big inductor you have
in a circuit you will find has

00:22:08.833 --> 00:22:15.348
got a resistor in parallel with
it to take up the energy it has.

00:22:15.348 --> 00:22:18.890
So let's do a little energy
calculation.

00:22:18.890 --> 00:22:24.005
The energy calculation will be,
I had energy in the inductor in

00:22:24.005 --> 00:22:26.561
the beginning,
which is Â½

00:22:26.561 --> 00:22:29.119
LI_0 ^(2).
 

00:22:29.119 --> 00:22:30.200
What happened to it?
 

00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:31.598
Well, we know what happened.
 

00:22:31.598 --> 00:22:34.807
There's a current in the
circuit, and when the current is

00:22:34.807 --> 00:22:37.785
flowing in the circuit,
it is dissipating heat in the

00:22:37.785 --> 00:22:38.529
resistor.
 

00:22:38.529 --> 00:22:42.574
Therefore the power in the
resistor will be

00:22:42.574 --> 00:22:45.269
I^(2)R_2.
 

00:22:45.269 --> 00:22:49.123
 I^(2) is
I_0^(2) due to the

00:22:49.123 --> 00:22:52.750
minus twice R_2t/L
times another

00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:54.640
R_2.
 

00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:58.916
Now we integrate this power
from 0 to infinity,

00:22:58.916 --> 00:23:04.588
you will get I_0
^(2)R_2.

00:23:04.588 --> 00:23:07.928
The integral of e to the
minus something is e to

00:23:07.928 --> 00:23:10.500
the minus that divided by that
infinity to 0.

00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:15.315
I can promise you that what you
will get will be

00:23:15.315 --> 00:23:17.980
L/2R_2.
 

00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:26.608
It will give you then 1 over
2LI_0^(2).

00:23:26.608 --> 00:23:31.095
So this is not a surprise,
that the stored energy in the

00:23:31.095 --> 00:23:33.950
inductor is driving your
current.

00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:36.805
So if you want,
one way to store energy,

00:23:36.805 --> 00:23:40.247
it's a capacitor,
you charge it and it discharge

00:23:40.247 --> 00:23:43.029
when you want the current to
flow.

00:23:43.029 --> 00:23:46.522
Or you can have an inductor,
in which a current has been set

00:23:46.522 --> 00:23:46.818
up.
 

00:23:46.818 --> 00:23:50.084
Then when the power shuts off
in your house and somebody

00:23:50.084 --> 00:23:52.694
throws the switch,
that inductor can keep the

00:23:52.694 --> 00:23:55.068
light bulb burning,
in fact forever.

00:23:55.068 --> 00:23:57.150
It will be infinite time before
the bulb shuts down,

00:23:57.150 --> 00:23:59.808
but you won't be able to see
anything after a while,

00:23:59.808 --> 00:24:05.230
because this graph is
exponentially falling.

00:24:05.230 --> 00:24:09.630
This is a very simple problem
where we can do the math and we

00:24:09.630 --> 00:24:12.049
can understand what it's doing.
 

00:24:12.049 --> 00:24:13.019
Yes?
 

00:24:13.019 --> 00:24:17.269
Student:  The graph,
what is that triangle thing?

00:24:17.269 --> 00:24:19.079
Prof: This one here?
 

00:24:19.079 --> 00:24:20.500
This is called Ï.
 

00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:22.338
You mean that symbol?
 

00:24:22.338 --> 00:24:26.325
Tau is a unit of time whose
numerical value is

00:24:26.325 --> 00:24:31.637
R_2/L and we
can write I as I_0

00:24:31.637 --> 00:24:34.029
e^(ât/Ï).
 

00:24:34.029 --> 00:24:35.910
We always like to write it in
this form,

00:24:35.910 --> 00:24:40.718
so that if Ï = 100 seconds,
you will have to make many

00:24:40.718 --> 00:24:43.868
multiples of 100 seconds before
the current is negligible.

00:24:43.868 --> 00:24:46.130
Student:  What are the
units on the axis?

00:24:46.130 --> 00:24:47.848
Prof: Oh,
in this graph here?

00:24:47.848 --> 00:24:52.230
This is time and this is the
current in the loop.

00:24:52.230 --> 00:25:01.400
It starts out at some initial
value.

00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:13.924
Okay, now I'm going to do the
next slightly more complicated

00:25:13.924 --> 00:25:21.778
circuit, and that is an LC
circuit.

00:25:21.778 --> 00:25:26.430
If you have a circuit like
that, it won't do anything.

00:25:26.430 --> 00:25:28.858
You can take these guys,
hook them up and wait all day.

00:25:28.858 --> 00:25:32.740
Nothing will happen because
it's got no energy.

00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:33.660
Why should it do anything?
 

00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:35.318
It's just going to sit there.
 

00:25:35.318 --> 00:25:40.690
But if you've charged up your
capacitor like this,

00:25:40.690 --> 00:25:43.430
and there's an open switch that
you then closed,

00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:47.703
then those charges are going to
leave and find their way around

00:25:47.703 --> 00:25:51.564
the other side and neutralize
them and the capacitor will

00:25:51.564 --> 00:25:52.529
discharge.
 

00:25:52.529 --> 00:25:57.545
But you know that once it
discharges, it's not the end of

00:25:57.545 --> 00:25:58.619
the story.
 

00:25:58.619 --> 00:25:59.440
So why is that?
 

00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:04.319
Why doesn't it stop when the
capacitor is discharged?

00:26:04.319 --> 00:26:05.130
Yes?
 

00:26:05.130 --> 00:26:06.986
Student:  It's kind of
like the inductor has momentum

00:26:06.986 --> 00:26:07.710
and it keeps pulling.
 

00:26:07.710 --> 00:26:11.236
Prof: The inductor would
have had a current by then,

00:26:11.236 --> 00:26:14.579
so the inductor is not going to
suddenly stop having its

00:26:14.579 --> 00:26:15.308
current.
 

00:26:15.308 --> 00:26:17.960
So it's going to keep driving
more current for a while,

00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:22.378
until the capacitor's charged
up the opposite way to an extent

00:26:22.378 --> 00:26:25.240
that this fights that one,
that voltage,

00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:27.289
and then it will go the other
way.

00:26:27.289 --> 00:26:31.140
So it will go back and forth.
 

00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:33.698
So let's write down the
equation that tells you how it

00:26:33.698 --> 00:26:34.759
goes back and forth.
 

00:26:34.759 --> 00:26:36.390
So in other words,
you should draw pictures.

00:26:36.390 --> 00:26:39.460
Textbooks have nice pictures
and I won't even try it.

00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:41.991
In the beginning,
it may look like--I'm sorry,

00:26:41.991 --> 00:26:43.737
in my example,
in the beginning,

00:26:43.737 --> 00:26:47.170
there's an electric field here,
nothing in the capacitor.

00:26:47.170 --> 00:26:49.230
After a quarter cycle,
there's nothing here,

00:26:49.230 --> 00:26:51.288
there's a magnetic field in the
inductor.

00:26:51.288 --> 00:26:53.566
Another quarter cycle,
it's back here,

00:26:53.566 --> 00:26:57.318
but with the opposite polarity,
and it goes back and forth.

00:26:57.318 --> 00:27:05.539
So we can get all that,
by writing the equation

00:27:05.539 --> 00:27:11.078
LdI/dt Q/C = 0.
 

00:27:11.078 --> 00:27:15.769
So let's write everything in
terms of Q.

00:27:15.769 --> 00:27:21.523
Then dQ/dt is I,
because as the current flows

00:27:21.523 --> 00:27:24.700
this way, it builds up charge.
 

00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:26.118
That's my convention.
 

00:27:26.118 --> 00:27:36.490
So I can write it as
Ld^(2)Q/dt^(2) (1/C)Q =

00:27:36.490 --> 00:27:37.318
0.
 

00:27:37.318 --> 00:27:40.478
Now we have seen exactly this
equation before,

00:27:40.478 --> 00:27:41.038
right?
 

00:27:41.038 --> 00:27:50.000
We saw the equation for a mass
coupled to a spring the equation

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:54.480
md^(2)x/dt^(2) kx = 0.
 

00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:56.140
Now we know what it does.
 

00:27:56.140 --> 00:28:01.288
We know it oscillates back and
forth.

00:28:01.288 --> 00:28:06.949
And L--this is an SAT
question--L is to

00:28:06.949 --> 00:28:11.519
m what 1/C is to
k.

00:28:11.519 --> 00:28:14.884
It's very useful to bear in
mind this analogy,

00:28:14.884 --> 00:28:18.922
because mathematically,
this equation and this equation

00:28:18.922 --> 00:28:21.538
have exactly the same solution.
 

00:28:21.538 --> 00:28:23.750
It's no more difficult to solve
this one than that one.

00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:25.099
This may involve electric
charges;

00:28:25.099 --> 00:28:26.220
that may involve masses.
 

00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:27.710
You don't care.
 

00:28:27.710 --> 00:28:31.671
So mathematically,
here's an equation:

00:28:31.671 --> 00:28:38.414
cow times d^(2) dog over
dt^(2) let's say elephant

00:28:38.414 --> 00:28:42.240
times dog = 0,
where dog is a function of

00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:44.788
time, has exactly the same
solution.

00:28:44.788 --> 00:28:47.976
What does it matter what you
call the unknown variables,

00:28:47.976 --> 00:28:48.440
right?
 

00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:51.597
But you've got to tell me that
cow and elephant are time

00:28:51.597 --> 00:28:55.160
independent and dog is the only
thing that depends on time,

00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:57.108
because otherwise the equation
is not the same.

00:28:57.108 --> 00:29:00.269
So here m and k don't change,
L and C don't change.

00:29:00.269 --> 00:29:01.970
So what's the answer to this
one?

00:29:01.970 --> 00:29:04.220
Once again, it's the
differential equation.

00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:08.747
You write dQ/dt squared
is â (1/LC) Q and

00:29:08.747 --> 00:29:12.310
you're asking yourself,
give me a function which,

00:29:12.310 --> 00:29:16.910
when I differentiate twice,
looks like itself.

00:29:16.910 --> 00:29:18.608
There's always the exponential.
 

00:29:18.608 --> 00:29:21.218
There's also sines and the
cosines and you can take any

00:29:21.218 --> 00:29:22.328
combination you like.
 

00:29:22.328 --> 00:29:31.893
And the one acceptable solution
is some constant A times

00:29:31.893 --> 00:29:40.839
cosine square root of 1 over
LC t. Is that right?

00:29:40.839 --> 00:29:41.298
Yes.
 

00:29:41.298 --> 00:29:43.358
If you take two derivatives of
Q,

00:29:43.358 --> 00:29:46.180
you'll pull one over root
LC each time,

00:29:46.180 --> 00:29:49.990
then you'll get a - sine when
cosine becomes - sine and one

00:29:49.990 --> 00:29:53.210
more derivative will bring it
back to - cosine.

00:29:53.210 --> 00:29:56.114
So this is called the
frequency, which is

00:29:56.114 --> 00:29:57.640
1/âLC.
 

00:29:57.640 --> 00:30:02.950
That's the analog of square
root of k over m.

00:30:02.950 --> 00:30:04.338
Anyway, this will oscillate.
 

00:30:04.338 --> 00:30:08.788
It's a mechanical analog--it's
the electrical analog of the

00:30:08.788 --> 00:30:10.400
mechanical problem.
 

00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:13.133
So I don't want to do too much
of this, because I think you

00:30:13.133 --> 00:30:15.205
should be quite familiar with
this, at least,

00:30:15.205 --> 00:30:16.950
the oscillatory behavior of
this.

00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:18.588
And the analogy is perfect.
 

00:30:18.588 --> 00:30:22.259
For example,
to say that I pulled the mass

00:30:22.259 --> 00:30:27.095
by 1 meter is to say that
x was given a non-zero

00:30:27.095 --> 00:30:30.048
value and dx/dt was 0.
 

00:30:30.048 --> 00:30:32.910
Analogous thing here will be
Q was given a non-zero

00:30:32.910 --> 00:30:35.368
value and dQ/dt which is
I, is 0.

00:30:35.368 --> 00:30:38.191
That means the capacitor was
charged, the inductor was not

00:30:38.191 --> 00:30:39.329
carrying any current.
 

00:30:39.329 --> 00:30:40.210
Then I let it go.
 

00:30:40.210 --> 00:30:41.140
What happens?
 

00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:43.190
The problems are identical.
 

00:30:43.190 --> 00:30:44.480
Yes?
 

00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:48.758
Student:  When you solve
the differential equation,

00:30:48.758 --> 00:30:50.858
why did you omit the sine?
 

00:30:50.858 --> 00:30:52.599
Prof: Yes,
I should explain to you.

00:30:52.599 --> 00:30:55.009
That's an important point.
 

00:30:55.009 --> 00:30:58.250
Q(t) can be one number,
cosine

00:30:58.250 --> 00:31:00.950
Ï_0t.
 

00:31:00.950 --> 00:31:04.448
Ï_0 is
this guy another number sine

00:31:04.448 --> 00:31:06.289
Ï_0t.
 

00:31:06.289 --> 00:31:08.650
And both are acceptable.
 

00:31:08.650 --> 00:31:11.410
And the property of this
differential equation is,

00:31:11.410 --> 00:31:13.865
if I have one answer,
cos Ït, and

00:31:13.865 --> 00:31:17.317
another possible answer,
sine Ït, then any

00:31:17.317 --> 00:31:21.470
constant times cos any constant
times sine is also a solution.

00:31:21.470 --> 00:31:23.028
You can verify that.
 

00:31:23.028 --> 00:31:25.460
If you have one solution,
Q_1,

00:31:25.460 --> 00:31:27.440
a second solution,
Q_2,

00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:29.684
you can add the two equations
and you can show

00:31:29.684 --> 00:31:32.730
Q_1 Q_2
obeys the same equation.

00:31:32.730 --> 00:31:36.480
Not only that,
suppose there's one problem you

00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:38.630
solve,
dQ_1/dt

00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:42.058
squared is -Ï
on R squared

00:31:42.058 --> 00:31:43.740
Q_1.
 

00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:48.827
There is some function of time
and here's another function of

00:31:48.827 --> 00:31:51.710
time, obeying the same equation.
 

00:31:51.710 --> 00:31:55.116
Now you can multiply this by a
number A and you can

00:31:55.116 --> 00:31:58.224
multiply this by a number
B, take the A

00:31:58.224 --> 00:32:01.673
inside the derivative,
B inside the derivative

00:32:01.673 --> 00:32:03.078
and add the two sides.
 

00:32:03.078 --> 00:32:05.673
On the left hand side you will
find the second derivative of

00:32:05.673 --> 00:32:07.390
AQ_1
BQ_2.

00:32:07.390 --> 00:32:08.502
Right hand side,
you will find

00:32:08.502 --> 00:32:10.537
Ï_0^(2)
times AQ_1

00:32:10.537 --> 00:32:11.420
BQ_2.
 

00:32:11.420 --> 00:32:14.508
That means AQ_1
BQ_2 obeys this

00:32:14.508 --> 00:32:16.078
same differential equation.
 

00:32:16.078 --> 00:32:19.720
This is called superposing two
solutions.

00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:21.584
You've got one solution,
another one,

00:32:21.584 --> 00:32:23.500
you can multiply one by a
constant.

00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:26.298
It's very important it's a
constant, because that's what

00:32:26.298 --> 00:32:28.588
will let you take it inside the
derivative.

00:32:28.588 --> 00:32:31.390
Therefore the correct answer
here is really

00:32:31.390 --> 00:32:35.190
AcosÏd
BsinÏt and you can

00:32:35.190 --> 00:32:36.732
ask,
why did you write

00:32:36.732 --> 00:32:39.009
AcosÏ
_0t?

00:32:39.009 --> 00:32:40.868
First of all,
that's not a good solution.

00:32:40.868 --> 00:32:45.078
I can put a Î¦
there which is arbitrary.

00:32:45.078 --> 00:32:49.038
And it's not hard to show--let
me call that C if you

00:32:49.038 --> 00:32:50.200
like, C.
 

00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:55.154
This can be written as
CcosÏ

00:32:55.154 --> 00:32:58.380
_0t - Î¦.
 

00:32:58.380 --> 00:33:00.733
In other words,
it's possible to take either a

00:33:00.733 --> 00:33:02.670
solution with a cosine and a
sine,

00:33:02.670 --> 00:33:06.432
with no extra phases inside,
to another one with one

00:33:06.432 --> 00:33:08.348
amplitude and one phase.
 

00:33:08.348 --> 00:33:11.380
The phase is the delay in the
cosine.

00:33:11.380 --> 00:33:15.180
Anybody here has trouble,
who does not know the details,

00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:18.358
I'll be happy to explain why
that's correct.

00:33:18.358 --> 00:33:20.460
If you don't know,
you should tell me now.

00:33:20.460 --> 00:33:25.410
You can check that if you take
this thing,

00:33:25.410 --> 00:33:30.200
make a right angled triangle
with A,

00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:34.680
B and C and an
angle Î¦ here,

00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:39.625
then A can be written as
CcosÎ¦ and

00:33:39.625 --> 00:33:44.230
B can be written as
CsinÎ¦,

00:33:44.230 --> 00:33:46.363
and that just happens to be
cosÏt -

00:33:46.363 --> 00:33:50.048
Î¦,
this one, some trigonometry.

00:33:50.048 --> 00:33:53.865
So the differential equation,
with the second order in time,

00:33:53.865 --> 00:33:56.970
will always have two unknown
parameters in it.

00:33:56.970 --> 00:34:00.055
You can choose them to be these
numbers A and B,

00:34:00.055 --> 00:34:02.230
or this number C and
Î¦.

00:34:02.230 --> 00:34:04.710
And the equation won't tell you
what they are,

00:34:04.710 --> 00:34:07.955
because once you tell me
there's a mass coupled to a

00:34:07.955 --> 00:34:10.382
spring and I say,
"Okay, this is the spring

00:34:10.382 --> 00:34:11.650
constant this is the mass?"
 

00:34:11.650 --> 00:34:13.775
and I ask you,
"Where is the mass right

00:34:13.775 --> 00:34:14.369
now?"
 

00:34:14.369 --> 00:34:15.070
I don't know.
 

00:34:15.070 --> 00:34:18.130
It depends on when you started
it and how you released it.

00:34:18.130 --> 00:34:20.929
So I need to know what's called
initial conditions,

00:34:20.929 --> 00:34:24.340
which is the value of Q
or the value of x at the

00:34:24.340 --> 00:34:27.641
initial time and the value of
the velocity or the current at

00:34:27.641 --> 00:34:28.760
an initial time.
 

00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:32.550
With those two pieces of
information, I can solve for

00:34:32.550 --> 00:34:34.300
A and B.
 

00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:38.469
This I think you should know,
this kind of stuff you should

00:34:38.469 --> 00:34:41.559
know, so I won't say too much
about that.

00:34:41.559 --> 00:34:46.480
All right, so now we do another
problem.

00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:52.880
We put an alternating voltage
on these guys.

00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:57.987
So this is V_0
cosÏt and this

00:34:57.987 --> 00:35:01.070
is C and this is
L.

00:35:01.070 --> 00:35:05.079
Now we ask, what's the current?
 

00:35:05.079 --> 00:35:10.518
This omega is not the natural
frequency of oscillation.

00:35:10.518 --> 00:35:14.579
It is some externally given
omega, like 60 hertz from your

00:35:14.579 --> 00:35:16.929
power supply,
from your socket.

00:35:16.929 --> 00:35:20.050
So that's driving the circuit
and you can ask,

00:35:20.050 --> 00:35:21.369
what happens now?
 

00:35:21.369 --> 00:35:25.349
The answer will be,
you write the same equation.

00:35:25.349 --> 00:35:34.894
You can write Ld^(2)Q/dt^(2)
 (1/C)Q =

00:35:34.894 --> 00:35:41.789
V_0cos
Ït.

00:35:41.789 --> 00:35:43.550
Now what are you going to do?
 

00:35:43.550 --> 00:35:46.840
You have to again guess the
solution.

00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:50.170
So I want a function,
Q of t,

00:35:50.170 --> 00:35:53.731
so that when I take two
derivatives and add it to some

00:35:53.731 --> 00:35:56.289
multiple of itself,
I get something,

00:35:56.289 --> 00:35:58.179
something times the cosine.
 

00:35:58.179 --> 00:36:01.809
So what should that function
look like?

00:36:01.809 --> 00:36:02.929
Yes?
 

00:36:02.929 --> 00:36:07.739
Student: 
&gt;

00:36:07.739 --> 00:36:09.940
Prof: No,
no, what function Q

00:36:09.940 --> 00:36:12.768
of t do you think will
satisfy this equation?

00:36:12.768 --> 00:36:15.797
I'm asking for a function of
time which, when I put into

00:36:15.797 --> 00:36:18.440
this, has some chance of obeying
the equation.

00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:23.480
What's the functional form?
 

00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:24.539
Yes?
 

00:36:24.539 --> 00:36:26.030
Student:  Cosine times
some constant.

00:36:26.030 --> 00:36:26.760
Prof: Right.
 

00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:30.101
In other words,
I can take it to be some

00:36:30.101 --> 00:36:33.786
constant, C times
cosÏt,

00:36:33.786 --> 00:36:34.730
period.
 

00:36:34.730 --> 00:36:37.829
Not even times Î¦.
 

00:36:37.829 --> 00:36:41.610
Take this one, see what happens.
 

00:36:41.610 --> 00:36:46.226
Now when you take one
derivative, you get

00:36:46.226 --> 00:36:50.730
-ÏLCcos
Ït.

00:36:50.730 --> 00:36:53.365
When you take another
derivative, you get

00:36:53.365 --> 00:36:55.739
âÏ
^(2)L ^(2)--

00:36:55.739 --> 00:36:59.960
I'm sorry, this becomes sine
times cosÏt,

00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:04.030
and this one is just oh my
god--this is my nightmare.

00:37:04.030 --> 00:37:06.559
You can see the nightmare now?
 

00:37:06.559 --> 00:37:08.969
How many people see the
nightmare?

00:37:08.969 --> 00:37:09.880
Yes?
 

00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:10.768
Student:  Constant
C.

00:37:10.768 --> 00:37:13.757
Prof: Yes,
so I picked that C to be

00:37:13.757 --> 00:37:15.500
the same as this C.
 

00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:22.480
So we'll put a hat on this guy
so we can tell them about.

00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:27.728
So CË/C times
CË is

00:37:27.728 --> 00:37:32.739
V_0
cosÏt.

00:37:32.739 --> 00:37:35.880
And what this tells you is,
if you take two

00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:39.170
derivatives--I'm sorry,
this is so sloppy.

00:37:39.170 --> 00:37:47.467
If you take two derivatives
here, you will get

00:37:47.467 --> 00:37:51.340
Ï^(2).
 

00:37:51.340 --> 00:37:59.300
cosÏ be also be
with the - sign.

00:37:59.300 --> 00:38:01.329
Q/C.
 

00:38:01.329 --> 00:38:02.800
Okay.
 

00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:03.820
You guys buy that?
 

00:38:03.820 --> 00:38:07.929
There is no L^(2),
just an L.

00:38:07.929 --> 00:38:14.239
That = V_0
cosÏt.

00:38:14.239 --> 00:38:14.570
Right?
 

00:38:14.570 --> 00:38:18.614
Every derivative brings an
Ï and there's a net -

00:38:18.614 --> 00:38:19.150
sign.
 

00:38:19.150 --> 00:38:22.914
So you find out that your
guess, CËc

00:38:22.914 --> 00:38:27.621
osÏt is going to
work, provided this equation is

00:38:27.621 --> 00:38:28.719
satisfied.
 

00:38:28.719 --> 00:38:30.530
And the cosÏt can
be canceled.

00:38:30.530 --> 00:38:33.219
That's the whole point of doing
this thing.

00:38:33.219 --> 00:38:40.351
So then you get CË
= V_0 -

00:38:40.351 --> 00:38:47.481
V_0 divided by
Ï^(2)L â

00:38:47.481 --> 00:38:49.159
1/C.
 

00:38:49.159 --> 00:38:53.648
Or if you like,
-V_0/L divided

00:38:53.648 --> 00:38:58.530
by Ï^(2) -
Ï_0^(2).

00:38:58.530 --> 00:39:01.780
Don't worry about the numerator;
look at the denominator.

00:39:01.780 --> 00:39:05.951
The denominator says that if
your driving frequency is equal

00:39:05.951 --> 00:39:09.768
to the resonant frequency,
CË blows up.

00:39:09.768 --> 00:39:12.150
That means when a system has
got a resonance--yes?

00:39:12.150 --> 00:39:15.869
Student:  Where did the
Ï^(2) come from?

00:39:15.869 --> 00:39:19.065
Prof: I took two
derivatives--oh,

00:39:19.065 --> 00:39:19.639
here.
 

00:39:19.639 --> 00:39:21.000
Oh, I'm sorry.
 

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:23.420
Yes, thank you.
 

00:39:23.420 --> 00:39:26.813
You know, it's good to do these
things slowly and not rely on

00:39:26.813 --> 00:39:28.340
what you heard somewhere.
 

00:39:28.340 --> 00:39:29.739
So let me do it for you again.
 

00:39:29.739 --> 00:39:30.739
Sorry about that.
 

00:39:30.739 --> 00:39:32.599
So this time I take two
derivatives.

00:39:32.599 --> 00:39:34.530
Each one brings an
Ï.

00:39:34.530 --> 00:39:37.398
There is an L,
and the - sine comes because

00:39:37.398 --> 00:39:39.309
the cosine becomes - sine.
 

00:39:39.309 --> 00:39:41.809
Differentiate one more,
you get - the cosine.

00:39:41.809 --> 00:39:43.139
This guy is nothing.
 

00:39:43.139 --> 00:39:47.001
It just says "divide my by
C"

00:39:47.001 --> 00:39:49.320
and that's equal to that.
 

00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:52.800
And then I wrote 1/LC is
Ï_0^(2).

00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:53.889
Thank you very much.
 

00:39:53.889 --> 00:39:55.380
Okay?
 

00:39:55.380 --> 00:39:57.400
I was really hung up on the
final result,

00:39:57.400 --> 00:39:59.585
which tells you,
you'd better not drive this at

00:39:59.585 --> 00:40:03.503
the resonant frequency,
because then current amplitude

00:40:03.503 --> 00:40:06.010
will build up indefinitely.
 

00:40:06.010 --> 00:40:07.900
That's also true in a swing.
 

00:40:07.900 --> 00:40:11.900
If you've got a swing and the
kid's coming back and forth,

00:40:11.900 --> 00:40:14.300
and you're reading a newspaper
just pushing the kid,

00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:17.800
you've got to push at the right
time to get the best result.

00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:20.621
And that kid's not going to fly
off, because there's one more

00:40:20.621 --> 00:40:23.159
term in the equation for the
kid, which is friction.

00:40:23.159 --> 00:40:25.750
But if you have a frictionless
swing and you're doing this,

00:40:25.750 --> 00:40:27.882
you've got to watch out,
because soon there'll be nobody

00:40:27.882 --> 00:40:31.137
around,
because the amplitude will keep

00:40:31.137 --> 00:40:31.969
growing.
 

00:40:31.969 --> 00:40:34.447
Well, these are unrealistic
problems, but I want you to

00:40:34.447 --> 00:40:35.320
notice one thing.
 

00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:37.050
Here's what I want you to
notice.

00:40:37.050 --> 00:40:41.117
The voltage you were given
looked like V_0

00:40:41.117 --> 00:40:45.260
cosÏt and the
current that you got,

00:40:45.260 --> 00:40:50.570
I can obtain by taking the
derivative of this charge,

00:40:50.570 --> 00:40:53.699
which is like dQ/dt.
 

00:40:53.699 --> 00:40:56.637
That's going to be
CËÏ

00:40:56.637 --> 00:41:00.737
sinÏt,
and CË, we can

00:41:00.737 --> 00:41:04.987
write as V_0/L
divided by Ï^(2) -

00:41:04.987 --> 00:41:08.139
Ï_0
^(2)sinÏt.

00:41:08.139 --> 00:41:10.559
This is I.
 

00:41:10.559 --> 00:41:14.018
Here's what I want you to
notice.

00:41:14.018 --> 00:41:17.552
It looks a lot like Ohm's law,
because the current looks like

00:41:17.552 --> 00:41:20.615
voltage divided by some number,
but that's a very big

00:41:20.615 --> 00:41:21.500
difference.
 

00:41:21.500 --> 00:41:27.000
The voltage is a cosine and the
current is a sine.

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:29.059
That's something I want you to
think about.

00:41:29.059 --> 00:41:33.529
The current is not in step with
the voltage, whereas in a

00:41:33.529 --> 00:41:36.722
resistor circuit,
the current follows the

00:41:36.722 --> 00:41:37.679
voltage.
 

00:41:37.679 --> 00:41:40.545
It's the same profile as the
voltage, except you divide by

00:41:40.545 --> 00:41:41.099
R.
 

00:41:41.099 --> 00:41:43.449
Here one is a cosine,
one is a sine.

00:41:43.449 --> 00:41:47.590
That means when one guy is at
maximum, other is at minimum.

00:41:47.590 --> 00:41:50.114
It's called out of phase,
in fact out of phase by 90

00:41:50.114 --> 00:41:50.610
degrees.
 

00:41:50.610 --> 00:41:51.420
Yes?
 

00:41:51.420 --> 00:41:54.844
Student:  ________ by
the C that you got,

00:41:54.844 --> 00:41:56.429
where did the omega go?
 

00:41:56.429 --> 00:41:57.300
Prof: Here?
 

00:41:57.300 --> 00:41:58.610
Student:  On the other
side.

00:41:58.610 --> 00:42:02.989
When you multiply that through
by the C--

00:42:02.989 --> 00:42:04.755
Prof: Oh,
Ï did not go,

00:42:04.755 --> 00:42:05.260
it's back.
 

00:42:05.260 --> 00:42:06.650
Right here. You're right.
 

00:42:06.650 --> 00:42:07.699
There's the Ï.
 

00:42:07.699 --> 00:42:08.289
That came from...
 

00:42:08.289 --> 00:42:21.889
 
 

00:42:21.889 --> 00:42:25.969
Okay, these problems,
the only thing I'm focusing on

00:42:25.969 --> 00:42:28.235
right now,
I would say of all the things I

00:42:28.235 --> 00:42:30.797
wrote there,
to be the most important thing

00:42:30.797 --> 00:42:33.257
is number one,
this is what I want you to bear

00:42:33.257 --> 00:42:33.659
in mind.
 

00:42:33.659 --> 00:42:35.967
That's why sometimes I'm not
paying attention to some

00:42:35.967 --> 00:42:36.500
constants.
 

00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:41.045
What is important to notice is
that this is an equation you can

00:42:41.045 --> 00:42:42.659
solve by inspection.
 

00:42:42.659 --> 00:42:45.210
Why was it easier to solve it
by inspection?

00:42:45.210 --> 00:42:48.411
Because you are trying to get
in the end a cosine to balance

00:42:48.411 --> 00:42:51.253
the right hand side,
and you're trying to find a

00:42:51.253 --> 00:42:55.259
function who is itself a cosine,
or whose second derivative is a

00:42:55.259 --> 00:42:57.217
cosine,
and we know the answer to that

00:42:57.217 --> 00:43:00.039
is a cosine,
so we can guess the answer.

00:43:00.039 --> 00:43:02.652
Once you guess the answer,
you put it in and you analyze

00:43:02.652 --> 00:43:04.409
the solution,
you notice also that the

00:43:04.409 --> 00:43:06.500
current and the voltage are not
in step.

00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:07.730
One is a cosine.
 

00:43:07.730 --> 00:43:10.119
You know what a cosine does,
it does that.

00:43:10.119 --> 00:43:13.039
Other is a sine,
so they are out of step.

00:43:13.039 --> 00:43:15.652
When one is at maximum,
the other is at minimum and so

00:43:15.652 --> 00:43:15.900
on.
 

00:43:15.900 --> 00:43:20.233
That means a current as a
function of time is not equal to

00:43:20.233 --> 00:43:24.489
the voltage as a function of
time divided by anything.

00:43:24.489 --> 00:43:29.047
There is nothing you can divide
a cosine by to turn it into a

00:43:29.047 --> 00:43:29.579
sine.
 

00:43:29.579 --> 00:43:34.472
Whereas with resistors,
you just divide by R,

00:43:34.472 --> 00:43:36.920
you get the current.
 

00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:43.860
Now for the more realistic
problem, the realistic problem

00:43:43.860 --> 00:43:50.056
has got a capacitor,
an inductor and a resistor and

00:43:50.056 --> 00:43:53.280
no other power supply.
 

00:43:53.280 --> 00:44:03.003
The equation obeyed by this one
will be Ld^(2)Q/dt^(2)

00:44:03.003 --> 00:44:11.510
(that stands for
LdI/dt) RdQ/dt 

00:44:11.510 --> 00:44:14.809
Q/C = 0.
 

00:44:14.809 --> 00:44:19.639
This is analogous to
md^(2)x/dt^(2)  (I don't

00:44:19.639 --> 00:44:24.469
know how you guys wrote this
thing last semester.

00:44:24.469 --> 00:44:35.784
It doesn't matter)
Î³dx/dt  kx =

00:44:35.784 --> 00:44:36.690
0.
 

00:44:36.690 --> 00:44:40.030
Notice that it's the same form.
 

00:44:40.030 --> 00:44:43.817
And I'm going to give this to
you as a homework problem to

00:44:43.817 --> 00:44:46.010
analyze the answer to this one.
 

00:44:46.010 --> 00:44:50.927
So this describes a problem
where you have a mass and a

00:44:50.927 --> 00:44:54.570
spring and some friction on the
table.

00:44:54.570 --> 00:44:57.952
This means if you pull it and
let it go, the oscillations will

00:44:57.952 --> 00:45:00.449
eventually get damped and it
will die down.

00:45:00.449 --> 00:45:06.423
And the general solution for
the case when it's oscillating

00:45:06.423 --> 00:45:11.985
will look like some number A
e to the minus some

00:45:11.985 --> 00:45:16.929
number Î±t times cosine
times some frequency

00:45:16.929 --> 00:45:19.300
Ï't.
 

00:45:19.300 --> 00:45:20.530
Let me see.
 

00:45:20.530 --> 00:45:24.335
You can always add a phase
Î¦,

00:45:24.335 --> 00:45:27.360
but I'm not going to do that.
 

00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:29.213
If you want,
you can put an extra Î¦,

00:45:29.213 --> 00:45:32.159
but I'll choose my origin of
time so that I don't have that.

00:45:32.159 --> 00:45:34.760
This is what the answer's going
to look like,

00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:37.838
where Ï' and
Î± are going to be

00:45:37.838 --> 00:45:41.219
controlled by L,
R and C.

00:45:41.219 --> 00:45:43.400
That's the thing I don't want
to do in class.

00:45:43.400 --> 00:45:45.670
Have you seen this before?
 

00:45:45.670 --> 00:45:48.230
Professor Harris tells me
you've seen this last time.

00:45:48.230 --> 00:45:52.114
And the hints in the homework
will guide you on how to do

00:45:52.114 --> 00:45:52.599
this.
 

00:45:52.599 --> 00:45:56.811
You just assume the solution
x at t looks like

00:45:56.811 --> 00:46:00.237
some A e to the - (I
don't want to call it

00:46:00.237 --> 00:46:04.018
Î± now)
Î² times t.

00:46:04.018 --> 00:46:07.483
You put it in the equation and
solve for Î² and

00:46:07.483 --> 00:46:10.521
you'll find Î²
will have a real part and

00:46:10.521 --> 00:46:11.860
an imaginary part.
 

00:46:11.860 --> 00:46:17.010
And you have to combine the two
to get this answer.

00:46:17.010 --> 00:46:21.137
Now that brings me to another
thing, so I don't know how

00:46:21.137 --> 00:46:25.117
prepared you guys are for what's
about to happen next,

00:46:25.117 --> 00:46:28.119
which is the use of complex
numbers.

00:46:28.119 --> 00:46:30.340
So everybody familiar with
complex numbers?

00:46:30.340 --> 00:46:34.190
Who doesn't know complex
numbers?

00:46:34.190 --> 00:46:36.440
How do you do your taxes?
 

00:46:36.440 --> 00:46:39.429
You don't know imaginary
numbers?

00:46:39.429 --> 00:46:42.809
So I will tell you.
 

00:46:42.809 --> 00:46:44.099
I'll give you a lightning
review.

00:46:44.099 --> 00:46:47.199
I'm assuming everybody has seen
them in high school.

00:46:47.199 --> 00:46:50.581
I will only tell you the part
you need, but I'm going to

00:46:50.581 --> 00:46:52.920
assume that I can use them
fluently.

00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:56.840
I don't want to stop every time
and worry about you guys.

00:46:56.840 --> 00:46:59.400
So I really need a show of
hands.

00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:04.369
Anybody never seen x iy
and x - iy?

00:47:04.369 --> 00:47:05.960
And how about
e^(iÎ¸)?

00:47:05.960 --> 00:47:07.929
You know that guy?
 

00:47:07.929 --> 00:47:09.039
Okay, that's all you need.
 

00:47:09.039 --> 00:47:10.960
So I'm going to tell you what
the deal is.

00:47:10.960 --> 00:47:12.900
So everyone knows what a
complex number is.

00:47:12.900 --> 00:47:15.599
We know i is square root
of -1.

00:47:15.599 --> 00:47:19.934
Then we know that we can write
a complex number as x iy

00:47:19.934 --> 00:47:24.268
and visualize it in a complex
plane where you measure x

00:47:24.268 --> 00:47:27.679
this way and iy is
measured that way.

00:47:27.679 --> 00:47:34.309
That's usually called a generic
complex number z.

00:47:34.309 --> 00:47:39.123
But now let us find the length
of that--the complex number is a

00:47:39.123 --> 00:47:41.920
single point in the complex
plane.

00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:47.340
The length of that is square
root of x^(2) y^(2).

00:47:47.340 --> 00:47:52.483
So I can also write z as
x divided by square root

00:47:52.483 --> 00:47:57.626
of x^(2) y^(2) i
times y divided by square

00:47:57.626 --> 00:48:02.521
root of x^(2) y^(2) times
the square root of x^(2)

00:48:02.521 --> 00:48:03.849
y^(2).
 

00:48:03.849 --> 00:48:06.340
Just done nothing,
just rearranged stuff.

00:48:06.340 --> 00:48:11.483
This is going to be called the
modulus of z,

00:48:11.483 --> 00:48:13.440
and what is this?
 

00:48:13.440 --> 00:48:16.510
This angle is Î¸
here.

00:48:16.510 --> 00:48:19.416
This is really
cosÎ¸

00:48:19.416 --> 00:48:24.480
isinÎ¸ times
modulus of z.

00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:28.670
And that, thanks to this great
identity by Euler,

00:48:28.670 --> 00:48:34.568
is e^(iÎ¸). Now I
don't know how much you know

00:48:34.568 --> 00:48:40.673
about this great formula that
relates e^(iÎ¸) to

00:48:40.673 --> 00:48:42.329
cosine sine.
 

00:48:42.329 --> 00:48:44.539
How many people know where it
comes from?

00:48:44.539 --> 00:48:49.030
What does it mean to raise
e to a complex power?

00:48:49.030 --> 00:48:51.039
You know where it really comes
from?

00:48:51.039 --> 00:48:51.809
Yes?
 

00:48:51.809 --> 00:48:52.739
Student: 
&gt;

00:48:52.739 --> 00:48:54.340
Prof: It comes from
power series.

00:48:54.340 --> 00:48:57.510
It turns out you can write a
power series for cosine.

00:48:57.510 --> 00:48:59.420
You can write a power series
for sine,

00:48:59.420 --> 00:49:03.751
then, for example,
cosine of Î¸ = 1

00:49:03.751 --> 00:49:08.179
â Î¸^(2) over
2 factorial,

00:49:08.179 --> 00:49:10.329
Î¸ to the 4
factorial,

00:49:10.329 --> 00:49:14.369
or 6 factorial, etc.
 

00:49:14.369 --> 00:49:16.963
And you can write a power
series for e^(Î¸) if

00:49:16.963 --> 00:49:19.458
you like,
which is 1 Î¸

00:49:19.458 --> 00:49:21.840
Î¸^(2)/2.
 

00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:25.514
This defines cosÎ¸
in the sense that if you put

00:49:25.514 --> 00:49:29.190
Î¸ = Î /2
in this infinite series,

00:49:29.190 --> 00:49:31.768
you will get 0.
 

00:49:31.768 --> 00:49:33.188
And if you put Î¸
= Î , you will get

00:49:33.188 --> 00:49:33.679
Î  -1.
 

00:49:33.679 --> 00:49:36.481
In other words,
in spite of this funny looking

00:49:36.481 --> 00:49:38.599
form, it really is the same guy.
 

00:49:38.599 --> 00:49:40.186
It will oscillate,
it will have zeros,

00:49:40.186 --> 00:49:41.130
it will be periodic.
 

00:49:41.130 --> 00:49:43.681
None of it is obvious,
but this power series is

00:49:43.681 --> 00:49:47.175
numerically equal to this one if
you keep the infinite number of

00:49:47.175 --> 00:49:47.730
turns.
 

00:49:47.730 --> 00:49:51.000
Likewise, e^(Î¸) is
defined by this series.

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:52.570
And similarly,
there's a formula for

00:49:52.570 --> 00:49:53.469
sinÎ¸.
 

00:49:53.469 --> 00:49:57.894
Now once a power series is
defined, you can put e raised to

00:49:57.894 --> 00:49:59.880
anything you want there.
 

00:49:59.880 --> 00:50:03.409
So you know what I'm going to
put there.

00:50:03.409 --> 00:50:07.739
e raised to dog is 1 dog
dog squared.

00:50:07.739 --> 00:50:09.119
This is not a joke.
 

00:50:09.119 --> 00:50:10.340
This is really true.
 

00:50:10.340 --> 00:50:11.268
This is the definition.
 

00:50:11.268 --> 00:50:13.398
If someone says,
"How do I raise e

00:50:13.398 --> 00:50:14.530
to the power dog?"
 

00:50:14.530 --> 00:50:15.829
you do this.
 

00:50:15.829 --> 00:50:17.940
This will have all the
properties of the exponential.

00:50:17.940 --> 00:50:19.289
It doesn't matter what's in the
exponent.

00:50:19.289 --> 00:50:20.969
That's the key.
 

00:50:20.969 --> 00:50:24.108
People originally put real
numbers, then they put complex

00:50:24.108 --> 00:50:24.670
numbers.
 

00:50:24.670 --> 00:50:27.500
Now they put matrices,
operators, anything you want.

00:50:27.500 --> 00:50:30.762
e raised to anything,
you formally define to be this

00:50:30.762 --> 00:50:33.239
infinite series,
provided the infinite series

00:50:33.239 --> 00:50:35.940
converges and gives you a
meaningful answer.

00:50:35.940 --> 00:50:38.331
In that sense,
if you put e^(iÎ¸)

00:50:38.331 --> 00:50:40.530
here,
and compare the result to

00:50:40.530 --> 00:50:42.840
cosÎ¸
isinÎ¸,

00:50:42.840 --> 00:50:44.440
it matches, that's all.
 

00:50:44.440 --> 00:50:48.139
I'm just going to keep using
that result.

00:50:48.139 --> 00:50:51.822
Then you should also know that
for every complex number,

00:50:51.822 --> 00:50:55.440
there's a complex conjugate,
which is x - iy.

00:50:55.440 --> 00:50:58.119
That means i goes to
-i.

00:50:58.119 --> 00:51:02.061
That means z,
the angle Î¸

00:51:02.061 --> 00:51:05.710
will change to
-Î¸.

00:51:05.710 --> 00:51:09.980
And given any complex number,
the real part of z,

00:51:09.980 --> 00:51:14.172
which is x,
is z z* over 2 and the

00:51:14.172 --> 00:51:20.019
imaginary part of z,
which is y,

00:51:20.019 --> 00:51:26.889
is z â
z* over 2i.

00:51:26.889 --> 00:51:29.329
This is what you need to know.
 

00:51:29.329 --> 00:51:32.219
Every complex number has a real
part and an imaginary part.

00:51:32.219 --> 00:51:34.920
In fact, z* looks like
this.

00:51:34.920 --> 00:51:37.820
And if you add z z*,
the vertical parts cancel

00:51:37.820 --> 00:51:40.110
and you get double the
horizontal part.

00:51:40.110 --> 00:51:41.840
That's why you divide by 2.
 

00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:45.650
You subtract and divide by
2i, you get y.

00:51:45.650 --> 00:51:49.181
Basically, that's all I want
you to know, but I want you to

00:51:49.181 --> 00:51:51.860
be able to manipulate them
rapidly enough.

00:51:51.860 --> 00:51:56.489
Here's something very useful
about complex numbers.

00:51:56.489 --> 00:52:02.717
Let's take a complex number
z_1 which is

00:52:02.717 --> 00:52:07.389
mod z_1
e^(iÎ¸1),

00:52:07.389 --> 00:52:09.909
and another complex number,
z_2,

00:52:09.909 --> 00:52:15.420
which is mod z_2
e^(iÎ¸2).

00:52:15.420 --> 00:52:16.840
So what do they look like?
 

00:52:16.840 --> 00:52:18.900
Well, z_1
looks like this,

00:52:18.900 --> 00:52:20.760
with some angle
Î¸_1,

00:52:20.760 --> 00:52:22.849
and z_2_
may look like that.

00:52:22.849 --> 00:52:25.018
It's got some angle
Î¸_2.

00:52:25.018 --> 00:52:28.119
So every complex number has a
length and an angle.

00:52:28.119 --> 00:52:29.239
You can think of it two ways.
 

00:52:29.239 --> 00:52:31.784
It's got an x part and a
y part,

00:52:31.784 --> 00:52:34.893
and a real and an imaginary,
or it's got a modulus and a

00:52:34.893 --> 00:52:35.460
phase.
 

00:52:35.460 --> 00:52:38.567
That's the Cartesian version of
the number and the polar number

00:52:38.567 --> 00:52:39.369
of the number.
 

00:52:39.369 --> 00:52:42.840
And the connection between them
comes from Euler's formula.

00:52:42.840 --> 00:52:45.911
But now look what happens when
I take the product

00:52:45.911 --> 00:52:48.280
z_1z
_2.

00:52:48.280 --> 00:52:51.260
I get mod z_1
mod z_2

00:52:51.260 --> 00:52:54.539
e^(iÎ¸)_1^(
Î¸)_2,

00:52:54.539 --> 00:52:59.559
because exponentials add when
you multiply them.

00:52:59.559 --> 00:53:02.065
Well, this allows you to
immediately guess what the

00:53:02.065 --> 00:53:03.670
product is going to look like.
 

00:53:03.670 --> 00:53:06.048
The product is going to have a
length equal to the length of

00:53:06.048 --> 00:53:08.469
z_1 times
length of z_2.

00:53:08.469 --> 00:53:11.418
It's going to have an angle,
I've not done a good picture

00:53:11.418 --> 00:53:13.715
here,
which is the sum of the two

00:53:13.715 --> 00:53:15.000
angles,
because it's

00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:17.639
Î¸_1
Î¸_2.

00:53:17.639 --> 00:53:21.860
So listen to this statement
very carefully.

00:53:21.860 --> 00:53:24.420
When you take a complex number,
say number 1,

00:53:24.420 --> 00:53:27.099
and you multiply it by a second
complex number,

00:53:27.099 --> 00:53:29.369
you do two things to the first
guy.

00:53:29.369 --> 00:53:33.619
You rescale it and you rotate
it.

00:53:33.619 --> 00:53:36.791
So two operations are done in
one shot when you use complex

00:53:36.791 --> 00:53:37.340
numbers.
 

00:53:37.340 --> 00:53:38.931
The mod z_2
rescale is the mod

00:53:38.931 --> 00:53:40.833
z_1 and
Î¸_2 adds

00:53:40.833 --> 00:53:42.010
to Î¸_1.
 

00:53:42.010 --> 00:53:43.655
Likewise, if you divide,
if you take

00:53:43.655 --> 00:53:46.286
z_1 over
z_2, it is mod

00:53:46.286 --> 00:53:48.871
z_1 over mod
z_2 times

00:53:48.871 --> 00:53:51.880
e^(iÎ¸)_1 ^(-
Î¸)_2,

00:53:51.880 --> 00:53:55.632
because the exponential
Î¸_2 is

00:53:55.632 --> 00:53:56.570
downstairs.
 

00:53:56.570 --> 00:53:59.619
So multiplication by real
numbers is very easy.

00:53:59.619 --> 00:54:02.577
You take a real number 4,
you multiply by 8,

00:54:02.577 --> 00:54:06.360
you'll get something in the
real axis 8 times longer.

00:54:06.360 --> 00:54:10.179
You multiply by -8,
you'll get something back here.

00:54:10.179 --> 00:54:12.088
With complex numbers,
you take a number,

00:54:12.088 --> 00:54:14.929
you multiply another number,
you rescale and you rotate.

00:54:14.929 --> 00:54:15.980
That's what I want you to know.
 

00:54:15.980 --> 00:54:19.920
That's going to be very
important for what I'm saying.

00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:22.889
Now I come to the problem I
really want to solve,

00:54:22.889 --> 00:54:31.639
which is an LCR circuit driven
by an alternating source,

00:54:31.639 --> 00:54:34.449
V_0
cosÏt.

00:54:34.449 --> 00:54:37.599
This is R,
this is C and this is

00:54:37.599 --> 00:54:38.369
L.
 

00:54:38.369 --> 00:54:45.592
And the equation we have to
solve is L dI/dt

00:54:45.592 --> 00:54:52.672
RI 1/C integral
I dt =

00:54:52.672 --> 00:54:59.030
V_0
cosÏt.

00:54:59.030 --> 00:55:03.512
Because Q is the
integral up to time t of the

00:55:03.512 --> 00:55:06.065
current,
that's just Q/C. It's

00:55:06.065 --> 00:55:09.077
the same equation,
but now, unlike in this

00:55:09.077 --> 00:55:12.510
problem, where I had no driving
voltage,

00:55:12.510 --> 00:55:14.987
I have a driving voltage,
and I've also written it in

00:55:14.987 --> 00:55:17.369
terms of current rather than in
terms of charge.

00:55:17.369 --> 00:55:19.514
Because in electrical
engineering, you don't really

00:55:19.514 --> 00:55:21.059
watch the charge in the
capacitor.

00:55:21.059 --> 00:55:24.809
You look at the current flowing
through the circuit.

00:55:24.809 --> 00:55:28.190
So you have to solve this
equation.

00:55:28.190 --> 00:55:31.219
The question is,
can you guess the answer?

00:55:31.219 --> 00:55:32.150
That's the only way we know.
 

00:55:32.150 --> 00:55:34.449
You've got to guess.
 

00:55:34.449 --> 00:55:38.460
You're trying to find a
function, I of t,

00:55:38.460 --> 00:55:41.735
so that when you differentiate
it, you get a cosine

00:55:41.735 --> 00:55:44.237
Ït,
when you integrate it,

00:55:44.237 --> 00:55:46.179
you get a cosine
Ït.

00:55:46.179 --> 00:55:47.659
So far we can do it.
 

00:55:47.659 --> 00:55:49.349
Sine Ït will do it.
 

00:55:49.349 --> 00:55:53.588
But when you leave it alone,
then also you get a cosine

00:55:53.588 --> 00:55:56.650
Ït. You cannot do
that,

00:55:56.650 --> 00:55:59.789
because sine will become a
cosine and sine will become a

00:55:59.789 --> 00:56:00.190
sine.
 

00:56:00.190 --> 00:56:03.840
In the LC circuit,
when you didn't have this guy,

00:56:03.840 --> 00:56:06.360
we were okay,
because if you pick a sine,

00:56:06.360 --> 00:56:10.079
this became a cosine and that
also became a cosine and you can

00:56:10.079 --> 00:56:11.969
combine them to get a cosine.
 

00:56:11.969 --> 00:56:14.478
But you cannot have
dI/dt,

00:56:14.478 --> 00:56:19.103
I and integral of I all in one
equation and all satisfied by

00:56:19.103 --> 00:56:21.219
trigonometric function.
 

00:56:21.219 --> 00:56:24.567
The only time we can guess the
answer is if it looks like

00:56:24.567 --> 00:56:26.719
V_0
e^(Î±t).

00:56:26.719 --> 00:56:29.789
Suppose that was the voltage.
 

00:56:29.789 --> 00:56:33.579
Then can you guess the answer,
what form the answer will have?

00:56:33.579 --> 00:56:36.539
It will also be e^(Î±t)
times some number,

00:56:36.539 --> 00:56:38.630
because then this will look
e^(Î±t), that will

00:56:38.630 --> 00:56:40.576
look like e^(Î±t),
that will look like

00:56:40.576 --> 00:56:41.389
e^(Î±t).
 

00:56:41.389 --> 00:56:43.764
e^(Î±t) has a great
property that whether you

00:56:43.764 --> 00:56:45.394
multiply it,
whether you integrate it,

00:56:45.394 --> 00:56:46.869
differentiate it or leave it
alone,

00:56:46.869 --> 00:56:48.630
it looks the same.
 

00:56:48.630 --> 00:56:50.577
Unfortunately,
no one's interested in this

00:56:50.577 --> 00:56:52.860
voltage, because it's growing
exponentially fast,

00:56:52.860 --> 00:56:55.380
or if you put a - sign,
it's dying exponentially.

00:56:55.380 --> 00:56:58.389
What we really want is this.
 

00:56:58.389 --> 00:57:02.380
So the question is,
how do we solve this problem

00:57:02.380 --> 00:57:04.590
with cosÏt?
 

00:57:04.590 --> 00:57:08.130
So we're going to use a certain
trick.

00:57:08.130 --> 00:57:12.708
The trick I'm going to use is
the following:

00:57:12.708 --> 00:57:18.884
let me take a general case
where this is some function V

00:57:18.884 --> 00:57:23.436
of t,
where I'm not even assuming

00:57:23.436 --> 00:57:24.980
V is real.
 

00:57:24.980 --> 00:57:28.413
I'm not assuming I is
real, but L and R

00:57:28.413 --> 00:57:29.809
and C are real.
 

00:57:29.809 --> 00:57:33.119
Everything else can be complex
numbers.

00:57:33.119 --> 00:57:36.101
Now once you have an equation
and you've found a solution,

00:57:36.101 --> 00:57:38.559
if you take the complex
conjugate of both sides,

00:57:38.559 --> 00:57:39.920
they will still match.
 

00:57:39.920 --> 00:57:41.480
Do you understand that?
 

00:57:41.480 --> 00:57:44.753
If two things are equal,
their complex conjugates are

00:57:44.753 --> 00:57:47.318
equal,
because this thing is the real

00:57:47.318 --> 00:57:51.449
imaginary that balances the real
imaginary on the other side.

00:57:51.449 --> 00:57:54.335
Complex conjugate just reverses
the imaginary terms,

00:57:54.335 --> 00:57:57.280
so they will still match when
you flip both sides.

00:57:57.280 --> 00:58:05.221
So it means if you take L
dI* of dt R times

00:58:05.221 --> 00:58:13.871
I* 1/C integral I* of
t' dt' t = V* of

00:58:13.871 --> 00:58:15.289
t.
 

00:58:15.289 --> 00:58:18.125
So star is the rule by which if
V had a real and

00:58:18.125 --> 00:58:20.539
imaginary part,
you flip the imaginary part.

00:58:20.539 --> 00:58:25.501
So that solution for V
of t implies a second

00:58:25.501 --> 00:58:26.460
equation.
 

00:58:26.460 --> 00:58:29.090
In other words,
if the voltage V drives

00:58:29.090 --> 00:58:31.840
a current I,
the conjugate of the voltage

00:58:31.840 --> 00:58:34.179
drives the conjugate of the
current.

00:58:34.179 --> 00:58:35.929
That simply follows from the
equation.

00:58:35.929 --> 00:58:38.804
It comes from the fact that
when I conjugated it,

00:58:38.804 --> 00:58:40.960
L, R and C are
real.

00:58:40.960 --> 00:58:42.530
Do you understand that?
 

00:58:42.530 --> 00:58:45.682
Suppose L were imaginary
or had imaginary part,

00:58:45.682 --> 00:58:48.480
then I must also put a
conjugate on L.

00:58:48.480 --> 00:58:50.574
Then I* obeys a
different equation,

00:58:50.574 --> 00:58:53.639
because this had L in
it, this had L* in it.

00:58:53.639 --> 00:58:57.338
But if everything is real,
I* obeys the same

00:58:57.338 --> 00:59:00.889
equation when you have a
V* driving it.

00:59:00.889 --> 00:59:02.510
I'm almost done now.
 

00:59:02.510 --> 00:59:06.067
I want you to add the left hand
side to the left hand side and

00:59:06.067 --> 00:59:09.800
the right hand side to the right
hand side, and what do I get?

00:59:09.800 --> 00:59:13.869
Well, if I write it here,
you may not be able to see it.

00:59:13.869 --> 00:59:15.469
Let me put it here then.
 

00:59:15.469 --> 00:59:21.956
If you add these two,
you'd get L d/dt of

00:59:21.956 --> 00:59:29.547
I I* R
times I I* 1/C

00:59:29.547 --> 00:59:37.414
integral of I I* dt =
V V*. This again comes

00:59:37.414 --> 00:59:44.039
because the equation is a linear
equation.

00:59:44.039 --> 00:59:46.956
You can always add the left
hand side and the right hand

00:59:46.956 --> 00:59:49.871
side to get another problem
where the driving voltage is

00:59:49.871 --> 00:59:52.630
V V* and the driving
current is I I*,

00:59:52.630 --> 00:59:58.760
etc.
 

00:59:58.760 --> 01:00:05.795
But I I* is 2 times the
real part of I and V

01:00:05.795 --> 01:00:11.190
V* is 2 times the real part
of V.

01:00:11.190 --> 01:00:17.644
Therefore this implies that
L d/dt of the real part

01:00:17.644 --> 01:00:24.552
of I R plus the
real part of I 1/C

01:00:24.552 --> 01:00:31.460
times the integral of the real
part of I = real part of

01:00:31.460 --> 01:00:33.159
V.
 

01:00:33.159 --> 01:00:36.289
So let me say in words what the
equation means.

01:00:36.289 --> 01:00:40.655
If you by luck solve an
equation with a complex

01:00:40.655 --> 01:00:43.461
potential V,
and you get a current,

01:00:43.461 --> 01:00:47.297
then the answer to the problem
where the potential is only the

01:00:47.297 --> 01:00:50.440
real part of the actual
potential you applied,

01:00:50.440 --> 01:00:53.630
the current will be the real
part of the answer you got.

01:00:53.630 --> 01:00:55.268
That's all I want you to know.
 

01:00:55.268 --> 01:00:58.565
If you solve a complex problem
with a driving voltage which is

01:00:58.565 --> 01:01:00.293
complex--
which is just a mathematical

01:01:00.293 --> 01:01:02.259
fiction,
in real life you don't have

01:01:02.259 --> 01:01:05.610
that--then the current that you
get will also be complex.

01:01:05.610 --> 01:01:09.000
But its real part will be due
to the real part of your

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:09.639
voltage.
 

01:01:09.639 --> 01:01:12.123
And you can also show the
imaginary part of the current

01:01:12.123 --> 01:01:14.469
will be due to the imaginary
part of the voltage.

01:01:14.469 --> 01:01:17.710
This is just the principle of
superposition.

01:01:17.710 --> 01:01:19.260
So here is the trick we are
going to use.

01:01:19.260 --> 01:01:22.480
We are going to go back to
original equation,

01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:29.469
LdI/dt RI 1/C integral
I dt = V_0cos

01:01:29.469 --> 01:01:33.849
Ït,
and we're going to solve a new

01:01:33.849 --> 01:01:34.489
problem.
 

01:01:34.489 --> 01:01:39.027
We're going to solve a problem
where this is V_0

01:01:39.027 --> 01:01:40.539
e^(iÏt).
 

01:01:40.539 --> 01:01:42.831
And the current for that,
I'm going to call some

01:01:42.831 --> 01:01:43.710
IË.
 

01:01:43.710 --> 01:01:49.800
It's a complex current,
because the driving voltage is

01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:52.099
a complex voltage.
 

01:01:52.099 --> 01:01:54.597
So think of
Ve^(iÏt) as the

01:01:54.597 --> 01:01:56.840
V in the previous
problem.

01:01:56.840 --> 01:02:00.282
The actual problem I was given
had V_0cos

01:02:00.282 --> 01:02:02.554
Ït,
but you know that

01:02:02.554 --> 01:02:04.597
V_0
e^(iÏt) is

01:02:04.597 --> 01:02:07.264
V_0
cosÏt I

01:02:07.264 --> 01:02:10.159
times V_0
sinÏt.

01:02:10.159 --> 01:02:13.559
Consequently,
this potential has a real part

01:02:13.559 --> 01:02:16.536
which is a cosine,
an imaginary part which is a

01:02:16.536 --> 01:02:19.309
sine, and the current will have
a real and imaginary part.

01:02:19.309 --> 01:02:22.740
The answer to the original
question is the real part of the

01:02:22.740 --> 01:02:24.280
answer to this question.
 

01:02:24.280 --> 01:02:25.760
This is what you should think
about.

01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:28.849
This is what you should
understand.

01:02:28.849 --> 01:02:33.588
So I've manufactured a problem
with an unphysical complex

01:02:33.588 --> 01:02:35.869
voltage,
and all I know is that at the

01:02:35.869 --> 01:02:38.534
end of the day,
if I take the real part of the

01:02:38.534 --> 01:02:40.556
current,
I'll get the answer to the real

01:02:40.556 --> 01:02:42.931
part of the potential,
which happens to be the actual

01:02:42.931 --> 01:02:44.574
potential,
V_0

01:02:44.574 --> 01:02:46.260
cosÏt.
 

01:02:46.260 --> 01:02:48.289
So why would I do all this?
 

01:02:48.289 --> 01:02:50.713
Why would I take a problem
that's bad enough with the

01:02:50.713 --> 01:02:52.949
cosine and turn it into a
complex exponential?

01:02:52.949 --> 01:02:56.679
I think you can sort of guess
what the reason is.

01:02:56.679 --> 01:03:00.141
The reason is that it may be
complex, but it's still an

01:03:00.141 --> 01:03:01.039
exponential.
 

01:03:01.039 --> 01:03:04.050
That means its derivative is
going to look just the same.

01:03:04.050 --> 01:03:07.920
That means I can make a guess
that the current IË

01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:11.586
is proportional to
e^(iÏt). So you can

01:03:11.586 --> 01:03:15.253
make the assumption that
IË of t is

01:03:15.253 --> 01:03:19.056
some constant IË
times e^(iÏt).

01:03:19.056 --> 01:03:23.266
Make that assumption and put it
into this equation and see what

01:03:23.266 --> 01:03:24.489
you get.
 

01:03:24.489 --> 01:03:30.722
You will find you will get
IÏL times

01:03:30.722 --> 01:03:37.809
IË R times
IË  1/IÏC

01:03:37.809 --> 01:03:42.697
times IË
times e^(IÏt) is

01:03:42.697 --> 01:03:46.730
V_0e^(iÏt).
 

01:03:46.730 --> 01:03:51.429
This is because if you assume
the current is an exponential,

01:03:51.429 --> 01:03:55.264
every derivative = an
iÏ and every integral

01:03:55.264 --> 01:03:59.380
= 1/iÏ, and
multiplying is just multiplying.

01:03:59.380 --> 01:04:02.170
So d/dt has got to be
replaced by Ï,

01:04:02.170 --> 01:04:05.731
and you get this equation
for IË. That means

01:04:05.731 --> 01:04:10.894
you will satisfy the equation,
provided IË times

01:04:10.894 --> 01:04:13.449
all of this = V .
 

01:04:13.449 --> 01:04:16.362
And I'm going to write this as
Z times IË

01:04:16.362 --> 01:04:18.965
= V where Z is the
name for all the guys

01:04:18.965 --> 01:04:20.630
multiplying IË.
 

01:04:20.630 --> 01:04:21.780
So I'll start with that here.
 

01:04:21.780 --> 01:04:39.420
 
 

01:04:39.420 --> 01:04:43.469
Okay.
 

01:04:43.469 --> 01:04:50.501
So I wrote iÏL
R 1 over iÏC

01:04:50.501 --> 01:04:56.255
IË e^(iÏt) is
V_0

01:04:56.255 --> 01:04:59.070
e^(iÏt).
 

01:04:59.070 --> 01:05:02.960
Everybody get that?
 

01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:07.360
That's because differentiating
on an exponential is just

01:05:07.360 --> 01:05:09.760
multiplying by the exponent.
 

01:05:09.760 --> 01:05:12.219
So this is a complex number.
 

01:05:12.219 --> 01:05:17.199
R iÏL â
i/ÏC.

01:05:17.199 --> 01:05:20.965
I want you to know that i
in the bottom is like -i

01:05:20.965 --> 01:05:22.050
in the top.
 

01:05:22.050 --> 01:05:26.653
And this is called the
impedance Z,

01:05:26.653 --> 01:05:29.349
it's a complex number.
 

01:05:29.349 --> 01:05:32.074
You can visualize the complex
number as follows:

01:05:32.074 --> 01:05:34.510
it's got a real part,
which is R.

01:05:34.510 --> 01:05:38.268
It's got an imaginary part,
which is ÏL â

01:05:38.268 --> 01:05:41.577
1/ÏC,
and the impedance Z is a

01:05:41.577 --> 01:05:44.860
complex number with some modulus
and some phase.

01:05:44.860 --> 01:05:47.427
If you know the real and
imaginary parts,

01:05:47.427 --> 01:05:50.960
you can construct the modulus
in the phase like that.

01:05:50.960 --> 01:05:53.860
If you want,
it's the modulus of Z.

01:05:53.860 --> 01:06:00.983
Therefore canceling this,
I find IË

01:06:00.983 --> 01:06:04.960
= V_0/Z.
 

01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:10.063
That becomes V_0 over
the modulus of Z times

01:06:10.063 --> 01:06:14.688
e^(i)^(Î¦),
where Î¦ is this angle

01:06:14.688 --> 01:06:19.112
defined by tanÎ¦
= ÏL â

01:06:19.112 --> 01:06:22.340
1/ÏC divided by R.
 

01:06:22.340 --> 01:06:24.655
So don't worry too much about
writing all of this down,

01:06:24.655 --> 01:06:26.800
because this you're going to
find in every book.

01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:31.110
There's nothing novel or
different.

01:06:31.110 --> 01:06:34.300
So this is the formula for
I twiddle.

01:06:34.300 --> 01:06:38.539
Now I itself,
you remember,

01:06:38.539 --> 01:06:41.570
= IË of 0.
 

01:06:41.570 --> 01:06:44.070
I'm sorry, this is
IË of 0.

01:06:44.070 --> 01:06:48.460
Did I define it that way?
 

01:06:48.460 --> 01:06:49.849
Yeah, I should write it--I'm
sorry.

01:06:49.849 --> 01:06:52.820
I should write it as
IË of 0.

01:06:52.820 --> 01:06:58.996
There's a subscript 0 there,
because the full I twiddle has

01:06:58.996 --> 01:07:02.829
got an e^(iÏt) in
it.

01:07:02.829 --> 01:07:10.331
That looks like
V_0 over mod

01:07:10.331 --> 01:07:19.880
Z times e^(iÏt -
)^(Î¦).

01:07:19.880 --> 01:07:23.327
But this is not the physical
current, because it's the result

01:07:23.327 --> 01:07:24.650
of a complex voltage.
 

01:07:24.650 --> 01:07:26.768
The physical current is a real
part of this,

01:07:26.768 --> 01:07:30.427
without the twiddle,
that we write as real part of

01:07:30.427 --> 01:07:34.010
IË. Where do I get
the real part?

01:07:34.010 --> 01:07:36.530
V_0 and
absolute value of Z are

01:07:36.530 --> 01:07:37.090
both real.
 

01:07:37.090 --> 01:07:41.302
Real part of e to the
i something is cosine of

01:07:41.302 --> 01:07:43.730
something and that's our answer.
 

01:07:43.730 --> 01:07:51.210
That's our answer,
the final answer you get.

01:07:51.210 --> 01:07:54.304
This tells you that the current
has a magnitude which is

01:07:54.304 --> 01:07:57.679
V_0 over the
absolute value of Z,

01:07:57.679 --> 01:08:00.753
and it's got a phase
Î¦ by which it is

01:08:00.753 --> 01:08:02.650
behind the driving voltage.
 

01:08:02.650 --> 01:08:05.070
The magnitude of Z for
as in any complex number,

01:08:05.070 --> 01:08:07.088
if someone says,
"What's the magnitude of

01:08:07.088 --> 01:08:07.940
Z?"
 

01:08:07.940 --> 01:08:18.987
it is simply square root of
real part squared imaginary part

01:08:18.987 --> 01:08:20.859
squared.
 

01:08:20.859 --> 01:08:26.368
So I want you to think about
the magic of complex numbers.

01:08:26.368 --> 01:08:30.613
Your final answer has a current
which is a cosÏt -

01:08:30.613 --> 01:08:31.640
Î¦.
 

01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:34.720
Your driving voltage is a
cosÏt.

01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:38.336
There is no way you can divide
the voltage by anything to get

01:08:38.336 --> 01:08:39.238
that current.
 

01:08:39.238 --> 01:08:44.623
But in the complex language,
the complex current is the

01:08:44.623 --> 01:08:49.710
complex voltage divided by the
complex impedance.

01:08:49.710 --> 01:08:50.710
How does the happen?
 

01:08:50.710 --> 01:08:54.548
That happens because impendence
Z has got a magnitude and

01:08:54.548 --> 01:08:56.765
a phase,
therefore if you had a voltage

01:08:56.765 --> 01:08:59.240
V_0
e^(iÏt) and you divide

01:08:59.240 --> 01:09:01.819
by mod Z e^(i)
^(Î¦) , that

01:09:01.819 --> 01:09:04.500
becomes e^(-i)
^(Î¦) upstairs.

01:09:04.500 --> 01:09:08.770
You're able to change the
magnitude and you're able to

01:09:08.770 --> 01:09:11.270
change the phase by dividing.
 

01:09:11.270 --> 01:09:14.380
So if you want to take the
voltage and you want to rescale

01:09:14.380 --> 01:09:16.711
it and shift its phase,
all in one shot,

01:09:16.711 --> 01:09:19.560
you can do it if you divide by
a complex number,

01:09:19.560 --> 01:09:23.970
because a complex number will
rescale it and also shift its

01:09:23.970 --> 01:09:24.579
phase.
 

01:09:24.579 --> 01:09:28.078
And then you take the real part.
 

01:09:28.078 --> 01:09:30.203
In other words,
cosÏt divided by

01:09:30.203 --> 01:09:31.988
nothing will give you
cosÏt -

01:09:31.988 --> 01:09:35.100
Î¦,
but e^(iÏt),

01:09:35.100 --> 01:09:37.010
when divided by
e^(i)^(Î¦),

01:09:37.010 --> 01:09:38.670
will in fact give you
e^(iÏt -

01:09:38.670 --> 01:09:39.720
i)^(Î¦).
 

01:09:39.720 --> 01:09:43.061
So that phase shift we can
produce only by dividing with a

01:09:43.061 --> 01:09:44.060
complex number.
 

01:09:44.060 --> 01:09:47.627
So I'll come back and explain
to you a little bit more on how

01:09:47.627 --> 01:09:50.899
you do circuit problems using
the complex impedance,

01:09:50.899 --> 01:09:53.887
but I think it will be helpful
for those of you who don't know

01:09:53.887 --> 01:09:56.239
complex numbers to get use to
this part of it.

01:09:56.239 --> 01:10:02.000

00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:03.257
Prof: Okay,
today we're going to talk about

00:00:03.257 --> 00:00:05.969
life history evolution,
and life history evolution

00:00:05.969 --> 00:00:08.080
deals with some big questions.
 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.160
It's explained why organisms
are small or large,

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.934
why they mature early or late,
why they have few or many

00:00:14.934 --> 00:00:16.936
offspring,
and why they have a short or a

00:00:16.936 --> 00:00:17.430
long life.
 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.010
Basically what life history
evolution does is it analyzes

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:24.400
the evolution of all of the
components of fitness,

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.307
all the different things that
combine to result in lifetime

00:00:27.307 --> 00:00:30.584
reproductive success,
and in so doing it visualizes

00:00:30.584 --> 00:00:34.806
the design of the organism as an
evolutionary solution to an

00:00:34.806 --> 00:00:36.380
ecological problem.
 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:41.611
So it's fundamentally about the
interface between evolution and

00:00:41.611 --> 00:00:44.408
ecology,
and it is one of the places

00:00:44.408 --> 00:00:48.492
where scientists confronted the
problem of how do we explain

00:00:48.492 --> 00:00:52.230
phenotypic evolution rather than
genetic evolution?

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.461
So this is really about the
design of the large-scale

00:00:56.461 --> 00:01:00.121
features of organisms,
and it brings us to ask

00:01:00.121 --> 00:01:04.108
questions about ourselves as
well, of course.

00:01:04.108 --> 00:01:08.328
Why is it that we have a
lifespan of about eighty years?

00:01:08.328 --> 00:01:11.786
Why is it that we're about
three kilos when we're born,

00:01:11.786 --> 00:01:12.489
etcetera?
 

00:01:12.489 --> 00:01:16.519
Okay, so we fit into this
matrix of questions.

00:01:16.519 --> 00:01:18.080
Now here are a few world
records.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.599
Biggest baby is a blue whale,
twelve tons.

00:01:22.599 --> 00:01:26.168
And the interesting thing about
it is that it will grow to be

00:01:26.168 --> 00:01:28.310
sixty tons in the next six
months.

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:29.470
So it's really pumping it in.
 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.480
And by the way,
a mother blue whale,

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.902
and most whale mothers,
actually have muscles in their

00:01:34.902 --> 00:01:38.325
breasts so that they actively
pump the milk into their

00:01:38.325 --> 00:01:39.230
offspring.
 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:40.640
Baby isn't just sucking.
 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.860
Baby is attached to a fire hose.
 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:43.530
Okay?
 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.879
&gt;
 

00:01:45.879 --> 00:01:48.849
And look at what happens to the
mom.

00:01:48.849 --> 00:01:52.577
She goes to warm tropical
waters to give birth,

00:01:52.577 --> 00:01:55.819
has her baby,
and then she nourishes that

00:01:55.819 --> 00:02:00.519
child until it is independent,
without eating herself.

00:02:00.519 --> 00:02:04.533
Imagine how big she is,
because he turns into something

00:02:04.533 --> 00:02:05.500
sixty tons.
 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.551
And you can imagine how cranky
she is before she swims back to

00:02:09.551 --> 00:02:11.280
Antarctica to get lunch.
 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.508
Okay?
 

00:02:12.508 --> 00:02:17.283
Then if you ask yourself,
for a given body weight what is

00:02:17.283 --> 00:02:18.990
the biggest thing?
 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.378
It's not the blue whale baby,
it's the babies--

00:02:21.378 --> 00:02:25.384
the twin babies of a bat are
the largest weight of any

00:02:25.384 --> 00:02:29.669
offspring in mammals,
and she actually flies with

00:02:29.669 --> 00:02:30.220
them.
 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.030
And in the kiwi,
it has a 400 gram egg.

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.651
If you take a radiograph,
if you put a kiwi into an x-ray

00:02:39.651 --> 00:02:42.055
machine,
take a radiograph of it,

00:02:42.055 --> 00:02:44.983
you are to imagine an egg
that's occupying about

00:02:44.983 --> 00:02:47.849
two-thirds of the body cavity of
the kiwi,

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:49.310
it's got a giant egg.
 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.377
The fewest offspring per
lifetime of anything that's out

00:02:53.377 --> 00:02:56.038
there bearing a significant
risk--

00:02:56.038 --> 00:02:58.530
and this is actually less than
humans--

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.131
is the Mexican dung beetle,
that only has four to five

00:03:01.131 --> 00:03:03.890
babies per lifetime,
which is pretty remarkable when

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:07.049
you think about how risky you
would think life would be for a

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:08.258
Mexican dung beetle.
 

00:03:08.258 --> 00:03:10.804
How can it get away with only
having four or five babies,

00:03:10.804 --> 00:03:12.438
if some of them are likely to
die?

00:03:12.438 --> 00:03:14.909
But, in fact,
it has such good parental care

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:17.324
that it's around,
and it's doing just fine,

00:03:17.324 --> 00:03:19.908
thank you, with only four to
five babies.

00:03:19.908 --> 00:03:23.818
And the most offspring per
reproductive event is orchids.

00:03:23.818 --> 00:03:27.852
Orchids produce typically
billions of seeds and they are

00:03:27.852 --> 00:03:31.956
extremely tiny and the only
reason that they can hatch is

00:03:31.956 --> 00:03:35.770
that they have a fungal midwife
that helps them.

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:38.960
Orchid hatching is dependent
upon fungi.

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:42.568
So the mother doesn't have to
put the nutrients into the seed.

00:03:42.568 --> 00:03:44.590
So she makes billions of tiny
seeds.

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.324
And in bivalves and codfish,
they can get up to hundreds of

00:03:48.324 --> 00:03:51.160
millions of eggs per
reproductive attempt.

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.251
So you can see that just by
comparing some numbers and

00:03:54.251 --> 00:03:56.455
looking broadly--
and this is a typical thing

00:03:56.455 --> 00:03:58.000
that happens in comparative
biology,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.639
it's one of the neat things
about it--

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:02.407
if you look across the Tree of
Life and you see how different

00:04:02.407 --> 00:04:04.068
things live their life
histories,

00:04:04.068 --> 00:04:06.628
you'll immediately start to ask
questions.

00:04:06.628 --> 00:04:08.895
You guys have all been
generating wonderful questions

00:04:08.895 --> 00:04:09.419
this week.
 

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:11.163
You look at that stuff and you
say, "Well why are things

00:04:11.163 --> 00:04:11.628
big and small?
 

00:04:11.628 --> 00:04:13.438
Why do they have few babies or
many babies?

00:04:13.438 --> 00:04:16.278
What has caused the evolution
of all of this diversity?"

00:04:16.278 --> 00:04:22.589
So here is the largest whale
and the smallest dolphin.

00:04:22.589 --> 00:04:24.120
So this is the whale radiation.
 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.612
You can see that since the
ancestor, there's been

00:04:26.612 --> 00:04:28.430
considerable change in body
size.

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:32.079
Here's Pipistrellus,
flying with babies.

00:04:32.079 --> 00:04:36.579
Here's a dung beetle,
and it's going to lay its egg

00:04:36.579 --> 00:04:38.829
into that pile of dung.
 

00:04:38.829 --> 00:04:42.846
That's why it's going to have
an extremely well protected

00:04:42.846 --> 00:04:43.350
baby.
 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:45.560
Not too many things are going
to come along and eat baby.

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:46.750
&gt;
 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:49.230
And here's a kiwi with its egg.
 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:50.269
Okay?
 

00:04:50.269 --> 00:04:53.360
So diversity.
 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:58.896
So in the history of ideas,
life history theory and the

00:04:58.896 --> 00:05:04.226
rest of evolutionary and
behavioral ecology fit about

00:05:04.226 --> 00:05:05.149
here.
 

00:05:05.149 --> 00:05:08.528
Darwin showed us that natural
selection and descent with

00:05:08.528 --> 00:05:11.540
modification from ancestors can
explain a lot,

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:16.100
but then genetics remained a
problem until 1900.

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:18.994
Then we had the genetical
reaction to that issue,

00:05:18.994 --> 00:05:22.310
which is the neo-Darwinian
synthesis that basically says

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:24.180
Darwin works with genetics.
 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:28.035
And this concentration on
genetics then,

00:05:28.035 --> 00:05:31.889
in its own turn,
elicited a reaction.

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:33.500
So this is a reaction to that.
 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.199
And what's the role of
phenotypes in evolution is the

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:40.190
reaction to the neo-Darwinian
synthesis.

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:44.000
So the phenotypic reaction,
it's been going on for about

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:44.970
forty years.
 

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:48.399
It has a selectionist
part--that is,

00:05:48.399 --> 00:05:50.879
how are phenotypes designed for
reproductive success--

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:53.973
and it has a developmental
part: what are the restrictions

00:05:53.973 --> 00:05:56.199
on the expression of genetic
variation?

00:05:56.199 --> 00:06:00.252
So the phenotypes are actually
both being designed by natural

00:06:00.252 --> 00:06:03.088
selection for reproductive
success and,

00:06:03.088 --> 00:06:05.060
in the process of their
production,

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:10.649
they are themselves editing
genetic variation.

00:06:10.649 --> 00:06:13.502
So life history evolution is
the part that explains the

00:06:13.502 --> 00:06:16.088
design of phenotypes for
reproductive success,

00:06:16.088 --> 00:06:19.970
and it concentrates on size at
birth,

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:24.199
how fast things grow,
age and size at maturity,

00:06:24.199 --> 00:06:27.603
reproductive investment,
and mortality rates and

00:06:27.603 --> 00:06:28.399
lifespan.
 

00:06:28.399 --> 00:06:31.336
So part of life history
evolution is why do we grow old

00:06:31.336 --> 00:06:31.879
and die?
 

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:41.579
And after a lot of discussion,
it was possible--

00:06:41.579 --> 00:06:43.759
this is after about twenty
years of discussion--

00:06:43.759 --> 00:06:46.475
to make this simple statement:
What causes life histories to

00:06:46.475 --> 00:06:46.889
evolve?
 

00:06:46.889 --> 00:06:50.913
They result from the
interaction of extrinsic and

00:06:50.913 --> 00:06:52.589
intrinsic factors.
 

00:06:52.589 --> 00:06:56.833
So the extrinsic factors are
things that are influencing the

00:06:56.833 --> 00:07:00.286
age-specific rates of mortality
and reproduction,

00:07:00.286 --> 00:07:03.019
and that's where ecology comes
in.

00:07:03.019 --> 00:07:05.589
It's not just ecology,
there's a lot of phylogenetic

00:07:05.589 --> 00:07:09.163
effects on this stuff,
but the point is that if you

00:07:09.163 --> 00:07:13.543
look at whatever is affecting
changes in mortality and

00:07:13.543 --> 00:07:16.439
reproduction,
in age and size of the

00:07:16.439 --> 00:07:20.571
organism, you will be able to
explain a great deal of what you

00:07:20.571 --> 00:07:22.399
see in the life history.
 

00:07:22.399 --> 00:07:24.459
But that's not enough.
 

00:07:24.459 --> 00:07:27.264
There's interaction between
that and factors that are

00:07:27.264 --> 00:07:30.875
intrinsic to the organism,
and the intrinsic factors are

00:07:30.875 --> 00:07:33.839
conceptualized as tradeoffs
among traits.

00:07:33.839 --> 00:07:35.800
The idea here is there's no
free lunch.

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:38.836
If you change one thing in
evolution, a byproduct of that

00:07:38.836 --> 00:07:41.170
change will be a change in
another trait.

00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:44.648
So even though you are gaining
fitness through changes in one

00:07:44.648 --> 00:07:46.096
trait,
almost inevitably,

00:07:46.096 --> 00:07:49.238
whatever you change is going to
cause a decrease in fitness in

00:07:49.238 --> 00:07:52.930
some other trait,
and this forces compromises.

00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:55.966
So the intrinsic factors then
can be looked into,

00:07:55.966 --> 00:07:59.447
and we find phylogenetic
effects, developmental effects,

00:07:59.447 --> 00:08:02.170
genetic effects,
physiological effects;

00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:04.139
all sorts of things.
 

00:08:04.139 --> 00:08:07.500
Tradeoffs in a evolutionary
situation are often

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:10.790
conceptualized as being strictly
energetic.

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:15.449
If I take calories away from my
growth in order to reproduce and

00:08:15.449 --> 00:08:18.343
make more babies,
then I won't be so big next

00:08:18.343 --> 00:08:20.860
year and I can't have so many
babies next year.

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:23.656
That would be kind of a
standard physiological story

00:08:23.656 --> 00:08:24.699
about a tradeoff.
 

00:08:24.699 --> 00:08:27.009
But they can also occur in many
other ways.

00:08:27.009 --> 00:08:29.199
So that would be a
physiological story.

00:08:29.199 --> 00:08:31.793
But certainly there are
developmental and genetic

00:08:31.793 --> 00:08:33.629
influences on tradeoffs as well.
 

00:08:33.629 --> 00:08:38.504
So there's a lot of biology
that's hiding behind these

00:08:38.504 --> 00:08:42.460
simple summary statements,
on this slide.

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:45.700
In the rest of the lecture I'm
just going to show you how to

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:48.172
explain age and size at
maturity, reproductive

00:08:48.172 --> 00:08:50.149
investment, and aging and death.
 

00:08:50.149 --> 00:08:51.399
So, not too much.
 

00:08:54.970 --> 00:08:59.538
This is kind of a standard
statement out of life history

00:08:59.538 --> 00:09:02.190
theory,
and this generic statement

00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:06.528
could be applied to clutch size
and lifespan and a lot of other

00:09:06.528 --> 00:09:07.230
things.
 

00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:09.298
But let's just look at age and
size at maturity.

00:09:09.298 --> 00:09:12.578
They will be optimal when the
positive difference between the

00:09:12.578 --> 00:09:15.014
benefits and the costs--
so the difference between the

00:09:15.014 --> 00:09:17.690
benefits and the costs--
is maximized.

00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:21.216
And we can conceive of that as
either being maximized just at a

00:09:21.216 --> 00:09:23.980
stable equilibrium point--
that's kind of a simple

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:26.168
statement, that's a theoretical
statement;

00:09:26.168 --> 00:09:29.144
so that would be,
okay, everybody in this

00:09:29.144 --> 00:09:33.160
species, they ought to mature at
just one age and size,

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:35.690
which is a little unrealistic.
 

00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:40.107
Or we can use that kind of
analysis to predict a stable

00:09:40.107 --> 00:09:42.399
equilibrium reaction norm.
 

00:09:42.399 --> 00:09:45.845
So here we're beginning to use
this idea that we got of a

00:09:45.845 --> 00:09:46.830
reaction norm.
 

00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:52.558
And that one summarizes pretty
easily.

00:09:52.558 --> 00:09:55.198
You're going to--whatever
problem you're faced with,

00:09:55.198 --> 00:09:58.355
you're going to mature at the
age and size where the payoff in

00:09:58.355 --> 00:10:00.220
fitness is going to be greatest.
 

00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:04.769
The problem analytically is to
decide what you have to bring in

00:10:04.769 --> 00:10:07.999
to the mix in order to
successfully make that

00:10:07.999 --> 00:10:09.100
prediction.
 

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:12.649
You want to keep it as simple
as possible, because it can get

00:10:12.649 --> 00:10:14.778
very complex,
but you want to keep it

00:10:14.778 --> 00:10:17.559
realistic enough to actually be
successful.

00:10:17.559 --> 00:10:18.840
So it's a balancing act.
 

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:27.058
Now with--I'm going to show you
one way to do this.

00:10:27.058 --> 00:10:32.018
If we make four general
assumptions, we can predict age

00:10:32.018 --> 00:10:34.129
and size at maturity.
 

00:10:34.129 --> 00:10:35.700
Here they are.
 

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:38.889
The first one is that if you're
older when you first reproduce,

00:10:38.889 --> 00:10:42.769
your offspring are going to
have better survival rates,

00:10:42.769 --> 00:10:47.254
they will be of higher quality;
so one reason to wait is that

00:10:47.254 --> 00:10:50.168
you get higher quality
offspring.

00:10:50.168 --> 00:10:54.998
Another reason to wait is that
because you've been growing for

00:10:54.998 --> 00:10:56.923
longer,
you've taken longer to grow

00:10:56.923 --> 00:11:00.529
before you start to reproduce,
you can have more of them,

00:11:00.529 --> 00:11:04.399
because you're bigger;
especially important in plants

00:11:04.399 --> 00:11:05.210
and in fish.
 

00:11:08.259 --> 00:11:11.708
However, these advantages of
delaying maturity are

00:11:11.708 --> 00:11:15.441
counter-balanced by the
advantages of having a shorter

00:11:15.441 --> 00:11:18.350
generation time,
and you can only get a shorter

00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:20.210
generation time if you mature
earlier.

00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:22.230
Let me just illustrate the
advantage of a shorter

00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:22.990
generation time.
 

00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:25.278
I give you a hundred bucks and
I tell you you can invest it in

00:11:25.278 --> 00:11:27.678
a bank that's going to give you
compound interest once a day,

00:11:27.678 --> 00:11:29.922
on the one hand,
or once a year,

00:11:29.922 --> 00:11:31.370
on the other hand.
 

00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:33.418
You all know the advantages of
compound interest;

00:11:33.418 --> 00:11:34.960
you get interest on your
interest.

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:36.629
Right?
 

00:11:36.629 --> 00:11:39.450
A shorter generation time is
the bank that gives you interest

00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:42.289
earlier;
you get grandchildren quicker.

00:11:42.289 --> 00:11:44.360
Okay?
 

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:49.312
So that is basically the
elements that you need to put

00:11:49.312 --> 00:11:52.210
into a quantitative tradeoff.
 

00:11:52.210 --> 00:11:56.330
Delaying, you can get higher
quality, or more offspring;

00:11:56.330 --> 00:11:59.214
doing it quicker,
you're going to get a shorter

00:11:59.214 --> 00:12:01.658
generation time and a quicker
payoff.

00:12:01.658 --> 00:12:05.850
Now in a population that's at
evolutionary equilibrium,

00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:09.730
these advantages and
disadvantages should have come

00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:11.048
into balance.
 

00:12:11.048 --> 00:12:14.230
So let's see how that might
work.

00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:15.580
Here's a simple example.
 

00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:18.558
This is using data from the
Western Fence Lizard,

00:12:18.558 --> 00:12:21.870
and what you're looking at
here, this plot here,

00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:23.769
where you see these curves
going up and down,

00:12:23.769 --> 00:12:25.168
that's a fitness profile.
 

00:12:25.168 --> 00:12:28.668
So we have some kind of trait
along the y-axis;

00:12:28.668 --> 00:12:33.029
in this case it's age of
maturity--along the x-axis.

00:12:33.029 --> 00:12:35.480
Along the y-axis we have
relative fitness;

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:40.256
so this is the rate at which a
population of organisms with

00:12:40.256 --> 00:12:44.789
that age at maturity would grow,
given what we know about the

00:12:44.789 --> 00:12:47.678
physiology and mortality rates
of fence lizards.

00:12:47.678 --> 00:12:53.029
And if we just put in one of
those assumptions,

00:12:53.029 --> 00:12:56.889
which is that the bigger they
are the more babies they have --

00:12:56.889 --> 00:12:59.230
so their fecundity grows
linearly with size --

00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:04.308
their optimal age at maturity
is just about twelve months.

00:13:04.308 --> 00:13:09.514
If we put in that if they get
higher quality offspring as they

00:13:09.514 --> 00:13:12.846
delay maturity,
given the assumptions in the

00:13:12.846 --> 00:13:15.380
model,
we predict actually that they

00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:18.308
ought to be maturing at about
six months.

00:13:18.308 --> 00:13:20.340
Their observed age at maturity
is ten months.

00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:24.179
That indicates that this effect
is probably important and

00:13:24.179 --> 00:13:26.168
perhaps accurately modeled.
 

00:13:26.168 --> 00:13:29.052
This number tells us that well
perhaps we don't really

00:13:29.052 --> 00:13:31.610
understand what makes for a good
baby lizard.

00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:32.678
Okay?
 

00:13:32.678 --> 00:13:37.182
And you can see that
interestingly the age at

00:13:37.182 --> 00:13:40.970
maturity is pretty strongly
peaked;

00:13:40.970 --> 00:13:45.922
the fitness profile has a peak
that's pretty close to one

00:13:45.922 --> 00:13:46.629
value.
 

00:13:46.629 --> 00:13:48.878
That means there's pretty
strong selection operating on

00:13:48.878 --> 00:13:49.169
this.
 

00:13:49.169 --> 00:13:50.759
It's not flat.
 

00:13:50.759 --> 00:13:54.047
Now if you repeat that kind of
thing--and by the way,

00:13:54.047 --> 00:13:56.450
there's a bunch of math behind
that;

00:13:56.450 --> 00:14:00.769
I'm just waving my hands and
covering up that black box.

00:14:00.769 --> 00:14:04.895
If you repeat that for a bunch
of fish species that are growing

00:14:04.895 --> 00:14:07.691
in different kinds of
conditions--these are

00:14:07.691 --> 00:14:10.620
haplochromine cichlids in Lake
Victoria;

00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:12.519
the painted greenling lives in
Seattle;

00:14:12.519 --> 00:14:16.320
these roaches are living in
Greece--and these are all cases

00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:20.187
in which very good population
biology has been done for long

00:14:20.187 --> 00:14:22.350
periods of time in the field.
 

00:14:22.350 --> 00:14:24.412
So we know growth rates and
mortality rates,

00:14:24.412 --> 00:14:26.379
and we have some estimate of
tradeoffs.

00:14:26.379 --> 00:14:30.644
Then that kind of thinking says
this is the predicted age at

00:14:30.644 --> 00:14:34.187
maturity and this is the
observed age of maturity,

00:14:34.187 --> 00:14:36.428
and the correlation is .93.
 

00:14:36.428 --> 00:14:40.812
So it looks like that way of
thinking is capturing something

00:14:40.812 --> 00:14:45.269
that is not a bad reflection of
what's going on in Nature.

00:14:45.269 --> 00:14:47.476
This sort of result doesn't
mean you've got the right

00:14:47.476 --> 00:14:47.860
answer.
 

00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:50.272
You can have the right answer
for the wrong reason,

00:14:50.272 --> 00:14:52.057
because this is just
descriptive work,

00:14:52.057 --> 00:14:54.470
this is not a manipulative
experimental study.

00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:59.240
We'll see such an experimental
study later on.

00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:04.120
However, that's not the whole
story.

00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:07.950
I now want to extend that to
the case when growth rates vary,

00:15:07.950 --> 00:15:11.134
and I want to introduce you to
the idea that age and size at

00:15:11.134 --> 00:15:13.080
maturity can have a reaction
norm.

00:15:16.558 --> 00:15:20.813
And the way I want to do that
is by dealing with some

00:15:20.813 --> 00:15:23.759
incredibly blockheaded
strategies.

00:15:23.759 --> 00:15:25.110
Okay?
 

00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:27.320
So here we have rapid growth.
 

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:30.532
So this is an organism that is
born down here,

00:15:30.532 --> 00:15:33.460
and it's well fed and it grows
rapidly.

00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:36.860
So it gains weight well,
reaches a large size.

00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:40.830
And this is an organism that
grows slowly;

00:15:40.830 --> 00:15:44.690
it's under food restriction,
down here.

00:15:44.690 --> 00:15:48.912
Now let's take the blue
strategy--this is a very,

00:15:48.912 --> 00:15:53.750
very simple one--and what it
says is I'm always going to

00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:56.389
mature at the same weight.
 

00:15:56.389 --> 00:16:00.259
If that organism is growing
rapidly,

00:16:00.259 --> 00:16:04.921
it matures at a pretty early
age, but if it's growing slowly

00:16:04.921 --> 00:16:09.131
and it adheres to this rule,
it has to wait a long time

00:16:09.131 --> 00:16:12.657
until it matures,
and its problem here is that it

00:16:12.657 --> 00:16:14.750
might die before it matures.
 

00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:18.460
So that strategy has the cost
of mortality.

00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:22.087
On the other hand,
if it's always the same age

00:16:22.087 --> 00:16:25.246
when it matures,
under good circumstances,

00:16:25.246 --> 00:16:28.221
it's doing okay,
but under poor circumstances

00:16:28.221 --> 00:16:31.432
it's much smaller,
and therefore it can have fewer

00:16:31.432 --> 00:16:31.928
babies.
 

00:16:31.928 --> 00:16:34.200
And so the problem here is
fecundity;

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:37.558
it's going to not have as many
babies if it does that.

00:16:37.558 --> 00:16:41.648
And so just intuitively you
might think that there is some

00:16:41.648 --> 00:16:46.167
kind of intermediate compromise
so that when it is not being fed

00:16:46.167 --> 00:16:49.158
as much,
it changes both its age at

00:16:49.158 --> 00:16:51.928
maturity and its size at
maturity.

00:16:51.928 --> 00:16:55.669
And, in fact,
this kind of thing can be

00:16:55.669 --> 00:16:56.950
calculated.
 

00:16:56.950 --> 00:16:59.993
This is an optimal reaction
norm for age and size at

00:16:59.993 --> 00:17:00.649
maturity.
 

00:17:00.649 --> 00:17:02.750
They don't all look like this.
 

00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:03.480
Okay?
 

00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:07.768
This is a common one,
but there are conditions under

00:17:07.768 --> 00:17:10.880
which you can make this thing
bend.

00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:14.102
You can actually sometimes get
them so that they go up like

00:17:14.102 --> 00:17:16.380
this, under very special
circumstances.

00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:18.088
It depends on a bunch of stuff.
 

00:17:18.088 --> 00:17:20.328
I don't want to trouble you
with the complexities.

00:17:20.328 --> 00:17:24.871
I just want you to take home
the message that you can predict

00:17:24.871 --> 00:17:29.109
what the plastic flexible
response should be if evolution

00:17:29.109 --> 00:17:31.230
has come to equilibrium.
 

00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:34.498
And for this one,
basically what this graph is

00:17:34.498 --> 00:17:38.202
telling you is this--this is the
reaction norm here,

00:17:38.202 --> 00:17:41.950
these are growth curves here;
so this is good conditions,

00:17:41.950 --> 00:17:44.602
this is poor conditions--
and what this picture is

00:17:44.602 --> 00:17:46.630
telling is that when life is
good,

00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:50.160
you should mature when you are
young and big,

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:53.008
and when life is bad,
you should mature when you're

00:17:53.008 --> 00:17:53.920
old and small.
 

00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:55.450
Okay?
 

00:17:55.450 --> 00:17:59.210
That's the English take-home
message, out of that picture.

00:17:59.210 --> 00:18:04.700
Well when Nile perch were
introduced to Lake Victoria,

00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:06.960
there hadn't been any Nile
perch in there before,

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:09.588
and they went bananas and ate
their way around the lake--

00:18:09.588 --> 00:18:12.615
and in the process,
by the way, they probably drove

00:18:12.615 --> 00:18:15.578
about 200 haplochromine species
to extinction--

00:18:15.578 --> 00:18:18.756
but while they going through
their initial population burst

00:18:18.756 --> 00:18:22.038
and they had a lot of food,
they were about six feet long.

00:18:22.038 --> 00:18:24.160
This is the business end of a
Nile perch.

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:25.838
You can see it's a big fish.
 

00:18:25.838 --> 00:18:29.048
After they had expanded in the
lake,

00:18:29.048 --> 00:18:31.778
which occurred between 1976 and
1979,

00:18:31.778 --> 00:18:36.140
they ate down the population of
their prey,

00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:40.848
there wasn't as much food and
they didn't grow as well,

00:18:40.848 --> 00:18:43.200
and they slid down this
reaction norm,

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:45.318
and now instead of being six
feet long,

00:18:45.318 --> 00:18:48.500
the Nile perch in Lake Victoria
are about that big.

00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:51.932
They still form a fishery and
people are still making money on

00:18:51.932 --> 00:18:55.029
selling Nile perch fillets,
but they're much smaller.

00:18:55.029 --> 00:18:57.720
And that was a predictable
thing.

00:18:57.720 --> 00:18:59.808
Okay?
 

00:18:59.808 --> 00:19:06.250
And this will happen whenever
population densities change.

00:19:10.038 --> 00:19:14.633
Back in the 1930s and 1940s,
there was a huge sardine

00:19:14.633 --> 00:19:17.990
fishery off the coast of
California.

00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:22.048
John Steinbeck wrote novels
about it, short stories.

00:19:22.048 --> 00:19:25.125
There's a book called
Cannery Row that talks

00:19:25.125 --> 00:19:27.769
about the Monterey Bay sardine
canneries.

00:19:27.769 --> 00:19:31.058
In the 1950s that fishery
collapsed,

00:19:31.058 --> 00:19:33.483
not because of over-fishing,
but because of changes in the

00:19:33.483 --> 00:19:35.910
oceanic conditions where the
baby fish were growing up.

00:19:35.910 --> 00:19:40.141
At the time that it collapsed,
there were sardines that had

00:19:40.141 --> 00:19:44.298
been born under better
conditions and started to grow,

00:19:44.298 --> 00:19:48.029
and then all the competition
went away;

00:19:48.029 --> 00:19:50.538
nobody else came along because
all the baby sardines were

00:19:50.538 --> 00:19:52.868
getting killed by bad conditions
out in the ocean.

00:19:52.868 --> 00:19:56.582
Just before the fishery folded
and there were no longer enough

00:19:56.582 --> 00:19:59.599
sardines to catch,
the fishermen in Monterey were

00:19:59.599 --> 00:20:02.558
catching female sardines that
were one meter long.

00:20:02.558 --> 00:20:07.528
So they had gone in the other
direction, they'd gone up the

00:20:07.528 --> 00:20:08.900
reaction norm.
 

00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:13.058
These things are predictable as
population density changes.

00:20:13.058 --> 00:20:15.108
I'd like to give you one more
example,

00:20:15.108 --> 00:20:18.692
and it has to do with the issue
of whether or not the mammals

00:20:18.692 --> 00:20:21.740
died out because of bad weather,
or over-hunting.

00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:24.382
Dan Fisher, who's a
paleontologist at the University

00:20:24.382 --> 00:20:27.078
of Michigan,
has recovered a lot of mammoth

00:20:27.078 --> 00:20:30.854
bones from a Native American
mammoth slaughterhouse that was

00:20:30.854 --> 00:20:32.390
outside of Ann Arbor.
 

00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:34.230
They used to kill the mammoths
and then store them under ice,

00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:36.622
in a lake, over the winter,
so that the other predators

00:20:36.622 --> 00:20:39.141
wouldn't get the meat,
and there are a lot of mammoth

00:20:39.141 --> 00:20:40.598
bones very close to Ann Arbor.
 

00:20:40.598 --> 00:20:44.078
And you can ask yourself--when
you look at a mammoth bone,

00:20:44.078 --> 00:20:47.280
you can tell how big the
mammoth was and whether or not

00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:49.574
it is mature,
because the bones of all

00:20:49.574 --> 00:20:52.430
mammals undergo a change when
they reach maturity.

00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:57.558
Now if it was bad weather,
then they would've been growing

00:20:57.558 --> 00:21:00.278
slowly,
and they should've been small

00:21:00.278 --> 00:21:03.890
and older when they matured,
according to the reaction norm.

00:21:03.890 --> 00:21:07.115
If it was hunting,
then just like the California

00:21:07.115 --> 00:21:09.557
sardine,
when the population density

00:21:09.557 --> 00:21:12.118
drops, each individual has more
to eat,

00:21:12.118 --> 00:21:16.970
and they should have been big
and young when they matured.

00:21:16.970 --> 00:21:22.380
Do you think they were old and
small, or big and young?

00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:24.200
How many for old and small;
bad weather?

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:26.588
A few.
 

00:21:26.588 --> 00:21:29.180
How many for young and large;
hunting?

00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:31.348
Most people believe the
over-kill hypothesis.

00:21:31.348 --> 00:21:34.647
Yes, they were young and large,
and some of them had arrow

00:21:34.647 --> 00:21:36.500
points embedded in their ribs.
 

00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:42.058
So you can use that for various
things.

00:21:42.058 --> 00:21:46.890
This is what that model tells
us about human females.

00:21:46.890 --> 00:21:50.108
These are some pretty
theoretical growth curves for

00:21:50.108 --> 00:21:53.263
human females under poor
conditions and under good

00:21:53.263 --> 00:21:54.230
conditions.
 

00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:59.701
We actually have data on how
female age and size at maturity

00:21:59.701 --> 00:22:01.000
has changed.
 

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:07.519
There are measurements on women
working in industrial squalor in

00:22:07.519 --> 00:22:10.893
North England,
in the nineteenth century,

00:22:10.893 --> 00:22:14.366
and there are good records
measured on Hutterite colonies

00:22:14.366 --> 00:22:17.160
in North America in the
twentieth century.

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:19.140
The nineteenth century women
were poorly nourished.

00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:21.380
The twentieth century women
were well nourished.

00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:23.858
They moved right up a reaction
norm.

00:22:23.858 --> 00:22:26.259
They got younger and bigger
when they matured;

00:22:26.259 --> 00:22:28.150
and it was about four year's
difference.

00:22:28.150 --> 00:22:31.468
So they went--there are various
measures of when a woman

00:22:31.468 --> 00:22:35.390
is--physiological measures--but
they kind of all move together.

00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:39.565
So it's about a four-year
advance, earlier maturity in the

00:22:39.565 --> 00:22:41.029
twentieth century.
 

00:22:41.029 --> 00:22:44.421
And this other line here
illustrates another point that I

00:22:44.421 --> 00:22:46.480
want you to take away from this.
 

00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:51.923
If modern medicine were to keep
juvenile mortality rates as low

00:22:51.923 --> 00:22:56.493
as it currently does,
then it would cause a further

00:22:56.493 --> 00:22:59.640
shift in age at maturity in
humans,

00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:02.348
and that shift is represented
here.

00:23:02.348 --> 00:23:05.191
This probably would take
somewhere around 5 or 10,000

00:23:05.191 --> 00:23:06.118
years to occur.
 

00:23:06.118 --> 00:23:08.759
This is the evolutionary
genetic response;

00:23:08.759 --> 00:23:12.167
this is the immediate
developmental response to better

00:23:12.167 --> 00:23:14.542
nutrition;
and this is the evolutionary

00:23:14.542 --> 00:23:17.750
genetic response to a drop in
juvenile mortality rates.

00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:21.490
The whole reaction norm evolves;
it will move up and down.

00:23:21.490 --> 00:23:26.936
It's embodying an evolutionary
set of rules of thumb,

00:23:26.936 --> 00:23:31.442
contingent decisions--if I'm
well nourished,

00:23:31.442 --> 00:23:34.082
do this;
if I'm poorly nourished do

00:23:34.082 --> 00:23:35.730
that--and those things evolve.
 

00:23:39.068 --> 00:23:43.323
Okay, now the second major life
history trait is once you've

00:23:43.323 --> 00:23:47.503
matured how many babies should
you have, and how big should

00:23:47.503 --> 00:23:48.368
they be?
 

00:23:48.368 --> 00:23:51.590
You want to be an orchid with
billions of tiny ones,

00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:54.368
or you want to be a kiwi with
one big one?

00:23:54.368 --> 00:23:57.710
Well the ideas on this go back
to David Lack.

00:23:57.710 --> 00:24:02.528
David Lack was the man who more
or less created the idea of

00:24:02.528 --> 00:24:05.519
Darwin's finches in the
Galapagos.

00:24:05.519 --> 00:24:07.664
Darwin's finches,
as a concept,

00:24:07.664 --> 00:24:10.670
emerged in the middle twentieth
century.

00:24:10.670 --> 00:24:14.277
They were never called Darwin's
finches before David Lack went

00:24:14.277 --> 00:24:16.191
to the Galapagos,
studied them,

00:24:16.191 --> 00:24:19.509
came back and wrote a book
called Darwin's Finches.

00:24:19.509 --> 00:24:24.858
It was 120 years after Darwin
had been there.

00:24:24.858 --> 00:24:28.810
And he went on to become head
of the Edward Gray Institute at

00:24:28.810 --> 00:24:30.961
Oxford,
which is an ornithological

00:24:30.961 --> 00:24:34.230
institute and one of the best
places in the world to go if

00:24:34.230 --> 00:24:37.384
you're interested in bird
biology and you're not working

00:24:37.384 --> 00:24:38.990
with Rick Prum at Yale.
 

00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:43.890
So what David said basically
was this.

00:24:43.890 --> 00:24:47.432
If nestling survival decreases
as clutch size increases,

00:24:47.432 --> 00:24:50.782
then an intermediate number of
eggs produces the most

00:24:50.782 --> 00:24:51.750
fledglings.
 

00:24:51.750 --> 00:24:54.029
The idea behind that was this.
 

00:24:54.029 --> 00:24:57.660
If you make too many babies,
you won't be able to feed them.

00:24:57.660 --> 00:25:00.740
There are only so many hours in
the day.

00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:04.263
You might be able to work as
hard as possible and not bring

00:25:04.263 --> 00:25:07.788
off a clutch of say ten babies,
but you could do quite well

00:25:07.788 --> 00:25:08.640
with five.
 

00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:12.769
Now I'm going to show you that
he was wrong on the details,

00:25:12.769 --> 00:25:15.997
but he got the main point,
which is that fitness is often

00:25:15.997 --> 00:25:19.108
maximized at intermediate
reproductive investments,

00:25:19.108 --> 00:25:22.556
particularly in organisms that
reproduce more than once per

00:25:22.556 --> 00:25:23.210
lifetime.
 

00:25:23.210 --> 00:25:25.900
You don't do it all now,
you hold some back,

00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:29.028
and you actually do better if
you spread it out.

00:25:29.028 --> 00:25:34.440
So if we then take Lack's idea,
and we make a simple model out

00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:38.519
of it--basically what he was
saying is this.

00:25:38.519 --> 00:25:42.500
As clutch size goes up,
well that just means that eggs

00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:46.931
go up, but if survival goes
down, as eggs go up--this is the

00:25:46.931 --> 00:25:50.827
per egg survival probability;
basically this is saying that

00:25:50.827 --> 00:25:53.515
if you only laid one egg,
you'd have very good survival,

00:25:53.515 --> 00:25:55.470
and if you lay ten eggs they
all die.

00:26:00.778 --> 00:26:04.980
You can turn that into an
equation for how many fledglings

00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:07.930
do you get for a given number of
eggs?

00:26:07.930 --> 00:26:11.108
Well it's going to be 1 minus a
constant,

00:26:11.108 --> 00:26:13.640
times the number of eggs you
lay, which means,

00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:17.019
if you multiply that out,
that you've got a quadratic

00:26:17.019 --> 00:26:20.096
term here in eggs;
and that is what leads to the

00:26:20.096 --> 00:26:22.603
parabola,
it's this quadratic term that

00:26:22.603 --> 00:26:24.880
means that as clutch size goes
up,

00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:28.778
the number of babies that you
get out of it has a parabolic

00:26:28.778 --> 00:26:31.200
form with an intermediate
optimum.

00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:33.818
And you then just do the
standard basic calculus thing of

00:26:33.818 --> 00:26:36.440
taking the first derivative,
setting it equal to zero.

00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:41.130
It tells you that this point
right here is going to be at

00:26:41.130 --> 00:26:43.153
1/2C,
in this equation,

00:26:43.153 --> 00:26:46.575
and if C is 0.1,
this optimal number of eggs

00:26:46.575 --> 00:26:49.001
will be 5,
and the number of fledglings

00:26:49.001 --> 00:26:50.690
that you get out of it will be
2.5.

00:26:50.690 --> 00:26:56.150
Of course, you never get 2.5,
but that's just because the

00:26:56.150 --> 00:27:01.220
model's continuous and the eggs
are discontinuous.

00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:05.557
Well if this is the case,
if birds are laying the optimal

00:27:05.557 --> 00:27:10.049
clutch, then a larger or a
smaller clutch should have lower

00:27:10.049 --> 00:27:10.980
fitness.
 

00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:15.198
Basically all we're saying is
that if we were able to take a

00:27:15.198 --> 00:27:17.423
bird,
and she wants to do this,

00:27:17.423 --> 00:27:21.460
but we give her either fewer
eggs or we give her more eggs,

00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:23.920
then she should have lower
fitness.

00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:26.670
This should be the best,
which she naturally does,

00:27:26.670 --> 00:27:29.589
and we perturb that,
she should have less fitness.

00:27:33.318 --> 00:27:37.124
This was done on kestrels in
the Netherlands by Dutch

00:27:37.124 --> 00:27:40.269
ecologists, in a rather
remarkable study.

00:27:40.269 --> 00:27:45.490
A kestrel is a sparrow hawk,
and these animals live,

00:27:45.490 --> 00:27:47.920
these birds live for several
years,

00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:51.799
and the Dutch ecologists
actually followed them long

00:27:51.799 --> 00:27:54.539
enough to count the
grandchildren;

00:27:54.539 --> 00:27:56.000
they went three generations.
 

00:28:02.460 --> 00:28:06.048
So, this is the setup.
 

00:28:06.048 --> 00:28:09.010
They reduced the size of 28
clutches, enlarged the size of

00:28:09.010 --> 00:28:12.180
20 clutches, and in 54 clutches
they took the eggs out and put

00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:15.210
them back again;
those were the controls.

00:28:15.210 --> 00:28:20.018
And if you just look at this,
it looks like these birds

00:28:20.018 --> 00:28:24.366
should be laying more eggs,
because if you look over at the

00:28:24.366 --> 00:28:28.233
enlarged clutches,
they've been able to change the

00:28:28.233 --> 00:28:30.210
brood size up by 2.5.
 

00:28:30.210 --> 00:28:32.460
They've been able to get more
fledglings out--

00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:36.576
they've gotten nearly two more
fledglings out of the enlarged

00:28:36.576 --> 00:28:39.140
clutches--
and the reproductive value of

00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:42.612
that clutch,
which is how many grandchildren

00:28:42.612 --> 00:28:46.009
do I get out of that clutch,
is higher.

00:28:46.009 --> 00:28:49.016
So it looks like these birds
are blockheaded,

00:28:49.016 --> 00:28:51.338
they should be laying more
eggs.

00:28:51.338 --> 00:28:54.769
But that's only looking at what
happens that season.

00:28:54.769 --> 00:28:58.843
While they were examining these
birds, one of them,

00:28:58.843 --> 00:29:01.531
Serge Daan is a good
physiologist,

00:29:01.531 --> 00:29:06.338
and so he did the experiment
with doubly labeled water.

00:29:06.338 --> 00:29:09.218
He wanted to find out how hard
the birds would work,

00:29:09.218 --> 00:29:11.420
and they were coming into nest
boxes.

00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:14.960
So mommy and daddy kestrel fly
into a nest box with food for

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:16.440
baby;
evil Dutch ecologist,

00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:19.470
sitting in back of the nest
box, takes food away from baby.

00:29:19.470 --> 00:29:20.278
Baby cries.
 

00:29:20.278 --> 00:29:22.690
Baby gets hungry,
mommy and daddy work harder.

00:29:22.690 --> 00:29:24.868
Evil Dutch ecologist takes away
food.

00:29:24.868 --> 00:29:26.470
Mommy and daddy work even
harder.

00:29:26.470 --> 00:29:28.078
How hard do mommy and daddy
work?

00:29:28.078 --> 00:29:30.990
Mommy and daddy work about
eight hours that day--

00:29:30.990 --> 00:29:33.679
daylight's about sixteen hours
a day in the summer in North

00:29:33.679 --> 00:29:35.881
Holland--
and they hit a rate of

00:29:35.881 --> 00:29:39.878
physiological output which is
nearly four times basal

00:29:39.878 --> 00:29:43.069
metabolic rate,
which is what Lance Armstrong

00:29:43.069 --> 00:29:46.353
puts out on the Alpe d'Huez in
the middle of the Tour de

00:29:46.353 --> 00:29:46.950
France.
 

00:29:46.950 --> 00:29:50.622
So the Dutch ecologists
basically forced these birds to

00:29:50.622 --> 00:29:53.750
work as hard as a peak human
athlete would,

00:29:53.750 --> 00:29:56.059
and then they quit after eight
hours,

00:29:56.059 --> 00:29:58.240
because they didn't want to die.
 

00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:02.970
And then the Dutch ecologists
gave the babies their food.

00:30:02.970 --> 00:30:05.819
Just so you don't have
nightmares about that.

00:30:05.819 --> 00:30:07.568
Okay?
 

00:30:07.568 --> 00:30:12.088
So that introduces parental
survival.

00:30:12.088 --> 00:30:16.828
If you increase the clutch
size, the parents died the next

00:30:16.828 --> 00:30:21.319
winter at a higher rate,
because they worked harder.

00:30:21.319 --> 00:30:23.548
Okay?
 

00:30:23.548 --> 00:30:27.478
And if you add all of that up,
the residual reproductive value

00:30:27.478 --> 00:30:30.875
of the rest of their lifetime;
the number of grandchildren

00:30:30.875 --> 00:30:33.794
they would get out of the rest
of their lifetime was highest

00:30:33.794 --> 00:30:36.196
for the reduced broods,
intermediate for the control

00:30:36.196 --> 00:30:38.055
broods,
and strikingly lower for the

00:30:38.055 --> 00:30:40.470
enlarged broods,
because of this effect.

00:30:40.470 --> 00:30:43.348
If you die before the next
year, you get zero babies next

00:30:43.348 --> 00:30:43.710
year.
 

00:30:43.710 --> 00:30:46.848
So if you look at their total
reproductive value,

00:30:46.848 --> 00:30:48.868
which is the value they got
this year,

00:30:48.868 --> 00:30:51.150
plus the value they got in the
rest of their life,

00:30:51.150 --> 00:30:53.318
it's highest for the control
group,

00:30:53.318 --> 00:30:55.630
and if their clutches were
enlarged,

00:30:55.630 --> 00:30:59.029
they had one grandchild less,
and if their clutches were

00:30:59.029 --> 00:31:01.347
reduced,
they had a half a grandchild

00:31:01.347 --> 00:31:01.700
less.
 

00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:03.930
Which has an interesting
take-home message.

00:31:03.930 --> 00:31:09.480
These Dutch kestrels know
what's best for them.

00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:11.349
They lay the right number of
eggs.

00:31:11.349 --> 00:31:15.450
That's the control group.
 

00:31:15.450 --> 00:31:18.487
So the take-home points
basically are that what's going

00:31:18.487 --> 00:31:21.806
on here is that clutch size is
trading off with an important

00:31:21.806 --> 00:31:24.568
fitness component,
but it's not fledgling

00:31:24.568 --> 00:31:26.838
survival, it's parental
survival.

00:31:26.838 --> 00:31:30.140
In this case--it's different in
other species--

00:31:30.140 --> 00:31:33.038
but in this case the reason
that they don't lay more eggs is

00:31:33.038 --> 00:31:35.298
that they themselves are more
likely to die;

00:31:35.298 --> 00:31:37.838
not that their offspring are
more likely to die.

00:31:37.838 --> 00:31:40.678
And these kestrels are
optimizing their reproductive

00:31:40.678 --> 00:31:43.740
investment with a clutch that's
of intermediate size.

00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:45.420
They could lay more eggs but
they don't.

00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:47.720
They know how many to lay.
 

00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:53.440
Okay, so that's just one
example of clutch size analysis.

00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:55.833
It's a big literature,
there's a lot of experiments on

00:31:55.833 --> 00:31:56.150
this.
 

00:31:56.150 --> 00:31:58.108
Now let's go to lifespan.
 

00:31:58.108 --> 00:32:02.900
So I'm taking you through the
major life history traits from

00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:05.578
birth to reproduction to death.
 

00:32:05.578 --> 00:32:08.842
In Fragment of an Agon,
T.S. Eliot wrote,

00:32:08.842 --> 00:32:11.618
"Birth,
reproduction and death.

00:32:11.618 --> 00:32:13.999
That's all the facts,
when you come to brass tacks,

00:32:13.999 --> 00:32:15.950
birth and reproduction and
death."

00:32:15.950 --> 00:32:17.900
He wrote that in the 1930s I
think.

00:32:17.900 --> 00:32:21.306
I didn't realize that
T.S. Eliot was a behavioral

00:32:21.306 --> 00:32:24.000
ecologist;
evidently he was.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:28.618
So reproductive lifespan,
under this kind of analysis,

00:32:28.618 --> 00:32:31.777
is a balance between selection
that increases the number of

00:32:31.777 --> 00:32:34.244
reproductive events per life--
you live longer,

00:32:34.244 --> 00:32:37.396
you can reproduce more--
and effects that increase the

00:32:37.396 --> 00:32:40.250
intrinsic sources of mortality
with age.

00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:47.691
And it's this idea that there's
an evolution of aging or of

00:32:47.691 --> 00:32:51.111
senescence;
there's an evolution of the

00:32:51.111 --> 00:32:54.159
body falling apart,
as a byproduct of something,

00:32:54.159 --> 00:32:57.530
which is the key feature of
this part of life history

00:32:57.530 --> 00:32:58.308
theory.
 

00:32:58.308 --> 00:33:02.638
So the first kinds of selection
pressures are going to lengthen

00:33:02.638 --> 00:33:06.269
life to give you more
reproductive opportunities,

00:33:06.269 --> 00:33:10.105
but if there are byproducts
that are causing intrinsic

00:33:10.105 --> 00:33:13.519
increases in mortality rate,
those will shorten your

00:33:13.519 --> 00:33:14.028
lifespan.
 

00:33:14.028 --> 00:33:15.450
So these things then come into
some kind of balance.

00:33:19.088 --> 00:33:21.718
Any increase in intrinsic
mortality rates,

00:33:21.718 --> 00:33:24.410
or decrease in reproductive
rates with age,

00:33:24.410 --> 00:33:26.588
is called aging or senescence.
 

00:33:26.588 --> 00:33:29.875
So now we're talking about why
people fall apart when they get

00:33:29.875 --> 00:33:31.868
old, and why organisms age and
die.

00:33:31.868 --> 00:33:37.344
To do that I need to introduce
you first to the way selection

00:33:37.344 --> 00:33:39.990
operates at different ages.
 

00:33:39.990 --> 00:33:45.700
Selection is quite age specific
in its impact.

00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:49.032
Any selection pressure that
lengthens life is going to be

00:33:49.032 --> 00:33:52.426
one that decreases the relative
contribution to fitness of

00:33:52.426 --> 00:33:56.019
offspring,
and increases that of adults.

00:33:56.019 --> 00:34:01.900
So if an adult has survived to
some intermediate age,

00:34:01.900 --> 00:34:06.380
and juvenile mortality in that
species is pretty high,

00:34:06.380 --> 00:34:10.262
then the adult represents a
relatively improbable event

00:34:10.262 --> 00:34:14.442
that's quite valuable,
and if it's making babies in

00:34:14.442 --> 00:34:17.632
that environment,
each of them has a relatively

00:34:17.632 --> 00:34:20.559
low chance of surviving to be
that big and that old,

00:34:20.559 --> 00:34:23.952
and therefore there is a
certain fitness advantage in

00:34:23.952 --> 00:34:27.018
investing in the preservation of
that adult,

00:34:27.018 --> 00:34:32.612
because it's unlikely that
you'll get another one up to

00:34:32.612 --> 00:34:33.960
that state.
 

00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:36.818
The things that will do this
are lower adult mortality rates

00:34:36.818 --> 00:34:38.659
and higher juvenile mortality
rates.

00:34:38.659 --> 00:34:42.172
So if life is relatively good
for adults and pretty risky for

00:34:42.172 --> 00:34:45.159
juveniles, and infants,
then you're going to get the

00:34:45.159 --> 00:34:47.210
evolution of a longer lifespan.
 

00:34:47.210 --> 00:34:50.293
But in contrast,
if adult mortality rates

00:34:50.293 --> 00:34:53.173
increase,
then organisms should evolve

00:34:53.173 --> 00:34:56.152
more rapid aging,
basically because there really

00:34:56.152 --> 00:34:59.516
isn't much point in maintaining
a body that's going to be dead

00:34:59.516 --> 00:35:01.059
anyway for other reasons.
 

00:35:01.059 --> 00:35:04.335
Why should I take away from my
reproduction and invest it in

00:35:04.335 --> 00:35:08.702
say disease resistance,
or running away from predators,

00:35:08.702 --> 00:35:13.420
if I'm not going to be able to
avoid them anyway?

00:35:13.420 --> 00:35:15.119
Then I should make more babies.
 

00:35:15.119 --> 00:35:17.050
Okay?
 

00:35:17.050 --> 00:35:20.139
So those are the basic ideas.
 

00:35:20.139 --> 00:35:23.864
And I'd like to illustrate a
little bit of the math behind

00:35:23.864 --> 00:35:25.889
this, with a pictorial model.
 

00:35:25.889 --> 00:35:27.380
So this is why senescence
evolves.

00:35:27.380 --> 00:35:30.335
I'm going to use the fruit fly
Drosophila as the model

00:35:30.335 --> 00:35:30.949
organism.
 

00:35:30.949 --> 00:35:33.059
We're going to start this thing
off,

00:35:33.059 --> 00:35:36.050
not when it's an egg,
but when it ecloses and is an

00:35:36.050 --> 00:35:38.664
adult,
and we're going to say that our

00:35:38.664 --> 00:35:41.409
model has no intrinsic mortality
at all.

00:35:41.409 --> 00:35:44.672
So this one doesn't age;
this is our baseline,

00:35:44.672 --> 00:35:48.599
this is what happens if an
organism doesn't age.

00:35:48.599 --> 00:35:54.132
Its risk of dying is 20% per
day, and every day it lays ten

00:35:54.132 --> 00:35:54.800
eggs.
 

00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:56.409
Okay?
 

00:35:56.409 --> 00:35:58.650
So on the first day it gets ten
eggs.

00:35:58.650 --> 00:36:01.349
On the second day 80% of them
are still around,

00:36:01.349 --> 00:36:05.601
and each of them lays ten eggs,
and on the third day 64% of the

00:36:05.601 --> 00:36:08.550
original are still around (.8
times .8),

00:36:08.550 --> 00:36:11.289
ten eggs, ta-da ta-da.
 

00:36:11.289 --> 00:36:13.579
And this thing is potentially
immortal.

00:36:13.579 --> 00:36:14.159
Okay?
 

00:36:14.159 --> 00:36:16.436
So it can just go on pumping
out the eggs,

00:36:16.436 --> 00:36:18.489
if it survives for as long as
ever;

00:36:18.489 --> 00:36:21.840
and its probability of survival
isn't changing with age,

00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:23.119
it's 80% each time.
 

00:36:23.119 --> 00:36:25.650
This one gets 50 progeny.
 

00:36:25.650 --> 00:36:28.269
We do that just by using an
infinite series.

00:36:28.269 --> 00:36:29.150
Okay?
 

00:36:29.150 --> 00:36:32.780
And the numbers were set up to
give you a nice simple output.

00:36:32.780 --> 00:36:34.570
Okay?
 

00:36:34.570 --> 00:36:36.420
The numbers are cooked.
 

00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:39.050
So this one gets 50.
 

00:36:39.050 --> 00:36:46.016
Now, what happens if everybody
dies between the nineteenth and

00:36:46.016 --> 00:36:48.300
the twentieth day?
 

00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:51.170
That one gets 49.3.
 

00:36:51.170 --> 00:36:54.820
That's all the difference that
death at old age makes.

00:36:54.820 --> 00:36:57.480
And this is in a case where
there's no senescence.

00:36:57.480 --> 00:36:57.900
Right?
 

00:36:57.900 --> 00:37:02.280
This is kind of like light
bulbs failing or something like

00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:02.820
that.
 

00:37:02.820 --> 00:37:06.978
However, now let's throw in a
little life history tradeoff,

00:37:06.978 --> 00:37:09.130
and it's a really small one.
 

00:37:09.130 --> 00:37:13.574
This genotype here,
because it can lay eleven

00:37:13.574 --> 00:37:17.496
instead of ten eggs,
on the first day of life,

00:37:17.496 --> 00:37:20.880
dies, between the nineteenth
and the twentieth day,

00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:24.550
it leaves 50.3 progeny.
 

00:37:24.550 --> 00:37:30.599
It has a .6% fitness advantage.
 

00:37:30.599 --> 00:37:35.485
If we introduce this genotype
into the populations of the ones

00:37:35.485 --> 00:37:38.610
that live forever,
it will take over.

00:37:38.610 --> 00:37:41.599
There won't be any immortal
flies anymore.

00:37:41.599 --> 00:37:44.788
There will be flies that have
evolved a shorter lifespan

00:37:44.788 --> 00:37:48.324
because they had a reproductive
advantage early in life and it

00:37:48.324 --> 00:37:50.469
didn't take much of one to do
it.

00:37:55.018 --> 00:37:58.985
As you contemplate your own
mortality, I hope you realize

00:37:58.985 --> 00:38:02.739
that the Drosophila example in
fact is non-trivial;

00:38:02.739 --> 00:38:06.989
it's giving you an important
message.

00:38:06.989 --> 00:38:10.900
This is the strength of
selection on further survival in

00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:14.670
human males in the United States
in the year 1960,

00:38:14.670 --> 00:38:17.996
calculated from real
demographic data from the

00:38:17.996 --> 00:38:19.179
U.S. Census.
 

00:38:19.179 --> 00:38:24.780
This is the partial derivative
of fitness with respect to

00:38:24.780 --> 00:38:26.679
further survival.
 

00:38:26.679 --> 00:38:28.550
And it's a very interesting
picture.

00:38:28.550 --> 00:38:31.257
What it shows you is that as
soon as you become a teenager

00:38:31.257 --> 00:38:33.869
and you have some probability of
surviving in that human

00:38:33.869 --> 00:38:35.807
population,
your fitness starts to drop,

00:38:35.807 --> 00:38:37.449
because as soon as you've had a
baby,

00:38:37.449 --> 00:38:39.360
you have some probability of
grandchildren.

00:38:43.130 --> 00:38:47.654
And it shows you that after the
age of 46, evolution doesn't

00:38:47.654 --> 00:38:51.795
care if you're there anymore,
from the point of view of

00:38:51.795 --> 00:38:53.789
getting grandchildren.
 

00:38:56.889 --> 00:38:59.954
As someone who is out here,
I would like to congratulate

00:38:59.954 --> 00:39:00.679
all of you.
 

00:39:04.380 --> 00:39:06.119
There's a reason I look
different from you.

00:39:09.239 --> 00:39:12.396
Now this way of looking at
aging basically says that aging

00:39:12.396 --> 00:39:15.719
is a byproduct of selection for
reproductive performance,

00:39:15.719 --> 00:39:20.579
and the reason that it occurs
is that there's an accumulation

00:39:20.579 --> 00:39:23.688
of a lot of genes,
and they have positive or

00:39:23.688 --> 00:39:26.730
neutral effects on fitness
components early in life,

00:39:26.730 --> 00:39:30.010
and they have negative effects
on fitness components late in

00:39:30.010 --> 00:39:30.400
life.
 

00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:36.177
The positive effect is called
the antagonistic pleiotropy

00:39:36.177 --> 00:39:37.518
hypothesis.
 

00:39:37.518 --> 00:39:40.797
The idea is that the gene has
two effects: good early and bad

00:39:40.797 --> 00:39:41.179
late.
 

00:39:41.179 --> 00:39:43.378
It's like that one that gave
the fly one more baby,

00:39:43.378 --> 00:39:45.532
on the first day of life,
but killed it off at the

00:39:45.532 --> 00:39:46.719
nineteenth day of life.
 

00:39:46.719 --> 00:39:51.367
And neutral effects early and
negative effects late is called

00:39:51.367 --> 00:39:54.389
the mutation accumulation
hypothesis.

00:39:54.389 --> 00:39:58.536
And these two hypotheses formed
sort of the intellectual basis

00:39:58.536 --> 00:40:02.480
of research on the evolution of
aging for quite awhile,

00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:06.489
and they turn out to be not too
productive.

00:40:06.489 --> 00:40:09.409
It looks like--in fact,
most of the cases that have

00:40:09.409 --> 00:40:12.269
been well investigated,
suggest that it's positive

00:40:12.269 --> 00:40:14.840
effects early and negative
effects late;

00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:17.119
not neutral early and negative
late.

00:40:17.119 --> 00:40:18.369
Okay?
 

00:40:18.369 --> 00:40:20.590
But it's hard to distinguish
between these sometimes.

00:40:24.469 --> 00:40:27.760
A general take-home point is
this: that organisms age is

00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:31.291
actually the best evidence we
have that it's the replication

00:40:31.291 --> 00:40:34.001
of genes,
not the survival of organisms,

00:40:34.001 --> 00:40:36.059
that is the object of
evolution.

00:40:36.059 --> 00:40:40.014
So that gives you strong
empirical evidence that a

00:40:40.014 --> 00:40:45.260
gene-centered view of evolution
is in fact empirically correct.

00:40:50.139 --> 00:40:52.800
This is extremely discouraging
for the organisms that have

00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:55.369
consciousness and the ability to
analyze a situation.

00:40:55.369 --> 00:40:58.630
&gt;
 

00:40:58.630 --> 00:41:00.800
So, a bit of experimental
evidence.

00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:04.036
By the way, there have been
five or six experiments like

00:41:04.036 --> 00:41:04.449
this.
 

00:41:04.449 --> 00:41:06.449
I'm just showing you because
this is the one I did.

00:41:06.449 --> 00:41:08.989
We had two treatments.
 

00:41:08.989 --> 00:41:10.699
We had high and low adult
mortality.

00:41:10.699 --> 00:41:12.909
And if you followed the logic
so far,

00:41:12.909 --> 00:41:16.909
then you already know that if
you apply high adult mortality,

00:41:16.909 --> 00:41:19.230
then the organism should age
rapidly,

00:41:19.230 --> 00:41:21.070
and if you apply low adult
mortality,

00:41:21.070 --> 00:41:23.760
they should evolve to age more
slowly.

00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:27.170
So if you make the environment
risky, why try to invest in

00:41:27.170 --> 00:41:30.579
surviving, because somebody's
going to kill you anyway?

00:41:30.579 --> 00:41:32.996
And in this case it was a Swiss
laboratory technician that was

00:41:32.996 --> 00:41:35.085
doing the killing,
but one can imagine that it

00:41:35.085 --> 00:41:37.268
might have been a lion or
something like that.

00:41:37.268 --> 00:41:42.684
The result is that after five
years, which is about 70 to 110

00:41:42.684 --> 00:41:47.829
generations, in these flies,
aging evolved as expected.

00:41:47.829 --> 00:41:50.925
The higher extrinsic mortality
rates have produced shorter

00:41:50.925 --> 00:41:53.641
intrinsic life spans,
and the change was about five

00:41:53.641 --> 00:41:54.130
days.
 

00:41:57.949 --> 00:42:01.286
It's convenient that a day in
the life of a Drosophila is

00:42:01.286 --> 00:42:03.550
about a year in the life of a
human.

00:42:03.550 --> 00:42:06.438
So that gives you some feel,
some kind of intuitive feel for

00:42:06.438 --> 00:42:07.320
what this means.
 

00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:11.355
Basically what that means is
that if we had started applying

00:42:11.355 --> 00:42:15.460
this strength of selection at
the time of the Trojan War,

00:42:15.460 --> 00:42:18.878
we would have produced a
response in the human population

00:42:18.878 --> 00:42:20.650
of about five years by now.
 

00:42:20.650 --> 00:42:22.219
Okay?
 

00:42:22.219 --> 00:42:26.480
Just to put it back into the
human time scale.

00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:27.610
There's a paper here.
 

00:42:27.610 --> 00:42:29.268
You can go read about that if
you want.

00:42:29.268 --> 00:42:31.090
It gives you an entry into that
literature.

00:42:31.090 --> 00:42:35.795
To summarize today's lecture,
all the major life history

00:42:35.795 --> 00:42:38.789
traits--age and size at
maturity;

00:42:38.789 --> 00:42:41.690
number and size of offspring;
lifespan;

00:42:41.690 --> 00:42:44.815
reproductive investment--are
involved in tradeoffs,

00:42:44.815 --> 00:42:48.440
and that causes them to come to
evolutionary equilibrium at

00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:50.940
intermediate,
not at extreme values.

00:42:54.530 --> 00:42:57.869
They are all under stabilizing
selection caused by tradeoffs.

00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:05.313
Age and size at maturity,
number of offspring per birth

00:43:05.313 --> 00:43:07.902
and per lifetime,
and lifespan and aging have all

00:43:07.902 --> 00:43:08.550
evolved.
 

00:43:08.550 --> 00:43:11.588
I'll just riff on this for a
moment, to tell you how you've

00:43:11.588 --> 00:43:14.050
changed, compared to chimpanzees
and bonobos.

00:43:14.050 --> 00:43:20.269
Humans live a bit longer,
about oh twenty years longer.

00:43:23.679 --> 00:43:27.838
The unique human life history
traits that appear to have

00:43:27.838 --> 00:43:31.847
evolved since we shared
ancestors with chimpanzees and

00:43:31.847 --> 00:43:35.351
bonobos are menopause,
which does occur,

00:43:35.351 --> 00:43:39.414
but rarely, in zoo chimps,
and is almost never observed in

00:43:39.414 --> 00:43:39.949
the wild.
 

00:43:39.949 --> 00:43:44.253
The most striking thing though
is that we can have babies twice

00:43:44.253 --> 00:43:45.780
as fast as they can.
 

00:43:45.780 --> 00:43:51.291
The average time in a Neolithic
or hunter-gatherer society,

00:43:51.291 --> 00:43:56.708
between births is two years,
in humans, and in chimps it's

00:43:56.708 --> 00:43:58.230
five to six.
 

00:43:58.230 --> 00:44:02.697
That, despite the fact that
human babies are much more

00:44:02.697 --> 00:44:08.010
helpless and need a lot more
parental care when they're born.

00:44:08.010 --> 00:44:11.047
So, in fact,
humans have somehow managed to

00:44:11.047 --> 00:44:15.099
almost double the reproductive
output of chimpanzees,

00:44:15.099 --> 00:44:21.235
and it appears that they've
done it through social

00:44:21.235 --> 00:44:22.989
interaction.
 

00:44:22.989 --> 00:44:24.820
So family members help raise
the kids.

00:44:24.820 --> 00:44:28.409
Sometimes even partners help
raise the kids.

00:44:28.409 --> 00:44:30.030
Grandmothers help raise the
kids.

00:44:30.030 --> 00:44:31.760
But there's a lot of help.
 

00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:35.164
And so the reason that the
inter-birth interval in humans

00:44:35.164 --> 00:44:38.934
has been shortened dramatically
in the last five or six million

00:44:38.934 --> 00:44:43.010
years is because we have become
a much more highly integrated--

00:44:43.010 --> 00:44:48.860
we have a much better
integrated family life.

00:44:48.860 --> 00:44:51.730
The evolution of all of these
traits can be understood,

00:44:51.730 --> 00:44:54.949
in general, as an interaction
between extrinsic ecological

00:44:54.949 --> 00:44:58.010
conditions,
that determine mortality rates,

00:44:58.010 --> 00:45:01.820
and conditions inside organisms
to cause tradeoffs.

00:45:01.820 --> 00:45:04.090
So if you're looking for a
general explanatory structure,

00:45:04.090 --> 00:45:06.739
it is that the environment
poses problems,

00:45:06.739 --> 00:45:09.150
and when you answer that
problem with a solution,

00:45:09.150 --> 00:45:11.289
you are forced to make
compromises;

00:45:11.289 --> 00:45:15.159
and we know usually which kind
of compromises,

00:45:15.159 --> 00:45:18.983
and we are now in a position to
say if you're looking in the

00:45:18.983 --> 00:45:22.679
environment you should look for
these kinds of factors.

00:45:22.679 --> 00:45:25.663
Okay, next time we're going to
extend this framework into a

00:45:25.663 --> 00:45:29.110
particular part of life history
evolution called sex allocation,

00:45:29.110 --> 00:45:32.050
and how investment is divided
between male and female

00:45:32.050 --> 00:45:34.440
function,
and when it pays to switch sex

00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:37.349
and to be born as one sex and
turn into the other.

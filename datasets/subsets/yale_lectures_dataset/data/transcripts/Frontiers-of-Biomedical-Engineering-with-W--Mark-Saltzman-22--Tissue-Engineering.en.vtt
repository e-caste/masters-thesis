00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:16.641
Professor Mark Saltzman:
So, this week we're going

00:00:16.641 --> 00:00:19.470
to be talking about the subject
of tissue engineering.

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.592
It's covered directly in
Chapter 14 but not in a lot of

00:00:23.592 --> 00:00:27.193
detail.
I provided a couple of other

00:00:27.193 --> 00:00:31.772
readings which are listed here
on this slide,

00:00:31.772 --> 00:00:38.112
these are in the lecture notes.
If you go that folder there's

00:00:38.112 --> 00:00:42.460
two papers, one from 1993 and
one from 2002.

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.595
I would read them in that
order, read the one from 1993

00:00:45.595 --> 00:00:49.588
and then the one from 2002.
You'll see sort of how this

00:00:49.588 --> 00:00:53.008
field, which I'm going to
describe today,

00:00:53.008 --> 00:00:56.770
has evolved over the last 15
years or so.

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:00.214
Some of the challenges that
were talked about in this

00:01:00.214 --> 00:01:03.327
article from 1993,
you'll see, are still present

00:01:03.327 --> 00:01:05.630
today.
It's turned out to be more

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.225
difficult than biomedical
engineers thought to accomplish,

00:01:09.225 --> 00:01:12.228
some of these things.
Some of the things have gone

00:01:12.228 --> 00:01:15.364
faster, we've made more progress
than we thought we would in

00:01:15.364 --> 00:01:18.058
1993.
If you read those two papers,

00:01:18.058 --> 00:01:22.205
read the bit from Chapter 14
about tissue engineering,

00:01:22.205 --> 00:01:25.569
and then Chapter 16 I've also
given you.

00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:28.702
Chapter 16 is about
biomaterials and artificial

00:01:28.702 --> 00:01:32.993
organs, but there might be some
things in there which are useful

00:01:32.993 --> 00:01:36.330
to you in understanding this
subject as well.

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:42.280
Section will meet this Thursday
in the regular time and place.

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:52.269
What's the motivation for
tissue engineering?

00:01:52.269 --> 00:01:56.262
This slide has a lot of numbers
on it and the particular numbers

00:01:56.262 --> 00:02:00.331
are not important.
I've posted it in the notes for

00:02:00.331 --> 00:02:04.849
the course so you can look at it
at your leisure,

00:02:04.849 --> 00:02:10.012
but the main point here is that
there are many diseases that

00:02:10.012 --> 00:02:14.220
drugs cannot treat effectively.
They're diseases that are

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.650
prevalent, they don't occur in
small numbers.

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.063
That's why all the numbers are
here so you can see how many

00:02:21.063 --> 00:02:25.476
incidences there are of these
different--what is labeled on

00:02:25.476 --> 00:02:28.900
this slide organ and tissue
deficiencies.

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.748
For example,
you know that burns of the skin

00:02:31.748 --> 00:02:34.503
are quite common.
Some burns are not severe

00:02:34.503 --> 00:02:38.479
enough that they need any other
treatment other than maybe some

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:41.750
antibiotic lotion and a dressing
while it heals.

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.477
Some burns are so severe,
or so extensive,

00:02:45.477 --> 00:02:50.750
that they threaten the life of
the patient who has them.

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:56.300
If you lose enough of your
skin, you lose a lot of water

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:01.761
through that open area of skin.
You can become dehydrated to

00:03:01.761 --> 00:03:05.110
the point where you can die of
dehydration.

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.554
Your skin is an important
barrier for keeping water inside

00:03:09.554 --> 00:03:11.928
your body.
Of course, your skin is a

00:03:11.928 --> 00:03:14.747
barrier for keeping other things
outside the body,

00:03:14.747 --> 00:03:17.106
toxins, and in particular,
microorganisms,

00:03:17.106 --> 00:03:20.658
viruses, and bacteria.
So, your risk of infection is

00:03:20.658 --> 00:03:24.794
tremendous if you have large
burns over a significant part of

00:03:24.794 --> 00:03:28.139
your body.
There's no way to--that we

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:33.203
currently know to speed up the
healing of skin fast enough that

00:03:33.203 --> 00:03:38.430
patients that have severe skin
burns can survive that injury.

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.190
What's done is that you need
skin transplants;

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:46.041
you need preferably an
autograft of skin,

00:03:46.041 --> 00:03:50.034
taking skin from one place in
your body and putting it in

00:03:50.034 --> 00:03:53.125
another.
If you have severe burns over

00:03:53.125 --> 00:03:56.979
much of your body,
then there's no skin to graft.

00:03:56.979 --> 00:04:01.254
You might take an allograft,
an autograft is a graft from

00:04:01.254 --> 00:04:04.689
you, from the individual to the
individual,

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:07.500
taking some of your tissue and
moving them to another location;

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.591
that's 'auto', self graft.
Allograft is from a similar

00:04:11.591 --> 00:04:15.599
individual but not you,
somebody who might be matched

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:19.838
but not perfectly matched
immunologically to you and you

00:04:19.838 --> 00:04:22.926
get a graft from them.
When you get a blood

00:04:22.926 --> 00:04:25.746
transfusion from somebody that's
not you but there's some

00:04:25.746 --> 00:04:28.918
matching that's gone on to make
sure that you're not going to be

00:04:28.918 --> 00:04:32.310
incompatible with the blood,
that's an allograft.

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:39.152
Xenograft is a graft between
species, so that would be a

00:04:39.152 --> 00:04:43.879
graft from another species to
human,

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:45.934
for example,
or between species,

00:04:45.934 --> 00:04:48.188
so autograft,
allograft, xenograft,

00:04:48.188 --> 00:04:51.236
good words to know for our
discussion on tissue

00:04:51.236 --> 00:04:54.177
engineering.
You can imagine there's a

00:04:54.177 --> 00:04:57.671
limited number of allografts,
that is skin transplants that

00:04:57.671 --> 00:05:01.449
are available to treat burns.
So, not all the patients that

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:05.339
need them are able to get these
kinds of grafts and so life is

00:05:05.339 --> 00:05:09.506
threatened in that situation.
Not only burns but there are

00:05:09.506 --> 00:05:12.925
pressure sores,
what are commonly known as bed

00:05:12.925 --> 00:05:17.483
sores for patients that have to
spend significant time in bed

00:05:17.483 --> 00:05:21.219
because of an accident.
Let's say they've had a spinal

00:05:21.219 --> 00:05:24.332
cord injury and they have to
spend a lot of time recovering

00:05:24.332 --> 00:05:26.605
from that,
or they can't move anymore on

00:05:26.605 --> 00:05:29.812
their own and they'll develop
sores which are very difficult

00:05:29.812 --> 00:05:34.521
to heal.
Diabetics because they--because

00:05:34.521 --> 00:05:42.480
Diabetes can affect the sensory
nerves in your extremities,

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:46.160
often get sores in their
extremities, particularly in

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:50.110
their feet or lower leg,
which don't heal very well;

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:53.047
partly because they can't feel
them as well anymore,

00:05:53.047 --> 00:05:56.329
and so they become injured and
continue to get injured.

00:05:56.329 --> 00:06:01.102
Partly because the process of
Diabetes slows down healing in

00:06:01.102 --> 00:06:05.956
general, these--they get ulcers
or lesions on their skin that

00:06:05.956 --> 00:06:09.183
don't heal.
Just this top category alone

00:06:09.183 --> 00:06:11.989
lots of patients,
different indications,

00:06:11.989 --> 00:06:16.160
not enough tissue to treat
these tissue deficiencies of the

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.159
skin;
if you went down this list you

00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:23.232
would find many others as well.
Let me go down here,

00:06:23.232 --> 00:06:26.790
we're going to talk about in
some detail the liver.

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:30.831
When you get liver disease
that's severe enough,

00:06:30.831 --> 00:06:35.819
the only medical option right
now is a liver transplant.

00:06:35.819 --> 00:06:41.131
We'll talk about why that's the
only option available for liver

00:06:41.131 --> 00:06:44.129
disease that becomes very
severe,

00:06:44.129 --> 00:06:46.868
that could result from some
metabolic disorder,

00:06:46.868 --> 00:06:49.190
from cirrhosis,
or from liver cancer.

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:53.050
In that case,
a transplant is the only

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:56.127
option.
I'm sure you've all heard in

00:06:56.127 --> 00:06:59.562
the news about cases where there
is a patient,

00:06:59.562 --> 00:07:02.475
often a child,
who has some--a disease,

00:07:02.475 --> 00:07:05.975
waiting for a transplant and
calls will go out to the

00:07:05.975 --> 00:07:06.850
community.

00:07:10.259 --> 00:07:14.740
This is a familiar story in our
society.

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:18.466
The reason for that is because
there are a significant number

00:07:18.466 --> 00:07:20.949
of patients that are in this
category.

00:07:20.949 --> 00:07:25.689
Not as many as in the case of
skin, but a significant number.

00:07:25.689 --> 00:07:29.374
There is something like
tens of thousands of patients

00:07:29.374 --> 00:07:32.927
that are eligible for liver
transplants and waiting for

00:07:32.927 --> 00:07:35.089
them.
Why are they waiting?

00:07:35.089 --> 00:07:39.673
Because there's not enough
donor organs to satisfy the need

00:07:39.673 --> 00:07:49.750
of people that have transplants.
That's unlikely to change.

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:53.911
For a liver transplant donor to
become available,

00:07:53.911 --> 00:07:57.639
somebody has to die with a
healthy liver,

00:07:57.639 --> 00:08:01.963
they have to have consented to
have their organs used for

00:08:01.963 --> 00:08:05.205
another person,
and they have to be matched

00:08:05.205 --> 00:08:09.683
immunologically with the patient
who's going to receive the

00:08:09.683 --> 00:08:13.447
donor.
Somehow, those two things have

00:08:13.447 --> 00:08:17.731
to come together.
All of these things have to

00:08:17.731 --> 00:08:23.850
work right in order for a liver
donor and a recipient to match.

00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:26.772
They have to match not only
biologically,

00:08:26.772 --> 00:08:30.426
but it all has to match in
terms of timing as well,

00:08:30.426 --> 00:08:33.129
and that's a complicated
process.

00:08:33.129 --> 00:08:36.872
Today, if you go and look
on this website,

00:08:36.872 --> 00:08:39.950
we, 'we' meaning 'we as a
society',

00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:44.151
have set up organizations and
procedures to try to help with

00:08:44.151 --> 00:08:47.526
this matching process.
One of those is called The

00:08:47.526 --> 00:08:50.539
Organ Procurement and
Transplantation Network.

00:08:50.539 --> 00:08:54.105
They keep track of all of the
patients that are on lists

00:08:54.105 --> 00:08:57.554
waiting for organ donations,
they keep track of all the

00:08:57.554 --> 00:09:01.201
organs that are going to become
available and a matching process

00:09:01.201 --> 00:09:03.317
occurs,
and computers are involved,

00:09:03.317 --> 00:09:06.791
and all kinds of the resources
you would expect to be involved

00:09:06.791 --> 00:09:10.339
in this thing.
If you look for any particular

00:09:10.339 --> 00:09:14.122
kidney transplants,
there are currently as of

00:09:14.122 --> 00:09:17.820
yesterday 75,000 individuals in
the U.S.

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:23.200
waiting for donor kidneys;
in the liver there are 16,000.

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:27.791
These are patients that today
need an organ donation,

00:09:27.791 --> 00:09:33.177
their physicians have decided
that they're too sick to respond

00:09:33.177 --> 00:09:37.857
to any other treatment and
they're just waiting for an

00:09:37.857 --> 00:09:41.860
organ to appear.
I talked--in the very first

00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:45.514
lecture you might remember,
I showed you this picture to

00:09:45.514 --> 00:09:49.568
talk about--there's already very
high technology involved with

00:09:49.568 --> 00:09:53.547
this medical effort.
Part of the technology are

00:09:53.547 --> 00:09:57.470
things like this organ
procurement network.

00:09:57.470 --> 00:10:00.008
This is run electronically on
the internet,

00:10:00.008 --> 00:10:03.695
using all the high tech tools
of communication that we have in

00:10:03.695 --> 00:10:07.262
order to connect physicians who
are trying to treat patients

00:10:07.262 --> 00:10:11.009
with physicians who find that
there's a donor available,

00:10:11.009 --> 00:10:15.345
and by other high tech
industries like the airlines who

00:10:15.345 --> 00:10:19.519
can quickly move organs from one
place to another.

00:10:19.519 --> 00:10:25.924
If the donor of the organ died
in California and the recipient

00:10:25.924 --> 00:10:30.647
is here in New Haven,
then you've got to get the

00:10:30.647 --> 00:10:36.060
organ as quickly as possible
from California to Connecticut.

00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:42.443
That can be done now sometimes.
Another technology,

00:10:42.443 --> 00:10:46.440
which is embedded in this,
is that some hours have to pass

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:50.297
between when the organ is
harvested and the organ can be

00:10:50.297 --> 00:10:53.792
transplanted.
You need to be able to preserve

00:10:53.792 --> 00:10:57.610
organs for that period,
however long that period is.

00:10:57.610 --> 00:11:00.385
You'd like to be able to
preserve them for a long period

00:11:00.385 --> 00:11:02.549
of time.
What if we could preserve donor

00:11:02.549 --> 00:11:05.120
kidneys in the same way that we
preserve blood?

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:10.773
Blood--many of you have gone
when the Red Cross has come here

00:11:10.773 --> 00:11:15.197
looking for blood donations.
They take your blood,

00:11:15.197 --> 00:11:19.763
they store it in a special way
such that it can be used up to

00:11:19.763 --> 00:11:23.340
three weeks past the point when
you donated.

00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:27.850
That creates many opportunities
for your blood to be useful.

00:11:27.850 --> 00:11:30.481
In the same way,
if you donated organs and there

00:11:30.481 --> 00:11:33.896
were ways to preserve the organs
that would be--make them more

00:11:33.896 --> 00:11:36.459
useful as well.
There's a whole technology

00:11:36.459 --> 00:11:39.977
behind this that I wanted to at
least describe to you in words

00:11:39.977 --> 00:11:43.090
and you could think about.
Biomedical engineers are

00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:46.690
currently working around the
world on better ways to preserve

00:11:46.690 --> 00:11:49.090
organs, but it's a difficult
problem.

00:11:49.090 --> 00:11:52.128
It can be accomplished in blood
and certain kinds of blood

00:11:52.128 --> 00:11:54.953
cells, can be partially
accomplished with some tissues

00:11:54.953 --> 00:11:57.531
like skin,
cannot really be done with

00:11:57.531 --> 00:12:02.047
livers or kidneys.
Not yet, but there's a great

00:12:02.047 --> 00:12:05.612
need for that.
Why--I wanted to say a

00:12:05.612 --> 00:12:09.909
little bit more about why you
have to take this extraordinary

00:12:09.909 --> 00:12:14.350
measure of transplant to treat
diseases like liver failure.

00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:20.233
When a liver becomes so
diseased that it cannot recover

00:12:20.233 --> 00:12:25.789
its function on its own,
lots of things go wrong.

00:12:25.789 --> 00:12:30.947
This chart is a table of some
of the functions which are

00:12:30.947 --> 00:12:34.230
happening everyday in your
liver.

00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:37.171
The liver is an important
endocrine organ,

00:12:37.171 --> 00:12:39.970
we talked about the endocrine
system,

00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:44.920
it makes hormones like IGF1,
it activates Vitamin D which

00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:49.169
functions as a hormone,
is important for structure of

00:12:49.169 --> 00:12:53.177
your bones, it produces the
hormones that are used in your

00:12:53.177 --> 00:12:56.059
thyroid gland and many other
hormones.

00:12:56.059 --> 00:12:59.168
If your liver starts to die you
start to lose the ability to

00:12:59.168 --> 00:13:01.539
produce those hormones and you
can imagine,

00:13:01.539 --> 00:13:05.675
then, that lots of things in
your endocrine system start to

00:13:05.675 --> 00:13:08.355
go wrong.
The liver also produces many of

00:13:08.355 --> 00:13:11.426
the clotting factors;
these are proteins that are

00:13:11.426 --> 00:13:14.559
needed for clotting blood if you
have an injury.

00:13:14.559 --> 00:13:17.749
If the liver starts to die
you're not making as many of

00:13:17.749 --> 00:13:20.230
these, you can have a bleeding
disorder.

00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:23.843
It makes plasma proteins like
albumin, which have many

00:13:23.843 --> 00:13:26.897
functions in the body.
It makes bile acids,

00:13:26.897 --> 00:13:30.725
and bile acids are very
important as an excretory organ

00:13:30.725 --> 00:13:34.836
for getting rid of molecules
that the kidney is not able to

00:13:34.836 --> 00:13:38.070
eliminate into urine.
I could go on down the list.

00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:41.903
I put it here just to say that
when your kidney--when your

00:13:41.903 --> 00:13:45.399
liver fails thousands of things
start to go wrong.

00:13:45.399 --> 00:13:50.360
You could imagine treating any
one of these with drugs.

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:56.289
If the problem is activation of
Vitamin D you could take Vitamin

00:13:56.289 --> 00:14:00.429
D, you could take pre-activated
Vitamin D.

00:14:00.429 --> 00:14:03.830
If it was a thyroid hormone you
could take a thyroid hormone.

00:14:03.830 --> 00:14:08.050
If it was any one of these
things, there might be a medical

00:14:08.050 --> 00:14:11.643
solution for it.
But when it's this whole list

00:14:11.643 --> 00:14:15.265
of things, because your whole
organ is failing,

00:14:15.265 --> 00:14:19.360
you can't support that function
with drugs alone.

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:24.570
It's just too many things going
wrong at once.

00:14:24.570 --> 00:14:28.196
Drug therapies are usually
used for treating something

00:14:28.196 --> 00:14:31.695
where we understand what the
molecule is involved is and

00:14:31.695 --> 00:14:35.639
where there's only one or two
molecules that are involved.

00:14:35.639 --> 00:14:39.692
It's some metabolic disorder,
you're not making a particular

00:14:39.692 --> 00:14:43.384
molecule that you need.
So, you take it in the form of

00:14:43.384 --> 00:14:47.332
a pill, or you have an enzyme
that's not working properly and

00:14:47.332 --> 00:14:50.029
so you take injections of that
enzyme.

00:14:50.029 --> 00:14:54.061
In the case of cancer,
there's a single drug which can

00:14:54.061 --> 00:14:57.179
eliminate the unwanted cells in
cancer.

00:14:57.179 --> 00:15:00.590
These are areas where drug
therapy works.

00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:03.462
Gene therapy,
which we talked about a little

00:15:03.462 --> 00:15:06.029
bit, works in other kinds of
situations.

00:15:06.029 --> 00:15:12.029
Where you're missing an element
of a cellular process;

00:15:12.029 --> 00:15:16.389
like in cystic fibrosis for
example, your lungs and other

00:15:16.389 --> 00:15:20.826
tissues are missing a membrane
protein that's important in

00:15:20.826 --> 00:15:25.029
transport of chloride across
your lung epithelium.

00:15:25.029 --> 00:15:28.752
Now, you can't just take that
protein because it won't get

00:15:28.752 --> 00:15:31.559
inserted into the cells in the
right way.

00:15:31.559 --> 00:15:34.500
We talked about membranes and
how proteins are inserted in

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:36.866
membranes.
You can't just give the patient

00:15:36.866 --> 00:15:39.908
that membrane protein and have
it restored to the right

00:15:39.908 --> 00:15:43.087
location in the cell.
Because it's only one thing

00:15:43.087 --> 00:15:46.269
that's going wrong,
you can think about treating

00:15:46.269 --> 00:15:49.978
this with gene therapy,
by giving those cells that are

00:15:49.978 --> 00:15:53.744
missing the protein a gene that
allows them to produce that

00:15:53.744 --> 00:15:57.120
protein on their own and to
correctly insert into the

00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:59.775
membrane.
Gene therapy is possible to

00:15:59.775 --> 00:16:03.137
think about in diseases like
cystic fibrosis and some

00:16:03.137 --> 00:16:06.370
diseases of the liver and other
organs as well.

00:16:06.370 --> 00:16:09.961
In general, they're diseases
that are caused by a single gene

00:16:09.961 --> 00:16:12.629
defect.
When we're thinking about

00:16:12.629 --> 00:16:16.668
liver failing lots of things are
going wrong, many genes

00:16:16.668 --> 00:16:19.424
involved.
Gene therapy isn't really

00:16:19.424 --> 00:16:23.250
thinkable in that situation
where the whole organ is

00:16:23.250 --> 00:16:27.714
starting to fail.
Whole organ transplantation is

00:16:27.714 --> 00:16:32.556
the only current solution,
a surgical solution for

00:16:32.556 --> 00:16:37.126
problems like heart failure,
kidney failure,

00:16:37.126 --> 00:16:40.941
liver failure,
where the whole organ is

00:16:40.941 --> 00:16:44.316
starting to fail.
The motivation,

00:16:44.316 --> 00:16:49.780
then, for tissue engineering is
to try to think about another

00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:54.335
way to treat these diseases
where you would somehow

00:16:54.335 --> 00:16:59.617
manufacture or create a tissue
in the laboratory that could

00:16:59.617 --> 00:17:05.720
substitute for the transplanted
tissue from another patient.

00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:10.266
The idea is to try to make
synthetic or semi-synthetic

00:17:10.266 --> 00:17:15.670
tissues that could take over the
function of a failing liver,

00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:18.883
a failing kidney,
a failing blood vessel,

00:17:18.883 --> 00:17:22.665
a failing heart.
It is intended to treat these

00:17:22.665 --> 00:17:27.337
diseases that are too complex to
think about complex in the

00:17:27.337 --> 00:17:30.640
number of things that are going
wrong;

00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:34.226
too complex to treat with any
of the other therapies we've

00:17:34.226 --> 00:17:37.750
talked about over the course of
the--of our time here.

00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:42.206
This is a field that was
really--has ancient roots,

00:17:42.206 --> 00:17:46.579
and those ancient roots are
discussed in your book.

00:17:46.579 --> 00:17:51.224
The idea of engineering tissues
was really only developed

00:17:51.224 --> 00:17:54.376
relatively recently,
and first defined,

00:17:54.376 --> 00:17:58.332
really, in the 1980s.
That first paper I gave you to

00:17:58.332 --> 00:18:02.555
read by Langer &amp;
Vacanti is really considered

00:18:02.555 --> 00:18:07.119
one of the first,
most influential scientific

00:18:07.119 --> 00:18:12.023
papers in this growing field.
Here's one definition of what

00:18:12.023 --> 00:18:15.083
tissue engineering is.
I told you what the goals of it

00:18:15.083 --> 00:18:18.283
are kind of in broad terms,
but it's the 'application of

00:18:18.283 --> 00:18:21.424
principles and methods of
engineering and life sciences

00:18:21.424 --> 00:18:24.508
toward fundamental understanding
of structure function

00:18:24.508 --> 00:18:28.289
relationships in normal and
pathologic mammalian tissues'.

00:18:28.289 --> 00:18:31.376
That's not the more interesting
part to me, the more interesting

00:18:31.376 --> 00:18:33.649
part to me is,
'and the development of

00:18:33.649 --> 00:18:36.432
biological substitutes to
restore, maintain,

00:18:36.432 --> 00:18:40.424
or improve tissue function.'
Why is it only in the 1980s

00:18:40.424 --> 00:18:43.049
that people started thinking
about this?

00:18:43.049 --> 00:18:46.466
There's really two reasons and
one is an engineering reason,

00:18:46.466 --> 00:18:49.014
a broad reason,
and the other is sort of life

00:18:49.014 --> 00:18:53.048
science and biology reason.
We had come to the point in the

00:18:53.048 --> 00:18:57.454
1980s where a lot of the biology
that we have talked about now

00:18:57.454 --> 00:19:00.419
was fairly well known.
In particular,

00:19:00.419 --> 00:19:05.387
the biology of cells in culture
of taking cells out of organs

00:19:05.387 --> 00:19:08.319
and tissues,
maintaining them in culture,

00:19:08.319 --> 00:19:11.878
getting them to do the things
we wanted to do in culture was

00:19:11.878 --> 00:19:15.559
fairly well known by the 1980s,
it's a fairly mature technology.

00:19:15.559 --> 00:19:20.214
One could think about using
cell culture techniques to

00:19:20.214 --> 00:19:25.960
produce complicated structures.
The other is an engineering

00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:32.400
advance and that is that we had
developed, by the 1980s,

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:36.306
enough understanding of
artificial biomaterials that we

00:19:36.306 --> 00:19:40.864
could start to create materials
that had unique properties which

00:19:40.864 --> 00:19:45.278
made them good candidates for
use in the kinds of applications

00:19:45.278 --> 00:19:48.001
I'll talk about.
The innovations,

00:19:48.001 --> 00:19:51.394
or the kind of foundations of
tissue engineering,

00:19:51.394 --> 00:19:53.940
are our ability to culture
cells,

00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:55.719
to do that reliably,
reproducibly,

00:19:55.719 --> 00:19:58.738
to understand what cells are
going to do when we maintain

00:19:58.738 --> 00:20:02.217
them outside the body,
and our ability to build

00:20:02.217 --> 00:20:07.236
materials that are biocompatible
that can be implanted into

00:20:07.236 --> 00:20:12.170
people and that can serve as
scaffolds for new tissue.

00:20:12.170 --> 00:20:15.880
I'll say more about what that
means.

00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:18.813
Just to try to put this in
more concrete terms,

00:20:18.813 --> 00:20:22.274
here's two examples of how you
might artificially engineer a

00:20:22.274 --> 00:20:24.751
tissue,
or two kinds of applications

00:20:24.751 --> 00:20:28.480
that people might think about in
a heart that's failing.

00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:31.565
I use this as an example
because we know a lot about the

00:20:31.565 --> 00:20:35.100
cardiovascular system now and so
you'll understand both of these

00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:37.657
examples.
We talked about the important

00:20:37.657 --> 00:20:41.123
function of the blood vessels of
the heart, the coronary

00:20:41.123 --> 00:20:44.272
arteries.
We also talked a little bit

00:20:44.272 --> 00:20:48.970
about how these vessels can
become diseased in life,

00:20:48.970 --> 00:20:54.377
particularly for patients in
the 6^(th) or 7^(th) decade of

00:20:54.377 --> 00:20:57.138
their life.
This vessel might become

00:20:57.138 --> 00:21:00.170
diseased through a process of
arthrosclerosis;

00:21:00.170 --> 00:21:04.539
the lumen becomes narrowed such
that blood no longer flows.

00:21:04.539 --> 00:21:08.070
The resistance gets too high
for blood to flow well,

00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:10.769
so you'd like to replace this
artery.

00:21:10.769 --> 00:21:14.297
The only thing that the
artery has to do is carry blood

00:21:14.297 --> 00:21:17.642
from one place to the other,
so really all you need is a

00:21:17.642 --> 00:21:19.825
tube.
People have tried for years to

00:21:19.825 --> 00:21:22.769
use different kinds of tubes to
replace this section;

00:21:22.769 --> 00:21:25.920
the operation is called a
cardiac-bypass.

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:29.629
A surgeon will go in,
he will remove this diseased

00:21:29.629 --> 00:21:32.960
section of tissue,
or he'll just put a bypass

00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:35.640
around it,
that is, a tube that goes from

00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:38.069
this location and connects to
this location.

00:21:38.069 --> 00:21:42.487
Like a bypass on the highway
it's a clear route that allows

00:21:42.487 --> 00:21:46.599
you to get around a route that's
no longer passable.

00:21:46.599 --> 00:21:50.200
Well, these vessels carry a
lot of blood.

00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:52.867
They have to be very reliable
vessels because they need to

00:21:52.867 --> 00:21:55.488
carry blood all the time because
your heart is constantly

00:21:55.488 --> 00:21:58.470
working,
it needs a constant reliable

00:21:58.470 --> 00:22:01.981
source of blood.
The best substitute for this is

00:22:01.981 --> 00:22:04.902
a natural one.
So, one of the most successful

00:22:04.902 --> 00:22:08.767
operations here is to take a
blood vessel from somewhere else

00:22:08.767 --> 00:22:12.310
in the patient's body and use it
to create a bypass.

00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:17.515
You'd like it to be an artery.
Bypasses can be made,

00:22:17.515 --> 00:22:21.300
there's another artery that's
nearby called the internal

00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:24.259
mammary artery that surgeons
could take.

00:22:24.259 --> 00:22:27.087
You can take it from the tissue
sort of near the heart,

00:22:27.087 --> 00:22:29.549
it doesn't really serve as
important a function,

00:22:29.549 --> 00:22:33.753
and you can bypass it in here.
Now you have a new artery in

00:22:33.753 --> 00:22:37.353
place to continue to flow blood.
That works,

00:22:37.353 --> 00:22:39.980
but what if you have more than
one site of blockage?

00:22:39.980 --> 00:22:42.844
What if you have a blockage
here, and a blockage here,

00:22:42.844 --> 00:22:45.870
and a blockage over here,
and a blockage over here so you

00:22:45.870 --> 00:22:48.865
need multiple bypasses?
You don't have enough arteries

00:22:48.865 --> 00:22:51.590
in order to do that.
Then, the surgeon will go and

00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:53.809
take the saphenous vein from
your leg.

00:22:53.809 --> 00:22:57.847
It's a large vein in your leg
that returns blood that's flowed

00:22:57.847 --> 00:23:00.759
down to your leg back up to the
vena cava.

00:23:00.759 --> 00:23:03.843
There are enough other veins in
your leg that you can lose that

00:23:03.843 --> 00:23:06.230
vein without any loss of
function in your leg.

00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:10.260
They can now take the vein and
cut it up into segments,

00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:14.365
and use that to bypass all
these segments of artery that

00:23:14.365 --> 00:23:16.786
are clogged.
That works as well,

00:23:16.786 --> 00:23:20.529
but veins aren't the same as
arteries, you remember that.

00:23:20.529 --> 00:23:23.795
If you take a vein which has a
different anatomical structure

00:23:23.795 --> 00:23:27.115
and put it in the position of an
artery that is exposed to the

00:23:27.115 --> 00:23:30.000
high pressures that you know
already occur there,

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:33.718
sometimes that works.
Sometimes the vessel changes

00:23:33.718 --> 00:23:36.731
and remodels and adapts so that
it functions,

00:23:36.731 --> 00:23:41.024
and sometimes it doesn't.
Sometimes those veins also

00:23:41.024 --> 00:23:46.046
become diseased and they no
longer serve as an effective

00:23:46.046 --> 00:23:49.259
bypass.
Then, what do you do?

00:23:49.259 --> 00:23:52.861
If both of those options fail
you can try to use synthetic

00:23:52.861 --> 00:23:55.503
materials.
Synthetic materials are used to

00:23:55.503 --> 00:23:58.480
replace blood vessels in many
parts of the body.

00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:03.785
If you have an aorta that has
an aneurism, a surgeon can put a

00:24:03.785 --> 00:24:06.915
synthetic piece of,
basically Dacron,

00:24:06.915 --> 00:24:11.557
a synthetic material.
It will serve as a functional

00:24:11.557 --> 00:24:16.114
aorta and do a very nice job.
It turns out that we know from

00:24:16.114 --> 00:24:18.986
experience, now,
that that only works if the

00:24:18.986 --> 00:24:22.276
vessel is big enough,
because for big vessels all of

00:24:22.276 --> 00:24:25.029
these kinds of synthetic
materials that we make.

00:24:25.029 --> 00:24:28.529
While they might have the right
mechanical properties to serve

00:24:28.529 --> 00:24:30.710
as an aorta, they're not
biological.

00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:36.539
So, blood will clot when it
hits that unnatural surface.

00:24:36.539 --> 00:24:40.983
It's okay if blood clots on
the surface of a big artery

00:24:40.983 --> 00:24:45.657
because it's big enough that you
could have a lining of a clot

00:24:45.657 --> 00:24:49.920
here along the inside,
and it would still be enough

00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:53.492
diameter to flow.
If it's a small artery and it

00:24:53.492 --> 00:24:56.769
clots blood doesn't pass through
any longer.

00:24:56.769 --> 00:25:00.185
We know now that the limit of
what one can do with synthetic

00:25:00.185 --> 00:25:03.369
materials is about half a
millimeter to a millimeter,

00:25:03.369 --> 00:25:05.819
and that's the size of these
coronary arteries.

00:25:05.819 --> 00:25:08.099
You can't use synthetic
materials there.

00:25:08.099 --> 00:25:13.559
What we'd like to do is grow an
artery outside the body.

00:25:13.559 --> 00:25:19.415
What if we could that by taking
the synthetic material and

00:25:19.415 --> 00:25:23.730
growing on it a lining of
natural cells?

00:25:23.730 --> 00:25:27.053
The synthetic material would
provide the mechanical

00:25:27.053 --> 00:25:30.509
properties needed for it to
function as an artery.

00:25:30.509 --> 00:25:34.121
If we could grow natural
arterial and endothelial cells

00:25:34.121 --> 00:25:37.933
all over the surface of this,
the blood wouldn't know that

00:25:37.933 --> 00:25:42.107
it's a synthetic material.
It would only see the cells

00:25:42.107 --> 00:25:46.845
which are forming the natural
barrier, the natural wall of a

00:25:46.845 --> 00:25:49.092
blood vessel,
so that's tissue

00:25:49.092 --> 00:25:52.523
engineering--an example of
tissue engineering to create an

00:25:52.523 --> 00:25:54.809
artificial artery to use in
bypass.

00:25:54.809 --> 00:25:58.919
I'm going to talk more about
the details of where we are in

00:25:58.919 --> 00:26:03.170
that process and what the
obstacles are next--on Thursday.

00:26:03.170 --> 00:26:06.133
Let's say you didn't get
there in time and a particular

00:26:06.133 --> 00:26:08.995
patient--they didn't have a
bypass in time so they have a

00:26:08.995 --> 00:26:11.239
blockage.
They have a mild cardial

00:26:11.239 --> 00:26:14.728
infarction or a heart attack
because the blood becomes

00:26:14.728 --> 00:26:18.879
comprised to some area.
This area of the heart doesn't

00:26:18.879 --> 00:26:23.676
get blood for some period of
time, and so this tissue in the

00:26:23.676 --> 00:26:28.181
wall of the heart dies.
Now, in general if that happens

00:26:28.181 --> 00:26:32.654
there's only a limited ability
of your heart tissue to heal

00:26:32.654 --> 00:26:36.818
after you have a heart attack.
A scar is formed here and this

00:26:36.818 --> 00:26:39.894
part of the heart doesn't
function in the same way that it

00:26:39.894 --> 00:26:42.650
did before.
Remember how it functions,

00:26:42.650 --> 00:26:46.183
is it has to transmit
electrical signals and it has to

00:26:46.183 --> 00:26:49.650
contract in response to those
electrical signals.

00:26:49.650 --> 00:26:52.210
It has to do that with a
regular frequency,

00:26:52.210 --> 00:26:56.049
so it has to both conduct the
electrical signal and contract.

00:26:56.049 --> 00:27:00.660
This damaged cardiac muscle
doesn't do that anymore.

00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:03.721
Well, sometimes that's okay.
You might not need all of your

00:27:03.721 --> 00:27:06.712
cardiac muscle to be functioning
in order to have a reasonable

00:27:06.712 --> 00:27:10.036
efficient heartbeat,
but sometime the area of this

00:27:10.036 --> 00:27:14.505
is so large that it compromises
the ability of your heart to

00:27:14.505 --> 00:27:18.519
deliver the cardiac output you
need to stay alive.

00:27:18.519 --> 00:27:23.410
What if you could make an
artificial cardiac muscle?

00:27:23.410 --> 00:27:28.159
What if you could take some
kind of a material and grow

00:27:28.159 --> 00:27:33.407
cardiac muscle cells on it?
Grow them in such a way that

00:27:33.407 --> 00:27:39.283
they filled up this material and
they started to function like

00:27:39.283 --> 00:27:41.795
heart,
that is, they functioned in the

00:27:41.795 --> 00:27:44.554
right electrical way and they
functioned in the right

00:27:44.554 --> 00:27:47.797
mechanical way.
Then, maybe a physician could

00:27:47.797 --> 00:27:52.687
come in and just sew this patch
that you've created outside the

00:27:52.687 --> 00:27:58.438
body into place on the tissue.
Maybe that patch would start to

00:27:58.438 --> 00:28:04.940
function like that part of the
heart wall that didn't function.

00:28:04.940 --> 00:28:08.749
Now, where would the cells come
from that you did that with if

00:28:08.749 --> 00:28:11.559
we think about this particular
application,

00:28:11.559 --> 00:28:16.515
we're going to create a patch
for repairing myocardial

00:28:16.515 --> 00:28:19.660
defects.
Where would the cells come from?

00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:25.760
What would be your first choice
of cells that you use for this?

00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:31.386
Justin?Student: From
the heart.Professor Mark

00:28:31.386 --> 00:28:33.539
Saltzman: From the heart.
From what heart?

00:28:33.539 --> 00:28:35.389
Student: From the
patient's heart.Professor

00:28:35.389 --> 00:28:36.930
Mark Saltzman: From the
patient's own heart.

00:28:36.930 --> 00:28:40.793
What if you could take a small
biopsy of tissue from somewhere

00:28:40.793 --> 00:28:43.952
else in the heart?
You could take a small sample

00:28:43.952 --> 00:28:46.955
of those cells,
and you could take them outside

00:28:46.955 --> 00:28:49.369
the body and grow them in
culture.

00:28:49.369 --> 00:28:52.638
Well, this is where our ability
to culture cells comes in very

00:28:52.638 --> 00:28:55.049
handy because we could take a
small sample,

00:28:55.049 --> 00:28:58.115
isolate the cells we want,
propagate them in culture until

00:28:58.115 --> 00:29:01.274
we had millions of those cells,
put them into the patch,

00:29:01.274 --> 00:29:03.410
put the patch back into the
patient.

00:29:03.410 --> 00:29:07.110
Now, the patient has an
autograft of cells,

00:29:07.110 --> 00:29:11.427
but placed in the right
configuration so that they

00:29:11.427 --> 00:29:16.130
function as a tissue.
What are the problems with that?

00:29:16.130 --> 00:29:16.970
What's the problem with that?

00:29:20.299 --> 00:29:21.822
Student: The entire
organ is

00:29:21.822 --> 00:29:24.307
diseased.Professor Mark
Saltzman: If the disease was

00:29:24.307 --> 00:29:26.440
too big you couldn't do that.
Why couldn't you do that?

00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:28.483
Because you couldn't grow
enough cells,

00:29:28.483 --> 00:29:30.688
you think,
or--Student: Because

00:29:30.688 --> 00:29:32.247
[inaudible]
doesn't use tissue

00:29:32.247 --> 00:29:35.420
[inaudible].Professor
Mark Saltzman: Yeah.

00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:38.361
You might--there might be some
practical limits to it but

00:29:38.361 --> 00:29:41.880
you're getting close to what the
real problem with that would be.

00:29:46.470 --> 00:29:50.566
Think about the timing of it.
How long would it take you to

00:29:50.566 --> 00:29:54.008
take this biopsy and grow the
cells and make a new

00:29:54.008 --> 00:29:57.309
artificial--probably would take
weeks to do.

00:29:57.309 --> 00:30:03.256
Could the patient survive those
weeks while you're making the

00:30:03.256 --> 00:30:07.966
tissue engineered solution?
Maybe, maybe not,

00:30:07.966 --> 00:30:13.367
it would depend on how
extensive the failure of the

00:30:13.367 --> 00:30:18.534
heart was, as Justin described.
What would be another

00:30:18.534 --> 00:30:21.910
solution to that?
Well, let's not take cells from

00:30:21.910 --> 00:30:25.769
the patient but let's create a
bank of heart cells.

00:30:25.769 --> 00:30:28.260
That might be possible,
but you have to be able to

00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:31.062
preserve heart cells.
You have to have a bank of

00:30:31.062 --> 00:30:34.579
cells with all the right
immunological markers labeled,

00:30:34.579 --> 00:30:37.071
you have to have them in enough
quantity that they would be

00:30:37.071 --> 00:30:40.146
available rapidly.
There's problems with that but

00:30:40.146 --> 00:30:47.430
maybe you could do it that way.
Maybe you could use stem cells.

00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:50.639
We talked about stem cells
before and some of their

00:30:50.639 --> 00:30:53.399
capabilities,
but one of the real advantages

00:30:53.399 --> 00:30:57.443
of what people think of as using
stem cells to treat diseases in

00:30:57.443 --> 00:31:01.230
adults is just exactly what
we're talking about here.

00:31:01.230 --> 00:31:05.460
Being able to create an
environment or an engineering

00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:09.610
solution in which stem cells
could be used to create

00:31:09.610 --> 00:31:13.058
functional tissue.
In this case you'd want stem

00:31:13.058 --> 00:31:16.672
cells that could very quickly
become cardiac muscle cells that

00:31:16.672 --> 00:31:19.930
could be differentiated in the
cardiac muscle cells.

00:31:19.930 --> 00:31:23.824
Ideally, you'd want stem cells
from the same person,

00:31:23.824 --> 00:31:28.024
you'd like to isolate them from
the same person somehow,

00:31:28.024 --> 00:31:30.849
or from a donor that was
matched.

00:31:30.849 --> 00:31:34.705
You're starting to see both the
opportunity, I hope,

00:31:34.705 --> 00:31:39.241
and the problems that have to
be solved in creating these new

00:31:39.241 --> 00:31:41.743
solutions.
I list on this slide a few

00:31:41.743 --> 00:31:44.776
of the characteristics of tissue
engineering that we're going to

00:31:44.776 --> 00:31:46.911
talk about,
not in quite this organized a

00:31:46.911 --> 00:31:49.936
way, but I hope that by the end
of the week you'll be able to

00:31:49.936 --> 00:31:53.130
look back at this list and say,
'Oh, I understand what that

00:31:53.130 --> 00:31:56.584
characteristic means in terms of
what we're trying to accomplish

00:31:56.584 --> 00:31:59.689
in tissue engineering.'
The first is what I've been

00:31:59.689 --> 00:32:03.659
talking about up to this point.
The tissue engineering really

00:32:03.659 --> 00:32:07.756
represents kind of a modern or
contemporary logical extension

00:32:07.756 --> 00:32:11.170
of conventional medical and
surgical practices.

00:32:11.170 --> 00:32:13.045
If we're going to make an
engineered tissue,

00:32:13.045 --> 00:32:14.920
in many cases,
we're going to give them to a

00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:17.579
surgeon and they're going to do
what they know how to do,

00:32:17.579 --> 00:32:20.119
which is replace an organ or a
tissue.

00:32:20.119 --> 00:32:24.155
You're just giving another
resource to surgeons to do what

00:32:24.155 --> 00:32:27.880
they know how to do already.
We're using it to extend

00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:31.813
medical practices to diseases
that can't be treated by drugs

00:32:31.813 --> 00:32:34.880
or gene therapy or other kinds
of medicine.

00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:37.675
What I want to talk about
for most of the rest of the time

00:32:37.675 --> 00:32:39.279
today is this second bullet
here,

00:32:39.279 --> 00:32:41.783
that tissue engineering
involves control or regulation

00:32:41.783 --> 00:32:45.179
of normal healing processes.
That if we want to understand

00:32:45.179 --> 00:32:49.344
and use tissue engineering we
need to know something about how

00:32:49.344 --> 00:32:53.167
the body heals itself and take
advantage of those natural

00:32:53.167 --> 00:32:55.829
mechanisms of tissue
regeneration.

00:32:55.829 --> 00:32:59.220
We'll talk over the course of
the next two lectures about

00:32:59.220 --> 00:33:02.551
tissue engineering as an attempt
to replace the cellular

00:33:02.551 --> 00:33:06.398
component of diseased tissues.
Whereas in drug therapy we're

00:33:06.398 --> 00:33:09.974
thinking about the molecular
component, now we're replacing

00:33:09.974 --> 00:33:12.889
cells,
that it uses cellular processes

00:33:12.889 --> 00:33:15.630
sometimes to control drug
delivery.

00:33:15.630 --> 00:33:19.458
We'll talk about how you could
use tissue engineering as a drug

00:33:19.458 --> 00:33:21.966
delivery system,
and that tissue engineering

00:33:21.966 --> 00:33:24.809
produces new models for the
study of human physiology.

00:33:24.809 --> 00:33:26.859
I won't say anything more
about that this week,

00:33:26.859 --> 00:33:30.141
so let me just say that now,
that what if you could produce

00:33:30.141 --> 00:33:33.150
heart tissue like this for
transplantation?

00:33:33.150 --> 00:33:36.869
Another use for it would be if
I can make this tissue outside

00:33:36.869 --> 00:33:39.660
the body that behaves like the
human heart,

00:33:39.660 --> 00:33:43.794
I can use it to study how the
human heart works outside the

00:33:43.794 --> 00:33:46.289
body in a much more reliable
way,

00:33:46.289 --> 00:33:49.903
or a much more sophisticated
way than I could with ordinary

00:33:49.903 --> 00:33:52.367
cell cultures.
Because now you not only have

00:33:52.367 --> 00:33:55.251
the cells of the heart but you
have the cells of the heart

00:33:55.251 --> 00:33:57.630
arranged in the right kind of
configuration,

00:33:57.630 --> 00:34:00.908
so I could understand--I could
use it to understand how the

00:34:00.908 --> 00:34:03.524
heart develops.
I could expose it to different

00:34:03.524 --> 00:34:05.784
drugs and ask,
'What are the toxicities of

00:34:05.784 --> 00:34:07.769
these drugs to the normal
heart?'

00:34:07.769 --> 00:34:12.375
without doing it in patients,
and with doing it in a system

00:34:12.375 --> 00:34:16.901
where I have a lot of control
and a lot of ability to look

00:34:16.901 --> 00:34:21.225
inside and see what's happening.
Let me go back to this

00:34:21.225 --> 00:34:24.550
point now, tissue engineering
involves control or regulation

00:34:24.550 --> 00:34:28.106
of the normal healing process.
We're all familiar with at

00:34:28.106 --> 00:34:32.022
least some aspects of healing
because you've all had a cut in

00:34:32.022 --> 00:34:35.937
the skin that has maybe caused
you some distress in the short

00:34:35.937 --> 00:34:37.870
term.
Maybe it was a cut that was

00:34:37.870 --> 00:34:40.670
deep enough, and this shows you
the structure of the skin.

00:34:40.670 --> 00:34:44.962
Here's the outer layer of the
skin here that forms this sort

00:34:44.962 --> 00:34:48.891
of thick barrier layer,
the epidermis that things can't

00:34:48.891 --> 00:34:51.829
penetrate;
water can't penetrate easily.

00:34:51.829 --> 00:34:55.343
You put water on top of your
skin, it beads up there,

00:34:55.343 --> 00:34:58.614
it doesn't get absorbed.
Likewise, water inside doesn't

00:34:58.614 --> 00:35:01.139
come out and that's why you
don't get dehydrated.

00:35:01.139 --> 00:35:04.829
Microorganisms can't go through
because of this barrier.

00:35:04.829 --> 00:35:08.216
Underneath is a more
connective tissue layer called

00:35:08.216 --> 00:35:11.664
the dermis and inside this
dermis there's cells that are

00:35:11.664 --> 00:35:14.800
producing an extracellular
matrix of collagen,

00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:18.096
largely.
We talked about extracellular

00:35:18.096 --> 00:35:22.819
matrixes several weeks ago.
Within that collagenous matrix

00:35:22.819 --> 00:35:26.584
there are blood vessels,
arteries red here,

00:35:26.584 --> 00:35:30.783
veins blue.
Those blood vessels bring blood

00:35:30.783 --> 00:35:35.911
to the skin to provide oxygen,
and to get rid of carbon

00:35:35.911 --> 00:35:40.280
dioxide in these cells in your
living skin.

00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:44.194
You get a cut in this tissue
and what happens if it's a deep

00:35:44.194 --> 00:35:48.592
enough cut you bleed.
You got to do something to stop

00:35:48.592 --> 00:35:52.441
the bleeding.
You've had this and so you put

00:35:52.441 --> 00:35:56.778
some pressure on and you wait
for clotting to occur,

00:35:56.778 --> 00:36:00.010
but you've disrupted these
vessels.

00:36:00.010 --> 00:36:03.363
They have clotted so that a
clot has formed inside these

00:36:03.363 --> 00:36:05.619
vessels so that the bleeding
stops.

00:36:05.619 --> 00:36:08.159
Usually a clot forms at the
surface.

00:36:08.159 --> 00:36:12.653
If you look at this after
you've got the bleeding stopped

00:36:12.653 --> 00:36:16.513
you have a red looking area.
It looks different from your

00:36:16.513 --> 00:36:19.159
skin, that's the beginning of
the healing process,

00:36:19.159 --> 00:36:24.489
is that your body has
coagulated blood at that site to

00:36:24.489 --> 00:36:28.309
replace the tissue that's been
lost.

00:36:28.309 --> 00:36:33.399
You'll have a red spot there
that turns into a reddish

00:36:33.399 --> 00:36:36.864
looking scab.
That's your body responding to

00:36:36.864 --> 00:36:39.497
stop the immediate insult,
the bleeding,

00:36:39.497 --> 00:36:43.750
and to fill up the space of
this tissue that's been damaged.

00:36:43.750 --> 00:36:45.701
Cut's too big,
this can't happen,

00:36:45.701 --> 00:36:48.444
you can't just put pressure on
it and stop it,

00:36:48.444 --> 00:36:51.563
and so what do you do?
You go to the emergency room,

00:36:51.563 --> 00:36:54.323
you get some stitches.
They bring the sides of that

00:36:54.323 --> 00:36:57.409
wound back together with
stitches, they hold it closed.

00:36:57.409 --> 00:37:01.238
The same thing happens but in
the smaller space now,

00:37:01.238 --> 00:37:05.742
because they've just brought
the tissue together so that your

00:37:05.742 --> 00:37:09.269
body could produce this
provisional tissue.

00:37:09.269 --> 00:37:13.630
The provisional tissue at the
beginning is just a blood clot.

00:37:13.630 --> 00:37:17.483
After that point many
things start happening within

00:37:17.483 --> 00:37:21.979
the skin, and a complex process
of cells sending out signals and

00:37:21.979 --> 00:37:26.332
cells responding to signals in a
coordinated and regulated way

00:37:26.332 --> 00:37:29.602
occurs.
What this diagram shows is some

00:37:29.602 --> 00:37:33.608
little fingers of tissue
entering into this coagulated

00:37:33.608 --> 00:37:37.840
provisional matrix that was
formed by the blood clot.

00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:42.643
These cells are initially cells
that are called fibroblasts

00:37:42.643 --> 00:37:46.595
which live in the dermis.
Normally, they're just sitting

00:37:46.595 --> 00:37:49.740
there sort of in a quiescent
state, not reproducing very

00:37:49.740 --> 00:37:51.410
rapidly,
making collagen,

00:37:51.410 --> 00:37:55.184
providing matrix to keep up
sort of the normal structure of

00:37:55.184 --> 00:37:57.686
your skin.
When there's an injury,

00:37:57.686 --> 00:38:01.429
they get turned on and they
migrate into the wound.

00:38:01.429 --> 00:38:04.277
They migrate into this
provisional matrix and they

00:38:04.277 --> 00:38:07.988
start changing it.
They start digesting the clot

00:38:07.988 --> 00:38:12.205
and they start making new
extracellular matrix of

00:38:12.205 --> 00:38:15.429
collagen.
They do that so that there can

00:38:15.429 --> 00:38:18.900
be a pathway for these blood
vessels to regrow.

00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:22.189
The blood vessels need to
regrow, renourish the skin so

00:38:22.189 --> 00:38:25.599
that you can start to get the
normal composition back,

00:38:25.599 --> 00:38:29.913
the normal cellular components,
and you'll see these blood

00:38:29.913 --> 00:38:34.757
vessels starting to form sprouts
that enter into this provisional

00:38:34.757 --> 00:38:37.382
matrix.
Now, you've watched the

00:38:37.382 --> 00:38:41.166
process of a scar healing on
your own body and you've seen

00:38:41.166 --> 00:38:45.342
the stages that it goes through.
It will go from the red

00:38:45.342 --> 00:38:49.932
appearance to a duller red,
and eventually become a white,

00:38:49.932 --> 00:38:54.885
or it doesn't look red at all.
After some period of time you

00:38:54.885 --> 00:38:58.130
won't even see where the cut was
at all.

00:38:58.130 --> 00:39:01.246
The end process of these
fibroblasts coming in,

00:39:01.246 --> 00:39:04.499
replacing, remodeling the
matrix of blood vessels

00:39:04.499 --> 00:39:07.703
regrowing back in,
establishing new cells from the

00:39:07.703 --> 00:39:10.800
epidermis start to grow in over
this matrix in the end.

00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:13.599
First they'll grow over the top
and so you might see a little

00:39:13.599 --> 00:39:16.272
bump here.
Eventually the whole tissue

00:39:16.272 --> 00:39:20.028
through this elegant
self-regulated process heals

00:39:20.028 --> 00:39:23.550
itself so you can't see where
the cut was,

00:39:23.550 --> 00:39:27.263
we've all had that experience.
Probably we've also had the

00:39:27.263 --> 00:39:32.290
experience when we got a worse
cut and it didn't end up looking

00:39:32.290 --> 00:39:34.767
right.
You might still have a scar

00:39:34.767 --> 00:39:38.585
from some cut that you got on
your hand or your arm where it

00:39:38.585 --> 00:39:41.789
was too severe.
Now, what happened there?

00:39:41.789 --> 00:39:45.992
The same process of remodeling
happened but it happened in a

00:39:45.992 --> 00:39:50.265
more aggressive or more vigorous
way because the signals that

00:39:50.265 --> 00:39:53.800
control this were large.
It was a large wound,

00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:56.733
big problem,
lots of cells got activated,

00:39:56.733 --> 00:40:01.059
they made a lot of collagen,
they remodeled this provisional

00:40:01.059 --> 00:40:04.150
matrix very aggressively.
Why?

00:40:04.150 --> 00:40:08.105
So, that you could heal,
and so that you wouldn't have a

00:40:08.105 --> 00:40:12.205
wound here that was open to
infections or loss of blood or

00:40:12.205 --> 00:40:14.961
loss of water.
Your body knows how to

00:40:14.961 --> 00:40:18.278
respond to very severe injuries,
more severe than we usually

00:40:18.278 --> 00:40:21.690
encounter in our lives.
The result is you'll get a scar

00:40:21.690 --> 00:40:24.900
form that because the response
was too aggressive.

00:40:24.900 --> 00:40:27.761
Our ancestors,
who lived much more dangerous

00:40:27.761 --> 00:40:30.755
lives than we did,
who might get attacked by a

00:40:30.755 --> 00:40:33.382
lion or a bear,
needed to have a very

00:40:33.382 --> 00:40:37.079
aggressive healing response so
they didn't die if they got

00:40:37.079 --> 00:40:39.480
attacked under some
circumstances.

00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:43.845
We don't get attacked by lions
or bears so often anymore and so

00:40:43.845 --> 00:40:48.139
we don't necessarily need that
aggressive healing response.

00:40:48.139 --> 00:40:52.626
We might like a gentler healing
response that leads to a better

00:40:52.626 --> 00:40:56.389
functional--that doesn't have a
scar, for example.

00:40:56.389 --> 00:40:59.909
How can you control healing
in that case?

00:40:59.909 --> 00:41:04.167
Well, one of the ideas of
tissue engineering is to provide

00:41:04.167 --> 00:41:07.079
materials that would guide,
or regulate,

00:41:07.079 --> 00:41:10.590
or change that natural response
of healing.

00:41:10.590 --> 00:41:14.274
You have a wound and the wound
is going to heal on its own in

00:41:14.274 --> 00:41:16.876
some way.
You would like it to heal in

00:41:16.876 --> 00:41:21.349
way that you control so that the
outcome is more to your liking.

00:41:21.349 --> 00:41:24.439
Now, maybe the outcome is that
it heals much faster,

00:41:24.439 --> 00:41:27.590
maybe the outcome is that it
heals without a scar;

00:41:27.590 --> 00:41:32.602
maybe the outcome is that it
heals and new kinds of cells are

00:41:32.602 --> 00:41:37.364
woven into the tissue in place
of the ones that were there

00:41:37.364 --> 00:41:41.093
formerly.
Maybe this wound was created by

00:41:41.093 --> 00:41:45.867
a surgeon who removed a cancer
here, and you're trying to

00:41:45.867 --> 00:41:49.789
replace the cancer cells with
normal cells.

00:41:49.789 --> 00:41:52.090
What are the options in
terms of doing this?

00:41:52.090 --> 00:41:55.769
Well, one is that you could put
a material in here and the

00:41:55.769 --> 00:41:59.601
material goes into the wound.
That material has some

00:41:59.601 --> 00:42:04.346
function, and maybe that it
serves as a better provisional

00:42:04.346 --> 00:42:08.440
matrix then the clot would have.
'Better' means what?

00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:12.785
Maybe it regulates how cells
grow in or how cells attach,

00:42:12.785 --> 00:42:16.820
or how cells synthesize
collagen after they enter.

00:42:16.820 --> 00:42:21.088
Maybe you could design a
material that changes the

00:42:21.088 --> 00:42:25.723
healing response locally.
That's one way that you might

00:42:25.723 --> 00:42:29.211
engineer a tissue.
Now, here I haven't put any

00:42:29.211 --> 00:42:32.235
cell cultures in,
I've just put in a fancy

00:42:32.235 --> 00:42:35.915
material that I designed.
We'll talk about what those

00:42:35.915 --> 00:42:39.636
might be a little bit later.
Maybe you don't need

00:42:39.636 --> 00:42:43.196
material at all,
but maybe you could replace

00:42:43.196 --> 00:42:46.761
this with cells.
Maybe I could just take cells,

00:42:46.761 --> 00:42:50.479
maybe recovered or harvested
from some other place in the

00:42:50.479 --> 00:42:53.242
patient.
Maybe these are skin cells that

00:42:53.242 --> 00:42:57.372
I got from a normal location and
I put them back into a wound in

00:42:57.372 --> 00:43:01.110
order to speed up the process of
healing at that site.

00:43:01.110 --> 00:43:04.012
Maybe they're stem cells that
came from somewhere,

00:43:04.012 --> 00:43:07.452
or maybe they're just cells.
Often times the best

00:43:07.452 --> 00:43:12.192
combination seems to be to put
cells in together with some

00:43:12.192 --> 00:43:14.873
material.
Here, the material might

00:43:14.873 --> 00:43:17.679
function in a couple of
different ways.

00:43:17.679 --> 00:43:20.640
It might function in this way
we talked about here,

00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:24.252
by giving signals to the normal
tissue to regulate the healing

00:43:24.252 --> 00:43:26.739
response that's going to occur
anyhow.

00:43:26.739 --> 00:43:31.626
That material might contain
cells that you have derived

00:43:31.626 --> 00:43:35.789
somehow, that you want to hold
in that site;

00:43:35.789 --> 00:43:39.481
that you want to hold locally
and provide an environment where

00:43:39.481 --> 00:43:42.929
they can grow and take over the
function of the tissue.

00:43:42.929 --> 00:43:46.428
These are some sort
schematic ways to think about

00:43:46.428 --> 00:43:49.793
how one might use tissue
engineering to control the

00:43:49.793 --> 00:43:52.549
normal healing process.
I've shown this,

00:43:52.549 --> 00:43:56.191
I've given you examples of this
that--where I motivated it with

00:43:56.191 --> 00:43:59.422
thinking about the skin,
but this doesn't have to be the

00:43:59.422 --> 00:44:03.849
skin.
This could be your liver.

00:44:03.849 --> 00:44:08.783
Maybe I put a material into
your liver that allows it to

00:44:08.783 --> 00:44:11.669
regenerate.
Maybe I put liver cells derived

00:44:11.669 --> 00:44:15.051
from some other source back into
the liver, and they take over

00:44:15.051 --> 00:44:18.828
the function of the liver.
Maybe I put materials on cells

00:44:18.828 --> 00:44:23.774
and create a new liver tissue.
So, you could extend this idea

00:44:23.774 --> 00:44:29.201
to almost any tissue or organ.
Here's an example of that,

00:44:29.201 --> 00:44:34.639
where just the material is used
to guide the healing process.

00:44:34.639 --> 00:44:39.503
I think this is conceptually a
very simple idea and one that

00:44:39.503 --> 00:44:44.090
works to some extent.
This is a nerve.

00:44:44.090 --> 00:44:47.541
'Proximal' means closer to the
brain, so maybe this is a nerve

00:44:47.541 --> 00:44:51.162
in your leg and it's got severed
by some kind of injury or it got

00:44:51.162 --> 00:44:54.840
crushed and somehow the nerve is
damaged in this region here.

00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:58.569
This nerve is sending sensory
signals from the distal part,

00:44:58.569 --> 00:45:00.820
back up the nerve into the
brain;

00:45:00.820 --> 00:45:04.162
it's sending motor signals down
from the brain to the more

00:45:04.162 --> 00:45:07.291
distal regions.
If this tissue--if this nerve

00:45:07.291 --> 00:45:11.627
gets damaged by trauma somehow,
then you're not going to get

00:45:11.627 --> 00:45:15.367
sensory signals sent through it,
you're not going to get motor

00:45:15.367 --> 00:45:17.040
signals.
So, you can't feel,

00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:20.627
you can't move and all of the
tissue that's distal or

00:45:20.627 --> 00:45:24.565
downstream of that site.
How do--how would you repair

00:45:24.565 --> 00:45:26.505
that?
Well, it turns out that

00:45:26.505 --> 00:45:29.828
surgeons know that if it's a
small region and they go back in

00:45:29.828 --> 00:45:33.207
and they take the damaged ends
of the nerves and they put them

00:45:33.207 --> 00:45:36.440
back together,
you will recover much of the

00:45:36.440 --> 00:45:39.261
function of that nerve.
Maybe not 100%,

00:45:39.261 --> 00:45:43.128
but if they do it quickly and
they do it well that these cells

00:45:43.128 --> 00:45:46.869
will regrow the connections that
are lost in this section of

00:45:46.869 --> 00:45:49.883
trauma.
You will, over a period time,

00:45:49.883 --> 00:45:54.158
begin to feel in that tissue
again and you'll be able to

00:45:54.158 --> 00:45:57.134
move.
If the damage is too big,

00:45:57.134 --> 00:46:01.559
you can't physically bring them
back together.

00:46:01.559 --> 00:46:05.488
Your leg is a fixed link and if
the area of damage is too big

00:46:05.488 --> 00:46:08.500
you can't bring these tissues
back together.

00:46:08.500 --> 00:46:11.755
They found that you can use an
autograft, that is take a nerve

00:46:11.755 --> 00:46:14.542
from somewhere else.
If I cut the nerve out of

00:46:14.542 --> 00:46:18.478
another spot and then put it in
this region in between the two

00:46:18.478 --> 00:46:20.929
ends, the nerves will regrow
again.

00:46:20.929 --> 00:46:24.055
Problem with that is you don't
have a lot of nerves that you're

00:46:24.055 --> 00:46:26.228
not using.
So, in order to repair this

00:46:26.228 --> 00:46:29.190
nerve you had to sacrifice a
nerve somewhere else.

00:46:29.190 --> 00:46:31.965
Maybe you could do that
same thing with a material,

00:46:31.965 --> 00:46:33.969
so what would the material look
like?

00:46:33.969 --> 00:46:37.417
The material might look like
this, and this is just a

00:46:37.417 --> 00:46:40.599
cylindrical cuff and it's a
complete cylinder.

00:46:40.599 --> 00:46:44.053
It's shown as a cutout here
just so that you can see inside,

00:46:44.053 --> 00:46:47.389
but it's a complete cylinder
that's hollow and you put one

00:46:47.389 --> 00:46:50.902
end of the nerve into one end,
and one end of the nerve into

00:46:50.902 --> 00:46:53.239
the other.
Now, you've placed these

00:46:53.239 --> 00:46:57.053
nerves, not in physical contact,
but you've created a

00:46:57.053 --> 00:47:00.719
compartment through which they
can communicate.

00:47:00.719 --> 00:47:04.357
You don't have this end of the
nerve dangling out in space and

00:47:04.357 --> 00:47:07.099
this end of the nerve dangling
out in space.

00:47:07.099 --> 00:47:10.692
Remember it's not going to be a
nice picture like this where the

00:47:10.692 --> 00:47:14.282
nerve is existing on its own,
but there's muscles and blood

00:47:14.282 --> 00:47:17.739
vessels and other kinds of
things around in this area.

00:47:17.739 --> 00:47:21.647
By putting a channel with a
nerve in both ends you've

00:47:21.647 --> 00:47:26.231
isolated the area of the nerve
you want to regenerate from all

00:47:26.231 --> 00:47:29.190
the rest of the tissue.
Does that make sense?

00:47:29.190 --> 00:47:32.019
You hope that you get some
regrowth through here.

00:47:32.019 --> 00:47:35.800
What scientists have found
is that if you do this you will

00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:39.388
get some regrowth.
You don't get complete regrowth

00:47:39.388 --> 00:47:42.873
of a thick nerve,
but you get a thin nerve with

00:47:42.873 --> 00:47:45.672
less fibers,
less nerve tissue,

00:47:45.672 --> 00:47:49.460
less function but you get some
recovery.

00:47:49.460 --> 00:47:51.951
So it works,
and we've known for about 20

00:47:51.951 --> 00:47:55.502
years or so that it works but it
doesn't work well enough,

00:47:55.502 --> 00:47:59.294
so how could I make it better.
Well, one way you could make it

00:47:59.294 --> 00:48:01.239
better is by changing the
material.

00:48:01.239 --> 00:48:04.189
Maybe the properties of the
material weren't right,

00:48:04.189 --> 00:48:07.550
maybe the cuff on the outside
is too impermeable and you'd

00:48:07.550 --> 00:48:10.500
like to have molecules
exchanging in some way.

00:48:10.500 --> 00:48:14.354
Maybe it's not permeable enough
and so you need to regulate it

00:48:14.354 --> 00:48:16.722
that way.
Maybe you don't want a nerve

00:48:16.722 --> 00:48:19.590
cuff that's filled with just air
or just water,

00:48:19.590 --> 00:48:24.307
but maybe you'd like a nerve
conduit that's filled with a

00:48:24.307 --> 00:48:29.193
material that promotes the
growth and reconnection of these

00:48:29.193 --> 00:48:32.486
fibers.
Maybe you'd like some kind of a

00:48:32.486 --> 00:48:36.380
gel in there that nerves could
regenerate through.

00:48:36.380 --> 00:48:39.792
So, the obvious place to go
for that is to use the kinds of

00:48:39.792 --> 00:48:42.710
materials that the body uses for
repairing tissues.

00:48:42.710 --> 00:48:47.956
Fill up this channel not just
with water or saline,

00:48:47.956 --> 00:48:52.150
or some kind of a solution,
but fill it up with an

00:48:52.150 --> 00:48:54.817
extracellular matrix,
like the kind of extracellular

00:48:54.817 --> 00:48:56.700
matrix we talked about weeks
ago,

00:48:56.700 --> 00:49:00.308
that all of your tissues have.
A supporting gel like

00:49:00.308 --> 00:49:04.810
structure, formed from proteins
and carbohydrates that are

00:49:04.810 --> 00:49:08.048
secreted by cells,
and through which cells

00:49:08.048 --> 00:49:12.161
normally grow and live.
Taking natural proteins like

00:49:12.161 --> 00:49:15.963
collagen, forming gels out of
them and putting these gels

00:49:15.963 --> 00:49:19.968
inside the material increases
the number of fibers that grow

00:49:19.968 --> 00:49:24.037
across a gap like that.
This is just an example

00:49:24.037 --> 00:49:27.890
of--a simple example,
no cells involved here of a

00:49:27.890 --> 00:49:32.546
material that's designed in
order to enhance the healing of

00:49:32.546 --> 00:49:36.720
a wound and how one might
engineer properties of that

00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:42.260
material to make it better at
supporting the healing function.

00:49:42.260 --> 00:49:45.378
That's what I wanted to say
about tissue engineering

00:49:45.378 --> 00:49:49.230
involves control or regulation
of the normal healing process.

00:49:49.230 --> 00:49:53.945
I want you to keep that in mind
as we go through the examples

00:49:53.945 --> 00:49:57.560
that we'll talk about in
Thursday's lecture.

00:49:57.560 --> 00:50:01.620
I'm going to stop there.
Questions?

00:50:05.180 --> 00:50:06.646
See you on Thursday.

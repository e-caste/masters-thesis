00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.941
Professor Christine
Hayes: We were talking last

00:00:02.941 --> 00:00:05.459
time about evidence of the use
of different sources in the

00:00:05.459 --> 00:00:07.403
biblical text,
and I mentioned Richard Simon,

00:00:07.403 --> 00:00:10.142
who was the first to argue that
perhaps Moses wasn't the author

00:00:10.142 --> 00:00:11.380
of the entire Torah.
 

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:15.298
In the mid-eighteenth century a
fellow named Jean Astruc first

00:00:15.298 --> 00:00:18.895
noticed the use of the name
Yahweh in certain stories and

00:00:18.895 --> 00:00:21.520
passages,
and the name Elohim in others.

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.250
And on this basis he came,
and others came,

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.410
to identify what have come to
be known as the J and E sources.

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.951
J being pronounced "y" in
German, as a "Y," so Yahweh is

00:00:32.951 --> 00:00:34.520
spelt with a "J".
 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.160
So the J and the E sources.
 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.558
Now Astruc actually happened to
maintain the idea of Mosaic

00:00:39.558 --> 00:00:42.243
authorship.
He argued the Moses was drawing

00:00:42.243 --> 00:00:45.471
from two separate long
documents, which he identified

00:00:45.471 --> 00:00:47.930
as J and E.
They used different names for

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.550
God, and he was drawing on those
in his composition of the Torah.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.834
But in the next century his
work would be expanded by

00:00:54.834 --> 00:00:58.118
Germans who identified other
sources that made up the

00:00:58.118 --> 00:01:01.014
Pentateuch especially,
the first five books of the

00:01:01.014 --> 00:01:01.850
Bible especially.
 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.337
And in 1878 we have the classic
statement of biblical source

00:01:06.337 --> 00:01:09.379
theory published by Julius
Wellhausen.

00:01:09.379 --> 00:01:11.831
He wrote a work called The
History of Israel,

00:01:11.831 --> 00:01:14.860
and he presented what is known
as the Documentary Hypothesis.

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.010
Now you've read a little bit
about this in your source

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:21.101
readings, but it's the
hypothesis that the historical

00:01:21.101 --> 00:01:24.668
or narrative sections of the
Bible--Genesis and stretching on

00:01:24.668 --> 00:01:27.997
really through 2 Kings--is
comprised of four identifiable

00:01:27.997 --> 00:01:31.980
source documents that have been
woven together in some way.

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.513
And he argued that these
documents date to different

00:01:35.513 --> 00:01:38.769
periods and reflect very
different interests and

00:01:38.769 --> 00:01:41.774
concerns.
These four prior documents,

00:01:41.774 --> 00:01:46.140
he says, were woven together by
somebody or some group of

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.349
somebodies to form the narrative
core of the Bible.

00:01:50.349 --> 00:01:55.032
Wellhausen argued that these
sources therefore do not tell us

00:01:55.032 --> 00:01:59.480
about the times or situations
they purport to describe,

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.559
so much as they tell us about
the beliefs and practices of

00:02:02.559 --> 00:02:05.530
Israelites in the period in
which they were composed.

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.010
This is going to be an
important claim;

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:10.449
this is an important predicate
of the documentary hypothesis.

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:13.593
So although the sources claim
to talk about events from

00:02:13.593 --> 00:02:15.340
creation, actually,
forward,

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.429
Wellhausen says,
no, they really can only be

00:02:18.429 --> 00:02:22.380
used to tell us about the
beliefs and religion of Israel

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.146
from the tenth century,
which is when he thinks the

00:02:26.146 --> 00:02:28.379
oldest was written,
and forward.

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:30.379
Now his work created a
sensation.

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:33.917
It undermined of course
traditional claims about the

00:02:33.917 --> 00:02:36.830
authorship of God and the work
of Moses.

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.378
It's still disputed by
conservative groups and Roman

00:02:40.378 --> 00:02:43.439
Catholic authorities,
although Roman Catholic

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:46.569
scholars certainly teach it and
adopt it.

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:49.297
The four sources that were
identified by Wellhausen are,

00:02:49.297 --> 00:02:51.430
as I said, the J source and the
E source,

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.767
but also P, the priestly
source, and D,

00:02:54.767 --> 00:02:58.720
which is primarily the book of
Deuteronomy.

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.810
Now as I said the first two
sources are named because of the

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.796
names of God that they employ,
but it goes a little deeper

00:03:04.796 --> 00:03:06.616
then that.
According to J,

00:03:06.616 --> 00:03:09.802
the knowledge of the proper or
personal name,

00:03:09.802 --> 00:03:11.757
if you will,
of God, Yahweh,

00:03:11.757 --> 00:03:15.740
begins with the first human,
with the adam.

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:19.080
So already in Genesis 4,
adam seems to know this

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.370
name and refer to God by this
name.

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:24.625
If we look at other sources
such as P and even E,

00:03:24.625 --> 00:03:28.559
Yahweh's name is not known to
humankind until he chooses to

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:31.691
reveal it to Moses,
and this happens in the time of

00:03:31.691 --> 00:03:33.895
the Exodus.
So in Exodus 6:2-3,

00:03:33.895 --> 00:03:38.178
which is assigned by source
critics to the P source,

00:03:38.178 --> 00:03:42.402
the Priestly source,
God appears to Moses and he

00:03:42.402 --> 00:03:45.460
tells Moses then that he is
Yahweh.

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:49.094
He says, "I appeared to
Abraham, Isaac and Jacob," the

00:03:49.094 --> 00:03:51.942
patriarchs before you,
"as El Shaddai,

00:03:51.942 --> 00:03:55.708
but I did not make myself known
to them by name,

00:03:55.708 --> 00:03:57.920
Yahweh."
So the P source has a different

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.164
sort of theology,
if you will,

00:03:59.164 --> 00:04:00.880
of God's name,
or the revelation of God's

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.366
name.
And the same sort of thing

00:04:03.366 --> 00:04:07.638
happens in Exodus 3:13-16,
and that's assigned to the E

00:04:07.638 --> 00:04:10.172
source.
So once you've identified rough

00:04:10.172 --> 00:04:13.600
blocks of material according to
not just the name of the deity

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.197
but also their assumptions about
when humankind knows the name of

00:04:17.197 --> 00:04:20.069
the deity,
then you can analyze these

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:24.207
blocks or chunks of text and
begin to identify certain

00:04:24.207 --> 00:04:27.330
characteristic features:
their style,

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:28.920
the terminology they use.
 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.937
Source critics were able to
come up with a list of what they

00:04:31.937 --> 00:04:34.596
believed were the main
characteristics of the various

00:04:34.596 --> 00:04:37.030
sources.
So the main characteristics of

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:39.517
the J source,
which begins with the second

00:04:39.517 --> 00:04:42.416
creation story,
so the J source picks up in

00:04:42.416 --> 00:04:46.298
Genesis 2:4, second half of
verse 4 are: (1) that it uses a

00:04:46.298 --> 00:04:50.180
personal name Yahweh for God
from the time of creation,

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.259
and that will be in your Bibles
as "Lord";

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:56.220
(2) It describes God very
anthropomorphically.

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:59.658
It's the J source that has God
shut the door of the ark after

00:04:59.658 --> 00:05:01.912
Noah.
It's the J source that has God

00:05:01.912 --> 00:05:05.742
smelling the sacrifice after the
Flood, the sacrifice that Noah

00:05:05.742 --> 00:05:07.867
offers.
It's in the J source that God

00:05:07.867 --> 00:05:10.000
eats with Abraham and bargains
with him.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.035
It's in the J source that God
meets with Moses in this

00:05:13.035 --> 00:05:16.069
mysterious passage and tries to
kill him one night;

00:05:16.069 --> 00:05:19.930
(3) J has a very vivid and
concrete earthy style;

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:24.678
and, (4) It uses the name Mount
Sinai to refer to the place

00:05:24.678 --> 00:05:29.754
where the Israelites with Moses
will conclude the covenant with

00:05:29.754 --> 00:05:31.970
God.
As for the date?

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:35.618
Well source critics felt that a
clue to the dating of the J

00:05:35.618 --> 00:05:39.329
source could be found in the
passage in which God promises a

00:05:39.329 --> 00:05:42.160
grant of national land to the
Israelites.

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:45.707
The boundaries of the land are
given there as the River of

00:05:45.707 --> 00:05:48.009
Egypt, the Nile,
and the Euphrates.

00:05:48.009 --> 00:05:52.027
It was argued by some that
those were basically the borders

00:05:52.027 --> 00:05:55.560
of the Kingdom of Israel under
David and Solomon.

00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:00.024
Think of 1000 as your date for
David, that's basically when the

00:06:00.024 --> 00:06:03.151
monarchy begins.
So the beginning of the tenth

00:06:03.151 --> 00:06:05.293
century.
The argument is that under

00:06:05.293 --> 00:06:08.682
David and Solomon the empire
reached that boundary and so

00:06:08.682 --> 00:06:12.312
clearly this is a writer from
the tenth century who's seeking

00:06:12.312 --> 00:06:16.064
to justify Israel's possession
of its kingdom from the River of

00:06:16.064 --> 00:06:19.862
Egypt to the Euphrates;
it's presenting that kingdom as

00:06:19.862 --> 00:06:23.636
a fulfillment of a promise of
land that God made to Israel's

00:06:23.636 --> 00:06:24.980
ancient ancestors.
 

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:28.395
For that reason source critics
thought J must date to about the

00:06:28.395 --> 00:06:31.480
tenth century and to the time of
perhaps King Solomon.

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:34.569
It also seems to reflect the
interests of the south.

00:06:34.569 --> 00:06:37.661
Remember, we talked about the
fact briefly that at a certain

00:06:37.661 --> 00:06:40.909
point in Israel's history there
is a division upon the death of

00:06:40.909 --> 00:06:42.899
Solomon in the late tenth
century.

00:06:42.899 --> 00:06:46.144
The kingdom divides into a
northern kingdom now called

00:06:46.144 --> 00:06:49.389
Israel and a southern smaller
kingdom called Judah.

00:06:49.389 --> 00:06:53.098
And the southern interests seem
to be reflected in the J

00:06:53.098 --> 00:06:56.040
document.
So source critics decided this

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:59.339
is a Judean document from the
tenth century.

00:06:59.339 --> 00:07:02.299
The E source,
which source critics say begins

00:07:02.299 --> 00:07:05.730
around Genesis 15 is really the
most fragmentary.

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:10.180
It seems to have been used to
supplement the J source rather

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:12.819
than being used in a larger
form.

00:07:12.819 --> 00:07:14.905
So sometimes it seems very
difficult to isolate,

00:07:14.905 --> 00:07:16.680
and there's a lot of debate
over this,

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:19.862
but the E source's
characteristics are that (1) it

00:07:19.862 --> 00:07:24.019
uses Elohim, again it's a plural
form of the word god or gods,

00:07:24.019 --> 00:07:26.932
but when it's used with a
singular verb it refers to the

00:07:26.932 --> 00:07:29.363
God of Israel;
(2) it has a much less

00:07:29.363 --> 00:07:33.079
anthropomorphic view of God;
(3) God is more remote.

00:07:33.079 --> 00:07:37.076
There aren't the direct
face-to-face revelations in the

00:07:37.076 --> 00:07:39.901
E source;
most communications from the

00:07:39.901 --> 00:07:41.410
divine are indirect.
 

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:44.529
They'll be through messengers
or dreams and;

00:07:44.529 --> 00:07:49.209
(4) there's also an emphasis on
prophets and prophecy in the E

00:07:49.209 --> 00:07:51.496
source.
Miriam, Moses--they're both

00:07:51.496 --> 00:07:53.920
referred to as prophets in the E
source;

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:58.579
(5) The style is more abstract,
a little less picturesque,

00:07:58.579 --> 00:08:00.232
and;
(6) the E source uses a

00:08:00.232 --> 00:08:02.912
different name for the mountain
where the covenant was

00:08:02.912 --> 00:08:05.920
concluded.
It uses the name Horeb.

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:08.002
So you will sometimes see as
you are reading the text,

00:08:08.002 --> 00:08:10.360
they will sometimes refer to
Horeb instead of Mount Sinai,

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:12.629
or you'll see the two names
used interchangeably.

00:08:12.629 --> 00:08:15.729
And it's been the theory of
scholars that that's because it

00:08:15.729 --> 00:08:17.439
comes from a different source.
 

00:08:17.439 --> 00:08:21.039
The E source seems to be
concerned primarily with the

00:08:21.039 --> 00:08:24.500
northern tribes,
therefore the northern kingdom.

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:28.263
And so source theorists decided
that it was most likely composed

00:08:28.263 --> 00:08:31.310
in the northern kingdoms about
the ninth century.

00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:34.300
And then, according to this
hypothesis, the J and E sources

00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:36.517
were combined,
primarily J with E being used

00:08:36.517 --> 00:08:39.368
to supplement it,
probably somewhere in the eight

00:08:39.368 --> 00:08:42.914
century, late eighth century;
and that was the backbone of

00:08:42.914 --> 00:08:44.750
the Pentateuchal narrative.
 

00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:48.160
It covers the early history of
humankind, of Israel's early

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:51.159
ancestors known as the
patriarchs and matriarchs.

00:08:51.159 --> 00:08:52.879
Their stories are told in
Genesis.

00:08:52.879 --> 00:08:56.990
It contained the story of Moses
and the exodus from Egypt in the

00:08:56.990 --> 00:08:59.175
book of Exodus,
and the stories of the

00:08:59.175 --> 00:09:01.912
wandering in the wilderness that
are found in the book of

00:09:01.912 --> 00:09:04.526
Numbers.
The anonymous scribe or editor

00:09:04.526 --> 00:09:08.057
who combined these sources
didn't care to remove any

00:09:08.057 --> 00:09:11.380
redundant material or
contradictory material,

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:13.169
as we've already seen.
 

00:09:13.169 --> 00:09:17.343
Now there are two other sources
according to classical source

00:09:17.343 --> 00:09:19.570
theory, and these are D and P.
 

00:09:19.570 --> 00:09:24.856
D, which is the Deuteronomic
source, is essentially the book

00:09:24.856 --> 00:09:27.914
of Deuteronomy.
The book of Deuteronomy differs

00:09:27.914 --> 00:09:29.300
from the narrative sources.
 

00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:31.129
This is a book of speeches.
 

00:09:31.129 --> 00:09:34.896
The book purports to be three
speeches delivered by Moses as

00:09:34.896 --> 00:09:38.983
the Israelites are poised on the
east side of the Jordan River…

00:09:38.983 --> 00:09:42.766
I'm not good with directions;
I had to stop and think… the

00:09:42.766 --> 00:09:45.952
east side of the Jordan River,
about to enter the Promised

00:09:45.952 --> 00:09:48.142
Land.
But according to the source

00:09:48.142 --> 00:09:51.562
theorists it clearly reflects
the interests of settled

00:09:51.562 --> 00:09:53.524
agrarian life.
It doesn't reflect the

00:09:53.524 --> 00:09:55.450
interests of people who have
been wandering around

00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:57.308
nomadically.
It has laws that deal with

00:09:57.308 --> 00:09:58.429
settled agrarian life.
 

00:09:58.429 --> 00:10:03.595
The main characteristic of D,
however, which assisted source

00:10:03.595 --> 00:10:07.721
theorists in fixing its date,
is the following:

00:10:07.721 --> 00:10:12.455
D is the one source in the
Bible that clearly insists that

00:10:12.455 --> 00:10:16.940
one central sanctuary only is
acceptable to Yahweh.

00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:21.080
God cannot be worshiped at
makeshift altars.

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:25.691
God cannot be worshipped
through sacrifices at some local

00:10:25.691 --> 00:10:28.918
sanctuary;
all sacrifices must be offered

00:10:28.918 --> 00:10:33.394
in the one central sanctuary
where "he will cause his name to

00:10:33.394 --> 00:10:35.454
dwell."
It doesn't actually ever say

00:10:35.454 --> 00:10:37.895
Jerusalem, which is why
Samaritans think that it's at

00:10:37.895 --> 00:10:40.664
Mount Gerizim and that they have
the correct temple and that

00:10:40.664 --> 00:10:42.730
they're authorized to offer
sacrifices.

00:10:42.730 --> 00:10:45.039
They got it wrong when they
thought it was Jerusalem;

00:10:45.039 --> 00:10:47.942
Samaritans think that that is
where God caused his name to

00:10:47.942 --> 00:10:49.746
dwell.
So Jerusalem is not actually

00:10:49.746 --> 00:10:52.240
mentioned in Deuteronomy,
that's a later reading,

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:54.601
but the place where God will
cause his name to dwell,

00:10:54.601 --> 00:10:57.700
and only at the temple there,
can there be sacrifices.

00:10:57.700 --> 00:11:00.196
This is a very different
perspective from other biblical

00:11:00.196 --> 00:11:01.567
books.
So you're going to see in the

00:11:01.567 --> 00:11:03.720
stories of the patriarchs that
they're wandering all around the

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:05.110
land and they're offering
sacrifices.

00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:07.630
There are other books too where
it's clear that there are local

00:11:07.630 --> 00:11:10.342
shrines, local sanctuaries,
local priests who are offering

00:11:10.342 --> 00:11:12.539
sacrifices for people throughout
the land.

00:11:12.539 --> 00:11:15.600
But Deuteronomy insists:
one central sanctuary.

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:19.549
All of the outlying alters and
sacred places must be destroyed.

00:11:19.549 --> 00:11:25.325
Now centralization of the cult
was a key part of the religious

00:11:25.325 --> 00:11:28.639
reform of a king of Judah in
622.

00:11:28.639 --> 00:11:32.690
I've marked a couple of dates
on the timeline up here:

00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:37.275
722 is the fall of the Northern
Kingdom, 622 a reform by King

00:11:37.275 --> 00:11:38.879
Josiah in Judah .
 

00:11:38.879 --> 00:11:43.240
We read about this in one of
the historical narratives where

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:45.679
the temple's being refurbished.
 

00:11:45.679 --> 00:11:48.240
A book is found that says one
central sanctuary.

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:50.179
King Josiah says:
What have we been doing?

00:11:50.179 --> 00:11:52.970
Get rid of the outlying altars,
everything has to be

00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:54.009
centralized here.
 

00:11:54.009 --> 00:11:58.256
So that reform,
Josiah's reform has caused many

00:11:58.256 --> 00:12:01.580
scholars to associate
Deuteronomy,

00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:06.155
the centralizing book or
source, with the late-seventh

00:12:06.155 --> 00:12:09.350
century, around this time in
Judah.

00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:12.350
The trouble is D seems to
reflect a lot of northern

00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:15.889
traditions, the interests of
tribes who are in the north.

00:12:15.889 --> 00:12:18.740
Well the Northern Kingdom was
destroyed in 722;

00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:21.744
so this is the theory:
source critics conclude that D

00:12:21.744 --> 00:12:25.037
is an old source that was
originally composed in the north

00:12:25.037 --> 00:12:26.539
in the eighth century.
 

00:12:26.539 --> 00:12:30.245
When the northern kingdom fell,
when the Assyrians conquered

00:12:30.245 --> 00:12:34.139
and many Israelites would have
fled to the southern kingdom,

00:12:34.139 --> 00:12:37.698
Deuteronomy or the D source was
brought to Jerusalem,

00:12:37.698 --> 00:12:41.393
stored in the temple where a
hundred years later it was

00:12:41.393 --> 00:12:44.472
discovered and its
centralization was put into

00:12:44.472 --> 00:12:46.320
force by King Josiah.
 

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:50.310
P is the Priestly source,
and that is found mostly in the

00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:53.944
books of Leviticus and the
non-narrative portions of

00:12:53.944 --> 00:12:56.712
Numbers.
Now the major characteristics

00:12:56.712 --> 00:13:00.274
of P, the Priestly source,
are (1) a great concern with

00:13:00.274 --> 00:13:04.293
religious institutions,
with the sacrificial system,

00:13:04.293 --> 00:13:06.843
with the Sabbath,
with holidays,

00:13:06.843 --> 00:13:10.714
with rituals like circumcision,
the Passover,

00:13:10.714 --> 00:13:15.840
dietary restrictions (the laws
of kashrut) the system of

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:19.929
ritual purity and impurity,
and also holiness,

00:13:19.929 --> 00:13:24.220
ethical holiness and cultic or
ritual holiness.

00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:27.346
P does have some narrative,
and you've read some of it:

00:13:27.346 --> 00:13:30.820
Genesis 1, the first creation
account, is attributed to P.

00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:32.891
It's orderly,
it's systematized,

00:13:32.891 --> 00:13:35.429
the god is extraordinarily
abstract.

00:13:35.429 --> 00:13:37.960
Because in the P source another
characteristic is that;

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:40.968
(2) God is transcendent,
and even perhaps remote,

00:13:40.968 --> 00:13:43.350
much more so than in J,
for example.

00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:47.495
Generally in the P source,
God is concealed and revealed

00:13:47.495 --> 00:13:49.530
only in his kavod.
 

00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:56.000
 
 

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:01.126
This is a word that's often
translated as "glory," but what

00:14:01.126 --> 00:14:05.370
it refers to actually is a
light-filled cloud.

00:14:05.370 --> 00:14:08.581
God seems to be the burning
fire inside this light-filled

00:14:08.581 --> 00:14:09.771
cloud.
He travels before the

00:14:09.771 --> 00:14:11.443
Israelites in that form,
leading them through the

00:14:11.443 --> 00:14:12.279
wilderness and so on.
 

00:14:12.279 --> 00:14:14.809
That seems to be in the P
source.

00:14:14.809 --> 00:14:19.107
P is also; (3) interested in
covenants, in censuses,

00:14:19.107 --> 00:14:22.281
in genealogies.
All of those sections very

00:14:22.281 --> 00:14:26.100
often that link stories,
are attributed to the P source.

00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:29.862
And because P elements often
serve that kind of function as a

00:14:29.862 --> 00:14:33.338
bridge between stories,
or very often P sources seem to

00:14:33.338 --> 00:14:37.094
introduce a story or conclude a
story, the source critics felt

00:14:37.094 --> 00:14:40.419
that priestly writers were
probably responsible for the

00:14:40.419 --> 00:14:44.648
final editing of the Bible,
bringing together J and E and D

00:14:44.648 --> 00:14:48.799
and adding their materials and
finally editing the work.

00:14:48.799 --> 00:14:52.776
Now, Wellhausen dated the
priestly source to the exilic

00:14:52.776 --> 00:14:57.121
period, the period after the
fall of the Southern Kingdom in

00:14:57.121 --> 00:15:01.466
586 when the Babylonians have
taken many of the Judeans into

00:15:01.466 --> 00:15:03.159
exile in Babylon.
 

00:15:03.159 --> 00:15:08.746
So the narrative parts of P,
J and E are continuous parallel

00:15:08.746 --> 00:15:12.440
accounts of the history of the
world,

00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:16.011
if you will,
from creation until the death

00:15:16.011 --> 00:15:18.787
of Moses.
Source critics believe that

00:15:18.787 --> 00:15:21.815
they have a uniform style,
uniform vocabulary,

00:15:21.815 --> 00:15:25.450
uniform set of themes,
and chronological framework.

00:15:25.450 --> 00:15:28.626
So according to Wellhausen,
and I sort of schematized it

00:15:28.626 --> 00:15:32.053
chronologically for you up here,
the priestly school drew

00:15:32.053 --> 00:15:35.529
together all of this older
material, added some of its own

00:15:35.529 --> 00:15:38.401
editorial material--bridges,
introductions,

00:15:38.401 --> 00:15:42.748
conclusions--inserted the large
priestly documents of Leviticus

00:15:42.748 --> 00:15:45.919
and Numbers,
and so the Torah--and they did

00:15:45.919 --> 00:15:49.592
this sitting in exile in
Babylon--and so the Torah is

00:15:49.592 --> 00:15:53.195
really the result of five
centuries of religious and

00:15:53.195 --> 00:15:54.820
literary activity.
 

00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:57.603
And this of course is a very,
very different portrait from

00:15:57.603 --> 00:16:00.484
traditional claims about the
authorship of the Pentateuch by

00:16:00.484 --> 00:16:03.288
one man,
Moses, in approximately the

00:16:03.288 --> 00:16:05.259
fourteenth century BCE.
 

00:16:05.259 --> 00:16:08.643
There are different terms that
we use to describe the modern,

00:16:08.643 --> 00:16:12.027
critical study of the Bible in
the late nineteenth century as

00:16:12.027 --> 00:16:13.549
I've just described it.
 

00:16:13.549 --> 00:16:17.517
One term is literary criticism,
because it proceeds by closely

00:16:17.517 --> 00:16:21.419
analyzing the literary features
of the text: the terminology,

00:16:21.419 --> 00:16:23.110
the style, the motifs.
 

00:16:23.110 --> 00:16:27.386
But because the goal of this
literary critical school was to

00:16:27.386 --> 00:16:30.430
identify specific sources,
isolate sources,

00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:33.620
we also refer to it as source
criticism.

00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:36.143
You'll see those terms used
interchangeably in your

00:16:36.143 --> 00:16:38.471
literature.
Today literary criticism has a

00:16:38.471 --> 00:16:41.423
slightly different connotation
from what it was in the

00:16:41.423 --> 00:16:43.874
nineteenth century,
so people prefer the term

00:16:43.874 --> 00:16:45.100
source criticism.
 

00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:46.960
But you should know both are
used.

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:50.279
However, the purpose of
identifying and isolating these

00:16:50.279 --> 00:16:52.862
sources was not just to say,
"Look at that,

00:16:52.862 --> 00:16:55.259
there are these different
sources."

00:16:55.259 --> 00:16:59.522
The purpose was to ascertain as
far as possible their relative

00:16:59.522 --> 00:17:03.044
dates to one another,
and to therefore enable the

00:17:03.044 --> 00:17:06.164
work of historical
reconstruction to proceed:

00:17:06.164 --> 00:17:10.349
primarily a reconstruction of
the history of the religion of

00:17:10.349 --> 00:17:13.185
Israel,
and the historical situation of

00:17:13.185 --> 00:17:15.619
the authors of the different
sources.

00:17:15.619 --> 00:17:19.199
Therefore literary criticism is
not only called source

00:17:19.199 --> 00:17:21.680
criticism.
It's also called historical

00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:25.577
criticism, because its ultimate
goal and purpose was not just to

00:17:25.577 --> 00:17:29.316
isolate the sources,
but to arrange them according

00:17:29.316 --> 00:17:33.710
to relative dates as far as they
might be ascertained,

00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:38.480
and then to chart changes in
Israel's religion.

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:41.544
You have a very readable
introduction to some of this in

00:17:41.544 --> 00:17:43.160
Norman Habel's little work.
 

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:47.075
Another excellent work which is
not on your syllabus that is

00:17:47.075 --> 00:17:51.390
also critical of Wellhausen and
some of the biases in his work,

00:17:51.390 --> 00:17:54.605
is found in a little work
called Who Wrote the

00:17:54.605 --> 00:17:57.847
Bible by Richard Friedman,
which has a great cover because

00:17:57.847 --> 00:17:59.830
it says "Who Wrote the
Bible? Richard Friedman,"

00:17:59.830 --> 00:18:03.099
[audience laughter].
 

00:18:03.099 --> 00:18:06.890
So to sum up:
the documentary hypothesis is

00:18:06.890 --> 00:18:10.680
an effort to explain the
contradictions,

00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:14.003
the doublets,
anachronisms and so on in the

00:18:14.003 --> 00:18:17.960
Bible by means of hypothetical
source documents.

00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:20.232
So the theory posits
hypothetical sources,

00:18:20.232 --> 00:18:23.502
traditions and documents to
explain the current shape of the

00:18:23.502 --> 00:18:26.563
Torah the way we have it,
to account for some of these

00:18:26.563 --> 00:18:27.809
phenomena that we find.
 

00:18:27.809 --> 00:18:31.459
As a next step the sources are
assigned relative dates,

00:18:31.459 --> 00:18:33.960
not absolute dates,
relative dates,

00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:37.286
and then they're analyzed to
reveal the different stages of

00:18:37.286 --> 00:18:38.950
Israel's religious history.
 

00:18:38.950 --> 00:18:42.489
And so source criticism is also
known as historical criticism

00:18:42.489 --> 00:18:45.380
because it's a tool for getting
at the history,

00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:47.967
not just at the text,
but ultimately a history of

00:18:47.967 --> 00:18:49.100
Israelite religion.
 

00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:51.410
That is how it has been used.
 

00:18:51.410 --> 00:18:56.180
Now Wellhausen's work is subtle
and it's quite brilliant,

00:18:56.180 --> 00:19:00.780
but it certainly reflects
biases of nineteenth- century

00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:05.019
German scholarship,
which believed strongly in the

00:19:05.019 --> 00:19:08.210
superiority of Christianity over
Judaism.

00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:11.356
In his writings Wellhausen has
some things to say about Judaism

00:19:11.356 --> 00:19:12.930
that are none too flattering.
 

00:19:12.930 --> 00:19:17.021
He describes Judaism at the end
of the biblical period as a dead

00:19:17.021 --> 00:19:18.970
tree, twisted and perverted.
 

00:19:18.970 --> 00:19:23.295
He especially harbored a
distaste for things cultic:

00:19:23.295 --> 00:19:26.857
priests, cult,
ritual, in keeping with what

00:19:26.857 --> 00:19:30.250
was going on in Germany at the
time,

00:19:30.250 --> 00:19:33.849
and the Protestant movement and
so on.

00:19:33.849 --> 00:19:37.472
And these sorts of biases are
very apparent in his work,

00:19:37.472 --> 00:19:40.700
and very apparent in his dating
of the sources,

00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:44.452
and in his description of the
evolutionary stages of Israel's

00:19:44.452 --> 00:19:46.114
religion.
So for example,

00:19:46.114 --> 00:19:49.426
source critics before
Wellhausen all thought that P,

00:19:49.426 --> 00:19:52.641
the priestly material,
was some of the oldest material

00:19:52.641 --> 00:19:54.849
in the Bible,
that it was an early source.

00:19:54.849 --> 00:19:58.666
But Wellhausen said no,
it must be a late source,

00:19:58.666 --> 00:20:02.483
because priestly,
cultic, ritual material--that's

00:20:02.483 --> 00:20:07.095
clearly a degenerate stage of
religion that shows a sort of

00:20:07.095 --> 00:20:09.559
guilt-ridden behaviorism.
 

00:20:09.559 --> 00:20:13.972
It's not true of spiritual
religion, so clearly that's the

00:20:13.972 --> 00:20:18.152
latest stage of Israelite
religion when it had died and

00:20:18.152 --> 00:20:23.029
was waiting to be reborn in new
form with the arrival of someone

00:20:23.029 --> 00:20:25.119
in the first century.
 

00:20:25.119 --> 00:20:30.780
Clearly his dating of P owes a
great deal to his biases and

00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:32.829
religious ideology.
 

00:20:32.829 --> 00:20:37.551
He saw the priestly material as
having to come from the -exilic

00:20:37.551 --> 00:20:40.377
age, post 586,
and this is one of Wellhausen's

00:20:40.377 --> 00:20:43.490
most controversial points that's
still hotly debated today,

00:20:43.490 --> 00:20:47.020
and we're going to return to
this debate when we actually

00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:49.480
take a look at Leviticus and
Numbers.

00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:52.606
At that time we'll be able to
see what's at stake in the whole

00:20:52.606 --> 00:20:55.170
question of the dating of the
priestly material.

00:20:55.170 --> 00:20:59.052
The historical critical method,
and the documentary hypothesis

00:20:59.052 --> 00:21:01.599
in particular,
are not inherently biased,

00:21:01.599 --> 00:21:04.400
I want to make that point very
strongly.

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:08.125
They are simply analytical
tools: look at the text and its

00:21:08.125 --> 00:21:11.655
features and draw some
conclusions based on what you're

00:21:11.655 --> 00:21:13.881
finding.
They are simply analytical

00:21:13.881 --> 00:21:16.109
tools.
They're not inherently biased.

00:21:16.109 --> 00:21:19.196
They can be applied fairly to
the text, and they're

00:21:19.196 --> 00:21:20.740
extraordinarily useful.
 

00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:23.916
It's just that some of the
earlier practitioners of these

00:21:23.916 --> 00:21:26.298
methods did have ideological
axes to grind,

00:21:26.298 --> 00:21:28.339
and we need to be aware of
that.

00:21:28.339 --> 00:21:32.241
The documentary hypothesis
works fairly well when you have

00:21:32.241 --> 00:21:33.609
parallel accounts.
 

00:21:33.609 --> 00:21:37.707
It works a little bit less well
when the accounts are interwoven

00:21:37.707 --> 00:21:41.674
because sometimes picking apart
the sources can become dry and

00:21:41.674 --> 00:21:44.219
mechanical,
sometimes to the point of

00:21:44.219 --> 00:21:46.424
absurdity.
Some of the people who have

00:21:46.424 --> 00:21:49.396
carried this method to its
extreme will go through and

00:21:49.396 --> 00:21:52.779
almost word for word--this is J,
this is E, the next word is

00:21:52.779 --> 00:21:55.986
P… it's quite remarkable how
certain they feel that they can

00:21:55.986 --> 00:21:58.931
break things down almost on a
word-to-word basis as if an

00:21:58.931 --> 00:22:01.349
editor sat there with scissors
and paste,

00:22:01.349 --> 00:22:03.859
cutting out word for word,
and putting them together.

00:22:03.859 --> 00:22:06.654
It sometimes can reach heights
of absurdity,

00:22:06.654 --> 00:22:10.619
and it can really destroy the
power of a magnificent story,

00:22:10.619 --> 00:22:13.349
sometimes, when you carve it up
into pieces that on their own

00:22:13.349 --> 00:22:15.170
don't really make all that much
sense.

00:22:15.170 --> 00:22:18.978
It needs to be remembered that
the documentary hypothesis is

00:22:18.978 --> 00:22:20.269
only a hypothesis.
 

00:22:20.269 --> 00:22:23.403
An important and a useful one,
and I certainly have used it

00:22:23.403 --> 00:22:26.158
myself.
But none of the sources posited

00:22:26.158 --> 00:22:29.743
by critical scholars has been
found independently:

00:22:29.743 --> 00:22:33.059
we have no copy of J,
we have no copy of E,

00:22:33.059 --> 00:22:36.549
we have no copy of P by itself
or D by itself.

00:22:36.549 --> 00:22:39.539
So these reconstructions are
based on guesses.

00:22:39.539 --> 00:22:41.781
Some of them are excellent,
excellent guesses,

00:22:41.781 --> 00:22:44.371
very well supported by
evidence, but some of them are

00:22:44.371 --> 00:22:46.582
not.
Some of the criteria invoked

00:22:46.582 --> 00:22:49.559
for separating the sources are
truly arbitrary,

00:22:49.559 --> 00:22:51.759
and extraordinarily subjective.
 

00:22:51.759 --> 00:22:55.051
They are sometimes based on all
sorts of unfounded assumption

00:22:55.051 --> 00:22:57.740
about the way texts were
composed in antiquity,

00:22:57.740 --> 00:23:00.286
and the more that we learn
about how texts in antiquity

00:23:00.286 --> 00:23:02.266
were composed,
we realize that it's perhaps

00:23:02.266 --> 00:23:05.142
not unusual for a text to use
two different terms for the same

00:23:05.142 --> 00:23:08.975
thing within one story,
since we find texts in the

00:23:08.975 --> 00:23:14.382
sixteenth, seventeenth century
BCE on one tablet using two

00:23:14.382 --> 00:23:18.650
different terms to connote the
same thing.

00:23:18.650 --> 00:23:22.551
So the criteria that are
invoked for separating sources

00:23:22.551 --> 00:23:26.380
often ignore the literary
conventions of antiquity,

00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:28.990
and the more that we learn
about that the better able we

00:23:28.990 --> 00:23:31.789
are to understand the way the
biblical text was composed.

00:23:31.789 --> 00:23:34.880
Repetition isn't always a sign
of dual sources;

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:37.539
it often servers a rhetorical
function.

00:23:37.539 --> 00:23:40.849
Variant terms aren't always a
sign of dual sources;

00:23:40.849 --> 00:23:43.759
they may have a literary or
aesthetic function.

00:23:43.759 --> 00:23:47.211
So most biblical scholars today
do accept some version of

00:23:47.211 --> 00:23:50.539
Wellhausen's theory--yes,
we feel the Bible is composed

00:23:50.539 --> 00:23:52.079
of different sources.
 

00:23:52.079 --> 00:23:55.070
We don't always have tremendous
confidence, though,

00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:58.599
in some of the finer details
and conclusions of his work and

00:23:58.599 --> 00:24:01.829
the work of other scholars who
followed after him.

00:24:01.829 --> 00:24:05.868
Some doubt the existence of E
altogether--it is so fragmentary

00:24:05.868 --> 00:24:08.780
and so isolated.
Others defend the antiquity of

00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:10.730
P --we'll be coming back to
that.

00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:13.928
Others argue that everything is
post-exilic, everything's after

00:24:13.928 --> 00:24:14.960
the fifth century.
 

00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:17.214
It was written in the fourth,
third century in the Persian

00:24:17.214 --> 00:24:18.927
period.
None of it comes from an older

00:24:18.927 --> 00:24:20.576
period.
Scandinavian scholars,

00:24:20.576 --> 00:24:23.849
they're not enthusiastic about
source criticism at all.

00:24:23.849 --> 00:24:27.147
The whole Copenhagen School of
Bible scholarship prefers--many

00:24:27.147 --> 00:24:30.499
of them prefer--to see the Bible
as basically an oral narrative

00:24:30.499 --> 00:24:33.039
that just grew through accretion
over time.

00:24:33.039 --> 00:24:36.166
So I did assign readings in the
documentary hypothesis--it's

00:24:36.166 --> 00:24:39.345
extraordinarily important--but
you do need to understand that

00:24:39.345 --> 00:24:42.223
it is one hypothesis,
a major and controlling

00:24:42.223 --> 00:24:45.869
hypothesis out there,
but it's not without criticism.

00:24:45.869 --> 00:24:49.534
Moreover, while it's a very
important and worthwhile project

00:24:49.534 --> 00:24:53.136
to analyze the component sources
and examine their specific

00:24:53.136 --> 00:24:57.238
concerns and contribution,
and you'll see that I'm a very

00:24:57.238 --> 00:25:00.596
great fan of P,
we must remember that whatever

00:25:00.596 --> 00:25:04.854
sources were woven together,
they were woven together with

00:25:04.854 --> 00:25:08.609
great skill and care by a final
redactor, or redactors,

00:25:08.609 --> 00:25:12.188
who wanted them to be read as a
unity, and surely that must mean

00:25:12.188 --> 00:25:14.377
something.
It must mean they can be

00:25:14.377 --> 00:25:17.342
read as a unity and that that's
a challenge that's been issued

00:25:17.342 --> 00:25:20.023
to us.
So the Bible can be read both

00:25:20.023 --> 00:25:22.500
analytically and synthetically.
 

00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:26.260
We need to combine an awareness
of origins, not gloss over the

00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:28.849
problems and the contradictions
and say,

00:25:28.849 --> 00:25:31.297
"Well, we can resolve it by
coming up with some strange

00:25:31.297 --> 00:25:33.109
scenario that makes both things
work."

00:25:33.109 --> 00:25:35.775
Be aware that there are
problems, contradictions,

00:25:35.775 --> 00:25:38.941
these derive from different
sources, but also be sensitive

00:25:38.941 --> 00:25:41.440
to the artistry of the final
composition.

00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:44.140
What does it mean that both of
these elements have been

00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:45.590
retained here side by side?
 

00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:50.339
What is the phrase?
 

00:25:50.339 --> 00:25:52.800
The whole is greater than the
sum of the parts.

00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:54.829
So keep that awareness.
 

00:25:54.829 --> 00:25:58.133
And in the last 20 years or so,
source criticism--actually 30

00:25:58.133 --> 00:26:01.492
years or so--source criticism in
the conventional sense of the

00:26:01.492 --> 00:26:04.851
analysis of documentary sources
has been supplemented by other

00:26:04.851 --> 00:26:08.320
new and exciting methodologies
in the study of the Bible,

00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:09.819
and we'll see some of those.
 

00:26:09.819 --> 00:26:12.804
I've also included as optional
reading for you sometimes,

00:26:12.804 --> 00:26:15.630
a couple of articles that
analyze biblical stories.

00:26:15.630 --> 00:26:18.417
They are written by someone who
thinks that documentary

00:26:18.417 --> 00:26:21.359
hypothesis just doesn't really
help us out much at all,

00:26:21.359 --> 00:26:24.294
and she gives some wonderful,
coherent readings of stories

00:26:24.294 --> 00:26:27.383
that argue this scene here or
this contradiction here isn't a

00:26:27.383 --> 00:26:30.008
sign of a different source;
it serves this literary

00:26:30.008 --> 00:26:31.440
purpose, that literary purpose.
 

00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:34.901
And I put those in subversively
for you to have a look at in

00:26:34.901 --> 00:26:37.828
your own time.
They're brilliantly written and

00:26:37.828 --> 00:26:41.549
they give you insight into the
various ways in which we can

00:26:41.549 --> 00:26:44.174
read the text.
But many of the alternative

00:26:44.174 --> 00:26:47.299
methodologies for studying the
text do assume sources,

00:26:47.299 --> 00:26:50.654
in some broad sense even if not
all the details of Wellhausen's

00:26:50.654 --> 00:26:53.359
theory, so it's clear that a
great deal of biblical

00:26:53.359 --> 00:26:56.172
scholarship owes its
accomplishments and its theories

00:26:56.172 --> 00:26:59.634
to the work that was done by the
source critics of the nineteenth

00:26:59.634 --> 00:27:02.593
century.
I want to flip back to text for

00:27:02.593 --> 00:27:06.849
a moment before I return to talk
about a whole contradictory set

00:27:06.849 --> 00:27:09.976
of methodologies,
or methodologies that pull in

00:27:09.976 --> 00:27:11.140
another direction.
 

00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:13.807
But first I want to get us up
to the patriarchs and matriarchs

00:27:13.807 --> 00:27:15.950
where we're going to be starting
off on Monday.

00:27:15.950 --> 00:27:20.645
We have just had a flood,
and then we move into Genesis

00:27:20.645 --> 00:27:22.794
10;
and Genesis 10 contains a

00:27:22.794 --> 00:27:24.920
genealogical table of nations.
 

00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:28.279
In this table,
peoples of various lands are

00:27:28.279 --> 00:27:32.519
portrayed as having descended
from a common source,

00:27:32.519 --> 00:27:36.035
a common ancestor,
Noah, through his three sons,

00:27:36.035 --> 00:27:37.830
Japheth, Ham and Shem.
 

00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:40.730
Shem: Shemites, Semites.
 

00:27:40.730 --> 00:27:44.543
Shemites are said to descend
from Noah's son,

00:27:44.543 --> 00:27:47.524
Shem.
The biblical text at this point

00:27:47.524 --> 00:27:52.045
is understanding humanity as
basically sharing a common root

00:27:52.045 --> 00:27:54.420
united by a common language.
 

00:27:54.420 --> 00:27:58.800
The story that follows in
Genesis 11 can be understood

00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:02.544
then as an etiological tale,
a tale that comes to explain

00:28:02.544 --> 00:28:04.711
something, and this tale is
coming to explain the

00:28:04.711 --> 00:28:07.374
diversification of language:
when we look around we see that

00:28:07.374 --> 00:28:09.993
in fact people don't seem to be
that united and are in fact

00:28:09.993 --> 00:28:11.980
divided by their languages and
so on.

00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:15.179
So how are we to account for
the diversification of

00:28:15.179 --> 00:28:18.442
languages, the spread of
different ethnic linguistic

00:28:18.442 --> 00:28:22.218
groups throughout the lands of
the earth if we all come from

00:28:22.218 --> 00:28:26.220
one common creative moment,
one common ancestor?

00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:28.470
Genesis 11 explains that.
 

00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:32.817
The story is therefore going to
act as a bridge between the

00:28:32.817 --> 00:28:36.940
first section of Genesis which
has a universal scale,

00:28:36.940 --> 00:28:39.872
a universal scope,
and what happens in Genesis

00:28:39.872 --> 00:28:43.326
beginning in Chapter 12,
where we're going to focus in

00:28:43.326 --> 00:28:46.950
on one ethnic,
linguistic group and one land.

00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:49.952
This story serves as the
bridge, first of all explaining

00:28:49.952 --> 00:28:53.391
how it is that a united humanity
speaking a common language even

00:28:53.391 --> 00:28:56.339
becomes diversified
linguistically and ethnically,

00:28:56.339 --> 00:28:59.080
to then focus in on one group
and one land.

00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:02.759
 
 

00:29:02.759 --> 00:29:06.685
Babel, pronounced
"bavel" in Hebrew,

00:29:06.685 --> 00:29:10.414
is Babylon.
The tower in the story of the

00:29:10.414 --> 00:29:15.875
Tower of Babel is identified by
scholars as a very famous tower,

00:29:15.875 --> 00:29:19.950
a ziggurat, a ziggurat to
Marduk in Babylon.

00:29:19.950 --> 00:29:24.179
The Bible's hostility to
Babylon--after all it's going to

00:29:24.179 --> 00:29:28.937
be the Babylonians who are going
to destroy them in 586--but the

00:29:28.937 --> 00:29:33.620
Bible's hostility to Babylon and
its imperialism is clear.

00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:36.849
This story has a satirical tone.
 

00:29:36.849 --> 00:29:39.054
The word Babel,
Bavel,

00:29:39.054 --> 00:29:42.676
means Gate of the God,
but it's the basis for a

00:29:42.676 --> 00:29:46.927
wonderful pun in Hebrew,
which also actually happens to

00:29:46.927 --> 00:29:51.262
work in English.
Babble nonsensical speaking,

00:29:51.262 --> 00:29:53.400
confusion of language.
 

00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:57.212
And I think there's obviously
some onomatopoeic quality to

00:29:57.212 --> 00:30:00.957
"Babel" that makes it have that
kind of a meaning both in

00:30:00.957 --> 00:30:03.700
English and a similar word in
Hebrew.

00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:08.504
So this word can also with a
little bit of punning mean

00:30:08.504 --> 00:30:11.529
confusion, or confused language.
 

00:30:11.529 --> 00:30:15.036
So this mighty tower that was
obviously the pride of Babylon

00:30:15.036 --> 00:30:18.008
in the ancient world is
represented by the biblical

00:30:18.008 --> 00:30:22.050
storywriter as the occasion for
the confusion of human language.

00:30:22.050 --> 00:30:25.059
 
 

00:30:25.059 --> 00:30:28.573
The construction of Marduk's
ziggurat is represented as

00:30:28.573 --> 00:30:29.940
displeasing to God.
 

00:30:29.940 --> 00:30:32.590
Why?
There are very many possible

00:30:32.590 --> 00:30:36.029
interpretations and our
commentaries are full of them.

00:30:36.029 --> 00:30:40.061
Some interpreters view the
tower builders as seeking to

00:30:40.061 --> 00:30:44.392
elevate themselves to storm
heaven by building a tower with

00:30:44.392 --> 00:30:46.109
its top in the sky.
 

00:30:46.109 --> 00:30:49.990
Others see the builders as
defying God's direct order.

00:30:49.990 --> 00:30:52.479
Remember, God said,
"Be fruitful and multiply and

00:30:52.479 --> 00:30:55.019
fill the earth," spread out and
fill the earth.

00:30:55.019 --> 00:30:57.546
But these people are said to
come together,

00:30:57.546 --> 00:31:00.975
they congregate in one place,
and instead of spreading out

00:31:00.975 --> 00:31:02.900
they're trying to rise high.
 

00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:06.356
There seems to be a real
defiance of God's design for

00:31:06.356 --> 00:31:09.348
humanity, and so God frustrates
their plan for

00:31:09.348 --> 00:31:12.695
self-monumentalizing,
and he scatters them over the

00:31:12.695 --> 00:31:13.799
face of the earth.
 

00:31:13.799 --> 00:31:17.411
He makes it more difficult for
them to do this again by

00:31:17.411 --> 00:31:19.150
confusing their tongues.
 

00:31:19.150 --> 00:31:21.859
Once again there's a very steep
learning curve for this God.

00:31:21.859 --> 00:31:25.377
He has to keep adjusting things
depending on what it is that

00:31:25.377 --> 00:31:26.509
humans are doing.
 

00:31:26.509 --> 00:31:29.150
So now he's got to confuse
their languages.

00:31:29.150 --> 00:31:32.470
Some interpreters see this
story as representing a

00:31:32.470 --> 00:31:36.740
rejection of civilization or
certain aspects of civilization.

00:31:36.740 --> 00:31:39.042
Monumental architecture,
empire building,

00:31:39.042 --> 00:31:42.381
these are always things that
are looked upon with suspicion

00:31:42.381 --> 00:31:45.720
for most of the biblical sources
and biblical writers.

00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:48.289
Those sorts of ambitions are
viewed negatively.

00:31:48.289 --> 00:31:51.119
They lead to human
self-aggrandizement.

00:31:51.119 --> 00:31:53.468
They are indicative of an
arrogant sort of

00:31:53.468 --> 00:31:57.133
self-reliance--that the prophets
will certainly rail against--and

00:31:57.133 --> 00:31:59.309
in some sense a forgetting of
God.

00:31:59.309 --> 00:32:02.776
So this is a time in which
humans spread out,

00:32:02.776 --> 00:32:06.478
lose their unity,
and this is also a time really

00:32:06.478 --> 00:32:10.259
when they turn to the worship of
other gods.

00:32:10.259 --> 00:32:14.822
The first 11 chapters of
Genesis then have given us a

00:32:14.822 --> 00:32:19.559
cosmic, universal setting for
the history of Israel.

00:32:19.559 --> 00:32:23.767
Those first chapters cover 2500
years if you go through and add

00:32:23.767 --> 00:32:25.259
up the chronologies.
 

00:32:25.259 --> 00:32:28.315
The rest of Genesis,
Genesis 12 through 50,

00:32:28.315 --> 00:32:32.025
will cover just four
generations: the generations of

00:32:32.025 --> 00:32:34.790
the patriarchs and the
matriarchs.

00:32:34.790 --> 00:32:38.846
They will be Abraham and Sarah;
their son Isaac,

00:32:38.846 --> 00:32:41.742
his wife Rebekah;
their son Jacob,

00:32:41.742 --> 00:32:46.710
his two wives Rachel and Leah,
I am leaving out other wives;

00:32:46.710 --> 00:32:50.759
but finally their children,
12 sons and one daughter.

00:32:50.759 --> 00:32:53.292
So God's focus has shifted
dramatically,

00:32:53.292 --> 00:32:56.150
the text's focus has shifted
dramatically.

00:32:56.150 --> 00:33:00.496
Why?
When you get to the end of

00:33:00.496 --> 00:33:05.840
Genesis 11 you feel that God has
been rather shut out.

00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:07.890
Things aren't going well.
 

00:33:07.890 --> 00:33:11.063
Although God created the earth
as an intrinsically good

00:33:11.063 --> 00:33:13.589
paradise, he created humans in
his image,

00:33:13.589 --> 00:33:17.360
he provided for them,
humans to this point have put

00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:20.829
their moral freedom pretty much
to poor use.

00:33:20.829 --> 00:33:23.332
Many scholars,
Kaufman, Sarna and others,

00:33:23.332 --> 00:33:26.961
say that one of the differences
then between these myths of

00:33:26.961 --> 00:33:30.403
Israel and the mythologies of
their neighbors is that in

00:33:30.403 --> 00:33:34.220
Ancient Near Eastern mythologies
you have the struggle of good

00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:36.160
and evil cosmic powers.
 

00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:39.993
In the myths of the Bible this
is replaced by a struggle

00:33:39.993 --> 00:33:43.339
between the will of God and
rebellious humans.

00:33:43.339 --> 00:33:45.636
So these myths are telling also
of a struggle,

00:33:45.636 --> 00:33:47.269
but it's on a different plane.
 

00:33:47.269 --> 00:33:50.301
Adam and Eve,
Cain, the generation of the

00:33:50.301 --> 00:33:54.395
flood, the builders of the tower
of Babel--God has been

00:33:54.395 --> 00:33:58.640
continually spurned or thwarted
by these characters.

00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:02.175
So he's withdrawing his focus,
and is going to choose to

00:34:02.175 --> 00:34:04.490
reveal himself to one small
group,

00:34:04.490 --> 00:34:06.411
as if to say,
"Okay, I can't reach everybody,

00:34:06.411 --> 00:34:08.289
let me see if I can just find
one person,

00:34:08.289 --> 00:34:10.949
one party, and start from there
and build out."

00:34:10.949 --> 00:34:14.065
And so in Genesis 12 which
begins the second stage of the

00:34:14.065 --> 00:34:18.106
Bible's historical narrative,
we read that God calls to Abram

00:34:18.106 --> 00:34:22.739
to leave the land of his fathers
and travel to a land which God

00:34:22.739 --> 00:34:25.543
will show him,
beginning a whole new stage of

00:34:25.543 --> 00:34:28.251
the biblical narrative,
and we'll sense that there's a

00:34:28.251 --> 00:34:30.960
very different feeling when you
get to Genesis 12.

00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:33.739
When you read that material,
it will feel different to you.

00:34:33.739 --> 00:34:37.894
And because of that we need to
talk a little bit more about

00:34:37.894 --> 00:34:42.550
ways to read the biblical text,
methods of criticism and so on.

00:34:42.550 --> 00:34:47.078
In preparation for looking at
the biblical narrative material

00:34:47.078 --> 00:34:50.550
that deals specifically with the
Israelites,

00:34:50.550 --> 00:34:52.673
we need to think of some,
or learn about some,

00:34:52.673 --> 00:34:55.080
of the other critical
methodologies that are used in

00:34:55.080 --> 00:34:57.703
biblical scholarship,
and for a moment we're going to

00:34:57.703 --> 00:34:59.239
the adopt the role of historian.
 

00:34:59.239 --> 00:35:02.424
I'm going to ask you to think
like historians--whatever that

00:35:02.424 --> 00:35:05.446
might mean--now and as we move
into next week and look at

00:35:05.446 --> 00:35:06.849
Genesis 12 through 50.
 

00:35:06.849 --> 00:35:10.829
The source critical method that
we talked about today focuses on

00:35:10.829 --> 00:35:14.429
the hypothetical period of the
compilation of the text,

00:35:14.429 --> 00:35:18.260
the compilation of the four
sources into the Torah.

00:35:18.260 --> 00:35:22.077
But later scholars began to
ask, "Well, what about the

00:35:22.077 --> 00:35:24.310
pre-history of those sources?
 

00:35:24.310 --> 00:35:27.770
What were the sources' sources?"
 

00:35:27.770 --> 00:35:30.650
Why should that be important?
 

00:35:30.650 --> 00:35:34.211
Remember that the source
critics claimed and concluded

00:35:34.211 --> 00:35:38.109
that J, E, P and D were written
from the tenth to the sixth

00:35:38.109 --> 00:35:40.021
centuries,
and the implication,

00:35:40.021 --> 00:35:42.400
well actually not just the
implication, the strong

00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:45.314
assertion of many of them was
that despite the fact that they

00:35:45.314 --> 00:35:47.500
purport to tell of events prior
to 1000,

00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:50.860
in fact they're just not at all
reliable for those periods.

00:35:50.860 --> 00:35:53.017
They were written centuries
after the fact,

00:35:53.017 --> 00:35:55.329
we really can't know anything
about Israel,

00:35:55.329 --> 00:35:57.005
Israel's religion,
Israel's history,

00:35:57.005 --> 00:35:59.159
religious history before the
tenth century.

00:35:59.159 --> 00:36:02.325
That was a very dissatisfying
conclusion to many people,

00:36:02.325 --> 00:36:05.612
because the writers of J,
E, P and D probably didn't sit

00:36:05.612 --> 00:36:08.903
down at typewriters and just
invent their documents out of

00:36:08.903 --> 00:36:11.940
whole cloth.
It doesn't seem that that's the

00:36:11.940 --> 00:36:15.159
way these materials would have
been composed.

00:36:15.159 --> 00:36:19.154
They didn't invent,
probably, all of these cultic

00:36:19.154 --> 00:36:22.900
rules and ritual practices all
of a sudden.

00:36:22.900 --> 00:36:26.359
It seems likely that they were
drawing on older traditions

00:36:26.359 --> 00:36:28.787
themselves: older stories,
older customs,

00:36:28.787 --> 00:36:30.789
older laws, ritual practices.
 

00:36:30.789 --> 00:36:33.955
Scholars in the next wave of
biblical scholarship began to

00:36:33.955 --> 00:36:35.900
ask a different set of
questions;

00:36:35.900 --> 00:36:39.947
they became interested in
asking: what materials did the

00:36:39.947 --> 00:36:43.921
compiler or the compilers of J
or E or P draw on in the

00:36:43.921 --> 00:36:46.349
composition of those sources?
 

00:36:46.349 --> 00:36:49.619
Did they use more ancient
materials, and if so can we

00:36:49.619 --> 00:36:51.380
figure out what they were?
 

00:36:51.380 --> 00:36:55.239
Do they contain reliable
traditions for an earlier stage?

00:36:55.239 --> 00:36:59.135
And if so, then maybe we do
have access after all to

00:36:59.135 --> 00:37:04.099
information regarding Israelite
history prior to the year 1000.

00:37:04.099 --> 00:37:07.271
Suddenly you see an analytical
approach to the Bible that's

00:37:07.271 --> 00:37:10.169
going to pull in the exact
opposite direction from the

00:37:10.169 --> 00:37:11.699
classical source theory.
 

00:37:11.699 --> 00:37:14.641
One of the leading scholars to
take up this question was

00:37:14.641 --> 00:37:16.995
Hermann Gunkel,
whose name is at the top over

00:37:16.995 --> 00:37:19.058
there.
Gunkel had a great knowledge of

00:37:19.058 --> 00:37:21.719
the oral literature of other
cultures, other nations,

00:37:21.719 --> 00:37:24.789
and that led him to ask:
Can we perhaps analyze these

00:37:24.789 --> 00:37:28.390
four literary source documents
and figure out the pre-literary

00:37:28.390 --> 00:37:30.280
stages of their development?
 

00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:33.570
What went into their
compilation and composition?

00:37:33.570 --> 00:37:37.665
He found support for this idea
within the Bible itself because

00:37:37.665 --> 00:37:41.223
at times the Bible seems to name
earlier sources quite

00:37:41.223 --> 00:37:43.798
explicitly.
We don't have records of those

00:37:43.798 --> 00:37:46.100
sources anymore,
but they seem to be named in

00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:48.929
the Bible.
In Numbers 21:14 there's a

00:37:48.929 --> 00:37:54.137
little poetic excerpt that gives
the boundaries between Moab and

00:37:54.137 --> 00:37:57.266
the Amorites,
and it's quoted and it says

00:37:57.266 --> 00:38:00.210
it's from the Book of the Wars
of the Lord.

00:38:00.210 --> 00:38:02.873
It's quoted as if this is a
source that the person is

00:38:02.873 --> 00:38:05.639
drawing on and using in the
composition of his text,

00:38:05.639 --> 00:38:08.488
and it's quoted in a way that
makes it sound as if the source

00:38:08.488 --> 00:38:10.150
should be familiar to the
reader.

00:38:10.150 --> 00:38:13.024
We also have mention of
something called the Book of

00:38:13.024 --> 00:38:15.052
Yashar in Joshua,
that's also quoted,

00:38:15.052 --> 00:38:17.712
in Joshua 10:13.
Or in 2 Samuel 1:18,

00:38:17.712 --> 00:38:21.695
we have David lamenting,
a very beautiful lament over

00:38:21.695 --> 00:38:25.219
the death of Saul and his
beloved Jonathan.

00:38:25.219 --> 00:38:29.012
It seems to actually be an epic
song that recounts acts of

00:38:29.012 --> 00:38:31.996
Israel's heroes.
He's reciting that now as he

00:38:31.996 --> 00:38:35.823
laments over the death of these
two, and so it seems to be an

00:38:35.823 --> 00:38:39.714
earlier source that's been put
into the story of David and his

00:38:39.714 --> 00:38:41.979
lament.
So it seems reasonable in light

00:38:41.979 --> 00:38:44.638
of the practices of other
people, other ancient cultures

00:38:44.638 --> 00:38:47.539
and literatures as well as some
contemporary literatures,

00:38:47.539 --> 00:38:51.059
and it seems reasonable in
light of the explicit citation

00:38:51.059 --> 00:38:55.018
of sources in the biblical text
to suppose that in fact the four

00:38:55.018 --> 00:38:58.914
primary documents are themselves
compilations from other source

00:38:58.914 --> 00:39:01.668
materials,
or drawing on written or oral

00:39:01.668 --> 00:39:04.019
materials from an even earlier
period.

00:39:04.019 --> 00:39:07.420
Gunkel began to focus on small
little units.

00:39:07.420 --> 00:39:11.123
He was interested in small
units within the four primary

00:39:11.123 --> 00:39:14.086
documents, and he identified
genres or forms,

00:39:14.086 --> 00:39:15.769
what he called forms.
 

00:39:15.769 --> 00:39:17.789
The German word is a
Gattung,

00:39:17.789 --> 00:39:19.289
Gattungen,
forms.

00:39:19.289 --> 00:39:22.844
He would identify these small
units, and that gave rise to the

00:39:22.844 --> 00:39:25.699
name of this approach,
which is form criticism.

00:39:25.699 --> 00:39:29.143
He believed that what he was
doing was identifying older,

00:39:29.143 --> 00:39:32.648
pre-literary forms that had
been taken up and incorporated

00:39:32.648 --> 00:39:36.510
by the literary sources,
by J, E, P and D.

00:39:36.510 --> 00:39:39.800
Examples of the kind of form,
or Gattung,

00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:43.159
that he would identify are
things like a hymn,

00:39:43.159 --> 00:39:46.729
a proverb--we often have
biblical texts quoting proverbs

00:39:46.729 --> 00:39:49.130
that seem to be folk
sayings--laws,

00:39:49.130 --> 00:39:53.026
rituals, folk stories of a
particular type,

00:39:53.026 --> 00:39:57.480
poems, legends,
songs, fragments of mythology.

00:39:57.480 --> 00:40:00.628
So for example he says of
Genesis 6:1-4,

00:40:00.628 --> 00:40:04.136
a passage that you've read:
When men began to

00:40:04.136 --> 00:40:06.449
increase on earth and daughters
were born to them,

00:40:06.449 --> 00:40:09.046
the divine beings saw how
beautiful the daughters of men

00:40:09.046 --> 00:40:11.880
were and took wives from among
those that pleased them.

00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:14.169
The Lord said,
"My breath shall not abide in

00:40:14.169 --> 00:40:16.139
man forever, since he too is
flesh;

00:40:16.139 --> 00:40:19.150
let the days allowed him be one
hundred and twenty years."

00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:20.557
It was then,
and later too,

00:40:20.557 --> 00:40:22.940
that the Nephilim [these giants
of some kind]

00:40:22.940 --> 00:40:26.134
appeared on earth--when the
divine beings cohabited with the

00:40:26.134 --> 00:40:28.989
daughters of men,
who bore them offspring [these

00:40:28.989 --> 00:40:30.329
giants, these Nephilim].
 

00:40:30.329 --> 00:40:33.400
They were the heroes of old,
the men of renown.

00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:36.269
That's just stuck in there,
in Genesis 6:1-4.

00:40:36.269 --> 00:40:40.491
This is an older fragment of a
mythology or a legend which is

00:40:40.491 --> 00:40:42.039
put into place here.
 

00:40:42.039 --> 00:40:46.943
It's explaining the origin of
heroes and great men of renown

00:40:46.943 --> 00:40:49.598
in the old days.
He also says that there are

00:40:49.598 --> 00:40:50.500
etiological stories.
 

00:40:50.500 --> 00:40:52.828
We've talked about
those--legends that give the

00:40:52.828 --> 00:40:54.296
origin of a name,
or a ritual,

00:40:54.296 --> 00:40:55.409
or an institution.
 

00:40:55.409 --> 00:40:58.380
There are different types of
etiological stories.

00:40:58.380 --> 00:41:01.404
He says there are ethnological
legends that will give you the

00:41:01.404 --> 00:41:04.126
story accounting for the origin
of a particular people:

00:41:04.126 --> 00:41:07.001
so the Moabites for example,
and the Ammonites--not a

00:41:07.001 --> 00:41:09.683
flattering story at all
following the destruction of

00:41:09.683 --> 00:41:10.840
Sodom and Gomorrah.
 

00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:13.667
Obviously the Israelites didn't
care for those people very much

00:41:13.667 --> 00:41:15.400
and gave them a pretty nasty
origin.

00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:19.156
We also have etymological
legends, because they're

00:41:19.156 --> 00:41:21.840
explaining the name of
something.

00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:25.416
It's given this particular name
because of an etymomological

00:41:25.416 --> 00:41:27.659
connection with some event
earlier.

00:41:27.659 --> 00:41:30.514
So all of these things,
he argues, are probably older

00:41:30.514 --> 00:41:33.862
existing traditions that have
been taken up and adapted by the

00:41:33.862 --> 00:41:36.907
biblical writer,
and they may preserve some

00:41:36.907 --> 00:41:38.780
historical reminiscence.
 

00:41:38.780 --> 00:41:42.230
More importantly,
more important then the actual

00:41:42.230 --> 00:41:46.048
events that they might be
reporting, is the fact that

00:41:46.048 --> 00:41:49.719
behind each of these is some
sort of function.

00:41:49.719 --> 00:41:52.578
Each one of these did some sort
of cultural work,

00:41:52.578 --> 00:41:55.079
it had some function or setting
in life.

00:41:55.079 --> 00:41:58.288
That's what we can discover
when we isolate these forms:

00:41:58.288 --> 00:41:59.630
this setting in life.
 

00:41:59.630 --> 00:42:03.335
That helps us learn something
about ancient Israelite society

00:42:03.335 --> 00:42:05.930
or culture way before the tenth
century.

00:42:05.930 --> 00:42:07.500
That's Gunkel's claim.
 

00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:11.419
So form criticism wasn't
content with just identifying

00:42:11.419 --> 00:42:15.559
these various types of material,
these various genres;

00:42:15.559 --> 00:42:18.250
it asked what was their
function?

00:42:18.250 --> 00:42:20.000
What was their Sitz im
Leben?

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:23.949
What was their situation in
life, their cultural context?

00:42:23.949 --> 00:42:26.493
What does it tell us that we
have a large number of

00:42:26.493 --> 00:42:27.460
liturgical texts?
 

00:42:27.460 --> 00:42:30.036
What does it tell us that we
have a large number of texts

00:42:30.036 --> 00:42:32.519
that seem to point to some sort
of judicial context?

00:42:32.519 --> 00:42:35.261
What does it tell us that we
have a great deal of proverbs,

00:42:35.261 --> 00:42:38.143
or wisdom material in certain
parts of the Bible that we might

00:42:38.143 --> 00:42:39.420
date to a certain time?
 

00:42:39.420 --> 00:42:42.587
What does this tell us about
society and what people were

00:42:42.587 --> 00:42:45.491
doing?
Growing out of form criticism

00:42:45.491 --> 00:42:47.519
is tradition criticism.
 

00:42:47.519 --> 00:42:52.311
This is a type of criticism
that focuses on the transmission

00:42:52.311 --> 00:42:56.289
of traditional material through
various stages,

00:42:56.289 --> 00:43:00.074
oral stages and literary
stages, until it reaches its

00:43:00.074 --> 00:43:02.039
present form in the text.
 

00:43:02.039 --> 00:43:06.303
Now you can imagine as a story
is told and then it's retold,

00:43:06.303 --> 00:43:09.050
it is obviously changed and
adapted.

00:43:09.050 --> 00:43:11.230
Tradition criticism looks at
that.

00:43:11.230 --> 00:43:14.239
Looking at Ancient Near Eastern
parallels is very helpful.

00:43:14.239 --> 00:43:17.163
You can see how some of those
motifs and themes were changed

00:43:17.163 --> 00:43:19.690
in the process of being
transmitted within Israelite

00:43:19.690 --> 00:43:22.808
culture and society,
and again, to serve some sort

00:43:22.808 --> 00:43:25.070
of cultural function,
or purpose.

00:43:25.070 --> 00:43:28.385
So the present text of the
Pentateuch obviously rests on a

00:43:28.385 --> 00:43:30.769
very, very long period of
transmission,

00:43:30.769 --> 00:43:33.303
both oral recitation and
transmission,

00:43:33.303 --> 00:43:37.000
very much like the Greek
classics, Homer's classics,

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:38.691
the Odyssey,
the Iliad:

00:43:38.691 --> 00:43:41.041
they also had a long history of
oral recitation and

00:43:41.041 --> 00:43:43.974
transmission,
and were transformed along the

00:43:43.974 --> 00:43:45.850
way.
Tradition criticism likes to

00:43:45.850 --> 00:43:48.730
look at the way people receive
traditional material,

00:43:48.730 --> 00:43:52.352
rework it in creative ways and
then adapt it to their own

00:43:52.352 --> 00:43:54.940
purposes and contexts and
transmit it.

00:43:54.940 --> 00:43:59.420
Sometimes that process is
reflected in the Bible itself.

00:43:59.420 --> 00:44:02.547
Traditions in one part of the
Bible will be picked up in a

00:44:02.547 --> 00:44:05.509
later part of the Bible,
and written rather differently

00:44:05.509 --> 00:44:07.429
with a different point of view.
 

00:44:07.429 --> 00:44:09.050
So Deuteronomy,
for example,

00:44:09.050 --> 00:44:12.170
recounts events that we've also
read about in Exodus,

00:44:12.170 --> 00:44:15.050
and sometimes the differences
are startling.

00:44:15.050 --> 00:44:18.927
Sometimes there are completely
new emphases and the story can

00:44:18.927 --> 00:44:21.900
come out to be a very,
very different story.

00:44:21.900 --> 00:44:25.264
1 and 2 Chronicles are a
retelling and a reworking of

00:44:25.264 --> 00:44:28.630
much of the material from
Genesis through 2 Kings,

00:44:28.630 --> 00:44:32.570
and it cleans up a lot of the
embarrassing moments.

00:44:32.570 --> 00:44:37.110
It presses its own themes in
retelling those stories.

00:44:37.110 --> 00:44:40.280
Early laws are subject to
reinterpretation.

00:44:40.280 --> 00:44:43.281
Ezekiel comes along and does
some interesting things with

00:44:43.281 --> 00:44:46.230
some of the legal material that
we find in Leviticus.

00:44:46.230 --> 00:44:49.216
This is all the kind of thing
that tradition criticism looks

00:44:49.216 --> 00:44:51.236
at.
Tradition criticism wants to

00:44:51.236 --> 00:44:54.516
uncover the changes that occur
in the transmission of

00:44:54.516 --> 00:44:56.030
traditional material.
 

00:44:56.030 --> 00:44:58.640
It's already happening--we can
see it--within the Bible,

00:44:58.640 --> 00:45:01.346
and the assumption therefore is
that it happens before the

00:45:01.346 --> 00:45:03.150
material even gets into the
Bible.

00:45:03.150 --> 00:45:06.215
Perhaps we can figure some of
that out, and it's a process

00:45:06.215 --> 00:45:08.690
that also aids in historical
reconstruction.

00:45:08.690 --> 00:45:11.379
So you can see after classic
source criticism,

00:45:11.379 --> 00:45:14.786
which came along and leveled
people's interest in anything

00:45:14.786 --> 00:45:17.855
before the tenth century,
and said: all we have are these

00:45:17.855 --> 00:45:20.439
written accounts that reflect
the biases of the people at the

00:45:20.439 --> 00:45:23.571
time who wrote them,
you then have the rise of types

00:45:23.571 --> 00:45:27.440
of scholarship that say:
we're not satisfied with that.

00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:29.440
That's not really how
literature works.

00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:32.000
People don't sit down and
invent things out of whole

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:34.210
cloth, particularly material of
this type.

00:45:34.210 --> 00:45:36.784
It clearly has a history,
they're clearly drawing on

00:45:36.784 --> 00:45:39.712
sources and maybe we can use
analytical tools to figure out

00:45:39.712 --> 00:45:42.893
something about the period that
you might think would be lost to

00:45:42.893 --> 00:45:45.706
history.
So these types of criticism are

00:45:45.706 --> 00:45:49.104
emphasizing the real life
historical setting of the

00:45:49.104 --> 00:45:52.230
materials that are in the
biblical sources,

00:45:52.230 --> 00:45:55.764
their relationship to the wider
culture, and that's something

00:45:55.764 --> 00:45:59.239
that earlier source criticism
didn't care too much about.

00:45:59.239 --> 00:46:02.323
All of these analytical modes
of studying the Bible--by

00:46:02.323 --> 00:46:05.750
analytical I mean sitting down
and analyzing the features,

00:46:05.750 --> 00:46:09.177
the literary features of the
text, and drawing conclusions

00:46:09.177 --> 00:46:12.786
from them--all of these modes of
examining the Bible--most of

00:46:12.786 --> 00:46:16.153
them developed by German
scholars--can be contrasted with

00:46:16.153 --> 00:46:19.942
the North American tradition of
scholarship which emphasized the

00:46:19.942 --> 00:46:23.310
correlation of biblical and
archaeological data.

00:46:23.310 --> 00:46:25.557
I've written the name Albright;
William F.

00:46:25.557 --> 00:46:28.846
Albright, was a leading scholar
at the American school of

00:46:28.846 --> 00:46:31.429
biblical studies,
and he was an expert in the

00:46:31.429 --> 00:46:34.659
fields of Palestinian
archaeology and Assyriology.

00:46:34.659 --> 00:46:37.748
He focused on illustrating the
Bible with the Ancient Near

00:46:37.748 --> 00:46:40.619
Eastern sources that at that
time were newly coming to

00:46:40.619 --> 00:46:44.212
light-- archaeological findings;
and his argument was--and it's

00:46:44.212 --> 00:46:47.277
an argument that's to a large
degree not accepted anymore

00:46:47.277 --> 00:46:50.507
but--his argument at the time
was that archaeology supported

00:46:50.507 --> 00:46:53.190
the basic historicity of
biblical tradition.

00:46:53.190 --> 00:46:56.246
There are some definite
problems, however,

00:46:56.246 --> 00:46:58.929
with viewing the Bible as
history.

00:46:58.929 --> 00:47:00.867
There are certainly problems
with chronology:

00:47:00.867 --> 00:47:03.070
it's hard to pin down dates for
a lot of things.

00:47:03.070 --> 00:47:05.550
Many of the events are given
more then one date.

00:47:05.550 --> 00:47:08.333
A lot of the numbers...the
Bible tends to use ideal

00:47:08.333 --> 00:47:10.467
numbers;
it tends to use fives and

00:47:10.467 --> 00:47:13.181
multiples of five,
or multiples of five plus

00:47:13.181 --> 00:47:15.422
seven.
You have ten generations from

00:47:15.422 --> 00:47:17.640
Adam to Noah.
You have ten generations from

00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:19.962
Noah to Abram.
These things begin to raise

00:47:19.962 --> 00:47:22.289
suspicions.
We have suspicious repetitions

00:47:22.289 --> 00:47:25.095
of events, things that happened
to two or more of the

00:47:25.095 --> 00:47:28.441
patriarchs: twice Abraham goes
into foreign territory and tries

00:47:28.441 --> 00:47:30.600
to pass his wife off as his
sister.

00:47:30.600 --> 00:47:32.340
Isaac does the same thing.
 

00:47:32.340 --> 00:47:35.511
Are these three versions of one
basic tradition that got

00:47:35.511 --> 00:47:37.530
assigned to different
patriarchs?

00:47:37.530 --> 00:47:40.625
Are we supposed to think of
these as representing three

00:47:40.625 --> 00:47:42.460
separate historical incidents?
 

00:47:42.460 --> 00:47:44.740
What's the likelihood of these
things happening?

00:47:44.740 --> 00:47:46.239
Is that historically reasonable?
 

00:47:46.239 --> 00:47:51.048
So there are lots of reasons to
feel that biblical chronologies

00:47:51.048 --> 00:47:55.780
of the patriarchal period are
not accurate historical records:

00:47:55.780 --> 00:47:58.960
I use that phrase with some
timidity.

00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:02.114
But in the twentieth century
scholars of Albright's school

00:48:02.114 --> 00:48:04.771
argued that many of the
traditions in the book of

00:48:04.771 --> 00:48:07.871
Genesis contained authentic
reflections of the historical

00:48:07.871 --> 00:48:10.030
period they claimed to deal
with.

00:48:10.030 --> 00:48:11.940
And they cited a number of
considerations.

00:48:11.940 --> 00:48:15.518
We'll take those up on Monday,
but I would like you--as you

00:48:15.518 --> 00:48:19.282
read Genesis 12 and forward and
think about that material--I'd

00:48:19.282 --> 00:48:22.800
like you to ask yourself:
Is this historical writing?

00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:25.710
By what criteria do I judge
historical writing?

00:48:25.710 --> 00:48:27.820
What do I think historical
writing is?

00:48:27.820 --> 00:48:29.909
What makes some writing
historical?

00:48:29.909 --> 00:48:31.559
What makes other writing
fictional?

00:48:31.559 --> 00:48:33.190
Where do we get these genres
from?

00:48:33.190 --> 00:48:36.030
Why is so important to us to
figure out what this is?

00:48:36.030 --> 00:48:39.877
Think about some of those
issues, and we'll talk a little

00:48:39.877 --> 00:48:44.000
bit more about that as we turn
to the texts in Genesis 12.

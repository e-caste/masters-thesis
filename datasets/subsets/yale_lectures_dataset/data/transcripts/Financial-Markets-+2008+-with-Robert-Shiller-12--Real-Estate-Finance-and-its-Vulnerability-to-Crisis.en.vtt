00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:04.018
Professor Robert
Shiller: I want to start out

00:00:04.018 --> 00:00:06.170
by talking about real estate as
an asset class.

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:10.360
It's actually the biggest and
most important asset class.

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:15.463
The value of real estate in the
United States today is--of real

00:00:15.463 --> 00:00:19.661
estate owned by households
directly--is about twenty

00:00:19.661 --> 00:00:24.473
trillion dollars,
which makes it comparable or

00:00:24.473 --> 00:00:29.870
maybe a little bit bigger than
the stock market.

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:35.994
Stocks owned directly by
households are only about six

00:00:35.994 --> 00:00:39.958
trillion dollars.
For a typical household,

00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:44.750
the home is the major source of
wealth that they've accumulated.

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.003
Of course, other stocks are
held by institutions on their

00:00:49.003 --> 00:00:53.485
behalf, but in terms of direct
ownership, homes are the main

00:00:53.485 --> 00:00:58.316
thing that people own.
There's also commercial real

00:00:58.316 --> 00:01:03.619
estate, which is smaller than
owner-occupied homes,

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:05.958
but we own that indirectly too,
as a people,

00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:09.276
through the stocks that we own
and through the institutions we

00:01:09.276 --> 00:01:13.197
participate in.
It's very important and it has

00:01:13.197 --> 00:01:17.527
some important
financial–there are a lot

00:01:17.527 --> 00:01:22.724
of financial institutions built
around dealing with the

00:01:22.724 --> 00:01:26.670
fundamental problems of real
estate.

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.171
I want to talk first about
institutions and then move to

00:01:31.171 --> 00:01:33.300
what I think is,
myself,

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.711
more interesting,
which is the real estate boom

00:01:36.711 --> 00:01:41.011
and the kind of fluctuations
we've seen in real estate over

00:01:41.011 --> 00:01:44.108
the years.
I'm going to start out by

00:01:44.108 --> 00:01:49.050
talking about commercial real
estate and the kind of vehicles

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:53.250
that we use to invest in
commercial real estate.

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.634
Then I want to talk about
mortgages, which is the way that

00:01:57.634 --> 00:02:02.250
we finance both commercial and
owner-occupied real estate.

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.192
Then finally,
I want to come to the real

00:02:05.192 --> 00:02:08.060
estate boom that we are recently
in.

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:24.431
Let me start by--the way--the
kind of institution that you

00:02:24.431 --> 00:02:31.359
probably know relatively little
about--or commercial real

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:35.220
estate.
Commercial real estate--that

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.399
means real estate owned not by
individual households but by

00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:47.222
businesses.
The institution I wanted to

00:02:47.222 --> 00:02:55.272
talk to you about first is
called a DPP,

00:02:55.272 --> 00:03:05.040
a Direct Participation Program,
which has been traditionally

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:10.837
the single most important form
of holding of commercial real

00:03:10.837 --> 00:03:13.266
estate.
When you drive along and you

00:03:13.266 --> 00:03:16.108
see all these commercial
buildings, you might wonder who

00:03:16.108 --> 00:03:18.993
owns them.
Well, sometimes they're owned

00:03:18.993 --> 00:03:22.505
by corporations,
but I think the more important

00:03:22.505 --> 00:03:28.729
institution is the DPP,
which is a financial vehicle

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:37.360
that owns commercial real estate
on behalf of investors.

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:53.847
The most important DPP is
called a limited partnership or

00:03:53.847 --> 00:03:57.147
LP.
There's a very simple reason

00:03:57.147 --> 00:04:01.193
why real estate tends to be held
in limited partnerships rather

00:04:01.193 --> 00:04:04.912
than corporations and that
reason is the corporate profits

00:04:04.912 --> 00:04:09.916
tax.
Corporations are taxed on their

00:04:09.916 --> 00:04:16.288
profits and DPPs are not.
You want, if you are setting up

00:04:16.288 --> 00:04:21.110
an organization to hold real
estate, you want to do it,

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:28.574
if you can, as a DPP because
you don't want to pay those

00:04:28.574 --> 00:04:31.782
taxes.
Whenever possible,

00:04:31.782 --> 00:04:38.384
an ownership vehicle for
commercial real estate will have

00:04:38.384 --> 00:04:44.276
the form of a DPP.
A limited partnership is one

00:04:44.276 --> 00:04:49.889
kind of DPP and it has--it's not
a corporation,

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:54.139
so it's a partnership.
The simplest kind of

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:57.920
partnership would be if several
of you got together and formed a

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.434
business.
In a normal--in a simple

00:05:00.434 --> 00:05:04.844
partnership, the partnership
would not be taxed because it's

00:05:04.844 --> 00:05:07.759
you doing business just as
partners,

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:12.579
so you are taxed but not the
partnership.

00:05:12.579 --> 00:05:15.693
The problem with partnerships,
generally, has been that they

00:05:15.693 --> 00:05:20.109
don't have limited liability.
A corporation is an entity that

00:05:20.109 --> 00:05:25.129
could be sued or could lose more
money than it's worth,

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:29.394
but the value of a corporation
can never fall below zero to the

00:05:29.394 --> 00:05:33.658
investors because the investors
are not liable for the mistakes

00:05:33.658 --> 00:05:36.814
of the corporation.
If you buy stock in a company

00:05:36.814 --> 00:05:39.257
the most you can lose is the
money you put up,

00:05:39.257 --> 00:05:41.319
so that's called limited
liability.

00:05:41.319 --> 00:05:46.380
If you take part in a
partnership you are individually

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:50.389
liable for the debts of the
corporation.

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:53.447
That's a problem with the
partnership structure because

00:05:53.447 --> 00:05:56.957
you could join a partnership and
the partnership does something

00:05:56.957 --> 00:06:00.241
awful and loses more than you
put into it and they can come

00:06:00.241 --> 00:06:03.650
after you for those losses.
There is something,

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:08.108
however, called a limited
partnership that has two kinds

00:06:08.108 --> 00:06:12.566
of partners: a general partner
and a limited partner--or

00:06:12.566 --> 00:06:15.449
usually,
many limited partners.

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:19.300
The general partner takes on
the liability;

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:23.959
the limited partners don't have
liability.

00:06:23.959 --> 00:06:26.443
So typically,
real estate is held in a

00:06:26.443 --> 00:06:28.621
limited partnership.
It's limited

00:06:28.621 --> 00:06:31.133
because–well,
they want to put it in a

00:06:31.133 --> 00:06:34.640
limited partnership because they
don't--it's not easy to sell

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:37.912
other people on joining the
partnership if they could get

00:06:37.912 --> 00:06:40.250
unlimited liability for doing
so.

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:45.925
There is a general partner who
takes on the liability and the

00:06:45.925 --> 00:06:48.763
limited partners,
who are many,

00:06:48.763 --> 00:06:54.060
are the participants who do not
share the liability.

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:57.944
The general partner is
typically the organizer of the

00:06:57.944 --> 00:07:01.290
partnership.
Someone who buys a fifty-story

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:05.662
building downtown and then,
well, arranges to buy and gets

00:07:05.662 --> 00:07:09.880
partners--limited partners--to
join in financing it;

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:14.326
that's the arrangement.
You have a general partner,

00:07:14.326 --> 00:07:20.160
then limited partners,
and you don't hear about DPPs.

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:23.587
I'm telling you something that
you probably haven't heard a lot

00:07:23.587 --> 00:07:26.903
about.
This is not commonly advertised

00:07:26.903 --> 00:07:31.630
or described--just like hedge
funds are not commonly

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:35.893
advertised and
described--because it is thought

00:07:35.893 --> 00:07:41.084
that DPPs are suitable only for
wealthy and sophisticated

00:07:41.084 --> 00:07:44.911
investors.
They're complicated,

00:07:44.911 --> 00:07:51.442
so the general rule has been
that only accredited investors

00:07:51.442 --> 00:07:59.650
should participate in them.
I mentioned this before--in the

00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:02.051
U.S.
and in other countries as well,

00:08:02.051 --> 00:08:05.803
they're a similar thing.
We defined an accredited

00:08:05.803 --> 00:08:11.503
investor as someone who can
participate in a DPP or other

00:08:11.503 --> 00:08:17.951
sophisticated programs.
The definition is in Regulation

00:08:17.951 --> 00:08:22.980
D, which defines an accredited
investor.

00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:27.290
For many years now,
to qualify as an accredited

00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:32.724
investor, you have to have one
million dollars in wealth or

00:08:32.724 --> 00:08:37.409
income in excess of $200,000 or,
if you're married,

00:08:37.409 --> 00:08:42.418
$300,000 for the couple.
In 2006--I mentioned this

00:08:42.418 --> 00:08:46.286
before--in 2006,
the SEC proposed raising the

00:08:46.286 --> 00:08:51.650
definition to make it harder to
be an accredited investor,

00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:56.514
but they haven't done that yet;
so, it remains at one million

00:08:56.514 --> 00:08:59.612
dollars to do it.
Nonetheless,

00:08:59.612 --> 00:09:02.794
DPPs don't advertise.
You see mutual fund

00:09:02.794 --> 00:09:06.211
advertisements everywhere.
You don't see advertisements

00:09:06.211 --> 00:09:09.836
for participation in commercial
real estate like this because

00:09:09.836 --> 00:09:13.279
the government would be on their
backs if they did it.

00:09:13.279 --> 00:09:16.058
Since it's available only to
accredited investors,

00:09:16.058 --> 00:09:19.289
you can't be advertising
because everyone would see it;

00:09:19.289 --> 00:09:24.639
that's why the financing of a
lot of this real estate is

00:09:24.639 --> 00:09:29.795
something of a mystery,
because they can't talk openly

00:09:29.795 --> 00:09:34.729
about it.
These DPPs go back a long time

00:09:34.729 --> 00:09:42.679
but there began to be complaints
about them because people said,

00:09:42.679 --> 00:09:45.426
well why is it,
because I'm not an accredited

00:09:45.426 --> 00:09:49.233
investor, I can't get into real
estate like these other people

00:09:49.233 --> 00:09:51.586
do?
Why isn't there something

00:09:51.586 --> 00:09:56.340
offered to me that's like a DPP
that's available to everyone?

00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:59.675
Another way of putting it,
the government is effectively

00:09:59.675 --> 00:10:03.010
saying that unaccredited
investors are free to invest in

00:10:03.010 --> 00:10:06.709
corporations that invest in real
estate and they're subject to

00:10:06.709 --> 00:10:10.765
the corporate profits tax.
Wealthy people have the choice

00:10:10.765 --> 00:10:13.940
of getting around the corporate
profits tax.

00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:16.775
So, in a sense,
the tax structure was

00:10:16.775 --> 00:10:18.407
regressive.
It was saying,

00:10:18.407 --> 00:10:21.096
we're going to have lower taxes
on rich people than on ordinary

00:10:21.096 --> 00:10:24.868
people;
that didn't seem fair at all,

00:10:24.868 --> 00:10:31.889
so there was a complaint aired
about DPPs in the late 1950s.

00:10:31.889 --> 00:10:34.598
People said,
let's change it,

00:10:34.598 --> 00:10:40.789
let's make it so that everybody
can have something like a DPP.

00:10:40.789 --> 00:10:49.457
Congress finally acted and it
was in the year 1960 that

00:10:49.457 --> 00:10:58.125
Congress defined a new
investment vehicle called a Real

00:10:58.125 --> 00:11:08.480
Estate Investment Trust;
this is for everyone.

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:11.611
A Real Estate Investment Trust
is for small investors,

00:11:11.611 --> 00:11:14.388
although wealthy,
big investors can invest in it

00:11:14.388 --> 00:11:20.099
also.
So, they had to make a

00:11:20.099 --> 00:11:26.827
distinction.
These are called REITs,

00:11:26.827 --> 00:11:32.833
Real Estate Investment Trusts.
Congress had to make a

00:11:32.833 --> 00:11:35.735
distinction between these and
corporations and it's kind of a

00:11:35.735 --> 00:11:38.684
subtle distinction because there
are lots of corporations that

00:11:38.684 --> 00:11:41.079
own real estate.
Like, for example,

00:11:41.079 --> 00:11:45.370
Wal-Mart might want to--they
pay corporate profits tax.

00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:48.630
After 19--I don't know if
Wal-Mart--was it around in 1960?

00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:53.159
I don't know.
Let's say it was.

00:11:53.159 --> 00:11:57.055
Wal-Mart, after the 1960 Act of
Congress, would say,

00:11:57.055 --> 00:12:00.340
hey we're a real estate
investment trust,

00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:04.121
we own real estate--all these
stores--but that's not what the

00:12:04.121 --> 00:12:07.202
intent of this bill was.
They wanted REITs to be

00:12:07.202 --> 00:12:11.091
companies that just owned real
estate and Wal-Mart is primarily

00:12:11.091 --> 00:12:17.209
a retailer.
They specified that 75% of

00:12:17.209 --> 00:12:28.495
assets must be real estate and
75% of income must be real

00:12:28.495 --> 00:12:39.580
estate income--so that would be
ruling out Wal-Mart.

00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:47.420
And 95% of income must be paid
out--they can't retain earnings.

00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:56.220
That limits it further.
They're supposed to be like a

00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:58.762
pass through vehicle--they're
owning real estate on your

00:12:58.762 --> 00:13:01.120
behalf, so they shouldn't be
retaining earnings.

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:05.820
Also, they had to be long-term
holders;

00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:13.950
it had to be less than 30% of
income from sales of properties

00:13:13.950 --> 00:13:21.538
less than four years--less
than–no more than 30% of

00:13:21.538 --> 00:13:28.313
their income from sale of
properties had to be from

00:13:28.313 --> 00:13:34.140
properties held less than four
years.

00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:36.780
They didn't want flippers;
they didn't want the company

00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:39.712
that's speculating in real
estate, they want it to be a

00:13:39.712 --> 00:13:44.965
holder of real estate.
Real Estate Investment Trusts

00:13:44.965 --> 00:13:50.070
became very important in three
waves.

00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:57.473
One--the first wave of REIT
growth occurred right after

00:13:57.473 --> 00:14:04.880
Congress passed the 1960 bill.
The first wave was in the 1960s

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:09.167
and, at that time,
Congress had limits--state

00:14:09.167 --> 00:14:14.622
governments had limits on the
interest that savings banks

00:14:14.622 --> 00:14:18.519
could pay people on their
accounts.

00:14:18.519 --> 00:14:24.077
So, a lot of people switched
from savings accounts to

00:14:24.077 --> 00:14:28.460
REITs--that's called
disintermediation.

00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:33.509
An intermediary is a bank,
so when they pull out of banks

00:14:33.509 --> 00:14:39.100
they were disintermediating and
going from banks into REITs.

00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:41.332
Although, in some sense,
it wasn't really

00:14:41.332 --> 00:14:44.680
disintermediation because you
could say a REIT is a different

00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:48.419
kind of intermediary between the
individual and the investment.

00:14:48.419 --> 00:14:55.220
The second boom in REITs
occurred after 1986.

00:14:55.220 --> 00:15:00.663
The Tax Reform Act of 1986 made
DPPs much less valuable to

00:15:00.663 --> 00:15:05.820
investors, and so a lot of
wealthy people switched from

00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:09.063
DPPs to REITs.
Before 1986,

00:15:09.063 --> 00:15:15.919
the tax law allowed use of DPPs
as a tax loss device.

00:15:15.919 --> 00:15:19.190
People would invest in
buildings solely for tax

00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:23.385
purposes because you could write
off the depreciation on the

00:15:23.385 --> 00:15:26.547
building,
so people were cynically

00:15:26.547 --> 00:15:30.090
setting up DPPs as tax shelters
only.

00:15:30.090 --> 00:15:32.786
Congress said,
finally--I think wisely--in

00:15:32.786 --> 00:15:36.338
1986, that we don't want to
create rules that encourage

00:15:36.338 --> 00:15:40.679
people to do a different sort of
business just to evade taxes.

00:15:40.679 --> 00:15:45.880
So, they made a--they said that
losses that--depreciation

00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:50.059
that--In 1986,
the Tax Reform Act of 1986 said

00:15:50.059 --> 00:15:55.910
that depreciation on structures
in DPPs is called a passive loss

00:15:55.910 --> 00:16:00.740
and can be used to offset only
passive income,

00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:04.419
which comes from something like
another DPP.

00:16:04.419 --> 00:16:07.120
So it eliminated the tax
advantage.

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:11.782
If they didn't have a
particular tax advantage to

00:16:11.782 --> 00:16:17.337
DPPs, they went into REITs.
The third REIT boom was in the

00:16:17.337 --> 00:16:22.720
1990s and I think this third
REIT boom is different from the

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:28.195
others because it didn't arise
from any government regulation

00:16:28.195 --> 00:16:31.796
change.
It arose from the beginnings of

00:16:31.796 --> 00:16:36.809
the housing bubble--the real
estate bubble that we're now in.

00:16:36.809 --> 00:16:39.950
There just became a lot of
enthusiasm for REITs.

00:16:39.950 --> 00:16:43.091
It's not just a bubble;
it's also that REITs began to

00:16:43.091 --> 00:16:46.248
be more diversified.
They have many different kinds

00:16:46.248 --> 00:16:48.840
of REITs for different kinds of
real estate.

00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:54.090
It became a more interesting
and diverse asset class.

00:16:58.529 --> 00:17:00.690
That's what I wanted to say
about commercial real estate.

00:17:00.690 --> 00:17:03.194
The two principle ways that
commercial–well,

00:17:03.194 --> 00:17:06.177
there are three ways.
One is commercial real estate

00:17:06.177 --> 00:17:09.105
is held by corporations in the
line of business,

00:17:09.105 --> 00:17:11.910
but after that it would be DPPs
and REITs.

00:17:11.910 --> 00:17:16.271
We have democratized--Now,
REITs are a rapidly growing

00:17:16.271 --> 00:17:21.208
force in investing and now we
have substantially democratized

00:17:21.208 --> 00:17:25.899
real estate holdings so it's not
exclusively DPPs that are

00:17:25.899 --> 00:17:30.590
holding--not primarily--we have
a lot of REITs now.

00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:38.109
Next topic, I want to talk
about mortgages.

00:17:38.109 --> 00:17:47.619
Mortgages are debts secured by
property as collateral.

00:17:47.619 --> 00:17:53.313
When you mortgage a property
that means that you offer the

00:17:53.313 --> 00:17:56.910
property as collateral for a
loan.

00:17:56.910 --> 00:18:02.738
That means that if you fail to
pay on the loan,

00:18:02.738 --> 00:18:10.339
the property is taken by the
lender to satisfy your debts.

00:18:10.339 --> 00:18:13.210
It makes it possible for people
to borrow who otherwise couldn't

00:18:13.210 --> 00:18:15.863
borrow.
If you put a property up as

00:18:15.863 --> 00:18:20.349
collateral, then the lender
knows that they can get the

00:18:20.349 --> 00:18:29.172
money back from you.
The critical thing is the

00:18:29.172 --> 00:18:37.190
loan-to-value ratio,
or LTV.

00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:41.466
A mortgage lender doesn't want
to lend more than the property

00:18:41.466 --> 00:18:46.170
is worth because that would mean
a loan-to-value ratio over one.

00:18:46.170 --> 00:18:51.067
Then if you fail to pay on the
mortgage--pay off the debt--the

00:18:51.067 --> 00:18:54.599
lender can seize the property
and sell it.

00:18:54.599 --> 00:18:57.435
But if the loan to value ratio
is greater than one,

00:18:57.435 --> 00:19:00.099
they won't be able to get all
the money back.

00:19:00.099 --> 00:19:04.669
Moreover, whenever they seize a
property and try to sell it,

00:19:04.669 --> 00:19:08.309
it usually loses value anyway
in the process.

00:19:08.309 --> 00:19:10.987
For example,
if there's a homeowner who

00:19:10.987 --> 00:19:15.074
you've lent money to and the
homeowner is defaulting on the

00:19:15.074 --> 00:19:17.513
mortgage,
the homeowner might wreck the

00:19:17.513 --> 00:19:20.612
house--that happens all the
time--or they might steal things

00:19:20.612 --> 00:19:22.855
from it.
Who knows, they're angry and

00:19:22.855 --> 00:19:26.640
they're living in this house.
They can stall you for a year;

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:29.077
you're trying to sell the
house, they hire lawyers and sue

00:19:29.077 --> 00:19:30.660
you and you've got to hire
lawyers.

00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:33.879
There are lots of costs,
so you want to have a

00:19:33.879 --> 00:19:37.171
loan-to-value ratio,
which is sufficiently low,

00:19:37.171 --> 00:19:41.250
that the collateral will cover
the value of the loan.

00:19:41.250 --> 00:19:49.722
The history of mortgages is
that they have generally over

00:19:49.722 --> 00:19:58.043
time gotten more easy on
loan-to-value ratio and also on

00:19:58.043 --> 00:20:02.555
maturity.
The maturity of a mortgage is

00:20:02.555 --> 00:20:10.812
the date when it's paid off.
If we go back to the 1920s--and

00:20:10.812 --> 00:20:20.578
I'll compare that with now--the
typical mortgage had a

00:20:20.578 --> 00:20:31.450
loan-to-value ratio of 60% and a
maturity of five years,

00:20:31.450 --> 00:20:35.797
often even less than that.
They also had--they were--back

00:20:35.797 --> 00:20:39.534
then, in the 1920s,
they were called balloon

00:20:39.534 --> 00:20:42.864
payment.
What that means is that you

00:20:42.864 --> 00:20:47.702
would borrow $5,000 to buy a
house and in five years and

00:20:47.702 --> 00:20:52.628
every year along the way you'd
be paying interest on your

00:20:52.628 --> 00:20:56.442
mortgage.
Then, in five years you had to

00:20:56.442 --> 00:20:59.245
come up with $5,000.
It was interest,

00:20:59.245 --> 00:21:03.039
interest, interest until the
end and then it was the $5,000.

00:21:03.039 --> 00:21:05.946
Of course, five years is too
short because most people live

00:21:05.946 --> 00:21:07.849
in a house for more than five
years.

00:21:07.849 --> 00:21:11.272
But, the assumption was,
well, when five years comes up

00:21:11.272 --> 00:21:13.970
you refinance the mortgage;
you get a new one.

00:21:13.970 --> 00:21:16.588
The banks weren't willing to
lend more than five years

00:21:16.588 --> 00:21:19.376
because they didn't trust you;
they thought things would

00:21:19.376 --> 00:21:24.051
change and whatever.
After 1929, real estate prices

00:21:24.051 --> 00:21:29.910
fell dramatically and people
became unemployed.

00:21:29.910 --> 00:21:35.559
The unemployment rate in the
United States rose to 25%.

00:21:35.559 --> 00:21:40.294
Lots of people could not
refinance their mortgages

00:21:40.294 --> 00:21:44.830
because they were unemployed.
You go to a bank and say,

00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:48.590
I want to borrow to refinance
my mortgage, which is due now.

00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:52.150
They're asking me to pay $5,000;
I don't have $5,000.

00:21:52.150 --> 00:21:54.910
But the bank would say,
hey you're unemployed;

00:21:54.910 --> 00:21:57.880
we can't give you a mortgage.
Anyway, your loan-to-value

00:21:57.880 --> 00:22:01.118
ratio is getting pretty
precarious because your house is

00:22:01.118 --> 00:22:04.095
now down 30% in value;
your loan-to-value ratio,

00:22:04.095 --> 00:22:07.710
if we were to give you $5,000,
would be something like 90%.

00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:10.049
They would say,
no way are we going to do that;

00:22:10.049 --> 00:22:13.839
our rule says we can't lend on
a LTV of higher than 60%.

00:22:13.839 --> 00:22:17.278
So, people would be turned down
for the refinancing of their

00:22:17.278 --> 00:22:19.140
mortgage.
What happened?

00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:23.834
They would lose the house.
That happened in huge numbers

00:22:23.834 --> 00:22:31.744
in the 1930s.
The 1930s was the biggest

00:22:31.744 --> 00:22:40.019
housing crisis in U.S.
history.

00:22:40.019 --> 00:22:42.950
You see what the problem was:
the mortgages were too short.

00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:46.933
The loan-to-value ratio--well
it's not so much the loan--the

00:22:46.933 --> 00:22:50.782
maturity was short and the
balloon payment at the end that

00:22:50.782 --> 00:22:55.591
they changed.
In 1933, under the Roosevelt

00:22:55.591 --> 00:23:00.953
Administration,
Congress created something

00:23:00.953 --> 00:23:07.884
called the Home Owners'--I
mention this--it's actually

00:23:07.884 --> 00:23:15.470
relevant to right now--Home
Owners' Loan Corporation,

00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:22.762
or HOLC, that was financed by
the U.S.

00:23:22.762 --> 00:23:26.210
Congress.
It started offering,

00:23:26.210 --> 00:23:29.667
indirectly, but started
offering mortgages to all these

00:23:29.667 --> 00:23:33.859
people who couldn't refinance.
It did it through banks;

00:23:33.859 --> 00:23:38.666
they gave the money to banks to
make loans to people who were in

00:23:38.666 --> 00:23:42.063
trouble.
They created a very important

00:23:42.063 --> 00:23:44.577
change.
They said five years is too

00:23:44.577 --> 00:23:48.220
short--it's got to be
longer--they said fifteen years.

00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:53.000
And get rid of this balloon
payment thing at the end--that

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.760
was a dumb idea.
People can't pay that,

00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:58.773
if they're in any trouble,
they can't come up with the

00:23:58.773 --> 00:24:00.990
whole value of the loan all at
once.

00:24:00.990 --> 00:24:04.829
They demanded that the
mortgages be

00:24:04.829 --> 00:24:10.250
self-amortizing--this is what
came in in 1933.

00:24:10.250 --> 00:24:13.640
It was a very important change
in mortgage finance.

00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:16.893
Self-amortizing means that
you're not just paying the

00:24:16.893 --> 00:24:20.521
interest every year--or every
month--you're paying interest

00:24:20.521 --> 00:24:23.649
plus principal.
So, when the mortgage ends,

00:24:23.649 --> 00:24:26.378
you're just clear and free;
you don't have to pay

00:24:26.378 --> 00:24:27.609
anything--nothing comes at the
end.

00:24:27.609 --> 00:24:33.150
The HOLC said,
that's a lot more sensible;

00:24:33.150 --> 00:24:35.589
so they demanded that that be
done.

00:24:35.589 --> 00:24:37.830
Of course, banks would be
reluctant to do it by

00:24:37.830 --> 00:24:40.948
themselves, but the government's
coming with a checkbook to write

00:24:40.948 --> 00:24:44.146
the money,
so they can make the mortgage,

00:24:44.146 --> 00:24:46.994
and guarantees it.
The HOLC said,

00:24:46.994 --> 00:24:50.759
don't worry if they don't pay,
we'll pay.

00:24:50.759 --> 00:24:54.539
So, the banks said,
of course we'll do that;

00:24:54.539 --> 00:24:58.349
that created a major change in
mortgage lending.

00:24:58.349 --> 00:25:00.867
This is especially relevant
because--I don't know if you

00:25:00.867 --> 00:25:03.660
saw--maybe you did--in The
New York Times yesterday,

00:25:03.660 --> 00:25:06.505
Alan Blinder,
who is a Former Vice Chairman

00:25:06.505 --> 00:25:10.300
of the Federal Reserve Board
under Greenspan and is now a

00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:13.817
Professor at Princeton,
had an article saying,

00:25:13.817 --> 00:25:16.579
we need to bring back the HOLC
now.

00:25:16.579 --> 00:25:21.440
In fact, our own Senator
Christopher Dodd has a bill in

00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:26.390
Congress right now to bring back
the HOLC, basically.

00:25:26.390 --> 00:25:30.728
He has a new name for it--I
think it's called Home Equity

00:25:30.728 --> 00:25:34.680
Protection Corporation--but
almost the same idea.

00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:38.711
Ideas that were common--that
were new--in the 1930s are being

00:25:38.711 --> 00:25:41.204
brought back.
We don't have to make the

00:25:41.204 --> 00:25:43.308
change.
Well in a sense,

00:25:43.308 --> 00:25:47.584
the other thing that happened
was, in 1934,

00:25:47.584 --> 00:25:53.589
Congress set up the Federal
Housing Administration--FHA.

00:25:53.589 --> 00:25:58.345
The FHA is specifically aimed
at guaranteeing mortgages for

00:25:58.345 --> 00:26:03.100
low-income people and it was a
vision that Roosevelt had to

00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:08.430
bring more and more people into
owning homes in this country.

00:26:08.430 --> 00:26:12.869
The FHA went further than the
HOLC;

00:26:12.869 --> 00:26:18.352
they demanded that mortgages be
twenty years and also

00:26:18.352 --> 00:26:21.917
self-amortizing.
Maybe it was more of a

00:26:21.917 --> 00:26:25.859
paternalistic role of government
that came in then.

00:26:25.859 --> 00:26:29.118
The government said the private
sector, with these kinds of

00:26:29.118 --> 00:26:31.309
mortgages, is not doing things
right;

00:26:31.309 --> 00:26:35.270
it's not planning for our
future in the right way.

00:26:35.270 --> 00:26:38.952
So they made the switch.
It was really the government

00:26:38.952 --> 00:26:41.507
that made the switch from
five-year mortgages to the

00:26:41.507 --> 00:26:44.068
long-term mortgages.
Now today, the standard

00:26:44.068 --> 00:26:47.436
mortgage, which you would
probably get when you buy your

00:26:47.436 --> 00:26:51.110
first house, is not fifteen or
twenty--it's thirty years.

00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:53.981
Well, they just kept going up.
The thirty-year mortgage came

00:26:53.981 --> 00:26:56.664
in the early 1950s but it seems
to have gotten stuck at

00:26:56.664 --> 00:26:58.274
thirty-year.
That's because,

00:26:58.274 --> 00:27:01.733
well, when you buy your first
house you might be twenty-five,

00:27:01.733 --> 00:27:04.500
so thirty years brings you to
age fifty-five;

00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:06.480
that's close enough to
retirement.

00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:10.125
I guess most people think
thirty years is long enough,

00:27:10.125 --> 00:27:13.220
but that's the way mortgages go
ever since.

00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:18.026
We have to--what we've seen
recently--we had more government

00:27:18.026 --> 00:27:22.099
intervention back then in the
mortgage industry.

00:27:22.099 --> 00:27:25.439
Since the 1990s,
we've seen a proliferation of

00:27:25.439 --> 00:27:29.297
new kinds of mortgages that
especially are offered to

00:27:29.297 --> 00:27:32.340
low-income people by certain
lenders.

00:27:40.390 --> 00:27:43.179
We've had a growth in
popularity of ARMs,

00:27:43.179 --> 00:27:45.830
which are adjustable rate
mortgages.

00:27:52.529 --> 00:27:56.413
Adjustable rate mortgages have
a long term--they might last for

00:27:56.413 --> 00:28:00.235
thirty years--but the interest
rate is not fixed for the whole

00:28:00.235 --> 00:28:04.070
thirty years.
A typical ARM is two and

00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:08.918
twenty-eight,
which means that it has a low

00:28:08.918 --> 00:28:13.420
teaser rate for two years--a
teaser,

00:28:13.420 --> 00:28:18.972
hat they call it--and then
rates that go up after two years

00:28:18.972 --> 00:28:24.430
and then tied to some other
benchmark rate of interest,

00:28:24.430 --> 00:28:29.513
like the Treasury bill rate.
The problem is then that these

00:28:29.513 --> 00:28:34.940
were sold to low-income people,
in many cases,

00:28:34.940 --> 00:28:38.822
who didn't understand what they
were getting and that after two

00:28:38.822 --> 00:28:41.390
years the interest rate would
reset up.

00:28:41.390 --> 00:28:45.571
So we would see resets after
two years to a much higher level

00:28:45.571 --> 00:28:49.822
and some of these people would
discover that they can't afford

00:28:49.822 --> 00:28:53.773
them.
We need--and there's a lot of

00:28:53.773 --> 00:28:59.846
talk in Congress right now--we
need to think about new

00:28:59.846 --> 00:29:04.430
regulations that protect
individuals,

00:29:04.430 --> 00:29:09.609
much like the regulations that
the HOLC and the FHA made.

00:29:09.609 --> 00:29:13.367
We have to do it again because
the mortgage institutions have

00:29:13.367 --> 00:29:16.841
deteriorated somewhat.
There's a lot of anger about

00:29:16.841 --> 00:29:19.868
this--I know that on Thursday
Angelo Mozilo,

00:29:19.868 --> 00:29:23.238
who's head of Countrywide,
which is one of the biggest

00:29:23.238 --> 00:29:25.894
mortgage lenders to low income
people and made a lot of

00:29:25.894 --> 00:29:29.006
subprime loans,
is being called before a House

00:29:29.006 --> 00:29:32.725
Committee to testify.
I want to try to watch it if

00:29:32.725 --> 00:29:35.232
possible.
It's going to be interesting,

00:29:35.232 --> 00:29:38.392
because there's a lot of anger
about what's happened,

00:29:38.392 --> 00:29:41.370
similar to the anger that we
saw in the 1930s.

00:29:41.370 --> 00:29:47.332
HOLC is no longer with us;
it was actually set up as a

00:29:47.332 --> 00:29:51.359
temporary corporation by the
government.

00:29:51.359 --> 00:29:59.114
The FHA is still with us and we
just had an FHA Modernization

00:29:59.114 --> 00:30:02.720
Act;
Congress is starting to propel

00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:07.628
that forward so it'll be a
bigger part of our-–

00:30:07.628 --> 00:30:13.289
I wanted to say a little bit
about the math of mortgages.

00:30:13.289 --> 00:30:18.448
The typical--I'm going to talk
about the conventional

00:30:18.448 --> 00:30:23.309
thirty-year mortgage,
which has been a standard in

00:30:23.309 --> 00:30:28.170
the United States ever since the
early 1950s.

00:30:28.170 --> 00:30:34.220
It's not a standard in most
countries, actually.

00:30:34.220 --> 00:30:37.556
I think it was partly the New
Deal legislation that made it

00:30:37.556 --> 00:30:39.569
very strong in the United
States.

00:30:39.569 --> 00:30:45.460
In Canada, the mortgages tend
to be shorter term.

00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:48.455
It's something like what we had
in the '30s, although they have

00:30:48.455 --> 00:30:50.630
other institutions that protect
homebuyers,

00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:58.140
so they don't see the turmoil
that we saw in the 1930s.

00:30:58.140 --> 00:31:09.015
A typical home--a conventional
thirty-year--this is what most

00:31:09.015 --> 00:31:18.259
people get today and
that's--except for subprime.

00:31:18.259 --> 00:31:22.070
Subprime borrowers seem to be
the ones who are being really

00:31:22.070 --> 00:31:25.440
hit with new ideas.
But if most people who are good

00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:28.779
borrowers, who know what they're
doing, want these,

00:31:28.779 --> 00:31:31.422
they want a conventional
thirty-year mortgage because it

00:31:31.422 --> 00:31:34.450
will fix a mortgage payment for
the rest of the thirty years and

00:31:34.450 --> 00:31:39.009
you have nothing to worry about.
If you can afford the mortgage

00:31:39.009 --> 00:31:43.400
payment, then you're all set.
You just pay it every month and

00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:46.119
then you just stop paying at the
end of thirty years.

00:31:46.119 --> 00:31:51.362
If they quote the rate on the
mortgage, call that

00:31:51.362 --> 00:31:57.369
r--traditionally,
you would be paying monthly.

00:31:57.369 --> 00:32:00.940
If you do it in monthly terms
your interest rate is

00:32:00.940 --> 00:32:04.940
r/12 because there are
twelve months in a year.

00:32:04.940 --> 00:32:09.880
How do they figure out what the
mortgage payment is?

00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:24.802
Well, the mortgage balance is
equal to the mortgage payment

00:32:24.802 --> 00:32:36.380
times--now we just use the
annuity formula,

00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:40.326
which is the formula that we've
learned again--we've seen it

00:32:40.326 --> 00:32:47.538
again and again.
[1/ (r/12)][1 –

00:32:47.538 --> 00:32:54.619
1/(1 +
r/12)^(12T)],

00:32:54.619 --> 00:33:06.850
where T is the term,
in years, of the mortgage.

00:33:15.170 --> 00:33:21.554
I should maybe make this the
same--have to get my brackets

00:33:21.554 --> 00:33:24.509
right.
This is just the annuity

00:33:24.509 --> 00:33:28.777
formula, remember?
What this equation merely says

00:33:28.777 --> 00:33:33.523
is that the present value of
your remaining payments is

00:33:33.523 --> 00:33:37.039
always equal to the mortgage
balance.

00:33:37.039 --> 00:33:41.603
This is how they actually
compute the payments because you

00:33:41.603 --> 00:33:45.766
can take, if you want--if
someone is borrowing--let's

00:33:45.766 --> 00:33:50.009
bring it up to today--they're
borrowing $200,000.

00:33:50.009 --> 00:33:53.709
The median price of a home
today is just over $200,000 in

00:33:53.709 --> 00:33:56.957
the U.S.
If it's an 80% mortgage,

00:33:56.957 --> 00:34:02.024
you would be borrowing
$160,000, so you'd have a

00:34:02.024 --> 00:34:06.660
$160,000 here and you know what
this is.

00:34:06.660 --> 00:34:09.262
Whatever the mortgage rate is
quoted, you substitute it into

00:34:09.262 --> 00:34:11.821
this formula and you find out
what the square bracket thing

00:34:11.821 --> 00:34:13.632
is.
Then to get the monthly

00:34:13.632 --> 00:34:17.421
payment, you take the square
bracketed thing and you divide

00:34:17.421 --> 00:34:21.210
by the mortgage balance and
that's the monthly payment;

00:34:21.210 --> 00:34:25.161
that's how it's calculated.
One peculiar property of

00:34:25.161 --> 00:34:30.204
this--incidentally,
at every point of time this

00:34:30.204 --> 00:34:34.699
thing holds, this is time to
maturity.

00:34:34.699 --> 00:34:41.445
This is years to go and so
12T would be the number

00:34:41.445 --> 00:34:47.195
of months to go before it ends.
At every point of time your

00:34:47.195 --> 00:34:51.140
mortgage balance is equal to
your mortgage payment times that

00:34:51.140 --> 00:34:54.363
square bracketed thing,
where T is the amount of

00:34:54.363 --> 00:34:57.547
time you have left.
Suppose you are moving after

00:34:57.547 --> 00:35:02.041
five years, you took out a
thirty-year mortgage and you're

00:35:02.041 --> 00:35:05.757
moving after five years.
When you first bought the house

00:35:05.757 --> 00:35:08.882
they told you what the mortgage
payment was and they're fixing

00:35:08.882 --> 00:35:10.880
that forever,
well for thirty years.

00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:14.260
When you get--when you sell the
house, what do they do?

00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:17.618
They go back to this formula.
If you sold it after five

00:35:17.618 --> 00:35:20.537
years, then there are
twenty-five years left,

00:35:20.537 --> 00:35:23.389
so 25 x 12 is the number of
months left;

00:35:23.389 --> 00:35:25.239
they plug that into this
formula.

00:35:25.239 --> 00:35:28.773
The mortgage payment was
decided when you took out the

00:35:28.773 --> 00:35:33.022
mortgage, so that never changes;
they than figure out what your

00:35:33.022 --> 00:35:35.892
mortgage balance is.
Then the deal is that when you

00:35:35.892 --> 00:35:38.164
sell the house they
subtract--you've got to pay

00:35:38.164 --> 00:35:39.807
this.
They subtract this from the

00:35:39.807 --> 00:35:42.625
purchase price of the house and
then you've got the cash to go

00:35:42.625 --> 00:35:45.969
and buy another house.
That's how it works, okay?

00:35:45.969 --> 00:35:49.618
It's very important to
understand that the mortgage

00:35:49.618 --> 00:35:53.340
balance is recomputed,
according to this formula,

00:35:53.340 --> 00:35:56.763
every month and they will send
you a statement showing how your

00:35:56.763 --> 00:36:00.577
mortgage balance is falling.
A peculiar property of this is

00:36:00.577 --> 00:36:04.748
that the mortgage balance falls
slowly at first and then it

00:36:04.748 --> 00:36:07.518
gradually picks up;
it's just a property of this

00:36:07.518 --> 00:36:09.638
formula.
When you first buy a house most

00:36:09.638 --> 00:36:11.769
of your payment is going to
interest.

00:36:11.769 --> 00:36:15.334
Your mortgage payment is
constant through time but the

00:36:15.334 --> 00:36:18.965
fraction of it that goes to
paying off principal versus

00:36:18.965 --> 00:36:23.000
interest changes through time
and it just changes as dictated

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:25.455
by this formula.
That's because,

00:36:25.455 --> 00:36:29.163
at the end if--suppose you're
one month or two months away

00:36:29.163 --> 00:36:33.023
from the payoff of the mortgage,
you don't have any balance

00:36:33.023 --> 00:36:36.312
left, so the interest that
you're paying is--hardly any

00:36:36.312 --> 00:36:39.966
balance left--is very low and so
you're payment is paying off

00:36:39.966 --> 00:36:42.570
principal,
mostly.

00:36:42.570 --> 00:36:46.280
Whereas, at the beginning,
the mortgage balance is

00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:50.218
dropping only very slowly
because you've got a lot of

00:36:50.218 --> 00:36:54.610
interest to pay and your
mortgage payment is constant.

00:36:54.610 --> 00:37:00.011
So, that's a funny property of
conventional mortgages--that the

00:37:00.011 --> 00:37:04.976
mortgage balance declines very
slowly at first and then it

00:37:04.976 --> 00:37:08.810
falls rapidly when it comes to
maturity.

00:37:17.710 --> 00:37:22.739
I'll just mention--I want to
mention a couple other

00:37:22.739 --> 00:37:28.170
institutions that are very
important in real estate and

00:37:28.170 --> 00:37:34.239
those are Fannie and Freddie.
In 1938, as part of the New

00:37:34.239 --> 00:37:40.043
Deal--I'll just write Fannie Mae
1938--under the Roosevelt

00:37:40.043 --> 00:37:45.746
Administration in order to
further work on the problem in

00:37:45.746 --> 00:37:49.512
housing,
which was still troubling them,

00:37:49.512 --> 00:37:53.530
they created a government
institution called Federal

00:37:53.530 --> 00:37:58.168
National Mortgage Corporation.
People on Wall Street found

00:37:58.168 --> 00:38:01.716
that difficult to say--Federal
National Mortgage

00:38:01.716 --> 00:38:05.340
Corporation--so they nicknamed
it Fannie Mae;

00:38:05.340 --> 00:38:09.605
it sounds like a woman's name.
The idea was that they would

00:38:09.605 --> 00:38:15.432
help advance the mortgage market
by buying up mortgages from

00:38:15.432 --> 00:38:20.864
mortgage originators and
therefore allowing them to make

00:38:20.864 --> 00:38:25.629
more mortgages.
They would buy mortgages from

00:38:25.629 --> 00:38:31.469
originators.
What is an originator?

00:38:31.469 --> 00:38:35.610
An originator is a company that
lends money to households;

00:38:35.610 --> 00:38:39.697
they raise money and then they
lend it out as mortgages to

00:38:39.697 --> 00:38:42.185
households.
Then they deal with the

00:38:42.185 --> 00:38:46.109
households by having a local
office and telling people what

00:38:46.109 --> 00:38:49.965
their balance is and calling
them up if they're not paying

00:38:49.965 --> 00:38:53.983
and that sort of thing.
Well, they were--a servicer is

00:38:53.983 --> 00:38:57.877
someone who--might make a
distinction between originator

00:38:57.877 --> 00:39:00.378
and servicer.
The originator is the one makes

00:39:00.378 --> 00:39:02.664
the loan;
the servicer is someone who

00:39:02.664 --> 00:39:06.924
manages the paying of the loan.
Congress thought that these

00:39:06.924 --> 00:39:11.765
people could be given more money
to operate if someone would buy

00:39:11.765 --> 00:39:15.920
the mortgages from them,
so Fannie Mae started doing

00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:20.451
that in 1938.
Then the government created a

00:39:20.451 --> 00:39:26.998
second such institution
called--and they gave it a boy's

00:39:26.998 --> 00:39:32.949
name--with a nickname,
boy's name--Freddie Mac.

00:39:32.949 --> 00:39:38.065
So, the government created
competitors and it privatized

00:39:38.065 --> 00:39:43.460
them so that both Fannie and
Freddie became what are called

00:39:43.460 --> 00:39:48.390
GSEs--these are Government
Sponsored Enterprises.

00:39:56.309 --> 00:39:59.713
Technically,
Fannie and Freddie are private

00:39:59.713 --> 00:40:02.550
companies--they're traded
stocks;

00:40:02.550 --> 00:40:04.769
you can buy shares in Fannie
and Freddie.

00:40:04.769 --> 00:40:08.702
They're not part of the
government, but they were

00:40:08.702 --> 00:40:13.535
created by the government and
they are massive supporters of

00:40:13.535 --> 00:40:17.445
the housing market.
The general market assumes--and

00:40:17.445 --> 00:40:20.190
also the government still
regulates them.

00:40:20.190 --> 00:40:24.408
It tells how--there's a
conforming loan limit that is a

00:40:24.408 --> 00:40:29.096
limit on how much Fannie and
Freddie--how big a mortgage they

00:40:29.096 --> 00:40:33.222
can make to one homeowner.
It was just part of the new

00:40:33.222 --> 00:40:36.656
President Bush's plan to
increase the conforming loan

00:40:36.656 --> 00:40:40.683
limits on Fannie and Freddie to
allow them to lend at a higher

00:40:40.683 --> 00:40:42.715
price.
So, you can see the government

00:40:42.715 --> 00:40:45.635
is still involved in them.
While they're technically

00:40:45.635 --> 00:40:49.126
private companies now,
they are still thought to be

00:40:49.126 --> 00:40:51.500
related to the U.S.
Government.

00:40:51.500 --> 00:40:54.733
People are willing to lend to
these organizations at low

00:40:54.733 --> 00:40:57.790
interest rates because they
think there's an implicit

00:40:57.790 --> 00:41:01.219
government guarantee.
There are critics of Fannie and

00:41:01.219 --> 00:41:03.749
Freddie who say,
the government guarantee

00:41:03.749 --> 00:41:07.732
doesn't sound right because why
is the government guaranteeing a

00:41:07.732 --> 00:41:09.847
private company?
On the other hand,

00:41:09.847 --> 00:41:11.989
the government says,
it's not guaranteeing them.

00:41:11.989 --> 00:41:14.987
But nobody believes the
government when they say that

00:41:14.987 --> 00:41:17.119
because people say,
surely the U.S.

00:41:17.119 --> 00:41:19.531
Government is not going to
allow Fannie and Freddie to

00:41:19.531 --> 00:41:21.137
fail.
This is very important

00:41:21.137 --> 00:41:23.420
suddenly, now with the housing
crisis.

00:41:23.420 --> 00:41:26.860
If you just saw the news
yesterday, Fannie Mae is

00:41:26.860 --> 00:41:30.300
predicting, well,
they are predicting that Fannie

00:41:30.300 --> 00:41:34.243
Mae is going to make huge losses
in their latest earning

00:41:34.243 --> 00:41:37.044
statement.
It's still--they can make

00:41:37.044 --> 00:41:40.220
losses for a long time before
they're in trouble,

00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:43.000
so presumably there won't be a
problem,

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:47.783
but in principle there could be
and so that's the kind of issue

00:41:47.783 --> 00:41:50.753
that we have now.
I want to talk about the

00:41:50.753 --> 00:41:53.950
current boom and I have so much
to say about this.

00:42:26.679 --> 00:42:32.131
This is the plot that I created
for the second edition of my

00:42:32.131 --> 00:42:35.550
book, Irrational
Exuberance,

00:42:35.550 --> 00:42:38.593
that shows the real estate
market in the United States

00:42:38.593 --> 00:42:42.965
since 1890.
What is really significant--I

00:42:42.965 --> 00:42:49.340
created this plot just a couple
of years, in 2005.

00:42:49.340 --> 00:42:53.497
To my surprise,
nobody had before created a

00:42:53.497 --> 00:42:57.159
hundred-year long home price
index,

00:42:57.159 --> 00:43:01.178
which seems surprising to me
because the long history of home

00:43:01.178 --> 00:43:03.590
prices seems like a relevant
fact;

00:43:03.590 --> 00:43:07.293
we want to know what markets do.
A lot of people have the

00:43:07.293 --> 00:43:10.266
impression that home prices only
go up and that they're a

00:43:10.266 --> 00:43:13.286
wonderful investment.
I thought we should try to find

00:43:13.286 --> 00:43:18.036
out what home prices have done.
I constructed a series of home

00:43:18.036 --> 00:43:24.223
prices--that's the red line and
the red line is--you can see how

00:43:24.223 --> 00:43:30.504
it's moved through history.
It has suddenly shot up in the

00:43:30.504 --> 00:43:33.650
latest years;
this is since the late 1990s.

00:43:33.650 --> 00:43:38.323
This behavior recently,
I think, confirms that we are

00:43:38.323 --> 00:43:43.625
living in a very unusual time in
the housing market and it's

00:43:43.625 --> 00:43:47.130
going to put a lot of stress on
us.

00:43:47.130 --> 00:43:51.049
The only other time we've seen
a boom like this was right after

00:43:51.049 --> 00:43:54.210
World War II and that's shown by
this line here;

00:43:54.210 --> 00:43:58.272
that wasn't as big.
After World War II,

00:43:58.272 --> 00:44:02.486
there were two things that,
I think, contributed to the

00:44:02.486 --> 00:44:06.889
huge housing boom at that time.
One of them was that the U.S.

00:44:06.889 --> 00:44:11.963
Government had shut down the
construction industry during the

00:44:11.963 --> 00:44:17.289
war, so they didn't build any
houses for close to five years;

00:44:17.289 --> 00:44:19.420
obviously we had a shortage of
housing.

00:44:19.420 --> 00:44:22.902
The other thing was the
soldiers came back from World

00:44:22.902 --> 00:44:27.398
War II and they wanted families.
They started something that you

00:44:27.398 --> 00:44:31.404
may have heard of called The
Baby Boom, so the birth rate

00:44:31.404 --> 00:44:34.409
shot way up and everyone wanted
a home.

00:44:34.409 --> 00:44:37.767
One bedroom wasn't good enough
anymore, they wanted--you don't

00:44:37.767 --> 00:44:40.080
want the baby in the same room
with you;

00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:43.843
you want to have two bedrooms.
You might even want two

00:44:43.843 --> 00:44:47.690
bathrooms, so the demand for
housing went up.

00:44:47.690 --> 00:44:53.808
The current boom is different
because there's nothing like

00:44:53.808 --> 00:44:57.780
that happening and so it's
strange.

00:44:57.780 --> 00:45:00.320
The question is:
what caused the current boom?

00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:02.579
I have some other data shown
here.

00:45:02.579 --> 00:45:08.423
The green line is the building
costs and you can see that

00:45:08.423 --> 00:45:11.449
building costs,
since 1890,

00:45:11.449 --> 00:45:15.039
in real terms--everything is
corrected for inflation--have

00:45:15.039 --> 00:45:18.559
gone up a little bit since 1890,
but not a whole lot.

00:45:18.559 --> 00:45:22.297
In fact, for the last--this is
the Engineering News Record

00:45:22.297 --> 00:45:26.203
Building Cost Index;
it's an index used by people in

00:45:26.203 --> 00:45:29.173
the construction industry.
Since around 1980,

00:45:29.173 --> 00:45:30.730
building costs have been
falling.

00:45:30.730 --> 00:45:33.580
That, I think,
is partly because the biggest

00:45:33.580 --> 00:45:36.630
single component of building
costs is labor.

00:45:36.630 --> 00:45:40.060
As you know,
income inequality is getting

00:45:40.060 --> 00:45:45.291
worse, low-income wages are not
going up, so that component of

00:45:45.291 --> 00:45:49.150
housing has been declining in
real terms.

00:45:49.150 --> 00:45:52.039
The other components are not
doing much.

00:45:52.039 --> 00:45:56.740
The other thing I have down is
population, although the

00:45:56.740 --> 00:46:00.500
population of the U.S.
has been pretty steady--that

00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:03.483
pink line looks awfully
steady--and I have interest

00:46:03.483 --> 00:46:05.265
rates.
Now a lot of people talk about

00:46:05.265 --> 00:46:07.101
interest rates.
I was just reading Alan

00:46:07.101 --> 00:46:09.750
Greenspan's new book,
The Age of Turbulence.

00:46:09.750 --> 00:46:11.929
I don't know if you saw this;
it came out last year.

00:46:11.929 --> 00:46:14.960
He said, he didn't think there
was a bubble.

00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:18.024
I don't know how he could not
think there was a bubble,

00:46:18.024 --> 00:46:20.845
but he didn't see it.
His honest--he said,

00:46:20.845 --> 00:46:25.090
maybe froth in the real estate
market but not a bubble.

00:46:25.090 --> 00:46:29.306
Anyway, I was reading--well,
why didn't he think there was a

00:46:29.306 --> 00:46:30.681
bubble?
He said, well part of the

00:46:30.681 --> 00:46:31.940
reason is interest rates were
coming down.

00:46:31.940 --> 00:46:35.329
If interest rates are coming
down, as you can see they are,

00:46:35.329 --> 00:46:38.777
that means the rate of discount
is going down in the present

00:46:38.777 --> 00:46:41.150
value formula,
so asset pricing should go up.

00:46:41.150 --> 00:46:45.959
I guess that's plausible.
It doesn't match up very well

00:46:45.959 --> 00:46:49.434
though because interest rates
have been going down since 1980

00:46:49.434 --> 00:46:52.435
and the boom is very sudden,
so it seems to me that

00:46:52.435 --> 00:46:55.010
Greenspan should have seen this
bubble coming.

00:46:55.010 --> 00:47:01.299
What caused--that's the--I
wanted to show you one city--I

00:47:01.299 --> 00:47:08.150
actually do a short comparison
between a couple of cities--Los

00:47:08.150 --> 00:47:12.748
Angeles and Milwaukee.
Is there anyone here from Los

00:47:12.748 --> 00:47:15.110
Angeles?
We've got a good number.

00:47:15.110 --> 00:47:19.298
What about Milwaukee?
Nobody from Milwaukee--I might

00:47:19.298 --> 00:47:25.039
be insulting Milwaukeeans when I
talk about this--not really.

00:47:25.039 --> 00:47:29.080
Milwaukee--is there someone up
there?

00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:33.641
No.
Milwaukeeans are much more

00:47:33.641 --> 00:47:42.113
stable than--this is actually
praise for Los--for Milwaukeeans

00:47:42.113 --> 00:47:50.030
not--Milwaukeeans are much more
stable than Angelinos,

00:47:50.030 --> 00:47:52.719
I guess you call them, right?
Los Angeles residents?

00:47:52.719 --> 00:47:56.660
Look what the housing--the blue
line shows what home prices in

00:47:56.660 --> 00:48:00.213
real terms have done in Los
Angeles over the last thirty

00:48:00.213 --> 00:48:02.563
years.
We compare Milwaukee--look at

00:48:02.563 --> 00:48:06.324
that, isn't that amazing?
Milwaukee has been extremely

00:48:06.324 --> 00:48:09.467
steady over this period.
One theory is that,

00:48:09.467 --> 00:48:12.909
well it's, as people say,
I'm going back to Los Angeles.

00:48:12.909 --> 00:48:16.380
The problem with Los Angeles is
that they've had unsteady

00:48:16.380 --> 00:48:20.644
employment and unemployment.
If the economy is sagging,

00:48:20.644 --> 00:48:25.269
then the Los Angeles housing
prices will respond.

00:48:25.269 --> 00:48:28.945
Well, you can see the pink line
shows the employment in Los

00:48:28.945 --> 00:48:31.547
Angeles, and indeed,
it did move around

00:48:31.547 --> 00:48:35.638
corresponding to the booms and
busts in the Los Angeles market

00:48:35.638 --> 00:48:39.248
but not so dramatically.
If you look at Milwaukee,

00:48:39.248 --> 00:48:43.350
the employment figures don't
look that much different than

00:48:43.350 --> 00:48:46.570
Los Angeles.
What's different?

00:48:46.570 --> 00:48:49.875
There's something about Los
Angeles that's different from

00:48:49.875 --> 00:48:53.121
Milwaukee and that is that in
Los Angeles there's just a

00:48:53.121 --> 00:48:59.329
history of volatile markets.
I wanted to try and figure out

00:48:59.329 --> 00:49:02.107
why.
The reason we picked these two

00:49:02.107 --> 00:49:05.949
cities--we asked realtors--Karl
Case, who's my colleague,

00:49:05.949 --> 00:49:08.349
he teaches at Wellesley
College.

00:49:08.349 --> 00:49:10.759
Back in 1988,
when we started this study,

00:49:10.759 --> 00:49:14.132
we asked realtors around the
country, what is the hottest

00:49:14.132 --> 00:49:17.967
market in the United States?
They said, oh that's Los

00:49:17.967 --> 00:49:21.940
Angeles or maybe Anaheim,
which is right outside.

00:49:21.940 --> 00:49:25.078
Then we said,
what's the deadest market in

00:49:25.078 --> 00:49:28.025
the United States?
There wasn't as much agreement

00:49:28.025 --> 00:49:30.619
on that, but one of the names
suggested was Milwaukee;

00:49:30.619 --> 00:49:33.480
nothing has ever happened there
in terms of real estate.

00:49:33.480 --> 00:49:37.818
Now, I think that
ultimately--interestingly

00:49:37.818 --> 00:49:43.706
enough, Los Angeles had a real
estate boom and bust in the

00:49:43.706 --> 00:49:46.440
1880s;
that's hard to believe.

00:49:46.440 --> 00:49:49.570
There was a huge boom in real
estate prices in L.A.

00:49:49.570 --> 00:49:53.159
in--it peaked in 1886 and then
it crashed.

00:49:53.159 --> 00:49:57.932
Now, you might think that's a
long time ago,

00:49:57.932 --> 00:50:00.743
1886?
Isn't that when the cowboys and

00:50:00.743 --> 00:50:04.809
Indians were out there in the
Old West in the covered wagons?

00:50:04.809 --> 00:50:08.685
Well that's right,
but there was a real estate

00:50:08.685 --> 00:50:12.619
boom in Los Angeles.
I went back and studied this

00:50:12.619 --> 00:50:16.335
boom rather extensively
by--there's one book written

00:50:16.335 --> 00:50:18.469
about it.
There's also The L.A.

00:50:18.469 --> 00:50:21.402
Times, which you can get
now online with no problem from

00:50:21.402 --> 00:50:23.489
the--you can read every day's
newspaper.

00:50:23.489 --> 00:50:28.289
It turns out--I was talking
about what happened in L.A.

00:50:28.289 --> 00:50:34.200
in the 1880s--a view arose that
Los Angeles was just the most

00:50:34.200 --> 00:50:38.026
wonderful place on Earth.
The climate out there is

00:50:38.026 --> 00:50:40.942
beautiful, especially if you
feel that on a winter's day like

00:50:40.942 --> 00:50:42.718
today,
you might wish you were

00:50:42.718 --> 00:50:45.219
in--some of you might wish you
were there.

00:50:45.219 --> 00:50:49.448
It wasn't just California,
because California was a huge

00:50:49.448 --> 00:50:53.369
state, with all kinds of--but
mostly empty--land.

00:50:53.369 --> 00:50:57.417
People somehow got the idea
that Los Angeles is just this

00:50:57.417 --> 00:51:01.464
wonderful city and so they
started bidding up real estate

00:51:01.464 --> 00:51:03.624
prices.
You can explain that to me,

00:51:03.624 --> 00:51:07.111
some of you from Los Angeles.
It turned out to be kind of

00:51:07.111 --> 00:51:11.639
wrong because in the 1880s they
started building so many houses

00:51:11.639 --> 00:51:16.239
in response to the demand that
there was eventually a crash;

00:51:16.239 --> 00:51:19.760
but somehow people got this
idea at some time.

00:51:19.760 --> 00:51:23.447
We compared Los--we couldn't go
back in a time machine and do

00:51:23.447 --> 00:51:27.135
questionnaire surveys in the
1880s, but we could do it in the

00:51:27.135 --> 00:51:29.873
1980s.
So, Case and I did identical

00:51:29.873 --> 00:51:34.120
questionnaires in Los Angeles
and Milwaukee and these are

00:51:34.120 --> 00:51:38.548
median price expectations.
In 1988, when there was a boom

00:51:38.548 --> 00:51:42.039
in California,
but of course not in Milwaukee,

00:51:42.039 --> 00:51:45.929
the average person in Los
Angeles thought home prices

00:51:45.929 --> 00:51:50.117
would go up 10% a year for the
next ten years--that's the

00:51:50.117 --> 00:51:52.210
median,
I'm sorry.

00:51:52.210 --> 00:51:55.449
10% a year is a pretty fast
appreciation.

00:51:55.449 --> 00:51:58.970
If it goes on for ten years
that means that the--it'll

00:51:58.970 --> 00:52:02.291
double in seven years,
so it'd be going up like two

00:52:02.291 --> 00:52:06.115
and a half fold.
That was quite a nice

00:52:06.115 --> 00:52:08.677
expectation.
If you compare that with

00:52:08.677 --> 00:52:11.220
Milwaukee, they thought only 4%,
which is about the inflation

00:52:11.220 --> 00:52:12.977
rate.
So, there was something

00:52:12.977 --> 00:52:15.750
different between Los Angeles
and Milwaukee.

00:52:15.750 --> 00:52:19.989
The Los Angeles people had
extravagantly high expectations.

00:52:19.989 --> 00:52:24.535
We saw it again in 2003,
when people in Los Angeles

00:52:24.535 --> 00:52:27.990
expected 8% appreciation every
year.

00:52:27.990 --> 00:52:33.617
It's coming down now in 2006;
they're gradually coming down

00:52:33.617 --> 00:52:36.877
as the boom unwinds.
You notice Milwaukee is going

00:52:36.877 --> 00:52:38.877
up.
I think what's happening is

00:52:38.877 --> 00:52:42.309
that we're becoming more
national and Milwaukeeans are

00:52:42.309 --> 00:52:45.610
starting to think more like
Angelinos--that it's one

00:52:45.610 --> 00:52:49.559
boom--so they start to expect it
to happen in Milwaukee.

00:52:49.559 --> 00:52:53.246
Los Angeles and Milwaukee were
tied in 2006 for their

00:52:53.246 --> 00:52:56.050
expectations.
This is the boom.

00:52:56.050 --> 00:53:00.817
People had great fear of being
left out of the real estate

00:53:00.817 --> 00:53:03.195
market.
I think the boom was driven by

00:53:03.195 --> 00:53:05.511
fear.
In 1988, we asked people in Los

00:53:05.511 --> 00:53:09.431
Angeles, are you worried that
unless I buy now I won't be able

00:53:09.431 --> 00:53:14.314
to afford a house in the future?
We had 80% agreement with that

00:53:14.314 --> 00:53:17.260
in Los Angeles;
so people were really worried.

00:53:17.260 --> 00:53:22.052
In Milwaukee, it was only 27%.
You kind of wonder,

00:53:22.052 --> 00:53:25.505
how can it be that people had
such different views depending

00:53:25.505 --> 00:53:29.190
on which city they lived in?
Well, I can kind of explain it;

00:53:29.190 --> 00:53:32.719
there are a couple of factors.
One is, in 1988 home prices

00:53:32.719 --> 00:53:36.812
were rising rapidly in Los
Angeles, not so in Milwaukee,

00:53:36.812 --> 00:53:39.938
so people were just
extrapolating the price

00:53:39.938 --> 00:53:43.074
increase.
The other thing is that Los

00:53:43.074 --> 00:53:47.727
Angeles just has this sense of
its own glamour and excitement

00:53:47.727 --> 00:53:51.450
that--you know it is the home of
movie stars.

00:53:51.450 --> 00:53:56.038
What city is more glamorous?
Beverly Hills is part of Los

00:53:56.038 --> 00:53:59.069
Angeles;
it's the most expensive city in

00:53:59.069 --> 00:54:01.973
the U.S.
This sense, this glamour

00:54:01.973 --> 00:54:07.322
thinking, along with price
increases, caused Los Angeles to

00:54:07.322 --> 00:54:10.860
boom;
so it's the boomiest U.S. city.

00:54:10.860 --> 00:54:16.000
We asked people whether they
had a perception of excitement

00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:20.610
directly and in Los Angeles,
in 1988,54% said yes;

00:54:20.610 --> 00:54:23.800
whereas, in Milwaukee only 21%
said yes.

00:54:23.800 --> 00:54:27.184
As the years go by,
you notice that Milwaukee is

00:54:27.184 --> 00:54:30.570
starting look more and more like
Los Angeles.

00:54:30.570 --> 00:54:32.559
Alan Greenspan,
in his book,

00:54:32.559 --> 00:54:36.834
says that he thinks housing
markets are all local and there

00:54:36.834 --> 00:54:41.182
is no--he says this firmly in
his book--there is no national

00:54:41.182 --> 00:54:44.708
housing market.
In fact, it's becoming more

00:54:44.708 --> 00:54:49.326
national because Milwaukeeans no
longer think that they are some

00:54:49.326 --> 00:54:53.870
kind of outpost that's unrelated
to the excitement of glamorous

00:54:53.870 --> 00:54:56.635
cities;
they see it happening at home

00:54:56.635 --> 00:54:59.167
as well.
Now, I wanted to compare it

00:54:59.167 --> 00:55:03.277
with another question that
I--people have this simple idea

00:55:03.277 --> 00:55:07.756
that there's a best investment.
This is about the stock market,

00:55:07.756 --> 00:55:11.614
but I asked a number of--this
I've been doing since 1996--do

00:55:11.614 --> 00:55:14.360
you agree with the following
statement?

00:55:14.360 --> 00:55:18.142
"The stock market is the best
investment for long-term holders

00:55:18.142 --> 00:55:21.615
who can just buy and hold
through the ups and down of the

00:55:21.615 --> 00:55:24.214
market."
I only started asking this in

00:55:24.214 --> 00:55:27.539
1996 when the stock market boom
was well under way,

00:55:27.539 --> 00:55:31.340
but already 69% of my
respondents, who were

00:55:31.340 --> 00:55:35.050
high-income investors,
strongly agreed.

00:55:35.050 --> 00:55:39.449
That percent grew to the peak
of the market in 1999;

00:55:39.449 --> 00:55:42.269
after the peak in 2000 it began
to fall.

00:55:42.269 --> 00:55:45.513
We see what happens is that
when the markets--people are

00:55:45.513 --> 00:55:48.528
chasing past returns.
When the stock market is going

00:55:48.528 --> 00:55:51.347
up they think that--they
increasingly think that the

00:55:51.347 --> 00:55:53.780
stock market is just the best
investment,

00:55:53.780 --> 00:55:57.236
until when it starts falling,
then they start retracting from

00:55:57.236 --> 00:56:02.565
that.
I didn't have--I lost it--what

00:56:02.565 --> 00:56:05.520
is going on here?

00:56:15.099 --> 00:56:18.030
We see the same thing in real
estate.

00:56:18.030 --> 00:56:22.301
The percent who think it's the
best investment is higher in Los

00:56:22.301 --> 00:56:26.084
Angeles than in Milwaukee,
and since the peak of the

00:56:26.084 --> 00:56:29.127
bubble in 2003,
it's been declining in Los

00:56:29.127 --> 00:56:30.981
Angeles but,
surprisingly,

00:56:30.981 --> 00:56:34.968
rising in Milwaukee.
They've almost--they've pretty

00:56:34.968 --> 00:56:38.162
much converged in 2006.
The lesson is,

00:56:38.162 --> 00:56:41.736
I think, that we have a
glamour-city phenomenon--that

00:56:41.736 --> 00:56:45.791
excitement about real estate
prices--centered in places like

00:56:45.791 --> 00:56:48.463
Los Angeles,
but it's spreading and becoming

00:56:48.463 --> 00:56:50.985
more and more of a national
phenomenon and that's the

00:56:50.985 --> 00:56:54.087
bubble.
Part of--this is the--it's not

00:56:54.087 --> 00:56:59.059
loan-to-value ratio--this is the
ratio of mortgage debt to

00:56:59.059 --> 00:57:02.199
personal consumption
expenditure.

00:57:02.199 --> 00:57:06.230
Over the boom period,
we've been seeing a gradual

00:57:06.230 --> 00:57:09.750
uptrend;
just as loan to value ratios

00:57:09.750 --> 00:57:15.400
were only 60% in the 1920s,
now they're up to 90% or 100%.

00:57:15.400 --> 00:57:19.130
We're much more willing to take
risks on mortgages.

00:57:19.130 --> 00:57:21.349
People are also borrowing much
more.

00:57:21.349 --> 00:57:26.004
You can see that in the early
1950s mortgage debt was only

00:57:26.004 --> 00:57:30.413
something like 25% of personal
consumption expenditure,

00:57:30.413 --> 00:57:35.007
but now it's up to about 100%.
We're much more expansive in

00:57:35.007 --> 00:57:39.181
mortgage financing than we were.
I put this chart out to just

00:57:39.181 --> 00:57:42.519
show the international aspect of
home prices.

00:57:42.519 --> 00:57:46.377
Here, the blue line is the
Case-Shiller Home Price Index

00:57:46.377 --> 00:57:50.236
for greater Boston.
The red line is the Halifax

00:57:50.236 --> 00:57:55.449
Home Price Index for greater
London--we're talking UK now.

00:57:55.449 --> 00:57:59.021
They're both deflated by the
Consumer Price Index or,

00:57:59.021 --> 00:58:02.592
in the case of the UK,
the Retail Price Index to give

00:58:02.592 --> 00:58:06.351
us a real home price.
Isn't it striking how similar

00:58:06.351 --> 00:58:10.179
London and Boston are?
They both had dramatic booms.

00:58:10.179 --> 00:58:14.726
The London boom of the late
1980s is really something--look

00:58:14.726 --> 00:58:17.069
at that.
It went up, peaked,

00:58:17.069 --> 00:58:21.010
suddenly turned around,
came all the back down.

00:58:21.010 --> 00:58:26.036
I don't know what to--and then
it kind of waffled around in

00:58:26.036 --> 00:58:29.590
London and then it shot up even
higher.

00:58:29.590 --> 00:58:32.070
Then, look what's
happened--this is the latest

00:58:32.070 --> 00:58:34.329
quarter--it's starting to fall
rapidly.

00:58:34.329 --> 00:58:38.008
Just a couple of months ago
London seemed to be soaring and

00:58:38.008 --> 00:58:41.495
now suddenly there's this
pessimistic atmosphere because

00:58:41.495 --> 00:58:44.730
we don't know what's going to
happen in London.

00:58:44.730 --> 00:58:50.242
Look how it fell in 2004;
there was this sharp drop and

00:58:50.242 --> 00:58:55.507
most people thought that the
housing boom was over but then

00:58:55.507 --> 00:58:59.320
it went up again to a new peak
in 2007.

00:58:59.320 --> 00:59:03.948
We have an international crisis.
This is another couple of

00:59:03.948 --> 00:59:06.591
countries.
I managed to find price indexes

00:59:06.591 --> 00:59:10.954
for Norway and Netherlands going
back to 1890 and compared that

00:59:10.954 --> 00:59:13.503
with the U.S.
We're seeing a similar pattern

00:59:13.503 --> 00:59:16.673
in all three of these countries.
These are the only countries

00:59:16.673 --> 00:59:19.536
that I've been able to find that
have high-quality,

00:59:19.536 --> 00:59:22.800
repeat sales price indexes
going back a hundred years.

00:59:22.800 --> 00:59:26.419
You can see that in all these
countries real estate prices

00:59:26.419 --> 00:59:30.102
didn't show much trend until
recently and now they all have

00:59:30.102 --> 00:59:33.550
real estate booms.
We have an international boom.

00:59:33.550 --> 00:59:35.894
Why is that?
Why would we have an

00:59:35.894 --> 00:59:38.859
international boom?
I talk about this in the book

00:59:38.859 --> 00:59:41.636
you have, Irrational
Exuberance,

00:59:41.636 --> 00:59:45.730
and I'll let you read that and
not summarize it here.

00:59:45.730 --> 00:59:49.549
But, part of the reason I think
is, globalization is creating a

00:59:49.549 --> 00:59:52.753
global culture and the
excitement and enthusiasm that

00:59:52.753 --> 00:59:56.125
we once saw in isolated cities,
like Los Angeles,

00:59:56.125 --> 01:00:00.630
are spreading out and are seen
more and more around the world.

01:00:00.630 --> 01:00:03.760
It's tied in with our sense of
rapid economic growth.

01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:08.752
We're living in an era of
excited economic optimism and

01:00:08.752 --> 01:00:12.820
it's feeding into home prices in
the U.S.,

01:00:12.820 --> 01:00:16.094
in Europe, in China,
in Korea, in India,

01:00:16.094 --> 01:00:19.787
in South Africa,
Australia, New Zealand--lots

01:00:19.787 --> 01:00:24.825
and lots of places have seen
home price boom and I think it's

01:00:24.825 --> 01:00:30.030
not anything unique to any one
country that explains it;

01:00:30.030 --> 01:00:35.254
it's the psychology.
This is residential investment

01:00:35.254 --> 01:00:40.449
in the United States as a
fraction of GDP.

01:00:40.449 --> 01:00:46.428
I have it shown with the--the
vertical lines on this chart

01:00:46.428 --> 01:00:52.721
indicate recessions and this
shows--this is from 1948 to 2007

01:00:52.721 --> 01:00:58.909
and every recession that we've
had since 1948 is shown.

01:00:58.909 --> 01:01:03.605
For example,
we had a recession that started

01:01:03.605 --> 01:01:09.829
here--I believe that was
'48--and then it ended in '49.

01:01:09.829 --> 01:01:15.290
Then we had another recession
that began in 1953--that's that

01:01:15.290 --> 01:01:18.840
line--and it ended in '54,
and so on.

01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:22.769
The most recent recession we've
had is 2001;

01:01:22.769 --> 01:01:25.630
it began and ended in the same
year, 2001.

01:01:25.630 --> 01:01:30.590
We may be in a recession now;
a lot of people are saying

01:01:30.590 --> 01:01:35.062
that, so I would be tempted to
draw a new line here,

01:01:35.062 --> 01:01:39.360
somewhere around here,
maybe December of 2007.

01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:43.219
The National Bureau of Economic
Research, who announces

01:01:43.219 --> 01:01:46.364
recession dates,
hasn't announced yet whether

01:01:46.364 --> 01:01:49.666
there's a recession,
so we'll probably find out in a

01:01:49.666 --> 01:01:52.430
few more months whether we're
already in a recession.

01:01:52.430 --> 01:01:56.401
I suspect we are.
Now the interesting thing is,

01:01:56.401 --> 01:02:01.371
the green line here is the
expenditure on real estate

01:02:01.371 --> 01:02:03.470
investment.
What does that mean?

01:02:03.470 --> 01:02:06.727
There are three main components.
One is building new houses,

01:02:06.727 --> 01:02:10.282
another one is building new
apartment buildings--that's

01:02:10.282 --> 01:02:14.100
commercial instead of--but it's
still adding to the housing

01:02:14.100 --> 01:02:18.380
stock--and the third one is
improvements of existing houses.

01:02:18.380 --> 01:02:21.547
People put new additions on or
they redo the kitchen and

01:02:21.547 --> 01:02:24.911
bathroom and whatever.
So, we add all of that up and

01:02:24.911 --> 01:02:29.094
that's residential investment.
You can see that residential

01:02:29.094 --> 01:02:33.150
investment, as a fraction of
GDP, has been very variable

01:02:33.150 --> 01:02:37.426
through history of the United
States since World War II and

01:02:37.426 --> 01:02:41.630
that it's had a strong
relationship with recessions.

01:02:41.630 --> 01:02:48.449
You can see what residential
investment has done recently.

01:02:48.449 --> 01:02:54.926
We had a huge peak in
residential investment and the

01:02:54.926 --> 01:03:01.021
peak was a couple of years
ago--I believe 2006 or

01:03:01.021 --> 01:03:08.386
thereabouts--at the level of
residential investment was the

01:03:08.386 --> 01:03:15.369
highest it has been since
1951--that's over here.

01:03:15.369 --> 01:03:18.446
That's the only time since
World War II that we've had a

01:03:18.446 --> 01:03:20.739
higher level of residential
investment.

01:03:20.739 --> 01:03:26.850
Even 1951 was a very unusual
year--I'll tell you why--because

01:03:26.850 --> 01:03:30.719
we were getting into the Korean
War.

01:03:30.719 --> 01:03:37.469
People remembered that during
World War II the U.S.

01:03:37.469 --> 01:03:39.389
Government shut down the
housing market.

01:03:39.389 --> 01:03:42.621
They said, no more new houses
to be built, so everyone

01:03:42.621 --> 01:03:45.913
thought--in fact they were
talking about World War III,

01:03:45.913 --> 01:03:49.293
they were really scared.
You don't remember how awful it

01:03:49.293 --> 01:03:52.734
looked because the U.S.
was proposing to invade Korea

01:03:52.734 --> 01:03:57.171
and then the Soviet Union and
China were being very angry and

01:03:57.171 --> 01:04:01.460
we thought we'd be in some war
with Communist China or some

01:04:01.460 --> 01:04:04.303
awful war.
People got really scared,

01:04:04.303 --> 01:04:07.909
but what they did was
they--this was the Baby Boom.

01:04:07.909 --> 01:04:10.918
They just got back from World
War II, they didn't want another

01:04:10.918 --> 01:04:12.940
war, they wanted to live a
normal life,

01:04:12.940 --> 01:04:16.162
they wanted to have kids,
and then this terrible war was

01:04:16.162 --> 01:04:19.689
coming, they thought.
So, they rushed and bought

01:04:19.689 --> 01:04:22.242
houses.
Everyone was scrambling to get

01:04:22.242 --> 01:04:25.380
a house before they shut down
the housing market.

01:04:25.380 --> 01:04:28.574
It turns out that it didn't
turn into World War III

01:04:28.574 --> 01:04:32.343
and--maybe they did shut down
the housing--or they must have

01:04:32.343 --> 01:04:35.740
curtailed it,
but it created that boom.

01:04:35.740 --> 01:04:39.948
What's causing this boom here?
It's almost as big as the 1951

01:04:39.948 --> 01:04:42.793
boom.
Well, the answer is high

01:04:42.793 --> 01:04:46.896
prices, I believe.
We had this huge bubble in home

01:04:46.896 --> 01:04:50.900
prices and it pushed prices up
to extraordinary levels.

01:04:50.900 --> 01:04:54.619
What does that do to builders?
Well, builders can sell for a

01:04:54.619 --> 01:04:57.659
really high price,
so they start building a lot of

01:04:57.659 --> 01:05:00.097
houses.
They will do it as long as the

01:05:00.097 --> 01:05:03.550
home price is high relative to
their construction costs.

01:05:03.550 --> 01:05:08.638
We've seen a boom in building
in the United States that is at

01:05:08.638 --> 01:05:12.831
a record level,
except for that one Korean War

01:05:12.831 --> 01:05:18.060
blip, and so I think it's a
highly abnormal situation that

01:05:18.060 --> 01:05:22.181
we've been in.
Now, look how suddenly and

01:05:22.181 --> 01:05:25.530
sharply it's correcting
downward.

01:05:25.530 --> 01:05:28.669
Why is it correcting downward?
Well, that's because the

01:05:28.669 --> 01:05:30.610
housing market is now in
decline.

01:05:30.610 --> 01:05:34.512
When the housing market is in
decline, the ability to sell

01:05:34.512 --> 01:05:38.521
houses drops dramatically.
Builders were doing extremely

01:05:38.521 --> 01:05:41.983
well until a couple of years
ago--their stock was

01:05:41.983 --> 01:05:45.590
soaring--now all of a sudden
they're in crisis.

01:05:45.590 --> 01:05:49.590
Well, it's no surprise;
this is what a housing bubble

01:05:49.590 --> 01:05:52.273
does.
You can see various--this is

01:05:52.273 --> 01:05:56.836
the growth rate of home
prices--actually I should update

01:05:56.836 --> 01:05:58.989
this.
This is now tipped negative.

01:05:58.989 --> 01:06:03.860
The peak--this is the
Case-Shiller ten-city index.

01:06:03.860 --> 01:06:06.782
Housing permits have dropped
way off because,

01:06:06.782 --> 01:06:09.969
of course, they're not building
homes anymore.

01:06:09.969 --> 01:06:15.059
This shows a strong seasonality
and then a drop off since 2006.

01:06:15.059 --> 01:06:18.801
Here's my last slide--The
National Association of

01:06:18.801 --> 01:06:23.011
Homebuilders surveys its
membership to ask them what is

01:06:23.011 --> 01:06:27.031
the traffic of homebuyers?
What they mean by that is,

01:06:27.031 --> 01:06:30.717
if you're a builder and you
have this place where you show

01:06:30.717 --> 01:06:34.217
off your model homes,
how many people are coming by

01:06:34.217 --> 01:06:37.909
to look at your model homes
today as potential buyers?

01:06:37.909 --> 01:06:41.579
The blue line is the traffic of
homebuyers.

01:06:41.579 --> 01:06:44.969
You can see that it has reached
the lowest level ever.

01:06:44.969 --> 01:06:48.631
It has dropped precipitously
and you note that the pink line,

01:06:48.631 --> 01:06:51.559
which shows the rate of growth
of home prices,

01:06:51.559 --> 01:06:54.397
the rate of growth of home
prices, has fallen just right

01:06:54.397 --> 01:06:56.409
along with the traffic of
homebuyers.

01:06:56.409 --> 01:06:58.730
I think it's pretty clear
what's happening.

01:06:58.730 --> 01:07:01.429
People saw the rising home
prices;

01:07:01.429 --> 01:07:03.210
they thought they would rise
forever;

01:07:03.210 --> 01:07:06.747
they were flocking in,
trying to get into the housing

01:07:06.747 --> 01:07:09.736
market before it outpriced them.
Now suddenly,

01:07:09.736 --> 01:07:12.704
the word is that it's falling,
so suddenly they don't want

01:07:12.704 --> 01:07:15.880
these homes, so the inventory of
unsold homes has shot up;

01:07:15.880 --> 01:07:19.840
builders can't sell them and
prices are falling.

01:07:19.840 --> 01:07:23.451
That's the situation we're in.
We'll talk more about this very

01:07:23.451 --> 01:07:27.027
interesting situation because it
ties in with so many other

01:07:27.027 --> 01:07:29.027
aspects of financial markets.

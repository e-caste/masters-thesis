00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:14.283
Professor Mark Saltzman:
This is a course,

00:00:14.283 --> 00:00:17.876
a version of which I've taught
almost every year for the last

00:00:17.876 --> 00:00:21.230
twenty years and it evolves a
little bit every year.

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.496
I think I get a little bit
better at it,

00:00:23.496 --> 00:00:27.100
so hopefully you'll get some
advantage from that experience.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.387
But the idea is to try to
present to you what's exciting

00:00:30.387 --> 00:00:34.236
about Biomedical Engineering,
the ways that one can take

00:00:34.236 --> 00:00:38.382
science and mathematics and
apply that to improve human

00:00:38.382 --> 00:00:40.589
health.
I'm not working alone here,

00:00:40.589 --> 00:00:43.627
but we have three teaching
fellows who are affiliated with

00:00:43.627 --> 00:00:45.920
the course, two of which are
here today.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.006
Yen Cu is back there,
Yen raise your hand higher so

00:00:50.006 --> 00:00:53.314
everyone can see.
Yen worked on the course last

00:00:53.314 --> 00:00:56.762
year and she's the senior of the
teaching fellows that are

00:00:56.762 --> 00:01:01.450
working on the course this year.
Serge Kobsa is in the back and

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.620
he'll be the second teaching
fellow.

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.129
I should mention that Yen is a
PhD student in Biomedical

00:01:08.129 --> 00:01:11.765
Engineering and Serge is an
M.D./PhD student who's getting

00:01:11.765 --> 00:01:14.189
his PhD in Biomedical
Engineering.

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.198
The third teaching fellow
couldn't make it today,

00:01:18.198 --> 00:01:23.043
his name is Michael Look and
I'll introduce him to you when

00:01:23.043 --> 00:01:27.537
he's available.
This is the goal for my

00:01:27.537 --> 00:01:32.060
first lecture today,
to try to answer these

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.663
questions.
You might have already noticed

00:01:35.663 --> 00:01:40.290
that I'm using the classes V2
server so the syllabus is there,

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.278
I'm going to go over the
syllabus a little bit later,

00:01:42.278 --> 00:01:43.769
but the syllabus is available
online.

00:01:43.769 --> 00:01:47.484
The first reading is available
online and I'll talk more about

00:01:47.484 --> 00:01:51.260
the readings when I get to that
portion of the lecture here.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.436
I'm going to post PowerPoints
for all the lectures,

00:01:54.436 --> 00:01:58.057
hopefully at least the day
before the lecture takes place,

00:01:58.057 --> 00:02:01.812
so I posted this last night.
Some students find that they

00:02:01.812 --> 00:02:05.381
benefit from printing out the
PowerPoints and they can just

00:02:05.381 --> 00:02:09.072
take their notes along with the
slides as I go and that's one

00:02:09.072 --> 00:02:12.242
way to do it,
but feel free to do it whatever

00:02:12.242 --> 00:02:15.569
way works for you,
but those should be available.

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:18.225
The questions I want to try
to answer today are what is

00:02:18.225 --> 00:02:21.246
Biomedical Engineering?
So why would you be interested

00:02:21.246 --> 00:02:24.500
in spending a semester learning
about this subject?

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.164
I'll talk about who will
benefit from the course and a

00:02:29.164 --> 00:02:34.093
little bit about sort of the
detailed subject matter that

00:02:34.093 --> 00:02:38.229
we'll cover in the course of
this semester.

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:41.683
To answer the question what is
Biomedical Engineering,

00:02:41.683 --> 00:02:45.527
we're going to spend time on
that today and we'll spend time

00:02:45.527 --> 00:02:48.085
on Thursday,
and I want to approach it from

00:02:48.085 --> 00:02:51.452
a couple of different angles.
One is by just showing you

00:02:51.452 --> 00:02:55.158
a series of pictures which you
might recognize and talk about

00:02:55.158 --> 00:02:58.370
why this is an example of
Biomedical Engineering.

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.412
This is one picture that
probably you all know what it is

00:03:02.412 --> 00:03:05.949
when you see it,
it's a familiar looking image.

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:08.735
It's something that probably we
all have some personal

00:03:08.735 --> 00:03:10.050
experience with,
right?

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.738
This is a chest x-ray that
would be taken in your doctor's

00:03:13.738 --> 00:03:16.909
office, for example,
or a radiologist's office.

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:20.718
And it is a good example of
Biomedical Engineering and that

00:03:20.718 --> 00:03:24.861
it takes a physical principle,
that is how do x-rays interact

00:03:24.861 --> 00:03:28.740
with the tissues of your body,
and it uses that physics,

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:32.059
that physical principle to
develop a picture of what's

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:34.690
inside your body,
so to look inside and see

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.009
things that you couldn't see
without this device.

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:40.895
And you'll recognize some of
the parts of the image,

00:03:40.895 --> 00:03:44.598
you can see the ribcage here,
the bones, you can see the

00:03:44.598 --> 00:03:47.970
heart is this large bright
object down here.

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.216
If your - have good eyesight
from the distance that you're at

00:03:52.216 --> 00:03:56.462
you can see the vessels leading
out of the heart and into the

00:03:56.462 --> 00:03:59.612
lungs,
and the lungs are these darker

00:03:59.612 --> 00:04:03.412
spaces within the ribcage.
Physicians over the years

00:04:03.412 --> 00:04:06.286
of having this instrument have
learned how to be very

00:04:06.286 --> 00:04:09.547
sophisticated about looking at
these pictures and diagnosing

00:04:09.547 --> 00:04:12.090
when something is wrong inside
the chest,

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.079
for example.
So this is an example of

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:17.994
Biomedical Engineering,
one that is well integrated

00:04:17.994 --> 00:04:21.376
into our society to the point
that we've probably all got a

00:04:21.376 --> 00:04:24.000
picture like this somewhere in
our past,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.779
and where we understand the
physical principles that allow

00:04:29.779 --> 00:04:32.338
us to use it.
We've gotten,

00:04:32.338 --> 00:04:35.881
over the last two decades in
particular, very sophisticated

00:04:35.881 --> 00:04:39.608
about taking pictures inside the
body allowing doctors to look

00:04:39.608 --> 00:04:42.785
inside the body and predict
things about our internal

00:04:42.785 --> 00:04:46.511
physiology that they couldn't
predict just by looking at us or

00:04:46.511 --> 00:04:50.653
putting their hands on us.
This image on the top here is

00:04:50.653 --> 00:04:54.660
another example of an imaging
technique, this is a Positron

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:57.194
Emission Tomograph,
or PET image,

00:04:57.194 --> 00:05:01.483
and it's taken by using
radionuclides and injecting them

00:05:01.483 --> 00:05:04.083
into you,
so radioactive chemicals that

00:05:04.083 --> 00:05:07.466
interact with tissues in your
body in a specific way and you

00:05:07.466 --> 00:05:09.990
can where those radioactive
chemicals go.

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:13.400
It allows us to look not just
at the anatomy of what's going

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.769
on inside your body like an
x-ray does,

00:05:15.769 --> 00:05:19.852
but to look at the chemistry,
the biochemistry of what's

00:05:19.852 --> 00:05:24.379
happening inside a particular
organ or tissue in your body.

00:05:24.379 --> 00:05:27.500
In this case,
these are pictures of the brain

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:30.550
and this has been an
exceptionally important

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:34.948
technique in understanding how
molecules like neurotransmitters

00:05:34.948 --> 00:05:39.133
affect disease and how they
change in certain disease states

00:05:39.133 --> 00:05:42.390
in people,
and we'll talk about this as

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:46.280
another example of Biomedical
Engineering, this advanced

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:49.180
method is for imaging inside the
body.

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:52.440
Well this third picture you
can't probably see too much

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:55.420
about but you probably recognize
what it is, right?

00:05:55.420 --> 00:06:00.793
Where was this picture taken?
What kind of a space was it

00:06:00.793 --> 00:06:01.210
taken in?

00:06:04.329 --> 00:06:05.423
Student:
[inaudible]Professor

00:06:05.423 --> 00:06:06.303
Mark Saltzman:
Somebody said OR or

00:06:06.303 --> 00:06:08.432
operating room and that's right,
this is a picture in an

00:06:08.432 --> 00:06:10.976
operating room,
and operating rooms if you went

00:06:10.976 --> 00:06:14.295
into any operating room around
the country you would see lots

00:06:14.295 --> 00:06:17.779
of examples of instruments that
are used to help surgeons,

00:06:17.779 --> 00:06:22.582
anesthesiologists to keep the
patient alive and healthy during

00:06:22.582 --> 00:06:26.284
the course of a surgery.
This particular one down

00:06:26.284 --> 00:06:29.831
here, this portion here is a
heart/lung machine and this is a

00:06:29.831 --> 00:06:33.318
machine that can take over the
function of a patient's heart

00:06:33.318 --> 00:06:36.923
and lungs during the period when
they're undergoing open heart

00:06:36.923 --> 00:06:39.170
surgery,
for example.

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:42.651
If they're having a coronary
artery bypass or they're having

00:06:42.651 --> 00:06:45.735
a heart transplant,
then there's some period at

00:06:45.735 --> 00:06:49.629
which their normal heart - their
heart is stopped and this

00:06:49.629 --> 00:06:52.910
machine assumes the functions of
their heart.

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:55.055
And this is,
I think, an obvious example of

00:06:55.055 --> 00:06:57.610
Biomedical Engineering,
building a machine that can

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:00.879
replace the function of one of
your organs even temporarily,

00:07:00.879 --> 00:07:05.220
for example,
during an operation.

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:08.125
This is another familiar
picture, I purposely picked one

00:07:08.125 --> 00:07:10.785
that looked sort of old
fashioned compared to the usual

00:07:10.785 --> 00:07:13.087
way you see this,
which might be on the nightly

00:07:13.087 --> 00:07:14.697
news.
You see a bleep going across

00:07:14.697 --> 00:07:17.489
the screen to indicate that
they've got their finger on the

00:07:17.489 --> 00:07:20.184
pulse of what's happening,
or you see it in TV shows like

00:07:20.184 --> 00:07:21.873
ER.
You see these images on

00:07:21.873 --> 00:07:26.100
computer screens all the time;
it's an example of an EKG or

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:30.382
ECG, an electrocardiograph.
It's a machine that also looks

00:07:30.382 --> 00:07:33.283
inside your body,
but looks inside in a different

00:07:33.283 --> 00:07:36.339
kind of way.
Rather than by forming an image

00:07:36.339 --> 00:07:40.569
or a picture you put electrodes
on the surface of the body and

00:07:40.569 --> 00:07:45.006
measure the electrical potential
as a function of position on the

00:07:45.006 --> 00:07:47.239
body.
It turns out the electrical

00:07:47.239 --> 00:07:50.603
potential or electricity that
you can measure on the surface

00:07:50.603 --> 00:07:54.252
of the body reflects things that
are happening deeper inside like

00:07:54.252 --> 00:07:57.679
the beating of your heart.
If you put the electrodes in

00:07:57.679 --> 00:08:01.117
the right position and you
measure in the right way you can

00:08:01.117 --> 00:08:04.732
detect the electrical activity
of the heart and record it on a

00:08:04.732 --> 00:08:07.400
strip recorder like this one
shown here,

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:11.620
or display it on a computer.
So this is another example of

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:15.996
Biomedical Engineering where you
can look at the function of a

00:08:15.996 --> 00:08:20.371
heart in a living person and a
physician who is experienced at

00:08:20.371 --> 00:08:23.824
looking at these,
and a machine that works well,

00:08:23.824 --> 00:08:27.447
with those two things you can
diagnose a lot of things that

00:08:27.447 --> 00:08:31.320
are happening inside of a heart
and we'll talk about that about

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:35.543
halfway through the course.
This picture might be less

00:08:35.543 --> 00:08:40.211
familiar to you but you probably
all know that we have developed

00:08:40.211 --> 00:08:44.732
over the last 100 years or so
the ability to take cells out of

00:08:44.732 --> 00:08:47.368
a person,
or cells out of an animal,

00:08:47.368 --> 00:08:50.935
and keep those isolated cells
alive in culture for extended

00:08:50.935 --> 00:08:53.764
periods of time:
this technology is called cell

00:08:53.764 --> 00:08:56.610
culture technology.
We're going to spend quite of

00:08:56.610 --> 00:08:59.257
bit of time talking about it
during the third week of the

00:08:59.257 --> 00:09:01.742
course.
By taking cells from the skin,

00:09:01.742 --> 00:09:04.357
for example,
or cells from your blood or

00:09:04.357 --> 00:09:08.649
cells from the bone marrow and
keeping them alive in culture,

00:09:08.649 --> 00:09:12.614
we've been able to study how
human cells work and learn a lot

00:09:12.614 --> 00:09:15.389
about the functioning of human
organism.

00:09:15.389 --> 00:09:19.001
We've also learned how to not
only keep cells alive,

00:09:19.001 --> 00:09:23.250
but in certain cases make them
replicate outside the body,

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:27.290
so maybe you could take a few
skin cells and keep them in

00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:31.475
culture in the right way and
replicate them so that you get

00:09:31.475 --> 00:09:35.659
many millions of skin cells
after several weeks or so.

00:09:35.659 --> 00:09:39.806
Now one of the new
technologies that's evolving,

00:09:39.806 --> 00:09:45.009
that we're going to talk about
in the last half of the course,

00:09:45.009 --> 00:09:49.622
is taking cells that have been
propagated in this way outside

00:09:49.622 --> 00:09:53.620
the body and encouraging them to
form new tissues.

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:57.505
This is one example of that:
this is actually artificial

00:09:57.505 --> 00:09:59.970
skin.
It's in this Petri dish.

00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:03.120
Here is a thin membrane,
it's a polymer scaffold,

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:07.058
and on that polymer scaffold
scientists have placed some skin

00:10:07.058 --> 00:10:09.750
cells and they've allowed it to
grow.

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:13.098
And if you maintained it in the
right way, this polymer scaffold

00:10:13.098 --> 00:10:15.809
together with the skin cells
will grow into skin.

00:10:15.809 --> 00:10:20.074
And you can use this tissue
engineered skin to treat a

00:10:20.074 --> 00:10:23.491
patient who's had severe burns,
for example,

00:10:23.491 --> 00:10:26.919
or a diabetic who's developed
ulcers that won't heal.

00:10:26.919 --> 00:10:30.733
So this is an example of a
technology that's just emerging

00:10:30.733 --> 00:10:34.680
now, it's certainly going to
impact you in your lifetime and

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:37.959
we'll talk about how it works
and what the current

00:10:37.959 --> 00:10:43.644
state-of-the-art is there.
This device held here is

00:10:43.644 --> 00:10:50.860
really made of mainly plastic
and a little bit of metal.

00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:54.361
It's a fully implantable
artificial heart,

00:10:54.361 --> 00:10:59.399
and it was introduced about
seven or eight years ago now.

00:10:59.399 --> 00:11:03.465
It was implanted into the first
patient, a gentleman in

00:11:03.465 --> 00:11:07.906
Kentucky, and he stayed alive
for a period of time with this

00:11:07.906 --> 00:11:12.096
device replacing his heart.
Development of an artificial

00:11:12.096 --> 00:11:15.809
heart, again another example of
Biomedical Engineering,

00:11:15.809 --> 00:11:19.542
is something that people have
been trying to accomplish for

00:11:19.542 --> 00:11:23.082
decades now, and this is the
closest that we've come and

00:11:23.082 --> 00:11:26.557
there are many advantages of
this particular artificial

00:11:26.557 --> 00:11:28.960
heart.
And it's important innovation

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:32.277
in several different ways and
we're going to talk about this

00:11:32.277 --> 00:11:34.919
whole science of building
artificial organs,

00:11:34.919 --> 00:11:39.555
devices that are made out of
totally synthetic components to

00:11:39.555 --> 00:11:43.169
replace the function of your
natural organs,

00:11:43.169 --> 00:11:48.100
and the artificial heart is a
good example of that.

00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:53.862
This picture on the bottom
here is really just a series of

00:11:53.862 --> 00:11:56.266
colored dots.
Some are yellow,

00:11:56.266 --> 00:11:58.611
some are red,
and some are green - does

00:11:58.611 --> 00:12:02.674
anybody know what this is?
Have you seen pictures like

00:12:02.674 --> 00:12:05.430
this?
It's an example of a technology

00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:09.641
called a gene chip that allows
you to, on each one of these

00:12:09.641 --> 00:12:14.180
spots there is DNA for example,
that's specific for a

00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:19.505
particular gene in your genome,
in the human genome for

00:12:19.505 --> 00:12:22.851
example.
By incubating a small sample of

00:12:22.851 --> 00:12:26.279
fluid from a patient on a gene
chip like this,

00:12:26.279 --> 00:12:30.118
where every one of these dots
represents a different gene,

00:12:30.118 --> 00:12:34.091
you can see by looking at the
pattern of colors on this chip

00:12:34.091 --> 00:12:38.132
which genes are being expressed
and which genes are not being

00:12:38.132 --> 00:12:41.230
expressed in that particular
individual.

00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:45.198
So it lets you do a profile of
not just the genes that you

00:12:45.198 --> 00:12:48.751
possess, for example,
but what genes are actually

00:12:48.751 --> 00:12:52.872
being used to make proteins in
the cells that surround the

00:12:52.872 --> 00:12:57.586
fluid where this was collected.
So this has been a remarkable

00:12:57.586 --> 00:12:59.849
innovation.
It's another example of

00:12:59.849 --> 00:13:02.738
Biomedical Engineering
technology that allows us to

00:13:02.738 --> 00:13:05.570
look at what's happening inside
an individual,

00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:08.535
a patient, in a totally
different way than we were

00:13:08.535 --> 00:13:11.113
before.
By looking to see not just what

00:13:11.113 --> 00:13:14.917
genes you carry but what genes
are being used at particular

00:13:14.917 --> 00:13:18.293
times in your life.
This is mainly a research tool

00:13:18.293 --> 00:13:22.417
now, but there's lots of reasons
to believe that this is going to

00:13:22.417 --> 00:13:26.219
change the way that physicians
practice medicine by allowing

00:13:26.219 --> 00:13:30.021
them to diagnose or predict
what's going to happen to you in

00:13:30.021 --> 00:13:34.264
ways that they can't currently.
And so we'll talk about

00:13:34.264 --> 00:13:37.384
technologies like this,
where they're at,

00:13:37.384 --> 00:13:41.753
what the scientific basis of it
is, and how they might be

00:13:41.753 --> 00:13:44.035
useful.
This is an airplane,

00:13:44.035 --> 00:13:47.120
what does that have to do with
Biomedical Engineering?

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:50.651
Well you could stretch it and
say that an example of

00:13:50.651 --> 00:13:54.736
engineering to improve human
health is getting them from one

00:13:54.736 --> 00:13:58.089
place to another,
but that would be more of a

00:13:58.089 --> 00:14:01.499
stretch than I'm going to make.
But it turns out that

00:14:01.499 --> 00:14:04.537
technologies like airplanes,
which were developed in the

00:14:04.537 --> 00:14:06.856
last century,
have become integral parts of

00:14:06.856 --> 00:14:08.541
medicine.
For example,

00:14:08.541 --> 00:14:12.795
you all know that the only
treatment for some diseases is

00:14:12.795 --> 00:14:16.669
to get an organ transplant:
a kidney transplant,

00:14:16.669 --> 00:14:21.164
or a liver transplant is the
only life extending intervention

00:14:21.164 --> 00:14:24.610
that can be done for some kinds
of diseases.

00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:30.443
Transplants require donors,
and the donor organ is usually

00:14:30.443 --> 00:14:36.379
not at the same physical
location that the recipient is,

00:14:36.379 --> 00:14:40.522
and so jets like this one have
become very important in

00:14:40.522 --> 00:14:44.735
connecting donors to recipients.
A team of surgeons is working

00:14:44.735 --> 00:14:48.114
to harvest an organ at one site
while another team of surgeons

00:14:48.114 --> 00:14:51.160
is working to prepare the
recipient at another site,

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:54.789
and the organ is flown there.
Now why does that happen?

00:14:54.789 --> 00:14:57.432
Because you have to get the
organ from one place to another

00:14:57.432 --> 00:14:59.490
fast, right?
The organ has to get from one

00:14:59.490 --> 00:15:02.379
place to another very rapidly
and this is the fastest way to

00:15:02.379 --> 00:15:04.499
do it.
Well what if we could develop

00:15:04.499 --> 00:15:07.627
ways using engineering
techniques to extend the life of

00:15:07.627 --> 00:15:11.450
an organ, so it didn't have to
get it where it went so quickly?

00:15:11.450 --> 00:15:15.444
Then that would open up lots of
more possibilities for organ

00:15:15.444 --> 00:15:17.950
transplantation than are known
now.

00:15:17.950 --> 00:15:20.394
What if we could figure out
ways to avoid organ

00:15:20.394 --> 00:15:23.283
transplantation entirely?
What if we could just take a

00:15:23.283 --> 00:15:26.088
few cells from that donor organ,
ship them to the site,

00:15:26.088 --> 00:15:29.100
grow a new organ at the site
and then implant it there?

00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:32.404
These are examples of
Biomedical Engineering of the

00:15:32.404 --> 00:15:35.220
future that expand on what we
currently use,

00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:43.289
which involves to no small
extent, technology like this.

00:15:43.289 --> 00:15:47.486
I would guess that probably 30%
to 50% of you do this everyday,

00:15:47.486 --> 00:15:51.524
you put a piece of plastic,
a synthetic piece of plastic

00:15:51.524 --> 00:15:54.340
into your eye to improve your
vision.

00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:58.076
Contact lens technology has
changed dramatically from the

00:15:58.076 --> 00:16:01.679
time that I was born to the time
that you were born,

00:16:01.679 --> 00:16:04.348
and the contact lenses you use
today are much different than

00:16:04.348 --> 00:16:06.610
the ones that would have been
used 30 years ago.

00:16:06.610 --> 00:16:08.769
This is Biomedical Engineering
as well.

00:16:08.769 --> 00:16:10.681
Engineers who are developing
new materials,

00:16:10.681 --> 00:16:12.820
materials that can be,
if you think about it,

00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:15.330
there's not very many things
that you would want to put in

00:16:15.330 --> 00:16:18.017
your eye and that you would feel
comfortable putting into your

00:16:18.017 --> 00:16:19.990
eye,
so this is a very safe,

00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:23.110
a very inert material.
What gives it those properties?

00:16:23.110 --> 00:16:26.389
What makes it so safe that it
can be put in one of the most

00:16:26.389 --> 00:16:29.669
sensitive places in your body,
in contact with your eye?

00:16:29.669 --> 00:16:32.794
Why do you have confidence
putting it in contact with one

00:16:32.794 --> 00:16:35.250
of the most important organs of
your body?

00:16:35.250 --> 00:16:39.138
Because you trust biomedical
engineers to have done a good

00:16:39.138 --> 00:16:42.753
job in designing these things
and we'll talk about how

00:16:42.753 --> 00:16:45.549
biomaterials are designed and
tested,

00:16:45.549 --> 00:16:48.563
and what makes a material,
the properties of a material

00:16:48.563 --> 00:16:50.740
that you could use as a contact
lens,

00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:53.110
what are the properties that it
needs to have.

00:17:02.950 --> 00:17:07.059
This is an example of an
artificial hip.

00:17:07.059 --> 00:17:11.242
We've learned a lot about the
mechanics of how humans work as

00:17:11.242 --> 00:17:14.170
organisms over the last 100
years or so,

00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:16.888
how we work as sort of physical
objects that have to obey the

00:17:16.888 --> 00:17:18.609
laws of physics that you know
about.

00:17:18.609 --> 00:17:22.027
We live in a gravitational
field and that it affects our

00:17:22.027 --> 00:17:24.823
day to day life,
and if you have hip pain or a

00:17:24.823 --> 00:17:28.938
hip that's diseased in some way,
and you can't stand up against

00:17:28.938 --> 00:17:32.756
that gravitational field in the
same way, that severely limits

00:17:32.756 --> 00:17:36.565
what you can do in the world.
So biomedical engineers have

00:17:36.565 --> 00:17:40.498
been working for many years on
how to design replacement parts

00:17:40.498 --> 00:17:43.980
for joints like the hip:
the artificial hip is the most

00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:47.237
well developed of those.
We'll talk about this in some

00:17:47.237 --> 00:17:49.525
detail.
You can imagine that there are

00:17:49.525 --> 00:17:53.399
many requirements that a device
like this has to meet in order

00:17:53.399 --> 00:17:57.209
for it to be a good artificial
hip and we'll talk about those

00:17:57.209 --> 00:18:01.147
and how the design of these has
changed over the years and what

00:18:01.147 --> 00:18:04.846
we can expect in the future.
Lastly, up here,

00:18:04.846 --> 00:18:09.056
is a picture of a much smaller
device, this is actually an

00:18:09.056 --> 00:18:13.486
artificial heart valve that is
made of plastics and metal and

00:18:13.486 --> 00:18:16.809
can replace the valve inside
your heart.

00:18:16.809 --> 00:18:21.299
Valvular disease is not
uncommon in the world;

00:18:21.299 --> 00:18:23.920
we'll talk about that a little
bit.

00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:26.706
We'll talk about how your
normal valves function inside

00:18:26.706 --> 00:18:29.853
your heart and how your heart
couldn't work in the way that it

00:18:29.853 --> 00:18:32.846
did if it didn't have valves
that were doing a very complex

00:18:32.846 --> 00:18:35.490
operation many,
many times a day.

00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:40.091
And then we'll talk about how
you can build something to

00:18:40.091 --> 00:18:44.859
replace a complicated small part
in the body like that.

00:18:44.859 --> 00:18:47.150
Well let's take a step back
for a minute;

00:18:47.150 --> 00:18:49.721
that's one way of looking at
Biomedical Engineering,

00:18:49.721 --> 00:18:52.544
by looking at sort of the
things that you know about that

00:18:52.544 --> 00:18:55.771
have been the result of the work
of biomedical engineers and talk

00:18:55.771 --> 00:18:58.020
more generally.
But what is engineering?

00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:01.059
What do engineers do?
What makes engineering

00:19:01.059 --> 00:19:03.839
different than other fields of
study?

00:19:03.839 --> 00:19:07.363
What makes it unique so that we
have a school of engineering at

00:19:07.363 --> 00:19:10.490
Yale that's separate from
science and the humanities?

00:19:14.850 --> 00:19:19.364
Any thoughts?
Student:

00:19:19.364 --> 00:19:20.890
It's more
hands-onProfessor Mark

00:19:20.890 --> 00:19:22.380
Saltzman: It's much more
hands-on.

00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:26.680
You're actually in there doing
things.

00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:32.845
Many of the things I showed you
were things that were built from

00:19:32.845 --> 00:19:36.269
parts, that's a good
description.

00:19:36.269 --> 00:19:38.180
What makes it different from
science?

00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:41.885
Science can be hands-on,
you might be down at the lake

00:19:41.885 --> 00:19:45.172
picking up algae and studying
them or something,

00:19:45.172 --> 00:19:49.470
that would be hands-on.
But what's different - what

00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:52.769
would make you an engineer?
Student:

00:19:52.769 --> 00:19:55.170
[inaudible]Professor
Mark Saltzman:

00:19:55.170 --> 00:19:57.852
You design.
Scientists observe and try to

00:19:57.852 --> 00:20:00.109
describe and engineers try to
design.

00:20:00.109 --> 00:20:02.848
They take those descriptions
and the scientist that is known

00:20:02.848 --> 00:20:04.519
and they try to design new
things,

00:20:04.519 --> 00:20:07.205
and so if you look at a
dictionary it has words like

00:20:07.205 --> 00:20:10.102
this, that you're designing
things or another way to say

00:20:10.102 --> 00:20:12.630
that is that you're trying to
apply science,

00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:16.478
you're looking at applications.
We're trying to take scientific

00:20:16.478 --> 00:20:18.880
information and make something
new.

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:21.371
The other thing about it is
that you could make lots of

00:20:21.371 --> 00:20:23.909
things that are new but
generally you think of engineers

00:20:23.909 --> 00:20:26.769
as making things that are not
just new but they're useful,

00:20:26.769 --> 00:20:29.926
that they do something that
needs to be done,

00:20:29.926 --> 00:20:33.370
and that they do something that
improves life,

00:20:33.370 --> 00:20:40.304
the quality of life of people.
So here is a brief and very

00:20:40.304 --> 00:20:45.490
biased history of engineering.
It's short.

00:20:45.490 --> 00:20:50.541
Engineering became a discipline
in about the middle of the

00:20:50.541 --> 00:20:52.587
1800s.
Lots of universities started

00:20:52.587 --> 00:20:55.119
teaching engineering as a
discipline including Yale.

00:20:55.119 --> 00:20:58.930
In 1852, around that time,
this might have been the first

00:20:58.930 --> 00:21:02.537
course that was offered in
engineering in the country:

00:21:02.537 --> 00:21:06.279
it was taught at Yale in civil
engineering in 1852,

00:21:06.279 --> 00:21:09.009
and even Yale students don't
know this;

00:21:09.009 --> 00:21:10.965
what a long,
distinguished history of

00:21:10.965 --> 00:21:13.410
engineering that their own
institution has.

00:21:13.410 --> 00:21:17.015
In fact, the first PhD degree
in engineering was awarded to a

00:21:17.015 --> 00:21:19.659
fellow named J.
Willard Gibbs at Yale in 1863

00:21:19.659 --> 00:21:22.663
for a thesis he did on how gears
work or something,

00:21:22.663 --> 00:21:26.028
I forget exactly what the
details are, but have you heard

00:21:26.028 --> 00:21:29.269
of Gibbs?
Is it a name that rings a bell?

00:21:29.269 --> 00:21:33.319
Where did you hear about Gibbs
from?

00:21:33.319 --> 00:21:34.214
Student:
[inaudible]Professor

00:21:34.214 --> 00:21:34.972
Mark Saltzman:
Sorry?Student:

00:21:34.972 --> 00:21:35.846
[inaudible]Professor
Mark Saltzman:

00:21:35.846 --> 00:21:37.438
G,
 Gibbs free energy,

00:21:37.438 --> 00:21:40.208
that annoying concept that you
had to try to master in

00:21:40.208 --> 00:21:44.443
chemistry at some point,
but Gibbs is really the father

00:21:44.443 --> 00:21:49.900
of modern physical chemistry and
was one of the most famous

00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:55.546
scientists of the nineteenth
century and got the first PhD in

00:21:55.546 --> 00:22:00.418
engineering here at Yale.
Then from these beginnings,

00:22:00.418 --> 00:22:03.788
engineers transformed life in
the twentieth century:

00:22:03.788 --> 00:22:07.620
a lot of things started in the
twentieth century and became

00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:09.831
common place.
Things like electricity,

00:22:09.831 --> 00:22:12.385
having electricity delivered to
your home, so you had to have

00:22:12.385 --> 00:22:15.067
ways to generate electricity and
to carry it from point to point

00:22:15.067 --> 00:22:16.769
and it was engineers that did
that.

00:22:16.769 --> 00:22:20.724
Built bridges and roads and
automobiles, so we can get from

00:22:20.724 --> 00:22:24.680
one place to another relatively
quickly because of that.

00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:27.676
Because there are airplanes
that were also developed by

00:22:27.676 --> 00:22:30.749
engineers in that century.
We designed a lot of new

00:22:30.749 --> 00:22:34.674
materials that could be used to
build things that couldn't have

00:22:34.674 --> 00:22:38.246
been done otherwise.
Things like steel and polymers,

00:22:38.246 --> 00:22:39.952
or plastics,
and ceramics,

00:22:39.952 --> 00:22:44.116
and of course computers which
has progressed remarkably due to

00:22:44.116 --> 00:22:47.119
the work of engineers in your
lifetime,

00:22:47.119 --> 00:22:50.657
until now you can carry around
a cell phone,

00:22:50.657 --> 00:22:55.099
which would have been
unthinkable even 30 years ago.

00:22:55.099 --> 00:22:58.609
Engineers in the twentieth
century have transformed our

00:22:58.609 --> 00:23:00.444
society.
One of the other things

00:23:00.444 --> 00:23:02.857
that happened during the
twentieth century is that human

00:23:02.857 --> 00:23:04.700
life expectancy increased
dramatically,

00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:06.890
people started living a lot
longer.

00:23:06.890 --> 00:23:10.858
What I plot on this graph here
is as a function time,

00:23:10.858 --> 00:23:14.064
years, dates,
life expectancy as a function

00:23:14.064 --> 00:23:18.436
of time.
What you'll see here is that

00:23:18.436 --> 00:23:24.609
about - for the period before
sort of 1700 or so,

00:23:24.609 --> 00:23:27.697
human life expectancy was less
than 40 years of age,

00:23:27.697 --> 00:23:31.391
so that means a person that was
born in that year could expect

00:23:31.391 --> 00:23:34.721
to live on average about 40
years: that was the expected

00:23:34.721 --> 00:23:37.272
life span.
The expected life spans

00:23:37.272 --> 00:23:41.195
increased dramatically in the
last couple of hundred years

00:23:41.195 --> 00:23:43.841
until now,
for people that were born when

00:23:43.841 --> 00:23:47.170
you were born you can expect to
live to be 80 years old,

00:23:47.170 --> 00:23:50.789
a doubling in life span,
fairly dramatic.

00:23:50.789 --> 00:23:52.470
So what's responsible for
that?

00:23:52.470 --> 00:23:56.011
Why are people living longer
than they did just a few hundred

00:23:56.011 --> 00:23:59.232
years ago?
Well there's a clue here on the

00:23:59.232 --> 00:24:01.529
slide.
I indicated a couple of points

00:24:01.529 --> 00:24:05.103
here where if we looked in the
1665 in London you could ask the

00:24:05.103 --> 00:24:08.331
question - another way to ask
the question why are people

00:24:08.331 --> 00:24:10.810
living so long is to ask the
question,

00:24:10.810 --> 00:24:14.629
why do people die?
In 1665,93% of the people that

00:24:14.629 --> 00:24:18.170
died in that year died of
infectious diseases.

00:24:18.170 --> 00:24:20.968
In contrast,
if you look at a U.S.

00:24:20.968 --> 00:24:26.226
city, ten years ago in 1997 for
example, then people still died

00:24:26.226 --> 00:24:30.297
but they didn't die
predominantly from infectious

00:24:30.297 --> 00:24:33.124
diseases.
They died from other things:

00:24:33.124 --> 00:24:35.289
only 4% died from infectious
diseases.

00:24:35.289 --> 00:24:38.469
So one of the reasons there
is a huge increase in life span

00:24:38.469 --> 00:24:41.545
is because people aren't dying
of things that they would have

00:24:41.545 --> 00:24:46.027
in prior years.
Why the change in infectious

00:24:46.027 --> 00:24:49.009
diseases?
Why did I focus on that one?

00:24:49.009 --> 00:24:53.845
What makes it so much better to
be alive now in terms of your

00:24:53.845 --> 00:24:58.116
likelihood to die of an
infectious disease than it did

00:24:58.116 --> 00:25:00.260
in London in 1665?
Student:

00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:01.370
[inaudible]Professor
Mark Saltzman:

00:25:01.370 --> 00:25:02.210
Yes, but what specifically?

00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:06.221
Student:
[inaudible]Professor

00:25:06.221 --> 00:25:09.359
Mark Saltzman:
Drugs like antibiotics,

00:25:09.359 --> 00:25:12.035
Penicillin, Erythromycin,
again something else you

00:25:12.035 --> 00:25:15.366
probably all had experience with
and you think well that's not

00:25:15.366 --> 00:25:17.660
Biomedical Engineering that's
science,

00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:20.746
that's somebody discovering a
molecule that kills

00:25:20.746 --> 00:25:22.517
microorganisms.
That's true,

00:25:22.517 --> 00:25:24.830
it is science,
but in order for that to go

00:25:24.830 --> 00:25:27.990
from being a science that works
in a laboratory or in one

00:25:27.990 --> 00:25:31.376
hospital to being Penicillin
which could be used all over the

00:25:31.376 --> 00:25:33.465
world,
you've got to be able to make

00:25:33.465 --> 00:25:35.988
it in tremendously large
quantities and that's the work

00:25:35.988 --> 00:25:38.906
of biomedical engineers,
making Penicillin in the kinds

00:25:38.906 --> 00:25:42.219
of quantities that you need so
that a dose could be available

00:25:42.219 --> 00:25:44.980
for everyone in the world if
they got infected,

00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:47.923
and to make it not just in
abundance but make it cheaply

00:25:47.923 --> 00:25:50.009
enough that everyone could
afford it.

00:25:50.009 --> 00:25:55.045
So if you can make 100 tons of
the drug but it costs $100,000 a

00:25:55.045 --> 00:26:00.162
gram that might not be a useful
drug because nobody could afford

00:26:00.162 --> 00:26:03.349
to use it.
So it's the work of biomedical

00:26:03.349 --> 00:26:06.492
engineers, really,
to take these innovations in

00:26:06.492 --> 00:26:09.430
science like drugs and make them
useful,

00:26:09.430 --> 00:26:13.109
make them so that everybody can
take advantage of it.

00:26:13.109 --> 00:26:15.940
You also mentioned vaccines
and we're going to talk a lot in

00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:18.231
the middle part of the course
about vaccines and the

00:26:18.231 --> 00:26:20.753
engineering of immunity.
How do you engineer what

00:26:20.753 --> 00:26:23.648
happens in our immune system in
order to protect us from

00:26:23.648 --> 00:26:26.420
diseases?
That's another example of an

00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:30.320
area where biomedical engineers
have made tremendous

00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:33.339
contributions.
So just to go a little bit

00:26:33.339 --> 00:26:36.910
further with that point,
if you looked at the causes of

00:26:36.910 --> 00:26:40.945
death in London in 1665 here's a
list that I got from a source

00:26:40.945 --> 00:26:45.294
that was written at that time,
and I don't even understand

00:26:45.294 --> 00:26:49.437
what some of these things are,
but the ones in green are

00:26:49.437 --> 00:26:52.600
infectious diseases,
they're infectious causes of

00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:55.552
disease.
Spotted fever in purples for

00:26:55.552 --> 00:27:00.626
example, which we call measles,
was a significant cause of

00:27:00.626 --> 00:27:06.542
death as was the plague,
which we don't have anymore,

00:27:06.542 --> 00:27:10.236
thank goodness.
But people died typically of

00:27:10.236 --> 00:27:13.789
either infectious diseases or
they died during childbirth,

00:27:13.789 --> 00:27:19.233
or they might have died at old
age which would have been 50 or

00:27:19.233 --> 00:27:21.833
so at that time.
In contrast today,

00:27:21.833 --> 00:27:24.481
because we have antibiotics and
we have vaccines,

00:27:24.481 --> 00:27:27.349
people don't die of infectious
diseases as often.

00:27:27.349 --> 00:27:31.714
They live much longer lives and
they live to die of something

00:27:31.714 --> 00:27:36.150
else and the leading causes of
death currently haven't changed

00:27:36.150 --> 00:27:39.715
very much since 1997 when this
data was published:

00:27:39.715 --> 00:27:43.569
they die of heart disease and
cancer primarily.

00:27:43.569 --> 00:27:45.930
Those are the number one and
two causes of death.

00:27:45.930 --> 00:27:50.101
We're going to talk a lot about
how one can use the technology

00:27:50.101 --> 00:27:54.205
that we have now to treat these
kinds of diseases like cancer

00:27:54.205 --> 00:27:57.742
and heart disease.
But why do you think these are

00:27:57.742 --> 00:28:02.511
the number one and two now?
How come these have risen above

00:28:02.511 --> 00:28:07.790
infectious diseases over the
last several hundred years?

00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:15.529
Why is cancer one of the
leading killers in the U.S.

00:28:15.529 --> 00:28:18.540
now but wasn't even on the
charts in 1665?

00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:28.036
Student:
[inaudible]Professor

00:28:28.036 --> 00:28:29.780
Mark Saltzman:
So it could be that -

00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:31.138
what's your name?
Student:

00:28:31.138 --> 00:28:32.867
JustinProfessor Mark
Saltzman: So Justin said it

00:28:32.867 --> 00:28:34.428
could be new things that are
around and you're exposed to

00:28:34.428 --> 00:28:35.990
stuff we weren't exposed to
before and that's true.

00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:38.426
Our environment has changed,
the world has become

00:28:38.426 --> 00:28:41.427
industrialized.
We're exposed to things that

00:28:41.427 --> 00:28:46.084
might cause cancer where weren't
exposed to them before and so

00:28:46.084 --> 00:28:48.742
that might be a reason.
Student:

00:28:48.742 --> 00:28:51.253
they might not know what it
was?Professor Mark

00:28:51.253 --> 00:28:53.809
Saltzman: In 1665,
they weren't diagnosing cancer.

00:28:53.809 --> 00:28:56.724
It was easy to tell if somebody
had an infectious disease but

00:28:56.724 --> 00:28:59.687
you might not have known that
they had cancer at that time and

00:28:59.687 --> 00:29:02.740
they just died.
We didn't have the same methods

00:29:02.740 --> 00:29:06.313
of diagnosis that we do now,
so maybe it was just not

00:29:06.313 --> 00:29:08.136
diagnosed then.
Student:

00:29:08.136 --> 00:29:09.894
[inaudible]Professor
Mark Saltzman:

00:29:09.894 --> 00:29:11.965
People are living longer
and so now they have more

00:29:11.965 --> 00:29:13.450
opportunity to get cancer,
right?

00:29:13.450 --> 00:29:17.999
The longer you live the more
opportunity you have to acquire

00:29:17.999 --> 00:29:22.625
a disease like cancer,
which often is an accumulation

00:29:22.625 --> 00:29:27.250
of defects that occur over a
long period of time.

00:29:27.250 --> 00:29:30.009
So we're going to talk about
cancer.

00:29:30.009 --> 00:29:31.786
For example,
how cancer diagnosis has

00:29:31.786 --> 00:29:34.402
improved, what are some of the
causes of cancer in the

00:29:34.402 --> 00:29:37.265
environment around us and how
can we protect ourselves from

00:29:37.265 --> 00:29:39.649
it,
and we'll talk about treatments

00:29:39.649 --> 00:29:42.974
for it as well.
Cardiovascular disease,

00:29:42.974 --> 00:29:46.589
why is cardiovascular disease
on the top?

00:29:46.589 --> 00:29:48.280
Student:
[inaudible]Professor

00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:49.823
Mark Saltzman:
Obesity or generally our

00:29:49.823 --> 00:29:51.549
diets are different than they
were in 1665.

00:29:51.549 --> 00:29:55.283
We eat different kinds of
things and many people think

00:29:55.283 --> 00:29:59.650
that that's what has contributed
to much more heart disease.

00:29:59.650 --> 00:30:02.700
But it could also be that it
wasn't as easily diagnosed then.

00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:04.955
So people were dying of old age
and that was really heart

00:30:04.955 --> 00:30:07.130
disease that was killing them
they just didn't know,

00:30:07.130 --> 00:30:14.039
so it's multi-factorial and
we'll talk about that.

00:30:14.039 --> 00:30:16.724
I just wanted to show you
this last graph,

00:30:16.724 --> 00:30:20.244
or this last set of statistics
to go from causes of death in

00:30:20.244 --> 00:30:22.651
the U.S.
to causes of death in the

00:30:22.651 --> 00:30:26.712
world, to illustrate that what
happens in the world around us

00:30:26.712 --> 00:30:28.900
in the U.S.
isn't necessarily the same as

00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:30.910
what happens in other places
around the world.

00:30:30.910 --> 00:30:33.613
In other places,
infectious disease is a much

00:30:33.613 --> 00:30:37.422
bigger part of their life and a
much greater risk of death from

00:30:37.422 --> 00:30:40.679
infectious diseases and
parasitic diseases if you live

00:30:40.679 --> 00:30:44.869
in places other than the U.S.
or Western Europe, for example.

00:30:44.869 --> 00:30:49.343
So the problem of infectious
disease prevention and treatment

00:30:49.343 --> 00:30:51.654
isn't solved yet,
you know this,

00:30:51.654 --> 00:30:54.261
right?
So there's plenty of room to

00:30:54.261 --> 00:30:57.852
still innovate in that way,
to develop new methods that

00:30:57.852 --> 00:31:01.575
could protect against diseases
like AIDS or diseases like

00:31:01.575 --> 00:31:05.299
malaria that we don't have
problems with here but they do

00:31:05.299 --> 00:31:09.099
in many parts of the world,
and so we'll talk about that.

00:31:09.099 --> 00:31:14.679
I mentioned the book for
the course and the book is a

00:31:14.679 --> 00:31:18.999
book that I've written.
It's not published yet and so

00:31:18.999 --> 00:31:22.596
I'm going to put chapters from
the book that are in fairly

00:31:22.596 --> 00:31:24.592
final form,
and I think you'll find them

00:31:24.592 --> 00:31:26.339
easy to read,
but you don't have to buy it.

00:31:26.339 --> 00:31:29.748
It's going to be posted on the
Internet and I'll post chapters

00:31:29.748 --> 00:31:32.430
sort of in advance of the
reading assignments.

00:31:32.430 --> 00:31:35.516
If you looked on the classes
server you saw Chapter 1,

00:31:35.516 --> 00:31:38.894
and Chapter 1 describes some of
the sort or organization of

00:31:38.894 --> 00:31:41.690
Biomedical Engineering into
sub-disciplines,

00:31:41.690 --> 00:31:44.813
which I've listed here.
So we're going to talk

00:31:44.813 --> 00:31:48.828
about thinking about the body as
a system, as a system that can

00:31:48.828 --> 00:31:52.584
be understood the same way a
motor could be understood or a

00:31:52.584 --> 00:31:55.109
computer that could be
understood.

00:31:55.109 --> 00:31:58.245
That study is Systems
Physiology and that's an

00:31:58.245 --> 00:32:01.730
important subdivision of
Biomedical Engineering.

00:32:01.730 --> 00:32:06.599
We'll talk about
instrumentation a little bit and

00:32:06.599 --> 00:32:11.773
I've mentioned this,
things like the EKG machine and

00:32:11.773 --> 00:32:17.657
the heart/lung machine are
instruments that are designed to

00:32:17.657 --> 00:32:23.540
either keep patients alive or to
allow you to monitor their

00:32:23.540 --> 00:32:28.230
function over time.
We'll talk about imaging which

00:32:28.230 --> 00:32:32.194
I mentioned, biomechanics or the
study of humans as mechanical

00:32:32.194 --> 00:32:34.734
objects.
We'll talk about a field which

00:32:34.734 --> 00:32:37.715
is growing now called
biomolecular engineering and

00:32:37.715 --> 00:32:40.757
that is the design of
biomaterials or new materials

00:32:40.757 --> 00:32:43.130
that can be implanted in the
body,

00:32:43.130 --> 00:32:47.000
it's new ways of drug delivery.
It's this whole field of tissue

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.279
engineering that I mentioned
earlier.

00:32:49.279 --> 00:32:52.461
We'll talk about artificial
organs and we'll talk about

00:32:52.461 --> 00:32:55.937
systems biology or thinking
about how to acquire information

00:32:55.937 --> 00:32:59.060
for things like gene chips and
use that information to

00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:02.890
understand what's happening in a
complex organism like you.

00:33:02.890 --> 00:33:05.836
Now, I've highlighted three
of these in blue here,

00:33:05.836 --> 00:33:08.449
imaging, mechanics,
and biomolecular engineering

00:33:08.449 --> 00:33:11.729
because if you go on to study
Biomedical Engineering here at

00:33:11.729 --> 00:33:14.999
Yale anyway,
these are the things that you

00:33:14.999 --> 00:33:18.800
might pick to emphasize on.
These are the things that we do

00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:21.969
best and where we have advanced
course work available in these

00:33:21.969 --> 00:33:24.931
three categories and so I'm
going to emphasize these three

00:33:24.931 --> 00:33:27.944
but we'll talk about all of
these subjects as we go through

00:33:27.944 --> 00:33:31.099
the course.
The syllabus is posted online.

00:33:31.099 --> 00:33:33.890
I've just copied it here so you
could take a look at it.

00:33:33.890 --> 00:33:36.688
Week 1 we're trying to talk
about this question,

00:33:36.688 --> 00:33:40.393
what is Biomedical Engineering.
There are some chapters here

00:33:40.393 --> 00:33:42.151
for readings:
Chapters 1,2,

00:33:42.151 --> 00:33:44.268
and 4.
I've only posted Chapter 1,

00:33:44.268 --> 00:33:47.619
which basically reviews the
things I've talked about today.

00:33:47.619 --> 00:33:50.751
Chapters 2 and 4 are really
reviews of things that you

00:33:50.751 --> 00:33:54.238
probably already know something
about, so they're reviews of

00:33:54.238 --> 00:33:58.010
basic chemistry.
So chemical concepts that are

00:33:58.010 --> 00:34:02.655
important for us to all
understand as we move forward

00:34:02.655 --> 00:34:06.140
and review of proteins and
biochemistry,

00:34:06.140 --> 00:34:08.909
basically.
So I'm going to post those

00:34:08.909 --> 00:34:12.210
online and we're not going to
talk about them directly in the

00:34:12.210 --> 00:34:14.630
lectures but they're there as a
resource,

00:34:14.630 --> 00:34:17.631
so if you read about something
like pH and you've forgotten

00:34:17.631 --> 00:34:20.684
what pH is, you can go back to
Chapter 2 which is posted and

00:34:20.684 --> 00:34:23.943
you can read about pH and I try
to take you through sort of what

00:34:23.943 --> 00:34:26.738
you need to know in order to
understand the rest of the

00:34:26.738 --> 00:34:29.475
course material.
And if you've forgotten about

00:34:29.475 --> 00:34:31.589
proteins and what their
structure is like,

00:34:31.589 --> 00:34:34.529
you can go to Chapter 4 and
read sort of a brief review of

00:34:34.529 --> 00:34:37.844
protein biochemistry.
In the section this week,

00:34:37.844 --> 00:34:41.452
I'll talk about the section
meetings in just a moment,

00:34:41.452 --> 00:34:45.059
but there's no required section
meeting this week.

00:34:45.059 --> 00:34:48.116
During the section times I'll
be available if you feel like

00:34:48.116 --> 00:34:50.962
you want to read Chapters 2 and
4 and then come and ask

00:34:50.962 --> 00:34:53.227
questions,
sort of a tutorial on these

00:34:53.227 --> 00:34:55.263
topics of chemistry and
biochemistry,

00:34:55.263 --> 00:34:58.769
then I'll be available to talk
about that during that time.

00:34:58.769 --> 00:35:01.739
We'll start with Week 2 talking
about Genetic Engineering;

00:35:01.739 --> 00:35:05.465
what's DNA, how can it be
manipulated, how is our ability

00:35:05.465 --> 00:35:09.589
to manipulate DNA led to things
like gene therapy which can now

00:35:09.589 --> 00:35:12.383
be in people.
And we'll talk about that and

00:35:12.383 --> 00:35:15.530
that's what Chapter 3 is about.
We'll talk about cell culture

00:35:15.530 --> 00:35:17.971
engineering during Week 4,
how do you maintain cells in

00:35:17.971 --> 00:35:19.780
culture, what are the limits of
this.

00:35:19.780 --> 00:35:22.028
How can you use cultured cells
to do things,

00:35:22.028 --> 00:35:25.218
and how do engineers build new
things out of cultured cells is

00:35:25.218 --> 00:35:28.408
going to be a subject we talk
about throughout the rest of the

00:35:28.408 --> 00:35:30.710
course and the chapter is listed
here.

00:35:30.710 --> 00:35:33.570
So I think that's enough,
you can follow along with the

00:35:33.570 --> 00:35:36.590
syllabus and see sort of what
the topics are each week,

00:35:36.590 --> 00:35:39.462
what the reading assignment is
to do before the lecture in

00:35:39.462 --> 00:35:41.630
order to get the most out of the
lecture.

00:35:41.630 --> 00:35:44.167
Now, each week we have a
section meeting,

00:35:44.167 --> 00:35:46.878
required section,
they're all - all the sections

00:35:46.878 --> 00:35:50.281
meet on Thursday afternoon and
the idea of the section is to

00:35:50.281 --> 00:35:54.030
amplify on some subject we've
talked about during the week.

00:35:54.030 --> 00:35:57.111
We do this in the undergraduate
Biomedical Engineering

00:35:57.111 --> 00:36:00.018
laboratory in the Malone
Building so that we can do

00:36:00.018 --> 00:36:03.448
demonstrations and sort of hands
on projects to really get a

00:36:03.448 --> 00:36:07.170
little bit deeper into the
subject that we're considering.

00:36:07.170 --> 00:36:10.753
So in the first week we run a
section called from strawberries

00:36:10.753 --> 00:36:13.219
to gene therapy where we talk
about DNA,

00:36:13.219 --> 00:36:16.315
extract DNA,
you can play with the DNA of an

00:36:16.315 --> 00:36:20.274
organism and we can think about
how to use DNA for other

00:36:20.274 --> 00:36:22.627
purposes.
In Week 3 you'll actually

00:36:22.627 --> 00:36:25.461
do some cell culture in the
laboratory and look at cultured

00:36:25.461 --> 00:36:27.269
cells and learn how to
manipulate,

00:36:27.269 --> 00:36:30.175
do some manipulations on cells
and culture, and so on

00:36:30.175 --> 00:36:33.127
throughout the weeks.
We have a one hour section

00:36:33.127 --> 00:36:36.909
that's designed to give you some
more detailed experience,

00:36:36.909 --> 00:36:40.074
some hands on experience with
some of the topics we're talking

00:36:40.074 --> 00:36:42.794
about.
There are no lab reports that

00:36:42.794 --> 00:36:44.805
are due.
There sometimes will be

00:36:44.805 --> 00:36:48.074
homework assignments which sort
of build on what we've done

00:36:48.074 --> 00:36:51.567
during the section but it's not
a lab in that sense that it's a

00:36:51.567 --> 00:36:55.004
long experience in the afternoon
or that requires any detailed

00:36:55.004 --> 00:36:57.488
reports.
But it is required and I think

00:36:57.488 --> 00:37:01.520
an important part of the course.
There's a mid-term exam halfway

00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:05.836
through and a final exam at the
end, and there's a term paper

00:37:05.836 --> 00:37:08.929
which is due near the end of the
course.

00:37:08.929 --> 00:37:11.631
So this just - just saying
a little bit more about the

00:37:11.631 --> 00:37:13.289
sections, there's three
sections,

00:37:13.289 --> 00:37:16.424
we have online discussion
section sign up,

00:37:16.424 --> 00:37:19.099
has anybody tried to do that
yet?

00:37:19.099 --> 00:37:20.619
Just so they know that it's
available?

00:37:20.619 --> 00:37:22.767
So it was supposed to be
available from day one,

00:37:22.767 --> 00:37:25.554
you can sign up for a section
that fits your schedule and this

00:37:25.554 --> 00:37:28.159
is sort of the list of things
that we'll go through in the

00:37:28.159 --> 00:37:31.770
section meetings.
Grading - 30% of the grade

00:37:31.770 --> 00:37:35.013
is for the mid-term,
30% for the final,

00:37:35.013 --> 00:37:38.000
and the final is not
cumulative,

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:41.398
the final covers only things
for the last half of the course,

00:37:41.398 --> 00:37:44.740
so it's really just like a -
covers half the course but it's

00:37:44.740 --> 00:37:46.949
given during the final exam
period.

00:37:46.949 --> 00:37:50.031
There's a term paper which I'll
talk more about as the weeks go

00:37:50.031 --> 00:37:52.019
on that's also worth 30% of the
grade.

00:37:52.019 --> 00:37:55.405
You'll have weekly -
approximately weekly homework

00:37:55.405 --> 00:37:58.789
assignments that account for 10%
of your grade,

00:37:58.789 --> 00:38:01.445
but they have an impact beyond
the 10% because if you can do

00:38:01.445 --> 00:38:03.559
the homework and you understand
the homework,

00:38:03.559 --> 00:38:05.920
you're going to have no problem
with the exams.

00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:10.397
I encourage you to spend more
time than the weighting would

00:38:10.397 --> 00:38:13.765
suggest.
So how do you get an "A" in

00:38:13.765 --> 00:38:16.420
the course?
It's very simple.

00:38:16.420 --> 00:38:20.354
You do the reading before
class, you come to class,

00:38:20.354 --> 00:38:24.020
and you do the homework.
And I guarantee you if you do

00:38:24.020 --> 00:38:27.318
those three things throughout
the course that you'll do well

00:38:27.318 --> 00:38:30.895
in the course and I've said this
almost every time I've given the

00:38:30.895 --> 00:38:33.969
course and nobody has ever told
me that I'm wrong.

00:38:33.969 --> 00:38:37.251
And so do these three things,
if you don't get an "A" than

00:38:37.251 --> 00:38:40.130
you can come back and talk to me
about it later.

00:38:40.130 --> 00:38:43.695
The assignment for the next
class is to do Problem 2 of

00:38:43.695 --> 00:38:46.599
Chapter 1, which I've repeated
right here,

00:38:46.599 --> 00:38:49.903
and that's to think beyond what
I've talked about in terms of

00:38:49.903 --> 00:38:53.185
what is Biomedical Engineering.
To think a little bit more

00:38:53.185 --> 00:38:56.568
about Biomedical Engineering
products that you've encountered

00:38:56.568 --> 00:38:58.828
in your life,
or that you have some

00:38:58.828 --> 00:39:01.739
experience with,
and then to think beyond what

00:39:01.739 --> 00:39:05.556
information I've given you in
the chapter or in this lecture

00:39:05.556 --> 00:39:08.921
to say what products of
biomedical engineering do you

00:39:08.921 --> 00:39:12.349
expect to become routine in the
next 50 years.

00:39:12.349 --> 00:39:16.905
So spend ten or 15 minutes
thinking about this and write it

00:39:16.905 --> 00:39:21.617
down and bring your responses to
class in the next period and

00:39:21.617 --> 00:39:26.139
we'll talk about that.
So at the end of this first

00:39:26.139 --> 00:39:30.780
lecture where I've gone some way
in trying to tell you what

00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:35.730
Biomedical Engineering is about,
I thought I would try to relate

00:39:35.730 --> 00:39:40.064
it in a different sort of way.
And you've heard this poem,

00:39:40.064 --> 00:39:44.920
London Bridge is Falling Down,
everybody's heard this poem?

00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:47.413
You played the game;
I don't know if there's a

00:39:47.413 --> 00:39:49.638
videogame now,
if people play games like this

00:39:49.638 --> 00:39:51.610
where London Bridge is Falling
Down.

00:39:51.610 --> 00:39:54.007
This is a picture of London
Bridge, it's an interesting

00:39:54.007 --> 00:39:56.360
bridge which is important in the
history of London.

00:39:56.360 --> 00:40:00.395
Bridges have really changed our
society and allowed us to get

00:40:00.395 --> 00:40:04.026
from one place to another in
ways that we couldn't have

00:40:04.026 --> 00:40:07.334
gotten to easily before.
One of the interesting things

00:40:07.334 --> 00:40:10.083
about London Bridge is that it's
now no longer in London,

00:40:10.083 --> 00:40:12.489
it's in Arizona,
you can see a palm tree here.

00:40:12.489 --> 00:40:15.469
When they reconstructed London
Bridge they moved the old London

00:40:15.469 --> 00:40:19.039
Bridge to Arizona;
some guy bought it.

00:40:19.039 --> 00:40:22.950
That must be an interesting
story, but I just have it here,

00:40:22.950 --> 00:40:26.995
and I think the poem tells you
something about engineering if

00:40:26.995 --> 00:40:30.838
you go through it - and the
problems of engineering.In

00:40:30.838 --> 00:40:34.613
bridge building we're well
advanced in understanding what

00:40:34.613 --> 00:40:38.658
are the problems with building
bridges and how do we overcome

00:40:38.658 --> 00:40:40.288
them?
For example,

00:40:40.288 --> 00:40:43.381
one thing that could happen is
that you build it up with wood

00:40:43.381 --> 00:40:46.197
and clay,
you pick the wrong material for

00:40:46.197 --> 00:40:50.449
a bridge, and it will not stand
up to the forces of nature.

00:40:50.449 --> 00:40:53.728
It will wash away and so you
got to pick the right materials

00:40:53.728 --> 00:40:56.946
in order to build a bridge.
So you pick a better material

00:40:56.946 --> 00:40:59.659
like iron and steel,
that makes a better bridge,

00:40:59.659 --> 00:41:02.644
we know that now because we
have experience with bridges,

00:41:02.644 --> 00:41:04.510
but still your bridge might
fail.

00:41:04.510 --> 00:41:06.190
It might fail for a different
reason.

00:41:06.190 --> 00:41:09.502
It might bend and bow,
that is it's not the forces of

00:41:09.502 --> 00:41:13.516
nature like the movement of the
river that's knocking the bridge

00:41:13.516 --> 00:41:15.659
down,
but it's just the failure of

00:41:15.659 --> 00:41:18.855
these materials over time,
that they don't last as long as

00:41:18.855 --> 00:41:21.543
they might.
So you build it with a material

00:41:21.543 --> 00:41:24.430
like silver and gold,
and then you encounter the

00:41:24.430 --> 00:41:28.115
problems of society that your
bridge might get stolen because

00:41:28.115 --> 00:41:31.616
somebody thinks they have a
better use for silver and gold

00:41:31.616 --> 00:41:34.411
than your bridge.
I would say that in

00:41:34.411 --> 00:41:37.283
Biomedical Engineering,
largely, we're still at the

00:41:37.283 --> 00:41:40.558
stage where we're trying to
understand how things work and

00:41:40.558 --> 00:41:42.847
how they fail,
and what materials are the

00:41:42.847 --> 00:41:44.860
right ones.
We're maybe where civil

00:41:44.860 --> 00:41:48.099
engineering and bridge building
was 100 years ago.

00:41:48.099 --> 00:41:51.685
And that makes it for me a very
exciting time to study this

00:41:51.685 --> 00:41:55.147
because the problems aren't
solved in the way that bridge

00:41:55.147 --> 00:41:57.929
building is largely a solved
problem now.

00:41:57.929 --> 00:42:00.955
Problems like the artificial
heart are still unsolved,

00:42:00.955 --> 00:42:03.010
there's still room for
innovation,

00:42:03.010 --> 00:42:05.755
still room to learn from what
hasn't worked before,

00:42:05.755 --> 00:42:08.829
to learn from science,
and to design something better.

00:42:08.829 --> 00:42:11.586
So one of my purposes of this
course is to get you,

00:42:11.586 --> 00:42:14.949
whether you study Biomedical
Engineering after this or not,

00:42:14.949 --> 00:42:18.988
excited about the subject so
that you start thinking about

00:42:18.988 --> 00:42:23.309
how you could innovate in this
area where lots of problems are

00:42:23.309 --> 00:42:27.515
still left to solve,
so I'll see you on Thursday

00:42:27.515 --> 00:42:28.515
hopefully.

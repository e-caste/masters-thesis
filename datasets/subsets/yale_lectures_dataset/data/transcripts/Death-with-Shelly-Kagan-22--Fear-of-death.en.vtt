00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:03.776
Professor Shelly Kagan:
Last time, I distinguished

00:00:03.776 --> 00:00:06.523
between two ways in which
thinking about the facts about

00:00:06.523 --> 00:00:09.170
the nature of death could
influence our behavior.

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:12.491
On the one hand,
it could give us reasons to

00:00:12.491 --> 00:00:17.125
behave or respond differently,
and on the other hand it could

00:00:17.125 --> 00:00:20.370
merely cause us to behave
differently.

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:23.820
Insofar as it just happens to
be some fact about human

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.010
psychology that we behave this
way or that way,

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:30.687
perhaps the appropriate way to
deal with the facts of death

00:00:30.687 --> 00:00:32.970
would be to simply disregard
them.

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.634
I'm inclined to believe,
however, that there are ways in

00:00:36.634 --> 00:00:40.498
which thinking about the facts
would not merely cause us to

00:00:40.498 --> 00:00:43.496
behave one way rather than
another but give us

00:00:43.496 --> 00:00:47.360
reason to behave one way
rather than another.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.594
And that's the question that I
want to then explore from here

00:00:50.594 --> 00:00:52.640
on out.
In what circumstances,

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.974
or in what ways,
should we behave one way rather

00:00:55.974 --> 00:00:59.145
than another?
So, I'm not merely going to

00:00:59.145 --> 00:01:02.009
draw on facts about how,
as it happens,

00:01:02.009 --> 00:01:05.316
we behave.
It could be that if you dwelled

00:01:05.316 --> 00:01:09.518
upon the facts about death,
you would scream interminably

00:01:09.518 --> 00:01:13.719
until the moment you
died--taking a tip from Tolstoy.

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:16.104
But that doesn't itself show
that that's an appropriate

00:01:16.104 --> 00:01:18.210
response;
that might just be a mere

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.480
causal fact about how we're
built.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.347
The question I want to ask is,
how is it appropriate,

00:01:24.347 --> 00:01:28.587
in what ways is there reason,
to react one way rather than

00:01:28.587 --> 00:01:30.204
another?
Now as I say,

00:01:30.204 --> 00:01:33.104
the thought seems very
compelling for most of us that

00:01:33.104 --> 00:01:36.617
there are ways in which it makes
sense for the facts about death

00:01:36.617 --> 00:01:39.750
to influence how we live,
what our attitudes are,

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.738
what are emotions are.
Kafka, for example,

00:01:42.738 --> 00:01:46.840
said the meaning of life is the
fact that it ends.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.300
Nice little cryptic saying,
as is typical of Kafka.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.628
But the suggestion,
I suppose, is a fairly common

00:01:54.628 --> 00:01:58.580
one, that it's something deep
about how we should live,

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.876
that we're going to die,
that our life will come to an

00:02:01.876 --> 00:02:03.821
end.
And the question we want to

00:02:03.821 --> 00:02:07.430
then explore is how should the
fact, how should recognizing the

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.689
fact, that we're going to die,
influence how we live?

00:02:10.689 --> 00:02:14.849
How should we respond to that
fact?

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:17.227
Now actually,
the very first kind of

00:02:17.227 --> 00:02:20.623
behavior, quote/unquote
behavior, that I want us to

00:02:20.623 --> 00:02:24.155
think about perhaps isn't
strictly speaking a form of

00:02:24.155 --> 00:02:27.525
behavior at all.
I rather have in mind our

00:02:27.525 --> 00:02:31.202
emotional response,
because indeed one of the most

00:02:31.202 --> 00:02:35.254
common reactions to death,
I suppose, is fear of

00:02:35.254 --> 00:02:38.471
death.
Indeed, fear may in many cases

00:02:38.471 --> 00:02:43.413
be too weak a term--an extremely
strong form of fear--terror of

00:02:43.413 --> 00:02:46.706
death is,
I suppose, a very common

00:02:46.706 --> 00:02:52.601
emotional response to death.
And what I want to do next is

00:02:52.601 --> 00:02:58.213
have us ask ourselves,
well, is fear of death a

00:02:58.213 --> 00:03:04.088
rationally appropriate response?
Now, the crucial word here is

00:03:04.088 --> 00:03:07.565
"appropriate."
I don't want to deny at all

00:03:07.565 --> 00:03:13.062
what I take to be the empirical
fact that many people are afraid

00:03:13.062 --> 00:03:15.905
of death.
How common a reaction that is,

00:03:15.905 --> 00:03:18.898
and how strong the fear is,
I suppose that would be

00:03:18.898 --> 00:03:22.250
something for psychologists or
sociologists to study.

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:23.509
And I'm not interested in that
question.

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:25.849
I take it that fear of death is
very common.

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:28.340
I want to know,
is fear of death an

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.490
appropriate, a reasonable
emotion?

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:37.132
Now, in raising that question,
I'm obviously presupposing the

00:03:37.132 --> 00:03:42.774
larger philosophical thesis that
it makes sense to talk about

00:03:42.774 --> 00:03:47.569
emotions as being appropriate or
inappropriate.

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:52.783
We can ask not only what
emotions does somebody have,

00:03:52.783 --> 00:03:57.897
but we can also ask what
emotions should they

00:03:57.897 --> 00:04:00.653
have?
Now, this point perhaps isn't

00:04:00.653 --> 00:04:03.593
an obvious one,
so maybe it's worth dwelling on

00:04:03.593 --> 00:04:06.853
for a moment or two,
before we turn to fear of death

00:04:06.853 --> 00:04:09.013
per se.
What's another example of an

00:04:09.013 --> 00:04:11.599
emotion that's got some
appropriateness conditions?

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:14.515
So, in a moment I'll turn to
asking, what are the conditions

00:04:14.515 --> 00:04:17.578
under which it's appropriate to
be afraid of something?--but to

00:04:17.578 --> 00:04:20.520
make the more general point,
look, take something like pride;

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:24.788
pride's an emotion.
Under what conditions does it

00:04:24.788 --> 00:04:28.269
make sense to be proud of
something?

00:04:28.269 --> 00:04:30.439
Well, I suppose at least two
conditions jump out.

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:33.755
First of all,
the thing that you're proud of

00:04:33.755 --> 00:04:36.839
has to be some kind of
accomplishment.

00:04:36.839 --> 00:04:40.572
If you were to say to me right
now, "I'm really proud of the

00:04:40.572 --> 00:04:43.622
fact that I'm breathing,"
I'd look at you in a

00:04:43.622 --> 00:04:47.516
noncomprehending fashion because
it doesn't seem to me that

00:04:47.516 --> 00:04:50.000
breathing is difficult in any
way,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.431
doesn't count as an
accomplishment,

00:04:52.431 --> 00:04:56.866
and as such I can't understand
how or why you would be proud of

00:04:56.866 --> 00:05:01.309
the fact that you're breathing.
Now, maybe if you suffered from

00:05:01.309 --> 00:05:05.064
asthma and you had to have gone
through excruciating physical

00:05:05.064 --> 00:05:08.630
therapy in order to learn how to
use your lungs after some

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:12.179
accident or something;
maybe if we told a story like

00:05:12.179 --> 00:05:16.155
that we could see how breathing
naturally and normally would be

00:05:16.155 --> 00:05:19.170
an accomplishment,
something to be proud of.

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:21.471
But for all of us,
I presume, it's not an

00:05:21.471 --> 00:05:25.247
accomplishment;
hence it's not something that

00:05:25.247 --> 00:05:29.383
it's appropriate to be proud of.
Even if we've got an

00:05:29.383 --> 00:05:31.290
accomplishment,
that may not be enough.

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:36.165
For something to be something
that it makes sense for you to

00:05:36.165 --> 00:05:39.801
be proud of it,
it's got to be in some way an

00:05:39.801 --> 00:05:43.519
accomplishment that reflects
well on you.

00:05:43.519 --> 00:05:46.400
Now, the most straightforward
cases are cases where it's

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:50.043
your accomplishment,
and the reason that pride makes

00:05:50.043 --> 00:05:54.290
sense is because you're the one
who did this difficult thing.

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:56.970
So, you got an A on your
philosophy paper and you tell me

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:58.980
that you're proud and I
understand that;

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:01.757
getting an A on a philosophy
paper is an accomplishment,

00:06:01.757 --> 00:06:04.990
and if you wrote the paper then
I understand why you're proud.

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:09.871
Of course, if what you did was
go on the Internet and go to one

00:06:09.871 --> 00:06:14.438
of those sites where you pay
money and somebody else writes

00:06:14.438 --> 00:06:17.989
an A paper for you,
well, I understand why maybe

00:06:17.989 --> 00:06:21.407
they should be proud that
they've written a great

00:06:21.407 --> 00:06:24.581
philosophy paper,
but I don't see how this

00:06:24.581 --> 00:06:27.879
reflects especially positively
upon you.

00:06:27.879 --> 00:06:32.461
So again, there's a kind of
appropriateness condition for

00:06:32.461 --> 00:06:37.043
pride, where the object or the
event or the activity that

00:06:37.043 --> 00:06:39.733
you're proud of,
or the feature,

00:06:39.733 --> 00:06:43.612
has to somehow reflect on you.
Now, that's not to say that

00:06:43.612 --> 00:06:46.197
it's got to be your
accomplishment,

00:06:46.197 --> 00:06:48.404
at least not in any
straightforward,

00:06:48.404 --> 00:06:50.392
narrow sense.
It makes sense,

00:06:50.392 --> 00:06:52.778
for example,
to be proud of your children's

00:06:52.778 --> 00:06:56.131
accomplishments because there's
the right kind of connection

00:06:56.131 --> 00:06:59.660
between you and your children.
So, in some sense it's

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:02.672
connected to you.
And we can have cases where we

00:07:02.672 --> 00:07:06.177
wonder about whether or not the
connection is tight enough or

00:07:06.177 --> 00:07:09.389
what exactly the nature of the
connection has to be.

00:07:09.389 --> 00:07:14.806
Perhaps as an American you took
pride when the Americans win

00:07:14.806 --> 00:07:20.315
some event at the Olympics or
the Tour de France or what have

00:07:20.315 --> 00:07:22.278
you,
and you say to yourself,

00:07:22.278 --> 00:07:25.351
"well look, I didn't ride the
bicycle but for all that I'm an

00:07:25.351 --> 00:07:27.910
American and an American won,
I'm proud."

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:31.413
And that makes sense;
we can understand how you think

00:07:31.413 --> 00:07:33.110
the connection there is tight
enough.

00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:37.493
On the other hand if you say,
"look, the Germans won the

00:07:37.493 --> 00:07:41.160
event in the Olympics and I'm
really proud,"

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:43.572
and I ask, well,
are you yourself German,

00:07:43.572 --> 00:07:46.769
do you have German heritage,
did you contribute to the

00:07:46.769 --> 00:07:49.929
German Olympics support team?
If none of that's true,

00:07:49.929 --> 00:07:52.878
then again the appropriateness
condition doesn't seem to be

00:07:52.878 --> 00:07:55.399
satisfied.
It doesn't make sense to

00:07:55.399 --> 00:07:57.067
be proud.
All right, look,

00:07:57.067 --> 00:08:00.604
we could spend more time
worrying about the conditions

00:08:00.604 --> 00:08:03.540
under which it makes sense to
feel pride.

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:05.600
But of course that's not really
my purpose here.

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:09.559
My purpose of bringing that in
was just to try to make good on

00:08:09.559 --> 00:08:12.740
the thought that emotions do
have requirements;

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:16.744
not necessarily requirements
for what you have to have in

00:08:16.744 --> 00:08:19.889
place in order to feel
the emotion.

00:08:19.889 --> 00:08:22.611
It's a harder question whether
all these things need to be in

00:08:22.611 --> 00:08:24.290
place in order to feel the
emotion.

00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:27.581
But at least these things need
to be in place in order for it

00:08:27.581 --> 00:08:30.379
to make sense for you to
have the emotion,

00:08:30.379 --> 00:08:33.889
in order for it to be rational
or reasonable to feel the

00:08:33.889 --> 00:08:37.271
emotion, in order for that
emotional response to be an

00:08:37.271 --> 00:08:41.100
appropriate response to your
circumstances or situation.

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:44.397
So, let's ask ourselves,
then, what are the

00:08:44.397 --> 00:08:47.379
appropriateness conditions for
fear?

00:08:47.379 --> 00:08:50.894
Because armed with that set of
conditions, we'll then be able

00:08:50.894 --> 00:08:53.648
to go on and ask,
is it appropriate to feel fear

00:08:53.648 --> 00:08:55.674
of death?
Now, three conditions come to

00:08:55.674 --> 00:08:58.072
mind when I think about this
question, when I've thought

00:08:58.072 --> 00:08:59.730
about this question over the
years.

00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:01.961
The first is this--and I
suppose this first one's going

00:09:01.961 --> 00:09:04.150
to be fairly uncontroversial--in
order to be afraid of

00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:06.009
something--even though I slipped
in this,

00:09:06.009 --> 00:09:09.568
to talk about what you need to
have in order to feel

00:09:09.568 --> 00:09:12.636
fear, what I really mean is in
order for it to make

00:09:12.636 --> 00:09:16.378
sense to feel fear--the
thing that you're afraid of has

00:09:16.378 --> 00:09:19.755
to be bad.
If somebody were to say to me,

00:09:19.755 --> 00:09:23.555
"I'm afraid that after class
somebody's going to give me an

00:09:23.555 --> 00:09:26.613
ice cream cone",
again I'd look at them in

00:09:26.613 --> 00:09:29.947
noncomprehension.
I'd say, "Why are you afraid of

00:09:29.947 --> 00:09:32.247
that?
How could it make any sense to

00:09:32.247 --> 00:09:34.539
be afraid?"
And again, it's not that

00:09:34.539 --> 00:09:36.960
somebody couldn't give you an
answer.

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:39.948
They'd say, "Oh I'm trying to
lose weight but I'm so weak and

00:09:39.948 --> 00:09:42.837
if they give me an ice cream
cone then I'll just eat it and

00:09:42.837 --> 00:09:44.780
that'll ruin my diet for the
week,"

00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:47.572
well, then I'd understand.
From that point of view an ice

00:09:47.572 --> 00:09:51.397
cream cone is a bad thing and so
that first condition on fear

00:09:51.397 --> 00:09:54.178
would be satisfied.
But if you don't have a story

00:09:54.178 --> 00:09:56.840
like that, if you're like most
of us, most of the time,

00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:59.398
and an ice cream cone's a
pretty good thing,

00:09:59.398 --> 00:10:02.789
a source of some passing but at
least genuine pleasure,

00:10:02.789 --> 00:10:05.803
then you say,
"How can you be afraid of

00:10:05.803 --> 00:10:09.690
having or getting or eating an
ice cream cone?"

00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:13.252
It doesn't make sense.
To be afraid of something,

00:10:13.252 --> 00:10:17.967
it's got to be bad.
It's one of the reasons why we

00:10:17.967 --> 00:10:23.094
sometimes look askance at people
who have various kinds of

00:10:23.094 --> 00:10:28.580
phobias--fear of spiders or fear
of dust or what have you,

00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:32.410
fear of bunnies--and you think,
how does this make any sense?

00:10:32.410 --> 00:10:35.539
It's this cute little bunny;
it's not dangerous.

00:10:35.539 --> 00:10:39.550
And maybe there are poisonous
spiders, but most of the spiders

00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:43.100
we run across here in
Connecticut are not poisonous.

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:45.590
Fear of spiders doesn't seem
appropriate.

00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:48.747
It's not that people can't
have this kind of

00:10:48.747 --> 00:10:51.526
emotional reaction,
it's that it doesn't make

00:10:51.526 --> 00:10:54.139
sense.
Maybe it's another matter if

00:10:54.139 --> 00:10:57.000
you live in Australia,
where there's poisonous snakes

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.419
and spiders and other insects
everyplace.

00:10:59.419 --> 00:11:02.566
All right.
So, condition number one:

00:11:02.566 --> 00:11:07.779
Fear requires something bad,
as the object of your fear.

00:11:07.779 --> 00:11:13.240
I can fear getting a migraine,
if I'm subject to migraines.

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:18.519
I can't fear the pleasure of
looking at a beautiful sunset.

00:11:18.519 --> 00:11:20.615
That's condition number
one--bad object,

00:11:20.615 --> 00:11:24.608
something harmful.
Condition number two is,

00:11:24.608 --> 00:11:30.688
there's got to be a
nonnegligible chance of the bad

00:11:30.688 --> 00:11:37.255
state of affairs happening,
of the bad object coming to

00:11:37.255 --> 00:11:40.710
you.
It's not enough that it's a

00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:45.779
logical possibility for fear to
be a reasonable reaction.

00:11:45.779 --> 00:11:49.401
There's nothing logically
inconsistent or logically

00:11:49.401 --> 00:11:53.747
incoherent about the possibility
that I will face my death by

00:11:53.747 --> 00:11:57.080
being ripped to pieces by
Siberian tigers.

00:11:57.080 --> 00:12:03.610
It's not as though that's an
inconsistent state of affairs.

00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:09.956
It's certainly logically
possible, but it's so unlikely,

00:12:09.956 --> 00:12:14.110
it's so negligibly small a
chance,

00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:19.397
that if anybody here is afraid
that they'll be ripped to pieces

00:12:19.397 --> 00:12:24.940
by tigers, then I can only say
the fear doesn't make any sense,

00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:27.220
it's not appropriate.
Again, we can tell special

00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:29.019
stories where that might be
different.

00:12:29.019 --> 00:12:31.865
Suppose you tell me that,
oh, when you're not a student,

00:12:31.865 --> 00:12:34.336
your work study program,
what you do is,

00:12:34.336 --> 00:12:38.766
you work as an animal trainer,
or you're planning to work in

00:12:38.766 --> 00:12:42.220
the circus where you'll be
training tigers,

00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:44.029
then I'll say,
all right, now I suppose

00:12:44.029 --> 00:12:46.886
there's a nonnegligible chance
you'll be mauled and killed by

00:12:46.886 --> 00:12:48.220
tigers.
I understand it.

00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:53.191
But for the rest of us,
I suppose, the chance of being

00:12:53.191 --> 00:12:57.882
killed by tigers is,
well, it's not literally zero,

00:12:57.882 --> 00:13:02.009
but it's close to zero,
it's negligible.

00:13:02.009 --> 00:13:08.570
And so, fear of being eaten by
tigers or mauled to death by

00:13:08.570 --> 00:13:14.669
tigers doesn't make any sense.
And once you get the point,

00:13:14.669 --> 00:13:20.088
of course, it would be easy to
talk about a variety of other

00:13:20.088 --> 00:13:25.598
things that the chances are so
small--fear of being kidnapped

00:13:25.598 --> 00:13:29.639
by space creatures from Alpha
Centauri,

00:13:29.639 --> 00:13:33.434
where I'll be taken back to the
lab and they'll prod me before

00:13:33.434 --> 00:13:36.110
they dissect me alive without
anesthetic.

00:13:36.110 --> 00:13:38.860
Yes, I suppose there's some
possibility of that.

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:42.899
It's not logically impossible.
But again it's so vanishingly

00:13:42.899 --> 00:13:46.259
small a chance,
and anybody who actually is

00:13:46.259 --> 00:13:50.087
afraid of that,
the appropriate thing for us to

00:13:50.087 --> 00:13:53.399
say is that their fear is not
appropriate.

00:13:53.399 --> 00:13:56.714
All right, so you need to have
a chance of the bad thing,

00:13:56.714 --> 00:13:59.259
and it's got to be a large
enough chance.

00:13:59.259 --> 00:14:03.163
And I suppose again there would
be room for us to argue about

00:14:03.163 --> 00:14:05.570
how large a chance is large
enough,

00:14:05.570 --> 00:14:09.704
but when you have vanishingly
small chances then the fear

00:14:09.704 --> 00:14:13.070
doesn't make any sense.
That's condition number two.

00:14:13.070 --> 00:14:15.867
Condition number three,
I think, is somewhat more

00:14:15.867 --> 00:14:18.490
controversial,
but for all that it still seems

00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:20.529
correct to me,
and that's this.

00:14:20.529 --> 00:14:27.932
We need to have a certain
amount of uncertainty in order

00:14:27.932 --> 00:14:34.619
to have fear be appropriate.
You need to have some--it's not

00:14:34.619 --> 00:14:39.234
clear how much--but at least
some significant amount of

00:14:39.234 --> 00:14:43.850
uncertainty about whether the
bad thing will occur,

00:14:43.850 --> 00:14:49.230
and/or how bad the bad thing
will be.

00:14:49.230 --> 00:14:51.976
To see the point,
to see the relevance of this

00:14:51.976 --> 00:14:54.662
third condition,
imagine that a bad thing was

00:14:54.662 --> 00:14:58.019
going to happen to you with a
nonnegligible chance.

00:14:58.019 --> 00:15:03.264
Indeed, far from being so small
that it's virtually not worth

00:15:03.264 --> 00:15:07.198
even considering,
imagine that it's guaranteed

00:15:07.198 --> 00:15:10.870
that the bad thing is going to
happen.

00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:13.754
So, there's a bad thing that's
going to happen,

00:15:13.754 --> 00:15:16.200
and you know precisely how bad
it is.

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:20.600
So you've got certainty with
regard to the fact that the bad

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:24.552
thing is going to happen,
and certainly with regard to

00:15:24.552 --> 00:15:28.518
the size of the bad thing.
I put it to you that in

00:15:28.518 --> 00:15:32.276
circumstances like that,
fear is not an appropriate

00:15:32.276 --> 00:15:35.972
emotional response.
Suppose that what happens is

00:15:35.972 --> 00:15:38.453
this.
Every day you come to school,

00:15:38.453 --> 00:15:40.496
to the office,
whatever it is,

00:15:40.496 --> 00:15:44.511
and you bring a bagged lunch,
and you put it in the office

00:15:44.511 --> 00:15:46.829
refrigerator.
And you include,

00:15:46.829 --> 00:15:49.060
along with your lunch,
a dessert;

00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:53.319
let's say a cookie.
And every day at one o'clock,

00:15:53.319 --> 00:15:57.713
when you go to grab your lunch
out of the refrigerator,

00:15:57.713 --> 00:16:02.840
you look inside and you see
somebody has stolen your cookie.

00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:05.753
Well, it's a bad thing;
it's not the worst thing in the

00:16:05.753 --> 00:16:08.259
world, but it's a bad thing to
have somebody steal your cookie.

00:16:08.259 --> 00:16:11.446
And furthermore,
this is more than a negligible

00:16:11.446 --> 00:16:13.573
chance.
So, we've got condition one,

00:16:13.573 --> 00:16:16.740
condition two in place--bad
thing and a nonnegligible chance

00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:19.267
of it happening.
In fact, not only is it not a

00:16:19.267 --> 00:16:21.814
negligible chance that it's
happening--guaranteed,

00:16:21.814 --> 00:16:24.310
it happens day after day after
day after day.

00:16:24.310 --> 00:16:28.083
Bad thing, guaranteed.
And you know precisely how bad

00:16:28.083 --> 00:16:30.193
it is.
I put it to you,

00:16:30.193 --> 00:16:34.269
fear in that case doesn't make
any sense.

00:16:34.269 --> 00:16:37.810
Mind you, there are other
negative emotions that probably

00:16:37.810 --> 00:16:40.340
make sense, like anger and
resentment.

00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:42.476
Who does this thief,
whoever it is,

00:16:42.476 --> 00:16:45.870
think that he or she is,
to be stealing your cookie?

00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:47.610
They don't have the right to do
that!

00:16:47.610 --> 00:16:50.820
You can be angry,
you can be resentful.

00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:54.195
You can be sad that you don't
have a dessert,

00:16:54.195 --> 00:16:58.495
day after day after day.
But you can't be afraid,

00:16:58.495 --> 00:17:02.809
because there's nothing here
that it makes sense for you to

00:17:02.809 --> 00:17:06.097
be afraid of.
Again, being a little sloppy,

00:17:06.097 --> 00:17:10.148
maybe you are afraid,
but if so, fear doesn't make

00:17:10.148 --> 00:17:13.071
sense,
when you know for a certainty

00:17:13.071 --> 00:17:16.829
that the bad thing is coming and
how bad it is.

00:17:16.829 --> 00:17:20.535
Suppose that the thief strikes
at random, taking different

00:17:20.535 --> 00:17:24.565
people's desserts from different
bags at different times of the

00:17:24.565 --> 00:17:27.099
week,
and you never know who he or

00:17:27.099 --> 00:17:31.311
she is going to steal from.
Then you might be afraid that

00:17:31.311 --> 00:17:34.900
you'll be the person whose
cookie got stolen.

00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:38.119
Or if cookie seems to you too
silly an example,

00:17:38.119 --> 00:17:42.529
imagine that what happens is
somebody breaks into dorm rooms.

00:17:42.529 --> 00:17:47.722
There's been a thief going
around various dorms on campus

00:17:47.722 --> 00:17:52.080
and stealing the computer from
the dorm room.

00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:56.251
Well there, fear makes sense;
you're afraid that they'll

00:17:56.251 --> 00:17:59.870
steal your computer.
Bad thing, nonnegligible

00:17:59.870 --> 00:18:04.058
chance, and lack of certainty.
On the other hand,

00:18:04.058 --> 00:18:06.451
suppose what happens is,
this is one of those thieves

00:18:06.451 --> 00:18:08.200
like you always have in the
movies,

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:11.818
where he's such a master thief,
or she's such a master thief,

00:18:11.818 --> 00:18:14.050
that they take pride in their
work,

00:18:14.050 --> 00:18:17.549
and so they announce it.
They take out an ad in the

00:18:17.549 --> 00:18:20.910
Yale Daily News and they
say, "On Wednesday,

00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:26.164
April 27^(th),
I shall steal the computer from

00:18:26.164 --> 00:18:30.089
so-and-so's room."
And it doesn't matter what

00:18:30.089 --> 00:18:32.902
precautions you take,
something always happens,

00:18:32.902 --> 00:18:35.470
and that person's computer gets
stolen.

00:18:35.470 --> 00:18:37.362
Well, again,
you could be angry,

00:18:37.362 --> 00:18:39.621
you can be pissed,
you can be annoyed,

00:18:39.621 --> 00:18:42.551
you can feel stupid that you
didn't take adequate

00:18:42.551 --> 00:18:46.170
precautions.
But when the ad appears,

00:18:46.170 --> 00:18:49.217
with your name,
and that date,

00:18:49.217 --> 00:18:54.994
and all year the thief has
always carried through on the

00:18:54.994 --> 00:18:58.598
announced theft,
I put it to you,

00:18:58.598 --> 00:19:03.404
fear doesn't make any sense,
because if you know exactly

00:19:03.404 --> 00:19:07.250
what the size of the harm is
going to be,

00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:11.212
and you're guaranteed that the
harm is coming,

00:19:11.212 --> 00:19:15.698
fear is no longer appropriate.
Suppose that I have a little

00:19:15.698 --> 00:19:18.082
torture machine,
a little pain generator,

00:19:18.082 --> 00:19:21.659
where I put your hand down and
I hook it up to the electrodes

00:19:21.659 --> 00:19:24.520
and I crank the dial and I pull
the switch,

00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:29.494
and you feel an electric shock.
It makes sense to feel fear

00:19:29.494 --> 00:19:34.146
what the next shock is going to
feel like, if the shocks vary in

00:19:34.146 --> 00:19:38.175
their intensity.
But if the machine's only got

00:19:38.175 --> 00:19:43.153
one setting, on and off,
and all the shocks feel exactly

00:19:43.153 --> 00:19:45.084
the same,
and I've done it for you,

00:19:45.084 --> 00:19:46.570
"so look, okay,
let me show you what it feels

00:19:46.570 --> 00:19:48.720
like; it feels like that."
Oh, not comfortable.

00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:50.190
Let me show you what it feels
like, it feels like that;

00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:55.542
over and over, 5,6, 7,8 times;
we're doing some sort of weird

00:19:55.542 --> 00:19:58.455
psychology experiment here.
Well, you know exactly that

00:19:58.455 --> 00:20:01.980
it's coming, you know exactly
what it's going to feel like.

00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:06.119
Fear, I put it to you,
doesn't make any sense.

00:20:06.119 --> 00:20:09.564
Suppose the experiment's over
now, and you think--you've

00:20:09.564 --> 00:20:13.509
gotten your ten dollars and I
refuse to let you go and I say,

00:20:13.509 --> 00:20:20.470
"I'm going to do it one more
time, no worse than before."

00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:23.333
Well, you might not believe me
and that might introduce the

00:20:23.333 --> 00:20:25.900
element of uncertainty and then
perhaps fear would be

00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:28.961
appropriate.
But if you believe me that one

00:20:28.961 --> 00:20:33.430
more pain exactly like the ones
you felt before is coming,

00:20:33.430 --> 00:20:37.345
fear--anger makes sense,
resentment makes sense,

00:20:37.345 --> 00:20:42.010
sadness that you're going to
feel this pain perhaps makes

00:20:42.010 --> 00:20:45.260
sense--but fear doesn't make
sense.

00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:48.077
So, three conditions.
You need to have it's something

00:20:48.077 --> 00:20:50.147
bad.
You need to have on the one

00:20:50.147 --> 00:20:54.389
hand nonnegligible chance that
the bad thing's going to happen,

00:20:54.389 --> 00:20:57.400
and you have to have a lack of
certainty.

00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:00.683
If you've got certainty as to
the nature of the bad and

00:21:00.683 --> 00:21:04.269
certainty that it's coming,
then fear doesn't make sense.

00:21:04.269 --> 00:21:06.602
One of the points probably
worth mentioning in

00:21:06.602 --> 00:21:08.779
passing--even when fear does
make sense,

00:21:08.779 --> 00:21:12.777
there's a kind of
proportionality condition that

00:21:12.777 --> 00:21:18.409
we need to keep in mind as well.
Even if there's a nonnegligible

00:21:18.409 --> 00:21:23.269
chance of the harm coming,
and so fear is appropriate,

00:21:23.269 --> 00:21:27.347
it doesn't make fear
appropriate if it's obsessive

00:21:27.347 --> 00:21:30.759
fear, horrendous fear,
tremendous fear.

00:21:30.759 --> 00:21:36.890
Maybe some mild concern is all
that's appropriate if the

00:21:36.890 --> 00:21:41.245
chances are small.
Similarly, the amount of fear

00:21:41.245 --> 00:21:45.349
needs to be proportioned to the
size of the bad.

00:21:45.349 --> 00:21:48.796
That's perhaps why the cookie
example, you might think a lot

00:21:48.796 --> 00:21:52.068
of fear there's not appropriate
because even if it comes,

00:21:52.068 --> 00:21:55.079
how bad is it?
Loss of a cookie.

00:21:55.079 --> 00:21:58.288
All right, so there are some
conditions that need to be met

00:21:58.288 --> 00:22:00.279
before fear is appropriate at
all,

00:22:00.279 --> 00:22:02.581
and on the other hand even when
fear is appropriate,

00:22:02.581 --> 00:22:07.279
it's still legitimate to ask,
how much fear is appropriate?

00:22:07.279 --> 00:22:13.327
So, armed with all of this,
let's now turn to the question,

00:22:13.327 --> 00:22:18.750
is fear of death appropriate,
and if so, how much?

00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:21.880
And immediately we see we need
to draw some distinctions.

00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:26.415
Well, what are we supposedly
being afraid of when we are

00:22:26.415 --> 00:22:30.423
afraid of death?
And two or perhaps three things

00:22:30.423 --> 00:22:35.759
need to be distinguished.
The first thing you might worry

00:22:35.759 --> 00:22:41.171
about is the process of dying.
Some people find that the

00:22:41.171 --> 00:22:45.992
actual process at the end of
their life is a painful and

00:22:45.992 --> 00:22:49.830
unpleasant one.
Yes, I've given the example of

00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:54.200
being mauled to death by tigers
or eaten alive by tigers.

00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:58.759
Well, I imagine that would be a
pretty unpleasant way to die.

00:22:58.759 --> 00:23:06.484
And so insofar as there is some
nonnegligible chance that you

00:23:06.484 --> 00:23:12.419
will die a painful death,
then I suppose there's some

00:23:12.419 --> 00:23:16.700
room for some--an appropriate
amount--of fear.

00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:19.512
Of course, we then have to ask,
well, what is the chance that

00:23:19.512 --> 00:23:22.096
you'll die painfully?
I've already indicated for

00:23:22.096 --> 00:23:25.283
people in this room I rather
imagine the chance of being

00:23:25.283 --> 00:23:28.180
mauled to death by tigers is
vanishingly small.

00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:32.388
So, I think,
no fear of that form of painful

00:23:32.388 --> 00:23:36.392
death is appropriate.
And for that matter,

00:23:36.392 --> 00:23:40.947
I've got to suggest that I
suspect that fear of dying

00:23:40.947 --> 00:23:46.204
through a painful operation by
the aliens from Alpha Centauri

00:23:46.204 --> 00:23:50.680
is not appropriate either.
Still, the sad fact of the

00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:54.540
matter is that there are people
in the world who do suffer

00:23:54.540 --> 00:23:56.614
painful deaths,
in particular,

00:23:56.614 --> 00:24:00.216
of course, because the number
of diseases that might kill us

00:24:00.216 --> 00:24:03.329
off in their final stages are
sometimes painful.

00:24:03.329 --> 00:24:08.190
Now, one of the interesting
facts is that we could of course

00:24:08.190 --> 00:24:13.134
minimize or eliminate the pain
by giving people adequate pain

00:24:13.134 --> 00:24:16.617
medication.
And so, it comes as a rather

00:24:16.617 --> 00:24:21.112
unpleasant bit of news that most
hospitals do not provide

00:24:21.112 --> 00:24:26.370
adequate pain medication,
in many, many instances,

00:24:26.370 --> 00:24:29.950
at the end of life.
Why?

00:24:29.950 --> 00:24:32.750
That's a whole other
complicated question.

00:24:32.750 --> 00:24:35.534
But I suppose if somebody were
to say to me that--look,

00:24:35.534 --> 00:24:37.975
I read the newspaper,
there are studies done

00:24:37.975 --> 00:24:41.057
periodically about whether or
not there's adequate pain

00:24:41.057 --> 00:24:44.309
medication at the end of life
and the studies suggest,

00:24:44.309 --> 00:24:46.849
year after year,
that no, we still don't in

00:24:46.849 --> 00:24:49.450
general provide adequate pain
medication.

00:24:49.450 --> 00:24:52.976
If you were to say to me,
"In light of that I've got some

00:24:52.976 --> 00:24:56.880
fear that this may happen to
me," well, I'd understand that.

00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:59.517
Again, if you said to me,
"I can't sleep for fear that

00:24:59.517 --> 00:25:02.271
this is going to happen to me,"
I'd want to say,

00:25:02.271 --> 00:25:06.160
well, that sort of fear strikes
me as disproportionate.

00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:08.866
But at any rate,
I suppose that when people say

00:25:08.866 --> 00:25:12.114
that they're afraid of death,
although some of them,

00:25:12.114 --> 00:25:14.380
in some moments,
might have in mind,

00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:18.589
what they mean is that they're
afraid of the process of dying,

00:25:18.589 --> 00:25:21.589
I take it that that's not
actually the central fear that

00:25:21.589 --> 00:25:26.050
people mean to be expressing.
People mean to suggest that

00:25:26.050 --> 00:25:32.309
they're afraid of death itself,
they're afraid of being

00:25:32.309 --> 00:25:35.187
dead.
And with regard to that,

00:25:35.187 --> 00:25:38.958
I want to suggest,
I don't actually think the

00:25:38.958 --> 00:25:42.130
relevant conditions are
satisfied.

00:25:42.130 --> 00:25:44.079
Look, let's think about what
they were again.

00:25:44.079 --> 00:25:47.049
There was a certain amount of
uncertainty.

00:25:47.049 --> 00:25:50.004
Well, of course,
with regard to being dead

00:25:50.004 --> 00:25:55.108
there's no uncertainty at all.
You're guaranteed that you're

00:25:55.108 --> 00:25:58.605
going to die.
And indeed, condition number

00:25:58.605 --> 00:26:03.201
one, that the bad thing--for
fear to make sense the object of

00:26:03.201 --> 00:26:08.597
my fear has to be a bad thing.
Well, let's ask ourselves,

00:26:08.597 --> 00:26:13.119
is being dead intrinsically a
bad thing?

00:26:13.119 --> 00:26:15.660
It doesn't seem to me that it
is.

00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:20.603
Of course, this all presupposes
the positions about the nature

00:26:20.603 --> 00:26:25.789
of death that I argued for in
the first half of this semester.

00:26:25.789 --> 00:26:28.519
There's nothing mysterious or
unknown about death.

00:26:28.519 --> 00:26:30.279
Look, suppose you thought there
was.

00:26:30.279 --> 00:26:34.115
Suppose you believe in the
afterlife, or at least the

00:26:34.115 --> 00:26:38.171
possibility of an afterlife,
and you're worried that you

00:26:38.171 --> 00:26:42.146
might go to hell.
Well, then fear makes some

00:26:42.146 --> 00:26:44.425
sense.
If there's a possibility,

00:26:44.425 --> 00:26:47.871
nonnegligible in your mind,
that there'll be a painful

00:26:47.871 --> 00:26:51.513
experience after you die--not
guaranteed--if you're a bad

00:26:51.513 --> 00:26:55.609
enough sinner so that you're
certain you're going to hell,

00:26:55.609 --> 00:26:58.859
then again I think condition
number three isn't satisfied.

00:26:58.859 --> 00:27:02.650
But if like most of us you
wouldn't know if you were a bad

00:27:02.650 --> 00:27:05.207
enough sinner or not,
and so there's some

00:27:05.207 --> 00:27:08.400
nonnegligible chance of this bad
thing, without certainly,

00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:10.496
well, somebody like that who
says they're afraid of being

00:27:10.496 --> 00:27:12.630
dead, for fear that they might
find themselves in hell,

00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:19.370
at least I understand that.
But on the physicalist picture

00:27:19.370 --> 00:27:23.955
where death is the end,
where when your body decays

00:27:23.955 --> 00:27:29.844
there's no experience at all,
then it seems to me that the

00:27:29.844 --> 00:27:34.170
first condition on fear isn't
satisfied.

00:27:34.170 --> 00:27:39.267
The badness of death after all,
according to the deprivation

00:27:39.267 --> 00:27:42.809
account, is the mere absence of
a good.

00:27:42.809 --> 00:27:48.582
And it seems to me the mere
absence of a good is not the

00:27:48.582 --> 00:27:52.569
right kind of thing to be afraid
of.

00:27:52.569 --> 00:27:57.319
Suppose I give you an ice cream
cone, and you like it.

00:27:57.319 --> 00:28:00.910
You wish you could have a
second ice cream cone.

00:28:00.910 --> 00:28:05.210
But I don't have a second ice
cream cone to share with you.

00:28:05.210 --> 00:28:09.271
So you know that after the
first ice cream cone is over,

00:28:09.271 --> 00:28:12.299
you won't have a second ice
cream cone.

00:28:12.299 --> 00:28:16.393
That's a pity,
that's a lack of something

00:28:16.393 --> 00:28:18.910
good.
And now you're telling me,

00:28:18.910 --> 00:28:21.814
"I'm afraid;
I'm afraid of the fact that

00:28:21.814 --> 00:28:26.490
there will be this period after
the first ice cream cone is done

00:28:26.490 --> 00:28:30.349
in which I'm not getting a
second ice cream cone.

00:28:30.349 --> 00:28:35.569
I'm afraid because of the
badness of deprivation of ice

00:28:35.569 --> 00:28:37.820
cream."
I say to you,

00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:44.509
deprivations per se are not the
kind of thing to be afraid of;

00:28:44.509 --> 00:28:49.130
they're not bad in the right
kind of way.

00:28:49.130 --> 00:28:55.562
So, if death is bad only or
most centrally insofar as it's a

00:28:55.562 --> 00:29:01.885
deprivation of the good things
in life, there's nothing bad

00:29:01.885 --> 00:29:07.267
there to be afraid of.
Well, that doesn't mean there

00:29:07.267 --> 00:29:10.869
isn't anything here in the
neighborhood.

00:29:10.869 --> 00:29:15.248
After all, we have to worry not
just about the fact that we're

00:29:15.248 --> 00:29:18.119
going to die,
we have to worry about when

00:29:18.119 --> 00:29:23.271
we're going to die.
We might be certain that death

00:29:23.271 --> 00:29:28.290
is going to come,
but we're not certain that

00:29:28.290 --> 00:29:33.308
death is going to come a long
time from now,

00:29:33.308 --> 00:29:38.691
as opposed to soon.
So, perhaps the relevant thing

00:29:38.691 --> 00:29:42.909
to be afraid of is the
possibility that you'll die

00:29:42.909 --> 00:29:45.559
soon.
Consider an analogy.

00:29:45.559 --> 00:29:48.368
Suppose that you're at a party,
it's a great party,

00:29:48.368 --> 00:29:50.839
you wish you could stay and
stay and stay,

00:29:50.839 --> 00:29:53.499
but this is taking place back
in high school,

00:29:53.499 --> 00:29:57.126
and what's going to happen is
your mother is going to call at

00:29:57.126 --> 00:30:00.390
a certain point and tell you
it's time to go home.

00:30:00.390 --> 00:30:03.680
Now, let's just imagine there's
nothing bad about being at home;

00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:07.514
it's neutral.
You just wish you could stay

00:30:07.514 --> 00:30:11.216
but you know you can't.
If you know the call is going

00:30:11.216 --> 00:30:14.565
to come at midnight,
guaranteed, then there's

00:30:14.565 --> 00:30:18.100
nothing to be afraid of.
You might resent the fact that

00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:20.369
your mother is going to call you
at midnight,

00:30:20.369 --> 00:30:23.657
be annoyed at the fact that she
won't let you stay out till one

00:30:23.657 --> 00:30:27.216
o'clock like your other friends,
but there's nothing to be

00:30:27.216 --> 00:30:29.275
afraid of.
There, it's 11 o'clock and

00:30:29.275 --> 00:30:31.501
you're saying,
"I'm terrified of the fact that

00:30:31.501 --> 00:30:33.480
the call's going to come at
midnight;

00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:37.652
I know it's going to come."
See, fear there doesn't make

00:30:37.652 --> 00:30:42.113
sense, because it doesn't have
the relevant degree of

00:30:42.113 --> 00:30:44.946
uncertainty.
You know exactly what's coming

00:30:44.946 --> 00:30:47.370
and you know for a certainty
that it's coming;

00:30:47.370 --> 00:30:50.961
fear isn't appropriate.
Well, suppose instead of what

00:30:50.961 --> 00:30:53.322
happens is a guarantee that your
mother's going to call at

00:30:53.322 --> 00:30:57.109
midnight,
what we've got is your mother's

00:30:57.109 --> 00:31:01.460
going to call sometime between
11 and 1.

00:31:01.460 --> 00:31:07.791
Now, some fear makes sense.
Most of the time she calls

00:31:07.791 --> 00:31:11.547
around 12,12:30;
sometimes she calls at 1 for

00:31:11.547 --> 00:31:15.960
parties;
occasionally she calls at 11.

00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:18.930
You're worried now,
there's a nonnegligible chance

00:31:18.930 --> 00:31:21.597
she'll call at 11 rather than
sometime later,

00:31:21.597 --> 00:31:24.506
12 or 1 o'clock.
There's a bad thing,

00:31:24.506 --> 00:31:29.339
some nonnegligible chance,
and the absence of certainty.

00:31:29.339 --> 00:31:31.650
Now some degree of fear makes
sense.

00:31:31.650 --> 00:31:37.109
And perhaps that's what we've
got with regard to death.

00:31:37.109 --> 00:31:40.304
If so, we might say the crucial
ingredient here,

00:31:40.304 --> 00:31:44.246
by virtue of which death is
something that it's appropriate

00:31:44.246 --> 00:31:48.460
for us to be afraid of is
because of the unpredictability.

00:31:51.910 --> 00:31:55.950
Even if we had variability we
might not have unpredictability.

00:31:55.950 --> 00:31:59.579
That's a point that we touched
upon previously.

00:31:59.579 --> 00:32:03.952
It's the unpredictability that
leaves you in a position of not

00:32:03.952 --> 00:32:08.539
knowing whether death will come
soon, or death will come late.

00:32:08.539 --> 00:32:12.051
Will you die at 20,
will you die at 50,

00:32:12.051 --> 00:32:16.210
will you die at 80,
or will you die at 100?

00:32:16.210 --> 00:32:19.771
It seems to me that if it
weren't for the

00:32:19.771 --> 00:32:24.046
unpredictability,
fear of death wouldn't make any

00:32:24.046 --> 00:32:26.985
sense at all.
Given that we do have

00:32:26.985 --> 00:32:30.108
unpredictability,
some fear of death might make

00:32:30.108 --> 00:32:32.750
sense;
although again it's important

00:32:32.750 --> 00:32:36.950
to be clear about what it is
that it makes sense to be afraid

00:32:36.950 --> 00:32:40.420
of.
It's not being dead per se.

00:32:40.420 --> 00:32:45.002
I remain of the opinion that
being dead per se is not the

00:32:45.002 --> 00:32:48.602
sort of thing it makes sense to
be afraid of,

00:32:48.602 --> 00:32:52.529
once you've concluded that
death is the end.

00:32:52.529 --> 00:32:57.557
The only thing that it might
make some sense to be afraid of

00:32:57.557 --> 00:33:02.670
is that you might die too
soon--earlier rather than later.

00:33:02.670 --> 00:33:08.055
Of course, having noted that
point, we then have to ask,

00:33:08.055 --> 00:33:11.579
well how much fear is
appropriate?

00:33:11.579 --> 00:33:16.740
How great is the chance that
you'll die too soon?

00:33:16.740 --> 00:33:22.400
Your fear needs to be
proportioned to the likelihood.

00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:26.750
How likely is it that you will
die in the next year,

00:33:26.750 --> 00:33:30.247
or five years,
or for that matter 10 or 20

00:33:30.247 --> 00:33:33.710
years?
The fact of the matter is for

00:33:33.710 --> 00:33:39.109
most of you, almost all of you,
the chances are very unlikely

00:33:39.109 --> 00:33:42.702
indeed;
not quite negligible,

00:33:42.702 --> 00:33:46.942
but rather small.
For a healthy 20-year-old,

00:33:46.942 --> 00:33:49.841
for example,
the chances of dying in the

00:33:49.841 --> 00:33:53.259
next five or ten years are
extremely small,

00:33:53.259 --> 00:34:00.024
in which case even if some
slight fear might be called for,

00:34:00.024 --> 00:34:05.740
no significant amount of fear
seems called for.

00:34:05.740 --> 00:34:11.369
So, if somebody were to say to
me, "look, the facts about death

00:34:11.369 --> 00:34:16.000
are so overwhelming that I'm
terrified of death,"

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:20.281
all I can say in response is
not, that I don't believe you,

00:34:20.281 --> 00:34:24.414
but for all that it seems to me
terror of death is not an

00:34:24.414 --> 00:34:29.661
appropriate response.
It doesn't make sense given the

00:34:29.661 --> 00:34:32.211
facts.
Now, having said that,

00:34:32.211 --> 00:34:36.909
that doesn't mean that there
may not be some other emotion,

00:34:36.909 --> 00:34:41.039
some other negative emotion
that is appropriate.

00:34:41.039 --> 00:34:44.045
Fear of death strikes me as,
for the most part,

00:34:44.045 --> 00:34:46.284
overblown;
it's widespread,

00:34:46.284 --> 00:34:50.650
I suppose, but for the most
part inappropriate.

00:34:50.650 --> 00:34:53.877
But that doesn't mean that--As
I suggested before in working

00:34:53.877 --> 00:34:57.269
through some of these examples,
sometimes anger makes sense;

00:34:57.269 --> 00:34:59.480
sometimes resentment makes
sense;

00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:04.059
sorrow, regret,
sadness, that may make sense.

00:35:04.059 --> 00:35:07.735
So, in having argued that for
the most part fear of death does

00:35:07.735 --> 00:35:10.320
not make sense,
I haven't yet given us any

00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:13.679
reason to think that there might
not be other emotions,

00:35:13.679 --> 00:35:17.900
negative emotions,
that do make sense.

00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:21.496
So let's ask.
What about some of those other

00:35:21.496 --> 00:35:22.850
possible emotions?

00:35:28.019 --> 00:35:32.364
What negative emotion,
if any, does it make sense to

00:35:32.364 --> 00:35:36.878
feel about death itself,
the fact that you're going to

00:35:36.878 --> 00:35:38.352
die?
Well, of course,

00:35:38.352 --> 00:35:41.323
look, it's also worth bearing
in mind, since I've argued that

00:35:41.323 --> 00:35:45.295
immortality would be bad,
the fact that you will die is

00:35:45.295 --> 00:35:49.888
not actually bad.
It's good because it saves you

00:35:49.888 --> 00:35:54.671
from the unpleasant aspect of an
eternal, dreary,

00:35:54.671 --> 00:35:59.663
dreadful immortal existence.
Still, we might say,

00:35:59.663 --> 00:36:03.850
most of us, almost all of us,
die too soon.

00:36:03.850 --> 00:36:08.972
So, what about that?
We die before life has yielded

00:36:08.972 --> 00:36:14.650
up all the goods that it could
have given us.

00:36:14.650 --> 00:36:18.739
So what is the appropriate
negative emotional response

00:36:18.739 --> 00:36:21.179
here?
Or is there one?

00:36:21.179 --> 00:36:24.789
I suppose the natural second
suggestion is anger.

00:36:24.789 --> 00:36:28.741
You might say,
look, maybe fear isn't right,

00:36:28.741 --> 00:36:31.590
isn't appropriate,
but anger.

00:36:31.590 --> 00:36:35.284
I'm angry.
I want to shake my fist at the

00:36:35.284 --> 00:36:40.356
universe and curse the universe
for giving me only 50 years or

00:36:40.356 --> 00:36:43.599
70 years or 80 years even 100
years,

00:36:43.599 --> 00:36:49.103
when the world is such a rich,
incredibly fantastic place that

00:36:49.103 --> 00:36:54.877
it would take thousands of years
or longer to exhaust what it has

00:36:54.877 --> 00:36:59.590
to offer.
So, isn't anger an appropriate

00:36:59.590 --> 00:37:03.438
response?
And again, I think the answer

00:37:03.438 --> 00:37:08.405
is not so clear that it is,
because, like all the other

00:37:08.405 --> 00:37:13.650
emotions, anger itself has
appropriateness conditions.

00:37:13.650 --> 00:37:19.190
In order for anger to make
sense, well, here's condition

00:37:19.190 --> 00:37:22.981
number one.
It seems to me it's got to be

00:37:22.981 --> 00:37:27.259
directed at a person,
it's got to be directed at an

00:37:27.259 --> 00:37:30.820
agent,
it's got to be directed at some

00:37:30.820 --> 00:37:36.039
thing that had some choice over
what it was doing to you.

00:37:36.039 --> 00:37:40.151
So, when your roommate,
whatever it is,

00:37:40.151 --> 00:37:46.534
spills coffee on your computer,
destroying the hard drive or

00:37:46.534 --> 00:37:50.229
whatever it is,
because they were careless,

00:37:50.229 --> 00:37:53.690
even though you told them
previously to be more careful,

00:37:53.690 --> 00:37:58.134
anger makes sense.
It's directed at your roommate,

00:37:58.134 --> 00:38:01.463
who's a person,
who had some control over what

00:38:01.463 --> 00:38:06.159
they were doing.
Your roommate's an agent.

00:38:06.159 --> 00:38:09.515
If you want to get angry at
me for the grades that

00:38:09.515 --> 00:38:12.931
you receive in this class,
well, at least condition number

00:38:12.931 --> 00:38:16.507
one makes sense;
you're directing your anger at

00:38:16.507 --> 00:38:21.104
an agent, at an individual
person who has some control over

00:38:21.104 --> 00:38:23.719
how I behave,
how they behave.

00:38:23.719 --> 00:38:26.382
Condition number two,
I suppose--this may not be all

00:38:26.382 --> 00:38:28.471
the conditions,
but at least a second one

00:38:28.471 --> 00:38:31.281
is--anger makes sense when,
and only when,

00:38:31.281 --> 00:38:35.960
the agent has wronged you,
has treated you in a way that

00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:40.470
it was morally inappropriate for
them to teat you.

00:38:44.849 --> 00:38:51.050
If your roommate has been doing
things that you don't like,

00:38:51.050 --> 00:38:58.000
but they haven't done anything
wrong, anger doesn't make sense.

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:03.569
When you are angry at them,
you are revealing the fact that

00:39:03.569 --> 00:39:06.929
you think they've mistreated
you.

00:39:06.929 --> 00:39:11.279
Mistreatment requires the
notion of they've behaved toward

00:39:11.279 --> 00:39:14.559
you in a way that morally they
shouldn't.

00:39:14.559 --> 00:39:18.232
All right, these strike me as
two conditions that need to be

00:39:18.232 --> 00:39:21.780
in place in order for anger to
be an appropriate emotional

00:39:21.780 --> 00:39:23.804
response.
Of course, again,

00:39:23.804 --> 00:39:28.164
we no doubt feel anger in other
cases, although typically when

00:39:28.164 --> 00:39:32.595
we're angry at inanimate objects
it's because we've personified

00:39:32.595 --> 00:39:34.615
them.
Your paper is due,

00:39:34.615 --> 00:39:38.748
you're rushing off to class,
you're about to print it out,

00:39:38.748 --> 00:39:42.374
and your computer crashes,
and you get angry at the

00:39:42.374 --> 00:39:45.547
computer.
Well, what's going on there,

00:39:45.547 --> 00:39:49.170
I suppose, is you've
personified the computer.

00:39:49.170 --> 00:39:52.965
You have fallen into the trap,
understandable,

00:39:52.965 --> 00:39:57.182
natural, of viewing the
computer as though it was a

00:39:57.182 --> 00:40:01.990
person who had deliberately
chosen to fail right now,

00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:06.693
letting you down yet again.
And I understand this sort of

00:40:06.693 --> 00:40:09.790
behavior;
I do this sort of thing as well.

00:40:09.790 --> 00:40:13.635
But of course you can step back.
At least, once your anger has

00:40:13.635 --> 00:40:18.491
subsided, you can step back and
say, look, getting angry at your

00:40:18.491 --> 00:40:21.420
computer doesn't really make
sense,

00:40:21.420 --> 00:40:23.920
because your computer is not a
person;

00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:28.385
your computer is not an agent;
your computer didn't have any

00:40:28.385 --> 00:40:29.660
choice or control.

00:40:32.769 --> 00:40:36.303
Suppose that--take those two
conditions and now ask

00:40:36.303 --> 00:40:40.331
ourselves, does it make sense
then to be angry at the fact

00:40:40.331 --> 00:40:44.259
that we're going to die?
And I suppose the answer is

00:40:44.259 --> 00:40:46.713
going to be, well,
look, who is it,

00:40:46.713 --> 00:40:51.190
or what is it that you think is
the cause of our mortality,

00:40:51.190 --> 00:40:54.070
or the fact that we only get
our 50 or 80 years?

00:40:54.070 --> 00:40:58.860
Here's two crude,
basic alternatives.

00:40:58.860 --> 00:41:01.699
You might believe in God,
a kind of classic,

00:41:01.699 --> 00:41:05.330
theistic, conception of God,
according to which God is a

00:41:05.330 --> 00:41:08.500
person who makes decisions about
what to do.

00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:14.800
And God has condemned us to
death.

00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:19.841
That's what happens in Genesis,
God punishes Adam and Eve by

00:41:19.841 --> 00:41:22.792
making them die.
All right, that's picture

00:41:22.792 --> 00:41:26.421
number one.
Picture number two is you just

00:41:26.421 --> 00:41:32.323
think there's this impersonal
universe, atoms swirling in the

00:41:32.323 --> 00:41:35.235
void,
coming together in various

00:41:35.235 --> 00:41:38.588
combinations,
but there's no person behind

00:41:38.588 --> 00:41:42.633
the scene controlling all of it.
Let's consider the two

00:41:42.633 --> 00:41:46.699
possibilities.
Possibility number one, God.

00:41:46.699 --> 00:41:50.971
Well, look, if you've got the
God view, at least we satisfy

00:41:50.971 --> 00:41:54.360
the first of our appropriateness
conditions.

00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:59.219
We can say, look;
we can say, I'm angry at God

00:41:59.219 --> 00:42:03.648
for condemning us to a life
that's short,

00:42:03.648 --> 00:42:09.405
that's so inadequate,
relative to the riches that the

00:42:09.405 --> 00:42:13.510
world offers us.
That's condition number one.

00:42:13.510 --> 00:42:15.519
But what about condition number
two?

00:42:15.519 --> 00:42:20.347
Condition number two,
after all, requires that God

00:42:20.347 --> 00:42:26.160
has mistreated us in giving us
our 50 or 80 or 100 years.

00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:29.559
And is that the case?
Has God wronged us?

00:42:29.559 --> 00:42:34.409
Has God treated us in some way
that isn't morally justified?

00:42:34.409 --> 00:42:37.913
If not, anger at God,
resentment of God,

00:42:37.913 --> 00:42:41.469
wouldn't make sense.
Suppose your roommate comes

00:42:41.469 --> 00:42:45.095
into the suite and has a box of
candy, and he gives you a piece

00:42:45.095 --> 00:42:48.148
of candy, and you enjoy it.
And he gives you a second piece

00:42:48.148 --> 00:42:50.601
of candy and you enjoy it.
And he gives you a third piece

00:42:50.601 --> 00:42:53.785
of candy and you enjoy it.
And you ask for a fourth piece

00:42:53.785 --> 00:42:56.180
of candy, and he won't give it
you.

00:42:56.180 --> 00:43:00.300
Has he wronged you?
Has he treated you immorally?

00:43:00.300 --> 00:43:03.969
Does he owe you more
candy?

00:43:03.969 --> 00:43:07.159
It's not clear that he or she
does.

00:43:07.159 --> 00:43:09.441
But if not, then being
angry--again,

00:43:09.441 --> 00:43:12.569
I would certainly understand it
if you got angry,

00:43:12.569 --> 00:43:15.632
in the sense that it's a
perfectly common enough

00:43:15.632 --> 00:43:17.546
response.
But is anger an

00:43:17.546 --> 00:43:21.166
appropriate response to
your roommate for giving you

00:43:21.166 --> 00:43:23.849
something, and then not giving
you more?

00:43:23.849 --> 00:43:26.166
It's not clear that it
is an appropriate

00:43:26.166 --> 00:43:28.312
response.
The appropriate response

00:43:28.312 --> 00:43:31.231
actually seems to me to be,
not one of anger,

00:43:31.231 --> 00:43:34.322
but gratitude.
Your roommate didn't owe you

00:43:34.322 --> 00:43:37.616
any candy at all,
and they gave you four pieces,

00:43:37.616 --> 00:43:40.630
or whatever it was,
the number just was.

00:43:40.630 --> 00:43:45.866
You might wish you could have
more, you might be sad that you

00:43:45.866 --> 00:43:49.183
can't have more,
but anger doesn't seem

00:43:49.183 --> 00:43:51.572
appropriate.
God doesn't,

00:43:51.572 --> 00:43:55.542
as far as I can see,
owe it to us to give us more

00:43:55.542 --> 00:43:59.541
life than what we get.
Well, suppose we don't believe

00:43:59.541 --> 00:44:02.309
in the God theory but the
universe theory.

00:44:02.309 --> 00:44:04.999
Well then, of course ,even
condition number one isn't

00:44:04.999 --> 00:44:08.452
satisfied.
The universe is not a person,

00:44:08.452 --> 00:44:12.750
is not an agent,
has no choice and control.

00:44:12.750 --> 00:44:16.137
And as such,
again, it just seems to me that

00:44:16.137 --> 00:44:20.550
anger then--I can lift my fist
and curse the universe;

00:44:20.550 --> 00:44:23.780
of course, what I'm doing then
is, I'm personifying the

00:44:23.780 --> 00:44:27.428
universe, treating the universe
as though it was a person that

00:44:27.428 --> 00:44:30.360
deliberately decided to make us
die too soon.

00:44:30.360 --> 00:44:33.261
But however common that
response might be,

00:44:33.261 --> 00:44:37.719
it makes no sense rationally if
the universe is not a person.

00:44:37.719 --> 00:44:42.520
It's just atoms swirling,
forming various kinds of

00:44:42.520 --> 00:44:45.989
combinations.
Anger at the fact that I'm

00:44:45.989 --> 00:44:48.219
going to die,
or die too soon,

00:44:48.219 --> 00:44:53.360
doesn't make sense either.
Well, what about sorrow?

00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:58.771
Maybe I should just be sad at
the fact that I'm going to die

00:44:58.771 --> 00:45:02.801
too soon.
And I think some emotion along

00:45:02.801 --> 00:45:06.989
that line does make sense.
The world's a wonderful place.

00:45:06.989 --> 00:45:10.349
It would be better to have more
of it.

00:45:10.349 --> 00:45:15.809
I'm sad that I don't get more,
that I'm not going to get more.

00:45:15.809 --> 00:45:21.541
But having had that thought,
I immediately find myself with

00:45:21.541 --> 00:45:26.750
another thought.
Although it's a pity I don't

00:45:26.750 --> 00:45:34.469
get more, I'm extremely lucky to
have gotten as much as I get.

00:45:34.469 --> 00:45:37.723
The universe is just this
swirling mass of atoms,

00:45:37.723 --> 00:45:41.789
forming clumps of various kinds
of things, and dissolving.

00:45:41.789 --> 00:45:48.260
Most of those atoms don't get
to be alive at all.

00:45:48.260 --> 00:45:54.351
Most of those atoms don't get
to be a person,

00:45:54.351 --> 00:45:58.642
falling in love,
seeing sunsets,

00:45:58.642 --> 00:46:05.185
eating ice cream.
It's extraordinarily lucky of

00:46:05.185 --> 00:46:10.199
us to be in this select,
fortunate few.

00:46:10.199 --> 00:46:13.579
Let me close then with an
expression of this thought.

00:46:13.579 --> 00:46:18.230
This is from Kurt Vonnegut's
book, Cat's Cradle.

00:46:18.230 --> 00:46:24.116
This is a kind of prayer that
one of the characters in the

00:46:24.116 --> 00:46:29.280
novel says--is supposed to
say--at the deathbed.

00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:34.059
God made mud.
God got lonesome.

00:46:34.059 --> 00:46:38.150
So God said to some of the mud,
"Sit up."

00:46:38.150 --> 00:46:43.804
"See all I've made," said God.
"The hills, the sea,

00:46:43.804 --> 00:46:48.566
the sky, the stars."
And I, with some of the mud,

00:46:48.566 --> 00:46:51.350
had got to sit up and look
around.

00:46:51.350 --> 00:46:56.957
Lucky me, lucky mud.
I, mud, sat up and saw what a

00:46:56.957 --> 00:47:01.139
nice job God had done.
Nice going God!

00:47:01.139 --> 00:47:03.680
Nobody but you could have done
it God!

00:47:03.680 --> 00:47:07.572
I certainly couldn't have.
I feel very unimportant

00:47:07.572 --> 00:47:11.097
compared to You.
The only way I can feel the

00:47:11.097 --> 00:47:15.524
least bit important is to think
of all the mud that didn't even

00:47:15.524 --> 00:47:19.269
get to sit up and look around.
I got so much,

00:47:19.269 --> 00:47:24.110
and most mud got so little.
Thank you for the honor!

00:47:24.110 --> 00:47:28.120
Now mud lies down again and
goes to sleep.

00:47:28.120 --> 00:47:32.830
What memories for mud to have!
What interesting other kinds of

00:47:32.830 --> 00:47:36.326
sitting-up mud I met!
I loved everything I saw

00:47:36.326 --> 00:47:40.388
[Vonnegut 1963].
It seems to me that the right

00:47:40.388 --> 00:47:44.079
emotional response isn't fear,
it isn't anger,

00:47:44.079 --> 00:47:49.000
it's gratitude that
we're able to be alive at all.

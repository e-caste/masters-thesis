00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.982
Prof: Anyhow,
so today I'm going to try and

00:00:04.982 --> 00:00:06.670
wrap up a few loose ends.
 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:12.362
So I'm going to try and talk
about the high water mark of

00:00:12.362 --> 00:00:17.750
finance which is basically CAPM
and Black-Scholes,

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.990
both of which we've almost
talked about,

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.029
almost finished talking about,
and I'm going to talk in the

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:28.930
middle about Social Security
which we never finished,

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:31.480
my Social Security plan.
 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.430
So I hope to deal with all
three of these things today.

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:39.710
So just to wrap up the CAPM,
the CAPM had two main ideas.

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:45.457
The first idea was
diversification and the second

00:00:45.457 --> 00:00:51.563
main idea, as we said,
was the tradeoff between risk

00:00:51.563 --> 00:00:53.360
and return.
 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.440
Shakespeare had both of these
ideas.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.452
He understood that you're safer
if you've got each of your boats

00:00:58.452 --> 00:01:01.152
on a different ocean,
and he understood that if

00:01:01.152 --> 00:01:05.001
you're going to take a high risk
you'd better get a high return

00:01:05.001 --> 00:01:07.609
otherwise nobody is willing to
take it.

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:09.489
And so he made that very clear.
 

00:01:09.489 --> 00:01:12.569
In fact I think the whole point
of the play is about economics,

00:01:12.569 --> 00:01:14.968
The Merchant of Venice,
and he made both of these

00:01:14.968 --> 00:01:17.587
principles very clear,
but he couldn't quantify them

00:01:17.587 --> 00:01:19.239
and he couldn't mathematize
them,

00:01:19.239 --> 00:01:22.290
and the Capital Asset Pricing
Model gives a mathematical,

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.492
quantifiable form to both and a
quite shocking recommendation in

00:01:26.492 --> 00:01:27.360
both cases.
 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.659
So just to draw those two
pictures,

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:31.580
for those of you who didn't
hear it last night,

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:38.242
if you do Tobin's famous
picture, this is the

00:01:38.242 --> 00:01:46.269
Markowitz-Tobin Capital Market
Line they called it.

00:01:46.269 --> 00:01:49.220
It's very important to keep
straight what's on the diagram.

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:54.010
There's the standard deviation
of any asset per dollar.

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:55.840
So here I'm writing the price.
 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.371
So it's per dollar,
and here is the expectation of

00:02:00.371 --> 00:02:02.500
the asset per dollar.
 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.200
So pi of Y, I'm calling that
the price.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.438
So this is per dollar.
 

00:02:10.438 --> 00:02:13.128
And I'm not going to go over
what we derived before,

00:02:13.128 --> 00:02:16.780
but we noticed that if you took
all the risky assets,

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.530
any risky asset's going to have
per dollar,

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.366
if it's priced,
some standard deviation and

00:02:22.366 --> 00:02:23.650
some expectation.
 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.175
You can write down all the
risky assets,

00:02:26.175 --> 00:02:29.610
and you can combine them,
and you'll get a possibility

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.490
set that looks like this.
 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:35.662
So the diversification already
shows up in this picture because

00:02:35.662 --> 00:02:39.633
if you combine this asset and
this asset you're going to get

00:02:39.633 --> 00:02:43.470
possibilities by putting half of
your money in each,

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.199
not on the straight line
between them,

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:48.122
but on some curved line that's
much better because you're

00:02:48.122 --> 00:02:49.220
reducing your risk.
 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:55.740
So Markowitz already had that
curve and this picture in mind.

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:00.188
Tobin added the riskless asset,
which he put here,

00:03:00.188 --> 00:03:02.485
and then he said,
well, if there's a riskless

00:03:02.485 --> 00:03:05.513
asset everybody's going to do
the same thing and everyone's

00:03:05.513 --> 00:03:07.340
going to choose the same point.
 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:13.461
It's better for everybody,
so this is the optimal risky

00:03:13.461 --> 00:03:19.128
portfolio and it has to be equal
to the market,

00:03:19.128 --> 00:03:21.793
because if everybody's smart
enough to figure out what to do

00:03:21.793 --> 00:03:23.688
they're all going to do the same
thing,

00:03:23.688 --> 00:03:27.848
and whatever everybody holds
that's by definition the market.

00:03:27.848 --> 00:03:34.601
So Tobin showed that everybody
should choose something on this

00:03:34.601 --> 00:03:41.020
capital market line and so
everybody should split his money

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:45.889
between the market and a
riskless asset.

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:48.788
Put your money in the bank or
own the entire market.

00:03:48.788 --> 00:03:52.794
That was his recommendation and
that was the beginning of the

00:03:52.794 --> 00:03:54.930
whole idea of index investing.
 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.530
So that was the first idea,
first, most important idea.

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:03.218
Now, how could you test this?
 

00:04:03.218 --> 00:04:07.580
Well, you could simply test
every fund in history and

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:12.611
compare so called experts and
see if those guys could get you

00:04:12.611 --> 00:04:14.288
above this line.
 

00:04:14.288 --> 00:04:17.889
So by the way,
the slope of the line,

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:21.990
one more thing,
is the slope equals Sharpe

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.990
ratio.
 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:25.857
So everybody's trying to get
the highest Sharpe ratio they

00:04:25.857 --> 00:04:28.226
can,
and if you have this portfolio

00:04:28.226 --> 00:04:31.319
you've made a mistake,
you haven't held the optimal

00:04:31.319 --> 00:04:34.175
one, then the slope of your
performance will be a lower

00:04:34.175 --> 00:04:35.550
Sharpe ratio than that.
 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.829
The slope of this,
which is the Sharpe ratio of

00:04:37.829 --> 00:04:39.959
that point, is worse than the
slope of that,

00:04:39.959 --> 00:04:42.139
which is the Sharpe ratio of
this point.

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:46.151
And the Sharpe ratio,
remember, is (the expectation

00:04:46.151 --> 00:04:50.805
per dollar minus what you can
get in the riskless asset per

00:04:50.805 --> 00:04:55.779
dollar) divided by the started
deviation of Y per dollar,

00:04:55.779 --> 00:04:57.529
let's say.
 

00:04:57.529 --> 00:05:00.069
So that's just the slope of
this line.

00:05:00.069 --> 00:05:03.504
So we can measure performance
of a portfolio manger by the

00:05:03.504 --> 00:05:04.410
Sharpe ratio.
 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:06.639
Everyone should try and get the
highest Sharpe ratio.

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:10.206
The upshot of diversification
is you should buy a little bit

00:05:10.206 --> 00:05:13.410
of every stock in the economy no
matter how small,

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:15.120
no matter how big,
no matter how safe,

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.610
no matter how risky,
you should spread your money

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:18.649
across everything.
 

00:05:18.649 --> 00:05:20.980
That's the recommendation of
Tobin.

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:22.952
And it relies,
of course, on everybody else

00:05:22.952 --> 00:05:25.019
being rational,
so everybody else is choosing

00:05:25.019 --> 00:05:25.959
the right thing.
 

00:05:25.959 --> 00:05:30.959
Then you can just piggyback and
do what everybody else is doing.

00:05:30.959 --> 00:05:32.430
So that's the first thing.
 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:35.060
Very shocking,
as I said, at first glance

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:39.007
you'd think someone who loves
risk would just invest in risky

00:05:39.007 --> 00:05:43.086
stocks and people who are very
risk averse would just invest in

00:05:43.086 --> 00:05:44.269
safe stocks.
 

00:05:44.269 --> 00:05:45.730
Tobin says, no, no, no, no.
 

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:49.107
If you're risk averse you
should just put most of your

00:05:49.107 --> 00:05:52.740
money in the bank and hold a
little bit of every stock.

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:53.850
So you're here somewhere.
 

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:56.822
If you're very risk tolerant
you shouldn't just concentrate

00:05:56.822 --> 00:05:57.949
on the risky stocks.
 

00:05:57.949 --> 00:06:00.379
You should buy the same
proportion of all stocks as

00:06:00.379 --> 00:06:02.567
everyone else,
but you should borrow the money

00:06:02.567 --> 00:06:04.269
to do it and maybe way up here.
 

00:06:04.269 --> 00:06:10.509
And people who borrow money to
invest that's called leveraging.

00:06:10.509 --> 00:06:14.300
So that's idea number one,
the crucial idea.

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:15.959
There are a lot of ideas mixed
in that,

00:06:15.959 --> 00:06:18.589
and as I said,
you can test it by seeing if

00:06:18.589 --> 00:06:22.052
anyone can beat the market--
is there anyone historically

00:06:22.052 --> 00:06:24.990
that has had a higher Sharpe
ratio than the market.

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:32.473
In 1967 when all of this was
being tested there was a famous

00:06:32.473 --> 00:06:40.720
book called A Random Walk Down
Wall Street written by Malkiel,

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:45.759
which I recommend you read.
 

00:06:45.759 --> 00:06:48.069
He gives the history of tests
of whether people could beat the

00:06:48.069 --> 00:06:48.410
market.
 

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:51.178
Of course many people beat the
market for short periods of

00:06:51.178 --> 00:06:51.519
time.
 

00:06:51.519 --> 00:06:52.839
Then they totally collapse.
 

00:06:52.839 --> 00:06:56.692
And then some people beat the
market for 20 years in a row and

00:06:56.692 --> 00:06:59.084
then retire,
but there are so few of those

00:06:59.084 --> 00:07:02.024
people that it looks like just
by random dumb luck you could

00:07:02.024 --> 00:07:03.370
get almost those people.
 

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:05.605
On the other hand there are
some people like Warren Buffet

00:07:05.605 --> 00:07:07.528
who seem to beat the market for
40 or 50 years.

00:07:07.528 --> 00:07:10.670
It's really hard to believe
that that's all just luck.

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:15.250
And so that's one test of the
thing.

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:19.336
The second idea of the Capital
Asset Pricing Model is risk and

00:07:19.336 --> 00:07:19.939
return.
 

00:07:19.939 --> 00:07:24.550
And so now if we assume--so all
this graph,

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:29.870
by the way, assumed quadratic
utilities,

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:32.629
quadratic or mean variance
utilities,

00:07:32.629 --> 00:07:39.540
quadratic utility and common
probabilities.

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:41.658
So everybody knew what the
probabilities were of the

00:07:41.658 --> 00:07:43.754
different states,
so you know how to measure the

00:07:43.754 --> 00:07:46.329
covariance and the variance and
all that because you know what

00:07:46.329 --> 00:07:48.060
the probabilities are to measure
over.

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:52.478
So here, having assumed that,
it turns out that you just

00:07:52.478 --> 00:07:57.540
apply the principle that we saw
the first few days of class,

00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:06.149
that the price is going to
equal the marginal utility,

00:08:06.149 --> 00:08:07.550
not the total utility.
 

00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:10.850
Price is going to equal
marginal utility and if the

00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:14.547
price equals the marginal
utility the marginal utility is

00:08:14.547 --> 00:08:18.086
going to be--
depends, according to this

00:08:18.086 --> 00:08:22.639
assumption of quadratic
utilities as we showed,

00:08:22.639 --> 00:08:27.069
depends on expectation.
 

00:08:27.069 --> 00:08:30.773
So this is the price of Y,
so let's just call it pi of Y

00:08:30.773 --> 00:08:32.120
like I did before.
 

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:38.972
It depends on the expectation
of Y and it depends on the

00:08:38.972 --> 00:08:43.210
covariance of Y with the market.
 

00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:47.269
We've assumed with quadratic
utilities that people only care

00:08:47.269 --> 00:08:51.105
about the mean and the variance,
so you'd have expected the

00:08:51.105 --> 00:08:54.447
marginal utility of any single
asset to depend on its mean and

00:08:54.447 --> 00:08:57.110
its variance,
but it's the marginal utility.

00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:59.450
It's what it adds to what
you've already got.

00:08:59.450 --> 00:09:02.428
So it adds expectation because
expectation's additive,

00:09:02.428 --> 00:09:05.399
but when you add another stock
to what you already have,

00:09:05.399 --> 00:09:08.647
the variance of the whole
portfolio changes according to

00:09:08.647 --> 00:09:12.250
the covariance of the new thing
with what you already had,

00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:13.950
and everybody already had the
market.

00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:18.210
So given that you know that the
price,

00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:22.208
mathematically therefore,
the price has to equal

00:09:22.208 --> 00:09:27.316
something times the expectation
of Y plus something times the

00:09:27.316 --> 00:09:30.379
covariance of Y with the market.
 

00:09:30.379 --> 00:09:32.350
But that's true for all Y.
 

00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:35.830
In particular it's true for the
riskless asset.

00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:40.664
So the riskless asset pays 1
for sure, has no covariance with

00:09:40.664 --> 00:09:45.340
anything like the market,
and its price is 1 over (1 r).

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:48.440
So therefore A has to be 1 over
(1 r).

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:51.710
So we know that this has to be
(1 r).

00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:55.029
And then B could be whatever it
is.

00:09:55.029 --> 00:09:57.307
The covariance,
by the way, is going to be bad,

00:09:57.307 --> 00:09:58.250
so this is minus.
 

00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:00.590
And then B, you have to figure
B out.

00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:04.100
So you don't know what B is a
priori.

00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:05.778
You don't know what the
interest rate is either.

00:10:05.778 --> 00:10:07.769
You had to see that in the
market.

00:10:07.769 --> 00:10:10.548
Once you know the price of one
asset,

00:10:10.548 --> 00:10:12.519
and you know its correlation
with the market,

00:10:12.519 --> 00:10:15.905
if you knew this price,
and you know the expectation of

00:10:15.905 --> 00:10:17.386
Y,
and you know the covariance

00:10:17.386 --> 00:10:19.028
with the market that will tell
you B.

00:10:19.028 --> 00:10:22.740
So once you've given one price
of a risky asset,

00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:25.078
like of the market as a whole,
you're going to be able to

00:10:25.078 --> 00:10:27.503
figure out the price of every
other asset because from that

00:10:27.503 --> 00:10:30.250
one price you can deduce B,
and once you have B you can

00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:31.190
price everything.
 

00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:34.100
So that's the second idea,
risk and return.

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:37.178
And you can see it graphically
and more dramatically,

00:10:37.178 --> 00:10:39.889
because if I take that same
equation,

00:10:39.889 --> 00:10:42.629
this is called the covariance
pricing formula,

00:10:42.629 --> 00:10:47.381
you take that and divide by pi
of Y you get 1 equals

00:10:47.381 --> 00:10:51.668
expectation of Y divided by the
price of Y--

00:10:51.668 --> 00:10:59.038
dividing both sides by pi of
Y-- minus B times the covariance

00:10:59.038 --> 00:11:03.460
of (Y over the price of Y) with
M.

00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:07.493
So that just tells me the
expectation and the covariance

00:11:07.493 --> 00:11:11.086
of a dollar's worth,
just like this was a dollar's

00:11:11.086 --> 00:11:11.820
worth.
 

00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:15.019
This was per dollar and this is
per dollar,

00:11:15.019 --> 00:11:20.418
so if you put the covariance of
Y and the pi of Y down here,

00:11:20.418 --> 00:11:25.033
and M over here,
and here you put expectation Y

00:11:25.033 --> 00:11:28.980
over pi of Y,
this just says this is just a

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:31.023
constant,
and this is a constant,

00:11:31.023 --> 00:11:33.379
so it says this and this are
linearly related.

00:11:33.379 --> 00:11:36.058
These are all securities who
have price 1.

00:11:36.058 --> 00:11:38.530
There has to be a linear
relationship between their

00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:41.596
expectation per dollar and their
covariance per dollar with the

00:11:41.596 --> 00:11:42.139
market.
 

00:11:42.139 --> 00:11:44.950
And as the covariance gets
higher the return gets higher.

00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:49.504
So if you take a stock with a
high covariance it's going to

00:11:49.504 --> 00:11:52.490
have to have a high expected
return.

00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:53.990
That's exactly what Shakespeare
said.

00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:57.711
If it's more risky people won't
hold it unless it's got a higher

00:11:57.711 --> 00:12:00.960
return, which means you can buy
it for a cheap price.

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:03.519
So its price is less than its
expectation.

00:12:03.519 --> 00:12:07.043
But the difference with
Shakespeare is we've quantified

00:12:07.043 --> 00:12:07.500
risk.
 

00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:10.028
It's not what you would have
thought, variance,

00:12:10.028 --> 00:12:11.019
it's covariance.
 

00:12:11.019 --> 00:12:11.720
And that's it.
 

00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:14.820
Those are the two big ideas and
you could test--

00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:22.509
so this is called the Security
Market Line,

00:12:22.509 --> 00:12:25.690
and you could test this by
asking is every stock--

00:12:25.690 --> 00:12:27.528
so if you look at every stock
last year,

00:12:27.528 --> 00:12:30.340
you look at its covariance,
you put a point here,

00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:32.750
then you look this year at its
expected return,

00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:34.629
of course some stocks are going
to be wild,

00:12:34.629 --> 00:12:37.298
but you average over a bunch of
stock and a bunch of years.

00:12:37.298 --> 00:12:41.226
Do you get things that lie in a
straight line or close to a

00:12:41.226 --> 00:12:42.308
straight line?
 

00:12:42.308 --> 00:12:46.485
And Sharpe, in 1967,
found that amazingly when you

00:12:46.485 --> 00:12:51.937
did that you got--so I described
last night exactly what his test

00:12:51.937 --> 00:12:52.620
was.
 

00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:55.624
You got something that looked
incredibly close to a straight

00:12:55.624 --> 00:12:56.490
line like that.
 

00:12:56.490 --> 00:12:59.368
So this was the greatest
triumph in the history of the

00:12:59.368 --> 00:13:01.144
social sciences,
it was called,

00:13:01.144 --> 00:13:03.220
because you had huge amounts of
data,

00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:07.830
huge capacity to test things,
a shocking conclusion,

00:13:07.830 --> 00:13:10.778
a shockingly precise theory to
test,

00:13:10.778 --> 00:13:13.980
and it fit the line so
incredibly closely.

00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:17.105
And it just swept,
it made a huge impression in

00:13:17.105 --> 00:13:21.115
finance and in economics and
lots of Nobel Prizes were given

00:13:21.115 --> 00:13:22.000
for this.
 

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.029
Sharpe won a Nobel Prize.
 

00:13:23.029 --> 00:13:24.360
Markowitz won a Nobel Prize.
 

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:26.519
Tobin won a Nobel Prize.
 

00:13:26.519 --> 00:13:28.558
Lintner died.
 

00:13:28.558 --> 00:13:33.308
He would have won a Nobel Prize
too.

00:13:33.308 --> 00:13:36.783
So this was the first major
triumph, the most important

00:13:36.783 --> 00:13:39.615
triumph of finance,
the Capital Asset Pricing

00:13:39.615 --> 00:13:40.259
Model.
 

00:13:40.259 --> 00:13:43.730
Now, as it happens,
as the theory's been tested

00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:48.259
over and over again every year
since 1967 it's performed more

00:13:48.259 --> 00:13:49.769
and more poorly.
 

00:13:49.769 --> 00:13:54.129
And so now when you do this you
get points that look like this,

00:13:54.129 --> 00:13:56.003
and like that,
and like this,

00:13:56.003 --> 00:13:59.750
and they don't seem to lie on a
straight line at all,

00:13:59.750 --> 00:14:03.408
and it's pretty shocking how up
until '67 or the early '70s that

00:14:03.408 --> 00:14:06.836
it seemed to work out perfectly
and now it doesn't work very

00:14:06.836 --> 00:14:07.360
well.
 

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:11.102
And this business they've also
discovered, according to this

00:14:11.102 --> 00:14:13.070
you couldn't beat the market.
 

00:14:13.070 --> 00:14:15.778
So how do you test whether
something beats the market?

00:14:15.778 --> 00:14:17.250
You can pick a bunch of people
and say,

00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:19.455
"Could they beat the
market,"

00:14:19.455 --> 00:14:22.937
or you can actually just make
up a strategy yourself like buy

00:14:22.937 --> 00:14:24.100
only new stocks.
 

00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:27.065
Just every year buy the stocks
that have come onto the S&amp;P

00:14:27.065 --> 00:14:30.133
500 for the first time,
or just buy the stocks that are

00:14:30.133 --> 00:14:31.528
the biggest 10 percent.
 

00:14:31.528 --> 00:14:34.397
And it turns out some of those
strategies actually do beat the

00:14:34.397 --> 00:14:34.820
market.
 

00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:38.068
So I don't have time to go into
the details, you know,

00:14:38.068 --> 00:14:40.460
that is they lie above or below
here.

00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:43.678
So the theory has come into--so
theory and doubt.

00:14:43.678 --> 00:14:47.625
And so what I'm going to talk
about next week is,

00:14:47.625 --> 00:14:51.817
and it certainly doesn't
explain the current crisis,

00:14:51.817 --> 00:14:55.269
so I want next week to explain
crisis.

00:14:55.269 --> 00:15:00.099
So next week I'm going to end
by giving another theory which

00:15:00.099 --> 00:15:05.418
is going to explain the crisis
and be different from this one,

00:15:05.418 --> 00:15:08.561
but of course it hasn't been
tested over 30 years or 50 years

00:15:08.561 --> 00:15:09.190
like CAPM.
 

00:15:09.190 --> 00:15:11.418
CAPM looked great for the first
20 years,

00:15:11.418 --> 00:15:14.753
so whatever I say next week
will probably turn out to be 90

00:15:14.753 --> 00:15:17.202
percent wrong,
but at the moment it looks

00:15:17.202 --> 00:15:17.940
pretty good.
 

00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:20.525
And I didn't want to spend half
the course on it in case in 20

00:15:20.525 --> 00:15:22.009
years it seemed to be
ridiculous.

00:15:22.009 --> 00:15:24.876
But anyway, I'm going to
present it anyway to those of

00:15:24.876 --> 00:15:26.879
you who want to hear it next
week,

00:15:26.879 --> 00:15:29.427
and it'll be,
I think, understandable and

00:15:29.427 --> 00:15:32.740
down to earth and it'll invoke a
very basic thing.

00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:34.984
Nowhere in this model did we
take into account,

00:15:34.984 --> 00:15:37.667
you know, when we say people
leverage that means they're

00:15:37.667 --> 00:15:39.960
borrowing money and choosing to
go up here.

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:43.570
We haven't taken into account
that they have to pay the money

00:15:43.570 --> 00:15:47.178
back, and who's going to trust
them to pay the money back?

00:15:47.178 --> 00:15:49.509
And forcing them to do
something to guarantee they're

00:15:49.509 --> 00:15:52.243
going to pay the money back is
going to change the theory in a

00:15:52.243 --> 00:15:54.879
critical way,
which I'll get to next week.

00:15:54.879 --> 00:15:56.820
Now, one last thing about the
theory,

00:15:56.820 --> 00:16:00.792
as I say, you test it by
seeing--nobody should be above

00:16:00.792 --> 00:16:04.470
this line and nobody should be
above this line,

00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:06.908
but of course you can find
people above this line.

00:16:06.908 --> 00:16:10.740
Swensen, to take a famous Yale
example, is above this line.

00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:16.519
And you can find people above
this line, Ellington.

00:16:16.519 --> 00:16:18.840
So Ellington,
let's say, above this line.

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:20.440
All right, so hedge funds.
 

00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:27.090
Let's call it an anonymous
hedge fund since we're on camera

00:16:27.090 --> 00:16:30.759
now, hedge fund,
hedge fund E.

00:16:30.759 --> 00:16:33.039
So the question is,
is that luck,

00:16:33.039 --> 00:16:37.530
they just did it a few years in
both cases like 15 years apiece,

00:16:37.530 --> 00:16:39.668
or does it mean something?
 

00:16:39.668 --> 00:16:42.408
All right, well,
so you can measure the,

00:16:42.408 --> 00:16:44.970
you know, if you believe this
theory and you just say,

00:16:44.970 --> 00:16:47.590
okay, let's say the theory's 99
percent true,

00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:50.068
it's just that there are a few
people who really do beat the

00:16:50.068 --> 00:16:52.279
market,
then you can decide by looking

00:16:52.279 --> 00:16:56.158
at these graphs just how good is
Swensen relative to the market?

00:16:56.158 --> 00:16:59.320
How good is this hedge fund
relative to the market?

00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:02.476
And so you have a way of
calibrating and measuring how

00:17:02.476 --> 00:17:03.490
well people do.
 

00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:06.516
So I don't have time to get
into that, but I would measure

00:17:06.516 --> 00:17:09.650
the quality of a hedge fund by
its marginal Sharpe ratio.

00:17:09.650 --> 00:17:12.006
How much does having access to
this hedge fund,

00:17:12.006 --> 00:17:14.413
if you added it to your
portfolio, increase your

00:17:14.413 --> 00:17:17.130
portfolio hedge ratio
[correction: Sharpe ratio]?

00:17:17.130 --> 00:17:19.426
That's, I think,
the right measure of how good a

00:17:19.426 --> 00:17:20.210
hedge fund is.
 

00:17:20.210 --> 00:17:23.455
And the right measure of how
good Swensen is,

00:17:23.455 --> 00:17:25.670
is, what's his Sharpe ratio?
 

00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:27.529
And so there's a different
criterion.

00:17:27.529 --> 00:17:28.769
I keep emphasizing this.
 

00:17:28.769 --> 00:17:32.644
Swensen is managing an entire
portfolio so you have to measure

00:17:32.644 --> 00:17:35.986
him on how's he done for Yale,
because Yale's not going to

00:17:35.986 --> 00:17:37.509
combine him with something else.
 

00:17:37.509 --> 00:17:39.430
It's just holding what he holds.
 

00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:41.288
So it's his Sharpe ratio.
 

00:17:41.288 --> 00:17:42.961
But Ellington,
you're going to combine

00:17:42.961 --> 00:17:44.500
Ellington with some other stuff.
 

00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:47.019
So Swensen might invest in
Ellington, but ten million other

00:17:47.019 --> 00:17:47.410
things.
 

00:17:47.410 --> 00:17:51.051
And so you have to say how much
is Ellington going to help

00:17:51.051 --> 00:17:52.650
Swensen's Sharpe ratio?
 

00:17:52.650 --> 00:17:55.434
So instead of Swensen's Sharpe
ratio how much is Ellington

00:17:55.434 --> 00:17:57.390
going to help the market Sharpe
ratio?

00:17:57.390 --> 00:18:01.805
So that's how you should
measure a hedge fund,

00:18:01.805 --> 00:18:06.807
its marginal Sharpe ratio,
and Swensen by his Sharpe

00:18:06.807 --> 00:18:07.788
ratio.
 

00:18:07.788 --> 00:18:20.390
So I'd say measure Swensen
performance by Sharpe ratio,

00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:30.528
measure hedge fund performance
by marginal Sharpe ratio,

00:18:30.528 --> 00:18:35.269
because you'd be crazy to put
all your money in a hedge fund.

00:18:35.269 --> 00:18:37.905
The only people who do it are
the partners of the hedge fund

00:18:37.905 --> 00:18:40.498
who are sort of forced to do it
because that's how they can

00:18:40.498 --> 00:18:43.313
persuade investors that they're
really paying attention to their

00:18:43.313 --> 00:18:46.757
fund,
because all their money's at

00:18:46.757 --> 00:18:47.380
risk.
 

00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:48.109
So that's it.
 

00:18:48.109 --> 00:18:49.368
That's the basic bottom line.
 

00:18:49.368 --> 00:18:54.838
So are there any questions
before I now move on from this?

00:18:54.838 --> 00:18:57.723
We talked about this last night
and we talked about it for the

00:18:57.723 --> 00:18:58.670
last two lectures.
 

00:18:58.670 --> 00:19:01.038
All right, so it's a high water
mark as I say;

00:19:01.038 --> 00:19:05.314
incredibly precise prediction
and incredibly close to the

00:19:05.314 --> 00:19:08.750
facts, at least in 1967 but not
after that.

00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:12.980
Now, I want to move to an aside
of Social Security before I come

00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:17.076
back to Black-Scholes which is
the last high water mark of the

00:19:17.076 --> 00:19:18.420
standard theory.
 

00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:23.690
Remember the upshot of what
we've talked about so far.

00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:38.210
The upshot of this is that the
market will get a higher return.

00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:39.700
Oh, by the way,
I'd say one other thing.

00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:45.358
What is the standard critique
of this theory?

00:19:45.358 --> 00:19:47.603
So of course everybody else has
seen that the theory doesn't

00:19:47.603 --> 00:19:47.868
work.
 

00:19:47.868 --> 00:19:50.318
So what is their explanation
for why?

00:19:50.318 --> 00:19:53.217
What's the old explanation for
why the theory isn't working so

00:19:53.217 --> 00:19:53.740
well now?
 

00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:57.375
The explanation is that in the
old days what was thought of as

00:19:57.375 --> 00:19:59.880
the market was just all American
stocks.

00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:02.191
But now it's pretty obvious,
in fact it should have been

00:20:02.191 --> 00:20:03.410
obvious from the beginning.
 

00:20:03.410 --> 00:20:07.446
And so Swensen realized it
early on that Markowitz's advice

00:20:07.446 --> 00:20:09.782
is to diversify,
diversify, diversify,

00:20:09.782 --> 00:20:11.519
not just into all American
stocks,

00:20:11.519 --> 00:20:14.221
into everything all over the
world and all kinds of assets

00:20:14.221 --> 00:20:15.548
that aren't stocks at all.
 

00:20:15.548 --> 00:20:18.594
So what you measure as the
market shouldn't just be

00:20:18.594 --> 00:20:19.690
American stocks.
 

00:20:19.690 --> 00:20:22.717
It should be the world
portfolio, but how do you

00:20:22.717 --> 00:20:24.650
measure the world portfolio?
 

00:20:24.650 --> 00:20:27.207
That's hard to do,
and so people have tried to

00:20:27.207 --> 00:20:30.503
maintain that the reason the
theory doesn't work is because

00:20:30.503 --> 00:20:33.288
we've got the wrong M in all
these equations.

00:20:33.288 --> 00:20:37.009
So that would be a nice way of
fixing the theory.

00:20:37.009 --> 00:20:39.700
I doubt if that's going to help
in the end.

00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:43.548
So my problem about collateral
is a different look at it.

00:20:43.548 --> 00:20:47.887
But anyhow, so the market
according to the theory will get

00:20:47.887 --> 00:20:52.150
a higher return than bonds,
and of course that's true.

00:20:52.150 --> 00:20:56.900
The market has a very high
positive covariance with itself

00:20:56.900 --> 00:20:59.400
so a very low price up here.
 

00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:02.098
It's high covariance with
itself, so a low price.

00:21:02.098 --> 00:21:04.369
Compared to its expectation the
price is low,

00:21:04.369 --> 00:21:06.950
so you're paying much less than
the expectation.

00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:10.000
So then when you see what
actually happens it's going to

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.609
look much higher than that.
 

00:21:11.609 --> 00:21:12.710
It's not just this.
 

00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:16.053
The price is lower therefore
the final outcome's going to be

00:21:16.053 --> 00:21:17.470
much bigger on average.
 

00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:21.674
So to put it another way,
if you had two possibilities

00:21:21.674 --> 00:21:24.690
which you knew were equally
likely,

00:21:24.690 --> 00:21:28.878
1 half and 1 half,
and the market paid off

00:21:28.878 --> 00:21:33.578
something good here and
something bad here,

00:21:33.578 --> 00:21:36.288
so everybody's rich here and
everybody's poor here.

00:21:36.288 --> 00:21:39.172
The price of the Arrow security
of this state is going to be

00:21:39.172 --> 00:21:42.298
much lower than the price of the
Arrow security of this state.

00:21:42.298 --> 00:21:45.118
So this state is going to have
a price,

00:21:45.118 --> 00:21:49.136
let's say .8,
and this one might have a price

00:21:49.136 --> 00:21:53.906
.2 because here the bad state,
that's when everybody's poor,

00:21:53.906 --> 00:21:56.288
so you're going to,
you know, this formula

00:21:56.288 --> 00:21:59.112
basically tells you that if
you're paying off here you're

00:21:59.112 --> 00:22:01.230
negatively correlated with the
market,

00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:03.752
you're going to have to pay a
very high price for it because

00:22:03.752 --> 00:22:04.480
you're hedging.
 

00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:08.018
By buying this security you're
balancing off what you have with

00:22:08.018 --> 00:22:08.759
the market.
 

00:22:08.759 --> 00:22:13.375
By buying the market,
people don't like that because

00:22:13.375 --> 00:22:17.450
it adds more risk to what you
already have.

00:22:17.450 --> 00:22:21.594
And so people don't like it so
they're not going pay very much,

00:22:21.594 --> 00:22:25.738
so the price will be much less
than the actual probability of 1

00:22:25.738 --> 00:22:26.338
half.
 

00:22:26.338 --> 00:22:28.048
So that's the conclusion of
what we've done.

00:22:28.048 --> 00:22:30.538
I want to now connect this to
Social Security.

00:22:30.538 --> 00:22:36.383
So you remember in our Social
Security model we had land that

00:22:36.383 --> 00:22:39.998
went here,
here, here, paid 1,1,

00:22:39.998 --> 00:22:43.798
1,1, 1, and we had these
people,

00:22:43.798 --> 00:22:47.250
overlapping generations-people
like that.

00:22:47.250 --> 00:22:51.019
And we discovered a very
important thing.

00:22:51.019 --> 00:22:54.952
The reason why Social Security
seems to be broke is because we

00:22:54.952 --> 00:22:59.078
gave away so much money to the
people in the first generation.

00:22:59.078 --> 00:23:01.786
It's not that Social Security
wastes money like George Bush

00:23:01.786 --> 00:23:03.838
seems to imply whenever he talks
about it.

00:23:03.838 --> 00:23:05.528
It's not like they just throw
it away.

00:23:05.528 --> 00:23:09.317
It's that we gave a huge gift
to the people in the '40s,

00:23:09.317 --> 00:23:13.309
the '50s and the '60s and so
everyone after that has to pay

00:23:13.309 --> 00:23:14.548
for that gift.
 

00:23:14.548 --> 00:23:19.104
But there's a little bit more
to George Bush's story than I've

00:23:19.104 --> 00:23:22.387
allowed so far,
which is that he wants to put

00:23:22.387 --> 00:23:24.328
the money into stocks.
 

00:23:24.328 --> 00:23:29.068
And we know that stocks are
going to get a higher return

00:23:29.068 --> 00:23:30.190
than bonds.
 

00:23:30.190 --> 00:23:32.450
That's the whole point of this
theory.

00:23:32.450 --> 00:23:35.157
You put money in stocks,
the expected return on stocks

00:23:35.157 --> 00:23:37.509
is higher than the expected
return on bonds.

00:23:37.509 --> 00:23:41.276
So if you want to make this
mathematical we have to add the

00:23:41.276 --> 00:23:45.237
possibility of risk and stocks
and it looks like it's going to

00:23:45.237 --> 00:23:48.798
be hopelessly complicated,
but we can do it very easily.

00:23:48.798 --> 00:23:54.171
So I'm going to reproduce the
same picture with uncertainty in

00:23:54.171 --> 00:23:57.574
stocks in it,
and then we're going to come

00:23:57.574 --> 00:24:01.634
back to Social Security and
spend 15 minutes talking about

00:24:01.634 --> 00:24:04.838
what's the right plan for Social
Security.

00:24:04.838 --> 00:24:08.160
So how could I take this simple
model,

00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:10.452
which already seemed
complicated, it's already a

00:24:10.452 --> 00:24:13.556
pretty complicated model,
had no uncertainty,

00:24:13.556 --> 00:24:16.390
and now put uncertainty in it?
 

00:24:16.390 --> 00:24:23.138
Well, I'm going to suppose that
land--so this is the land

00:24:23.138 --> 00:24:27.720
dividends I'm now going to
describe.

00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:29.457
And by the way,
I had people with endowments

00:24:29.457 --> 00:24:29.740
here.
 

00:24:29.740 --> 00:24:31.720
They were (3,1) and (3,1).
 

00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:34.439
Remember, this is their
endowments, but we didn't say

00:24:34.439 --> 00:24:36.269
where those endowments came
from.

00:24:36.269 --> 00:24:37.818
So I'm going to take the land
dividends.

00:24:37.818 --> 00:24:41.107
I'm going to suppose the
dividend of the land today is 1,

00:24:41.107 --> 00:24:44.220
but things might get better or
worse in the future.

00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:48.482
Maybe the dividend goes to 2 or
down to 1 half,

00:24:48.482 --> 00:24:49.038
say.
 

00:24:49.038 --> 00:24:53.058
I'm taking some extreme case
where it doubles or halves,

00:24:53.058 --> 00:24:56.900
and maybe after that it could
double again or it could go back

00:24:56.900 --> 00:25:00.740
to 1 and here it could go to 1
or it could go to 1 quarter.

00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:04.009
So what dividends are doing is
a random walk.

00:25:04.009 --> 00:25:08.683
If the economy starts getting
more productive then it's in a

00:25:08.683 --> 00:25:11.569
better position,
and from that point things get

00:25:11.569 --> 00:25:14.240
even more productive or maybe go
back to where they were.

00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:16.776
If things get worse they're
worse, but maybe things will

00:25:16.776 --> 00:25:19.220
start to get better again or
continue to get worse.

00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:24.480
So this is what I imagine as my
process of dividends.

00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:30.154
So if you own the land you get
all these dividends in the whole

00:25:30.154 --> 00:25:32.808
infinite future,
all right?

00:25:32.808 --> 00:25:36.215
And now let's say that there's
labor as well,

00:25:36.215 --> 00:25:37.608
so labor income.
 

00:25:37.608 --> 00:25:41.500
So I have to make an assumption
about labor income.

00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:48.390
So I'm going to assume only
young work.

00:25:48.390 --> 00:25:50.568
So here we kind of made the
same assumption.

00:25:50.568 --> 00:25:53.288
You get a lot when you're young
and not much when you're old.

00:25:53.288 --> 00:25:55.750
I'm going to assume only the
young work,

00:25:55.750 --> 00:26:01.157
and I'm going to assume that
this productivity gains or

00:26:01.157 --> 00:26:02.704
losses,
and by the way,

00:26:02.704 --> 00:26:04.160
you might think you never go
backwards.

00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:07.470
Maybe it goes from 1 to 2 or 1
to 1.1.

00:26:07.470 --> 00:26:11.720
So it's always growing,
but random.

00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:15.256
But I'm just going to keep it
here since I solved this example

00:26:15.256 --> 00:26:16.009
last night.
 

00:26:16.009 --> 00:26:18.892
I might as well stick to that
one, but there's no reason

00:26:18.892 --> 00:26:21.775
why--I could have made the thing
always, no matter what,

00:26:21.775 --> 00:26:23.818
either stay the same or get
better.

00:26:23.818 --> 00:26:25.880
That might have been a better
example to do,

00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:29.182
more realistic because we don't
really have tremendous

00:26:29.182 --> 00:26:32.686
productivity declines,
but anyway, all I mean to do is

00:26:32.686 --> 00:26:34.509
to put some randomness here.
 

00:26:34.509 --> 00:26:42.509
So only young work and wages
proportional to dividends,

00:26:42.509 --> 00:26:50.955
so let's just assume this,
so I'm assuming--this is what's

00:26:50.955 --> 00:26:56.288
called neutral technical change.
 

00:26:56.288 --> 00:26:58.920
So presumably the reason why
productivity is going up,

00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:01.207
the dividends are getting
higher, is there are more

00:27:01.207 --> 00:27:03.450
discoveries improving the
product of the land,

00:27:03.450 --> 00:27:05.910
but they're probably also
improving the product of labor,

00:27:05.910 --> 00:27:08.380
and so let's say they have same
effect on both.

00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:12.080
So I'm going to assume that
labor is actually--put the 1

00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:12.618
above.
 

00:27:12.618 --> 00:27:20.318
Let's say labor always gets 3
times what dividends are.

00:27:20.318 --> 00:27:25.472
So this is a 6 and this will be
3 halves, and this will be 12

00:27:25.472 --> 00:27:29.768
and 3 again and 3 quarters,
so that's what labor is

00:27:29.768 --> 00:27:32.259
getting, so labor income.
 

00:27:32.259 --> 00:27:38.038
I shouldn't have switched
colors, labor income.

00:27:38.038 --> 00:27:43.374
So that's my complicated world,
way more complicated than it

00:27:43.374 --> 00:27:44.548
was before.
 

00:27:44.548 --> 00:27:47.118
So if you own the land you get
all the dividends in the future.

00:27:47.118 --> 00:27:50.681
People live two periods,
so I'm going to assume that

00:27:50.681 --> 00:27:54.037
utility--
so you're going to live when

00:27:54.037 --> 00:27:58.844
you're young and then when
you're old and up and when

00:27:58.844 --> 00:28:00.970
you're old and down.
 

00:28:00.970 --> 00:28:04.121
So you're going to live--let's
say a guy born here,

00:28:04.121 --> 00:28:06.578
he's young here,
or she's young here.

00:28:06.578 --> 00:28:10.032
She can work here,
and then she's going to be old

00:28:10.032 --> 00:28:12.983
here and here,
but when she's old it's not

00:28:12.983 --> 00:28:16.868
clear how good her investment's
going to turn out.

00:28:16.868 --> 00:28:20.058
So this is going to just be our
simple log.

00:28:20.058 --> 00:28:27.554
I'll call this 1 half log Y 1
quarter log Z_up 1

00:28:27.554 --> 00:28:31.630
quarter log Z_down.
 

00:28:31.630 --> 00:28:34.759
So you don't discount the
future, let's say,

00:28:34.759 --> 00:28:37.500
you just take log of
consumption today plus

00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:41.220
probability 1 half of log
consumption in the up state,

00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:43.118
1 half log consumption in the
down state.

00:28:43.118 --> 00:28:47.029
So the probabilities here are 1
half.

00:28:47.029 --> 00:28:50.630
These are the objective
probabilities.

00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:54.000
So maybe I should have written
the utility--maybe better it

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.848
would have been to write the
utility like that.

00:28:56.848 --> 00:29:00.779
That's what people know,
what the probabilities are.

00:29:00.779 --> 00:29:01.759
So that's it.
 

00:29:01.759 --> 00:29:05.069
That's my set up.
 

00:29:05.069 --> 00:29:07.819
So what should the economy do?
 

00:29:07.819 --> 00:29:08.680
What should people do?
 

00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:13.703
You see, if you buy--if you're
some person like this woman

00:29:13.703 --> 00:29:16.497
here,
she could decide to hold bonds,

00:29:16.497 --> 00:29:20.740
and she could get whatever the
interest rate turns out to be,

00:29:20.740 --> 00:29:22.240
which we're going to compute in
a minute,

00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:25.349
or she could hold stock in
which case she's going to get--

00:29:25.349 --> 00:29:28.480
let's start her off here, maybe.
 

00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:31.950
She could buy land;
buy stock.

00:29:31.950 --> 00:29:33.289
Now we don't know what the
price is yet.

00:29:33.289 --> 00:29:34.240
We have to compute that.
 

00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:36.916
But if she buys the stock
she'll get a dividend of 2 here

00:29:36.916 --> 00:29:39.259
and be able to sell the land for
a high price,

00:29:39.259 --> 00:29:41.730
because from here on it's
obviously pretty productive,

00:29:41.730 --> 00:29:45.045
better than it was back here,
or she might get unlucky and

00:29:45.045 --> 00:29:47.421
the price might,
you know, the dividend might be

00:29:47.421 --> 00:29:48.762
really terrible,
just 1 half,

00:29:48.762 --> 00:29:51.878
and not only that but the land
she sells when she's old is also

00:29:51.878 --> 00:29:53.788
going to have a really lousy
price.

00:29:53.788 --> 00:29:57.060
So if she holds land she's
going to get a high dividend and

00:29:57.060 --> 00:29:59.882
a high capital return,
or else a low dividend and a

00:29:59.882 --> 00:30:01.180
low capital return.
 

00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:04.107
It's really risky for her,
or she could just buy a bond at

00:30:04.107 --> 00:30:07.086
whatever interest rate it turns
out to be and get something

00:30:07.086 --> 00:30:07.548
safe.
 

00:30:07.548 --> 00:30:12.299
So what should she do,
and will that be a good thing

00:30:12.299 --> 00:30:17.796
for the economy or can we make
everybody better off by using

00:30:17.796 --> 00:30:19.660
Social Security?
 

00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:29.558
So how can we solve this?
 

00:30:29.558 --> 00:30:31.986
So it looks like a really
complicated model to solve

00:30:31.986 --> 00:30:34.078
because we've got a generation
born here,

00:30:34.078 --> 00:30:36.625
another one born here,
the same generation might be

00:30:36.625 --> 00:30:38.970
born up here under different
circumstances,

00:30:38.970 --> 00:30:41.957
and then this generation here
could be born under any of three

00:30:41.957 --> 00:30:47.288
different circumstances,
so there's a lot to solve for.

00:30:47.288 --> 00:30:51.380
But what we know is that when
we compute the Arrow price,

00:30:51.380 --> 00:30:54.642
starting from any point,
this Arrow price is going to be

00:30:54.642 --> 00:30:57.963
bigger than 1 half and this
one's going to be less than 1

00:30:57.963 --> 00:31:01.286
half because the economy is
doing much worse down here so

00:31:01.286 --> 00:31:04.667
people know they're all going to
get screwed down here and

00:31:04.667 --> 00:31:06.269
consume a lot less.
 

00:31:06.269 --> 00:31:08.884
So to hedge that they're all
going to want to buy,

00:31:08.884 --> 00:31:12.140
they're going to be desperate
to buy consumption down here.

00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:14.869
Of course they can't all do
that, so it's got to be the

00:31:14.869 --> 00:31:17.953
price that's more than 1 half
that discourages them from doing

00:31:17.953 --> 00:31:18.410
that.
 

00:31:18.410 --> 00:31:21.159
And they don't really need that
much to buy up here because

00:31:21.159 --> 00:31:23.198
their dividends,
they're going to be so rich

00:31:23.198 --> 00:31:23.720
anyway.
 

00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:27.383
So the price of the Arrow
security is going to be less

00:31:27.383 --> 00:31:31.460
than 1 half because there's so
much that they have to end up

00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:34.640
holding and that'll encourage
them to buy.

00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:36.548
I mean, sorry,
I said the logic backwards.

00:31:36.548 --> 00:31:38.641
There's so much that they're
going to have to end up

00:31:38.641 --> 00:31:40.650
consuming because the economy is
so productive.

00:31:40.650 --> 00:31:43.480
How can you get them to plan to
consume that much up there?

00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:45.858
It's by having a low Arrow
security price.

00:31:45.858 --> 00:31:48.385
So even in advance they know
that they're going to end up

00:31:48.385 --> 00:31:51.048
consuming a lot and they're
happy to do that because they're

00:31:51.048 --> 00:31:53.799
willing to buy Arrow securities
because they're so cheap.

00:31:53.799 --> 00:31:58.338
So how do we solve all this?
 

00:31:58.338 --> 00:32:00.058
So everybody following the
problem?

00:32:00.058 --> 00:32:02.711
It's quite a complicated
problem, but it turns out to

00:32:02.711 --> 00:32:04.140
have a very simple answer.
 

00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:04.670
Yep?
 

00:32:04.670 --> 00:32:08.980
Student: So the down
state, the price of consumption

00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:11.880
is high but the price of land is
low?

00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:12.980
Prof: Right, so.
 

00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:17.686
Well, so if you start--starting
from here the price of

00:32:17.686 --> 00:32:20.643
consumption--
if you want to buy at this

00:32:20.643 --> 00:32:22.828
point, consumption at this
point,

00:32:22.828 --> 00:32:25.650
you're going to have to pay
more than 1 half to get it,

00:32:25.650 --> 00:32:29.827
but you know that once you get
here the price of land is going

00:32:29.827 --> 00:32:31.059
to have dropped.
 

00:32:31.059 --> 00:32:32.259
So yes, I'm agreeing with you.
 

00:32:32.259 --> 00:32:35.133
Student: I understand
the first part because the CAPM

00:32:35.133 --> 00:32:35.618
price...
 

00:32:35.618 --> 00:32:37.211
Prof: Right,
now why should the price of

00:32:37.211 --> 00:32:37.940
land be lower here?
 

00:32:37.940 --> 00:32:42.606
Remember, the price of land is
always in terms of the

00:32:42.606 --> 00:32:45.390
consumption good that period.
 

00:32:45.390 --> 00:32:48.773
Every period I might as well
take an apple to have a price of

00:32:48.773 --> 00:32:49.000
1.
 

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:52.505
So you see, the land here is
producing an entire apple,

00:32:52.505 --> 00:32:56.140
and on average going forward
it's going to be producing 1

00:32:56.140 --> 00:32:56.788
apple.
 

00:32:56.788 --> 00:32:59.404
The geometric average of all
these numbers is 1 starting at

00:32:59.404 --> 00:32:59.990
this point.
 

00:32:59.990 --> 00:33:03.588
Once you've gone down to here
production has deteriorated.

00:33:03.588 --> 00:33:05.930
The land is only producing 1
half an apple here,

00:33:05.930 --> 00:33:08.286
and in the future instead of
producing 12 it's going to

00:33:08.286 --> 00:33:10.730
produce 3 apples here and only 3
quarters of an apple.

00:33:10.730 --> 00:33:13.414
So it's crummier land down
here, so you're going to pay

00:33:13.414 --> 00:33:14.410
less for the land.
 

00:33:14.410 --> 00:33:17.950
Any other questions?
 

00:33:17.950 --> 00:33:21.433
But I'm going to tell you
exactly what you'll pay for the

00:33:21.433 --> 00:33:21.869
land.
 

00:33:21.869 --> 00:33:23.430
So we're going to solve this.
 

00:33:23.430 --> 00:33:37.980
So need to solve for land price
in each state,

00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:56.365
and interest rate at each
state, and price of up Arrow

00:33:56.365 --> 00:34:06.107
security,
and price of down Arrow

00:34:06.107 --> 00:34:11.929
security at each state.
 

00:34:11.929 --> 00:34:14.110
So how can we do all that?
 

00:34:14.110 --> 00:34:17.226
Well, first of all you notice
that the Arrow securities are

00:34:17.226 --> 00:34:18.139
always the key.
 

00:34:18.139 --> 00:34:21.780
Once you solve for those you
can figure out everything else.

00:34:21.780 --> 00:34:28.052
So we just have to solve for
these, the price of the up and

00:34:28.052 --> 00:34:32.268
down Arrow securities in every
state.

00:34:32.268 --> 00:34:41.989
Oh, this was me in a previous
class today.

00:34:41.989 --> 00:34:43.530
I didn't erase it.
 

00:34:43.530 --> 00:35:00.239
I figured the next guy would do
it, serves me right.

00:35:00.239 --> 00:35:03.469
So how can we solve this?
 

00:35:03.469 --> 00:35:15.697
Well, we can guess,
let's do it up here,

00:35:15.697 --> 00:35:27.300
guess that these prices,
Arrow prices,

00:35:27.300 --> 00:35:36.079
the same at every state.
 

00:35:36.079 --> 00:35:38.489
So what do I mean by that?
 

00:35:38.489 --> 00:35:41.358
I mean, here,
how many apples would you pay

00:35:41.358 --> 00:35:42.929
to get an apple here?
 

00:35:42.929 --> 00:35:47.405
I'm guessing that that's the
same amount you would pay here

00:35:47.405 --> 00:35:49.179
to get an apple here.
 

00:35:49.179 --> 00:35:53.050
And what you'd pay in apples at
this point to get an apple down

00:35:53.050 --> 00:35:56.983
here is going to be the same as
this generation would pay to get

00:35:56.983 --> 00:35:58.420
an apple down here.
 

00:35:58.420 --> 00:35:59.250
That's a guess.
 

00:35:59.250 --> 00:36:00.768
We have to verify that that's
going to work.

00:36:00.768 --> 00:36:10.161
It seems like everything is
sort of homogeneous,

00:36:10.161 --> 00:36:22.552
and so guess that price of land
is proportional to dividends in

00:36:22.552 --> 00:36:25.550
that state.
 

00:36:25.550 --> 00:36:28.239
Well, the whole thing is sort
of homogeneous and everything,

00:36:28.239 --> 00:36:32.489
so if the land here is 4 times
as good as the land here,

00:36:32.489 --> 00:36:36.119
the land here is 4 times as
good as the land here,

00:36:36.119 --> 00:36:39.338
because the dividends are
always 4 times higher if you go

00:36:39.338 --> 00:36:40.199
up one thing.
 

00:36:40.199 --> 00:36:42.579
So this is 4 times that,
that's 4 times that.

00:36:42.579 --> 00:36:46.503
So why not guess that the price
of land is 4 times here than it

00:36:46.503 --> 00:36:49.480
is here, 4 times higher here
than it is here.

00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:51.322
Sounds possible,
anyway, and of course these are

00:36:51.322 --> 00:36:52.969
going to turn out to be correct
guesses.

00:36:52.969 --> 00:36:57.728
So once you make these guesses
it's going to be very simple to

00:36:57.728 --> 00:37:01.786
find the equilibrium,
and then we can verify that the

00:37:01.786 --> 00:37:03.659
guesses are correct.
 

00:37:03.659 --> 00:37:07.389
So what does this guy want to
do here?

00:37:07.389 --> 00:37:09.409
So assume you only work when
you're young.

00:37:09.409 --> 00:37:10.559
So what's your income?
 

00:37:10.559 --> 00:37:13.639
What's anybody's income like
this young guy here?

00:37:13.639 --> 00:37:19.746
Young at time 1,
so this is time 1 here,

00:37:19.746 --> 00:37:26.164
time 2, time 3,
time 4, so at time 1 their

00:37:26.164 --> 00:37:34.150
income is 3 because that's what
their wage was.

00:37:34.150 --> 00:37:37.590
They work when they're young
and they've got three.

00:37:37.590 --> 00:37:38.090
That's it.
 

00:37:38.090 --> 00:37:39.460
They don't own the land when
they're born.

00:37:39.460 --> 00:37:42.760
They're going to buy the land
but they don't own it now,

00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:44.739
and so what do they want to do?
 

00:37:44.739 --> 00:37:46.786
They want to consume when
they're young,

00:37:46.786 --> 00:37:48.150
their utility,
remember?

00:37:48.150 --> 00:37:51.030
So what's their budget set?
 

00:37:51.030 --> 00:37:55.543
Their budget set is they can
consume Y, that's consuming

00:37:55.543 --> 00:37:58.909
here, or they can consume here
or here.

00:37:58.909 --> 00:38:03.135
So they can consume
P_up times

00:38:03.135 --> 00:38:09.309
Z_up P_down
times Z_down.

00:38:09.309 --> 00:38:12.289
That's what they can do with
those Arrow securities.

00:38:12.289 --> 00:38:15.530
So what are they trying to
maximize?

00:38:15.530 --> 00:38:22.798
They're trying to maximize 1
half log Y 1 quarter log

00:38:22.798 --> 00:38:29.510
Z_up 1 quarter log
Z_down.

00:38:29.510 --> 00:38:32.179
That's what they're trying to
do.

00:38:32.179 --> 00:38:34.619
So what do we have to do?
 

00:38:34.619 --> 00:38:37.980
We have to clear this market
and this market given what the

00:38:37.980 --> 00:38:40.530
young are going to do in the
next period,

00:38:40.530 --> 00:38:43.030
but let's see what this guy's
going to do when he's young.

00:38:43.030 --> 00:38:46.358
Everybody is going to face a
similar, basically a scaled up

00:38:46.358 --> 00:38:47.849
version of this problem.
 

00:38:47.849 --> 00:38:49.659
So this is what the guy is
doing here.

00:38:49.659 --> 00:38:52.911
He's got an income of 3 and
there's the price of up and down

00:38:52.911 --> 00:38:53.960
Arrow securities.
 

00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:57.695
That's going to tell him what
to consume here and what to plan

00:38:57.695 --> 00:38:59.840
to consume up here and down
here.

00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:01.690
Student: Do you change
your utility function?

00:39:01.690 --> 00:39:03.347
Prof: So utility
function is the same one as

00:39:03.347 --> 00:39:03.579
this.
 

00:39:03.579 --> 00:39:06.639
I just multiplied through by 1
half, right?

00:39:06.639 --> 00:39:09.684
So I put 1 half,
1 quarter, 1 quarter to get

00:39:09.684 --> 00:39:10.179
that.
 

00:39:10.179 --> 00:39:14.230
So I've just multiplied it all
by a constant.

00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:16.469
So now the coefficients add up
to 1;

00:39:16.469 --> 00:39:18.039
1 half, 1 quarter and 1 quarter.
 

00:39:18.039 --> 00:39:20.619
That's his budget constraint,
but what's the budget

00:39:20.619 --> 00:39:22.889
constraint going to be of a guy
down here?

00:39:22.889 --> 00:39:24.179
It's exactly the same.
 

00:39:24.179 --> 00:39:28.079
He's going to maximize the same
utility function and his budget

00:39:28.079 --> 00:39:30.420
constraint,
since the prices of the Arrow

00:39:30.420 --> 00:39:34.045
securities are the same,
the only difference is going to

00:39:34.045 --> 00:39:36.809
be that he's only got 3 halves
here.

00:39:36.809 --> 00:39:39.079
So they're pretty similar
problems.

00:39:39.079 --> 00:39:41.829
So let's see what the guy at
time 1 is going to do.

00:39:41.829 --> 00:39:49.030
That's going to imply that Y =
(Cobb-Douglas) 1 half times (his

00:39:49.030 --> 00:39:55.420
income) 3 divided by the price
of Y which is just 1,

00:39:55.420 --> 00:40:03.110
so 1 half of 3 over 1 which is
3 halves.

00:40:03.110 --> 00:40:06.750
And what's he going do when
he's old?

00:40:06.750 --> 00:40:09.739
Z_up is going to
be--well,

00:40:09.739 --> 00:40:15.030
his Cobb-Douglas is 1 quarter,
and then his income is still 3,

00:40:15.030 --> 00:40:18.242
and then the price is
P_up of the Arrow

00:40:18.242 --> 00:40:18.980
security.
 

00:40:18.980 --> 00:40:26.114
In the down case he's going to
have 1 quarter times 3 (that's

00:40:26.114 --> 00:40:31.110
his income) divided by
P_down.

00:40:31.110 --> 00:40:33.949
So to clear this market what do
we have to do?

00:40:33.949 --> 00:40:37.380
We have to clear the market by
doing what?

00:40:37.380 --> 00:40:40.096
Z_up,
that's this guy,

00:40:40.096 --> 00:40:44.914
so 1 quarter (so this is the
old guy) times 3 divided by

00:40:44.914 --> 00:40:46.579
P_up.
 

00:40:46.579 --> 00:40:49.422
That's what this guy wants to
consume up here,

00:40:49.422 --> 00:40:53.088
plus what the young are going
to do there, but we know what

00:40:53.088 --> 00:40:55.300
the young are going to do here.
 

00:40:55.300 --> 00:40:58.739
This young person is doing
exactly what this guy did,

00:40:58.739 --> 00:41:02.376
except instead of having a
starting wealth of 3 he has a

00:41:02.376 --> 00:41:04.030
starting wealth of 6.
 

00:41:04.030 --> 00:41:07.554
So instead of consuming young 3
halves he's going to consume

00:41:07.554 --> 00:41:08.570
young 6 halves.
 

00:41:08.570 --> 00:41:12.449
So this is going to be plus 3.
 

00:41:12.449 --> 00:41:15.682
He's going to consume half of
his wages just like this guy

00:41:15.682 --> 00:41:18.349
consumed half of his wages when
he was young.

00:41:18.349 --> 00:41:21.409
So this new young guy,
the young guys are always going

00:41:21.409 --> 00:41:24.989
to consume in the first period
half of what their wages are.

00:41:24.989 --> 00:41:26.679
That's what this equation tells
us.

00:41:26.679 --> 00:41:29.192
If this is your budget set,
this is your income,

00:41:29.192 --> 00:41:32.077
this is what your budget set is
and this is what you're

00:41:32.077 --> 00:41:32.880
maximizing.
 

00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:36.182
This is a very special
Cobb-Douglas case where you have

00:41:36.182 --> 00:41:40.134
endowments only in one good,
so it's clear that in that good

00:41:40.134 --> 00:41:43.380
you'll always consume the
Cobb-Douglas coefficient

00:41:43.380 --> 00:41:47.210
fraction of it,
1 half of that, so 3 halves.

00:41:47.210 --> 00:41:52.210
And this guy's going to consume
1 half of 6 which is 3.

00:41:52.210 --> 00:41:55.800
So the old up here are going to
consume that number.

00:41:55.800 --> 00:42:03.403
The young are going to consume
3, and what's the total that's

00:42:03.403 --> 00:42:07.460
available for them to consume?
 

00:42:07.460 --> 00:42:08.639
What's available?
 

00:42:08.639 --> 00:42:10.730
Student: 6.
 

00:42:10.730 --> 00:42:12.940
Prof: No, more.
 

00:42:12.940 --> 00:42:13.989
Student: 8.
 

00:42:13.989 --> 00:42:17.884
Prof: 8;
the young got 6 apples and the

00:42:17.884 --> 00:42:24.440
land paid 2 apples in dividends,
so the total number of apples

00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:25.300
is 8.
 

00:42:25.300 --> 00:42:26.650
So that's it.
 

00:42:26.650 --> 00:42:31.690
And so we can solve that and
that's going to imply that

00:42:31.690 --> 00:42:36.795
multiplying--
so that's 5 and multiplying by

00:42:36.795 --> 00:42:39.414
4 is 20,
so P_U,

00:42:39.414 --> 00:42:42.840
of course I'm going to screw
this up now.

00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:48.563
P_U is 3 over 20,
because if you put 3 over 20 in

00:42:48.563 --> 00:42:54.780
here you get the 3s cancel and
you get 20 over 4 which is 5,

00:42:54.780 --> 00:42:57.860
and 5 3 is 8, so it's 3 over 20.
 

00:42:57.860 --> 00:43:00.431
Now meanwhile,
what are we going to have in

00:43:00.431 --> 00:43:01.349
the up state?
 

00:43:01.349 --> 00:43:02.730
In the up state...
 

00:43:02.730 --> 00:43:03.480
Student: In the down
state.

00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:04.019
Prof: Down state.
 

00:43:04.019 --> 00:43:05.369
That was the up state.
 

00:43:05.369 --> 00:43:13.751
In the down state the guy's
going to do 1 quarter 3 over

00:43:13.751 --> 00:43:16.190
P_D.
 

00:43:16.190 --> 00:43:18.150
What is this other guy going to
do?

00:43:18.150 --> 00:43:24.250
The young person here is going
to consume what?

00:43:24.250 --> 00:43:26.059
So in the downstate what are we
going to have?

00:43:26.059 --> 00:43:31.070
The equation of the downstate
is going to be--

00:43:31.070 --> 00:43:38.152
so this one 1 quarter 3 divided
by P_down plus what's

00:43:38.152 --> 00:43:43.179
this guy going to consume when
he's young?

00:43:43.179 --> 00:43:47.168
Well, his income,
his wages are 3 halves and he's

00:43:47.168 --> 00:43:51.489
going to consume half of that so
it's 3 quarters,

00:43:51.489 --> 00:43:54.150
right, because when you're
young you always end up

00:43:54.150 --> 00:43:57.802
consuming half of your wages,
so 3 quarters and that has to

00:43:57.802 --> 00:44:03.889
equal--
what's the total?

00:44:03.889 --> 00:44:07.880
2?
 

00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:11.679
2, so what does that leave us?
 

00:44:11.679 --> 00:44:15.452
That leaves us 3 quarters,
that's 5 fourths,

00:44:15.452 --> 00:44:16.768
so let's see.
 

00:44:16.768 --> 00:44:22.590
So 5 fourths equals 3 quarters
over P_D,

00:44:22.590 --> 00:44:30.380
so P_D is going to
equal 3 fifths,

00:44:30.380 --> 00:44:32.842
right, because the 4s drop out
and you put P_D up and

00:44:32.842 --> 00:44:34.429
the 5 down,
it's 3 fifths.

00:44:34.429 --> 00:44:35.280
So that's it.
 

00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:37.789
So now we've got--we've figured
out the prices.

00:44:37.789 --> 00:44:39.929
So this Arrow security was 1
half.

00:44:39.929 --> 00:44:42.228
I mean, the probabilities are 1
half, 1 half,

00:44:42.228 --> 00:44:44.369
but the prices,
the Arrow security prices,

00:44:44.369 --> 00:44:47.400
are going to be less than 1
half and more than 1 half.

00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:52.420
I forgot what they were
already, 3 twentieths,

00:44:52.420 --> 00:44:55.210
3 over 20 and 3 over 5.
 

00:44:55.210 --> 00:44:56.510
Those are the Arrow prices.
 

00:44:56.510 --> 00:44:58.610
By the way, you notice they
don't add up to 1.

00:44:58.610 --> 00:45:03.510
So what's the interest rate?
 

00:45:03.510 --> 00:45:07.014
So if you want to get--a
riskless bond pays 1 in each of

00:45:07.014 --> 00:45:09.963
these two states,
so how much is that worth,

00:45:09.963 --> 00:45:13.829
1 over (1 r) equals (You have
to buy both Arrow securities.

00:45:13.829 --> 00:45:15.090
We've done this before.)
 

00:45:15.090 --> 00:45:20.737
3 twentieths 3 fifths which
equals 15 twentieths,

00:45:20.737 --> 00:45:27.090
which equals 3 fourths,
so therefore 1 r = 4 thirds.

00:45:27.090 --> 00:45:30.550
So r is 33 percent.
 

00:45:30.550 --> 00:45:31.949
So that's what we did.
 

00:45:31.949 --> 00:45:36.349
We've got the probabilities,
3 twentieths and 3 fifths.

00:45:36.349 --> 00:45:39.177
Just as we thought the price of
the down Arrow security is going

00:45:39.177 --> 00:45:41.914
to be much bigger than the price
of the up Arrow security even

00:45:41.914 --> 00:45:44.250
though objectively they have
50/50 probability,

00:45:44.250 --> 00:45:45.550
and why is that?
 

00:45:45.550 --> 00:45:49.034
Because everyone who's rational
is going to realize that they

00:45:49.034 --> 00:45:52.518
have to plan to consume much
more up here than down here,

00:45:52.518 --> 00:45:56.634
but they're not going to want
to do that unless the price is

00:45:56.634 --> 00:45:57.679
much cheaper.
 

00:45:57.679 --> 00:45:59.099
So that's how we got the price.
 

00:45:59.099 --> 00:46:00.750
So now what's the price of land?
 

00:46:00.750 --> 00:46:03.764
That's the only last thing we
have to figure out,

00:46:03.764 --> 00:46:05.210
so the price of land.
 

00:46:05.210 --> 00:46:11.920
So the price of land at time 1
equals what?

00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:14.510
Well, what if you buy the land?
 

00:46:14.510 --> 00:46:17.510
What do you get?
 

00:46:17.510 --> 00:46:23.458
You get 3 twentieths,
then you get the dividend which

00:46:23.458 --> 00:46:28.835
is 2, but then you get to sell
the land which is

00:46:28.835 --> 00:46:31.809
P_land^(up).
 

00:46:31.809 --> 00:46:36.172
And then plus if you get the
down state you get a

00:46:36.172 --> 00:46:40.900
dividend--so the down state is
worth 3 fifths to you,

00:46:40.900 --> 00:46:41.809
right?
 

00:46:41.809 --> 00:46:43.289
And then what do you get?
 

00:46:43.289 --> 00:46:46.309
What's your dividend?
 

00:46:46.309 --> 00:46:52.331
1 half the price of the land
you can sell,

00:46:52.331 --> 00:46:56.150
P_land^(down).
 

00:46:56.150 --> 00:46:59.440
So that's what the price of
land is at 1.

00:46:59.440 --> 00:47:02.001
It depends, of course,
on what you can sell the price

00:47:02.001 --> 00:47:06.338
of land for in the future,
but we made a guess here that

00:47:06.338 --> 00:47:12.056
the price of land is just
proportional to the price of the

00:47:12.056 --> 00:47:13.260
dividend.
 

00:47:13.260 --> 00:47:16.204
So whatever the price of land
is here when the dividend is 1

00:47:16.204 --> 00:47:19.000
it should be twice as high here
and half as high here.

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:21.764
So therefore this,
instead of looking at it as the

00:47:21.764 --> 00:47:25.317
price of land went up it's going
to be twice the price that land

00:47:25.317 --> 00:47:27.010
was at the very beginning.
 

00:47:27.010 --> 00:47:30.443
So it's just 2 times the price
of land at the very beginning

00:47:30.443 --> 00:47:31.840
times that same price.
 

00:47:31.840 --> 00:47:35.869
And this price of land at down,
the dividend is half,

00:47:35.869 --> 00:47:38.498
so the land is sort of half as
good from here on out as it was

00:47:38.498 --> 00:47:42.496
in the beginning,
so let's guess the price of

00:47:42.496 --> 00:47:47.840
land is half of what it was at
the beginning.

00:47:47.840 --> 00:47:50.891
But now you see we've just got
P_land in terms of

00:47:50.891 --> 00:47:53.050
other stuff and so we can solve
for it.

00:47:53.050 --> 00:47:57.246
So the price of land is going
to equal--well,

00:47:57.246 --> 00:47:59.440
now it's complicated.
 

00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:08.800
So 3 tenths 3 tenths times the
price of land 3 tenths 3 tenths

00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:17.086
times the price of land,
and so that means the price of

00:48:17.086 --> 00:48:20.768
land minus 6 tenths.
 

00:48:20.768 --> 00:48:30.840
So 4 tenths the price of land
is going to equal 6 tenths.

00:48:30.840 --> 00:48:38.199
So the price of land is 3
halves at the beginning.

00:48:38.199 --> 00:48:40.530
So we figured out the price of
land here.

00:48:40.530 --> 00:48:45.849
Price of land is 3 halves at
the very beginning.

00:48:45.849 --> 00:48:48.349
So we've solved for the whole
equilibrium.

00:48:48.349 --> 00:48:51.244
It took a long time,
but I'm at the end of this

00:48:51.244 --> 00:48:52.000
story now.
 

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:54.710
So let's just review what we
did.

00:48:54.710 --> 00:48:58.809
And so I don't think it's that
complicated a story.

00:48:58.809 --> 00:49:03.280
The story is that you've got
land which has risky dividends.

00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:07.179
So instead of having one
straight line of what can happen

00:49:07.179 --> 00:49:11.150
in the future we've got this
infinitely expanding tree.

00:49:11.150 --> 00:49:14.775
So it's very hard to imagine
solving it, but then we've built

00:49:14.775 --> 00:49:16.829
in somewhat special assumptions.
 

00:49:16.829 --> 00:49:19.833
We've got all this homogeneity
and that allows us to solve it

00:49:19.833 --> 00:49:22.789
because it's the same problem
getting repeated over and over

00:49:22.789 --> 00:49:24.969
again,
just like we did before.

00:49:24.969 --> 00:49:27.679
So the price of land turns out
to be 3 halves.

00:49:27.679 --> 00:49:31.550
So what is this guy going to do?
 

00:49:31.550 --> 00:49:36.010
He's going to take his land,
his income which is 3,

00:49:36.010 --> 00:49:38.320
eat half of it,
which was 3 halves,

00:49:38.320 --> 00:49:40.360
that's what we said he always
does when he's young,

00:49:40.360 --> 00:49:43.909
spend half his income on
consumption,

00:49:43.909 --> 00:49:47.487
the rest of his income,
3 halves, he uses to buy all

00:49:47.487 --> 00:49:48.260
the land.
 

00:49:48.260 --> 00:49:52.507
Now, with the land he gets a
payoff of 2, but he gets to sell

00:49:52.507 --> 00:49:55.766
the land now for double the
price he bought it,

00:49:55.766 --> 00:49:56.969
namely for 3.
 

00:49:56.969 --> 00:50:01.880
So 2 3 is 5 and that,
by the way, the price of up was

00:50:01.880 --> 00:50:06.094
3 twentieths so this is 5,
right, because if I put in 3

00:50:06.094 --> 00:50:08.730
twentieths up here that's the
Arrow price of up,

00:50:08.730 --> 00:50:10.219
then Z_up is going to
be 5.

00:50:10.219 --> 00:50:11.768
And so that's exactly how we
got it.

00:50:11.768 --> 00:50:14.204
With the land he gets the
dividend of 2 plus he sells the

00:50:14.204 --> 00:50:14.769
land for 3.
 

00:50:14.769 --> 00:50:16.489
That's 5, so he does consume 5.
 

00:50:16.489 --> 00:50:18.523
Z_down,
incidentally,

00:50:18.523 --> 00:50:20.760
the price of down was 3 fifths.
 

00:50:20.760 --> 00:50:25.427
So the consumption of
down--what's consumption of down

00:50:25.427 --> 00:50:26.659
going to be?
 

00:50:26.659 --> 00:50:29.110
Student: 5 fourths.
 

00:50:29.110 --> 00:50:30.530
Prof: 5 fourths,
thank you.

00:50:30.530 --> 00:50:33.094
That'll be 5 fourths,
so let's see that that's going

00:50:33.094 --> 00:50:34.000
to work out too.
 

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:38.929
So the guy buys the land,
he gets his dividend of 1 half,

00:50:38.929 --> 00:50:42.420
and then he sells the land for
half of this price which is 3

00:50:42.420 --> 00:50:44.769
quarters,
and 1 half plus 3 quarters is 5

00:50:44.769 --> 00:50:46.360
fourths,
exactly what he's supposed to

00:50:46.360 --> 00:50:46.579
have.
 

00:50:46.579 --> 00:50:49.273
So you see it works out that
everybody's doing exactly what

00:50:49.273 --> 00:50:51.829
they're supposed to and all the
markets are clearing.

00:50:51.829 --> 00:50:55.077
Anyhow, the point is not so
much the numbers,

00:50:55.077 --> 00:50:58.380
the point is the following;
that sure enough,

00:50:58.380 --> 00:51:01.532
just as we said before,
the price of Arrow securities

00:51:01.532 --> 00:51:04.567
are going to be expensive when
things are going down and cheap

00:51:04.567 --> 00:51:05.960
when things are going up.
 

00:51:05.960 --> 00:51:09.644
The upshot of that is the
return on stocks,

00:51:09.644 --> 00:51:12.980
like land, is going to be very
high.

00:51:12.980 --> 00:51:16.869
You put in 3 halves and what
happens with the 3 halves?

00:51:16.869 --> 00:51:21.224
With probability 1 half,
that's what you put in,

00:51:21.224 --> 00:51:26.971
with probability 1 half you get
2 plus you get to sell the land

00:51:26.971 --> 00:51:29.010
for 3, which is 5.
 

00:51:29.010 --> 00:51:33.442
And with the other probability
1 half you get--the dividend is

00:51:33.442 --> 00:51:36.929
1 half, plus you sell the land
for 3 quarters.

00:51:36.929 --> 00:51:39.159
That's what you're eating,
5 and 5 fourths.

00:51:39.159 --> 00:51:48.077
That's equal to 5 halves 5
fourths 5--I don't know what

00:51:48.077 --> 00:51:49.730
this is.
 

00:51:49.730 --> 00:51:51.119
What is this?
 

00:51:51.119 --> 00:51:54.619
1 half 3 quarters is 5 fourths
times 1 half...

00:51:54.619 --> 00:51:55.070
Student: 5 eighths.
 

00:51:55.070 --> 00:51:57.730
Prof: It's 5 eighths
divided by 3 halves.

00:51:57.730 --> 00:51:59.250
So this is a very high number.
 

00:51:59.250 --> 00:52:00.400
So what is this?
 

00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:06.414
4 times that,
that's 25 over 8 divided by 3

00:52:06.414 --> 00:52:09.280
over 2 which is...
 

00:52:09.280 --> 00:52:11.179
Student: 25 over 12.
 

00:52:11.179 --> 00:52:11.719
Prof: Is what?
 

00:52:11.719 --> 00:52:13.679
Student: 25 over 12.
 

00:52:13.679 --> 00:52:15.360
Prof: 25 over 12,
is that what you said?

00:52:15.360 --> 00:52:16.869
Student: 25 over 12.
 

00:52:16.869 --> 00:52:19.800
Prof: 25 over 12,
I'm just believing you now.

00:52:19.800 --> 00:52:23.079
So that is over 200%, right?
 

00:52:23.079 --> 00:52:25.099
So your return is 100%.
 

00:52:25.099 --> 00:52:28.510
Whatever you put in you've more
than doubled your money in

00:52:28.510 --> 00:52:30.784
expectation, whereas the
interest rate,

00:52:30.784 --> 00:52:33.179
we said, was 33 and 1 third
percent.

00:52:33.179 --> 00:52:35.891
So of course you're getting a
tremendous return by putting

00:52:35.891 --> 00:52:38.746
your money into capital because
that's the whole point of the

00:52:38.746 --> 00:52:39.269
theory.
 

00:52:39.269 --> 00:52:40.610
It's risky.
 

00:52:40.610 --> 00:52:43.429
The whole economy is going to
be rich or poor together,

00:52:43.429 --> 00:52:46.304
so the price of capital,
on the margin it's a very risky

00:52:46.304 --> 00:52:47.139
thing to do.
 

00:52:47.139 --> 00:52:50.260
It just adds to this inequality
in your consumption.

00:52:50.260 --> 00:52:51.619
So the price is going to be low.
 

00:52:51.619 --> 00:52:53.530
You're going to get a very high
return.

00:52:53.530 --> 00:52:54.920
That's all I wanted to do.
 

00:52:54.920 --> 00:52:58.458
I just solved it out concretely
so you can see very clearly that

00:52:58.458 --> 00:53:01.099
you get a high return in the
good state and--

00:53:01.099 --> 00:53:03.369
you get a high return on
capital, much higher than the

00:53:03.369 --> 00:53:04.570
riskless rate of interest.
 

00:53:04.570 --> 00:53:05.309
So there we are.
 

00:53:05.309 --> 00:53:08.434
We're back at the beginning now
where George Bush--we can see

00:53:08.434 --> 00:53:11.038
that somewhere in the middle
here things are really

00:53:11.038 --> 00:53:11.820
disastrous.
 

00:53:11.820 --> 00:53:14.150
These people who are getting
Social Security,

00:53:14.150 --> 00:53:18.045
which means they're getting a
fixed amount here and here are

00:53:18.045 --> 00:53:21.190
doing really badly,
at least in expected return,

00:53:21.190 --> 00:53:24.329
compared to what they would do
in the stock market.

00:53:24.329 --> 00:53:30.940
And so what should we do about
that, and is it true that just

00:53:30.940 --> 00:53:37.440
because stocks make a higher
return, we should privatize?

00:53:37.440 --> 00:53:38.409
So what do you think now?
 

00:53:38.409 --> 00:53:40.170
Where are we in this argument?
 

00:53:40.170 --> 00:53:47.110
Has anything materially changed?
 

00:53:47.110 --> 00:53:50.614
So George Bush is saying,
and many Republicans say,

00:53:50.614 --> 00:53:54.539
that we should let people,
you know, get them invested in

00:53:54.539 --> 00:53:55.309
stocks.
 

00:53:55.309 --> 00:53:57.659
There's a higher expected
return.

00:53:57.659 --> 00:54:10.480
So what do we think about that?
 

00:54:10.480 --> 00:54:23.820
What do you think about that?
 

00:54:23.820 --> 00:54:25.909
This is a real policy issue
here.

00:54:25.909 --> 00:54:27.239
We've got this problem in
America.

00:54:27.239 --> 00:54:31.429
Right now we've got this huge
deficit in Social Security.

00:54:31.429 --> 00:54:34.900
The rate of return has gotten
really poor for your generation.

00:54:34.900 --> 00:54:37.550
You're looking forward to not
making very much money,

00:54:37.550 --> 00:54:40.590
and now we know theoretically,
confirming what we've seen in

00:54:40.590 --> 00:54:42.905
the past,
stocks are making higher

00:54:42.905 --> 00:54:47.811
returns than bonds,
and Social Security is paying

00:54:47.811 --> 00:54:53.119
people a fraction of the wages
of the young.

00:54:53.119 --> 00:54:56.500
So let me remind you of the
arguments.

00:54:56.500 --> 00:55:00.135
So the issue has come up
because Social Security is

00:55:00.135 --> 00:55:01.809
running out of money.
 

00:55:01.809 --> 00:55:03.780
So it came up because of this
problem.

00:55:03.780 --> 00:55:05.239
There's going to be a deficit.
 

00:55:05.239 --> 00:55:08.266
If we continue to pay people at
the same rules that we've used

00:55:08.266 --> 00:55:11.344
up until now we're not going to
be able to afford to do it much

00:55:11.344 --> 00:55:13.742
longer,
so we're going to have to lower

00:55:13.742 --> 00:55:16.010
what we pay the people going
forward,

00:55:16.010 --> 00:55:19.960
lower it in some clever way
like they don't get money until

00:55:19.960 --> 00:55:21.050
they're older.
 

00:55:21.050 --> 00:55:24.360
Instead of 65 make them wait
until 70, or do something like

00:55:24.360 --> 00:55:25.730
that to pay them less.
 

00:55:25.730 --> 00:55:27.679
That's one way of balancing
things.

00:55:27.679 --> 00:55:30.440
And because we're going to have
to make changes like that,

00:55:30.440 --> 00:55:33.059
that's why the whole issue of
Social Security has come up,

00:55:33.059 --> 00:55:37.402
and now deeper thinkers are
questioning the whole idea of

00:55:37.402 --> 00:55:38.800
Social Security.
 

00:55:38.800 --> 00:55:42.215
So let me just remind you that
America was ahead of everyone in

00:55:42.215 --> 00:55:45.519
the world when we created Social
Security under Roosevelt.

00:55:45.519 --> 00:55:47.230
Nobody had anything like it.
 

00:55:47.230 --> 00:55:50.670
Then everybody in the rest of
the world gradually copied us,

00:55:50.670 --> 00:55:54.039
and now everybody's facing the
same problem we are,

00:55:54.039 --> 00:55:55.690
which we know why you have to
face it.

00:55:55.690 --> 00:55:59.284
You're giving away stuff to the
people at the beginning and so

00:55:59.284 --> 00:56:02.701
they're facing it by changing
Social Security in some crazy

00:56:02.701 --> 00:56:05.351
way or another,
and we haven't changed anything

00:56:05.351 --> 00:56:06.829
at all,
but obviously we have to,

00:56:06.829 --> 00:56:09.226
and the question is how should
we change it and what's the

00:56:09.226 --> 00:56:10.110
right thing to do.
 

00:56:10.110 --> 00:56:13.023
And just to remind you,
again, of the issues,

00:56:13.023 --> 00:56:16.865
the Democrats and Republicans
seem to be totally opposed to

00:56:16.865 --> 00:56:17.860
each other.
 

00:56:17.860 --> 00:56:21.945
The Democrats say, "Oh,
we want to continue to give

00:56:21.945 --> 00:56:27.030
people who have done poorly in
their lives a better deal on

00:56:27.030 --> 00:56:31.500
Social Security because we want
to redistribute.

00:56:31.500 --> 00:56:32.969
We want to help the poor."
 

00:56:32.969 --> 00:56:34.965
The Republicans,
actually some of them agree

00:56:34.965 --> 00:56:36.731
with that,
but some of them don't agree

00:56:36.731 --> 00:56:38.737
with that,
but anyway, even the ones who

00:56:38.737 --> 00:56:41.702
agree that's not the most
important thing they think of in

00:56:41.702 --> 00:56:42.690
Social Security.
 

00:56:42.690 --> 00:56:45.978
Then the Democrats say,
"Social Security is so

00:56:45.978 --> 00:56:49.860
important because we're sharing
risks across generations.

00:56:49.860 --> 00:56:55.827
If the next generation has poor
wages so they end up down here

00:56:55.827 --> 00:56:59.206
with bad wages,
you know, the economy takes a

00:56:59.206 --> 00:57:02.329
turn south with bad wages,
then the old people should

00:57:02.329 --> 00:57:03.768
suffer along with them.
 

00:57:03.768 --> 00:57:06.889
And if the young do better with
high wages because things went

00:57:06.889 --> 00:57:09.601
up then the old should also get
better Social Security

00:57:09.601 --> 00:57:11.800
dividends,"
and that's what the current

00:57:11.800 --> 00:57:13.079
situation promises.
 

00:57:13.079 --> 00:57:17.440
It's also indexed according to
inflation, all right,

00:57:17.440 --> 00:57:22.402
so once you retire then you're
protected against changes in

00:57:22.402 --> 00:57:23.599
inflation.
 

00:57:23.599 --> 00:57:25.313
And then another important
thing of Democrats,

00:57:25.313 --> 00:57:27.219
you don't have an opportunity
to make a mistake.

00:57:27.219 --> 00:57:29.945
If you invest in stocks and
stuff like that and the stock

00:57:29.945 --> 00:57:32.766
market suddenly collapses you're
not going to lose money in

00:57:32.766 --> 00:57:35.735
Social Security because Social
Security depends on the wage of

00:57:35.735 --> 00:57:38.960
the next generation,
and that moves much slower than

00:57:38.960 --> 00:57:39.639
the stock.
 

00:57:39.639 --> 00:57:41.329
The Republicans,
on the other hand,

00:57:41.329 --> 00:57:43.070
say, "This is just
terrible.

00:57:43.070 --> 00:57:45.628
Nobody knows what their
property rights are in Social

00:57:45.628 --> 00:57:46.170
Security.
 

00:57:46.170 --> 00:57:48.552
No one actually understands how
much money they're getting when

00:57:48.552 --> 00:57:49.090
they're old.
 

00:57:49.090 --> 00:57:52.168
They just know now it's going
to be bad compared to what

00:57:52.168 --> 00:57:55.248
they're paying in taxes,
but you don't even know what it

00:57:55.248 --> 00:57:57.039
is, so how can that be good?
 

00:57:57.039 --> 00:58:00.170
It's not transparent,
but not only that,

00:58:00.170 --> 00:58:02.719
whatever you think it is now
it's going to turn out to be

00:58:02.719 --> 00:58:05.179
worse because in ten years
somebody's going to say,

00:58:05.179 --> 00:58:06.489
'Oh, the system's not balanced.
 

00:58:06.489 --> 00:58:09.909
We have to delay benefits or
something to put it back into

00:58:09.909 --> 00:58:11.719
balance,
and we're going to take away

00:58:11.719 --> 00:58:13.690
what you thought you were going
to get.'"

00:58:13.690 --> 00:58:15.239
So Republicans say,
"That's horrible.

00:58:15.239 --> 00:58:18.280
Nobody knows really exactly
what it is, and they get an idea

00:58:18.280 --> 00:58:20.755
of what it might be,
but it could always be taken

00:58:20.755 --> 00:58:21.219
away.
 

00:58:21.219 --> 00:58:24.159
Really what they want to know
is, 'What's the value of my

00:58:24.159 --> 00:58:26.889
Social Security account,
and I want it to be mine.

00:58:26.889 --> 00:58:30.340
I can also then tell what the
redistribution is.

00:58:30.340 --> 00:58:33.463
If I know what I'm paying in
taxes and I know the value of

00:58:33.463 --> 00:58:36.807
the benefits I'm getting I can
see that my taxes are much more

00:58:36.807 --> 00:58:37.960
than my benefits.
 

00:58:37.960 --> 00:58:40.833
And if I happen to be a nice
guy and think it's a good idea

00:58:40.833 --> 00:58:42.369
to have redistribution,
fine.

00:58:42.369 --> 00:58:44.230
But if I'm a bad,
you know, not a bad guy,

00:58:44.230 --> 00:58:46.492
if I just don't believe in that
much redistribution I should be

00:58:46.492 --> 00:58:48.719
aware of it and have the chance
to vote against it.'"

00:58:48.719 --> 00:58:53.030
Also, a key thing is these
Republicans say,

00:58:53.030 --> 00:58:55.050
"People should get equity
like returns,

00:58:55.050 --> 00:58:57.360
not this wages of the next
generation,

00:58:57.360 --> 00:58:58.630
those grow slowly.
 

00:58:58.630 --> 00:59:01.530
Stocks might have a much higher
return on average.

00:59:01.530 --> 00:59:04.244
People should get equity like
return, so let's put them in the

00:59:04.244 --> 00:59:05.179
stock market."
 

00:59:05.179 --> 00:59:07.869
And then Republicans think
choice is always great.

00:59:07.869 --> 00:59:10.367
Even if people make mistakes
it's their own mistake,

00:59:10.367 --> 00:59:11.739
so let them make mistakes.
 

00:59:11.739 --> 00:59:14.449
So those are the opposite sides
of the argument.

00:59:14.449 --> 00:59:18.434
They seem totally at odds with
each other and impossible to

00:59:18.434 --> 00:59:19.260
reconcile.
 

00:59:19.260 --> 00:59:22.090
So I want to now tell you my
plan.

00:59:22.090 --> 00:59:24.659
So everyone's got the problem
straight.

00:59:24.659 --> 00:59:28.208
We're running out of money and
the philosophies of the two

00:59:28.208 --> 00:59:31.570
groups seem to be totally
opposed, so what should we do

00:59:31.570 --> 00:59:32.380
about it?
 

00:59:32.380 --> 00:59:36.818
All right, so my plan,
in five minutes because I want

00:59:36.818 --> 00:59:41.340
to end with Black-Scholes,
my plan in five minutes is,

00:59:41.340 --> 00:59:44.500
okay, to make a few
observations.

00:59:44.500 --> 00:59:47.463
First of all,
yes it's true that you get a

00:59:47.463 --> 00:59:50.717
higher return on stocks than you
get on bonds,

00:59:50.717 --> 00:59:52.960
but you face a higher risk.
 

00:59:52.960 --> 00:59:54.829
So it's not like you get it for
free.

00:59:54.829 --> 00:59:56.739
It's a bigger risk.
 

00:59:56.739 --> 00:59:59.679
So that's number one.
 

00:59:59.679 --> 01:00:02.721
So no, actually,
point zero is you've still got

01:00:02.721 --> 01:00:06.688
the problem because you gave
money to all those people in the

01:00:06.688 --> 01:00:08.052
'40s,
and the '50s,

01:00:08.052 --> 01:00:09.570
and the '60s,
and the '70s.

01:00:09.570 --> 01:00:10.599
That money is gone.
 

01:00:10.599 --> 01:00:13.860
We've essentially borrowed to
give them money and somebody's

01:00:13.860 --> 01:00:15.409
got to pay back that debt.
 

01:00:15.409 --> 01:00:17.230
And so there's no way around
that.

01:00:17.230 --> 01:00:20.552
There's this huge 17 trillion
dollar debt hanging out there

01:00:20.552 --> 01:00:23.820
that we have to pay back and you
can't get around that.

01:00:23.820 --> 01:00:26.005
So putting the money into
equities, or wherever you put

01:00:26.005 --> 01:00:27.909
the money there's still that
tremendous debt.

01:00:27.909 --> 01:00:30.514
Now the question is--so you
can't just make the problem go

01:00:30.514 --> 01:00:32.889
away by saying that equities
have a higher return.

01:00:32.889 --> 01:00:36.387
Bonds also have a higher return
than the return people are

01:00:36.387 --> 01:00:39.641
getting on Social Security
because the Social Security

01:00:39.641 --> 01:00:43.324
return includes the tax that
you're paying to make up for the

01:00:43.324 --> 01:00:44.920
original generation.
 

01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:47.518
So that's the first thing.
 

01:00:47.518 --> 01:00:53.369
So the next thing is maybe it's
not such a big difference,

01:00:53.369 --> 01:00:58.547
this equities and not equities,
because notice in this model

01:00:58.547 --> 01:01:02.702
when the stock is paying higher,
when the stock dividends are

01:01:02.702 --> 01:01:04.079
higher,
2 instead of 1,

01:01:04.079 --> 01:01:06.070
the price of stocks goes up.
 

01:01:06.070 --> 01:01:08.436
That's a great return from the
stock market,

01:01:08.436 --> 01:01:10.969
but the wages were also higher
here as well.

01:01:10.969 --> 01:01:14.550
So in fact I claim that in the
long run,

01:01:14.550 --> 01:01:17.036
and it's amazing that the
Republicans haven't noticed

01:01:17.036 --> 01:01:19.434
this,
in the long run over 30 or 40

01:01:19.434 --> 01:01:23.117
years it's obvious that the
stock market and wages are

01:01:23.117 --> 01:01:24.090
correlated.
 

01:01:24.090 --> 01:01:27.990
I mean, if the stock market
collapses that's disaster for

01:01:27.990 --> 01:01:32.518
America and you can be sure the
wages are going to go down too.

01:01:32.518 --> 01:01:35.389
If our stock market's booming
and America's incredibly

01:01:35.389 --> 01:01:38.478
successful it's a sure thing
that in 40 years if the stock

01:01:38.478 --> 01:01:41.673
market is just booming along
wages are going to be higher as

01:01:41.673 --> 01:01:42.268
well.
 

01:01:42.268 --> 01:01:46.773
So if you get the wages of the
generation 30 years from now in

01:01:46.773 --> 01:01:50.760
the Democratic plan you're
actually getting equity like

01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:53.867
returns,
but you're getting an advantage

01:01:53.867 --> 01:01:56.429
which is that the wages move
slowly.

01:01:56.429 --> 01:01:59.610
So although the stocks are
bouncing up and down,

01:01:59.610 --> 01:02:03.657
so somebody who retires in the
year 2007 if he held stock and

01:02:03.657 --> 01:02:07.369
sold it when he retired he could
get a huge pension,

01:02:07.369 --> 01:02:10.788
where someone who retired in
2008 and sold the stock just

01:02:10.788 --> 01:02:14.389
when he retired he would be
crushed because the stock market

01:02:14.389 --> 01:02:15.610
lost 50 percent.
 

01:02:15.610 --> 01:02:18.628
So that will never happen if
you just pay according to wages

01:02:18.628 --> 01:02:20.420
because they're much more
stable.

01:02:20.420 --> 01:02:23.731
But wages in the long run are
correlated with stocks in the

01:02:23.731 --> 01:02:24.360
long run.
 

01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:26.690
In the short run they just
don't fluctuate at much.

01:02:26.690 --> 01:02:29.340
So what is my plan?
 

01:02:29.340 --> 01:02:31.746
So those are just some
preliminary observations and

01:02:31.746 --> 01:02:32.949
I'll give you the plan.
 

01:02:32.949 --> 01:02:35.340
Then as I said this is
obviously controversial.

01:02:35.340 --> 01:02:39.239
I think I've identified the
problem in a scientific way.

01:02:39.239 --> 01:02:44.523
That is, everyone would agree
with me if they knew enough

01:02:44.523 --> 01:02:46.581
economics,
but now my plan,

01:02:46.581 --> 01:02:49.860
even people who do know as much
as me might disagree with me,

01:02:49.860 --> 01:02:55.000
but this is what I would--okay
so here's the plan.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:56.684
As I said, other plans just
say, "Well,

01:02:56.684 --> 01:02:57.349
things are bad.
 

01:02:57.349 --> 01:02:59.599
Let's just keep the same
system."

01:02:59.599 --> 01:03:01.239
So there are two basic ideas.
 

01:03:01.239 --> 01:03:04.054
The Democratic idea is,
"Let's just keep adjusting

01:03:04.054 --> 01:03:04.889
at the margin.
 

01:03:04.889 --> 01:03:07.670
We'll make up for it by giving
people money later.

01:03:07.670 --> 01:03:09.239
We'll do all kinds of things
like that.

01:03:09.239 --> 01:03:11.677
Maybe we'll raise some tax,
reduce some benefits,

01:03:11.677 --> 01:03:13.050
balance the system."
 

01:03:13.050 --> 01:03:16.043
The Republicans want to junk
the whole thing and privatize

01:03:16.043 --> 01:03:18.577
and let people,
you know, force them to save,

01:03:18.577 --> 01:03:21.480
but put it in the stock market
in their own account.

01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:26.260
Now, here's my plan.
 

01:03:26.260 --> 01:03:32.769
I don't have time to talk about
Bush's plan.

01:03:32.769 --> 01:03:33.570
So here's my plan.
 

01:03:33.570 --> 01:03:36.626
Number one, the fact that we
gave all this money away to

01:03:36.626 --> 01:03:40.389
people in the '40s,
and '50s, and '60s and '70s,

01:03:40.389 --> 01:03:45.012
why should that be the
responsibility of the workers

01:03:45.012 --> 01:03:45.829
today?
 

01:03:45.829 --> 01:03:48.429
I mean, our government decided
it was a good idea.

01:03:48.429 --> 01:03:51.849
Roosevelt and Frances Perkins
decided we had to rescue the old

01:03:51.849 --> 01:03:54.405
of the '40s,
and our Congresses kept that up

01:03:54.405 --> 01:03:57.838
for the next 20 or 30 years even
though the old weren't in such

01:03:57.838 --> 01:03:59.489
dire shape,
but they kept it up.

01:03:59.489 --> 01:04:00.800
Maybe that was a good idea.
 

01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:03.909
It's probably a very good idea,
but because we have that huge

01:04:03.909 --> 01:04:06.862
debt why should workers be the
only people responsible for

01:04:06.862 --> 01:04:08.210
paying back that debt?
 

01:04:08.210 --> 01:04:11.987
I would start by imposing a
legacy tax on everybody,

01:04:11.987 --> 01:04:15.248
not for Social Security,
just for the debt we

01:04:15.248 --> 01:04:19.250
accumulated by giving it to
those old generations.

01:04:19.250 --> 01:04:22.360
So I believe that would be
something like 1 percent.

01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:25.449
I wrote 2 to 3 percent,
but I think it's closer to 1

01:04:25.449 --> 01:04:27.570
percent, actually,
on all income.

01:04:27.570 --> 01:04:31.088
If I did it on all income it
would be like 1 percent and that

01:04:31.088 --> 01:04:34.139
fund would pay off for the
Social Security legacy.

01:04:34.139 --> 01:04:39.351
So then if we were starting the
system afresh how should we do

01:04:39.351 --> 01:04:39.780
it?
 

01:04:39.780 --> 01:04:42.773
And some countries like Chile
decided they're going to start

01:04:42.773 --> 01:04:43.230
afresh.
 

01:04:43.230 --> 01:04:46.422
So how should we start afresh
having gotten rid of this old

01:04:46.422 --> 01:04:48.570
debt that was hanging over our
heads?

01:04:48.570 --> 01:04:56.170
Well, what would I do?
 

01:04:56.170 --> 01:04:59.219
I would have what I call
Progressive Personal Accounts.

01:04:59.219 --> 01:05:02.938
So I like all the Republican
ideas of knowing what you've

01:05:02.938 --> 01:05:06.260
got, making it yours,
and making it transparent.

01:05:06.260 --> 01:05:09.706
I think that's all an extremely
good idea, but why should it be

01:05:09.706 --> 01:05:12.710
that that comes from putting
your money into stocks?

01:05:12.710 --> 01:05:14.362
I mean, stocks,
this is an old fashioned

01:05:14.362 --> 01:05:15.929
security and it's incredibly
risky.

01:05:15.929 --> 01:05:18.018
From one year to the next it
totally changes.

01:05:18.018 --> 01:05:23.320
I like the idea of indexing
something to wages.

01:05:23.320 --> 01:05:26.672
So I want to create a new
security that I called Personal

01:05:26.672 --> 01:05:28.768
Annuitized Average Wage
Security.

01:05:28.768 --> 01:05:31.672
So what this does,
this is a security that just

01:05:31.672 --> 01:05:35.523
pays proportional to the wage in
the whole country at the year

01:05:35.523 --> 01:05:36.469
you retire.
 

01:05:36.469 --> 01:05:40.097
So whenever you earn money on
Social Security--I'm running out

01:05:40.097 --> 01:05:43.429
of time so I'm going to skip
over this pretty quickly.

01:05:43.429 --> 01:05:46.139
So if you earn 1 dollar and you
pay,

01:05:46.139 --> 01:05:48.920
let's say, 12 percent in Social
Securities taxes,

01:05:48.920 --> 01:05:54.416
that income,
I'm going to say that's your

01:05:54.416 --> 01:05:57.219
income,
it's your 12 percent.

01:05:57.219 --> 01:06:00.898
You're going to be forced to
save it, and what you're forced

01:06:00.898 --> 01:06:03.079
to do is to buy these
securities.

01:06:03.079 --> 01:06:06.503
So it's a new kind of security
that pays proportional to the

01:06:06.503 --> 01:06:06.909
wage.
 

01:06:06.909 --> 01:06:10.219
So it might pay 1 percent of
the average wage.

01:06:10.219 --> 01:06:12.686
So it would pay 12 cents here,
3 cents here,

01:06:12.686 --> 01:06:14.579
and 3 quarters of a cent there.
 

01:06:14.579 --> 01:06:18.003
That's the wage in the economy
and it would pay 1 percent of

01:06:18.003 --> 01:06:18.409
that.
 

01:06:18.409 --> 01:06:21.702
And how much of it would you
get to buy, as much as you could

01:06:21.702 --> 01:06:24.226
afford to buy with your
security, with your tax

01:06:24.226 --> 01:06:25.159
contribution.
 

01:06:25.159 --> 01:06:29.489
Now, that almost replicates the
current system.

01:06:29.489 --> 01:06:32.922
The only difference is that it
doesn't replicate the current

01:06:32.922 --> 01:06:35.889
system, there's nothing
progressive about it yet.

01:06:35.889 --> 01:06:38.570
So what I would do is I would
make it a progressive tax.

01:06:38.570 --> 01:06:42.230
If you're making a hugely high
income I wouldn't give you the

01:06:42.230 --> 01:06:43.389
whole 12 percent.
 

01:06:43.389 --> 01:06:44.460
I would take part of it.
 

01:06:44.460 --> 01:06:47.335
And if you're making a really
low income I would have the

01:06:47.335 --> 01:06:49.340
government subsidize it a little
bit.

01:06:49.340 --> 01:06:51.907
So instead of getting 12
percent of your low income you'd

01:06:51.907 --> 01:06:53.559
get a little more than 12
percent.

01:06:53.559 --> 01:06:57.192
If you had a high income your
12 percent tax the government

01:06:57.192 --> 01:07:00.949
would take 1 of those 12 away
from you and you'd only have 11

01:07:00.949 --> 01:07:04.518
percent that you got to put in
your personal account.

01:07:04.518 --> 01:07:06.630
Now, but it has a tremendous
advantage,

01:07:06.630 --> 01:07:09.371
this system,
which is that if you can price

01:07:09.371 --> 01:07:11.744
the PAAWS,
if you know what the market

01:07:11.744 --> 01:07:14.739
price of PAAWS is then you're
balancing the system,

01:07:14.739 --> 01:07:17.503
because every time you hand
somebody money you don't make

01:07:17.503 --> 01:07:20.565
some crazy promise that when you
get to be old I'm going to pay

01:07:20.565 --> 01:07:23.380
you such and such dollars like
the current system is.

01:07:23.380 --> 01:07:26.047
You're letting the guy,
or the woman,

01:07:26.047 --> 01:07:29.795
let's say, who's working;
she is buying her own Social

01:07:29.795 --> 01:07:30.980
Security benefits.
 

01:07:30.980 --> 01:07:35.389
So the benefits have an equal
value to what she's paying for.

01:07:35.389 --> 01:07:38.880
So you've balanced the system.
 

01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:42.331
The legacy tax you got rid of
by having the tax on everybody

01:07:42.331 --> 01:07:45.262
of 1 or 2 percent,
and the balancing the system

01:07:45.262 --> 01:07:48.789
going forward is occurring
because you're forcing people to

01:07:48.789 --> 01:07:51.099
buy their Social Security
benefits.

01:07:51.099 --> 01:07:53.206
So anyway that's my,
in a nutshell,

01:07:53.206 --> 01:07:53.949
my system.
 

01:07:53.949 --> 01:07:56.851
And the last thing is how are
you going to get PAAWS priced by

01:07:56.851 --> 01:07:57.469
the market?
 

01:07:57.469 --> 01:07:59.956
Well, I'm going to get the
market to trade them,

01:07:59.956 --> 01:08:02.974
and I think that would be a
tremendous boon to the economy

01:08:02.974 --> 01:08:04.880
if we had these securities paid.
 

01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:06.929
Why is that?
 

01:08:06.929 --> 01:08:08.570
So how would I do that?
 

01:08:08.570 --> 01:08:12.130
I'd force everybody to invest
only in PAAWS,

01:08:12.130 --> 01:08:14.360
which I claim are like stocks
in the long run,

01:08:14.360 --> 01:08:15.889
but in the short run they're
less risky,

01:08:15.889 --> 01:08:17.569
so it's a better investment
vehicle,

01:08:17.569 --> 01:08:21.074
but they'd have to sell exactly
10 percent of their PAAWS into

01:08:21.074 --> 01:08:22.922
the market,
and with that 10 percent of

01:08:22.922 --> 01:08:25.359
money they could hold stocks or
whatever else they wanted to,

01:08:25.359 --> 01:08:29.070
and those 10 percent would all
be pooled together and traded in

01:08:29.070 --> 01:08:29.850
the market.
 

01:08:29.850 --> 01:08:33.381
And the market then would have
an idea of--a new instrument to

01:08:33.381 --> 01:08:36.448
price what they think future
wages are going to be.

01:08:36.448 --> 01:08:39.283
So anybody giving a pension
plan that's indexed to future

01:08:39.283 --> 01:08:42.420
wages would know what the market
price of those things are,

01:08:42.420 --> 01:08:44.470
so it would dramatically help
pension plans as well.

01:08:44.470 --> 01:08:49.238
Anyway, that's my idea for
Social Security.

01:08:49.238 --> 01:08:54.768
So I have four minutes left and
I want to end with one last

01:08:54.768 --> 01:08:59.439
thought, one last idea,
which is Black-Scholes.

01:08:59.439 --> 01:09:02.989
Now, we've already done
Black-Scholes in a few problem

01:09:02.989 --> 01:09:03.460
sets.
 

01:09:03.460 --> 01:09:06.890
So what is the idea of
Black-Scholes?

01:09:06.890 --> 01:09:09.939
It's just like the idea of the
example we gave.

01:09:09.939 --> 01:09:13.604
By the way, if you do come next
week and you want to question me

01:09:13.604 --> 01:09:17.153
about my Social Security plan
and criticize it I'd be thrilled

01:09:17.153 --> 01:09:20.351
to be criticized because you
can't learn anything unless

01:09:20.351 --> 01:09:23.609
you're criticized and I think I
can defend it too.

01:09:23.609 --> 01:09:26.684
But anyhow, this is an idea
which obviously hasn't caught on

01:09:26.684 --> 01:09:29.029
yet because Social Security
reform stopped.

01:09:29.029 --> 01:09:30.760
We've got worse problems to
worry about,

01:09:30.760 --> 01:09:33.655
but if we get through this
crisis the very next thing on

01:09:33.655 --> 01:09:36.710
Obama's agenda is going to be
reforming Social Security.

01:09:36.710 --> 01:09:39.729
So I'm ready.
 

01:09:39.729 --> 01:09:43.170
So let me just end with
Black-Scholes.

01:09:43.170 --> 01:09:48.420
So in 1972 Black and Scholes
wrote a famous paper.

01:09:48.420 --> 01:09:49.720
And what did they do?
 

01:09:49.720 --> 01:09:52.939
They started off by saying,
this model we had,

01:09:52.939 --> 01:09:56.909
you see, of the stock market
which follows a geometric random

01:09:56.909 --> 01:09:58.609
walk,
it can go up by a certain

01:09:58.609 --> 01:10:00.670
percentage or down by a certain
percentage.

01:10:00.670 --> 01:10:02.479
We've used that with interest
rates too.

01:10:02.479 --> 01:10:05.078
They can go up or down by a
certain percentage.

01:10:05.078 --> 01:10:08.109
Here the stocks can go up or
down by a certain percentage.

01:10:08.109 --> 01:10:11.738
We saw that you could solve
models like that very easily.

01:10:11.738 --> 01:10:14.591
So Black and Scholes,
Fischer Black who is a great

01:10:14.591 --> 01:10:17.618
economist, and Myron Scholes who
won the Nobel Prize,

01:10:17.618 --> 01:10:20.470
but was not as mathematical as
Fischer Black.

01:10:20.470 --> 01:10:23.100
Anyway, he started the hedge
fund Long Term Capital.

01:10:23.100 --> 01:10:25.538
Myron Scholes was one of the
people.

01:10:25.538 --> 01:10:30.506
They looked in 1972 at the
returns each day on the S&amp;P

01:10:30.506 --> 01:10:34.078
500, and they binned them up
like this.

01:10:34.078 --> 01:10:37.903
So here are the number of times
the return was between .47

01:10:37.903 --> 01:10:40.050
percent and some other number.
 

01:10:40.050 --> 01:10:43.319
And then they compared that to
a normally distributed random

01:10:43.319 --> 01:10:46.699
variable, and look how close to
normally distributed it is.

01:10:46.699 --> 01:10:47.689
It's practically like that.
 

01:10:47.689 --> 01:10:51.220
So this thing over here is
exactly normally distributed,

01:10:51.220 --> 01:10:55.189
and this is the frequency graph
of what actually happened that

01:10:55.189 --> 01:10:57.122
year,
incredibly close to normally

01:10:57.122 --> 01:10:57.779
distributed.
 

01:10:57.779 --> 01:11:00.386
If you take the cumulative
occurrence of each thing and

01:11:00.386 --> 01:11:03.430
compare it to the normal it's
incredibly close to the normal.

01:11:03.430 --> 01:11:05.978
So they said, "Gosh,
isn't it great,

01:11:05.978 --> 01:11:09.211
this model of things going up
or down by a certain percentage

01:11:09.211 --> 01:11:11.002
every year,
maybe with a drift,

01:11:11.002 --> 01:11:14.109
that's exactly the model the
stock market seems to follow,

01:11:14.109 --> 01:11:17.442
and maybe interest rates follow
that sort of model too,"

01:11:17.442 --> 01:11:20.328
and that's why we've worked
with all those models.

01:11:20.328 --> 01:11:24.863
Well, it turns out if you make
those assumptions and then you

01:11:24.863 --> 01:11:29.095
try to solve for option prices
you can do it very quickly

01:11:29.095 --> 01:11:32.488
through some formula,
which I'm not going to have

01:11:32.488 --> 01:11:33.390
time to present.
 

01:11:33.390 --> 01:11:36.069
It'll only take one minute,
but I'm going to skip that.

01:11:36.069 --> 01:11:37.319
So what happened then?
 

01:11:37.319 --> 01:11:41.380
So this was the second high
point of, you know,

01:11:41.380 --> 01:11:46.500
there's the CAPM model and then
the Black-Scholes model.

01:11:46.500 --> 01:11:49.350
You've done problems with
Black-Scholes now in the problem

01:11:49.350 --> 01:11:51.698
set to figure out the value of a
call option.

01:11:51.698 --> 01:11:54.484
So I'm just pointing out that
you could put it in a spread

01:11:54.484 --> 01:11:56.880
sheet like I've done,
which will be on the web.

01:11:56.880 --> 01:12:01.100
And you can do daily returns,
and fix the standard deviation

01:12:01.100 --> 01:12:03.289
and stuff,
and do backward induction

01:12:03.289 --> 01:12:05.617
incredibly quickly,
and figure out the value of the

01:12:05.617 --> 01:12:07.819
call option,
even get a closed form formula

01:12:07.819 --> 01:12:10.234
for it,
and then explain why call

01:12:10.234 --> 01:12:13.470
option prices have the form that
they do.

01:12:13.470 --> 01:12:15.860
So it was a great triumph and
it relied on things being

01:12:15.860 --> 01:12:16.880
normally distributed.
 

01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:18.710
I'm down to 30 seconds.
 

01:12:18.710 --> 01:12:21.328
So what happened?
 

01:12:21.328 --> 01:12:25.713
If you do the same thing
recently--so you do exactly the

01:12:25.713 --> 01:12:30.097
same thing and bin everything up
like Fischer Black did,

01:12:30.097 --> 01:12:32.408
not in 1972--shit,
sorry.

01:12:32.408 --> 01:12:35.902
Not in 1972 but the last five
years, say, they only did one

01:12:35.902 --> 01:12:37.890
year, but you do the last five.
 

01:12:37.890 --> 01:12:40.753
Actually I did this a couple
years ago, so from seven years

01:12:40.753 --> 01:12:41.890
ago to two years ago.
 

01:12:41.890 --> 01:12:44.863
If the pink thing is normally
distributed and we do the same

01:12:44.863 --> 01:12:46.779
binning that Black and Scholes
did,

01:12:46.779 --> 01:12:50.072
look everyday at what the
return is and stick it in a bin

01:12:50.072 --> 01:12:53.350
and just do the frequency thing,
what do you see?

01:12:53.350 --> 01:12:57.378
You see that there are a lot
more times where in reality the

01:12:57.378 --> 01:13:00.766
move was very small,
but there are a lot more times

01:13:00.766 --> 01:13:03.189
in reality where the move was
very big.

01:13:03.189 --> 01:13:06.920
So this is precisely what you
call a fat tail,

01:13:06.920 --> 01:13:10.162
that you get smaller moves than
the normally distributed ones

01:13:10.162 --> 01:13:13.350
but also bigger moves than the
normally distributed ones.

01:13:13.350 --> 01:13:14.810
So you can have some big
negative moves.

01:13:14.810 --> 01:13:17.939
And so we know we've had some
huge negative shocks.

01:13:17.939 --> 01:13:22.703
So I'm ending now with this
thought that finance produced

01:13:22.703 --> 01:13:26.894
remarkable theories,
remarkably precise predictions,

01:13:26.894 --> 01:13:31.074
and for decades at a time it
seemed those were borne out in

01:13:31.074 --> 01:13:31.939
practice.
 

01:13:31.939 --> 01:13:35.505
But then looking back 50 years
later or 30 years later on these

01:13:35.505 --> 01:13:38.841
discoveries we see that they
don't do quite as well as they

01:13:38.841 --> 01:13:40.970
seem to be doing at first
glance.

01:13:40.970 --> 01:13:44.032
So something's missing in the
theory, and I think the subject

01:13:44.032 --> 01:13:46.890
is so exciting because it's so
connected to the world.

01:13:46.890 --> 01:13:50.850
Everybody talks about finance
nowadays.

01:13:50.850 --> 01:13:55.359
Anyone in the world is spending
half their time thinking about

01:13:55.359 --> 01:13:59.795
finance and the theory is still
up in the air because the old

01:13:59.795 --> 01:14:02.899
classics of the theory no longer
hold.

01:14:02.899 --> 01:14:05.595
And so it's an exciting time to
be developing a new theory and

01:14:05.595 --> 01:14:07.538
maybe you'll think about it in
the future.

01:14:07.538 --> 01:14:09.051
So I'll see you,
some of you,

01:14:09.051 --> 01:14:09.699
next week.
 

01:14:09.699 --> 01:14:15.000

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:10.860
- Hello and good morning everybody.

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.600
- [Students] Good morning.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:17.050
- Today our agenda is
going to be threefold.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.400
I'm going to review some
of the central themes

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.040
of the course to begin with,

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:29.040
then I'm gonna talk about four
paths not taken as a way of,

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:30.870
rather than giving

00:00:32.635 --> 00:00:36.100
a mechanical summary of
the previous 25 lectures,

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.960
to pick out

00:00:37.808 --> 00:00:40.470
the four central areas where,

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:42.340
as I said early on in the course,

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.690
we're gonna be paying attention to paths

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.280
that might've been
taken that weren't taken

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.140
when they were a scope for choice,

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.850
and then finally we're gonna end

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.800
with agendas for democratic reform,

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.090
the sorts of political reforms

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.750
that would make it more likely

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.940
that the kind of policies I have been

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.800
discussing in the last two lectures

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.890
could actually be successfully pursued,

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.800
but let's go all the way back
first of all to September.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.050
There were really two central

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:17.400
motivating questions of the course.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.800
The first is,

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.990
how did we get from the
euphoria and optimism

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.440
that we say at the end of the Cold War

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.130
to the politics of fear and resentment

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.330
that has swept so much of the
democratic world since 2016?

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:33.770
And then, secondly,

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.053
what are the prospects for a
better politics going forward?

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.580
So if we reflect on those two questions

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.070
from the standpoint of
what we have been doing

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.610
over the past three and a half months,

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.093
I think there are two related
answers to the first question.

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:55.623
The first one is,

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.860
especially in the period
of what I was calling

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.060
the early post-Cold War era

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.070
that is up to the financial crisis,

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.230
geopolitical arrogance

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:11.780
and uncritical embrace
of neoliberalism at home

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.340
and the Washington consensus abroad.

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.200
If you wanted the bumper sticker

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.690
for the geopolitical arrogance,

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.290
there are plenty of candidates,
but I think this anonymous,

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.860
what turned out to be Karl Rove quotation

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.160
that I showed you earlier is probably

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.067
the winning candidate when he said,

00:02:32.067 --> 00:02:34.347
"We're an empire now, and when we act,

00:02:34.347 --> 00:02:36.267
"we create our own reality.

00:02:36.267 --> 00:02:38.327
"And while you're studying that reality,

00:02:38.327 --> 00:02:39.837
"judiciously, as you will,

00:02:39.837 --> 00:02:42.917
"we'll act again, creating
other new realities,

00:02:42.917 --> 00:02:44.727
"which you can study too,

00:02:44.727 --> 00:02:46.927
"and that's how things will sort out.

00:02:46.927 --> 00:02:50.457
"We are history's actors
and you, all of you,

00:02:50.457 --> 00:02:53.670
"will be left just to study what we do,"

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:54.610
and this was

00:02:56.965 --> 00:02:58.570
in October, 2004,

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:01.200
in the run-up to the election

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.860
in which George W. Bush would be reelected

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.490
and unusually with increased

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:11.070
majorities on Capitol Hill.

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:14.650
Usually the president's party loses seats

00:03:17.022 --> 00:03:19.063
in his reelection bid,

00:03:20.733 --> 00:03:24.597
but he actually increased
his majority in 2002 as well.

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:29.860
So there was some reason for
that arrogance you might think

00:03:30.757 --> 00:03:34.530
and it certainly informed their policies

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.800
in the international arena.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.410
If you wanted the winning
bumper sticker candidate

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.830
for the uncritical acceptance

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:48.570
of neoliberalism at home

00:03:49.944 --> 00:03:52.170
and the Washington consensus abroad,

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.160
it has to be this statement
by Alan Greenspan.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.430
- Have looked to the self
interest of lending institutions

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.910
to protect shareholders'
equity, myself especially,

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.763
are in a state of shocked disbelief.

00:04:07.428 --> 00:04:08.400
- As you will recall,

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.870
we played the longer
excerpt of that interview

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:17.420
in which he admitted that
his models had broken down,

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:20.610
and I think that that again captures

00:04:21.689 --> 00:04:26.340
the uncritical acceptance of
the neoliberalism at home,

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.243
Washington consensus abroad.

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:35.160
If I talk about the second big answer

00:04:37.466 --> 00:04:38.630
to the first question,

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:41.020
it has to be the failure to take account

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.200
of the long-term changes in the national

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.143
and global political economies.

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.060
Just to remind you again here of some

00:04:52.332 --> 00:04:53.782
of the key points about this,

00:04:54.884 --> 00:04:56.680
this is a slide I showed you

00:05:02.951 --> 00:05:05.870
of the mirror image of
the graphs depicting

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:08.820
the decline of industrial jobs over,

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:11.390
this is 26

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:14.070
OEDC countries between 1960

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:15.620
and 2018

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:20.040
and the fragmentation
of political parties,

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.880
the weakening of political parties,

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:23.883
and I told you a story about that.

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:28.200
As left-of-center parties

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.820
became less able

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:34.930
to defend unionized workers,

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:36.620
they defended them less well,

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:39.460
and they defended fewer and fewer of them

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:43.330
and so workers hemorrhaged
to other parties

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:46.490
as in, say in Germany to Die Linke,

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:49.760
the far-left Marxist party and The Greens,

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:50.970
and eventually

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:57.650
to populist parties such as the
Alternative fur Deutschland.

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:02.200
This in turn led to fragmentation
of parties on the right

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:07.200
as they saw opportunistic
possibilities of picking up seats

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:10.890
and so we get this very substantial

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:13.890
fragmentation of political parties,

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:17.030
which is gonna have an
impact on their capacity

00:06:18.025 --> 00:06:21.010
to protect the interests
of workers over time.

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:23.750
This reflects a much broader trend.

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:26.030
This is the picture from the U.S.

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:29.350
Of the decline of union membership.

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:31.840
As industrial jobs have gone away,

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:34.380
unions have gotten smaller and smaller,

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:37.270
particularly private-sector unions,

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:40.360
and we saw how that coincided

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:43.530
with the growth of inequality,

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:48.203
the hollowing out and stagnation
of middle-class incomes,

00:06:52.648 --> 00:06:54.610
and the declining fortunes
of the middle-class,

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:58.950
both in absolute terms as they

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:01.640
faced harder and harder difficulties

00:07:03.014 --> 00:07:04.760
in achieving the same real income,

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:07.960
often having to go from
one to two earners,

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:10.080
being decreasingly able

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:13.600
to afford college for their children,

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.790
and often having to finance their children

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:18.080
well into adulthood.

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:22.420
So this is a broader context
where we've seen this impact

00:07:23.295 --> 00:07:25.930
of globalization,
technology, and slow growth.

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:28.340
We have aging populations in many

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:29.980
of these developed countries,

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:33.940
which has put increasing
stress on their fiscal states

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:37.370
as ever shrinking employed,

00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:38.203
what we call

00:07:41.747 --> 00:07:45.320
the non-dependent part of the population

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:49.250
is supporting an ever
increasing dependent population.

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:51.580
The collapse of the corporatist consensus

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:54.320
between business and labor that underpin

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:57.110
many of the social
democratic welfare states

00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:59.470
in the post-World War II era

00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:04.100
which really depended on
relatively large, stable,

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:08.390
labor-oriented parties
making deals with relatively

00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:11.770
large stable business-oriented parties

00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:15.190
that were then blessed
through the political system

00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:18.920
and maintain the social democratic order.

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:20.920
All of that has been weakening shrinking

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:26.210
and so we have had this
fragmentation of parties.

00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:28.480
All of this has made it much harder

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:31.130
for governments to govern and has led

00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:33.620
voters to make demands for reform,

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:37.387
some of which we have talked
about in a previous lecture

00:08:37.387 --> 00:08:40.800
and some more of which we
are gonna talk about today,

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:44.877
and it's led to the rise
of anti-system parties.

00:08:44.877 --> 00:08:48.710
One of the if you like
tragedies of the politics

00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:51.690
of the last several decades is the extent

00:08:53.127 --> 00:08:55.910
to which political reforms have been

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:58.610
fixing things that were not broken.

00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:01.510
We saw this I think
particularly dramatically

00:09:02.556 --> 00:09:05.850
in the United Kingdom in the 1970s.

00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:07.510
Aside from the war decades,

00:09:07.510 --> 00:09:11.190
the 1970s were surely the most challenging

00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:14.410
economic decade that Britain experienced,

00:09:14.410 --> 00:09:16.030
although they certainly were not alone.

00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:20.280
The '70s were very difficult
here because of the oil shocks

00:09:21.199 --> 00:09:25.083
from the Yom Kippur War in 1973.

00:09:25.083 --> 00:09:28.210
The advent of stagflation is hitherto

00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:32.110
an unexperienced combination

00:09:33.579 --> 00:09:37.400
of high inflation and low growth,

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:40.920
job stagnation, high
inflation, high unemployment,

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:43.393
very difficult to manage,

00:09:45.505 --> 00:09:47.447
and as Anthony King's excellent book

00:09:47.447 --> 00:09:49.570
"The British Constitution" argues

00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:52.370
in was this period
which led people to say,

00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:54.710
the political system is failing us

00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:56.983
and we need to start reforming it.

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:01.640
Very comparable developments occurred

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:05.080
in many of the other
capitalist democracies.

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:09.610
So when the economy is going
badly and if the sources

00:10:09.610 --> 00:10:13.020
of the pain are not addressed
by the political system,

00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:16.020
people all want to attack
the political system

00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:20.027
and say it's failing us,
even if the problems,

00:10:20.027 --> 00:10:24.113
as was the case with much of
the stagflation of the 1970s,

00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:27.853
were actually exogenous.

00:10:29.275 --> 00:10:32.470
So I think these are the two big answers

00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:33.933
if you like to course:

00:10:35.746 --> 00:10:38.997
the arrogance and uncritical acceptance

00:10:40.275 --> 00:10:43.280
of the dominance of the American's

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:46.110
model of democratic capitalism

00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:47.950
and the American approach

00:10:47.950 --> 00:10:51.240
to international
geopolitics on the one hand,

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:53.820
and the failure to appreciate and think

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:56.180
about the implications of these

00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:59.580
long-term changes in
the political economy,

00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:01.790
which had indeed been going on since

00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:04.190
well before the end of the Cold War

00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:08.780
and would play themselves out
in the subsequent decades.

00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:11.510
So I think those are
the two central answers

00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:14.890
that I would give us to the question

00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:17.883
that I posed at the start of the course.

00:11:18.810 --> 00:11:21.318
What I wanna do now, though,

00:11:21.318 --> 00:11:22.900
is think about what might have happened?

00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:25.330
What could've been done differently?

00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:29.940
And I wanna pick out as a way
of summarizing and reviewing

00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:32.710
much of the material that we have covered

00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:37.460
four particular types of
path, taken or not taken,

00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:39.100
where there was relatively

00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:42.070
unusual

00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:46.610
scope for choice, for
agency, as I'm gonna call it.

00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:49.600
You might recall that
earlier in the semester

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:53.850
I said that we need to think
about political outcomes

00:11:53.850 --> 00:11:56.550
by reference to three of my I words.

00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:59.620
So I have a penchant for I words.

00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:03.830
I said one was institutions,
one is interest,

00:12:03.830 --> 00:12:06.336
and that one is ideals,

00:12:06.336 --> 00:12:09.643
or we might say ideas or ideologies,

00:12:13.748 --> 00:12:16.500
and the constellations
of interest, ideals,

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:20.360
and institutions shape what can be done.

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:24.280
You might think that
the capacity for agency

00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:28.410
as I'm calling it here is
sometimes more constrained

00:12:28.410 --> 00:12:30.430
and sometimes less constrained

00:12:32.024 --> 00:12:33.513
by the interests, ideas,

00:12:36.311 --> 00:12:40.920
and institutions that
structure a given situation.

00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:43.150
So if we think about the Cold War,

00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:45.400
this was a period in which there was

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:48.250
very little capacity for agency

00:12:50.188 --> 00:12:52.190
because the interests on the two sides

00:12:52.190 --> 00:12:54.860
were pretty much baked in.

00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:56.660
The coalitions,

00:12:56.660 --> 00:12:59.650
at least until Nixon's opening to China

00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:03.540
started to split the Communist
coalition in the Cold War,

00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:06.560
but at least until that point,

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:08.555
the interest were really,

00:13:08.555 --> 00:13:11.720
we had these two snarling

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:13.853
coalitions of forces,

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:17.990
institutions were largely

00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:20.140
either baked into the conflict

00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:22.890
as with the Warsaw Pact and NATO,

00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:25.810
or irrelevant, as with the United Nations,

00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:28.370
which was largely beside the point

00:13:29.812 --> 00:13:33.090
in such a realist-dominated conflict,

00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:35.230
and then ideas and ideologies were

00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:38.480
also largely baked into the conflict.

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:43.480
George Kennan had sort of
summed up the American attitude

00:13:43.776 --> 00:13:45.140
that it wasn't worth trying

00:13:46.748 --> 00:13:49.300
to argue the merits with
the Soviets because they

00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:53.970
were locked into their
own ideological prism

00:13:53.970 --> 00:13:56.720
and they certainly saw
the West in the same way,

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:57.660
that it was all

00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:01.270
bourgeois can't coming out of radio

00:14:01.270 --> 00:14:04.010
through Europe or wherever it might be.

00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:09.010
So the Cold War was an era in
which the capacity for agency,

00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:10.840
to actually change things,

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:13.103
was very constrained that, if you like,

00:14:14.883 --> 00:14:15.716
that triangle

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:20.200
of constraints was very small,

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:23.650
but there are times and
I mentioned this to you

00:14:23.650 --> 00:14:25.590
right at the beginning of the course

00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:30.400
when those constraints can
loosen up, when suddenly,

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:34.630
we know now from the
divide-a-dollar story, for example,

00:14:34.630 --> 00:14:37.420
coalitions can start to break apart

00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:42.140
and unlikely coalitions
might begin to form.

00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:46.021
We saw this for example
in the South Africa case

00:14:46.021 --> 00:14:50.500
where the traditional
coalitions completely fell apart

00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:53.540
and the ANC and the Inkatha Freedom

00:14:56.264 --> 00:14:58.220
and the national party government formed

00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:01.200
a kind of coalition against Inkatha to get

00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:04.740
the new rules adopted.

00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:05.890
We also saw

00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:10.300
in the post-Cold War era and
also in the South Africa case

00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:14.510
that ideologies and ideas
can suddenly become freed up.

00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:17.260
So the hard right wing Afrikaners

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:19.400
ended up making an alliance

00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:25.030
with Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party

00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:28.130
and would be photographed
standing together in ways

00:15:29.116 --> 00:15:30.970
that would've been unthinkable in terms

00:15:30.970 --> 00:15:35.970
of the Afrikaner ideologies
of even a few years prior,

00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:38.200
and institutions can change.

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:42.400
We will see how the
institutions did indeed change

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:44.850
once the Cold War was over.

00:15:44.850 --> 00:15:47.380
We saw that there was a scope both

00:15:48.801 --> 00:15:51.330
for the reorientation of
existing institutions,

00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:53.230
most notably, NATO,

00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:56.160
and also the creation of new institutions

00:15:57.545 --> 00:16:00.820
such as the system of rules enacted

00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:05.103
for the responsibility to
protect in a post-Cold War era.

00:16:07.004 --> 00:16:08.640
So there are circumstances

00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:11.410
in which this triangle becomes larger,

00:16:11.410 --> 00:16:12.480
and suddenly

00:16:15.027 --> 00:16:17.670
it's possible to do things differently

00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:21.670
and there are real choices
for the players at the time,

00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:23.663
and of course that window,

00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:27.350
something of a mixed metaphor
here of triangles and windows,

00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:29.830
but that window of opportunity

00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:32.420
doesn't stay open indefinitely.

00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:33.700
It will close again

00:16:35.709 --> 00:16:36.880
as things solidify

00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:41.680
and it becomes harder to make changes

00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:44.923
that might've been easier
at a different time.

00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:47.480
We've seen this somewhat,

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:52.040
but classic example is if
there's a lot of dissatisfaction

00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:54.630
and a country changes its electoral system

00:16:56.890 --> 00:17:01.890
that then new politicians get
elected under the new rules,

00:17:01.890 --> 00:17:03.620
so they are gonna be very disinclined

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:06.380
to change it again in the future.

00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:09.760
So as I said the 1970s create a lot

00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:11.930
of dissatisfaction with existing

00:17:11.930 --> 00:17:14.710
electoral institutions in
many parts of the world,

00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:16.150
changes were made,

00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:20.673
but then it becomes harder
to change them again.

00:17:21.590 --> 00:17:26.590
So let's start with the first
of these paths not taken

00:17:26.860 --> 00:17:30.680
and I think that the

00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:31.790
most important

00:17:33.010 --> 00:17:33.843
one here,

00:17:33.843 --> 00:17:35.540
certainly the first one I talked

00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:37.810
about during the Cold War was

00:17:39.398 --> 00:17:43.440
the decision to expand
NATO after the Cold War

00:17:44.370 --> 00:17:47.430
to consume what would eventually be

00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:49.740
all of the Warsaw Pact countries

00:17:52.717 --> 00:17:56.080
and even make overtures
to Georgia and Ukraine.

00:17:59.218 --> 00:18:02.673
It's worth going back
to thinking about this.

00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:06.720
How this started,

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:09.770
this first came onto the agenda

00:18:09.770 --> 00:18:12.260
when the Berlin wall came down and it was

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:16.330
obvious that Germany was gonna be reunited

00:18:16.330 --> 00:18:19.540
and of course Gorbachev was very worried

00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:21.450
that this would mean East Germany

00:18:21.450 --> 00:18:24.130
would become a member of NATO,

00:18:24.130 --> 00:18:26.830
and East Germany had been a
member of the Warsaw Pact.

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:30.763
Very substantial assurances,

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:34.310
there was gossip about it at the time,

00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:38.670
but we now can see from
declassified documents

00:18:38.670 --> 00:18:41.850
that it wasn't just Kohl

00:18:41.850 --> 00:18:45.610
and Baker who promised
Gorbachev that there would be

00:18:46.533 --> 00:18:51.130
no expansion of NATO into
the former Soviet empire,

00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:53.030
but many others,

00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:55.290
you can see here on the
bottom of the slide,

00:18:55.290 --> 00:18:59.120
all gave assurances to that effect

00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:00.790
in early

00:19:01.651 --> 00:19:02.484
1990,

00:19:06.309 --> 00:19:08.130
and this was a promise that was

00:19:08.130 --> 00:19:11.993
gone back on first in the
Clinton administration.

00:19:13.654 --> 00:19:14.840
In 1998,

00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:19.840
the Clinton administration took
the decision to expand NATO

00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:24.303
to include Hungary, Poland,
and the Czech Republic.

00:19:27.771 --> 00:19:30.740
The decision was made in about 1996,

00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:33.020
but it actually came on board

00:19:34.496 --> 00:19:35.360
in 1998.

00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:37.240
In May of that year,

00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:40.453
the journalist, Tom Friedman,
called up George Kennan,

00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:43.740
the architect of containment

00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:46.327
about whom you heard in earlier lectures,

00:19:46.327 --> 00:19:49.730
and he asked him for
his opinion about this

00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:54.060
and it's worth paying some
attention to what Kennan said.

00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:57.357
He said, "I think it's the
beginning of a new Cold War.

00:19:57.357 --> 00:20:01.017
"I think the Russians will
gradually react quite adversely

00:20:01.017 --> 00:20:03.127
"and it will affect their policies.

00:20:03.127 --> 00:20:05.927
"I think it's a tragic mistake.

00:20:05.927 --> 00:20:08.367
"There was no reason for this whatsoever.

00:20:08.367 --> 00:20:10.527
"No one was threatening anyone else.

00:20:10.527 --> 00:20:13.210
"This expansion would make
the Founding Fathers,"

00:20:13.210 --> 00:20:14.960
of course he's alluding to the fact here

00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:18.897
that the Founding Fathers
opposed all permanent alliances,

00:20:18.897 --> 00:20:20.297
"would make the Founding Fathers

00:20:20.297 --> 00:20:22.377
"of this country turn
over in their graves.

00:20:22.377 --> 00:20:25.797
"We have signed up to protect
a whole series of countries,

00:20:25.797 --> 00:20:28.527
"even though we have neither the resources

00:20:28.527 --> 00:20:31.287
"nor the intention to do
so in any serious way.

00:20:31.287 --> 00:20:35.917
"NATO expansion was simply a
lighthearted action by a Senate

00:20:35.917 --> 00:20:40.077
"that has no real interest
in foreign affairs."

00:20:41.116 --> 00:20:44.480
So this was a prescient observation

00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:48.830
that this was not going to go
over well with the Russians

00:20:50.709 --> 00:20:52.560
as by this time it was of course

00:20:53.657 --> 00:20:56.180
Yeltsin in charge of Russia

00:20:57.472 --> 00:20:58.710
and he was

00:20:58.710 --> 00:21:01.610
deeply troubled by it.

00:21:01.610 --> 00:21:04.800
Indeed there's more to
the prehistory of this

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:08.090
than I told you during
the original lecture

00:21:11.478 --> 00:21:12.877
in that during the late

00:21:15.727 --> 00:21:20.163
1980s, Gorbachev had made
several overtures to the West.

00:21:21.151 --> 00:21:23.950
He, three times brought
up the prospect of,

00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:25.960
he thought at that time the Soviet Union

00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:28.670
was not gonna fall apart, it
wasn't being thought about,

00:21:28.670 --> 00:21:31.803
but that they might themselves join NATO.

00:21:33.290 --> 00:21:36.110
There was some discussion
of this with Western leaders

00:21:40.407 --> 00:21:42.960
and it was sort of
deferred into the future

00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:47.130
and Yeltsin too had, in print,

00:21:47.130 --> 00:21:50.410
said that it was

00:21:50.410 --> 00:21:51.490
a long-term

00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:57.490
plan or policy of the Soviet
Union eventually to join NATO.

00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:00.400
Indeed even in 2000,

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:04.223
when Yeltsin came to power in Russia,

00:22:06.878 --> 00:22:07.961
he approached

00:22:09.404 --> 00:22:13.100
the Clinton administration
about the possibility of Russia,

00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:17.030
not only of Russia not only joining NATO,

00:22:17.030 --> 00:22:19.150
but also the European Union,

00:22:19.150 --> 00:22:22.610
and they had been brushed off by this.

00:22:22.610 --> 00:22:26.230
If you're interested
in more granular depth

00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:28.400
on these proposals and rejections

00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:30.170
and proposals and rejection,

00:22:30.170 --> 00:22:34.520
if you Google up the
journalist, Vladimir Pozner,

00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:36.173
a very interesting,

00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:40.560
you would never believe he's actually

00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:43.853
French by birth, French journalist,

00:22:45.071 --> 00:22:47.460
but who's worked for many years

00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:52.016
in the U.S. and now works in Russia,

00:22:52.016 --> 00:22:54.610
he has an excellent video.

00:22:54.610 --> 00:22:57.130
It was actually a lecture he gave at Yale.

00:22:57.130 --> 00:22:59.230
I think he was probably a
Poynter Fellow or something.

00:22:59.230 --> 00:23:03.780
If you Google up Vladimir
Pozner at Yale University,

00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:05.860
you'll find this lecture on YouTube,

00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:10.360
really a riveting account
of the missed opportunities

00:23:12.296 --> 00:23:16.110
to incorporate Russia
into the New World order

00:23:16.110 --> 00:23:18.240
in a way that would have made them

00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:21.110
much more likely to be
part of the solution

00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:23.250
than part of the problem,

00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:26.300
and of course this isn't
just retrospective.

00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:31.280
In 1991, when the Soviet
Union finally fell apart,

00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:35.410
Mitterrand, who was at that
time the president of France,

00:23:35.410 --> 00:23:37.647
said, "We should just disband NATO."

00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:42.960
The French, as we saw
playing out yesterday,

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:46.880
the French have a long history
of skepticism toward NATO.

00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:48.430
de Gaulle didn't really like it

00:23:48.430 --> 00:23:51.560
and actually he kicked
NATO troops out of France

00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:53.970
on several occasions and took France

00:23:53.970 --> 00:23:58.360
out of the command-and-control systems.

00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:00.930
So it's never been a lot of love lost

00:24:00.930 --> 00:24:03.650
between the French and
NATO and indeed they

00:24:03.650 --> 00:24:07.330
insisted on having their own
independent nuclear deterrent,

00:24:07.330 --> 00:24:10.230
which NATO was designed to prevent

00:24:10.230 --> 00:24:12.513
the incentive to do that sort of thing.

00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:15.440
So when the current

00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:17.710
French president said NATO is brain-dead,

00:24:17.710 --> 00:24:21.260
he's walking into a well-worn tradition

00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:23.320
of France's skepticism towards NATO,

00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:25.773
but there it is, there
was a path not taken.

00:24:27.379 --> 00:24:30.810
Mitterrand could have prevailed,

00:24:30.810 --> 00:24:33.320
and it does seem like
there was surprisingly

00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:36.480
little discussion of the possibility

00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:39.023
of creating a different world,

00:24:41.131 --> 00:24:44.497
that instead that decision
that was taken in 1996

00:24:45.390 --> 00:24:50.250
and implemented in 1998
as I detailed to you

00:24:50.250 --> 00:24:52.780
was followed up by the gradual inclusion

00:24:54.679 --> 00:24:56.350
of all of the NATO countries

00:24:56.350 --> 00:25:00.300
and overtures to Georgia and Ukraine,

00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:04.210
which had a lot to do
with the Soviet policy

00:25:04.210 --> 00:25:08.290
toward Georgia in 2008
when they went in there

00:25:09.561 --> 00:25:11.730
and their attitude toward Ukraine

00:25:11.730 --> 00:25:15.560
once the election in 2014 came around

00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:20.560
and it was clear that their
base at Sevastopol was

00:25:21.410 --> 00:25:25.320
going to be jeopardized
and that was a real concern

00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:30.030
if Ukraine had joined NATO
and/or the European Union.

00:25:30.030 --> 00:25:31.503
So you could ask yourself

00:25:31.503 --> 00:25:34.640
sort of in the domain of
counterfactual history,

00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:39.130
what kind of geopolitics
might we have today

00:25:39.130 --> 00:25:42.720
if that was not the
choice that had been made

00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:47.720
and instead either the
incorporation of the Soviet Union,

00:25:48.140 --> 00:25:53.140
and then Russia into the
new geopolitical order

00:25:53.369 --> 00:25:56.030
as a full partner and participant,

00:25:56.030 --> 00:25:59.300
or the disbanding of NATO which after all

00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:02.400
was a defensive alliance against a foe

00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:06.330
that had no longer
existed and was gonna turn

00:26:06.330 --> 00:26:09.670
into an alliance in search of a mission

00:26:09.670 --> 00:26:11.390
which we saw playing out

00:26:13.242 --> 00:26:16.470
rather depressingly in the Libyan conflict

00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:20.543
about which I'll have more
to say in a few minutes.

00:26:21.456 --> 00:26:25.270
So that's a clear case
of a path not taken.

00:26:25.270 --> 00:26:27.810
Of course we don't know what the path

00:26:27.810 --> 00:26:31.090
would have yielded if
we had gone down that,

00:26:31.090 --> 00:26:35.300
but it would've made the New World order,

00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:39.910
once America's capacity
for unilateral action

00:26:39.910 --> 00:26:42.620
was revealed to be chimerical

00:26:42.620 --> 00:26:47.010
after the debacles in
Afghanistan and then Iraq,

00:26:47.010 --> 00:26:49.410
it would've made it much less likely

00:26:49.410 --> 00:26:52.350
that geopolitical
relations would've settled

00:26:52.350 --> 00:26:54.700
back into something not that different

00:26:55.830 --> 00:26:59.100
from what they had looked
like during the Cold War.

00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:00.700
So I think Kennan,

00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:03.700
who had been prescient
about so much in his life

00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:06.900
when he had advised against Vietnam War,

00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:07.880
when he had

00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:12.260
advised against militarizing NATO

00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:14.780
in the early years of the Cold War,

00:27:14.780 --> 00:27:16.010
was extremely

00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:21.050
prescient in 1998 in pointing out

00:27:21.050 --> 00:27:23.750
the folly of the Clinton administration

00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:27.820
in expanding NATO onto Russia's doorstep

00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:30.590
or beginning the expansion of NATO

00:27:30.590 --> 00:27:34.133
which would eventually extend
not only to Russia's doorstep,

00:27:35.613 --> 00:27:36.860
but to at least two of the former

00:27:36.860 --> 00:27:40.390
republics of the old Soviet Union.

00:27:40.390 --> 00:27:43.410
So a second path not taken

00:27:44.650 --> 00:27:47.360
also in the realm of geopolitics

00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:49.510
I put under the heading of the management

00:27:49.510 --> 00:27:54.510
of geopolitical crises and
humanitarian intervention,

00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:55.373
and here

00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:58.810
George Herbert Walker Bush

00:27:58.810 --> 00:28:03.220
really pointed the way to
a new containment regime

00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:05.960
in the first crisis after the Cold War

00:28:07.487 --> 00:28:10.523
when Saddam Hussein's Iraq invaded Kuwait.

00:28:11.910 --> 00:28:12.743
The question was:

00:28:12.743 --> 00:28:16.670
how would the international
community handle this?

00:28:16.670 --> 00:28:21.670
And the answer was essentially
a global containment regime

00:28:23.618 --> 00:28:25.430
that the bumper sticker for containment

00:28:25.430 --> 00:28:27.770
as I have said to you in earlier lectures

00:28:27.770 --> 00:28:31.053
is stop the bully without
becoming a bully yourself.

00:28:32.683 --> 00:28:34.600
So what did Bush do?

00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:35.433
First of all,

00:28:35.433 --> 00:28:39.300
he got authorization from the
international institutions

00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:43.490
as they then existed,
namely the Security Council.

00:28:43.490 --> 00:28:46.940
He put together a massive coalition

00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:49.840
that included very diverse players

00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:54.703
including every Arab
country except Jordan.

00:28:56.402 --> 00:28:58.253
He then expelled,

00:28:59.470 --> 00:29:04.371
with that coalition,
expelled Iraq from Kuwait,

00:29:04.371 --> 00:29:08.750
and against the advice of
many hawks in the U.S.,

00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:10.500
and particularly the neoconservatives

00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:13.459
who we talked about in an earlier lecture,

00:29:13.459 --> 00:29:17.200
he chose not to go for
regime change in Iraq,

00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:20.750
but instead essentially
create no-fly zones

00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:23.290
and buttoned-down the Iraqi regime

00:29:23.290 --> 00:29:28.073
and make it impossible for them
to threaten their neighbors.

00:29:29.159 --> 00:29:31.080
So if that had become the model

00:29:32.292 --> 00:29:33.340
for dealing

00:29:34.478 --> 00:29:36.740
with geopolitical crises

00:29:39.696 --> 00:29:41.790
in the wake of the end of the Cold War,

00:29:41.790 --> 00:29:44.500
we would again I think
be looking at a very

00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:48.580
different kind of geopolitical reality.

00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:49.780
Instead though

00:29:51.290 --> 00:29:54.950
George W. Bush abandoned
this with his unilateralism

00:29:56.250 --> 00:30:01.250
after 9/11 where he talked
about coalitions of the willing,

00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:04.810
forced countries to choose,

00:30:04.810 --> 00:30:07.890
if you're not with us,
you're with the terrorist.

00:30:07.890 --> 00:30:11.560
By the way the big impetus
for the expansion of NATO

00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:14.710
as I mentioned came about
because he wanted to get many

00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:18.890
East European countries to
commit to the war effort in Iraq

00:30:19.751 --> 00:30:22.180
and the quid pro quo for that was

00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:24.760
that they would be able to join NATO,

00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:28.220
which many of them did the following year.

00:30:28.220 --> 00:30:32.470
So the paths not taken
here in Afghanistan:

00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:34.890
the possibility which was advocated

00:30:34.890 --> 00:30:37.690
by some in the military at the time

00:30:37.690 --> 00:30:41.920
was to ignore the regime in Kabul

00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:42.860
when they refused

00:30:46.748 --> 00:30:49.650
to turn over Al Qaeda
and to close the camps

00:30:49.650 --> 00:30:52.403
and instead to have just gone in ourselves

00:30:53.898 --> 00:30:56.350
and finish the war with Al Qaeda.

00:30:56.350 --> 00:30:59.860
Instead because we were committed

00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:02.950
first of all to fighting
that war on the cheap,

00:31:02.950 --> 00:31:06.010
we wanted to fight it with
the Northern Alliance,

00:31:06.010 --> 00:31:07.477
and their agenda was regime change,

00:31:07.477 --> 00:31:11.310
and so by mission creed it
became America's agenda,

00:31:11.310 --> 00:31:14.140
saddling us with a puppet
regime that wouldn't

00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:16.750
be able to sustain itself into the future.

00:31:16.750 --> 00:31:18.150
The commanders on the ground

00:31:20.665 --> 00:31:22.130
were telling the White House

00:31:23.829 --> 00:31:26.710
before the end of 2002 that a deal

00:31:26.710 --> 00:31:29.450
would have to be made with the Taliban

00:31:31.248 --> 00:31:33.150
as the other forces were not gonna be

00:31:33.150 --> 00:31:36.810
sufficiently powerful
to govern the country.

00:31:36.810 --> 00:31:38.380
Again that was ignored

00:31:38.380 --> 00:31:42.139
and instead we created
a puppet government.

00:31:42.139 --> 00:31:43.500
"If you break it, you own it,"

00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:45.130
as Colin Powell once said.

00:31:45.130 --> 00:31:47.440
We then became responsible

00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:50.890
for the administration of this country

00:31:50.890 --> 00:31:54.490
which at some level continues to this day.

00:31:54.490 --> 00:31:56.980
We also failed to defeat

00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:03.760
Al Qaeda which escaped through
the mountains into Pakistan

00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:07.370
and indeed became the
staging area not only

00:32:08.346 --> 00:32:10.860
for future reconstitution of Al Qaeda,

00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:14.750
but also for the exiled Taliban government

00:32:14.750 --> 00:32:19.750
that would eventually work
its way back into Afghanistan.

00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:21.633
In Iraq,

00:32:23.180 --> 00:32:25.390
we failed to see

00:32:27.142 --> 00:32:29.450
that knocking off the regime in accordance

00:32:29.450 --> 00:32:34.200
with the desires of the
neoconservatives would first of all

00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:39.160
not produce a government that
was likely to be democratic,

00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:40.760
and even if democratic,

00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:43.110
would not necessarily produce a government

00:32:43.110 --> 00:32:45.790
that would be friendly
to the United States.

00:32:45.790 --> 00:32:48.960
We talked at some length about the naivety

00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:51.628
of the neoconservative view

00:32:51.628 --> 00:32:54.100
that if you just get
rid of authoritarianism

00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:56.290
that not only will democracy flourish,

00:32:56.290 --> 00:32:59.500
but it will be pro-American democracy.

00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:03.440
Neither of these things turns
out necessarily to be true

00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:06.740
and so they had their eyes firmly fixed

00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:08.440
on the Eastern European countries,

00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:10.340
which would all have pre-World War II

00:33:10.340 --> 00:33:11.830
histories of democracy.

00:33:11.830 --> 00:33:14.240
They would've done a lot better to look

00:33:16.551 --> 00:33:19.650
at the former Asiatic
Republics of the Soviet Union

00:33:19.650 --> 00:33:23.010
for what was likely to happen in a country

00:33:23.010 --> 00:33:26.070
like Iraq with its per capita income,

00:33:26.070 --> 00:33:28.300
its lack of a diversified economy

00:33:30.341 --> 00:33:32.680
or a middle class that was independent

00:33:34.876 --> 00:33:36.230
of the government's control

00:33:41.257 --> 00:33:44.590
of the gateway to wealth and prosperity.

00:33:47.038 --> 00:33:49.040
So we became embroiled instead

00:33:49.874 --> 00:33:52.503
in this ongoing conflict in Iraq.

00:33:54.216 --> 00:33:57.240
The other thing that they failed to see

00:33:57.240 --> 00:34:00.630
was that the capacity to defeat an army,

00:34:00.630 --> 00:34:03.600
we defeated the Iraqi army in four days,

00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:06.973
does not translate in the
capacity to govern a country.

00:34:08.194 --> 00:34:12.140
This is the fatal error of
thinking just because we

00:34:12.140 --> 00:34:14.970
are the most powerful
military in the world,

00:34:14.970 --> 00:34:17.710
we can knock off governments
and putting governments

00:34:17.710 --> 00:34:20.170
who will then be able to govern.

00:34:20.170 --> 00:34:23.463
There are many economies
of smallness in governing.

00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:26.370
You need street-level buy-in,

00:34:26.370 --> 00:34:28.280
you need street-level commitment

00:34:29.764 --> 00:34:31.340
from various broker groups

00:34:33.286 --> 00:34:35.870
and you need to empower

00:34:35.870 --> 00:34:38.920
local institutions,
which we had obliterated.

00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:41.943
We largely obliterated the army,

00:34:44.310 --> 00:34:47.100
the civil service and the police

00:34:47.100 --> 00:34:50.300
and it was not surprising
that that country would be

00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:52.990
headed for decades,

00:34:52.990 --> 00:34:56.233
more than a decade of chaos.

00:34:59.371 --> 00:35:02.240
So then we can think not
only of that tragedy,

00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:04.990
but the tragedy of responsibility

00:35:04.990 --> 00:35:08.323
to protect from Rwanda through Libya.

00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:11.940
Rwanda was the never again.

00:35:11.940 --> 00:35:14.100
We then had Kosovo and it seemed

00:35:14.100 --> 00:35:16.750
like a unilateral intervention.

00:35:16.750 --> 00:35:18.020
It was by NATO,

00:35:18.020 --> 00:35:19.680
again without the permission

00:35:21.889 --> 00:35:23.570
of the UN Security Council

00:35:23.570 --> 00:35:25.990
because the Russians and Chinese

00:35:25.990 --> 00:35:28.180
were supporting Serbian sides

00:35:28.180 --> 00:35:31.410
so there was no question of
international authorization.

00:35:31.410 --> 00:35:34.980
There was an intervention that
appeared to be successful,

00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:37.910
even though it provoked

00:35:39.580 --> 00:35:40.960
virulent attacks

00:35:42.503 --> 00:35:43.610
in the global south,

00:35:43.610 --> 00:35:45.680
from South Africa, from India,

00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:49.520
and from others as expansions
of Western imperialism.

00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:53.050
It provoked the African Union to declare

00:35:53.050 --> 00:35:56.410
that it had unilateral
authority to intervene

00:35:56.410 --> 00:35:59.180
in member countries on
humanitarian grounds,

00:35:59.180 --> 00:36:03.080
even though the UN Charter
extensively reserves

00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:05.490
that authority to the Security Council.

00:36:05.490 --> 00:36:08.940
So what we were doing
there was somewhat eroding

00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:11.630
the authority of the UN
and the Security Council.

00:36:11.630 --> 00:36:16.630
We saw how the UN tried to sort
of reign in and domesticate

00:36:16.890 --> 00:36:20.630
this idea of responsibility to protect

00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:25.500
by authorizing the Security
Council to authorize it,

00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:29.620
and then we saw the tragic
way it played out in Libya

00:36:31.673 --> 00:36:33.430
when the Obama administration,

00:36:33.430 --> 00:36:35.030
which was quite divided

00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:38.650
and against the advice of his generals

00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:43.010
but in the thrall of the ideology

00:36:43.010 --> 00:36:45.790
of responsibility to protect,

00:36:45.790 --> 00:36:48.400
being pressed by some
in the administration,

00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:50.320
and eventually Hillary Clinton

00:36:52.535 --> 00:36:54.930
at the behest of not very

00:36:56.820 --> 00:37:00.560
credible interests of
people who were looking

00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:03.290
to ensure oil concessions from what they

00:37:03.290 --> 00:37:05.500
thought was gonna be the new government,

00:37:05.500 --> 00:37:08.370
this whole doctrine became a smokescreen

00:37:11.002 --> 00:37:14.070
for knocking off the
Gadhafi regime, which then,

00:37:14.070 --> 00:37:16.433
because of what IR theorists

00:37:16.433 --> 00:37:19.313
call the moral hazard of intervention,

00:37:21.430 --> 00:37:24.120
became an accelerant
of the Syrian conflict

00:37:26.133 --> 00:37:29.660
as the Syrian demonstrators
against the Assad regime

00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:34.660
reasoned that if only

00:37:35.150 --> 00:37:38.630
they rose up, NATO would
come and help them too,

00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:40.090
which of course they didn't,

00:37:40.090 --> 00:37:42.430
and then the Assad regime came down

00:37:42.430 --> 00:37:45.434
on them like a ton of bricks,

00:37:45.434 --> 00:37:49.500
not to mention the collapse
of the Libyan state

00:37:50.870 --> 00:37:54.600
created an arms bizarre across
the whole of North Africa

00:37:56.583 --> 00:37:59.220
as many people made lots of money,

00:37:59.220 --> 00:38:01.160
and it also created a foothold

00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:04.493
by the way for Al Qaeda in Libya.

00:38:07.156 --> 00:38:08.653
So terrible tragedy,

00:38:09.797 --> 00:38:13.350
and this doctrine of the
responsibility to protect

00:38:13.350 --> 00:38:16.990
was essentially hijacked by American

00:38:18.290 --> 00:38:21.310
and its allies' unilateralism

00:38:21.310 --> 00:38:25.170
as expressed through this now

00:38:25.170 --> 00:38:27.960
NATO organization that had lost

00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:31.370
its raison d'etre and was becoming

00:38:31.370 --> 00:38:34.550
the self-appointed policeman of the world,

00:38:34.550 --> 00:38:38.330
which is unlikely to
win it much legitimacy,

00:38:38.330 --> 00:38:40.260
except among people

00:38:42.079 --> 00:38:45.437
whose acceptance of it was not needed.

00:38:46.590 --> 00:38:48.850
So you might ask yourself again,

00:38:48.850 --> 00:38:51.630
as with the expansion of NATO,

00:38:51.630 --> 00:38:54.140
what world might we be living in

00:38:54.140 --> 00:38:57.380
had the responsibility to protect doctrine

00:38:58.679 --> 00:39:02.990
not morphed into one
more piece of camouflage

00:39:02.990 --> 00:39:07.680
for the unilateralism that
had become so fashionable

00:39:09.950 --> 00:39:12.940
after the collapse of the Soviet Union,

00:39:12.940 --> 00:39:16.263
and particularly after 9/11?

00:39:19.152 --> 00:39:21.290
So that's a second area where there were

00:39:21.290 --> 00:39:24.050
real choices that could've
been made differently,

00:39:24.050 --> 00:39:26.730
but were not and have left the world

00:39:26.730 --> 00:39:30.150
in a much different place and the idea

00:39:30.150 --> 00:39:35.150
that responsibility to
protect could be rehabilitated

00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:39.580
now is extremely difficult
because the way it played out

00:39:39.580 --> 00:39:43.610
has been baked into the
conflict in the Middle East

00:39:43.610 --> 00:39:47.350
as it since evolved with Russia

00:39:47.350 --> 00:39:51.070
filling the gap in the Syrian Civil War

00:39:54.459 --> 00:39:58.850
and if you like my triangular
window of opportunity,

00:39:58.850 --> 00:40:00.680
to experiment with that doctrine

00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:03.373
having been dramatically shrunk.

00:40:06.090 --> 00:40:09.083
Paths taken and not taken by business.

00:40:11.130 --> 00:40:14.640
So here it's just worth
pausing to ask the question:

00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:16.670
why is business so important?

00:40:16.670 --> 00:40:19.070
Why focus on business?

00:40:19.070 --> 00:40:20.940
And the answer to that question is

00:40:22.642 --> 00:40:26.140
that once communism as an economic system

00:40:26.140 --> 00:40:28.113
has been taken off the table,

00:40:28.980 --> 00:40:31.933
capitalism essentially
is the only game in town.

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:35.410
There is no serious competitor,

00:40:35.410 --> 00:40:39.460
maybe not even a frivolous
competitor to capitalism.

00:40:39.460 --> 00:40:42.210
You think about Islamic fundamentalism.

00:40:42.210 --> 00:40:44.390
One thing Islamic states lack is

00:40:44.390 --> 00:40:46.630
any kind of political economy.

00:40:46.630 --> 00:40:48.270
If they have an economic theory,

00:40:48.270 --> 00:40:50.023
it comes from the 14th century.

00:40:51.350 --> 00:40:54.540
They have no conception
of an alternative way

00:40:54.540 --> 00:40:59.340
of running political
economy than capitalism.

00:40:59.340 --> 00:41:02.410
If you look at Islamic
fundamentalist countries

00:41:04.811 --> 00:41:08.940
such as Libya or Saudi
Arabia, they just do it badly.

00:41:10.790 --> 00:41:12.770
There's no alternative.

00:41:12.770 --> 00:41:14.963
Well, if there's no alternative out there,

00:41:16.194 --> 00:41:17.027
that means

00:41:18.278 --> 00:41:19.700
that capital is gonna be

00:41:19.700 --> 00:41:22.330
in a uniquely powerful position,

00:41:22.330 --> 00:41:26.950
particularly in this
world in which labor is

00:41:26.950 --> 00:41:31.140
weaker and weaker and
organized labor has shrunk.

00:41:31.140 --> 00:41:33.220
This is basically a Hirschman story

00:41:33.220 --> 00:41:36.410
that business can go anywhere
at the click of a mouse,

00:41:36.410 --> 00:41:39.590
capital can move anywhere
at the click of a mouse

00:41:40.577 --> 00:41:43.350
and labor has very high exit cost

00:41:43.350 --> 00:41:46.530
because you have to pack up
and move and find another job,

00:41:46.530 --> 00:41:48.193
and move your family and so on.

00:41:49.613 --> 00:41:52.100
So the differential capacity for exit

00:41:52.100 --> 00:41:54.650
between business and labor means

00:41:54.650 --> 00:41:57.010
that business is more and more important

00:41:57.010 --> 00:41:59.720
and the idea that informed some

00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:02.150
business elites during the new deal

00:42:05.737 --> 00:42:09.900
that we need to worry that
America's workers might conclude

00:42:09.900 --> 00:42:11.980
they have nothing to lose but their change

00:42:11.980 --> 00:42:15.090
ceases to be important because there isn't

00:42:15.090 --> 00:42:17.800
an alternative out there competing

00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:21.060
for the hearts and minds
of American workers.

00:42:21.060 --> 00:42:24.570
So businesses is now
in this unique position

00:42:25.899 --> 00:42:28.270
that it's hugely consequential.

00:42:28.270 --> 00:42:31.430
It's not really counteracted
any other interest.

00:42:31.430 --> 00:42:32.540
Maybe there are

00:42:32.540 --> 00:42:34.770
conflicts of interest
within business elites,

00:42:34.770 --> 00:42:37.800
but it's not really counteracted
by any other interest,

00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:42.360
and that means that unless
business is part of the solution,

00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:44.183
it's gonna be part of the problem.

00:42:46.883 --> 00:42:51.770
You could imagine a continuum
and ask yourself, a continuum.

00:42:51.770 --> 00:42:54.780
One is where you have
predatory capitalist class,

00:42:54.780 --> 00:42:56.120
as in Russia,

00:42:56.120 --> 00:42:57.710
and another would be if you have

00:42:57.710 --> 00:42:59.950
a very progressive capitalist class,

00:42:59.950 --> 00:43:02.450
as in some Nordic countries and has seem

00:43:02.450 --> 00:43:05.940
to be possibly happening in South Africa,

00:43:05.940 --> 00:43:08.523
at least during the 1980s.

00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:10.750
And then the questions become,

00:43:10.750 --> 00:43:14.560
so what makes it more likely
that business will move

00:43:17.490 --> 00:43:19.710
toward the progressive
end of the continuum

00:43:19.710 --> 00:43:24.133
rather than down toward the
predatory end of the continuum?

00:43:25.310 --> 00:43:27.623
So that's why business matters.

00:43:29.175 --> 00:43:30.008
Indeed,

00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:33.917
as we argue in my book
with Michael Graetz,

00:43:33.917 --> 00:43:35.720
"The Wolf at the Door"

00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:38.800
thinking about changes in social policy

00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:42.840
that are not gonna command
support from substantial amounts

00:43:44.099 --> 00:43:47.303
of business is probably a waste of time.

00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:50.940
So if we think about business in sort

00:43:52.060 --> 00:43:53.370
of under two headings,

00:43:53.370 --> 00:43:55.910
one we talked about some with the role

00:43:55.910 --> 00:43:57.600
of business in regime change,

00:43:57.600 --> 00:44:00.810
which we talked about in
relation to the Soviet Union

00:44:00.810 --> 00:44:05.400
and we talked also about it
in relation to South Africa,

00:44:05.400 --> 00:44:08.460
you can say two cheers for
the South African story,

00:44:08.460 --> 00:44:10.043
two, but not three.

00:44:10.043 --> 00:44:12.970
So the two cheers are

00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:17.210
devoted to the fact that in the 1980s,

00:44:17.210 --> 00:44:21.320
the South African business
elites did discern

00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:25.770
the possibility of both
facilitating regime change

00:44:25.770 --> 00:44:27.970
and influencing the ANC to think

00:44:29.193 --> 00:44:32.230
about how the world
economy was then operating

00:44:32.230 --> 00:44:35.100
and was gonna be
operating into the future.

00:44:35.100 --> 00:44:39.464
They became the kind of
handmaidens of the transition

00:44:39.464 --> 00:44:41.242
in that as I said business did

00:44:41.242 --> 00:44:43.100
encourage the South African transition.

00:44:43.100 --> 00:44:45.760
The old regime was falling apart.

00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:49.460
There was no question that
apartheid was unsustainable,

00:44:49.460 --> 00:44:50.910
but that didn't mean it was gonna

00:44:50.910 --> 00:44:53.450
have a transition to a democracy

00:44:53.450 --> 00:44:56.660
or that the transition
was going to be peaceful.

00:44:56.660 --> 00:44:59.970
It might well have been
replaced in a military coup,

00:44:59.970 --> 00:45:01.300
which people at the time,

00:45:01.300 --> 00:45:04.340
some feared it might have just become

00:45:04.340 --> 00:45:07.840
increasingly repressive
and cease to be even

00:45:09.670 --> 00:45:14.060
sort of quasi-democratic as it had been.

00:45:14.060 --> 00:45:16.610
It might have descended into a civil war,

00:45:16.610 --> 00:45:19.470
which by the 1990s had already erupted

00:45:19.470 --> 00:45:21.790
in the eastern part of the country.

00:45:21.790 --> 00:45:25.130
So what business did was a huge amount

00:45:25.130 --> 00:45:27.570
of very creative and intelligent work

00:45:27.570 --> 00:45:29.570
that we talked about in that case

00:45:31.582 --> 00:45:34.400
to broker the deals
and get the transition,

00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:37.290
keep it on track when it
seemed to be falling apart.

00:45:37.290 --> 00:45:39.570
And when it did finally fall apart,

00:45:39.570 --> 00:45:42.000
do the back channel negotiations

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:44.280
to produce an agreement and eventually

00:45:45.900 --> 00:45:47.630
the election in 1994.

00:45:47.630 --> 00:45:52.220
The reason I say two cheers
rather than three cheers is

00:45:53.434 --> 00:45:57.160
that thereafter South African
business did very little.

00:45:57.160 --> 00:46:01.620
It retreated into the sort
of normal stereotypical view

00:46:01.620 --> 00:46:04.640
of business that the business
of business is business

00:46:04.640 --> 00:46:07.680
and leave politics to the politicians.

00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:11.217
A few lone voices like
Christo Nel who said,

00:46:11.217 --> 00:46:16.030
"No, we should be actively
transforming our companies now,"

00:46:16.030 --> 00:46:18.300
before we are hit over
the head with what would

00:46:18.300 --> 00:46:21.340
eventually become black
economic empowerment

00:46:22.844 --> 00:46:25.260
and talk of seizing land and so on.

00:46:25.260 --> 00:46:30.150
Business should continue
to be ahead of that curve,

00:46:30.150 --> 00:46:32.900
so if you like shape that destiny

00:46:32.900 --> 00:46:36.080
rather than ending up being shaped by it.

00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:40.690
So we see this has played
out in the social indicators

00:46:40.690 --> 00:46:43.953
I showed you of South Africa today.

00:46:45.880 --> 00:46:49.380
The morals of Israel and Palestine story.

00:46:49.380 --> 00:46:51.520
Again there've been business groups

00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:53.820
that have tried to participate,

00:46:53.820 --> 00:46:57.480
but it's very difficult if
they don't have a K group.

00:46:57.480 --> 00:46:59.790
It's very difficult if they don't agree.

00:46:59.790 --> 00:47:02.320
It's very difficult if they don't

00:47:03.770 --> 00:47:06.450
show themselves to be willing to actually

00:47:06.450 --> 00:47:09.193
internalize some cost to achieve change.

00:47:10.220 --> 00:47:12.320
So the impasse group

00:47:13.470 --> 00:47:16.150
never really had an effect,

00:47:16.150 --> 00:47:18.560
but you can still see and we showed this

00:47:19.546 --> 00:47:20.510
with (mumbles) and SodaStream

00:47:23.941 --> 00:47:26.210
and some of the other
business interventions

00:47:26.210 --> 00:47:28.830
that I have talked about that business,

00:47:28.830 --> 00:47:30.300
individual business leaders,

00:47:30.300 --> 00:47:32.660
if there's no capacity

00:47:32.660 --> 00:47:37.020
to do things on a regime-level
scale can nonetheless be

00:47:37.020 --> 00:47:40.580
thinking about ways of
changing things at the margin

00:47:42.557 --> 00:47:44.740
so that even if this is parried

00:47:46.540 --> 00:47:48.510
as legitimating the status quo,

00:47:48.510 --> 00:47:51.350
it can be legitimating a status quo

00:47:51.350 --> 00:47:54.440
that is itself evolving over time.

00:47:54.440 --> 00:47:57.730
This was Douglas Ray's
idea of utility drift

00:47:57.730 --> 00:48:00.790
that I talked to you about and could

00:48:01.930 --> 00:48:05.200
put business in a position
to be a constructive force

00:48:06.402 --> 00:48:10.113
when the other things
line up more propitiously.

00:48:13.470 --> 00:48:16.740
We have ongoing projects looking
at this in other contexts.

00:48:16.740 --> 00:48:20.510
We have a project looking
at this in Columbia

00:48:20.510 --> 00:48:22.910
where various Colombian business groups,

00:48:22.910 --> 00:48:24.580
I didn't have time to share this

00:48:24.580 --> 00:48:26.373
with you during the lecture,

00:48:27.217 --> 00:48:28.820
but I have for decades actually

00:48:28.820 --> 00:48:30.900
been involved behind the scenes

00:48:30.900 --> 00:48:32.920
in negotiations between various

00:48:32.920 --> 00:48:34.957
Colombian governments and the FARC

00:48:35.830 --> 00:48:38.050
and were instrumental in the agreement

00:48:38.050 --> 00:48:40.390
that was eventually settled.

00:48:40.390 --> 00:48:44.660
Unlike South African business
after the transition,

00:48:44.660 --> 00:48:46.080
there are a number of interesting

00:48:46.080 --> 00:48:49.000
Colombian business enterprises aimed

00:48:50.056 --> 00:48:52.840
at trying to incorporate the FARC

00:48:55.176 --> 00:48:58.700
into the new legitimate
economy and revivify

00:49:00.424 --> 00:49:02.840
it in ways that will make backsliding

00:49:04.460 --> 00:49:05.760
less likely.

00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:08.410
By no means sure that they'll succeed,

00:49:08.410 --> 00:49:12.110
but they perceive the possibility
for agency at the margin

00:49:13.231 --> 00:49:15.300
and/or trying to do that.

00:49:15.300 --> 00:49:19.010
One might think of Syria
where the Civil War

00:49:19.010 --> 00:49:21.670
is going to be over in the next year.

00:49:21.670 --> 00:49:26.070
There's a huge amount of
expatriate Syrian capital

00:49:26.070 --> 00:49:27.710
parked in various countries

00:49:29.328 --> 00:49:33.370
and convening groups may
well have the opportunity

00:49:33.370 --> 00:49:37.430
of thinking about how it might
be constructively deployed

00:49:37.430 --> 00:49:39.610
in rebuilding what's probably the most

00:49:39.610 --> 00:49:42.490
badly devastated country by Civil War,

00:49:42.490 --> 00:49:44.653
at least since Rwanda.

00:49:47.249 --> 00:49:50.140
Business and domestic politics.

00:49:50.140 --> 00:49:51.330
Here I would say

00:49:53.892 --> 00:49:55.250
that the missed opportunity

00:49:55.250 --> 00:49:57.330
with transitional adjustment assistance

00:49:57.330 --> 00:50:01.840
is symptomatic of a bigger
sense that business has

00:50:01.840 --> 00:50:04.680
not seen it as their problem to worry

00:50:04.680 --> 00:50:07.380
about the fortunes of workers.

00:50:07.380 --> 00:50:11.520
As I said to you in that lecture, in 1962,

00:50:11.520 --> 00:50:12.830
the Kennedy administration,

00:50:12.830 --> 00:50:16.180
it actually lined up the AFL-CIO

00:50:23.139 --> 00:50:26.640
to support tariff reduction
as a quid for the quo being

00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:28.870
transitional adjustment assistance.

00:50:28.870 --> 00:50:33.100
By the time business finally
decided that was a good idea,

00:50:33.100 --> 00:50:35.782
the unions had abandoned it

00:50:35.782 --> 00:50:38.783
and were no longer supportive of it,

00:50:39.930 --> 00:50:42.380
and that was because the

00:50:42.380 --> 00:50:45.140
implementation by the
Johnson administration

00:50:45.140 --> 00:50:47.050
had been so desultory,

00:50:47.050 --> 00:50:50.010
but if business had gotten
behind that at the beginning

00:50:50.010 --> 00:50:52.850
we might have seen something different.

00:50:52.850 --> 00:50:55.540
Full-bore support for
the anti-tax movement

00:50:55.540 --> 00:50:58.370
by American business from the beginning

00:50:58.370 --> 00:51:00.190
even if this was gonna mean

00:51:02.377 --> 00:51:05.510
destruction of many programs that are

00:51:05.510 --> 00:51:09.370
important to the most
vulnerable populations.

00:51:09.370 --> 00:51:12.860
We saw this with Proposition
13 in California,

00:51:12.860 --> 00:51:15.093
and its effect on the
public school system,

00:51:15.970 --> 00:51:16.803
its effects

00:51:18.961 --> 00:51:21.810
on local government services and so on.

00:51:21.810 --> 00:51:23.820
A new model of the corporation

00:51:25.277 --> 00:51:26.540
became triumphant

00:51:27.513 --> 00:51:28.420
in the late 1980s

00:51:29.870 --> 00:51:32.290
where shareholder value triumphs

00:51:32.290 --> 00:51:35.200
over everything else,
trumps everything else,

00:51:35.200 --> 00:51:37.480
and the notion that business corporations

00:51:37.480 --> 00:51:39.673
should worry about anything else.

00:51:41.486 --> 00:51:42.920
If you look at the changes

00:51:42.920 --> 00:51:46.320
in business school
curriculums, for example,

00:51:46.320 --> 00:51:49.550
largely went out of the window.

00:51:49.550 --> 00:51:53.340
That all adds up to the fact
that there was a failure to see

00:51:53.340 --> 00:51:55.760
the costs of ignoring the long-term

00:51:55.760 --> 00:51:58.370
employment insecurity of labor.

00:51:58.370 --> 00:52:00.230
Andrew Wang's warning at the end

00:52:00.230 --> 00:52:01.730
of the video that I showed you

00:52:03.195 --> 00:52:05.823
that if these things are not addressed,

00:52:07.560 --> 00:52:11.020
worse than Trump is likely to come along.

00:52:11.020 --> 00:52:12.930
A final strategy

00:52:12.930 --> 00:52:14.370
I would just mention

00:52:15.512 --> 00:52:18.980
or set of a path not
taken I would mention is

00:52:18.980 --> 00:52:23.569
the strategies of left
political parties at home.

00:52:23.569 --> 00:52:25.460
- Here's the truth.

00:52:25.460 --> 00:52:27.800
No politician can reopen this factory

00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:29.780
or bring back the shipyard jobs

00:52:29.780 --> 00:52:31.490
or make your union strong again.

00:52:31.490 --> 00:52:34.300
No politician can make it
be the way it used to be

00:52:34.300 --> 00:52:36.040
because we're living in a new world now,

00:52:36.040 --> 00:52:37.940
a world without economic borders.

00:52:37.940 --> 00:52:39.490
A guy can push a button in New York

00:52:39.490 --> 00:52:41.880
and move a billion dollars
to Tokyo in a blink of an eye

00:52:41.880 --> 00:52:45.090
and in that world muscle jobs
go where muscle labor is cheap

00:52:45.090 --> 00:52:46.140
and that is not here.

00:52:47.750 --> 00:52:49.050
So if you wanna compete,

00:52:49.050 --> 00:52:51.250
you're gonna have to exercise
a different set of muscles,

00:52:51.250 --> 00:52:52.573
the one between your ears.

00:52:53.630 --> 00:52:56.960
- So that was from the
movie, "Primary Colors,"

00:52:56.960 --> 00:53:01.230
and I showed you a more
extended version of that clip,

00:53:01.230 --> 00:53:05.810
but there it is in 1992,
Bill Clinton nailing it,

00:53:05.810 --> 00:53:09.038
exactly what the problem was going to be,

00:53:09.038 --> 00:53:12.280
that the long-term employment
security that had been

00:53:13.190 --> 00:53:16.600
taken for granted by
generations of American workers

00:53:16.600 --> 00:53:20.030
had gone away and was not coming back,

00:53:20.030 --> 00:53:22.660
but what did the Clinton
administration do about that?

00:53:22.660 --> 00:53:24.300
Nothing.

00:53:24.300 --> 00:53:26.210
Instead, what did they do?

00:53:26.210 --> 00:53:28.960
They triangulated

00:53:28.960 --> 00:53:31.630
to neoliberal policies.

00:53:31.630 --> 00:53:35.610
They engaged in the expansion of NATO.

00:53:35.610 --> 00:53:38.940
They got behind things like welfare reform

00:53:38.940 --> 00:53:42.100
essentially to make it more punitive

00:53:42.100 --> 00:53:44.860
and they cozy-ed up to Wall Street

00:53:44.860 --> 00:53:46.800
by getting behind the kind

00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:51.573
of financial deregulation that
Wall Street was demanding.

00:53:52.516 --> 00:53:54.470
So the fact that even though

00:53:56.040 --> 00:53:58.933
the candidate Clinton had
identified the problem,

00:54:00.530 --> 00:54:01.830
he didn't

00:54:01.830 --> 00:54:05.610
really take seriously the
effort to do anything about it.

00:54:05.610 --> 00:54:09.280
Indeed in the class on the
subprime mortgage crisis

00:54:09.280 --> 00:54:13.650
he became one of the
champions of getting mortgages

00:54:13.650 --> 00:54:16.560
to people who are gonna
be unlikely to be able

00:54:16.560 --> 00:54:19.633
to service them as soon
as the recession came.

00:54:20.880 --> 00:54:22.190
So very much

00:54:22.190 --> 00:54:26.980
he identified the problem
and the different do anything

00:54:26.980 --> 00:54:29.100
of a serious time to address it

00:54:29.100 --> 00:54:33.110
and he squandered whatever
political capital he had

00:54:33.110 --> 00:54:35.820
in the first years of his administration

00:54:35.820 --> 00:54:38.803
when he controlled all
the houses and so on.

00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:42.630
And by the way, it wasn't just here.

00:54:42.630 --> 00:54:45.360
We saw Tony Blair's government in the UK

00:54:45.360 --> 00:54:48.100
did many comparable things.

00:54:48.100 --> 00:54:50.220
Even in Germany,

00:54:50.220 --> 00:54:52.050
I believe I mentioned to you,

00:54:52.050 --> 00:54:53.660
if you look at the Hartz reforms

00:54:53.660 --> 00:54:55.740
which were neoliberal reforms,

00:54:55.740 --> 00:54:59.160
not that different than those pursued

00:55:00.860 --> 00:55:04.410
by the Blair government, or
by the Clinton administration,

00:55:04.410 --> 00:55:06.450
or indeed in countries even like France

00:55:06.450 --> 00:55:09.040
where Mitterrand did an about turn,

00:55:09.040 --> 00:55:10.830
who were the Hartz reforms implemented

00:55:10.830 --> 00:55:12.950
by in the early years of this century?

00:55:12.950 --> 00:55:17.240
It was a coalition of the
Social Democrats and the Greens.

00:55:17.240 --> 00:55:18.911
It was not

00:55:18.911 --> 00:55:20.933
a right-wing imposition.

00:55:22.843 --> 00:55:24.560
So all of these parties were

00:55:24.560 --> 00:55:28.720
essentially engaging in triangulation

00:55:28.720 --> 00:55:32.740
instead of addressing the
long-term employment insecurity

00:55:32.740 --> 00:55:35.510
that Bill Clinton did indeed identify

00:55:36.877 --> 00:55:39.733
in the 1992 New Hampshire primary.

00:55:41.020 --> 00:55:43.780
The difficulty with
triangulation as I've said

00:55:43.780 --> 00:55:46.610
is that it's good
tactics, but bad strategy.

00:55:46.610 --> 00:55:47.750
It's good tactics

00:55:50.348 --> 00:55:52.380
because if you just think about it

00:55:52.380 --> 00:55:55.500
as a one-shot game as game theorists say,

00:55:55.500 --> 00:55:57.110
you can move to the middle,

00:55:57.110 --> 00:56:00.770
peel off some support from your opponent

00:56:02.144 --> 00:56:06.150
and the people on your
flank have no place to go.

00:56:06.150 --> 00:56:09.970
But if you think about it
as a dynamic game over time,

00:56:09.970 --> 00:56:11.930
once the other side figures out

00:56:11.930 --> 00:56:13.810
that that's what you're doing,

00:56:13.810 --> 00:56:16.670
their incentive is to just
keep moving the goal post

00:56:16.670 --> 00:56:19.770
and dragging you along as they go.

00:56:19.770 --> 00:56:22.050
This was the story of
the anti-tax movement

00:56:22.050 --> 00:56:26.070
that culminated in the
2001 bill that I described

00:56:26.070 --> 00:56:30.113
at some length in our
class about the estate tax.

00:56:31.048 --> 00:56:33.400
Indeed the sort of tragic denouement

00:56:33.400 --> 00:56:36.610
of that story was when in 2012

00:56:36.610 --> 00:56:39.440
the Obama administration
made virtually all

00:56:40.681 --> 00:56:42.050
of the 2001 tax cuts,

00:56:42.050 --> 00:56:44.460
biggest regressive change

00:56:44.460 --> 00:56:48.400
in the tax system in
American history permanent.

00:56:48.400 --> 00:56:49.233
So this was

00:56:51.160 --> 00:56:51.993
I think

00:56:53.219 --> 00:56:54.660
a big missed opportunity

00:56:56.060 --> 00:57:00.397
reinforced by this sort of
"living right and thinking left,"

00:57:01.893 --> 00:57:03.480
to quote

00:57:03.480 --> 00:57:04.710
the phrase

00:57:06.314 --> 00:57:08.340
from the book that I mentioned to you

00:57:11.440 --> 00:57:13.790
when I was giving that lecture

00:57:13.790 --> 00:57:16.060
on things like affirmative action

00:57:17.439 --> 00:57:19.950
and managing the financial crisis.

00:57:19.950 --> 00:57:22.590
Affirmative action is about promotions

00:57:22.590 --> 00:57:24.740
in the police department
and the fire department.

00:57:24.740 --> 00:57:27.190
That's where the rubber meets the road.

00:57:27.190 --> 00:57:30.760
Doesn't really affect
people living in Scarsdale.

00:57:30.760 --> 00:57:32.763
In the financial crisis,

00:57:34.090 --> 00:57:38.680
unlike what FDR had done
often the depression,

00:57:38.680 --> 00:57:41.400
I showed you how the Obama administration

00:57:41.400 --> 00:57:43.640
essentially got on board

00:57:43.640 --> 00:57:47.540
with the Bush administration's
policies and allowed

00:57:47.540 --> 00:57:51.030
the financial sector to
write the vast majority

00:57:51.955 --> 00:57:54.810
of the bill and not to pay any cost

00:57:54.810 --> 00:57:57.010
for the crisis that they had created

00:57:58.088 --> 00:58:02.180
thereby fueling what would
eventually erupt as the kind

00:58:03.548 --> 00:58:06.850
of enraged politics of anti-elitism

00:58:06.850 --> 00:58:08.163
in 2016.

00:58:09.850 --> 00:58:14.490
Given that they were converging

00:58:14.490 --> 00:58:16.990
on questions of economic management,

00:58:16.990 --> 00:58:19.880
instead what left-wing
parties tended to do

00:58:19.880 --> 00:58:22.850
or left-of-center parties
tended to do was to begin

00:58:22.850 --> 00:58:26.360
investing in culture and
identity issues as ways

00:58:26.360 --> 00:58:29.630
of differentiating themselves
from the Republicans.

00:58:29.630 --> 00:58:33.880
This goes back to the
McGovern-Fraser reforms which start

00:58:34.912 --> 00:58:38.830
to emphasize the importance
of descriptive representation

00:58:39.700 --> 00:58:44.510
in politics which I'll
have more to say shortly.

00:58:44.510 --> 00:58:45.963
So what is to be done?

00:58:47.590 --> 00:58:49.720
So the bottom line is,

00:58:49.720 --> 00:58:52.720
and this is picking up on
the lecture about parties,

00:58:52.720 --> 00:58:56.010
that the most important
thing that needs to happen

00:58:56.010 --> 00:58:58.200
is to strengthen political parties

00:58:58.200 --> 00:59:03.090
so that they can operate
more like teams and thereby

00:59:03.090 --> 00:59:06.840
get themselves behind
the sorts of policies

00:59:06.840 --> 00:59:10.690
that are gonna lead
large numbers of insecure

00:59:10.690 --> 00:59:14.160
former or post industrial workers

00:59:14.160 --> 00:59:16.913
and middle-class people to support them.

00:59:19.270 --> 00:59:21.510
In all systems, all political systems,

00:59:21.510 --> 00:59:23.420
that basically means a number of things.

00:59:23.420 --> 00:59:27.880
One is disempower party
members and outside groups

00:59:27.880 --> 00:59:31.370
in the selection of candidates,
leaders, and platform.

00:59:31.370 --> 00:59:34.760
Members sound like
shareholders, but as we saw,

00:59:34.760 --> 00:59:39.430
they tend to be unrepresentative
of the voters for a party,

00:59:39.430 --> 00:59:41.230
particularly when you have a large party,

00:59:41.230 --> 00:59:45.023
never mind the voters in the electorate.

00:59:45.930 --> 00:59:49.430
Get away from referendums and
other forms of unbundling.

00:59:49.430 --> 00:59:51.133
Parties are there to bundle.

00:59:52.040 --> 00:59:54.150
We had a long lecture on bundling,

00:59:54.150 --> 00:59:55.810
why bundling is important,

00:59:55.810 --> 00:59:58.610
because it forces

00:59:58.610 --> 01:00:02.440
us to discount what we want by
everything else that we want

01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:05.340
and come up with policies that can appeal

01:00:05.340 --> 01:00:07.940
to a broad swath of voters.

01:00:07.940 --> 01:00:11.480
Empower backbenchers to pick frontbenchers

01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:15.330
so the parties can operate
as teams in the parliament

01:00:15.330 --> 01:00:17.380
and empower frontbenchers to pick

01:00:17.380 --> 01:00:19.860
backbenchers for the same reason

01:00:19.860 --> 01:00:23.920
so that the people who get
picked can both win electorally,

01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:27.250
but will also support the program

01:00:27.250 --> 01:00:29.566
that the leadership desires.

01:00:29.566 --> 01:00:33.210
So you give a lot of
delegation to the leadership,

01:00:33.210 --> 01:00:36.180
but they also have enough
rope to hang themselves.

01:00:36.180 --> 01:00:39.220
If they can't deliver successes,

01:00:39.220 --> 01:00:42.030
they won't be there for long.

01:00:42.030 --> 01:00:43.690
In multiparty systems,

01:00:43.690 --> 01:00:45.810
this means increased thresholds

01:00:45.810 --> 01:00:48.690
to try and get parties to combine

01:00:48.690 --> 01:00:52.830
so you combat the fragmentation
of parties that creates

01:00:53.810 --> 01:00:56.350
huge opportunities for rent extraction

01:00:56.350 --> 01:01:00.190
when people are needed to join coalitions.

01:01:00.190 --> 01:01:02.930
Push for reelection coalitions so at least

01:01:03.890 --> 01:01:06.690
voters have a better
idea of what governments

01:01:06.690 --> 01:01:09.963
are likely to form after the election.

01:01:11.100 --> 01:01:15.150
Prefer closed PR to open
list PR because open list PR

01:01:15.150 --> 01:01:17.880
encourages celebrities to run.

01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:19.253
It encourages people,

01:01:20.170 --> 01:01:25.040
intraparty competition
to make private promises,

01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:28.240
and that's exactly inimical to the idea

01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:31.036
of parties operating as teams.

01:01:31.036 --> 01:01:34.223
Turning to two-party systems, in Britain,

01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:37.670
change the leadership selection rules back

01:01:37.670 --> 01:01:40.410
to something more like they used to have

01:01:40.410 --> 01:01:43.370
when the backbenchers
picked the frontbenchers

01:01:43.370 --> 01:01:44.710
and got rid of them

01:01:45.858 --> 01:01:48.553
if the frontbenchers were not delivering.

01:01:49.810 --> 01:01:51.880
Get rid of the fixed parliaments act,

01:01:51.880 --> 01:01:54.260
which again is a way of disempowering

01:01:54.260 --> 01:01:56.333
the authority of leaders.

01:01:57.260 --> 01:01:58.530
Bigger constituencies.

01:01:58.530 --> 01:02:01.120
They a couple years ago had a commission

01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:03.040
recommending that they reduce

01:02:04.431 --> 01:02:07.860
the House of Commons from 650 to 600,

01:02:07.860 --> 01:02:09.330
a very modest reduction.

01:02:09.330 --> 01:02:12.180
They've even rejected that,

01:02:12.180 --> 01:02:14.900
but one of the problems in Britain is

01:02:16.489 --> 01:02:18.060
that all the wealth is in London

01:02:18.060 --> 01:02:21.030
and many parts of the north of England

01:02:21.030 --> 01:02:24.435
have per capita income below Mississippi.

01:02:24.435 --> 01:02:26.480
You really want a sliver of London

01:02:26.480 --> 01:02:28.850
in every constituency in Britain

01:02:28.850 --> 01:02:31.180
if you want a healthier system

01:02:31.180 --> 01:02:33.700
and certainly the constituencies

01:02:33.700 --> 01:02:36.120
which are a tenth of the size of ours

01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:39.923
and a third of the size
of Germany are too small.

01:02:40.950 --> 01:02:42.893
Stop having referendums.

01:02:45.270 --> 01:02:46.773
In the United States,

01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:50.610
first of all don't think abolishing

01:02:50.610 --> 01:02:53.830
the electoral college is
a solution to anything.

01:02:53.830 --> 01:02:55.347
Everybody says, "It's so unfair.

01:02:55.347 --> 01:02:58.067
"Hillary won three million more votes."

01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:00.810
Abolishing the electoral college,

01:03:01.890 --> 01:03:05.400
it will increase the independent
authority of the president.

01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:08.950
It will make us function more
like a Latin American country.

01:03:08.950 --> 01:03:10.700
That's exactly what we shouldn't be doing.

01:03:10.700 --> 01:03:14.290
We should strengthening
the power of the parties

01:03:14.290 --> 01:03:17.540
in Congress at the
expense of the presidency,

01:03:17.540 --> 01:03:21.130
going back to something more like

01:03:21.130 --> 01:03:26.110
what prevailed until 1824
when the congressional parties

01:03:26.110 --> 01:03:30.280
pick the presidential candidates
and made the system operate

01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:33.690
more like a parliamentary system.

01:03:33.690 --> 01:03:36.160
Deemphasize the importance of primaries,

01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:39.450
both Congressional and Presidential.

01:03:39.450 --> 01:03:41.980
Presidential primaries

01:03:41.980 --> 01:03:43.430
have really only been important

01:03:43.430 --> 01:03:47.890
since the McGovern-Fraser
reforms of the 1971.

01:03:47.890 --> 01:03:50.080
What people don't know about primaries

01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:51.773
is the very low turnout.

01:03:52.610 --> 01:03:54.900
So Donald Trump, for example,

01:03:54.900 --> 01:03:57.600
was selected as the Republican candidate

01:03:57.600 --> 01:04:00.720
by less than 5% of the
American electorate,

01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:02.303
but then he's the candidate.

01:04:03.510 --> 01:04:06.040
If there's a weak candidate
on the other side,

01:04:06.040 --> 01:04:09.150
he might end up, as he
did, being the president.

01:04:09.150 --> 01:04:11.050
So one proposal would be,

01:04:11.050 --> 01:04:14.550
since most American voters don't realize

01:04:14.550 --> 01:04:17.050
that primaries are so unrepresentative

01:04:18.816 --> 01:04:22.180
and would be a proposal
whereby if the turnout

01:04:22.180 --> 01:04:24.730
in a primary falls below some threshold,

01:04:24.730 --> 01:04:26.943
such as 75% of the general election

01:04:26.943 --> 01:04:29.223
turnout in the previous election,

01:04:30.492 --> 01:04:33.890
then you discount the
primary and let the party

01:04:35.260 --> 01:04:37.043
choose the candidate.

01:04:38.330 --> 01:04:41.450
Similarly, if you think
about legislative elections,

01:04:41.450 --> 01:04:43.940
primaries have been
around since progressives.

01:04:43.940 --> 01:04:46.320
This is an example of a reform

01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:48.380
dreamed up on a starry-eyed left

01:04:48.380 --> 01:04:53.290
that has since been
hijacked by the steely-eyed

01:04:53.290 --> 01:04:55.400
well-endowed forces

01:04:57.820 --> 01:05:00.900
in other parts of the electorate as well.

01:05:00.900 --> 01:05:03.293
You could have a similar kind of rule.

01:05:04.734 --> 01:05:06.780
What we have is a world in which,

01:05:06.780 --> 01:05:10.910
I should say the primaries
have been around for 120 years,

01:05:10.910 --> 01:05:13.340
but what's changed is
the number of safe seats.

01:05:13.340 --> 01:05:15.940
We have many more safe
seats than we used to have

01:05:15.940 --> 01:05:18.650
which in unsafe seats the only election

01:05:18.650 --> 01:05:20.923
that matters is the primary election.

01:05:22.027 --> 01:05:24.040
Again so you can have

01:05:24.040 --> 01:05:27.060
AOC elected in the 14th
district in New York

01:05:27.060 --> 01:05:29.870
on a 11% turnout in a primary

01:05:29.870 --> 01:05:33.433
or Jim Jordan elected
in Ohio's 4th district

01:05:33.433 --> 01:05:36.963
on a 15% turnout in the primary.

01:05:38.934 --> 01:05:41.758
Again you could have a rule

01:05:41.758 --> 01:05:45.400
whereby if the turnout
in the primary fell below

01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:47.890
some number or some threshold

01:05:47.890 --> 01:05:51.370
that the party leadership
would have a say.

01:05:51.370 --> 01:05:52.750
No jungle primaries.

01:05:52.750 --> 01:05:56.950
This is a new flavor du
jour they put in California

01:05:56.950 --> 01:06:00.200
where everybody runs in the primary.

01:06:00.200 --> 01:06:03.810
The thought was it would produce
more moderate candidates.

01:06:03.810 --> 01:06:06.370
In fact it doesn't because the,

01:06:06.370 --> 01:06:07.900
even in jungle primaries,

01:06:07.900 --> 01:06:12.803
it tends to be the activists
who turn out in the primaries.

01:06:13.770 --> 01:06:14.743
For the Senate,

01:06:15.770 --> 01:06:19.070
get behind plans to
admit DC and Puerto Rico

01:06:19.070 --> 01:06:23.250
and proposals to split up
states like California and Texas

01:06:23.250 --> 01:06:26.520
so that the massive
malapportionment in the center

01:06:28.816 --> 01:06:31.730
could be redressed somewhat at the margin.

01:06:31.730 --> 01:06:33.830
I'm talking here about things that could

01:06:33.830 --> 01:06:37.380
be done without constitutional amendments

01:06:37.380 --> 01:06:42.160
or without a new
constitutional convention.

01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:43.840
House, in the House,

01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:48.400
we should be redistricting
for interparty competitiveness

01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:51.350
by reducing the number of safe seats

01:06:51.350 --> 01:06:55.490
and the way to do this is
to change the redistricting.

01:06:55.490 --> 01:06:58.520
The redistricting
historically has been done

01:07:00.371 --> 01:07:02.313
by state legislatures,

01:07:03.580 --> 01:07:07.850
and of course whoever controls
the state legislature does it

01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:12.430
to maximize the benefit for their party.

01:07:12.430 --> 01:07:13.263
Earlier this year,

01:07:13.263 --> 01:07:16.620
the Supreme Court has decided
it will never get involved

01:07:16.620 --> 01:07:18.530
in partisan gerrymandering.

01:07:18.530 --> 01:07:20.030
It's too much of a political issue

01:07:20.030 --> 01:07:22.473
and they don't know what to do about it.

01:07:24.880 --> 01:07:26.700
So what happens is

01:07:26.700 --> 01:07:31.093
the parties draw the districts
to benefit themselves.

01:07:33.520 --> 01:07:36.660
So I think there now 21 states have gone

01:07:36.660 --> 01:07:40.240
to so-called independent commissions.

01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:41.700
This could be a good idea.

01:07:41.700 --> 01:07:42.960
In Britain, for example,

01:07:42.960 --> 01:07:45.650
they have an independent
commission after the

01:07:46.700 --> 01:07:50.100
census that draws up boundaries,

01:07:50.100 --> 01:07:51.760
boundary commission they call it,

01:07:51.760 --> 01:07:53.760
and then parliament
can vote it up or down,

01:07:53.760 --> 01:07:55.610
but they can't change it.

01:07:55.610 --> 01:07:57.650
So that's one way of doing it.

01:07:57.650 --> 01:07:59.963
The problem is, so we have now,

01:08:01.396 --> 01:08:05.920
I think we have 14 in
operation since the 2010 census

01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:07.520
and another seven which will be

01:08:07.520 --> 01:08:10.900
operating after the 2020 census,

01:08:10.900 --> 01:08:12.350
but if you look at them,

01:08:12.350 --> 01:08:17.060
they're either so-called
bipartisan or nonpartisan.

01:08:17.060 --> 01:08:18.890
The bipartisan ones are hopeless

01:08:18.890 --> 01:08:22.330
in that the parties carve out the states.

01:08:22.330 --> 01:08:24.640
They essentially make deals.

01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:26.010
The nonpartisan ones,

01:08:26.010 --> 01:08:29.030
the difficulty with them is that they're

01:08:29.030 --> 01:08:31.160
not given the mandate to make districts

01:08:31.160 --> 01:08:34.080
competitive across the parties.

01:08:34.080 --> 01:08:39.080
Indeed they are told to do
things like not split up cities,

01:08:39.128 --> 01:08:42.820
keep neighborhoods together and so on.

01:08:42.820 --> 01:08:46.440
Really what you need and what would make

01:08:47.310 --> 01:08:51.000
for the healthiest interparty competition

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:56.000
would be every district in
America having some urban voters,

01:08:56.080 --> 01:08:59.580
some suburban voters and some rural voters

01:08:59.580 --> 01:09:02.020
so that the politician who is running

01:09:02.020 --> 01:09:05.400
for office in those districts would

01:09:05.400 --> 01:09:08.130
discount the preferences
of all three groups

01:09:08.130 --> 01:09:12.450
against one another in coming
up with their platform.

01:09:12.450 --> 01:09:14.220
So for flower-petal districts,

01:09:14.220 --> 01:09:18.000
you might think to achieve that goal,

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.420
and then we should think
about better approaches

01:09:21.545 --> 01:09:24.220
to descriptive representation
because the trouble

01:09:24.220 --> 01:09:27.700
with majority-minority districts is

01:09:27.700 --> 01:09:28.610
you achieve,

01:09:28.610 --> 01:09:30.630
they did indeed increase

01:09:32.475 --> 01:09:35.680
the number of African-Americans
sent to Congress,

01:09:35.680 --> 01:09:38.500
particularly from the South
where none had been sent

01:09:40.316 --> 01:09:42.433
since Jim Crow in many cases,

01:09:43.300 --> 01:09:46.840
but it comes at the price of
exactly what we don't want.

01:09:46.840 --> 01:09:49.990
We do not want blue cities in red states.

01:09:49.990 --> 01:09:51.310
We do not want

01:09:52.410 --> 01:09:54.650
all the Democrats, African-Americans,

01:09:54.650 --> 01:09:56.750
to be herded into one district,

01:09:56.750 --> 01:09:58.730
and then have Republican

01:10:00.410 --> 01:10:03.970
nonminority districts electing
separate representatives.

01:10:03.970 --> 01:10:06.280
That is exactly what we don't want.

01:10:06.280 --> 01:10:10.670
There are better ways to get
descriptive representation.

01:10:10.670 --> 01:10:12.980
In some Nordic countries, for example,

01:10:12.980 --> 01:10:15.893
with a PR system they just say, well,

01:10:16.780 --> 01:10:19.720
every third person on
the list must be a woman,

01:10:19.720 --> 01:10:23.520
or in India in 1932
there was the Poona Pact

01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:27.380
which essentially it said in
a number of constituencies,

01:10:27.380 --> 01:10:30.703
believe it was 143 constituencies,

01:10:31.670 --> 01:10:33.660
the only person who could run

01:10:35.850 --> 01:10:37.960
what was in those days
called an untouchable,

01:10:37.960 --> 01:10:41.620
now is referred to as a member
of an unscheduled caste.

01:10:41.620 --> 01:10:43.960
So you can get descriptive representation

01:10:43.960 --> 01:10:48.000
without screwing up the
boundaries of the constituencies.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.150
So these would be better ways

01:10:50.150 --> 01:10:52.940
to get descriptive representation.

01:10:52.940 --> 01:10:55.230
Majority-minority districts,

01:10:55.230 --> 01:10:57.130
which now account for a fifth

01:10:59.063 --> 01:11:01.470
of Congress' districts, are not.

01:11:01.470 --> 01:11:05.920
So the upshot is that stronger
and more disciplined parties

01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:08.610
will have better incentives
and will be better able

01:11:08.610 --> 01:11:12.040
to address the long term
employment insecurity

01:11:12.040 --> 01:11:13.840
that we've been talking about

01:11:13.840 --> 01:11:17.150
and head off the dangerously
destructive politics

01:11:17.150 --> 01:11:21.960
that we've seen since 2016,
or to put it differently,

01:11:21.960 --> 01:11:24.080
what we should be trying to do is to marry

01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:26.880
the arguments of these two books.

01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:29.130
So I thank you for indulging me

01:11:29.130 --> 01:11:31.400
over these previous 26 lectures

01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:33.485
and I hope I'll see some
of you in the future.

01:11:33.485 --> 01:11:36.485
(students clapping)

01:11:51.674 --> 01:11:54.841

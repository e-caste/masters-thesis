00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:06.640
Prof: Welcome Orgo
survivors, and others.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:10.415
I stuck this slide up,
sort of outside the framework

00:00:10.415 --> 00:00:13.757
of the regular lecture,
and I did so just to indicate

00:00:13.757 --> 00:00:16.250
that if you go through the
scientific literature,

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.300
you can probably find a neat
case of coevolution,

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.610
with some kind of beautiful
biology in it,

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:23.670
coming out every week.
 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.180
This one came out last week.
 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.410
This is a Proboscis fly that
lives in South Africa,

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.780
and it pollinates flowers.
 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.150
And you can see that it has
evolved a very long proboscis,

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.910
and the flower has evolved a
very long nectary,

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.011
and it looks,
in fact, very much like

00:00:41.011 --> 00:00:44.528
Darwin's orchid,
and that moth called Praedicta,

00:00:44.528 --> 00:00:48.490
that Darwin predicted would
have a long proboscis.

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:49.630
But this is a fly.
 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:52.214
This is not at all closely
related to moths,

00:00:52.214 --> 00:00:55.760
and that flower is not at all
closely related to orchids.

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.600
So this is convergent evolution.
 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.158
And I think you'll remember,
in reading the book,

00:01:00.158 --> 00:01:02.912
that there was a neat
alternative hypothesis posed in

00:01:02.912 --> 00:01:07.471
the book saying,
"Hey, it wasn't about the

00:01:07.471 --> 00:01:12.209
coevolution of the flower and
the moth.

00:01:12.209 --> 00:01:16.843
There's a spider that sits on
the orchid, and when the moth

00:01:16.843 --> 00:01:20.438
flies in, the spider tries to
eat the moth;

00:01:20.438 --> 00:01:23.546
and so the moth kind of evolved
a long proboscis so that it

00:01:23.546 --> 00:01:26.920
wouldn't touch that flower with
anything but a ten-foot pole.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.129
Okay?
 

00:01:28.129 --> 00:01:30.492
So that was an alternative
hypothesis, and there's actually

00:01:30.492 --> 00:01:32.528
some evidence for that in the
case of the orchid on

00:01:32.528 --> 00:01:33.140
Madagascar.
 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.660
But in the case of this
interaction,

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:40.120
which is in Cape Province in
South Africa,

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:44.819
with a fly and something that
is not at all an orchid,

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:47.977
the data indicate that,
in fact, a coevolutionary story

00:01:47.977 --> 00:01:50.307
works just fine;
and that looks to be what's

00:01:50.307 --> 00:01:50.780
going on.
 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.182
The longer the nectary,
the more likely the

00:01:55.182 --> 00:01:58.364
pollination;
the longer the proboscis,

00:01:58.364 --> 00:02:02.204
the greater the energetic
reward--and the two things feed

00:02:02.204 --> 00:02:04.400
back and forth to each other.
 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.378
So this indicates actually that
Darwin's original idea was

00:02:09.378 --> 00:02:11.038
probably correct.
 

00:02:11.038 --> 00:02:13.247
And I would note that in the
case of the orchid on

00:02:13.247 --> 00:02:15.637
Madagascar,
the fact that there's a spider

00:02:15.637 --> 00:02:19.033
doesn't really mean that Darwin
was wrong in generating his

00:02:19.033 --> 00:02:21.026
story,
it just means that there is

00:02:21.026 --> 00:02:22.590
also something else going on.
 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.129
Okay, so.
 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.988
We spent the first part of the
course talking about

00:02:44.988 --> 00:02:45.919
microevolution.
 

00:02:45.919 --> 00:02:48.657
We spent the second part of the
course talking about

00:02:48.657 --> 00:02:49.568
macroevolution.
 

00:02:49.568 --> 00:02:52.797
And today and Monday,
we're going to talk about

00:02:52.797 --> 00:02:56.866
coevolution and evolutionary
medicine as two areas in which

00:02:56.866 --> 00:03:00.094
micro and macroevolution
interact in generating

00:03:00.094 --> 00:03:02.128
explanations of things.
 

00:03:02.128 --> 00:03:06.280
And I think that you'll
probably see,

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.002
if you think about it,
that in almost any reasonably

00:03:09.002 --> 00:03:11.620
complicated or large-scale
biological pattern,

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.560
both things have been involved;
both micro and macroevolution.

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.503
There's been some things that
have been changing slowly and

00:03:18.503 --> 00:03:20.840
some things that have been
changing quickly.

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:28.574
Now the tight genetic
definition of coevolution is

00:03:28.574 --> 00:03:29.680
this.
 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.055
In one species you have a
change in a gene,

00:03:33.055 --> 00:03:36.190
and that--excuse me for missing
this;

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:37.900
I was doing proofreading this
morning;

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.303
there should be 't' there--it
stimulates an evolutionary

00:03:41.303 --> 00:03:43.840
change in a gene in the other
species,

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.340
and that change in the other
species stimulates another

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.595
change in the first species;
so that you have kind of a gene

00:03:49.595 --> 00:03:51.340
for gene succession in time.
 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.460
One thing happens here;
that stimulates something here;

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:55.460
that stimulates something here.
 

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:59.449
That is the tight genetic
definition of coevolution.

00:03:59.449 --> 00:04:02.774
If you could demonstrate that,
I think everybody would agree,

00:04:02.774 --> 00:04:04.990
hey, you nailed it,
it's really there.

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:07.688
It's hard to do.
 

00:04:07.688 --> 00:04:10.879
The reason it's hard to do is
that we don't normally know what

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:12.449
the genes are that involved.
 

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:15.031
We can see the phenotype,
but we have difficulty

00:04:15.031 --> 00:04:16.240
inferring the genes.
 

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:20.370
There are some cases of this
that are well documented in

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:23.149
rusts, rust fungi inhabiting
wheat;

00:04:23.149 --> 00:04:25.699
Ustilago hordii is one of them.
 

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:29.581
So, you know,
pathogens of crop plants are

00:04:29.581 --> 00:04:35.170
things where this kind of
coevolution is well documented.

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:37.940
Another kind of coevolution is
phylogenetic.

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:41.949
So you use tree thinking to try
to infer what's been going on.

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:43.879
And you look at closely
interacting organisms--

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:45.603
pathogens, parasites,
pollinators,

00:04:45.603 --> 00:04:48.815
things like that--
and you see if the trees can be

00:04:48.815 --> 00:04:51.120
laid right on top of each other.
 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:55.399
Or, if you have one group over
here--

00:04:55.399 --> 00:04:57.057
so you have,
say, the pathogens over here

00:04:57.057 --> 00:04:58.550
and you have the hosts over
here--

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.053
you see if the trees line up
and touch each other at the

00:05:02.053 --> 00:05:02.500
tips.
 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.819
That would indicate--without
any crosses,

00:05:04.819 --> 00:05:08.394
so you don't see any lines kind
of crossing over when you line

00:05:08.394 --> 00:05:11.019
them up--
that would mean that the trees

00:05:11.019 --> 00:05:14.894
have exactly the same topology,
and that every time the host

00:05:14.894 --> 00:05:18.560
speciated,
the pathogen speciated.

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:21.857
And if you see crossing lines,
it means that a pathogen has

00:05:21.857 --> 00:05:23.790
jumped from one host to another.
 

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:27.245
So that kind of approach gives
you another definition of

00:05:27.245 --> 00:05:30.699
coevolution, and another tool
for trying to infer it.

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:36.259
Now before I get into
coevolution proper,

00:05:36.259 --> 00:05:38.389
I want to talk a little bit
about co-adaptation,

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:42.406
because co-adaptation actually
contains within it a message

00:05:42.406 --> 00:05:45.800
that's of general significance
for coevolution.

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:49.632
Right at the beginning of life,
the first replicators had to

00:05:49.632 --> 00:05:52.944
co-adapt in order to generate
say a well-functioning

00:05:52.944 --> 00:05:56.680
hypercycle;
they had to co-adapt to each

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:57.370
other.
 

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:01.071
And at the level of the cell,
when you're looking at key

00:06:01.071 --> 00:06:04.367
molecules in the cell,
all these interactions have

00:06:04.367 --> 00:06:06.319
co-adapted to each other.
 

00:06:06.319 --> 00:06:11.269
So, for example,
the ribosome here is in green,

00:06:11.269 --> 00:06:14.439
and you've got the mRNA coming
into it like a ribbon,

00:06:14.439 --> 00:06:17.490
and you've got--the transfer
RNA is pulling in the amino

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:21.060
acids out at their tips,
into the reaction center of the

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:21.730
ribosome.
 

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:25.213
And that brings the amino acids
into close juxtaposition where

00:06:25.213 --> 00:06:27.839
an enzyme can operate on them to
join them,

00:06:27.839 --> 00:06:31.269
and then clip them off of the
incoming tRNAs,

00:06:31.269 --> 00:06:33.906
which then go on out,
back into the cell to do their

00:06:33.906 --> 00:06:36.920
job again,
and the protein grows out here.

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:40.240
Well, this is a rough sketch of
the structure of the ribosome.

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:43.637
It's actually more complicated
than that, and it has really a

00:06:43.637 --> 00:06:46.980
beautifully sculpted reaction
center in the middle of it.

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:52.023
And the message from this is
that every single important

00:06:52.023 --> 00:06:56.608
biochemical step and
morphological structure inside

00:06:56.608 --> 00:07:02.451
the cell is tightly co-adapted,
so that form matches function,

00:07:02.451 --> 00:07:04.230
throughout the cell.
 

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:08.951
And the reason that's the case
is that these things are

00:07:08.951 --> 00:07:14.550
processing reactions that happen
thousands of times a second,

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:18.355
and that therefore accumulate
to have big effects over the

00:07:18.355 --> 00:07:20.160
lifetime of the organism.
 

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:24.774
If you've got something in you
that is going to happen say 50

00:07:24.774 --> 00:07:29.014
billion times in your lifetime,
and you get a very,

00:07:29.014 --> 00:07:32.779
very tiny, 1/1000^(th) of 1%
change in it,

00:07:32.779 --> 00:07:34.980
that then accumulates 50
billion times,

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:38.329
you have a massive result at
the end of your life.

00:07:38.329 --> 00:07:42.220
So that things that are
happening down at that level are

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:45.050
driven by high frequency
interactions.

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:48.279
And the frequency with which
things interact is one of the

00:07:48.279 --> 00:07:50.660
key elements of coevolution,
in general.

00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:57.680
If you look at a slightly
higher level in the cell,

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:00.769
you can find co-adaptation
going on again.

00:08:00.769 --> 00:08:05.240
The axons that run into nerve
fibers have different lengths,

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:09.470
so that the signal coming from
the brain will arrive at things

00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:12.730
that need to be coordinated at
the same time.

00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:17.598
The muscles in electric eels
have been turned into storage

00:08:17.598 --> 00:08:20.389
batteries,
and the axons that run from the

00:08:20.389 --> 00:08:22.560
brain have had their lengths
modified,

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:25.351
so that they hit the different
cells in the storage battery at

00:08:25.351 --> 00:08:28.369
exactly the same instance,
so that the electrical charge

00:08:28.369 --> 00:08:30.959
goes out,
all at the same time.

00:08:30.959 --> 00:08:34.830
A four- or five-foot electric
eel can kill a horse;

00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:36.558
that's how much electricity
they can store up.

00:08:36.558 --> 00:08:39.859
But they can only do it because
it's released exactly at the

00:08:39.859 --> 00:08:40.529
same time.
 

00:08:40.529 --> 00:08:42.856
If it dribbled out,
it wouldn't take the horse

00:08:42.856 --> 00:08:45.413
down;
or the naturalist exploring the

00:08:45.413 --> 00:08:47.679
shallow river in South America.
 

00:08:47.679 --> 00:08:50.240
Right?
 

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:52.009
Same kind of thing in your
brain.

00:08:52.009 --> 00:08:55.644
There's very tight
co-adaptation between your

00:08:55.644 --> 00:09:00.850
retina and its projections into
the visual cortex at the back of

00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:02.090
your brain.
 

00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:08.111
So these connections have been
sculpted by evolution so that

00:09:08.111 --> 00:09:13.317
the re-creation of the external
world, in your head,

00:09:13.317 --> 00:09:14.850
is precise.
 

00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:18.827
And this has gone on in every
organ of your body in one way or

00:09:18.827 --> 00:09:19.480
another.
 

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:22.995
So the integration of the
organism is achieved by

00:09:22.995 --> 00:09:25.120
co-adaptation of its parts.
 

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:28.825
That's not precisely the gene
for gene kind of interaction

00:09:28.825 --> 00:09:31.379
between species,
that people think about in

00:09:31.379 --> 00:09:33.782
coevolution,
but it is a gene for gene

00:09:33.782 --> 00:09:37.639
interaction in the determination
of those organ systems.

00:09:37.639 --> 00:09:40.624
A gene changes over here,
and another gene has to change

00:09:40.624 --> 00:09:41.330
over there.
 

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:45.275
It's just that the process is
going on inside a single genome,

00:09:45.275 --> 00:09:47.798
rather than in two different
genomes.

00:09:47.798 --> 00:09:52.048
So that's not normally what
biologists mean by coevolution.

00:09:52.048 --> 00:09:57.488
It usually refers to the mutual
adjustment of the genomes of

00:09:57.488 --> 00:09:59.240
separate species.
 

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:00.798
And that's kind of arbitrary I
think,

00:10:00.798 --> 00:10:04.879
and the reason I think it's
arbitrary is that we now

00:10:04.879 --> 00:10:09.678
conceive of the organism as kind
of a babushka doll of nested

00:10:09.678 --> 00:10:14.558
levels of hierarchies that have
been assembled over the course

00:10:14.558 --> 00:10:19.437
of the evolution of life,
and that things that we now see

00:10:19.437 --> 00:10:24.283
as being integrated organisms,
earlier, were independently

00:10:24.283 --> 00:10:27.763
evolving systems,
and at that point the

00:10:27.763 --> 00:10:31.769
coevolution, that we now see as
co-adaptation,

00:10:31.769 --> 00:10:37.629
was actually coevolution sensu
strictu.

00:10:37.629 --> 00:10:43.048
So I'm now going to talk about
some intercellular symbioses.

00:10:43.048 --> 00:10:46.837
And the reason I picked
intercellular symbioses as the

00:10:46.837 --> 00:10:50.625
first example of real
coevolution is that these things

00:10:50.625 --> 00:10:54.200
are very intimate coevolutionary
interactions.

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:57.336
And you can see that in
mitochondria and chloroplasts of

00:10:57.336 --> 00:10:57.850
course.
 

00:10:57.850 --> 00:11:01.118
Then there's this wonderful and
interesting critter called

00:11:01.118 --> 00:11:04.100
Wolbachia, that does lots of
things to arthropods.

00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:07.004
The whole issue of the
symbiosis of algae in reef

00:11:07.004 --> 00:11:10.091
building corals contains a lot
of beautiful biology,

00:11:10.091 --> 00:11:12.090
and some interesting puzzles.
 

00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:16.552
And in all of these cases the
interacting parts are really

00:11:16.552 --> 00:11:18.120
closely connected.
 

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:18.528
Okay?
 

00:11:18.528 --> 00:11:22.532
So there's been a lot of
evolution at the level of

00:11:22.532 --> 00:11:24.820
intercellular metabolism.
 

00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:29.128
And I think that these tight
symbioses are really major

00:11:29.128 --> 00:11:32.558
transitions in the process of
being born.

00:11:32.558 --> 00:11:35.768
So one of the issues in a major
transition is whether or not you

00:11:35.768 --> 00:11:38.570
have a change in the pattern of
genetic transmission.

00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:42.620
And in these cases independent
genomes are getting aligned,

00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:46.889
and in the extreme case of
mitochondria or chloroplasts,

00:11:46.889 --> 00:11:51.294
they actually have the same
pattern of transmission as the

00:11:51.294 --> 00:11:54.889
maternal nuclear genomes,
of the host.

00:11:54.889 --> 00:11:56.200
Okay?
 

00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:59.360
So previously independent
things are being integrated.

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:02.460
Conflicts are being at least
partially resolved;

00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:05.589
although there are traces of
these conflicts--as I told you

00:12:05.589 --> 00:12:07.908
earlier, there are mitochondrial
cancers;

00:12:07.908 --> 00:12:11.149
mitochondria do occasionally
get out of control.

00:12:11.149 --> 00:12:15.183
And there are things like the
petite mutation in yeast,

00:12:15.183 --> 00:12:17.649
which is a mitochondrial issue.
 

00:12:17.649 --> 00:12:21.408
And then this new more or less
well integrated unit has a

00:12:21.408 --> 00:12:22.350
performance.
 

00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:25.177
That performance can vary among
units, and therefore natural

00:12:25.177 --> 00:12:27.428
selection is starting to act on
the new unit.

00:12:27.428 --> 00:12:30.330
So at the formation of the
eukaryotes,

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:33.928
when the mitochondria came in,
you had a new unit,

00:12:33.928 --> 00:12:37.181
and then it was going to
perform with respect to other

00:12:37.181 --> 00:12:39.350
such units,
depending on how well the

00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:41.918
mitochondria were adapted to the
nuclear genome;

00:12:41.918 --> 00:12:45.960
and that's a coevolutionary
process.

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:51.607
Okay, so with mitochondria
you've got all kinds of

00:12:51.607 --> 00:12:56.450
communication and coordination
going on.

00:12:56.450 --> 00:13:03.230
The cell membrane of the
previously independent purple

00:13:03.230 --> 00:13:09.053
sulfur bacterium,
out here, now has within it an

00:13:09.053 --> 00:13:15.691
inner membrane that has got all
kinds of biochemical machinery

00:13:15.691 --> 00:13:17.649
on its surface.
 

00:13:17.649 --> 00:13:19.840
And this is where the citric
acid cycle takes place,

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:23.548
where electrons go down the
electron transport chain,

00:13:23.548 --> 00:13:27.346
making ATP, and in the process
letting a few protons leak out

00:13:27.346 --> 00:13:31.070
into the cytoplasm,
which cause oxidative damage.

00:13:31.070 --> 00:13:33.793
So if you are worried about
eating your blueberries and

00:13:33.793 --> 00:13:38.149
drinking your pomegranate juice,
it is because mitochondria leak

00:13:38.149 --> 00:13:42.580
protons and basically create
hydrogen peroxide in your

00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:45.578
cytoplasm,
and hydrogen peroxide is highly

00:13:45.578 --> 00:13:48.000
oxidative and can do damage in
the cell;

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.767
and there's lots of kinds of
repair machinery to deal with

00:13:51.767 --> 00:13:52.230
that.
 

00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:57.417
This process here of exporting
energy to the cell and getting

00:13:57.417 --> 00:14:02.604
information and substrate into
the mitochondrion is a tightly

00:14:02.604 --> 00:14:06.438
coordinated one,
and there have been lots of

00:14:06.438 --> 00:14:10.179
modifications to the
mitochondrial membrane to make

00:14:10.179 --> 00:14:14.370
it an appropriate filter for the
transport of goods,

00:14:14.370 --> 00:14:15.639
in and out.
 

00:14:15.639 --> 00:14:19.059
So it's been heavily modified
by coevolution.

00:14:19.059 --> 00:14:21.028
Now, Wolbachia.
 

00:14:21.028 --> 00:14:23.799
Wolbachia are very cool
bacteria.

00:14:23.799 --> 00:14:25.820
They're cytoplasmic parasites.
 

00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:29.710
They live in the cytoplasm of
arthropods.

00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:33.110
So they occur in insects and
crustacea.

00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:35.678
They sometimes occur in
nematodes.

00:14:35.678 --> 00:14:41.774
They seem to be able to get
into things, generally speaking,

00:14:41.774 --> 00:14:47.043
in that large chunk of the
tree, which is called the

00:14:47.043 --> 00:14:48.490
ecdysozoa.
 

00:14:48.490 --> 00:14:53.000
And if you just think about the
interests of the Wolbachia,

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:58.168
it can only get into the next
generation if it is in a female,

00:14:58.168 --> 00:15:00.669
because it is transmitted,
like other cytoplasmic

00:15:00.669 --> 00:15:03.711
organelles,
only through eggs and not

00:15:03.711 --> 00:15:05.100
through sperm.
 

00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:09.423
Now this creates some issues
for Wolbachia,

00:15:09.423 --> 00:15:14.470
because if they end up in a
male, they're dead.

00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:18.000
So they have evolved some
interesting ways out of that.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.461
They can induce
parthenogenesis,

00:15:20.461 --> 00:15:21.889
in some species.
 

00:15:21.889 --> 00:15:25.495
So they will take that female
and they will make her asexual,

00:15:25.495 --> 00:15:27.899
and then she makes only female
babies.

00:15:27.899 --> 00:15:31.649
So they get into the eggs of
all of them.

00:15:31.649 --> 00:15:35.139
They can feminize male hosts,
in pill bugs--

00:15:35.139 --> 00:15:38.606
so Armadillidium,
the little pill bug that you

00:15:38.606 --> 00:15:42.711
can find turning over logs--
it's an isopod and a

00:15:42.711 --> 00:15:47.820
crustacean--and when Wolbachia
gets into Armadillidium,

00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:50.966
basically it takes males,
and it has developed a method

00:15:50.966 --> 00:15:53.999
of interfering with its sex
determination process and

00:15:53.999 --> 00:15:56.779
development,
so that anything that's got a

00:15:56.779 --> 00:15:59.558
Wolbachia in it will grow up to
be a female.

00:15:59.558 --> 00:16:02.326
Now, as Wolbachia--and by the
way, this creates a huge

00:16:02.326 --> 00:16:05.354
reproductive advantage for those
females, and they start to

00:16:05.354 --> 00:16:07.129
spread through the population.
 

00:16:07.129 --> 00:16:09.058
They're not suffering the
twofold cost of sex.

00:16:09.058 --> 00:16:11.580
They're only making female
children.

00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:14.249
They spread,
and they take over the

00:16:14.249 --> 00:16:15.269
population.
 

00:16:15.269 --> 00:16:19.736
And then, because there aren't
any males in the population,

00:16:19.736 --> 00:16:23.589
and it's still a sexual
species, Armadillidium goes

00:16:23.589 --> 00:16:27.360
locally extinct;
being driven to extinction by

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:30.899
the selfish cytoplasmic parasite
that it has.

00:16:30.899 --> 00:16:34.361
And the response of some,
but not all,

00:16:34.361 --> 00:16:38.480
Armadillidium populations has
been clever.

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:42.131
They have cut out the sex
determining part of the

00:16:42.131 --> 00:16:46.774
bacterial chromosome and put it
into their nucleus and spliced

00:16:46.774 --> 00:16:49.970
it onto one of their own
chromosomes,

00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:53.929
so that there is now vertical
transmission of that selfish,

00:16:53.929 --> 00:16:55.418
sex-determining element.
 

00:16:55.418 --> 00:16:57.558
They don't really care very
much about the rest of the

00:16:57.558 --> 00:16:59.820
bacterial genome that's been
causing all this problem.

00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:02.293
The only thing that's really
critical is that they got the

00:17:02.293 --> 00:17:06.950
sex determining part out,
and they spliced it into their

00:17:06.950 --> 00:17:10.276
nuclear genome,
through a process that we don't

00:17:10.276 --> 00:17:11.118
really understand.
 

00:17:11.118 --> 00:17:14.546
All we can see is that we can
observe, in some populations,

00:17:14.546 --> 00:17:16.259
that today that's the case.
 

00:17:16.259 --> 00:17:20.140
This means that the conflict
has been removed,

00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:22.470
at least for that
sex-determining element,

00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:24.941
because now it's being
vertically transmitted through

00:17:24.941 --> 00:17:29.410
both the male and female line,
because it's in a nucleus.

00:17:29.410 --> 00:17:33.886
So the conflict disappears,
and a 50:50 sex ratio is

00:17:33.886 --> 00:17:36.592
re-established;
well after awhile,

00:17:36.592 --> 00:17:39.420
because now there's a new sex
chromosome.

00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:39.685
Okay?
 

00:17:39.685 --> 00:17:42.558
So now you have three sex
chromosomes, rather than two,

00:17:42.558 --> 00:17:45.700
for awhile, and so there's a
bit of chaos in sex ratios.

00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:48.413
And then that stabilizes;
you get back to 50:50 sex

00:17:48.413 --> 00:17:48.930
ratios.
 

00:17:48.930 --> 00:17:52.483
And then it gets infected by
Wolbachia, and the whole thing

00:17:52.483 --> 00:17:53.710
starts over again.
 

00:17:53.710 --> 00:17:56.625
And in some cases you can take
the genome of a Armadillidium

00:17:56.625 --> 00:17:58.423
pill bug,
and sequence it,

00:17:58.423 --> 00:18:01.660
and you can find four or five
fossilized,

00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:05.868
sex determining chunks of DNA,
that have been stuck into it.

00:18:05.868 --> 00:18:09.088
So there's an interesting
coevolutionary process going on

00:18:09.088 --> 00:18:09.548
there.
 

00:18:09.548 --> 00:18:13.650
In fruit flies and drosophila,
they cause reproductive

00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:18.368
isolation, and they do that by
cytoplasmic incompatibility.

00:18:18.368 --> 00:18:23.516
That means that a fruit fly is
only going to be able to have

00:18:23.516 --> 00:18:27.117
offspring,
if it's mating with a Wolbachia

00:18:27.117 --> 00:18:31.934
infested fruit fly,
if it's got the same Wolbachia

00:18:31.934 --> 00:18:32.670
in it.
 

00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:36.656
So Wolbachia are biochemical
geniuses and developmental

00:18:36.656 --> 00:18:37.470
geniuses.
 

00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:39.932
They have learned how to
manipulate the sex ratios and

00:18:39.932 --> 00:18:42.628
mating success of their hosts,
and they really haven't been

00:18:42.628 --> 00:18:43.420
domesticated.
 

00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:47.538
And this is kind of interesting
if you go back to the whole

00:18:47.538 --> 00:18:51.657
issue of well what happened when
mitochondria first started

00:18:51.657 --> 00:18:54.500
getting into the eukaryotic
lineage?

00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:58.218
Was there a period 15 hundred
million years when this kind of

00:18:58.218 --> 00:18:59.519
stuff was going on?
 

00:18:59.519 --> 00:19:00.858
Probably was.
 

00:19:00.858 --> 00:19:05.747
It probably took some time to
resolve conflicts and really to

00:19:05.747 --> 00:19:10.390
integrate the mitochondria into
the eukaryotic lineage.

00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:13.837
So when we think about that
overall process of interacting

00:19:13.837 --> 00:19:17.105
genomes, as I mentioned the
frequency of interaction is

00:19:17.105 --> 00:19:18.740
really quite important.
 

00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:22.768
You're not going to get tight
co-adaptation of two different

00:19:22.768 --> 00:19:27.068
species unless they interact
with each other very frequently.

00:19:27.068 --> 00:19:30.318
If they're only interacting
with each other occasionally,

00:19:30.318 --> 00:19:32.720
then there's a lot of stuff
going on,

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:36.358
outside of the interaction,
that has costs and benefits,

00:19:36.358 --> 00:19:40.202
that is going to be tweaking
the interaction traits in other

00:19:40.202 --> 00:19:41.048
directions.
 

00:19:41.048 --> 00:19:45.402
So it's got to be a very
consistent and persistent

00:19:45.402 --> 00:19:49.309
process, to result in tight
co-adaptation.

00:19:49.309 --> 00:19:50.868
So frequency is important.
 

00:19:50.868 --> 00:19:54.374
And then, of course,
when they interact it must make

00:19:54.374 --> 00:19:57.259
some difference to reproductive
success.

00:19:57.259 --> 00:20:00.215
Then there's the issue of
relative evolutionary potential:

00:20:00.215 --> 00:20:02.240
who's got the bigger population
size;

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:04.240
who has the shorter generation
time;

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:06.210
who has more genetic variation?
 

00:20:06.210 --> 00:20:08.589
Those things are certainly
going to help determine the

00:20:08.589 --> 00:20:09.038
outcome.
 

00:20:09.038 --> 00:20:11.391
And then there's this issue of
the Red Queen,

00:20:11.391 --> 00:20:12.619
which I will come to.
 

00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:19.461
So there are some kinds of
interactions,

00:20:19.461 --> 00:20:23.838
ecological interactions,
that favor strong coevolution

00:20:23.838 --> 00:20:25.740
and specialization.
 

00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:29.098
Parasite host interactions,
especially where the--this is

00:20:29.098 --> 00:20:32.640
normally a case where the whole
live cycle is completed on a

00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:34.711
single host;
plant/herbivore and

00:20:34.711 --> 00:20:39.268
predator/prey interactions,
where you have got a fairly

00:20:39.268 --> 00:20:45.938
narrow range of species that are
being eaten by the herbivore or

00:20:45.938 --> 00:20:47.950
by the predator.
 

00:20:47.950 --> 00:20:52.269
And there's one here--pandas
just eat bamboo,

00:20:52.269 --> 00:20:55.220
and therefore that sixth
appendage,

00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:58.317
the panda's thumb,
which is there for handling the

00:20:58.317 --> 00:21:00.910
bamboo shoot,
has evolved.

00:21:00.910 --> 00:21:05.839
Sage grouse basically just eat
sage--they're herbivores--and

00:21:05.839 --> 00:21:10.519
sage has an awful lot of
upsetting biochemistry in it.

00:21:10.519 --> 00:21:14.473
If you were to go out into the
American West and try to live

00:21:14.473 --> 00:21:17.021
for a week on sage,
in the Great Basin,

00:21:17.021 --> 00:21:19.099
you would become very sick.
 

00:21:19.099 --> 00:21:20.868
Sage grouse do it just fine.
 

00:21:20.868 --> 00:21:24.967
They've got all kinds of--it's
probably Cytochrome P450s that

00:21:24.967 --> 00:21:28.586
are the enzymes that are
denaturing the plant products

00:21:28.586 --> 00:21:30.500
that would make us sick.
 

00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:33.275
But the one which is really
kind of sad and funny is the

00:21:33.275 --> 00:21:33.828
aardwolf.
 

00:21:33.828 --> 00:21:41.368
The aardwolf is a hyena that
has specialized on eating ants

00:21:41.368 --> 00:21:44.778
and termites;
that's the only thing it eats,

00:21:44.778 --> 00:21:45.410
as an adult.
 

00:21:45.410 --> 00:21:51.759
Baby aardwolves grow up with
milk, from mom.

00:21:51.759 --> 00:21:53.805
And my friend,
Tim Clutton-Brock,

00:21:53.805 --> 00:21:56.746
has watched the weaning process
in an aardwolf,

00:21:56.746 --> 00:22:00.134
where mother is trying to
convince baby to switch from

00:22:00.134 --> 00:22:01.349
milk to ants.
 

00:22:01.349 --> 00:22:03.599
&gt;
 

00:22:03.599 --> 00:22:06.619
And baby is not happy.
 

00:22:06.619 --> 00:22:09.240
Those ants do not taste good.
 

00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:12.770
And fortunately baby probably
doesn't realize that this is the

00:22:12.770 --> 00:22:15.405
rest of life;
from here on out it's ants,

00:22:15.405 --> 00:22:16.778
all the way through.
 

00:22:16.778 --> 00:22:17.455
Okay?
 

00:22:17.455 --> 00:22:21.650
So that's real specialization.
 

00:22:21.650 --> 00:22:25.671
Another interaction that favors
specialization is mutualism,

00:22:25.671 --> 00:22:29.282
where you have interactions
that are already positive,

00:22:29.282 --> 00:22:31.259
or are becoming positive.
 

00:22:31.259 --> 00:22:33.921
They have symmetrical impacts
on reproductive success,

00:22:33.921 --> 00:22:37.034
and these things are living in
intimate contact for most or all

00:22:37.034 --> 00:22:38.240
of their life cycle.
 

00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:41.050
And mutualisms are very
interesting and they make

00:22:41.050 --> 00:22:44.887
wonderful natural history,
but they also carry the message

00:22:44.887 --> 00:22:47.509
that where it's a win-win
situation,

00:22:47.509 --> 00:22:50.440
evolution is not always about
competition.

00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:53.743
Evolution can be about both
sides profiting from the

00:22:53.743 --> 00:22:56.464
interaction and doing better
because of it,

00:22:56.464 --> 00:22:59.769
and that ends up in a
mutualistic relationship.

00:22:59.769 --> 00:23:02.865
So the relative evolutionary
potential basically is

00:23:02.865 --> 00:23:05.220
determined first by generation
time;

00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:07.058
second by sexual mode.
 

00:23:07.058 --> 00:23:10.890
Sexual partners can evolve more
rapidly than asexual partners,

00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:14.400
and the partner that therefore
has more genetic variation,

00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:16.730
for the interaction trait,
will evolve more rapidly.

00:23:16.730 --> 00:23:20.334
So to some degree we kind of
predict how the coevolutionary

00:23:20.334 --> 00:23:21.640
process will occur.
 

00:23:25.048 --> 00:23:27.925
Now the Red Queen,
which comes from Through the

00:23:27.925 --> 00:23:30.737
Looking Glass,
by Lewis Carroll--and I'll go

00:23:30.737 --> 00:23:34.144
into that a little bit more--
is the idea that there is an

00:23:34.144 --> 00:23:37.951
open-ended struggle that results
in no long-term reduction in

00:23:37.951 --> 00:23:39.598
extinction probability.
 

00:23:39.598 --> 00:23:41.839
Here's an example of a Red
Queen process;

00:23:41.839 --> 00:23:42.779
there are many.
 

00:23:42.779 --> 00:23:45.328
But this would be a
host/parasite interaction.

00:23:45.328 --> 00:23:48.736
And what you see here is
generation time for things that

00:23:48.736 --> 00:23:51.088
have about the same generation
time.

00:23:51.088 --> 00:23:51.348
Okay?
 

00:23:51.348 --> 00:23:54.103
So we have a host and a
parasite that have roughly the

00:23:54.103 --> 00:23:55.348
same generation time.
 

00:23:55.348 --> 00:23:57.130
This is the frequency of an
allele.

00:23:57.130 --> 00:23:58.759
And these are interaction
alleles.

00:23:58.759 --> 00:24:01.378
So these are genes that are
determining how well that

00:24:01.378 --> 00:24:04.250
parasite will do on this host,
and how well this host will

00:24:04.250 --> 00:24:05.509
resist that parasite.
 

00:24:05.509 --> 00:24:10.608
And what's going on here is
that when a certain host allele

00:24:10.608 --> 00:24:15.031
goes up to high frequency,
that turns out to be one that

00:24:15.031 --> 00:24:18.259
this orange parasite allele can
attack very well.

00:24:18.259 --> 00:24:21.518
And so the host has gone into a
state that's susceptible to

00:24:21.518 --> 00:24:24.363
parasite attack;
therefore that parasite allele

00:24:24.363 --> 00:24:25.828
increases in frequency.
 

00:24:25.828 --> 00:24:29.848
But, because that parasite
allele is going up here,

00:24:29.848 --> 00:24:34.753
it's killing a lot of hosts up
here, that host allele drops in

00:24:34.753 --> 00:24:35.880
frequency.
 

00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:39.602
As soon as that one drops in
frequency, it makes the host

00:24:39.602 --> 00:24:42.660
less susceptible,
and the parasite allele drops

00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:43.788
in frequency.
 

00:24:43.788 --> 00:24:46.407
And you can see there's a lag,
there's a lag time between the

00:24:46.407 --> 00:24:46.670
two.
 

00:24:46.670 --> 00:24:50.558
Here it's sketched at about two
or three generations.

00:24:50.558 --> 00:24:55.182
So this light rectangle here is
indicating where the host is not

00:24:55.182 --> 00:24:58.507
having a problem,
and the grey rectangle is

00:24:58.507 --> 00:25:02.000
indicating where the host is
having a problem.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.728
So Leigh Van Valen is a
paleontologist at the University

00:25:05.728 --> 00:25:10.000
of Chicago who came up with the
Red Queen hypothesis in 1973.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:14.071
And he claimed that in fact
it's not just hosts and

00:25:14.071 --> 00:25:16.926
parasites;
he claimed all life on earth is

00:25:16.926 --> 00:25:19.530
in fact caught up in a
coevolutionary web of

00:25:19.530 --> 00:25:20.500
interactions.
 

00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:24.910
And his evidence for that is
that the long-term extinction

00:25:24.910 --> 00:25:26.380
rate is constant.
 

00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:29.450
If you look over the
Phanerozoic, if you look over

00:25:29.450 --> 00:25:32.786
the last 550 million years,
the probability that a species

00:25:32.786 --> 00:25:35.788
will go extinct,
within a given period of time,

00:25:35.788 --> 00:25:37.990
has remained roughly constant.
 

00:25:37.990 --> 00:25:41.290
There's some slight evidence
that maybe species have started

00:25:41.290 --> 00:25:42.970
to live a little bit longer.
 

00:25:42.970 --> 00:25:45.122
But, you know,
broad brush,

00:25:45.122 --> 00:25:47.108
this claim is correct.
 

00:25:47.108 --> 00:25:50.705
Things have not gotten better
at persisting,

00:25:50.705 --> 00:25:53.548
over the last 500 million
years.

00:25:53.548 --> 00:26:00.180
So in some sense I think
Leigh's claim is probably true.

00:26:00.180 --> 00:26:04.234
Every time a species on earth
tries to get a leg up,

00:26:04.234 --> 00:26:06.859
some other species compensates.
 

00:26:09.890 --> 00:26:12.808
So this is where that term
comes from.

00:26:12.808 --> 00:26:17.548
This is an illustration from
Through the Looking Glass

00:26:17.548 --> 00:26:20.470
by Charles Dodgson (Lewis
Carroll).

00:26:20.470 --> 00:26:24.410
This--Alice is a pawn on a
chessboard,

00:26:24.410 --> 00:26:27.970
and Alice is supposed to,
in this mental game,

00:26:27.970 --> 00:26:31.049
march down the chessboard and
get turned into a queen,

00:26:31.049 --> 00:26:32.608
when she reaches the end.
 

00:26:32.608 --> 00:26:34.640
And the Red Queen,
who is next to her,

00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:37.131
says, "Alice,
this is a game in which you run

00:26:37.131 --> 00:26:40.078
as fast as you can and you can
only stay in place."

00:26:40.078 --> 00:26:42.711
So it's like one of those
nightmares that you have,

00:26:42.711 --> 00:26:45.238
where you're running as fast as
you possibly can,

00:26:45.238 --> 00:26:46.660
and you can't get away.
 

00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:49.058
That's Leigh Van Valen's
metaphor for evolution:

00:26:49.058 --> 00:26:51.916
everybody is running as hard as
they can and they're just

00:26:51.916 --> 00:26:55.886
staying in place;
their fitness is not long-term

00:26:55.886 --> 00:26:56.950
improving.
 

00:26:56.950 --> 00:26:59.753
Now I'd like to give you a few
striking outcomes of

00:26:59.753 --> 00:27:00.538
coevolution.
 

00:27:00.538 --> 00:27:03.472
I'm going to do butterfly
mimics, reef-building corals,

00:27:03.472 --> 00:27:05.318
leafcutter ants,
and rinderpest.

00:27:05.318 --> 00:27:08.925
And each of these is making a
slightly different kind of

00:27:08.925 --> 00:27:13.123
point, but each of them involves
some absolutely stunning natural

00:27:13.123 --> 00:27:13.910
history.
 

00:27:13.910 --> 00:27:16.318
So let's start with mimics and
models.

00:27:16.318 --> 00:27:19.383
And these guys are,
by the way, all from the

00:27:19.383 --> 00:27:21.450
Peabody Museum Collections.
 

00:27:21.450 --> 00:27:23.588
So, you know,
if you love butterflies,

00:27:23.588 --> 00:27:25.967
you can go over and talk to the
invertebrate curator at the

00:27:25.967 --> 00:27:28.854
Peabody Collections,
and he can pull out tray after

00:27:28.854 --> 00:27:32.420
tray after tray of thousands of
beautiful butterflies.

00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:34.840
We had one of the great
butterfly biologists here,

00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:35.828
Charles Remington.
 

00:27:35.828 --> 00:27:38.470
And he was buddies with
Vladimir Nabokov,

00:27:38.470 --> 00:27:40.015
who not only wrote
Lolita,

00:27:40.015 --> 00:27:43.256
but was a lepidopterist,
and so we've got some Nabokov

00:27:43.256 --> 00:27:45.858
butterflies in the collection as
well.

00:27:45.858 --> 00:27:47.599
I don't know if any of these
are from Nabokov.

00:27:47.599 --> 00:27:48.588
Okay?
 

00:27:48.588 --> 00:27:54.886
So in Batesian mimicry you've
got an edible model that evolves

00:27:54.886 --> 00:28:00.049
to resemble a warningly colored
noxious species.

00:28:00.049 --> 00:28:01.680
Okay?
 

00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:05.636
So actually what's going
on--I've actually misphrased

00:28:05.636 --> 00:28:07.160
that a little bit.
 

00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:12.205
The noxious one is going to be
the model, and the edible one is

00:28:12.205 --> 00:28:14.160
going to be the mimic.
 

00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:15.150
Sorry about that.
 

00:28:15.150 --> 00:28:16.808
I'm going to go back and
correct that.

00:28:16.808 --> 00:28:21.759
So the mimic is good to eat and
the model is bad to eat.

00:28:21.759 --> 00:28:27.019
And on Madagascar there aren't
any models, and the male and the

00:28:27.019 --> 00:28:30.328
female look the same in this
species.

00:28:30.328 --> 00:28:32.971
But as you go out,
through Africa,

00:28:32.971 --> 00:28:37.136
you find that in different
places in Africa there are

00:28:37.136 --> 00:28:42.280
different nasty tasting models,
and the female turns into

00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:46.078
something that looks very much
like them.

00:28:46.078 --> 00:28:50.084
So this thing has evolved into
all of these other things,

00:28:50.084 --> 00:28:53.160
depending upon where they are,
in Africa.

00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:54.838
Now this is not simple.
 

00:28:54.838 --> 00:28:57.981
It takes a lot of genes to turn
something like that into

00:28:57.981 --> 00:28:59.240
something like that.
 

00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:02.191
And when you go into a
neighboring race--it's still in

00:29:02.191 --> 00:29:04.906
the same species;
the males are still looking

00:29:04.906 --> 00:29:08.282
like that--you have to have a
whole bunch of coordinated

00:29:08.282 --> 00:29:10.798
changes to make it into the
other one.

00:29:10.798 --> 00:29:13.990
So what's happened is that
these genes have been pulled

00:29:13.990 --> 00:29:15.748
together,
onto a chromosome,

00:29:15.748 --> 00:29:18.019
and turned into a super-gene
complex,

00:29:18.019 --> 00:29:21.630
which has been inverted so that
it doesn't recombine,

00:29:21.630 --> 00:29:22.980
and they're inherited as a
package.

00:29:28.019 --> 00:29:34.759
Now in Mullerian mimicry you
have a process whereby things

00:29:34.759 --> 00:29:40.910
that all taste bad evolve to
look like each other.

00:29:40.910 --> 00:29:44.843
Can anybody tell me why things
that all taste bad might evolve

00:29:44.843 --> 00:29:46.519
to look like each other?
 

00:29:46.519 --> 00:29:47.670
What's the advantage in that?
 

00:29:47.670 --> 00:29:48.490
Yes?
 

00:29:48.490 --> 00:29:57.809

00:29:57.809 --> 00:29:58.808
Prof: Right, exactly.
 

00:29:58.808 --> 00:30:02.994
So basically what they're doing
is they're making it as easy as

00:30:02.994 --> 00:30:06.844
possible for the predator's
learning process to figure out

00:30:06.844 --> 00:30:10.220
that all things that look like
this taste bad.

00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:13.734
They're reducing the mistake
rate, in the things that are

00:30:13.734 --> 00:30:15.430
learning not to eat them.
 

00:30:15.430 --> 00:30:19.885
So these are the Heliconia
butterflies of South America,

00:30:19.885 --> 00:30:23.368
and they live all on passion
fruit vines.

00:30:23.368 --> 00:30:25.855
So there's a big radiation of
different species of passion

00:30:25.855 --> 00:30:28.337
fruit in South America,
and these butterflies all lay

00:30:28.337 --> 00:30:30.990
their eggs on those different
species of passion fruit,

00:30:30.990 --> 00:30:34.296
and where they overlap,
the different species have

00:30:34.296 --> 00:30:36.588
evolved to look like each other.
 

00:30:36.588 --> 00:30:42.205
So what we have here is
Mullerian mimicry going on here,

00:30:42.205 --> 00:30:45.156
and here;
and we have Batesian going

00:30:45.156 --> 00:30:47.900
on--excuse, me,
this is all Mullerian;

00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:50.259
this is Batesian mimicry.
 

00:30:50.259 --> 00:30:53.558
So Mullerian is everybody
distasteful.

00:30:53.558 --> 00:30:58.558
This is a Batesian mimic of all
of these distasteful models.

00:30:58.558 --> 00:31:01.750
This is a Batesian mimic of all
of these distasteful models;

00:31:01.750 --> 00:31:02.470
and so forth.
 

00:31:05.588 --> 00:31:08.828
So, those are pretty precise
adaptations.

00:31:08.828 --> 00:31:12.147
I mean, if it gets to the point
where a good naturalist really

00:31:12.147 --> 00:31:15.356
has to puzzle for awhile to
identify whether you're looking-

00:31:15.356 --> 00:31:17.858
dealing with the model or with
the mimic,

00:31:17.858 --> 00:31:20.920
and has to really know their
details of morphology,

00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:25.160
it means that natural selection
has precisely adjusted virtually

00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:29.394
every part of the body,
so that the mimic really looks

00:31:29.394 --> 00:31:30.720
like the model.
 

00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:34.525
Now a tight symbiotic
relationship is between- is the

00:31:34.525 --> 00:31:37.013
one that's between
dinoflagellates,

00:31:37.013 --> 00:31:40.818
that are called zooxanthellae,
and their corals.

00:31:40.818 --> 00:31:44.858
And there are also--so here is
a coral.

00:31:44.858 --> 00:31:48.141
And, by the way,
there are also zooxanthellae

00:31:48.141 --> 00:31:51.048
living in the lip of this giant
clam.

00:31:51.048 --> 00:31:56.328
So this giant clam and the
coral are both farming algae.

00:31:56.328 --> 00:32:01.575
And the algae are
photosynthesizing and delivering

00:32:01.575 --> 00:32:04.680
photosynthate,
to the host.

00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:11.154
And you can see here the
chloroplast of one of these

00:32:11.154 --> 00:32:17.503
algae, and its body is in here,
and it is producing

00:32:17.503 --> 00:32:21.681
photosynthate;
and these are the starches that

00:32:21.681 --> 00:32:22.838
it's accumulating.
 

00:32:22.838 --> 00:32:25.808
Now the relationship goes
something like this.

00:32:25.808 --> 00:32:29.410
The dynoflagellates,
which by the way look like this

00:32:29.410 --> 00:32:33.868
when they're out in open water;
they're really quite lovely.

00:32:33.868 --> 00:32:36.078
And remember,
these are some of the guys that

00:32:36.078 --> 00:32:38.690
have so many membranes around
their chloroplasts,

00:32:38.690 --> 00:32:43.886
because they're the result of
three or four ingestion events

00:32:43.886 --> 00:32:46.088
over evolutionary time.
 

00:32:46.088 --> 00:32:50.724
If they produce say 250 joules
of energy, through

00:32:50.724 --> 00:32:54.876
photosynthesis,
they export 225 of it to the

00:32:54.876 --> 00:32:59.207
corals;
and they only put about .2 into

00:32:59.207 --> 00:33:02.578
growth and 25 into respiration.
 

00:33:02.578 --> 00:33:07.858
So they've been almost
completely domesticated.

00:33:07.858 --> 00:33:11.045
Pig farmers have been trying
for hundreds of years to get

00:33:11.045 --> 00:33:13.150
pigs that would be this
efficient,

00:33:13.150 --> 00:33:16.378
for humans, and these corals
have turned these

00:33:16.378 --> 00:33:20.614
dinoflagellates into a energy
conversion machine that's just

00:33:20.614 --> 00:33:23.990
incredibly efficient,
from their own point of view.

00:33:23.990 --> 00:33:26.170
The corals, of course,
have tentacles,

00:33:26.170 --> 00:33:28.742
and they will feed on
zooplankton and stuff which is

00:33:28.742 --> 00:33:30.925
out there,
but they only get about

00:33:30.925 --> 00:33:34.180
1/10^(th) of their energy from
feeding directly;

00:33:34.180 --> 00:33:35.858
they get most of it from
photosynthesis.

00:33:35.858 --> 00:33:39.151
And then what they do is they
put a little bit of it into

00:33:39.151 --> 00:33:39.680
growth.
 

00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:44.324
They put a lot of it into their
calcified skeleton--so basically

00:33:44.324 --> 00:33:47.420
you're looking at where reefs
come from;

00:33:47.420 --> 00:33:50.980
this is how a reef is
produced--and then they lose

00:33:50.980 --> 00:33:55.343
quite a bit to respiration and
to the mucus that they produce

00:33:55.343 --> 00:33:56.868
in their feeding.
 

00:33:56.868 --> 00:34:01.117
So they're getting about ten
times the energy from their

00:34:01.117 --> 00:34:04.980
symbiotic algae as they are from
direct feeding.

00:34:04.980 --> 00:34:09.746
Now one of the implications of
this is this is why you do not

00:34:09.746 --> 00:34:13.719
find reef-building corals deeper
than 20 meters.

00:34:13.719 --> 00:34:16.418
It's because there's not enough
light for the algae,

00:34:16.418 --> 00:34:17.900
any deeper than 20 meters.
 

00:34:17.900 --> 00:34:20.429
Okay?
 

00:34:20.429 --> 00:34:25.869
Now the crazy thing about this
system is that a baby coral has

00:34:25.869 --> 00:34:31.132
to acquire the algae in each
generation, and the algae exist

00:34:31.132 --> 00:34:33.539
as independent species.
 

00:34:33.539 --> 00:34:37.590
So the algae are actually
incredibly phenotypically

00:34:37.590 --> 00:34:40.867
plastic;
they have a free-living form,

00:34:40.867 --> 00:34:45.632
and they have a domesticated
form, and they can reproduce

00:34:45.632 --> 00:34:46.739
both ways.
 

00:34:46.739 --> 00:34:51.255
And that's very interesting
because from the point of view

00:34:51.255 --> 00:34:54.425
of the algae,
the free-living form is the

00:34:54.425 --> 00:34:58.150
source and the domesticated form
is a sink;

00:34:58.150 --> 00:35:04.289
and it's therefore puzzling to
see how it was that the corals

00:35:04.289 --> 00:35:07.768
were able to engineer the algae.
 

00:35:07.768 --> 00:35:10.780
There's got to be some kind of
coupling of the cycle so that

00:35:10.780 --> 00:35:14.099
what goes on in the coral feeds
back into the free-living form;

00:35:14.099 --> 00:35:19.159
otherwise you couldn't get this
tight adaptation.

00:35:19.159 --> 00:35:23.309
They're re-domesticated in each
generation, in the coral.

00:35:23.309 --> 00:35:28.831
Okay, now for a
macroevolutionary,

00:35:28.831 --> 00:35:32.679
coevolutionary story.
 

00:35:32.679 --> 00:35:36.353
How many of you have been in
the Tropics and have seen

00:35:36.353 --> 00:35:37.670
leafcutting ants?
 

00:35:37.670 --> 00:35:39.690
Four or five, six.
 

00:35:39.690 --> 00:35:43.380
These guys are great,
and they form huge colonies.

00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:47.601
The chamber that they can form
is the size of this dais up

00:35:47.601 --> 00:35:48.119
here.
 

00:35:48.119 --> 00:35:50.280
It will be three or four feet
high,

00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:53.150
and if you're out in a
rainforest, the cutting

00:35:53.150 --> 00:35:56.916
activities of the workers will
actually clear all the leaves

00:35:56.916 --> 00:35:58.916
off the trees,
over the chamber,

00:35:58.916 --> 00:36:02.034
right to the canopy;
so you kind of exist in a well

00:36:02.034 --> 00:36:05.253
in the forest,
where the ants have essentially

00:36:05.253 --> 00:36:07.972
punched right through,
200,250 feet up,

00:36:07.972 --> 00:36:10.190
taking out all the leaves.
 

00:36:10.190 --> 00:36:13.023
And they take them down,
into their underground chamber,

00:36:13.023 --> 00:36:15.960
where they chew them up and
they feed them to a fungus.

00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:21.059
And they domesticated this
fungus 50 million years ago.

00:36:21.059 --> 00:36:21.327
Okay?
 

00:36:21.327 --> 00:36:24.264
Humans figured out how to
domesticate wheat 10,000 years

00:36:24.264 --> 00:36:24.639
ago.
 

00:36:24.639 --> 00:36:28.250
The ants domesticated the
fungus 50 million years ago.

00:36:28.250 --> 00:36:31.427
They're the first farmers;
well the corals probably did it

00:36:31.427 --> 00:36:31.949
earlier.
 

00:36:31.949 --> 00:36:32.380
Okay?
 

00:36:32.380 --> 00:36:35.909
But this is another
domestication event.

00:36:35.909 --> 00:36:40.630
So they cultivate this fungus
clonally.

00:36:40.630 --> 00:36:44.978
The fungus can't reproduce
sexually, in the colony,

00:36:44.978 --> 00:36:49.501
and it looks like it's been
asexual ever since it was

00:36:49.501 --> 00:36:50.980
domesticated.
 

00:36:50.980 --> 00:36:52.800
It's a monoculture.
 

00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:56.583
Now in human agriculture,
a monoculture is incredibly

00:36:56.583 --> 00:36:58.840
vulnerable to plant diseases.
 

00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:02.119
Having a continent covered by a
single strain of wheat,

00:37:02.119 --> 00:37:06.382
or a single strain of sorghum,
or a single strain of sugarcane

00:37:06.382 --> 00:37:09.190
is a bad idea,
because pathogens will evolve

00:37:09.190 --> 00:37:11.650
onto that particular monoculture
genotype,

00:37:11.650 --> 00:37:14.038
and they can go through in an
epidemic and wipe the whole

00:37:14.038 --> 00:37:14.550
thing out.
 

00:37:14.550 --> 00:37:18.768
So having a mix of genotypes in
agriculture is a very good idea.

00:37:18.768 --> 00:37:22.750
Well that's not what the
leafcutter ants did.

00:37:26.789 --> 00:37:30.391
They have a pathogen that can
attack their own--okay?--and

00:37:30.391 --> 00:37:31.719
it's also a fungus.
 

00:37:31.719 --> 00:37:34.072
So there's another fungus that
can come into the colony and

00:37:34.072 --> 00:37:35.250
take over their own fungus.
 

00:37:35.250 --> 00:37:38.871
But to fight it,
they cultivate a bacterium,

00:37:38.871 --> 00:37:43.672
and they use that bacterium as
a defense against the enemy

00:37:43.672 --> 00:37:44.599
fungus.
 

00:37:44.599 --> 00:37:48.309
And they have a- they've
evolved a special morphological

00:37:48.309 --> 00:37:51.210
pouch in which they carry this
bacterium.

00:37:51.210 --> 00:37:53.994
And you'll notice that because
it's a bacterium,

00:37:53.994 --> 00:37:55.949
it has a short generation time.
 

00:37:55.949 --> 00:37:59.922
So they have the coevolutionary
arms race matched up in terms of

00:37:59.922 --> 00:38:00.489
timing.
 

00:38:00.489 --> 00:38:04.079
They have a bacterium that can
evolve as fast,

00:38:04.079 --> 00:38:07.829
or faster, than the fungus that
infects them.

00:38:07.829 --> 00:38:11.561
So they have not only
domesticated their food supply,

00:38:11.561 --> 00:38:15.579
they've also invented a health
delivery system to keep it

00:38:15.579 --> 00:38:17.159
healthy;
they have a pharmacy.

00:38:20.889 --> 00:38:26.219
Now if you look at the
macroevolution of this system,

00:38:26.219 --> 00:38:30.710
what you see here basically is
the phylogeny of the ant,

00:38:30.710 --> 00:38:34.052
the phylogeny of their fungus,
and the phylogeny of their

00:38:34.052 --> 00:38:36.869
parasite,
over here.

00:38:36.869 --> 00:38:40.639
And the thing that I want you
to notice is that although it's

00:38:40.639 --> 00:38:43.844
not absolutely precise,
these things match up pretty

00:38:43.844 --> 00:38:44.409
well.
 

00:38:44.409 --> 00:38:46.800
So the parts that are in
blue--I mean,

00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:51.170
sometimes you find a few more
parasites,

00:38:51.170 --> 00:38:56.150
hitting a few more cultivars,
but roughly speaking if there's

00:38:56.150 --> 00:38:59.719
a branch at a certain point in
the tree,

00:38:59.719 --> 00:39:02.409
it is a branch for all three
things.

00:39:02.409 --> 00:39:05.570
It's not precisely matched,
but it's pretty close.

00:39:05.570 --> 00:39:07.380
This is an amazing system.
 

00:39:07.380 --> 00:39:11.266
And when Ulrich Mueller,
who has worked on it--and this

00:39:11.266 --> 00:39:14.650
is actually-- he's a co-author
on this paper.

00:39:14.650 --> 00:39:18.780
He's a professor at the
University of Texas in Austin.

00:39:18.780 --> 00:39:21.306
When he visited and gave a talk
on it, I asked Ulrich,

00:39:21.306 --> 00:39:23.500
"How did you come to this
system?"

00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:25.965
And he said,
"Well, about twenty-five

00:39:25.965 --> 00:39:29.108
years ago I took an OTS course,
and we were sitting there in

00:39:29.108 --> 00:39:31.824
Costa Rica,
and we played the 50 Questions

00:39:31.824 --> 00:39:34.422
game,
and my question was about

00:39:34.422 --> 00:39:36.340
leafcutter ants."
 

00:39:36.340 --> 00:39:38.440
And that's his career.
 

00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:39.570
Okay?
 

00:39:39.570 --> 00:39:43.510
Questions have profound
influence.

00:39:43.510 --> 00:39:48.159
Okay, rinderpest,
the final one in this series.

00:39:48.159 --> 00:39:50.219
The point about rinderpest is
this.

00:39:50.219 --> 00:39:53.394
I'm giving you this example to
show you what happens when

00:39:53.394 --> 00:39:56.570
evolution has not occurred;
and that gives you a feel for

00:39:56.570 --> 00:39:59.050
what has happened when evolution
has occurred.

00:39:59.050 --> 00:40:01.030
Okay?
 

00:40:01.030 --> 00:40:04.570
So this is the rinderpest
pathogen.

00:40:04.570 --> 00:40:07.373
It's a virus,
and it attacks cattle,

00:40:07.373 --> 00:40:09.695
buffalo, eland,
kudu, giraffe,

00:40:09.695 --> 00:40:12.659
bushbuck, warthogs and bush
pigs;

00:40:12.659 --> 00:40:14.219
those are all ungulates.
 

00:40:14.219 --> 00:40:18.000
So it is attacking one clade on
the mammalian tree;

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:21.159
they're all things that have
two hooves.

00:40:21.159 --> 00:40:24.541
And it evolved in Asia,
and it came into Europe through

00:40:24.541 --> 00:40:26.420
human invasions,
repeatedly.

00:40:26.420 --> 00:40:30.251
So things in Asia and Europe
had evolutionary experience of

00:40:30.251 --> 00:40:33.480
rinderpest;
they'd been exposed to this

00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:34.268
disease.
 

00:40:34.268 --> 00:40:38.144
However, things in Africa had
not, and it got into Africa

00:40:38.144 --> 00:40:42.159
probably either when the
Italians went into Somaliland,

00:40:42.159 --> 00:40:45.532
or when General Gordon brought
in some Russian cattle when he

00:40:45.532 --> 00:40:49.686
went to relieve Khartoum;
so in the 1880s rinderpest got

00:40:49.686 --> 00:40:54.786
into Africa, and it came in
because Europeans were bringing

00:40:54.786 --> 00:40:56.809
cattle in with them.
 

00:40:56.809 --> 00:40:59.273
And by 1890,
it had crossed the Sahara,

00:40:59.273 --> 00:41:01.480
and gotten into Southern
Africa.

00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:04.590
So there were some direct
consequences.

00:41:04.590 --> 00:41:07.797
It eliminated--in the 1890s it
took out most of the domestic

00:41:07.797 --> 00:41:10.570
cattle and wild buffalo,
and many related bovids.

00:41:10.570 --> 00:41:13.449
This caused enormous famine and
disruption in the humans who

00:41:13.449 --> 00:41:16.282
were living in Africa and who
either had domestic cattle or

00:41:16.282 --> 00:41:17.210
nomadic cattle.
 

00:41:17.210 --> 00:41:19.737
So, you know,
the Masai really got hammered

00:41:19.737 --> 00:41:20.340
by this.
 

00:41:20.340 --> 00:41:22.925
Only one species went
extinct--it was a species of

00:41:22.925 --> 00:41:25.782
antelope--
but the distributions of all of

00:41:25.782 --> 00:41:29.369
the other wild ungulates in
Africa were altered,

00:41:29.369 --> 00:41:32.280
and they remain altered to this
day.

00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:35.041
They're springing back in some
areas, and there are now

00:41:35.041 --> 00:41:38.315
vaccines for rinderpest that are
being used on domestic cattle in

00:41:38.315 --> 00:41:39.800
places like South Africa.
 

00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:43.557
So the distributions are
altering, but you can still see

00:41:43.557 --> 00:41:45.539
the signature of the event.
 

00:41:45.539 --> 00:41:49.798
People lost food supplies,
and there was an outbreak of

00:41:49.798 --> 00:41:53.268
endemic smallpox,
while this was going on.

00:41:53.268 --> 00:41:57.802
So it started causing a cascade
of effects, through the

00:41:57.802 --> 00:41:58.809
ecosystem.
 

00:41:58.809 --> 00:42:01.844
There were epizootics--an
epizootic is like an epidemic,

00:42:01.844 --> 00:42:04.659
except it happens in
populations of wild animals.

00:42:04.659 --> 00:42:08.389
So there were epizootics in
1917/18;

00:42:08.389 --> 00:42:11.297
so right at the time of the
outbreak of the World Flu

00:42:11.297 --> 00:42:13.610
Epidemic,
people in Africa were also

00:42:13.610 --> 00:42:17.206
getting hammered by another
outbreak of rinderpest hitting

00:42:17.206 --> 00:42:18.280
their animals.
 

00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:21.539
1923; 1938 to '41.
 

00:42:21.539 --> 00:42:27.510
This is the kind of habitat in
which rinderpest was spreading.

00:42:27.510 --> 00:42:29.610
There were some interesting
indirect consequences.

00:42:29.610 --> 00:42:32.829
So over a lot of the infected
area,

00:42:32.829 --> 00:42:36.735
tsetse flies disappeared,
and the reason tsetse flies

00:42:36.735 --> 00:42:40.717
disappeared is that they make
their living off of wild

00:42:40.717 --> 00:42:41.768
ungulates.
 

00:42:41.768 --> 00:42:44.750
So if there aren't any
wildebeest or giraffes around

00:42:44.750 --> 00:42:48.023
for the tsetse flies to eat,
they will disappear from the

00:42:48.023 --> 00:42:48.550
area.
 

00:42:48.550 --> 00:42:52.726
Now they require trees and
bushes as their habitat,

00:42:52.726 --> 00:42:55.400
and herbivores for their food.
 

00:42:55.400 --> 00:42:58.786
Now when the herbivores
disappeared because of

00:42:58.786 --> 00:43:02.630
rinderpest,
the tsetses lost their food,

00:43:02.630 --> 00:43:08.340
but their habitat sprang up,
because there weren't ungulates

00:43:08.340 --> 00:43:13.170
eating the bushes that the
tsetse flies would live in.

00:43:13.170 --> 00:43:15.981
When things like wildebeest
disappeared, the lions got

00:43:15.981 --> 00:43:18.900
hungry, and there were outbreaks
of man-eating lions.

00:43:18.900 --> 00:43:22.135
So in the 1920s,
during a rinderpest epidemic,

00:43:22.135 --> 00:43:25.230
there was one lion that killed
84 people.

00:43:25.230 --> 00:43:27.239
When I first went to Queen
Elizabeth National Park,

00:43:27.239 --> 00:43:31.760
in 1992, there were people
living in the park,

00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:35.467
squatters living in the park,
and they would try to get to

00:43:35.467 --> 00:43:38.402
the store at Park Headquarters,
on a bicycle,

00:43:38.402 --> 00:43:41.856
and the lions had learned that
it was possible to separate that

00:43:41.856 --> 00:43:44.530
blob on top of this funny
two-wheeled thing,

00:43:44.530 --> 00:43:47.159
from what was moving so fast.
 

00:43:47.159 --> 00:43:49.880
And so like pussycats chasing
balls of twine,

00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:52.449
they had gotten into knocking
over bicycles and eating people,

00:43:52.449 --> 00:43:55.322
and there had been thirteen
people who had been killed in

00:43:55.322 --> 00:43:57.170
the two months before we
arrived,

00:43:57.170 --> 00:43:59.518
in Queen Elizabeth National
Park.

00:43:59.518 --> 00:44:01.980
That kind of thing still goes
on.

00:44:01.980 --> 00:44:06.911
So the lions contributed to the
abandonment of big areas,

00:44:06.911 --> 00:44:09.730
and thickets of brush grew up.
 

00:44:09.730 --> 00:44:12.422
So the ungulates went down,
and the people pulled back,

00:44:12.422 --> 00:44:13.519
and the bushes grew.
 

00:44:18.139 --> 00:44:22.405
Now when the ungulates
developed some immunity to

00:44:22.405 --> 00:44:25.179
rinderpest,
and they moved back into the

00:44:25.179 --> 00:44:28.179
abandoned farming areas,
they then became hosts for

00:44:28.179 --> 00:44:31.340
tsetse flies that could now live
in the new bushes.

00:44:31.340 --> 00:44:31.635
Okay?
 

00:44:31.635 --> 00:44:35.251
So you see rinderpest goes in,
and it changes a bunch of stuff

00:44:35.251 --> 00:44:37.858
ecologically,
and it changes the geography of

00:44:37.858 --> 00:44:38.570
Africa.
 

00:44:38.570 --> 00:44:41.880
And the flies transmit sleeping
sickness;

00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:43.922
so they do that,
by the way, both in the

00:44:43.922 --> 00:44:47.119
ungulates and--sleeping sickness
is a real problem in domestic

00:44:47.119 --> 00:44:48.849
cattle, as well as in people.
 

00:44:48.849 --> 00:44:51.826
And so the humans really pulled
out of this area,

00:44:51.826 --> 00:44:55.608
and they remained absent even
after the lions switched back to

00:44:55.608 --> 00:44:57.159
eating the ungulates.
 

00:44:57.159 --> 00:45:00.260
If you go into the Serengeti,
just west of Seronera,

00:45:00.260 --> 00:45:03.239
there is a valley between
Seronera and Lake Victoria,

00:45:03.239 --> 00:45:05.619
which is called The Valley of
Death,

00:45:05.619 --> 00:45:07.907
and that's because of the
sleeping sickness that's endemic

00:45:07.907 --> 00:45:10.858
in the valley;
and that's an example of what

00:45:10.858 --> 00:45:12.849
happens in this process.
 

00:45:12.849 --> 00:45:18.434
And by the way,
we call these areas now,

00:45:18.434 --> 00:45:25.880
to a certain extent,
the National Parks of Africa.

00:45:25.880 --> 00:45:29.041
So if you wonder why those
parks are where they are,

00:45:29.041 --> 00:45:32.449
in part it's due to the history
that I just told you.

00:45:32.449 --> 00:45:35.880
So rinderpest changed the
ecological structure of at least

00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:38.289
half a continent,
for about a century.

00:45:38.289 --> 00:45:41.945
The consequences were pretty
bad, and they were only kind of

00:45:41.945 --> 00:45:43.679
predictable in retrospect.
 

00:45:43.679 --> 00:45:47.331
Nobody had the knowledge,
when General Gordon relieved

00:45:47.331 --> 00:45:49.536
Khartoum,
with a few Russian cattle in

00:45:49.536 --> 00:45:52.480
his supply train,
that they were carrying a virus

00:45:52.480 --> 00:45:55.139
that would do this to a whole
continent.

00:45:55.139 --> 00:45:56.139
Okay?
 

00:45:56.139 --> 00:46:00.016
I think that this is one of
those places where we have to be

00:46:00.016 --> 00:46:04.090
extremely modest about how much
we understand about ecology and

00:46:04.090 --> 00:46:05.010
evolution.
 

00:46:05.010 --> 00:46:08.949
Bad shit can happen.
 

00:46:08.949 --> 00:46:16.789
So the same thing happened in
the New World when Europeans,

00:46:16.789 --> 00:46:19.494
who were relatively resistant
to smallpox and measles and

00:46:19.494 --> 00:46:21.911
things like that,
brought with them their

00:46:21.911 --> 00:46:25.829
diseases, and that is why they
were able to overthrow the Aztec

00:46:25.829 --> 00:46:26.840
civilization.
 

00:46:26.840 --> 00:46:29.376
If you ever ask yourself,
how the heck did a couple of

00:46:29.376 --> 00:46:32.250
hundred Conquistadores wipe out
an Aztec army of 100,000,

00:46:32.250 --> 00:46:35.170
the answer is the Aztecs were
all sick and dying,

00:46:35.170 --> 00:46:37.938
and by the time the
Conquistadores got to Mexico

00:46:37.938 --> 00:46:39.436
City,
from Vera Cruz,

00:46:39.436 --> 00:46:42.110
the epidemic had spread ahead
of them;

00:46:42.110 --> 00:46:45.302
and that happened all over the
New World and all over

00:46:45.302 --> 00:46:46.039
Polynesia.
 

00:46:46.039 --> 00:46:50.815
So the point of this basically
is we want to compare what

00:46:50.815 --> 00:46:56.360
happened in Africa with what did
not happen in Asia and Europe.

00:46:56.360 --> 00:46:59.958
The Eurasian ungulates have a
long evolutionary history with

00:46:59.958 --> 00:47:03.802
rinderpest, and the ones that we
see there are the ones that are

00:47:03.802 --> 00:47:05.639
not extinct;
they made it.

00:47:05.639 --> 00:47:07.349
Okay?
 

00:47:07.349 --> 00:47:11.577
And if we summarize coevolution
as a whole, there are lots of

00:47:11.577 --> 00:47:13.199
things that coevolve.
 

00:47:13.199 --> 00:47:16.159
It's not just species that are
coevolving with each other;

00:47:16.159 --> 00:47:18.349
it happens at many scales.
 

00:47:18.349 --> 00:47:22.333
And that means that other
living things are among the most

00:47:22.333 --> 00:47:25.760
important elements of the
selected environment.

00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:30.744
So you shouldn't think of
organisms as being faced only by

00:47:30.744 --> 00:47:36.079
challenges of temperature and
rainfall and stuff like that.

00:47:36.079 --> 00:47:40.143
Really, once life got going,
the different species on the

00:47:40.143 --> 00:47:44.860
planet became each other's most
important interaction partners.

00:47:44.860 --> 00:47:48.289
Part of this is running just as
fast as you can to stay in one

00:47:48.289 --> 00:47:50.467
place;
and this Red Queen concept is

00:47:50.467 --> 00:47:53.449
probably particularly
appropriate for the virulence

00:47:53.449 --> 00:47:57.063
resistance paradigm,
and for the evolution of sex as

00:47:57.063 --> 00:47:59.389
an adaptation against parasites.
 

00:47:59.389 --> 00:48:02.159
And as the rinderpest example
shows us,

00:48:02.159 --> 00:48:06.773
the extent of coevolution is
particularly strikingly revealed

00:48:06.773 --> 00:48:11.539
when you see a foreign species
invade another continent after a

00:48:11.539 --> 00:48:13.769
long period of isolation.
 

00:48:13.769 --> 00:48:14.809
Okay.
